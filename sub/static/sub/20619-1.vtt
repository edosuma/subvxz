00:18.310 --> 00:22.272
Bodyguards.
Protection agents. Muscle.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.274
Whatever you want to call them,

00:24.483 --> 00:29.238
these people are on the front-lines
for the rich, famous, and powerful.

00:29.655 --> 00:33.325
Not only do they see it all,
but they deal with it all.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.538
The good, the bad,
the really fucking bad...

00:38.205 --> 00:39.289
and the ugly.

00:39.873 --> 00:43.877
Five stories,
five completely different worlds.

00:44.294 --> 00:48.006
Explore the lives of those
at the top of the protection field.

00:48.131 --> 00:51.552
Seeing what it's truly like
to guard society's elite.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.262
Showcasing the individuals
who have protected

00:54.346 --> 00:57.099
the likes of world-famous
politician, Nelson Mandela,

00:57.849 --> 01:00.310
Hip Hop's royalty,
50 Cent and Lil' Wayne

01:01.144 --> 01:04.397
one of America's most notorious
gangsters, Whitey Bulger,

01:05.147 --> 01:07.401
American ambassadors
under Blackwater,

01:08.110 --> 01:10.654
and global superstar, Justin Bieber.

01:11.446 --> 01:15.200
Buckle up. It's time to pull back
the curtain on the inner workings

01:15.284 --> 01:18.120
of an industry that most people
know nothing about.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.978
Welcome to Miami Beach

01:44.062 --> 01:46.940
where we meet Anton,
one of the most well known

01:47.024 --> 01:49.318
and respected bodyguards
in the business.

01:49.901 --> 01:53.071
Anton cut his chops protecting
50 Cent in his prime

01:53.155 --> 01:56.617
where bullet proof vests were
mandatory and fights were daily.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.787
Gaining respect by getting
shot on the job with 50,

02:00.871 --> 02:03.790
Anton has protected some
of the biggest names in music.

02:04.291 --> 02:08.669
After being on the front line for years,
Anton started his own bodyguard company,

02:09.253 --> 02:10.672
Guardian Protection.

02:11.423 --> 02:15.552
Our story looks at what it takes
to go from beating people up every day

02:15.636 --> 02:19.056
to running one of the biggest
bodyguard companies in the USA.

02:19.222 --> 02:23.143
I did 50 Cent for four years.
In 2005, I left to start Guardian.

02:23.352 --> 02:25.687
Guardian is a full-service
security agency. We do everything.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.731
We do concerts, events, night clubs.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.400
Personal bodyguard work.
That's what we're known most for.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.986
I protected Eve,
she was my first client with Guardian.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.656
Ciara, at the time,
was headlining the Scream Tour.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.407
I was with Ciara for a couple of years.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.076
That lead to T-Pain.
I was with him for a couple of years.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.622
That's when Pain had 13 number ones
in one year, the year of T-Pain

02:43.830 --> 02:46.249
Lil Wayne, Timbaland, Birdman,

02:46.333 --> 02:49.961
DJ Khaled, Keri Hilson,
Future, Gym Class Heroes.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.672
What up? It's Travie McCoy
from Gym Class Heroes.

02:52.756 --> 02:55.550
Guardian got my back. All day, any day.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.427
All the while, while I was
protecting all these people,

02:58.011 --> 02:59.888
I was gaining other clients.

03:00.222 --> 03:03.100
I gained Lil Wayne, so I became
Lil Wayne's bodyguard.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.477
Wayne's getting out of jail.
He was in Riker's Island

03:05.769 --> 03:08.146
That was my first day on the job,
when Wayne got out.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.067
His manager said, "I'd like you
to be his head of security."

03:12.442 --> 03:14.611
And I've been with him
for five or six years.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.196
Through a mixture of me being
in the clubs and on the road,

03:17.280 --> 03:18.823
I was able to get other clients.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.159
Shawn Mendes, Austin Mahone,

03:21.785 --> 03:25.288
Alicia Keys, Pharrell,
Ariana Grande,

03:25.789 --> 03:26.832
the Kardashians.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.959
As I'd get these clients,
I'd work them first

03:30.043 --> 03:31.670
and show them how Guardian does it.

03:31.920 --> 03:36.924
Then I'd go to my pool of bouncers.
And Josh Ponder is my operations manager.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.094
I'd ask, "Who do you think
could be a bodyguard?"

03:39.261 --> 03:42.388
"Oh, this guy, Joe Gable." "Okay, Joe,
we'll teach you how to bodyguard.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.517
Want to be a bodyguard?" "Yeah."
"This is the pay." "Let's do it."

03:45.851 --> 03:49.187
We're probably the biggest company
in the States, as far as protecting...

03:50.105 --> 03:52.649
musicians and entertainers.

03:52.816 --> 03:55.485
These guys, each one of them,
I've hand-picked.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.654
Every bodyguard that I have
right now, lined up,

03:57.738 --> 03:58.864
they were born to protect.

03:59.030 --> 04:02.950
I would build my pool of bouncers
and I'd create bodyguards out of each one.

04:03.034 --> 04:07.455
I'd say, "Get this big, get this license,
shoot this many times, train this much.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.332
We have an alliance
with American Top Team,

04:09.416 --> 04:11.877
and they would train
and we'd build them up.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.588
Then I'd try them with little artists.
"Work with this guy, here."

04:15.672 --> 04:18.007
"How'd he do?" "Good."
Then we'd put them with another one.

04:18.466 --> 04:22.887
Before you know it, now, we've got
23 bodyguards around the world, 24/7,

04:22.971 --> 04:26.183
around those names I mentioned.
My guys are living in their houses.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.602
They're with them 24 hours a day,
365 days a year, around the world.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.105
A lot of guys say,
"I bodyguarded this and that."

04:32.189 --> 04:33.356
They're all full of shit.

04:33.482 --> 04:37.151
They bodyguard a client for one night
and say, "I'm this guy's bodyguard."

04:37.235 --> 04:38.695
No, you walked him to his table.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.240
Anton was wild, man.

04:42.324 --> 04:45.494
He's like, pumped up,
Wrestlemania -type shit.

04:46.077 --> 04:49.664
With 50, confrontation was around at
any corner. You always expected it.

04:50.248 --> 04:53.877
With G-Unit and 50, these guys
are from Jamaica, Queens, New York.

04:54.127 --> 04:57.088
Where they've lived, where they're from,
murder happens every day.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.842
They're already built like this,
so I've got to think like them.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.386
It's difficult, because they said
that I'm not from the hood,

05:03.512 --> 05:06.764
I'm not from there. So, being
around them, I started learning.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.099
I started being like them.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.185
50 Cent got shot nine times,

05:11.269 --> 05:14.606
and right before he blew the fuck up
in the music scene.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.735
Don't get it twisted.
50 Cent was a gangster.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.947
Dealing with daily violence
and drama eventually led

05:23.031 --> 05:27.911
to a bullet entering the flesh
of a young Anton at extremely close range.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.913
In the hotel, it was us, Jay-Z, Missy...

05:30.997 --> 05:35.251
It was a tour, so there were
countless artists in this hotel.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.129
All I heard was yelling
and screaming outside,

05:38.713 --> 05:42.384
and then we ran to the front to check
who was yelling and screaming.

05:42.884 --> 05:46.388
Jay was the head of security at the time.
And Jay goes, "Yo, Anton,

05:46.805 --> 05:49.057
I think something's going on downstairs."

05:49.391 --> 05:52.143
Sure enough, I go out there,
there's a bunch of thugs all lined up.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.812
All I hear is jibber-jabber
going back and forth.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.190
While I'm separating it,
things are quiet,

05:57.274 --> 06:01.486
but then a shot comes around my shoulder
and cracks the main dude in the face.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.655
Now, everyone's fighting.
There's no more talking.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.867
Now, I just do what I've always done.
Fight, you know?

06:07.325 --> 06:10.704
I hear this one guy say,
"Pop the trunk", you know?

06:11.246 --> 06:14.207
I'm not from the hood,
but I know what that means.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.668
Right? So then,
I start chasing the guy.

06:16.918 --> 06:20.171
I'm not the fastest guy in the world,
and that guy was a fucking cheetah,

06:20.672 --> 06:22.590
and he was able to pop his trunk,

06:22.674 --> 06:25.843
turn around, and I just remember
him looking at me, like this,

06:25.927 --> 06:27.345
and just shoot sideways.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.431
I wasn't trying be a hero or nothing.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.141
It was just happening so fast,
that I just thought to myself,

06:32.225 --> 06:36.479
"Get that guy. Just get him,
because he's going to kill your crew."

06:36.897 --> 06:40.108
So while he's shooting,
"Bang, bang!" I'm still running after him.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.985
Then finally...
...I get hit in the leg.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.362
It still didn't register.

06:45.071 --> 06:49.700
But we were all making fun of Anton
on the bus after we found out he was cool,

06:49.784 --> 06:53.496
because he actually ran into a shoot-out,
like, a full-blown shoot-out.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.040
People from our crew,
or allegedly from our crew,

06:56.124 --> 06:58.043
somebody behind me,
would shoot back.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.754
They kept shooting back and forth.
Missy Elliot's bus got shot up.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.006
No-one was in it.

07:03.298 --> 07:06.759
Missy Elliot's tour bus was
shot the fuck up, like, Swiss cheese.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.304
And Missy Elliot is nowhere near gangster,
and she had nothing to do with it.

07:10.388 --> 07:13.642
All she does is dance every night
and "freaky, freaky, freaky".

07:14.184 --> 07:16.394
She's not really
into shoot-outs and beefs.

07:16.645 --> 07:20.398
50 comes walking in and he's like,
"Yo, man, you okay?"

07:20.690 --> 07:22.901
"I'm all right, we've just
got to get you out of here."

07:23.360 --> 07:26.446
Then he's like, "I heard what you did.
When you heal up, you come back."

07:26.696 --> 07:28.114
I was like, "You got it."

07:28.365 --> 07:31.618
You know what? Getting shot is
what it takes for them to know your name.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.213
Let's flash back
to the year 2010.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.465
Twitter was in it's infancy.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.676
Instagram had not launched.

07:47.968 --> 07:52.597
And a song called "Baby" by Justin Bieber,
hit radio stations all over the world

07:52.764 --> 07:56.768
propelling the Canadian teenager
on a path to international stardom.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.355
Bieber became one of
the world's biggest stars

08:00.605 --> 08:02.773
right as the time when
the rise of social media

08:02.857 --> 08:05.067
was changing the climate of fame,

08:05.151 --> 08:07.654
and the way fans could connect
with their favorite artists.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.491
Everywhere the young star goes,
cameras follow.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.828
At this point, Justin could be
at the tip of the North Pole

08:14.995 --> 08:17.914
and you could be damned sure
there'd be at least one girl,

08:18.039 --> 08:19.624
waiting to take a selfie with him.

08:19.916 --> 08:24.838
With this constant scrutiny and exposure,
a high-quality bodyguard is imperative.

08:25.088 --> 08:28.007
We met up with Justin's
director of security, Mikey,

08:28.091 --> 08:31.928
at the beginning of Bieber's
Global Purpose tour in Vancouver, Canada.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.390
Mikey is the epitome
of the modern bodyguard,

08:35.557 --> 08:38.726
mixing brain and brawn
to not only keep Justin safe,

08:38.809 --> 08:42.313
but ensure the moving parts
of the world tour run smoothly.

08:42.397 --> 08:43.731
My name is Mikey Arana,

08:43.815 --> 08:46.776
and I've been working for Justin Bieber
for three and a half years, now.

08:47.736 --> 08:51.364
The first time I needed security,
I used this guy named Kenny,

08:52.073 --> 08:54.659
who was actually not really
a real security guard,

08:54.743 --> 08:57.454
he was actually just a boy of mine
who was, like, large.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.332
And we figured he could scare people off
just because of the way he looked.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.919
But after a while,
I needed legitimate security.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.712
We realized
we needed security

09:06.796 --> 09:09.298
when thousands of people
starting showing up at radio stations.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.717
It was a little overwhelming.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.344
We kind of knew
that we needed to step it up.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.888
And then we went to Australia

09:15.305 --> 09:19.392
and we told the Australians
at this Sunrise TV show

09:19.726 --> 09:22.353
that we'd need more security
and they didn't believe us.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.647
Then the kids rioted the streets.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.817
I was at the place where
the crowds were starting to get bigger,

09:28.026 --> 09:32.781
and getting to the place where I felt
like my safety was at risk.

09:32.947 --> 09:36.909
So, you know, it was about time
that we started looking for people

09:36.993 --> 09:40.121
that were on that
next level of protection.

09:40.371 --> 09:44.125
You can describe Mikey as loyal,
professional, humble...

09:44.709 --> 09:45.960
"Selfless" is the best one.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.295
That's the most important adjective
when it comes to this job.

09:48.379 --> 09:52.925
Someone who's selfless, who puts others
above themselves at all times

09:53.009 --> 09:55.095
because they're making
sacrifices every day.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.889
Mikey is... He's a leader.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.934
Being a security guard,
you need to be a leader.

10:01.309 --> 10:04.562
You need to take control of situations
and understand how to communicate,

10:04.771 --> 10:06.647
and he's just the best at it.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.818
I think what we look for in security
is people who have more...

10:10.193 --> 10:12.070
More of this than more of that.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.489
You're not only protecting
someone's body,

10:15.573 --> 10:18.326
you're also protecting
their heart, their mindset.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.287
And you need someone
who can think fast on their feet,

10:21.371 --> 10:25.166
because avoiding situations is more
productive than handling the situation.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.712
The hardest part of the job
would be fighting complacency.

10:29.879 --> 10:35.009
Getting out of the routine mentality
of, "I'm just going to wake up,

10:35.093 --> 10:38.221
I'll get in the car, go to the venue,
do meet-and-greet, do the show.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.556
Just another day.

10:39.681 --> 10:43.351
Or, okay, let the fans get
a bit closer, say hi, and take a picture."

10:43.476 --> 10:48.022
Like I said earlier, nine times
out of ten, the day goes smooth.

10:48.648 --> 10:53.611
You've got to keep a combative mind
that something will happen.

10:53.903 --> 10:57.073
Not "if", but "when".
You've got to keep that mentality.

10:58.241 --> 11:00.994
The main threat? I'd say the unknown.

11:02.036 --> 11:05.165
Because nine times out of ten,

11:05.456 --> 11:09.001
the fans, girls who just want
to be with him, see him,

11:09.085 --> 11:11.379
get close with him, talk
with him, take a picture...

11:11.921 --> 11:16.009
That one time, you never know
what may happen.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.430
It's hard to get used to it.

11:20.722 --> 11:23.391
It's constantly changing,
life is constantly changing.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.643
Surroundings are constantly changing.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.355
Having people that are
consistent around all the time,

11:29.522 --> 11:33.484
with being my security, it just creates
such a safe place for me.

11:33.943 --> 11:37.614
It's needed. It's needed in this world.
It's needed for the world I'm in.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.783
You never get completely used
to it because of the emotions.

11:41.159 --> 11:44.454
You see so many people
with different stories

11:44.704 --> 11:48.124
and the stories may be alike...

11:49.083 --> 11:52.003
They always touch you in some type of way.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.840
The way I think
the security has evolved is

11:55.924 --> 11:58.259
by staying out of sight, out of mind.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.636
Giving him more space as he grows.

12:00.720 --> 12:06.142
Letting him interact more with people
as the fans have grown.

12:06.726 --> 12:12.189
They're more likely to engage him
in a conversation than to grab him

12:12.273 --> 12:14.567
and literally rip him apart.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.986
I remember, when
I first started with him...

12:17.904 --> 12:22.784
It may sound crazy, but...
Three or four little girls, emotional...

12:23.785 --> 12:27.497
They have so much strength
that they'll literally rip his shirt,

12:27.705 --> 12:28.998
take off his hoodie.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.335
And if it's a big crowd,
you can lose him in the crowd.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.213
I'd say the hardest part is just space.

12:35.588 --> 12:40.342
So, having security, it creates space
for me, creates boundaries.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.762
It creates a safe place for me.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.181
But as the fans grown with him,

12:45.556 --> 12:48.559
so has their approach. To be able
to just come up to him

12:48.643 --> 12:51.854
and be like, "Hey, Justin, how are you?"
And engage in conversation.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.564
So it gives him more space, for sure.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.609
As the fans get older and more...

12:58.486 --> 13:02.156
Just know themselves more,
they start understanding how to act

13:02.240 --> 13:04.783
and they actually want to act
a little bit more sane

13:04.867 --> 13:07.369
so that maybe they get my attention.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.789
Because at this point, with your
screaming, it's super overwhelming

13:10.873 --> 13:12.917
and it's hard for me to connect with you.

13:13.209 --> 13:18.339
The most memorable moments
are dealing with the crowds overseas,

13:18.506 --> 13:19.966
especially in South America.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.802
It gets so bad that...

13:23.928 --> 13:27.223
you start thinking,
"How am I going to get out of this?"

13:27.307 --> 13:29.392
Sometimes, when there's
large crowds, and...

13:29.642 --> 13:32.019
It's really uncontrollable,
because over time,

13:32.103 --> 13:35.105
people see other people freaking out
and they start freaking out

13:35.189 --> 13:38.985
and then it becomes this whole thing
where it just becomes uncontrollable.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.072
The strength of people
packed in one place...

13:43.906 --> 13:48.202
They can be five-foot-one girls,
but about a hundred and fifty of them?

13:48.703 --> 13:51.748
They'll move you and three other
big guys with no problem.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.250
That gave me experience,
because you start learning,

13:54.334 --> 13:57.503
or start thinking, about crowd control
before it becomes an issue.

13:57.587 --> 14:01.006
So you see one girl, and you've already
addressed that girl because you know

14:01.090 --> 14:02.925
that if you start putting the line then,

14:03.384 --> 14:06.220
you start creating a system for them

14:06.304 --> 14:09.974
so you there's not an issue with them
afterwards when there's a hundred of them.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.608
Yeah, I would say
me and Justin are friends.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.653
We definitely developed
a special relationship.

14:22.945 --> 14:26.824
He's always been good, a friend,
someone I can count on.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.326
And that's important, as well.

14:29.077 --> 14:33.581
I think just because of the fact
of how I get to see him every day

14:34.248 --> 14:38.460
and respect what he goes through
and vice versa,

14:38.544 --> 14:42.548
he sees what I go through
and has that respect towards me and...

14:43.383 --> 14:45.593
Yeah, great relationship.

14:46.260 --> 14:50.014
After a while, you build relationships
with the people that are around you,

14:50.431 --> 14:51.557
even venue security.

14:51.641 --> 14:54.102
You see them so much
and you build a rapport with them.

14:54.519 --> 14:57.563
The thing that could also go
with the hardest parts of the job

14:57.647 --> 15:02.443
is to be able to maintain
the client and friend relationship.

15:02.652 --> 15:08.408
Knowing when to step in as a mentor,
as a person who you...

15:09.117 --> 15:12.120
you know, grow emotions to,

15:12.703 --> 15:17.041
and when to just shut up
and be an employee.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.919
You want someone
who cares about the artist.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.880
They prefer to remain professional,

15:22.964 --> 15:24.965
because that's a true pro,
someone who can really

15:25.049 --> 15:27.802
put their ass on the line for somebody,
but at the same time,

15:28.136 --> 15:31.264
knows how to walk that very grey area.

15:32.557 --> 15:37.061
People get caught up in it, sometimes,
and other times they're not caring enough.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.564
Finding that nice mix of someone
who really understands a person,

15:40.648 --> 15:43.609
gives a shit, but at the same time
can stay professional.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.236
When you find it, you know.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.753
James "Whitey" Bulger.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.424
One of the most notorious
American criminals of all time.

16:07.383 --> 16:12.263
Whitey and his Winter Hill Gang
ran the streets of Boston for decades.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.391
Bulger was a violent, vicious gangster,

16:15.516 --> 16:18.227
but it's not the murder,
extortion and narcotics sales

16:18.311 --> 16:20.730
that make Whitey's story special. No.

16:21.105 --> 16:25.735
It's the fact that he was secretly
an FBI informant for over two decades.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.029
What's this got to do with our story?

16:28.446 --> 16:33.117
Well, powerful criminals surround
themselves with powerful associates.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.288
Whitey ran with a small inner circle.
Two, to be exact.

16:37.555 --> 16:40.666
One of these allies was his partner,
Stevie Flemmi,

16:40.750 --> 16:43.669
another ruthless killer
and fellow FBI informant.

16:44.212 --> 16:48.883
The other was Whitey's right hand man,
bodyguard and enforcer, Kevin Weeks.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.553
Kevin worked alongside Whitey
for over 25 years.

16:52.720 --> 16:56.765
Nobody was closer to him and nobody
was more shocked and betrayed

16:56.849 --> 16:59.977
when Whitey was exposed
as an FBI informant.

17:00.978 --> 17:04.440
Kevin's story is one of crime,
corruption, violence,

17:04.523 --> 17:07.734
betrayal, and of course, lots of death.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.654
Whitey Bulger was probably

17:10.738 --> 17:13.490
the premier criminal in Boston
for almost thirty years.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.200
In terms of describing Bulger,

17:15.284 --> 17:19.163
I think the adjectives of "vicious"
and "cold-blooded" would apply.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.705
Highly Intelligent.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.958
Amoral.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.917
Very, very disciplined.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.087
Ruthless.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.590
Not someone I'd want to be
spending a lot of time with.

17:29.674 --> 17:32.176
A clever and vicious criminal.

17:33.219 --> 17:37.390
If you asked me years ago to describe
Whitey Bulger, I'd say he was a friend.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.559
I really looked up to the guy.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.477
Mentor. He taught me a lot.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.606
If you asked me today,
I would tell you I have mixed feelings.

17:46.357 --> 17:48.984
Because I considered him my best friend
and then I found out

17:49.068 --> 17:52.321
that him and Steve Flemmi
were informants for the FBI.

17:52.446 --> 17:56.325
He was one of these people
that lead from the front.

17:57.368 --> 18:01.038
He enjoyed it when it came to
violence and stuff. He enjoyed it.

18:01.122 --> 18:03.958
He wouldn't ask you to do anything
that he wouldn't do himself,

18:04.125 --> 18:05.293
which was everything.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.045
So, when he asked us
to do something, myself,

18:08.129 --> 18:10.590
yeah, I didn't hesitate,
because I knew he would do it.

18:11.340 --> 18:15.386
He was absolutely devoted to Bulger.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.806
He talked about him as being

18:19.348 --> 18:23.769
clever, brilliant, a master manipulator.

18:24.562 --> 18:27.189
He talks about him as if he was flawless,

18:27.481 --> 18:29.150
like he was a criminal god.

18:30.568 --> 18:35.531
When I was 18 years old, out of school,
I started working clubs, bouncing.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.034
I worked St. Patrick's Day, there,

18:38.200 --> 18:40.786
and I had a few fights
and ended up getting hired.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.039
And that's when I met
Jim Bulger and Steve Flemmi.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.499
They used to frequent the bar.

18:45.875 --> 18:49.962
Eventually, he gets picked up as a bouncer

18:50.212 --> 18:54.383
at a bucket of blood called Triple O's.
Triple O's happens to be where

18:54.467 --> 18:58.178
Whitey Bulger conducted
business, upstairs.

18:58.262 --> 19:01.015
You never wanted to be called
upstairs by Whitey Bulger.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.100
He takes him on as a lieutenant.

19:03.184 --> 19:04.226
He's beef.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.894
Whether he's a bodyguard

19:05.978 --> 19:08.314
in the conventional sense or not
is one thing.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.858
He's beef and muscle.

19:12.443 --> 19:15.363
He's there,
he is there for the worst of it.

19:15.613 --> 19:20.951
He's an eyewitness to some of the most
gruesome murders you can imagine.

19:26.749 --> 19:29.377
I got along
with Jim Bulger great and I trusted him.

19:29.627 --> 19:31.545
Basically, I kind of knew
what he was thinking.

19:32.505 --> 19:37.343
Well, there was a fellow, Brian Halloran,
and he was an associate of Winter Hill.

19:38.135 --> 19:42.932
He was involved in a shooting in Chinatown
where he killed this guy, George Pappas.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.518
And he was grabbed by the FBI

19:45.726 --> 19:47.812
and he co-operated,
he made a deal with them.

19:48.229 --> 19:50.814
His deal was to give up Whitey and Stevie

19:50.898 --> 19:53.025
and other people
for two different murders.

19:53.192 --> 19:58.656
If Halloran had given up Bulger,
as he was trying to do to the FBI,

19:59.657 --> 20:04.078
then Bulger was in trouble
and Bulger's empire was about to fall.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.247
Whitey was looking for
Halloran for a while,

20:06.372 --> 20:09.417
and we finally received word
that he was down at the waterfront.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.503
That he was at this restaurant.
It was called the "Pier" at the time.

20:12.837 --> 20:16.424
Weeks was sent out as the lookout.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.511
They had a name for Halloran.
They called him "Balloon Head".

20:21.345 --> 20:24.848
So, he was going to notify them.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.683
He was posted across the bar,

20:26.767 --> 20:29.019
and at the right time
he was gonna call Bulger.

20:29.103 --> 20:31.814
I was using the binoculars
and saw Halloran in the window.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.359
Jim Bulger was in the hit car
with another fellow,

20:35.735 --> 20:38.236
and I radioed to him
when Halloran was getting up.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.907
And when Halloran came out into the air,
I let him know that he was out.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.575
He got shot right over here.

20:43.659 --> 20:48.289
The car drifted across the street.
The driver was killed immediately,

20:48.873 --> 20:52.751
he was shot in the head.
And Brian Halloran got out of the car,

20:52.835 --> 20:56.714
he staggered towards the back
and he got shot 21 times.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.051
That was the first time I had been
involved a murder with them,

21:01.135 --> 21:02.970
and it was a double homicide.

21:05.473 --> 21:08.266
When the murder took place,
my first murder,

21:08.350 --> 21:10.060
it was kind of surreal.

21:10.352 --> 21:13.481
I came to the realization
that this really does happen.

21:13.898 --> 21:17.609
So I decided, at the time,
that I had committed homicide.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.028
I was involved with it.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.279
There was no getting out.
And at that point, I said,

21:21.363 --> 21:24.283
"If I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna be the best I can at it."

21:29.121 --> 21:32.916
In North America, the term
"bodyguard" immediately invokes a vision

21:33.000 --> 21:36.796
of somebody protecting
a musician, an actor, an athlete.

21:37.296 --> 21:41.550
However, executive protection
is much more than that.

21:42.259 --> 21:45.721
Enter the Shadow Group and Atlas Tactical.

21:46.305 --> 21:50.726
High risk targets,
24/7 life-or-death possibilities.

21:53.979 --> 21:58.150
Welcome to an undisclosed location
in Florida where Shamir Bolivar,

21:58.234 --> 21:59.693
owner of the Shadow Group,

21:59.777 --> 22:04.489
combines skills with Tairon Coronel,
owner and operator of Atlas Tactical

22:04.573 --> 22:08.494
a company that specializes
in overseas diplomatic protection.

22:09.370 --> 22:12.414
War zone protection
is a whole other world of security.

22:12.623 --> 22:15.459
Operating in the most dangerous
countries on the planet,

22:15.793 --> 22:18.879
these guys have experience
in situations where the enemy

22:18.963 --> 22:20.548
isn't some overzealous fan,

22:20.756 --> 22:23.717
but a demented motherfucker
willing to die for a cause.

22:26.428 --> 22:30.474
My name is Tairon Coronel.
Married, 36 years old, father of one.

22:31.100 --> 22:34.937
I'm originally from Cartagena, Colombia.
So, I was born and raised there.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.274
Grew up really poor.
No water, no electricity,

22:38.607 --> 22:41.569
You know, no bathroom,
just a latrine outside.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.697
In Colombia, I was going
to military school in my later years

22:44.905 --> 22:46.615
so I always wanted
to be in the military.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.243
After the attacks on 9/11,

22:49.910 --> 22:52.871
I decided that I needed to do something
for this great country

22:52.955 --> 22:56.041
that has given me so much,
so I joined the Marine Corps.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.168
I went to the recruiter, signed up,

22:58.252 --> 23:00.921
a couple of weeks later I was
at Parris Island, South Carolina

23:01.005 --> 23:02.339
to start boot camp.

23:03.090 --> 23:06.844
My name is Shamir Bolivar.
Forty years old, father of three.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.264
Originally from Brooklyn, New York.
Grew up in the inner city.

23:11.348 --> 23:14.977
I've protected and been
associated with anything

23:15.477 --> 23:17.521
from former President George Bush,
President Obama,

23:17.897 --> 23:21.442
Donald Trump, Lenny Kravitz,
the Wade family...

23:22.026 --> 23:25.863
Growing up in this city,
I was forced to ride the line.

23:25.988 --> 23:29.741
There's a fine line
between being on the good guy's side

23:29.825 --> 23:32.870
or the bad guy's side, I was just
surrounded by a bunch of chaos.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.250
I knew I'd go to war,
I just didn't know how soon.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.587
My military specialty is 0311,
which is infantry.

23:41.962 --> 23:46.550
So I did that, I deployed to Iraq in 2003.
We were in Kuwait about a month

23:46.634 --> 23:49.803
before we crossed
the land of departure into Iraq.

23:49.929 --> 23:54.140
Every little city, little town,
all the way from Kuwait to Baghdad...

23:54.224 --> 23:57.227
It was just a fire fight.
Dead bodies all over the place.

23:57.937 --> 24:02.399
Burning oil fields, mangled bodies.
The smell was pretty bad.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.442
A lot of it was full of bullet holes.

24:04.526 --> 24:07.863
The dogs would eat
the dead bodies all over the place.

24:08.155 --> 24:09.823
We finally got to a camp in Iraq.

24:09.907 --> 24:12.701
The first day we got to that camp,
we took 43 mortar rounds,

24:12.785 --> 24:14.078
so that was pretty scary.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.373
At that point, I hadn't seen
any of my buddies get hurt,

24:18.457 --> 24:20.876
but that would come pretty soon.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.173
I lost a lot of friends.

24:26.340 --> 24:29.677
Half of my team was killed
January 31st, 2005.

24:30.511 --> 24:34.264
So, I went over there with a team of four
and only two of us came back.

24:34.682 --> 24:36.725
Just one of those things
that happens in war.

24:37.518 --> 24:40.854
We're volunteers,
we were not made to go to war.

24:40.938 --> 24:46.110
We obviously have to understand
that the war... War is not pretty.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.946
But, you know, it is what it is.

24:51.782 --> 24:54.576
I focused on law enforcement
as a career, and got into it

24:54.660 --> 24:57.621
after moving down here from New York.

24:58.205 --> 25:00.457
I was in law enforcement
for approximately 15 years.

25:01.875 --> 25:05.420
In law enforcement, I was able to work
several specialized units.

25:05.504 --> 25:09.883
Narcotics, working undercover,
SWAT officer, work as an operator.

25:10.426 --> 25:13.094
I worked containment.
Specialized operations

25:13.178 --> 25:16.682
where we took down narcotic organizations.

25:16.932 --> 25:20.269
It was like my first venture
into the Miami Vice life.

25:20.561 --> 25:24.481
Time doing dignitary protection
as a SWAT officer,

25:24.565 --> 25:26.900
as a patrol officer.

25:27.776 --> 25:30.403
Presidential motorcade would come through,
we'd help Secret Service out.

25:30.487 --> 25:31.822
I was like, "You know what?

25:33.157 --> 25:37.036
There's some money in this.
This is a very profitable business.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.871
I'm just on the wrong side of it."

25:39.621 --> 25:41.665
We used to ride around Baghdad
with a Humvee,

25:41.749 --> 25:44.126
no doors, no top, it was just... Whatever.

25:44.501 --> 25:47.838
On our second deployment,
they started putting IEDs.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.010
Oh, shit!

26:02.478 --> 26:06.231
So, most of our casualties came
from improvised explosive devices.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.150
You know, you're driving around,

26:08.442 --> 26:10.568
all of a sudden,
you drive over a pressure plate

26:10.652 --> 26:12.029
and your vehicle blows up.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.698
Seeing a vehicle in front of you

26:14.782 --> 26:18.994
completely get turned into
Swiss cheese was an experience

26:19.119 --> 26:21.830
I hope I never have to live, again.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.416
My body has definitely taken a toll.

26:24.875 --> 26:28.087
Half of my left index finger is missing,
if you can see that.

26:29.588 --> 26:33.092
Both of my clavicles are
two and a half centimeters shorter.

26:33.383 --> 26:35.802
My bicep got detached from here
and ended up down here.

26:35.886 --> 26:37.262
It looked like an apple in there.

26:37.471 --> 26:42.559
IEDs overseas are definitely the biggest
killer of U.S. troops and contractors.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.229
Diplomatic protection
in Afghanistan during war

26:46.313 --> 26:48.065
is as dangerous as it gets.

26:48.690 --> 26:51.818
Tairon came face-to-face
with a life or death situation

26:51.902 --> 26:54.696
after his vehicle convoy
spun out and crashed.

26:54.822 --> 26:57.032
I got out and went to assess
the situation

26:57.116 --> 27:00.494
and as I opened the back door,
I saw a lady with a broken leg.

27:00.702 --> 27:03.747
As I'm pulling her out, you know,
a lot of people were gathering.

27:03.831 --> 27:06.667
Then, after, I felt somebody
pulling my gun.

27:07.251 --> 27:09.002
So I looked, took a peek back,

27:09.086 --> 27:13.048
and I saw some dude
with his hand out for my pistol.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.093
At that time, I turned around
and put two rounds in him

27:16.385 --> 27:19.513
right above his stomach
and another one on his chest.

27:19.847 --> 27:22.307
It's one of those situations
where you feel bad for the people

27:22.391 --> 27:25.894
but at the same time,
it's either them or us.

27:26.228 --> 27:27.980
I have to come home to my family.

27:28.605 --> 27:31.024
I got to do
what I got to do to stay alive.

27:33.068 --> 27:36.738
After I got out of the Marine Corps,
I didn't even know what I wanted to do.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.865
I got a call from a company
called Blackwater,

27:38.949 --> 27:40.659
I'm not sure if you heard about it.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.704
Yeah, that Blackwater.

27:44.371 --> 27:47.916
The notorious security firm
founded by auto manufacturing heir

27:48.000 --> 27:50.169
and ex-navy man, Eric Prince.

27:50.586 --> 27:54.590
Tasked with high-risk security detail
in conflict areas around the world.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.760
Blackwater became
a household name in 2004

27:59.011 --> 28:02.806
after four members were ambushed
in Fallujah by Iraqi insurgents

28:02.890 --> 28:04.975
who fatally shot all four agents.

28:05.809 --> 28:09.062
After the killing,
a mob lit the bodies on fire

28:09.146 --> 28:10.563
and then dragged the charred remains

28:10.647 --> 28:12.608
through the streets of Iraq
behind a vehicle,

28:13.025 --> 28:14.818
beating them with sticks as they went.

28:15.485 --> 28:17.654
Finally, the remains were
hung from a bridge

28:17.738 --> 28:20.824
while men, women and children cheered.

28:20.908 --> 28:24.036
The chilling events sent shockwaves
through American news media,

28:24.244 --> 28:26.622
significantly escalating the war in Iraq.

28:27.247 --> 28:30.875
Blackwater received over
1.5 billion dollars' worth of contracts

28:30.959 --> 28:33.253
during the Iraq War
from the US government,

28:33.587 --> 28:36.173
but these contracts did not come
without controversy.

28:36.340 --> 28:39.384
Between 2005 and 2007,

28:39.593 --> 28:42.846
Blackwater was involved
in 195 shooting incidents.

28:43.263 --> 28:46.266
Negative press became associated
with Blackwater's brash way

28:46.350 --> 28:50.395
of doing business,
peaking on September 16th, 2007

28:50.646 --> 28:52.605
when a team opened fire
on a group of people

28:52.689 --> 28:57.194
at Nisour Square in Baghdad,
killing 17, injuring 20.

28:57.778 --> 29:00.655
The Blackwater guards explained
that the group was ambushed

29:00.739 --> 29:02.908
and the shooting
was an act of self-defense,

29:03.367 --> 29:05.994
but the United States Federal Court
decided otherwise,

29:06.370 --> 29:10.374
sentencing the three men to 30 years
in jail and one man to a life in prison.

29:12.459 --> 29:16.129
You know, we have a bad rap
for some incidents that happened,

29:16.338 --> 29:18.923
but I can tell you that Blackwater
is the only company

29:19.007 --> 29:22.678
doing security overseas
that has a 100 percent record.

29:23.095 --> 29:27.766
You know, we have never lost a client,
ever, but nobody talks about that.

29:28.183 --> 29:29.976
When I was at Blackwater,
I was on two teams.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.312
I was on a team called "TST",
Tactical Support Team.

29:32.813 --> 29:36.483
If they couldn't make it back
for themselves, we had to go and get them.

29:36.795 --> 29:38.902
The other teams I was in
I was with the Ambassador.

29:39.236 --> 29:41.738
So, wherever he went,
I went right next to him.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.198
Whatever the mission.

29:43.532 --> 29:46.576
A lot of people think that
contractors are just out to kill people,

29:46.660 --> 29:47.619
well, we're not.

29:47.703 --> 29:53.292
We get paid to care of whoever
and bring them back safe.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.877
We're not there
to get into a fire fight with somebody,

29:55.961 --> 29:58.963
we're there to have one person
from point A to point B

29:59.047 --> 30:00.299
and then back to point A.

30:08.807 --> 30:12.853
South Africa,
a breathtakingly beautiful country,

30:13.603 --> 30:15.314
filled with a tumultuous history.

30:15.981 --> 30:20.193
For decades, the nation lived
in complete racial inequality,

30:20.402 --> 30:22.571
lead by the all-white
apartheid government.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.574
Violence and bloodshed were rampant.

30:26.199 --> 30:28.910
The country was drowning
on the brink of Civil War

30:28.994 --> 30:30.537
and in desperate need of change.

30:31.496 --> 30:35.292
When change finally came,
a national hero was born.

30:36.209 --> 30:37.419
Nelson Mandela,

30:38.170 --> 30:41.673
arguably the most popular
global politician of all time.

30:42.049 --> 30:44.676
Mandela devoted his entire life

30:44.760 --> 30:47.846
to fighting for equality
and democracy in South Africa.

30:48.180 --> 30:51.307
Including spending
27 years behind bars

30:51.391 --> 30:55.020
after narrowly avoiding a death sentence
via hanging for treason.

30:55.562 --> 31:00.359
Following his 1994 inauguration
as South Africa's first elected president,

31:00.817 --> 31:04.404
Mandela immediately set out
to change the fiber of the country.

31:05.197 --> 31:08.116
Mandela commenced the change
first within his office,

31:08.617 --> 31:11.953
merging the previous all-white
presidential protection unit

31:12.037 --> 31:15.332
with his all-black ANC
presidential bodyguards.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.377
This is where our story begins.

31:20.003 --> 31:24.173
Rory Steyn, presidential team lead
and longtime fixture

31:24.257 --> 31:26.676
of the racially motivated
apartheid police,

31:26.760 --> 31:29.554
was forced to work along
Mandela's head bodyguard

31:29.638 --> 31:32.599
of four years, Jason Tshabalala.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.643
Jason was a trained ANC rebel

31:35.727 --> 31:38.604
who viciously fought the old,
all-white government,

31:38.688 --> 31:40.899
and men just like Rory Steyn.

31:41.817 --> 31:45.654
What transpired helped build
the foundation of an entire nation.

31:47.447 --> 31:50.950
Growing up in South Africa,
when I was born in 1963,

31:51.034 --> 31:54.121
was completely different
to what South Africa is today.

31:54.287 --> 31:56.372
Apartheid had had 15 years
to establish itself

31:56.456 --> 31:57.707
by the time I was born,

31:57.791 --> 32:00.001
so when I was born,
everything was segregated.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.920
I went to whites only schools,

32:02.170 --> 32:04.922
only saw other white families
and other white kids

32:05.006 --> 32:07.426
other than, of course,
our domestic workers

32:08.343 --> 32:09.677
when they brought their children home.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.638
We would play with these black kids,
but when we came to school,

32:12.722 --> 32:14.975
they would go to that school
and we would go to that school.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.269
I finished high school in '81.

32:17.936 --> 32:23.191
At that time, it was mandatory
for every white male leaving school,

32:23.525 --> 32:25.526
to do two years of national service

32:25.610 --> 32:29.531
in the South African Defense Force,
as it was, which meant the army.

32:29.990 --> 32:32.867
I really didn't want to go to the army
if I could've avoided it,

32:32.951 --> 32:35.495
so I had opted to go
into the police force.

32:36.580 --> 32:41.626
If you fast forward that movie to 1990
when the then State President de Klerk

32:42.127 --> 32:43.753
announced that he was going
to un-ban the ANC,

32:43.879 --> 32:47.048
release Mr. Mandela unconditionally
and all of that,

32:47.132 --> 32:49.092
I was in the security branch.

32:49.885 --> 32:53.763
The special branch at that time
was like a Gestapo, basically.

32:53.930 --> 32:57.642
The special branch was really tasked
to keeping apartheid alive

32:57.934 --> 33:00.061
for lack of a better explanation,

33:00.145 --> 33:02.730
because they would be considered
the number one enemy.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.817
It would be unlikely to accommodate
them in your new government.

33:06.234 --> 33:11.448
The most brutal unit
that you can ever have at that time.

33:13.116 --> 33:17.287
If you are arrested by the special branch,
you can disappear.

33:17.537 --> 33:21.791
It was the hardcore side
of the apartheid police force.

33:22.125 --> 33:25.044
We went to Madiba and told him,
you know,

33:25.128 --> 33:28.798
Rory is one of the guys
that was in the special branch

33:29.382 --> 33:35.305
and he was allegedly involved
in bombing Khotso House.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.766
"He has been attached to us.
How can we work with this guy?"

33:38.433 --> 33:40.685
Having received my training in the police

33:40.769 --> 33:44.731
and, in particular, in the special branch,
or the security branch,

33:45.273 --> 33:50.320
we were trained in the ideology
and strategy of the ANC,

33:50.946 --> 33:52.488
I didn't buy into the stuff

33:52.572 --> 33:54.657
he was saying when he was
released from prison

33:54.741 --> 33:57.660
about South Africa being for all people,
both black and white,

33:57.744 --> 34:00.497
and we want to build one country,
and all of that.

34:00.830 --> 34:03.625
I have come out with one single objective,

34:04.501 --> 34:08.922
and that is to help and to bring
South Africans together, black and white.

34:10.172 --> 34:13.927
The fact that Nelson Mandela
gave people the opportunity to change

34:14.386 --> 34:17.638
I think it was very much
part of his character

34:17.722 --> 34:20.056
that he gave a person that opportunity

34:20.141 --> 34:23.186
and he was willing to take that risk
in his most inner circle,

34:23.520 --> 34:27.649
to allow someone like Rory Steyn to say,
"You've got the opportunity to change."

34:27.815 --> 34:30.025
We were taught that in those days

34:30.150 --> 34:34.697
that the sole idea of the ANC
as a liberation movement was to just...

34:35.364 --> 34:40.661
sweep all of properly-thinking,
like-minded white people into the sea

34:40.954 --> 34:42.289
and take over the country.

34:42.956 --> 34:45.542
As it turns out,
I couldn't have been more wrong.

34:47.127 --> 34:50.880
Come 1994, when we now
have a new president,

34:51.422 --> 34:54.842
who insisted, by the way, that his staff,

34:55.510 --> 35:00.640
and even his protection team must reflect
the demographic of all of South Africa...

35:00.890 --> 35:03.310
It was very difficult.
It was difficult for us,

35:03.602 --> 35:07.688
because we were the cops that used
to protect the previously all-white

35:07.772 --> 35:13.569
government leaders and we are,
by dint of our constitution,

35:13.653 --> 35:15.614
required to protect our head of state.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.112
Now we've got a new head of state

35:17.237 --> 35:19.701
who comes with his own
security detail, quite rightly.

35:20.368 --> 35:22.370
I mean, they're never gonna hand
their president over

35:22.454 --> 35:25.123
to a bunch of white guys
who were previously their enemies.

35:25.373 --> 35:29.544
I didn't think it was going to be
a perfect relationship from the outset

35:29.878 --> 35:32.213
because of our historical backgrounds,

35:32.631 --> 35:34.674
that different worlds
we were coming from,

35:34.883 --> 35:36.968
the culture we were coming from.

35:37.469 --> 35:41.014
As you can understand,
security is about trust.

35:41.848 --> 35:45.268
Believing in each other, you know,
that we'll cover each other's back.

35:46.895 --> 35:50.856
But for us, it was difficult,
because some of these guys

35:50.940 --> 35:56.738
that we were supposed to work with,
they were the ones who were arresting us.

35:56.863 --> 36:01.326
Who were supporting
the brutal system of apartheid.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.995
And we were asking ourselves,
"How do we work with these guys?

36:04.079 --> 36:05.163
Do we trust them?"

36:05.830 --> 36:09.166
That guy who was formerly my enemy
as a security branch copper...

36:09.250 --> 36:12.879
I was hunting those guys
who we considered to be terrorists,

36:13.213 --> 36:14.714
and they're now my colleagues.

36:14.964 --> 36:19.469
The only way I could learn to trust him
as my colleague is to work with him,

36:19.719 --> 36:20.887
to hurt with him...

36:21.221 --> 36:23.806
It takes time. Trust.
Building trust takes time.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.225
There's no shortcut to that.

36:25.642 --> 36:28.103
We're here for a job,
we're not here to be friends.

36:28.853 --> 36:33.191
We're here to make sure that we conduct
our duties as professionals.

36:34.484 --> 36:36.111
Over a period of time...

36:37.737 --> 36:42.909
the relationship obviously grew
closer and closer.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.953
To see them amalgamating
and working together,

36:46.037 --> 36:48.414
in the beginning,
was quite entertaining, actually.

36:48.498 --> 36:52.252
They used to group themselves
in different offices.

36:52.419 --> 36:56.214
And later on, of course,
they started socializing together, even.

36:56.506 --> 36:59.091
Then they realized that we have
to pull this off as a team.

36:59.175 --> 37:00.969
There are no individuals, here.

37:01.136 --> 37:03.596
We actually had two teams.

37:03.847 --> 37:07.100
We had the main team and the other team.

37:07.851 --> 37:10.978
And Madiba said to us,
he called a meeting to say,

37:11.062 --> 37:17.193
"Look, I want you to work
with all South Africans.

37:18.778 --> 37:22.741
Because I work with all
South Africans, black and white."

37:30.290 --> 37:33.001
And it was difficult for us, initially.

37:34.919 --> 37:41.176
But we understood, as individuals,
that we've got an obligation...

37:42.594 --> 37:43.928
to build a nation.

37:45.680 --> 37:51.478
And we needed to work
with other South Africans.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.670
Headquartered
in Miami, Florida,

38:17.754 --> 38:20.297
Guardian Protection works major festivals

38:20.381 --> 38:24.886
and concerts with their personal
bodyguard service and venue security.

38:25.303 --> 38:30.266
During massive festival weekends,
Anton's bodyguards often find themselves

38:30.350 --> 38:34.395
at the same venues where Guardian's
events security division is running point.

38:34.771 --> 38:39.233
Anton and his team had an action-packed
Memorial Day weekend, where their clients

38:39.317 --> 38:45.323
T-Pain, DJ Khaled, Ace Hood,
Keri Hilson and more, all had concerts.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.827
I want to cover Best of the Best.

38:49.911 --> 38:52.288
That's the big event.
It's two days, this year.

38:52.372 --> 38:56.000
Every time, every year it's Sunday, but
now they're doing it Sunday and Saturday.

38:56.084 --> 38:59.128
Saturday's gonna be hip-hop, mostly,

38:59.212 --> 39:03.049
then Sunday's gonna be
a more Caribbean crowd.

39:03.216 --> 39:07.470
So, expect a bigger crowd, Saturday,
expect a rougher crowd, Saturday.

39:08.096 --> 39:10.931
Expect more bullshit, Saturday.
But Sunday, you guys already know,

39:11.015 --> 39:13.225
how the Caribbean crowds are.
You respect them, they respect you.

39:13.309 --> 39:16.563
The only problem you're gonna
have is weed. No-one's really gonna fight.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.650
You know, knock on wood, but I mean,
the big concern I have is for Saturday.

39:23.027 --> 39:26.364
We've got some new guys on the crew
that me and Josh interviewed.

39:26.614 --> 39:30.785
I want to test the guy out.
This is also Frank's new one-time venture,

39:30.869 --> 39:32.704
leaving the nest.
We've got to see how he's doing.

39:32.954 --> 39:34.830
This is your first time being requested,
which is awesome.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.665
Ace is performing at Best of the Best.

39:36.749 --> 39:38.960
If it was any other artist,
I wouldn't worry about it,

39:39.252 --> 39:42.505
but I've seen him perform.
You're gonna get tried for being white,

39:42.839 --> 39:44.048
for being a bodyguard.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.759
I'll get tried for telling them
to do something they don't want to.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.721
You've got a temper.
You'll have to curb it, fast.

39:49.888 --> 39:53.016
You've got to be a bodyguarding
on the worst week you could ask for.

39:53.266 --> 39:56.268
Last time I worked with him, there were
eight of us, so it was a lot easier.

39:56.352 --> 39:59.438
But now, he's solely responsible
for his client's protection.

39:59.522 --> 40:03.108
Everything good and bad
that happens is because of him.

40:03.192 --> 40:04.235
We'll see how he does.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.033
I hire guards that go through the bullshit

40:11.117 --> 40:13.661
of getting yelled at by some guy
that you know you'll squash

40:13.745 --> 40:14.913
but you've got to eat it.

40:15.163 --> 40:17.164
- Are your feelings gonna get hurt?
- Absolutely not.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.292
- We're throwing you in the fire, tonight.
- Yes, sir.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.894
- I paid 150 dollars for this, bro.
- I don't book this.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.896
First of all, I'm a cop.
You'd better back up.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.774
- Listen to me.
- I'm a police officer, back up.

41:25.024 --> 41:28.403
Back up. I'm on duty.
Back the fuck up.

41:31.864 --> 41:34.033
It gets a little cluttered
with the Caribbean crowd

41:34.117 --> 41:36.827
and with a hip hop crowd.
The stages are always cluttered.

41:36.911 --> 41:40.999
They do an okay job, but it's never clean.
You're never gonna walk on a clean stage.

41:42.375 --> 41:45.002
This is where it's gonna happen.
We're gonna see an issue here.

41:45.086 --> 41:47.671
People with VIP bands
should not be going backstage.

41:47.755 --> 41:51.258
Everybody's somebody, especially in Miami,
especially in Caribbean or hip hop crowds.

41:51.342 --> 41:55.429
It's simple. No bracelet, you're not in.
It's chaos, and we're here to organize it.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.932
- I've got to deal with this shit--
- What are you talking about?

41:58.016 --> 42:00.727
What the last twenty people have
been talking about. The bracelets.

42:04.689 --> 42:07.775
Hey, get the fuck off me, man.
Get the fuck off me!

42:21.080 --> 42:24.751
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.796
That covers Best of the Best.
Code blues the number one thing

42:28.880 --> 42:32.759
and people trying to escort people in
without bracelets are number two.

42:32.967 --> 42:35.386
You've got to get out of here.
You've got to go downstairs.

42:35.678 --> 42:37.137
I'm not trying to chase you down.

42:37.221 --> 42:40.433
- I can say no in three languages.
- That's understandable.

42:40.725 --> 42:43.770
You want to follow me around?
We can walk and talk, all right.

42:44.187 --> 42:45.563
I guess this is a date, now.

42:46.439 --> 42:49.149
You're always one ass-whooping
away from being fired.

42:49.233 --> 42:50.776
Nine years
as a pro football player

42:50.860 --> 42:52.528
and head of security for Keri Hilson.

42:52.612 --> 42:55.698
I've been with her, now,
for two years, so we have a relationship.

42:55.782 --> 42:58.701
Sometimes she tells me, "Harvey,
I think you were rough with that fan."

43:00.536 --> 43:02.621
Oh, my god!

43:02.705 --> 43:03.998
Yo, yo, yo...

43:04.373 --> 43:06.917
At the end of the day,
if you've got to your show, safe,

43:07.001 --> 43:11.422
you've got on stage, safe, and went back
to your hotel, safe, I did my job.

43:22.558 --> 43:25.353
Mikey has flourished
as Bieber's director of security

43:25.520 --> 43:27.605
because he has been
able to keep Justin safe

43:27.939 --> 43:31.484
while simultaneously dealing
with a variety of logistical executions

43:31.734 --> 43:34.112
that ensure Team Bieber runs smoothly.

43:34.403 --> 43:35.738
We join Mikey and Justin

43:35.822 --> 43:39.408
for an inside look at the day-to-day
workings of a world tour.

43:41.369 --> 43:43.245
We took him up
through the underground,

43:43.329 --> 43:44.663
so the crowd doesn't notice.

43:44.747 --> 43:48.501
They're still standing there,
thinking that he's still here.

43:48.668 --> 43:51.086
Cars and buses are there,
all the hype is here,

43:51.170 --> 43:53.422
so he goes underground
and out the other side.

43:53.756 --> 43:56.759
I'm on a group chat right now
with six people,

43:56.926 --> 43:58.177
coordinating where they are.

43:58.928 --> 44:01.055
Chiropractor, trainers...

44:01.514 --> 44:04.767
Yeah, he could ask for one at any time.
So if he asks, "Where's the chiro?",

44:04.851 --> 44:06.352
everybody has to be together.

44:06.477 --> 44:07.644
Hurry up and wait.

44:07.728 --> 44:10.940
Don't forget to take your belongings
that you'll need for him.

44:11.107 --> 44:15.444
A masseuse, her table,
the trainer, his protein and...

44:15.736 --> 44:21.241
He said he wants a chiro and a masseuse
to meet him at the venue.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.828
It's like, "Alright, that's
what I'm already working on."

44:24.996 --> 44:27.790
Before he even asks,
I'm already setting it up

44:28.166 --> 44:30.877
because it's like, "I already know
what you're gonna ask."

44:31.127 --> 44:33.379
- That's three and a half years.
- Yeah, yeah.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.715
It's like, "He's gonna
want this, this and that."

44:36.007 --> 44:39.093
Then you get a text. "He wants this,
this and that. Okay, already got it."

44:39.677 --> 44:43.430
That's another thing we do,
if it's one of us getting out,

44:43.514 --> 44:46.601
to go to the gym or something,
the paparazzi will come too.

44:46.976 --> 44:49.436
We'll stop, open the doors
and say, "Look, he's not here.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.564
Check, all right?
Stop following. Thank you."

44:52.398 --> 44:54.942
This is not George Clooney,
this is not so-and-so.

44:55.693 --> 45:00.948
You've got young girls between
a certain age and hardcore loyals.

45:01.032 --> 45:04.827
- Guys here, too.
- Yeah, that's been a trend, too.

45:04.911 --> 45:06.329
A lot of guys, you can see.

45:08.623 --> 45:11.542
Yeah, so right now,
since he's already there,

45:12.293 --> 45:16.380
we'll just basically do a walkthrough.
Learn what the location of everything is,

45:16.505 --> 45:18.674
from the dressing room to the catering,

45:19.258 --> 45:21.928
eventually the meet-and-greet,
where it's gonna take place,

45:22.178 --> 45:24.013
how they've got that organized.

45:24.972 --> 45:28.100
Got to make sure it works
with crowd control.

45:30.603 --> 45:32.104
It's just to get to know the venue.

45:32.980 --> 45:37.193
See where our car is gonna be staged at.
Where the bus is gonna be.

45:37.985 --> 45:42.364
So, nobody through the back of this,
and nobody through this side.

45:42.448 --> 45:44.116
Where do you have him coming in from?

45:44.492 --> 45:46.452
- Huh?
- Where's he coming in from?

45:46.661 --> 45:50.038
- This hallway.
- They're gonna wait behind the curtain?

45:50.122 --> 45:52.332
No, the people are coming
in from the opposite.

45:52.416 --> 45:53.333
The opposite side.

45:53.417 --> 45:55.210
From the back,
so they won't see.

45:55.294 --> 45:56.379
Gotcha, okay.

45:56.504 --> 46:00.215
They'll go in here, we'll move this,
and then you'll be set already.

46:00.299 --> 46:01.300
Okay.

46:01.676 --> 46:03.302
The first twenty people get selfies.

46:03.386 --> 46:05.762
After that, everybody
has to have their phones away.

46:05.846 --> 46:09.016
Okay. So in, wrap around, out.

46:09.100 --> 46:10.893
Wrap around this way, boom.

46:12.186 --> 46:14.730
Do you have a head count
for how many people, today?

46:14.814 --> 46:15.731
One hundred sixty.

46:15.815 --> 46:19.235
Not bad. We did 250 in Seattle.

46:21.737 --> 46:23.698
That was good!

46:34.875 --> 46:35.918
This way.

46:46.304 --> 46:48.055
Your hands are sweaty!

46:48.389 --> 46:51.309
No, he just put some disinfectant on them.

46:53.978 --> 46:55.980
- Here's the elevator.
- Smells good.

47:01.569 --> 47:03.738
Very nice! How much?

47:05.781 --> 47:08.993
She's the oldest woman
in Kazakhstan. She's 42.

47:46.906 --> 47:50.617
Shamir and Tairon run
their invite-only training program

47:50.701 --> 47:55.164
out of an abandoned prison
in the middle of fucking nowhere, Florida.

47:55.331 --> 47:59.376
The program consists of anyone,
from your modern-day celebrity bodyguard

47:59.460 --> 48:02.588
to special forces operatives
from across the globe.

48:03.089 --> 48:05.716
Phase one, shooting range warm-up.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.009
You want to pop your cherry.

48:07.093 --> 48:09.970
The guns have been
in a case for a couple of days,

48:10.054 --> 48:12.180
couple of weeks,
depending on how much you shoot.

48:12.264 --> 48:14.558
You want to pop your cherry,
zero your weapon.

48:14.642 --> 48:17.603
Basically, make sure that your scopes,
your sights are in-line.

48:18.020 --> 48:19.771
Just get that first couple off.

48:19.855 --> 48:21.732
It's kind of like when you're a virgin.

48:21.816 --> 48:25.360
You might not knock it out of the park
the first time, but once you feel that

48:25.444 --> 48:30.115
moist, tender sweetness, you're gonna
remember it for the second time

48:30.199 --> 48:31.492
and be better prepared.

48:31.826 --> 48:33.577
Shooters ready! Targets!

48:37.581 --> 48:41.126
You want to make sure that
your scope or your sights are on track.

48:41.210 --> 48:44.004
We do it from 25 yards or 36 yards.

48:45.297 --> 48:47.341
After that, we go through
some basic drills,

48:47.425 --> 48:50.511
a couple of rounds to the chest,
a couple to the head.

48:51.137 --> 48:53.305
So you do your two rounds. Two, two.

48:54.056 --> 48:58.519
As soon as you grab that pistol,
your support hand comes off the rifle.

49:14.160 --> 49:16.954
Phase two,
principal transportation.

49:17.663 --> 49:20.124
Venue arrival and extract.

49:20.666 --> 49:24.127
What that entails is,
we have a three-vehicle caravan,

49:24.211 --> 49:26.004
first vehicle being the lead vehicle,

49:26.088 --> 49:28.924
second vehicle being the vehicle
that occupies the principal.

49:29.133 --> 49:31.468
The term "principal" is gonna relate

49:31.552 --> 49:33.679
to the person we are hired to protect.

49:34.472 --> 49:38.267
All angles are gonna be covered
by somebody. All right.

49:38.434 --> 49:41.103
Whenever everybody gives the okay,
everything is clear,

49:41.437 --> 49:43.022
the agent is gonna get out.

49:47.526 --> 49:49.820
- Contact front!
- Contact front!

49:56.994 --> 49:58.829
Phase three, the shoot house.

50:09.131 --> 50:12.426
About the shoot house.
In military terms, it's called "MOUT".

50:12.510 --> 50:14.136
Military Operations in Urban Terrain.

50:14.762 --> 50:16.888
Before you go into the building,
it's got to be clear.

50:16.972 --> 50:20.059
If you're doing a two-man room-clearing,

50:20.518 --> 50:24.480
the guy who is doing the lead is always
gonna have his rifle pointing up.

50:25.648 --> 50:27.983
After that has been cleared,
you either go inside,

50:28.108 --> 50:29.944
nothing's clear, you come out of the room.

50:45.084 --> 50:47.962
Even if he's got body armor,
it's gonna be right about here.

50:48.212 --> 50:50.714
So right here, he's gonna
be pretty much done.

50:51.131 --> 50:53.634
It's gonna go through the neck,
right on the bottom of the neck,

50:53.842 --> 50:57.805
it's gonna come out through the back.
Incapacitated immediately.

50:58.722 --> 51:02.476
We train so much because sometimes
you're gonna present your weapon,

51:02.560 --> 51:06.605
have your finger on the trigger,
and right before you press that trigger,

51:06.897 --> 51:09.275
you're going to say,
"This is not a threat."

51:10.734 --> 51:13.487
You go into situations
where you're not gonna know

51:13.821 --> 51:18.367
and you have to make the call
in one second or less than one second.

51:18.993 --> 51:22.746
Anywhere you see a target on the wall,
engage it, two rounds.

51:24.999 --> 51:26.166
Call what you see.

51:26.875 --> 51:29.795
Call me right, call me left.
Doorway right, doorway left.

51:30.004 --> 51:31.588
I don't want to go into the tactics

51:31.672 --> 51:34.383
because it's being used
by our guys overseas.

51:34.758 --> 51:38.971
It's just one of those things
that if you're not in the business,

51:39.346 --> 51:40.389
it's best not to know.

51:55.904 --> 51:57.659
The house we're
coming up to, here,

51:57.790 --> 52:01.376
is 799 East Third Street.

52:01.827 --> 52:03.912
This is the house.
We used to call it the "Haunty".

52:04.371 --> 52:06.874
This is where we killed
three people, inside.

52:07.041 --> 52:10.585
Bucky Barrett, John MacIntyre,
and Deborah Hussey,

52:10.669 --> 52:11.754
she was the last one.

52:12.171 --> 52:15.883
They were all buried in the basement.
There was a dirt floor down there.

52:16.216 --> 52:20.763
Bucky Barrett,
by many accounts, was a very nice guy.

52:22.181 --> 52:24.266
He was a very good safe cracker.

52:24.892 --> 52:29.480
And he had pulled off a heist at a bank...

52:30.522 --> 52:34.276
that got away with a lot of stuff.
A lot of money,

52:34.360 --> 52:37.738
some of it belonging to the mafia,
and jewelry.

52:39.156 --> 52:40.532
Bulger found out about it.

52:41.200 --> 52:43.702
So, a plan was made to shake him down

52:43.786 --> 52:48.331
and Bucky was gonna come
and meet this jewelry dealer,

52:48.415 --> 52:52.503
for lack of a better word,
a guy who was stealing diamonds for sale.

52:52.920 --> 52:55.923
And when Bucky walked in the house
to meet him, that was me.

52:56.799 --> 52:58.967
And I shook his hand and grabbed him

52:59.218 --> 53:03.472
and Whitey stepped out with a machine gun
and basically was taken hostage.

53:04.348 --> 53:06.725
They'd gotten a lot of money
out of Bucky Barrett,

53:07.309 --> 53:10.938
but Bulger decided
he was gonna kill him.

53:11.480 --> 53:14.191
And it was all supposed to be
a shake-down, to let him go,

53:14.316 --> 53:18.570
but Whitey decided to kill him.
So Bucky was killed.

53:20.030 --> 53:26.537
That was the basement where Whitey,
Stevie, Kevin and Pattony became diggers.

53:26.912 --> 53:28.706
They dug holes in the basement,

53:29.289 --> 53:32.626
they put a body in...
In this case, it was Bucky Barrett.

53:32.710 --> 53:35.713
They covered it up, and they put
two more bodies there...

53:36.672 --> 53:38.424
after they put Bucky Barrett there.

53:39.466 --> 53:43.386
Then, you have the case of John MacIntyre,
who was involved with the Valhalla

53:43.470 --> 53:46.932
who was the ship that went over to Ireland
with seven tons of weapons on it.

53:47.808 --> 53:50.894
He didn't realize that he was dealing
with dangerous people

53:51.186 --> 53:53.147
and he got grabbed coming off the boat.

53:53.439 --> 53:54.857
Valhalla, when it docked,

53:55.399 --> 53:58.943
Customs agents grabbed him
and shortly thereafter,

53:59.027 --> 54:01.321
he started cooperating with Quincy Police

54:01.405 --> 54:04.658
and we found out about it
and he was killed.

54:05.743 --> 54:07.035
Then you had Deborah Hussey.

54:07.911 --> 54:10.539
That was Stevie Flemmi's step-daughter.

54:11.999 --> 54:16.503
She was killed because Stevie
was having sexual relations with...

54:17.588 --> 54:18.630
You know.

54:19.089 --> 54:20.924
She knew too much of Stevie's business.

54:21.383 --> 54:23.469
She was an embarrassment to him,

54:23.969 --> 54:27.639
and so Jim Bulger
and Stevie Flemmi decided to kill her.

54:28.098 --> 54:30.434
And she came in the same house
and was killed.

54:30.684 --> 54:32.352
And they were all buried in the cellar.

54:33.145 --> 54:36.064
The final note in that
is that after Whitey had...

54:37.649 --> 54:40.319
After Whitey had strangled her,

54:40.819 --> 54:45.824
they detected that she might
still be alive, and so her stepfather...

54:46.950 --> 54:50.496
with a piece of rope and a stick,
garroted her.

54:52.873 --> 54:58.337
A guy who was a secret FBI informant
who was protected by FBI agents.

54:59.338 --> 55:02.132
Jim's normal routine was,
after he had killed someone,

55:02.216 --> 55:04.718
he would go upstairs
and lay down and take a nap.

55:05.302 --> 55:08.471
I mean, it was like an aphrodisiac
for him, or taking a valium.

55:08.555 --> 55:10.182
He was just nice and relaxed.

55:10.474 --> 55:12.517
And for the next couple of weeks
he was relaxed,

55:12.601 --> 55:14.061
it was just like a stress relief.

55:14.394 --> 55:18.982
Then you'd see it build up in him again.
But killing people relaxed him.

55:25.739 --> 55:27.449
Later on, the house was being sold.

55:28.075 --> 55:29.618
And we had to go back down

55:30.202 --> 55:33.371
and exhume all the bodies.
And it wasn't nice.

55:33.455 --> 55:36.750
One body was only in there
for six months.

55:37.251 --> 55:39.545
So, the smell was pretty bad.

55:39.962 --> 55:42.547
We took them out,
dug them up at nighttime,

55:42.631 --> 55:46.635
put them in body bags and transported
them over to this other place...

55:47.469 --> 55:49.721
that we had over on Hallet Street.

55:50.097 --> 55:53.100
This was a spot that we picked out.
It was real convenient.

55:53.392 --> 55:56.478
It was, maybe, about two miles
from where the house was.

55:56.812 --> 56:00.106
It was all brush, here,
and scrub and trees and stuff,

56:00.190 --> 56:04.068
so it was a perfect spot.
We threw the bodies in there

56:04.152 --> 56:06.446
and covered it with the dirt
from the duffle bags.

56:06.697 --> 56:11.201
Over here, somewhere,
is where I was lying.

56:13.078 --> 56:16.039
I've got a look at the doorway,
the angle, to find out the exact spot.

56:16.957 --> 56:17.958
But...

56:21.587 --> 56:23.630
I was probably lying right around here.

56:25.007 --> 56:30.429
At one point, I had a grease gun,
a machine gun with the silencer on it.

56:30.679 --> 56:35.893
I had the police scanner in my ear
and we were listening to calls and stuff.

56:36.184 --> 56:38.312
Whitey and Stevie walked over there...

56:38.562 --> 56:40.939
Actually, crawled over there,
where the bodies were,

56:41.189 --> 56:44.151
and he wanted to check it out.
So, while I was here on watch,

56:44.818 --> 56:47.278
this kid pulled up
and got out of the car

56:47.362 --> 56:49.656
and started to relieve himself,
go to the bathroom.

56:50.449 --> 56:54.578
We were really quiet. We all just
froze on the ground, just waiting,

56:54.870 --> 56:57.539
and he got back in the car and left.

56:58.332 --> 57:00.792
Jim Bulger came over to me afterwards
and he was upset.

57:01.335 --> 57:02.919
He said I let him get too close.

57:03.003 --> 57:06.256
He said, "There's plenty of room
in the hole. We could put him in there."

57:06.590 --> 57:10.760
So I guess the kid was lucky it was me
that night instead of Whitey,

57:10.844 --> 57:12.804
because Whitey
would have killed him right away.

57:14.139 --> 57:17.183
Eventually, the police came here
and they exhumed the bodies.

57:17.267 --> 57:19.061
Hold up. To be clear,

57:19.394 --> 57:21.855
the only reason the cops knew
where the bodies were

57:21.980 --> 57:25.108
was because Kevin exposed them
more than a decade later,

57:25.275 --> 57:27.527
after finding out Whitey was an informant.

57:28.195 --> 57:29.363
More on this, later.

57:30.280 --> 57:34.368
They found three bodies, here,
and two bodies over in the Neponset.

57:34.952 --> 57:36.787
One body over at Tenean Beach.

57:37.245 --> 57:40.332
And... You know.
A lot people got killed back then.

57:40.791 --> 57:42.876
And a lot of bodies got buried.

57:43.377 --> 57:45.795
Back then, if there was no body,
there was no crime,

57:45.879 --> 57:47.464
and that's the reason they were buried.

57:49.257 --> 57:52.427
But I do know,
from the investigators,

57:52.928 --> 57:55.097
that Flemmi and Bulger were concerned

57:55.430 --> 57:58.266
that Kevin didn't have it in him
to kill people.

57:59.434 --> 58:03.605
To me, that's a positive.

58:04.856 --> 58:06.066
To be sure.

58:06.733 --> 58:10.737
I think the evidence at trial
and the evidence we were able to uncover

58:10.821 --> 58:13.699
through other witnesses
did in fact corroborate Weeks

58:13.991 --> 58:18.036
in that he was basically an accessory
to a lot of these murders.

58:18.120 --> 58:21.707
He wasn't the actual shooter or killer,
but he was there and he was part of it.

58:21.832 --> 58:23.416
He was a lookout on some of them,

58:23.500 --> 58:26.586
he witnessed others,
he helped rebury bodies.

58:26.878 --> 58:31.049
So, he certainly had a serious role
in some horrific crimes.

58:41.810 --> 58:44.312
It's no secret
that the bodyguard business

58:44.396 --> 58:46.064
is a male-dominated industry.

58:46.523 --> 58:49.067
That being said, there are a ton of smart,

58:49.359 --> 58:51.945
tough-as-nails women
who are extremely successful

58:52.029 --> 58:53.655
in the field of personal protection.

58:54.364 --> 58:56.366
Our story takes us to London, England,

58:56.450 --> 58:59.202
where we meet seasoned
professional Jackie Davis

58:59.369 --> 59:01.580
and her team of all-female bodyguards.

59:02.289 --> 59:04.707
In addition to hostage rescues
in the Middle East,

59:04.791 --> 59:09.337
Jackie's experience includes protecting
JK Rowling and Saudi royalty.

59:09.963 --> 59:12.215
Jackie's team shows us
exactly what it takes

59:12.299 --> 59:14.801
to get a client
in and out of a venue, safely,

59:15.218 --> 59:18.513
starting with advanced security
before the principal arrives.

59:19.806 --> 59:23.810
So, advanced work is all about
pre-preparation and planning,

59:23.935 --> 59:26.688
before you bring
your principal to a venue.

59:27.064 --> 59:29.857
You have to look at the choke points
that could be on the road.

59:29.941 --> 59:31.985
You need to know the entrance and exits

59:32.069 --> 59:36.531
where you can have a smooth entrance
or exit for your principal.

59:36.948 --> 59:40.952
It's all about being aware
of what's around the venue.

59:41.078 --> 59:45.499
It's all about being able to get
your principal in and out, safely,

59:45.916 --> 59:50.170
and to look for areas where
a possible attacker might lurk.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:01.639
So, once we enter the venue,

01:00:01.723 --> 01:00:04.225
the first thing we want to do
is find the venue manager,

01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:08.188
because he has the local knowledge
of what happens in his venue.

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:11.942
So, we'd go and introduce ourselves
and ask for his co-operation.

01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:15.695
Once we're inside,
we're looking at things like windows,

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.240
material that's on walls
in case it's offensive,

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:21.159
because some clients
are from the Middle East

01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:25.163
and they would find picture of half-naked
men and women on the walls offensive.

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:28.083
The gambling machine
would have to be switched off

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:29.793
if they were the clients coming.

01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:31.502
What we're looking for in this venue,

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:34.756
is somewhere for our principal
to have a quiet meeting,

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:39.761
away from a window,
but with the facilities quite close.

01:00:40.095 --> 01:00:41.680
Here would be a good place.

01:00:41.847 --> 01:00:46.476
We could then cover the entrance
and exits into this place,

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:51.064
including the kitchen door, so that nobody
would be able to get to our principal.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.025
Okay, so we're gonna check the toilets.

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.821
Check that there's nobody in the stalls.

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:00.323
We're also going to check...

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:07.038
at the back, to make sure that no weapons
or explosives have been hidden...

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:15.005
in any of the flushers.

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:20.259
This window, here, looks like it's broken.
We'll have to deal with that.

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:23.346
We'd either have to close that or I'd
have to put somebody outside, there.

01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:26.474
But the place is clean,
acceptable for the principal

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:30.729
to come in here and use these facilities,
providing there is nobody else in here.

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:34.190
We want to check all of the
entrance and exits

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:38.153
to make sure that we can get our principal
in or out in an emergency, smoothly.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.782
Also, to check if the bad guys
can get in or out behind us.

01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:44.784
So, we're gonna go out
this entrance, here.

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:50.290
Brings us straight out into
a smoking area.

01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:54.252
So, we probably wouldn't use this
for our principal if they don't smoke,

01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:56.713
because they may find the smell
quite offensive.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:02:02.301
We're coming round into
a wide-open car-parking area,

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:06.306
which is quite good, because there's
not a lot of places for people to hide.

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:09.976
But we have to be aware of the buildings
that are over the road.

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:14.356
And I can see that that's a garage,
so therefore, we'd be very careful.

01:02:14.522 --> 01:02:18.484
We can cover off the road up there,
we can cover off the road down there,

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:21.363
so our principal can have
a smooth drive away.

01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:44.635
So, we have a female operative over here
who's covering the kitchen door.

01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:48.097
That's to make sure that nobody
who shouldn't be coming through there

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:51.268
comes through there, and she's also
covering this back bar area.

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:54.813
The operator over here,
she's covering the entrance,

01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:58.900
and the toilet, so again, we can be aware
of who's coming in and out.

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:01.777
We have another operator
who's covering the window,

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:04.072
so she can see what's going on outside.

01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:08.743
And then our other operator is
around here. She's covering...

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:11.621
She's sitting at the bar,
looking like she belongs here,

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:15.250
but she's actually covering
the other entrances and exits

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:19.129
so that nobody that should come near
the principal, gets near the principal.

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:23.091
The venue has now been compromised
and we have to get the principal out.

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:26.677
The back-up female will come up behind,

01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:30.640
the front females will go out ahead
to make sure it's clear

01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:32.892
for her to get straight out
and into the vehicle.

01:04:00.211 --> 01:04:05.675
Absolutely, I was a racist
and thought like a racist prior to 1994

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:07.427
and meeting President Mandela.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:10.972
I mean, I'm one of those rare white
South Africans that will actually say,

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:14.893
"Yeah, I did vote for the old National
party under apartheid."

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:20.732
Absolutely. I was brought up thinking
that that kind of racist behavior,

01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:24.152
in society... The context was normal.

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:26.612
So, yeah, I was a racist, you know?

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:31.951
And I very quickly learned that
that was wrong, and I learned it by

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:34.996
watching President Mandela
change this country.

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:37.039
In Nelson Mandela's case,

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:38.374
we had an excellent example

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:41.794
of a person that dealt with
everyone around him

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:46.383
irrespective of the color of their skin,
their wealth status, their position.

01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:49.052
He dealt with people
with the utmost of respect.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:53.014
You have no choice but to change
and to follow that kind of example.

01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:56.267
And because his was one
of dignity and love

01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:58.436
and caring and respecting people.

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:05.818
It's not easy to undo 33 or 34 years,
whatever it was,

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:09.989
of conditioning
under a particular political system.

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:12.575
When you're 33,
you're pretty much who you are.

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:16.078
But as a 33-year-old,
I started to think, "Hang on a minute,

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:19.832
I've been wrong,
and everything I've been taught

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.918
and told and brought up with was wrong."

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:25.088
So, I very easily and very quickly

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:29.633
bought into Madiba's concept
of this new South Africa.

01:05:29.717 --> 01:05:32.429
I bought into it entirely,
because I saw it first-hand.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.057
When you work with someone
for a long time,

01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:39.935
it's only natural that there's more
of a relationship developing.

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:42.147
A father-son relationship.

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:48.111
I served him in a very specific capacity.
I respected him and I loved him, dearly.

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:52.365
But to call him a "friend", no,
it's a bit too familiar.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.868
He was my President
and he was my protectee

01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:59.581
and I loved him like my own grandfather,
but it stopped there.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:02.333
Nelson Mandela was like a father to us.

01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:11.468
And that relationship must not cloud
your judgment, as a professional.

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:15.930
I knew, unquestionably,

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:19.559
that I was willing,
if called upon to do so,

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:22.312
to sacrifice my own life

01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:26.191
to protect that
of President Nelson Mandela.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.776
I would have died for Madiba.

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:34.949
Because of what I was trained for.
I was a bullet catcher

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:38.328
I was a professional.

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:44.542
Besides that, I was looking after
one of the icons...

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:47.212
of the world.

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:51.257
Who wouldn't want to die for him?

01:06:56.221 --> 01:07:01.643
On December the 5th, 2013,
the heart of South Africa stopped beating.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:06.439
At 95 years of age,
Nelson Mandela passed away.

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:12.153
How did Madiba's death affect me,
and was it a time to reflect?

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:18.117
It was... It's a very strange thing
because our entire nation,

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:22.830
and, for that matter, the entire world,
you know, we're very conscious

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:27.501
of the fact that we had Madiba with us
on borrowed time.

01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:31.464
Everybody knew how ill he was
and he was getting older and frailer.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:35.051
You know that one day, our day will come.

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:40.014
I never thought that something like that
would happen to Madiba.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.767
Even though we were expecting
this announcement at some time,

01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:46.980
it was still a tremendous shock
when it came.

01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:51.067
But it didn't take long,
and I'm talking about a matter of hours.

01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:56.614
During that morning,
somewhere along the line, our grief

01:07:56.781 --> 01:08:00.451
turned to celebrating
what was an exceptional life.

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:03.704
This was a day to mourn

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:08.501
one life lost and to a day to mark
the many lives made by Nelson Mandela.

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:12.671
As much as you expect something like that
to happen, you're never ready for it.

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:15.008
Therefore, when Nelson Mandela
passed away,

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:17.426
people were genuinely feeling the grief.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:21.055
Even if they they'd never met him,
they personally felt affected.

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.015
It was a person that we all looked up to,

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:26.769
a person that had no resentment
despite what he went through.

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:29.147
He was a much better person
than any of us.

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:34.569
We, as the former protection team,
were given an extraordinary honor.

01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:38.822
We were called up, all of us
were invited to that ceremony

01:08:38.906 --> 01:08:42.535
in the aircraft hangar,
and we were called up, ten at a time,

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:47.040
to stand five on either side
of that casket,

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:51.711
draped in the national flag,
while the ceremonies proceeded around us.

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:54.712
And we were just given
two or three minutes

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:57.050
with our own
private thoughts and memories,

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.426
standing alongside his coffin.

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:04.265
It was just one of those
seminal moments in my life.

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:09.228
Mandiba, for us, is an icon.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:13.024
He's the father of all the nation.

01:09:15.943 --> 01:09:19.279
He was able to bring us
together as a country.

01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:24.868
Very emotional. Very emotional.

01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:32.459
It gave me the closure that I
didn't fully have at the time.

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:37.381
And now, all I've got are all my memories,
filed away here, in the back of my mind.

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:41.469
It was a great five years.

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:45.805
Guys, I'm about as emotionally
drained as I can be,

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:48.393
so I think we probably need
to leave it there.

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:05.576
Having a girlfriend was difficult.
I couldn't have one.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.122
You wouldn't touch a woman
for a long time, the way I did it.

01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:12.124
You wouldn't drink.
I never smoked, but you wouldn't party.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:14.377
You wouldn't take
a night off or do anything.

01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:19.424
I was a robot for so long that I said,
"This is the way you need to be."

01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:23.469
The number one thing you sacrifice
that is the most valuable thing

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:25.930
is time. You can't get it back.

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:29.308
I love being able to protect
and being a part of something

01:10:29.517 --> 01:10:32.148
and make money doing it.
It's what I'm here to do.

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:36.441
But then, time goes
and then you start realizing,

01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:39.026
"What am I doing all of this for?"

01:10:39.444 --> 01:10:42.780
Now you're 37, 38,
and you're thinking to yourself

01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:45.283
"When was the last time
I celebrated Christmas?

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:48.911
When was the last time
I ate a Thanksgiving dinner?

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:52.665
When was the last time
I had a girlfriend I could hold on to?"

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:55.126
You miss all that.
It's a sacrifice that you do,

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:58.546
because if you stop doing
all of these holidays,

01:10:58.838 --> 01:11:00.214
then you'll realize you're missing it,

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:04.427
but you don't realize because you're
doing holidays, it's just their holidays.

01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:07.221
I'm at Bieber's driveway for Christmas.

01:11:07.305 --> 01:11:09.766
There's snow on the ground,
Christmas colors everywhere.

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:12.101
I know it's Christmas,
there's presents here and there.

01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:15.354
It's not like I missed Christmas.
I was there for Christmas,

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:17.648
but not my Christmas.

01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:20.985
So, I think time
is a big thing you sacrifice,

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.239
And being a "celebrity bodyguard"...
People who call themselves that

01:11:25.323 --> 01:11:27.866
are assholes, because you're a bodyguard.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:31.287
Your client is a celebrity.
Don't call yourself a celebrity bodyguard,

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:33.247
because you're giving
a glamorous name to it.

01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:36.542
By no means is this a glamorous industry.
There's no glamour to this shit.

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:39.211
And that's my biggest regret.
If I could do it over again,

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:41.172
would I have not done it? Maybe.

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:44.509
I've got buddies
that don't have much money,

01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:49.514
and they've got a beautiful family,
and kids, and a wife, and this and that.

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:52.307
But they're driving a beat-up mini-van
and... You know what?

01:11:52.391 --> 01:11:56.562
They're ten times happier than I am
because they've got to experience that.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:12:00.900
To me, the number one sacrifice is time.

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:04.028
You look back at my entire career,
and what I've done.

01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:07.114
I've got a lot of memories,
I've got a lot of memories.

01:12:07.448 --> 01:12:09.242
I've seen it all, I've done it all.

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:14.747
But I can honestly, genuinely say, not one
of those memories were mine, at least.

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:19.377
I lived 50's life.
I went to his Thanksgiving.

01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:21.921
Went to Lil' Wayne's daughter's birthday.

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:25.591
That's something I do with these guys.
I make them come home.

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:27.635
They don't want to come home?
"You're coming home."

01:12:28.469 --> 01:12:29.637
Don't end up like me.

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:32.974
Even the guys say,
"I don't want to end up like Anton."

01:12:34.892 --> 01:12:37.937
I realized that about a year or two ago,
and it broke my heart.

01:12:39.564 --> 01:12:42.316
If you're doing it because you
you want girls

01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:44.360
or because you want money,

01:12:44.569 --> 01:12:47.363
then you're doing it
for the wrong reasons. Don't do it.

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:51.576
If you're okay with not having
any memories of your own

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.410
for the next five, ten or 15 years,

01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:55.288
you're okay with living
someone else's life...

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:57.790
then this is something to look into.

01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:00.834
You're gonna go days without eating,
days without sleeping,

01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:01.961
days without shitting.

01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:04.589
You're gonna go months without
touching a woman's arm,

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:08.050
maybe a year, maybe more,
if you do it the right way.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:11.094
A lot of bodyguards in this industry
do it the wrong way,

01:13:11.178 --> 01:13:14.348
and they eat like kings, and they fuck
a different groupie every night.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.850
But those guys are short-lived.

01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:18.769
But if somebody was to come up to me
and ask me right now,

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:21.814
"I want to be a bodyguard, what do I do?"
I'd tell them, "Go to school.

01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:24.150
Don't do this shit. Don't do this."

01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:36.829
Back in '94,
we were receiving information

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:40.333
that there was a grand jury going on
and people were getting called in.

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:44.837
We were getting it from people
on the street that were getting called in

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:46.964
and we were getting it
from law enforcement.

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:52.303
So, Jim Bulger and Steve Flemmi
during '94 were basically on a mini-lamb.

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:54.931
They'd come back for a week,
take off for two weeks.

01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:58.893
December 23rd, '94
we got a tip-off from John Connolly

01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:00.645
that the indictments were imminent,

01:14:00.978 --> 01:14:03.648
that they were gonna try
to round them all up over the holidays.

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:05.691
The building next to it,

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:08.319
that we're coming up to right now,
is the liquor store.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.784
That's where John Connolly came
and tipped me off about Whitey Bulger.

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:16.660
The indictments were coming down,

01:14:16.744 --> 01:14:20.122
so he could take off.
Stevie Flemmi and the rest of them.

01:14:20.581 --> 01:14:23.042
Whitey was the only one to take off
and the rest got pinched.

01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:26.086
Had they stayed and decided,
"All right, they'll take the hit,

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:29.924
they'll plead guilty or whatever",
they might've done four, five years.

01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:32.718
And they wouldn't have
known about the killings.

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:36.722
The information
about the killings came out...

01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:40.267
because they took off.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.604
Everything began
to unravel for Kevin Weeks

01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:45.231
after Whitey became a fugitive.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:48.567
Not only did he find out
that his best friend and mentor

01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:51.445
had been an FBI informant
for over a decade,

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:55.658
but he was also arrested
and indicted on 29 charges.

01:14:58.285 --> 01:15:00.371
When I was arrested,
I got arrested in '99,

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.123
and it had been two years
since it had come out

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:06.585
that Whitey and Stevie were
informants for the FBI.

01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:12.091
So, it was a tough time realizing
that your best friend was an informant.

01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:15.386
When it came out that he was,
in fact, an FBI informant,

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:18.305
that also helped us
in terms of making a case,

01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:21.683
because other people were now
willing to cooperate against him

01:15:21.767 --> 01:15:23.853
once they found out he was an informant.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.981
I was saying to myself,
"I'm gonna do a life bit for these guys,

01:15:28.065 --> 01:15:29.399
they've been ratting on everybody."

01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:32.236
I was brought up
and preached to by them

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:35.113
that you never rat on your friends,
never rat on your enemies.

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:37.199
If you've got a problem,
you take it to the street.

01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:40.369
Then I realized that everything
that was taught to me was a lie.

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:47.126
Kevin was incensed to learn
that Bulger had been an informant.

01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:50.379
He thought they were simply
bribing Connolly

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:52.339
and they were bribing cops.

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:56.427
Yeah, you know, I questioned it,
we had a relationship.

01:15:56.802 --> 01:16:00.890
As far as... We were paying
for information, and I knew about that.

01:16:01.348 --> 01:16:04.310
And I knew he had corrupted
members of law enforcement.

01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:08.021
I doubted it until I started
seeing the paperwork

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:11.525
and I started reading about
the information they were given.

01:16:11.609 --> 01:16:13.986
And I knew it was accurate,
because people that were around us

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:16.155
were arrested for these particular crimes.

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:19.533
So I knew the information was accurate
and that they were informants.

01:16:20.284 --> 01:16:22.745
Broken by the betrayal
of his best friend,

01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:25.372
Weeks decided to make a deal with the FBI.

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:29.835
Kevin admitted to being an accomplice
in five of Whitey's murders,

01:16:30.044 --> 01:16:34.882
leading the feds to the final burial site
of the bodies on 799 East Third Street.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.053
Some people make fun of Kevin
for how quickly he turned.

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:41.388
He's been called "Two-Weeks Weeks",

01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:45.226
because it didn't take him long
to turn after he was charged,

01:16:45.476 --> 01:16:46.727
they had nowhere to go.

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:50.523
It didn't take too many meetings
before I realized that...

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:54.944
A, that he was ready
to "flip", so-called...

01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:57.654
Not ready, but wanted to.

01:16:57.738 --> 01:17:01.742
Had made his decision,
probably before we met.

01:17:02.368 --> 01:17:06.872
When I came back here to get sentenced
I really had no expectations.

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:08.833
I was actually expecting the worst.

01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:12.837
I figured I was gonna get 20 years.
I already had four and a half in,

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:16.006
and I figured, you know,
I had another 13 to do.

01:17:16.549 --> 01:17:18.259
So, that was the worst-case scenario.

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:23.556
Best-case scenario is,
basically, time served.

01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:25.432
So, I had no expectations,

01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:29.311
I was prepared to go back and serve out
whatever time I had left, you know?

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:32.982
But when he told me...
The judge said, "Mr. Weeks, 72 months."

01:17:33.566 --> 01:17:35.651
He said, "I hope I did the right thing,
and good luck."

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:37.319
I couldn't believe it.

01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:40.447
The first thing I thought was,
"I've got a second chance at life,

01:17:40.865 --> 01:17:42.283
to make the most of it."

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:45.202
Typically, when a person co-operates,

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:48.706
they get a reduced sentence,
and Weeks was no different.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:52.751
He cooperated thoroughly
and he testified and in return,

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:57.131
the judge gave him a sentence that is more
lenient than he would have received.

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.217
After 16 years on the run,

01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:03.804
ten of which being on the FBI's
Top 10 Most Wanted list,

01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:06.182
Whitey Bulger was finally captured.

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:08.809
He came back to Boston to face his trial

01:18:08.893 --> 01:18:13.063
and the state's key witness,
his best friend, Kevin Weeks.

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:16.317
It was a lousy feeling,
to look at the guy and...

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:20.737
The feelings I had for him...
Like I said, I still liked him,

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:23.657
but at the same time,
I was mad at him for betrayal.

01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:25.951
It was a lousy feeling, anyways.

01:18:26.327 --> 01:18:28.912
It was a lousy feeling testifying, period.

01:18:28.996 --> 01:18:31.373
Never mind against a guy
I considered my friend.

01:18:31.498 --> 01:18:34.417
My view of it is that
they would have been at great risk,

01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:38.505
probably, in proving,
in getting convictions,

01:18:38.589 --> 01:18:42.384
in every case that Kevin testified in,
if he hadn't been a witness.

01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:45.596
He really made this thing work
for the government.

01:18:45.763 --> 01:18:50.017
So, the anger over that,
and of course, self-interest,

01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:52.895
led him to a deal.

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:55.189
The deal was an awfully good one.

01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:57.983
He said, "Five years, that's nothing."

01:18:58.067 --> 01:19:01.570
That's right, five years for five murders.

01:19:01.862 --> 01:19:06.950
He wasn't the person that killed anyone
but he was a part of that

01:19:07.034 --> 01:19:09.286
and could have been
charged with felony murder.

01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:13.665
I can't say we didn't
harm innocent people,

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:15.876
because, basically, we preyed
on other criminals.

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:18.754
We extorted them, shook them down.

01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:23.216
People that we killed,
they have families that are innocent,

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.803
are extended families,
and it affected them.

01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:29.807
The people that were around us
that were criminals that we preyed upon,

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:32.142
I mean, that was the chance
they took, okay?

01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:35.145
That's what happens you're
involved in organized crime.

01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:37.856
But as far as their families,

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:41.359
you know, children, loved ones,
aunts, uncles, all of that?

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:43.279
We affected them, we hurt them.

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:47.157
And you know, it wasn't a good feeling
when you think back at it,

01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:48.826
of the harm you caused people.

01:20:04.925 --> 01:20:07.427
After another long day
of Biebermania,

01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:09.888
the energy has shifted inside the arena.

01:20:10.389 --> 01:20:14.059
The venue has been secured,
all staff are in position,

01:20:14.351 --> 01:20:16.854
the band and dancers
are all warmed up,

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:20.941
and 20,000 screaming fans
are ready for Justin Bieber.

01:20:21.692 --> 01:20:26.363
Before, during, and after the show,
Mikey is Justin's shadow.

01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:30.868
Even when Justin can't see Mikey,
he knows his bodyguard,

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:33.871
his friend, will always have his back.

01:21:01.899 --> 01:21:04.109
Let's go. Let's go, champ!

01:22:07.512 --> 01:22:09.632
- Dear Jesus.
- Dear Jesus.

01:22:09.716 --> 01:22:11.509
- Dear Lord.
- Dear Lord.

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:13.094
- Dear Jesus.
- Dear Jesus.

01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:15.013
- Dear Lord.
- Dear Lord.

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:16.848
- Dear Jesus.
- Dear Jesus.

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.600
- Get pumped up.
- Get pumped up.

01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:20.518
- Say what?
- Get pumped up!

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:22.354
- Say what?
- Get pumped up!

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:24.189
- Say, "uh"!
- Say, "uh"!

01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:26.191
- Say, "Jesus"!
- Say, "Jesus"!

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:28.026
- Say what?
- Say what?

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:29.986
- To the middle.
- To the middle.

01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:31.697
- For God!
- For God!

01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:35.617
Ducks, ducks, ducks, ducks,
quack, quack, quack, quack!

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.212
You did it!

01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:43.077
Protecting a client in 2014,
Shamir had to put his training to the test

01:24:43.161 --> 01:24:45.455
while coming face-to-face
with active shooters.

01:24:45.664 --> 01:24:49.251
Every time I kiss my kids,
it might be the last time.

01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:52.170
So I have to be perfect
when I'm out there.

01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:55.132
Working that life,
working that career field...

01:24:55.882 --> 01:24:57.009
takes a toll on you.

01:24:57.342 --> 01:24:58.552
On this particular night...

01:24:59.886 --> 01:25:02.973
there were some veiled threats
that would be carried out.

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:05.517
You could be riding in a bus,
they're blasting music,

01:25:05.726 --> 01:25:07.603
you literally won't hear a thing.

01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:13.775
But what you will hear are the sounds
of rifle rounds coming through steel

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:19.740
and the windows and the furniture
as they're buzzing right through.

01:25:20.157 --> 01:25:26.162
I just remember seeing curtains floating
in the interior of the cabin.

01:25:26.246 --> 01:25:27.581
It just didn't seem right.

01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:30.375
Then I started seeing little shards
and little splintering.

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:36.632
Then you realize.
This happens within, like, seconds.

01:25:37.591 --> 01:25:39.009
Your bus is in the fire.

01:25:40.093 --> 01:25:43.472
Automatic fire. Automatic rifle fire.

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:46.224
And it's coming from both sides.

01:25:48.226 --> 01:25:51.438
I told the,, "Get the fuck down,
everybody in the back."

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:54.399
Everybody started running toward the back.

01:25:55.359 --> 01:25:57.861
You hear all types of shit.
It's like a rap video.

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:00.614
But it's real life.

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:03.908
So, I have to discharge my weapon

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:07.704
through a closed window
at two vehicles simultaneously.

01:26:08.538 --> 01:26:12.751
So, I focused on the one shooter,
and after several rounds, I was able to...

01:26:15.337 --> 01:26:16.338
stop that threat.

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.342
As soon as I noticed that
that threat had stopped,

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:25.389
the second shooting stopped.
The shots stopped, they ceased.

01:26:27.099 --> 01:26:29.393
But when you talk about fucking
memorable experiences...

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:34.981
I'm here, today.

01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:41.905
Right now we're entering the drone area,

01:26:42.739 --> 01:26:48.495
which is a 360-degree field that's
constructed from a berm

01:26:48.995 --> 01:26:53.125
and it allows us to shoot at all angles
without having to worry about back shots.

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:56.586
So, right now, the scenario is,
we're gonna arrive at our destination,

01:26:57.462 --> 01:27:00.424
I'm gonna let the principal out,
me and Derrick, the guy next to you,

01:27:00.966 --> 01:27:05.095
and we're gonna walk to our vantage point
and we're gonna meet an opposing threat.

01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:09.516
It's unknown, what the threat is.
It's gonna be a live fire exercise.

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:31.496
Sir, would you come with me.

01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:56.897
Other side! Other side!
Watch your feet!

01:27:59.441 --> 01:28:01.943
In, in, in! Go, go, go!

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:12.621
Sir, you bleeding? Are you shot anywhere?
I have to check you, all right?

01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:18.001
Principal is out of the kill zone.

01:28:23.465 --> 01:28:24.883
Chase the vehicle. Chasing it.

01:29:01.378 --> 01:29:02.754
So, there you go.

01:29:03.296 --> 01:29:05.256
An inside look
at what it's like to protect

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:07.592
the rich, famous, and powerful,

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:10.262
as told by elite bodyguards
from across the globe.

01:29:11.429 --> 01:29:17.310
Always observing, preparing,
protecting the ones in the watchtower.
