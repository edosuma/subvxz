10:24.083 --> 10:25.917
WHAT YOU WOULD CALL
A LADIES' MAN. HEH.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.083
BUT I TELL HIM.
IT IS EASY.

10:27.083 --> 10:29.792
THERE'S ONLY ONE RULE,
PLAIN AND SIMPLE:

10:29.792 --> 10:33.375
GIVE THE LADIES
WHAT THEY WANT.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.750
HOW ABOUT GIVING ME
WHAT I WANT, ROB?

10:36.750 --> 10:38.834
I THOUGHT
YOU'D NEVER ASK.

10:38.834 --> 10:41.625
FRIDAY NIGHT OFF
SO I CAN STUDY
FOR THE PSATs.

10:41.625 --> 10:42.625
THEY'RE SATURDAY.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.708
YEAH, SURE.
WHY NOT? NO SWEAT.

10:44.708 --> 10:46.417
I REMEMBER
WHAT IT WAS LIKE.

10:46.417 --> 10:48.458
OF COURSE, I DIDN'T
TAKE THE PSATs.

10:48.458 --> 10:49.458
WHAT, DADDY BUILT
THE UNIVERSITY?

10:49.458 --> 10:51.750
NO, NO.
JUST ENDOWED IT.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.083
ACTUALLY,
I HIRED A RINGER.

10:55.291 --> 10:56.750
SERIOUSLY.
PAID SOME BRAINIAC

10:56.750 --> 10:58.458
A COUPLE
THOUSAND DOLLARS
TO TAKE IT FOR ME.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.834
WON ME
A SCHOLARSHIP, TOO.

11:01.166 --> 11:04.375
WELL, SINCE I DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF CASH...

11:04.375 --> 11:05.458
THANK YOU.

11:05.458 --> 11:08.291
I OWE YOU ONE.

11:08.291 --> 11:09.750
WELL, UH,
HERE'S A THOUGHT.

11:09.750 --> 11:12.667
YOU LET ME TAKE YOU OUT
FOR A POST-PSAT
CELEBRATION.

11:12.667 --> 11:16.125
SATURDAY NIGHT.
YOU AND ME.

11:16.125 --> 11:18.542
UH, THANKS, BUT, UM...

11:18.542 --> 11:20.834
HUSBAND DOESN'T REALLY
LIKE ME SEEING OTHER PEOPLE.

11:20.834 --> 11:24.333
OH, SURE. THOUGHT YOU
WERE GONNA SAY YOU
HAD TO WASH YOUR HAIR.

11:24.333 --> 11:25.708
NO, THAT'S WEDNESDAYS.

11:25.708 --> 11:28.834
ACTUALLY, ROB,
THE TRUTH IS...

11:28.834 --> 11:30.083
I'M A LESBIAN.

11:30.083 --> 11:30.667
OH...

11:30.667 --> 11:32.667
ANYONE I KNOW?

11:33.834 --> 11:35.000
SO, IS IT A DATE?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.625
SATURDAY NIGHT.
WHAT DO YA SAY?

11:37.750 --> 11:40.458
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
IF I JUST SAID NO?

11:40.458 --> 11:43.834
YEAH.
SURE THING, POTTER.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.792
NO PROBLEM.

12:09.417 --> 12:12.291
[CHUCKLES]

12:12.291 --> 12:14.542
I WAS STARTING
TO WORRY ABOUT YOU.

12:15.542 --> 12:17.959
I WAS SEARCHING
FOR THE PERFECT APPLE.

12:17.959 --> 12:20.208
GO AHEAD.
TAKE A BITE.

12:20.208 --> 12:22.625
SEE IF IT TASTES
AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.875
AND IF I DO?

12:24.875 --> 12:27.625
YOU WILL FOREVER
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL.

12:28.625 --> 12:31.000
GET OUT HERE, DAWSON.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.667
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT.

12:42.708 --> 12:43.750
[SIGHS]

12:43.750 --> 12:46.083
WELL, I HAVEN'T
BEEN OUT HERE SINCE...

12:46.083 --> 12:46.458
SINCE JOEY AND I WERE--

12:46.458 --> 12:48.166
JOEY?

12:48.166 --> 12:50.834
YOU MEAN
THE UBIQUITOUS
BRUNETTE?

12:50.834 --> 12:52.458
THE ONE WHO
HASN'T YET LEARNED

12:52.458 --> 12:54.000
THE POWER AND SWAY
SHE HOLDS OVER
THE HEARTS OF MEN?

12:56.208 --> 12:57.875
SHE LIVES DOWN THE CREEK.

12:57.875 --> 13:00.250
SHE USED TO SLEEP OVER
ALL THE TIME.

13:00.250 --> 13:03.375
BEFORE WE DEVELOPED
SECONDARY SEXUAL
CHARACTERISTICS.

13:03.375 --> 13:05.125
I HAD A BOY-NEXT-DOOR.

13:05.125 --> 13:06.250
YOU DID?

13:06.250 --> 13:06.875
DOESN'T EVERYBODY?

13:06.875 --> 13:08.625
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

13:08.625 --> 13:10.083
MONROE.

13:10.083 --> 13:13.041
WE LITERALLY LIVED
IN ADJOINING HOUSES
ON THE BASE.

13:13.041 --> 13:14.667
YOU WERE A MILITARY BRAT?

13:14.667 --> 13:15.917
U.S. ARMY,
BORN AND BRED.

13:15.917 --> 13:17.250
[LAUGHS]

13:17.250 --> 13:19.667
MATTER OF FACT,
WE COULD SEE INTO
EACH OTHER'S BEDROOMS.

13:19.667 --> 13:21.667
REALLY?

13:21.667 --> 13:23.500
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN...
CONVENIENT.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.166
NO KIDDING.

13:25.166 --> 13:27.166
ONLY PROBLEM IS...

13:27.166 --> 13:29.250
HE WAS MY DAD'S
COMMANDING OFFICER.

13:34.208 --> 13:36.000
I BROUGHT YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.875
WHAT IS THIS?

13:39.625 --> 13:41.458
CALL IT A STUDY AID.

13:41.458 --> 13:43.291
THAT IS NOT...

13:43.291 --> 13:45.583
OH, IT IS.

13:45.583 --> 13:48.125
AN ADVANCE COPY
OF SATURDAY'S PSAT.

13:49.291 --> 13:50.959
WHY ARE YOU
SHOWING THIS TO ME?

13:50.959 --> 13:52.250
WELL...

13:52.250 --> 13:56.083
I WAS PLANNING
ON GIVING IT TO YOU.

13:56.083 --> 13:57.917
THERE'S NO WAY
I COULD DO THAT.

13:57.917 --> 14:00.708
OH, DON'T BE
SO SELFISH, DAWSON.

14:00.708 --> 14:01.583
I MEAN, IF IT GOES
AGAINST YOUR MORAL CODE,

14:01.583 --> 14:03.417
FINE, BUT...

14:03.417 --> 14:07.792
SURELY THERE MUST BE
SOMEBODY YOU KNOW
WHO COULD USE IT.

14:10.875 --> 14:13.500
THE APPLE
WAS A METAPHOR.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.959
THIS IS THE REAL THING.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.208
AN ENVELOPE?

14:29.208 --> 14:31.375
THIS IS WHY YOU COVERTLY
HUSHED US INTO A CORNER?

14:31.375 --> 14:32.667
PACEY, READ THE FINE PRINT.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.917
IT SAYS E.T.S., AS IN
EDUCATIONAL TESTING SERVICE.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.000
DAWSON, THIS IS NOT
WHAT I THINK IT IS.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.583
THINK AGAIN.

14:39.583 --> 14:40.542
OH, GOD.

14:40.542 --> 14:41.834
HOW'D YOU GET THIS?

14:41.834 --> 14:42.875
DOES IT MATTER?

14:42.875 --> 14:44.000
OF COURSE IT MATTERS.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.041
WHEN WE'RE
ALL INCRIMINATED

14:45.041 --> 14:46.208
AND SENT
TO FEDERAL PRISON,

14:46.208 --> 14:48.333
I'D LIKE TO KNOW JUST WHO
I'M TAKING THE RAP FOR.

14:48.333 --> 14:49.959
SOMEONE
GAVE IT TO ME.

14:49.959 --> 14:51.125
A CERTAIN SOMEONE
WITH BLONDE LOCKS

14:51.125 --> 14:52.417
AND A NAME THAT
RHYMES WITH STEVE?

14:53.708 --> 14:55.041
OH, SHE'S GOOD.

14:55.041 --> 14:56.000
I LIKE THAT GIRL.
SHE'S GOOD.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.208
ONCE AGAIN,
DAWSON LEERY PROVES

14:58.208 --> 14:59.792
THE GROIN IS MIGHTIER
THAN THE BRAIN.

14:59.792 --> 15:00.875
HAVE YOU
LOOKED INSIDE?

15:00.875 --> 15:01.875
IT COULD BE A JOKE.

15:01.875 --> 15:03.375
ANYBODY CAN JUST
WHIP UP A LABEL.

15:03.375 --> 15:03.959
WELL, THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

15:03.959 --> 15:06.166
OH, GO AHEAD, PACEY.

15:06.166 --> 15:08.458
WAY TO COMPLETE YOUR
RETURN TO THE HALLS
OF ACADEMIC LOSERDOM.

TO OPEN IT UP, ANDIE.

15:11.208 --> 15:13.667
THAT YOU'RE REAL
COMFORTABLE WITH
THESE DAYS.

15:13.667 --> 15:15.583
LOOK, NOBODY'S
OPENING ANYTHING.

15:15.583 --> 15:16.959
DAWSON, JUST BRING IT BACK
TO WHERE YOU GOT IT,

15:16.959 --> 15:18.500
AND NONE OF US
EVER SAW IT.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.667
GEE, NOT TO SOUND
LIKE THE ONLY TYPICAL
HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENT HERE,

15:20.667 --> 15:23.583
BUT...APPARENTLY,
AS THE ONLY TYPICAL
HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENT,

15:23.583 --> 15:25.000
WHAT'S THE HARM
IN PEEKING?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.458
PEEKING? I CAN HAVE US
A DETAILED CRIB SHEET
IN HALF AN HOUR.

15:27.458 --> 15:31.041
GUYS, LOOK, ADMITTEDLY,
MY FIRST REACTION
WAS TO DUMP IT.

15:31.041 --> 15:35.208
BUT...YOU HEARD
PRINCIPAL GREEN. I MEAN,
THESE THINGS ARE A GAME.

15:35.208 --> 15:37.041
AND AS WRONG
AS CHEATING SOUNDS,

15:37.041 --> 15:39.542
I THOUGHT I WOULD
BRING IT UP TO YOU
GUYS FOR DISCUSSION.

15:39.542 --> 15:41.750
OK, MORALS TO DAWSON.
COME IN, DAWSON.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.250
THIS IS WRONG.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.417

REQUIRED TO TAKE IT,

QUALIFY FOR A NATIONAL
MERIT SCHOLARSHIP.

TOO BUSY GETTIN' THE CRAP

16:02.375 --> 16:05.083
IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO GO TO HARVARD.

OR IF A FAILED RELATIONSHIP
HAS PUT YOU THROUGH
THE EMOTIONAL RINGER,

16:12.917 --> 16:14.875
AND YOU JUST DON'T CARE
THESE DAYS.

16:14.875 --> 16:19.625
OR IF YOU'VE JUST BEEN
TOO DARN BUSY
GETTIN' BUSY.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.583
THE POINT IS, WE COULD
ALL USE IT FOR SOMETHING.

16:25.750 --> 16:28.250

ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
LET'S TAKE OUR SEATS.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.208

EXACTLY WHERE IT IS

IN AN ORDERLY FASHION.

ANY SHARP MOVEMENTS,
ALL RIGHT?

MY CHEST CAVITY.

19:14.333 --> 19:15.542
I THOUGHT THAT YOU GUYS
WORE PADS OUT THERE.

19:15.542 --> 19:18.542
YEAH, WELL,
I MUST BE WEARING
THE PLACEBO PADS.

19:18.542 --> 19:21.458
WELL, AT LEAST YOU CAN
MAINTAIN YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR
THROUGH ALL THIS.

19:21.458 --> 19:22.792
UNTIL IT GETS BEATEN
OUT OF ME, TOO.

19:22.792 --> 19:23.917

YOU WANT TO BE A QUITTER?

19:32.500 --> 19:35.000
GO RIGHT AHEAD.
BE A QUITTER.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.667
OK, WARD, UH,
I'M NOT BEAVER CLEAVER,

19:37.667 --> 19:39.834
AND WE'RE NOT
IN BLACK AND WHITE HERE.

19:39.834 --> 19:41.458
AND NO HALF-ASS
LAYMAN'S USE OF
REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY

19:41.458 --> 19:45.000
IS GONNA STOP ME FROM
PREVENTING MY CORPSE

19:45.000 --> 19:46.041
FROM BEING
CARRIED OFF THAT FIELD.

19:46.041 --> 19:47.542
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
MOCK THE SENTIMENT,

19:47.542 --> 19:48.583
BUT YOU CAN'T DENY
THE TRUTH.

19:48.583 --> 19:49.792
WHEN YOU QUIT SOMETHING,

19:49.792 --> 19:51.375
YOU'RE TELLING YOURSELF
THAT YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

OH, OK. SO WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING IS THAT, UH,

WILL BE OF INFINITE
VALUE LATER ON IN LIFE?

19:58.792 --> 20:00.166
MM-HMM.
AND THAT IF I QUIT NOW,

20:00.166 --> 20:01.375
I'LL MOST SURELY QUIT

20:01.375 --> 20:04.041
IN THE MORE IMPORTANT
CONTEST OF THE FUTURE?

20:04.041 --> 20:05.083
EXACTLY.

20:05.083 --> 20:05.834
YEAH, WELL,
I'M QUITTING.

20:05.834 --> 20:08.166
OK, SMART ASS,

20:08.166 --> 20:09.834
HOW ABOUT THIS
FOR A REASON?

20:09.834 --> 20:12.000
YOU CAUGHT THE BALL.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.625
NOW, CALL ME CORNY,
CALL ME SUPERSTITIOUS,

20:14.625 --> 20:16.458
BUT FATE TOSSED YOU
THAT BALL, JACK.

20:16.458 --> 20:17.917
WHO KNOWS WHY,
BUT IT DID.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.708
MAYBE YOU'RE MEANT TO BE
A WELL-KNOWN GAY ATHLETE

20:20.708 --> 20:22.333
WHO INSPIRES OTHERS
TO COME TO TERMS
WITH WHO THEY ARE.

20:22.333 --> 20:25.542
MAYBE YOU'RE MEANT
TO HELP THIS SCHOOL

20:25.542 --> 20:28.542
ACTUALLY WIN
A FEW GAMES AND DEVELOP
A SENSE OF MORALE...

20:28.542 --> 20:31.500
OR MAYBE THIS IS JUST
THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS

20:31.500 --> 20:33.834
MEETING SOMEONE ELSE
IN A SIMILAR SITUATION.

20:33.834 --> 20:35.417
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE REASON,

20:35.417 --> 20:37.542
BUT UNTIL YOU DO,
HANG ON TO THAT BALL.

20:37.542 --> 20:39.792
OH, THAT WAS CHEESIER
THAN YOUR FIRST RESPONSE.

20:39.792 --> 20:42.542
MMM.

20:45.375 --> 20:47.208
OW! COME ON.

20:47.208 --> 20:50.917
NEVER TALK BACK TO SOMEBODY
WHO COULD CUT OFF
YOUR AIR SUPPLY.

20:52.875 --> 20:55.041
HEY--

20:59.917 --> 21:01.917
YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TIME, DAWSON.

21:01.917 --> 21:02.583
IT'S GOTTA BE HERE
SOMEWHERE.

21:04.917 --> 21:05.667
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

21:05.667 --> 21:07.875
EVE...

21:07.875 --> 21:11.250
COULD YOU AT LEAST
PRETEND TO HELP ME
SAVE MY ASS?

21:11.250 --> 21:12.875
WELL...IT IS
A CUTE ASS, BUT...

21:12.875 --> 21:15.000
BUT WHAT?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.041
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
A CHANCE IN HELL

21:17.041 --> 21:18.583
OF FINDING WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

21:18.583 --> 21:19.667
HOW DO YOU
KNOW THAT, EVE?

21:19.667 --> 21:20.875
THE TEST WAS
ON THIS TABLE
ONE MINUTE.

21:20.875 --> 21:22.083
THE NEXT MINUTE,
IT'S GONE.

21:22.083 --> 21:23.208
OBVIOUSLY, IT HAS
TO HAVE GONE SOME--

21:23.208 --> 21:24.708
QUICK, DAWSON,
SOMEONE'S COMING.

21:27.125 --> 21:28.875

21:41.792 --> 21:43.708
[WHISPERING]
Question: what
would look better

21:43.708 --> 21:44.792
on my high-school
transcripts...

21:44.792 --> 21:47.125
A--cheating,

21:47.125 --> 21:49.542
B--possession of
stolen materials,

21:49.542 --> 21:50.875
C--breaking
and entering,

21:50.875 --> 21:52.667
or D--all
of the above?

21:52.667 --> 21:53.417
You're right, Dawson.

21:56.959 --> 21:59.458
ABOUT WHAT?

21:59.458 --> 22:00.917
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

22:00.917 --> 22:02.500
BESIDES, IF YOU REALLY
WANT THAT EXAM BACK,

22:02.500 --> 22:04.542
IT SHOULDN'T BE
TOO DIFFICULT.

22:04.542 --> 22:06.291
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:06.291 --> 22:08.875
IT DIDN'T DISAPPEAR,
DAWSON.

22:08.875 --> 22:11.625
SOMEBODY TOOK IT.

22:11.625 --> 22:13.417
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

22:13.417 --> 22:14.417
CALL IT FEMALE INTUITION.

22:16.834 --> 22:19.834
GOD, IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT COULD'VE BEEN
ANYBODY.

22:19.834 --> 22:20.667
THERE WERE DOZENS
OF KIDS IN THAT ROOM

WENT OFF.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.834

WHAT WAS IN THE ENVELOPE?

22:29.708 --> 22:31.708

22:31.708 --> 22:34.792
WHO WOULD STEAL SOMETHING
THEY DIDN'T KNOW
THE VALUE OF?

22:34.792 --> 22:36.375
SEE MY POINT?

22:36.375 --> 22:37.792
FACE IT, DAWSON.

22:37.792 --> 22:39.917
IN THE PRIVACY
OF THEIR OWN ROOM,

22:39.917 --> 22:41.542
ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS

22:41.542 --> 22:45.000
IS RIGHT NOW

BETWEEN THE PAGES

22:45.000 --> 22:46.250
AND BREAKING THE SEAL.

22:54.000 --> 22:57.041
ONE MONTH INTO MY TENURE
HERE AS PRINCIPAL
AT CAPESIDE HIGH,

22:57.041 --> 22:59.875
AND I GOT A NATIONAL
CHEATING SCANDAL ON MY HANDS!

22:59.875 --> 23:02.083
LOOK, IT MAKES
NO DIFFERENCE

23:02.083 --> 23:03.875
WHETHER ONE OF YOU
TAKES THE FALL FOR THIS,

23:03.875 --> 23:05.041
OR YOU ALL
GO DOWN TOGETHER

23:05.041 --> 23:08.542
IN SOME SORT OF GRAND GESTURE
OF TEENAGE LOYALTY.

23:08.542 --> 23:10.542
BUT SOMEBODY BETTER FESS UP

23:10.542 --> 23:12.375
AND BETTER FESS UP SOON!

23:12.375 --> 23:14.875
OTHERWISE,
YOU ARE ALL EXPELLED!

OF BLACK-MARKET BOOTY

23:39.250 --> 23:40.792
DO YOU HAVE FOR US
TODAY, DAWSON?

23:40.792 --> 23:43.583
JUST HAPPENED TO FIND OUT
WHAT MICROSOFT WILL BE
TRADING AT TOMORROW?

23:43.583 --> 23:46.166
LOOK, I CALLED
YOU GUYS HERE
BECAUSE I WANTED

23:46.166 --> 23:48.583
TO GIVE YOU ALL--
TO GIVE US ALL--

23:48.583 --> 23:50.750
A CHANCE TO RECTIFY
THIS SITUATION.

23:50.750 --> 23:51.792
HOW?

23:51.792 --> 23:53.750
WHOEVER STOLE THE TEST
NEEDS TO GIVE IT BACK.

23:53.750 --> 23:55.750
WELL, WASN'T IT
ALREADY STOLEN,
DAWSON?

23:55.750 --> 23:58.250
I LOVE THE WAY THAT
THIS GIRL THINKS.

23:58.250 --> 24:00.291
LOOK, THE POINT IS,
IT'S MISSING.

24:00.291 --> 24:01.583
YESTERDAY IT WASN'T.

24:01.583 --> 24:04.208
SO WHAT'S THE HARM
IN JUST LETTING IT
BE LOST, DAWSON?

24:04.208 --> 24:06.417
I AGREE. WHOEVER
NEEDED IT WAS
NO MORE DESPERATE

24:06.417 --> 24:08.291
THAN THE REST OF US,
ONLY QUICKER.

24:08.291 --> 24:10.208
DOESN'T IT BOTHER ANYONE
WHAT THIS SAYS

24:10.208 --> 24:11.959
ABOUT OUR GROUP'S LEVEL
OF INTEGRITY?

24:11.959 --> 24:13.583
WELL, I THINK I SPEAK
FOR OUR GROUP

24:13.583 --> 24:15.583
WHEN I RESPOND
WITH A HEARTY "NO!"

24:15.583 --> 24:17.250
I'M STARTING TO FEEL

24:17.250 --> 24:18.542
LIKE SOME SORT OF
PSYCHOLOGICALLY ABUSED
LAB RAT.

24:18.542 --> 24:21.625
YOU'RE NOT
THE LAB RAT, JEN.
DAWSON IS.

24:21.625 --> 24:22.667
WATCH IT, JOEY.

24:26.458 --> 24:28.834
DAWSON, IF YOUR ROPE
WAS ANY MORE YANKED,
YOU'D BE A CHURCH BELL.

24:28.834 --> 24:30.750
JOEY, EVE HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

24:30.750 --> 24:33.333
OH, NO. IT'S TYPICAL
DAWSON LEERY BEHAVIOR

24:33.333 --> 24:34.542
TO OFFER YOUR FRIENDS
CONTRABAND.

24:34.542 --> 24:37.500
SHE DIDN'T TELL ME
TO DO ANYTHING
WITH THAT TEST.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.625
YOU ARE SO BLINDED
BY HER COVER-GIRL LOOKS,

24:39.625 --> 24:42.166
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
NOTICE IF SHE DID.

24:42.166 --> 24:43.834
I BET WHEN SHE OFFERED
YOU THAT TEST,

24:43.834 --> 24:46.333
YOU DIDN'T FIRE
ONE ETHICAL COMMENT
HER WAY, DID YOU?

24:46.333 --> 24:48.083
IT'S JUST YOUR FRIENDS
WHO HAVE TO SIT HERE
AND--

24:48.083 --> 24:51.166
AND SUFFER THROUGH
THE DAWSON LEERY
MORALITY PLAY.

24:57.291 --> 24:59.041
LOOK, I'M SORRY
I BROUGHT YOU ALL
INTO THIS,

24:59.041 --> 25:01.583
BUT ONE OF US
HAS TAKEN THIS CHARADE
TO ANOTHER LEVEL.

25:01.583 --> 25:04.750
HERE'S THE DEAL:
I'M GONNA LEAVE
MY LOCKER UNLOCKED.

25:04.750 --> 25:07.500

WILL PUT IT INSIDE
BY 5:30 TODAY.

AMONG US

25:10.625 --> 25:12.333
ALREADY LEFT
THE CRIME SCENE.

NOT GONNA RETURN
THAT THING NOW.

25:14.166 --> 25:15.375

NOT IN THE MOOD

25:37.000 --> 25:38.792
FOR SOME SORDID

KIND OF CUT THIS
THING SHORT...

25:40.000 --> 25:41.959

25:57.750 --> 25:58.917

THE FIRST THING THAT
I EVER GAVE TO YOU.

YOU'VE EVER GIVEN ME
IS IN THIS BOX.

MAYBE THIS IS

GOING TO BE

AND I INTEND ON DOING

26:15.667 --> 26:17.708

TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

26:20.250 --> 26:22.041

TO BE A PART OF IT,

26:22.041 --> 26:23.834
AND IF YOU CAN'T,
THEN YOU GET NOTHING.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.458
NOT EVEN MEMORIES?

26:27.458 --> 26:29.959
ESPECIALLY NOT THOSE.

26:29.959 --> 26:35.708

THOSE ARE THE TERMS,

26:55.875 --> 26:57.500

EVERYONE'S GOT ONE.

26:59.417 --> 27:02.417
REALLY? WHAT FOR?

27:02.417 --> 27:04.583
SOMETHING TO FOCUS ON,
TO TAKE YOUR MIND
OFF THE FACT

27:04.583 --> 27:06.291
THAT YOU'RE
ABOUT TO BE ANNIHILATED

27:06.291 --> 27:08.959
BY A 250-POUND LINEMAN
SNORTING FIRE AT YOU

27:08.959 --> 27:10.750
FROM THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE BALL.

27:10.750 --> 27:11.792
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

27:11.792 --> 27:13.000
SERIOUSLY, JACK.

27:13.000 --> 27:13.959
ANYTHING TO STOP
FROM THINKING.

27:13.959 --> 27:17.375
IN THIS SPORT,
THOUGHT EQUALS DEATH.

27:17.375 --> 27:18.917
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

27:18.917 --> 27:20.667
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

27:20.667 --> 27:21.667
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

27:21.667 --> 27:23.125
HELPING ME.
I DON'T KNOW--
I DON'T...

27:23.125 --> 27:25.625

27:25.625 --> 27:27.250
FIRST, I WANT TO WIN
FOOTBALL GAMES,

27:27.250 --> 27:30.375
AND WITHOUT YOUR MAGIC HANDS,
WE DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

27:30.375 --> 27:32.875
AND 2 IS...

27:34.583 --> 27:35.667
WELL...

27:35.667 --> 27:37.083
YOU--YOU'RE GAY, RIGHT?

27:37.083 --> 27:39.750
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE, LIKE,
A SECRET OR ANYTHING?

27:39.750 --> 27:40.291
NO.

27:40.291 --> 27:42.041
WHEW!

27:42.041 --> 27:44.417
WHY THE SUDDEN
INTEREST IN MY SEXUAL
ORIENTATION?

27:44.417 --> 27:46.542
UH, WELL...

27:46.542 --> 27:49.250

REALLY, OR A GODDESS.

27:52.959 --> 27:55.166
I DREAM ABOUT HER, JACK,
EVERY NIGHT, HEAVY DREAMS,

27:55.166 --> 27:57.959
ABOUT HER LIPS,
HER BREASTS, HER LEGS...

27:57.959 --> 28:00.542
IF SHE WOULD JUST
ALLOW ME NEAR HER

28:00.542 --> 28:03.208
TO SMELL HER SWEET SMELL,
MAYBE EVEN KISS ME

28:03.208 --> 28:05.166
OR TAKE ME IN HER ARMS--

28:05.166 --> 28:06.417
DELIVER ME
FROM SUFFERING FALSEHOOD!

28:06.417 --> 28:08.875
IT WOULD PROVE THAT
THERE WASN'T ANYTHING BAD

28:08.875 --> 28:10.959
OR--OR EMPTY-HEARTED
IN THIS WORLD THAT
COULDN'T BE CORRECTED.

28:10.959 --> 28:13.500
JUST SLOW DOWN.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.667
AH, IT'S NOTHING
A LITTLE BONFIRE
WON'T FIX.

29:16.583 --> 29:19.083
YOU SEE,
OUR FRIEND ANDIE...

29:19.083 --> 29:22.959
DECIDED THAT SHE
NEEDED TO CLEANSE ME
FROM HER LIFE

29:22.959 --> 29:25.917
TO MAINTAIN
HER SANITY.

29:25.917 --> 29:28.667
THE CASUALTIES
WERE THE CONTENTS
OF THIS BOX.

29:28.667 --> 29:28.959
BEHOLD--UNH!

29:31.417 --> 29:34.000
OH, HELLO, MR. DOCK.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.417
PACEY...

29:41.750 --> 29:42.750
HEY, JOE...

29:42.750 --> 29:43.375
YEAH?

29:43.375 --> 29:45.917
DO ME A FAVOR.

29:45.917 --> 29:47.583
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
GO HOME LIKE THIS.

29:47.583 --> 29:50.208
YOU THINK YOU COULD
CALL MY DAD AND TELL HIM
I'M HANGING HERE?

29:50.208 --> 29:52.959
YEAH.

30:04.291 --> 30:05.959
THAT'S MY GIRL.

30:21.375 --> 30:22.708
YOU'RE LIKE
A SAINT BERNARD,
DAWSON,

30:22.708 --> 30:26.667
LOYAL AND FAITHFUL
TO THE LAST.

30:26.667 --> 30:28.625
IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS,
I'M GONNA OPEN
THAT LOCKER

30:28.625 --> 30:29.708
AND PROVE YOU WRONG.

30:29.708 --> 30:31.667
HOW CAN YOU BE
SO CERTAIN?

30:33.291 --> 30:35.792
'CAUSE I BELIEVE
IN HAPPY ENDINGS, EVE.

30:35.792 --> 30:36.458
I ALWAYS HAVE.

30:36.458 --> 30:39.250
HAPPY ENDINGS.

30:39.250 --> 30:40.750
THERE'S
A CONTRADICTION
IN TERMS

30:40.750 --> 30:42.375
IF I EVER HEARD ONE.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.333
YOU'RE ENJOYING THIS.

30:45.333 --> 30:46.917
NOT REALLY. IT'S
JUST THAT MY TASTE
IN FAIRY TALES

30:46.917 --> 30:49.667
USUALLY RUNS
MORE TOWARDS...

30:49.667 --> 30:51.291
THE BROTHERS GRIMM.

30:51.291 --> 30:53.166
HOW CAN YOU BE
SO RELENTLESSLY CYNICAL?

30:53.166 --> 30:55.125
HOW CAN YOU BE
SO PROFOUNDLY NAIVE?

31:03.041 --> 31:06.333
ALL IS NOT LOST,
MY SWEET PRINCE.

31:06.333 --> 31:09.500
YOU KNOW WHAT,
EVE, JUST...

31:09.500 --> 31:11.500
LEAVE ME THE HELL
ALONE, OK?

31:11.500 --> 31:12.583
ARE YOU SURE?

31:12.583 --> 31:15.333
BET I CAN HELP YOU
GET THE TEST BACK.

31:15.333 --> 31:17.458
HOW?

31:18.917 --> 31:20.125
BY TELLING YOU
WHO TOOK IT.

31:22.542 --> 31:24.542
I'M LISTENING.

31:25.333 --> 31:27.667
TELL ME
WHO YOU THINK IT IS.

31:30.708 --> 31:32.708
I DON'T KNOW.

31:32.708 --> 31:33.959
YES, YOU DO.

31:33.959 --> 31:35.875
WHOEVER YOU WERE
JUST THINKING OF,

31:35.875 --> 31:37.250
THAT'S THE THIEF.

31:37.250 --> 31:38.375
[SCOFFS]
IT'S THAT SIMPLE?

31:38.375 --> 31:40.500
IT IS.

31:40.500 --> 31:41.917
SIMPLE AND OBVIOUS.

31:44.583 --> 31:47.542
I DON'T BUY IT.
IF THERE'S ONE THING
THAT I'VE LEARNED

31:47.542 --> 31:49.208
FROM THOSE STUPID
PSAT PREP BOOKS,

31:49.208 --> 31:52.166
IT'S THAT
THE MOST OBVIOUS CHOICE
IS USUALLY THE WRONG ONE.

31:52.166 --> 31:55.875
WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT STANDARDIZED
TESTS HERE, DAWSON.

31:55.875 --> 31:58.125
TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR YEARBOOK.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.041
IT'S A CRYSTAL BALL.

32:00.041 --> 32:01.542
THE ONES MOST
LIKELY TO SUCCEED
USUALLY SUCCEED.

32:01.542 --> 32:06.041
AND THE ONE MOST
LIKELY TO WIND UP
IN A CHAIN GANG...

32:06.041 --> 32:08.542
USUALLY HAS
SOME ROCK-BREAKING
IN HIS FUTURE.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.875
WELCOME
TO THE REAL WORLD,
DAWSON,

32:11.875 --> 32:14.542
WHERE THE FIRST
PERSON TO STAB YOU
IN THE BACK

32:14.542 --> 32:15.208
IS YOUR BEST FRIEND.

32:28.208 --> 32:31.250
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
INSPECTOR GET-A-CLOUSEAU.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.750
WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO THESE PARTS

32:32.750 --> 32:35.041
AT THIS LATE HOUR?

32:35.041 --> 32:36.250
YOU'RE DRUNK.

32:36.250 --> 32:37.208
YOU'RE QUICK.

32:37.208 --> 32:38.583
IT'S THE NIGHT
BEFORE THE PSAT, PACEY.

32:38.583 --> 32:39.291
WHY ARE YOU DRINKING?

32:39.291 --> 32:40.917
I DON'T NEED TO STUDY.

32:40.917 --> 32:43.458
I MEAN,
I GOT THE TEST, RIGHT?

32:46.291 --> 32:48.208
IF YOU HAVE IT,
GIVE IT BACK.

32:48.208 --> 32:50.792
OH, I WISH I DID,
HOMBRE.

32:50.792 --> 32:53.667
I MEAN,
I REALLY WISH I DID.

32:53.667 --> 32:55.125
BUT I DON'T.

32:55.125 --> 32:56.959
I DON'T.
IT'S NOT HERE.

32:56.959 --> 32:59.208
IT'S NOT AT HOME
UNDER MY BED
WITH MY PLAYBOYS.

32:59.208 --> 33:02.417
IT IS NOWHERE
TO BE FOUND.

33:02.417 --> 33:04.291
PACEY,
WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS
FOR 16 YEARS,

33:04.291 --> 33:05.250
AND I'M NOT STUPID.

33:07.166 --> 33:09.708
FRIENDS, HUH?

33:09.708 --> 33:11.125
FRIENDS.

33:11.125 --> 33:14.250
YOU KNOW,
THAT WORD "FRIENDS"...

33:14.250 --> 33:16.375
IT'S AN INTERESTING WORD.

33:16.375 --> 33:19.500
IT IMPLIES THAT
YOU WOULD ACTUALLY
BELIEVE YOUR FRIEND

33:19.500 --> 33:21.458
WHEN HE'S TELLING
YOU SOMETHING.

33:21.458 --> 33:22.667
WHEN THEY TELL ME
THE TRUTH.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.542
WHEN HE'S TELL--

33:24.542 --> 33:25.625
HA HA!

33:25.625 --> 33:26.750
OH, HA HA!

33:26.750 --> 33:27.708
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I FIND

33:27.708 --> 33:30.125
SO VERY AMUSING
ABOUT THIS SITUATION?

33:30.125 --> 33:32.166
I MEAN, WHAT I THINK
IS SO REALLY, REALLY RICH

33:32.166 --> 33:33.417
ABOUT ALL THIS

33:33.417 --> 33:35.708
IS THAT YOU YOURSELF WERE
CAPABLE OF STEALING THIS TEST.

33:35.708 --> 33:38.708
ALL RIGHT, YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
YOU DIDN'T THROW
THAT TEST AWAY.

33:38.708 --> 33:39.834
YOU DIDN'T GIVE IT
BACK TO EVE.

33:39.834 --> 33:41.500
YOU BROUGHT THE TEST TO US!

33:41.500 --> 33:43.458
NO. I WANTED TO CONSULT
THE PEOPLE I TRUSTED

33:43.458 --> 33:45.250
TO DETERMINE
WHAT THE BEST THING
WAS TO DO.

33:45.250 --> 33:47.250
I NEVER THOUGHT
THAT ANYONE
WOULD BE SO WEAK

33:47.250 --> 33:51.000
OR SO SELF-MOTIVATED
TO ACTUALLY SWIPE IT.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.417
WEAK AND SELF-MOTIVATED, HUH?

33:53.417 --> 33:57.000
NOW, WHICH ONE
OF THOSE 2 COLORFUL
ADJECTIVES WOULD I BE?

33:57.000 --> 33:57.708
YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE, PACEY.

33:57.708 --> 34:01.875
YES, I AM, DAWSON.

34:01.875 --> 34:03.834
AND SO ARE YOU.

34:03.834 --> 34:05.750
YOU, DAWSON LEERY,

34:05.750 --> 34:07.417
ARE A SELF-RIGHTEOUS
SON OF A BITCH

34:07.417 --> 34:10.500
WHO CARES MORE ABOUT
HIS ROSE-COLORED DEFUNCT
1950s BELIEF SYSTEM

34:10.500 --> 34:12.833
THAN THE PEOPLE
WHO FAIL TO LIVE UP
TO IT, HUH?

34:12.833 --> 34:14.083
INTERESTING CHOICE
OF WORDS,

34:14.083 --> 34:16.125
COMING FROM
A SMUG, COLD-HEARTED
SON OF A BITCH

34:16.125 --> 34:17.917
WHO JUST DUMPED
HIS GIRLFRIEND
AFTER SHE BEGGED

34:17.917 --> 34:19.125
AND PLEADED
FOR AN OUNCE
OF SYMPATHY!

34:19.125 --> 34:21.375
AT LEAST I DIDN'T SEND
HER FATHER TO PRISON.

34:21.375 --> 34:22.708
NO. YOU JUST MADE
HER GO CRAZY.

34:28.542 --> 34:29.708
AHH...

34:31.041 --> 34:34.083
PACE--DAWSON,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:34.083 --> 34:36.000
IT'S MY FAULT. I'M SORRY.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.875
DAWSON, THIS
HAS GOT TO STOP.

34:41.667 --> 34:43.708
ARE YOU OK?

34:55.250 --> 34:57.125
HEY...

34:57.125 --> 34:58.458
BROUGHT YOU
A PEPSI.

34:58.458 --> 35:00.250
NO, THANKS.
I'M NOT THIRSTY.

35:00.250 --> 35:02.750
IT'S FOR YOUR LIP,
MORON, IN LIEU OF ICE.

35:03.959 --> 35:04.750
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE THOUGHT I TOOK IT.

35:04.750 --> 35:07.166
SO WHAT, PACEY?

35:07.166 --> 35:09.542
I THOUGHT IF I'D EARNED
ANYONE'S RESPECT,

35:09.542 --> 35:11.667
IT WAS DAWSON'S.

35:11.667 --> 35:13.667
I MEAN, IF THE GUY
WHO KNOWS YOU BETTER
THAN ANYBODY ON EARTH

35:13.667 --> 35:14.375
THINKS YOU'RE A LOSER,
THEN MAYBE--

35:14.375 --> 35:16.166
THEN MAYBE
YOU ARE ONE?

35:17.166 --> 35:18.333
COME ON.

35:18.333 --> 35:19.708
I MEAN, I'VE THOUGHT
YOU WERE A LOSER
FOR YEARS,

35:19.708 --> 35:20.750
BUT YOU'VE NEVER
BELIEVED ME.

35:26.500 --> 35:27.708
IT'S JUST...

35:27.708 --> 35:30.125
YOU KNOW, WHEN DOES
A PERSON START BELIEVING

35:30.125 --> 35:32.500
THE GENERAL CONSENSUS
ABOUT THEMSELVES?

35:32.500 --> 35:34.667
WHEN IT'S RIGHT.

35:38.125 --> 35:41.583
DO ME A FAVOR.
WHAT?

35:41.583 --> 35:44.333
WOULD YOU TELL
YOUR FRIEND DAWSON
THAT I'M INNOCENT?

35:44.333 --> 35:46.208
I MEAN,
HE'LL BELIEVE YOU.

35:46.208 --> 35:47.917
MY  FRIEND?

35:47.917 --> 35:49.125
LOOK, HE'S
YOUR FRIEND, TOO.

35:49.125 --> 35:51.125
AND YOU KNOW
AS WELL AS I DO

35:51.125 --> 35:53.333
THAT HE'S SOMEWHERE
RIGHT NOW SULKING
OVER THE GRAVITY

35:53.333 --> 35:54.625
OF HIS WRONGFUL
ACCUSATION.

35:54.625 --> 35:55.959
OH, GOOD.

35:55.959 --> 35:58.583
LET HIM STEW
IN HIS OWN PRIDE
FOR A WHILE.

35:58.583 --> 36:00.291
WE'RE ALL GUILTY
OF THAT.

36:00.291 --> 36:01.792
HEY, I'D NEVER
ACCUSE HIM OF CHEATING.

36:01.792 --> 36:03.375
YEAH, WELL,
I'M PRETTY SURE
HE WOULD NEVER TAKE

36:03.375 --> 36:04.458
THE FIRST SWING
AT YOU.

36:04.458 --> 36:06.500
HE STARTED
THAT WHOLE THING.

36:06.500 --> 36:08.792
I'M NOT GETTING
INTO THIS.

36:12.875 --> 36:15.333
OK. SO, TELL ME...

36:15.333 --> 36:16.375
WHAT?

36:16.375 --> 36:18.500
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENED TO THAT TEST?

36:21.000 --> 36:22.959
I DON'T KNOW.

36:22.959 --> 36:25.166
AND TO BE
HONEST, I...

36:25.166 --> 36:26.667
I DON'T WANT
TO KNOW.

36:26.667 --> 36:29.875
YOU KNOW, THERE
ARE CERTAIN THINGS
IN LIFE YOU JUST...

36:29.875 --> 36:32.000
YOU'RE BETTER OFF
NOT KNOWING,

36:32.000 --> 36:35.625
CERTAIN THINGS
THAT YOU WISH
YOU NEVER KNEW,

36:35.625 --> 36:38.542
NEVER ASKED,
AND, UM...

36:38.542 --> 36:40.250
NEVER SAW.

36:41.083 --> 36:42.917
OK, SO TELL ME HONESTLY...

36:44.708 --> 36:46.166
DOES IT LOOK
THAT BAD?

36:46.166 --> 36:49.000
ON YOUR FACE,
ANY RECONSTRUCTIVE
SURGERY WHATSOEVER

36:49.000 --> 36:50.291
IS A DEFINITE
IMPROVEMENT.

36:54.166 --> 36:55.792
[LAUGHS]

37:04.959 --> 37:06.583
DID YOU GET IT BACK?

37:11.250 --> 37:15.000
NOT EXACTLY.
WHAT HAPPENED?

37:15.000 --> 37:16.458
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN
SITTING HERE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT.

37:18.750 --> 37:21.000
AND?

37:21.000 --> 37:23.291
THE ONLY THING
I CAN COME UP
WITH IS YOU, EVE.

37:23.291 --> 37:25.041
YOU HAPPENED TO ME.

37:25.041 --> 37:28.083
YOU AND
THAT STUPID TEST.

37:29.875 --> 37:32.250
WHICH ONE OF US
GAVE YOU THE BLACK EYE?

37:32.250 --> 37:34.083
LOOK, EVE, I ACCEPT
MY BLAME IN THIS,

37:34.083 --> 37:36.000
BUT DON'T EVEN
TRY TO TELL ME
THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW

37:36.000 --> 37:38.500
WHAT GIVING ME
THAT TEST WOULD DO.

37:38.500 --> 37:41.083
LOOK, IF CRAFTING ME
AS THE VILLAIN IN
YOUR LITTLE MYSTERY

37:41.083 --> 37:43.417
IS WHAT IT TAKES
FOR YOU TO SLEEP
AT NIGHT...

37:43.417 --> 37:45.000
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.583
THE FACT IS, WE'RE
ALL CRIMINALS,
DAWSON,

37:47.583 --> 37:49.208
IN ONE WAY
OR ANOTHER.

37:49.208 --> 37:51.417
IT'S JUST
THE STUPID ONES
WHO GET CAUGHT.

37:58.917 --> 37:59.792
NICE KNOWING YOU, EVE.

37:59.792 --> 38:03.750
HA! IS THAT
HOW IT WORKS?

38:03.750 --> 38:05.875
SOMEONE OFFERS YOU
A VIEW OF HUMAN NATURE

38:05.875 --> 38:08.083
THAT'S EVEN
REMOTELY TRUTHFUL,

38:08.083 --> 38:09.959
AND YOU JUST WALK
AWAY FROM THEM?

38:11.583 --> 38:13.750
IT TERRIFIES YOU,
DOESN'T IT?

38:13.750 --> 38:16.458
THAT WHOLESOME
DAWSON LEERY
COULD BE

38:16.458 --> 38:18.333
SO OVERWHELMINGLY
ATTRACTED

38:18.333 --> 38:20.834
TO SOMEONE
SO FLAWED...

38:20.834 --> 38:23.083
SO REAL.

38:29.250 --> 38:30.291
EVE, THE PURPOSE
OF OUR SPENDING TIME TOGETHER

38:30.291 --> 38:33.208
WAS TO GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER.

38:34.458 --> 38:36.166
YOU KNOW WHAT?

38:36.166 --> 38:39.625
NOW THAT I KNOW YOU...

38:39.625 --> 38:40.458
I DON'T REALLY LIKE YOU.

38:57.166 --> 38:58.333
Cheerleaders:
...CHICKEN?

38:58.333 --> 39:00.500
HOW LOOSE IS YOUR GOOSE?

39:00.500 --> 39:02.667
SO COME ON,
ALL YOU MINUTEMEN,

39:02.667 --> 39:04.083
UH! AND SHAKE

39:04.083 --> 39:05.667
YOUR CABOOSE.

39:09.125 --> 39:10.291
PARKER, COME ON.

39:10.291 --> 39:11.834
MOVE YOUR TONGUE
FROM THE TURF.

39:11.834 --> 39:13.333
I NEED SOME WORDS
OF ENCOURAGEMENT.

39:13.333 --> 39:14.708
WELL...
SURE THING.

39:14.708 --> 39:16.000
HOW'S YOUR RIBS?

39:16.000 --> 39:17.708
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I CAN STILL BREATHE,
BUT THEN AGAIN,

39:17.708 --> 39:19.375
PRACTICE ISN'T OVER YET.

39:19.375 --> 39:21.959
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE!
PUT YOUR HELMETS ON!

39:21.959 --> 39:23.417
McPHEE, YOU'RE FIRST
IN THE CHUTE.

39:23.417 --> 39:25.333
YOU GOT YOUR MANTRA?

39:25.333 --> 39:26.708
WHAT IS IT?

39:26.708 --> 39:27.125
FUG.

39:27.125 --> 39:28.750
FUG?

39:28.750 --> 39:31.041
UH-HUH...F-U-G.

39:31.041 --> 39:33.250
IT'S THE ONLY WORD
I GOT IN MY HEAD
RIGHT NOW.

39:33.250 --> 39:35.500
FUG. FUG.

39:35.500 --> 39:36.583
FUG!

39:36.583 --> 39:39.041
THEN GO WITH IT.

39:39.041 --> 39:39.500
ALL RIGHT.

39:44.917 --> 39:48.291
FUG. FUG.

39:48.291 --> 39:50.041
OH, FUG.

39:50.041 --> 39:51.542
[WHISTLES]

39:51.542 --> 39:53.333
FUG!

40:27.333 --> 40:29.291
ALL RIGHT, MAN!
WAY TO GO!

40:30.917 --> 40:33.250
WAY TO GO!

40:33.250 --> 40:34.375
THANKS, COACH.

40:34.375 --> 40:35.792
GOOD JOB!
YEAH, BABY!
WHOO!

40:35.792 --> 40:37.083
WAY TO GO!

40:37.083 --> 40:38.875
WHOO!

40:38.875 --> 40:40.542
UNREAL!

40:42.000 --> 40:43.959
FUG...

40:44.917 --> 40:46.875
FUG...

40:48.708 --> 40:50.708
FUG! FUG!

40:50.708 --> 40:51.917
WHAT THE...

40:51.917 --> 40:52.959
FUG!

40:57.166 --> 41:00.208
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

41:01.667 --> 41:06.166
TODAY'S PSAT TEST
WILL BE 2 1/2 HOURS LONG.

41:06.166 --> 41:08.166
AS YOU KNOW,
THERE ARE 5 SECTIONS:

41:08.166 --> 41:11.166
2 VERBAL, 2 MATHEMATICS,

41:11.166 --> 41:13.834
AND ONE WRITING.

41:13.834 --> 41:16.291
THERE WILL BE
ONE 15-MINUTE BREAK.

41:16.291 --> 41:18.125
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?

41:18.125 --> 41:20.125
ALL RIGHT.

41:20.125 --> 41:21.125
YOU PEOPLE HAVE 30 MINUTES
TO COMPLETE--

41:21.125 --> 41:23.250
[CHAIR SLIDES]

41:24.000 --> 41:26.375
CAN I HELP YOU,
MR. LEERY?

41:26.375 --> 41:28.792
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

41:30.500 --> 41:32.417
IT'S A LONG STORY.

41:40.208 --> 41:41.041
OK. IF THERE'S
NO ONE ELSE...

41:41.041 --> 41:42.917
[CHAIR SLIDES]

41:50.500 --> 41:52.291
I LEFT THE OVEN ON.

42:11.667 --> 42:13.000
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

42:13.000 --> 42:14.208
AH, IT'S THOSE
ANALOGIES, MAN.

42:14.208 --> 42:15.250
THEY'RE KILLER.

42:16.667 --> 42:18.000
REMIND ME WHY WE
JUST DID THAT AGAIN?

42:18.000 --> 42:21.208
BECAUSE IF WE'RE
GONNA BEAT THE CRAP
OUT OF EACH OTHER,

42:21.208 --> 42:21.792
IT SHOULD AT LEAST
BE OVER A CHICK.

42:37.041 --> 42:39.250
YOU MAY BEGIN.
