WEBVTT

00:02.236 --> 00:03.637
Go, go, go, go, go!
They have the package.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.076
(screams)

00:09.543 --> 00:10.778
(panting)

00:10.811 --> 00:13.114
I'm an American citizen.

00:13.147 --> 00:13.814
Don't let him do this!
Move.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.283
Or I will shoot through you.

00:20.154 --> 00:20.954
He's dead.

00:20.988 --> 00:21.889
PORTER:
CIA has their eye on you.

00:21.922 --> 00:23.791
Any idea why?
MADANI: They told us

00:23.824 --> 00:25.793
we were targeting
a Somali national that night.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.695
GALLO: Instead we get
an American soldier.

00:27.728 --> 00:28.729
His name is Davis Goundry.

00:28.762 --> 00:29.730
He's listed as killed in action

00:29.763 --> 00:30.998
in 2014.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.766
PORTER: You think I don't notice
you taking those pills?

00:32.800 --> 00:33.734
The doctor said "as needed,"

00:33.767 --> 00:35.336
and I would never take them
when I'm flying.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.737
HASKINS:
Jimmy Kam's been captured

00:36.770 --> 00:37.705
along with Sergeant Hendrix.

00:37.738 --> 00:40.074
The Delta Force team leader
for your bird

00:40.108 --> 00:41.275
will be Sergeant Coogan.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.743
My name is Khalid Samatar.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.512
I'm the man
who has your soldiers.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.779
I will release them

00:45.813 --> 00:48.216
in exchange
for 50 ISIS prisoners.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.718
You have ten days
to meet my demands.

00:50.751 --> 00:51.819
Goundry had a domino, too.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.254
We'll be flying
a load of antibiotics

00:53.287 --> 00:54.255
into a refugee camp.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.590
Now, a successful drop
will not only save lives,

00:56.624 --> 00:57.825
but it will be the next step

00:57.858 --> 01:00.561
in bringing back
Sergeants Kam and Hendrix.

01:06.334 --> 01:07.701
The Puntland government
is permitting us

01:07.735 --> 01:09.503
two Black Hawks for the mission,

01:09.537 --> 01:11.339
along with one Reaper drone
to give us an eye in the sky.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.107
HASKINS: You'll
take the C-17

01:13.141 --> 01:14.375
to a forward operating base

01:14.408 --> 01:16.544
the day after tomorrow
and stage out of there.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.180
The antibiotic delivery will
be split between the helos.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.649
You'll each fly to a different
entrance of the refugee camp.

01:21.682 --> 01:22.883
Better odds that way.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.119
The bandits in the area
are heavily armed.

01:25.153 --> 01:27.221
You should be prepared
to engage.

01:27.255 --> 01:30.158
A successful delivery means
Puntland reopens its airspace.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.359
It's our first step

01:31.392 --> 01:33.227
in finding and exfiling
our POWs.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.395
MADANI:
Once we've opened the airspace,

01:34.428 --> 01:36.530
what's step two?

01:36.564 --> 01:38.166
We're working on that.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.201
For those who are about to
deploy, I want to remind you

01:40.234 --> 01:41.835
to complete your Soldier
Readiness packets.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.138
Take the time
to get your affairs in order.

01:44.172 --> 01:45.673
Check in with mental health,

01:45.706 --> 01:47.175
the chaplain, tie up loose ends.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.476
As always,

01:48.509 --> 01:50.311
we treat each deployment
like it could be our last

01:50.344 --> 01:52.246
while praying it's not.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.414
All right?

01:53.447 --> 01:54.515
Let's go.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.386
I want you to get working
on a scenario for step two.

01:58.419 --> 01:59.553
We need to get ahead of this.

01:59.587 --> 02:02.423
Roger that, sir.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.258
Here we go.
First time back out

02:04.292 --> 02:06.194
since we went down
in a ball of fire.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.228
Not funny yet.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.562
Wasn't trying to be.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.264
I keep thinking
about the dominoes.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.333
So, first Davis Goundry has one,

02:12.366 --> 02:13.767
and then Khalid in the video.

02:13.801 --> 02:14.902
But didn't it seem

02:14.935 --> 02:16.504
like he wanted
somebody to see it?

02:16.537 --> 02:18.339
Maybe it was a message

02:18.372 --> 02:20.408
or a threat--
they're connected somehow.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.276
We can't talk about this here.
Not anymore.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.477
All right?

02:23.511 --> 02:25.279
The CIA has eyes on us.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.219
*

02:43.664 --> 02:46.367
(coughs)

02:56.310 --> 02:58.178
(grunts)

02:59.980 --> 03:02.250
(grunts, panting)

03:04.418 --> 03:05.786
CRANK:
Hey.

03:05.819 --> 03:06.987
I heard that hit you took.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.357
You okay? Jimmy!

03:09.390 --> 03:11.359
(gasps)

03:11.392 --> 03:13.193
I hear you. I'm okay.

03:15.263 --> 03:16.797
How long do you think
we traveled?

03:16.830 --> 03:18.366
Half hour? Maybe more?

03:18.399 --> 03:19.700
I don't know.
I think it was more.

03:19.733 --> 03:20.901
Damn it.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.237
We have no idea where we are.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.605
They don't know where we are.
They?

03:24.638 --> 03:26.707
Home. If they're even looking.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.342
They're looking.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.878
Hey.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.580
You have to believe
they're looking.

03:36.317 --> 03:39.453
Earth to Nora.
(men chanting)

03:39.487 --> 03:40.888
Sorry.

03:40.921 --> 03:44.325
Are you okay?

03:44.358 --> 03:46.260
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.895
What were you saying?

03:47.928 --> 03:50.464
I have to go sign
a bunch of paperwork

03:50.498 --> 03:52.400
for Jimmy's benefits
on Thursday,

03:52.433 --> 03:54.635
and I thought maybe
you'd come with me.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.337
I can't Thursday.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.972
What about one of
the other army wives?

03:59.006 --> 04:00.341
You're starting
to connect, right?

04:00.374 --> 04:02.910
Yeah.
They're sweet.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.678
You know, there's
a lot of really

04:04.712 --> 04:08.516
innovative slow-cooker
recipes.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.551
I would rather
have you there.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.855
I'm deploying, Jess.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.557
Day after tomorrow.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.025
For Jimmy?

04:18.058 --> 04:20.494
Jess, you know I can't
talk about that.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.630
Come on.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.002
Sergeant Darzi tells me

04:29.036 --> 04:30.037
you're planning on
flying this mission

04:30.070 --> 04:31.872
on 3/4 of a tank.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.006
That's right.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.708
You want to explain that?

04:34.742 --> 04:37.711
(exhales)

04:37.745 --> 04:40.314
We're gonna be landing inside
the camp gates,

04:40.348 --> 04:42.316
between these two buildings.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.084
Anything goes wrong, we need
to be fast and furious

04:44.117 --> 04:45.719
and precise to get out.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.521
Now, with the weight
of your team's gear,

04:47.555 --> 04:49.523
I'm concerned we're not
gonna have enough torque.

04:49.557 --> 04:51.692
We got to lose pounds someplace.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.093
Fuel's the answer.
Wrong.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.529
We need contingency
in case we got to reroute.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.965
We'll have 20%.
That is not enough.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.300
Well, I'm flight lead.
Fuel load's my call.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.537
What, are you spooked
about going back out there?

05:03.571 --> 05:04.938
That's what this is?

05:04.972 --> 05:08.342
You forget you're talking
to a commissioned officer?

05:08.376 --> 05:10.378
I don't get spooked,
Sergeant.

05:10.411 --> 05:13.814
Anything goes wrong
on the ground, Captain,

05:13.847 --> 05:15.516
my team's gonna
handle that.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.885
We'll get you the time you'll
need for a safe takeoff

05:17.918 --> 05:19.453
with a full tank, trust me.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.054
Well, that's
just it, Coogan,

05:21.088 --> 05:22.956
With you, trust is hard.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.059
* You wake up someday
and you realize... *

05:26.093 --> 05:28.796
All right, roger that.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.998
Like you said,
your call, sir.

05:35.869 --> 05:39.072
JIMMY (speaking Arabic):
Allahumma...

05:39.106 --> 05:41.909
innaka afuwwun kareemun,

05:41.942 --> 05:44.578
tuhibbul afwa
fa'fu annaa...

05:46.680 --> 05:49.917
...waghfir lana warhamna...
Hey, what are you doing?

05:49.950 --> 05:51.084
Have you lost your damn mind?

05:51.118 --> 05:52.486
...anta mawlana fansurna

05:52.520 --> 05:54.855
alal qawmil kafireen...
Jimmy!

05:54.888 --> 05:58.125
Rabbana aatina
fiddunya hasatan,

05:58.158 --> 06:01.662
wa fil akhirati hasanatan,

06:01.695 --> 06:04.364
wa qina athabannar.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.144
(helicopter flies overhead)

06:29.990 --> 06:32.693
GALLO:
It's been five days.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.994
We've heard the helos,

06:34.027 --> 06:35.596
so we know they're
looking for us.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.631
But we are all
out of flares.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.834
And this is the one place

06:40.868 --> 06:42.470
the army knows we were.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.337
I'm fine.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.710
The prisoner was living here.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.646
MADANI:
There's a bedroll
in the corner.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.648
This wasn't just
a pick-up site.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.049
Maybe there are some supplies.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.120
Madani...

07:00.153 --> 07:01.889
I'm fine.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.924
I'm fine!
Rest. Rest.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.626
It doesn't matter
how tough you are

07:05.659 --> 07:06.927
if you end up dead.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.500
GALLO:
What is that?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.606
I think it's a coaster.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.776
There's no sign
of a struggle in here.

07:22.810 --> 07:23.977
Prisoner didn't resist.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.979
Maybe he was expecting them.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.916
That's why they put
a bag over his head?

07:28.949 --> 07:31.184
There's bullet holes
in the ceiling.

07:33.921 --> 07:36.056
And nowhere else.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.258
The night of the mission,

07:38.291 --> 07:40.794
they weren't shooting
to kill in here.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.996
They were putting on a show.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.532
Trying to make us think
it was an insurgent

07:44.565 --> 07:46.834
when, really,
it was an American.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.136
It must have been bad
for the CIA to work this hard

07:49.169 --> 07:50.504
to cover it up.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.506
And even worse for them
if we found out.

07:55.008 --> 07:58.111
Thought you did
your checklist already.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.112
So I'm doing it again.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.781
You finish your
readiness packet?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.816
The paperwork, yeah.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.652
If we're talking about
tying up loose ends

08:04.685 --> 08:07.821
before we go...

08:07.855 --> 08:10.190
I tracked down
Davis Goundry's sister.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.526
I'm gonna go talk to her.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.927
Look,

08:13.961 --> 08:15.729
we have to be more careful now.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.164
How, exactly,

08:17.197 --> 08:18.599
did you find her?

08:18.632 --> 08:19.900
Just basic online stuff.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.769
Could have been looking
for a camp friend.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.737
(chuckles)

08:23.771 --> 08:26.574
You don't strike me as
a color wars kind of girl.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.108
She lives 45 minutes away.

08:28.141 --> 08:32.012
Maybe she can tell us something
about Davis Goundry.

08:32.045 --> 08:35.048
Like who he was or
why he was over there.

08:35.082 --> 08:38.285
Well, if the CIA finds out
we're looking into Goundry,

08:38.318 --> 08:39.620
we are off this mission.

08:39.653 --> 08:42.189
Or worse, Madani...
I'm careful.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.291
But I'm gonna go talk
to her before we deploy.

08:44.324 --> 08:47.561
If we die out there,
which we might...

08:47.595 --> 08:50.063
(sighs)

08:50.097 --> 08:51.765
Well, I'm not gonna have
another chance, am I?

08:51.799 --> 08:55.002
Stop saying the word "die."

08:56.236 --> 08:58.572
You feel it, too?

08:58.606 --> 09:00.007
First time back out there?

09:02.375 --> 09:04.344
I'm your supervisor.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.679
Talking with you
about my feelings

09:05.713 --> 09:07.547
isn't part
of my job description.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.255
Yes, sir.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.693
Things have
to be different.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.996
We're home now, and
they are watching us.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.231
You know that.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.775
* I used to watch you
from the van *

09:36.043 --> 09:38.145
* It was your band...

09:45.185 --> 09:48.288
IAN (sighs):
How long you been up?

09:48.321 --> 09:51.124
A while.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.993
Couldn't sleep.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.962
I need to be ready
for this mission,

09:54.995 --> 09:58.098
stop thinking about
the last one, but I can't.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.600
Me neither.

10:02.903 --> 10:06.039
Have you checked in
with mental health?

10:06.073 --> 10:08.108
No.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.344
I got to ask--

10:13.681 --> 10:15.849
why not?

10:15.883 --> 10:17.184
I love you, babe,

10:17.217 --> 10:21.021
but... you can't really
understand this.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.156
Because I have not been
in combat?

10:23.190 --> 10:25.693
'Cause I'm just
a chairborne ranger?

10:25.726 --> 10:26.994
I didn't say that.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.196
No, but you were
thinking it.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.064
You're not wrong.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.033
Look, maybe just
think of psych

10:33.066 --> 10:35.335
as something
on the checklist, you know?

10:35.368 --> 10:38.338
Get in that cockpit
without any doubts.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.711
All right.

10:43.744 --> 10:44.945
All right.
All right.

10:44.978 --> 10:45.946
(laughing): Oh.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.214
Oh.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.936
That is not a thing
to joke about.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.237
You speak English.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.405
I work to learn, yes.

11:12.439 --> 11:13.841
I am Muslim.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.944
Not the same kind as you,
not even close, but...

11:16.977 --> 11:18.145
I do not believe you.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.346
What's your name?

11:19.379 --> 11:21.214
Dauud.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.716
Jimmy.

11:22.750 --> 11:28.188
Dauud... will you
please let me wash?

11:28.221 --> 11:30.390
I will see.

11:39.399 --> 11:42.002
CRANK:
I get it now.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.737
You're doing this so they'll
give you better treatment.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.038
Where's your damn pride?

11:45.072 --> 11:46.473
You're wrong.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.275
I am Muslim.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.077
Raised that way, at least.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.845
Never said so before.

11:51.879 --> 11:52.880
Yeah, well,

11:52.913 --> 11:54.447
what are you?

11:54.481 --> 11:56.216
(scoffs lightly)

11:56.249 --> 11:58.351
I haven't
practiced for years.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.353
Being here, now...

12:00.387 --> 12:05.125
asking God for help
is starting to make sense.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.160
Do you know how many people
have died because of your God?

12:07.194 --> 12:08.361
What these people
are doing here,

12:08.395 --> 12:10.197
it's not what Islam teaches.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.766
There's two billion Muslims
in the world

12:12.800 --> 12:15.068
who are nothing like this.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.304
I thought we were
on the same side.

12:17.337 --> 12:20.240
We are.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.009
I been praying
for the both of us.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.281
(school bell rings)

12:31.318 --> 12:32.452
Jess.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.822
Hey.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.123
It's been awhile.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.291
Hey, Ryan.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.460
Hudson said Max has been talking
about his dad a lot.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.495
I heard around school,
some of the other parents...

12:42.529 --> 12:44.998
He's MIA?

12:45.032 --> 12:47.835
Yeah. That's right.

12:47.868 --> 12:51.304
If you need anything, if Max
wants to come hang with Hudson,

12:51.338 --> 12:53.506
they've been talking
about that.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.843
Something about
Mario cards or...

12:55.876 --> 12:57.945
I don't even know
what that is.

12:57.978 --> 12:58.946
Yeah, I don't know.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.147
(both laugh)

13:01.481 --> 13:03.383
We're here for you.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.318
Come over.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.553
Dinner, if it'll help.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.390
Yeah.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.324
Yeah?

13:11.358 --> 13:14.027
It would be nice to talk.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.528
MAX:
Mom.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.230
(school bell rings)

13:17.264 --> 13:19.366
All right. I called
this meeting

13:19.399 --> 13:21.935
to discuss next steps
for the rescue mission.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.403
It's a bit of a catch-22,
gentlemen.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.105
Until we get
the airspace reopened,

13:25.138 --> 13:26.573
it'll be hard to gather
the intel we need

13:26.606 --> 13:28.976
for planning the
rescue of our POWs.

13:29.009 --> 13:32.145
Maybe we need to consider
what Khalid is asking.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.580
The prisoner exchange.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.348
The only response
I'm gonna dignify that with

13:35.382 --> 13:37.517
is a simple "no."
Will all due respect, ma'am...

13:37.550 --> 13:39.987
Full stop. It is not the policy
of the U.S. government...

13:40.020 --> 13:41.588
U.S. traded five prisoners
for Bowe Bergdahl.

13:41.621 --> 13:45.125
Would you like to review
the backlash on that, Captain?

13:45.158 --> 13:46.894
Totally different situation.
He was a deserter.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.296
Sergeants Kam and Hendrix
are anything but.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.931
THEA: The political cost
of a prisoner exchange,

13:50.964 --> 13:53.400
if it ever got leaked,
are unacceptable.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.135
And 50 of them? Not a chance.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.603
What's your goal here, ma'am?

13:56.636 --> 13:59.272
Getting them back or
having your agency look good?

13:59.306 --> 14:01.141
HASKINS: Lieutenant
Porter did some research

14:01.174 --> 14:03.176
on the list of prisoners
Khalid is asking for.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.644
Turns out they're connected.

14:04.677 --> 14:08.248
They were all detained
on the same day

14:08.281 --> 14:11.184
as part of a sweep
of a Somali ISIS cell in 2015.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.921
And the question is, how is
Khalid connected to these guys?

14:13.954 --> 14:16.356
The answer is
through his brother.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.191
I don't follow.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.060
Khalid's older brother
was caught up in that sweep.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.929
His name is on the list.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.563
Mustaf Issa.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.332
He uses his clan name
as his last name,

14:25.365 --> 14:28.335
unlike his brother, Khalid,
so no one caught on.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.238
You continue to impress me,
Lieutenant.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.306
Khalid's video
gives instructions

14:33.340 --> 14:35.008
on how to contact his middleman.

14:35.042 --> 14:38.045
We could negotiate.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.013
Talk him from 50
maybe even down to one.

14:40.047 --> 14:44.351
I'm betting his brother
is who he really cares about.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.119
And I think
you could agree, ma'am,

14:46.153 --> 14:48.355
that releasing one prisoner
is a lot more doable.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.090
Depends how dangerous
the one is.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.359
All of the other options
on the table are long shots.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.227
This is, by far,
the best one we've got.

14:54.261 --> 14:57.264
We'll explore it. Of course,
this is all for nothing

14:57.297 --> 14:59.199
unless you guys can get
the antibiotics in.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.334
We will.
Don't worry about that.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.570
It's my job to worry.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.305
(line ringing)

15:05.338 --> 15:07.607
Go for Gallo.
(voice mail beeps)

15:07.640 --> 15:10.978
Hey, just wanted to let you know
I'm running that errand

15:11.011 --> 15:13.213
we talked about. The sister.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.315
I'll circle back when I'm done.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.622
MALE GPS VOICE:
In 100 feet, turn left.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.327
MADANI:
Are you following me?

15:39.039 --> 15:40.640
MALE GPS VOICE:
Your destination,

15:40.673 --> 15:42.675
Thumbs Up Diner on your right.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.469
Bathroom?

16:09.502 --> 16:11.004
CLERK:
Right over there.

16:51.644 --> 16:52.612
Hi.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.414
Sorry for the mess.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.715
My kid.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.418
That is not your kid.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.619
You don't seem old enough.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.490
Someone tell you
that'll get you free waffles?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.392
(laughing):
'Cause it will.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.526
First time here?

17:06.559 --> 17:08.828
Yeah. I...

17:08.861 --> 17:10.663
I feel like
I recognize him.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.799
I'm also in the service.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.734
Was he based
at Fort Dabney?

17:14.767 --> 17:16.369
My brother, yeah.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.706
Uh, but he passed away
three years ago.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.075
I'm sorry.

17:22.109 --> 17:23.676
He basically raised
Christopher with me

17:23.710 --> 17:26.279
since I had him so young.

17:26.313 --> 17:29.349
These days I'm kind of
lost without him.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.284
Most days.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.753
Where was his
last deployment?

17:35.455 --> 17:37.290
I'm sorry. I'm just
trying to place him.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.292
All I know about
his last deployment

17:39.326 --> 17:41.394
is-is he didn't come back.

17:41.428 --> 17:42.762
They didn't give
you a report?

17:42.795 --> 17:46.433
Were you going
to order something?

17:48.135 --> 17:51.204
Deidre, I have a
friend out there,

17:51.238 --> 17:53.773
a good one, who
has gone missing

17:53.806 --> 17:55.408
and I can't help
but think that

17:55.442 --> 17:57.144
it has something to do
with your brother.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.712
Please.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.648
Whatever kind of conversation

18:01.681 --> 18:03.716
you're trying to have,

18:03.750 --> 18:05.852
it's not happening
in front of Christopher.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.355
He's been scarred enough
by losing his uncle.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.531
This is my number.

18:18.565 --> 18:19.732
In case you decide
you do want to talk.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.707
* Oh

18:27.740 --> 18:31.711
* Oh, oh...

18:31.744 --> 18:32.645
(line ringing)

18:32.679 --> 18:33.713
Go for Gallo.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.148
(voice mail beeps)

18:35.182 --> 18:37.150
* And tempting

18:37.184 --> 18:40.153
* All the steps to follow closer
right behind *

18:40.187 --> 18:41.254
* Is it only when you feel...

18:41.288 --> 18:43.256
(knock at door)
Come in.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.791
Hey.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.660
(chuckles)

18:47.694 --> 18:49.396
Hi.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.897
What's this?

18:50.930 --> 18:53.733
Max has been obsessed
with maps lately,

18:53.766 --> 18:56.436
so Jimmy and I had
this bright idea.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.839
I am just trying to finish it
for when he comes back.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.409
Came over to say I'm...

19:02.442 --> 19:05.845
sorry you found about the
deployment the way you did.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.480
Oh, I'm used to it.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.717
My marriage, with all the things
he can't tell me.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.919
* Oh, oh, oh...

19:12.952 --> 19:14.521
It's like this.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.956
Half of a thing.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.858
But that doesn't excuse it.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.627
Excuse what?

19:20.660 --> 19:23.596
How lost I would get
when he deployed.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.299
What do you do to prepare?

19:26.333 --> 19:27.900
Do you talk to Ian or...?

19:27.934 --> 19:29.836
Yeah, he and I just have
such different jobs.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.838
So Captain Gallo then?

19:31.871 --> 19:34.874
He's not much for talking
these days.

19:34.907 --> 19:37.844
* Oh, oh...

19:37.877 --> 19:40.347
The person I would
talk to is Ryan.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.849
Who's that?

19:42.882 --> 19:46.519
He's the father of one
of, um, Max's friends.

19:46.553 --> 19:50.857
He is a single
dad, a reporter,

19:50.890 --> 19:52.725
soccer coach.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.894
He slices oranges.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.730
(laughing):
Sure.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.732
So I started
talking to him.

19:59.766 --> 20:02.369
And then I
started confusing

20:02.402 --> 20:06.806
what I needed...
with what I wanted.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.741
* I will come to you blind...

20:08.775 --> 20:10.710
And we crossed a line.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.012
We stopped.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.647
Jess, look, you really don't
have to explain yourself to me.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.649
Yes, I do.

20:16.683 --> 20:21.388
Because all I want
to do is call him

20:21.421 --> 20:23.790
or see him or laugh or cry

20:23.823 --> 20:26.526
or scream or be human

20:26.559 --> 20:28.761
for a few seconds,

20:28.795 --> 20:31.831
and I know it is wrong.

20:31.864 --> 20:32.899
(quietly):
Jess.

20:32.932 --> 20:35.902
It's gonna be okay.

20:35.935 --> 20:39.339
* Hold me now...

20:39.372 --> 20:43.910
I told Jimmy about it before
you deployed the last time.

20:43.943 --> 20:47.880
And he said he needed time.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.950
And he wasn't sure if
he could trust me again.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.919
* Hold me

20:52.952 --> 20:55.054
* Hold me...

20:55.087 --> 20:57.690
When the helo
was going down,

20:57.724 --> 20:59.759
the only thing that
Jimmy took with him

20:59.792 --> 21:01.428
was that picture
of you and Max.

21:01.461 --> 21:04.997
* Hold...

21:05.031 --> 21:07.834
That is all that matters.
Okay?

21:11.671 --> 21:13.440
You know, what
I just told you

21:13.473 --> 21:14.441
was classified, right?

21:14.474 --> 21:16.943
Wow.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.845
You have got problems.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.980
I know.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.916
I'm actually gonna go
see someone about it.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.829
You got a fever, Madani.

21:36.863 --> 21:39.966
MADANI: I think
the wound's infected.

21:39.999 --> 21:44.003
Nah, you're gonna
be all right.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.839
You know that letter
they make us write?

21:46.873 --> 21:47.840
Part of our package,

21:47.874 --> 21:49.842
in case we don't
come back home?

21:49.876 --> 21:51.444
I never wrote one.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.514
I wish I had.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.718
I got the same letter
in my packet

21:58.751 --> 21:59.919
the last five years.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.754
To who?

22:01.788 --> 22:04.491
My mom.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.993
She makes a big to-do
every time I deploy.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.562
Sends me a meal,
and it's all boxed up.

22:09.596 --> 22:12.799
I FaceTime her and
the rest of my fam,

22:12.832 --> 22:14.734
and they watch me eat,
and I watch them.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.869
You know, it's like
we're all together.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.438
(chuckles)

22:18.471 --> 22:20.006
My mom gives
the same speech.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.674
Tell me the speech.
(chuckles)

22:21.708 --> 22:24.877
We're a military family,

22:24.911 --> 22:28.648
so you can imagine.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.818
Faith, honor,
all that crap.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.053
How does that crap go?

22:34.086 --> 22:35.888
You know, that used to
keep me going,

22:35.922 --> 22:38.525
thinking I was
some kind of hero.

22:40.092 --> 22:43.062
But these covert ops...

22:43.095 --> 22:44.797
Damn, half the time,

22:44.831 --> 22:45.898
we don't even know
what we're doing.

22:45.932 --> 22:49.035
Just fly, don't
ask questions.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.538
(scoffs)

22:51.571 --> 22:52.805
Look where it got us.

22:52.839 --> 22:55.942
I don't know what
I have faith in anymore.

22:55.975 --> 22:58.010
I have faith in you.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.552
That's sweet.

23:07.086 --> 23:10.056
Hey.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.558
You stay with me.

23:11.591 --> 23:14.961
Okay?

23:14.994 --> 23:17.764
(weakly):
Okay.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.903
(helicopter rumbling)

23:23.936 --> 23:25.071
That's a Black Hawk.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.205
Coming this way!

23:26.238 --> 23:27.740
Oh, thank God.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.542
They... they are
gonna separate us

23:29.576 --> 23:30.877
as soon as we're rescued.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.111
You remember the story
we agreed on?

23:32.144 --> 23:33.813
Yeah.
You stick to that.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.782
Until we can prove
it's an illegal mission.

23:35.815 --> 23:40.052
After seeing this place,
no... no, no, no, no.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.622
The plan's got to change.

23:42.655 --> 23:43.656
The CIA worked hard
to cover this up.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.925
They're... they're gonna

23:45.958 --> 23:47.126
cover up the proof, too.

23:47.159 --> 23:48.828
We get caught
looking for answers,

23:48.861 --> 23:50.497
it's only gonna
make things worse.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.831
I killed a man, Gallo.

23:51.864 --> 23:53.065
I need those answers.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.568
We are not heroes, Madani,
we're soldiers.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.103
The best thing
we can do right now--

23:57.136 --> 23:59.639
we keep our mouth shut,
we forget.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.237
* How many places
have I seen... *

24:31.270 --> 24:33.906
Shadow Raiders...

24:33.940 --> 24:37.644
here's to one of our
grandest traditions,

24:37.677 --> 24:40.246
the pre-deployment throwdown!

24:40.279 --> 24:42.949
ALL:
Hooah!

24:42.982 --> 24:44.651
(wolf whistle)

24:44.684 --> 24:45.985
MAN:
Whoa.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.787
* Nothing can stop me...

24:47.820 --> 24:50.723
Well, hooah, everyone.

24:50.757 --> 24:53.893
* Watch me walk...

24:53.926 --> 24:54.761
Yeah, I came to support.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.295
I am running the mission,
after all.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.198
Well, you certainly have
been noticed,

24:59.231 --> 25:01.568
by Delta Force,
in particular.

25:01.601 --> 25:02.702
Oh, lucky me.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.737
I actually have
some good news.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.573
Khalid's brother is
in poor health.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.875
They logged him with heart
problems when he got captured.

25:08.908 --> 25:11.911
Seems captivity's
only made it worse.
How is that good news?

25:11.944 --> 25:13.880
It means he's not a threat--
it makes him a lot easier
to give up.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.848
We'll open negotiations
with Khalid,

25:15.882 --> 25:18.885
see if he'll take the deal--
his brother for our guys.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.953
If he will, we run it by D.C.,
get the exchange approved.

25:20.987 --> 25:23.590
I'm glad to hear that.

25:23.623 --> 25:26.993
You know, I really enjoy
working with you, Lieutenant.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.060
Have you ever thought
about coming over

25:28.094 --> 25:30.129
to the civilian side
of things?

25:30.162 --> 25:31.798
No.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.666
You should think about it.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.001
Better opportunity
for advancement,

25:35.034 --> 25:36.836
especially for
a congresswoman's son.

25:43.943 --> 25:45.678
I went to see
Goundry's sister,

25:45.712 --> 25:48.080
and I was followed.
It sure looked like CIA.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.682
Don't worry, I lost 'em.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.684
I told you to be careful.

25:53.019 --> 25:55.321
Well, the sister tell you
anything useful?

25:55.354 --> 25:57.223
Nope.

25:57.256 --> 25:58.858
I think you better
ease off, then.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.227
What? No.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.796
You wanted me to
back off in Somalia.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.331
Then the CIA took over
the rescue mission,

26:05.364 --> 26:06.132
and you changed your mind.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.767
Don't change it back
on me again.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.069
(phone vibrating)

26:11.704 --> 26:14.206
You ignoring your mom?
Yeah.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.908
She's trying to set up
the FaceTime dinner.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.177
Just can't handle that
right now.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.879
You want to talk about it?

26:19.912 --> 26:21.047
We've been over that.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.216
Let me ask you something.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.918
Half the guys in there
want to buy CIA chick a drink,

26:25.952 --> 26:28.020
so why's she wasting time
talking to that girl?

26:28.054 --> 26:29.689
That woman

26:29.722 --> 26:31.223
is Sergeant Zoe Cho.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.159
One of the only other
female Shadow Raiders.

26:33.192 --> 26:36.062
You two on the, uh,
same cycle yet?
No.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.229
But by the end of this mission,

26:37.263 --> 26:38.765
you and I probably will be.

26:38.798 --> 26:41.634
(laughing)

26:44.203 --> 26:46.105
HASKINS:
For those who are about
to deploy,

26:46.138 --> 26:48.040
we toast you.

26:48.074 --> 26:50.042
Look to your left,

26:50.076 --> 26:53.045
and look to your right.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.280
Your brothers and sisters
might not be here

26:54.313 --> 26:55.815
when next we meet.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.817
Be strong.

26:57.850 --> 27:01.087
Go with God
and come home to us.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.221
Hooah!

27:02.254 --> 27:04.724
ALL:
Hooah!

27:08.160 --> 27:10.730
So, uh, you want to get
a drink somewhere else?

27:10.763 --> 27:13.032
Might be your last chance.
I could die out there.

27:13.065 --> 27:16.435
Ooh, yeah, no, I like
to live on the edge, Sergeant.

27:16.468 --> 27:19.939
(both speaking indistinctly)

27:21.407 --> 27:23.375
Come on,
let's go home.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.712
Let's go home.

27:25.745 --> 27:27.914
It's gonna be okay.

27:27.947 --> 27:30.016
Just like every other time.
I'm gonna come back.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.203
(soldiers chanting)

27:52.238 --> 27:55.041
Are you thirsty?
(sighs)

27:55.074 --> 27:58.110
I'm not ready to move.
(groans)

28:02.014 --> 28:03.916
I hope this doesn't
affect you at work.

28:03.950 --> 28:07.820
I, uh... I assume some people
saw us leave together.

28:07.854 --> 28:11.090
I don't give a crap
about them.

28:11.123 --> 28:13.025
Which is what it takes
to be one of the guys.

28:13.059 --> 28:14.493
That can't be easy.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.996
Do you help each other through
it, you and Ms. Madani?

28:17.029 --> 28:18.164
We don't share shampoo
and secrets,

28:18.197 --> 28:19.331
if that's what you mean.

28:19.365 --> 28:23.302
Hmm.
Is information what this
little experiment was about?

28:23.335 --> 28:26.038
No.

28:26.072 --> 28:27.439
And I'm way past experimenting.

28:27.473 --> 28:29.041
I know exactly what I'm doing.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.014
(laughter)

28:35.047 --> 28:37.249
ANNA:
Oh, my God!

28:37.283 --> 28:38.951
GALLO:
Look at this.

28:38.985 --> 28:40.519
Door-to-door service.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.089
Don't you ever say
I didn't treat you right.

28:43.122 --> 28:46.092
(laughter)

28:47.293 --> 28:49.862
* This I know...

28:49.896 --> 28:51.263
Oh, yeah.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.465
What's in the box?
No, wait.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.067
Let me guess.
(gasps)

28:55.101 --> 28:56.135
You got us new handcuffs.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.037
(chuckles):
Yeah, you wish.

28:58.070 --> 29:01.140
No, no. Something
from my mama.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.109
Aw. I love me a mama's boy.

29:03.142 --> 29:05.344
Yeah?
(laughs)

29:05.377 --> 29:07.079
I mean, I could stay.

29:07.113 --> 29:09.515
I could make you breakfast.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.217
(giggles)

29:11.250 --> 29:13.552
Sorry, I, uh, got plans.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.387
What kind of plans?

29:18.825 --> 29:20.960
More secrets?

29:24.263 --> 29:27.466
Just keep me out of it
this time, all right?

29:27.499 --> 29:29.401
It's got nothing
to do with that, all right?

29:29.435 --> 29:32.238
Just another day on the job.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.239
* I don't want to run around

29:33.272 --> 29:37.409
* I don't want to run around,
no, I don't *

29:37.443 --> 29:39.946
* Don't, don't

29:39.979 --> 29:41.213
* This I know.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.161
AIRMAN (over radio):
Landing in six mikes.

30:24.123 --> 30:27.626
* I get high

30:27.659 --> 30:31.097
* I get low

30:31.130 --> 30:35.201
* I get high

30:35.234 --> 30:37.003
GALLO: Seat belts.
Shoulder harness.

30:37.036 --> 30:37.603
MADANI:
Check.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.305
GALLO:
Avionics.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.007
MADANI:
On and set.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.042
Fuel.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.410
3/4, as requested.

30:44.443 --> 30:46.278
We ready to rock?
COOGAN: You know what I think,
Captain Gallo?

30:46.312 --> 30:48.881
A full tank would have
been a lot safer.

30:48.915 --> 30:51.517
Not your call, Sergeant Coogan.

30:51.550 --> 30:52.518
Clear on one.

30:52.551 --> 30:55.487
*

30:55.521 --> 30:57.389
*

30:59.225 --> 31:01.227
*

31:01.260 --> 31:02.561
*

31:02.594 --> 31:04.863
* Just to die for

31:06.498 --> 31:07.666
* Just to die for.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.369
They're approaching
the refugee camp.

31:12.671 --> 31:14.173
I'm seeing movement
on the ground.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.208
Can you zoom in?

31:16.242 --> 31:17.977
Two vehicles. Looks like trucks.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.545
Can you get that
any clearer?

31:21.547 --> 31:23.215
HASKINS:
What do you think?
I think it's trouble.

31:23.249 --> 31:24.483
There's not a lot
of people in this area

31:24.516 --> 31:25.484
that can afford a truck--

31:25.517 --> 31:27.053
most who can are criminals.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.054
There's a tarp on the back
of that one.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.121
From the shape of it,
I'd say that's covering

31:29.155 --> 31:31.490
a mounted machine gun.

31:31.523 --> 31:33.926
Didn't get where I am
by being an idiot, Colonel.

31:33.960 --> 31:34.860
Renegade One-Two.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.563
Renegade One-Two,
we've got two vehicles

31:37.596 --> 31:39.966
on the Reaper feed. Looks like
one could be a technical.

31:39.999 --> 31:42.034
Three klicks
to your south.

31:42.068 --> 31:43.135
Looks like they may be headed
toward the camp.

31:43.169 --> 31:45.037
90 seconds till they're
under the flight path, sir.

31:51.343 --> 31:53.012
What if it's a hostile, sir?

31:53.045 --> 31:55.181
We got an alt route,
other side of the mountain.

31:55.214 --> 31:56.248
Let's take it.

31:56.282 --> 31:57.349
We're past the pivot point.

31:57.383 --> 31:58.584
We'd have to backtrack.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.352
Ah, we can't.

32:00.386 --> 32:02.254
We do that, we might not have
fuel to get back to base.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.556
You got us
in this situation, sir.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.559
You'd better get us out of it.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.461
Need to find another alt.

32:09.495 --> 32:11.497
Madani, you on that?

32:11.530 --> 32:13.265
Madani.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.601
(distantly):
Madani.

32:15.634 --> 32:16.635
(Madani screams)

32:18.004 --> 32:21.040
Hey, you got this, okay?

32:21.073 --> 32:22.241
I have faith in you.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.110
Remember when
you told me that?

32:26.478 --> 32:29.348
Goes both ways. You got this.

32:29.381 --> 32:32.151
Hooah. Sir, yes, I do.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.355
There's a mountain pass
one klick north.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.457
Weather conditions look good.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.059
I think we can make it.

32:40.092 --> 32:40.759
You think?

32:40.792 --> 32:43.195
I say we find out.

32:43.229 --> 32:45.197
Rock and roll.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.181
Where we at?

33:02.214 --> 33:04.450
Nearly out of the pass
and on track for time.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.018
Watch out. Two o'clock.

33:11.657 --> 33:15.227
MADANI:
There's the camp.

33:15.261 --> 33:17.229
And one narrow-ass landing zone.

33:20.666 --> 33:21.633
You have the controls.

33:22.768 --> 33:24.536
I have the controls.

33:24.570 --> 33:27.506
I don't know how
they're going to land there.

33:46.192 --> 33:47.826
HASKINS:
Well done.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.561
Now let's get
that medicine unloaded.

33:49.595 --> 33:50.429
Let's go! Move!

33:53.465 --> 33:56.235
COOGAN: All clear.
Let's move it.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.192
They beat the trucks there,
but not by much.

34:20.226 --> 34:21.327
HASKINS:
Renegade, heads up.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.829
Vehicles approaching.

34:23.862 --> 34:25.497
Technical! Seven o'clock!

34:25.531 --> 34:27.266
Renegade,
those are hostiles.

34:27.299 --> 34:28.200
If they fire,

34:28.234 --> 34:30.202
you are authorized to engage.

34:33.539 --> 34:35.874
(gunshots)
(people screaming)

34:35.907 --> 34:38.144
GALLO: We got tangos,
seven o'clock!

34:49.488 --> 34:51.423
How many tangos down?

34:52.924 --> 34:54.793
Five! Three to go!

34:56.195 --> 34:57.596
They're hiding! I can't see 'em!

34:57.629 --> 34:59.565
All right. Four
more bags to go.

34:59.598 --> 35:00.766
Let's give them
cover fire!

35:00.799 --> 35:02.468
Roger that. I got your six.

35:02.501 --> 35:03.535
You sure about that, sir?

35:03.569 --> 35:05.837
It didn't seem that way before.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.306
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.141
Should've trusted you.

35:09.175 --> 35:10.809
You got no idea how much
I hate admitting that.

35:13.379 --> 35:14.880
You think we got 'em all, sir?

35:14.913 --> 35:16.315
I don't know.

35:16.348 --> 35:17.649
Delta guys are coming back!

35:19.351 --> 35:20.686
Let's do it!

35:20.719 --> 35:22.120
Up with five.
(gunfire)

35:24.223 --> 35:25.257
Eight o'clock.

35:26.358 --> 35:27.526
I don't have a shot!

35:27.559 --> 35:29.561
Ah, better
on your side, Madani.

35:29.595 --> 35:31.597
I have the controls.

36:04.396 --> 36:07.199
That was your second kill.

36:07.233 --> 36:08.700
You okay?

36:14.340 --> 36:15.674
(groans)

36:18.377 --> 36:20.512
You did good, Nora.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.581
I almost didn't, though.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.850
Froze up when
we needed to reroute.

36:24.883 --> 36:26.585
You worked through it.

36:26.618 --> 36:29.321
I should've worked through it
before the mission.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.692
Was gonna go
to Mental Health.

36:34.993 --> 36:37.829
But what was I gonna tell them?

36:37.863 --> 36:39.531
The only person
who understands,

36:39.565 --> 36:41.267
the only person
I can actually talk to

36:41.300 --> 36:42.401
is you.

36:44.803 --> 36:46.838
And I wasn't listening.

36:46.872 --> 36:50.476
I didn't want to admit
that I was spooked.

36:50.509 --> 36:53.979
That's why I wouldn't
listen to Coogan, either.

36:54.012 --> 36:56.948
Is that an apology I hear?

36:56.982 --> 36:58.884
Take it how you will.

36:59.918 --> 37:02.788
Did it feel different?

37:02.821 --> 37:05.991
Like we were doing
something good.

37:06.024 --> 37:08.394
Getting one step
closer to Jimmy.

37:08.427 --> 37:10.562
Did it feel heroic?

37:10.596 --> 37:12.598
(chuckles lightly)

37:14.733 --> 37:16.868
Yeah.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.470
I guess so.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.878
CRANK: This whole thing
smelled bad from the start.

37:26.912 --> 37:28.580
What do you mean?

37:28.614 --> 37:32.451
Night of the mission, the
prisoner wasn't what I expected.

37:32.484 --> 37:35.587
That CIA officer had us shoot
at the ceiling.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.458
Something seemed off.

37:39.491 --> 37:42.328
It's easier to think
it was all for something,

37:42.361 --> 37:45.464
something honorable.

37:45.497 --> 37:46.798
If it wasn't...

37:46.832 --> 37:49.435
Yeah, it's a tough pill
to swallow.

37:49.468 --> 37:51.002
You have anybody at home?

37:51.036 --> 37:52.938
All this time, you never said.

37:52.971 --> 37:55.341
I had a wife.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.075
She took off about a year ago.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.611
I'm sorry.

37:59.645 --> 38:02.448
It ain't easy being married
to someone who does what I do,

38:02.481 --> 38:04.350
what we do.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.985
No.

38:07.018 --> 38:09.321
It isn't.

38:09.355 --> 38:12.691
We're not gonna die here, man.

38:12.724 --> 38:15.627
Yeah, let's just hope that
God of yours is listening.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.732
Mom, look.

38:20.766 --> 38:24.102
It's the jet, the big one
that brings Dad home.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.537
Is it him?

38:25.571 --> 38:27.373
Not this time, honey.

38:29.375 --> 38:30.376
I miss him.

38:30.409 --> 38:32.711
I miss him, too.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.413
But he would want
us to be strong.

38:34.446 --> 38:35.947
Strong for what?

38:35.981 --> 38:37.549
The waiting.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.558
I thought we were
going to Hudson's

38:46.592 --> 38:49.027
for dinner with him and his dad.
We were.

38:49.060 --> 38:53.765
But you made me remember
something very important.

38:53.799 --> 38:57.636
We need a pizza
and movie night.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.070
Just us.

38:59.104 --> 39:00.472
Do you want to go
grab us some menus?

39:00.506 --> 39:01.473
Okay.

39:06.812 --> 39:09.481
(clears throat)

39:09.515 --> 39:11.417
You've reached Ryan.
Please leave a message.

39:11.450 --> 39:12.551
(voice mail beeps)

39:12.584 --> 39:15.120
Ryan, it's Jess.

39:15.153 --> 39:17.423
We were just about to leave,
but I, um,

39:17.456 --> 39:19.391
I shouldn't have let you think

39:19.425 --> 39:23.495
that this is something
that I could do.

39:23.529 --> 39:26.565
Even talking.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.133
I'm sorry.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.368
I need to do this on my own.

39:32.170 --> 39:35.974
* When you came at night

39:36.007 --> 39:39.144
* They were walking by

39:39.177 --> 39:43.148
* Know we tried

39:43.181 --> 39:46.585
* When the news spread 'round

39:46.618 --> 39:48.820
* We could hear the voices...

39:48.854 --> 39:50.889
I made it back.

39:50.922 --> 39:54.159
* As we walked in town

39:54.192 --> 39:56.695
* There were eyes above us

39:56.728 --> 39:58.029
* Know we tried...

39:58.063 --> 39:59.431
I have some news.

39:59.465 --> 40:02.434
Looks like the prisoner
exchange is in play.

40:02.468 --> 40:04.770
That's good news, right?
Yeah.

40:04.803 --> 40:09.508
Yeah, but it does mean that
you'll be going back... soon.

40:19.618 --> 40:20.786
(groans)

40:20.819 --> 40:22.821
(line dialing)

40:25.957 --> 40:27.092
Hey, Mama.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.627
Well, hello, stranger.

40:28.660 --> 40:29.861
Yeah, I just got home.

40:29.895 --> 40:31.530
Am I in time for dinner?

40:31.563 --> 40:33.198
You sure are.
We were just sitting down.

40:33.231 --> 40:34.533
(laughs)

40:34.566 --> 40:36.134
I hope you're hungry.

40:36.167 --> 40:39.104
(chuckles)

40:42.240 --> 40:44.543
(phone vibrating)

40:44.576 --> 40:47.078
Hello?

40:47.112 --> 40:48.514
DEIDRE:
Nora?

40:48.547 --> 40:50.215
It's Deidre Goundry,
from the diner.

40:50.248 --> 40:53.485
Did you really know my brother?

40:53.519 --> 40:55.220
I tried to.

40:55.253 --> 40:57.155
Because you aren't the first
to ask about him.

40:57.188 --> 41:01.259
Some people came to my house
last week,

41:01.292 --> 41:03.629
people in suits
who didn't give names.

41:03.662 --> 41:05.163
You can probably guess
what that means.

41:05.196 --> 41:06.665
What did they want?

41:06.698 --> 41:09.668
They asked about his loyalty
to his country,

41:09.701 --> 41:13.505
if he had sympathy
to radical causes. Crazy stuff.

41:13.539 --> 41:15.173
In front of my son.

41:15.206 --> 41:17.509
I'm so sorry, Deidre.

41:17.543 --> 41:18.577
The last time he deployed,

41:18.610 --> 41:19.878
Davis said some things,

41:19.911 --> 41:21.547
how he was
questioning everything

41:21.580 --> 41:24.015
he'd ever believed in.

41:24.049 --> 41:27.719
He was... haunted.

41:27.753 --> 41:30.055
The way you talked in the diner,
I can tell you are, too.

41:30.088 --> 41:32.057
If you know something,

41:32.090 --> 41:33.825
I want you to tell me.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.927
Was my brother a traitor?

41:35.961 --> 41:38.129
(knock on door)

41:42.868 --> 41:44.570
Davis Goundry's sister
just called me.

41:44.603 --> 41:46.705
What she said and the fact

41:46.738 --> 41:48.607
that he and Khalid were both
holding a domino,

41:48.640 --> 41:50.075
I think they may have been
working together.

41:50.108 --> 41:51.176
No.

41:51.209 --> 41:52.744
Gallo.
No way.

41:52.778 --> 41:54.746
What if we made a mistake
that night in Somalia?

41:57.048 --> 41:59.618
What if we let a terrorist
go free?
