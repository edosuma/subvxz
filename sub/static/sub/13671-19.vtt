01:27.120 --> 01:30.000
I'm looking for Dr Westphall.
He's expecting me.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.760
Down the hall, that way.
Second door on the left.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.760
            Thank you.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.000
KNOCKING

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
KNOCKING
Come in.

01:48.480 --> 01:52.480
George.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.800
Here I am.
Back in the house McCabe built.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.080
You look great.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.800
               Ryan.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.800
This is Dr Westphall. He and I were
best friends when we were growing up.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.600
       I'm worried, Donald.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.320
Ryan's been feeling lousy
the last couple of weeks.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.120
Coughing, peeing a lot, out of sorts.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.760
I know, I talked briefly
     with your doctor.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.480
Let's have a look at you, pal.
Feeling a little punk, are we?

02:14.480 --> 02:18.480
A little.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.200
Open your mouth, will you?

02:22.200 --> 02:25.480
Are you thirsty all the time?

02:25.480 --> 02:28.680
OK, well let's check you in
and do some tests, all right?

02:28.680 --> 02:32.680
Don't worry, George.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.600
Have a seat.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.280
Somebody will be down to get you.
Eventually.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.960
Why don't you just put
that speech on tape?

02:39.960 --> 02:42.160
What are you up to anyway?

02:42.160 --> 02:44.000
             59, 170.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.160
This the kind of material you
were doing before you got shot?

02:47.160 --> 02:49.720
Drug centre rehabbed
your sense of humour too.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.720
Off the dope,
back to the old Julie McPhail.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.160
I thought you were
getting patient histories.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.600
This looks like a
college transcript.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.400
This looks like a
college transcript.
               Shhh.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.520
Can you keep a secret?

03:00.520 --> 03:01.000
Can you keep a secret?
                No.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.320
Can you keep a secret?
                No.
I'll tell you anyway.

03:02.320 --> 03:06.160
I'm changing a grade. I got an
incomplete in Kilroy's English class.

03:06.160 --> 03:09.640
You've been out of school for ten
years. You've got a medical degree.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.840
What the hell's the difference?

03:11.840 --> 03:15.240
Ever since my near-demise,
I've been tying up some loose ends,

03:15.240 --> 03:16.840
     and the occasional nurse.

03:16.840 --> 03:20.840
This scarlet I has been gnawing
at my craw for the last few years.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.440
           Not any more.

03:24.440 --> 03:25.960
Excuse me.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.000
What can I do for you?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.200
What can I do for you?
I'm in labour.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.120
I'm in management.

03:31.120 --> 03:32.760
Could you tell Dr Morrison I'm here?

03:32.760 --> 03:36.760
Mrs Tillman. Melissa Tillman.

03:36.960 --> 03:40.880
Could you page Dr Morrison
to admitting?

03:40.880 --> 03:41.760
              Hello.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.600
              Hello.
Hi.

03:44.600 --> 03:48.440
Ooh, I think I'd better sit down.

03:48.440 --> 03:51.400
Get her upstairs stat and be
sure she's well taken care of.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.440
Why? What's it to you?

03:53.440 --> 03:57.440
   That woman's having my baby.

04:03.440 --> 04:07.440
OK, hop out.

04:08.440 --> 04:11.200
These are yours. Put them on.
Do you want some help?

04:11.200 --> 04:12.240
No.

04:12.240 --> 04:15.480
OK, I'll be back in a
while to take some blood.

04:15.480 --> 04:19.480
From your neck.

04:25.480 --> 04:29.360
A little old, but I'd do that.
I'd do that in a second.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.080
         Bring any comics?

04:31.080 --> 04:32.280
No.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.040
Useless.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.920
Any hot-looking sisters
gonna be visiting?

04:35.920 --> 04:38.240
All mine are ugly.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.360
   Shame. What's wrong with you?

04:40.360 --> 04:41.720
   Shame. What's wrong with you?
Don't know.

04:41.720 --> 04:45.120
Ditto.
Something in my arm.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.920
They're slicing Marcus open tomorrow.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.560
Heart surgery.
Imagine that.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.120
Some doc touching your bare heart.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.120
What's wrong with you?

04:52.120 --> 04:53.920
               Shhh!

04:53.920 --> 04:56.560
         He's a murderer.

04:56.560 --> 04:59.920
Great.
These pyjamas have holes in them.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.160
          Call the nurse.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.160
How?

05:03.160 --> 05:07.160
   Push that button over there.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.040
I was wondering if...

05:19.040 --> 05:23.040
Let's go.
Careful here. Coming through.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.720
Where's the code?

05:30.720 --> 05:33.640
All right, who's the wise guy?

05:33.640 --> 05:37.640
               Him.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.160
 Ehrlich is supposed to assist me

05:43.160 --> 05:45.640
on a valve replacement in
20 minutes. Have you seen him?

05:45.640 --> 05:48.360
He called earlier today,
this morning, and said he

05:48.360 --> 05:50.240
had to go out of town unexpectedly.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.840
# With a nick nack paddy whack,
 give a dog a bone

05:53.840 --> 05:55.800
# This old man came rolling home.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.960
Daniel, I have been thinking
about the hospital being sold.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.560
Don't know why, but these
old nursery rhymes have

06:01.560 --> 06:03.400
been running through
my head all morning.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.320
Now that Boston General has passed...

06:05.320 --> 06:08.320
Nick nack paddy whack?
What is the poem intended to mean?

06:08.320 --> 06:12.120
Instead of waiting for the city
to palm us off on God knows who,

06:12.120 --> 06:15.160
we should be actively looking
for a buyer we can live with.

06:15.160 --> 06:18.560
I agree.
Some group with a large cash flow,

06:18.560 --> 06:21.080
rooted in humanitarian goals.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.080
An organisation that has withstood

06:23.080 --> 06:26.520
crusades, reformations,
inquisitions.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.960
Yes, well, while you're
talking to the Elks Club,

06:28.960 --> 06:30.520
  I want to pursue my own angle.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.080
Hickory dickory dock,
   the mouse ran up the clock,

06:33.080 --> 06:35.120
the clock struck one,
     the mouse ran down. Why?

06:35.120 --> 06:39.120
Maybe he got tired of talking to you.

06:39.400 --> 06:43.400
# With a nick nack paddy whack,
 give the dog a bone. #

06:44.160 --> 06:45.960
      The square root of 64,

06:45.960 --> 06:49.960
minus the square
of two plus six,

06:51.520 --> 06:53.720
          divided by two,

06:53.720 --> 06:57.720
and the angle of the dangle is five.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.960
         I hate homework.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.600
They took a lot of blood.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.280
Yeah, the local vampires
here take it from everyone.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.520
         What's your name?

07:07.520 --> 07:08.600
Ryan.

07:08.600 --> 07:12.400
Elvis.
My mom freaked over Elvis Presley.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.280
I don't mind being named after him,

07:14.280 --> 07:18.280
because I hear before he was a fat
greaser, he got lots of women.

07:26.640 --> 07:27.640
Elvis?

07:27.640 --> 07:30.920
I'm Doctor Novino.

07:30.920 --> 07:32.680
Here to take you down
for your bone scan.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.400
               Wow.

07:34.400 --> 07:38.400
Into the wheelchair.

07:42.080 --> 07:46.080
    You've got ravishing eyes.

07:49.400 --> 07:53.400
     Great start, you...dork.

07:55.600 --> 07:59.600
Hey, what's your name?

08:03.120 --> 08:07.000
I'm so out of touch, you know. I
have no idea what you've been doing.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.080
After the Navy, I started
a construction outfit.

08:10.080 --> 08:13.480
I lost that business and
a couple of others along the way.

08:13.480 --> 08:16.120
Now I'm a ground foreman for
a big contractor in the city.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.000
So how is it you
managed to keep your hair?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.240
          Lucky, I guess.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.400
Been married long?

08:21.400 --> 08:23.120
         Second time. You?

08:23.120 --> 08:25.520
My wife died.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.680
Haven't been able
to find anyone else.

08:28.680 --> 08:31.600
Plenty of those around.
Just got to look. Kids?

08:31.600 --> 08:33.400
Yeah, two. Daughter and son.

08:33.400 --> 08:34.600
        How old's your boy?

08:34.600 --> 08:37.000
Tommy's 10. No, he's 11.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.679
 About the same age you and I were

08:38.679 --> 08:42.679
when we stole old man
Milton's pocket watch.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.920
I can him see now laying
up in that barber chair

08:45.920 --> 08:49.160
with a towel over his fat face.
Perfect set-up, wasn't it?

08:49.160 --> 08:53.160
You distracted Sean
and I lifted that pocket watch

08:53.200 --> 08:56.440
right out of his vest pocket.
Got away clean.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.080
God, it was beautiful.

08:58.080 --> 09:01.240
All solid gold and engraved,
with that long gold fob.

09:01.240 --> 09:04.120
You and I sat there for hours,
staring at the damn thing.

09:04.120 --> 09:06.560
Thought we'd get
caught if we pawned it.

09:06.560 --> 09:09.480
Then we buried it in an old
coffee can out in the park.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.280
Our time capsule.

09:11.280 --> 09:12.920
            Our secret.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.600
Dr Westphall, I have
these lab reports for you.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.440
Can't it wait, Elliot?

09:16.440 --> 09:20.440
Can't it wait, Elliot?
I thought you might
want to see this.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.880
OK, thank you, Elliot.

09:25.880 --> 09:26.880
Yes, sir.

09:26.880 --> 09:30.080
      Big man at St Eligius.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.360
        Is something wrong?

09:31.360 --> 09:34.120
Ryan's lab reports.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.960
It's what I suspected when
you brought him in, George.

09:36.960 --> 09:40.960
I don't want you to panic.

09:41.160 --> 09:45.160
Your boy has diabetes.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.960
     Still don't remember me?

09:47.960 --> 09:49.720
     Still don't remember me?
I'm sorry.

09:49.720 --> 09:53.240
I visited you on the day you
were artificially inseminated.

09:53.240 --> 09:57.240
    I left you a savings bond.

09:58.360 --> 10:01.480
Oh, yeah. My husband and I
   could never figure out why.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.440
It's hospital policy -
every hundredth patient

10:04.440 --> 10:06.680
     gets a share of America.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.120
    What'd the ultrasound show?

10:09.120 --> 10:11.800
Melissa, you and the baby
are going to be fine. But...

10:11.800 --> 10:13.400
               But?

10:13.400 --> 10:16.920
You went into false labour. I'd like
to keep you for another day or two.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.960
    How dilated is the cervix?

10:18.960 --> 10:22.560
Sometimes false labour
can trigger the real thing.

10:22.560 --> 10:23.240
Oh, no.

10:23.240 --> 10:24.840
   It's nothing to worry about.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.040
Can I see you in the hallway?

10:26.040 --> 10:27.520
               Sure.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.560
        I'll be right back.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.760
Somehow I knew you'd say that.

10:32.760 --> 10:35.040
I looked on the chart,
      and her records,

10:35.040 --> 10:39.040
and I didn't see your name
associated with this case anywhere.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.440
My involvement with the
Tillmans is confidential.

10:44.440 --> 10:45.920
Come on, Fiscus, the truth.

10:45.920 --> 10:49.920
                OK.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.200
Wayne-o!

10:53.200 --> 10:54.520
         Beat it, Elliot.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.520
Hey, I just laid down.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.400
             Get out.

10:59.400 --> 11:03.400
OK!

11:09.360 --> 11:13.240
Nine months ago,
I was engaged to be married.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.920
       That's not important.

11:14.920 --> 11:18.280
  Caldwell had just gotten AIDS.

11:18.280 --> 11:22.080
     But that's not important.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.280
I had my semen
freeze-dried for posterity,

11:24.280 --> 11:26.640
    left it in the sperm bank.

11:26.640 --> 11:27.800
Oh, yeah, I remember.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.440
  By mistake it got inseminated.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.520
In Mrs Tillman.

11:31.520 --> 11:35.520
               Yep.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.560
Ever since I died,
I've had this amorphous memory

11:40.560 --> 11:44.560
of talking to the mirror
about things I hadn't done yet -

11:45.320 --> 11:47.040
          having a child.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.440
You've got a family.
You take it for granted.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.320
I'm not even close
to being married now.

11:52.320 --> 11:56.320
The next time I die,
I'm afraid it's gonna be forever.

11:56.520 --> 12:00.160
So this child may be my only legacy.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.160
Powerful stuff.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.960
     You understand my crisis?

12:03.960 --> 12:07.120
No, I'm talking about your protein.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.280
Mrs Tillman.

12:09.280 --> 12:13.280
She's gonna have twins.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.360
That hurt?

12:16.360 --> 12:18.040
             A little.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.520
Police dog got you pretty good.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.160
             Doberman.

12:21.160 --> 12:23.320
OK, we just have to
wrap this all over again.

12:23.320 --> 12:26.960
The ER report from last
night said you got injured

12:26.960 --> 12:29.280
trying to rob a liquor store.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.720
The other guy they brought in
with you got shot in the throat.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.000
  You know what happened to him?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.200
No, only that he was
taken in for surgery.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.640
Guess you'll get a couple of months

12:38.640 --> 12:42.200
in a juvenile detention centre
  for this.

12:42.200 --> 12:46.200
You know, when I was 14,
I was running for student council,

12:46.320 --> 12:50.320
trying out for the
cross-country team.

12:50.400 --> 12:54.400
Never mind.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.720
You robbed a liquor store?!

12:56.720 --> 12:58.960
               Yeah.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.480
What are they going to do to you?

13:00.480 --> 13:03.200
             Nothing.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.200
I'd be scared.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.720
             Figures.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.000
Can I ask you another question?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.920
                No.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.400
Get in bed, son.

13:12.400 --> 13:16.400
Ryan, we have to talk.

13:23.280 --> 13:27.280
          Hang in there.

13:31.160 --> 13:35.160
Carol - nice name!

13:45.680 --> 13:49.680
The bone scan will help us
locate the source of your infection.

13:49.680 --> 13:52.240
What do you listen to on that thing?

13:52.240 --> 13:53.280
The classics.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.600
        Beethoven, Mozart?

13:54.600 --> 13:57.680
The Beastie Boys!

13:57.680 --> 14:00.000
Listen, you just lie there
and don't move.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.680
Once the radioactive dye
has been absorbed by your bones,

14:03.680 --> 14:05.800
somebody will take you
down for a scan.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.640
And then I'll meet you in a few
hours, once you're finished, OK?

14:08.640 --> 14:12.120
Do you have that deal where if
a kid finds that he's really sick,

14:12.120 --> 14:13.640
he can get what he wants most?

14:13.640 --> 14:16.480
Yes, we have a Grant A Dream
programme.

14:16.480 --> 14:20.480
Good.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.520
        Under the B, nine.

14:24.520 --> 14:25.680
I don't have time for all this.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.200
I don't have time for all this.
   Nonsense, you paid your buck.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.880
Monsignor, you're director
    of medical operations

14:30.880 --> 14:32.440
for the archdiocese.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.200
You've got to be able to help us.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.560
         Under the N, 33.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.320
The church built the hospital.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.600
I can't fathom you'd let it
fall into the wrong hands.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.760
We sold it to the city.
What could be worse than that?

14:43.760 --> 14:47.760
     Made a pretty penny, too.

14:47.960 --> 14:51.440
I'm trying to patch together
a quilt, a consortium of all

14:51.440 --> 14:54.880
the religious leaders of the area,
to get them to put pressure on their

14:54.880 --> 14:57.960
denominations to come
through with large...

14:57.960 --> 14:59.240
denominations.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.640
         Under the O, 69.

15:01.640 --> 15:03.240
Can I count on you, Monsignor?

15:03.240 --> 15:06.200
You don't have a prayer.
I've been raising money for

15:06.200 --> 15:07.880
the Catholic Church for 40 years now.

15:07.880 --> 15:11.880
Come back here every week where I
began, raising nickels and dimes.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.000
     Frankly, Dr Auschlander,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.800
the charitable climate has become
so complex,

15:17.800 --> 15:19.600
   what with the new tax reforms

15:19.600 --> 15:23.080
and the severe drop
in churches' enrolment...

15:23.080 --> 15:26.600
I'm sorry, I just can't help you out.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.880
Our hospital was named
after one of your saints.

15:29.880 --> 15:33.880
How will he feel looking down from
heaven when the place is converted

15:33.880 --> 15:35.840
into condos for yuppies?

15:35.840 --> 15:39.840
I remember attending the
original dedication ceremony.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.680
You think there's life
in the old gal yet, huh?

15:43.680 --> 15:46.160
Absolutely.
  But what's more important is,

15:46.160 --> 15:50.160
we can't take the risk
  of finding out if I am wrong.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.560
               I 19.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.520
    I'll talk to the Cardinal.

15:57.520 --> 15:58.800
    I'll talk to the Cardinal.
Bingo.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.040
        Well, it's a start.

16:00.040 --> 16:04.040
No, I win. Bingo!

16:05.440 --> 16:09.440
This is what a syringe looks like.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.840
How long will I have
to take the shots?

16:11.840 --> 16:13.360
        Rest of your life.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.400
Do you get used to it?

16:15.400 --> 16:18.000
       Yeah. After a while.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
What I want you to do now
is practise, all right?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.600
 Now, pretend this is your thigh.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.200
  You put the needle in quickly.

16:26.200 --> 16:29.080
Like that.
Pull the plunger.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.520
Make sure there's no blood in there.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.960
Then you push the plunger all the
way down and pull the needle out.

16:34.960 --> 16:35.960
            That's it.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.280
What if I don't have the shots?

16:38.280 --> 16:40.840
Ryan, diabetes
is a very dangerous disease

16:40.840 --> 16:44.840
unless you take
these treatments.

16:48.360 --> 16:49.360
I won't be able to.

16:49.360 --> 16:52.720
 Plenty of time. There's no rush.

16:52.720 --> 16:56.640
Come on, give it a try, Tiger.

16:56.640 --> 17:00.640
I'll see you later.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.600
Damn it!

17:03.600 --> 17:07.240
George, he's gonna be fine. Stabilise
his blood sugar and teach him

17:07.240 --> 17:11.240
how to give himself those insulin
injections and you can take him home.

17:11.680 --> 17:14.079
My baby boy.

17:14.079 --> 17:17.920
Look, why don't we go out and have a
beer later? Something to eat? On me!

17:17.920 --> 17:19.480
It's a good idea.

17:19.480 --> 17:23.480
I'll call the wife.

17:23.599 --> 17:24.839
    I know how to drive a car.

17:24.839 --> 17:28.840
Uh-huh? OK, out you go.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.880
          See you, Carol.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.880
See ya.

17:35.080 --> 17:39.080
OK, lights out, the show's over.

17:40.120 --> 17:44.120
You, get some sleep.
It'll all be over tomorrow.

17:46.360 --> 17:50.360
OK, good night.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.960
And I mean it!

17:53.960 --> 17:57.960
     I think Carol's into me.

17:59.240 --> 18:01.280
    What you doing, Rye Bread?

18:01.280 --> 18:02.760
Prayers.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.560
           Kidding?!  No.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.000
       Who do you pray for?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.760
My parents and my brothers
and sisters and my dog.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.840
Who comes first?

18:10.840 --> 18:12.360
What d'you mean?

18:12.360 --> 18:14.920
When you say, "God bless so-and-so,"
who comes first?

18:14.920 --> 18:17.440
I dunno. Mom, I guess.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.880
That mean you love her the most?

18:18.880 --> 18:20.040
No.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.320
Why does she come first?

18:21.320 --> 18:22.920
Just does.

18:22.920 --> 18:25.680
 My mom would have to come first.

18:25.680 --> 18:28.520
She and I are the only
people in our family.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.760
If I prayed, it'd be for myself.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.200
What about your family?

18:32.200 --> 18:33.720
Never knew 'em.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.400
Foster kid.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.840
I could pray for Carol
to come in here tonight,

18:38.840 --> 18:42.240
       pull off her clothes.

18:42.240 --> 18:43.920
Mm, couldn't you imagine her naked?

18:43.920 --> 18:45.120
That's not what prayers are for.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.560
That's not what prayers are for.
             Who says?

18:46.560 --> 18:48.560
They're for other people.

18:48.560 --> 18:52.560
I'll say one for you.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.480
Henry's gotta be
around here someplace.

18:56.480 --> 19:00.480
I'm gonna find him.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.560
  When they wheeled me into X-ray

19:04.560 --> 19:08.560
I saw this room with an enormous
machine - like Star Trek. So cool!

19:08.840 --> 19:12.520
   I'm gonna go see what it was.

19:12.520 --> 19:16.520
God bless everyone.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.160
This is dumb.
It's cold and I'm hungry.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.640
Four, five...

19:25.640 --> 19:26.600
       Let's go have dinner.

19:26.600 --> 19:30.600
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.120
Ten paces from the oak tree.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.680
  No, George, it was five paces.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.760
Fine.
You dig there and I'll dig here.

19:37.760 --> 19:41.760
We planned to dig up this time
capsule again when we were old.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.160
I guess we qualify.

19:45.160 --> 19:49.040
Ryan - poor kid.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.320
Think he'll make it to our age?

19:50.320 --> 19:54.320
Sure he will. Diabetes is a serious
disease but it's controllable.

19:55.200 --> 19:58.640
Doesn't have to destroy
the quality of Ryan's life.

19:58.640 --> 20:02.040
What if the cops come?
We're defacing public property.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.320
You certainly haven't changed.
Start digging.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.880
     You always were fearless.

20:06.880 --> 20:10.880
I remember you jumping between
the subway tracks, catching rats.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.120
       And those postcards.

20:13.120 --> 20:16.120
Fresh from Paris, France!

20:16.120 --> 20:17.800
Always took care of
my Donny boy, didn't I?

20:17.800 --> 20:19.800
I was always afraid of going to hell.

20:19.800 --> 20:23.480
Father McCabe had you
     believing in damnation.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.720
All I really want to do
right now is go to dinner.

20:25.720 --> 20:29.720
Shut up and start digging!

20:38.880 --> 20:40.640
               Rats!

20:40.640 --> 20:43.120
Let the new owners exterminate them.

20:43.120 --> 20:47.120
No, I'm looking for an X-ray of
a hand. A kid, Michael Skelton.

20:47.800 --> 20:51.400
These, here?

20:51.400 --> 20:55.400
These first-year students never
put anything back where it belongs.

20:56.360 --> 20:57.560
          That's strange.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.440
What?

20:58.440 --> 21:00.040
It's supposed to be
an X-ray of a teen.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.280
It's supposed to be
an X-ray of a teen.
Yes?

21:01.280 --> 21:05.280
The growth plates are closed,
bones in wrist have calcified.

21:06.160 --> 21:10.160
I got a 14-year-old kid
with a 17-year-old hand.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.120
            Mr Tillman?

21:16.120 --> 21:16.920
Yes?

21:16.920 --> 21:19.440
I'm Dr Fiscus.
I'd like to do an examination.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.400
Is there a problem?

21:20.400 --> 21:23.320
He's the one who has
been bothering me.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.200
    I just have some questions.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.800
Has she been smoking, taking
drugs, drinking coffee?

21:28.800 --> 21:31.800
Listen, pal.
Dr Morrison knows those answers.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.200
We're not irresponsible people.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.240
    The heartbeats were strong.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.520
Do you have any idea how
difficult it's been for us

21:37.520 --> 21:39.120
to reach this point?

21:39.120 --> 21:40.840
The frustration, the humiliation?

21:40.840 --> 21:42.160
         They're kicking!

21:42.160 --> 21:44.520
We've used up our life savings
on this one roll of the dice.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.880
             Oh, man.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.280
You come hovering around here
uninvited. You're not our doctor.

21:49.280 --> 21:53.200
You're not our family.
OK, that's it.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.080
Stop it, Frank!

21:54.080 --> 21:56.720
Get away from my wife!

21:56.720 --> 22:00.720
         Not my new crown!

22:40.040 --> 22:44.040
           (BABY CRIES)

23:13.920 --> 23:15.800
     Do you think she saw us?

23:15.800 --> 23:19.040
If she did, she'd have screamed.

23:19.040 --> 23:23.040
Come on, let's go back to work.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.720
    I'm the head of a hospital,

23:24.720 --> 23:26.320
for Pete's sake,
how is this going to look?

23:26.320 --> 23:28.480
Bad.
Very bad.

23:28.480 --> 23:31.880
At least we weren't have
Father McCabe to haunt our souls.

23:31.880 --> 23:34.440
You know, he came to the
hospital a couple of months ago.

23:34.440 --> 23:37.000
I could never understand the
fascination he had for you,

23:37.000 --> 23:38.560
sitting in that confessional,

23:38.560 --> 23:41.040
claustrophobic, breathing in his
drunken breath and stinking clothes.

23:41.040 --> 23:44.760
Who could respect that?

23:44.760 --> 23:46.200
George, I can't believe
you're still teed off at me.

23:46.200 --> 23:47.800
George, I can't believe
you're still teed off at me.
What?

23:47.800 --> 23:49.080
    For confessing what we did.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.680
Wait a minute, I'm not teed off.

23:51.680 --> 23:54.440
Look, after we stole his watch
I had to tell someone, all right?

23:54.440 --> 23:56.960
I wanted Father McCabe
to absolve me of that sin.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.760
In return for that,
he made you a doctor?

23:58.760 --> 24:00.920
          That's stupid.

24:00.920 --> 24:04.920
You know, I think you're right.
I think it was five paces.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.600
From that point on, he looked at me
as if I was scum

24:07.600 --> 24:10.880
because I wouldn't go
    to his lousy confessional,

24:10.880 --> 24:13.680
get on my knees
      and beg his blessing.

24:13.680 --> 24:17.680
Hey! Peter!

24:27.240 --> 24:31.240
       Copy of the Globe...

24:32.080 --> 24:35.200
     Photo of the two of us...

24:35.200 --> 24:38.120
VE day.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.120
             A tooth?

24:39.120 --> 24:41.440
Oh, yes. My brother Larry's.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.560
I knocked it out in a
snowball fight. Remember?

24:44.560 --> 24:48.560
Frankie Frisch. I wonder
how much that's worth?

24:48.800 --> 24:50.440
            That's all.

24:50.440 --> 24:54.440
Wait, what do you mean,
     that's all?

24:54.920 --> 24:56.800
What happened to the pocket watch?

24:56.800 --> 24:57.600
          It's not there.

24:57.600 --> 25:01.600
I know it's not there.
Where the hell is it?

25:02.120 --> 25:05.560
George, I never had the
guts to tell you that, er,

25:05.560 --> 25:08.080
 after I confessed, Father McCabe

25:08.080 --> 25:10.920
and I came over and we dug up the
capsule and we gave the watch back.

25:10.920 --> 25:14.920
You always were a goody-two-shoes.

25:23.640 --> 25:26.280
              ..4, 5.

25:26.280 --> 25:30.280
          1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

25:39.920 --> 25:43.920
Mommy!

25:46.760 --> 25:49.280
I thought I'd find Henry someplace.

25:49.280 --> 25:52.680
He was shot when we knocked
over the liquor store.

25:52.680 --> 25:56.680
              Look...

26:22.480 --> 26:24.000
When you put two and two
together, Lucy and Erlich,

26:24.000 --> 26:25.760
I tell you, they eloped.

26:25.760 --> 26:28.320
That's a couple!
I mean, Lucy is

26:28.320 --> 26:32.160
hard enough to deal with but
having Erlich as a husband...

26:32.160 --> 26:34.280
Then again, the way things
are going, their marriage

26:34.280 --> 26:38.160
will last a million years.

26:38.160 --> 26:42.160
 Come on, just a little closer...

26:59.400 --> 27:03.400
           I missed her!

27:03.480 --> 27:06.080
I really didn't think
we'd meet this way.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.760
I thought you'd enjoy seeing

27:07.760 --> 27:10.240
our medical complex in Newport,
 New York.

27:10.240 --> 27:13.120
Just 45 minutes
      in the corporate jet.

27:13.120 --> 27:16.880
I wish I could come back
there but we need a co-pilot.

27:16.880 --> 27:17.960
       Don't worry about me.

27:17.960 --> 27:21.960
Feel free to move about the cabin.

27:22.520 --> 27:25.520
I understand you want us
     to buy a hospital?

27:25.520 --> 27:27.360
            St Eligius.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.400
Dump.

27:29.400 --> 27:33.400
Yes, well, my thinking was that
a health maintenance organisation

27:33.640 --> 27:36.560
like yours could operates
St Eligius very profitably.

27:36.560 --> 27:40.560
We're not looking
   for more outlets right now.

27:40.800 --> 27:44.120
I assure you that in purchasing
St Eligius, you'll be acquiring

27:44.120 --> 27:46.520
   top-notch medical personnel.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.640
         Including myself.

27:48.640 --> 27:52.320
And you'd be serving
a community sorely in need.

27:52.320 --> 27:54.360
Do you know what medicine is,
  Dr Craig?

27:54.360 --> 27:55.600
               Sure.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.200
            Big-ticket.

27:57.200 --> 27:59.760
Starts before you're born
and is there when you die

27:59.760 --> 28:01.840
       and that means money.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.440
    Millions of dollars a day.

28:04.440 --> 28:06.400
      Demand never dries up.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.360
      The key is efficiency.

28:08.360 --> 28:12.000
And the key to efficiency is
throwing out what isn't working.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.280
We'd have to make
some major changes.

28:15.280 --> 28:16.560
    We're a team at St Eligius.

28:16.560 --> 28:18.640
You'd be a wise choice
to head the hospital.

28:18.640 --> 28:22.200
When do you think you
could make your final decision?

28:22.200 --> 28:26.200
Take your seat. We're
heading for some turbulence.

28:30.880 --> 28:31.640
             Nice jet.

28:31.640 --> 28:33.760
Want to see what this baby can do?

28:33.760 --> 28:34.840
              Er, no.

28:34.840 --> 28:38.840
Hang on.

28:50.440 --> 28:52.600
                Hi.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.080
    We got your bone scan back.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.920
Shows a small infection
in the bone in your arm.

28:57.920 --> 29:01.600
Should be fine. We just need to do
what they call a biopsy.

29:01.600 --> 29:05.520
Make a small cut, take a
sample of the bone to find out

29:05.520 --> 29:09.200
what kind of drugs we need
to use to fight the infection.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.560
  I called your mom and told her.

29:11.560 --> 29:15.080
She's coming to see you this evening.

29:15.080 --> 29:19.080
I'll come by later to
take you down for the biopsy, OK?

29:22.240 --> 29:23.920
You really missed it.

29:23.920 --> 29:25.200
She's got some...

29:25.200 --> 29:26.400
Who cares!

29:26.400 --> 29:29.360
What's your problem?

29:29.360 --> 29:30.720
Finished.

29:30.720 --> 29:34.720
I'm going to die, I know it.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.800
       Pull a seat up here.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.040
You're back.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.360
       What's wrong with it?

29:42.360 --> 29:44.320
No, you've returned. I'm off.

29:44.320 --> 29:47.560
 I'm not feeling too well myself.

29:47.560 --> 29:51.280
I bought Boomer some lunch and then
he got beeped to deliver some twins

29:51.280 --> 29:52.840
so I had to finish both meals myself.

29:52.840 --> 29:54.080
What?

29:54.080 --> 29:57.360
I'm not going to let a ¤3.35
tuna casserole go begging.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.120
No, the twins -
     did you catch the name?

29:59.120 --> 30:02.760
I don't know, Pillman,
Dillman, I don't know...

30:02.760 --> 30:06.760
Hey, finish that up
       for me, will you?

30:15.080 --> 30:16.440
     Marcus coming back today?

30:16.440 --> 30:17.440
I'm afraid not.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.040
Put him in another room?

30:20.040 --> 30:21.920
Where? We'll go see him.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.120
You can't, it's off-limits.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.960
She's lying.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.400
Where did they move him?

30:27.400 --> 30:31.400
Maybe you go somewhere else
after surgery, like Henry.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.240
Marcus is dead.

30:33.240 --> 30:37.240
No way.
She didn't say Marcus was dead.

30:44.600 --> 30:48.600
She didn't say he was alive, either.

30:49.440 --> 30:53.240
             (PANTING)

30:53.240 --> 30:56.400
Doing great, honey. Come on,
15 more seconds and you're out.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.160
Melissa, watch the foetal monitor.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.440
Watch the monitor and see,
you're almost finished.

31:00.440 --> 31:01.880
I can't take the pain any more!

31:01.880 --> 31:04.400
Sure you can, sure you can.
Come on, we're almost there.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.440
And now you've finished,
take a cleansing breath.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.600
The heart rate is accelerated.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.320
The heart rate is accelerated.
              Fiscus?

31:09.320 --> 31:11.200
The heart rate is accelerated.
              Fiscus?
Get him out of here!

31:11.200 --> 31:13.200
             Come on.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.040
Where the hell are you going?

31:15.040 --> 31:16.560
  We're miles away from delivery.

31:16.560 --> 31:20.560
        I'll be right back.

31:22.080 --> 31:24.640
You're close to medical history!
You're going to be the first doctor

31:24.640 --> 31:27.960
to be sued for malpractice
by a patient he never treated.

31:27.960 --> 31:30.080
I know I can't tell them
     why I care so much,

31:30.080 --> 31:31.880
I just want to
make sure my children are fine.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.120
             In here.

31:33.120 --> 31:36.400
Give me the ID.
The ID!

31:36.400 --> 31:39.800
Until these babies are born,
you're a civilian.

31:39.800 --> 31:40.280
Come on.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.880
You're not acting like a doctor,
why should he be treated like one?

31:42.880 --> 31:46.880
         Give me the belt.

32:12.840 --> 32:16.040
Hi.

32:16.040 --> 32:19.000
            Very good.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
All right,
now it's time for the real thing.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.520
         Don't be afraid.

32:30.520 --> 32:31.040
How are you doing?

32:31.040 --> 32:33.680
How are you doing?
I don't know. I ain't a doctor.

32:33.680 --> 32:35.840
Yeah, you ain't lot of things.

32:35.840 --> 32:38.760
Like 14.

32:38.760 --> 32:41.680
I could tell by your X-rays.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.200
So, how old are you? 17? 18?

32:44.200 --> 32:45.560
Don't turn me in.

32:45.560 --> 32:46.640
Why did you lie?

32:46.640 --> 32:48.640
I had to tell the cops
      I'm underage.

32:48.640 --> 32:52.600
If they find out I'm 17 they'll put
me on trial for felony as an adult.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.640
Not a kid.
I don't want to go to jail.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.840
You should have thought about that
before you robbed that liquor store.

32:57.840 --> 32:59.320
Please, don't tell anybody.
Give me a break.

32:59.320 --> 33:00.280
You're going to have to

33:00.280 --> 33:02.200
take responsibility for yourself
 some time.

33:02.200 --> 33:03.240
take responsibility for yourself
 some time.
Please...

33:03.240 --> 33:07.240
You can't always claim you're a kid.
Expect to get off scot-free.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.560
I can't.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.040
I know it's scary
but give it a chance.

33:18.040 --> 33:22.040
    Relax. You'll be all right.

33:22.240 --> 33:26.240
No. Leave me alone.

33:32.280 --> 33:35.720
             (SOBBING)

33:35.720 --> 33:39.720
               What?

33:41.680 --> 33:42.960
Are you all right?

33:42.960 --> 33:44.280
                No.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.880
What's the matter?

33:45.880 --> 33:47.320
What's the matter?
              Cancer.

33:47.320 --> 33:50.440
      I'm filled with cancer.

33:50.440 --> 33:54.440
I see.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.480
          I'm a dead man.

33:56.480 --> 33:59.320
People who have cancer
don't always die from it.

33:59.320 --> 34:01.480
        I got it real bad.

34:01.480 --> 34:04.440
You can't give up. No matter how
tough the fight, hope is still our

34:04.440 --> 34:07.400
greatest weapon against the disease.

34:07.400 --> 34:08.679
I have cancer too.

34:08.679 --> 34:09.800
              You do?

34:09.800 --> 34:11.480
Cancer of the liver.
       Where's yours?

34:11.480 --> 34:15.360
       It started in my arm.

34:15.360 --> 34:18.800
    Then, it must have spread.

34:18.800 --> 34:21.120
             To there.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.440
            My Murphy.

34:23.440 --> 34:24.600
Penis?

34:24.600 --> 34:28.120
  Last night when I was sleeping,

34:28.120 --> 34:32.120
   white stuff leaked out of me.

34:32.679 --> 34:36.679
       I don't want to die!

34:38.760 --> 34:42.080
Did you have a dream last night?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.600
About a sexual encounter, perhaps?

34:43.600 --> 34:44.679
              A what?

34:44.679 --> 34:47.239
Something about a woman?

34:47.239 --> 34:47.760
             Kind of.

34:47.760 --> 34:51.760
             Kind of.
Then my guess, based on dim memory,

34:52.199 --> 34:54.840
is that you had
      a nocturnal emission.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.440
Otherwise known as a wet dream.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.760
    That anything like cancer?

34:58.760 --> 35:02.760
Not in the least. It's the start
of something bigger and much better,

35:03.240 --> 35:05.840
your sexual awakening.

35:05.840 --> 35:08.880
The hormonal springtime.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.960
A vital part of puberty.

35:10.960 --> 35:13.200
You became aroused by the dream,

35:13.200 --> 35:16.080
and your body responded
    to the feeling of pleasure

35:16.080 --> 35:17.240
by having an orgasm.

35:17.240 --> 35:20.000
The white stuff is full of sperm.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.040
The white stuff is full of sperm.
               Wow!

35:21.040 --> 35:23.600
Does that explain things?

35:23.600 --> 35:25.360
            I guess so.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.800
This is only the beginning.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.720
Welcome to manhood.

35:29.720 --> 35:32.680
              Thanks.

35:32.680 --> 35:36.680
Now, let's get you
back to your room.

35:38.680 --> 35:42.680
I wish I could cure
       my cancer as easily.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.560
             Jack?  Mm.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.400
  I've got some bad news for you.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.240
Nick has been released from prison.

35:50.240 --> 35:50.840
What?

35:50.840 --> 35:54.840
The Parole Board decided he's
recognised his guilt as homosexuality

35:54.960 --> 35:57.240
      and feel he's reformed.

35:57.240 --> 36:01.240
After the incident,
he claims that he's found God.

36:02.440 --> 36:03.240
Where is he?

36:03.240 --> 36:07.240
     Somewhere on the streets.

36:08.680 --> 36:12.040
What's wrong with this country?

36:12.040 --> 36:15.080
Can't the system
protect innocent people?

36:15.080 --> 36:16.840
So much for justice.

36:16.840 --> 36:20.840
What am I going to do?

36:24.480 --> 36:26.480
        Helen? Any coffee?

36:26.480 --> 36:27.480
Decaf?

36:27.480 --> 36:31.480
              Great.

36:34.640 --> 36:38.040
       I've lost my marbles.

36:38.040 --> 36:40.040
Everyone feels stressed
from time to time.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.200
Hide out in here
     for as long as you want.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.440
             In 1935,

36:44.440 --> 36:46.720
George Deyton beat me at keepsies.

36:46.720 --> 36:49.000
   He always had the upper hand.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.520
After the fire
that killed my family,

36:52.520 --> 36:56.040
George and I always
shared the same room,

36:56.040 --> 36:58.640
     the shame bed for a year.

36:58.640 --> 37:01.520
We were always in trouble together.

37:01.520 --> 37:05.080
Kids need the opportunity to mess
up. We tell them to learn from us

37:05.080 --> 37:06.920
but they can't, they have
to make their own mistakes.

37:06.920 --> 37:09.800
 My conscience started to emerge.

37:09.800 --> 37:13.240
I always had a streak
of morality in me.

37:13.240 --> 37:17.080
Father McCabe put a fire to it,
but it never happened to George so

37:17.080 --> 37:21.080
I had to decide between what my sense
of right was and my blood brother.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.480
       And he felt betrayed.

37:26.480 --> 37:28.680
         I love that guy,

37:28.680 --> 37:32.120
and I hurt him. I'd like to
make things up with him but I

37:32.120 --> 37:33.800
don't suppose it would make
any difference, would it?

37:33.800 --> 37:37.560
Marcy and I are finally beginning
to understand one another.

37:37.560 --> 37:41.000
It took a real crisis and
several pounds of chocolate but,

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
next time you see your friend,
tell him how you feel.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.240
          Glad he's gone.

37:53.240 --> 37:56.040
With that kind of tobacco
consumption, he's not going

37:56.040 --> 37:57.880
   to see the baby's graduation.

37:57.880 --> 38:01.880
Why do men get out stogies
anyway? No one smokes any more.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.560
Did I tell you I was
going to have twins?

38:04.560 --> 38:08.560
Twice.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.680
Used to be everything was
up in the air until game day.

38:10.680 --> 38:14.680
Now with amnios and sonograms,
there's a lot less mystery.

38:15.680 --> 38:18.440
  I always wanted to be a father.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.000
And play third base for the Bo Sox...

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
    I know my time has passed.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.920
And besides, they got bogs
for at least a generation.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.440
       My kids will be next.

38:30.440 --> 38:34.440
Teach them to keep their head down
for ground balls, hit inside curves.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.360
It's a boy, Captain Walker.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.160
It's a boy!

38:41.160 --> 38:42.000
All right!

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
         Congratulations.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
   So, who do I celebrate with?

38:56.120 --> 39:00.120
      Hope Marcus isn't here.

39:04.520 --> 39:08.520
Come here.

39:29.160 --> 39:33.160
I wonder what it's like being dead.

39:49.600 --> 39:50.760
I told him not to carry a gun.

39:50.760 --> 39:52.040
I told him not to carry a gun.
Who?

39:52.040 --> 39:56.040
All of a sudden, the guy in the
liquor store is pulling a gun.

39:56.960 --> 40:00.960
Then he fires, and Henry fires.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.440
There's Henry,

40:05.440 --> 40:09.160
and he's lying in a pool of blood.

40:09.160 --> 40:13.160
Twitching, and making these noises.

40:14.680 --> 40:18.680
He was my friend.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.160
Ah, Daniel, I've been
looking all over for you.

40:32.160 --> 40:36.000
As I have for you.
How did your meeting go?

40:36.000 --> 40:37.640
Promising.
Yours?

40:37.640 --> 40:39.080
         Hopeful, I think.

40:39.080 --> 40:40.160
What's your plan?

40:40.160 --> 40:41.200
     I'm sure yours is better.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.640
No, No. You first.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.600
          I'd rather not.

40:43.600 --> 40:44.520
Me neither.

40:44.520 --> 40:45.360
               Fine.

40:45.360 --> 40:49.360
Then to hell with you.

40:56.840 --> 40:58.080
Hi.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.600
       Can I take Ryan home?

40:59.600 --> 41:01.600
Well, his lab tests are
looking better and his

41:01.600 --> 41:03.200
blood sugar has levelled out.

41:03.200 --> 41:06.200
Doesn't seem to show any adverse
effects from the insulin, so...

41:06.200 --> 41:10.200
as long as you stay close to a
family doctor, he's all yours.

41:11.560 --> 41:14.000
       In summer we used to

41:14.000 --> 41:16.360
come by this hospital
on the way home from Fenway.

41:16.360 --> 41:19.640
Exhausted from all that hollering.

41:19.640 --> 41:22.480
I felt we'd been part of something.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.320
Good days.

41:25.320 --> 41:28.880
  Friendships are rare, you know?

41:28.880 --> 41:29.880
     Never had one like ours.

41:29.880 --> 41:32.960
     Never had one like ours.
Neither have I.

41:32.960 --> 41:35.760
We ought to plan to get together
every now and then.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.040
            Old times.

41:37.040 --> 41:39.400
Yeah, sure. Sounds good to me.

41:39.400 --> 41:40.440
            I'll call.

41:40.440 --> 41:44.440
Maybe you call. Whichever.
Terrific.

41:45.240 --> 41:49.240
            Take care.

42:00.120 --> 42:02.080
Hey, Dr Fiscus, wait up.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.880
I'd like to have a word with you.

42:03.880 --> 42:06.680
Melissa and the kids,
they're doing fine.

42:06.680 --> 42:09.000
           That's nice.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.040
I am sorry I punched you yesterday.

42:11.040 --> 42:15.040
Dr Morrison told me the reason
for your stupid behaviour.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.520
            It's fine.

42:17.520 --> 42:19.120
I realise the children aren't mine.

42:19.120 --> 42:22.040
I accept reality.
Now leave me alone.

42:22.040 --> 42:26.040
Look, when we found out
we couldn't have kids, and

42:26.640 --> 42:29.960
it was my fault...
  It hits a man where he lives.

42:29.960 --> 42:33.960
it's so hard accepting someone
else father of your children.

42:36.640 --> 42:39.600
You did us an extraordinary favour.

42:39.600 --> 42:42.280
I'll be grateful to you for ever.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.720
But I can't live my life wondering
if you're standing in the dark

42:44.720 --> 42:48.360
looking through the bushes
    at the babies.

42:48.360 --> 42:52.120
I need your word you
won't ever try to see them.

42:52.120 --> 42:55.440
            I promise.

42:55.440 --> 42:59.440
Well then, come with me.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.280
Come on, Rye Crisp.

43:05.280 --> 43:08.040
Jam that baby in.

43:08.040 --> 43:11.800
Two...

43:11.800 --> 43:12.240
Hey, Mike, where you going?

43:12.240 --> 43:14.360
Hey, Mike, where you going?
Leaving the kiddy ward.

43:14.360 --> 43:15.040
Why?

43:15.040 --> 43:16.200
Why?
I don't belong here.

43:16.200 --> 43:20.200
I'm 17. I'm supposed to be in adult.

43:20.200 --> 43:22.800
Henry'll never get any older.

43:22.800 --> 43:24.440
Come on.

43:24.440 --> 43:28.120
Give yourself the old spike.

43:28.120 --> 43:29.320
Wait a minute.

43:29.320 --> 43:30.600
You can do it.

43:30.600 --> 43:31.840
It's gonna hurt!

43:31.840 --> 43:35.840
It's gonna hurt!
Gotta grow up.

43:45.000 --> 43:49.000
Look, I'll scream for you,
    all right?

44:03.440 --> 44:07.440
Push the stuff in. Ry, man!

44:09.320 --> 44:13.320
He can do this solo.

44:18.240 --> 44:20.880
Wicked!

44:20.880 --> 44:24.880
No problem!

44:32.400 --> 44:36.400
Meet Darcy Tillman.

44:38.720 --> 44:42.720
And Kyle Tillman.

44:46.360 --> 44:48.240
        They're beautiful.

44:48.240 --> 44:52.240
Wait. I'm not finished.

44:53.400 --> 44:56.600
This is CJ Tillman.

44:56.600 --> 45:00.600
           A hat-trick!

45:02.000 --> 45:05.520
   A few months ago I was shot.

45:05.520 --> 45:08.320
   Almost never opened my eyes.

45:08.320 --> 45:12.320
And when I did,
all I saw was a dead world.

45:12.920 --> 45:16.640
People discarded like trash on the
streets, friends growing bitter and

45:16.640 --> 45:18.880
       strung out on drugs.

45:18.880 --> 45:22.880
The ER overflowing and under
financial pressure to cut back.

45:23.520 --> 45:25.320
          I lost hope and

45:25.320 --> 45:29.320
became as negative as
the world around me.

45:30.800 --> 45:34.400
But I'm beginning to see I was
given a second chance at life,

45:34.400 --> 45:36.520
   so that I could participate.

45:36.520 --> 45:40.200
       To add, not subtract.

45:40.200 --> 45:44.200
  Tinker...to Evers...to Chance.

45:46.560 --> 46:24.000
               Wow!
