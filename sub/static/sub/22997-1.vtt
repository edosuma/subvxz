01:43.803 --> 01:45.437
How about you unlock this door.

01:47.407 --> 01:49.741
And we can have the most
wonderful time of the year.

01:52.312 --> 01:53.992
You're never getting
out of this jail cell.

01:54.981 --> 01:55.981
Hmm.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.785
You're playing hard to get.

02:02.755 --> 02:05.357
You like the anticipation

02:06.426 --> 02:08.860
before you get the presents.

02:09.429 --> 02:10.529
Right?

02:20.707 --> 02:22.608
How long do you think
it's gonna be

02:23.776 --> 02:25.978
before daddy comes to get me?

02:27.513 --> 02:29.548
- Never.
- Hmm.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.984
See, we hit him.
And he's hurt.

02:33.286 --> 02:36.355
And sooner or later,
he's gotta go get help,

02:36.357 --> 02:38.023
and when he does,
he's gonna slip up.

02:39.525 --> 02:40.959
And I'm gonna be there
to nail him.

02:43.596 --> 02:45.430
The only place
that you two are going...

02:46.466 --> 02:47.733
Is to the chair.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.089
<i>Confirm 187
in Woodridge mall parking lot.</i>

04:17.091 --> 04:19.591
<i>CSU currently processing scene.</i>

04:19.593 --> 04:20.959
<i>Sheriff Mitchell arriving now.</i>

04:23.930 --> 04:24.996
Here ya go, chief.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.600
What is it?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.001
It's an eggnog latte.

04:30.837 --> 04:31.837
It's festive.

04:34.907 --> 04:35.974
Okay, what've we got?

04:37.577 --> 04:38.577
Dead guy.

04:38.579 --> 04:41.780
Yeah, your years of police
training served you well then.

04:42.014 --> 04:44.549
Well, we're calling in
for prints and fibers but...

04:44.551 --> 04:45.884
Anything?

04:45.886 --> 04:47.519
Kinda hard to get prints
in the snow.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.621
- Car?
- Yep.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.057
<i>That's it, right over there
in the parking lot.</i>

04:52.458 --> 04:53.825
<i>- Got the keys on him?
- No.</i>

04:53.827 --> 04:55.127
So do we have a cause of death?

04:57.865 --> 04:59.531
Well, I'm not a doctor but...

05:00.767 --> 05:02.100
There's the body.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.735
And his head is that.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.738
Jesus...

05:11.545 --> 05:12.577
Is there anything else?

05:12.579 --> 05:14.646
Actually, yeah. Dave!

05:14.648 --> 05:15.914
Yes, deputy Fullard?

05:17.116 --> 05:18.116
Thanks.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.421
Want me to run it up?

05:22.423 --> 05:24.990
Yeah. See if we can pull
some DNA off this.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.525
Hey, can you run
that up, please?

05:26.527 --> 05:28.160
- Yes sir.
- Thanks.

05:29.462 --> 05:30.982
Listen, sheriff,
what are you thinking?

05:32.198 --> 05:33.198
Nothing good.

05:37.937 --> 05:39.604
You're not really him.

05:47.814 --> 05:50.182
There you are!

06:11.237 --> 06:12.537
<i>Tell me!</i>

06:12.539 --> 06:15.640
<i>You seem to have the answers
for everything.</i>

06:16.542 --> 06:18.810
<i>Why don't you do
what you always promised?</i>

06:18.812 --> 06:20.846
<i>Don't punish me for working!</i>

06:21.147 --> 06:22.481
<i>I got you everything!</i>

06:22.849 --> 06:24.216
<i>What do you want?</i>

06:31.491 --> 06:32.891
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

06:44.505 --> 06:46.738
<i>I never see you.
You're never home for dinner.</i>

06:47.640 --> 06:49.975
<i>She waited for you
and I've had it!</i>

06:55.047 --> 06:56.181
If this is happening...

06:56.816 --> 06:57.949
If this is what you want...

06:58.618 --> 06:59.985
We should do what?

06:59.987 --> 07:01.553
We need to tell her!

07:02.622 --> 07:03.655
Hey, sweetheart.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.991
Felt sure you were
never getting up.

07:06.692 --> 07:09.227
Yeah, well, I decided
to grace you with my presence.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.862
It's Christmas, after all.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.307
I need to be moving.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.545
Okay.

07:26.547 --> 07:26.545
<i>Coming up to eight o'clock and we're
just getting a travel report...</i>

07:26.547 --> 07:32.117
<i>woodridge mall, due
to a police investigation</i>

07:32.119 --> 07:33.818
<i>in the mall parking lot...</i>

07:34.186 --> 07:35.787
What?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.088
Doesn't matter.

07:37.590 --> 07:40.191
Come on, you got something
to say, just say it.

07:40.860 --> 07:41.927
This is bullshit.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.128
- Jen!
- What?

07:43.130 --> 07:45.297
I don't like that
kind of language.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.565
Mom, what is this?

07:47.033 --> 07:49.267
It's... complicated.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.169
It's divorce, mom.
I know what it is.

07:53.005 --> 07:54.105
- Frank and i...
- Frank?!

07:54.607 --> 07:56.708
You've stopped
calling him dad already?

07:57.343 --> 08:00.845
We feel that it would be easier
to just get through Christmas

08:00.847 --> 08:02.881
- and then we can...
- Just split?

08:04.116 --> 08:07.786
We all want a nice family
Christmas together.

08:07.788 --> 08:08.753
Right?

08:08.755 --> 08:08.753
<i>Insisting the mall is open,</i>

08:08.755 --> 08:13.625
<i>despite the ongoing
police investigation there.</i>

08:14.126 --> 08:16.728
We're only doing this
because we love you, sweetheart.

08:18.798 --> 08:19.798
It's a lie, mom.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.266
It's not even a good one.

08:24.136 --> 08:25.236
I'm gonna be late.

08:25.671 --> 08:26.671
Jennifer...

09:18.024 --> 09:19.924
No Santa.

09:19.926 --> 09:22.827
So I guess that means no work
for you too, huh?

09:23.195 --> 09:24.963
Guess so.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.232
That's what I should ask Santa
for: All play and no work.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.068
I have no idea what
I want for Christmas.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.337
Uh, a boyfriend
with a huge cock.

09:32.805 --> 09:34.406
Hasn't he stiffed you
enough on that one?

09:35.007 --> 09:36.841
A girl can dream, can't I?

09:36.843 --> 09:38.376
Dream about what, babe?

09:38.378 --> 09:40.278
About what I
really want for Christmas.

09:40.713 --> 09:43.682
- Is it perfume?
- Yeah, it's perfume, Joe.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.283
I thought you guys
weren't doing the mall.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.252
Well, Lancelot had
to see his maiden.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.154
You're so weird.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.389
- Good weird?
- There is no good weird.

09:52.024 --> 09:54.104
David's on his way up.
Hey, did you guys see the lot?

09:54.193 --> 09:56.127
- No.
- Police everywhere.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.395
- Why?
- Dead guy.

09:57.797 --> 09:58.963
Who?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.834
- No way.
- -Yeah.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.836
Probably got drunk
and broke his neck or something.

10:05.137 --> 10:06.438
Holy shit!

10:06.440 --> 10:07.839
Don't!

10:08.340 --> 10:10.742
- Jen starts as an elf tomorrow.
- Sweet.

10:10.876 --> 10:13.344
My mom thought it would
take my mind off things.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.779
Hey, I thought that was my job.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.816
Hey. What's happening?

10:17.950 --> 10:19.818
Jen's impending job as an elf.

10:19.985 --> 10:21.086
The kids love me.

10:21.487 --> 10:22.487
They shouldn't.

10:24.256 --> 10:25.490
The kids shouldn't love me?

10:25.492 --> 10:27.792
No, no.
Not... not you, babe.

10:27.794 --> 10:28.960
Christmas.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.495
Why can't kids love Christmas?

10:30.497 --> 10:32.864
- Yeah, man, what gives?
- They're being lied to.

10:33.099 --> 10:35.033
Seems like a pretty
harmless lie.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.837
Really? Sitting on some fat
guy's lap all day, huh?

10:38.839 --> 10:41.406
Sounds like a pedophile's
dream to me.

10:41.408 --> 10:44.042
Please don't make Christmas anymore
depressing than it already is.

10:44.044 --> 10:48.012
That's why we should totally
have our party on Christmas Eve!

10:48.380 --> 10:50.248
- Party?
- Yeah. It's, uh...

10:50.250 --> 10:52.517
- It's called drum fest.
- Drum fest?

10:53.185 --> 10:55.487
Yeah, it's a drumming competition
happening down at Phil's bar.

10:55.489 --> 10:56.521
This is really lame.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.990
I have training for
the swim meet that night.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.391
Besides, we're not gonna get in.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.993
You can miss one day
of training.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.895
Phil is calling it
a private affair.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.977
The bar's closed to anyone
who doesn't have a ticket.

11:06.198 --> 11:07.465
But I don't have a ticket.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.534
There aren't actually
any tickets.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.369
He just wants to call it
a ticket-only affair.

11:12.037 --> 11:13.938
Oh, that reminds me.

11:13.940 --> 11:17.509
I need a lead groupie, you know,
just to tell me how great I am.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.778
- Oh, how could a girl say no?
- Me, too.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.881
You don't even play the drums.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.483
Well, no, but I have a pretty
sick iTunes playlist

11:25.485 --> 11:27.152
and maybe I'll let you
hear it if...

11:27.154 --> 11:29.254
If what?
I lose my phone?

11:29.256 --> 11:33.424
We're having an annual boyfriend
review on January 1st, Joe,

11:33.426 --> 11:35.360
and you seriously
need to up your game.

11:37.797 --> 11:38.797
Babe?

11:42.468 --> 11:44.536
- She'll be back.
- Sure, man.

11:45.838 --> 11:46.838
Sure.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.389
You want me to close the mall?

12:05.357 --> 12:06.357
Morning, Bob.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.197
I'm considering it.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.965
- Considering?
- Yeah.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.967
Is the killer in the mall?

12:15.969 --> 12:17.068
No.

12:18.137 --> 12:19.237
Then why close it?

12:19.239 --> 12:21.973
Bob, this is a serious situation
and I'm trying to prevent...

12:21.975 --> 12:24.275
How long you been
in this town, sheriff?

12:25.244 --> 12:26.411
Thirty years.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.247
We like to keep things
simple here in Woodridge.

12:30.049 --> 12:32.250
Simply put,
a man's been murdered.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.986
Yeah, and I hope you catch
the son of a bitch.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.956
But we do not want
to start a panic now, do we?

12:38.958 --> 12:40.592
So you want me
to conduct this manhunt

12:40.594 --> 12:42.060
with one hand tied
behind my back?

12:42.862 --> 12:44.395
I want you to do your job,
sheriff.

12:45.331 --> 12:48.233
As always, Bob,
your leadership is inspiring.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.239
Have a productive day, sheriff.

12:54.573 --> 12:55.607
Asshole.

13:05.150 --> 13:08.987
<i>Wrpt Woodridge,
for all you couples looking</i>

13:08.989 --> 13:11.522
<i>to have some hot fun
together tonight...</i>

13:14.627 --> 13:16.494
- Jesus.
- Shit.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.332
What, uh, seems to be
the problem, officer?

13:22.368 --> 13:25.970
Yeah, I'm looking
for "old romantic 1980."

13:25.972 --> 13:26.972
Is that you?

13:27.606 --> 13:28.640
What?

13:28.642 --> 13:30.141
Yeah, man, we met online.

13:30.509 --> 13:31.509
Chat room.

13:32.444 --> 13:33.511
Are you serious?

13:34.380 --> 13:36.281
No, dipshit.
I'm joking.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.150
You two shouldn't be out here.

13:40.252 --> 13:41.619
It ain't illegal.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.155
What's that?
Call her parents?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.691
Uh, what he means, sir, is we're
not doing anybody any harm.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.053
And where do your parents
think you are?

13:49.361 --> 13:50.595
It's Christmas.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.397
You're a few days
out there, kid.

13:53.098 --> 13:54.332
All right, look.

13:54.334 --> 13:58.336
I'm heading out to Mcdermott's
place, checking on a call.

13:59.104 --> 14:00.271
I'll be about an hour.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.439
Okay.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.709
"So you'll be gone
when I get back," okay.

14:05.644 --> 14:06.644
Okay.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.680
Have a good evening, sir.

14:08.682 --> 14:09.981
Yeah.

14:09.983 --> 14:14.419
Shit. That was close.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.955
- Yeah.
- Think he's gone already?

14:16.957 --> 14:19.057
- Give him a chance, Troy.
- Okay.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.260
Maybe we should go.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.022
You heard him.
He's gonna be back in an hour.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.434
Come on, look, I'll let you
drive my car a bit.

14:30.135 --> 14:32.036
It's your dad's car, Troy.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.305
Well, I'll let you
play with my gears.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.107
It's an automatic.

14:39.611 --> 14:40.611
What was that?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.648
- What?
- There was a noise.

14:44.616 --> 14:47.719
- Babe, please.
- Don't, "babe, please" me.

14:47.721 --> 14:51.756
I'm taking you on your word that you're not
still fully hung up on your ex-girlfriend.

14:52.291 --> 14:53.758
- Jen?
- Yeah, Jen.

14:54.426 --> 14:56.427
Sweetheart, she means
nothing to me.

14:59.465 --> 15:02.400
There. Underneath the car.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.668
It's probably just a raccoon.

15:04.603 --> 15:05.770
Do you still wanna do this?

15:06.705 --> 15:08.339
I don't know.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.641
Babe, you're the only one for me.
There's nobody else.

15:11.710 --> 15:15.313
Mmm. Say more things
like that.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.749
The worst that could happen
is you get pregnant.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.684
I'm on birth control, you moron.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.719
Well, then what else
could go wrong?

15:21.721 --> 15:24.555
I have no idea why I love you.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.491
Baby, you...

15:32.798 --> 15:34.632
Shit!

15:34.634 --> 15:37.335
Get us out of here!

15:37.337 --> 15:39.570
It won't start.
There's no battery!

15:39.572 --> 15:41.672
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

15:44.110 --> 15:47.512
- Get out!
- My door is jammed!

15:50.083 --> 15:51.649
No!

16:56.682 --> 16:58.883
- Sheriff.
- Fullard.

17:01.553 --> 17:02.653
It's a mess.

17:03.555 --> 17:06.190
- Who?
- Two kids. Teenagers.

17:06.758 --> 17:08.126
What happened?

17:08.127 --> 17:11.295
Be a couple days before the
fire inspector gets back to us.

17:11.896 --> 17:14.565
Kathy says you saw them before.
Called something in.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.267
Didn't you recognize them?

17:17.435 --> 17:20.137
They're just kids.
I... I don't know...

17:20.140 --> 17:21.739
Come on, it's a small town.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.643
Look, sheriff, I haven't
been here as long as...

17:26.411 --> 17:27.411
Some people.

17:29.681 --> 17:30.882
Anything back on the DNA?

17:32.284 --> 17:34.352
Sent to the state
lab last night.

17:34.753 --> 17:36.713
You know we're not gonna be
first priority though.

17:37.189 --> 17:38.222
We might be.

17:40.826 --> 17:42.593
You don't think this is
connected to that?

17:43.495 --> 17:44.762
Completely different mos?

17:49.434 --> 17:51.034
I don't know what
I'm thinking right now.

17:52.371 --> 17:54.739
Only I was looking forward
to a quiet holiday season.

17:57.376 --> 17:59.177
Still haven't done my shopping.

17:59.179 --> 18:02.847
I don't two mur... three murders
dragging us into overtime.

18:10.489 --> 18:11.956
Look, it might be a coincidence.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.324
No such thing.

18:40.852 --> 18:42.787
Who could that be?

18:48.961 --> 18:50.328
Can I help you?

18:50.330 --> 18:51.729
Mrs. Frenchen?

18:52.331 --> 18:53.698
Yes?

18:53.700 --> 18:57.735
I'm in need of a good lawyer
and you came highly recommended.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.004
Could you open the door?

19:00.006 --> 19:02.506
I'm afraid I just
specialize in divorce.

19:02.508 --> 19:05.610
Well, then you're exactly
the person I'm looking for.

19:06.545 --> 19:10.548
You see, Santa, he told me he wouldn't
buy me a bear trap for Christmas.

19:11.350 --> 19:14.518
I reckon that's grounds
for divorce, right?

19:14.520 --> 19:16.320
You can come
by my office next week.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.082
I'd be happy to take a look
at what you need.

19:18.624 --> 19:22.460
I'm afraid there's a real bad time
limit on what I need you for.

19:27.933 --> 19:28.933
Who are you?

19:29.968 --> 19:32.870
Why, I'm Mrs.
Claus, of course.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.565
Tell me what you think
about my elf hair.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.969
So, Santa asked you
to sit on his lap?

20:05.437 --> 20:06.904
Please. If that asshole
hits on me again,

20:06.906 --> 20:08.539
I'm gonna pepper spray his ass.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.541
Is Lisa coming?

20:10.543 --> 20:11.676
Swim practice.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.577
That's dedication.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.413
She's gonna be selected
for the Olympic squad

20:15.415 --> 20:17.782
and we're still gonna be
stuck here in this mall.

20:17.784 --> 20:20.885
Speak for yourself. If they start
giving out gold medals for blow jobs...

20:20.887 --> 20:23.654
I'm going to Reicher's
bar later.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.656
- Do you wanna come?
- You're not gonna get served.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.992
Please! I have boobs.
Boys are dumb.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.827
- Hmm. No debate here.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.462
Hey, Jen, your break's finished.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.930
Hey, Jen...

20:32.932 --> 20:35.066
If you hate it so much,

20:35.068 --> 20:39.003
- why'd you come back? -It's either that or
join in on my family's awkward silences

20:39.005 --> 20:41.605
it's definitely happening then?

20:41.607 --> 20:43.841
The divorce?
God, I hope so.

20:44.710 --> 20:46.811
At least then we won't
have to play happy family.

20:48.547 --> 20:50.014
What's that?

20:50.016 --> 20:53.050
Oh, Joe and David wanted me
to hand these out.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.920
Well, aren't you
a good girlfriend?

20:55.922 --> 20:58.622
It's an annual tradition.

20:58.624 --> 21:01.659
- Being a good girlfriend?
- I'm an amazing girlfriend.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.561
He's so fucking lucky.

21:04.062 --> 21:05.930
And, no, the party is
an annual tradition.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.732
It's a stupid tradition.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.034
- Says the girl who's
dressed like an elf.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.971
Did you, um,
did you hear about Troy?

21:14.706 --> 21:15.773
No.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.142
He... died last night,

21:18.144 --> 21:20.945
in an accident
with Michelle Weaver.

21:21.079 --> 21:22.780
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah.

21:24.750 --> 21:27.118
Did you guys... um...

21:28.787 --> 21:30.588
Did you guys, like, do it?

21:30.989 --> 21:33.557
No, we... we only went out
for, like, three weeks.

21:33.559 --> 21:36.627
It's fine. In three weeks, I totally
would have fucked him, like, 30 times.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.162
Well, I didn't really
like him that much.

21:38.164 --> 21:39.663
Who said anything
about liking him?

21:39.665 --> 21:41.499
Well, what kind of accident?

21:41.501 --> 21:44.435
- I don't really know.
- I hope his family's okay.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.578
<i>Confirmation from the fire
department on two dead.</i>

21:54.580 --> 21:56.414
<i>Looks like it was deliberate.</i>

21:56.416 --> 21:58.516
<i>Traces of gas have been
found at the scene.</i>

22:05.090 --> 22:06.090
What?

22:06.625 --> 22:07.725
Uh...

22:08.794 --> 22:10.461
Come on.
Spit it out, Fullard.

22:11.096 --> 22:13.497
Manny was speaking
with the fire inspector.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.599
It's early, but he thinks
it was deliberate.

22:16.067 --> 22:17.935
Found traces
of gas on the ground

22:18.570 --> 22:20.070
and the starter cables were cut.

22:20.739 --> 22:22.106
Shit.

22:22.574 --> 22:24.875
It might not be related
to the Santa Claus at the mall.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.110
Oh, come on.

22:27.679 --> 22:28.999
What are you thinking?

22:31.049 --> 22:32.817
Like a serial killer?

22:32.984 --> 22:36.654
Hey, I don't want anyone speaking
those words out loud, you got it?

22:38.123 --> 22:40.024
- Then what?
- I don't know.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.761
Let's just take it easy
and compile evidence.

22:44.162 --> 22:45.729
Better yet, a suspect list.

22:45.964 --> 22:47.444
Wait, shouldn't they
have the same mo?

22:47.899 --> 22:49.900
They do.
They're all dead.

22:49.902 --> 22:51.535
Uh, mayor's office called.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.571
They're worried about
Christmas being ruined.

22:53.573 --> 22:56.207
Kathy, can you get NYPD homicide
on the line, please?

22:57.042 --> 22:59.577
He's been on line two
for five minutes.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.899
You know he called you
the Grinch?

23:01.046 --> 23:03.614
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

23:03.616 --> 23:06.517
I got three murders in two nights and he's
worried about people not spending enough?

23:06.885 --> 23:07.852
Kathy!

23:07.854 --> 23:09.753
Line two!

23:10.088 --> 23:11.121
He hung up!

23:11.857 --> 23:13.123
Okay, I'll get him back.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.661
Hey, don't shoot the messenger.

23:17.663 --> 23:20.498
I think the mayor's just worried
that one of the victims is a voter.

23:20.999 --> 23:22.199
Doesn't wanna lose too many.

23:22.701 --> 23:24.168
Kathy! Get me the bureau!

23:30.809 --> 23:31.909
Feds?

23:33.144 --> 23:34.879
Yeah, we're out of our depth
on this one.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.885
- What do you need?
- A drink.

23:45.023 --> 23:46.123
I'm okay.

23:59.004 --> 24:01.105
Told Joe to fuck right off,
you know what I mean?

24:01.107 --> 24:02.806
- Oh my god!
- All right.

24:02.808 --> 24:04.208
Cheers ladies!

24:07.679 --> 24:09.613
Okay.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.375
This one's totally going
on my Facebook wall.

24:12.150 --> 24:14.552
Don't tag me.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.186
My boyfriend thinks
I'm babysitting.

24:16.188 --> 24:19.023
Yeah. My mom thinks
I'm studying.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.992
Hey, beautiful lady!

24:22.327 --> 24:24.228
- Hey, lady!
- Oh god.

24:24.230 --> 24:26.864
- Hey, sexy lady! Whoo!
- Great.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.999
The last thing I want
right now is to be hit on.

24:29.001 --> 24:31.335
Funny, that's the first
thing that I want.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.673
Why don't we go to the sun house?
I have the key.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.241
We'd have the whole place
to ourselves.

24:38.109 --> 24:39.209
What's there?

24:39.811 --> 24:40.945
More alcohol.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.813
Hey, hot mama!

24:42.815 --> 24:43.815
Sure.

24:44.683 --> 24:46.617
Probably a small cock anyway.

24:48.053 --> 24:49.333
I'm just gonna use the bathroom.

24:52.357 --> 24:54.124
Let's not stay here alone.

24:57.729 --> 24:59.889
Maybe we should have sacrificed
Courtney to those guys.

25:01.132 --> 25:03.734
Wow. Remind me why
we're friends again?

25:14.746 --> 25:15.746
Hello?

25:19.351 --> 25:21.719
Are you okay?

25:22.387 --> 25:24.855
Honey, honey.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.223
Are you okay?

25:38.771 --> 25:40.938
Oh my god! Oh, my god!

25:40.940 --> 25:42.740
Please, no!

26:17.309 --> 26:18.309
No!

26:30.922 --> 26:33.223
But baby, I wanna play!

26:33.225 --> 26:34.725
Let's not be greedy,
Mrs. Claus.

26:38.329 --> 26:40.798
Four birds.
Four birds.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.433
'Tis more than enough
for one day.

26:54.012 --> 26:55.212
So, Santa Claus?

26:58.016 --> 26:59.249
And Mrs. Claus?

27:05.490 --> 27:07.958
Do you know why
they didn't hurt you?

27:13.431 --> 27:14.431
One sec, okay?

27:20.839 --> 27:21.839
Talk to me.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.341
Four dead girls.

27:24.909 --> 27:27.344
- Girls?
- Yeah, teenagers.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.880
- Underage.
- Shit.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.317
She say anything?

27:34.753 --> 27:37.354
Yeah, something about two freaks

27:37.356 --> 27:39.490
dressed up as
Mr. and Mrs. Claus.

27:39.492 --> 27:41.158
At least the mayor's
gonna love that.

27:41.926 --> 27:44.086
Never mind the press. We need
to start running with it.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.190
Get as much as you can on them.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.399
Mayor's on the line.
He wants to talk to you.

27:50.969 --> 27:52.302
That was fast. Jesus.

27:52.871 --> 27:54.171
Get on the horn, right now.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.906
Get the mall to pull
their Santa Claus off.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.007
What?

27:57.009 --> 27:59.943
Before some yahoo
blows his fucking brains out.

27:59.945 --> 28:02.045
No, we've got
media blackout on this.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.380
Oh, really?

28:03.782 --> 28:05.516
Twitter and Facebook disagree.

28:14.025 --> 28:15.125
Pigs.

28:22.834 --> 28:24.434
Why don't we call
your parents now, okay?

28:30.141 --> 28:31.241
Or I can.

28:55.266 --> 28:56.967
Santa Claus?

28:57.535 --> 28:59.436
He's dressed as
fucking Santa Claus?

29:00.038 --> 29:01.104
Yes.

29:01.840 --> 29:02.873
God damn it.

29:03.141 --> 29:04.408
I'm gonna put a curfew in place.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.843
- Excuse me?
- A curfew.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.619
There's no evidence these two
are related, is there?

29:10.215 --> 29:11.448
With all due respect, Mr. mayor,

29:11.450 --> 29:13.283
you're not a law
enforcement officer.

29:13.285 --> 29:16.420
No, I'm the mayor, and somebody
has to run this town.

29:18.289 --> 29:20.591
Do you have any idea what will
happen to Christmas sales

29:20.593 --> 29:22.292
if you close that mall?

29:22.294 --> 29:24.962
If people keep dying, there
won't be any customers left.

29:24.964 --> 29:29.132
You get your ass out there and
you find this guy and this girl

29:29.134 --> 29:31.969
and you lock 'em up
and you throw away the key.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.872
In the meantime,
you let me run this town.

29:35.073 --> 29:37.274
- Bob! We have to come to...
- That's enough!

29:38.009 --> 29:41.912
I was selected on a platform of decency
and promoting family values in Woodridge.

29:42.647 --> 29:45.048
These murders are
fucking that image up.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.484
Aren't you going to
a strip club this week?

29:47.486 --> 29:50.354
Yeah, because I put money
in the local economy.

29:50.588 --> 29:54.258
I support local business and I
get to see the voters up close.

29:54.592 --> 29:56.627
Very close up, I'm sure.

29:57.428 --> 29:58.528
Yeah.

29:59.097 --> 30:01.298
I am particularly looking
forward to...

30:02.066 --> 30:03.400
Seeing my niece.

30:04.335 --> 30:05.569
Who's all grown up now.

30:06.104 --> 30:08.405
Just starting at vixens.

30:09.173 --> 30:12.509
Excuse me.
I have an investigation to run.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.244
And I've got a town to run.

30:14.946 --> 30:17.047
And you will not pull Santa
out of that mall.

30:17.515 --> 30:19.182
You will double his security.

30:19.184 --> 30:20.184
Is that clear?

30:21.519 --> 30:22.519
Good.

30:29.260 --> 30:31.695
<i>Dispatch, this is unit 215.</i>

30:31.697 --> 30:34.398
<i>The feds have arrived.
It looks like the cavalry</i>

30:34.400 --> 30:35.966
<i>made it just before
the snow drifts</i>

30:35.968 --> 30:38.135
<i>completely cut the roads off.</i>

30:38.137 --> 30:40.170
<i>Copy that, 215.</i>

30:40.172 --> 30:42.172
<i>I guess we'll have to make some
room in the office.</i>

30:42.707 --> 30:44.274
<i>10-4.</i>

30:44.276 --> 30:46.043
<i>- So how many?
- Seven.</i>

30:46.678 --> 30:50.147
The four girls, a young
couple, and Santa.

30:50.149 --> 30:51.315
Missing a number.

30:51.317 --> 30:52.449
Excuse me?

30:54.018 --> 30:56.286
One, two and four.

30:57.288 --> 30:59.389
Shit, are you saying there could
be three more bodies out there?

30:59.391 --> 31:01.258
It's highly possible.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.327
Perhaps a remote
or isolated location.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.288
Might just be that we
haven't found them yet.

31:06.197 --> 31:08.037
These descriptions
of the killers are accurate?

31:08.666 --> 31:09.700
Oh, they're accurate.

31:12.403 --> 31:14.404
Those are from
the CCTV last night.

31:15.073 --> 31:16.540
Not saying they're
easy to swallow.

31:19.410 --> 31:23.246
Okay, the lady.
We figure mid-twenties.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.516
She's Mrs. Claus, for lack
of a better explanation.

31:27.085 --> 31:28.552
The guy? Well, Santa.

31:29.253 --> 31:30.520
Is he as big as Santa?

31:30.522 --> 31:33.390
About 30 to 40
years of age, we figure.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.692
Ex-military?
Former cop?

31:35.694 --> 31:37.527
Somebody who has the ability
to move quickly.

31:37.529 --> 31:38.769
And take multiple victims down.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.064
Yeah. This Mrs. Claus
is just for show.

31:41.066 --> 31:44.067
She's like, um,
letting off a stun grenade.

31:45.003 --> 31:46.470
This guy's the real deal.

31:46.704 --> 31:48.405
Okay.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.375
Well, we can't release any information
on the killer to the press.

31:51.377 --> 31:53.310
What?

31:53.312 --> 31:55.712
If he doesn't know we're onto
him, he'll keep using the suit.

31:56.214 --> 31:57.781
May be a good way to spot him.

31:57.783 --> 32:00.017
Oh, so just look for a guy
in a Santa suit at Christmas?

32:00.418 --> 32:02.686
To be honest, I don't think
this guy cares.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.187
Why do you say that?

32:04.189 --> 32:06.189
'Cause he let a girl
live to tell a tale.

32:06.524 --> 32:08.458
He wants people to know.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.560
You don't have to pander
to that.

32:10.562 --> 32:13.063
Yeah, but that may make him keep killing
until he gets the recognition he wants.

32:13.664 --> 32:16.433
Let's have a tight control on
information out to the public here.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.168
This is a small town.

32:18.170 --> 32:18.168
Come on, guys.
People are talking already.

32:18.170 --> 32:22.239
Either way, you need to find who
the victims were on the third day

32:22.241 --> 32:24.541
because there seems to be
a piece of this puzzle missing.

32:24.742 --> 32:27.344
- And we'll need your men on it.
- Oh, great.

32:27.346 --> 32:28.779
Go door to door if you have to.

32:28.781 --> 32:31.415
- It's a big town.
- You said it was a small town.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.750
I suggest you get every
available man on it.

32:33.752 --> 32:35.992
Find out if anyone has gone
missing in the last few days.

32:40.258 --> 32:42.726
I don't suppose you guys
want to lend a hand, do ya?

32:42.728 --> 32:45.262
"Many hands make light work,"
isn't that what they say?

32:45.663 --> 32:49.232
Between the training experience
myself and the other agents have,

32:49.234 --> 32:51.435
us doing grunt work would
be a poor use of our time.

32:51.669 --> 32:53.570
I'm sure your deputies
are more than capable.

32:54.338 --> 32:56.306
We'll stay here
and review the evidence.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.407
Okay, okay.

32:58.476 --> 32:59.810
What else do you need?

33:00.211 --> 33:02.079
How about a connection
between the victims.

33:02.081 --> 33:03.847
We need to understand
how he's choosing them.

33:04.715 --> 33:06.850
He's targeting them at night.
We know that much, at least.

33:06.852 --> 33:08.452
Nah, there's something else.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.287
They didn't know each other.
None of them did.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.689
And I can't establish any other
connection between them.

33:12.691 --> 33:14.825
Hey, hey. We're not here
to step on anyone's toes.

33:14.827 --> 33:18.562
Neither am I! I'm just trying
to catch this fucking guy!

33:19.464 --> 33:22.466
Guys, the clock's ticking.
This guy's killing every day.

33:25.503 --> 33:26.783
I'll double the patrols
at night.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.500
The curfew'll go into effect.

33:31.776 --> 33:34.244
Remember sheriff, you called us.

35:44.475 --> 35:45.475
Klein.

35:46.744 --> 35:48.545
Yeah, I'm at the Frenchen
residence.

35:52.550 --> 35:53.750
We've got three dead bodies.

35:55.319 --> 35:56.419
Yup.

35:57.688 --> 35:59.789
The mom, Mrs. Frenchen,
the daughter...

36:00.558 --> 36:01.758
And I found their dog as well.

36:03.761 --> 36:04.894
I haven't touched anything.

36:06.731 --> 36:07.964
Okay. I'll be here.

36:25.049 --> 36:27.751
This is probably just another small
town nut looking for attention.

36:28.619 --> 36:30.887
The sooner these cases stop
getting media coverage,

36:31.555 --> 36:33.356
the sooner the crazies
will realize there's no point

36:33.358 --> 36:34.918
in trying to get this type
of attention.

36:35.726 --> 36:37.360
My money's on a lone gunman.

36:37.528 --> 36:38.862
I'm going with postal worker.

36:39.297 --> 36:40.977
Postal worker would have
shot the place up.

36:41.332 --> 36:42.699
Fuck, then maybe it actually
is Santa Claus.

36:42.701 --> 36:43.967
Is anyone betting on that?

36:45.770 --> 36:47.771
If it was Santa Claus, where did
he park his sleigh and reindeer?

36:47.773 --> 36:49.639
Maybe he's gone green
and drives a Prius?

36:49.974 --> 36:49.973
My wife drives one of those.

36:49.975 --> 36:53.810
Oh, yeah? Can she account
for her whereabouts recently?

36:53.812 --> 36:55.345
Yeah. I know where
yours has been.

36:55.746 --> 36:57.080
I'm getting coffee. Anyone?

36:57.082 --> 36:58.082
No, thanks.

37:08.392 --> 37:10.927
<i>Where the fire ripped through
the county snow plow yard</i>

37:10.929 --> 37:13.363
<i>destroying nearly all of the
county's plows...</i>

37:15.467 --> 37:16.533
Hello?

37:18.803 --> 37:20.370
Okay. Just stay there.

37:20.805 --> 37:22.939
Don't touch anything.
I'm gonna get the guys.

37:23.641 --> 37:24.641
Who are they?

37:28.979 --> 37:30.647
Show me.
Three of them?

37:33.818 --> 37:35.952
Right. We're on our way.

37:35.954 --> 37:36.986
We're gonna...

38:05.117 --> 38:07.016
Help me!

38:34.078 --> 38:36.179
Woodridge is a town
gripped with fear.

38:36.181 --> 38:38.948
With the latest massacre
of five FBI agents,

38:38.950 --> 38:40.950
there is now a feeling
amongst the residents

38:40.952 --> 38:43.820
<i>that the Sheriff Department is
overwhelmed by the situation,</i>

38:44.422 --> 38:47.023
<i>prompting many people to leave
this town during the holiday.</i>

38:47.658 --> 38:50.860
<i>After all, if the FBI
aren't safe, then who is?</i>

39:14.785 --> 39:16.019
Yes, I understand.

39:17.087 --> 39:18.455
Certainly, certainly.

39:20.691 --> 39:21.691
All right.

39:23.894 --> 39:26.029
Whoever they were,
they move quick.

39:27.164 --> 39:30.767
Agent Klein managed to get off one
shot, so he may have been hit.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.669
Well, we're checking the blood
now but, to be fair,

39:32.671 --> 39:35.505
there's a lot of it,
so it's gonna take a while.

39:35.940 --> 39:36.940
He's hit?

39:37.541 --> 39:38.975
Possibly.

39:39.477 --> 39:41.678
We've taken blood samples
from the deceased agents

39:41.680 --> 39:44.848
and we're cross-matching that against
all the blood we found on the scene.

39:44.850 --> 39:48.518
If there's anything extra, we know it's from
the perp and it's likely he's been hit.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.839
Okay, Fullard, let's get the bloodhounds
down here on the chance he's been hit.

39:52.523 --> 39:53.623
He's local.

39:53.625 --> 39:56.259
The feds have a net set up
around town, so he's here.

39:56.861 --> 39:58.495
Also, Jim, he, um...

39:59.997 --> 40:00.997
He removed their fingers.

40:01.866 --> 40:02.966
Fingers?

40:03.601 --> 40:05.168
Yep. From each
and everyone of them.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.237
- Even the bird.
- The bird?

40:07.838 --> 40:08.938
Bird. Yeah.

40:09.673 --> 40:10.940
The woman.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.243
Oh, right. I keep
forgetting you're a Brit.

40:13.611 --> 40:15.411
Let's let the fuckers bleed
to death for this.

40:16.847 --> 40:18.081
The same finger?

40:18.682 --> 40:21.050
Yeah. The, uh,
wedding band finger.

40:21.719 --> 40:23.519
We're gonna need some more FBI
guys down here.

40:24.088 --> 40:26.689
How is he picking them?
That's what I wanna know.

40:26.924 --> 40:29.726
There's no way he could know which
agents the FBI would send there.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.895
It's totally at random.
They could be from anywhere.

40:31.897 --> 40:33.730
No, it's the opportunity.

40:34.999 --> 40:36.232
Could've been these five.

40:36.234 --> 40:38.034
Could've been the goddamn
cleaning staff.

40:38.302 --> 40:39.769
But he is escalating
the numbers.

40:41.138 --> 40:42.238
Till he gets to how many?

40:43.274 --> 40:44.774
Maybe the number doesn't matter.

40:45.209 --> 40:46.809
Maybe they're getting close
to something.

40:48.212 --> 40:50.246
Fullard, photograph all
the notes these guys had.

40:50.248 --> 40:51.681
Maybe they were on to something.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.717
Yeah, well, the press
is gonna want a release.

40:54.852 --> 40:55.852
Yeah, yeah.

40:57.054 --> 40:58.955
But if they were wanted
by the cops,

40:58.957 --> 41:00.924
why risk everything
by coming back in here.

41:00.926 --> 41:02.859
No, we were all out there.
All of us.

41:02.861 --> 41:03.960
Hunting him down.

41:05.195 --> 41:06.729
Streets would've
been full of cops.

41:06.931 --> 41:08.665
But this place was quiet.

41:08.832 --> 41:09.933
Exactly.

41:11.235 --> 41:13.069
Anything else?

41:13.071 --> 41:15.431
I'll let you know when I get
the results of the blood tests.

41:17.007 --> 41:18.007
Happy hunting, Jim.

41:18.208 --> 41:19.208
Thanks.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.164
Yeah, there is actually
something else.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.349
Farmer Peterson's raging mad.

41:26.884 --> 41:27.984
About what?

41:28.252 --> 41:29.953
Says his geese were killed.

41:30.254 --> 41:33.189
Is this guy for real?
Take a fucking number.

41:34.925 --> 41:36.025
That's what I thought.

42:20.004 --> 42:22.105
So what are you gonna do
about my geese?

42:22.107 --> 42:23.640
I came out here, there they are.

42:23.642 --> 42:24.974
What are you gonna do about it?

42:24.976 --> 42:26.876
- Yeah. Mr. Peterson..
- That's your job.

42:26.878 --> 42:26.876
- Mr. Peterson, yeah... -what
are you gonna do about this?

42:26.878 --> 42:29.912
I know how you came out and all
your geese were found dead...

42:29.914 --> 42:31.814
No, not all my geese.
Are ya blind? Look.

42:31.816 --> 42:33.216
There's six of them dead. Six.

42:36.920 --> 42:38.154
Hey, did you say six?

43:41.485 --> 43:43.019
Nice try, Joe!

43:44.254 --> 43:45.388
Asshole.

44:24.862 --> 44:26.529
We're checking the CCTV
from the mall,

44:26.531 --> 44:28.831
but it looks like a lot
of cameras aren't working.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.268
There's a lot of places to hide
inside there when the place is open

44:32.270 --> 44:35.338
and a lot of exits
to slip out when it's closed.

44:35.539 --> 44:38.141
But I've got men questioning all
the staff who were left in there.

44:39.076 --> 44:40.076
Something will turn up.

44:40.811 --> 44:42.245
We'll find this guy.

44:42.247 --> 44:45.248
So, sheriff, what are you saying?
No one here's safe?

44:45.783 --> 44:48.951
Look, Lucy, panicking is
exactly what this guy wants.

44:49.353 --> 44:51.154
Well, who do the fingers
belong to?

44:51.156 --> 44:54.924
Uh, that information is not releasable
to the public at the moment.

44:55.092 --> 44:57.026
So you know?

44:57.028 --> 44:58.828
Whatever the reason, this guy's
reaching out to your daughter.

44:59.163 --> 45:01.798
Why would he?
What would he want with me?

45:02.166 --> 45:03.266
I don't know.

45:03.268 --> 45:05.334
The letter... do you
recognize the handwriting?

45:07.237 --> 45:08.337
Why would we know him?

45:08.906 --> 45:09.972
Lucy, I'm just asking.

45:10.340 --> 45:11.574
Anything you know could help.

45:11.576 --> 45:15.111
This is the first time he's
reached out to anyone by name.

45:17.881 --> 45:20.001
We're looking for a connection
and Jennifer may be it.

45:20.350 --> 45:22.251
Are you saying they're
targeting my family?

45:22.253 --> 45:24.220
Do you know of anyone with a
grudge against you?

45:24.222 --> 45:25.354
Particularly at Christmas?

45:25.356 --> 45:26.455
- No.
- No.

45:29.493 --> 45:31.828
I'm putting a unit on your house
and Jen till we catch him.

45:33.096 --> 45:35.198
- Who is he?
- We don't know.

45:36.066 --> 45:37.934
Do we know why he's doing this?

45:37.936 --> 45:39.402
Not yet, but we're
getting closer.

45:40.304 --> 45:42.238
He left Courtney alive.

45:42.606 --> 45:45.241
Have you seen anything strange
in the last few days?

45:45.475 --> 45:46.542
Phone calls?

45:46.544 --> 45:47.544
No.

45:49.546 --> 45:51.881
- What about the name?
- St. Nick?

45:52.082 --> 45:53.916
I assumed it was just a bad
Santa Claus joke.

45:54.051 --> 45:55.384
Joke?

45:55.619 --> 45:58.487
Yeah, sometimes
these killers like to...

45:59.423 --> 46:01.057
Like to hide out in the open.

46:01.059 --> 46:03.926
And it may be someone you know,
so don't go walking around alone

46:03.928 --> 46:05.628
until we nab this creep
and his accomplice.

46:07.264 --> 46:09.198
Jen, time's a factor here.

46:10.467 --> 46:12.134
Would you be willing
to do a polygraph test?

46:12.136 --> 46:14.570
That's enough!

46:14.572 --> 46:16.472
This may be the quickest way to find out if
she knows anything that she hasn't said yet.

46:16.474 --> 46:19.408
- I'm calling Rihann Frenchen.
- You can't, Lucy.

46:19.410 --> 46:21.210
I can call a lawyer
anytime I want.

46:21.212 --> 46:23.079
She's not even under arrest,
for Christ's sake.

46:23.081 --> 46:24.380
She's the victim here.

46:25.649 --> 46:27.016
You can't call Rihann Frenchen.

46:27.018 --> 46:28.084
And why the hell not?

46:30.354 --> 46:32.034
Because her whole family
has been murdered.

46:36.059 --> 46:37.393
We're leaving.

46:37.995 --> 46:38.661
- Come on, Jennifer.
- We're not finished...

46:38.663 --> 46:39.896
Come on!

46:48.171 --> 46:49.171
That went well.

46:49.406 --> 46:50.673
Yeah, keep an eye on them.

46:51.008 --> 46:52.508
Well, you don't think
they're suspect?

46:52.510 --> 46:54.110
No, but I got a connection now.

46:55.178 --> 46:57.013
Jen worked at the grotto
at the mall.

46:57.214 --> 46:58.281
First victim.

46:58.283 --> 47:00.416
No, she hasn't worked there
long enough.

47:00.418 --> 47:03.653
I've known Jen my whole life.
I don't think she's involved.

47:03.655 --> 47:05.254
Then maybe someone
connected with her.

47:07.457 --> 47:10.126
- Fullard?
- Uh, yeah.

47:10.294 --> 47:11.294
You with me here?

47:11.695 --> 47:13.195
Yeah. Sorry, I just, uh...

47:14.164 --> 47:15.404
I think it's a weak connection.

47:15.532 --> 47:16.999
Yeah but it's some connection.

47:18.335 --> 47:20.269
The second victim, Troy,
her ex-boyfriend.

47:21.571 --> 47:23.472
And now David Frenchen's
daughter.

47:23.974 --> 47:26.609
That's too much
coincidence for me.

47:26.611 --> 47:28.477
Add to that the fact her best
friend, Courtney,

47:28.479 --> 47:30.446
was the only girl left alive
at the bar attack.

47:31.348 --> 47:32.949
Um... did you get my message?

47:33.216 --> 47:34.717
Mm, no, I've been a little busy.

47:35.185 --> 47:36.218
Farmer Peterson called.

47:37.120 --> 47:39.221
- And?
- Geese have been poisoned.

47:39.723 --> 47:41.724
Is this like the time the
government salted his corn

47:41.726 --> 47:43.426
because he turned in
a UFO report?

47:43.428 --> 47:46.195
Jim. There were six of them.

47:46.997 --> 47:48.464
- Six?
- Yeah.

47:49.266 --> 47:50.366
Oh.

47:51.301 --> 47:53.169
- Good.
- How's that good?

47:54.071 --> 47:55.338
Could've been six dead bodies.

47:56.039 --> 47:57.039
Oh. True.

47:57.741 --> 47:59.475
- Did he see anything?
- No.

48:54.031 --> 48:55.064
Hello?

49:28.432 --> 49:29.432
Is someone there?

50:28.126 --> 50:29.792
<i>Front door, open.</i>

50:32.596 --> 50:33.696
Hello?

50:36.199 --> 50:37.299
Mom?

50:38.468 --> 50:39.568
Dad?

50:46.176 --> 50:47.810
Whoever's there better
show themselves.

50:49.646 --> 50:50.679
Courtney?

50:51.214 --> 50:52.214
Hey.

50:53.683 --> 50:55.317
Is it okay if I...

50:57.522 --> 51:00.289
I didn't wanna be alone.
Even in daylight.

51:00.524 --> 51:03.526
Yeah. It's okay.
You okay?

51:06.563 --> 51:07.563
Aren't you working today?

51:08.231 --> 51:09.431
Shopping mall's closed.

51:12.536 --> 51:13.636
What is it?

51:15.172 --> 51:16.172
Lisa.

51:17.374 --> 51:18.607
She didn't come home last night.

51:18.609 --> 51:19.642
Her parents are worried.

51:20.844 --> 51:21.944
Oh, god.

51:22.679 --> 51:24.280
- Did she call you?
- No.

51:26.783 --> 51:29.318
- We have to stick together.
- Together?

51:29.819 --> 51:31.921
Court, this psycho
is targeting everyone.

51:31.923 --> 51:35.424
Jen, I was with four friends
in a busy bar

51:35.426 --> 51:37.393
and that didn't stop anything.

51:37.395 --> 51:38.961
- We have to do something.
- What?

51:40.230 --> 51:41.764
Let's not wait to be a victim.

51:43.633 --> 51:45.901
Okay. But... but how?

51:45.903 --> 51:46.903
I don't know.

51:48.838 --> 51:49.838
You saw these guys.

51:51.408 --> 51:53.809
Maybe there's some connection
that we're not making

51:53.811 --> 51:55.711
that not even
the sheriff can see.

51:56.680 --> 51:59.882
Everyone so far has had a connection
with either me or my family.

52:00.817 --> 52:01.951
Well, what do you wanna do?

52:02.519 --> 52:03.619
I don't know.

52:05.522 --> 52:07.356
What do we know about Woodridge?

52:07.691 --> 52:10.326
Woodridge.
It's just a sleepy town.

52:10.328 --> 52:12.428
No, no, there's something,
I know there is.

52:14.364 --> 52:16.265
- We should look into it.
- Are you sure?

52:17.434 --> 52:19.735
I'm not gonna be a victim again.

52:29.813 --> 52:33.449
Look, I can assure you we are doing
everything we can to catch the perpetrator.

52:33.717 --> 52:36.552
While the manhunt and
investigation are still ongoing,

52:36.554 --> 52:39.288
I can't give you any information
that would jeopardize that.

52:39.290 --> 52:41.290
Deputy, what about the reports
of the missing girl?

52:41.292 --> 52:43.892
Could it possibly be the work
of this crazed killer?

52:44.294 --> 52:47.630
I can't comment on anything that
will compromise this investigation.

52:47.632 --> 52:50.666
And you guys aren't making it any better
by trying to create panic out there.

52:50.668 --> 52:53.402
Deputy, don't you think your inaction
may have cost them their lives?

52:53.637 --> 52:55.499
Look, me and the team are
working around the clock...

52:55.524 --> 52:56.672
didn't put a curfew in place.

52:56.674 --> 53:00.154
The mayor is saying it should have been
implemented the moment the first body was found.

53:01.311 --> 53:02.845
Did that come
out of the mayor's mouth?

53:02.847 --> 53:04.813
Sure did.
Care to comment?

53:05.015 --> 53:06.382
We'll see about that.

53:06.384 --> 53:08.350
Don't... sheriff?

53:20.597 --> 53:22.331
They're like jackals in there.

53:22.333 --> 53:24.466
You got some fucking nerve!

53:26.603 --> 53:28.671
You useless sack of shit!

53:28.673 --> 53:31.707
You've been nothing but a hindrance
in this entire investigation!

53:31.709 --> 53:36.745
If I catch this asshole, you best hope I don't
try to indict your ass for obstruction!

53:36.747 --> 53:38.080
- Jim!
- You wouldn't dare.

53:38.082 --> 53:39.982
- Try me.
- -Jim!

53:40.684 --> 53:42.484
I want you gone
by the end of the day!

53:42.752 --> 53:44.586
- Listen, mayor...
- Can it!

53:46.356 --> 53:48.724
Sheriff Mitchell
is relieved of his duties.

53:48.726 --> 53:50.459
You are temporary sheriff.

53:51.061 --> 53:53.062
And you have a drinking problem.

53:53.064 --> 53:54.997
And it just will not do anymore.

53:55.598 --> 53:58.867
I no longer have any faith in your
ability to perform your duties.

53:59.469 --> 54:00.602
Now, I'm outta here.

54:02.372 --> 54:04.640
I'm going to my son's
bachelor party

54:04.642 --> 54:07.976
and by the time I'm back,
I want you gone!

54:09.512 --> 54:10.612
Prick.

54:15.018 --> 54:16.018
- No handcuffs.
- Okay.

54:19.055 --> 54:20.489
Nice fucking shot.

54:26.596 --> 54:27.863
So...

54:30.033 --> 54:31.467
So what happened
to Peterson today?

54:32.535 --> 54:34.370
Ah, something was vandalized.

54:34.537 --> 54:35.904
Vandalized?

54:35.906 --> 54:38.741
Yeah, some milking machines
or some shit like that.

54:43.079 --> 54:44.580
Peterson's an asshole.

54:46.116 --> 54:47.750
He's almost as popular as I am.

54:49.920 --> 54:51.720
Come on, let's go get a coffee.

54:53.590 --> 54:54.590
Yeah.

54:57.395 --> 55:00.062
The sheriff's department has issued
an urgent plea to the public

55:00.064 --> 55:02.144
for help with their
investigations into the killings.

55:02.599 --> 55:04.466
If you have any information
you think may help,

55:04.468 --> 55:06.502
contact Woodridge pd
immediately.

56:00.857 --> 56:03.692
- What? -Lisa swan's parents
are freaking out, Jim.

56:03.960 --> 56:05.494
Did we get a unit
over to the pool?

56:05.496 --> 56:06.595
I went myself.

56:07.030 --> 56:08.464
Turns out she was
the last one...

56:10.900 --> 56:14.069
Turns out she was the last one there,
to do some extra swim practice,

56:14.071 --> 56:16.138
which isn't unusual,
but then nothing.

56:16.840 --> 56:17.906
CCTV?

56:17.908 --> 56:19.007
Disabled.

56:19.642 --> 56:20.742
Anything else?

56:21.978 --> 56:24.079
Yeah, we found swans
in the pool.

56:24.081 --> 56:26.148
- What?
- Little toy swans.

56:26.783 --> 56:28.016
Oh. Good.

56:28.685 --> 56:29.785
How's that good?

56:30.854 --> 56:31.894
Could've been bodies, Sam.

56:34.991 --> 56:37.125
Hey, what do you want me
to tell Lisa swan's parents?

56:39.596 --> 56:40.596
Where did this come from?

56:41.197 --> 56:42.197
Sam!

56:47.003 --> 56:48.103
What?

56:49.539 --> 56:51.379
Hey, does anybody else
know about this red box?

57:05.221 --> 57:06.955
Jim, we should get
bomb squad on this.

57:09.125 --> 57:10.259
It's not his style.

57:56.272 --> 57:57.573
What the hell is that?

59:08.211 --> 59:10.312
I told you I'd
keep the mall open.

59:10.314 --> 59:12.180
Hey, this is on me.

59:32.235 --> 59:36.972
So do you want me
to be naughty or nice?

59:37.974 --> 59:40.208
I've always liked naughty girls.

59:40.210 --> 59:42.711
What do you want for Christmas?

59:43.413 --> 59:46.281
I want you.
Unwrapped.

59:49.085 --> 59:52.454
And I wanna find these crazies
that are killing our taxpayers.

59:55.024 --> 59:57.426
Well, it's your lucky day.

59:57.428 --> 59:58.994
Why is that?

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.434
Because Santa Claus
is coming to town!

01:00:07.905 --> 01:00:11.139
Oh, this is not gonna be good
for the local economy.

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:19.381
Have fun, baby!

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:31.193
Merry Christmas, everyone!

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:41.436
What the fuck?

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:53.849
Dispatch. I need a unit right
away over to vixens strip club.

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:55.350
Multiple 1-8-7s.

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:57.953
It isn't... it's not live.

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:06.294
Ah, fuck.

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:09.865
What do we do now?

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:14.202
Call the coroner.

01:01:15.872 --> 01:01:17.339
Tell him to bring
a lot of body bags.

01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:23.812
Jen, I don't know.
We've been at it for hours

01:01:23.814 --> 01:01:25.280
and we still haven't
found anything.

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:31.019
- There's plenty of murders just...
- nothing this gruesome.

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:33.155
Shit.

01:01:33.157 --> 01:01:34.356
I don't know.

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:36.892
Have you tried searching
your parents?

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:38.460
My parents?

01:01:38.462 --> 01:01:40.262
Yeah, I mean,
they're whiter than white,

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:42.864
but we all know our parents
are just as fucked up as we are.

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:44.232
Hey, it's worth a shot.

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:55.877
Is that your mom?

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:58.013
Yeah.

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:01.249
Who's that guy?

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:09.224
<i>A state of emergency has now been
declared in northeast New York</i>

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:13.929
<i>as a record nine feet of snow has
effectively buried some towns and roads.</i>

01:02:13.931 --> 01:02:18.200
<i>St. Lawrence, Jefferson and Lewis counties
are still the most badly affected.</i>

01:02:18.202 --> 01:02:23.238
<i>With many towns in Lewis now
completely inaccessible, even by air.</i>

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.375
<i>This, of course, means that residents
in the community of Woodridge</i>

01:02:27.377 --> 01:02:29.211
<i>are effectively on their own</i>

01:02:29.213 --> 01:02:33.014
<i>trapped in extreme weather in this
town with the Christmas killer</i>

01:02:33.016 --> 01:02:38.119
<i>still at large after
slaughtering five FBI agents.</i>

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:41.156
<i>With the weather not likely
to improve for several days,</i>

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:44.392
<i>it's difficult not to feel sorry
for those who are trapped...</i>

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:47.362
There's a storm coming.

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:49.865
Ah, for Christ's sakes, Fullard.

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:52.334
No need to get so melodramatic
about the whole issue.

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:55.403
Um, I mean there's
an actual storm coming.

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:58.440
You know, bad weather, falling
trees, blizzards, et cetera?

01:02:58.641 --> 01:03:00.475
I think that's really gonna
delay the new feds.

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:02.010
Great.

01:03:02.012 --> 01:03:04.880
They get anything back from the
lab on the DNA for that apple?

01:03:04.882 --> 01:03:08.450
Pear? No, we didn't really
pull anything off the swab.

01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:10.771
Didn't get any fingerprints
that were any good either.

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:14.256
Say again?

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:16.258
I mean, like,
the swab wasn't very good.

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:18.393
And the fingerprints...

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:20.362
We don't have the kind of
database to do...

01:03:20.364 --> 01:03:22.063
No, no, no, no.
Not that part.

01:03:23.499 --> 01:03:24.666
Did you say pear?

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.202
- Yeah.
- I thought it was an apple.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:30.205
Well, so did I, but it's a pear.

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:33.008
Why?

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.576
Pear?

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:38.146
Pear... pear tree.

01:03:38.547 --> 01:03:42.484
- Uh... what was his name?
- Who?

01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:46.154
The mall Santa... the guy...
The Santa at the mall.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:48.023
- Come on, come on.
- I got it. Got it here.

01:03:48.624 --> 01:03:50.025
- Uh...
- Come on.

01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:52.360
- James.
- James? James what?

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:53.461
- Partridge.
- Ja...

01:03:57.633 --> 01:04:00.669
Wake everybody up.
I've got it.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.270
Got what?

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:05.407
How the son of a bitch
is targeting people.

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:23.358
Sheriff, they're, uh, coming in
but the storm...

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.060
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:25.062 --> 01:04:27.329
We've been looking
at this all wrong.

01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:30.699
We've been expecting the number
of murders to match the day,

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:33.601
with a link to Jennifer
and her family.

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.271
But there's more to it
than that.

01:04:36.273 --> 01:04:38.073
Sheriff, what are you
talking about?

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:40.356
"On the first day of Christmas,
my true love gave to me...

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:44.245
- A partridge in a pear tree."
- Oh shit.

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:47.115
"On the second day of Christmas,
my true love gave to me,

01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:49.751
two turtle doves."
Turtle dove point.

01:04:51.188 --> 01:04:53.588
"Three French hens"...
The Frenchens.

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:54.656
Three of them.

01:04:54.658 --> 01:04:56.591
What is it?

01:04:56.593 --> 01:04:58.727
Uh, the song. I can't
remember the... the, uh...

01:04:58.729 --> 01:05:01.663
- The lines...
- "Four calling birds."

01:05:01.665 --> 01:05:03.164
"Four calling birds."

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:06.134
<i>"Birds," the British term
for girls.</i>

01:05:06.136 --> 01:05:07.535
<i>Four birds. Four women.</i>

01:05:07.537 --> 01:05:09.537
Which is why they left
Courtney alive.

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:13.108
Oh fuck!

01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:15.477
"Five golden rings."

01:05:17.279 --> 01:05:18.713
The FBI guys.

01:05:18.715 --> 01:05:21.149
- Peterson's geese!
- "Six geese a-laying."

01:05:25.187 --> 01:05:27.188
"Seven swans a-swimming."

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:31.259
Then something doesn't match up
here, 'cause last I checked,

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:33.228
we didn't have eight
milk maids killed.

01:05:33.662 --> 01:05:36.297
No, I'm wrong.
Peterson's farm.

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:40.335
There's a spot at the back.
Eight milk maid machines.

01:05:40.337 --> 01:05:41.503
Completely destroyed.

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:43.605
Umm... "Nine ladies dancing!"

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.573
<i>The strippers at the ViXen club.</i>

01:05:45.575 --> 01:05:47.642
Uh... "Ten lords a leaping."

01:05:47.644 --> 01:05:50.278
The mayor's son's bachelor party.
Ten of them dead.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.414
This is good, good, good. Umm...

01:05:52.416 --> 01:05:54.215
It's not over yet though, Jim.

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:57.218
There's twelve days
of Christmas.

01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:58.787
There's still two lines left
in that song.

01:05:58.789 --> 01:06:00.755
Yeah, I know.
But he's local.

01:06:00.757 --> 01:06:02.824
- He has to be.
- Yeah but how can you be sure?

01:06:03.325 --> 01:06:05.060
Peterson's geese.

01:06:05.327 --> 01:06:07.362
Uh... swans in a swimming pool,

01:06:07.364 --> 01:06:11.733
five FBI agents show up for
their fingers to be hacked off.

01:06:13.235 --> 01:06:14.836
Yeah. He's local.

01:06:15.704 --> 01:06:18.139
Or he knows somebody who is.

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:20.141
You have to have access
to Peterson's farm

01:06:20.509 --> 01:06:22.110
to get in twice
without being spotted.

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:26.913
Which is right next
to Jen's old house.

01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:30.351
- The swimming pool is... -I'll be right
back, sheriff. I gotta check something.

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:32.520
Yeah, yeah.
The swimming pool...

01:06:32.522 --> 01:06:34.622
Swimming pool... swimming pool.

01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:37.859
Kathy!

01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:41.262
Let's get some
Christmas music in here.

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:43.164
Did he just say Christmas music?

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:46.468
<i>Front door, open.</i>

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:53.141
Hey! Have you eaten yet?

01:06:58.814 --> 01:06:59.814
Jen?

01:07:01.584 --> 01:07:03.451
Who's sergeant Nicholas Conway?

01:07:08.757 --> 01:07:09.757
Oh, god.

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:17.665
Mom?

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:21.836
You know that frank and I
love you very much.

01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:24.706
Mom, I need to know.
What is this?

01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:27.542
When I was younger...

01:07:29.612 --> 01:07:32.647
Before I met your... frank...

01:07:37.419 --> 01:07:38.419
I was married.

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:41.456
To who?

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:43.391
Nick Conway.

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:48.396
He was a very popular guy and...
He was in the British military.

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:50.465
Handsome.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:51.900
He, um...

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:54.802
He came back from the Gulf war.

01:07:57.173 --> 01:07:59.941
Kosovo, places I've never
even heard of and, uh...

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:03.511
He changed, Jen. He...

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.749
He became... mean.

01:08:08.317 --> 01:08:09.317
Nasty.

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:11.252
I was terrified.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:12.921
I...

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:15.723
I tried to make
a happy life with him.

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:18.725
He used to say he was like
a bullet in a chamber

01:08:18.728 --> 01:08:20.361
and the trigger had been pulled.

01:08:21.596 --> 01:08:22.796
What did he do?

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.368
On Christmas Eve...

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:29.270
He, um...

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:32.974
He attacked me.

01:08:34.643 --> 01:08:36.444
- Tried to murder me.
- God.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.580
- He came at me with a knife.
- Jesus!

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:40.415
The police...

01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:43.218
They arrested him.

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.986
I-I had to leave him.

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:46.787
Mom?

01:08:47.488 --> 01:08:48.488
I'm sorry.

01:08:51.894 --> 01:08:52.894
I divorced him.

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:58.566
And Mrs. Frenchen?
She represented you.

01:09:00.368 --> 01:09:02.670
That's why you always refer
to her as your lawyer

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.538
even though she only did
divorce cases?

01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:05.541
That's right.

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:08.948
And this happened
at Christmas, didn't it?

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:12.747
Served divorce papers
on Christmas day.

01:09:15.684 --> 01:09:17.585
He said that I had
broken up the family.

01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:18.920
Christ!

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:21.488
He went off the deep end.

01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:24.792
They, uh, took him to a mental
institution to get help.

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:26.560
And he escaped?

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:28.729
No. That's just it.

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:32.567
The mental institution burned
down three years ago.

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:34.002
Nick Conway died.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:38.006
- At least I...
- You thought he died?

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:41.609
They found all of his teeth
in the ashes.

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:44.444
I mean, they wrote a death
certificate

01:09:44.447 --> 01:09:47.982
based on all of his teeth
and a burnt corpse.

01:09:47.984 --> 01:09:49.951
Well, clearly,
he didn't die, mom.

01:09:50.486 --> 01:09:51.586
He's out!

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:53.621
He's out.

01:09:56.392 --> 01:09:57.392
Wait...

01:09:58.527 --> 01:09:59.727
That's not it, is it?

01:10:01.463 --> 01:10:03.965
I'm sorry, Jen.
I should've told you the truth.

01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:05.566
What truth?

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:08.369
Wait...

01:10:09.571 --> 01:10:11.839
You said he said you'd
broken up the family.

01:10:12.641 --> 01:10:14.676
But if it were just
the two of you,

01:10:14.678 --> 01:10:16.744
that's not a family,
that's a marriage.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.080
God.

01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:23.551
When I left him...

01:10:24.653 --> 01:10:26.954
- I was pregnant.
- No.

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:29.090
- Nick Conway is...
- No!

01:10:29.092 --> 01:10:31.793
I'm sorry, Jen.
I should've told you sooner.

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:35.763
So my biological father
is a raving lunatic?!

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:38.733
Jen, you're not your father's daughter!
You're nothing like him!

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:40.902
He's killing people, mom,
so what does he want?!

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:44.811
If he wants the same thing
as when he was committed,

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:47.475
he wants us
to be a family again.

01:10:50.979 --> 01:10:52.939
Well, clearly we're not that
dissimilar after all.

01:11:12.401 --> 01:11:13.901
<i>Front door, open.</i>

01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:22.610
Why didn't you say anything?

01:11:22.978 --> 01:11:25.146
You know why.
He's dead.

01:11:26.648 --> 01:11:27.982
Then there's no harm
in telling anyone,

01:11:27.984 --> 01:11:29.617
if that's what you believe.

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:32.787
He's dead.
They found all his teeth.

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:34.522
Was it conclusive?

01:11:34.524 --> 01:11:39.127
They found enough teeth and blood for the
coroner to say his death was very probable.

01:11:39.129 --> 01:11:40.461
Probable.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.130
Lucy, they never found a body.

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:46.701
Sam, please.

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:49.703
Do you think I wanted to believe
this shit is happening?

01:11:50.406 --> 01:11:52.507
Last time I saw this guy
in action he killed...

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:57.678
He killed my best friend
in cold blood for no reason.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:58.780
I know.

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:02.550
We just put all this stuff
behind us.

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:03.751
Does frank know?

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.687
- What would I tell him?
- The truth, Lucy.

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.691
It's not your fault
this guy lost his mind.

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:12.093
And what would I tell Jen?

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:14.729
That her father's a psychopath?

01:12:14.731 --> 01:12:16.097
At least she'd be prepared.

01:12:16.099 --> 01:12:16.998
For this?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.533
It could be him.

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:21.035
He's dead.

01:12:21.037 --> 01:12:24.705
If that's what you believe,
then why not tell the sheriff?

01:12:25.574 --> 01:12:26.674
Because...

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:29.977
I'm not so sure I believe that.

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:33.147
- You should tell the sheriff.
- No!

01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:35.183
- Why?
- Think of Jennifer.

01:12:35.185 --> 01:12:37.018
I am thinking of Jennifer!

01:12:41.123 --> 01:12:42.557
If it is Nick Conway...

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.961
Then we know exactly what direction
that attack is gonna come from

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:49.564
and that's more than we've
got to go on right now.

01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:53.234
There was a girl with him,
too, right?

01:12:53.236 --> 01:12:54.236
Yeah.

01:12:56.738 --> 01:12:58.139
But we don't know
who she is yet.

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:00.575
I might.

01:13:02.077 --> 01:13:03.077
What?

01:13:04.646 --> 01:13:05.746
How?

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:07.482
If it is him...

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:11.118
Then the girl could be
the only other body

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.154
that was unaccounted for
in the wreckage.

01:13:13.755 --> 01:13:14.989
Who is she?

01:13:14.991 --> 01:13:17.058
Criminally insane and guilty

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:19.494
- of three counts of murder.
- Jesus, Lucy.

01:13:21.697 --> 01:13:22.697
All right.

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:25.946
I have to go
check something out.

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:31.239
There's a patrol car outside.

01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:34.021
Got nothing to worry about.

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:36.711
Sam, I've messed it all up.

01:13:36.879 --> 01:13:37.879
Not yet.

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:41.048
We still got time
to get through this.

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:43.117
Wait here.
Wait by the phone.

01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:08.309
<i>The change in the storm front
over northeast New York</i>

01:14:08.311 --> 01:14:12.580
<i>means the roads could be
accessible in the next 24 hours,</i>

01:14:12.582 --> 01:14:14.315
<i>but after yet another massacre,</i>

01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:17.051
<i>one has to wonder
for the residents of Woodridge,</i>

01:14:17.053 --> 01:14:20.021
<i>will 24 hours be too late?</i>

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:38.673
<i>Woodridge police department.</i>

01:14:38.675 --> 01:14:39.915
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:44.812
Hi, sheriff.

01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:48.182
It's Lucy, uh, Jen's mom.

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:51.152
Listen.

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:53.287
I think I know who's been
doing all of this.

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:58.292
I think it's Jen's
biological father.

01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:03.264
And she didn't know and
she's out there all alone...

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:18.145
Frank?

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:20.381
The phone's gone dead.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.922
The storm probably took out
the local cell phone tower.

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:36.130
<i>Front door, open.</i>

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:37.932
Oh, god.

01:15:38.266 --> 01:15:39.266
Jen?

01:15:50.946 --> 01:15:52.246
Hello?

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:06.093
Frank?!

01:16:06.095 --> 01:16:08.329
- <i>Front door, open.</i>

01:16:15.804 --> 01:16:16.804
Frank?!

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:02.249
Merry Christmas, sweetheart!

01:17:03.386 --> 01:17:05.753
- Frank!
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:17:05.755 --> 01:17:07.855
Frank!
Oh, no, no, no.

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:10.891
Frank isn't joining us
for the rest of his life.

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:12.827
You need a new husband!

01:17:12.829 --> 01:17:14.729
Please, Nick.

01:17:14.731 --> 01:17:17.431
Oh, I'm just kidding!

01:17:17.433 --> 01:17:18.899
I'm not gonna hurt you,
sweetheart.

01:17:18.901 --> 01:17:21.168
You're the mother of my child!

01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:22.970
What do you want?

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:26.040
Well, just to get the family
back together over the holidays!

01:17:27.375 --> 01:17:29.410
Hey! There she is!

01:17:45.026 --> 01:17:46.794
All we're missing is mistletoe!

01:17:47.964 --> 01:17:50.131
You...

01:17:51.032 --> 01:17:53.868
Are gonna love what
I got you for Christmas.

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:55.336
Is it a bear trap?

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:57.371
Well, why don't we wait and see?

01:17:57.373 --> 01:18:00.508
Let's get frank down here
and get this party started!

01:18:22.831 --> 01:18:23.831
Still nothing?

01:18:24.132 --> 01:18:25.132
No.

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:30.037
Let's just try and
enjoy this night, okay?

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:32.306
Yeah, it's okay, Jen.
Nothing to worry about.

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:42.817
<i>Dispatch to 3-9-2.
Please check in.</i>

01:18:44.319 --> 01:18:46.921
3-9-2,<i> this is dispatch.</i>
<i>Check in, please.</i>

01:18:48.423 --> 01:18:49.557
<i>3-9-2, come in.</i>

01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:52.326
<i>Bobby, you there?</i>

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:13.948
Sheriff, pipers piping.

01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:17.218
<i>- Dispatch to 2-7-4.</i>
- Copy that.

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:21.155
<i>2-7-4, please proceed to mount
drive and check on officer Davies.</i>

01:19:21.157 --> 01:19:23.123
<i>We just got a message
from the house,</i>

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:25.426
<i>but the phone line is now dead
and Davies isn't checking in.</i>

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:26.493
Understood.

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:33.467
<i>"'Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house.</i>

01:19:34.035 --> 01:19:37.238
<i>Not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.</i>

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:40.374
<i>The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,</i>

01:19:40.376 --> 01:19:43.878
<i>in the hopes that Saint
Nicholas would soon be there.</i>

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:47.414
<i>The children were nestled,
all snug in their beds,</i>

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:51.285
<i>while visions of sugar plums
danced in their heads."</i>

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.622
Ten, nine, eight...

01:20:00.228 --> 01:20:03.130
<i>"And mamma in her
handkerchief and I in my cap,</i>

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:06.634
<i>had just settled our brains
for a long winter's nap."</i>

01:20:06.636 --> 01:20:08.602
Seven, six...

01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:11.438
<i>"When out on the lawn
there rose such a clatter,</i>

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.141
<i>I sprang from the bed
to see what was the matter.</i>

01:20:15.143 --> 01:20:17.111
<i>Away to the window I flew
like a flash,</i>

01:20:17.113 --> 01:20:20.347
<i>tore open the shutters
and threw out the sash.</i>

01:20:20.349 --> 01:20:22.917
<i>The moon on the breast
of the new fallen snow,</i>

01:20:22.919 --> 01:20:25.653
<i>gave the luster of mid-day
to the objects below.</i>

01:20:26.454 --> 01:20:29.356
<i>When what to my wandering eye
should appear,</i>

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:32.626
<i>but a miniature sleigh
and eight tiny reindeer."</i>

01:20:32.628 --> 01:20:34.561
<i>Five, four...</i>

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:38.399
<i>"With a little old driver,
so lively and quick,</i>

01:20:38.401 --> 01:20:41.435
<i>I knew in a moment,
it must be Saint Nick.</i>

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:45.673
<i>He spoke not a word,
but went straight to his work</i>

01:20:46.374 --> 01:20:49.276
<i>and filled all the stockings
and then turned with a jerk.</i>

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:52.947
<i>And laying his finger
aside of his nose,</i>

01:20:52.949 --> 01:20:55.182
<i>and giving a nod,
up the chimney he rose."</i>

01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:57.017
<i>Three, two...</i>

01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:59.720
<i>"He sprung to his sleigh
and to his team gave a whistle,</i>

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:02.957
<i>and away they all flew,
like the down of a thistle.</i>

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:07.594
<i>But I heard him exclaim
as he drove out of sight,</i>

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:10.698
<i>'happy Christmas to all,</i>

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:13.734
<i>and to all,
a bloody good night!'"</i>

01:21:13.736 --> 01:21:16.637
- one! Merry Christmas!

01:21:28.316 --> 01:21:29.316
Mom?

01:21:30.318 --> 01:21:31.485
Lisa?

01:21:31.487 --> 01:21:33.020
Merry Christmas, everyone!

01:21:34.289 --> 01:21:36.156
Now... who's been naughty?

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:40.027
Holy shit!

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:46.600
Joe!

01:21:46.602 --> 01:21:47.735
Let's go! Let's go!

01:22:03.385 --> 01:22:06.487
- Lucy?
- She's not here.

01:22:06.489 --> 01:22:07.489
Why would he take her?

01:22:09.557 --> 01:22:10.758
Eleventh day.

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:12.626
This is the twelfth.

01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:16.463
"Twelve drummers drumming."

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:19.666
"Twelve drummers... drumming."

01:22:31.746 --> 01:22:32.746
Shit!

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:37.484
- They killed Joe.
- We need to move.

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:40.120
We're not leaving
without mom and Lisa.

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:41.655
No, we're all
getting outta here.

01:22:41.657 --> 01:22:43.557
- David.
- I'm not leaving you!

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:46.199
They can't take the person
I love away from me.

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:47.828
I'm gonna try to
draw them outside.

01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:49.329
Courtney, no.

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:52.299
We can't be victims again, Jen.

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:56.236
Hey! Jingle whore!

01:22:56.704 --> 01:22:59.306
You want some?
Well, come get some!

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:00.340
I'm coming too!

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:05.245
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:23:15.558 --> 01:23:17.825
Come on!
We have to go! Please!

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.163
Come on, get up!

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:26.266
I can't move!

01:23:26.268 --> 01:23:27.468
Come on! We need to get out...

01:23:45.187 --> 01:23:46.720
Fuck you! Go to hell!

01:23:48.624 --> 01:23:52.626
I like a girl with some spunk!

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:55.329
- No! No! No!
- Stop!

01:23:59.467 --> 01:24:00.634
There she is.

01:24:00.636 --> 01:24:01.768
Let them go.

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:03.737
- Go!
- Hey! Get away from her...

01:24:03.739 --> 01:24:04.739
Stop!

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:06.573
Please.

01:24:06.908 --> 01:24:08.142
No one else.

01:24:08.144 --> 01:24:12.713
What father could ignore the pleas
of his beautiful baby girl?

01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:15.215
If you let them go,
you can take me.

01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:16.550
Ha!

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:19.186
There's the Christmas spirit
I been looking for.

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:20.687
Please.

01:24:21.789 --> 01:24:22.789
Look at you.

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:24.758
All grown up.

01:24:25.693 --> 01:24:27.227
My beautiful baby girl.

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:30.430
You turned into a full-blown
true blue hero.

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:32.766
I'm not a hero.

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:34.468
Neither am I.

01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:37.471
But that's what they call you
when you kill for uncle Sam.

01:24:37.473 --> 01:24:40.941
Oh, don't worry, I didn't kill
anybody that cared about Christmas,

01:24:40.943 --> 01:24:42.709
and that applies
to the people here, too.

01:24:42.711 --> 01:24:46.280
But you... you could be
the real deal.

01:24:46.282 --> 01:24:48.682
A true hero
and not even know it.

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:51.852
I could never kill anyone.

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:55.489
We'll see.

01:24:57.292 --> 01:24:59.226
Because you and I
are gonna play a game.

01:25:00.628 --> 01:25:02.868
And then we'll see how far
the apple falls from the tree.

01:25:06.534 --> 01:25:07.634
You like it?

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:10.737
It's an IED.

01:25:10.739 --> 01:25:16.343
Absolutely amazing what you can buy
at a hardware store these days. Hmm?

01:25:16.345 --> 01:25:17.544
Why are you doing this?

01:25:19.981 --> 01:25:20.981
For your protection.

01:25:23.284 --> 01:25:24.418
From what?

01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:27.254
From people that don't
believe in anything.

01:25:27.555 --> 01:25:29.256
You could do better
than that, Jennifer.

01:25:29.258 --> 01:25:30.824
You gotta fight
for what's right!

01:25:30.826 --> 01:25:32.259
No, you know what
you have to do?

01:25:32.261 --> 01:25:33.894
You've got to kill
for what's right.

01:25:34.362 --> 01:25:35.495
And I know you can.

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:37.517
You only let the light
to show the way.

01:25:37.865 --> 01:25:39.533
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:25:40.401 --> 01:25:41.401
Because you and I...

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:43.270
We're the same.

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:45.906
You and me, kiddo.

01:25:47.575 --> 01:25:49.343
And I got you a brand new mommy.

01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:51.445
You're gonna love her.

01:26:02.024 --> 01:26:03.657
Come on, get some!

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:04.758
Yummy.

01:26:06.794 --> 01:26:08.862
I'm not gonna love her or you.

01:26:10.465 --> 01:26:11.865
And don't pretend you love me,

01:26:11.867 --> 01:26:14.401
because you would never
kill my friend if you did.

01:26:14.403 --> 01:26:16.036
How dare you!

01:26:16.038 --> 01:26:18.438
Love never dies, Jennifer.

01:26:19.307 --> 01:26:21.842
They're gonna catch you
and they're gonna kill you.

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:25.679
No. No, baby.

01:26:27.615 --> 01:26:28.615
No, they're not.

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:30.417
But you know what?

01:26:30.652 --> 01:26:32.419
If you want me dead...

01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:34.588
Here, all you have to do is
do it yourself.

01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:36.490
- What?
- There you go.

01:26:36.492 --> 01:26:37.658
There you go, baby.

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:39.059
The power's in your hands.

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:41.461
Just pull the trigger.
Go for it.

01:26:41.463 --> 01:26:43.030
- Pull the trigger.

01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:45.599
I can't kill anyone.

01:26:49.604 --> 01:26:51.004
Oh. Maybe you have to.

01:26:51.006 --> 01:26:53.874
Cause if you don't,
I might pull this trigger.

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:56.136
And you wanna guess
what that does?

01:26:57.011 --> 01:26:58.478
Hmm?

01:26:58.480 --> 01:26:59.960
Now, be a good girl
and put the gun up

01:27:00.648 --> 01:27:02.449
or I might blow mom away.

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:07.821
Attagirl.
Raise it up.

01:27:08.923 --> 01:27:11.591
Come on. Come on.

01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:12.659
That's it.

01:27:12.661 --> 01:27:15.595
Come on. Come on.

01:27:16.999 --> 01:27:18.732
That's it. Go!

01:27:18.734 --> 01:27:19.734
Come on!

01:27:21.469 --> 01:27:22.736
Come on baby girl.
That's it.

01:27:22.738 --> 01:27:24.604
Come on. Do it!

01:27:29.677 --> 01:27:33.046
You see?

01:27:34.415 --> 01:27:35.895
You and I are not
all that dissimilar.

01:27:37.118 --> 01:27:38.819
You only lack the motivation.

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:41.955
Get away from her.

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:43.657
You're insane!

01:27:44.926 --> 01:27:46.026
Call me dad.

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:47.828
Hey, look.

01:27:48.496 --> 01:27:50.397
Whoa. Hold it tight.

01:27:50.399 --> 01:27:52.099
Hold it tight.
There we go.

01:27:53.535 --> 01:27:55.502
Or you'll kill all of us.

01:28:02.643 --> 01:28:03.844
Do you love her?

01:28:04.979 --> 01:28:05.979
What?

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:11.118
It's Christmas, David!

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:17.858
Do... you... love her?

01:28:18.659 --> 01:28:19.760
Yeah.

01:28:20.495 --> 01:28:21.495
Yeah, I do.

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:24.831
That's nice, isn't it?

01:28:24.833 --> 01:28:29.002
Every father wants to hear that
his little baby girl is loved.

01:28:30.538 --> 01:28:31.538
They really do.

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:35.575
You know what the only problem
with it all is?

01:28:36.911 --> 01:28:39.111
He doesn't ever really want
to hear it from another guy.

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:42.149
Oh, well.

01:28:55.097 --> 01:28:56.730
Don't you fucking move!

01:29:00.436 --> 01:29:03.069
- Where is he?
- Fuck you!

01:29:04.872 --> 01:29:07.541
- Call for backup! -Sheriff,
we don't have time for that.

01:29:07.543 --> 01:29:09.009
We don't have time to wait.

01:29:09.011 --> 01:29:10.644
Call it in!

01:29:10.646 --> 01:29:12.212
We've got one suspect
in custody.

01:29:12.214 --> 01:29:15.115
I need backup and EMR right now
immediately down to Phil's bar.

01:29:18.853 --> 01:29:20.987
We have company, Jennifer.

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:24.958
Okay, listen, baby.

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.927
I'm gonna make things real
interesting, 'cause time is short.

01:29:26.929 --> 01:29:30.530
In ten seconds, both of those
IED vests are gonna explode.

01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:32.966
But, you can pick
who lives and who dies.

01:29:36.471 --> 01:29:38.472
- Eight seconds.
- I can't.

01:29:38.474 --> 01:29:40.474
Of course you can. If you
do nothing, both will die.

01:29:40.476 --> 01:29:41.675
Where's the sense in that?

01:29:41.677 --> 01:29:43.777
- No!
- Come on.

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:47.614
Four, three, two...

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:53.687
You see?

01:29:53.689 --> 01:29:55.155
There you are.

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:59.092
Yes. You can kill.

01:30:00.828 --> 01:30:02.062
Attagirl.

01:30:02.064 --> 01:30:03.697
You can kill.

01:30:04.832 --> 01:30:06.800
You just need
the right motivation.

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:09.536
When someone takes something
from you that you love,

01:30:10.838 --> 01:30:12.072
you'll kill to protect it.

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:15.809
Just. Like. Me.

01:30:22.016 --> 01:30:23.116
You're safe now, Jennifer.

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:24.918
We got it from here.

01:30:26.854 --> 01:30:29.289
Don't you listen to him.
You're not safe.

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:32.759
He's just gonna lock me up
and I'll escape

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:35.562
and then I'll find you...
Both of you!

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:39.199
So what's my baby girl gonna do?

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:45.805
Close your eyes.

01:30:45.807 --> 01:30:46.873
No!

01:30:55.182 --> 01:30:56.182
It was a stun grenade.

01:30:57.885 --> 01:30:58.885
You're safe. You're safe.

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:01.555
He's gone.

01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:16.870
<i>The horrific Christmas killings that
rocked the sleepy town of Woodridge</i>

01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:19.606
came to a terrifying
conclusion this morning,

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:23.076
with an early hours massacre
at an event in Phil's bar,

01:31:23.078 --> 01:31:25.912
<i>the main drinking establishment
in this now infamous town.</i>

01:31:26.647 --> 01:31:29.883
A series of bizarre murders
and vandalism that crescendoed

01:31:29.885 --> 01:31:33.053
over the last 12 days finally
climaxed with a deadly assault

01:31:33.055 --> 01:31:35.188
on the patrons of a music event.

01:31:36.123 --> 01:31:40.694
Details are still emerging, but we do know
that so many people were killed and injured,

01:31:40.696 --> 01:31:44.364
that extra emergency personnel had to be
brought in from neighboring counties,

01:31:44.366 --> 01:31:48.602
<i>with victims still being taken
to hospital well into daylight.</i>

01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:52.272
One suspect is believed to be in
police custody while the other,

01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:55.208
army veteran, Nick Conway,
is still at large.

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:58.812
Local police chief, sheriff
Mitchell, issued a warning

01:31:58.814 --> 01:32:00.647
<i>to the public not
to approach Conway,</i>

01:32:00.649 --> 01:32:02.849
<i>but to instead call 911
immediately,</i>

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:05.118
<i>as he's still considered
extremely dangerous.</i>

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:08.622
It's doubtful that the residents
of this small town

01:32:08.624 --> 01:32:10.357
will be able
to forget what happened

01:32:10.992 --> 01:32:13.059
over these terrifying
12 days of Christmas.

01:32:29.844 --> 01:32:31.778
How about you unlock this door?

01:32:33.114 --> 01:32:36.216
And we can have the most
wonderful time of the year.

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:40.053
You're never getting
out of this jail cell.

01:32:41.155 --> 01:32:42.255
Hmm.

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:46.259
You're playing hard to get.

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:51.264
You like the anticipation...

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:55.101
Before you get the presents.

01:32:55.803 --> 01:32:56.803
Right?

01:33:06.714 --> 01:33:08.748
How long do you think
it's gonna be

01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:12.285
before daddy comes to get me?

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.455
- Never.
- Hmm.

01:33:15.457 --> 01:33:18.324
See, we hit him, and he's hurt.

01:33:19.326 --> 01:33:22.362
And sooner or later,
he's gotta go get help

01:33:22.364 --> 01:33:24.330
and when he does
he's gonna slip up.

01:33:25.332 --> 01:33:27.100
And I'm gonna be there
to nail him.

01:33:29.737 --> 01:33:31.371
The only place that you two are
going...

01:33:32.873 --> 01:33:33.873
Is to the chair.

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:40.246
You're gonna pay
for everything you did.

01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:57.797
You'd better watch out.
