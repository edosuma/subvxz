00:06.400 --> 00:08.960
- [yelp]
- What was that?

00:08.960 --> 00:12.240
- What?
- I thought I heard something,

00:12.240 --> 00:17.320
- like an animal or something.
-[squawking]

00:17.320 --> 00:20.440
[clucking]

00:20.440 --> 00:23.720
- Nobody here but us chickens.
- Very funny.

00:23.720 --> 00:26.080
Here, let me do it.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.240
I can do it.
Give me the matches.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.760
- Where's Kristen?
- She'll be here.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.680
Don't get your shorts in a knot.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.080
Yeah, after the work is all done.

00:35.080 --> 00:37.480
She wouldn't want to break
her fingernails.

00:37.480 --> 00:38.960
Ouch!

00:38.960 --> 00:42.440
We're going to have to
make a rule about latecomers.

00:42.440 --> 00:43.160
[howl]

00:44.600 --> 00:47.840
- What was that?
- Sounded like a hound dog.

00:47.840 --> 00:51.320
- Maybe it was Kristen.
- She's no dog.

00:51.320 --> 00:52.040

[barking]

01:05.720 --> 01:07.640
Kristen.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.960
Sorry I'm late.
I had to pick up Elvis.

01:09.960 --> 01:13.120
- And who's Elvis?
- He ain't nothing but a hound dog.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.240
My dad says Elvis the King.

01:15.240 --> 01:17.440
Kristen, are you going
to tell us a story,

01:17.440 --> 01:20.480
or are you just going to sit there
scaring us with Elvis?

01:20.480 --> 01:23.520
I have a tale that will have you
shaking in your little booties.

01:23.520 --> 01:24.520
Ooh!

01:27.080 --> 01:30.200
Elvis is here for the sound effects.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.600
I'll need some help
with the dust, Dave.

01:33.600 --> 01:38.080
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

01:38.080 --> 01:40.920
I call this story...

01:56.040 --> 01:58.000
[Kristen]
On rainy days,

01:58.000 --> 02:01.480
Pam like to rummage around
in her musty old attic.

02:01.480 --> 02:04.440
Her mother never threw
anything away.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.240
There was stuff
from Pam's grandparents,

02:10.240 --> 02:14.880
from relatives and ancestors
who'd been dead for years.

02:14.880 --> 02:19.600
One summer, Pam's Cousin Amy
was visiting from the city.

02:23.720 --> 02:26.040
Amy, come here.

02:26.040 --> 02:29.120
Look at this.
Isn't this great?

02:29.120 --> 02:32.160
Grandpa wore this at his wedding.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.640
Just think--
My mother and your father

02:35.640 --> 02:38.640
were just a twinkle in his eye.

02:38.640 --> 02:43.160
- But I guess Aunt Dora came first.
- [thump]

02:43.160 --> 02:44.160
Amy?

02:48.520 --> 02:50.720
Come here. Look at this.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.040
Amy, where are you?

02:57.320 --> 02:58.320
Amy?

03:03.760 --> 03:05.840
Hello, Charles.

03:05.840 --> 03:11.040
- Who's Charles?
- The guests are arriving, dear.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.400
It's nearly time for the wedding.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.160
This isn't funny.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.520
There are more things
on heaven and earth

03:19.520 --> 03:22.440
- than you ould ever dream of.
- Says who?

03:22.440 --> 03:24.440
Hamlet-- his father's ghost
made him do things

03:24.440 --> 03:26.800
- that he didn't want to do.
- Like what?

03:26.800 --> 03:29.120
Like kill his uncle
for marrying his mother.

03:29.120 --> 03:32.240
- Nice.
- Glad we're not in that family.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.520
I don't believe in ghosts anyways.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.960
What's this?

03:49.560 --> 03:52.200
I didn't know you could ride.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.600
I can't.
Mom won't let me.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.680
This is Aunt Dora,
and that's her horse-- Mirage.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.720
- She sure looked like you.
- [squeaking]

04:01.720 --> 04:06.840
- Let's go.
- No, no. It's coming from in there.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.760
Well, come on. Help me.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.880
Look. There's a name.

04:23.880 --> 04:28.000
Dora Pease, 1963.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.760
[squeaking]

04:29.760 --> 04:31.560
Come on.
This is to creepy.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.760
It's probably just a mouse.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.640
No. We shouldn't touch it.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.960
Mom says
"Let the dead rest in peace."

04:40.960 --> 04:42.880
[squeaking]

04:42.880 --> 04:45.600
Look.
There's a little mouse hole.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.960
- [ahem]
- Hey, in there.

04:48.960 --> 04:51.560
Tell us the combination,
and we'll let you free.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.560
[woman]
Pam! Amy! Come on down now.

04:53.560 --> 04:57.320
It's time to feed the dog.
Let's go.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.120
[squeaking]

05:09.120 --> 05:13.520
I can't believe that I have to
spend my entire summer here.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.640
What do you do for fun,
anyway?

05:16.640 --> 05:20.200
Promise you won't tell?
Let's go.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.800
His owners live in the city.
The only come here on weekends.

05:30.800 --> 05:35.240
- Does it bite?
- Nah, he's just a big baby. Watch.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.200
Come here.

05:38.880 --> 05:43.360
- Oh, good boy.
- So he's like a big dog. So what?

05:43.360 --> 05:45.160
Watch this.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.920
[engine approaches]

05:48.920 --> 05:50.720
[car horn]

05:51.440 --> 05:52.160
Oh!

05:53.240 --> 05:54.480
Pam!

05:54.480 --> 05:57.080
Are you all right?

05:58.560 --> 05:59.880
The animals are dangerous.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.440
I told you never to go near them.

06:02.440 --> 06:05.920
It wouldn't be dangerous
if I knew how to ride.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.960
Can't I just take some lessons?

06:07.960 --> 06:12.000
No, and I wish you wouldn't
bring the subject up again.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.760
It's dinnertime.
Let's go home.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.000
But it's safe in a ring.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.400
- I don't want to discuss it.
- Mom, it happened 30 years ago.

06:19.400 --> 06:22.440
Seems like yesterday to me.

06:24.280 --> 06:27.520
I think you better give it a rest.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.520
Won't work with just one person.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.560
This is feeble.

06:45.560 --> 06:49.960
Don't you do anything around
here except play games?

06:49.960 --> 06:52.840
What are we going
to do next, Jethro?

06:52.840 --> 06:54.080
Shuck some corn?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.760
Come on. Humor me.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.600
I found it in the attic.

06:58.600 --> 07:02.040
The spirits are supposed to give us
messages from the other world.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.560
Maybe they can tell us
where to get pizza.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.640
- Amy.
- I'm sorry.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.760
Let's visit the far side.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.600
Mom said that she
and Aunt Dora

07:10.600 --> 07:13.160
used to do this
when they were kids.

07:16.360 --> 07:20.320
- You're doing this, right?
No.

07:22.560 --> 07:23.640
L... E...

07:26.120 --> 07:27.120
T...

07:28.200 --> 07:29.200
M...

07:31.200 --> 07:32.280
E... O...

07:34.600 --> 07:35.680
U... T...

07:40.000 --> 07:44.720
- LETMEOUT.
- No. It spelled "Let me out."

07:44.720 --> 07:46.520
Let me out?

07:46.520 --> 07:51.120
Maybe it's that rodent calling
from Aunt Dora's box.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.120
1... 4...

07:59.400 --> 08:00.400
9...

08:05.440 --> 08:07.040
What if it works?

08:07.040 --> 08:09.480
We're just going to open it up
and tak a look.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.920
What's the big deal?

08:10.920 --> 08:13.480
Yeah, but you saw
how upset my mom got.

08:13.480 --> 08:14.960
It's like she's haunted
by her sister.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.920
- If she catches us--
- [squeaking]

08:17.920 --> 08:19.960
If it can fit through
that mouse hole,

08:20.640 --> 08:22.560
it's not big enough to hurt us.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.680
Yeah, but what if
it's something else?

08:25.680 --> 08:28.560
Like what?
Now, what were those numbers?

08:28.560 --> 08:31.600
1-4-9. I'm telling you,
this isn't going to work,

08:31.600 --> 08:33.520
and I don't even believe
in this stuff.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.480
Then you shouldn't be scared.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.120
[squeaking]

08:43.120 --> 08:45.920
Whoa, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

08:45.920 --> 08:48.920
What are we running from?
A mouse?

08:48.920 --> 08:52.480
You're the country cousin.
What are you scared of?

09:02.680 --> 09:06.840
Ohh... Cool.
It's all her riding stuff.

09:06.840 --> 09:09.920
It's all covered
with dirt and grass.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.440
Yuck.

09:11.440 --> 09:16.040
Looks like they never washed it
after the last time she wore it.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.080
What are you doing?

09:55.880 --> 09:57.760
Are you...

10:01.440 --> 10:02.160
Night?

10:03.440 --> 10:05.480
It's not night.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.440
What is this?

10:24.480 --> 10:26.080
Pam!

10:39.840 --> 10:43.600
Pam, come on.
Let's go back, OK?

10:52.200 --> 10:53.280
[barking]

11:00.120 --> 11:03.240
It must be time for dinner.

11:03.240 --> 11:07.320
Don't you have to
feed the dog or something?

11:12.160 --> 11:14.720
OK. Ha ha! Good job.

11:14.720 --> 11:17.360
You've totally creeped me.

11:19.080 --> 11:22.240
OK. I deserve it.
I've been a pain.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.440
Now let's go back.

11:39.640 --> 11:40.480
Oh, no.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.960
Paul Pease.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.960
Noel Pease.

12:05.280 --> 12:08.440
It's all our family for 100 years.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.680
"As you are, so was I.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.760
As I am, so will you be."

12:19.200 --> 12:21.080
Nice thought.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.920
Aunt Dora's grave.

12:31.920 --> 12:34.960
Why did you bring me here?

12:41.600 --> 12:44.640
What is that? A bone?

12:44.640 --> 12:49.600
- Mon Petit Rouge.
- What?

12:51.040 --> 12:56.640
- Mon Petit Rouge.
- What is happening to you?

12:56.640 --> 12:59.600
It's a gift from the fox.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.960
He leaves me presents.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.800
Very nice. Now...

13:05.800 --> 13:07.360
let's go.

13:19.240 --> 13:22.640
I called him Mon Petit Rouge--

13:22.640 --> 13:26.560
my little red one.
I fed him each day.

13:26.560 --> 13:31.680
He looked at me through the cage
with his little golden eyes.

13:31.680 --> 13:35.120
I know. Let's travel
back to earth now, OK?

13:36.600 --> 13:40.480
I didn't want the hounds
to tear him apart,

13:40.480 --> 13:44.200
but they were ravenous
and howling for the hunt.

13:46.240 --> 13:50.080
The day of the hunt,
I got up before dawn

13:50.080 --> 13:52.120
to see Mon Petit Rouge.

13:52.120 --> 13:54.800
He was shivering in his cage.

13:56.440 --> 14:01.920
I opened the door, and
I let him run free in the barn.

14:01.920 --> 14:07.440
The hounds could hear him,
and they could smell him.

14:07.440 --> 14:10.320
- They were going crazy.
- I know the feeling.

14:10.320 --> 14:15.520
I opened the barn door,
and he seemed to smile at me,

14:15.520 --> 14:18.280
and then he ran away.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.440
The hounds were furious.

14:22.440 --> 14:26.280
I wanted to ride after him
before the hunters came,

14:26.280 --> 14:31.040
so I saddled up Mirage,
and we raced over the hills.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.560
But...

14:32.560 --> 14:37.640
but then something startled him,
and he shied before a jump...

14:39.560 --> 14:42.960
And he tripped.
And...

14:42.960 --> 14:45.240
and we fell together.

14:45.240 --> 14:48.160
Pam, your imagination
is running away with you.

14:48.160 --> 14:51.680
You are Pam.
You're not Dora.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.200
Hello, Dora.

15:02.520 --> 15:06.720
I was wondering when
you'd get around to your chores.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.040
I've come to feed the hounds.

15:09.040 --> 15:15.680
You should have fed them
while they were alive.

15:15.680 --> 15:22.960
- I couldn't get back until now.
- I was all torn up when you died.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.480
Ohh...

15:24.480 --> 15:26.560
My little Dora.

15:26.560 --> 15:29.920
She is not Dora.

15:29.920 --> 15:35.160
When I found them,
they were nearly starved.

15:36.600 --> 15:41.080
They leapt at me.
I couldn't keep them down.

15:41.080 --> 15:44.600
I... I got away,
but my heart...

15:44.600 --> 15:47.520
- my heart!
- I'm sorry, Giles.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.520
Why didn't you feed the hounds?

15:49.520 --> 15:52.000
The barn! Run!

16:00.880 --> 16:03.480
- [growl]
- What was that?

16:03.480 --> 16:06.080
I can't see a thing!

16:06.080 --> 16:08.160
[barking]

16:18.040 --> 16:20.600
What was happening
to you back there?

16:20.600 --> 16:23.960
- Who was that guy?
- Giles was the stablekeeper.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.840
[door locks]

16:27.200 --> 16:28.560
[dog barks]

16:28.560 --> 16:31.480
What's the matter, Elvis?
Smell a fox?

16:31.480 --> 16:32.920
Maybe he's scared.

16:32.920 --> 16:36.240
- Maybe he's hungry.
- Ha ha ha!

16:38.240 --> 16:40.160
Who locked the girls
in the barn?

16:40.160 --> 16:44.400
It might have been Giles, or
it might have been another ghost

16:44.400 --> 16:45.840
from the family graveyard.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.120
[rattling door]

16:49.120 --> 16:51.600
There's got to be
another way out of here.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.400
I have to feed the hounds.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.080
Don't get strange on me again.
Please?

16:56.080 --> 16:59.040
They're trapped in there,
starved, and it's all my fault.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.600
You listen to me.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.880
You are not Dora.
You're Pam.

17:02.880 --> 17:06.920
It's not your fault,
and it wasn't her fault, either.

17:06.920 --> 17:11.079
It's that jacket.
Take off the jacket!

17:11.079 --> 17:14.119
Dora, listen to me.

17:14.119 --> 17:17.319
- [barking]
- We're your nieces.

17:17.319 --> 17:22.000
- You're inside Pam's body.
- Nonsense. I have no nieces.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.599
My brother and my sister
are 10 years old.

17:25.599 --> 17:28.480
Now, I've got to feed those hounds.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.000
They're starved
before a hunt, you know.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.440
- What if they attack us?
- They must be fed.

17:34.440 --> 17:38.480
Pam!
Dora, don't open that door!

17:42.480 --> 17:45.600
Let me go.
I have to feed the hounds.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.120
Not until you let Pam
back into her own body.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.840
Forget it.
I'm going for help.

17:49.840 --> 17:52.480
- No!
- You don't know the way.

17:52.480 --> 17:55.320
I'll show you if you
let me feed the hounds.

17:55.320 --> 17:58.000
What are you going
to feed them? Me?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.560
Kibble. Now let me out,
and I'll get it.

18:00.560 --> 18:03.520
No way.
Tell me where it is.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.080
[growling]

18:05.080 --> 18:08.320
If you don't tell me,
we're both dog meat.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.920
Over there by the ladder.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.720
The ladder.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.320
Pam! No!

19:15.320 --> 19:18.880
- They're so hungry.
- [dogs whining]

19:18.880 --> 19:21.520
Wait till I get
the kibble over there!

19:23.160 --> 19:26.880
- We'll throw it to them.
- [growling]

19:26.880 --> 19:31.000
Bounder, Rexy, Helga,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.160
Brutus, you can come out now.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.960
I have something for you.

19:35.960 --> 19:36.960
Pam!

19:37.800 --> 19:40.840
Dora, don't open that door!

19:41.840 --> 19:42.600
No!

20:10.560 --> 20:14.560
[door opening]

20:28.000 --> 20:30.920
Mon Petit Rouge!
He saved us!

20:30.920 --> 20:31.920
Pam?

20:33.240 --> 20:36.520
Pam, where are you?

20:58.280 --> 21:00.040
Pam?

21:02.720 --> 21:04.920
Wait!

21:05.920 --> 21:07.920
Come back!

21:35.400 --> 21:38.160
What am I going to tell Aunt Beth?

21:38.160 --> 21:42.480
- Tell her about what?
- Pam! Are you OK?

21:42.480 --> 21:43.880
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.560
It's just my allergies
and all this dust.

21:46.560 --> 21:49.560
Let's go downstairs.
This place is haunted.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.800
I thought you didn't
believe in ghosts.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.920
Come on.
I got to go feed the dogs.

21:54.920 --> 21:58.080
What dogs?
You only have one.

21:58.080 --> 22:00.840
That's what I said.
I have to feed the dog.

22:00.840 --> 22:04.440
You said dogs.
You said, "I have to feed the dogs."

22:04.440 --> 22:06.240
- Did not.
- You did too.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.200
- Did not!
- Did too!

22:08.200 --> 22:10.720
Who cares what I said?
What's wrong with you?

22:10.720 --> 22:12.280
Nothing.
Nothing. I'm fine.

22:12.280 --> 22:13.800
I'm OK.

22:13.800 --> 22:17.240
OK. Rexy's hungry,
and I'm going to go feed him now.

22:17.240 --> 22:18.560
OK.

22:18.560 --> 22:19.320
OK.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.960
I have just the thing.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.440
After that,
Pam tried one more time

22:35.440 --> 22:39.320
to convince her mother
to let her take riding lesson,

22:39.320 --> 22:44.240
and it finally worked because
her mom no longer haunted

22:44.240 --> 22:45.920
by her sister Dora,

22:45.920 --> 22:48.960
and Dora's ghost
was no longer tormented

22:48.960 --> 22:52.680
by the howling
of the hungry hounds.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.080
The End.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.960
[Elvis whimpers]

22:59.280 --> 23:02.320
I declare this meeting
of the Midnight Society closed,

23:02.320 --> 23:04.960
and don't forget
to feed your dog,

23:04.960 --> 23:08.040
or he may have a bone
to pick with you.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.520
Ohh...
