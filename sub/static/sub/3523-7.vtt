01:39.866 --> 01:42.368
I want you to count
backwards from 10.

01:43.870 --> 01:47.373
10, nine...

01:50.877 --> 01:52.879
mr. Soprano,

01:52.879 --> 01:54.247
there's someon
e here to see you.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.636
Even here
you hector me?

02:00.136 --> 02:02.505
The director has authorized
us to make you an offer.

02:02.889 --> 02:04.891
Give up your nephew
tony, cooperate fully,

02:05.391 --> 02:06.509
help take him down.

02:06.509 --> 02:07.393
What do i get?

02:07.393 --> 02:08.761
A guaranteed cure.

02:08.761 --> 02:10.263
No more cancer?

02:10.263 --> 02:12.265
Not a single
diseased cell.

02:22.909 --> 02:25.411
I'm happy for you.

02:25.411 --> 02:28.414
I know you've
waited a long time...

02:28.414 --> 02:30.917
stay home, clip your
coupons, be a happy man.

02:30.917 --> 02:34.420
Don't let certain people
take advantage...

02:34.420 --> 02:35.922
i'm kiddin' you,
you old fuck.

02:35.922 --> 02:37.924
Peppers and eggs.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.425
Dr. Kennedy...

02:39.425 --> 02:41.194
it's dr. Enloe...

02:41.594 --> 02:43.796
i have the results
of the frozen section.

02:43.796 --> 02:45.798
Can we move this
along, dr. Enloe?

02:46.199 --> 02:48.201
I have a thyroid in
o. R. Six at 10:30.

02:48.201 --> 02:50.720
Based on the preliminary
results of the frozen section

02:51.221 --> 02:54.224
and depending, of cour
se, on the full path report--

02:54.224 --> 02:56.726
is it clean,
enloe, or not?

02:56.726 --> 02:59.229
Yes, it's clean.

02:59.229 --> 03:00.730
Miles, you close.

03:00.730 --> 03:03.233
Let's do it quickly,
i've got his bp back up,

03:03.233 --> 03:04.734
but i don't know
how long it'll hold.

03:04.734 --> 03:06.486
Watch and
learn, miles.

03:06.486 --> 03:08.988
Watch and learn.

03:16.996 --> 03:18.498
Well?

03:21.501 --> 03:24.504
Your uncle
is a very strong
man, mr. Soprano.

03:24.504 --> 03:26.005
He did very well.

03:26.005 --> 03:27.507
The news is
all good.

03:27.507 --> 03:29.008
Beautiful.

03:29.008 --> 03:30.009
So, the
cancer is...

03:30.510 --> 03:31.511
gone?
You bet.

03:31.511 --> 03:34.013
I took a tumor
the size of a fist
out of his stomach.

03:34.013 --> 03:35.515
Madonn'.

03:35.515 --> 03:37.016
So, if you'll
excuse me,

03:37.016 --> 03:38.017
i have another
patient waiting.

03:40.019 --> 03:41.771
Cheryl, make sure
that marty gets

03:41.771 --> 03:43.773
doc?
That goldman- sachs statement.

03:43.773 --> 03:44.274
Yes?

03:44.274 --> 03:45.775
I...

03:45.775 --> 03:47.277
just want to
say thanks.

03:47.777 --> 03:49.779
You know, my uncle
thinks the world of you.

03:49.779 --> 03:53.783
If there's ever anything i
can do, a favor, anything,

03:53.783 --> 03:55.785
let me know.

03:55.785 --> 03:57.787
I'll keep that in
mind, mr. Soprano.

04:03.927 --> 04:05.929
Game three.

04:07.430 --> 04:08.932
That's $60.

04:08.932 --> 04:10.683
Good luck
getting it.

04:10.683 --> 04:13.553
I fuckin' won,
paulie, it's only
right you pay me.

04:13.553 --> 04:14.554
And for other
things too.

04:15.054 --> 04:16.189
Like what?

04:16.305 --> 04:18.808
Fuckin' dom perignon
for everybody in the skybox

04:18.808 --> 04:20.310
at the garde
n the other night.

04:20.310 --> 04:22.312
Check comes,
suddenly you're m. I. A.

04:22.312 --> 04:25.315
Chrissy, you're
too fucking worried
about what i give you.

04:25.315 --> 04:27.951
Worry a little more
about what you give me.

04:27.951 --> 04:29.953
Blow me with your
lectures, paulie.

04:29.953 --> 04:32.322
Kid, you wearing
a wire?

04:33.323 --> 04:35.325
Are you
fucking crazy?

04:35.708 --> 04:37.210
Pasqual,
pat him down.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.461
He fuckin'
touches me...

04:38.461 --> 04:40.079
then make it easy
on all us all.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.665
Take'em off...
everything.

04:42.665 --> 04:46.302
New york reopened the books,
but they also laid it down.

04:46.302 --> 04:48.304
Probationary period.

04:48.421 --> 04:52.058
When i was coming up
this would never happen
to new made guys.

04:52.558 --> 04:55.061
But too many people
are doin' a simulcast.

04:55.561 --> 04:57.063
Maybe you,
you fuck.

04:59.565 --> 05:02.185
Do me a favor and don't
take it personally.

05:14.947 --> 05:16.582
I said everything.

05:16.582 --> 05:17.700
Go fuck yourself.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.202
Before i was
breaking balls,

05:19.202 --> 05:21.704
now, you're beginning
to worry me.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.969
I guess you could
call that a dick.

05:44.227 --> 05:46.229
You're going,
young man, that's
all there is to it.

05:46.229 --> 05:48.231
Jason mangelli
isn't going.

05:48.231 --> 05:50.233
Tony, you wanna
weigh in here?

05:52.735 --> 05:53.736
Tony?

05:55.738 --> 05:57.240
What?

05:57.240 --> 05:58.241
The washington trip?

05:58.241 --> 06:01.494
No, you're gonna be on tha
t school bus to d. C. Tomorrow.

06:01.994 --> 06:04.497
You're all packed and paid f
and you're gonna pay attention

06:04.497 --> 06:06.499
and you're gonna
learn something
for a change.

06:06.499 --> 06:08.501
We're going to
fbi headquarters.

06:10.503 --> 06:12.004
So?

06:15.508 --> 06:17.510
Excuse me.

06:22.014 --> 06:24.517
What did you do
to this'scarrole?

06:24.517 --> 06:26.018
It's delicious.

06:26.018 --> 06:28.020
Balsamic.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.022
That's all they ha
ve at king's these days.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.525
Balsamic,
balsamic, balsamic.

06:32.525 --> 06:35.528
My mother never
heard of balsamic.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.029
I gotta go.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.031
Problems at work.

06:39.031 --> 06:40.032
It's sunday
dinner, tony.

06:40.032 --> 06:41.033
I know.

06:41.033 --> 06:42.535
I gotta go.

06:42.535 --> 06:44.036
Alright, hug
h, see you later.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.425
Can i be
excused too?

06:49.425 --> 06:51.177
No, you may not.

06:51.177 --> 06:53.045
He's got homework
to finish before
the trip.

06:53.546 --> 06:54.547
Go ahead, anthony.

06:56.432 --> 06:59.435
It's a nice
example he sets
for his son.

06:59.435 --> 07:00.436
Ma...

07:00.436 --> 07:02.438
the man's got
two speeds...

07:02.939 --> 07:04.440
moping or yelling...

07:04.440 --> 07:05.942
when he's here.

07:05.942 --> 07:07.443
He's got an uncle
sick with cancer.

07:07.443 --> 07:08.444
Oh, please.

07:08.945 --> 07:10.446
They didn't
speak for a year.

07:10.446 --> 07:13.950
Actually, if you
must know, tony has
been a little better.

07:18.454 --> 07:21.457
We've been seeing
his therapist together.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.301
What?

07:32.301 --> 07:35.304
He's no angelo
stamfa, that's all.

07:35.304 --> 07:36.806
What is that
supposed to mean?

07:36.806 --> 07:38.808
You know angelo was
dying to marry you

07:38.808 --> 07:41.811
and now, stamfa's is
a chain of drugstores.

07:41.811 --> 07:43.813
So, what, he doesn't
need therapy?

07:44.313 --> 07:45.815
He prescribes his
own tranquilizers?

07:45.815 --> 07:47.316
Don't be
so sensitive.

07:47.316 --> 07:48.317
What sensitive?

07:48.317 --> 07:50.319
I gotta hear this
angelo stamfa shit again?

07:59.328 --> 08:00.830
All i was
saying was--

08:00.830 --> 08:02.832
i know wha
t you were saying.

08:02.832 --> 08:04.834
Hugh, bring
your plate!

08:04.834 --> 08:08.337
You are blowing this
all out of proportion.

08:08.337 --> 08:10.590
We worry about
you, that's all.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.592
Spare me your
concern, alright?

08:13.092 --> 08:14.594
And spare me
your attitude too.

08:14.594 --> 08:16.095
Or maybe you forgot,

08:16.095 --> 08:19.098
dad's little strip mall on
route 17 was zoned residential

08:19.098 --> 08:20.600
until tony made
a phone call.

08:21.100 --> 08:21.601
Bullshit.

08:21.601 --> 08:23.603
Oh, really, dad?

08:23.603 --> 08:25.605
The contract you got t
o do at sparta high
for the hurricanes repairs.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.607
What, all the
other builders were
too busy to bid?

08:27.607 --> 08:29.358
Oh, please,
my heart bleeds.

08:29.859 --> 08:32.361
What, the waters
don't part for you
wherever you go?

08:32.361 --> 08:33.863
I earn it.

08:33.863 --> 08:35.865
You two get
a free pass.

08:40.236 --> 08:41.236
Hey.

08:41.236 --> 08:42.238
Ton', what's up?

08:42.238 --> 08:43.739
Hey, tony.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.762
Anyway, four
dollars a pound.

09:09.765 --> 09:11.767
Who brought
this in here?

09:11.767 --> 09:13.269
Georgie.

09:13.269 --> 09:14.770
It's wacky, huh?

09:21.777 --> 09:24.280
What do you think,
it's a fuckin'
playroom back there?

09:24.280 --> 09:25.781
What, ton'?

09:25.781 --> 09:27.283
What, what, fuckin'
toys? This is a
place of business.

09:27.783 --> 09:28.784
That's an office
back there!

09:28.784 --> 09:31.287
I saw it at rite- a
id, they were selling'em.

09:31.287 --> 09:32.788
What? What
did you say?

09:32.788 --> 09:34.290
Ah!

09:36.292 --> 09:38.294
I pay you a
fuckin' salary!

09:58.314 --> 10:00.316
Carmela...

10:11.327 --> 10:15.331
you sounded tense
on the phone.

10:16.332 --> 10:17.833
Ah...

10:17.833 --> 10:22.338
i just wanted to make sure
it was okay if i came alone.

10:22.338 --> 10:24.840
I mean, because tony
couldn't make it.

10:32.348 --> 10:35.351
I love the artwork
you have out there,

10:35.351 --> 10:36.352
those country scenes.

10:36.352 --> 10:37.853
Thank you.

10:38.854 --> 10:41.357
That statue is
not my favorite.

10:51.867 --> 10:53.869
Oh, come on...

10:53.869 --> 10:55.871
look, it's not lik
e this when me and ton
y are here together.

10:55.871 --> 10:57.373
You never give him
the silent treatment.

10:57.873 --> 10:58.874
Is that what
you think?

10:58.874 --> 11:01.377
I'm giving you the
silent treatment?

11:03.379 --> 11:06.882
Maybe you could tell me
why you came today.

11:08.384 --> 11:10.386
I'm worried
about my husband.

11:10.386 --> 11:12.388
The mood swings.

11:12.888 --> 11:14.890
I thought...

11:15.391 --> 11:17.893
when his mother
died, maybe...

11:20.396 --> 11:24.400
but still half the tim
e he doesn't even talk to me.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.402
You've seen him
get like that,

11:26.902 --> 11:28.904
that day he sat
here like a wall.

11:28.904 --> 11:31.407
I know that
he's your patient

11:31.407 --> 11:32.908
and i am only
the patient's wife,

11:33.409 --> 11:35.911
but you try living with
that 24 hours a day,
seven days a week,

11:35.911 --> 11:36.912
see how you feel.

11:36.912 --> 11:37.913
I see.

11:37.913 --> 11:39.415
Oh, you do?

11:39.415 --> 11:42.918
Well, for your information
, i am not the only one.

11:42.918 --> 11:45.421
The fact is, tony isn'
t under the weather today,

11:45.921 --> 11:47.923
he just didn't
feel like coming.

11:47.923 --> 11:49.925
"Fuck that shit",
i think he said, okay?

11:50.426 --> 11:52.928
Usually happens when
we touch on a nerve.

11:53.429 --> 11:56.932
He was distressed about
this young man's death

11:56.932 --> 11:59.435
in the garbage
compactor.

11:59.435 --> 12:03.439
See, he didn't say,
"garbage compactor",
did he?

12:05.441 --> 12:06.942
See?

12:06.942 --> 12:08.944
What is it
you believe?

12:08.944 --> 12:10.446
You know
about his job.

12:10.446 --> 12:11.947
He reports to
a strip club.

12:11.947 --> 12:13.949
Who knows how he
spends his days?

12:31.467 --> 12:32.468
I'm sorry.

12:32.968 --> 12:34.470
I'm just frustrated,
that's all.

12:34.470 --> 12:36.972
Tony's been out of
sorts, for so long

12:36.972 --> 12:38.474
and there is...

12:38.474 --> 12:40.476
there is nothing
i can do to help him.

12:40.476 --> 12:42.478
I think coming to
therapy with him

12:42.478 --> 12:44.980
has stirred up a lot
of feelings in you

12:44.980 --> 12:47.983
that you would like
to address with somebody.

12:48.484 --> 12:49.485
Oh, please.

12:49.485 --> 12:51.487
I'm just a little
emotional today.

12:51.987 --> 12:53.489
I would like
to help you,

12:53.489 --> 12:56.992
but as you've pointed out,
your husband is my patient.

12:56.992 --> 12:59.995
I'm not the one
who needs mental help.

12:59.995 --> 13:01.497
I just needed
to vent.

13:03.999 --> 13:06.502
In case you
change your mind,

13:06.502 --> 13:11.006
here's the number
of a colleague
in livingston.

13:20.015 --> 13:22.518
He was a teacher
of mine.

13:23.018 --> 13:25.521
That really
won't be necessary,

13:25.521 --> 13:27.523
but thank you
anyway.

13:30.025 --> 13:31.527
Thank you
for your time.

13:44.039 --> 13:46.542
You took
these yourself?

13:46.542 --> 13:49.545
That's a samoan village
i lived in for a month.

13:49.545 --> 13:51.046
You could send these int
o "national geographic".

13:51.046 --> 13:56.051
So, i got back
your complete
surgical pathology

13:56.051 --> 13:57.553
and op reports.

13:58.053 --> 13:59.054
I feel 100%.

13:59.555 --> 14:00.556
That's good.

14:00.556 --> 14:03.058
It's possible though...

14:03.058 --> 14:07.062
that there may
be some malignant
cells we didn't get.

14:08.564 --> 14:10.065
See, when
we operate,

14:10.065 --> 14:13.068
we have to decide
how much healthy tissue

14:13.068 --> 14:15.070
to cut around
the tumor.

14:15.571 --> 14:16.572
Alright?

14:16.572 --> 14:19.575
The margins
weren't wide enough.

14:19.575 --> 14:23.078
We took a small sampling
of the tumor from
the frozen section,

14:23.078 --> 14:24.580
when we got back
the complete results,

14:24.580 --> 14:26.582
it showed
nodal involvement.

14:26.582 --> 14:29.084
Don't blame
yourself, doc.

14:29.084 --> 14:31.587
So, what do
we do next?

14:32.087 --> 14:33.088
It's called
amended surgery.

14:33.589 --> 14:34.590
Oh, jesus.

14:34.590 --> 14:36.091
Cut me again?

14:37.593 --> 14:39.094
Mrs. Brody is here.

14:39.094 --> 14:40.596
Don't let me
keep you, doc.

14:40.596 --> 14:42.097
I am kinda
backed up.

14:42.097 --> 14:45.601
Let's schedule you
for tuesday at six a. M.

14:45.601 --> 14:47.603
We can admit and prep
you monday night.

14:47.603 --> 14:49.605
Any questions?

14:49.605 --> 14:52.107
When can h
e eat regula
r food again?

14:52.608 --> 14:53.609
I'd guess two weeks.

14:54.109 --> 14:57.613
Let's fill out the
surgical consent forms.

14:57.613 --> 15:00.115
That's one less thing you have
to deal with in the hospital.

15:00.115 --> 15:02.117
Take all the time
you need to read them.

15:02.117 --> 15:04.119
No need,
you say sign,
i sign.

15:04.620 --> 15:06.622
You tell me to take a crap
on the deck of the queen mary,

15:07.122 --> 15:09.625
an hour later, they're hosin
her down with disinfectant.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.627
I owe you
everything, doc.

15:11.627 --> 15:14.129
How do i know what
nodal involvement means?

15:14.129 --> 15:16.131
Didn't you
fuckin' listen?

15:16.131 --> 15:19.134
A whole issue
of "u. S. News" on
seniors and health.

15:19.134 --> 15:21.637
Bring somebody
with you to the
doctor's, it said.

15:22.137 --> 15:23.639
Somebody to
ask questions.

15:23.639 --> 15:26.642
You ask one dumb fuckin'
question about my diet.

15:48.664 --> 15:50.165
Angie?

15:50.165 --> 15:51.667
Carmela!

15:51.667 --> 15:53.168
Hi.
Hi.

15:53.168 --> 15:55.170
What a surprise.

15:55.170 --> 15:57.172
I didn't know you
shopped over here.

15:57.172 --> 15:59.675
They're running
a special on iams.

15:59.675 --> 16:01.677
Every penny
counts these days.

16:02.177 --> 16:05.681
How are you doing,
angie, with pussy gone?

16:05.681 --> 16:07.182
Oh, you know.

16:07.182 --> 16:09.685
I'll tell you, shopping
for one is no picnic.

16:09.685 --> 16:11.186
Why don't you
come for dinner?

16:11.186 --> 16:12.688
It's jus
t me and tony,

16:12.688 --> 16:14.189
with med at school
, a. J. 's on a field trip.

16:14.189 --> 16:16.692
Who knows, maybe we'll g
et lucky and tony won't show.

16:21.697 --> 16:23.699
That's coco's
worst time of the day.

16:24.199 --> 16:25.200
I can't leave her.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.201
Angie, that dog is
not a substitute

16:26.702 --> 16:28.203
for human contact.

16:28.203 --> 16:30.706
That french poodle is
all i got left of sal.

16:30.706 --> 16:34.209
24 years, he disappears
one day, and i get
left with a sick dog.

16:34.209 --> 16:36.211
The vet says i
should put her down,

16:36.211 --> 16:38.714
but i want her to get
another operation.

16:38.714 --> 16:40.215
I remember when
sal was around

16:40.215 --> 16:42.217
there was nothing too
good for that dog.

16:42.217 --> 16:45.220
Yeah, but where am i
gonna come up with $1200?

16:45.220 --> 16:49.224
I mean, tony helps out
and i am so grateful.

16:49.224 --> 16:50.225
It covers
the basics,

16:50.726 --> 16:53.729
but anything extra,
there's no way, carmela.

16:53.729 --> 16:55.731
Jeez, ang,
i'm sorry.

16:55.731 --> 16:57.232
That must be
so tough.

16:57.232 --> 17:00.235
I told the wallpaper
guy that this was okay.

17:00.736 --> 17:02.237
Well, why
did you do that?

17:02.237 --> 17:04.740
Because i didn't want to deal
with your parents anymore.

17:04.740 --> 17:09.744
Anybody around here love
the word "jimmy choo shoes"?

17:09.744 --> 17:12.748
No way!

17:16.251 --> 17:18.252
Oh, my god.

17:18.753 --> 17:20.255
They're gorgeous!

17:20.255 --> 17:24.259
Or would the lady
prefer something in...

17:24.259 --> 17:25.761
gold?

17:25.761 --> 17:27.262
Say a nice...

17:27.262 --> 17:30.265
i don't know,
whatever the
fuck that is.

17:35.771 --> 17:37.272
They're all
yours, baby.

17:37.272 --> 17:39.775
And they're from next seas
you can't even buy them yet.

17:44.279 --> 17:45.781
What size
are these?

17:46.281 --> 17:46.782
10.

17:46.782 --> 17:47.783
10?

17:48.283 --> 17:49.785
That's sasquatch
size, christopher.

17:49.785 --> 17:51.286
I'm an 8. 5.

17:51.286 --> 17:53.789
Fuck, fuck, fuck...

17:53.789 --> 17:54.790
where'd i
get 10 from?

17:54.790 --> 17:56.291
Yeah, where?

17:58.794 --> 18:02.297
So, now what happens?

18:02.297 --> 18:03.799
You gotta give
'em all back?

18:03.799 --> 18:04.800
Temporarily.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.802
I'll get you
8. 5's tomorrow.

18:07.302 --> 18:08.804
All of'em?

18:09.304 --> 18:10.806
You swear?

18:11.306 --> 18:12.307
More even.

18:16.311 --> 18:17.813
Since you been
, you know...

18:17.813 --> 18:19.314
"in",

18:19.314 --> 18:21.817
i just can't believe
the stuff we get.

18:21.817 --> 18:23.318
It's so great.

18:23.819 --> 18:26.321
Except for that
schmaccone paulie.

18:26.321 --> 18:28.824
Fuck him and the coupe
de ville he rode in on.

18:28.824 --> 18:31.326
He saying you're
holding back again?

18:31.326 --> 18:33.829
Like i'm gonna give
that prick a full share?

18:33.829 --> 18:35.831
C'mere.

18:40.335 --> 18:41.336
What do you say?

18:41.336 --> 18:44.339
I love you, baby.

18:44.840 --> 18:46.341
Oh, you fucking better.

18:46.341 --> 18:47.843
You better.

18:47.843 --> 18:49.344
I do.

19:00.355 --> 19:02.357
You could've
called.

19:02.357 --> 19:04.359
Now everything's cold.

19:04.359 --> 19:07.362
That's why the
y invented microwaves,

19:07.863 --> 19:10.365
for inconsiderate
husbands.

19:10.365 --> 19:11.867
It's just that
since we're alone,

19:12.367 --> 19:13.869
it would be nice to
have dinner together.

19:14.369 --> 19:15.871
Don't bust my
chops, carmela.

19:15.871 --> 19:17.372
I got a lot
on my mind.

19:23.378 --> 19:25.881
This is fuckin
' delicious.

19:25.881 --> 19:27.883
Really.

19:27.883 --> 19:29.384
Is this
the pecorino?

19:29.384 --> 19:30.886
Right.

19:30.886 --> 19:34.890
The hell with
heatin' it up,
it's good like this.

19:37.392 --> 19:39.895
I'm glad something
brings you joy.

19:41.897 --> 19:44.900
You're amazing,
your cookin'.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.902
I'm having lunch
with our daughter's
dean tomorrow.

19:47.402 --> 19:48.403
I gather you
won't be joining me.

19:48.403 --> 19:51.406
I told you, all he
wants is our money.

19:51.406 --> 19:53.408
Fine.

19:53.408 --> 19:54.910
We already shell
out 40 grand a
year to those people.

19:54.910 --> 19:56.411
It's well spent.

19:56.411 --> 19:57.913
She's really learning,
she's out on her own.

19:57.913 --> 19:59.414
And if she
passes us by--

19:59.414 --> 20:00.415
if?

20:00.415 --> 20:01.917
She did that
when she was 14.

20:01.917 --> 20:04.920
Isn't that what you
want for your kids?

20:05.420 --> 20:06.421
No.

20:06.421 --> 20:08.423
I want them to be
backwards and ignorant

20:08.423 --> 20:09.925
and sit around wit
h their thumb up their ass

20:09.925 --> 20:12.427
and i'm gonna make sure
of that by not going to lunch

20:12.928 --> 20:14.429
with some asshole who's
trying to shake me down.

20:14.429 --> 20:16.932
Fine, tony,
don't go.

20:20.936 --> 20:23.939
Guess who i ran into
at the supermarket today.

20:24.439 --> 20:26.942
Angie bonpensiero.

20:29.945 --> 20:30.946
Really?

20:31.446 --> 20:33.949
How's she doing?

20:33.949 --> 20:35.951
Her dog is sick.

20:35.951 --> 20:40.956
What, that fluffy french
coco piece of shit?

20:40.956 --> 20:43.458
What's wro
ng with him?

20:43.458 --> 20:44.459
Her, osteoporosis.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.962
Angie needs money
for an operation.

20:48.964 --> 20:50.465
Well, take it
up with pussy.

20:50.465 --> 20:53.468
If you can find th
e fat fuck, wherever
the feds put him.

20:53.468 --> 20:57.472
I'd look in arizona,
you know, stake out
all the "tgi fridays".

20:57.472 --> 20:59.474
He loves
their wings.

20:59.474 --> 21:02.477
He left angie holding the
bag, which is not right.

21:02.477 --> 21:06.982
And those fbi family value
loving cocksuckers,

21:06.982 --> 21:09.484
how could they let him
go without his wife?

21:09.484 --> 21:10.485
Into the program?

21:10.986 --> 21:11.987
Yeah, that's right.

21:11.987 --> 21:13.989
He ratted us out, carm.

21:13.989 --> 21:14.990
Me and you.

21:14.990 --> 21:16.491
And that's
where he is

21:16.491 --> 21:17.993
and i don't want to hear
about him ever again.

21:17.993 --> 21:19.494
Or his ungrateful
cunt wife.

21:19.494 --> 21:21.997
His what wife?

21:26.001 --> 21:27.002
Okay...

21:27.502 --> 21:30.005
who was
your oldest?

21:30.005 --> 21:31.006
Easy.

21:31.006 --> 21:32.507
Chuckie periccio's
mother.

21:32.507 --> 21:33.508
Shut up!

21:33.508 --> 21:35.510
You had sex wi
th beverly periccio?

21:35.510 --> 21:36.511
Yeah.

21:36.511 --> 21:38.513
A whole
summer's worth.

21:40.015 --> 21:43.018
Okay, my turn.

21:43.018 --> 21:45.520
Who was your
most famous?

21:46.021 --> 21:47.522
And bobby ditillio
doesn't count,

21:48.023 --> 21:49.524
he's only famous
in new jersey.

21:49.524 --> 21:50.525
Okay...

21:51.026 --> 21:52.527
you know
penn and teller,

21:52.527 --> 21:54.029
the magicians?

21:54.029 --> 21:56.531
You fucked them?

21:56.531 --> 21:58.033
Penn.

21:58.033 --> 21:59.034
And i didn't
fuck him...

21:59.534 --> 22:01.036
i gave him head.

22:01.036 --> 22:02.037
Which one is he?

22:02.037 --> 22:03.538
The big one.

22:03.538 --> 22:05.040
They were playing a. C. ,
and they're funny as hell.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.541
I was ther
e with georgette.

22:07.042 --> 22:08.043
He followed me
into the ladies room

22:08.043 --> 22:09.544
and he asked--

22:09.544 --> 22:11.046
you lowlife
cunt whore.

22:11.546 --> 22:12.547
Get the fuck
out of my sight!

22:12.547 --> 22:14.049
Ow, you fucking
shitbag!

22:14.049 --> 22:15.550
In the fucking
bathroom?

22:26.061 --> 22:27.562
Who is it?

22:27.562 --> 22:29.064
The fbi.

22:29.064 --> 22:31.066
Come o
n, dickhead
, open up.

22:34.069 --> 22:36.571
For fuck's sake paulie,
it's two in the morning.

22:36.571 --> 22:37.572
I know.

22:37.572 --> 22:39.074
It's an outrage.

22:40.575 --> 22:42.077
Adriana,
you in there?

22:42.077 --> 22:43.078
Yeah.

22:43.078 --> 22:44.579
Sorry for the
intrusion, honey.

22:44.579 --> 22:46.081
Put something on
and come out here.

22:46.581 --> 22:48.583
You can't fuckin
' do this like this!

22:49.084 --> 22:50.085
I can't?

22:50.585 --> 22:52.587
You must've not read
up on the latest rules.

22:52.587 --> 22:55.090
And put
that piece away.

22:56.591 --> 22:59.094
What's all this?

22:59.094 --> 23:01.596
The berezovsky
brothers jacked
a shipment from milan

23:02.097 --> 23:03.098
off pier 87.

23:03.098 --> 23:04.599
These are for ade.

23:04.599 --> 23:05.600
Nice goods.

23:06.101 --> 23:07.602
My broad wears
a size 10.

23:08.103 --> 23:09.604
Patsy, pack up
some of these shoes.

23:10.105 --> 23:12.107
Chrissy, you don't mind
if i take my taste now?

23:14.109 --> 23:15.110
He's not
taking those.

23:15.610 --> 23:17.112
Make yourselves
comfortable.

23:17.612 --> 23:19.614
We'll just have a
little look around.

23:22.617 --> 23:24.619
I'm still gonna get
more shoes, right?

23:24.619 --> 23:27.622
I don't know, now i have t
o go into my pocket for'em.

23:34.629 --> 23:36.131
This really sucks,
christopher.

23:36.131 --> 23:38.133
You see the shit

23:48.143 --> 23:50.145
Motherfucker!

23:50.145 --> 23:51.146
What?

23:51.146 --> 23:53.148
Nothing!

24:47.202 --> 24:49.704
Leave it on,
it's nice.

25:17.732 --> 25:19.734
Meadow?

25:19.734 --> 25:22.737
Didn't you hear
me knocking?

25:22.737 --> 25:26.241
I was sleeping,
i thought it was vanessa.

25:34.749 --> 25:37.252
You don't answer the d
oor when your friends knock?

25:37.252 --> 25:39.754
They keep you
from studying.

25:39.754 --> 25:41.756
And my first class
isn't until two.

25:41.756 --> 25:44.759
I brought your laundry
and i made you the ziti

25:45.260 --> 25:46.761
with the sweet sausage
that you like.

25:46.761 --> 25:48.263
I'm so starved.

25:50.765 --> 25:52.767
Jesus, it reeks of
cigarettes in here.

25:52.767 --> 25:53.768
You're not smoking,
are you?

25:53.768 --> 25:55.770
Caitlin.

25:59.274 --> 26:01.776
I hope you're taki
ng advantage of some
of these offers here.

26:02.277 --> 26:03.278
Look at this.

26:03.278 --> 26:04.779
A boy just
handed this to me.

26:05.280 --> 26:08.283
A seminar on the cia
and the cultural cold war.

26:08.283 --> 26:09.784
Look at this.

26:13.288 --> 26:16.291
This looks
interesting.

26:17.292 --> 26:19.794
It's basic, we're
way past that.

26:19.794 --> 26:22.297
I'm reading the ne
w barbara kingsolver.

26:22.297 --> 26:25.300
I so wish i had
time for fiction.

26:27.302 --> 26:31.806
So, how is the drama
queen doing anyway?

26:31.806 --> 26:32.807
Fine.

26:32.807 --> 26:34.809
Can we not talk
about this, please?

26:34.809 --> 26:36.311
I'm trying very
hard here, med.

26:36.311 --> 26:37.812
If you want me to
leave, i will leave.

26:37.812 --> 26:39.814
I have an hour befor
e my lunch with dean ross.

26:39.814 --> 26:42.317
You're going to lunch
with the dean?

26:42.317 --> 26:44.319
Can we not talk about
this now, please?

26:44.319 --> 26:45.320
Mom!

26:45.820 --> 26:47.322
Yeah, his secretary called
last week and invited me.

26:47.322 --> 26:50.325
Come on,
what about?

26:50.325 --> 26:52.327
Money, i'm sure.

26:52.327 --> 26:54.329
They probably want
a donation from us.

26:54.329 --> 26:56.331
How corrupt.

26:58.333 --> 26:59.834
The real reason i stopped
by to see you though

27:00.335 --> 27:02.337
was to make sure
you're recovered
from this noah thing.

27:02.337 --> 27:04.339
I'm worried it
'll affect your grades.

27:04.339 --> 27:06.841
You call losing
a wonderful man
because of dad...

27:06.841 --> 27:08.343
a thing?

27:08.343 --> 27:10.345
Now, is that reall
y what happened?

27:10.345 --> 27:12.847
'Cause you certainly kept
seeing him plenty long enough

27:12.847 --> 27:14.849
after that business
with your father.

27:14.849 --> 27:16.851
Look, don't drag me
into whatever bullshit

27:16.851 --> 27:19.854
accommodational pretense
you've got worked
out with daddy.

27:19.854 --> 27:22.857
What was that, last night's
reading assignment?

27:25.360 --> 27:26.861
Alright...

27:29.364 --> 27:30.365
let's hear it.

27:30.365 --> 27:32.367
What's your big theory
about me and daddy?

27:32.367 --> 27:34.369
No way.

27:34.369 --> 27:36.371
I'm not
touching that.

28:00.395 --> 28:03.898
Oh, fuckin' bitch!

28:08.403 --> 28:09.904
Uncle jun', what the
hell are you doing?

28:12.407 --> 28:13.908
Those marshals see
you coming in here?

28:14.409 --> 28:16.911
'Cause i need being
remanded to a fucking
jail hospital

28:16.911 --> 28:19.914
right now like
i need a fuckin'
case of crabs.

28:21.416 --> 28:22.917
There's no car
out there today

28:23.418 --> 28:25.920
and i come up throug
h the cellar like always.

28:25.920 --> 28:27.422
Where the fuck
is bacala?

28:27.922 --> 28:28.923
He's supposed to b
e doing this shit for you.

28:29.424 --> 28:32.427
I sent him to
the drugstore
for more pepto.

28:35.930 --> 28:39.434
You're getting
better, that's the
important thing.

28:39.434 --> 28:40.935
You look better too.

28:40.935 --> 28:42.937
If you're
gonna lie to me,

28:42.937 --> 28:43.938
tell me there's a broa
d waiting in the car

28:43.938 --> 28:45.440
who wants to
tongue my balls.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.942
You want that, it's
a phone call away.

28:50.445 --> 28:52.447
You still
want this?

28:52.447 --> 28:54.449
I gotta get
nutrition somehow.

28:54.949 --> 28:58.453
Kennedy says eat
only what i ca
n sip through a straw.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.463
What's going on with y
ou and ralphie cifaretto?

29:08.463 --> 29:10.465
Bacala tells me
there's bad blood now.

29:10.465 --> 29:11.966
You don't got
enough in your plate?

29:12.467 --> 29:13.468
I mean, in
your blender?

29:13.968 --> 29:15.970
Worry about
your own problems.

29:17.472 --> 29:20.475
When'd they
say you could
eat real food?

29:20.475 --> 29:21.976
Who knows?

29:21.976 --> 29:23.478
Kennedy's putting
me under the knife again.

29:23.478 --> 29:25.480
Whoa, back up.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.481
More surgery?

29:26.481 --> 29:28.483
Don't think you should
talk to somebody else?

29:28.483 --> 29:29.984
Get a second opinion.

29:29.984 --> 29:30.985
Chemo?

29:30.985 --> 29:31.986
Forget it.

29:31.986 --> 29:34.989
With kennedy it's cut,
zip, over and out.

29:34.989 --> 29:36.991
He has the hands
of an angel.

29:36.991 --> 29:38.493
And don't
forget his name.

29:38.493 --> 29:39.494
What?

29:39.494 --> 29:40.495
I'm supposed to
be impressed

29:40.995 --> 29:41.996
'cause the man's name
is john kennedy?

29:41.996 --> 29:44.499
All the micks named their kids
that after the guy got killed.

29:44.999 --> 29:47.502
I loved that man.

29:49.504 --> 29:51.506
He was older than
me and now look.

29:53.007 --> 29:55.009
You were g
one a long time.

29:55.009 --> 29:56.010
How many
white castles
did you have?

29:56.010 --> 29:57.512
I didn't, i swear.

29:57.512 --> 29:59.013
I can smell them.

30:01.015 --> 30:02.517
Let me call
cusamano.

30:02.517 --> 30:04.018
He knows doctors
in the city.

30:04.018 --> 30:06.020
He sent silvio's
mother to one.

30:06.020 --> 30:08.022
It can't hurt
to make a call.

30:08.022 --> 30:10.024
People come from the
city to see kennedy.

30:10.525 --> 30:12.026
Good, then we won't
be fighting traffic.

30:12.527 --> 30:16.030
C'mon, uncle jun',
you know i'm right.

30:18.533 --> 30:21.536
Alright, you set it up
, you come with me...

30:22.036 --> 30:26.040
to listen and
ask questions.

30:27.542 --> 30:29.043
Good, good.

30:29.544 --> 30:30.545
I'll let you
know, alright?

30:31.045 --> 30:33.047
Alright.

30:43.558 --> 30:45.560
My nephew thinks i need
a second opinion.

30:45.560 --> 30:48.563
He doesn't like
it that i'm going
back under the knife.

30:48.563 --> 30:50.064
Maybe there's
something to that.

30:50.565 --> 30:52.066
Another expert
heard from.

30:52.066 --> 30:54.068
Think on this,
burger boy,

30:54.068 --> 30:56.571
anthony is a
cunt hair away

30:56.571 --> 30:58.072
from owning all of
northern jersey.

30:58.072 --> 31:00.074
And i am
that cunt hair.

31:00.074 --> 31:03.077
So, maybe he
has something
else on his mind,

31:03.077 --> 31:05.580
besides my full, complete
and speedy recovery.

31:05.580 --> 31:07.582
Oh, junior,
all this cynicism...

31:07.582 --> 31:10.084
this can't be
good for you.

31:13.588 --> 31:14.088
Giorgio.

31:19.093 --> 31:20.094
You speak italian.

31:20.094 --> 31:21.596
Second generation.

31:21.596 --> 31:23.097
Really, ross?

31:23.097 --> 31:24.098
Rosetti.

31:24.599 --> 31:27.101
1, 000 years of
a proud name undone

31:27.101 --> 31:28.603
with one stroke of
a pen at ellis island.

31:29.103 --> 31:30.104
A paisan.

31:30.104 --> 31:31.606
And not fa
r from you either.

31:31.606 --> 31:32.607
New brunswick.

31:32.607 --> 31:33.608
Get out!

31:33.608 --> 31:34.609
Any success
i may have,

31:34.609 --> 31:36.110
i credit to the jersey
public schools.

31:36.110 --> 31:37.612
They were somethin
g in those days.

31:37.612 --> 31:38.613
Where did you
go to college?

31:38.613 --> 31:39.614
Rutgers.

31:39.614 --> 31:41.115
I went to
montclair state.

31:41.616 --> 31:42.617
Good school.

31:42.617 --> 31:43.618
What was
your major?

31:44.118 --> 31:45.620
Business
administration.

31:45.620 --> 31:47.622
To meadow soprano,

31:47.622 --> 31:50.124
a valuable addition to
the columbia community.

31:50.124 --> 31:51.626
Really?

31:51.626 --> 31:52.627
Absolutely.

31:53.127 --> 31:54.629
I don't know
her personally,

31:55.129 --> 31:56.631
but i've talked to
her professors.

31:56.631 --> 32:00.134
They say she's attentive,
inquiring, does all her work,

32:00.134 --> 32:01.636
and makes insightful
contributions

32:01.636 --> 32:03.137
to class discussions.

32:03.137 --> 32:04.639
I am so glad to
hear you say that.

32:05.139 --> 32:06.641
And here i was worried
about her adjusting.

32:06.641 --> 32:08.643
Let's not
tell her though.

32:08.643 --> 32:10.144
We don't want he
r overconfident.

32:10.144 --> 32:13.147
It seems like she
sleeps an awful lot.

32:13.147 --> 32:15.149
They all do.

32:39.674 --> 32:41.676
Tony, what the hell?

32:43.177 --> 32:44.679
You know, ang,

32:44.679 --> 32:47.181
driving over here,

32:47.181 --> 32:49.183
i was thinking about how
i was gonna handle this.

32:49.183 --> 32:51.686
I been working
on my anger lately.

32:51.686 --> 32:53.688
So, i figured it'd be good
if i could just quietly say

32:54.188 --> 32:58.693
any kind of problem you got,
financial or otherwise,

32:58.693 --> 33:00.695
you come
directly to me.

33:00.695 --> 33:03.197
Please, leave carmel
a the fuck out of it.

33:03.698 --> 33:05.199
Like that.

33:05.199 --> 33:06.200
Of course.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.702
Then i saw
the cadillac.

33:07.702 --> 33:10.204
The money
i give you...

33:10.204 --> 33:13.207
you're driving a
cadillac and you'r
e looking for more?

33:13.207 --> 33:15.209
Shot the whole plan.

33:23.718 --> 33:25.720
So, remember this...

33:25.720 --> 33:29.223
you see my wife, you talk
about oven cleaner.

33:29.223 --> 33:31.225
Anything els
e you come to me,

33:31.225 --> 33:33.227
but think twic
e before you do.

33:33.227 --> 33:36.230
Think about that f
at fuck husband of yours

33:36.230 --> 33:37.732
and what h
e did to you.

33:37.732 --> 33:39.233
Him...

33:39.233 --> 33:40.234
not me.

33:42.236 --> 33:45.239
Coco, please,
coco, down!

33:45.239 --> 33:47.742
Hey, hey
, how are ya?

33:48.242 --> 33:49.744
I'm sorry, tony,
i'm sorry.

33:49.744 --> 33:50.745
Just push her away.

33:51.245 --> 33:52.246
No, she's alright.

33:52.246 --> 33:54.248
Good girl.

33:54.248 --> 33:56.250
Good girl.

33:56.250 --> 33:58.252
She don't
look sick.

33:58.252 --> 34:00.755
It comes and goes.

34:05.760 --> 34:08.262
So, your children don'
t feel boxed in by the city?

34:08.262 --> 34:09.764
We're out
all the time.

34:09.764 --> 34:12.266
Lately, felicia has us all
into kayaking on the hudson.

34:12.266 --> 34:13.768
You all do
it together?

34:13.768 --> 34:15.770
Yeah, the kids
love it too.

34:15.770 --> 34:17.271
They're already
better at it than i am.

34:17.271 --> 34:19.273
More wine?

34:19.774 --> 34:20.775
Why not?

34:20.775 --> 34:22.275
Remember i told you
i spend about half my time

34:22.275 --> 34:23.777
involved in
student affairs?

34:24.277 --> 34:27.281
Well, this is how
i spend the other half.

34:27.281 --> 34:28.783
Taking parents
to lunch?

34:28.783 --> 34:30.284
Development.

34:31.284 --> 34:33.788
A fancy word
for fund- raising.

34:34.789 --> 34:35.790
The new student center.

34:36.290 --> 34:37.291
We break ground
next fall.

34:37.291 --> 34:39.793
See the large
black marble wall

34:39.793 --> 34:41.295
to the right
of the entrance?

34:41.295 --> 34:42.295
Ah, yes.

34:42.797 --> 34:44.799
That's where the donor
names will be inscribed.

34:44.799 --> 34:46.801
Everybody who donates
gets their name up there?

34:46.801 --> 34:48.803
The wall is reserved for
people whose commitment

34:49.303 --> 34:50.804
begins at the
$50, 000 level.

34:50.804 --> 34:52.306
50, 000?

34:52.806 --> 34:55.309
It's what the giving
committee felt you'd
be comfortable with.

34:55.309 --> 34:58.813
Based on your past generosity
to the verbum dei school.

34:59.313 --> 35:00.815
You know what we
gave to verbum dei?

35:00.815 --> 35:04.819
I'm half embarrassed
to say it, but it's
my job to know.

35:04.819 --> 35:09.323
All the information including
tax benefits is in here.

35:11.325 --> 35:14.328
Well, i will have
to talk to my husband.

35:14.328 --> 35:15.830
50 grand?

35:16.330 --> 35:17.832
You gotta
be kidding me.

35:18.332 --> 35:20.334
He talked an awful lot
about meadow's having

35:20.334 --> 35:22.336
the best possible
university experience.

35:22.336 --> 35:24.338
Yeah, those jew pricks
are holding her hostage.

35:24.338 --> 35:25.339
He's italian.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.842
Jews with
better food.

35:27.842 --> 35:29.844
They know from verbum
we're big givers.

35:29.844 --> 35:32.346
We gave five
grand a year.

35:32.847 --> 35:34.348
That's a long
way from 50.

35:34.348 --> 35:36.350
This is college,
tony, new york city.

35:36.350 --> 35:38.853
5, 000 is a slap in
the face to these people.

35:38.853 --> 35:40.354
Well, let
'em say no.

35:49.363 --> 35:50.364
Here...

35:52.366 --> 35:53.868
it's around
five grand.

35:53.868 --> 35:56.370
Run it through you
r household account

35:56.871 --> 35:58.372
so, you can
write him a check.

35:58.372 --> 35:59.373
And that's it.

35:59.373 --> 36:01.375
Not a penny more.

36:06.881 --> 36:10.384
A five- f. U. Based regimen with
cisplatin and doxorubicin.

36:10.384 --> 36:12.386
This is the treatment
i would recommend.

36:12.386 --> 36:13.888
Are you
getting this?

36:16.390 --> 36:17.892
Sort of.

36:17.892 --> 36:21.395
So, the chemotherapy
would be instead of
the surgery?

36:21.896 --> 36:23.397
But i can't
guarantee
even that.

36:23.397 --> 36:25.900
We'll have to
evaluate the results
of the treatment.

36:25.900 --> 36:27.902
I could end up
having the chemo,

36:27.902 --> 36:29.904
puking my guts out,

36:29.904 --> 36:32.406
having the six hairs
i have left fall out...

36:32.406 --> 36:33.908
and still have to
be cut again.

36:34.408 --> 36:35.910
I'm afraid that's
a possibility.

36:35.910 --> 36:38.913
You see, with kennedy you
don't get these "maybes"
and "possibilities".

36:38.913 --> 36:40.414
Yeah, but you gott
a have the surgery again.

36:40.414 --> 36:41.916
Dr. Kennedy is an
excellent surgeon.

36:41.916 --> 36:44.418
Isn't there some
way you people
could just agree?

36:44.418 --> 36:44.919
Sure.

36:45.419 --> 36:46.420
Convene a tumor board.

36:46.420 --> 36:47.421
What the hell
is that?

36:47.421 --> 36:49.423
A meeting of the
chief of oncology,

36:49.423 --> 36:51.425
an oncological
pathologist,

36:51.425 --> 36:53.928
and other specialists
who then work together

36:53.928 --> 36:55.429
to reach a consensus.

36:55.429 --> 36:58.432
Then i guess you hea
r what they have to say?

36:58.933 --> 37:00.434
Well, your uncle
will not be present.

37:00.434 --> 37:02.436
They will pass their decision
along to both of you.

37:02.436 --> 37:05.940
What you do then is
still your decision.

37:05.940 --> 37:07.441
And kennedy
will be there?

37:07.441 --> 37:09.944
I assure you,
no surgeon
would miss it.

37:09.944 --> 37:11.445
Not much to him,
if you ask me.

37:11.946 --> 37:15.449
What, you mean
he's not kennedy?

37:15.449 --> 37:17.451
You make life
and death decisions

37:17.451 --> 37:19.453
because of a
man's name.

37:20.955 --> 37:22.456
It's only sloan
fuckin' kettering,

37:22.456 --> 37:24.458
the best cancer hospital
in the whole world.

37:25.459 --> 37:27.461
Excuse me.

37:33.968 --> 37:37.471
And let me ask you
something about this
jfk worship of yours,

37:37.471 --> 37:39.974
what about hoffa
and the teamsters?

37:40.474 --> 37:43.477
That was
the brother.

37:44.979 --> 37:45.980
Oh.

37:54.488 --> 37:55.489
Dr. Krakower?

37:55.489 --> 37:57.491
Hi, yes, thanks
for calling me back.

37:57.992 --> 38:00.494
I was referred by
a dr. Jennifer melfi.

38:00.995 --> 38:02.496
Yes, i would.

38:02.997 --> 38:04.999
Any time that's
good for you.

38:04.999 --> 38:07.001
That's gre
at, that's fine.

38:07.001 --> 38:08.502
Grove avenue, right.

38:08.502 --> 38:10.504
Okay, i gotta
go, bye bye.

38:12.506 --> 38:14.008
Who was that?

38:14.008 --> 38:16.010
It's the paving guy.

38:16.010 --> 38:17.511
I'm thinking of having
the driveway redone.

38:17.511 --> 38:20.014
You smoking?

38:20.014 --> 38:21.515
What is this,
the third degree?

38:22.516 --> 38:24.018
This says
with pulp.

38:24.518 --> 38:26.520
You like it
with pulp.

38:27.021 --> 38:30.524
Not this much, i like
the one that says some pulp.

38:33.527 --> 38:34.528
What the fuck
was that for?

38:35.029 --> 38:36.530
I'll write
you up a list.

38:45.039 --> 38:48.042
Oh, honey, i
missed you so much.

38:51.045 --> 38:53.047
You know, i figured ou
t that this is the longest

38:53.047 --> 38:54.548
we have ever been
away from each other.

38:54.548 --> 38:56.050
Did you miss me?

38:56.050 --> 38:57.051
Sure.

38:57.051 --> 39:00.054
Somebody drop this?

39:02.556 --> 39:04.558
Well, ho
w was it?

39:04.558 --> 39:07.061
It was pretty good.

39:07.061 --> 39:09.063
They had playstation two
right in the hotel room.

39:09.063 --> 39:10.564
And?

39:13.567 --> 39:17.071
That was the sum
total of your trip t
o your nation's capital?

39:17.071 --> 39:18.572
I guess.

39:26.580 --> 39:28.082
Alrigh
t, i'm sorry.

39:28.082 --> 39:29.583
The orange
juice is fine.

39:29.583 --> 39:31.085
Whatever kind you
wanna get is fine.

39:31.085 --> 39:32.586
Fuck the orange juice.

39:34.588 --> 39:36.590
Alright, i give
up, what then?

39:36.590 --> 39:39.093
All the money you give
to angie bonpensiero

39:39.093 --> 39:43.097
and who knows what
other widows you've
got on your payroll.

39:43.097 --> 39:44.598
It's a business
expense.

39:44.598 --> 39:46.600
But there's not
enough to make sure
your own daughter

39:46.600 --> 39:48.102
is protected?

39:48.102 --> 39:49.603
I won't pay.

39:50.104 --> 39:52.606
I know too muc
h about extortion.

39:56.610 --> 39:58.612
Big deal, he
pat you down.

39:58.612 --> 40:01.115
Pat me down i can do
standing on my head.

40:01.115 --> 40:02.616
It's every
fucking thing else.

40:02.616 --> 40:05.119
He came into my apartment
in the middle of the night

40:05.119 --> 40:07.121
and embarrassed
the shit out of me
in front of adriana.

40:07.621 --> 40:09.123
Yeah, i heard he
strip searched you.

40:09.123 --> 40:11.625
I'm not fuckin
g kidding, tony.

40:11.625 --> 40:13.627
He's a sick fuck!

40:14.128 --> 40:16.130
He was sniffin
g her fucking panties.

40:16.130 --> 40:17.631
What?

40:17.631 --> 40:19.133
You heardme.

40:22.136 --> 40:24.638
Look, i don't deny that
paulie could be a little...

40:24.638 --> 40:26.640
quirky.

40:26.640 --> 40:28.142
He always has.

40:29.643 --> 40:31.645
Christopher, you're
moving up very fast.

40:31.645 --> 40:33.147
Why do you
think that is?

40:33.647 --> 40:35.149
Are you gonna say
it's'cause i'm
your fucking nephew?

40:35.149 --> 40:37.651
So, be a big boy
and suck it up.

40:42.656 --> 40:44.158
The patient,
soprano comma corrado,

40:44.158 --> 40:46.160
male, caucasian,
72- years- old.

40:46.660 --> 40:49.163
Presented three months ago
with severe weight loss

40:49.163 --> 40:50.664
and early satiety.

40:50.664 --> 40:52.666
He was scoped and
a four millimeter mass

40:52.666 --> 40:55.169
in the greater curvature
of his stomach was detected.

40:55.169 --> 40:58.172
A ct scan revealed no
evidence of metastasis.

40:58.172 --> 41:00.674
Dr. Kennedy
was referred in

41:01.175 --> 41:03.677
and he recommended
gastric resection for cure.

41:03.677 --> 41:05.179
There were
no surprises.

41:05.179 --> 41:06.180
I thought
we had it.

41:06.180 --> 41:08.182
I was told we had
clean margins.

41:08.182 --> 41:11.185
Often, too little
healthy tissue

41:11.185 --> 41:12.686
was taken from
around the tumor site.

41:12.686 --> 41:15.689
Which leaves the
possibility, a
s in this case,

41:15.689 --> 41:17.191
for a false negative.

41:17.191 --> 41:18.692
You want the man's
whole stomach?

41:18.692 --> 41:20.194
If there's a problem
with the procedure,

41:20.194 --> 41:21.695
we'll take it up
on a board level.

41:21.695 --> 41:23.697
Meanwhile, what are we
gonna do with this guy?

41:23.697 --> 41:25.199
He's high risk.

41:25.199 --> 41:27.701
His pressure fell below 60
systolic for eight minutes

41:27.701 --> 41:28.702
on the table.

41:29.203 --> 41:30.204
The incision's
still fresh.

41:30.204 --> 41:31.205
I can do it in
half the time.

41:31.205 --> 41:33.207
If we don't do surgery,
we do 5- f. U.

41:33.707 --> 41:35.709
Which works how well
on an adenocarcinoma?

41:35.709 --> 41:37.211
Not very.

41:37.211 --> 41:39.713
Which is why we decided
to go in, in the first place.

41:40.214 --> 41:42.216
So, what do
i tell mehta?

41:42.216 --> 41:43.717
Mehta?

41:43.717 --> 41:45.219
Sloan- kettering mehta?

41:45.219 --> 41:47.721
Your patient sought
a second opinion
with dr. Mehta.

41:47.721 --> 41:49.723
Forget it then.

41:49.723 --> 41:51.725
The last thing i
need is to operate

41:51.725 --> 41:53.727
with that little shit
looking over my shoulder.

41:55.729 --> 41:57.231
I'll tell him.

41:57.231 --> 42:00.234
Yes, i'll have
him there, thanks.

42:02.736 --> 42:05.239
Don't sugarcoat it.

42:06.740 --> 42:07.741
If you concentrate
on your breathing,

42:08.242 --> 42:09.243
it'll be easier
all around.

42:09.243 --> 42:11.745
The girl said she'd
page dr. Kennedy.

42:11.745 --> 42:13.747
Where the fuck
is he?

42:13.747 --> 42:16.750
Alright, 20 minutes
and i'll be back.

42:25.259 --> 42:27.261
You go too
easy on him.

42:27.261 --> 42:28.762
Probably.

42:28.762 --> 42:32.266
Hey, if my nephew
cubby wasn't dead,

42:32.266 --> 42:35.269
i'd have a soft
spot for him.

42:36.770 --> 42:38.272
Did you sniff that
girl's panties?

42:38.772 --> 42:40.274
He told you that?

42:40.274 --> 42:42.276
Fucking baby!

42:42.776 --> 42:44.778
You got
to apologize.

42:44.778 --> 42:47.281
T, i'm not
apologizing to him.

42:47.281 --> 42:48.782
You were
out of line.

42:48.782 --> 42:50.284
He's gonna marry t
he girl, for chrissakes.

42:50.784 --> 42:52.286
As of the
wedding day,

42:52.286 --> 42:56.290
anything that touches
her pussy is off limits.

43:03.297 --> 43:05.799
You think
it's all up?

43:08.302 --> 43:11.305
Soon enough there'll
be more where
that came from.

43:14.308 --> 43:17.311
Sounds like you were going
at it pretty good in there.

43:17.311 --> 43:19.313
My pain a source of
entertainment to you?

43:20.314 --> 43:22.316
You see me laughing?

43:22.316 --> 43:24.818
I brought you
a milk shake fro
m "31 flavors".

43:26.820 --> 43:28.822
It's all your
fucking fault anyway.

43:29.323 --> 43:32.326
I'm throwing up day and night
since i started the chemo.

43:32.326 --> 43:33.327
Oh, right.

43:33.327 --> 43:35.329
I gave you cancer.

43:35.329 --> 43:37.831
You don't know what
this is like, anthony.

43:37.831 --> 43:40.334
I can't do it.

43:40.334 --> 43:42.836
Kennedy was right.

43:42.836 --> 43:44.338
What's he
got to say?

43:44.838 --> 43:46.840
I can't get him
on the phone.

43:46.840 --> 43:48.342
The nurses won't put
me through to him.

43:48.342 --> 43:49.843
Why not?

43:49.843 --> 43:52.846
I leave messages
at the hospital,
at the office.

43:52.846 --> 43:54.848
I sent him
a box of cohibas.

43:54.848 --> 43:56.850
I couldn't get
past reception.

43:56.850 --> 43:58.852
He didn't
call you back?

43:58.852 --> 44:00.354
Who knows if they
even tell him?

44:00.354 --> 44:01.855
Last night the
machine says,

44:01.855 --> 44:03.357
"if it's an emergency,
press six."

44:03.357 --> 44:04.858
So, i press six.

44:04.858 --> 44:07.361
Still no call back,
24 hours later.

44:07.361 --> 44:09.363
He must be
very busy.

44:09.363 --> 44:12.366
Yeah, that must be it.

44:15.869 --> 44:17.371
You go
t his number?

44:22.376 --> 44:25.379
Three more weeks.

44:25.379 --> 44:27.881
Three more
fuckin' weeks.

44:32.886 --> 44:34.888
His fuckin'
answerin' machine.

44:35.389 --> 44:36.890
What are ya
gonna do?

44:36.890 --> 44:38.892
These doctors,
it's not like on tv.

44:39.393 --> 44:41.395
Dr. Kennedy,
this is tony soprano,

44:41.395 --> 44:43.397
corrado soprano's nephew.

44:43.897 --> 44:48.402
My cell ph
one is 917- 555- 0157.

44:48.402 --> 44:51.405
Call me back any
time, day or night.

44:51.405 --> 44:53.907
It's important.

44:55.909 --> 44:57.911
Batter up.

45:06.920 --> 45:07.921
Bye.

45:31.445 --> 45:32.946
Now what?

45:32.946 --> 45:33.947
Get in.

45:41.955 --> 45:42.956
You're not even
married yet,

45:42.956 --> 45:44.958
you're dipping int
o whores already.

45:44.958 --> 45:46.960
Didn't cost
me a quarter.

45:47.461 --> 45:48.462
I don't
pay for it.

45:50.964 --> 45:52.966
How'd you find me?

45:52.966 --> 45:53.967
Better be careful.

45:54.468 --> 45:57.471
If i can do it, so
can your bride- to- be.

45:57.971 --> 45:58.972
So, what is this?

45:58.972 --> 46:00.974
Some new rule
about who i fuck?

46:00.974 --> 46:02.976
You want more
shoes, what?

46:02.976 --> 46:05.479
No, funny thing is
they don't even fit her.

46:05.479 --> 46:09.983
I don't know why i thought
she was a size 10.

46:09.983 --> 46:10.984
I don't know either.

46:10.984 --> 46:14.488
I'm here to tell
you one thing...

46:14.488 --> 46:16.490
you ever go whinin
g to the big man again

46:16.990 --> 46:18.492
about shit between
you and me,

46:18.492 --> 46:20.994
we'll have a problem,
my friend.

46:37.511 --> 46:39.012
You seen these?

46:40.514 --> 46:42.015
The fuck is that?

46:42.015 --> 46:43.517
My godson
got it for me.

46:43.517 --> 46:45.018
They're all ov
er the fuckin' place,

46:45.018 --> 46:48.522
we gotta bring one
into the club.

47:12.045 --> 47:13.547
Watch and learn, phil.

47:13.547 --> 47:15.048
Watch and learn.

47:25.058 --> 47:26.560
What are you doing?

47:27.060 --> 47:28.562
Hey, doc,
it's me, tony.

47:28.562 --> 47:30.063
Corrado soprano's
nephew.

47:30.063 --> 47:31.565
You belong to
this club?

47:31.565 --> 47:33.066
Me?
No, no, no.

47:33.567 --> 47:34.568
I came here
to see you.

47:34.568 --> 47:36.069
If it's about
your uncle,

47:36.069 --> 47:37.571
you'll have to
call my office.

47:38.071 --> 47:39.072
You might need
a new secretary,

47:39.573 --> 47:41.575
i don't think
you're getting
all your messages.

47:43.577 --> 47:45.078
For you...

47:45.078 --> 47:47.080
titanium.

47:47.080 --> 47:50.584
I use one, added 1
0 yards to my drives.

47:50.584 --> 47:53.086
Thanks, but i really
can't accept it.

47:53.086 --> 47:56.089
For everything you'v
e done for my uncle.

47:56.089 --> 47:58.091
Anyway, what a
m i gonna do with it?

47:58.592 --> 48:00.093
I've already got one
and mr. Williams here...

48:00.093 --> 48:01.595
he don't play.

48:01.595 --> 48:03.096
Right?

48:03.096 --> 48:05.599
Stupid fucking game.

48:06.600 --> 48:08.101
What can i do
with it?

48:08.101 --> 48:09.102
What is it, jack?

48:09.102 --> 48:11.104
He'll just
be a minute.

48:16.610 --> 48:19.112
Well, i could use a
little extra distance.

48:19.112 --> 48:20.113
Who couldn't?

48:20.113 --> 48:24.117
You know, my uncle, he's
not doing so well.

48:24.117 --> 48:26.119
He's got a bad reaction
to that chemo.

48:26.119 --> 48:27.621
That happens
all the time,

48:27.621 --> 48:30.123
there's nothing
that i can
really do.

48:30.123 --> 48:32.125
You know, there
are worse things

48:32.125 --> 48:34.628
that can happen to
a person than cancer.

48:34.628 --> 48:36.129
My uncle think
s he's gonna die.

48:36.129 --> 48:37.631
He's convinced ofit.

48:37.631 --> 48:40.133
You know how old people
are with their superstitions.

48:40.634 --> 48:44.638
He thinks it's'ca
use he went against you.

48:52.646 --> 48:55.649
I was his surgeon,
that's all.

48:57.150 --> 48:58.151
You got a bee
on you hat.

49:00.153 --> 49:04.157
Show that man the
respect he deserves.

49:06.159 --> 49:08.662
Answer his
phone calls.

49:19.673 --> 49:22.175
Cheryl, make sure
mr. Soprano is
scheduled for--

49:22.676 --> 49:24.678
just rememberit.

49:37.190 --> 49:38.692
Everybody's marriage
has problems.

49:38.692 --> 49:40.193
Is he seeing
another woman?

49:40.193 --> 49:42.696
You can make
that plural.

49:42.696 --> 49:44.197
Yes, he sees
other women.

49:44.197 --> 49:45.699
I sort of lo
ok the other way.

49:46.199 --> 49:47.701
I want to help him.

49:47.701 --> 49:48.702
Do you?

49:49.202 --> 49:51.204
Moments ago you used
the word "divorce".

49:51.204 --> 49:53.707
I said i was
considering divorce.

49:56.209 --> 49:58.712
I may be overstepping
my boundaries here,

49:58.712 --> 50:01.214
but you are jewish,
aren't you?

50:01.214 --> 50:02.215
Is that relevant?

50:02.716 --> 50:04.718
Well, us catholics,

50:04.718 --> 50:08.722
we place a great deal of sto
in the sanctity of the family.

50:08.722 --> 50:11.725
And i'm not su
re that your people--

50:11.725 --> 50:15.228
i've been married
for 31 years.

50:15.228 --> 50:18.732
Then you know how
difficult it can be.

50:18.732 --> 50:21.234
He's a good man,

50:21.234 --> 50:22.235
he's a good father.

50:22.736 --> 50:25.739
You tell me he's a
depressed criminal.

50:25.739 --> 50:27.741
Prone to anger,

50:27.741 --> 50:29.743
serially unfaithful.

50:29.743 --> 50:33.747
Is that your definition
of a good man?

50:33.747 --> 50:36.750
I thought psychiatrists
weren't supposed
to be judgmental.

50:36.750 --> 50:40.253
Many patients want to
be excused for their
current predicament

50:40.253 --> 50:43.757
because of events
that occurred in
their childhood.

50:43.757 --> 50:45.759
That's what psychiatry
has become in america.

50:45.759 --> 50:50.263
Visit any shopping mall
or ethnic pride parade

50:50.263 --> 50:53.266
to witness
the results.

50:55.268 --> 50:58.772
What we say in here
stays in here, right?

50:58.772 --> 51:00.273
By ethical code
and by law.

51:00.273 --> 51:01.775
His crimes...

51:01.775 --> 51:04.277
they are...

51:05.779 --> 51:08.281
organized crime.

51:08.782 --> 51:09.783
The mafia?

51:09.783 --> 51:11.785
Oh, jesus.

51:15.789 --> 51:17.290
Oh, so what?

51:17.290 --> 51:18.792
So what?

51:18.792 --> 51:22.796
He betrays me every week
with these whores.

51:22.796 --> 51:25.799
Probably the least
of his misdeeds.

51:27.801 --> 51:29.302
You can
leave now,

51:29.302 --> 51:32.305
or you can stay and hear
what i have to say.

51:33.807 --> 51:37.310
You're gonna charge
the same anyway.

51:37.310 --> 51:38.812
I won't take
your money.

51:38.812 --> 51:40.313
That's a new one.

51:40.313 --> 51:41.815
You must trust
your initial impulse

51:41.815 --> 51:44.317
and consider
leaving him.

51:44.317 --> 51:47.320
You'll never be able to
feel good about yourself,

51:47.320 --> 51:50.824
never be able to quell
the feelings of
guilt and shame

51:51.324 --> 51:53.326
that you talk about...

51:53.326 --> 51:56.329
as long as you're
his accomplice.

51:56.329 --> 51:59.332
You're wrong about the
accomplice part though.

51:59.332 --> 52:01.334
Are you sure?

52:01.334 --> 52:02.836
All i do is make sure he's got
clean clothes in his closet,

52:03.336 --> 52:05.338
and dinner
on his table.

52:05.338 --> 52:07.841
So, enabler would be a more
accurate job description

52:07.841 --> 52:09.342
for you than
accomplice.

52:09.342 --> 52:11.845
My apologies.

52:13.847 --> 52:15.348
So...

52:15.348 --> 52:17.851
you think i need to...

52:17.851 --> 52:20.854
define my boundaries
more clearly,

52:20.854 --> 52:23.356
keep a certain
distance,

52:23.356 --> 52:25.358
not internalize my--

52:25.358 --> 52:28.361
what did
i just say?

52:30.363 --> 52:31.364
Leave him.

52:31.364 --> 52:32.866
Take only
the children.

52:32.866 --> 52:34.367
What's left of
them and go.

52:34.367 --> 52:37.370
My priest said i shoul
d try and work with him,

52:37.370 --> 52:38.872
help him to be
a better man.

52:38.872 --> 52:40.874
How's that going?

52:44.878 --> 52:46.379
I...

52:46.379 --> 52:49.382
have you ever read
"crime and punishment"?

52:49.382 --> 52:50.884
Dostoyevsky?

52:50.884 --> 52:52.886
It's not an
easy read.

52:52.886 --> 52:55.388
It's about guilt
and redemption

52:55.388 --> 52:58.391
and i think were
your husband to
turn himself in,

52:58.391 --> 53:00.894
read this book
and reflect on
his crimes

53:01.394 --> 53:02.896
every day for seven years

53:02.896 --> 53:04.397
in his cell,

53:04.898 --> 53:06.900
then he might
be redeemed.

53:06.900 --> 53:09.903
I would have to
get a lawyer,

53:09.903 --> 53:11.404
find an apartment.

53:11.404 --> 53:14.407
Arrange for
child support--

53:14.908 --> 53:15.909
you're not listening.

53:15.909 --> 53:20.914
I'm not charging you because
i won't take blood money.

53:20.914 --> 53:22.916
And you can't
either.

53:24.918 --> 53:26.920
One thing you
can never say...

53:26.920 --> 53:30.924
that you haven't
been told.

53:33.927 --> 53:35.428
I see.

53:35.428 --> 53:38.431
You're right,
i see.

53:41.935 --> 53:44.437
You're fucking
poisoning me.

53:44.437 --> 53:46.439
I don't know how much
more of this i can take.

53:46.439 --> 53:48.441
You taking
good care of
this young man?

53:48.441 --> 53:49.943
Jesus, dr. Kennedy.

53:49.943 --> 53:51.444
How you doing, guy?

53:51.945 --> 53:54.447
I been busy,
you alright?

53:54.447 --> 53:56.950
Doc, don't bullshit
a bullshitter.

53:56.950 --> 53:58.451
Is this shit
gonna work

53:58.451 --> 53:59.953
or should we go
back in the room?

54:00.453 --> 54:01.454
You got a
top guy here.

54:01.454 --> 54:02.455
Him?

54:02.455 --> 54:03.456
The guy i'd go see
if i needed to.

54:03.957 --> 54:05.458
I'll be a
sonofabitch.

54:05.458 --> 54:06.960
The important
thing is

54:06.960 --> 54:09.462
you stay strong an
d keep fighting, alright?

54:09.462 --> 54:10.463
That's m
y home number.

54:10.964 --> 54:13.466
You start to feel
punk, you call me.

54:13.466 --> 54:14.467
Thanks,
dr. Kennedy.

54:14.968 --> 54:15.969
I'll check back
on you wednesday.

54:16.469 --> 54:18.471
Take good care
of this young fella.

54:41.995 --> 54:43.496
Carm.

54:43.997 --> 54:44.497
What?

54:45.999 --> 54:48.501
You sick?

54:48.501 --> 54:51.504
Everybody else in this
family sleeps all day,

54:51.504 --> 54:53.506
i thought
i'd try it.

54:53.506 --> 54:55.008
You, uh...

54:55.008 --> 54:57.010
depressed...

54:57.010 --> 54:59.012
or what?

54:59.512 --> 55:02.015
I figure in the division
of labor around here,

55:02.015 --> 55:03.016
that's your job.

55:20.533 --> 55:22.535
'Cause if you want
to go to therapy

55:22.535 --> 55:25.538
on your own
or something...

55:28.541 --> 55:30.043
i've noticed you b
een a little tense lately.

55:30.543 --> 55:31.544
That's rich.

55:31.544 --> 55:35.048
You suggesting
i go to a shrink.

55:37.550 --> 55:39.552
I don't
have the time.

55:43.556 --> 55:45.558
I'll still go to
yours if you want.

55:49.062 --> 55:51.064
You know best.

55:51.064 --> 55:54.567
That dean
called today.

55:54.567 --> 55:57.070
Well, that
can't be good.

55:57.070 --> 55:59.572
I told him to put us
down for the 50, 000.

56:00.573 --> 56:03.576
Carmela, i
gave you five.

56:03.576 --> 56:05.078
Now...

56:05.078 --> 56:07.580
maybe i could go
another five, maybe 10,

56:07.580 --> 56:10.583
but that's enough.

56:12.585 --> 56:16.089
Tony, you gotta do
something nice for me today,

56:16.589 --> 56:19.092
this is
what i want.

56:19.092 --> 56:21.594
You gotta
do this.

56:21.594 --> 56:23.096
Alright,
i'll go to 10.

56:23.596 --> 56:27.100
That should be enough
for those morningside
heights gangsters.

56:27.100 --> 56:29.102
I already
told him 50.

56:40.613 --> 56:41.614
50 g's.

56:42.115 --> 56:43.616
Yes.

56:59.132 --> 57:02.135
You look like you could use
a night off from cookin'.

57:02.635 --> 57:05.138
What do you say
we go out?
