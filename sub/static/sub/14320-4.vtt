NARRATOR:
Previously onX-Men...

00:03.625 --> 00:06.000
LILANDRA: Help me,
Charles Xavier.
Help me.

00:09.291 --> 00:11.500
They're coming!

00:11.500 --> 00:15.125
XAVIER: The space shuttle
Starcore is scheduled for
launch tomorrow.

00:15.125 --> 00:18.625
You must find a way
to get aboard that
shuttle.

00:18.625 --> 00:21.250
And go to the Eagle One
space station.

00:21.250 --> 00:26.000
All I can tell
you is that an event
of immense importance

00:26.000 --> 00:29.375
is about
to occur in space.
You must be ready.

00:29.375 --> 00:32.291
CORBEAU: Docking
sequence initiated.

00:32.291 --> 00:34.291
-What is it, Jean?
-I don't know.

00:34.291 --> 00:36.708
A trap! Quickly!
Back to the shuttle!

00:36.708 --> 00:37.958
(GROANS)

00:39.583 --> 00:43.166
My purpose
here is to intercept
an enemy of my emperor,

00:43.166 --> 00:44.875
the rebel Lilandra.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.416
Agent!
Has Lilandra's
ship been stopped?

00:53.416 --> 00:55.333
Not as yet, Excellency.

00:55.333 --> 00:58.000
But her agents
will soon be
destroyed.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.166
Back to the shuttle!
It's our only chance!

01:02.083 --> 01:04.458
CORBEAU: We're going to
fly right through the
energy contrail!

01:04.458 --> 01:08.458
Look like there gonna be
a barbecue and we gonna
be the main course.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.250
(GROANING)

02:24.166 --> 02:26.833

02:42.125 --> 02:45.458

I must...

its watertight integrity.

(GRUNTING)

03:55.500 --> 03:57.000

04:35.291 --> 04:36.375
Jean!

04:43.333 --> 04:47.958
I am Phoenix!

04:47.958 --> 04:49.500
Fascinating.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.375
JEAN: Help me.

04:54.375 --> 04:55.625

05:03.833 --> 05:05.500
Jean! Jean!

05:08.708 --> 05:11.000
FEMALE NEWSCASTER:
And the investigation
continues

05:11.000 --> 05:13.291
on what went wrong
with the shuttle's
flight plan--

05:13.291 --> 05:15.208
CYCLOPS:
I thought
we'd lost you.

05:15.208 --> 05:17.750
Then you rose up
out of the water.

05:17.750 --> 05:21.166
You said something,
and then you lost
consciousness.

05:21.166 --> 05:23.750
I don't remember.

05:23.750 --> 05:26.958
How did I survive?
Did I survive?

05:26.958 --> 05:28.833
You're here,
aren't you?

05:28.833 --> 05:34.000
Yes,
but I feel strange,
like I'm someone else.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.333
Like I could reach out
and touch the moon
and crush it in my hand.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.958
Jean,
who is Phoenix?

05:41.958 --> 05:46.750
Phoenix?
Am I Phoenix?

05:46.750 --> 05:51.208
You claimed her identity once
before, Jean, when you rose
not from the ashes,

05:51.208 --> 05:52.708
but from
the depths of
New York Harbor.

05:52.708 --> 05:53.875
I flew?

05:53.875 --> 05:56.291
XAVIER: Yes, Jean.

05:56.291 --> 06:00.208
Some sort of transformation
has taken place that none
of us yet understands.

06:00.208 --> 06:02.333
Until we know
what has happened,

06:02.333 --> 06:05.458
it will be best that you
do not leave the hospital.

06:13.833 --> 06:16.291
I spoke privately
with Dr. Corbeau.

06:16.291 --> 06:19.250
He informed me that NASA
cannot explain the existence

06:19.250 --> 06:23.166
of the alien spacecraft
or the strange readings
we registered

06:23.166 --> 06:25.833
or,
for that matter,
how we survived.

06:25.833 --> 06:28.875
All is being denied to
prevent a public panic.

06:28.875 --> 06:31.083
He also said a number
of governments are
concerned

06:31.083 --> 06:33.750
over new activity
within the vortex.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.458
Another
alien ship
coming through?

06:35.458 --> 06:37.875
So it seems.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.375
It's time you told us
everything you know,
Professor.

06:40.375 --> 06:43.833
I've told you all I can.

06:43.833 --> 06:45.875
All that makes any sense.

06:45.875 --> 06:47.708
That's not good enough!

06:47.708 --> 06:50.000
Jean's lying in there
because you sent us
in blind

06:50.000 --> 06:51.958
against something that
almost destroyed us!

06:51.958 --> 06:53.708
Because you
failed to warn us!

06:53.708 --> 06:55.625
You had all
the information
then available.

06:55.625 --> 06:58.333
A good leader doesn't
have to be warned to
be on his guard!

06:58.333 --> 07:00.583
Are you saying it's my fault
what happened to Jean?

07:00.583 --> 07:02.708
If I might interject.

07:02.708 --> 07:06.375
Concern over Jean's condition
has rendered both of you
irrational.

07:06.375 --> 07:10.375
Neither preparation
nor leadership could have
prevented what occurred.

07:10.375 --> 07:12.583
And now,
if you will excuse me,

07:14.208 --> 07:17.083
I'm eager to examine
the mind-control
implants

07:17.083 --> 07:19.250
removed from the
space station
astronauts.

07:23.333 --> 07:24.875
Fascinating.

(CLATTERING)

07:35.875 --> 07:37.875

07:46.875 --> 07:49.458
I share your concern,
Wolverine.

07:49.458 --> 07:51.958
Jean seems to be
feeling much better.

07:51.958 --> 07:53.583
Why don't you go
see for yourself?

07:53.583 --> 07:55.875
Maybe I don't like hospitals.

07:55.875 --> 08:01.708
Last time I was
on an operating table,
it didn't turn out so well.

08:01.708 --> 08:04.208
Science can wait.

08:04.208 --> 08:08.208
Perhaps a sojourn
to a Manhattan nightspot
might help clear your mind.

08:08.208 --> 08:09.958
Maybe.

08:09.958 --> 08:11.875

always so difficult to
get a cab in New York?

08:23.875 --> 08:26.625
Thanks, Hank.
I think I'll just
spend some time alone.

What are you
trying to tell me?

09:05.458 --> 09:09.000

Must keep control.

affecting you.

15:13.583 --> 15:15.250

a psychic projection
from the Professor's mind.

-But why?
-Something's wrong.

be out of control.

you can reach him, Jean,
while I contact the X-Men.

Professor?

15:44.708 --> 15:46.000
It was here.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.708
What was here,
Professor?

15:47.708 --> 15:49.416
I don't know.

15:49.416 --> 15:53.458
I felt a psychic probe
of enormous power.

15:53.458 --> 15:55.833
The same one that
has been haunting me,

15:55.833 --> 15:59.250
that warned me of the trouble
aboard the space station.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.583
Only this time
it dug deeper.

16:01.583 --> 16:04.958
The probe overwhelmed
all of the safeguards

16:04.958 --> 16:08.208
I have built to control
the surging powers of
my mind,

16:08.208 --> 16:10.333
including the dark side,

16:10.333 --> 16:13.500
the destructive urges
that live within us all.

16:13.500 --> 16:16.583
With the shroud that
conceals it ripped away,

16:16.583 --> 16:21.583
that dark side
of my nature lashed out,
without reason or compassion,

16:21.583 --> 16:27.708
trying to
destroy what I care
about the most, the X-Men.

16:27.708 --> 16:29.583
Xavier is the key.

16:29.583 --> 16:31.375
We shall be ready.

16:37.708 --> 16:43.750
Until I regain
+control of my subconscious,
my orders cannot be trusted.

be in command of
the X-Men until I return.

Moira's told me
a great deal about you,
Mr. Xavier.

17:15.250 --> 17:18.000
How fortunate.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.125
Now if you'll
show me my quarters,
Moira, I need to rest.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.875
I've not seen him
like this, Sean.

17:24.875 --> 17:27.208
It may be even worse
than he told me.

17:32.708 --> 17:35.208
Are you out there?

17:35.208 --> 17:40.833
I fear you, yet I sense
you may be the answer
to my loneliness.

17:41.875 --> 17:44.083
Does he not still
love you, Moira?

17:44.083 --> 17:47.291
I dunnae think so,
but he needs me.

17:47.291 --> 17:51.250
Charles has given everything
for his students, his X-Men.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.833
But friends, aye,
that's different.

17:53.833 --> 17:57.083
Sometimes I think
I'm the only one he has.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.833
(SCREAMING)

18:08.416 --> 18:11.958
You are driving me insane!

18:14.500 --> 18:17.166
But I must not fight you.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.708
Who are you?

18:32.750 --> 18:35.583
My name is Lilandra.

18:36.583 --> 18:40.250
I come from a world unknown
to you. A world called Shi'ar.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.875
Why have you come
here, to the Earth?

18:42.875 --> 18:45.458
Charles Xavier.
Let me show you.

18:47.125 --> 18:50.291
I am the sister of D'Ken,
the emperor of the Shi'ar.

18:50.291 --> 18:53.208
I served my brother loyally,

18:53.208 --> 18:55.083
until I learned that
he sought to control

18:55.083 --> 18:57.375
the greatest
power in the universe,

18:57.375 --> 19:01.416
the ancient
Crystal of M'Kraan.
Immeasurably powerful.

19:02.708 --> 19:05.500
My brother
hopes to harness
the crystal's power

19:05.500 --> 19:07.625
to use it as a weapon.

19:07.625 --> 19:09.375
My brother is mad.

19:10.375 --> 19:12.583
It is written that
if the crystal is
breached,

19:12.583 --> 19:15.125
both of our galaxies
could be at risk.

19:18.833 --> 19:20.125
(SCREECHING)

19:30.458 --> 19:32.583
To keep the crystal
from my brother,

19:32.583 --> 19:35.250
I violated its
ancient sanctuary,

19:35.250 --> 19:37.833
the most sacred temple
of Shi'ar.

19:38.833 --> 19:41.000
I stole the M'Kraan Crystal.

19:44.833 --> 19:47.416
I escaped aboard
a star cruiser,

19:47.416 --> 19:50.833
but my brother pursued me,
with the warships
of the Imperial fleet.

19:50.833 --> 19:54.000
They attempted to destroy
me and my ship
to get the crystal.

19:56.833 --> 19:59.125
I managed to reach
your solar system.

19:59.125 --> 20:01.458
But D'Ken will
follow me here,
in time.

20:03.458 --> 20:06.166
That is why you must help me.

20:06.166 --> 20:09.166
What led you here, to me?

20:09.166 --> 20:11.875
The Shi'ar
believe that two
minds can be linked

20:11.875 --> 20:14.583
from the moment
of their creation,

20:14.583 --> 20:17.458
destined to
seek each other out
in their time of need.

20:17.458 --> 20:21.416
It's a bond like
love, only deeper.

20:21.416 --> 20:23.291
Do you also
believe this?

20:23.291 --> 20:25.125
I do now.

20:25.125 --> 20:28.458
I have seen your face
a thousand times,
in my mind.

20:28.458 --> 20:29.583
(DOOR ALARM BEEPING)

20:29.583 --> 20:31.291
It's all right,
Moira.

20:33.416 --> 20:37.250
The name's Juggernaut,
dear brother!

20:37.250 --> 20:38.833
(GROANING)

20:38.833 --> 20:41.875
And you must be Lilandra!

20:41.875 --> 20:43.333
(LAUGHING)
