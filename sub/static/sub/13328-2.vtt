00:27.500 --> 00:29.542
( blows whistle )

00:54.834 --> 00:57.166
Good news, man.
Got some groceries.

00:57.166 --> 01:00.291
- Really?
- Yeah, I got some good stuff.

01:01.125 --> 01:02.542
Think you'll
like that.

01:02.542 --> 01:04.917
- A sandwich?
- Yeah.

01:04.917 --> 01:07.917
That looks good.

01:07.917 --> 01:10.125
- Some jam looks good.
- Mmm.

01:10.125 --> 01:12.500
That looks quite
good as well.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.625
This is great.
How did you afford this?

01:14.625 --> 01:16.917
Um, oh it was free.

01:16.917 --> 01:19.166
- Free?
- Yeah.

01:20.708 --> 01:23.125
- How come it was free?
- Eh?

01:23.125 --> 01:24.667
I found it.

01:24.667 --> 01:28.166
It was on the street.
Someone didn't want it.

01:31.750 --> 01:34.333
What are you doing, man?
That's a good sandwich.

01:34.333 --> 01:37.166
I was gonna spit it out,
but I think I'll just eat it.

01:37.166 --> 01:39.667
We're poor, man.

- Murray.
- Oh, guys.

04:16.959 --> 04:20.250
What are you doing here?
This is not a scheduled
band meeting.

04:20.250 --> 04:21.375
Are you busy?

04:21.375 --> 04:23.875
I'm just reading about
the old toothbrush fence.

04:23.875 --> 04:26.333
50 brushes now.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.917
Pretty impressive, huh?

04:29.917 --> 04:32.083
Murray,
we need some money.

04:32.083 --> 04:34.750
Okay.
How much?

04:34.750 --> 04:37.333
I got about
$4 in here.

04:37.333 --> 04:39.208
$4?
I thought we had $10?

04:39.208 --> 04:40.750
This box cost $6.

04:40.750 --> 04:43.041
- What was wrong with the bag?
- The bag was useless, Bret.

04:43.041 --> 04:44.583
It had a great
big hole in it.

04:44.583 --> 04:47.000
Must have lost about
$20 out of that bag.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.834
It's the box now.

04:48.834 --> 04:51.041
Do you like it?
I chose it.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.750
Well, can we have
the $4?

04:52.750 --> 04:55.083
Well, there'll be
nothing in the box.

04:55.083 --> 04:59.125
Here's the $4.
I got 27¢ here.

04:59.125 --> 05:00.583
Yeah.

05:00.583 --> 05:02.208
That's it.
That's the lot of it.

05:02.208 --> 05:04.291
Actually, I'm owed
12% of that.

05:04.291 --> 05:06.834
Hang on,
let's have a look.

05:09.083 --> 05:11.500
Okay, 51.24 cents.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.166
- We can't even divide--
- Just leave it.

05:13.166 --> 05:14.625
- You take it all.
- Maybe a quarter.

05:14.625 --> 05:16.166
Look, I tell you what,
I feel bad.

05:16.166 --> 05:19.125
I haven't got you
paid gigs for a while.
Here you go.

05:19.125 --> 05:20.792
Take this.

05:20.792 --> 05:22.667
$50.

05:22.667 --> 05:24.375
You can't give us
your own money.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.125
Well, yeah, you're right.
It is my last $50.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.208
Till Thursday, I mean,
you know.

05:28.208 --> 05:31.166
- Getting paid again, but...
- Have we sold any t-shirts?

05:31.166 --> 05:33.041
- Two.
- What about mousepads?

05:33.041 --> 05:34.792
- No.
- Haven't sold any mousepads?

05:34.792 --> 05:36.417
I told you--
terrible idea.

05:36.417 --> 05:38.166
I don't know what
to do with them.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.166
I've got so many
mousepads at home because
of your bad idea, Bret.

05:40.166 --> 05:41.875
What do you do
with mousepads?

05:41.875 --> 05:44.667
I've lined Toby's
kennel with them.
He keeps eating them.

05:44.667 --> 05:46.875
I tried to waterproof
the kitchen.

05:46.875 --> 05:48.875
Well, we need
some cash.

05:48.875 --> 05:50.750
Maybe you guys should
think about supplementing
your band income

05:50.750 --> 05:53.708
by getting another job,
like I do with this job.

05:53.708 --> 05:56.041
Murray, the prime
minister's office

05:56.041 --> 05:58.625
wants to talk to you
about the World Trade
Expo next week.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.083
Can you tell them I'll
ring them straight back?

06:00.083 --> 06:01.917
I've just got a couple
of businessmen here.

06:01.917 --> 06:04.458
Everybody knows you
manage a band during
office hours, Murray.

06:04.458 --> 06:06.667
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Greg.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.750
I wear that t-shirt
all the time.

06:08.750 --> 06:12.500
Greg, we've still got
mousepads, actually.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.000
No thanks, Murray.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.792
See? Hopeless.

06:19.667 --> 06:23.291
The job is you have to
hold up this sign

06:23.291 --> 06:25.291
and you have to make sure

06:25.291 --> 06:27.500
it points in
the right direction.

06:27.500 --> 06:31.333
Now, does that sound like
something you can do?

06:31.333 --> 06:34.792
Sounds like something
a lamppost could do.

06:34.792 --> 06:36.333
- That's all.
- You know what?

06:36.333 --> 06:39.542
You're sign material.
This guy overthinks things.

06:39.542 --> 06:42.375
Okay? You can't
overthink in this business.

06:42.375 --> 06:43.792
You cannot.

06:43.792 --> 06:45.291
What if a wind comes

06:45.291 --> 06:48.125
and blows it away?
You ever think of that,

06:48.125 --> 06:50.000
Enrico Ferme?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Oh, we can hold it.
It won't be a problem.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.875
You have
the right attitude.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.834
You have what
I like to call...

06:55.834 --> 06:58.291
the wrong attitude.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.500
Jemaine:
♪ All the hotties
at the party ♪

07:00.500 --> 07:02.625
♪ Shaking all of
your booties ♪

07:02.625 --> 07:03.834
♪ Yeah. ♪

07:03.834 --> 07:06.083
Jemaine, I need to
go to sleep now.

07:06.083 --> 07:09.000
Bret, do you think
it should be, "Shake
their booties, yeah,"

07:09.000 --> 07:10.500
or "Shake
their boobies, yeah"?

07:10.500 --> 07:12.417
'cause when I think
of shake your booties,

07:12.417 --> 07:14.583
I think of those little
boots that babies wear.

07:14.583 --> 07:16.667
You know, those little
woolen boots that they wear.

07:16.667 --> 07:19.125
You know, babies wear those
little woolen boots.

07:19.125 --> 07:20.750
- Yeah.
- Like shake your booties.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.625
I don't know, man.
I've got work in
the morning.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.041
I need to go to sleep.

07:24.041 --> 07:25.792
I can't believe you got
that job and I didn't.

07:25.792 --> 07:29.166
- You need to work on
your people skills.
- Yeah, shut up, Bret.

07:40.125 --> 07:42.250
- Hey, man.
- Oh, hey, Bret.

07:42.250 --> 07:44.333
I bought the chairs
back off of Dave.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.041
You're kind of late
for band practice.

07:46.041 --> 07:48.208
Sorry, man, we had
some after work drinks
with Eddie.

07:48.208 --> 07:50.583
Yeah, well you could have
told me, so...

07:50.583 --> 07:52.291
Should we do
some more practice?

07:52.291 --> 07:55.333
Bret, it's 7:00.
I've been practicing
for four hours.

07:55.333 --> 07:57.083
Well, what are you
doing now?

07:57.083 --> 07:58.750
Well, it's
my free time now.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.834
I'm gonna do some
of my leisure activities.

08:00.834 --> 08:03.000
I'm gonna sit down
over there for a bit

08:03.000 --> 08:04.708
and then I'm gonna do
some light reading.

08:04.708 --> 08:06.750
Well, if it's your free time,
let's do some more practice.

08:06.750 --> 08:08.667
You could have practiced too,
if you were here,

08:08.667 --> 08:11.500
but you weren't,
so sorry.

08:13.542 --> 08:15.583
- What are you doing?
- I'm just, you know,

08:15.583 --> 08:17.333
sitting down.
It's my free time.

08:17.333 --> 08:20.083
I can do whatever I like.
This is what I like to do.

08:27.250 --> 08:30.083
- Hello, Bret.
- What are you guys
doing here?

08:30.083 --> 08:31.959
- Emergency band meeting.
- I'm working.

08:31.959 --> 08:34.166
- This is my work.
- You're not working,
you're just holding a sign.

08:34.166 --> 08:36.625
- Public foot path.
- This is my work.
Get out of here.

08:36.625 --> 08:38.500
Come on,
band meeting.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.583
- Bret.
- Present.

08:40.583 --> 08:42.417
- Jemaine.
- Present.

08:42.417 --> 08:44.083
Murray, present.

08:44.083 --> 08:47.583
And good news anyway.
The Trade and Migrant Expo,
it's been okayed.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.333
New Zealand wants you to
be in their stall.

08:49.333 --> 08:51.250
What's the Trade
and Migrant Expo?

08:51.250 --> 08:54.041
Well, they're stalls from
all the different countries
of the world.

08:54.041 --> 08:56.250
And the Australians, as
always, have got their stall

08:56.250 --> 08:57.792
right next to
the New Zealand stall.

08:57.792 --> 08:59.542
But this year,
with you guys playing,

08:59.542 --> 09:02.250
we're gonna blow those
Aussies out of the water.
I can't wait.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.542
Bloody showoffs.

09:03.542 --> 09:06.458
- When is that?
- Uh, Thursday 3:00 p.m.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.500
No, I can't go.
I've got work.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.333
- I finish at 2:00.
- You got to go, it's a gig.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.959
- I don't know.
- What's more important?
The band or your job?

09:12.959 --> 09:16.417
Yeah well, I got the job
'cause we didn't have any gigs.

09:16.417 --> 09:18.792
How can I give you a gig
if you've got this job?

09:18.792 --> 09:21.458
Yeah, but that's why
I got the job-- 'cause
there were no gigs.

09:21.458 --> 09:23.959
Well, I can't get you a gig
if you're gonna always go
and do a job.

09:23.959 --> 09:26.792
Yeah, but that's--
I needed the job 'cause
there were no gigs.

09:26.792 --> 09:28.959
Well, I've got you a gig,
so what's with the job?

09:28.959 --> 09:31.583
Yeah, but that's--
that the thing.
I got the job

09:31.583 --> 09:33.458
because there were
no gigs, man.

09:33.458 --> 09:35.667
It's a chicken-egg
situation.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.750
What do you mean? What's--
what's he mean, chicken?

09:37.750 --> 09:40.792
Well you know,
"what came first,
the chicken or the egg?"

09:40.792 --> 09:42.417
That's irrelevant,
isn't it?

09:42.417 --> 09:44.542
It's stupid.
The chicken, obviously.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.458
Well, where did
the chicken come from?

09:46.458 --> 09:48.333
Well, it came from the--

09:48.333 --> 09:50.834
- Oh.
- You see, the egg.

09:50.834 --> 09:53.792
You're the egg.
You're a bad egg,
all right?

09:53.792 --> 09:57.000
You've derailed this
meeting with another
obscure comment.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.917
Well, I could just record
my part on tape, I guess,

09:58.917 --> 10:00.667
and Jemaine
could play along.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.667
Tape?
A cassette tape?

10:02.667 --> 10:04.959
No, you can't
do that, Bret.

10:04.959 --> 10:07.500
I'm not happy
with that.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.125
Those hot dogs
any good?

10:10.125 --> 10:12.000
- Yeah, they're good.
- How much?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.250
- $2.
- How many sauces?

10:14.250 --> 10:17.500
- Two.
- You'd expect three sauces
for that, wouldn't you?

10:17.500 --> 10:20.834
I got to get back
to work, guys.

10:20.834 --> 10:24.291
And, folks, please,
I'm sorry about the particles.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.500
Don't breathe 'em in.
We don't know what they are.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.959
I would suggest
quick, short breaths.

10:28.959 --> 10:31.542
Now, Georgina, I'm gonna
give you "Jewelry Sale," okay?

10:31.542 --> 10:34.208
I'm gonna put you at
Broadway and Canal.

10:34.208 --> 10:36.875
Now this is
basic stuff, okay?

10:36.875 --> 10:38.250
You know this.

10:38.250 --> 10:41.083
Bret, I'm gonna give you
something a little harder.

10:41.083 --> 10:43.458
All right?
"Men's Suits."

10:43.458 --> 10:45.417
Okay?
Now, Matthew,

10:45.417 --> 10:47.041
I want you to hold
the sign just like Bret.

10:47.041 --> 10:49.208
- Bret, how are
you holding it?
- I'm just holding it.

10:49.208 --> 10:51.375
Exactly-- just holding.
Coco, you're late.

10:51.375 --> 10:53.125
Actually, Bret,
you know what?

10:53.125 --> 10:54.875
I'm gonna give you
"Phones," all right?

10:54.875 --> 10:56.834
I want you to show
Coco the ropes.

10:56.834 --> 10:59.542
Coco, this is Bret.
All right, everybody,

10:59.542 --> 11:01.333
really look alive
out there.

11:01.333 --> 11:03.542
This could be
a launching pad for you.

11:03.542 --> 11:05.959
People who hold
signs go on

11:05.959 --> 11:08.750
to hold many things.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.333
I'm in a band.

11:13.333 --> 11:15.250
Cool.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.917
What's your name again?

11:16.917 --> 11:18.750
- Bret.
- Brit?

11:18.750 --> 11:19.708
Bret.

11:19.708 --> 11:21.917
- Brit?
- Bret.

11:21.917 --> 11:24.458
Brit like--
like Brittany?

11:24.458 --> 11:26.917
Ah, no,
B-r-e-t.

11:26.917 --> 11:28.917
- Oh, Bret.
- Yeah.

11:28.917 --> 11:30.625
It just sounds
like Brit.

11:30.625 --> 11:32.417
I like your
English accent.

11:32.417 --> 11:34.750
- New Zealand.
- Oh, from New Zealand.

11:34.750 --> 11:37.333
- Yeah.
- I hear it's beautiful.

11:37.333 --> 11:39.250
There's Vikings there,
right?

11:39.250 --> 11:41.291
Eh, yeah.

11:41.291 --> 11:43.417
I had a friend who
went there, she loved it.

11:43.417 --> 11:46.583
She's a-- she's a big
"Lord of the Rings" fan.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.583
- ( music starts up )
- Oh my God.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.000
She's so hot.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.959
- She's so flippin' hot.
- ( continues talking )

11:53.959 --> 11:55.959
She's like a curry.

11:55.959 --> 11:59.291
I want to tell her
how hot she is but she'll
think I'm being sexist.

11:59.291 --> 12:03.125
She's so hot
she's making me sexist.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.333
Bitch.

12:05.333 --> 12:09.417
I think I need a 1983
Casio DG-20 electric guitar

12:09.417 --> 12:11.917
set to electric mandolin.

12:11.917 --> 12:13.500

12:13.500 --> 12:15.291

Murray:
Come to New Zealand.
Beautiful scenery.

13:59.458 --> 14:00.750
It's like
"Lord of the Rings."

14:00.750 --> 14:02.500
We've got
interesting attractions--

14:02.500 --> 14:04.083
a toothbrush fence.

14:04.083 --> 14:06.875
Imagine that, a whole fence
made out of toothbrushes.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.333
Over 50 toothbrushes.

14:08.333 --> 14:12.250
Bungee jumping.
You like bungee jumping, sir?

14:12.250 --> 14:13.583
New Zealand.

14:13.583 --> 14:16.291
New Zealand.

14:16.291 --> 14:18.667
Yeah, keep--
hold onto that.

14:18.667 --> 14:21.125
Cheer up, Greg.

14:21.125 --> 14:22.583
Try and...

14:22.583 --> 14:24.542
Where's Bret?
Is there any sign of him?

14:24.542 --> 14:26.625
I'm running out of
attractions.

14:26.625 --> 14:28.583
No.

14:28.583 --> 14:30.542
I-- I don't know
where he is.

14:30.542 --> 14:32.917
Well, tuck your shirt in.
You look messy.

14:32.917 --> 14:35.625
Try and be proud
of New Zealand.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.959
Oh, no.

14:37.959 --> 14:39.834
Hey, Murray.

14:39.834 --> 14:42.166
- How you doing?
- Maxwell, good.

14:42.166 --> 14:44.458
- Stall looks great.
- Thanks.

14:44.458 --> 14:48.000
This fence of toothbrushes
sounds fascinating.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.875
Probably haven't got one
in Australia, have you?

14:49.875 --> 14:51.083
- No.
- No.

14:51.083 --> 14:53.750
Got Ayer's Rock, mate.
Big huge rock.

14:53.750 --> 14:55.083
- Yeah, we've got rocks.
- Massive.

14:55.083 --> 14:58.125
We've got a big--
smaller rocks.

14:58.125 --> 15:00.708
When's this band
of yours playing?
Can't wait to hear it.

15:00.708 --> 15:03.458
Pretty soon. We're just
waiting for the rest of
the band to turn up.

15:03.458 --> 15:06.291
Right. Just 'cause
we've got the Wet n' Wild
Welcome Girls

15:06.291 --> 15:07.959
doing their bikini
barbeque thing

15:07.959 --> 15:10.250
and the music's
gonna be pumping.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.792
I don't want to
drown out your... band.

15:12.792 --> 15:14.834
- Better start soon.
- Man: Check, check one two.

15:14.834 --> 15:17.917
Check one two.
Checking one two, one...

15:17.917 --> 15:19.917
We'd better just start.
Forget Bret.

15:19.917 --> 15:22.166
Man:
G'day.
G'day, one two...

15:22.166 --> 15:24.166
I have to rewind it.

15:24.166 --> 15:25.875
Is this your band, Murray?

15:25.875 --> 15:27.792
A guy and a tape?

15:27.792 --> 15:29.125
Classic.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.959
- Press play.
- I'm trying, man.

15:30.959 --> 15:34.291
- Drop the beat.

- Thank you.

16:20.917 --> 16:23.750

- Guys.

16:29.583 --> 16:31.417
Hey, sorry
I'm late, guys.

16:31.417 --> 16:32.834
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:32.834 --> 16:34.834
- Have you done the gig?
- Yes, Bret.

16:34.834 --> 16:36.500
Oh, I'm sorry.
It took me ages to get here.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.708
- Well the tape was on time.
- Good. How'd it sound?

16:38.708 --> 16:40.041
- It was all right?
- Good.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.750
- Really good, actually, yeah.
- Okay.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.792
There's very little
difference between you
and the tape, I noticed.

16:43.792 --> 16:45.583
- Oh whatever, Murray.
- And it doesn't talk back.

16:45.583 --> 16:47.792
Yeah, but the tape's
lifeless, isn't it?
It's a tape.

16:47.792 --> 16:51.208
It's not like having
a real musician up there,
is it? Hey, Jemaine?

16:51.208 --> 16:52.875
I didn't really
notice the difference.

16:52.875 --> 16:55.625
The difference is
the tape didn't
let us down, all right?

16:55.625 --> 16:57.583
It made it,
it played well.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.875
And the more
I think about it,
the more I like it.

16:59.875 --> 17:01.792
I've got a right mind to
actually fire you, Bret,

17:01.792 --> 17:03.458
and just keep Jemaine
and the tape.

17:03.458 --> 17:05.125
- Aw, yeah,
you're bluffing, Murray.
- I'm not bluffing.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.458
- Yes you are.
- I'm not!

17:06.458 --> 17:08.083
- Yes you are.
- He is.

17:08.083 --> 17:09.834
He is. He told me he
was going to pretend

17:09.834 --> 17:11.333
to fire you
if you were late.

17:11.333 --> 17:12.750
Good one.
Yeah, I was going to.

17:12.750 --> 17:14.667
- So you were bluffing?
- Yeah, but I'm not now.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.250
This is the whole--
I've turned around.

17:16.250 --> 17:18.750
I'm afraid to say, Bret,
that you are--

17:18.750 --> 17:20.000
You got the--
Check the tape?

17:20.000 --> 17:21.500
- ( tape deck opens )
- Yep.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.458
- What, are you serious?
- You're fired.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.166
And both of you--
I'm not giving you a lift home.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.583
- Oh, why me?
- No, 'cause you
ruined my bluff.

17:28.583 --> 17:31.417
The whole bluff thing.
Goodbye, Bret.

17:31.417 --> 17:35.000
There's other attractions.
Check out the Indian one.

17:40.291 --> 17:43.041
Thank for
giving us a ride,
Mel and Doug.

17:43.041 --> 17:45.458
Anytime.

17:45.458 --> 17:47.125
Hey, Bret, are you--
are you all right?

17:47.125 --> 17:49.917
I noticed you weren't
onstage and there was
a tape and--

17:49.917 --> 17:52.083
Yeah, I'm not in
the band anymore, Mel.

17:52.083 --> 17:53.291
Murray just fired me.

17:53.291 --> 17:55.458
What do you mean,
you're not in the band?

17:55.458 --> 17:57.166
Did you hear that, Doug?

17:57.166 --> 17:58.917
Yeah.
It's terrible.

17:58.917 --> 18:02.125
It is terrible, Doug.
It's terrible!

18:02.125 --> 18:04.875
My God.
Can Murray do that?

18:04.875 --> 18:06.667
- No.
- Yeah.

18:06.667 --> 18:10.166
Well, all your fans are
gonna be devastated.

18:10.166 --> 18:12.417
- There's just you, Mel.
- Yeah.

18:12.417 --> 18:14.458
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

18:14.458 --> 18:15.792
What are you
gonna do, Bret?

18:15.792 --> 18:17.417
- What-- I mean...
- Well...

18:17.417 --> 18:19.500
I guess just
concentrate on my job--

18:19.500 --> 18:21.542
holding signs.
It's going pretty well.

18:21.542 --> 18:23.166
Oh yeah,
I've seen you.

18:23.166 --> 18:24.750
I've seen you
a lot.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.667
You really know how
to move that sign.

18:26.667 --> 18:30.875
You just manipulate it
and caress it with your
skillful hands.

18:30.875 --> 18:33.500
Thank you
very much, Mel.
Yeah, thank you.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.333
You're welcome.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.750
You were good
tonight, Jemaine.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.333
Oh, thank you, Mel.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.667
Way better than
those Australian girls
in their bikinis.

18:42.667 --> 18:44.834
- I didn't like them.
- Oh, I liked them.

18:44.834 --> 18:47.041
- I hated them.
- Mmm.

18:47.041 --> 18:49.875
So is it just gonna be
you and the tape for a bit?

18:49.875 --> 18:52.583
Yeah, actually we've got a--
we've got a gig.

18:52.583 --> 18:54.959
- Oh, you got a gig?
- What, a real gig?

18:54.959 --> 18:57.500
Yeah-- yeah, uh...

18:57.500 --> 18:59.708
a guy-- a guy saw us

18:59.708 --> 19:01.333
and wants to book us.

19:01.333 --> 19:02.542
Well, I'll be there.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.875
You bet your ass
I'll be there.

19:04.875 --> 19:07.417
I'll be at every one.

19:08.375 --> 19:09.625
Oh, man.

19:09.625 --> 19:12.041
The car could just
burst into flames right now

19:12.041 --> 19:14.542
and this would be the way
to go, huh, guys? Just--

19:14.542 --> 19:15.917
Just here, thanks, Doug.

19:15.917 --> 19:17.250
- Mel: What?
- Doug: Where?

19:17.250 --> 19:18.875
- Here?
- Anywhere.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.625
This was
a good day, yeah.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.750
( cheering )

19:58.291 --> 20:00.750
Okay, so how else is
the tape better than Bret?

20:00.750 --> 20:03.542
More compact.

20:03.542 --> 20:05.417
Bret's pretty
compact, though.

20:05.417 --> 20:07.792
I can carry the tape.
Just carry it around with me.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.750
You could carry Bret.
How much can you press?

20:09.750 --> 20:11.959
Not to a gig. I couldn't
carry him to a gig.

20:11.959 --> 20:13.625
I can just put this
into my pocket

20:13.625 --> 20:15.625
and just carry it
to a gig.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.125
- More compact.
- Mmm.

20:17.125 --> 20:19.834
That'll save money
on subway fares, too.

20:22.125 --> 20:25.417
- Do you miss Bret, though?
- Not really.

20:25.417 --> 20:27.000
- You don't miss him?
- No.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.959
- No?
- No.

20:28.959 --> 20:30.708
You miss him?

20:30.708 --> 20:32.708
- A little bit.
- A little bit, eh?

20:32.708 --> 20:34.959
I miss him. I might
put that down as a...

20:34.959 --> 20:36.667
- Yeah, put "miss him."
- ...as a thing.

20:36.667 --> 20:38.333
Yeah.

20:41.417 --> 20:44.125
Well, no matter
which way you look at it,

20:44.125 --> 20:46.291
the tape's still winning.

20:46.291 --> 20:48.291
- Make sure you don't lose it.
- I won't.

20:48.291 --> 20:50.000
Don't stand next to
any big magnets.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.625
Why would I stand next to
big magnets, Murray?

20:51.625 --> 20:54.333
I don't know what you do
in your personal life.

20:55.834 --> 20:58.708
So that's it.

20:58.708 --> 21:00.250
You've got the tape,
haven't you?

21:00.250 --> 21:02.000
- Yeah, I got the tape.
- Let's see it.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.500
I got the tape,
I told you.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.250
- Let's have a look.
- I've got it in my pocket.

21:05.250 --> 21:07.125
I just want to see it.

21:09.708 --> 21:11.625
Oh, careful!
Now look what you've done.

21:11.625 --> 21:13.291
- It's caught on my zipper.
- Yeah, leave it.

21:13.291 --> 21:14.875
- Leave it, careful.
- It's all right.

21:14.875 --> 21:16.667
- It's just caught on my zipper.
- Wait, it's all right.

21:16.667 --> 21:18.834
I've got a trick here--
from the '80s, look.

21:21.208 --> 21:22.834
Mmm.

21:22.834 --> 21:25.834
Does this mean I'm not
in a band anymore?

21:25.834 --> 21:27.875
I'm afraid not, Jemaine.

21:30.125 --> 21:33.208
Greg, could we get a couple
of tissues in here?

21:34.708 --> 21:36.250
Greg?

21:37.208 --> 21:39.166
Chin up, Jemaine.

21:39.166 --> 21:40.959
Actually, don't
worry about it.

21:40.959 --> 21:42.959
You don't want to see
two grown men crying.

21:42.959 --> 21:45.041
Go away, Greg.

21:45.041 --> 21:47.083
Yeah.

21:47.083 --> 21:49.458
Sue them.
Just sue them.

21:49.458 --> 21:51.041
Oh-- oh,
I got to go.

21:51.041 --> 21:53.542
Hey, man.

21:53.542 --> 21:55.375
Hey, Bret.

21:55.375 --> 21:57.417
What's that thing
in your ear?

21:57.417 --> 21:59.083
It's my
bluetooth brand.

21:59.083 --> 22:01.041
Everyone has 'em around here.
It's a business thing.

22:01.041 --> 22:02.542
You don't know
what it is, do you?

22:02.542 --> 22:05.208
- Not really.
Do you know what it is?
- No.

22:05.208 --> 22:07.542
I think you use it
with the phone.

22:07.542 --> 22:10.000
Oh right, I see.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.500
Oh yeah yeah,
I see.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.708
- Yeah yeah, that makes sense.
- Hey, Bret?

22:13.708 --> 22:15.417
I'm thinking of getting
the band back together.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.834
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

22:16.834 --> 22:18.500
I thought you were doing
pretty well with the tape.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.375
The tape's no replacement
for you, man.

22:20.375 --> 22:21.917
- Really?
- No, it broke.

22:21.917 --> 22:24.291
What about it?

22:24.291 --> 22:28.417
The original lineup--
you, me...

22:29.792 --> 22:32.667
- You and me.
- I don't know, man.

22:32.667 --> 22:35.250
Look at me.
I've changed.

22:35.250 --> 22:38.500
I've grown up.
I've got a job.
I've got a career.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.750
I drink coffee now.

22:43.083 --> 22:45.291
Oh God, yuck.

22:45.291 --> 22:48.083
I just don't--
I don't know if I can
do it anymore.

22:48.083 --> 22:50.500
I don't even know what
you're talking about, man.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.583
- Just join the band.
- No, I'm not joining the band.

22:52.583 --> 22:54.583
- Join the band.
- I'm not joining the band.

22:54.583 --> 22:56.875
- Join the band.
- No.

22:59.625 --> 23:02.000
Free phones.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.125
You've given up
the dream, Bret!

23:07.125 --> 23:08.542
I've woken up.

23:08.542 --> 23:10.041
I'll see you
at home.

23:10.041 --> 23:12.458
Okay, man.
Can you grab some milk?

23:23.875 --> 23:25.083
( door closes )

23:25.083 --> 23:26.834
Yeah, well I'll see
what I can do.

23:26.834 --> 23:30.083
Yeah.
I've got a 5:00
and a 6:00.

23:30.083 --> 23:32.125
I'll pencil
you in.

23:32.125 --> 23:33.959
Okay, yeah.

23:33.959 --> 23:37.208
7.3. All right.
Bye.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.708
Hey, man.

23:38.708 --> 23:41.041
Hey.
What's that?

23:41.041 --> 23:43.333
Hamburger.

23:43.333 --> 23:45.083
Looks amazing.

23:45.083 --> 23:47.208
Are-- are you
finished with that?

23:48.500 --> 23:50.667
- I haven't started.
- Oh.

23:50.667 --> 23:53.000
Do you want to
join the band?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.667
No.

24:03.542 --> 24:05.166
What is that?

24:11.083 --> 24:12.875
How's the band going?

24:12.875 --> 24:14.792
Oh, I'm not in
the band anymore.

24:14.792 --> 24:16.333
- I had to quit.
- Really?

24:16.333 --> 24:18.166
Yeah.
They wanted me back

24:18.166 --> 24:20.875
but I'm just
concentrating on signs

24:20.875 --> 24:23.250
and my career and
everything, you know?

24:23.250 --> 24:25.834
Are you gonna start
another band?

24:25.834 --> 24:27.291
No.
Probably not.

24:27.291 --> 24:29.166
Bigger and
better things.

24:29.166 --> 24:30.417
Signs?

24:30.417 --> 24:31.875
Yeah.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.542
I thought you
loved signs?

24:33.542 --> 24:35.834
- Signs are okay.
- Yeah.

24:35.834 --> 24:38.000
I prefer bands.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.917
- You prefer bands?
- Yeah, I love bands.

24:40.917 --> 24:43.208
Oh you-- really?
You just never...

24:43.208 --> 24:45.041
Oh.

24:45.041 --> 24:47.041
I'll see you later, Bret?

24:47.041 --> 24:49.875
Cool, yeah.

24:49.875 --> 24:52.500
( guitar strumming )

24:52.500 --> 24:54.417
I'm back in the band.

24:54.417 --> 24:55.792
I'm back in
the band!

24:55.792 --> 24:59.083
I'm back in the band.
Hey, back in the band!

24:59.083 --> 25:01.458
Back in the band!

25:01.458 --> 25:03.834
Back in the band.

25:03.834 --> 25:06.375
Put the cat down.
We can't afford it.

25:06.375 --> 25:09.125
I'm back in the band.

25:09.125 --> 25:11.208
Back in the band!

25:11.208 --> 25:14.291
Back in the band!

25:14.291 --> 25:16.083
Murray:
Okay, it's been
a very difficult decision,

25:16.083 --> 25:17.959
because many of you are
very talented, all right?

25:17.959 --> 25:19.917
- Some of you
are too talented.
- Hey.

25:19.917 --> 25:21.542
Josh, is it?
In the back there.

25:21.542 --> 25:24.583
High scores but
a little arrogant,
all right?

25:24.583 --> 25:26.250
But it's not
about talent.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.792
Okay? It's about
the look.

25:27.792 --> 25:30.875
That's why we've decided
to give the job to Brent.

25:30.875 --> 25:33.542
All right, well done.
It's not about talent,
as I say.

25:33.542 --> 25:34.750
You're not
the talented one.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.417
But you do look
very similar.

25:36.417 --> 25:38.083
And with one
letter difference,

25:38.083 --> 25:40.792
it's quite easy to just
do the transition there.

25:40.792 --> 25:43.291
Hang on.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.625
Bret, is that you?

25:45.625 --> 25:48.125
What are you doing here?
You have no business here.

25:48.125 --> 25:49.458
I wanted to get
back in the band.

25:49.458 --> 25:51.125
Well, if you'd turned up
half an hour ago

25:51.125 --> 25:53.166
you could have been
at the audition.
It's too late.

25:53.166 --> 25:55.583
- Brent's in the band.
- What about your job?

25:55.583 --> 25:59.125
Well, Eddie says I
can make the job fit
around the gigs. So...

25:59.125 --> 26:02.208
he wants to support
the band as much as
possible, actually.

26:02.208 --> 26:03.625
He made us this sign.

26:03.625 --> 26:06.291
Wow.
"Hot Dogs."

26:06.291 --> 26:07.959
Oh, no that one.
That one.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.875
Oh wow,
that's fantastic.

26:10.875 --> 26:12.917
It's really great.

26:12.917 --> 26:15.625
You know, Jemaine
really missed you.

26:15.625 --> 26:17.333
- No, I didn't.
- You did.

26:17.333 --> 26:18.625
No, I didn't.

26:18.625 --> 26:20.750
- You did.
- You-- you did.

26:20.750 --> 26:22.041
- No, you're like--
- He did.

26:22.041 --> 26:23.125
No, a little bit.

26:23.125 --> 26:24.458
You could see
that you were--

26:24.458 --> 26:26.834
both-- we both
missed you.

26:26.834 --> 26:29.125
Oh, um,
sorry everyone.

26:29.125 --> 26:30.583
Ah, bad news, guys.

26:30.583 --> 26:32.834
This is Bret.
He's gonna take
the position.

26:32.834 --> 26:35.125
So, yeah,
that's it, I guess.

26:35.125 --> 26:37.333
- What about Brent?
- Yeah, Brent, um...

26:37.333 --> 26:40.375
Sorry. Uh, we'll
keep your number on file.

26:40.375 --> 26:42.458
The rest of you,
thanks a lot.

26:42.458 --> 26:47.000
Have a good day.
And yeah, welcome back, Bret!

26:51.375 --> 26:54.041
( theme music playing )
