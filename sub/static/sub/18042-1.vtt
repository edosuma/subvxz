01:58.480 --> 02:00.880
I still can't believe
we're really on our way.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.760
Nor can I.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.840
It's so fantastic.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.280
Thank you, darling.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.960
Don't run away.
I won't be a sec.

03:07.600 --> 03:08.720
Fiona.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.880
Blimey.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.160
What's the matter?

03:17.200 --> 03:19.400
Can you give me a hand?

03:20.840 --> 03:22.480
There we are.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.520
God.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.520
There we go, that's better.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.480
I'm going to wipe away
those tears.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.480
God.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.440
Take a deep breath.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.000
You'll feel better.

03:47.040 --> 03:50.000
A deep breath of fresh air,
that's what you need.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.160
Here.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.920
- There.
- You're very pretty.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.280
There we are.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.440
There.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.800
Are you going to Istanbul?

04:04.840 --> 04:08.040
Yes. Then we're flying
on to Bombay.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.040
How far are you going?

04:12.240 --> 04:13.480
Further.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.600
Much further.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.840
But why on earth go to India?

04:22.880 --> 04:25.720
I think we needed a break
from the rat race...

04:25.760 --> 04:28.320
and India's got so much
to teach the West.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.200
Really? What, for example?

04:30.240 --> 04:33.600
Well, you know, inner serenity,
that kind of stuff.

04:33.640 --> 04:37.160
The Karma-Nirvana syndrome.
Lot of poppycock, I'm afraid.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.600
No, India's all flies,
smells, and beggars...

04:39.600 --> 04:42.960
and as for serenity, it's
the noisiest place on earth.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.280
If you say so, I'm sure.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.880
Now, I'm sure Mr. Singh
is just being modest...

04:47.920 --> 04:49.120
about his own part
of the world.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.200
I can't wait to get there.

04:51.240 --> 04:52.640
It's my anniversary treat.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.640
We've been married
for seven years.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.120
So it's a form
of marital therapy.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.320
It's quite unnecessary,
dear lady.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.280
With a wife as beautiful
as yourself...

05:00.320 --> 05:02.600
any man would be proof
against the seven-year itch.

05:07.760 --> 05:08.880
You tired, sweetheart?

05:08.920 --> 05:10.560
Absolutely whacked.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.520
Must be all this sea air.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.200
How about a nightcap?

05:16.240 --> 05:17.320
How about bed?

05:17.360 --> 05:18.800
Come on, just one.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.720
No, honestly not. You go.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.440
Just take me to my cabin.
I'm out on my feet.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.840
If you're sure.

05:24.880 --> 05:25.960
I'm certain.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.880
Anyway, it's bad
for an old married couple...

05:27.920 --> 05:31.080
to be glued together
all the time.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.520
What will it be, sir?

06:08.560 --> 06:10.200
Whiskey and soda, please.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.200
You feeling better?

06:41.240 --> 06:42.840
Better than what?

06:42.880 --> 06:44.560
You remember the...

06:44.600 --> 06:47.200
this afternoon in the...

06:47.240 --> 06:48.640
in the loo.

06:48.680 --> 06:49.920
The loo?

06:49.960 --> 06:52.360
Is it your usual pickup routine?

06:59.720 --> 07:01.560
Of course I remember.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.360
I have a perfect memory...

07:04.400 --> 07:06.480
when I feel like it.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.840
Right.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.480
Is this some kind of game?

07:12.920 --> 07:14.840
You want to dance?

07:16.120 --> 07:18.600
I'm not much of a dancer.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.640
That figures.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.280
What's your name?

07:29.320 --> 07:30.440
Nigel Dobson.

07:33.840 --> 07:37.120
OK, Nigel, amuse me.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.800
Say something funny.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.760
Blimey.

07:44.720 --> 07:48.080
You're French, aren't you?
I can tell from your accent.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.840
Your English is very, very good,
but for some reason...

07:49.880 --> 07:52.080
I can always tell
with frogs.

07:52.120 --> 07:54.680
Sorry. Stupid thing to say.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.360
Just slipped out.
Schoolboy expression.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.680
Comes from working in the city.
I'm a Eurobond dealer.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.360
We're always
calling people frogs.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.520
You're right. Boring.

08:03.560 --> 08:07.400
But, anyway, you call us
roast beef, don't you?

08:07.440 --> 08:08.600
They're roast beef.

08:08.640 --> 08:11.320
I think that's how you
pronounce it, anyway.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.720
You're too funny for me, Nigel.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.240
I'm choking with laughter.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.760
So long.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.600
I leave you to your magnetic,
irresistible personality.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.679
Romantic, isn't it?

08:34.720 --> 08:36.520
Yeah, it is. Splendid.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.840
You're Nigel, aren't you?

08:46.440 --> 08:48.280
Sorry. Do I know you?

08:51.040 --> 08:52.480
Beware of her.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.280
Right.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.840
She's a walking man trap.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.560
Sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.760
Sure, you do.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.640
I'm her husband.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.720
Look what she did to me.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.160
I'm sorry.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.880
Let me ask you something, Nigel.

09:15.920 --> 09:19.240
You don't mind
if I call you Nigel, do you?

09:19.280 --> 09:21.560
What do you think of her?

09:21.600 --> 09:23.920
If you mean
who I think you mean...

09:23.960 --> 09:25.520
she's very good-Iooking.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.560
Yeah, sure,
all of that and more.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.000
She gives you a hard-on,
doesn't she?

09:30.040 --> 09:33.200
- Beg your pardon?
- Come on, don't be so British.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.440
You'd like to fuck her.
Admit it. It's no crime.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.360
I've no idea
what you're driving at.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.840
Cut the crap!

09:39.880 --> 09:43.880
You're itching to know
some more about her, aren't you?

09:43.920 --> 09:45.840
Well, aren't you?

09:45.880 --> 09:47.120
Here.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.640
Do me a favor, would you?

09:49.680 --> 09:52.520
Help me over
the goddamn step here.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.480
They don't design these boats
for my kind.

09:55.520 --> 09:56.640
Yeah, sure.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.720
Get inside there.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.360
Grab the wheels. The wheels.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.520
Up.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.800
I hate these fucking boats.

10:20.360 --> 10:24.640
It's good of you to take pity
on an obnoxious cripple.

10:24.680 --> 10:27.000
I don't know you at all...

10:27.040 --> 10:28.640
but somehow
I have the feeling...

10:28.680 --> 10:32.440
that you're exactly the listener
that I've been looking for.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.760
I hope you'll find
my story interesting.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.960
I realize it's hard
to relate to something...

10:39.000 --> 10:41.320
that doesn't concern you.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.240
Or maybe it already does.

10:51.840 --> 10:55.120
We have the place to ourselves.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.080
Mimi has her own cabin.

11:03.760 --> 11:04.840
Thanks.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.080
Eternity for me began
one fall day in Paris...

11:18.120 --> 11:19.680
aboard the 96 bus...

11:19.720 --> 11:22.160
which shuttles
between Montparnasse...

11:22.200 --> 11:23.880
and Porte des Lilas.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.280
Controle des billets,
s'il vous plait.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.960
Mademoiselle.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.200
Madame.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.160
Merci.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.560
Monsieur, votre billet,
s'il vous plait.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.640
Je ne I'ai pas.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.400
I'd been granted
a glimpse of Heaven...

13:16.400 --> 13:19.080
then dumped on the sidewalk
at rue d'Assas.

13:19.120 --> 13:22.280
I still have no idea
why you're telling me all this.

13:22.320 --> 13:25.720
I'd always wanted
to be a writer.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.400
My grandfather...

13:27.440 --> 13:30.280
made a fortune in the surgical
appliance business...

13:30.320 --> 13:32.680
and set up a trust fund for me.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.760
On his death,
I found myself in receipt...

13:34.800 --> 13:38.480
of sufficient allowance
to enable me to move to Paris.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.320
Paris...

13:45.360 --> 13:47.440
my dream city.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.240
Hemingway, Miller...

13:49.280 --> 13:50.920
Scott Fitzgerald.

13:50.960 --> 13:54.360
I was determined to follow
in their footsteps...

13:54.400 --> 13:57.240
maybe too determined
for my own good.

13:57.280 --> 14:01.520
Maybe that's what killed any
originality I ever possessed.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.600
After eight years,
all I had to show...

14:03.640 --> 14:07.320
for my literary exertions were
three unpublished novels...

14:07.360 --> 14:10.640
and a stack
of reject slips this high.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.360
But who cared?

14:12.400 --> 14:14.080
Sidewalk cafes...

14:14.120 --> 14:15.720
fluttering skirts...

14:15.760 --> 14:17.480
fleeting affairs.

14:17.520 --> 14:22.280
Paris was heaven
until that day on the bus.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.960
Et tu m'aides?

14:54.320 --> 14:57.080
It was no good.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.840
I couldn't write,
couldn't sleep...

14:59.880 --> 15:02.640
couldn't get her out of my mind.

15:02.680 --> 15:05.520
She was somewhere out there...

15:05.560 --> 15:08.680
my sorceress in white sneakers.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.200
But where?

15:16.720 --> 15:19.800
I haunted that 96 bus route.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.680
It became an obsession.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.360
Even the drivers
began to recognize me.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.640
Ca va?

16:36.560 --> 16:37.960
Désirez un apéritif?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.240
Moi, je meurs de faun.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.600
Ouais, ouais moi aussi.

16:40.640 --> 16:44.120
Alors on commande tout de suite.
Qu'est-ce qui vous tente?

16:44.160 --> 16:46.840
Alors, mois,
j'ai envie d'un tartare.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.840
- V oilà.
- Un tartare.

16:51.160 --> 16:55.200
Non attendez plutot
une soupe du jour pour moi.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.200
Non finalement.

17:00.240 --> 17:03.840
J'vais prendre un avocat
avec des crevattes.

17:07.920 --> 17:11.280
J'aurais un apéritif après tout.

17:11.319 --> 17:13.240
Heu martini.

17:13.280 --> 17:14.400
Double.

17:15.720 --> 17:16.800
Et vous?

17:16.839 --> 17:20.560
Moi je prendrai un kir royal,
s'il vous plait.

17:23.359 --> 17:25.000
Excusez-moi.

17:29.760 --> 17:30.880
Je suis desole...

17:30.920 --> 17:32.960
je ne pouvais pas vous
parler tout a I'heure.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.080
C'est pas grave.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.200
V ous rappelez?

17:35.240 --> 17:36.320
You're American?

17:36.360 --> 17:37.760
You remember me?

17:37.840 --> 17:40.160
Of course I remember.
You were very kind.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.560
Now it's your turn
to do something nice for me.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.640
Have dinner with me sometime.
Sometime soon, like tomorrow.

17:44.680 --> 17:45.800
You ever get a night off?

17:45.840 --> 17:46.920
- Yes.
- When?

17:46.960 --> 17:48.160
- Tomorrow.
- Well?

17:48.200 --> 17:50.240
Mimi, magnes le cul?
Ça planche!

17:53.480 --> 17:54.760
Mimi.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.360
She told me to meet her...

18:00.400 --> 18:03.720
at the Centre du Marais
at 10:30.

18:03.760 --> 18:05.240
I was so wound up...

18:05.280 --> 18:08.280
I'd gotten there
a whole half-hour early.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.440
My nerve ends
were jangling like bells.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.280
Here's to old bus route 96.

19:06.440 --> 19:07.960
V oilà, voilà, voilà.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.480
Bonsoir, bonsoir,
monsieur, madame...

19:10.520 --> 19:14.360
vous allez bien qu'est-ce
que vous préfèrez ce soir?

19:14.400 --> 19:16.640
Should we just let him decide?

19:16.680 --> 19:18.080
Ecoutez m'sieur mi char...

19:18.120 --> 19:20.520
ce soir on vous laisse
I'initiative.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.800
Alors, alors.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.880
Permettez-moi
de proposer pour commencer...

19:23.920 --> 19:25.360
"Perle du Blue Elephant."

19:25.360 --> 19:26.920
Non, non, non.
Surprenez-nous.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.360
Très bien, très bien, monsieur.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.800
Faites moi confiance.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.200
I hope, I hope
I didn't make a mistake...

19:32.240 --> 19:33.680
by letting him order...

19:33.680 --> 19:36.080
because I don't speak Thai
so good...

19:36.080 --> 19:39.920
and we might have wound up
eating puppy-dog tails.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.720
Do you mind if I do?

20:47.480 --> 20:50.960
There was a freshness
and innocence about her...

20:51.000 --> 20:52.880
an almost disconcerting blend...

20:52.880 --> 20:55.960
of sexual maturity
and childish naiveté...

20:56.000 --> 20:58.360
that touched
my world-weary heart...

20:58.400 --> 21:01.240
and effaced the age difference
between us.

21:01.280 --> 21:05.520
My roommate is American. Cindy.
You saw her at the dance class.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.360
I met her
when I study in New York.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.640
How long were you there?

21:08.680 --> 21:10.560
Till my money ran out.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.120
Meaning?

21:12.160 --> 21:14.600
Six months. I love New York.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.320
It's the best place
for a dancer. Not for a writer?

21:17.360 --> 21:20.080
Not this one.
I love Paris too much.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.960
Is that what you write about,
Paris?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.400
Paris and people.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.800
Would you let me
read something of yours?

21:26.800 --> 21:28.320
Would you dance for me sometime?

21:28.360 --> 21:30.080
If you like.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.200
Promise?

21:31.240 --> 21:32.520
Promise.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.720
I looked all over for you,
you know.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.720
Did you ever think
you'd see me again?

22:22.040 --> 22:23.120
Really?

22:23.160 --> 22:24.960
Really.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.120
Really?

22:33.120 --> 22:34.560
You kept it.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.800
My feet are cold.

23:33.320 --> 23:34.880
Oh, you have a fireplace.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.320
Does it work?

23:36.400 --> 23:37.840
It sure does.

23:37.880 --> 23:40.080
Why don't you relax
for a second?

23:40.120 --> 23:41.520
I'll make coffee.

23:41.560 --> 23:44.120
- Would you like a hot chocolate?
- Yes, please. Chocolate.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.680
Could we make a fire?

23:45.720 --> 23:47.520
Why not?

23:47.560 --> 23:50.840
You make the fire,
I'll make the coffee...

23:50.880 --> 23:52.320
and the chocolate.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.560
Nothing ever surpassed
the rapture...

26:04.600 --> 26:06.280
of that first awakening.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.240
I might have been Adam...

26:08.240 --> 26:11.040
with the taste of apple
fresh in my mouth.

26:11.080 --> 26:14.040
I was looking at all the beauty
in the world...

26:14.080 --> 26:16.240
embodied in a single
female form...

26:16.280 --> 26:19.880
and I knew, with sudden
blinding certainty...

26:19.920 --> 26:22.080
this was it.

26:47.600 --> 26:51.400
We didn't leave the apartment
for three whole days after that.

26:51.440 --> 26:55.240
We were inseparable by day
and insatiable by night.

26:55.280 --> 26:59.080
Just lived on love
and stale croissants.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.040
She chucked her job.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.440
I couldn't bear
to part with her.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.840
"I'd been granted
a glimpse of heaven...

27:05.840 --> 27:08.040
"then dumped on the sidewalk
of rue d'Assas.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.120
"The gates of paradise
had opened...

27:10.160 --> 27:12.080
"only to slam in my face."

27:12.080 --> 27:14.400
But they opened again, no?

27:14.440 --> 27:15.880
They sure did, baby.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.840
Pretty wide, at that.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.280
Go on. Don't stop.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.720
That's all there is.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.720
What a pity.
I could listen to you forever.

27:42.280 --> 27:44.360
Bravo! Monsieur a gagné
un beau p'tit nounours...

27:44.400 --> 27:45.600
pour la p'tite dame.

27:45.640 --> 27:48.480
C'est bravo ça m'sieur!
Un bon tiereur ça!

27:48.520 --> 27:51.360
V'zavez I'choix avec
ce p'tit nounours là celui-ci!

27:51.400 --> 27:54.040
Y vous plait... celui-ci!

27:54.080 --> 27:55.640
V oilà! Celui-ci!

27:57.160 --> 27:59.520
Madame prend le plus
beau nounours du stand.

27:59.560 --> 28:00.960
Madame est une connaisseuse...

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
et monsieur c'est
un bon tireur.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.040
I love you.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.160
What?

28:33.200 --> 28:34.560
You heard me.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.480
You love me?

31:30.040 --> 31:32.360
Isn't it dangerous?

31:32.400 --> 31:35.320
Not if you know
what you're doing.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.720
Why don't you use an electric?

31:37.760 --> 31:40.160
Americans like electric things.

31:41.120 --> 31:43.000
Not this American.

31:43.040 --> 31:46.640
I know. It makes you feel macho.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.680
You're a real tiger.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.600
You think you're Hemingway.

31:52.640 --> 31:55.000
Hemingway had a beard.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.520
Let me try it.

31:56.560 --> 31:59.520
No way. No way!
I value my hide.

31:59.560 --> 32:01.240
Please?

32:01.280 --> 32:04.160
Please.
Please, just one little try.

32:05.120 --> 32:07.480
Who can refuse you anything?

32:11.640 --> 32:12.920
Like this.

32:14.680 --> 32:16.360
Not too much of an angle.

32:56.880 --> 33:00.680
Her pussy was a neat,
discreet little cleft...

33:00.720 --> 33:03.600
but as soon
as the animal within...

33:03.600 --> 33:06.920
was roused by my caresses,
it would stir...

33:06.960 --> 33:10.280
draw aside the silken curtain
covering its lair...

33:10.320 --> 33:12.720
and become
a carnivorous flower...

33:12.720 --> 33:14.640
a baby's mouth...

33:14.640 --> 33:16.600
greedily sucking my finger.

33:16.640 --> 33:20.600
I loved to tease her clitoris
with the tip of my tongue...

33:20.640 --> 33:22.080
and then abandon it...

33:22.120 --> 33:23.680
wet and glistening...

33:23.720 --> 33:27.720
like a little duck dabbling
in a pool of pink flesh.

33:31.120 --> 33:34.120
Nigel, come on.
Don't look so shocked.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.880
Steady on, old boy.

33:35.920 --> 33:37.880
I'm only going
into such detail...

33:37.920 --> 33:40.800
to show you how completely
enslaved I was...

33:40.840 --> 33:42.200
body and soul...

33:42.240 --> 33:44.080
by this creature
whose dangerous charms...

33:44.120 --> 33:45.920
have made such an impression
on you.

33:45.960 --> 33:50.000
- Why do you keep saying that?
- You mean I'm mistaken?

33:50.040 --> 33:52.480
All right.

33:52.520 --> 33:55.560
Let it go.
Leave me with my memories.

33:55.600 --> 34:00.440
If it in some way helps you get
it off your chest or something...

34:00.480 --> 34:02.960
What a compassionate fellow
you are, Nigel.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.440
Actually, to tell the truth,
I should be going.

34:05.480 --> 34:08.320
My wife will think
I've fallen overboard.

34:08.360 --> 34:10.719
You'd have made
a very good analyst.

34:10.760 --> 34:14.080
Not many men would have listened
to so much for so long.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.920
Well, anyway,
thanks for the drink.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.560
I can't understand why he'd
think you'd be interested...

35:11.600 --> 35:13.000
in all these sordid details.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.120
I haven't a clue.

35:14.160 --> 35:15.240
Probably lets his hair down...

35:15.280 --> 35:17.560
every time he corners
a captive audience, poor chap.

35:17.600 --> 35:20.680
Poor chap.
He's a verbal exhibitionist.

35:20.720 --> 35:22.600
It's his wife I feel sorry for.

35:22.640 --> 35:25.480
Yeah. Did I mention I met her
in the bar last night?

35:25.520 --> 35:27.640
- No.
- No, I didn't, did I?

35:27.680 --> 35:30.600
- Was she feeling better?
- Yeah, much better.

35:30.640 --> 35:33.040
She's not bad-Iooking, actually.

35:35.600 --> 35:36.800
Thank you.

35:36.840 --> 35:37.960
They're coming.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.240
What?

35:39.280 --> 35:41.280
Your American friend
and his wife.

35:44.560 --> 35:47.200
God. Just as long as he
doesn't park himself on us.

35:47.240 --> 35:48.560
After what he
told you last night?

35:48.600 --> 35:49.840
He wouldn't dare, would he?

35:49.880 --> 35:52.840
Nigel, old chap.
Good to see you.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.000
This must be
your lovely wife.

35:55.040 --> 35:58.080
Hi there, I'm Oscar. Mimi
you already know, don't you?

35:59.720 --> 36:01.320
So do you, Nigel, right?

36:02.480 --> 36:04.000
I hate to break up a twosome...

36:04.080 --> 36:05.640
but would you mind
if I joined you?

36:05.680 --> 36:08.040
We had an invitation
to the Captain's table.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.880
Trouble is,
I'm allergic to beards.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.720
Are you allergic to cripples?

36:13.280 --> 36:15.480
After an intro like that,
how can we refuse?

36:15.520 --> 36:16.920
Fine. It's settled, then.

36:16.960 --> 36:18.360
Off you go, baby.

36:18.400 --> 36:21.200
Thanks. Have fun.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.800
Mimi doesn't share my aversion.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.680
In fact,
she's not too choosy in general.

36:26.720 --> 36:28.960
Can't be, or she couldn't
have married me.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.640
What a girl.

36:33.680 --> 36:35.480
Knockin' 'em dead as usual.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.400
Just wine for me. White.

36:37.440 --> 36:40.880
Anything,
as long as it's not retsina.

36:40.920 --> 36:43.680
Yes, Mimi's very lovely,
but you...

36:43.720 --> 36:45.440
I still don't know your name,
by the way.

36:45.480 --> 36:46.560
Fiona.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.920
Fiona. I hope you won't
think me forward...

36:48.960 --> 36:51.920
but I find your own brand
of beauty more subtle.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.800
It has that inimitably
British quality...

36:53.840 --> 36:57.560
a kind of reticence that hints
at untapped potentiality.

36:57.600 --> 37:01.080
Nigel's been tapping
my potentialities for years...

37:01.120 --> 37:02.360
haven't you, Nigel?

37:02.400 --> 37:03.760
Well, Nigel?

37:05.280 --> 37:07.880
Come on, your lovely wife
has just implied...

37:07.920 --> 37:10.160
that she's lost
all her mystery for you.

37:10.200 --> 37:11.680
True or false?

37:11.720 --> 37:13.800
I think there's probably
a corner of everyone...

37:13.840 --> 37:14.960
that remains to be explored.

37:16.920 --> 37:20.040
Halfhearted,
but better than nothing.

37:20.080 --> 37:22.480
Well, Fiona, they'll
have to make do with that.

37:22.520 --> 37:26.240
He's right, though. Everyone
has secret nooks and crannies.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.200
Every relationship,
no matter how harmonious...

37:28.240 --> 37:31.120
contains seeds of farce
or tragedy.

37:38.120 --> 37:39.720
I do not like
the look of that sky.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.040
I'm not sure if the weather's
going to hold.

37:41.080 --> 37:43.840
Jesus, don't tell me you're
taking refuge in the weather.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.280
You know what I hope?

37:45.320 --> 37:46.680
I hope the ship goes down...

37:46.720 --> 37:48.640
and we're all marooned
on a desert island.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.160
I'd wind up
the sole survivor.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.160
That's charming.
And why do you say that?

37:52.240 --> 37:53.800
Because
no one would be tempted...

37:53.840 --> 37:56.040
to cannibalize
my shriveled carcass.

38:14.160 --> 38:16.360
I hope he hasn't
been boring you.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.840
No, not at all.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.520
Your husband
has a great sense of humor.

38:19.560 --> 38:21.960
Black humor, but still,
he's been keeping us...

38:22.000 --> 38:22.960
thoroughly entertained.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.880
- See, baby?
- See what?

38:24.880 --> 38:26.600
Our British friends
find me entertaining.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.720
In small doses, perhaps.

38:28.760 --> 38:31.360
But now we must leave them
in peace.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.560
Ah. Indeed.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.400
Thanks for taking care of him.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.320
Not at all.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.520
Ah, Fiona, I've already
imposed on you...

38:40.560 --> 38:42.400
but may I beg a favor?

38:42.440 --> 38:43.760
As I'm sure he told you...

38:43.800 --> 38:45.800
Nigel and I
had a chat last night.

38:45.840 --> 38:48.680
I found him
such stimulating company.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.800
Could I borrow him again
this afternoon?

38:50.840 --> 38:52.520
Just for an hour or so.

38:52.560 --> 38:55.080
He's quite grown up. He doesn't
have to have Mummy's permission.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.960
The seasons came and went.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.680
Mimi's face still held
a thousand mysteries for me...

39:12.720 --> 39:16.160
her body
a thousand sweet promises.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.120
But lurking
at the back of my mind...

39:18.160 --> 39:21.120
was an unspoken fear that we'd
already scaled the heights...

39:21.200 --> 39:22.880
of our relationship...

39:22.920 --> 39:25.760
that it would all be downhill
from now on.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.680
And then something happened.

39:29.480 --> 39:33.200
Something that would put things
on a totally different plane.

39:35.400 --> 39:39.080
We were at Kitzbuhel,
a skiing vacation.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.040
I'd rented a chalet there.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.280
It was one of those nights...

39:43.320 --> 39:45.720
warm and cozy inside...

39:45.760 --> 39:47.880
great, fat snowflakes...

39:47.920 --> 39:51.680
drifting down in the blackness
beyond the frosted panes.

39:51.720 --> 39:55.040
No light but the glow
from the set.

39:55.080 --> 39:57.760
Mimi on the floor wearing
a T-shirt and nothing else...

39:57.800 --> 40:02.080
watching some old American soap
dubbed in German...

40:02.160 --> 40:04.480
and me on the couch
watching her...

40:04.520 --> 40:07.360
sprawled in a sort
of boozy stupor.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.280
All at once she got up...

40:11.080 --> 40:13.800
stalked over to the set...

40:13.840 --> 40:16.520
spread her legs...

40:16.560 --> 40:18.560
and pissed on the screen...

40:18.600 --> 40:21.360
like she wanted to blot it out.

40:21.400 --> 40:25.360
Time stood still for an instant,
and then I rolled off the couch.

40:25.400 --> 40:27.440
I crawled over like a lunatic.

40:27.480 --> 40:29.760
I wormed my way
between her legs...

40:29.800 --> 40:31.640
and I turned over.

40:31.680 --> 40:32.800
And right away...

40:32.840 --> 40:38.120
I was engulfed with this warm,
golden cascade.

40:38.160 --> 40:40.480
It spattered my cheeks...

40:40.520 --> 40:43.280
it filled my nostrils,
it stung my eyes...

40:43.320 --> 40:46.320
and then something
jolted my brain...

40:46.360 --> 40:49.480
with multi-megavolt intensity.

40:49.520 --> 40:54.160
There was this blinding flash
in the back of my eyeballs.

40:54.200 --> 40:57.120
I experienced
the orgasm of a lifetime.

40:57.160 --> 40:59.080
For God's sake, man!

40:59.120 --> 41:02.520
It was like a white-hot blade
piercing me through and through.

41:02.560 --> 41:05.400
This was my Nile,
my Ganges, my Jordan...

41:05.440 --> 41:07.600
my Fountain of Youth,
my second baptism.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.960
I think I'm probably
as broad-minded...

41:10.000 --> 41:12.520
as the next man...
but, I mean, obviously...

41:12.560 --> 41:13.600
there are limits.

41:13.640 --> 41:15.040
Stop twittering, Nigel.

41:15.120 --> 41:18.400
I'm sharing a revelation
with you, damn it.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.800
I'm trying to expand
your sexual horizons.

41:20.840 --> 41:22.800
I see. And what makes you
think they need expanding?

41:22.840 --> 41:27.080
I'm sure your tumbles with Fiona
are all perfectly adequate...

41:27.120 --> 41:29.360
very sanitary and hygienic
in their way.

41:29.400 --> 41:32.200
You bloody well
leave us out of this.

41:32.200 --> 41:34.240
At least we've got some decency.

41:34.280 --> 41:36.200
What do you think
you're doing...

41:36.200 --> 41:39.080
sharing the details
of your perverted sex life...

41:39.120 --> 41:40.440
with a total stranger?

41:40.480 --> 41:41.840
It's just downright obscene.

41:41.880 --> 41:43.000
Obscene?

41:43.040 --> 41:46.280
Have you ever felt real,
overpowering passion?

41:46.320 --> 41:48.960
Have you ever truly
idolized a woman?

41:49.000 --> 41:51.560
Nothing can be obscene
in such a love.

41:51.560 --> 41:53.600
Everything that occurs
between you...

41:53.640 --> 41:55.840
becomes a sacrament,
don't you see?

41:57.840 --> 41:59.160
Come on. Sit down.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.480
Have another cup of tea.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.080
It'll steady your nerves.

42:05.920 --> 42:09.280
So, anyway...

42:09.360 --> 42:12.040
that was our sexual Rubicon.

42:12.080 --> 42:15.520
It opened up all sorts
of new possibilities.

42:54.880 --> 42:57.000
I always had a suspicion...

42:57.040 --> 42:59.080
it might be
supremely pleasurable...

42:59.120 --> 43:03.400
to be humiliated
by a beautiful woman...

43:03.440 --> 43:06.520
but it was only now
I realized...

43:06.560 --> 43:08.680
what this could entail.

45:10.040 --> 45:14.160
We shut ourselves up with
our toys for weeks on end...

45:14.200 --> 45:15.760
never going out...

45:15.800 --> 45:18.440
seeing no one but each other.

45:18.480 --> 45:21.520
I guess it was asking
too much of any couple.

45:21.560 --> 45:22.680
Oscar?

45:22.720 --> 45:23.880
Just a minute.

45:25.040 --> 45:27.640
Did you really have
all those women?

45:27.680 --> 45:29.200
What women?

45:29.240 --> 45:31.200
The ones you write about.

45:33.560 --> 45:34.960
Does it matter?

45:35.000 --> 45:36.880
It's a book, for Christ's sake.

45:36.920 --> 45:38.320
I know. I'm just curious.

45:38.360 --> 45:41.200
Do you like it?
That's what matters.

45:41.240 --> 45:43.040
It's very sexy.

45:43.080 --> 45:45.960
Forget about sex
for two seconds.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.280
What do you think of the quality
of the writing?

45:48.320 --> 45:51.240
I can't judge.
My English isn't good enough.

45:51.280 --> 45:53.160
"My English isn't good enough."

45:53.200 --> 45:55.080
Why read the fucking book
at all?

45:55.120 --> 45:56.520
Because I love you.

45:56.520 --> 45:59.000
Because I love everything
to do with you.

45:59.040 --> 46:01.320
It's a pity
you're not in publishing.

46:01.360 --> 46:04.640
I'd be at the top
of the best-seller list by now.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.800
When will it be published?

46:06.840 --> 46:08.200
You tell me.

46:09.320 --> 46:11.320
I'm working on it.

46:11.360 --> 46:14.920
We were getting to be
like two goldfish in a bowl.

46:14.960 --> 46:17.920
"Come on," I told her,
"We need a change of scene.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.840
"Let's each round up
a few friends and hit the town."

46:48.760 --> 46:52.880
You know it.
It's true. It's true.

48:03.120 --> 48:04.560
Hey, what's the matter?

48:09.440 --> 48:11.320
I'd always found infidelity...

48:11.360 --> 48:15.040
the most titillating aspect
of any relationship.

48:15.080 --> 48:18.280
That scene
should have turned me on.

48:18.320 --> 48:21.160
So why didn't it?

48:21.200 --> 48:23.320
Why did I feel so hurt?

48:25.160 --> 48:27.600
Pas de cigarette,
s'il vous plait.

48:53.320 --> 48:55.360
Why did you do it?

48:59.440 --> 49:02.040
Why don't you say something?

49:02.080 --> 49:03.520
What do you want me to say?

49:03.560 --> 49:06.440
Why did you walk out on me
like that?

49:06.480 --> 49:07.880
You don't know?

49:07.920 --> 49:09.640
Well, you started it.

49:09.680 --> 49:12.080
Flirting with my own roommate.

49:12.120 --> 49:13.680
You were all over her.

49:13.720 --> 49:15.880
Bullshit. We were having
a couple laughs.

49:15.920 --> 49:17.320
And we were just having a dance.

49:17.360 --> 49:21.320
Some dance. Decent of you
not to fuck him on the floor.

49:21.360 --> 49:24.520
I'm sorry.
I did it because I was jealous.

49:24.520 --> 49:26.600
Please, please forgive me.

49:26.640 --> 49:28.040
You're my Tiger.

49:28.080 --> 49:30.760
I don't want anyone but you...

49:30.800 --> 49:32.520
not ever.

49:32.560 --> 49:36.240
I love you. I love you.

49:36.280 --> 49:40.600
I loved her, too,
but our credit was running out.

49:40.640 --> 49:43.320
We were headed
for sexual bankruptcy.

49:56.080 --> 49:58.440
I smell pig.

50:02.600 --> 50:03.680
Don't laugh.

50:03.720 --> 50:05.200
Don't talk.

50:05.240 --> 50:07.880
Come, piggy.

50:07.920 --> 50:09.920
Where is he?

50:09.960 --> 50:12.320
Come, piggy-wiggy.

50:13.840 --> 50:15.680
Where are you?

50:27.880 --> 50:30.120
Get off. Get off.

50:31.400 --> 50:35.560
How dare you try to fuck me,
you filthy beast!

50:35.600 --> 50:36.680
Take that.

50:42.520 --> 50:43.760
Harder.

50:43.800 --> 50:44.920
Shut up.

50:47.160 --> 50:49.720
Oh, you spoiled it.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.400
Pigs don't talk.

50:52.440 --> 50:55.000
How can I believe
in a pig that talks?

51:00.280 --> 51:01.720
You know something?

51:03.480 --> 51:05.880
I don't believe in it, either.

51:07.320 --> 51:08.760
Not anymore.

51:17.360 --> 51:18.920
That was it.

51:18.960 --> 51:21.040
The spell was broken at last.

51:21.080 --> 51:23.720
Jolly good thing, too,
if you ask me.

51:23.760 --> 51:25.800
I dread to think
what you'd get up to next.

51:25.840 --> 51:29.200
Don't worry.
There's plenty more to tell.

51:29.240 --> 51:31.400
What makes you think
I want to hear it?

51:31.440 --> 51:33.480
I still don't know
what gives you the idea...

51:33.480 --> 51:35.400
that I enjoy being used
as a rubbish dump...

51:35.440 --> 51:36.680
for your unsavory reminiscences.

51:36.720 --> 51:38.880
Don't you?

51:38.920 --> 51:40.720
Don't you really, Nigel?

51:44.560 --> 51:46.120
He's still here?

51:46.160 --> 51:50.760
Afraid I am, yes,
but I'm just off now.

51:50.800 --> 51:55.080
You know, Nigel has been
extremely patient with me.

51:55.120 --> 51:58.800
We don't see eye-to-eye
on everything...

51:58.840 --> 52:01.960
but we share at least
one interest in common...

52:02.000 --> 52:03.360
you, baby.

52:03.400 --> 52:07.920
I suppose that's why he
keeps coming back for more.

52:07.960 --> 52:10.640
Anyway, as I say, I'm just off.

52:10.680 --> 52:12.920
So, thanks very much
for the tea.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.120
Toodle-oo.

52:33.120 --> 52:34.200
Oh. Sorry.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.960
You were gone long enough.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.400
I'm really sorry, darling.

52:37.440 --> 52:39.320
I was going to go to dinner
without you.

52:39.360 --> 52:41.080
It's just incredibly hard
to get away.

52:41.120 --> 52:42.760
You saw what he's like.

52:42.800 --> 52:45.680
- Was she there, too?
- Who?

52:45.720 --> 52:46.800
Wrong answer, Nigel.

52:46.840 --> 52:49.080
"Yes" or "no" would have
been fine, but "who?"

52:49.120 --> 52:51.040
You know perfectly well
who I mean.

52:51.080 --> 52:55.280
Right, Mimi. Yeah, she rolled up
just as I was leaving.

52:55.320 --> 52:56.440
Odd creature.

52:56.480 --> 52:59.000
So you said...
"Odd, but not bad-Iooking."

52:59.040 --> 53:00.440
Most men would find her
stunning.

53:00.480 --> 53:01.920
Most women, too,
for that matter.

53:01.960 --> 53:05.240
Well, look, I am not "most men."

53:05.280 --> 53:08.600
I'm your husband. Right?

53:08.640 --> 53:10.040
There we go.

53:10.080 --> 53:13.160
Here they are, all locked up.

53:13.200 --> 53:14.840
I say,
is this your little girl?

53:14.880 --> 53:17.240
It is, indeed. Amrita, say hello
to the lady and gentleman.

53:17.280 --> 53:18.680
Hello, Amrita.
That's a very pretty name.

53:18.720 --> 53:20.200
It's almost as pretty
as you are.

53:20.240 --> 53:23.000
She's enchanting.
Where have you been hiding her?

53:23.040 --> 53:24.920
I have a nanny
that looks after her.

53:24.960 --> 53:27.560
- And your wife?
- I'm a widower, dear lady.

53:27.600 --> 53:29.520
Oh, I'm so sorry.

53:29.520 --> 53:32.040
Anyway, it's lovely
to have a child on board.

53:32.080 --> 53:34.440
It makes a change
from all the wrinklies.

53:34.480 --> 53:37.320
And you? Have you provided
for your posterity?

53:37.360 --> 53:38.440
Sorry?

53:38.480 --> 53:40.280
You have a wife
that loves children so much.

53:40.320 --> 53:42.440
I was just wondering if
you yourself have a family.

53:42.480 --> 53:44.200
No, we haven't, actually.

53:44.240 --> 53:46.600
No. Nigel thinks the world's
overpopulated enough as it is...

53:46.640 --> 53:49.000
without us adding
to the problem.

53:49.040 --> 53:51.400
An admirable sentiment in India,
perhaps...

53:51.440 --> 53:53.360
But surely the green fields
of England...

53:53.400 --> 53:56.200
can afford to have
a few more mouths to feed.

53:56.240 --> 53:57.960
I say, look at that.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.400
Oh, look, Amrita, look. See.

53:59.440 --> 54:01.640
- Isn't that beautiful?
- Are you cold, darling?

54:01.680 --> 54:04.040
Gosh,
I should have brought my coat.

54:04.080 --> 54:06.280
Please, allow me.

54:06.320 --> 54:07.560
That's very kind.

54:07.600 --> 54:09.040
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

54:10.320 --> 54:12.560
Let's go and I'll fetch you
something from the cabin.

54:12.600 --> 54:14.200
See you in a sec.

54:15.880 --> 54:17.640
Believe me, dear lady...

54:17.640 --> 54:20.200
children are a better
form of marital therapy...

54:20.200 --> 54:21.800
than any trip to India.

54:34.280 --> 54:36.520
You mustn't believe all he says.

54:36.560 --> 54:38.440
He's a sick man.

54:38.480 --> 54:39.880
He imagines things.

54:44.200 --> 54:46.760
Please, don't think badly of me.

54:48.680 --> 54:50.000
Now, wait a minute.

54:50.040 --> 54:52.240
What are you playing at
this time?

54:52.280 --> 54:55.600
It matters to me what you think.

54:55.640 --> 54:56.840
Does it?

54:58.200 --> 54:59.600
Does it really?

54:59.640 --> 55:02.000
I have to talk with you, Nigel.

55:02.040 --> 55:04.040
I have to explain.

55:05.320 --> 55:07.560
All right, go ahead.

55:07.600 --> 55:09.000
No. Not here.

55:09.040 --> 55:10.440
In my cabin.

55:10.480 --> 55:13.480
We won't be disturbed there.

55:13.520 --> 55:14.640
Please.

55:14.680 --> 55:18.760
I'm afraid I can't. Not now.

55:18.800 --> 55:20.360
No. Later.

55:20.400 --> 55:22.400
Five o'clock.

55:22.440 --> 55:24.320
Cabin DS1.

55:36.760 --> 55:38.680
What is it?

55:41.560 --> 55:42.840
A newspaper.

55:43.960 --> 55:45.360
I brought your coat.

55:45.400 --> 55:46.800
Thanks, Mr. Singh.

55:46.840 --> 55:48.000
You're very welcome.

55:50.280 --> 55:52.400
- What a lovely story.
- Thanks.

55:52.440 --> 55:53.920
Say thank you, Amrita.

55:53.960 --> 55:55.600
So if your daddy will let me
I'll come and tell you...

55:55.640 --> 55:58.360
some other stories sometime.
Would you like that?

55:59.400 --> 56:01.200
Two hearts.

56:01.240 --> 56:03.000
I pass.

56:04.440 --> 56:06.000
Four hearts.

56:06.040 --> 56:07.440
Ich passe.

56:07.480 --> 56:08.560
No bid.

56:08.600 --> 56:09.720
Pass.

56:30.760 --> 56:32.200
You won't believe this...

56:32.240 --> 56:34.920
but I've got to see
that chap again.

56:34.920 --> 56:37.320
I thought you'd had enough
of all that.

56:37.360 --> 56:41.480
I know, it's just...
he won't take no for an answer.

56:41.520 --> 56:44.800
I'm so sorry,
but I've simply got to go.

56:44.880 --> 56:48.000
I wonder, would you like
to take my place?

56:48.040 --> 56:49.880
- I should be delighted.
- Great.

56:49.920 --> 56:51.720
Bridge is king of games.

56:51.720 --> 56:54.600
I once played
forty-eight hours nonstop.

56:54.640 --> 56:57.000
You leave your partner
in safe hands.

56:57.040 --> 56:58.440
Excellent.
I do apologize.

56:58.480 --> 56:59.880
Please, excuse me.

56:59.880 --> 57:01.800
Entschuldigung and all that.

57:37.560 --> 57:39.000
May I come in?

57:46.680 --> 57:48.520
Close the door.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.160
April Fool!

58:17.360 --> 58:19.680
You pathetic, sick...

58:22.520 --> 58:24.480
Do you want her?

58:24.560 --> 58:26.120
Yes or no.

58:26.160 --> 58:29.080
I don't want anything more to do
with either of you, ever.

58:29.120 --> 58:31.520
Let go.
Let me go, or I'Il...

58:31.560 --> 58:34.440
Let me go
or I'll call my mommy.

58:34.480 --> 58:36.840
Go on.

58:36.880 --> 58:38.600
Get out.

58:38.640 --> 58:41.360
Crawl back
to your matrimonial tomb.

58:47.280 --> 58:49.640
You know what? I pity you.

58:49.680 --> 58:51.560
I genuinely pity you both...

58:51.560 --> 58:53.880
if this is how
you get your kicks.

58:53.920 --> 58:56.320
I get no kicks out of this.

58:56.400 --> 58:58.200
Then what was this farce?

58:58.240 --> 59:00.640
How else could we get you here?

59:03.520 --> 59:06.840
Why is that suddenly
of such incredible importance?

59:06.880 --> 59:10.120
Mimi wants you to hear
the rest of our story.

59:10.160 --> 59:13.120
She thinks it'll help
her chances with you.

59:13.160 --> 59:15.240
What are you, her pimp?

59:15.280 --> 59:17.600
I don't begrudge Mimi
the right to look elsewhere...

59:17.640 --> 59:20.520
for what I can no longer supply.

59:20.560 --> 59:23.880
I merely supervise her affairs
instead of...

59:23.920 --> 59:25.320
submitting to them.

59:26.960 --> 59:29.160
You can have her, Nigel...

59:29.200 --> 59:30.600
with my blessings.

59:30.640 --> 59:33.320
On one condition...

59:33.320 --> 59:34.600
you hear me out.

59:39.760 --> 59:41.320
You make me sick.

59:41.360 --> 59:43.280
Why are you still standing here?

59:44.720 --> 59:48.000
Come on, Nigel, it was a joke.

59:48.040 --> 59:51.040
Have a sense of humor,
for Christ's sake.

59:51.080 --> 59:52.320
Come on, sit down.

59:52.360 --> 59:53.840
Make yourself comfortable.

59:53.880 --> 59:55.080
Use my wheelchair.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.600
The brake! The brake!

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.520
Have a heart, Nigel.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.800
Don't be too rough...

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.400
on a man demolished
by a love that was too strong.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.280
Yes, sir.

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.640
We should have
stopped right there.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:37.560
Lovers should quit when
their passion is at its peak...

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.800
not wait until
its inevitable decline.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.080
As it was, my desire for her
had begun to wane.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.760
There she would lie...

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.840
gorgeous, voluptuous...

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.760
and it didn't do a thing for me.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.560
I came to resent her failure
to excite me...

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.160
the way she used to.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:16.480
We were developing a narcotic
dependence on television...

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:20.120
the marital aid that enables
a couple to endure each other...

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.400
without having to talk.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.440
A New York editress
was overnighting in Paris...

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.440
on her way
to the Frankfurt book fair.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.960
I wanted to show her
a good time.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.560
It was a PR job...

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.440
and I was apprehensive
of her reaction to Mimi...

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:47.600
who tended to upstage
every other woman in sight.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:48.760
You wearing that?

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.840
That dress?

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.160
What about it?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.520
Couldn't you wear
something else?

01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.480
What's wrong with it?

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.360
Oh, nothing.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.120
What do you mean, nothing?

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.920
You think it makes me look fat,
it makes my ass look fat.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.520
Did I say that?

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.920
- You think I've got a fat ass.
- You said that. I didn't.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.320
So you do think
I've got a fat ass.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.000
Give me a break.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.840
You wouldn't have said that
once upon a time.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.120
You liked my ass.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:26.160
I still like your ass.
I'm crazy about your ass.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.720
You don't love me anymore.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.720
Wear what you fucking want.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.560
Wear a fucking bathrobe,
for all I care.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.080
The trouble is, publishing
isn't what it used to be.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.960
It's the bottom line
that counts now...

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.680
proven track records,
advance sales.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.840
No one's gonna invest
in a newcomer...

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.040
who hasn't proven himself.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.000
So an unknown can't get
published unless he's known.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.760
Sounds like a Catch-22 to me.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.520
You could call it that.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.600
And your Parisian settings
don't help any.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.000
When are you
going to come back home...

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.440
back to the United States,
where it's at?

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.880
No, he wouldn't do that.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.440
Oscar's a fixture here.
He's like the Eiffel Tower.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.640
He's right, Beverly.
I love it here.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.000
- I feel at home.
- Good for you.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.960
Come on, get a life.
Paris is out. Vieux jeu.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.360
It's a literary mausoleum.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.320
Henry Miller
used it up fifty years ago.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.840
God, I don't think France
hasn't been the same...

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:21.120
since they gave up absinthe.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.440
It's all right.
I'll be fine. Thank you.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.560
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.520
You know what?
I should make you my agent.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.520
That would solve
all my problems.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.600
"Paris is out. Vieux jeu."

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.760
You really did me
some good tonight...

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.720
like I don't have enough trouble
getting published.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.800
I couldn't bear to see you
crawl up her ass like that.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.320
I'll crawl up the ass of anyone
I fucking well feel like.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.800
Yours isn't the only one
in town.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.920
Is that how you feel?

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.320
That's exactly how I feel.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.240
In that case, I'd better go.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.840
OK. You do that.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.760
I'm going now.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.160
Are you sad I'm going?

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.080
You're not sad.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.840
I am sad,
but it's better this way.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.760
My keys.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.920
Thanks.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.560
I love you.
I love you so much.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.640
Please don't make me go.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.280
Stop crying.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.600
Go make some coffee
or something, huh?

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.400
I came to dread bedtime.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.120
I would feel this...

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:07.080
overpowering desire to sleep.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.240
I'm bushed.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.680
I'd feel sorry for her...

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.120
Good night.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.160
...lying there with her belly
crying, "Famine..."

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.600
her organs in turmoil.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.240
Kiss me good night.

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.760
Not like that. Hold me.

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.800
I would crush my lips
against hers...

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.160
like you mash out a butt
in an ashtray...

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.680
but that was only a prelude...

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.640
to the most unoriginal act
known to man...

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.920
the process referred to
as copulation.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:05.280
I felt like a rat in a trap.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:08.040
Out there,
people were having fun...

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.960
dancing, making love.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Paris was throbbing
to its own frenetic rhythms.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:17.160
They pounded away in my head,
driving me crazy.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.880
I craved variety.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:23.120
I hungered for noise
and excitement.

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.120
Holy shit!

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.520
Do you have to drink it
that way?

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.760
Why can't you use a glass?

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:29.160
What's the difference?
It tastes the same.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:31.080
It doesn't look the same.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.640
Oh-la-la. I didn't know
you were so delicate.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.160
- What do you mean, delicate?
- I mean delicate.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.279
I know what you mean...

01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:38.920
but it's just not
the right word in English.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:41.160
If you don't know the right word
in English, say it in French.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.040
I don't say it in French because
your French isn't good enough.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.240
It's better than your English.

01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:50.040
After all these years in Paris,
so it should be.

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.399
Maybe your English
isn't that good, either.

01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:55.840
Maybe that's why no one wants
to publish your books.

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.800
So now you're a literary critic?

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.640
That's great
coming from a waitress.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.279
I'm not a waitress.
I'm a dancer.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:04.640
Dancer, hell.
You'd still be begging tips...

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.520
if I hadn't picked you up
out of that fucking restaurant.

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:17.160
You little bitch!

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.439
OK, show's over.

01:09:24.479 --> 01:09:26.399
You can get up now.

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.840
Jesus, don't do this to me.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:45.960
Baby?

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.359
Come on, say something.

01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:48.479
Please.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.160
God Almighty.

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.600
Sos médecin. Bonjour.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.960
Ma femme, elle est évanouie
soudainement.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.400
Dans quelles circonstances?

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.680
Elle est tombée. Tombée.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.840
Sa tete a heurte un meuble.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.080
Saigne-t-elle due nez
ou des oreilles?

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.320
Est-ce qu'elle prend
des médicaments?

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.560
Quel age a-t-elle?

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.960
- J'ai mal.
- Where?

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.200
Ou tu as mal?

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.560
My head.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.360
Is it bad?

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.320
How bad is it?

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.080
Tiger.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:02.960
- Should I call a doctor?
- No. Just hold me.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:11.000
Baby, forgive me, please.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.840
I love you.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.160
Wow. It's great!

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.560
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm so happy.

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.160
What a lovely evening.

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.560
I wish it would last forever.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.040
Forever's a long time, baby.

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.280
I can't think in those terms.

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.400
I never could.

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.320
But when something is good...

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.720
don't you want it
to last forever?

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:05.320
Sure, but good things never do.

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:06.760
Not even us?

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:11.000
Are we so good?

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.200
Aren't we?

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:16.880
Well, now that you
come to mention it, no.

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.400
Not anymore.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.640
I...

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:27.720
Come on, Mimi,
let's stop kidding ourselves.

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.800
I don't understand.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.000
Look,
it was sweet while it lasted.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.480
Boy, it was sweet,
but it's going sour, isn't it?

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.400
Well, isn't it?

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.000
I'd been hoping that you'd
take the initiative...

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:48.680
but, no, you seem quite happy
to let things drag on this way.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.040
Well, I'm not.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.200
I'm degrading myself
by degrading you.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.680
We're degrading each other,
for God's sake.

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.040
Let's not spoil
a beautiful memory.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:02.480
Let's quit while we still have
a few shreds of dignity left.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.800
But I love you.
All I want is you.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:11.560
I want to marry you.
I want to give you babies.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.640
I want to give you
the rest of my life.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.160
I don't want the rest
of your life. I want my own.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.600
Can't you get it
through your head?

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:21.640
What did I do wrong?

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.600
Did I ever harm you?

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:27.080
Oscar, tell me.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.200
Even a criminal
is told his crime.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.520
What did I do?

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.040
You didn't do anything.

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:40.160
You exist.

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.360
That's all.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.720
I understand.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.400
Did I miss her?

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.400
Sure, I did...

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:20.560
but I also experienced
an incredible sense of freedom.

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.960
The future seemed bright
with promise...

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.040
peopled with a thousand
alluring images...

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.840
most of them female.

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.600
Oh, shit.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.400
It's me.

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.040
I'm here.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.160
I'm scared.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:51.280
What?

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.040
I can't live without you.

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.960
I'm afraid
you're just gonna have to.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.080
I won't.

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.720
We've been through this before,
haven't we?

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:02.280
So why don't we give it a rest?

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:05.520
Look up some friends.
Have some fun.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:07.760
We just went over the top,
that's all.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:09.040
In a few days...

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.640
you'll be grateful to me
for having made the first move.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:22.200
Was she play-acting?

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.480
I couldn't be sure.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.760
I called her old roommate.

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:27.600
No dice.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.800
I spent the rest of the day
wondering...

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.080
and half the night drinking.

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.200
I was waiting for you.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.600
I can see that. I wonder why.

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.720
You know why.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.840
I know I'm wrecked
and I'm gonna crash.

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.240
- No. Wait.
- Let go of me.

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.440
I want to tell you something.

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.920
There's nothing more to be said.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.000
- Please!

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.320
It's not going to make it
any easier on you.

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:11.200
You've got to listen to me.
Please. Please listen to me.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:12.840
Oh, for God's sake.

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:17.800
Rita, veux-tu. Rita.

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.640
All right. You'd better come in.

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.920
Do you want one?

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.840
All right.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.560
What's so important?

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.520
It's true what I said.

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.560
I can't live without you.

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.480
If that's all you came
to tell me...

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.360
Please, don't throw me out.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.480
Give me one last chance.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.200
I'm ready to live with you
on any terms, any at all.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.720
I can bear anything as long
as I'm with you sometimes.

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.680
You can shout at me.

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:17.160
You can hit me.

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.080
You can have other women.

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:22.360
I don't care what you do,
but, please...

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.000
don't send me away.

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:29.480
Even if you don't
love me anymore...

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.880
keep me with you out of pity.

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.960
There's nothing I wouldn't do
to stay with you.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.120
Please. Please.

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.760
Please.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.600
I beg you.

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:46.440
Please! Please!

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:48.640
I beg you.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.320
Everyone has a sadistic streak.

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.920
Nothing brings it out better...

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.320
than the knowledge you've got
someone at your mercy.

01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:00.320
If she really fancied
living in a living hell...

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.960
I'd make it so hot,
even she would want out.

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:09.520
Yeah, it feels so good.

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.800
Yeah, it does, Cindy.

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:16.160
Cindy?

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.040
I mean Minnie, uh, Mimi.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.440
Sure, I'm on.

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:03.680
Yeah, why not?

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:08.520
Round up a couple of chicks.
We'll make a night of it.

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.320
Who?

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:11.520
Oh, you bet.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:14.280
She's the best piece of ass
this side of the river.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.400
All right.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.080
Yeah, I'll see you there.

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:24.840
Dinner's ready.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:26.720
I'm eating out.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:27.840
Tonight?

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.640
What's so special about tonight?

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.920
It's your holiday.

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.400
What holiday?

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.080
Thanksgiving.

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.800
I wanted to surprise you.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:39.080
All right.
Let's see what you got.

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.160
Christ, what is that?

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.000
Turkey.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:54.920
I cooked it for you special.

01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.880
Cremated it, you mean.

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:04.040
That's it. I'm off.

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:06.360
Won't you even try a little?

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.480
You're joking.

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.400
I have too much respect
for my dentist.

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.680
Listen, in the future,
forget about cooking.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.520
Stick to what you can do.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.080
Which reminds me, what happened
to your dance classes?

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:20.000
Dancing has to come
from the heart.

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:20.640
So?

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.040
My heart is broken.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.600
I was getting to her at last.

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:35.040
I'd achieved the impossible.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.440
She was losing her looks
and her figure...

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.960
wasting away...

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.600
breaking out
in nervous rashes...

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.280
developing spots.

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:52.080
We were just admiring
your new hairstyle.

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.320
Really?

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:56.560
Susan here thinks it suits you.
I do, too.

01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:00.440
I can't put my finger on it,
but it reminds me of something.

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.000
I know! Rita!

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.520
Rita?

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.080
You know Rita.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.120
Rita. The neighbor's dog.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.080
Just a minute. Wait.

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:15.440
What's that?
Looks like a zit.

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.000
It is.

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.880
And your nose is shiny, too.

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:23.240
I'm not a makeup artist,
but I could do better than that.

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:55.080
Hey! I didn't know we were
having a Halloween party.

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.320
She was so easy to hurt...

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:05.360
it was getting to be
like shooting fish in a barrel.

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:18.200
Not now, for Christ's sake!

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.600
Can't you see that
I'm trying to work?

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:26.640
Anyway, have I ever asked you
to clean the house for me?

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:29.480
No. So stop playing the martyr.

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.400
Take that thing off your head.

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:34.840
It makes you look
even uglier than usual.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.160
You're really
letting yourself go.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:39.200
I'm ashamed to be seen going
around with you these days.

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:48.520
What is it now?

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:54.320
I expect...

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.920
What do you expect?

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:05.080
A baby.

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.960
What did you say?

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.880
I'm going to have a baby.

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.440
Oh, my God.

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.840
How long have you known?

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.000
Only since yesterday.

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.800
Two months, the doctor says.

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:42.360
What are you going
to do about it?

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.240
Do about it?

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.880
Look at me.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.040
Do I look like a daddy?

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:58.560
Can you see us bringing up
a child in this place?

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.480
I'm pushing forty.

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:04.840
I haven't even sold
a single book yet.

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:06.840
The world doesn't know I exist.

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.920
Not a day goes by that I don't
think it might be better...

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:14.160
just to kill myself
and be done with it.

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:32.520
Would it be fair to saddle
a child with a father like this?

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.320
Be honest.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.560
They'd told me
there were complications...

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.840
but I wasn't prepared...

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:10.960
to see her looking
like a marble figure on a tomb.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.160
For a moment, I almost weakened.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.280
You came.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:19.680
Why wouldn't I?

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:23.760
I brought you flowers.

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:33.560
You're here.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.040
Nothing else matters.

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:46.760
I've been thinking,
that when you're on your feet...

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:50.200
we'll go away together,
just the two of us.

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:51.360
Go away?

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.200
Yeah. Far, far away.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:04.560
Shit. No room.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.320
You look pale, baby.

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:09.760
Feeling all right?

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:10.920
Pardon, madame.

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.600
Excuse me.

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.440
Oh, pardon. Je m'excuse.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.000
Look. There it is.

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:32.680
That's what you need, baby.

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.880
I can just see you luxuriating
under one of them palms...

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:37.960
with a tall glass in your hand.

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.080
Oh, hell, I can't sit through
the whole trip this way.

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:46.040
I'm gonna get them
to stow it somewhere.

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:48.360
I'll be right back.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.880
Your baggage
has already been loaded...

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.520
and it can't travel without you.

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:07.480
No. This is all I've got.

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:10.760
Vous n'avez pas de bagage
dans la soute?

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.760
May I see your ticket, please?

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:18.840
Voulez-vous que
je fasse une annonce...

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:21.240
pour savoir s'il
y a un médecin à bord?

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:26.040
I shall have to check
with the Captain.

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.400
I could picture her
looking out the window...

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:16.640
at that beautiful moon...

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:18.960
the same one I could see...

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.800
but I bet it didn't look
the same to her.

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.600
Depends on your state of mind,
the way things grab you.

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:29.240
To her,
it must have been poison.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.600
To me, sweet as a peach.

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:36.200
I don't know about you.

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.360
Sometimes I think you make
things up as you go along.

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.800
I wish you were right.

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:43.320
My imagination
isn't half that fertile.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.720
I might have made it
into print after all.

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:49.080
I mean, if even half
that story were true...

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.720
you'd be too bloody ashamed
to tell it.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.480
Boy...

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:59.320
you still don't know me at all.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.920
Are you still angry with me?

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.160
I don't know. I'm confused.

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:27.520
I wanted you to hear it.

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:34.480
I'd sooner have heard it
from you.

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:37.880
I leave the words to him.
They're all he has left.

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:11.080
When can we be alone together?

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:13.920
I mean, you know, really alone.

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:16.120
First hear the rest
of the story.

01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:19.960
Then we'll see.

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.920
Here you are.
I wondered where you were.

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:12.520
You missed dinner.

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:15.400
I completely lost track of time.
I'm really sorry.

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.600
Never mind.
Dado's been keeping me company.

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:19.520
Good. How did the bridge go?

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:22.040
- It was a disaster.
- Really.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.840
We had very, very bad luck.

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:27.600
Never had such terrible hands
in my entire life.

01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:30.920
Never mind, Dado.
Unlucky at cards, lucky in love.

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:33.040
May I offer you a drink?

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:35.760
No, thanks very much.
I think some other time.

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:37.080
Are you coming, darling?

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.640
Smarmy bugger.

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:50.080
I bet he'd like
to climb inside your pants.

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.680
You can talk.

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.440
What do you mean?

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:56.320
Oh, God, Nigel,
I'm not a complete fool.

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.200
Those sessions
with that American freak.

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:00.800
I know what the attraction is.
It isn't his big blue eyes.

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:02.400
I'm sorry. I don't follow.

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.560
It's his wife you're after.

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.240
You've got the hots
for her, haven't you?

01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:08.280
What? I feel sorry for the girl,
that's all.

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:12.120
Yeah, so sorry that
your tongue's hanging out.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.720
Now, just watch it, Nigel.

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:18.320
Anything you can do,
I can do better.

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.520
Oh, God.

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:43.640
Darling, I cannot understand
why you won't take a Dramamine.

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:45.520
I told you, they knock me out.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:49.800
Surely, now, it's better
to sleep than to suffer.

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:51.440
We look forward
to welcoming you...

01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:53.000
to our gala fancy
dress ball tonight.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.120
I'll be all right.

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:57.000
See the new year in
and dance till dawn...

01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:59.880
to the music of
Danny Garcy and his boys.

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:01.320
For those without costumes...

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.240
the stewards can supply
funny hats and...

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:05.240
Funny hats.
For God's sake.

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.440
Here.

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:13.120
Here, take another.

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:22.480
You like me taking pills,
don't you, Nigel?

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:24.600
If it's not one kind,
it's another.

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:26.320
Don't know why I bother.

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:28.000
Sorry, darling.
What are you talking about?

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:31.000
The pill, Nigel. The pill.

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:34.200
We don't do it often enough
nowadays to make it worthwhile.

01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:36.160
Oh, really. Come on, please.

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.600
What are we doing here?

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:40.920
What are we looking for
that we can't find at home?

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:43.360
Seven years.
Look where it got us.

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.680
I realize something now.
We shouldn't go to India at all.

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:48.160
I'll be spending
the whole six months in bed.

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:50.400
Sorry, darling.
I'm not with you.

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:51.920
Too right, you're not.
You're somewhere bloody else...

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:52.880
and I know where!

01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.240
It's like a drug.

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:57.040
Actually,
That's all getting very boring.

01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:58.400
If you're so obsessed...

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:01.360
with your dirty-minded little
cripple and his sexy wife...

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:02.800
why don't you just go back
for another helping...

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:03.800
and leave me in peace.

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:06.400
Fine! If that's how you feel,
I damn well will.

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:23.600
In time, Mimi became
a distant memory...

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:26.080
a closed chapter.

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:29.280
My sense of freedom returned
with a vengeance.

01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:34.600
I hadn't dumped Mimi
for one particular woman.

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:37.120
I'd swapped her
for all womankind.

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:41.240
And I resolved
to make up for lost time.

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:51.240
No more emotional entanglements.

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.640
I just wallowed in female flesh
like a pig in clover...

01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:58.400
ricocheted from bed to bed...

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.320
grabbed whatever was going...

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:01.920
hurried on.

01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:06.040
Every day held the promise...

01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:09.320
of some new, short-lived
sexual experience...

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:10.960
the shorter, the better.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Every time I looked
into one woman's eyes...

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.680
I could see the reflection
of the next.

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:36.720
After two years
of screwing around...

01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:38.760
I gave up all pretense
of writing...

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.640
and turned night into day.

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:41.760
Like Dracula...

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:46.280
I rose at dusk
and retired to my pad at dawn.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:06.080
Il faut qu'je rentre.
Il faut que je rentre, Oscar.

01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:09.840
Mais non, on s'amuser.
The night is young.

01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:12.440
Moi, il fatigué.
Je me lève dans deux heures.

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:14.880
Arrete tes couneries.
On va rigoler un peu.

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:17.720
Non! Arrete!

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:32.120
Something's fucked up.

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:39.480
I was luckier than I deserved.

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.760
Just a concussion
and a fractured femur...

01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:45.880
that had kept me lying there
like a mummy for weeks.

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:47.160
None of my conquests...

01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:50.000
bothered to check
if I was still breathing.

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.480
Well, I'll be damned.

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:08.520
Jesus.

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:10.680
So you didn't kill yourself.

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:12.000
What for?

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:13.920
I was dead already.

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:15.640
You're looking great anyway.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.280
I'm feeling great.

01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:19.960
Here. I brought you these.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.120
Thanks.

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:26.280
May as well sit down
while you're here.

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.960
Where you been all this time?

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.760
You bought the tickets.
You should know.

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.480
Martinique? You stayed on?

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.240
What have you been doing
with yourself?

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:43.640
- Working at a hotel.
- Waiting tables?

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.280
Till the manager
found out I could dance.

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:49.040
Then he put me in a floor show.

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:50.160
Kind of him.

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:53.000
Yes. He was very kind.

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.840
He almost restored my faith
in human nature.

01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:57.240
Only almost?

01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:58.840
He did...

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.680
until I remembered you.

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.200
Touché.

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.920
What are you doing back here?

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:09.680
Just visiting.
I heard about your misfortune...

01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:12.280
thought I'd see
if you needed anything.

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:15.160
You know what I really need,
baby?

01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:18.040
I need you to stay out
of my life.

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.080
You haven't lost your charm,
Oscar. I should have known.

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:25.080
Well... good-bye.

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:39.280
Remember the carousel?

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:41.240
Sure, I remember the carousel.

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:44.440
I remember it
like a trip to the dentist.

01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:46.440
Easy! Easy!

01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:48.000
Stop!

01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:55.680
Asshole.
Did you think I'd forgotten?

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:13.200
She came to see me when
I got out of intensive care.

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:15.480
She said, "There's bad news
and there's good news.

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:19.000
"You're paralyzed from
the waist down, permanently."

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:20.760
"OK," I said.

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:22.280
"Let's have the good news."

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:25.640
"That was the good news,"
she said.

01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:28.280
"The bad news
is that from now on...

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:30.200
"I'm taking care of you."

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:38.160
We were a couple once more.

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:41.120
She moved back into my place
and looked after me...

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:43.840
with a strange kind of devotion
to duty.

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:47.800
She was my cook,
my housekeeper, my jailer...

01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:50.040
and my nurse.

01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.480
Oh, couldn't you...

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:01.520
I mean, it makes my leg shake...

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:05.080
if you always shoot me
in the same spot.

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:07.920
You see? It makes the leg shake.

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:10.200
Couldn't you find
some other place?

01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:13.560
- You want me to have another go?
- No, the next time.

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:16.000
Look what you made me do, silly.

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:25.720
My God, you're not
going to use it again?

01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:27.480
None left.

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:29.040
I'll get some more tomorrow.

01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:37.560
It crossed my mind
she might still love me...

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.840
in spite of everything.

01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:42.440
After all, it's no fun
hurting someone...

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:44.800
who means nothing to you.

01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:47.800
Hey, Tiger. Come and get it.

01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:57.400
Aren't you having any?

01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.720
I'm going out.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.080
Nothing in it?

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.320
Like what?

01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:07.560
I don't know.
Maybe tomatoes, mushrooms?

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.560
Would you like some mushrooms?

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.920
Well, yeah. That would be nice.

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:15.040
You want some, go pick some.

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:21.880
Yes, I do.

01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:25.400
Oh, no, he's not available.

01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:27.160
Who's calling, please?

01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:34.480
No. This is his nurse speaking.

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:36.880
What the...
Who says I'm not available?

01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.400
Ah, you heard.

01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.120
Yeah, very sad.

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:46.360
Who is it?

01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:50.200
No. Quite impossible,
I'm afraid.

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:52.360
He's completely incapacitated.

01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.680
I will.

01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:58.600
You're welcome. Good-bye.

01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.800
Who was it?

01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:03.840
"Paris is out. Vieux jeu."

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:06.320
Beverly, you mean?
What did she want?

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.360
What did she want,
for God's sake?

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:12.800
How would I know?

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:15.240
You might have let me
speak to her.

01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:20.120
I said, you might have
let me speak to her.

01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:21.800
I heard you.

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:27.040
Jesus, Mimi, I never get to see
or speak to a soul these days.

01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:29.200
It's like I'm in solitary.

01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:30.360
Is it?

01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:34.280
Look...

01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:38.000
I know I deserve all I get.

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:41.240
I treated you like a monster.

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:42.680
I am a monster.

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:46.240
Tiger! You don't have the right
to criticize yourself.

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.000
That's my privilege.

01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:50.280
- I know.
- I earned it.

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:53.360
But I promise,
I will never hurt you again.

01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:00.600
You... hurt me?

01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:01.880
Very funny.

01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:09.240
And don't play with your zizi
while I'm gone.

01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:10.840
There is no point.

01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:12.840
Thank God you're home.

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:15.160
You missed me?

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:17.560
As much as you missed me
after you dumped me?

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:19.160
Oh, no, not that again.

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:21.400
Please, let's not have a scene.

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:23.680
Why not? I love scenes.

01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:25.720
I've developed a taste for them.

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:28.720
In fact,
I can't do without them.

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.440
What is that?

01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:33.240
What do you think it is?

01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:36.720
What do you expect if you go out
and leave me alone all night?

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:40.120
I wet myself, of course.

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:41.920
Oh, poor Tiger.

01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:44.000
I'd better change your diaper.

01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:45.560
God, you stink.

01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.440
Why don't you
just finish me off?

01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:50.040
Why don't you O. D. Me...

01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:53.120
or push me down the stairs
or something?

01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:56.200
I almost forgot.

01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.520
It's your birthday, isn't it?

01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:07.080
Is it?

01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:08.360
I didn't remember.

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:47.560
Happy birthday to you

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:48.880
Happy birthday to you

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:50.200
Happy birthday, dear Oscar

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:51.360
Happy birthday to you

01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:14.400
Although she kept me
starved of human contact...

01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:16.640
she enjoyed taking me out...

01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:19.320
because she knew how much
it hurt to be reminded...

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:23.720
of the simple little pleasures
that were denied me forevermore.

01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:27.160
Antoine,
laisse le monsieur tranquille...

01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:29.120
tu vois qu'il a bobo.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.680
Funny. You might have
been good with kids.

01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:37.320
Who knows?

01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:39.520
You never will.
That's for sure.

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.440
It wasn't that I just didn't
want that child we made.

01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:47.000
I didn't think
I was worthy of it.

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:49.400
You could still have some.

01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:50.680
No fear of that.

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:53.160
I'm a safe fuck these days.

01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:54.480
What do you mean?

01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:59.000
That abortion
you so kindly paid for...

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:01.480
left me with an infection.

01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:03.360
I was quite ill in Martinique.

01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:06.520
Almost died,
as a matter of fact.

01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:08.480
You never told me.

01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:10.880
Well, I'm telling you now.

01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:14.640
Oh, Christ, what a shit I was.
I despise myself.

01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:16.080
I hate myself.

01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:19.000
I hate myself worse
than you could ever hate me.

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.720
Don't kid yourself, Oscar.

01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:23.600
No one could hate you
more than I do.

01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:30.640
Why do you stay with me?

01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:32.400
You really don't know?

01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:37.640
Because you're precious to me,
more precious than ever before.

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:38.960
Here.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.400
So there it was.

01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:43.400
We needed each other, she and I.

01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:47.280
It's getting awfully cold.

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:51.960
Mimi, the water's getting cold.

01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:56.440
Oh, merde.
It's run out again.

01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:58.680
I must speak to the concierge
about it.

01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:01.720
Don't go away.

01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:08.280
Ouais? Ouais et toi?

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:14.040
Non j'peux pas je suis
vraiment cassée.

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:18.200
Non je voudrais bien mais
je suis vraiment cassée.

01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:21.360
Quais m'en plus j'ai rien
à m'foutre sur le cul.

01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:23.640
V ous bouffez a quelle heure?

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:25.760
Ah, laisse tomber ouf.

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.440
C'est wrai?

01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:31.960
Ah, c'est cool de I'avoir
invite pour moi.

01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:41.520
Moi remarque j'sais pas
je me le ferai bien quandmeme.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.120
Ouais?

01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:54.440
Ah, ça doit etre beau.

01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:57.960
Ouais, tu me la passeras?

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:00.520
Ouais?

01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:05.400
Ouais.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:15.920
That was great. Thank you.

01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:18.800
You didn't know
I could cook, did you?

01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:20.480
Thought I could
only shake a leg, huh?

01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:22.920
- You shake a leg real good.
- Better than I cook?

01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:26.040
Sure... Well, I mean, um, no.

01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:28.960
You cook real good,
but you could dance even better.

01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:30.000
You don't work at it.

01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:31.160
What's the point?

01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:32.560
I could never dance
as good as you.

01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:33.680
Sure, you could.

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:35.800
Come on. You're special.

01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:37.560
Isn't he special, Tiger?

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:40.120
Absolutely.

01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:42.840
You see?
He loves to watch you dance.

01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:44.280
He thinks you're gorgeous.

01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:46.000
Right, Tiger?

01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:47.120
Right.

01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:49.240
How about that?
Look at that.

01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:51.960
Get a load of that.
Come on.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.880
Hey, Mims, you're crazy.

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:55.000
Come on.

01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:58.680
Isn't that something?

01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:01.800
And he's not gay, either.
That's very rare.

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:04.120
Show him your extension.

01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:05.280
Come on.

01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:12.800
How about that, Tiger?

01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:14.720
You should try it sometime.

01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:18.640
Come on, Basil.
Dance a little for Oscar.

01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:21.240
- I don't know. I ate too much.
- Come on.

01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:25.040
The poor baby gets so little fun
out of life these days.

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:27.720
No entertainment at all.

01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:30.800
Well?

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:42.800
Come on! Don't stop!

01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:57.520
Dance! Dance!

01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:47.440
I'd grown accustomed
to being only half a man...

01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:52.240
but that night,
I really hit rock bottom.

01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:55.440
It was a kind of catharsis,
I guess.

01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.760
We both knew
we'd never rediscover...

01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:01.080
the same extremes
of passion and cruelty...

01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:02.520
with another living soul.

01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:04.000
Monsieur Oscar Benton...

01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:06.200
consentez-vous
a prendre pour espouse...

01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:08.360
Mademoiselle Micheline Bouvier?

01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:10.680
Mademoiselle
Micheline Bouvier...

01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:12.640
consentez-vous a prendre
pour epoux...

01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:14.040
Monsieur Oscar Benton?

01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:17.120
Conformement a la loi
je vous declare unis...

01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:18.680
par les liens du mariage.

01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:22.680
We were like the survivors
of a catastrophe so terrible...

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:24.840
it formed a bond between us...

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:27.880
shared by no one else
in the world.

01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:50.240
So the relationship
had come full circle.

01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:52.200
We'd reached a plateau.

01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:57.800
The dust has settled since then,
but I live in constant dread.

01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:00.600
I'm forever afraid of losing
what's left of her heart...

01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:02.200
to some lucky bastard.

01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:08.160
It feels strange
to be confessing this...

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:10.640
to someone who's hoping
he'll be the one.

01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:12.120
Now don't deny it.

01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:15.080
There's only room in this cabin
for one hypocrite.

01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:21.160
If you're not going to stay
and have another drink...

01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:23.160
you might as well go.

01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:24.800
There's no more to tell.

01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:40.280
I think I understand you
better now.

01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:41.400
And her?

01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:46.160
Yeah, and her.

01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:56.920
Shit, shit, shit.

01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:05.560
Look...

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:08.760
Let's be adult about this,
shall we?

01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:13.760
Yeah, adult. That's the word.

01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:16.680
Anything I can do,
you can do better. Feel free.

01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:19.800
I won't object
if you have a little fling...

01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:22.080
with that Italian, for example.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.600
Taking the plunge at last?

01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:51.520
I think I need a drink.

01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:56.600
I said, I think I need a drink.
Can I get you one?

01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:06.880
Can I have a whiskey, please?
No ice.

01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:10.480
That was some stunt.

01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:14.040
Pretty good for a guy
with two left feet.

01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:16.000
Well, I don't pretend
to be a dancer.

01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:19.400
Just kidding, Nigel.
I'm not so hot myself.

01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:24.560
Will you look at that
Latin lover boy go?

01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:31.520
Watch out. He'll snap her up.

01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:41.560
Almost time.

01:58:41.560 --> 01:58:43.360
Where is that
English rose of yours?

01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:45.240
She'll miss all the fun
if she doesn't hurry up.

01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:48.680
Fiona's not much of a sailor.
She's flat out on her bunk.

01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:51.000
That is a disappointment.

01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:53.400
Yeah, yeah.
Dosed herself on Dramamine.

01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:56.000
Pity. Mimi and I were hoping...

01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:58.360
to crack a bottle of champagne
with you later on...

01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:00.200
the two of you.

01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:02.320
A little farewell get-together
with our special friends.

01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:04.480
All right, folks,
this is it.

01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:05.960
You got something
you want to do this year...

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.240
you'd better hurry up.

01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:09.640
We've got only about
ten seconds left.

01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:12.680
Nine... eight...

01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:14.880
seven... six...

01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:16.960
five... four...

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.040
three... two...

01:59:19.080 --> 01:59:20.440
one!

01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:37.400
Well, baby?

01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:44.960
Happy days, Oscar.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:46.120
Sure.

01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:48.640
Happy days.

01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:01.080
Your good health.

02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:03.960
You notice that I do not say,
"Happy New Year."

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.040
To those whose gaze
is focused on eternity...

02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:09.040
one year
is the same as the next.

02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:10.520
You don't say.

02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:12.240
In that case, cheers.

02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:16.200
Deliver a bottle of champagne
to room A-29.

02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:17.480
On my tab.

02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:19.040
Oscar Benton. OK?

02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:35.600
All right,
boys and girls, that'll do.

02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:36.800
Come on, stop that.

02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:39.760
Is this any way to start
a new year?

02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:41.640
Peace! Let's have some peace!

02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:45.200
Shalom! Shalom!

02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:49.360
All right, all right.
Settle down, boys and girls.

02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:46.080
Why?

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:48.720
I thought...

02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:50.160
You thought what?

02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:53.720
But you said...

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:55.880
I mean, I know how
your story ends now.

02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:57.400
No, you don't.

02:01:57.440 --> 02:01:59.640
Not yet.

02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:00.920
I think...

02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:05.000
I think I've fallen
in love with you.

02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:10.200
Come on. I'm just a fantasy,
an amusement on a boring voyage.

02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:14.000
You mean it's still just a game?

02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:16.240
Did I ever say it wasn't?

02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:19.640
But...

02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:22.360
I'm truly, sincerely
in love with you.

02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:24.760
That's why you will
never have me.

02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:31.600
You're hurting me terribly.

02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:34.080
The way you're
hurting your wife?

02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:36.560
She doesn't know about us.
She knows nothing.

02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:38.840
She's looking right at us.

02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:48.080
Having a good time?

02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:50.280
Darling, this is wonderful.

02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:52.680
- Yes, isn't it?
- How are you feeling?

02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:55.080
Good as new,
thanks to your ministrations.

02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:56.200
There.

02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:59.360
Now you can make
your New Year's resolutions.

02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:02.280
Do you think it's safe
to drink on an empty stomach?

02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:04.480
Who wants to be safe?

02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:08.400
I'm feeling dangerous tonight.

02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:10.640
That's the spirit, Fiona.

02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:12.240
I knew that your presence...

02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:15.120
would add a little spice
to tonight's proceedings.

02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:17.360
That was a very kind thought
of yours.

02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:18.640
I've never seen my husband...

02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:21.360
in action
with another woman before.

02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:24.240
Oscar had me woken
with a bottle of champagne.

02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:25.680
You call that action?

02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:28.560
I don't think he was
getting anywhere with her.

02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:32.600
It's a shame.

02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:10.720
Maybe I made a mistake
about you, Nigel.

02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:13.560
Maybe your wife
would've been a better bet.

02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:25.640
Come on, stop sulking, man.

02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:29.520
You ought to be glad
they're getting it on so well.

02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:32.880
Come on. Put a funny hat on.
It'll make you feel better.

02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:35.040
Throw some streamers at them.

02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:42.960
Attaboy!

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.360
It's the "Titanic"
all over again!

02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:49.120
Nearer my God to thee

02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:51.960
Nearer to thee

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.120
I know how you feel, Nigel.

02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:24.240
I've been a loser all my life.

02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:25.680
Join the club.

02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:27.440
Don't touch me!

02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:29.840
If you weren't a cripple,
I'd knock your fucking head off.

02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:31.760
Go ahead if it'll help.

02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:33.080
I deserve your hatred.

02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:35.320
I'm abominable. I'm pathetic.

02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:42.120
No, not that way, Nigel.

02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:43.560
Nigel, you better hurry.

02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:46.240
There'll be nothing left
for you.

02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:54.080
Bloody hell!

02:07:58.360 --> 02:07:59.640
Is she here?

02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:20.120
Did you ever see such
an allegory of grace and beauty?

02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:24.040
Two nymphs sleeping off
their amatory exertions.

02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:28.400
You really missed something,
Nigel.

02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:32.240
Fiona was a revelation.

02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:34.560
All fire.

02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:41.080
I doubt if you've ever really
made the most of her.

02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:44.400
Swine!

02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:47.640
Get your goddamn hands off me.

02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:56.880
You prick.

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:03.760
You don't deserve to hear
the rest of my story.

02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:05.880
My.

02:09:05.920 --> 02:09:07.280
Here, give it.

02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:09.440
Just give me that thing,
all right?

02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:10.920
Otherwise you're going
to hurt somebody.

02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:12.240
Come on, man,
Don't be a bloody fool.

02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:13.800
- Give it to me.
- Hurt somebody?

02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:19.240
Not anymore.

02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:28.760
We were just too greedy, baby.

02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:32.320
That was all.

02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:11.840
Hello, sweetheart.

02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:15.000
My father says to wish you
a Happy New Year.
