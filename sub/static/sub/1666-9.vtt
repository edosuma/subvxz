00:00.006 --> 00:03.153
Klaus, voice-over: My siblings and
I are the first vampires in history,

00:03.175 --> 00:04.468
The Originals.

00:04.563 --> 00:07.907
300 years ago, we helped build New Orleans.

00:07.922 --> 00:10.613
In our absence, a new king arose.

00:10.733 --> 00:13.929
Now I've returned and
taken his kingdom as my own.

00:13.968 --> 00:16.259
I had hoped this would
bring our family together.

00:16.290 --> 00:17.424
I was wrong.

00:17.426 --> 00:19.175
I wanted our home back,

00:19.177 --> 00:20.893
so I'm going to live there,

00:20.913 --> 00:22.295
and the two of you,

00:22.297 --> 00:25.065
you can stay here together and rot.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.700
You're coming with me, little wolf.

00:26.820 --> 00:28.400
Why would I go anywhere with you?

00:28.420 --> 00:29.734
Now you can fight me on this,

00:29.750 --> 00:30.947
but you will lose,

00:30.970 --> 00:32.674
as will anyone else who tries to stop you

00:32.714 --> 00:34.324
getting in this car.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.813
[Clanging]

00:43.509 --> 00:46.236
Let us begin with a toast

00:46.356 --> 00:48.396
to our shared gift...

00:48.759 --> 00:50.010
immortality.

00:50.492 --> 00:52.087
After 1,000 years,

00:52.125 --> 00:54.934
one might expect for life
to be less keenly felt,

00:55.130 --> 00:59.088
for its beauties and its
sorrows to diminish with time,

00:59.208 --> 01:00.808
but as vampires,

01:00.928 --> 01:05.325
we feel more deeply than
humans could possibly imagine...

01:09.406 --> 01:11.783
insatiable need,

01:12.948 --> 01:15.398
exquisite pain...

01:28.539 --> 01:30.911
Our victories,

01:32.055 --> 01:33.883
and our defeats.

01:35.959 --> 01:38.024
You can't afford your wounded pride.

01:38.144 --> 01:39.813
With Klaus in control of your empire,

01:39.832 --> 01:41.621
you need to give him what he craves most...

01:41.634 --> 01:42.848
loyalty,

01:42.968 --> 01:44.731
or at least the illusion of it.

01:44.775 --> 01:46.145
I ambushed him,

01:46.489 --> 01:48.160
tried to bury him alive.

01:48.541 --> 01:49.912
He's not gonna trust me.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.464
He will because he wants your allegiance.

01:52.887 --> 01:54.688
Speaking from experience, I know that

01:54.690 --> 01:56.419
if you play the part, all is forgiven,

01:56.438 --> 01:58.284
but if you give him
any reason to doubt you,

01:58.297 --> 02:00.249
he will strike back.

02:04.832 --> 02:07.046
Make me a promise, Marcel.

02:07.559 --> 02:09.618
You do whatever it takes to stay alive.

02:13.506 --> 02:16.322
To my city, my home again.

02:16.442 --> 02:19.331
May the blood never cease to flow.

02:19.748 --> 02:21.621
And the party never end.

02:24.101 --> 02:25.674
Diego: I just don't get it, man.

02:25.794 --> 02:27.721
You know we would've stood
with you till the end.

02:27.841 --> 02:30.230
Letting you do that would've
been letting you die,

02:30.232 --> 02:31.707
and you're still my people.

02:32.163 --> 02:33.828
For now, just follow my lead.

02:34.134 --> 02:35.767
Trust me, it ain't over yet.

02:36.355 --> 02:37.569
To New Orleans.

02:37.620 --> 02:39.659
- To New Orleans.
- New Orleans.

02:42.476 --> 02:44.846
I understand that some
of you may have questions

02:44.864 --> 02:47.305
regarding the recent change in leadership,

02:47.542 --> 02:49.520
and I invited you here
tonight to assure you

02:49.526 --> 02:52.254
that you are not defeated.

02:52.279 --> 02:54.393
No. My intentions

02:54.456 --> 02:57.522
moving forward are to
celebrate what we have,

02:57.872 --> 03:01.952
what Marcel, in fact, took...

03:04.586 --> 03:07.533
and built into this...

03:07.653 --> 03:12.457
a true community of vampires.

03:13.245 --> 03:16.276
What about her, the wolf?

03:18.362 --> 03:21.453
Had you let me finish, Diego,

03:22.242 --> 03:23.843
you would know that there is, of course,

03:23.862 --> 03:26.884
one further matter I would like to address.

03:27.678 --> 03:29.512
As many of you know,

03:30.012 --> 03:32.221
the girl is carrying my child.

03:32.252 --> 03:35.055
Consequently, I trust you will all

03:35.111 --> 03:37.294
pay her the appropriate respect.

03:37.414 --> 03:38.176
However,

03:38.182 --> 03:41.485
I understand that some of
you are concerned by this

03:41.811 --> 03:43.244
vicious rumor

03:43.769 --> 03:47.679
that I intend to use the blood of our child

03:47.799 --> 03:49.693
to create hybrids.

03:50.907 --> 03:53.147
I assure you, I do not.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.968
Father of the year.

03:57.702 --> 04:00.160
It appears I will have to earn your trust.

04:00.404 --> 04:01.824
Very well.

04:02.037 --> 04:04.627
We'll eliminate the root of your anxiety.

04:04.747 --> 04:07.987
You see, how can I sire any hybrids

04:08.344 --> 04:12.461
if there are no more werewolves
alive in the bayou to turn?

04:12.581 --> 04:13.555
What?

04:14.194 --> 04:17.741
- Klaus, no.
- So eat, drink, and be merry,

04:17.785 --> 04:19.536
and tomorrow I suggest you have yourselves

04:19.562 --> 04:21.207
a little wolf hunt.

04:21.801 --> 04:24.610
Go ahead. Have fun.

04:25.818 --> 04:27.307
Kill them all.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.931
Rebekah: Absolutely not. I paid for that.

04:38.051 --> 04:40.541
Please. Never paid for
anything in your life.

04:40.585 --> 04:42.663
I hardly see how that's relevant.

04:43.765 --> 04:45.521
Nik is just punishing us.

04:45.759 --> 04:47.723
Well, we've hurt him,

04:47.729 --> 04:49.068
deeply, it would appear.

04:49.103 --> 04:51.296
We believed the worst
about him the one time

04:51.321 --> 04:53.898
in a million when the worst
wasn't actually the truth.

04:54.709 --> 04:55.942
Where do you think you're going?

04:56.845 --> 04:57.896
To ensure that Hayley doesn't

04:57.940 --> 04:59.523
suffer for our mistakes.

05:00.674 --> 05:02.658
Niklaus is feeling vindictive.

05:02.846 --> 05:05.335
We cannot trust that she is safe.

05:11.547 --> 05:13.830
Klaus: And so then I bit Elijah

05:13.868 --> 05:15.219
and left him in the bayou

05:15.244 --> 05:17.628
with my hybrid venom in his veins.

05:17.866 --> 05:20.087
Serves him right for making such

05:20.207 --> 05:22.409
vile accusations against me,

05:22.440 --> 05:24.042
and let...

05:25.168 --> 05:26.634
are you taking this down?

05:26.644 --> 05:27.914
To be clear,

05:28.365 --> 05:29.779
if the quarter is yours now,

05:29.805 --> 05:31.381
you still need me why?

05:31.393 --> 05:32.687
My memoirs.

05:32.807 --> 05:35.267
1,000 years of history
isn't gonna write itself.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.529
Cami, what are you doing here?

05:40.566 --> 05:42.031
My question exactly.

05:42.033 --> 05:44.016
Oh, it's quite all right. She knows.

05:44.351 --> 05:45.390
She does?

05:45.409 --> 05:46.654
That you're vampires?

05:47.217 --> 05:48.838
Don't worry. He's compelled
me to forget everything

05:48.838 --> 05:50.214
as soon as I leave.

05:50.971 --> 05:52.841
That way, I'm too busy agonizing over

05:52.860 --> 05:54.719
whether or not I'm losing my damn mind

05:54.746 --> 05:56.579
to realize I'm playing spy

05:56.581 --> 05:58.381
for an immortal egomaniac.

05:58.383 --> 06:00.555
You compelled her to go
out with me, didn't you?

06:01.750 --> 06:03.433
And I thought you really liked me.

06:03.471 --> 06:04.403
So did I.

06:04.434 --> 06:05.742
Klaus: Well, I mean, to be clear,

06:05.792 --> 06:07.512
I only compelled you to give him a chance.

06:07.525 --> 06:09.902
Anything you felt for him was quite real...

06:12.587 --> 06:14.851
and, for the record, the

06:14.971 --> 06:17.736
level of awkwardness we're
all currently experiencing

06:17.761 --> 06:19.281
is entirely genuine.

06:19.938 --> 06:21.610
You think you're so clever, don't you,

06:21.730 --> 06:24.000
compelling the poor, naive bartender?

06:24.120 --> 06:25.570
Look what I found,

06:25.690 --> 06:28.244
real me, not your compelled therapist.

06:30.030 --> 06:33.353
Well, actually I prefer
devoted stenographer.

06:33.597 --> 06:35.067
You think this is funny,

06:35.592 --> 06:36.719
messing with my mind?

06:36.725 --> 06:38.771
My sanity is not a joke.

06:38.971 --> 06:41.593
No, luv, I don't believe it is.

06:44.140 --> 06:45.860
You never found this.

06:46.198 --> 06:47.574
You will remember nothing of our life

06:47.593 --> 06:49.001
as vampires when you leave here.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.309
Do you understand?

06:53.813 --> 06:56.405
I think that just about
does it for the day.

06:57.260 --> 06:58.758
You may go.

07:15.085 --> 07:16.950
Going somewhere?

07:21.320 --> 07:22.628
Elijah.

07:22.748 --> 07:25.431
You shouldn't be here. Klaus
has his guys watching me.

07:25.551 --> 07:27.283
I wouldn't worry about them.

07:27.339 --> 07:29.122
Agh!

07:30.305 --> 07:32.023
Come. We mustn't linger.

07:32.051 --> 07:32.864
Let's get you someplace safe.

07:32.914 --> 07:35.335
No. You don't have to
worry about me. I'm fine.

07:35.385 --> 07:37.130
I've been deemed under protection

07:37.181 --> 07:38.932
by the almighty Klaus.

07:39.133 --> 07:41.223
It's the werewolves who need help.

07:41.448 --> 07:43.063
He ordered a wolf hunt

07:43.088 --> 07:45.036
as some jacked-up peace offering

07:45.046 --> 07:46.547
to Marcel's crew.

07:46.842 --> 07:47.843
You have to help them.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.175
Out in the bayou?

07:49.295 --> 07:52.466
Do we look like a bloody
vampire rescue squad?

07:52.948 --> 07:54.975
I think you should be
grateful we came to save you.

07:55.095 --> 07:56.571
Listen,

07:56.946 --> 07:58.198
Rebekah. All my life,

07:58.223 --> 08:00.694
I've wanted to know who
my real family was, and

08:00.814 --> 08:03.722
just as I find out that
they're out there in the bayou,

08:03.741 --> 08:05.324
Klaus orders them killed.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.854
You want to help me?

08:12.179 --> 08:13.731
Help my people,

08:14.907 --> 08:16.315
please.

08:18.989 --> 08:20.750
Humans have called a meeting.

08:20.819 --> 08:21.939
They're not exactly thrilled

08:21.958 --> 08:23.097
with the new status quo.

08:23.217 --> 08:24.974
How unfortunate for them.

08:25.094 --> 08:26.438
Look. It's your show now,

08:26.475 --> 08:28.158
but you want to know
how I built what I built?

08:28.183 --> 08:29.246
Politics.

08:29.278 --> 08:30.835
A little diplomacy goes a long way,

08:30.848 --> 08:33.113
especially with the human faction.

08:34.551 --> 08:36.472
Duly noted.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.549
I haven't thought about
this night in ages...

08:41.669 --> 08:45.238
1919, the Opera House
just before it burned.

08:45.662 --> 08:48.541
This was the end of an era.

08:49.285 --> 08:51.556
Now, in the interest of new beginnings,

08:51.556 --> 08:53.114
I feel there are some things

08:53.133 --> 08:55.279
I should probably confess to you,

08:56.292 --> 08:59.285
but where to begin?

08:59.405 --> 09:01.454
Thierry was never disloyal to you.

09:01.574 --> 09:03.824
I set him up in an attempt
to locate my brother.

09:03.855 --> 09:04.919
He's your friend,

09:04.950 --> 09:07.428
and, consequently, he
can return to the compound

09:07.548 --> 09:08.978
at your discretion.

09:08.980 --> 09:10.481
Cami's part

09:10.513 --> 09:11.802
you just learned,

09:11.922 --> 09:13.491
and then there's young Joshua.

09:13.816 --> 09:15.424
I've been compelling
him from the beginning,

09:15.442 --> 09:17.144
although I suspect you already knew that,

09:17.169 --> 09:19.371
as he was the one who
led me into your trap.

09:20.478 --> 09:22.737
I may have fed the kid some misinformation.

09:22.857 --> 09:23.663
Mm,

09:24.476 --> 09:26.078
and then there's Davina.

09:26.198 --> 09:27.823
She's a powerful weapon.

09:27.855 --> 09:30.133
At this point, I'd like
to keep her close at hand.

09:30.253 --> 09:31.717
I think we should have her move

09:31.771 --> 09:33.719
into the compound here with us.

09:33.936 --> 09:35.354
Eh, she can't leave the attic.

09:35.388 --> 09:36.922
I already tried to move her once.

09:37.127 --> 09:38.560
Yes. About that,

09:38.879 --> 09:41.726
turns out, your little
witch is quite the actress.

09:41.788 --> 09:44.228
She made a deal with Elijah
while he was in captivity,

09:44.260 --> 09:45.744
tricked you into letting her stay put

09:45.767 --> 09:48.621
in exchange for some spells
from our mother's grimoire.

09:50.416 --> 09:51.474
Good to know.

09:52.168 --> 09:53.313
Is that all?

09:53.507 --> 09:55.159
I do believe it is.

09:56.085 --> 09:57.543
Appreciate the honesty.

09:57.779 --> 09:59.068
Ah.

10:00.827 --> 10:02.697
Meeting is in an hour.

10:35.399 --> 10:36.370
[Beep]

10:36.407 --> 10:38.015
Klaus on recorder: ...
And so then I bit Elijah

10:38.040 --> 10:41.294
and left him in the bayou with
my hybrid venom in his veins.

10:41.525 --> 10:45.279
Serves him right for making
such vile accusations against me.

10:49.569 --> 10:51.615
You're gonna love it at the compound.

10:51.671 --> 10:53.598
I already got the best room
in the place picked out.

10:53.637 --> 10:55.103
I can't leave.

10:55.105 --> 10:56.740
Remember what happened last time?

10:59.905 --> 11:01.951
I know about your deal with Elijah.

11:03.159 --> 11:04.646
We can't be lying to each other.

11:05.311 --> 11:06.714
I'm trying to protect you.

11:06.716 --> 11:08.752
With the witches still looking
to kill you for the Harvest,

11:08.759 --> 11:10.404
believe me, you're safest with us.

11:10.454 --> 11:13.332
Klaus: Plus, there's excellent
light in the afternoon.

11:15.172 --> 11:17.018
I see you're an artist.

11:18.381 --> 11:19.802
Wonderful.

11:20.596 --> 11:24.369
I look forward to
witnessing your many talents.

11:25.439 --> 11:26.696
Was this his idea?

11:26.726 --> 11:28.298
Davina, please.

11:28.529 --> 11:31.345
I understand you're devoted to Marcel,

11:31.357 --> 11:33.491

11:34.673 --> 11:37.294
I assume you want what's
best for all of us.

11:42.832 --> 11:45.498
We have a meeting to attend downstairs.

11:56.044 --> 11:57.939
Look. I'll get someone
to pick up your things.

11:57.941 --> 11:59.898
We'll get you settled in right.

Trust me.

12:10.781 --> 12:13.315
Klaus, Marcel, thank you for coming.

12:13.634 --> 12:15.924
Now, we are aware of
the change in leadership

12:15.961 --> 12:17.463
in your community,

12:17.583 --> 12:18.314
and we thought it was time

12:18.326 --> 12:20.134
to make the appropriate introductions.

12:21.755 --> 12:23.306
We want to be sure you understand

12:23.306 --> 12:24.682
how things work around here.

12:25.083 --> 12:26.484
Is that so?

12:27.917 --> 12:29.506
What the Mayor means

12:29.531 --> 12:31.039
is that we just want some assurance

12:31.039 --> 12:32.065
that this new development

12:32.090 --> 12:34.111
isn't gonna endanger our
city or its inhabitants.

12:37.189 --> 12:39.397
and we'll look the other way.

12:40.268 --> 12:42.101
As long as our pockets stay full,

12:42.495 --> 12:44.116
we won't have a problem.

12:45.586 --> 12:47.682
More importantly,

12:48.145 --> 12:49.823
there are rules.

attention to the city.

Now, history has proven that
we can coexist peacefully.

- You answer to us.

Ha ha! Ok. I'm sorry.
Let me get this straight.

I'm to play supplicant to this pompous ass

13:07.641 --> 13:10.350

13:11.896 --> 13:15.556
Ah, here are my terms.

13:16.051 --> 13:20.249
You will take whatever
scraps I see fit to leave you,

13:20.273 --> 13:22.158

13:22.278 --> 13:23.848
If that doesn't suit you,

outlived your usefulness.

What the hell are you doing out here?

13:48.344 --> 13:49.489
I've come to suggest you seek

other hunting grounds.

Suggestion noted.

13:53.339 --> 13:55.414

13:55.439 --> 13:57.479

23:53.503 --> 23:54.810
to subdue my baby brother Niklaus,

23:54.840 --> 23:59.572
this despite a better that 100:1 advantage,

24:01.587 --> 24:03.764
I recommend you heed my warning.

24:12.916 --> 24:14.058
Impressive.

24:14.473 --> 24:17.470
Well, I thought the situation
demanded something a little dramatic.

24:24.209 --> 24:25.823
Who are you people?

24:31.681 --> 24:33.652
I would say the better question,

24:56.635 --> 24:57.677

24:57.695 --> 24:58.911
You play the part well enough.

24:58.915 --> 25:00.953
I should know, having played it myself,

25:00.998 --> 25:02.444
but there was a time when the affinity

25:02.462 --> 25:04.140
between us was quite real.

25:04.443 --> 25:05.635
Oh, sure,

25:05.910 --> 25:08.513
and then you got it in your
head to take what I created.

25:08.731 --> 25:10.096
When I picked up that coin,

25:10.116 --> 25:12.267
I swore loyalty, Klaus, not friendship.

25:13.452 --> 25:14.582
All right. I'm holding up my end.

The other one has to be earned.

25:17.685 --> 25:18.906
Fair enough.

Then you should probably
know the whole story.

At first, the promise of an offspring

25:38.694 --> 25:40.184
meant little to me,

25:42.005 --> 25:43.875
but then I recalled my father,

25:44.316 --> 25:45.890

I admit...

26:24.072 --> 26:25.900

35:52.096 --> 35:54.254
If you knew even a fraction of who I am,

35:54.273 --> 35:55.956
it would break you in two.

35:56.650 --> 35:58.271
Then show me.

36:05.182 --> 36:06.717
D'aagh!

36:07.562 --> 36:09.014
Niklaus!

36:09.432 --> 36:11.891
It hurts. Aah! Aah!

36:12.173 --> 36:13.524
Aaagh!

36:14.225 --> 36:15.345
He's a beast.

36:16.020 --> 36:17.285
Elijah, hold him down.

36:17.310 --> 36:18.893
Brother, please,

36:18.918 --> 36:20.419
don't let them do this to me.

36:20.539 --> 36:23.028
Do it now, boy. Now!

36:26.253 --> 36:27.471
Help me.

36:27.658 --> 36:29.772
[Gasps]

36:29.967 --> 36:31.312
Oh...

36:31.950 --> 36:33.276
[Panting]

36:33.696 --> 36:35.512
Oh, my God.

36:38.169 --> 36:41.167
No one should have to
experience things like that.

36:46.912 --> 36:48.877
Knowing what you do about this world

36:48.920 --> 36:51.129
will only get you killed,

36:53.094 --> 36:55.721
and I cannot allow that.

37:02.199 --> 37:04.871
Leave New Orleans.

37:05.371 --> 37:07.580
Forget everything

37:07.805 --> 37:10.051
you've learned here today.

37:11.402 --> 37:12.810
Forget me.

37:15.420 --> 37:17.716
You have no reason to stay.

37:18.054 --> 37:20.150
I have no reason to stay.

37:22.010 --> 37:25.161
[Music playing]

37:28.966 --> 37:30.723
Look. Things are good with
your brother right now.

37:30.843 --> 37:33.107
He wants to run things with me as partners,

37:33.151 --> 37:34.265
but if we keep meeting like this

37:34.296 --> 37:36.073
behind his back...

37:36.858 --> 37:38.538
you said it yourself,

37:38.944 --> 37:40.552
whatever it takes to stay alive.

37:40.862 --> 37:43.179
Oh, this is about survival, is it?

37:44.348 --> 37:46.520
If you were this pathetic
a liar with my brother,

37:46.552 --> 37:47.866
I'm surprised he hasn't killed you already.

37:47.884 --> 37:48.585
Come on, Rebekah.

37:48.598 --> 37:51.350
The only reward anyone ever
gets from loving Niklaus

37:51.356 --> 37:53.202
is suffering and death.

37:56.292 --> 37:59.221
You're choosing him over me, aren't you...

38:00.504 --> 38:01.767
Again.

38:02.037 --> 38:04.720
Rebekah, I got people to look out for...

38:08.205 --> 38:10.996
And Klaus is offering
me a choice to do that.

38:11.116 --> 38:13.298
With Davina working her
magic against the witches

38:13.317 --> 38:16.007
and an Original by my side,

38:16.714 --> 38:19.517
that's not something I
can just turn my back on,

38:20.118 --> 38:21.935
not even for you.

38:25.185 --> 38:27.687
When you were reliving
history with my brother,

38:27.692 --> 38:30.909
did you happen to revisit
what came next in 1919,

38:31.029 --> 38:33.656
or have you forgotten our little secret?

38:33.776 --> 38:36.720
I know the words that will
make him hate you forever.

38:38.353 --> 38:42.037
Remember that when you're
embracing your new family.

38:44.959 --> 38:47.377
[Music continues]

38:54.718 --> 38:57.203
[Whoosh]

39:00.107 --> 39:02.775
- Are they...
- They're safe...

39:04.378 --> 39:05.883
All of them.

39:16.657 --> 39:18.002
Thank you.

39:19.776 --> 39:22.606
What you did, Elijah, it means a lot.

39:25.015 --> 39:27.166
- You should keep this covered.
- I will.

39:28.237 --> 39:31.042
- If any of the others saw this...
- I promise.

39:38.628 --> 39:39.979
I should go.

39:40.099 --> 39:41.306
Right.

39:56.269 --> 39:57.663
Haven't you had your fill

39:57.665 --> 39:58.590
of telling me all the ways

39:58.590 --> 40:00.748
I've disappointed you, Elijah?

40:01.149 --> 40:02.388
Well, there is something important

40:02.419 --> 40:04.233
we neglected to discuss.

40:10.374 --> 40:13.365
I accused you of having ulterior motives

40:13.485 --> 40:15.398
regarding the child.

40:18.185 --> 40:19.677
I was wrong.

40:23.857 --> 40:25.759
I'm sorry.

40:29.349 --> 40:32.365
I imagine that must have
been hard for you to say.

40:35.903 --> 40:38.651
You don't make it easy
to love you, brother.

40:38.682 --> 40:41.627
And yet you're obstinate
in your desire to do so.

40:48.836 --> 40:50.713
When you're ready,

40:52.064 --> 40:54.160
should you be so inclined,

40:55.311 --> 40:57.432
both you and Rebekah

40:57.613 --> 41:00.122
are welcome to join me here.

41:06.079 --> 41:09.020
It is, after all, our family home.

41:19.947 --> 41:22.698
[Knocks on door]

41:27.121 --> 41:29.197
Cami, I need your help.

41:29.241 --> 41:32.090
Marcel has been lying to me,
and I can't trust him anymore.

41:32.112 --> 41:34.609
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

41:34.890 --> 41:37.405
Oh, you've been compelled.

41:37.525 --> 41:39.206
Ok. What are you doing?

41:39.244 --> 41:41.434
It's ok. I can fix you.

41:42.437 --> 41:44.199
I'm really sorry,

41:44.456 --> 41:46.151
but this is gonna hurt.

41:52.062 --> 41:55.042
Unh! Aah! Unh...

41:56.284 --> 41:58.934
Yaagh!
