WEBVTT

00:11.480 --> 00:13.141
So how'd you get out of gym class?

00:13.315 --> 00:17.376
Spared the sweats for a couple of days,
the perk of chairing the blood drive.

00:17.553 --> 00:20.613
I'm sorry. Aren't you the girl
who skinned her knee in 7th grade...

00:20.789 --> 00:25.283
- ... and passed out when she saw the blood?
- I was hoping I'd live that down, but yeah.

00:25.461 --> 00:28.487
Clark, you're gonna be late.
We gotta hit the showers.

00:31.734 --> 00:33.861
- Bye, Lana.
- Bye.

00:40.276 --> 00:42.608
- Troy, give it back!
- Amy, just hang on.

00:42.778 --> 00:45.269
Just want to see if you wrote
anything about me.

00:45.581 --> 00:50.211
Jeff, you know your sister's writing
psycho love letters to Lex Luthor?

00:50.686 --> 00:53.780
- It's always the quiet ones.
- Give it back to her.

00:53.989 --> 00:56.321
It's not my fault
you've got a weirdo for a sister.

00:56.492 --> 00:57.959
You're a child, Troy.

00:58.127 --> 01:01.927
It's because of boys like you
that girls want a man like Lex Luthor.

01:02.631 --> 01:05.759
Keep dreaming, Amy.
Your parents clean his bathrooms.

01:05.935 --> 01:08.631
You may live there,
but Luthor won't slum it with the help.

01:08.804 --> 01:10.465
Just leave her alone.

01:11.507 --> 01:13.168
What are you gonna do about it?

01:21.350 --> 01:22.840
Losers.

01:24.486 --> 01:27.046
So when are you donating blood?

01:27.790 --> 01:28.779
I don't know.

01:28.958 --> 01:33.588
Come on, Clark. Selflessly giving of yourself
to save others, girls love that.

01:38.067 --> 01:39.466
You okay?

01:40.169 --> 01:41.796
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074

02:02.992 --> 02:04.926
Very funny, guys.

02:22.578 --> 02:23.943
Stop it!

02:25.014 --> 02:26.538
Troy, you okay?

02:31.620 --> 02:32.609
What happened?

02:33.088 --> 02:34.749
It attacked me.

02:36.025 --> 02:38.152
It was like a ghost.

03:42.391 --> 03:44.086
So you didn't see anything?

03:44.259 --> 03:46.659
When I got there,
Troy was already on the floor.

03:46.829 --> 03:48.888
What about the voice he heard?

03:49.064 --> 03:51.362
Are you thinking
the locker room's haunted?

03:51.533 --> 03:54.866
Not unless the meteor rocks conjure up
ghosts of departed jockstraps...

03:55.037 --> 03:57.164
...which I seriously doubt.

03:57.339 --> 04:00.934
Thank you. Well, it's nice
to see you still have your standards.

04:01.110 --> 04:03.305
I don't have time right now.

04:03.612 --> 04:06.945
If you don't want to help me
with this blood drive, then just say so.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.277
- That's not it.
- That doesn't look pretty.

04:09.451 --> 04:10.713
Then what is it?

04:10.886 --> 04:13.013
I really don't wanna talk
about this now, okay?

04:13.188 --> 04:15.952
No, it's not okay.
You have been avoiding me for a week.

04:16.125 --> 04:19.219
Every time I ask you what's wrong,
you push me away.

04:21.063 --> 04:22.690
I'm worried about you.

04:23.232 --> 04:24.893
Don't be.

04:25.434 --> 04:27.026
I just need some space.

04:28.637 --> 04:31.834
If that's what you want, fine.
But if you can't even confide in me...

04:32.007 --> 04:34.942
...I don't know why we're going out
in the first place.

04:37.446 --> 04:39.676
Quick, pretend we weren't watching.

04:43.152 --> 04:44.483
Hey, Lana, how's it going?

04:44.653 --> 04:47.816
Not great, but thanks
for the courtesy clueless.

04:47.990 --> 04:50.823
Would it cheer you up if we offered
to volunteer a pint tomorrow?

04:51.326 --> 04:53.920
Let's find out.
How about 9:45? That's open.

04:54.096 --> 04:56.428
- Cool.
- There, better already.

04:56.598 --> 04:59.624
Clark, what time can we schedule you?

05:01.136 --> 05:04.367
We didn't pick a time for you yet.
When can I put you down?

05:04.540 --> 05:05.802
Actually, I'm not sure.

05:07.743 --> 05:08.937
Can I get back to you?

05:10.112 --> 05:12.444
Sure, not a problem.

05:12.981 --> 05:15.245
Well, I mean, I figure I could help out.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.248
Sign people up, pass out cookies.

05:17.853 --> 05:20.253
That'd be great. Thanks.

05:21.256 --> 05:22.746
Bye.

05:25.527 --> 05:27.518
Okay, nice recovery.
But am I to assume...

05:27.696 --> 05:31.462
...that your offer to help isn't completely
without an ulterior motive?

05:32.835 --> 05:34.769
I'm just being a good friend.

05:35.838 --> 05:37.305
Okay.

05:38.140 --> 05:40.665
Yes, Daddy, we're on schedule.

05:41.109 --> 05:45.876
Lex is playing hard to get,
but I'm sure I can make him come around.

05:46.915 --> 05:48.576
Bye, Daddy.

05:49.051 --> 05:53.147
He wants to know if you're selling
this castle after we sell out your father.

05:53.322 --> 05:56.723
Why? Does he want to ship it
back over to Scotland?

06:07.503 --> 06:10.131
Amy, where's your mom?

06:10.772 --> 06:13.240
Flu, I think. She asked me
to cover for the afternoon.

06:13.408 --> 06:14.807
Have you met Victoria?

06:15.878 --> 06:19.177
- No, not officially.
- She's gonna be staying with us.

06:22.985 --> 06:24.646
I am so sorry.

06:29.191 --> 06:31.159
I'll go get something to clean this up.

06:32.261 --> 06:34.456
She spilled that on purpose!

06:35.063 --> 06:38.362
That was a mistake. Wasn't it, Amy?

06:38.667 --> 06:40.191
Sure.

06:42.437 --> 06:44.962
She's clearly got a thing for you, Lex.

06:45.374 --> 06:47.399
Never took you for the jealous type.

06:50.412 --> 06:53.904
Her parents are a fixture.
I brought them here from Metropolis.

06:54.082 --> 06:56.312
Then send them back.

07:05.093 --> 07:06.720
Were you just in the house?

07:08.964 --> 07:10.397
Amy.

07:14.036 --> 07:17.403
Amy, I asked you a question.

07:17.906 --> 07:21.137
- What's going on?
- Your sister was bothering Mr. Luthor.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.642
If anyone is bothering him,
it's that tramp.

07:23.812 --> 07:26.212
She's ruining everything.
She wants him all to herself.

07:26.381 --> 07:31.216
We may live on the Luthor estate,
but we're not part of that world.

07:31.386 --> 07:34.116
You have to know your place.

07:34.790 --> 07:36.121
Both of you.

07:36.291 --> 07:39.727
Don't worry, Mom.
We know exactly what our place is.

07:49.871 --> 07:51.771
Thanks, Jeff.

07:52.007 --> 07:53.838
Just be careful.

08:17.466 --> 08:19.024
Clark, what's this?

08:19.201 --> 08:21.897
Blood drive at school.
Lana's running it.

08:22.070 --> 08:24.937
- Clark, you know you can't donate.
- I know, Dad.

08:25.107 --> 08:26.165
What do I tell her?

08:26.341 --> 08:29.242
That you have a problem with needles,
which you technically do.

08:29.911 --> 08:33.745
Great. Not only do I lie,
but I look like a wuss.

08:39.321 --> 08:42.813
I can't even believe
I'm actually gonna say this...

08:43.225 --> 08:46.786
...but I guess you can't always
be honest with people.

08:47.462 --> 08:50.124
It's one of the prices you pay
for your abilities.

08:50.298 --> 08:51.560
That's why I volunteered.

08:51.733 --> 08:55.032
I'm sure it had nothing to do with the fact
that Lana is running it.

08:55.203 --> 08:57.728
- Whitney dropped out.
- So you thought you'd move in.

08:59.574 --> 09:02.566
If he doesn't see how great she is,
then he doesn't deserve her.

09:26.168 --> 09:28.261
Looking for something?

09:29.671 --> 09:31.366
My watch.

09:31.673 --> 09:34.164
- Tulips look great.
- Yeah, you cleaned us out.

09:34.576 --> 09:37.238
Mom said if you want some more,
you have to call Holland.

09:37.746 --> 09:39.213
They're Victoria's favorite.

09:46.588 --> 09:48.249
What was that?

10:04.306 --> 10:06.968
You and Victoria
must be getting pretty close.

10:07.409 --> 10:09.502
You seem surprised.

10:10.345 --> 10:12.973
She just doesn't seem like your type.

10:14.416 --> 10:17.283
Relationships aren't always
about love, Clark.

10:17.452 --> 10:21.479
Sometimes they're about mutual goals.
Not every girl is Lana Lang.

10:23.358 --> 10:25.986
Sorry, it's none of my business, really.

10:27.462 --> 10:29.828
It's okay. I admire your standards.

10:29.998 --> 10:31.761
Don't lose that.

10:36.638 --> 10:38.265
I decided to fight for Lana.

10:41.143 --> 10:43.008
Good for you.

10:43.311 --> 10:45.336
Why the new attitude?

10:45.514 --> 10:47.778
I decided to take the advice of a friend.

10:51.686 --> 10:53.347
Don't you have another watch?

10:54.523 --> 10:56.514
I've got hundreds.

10:57.159 --> 11:01.528
This one's special. My mother gave it
to me right before she died.

11:09.671 --> 11:11.730
I don't see it.

11:12.374 --> 11:14.274
What are you, part bloodhound?

11:15.777 --> 11:18.337
No, I live on a farm.

11:19.314 --> 11:22.374
I'm pretty good at finding needles
in haystacks.

11:24.753 --> 11:26.482
How about I go check the library?

12:01.189 --> 12:02.918
- What's going on?
- Wait here.

13:02.951 --> 13:05.146
Doesn't leave much room
for interpretation.

13:05.987 --> 13:07.477
It was pretty weird.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.283
I mean, the door was shaking.

13:09.457 --> 13:14.360
When we got close, it blew open.
Lex said he felt something brush past him.

13:14.529 --> 13:17.225
Maybe the Scottish castle
came complete with a poltergeist.

13:17.399 --> 13:18.764
The police say it's vandals.

13:18.934 --> 13:22.734
They don't know many ghosts who write
in spray paint and own a black light.

13:26.408 --> 13:28.672
So how's the blood drive?

13:29.144 --> 13:31.203
Lana and I are getting together tonight.

13:31.613 --> 13:33.137
- At her place?
- Yeah.

13:33.415 --> 13:34.905
That's very romantic.

13:37.786 --> 13:39.014
Just remember, Clark...

13:39.187 --> 13:43.851
...once you cross that line, you can't hide
behind the cloak of friendship anymore.

13:44.526 --> 13:46.517
Proceed with caution.

13:55.937 --> 13:57.564
Lex...

13:59.341 --> 14:02.310
...you have disappointed me.

14:02.477 --> 14:05.105
Hi, Dad. It's good to see you too.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.339
Would you mind telling me
what she's doing here?

14:07.515 --> 14:12.418
Right now? Working on my neck.
But knowing her, I think that's just a start.

14:14.656 --> 14:18.820
Could this be a ploy to get my attention?

14:19.127 --> 14:20.617
Well done. It worked.

14:20.795 --> 14:24.663
I know this will come as a shock, but not
everything in my life revolves around you.

14:24.833 --> 14:28.234
I understand.
So you're simply being swindled.

14:31.506 --> 14:34.475
Would you excuse us, Miss Hardwick?

14:34.642 --> 14:38.271
My son and I are gonna have
a little chat about family loyalty.

14:38.613 --> 14:40.205
It's all right.

14:40.715 --> 14:42.979
I'll run us a bath.

14:47.489 --> 14:49.320
I'll be there shortly.

14:51.192 --> 14:54.025
I'll send Sir Harry your regards.

14:54.195 --> 14:55.321
Swell.

14:59.434 --> 15:01.231
This is hardly business.

15:01.436 --> 15:04.428
Generations of Luthors would beg to differ.

15:04.606 --> 15:09.339
It's always business, especially
where the Hardwicks are concerned.

15:09.744 --> 15:13.680
Lex, can't you see
she was sent to distract you?

15:13.848 --> 15:17.306
Sir Harry has been nipping away
at LuthorCorp for months.

15:17.652 --> 15:19.643
LuthorCorp is your company.

15:21.222 --> 15:24.123
I'm just one of its
many expendable employees...

15:24.292 --> 15:27.955
...as you made abundantly clear when
you exiled me to this charming cow town.

15:28.430 --> 15:31.729
Empires are not brought down
by outside forces.

15:31.900 --> 15:35.028
They are destroyed
by weaknesses from within!

15:37.639 --> 15:39.971
Lex, I've told you this...

15:40.141 --> 15:44.271
...Smallville is your test.
Right now, you're failing.

15:44.446 --> 15:46.641
Thanks for the update,
but I know what I'm doing.

15:46.881 --> 15:48.143
No, you don't.

15:48.316 --> 15:52.946
She is playing the only card she's got, and
you are falling for it hook, line and sinker.

15:53.121 --> 15:55.214
My personal life is my business.

15:55.457 --> 15:59.894
Not when it affects my company.
Then it's my business.

16:03.364 --> 16:05.093
Listen to this.

16:05.266 --> 16:11.569
If you sell out your family,
then you will truly be alone in the world.

16:16.511 --> 16:18.376
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-

16:19.848 --> 16:21.839
You don't deserve him.

16:30.258 --> 16:35.127
- Amy, hey, what's wrong?
- Her. What do you think?

16:35.296 --> 16:36.558
Amy?

16:42.670 --> 16:44.035
I've got an opening at 5.

16:44.205 --> 16:47.072
I can shift mine to 4:30 at Station B.

16:47.475 --> 16:49.670
- Which makes us-
- Done.

16:50.111 --> 16:52.705
You're kidding. Everything?

16:52.881 --> 16:54.872
We own this town.

16:56.851 --> 16:59.649
We never found a time for you to donate.

17:01.122 --> 17:05.286
Actually, Lana,
I have a confession to make.

17:06.094 --> 17:08.425
I've got this thing about needles.

17:09.030 --> 17:10.827
It's kind of embarrassing.

17:10.999 --> 17:14.765
Don't worry about it.
Your secret's safe with me.

17:17.505 --> 17:19.871
You are such a lifesaver, Clark.

17:21.009 --> 17:23.409
It's amazing you do
all these different things.

17:23.578 --> 17:25.375
Trying to find my place in the world.

17:28.116 --> 17:29.981
Can't thank you enough.

17:30.585 --> 17:32.576
It's a great cause. How can I not help?

17:33.488 --> 17:35.615
Ask Whitney. He's...

17:37.725 --> 17:39.488
I don't know where he's been lately.

17:39.794 --> 17:42.888
You know, Lana,
if you really want to thank me...

17:43.631 --> 17:45.155
...don't talk about Whitney.

17:47.869 --> 17:49.530
Fair enough.

17:54.042 --> 17:58.809
Did you ever think it's strange that
my dad and your aunt used to date?

17:59.681 --> 18:01.546
Nell doesn't really talk about it much.

18:01.716 --> 18:04.116
Whatever happened,
I guess she took it kind of hard.

18:04.586 --> 18:06.850
I'm just glad that you and I are so close.

18:07.989 --> 18:09.923
Me too.

18:11.693 --> 18:16.153
That's the thing about Clark Kent.
He's not always there when you want him...

18:16.698 --> 18:19.667
...but he's always there
when you need him.

18:21.135 --> 18:22.932
It's a fine distinction.

18:24.038 --> 18:26.905
You're the one who's helping me
with the pledge drive.

18:28.243 --> 18:29.870
I am.

18:32.046 --> 18:34.139
You're the one who listens.

18:37.118 --> 18:38.380
I do.

18:39.721 --> 18:41.188
You're the one who's here.

18:42.023 --> 18:43.422
Yeah.

18:47.028 --> 18:48.222
Lana, you still at it?

18:50.832 --> 18:53.300
Clark, do you have the time?

18:54.302 --> 18:57.396
No, but I'm guessing it's late.

18:57.805 --> 18:59.568
Smart kid.

19:09.350 --> 19:12.217
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

19:17.025 --> 19:19.016
Have you ever seen
the sunset from my loft?

19:19.560 --> 19:20.993
Yes.

19:24.966 --> 19:27.833
But that's the great thing about sunsets.
They're unique.

19:28.002 --> 19:31.802
You always see things
you've never noticed before.

19:33.574 --> 19:35.041
You want to come over tomorrow?

19:35.576 --> 19:37.441
I'd love to.

19:40.815 --> 19:42.510
Good night, Clark.

19:49.157 --> 19:52.615
"Have you seen the sunset from my loft?"
You actually said that?

19:52.794 --> 19:55.160
And I bet your stomach
was in knots the whole time?

19:55.563 --> 19:58.589
If I were you, I'd start scripting
what I was going to say now.

19:58.766 --> 20:01.564
No, I think I'll play it by ear,
fly by the seat of my pants.

20:01.736 --> 20:03.863
Clark, you're not the flying type.

20:04.038 --> 20:05.835
I'll make you some notes.

20:13.114 --> 20:15.708
Whitney, your mother called,
and she filled me in.

20:17.752 --> 20:18.912
She shouldn't have.

20:19.954 --> 20:22.149
Well, Whitney, she was just concerned.

20:23.991 --> 20:25.583
Look, I'm not here to push.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.991
If you need anything,
my office is just down the hall.

20:29.163 --> 20:30.152
Okay?

20:31.299 --> 20:32.994
Okay.

20:49.350 --> 20:51.045
Sorry.

20:51.285 --> 20:52.775
You're welcome.

21:16.477 --> 21:18.945
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Amy.

21:19.247 --> 21:20.771
Is everything okay?

21:20.948 --> 21:23.109
Yeah, just...

21:23.284 --> 21:26.515
...you know, all the weirdness
at the mansion.

21:26.788 --> 21:30.121
Everything was fine
until Victoria got there.

21:31.492 --> 21:35.622
Well, you're Lex's friend.
What do you think of her?

21:35.797 --> 21:37.958
I really don't know her that well.

21:39.400 --> 21:42.460
Well, I think I figured out
why she's sticking around.

21:42.637 --> 21:46.630
I saw her in Lex's bedroom
going through his things.

21:46.808 --> 21:49.641
What were you doing in Lex's bedroom?

21:49.811 --> 21:51.642
Helping my mom.

21:52.847 --> 21:56.248
- And Victoria didn't see you?
- No.

21:58.286 --> 22:03.553
See, Lex is the only one
who ever treated me like I was there.

23:26.507 --> 23:28.441
What brings you over so late?

23:28.609 --> 23:31.134
- Doing a little ghost-hunting?
- No.

23:31.312 --> 23:33.712
I came here to talk to you about Victoria.

23:34.916 --> 23:36.076
Where is she?

23:36.817 --> 23:39.513
She's taking a bath. Why?
Is there a problem?

23:39.687 --> 23:43.623
Last night when I was in here,
I saw her...

23:44.425 --> 23:46.791
I really don't know how to say this.

23:46.961 --> 23:49.361
She was going through the files
on my computer?

23:50.531 --> 23:51.759
Yeah, how'd you know?

23:52.600 --> 23:55.364
Very little happens in this house
without my knowledge.

23:55.636 --> 23:57.467
You don't seem very upset about this.

23:58.406 --> 24:00.931
We're playing chess, Clark.
It's a game.

24:01.108 --> 24:03.269
Like I said, we've known
each other a long time.

24:03.444 --> 24:06.709
Well, you don't love her.
She goes behind your back.

24:07.381 --> 24:11.147
- Why do you want to keep her around?
- It's complicated.

24:11.452 --> 24:12.851
Thanks for the heads up.

24:13.487 --> 24:15.284
That's what friends are for.

24:16.257 --> 24:20.626
I guess I shouldn't even bring up
that Amy's got an obsession with you.

24:21.162 --> 24:24.689
It's a teenage crush, nothing more.

24:24.865 --> 24:26.958
Hey, how goes your new Lana initiative?

24:28.502 --> 24:30.800
I found something out about Whitney.

24:31.505 --> 24:35.498
I saw a prescription in his bag
for Amlodipine. It's a-

24:35.676 --> 24:37.007
Heart medication.

24:40.147 --> 24:42.479
My mother was on it
before she had her surgery.

24:42.650 --> 24:44.049
Is that what...?

24:46.354 --> 24:47.343
I'm sorry.

24:48.789 --> 24:51.553
She was sick for a long time, Clark.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.260
The watch I lost...

24:54.428 --> 24:57.090
...my mom gave it to me
when she knew it was getting close.

25:00.601 --> 25:05.197
She found a Napoleon franc from 1806
and had it made into the face.

25:06.140 --> 25:07.869
Why Napoleon?

25:08.876 --> 25:11.743
<i>You ever see the painting
of Napoleon's Coronation by David?</i>

25:12.246 --> 25:13.372
No.

25:15.449 --> 25:18.976
Napoleon's mother couldn't make it
to his coronation.

25:19.186 --> 25:24.385
But when he commissioned it, Napoleon told
David to paint her in as if she were there...

25:24.558 --> 25:26.321
...right in the center.

25:27.161 --> 25:29.254
Even though she couldn't
be there physically...

25:29.430 --> 25:32.194
...he brought her into his life
through sheer force of will.

25:32.767 --> 25:34.928
There to share in his greatness.

25:36.871 --> 25:38.805
It's a good story.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.774
It's a good watch.

25:59.860 --> 26:01.327
Lex?

26:45.106 --> 26:47.006
You're gonna be okay.

27:15.202 --> 27:16.863
It's definitely blood.

27:17.037 --> 27:19.505
Doesn't exactly fit the Casper paradigm.

27:19.673 --> 27:23.541
Which means that whoever attacked
you and Victoria in the bathroom...

27:23.711 --> 27:25.372
...was invisible?

27:33.254 --> 27:35.848
What's this green stuff?

27:36.757 --> 27:38.418
It smells like roses.

27:45.900 --> 27:47.026
What happened?

27:47.201 --> 27:48.532
I just touched it.

27:50.204 --> 27:53.105
Okay, I'm now officially weirded out.

27:53.274 --> 27:54.571
What is this?

27:54.842 --> 27:57.072
If you rubbed that all over your body,
you'd be-

27:57.244 --> 27:58.506
Naked?

27:59.146 --> 28:00.443
You'd be invisible.

28:11.692 --> 28:14.092
So, what's our next move?
Should we call the police?

28:14.261 --> 28:16.422
And report an invisible person?

28:16.697 --> 28:18.324
We need a viable suspect.

28:18.499 --> 28:21.161
Well, who's got a problem
with Lex's British fling?

28:21.335 --> 28:22.324
Amy Palmer.

28:22.503 --> 28:24.528
Her parents are on the mansion's
house staff.

28:24.705 --> 28:27.230
Amy said she saw Victoria
snooping in Lex's bedroom.

28:27.408 --> 28:29.638
- She said Victoria didn't see her.
- No wonder.

28:29.810 --> 28:33.246
- Wait. Didn't Amy give blood?
-3:45, Station B.

28:33.948 --> 28:37.042
You've got a freakishly good memory.

28:37.818 --> 28:42.755
Okay, I'll get the blood type on the broken
piece of glass and check it against Amy's.

28:43.357 --> 28:45.917
- Call me later?
- Top of my speed-dial.

29:06.614 --> 29:09.447
Whatever it is, I'm not interested.

29:10.584 --> 29:14.247
What about Lana?
You interested in her?

29:14.822 --> 29:18.280
- What is it with you and my girlfriend, Kent?
- Nothing.

29:19.360 --> 29:21.123
We're just friends.

29:21.295 --> 29:24.321
- Think I don't see how you look at her?
- At least I pay attention.

29:25.733 --> 29:28.497
You've got an unbelievable girlfriend,
and you don't even know it.

29:28.669 --> 29:32.230
- What's your problem?
- How I deal with my girl is my business.

29:32.406 --> 29:34.135
Okay?

29:36.510 --> 29:39.411
I saw the heart medication in your bag.

29:41.382 --> 29:42.872
What's going on, Whitney?

29:48.722 --> 29:50.212
It's my dad.

29:50.524 --> 29:53.789
He's been in Metropolis all week,
you know, for tests.

29:53.961 --> 29:56.225
Is he gonna be okay?

29:56.497 --> 29:58.089
Doctors don't know.

30:02.670 --> 30:05.332
You haven't told Lana yet, have you?

30:07.007 --> 30:09.771
She's been through enough pain
in her life with her parents.

30:09.944 --> 30:12.174
I didn't want her to go
through it with me.

30:21.155 --> 30:23.555
I don't think you give her
enough credit.

30:25.426 --> 30:26.916
She's strong.

30:27.094 --> 30:29.460
She'd probably understand
better than anyone.

30:45.446 --> 30:47.971
Hey, how's Victoria?

30:49.416 --> 30:53.580
She's resting up in Metropolis for a few days
until I can get some answers.

30:57.024 --> 30:58.389
Everything okay?

30:58.926 --> 31:00.917
You ever gotten information
you wish you hadn't?

31:01.795 --> 31:05.424
In my experience, there's no such thing
as too much information.

31:05.599 --> 31:07.658
I assume you're talking
about the quarterback?

31:08.168 --> 31:09.635
His father's sick.

31:11.638 --> 31:13.731
That's too bad.

31:15.142 --> 31:17.303
I wanted to take my shot
with Lana, but now-

31:17.478 --> 31:19.343
You feel like you'd be taking advantage.

31:20.647 --> 31:25.107
- What would you do?
- Who, me? I'd go for it.

31:25.719 --> 31:28.984
See, but that's what I like about
you, Clark. You wouldn't.

31:32.526 --> 31:34.221
Hi, Lex.

31:34.628 --> 31:37.256
Amy, this is a surprise.

31:37.431 --> 31:42.630
Well, I just saw your car outside,
so I thought I'd come in and say hi.

31:43.937 --> 31:46.132
Well, I appreciate the gesture.

31:47.374 --> 31:51.105
So now that Miss Hardwick's gone,
hopefully things will be back to normal.

31:51.278 --> 31:53.974
Victoria will be back in a few days.

31:56.817 --> 31:58.876
She's really not as bad as you think.

31:59.286 --> 32:02.414
I never thought that.

32:05.059 --> 32:07.084
Well, bye.

32:15.335 --> 32:16.563
What is it?

32:17.137 --> 32:19.628
I don't know what to say, Mr. Luthor.

32:20.874 --> 32:22.899
Amy's been having trouble in school...

32:23.077 --> 32:26.046
...but I can't imagine
she'd try to hurt Miss Hardwick.

32:34.988 --> 32:36.546
I hope I'm wrong.

32:45.332 --> 32:48.165
Looks like she's been collecting you.

32:52.673 --> 32:54.231
My watch.

32:55.442 --> 32:58.206
We had no idea, Mr. Luthor.

32:59.346 --> 33:01.075
Please don't call the police.

33:02.683 --> 33:08.019
I'm not interested in retribution or publicity,
but Amy needs help.

33:08.188 --> 33:11.851
Counseling, medical treatment,
whatever it takes, just send me the bill.

33:12.726 --> 33:16.184
Even so, I think it'd be best for everyone
if you left the mansion tonight.

33:16.530 --> 33:18.191
Yes, of course.

33:46.393 --> 33:47.883
You made it.

33:48.829 --> 33:50.091
Sorry I'm late.

33:50.464 --> 33:52.432
It's just getting to the good part.

34:02.409 --> 34:03.740
What do you think?

34:05.979 --> 34:08.812
I think it's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

34:14.521 --> 34:19.185
The other night on the porch,
I felt you were trying to tell me something.

34:19.359 --> 34:20.882
I was.

34:21.995 --> 34:25.123
But Nell's timing was impeccable,
as always.

34:27.701 --> 34:29.760
She's not here now.

34:32.339 --> 34:35.137
What I wanted to tell you was...

34:39.780 --> 34:41.577
What I wanted to say was...

34:46.485 --> 34:48.976
...I would never do anything to hurt you.

34:49.156 --> 34:50.487
I know that.

34:51.658 --> 34:55.116
But if I said what I really wanted
to say right now, that's what I'd do.

34:55.295 --> 34:56.420
I'd hurt you.

34:58.031 --> 35:00.397
Why don't you take a shot?

35:00.634 --> 35:02.499
I'm pretty strong.

35:02.669 --> 35:06.435
I know, but I think Whitney
needs to know that too.

35:07.074 --> 35:10.066
I thought you didn't want
to talk about Whitney.

35:14.781 --> 35:16.442
I don't.

35:18.318 --> 35:21.617
But if you were my girlfriend
standing in Whitney's loft...

35:21.788 --> 35:24.120
...I'd hope he'd say the same thing.

35:27.728 --> 35:29.958
I understand you're mad at him...

35:30.130 --> 35:34.396
...but you need to talk to him. He needs
you right now. He just doesn't know it.

35:36.270 --> 35:38.898
Clark, why are you doing this?

35:44.945 --> 35:50.178
Because after all this time, you and I are
finally friends, and I don't wanna lose that.

35:59.760 --> 36:00.818
Look.

36:03.397 --> 36:05.024
We missed it.

36:44.004 --> 36:47.770
I just wanted to feel close to you.

37:02.989 --> 37:05.116
Jeff is gonna pack everything else.

37:05.292 --> 37:08.261
My husband will be back
in the morning to pick it up.

37:09.262 --> 37:13.028
- Again, Mr. Luthor, I-
- It's okay. It's okay.

37:13.367 --> 37:15.358
Drive safely.

37:37.758 --> 37:40.556
Yes, I'd like to leave a message
for Victoria Hardwick.

37:45.966 --> 37:47.627
Who's there?

37:49.136 --> 37:51.104
Come out and show yourself.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.779
How'd it go with Lana?

38:10.390 --> 38:12.153
We're still friends.

38:12.325 --> 38:15.726
- Are you okay with that?
- No.

38:16.663 --> 38:19.291
But I think it's the right call for now.

38:21.601 --> 38:22.590
Hello?

38:23.970 --> 38:25.597
Hey, Mrs. Kent.

38:25.772 --> 38:27.899
Hi, Chloe. Well, I'll see you later.

38:29.209 --> 38:32.406
Okay, so, bad news on the Dracula front.

38:32.579 --> 38:34.547
The drop of blood
on the mirror was type A.

38:34.714 --> 38:35.942
Amy Palmer was type O.

38:36.316 --> 38:38.716
But she had a shrine
to Lex in her room.

38:38.885 --> 38:42.412
She may be a little Lex-obsessed, but
she's not the one that tried to off Victoria.

38:42.589 --> 38:44.454
Check the paper.

38:47.027 --> 38:49.587
Amy's blood type doesn't match,
but look at Jeff's.

38:49.996 --> 38:52.260
Her brother?
He's always been so quiet.

38:52.966 --> 38:54.399
Practically invisible.

38:55.936 --> 38:58.063
I'll catch up with you later.

39:04.911 --> 39:09.678
Don't you understand? She loved you.

39:09.850 --> 39:12.444
How could you send her away?

39:13.253 --> 39:16.518
- Who are you?
- Suddenly, you care.

39:16.690 --> 39:21.150
Master Lex with his castle,
his plant, his expensive cars.

39:21.328 --> 39:24.320
When did people ever mattered to you?

39:24.931 --> 39:26.694
Jeff?

39:28.068 --> 39:29.865
Where are you?

39:34.741 --> 39:37.232
Servants are supposed to be invisible.

39:37.811 --> 39:41.474
We tried to hide,
fade into the woodwork.

39:41.648 --> 39:45.243
My parents lived with it, pretended
it didn't matter, but Amy wanted more.

39:45.418 --> 39:47.113
And I'm through pretending!

39:52.759 --> 39:54.693
What have I ever done to you?

39:58.298 --> 40:00.960
You threw her out like she was nothing.

40:01.134 --> 40:05.468
- I thought she was attacking Victoria.
- That was me. I wanted to scare her.

40:05.639 --> 40:07.004
Make her leave.

40:07.173 --> 40:11.473
I wanted everything back to the way it was
for Amy, but you're not interested in love.

40:11.645 --> 40:14.079
That kind of love could get me arrested.

40:14.247 --> 40:16.738
She's a little young for me, Jeff.

40:16.917 --> 40:19.886
You ruined her life!

40:20.053 --> 40:22.078
Our lives!

40:22.255 --> 40:24.917
I'm not gonna let you hurt her again!

40:37.070 --> 40:39.163
Lex! It's me. Open up!

40:49.449 --> 40:51.849
Stay away from him, Kent.

40:55.021 --> 40:57.080
This is your fault too.

40:58.558 --> 41:01.527
Jeff, what happened?

41:01.761 --> 41:03.820
Chemistry, Kent.

41:03.997 --> 41:07.125
Some plants don't absorb light,
they refract it.

41:07.300 --> 41:10.428
I found a weird green rose
on the grounds, and I studied it.

41:10.604 --> 41:13.971
And then I used the oils
to become what I've always been...

41:14.608 --> 41:16.940
...to Lex, to the people at school...

41:17.110 --> 41:18.441
...everyone.

41:29.155 --> 41:31.385
Like you're something special.

41:31.558 --> 41:33.753
Well, I'm special too.

42:02.422 --> 42:04.686
What do you think's
gonna happen to Jeff?

42:04.858 --> 42:07.156
A lot of serious therapy.

42:07.827 --> 42:10.819
The bigger question is
how he made himself invisible.

42:10.997 --> 42:14.364
I don't know. I guess
the secret's gonna stay with him.

42:14.701 --> 42:17.829
- How's your head?
- I've survived worse.

42:18.104 --> 42:20.732
Can't say the same about
my father's antique collection.

42:20.907 --> 42:23.467
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

42:23.643 --> 42:25.736
My mother always hated that room.

42:25.912 --> 42:29.780
"War's in our nature," she said.
"We don't need to put it on display."
