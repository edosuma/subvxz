01:35.078 --> 01:36.670
Get out of the way!

01:36.846 --> 01:38.336
This way!

01:44.721 --> 01:47.554
Saint Luke's Hospital.
I repeat, Saint Luke's Hospital.

01:47.724 --> 01:49.692
Does anything hurt?

01:50.360 --> 01:52.590
Sweetheart, is your mommy here?

01:52.762 --> 01:54.354
Do you know where she is?

02:03.206 --> 02:06.437
Really, I'm just... No.

02:06.609 --> 02:08.633
Don't come over.

02:10.079 --> 02:13.879
No. No, I swear
I wasn't just seeing things.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.947
I mean, it could have just been a prank.

02:18.288 --> 02:20.222
I don't know who.

02:21.758 --> 02:25.159
No, really, I'm just gonna see you
at school tomorrow.

02:27.163 --> 02:28.790
Thanks, Leann.

02:30.633 --> 02:31.964
Bye.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.995
Luna?

03:11.474 --> 03:12.805
Luna?

05:31.247 --> 05:32.578
Come on.
Over here.

05:32.749 --> 05:35.575
Beth's a little too sane for me,
but she does throw a good party.

05:35.718 --> 05:38.448
Yeah, so now I'm having sex
and phone sex at the same time.

05:38.621 --> 05:40.418
Oh, man. Are you serious?

05:43.359 --> 05:47.318
I know, but he was just so handsome.

05:47.497 --> 05:49.658
And I was so nervous, you know?

05:49.832 --> 05:53.324
<i>And I'm trying to describe
the plot of Beloved to him...</i>

05:53.503 --> 05:55.061
...and I just started crying.

05:55.238 --> 05:58.503
It was a perfect year, wasn't it?
I loved it.

06:01.077 --> 06:05.343
Brian, could you get your eyes off Taylor
for two seconds and help me with this?

06:08.017 --> 06:09.780
Unbelievable.

06:09.952 --> 06:14.252
And before the sheets are even cold.
No wonder why Leann moved out.

06:14.424 --> 06:18.326
I am a man. I have needs.
Is that a problem for you?

06:19.462 --> 06:22.295
No. But it might be a problem for Taylor.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.956
Hot. Yes, well...

06:25.134 --> 06:28.331
...we can't force Taylor
to have good taste, now can we?

06:28.905 --> 06:31.066
Just keep chopping.

06:31.674 --> 06:33.642
I'll keep chopping.

06:39.715 --> 06:44.084
You know, I can hear you analyzing me in
your head. You might as well do it out loud.

06:44.854 --> 06:48.051
Okay, I think that
you're still messed up over Leann.

06:48.224 --> 06:50.021
You think if you flirt with Taylor...

06:50.193 --> 06:53.128
...maybe Leann'll get jealous
and come back to you.

06:53.996 --> 06:57.124
Go back to analyzing me in your head.
I think I like that better.

07:02.171 --> 07:04.833
Hey, did someone lock the door?

07:30.533 --> 07:32.967
- Hey, Leann. Hi.
- Hi.

07:33.136 --> 07:35.195
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

07:35.371 --> 07:38.568
- Me too.
- Is... Is Brian home?

07:38.741 --> 07:41.676
Yeah, he's in the kitchen,
so we should go upstairs.

07:45.648 --> 07:47.548
How you doing?

07:52.255 --> 07:53.882
Oh. Oh.

07:55.224 --> 07:56.657
Hey, it's Leann.

07:56.826 --> 07:58.157
Bye.

08:02.732 --> 08:06.429
Okay. Just leave the alarm off. Thanks.

08:13.176 --> 08:14.734
Hey.

08:16.012 --> 08:17.809
How was it?

08:18.748 --> 08:22.115
It was a funeral. It sucked.

08:23.553 --> 08:26.750
From now on, I only go to parties
where no one gets cremated.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.990
How are Shelley's parents?

08:30.159 --> 08:34.755
Considering their 24-year-old daughter
drowned in the backyard pond...

08:35.097 --> 08:36.188
...they're great.

08:37.832 --> 08:38.993
And you?

08:39.902 --> 08:42.597
I knew Shelley.
We interned at Saint Luke's together.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.706
I mean, she was not crazy.

08:44.874 --> 08:47.934
I know, but the way she was
talking at the end was pretty...

08:48.110 --> 08:50.169
Yeah, that doesn't mean
she killed herself.

08:54.684 --> 08:56.549
That's not my ringtone.

09:06.162 --> 09:07.959
It says it's from Shelley.

09:08.731 --> 09:11.063
Who'd be calling from Shelley's phone?

09:15.037 --> 09:17.130
That's creepy.

09:19.041 --> 09:21.339
It's dated Monday, 10:17 p. m.

09:24.447 --> 09:27.746
It's Friday. Maybe you just
set the date wrong.

09:40.363 --> 09:42.297
Leann, what is it?

09:43.532 --> 09:45.090
Leann?

09:53.542 --> 09:55.908
<i>If you'd like to hear this message
again...</i>

09:56.078 --> 09:57.511
<i>...press one.</i>

09:58.481 --> 10:03.783
<i>Voice call received Monday,
June 12th, 10: 17 p. m.</i>

10:03.953 --> 10:07.912
<i>I don't know,
it's the weirdest, weirdest thing.</i>

10:08.090 --> 10:12.220
<i>It's like every time I
turn around, they're...</i>

10:13.796 --> 10:17.562
<i>No! Aaah!</i>

10:20.069 --> 10:22.230
That's your voice.

10:23.272 --> 10:25.206
That's you.

10:35.084 --> 10:36.108
<i>Yeah?
Yeah.</i>

10:36.285 --> 10:37.459
<i>Cut me a break, man.</i>

10:37.460 --> 10:40.388
<i>No, man, you know what the price is.
You gotta hit it right.</i>

10:40.389 --> 10:41.754
<i>All right. Give me that.</i>

10:41.924 --> 10:43.551
<i>All right, slow down, homie.</i>

10:44.827 --> 10:46.226
Okay?

10:46.796 --> 10:49.959
Yeah. They're real nice.

10:55.638 --> 10:58.971
Detective Andrews. Yeah.

11:00.209 --> 11:02.439
<i>A group of hikers found her.</i>

11:02.611 --> 11:07.275
We held off on the autopsy
until you got here, detective.

11:07.450 --> 11:13.480
Even so, your sister was out
there for more than a week.

11:14.023 --> 11:16.958
There's really no need for you to do this.

11:46.088 --> 11:47.385
Whew.

12:00.403 --> 12:02.769
Oh, jeez.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.739
In cases of severe and repeated
childhood abuse...

12:46.315 --> 12:49.182
...the posttraumatic-stress model
may be valid.

12:49.351 --> 12:52.878
Long-term effects may include
sexual dysfunction, amnesia...

12:53.055 --> 12:58.618
...dissociation, even hallucinations
and multiple personalities.

12:58.961 --> 13:00.952
The post-trauma child...

13:01.130 --> 13:04.190
...faces formidable developmental tasks...

13:04.366 --> 13:08.996
...and among these what we call
"dissociative virtuosity. "

13:11.173 --> 13:15.701
The post-trauma child
will form primary attachments...

13:15.878 --> 13:18.005
...to develop a sense of basic trust...

13:18.180 --> 13:22.708
...and to preserve a sense
of hope and meaning in life.

13:24.286 --> 13:28.120
The child will, from this experience,
attempt to...

13:28.290 --> 13:32.420
...construct an explanation
of what's happened.

13:32.995 --> 13:38.592
And these explanations may excuse
the parental negligence or abuse.

13:38.767 --> 13:42.726
The child may blame themselves
for what has happened.

13:46.909 --> 13:50.868
Look, if you come over
earlier then we can study some more.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.481
Leann!

13:54.650 --> 13:57.744
Hey. Do you wanna
go get some coffee?

13:57.920 --> 14:00.320
No. No. I've...

14:01.123 --> 14:04.991
...gotta get to the library.
Paper's due next week.

14:05.427 --> 14:08.089
Are you okay?
You seem kind of weirded-out.

14:08.998 --> 14:11.023
I haven't been sleeping too well.

14:12.067 --> 14:14.035
Call me tonight.
I'll read you my paper...

14:14.203 --> 14:18.037
...on developmental perspectives
in abuse cases. It's better than Ambien.

14:20.409 --> 14:23.037
Okay. Bye.

14:25.347 --> 14:27.008
Bye.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.682
<i>The library will be closing in five
minutes.</i>

15:20.869 --> 15:23.531
- Hey, Lee.
- Hey.

15:23.706 --> 15:25.139
Hey, what's up?

15:25.307 --> 15:28.367
Oh, I'm just finishing up this paper.
What are you doing?

15:29.812 --> 15:34.977
I just got sprung from the stacks.
My brain was mushing out.

15:35.150 --> 15:36.947
<i>Oh, God, I know what you mean.</i>

15:45.094 --> 15:46.561
<i>Leann?</i>

15:47.796 --> 15:50.196
<i>Leann? Hello?</i>

15:50.366 --> 15:55.633
Listen, Beth, I didn't mean to ditch you
after class today. I...

16:05.948 --> 16:07.426
<i>Leann, are you still there?</i>

16:08.751 --> 16:12.482
I don't know how to explain it.
L... I've been...

16:13.555 --> 16:16.752
<i>- I've been having some problems.
- What kind of problems?</i>

16:20.496 --> 16:22.361
Ever since I...

16:22.531 --> 16:23.793
Well, I don't know.

16:24.266 --> 16:28.327
I mean, Shelley drowned,
and that was my voice screaming.

16:29.571 --> 16:34.736
And then that bizarre phone call,
and it was dated today.

16:36.445 --> 16:38.140
10:17 p. m.

16:44.153 --> 16:46.178
- I don't...
- Where are you?

16:46.355 --> 16:49.290
I'm at the overpass on College.

16:50.859 --> 16:52.952
That's two minutes away.
I'll be right there.

16:53.128 --> 16:57.656
I keep seeing things. I mean,
weird people looking at me.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.758
<i>- Leann?
- I'm sorry.</i>

16:59.935 --> 17:02.199
I didn't mean to panic. I've just...

17:02.371 --> 17:05.271
I've been seeing
some really strange stuff.

17:06.675 --> 17:10.474
I don't know,
it's the weirdest, weirdest thing.

17:10.646 --> 17:13.342
<i>Every time I turn around, they're...</i>

17:24.193 --> 17:25.217
Leann!

17:28.797 --> 17:30.196
- No! No!
- Leann!

18:17.279 --> 18:20.544
Didn't see anything?
Like I said, she threw herself off.

18:20.983 --> 18:23.110
Please, can we go?
This is taking so long.

18:23.285 --> 18:26.220
You're gonna have to stay here
until I get all the information.

18:26.388 --> 18:28.219
I need you to sign this statement.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.659
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:38.734 --> 18:41.134
And then she got this strange phone call.

18:41.303 --> 18:42.600
It's hard to believe.

18:42.771 --> 18:46.434
Yeah, Leann told me the same thing
happened to Shelley before she drowned.

18:46.608 --> 18:48.269
- That is so eerie.
Taylor.

18:49.511 --> 18:53.208
What? I'm just saying what Leann said.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.873
Yeah, well, maybe this isn't the time,
all right?

18:56.819 --> 19:00.380
I heard Shelley got a phone call
from an old advisor of hers.

19:00.556 --> 19:03.719
I heard that too. Only it turned out
the advisor was already dead.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.621
Would you stop it?

19:06.895 --> 19:08.829
Her parents are right in the other room.

19:13.235 --> 19:16.602
It's like dead people call you,
but it's your own voice.

19:16.772 --> 19:18.467
And then you die too.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.000
Shit, Taylor, know what?

19:21.176 --> 19:24.577
Don't try to think, all right?
It just makes you look ridiculous.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.184
I heard it too.

19:31.386 --> 19:33.946
That's it. Now I'm really creeped out.

19:34.122 --> 19:37.751
It's shit, all right? It's total bullshit.

19:50.672 --> 19:52.902
Brian! Brian!

19:53.075 --> 19:55.236
What's his problem?

19:55.711 --> 19:57.838
He had a thing for Leann.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.506
Brian.

20:35.117 --> 20:37.085
Are you okay?

20:37.252 --> 20:38.879
What was that back there?

20:51.433 --> 20:55.369
<i>To listen to your messages, press
one.</i>

20:56.338 --> 20:59.774
<i>Voice call received
Wednesday, June 14th...</i>

20:59.942 --> 21:02.775
<i>...12:02 p. m.</i>

21:02.945 --> 21:06.075
<i>Damn it, I forgot. I swear if I
didn't have my head screwed on...</i>

21:13.021 --> 21:15.854
The call came in two nights ago.
From Leann's phone.

21:16.024 --> 21:19.858
- That was the night that she died.
- Only the call was dated Wednesday.

21:20.028 --> 21:23.691
Today. 12:02 p. m.

21:24.933 --> 21:27.800
I don't believe in magic, Beth.

21:28.170 --> 21:32.903
I don't believe in anything. But ever since
I got that phone call, things have been...

21:34.276 --> 21:36.210
...weird.
- Like what?

21:39.881 --> 21:41.348
No, Brian, you have to tell me.

21:41.516 --> 21:44.883
That's the exact same thing
that Leann told me right before she...

21:47.956 --> 21:49.150
Brian?

21:51.793 --> 21:53.784
What's wrong? Brian?

21:59.401 --> 22:01.028
Look...

22:02.304 --> 22:04.067
- What's...?
- Forget about it, okay?

22:04.272 --> 22:06.103
- No, Brian, don't!
- These things work...

22:06.274 --> 22:09.937
...because they get in your head, Beth.
You're the psych lady, you know that.

22:10.112 --> 22:12.155
If you don't think about it,
it can't hurt you.

22:19.321 --> 22:21.221
Like I said.

22:38.907 --> 22:41.273
Brian, your phone!

22:41.443 --> 22:43.377
You forgot your phone.

22:48.650 --> 22:51.476
Damn it, I forgot. I swear if I
didn't have my head screwed on...

23:11.907 --> 23:13.306
Let's go over this again.

23:13.475 --> 23:17.878
Welder's acetylene tank exploded.
Your friend happened to be in the way.

23:18.046 --> 23:20.742
Okay. And what about
Leann and the voice mails?

23:20.916 --> 23:24.215
We checked on that. There were no
voice mails on your friends' phones.

23:24.386 --> 23:27.287
- Either of them.
- But I heard them. Okay?

23:27.456 --> 23:31.358
Leann got a phone call, and so did Brian,
right before they died.

23:32.194 --> 23:34.219
Both of them did.

23:34.396 --> 23:37.729
I hear it happened to Shelley too,
Shelley Baum, right before she died.

23:38.467 --> 23:40.492
Well, thank you, Miss Raymond.

23:40.669 --> 23:44.901
We'll check on that, and we'll contact you
if we need anything else.

23:49.644 --> 23:51.373
What about the hard candies?

23:51.546 --> 23:54.276
Both of these kids were eating them.
My sister too.

23:54.449 --> 23:57.009
Three people eating hard candy
in two weeks?

23:57.185 --> 24:00.780
The girl's right, Mickey. There's gotta be
some kind of connection here.

24:00.956 --> 24:03.948
You know,
I'm really sorry about your sister.

24:04.126 --> 24:06.390
But if it was my sister...

24:06.661 --> 24:11.758
...I'd take some personal time,
just till I was thinking right again.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.199
Excuse me, Miss Raymond?

24:19.841 --> 24:22.105
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

24:22.277 --> 24:24.973
I'm Detective Jack Andrews. I heard
what you were saying...

24:25.147 --> 24:27.513
...and, well, Detective Lee's a good cop...

24:27.682 --> 24:30.116
...but she's a little short
on imagination, you know?

24:30.285 --> 24:33.220
- What are you saying?
- I don't really know.

24:33.388 --> 24:37.449
Except Shelley Baum interned
with my sister at Saint Luke's.

24:37.626 --> 24:41.323
My sister Jean, she died in a fall
two days before Shelley drowned.

24:41.496 --> 24:44.124
Oh, I'm sorry.
But then, you see what I'm saying.

24:44.299 --> 24:46.995
Everybody seems to be
linked together somehow.

24:47.169 --> 24:49.899
Something doesn't make sense here so...

24:50.238 --> 24:53.605
...if you can think of anything else,
give me a call.

26:07.849 --> 26:09.373
You didn't get a call, did you?

26:11.753 --> 26:14.654
But my number was in Brian's cell.

26:17.125 --> 26:19.457
I'm gonna be next.

26:21.229 --> 26:22.787
I can feel it.

26:22.964 --> 26:25.023
No, you don't know that, okay?

26:25.200 --> 26:28.567
Because my number is in Brian's cell too.
Here.

26:31.339 --> 26:35.105
No power, no problem.

26:37.545 --> 26:39.376
Any dead people call...

26:42.450 --> 26:44.213
...we're not home.

27:21.089 --> 27:22.852
- Which one is it?
- Uh!

27:34.436 --> 27:35.460
Who?

27:55.357 --> 27:57.120
Oh, God.

27:57.892 --> 27:59.189
Oh, God.

27:59.361 --> 28:01.795
This can't be happening.

28:12.574 --> 28:15.042
There are no batteries.

28:18.780 --> 28:21.476
It says 8:32 p. m. On Friday.

28:22.617 --> 28:25.211
That's two days from now.

28:39.434 --> 28:41.664
Everything I'm seeing is there. It's real.

28:41.836 --> 28:43.531
I'm seeing it and it's happening...

28:46.107 --> 28:49.634
I do not. Okay?

28:54.983 --> 28:57.315
Okay, you wanna delete it? Do it yourself.

28:59.120 --> 29:02.180
Look, I'm... I'm sure you'll be fine.

29:03.224 --> 29:06.660
I wanna do mine.
- You wanna do it too? Go ahead.

29:10.231 --> 29:12.324
Go on, you can all do it.

29:12.934 --> 29:14.367
There you go.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.736
- That's a...
- Wait.

29:22.510 --> 29:24.569
Sorry, ladies.
It just doesn't work that way.

29:24.746 --> 29:27.408
Right. You're telling me
that we can't cancel the service?

29:27.582 --> 29:30.016
You don't have to cancel.
Just use up your minutes.

29:30.185 --> 29:33.621
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
We don't wanna use this phone at all.

29:33.788 --> 29:37.588
Well, the phone is yours, so you
can do whatever you want with it.

30:06.621 --> 30:08.418
Miss Anthony?

30:08.590 --> 30:11.218
- Taylor Anthony?
- Yeah.

30:11.392 --> 30:13.189
Ted Summers.

30:13.361 --> 30:17.923
<i>I'm a television producer. I work
on the program American Miracles.</i>

30:18.099 --> 30:19.430
Oh, I've heard of that.

30:19.801 --> 30:21.132
Yeah.

30:21.302 --> 30:23.395
Some students called us
about what happened...

30:23.571 --> 30:25.539
...and they told us
all about your problem.

30:25.707 --> 30:30.041
- Can we help you with something? We're...
- We were very moved by your story, Taylor.

30:30.211 --> 30:33.669
- We think we might be able to help you.
- How?

30:33.848 --> 30:38.512
About five years ago,
my son suffered a possession.

30:42.023 --> 30:45.356
Yeah. It was pretty devastating
for the whole family.

30:45.527 --> 30:49.258
So when I created my show,
I wanted to make it a point...

30:49.430 --> 30:52.263
...to build an extensive resource
of people who were able...

30:52.433 --> 30:56.961
...to deal successfully
with those evil influences like that.

30:57.138 --> 30:59.470
What do you mean,
like, you do exorcisms?

30:59.641 --> 31:03.509
- I think this is nonsense.
- Do you have the telephone on you, Taylor?

31:04.145 --> 31:07.444
- What? No, we threw it away.
- Do you have the phone?

31:07.615 --> 31:11.312
Well, it would really be helpful.
Here. Here.

31:11.486 --> 31:13.716
Now, you show me...

31:13.888 --> 31:16.322
...exactly what happened
when the phone call came in.

31:16.491 --> 31:18.118
Okay, come here. Nope, nope.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.818
Thank you very much.
This is ridiculous. Thank you.

31:20.995 --> 31:23.125
- We don't need a reality show.
- I understand...

31:23.298 --> 31:25.163
...you wanna protect your friend.
- I do.

31:25.333 --> 31:26.594
- I admire that.
- Thank you.

31:38.947 --> 31:41.507
- Come on, let's go.
- Jesus.

31:41.983 --> 31:43.644
Come on, come on.

31:46.621 --> 31:48.521
Wait, we could s...

31:49.991 --> 31:51.982
Hey, maybe he could help me, Beth.

31:52.160 --> 31:56.324
No, Taylor, you don't need an exorcism.
Okay?

31:56.497 --> 31:59.227
That guy was so full of it.

32:54.255 --> 32:55.313
Andrews.

33:43.938 --> 33:48.068
Miss Raymond, it is not your
imagination. The phone calls happened.

33:48.242 --> 33:50.938
The other detective said
nobody could find the voice mails.

33:51.112 --> 33:54.411
Because the other detective
didn't bother to check the phone records.

33:54.582 --> 33:56.447
I did, and it's all right there.

33:56.617 --> 34:01.179
Brian was called by Leann, Leann
was called by Shelley, and Shelley...

34:01.355 --> 34:03.380
...was called from my sister.

34:04.025 --> 34:07.324
All right? And all the calls came in
after the caller was already dead.

34:07.495 --> 34:09.292
Right. Who called your sister?

34:09.464 --> 34:12.797
If we could trace it to the source
and find out who started this, then...

34:12.967 --> 34:15.629
I was up all night tracking it.
I'm gonna go see her now.

34:15.803 --> 34:17.411
- I'll give you a call. Okay?
- Okay.

34:17.572 --> 34:19.904
- I'm gonna come with you.
- That's not a good idea.

34:20.074 --> 34:24.773
Yeah, it is, because these are my friends
and there's no way I'm gonna sit here.

34:27.348 --> 34:30.112
The call my sister got
came from a nurse at an old-age home.

34:30.284 --> 34:31.717
A woman named Marie Layton.

34:38.559 --> 34:40.789
It's right up here on the right.

34:50.071 --> 34:51.697
I wouldn't hold my breath.

34:51.873 --> 34:55.434
Nobody's been in there for
more than two weeks now, not a soul.

34:56.110 --> 34:58.601
Okay. Thank you very much.

35:09.590 --> 35:13.117
You know, I'm gonna go get the super.

35:13.594 --> 35:15.926
That could take hours.
Why don't you just break in?

35:16.531 --> 35:17.725
I'm a cop.

35:18.599 --> 35:20.533
I'm not.

35:24.605 --> 35:26.630
All right, give it a shot.

35:35.616 --> 35:36.640
Okay.

35:39.120 --> 35:40.417
I was getting it.

36:08.449 --> 36:12.545
Well, whoever Marie Layton is,
she's a hell of a housekeeper, huh?

36:22.930 --> 36:28.596
<i>We're not... We're not...
We're not... We're not...</i>

38:23.584 --> 38:26.348
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

38:33.094 --> 38:35.289
I found this in the living room.

38:36.530 --> 38:39.363
It must be one of those nanny cams.

38:39.767 --> 38:42.327
To keep an eye on the children.

38:47.008 --> 38:53.140
Okay, so judging from the angle, the
camera would have been right here.

38:57.718 --> 38:59.549
So where did it go?

39:21.342 --> 39:22.866
Beth.

39:23.044 --> 39:26.377
Look, if you don't talk to me,
I can't help you.

39:26.547 --> 39:31.416
That noise, the inhaler. I heard it
both times, before Leann and Brian...

39:31.585 --> 39:34.145
Then when I looked behind me,
there was nobody there.

39:36.557 --> 39:38.889
What the hell is happening?

39:39.326 --> 39:42.193
This is the morgue file of the dead
from the last month or so.

39:42.363 --> 39:44.888
If Marie Layton died,
she did it in another city.

39:45.066 --> 39:47.830
I don't know how you stand
looking at this stuff.

39:48.002 --> 39:50.971
The dead ones don't really
bother me so much.

39:51.138 --> 39:53.299
Now take a look at this. All right.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.534
It's not a Marie Layton,
but an Ellie Layton.

39:56.977 --> 39:59.309
That's the older daughter
from the photograph.

39:59.480 --> 40:03.211
Yeah. It says she died of an asthma attack
in her apartment.

40:03.384 --> 40:05.409
There's a CPS report attached too.

40:07.188 --> 40:10.180
Child Protective Services.
Was she an abuse victim?

40:10.357 --> 40:14.487
It says her mother was questioned
by a psychiatric nurse at...

40:14.795 --> 40:18.026
...Saint Luke's.
- Your sister.

40:20.935 --> 40:23.460
Wanna give me a hand with those?
Yeah, sure.

40:23.737 --> 40:26.501
Make sure Jesus is centered, all right?

40:26.674 --> 40:29.336
Let's go, people! Let's go!

40:29.510 --> 40:31.876
Hey, Gary, this is a great place.

40:32.046 --> 40:34.606
I have a feeling
it's gonna be a terrific show.

40:34.782 --> 40:38.013
- How's our girl doing, huh?
Not bad.

40:43.023 --> 40:45.048
This is Beth. I'm calling for Taylor.

40:45.226 --> 40:49.390
Taylor, when you get this,
will you call me, please? Thanks.

40:49.563 --> 40:53.294
Jean's papers. I haven't had a chance
to go through them yet...

40:54.401 --> 40:57.700
...but she kept records of everything
in case she had to go to court...

40:57.872 --> 40:59.737
...so it's gotta be in here someplace.

41:08.716 --> 41:12.413
She was the baby.
I was supposed to look out for her.

41:13.053 --> 41:14.077
I'm sorry.

41:22.897 --> 41:23.921
Is this it?

41:30.704 --> 41:31.796
It says Marie Layton...

41:31.972 --> 41:35.169
...checked her daughter Ellie
into the hospital for an asthma attack.

41:35.342 --> 41:38.277
And here's the little one, Laurel,
stuck a needle in her hand.

41:38.445 --> 41:43.178
Laurel, insect bites, a burn on her leg.
Ellie, another asthma attack.

41:44.251 --> 41:46.879
Okay, Laurel again,
pesticide in her eye.

41:47.054 --> 41:49.488
Here's another one.
Laurel ingested detergent.

41:49.657 --> 41:50.749
And there, another burn.

41:51.058 --> 41:53.925
Look at that. That's nine admissions
in April and May alone.

41:54.662 --> 41:57.529
Munchausen syndrome by proxy.

41:57.965 --> 42:00.900
It's when a mother wants attention,
so she hurts her children...

42:01.068 --> 42:02.399
...so they need medical help.

42:02.570 --> 42:04.936
But there's no way
she could've given Ellie asthma.

42:05.105 --> 42:08.006
No, but she could have exposed her
to something to set it off.

42:08.175 --> 42:10.575
So Ellie has an asthma attack and dies.

42:10.744 --> 42:13.269
My sister starts asking questions.

42:13.447 --> 42:16.041
Marie gets nervous
she's gonna be found out...

42:16.217 --> 42:18.048
...so she takes Laurel and disappears.

42:19.119 --> 42:21.053
I'm gonna go get Missing Persons on this.

42:27.127 --> 42:29.857
<i>A cell phone rings
and Death is on the line.</i>

42:30.030 --> 42:33.591
<i>A beautiful coed,
a ticking clock of ghostly murder.</i>

42:33.801 --> 42:36.998
<i>Next, American Miracles takes you there
as a famed exorcist...</i>

42:37.171 --> 42:40.937
<i>...tries to outrace the mysterious curse
that has already claimed two lives.</i>

42:42.543 --> 42:46.946
Spiritual energy exists
in the same electromagnetic spectrum...

42:47.114 --> 42:48.843
...as light or microwaves.

42:50.050 --> 42:53.816
It's no surprise
it can travel through cellular phones.

42:54.521 --> 42:57.490
And it grows there, like a seed...

42:58.025 --> 43:03.622
...where it eventually manifests as
hallucinations, spiritual disturbances...

43:03.797 --> 43:05.492
...and finally death.

43:05.666 --> 43:07.395
For you, darling.

43:07.568 --> 43:10.036
<i>Taylor, it's Beth.
Hey, Beth.</i>

43:10.204 --> 43:12.001
Listen, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

43:12.172 --> 43:14.606
It's okay. Hold on.
We'll be there in a few minutes.

43:14.775 --> 43:17.107
No. It's gonna work out. I know it.

43:17.278 --> 43:20.509
- No, Taylor, listen to me.
- There's nothing else I can do.

43:21.849 --> 43:23.510
- Shit.
Okay, everybody, here we go.

43:23.684 --> 43:27.211
Quiet, please. And four, three, two...

43:28.155 --> 43:30.180
We cast out this unclean spirit.

43:32.893 --> 43:34.952
Depart from here, Satan.

43:35.129 --> 43:37.620
Depart, every demonic power...

43:37.798 --> 43:40.358
...every infernal adversary, every legion.

43:41.068 --> 43:42.399
I command you.

43:42.569 --> 43:44.935
I command you in the name of God...

43:45.105 --> 43:50.065
...in the names of all his heavenly
angels, to be gone from this cell phone.

43:50.444 --> 43:51.638
I command you...

43:51.812 --> 43:56.272
...by the judge of the living and the
dead, you will leave my sister alone.

43:56.517 --> 43:58.712
Come out, I say, in Jesus' name!

43:59.153 --> 44:00.415
You serpent!

44:01.188 --> 44:02.587
Devil!

44:02.956 --> 44:05.151
In the name of Jesus of Nazareth...

44:05.326 --> 44:08.557
<i>...you will haunt this child of God
no more:</i>

44:10.497 --> 44:13.728
Stop tormenting my sister.
You will come out now!

44:22.242 --> 44:24.267
I am calling you by name, Satan.

44:24.611 --> 44:26.135
Come out. Show yourself!

44:31.952 --> 44:35.149
Depart. Depart this place. Depart.

44:35.389 --> 44:37.414
Hey, hey, you guys, take it easy.
I'm a cop.

44:55.609 --> 44:57.042
Keep rolling. Keep rolling.

45:12.493 --> 45:15.428
Taylor? Taylor.

45:16.797 --> 45:18.094
Taylor.

45:39.319 --> 45:42.516
Beth, hey. You okay? Yeah?

45:48.629 --> 45:50.824
Everybody back off.

45:52.433 --> 45:56.494
Did you get that, huh?
Please tell me you got it.

45:56.737 --> 45:57.965
Huh?

45:58.705 --> 45:59.694
Ah...

46:21.829 --> 46:23.626
Tomorrow.

46:24.431 --> 46:26.558
You weren't there, Mickey.
You didn't see this.

46:26.733 --> 46:29.293
- This girl needs protection.
- From what?

46:29.470 --> 46:33.702
The ghost in her cell phone?
Tell her to call customer service.

46:34.074 --> 46:36.065
Jack, Mickey's got a point.

46:36.243 --> 46:38.768
Best use of people here
is we find the doer.

46:39.112 --> 46:40.602
Yeah.

46:40.981 --> 46:43.279
You're doing a great job so far.

47:12.980 --> 47:14.470
<i>Voice call received...</i>

47:14.648 --> 47:19.585
<i>Saturday, June 17th, 7:55 p. m.</i>

47:19.853 --> 47:22.515
<i>Why?</i>

47:22.689 --> 47:25.852
<i>Please, just tell me why.</i>

47:39.339 --> 47:43.537
Look, are you sure you wanna stay here?
Maybe you could stay with family instead?

47:44.444 --> 47:47.106
- Well, my father's dead.
- Well, what about your mother?

47:50.984 --> 47:52.884
She and I don't talk very much.

47:54.788 --> 47:57.586
- You don't have to stay.
- That's not gonna happen, okay?

47:57.758 --> 47:59.487
I'm not going anywhere.

48:15.742 --> 48:18.939
Look, this isn't over yet.

48:19.880 --> 48:21.404
All right?

48:21.715 --> 48:26.846
- There's still time to figure this out.
- Not before 7:55 tonight.

48:33.994 --> 48:36.155
- Jesus. Beth, what happened here?
- Oh!

48:41.068 --> 48:43.468
How old were you
when you got those?

48:43.637 --> 48:45.832
Seven? Eight?

48:48.342 --> 48:50.310
Was it your mother?

48:53.480 --> 48:55.175
Did your father know?

48:59.052 --> 49:02.886
When I call you, I expect you to come.
Do you hear me?

49:05.659 --> 49:06.751
Do...

49:07.561 --> 49:08.585
<i>:::you:::</i>

49:09.062 --> 49:10.120

49:34.521 --> 49:37.854
<i>Cry, baby, cry</i>

49:38.025 --> 49:39.720
You're disgusting.

49:40.427 --> 49:43.396
Go ahead. Go cry to your father.

50:01.481 --> 50:03.278
Daddy?

50:07.954 --> 50:09.854
Daddy?

50:54.367 --> 50:55.732
Hello.

50:56.937 --> 50:58.802
Yeah. Okay.

50:59.740 --> 51:01.139
Where?

51:02.476 --> 51:04.740
All right. All right, thanks.

51:04.978 --> 51:08.573
That was Missing Persons.
They found Laurel. She's in a foster home.

51:11.051 --> 51:13.178
She was at Saint Luke's
when it caught fire.

51:13.353 --> 51:16.015
- Wait. So she was still at the hospital?
- Yes.

51:16.189 --> 51:20.319
She'd cut her arm, and there'd been
a report to Child Protective Services.

51:20.494 --> 51:22.894
They were holding her
until she could be examined.

51:23.063 --> 51:25.258
What about her mother?
Do you know where she is?

51:25.832 --> 51:28.266
She hasn't been seen since the fire.

51:30.203 --> 51:34.037
- Well, do you think we could talk to
Laurel? - You can try.

51:40.714 --> 51:44.480
Laurel? There are some people here
to see you.

51:50.724 --> 51:53.522
Hi, Laurel. My name's Jack.

51:57.264 --> 51:59.425
It's a cute little teddy bear you got there.

52:01.802 --> 52:04.396
Does your teddy bear have a name?

52:04.871 --> 52:07.305
She hasn't spoken since the fire.

52:10.877 --> 52:12.367
Laurel, listen to me.

52:12.546 --> 52:15.014
It's very important
that we find your mother.

52:15.182 --> 52:17.241
Do you know where she is right now?

52:19.820 --> 52:22.482
Laurel, do you know
where your mother went?

52:23.890 --> 52:26.017
Do you know where she is?

52:34.935 --> 52:37.836
Do you think there's maybe
some way that you could talk to her?

52:38.004 --> 52:40.495
L...
You wanna try talking to her?

52:45.879 --> 52:50.077
What's wrong?
It's just the song the bear plays.

52:53.386 --> 52:54.751
Laurel, honey?

52:55.922 --> 52:57.981
Honey, do you know
where your mother is?

52:58.592 --> 52:59.786
Laurel?

52:59.960 --> 53:01.222
Can you tell...? Look at me.

53:01.394 --> 53:04.420
Can you tell us? Do you know?
Can you say something?

53:04.731 --> 53:07.256
Where is your mother? Goddamn it.

53:11.605 --> 53:14.665
Oh, that was great, you know?
You really have a way with kids.

53:14.841 --> 53:18.174
We have four hours left.
We're not gonna find her in time.

53:18.345 --> 53:20.336
Yes, we will.
The first thing we'll do...

53:20.513 --> 53:23.175
...is go downtown
and hit the department computers.

53:23.350 --> 53:25.841
Everybody leaves a trail,
ATM machines, credit cards.

53:26.019 --> 53:27.932
- We'll track Marie that way.
- You do that.

53:28.088 --> 53:31.683
I'll find out about the fire at Saint
Luke's. Everything seems to start there.

53:31.858 --> 53:34.520
Are you out of your mind?
Don't even think about that.

53:34.694 --> 53:38.653
- I'm not letting you out of my sight.
- We'll get more done if we split up, okay?

53:38.832 --> 53:41.357
And I'm safe until 7:55 p. m.

53:41.768 --> 53:43.201
All right.

53:43.603 --> 53:46.163
- I'll meet you at the library at 7 sharp.
- Okay.

53:46.339 --> 53:48.569
Here, take my other phone.

53:49.442 --> 53:51.410
Call me if you need me.

55:07.620 --> 55:10.248
<i>Dr. Nelson, please report to
Cardiology.</i>

55:10.423 --> 55:12.254
<i>Dr. Nelson, please report...</i>

55:12.425 --> 55:15.588
- Can you ask him to hurry, please?
- I've already called him twice.

55:17.297 --> 55:21.165
- Miss Raymond. Mm-hm.
- Dr. Painter? I need your help.

55:22.035 --> 55:24.094
You were the doctor
on the children's ward...

55:24.270 --> 55:26.465
...the day of the fire
at Saint Luke's Hospital?

55:26.639 --> 55:27.663
- That's right.
- Okay.

55:27.841 --> 55:30.776
Do you remember a little girl,
Laurel Layton? She was 6.

55:30.944 --> 55:34.311
She had cut herself and you made her
stay there so the CPS could investigate.

55:37.283 --> 55:38.307
Shit.

55:38.485 --> 55:40.851
Sure, I remember her.
Her sister had just died...

55:41.021 --> 55:43.080
...and one of the nurses
filled out a report.

55:43.256 --> 55:44.848
Right. Do you remember her mother?

55:45.025 --> 55:48.654
Was her mother there when the fire
started? It was during visiting hours?

55:48.828 --> 55:52.195
That wouldn't have made a difference.
The mother was there all the time.

56:09.149 --> 56:11.540
Excuse me. I'm looking for a student,
her name is Beth.

56:11.684 --> 56:13.510
She was supposed to be here
earlier today.

56:14.788 --> 56:15.812
Where are you?

56:16.089 --> 56:19.081
I think Marie Layton was in the hospital
when it burned down.

56:19.259 --> 56:21.056
I think that she might've died there.

56:21.227 --> 56:23.252
Impossible. All the bodies were identified.

56:23.430 --> 56:27.025
I know, but what if they didn't find her?
What if her body's still inside?

56:27.200 --> 56:31.967
<i>She was a sick woman, a child abuser.
What if her body is still inside...</i>

56:32.138 --> 56:34.902
...and her spirit's there,
moving through the phones...

56:35.075 --> 56:36.337
...attacking people?

56:38.378 --> 56:40.972
Okay, all right. Where are you?
I'll come get you.

56:41.881 --> 56:46.477
Well, here we are, miss, Saint Luke's.

56:46.653 --> 56:48.553
<i>What's left of it, anyway.</i>

56:48.692 --> 56:51.256
<i>Beth, no! Wait for me, all right?
I'm on my way.</i>

56:51.257 --> 56:53.452
Hurry, there's not much time.

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:19.914
Shit!

01:01:57.730 --> 01:02:00.631
- It's okay, it's okay.
- She's coming for me. She's coming.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.768
- Okay, come on. Let's go.
- She's coming.

01:02:12.478 --> 01:02:14.969
No! No!

01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:24.152
What the hell is that?

01:02:26.025 --> 01:02:27.390
Come on, let's go!

01:02:31.931 --> 01:02:34.058
- Try those doors right there.
- Uhn!

01:03:09.902 --> 01:03:11.802
Jack!

01:03:11.971 --> 01:03:13.563
Jack!

01:03:37.363 --> 01:03:38.694
No!

01:05:23.536 --> 01:05:25.003
Beth!

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:28.556
Please don't hurt me.

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:33.925
Please.

01:07:37.503 --> 01:07:43.703
Forgive me.

01:07:45.611 --> 01:07:47.374
Why?

01:07:48.748 --> 01:07:49.976
Why?

01:08:23.415 --> 01:08:25.383
She had to be the first.

01:08:25.684 --> 01:08:29.120
She had to have my sister's number
stored in her cell phone.

01:08:29.421 --> 01:08:33.323
I know what she was,
but I have this feeling that she...

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.787
...brought me here or something
to protect me.

01:08:38.863 --> 01:08:41.731
Otherwise, why am I still alive?

01:08:56.482 --> 01:08:58.473
Broken pile ready to go?
Yeah.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.348
Do you wanna come in?

01:09:36.822 --> 01:09:40.484
No, I've gotta go tell Laurel
that her mother's gone.

01:09:40.658 --> 01:09:43.252
Besides, you look like
you could use some rest.

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:44.520
Yeah.

01:09:46.899 --> 01:09:49.890
Maybe you could call me sometime.

01:09:50.402 --> 01:09:51.663
How about tomorrow?

01:09:53.037 --> 01:09:54.767
Tomorrow would be nice.

01:11:12.785 --> 01:11:16.619
It's just as well.
I'll tell her myself in the morning.

01:11:23.862 --> 01:11:26.729
What is it?
- That's Laurel's, isn't it?

01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:30.733
It looks like hers.
Yeah, that's the teddy bear.

01:11:46.485 --> 01:11:48.077
It's a nanny cam.

01:11:48.354 --> 01:11:51.084
Records what goes on in the kid's room.

01:12:02.001 --> 01:12:04.526
<i>We'll come in here...</i>

01:12:05.204 --> 01:12:08.139
<i>...and sit you down.</i>

01:12:08.774 --> 01:12:12.107
Now, be a nice little girl.

01:12:36.502 --> 01:12:37.935
Oh, my God.

01:12:46.211 --> 01:12:49.374
Now, this will only hurt a little.

01:12:51.417 --> 01:12:52.975
Hey, guys...

01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:03.688
Get away from her!

01:13:06.065 --> 01:13:07.794
It was you.

01:13:07.966 --> 01:13:10.366
It was you the whole time.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:16.635
I should've known.

01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:23.104
<i>Mama!</i>

01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:26.042
<i>Please, help me! Mama!</i>

01:13:28.253 --> 01:13:29.481
Mama!

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:43.726
Hi, Laurel. It wasn't
your mother who hurt you.

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:45.505
It was your sister, Ellie, wasn't it?

01:14:52.371 --> 01:14:55.636
But she always gave me candy.

01:14:58.777 --> 01:15:01.974
- More stuff from the hospital?
- Yep. CSU will go through it tomorrow.

01:15:02.147 --> 01:15:04.172
- See you later.
- Yeah. Take it easy, man.

01:16:00.672 --> 01:16:04.904
<i>Voice call received Saturday, June
17th...</i>

01:16:05.077 --> 01:16:07.204
<i>...11 p. m.</i>

01:16:11.216 --> 01:16:12.649
<i>No.</i>

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:14.877
<i>No, wait. Wait, no!</i>

01:16:21.226 --> 01:16:23.922
<i>I... I just thought
you should hear this, Jack.</i>

01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:25.787
<i>Jack?</i>

01:16:44.249 --> 01:16:46.274
Come on. Come on, pick up.

01:16:52.291 --> 01:16:54.919
<i>Hi. No one's home, leave us a
message.</i>

01:16:55.927 --> 01:16:59.556
Beth, listen, okay?
Marie wasn't the first, it w...

01:17:03.802 --> 01:17:05.793
So, look, you were right.

01:17:05.971 --> 01:17:09.099
Marie wasn't trying to kill you
at the hospital. She was trying...

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:10.775
<i>...to protect you, all right?</i>

01:17:10.776 --> 01:17:13.506
<i>She was trying to
keep her daughter away from you.</i>

01:17:16.548 --> 01:17:17.913
Call me.

01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:04.982
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:06.852
Look, it wasn't Marie, all right?

01:19:07.025 --> 01:19:09.808
The whole time it was Ellie.
She made the very first phone call.

01:19:11.797 --> 01:19:13.560
What's that?

01:19:32.684 --> 01:19:34.948
No. No, wait. No!

01:19:37.122 --> 01:19:39.716
No!

01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:15.420
Aah!
