00:01.960 --> 00:03.461
ALLISON: Previously on Eureka.

00:03.504 --> 00:06.621
I need the files
from the explosion
that killed Kim Anderson.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.664
Why?
Beverly is involved.

00:08.717 --> 00:09.752
Carter is
following a road

00:09.843 --> 00:12.004
that goes right through Henry
and leads right to Kevin.

00:12.054 --> 00:14.887
NA THAN: He controls
the ﬁeld, now, Allie.
He '3 evolving.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.430
If they get a hold
of Kevin, he will never
have a normal life.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.349
Well, we have
to get that thing
out of him.

00:19.394 --> 00:23.763
l'm shutting down all
research into the artifact
and the accident. I'm sorry.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.771
LUCAS: Okay, Fifth
Geometric Postulate?

00:28.862 --> 00:30.978
Math is useless,
bordering on futile.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.316
But you have
to pass it.

00:32.366 --> 00:35.108
And how can you
hate something
that's perfect?

00:35.202 --> 00:37.067
There's no wiggle room.
I like things messy.

00:37.162 --> 00:40.154
But chaos theory
states that there's
an underlying perfection

00:40.207 --> 00:41.788
to the randomness
of all things.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.208
Like, ifl did something
completely unexpected.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.040
It would be
totally perfect?

00:51.093 --> 00:52.879
And not
at all futile.
Oh.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.460
Now,
close your eyes.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.553
I've got something
for you.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.437
Lucas, it's so pretty.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.279
Working here!

01:14.116 --> 01:16.448
So, did you
ask your dad?

01:16.535 --> 01:19.777
Well, not yet, but
with his weekend plans,
how could he say no?

01:24.084 --> 01:25.699
Thank you.
You're very welcome.

01:25.752 --> 01:26.741
Thanks, Vince.

01:26.837 --> 01:29.123
So I'm closing up
tomorrow at 5:00.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.205
Hmm. Then we can be
on the road by 6:00.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.920
I found my old waders,
by the way.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.718
We don't have
to actually fish,
you know?

01:37.431 --> 01:41.424
You kidding? How often
is it that | find a girl
who likes to fish?

01:41.852 --> 01:43.183
Anything else
for you guys?

01:43.270 --> 01:45.761
No.
Hey! Hey!
Let me get that.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.264
Hey, ready
for the big trip?

01:48.317 --> 01:50.524
Dad actually
went out and bought
a new pair of waders.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.101
CALLIE: Really?

01:52.362 --> 01:53.397
Thanks.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.108
What are you doing, Zoe?
What do you want?

01:55.198 --> 01:59.612
What... What do I want?
How could you say that?
I'm hurt and offended.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.368
(LAUGHING)
Okay, this sounds like
a private thing.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.992
I will see you later.
All right.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.538
Bye, Zoe.
Bye.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.116
See you later.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.627
Oh, don't worry.
You'll get plenty of time
together this weekend.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.796
(SIGHS)
What happens fly fishing,
stays fly fishing.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.422
Separate rooms.
Yeah, okay.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.503
Uh-huh.

02:15.594 --> 02:18.461
But since you're
gonna be gone,
I thought that maybe

02:18.513 --> 02:21.471
I could have a few
people over, you know,
to keep me company.

02:22.809 --> 02:23.844
Like a party?

02:23.935 --> 02:25.971
Like a slumber party.

02:26.772 --> 02:27.761
Mmm.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.222
Maybe.
How many girls we talking?

02:30.317 --> 02:32.273
Roughly five or six.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.979
And maybe
five or six boys.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.322
Okay, Dad,
we're not kids anymore.

02:39.368 --> 02:41.324
Well, then they're
definitely not gonna
spend the night.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.153
All right, here's the new
"not kid" rule. No boys.

02:44.206 --> 02:45.946
But, Dad...
No buts.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.329
(SIGHS)

02:47.417 --> 02:48.748
No coffee!

02:55.175 --> 02:59.635
Put your finger there.
Put your arm up.
Good to go, kiddo.

03:00.472 --> 03:03.134
Loss of hemoglobin makes
my blood sugar low,
you know.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.844
Well, you know
what else I know?

03:04.935 --> 03:07.847
Cafeteria has
chocolate chip cookies today.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.974
Go ahead.

03:12.859 --> 03:16.147
Icouldn't let him
do that by himself
a month ago.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.403
He communicates
so well now.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.776
Juster
a normal kid.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.488
lt scares me, Nathan.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.695
I'm afraid
of what the change
might be doing to him.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.202
You're thinking
about Carl Carlson.

03:29.251 --> 03:30.411
Aren't you?

03:30.502 --> 03:33.118
He's the only other person
who has had a connection
with the artifact.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.202
Not like Kevin.

03:34.256 --> 03:36.372
If only a fraction of it
killed Carl...

03:36.466 --> 03:37.626
Allie.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.881
I'm working on it.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.298
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to him.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.302
(SIGHS)

03:51.398 --> 03:52.683
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
Hey!

03:52.733 --> 03:55.190
Hey, Jo!
What? Is it a...

03:55.235 --> 03:57.146
What is it?
Free-donut day at Cafe Diem?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.102
No.
Crowd control call.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.563
MAN 1: Come take a look!

04:01.992 --> 04:03.653
WOMAN 1: What?
What are you talking about?

04:03.827 --> 04:05.363
MAN 2: Did you see that?

04:06.705 --> 04:08.115
MAN 2: There's got
to be an explanation...

04:08.206 --> 04:09.491
MAN 3:
That was something, huh?

04:09.583 --> 04:10.572
WOMAN 2: Certainly has.

04:10.667 --> 04:11.998
Excuse me.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.966
Is that...

04:22.053 --> 04:23.179
Gold.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.052
Beats free donuts.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.477
MAN 4: It seems magical.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.512
Now, looks like

05:13.980 --> 05:18.770
pure 24-karat gold.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.814
Wasn't there a fairy tale

05:21.905 --> 05:24.146
about turning metal
into gold?

05:24.616 --> 05:26.481
The ancient science
of alchemy.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.157
The modern term
is transmutation.

05:28.245 --> 05:31.658
People have been
obsessed about this
myth for millennia.

05:31.706 --> 05:34.493
You still okay
to take some samples,
do your thing?

05:35.252 --> 05:38.836
I'll try, but I'm not sure
I have the right equipment
in my garage.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.162
Why don't you use
your lab at G.D.?

05:40.257 --> 05:42.498
I don't have a lab
at G.D. l was locked out.
What?

05:42.592 --> 05:46.676
Someone is denying me access
to Kim's artifact research.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.923
You wouldn't know
anything about that,
would you?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.223
I don't think so.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.299
Uh-huh.

05:55.772 --> 06:00.641
Well, I'll find out
what I can about
Golden Boy.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.186
JO: Anything else
you can remember about
the statue cleaner?

06:04.239 --> 06:07.197
He had an accent
and no respect
for privacy.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.314
Hmm.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.072
Did you see his name?

06:11.538 --> 06:12.618
No.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.365
Oh, oh. Wait, wait, wait.
Yes, on his overalls.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.710
Rudolph.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.375
Are we done yet?

06:19.713 --> 06:20.748
Yeah, we're done.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.501
Okay, your turn.
Your date with Zane.
All-nighter?

06:23.550 --> 06:25.666
That would be
none of your business.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.209
Oh, come on.
l have to live
vicariously through you

06:27.262 --> 06:29.719
since my dad shut me
down this weekend.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.140
Yeah, I heard about that.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.384
I mean, if I wanted
to have sex with Lucas,

06:32.434 --> 06:34.595
I wouldn't have
to wait until my dad
went out of town.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.392
Okay, but you're not.
Right?

06:36.438 --> 06:39.726
(SCOFFS)
Relax. I've seen the
after-school specials.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.769
And, I mean, Lucas is
a perfect gentleman.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.772
Odd? Yes, but
a complete romantic.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.060
Look.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.526
Wow, very medieval.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.368
So, now that we know that
my virtue is still intact,

06:53.413 --> 06:56.155
let's talk about
you compromising yours.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.662
Look at the time.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.202
Got to find Rudolph.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.245
(SIGHS)

07:04.591 --> 07:06.081
ALLISON: So how did
this happen, Carter?

07:06.134 --> 07:07.169
Henry's working on it.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.546
Good.
Yeah.
From his garage.

07:10.639 --> 07:13.551
I got to ask. Did you
shut him out of Kim's lab
because of me?

07:13.600 --> 07:16.137
Well, you said
he wasn't being honest
about the artifact accident.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.387
It's a security issue.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.598
Well, I didn't say
that he broke the law.

07:19.648 --> 07:22.606
I mean, ljust said that
he might know something.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.107
And ljust...

07:26.112 --> 07:28.694
Okay, I'm gonna need
access to Kim's lab,
so when should I stop by?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.522
This is getting serious,
Carter.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.652
If you're doing
an investigation,

07:31.743 --> 07:33.699
you're gonna have to
do everything by the book.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.199
You're gonna need
to make an official request.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.620
Since when?

07:38.375 --> 07:39.865
I'm sorry, Carter.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.372
Yeah. Me, too.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.128
But as long as
we're being official,

07:45.173 --> 07:48.540
I'm gonna need to
see Beverly Barlowe's
classified G.D. file.

07:48.635 --> 07:52.173
Well, you'll need to
make an official request
for that, also.

07:59.312 --> 08:04.227
Allie, I am looking
at Kevin's blood cells from
last week and from yesterday,

08:04.567 --> 08:06.068
and there's
been a mutation.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.892
Almost evolutionary.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.819
Nathan, not almost.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.147
Nathan, he read my mind.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.231
What?

08:13.326 --> 08:17.820
Last night, Kevin knew
exactly what I was thinking
before I even said it.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.997
VVeH,lguess
if his blood cells
are evolving,

08:21.042 --> 08:23.784
his brain cells are, too.
But telepathy?

08:24.254 --> 08:26.620
Carter's not gonna
give up his investigation.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.834
He wants
Beverly's G.D. file.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.170
Give it to him.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.590
He'll need to talk
to Beverly to make a case.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.421
He'll never find her.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.840
How can you be so sure?

08:41.187 --> 08:42.518
Trust me.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.016
CARTER: You notice anything
different about the statue?

08:48.069 --> 08:50.481
What's to change
about the statue?

08:52.198 --> 08:54.029
What were you
using on it?

08:54.075 --> 08:57.283
Same cleaner I use
on that statue every year.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.702
CARTER: We're gonna
need a sample.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.290
lt's expensive.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.417
lt's evidence.

09:06.337 --> 09:09.500
lt's outside.
lwill bring it
from the truck.

09:13.887 --> 09:14.967
Happy guy-

09:15.055 --> 09:17.671
Yep. Probably
wasn't allowed to have
a social life as a child.

09:17.724 --> 09:22.388
Come on, Jo. I can't
let her have a boy-girl
sleepover while I'm gone.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.102
Do you really think
she's gonna do anything?

09:25.190 --> 09:28.523
It's not her
I'm worried about.
It's Hair Boy.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.774
Lucas.

09:31.529 --> 09:35.317
Would you be
less worried if there
were adult supervision?

09:35.950 --> 09:39.568
Well, yeah, but she's
not gonna have a party
if I'm there.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.111
What about me?

09:42.040 --> 09:43.120
You?

09:44.250 --> 09:46.286
Three brothers,
always wanted
a sister.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.835
And, besides,
she'll think you're
a god if you say yes.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.465
And perhaps no one will
tell a certain drycleaner

09:54.552 --> 09:57.635
that you've never
been fly-fishing
a day in your life.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.587
I've been fly-fishing!

10:02.185 --> 10:03.345
Once.

10:04.604 --> 10:08.768
Bring it back. If it
turns anything to gold,
I could use a new truck.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.729
Is there anything else
you can tell us
about the statue?

10:11.778 --> 10:13.143
It's too tall.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.024
Anything strange
about the metal's
composition?

10:15.115 --> 10:19.449
You want to know more?
Go talk to the artist,
Christopher Dactylos.

10:19.536 --> 10:24.701
He will give you a three-hour
lecture on why his hangnail
should be in the Smithsonian.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.333
Can't wait. Thanks.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.888
ALLISON: I thought you
moved all your research
back to G.D.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.136
Nathan, what are
we doing here?

10:44.227 --> 10:46.388
Giving you
some peace of mind.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.733
Transfer papers need
to be signed in order
to complete the delivery.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.154
The package is now
under yourjurisdiction.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.158
The DOD. has
hereby disavowed
all knowledge of it.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.534
Understood.

11:06.291 --> 11:10.125
Nathan, what is going on?
Why are you involved
with the DOD?

11:14.215 --> 11:15.955
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Identity conﬁrmed.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.212
Oh, my God.
Who is that?

11:31.065 --> 11:32.680
Beveny?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.316
There's no place
like home.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.622
ALLISON:
Where did you find her?

11:53.713 --> 11:55.544
Solitary at Guantanamo.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.839
From the looks of her,
it wasn't too pleasant.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.381
Again, Nathan,
why have you been
talking to the DOD?

12:02.430 --> 12:03.636
I bargained
with them.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.054
Gave them evidence
to prosecute Beverly

12:05.099 --> 12:07.715
in exchange for letting
us talk to her first.
What evidence?

12:07.810 --> 12:11.177
A recalibration
device Henry found
on Kim's computer

12:12.065 --> 12:14.226
and video of Beverly
putting it there.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.524
Nathan,
you said we were
in this together.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.400
Why didn't you tell me?

12:18.821 --> 12:20.686
Plausible deniability.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.066
Why do you think
your signature is not
on the transfer form?

12:25.578 --> 12:28.945
Now, I think you should
talk to her first.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.873
NATHAN:
She might trust you more.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.496
Mr. Dactylos?
It's Sheriff Carter.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.130
Hello?

12:45.431 --> 12:46.591
Hello?

12:56.401 --> 12:57.686
(DOOR OPENING)

12:57.777 --> 13:00.359
CHRISTOPHER:
Newton's Third Law of Motion.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.313
"For every action,
there is an equal
and opposite reaction."

13:03.408 --> 13:07.367
You push something here,
and it creates chaos
where you never expected it.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.445
So I presume you're here
about Pythagoras?

13:10.540 --> 13:12.781
Yeah. Yeah,
you sculpted him?

13:12.834 --> 13:14.370
Cast iron mold.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.451
The mold's on display
at the Smithsonian

13:16.504 --> 13:18.460
as an inspiration
to young artists.

13:18.548 --> 13:22.541
Well, I guess it'll be
more famous now that
it's turned into gold.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.459
Any idea how?

13:25.096 --> 13:28.759
Gold would never
be my medium of choice.
It's far too malleable.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.843
Huh.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.760
What do you know
about alchemy?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.769
Some say it was
the first science.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.306
Practiced by
intellectual leaders
throughout history.

13:38.359 --> 13:41.146
In the Middle Ages,
it even incorporated
an occult component,

13:41.195 --> 13:43.356
and many alchemists
were burned at the stake.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.188
What's the crime
in trying to create gold?

13:45.283 --> 13:47.695
The crime of trying
to control nature.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.492
The age-old struggle
between man and God.

13:50.705 --> 13:52.991
Huh. Anything
like that at G.D.?

13:53.041 --> 13:54.997
The last of the
known alchemists
were Eastern European,

13:55.084 --> 13:59.498
but the fall of Hitler and
the rise of particle physics
hastened their demise.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.583
And that should
save you the Google search.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.663
Yeah.

14:02.717 --> 14:05.925
Now if you don't mind,
I've got a piece
in the furnace, so...

14:06.012 --> 14:07.843
Sure. Sure.
Thank you.

14:20.651 --> 14:24.769
Looks like I'm not
the only one surprised
to find me back in Eureka.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.688
Why, Beverly?

14:27.408 --> 14:28.739
Why would you betray
your own government?

14:28.826 --> 14:31.317
What could possibly
be so important?

14:31.537 --> 14:33.368
Oh, come on, Allison.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.743
You haven't had the big office
for that long.

14:37.377 --> 14:41.461
There are obligations
that we have that go
beyond governments.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.538
Things we need
to protect.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.715
The way you protected
Kim Anderson?

14:45.760 --> 14:48.376
Things did not turn out
the way I planned.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.712
I never meant
for her to die.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.843
Well, tell that to Henry.

14:59.941 --> 15:03.354
I need you to tell us
what you know
about the artifact.

15:04.445 --> 15:08.563
And why would I tell you
ifl didn't tell those
nice men at Gitmo?

15:15.915 --> 15:18.748
Look, I never want
to go back there again.

15:24.674 --> 15:28.041
If you help me,
I will help you.

15:29.095 --> 15:32.462
The only way you can help me
is to get me a deal.

15:32.557 --> 15:36.891
And the only way you can do
that is by using your position
to protect me.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.678
But you would never
do that, would you?

15:40.606 --> 15:42.597
Depends on what you know.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.602
So if I tell you
everything,

15:48.364 --> 15:51.902
you will use your
influence with the DOD.
on my behalf?

15:53.703 --> 15:55.443
I'll think about it.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.997
Why, Allison?

16:00.877 --> 16:03.619
Why would you betray
your own government?

16:03.671 --> 16:06.208
What could possibly
be so important?

16:11.471 --> 16:14.304
So the handyman is
from Slovenia?

16:14.390 --> 16:18.508
Used to be Yugoslavia,
part of the medieval
Holy Roman Empire.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.720
History in witchcraft
and ancient practices.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.270
What? Like alchemy?

16:23.316 --> 16:26.399
Rudolph was
born there in 1959,

16:26.486 --> 16:29.023
learned his trade
from his grandfather,

16:29.113 --> 16:33.231
and he owes
the Bank of Eureka
$68,000.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.199

16:36.537 --> 16:38.277
Maybe Rudolph's working
on a way to settle that debt.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.669
And I promise,
no sex, no drugs,
no rock 'n' roll.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.582
You can have
rock 'n' roll.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.337
Oh, and whatever
Jo says, goes.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.417
Yeah, and she's
gonna be armed,

16:53.513 --> 16:56.175
so Lucas stays 3 feet
away from you at all times.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.304
Three feet.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.886
Dad, he's not like that.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.467
He's respectful
and kind and generous.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.477
Mmm.
Sounds like you're
dating the Pope.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.434
Oh, and look
what he gave me.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.356
That looks expensive.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.984

That's telling him, Vince.
All right, what happened?

17:32.176 --> 17:37.045
Okay, first, the utensils
turned to gold, then the
counters, then the silven/vare.

17:37.098 --> 17:40.431
And that's when they
turned against me
like vultures.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.427
Like greedy little
genius vultures.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.561
I thought intelligent men
were above such things.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.779

18:02.915 --> 18:04.325
(CROWD CHATTERING)

18:05.918 --> 18:07.783
Hey. Please tell me
you got a handle on this,

18:07.878 --> 18:10.164
because I got a town
full of petty larcenists.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.917
Everything metal
turned into gold?

18:12.008 --> 18:13.714
No, only certain places.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.171
The kitchen, the counters
and some of the stuff
on the tables.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.048
But nothing
in that half
of the room.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.588
So it's probably not
airborne, or everything
metal would have changed.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.799
You know, 'cause
the substance we
found on the statue

18:22.893 --> 18:24.178
works like bacteria,

18:24.270 --> 18:27.228
converting the molecular
structure of metal
into gold,

18:27.273 --> 18:29.935
so I'd say it's
a contact issue.

18:30.568 --> 18:33.526
One infected metal
touches another,
and then it spreads.

18:33.613 --> 18:37.447
Okay, so if the bacteria
was on the statue, and then
something touches the statue,

18:37.533 --> 18:38.864
and that something
was brought in here...

18:38.951 --> 18:39.940
Exactly.
Okay.

18:39.994 --> 18:42.610
Hey, Vince, I'm gonna
need a list of everybody
who came in here yesterday

18:42.663 --> 18:45.279
and, if you can remember,
if they were wearing
or carrying something

18:45.374 --> 18:47.035
that could've touched
the statue.
Okay.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.457
Thanks.
Uh-oh.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.878
What "uh-0h"?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.247
Zoe's bracelet.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.539
We were sitting
right here when
she showed it to me.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.300
She said Lucas gave it
to her and they were
by the statue.

18:58.387 --> 18:59.797
That would do it.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.634
Yeah, but she's
safe, right? I mean,
people are safe?

19:02.725 --> 19:05.262
It's metal-to-metal only.
She's fine.

19:06.354 --> 19:09.096

a gold epidemic on our hands.

the richest town in the world.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.266
Well, that's one way
to look at it.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.437
Gold is a soft metal,
so it doesn't bear
the same weight as steel,

19:17.490 --> 19:19.776
so our infrastructure
could be collapsing.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.077

kind of parasite
feeding off its host,

19:55.528 --> 20:00.067
mutating into
a metal-eating
bacteria,

20:00.658 --> 20:04.025

24:08.447 --> 24:09.983
Give me time.
I'm sure I'll top it.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.154
I need to know everything
you can remember

24:11.241 --> 24:13.197
about where you got it
and who sold it to you.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.662
I didn't buy it.
I made it for her.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.664
She likes blue.

24:23.003 --> 24:27.087
Eyes front.
So you made it. What,
by yourself? Out of what?

24:27.132 --> 24:28.167
Scrap metal.

24:28.258 --> 24:29.964
He's really talented.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.342
That's an interesting hobby.

24:32.429 --> 24:36.468
It's not a hobby.
It's a class. Metallurgy.
I take it at school.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.264
So the scrap metal
came from Tesla?

24:38.310 --> 24:41.768
No, the advanced class goes
to the professor's studio.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.851
Would that be a Professor
Christopher Dactylos?

24:44.942 --> 24:47.854
One of the greatest artists
of the 21st century.

24:47.945 --> 24:50.152
That's all for right now.
Thanks, Lucas.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.778
So is my boyfriend
un-arrested?

24:51.824 --> 24:53.189
He was never arrested.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.659
(ZOE SCOFFS)

24:55.160 --> 24:56.491
Boyfriend?

24:56.662 --> 24:58.994
Yeah, well,
play your cards right.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.867
CARTER: New piece?

25:08.424 --> 25:10.506
Destined for a museum
in Prague.

25:10.592 --> 25:11.627
Sounds important.

25:11.677 --> 25:14.840
Well, what would be the
point of creating something
if it wasn't important?

25:14.888 --> 25:15.923
Or perfect?

25:16.015 --> 25:19.178
One of your students says
that he used a piece of scrap
metal he found in this studio

25:19.226 --> 25:21.012
to make a bracelet.

25:21.061 --> 25:26.181
He washed it
in hydrochloric acid
and it transmuted.

25:28.527 --> 25:32.645
Sheriff, I cannot be
held responsible
for the mistakes of a novice.

25:32.698 --> 25:35.690
Hydrochloric acid,
you say? Interesting.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.869
I know that alchemists
work in secret,

25:37.953 --> 25:42.117
but I need to know what you
did to that piece of metal
before Lucas washed it.

25:42.207 --> 25:46.325
I need to search
the premises, starting
with that cellar right there.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.285
Well, I presume
you have a warrant.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.540
No.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.500
| just have this.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.796
This is what's happening
to your statue.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.715
That gold is transforming.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.057
Be careful with that,
Shenﬁ.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.980
You could be responsible
for unleashing the
destruction of Eureka.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.308
Somebody already has.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.484
Yeah, it's apparently
my student.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.569
Albeit by accident,
he tampered with the formula

26:14.656 --> 26:15.691
that was historically designed

26:15.741 --> 26:17.026
to destroy
whoever tried to master it

26:17.076 --> 26:19.283
without the proper knowledge.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.621
So it's a trap?

26:21.705 --> 26:23.366
It's called the
Alchemist's Curse.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.952
It's designed
to trigger chaotic mutation.

26:26.668 --> 26:30.126
So, metal to gold,
gold to rust...

26:30.214 --> 26:32.296
And rust
to God knows what.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.418
Now if legend is correct,
it will change again
and again and again

26:36.512 --> 26:39.925
until it eradicates
the civilization
that fooled with it.

26:40.015 --> 26:44.600
Babylon, Atlantis,
the Maya.

26:45.479 --> 26:48.812
They all came close,
and look what
happened to them.

26:48.899 --> 26:51.481
Well, we know
it behaves like
a bacteria.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.433
And we have 99%
of the answers right here.

26:53.487 --> 26:58.231
And it would take a genius
of an unnatural kind to come
up with the last 1%.

26:58.283 --> 27:01.946
I'm afraid the
Alchemist's Curse
has found its next victim.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.160
Us.

27:09.378 --> 27:12.040
Okay, right there.
See that? Yeah.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.257
Perfect.

27:18.178 --> 27:20.043
You're getting good
at this, Kev.

27:20.139 --> 27:23.597
Maybe one day you're
gonna be the head of G.D.,
just like your mom.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.758
It makes her
worry too much.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.510
Well, it's a big job.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.513
She's worried
about me.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.728
You both are.

27:37.322 --> 27:40.906
We just want to know
what's making you change,
that's all.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.984
And you think
she can help?

27:44.663 --> 27:45.948
Do you?

27:47.875 --> 27:50.207
Your mom told me
what you can do.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.830
I think it's pretty cool.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.211
Sometimes.

27:56.091 --> 27:57.797
Can you do it now?

27:58.218 --> 28:00.960
Can you tell me what
Dr. Barlowe's thinking?

28:01.013 --> 28:03.971
What she knows
about what's going on
with you?

28:08.854 --> 28:10.515
Guests usually knock.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.225
Friends don't usually care.

28:13.984 --> 28:16.475
Jack found the metal source,
which could quite possibly

28:16.528 --> 28:19.770
help us come up
with an antidote
for the bacteria problem.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.730
Okay. I need to
get Kevin home first.

28:21.825 --> 28:22.814
I'll take care of him.

28:22.868 --> 28:26.531
Jack needs your biochem skills
right now far more than mine.

28:26.622 --> 28:28.704
I'm sure he'll need us both.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.498
Come on, Kev.
Let's go see your mom.

28:38.842 --> 28:41.299
I think we found
the source of our problem.
Now all we have to do...

28:41.386 --> 28:43.672
ls deliver it into
the hands of the genius
who can abuse it.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.132
Good to see you,
too, Christopher.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.805
You two know
each other.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.382
Yes, we started
at Global together.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.676
We had similar interests.
But very
different approaches.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.094
Nathan thought
the future held
all the answers.

28:52.189 --> 28:53.554
IbeHeved
in learning
from the past.

28:53.607 --> 28:56.815
Well, I'm really into
the present, so let's continue
this reunion downstairs.

28:59.863 --> 29:04.232
Wow, I've read about
these secret workshops

29:04.326 --> 29:07.238
where alchemists are protected
from arrests and even death,

29:07.329 --> 29:11.038
but that was back
in the day before the
enlightenment of science.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.415
Modern science is
not that enlightened.

29:13.460 --> 29:17.749
Magic's for losers
and wizards and has
no place in science.

29:17.839 --> 29:21.627
Well, this is fascinating,
but we have a town
that's about to collapse.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.049
I mean, can we fix this?

29:23.095 --> 29:26.587
CARTER: He says that
if we do something wrong,
the bacteria will mutate,

29:26.640 --> 29:29.803
like a built-in curse.

29:29.893 --> 29:32.009
Or a built-in
security algorithm?

29:32.104 --> 29:34.060
Or that.
Why do I
recognize this?

29:34.106 --> 29:36.472
NATHAN: It's related
to the r-process
of the supernova,

29:36.566 --> 29:40.275
which creates
heavy metals
from lighter ones,

29:40.362 --> 29:43.946
like gold from lesser metals.
But this one's incomplete.

29:43.991 --> 29:48.280
No, no. Lucas added
hydrochloric acid,
if that helps.

29:49.788 --> 29:53.372
Maybe. I might be able
to figure out an antibody
if I work backwards.

29:53.458 --> 29:56.416
CHRISTOPHER:
Ah, the great Nathan Stark,
always coming to the rescue.

29:56.461 --> 30:01.000
Now finally you'll understand
the importance of things
that came before you.

30:01.091 --> 30:03.457
But you know
you're under arrest for
withholding information

30:03.552 --> 30:05.634
and obstruction
of justice?

30:06.346 --> 30:08.803
You're gonna have
to come with me.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.721
Lupo? He's on his way up.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.310
Hey, guys, if we have
what we need, we got to go.

30:12.394 --> 30:14.009
Give us a minute?

30:14.104 --> 30:15.139
Yeah.

30:19.776 --> 30:22.813
You know where I've seen
this before. This is Kim's
research on the artifact.

30:22.904 --> 30:23.984
Leave it, Henry.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.357
Nathan,
I can help you.

30:25.449 --> 30:26.985
CARTER: Guys!
We got to go.

30:27.075 --> 30:29.327
No. You can't.

30:30.287 --> 30:31.493
(SCOFFS)

30:38.003 --> 30:41.166
The Cafe Diem outbreak
infected the buildings
on Main Street,

30:41.256 --> 30:43.497
and then tainted vehicles
spread the mutation
through the town

30:43.592 --> 30:45.799
and forced the closure
of the Da Vinci Bridge.

30:45.844 --> 30:46.924
What about Global?

30:47.012 --> 30:50.300
The building frame is steel,
but it's encased in concrete,
so we should be fine.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.715
(RUMBLING)

30:54.978 --> 30:56.434
Maybe it was
an earthquake?

30:56.980 --> 31:00.438
WOMAN ON PA:
Code orange. Engineering team
to Allison Blake ’5 ofﬁce.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.106
Code orange.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.520
(DOOR OPENING)

31:07.866 --> 31:11.233
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Security breach.
Unauthorized entry.

31:19.002 --> 31:22.335
I knew you'd find a way in
once you knew I was here.

31:23.632 --> 31:26.465
After what I discovered,
you're damn right.

31:27.344 --> 31:30.336
You mean,
after you found
what I left for you?

31:31.306 --> 31:33.547
Oh, come on, Henry,
give me a little credit.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.849
You don't think
I accidentally left
behind the one thing

31:35.894 --> 31:38.385
that could explain
Kim's death, did you?

31:38.438 --> 31:40.224
I knew
you'd find it.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.101
VVhy?

31:42.192 --> 31:46.481
Because you deserve to know,
and because you're the
only man in this town

31:46.571 --> 31:49.153
who can understand why
I had to do what I did.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.606
Understand?

31:52.285 --> 31:56.494
You killed the woman I love,
and there is no reason
in this world

31:57.040 --> 31:58.905
that I shouldn't
do the same to you.

31:58.959 --> 32:00.745
It was an accident.

32:01.837 --> 32:05.045
And you already know
the reason or you wouldn't
still be talking to me.

32:05.090 --> 32:08.173
It is the same reason
that Allison took
Kim's research from you

32:08.260 --> 32:10.342
and gave it
to Nathan Stark.

32:12.764 --> 32:17.178
The artifact is capable
of human interface.
Carl Carlson proved that.

32:17.769 --> 32:21.637
And now it's connected
to someone else,
and you know who it is.

32:24.609 --> 32:25.815
Kevin.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.780
Yes.
He's the receiver now.

32:33.743 --> 32:36.234
He's connected
to the Akashic Field.

32:36.621 --> 32:39.328
All the collective knowledge
of the universe?

32:39.416 --> 32:41.077
It's real, Henry.

32:42.127 --> 32:45.619
And that kind of energy
cannot be contained for long.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.333
It could kill him.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.047
So that's what
Nathan's been working on,

32:57.142 --> 33:02.353
trying to separate Kevin
from the field.

33:02.355 --> 33:03.970
trying to separate Kevin
from the field.

33:07.152 --> 33:10.690
There are some things
we aren't meant to control

33:11.781 --> 33:14.614
because it's in our nature
to abuse power.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.364
We're not ready
for the responsibility.

33:19.664 --> 33:22.155
So what is it
you're asking of me?

33:27.589 --> 33:28.624
WOMAN ON PA:
Section Four, code...

33:28.673 --> 33:31.164
Hey, hey! That creaking
noise, louder to the left
or to the right?

33:31.218 --> 33:32.708
(CREAKING)

33:32.802 --> 33:34.053
Never mind.

33:35.639 --> 33:39.302
ALLISON: Nathan,
are you any closer
to figuring this out?

33:40.227 --> 33:42.092
It all makes sense
until I get to the end
of the equation,

33:42.187 --> 33:45.600
and then ifl make a mistake,
it'll mutate again.

33:46.399 --> 33:47.434
What's going on?
Where's Kevin?

33:47.526 --> 33:50.188
He's fine.
He wanted me
to give you this.

33:50.237 --> 33:53.821
He's been obsessed
with it for hours, like
he's channeling something,

33:53.865 --> 33:56.698
and he's convinced
it's going to help you.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.654
Well, it's the formula.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.407
He finished it.

34:03.083 --> 34:06.667
But he's never seen it.
How...

34:07.003 --> 34:08.459
I don't ask
those questions anymore.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.833
(RUMBLING)

34:28.567 --> 34:30.057
FARGO: Help?

34:30.110 --> 34:31.145
(ALARM BLARING)

34:31.236 --> 34:32.316
Help?

34:35.490 --> 34:37.902
Evacuate all
non-essential personnel
right now,

34:37.993 --> 34:40.735
and give project heads
and emergency crews
one hour.

34:40.829 --> 34:43.115
What happened?
Ceiling collapse
in Section Four.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.992
If the floor goes next,
no one will make it
out of there.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.072
Stark come up
with anything yet?

34:46.167 --> 34:47.703
He's working
on an antibody
for the bacteria.

34:47.752 --> 34:51.415
Allison, look,
now's not the time
to get into it,

34:51.464 --> 34:54.126
but Henry and Stark
are involved.

34:54.217 --> 34:55.502
I heard them talking
about Beverly.

34:55.594 --> 34:59.428
Look, there's a collapse
in Section Four we need
to stay focused on right now.

34:59.472 --> 35:02.088
Fargo was down there.
Please find him.

35:25.707 --> 35:28.198
CARTER: Fargo?
Can you hear me?

35:28.668 --> 35:30.204
Please tell me
it's notjust you.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.832
You're welcome.
How you feeling?
You in pain?

35:32.922 --> 35:35.880
My leg's stuck,
but I don't think
anything's broken.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.375
Okay.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.633
(ALARM CONTINUES BLARING)

35:41.681 --> 35:42.716
ALLISON ON P.A.:
Carter, what’s going on?

35:42.807 --> 35:46.220
I found Fargo,
and what's left
of Section Four.

35:46.311 --> 35:49.144
We're gonna need
a rescue team down here
as soon as we can, okay?

35:49.272 --> 35:50.853
(RUMBLING)

35:52.984 --> 35:55.566
Better send them quick
before the beam
below me corrodes.

35:55.654 --> 35:58.270
Happy thoughts, Fargo.
Happy thoughts.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.530
ALLISON: Carter,
Nathan's got something
to stop the rust,

36:00.617 --> 36:02.858
but it'll take a while
to culture enough
for the whole town.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.817
I'm just gonna need
enough to shore up
the beams under Fargo

36:04.913 --> 36:07.245
before the whole
floor collapses.

36:07.624 --> 36:09.160
That's not
a happy thought.

36:09.209 --> 36:10.494
Hang on.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.501
(CREAKING)

36:13.838 --> 36:17.251
I repaired a beam
in Section Two last year.
Dangerous job.

36:17.342 --> 36:21.130
We can't go from the top.
Any more weight would
compromise it.

36:21.888 --> 36:23.298
So we go in
from the bottom?

36:23.348 --> 36:27.011
There is a crawlspace
big enough for
a person to slide in

36:27.102 --> 36:29.263
and apply
the antibacterial solution,

36:29.354 --> 36:33.643
but the whole thing could
collapse while the repair
is being made.

36:35.068 --> 36:38.151
I wouldn't do it
even if my leg
wasn't broken.

36:41.783 --> 36:43.819
Oh, crap.

36:45.495 --> 36:47.861
CARTER: All right,
I'm underneath the
Section Four collapse now.

36:47.956 --> 36:48.991
Can you hear me,
Fargo?

36:49.040 --> 36:50.701
FARGO: Still here.

36:51.835 --> 36:54.542

up onto the ﬁrst beam now.

36:56.673 --> 36:57.788
(GRUNTS)

36:58.216 --> 37:01.128
CARTER: Yeah. I see.
It's pretty bad already.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.720
Wow, thanks
for the update.

37:02.804 --> 37:05.921
Yeah, how do we know
this stuff isn't gonna
make it worse?

37:07.100 --> 37:08.260
Worse?

37:08.351 --> 37:11.514
My information
comes from a pretty
reliable source.

37:11.563 --> 37:12.552
(RUMBLING)

37:13.273 --> 37:15.229
It's weight-bearing.
Go ahead and spray it.

37:17.527 --> 37:20.234
How much of this
metal-eating bug spray
do I use?

37:20.280 --> 37:22.066
NA THAN: As much as it takes.

37:22.157 --> 37:24.318
If we die, at least
we die together.

37:24.659 --> 37:27.366
Oh. Don't kill me.

37:29.414 --> 37:31.154
ALLISON: Carter!
It's not working!

37:31.249 --> 37:32.238
Give it time.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.073
Easy for you to say.

37:39.966 --> 37:42.048
CARTER:
It's working, Fargo!

37:42.385 --> 37:44.626
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

37:44.721 --> 37:48.430
NA THAN: Well, Fargo,
now you and Carter can
live happily ever after.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.841
You want to know
what my happy thought was?

37:52.645 --> 37:55.102
Some things
are better left unsaid.

38:17.504 --> 38:19.836
(ROCK 'N' ROLL MUSIC PLAYING)

(GIGGLES)

38:23.468 --> 38:27.256
Yeah, well, if there's one
skill that comes naturally
to me, it's party-planning.

38:27.305 --> 38:30.297
I can think of
other things that
come naturally to you.

Sheriff. Sorry your getaway
was cut short.

38:35.355 --> 38:37.971
Yeah, thanks, SARAH.
How's security?

38:38.066 --> 38:40.978
SARAH: No physical damage
to the property.

38:41.027 --> 38:43.313
And other stuff?

38:43.738 --> 38:48.482
SARAH: Slow dancing,
couch sitting and two people
currently in the front closet.

38:56.584 --> 38:59.667
What are you...
You're supposed
to be watching...

39:00.880 --> 39:04.623
Well, I was watching
her, and she was
watching me, so...

39:06.344 --> 39:07.709
Yeah, okay.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

39:12.892 --> 39:14.007
Hey, Henry, what's up?

39:14.060 --> 39:16.472
HENRY:
We still have a problem.
Bring your biohazard suit.

39:17.814 --> 39:21.853
HENRY: This man only died
a week ago, and this is
all that's left.

39:21.943 --> 39:25.435
Bone fragments,
ceramic dental crown

39:25.530 --> 39:29.364
and a plastic stent
implanted in this dead man
three years ago.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.316
I don't think I like
where this is going.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.532
What if the metal-eating
bacteria mutated again
before we caught it all,

39:34.581 --> 39:36.617
right here in the morgue?

39:36.708 --> 39:38.699
It started jumping
to people?

39:38.793 --> 39:40.658
I think it's attacking
the iron in our cells,

39:40.712 --> 39:43.670
and this body
is ground zero
for the next stage.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.876
I hate this day.

39:45.925 --> 39:49.338
Now I'm gonna run some tests,
and, hopefully, it will remain
a contact germ.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.422
But if it goes airborne...

39:50.513 --> 39:51.889
Yeah.
I got to tell Allison.

39:51.931 --> 39:55.594
Well, I already
told her and Stark.
Now I'm sure he's on it.

39:55.685 --> 39:56.720
We'll take care
of the science.

39:56.811 --> 40:01.145
You take care of the town.
People may have to
get out of here real fast.

without me right now?

40:34.432 --> 40:36.423
You need to get
some sleep, too.

40:36.517 --> 40:39.259
Allie, I am looking
at the formula,

40:39.354 --> 40:41.094
and ifl can figure out
a way to shut down

40:41.147 --> 40:45.311
Kevin's progression
the same way I shut down
the rusting bacteria, I...

40:45.443 --> 40:46.774
Allie, I'm close.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.195
I know you'll find a way.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.315
Yeah, well, I’ll come up.
I’ll help you get him
to the car.

doing here? It's late.

41:14.097 --> 41:15.428
How is he?

41:16.474 --> 41:17.930
Kevin is fine.

41:18.476 --> 41:21.309
I know what's happening
to him. Same thing that
happened to Carl.

41:21.354 --> 41:23.390
Same thing
that killed Kim.

to the artifact.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.397
Henry, leave this alone.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.771
Too late.

41:30.530 --> 41:32.521
Why? Because of Kim?

41:34.909 --> 41:36.410
Because of me.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.037
Stark! Hey, any luck
with the second antibody?

41:45.128 --> 41:46.334
For...

41:46.713 --> 41:48.499
For the new mutation?

41:48.548 --> 41:51.381
The flesh-eating bacteria.
You know, the...

41:51.467 --> 41:53.879
Your first antibody
triggered another change...

41:53.970 --> 41:56.302
What? Impossible.
I know that formula
was correct.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.804
And why do you think
there was another mutation?

mutated again. It's lethal
