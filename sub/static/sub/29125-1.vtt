02:02.134 --> 02:03.403
Is that a giggle?

02:05.204 --> 02:08.140
Are you over here?

02:08.606 --> 02:09.708
Mari?

02:10.808 --> 02:12.344
Behind you!

02:13.212 --> 02:14.710
You can't catch me!

02:14.712 --> 02:16.446
Where'd you go?

02:16.448 --> 02:21.650
You're around here somewhere.

03:11.903 --> 03:13.736
You should move on now, girls.

03:13.738 --> 03:14.706
It's getting late.

03:15.339 --> 03:16.442
What happened to them?

03:16.942 --> 03:17.877
Cholera.

03:18.576 --> 03:19.579
The whole family.

03:22.313 --> 03:23.281
Come on, now.

03:23.714 --> 03:24.817
You shouldn't loiter here.

03:28.553 --> 03:29.588
Yes, Doctor.

03:56.848 --> 03:58.914
<i>Bless us, O Lord,
and for these gifts</i>

03:58.916 --> 04:00.686
<i>which we are about to receive.</i>

04:01.587 --> 04:04.287
<i>May we pray
that you welcome our neighbours,</i>

04:04.289 --> 04:05.358
<i>who join you now.</i>

04:07.325 --> 04:09.195
We pray, too, for our dad.

04:09.928 --> 04:11.931
Keep him from harm
in the Crimea.

04:13.397 --> 04:15.333
We ask you for his safe return,

04:15.834 --> 04:19.639
so he may join us and
share in your bounty together.

04:20.272 --> 04:22.541
May the Lord
make us truly thankful.

04:23.509 --> 04:24.476
Amen.

04:25.710 --> 04:26.645
Amen.

04:36.822 --> 04:37.857
This is burnt.

04:39.957 --> 04:40.892
Sorry.

04:42.594 --> 04:43.629
You were late home.

04:44.363 --> 04:46.432
I had to see
to the animals myself.

04:46.998 --> 04:49.301
And now you've ruined
our supper.

04:50.635 --> 04:52.237
I... I didn't mean to.

04:57.709 --> 04:59.478
Go and get some potatoes
from the pantry.

05:33.811 --> 05:37.616
<i>♪ Go to sleep my pretty one ♪</i>

05:38.916 --> 05:42.354
<i>♪ Go to sleep my pretty one ♪</i>

05:43.822 --> 05:47.326

06:25.429 --> 06:27.065
I miss Dad.

06:28.866 --> 06:29.801
Me too.

06:32.738 --> 06:33.738
Sleep now.

08:18.676 --> 08:19.712
Mam.

08:20.478 --> 08:22.046
Mam?

08:24.716 --> 08:26.950
Mam, are you awake?
I think there's someone outside.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.113
Who's out here?

11:13.083 --> 11:14.587
Go and find your sister.

11:15.185 --> 11:16.187
We should be leaving.

11:18.957 --> 11:20.693
Last night I heard something.

11:21.726 --> 11:22.827
What did you hear?

11:24.361 --> 11:27.031
I think there was someone
outside in the fields.

11:28.366 --> 11:30.001
I'm sure there's nothing
to worry about.

11:31.403 --> 11:32.303
Go on.

12:51.216 --> 12:54.687
Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

12:58.789 --> 13:01.123
You'll filthy your clothes.
Put her down.

13:01.125 --> 13:02.060
Sorry, Mam.

13:02.360 --> 13:03.361
Come on.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.495
Gwen.

13:45.135 --> 13:46.335
<i>Let us pray,</i>

13:46.337 --> 13:47.438
<i>thanks to God.</i>

13:48.239 --> 13:49.374
Dear Lord...

13:50.574 --> 13:53.211
we are thankful for the good
things that have come to us.

13:54.044 --> 13:58.449
We may not only till the fields,
for we are busy all year...

13:59.317 --> 14:01.919
whether in the quarries
or the mills.

14:02.587 --> 14:06.191
Our achievements
have been both great and small,

14:06.390 --> 14:08.260
but all are of value...

14:09.092 --> 14:11.229
and we thank you, God, for them.

14:12.462 --> 14:16.502
We thank you for the bounty
you gave us within the hill...

14:17.302 --> 14:20.339
so we could earn our way
in your mercy.

14:22.005 --> 14:25.943
We thank you for the quarries
that deliver us our bread.

14:26.845 --> 14:29.380
And we thank you
for the brave men

14:29.614 --> 14:33.986
who work them in the dark
so we can have light.

14:34.218 --> 14:36.387
The light of Jesus Christ.

14:37.522 --> 14:41.559
The light that protects us
from the dark evil around us,

14:42.125 --> 14:45.628
guards us from the devil
and his diseases.

14:45.630 --> 14:47.099
His temptation...

14:47.999 --> 14:49.134
and his sin.

14:52.002 --> 14:53.271
We pray also...

14:55.206 --> 14:58.177
for our husbands
and sons away at war,

14:58.443 --> 15:01.980
may your love
reach out to them...

15:02.579 --> 15:07.084
and guide them to justice
and a safe return.

15:08.218 --> 15:09.554
Merciful Father,

15:10.922 --> 15:13.325
accept these prayers
for the sake of your Son,

15:14.158 --> 15:16.528
our Saviour, Jesus Christ.

15:17.361 --> 15:19.198
- Amen.
- Amen.

15:49.593 --> 15:50.528
Madam...

15:51.194 --> 15:52.164
may I have a word?

15:52.630 --> 15:53.866
Walk ahead, girls.

15:54.231 --> 15:55.233
I'll catch up.

15:56.266 --> 15:57.201
Go on.

16:01.105 --> 16:03.041
Good to see
you in chapel this morning.

16:03.473 --> 16:04.475
I wanted to speak to you

16:04.943 --> 16:06.111
regarding a
very delicate matter...

19:48.698 --> 19:50.435
<i>That Mr Wynne.</i>

19:51.701 --> 19:53.204
<i>He's from the quarry, isn't he?</i>

19:54.938 --> 19:56.108
Yes.

19:56.774 --> 19:58.376
You would never sell the farm.

20:00.710 --> 20:01.779
This is our home.

20:02.947 --> 20:04.416
And it's your dad's home.

20:45.656 --> 20:46.791
Are your feet cold?

20:47.425 --> 20:48.724
Maybe I could
warm them up a bit.

20:50.629 --> 20:51.561
Should I warm you up?
Should I warm you up?

20:51.563 --> 20:53.465
Should I warm you up?

20:53.930 --> 20:55.863
Over here, there's got to be
a tickle spot somewhere.

20:55.865 --> 20:57.500
Have you got ticklish feet?

20:57.502 --> 21:00.338
Ticklish feet.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

22:41.471 --> 22:42.473
Burn them.

22:43.507 --> 22:44.939
But what about their skin?

22:44.941 --> 22:47.542
Can't...
Can't we at least rescue them?

22:47.544 --> 22:48.580
They're worthless.

22:49.514 --> 22:50.649
Start a fire!

27:48.812 --> 27:50.113
What are you doing here?

27:53.684 --> 27:55.850
Their...
Their sheep were killed too.

27:55.852 --> 27:57.284
Like ours, I wanted to see...

27:57.286 --> 27:58.285
Come away now.

27:58.287 --> 27:59.222
Bu... But, Mam...

28:00.157 --> 28:01.926
No, Gwen. We're leaving.

28:06.330 --> 28:08.099
How dare you come here?

28:09.033 --> 28:10.868
People died here and you... you...

28:11.899 --> 28:12.734
you just wander
straight in without thinking.

28:12.736 --> 28:14.101
I know people died here

28:14.103 --> 28:15.936
and their sheep
were killed like ours.

28:15.938 --> 28:18.139
- I just wanted to see...
- Enough, Gwen. We're leaving.

28:18.141 --> 28:19.611
Dad would listen to me.

28:22.746 --> 28:23.747
You'll go home...

28:24.348 --> 28:26.050
you'll get on
with your duties...

28:26.784 --> 28:28.953
and you will not come back here.

30:00.476 --> 30:01.379
Go in.

30:11.554 --> 30:12.724
Go on, you're dry.

30:16.226 --> 30:17.462
Gwen, come here.

30:19.095 --> 30:20.097
I can dry myself.

30:21.130 --> 30:22.766
- Come here.
- I'm fine.

30:23.033 --> 30:23.935
Gwen.

31:16.520 --> 31:18.321
Mam?

31:18.523 --> 31:20.457
Mam!

31:55.258 --> 31:57.060
Go to bed and let her rest.

33:54.444 --> 33:55.245
Yes?

33:56.313 --> 33:57.678
Do you want me to help you
get ready?

33:57.680 --> 33:58.682
<i>I can manage.</i>

34:00.518 --> 34:02.486
Perhaps we don't have to go
to chapel today?

34:03.019 --> 34:04.988
- You could rest.
- No, we are going.

34:05.354 --> 34:07.557
- But, Mam...
- Go and get ready.

34:08.358 --> 34:09.525
Do as I say.

34:10.025 --> 34:12.126
- Wouldn't you better to rest?
- We are going.

34:12.128 --> 34:13.594
To wait?
But Mam, you really should...

34:13.597 --> 34:15.166
Will you just do as I say?

35:40.150 --> 35:41.684
Help! Somebody help!

35:59.635 --> 36:00.603
Careful.

36:02.271 --> 36:03.173
There.

36:03.840 --> 36:05.242
There. Good.

36:07.144 --> 36:08.212
You need to leave.

36:08.711 --> 36:10.180
This way. Come on.

36:44.914 --> 36:47.485
I recommend
she takes a tonic wine.

36:48.718 --> 36:50.121
Three bottles will do.

36:50.553 --> 36:52.590
It will help her
gain her strength back.

36:53.490 --> 36:54.558
How much is it?

36:55.358 --> 36:56.593
Three and six per bottle.

36:57.360 --> 36:58.428
We don't have that.

36:59.695 --> 37:03.633
I want to help you, Gwen, but I
have the quarry to answer to.

37:03.934 --> 37:06.669
After market in a few days,
we can pay you back then.

37:08.572 --> 37:11.709
I can give you
one bottle for now.

37:12.209 --> 37:14.311
Come and see me after market
for the rest.

37:14.977 --> 37:17.347
But I'm afraid
you must pay me back.

37:17.680 --> 37:18.448
Thank you.

37:19.582 --> 37:20.818
If you have
any further problems,

37:21.218 --> 37:22.486
you know where to find me.

37:25.387 --> 37:26.322
Gwen.

41:35.805 --> 41:37.137
- Mam?
- Get out!

41:37.139 --> 41:38.541
- I ju...
- Get out!

42:54.816 --> 42:56.186
Mam, let me go instead.

42:56.718 --> 42:58.852
You are to stay here
and look after your sister.

42:58.854 --> 43:00.923
You're only going to
make yourself worse.

43:01.925 --> 43:03.961
You should be resting
like the doctor said.

43:04.827 --> 43:06.095
We need a good market, Gwen.

43:06.930 --> 43:09.032
We've no sheep to trade,
no fleeces, nothing.

43:09.965 --> 43:12.168
Please, Mam... rest.

43:20.677 --> 43:22.178
Be back before it's dark.

44:40.122 --> 44:41.858
Come and get
your fresh vegetables.

44:42.224 --> 44:43.893
Any veg for you today?

44:48.798 --> 44:49.967
Any veg, madam?

44:53.269 --> 44:55.005
Sir, any vegetables?

44:57.773 --> 44:58.775
<i>Bore da.</i>

44:59.374 --> 45:00.610
<i>Bore da.</i>

45:02.912 --> 45:03.947
It's been a while.

45:04.947 --> 45:05.849
Sorry.

45:09.052 --> 45:10.787
- Good trade?
- Sold plenty.

45:17.193 --> 45:19.229
May I buy some carrots?

45:19.428 --> 45:22.698
- Of course. How many?
- A dozen will do us, please.

45:24.834 --> 45:25.869
Harri.

45:26.968 --> 45:28.371
Um, I should go.

45:47.322 --> 45:49.125
Come and get
your fresh vegetables.

45:49.992 --> 45:51.762
Any for you today, ma'am?

45:53.128 --> 45:54.331
Any vegetables?

45:57.332 --> 45:58.300
You, sir?

46:47.282 --> 46:48.284
Next.

47:03.298 --> 47:05.168
- Name?
- Gwen.

47:07.068 --> 47:10.239
I don't have an appointment.
I came about the extra tonic.

47:12.108 --> 47:13.176
Close the door.

47:19.081 --> 47:20.383
Has your mother improved?

47:21.983 --> 47:23.452
A little, but she hasn't...

47:24.986 --> 47:26.021
Hasn't what?

47:27.389 --> 47:29.092
She still hasn't been herself.

47:29.925 --> 47:30.826
Go on.

47:32.829 --> 47:34.464
I saw her cutting her...

47:36.164 --> 47:38.434
Her arm, into a pan,

47:39.235 --> 47:41.070
just letting the blood run down.

47:43.472 --> 47:45.075
Do you know what she was doing?

47:48.144 --> 47:51.214
Some people believe that sin
can be relieved through skin.

47:52.180 --> 47:55.485
As the blood passes
from the body, so does the evil.

48:08.331 --> 48:09.900
Did she finish the tonic wine?

48:11.267 --> 48:13.970
Yes, that's why I came.

48:20.075 --> 48:21.211
Do you have the money?

48:29.985 --> 48:30.953
I'm sure it's not easy...

48:32.421 --> 48:33.524
just the three of you.

48:35.224 --> 48:38.928
But has your mother ever
considered selling the farm?

48:40.095 --> 48:41.164
We can't sell.

48:42.298 --> 48:44.868
We need it to be good and ready
for when Dad comes back.

48:45.668 --> 48:48.305
I only say so
for your mother's health.

48:49.137 --> 48:51.574
- You could start again.
- Where?

48:52.340 --> 48:55.211
Down the quarries?
In the factories?

48:56.579 --> 48:57.948
Our sheep were killed.

48:59.182 --> 49:02.548
We woke to find them torn apart,
spread across the hillside.

49:02.550 --> 49:03.485
I heard.

49:04.052 --> 49:05.487
The same as the Glangors' flock.

49:08.224 --> 49:11.126
You were there,
when they found the bodies.

49:15.097 --> 49:16.867
Unfortunately, I was too late.

49:17.365 --> 49:19.134
There was nothing
I could do for them.

49:27.376 --> 49:28.378
What if...

49:29.544 --> 49:33.115
What if the quarry wanted
their land and they refused?

49:34.950 --> 49:37.651
Mam, I've seen the men from
the quarry talking to her.

49:37.653 --> 49:42.626
Gwen, I assure you
there is nothing to it.

49:44.526 --> 49:46.630
I just want my mam
to be well again.

49:49.264 --> 49:51.200
I don't want to lose my home.

49:54.403 --> 49:56.006
If she could just rest...

49:57.372 --> 49:59.041
and take the tonic.

50:01.309 --> 50:02.211
Please.

51:41.776 --> 51:44.046
There's nothing
we can do.

51:44.513 --> 51:45.715
He can't walk.

51:47.082 --> 51:48.518
And we won't be able to heal it.

51:49.518 --> 51:51.153
At least we'll have some meat.

51:57.726 --> 51:58.727
I'm sorry.

52:00.128 --> 52:01.130
I'm so sorry.

52:07.202 --> 52:09.104
I'm so sorry.

52:25.688 --> 52:26.689
Come here.

52:32.427 --> 52:33.429
He's in pain.

52:34.762 --> 52:36.131
This is the kindest way.

52:41.169 --> 52:42.604
This is your responsibility.

52:50.211 --> 52:52.381
I could at least say
a prayer for him.

52:54.483 --> 52:58.153
Good boy. Shh. Good boy.

53:57.513 --> 53:58.515
Wait here.

54:01.784 --> 54:03.716
May we have a word
with you and your daughter?

54:03.718 --> 54:05.522
No.
What are you doing here?

54:06.454 --> 54:07.689
We'd rather talk inside.

54:15.798 --> 54:17.430
- Wait here.
- I want to come with you.

54:17.432 --> 54:18.668
You are to stay outside.

54:51.566 --> 54:53.369
We have been alerted to the fact

54:53.702 --> 54:56.305
one of your daughters
visited Dr Wren.

54:57.472 --> 55:01.374
We understand that your daughter
stole medication,

55:01.376 --> 55:04.443
medication that
was quarry's property.

55:04.445 --> 55:06.982
Now, this is something we take
very seriously.

55:08.784 --> 55:10.751
We feel it's a matter
that is highlighting

55:10.753 --> 55:12.588
a bigger issue in your home.

55:13.822 --> 55:16.226
An issue we feel
we are able to solve.

55:16.758 --> 55:18.260
Get out of my house.

55:19.294 --> 55:20.997
Madam, listen.

55:22.597 --> 55:24.467
I suggest you consider
our offer.

55:25.566 --> 55:26.936
For you and your daughters.

55:28.070 --> 55:29.972
This is our home.

55:31.706 --> 55:32.674
Get out.

55:33.608 --> 55:34.610
Get out!

55:59.034 --> 55:59.936
Mam.

56:04.006 --> 56:07.744
- Did you steal the tonic wine?
- No, the doctor gave it to me.

56:09.711 --> 56:10.679
Tell me the truth.

56:11.814 --> 56:13.613
Mam, please, I didn't.
I didn't mean for them to come.

56:13.615 --> 56:14.349
It's the quarry!

56:14.849 --> 56:17.850
Stop this!
You stupid, stupid girl!

56:17.852 --> 56:21.423
I'm sor... Mam, please.
Let go. You're hurting me.

56:21.856 --> 56:26.461
Mam. Mam, please. Stop.

56:26.829 --> 56:31.968
Stop. Mam. Mam.
What are you doing? Mam. Mam.

56:32.901 --> 56:34.070
Strip the carcass.

56:34.702 --> 56:36.038
No.

56:36.604 --> 56:38.974
It will feed us for a month.
Do it now.

56:40.142 --> 56:42.513
- Now!
- I can't.

56:43.845 --> 56:44.947
I can't.

56:50.952 --> 56:52.021
Oh, stop it!

56:53.756 --> 56:54.924
Stop it, Mam!

59:06.755 --> 59:07.990
Night time, Mari.

01:02:37.432 --> 01:02:38.434
Mam?

01:04:06.287 --> 01:04:09.224
I remember when there was
three families in this valley.

01:04:10.492 --> 01:04:13.963
The Griffiths,
and the Rowlands to the South.

01:04:15.497 --> 01:04:17.099
All good friends.

01:04:19.502 --> 01:04:20.401
And now...

01:04:21.403 --> 01:04:22.872
there's only one farm left.

01:04:25.407 --> 01:04:29.144
Steal a sheep
and they'll take your hand.

01:04:31.111 --> 01:04:34.849
Steal a mountain
and they'll make you a lord.

01:05:20.294 --> 01:05:21.430
In there...

01:05:23.131 --> 01:05:24.366
you'll find a letter.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.035
It'll be in a box.

01:05:47.956 --> 01:05:50.291
It arrived
just after your dad left.

01:05:57.365 --> 01:05:58.501
Read it.

01:06:00.168 --> 01:06:01.269
I don't want to.

01:06:02.637 --> 01:06:04.939
I should have told you
from the beginning.

01:06:16.383 --> 01:06:18.086
He's not coming home, Gwen.

01:06:19.086 --> 01:06:22.321
But I promise you,
I will always protect you.

01:06:22.323 --> 01:06:23.959
You and your sister.

01:06:24.425 --> 01:06:26.027
We can be happy,
the three of us.

01:06:26.394 --> 01:06:27.496
You lied!

01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:29.899
All this time.

01:06:30.365 --> 01:06:32.532
You let me believe
he was coming back.

01:06:32.534 --> 01:06:36.372
- You let Mari believe...
- I... I did it to protect you.

01:11:46.546 --> 01:11:47.516
Mam?

01:11:51.585 --> 01:11:52.588
Mam?

01:11:59.661 --> 01:12:01.730
Mam? Mam?

01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:06.367
Stop it! Let go of her.

01:12:06.634 --> 01:12:07.766
- Let go...
- Back!

01:12:09.469 --> 01:12:13.808
Mam! Please. No, stop. Stop it!

01:12:14.808 --> 01:12:18.846
Stop, no! No! No! No!

01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:24.652
Mam!

01:13:06.827 --> 01:13:10.432
Get off! Get off!

01:13:56.777 --> 01:13:57.644
Mam?

01:13:57.646 --> 01:13:59.444
You'll be all right.

01:13:59.446 --> 01:14:01.482
You'll be all right.

01:14:01.848 --> 01:14:02.983
You'll be all right.

01:14:06.153 --> 01:14:08.656
- You'll be...
- Shh. Shh.

01:14:20.434 --> 01:14:22.803
Shh.

01:14:31.711 --> 01:14:33.447
I never meant to hurt you.

01:14:34.881 --> 01:14:37.119
I only ever wanted
to protect you.

01:14:45.226 --> 01:14:46.695
Shh.

01:14:55.603 --> 01:14:56.772
Get Mari.

01:15:37.044 --> 01:15:39.448
Good girl. Look at me.

01:15:39.813 --> 01:15:40.981
Look at me.

01:15:42.082 --> 01:15:43.485
You're all right.

01:15:55.196 --> 01:15:58.133
<i>♪ Go to sleep my pretty ones ♪</i>

01:16:01.736 --> 01:16:04.906
<i>♪ Go to sleep my pretty ones ♪</i>

01:18:22.375 --> 01:18:23.744
Torch the house!

01:18:26.046 --> 01:18:28.282
Burn it down!

01:19:02.183 --> 01:19:04.886
Where are we going?

01:19:09.490 --> 01:19:10.858
To find Dad.

01:19:56.836 --> 01:20:01.836
