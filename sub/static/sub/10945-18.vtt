WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:01.491
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:01.534 --> 00:03.201
I can't seem to make ends meet!

00:03.235 --> 00:05.036
So when Caleb told me
about this prize money,

00:05.304 --> 00:06.704
<i>I knew I had to try.</i>

00:06.772 --> 00:08.273
I just can't believe you didn't
talk to me about it first.

00:08.307 --> 00:09.274
This is my money!

00:09.308 --> 00:10.675
It's our future!

00:10.742 --> 00:13.278
Lou, can I have a friend over
after school tomorrow?

00:13.312 --> 00:14.479
Yeah, sure, what's her name?

00:14.513 --> 00:15.813
His name is Stephen.

00:15.847 --> 00:18.550
Amy, would you consider
coming back to Hillhurst?

00:18.617 --> 00:20.251
Only this time
as my head trainer?

00:20.319 --> 00:22.187
- Are you serious?
- Very.

00:22.221 --> 00:23.455
I've been around
long enough to know

00:23.522 --> 00:24.922
that when Ahmed looks at you,

00:24.990 --> 00:27.559
it's with more
than professional admiration.

00:27.593 --> 00:28.726
Lou, that's crazy!

00:28.760 --> 00:31.062
I've been thinking a lot
about Charger,

00:31.096 --> 00:32.662
and I'd like to take
a look at him,

00:32.698 --> 00:35.032
see if there's anything
that I can do to help.

00:35.067 --> 00:36.266
Okay, well, what about us?

00:36.301 --> 00:37.635
One thing at a time.

00:43.709 --> 00:46.143
<i>Amy, wait! Listen to me!</i>

00:46.177 --> 00:49.513
Now, Ty goes and makes the most
ridiculous gamble in the world

00:49.547 --> 00:51.547
and you're gonna waste
your valuable time

00:51.582 --> 00:53.817
trying to help out him
and his stupid partner

00:53.851 --> 00:54.818
over a lost cause?!

00:54.852 --> 00:55.952
I've gotta do something.

00:55.987 --> 00:57.887
I can't just let Ty
throw his money away!

00:57.922 --> 00:59.555
But you've got
a perfectly good job, honey.

00:59.590 --> 01:01.891
Are you willing to--
Go, answer it.

01:01.926 --> 01:03.159
Ahmed, hey.

01:03.193 --> 01:05.194
Yes, um... I'm gonna be
a little bit late,

01:05.229 --> 01:07.163
but I will be there.

01:07.197 --> 01:08.697
There's just something
that I have to take care of.

01:08.732 --> 01:10.666
I'm really sorry.

01:10.734 --> 01:12.968
Okay. Absolutely.
Bye.

01:13.003 --> 01:14.603
There it is right there.
The prince.

01:14.638 --> 01:15.704
He's gonna lose patience
with you

01:15.772 --> 01:17.172
and then the cheques
are gonna stop.

01:17.206 --> 01:19.374
Dad, I can do my job
and help Ty, okay?

01:19.408 --> 01:20.643
Besides, it's really
not your business

01:20.677 --> 01:21.644
what's my business!

01:22.679 --> 01:25.881
I'm just trying...
Answer it.

01:25.915 --> 01:26.982
Ty, hey.

01:27.017 --> 01:29.383
Yeah, no, I'm-
I'm on my way, okay.

01:29.451 --> 01:30.985
I'll be there.
Bye!

01:33.856 --> 01:37.391
So Caleb...
Still trying to find a rider?

01:37.425 --> 01:39.560
I don't think there's
a barrel racer in Alberta

01:39.594 --> 01:41.595
you haven't texted.

01:41.630 --> 01:44.632
Face it,
that guy doesn't have it in him.

01:44.700 --> 01:47.101
He's all speed and no reward.

01:47.169 --> 01:49.236
But, hey, good luck with that.

01:54.276 --> 01:56.843
She drives me crazy.

01:56.878 --> 01:57.844
Well, I guess the word's out

01:57.879 --> 01:59.946
Charger's a non-starter.

02:00.014 --> 02:01.915
So what if he's an underdog?

02:01.983 --> 02:04.385
There's a reason people love
underdog stories so much.

02:04.452 --> 02:06.620
They always have happy endings.

02:06.688 --> 02:08.420
Caleb, how are we gonna
make this work?

02:08.455 --> 02:12.258
Just relax.
It's not over 'til it's over.

02:12.326 --> 02:13.693
Where's Amy?

02:14.795 --> 02:17.029
Jack, look at this
trick saddle!

02:19.166 --> 02:20.633
This is the one I want!

02:20.701 --> 02:21.634
Isn't it cool?

02:21.702 --> 02:23.336
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

02:23.370 --> 02:24.837
<i>Now I just have to figure
out how I'm gonna pay for it.</i>

02:24.905 --> 02:26.306
Well...

02:26.373 --> 02:29.374
What's the deal with you?

02:29.442 --> 02:31.543
Are you wearing perfume?!

02:31.611 --> 02:33.978
Okay, the deal is,
I have a lunch date.

02:34.013 --> 02:35.280
Lisa is coming over.

02:39.485 --> 02:41.386
Hello?

02:41.454 --> 02:44.423
Yes, she is.
Just hold on.

02:44.490 --> 02:45.824
Stephen.

02:47.259 --> 02:48.492
Hi!

02:49.762 --> 02:50.962
Yeah, I can meet you.

02:50.996 --> 02:54.498
I have to wait until Lou
and my dad get home.

02:55.601 --> 02:58.203
Actually,
they're here right now.

02:58.270 --> 02:59.938
Can I call you back?

03:00.005 --> 03:00.972
Okay. Bye.

03:02.074 --> 03:03.141
Um...

03:03.209 --> 03:04.876
Stephen wants to meet me
at Maggie's.

03:04.944 --> 03:07.277
Can someone give me a ride?

03:07.345 --> 03:08.278
Honey?

03:08.346 --> 03:10.080
Yeah, sure.
Let's go.

03:10.115 --> 03:11.081
I'm here.

03:11.116 --> 03:12.249
And the only reason I am

03:12.283 --> 03:13.316
is because I can't stand
the thought of Ty

03:13.351 --> 03:14.351
losing all
his hard-earned money,

03:14.385 --> 03:15.352
thanks to you!

03:15.386 --> 03:16.754
I know, I know.

03:16.788 --> 03:18.321
But he's a great horse,
you'll see!

03:18.356 --> 03:19.322
And all we have to do
is get a handle

03:19.390 --> 03:20.758
on his one little problem.

03:20.792 --> 03:22.559
I promise we won't take much
of your time at all.

03:22.627 --> 03:23.593
Okay, good,

03:23.661 --> 03:24.628
because Ahmed's already
called me

03:24.662 --> 03:26.662
a few times this morning,
wondering where I am!

03:26.696 --> 03:28.164
Aww! Poor little
needy prince!

03:28.198 --> 03:30.699
Caleb,
let's just get this done!

03:32.000 --> 03:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:45.782 --> 03:47.849
Wow!
This horse is great!

03:47.884 --> 03:50.085
You guys don't need me,
he's fine!

03:50.119 --> 03:51.520
Well, hold on.

03:51.554 --> 03:52.821
Ride him as fast as you can

03:52.855 --> 03:55.424
and start him in the alley.

03:55.458 --> 03:56.825
Okay...

04:00.930 --> 04:03.332
Whoa! Steady!
Hey! Steady...

04:10.940 --> 04:14.509
<i>Whoa! Whoa!</i>
<i>Come on, you missed it!</i>

04:14.543 --> 04:16.611
<i>Whoa! Whoa!</i>

04:17.846 --> 04:19.848
Now do you see the problem?

04:19.916 --> 04:22.650
Yeah.

04:39.835 --> 04:42.102
♪ And at the break of day

04:42.137 --> 04:46.974
♪ you sank into your dream,

04:47.042 --> 04:48.209
♪ you dreamer.

04:48.276 --> 04:50.911

05:04.625 --> 05:06.025
So you see
what we're up against.

05:06.060 --> 05:07.594
I mean our horse
is incredibly fast.

05:07.662 --> 05:08.822
But unless you can figure out

05:08.830 --> 05:10.912
how to get him around that first
barrel, he's not gonna win anything,

05:10.931 --> 05:12.499
much less a high stakes
futurity race.

05:12.567 --> 05:14.801
Okay, well, do you want
to give it another try?

05:14.869 --> 05:16.370
- Yeah! Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:16.404 --> 05:18.204
Oh, hold on.

05:18.272 --> 05:20.206
Ahmed, hey.

05:20.274 --> 05:21.341
Um...

05:21.409 --> 05:23.809
Yeah, I'll be there
within the hour--

05:23.877 --> 05:25.911
Uh, hello?

05:27.381 --> 05:29.248
Um...

05:29.315 --> 05:31.784
I think he hung up on me.

05:31.852 --> 05:33.819
Look, guys, I gotta go.

05:33.854 --> 05:35.588
I'm sorry,
I said I would help you,

05:35.655 --> 05:39.124
but I can't risk
losing my real job.

05:40.594 --> 05:42.294
Amy, wait.

05:45.330 --> 05:48.466
Are you still ticked off
with me?

05:49.435 --> 05:51.135
Well, are you?

05:52.237 --> 05:54.372
Yeah, I guess I am.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.974
Look, we have a deal, okay?

05:58.076 --> 05:59.711
I will help you
figure out that horse.

05:59.779 --> 06:01.045
But...

06:01.079 --> 06:02.145
I can't help thinking

06:02.179 --> 06:03.480
that this is what
it's gonna be like

06:03.515 --> 06:04.681
when we're married.

06:04.749 --> 06:06.450
You not telling me
about big decisions

06:06.484 --> 06:09.352
until you've already made them?

06:09.421 --> 06:10.888
I'm sorry,
that's just how I feel.

06:10.922 --> 06:14.991
You made a pretty big decision
without telling me.

06:16.193 --> 06:17.594
I gotta go.

06:23.066 --> 06:24.199
So that was weird.

06:24.234 --> 06:27.002
- Hmm?   - Dropping Georgie off
to meet a boy.

06:27.037 --> 06:31.441
Yeah. Sign of things to come
I guess, huh?

06:31.475 --> 06:33.910
What's wrong?

06:33.944 --> 06:35.711
Um...

06:35.746 --> 06:38.881
It's nothing,
it's just Georgie and...

06:38.916 --> 06:42.351
I'm trying not to worry,
but I can't help it.

06:42.385 --> 06:43.419
No, why?

06:43.453 --> 06:45.854
Because she's met a boy
at Maggie's?

06:45.888 --> 06:47.622
No!

06:49.359 --> 06:51.394
- Is that the trick saddle
she wants to buy?  - Yeah.

06:51.428 --> 06:53.028
Because you know we can't
talk her out of trick riding now.

06:53.063 --> 06:54.463
I mean that ship has sailed.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.298
It's not the saddle,
or the boy,

06:56.333 --> 06:58.667
it's...

06:58.701 --> 06:59.935
You heard her on the phone.

06:59.969 --> 07:02.270
She said to Stephen,
and I quote,

07:02.304 --> 07:06.240
she had to wait for Lou
and her dad to get home!

07:06.275 --> 07:08.142
I'm sorry, I didn't-
what's the point?

07:08.177 --> 07:11.479
Peter, don't you see? She
has never called me "mom."

07:11.513 --> 07:12.813
Never! Not once!

07:12.848 --> 07:14.382
Oh! Okay...

07:14.416 --> 07:16.017
Well, I don't think that's
anything to worry about, honey.

07:16.051 --> 07:18.386
Yes, it is,
and it's starting to hurt.

07:18.420 --> 07:20.121
Well, then you're being
overly sensitive about it.

07:20.155 --> 07:22.490
Okay, how did she introduce you
to her friends

07:22.524 --> 07:24.592
at the father/daughter dance?

07:27.362 --> 07:28.528
As her father,

07:28.562 --> 07:29.363
but she calls me Peter
all the time, Lou -

07:29.397 --> 07:30.497
all the time -

07:30.531 --> 07:31.865
and I don't get upset about it,
it's-

07:31.932 --> 07:33.300
<i>You know, I think
it's just because...</i>

07:33.368 --> 07:36.403
She has not fully accepted
the fact that I'm her mother.

07:36.437 --> 07:37.737
And who can blame her?

07:37.805 --> 07:40.107
I'm away for weeks on end
on that stupid book tour-

07:40.174 --> 07:41.341
Just stop.

07:41.409 --> 07:42.542
Even when I'm home
I'm working at Maggie's,

07:42.610 --> 07:43.543
or the dude ranch,
and-

07:43.611 --> 07:45.212
Listen to me, stop.

07:45.246 --> 07:46.546
You're overthinking it, okay?

07:46.614 --> 07:48.280
Which is crazy,
'cause it's not like you

07:48.348 --> 07:50.016
to overthink anything ever.

07:50.083 --> 07:51.417
Right, yeah.
This coming from the guy

07:51.485 --> 07:54.153
that she calls "father,"
and "dad."

07:54.221 --> 07:56.990
It's clear that
she has bonded with you

07:57.024 --> 07:58.525
more than she has with me.

07:58.559 --> 07:59.826
That's...

08:04.932 --> 08:08.100
<i>Turkey and Swiss,
or turkey and Swiss?</i>

08:08.135 --> 08:09.135
Turkey and Swiss.

08:09.202 --> 08:10.435
A-ha!

08:10.503 --> 08:12.538
You do remember
our first picnic.

08:12.572 --> 08:14.039
Actually, you could call
that our first date,

08:14.073 --> 08:15.440
couldn't ya?

08:15.508 --> 08:17.676
Remember, you agreed to come
and see those horses with me?

08:17.744 --> 08:19.545
Yes, I do remember.

08:19.612 --> 08:22.548
I also remember that...

08:22.615 --> 08:24.917
We never did make it
to that sale.

08:24.984 --> 08:26.018
No, we didn't.

08:26.052 --> 08:27.986
Boy, that seems like
a long time ago.

08:28.054 --> 08:31.856
Well, that's because
it was a long time ago.

08:31.924 --> 08:34.191
And we're still enjoying
our time together, aren't we?

08:34.259 --> 08:36.360
Yeah, and our time apart.

08:36.394 --> 08:37.394
To you and me.

08:37.462 --> 08:38.495
Mmm!

08:42.768 --> 08:44.168
You know what?

08:44.235 --> 08:45.937
I bet that's
what makes us work.

08:45.971 --> 08:47.237
<i>What's that?</i>

08:47.272 --> 08:49.105
Well, I bet if we spent
all our time together,

08:49.173 --> 08:50.674
we'd kill each other!

08:50.708 --> 08:52.542
I would bet the opposite.

08:52.609 --> 08:54.510
Oh, you would, would you?

08:54.578 --> 08:55.744
All right,

08:55.812 --> 08:57.780
let's put that bet to a test:

08:57.814 --> 08:59.014
How about tomorrow

08:59.049 --> 09:00.783
you come and spend a few days
at my house?

09:00.817 --> 09:02.017
- Your place?
- Mmhmm.

09:02.052 --> 09:04.187
See who wins this bet.

09:04.221 --> 09:06.021
If we survive, that is.

09:06.090 --> 09:07.022
You're on!

09:07.091 --> 09:08.524
Yeah?

09:08.592 --> 09:09.825
Ahmed, I am so sorry.

09:09.893 --> 09:11.660
You know, there was something
I had to do first.

09:11.728 --> 09:13.828
Amy, I don't think
you understand how important

09:13.862 --> 09:15.230
this training schedule is!

09:15.264 --> 09:17.199
It's the world
equestrian games!

09:17.233 --> 09:18.567
I know.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.602
I realize you have some deal
to work with a horse -

09:20.636 --> 09:22.070
you've agreed to retrain him
or whatever-

09:22.105 --> 09:25.840
how do you know that?
Are you having me followed?

09:25.874 --> 09:28.543
Or are you following me?

09:28.578 --> 09:31.246
Follow you?!
Hardly!

09:31.280 --> 09:34.715
I simply phoned your house
and your sister told me.

09:35.650 --> 09:36.917
Oh...

09:36.951 --> 09:38.085
Lou, why would you
tell Ahmed anything

09:38.120 --> 09:39.686
about what I'm doing
with Ty and Caleb?

09:39.721 --> 09:41.021
He doesn't need
to know about that!

09:41.055 --> 09:42.623
I didn't realize
it was such a big secret!

09:42.657 --> 09:44.125
How was I supposed to know?

09:44.159 --> 09:45.826
Georgie! Dinner!

09:45.860 --> 09:47.228
I told Amy,

09:47.262 --> 09:49.730
it's only a matter of time
before that prince realizes

09:49.764 --> 09:51.332
he doesn't have her
full attention.

09:51.366 --> 09:52.533
Not good!

09:52.567 --> 09:54.034
I disagree.
I think it's a very good thing

09:54.068 --> 09:55.736
that she doesn't give that guy
her full attention.

09:55.770 --> 09:57.037
Okay, what is that
supposed to mean?!

09:57.071 --> 09:58.192
You know exactly what I mean.

09:58.205 --> 09:59.272
And where's Ty?

09:59.306 --> 10:00.540
I thought he was coming
for dinner!

10:00.608 --> 10:02.109
Yeah, well, I don't know.
He's super stressed out.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.243
The race is on Saturday

10:03.310 --> 10:04.678
and his horse still has
a big problem,

10:04.712 --> 10:06.412
and he and Caleb
don't have a rider!

10:06.447 --> 10:07.648
Caleb doesn't know
the difference between

10:07.682 --> 10:09.482
a futurity horse and a camel.

10:09.517 --> 10:11.157
Why Ty would ever do
this deal with him...

10:11.185 --> 10:13.786
Somebody's gotta talk
some sense into Ty!

10:13.820 --> 10:15.588
Jack, can you take
me into town tomorrow?

10:15.623 --> 10:18.158
The new trick saddle came in
at Maggie's, right, Lou?

10:18.192 --> 10:19.192
Yes, it did.

10:19.226 --> 10:20.326
I wanna go see it!

10:20.361 --> 10:21.628
Sorry, Georgie, I've got plans.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.396
I'm gonna be away
for a couple of days.

10:23.430 --> 10:24.397
Where are you going?

10:24.431 --> 10:25.898
Oh, something to attend to.

10:25.932 --> 10:27.167
Well, I hope you're back
by this weekend.

10:27.201 --> 10:29.101
The futurity race
is on Saturday.

10:29.136 --> 10:31.037
Yep, we're showing it
at Maggie's.

10:31.071 --> 10:32.272
Expecting a full house.

10:32.306 --> 10:33.572
Oh. Great.

10:33.640 --> 10:36.408
Yeah, I got three words for you:
Big. Screen. TV.

10:36.442 --> 10:37.677
Good idea, right?

10:37.711 --> 10:38.744
And I'm waitressing.

10:38.779 --> 10:40.345
You're gonna pay me,
right, Lou?

10:40.380 --> 10:42.214
Absolutely.

10:50.924 --> 10:52.524
What's wrong with you, man?

10:52.592 --> 10:54.693
It was just a late night.

10:57.429 --> 10:58.797
Okay...

10:58.831 --> 11:00.398
Here she goes.

11:04.670 --> 11:07.072
<i>Arghh! Come on, Charger!</i>

11:11.243 --> 11:13.410
<i>Okay, let's keep going, then.</i>

11:13.444 --> 11:14.978
So what happened last night?

11:15.046 --> 11:16.947
Well, Charlene called me up
out of the blue

11:17.015 --> 11:18.115
and asked me out.

11:18.183 --> 11:19.416
It turns out
she just wanted to tell me

11:19.483 --> 11:20.851
that she'd be riding
another guy's horse

11:20.919 --> 11:22.159
in the barrel race on Saturday.

11:28.626 --> 11:31.095
<i>I tried talking her</i>
<i>into switching.</i>

11:31.162 --> 11:32.596
Did it work?

11:32.663 --> 11:34.663
No, but I sure had a good time!

11:37.467 --> 11:38.588
- Well...
- Hey!

11:38.635 --> 11:40.002
I've gotta give you marks
for trying.

11:40.070 --> 11:41.170
Hi...

11:41.238 --> 11:42.238
Hi.

11:43.707 --> 11:46.142
<i>- I'm Charlene Young.</i>
<i>- Oh! Amy Fleming.</i>

11:46.210 --> 11:47.643
I've never seen you
on the circuit.

11:47.711 --> 11:49.545
I'm not a barrel racer.

11:49.613 --> 11:51.313
Oh, really.

11:51.381 --> 11:53.681
Well, that would explain
a few things.

11:53.716 --> 11:54.850
Amy's gonna figure out

11:54.884 --> 11:55.884
why Charger keeps doing
what he's doing

11:55.918 --> 11:57.552
and she's gonna fix him for us.

11:57.620 --> 11:59.420
Fix him? Okay, how?

12:00.823 --> 12:02.057
<i>As I'm sure you know,</i>

12:02.125 --> 12:04.126
a winning barrel horse
has to know how to rate

12:04.193 --> 12:08.130
and that's not something
you can fix in a hurry.

12:08.164 --> 12:10.431
In simple terms,
rating means slowing down

12:10.466 --> 12:13.401
and positioning the horse
properly for the barrel turn,

12:13.435 --> 12:15.603
and that's gonna take months
of time and practice.

12:15.638 --> 12:18.439
He knows how to rate.
He's got a great record.

12:18.507 --> 12:19.940
<i>Fine.</i>

12:19.975 --> 12:21.909
<i>But if you think you're gonna</i>
<i>fix this guy by Saturday,</i>

12:21.943 --> 12:25.647
well, let's just say,
I'm glad I'm not in your boots.

12:33.255 --> 12:35.156
Where exactly are you going?

12:35.190 --> 12:36.690
I'll keep in touch.

12:36.724 --> 12:39.260
Yeah, what's with
all the mystery?

12:39.294 --> 12:40.895
There's no mystery!

12:40.929 --> 12:42.797
Some things are private,
that's all.

12:42.831 --> 12:44.231
See you later!

12:46.734 --> 12:48.502
<i>I wonder where they are going?</i>

12:48.536 --> 12:51.138
<i>I have no idea!</i>

12:51.173 --> 12:52.206
You all set?

12:52.240 --> 12:53.807
Yep. Can you take me
to Maggie's

12:53.841 --> 12:55.541
to look at the new trick saddle
after school?

12:55.575 --> 12:56.609
Well, you can look.

12:56.643 --> 12:57.576
I will probably have
some work to do.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.279
Okay.

12:59.313 --> 13:00.513
No, you know what?
Scratch that.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.816
Let's be customers
for a change.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.684
We can grab a sundae
or something.

13:04.718 --> 13:06.786
<i>Spend some time together,</i>
<i>just me and you.</i>

13:06.821 --> 13:08.254
Sort of like, I don't know,

13:08.289 --> 13:11.157
a... mother/daughter date!

13:12.092 --> 13:13.492
Sure...

13:14.661 --> 13:16.562
Okay. Bye!

13:19.199 --> 13:21.279
Look, guys, I'm really
not sure what to tell you.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.835
He just explodes
out of the alley.

13:22.869 --> 13:23.869
He's not even thinking,

13:23.937 --> 13:26.004
he's just running
as fast as he can!

13:26.039 --> 13:28.106
He has to be taken
right back to basics!

13:28.141 --> 13:29.308
The race is Saturday.

13:29.343 --> 13:30.676
Yes, Caleb, I know!

13:30.711 --> 13:31.777
And I would love
to help you guys,

13:31.812 --> 13:33.111
but you realize this-

13:33.146 --> 13:35.146
it's not your problem.
Yeah, I...

13:35.214 --> 13:36.948
I- I do get it.

13:36.982 --> 13:41.820
So Amy tells me that this...
"Futurity horse"

13:41.887 --> 13:43.888
won't make the first barrel.

13:43.922 --> 13:45.757
<i>That's not good.</i>

13:45.825 --> 13:47.692
<i>I've seen a hundred horses</i>
<i>like this.</i>

13:47.760 --> 13:50.362
He's racey -
it means he likes to run -

13:50.429 --> 13:51.463
which is what he's gonna do.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.964
You guys are backing
the wrong horse.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.733
Look, Tim, this horse
was getting a lot of notice

13:54.767 --> 13:55.867
and his times were amazing.

13:55.934 --> 13:57.468
Ancient history, Caleb!

13:57.502 --> 14:00.537
You should've got out
before you got in!

14:00.605 --> 14:01.873
I mean you're gonna
embarrass yourself

14:01.907 --> 14:02.974
in front a bunch
of professionals

14:03.041 --> 14:04.162
who know what they're doing.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.343
You know how bad
that's gonna be?

14:05.377 --> 14:06.810
It's gonna look awful!

14:06.845 --> 14:10.147
Okay, guys, I'm sorry.
I gotta go to work.

14:10.215 --> 14:11.615
Okay, honey.

14:11.683 --> 14:14.485
Somebody's gotta make
some money.

14:14.552 --> 14:17.653
<i>So you finally made it.</i>

14:17.688 --> 14:19.856
Amy,

14:19.891 --> 14:21.858
I am asking you
to work with me,

14:21.926 --> 14:23.426
with my team.

14:23.494 --> 14:24.660
And if it goes well,

14:24.695 --> 14:26.763
this could open up
a whole new future for you.

14:26.830 --> 14:28.098
If you don't want that,
I understand.

14:28.165 --> 14:30.566
No, I do want that.
I do!

14:30.634 --> 14:33.770
But Ty needs my help
and he's my fiancee.

14:33.837 --> 14:35.972
I admire your loyalty,

14:36.040 --> 14:38.908
but you cannot forget that
we have an agreement as well.

14:38.942 --> 14:40.075
I know.

14:41.645 --> 14:44.447
I leave for the games
in a little over a week.

14:44.515 --> 14:46.549
I need Zeus up to speed.

14:47.518 --> 14:49.251
<i>And you need to make</i>
<i>a decision,</i>

14:49.319 --> 14:51.554
for yourself and for me,

14:51.588 --> 14:54.323
or I need to find
another trainer.

14:54.391 --> 14:55.758
Okay.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.307
Hey.

15:14.943 --> 15:16.543
Hey.

15:16.611 --> 15:20.080
I was just going through
my mom's journal.

15:21.315 --> 15:23.717
All the work that she did...

15:23.785 --> 15:26.319
She was amazing.

15:26.353 --> 15:28.956
And I think about everything
that she went through

15:28.990 --> 15:31.825
when my dad left and stuff
and...

15:31.893 --> 15:33.927
She was always so strong.

15:36.330 --> 15:38.465
My mom was completely
the opposite.

15:38.532 --> 15:39.800
What do you mean?

15:39.834 --> 15:41.068
<i>She depended on
my father completely</i>

15:41.602 --> 15:43.669
and when he took off,

15:43.704 --> 15:46.005
she let Wade move
right in there.

15:46.039 --> 15:49.709
And both those guys took her
for every penny that she had.

15:49.743 --> 15:52.745
<i>I hated watching it, so I uh...</i>

15:52.779 --> 15:57.483
I vowed to myself that
I'd never be like those guys.

15:57.517 --> 15:59.619
That's why I need to pull
my own weight, Amy!

15:59.653 --> 16:02.722
I can't live with myself
if I don't.

16:02.756 --> 16:05.725
And this whole
down payment thing,

16:05.759 --> 16:07.493
it's something I have to do.

16:07.527 --> 16:09.061
I get it.

16:09.096 --> 16:12.664
I'm sorry I ever got involved
with Caleb.

16:12.698 --> 16:16.868
But now that I am,
I have to see it through.

16:16.902 --> 16:18.036
I know.

16:21.707 --> 16:23.975
Do you wanna watch
the video with me?

16:24.010 --> 16:25.409
Yeah.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.949
Look how fast he is!
It's unbelievable!

16:34.286 --> 16:35.987
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

16:36.922 --> 16:38.322
What?

16:40.458 --> 16:43.927
Look at this.
Right... there!

16:43.995 --> 16:45.395
<i>You see how high his head is?</i>

16:45.463 --> 16:47.197
There's no way he can see
that first barrel!

16:47.231 --> 16:49.099
It's physically impossible
for him

16:49.167 --> 16:50.534
with his head that high!

16:50.601 --> 16:52.703
Well, there's gotta be a way
we can get around that.

16:52.737 --> 16:54.905
Yeah...
Maybe there is.

16:54.939 --> 16:57.174
How about I work with him
first thing tomorrow morning?

16:57.241 --> 16:58.842
Are you sure you're free?

16:58.877 --> 17:01.178
I guess.

17:01.245 --> 17:03.280
Ahmed gave me
a bit of an ultimatum.

17:03.347 --> 17:04.747
What did he say?

17:04.815 --> 17:05.948
Well, he's given me this chance

17:05.983 --> 17:08.218
to work with
an international team.

17:08.286 --> 17:10.720
It's an amazing opportunity,
and...

17:10.788 --> 17:12.789
Well, I'm kind of blowing it.

17:12.856 --> 17:14.391
He's not happy.

17:14.425 --> 17:15.592
Amy, I never wanted
to put your job

17:15.626 --> 17:17.194
at Hillhurst in jeopardy.

17:17.261 --> 17:19.061
No, you're not.

17:19.128 --> 17:21.049
I'll work with Charger
until the race on Saturday

17:21.098 --> 17:24.099
and then I'll decide
what I'm gonna do.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.535
What do you want to do?

17:27.671 --> 17:29.037
I don't know.

17:31.174 --> 17:34.210
Let's just focus on Charger
for now.

17:35.745 --> 17:37.779
Hey, come here.

17:44.554 --> 17:46.555
I appreciate your help.

17:46.623 --> 17:50.192
And from now on, any decisions?

17:50.227 --> 17:53.695
We'll make them together,
I promise.

17:55.030 --> 17:57.365
Hey, lights out, kiddo.

17:57.399 --> 17:58.733
Okay?

17:58.800 --> 18:01.802
Lou will be up in a minute,
she's just reading to Katie.

18:01.837 --> 18:03.304
You warm enough there?

18:03.372 --> 18:04.739
Um... yep.

18:05.708 --> 18:07.609
Can I ask you something?

18:07.676 --> 18:08.909
Sure.

18:08.944 --> 18:12.380
It's... Lou.
She's not herself.

18:13.815 --> 18:16.049
<i>Like today, she made a big deal</i>

18:16.083 --> 18:18.785
out of having
a mother/daughter day.

18:18.819 --> 18:20.254
She's never done that before.

18:20.288 --> 18:24.625
Well, it's kinda nice
though, don't you think?

18:24.659 --> 18:26.860
She just loves being your mom,
I think.

18:26.894 --> 18:29.195
You know, just like she loves
being Katie's mom.

18:29.264 --> 18:34.668
Yeah, but it's kinda
not the same, is it?

18:34.702 --> 18:37.671
No, it's not exactly the same,
but she is still your mom,

18:37.705 --> 18:40.307
just like I'm still your dad.

18:40.341 --> 18:41.708
And I tell you,
we both count ourselves

18:41.743 --> 18:44.177
pretty darn lucky
that we are, too.

18:48.383 --> 18:50.784
I've never called anyone
"mom" before.

18:52.419 --> 18:54.988
Jeff says my first word
was "dada."

18:55.923 --> 18:58.792
I don't remember my mom,
but... Jeff does.

18:59.894 --> 19:01.460
It's kinda weird.

19:03.164 --> 19:04.563
I bet it is.

19:07.902 --> 19:09.302
Good night.

19:13.340 --> 19:15.408
Good night.

19:29.222 --> 19:31.089
So where will the laser be?

19:31.124 --> 19:33.793
Uh, it's just gonna
be right about here.

19:33.827 --> 19:35.461
Okay...

19:35.495 --> 19:36.962
All right.

19:36.996 --> 19:38.731
I'm gonna try
and keep him collected

19:38.765 --> 19:40.533
and not give him his face.

19:40.567 --> 19:42.234
We'll see how this goes.

19:47.039 --> 19:48.606
There you go!

19:57.082 --> 19:59.451
Come on, come on, come on!

20:05.122 --> 20:06.423
How was my time?

20:06.458 --> 20:07.858
Well, he made it
around the first barrel,

20:07.925 --> 20:10.794
but a time like this is never
gonna guarantee us a payday.

20:10.862 --> 20:13.964
<i>You gotta let him run,</i>
<i>right from the start.</i>

20:14.031 --> 20:16.066
<i>Let's try something else.</i>

20:17.736 --> 20:18.769
Hyaaah!

20:21.138 --> 20:22.805
<i>Okay, lookin' better!</i>

20:22.840 --> 20:25.274
<i>Yeah! Keep it up, Amy!</i>

20:28.779 --> 20:30.913
Get up! Get up! Get up!

20:35.753 --> 20:38.421
<i>Come on, Amy, bring it home!
Bring it home!</i>

20:38.489 --> 20:40.022
Now we're talkin'!

20:40.990 --> 20:43.358
If Amy can get Charger
around the first barrel

20:43.426 --> 20:44.526
at top speed,

20:44.594 --> 20:46.728
we might just have a winner
on our hands.

20:46.796 --> 20:50.832
Caleb, winner?
We don't even have a rider!

20:52.402 --> 20:54.669
No, man, there's no way!
There's no way!

20:54.737 --> 20:56.104
I'm gonna ask her.

20:56.171 --> 20:58.239
We have a back-up plan.

20:58.307 --> 20:59.440
Charlene and I got together
last night,

20:59.474 --> 21:00.875
and let's just say,
she might be feeling

21:00.909 --> 21:03.277
a little differently
about things today.

21:03.344 --> 21:04.278
Caleb!

21:04.312 --> 21:06.146
He is definitely improving.

21:06.214 --> 21:08.449
Would you ride
in the futurity race for us?

21:08.517 --> 21:10.083
No, I won't.

21:10.151 --> 21:11.452
Come on, Amy!

21:11.486 --> 21:12.986
Caleb, I'm not a
professional barrel racer

21:13.021 --> 21:14.889
and that's what you guys need!

21:14.923 --> 21:17.257
Look, I'll keep working
with Charger until the race,

21:17.325 --> 21:19.293
but you need to keep looking
for a rider!

21:19.327 --> 21:21.294
I- I have.
I did...

21:29.870 --> 21:30.970
<i>Do you know
that the entire time</i>

21:31.038 --> 21:32.338
that Lou and I ran
this place together,

21:32.372 --> 21:34.774
I did not spend
even one night here!

21:35.976 --> 21:37.911
And it's so much nicer
without guests!

21:37.978 --> 21:39.813
Yeah, well, at least
we don't have to listen

21:39.847 --> 21:43.082
to your cleaning lady's
vacuum roaring away.

21:44.017 --> 21:45.977
I thought you brought
me here to be romantic,

21:45.986 --> 21:47.886
not to escape my cleaning lady!

21:47.921 --> 21:49.388
Huh!

21:49.423 --> 21:51.123
Oh, Jack!

21:51.158 --> 21:53.525
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.428
You didn't sleep well at all
last night, did you?

21:55.462 --> 21:57.830
Well, strange house,
strange noises.

21:58.765 --> 22:01.467
That furnace of yours
makes some crazy sounds

22:01.501 --> 22:03.001
goin' on and off.

22:03.035 --> 22:06.605
It does?
I never noticed that.

22:06.639 --> 22:08.640
But how was the company?
Was the company good?

22:08.675 --> 22:11.109
Oh, the company...

22:11.143 --> 22:13.211
The company was very good.

22:13.245 --> 22:15.280
Well, I hope
I don't keep you up!

22:17.450 --> 22:19.284
Is he fixed?

22:19.318 --> 22:22.153
Well, he's improved
incredibly, right, Amy?

22:22.188 --> 22:23.321
Yeah.

22:23.356 --> 22:24.489
Just
I don't know, guys.

22:24.523 --> 22:25.623
There was too much wrong
with this horse

22:25.691 --> 22:27.325
for him to be
an overnight miracle.

22:27.360 --> 22:30.528
Well, there was also
a lot right with him.

22:30.562 --> 22:32.630
Just give him a try.

22:34.700 --> 22:35.733
Yah!

22:40.938 --> 22:42.339
Oh! Come on!

22:49.080 --> 22:50.714
Okay, that was fun.

22:52.517 --> 22:54.851
So you got him around
the first barrel, did you?

22:54.919 --> 22:55.986
Yeah.

22:56.021 --> 22:58.087
Good for you. Show me.

23:01.025 --> 23:03.226
"Show me!"
That's what she said!

23:03.260 --> 23:06.396
And then I did
and it was a total disaster!

23:06.463 --> 23:08.331
I swear that Ty and Caleb
just brought her in there

23:08.365 --> 23:10.266
to make me feel bad
for not riding Charger!

23:10.300 --> 23:12.435
Yeah, but you never wanted
to do that anyway, did you?

23:12.503 --> 23:14.670
I mean, ride him
in the actual race?

23:14.704 --> 23:17.739
Well, all the same,
they bring in this girl

23:17.806 --> 23:19.474
who doesn't get the horse
at all!

23:19.509 --> 23:20.909
I don't care
if she's a professional, Lou.

23:20.943 --> 23:23.278
She doesn't understand
how the horse works

23:23.346 --> 23:24.379
and she's gonna ruin him!

23:24.447 --> 23:25.780
He'll never barrel race again!

23:25.814 --> 23:27.215
You wouldn't happen to be
just a little bit jealous,

23:27.283 --> 23:28.850
would you?

23:28.918 --> 23:30.552
No!

23:30.619 --> 23:32.521
I'm going to bed.

23:39.261 --> 23:40.994
<i>This is so crazy!</i>

23:41.063 --> 23:42.329
Why did we even come back here?

23:42.397 --> 23:44.231
We could've toughed it out
at the dude ranch!

23:44.266 --> 23:45.766
Well, you're
tougher than I am!

23:45.833 --> 23:47.668
That place was freezing
my butt off!

23:47.702 --> 23:50.337
All right, look, let's
just go back to my house.

23:50.405 --> 23:54.608
Lisa, I haven't slept maybe
10 minutes in the last 24 hours!

23:54.676 --> 23:56.277
I know, I know,
so let's just-

23:56.311 --> 23:59.280
I just need to be in my own bed
for one night.

23:59.314 --> 24:01.848
Besides, you have more pillows
than I have ever seen

24:01.916 --> 24:03.350
in my life!

24:03.418 --> 24:04.518
Oh, it's the pillows.

24:04.586 --> 24:06.320
Well, I practically
smothered in 'em.

24:06.388 --> 24:07.588
You know what this is about?

24:07.622 --> 24:09.390
This is about you
not wanting me

24:09.458 --> 24:10.757
to win the bet!

24:10.792 --> 24:12.125
Keep your voice down!

24:12.193 --> 24:13.493
Oh, see!

24:15.896 --> 24:17.597
Hey, guys.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.232
Everything uh... okay?

24:20.167 --> 24:21.501
Hi.

24:22.436 --> 24:24.870
What's going on?
Is everything all right?

24:24.905 --> 24:26.906
Everything is fine.

24:26.974 --> 24:28.774
So sorry to wake you up.
Sorry.

24:28.809 --> 24:29.942
Okay...

24:29.977 --> 24:32.612
Go back to bed, honey.

24:32.646 --> 24:33.679
Night, Lou.

24:33.714 --> 24:34.780
Night, Dad.

24:35.816 --> 24:38.283
Night.
Good night.

24:38.318 --> 24:39.685
See?

24:39.753 --> 24:41.120
Good night!

24:41.154 --> 24:42.955
This is all your fault!
Come on!

24:47.227 --> 24:48.594
Hot toddies.

24:48.629 --> 24:50.496
That's nice.

24:50.530 --> 24:51.864
So uh...

24:51.898 --> 24:54.565
Pretty crazy couple of nights,
I admit,

24:54.600 --> 24:56.768
but at least we didn't
kill each other

24:56.802 --> 24:58.970
and in spite of it,
we're still laughing, right?

25:04.476 --> 25:06.277
Here's the thing.

25:06.311 --> 25:09.080
You know, maybe I can't live
at Fairfield.

25:09.115 --> 25:11.716
Maybe you can't live here.

25:11.751 --> 25:13.284
And you won't give up
your place in France

25:13.318 --> 25:16.988
and I sure as heck
will not let this place go.

25:17.023 --> 25:19.624
But really, who cares?

25:19.658 --> 25:21.759
We've been down all those roads

25:21.793 --> 25:25.228
and back again and...

25:25.263 --> 25:28.866
And we still feel
the way we do.

25:28.900 --> 25:31.468
That's a pretty good feeling.

25:31.502 --> 25:33.671
It's a pretty great feeling.

25:33.705 --> 25:36.306
So here's the bottom line:

25:37.408 --> 25:39.143
We're two adults
that love each other,

25:39.210 --> 25:40.177
am I right?

25:40.211 --> 25:41.611
Yes, you are right.

25:41.646 --> 25:45.115
So then there should be
no problems,

25:45.150 --> 25:46.750
only solutions.

25:46.785 --> 25:49.452
What are those solutions?

25:51.690 --> 25:54.691
I let you slip through
my fingers once before

25:54.758 --> 25:58.161
and I am not about
to do it again.

26:00.231 --> 26:02.865
Now, this...

26:02.933 --> 26:06.736
Was my grandmother's
wedding ring...

26:08.972 --> 26:11.708
And I want you to have it.

26:13.377 --> 26:15.178
You know, I've been meaning
to say this the right way

26:15.246 --> 26:18.014
for a very, very long time.

26:19.517 --> 26:21.484
Lisa Stillman,

26:21.519 --> 26:25.487
will you do me the honour
of marrying me?

26:28.291 --> 26:29.225
What?

26:29.292 --> 26:31.827
Will you marry me, yes or no?

26:31.894 --> 26:36.031
I... uh, yes!
I will!

26:36.065 --> 26:37.433
Lord knows how we're
gonna make it work,

26:37.500 --> 26:40.703
but Jack Bartlett,
I will marry you!

26:52.154 --> 26:54.088
<i>I feel like a
teenager about to elope!</i>

26:54.156 --> 26:55.290
Yeah, me too!

26:56.626 --> 26:58.159
You sure you don't wanna
tell anybody?

26:58.227 --> 26:59.994
Well, do you want that?

27:00.062 --> 27:01.796
Well, only if you want to.

27:02.765 --> 27:05.032
No, we'll find a good time
to tell people,

27:05.100 --> 27:06.533
but until then, we'll just...

27:06.601 --> 27:08.101
Okay, agreed.

27:08.169 --> 27:10.671
We'll get it done
and then we'll tell people.

27:10.705 --> 27:12.573
I love this feeling!

27:13.841 --> 27:15.442
I'll make all
the arrangements, okay?

27:15.510 --> 27:16.910
Oh, you will-

27:16.978 --> 27:19.246
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi!

27:19.281 --> 27:20.648
- Morning.
- Morning.

27:20.715 --> 27:23.049
I'm on my way out.

27:23.117 --> 27:24.050
I'll see you soon.

27:24.118 --> 27:25.985
- Okay.
- See ya.

27:27.921 --> 27:29.188
Grandpa,

27:29.256 --> 27:31.991
is everything okay
with you two?

27:32.025 --> 27:34.093
Couldn't be better.

27:39.633 --> 27:41.401
That's it, Charger!

28:03.089 --> 28:04.249
- That was great!
- Yeah.

28:04.257 --> 28:06.157
- Best run yet!
- He felt awesome.

28:06.192 --> 28:08.426
Even around that first barrel
he did a lot better.

28:08.460 --> 28:10.228
Okay! News!

28:10.262 --> 28:12.730
Charlene's agreed to ride
Charger in the race!

28:12.764 --> 28:14.065
That's great!
Why? How?

28:14.099 --> 28:15.399
Well, never mind,
she's just gonna do it.

28:15.434 --> 28:16.835
No! No!

28:16.869 --> 28:18.036
She can't handle
this horse, okay?

28:18.070 --> 28:19.370
You're gonna have
to find someone else.

28:19.404 --> 28:20.504
The race is tomorrow.

28:20.539 --> 28:21.772
There's no time to find
someone else!

28:21.807 --> 28:22.941
You're just gonna need
to be reasonable, Amy.

28:22.975 --> 28:24.575
Fine!
I'll ride him!

28:24.609 --> 28:25.809
Okay?
Does that make you happy?

28:25.810 --> 28:27.077
I will ride Charger!

28:27.111 --> 28:28.678
<i>Fine!</i>

28:33.885 --> 28:35.886
There was no deal
with Charlene.

28:35.920 --> 28:38.989
No.

28:49.499 --> 28:50.666
<i>Hello, Amy?</i>

28:50.700 --> 28:51.968
In the office.

28:52.936 --> 28:53.903
Hello.

28:53.937 --> 28:56.172
Ahmed, hi.

28:56.206 --> 29:00.309
So I actually did
follow you today.

29:00.344 --> 29:01.577
Good to know.

29:01.644 --> 29:03.679
I watched you at the arena.

29:03.713 --> 29:05.681
Amazing sport!

29:05.715 --> 29:08.251
First time for me, seeing that.

29:08.318 --> 29:10.686
It reminded me of why
I wanted to work with you

29:10.754 --> 29:12.154
in the first place.

29:12.222 --> 29:14.023
Really?

29:14.057 --> 29:18.928
You are determined.
You are unstoppable!

29:18.962 --> 29:21.562
So I made a decision.

29:21.630 --> 29:23.431
When you've finished
your work with Charger,

29:23.499 --> 29:26.534
I want you to come back
to work for me.

29:26.602 --> 29:27.869
Oh, okay...

29:27.904 --> 29:29.905
But I also want you to come
to Europe with my team

29:29.972 --> 29:32.840
when we go to the world
equestrian games next week!

29:32.875 --> 29:34.175
What?

29:34.243 --> 29:35.543
Mm-hmm!

29:35.577 --> 29:38.679
Ahmed, that's... That
is an incredible offer.

29:38.747 --> 29:41.716
Yes, it is.

29:41.784 --> 29:44.019
So what do you say?

29:44.086 --> 29:45.387
Well, I...

29:45.454 --> 29:49.657
I'm gonna have to think
about it, I...

29:49.725 --> 29:51.726
Besides, you'll probably
change your mind

29:51.794 --> 29:54.396
after I mess up
at the futurity race tomorrow.

29:55.398 --> 29:56.898
You'll be fine.

29:56.966 --> 30:00.435
Trust yourself.
Trust your instincts.

30:00.502 --> 30:02.937
After all,
you are the miracle girl.

30:03.004 --> 30:04.038
Mm.

30:09.478 --> 30:13.347
Anyway, I hope you will take
my proposal seriously.

30:13.381 --> 30:14.449
I will.

30:23.826 --> 30:25.092
<i>Georgie!</i>

30:25.126 --> 30:26.627
It's time to get going, honey!

30:26.662 --> 30:27.961
Has Amy left yet?

30:28.028 --> 30:29.162
Are you kidding?

30:29.196 --> 30:31.431
<i>I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>that she left at dawn.</i>

30:31.499 --> 30:34.601
Now, you're gonna be at Maggie's
to watch the race, right?

30:34.669 --> 30:36.169
You know that
Amy's riding Charger?

30:36.203 --> 30:37.671
Yes, I know all about it.

30:37.705 --> 30:38.672
She's crazy!

30:38.706 --> 30:39.673
Why do you have your suit bag?

30:40.708 --> 30:42.876
Oh! I'll be right back.

30:45.580 --> 30:47.580
Jack, what's going on here?

30:47.614 --> 30:49.449
That's your blue suit.

30:49.516 --> 30:50.649
As far as I know,

30:50.684 --> 30:51.817
you only wear that
for weddings and funerals

30:51.852 --> 30:54.820
and I don't know
about anybody who's died!

30:54.855 --> 30:58.124
Jack?
So what-

31:01.795 --> 31:04.397
No way!

31:10.412 --> 31:12.379
<i>Here they are,
ladies and gentlemen!</i>

31:12.448 --> 31:15.617
<i>Let's hear it</i>
<i>for our beautiful flag bearers!</i>

31:20.039 --> 31:21.806
Oh, Stephen!
I saved you a spot.

31:21.840 --> 31:23.108
Thanks.

31:23.142 --> 31:25.377
<i>There you go.</i>

31:27.913 --> 31:29.280

31:39.324 --> 31:40.257

31:40.325 --> 31:42.159
You feelin' okay?

31:42.193 --> 31:43.594
I'm terrified!

31:44.897 --> 31:46.964
You're gonna be great!

32:04.382 --> 32:06.283
- Hey, Jack.
- Randy.

32:06.317 --> 32:08.685
- Nice day!
- Thanks for coming.

32:09.620 --> 32:11.588
The events are starting!

32:11.622 --> 32:14.791
<i>This is Sizzlin' Speedball

32:33.611 --> 32:34.945
<i>13.841 seconds!</i>

32:34.979 --> 32:37.980
Look at those times!
I don't stand a chance.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.720
That really raised the bar.

32:44.788 --> 32:46.055
Lou?

32:46.123 --> 32:48.391
You remember Stephen, right?

32:48.459 --> 32:50.159
Yes, but um...

32:50.227 --> 32:52.228
I don't think we were
properly introduced.

32:52.262 --> 32:54.197
Oh! Well, Stephen,
this is...

32:54.231 --> 32:56.299
Lou... my mom.

32:58.735 --> 33:00.502
Hi.

Hi.

33:29.598 --> 33:31.439
<i>What a great run!
Look at that time!</i>

33:33.301 --> 33:34.702
Thank you.

33:51.452 --> 33:53.987
You look so beautiful!

33:54.022 --> 33:56.156
Thank you.

33:56.190 --> 33:58.491
I knew you'd get good use
out of that suit!

34:00.461 --> 34:01.794
Hi.

34:04.331 --> 34:07.066
Ha ha! I knew it!

34:07.100 --> 34:10.570

34:37.664 --> 34:38.630
Wow!

34:38.665 --> 34:39.996
She's good...

34:40.031 --> 34:41.199
Really good.

34:41.233 --> 34:43.301
Yeah, definitely the one
Amy has to beat.

34:53.212 --> 34:54.277
<i>That was amazing!</i>

34:54.313 --> 34:57.781
Where is Grandpa?
Honey, where's Dad?

34:59.184 --> 35:01.085
You see how good
I can read you?

35:01.119 --> 35:02.686
This is supposed
to be a secret.

35:02.721 --> 35:04.321
<i>It needs to be kept a secret,</i>

35:04.355 --> 35:07.825
so I suggest you just go back
the way you came!

35:07.859 --> 35:09.993
No! No way!

35:10.028 --> 35:11.729
No, you...

35:11.763 --> 35:14.264
You need a witness.
You need a best man.

35:14.298 --> 35:16.666
Who better than the man
that saved your life?

35:16.701 --> 35:18.769
Your son-in-law,
me?!

35:21.272 --> 35:24.541
Ex son-in-law.

35:28.947 --> 35:31.114
You wanna stand up with me?

35:31.181 --> 35:32.215
It'd be my honour.

35:44.828 --> 35:46.963
Okay!
This is amazing!

35:46.997 --> 35:48.765
You look so beautiful.
Congratulations!

You're gonna be fine, okay?

36:15.692 --> 36:16.992
<i>Just take a breath.</i>

36:19.528 --> 36:22.230

36:46.788 --> 36:49.990
But then I'm gonna let you go,

36:50.058 --> 36:52.259
But you just gotta wait for it.

36:52.294 --> 36:53.928
Okay, when you're ready!

Okay...

37:06.940 --> 37:08.273
<i>What is she doing?!</i>

37:08.308 --> 37:10.142
How does she expect to win
a race going backwards?!

37:10.176 --> 37:13.379
<i>Well, folks, there's a
tactic I've never seen before!</i>

37:13.413 --> 37:15.481
