WEBVTT

00:06.840 --> 00:08.757
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.

00:08.925 --> 00:11.301
You know, instead of watching football,
you could help.

00:11.469 --> 00:13.178
We know.

00:14.305 --> 00:17.975
Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows
in concentric circles.

00:19.436 --> 00:22.438
No, you want to put them
in concentric circles.

00:22.605 --> 00:24.648
I want to do this.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.076
Every year.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.709
To the 10, to the 5. Touchdown, Giants!

01:26.544 --> 01:31.173
You know, for once, I am gonna try
to watch one of these things.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.759
Halftime.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.931
Who wants to, uh, throw the ball around?
Get a little 3-on-3 going?

01:39.099 --> 01:41.809
- Oh, that would be so much fun!
- Can I play too?

01:41.976 --> 01:44.394
I've never played football, ever.

01:44.562 --> 01:46.021
Great! You can cover Chandler.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.400
I don't... I don't really want to play.

01:51.402 --> 01:53.612
You never do anything
since you and Janice broke up.

01:53.780 --> 01:54.822
Not true.

01:54.989 --> 01:58.534
I wanted to wear my bathrobe
and eat peanut clusters all day.

01:58.701 --> 02:01.995
And start drinking in the morning.
Don't say I don't have goals!

02:02.831 --> 02:05.374
You have to start getting
over her, all right?

02:05.542 --> 02:09.336
If you play, maybe it'll
take your mind off Janice.

02:09.503 --> 02:13.966
If you don't, everyone will be mad at
you because the teams won't be even.

02:14.884 --> 02:15.968
All right, I'll play.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.387
- Yay!
- Yay! Let's do it! Ross?

02:18.555 --> 02:20.514
- What?
- Wanna play football?

02:22.225 --> 02:23.433
Um...

02:23.601 --> 02:26.687
Monica and I aren't supposed
to play football.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.898
Says who? Your mom? Ha-ha-ha.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.358
Yes.

02:33.486 --> 02:37.906
Ahem. Every Thanksgiving, um,
we used to have a touch football game...

02:38.074 --> 02:39.700
...called The Geller Bowl.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.202
No, no, no. You say that proudly!

02:43.288 --> 02:46.707
Anyway, Ross and I
were always captains, and, um...

02:46.875 --> 02:50.544
It got kind of competitive.
And one year, Geller Bowl VI...

02:50.712 --> 02:53.964
...I accidentally broke Ross' nose.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.593
It was so not an accident.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.845
She saw I was about to tag her,
so she threw...

03:00.013 --> 03:03.140
...her big fat grandma-arm
elbow in my face...

03:03.308 --> 03:05.225
...and just kept running.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.394
To score the winning touchdown,
by the way.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.188
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Heh.

03:09.355 --> 03:12.232
Uh, you did not win the game.
The touchdown didn't count...

03:12.400 --> 03:17.321
...because of the spectacularly illegal,
and savage, nose-breaking.

03:18.573 --> 03:19.865
I won the game.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.452
Yeah? Then how come you
didn't get the Geller Cup?

03:24.621 --> 03:26.914
Ahem, there was a Geller Cup?

03:27.582 --> 03:30.250
Yes, the trophy you got
if you won the game.

03:30.418 --> 03:33.837
But Dad said nobody won,
and he was sick of our fighting.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.256
So he took the trophy...

03:42.555 --> 03:44.514
...threw it in the lake.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.267
And was the curse lifted?

03:49.354 --> 03:50.979
Anyway...

03:51.564 --> 03:54.441
...Mom said we weren't
allowed to play football again.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.986
You know what?
I think we should play a game.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.030
I mean, come on. It's been 12 years.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.950
Can I see you for a second?

04:07.413 --> 04:08.455
Wuss!

04:08.623 --> 04:10.999
All right, we're gonna play.

04:11.459 --> 04:15.337
Wait. How we gonna get there?
My mom won't let me cross the street.

04:20.885 --> 04:22.302
Here you go.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.720
All right.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.514
- Let's bring it in.
- Wait.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.140
Honey, throw it to me!

04:27.308 --> 04:29.559
- Here you go.
- Aah!

04:31.104 --> 04:33.772
That almost hit me in the face!

04:33.940 --> 04:35.732
We have to pick captains.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.151
And then "Tennilles."

04:40.196 --> 04:41.655
So how do we decide that?

04:41.823 --> 04:44.074
- Why don't we just bunny up?
- What?

04:44.242 --> 04:46.326
- Bunny!
- Bunny!

04:47.328 --> 04:49.162
Looks like Ross and I are captains.

04:49.330 --> 04:53.208
Okay, so, um, I bunnied first,
so I get to pick first. Joey.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.335
- Thank you.
- Monica.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.337
I'm your best friend.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.715
Sweetie, don't worry, you'll get picked.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.717
Chandler.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.637
- Ross?
- Phoebe.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.976
Sweetie, now I pick you.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.563
You don't pick me.
You're stuck with me!

05:15.398 --> 05:16.898
Okay. All right. So let's see.

05:17.066 --> 05:20.319
Let's play from the, uh,
trash can to the light post, right?

05:20.486 --> 05:21.862
Two-hand touch. We'll kick off.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.740
People, listen.
I've got 28 minutes...

05:24.907 --> 05:27.075
...before I have to baste again.

05:27.243 --> 05:29.202
Wow, just like in the pros.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.538
- Okay, huddle up! Whoo!
- Woo-hoo.

05:31.706 --> 05:35.417
- Huddle up over here!
- Wait for me! Wait for me!

05:35.710 --> 05:37.502
Oh, cool! My first huddle.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.504
- Okay.
- Ha, ha. Okay.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.799
So what do you guys really think
of Chandler?

05:44.385 --> 05:47.095
- You know what you're doing, right?
- Yeah.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.556
Okay. Joey will catch it. We'll block.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.391
What's "block"?

05:51.601 --> 05:55.687
- I thought you knew what you were doing.
- I thought you meant in life!

05:56.689 --> 05:58.231
Break!

05:58.399 --> 06:01.610
The ball is Janice.
The ball is Janice.

06:06.949 --> 06:09.201
Ow! Son of a...! Ow!

06:09.369 --> 06:11.411
- Come on!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.081
You know what?
We're just gonna throw it.

06:15.666 --> 06:16.917
I got it!

06:17.085 --> 06:18.502
Go, go, go!

06:27.303 --> 06:30.472
Score! Seven to nothing!

06:30.973 --> 06:31.973
Honey, you okay?

06:32.141 --> 06:33.475
Come on, let's go.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.310
Whoo. Losers walk.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.146
Yeah? Losers talk.

06:38.314 --> 06:40.941
No, no, actually, losers rhyme.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.361
Forty-three...

06:44.529 --> 06:45.612
...74...

06:49.784 --> 06:51.284
- You wanna go shotgun?
- Yeah.

06:53.830 --> 06:54.871
Hike.

06:55.039 --> 06:57.958
- One Mississippi...
- Over here! Over here! Unh.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.043
Ha! I almost caught that one!

07:01.629 --> 07:04.631
Great. Now the score's
seven to almost seven.

07:05.174 --> 07:09.803
Okay, on this play, I want you to do
a down-and-out to the right, okay?

07:09.971 --> 07:11.763
- Break!
- Wait. What am I gonna do?

07:11.931 --> 07:13.223
You?

07:13.391 --> 07:14.433
You go long.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.892
How long?

07:16.060 --> 07:17.894
Until we start to look very small.

07:18.062 --> 07:20.772
- Okay. Break!
- Break!

07:20.940 --> 07:22.983
- Set, hike!
- One Mississippi...

07:23.151 --> 07:24.860
Switch! Switch! Switch!

07:25.027 --> 07:26.778
No, no, no, no!

07:32.827 --> 07:34.953
Huhh...

07:35.955 --> 07:38.165
Hey. Thanks for stopping our ball.

07:38.332 --> 07:40.292
You are playing American football?

07:40.460 --> 07:41.501
Yeah.

07:41.669 --> 07:44.713
Wow, you're, like,
from a whole other country!

07:45.423 --> 07:48.550
- I'm Dutch.
- Hi, I'm Joey.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.260
I am Margha.

07:51.053 --> 07:54.055
- Sorry, Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
- Ha-ha-ha.

07:54.223 --> 07:56.892
You wanna play football or...?
Hi, I'm Chandler.

07:57.059 --> 07:58.935
Hello, Chandler.

07:59.103 --> 08:02.522
Her name is Dutch and also "Margham."

08:03.232 --> 08:05.275
- Margha.
- Margha.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.568
Margha.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.446
Mahan.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.782
Come on, guys! Let's go!
Second down!

08:13.743 --> 08:16.786
- Uh, hello? It's third down.
- No, it's not. It's second.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.998
- Wow.
- "Wow" what?

08:20.166 --> 08:24.085
It just amazes me that you're
still pulling stuff like this. Heh.

08:24.754 --> 08:28.715
- Pulling what? It's second down.
- Okay, it's second down.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.635
Take all the second downs you need.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.554
- I heard that.
- Well, I said it loud.

08:36.432 --> 08:38.558
It is okay if I stay and watch?

08:38.726 --> 08:41.895
- Just sit right there.
- Yeah, why don't you stick around?

08:42.063 --> 08:43.772
- That went well.
- I think so.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.900
I was thinking about, uh,
asking her for her number.

08:47.068 --> 08:50.946
Thanks, man, but it makes a stronger
statement if I ask for it myself.

08:53.157 --> 08:57.911
I was thinking about for me, as part
of that getting-over-Janice thing.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.121
Oh, yeah. That.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.874
If it means that much,
I'll let you have her.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.125
Thanks.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.128
Wh...? "Let me have her"?

09:07.964 --> 09:10.590
You mean if you didn't,
I wouldn't have a shot?

09:11.217 --> 09:13.593
I don't like to say it out loud...

09:14.220 --> 09:15.387
...but yeah!

09:16.764 --> 09:20.141
We all have our strengths.
You're better with numbers and stuff.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.895
Math? You're giving me math?

09:24.814 --> 09:27.148
All right, you know what?
Forget about it.

09:27.316 --> 09:29.693
You go for the girl.
We'll see who gets her.

09:33.823 --> 09:37.033
I want you to run a post-pattern
to the left. And, sweetie...

09:37.201 --> 09:38.535
Yeah, I know. Go long.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.288
All I'm doing is running
back and forth from the huddle.

09:42.915 --> 09:46.585
Well, uh, you wanna just stay out there?

09:47.169 --> 09:49.254
- Can I see that for a second?
- Yeah.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.467
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.177
- I got Chandler
- Hike!

09:56.345 --> 09:58.972
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.682
Fumble!

10:06.939 --> 10:09.649
What's the matter with you?
This is my favorite jersey.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.277
Well, now you have two.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.655
Hey, I am good at math!

10:16.616 --> 10:18.867
That's it.
I was still gonna let you have her.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.786
But now,
prepare to feel bad about yourself.

10:21.954 --> 10:25.290
I've been preparing for that
my entire life!

10:25.958 --> 10:28.168
Or something about you that's mean!

10:28.711 --> 10:30.503
Come on, guys. Let's go.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.589
Tie score.
We're running out of time.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.257
Forty-two, 38, hike!

10:35.760 --> 10:37.677
I got it! Ooh! Ugh!

10:37.845 --> 10:40.138
Broken boobs! Ow.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.724
- Pheebs, run!
- Run, Phoebe! Run!

10:42.892 --> 10:45.935
- God! Touchdown! Touchdown!
- Yes! Touchdown! Hey, oh!

10:46.604 --> 10:49.022
No, no, no.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.858
Uh, the buzzer buzzed.
It doesn't count.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.110
- After the snap.
- Before the snap.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.487
- After.
- Before.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.405
- Does it really matter?
- Yes!

10:57.657 --> 11:01.284
But I made a touchdown.
It was my first touchdown.

11:01.452 --> 11:04.245
Pheebs, that's great. Doesn't count.

11:04.413 --> 11:07.040
- Does so count.
- Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.710
Oh, my God!

11:11.837 --> 11:15.674
That's fine. Maybe you haven't
grown up, but I have.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.592
- Oh, okay.
- Dead leg!

11:17.760 --> 11:19.678
Ugh, oh! Oh.

11:19.845 --> 11:23.264
Okay, fine. You want to win
by cheating, go ahead.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.392
The touchdown does count. You win.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.686
- Whoo! Yay!
- No!

11:28.771 --> 11:32.649
I won't do this again. I wanna
beat you when you can't blame it...

11:32.817 --> 11:36.736
...on the broken nose or the buzzer
or the fact that you might have mono.

11:36.904 --> 11:40.365
Let's just call this tie score
and it's halftime.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.117
First, I don't play with cheaters.

11:42.284 --> 11:45.286
Second of all,
you know I had swollen glands!

11:47.456 --> 11:49.582
You know what? I think you'll play.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.001
Oh, really? Why's that?

11:52.169 --> 11:54.045
Because the winner gets this.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.840
The Geller Cup!

11:59.343 --> 12:02.345
Is everybody else seeing
a troll doll nailed to a two-by-four?

12:02.513 --> 12:03.763
Mm-hm.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.057
Okay, good.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.523
Okay, where the hell did you get that?

12:13.691 --> 12:15.984
When you went to the hospital
for your nose...

12:16.152 --> 12:18.987
...I swam into the lake
and fished it out.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.280
That cup is mine!

12:20.448 --> 12:23.575
No, it's not. You want it,
you're gonna have to win it.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.036
So are we not having dinner at all?

12:27.204 --> 12:30.999
Come on, let's go.
It's time to get serious. Huddle up.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.543
Keep your head in the game.

12:33.711 --> 12:37.046
It's hard, you know?
His huddle's close to the Dutch girl.

12:38.424 --> 12:42.051
If I take Chandler out of the running,
will you be able to focus?

12:42.219 --> 12:45.180
- What are you gonna do?
- Just make sure he catches the ball.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.347
I'll do the rest.

12:46.515 --> 12:49.434
- Come on, you wuss!
- Okay, come on.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.061
- Go, Cha... Chandler.
- I got it!

12:52.229 --> 12:54.355
Come on! This way! Come on!

12:54.774 --> 12:56.524
- Look out!
- Oof!

12:58.402 --> 12:59.778
Whoa, whoa.

12:59.945 --> 13:03.031
Tackled by a girl!
Bet you don't see that every day.

13:04.241 --> 13:06.701
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's with the tackling?

13:06.869 --> 13:08.703
What?

13:08.871 --> 13:10.580
I just touched him and he went over.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.751
Okay. You wanna play rough?
We can play rough.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.879
Let's get ready to rumble!

13:33.938 --> 13:35.146
Aah!

13:57.753 --> 13:59.921
- Go, go, go!
- Get her! Get her!

14:03.884 --> 14:05.635
I love this game!

14:08.681 --> 14:09.889
Where'd you get that?

14:10.724 --> 14:12.600
I went really long.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.812
Forty-two to 21.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.439
Like the turkey, Ross is done!

14:20.067 --> 14:23.278
You got to pick first,
so you got the better team.

14:23.445 --> 14:26.447
Pathetic! Why can't you
just accept that we're winning...

14:26.615 --> 14:27.949
...because I'm better than you?

14:28.117 --> 14:31.995
- Pfft!
- Oh, what a great argument. Exhaling!

14:32.746 --> 14:34.497
All right, I'll prove it to you. Okay?

14:34.665 --> 14:38.585
I'll trade you Joey for Rachel
and I'll still win the game.

14:38.752 --> 14:41.129
What? The guys against the girls?

14:41.297 --> 14:44.841
That's ridiculous because
I'm only down by three touchdowns.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.759
Oh, then bring it on!

14:46.927 --> 14:50.221
Unless you're afraid you might lose
to a bunch of girls.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.810
Fine. Rachel, you're with Monica.
Joey, you're with me.

14:56.103 --> 14:58.146
I can not believe you're trading me.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.482
Let's see what it's like
to be on a winning team for a change.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.318
You're gonna let me play?

15:03.777 --> 15:05.278
All right, then!

15:06.113 --> 15:07.906
The game is over? We eat now?

15:08.073 --> 15:09.991
No, the game's not over.
We're switching teams.

15:10.159 --> 15:14.537
Chandler finds me so intimidating that
it's better if we're on the same team.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.789
Okay, let's play. Let's go.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.374
Oh, uh, hold on a second.

15:18.542 --> 15:21.085
Ahem.
Where do Dutch people come from?

15:28.552 --> 15:30.511
Uh, well, the, uh...

15:30.679 --> 15:33.932
...Pennsylvania Dutch
come from Pennsylvania.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.517
And the, uh, other Dutch people?

15:36.685 --> 15:39.479
They come from somewhere near
the Netherlands, right?

15:39.647 --> 15:41.522
Nice try.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.942
The Netherlands
is this make-believe place...

15:44.109 --> 15:47.111
...where Peter Pan
and Tinker Bell come from.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.864
Oh, my.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.701
Enough "geography for the insane."
Let's play ball.

15:53.869 --> 15:56.245
No. No, I'm not playing with this guy.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.998
- Oh, fine with me.
- I've had enough of this.

15:59.166 --> 16:03.086
Let's just cut to the chase.
Heidi, which of my boys do you like?

16:04.046 --> 16:05.088
What are you doing?

16:05.255 --> 16:06.881
- What are you doing?
- Shh, shh.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.093
Which do I like?

16:10.260 --> 16:14.013
Yeah, for dating, general merriment,
taking back to your windmill?

16:14.682 --> 16:17.266
Well, if I had to choose right now...

16:17.434 --> 16:20.144
...which, by the way,
I find really weird...

16:21.563 --> 16:23.648
...I would have to say Chandler.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.400
Yes!

16:26.193 --> 16:29.570
Wait a minute.
She didn't understand the question.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.949
Why don't you have Captain Hook
explain it to her?

16:34.284 --> 16:36.369
I'm sorry. That is my truth.

16:36.537 --> 16:40.123
You hear that? That is her truth,
Mr. "I'll Let You Have Her"!

16:40.290 --> 16:43.084
I win! You suck! I rule all!

16:43.252 --> 16:45.878
Mini-wave in celebration of me!

16:47.047 --> 16:48.881
Woo-hoo!

16:49.842 --> 16:55.013
I am now thinking I would like
to change my answer to "no one."

16:55.180 --> 16:56.764
What?

16:57.349 --> 16:59.851
I now find you shallow, and, um...

17:00.019 --> 17:01.769
...a dork.

17:02.312 --> 17:03.855
Bye-bye.

17:04.356 --> 17:05.857
Heh. Nice going.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.693
You just saved yourself
a couple months of sex.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.904
It doesn't matter,
because she picked me.

17:12.071 --> 17:14.156
From now on, I get the dates...

17:14.324 --> 17:17.952
...and you stay home on Saturday nights
watching Ready, Set, Cook!

17:18.494 --> 17:21.372
Save the breakthroughs for therapy.
The clock is ticking.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.250
We have no time,
and we are losing to girls.

17:24.417 --> 17:26.044
We're not gonna lose to girls.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.795
It's 42-21!

17:27.963 --> 17:31.424
This sucks! I was just up by that much!

17:32.426 --> 17:35.928
Are we playing football or what?
Come on, you hairy-backed Marys!

17:37.514 --> 17:40.850
We have to do this.
We're playing for women everywhere.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.561
Think about every lousy date
you ever had.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.773
Every guy who kept one eye
on the TV while you were making out.

17:46.940 --> 17:50.193
Oh, my God. You dated someone
with a glass eye too?

17:52.029 --> 17:55.990
Come on, okay? This is for
all womankind. Let's kill them!

17:56.158 --> 17:57.867
Yeah! Kill them!

17:59.119 --> 18:01.412
All right, I want to kill them too.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.247
But they're boys.

18:03.415 --> 18:06.375
You know, how are we gonna
beat three boys?

18:35.864 --> 18:38.574
A minute and a half left,
and we're down by two points.

18:38.742 --> 18:39.951
Two points, ladies.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.376
Phoebe, you do a buttonhook again.

18:48.544 --> 18:49.919
Rachel, you go long.

18:50.087 --> 18:53.840
No, don't make me go long.
Use me. They never cover me.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.758
Honey, there's a reason.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.762
I'm not lame, okay?
I can do something.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.515
Would you let me throw?
This is my game too.

19:02.724 --> 19:04.392
Let her throw the ball.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.271
Sweep behind, I'll pitch it.
You throw it downfield to Phoebe.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.522
Thank you.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.065
- Break!
- Break!

19:11.233 --> 19:12.900
All right, here we go.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.361
Thirty-two, 71, hike!

19:15.529 --> 19:17.947
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three Mississippi!

19:23.412 --> 19:24.996
Go, go, go!

19:25.747 --> 19:27.123
- Catch it!
- Ow!

19:29.418 --> 19:32.420
- I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

19:33.755 --> 19:36.215
They were coming at me,
and I didn't know what to do.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.467
- Thirty seconds left on the timer.
Woo-hoo.

19:38.635 --> 19:41.762
So we get to take that, uh,
stupid troll thing home.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.891
Come on! Hurry!
We're running out of time.

19:45.058 --> 19:46.767
- Huddle up!
- Okay.

19:48.228 --> 19:51.105
Oh! This is our last huddle!

19:51.940 --> 19:54.942
All right, Phoebe, get open. Rachel...

19:55.110 --> 19:57.612
...go long.
- Okay.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.488
Break!

20:46.662 --> 20:49.413
Ahh! I did it! Touchdown! We did it!

20:53.126 --> 20:57.463
You know? Funny thing, actually.
The end zone starts at that pole.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.674
So you're five feet short. So...

20:59.841 --> 21:02.551
...ha-ha-ha, we win!
- Whoo!

21:03.845 --> 21:05.304
Yes, yes, yes!

21:05.472 --> 21:07.515
Wait, explain something, though.

21:07.683 --> 21:12.019
If nobody tagged Rachel,
then isn't the play still going?

21:17.234 --> 21:19.735
- Let me in! Let me in!
- No way! Let go!

21:19.903 --> 21:22.863
Let go? I'm a tiny little woman!

21:23.323 --> 21:25.324
Guys, come on, it's Thanksgiving!

21:25.492 --> 21:27.868
It's not important who wins or loses.

21:28.036 --> 21:30.997
The important thing
is the Dutch girl picked me!

21:33.000 --> 21:37.169
Me, not you! Holland loves Chandler!
Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!

21:41.383 --> 21:42.717
Ow!

21:44.886 --> 21:46.971
We should play football
more often.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.640
Maybe there's a league
we could join.

21:49.891 --> 21:52.935
Isn't there a "national football league"?

21:53.854 --> 21:56.605
Yes, there is. They play on
Sundays and Monday nights.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.400
Oh, shoot! I work Monday nights.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.901
Aww.

22:02.070 --> 22:05.948
This stuffing is amazing.
Do you think we should bring them some?

22:06.116 --> 22:08.200
When they're hungry, they'll come in.

22:08.368 --> 22:11.245
- Let go!
- No, you let go!

22:13.206 --> 22:16.250
How come it's always us
left holding the ball?

22:16.418 --> 22:20.254
I don't know. I guess the other
people just don't care enough.

22:25.927 --> 22:28.804
Hey, it's starting to snow.

22:33.060 --> 22:36.228
- Give it to me! Let go!
- Let it go! Come on, let go!
