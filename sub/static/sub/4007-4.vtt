00:10.560 --> 00:11.789
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:12.000 --> 00:15.880
<i>I've come to believe that the killer
could be one of my former patients.</i>

00:16.120 --> 00:17.839
He sent both packages to you.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.720
He doesn't know how to find me.
Yet.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.560
Well, I need to get to him
before he gets to me.

00:23.760 --> 00:27.276
I've got my eye on Joey Quinn.
Quinn? There's no way he can pass

00:27.480 --> 00:29.278
that sergeant exam.
He'll pass.

00:29.480 --> 00:33.076
I stuck my neck out on the line for you,
and you better not fuck this up.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.356
Lieutenant Morgan?

00:34.520 --> 00:36.079
Is there a problem, officer?

00:36.280 --> 00:38.840
Well, yes. You're in a car,
drunk, with an open container.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.153
Quinn.
Why did she call you?

00:42.360 --> 00:45.910
She's a friend. I couldn't say no.
Come on, you used to fuck her.

00:46.120 --> 00:49.079
There is nothing going on
between me and Deb.

00:49.280 --> 00:52.956
I wanna know if there was anything
unusual about my father's death.

00:53.160 --> 00:54.389
He killed himself, Dexter.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.672
<i>Harry walked in on what he created.</i>

00:57.880 --> 00:59.473
<i>And he couldn't live with himself.</i>

00:59.680 --> 01:00.716
<i>Trust me when I say</i>

01:00.880 --> 01:02.872
<i>that there's a place
in this world for your son.</i>

01:03.120 --> 01:04.554
I told you, you're perfect.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.150
How can you say that when
you know what I've done to Deb?

01:07.800 --> 01:08.870
Unh!

01:09.040 --> 01:11.032
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.197
Your sister confessed
to killing LaGuerta.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.756
What?
I'm telling the whole fucking truth!

01:15.960 --> 01:17.917
There's nothing you can do
to stop me!

01:18.440 --> 01:21.239
I thought I could fix this,
but you're right, I can't.

01:21.440 --> 01:23.875
I just keep making her worse.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.233
Do you really think
you can help her?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.480
Yes.

03:23.800 --> 03:24.995
Stop!

03:26.840 --> 03:28.399
Do it, Debra. Shoot him.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.595
This is not who you are.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.318
You are a good cop.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.110
You're a good person.
You're not like him.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.070
Put him down!

03:44.960 --> 03:46.440
It's true.

03:46.640 --> 03:47.835
Everything she said.

03:49.080 --> 03:50.480
You're a good person.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.231
It's okay. Do what you gotta do.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.000
Dex.

04:24.240 --> 04:26.072
Tell me what you saw.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.439
I don't wanna talk about it.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.109
I brought you here so we
can strip away the power

04:31.320 --> 04:32.549
this place holds.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.279
Talking's not gonna
change anything.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.314
Neither is continuing to repress
what happened here.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.999
I'm not repressing shit.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.792
And I don't need you to remind me
about what happened here.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.153
You know, Dexter's need to kill was
born in a container much like this one.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.920
And he's been trapped
inside its walls ever since.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.316
As a psychopath,
he will never break free.

04:57.560 --> 05:01.952
But you can, by reliving the events
of that night over and over.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.230
I killed him.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.960
I shot Dexter instead of LaGuerta.
That's what I saw.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.960
Unless you're gonna handcuff
me, I'd really like to go.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.351
When you shot Dexter,
how'd it make you feel?

05:13.560 --> 05:16.234
Better. Worse.
I don't fucking know.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.955
What does it even matter?
LaGuerta is still dead.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.231
What else could you have done?
Arrest him.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.193
Now your brother's on death row.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.278
We could have run.
Only to be caught.

05:26.480 --> 05:29.075
You go to jail, Dexter gets
the death penalty again.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.875
You've become obsessed
with the life you've taken.

05:32.080 --> 05:35.152
You've forgotten the life you saved.
Of course you defend him.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.592
You created him. You're using
him to track a serial killer.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.757
This isn't about Dexter
or me.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.758
This is about you getting better.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.475
Maybe I don't wanna get better.
I don't believe that.

05:45.680 --> 05:50.960
Why the fuck should I even trust you?
Why the motherfuck do you even care?

05:51.640 --> 05:52.915
Are you upset?

05:55.600 --> 05:58.035
Yes, I am.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.396
Good.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.479
At least you're no longer
avoiding your feelings.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.274
We're done for now.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.839
For today.

06:22.640 --> 06:23.960
<i>There are countless ways</i>

06:24.160 --> 06:26.755
<i>to inflict physical trauma
on the human body,</i>

06:26.960 --> 06:31.079
<i>and sometimes the deadliest wounds
are the ones we barely see.</i>

06:31.320 --> 06:33.312
<i>They run deep,</i>

06:33.520 --> 06:36.080
<i>like the ones I've inflicted on Deb.</i>

06:36.280 --> 06:37.430
What are we looking at?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.390
Well, most of the blows
are to her face.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.115
There's some bruising
around the neck.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.791
It doesn't look like
there was a struggle.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.912
No signs of a break-in.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.431
Yeah, given the lack
of defensive wounds

06:51.680 --> 06:54.991
and the close proximity
of her attacker,

06:55.200 --> 06:58.113
I'd say you're looking
for someone she knew.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.551
We have a name?
Norma Rivera.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.831
Landlord said she lived here
by herself.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.590
Got off the phone with the employer.
Housekeeper in Biscayne Bay.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.632
Nice zip code.
Yeah.

07:08.840 --> 07:12.277
Um, they said she had an ex in and
out of her life, Roberto Sagastume.

07:12.480 --> 07:16.156
Me and Miller can swing by his place.
He had a record.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.033
It's good to see you taking initiative,

07:18.200 --> 07:19.873
like any good sergeant should.

07:20.480 --> 07:21.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yo.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.519
You got my test back?

07:24.720 --> 07:25.995
You nailed it, bro.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.914
Oh.

07:28.640 --> 07:31.280
Wipe that grin off your face
before Miller sees it.

07:31.480 --> 07:36.191
Yeah, I've just never been this happy
to get back a positive test, you know?

07:36.400 --> 07:39.040
What does my sister see in you?
Before I forget

07:39.240 --> 07:41.960
there was this hottie
asking for you at the station.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.675
And you seem surprised,
why?

07:44.880 --> 07:47.759
Said she'd come by later.
They always come back for more.

07:47.960 --> 07:51.351
Hey. Any word on Deb?

07:51.560 --> 07:54.792
Yeah, Dr. Vogel says
she's still day-to-day.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.311
Let her know I was thinking about her.
I will.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.237
She's gonna be okay.

08:05.560 --> 08:09.076
<i>Opening shop. A run.</i>

08:09.360 --> 08:11.955
<i>Caffeine. All morning routines.</i>

08:12.160 --> 08:14.197
<i>But lately, mine consists
of coming here,</i>

08:14.400 --> 08:16.676
<i>waiting for the woman
I left my sister with</i>

08:16.880 --> 08:19.076
<i>to do what I couldn't,
make Deb whole again.</i>

08:19.280 --> 08:21.397
Thank you.
How is she?

08:21.640 --> 08:25.190
Well, you still remain the focal
point of your sister's pain.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.476
I wanna see her.

08:26.680 --> 08:27.830
I think it's better

08:28.000 --> 08:29.354
you keep your distance
for now.

08:29.560 --> 08:32.712
It's been almost a week.
Dexter, I am still not sure

08:32.919 --> 08:36.197
if your sister
has hit rock bottom yet.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.279
What is it?

08:42.679 --> 08:45.036
I just want you to prepare
for the possibility

08:45.240 --> 08:48.358
that Debra may never be able
to have you back in her life.

08:49.520 --> 08:50.715
No.

08:50.960 --> 08:54.397
I won't just let her go.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.957
So have you had better luck
with our killer?

09:13.720 --> 09:16.315
I crossed off three more
former patients from your book.

09:16.520 --> 09:17.840
Who's next on the list?

09:18.040 --> 09:19.110
Chapter seven.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.760
A.J. Yates.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.750
I'll check back in
once I check him out.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.959
<i>A.J. Yates.</i>

09:32.840 --> 09:35.355
<i>According to Vogel's book,
he attacked a classmate</i>

09:35.560 --> 09:37.472
<i>with a chair at 12.</i>

09:37.720 --> 09:40.679
<i>Institutionalised at 15.</i>

09:41.320 --> 09:43.994
<i>Seems Vogel tried to channel
his violent tendencies</i>

09:44.200 --> 09:45.600
<i>but he was beyond her help.</i>

09:45.800 --> 09:48.554
<i>Eventually, he was transferred
to another hospital.</i>

09:49.120 --> 09:52.192
<i>Now Yates seems to be
a productive member of society.</i>

09:52.440 --> 09:55.239
<i>He's a bundler.
Cable, phone, Internet.</i>

09:56.560 --> 09:59.837
<i>But I need to know if murder
is part of the package.</i>

10:11.720 --> 10:13.040
<i>There's nothing here.</i>

10:13.240 --> 10:16.631
<i>Nothing in Vogel's notes
about brain surgery.</i>

10:16.920 --> 10:18.434
<i>His scar.</i>

10:20.200 --> 10:22.999
<i>Is that the mark of one of her
unconventional methods?</i>

10:39.400 --> 10:42.234
Thanks for letting me use the treadmill.
Better you than me.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.113
I'm not much for running in place.

10:46.320 --> 10:49.199
Is that your shrink way
of saying that I have been?

10:49.400 --> 10:52.598
Is it? Care for some tea?

10:54.200 --> 10:56.271
How about something stronger?

10:58.320 --> 11:01.552
Come on, I just ran four miles.
What's one beer?

11:03.360 --> 11:05.875
The drinks and the drugs
were keeping you numb,

11:06.080 --> 11:08.914
making the symptoms
of your PTSD worse.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.237
Ass off the table.

11:16.520 --> 11:19.638
How long are you
expecting me to stay here?

11:21.720 --> 11:23.473
I see a lot of your father in you.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.757
Harry wrestled with the same
doubts regarding Dexter.

11:33.400 --> 11:36.040
You're not as alone
as you might think.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.637
<i>Honestly, I don't see
what the problem is.</i>

11:41.880 --> 11:44.395
<i>He had everything laid out
on his bedroom floor.</i>

11:44.640 --> 11:47.872
<i>Dexter saw in the paper how this
guy got off on a technicality</i>

11:48.080 --> 11:49.992
<i>so he was stalking him,
vetting him.</i>

11:50.200 --> 11:53.272
<i>Even found a kill room in
an abandoned house near the park.</i>

11:53.520 --> 11:54.840
<i>Just how we taught him.</i>

11:55.040 --> 11:56.554
<i>What did you tell Dexter?</i>

11:56.760 --> 11:59.480
<i>That this guy was too high-profile,
he'd be missed,</i>

11:59.680 --> 12:01.831
<i>and that Dexter
would have to wait.</i>

12:02.040 --> 12:04.191
<i>He went along with my decision.</i>

12:04.400 --> 12:05.595
<i>For now.</i>

12:06.280 --> 12:09.717
<i>Is this ever gonna be right?
What we've done?</i>

12:09.920 --> 12:14.119
<i>I mean, Dexter isn't a kid anymore.
He's becoming a man.</i>

12:14.840 --> 12:16.274
<i>He's gonna kill.</i>

12:16.480 --> 12:18.631
<i>We knew that day was coming.</i>

12:19.880 --> 12:22.520
<i>But what happens
when I finally tell him it's okay?</i>

12:23.760 --> 12:27.913
<i>When he finally knows what it's like
to take another person's life?</i>

12:28.120 --> 12:30.715
<i>The code will do
what it was designed to do.</i>

12:31.080 --> 12:33.197
<i>Allow Dexter to be
who he was meant to be.</i>

12:33.440 --> 12:34.920
<i>But what if it doesn't?</i>

12:35.120 --> 12:38.272
<i>What if the code doesn't keep him
in check? What then?</i>

12:38.520 --> 12:41.160
<i>What if this has all been
some horrible mistake?</i>

12:41.400 --> 12:43.710
Obviously, Harry
came around when he realised

12:43.920 --> 12:46.037
what else could he have done?

12:46.280 --> 12:48.875
Locked Dexter away
in an institution?

12:49.120 --> 12:51.794
Or do nothing
until he took an innocent life?

12:52.800 --> 12:55.076
Or protect your brother,

12:55.560 --> 12:57.756
giving him the tools
that he would need

12:58.000 --> 13:00.276
to channel his urges.

13:00.840 --> 13:04.800
The same way you protected
Dexter in that container.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.593
It's not the same. You're wrong.

13:06.840 --> 13:09.116
Deb.
I can't just accept it.

13:09.880 --> 13:13.510
I'm not like him. I'm not like you.

13:13.720 --> 13:17.157
Dexter-- Dex--
Dexter is fucking Dexter.

13:17.400 --> 13:21.838
Debra, Harry did not make a
mistake saving Dexter's life,

13:22.040 --> 13:23.190
and neither did you.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.959
That night
in the container

13:25.200 --> 13:27.954
Dexter was being exactly
who he was meant to be

13:28.200 --> 13:30.669
and so were you, the loving sister.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.399
I--
Will get through this.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.678
Can I keep that tape?
Yes.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.874
<i>He had everything
laid out on his bedroom floor.</i>

14:04.080 --> 14:07.471
<i>Dexter saw in the paper how this
guy got off on a technicality...</i>

14:12.600 --> 14:14.159
Dexter, you shouldn't be here.

14:14.360 --> 14:15.760
I was vetting Yates.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.196
What did you do to him?
What are you on about?

14:18.400 --> 14:20.915
He has a scar on his head
exactly where your killer

14:21.120 --> 14:23.316
has been harvesting
brain fragments.

14:23.520 --> 14:25.876
Is he another one
of your little experiments?

14:26.360 --> 14:30.195
We can talk about this, but not here.
Not with Debra in the other room.

14:35.600 --> 14:39.833
An x-ray revealed a lesion
on Yates' brain.

14:40.200 --> 14:43.159
I suspected it was contributing
to his violent behaviour,

14:43.400 --> 14:44.880
so I...

14:45.120 --> 14:47.954
I suggested the new hospital
remove it.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.629
I never knew whether
they performed the surgery.

14:50.840 --> 14:53.036
When I do what I do,
I have to know everything.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.311
Sorry for the oversight.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.510
Why don't you tell me
the real reason you're here?

14:59.720 --> 15:02.679
You could have just called
for the scar.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.278
Is it regarding what I said
about letting your sister go?

15:08.200 --> 15:10.351
Dexter, I assure you

15:10.560 --> 15:13.155
that I'm not judging
your relationship with Debra.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.080
I'm just trying to manage
your expectations.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.520
Why, because she thinks
I'm a monster?

15:20.240 --> 15:23.756
You think I don't know that I'm the one
responsible for the pain she's in?

15:23.960 --> 15:26.520
That's why she's here with you.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.473
You have to get her to forgive me.

15:28.680 --> 15:31.673
Whatever it takes, you have to
find a way. I need her in my life.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.792
You need her?
Yes.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.720
I understand that you love Debra
in your own way.

15:36.920 --> 15:40.311
In my own way.
But why do you think you need her?

15:42.680 --> 15:44.034
I just do.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.074
Deb looks up to you.
Isn't that what you said?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.070
She used to.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.959
And that made you feel good?

15:51.160 --> 15:53.550
Yes.
Well, no wonder you feel so lost.

15:53.800 --> 15:57.191
Debra became a mirror, reflecting
a positive image of yourself

15:57.400 --> 15:59.153
that you used to balance out

15:59.360 --> 16:02.114
with the notion of yourself
as a monster.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.879
Now that mirror is cracked,

16:04.080 --> 16:07.152
and the only reflection you see
is one of darkness.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.915
You make it sound like
that part of me isn't real.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.554
You are no monster.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.836
You never have been.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.396
Anyone on my table would disagree.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.877
Dexter, a monster, by definition,
is outside of nature.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.396
You're a part
of the natural order of things,

16:21.600 --> 16:24.354
with purpose and value,
a right to exist.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.200
When you accept that,
you'll no longer be dependent

16:27.400 --> 16:29.835
on Debra, or anyone's,
validation.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.554
I'll still want her in my life.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.673
Want, but not need.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.475
<i>No van. No Yates.</i>

17:15.680 --> 17:17.272
<i>No one home.</i>

17:40.960 --> 17:43.191
<i>"Monterey Nursing Home.</i>

17:44.800 --> 17:46.519
<i>Dad's 76th birthday."</i>

17:47.920 --> 17:51.311
<i>It seems Yates found a way
to keep his family in his life.</i>

17:51.520 --> 17:53.591
<i>Will I be able to do the same
with Deb?</i>

17:55.120 --> 17:57.032
<i>Vogel says I don't need her.</i>

17:58.240 --> 18:02.473
<i>But if that's true, will I be able to
let her go if that's what she needs?</i>

18:14.040 --> 18:16.350
<i>Women's shoes.</i>

18:58.120 --> 18:59.793
<i>- Hello?</i>
- It's me.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.320
I'm at Yates' house.

19:01.520 --> 19:04.479
<i>Have you found something?</i>
Women's shoes.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.320
Individual shoes, not pairs,

19:07.520 --> 19:08.749
some of them older.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.956
High heels are a far cry
from brains.

19:12.160 --> 19:14.311
It's not exactly your killer's
usual MO.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.638
<i>When this began, I expressed
my doubts that this was the work</i>

19:17.880 --> 19:19.200
<i>of someone new to killing.</i>

19:19.400 --> 19:21.710
<i>Albert wouldn't be the first
to alter his methods.</i>

19:21.920 --> 19:24.879
Yeah, still, something about
it doesn't quite add up.

19:25.080 --> 19:28.391
But just to be safe,
I'm pulling prints off the shoes.

19:28.640 --> 19:31.917
I'll run them through the station's
database for missing persons

19:32.120 --> 19:35.079
and homicide victims.
But they're only partials.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.476
I won't expect anything back
until the morning.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.792
And I have my son tonight.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.434
<i>Understood.</i>

19:41.640 --> 19:43.074
I'll let you know what I find.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.440
Vogel.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.109
She found herself a hero.

20:21.760 --> 20:22.876
Hi.

20:24.280 --> 20:27.239
Hello.
You must be Dexter. I'm Cassie, 4-B.

20:27.440 --> 20:30.399
And you're in my kitchen because?
I'm a friend of Jamie's.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.353
I ran out of detergent.
Daddy!

20:32.560 --> 20:33.835
I see you two have met.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.231
I hope you don't mind.
Who am I to deny

20:36.440 --> 20:39.114
a neighbour clean clothes?
Dinner's in the oven.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.959
I'll see you in the morning?
Sure.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.753
I'll walk you out. Mmm!

20:43.400 --> 20:45.357
Nice to meet you, Dexter.
You too.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.039
Bye.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.394
She's nice.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.917
But does she have a kissy-neck?

21:00.840 --> 21:02.797
I knew you'd pass.
I didn't.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.434
Oh, thank you for that.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.950
This one used to have
to write the combination

21:07.200 --> 21:09.715
of his locker on his wrist
when he first got here.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.197
So what? My memory sucks.
You needed the right encouragement.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.596
I don't even wanna know
what that means.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.154
We're empty.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.953
You know,
I really am so proud of you.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.073
I couldn't have
done it without you.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.839
Who was behind the wheel?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.390
Debra Morgan,
former lieutenant of Homicide,

21:28.640 --> 21:31.758
passed out, piss drunk. Ha, ha, ha!
Come on, let it go.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.673
I don't know
who was fucked up more,

21:33.880 --> 21:35.997
her or the parking metre
she ran over.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.192
Hey. How about
professional discretion?

21:38.440 --> 21:40.750
Yeah, well, I believe
that we're off the clock.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.191
But you could
lower your voice, you know?

21:43.440 --> 21:46.319
Yeah, sure. No problem.
Thanks.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.672
Who was that guy?
I don't know.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.439
He used to bone her or something.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.439
Probably the way Morgan
made lieutenant, on her back.

21:55.600 --> 21:56.636
Fuck.
Hey, hey, hey!

21:59.240 --> 22:00.640
That's enough.

22:00.880 --> 22:03.918
Enough, I said! Enough!

22:10.080 --> 22:12.356
What the hell happened?
Someone was defending

22:12.600 --> 22:15.638
his ex-girlfriend's honour.
Get him out of here.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.111
You know what? It's fine. Let's just go.
I'm sorry.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.031
Hey, how about a round
on the house?

22:25.280 --> 22:27.317
All right, lieutenant.
Fuck.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.915
So we're good?

22:35.440 --> 22:36.794
Mm.

22:42.480 --> 22:43.960
Aah!

22:45.160 --> 22:47.197
Babe. Babe, my ribs.
Yeah?

22:48.640 --> 22:50.996
I'm so sorry.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.471
How many, mister?
Two.

23:07.680 --> 23:08.955
One for me and one for Dan.

23:10.480 --> 23:13.154
Two it is.
Sorry I'm late.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.275
Who's Dan?

23:16.480 --> 23:20.030
Pet elephant. You don't see him?

23:22.360 --> 23:24.556
You want some pancakes, Dan?

23:24.760 --> 23:26.274
Eat up.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.995
Make sure Dan doesn't get
any syrup on the couch.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.759
Okay.

23:30.960 --> 23:34.670
My car died. That "check
engine" light I kept ignoring?

23:34.880 --> 23:37.634
Apparently it means what it says.
How'd you get here?

23:37.840 --> 23:41.629
Angel. But don't worry, my car will
only be in the shop for a few days.

23:41.840 --> 23:45.356
I'm gonna see if Cassie can give
us a lift to Harrison's preschool.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.232
You know, you made quite an
impression on her last night.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.433
Impression?
She's single. Just saying.

23:54.240 --> 23:58.359
Hey, why don't you take the SUV?
It's safer. I'll clear my stuff out.

23:58.560 --> 24:01.598
If you can drop me off, I'll pick
up a car from the motor pool.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.120
Sure you don't mind?

24:03.320 --> 24:05.277
I don't if Dan doesn't.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.071
How did I let you talk
me into this again?

24:24.280 --> 24:26.078
I believe your price
was one beer.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.358
So now what?
You tell me.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.711
Isn't this where you think you belong?
No.

24:32.920 --> 24:35.196
Frankly, I'm quite amazed
that you think you ever left.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.360
Are we really gonna do this?

24:37.560 --> 24:40.997
Debra, you shut yourself inside
these walls for the last six months

24:41.200 --> 24:43.237
doing your damnedest
to shut everything

24:43.440 --> 24:45.432
and everyone out.
So why don't we?

24:48.760 --> 24:50.399
What the fuck are you doing?

24:50.600 --> 24:53.195
I want you to convince
me how killing Dexter

24:53.400 --> 24:56.040
instead of LaGuerta
would be a better choice.

24:56.240 --> 24:59.039
Open the fucking door.
LaGuerta.

24:59.240 --> 25:02.039
She was on her knees,
where those blood stains are,

25:02.200 --> 25:03.236
isn't that right?

25:03.520 --> 25:05.955
She was your co-worker,
your friend.

25:06.160 --> 25:10.552
Why didn't you just stay at the party
and let Dexter take care of everything?

25:10.760 --> 25:15.391
I had to stop him.
But Dexter can't help what he is.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.911
He has no conscience,
unlike you.

25:18.160 --> 25:20.629
You knew the moment
you pointed that gun

25:20.840 --> 25:22.672
at LaGuerta it was wrong,

25:22.880 --> 25:24.997
and still, you pulled the trigger.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.476
You shot a woman in cold blood.

25:27.680 --> 25:32.516
You let her bleed out and did nothing.
You shot an innocent woman

25:32.760 --> 25:35.434
for simply doing her job.
Because of Dexter.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.472
And that's what terrifies you
the most.

25:37.840 --> 25:41.436
You so desperately want to believe
that if you had just shot Dexter,

25:41.680 --> 25:43.558
then you wouldn't have to
face the truth,

25:43.760 --> 25:45.877
that if you had to do it
all over again

25:46.080 --> 25:47.560
you'd still choose him.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.114
Because in your heart,

25:49.360 --> 25:52.751
you know you'll always
choose Dexter.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.271
How do I make it right?

26:07.680 --> 26:10.354
By finally accepting
that you're a good person

26:10.560 --> 26:13.519
who was forced to do
a terrible thing.

26:21.240 --> 26:24.916
And that you made the best
of an impossible situation.

26:27.800 --> 26:31.510
You can walk out that door.
You can move forward.

26:32.720 --> 26:36.555
The choice is yours.
It always has been.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.753
Oh, lieutenant. A word?

26:47.960 --> 26:49.394
Of course.

26:49.720 --> 26:52.599
I was just reviewing
the sergeant's exam results.

26:52.840 --> 26:55.594
And it seems you were right
and I was wrong about Quinn.

26:55.840 --> 26:58.480
Apparently, he can count
past his fingers and toes.

26:58.720 --> 27:01.519
He was in the 85th percentile.
So was Miller.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.797
In the 88th percentile, to be exact.

27:05.160 --> 27:08.392
I want you to strongly consider
making her sergeant.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.595
Angie is good. I like her, a lot.

27:11.800 --> 27:15.919
But I still think Quinn's the smarter--
All I said was "strongly consider."

27:16.120 --> 27:18.999
This is your first departmental
promotion as lieutenant

27:19.240 --> 27:22.677
and will reflect on your command.
That being said

27:22.880 --> 27:26.476
it's your decision and yours alone.

27:40.280 --> 27:43.398
<i>Three hits off
the partials, all reported missing.</i>

27:44.400 --> 27:47.120
<i>Janet Thorton, taken two weeks ago.</i>

27:47.480 --> 27:49.233
<i>Looks like Yates killed these women,</i>

27:49.480 --> 27:52.598
<i>but I still can't be sure
he's the one after Vogel.</i>

27:52.800 --> 27:54.473
<i>Not until he's on my table</i>

27:54.680 --> 27:57.479
<i>and we have a little talk first.</i>

28:07.400 --> 28:09.915
Where are we on Norma Rivera?
We're trying to find--

28:10.160 --> 28:12.277
Miller.
Address for the ex is no good.

28:12.480 --> 28:15.040
Nobody's seen him.
Got back the ME's report.

28:15.240 --> 28:18.153
They found semen.
I'm testing it to see if it's a match.

28:18.360 --> 28:21.592
Would explain why he's off the grid.
She invites him over.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.799
Things get heated, he kills her,
panics and goes on the run.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.515
That's one theory. Find this guy.
We're on it.

28:27.760 --> 28:31.151
Dex-posé. Favour. I need you
to stay away from the lab for a bit.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.829
That hottie who's been
looking for me is coming

28:34.040 --> 28:35.235
and we might need alone time.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.556
<i>No problem.</i>

28:36.760 --> 28:39.958
You would know all about that.
- You're better than that.

28:40.160 --> 28:43.836
Come on, here. There's a 20 in it
for anyone who directs her to my lab

28:44.040 --> 28:45.838
and is cool about it.
Done.

28:46.040 --> 28:47.474
Okay.

28:50.040 --> 28:53.397
<i>I'm on my own. Perfect.</i>

28:55.000 --> 28:56.354
Angel.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.591
I get it, okay?
You're pissed about last night.

28:59.840 --> 29:03.800
I had to run a tab so that asshole
patrolman wouldn't press charges.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.277
If Matthews caught wind of this,
he'd have all the ammo he needed

29:07.480 --> 29:09.995
to shoot down this promotion.
I lost my cool.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.590
I need my sergeant
to be able to keep his.

29:12.800 --> 29:13.995
A bar fight?

29:14.200 --> 29:18.353
Technically, the place is a restaurant.
It's not like you haven't done the same.

29:18.560 --> 29:22.600
You put a guy in the hospital for running
his mouth about LaGuerta using hers.

29:22.800 --> 29:25.918
Allegedly. And the difference is,
I wasn't up for promotion.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.913
I had already made sergeant.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.359
You wanna fix this?
Solve this case.

29:41.640 --> 29:44.075
Excuse me?
Are you Vincent Masuka?

29:46.720 --> 29:49.155
The one, the only.

29:49.360 --> 29:51.352
But you can call me Vince.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.599
Just as long as you call.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.560
Okay. I'm Niki.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.114
I'm a student at U of M.

29:57.320 --> 30:00.119
Oh, yeah. My alma mater. Come in.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.278
You must be majoring in

30:03.480 --> 30:04.755
beautiful.

30:09.080 --> 30:11.390
This is really hard.
I know the feeling.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.472
I think you may be my father.

30:16.320 --> 30:19.631
You were a sperm donor
in college, right?

30:20.480 --> 30:21.596
Mm-hm.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.635
But you have curls.
Yeah, my mom.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.838
Holy...

30:32.440 --> 30:35.160
Oh, fuck.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.438
This was a bad idea. Sorry.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.392
I'm sorry.
It's okay. No, don't worry.

30:44.600 --> 30:48.230
It's okay, don't-- Don't-- Don't--

30:48.440 --> 30:50.432
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.194
Oh, my God.

30:52.400 --> 30:56.280
You've got my soulful,
yet haunting eyes.

31:13.160 --> 31:15.470
Night, Marty.
See you tomorrow.

31:15.720 --> 31:17.632
We do have filing cabinets,
you know.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.673
This is kind of my process.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.190
What are you even doing here?

31:23.440 --> 31:25.352
I thought you were taking
time off.

31:25.560 --> 31:29.076
Turns out time off isn't
all it's cracked up to be. Heh.

31:29.320 --> 31:33.109
I just wanted to get a head start on
some of the cases that you left for me.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.671
Well, we're gonna need food.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.633
"We"?
Yeah, we.

31:37.840 --> 31:40.639
You look like you could use
a hand, and I'm starving.

31:46.880 --> 31:48.678
You know, when I need a break,

31:48.880 --> 31:50.712
I've got maybe two days at the most.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.434
And then I go crazy.

31:52.680 --> 31:54.876
I end up right back here.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.319
What about you?

31:58.240 --> 31:59.515
What makes you crazy?

32:02.640 --> 32:04.074
Family shit.

32:04.280 --> 32:05.396
Hm.

32:05.600 --> 32:08.160
Nothing says family like love

32:08.400 --> 32:10.039
and shit.

32:10.320 --> 32:13.040
Unfortunately, my father
was an expert in the latter.

32:13.280 --> 32:15.112
Texas oil.
Texas oil?

32:15.280 --> 32:16.316
Mm.

32:17.480 --> 32:20.120
Fuck, I hope I'm holding
my plastic fork correctly.

32:20.320 --> 32:23.518
Exactly. He was all rules,
all the time.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.357
My moving to Miami to be a cop,

32:26.560 --> 32:29.758
that was the biggest "fuck you"
I could think of at the time.

32:30.960 --> 32:34.874
When I got out of the academy,
I realised it was nothing but rules.

32:35.080 --> 32:38.391
Everybody there was like your father.
You know the worst part?

32:38.640 --> 32:42.475
I knew I'd made a huge fucking
mistake, but there was no way in hell

32:42.680 --> 32:46.037
I was gonna give him the smug
pleasure of knowing he was right.

32:46.240 --> 32:49.199
So I waited until he died,
quit the force.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.592
I opened up this place.

32:52.760 --> 32:54.991
Looks like you're doing
pretty well for yourself.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.516
Trust me,
I'm still the black sheep.

32:57.720 --> 33:01.111
The look on my mother's face every
time she goes into the country club,

33:01.320 --> 33:04.438
has to explain to one of her
friends that her son is a PI?

33:04.640 --> 33:06.359
That's gotta be
pretty close to priceless.

33:06.520 --> 33:08.034
Mm.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.796
My dad was everything to me.

33:12.280 --> 33:13.919
I loved him.

33:16.280 --> 33:19.193
And while he's
not the man I thought he was...

33:21.640 --> 33:23.279
well, I'm...

33:24.120 --> 33:27.192
I'm realising we're
more alike than I thought.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.072
To dead dads.

33:33.320 --> 33:35.516
Long may they haunt us.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.273
Heh.

33:40.960 --> 33:43.270
It's a better toast if you open it.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.112
I'm good.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.760
<i>Vogel says I'm not a monster,</i>

33:56.960 --> 33:58.792
<i>but that's exactly the part of me</i>

33:59.000 --> 34:02.311
<i>she's expecting to
remove Yates as a threat.</i>

34:08.239 --> 34:11.074
<i>A threat that seems to have
left in a hurry</i>

34:11.280 --> 34:14.114
<i>and taken all his shoes.</i>

34:28.600 --> 34:31.752
<i>Does this prove Yates
is who I'm looking for?</i>

34:33.159 --> 34:35.550
<i>The only way to know for sure is...</i>

34:38.000 --> 34:40.071
<i>find where he's hiding.</i>

35:14.440 --> 35:17.990
<i>He saw me here, heard everything.</i>

35:30.760 --> 35:33.753
<i>Bone saw. Specimen jars.</i>

35:36.920 --> 35:39.560
<i>His own cut-by-numbers guide.</i>

35:40.600 --> 35:42.080
<i>Yates is the brain surgeon.</i>

35:42.320 --> 35:44.789
<i>Vogel needs to know.</i>

36:01.040 --> 36:03.396
<i>I know her. I pulled her print.</i>

36:07.880 --> 36:09.599
<i>Yates must have stabbed her,</i>

36:09.800 --> 36:13.396
<i>nicked her left pulmonary artery,
left her for dead.</i>

36:14.320 --> 36:16.152
<i>Unaware cramming her
inside that cart</i>

36:16.400 --> 36:19.518
<i>would put pressure on the wound
and stop it from bleeding.</i>

36:20.280 --> 36:22.511
<i>Now I have to do the same.</i>

36:23.600 --> 36:25.990
<i>It'll hold, but not for long.</i>

36:29.240 --> 36:31.038
Do you think the girl will be all right?

36:31.200 --> 36:32.634
She lost a lot of blood.

36:32.840 --> 36:36.834
I stemmed the bleeding, dropped her
in the ER, got back as fast as I could.

36:37.040 --> 36:38.918
Oh, God, has he been

36:39.160 --> 36:40.310
doing all this because of me?

36:40.520 --> 36:42.079
We can't know until we find him.

36:42.280 --> 36:45.830
Let's hope there's something
on here that'll tell me how.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.799
These are patient files.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.793
Your patient files.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.151
That's not possible.

36:56.400 --> 37:00.076
This one's dated just two weeks ago.
Dexter, don't.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.559
What is this?

37:10.560 --> 37:12.119
You were keeping notes on me?

37:12.320 --> 37:14.596
It's a journal.
I've always had a journal.

37:14.800 --> 37:18.316
You were writing down everything
we did, everything we talked about.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.955
I never used your name.
Yates, nor anyone else

37:21.160 --> 37:24.597
could possibly know who you are.
"Somehow, he's deluded himself

37:24.840 --> 37:27.674
into thinking his feelings
for his sister are genuine,

37:28.480 --> 37:31.632
unaware there are no
real emotions behind them."

37:35.920 --> 37:39.038
Dexter, I-- I never meant--

37:39.240 --> 37:41.880
What am I, a subject
for another one of your books?

37:42.080 --> 37:43.878
Is that what these are for?

37:45.280 --> 37:47.556
Answer the question!

37:49.880 --> 37:53.271
My notes, it's how I process--

37:53.480 --> 37:55.836
You were experimenting
on me with Harry

37:56.080 --> 37:58.151
and you still are.

37:59.040 --> 38:02.875
I'm nothing but a lab rat,
just like Yates.

38:03.520 --> 38:05.398
That's not true. You know that.

38:05.600 --> 38:09.196
Is that why you wanna
keep me apart from Deb?

38:09.400 --> 38:11.676
Just another way to isolate
your subject,

38:11.880 --> 38:13.792
see what he'll do?

38:14.560 --> 38:16.756
Dexter...
Don't.

38:20.280 --> 38:24.160
When Yates is dead,
you are out of my life.

38:24.400 --> 38:27.677
It's over. You understand?

38:30.280 --> 38:32.749
Or do you need
to write it down?

38:34.440 --> 38:36.238
I understand.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.872
<i>I walked into the room and--</i>

39:44.080 --> 39:45.878
<i>- Go on, tell me.
- The blood.</i>

39:46.080 --> 39:48.356
<i>Evelyn, there was
so much blood, on plastic.</i>

39:48.560 --> 39:51.439
<i>Dexter had placed it everywhere.
The walls, the ceiling.</i>

39:51.640 --> 39:54.917
<i>There was a table in the middle
of the room. A table with--</i>

39:55.160 --> 39:57.675
<i>- The body?
- Parts of one.</i>

39:57.880 --> 40:00.315
<i>And when Dexter turned,
the look on his face--</i>

40:00.520 --> 40:02.113
<i>He was so proud.</i>

40:02.320 --> 40:04.960
<i>When-- The man Dexter killed,
he was a drug dealer.</i>

40:05.160 --> 40:08.198
<i>He murdered your partner.
He was going to get away with it.</i>

40:08.400 --> 40:09.754
<i>But he was a person.</i>

40:09.960 --> 40:12.555
<i>Who, according to the code,
deserved--</i>

40:12.800 --> 40:15.315
<i>No one deserves
to be in pieces.</i>

40:16.360 --> 40:17.919
<i>In bags.</i>

40:18.120 --> 40:21.636
<i>The code is a theory, an idea.</i>

40:21.840 --> 40:25.277
<i>But what I saw,
what Dexter did--</i>

40:25.520 --> 40:27.318
<i>What we did!</i>

40:36.320 --> 40:38.596
<i>I don't think I can live with this.</i>

40:46.360 --> 40:49.080
Fuck, and I'm supposed to?

41:15.160 --> 41:17.629
Hello?
<i>Mr. Yates?</i>

41:17.840 --> 41:19.399
Yeah, that's me.

41:19.600 --> 41:21.353
<i>I'm afraid we have some bad news.</i>

41:21.560 --> 41:23.517
<i>Your father's heart is failing.</i>

41:23.720 --> 41:25.040
How bad is it?

41:25.240 --> 41:28.199
You should come quickly.
He might not have much time.

41:44.640 --> 41:46.154
Dad.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.957
I got here as fast as I could.

41:49.160 --> 41:51.311
I'm right here. Can you hear me?

42:00.440 --> 42:01.476
It was you?

42:01.680 --> 42:03.558
I was counting on you
being the good son.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.918
They'll be here any second.

42:16.720 --> 42:18.552
Room 26, code blue!

42:19.280 --> 42:22.114
We're losing him. We're losing him!
<i>To save his own life,</i>

42:22.320 --> 42:24.915
<i>Yates was willing to take his father's.</i>

42:27.960 --> 42:30.759
<i>Vogel believes I'm just like
all her other experiments,</i>

42:30.960 --> 42:34.112
<i>a psychopath who can't form
real connections.</i>

42:34.360 --> 42:35.999
<i>But she's wrong.</i>

42:36.240 --> 42:39.312
<i>Deb isn't a prop, like Yates' father
was to his son.</i>

42:39.520 --> 42:43.434
<i>She's more than a mirror.
She's family.</i>

42:43.640 --> 42:47.270
<i>If I have a purpose and value
and a right to exist,</i>

42:47.480 --> 42:49.949
<i>so do my feelings for Deb.</i>

42:55.680 --> 42:58.912
<i>This experiment is over.
Vogel can go to hell.</i>

43:01.560 --> 43:03.916
Jamie packing you lunch these days?
It's for you.

43:04.120 --> 43:05.759
Just came back
from Good Samaritan.

43:05.960 --> 43:09.795
Run the blood on the clothes
of a stabbing victim, Janet Thorton.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.071
She still alive?
Still in surgery.

43:12.280 --> 43:15.034
The son of a bitch who stabbed
her broke all of her toes.

43:15.280 --> 43:18.318
How soon do you need this?
Very. On my way to the hospital

43:18.520 --> 43:22.150
to get a statement, soon as docs say
she's out of the woods. Let me know

43:22.360 --> 43:24.670
what comes back on those clothes.
Will do.

43:33.720 --> 43:35.234
Deb.

43:37.200 --> 43:38.236
What the fuck?

43:38.440 --> 43:39.874
Hey.
Hey.

43:40.080 --> 43:41.719
You here to see Dex?

43:41.920 --> 43:43.354
Yeah.

43:43.960 --> 43:46.429
Everything okay?
Because last time I saw you--

43:46.680 --> 43:48.592
Yeah, I am sorry about that.

43:48.800 --> 43:51.360
I'm so sorry I put you
in that position.

43:52.920 --> 43:54.752
Sorry I got mad at you for calling Dex.

43:54.920 --> 43:57.037
No, it's okay. You asked me not to.

43:57.280 --> 43:58.873
I was in a really bad place,

43:59.080 --> 44:03.074
but, you know, you were
just looking out for me,

44:03.320 --> 44:05.232
like you always do.

44:07.480 --> 44:10.075
Things are so easy with you.

44:10.280 --> 44:12.158
I wish it was like that
with Jamie.

44:12.360 --> 44:15.000
I just keep getting
tripped up, you know?

44:15.200 --> 44:18.352
You all all right?
Um, she's jealous.

44:18.560 --> 44:21.519
She thinks there's still
something between us.

44:24.480 --> 44:27.154
Make it work with Jamie. Heh.

44:28.160 --> 44:30.755
I want you happy.

44:33.320 --> 44:35.676
You mean so much to me, Joey.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.390
Don't you fucking forget that.

44:43.280 --> 44:44.953
Thanks.

44:47.440 --> 44:50.751
You sure you're okay?
I gotta go.

44:53.160 --> 44:55.152
Bye, Joey.

44:59.400 --> 45:00.880
<i>Deb.</i>

45:04.400 --> 45:07.632
<i>The body forms scar tissue
to close a wound.</i>

45:09.560 --> 45:12.758
<i>Has my sister begun to do the same?</i>

45:13.000 --> 45:15.469
<i>Eventually, scars fade. Who knows?</i>

45:15.680 --> 45:18.673
<i>With enough time, you may not
even remember how you got them.</i>

45:19.800 --> 45:21.393
Dex.

45:22.760 --> 45:24.672
Hey, Deb. What's up?

45:25.400 --> 45:28.677
We should talk. It's important.

45:28.880 --> 45:30.951
<i>Yates can wait. My sister can't.</i>

45:31.200 --> 45:32.793
Sure, I'd like that.

45:33.840 --> 45:35.479
Just not here.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.153
Can we take a ride?

45:49.280 --> 45:51.158
It's good to see you.

45:52.120 --> 45:54.919
Vogel said it was best
I stay away.

45:55.600 --> 45:57.512
What the fuck
does she know?

46:00.560 --> 46:03.758
If it's any comfort, we're not
on the best of terms anymore.

46:04.880 --> 46:06.792
She doesn't understand us, Dexter.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.593
Exactly.

46:10.160 --> 46:12.550
She said I might lose you,

46:12.880 --> 46:14.439
but we'll always be together, right?

46:22.000 --> 46:24.993
Vogel had these DVDs
of her and Dad.

46:26.120 --> 46:27.998
Did she ever show them to you?

46:28.200 --> 46:30.874
A couple. You?

46:33.400 --> 46:36.518
There was one that was
really interesting. It was, uh,

46:36.800 --> 46:39.554
just before Dad died.
It was his last session with her.

46:49.600 --> 46:51.353
Did Dad kill himself?

46:58.000 --> 46:59.320
Yeah.

47:00.080 --> 47:01.196
A few years back,

47:01.360 --> 47:03.158
Matthews told me the truth.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.872
Harry OD'd
on his heart medication.

47:10.560 --> 47:12.916
Was it because of you?

47:13.120 --> 47:15.680
He thought he'd created a monster.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.156
I think I know how he felt.

47:26.160 --> 47:28.356
Why he killed himself.

47:32.720 --> 47:34.313
But he only got it half right.
