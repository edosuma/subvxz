00:52.634 --> 00:54.300
MAN:
Taxi!

00:54.334 --> 00:56.567
( <i>whistling</i> )

00:56.601 --> 00:58.634
Taxi!

01:09.067 --> 01:12.367
Take this cab to Cuba.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.200
Did you hear that?

01:23.234 --> 01:26.801
I said Cuba,
like... like a hijack.

01:28.701 --> 01:31.501
God, life. I love it!

01:32.934 --> 01:34.868
Don't you love it?

01:34.901 --> 01:37.067
Don't you
love life, driver?

01:37.100 --> 01:39.267
No, we're just
good friends.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.534
Where to?

01:40.567 --> 01:42.734
Well, where do you want
to go now, Jill?

01:42.767 --> 01:44.067
You want to go
to a show?

01:44.100 --> 01:45.567
You want to go
out dancing?

01:45.601 --> 01:47.400
754 West 23rd street.

01:47.434 --> 01:50.067
Seven...
that's where you live.

01:50.100 --> 01:51.467
Yes, it is.

01:51.501 --> 01:56.601
A-ha. You mean you want
to go to... your place.

01:56.634 --> 01:58.567
Desperately.

01:58.601 --> 01:59.601
You heard her.

01:59.634 --> 02:00.968
I heard her.

02:02.434 --> 02:04.968
Oh, wasn't that
a great restaurant?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.033
Especially nice
when you can share it

02:07.067 --> 02:08.334
with someone you like.

02:08.366 --> 02:10.300
It must be.

02:10.334 --> 02:12.167
You know, uh...

02:12.200 --> 02:14.200
there are those
who claim oysters

02:14.234 --> 02:16.467
to be an aphrodisiac.

02:16.501 --> 02:17.701
Let me out here.

02:17.734 --> 02:20.234
It's not the address
you gave me.

02:20.267 --> 02:21.901
Yeah, I want to walk.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.167
I need some air.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.567
You can't get out here.

02:24.601 --> 02:26.467
This is a terrible
part of town.

02:26.501 --> 02:28.300
He's right, you know. You can
get killed in this neighborhood.

02:28.334 --> 02:30.734
Well, in that case,
let him out.

02:31.968 --> 02:35.000
Did I say something
to offend you tonight?

02:35.033 --> 02:36.234
Everything after hello.

02:36.267 --> 02:38.100
Please, Jill,

02:38.133 --> 02:39.567
the driver can hear us.

02:39.601 --> 02:40.567
No, not a word.

02:40.601 --> 02:42.200
I don't care if he can hear us.

02:42.234 --> 02:43.334
I want him to hear us.

02:43.367 --> 02:45.267
I want a witness
to what this evening

02:45.300 --> 02:47.667
was like for me
while it's still
fresh in my memory.

02:47.701 --> 02:51.601
He insisted on ordering
the meal in French.

02:51.634 --> 02:55.133
My main course
was ten pats of butter.

03:01.834 --> 03:03.968
If you were having
such a lousy time,

03:04.033 --> 03:06.167
why didn't you
say something earlier?

03:06.200 --> 03:08.000
What did you think
that I meant

03:08.033 --> 03:09.567
when I said two hours ago,

03:09.601 --> 03:12.200
"Please, for the love
of God, take me home"?

03:12.234 --> 03:15.901
I thought you were
coming on to me.

03:15.934 --> 03:18.400
Okay, here we are.

03:18.434 --> 03:20.534
Thank goodness!

03:20.567 --> 03:23.367
Uh... can I see you to the door?

03:23.400 --> 03:24.701
No.

03:24.734 --> 03:26.033
I guess this means

03:26.067 --> 03:28.267
you don't want
to sleep with me.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.901
Where to?

03:41.934 --> 03:44.300
Who cares?

03:48.133 --> 03:49.567
Hey, it's none
of my business,

03:49.601 --> 03:50.968
but if you want
my opinion,

03:51.000 --> 03:52.701
she was no great
prize, you know.

03:52.734 --> 03:53.834
With all the women
in this city,

03:53.868 --> 03:55.167
you don't have
to get hung up on her.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.634
That's easy for you to say.

03:56.667 --> 03:57.734
You're a cab driver.

03:57.767 --> 03:59.868
You have women in your cab
all day long.

03:59.901 --> 04:01.033
I never meet anybody.

04:01.067 --> 04:01.701
What do you do?

04:01.734 --> 04:03.634
I'm a United States Congressman.

04:13.467 --> 04:15.234
Say, uh, listen,
I'll just check in,

04:15.267 --> 04:17.033
and then maybe we can go
for a beer.

04:17.067 --> 04:18.200
What do you say?

04:18.233 --> 04:19.334
I'm in no hurry.

04:19.367 --> 04:20.534
Okay.

04:23.901 --> 04:25.200
Where's Louie?

04:25.234 --> 04:26.300
Oh, hi.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.133
Took his mom to the dentist.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.234
In the middle of the night?

04:29.267 --> 04:31.400
Yeah, he found
this discount dentist

04:31.434 --> 04:32.868
only works nights.

04:32.901 --> 04:34.434
Leave it to Louie, right?

04:34.467 --> 04:35.901
Yeah. Very romantic.

04:35.934 --> 04:37.701
Root canal by starlight.

04:37.734 --> 04:38.868
Hey, listen.
You want a cup of coffee?

04:38.901 --> 04:40.601
It may be a while.

04:40.634 --> 04:42.167
Oh, sure.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.400
You know, I think you're
the first congressman

04:44.434 --> 04:46.834
we've ever had
in this garage.

04:46.868 --> 04:50.133
I still don't think of myself
as a congressman.

04:50.167 --> 04:52.501
You see, Dad's
a major contributor

04:52.534 --> 04:54.501
to the party,
so, to thank him,

04:54.534 --> 04:56.968
they, uh, they ran me
for Congress.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.901
Yeah, and you won the election.
That's great.

04:58.934 --> 05:01.300
In a district
my party's always won.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.400
But you won.

05:03.434 --> 05:05.701
The week before the election

05:05.734 --> 05:08.601
my opponent
was convicted of murder.

05:08.634 --> 05:11.000
But you did win.

05:11.033 --> 05:12.634
We had to have a runoff.

05:15.634 --> 05:17.167
Yeah, so now, you're in office.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.734
I bet you're showing them, huh?

05:18.767 --> 05:20.934
There's talk
of a recall.

05:20.968 --> 05:23.067
Ah, who cares about that?

05:23.100 --> 05:24.868
You dress nice.

05:24.901 --> 05:27.033
Look, you know,
I really appreciate

05:27.067 --> 05:29.267
you trying to cheer me up
like this.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.167
( <i>laughing</i> )

05:31.200 --> 05:32.300
Hey, hey.

05:32.334 --> 05:33.701
How you doing, Alex?

05:33.734 --> 05:34.868
Guys, I'd like you to
meet Walter Griswold.

05:34.901 --> 05:37.501
Walter is a United
States Congressman.

05:37.534 --> 05:39.167
How do you do?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.968
Hey, I'm in
your district.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.100
I voted for you.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.767
Oh, yeah? Why?

05:43.801 --> 05:46.601
The other guy
was up for murder.

05:46.634 --> 05:48.834
Oh, yeah.

05:50.901 --> 05:52.334
Congressman?

05:52.367 --> 05:54.834
Yeah, Latka, this is a
very important person
in our government.

05:54.868 --> 05:56.067
Oh.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.234
No, no, Latka!

05:57.267 --> 06:00.100
You don't have
to give him money.

06:00.133 --> 06:02.868
No, no, in America, they
just like to shake hands.

06:02.901 --> 06:04.234
Oh.

06:04.267 --> 06:06.767
This is good country.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.501
Nice to meet you.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.467
It's nice to meet you.

06:10.501 --> 06:11.901
Thank you very much.

06:13.234 --> 06:16.434
( <i>growling</i> )

06:16.467 --> 06:18.100
All right, guys.

06:18.133 --> 06:21.200
Line up, animals.

06:21.234 --> 06:23.000
Hey, Louie,
how's your mom's teeth?

06:23.033 --> 06:24.367
Oh, okay.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.133
She had to have
a little work done

06:27.167 --> 06:29.601
but this guy's prices
are so reasonable

06:29.634 --> 06:31.567
I even sprung
for Novocaine.

06:31.601 --> 06:33.000
It's my own mother.

06:33.033 --> 06:34.267
What the hell?

06:34.300 --> 06:36.868
Hey, listen, Walter,
I'll be right back, okay?

06:36.901 --> 06:38.200
Okay.

06:38.234 --> 06:41.667
Hey, so what are you doing
in our garage, Your Honor?

06:41.701 --> 06:43.334
Oh, well, I was out on a date,

06:43.367 --> 06:45.734
but the lady had to
cut the evening short.

06:45.767 --> 06:48.133
Said something about
having to get up early

06:48.167 --> 06:49.734
and change her phone number.

06:49.767 --> 06:51.434
Yeah, his date was
a real sweetheart,

06:51.467 --> 06:52.868
if you know what I mean.

06:52.901 --> 06:53.968
No, Alex, it wasn't her.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.033
It was me.

06:55.067 --> 06:57.033
The fact is, uh...

06:57.067 --> 06:59.901
I'm a loser with women.

06:59.934 --> 07:01.234
Come on.

07:03.067 --> 07:04.901
Women.

07:12.234 --> 07:17.901
In my country,
women work like ox.

07:17.934 --> 07:23.133
They cook, they...
have lots of babies,

07:23.167 --> 07:26.367
uh... they get old early.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.734
They happy.

07:33.200 --> 07:37.434
In America, the women,
they have, uh...

07:37.467 --> 07:42.400
they have maids, they
dress with nice clothes,

07:42.434 --> 07:44.901
they take bubble bath.

07:44.934 --> 07:47.567
They happy.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.234
What is your point?

07:49.267 --> 07:52.567
Women happy people.

07:58.434 --> 08:01.067
Hey, Walt,
I didn't think a congressman

08:01.100 --> 08:03.767
would have any trouble
getting chicks.

08:03.801 --> 08:05.367
Oh, boy, this one does.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.634
You see,
all I ever wanted in life

08:07.667 --> 08:09.801
was a nice, sweet, average girl

08:09.834 --> 08:12.367
who couldn't keep
her hands off of me.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.801
Every time I go out,
I make a fool out of myself.

08:15.834 --> 08:18.200
It's getting so
I can't get dates.

08:18.234 --> 08:20.801
You know how embarrassing it is

08:20.834 --> 08:24.601
to go to the presidential
inaugural ball stag?

08:24.634 --> 08:27.300
I only hope
people think I'm gay.

08:27.334 --> 08:29.167
You know, Walter, I used to have
trouble with women.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.968
And then I found
that the best way to handle them

08:32.000 --> 08:33.267
was to just be myself.

08:33.299 --> 08:34.501
No, it wouldn't work for me.

08:34.534 --> 08:35.501
Why not?
You're cute.

08:35.534 --> 08:37.701
Oh, yeah.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.467
Walter, you know,
there isn't a guy here

08:39.501 --> 08:40.567
who hasn't been rejected.

08:40.601 --> 08:42.366
I mean, you're taking this
too seriously.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.634
A woman once said to me,

08:43.667 --> 08:46.300
"I never want to see you again
as long as I live."

08:46.334 --> 08:47.334
That's happened to everybody.

08:47.367 --> 08:51.133
We hadn't been introduced.

08:51.167 --> 08:53.367
He is wearing a nice suit,
though, isn't he, fellas?

08:53.400 --> 08:55.467
No, no, I might as well
just give up.

08:55.501 --> 08:56.634
Oh, Walter, baloney.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.334
You know
what your trouble is?

08:58.367 --> 09:00.100
You try too hard.

09:00.133 --> 09:01.334
You know, women sense
your anxiety.

09:01.367 --> 09:03.868
What you really need
is some confidence.

09:03.901 --> 09:06.801
I think a date
with a very attractive

09:06.834 --> 09:09.434
but a very, uh...
a very nice person

09:09.467 --> 09:11.467
would do you a lot
of good, you know that?

09:12.634 --> 09:14.334
And I have someone in mind.

09:14.367 --> 09:15.501
Her.

09:15.534 --> 09:17.133
Damn it, Louie,
you little twerp

09:17.167 --> 09:19.267
Now, listen to me.
I am not going to take

09:19.300 --> 09:21.200
that kind of garbage
from you anymore,

09:21.234 --> 09:23.133
so you can just cram it!

09:23.167 --> 09:24.567
Oh!

09:26.868 --> 09:29.601
She's uch nicer than
what I'm used to.

09:39.968 --> 09:43.467
Elaine, I want to thank you
for going out with me tonight.

09:43.501 --> 09:45.033
Did I already thank you?

09:45.067 --> 09:46.234
Yeah, you thanked me.

09:46.267 --> 09:49.234
You thanked my children,
you thanked my baby-sitter...

09:49.267 --> 09:52.100
I believe you can't say
"thank you" too often.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.534
Well, yeah, that's true.

09:53.567 --> 09:55.067
Thank you.

09:56.968 --> 09:58.033
Thank you.

09:59.968 --> 10:01.167
Thank you.

10:02.968 --> 10:05.534
I guess you can say
"thank you" too often.

10:05.567 --> 10:07.767
Walter, just relax.

10:07.801 --> 10:09.734
You saw me perspire, didn't you?

10:09.767 --> 10:10.968
Excuse me?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.400
I perspire.

10:12.434 --> 10:13.901
Well, everyone perspires.

10:13.934 --> 10:15.200
I perspire freely.

10:15.234 --> 10:16.634
I'm talking buckets.

10:16.667 --> 10:19.200
That's why
I'll never be reelected.

10:19.234 --> 10:21.300
Who's going to vote for a man

10:21.334 --> 10:25.067
who always looks like he just
stepped out of a sauna?

10:25.100 --> 10:27.300
So, what's it like
living in Washington?

10:27.334 --> 10:30.634
Oh, God,
do I sweat in Washington.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.667
It is so humid there,

10:32.701 --> 10:34.033
as if that would make
any difference.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.534
I'd probably sweat
on the Matterhorn.

10:36.567 --> 10:40.434
I shake hands with people,
and they wipe their hands off.

10:40.467 --> 10:42.667
They pretend
to do something else

10:42.701 --> 10:44.767
so they won't
hurt my feelings.

10:44.801 --> 10:47.100
They, uh...
they cross their arms.

10:47.133 --> 10:50.200
They adjust their ties.

10:50.234 --> 10:52.100
They wave hello at friends.

10:52.133 --> 10:54.167
Could we talk about
something else?

10:54.200 --> 10:56.167
I'm talking
about sweat again.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.634
Why do I always
talk sweat on dates?

10:58.667 --> 11:01.534
It's because
I'm always sweating on dates.

11:02.567 --> 11:04.734
I was the only one who said no.

11:04.767 --> 11:06.200
Oh, hey, Walter!

11:06.234 --> 11:08.434
Nice to see you again.

11:08.467 --> 11:09.868
Hi, Elaine.

11:09.901 --> 11:12.033
Hi.

11:12.067 --> 11:14.868
Hey, you guys come here
all the time, right?

11:14.901 --> 11:16.868
You got anything
to recommend

11:16.901 --> 11:19.334
to make the dining experience
a memorable one?

11:19.367 --> 11:22.501
Yeah, they got a great air
hockey game in the back room.

11:22.534 --> 11:23.634
Hey, come on.
They do.

11:23.667 --> 11:25.033
I know.
Uh, we'll see you later.

11:25.067 --> 11:27.567
Would you care
for another round?

11:27.601 --> 11:28.934
Oh, no, I'm fine.

11:28.968 --> 11:30.701
Uh, I'll have another.

11:30.734 --> 11:31.901
He hates me.

11:31.934 --> 11:33.534
Who?

11:33.567 --> 11:34.868
The waiter.

11:34.901 --> 11:36.934
I know when a man despises me

11:36.968 --> 11:38.901
and that man despises me.

11:38.934 --> 11:42.234
He's going to spit in my food.

11:44.067 --> 11:46.000
They do that.

11:46.033 --> 11:47.968
Could we go back to sweating?

11:50.267 --> 11:52.801
Well, well, well.

11:52.834 --> 11:53.968
Look who's here.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.400
Hi, Louie.

11:55.434 --> 11:56.667
Hello, Nardo.

11:56.701 --> 11:59.501
Is this your date
for the evening?

11:59.534 --> 12:01.334
You remember me, Congressman
Walter Griswold.

12:01.367 --> 12:02.868
Yeah.

12:02.901 --> 12:06.701
What, they run out of towels
in the men's room?

12:06.734 --> 12:09.400
No, that's, uh,
that's sweat.

12:09.434 --> 12:12.834
I was telling Elaine,
I sweat a lot.

12:12.868 --> 12:16.033
Congratulations.

12:16.067 --> 12:18.234
Well, uh, I don't want

12:18.267 --> 12:21.834
to destroy
your magical tete-a-tete.

12:21.868 --> 12:23.300
See you later.

12:23.334 --> 12:24.834
He's a nice guy.

12:24.868 --> 12:26.234
Oh, yeah, a prince.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.868
Talk about a lame duck.

12:28.901 --> 12:30.267
( <i>laughing</i> )

12:30.300 --> 12:31.734
Hey, come on, Louie.

12:31.767 --> 12:33.200
Walter's a nice guy.

12:33.234 --> 12:35.534
He's a United States
Congressman.

12:35.567 --> 12:38.501
I don't care if he's
the Duke of Cornwall.

12:38.534 --> 12:40.934
In my book,
the guy's a <i>shlimazl.</i>

12:40.968 --> 12:42.934
What's a <i>shlimazl?</i>

12:45.567 --> 12:47.968
Well, you see,
there's <i>schlemiels</i>

12:48.000 --> 12:50.667
and <i>shlimazls.</i>

12:51.601 --> 12:53.033
A <i>schlemiel</i> is a guy

12:53.067 --> 12:55.501
who goes to
a formal dinner party

12:55.534 --> 12:57.067
and spills his soup.

12:57.100 --> 13:00.133
A <i>shlimazl's</i>
the guy he spills it on.

13:01.601 --> 13:03.834
Hey, Louie, you know
what's good about you?

13:03.868 --> 13:04.968
What?

13:05.033 --> 13:08.234
I was hoping
you had an answer.

13:08.267 --> 13:11.300
Have, uh, have you
decided yet, Elaine?

13:11.334 --> 13:14.667
Um... I'm not sure.

13:14.701 --> 13:17.000
Walter, your
menu's on fire.

13:17.033 --> 13:18.868
Walter, uh...

13:49.000 --> 13:52.901
I think I'll start
with the chocolate cheesecake.

13:56.033 --> 13:58.901
Boy, this guy.

13:58.934 --> 14:01.234
He is a horse's <i>yatabe.</i>

14:10.567 --> 14:12.267
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry,
Elaine.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.901
It's the same old story.

14:13.934 --> 14:16.968
A girl goes out with me,
I embarrass her.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.100
It's no wonder they never want
to see me again.

14:20.133 --> 14:22.033
I never want
to see me again.

14:22.067 --> 14:23.634
I didn't say
I didn't want to see you again.

14:23.667 --> 14:25.701
Oh, yeah? You want to go out
Saturday night?

14:25.734 --> 14:27.467
Oh, no,
Saturday, I made these...

14:27.501 --> 14:29.467
See? See?
What about Sunday?

14:29.501 --> 14:30.868
No, I take the kids...

14:30.901 --> 14:32.033
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

14:32.067 --> 14:33.200
What about Monday?

14:33.234 --> 14:34.634
Monday's a bad day.

14:34.667 --> 14:35.534
Mm-hmm. Tuesday?

14:35.567 --> 14:38.400
Well... it's fine.

14:38.434 --> 14:41.067
What?

14:41.100 --> 14:42.901
I'd love to.

14:42.934 --> 14:44.334
You want to go out
with me again?

14:45.634 --> 14:46.634
Yes, Walter.

14:49.033 --> 14:51.033
What's wrong with you?

14:59.434 --> 15:00.501
Can you believe Elaine?

15:00.534 --> 15:02.434
Getting mixed up
with a loser like that?

15:02.467 --> 15:05.300
She's gone out with him every
night for the past two weeks.

15:05.334 --> 15:07.734
Look, Why do we have to
talk about Walter anymore?

15:07.767 --> 15:09.834
We all have our good
days and our bad days.

15:09.868 --> 15:13.200
Then Walter's got
some great days ahead.

15:13.234 --> 15:14.934
What are you guys
talking about?

15:14.968 --> 15:16.033
Boxing.Work.
School.

15:16.067 --> 15:17.033
General stuff.

15:17.067 --> 15:20.067
Must have been a hell
of a conversation.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.467
Well, Nardo...

15:21.501 --> 15:23.200
Has it happened yet?

15:23.234 --> 15:24.534
What?

15:24.567 --> 15:26.033
Has one of your kisses

15:26.067 --> 15:28.033
turned the toad
into a prince?

15:28.067 --> 15:29.801
Louie, you take that back.

15:29.834 --> 15:33.167
Nardo, do you know
what a <i>shlimazl</i> is?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.434
I don't have
to listen to this.

15:35.467 --> 15:38.634
A <i>sclimazl</i> is a guy
who comes home from work early

15:38.667 --> 15:41.033
and finds his wife
in bed with his boss,

15:41.067 --> 15:44.267
then gets docked a day's pay
for leaving the office.

15:44.300 --> 15:45.601
( <i>laughs</i> )

15:45.634 --> 15:47.601
And with
a little more class,

15:47.634 --> 15:49.601
Walter would be
a <i>shlimazl.</i>

15:49.634 --> 15:50.634
( <i>cackling</i> )

15:50.667 --> 15:52.267
Louie, I am warning you.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.534
Now watch it.

15:53.567 --> 15:55.133
( <i>laughing</i> )

15:55.167 --> 15:57.767
( <i>yells</i> )

15:57.801 --> 16:01.567
Listen, Nardo...
if you ever grab me again

16:01.601 --> 16:04.934
in a non-erogenous zone,
you're gone.

16:04.968 --> 16:05.968
Ugh.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.834
Alex, I need
your advice.

16:11.868 --> 16:14.667
ALL:
Ooh!

16:14.701 --> 16:16.634
What? Okay, look,

16:16.667 --> 16:17.868
unless it's about you
and Walter,

16:17.901 --> 16:19.767
because I don't want to get
in the middle of that.

16:19.801 --> 16:20.934
It's about me and Walter.

16:20.968 --> 16:23.501
All right. If you just want to
talk and it's no big stuff...

16:23.534 --> 16:24.567
It's gigantic stuff.

16:24.601 --> 16:26.534
Well, I mean, if it doesn't get
really intimate...

16:26.567 --> 16:27.601
You can't get
more intimate.

16:27.634 --> 16:28.634
In that case, shoot.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.000
Well... I guess
everybody's really curious

16:33.033 --> 16:35.267
about why I'm seeing him
so much.

16:35.300 --> 16:36.968
Well, I'm not. I understand.

16:37.000 --> 16:37.968
Yeah?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.167
Yeah.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.767
I mean, he's not the man of
my dreams, but I like him.

16:42.801 --> 16:45.067
I guess like him for
the same reason

16:45.100 --> 16:48.434
I'm drawn to that scrawny
little puppy in the pet store

16:48.467 --> 16:49.901
you know, that
nobody else wants.

16:49.934 --> 16:50.934
Well, whatever your reasons,

16:50.968 --> 16:52.767
I really got to hand it to you,
Elaine, you know?

16:52.801 --> 16:55.000
Dating you
has really changed Walter.

16:55.033 --> 16:56.367
He seems like he's got

16:56.400 --> 16:57.968
a lot more confidence
in himself now.

16:58.033 --> 16:58.667
You know that?

16:58.701 --> 17:00.067
I know. You're right.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.501
Oh, he is such a sweet guy.

17:01.534 --> 17:04.300
You know how some guys
treat your kids nice?

17:04.334 --> 17:05.467
Yeah.

17:05.501 --> 17:07.834
Well, Walter's not just
treating them nice.

17:07.867 --> 17:09.434
I mean, he really likes my kids.

17:09.467 --> 17:10.367
Oh, yeah?

17:10.400 --> 17:12.300
The other day
my daughter came home upset

17:12.334 --> 17:13.968
because three
of her best friends

17:14.000 --> 17:16.267
were going to see
 <i>The Nutcracker</i> without her.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.233
The mother couldn't get
an extra ticket

17:18.267 --> 17:19.901
and so she was the only one
left out.

17:19.934 --> 17:22.133
Well, I'm giving her
this big lecture,

17:22.166 --> 17:23.867
telling her it's no big deal

17:23.901 --> 17:26.133
and you shouldn't be
so upset about it,

17:26.166 --> 17:27.901
you know, but she
wouldn't stop crying.

17:27.934 --> 17:31.300
So I look over at Walter,
and he's got tears in his eyes.

17:31.334 --> 17:33.501
So then I got them both
on my hands.

17:33.534 --> 17:34.634
So, what'd you do?

17:34.667 --> 17:37.901
I took them both
to see <i>The Nutcracker.</i>

17:37.934 --> 17:38.801
What's your problem?

17:38.834 --> 17:39.834
I got to break up with him.

17:39.868 --> 17:41.667
Oh, Elaine, no.

17:41.701 --> 17:44.334
I know, Alex.
I'm sorry, but
I have no choice.

17:44.367 --> 17:47.133
Walter's beginning to make
certain suggestions.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.167
Like what?

17:48.200 --> 17:50.234
Like, "How about
a roll in the hay?"

17:50.267 --> 17:54.334
Walter's suggestions seem to run
toward the blunt, don't they?

17:54.367 --> 17:55.334
Yeah.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.667
I mean, I like him,

17:56.701 --> 17:59.467
but there's just not
that chemistry thing.

17:59.501 --> 18:01.701
So what do you want me to say,
I understand?

18:01.734 --> 18:02.701
I understand.

18:02.734 --> 18:04.634
What are you getting
so sore about?

18:04.667 --> 18:05.667
I'm not sore.

18:05.701 --> 18:06.801
I mean, you want advice?

18:06.834 --> 18:09.133
You want to break up
with Walter, fine.

18:09.167 --> 18:10.734
Just go on your own instincts,

18:10.767 --> 18:13.934
those same instincts
that have gotten you this far--

18:13.968 --> 18:15.701
divorced, poor,
working nights,

18:15.734 --> 18:16.767
holding two jobs.

18:16.801 --> 18:18.334
Alex, will you calm down
for a second?

18:18.367 --> 18:19.167
Now listen to me.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.767
This man is
coming over tonight.

18:20.801 --> 18:22.167
We're gonna be alone.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.734
My kids are with my ex-husband.

18:24.767 --> 18:27.067
I don't know if I can
handle this.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.701
Elaine, do you really expect me
to tell you

18:28.734 --> 18:30.767
whether you should roll
in the hay or not with Walter?

18:30.801 --> 18:33.033
I guess you're right.

18:33.067 --> 18:35.734
Oh, I got to do
what I got to do.

18:35.767 --> 18:38.868
I just know it's going
to break his heart.

18:38.901 --> 18:41.834
Oh. You're going
to go to bed with him.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.300
You're sure
you don't want anything?

19:00.300 --> 19:03.968
Maybe just a little... applause.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
No, I haven't got time.

19:09.033 --> 19:11.601
I'll just have
a cup of coffee...

19:11.634 --> 19:13.901
Babe.

19:29.467 --> 19:31.934
Uh...

19:31.968 --> 19:33.467
Say, can we talk about...

19:33.501 --> 19:35.033
No, no.

19:35.067 --> 19:36.467
I guess we shouldn't.

19:36.501 --> 19:38.434
It's not a thing
you talk about.

19:38.467 --> 19:40.634
Walter, it's okay
to talk about it.

19:40.667 --> 19:43.334
I've never sweat so much
in my entire life.

19:46.467 --> 19:47.801
Elaine, be honest with me.

19:47.834 --> 19:50.834
Did you let me stay last night
because you wanted to,

19:50.868 --> 19:52.767
or because you felt sorry
for me?

19:52.801 --> 19:55.601
Or did I just catch up
with the law of averages?

19:55.634 --> 19:59.434
Walter, I let you stay
because I care about you.

19:59.467 --> 20:00.501
Isn't that reason enough?

20:00.534 --> 20:01.634
Yeah.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.868
Elaine, I had a little time
to think

20:03.901 --> 20:06.033
before you woke up
this morning...

20:06.067 --> 20:08.133
seven, eight hours...

20:10.601 --> 20:12.300
I have a great idea.

20:12.334 --> 20:15.033
Why don't you and I agree
not to see anyone else.

20:15.067 --> 20:16.300
Walter...

20:16.334 --> 20:19.834
Okay, okay, I'll just agree
not to see anyone else,

20:19.868 --> 20:22.033
but when
can I see you again?

20:22.067 --> 20:23.367
What do you mean?

20:23.400 --> 20:24.834
Well, now that
we've done this,

20:24.868 --> 20:26.834
I want to know
when I can see you

20:26.868 --> 20:27.934
and for how long,

20:27.968 --> 20:30.000
and can you write this
down for me?

20:30.033 --> 20:31.300
Walter, listen to me.

20:31.334 --> 20:32.734
This was just what
I was afraid of.

20:32.767 --> 20:34.734
I pushed too far, right?

20:34.767 --> 20:35.400
Well...

20:35.434 --> 20:36.868
All right, all right.

20:36.901 --> 20:38.367
Don't worry about that,
don't worry about that.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.701
We don't have to go
steady or anything

20:40.734 --> 20:43.634
but I'd appreciate it
if you'd meet my parents.

20:43.667 --> 20:44.634
Walter...

20:44.667 --> 20:46.033
I can make a call now.

20:46.067 --> 20:48.234
There are flights
leaving all hours.

20:48.267 --> 20:50.534
Walter, you want to fly your
parents to New York

20:50.567 --> 20:51.868
because of what we
did last night?

20:51.901 --> 20:53.334
It's a shuttle.

20:53.367 --> 20:55.234
It'll be great.

20:55.267 --> 20:56.701
You'll bring the kids

20:56.734 --> 20:59.400
and we'll go and see
 <i>The Nutcracker.</i>

20:59.434 --> 21:00.734
Walter!

21:00.767 --> 21:01.834
I'm screwing up.

21:01.868 --> 21:03.400
I'm screwing up.

21:03.434 --> 21:04.734
Walter, now, stop.

21:04.767 --> 21:06.033
Just listen to me.

21:06.067 --> 21:07.334
It's too much.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.000
You're scaring me.

21:09.033 --> 21:10.267
You're trying to chart

21:10.300 --> 21:12.501
our entire relationship
in one morning.

21:12.534 --> 21:14.200
You're right.

21:14.234 --> 21:15.667
You're absolutely right.

21:15.701 --> 21:18.067
I tend to make too much
of these things.

21:18.100 --> 21:20.801
Oh, forgive me, Elaine.

21:24.601 --> 21:28.200
It was a wonderful evening.

21:39.868 --> 21:42.934
Maybe we'll see
each other again.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.767
Good-bye, Elaine.

22:24.467 --> 22:28.300
Were you missing me at all,
because I was dying out there.

22:28.334 --> 22:32.033
You are such a lovely man.

22:32.067 --> 22:34.801
Hey, I want our relationship
to continue.

22:34.834 --> 22:36.934
Can't we just
leave it at that?

22:36.968 --> 22:38.501
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

22:38.534 --> 22:40.367
We should just take it slow.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.501
Take it as it comes.

22:42.534 --> 22:43.834
Right.

22:43.868 --> 22:45.200
Play it by ear.

22:45.234 --> 22:47.801
How about every Thursday night
for the next three months?

22:49.634 --> 22:51.133
Is 8:00 okay?

23:04.767 --> 23:06.701
See? I told you
we'd make it.

23:06.734 --> 23:09.000
Hey, listen, you've
got 15 minutes

23:09.033 --> 23:10.901
before your plane
takes off.

23:10.934 --> 23:12.334
Good.

23:12.367 --> 23:15.767
So, how'd it go with you
and Elaine last night?

23:15.801 --> 23:16.634
Fine.

23:16.667 --> 23:18.601
Oh, that's good.

23:18.634 --> 23:20.968
Yes, fine is very good.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.267
You do anything
out of the ordinary?

23:23.300 --> 23:28.267
No. It was, I guess, an ordinary
evening for most people.

23:28.300 --> 23:29.300
Now listen, Alex.

23:29.334 --> 23:30.734
I know you want to know

23:30.767 --> 23:33.534
what took place
between Elaine and me,

23:33.567 --> 23:37.234
but there are some things
a gentleman does not discuss.

23:37.267 --> 23:38.834
Oh, I understand,
Walter.

23:38.868 --> 23:42.000
I'll probably see you
next time I'm back in town.

23:42.033 --> 23:43.734
Yeah, I'll see you,
Walter.

23:43.767 --> 23:45.000
Oh, and Walter...

23:45.033 --> 23:46.133
Yeah?

23:46.167 --> 23:48.133
Congratulations.

23:48.167 --> 23:49.501
Thanks.
