WEBVTT

00:07.074 --> 00:12.745
(birds chirping)

00:25.760 --> 00:28.060
(growl)

00:33.700 --> 00:35.567
CHRIS: Holy (bleep).

00:41.175 --> 00:42.741
CHRIS: Sign or anything.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.881
CHRIS: Wow, alright. Okay.

01:05.866 --> 01:06.899
(shotgun blast)

01:13.808 --> 01:16.208
CHRIS: (bleep)!

01:22.349 --> 01:24.583
(shotgun blast)

01:29.890 --> 01:32.691
I didn't expect that.

01:33.494 --> 01:39.198
Holy (bleep).
I'm sorry, buddy.

01:41.302 --> 01:44.770
JESSI: I thought it was the
wind opening the bath house.

01:44.838 --> 01:48.373
But it wasn't, I looked
outside that window and I just

01:48.375 --> 01:49.975
saw this bear like,

01:49.977 --> 01:52.377
standing up at our front door.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.647
CHRIS: It's hard to see but
right here is a bear paw print

01:57.451 --> 02:01.520
where he actually placed his
hand up here and was pulling

02:01.588 --> 02:04.890
with his other hand on the
door and was opening and

02:04.909 --> 02:07.860
closing the door to our house.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.796
We thought it was the dog,
but then we looked over and

02:10.864 --> 02:12.564
saw the dog.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.402
JESSI: And saw the
bear opening our door.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.171
You could see him right
through the window.

02:19.873 --> 02:22.074
(Chris sighs)

02:28.549 --> 02:29.814
CHRIS: Well, now
that the bear's down,

02:29.817 --> 02:31.984
work's just starting.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.752
It's starting to get warm,

02:33.820 --> 02:35.020
we gotta take
care of this animal,

02:35.088 --> 02:37.355
we don't want flies to cover it.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.491
This bear didn't come
here and give his life to me

02:39.493 --> 02:41.092
so I would be wasteful.

02:41.095 --> 02:42.494
We're gonna do
everything in our power to

02:42.496 --> 02:43.695
preserve this meat.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.165
All of the fur and all of
the claws and probably even

02:46.233 --> 02:48.901
the teeth; every bit of
this bear is gonna be used.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.037
I feel like if you're out here
and you're given a gift like

02:52.039 --> 02:54.439
this and you let it go to
waste, The Cosna will know,

02:54.508 --> 02:56.675
and it will punish you.

03:01.448 --> 03:02.781
What a day.

03:06.386 --> 03:07.586
BRITTANY: Living in Alaska,

03:07.654 --> 03:09.188
regardless of what
the weather is doing,

03:09.256 --> 03:10.855
we have to prepare.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.057
We have to build,

03:12.059 --> 03:13.992
we have to get
these things done.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.895
Especially when our
seasons are so short.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.366
BRITTANY: It's just another
weird year in Alaska.

03:24.405 --> 03:27.806
Okay, okay.
So, we wanna be calm.

03:29.409 --> 03:31.476
Oh man, we need our coop.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.144
Seriously.

03:33.147 --> 03:36.014
Daddy's outside with
the excavator making space

03:36.016 --> 03:37.749
for our new coop.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.417
And I think it is
none too early.

03:39.420 --> 03:43.956
These girls are about ready
to outgrow this pen here.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.225
Kaleb and I have decided
to raise chickens for

03:46.293 --> 03:48.293
both meat and for eggs.

03:48.295 --> 03:50.895
The chickens inside the
house are starting to stink;

03:50.898 --> 03:54.032
they are definitely ready
to go into their big coop.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.902
They are just making a mess,
we have to change out their

03:56.970 --> 04:00.572
pens so often because they
just poop all over the place.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.708
They need more space.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.143
GILBERT: Mom, look
at this little one.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.511
BRITTANY: Yeah.

04:06.513 --> 04:07.979
Is it taking a nice
little rest with you?

04:07.982 --> 04:10.582
GILBERT: No.
It just laying down.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.517
BRITTANY: Alright, Gilbert.
Let's go and help daddy.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.589
KALEB: Today Brittany and
I are planning on building

04:17.591 --> 04:19.024
a chicken coop.

04:20.327 --> 04:24.062
She has plans to grow quite
a few meat birds this year.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.300
And we also want fresh eggs.

04:30.537 --> 04:31.803
BRITTANY: Hey.
KALEB: Hey.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.071
BRITTANY: Looks great.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.140
KALEB: Yeah, so where do you
want this chicken coop to go?

04:35.208 --> 04:37.676
BRITTANY: We need a
30 by 10 space, essentially.

04:37.678 --> 04:40.612
KALEB: Okay, our chicken coop
will start right here,

04:40.681 --> 04:42.014
just like that.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.383
Okay, now we gotta mark our
center because we're gonna,

04:44.401 --> 04:46.818
we're gonna have a center
support on our floor.

04:47.021 --> 04:48.620
BRITTANY: Okay.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.023
KALEB: So, we're just getting
rough measurements here now,

04:51.091 --> 04:52.991
so I have somewhere to dig.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.492
BRITTANY: Okay.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.295
Alright what do we
need to do next?

04:56.363 --> 04:58.530
KALEB: I need to
start moving rocks.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.904
I'm using rocks for my
foundation for this building

05:06.307 --> 05:08.774
because concrete is
really expensive out here.

05:08.842 --> 05:12.244
It's $400 a yard and a
week of cure time before you

05:12.312 --> 05:14.479
can put any weight on it.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.184
BRITTANY: Springtime out
here varies every year.

05:19.186 --> 05:22.387
Sometimes we don't have snow
at this point and other years

05:22.456 --> 05:24.856
we're still getting snow.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.592
We have a small window in
Alaska to get s these building

05:27.661 --> 05:30.128
projects done, so we have
to get this done now.

05:31.398 --> 05:35.066
Most of what we do today
impacts us more in two or

05:35.069 --> 05:37.769
three months then
it does right now.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.774
Oh, here comes the jackhammer.

05:44.144 --> 05:47.012
(jackhammer motor)

05:50.751 --> 05:52.584
GILBERT: That is super loud.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.165
BRITTANY: See how this looks.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.568
KALEB: Alright, this thing
just goes on here like this,

06:10.838 --> 06:13.638
screw it on.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.840
BRITTANY: Nice.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.708
KALEB: And then we hang our,
we hang our floor right here,

06:16.710 --> 06:19.444
so we'll have one at
all six of these, uh,

06:19.446 --> 06:20.645
foundation posts.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.913
BRITTANY: Cool.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.181
KALEB: I think
it's gonna work.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.183
BRITTANY: Cool, well let's
get started on the rest.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.851
One down, five to go.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.920
KALEB: Five to go.

06:30.991 --> 06:34.192
JOHNNY: I enjoy labor,
I enjoy hard work.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.393
Living in Alaska,

06:35.396 --> 06:37.128
living this lifestyle
I'm able to just come out

06:37.131 --> 06:38.263
onto my land.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.899
Build whatever I want and
see the fruits of my labor.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.478
JOHNNY: Alright.

06:53.547 --> 06:58.216
Got all the timber here
to make the garden boxes.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.485
And this is where
they're all gonna live,

07:00.554 --> 07:03.188
I'm gonna have 'em all set up.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.358
But before I can set them up,

07:06.426 --> 07:10.095
I'm going to clear out all
this brush and have like a nice,

07:10.163 --> 07:13.498
level area to work with.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.834
Get all these weeds out of here,

07:15.836 --> 07:18.170
should be able to
shape up this land.

07:19.573 --> 07:22.707
The Brooks Range is where
I spend the winter,

07:22.776 --> 07:25.777
then come back down to
Fritz Creek in the spring

07:25.779 --> 07:27.312
and in the summer.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.781
In Alaska, I have a short
but sweet growing period.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.716
It's a small window of time,

07:31.785 --> 07:35.654
but during that window
of time I get a lot of sun.

07:35.922 --> 07:38.389
So, I'm gonna capitalize on
this opportunity to get a

07:38.392 --> 07:41.259
garden in the ground,
start raising some produce.

07:41.328 --> 07:44.162
Which is gonna kinda carry
me through the summer.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.868
Looking pretty good.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.839
Think I could fit four of
those garden boxes in here.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.545
I'm gonna try to level
it out with this pickaxe.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.220
(chopping)

08:08.288 --> 08:11.022
Just kinda get some of
these lumps and clumps out

08:11.024 --> 08:13.424
so the logs can lay flat,

08:13.427 --> 08:15.794
and the beds can
be nice and even.

08:17.498 --> 08:20.398
Think that'll do, so I'm
gonna grab the longer ones,

08:21.568 --> 08:24.035
put 'em on this side 'cause
I kinda have a little bit

08:24.104 --> 08:27.506
more room and my space kinda
narrows as it goes back so.

08:27.574 --> 08:31.243
It's a little late in
the year and that's not

08:31.311 --> 08:33.979
a laziness it's just
a lack of time.

08:34.047 --> 08:37.182
Start right here, first log.

08:37.985 --> 08:42.120
There is just always a lot
to do when I get to each camp

08:42.188 --> 08:44.522
before I can actually
settle down and move on

08:44.525 --> 08:46.791
with new projects.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.396
And Alaska has a very
short growing season.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.865
So, it's kind of a
one-shot opportunity.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.402
I needed to act
now and move fast.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.003
So, the boxes are complete,

08:59.006 --> 09:00.872
I need to get out there
toward the beach and

09:00.941 --> 09:02.541
start bringing
in some material...

09:02.609 --> 09:03.541
Cool.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.110
To fill these boxes.

09:06.313 --> 09:09.681
CHEVIE: Being taught
and raised in Alaska

09:09.683 --> 09:13.151
by generations of
Alaskans before me.

09:13.353 --> 09:17.022
There's some responsibility
and obligation to be able to

09:17.090 --> 09:18.990
pass that down to my kids.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.094
It's how I put my stamp on
Alaska forever, I guess.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.498
Alright, Sydney.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.433
We're gonna try to get
you a beaver, here.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.901
We'll see if we can get lucky,

09:29.970 --> 09:32.037
you never know what we'll get.

09:35.642 --> 09:37.576
So, just kinda watch
along the edges,

09:37.644 --> 09:40.045
too 'cause they swim
right on the edge.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.980
Spring time's kind of
an important time to me.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.982
There's a lot of animals
coming alive and moving and

09:43.984 --> 09:46.451
it's kind of the last time
before getting into summertime

09:46.453 --> 09:47.986
where we don't
hunt a whole bunch,

09:48.054 --> 09:50.521
so it's a necessity to get
out and capitalize in this

09:50.524 --> 09:52.390
time of year.

09:55.929 --> 09:59.464
Can you smell that?

09:59.666 --> 10:02.200
That's sweet, that sweet
kind of musty smell?

10:02.469 --> 10:04.402
SYDNEY: Yeah.
CHEVIE: That's beaver caster.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.004
That's beaver.

10:06.072 --> 10:07.205
SYDNEY: Where is it?

10:07.207 --> 10:08.806
CHEVIE: It was just
right here, I seen its wake,

10:08.809 --> 10:10.075
I didn't, I smelled it,

10:10.143 --> 10:11.943
I kinda smelled it first
but then I just happened to

10:12.012 --> 10:13.812
look over there and I think
it was just sitting right here.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.431
Let's just sit right here and
watch just for a second, okay?

10:16.483 --> 10:17.682
SYDNEY: Okay,
I don't see anything.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.951
CHEVIE: While the
motors not on.

10:20.153 --> 10:23.554
So, Sydney's ready for this because
she's mature enough to follow directions,

10:23.557 --> 10:25.223
she's old enough
where she can withstand

10:25.291 --> 10:27.892
a little bit of the cold
and the long days.

10:27.894 --> 10:30.762
She has the patience
to be able to do it.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.431
It's okay to stand up
and look around too, honey.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.432
Okay?

10:34.434 --> 10:35.767
When we're stopped the
boat's stopped and now,

10:35.769 --> 10:38.236
you're hunting, okay?

10:38.705 --> 10:40.805
So, what I like to
do too is I grab my...

10:40.841 --> 10:42.107
SYDNEY: Gun?

10:42.175 --> 10:46.711
CHEVIE: My gun here,
and I'll just look.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.651
CHEVIE: Uh-hmm.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.526
CHEVIE: That eagle is sure
making a lot of noise, isn't it?

11:04.598 --> 11:06.197
CHEVIE: Geez, it's
nice to be out huh?

11:06.199 --> 11:07.332
SYDNEY: Uh-huh.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.068
CHEVIE: Just part of doing
anything is patience, you know?

11:10.603 --> 11:13.738
Just wait and wait and
wait and they'll come back up.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.840
And if they don't, we
can move a little bit.

11:23.417 --> 11:24.615
CHEVIE: Is that that
beaver sitting right there?

11:24.618 --> 11:26.151
Look at it right there sitting
right there, eating that.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.285
It's out of the water,
right there.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.420
You see it baby?

11:33.694 --> 11:35.694
CHEVIE: So always wanna
shoot 'em in the head, okay?

11:40.500 --> 11:41.699
(gunshot)

11:41.702 --> 11:43.334
That's how you do it, alright.

11:54.581 --> 11:55.580
(gunshot)

11:55.648 --> 11:57.115
SYDNEY: Let's go to it!
Let's go to it!

11:58.785 --> 12:00.018
CHEVIE: Be calm, okay?

12:01.921 --> 12:03.254
CHEVIE: Never get
excited, you gotta,

12:03.323 --> 12:06.725
you gotta know what
you're doing but,

12:07.994 --> 12:09.861
you can only go so fast, okay?

12:15.936 --> 12:18.669
CHEVIE: No, it's
around here somewhere.

12:18.672 --> 12:21.072
Just have to look here
and see if it comes up.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.908
SYDNEY: I think
Thor smells it.

12:30.817 --> 12:35.720
CHEVIE: Sometimes they'll die when
you get 'em hit like that and then they'll,

12:36.823 --> 12:38.623
once they fill up
with a little bit of

12:38.691 --> 12:40.291
air they'll come back up.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.096
CHEVIE: Well, after they die
their bodies will kinda fill

12:45.165 --> 12:47.715
up with a little bit of air
and then they'll float again

12:47.768 --> 12:49.751
somewhere but you won't be
able to see a whole bunch of him,

12:49.803 --> 12:52.837
you'll be able to
see just his head.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.575
SYDNEY: I think it might
be right there, right there.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.083
CHEVIE: I won't.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.863
SYDNEY: Ah, so
we're gonna have to leave,

13:18.865 --> 13:21.799
we're just gonna have
to leave this beaver here?

13:21.935 --> 13:23.785
CHEVIE: No, sometimes that
happens and if that happens

13:23.837 --> 13:25.403
it's part of it and you can't,

13:25.405 --> 13:28.072
sometimes you miss some
like that and it's okay.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.542
You really don't want that
to happen but sometimes

13:30.610 --> 13:32.577
it does so we'll
just keep an eye out.

13:38.752 --> 13:41.486
CHEVIE: We still have a
responsibility to look for that, okay?

13:41.754 --> 13:43.021
SYDNEY: Uh huh.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.758
CHEVIE: It's part of our
responsibility as hunters to

13:46.826 --> 13:49.861
make sure that we
prioritize good ethics.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.031
SYDNEY: Where's that beaver?

13:54.034 --> 13:56.835
CHEVIE: Keep on looking
over the edge of the boat.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.309
SYDNEY: If it was dead, it
should be floating by now.

14:05.846 --> 14:09.113
CHEVIE: Tomorrow, we'll come
down here with that dip net

14:09.182 --> 14:10.848
and we'll try hard.

14:10.851 --> 14:13.251
To pick it up off the bottom.

14:17.056 --> 14:19.657
CHRIS: You know,
it's The Cosna.

14:19.726 --> 14:22.026
There's nobody else out here.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.963
It's not like I can jump on
the radio and call for help.

14:26.332 --> 14:29.267
It's just Jessi and I.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.404
We have to protect ourselves.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.072
It's hunt or be hunted out here.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.674
Kill or be killed.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.943
Man, that fur is gorgeous.

14:39.012 --> 14:42.613
JESSI: Look at that, I've
never seen fur so thick and

14:42.616 --> 14:44.148
long as this ever.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.150
CHRIS: Put him right here.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.486
Now we got the bear all
skinned out and we got the

14:48.554 --> 14:50.621
quarters out it is of the
upmost importance to keep

14:50.624 --> 14:53.024
taking care of this meat.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.159
Shooting a bear going
into winter is great.

14:55.161 --> 14:58.096
It's like having a refrigerator
just outside the door.

14:58.364 --> 14:59.964
But we shot a bear
when the weather's turning,

15:00.033 --> 15:01.366
and it's getting
warmer every day.

15:01.434 --> 15:04.235
We've only got a couple days
to get this bear canned up

15:04.304 --> 15:05.770
before the meat starts to sour.

15:05.772 --> 15:08.639
Nothing ruins meat faster
than hot weather and flies.

15:08.841 --> 15:11.442
We're not gonna waste
any bit of this bear.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.377
Get it outta here.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.780
So right now, the best
thing for us to do with

15:15.848 --> 15:18.383
only two people working
this bear is just can it up.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.184
There's a nice big steak.

15:20.186 --> 15:23.521
JESSI: Wow, all right.
This is a great piece of meat.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.390
I feel bad jarring it.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.059
CHRIS: I know.

15:28.127 --> 15:29.794
It's amazing that came
off the front arm.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.213
Normally it's so
tough and stringy.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.599
But really, canning is like
the best way to preserve this.

15:36.202 --> 15:39.136
I really take a lot of extra care
when I'm processing an animal,

15:39.139 --> 15:41.005
and it's solely out of respect.

15:41.007 --> 15:43.541
This animal has sacrificed
it's life so that I may live.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.678
Ah, I feel so blessed
to get this bear.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.414
We're really lucky, we haven't
had a lot of food lately.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.149
It's not quite fishing season
yet, grouse are out of season,

15:52.152 --> 15:54.618
they're mating right now so
the only thing we've got to

15:54.621 --> 15:56.821
eat for meat is these bears.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.157
Just a little bit of salt.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.224
JESSI: Kay.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.160
And the lid, and the ring.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.828
CHRIS: Kay.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.463
JESSI: Ready?

16:07.367 --> 16:09.233
CHRIS: Awesome.

16:09.235 --> 16:10.835
JESSI: All right, so we're
just gonna put the lid on and

16:10.903 --> 16:13.905
lock it down.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.107
CHRIS: Yep, once
it starts boiling,

16:16.175 --> 16:18.109
we'll get it up to just
over ten PSI and then

16:18.177 --> 16:20.177
90 minutes later
it'll all be done.

16:20.180 --> 16:23.214
JESSI: Awesome.
Bear stew, coming soon.

16:28.454 --> 16:31.122
BRITTANY: Living out here
was definitely not my dream,

16:31.190 --> 16:32.656
it's been Kaleb's.

16:32.659 --> 16:36.127
However, the longer I'm out
here the more I love being out

16:36.195 --> 16:39.530
here and the more I
appreciate that Kaleb had the

16:39.532 --> 16:43.134
foresight so many years ago
to move us here.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.004
Wanting animals
has been my dream,

16:46.072 --> 16:48.740
and I love that we're able
to essentially marry our two

16:48.808 --> 16:51.642
dreams of living out here
and of having animals.

16:53.747 --> 16:55.213
KALEB: It's
starting to get cold.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.214
That sun's dropping.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.883
What do you think
of the floor so far?

16:58.885 --> 17:00.684
BRITTANY: This looks amazing.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.620
KALEB: Is this everything
you dreamed of and more?

17:02.688 --> 17:04.622
BRITTANY: Everything
I dreamed of and more.

17:04.690 --> 17:08.025
I cannot wait until
it's done and painted and

17:08.028 --> 17:11.362
with beautiful birds
in it laying eggs.

17:11.898 --> 17:14.098
KALEB: I'm excited
for that, too.

17:14.167 --> 17:17.035
BRITTANY: The eggs part, right?
KALEB: Yes, the eggs.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.637
BRITTANY: Maybe while you're
working on something you don't

17:19.705 --> 17:20.838
need my help with,

17:20.907 --> 17:22.440
I can start on
the nesting boxes?

17:22.508 --> 17:24.175
KALEB: Sounds good to me,

17:24.177 --> 17:26.077
and then we'll
just bolt them into place,

17:26.112 --> 17:27.378
and it'll be done.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.013
BRITTANY: Sure.

17:32.252 --> 17:35.453
So, I'm making the sign
that will go right on top

17:35.521 --> 17:37.588
of the top of the nesting box.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.193
It's going to have my
daughter that passed away

17:42.261 --> 17:44.795
almost four years ago,

17:44.798 --> 17:46.530
her name on it.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.535
Because this coop is
kind of in memory of her.

17:51.471 --> 17:55.573
Several years ago, I found
out I was pregnant with Eve.

17:57.276 --> 18:02.480
Eve had a heart condition
that made it so it was very

18:02.548 --> 18:04.215
unlikely that she
was going to live,

18:05.485 --> 18:10.754
and sadly she also had a
lung condition that meant she

18:10.757 --> 18:13.090
couldn't have the
surgeries for her heart,

18:13.093 --> 18:15.559
which meant that comfort
care was the only option.

18:15.562 --> 18:20.665
So, she died ten and a half
hours after she was born and

18:21.300 --> 18:23.567
while I was gone,

18:23.570 --> 18:26.437
one of our chickens who
had nine little chicks

18:26.439 --> 18:32.110
following her around some
animal came along and ate all

18:32.178 --> 18:34.111
the chicks and killed her.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.815
And that was just a little
bit too much for me.

18:39.652 --> 18:43.654
So, we got rid our
chickens and I'm finally ready

18:43.723 --> 18:46.390
to have chickens again,
and I'm really,

18:46.392 --> 18:48.059
really excited about that.

18:48.127 --> 18:53.264
And so, in memory of
that this coop will have

18:53.266 --> 18:56.968
little bits of the whole family
but also little bits of Eve in it.

18:58.938 --> 19:02.540
I miss her a lot, every
day we think about her.

19:03.810 --> 19:07.261
Sometimes it's because
we're sad and sometimes

19:07.313 --> 19:10.281
it's because we're happy.

19:11.351 --> 19:14.818
Going from having to be done
with chickens to having my

19:14.821 --> 19:20.658
dream coop is just really
exciting and healing in a way.

19:22.896 --> 19:24.361
She's a big part of our life,

19:24.364 --> 19:28.399
even though we only knew
her for a very short period.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.112
JOHNNY: When I'm living
a life where I'm not sure

19:41.180 --> 19:43.314
if it's work or play.

19:43.316 --> 19:46.184
I think that I'm living
a successful lifestyle.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.585
'Cause I wanna live a lifestyle
where I can't differentiate

19:47.653 --> 19:49.287
between work and play.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.264
JOHNNY: You ready, Java?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.333
Time to get foraging.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.137
The beach holds a lot of
resources that I'm gonna use

20:07.140 --> 20:09.106
for this garden.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.510
Little kelp bulb,

20:14.414 --> 20:17.515
yeah, all this stuff's gonna be
really, really good for the garden.

20:18.684 --> 20:21.018
You know, you need to
make soil and this stuff

20:21.020 --> 20:23.154
right here is gonna
create really good soil.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.925
You can almost look at
it as I'm a soil farmer,

20:29.295 --> 20:31.428
and the soil grows
the produce, not me.

20:32.232 --> 20:36.000
So, if I create good soil the
soil will create good produce.

20:40.673 --> 20:44.308
There is a little bit of
minerals in this seaweed and

20:44.310 --> 20:46.244
that's from the ocean water.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.846
And the minerals are washed on
the mountains from the rivers

20:48.848 --> 20:51.782
and the snow melt, and it
washes down to the ocean.

20:52.785 --> 20:57.321
All this seaweed kinda absorbs
a lot of those minerals which

20:57.390 --> 20:59.523
are gonna make it
into my garden.

20:59.525 --> 21:02.927
The minerals are pretty
good for this soil.

21:08.534 --> 21:11.002
I got a little finger situation,

21:11.070 --> 21:13.137
cut myself with a knife
when I was making some

21:13.139 --> 21:15.339
dog food for Java.

21:15.408 --> 21:18.342
I was just taking my time,
working with one hand.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.477
Get a little injury,
no big deal.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.147
You just gotta take care of
it and nurse it properly.

21:23.215 --> 21:26.083
The challenge is gonna be
packing 'em up and hauling 'em

21:26.152 --> 21:28.953
back up the hill.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.822
And that's the seaweed.

21:31.891 --> 21:35.626
I'm gonna hike it up
the hill, get it back,

21:35.628 --> 21:37.561
come back to the beach,
and start filling these

21:37.563 --> 21:40.197
buckets up with sand.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.169
CHEVIE: I want the Roach
family name to mean something.

21:45.171 --> 21:47.238
I want people when they hear
that name to know that they

21:47.306 --> 21:50.374
live on the land and they
have good ethics and values,

21:50.376 --> 21:53.244
and I want those things
to be passed on to my kids.

21:56.515 --> 21:57.715
CHEVIE: Let's go see
if we can find...

21:57.717 --> 21:58.649
SYDNEY: Beaver?

21:58.651 --> 21:59.917
CHEVIE: That beaver
we shot last night.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.985
We know we hit it pretty good,
but we couldn't find it,

22:01.988 --> 22:04.855
so you always have to go
back and make a good effort

22:04.857 --> 22:06.524
and look around, okay?

22:09.128 --> 22:12.529
It's my job as a parent to
teach Sydney about respecting

22:12.532 --> 22:16.867
the animals and good ethics
like we lost a beaver last

22:16.936 --> 22:19.069
night I shot it.

22:19.072 --> 22:22.806
It dove into the water, and
it happens sometimes, it does.

22:23.209 --> 22:26.060
And they'll get caught under
logs or you'll lose an animal

22:26.112 --> 22:28.412
but may be floating
the next day,

22:28.481 --> 22:30.014
so you have to
come back and look.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.316
Right here somewhere.

22:33.753 --> 22:36.220
CHEVIE: It's where
we killed it.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.355
A lot of times you
come back and look and

22:38.358 --> 22:40.090
they're not there,
they're still not there.

22:40.093 --> 22:42.693
But sometimes every once
in a while, you get lucky.

22:44.297 --> 22:45.629
Right here Sydney, it's up
against the edge right there.

22:45.631 --> 22:47.365
Is that it?

22:49.769 --> 22:52.403
CHEVIE: Holy smokes,
that's a big beaver, too.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.445
CHEVIE: Whew, we
got freaking lucky.

23:04.851 --> 23:07.184
CHEVIE: I can't see where
I hit it but we hit it good

23:07.186 --> 23:08.252
enough to kill it,

23:08.254 --> 23:09.586
but we couldn't
find it last night

23:09.589 --> 23:11.589
for whatever reason.

23:11.657 --> 23:13.190
So that's a really good
thing that we came back

23:13.192 --> 23:14.925
out and we looked for it again.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.794
Now we feel better about
shooting at 'em again,

23:16.796 --> 23:18.262
because we haven't lost one.

23:18.264 --> 23:20.063
So, we got a nice
little patch of snow right

23:20.066 --> 23:21.198
over here Sydney.

23:21.267 --> 23:22.199
SYDNEY: Yeah.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.802
CHEVIE: So, let's bury
this beaver in that snow

23:24.804 --> 23:28.539
and keep it cold.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.441
SYDNEY: Got it.

23:32.945 --> 23:35.612
CHEVIE: If you shoot something
and you can't find it,

23:35.615 --> 23:37.080
it doesn't mean it's over.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.283
You gotta come back
and you've gotta look and

23:39.285 --> 23:42.620
you have to have ethics and
put in a really good effort

23:42.688 --> 23:44.422
to find that animal.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.156
She's gonna remember
that forever.

23:46.159 --> 23:47.758
Okay, right here looks
like a fairly deep little

23:47.827 --> 23:49.159
section of snow, okay?

23:49.162 --> 23:50.093
SYDNEY: Yeah.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.429
CHEVIE: Kay, let's
put it right here.

23:52.432 --> 23:55.098
And so, it keeps kids from
just shooting stuff and

23:55.101 --> 23:57.234
walking away or people
just shooting stuff and

23:57.303 --> 24:00.103
walking away and making
really bad decisions.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.773
They gotta have good ethics
while out in the woods.

24:04.376 --> 24:07.978
So, we don't have time right
now, so we're gonna come back.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.713
SYDNEY: No one can find it.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.383
CHEVIE: Cook him up
and have a nice dinner.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.051
SYDNEY: Okay.

24:14.053 --> 24:16.987
CHEVIE: Okay, let's go. SYDNEY: We're
going now? CHEVIE: Yep. We got that done.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.522
SYDNEY: Can we hunt beaver?

24:18.591 --> 24:19.723
CHEVIE: Yeah, what
do you wanna do?

24:19.792 --> 24:21.258
You want me to cook
you something first or?

24:21.260 --> 24:22.893
SYDNEY: No, beaver.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.597
BRITTANY: When you have a
homestead there is no such

24:26.616 --> 24:27.932
thing as done.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.601
You always have a project to do.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.537
And it's great, it's a good
life but it's a hard life.

24:34.874 --> 24:37.875
This is just one more step
in being self-reliant.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.852
KALEB: Welcome to
the Chicken Minium.

24:48.554 --> 24:50.354
BRITTANY: Nice.

24:50.957 --> 24:53.423
Look at that, we got
ourselves a door again.

24:53.426 --> 24:55.359
KALEB: Door and two windows.

24:55.427 --> 24:57.294
Anything to make
those chickens happy.

24:57.430 --> 24:58.695
BRITTANY: That's for me.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.631
Anything to make your
wife happy, right?

25:00.699 --> 25:02.500
KALEB: Sure.

25:05.438 --> 25:09.006
BRITTANY: The coop though is
definitely picking up energy.

25:11.377 --> 25:14.979
Oh baby, look at that!
What'cha think, Ellie!?

25:15.848 --> 25:17.615
ELOVIE: That looks amazing, dad!

25:20.386 --> 25:21.886
ELOVIE: You're welcome.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.726
BRITTANY: This is so exciting.

25:28.794 --> 25:32.463
I love that the plan that I made
weeks ago is finally happening.

25:37.403 --> 25:39.803
Okay. This looks
really, really great.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.406
We have the coop all painted.

25:43.475 --> 25:44.408
Nice.

25:44.410 --> 25:46.944
KALEB: Got a roof and
good weatherproof paint.

25:47.746 --> 25:50.481
BRITTANY: So now we just
need to put fencing here to

25:50.549 --> 25:55.085
keep the chickens from
roaming as well as other animals

25:55.154 --> 25:57.321
from coming after them.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.158
Kaleb definitely has a
different way of grieving

26:01.160 --> 26:04.028
about Eve than I do.

26:04.096 --> 26:05.095
He's Kaleb.

26:05.097 --> 26:07.497
He doesn't necessarily
talk about it.

26:07.500 --> 26:11.501
Kaleb definitely shows his
love for me as well as Eve and

26:11.504 --> 26:14.905
Gilbert and Elovie
often times through actions.

26:15.574 --> 26:19.476
How he serves us, that is
definitely his love language.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.981
KALEB: Surely there's a
better way to put up fencing.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.716
BRITTANY: I don't know it.

26:25.784 --> 26:27.317
KALEB: There's probably a
farmer out there somewhere

26:27.320 --> 26:29.753
laughing at us right now.

26:30.055 --> 26:32.122
Okay. Come pull on the
bottom of the fence.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.407
BRITTANY: Yeah.

26:33.459 --> 26:36.060
KALEB: We're gonna just try
and tension it into place.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.428
BRITTANY: Ah, crap!

26:42.752 --> 26:45.419
GILBERT: Are you okay?

26:45.487 --> 26:46.820
KALEB: What did you do?

26:46.822 --> 26:48.956
BRITTANY: I was pulling
it 'cause you told me to,

26:48.958 --> 26:51.892
and then I fell over
'cause that pushed me over.

26:51.961 --> 26:53.894
KALEB: Here, how about
Gilbert holds this up.

26:53.963 --> 26:54.828
BRITTANY: Okay.

26:54.830 --> 26:57.197
GILBERT: No, how
about I pull on that?

26:57.700 --> 26:58.765
KALEB: Gilbert.

26:58.768 --> 27:00.100
BRITTANY: We just need
to get this in 'cause the

27:00.169 --> 27:01.835
chickens are coming.

27:01.837 --> 27:05.305
It's going to be really
great to have farm-fresh eggs

27:05.308 --> 27:06.507
right on our homestead.

27:06.575 --> 27:08.241
We can walk outside our door,

27:08.244 --> 27:10.777
go to the chicken coup
and get our breakfast.

27:10.779 --> 27:12.646
Fresh eggs squeezed daily.

27:12.715 --> 27:15.515
As opposed to having to go
into town for something as

27:15.518 --> 27:18.051
simple as eggs.

27:18.387 --> 27:19.319
KALEB: There we go.

27:19.322 --> 27:20.521
We got us a chicken run.

27:20.589 --> 27:21.789
Fencing complete.

27:21.857 --> 27:24.191
I'm gonna have to
hang up my shingle.

27:24.259 --> 27:26.760
Kaleb Rowland, pro-fencer.

27:27.730 --> 27:29.997
BRITTANY: Maybe don't
quit your day job.

27:30.333 --> 27:33.200
JOHNNY: To me,
challenges are all equal.

27:33.736 --> 27:35.536
Every season has
its difficulties.

27:36.072 --> 27:39.340
As the seasons change, the
resources move, and so do I,

27:39.742 --> 27:42.710
and that's part of the subsistence
lifestyle and that's how I live.

27:44.480 --> 27:46.347
This is where I
come to get shells.

27:46.415 --> 27:49.016
There's a lot of clam
shells scattered about.

27:49.018 --> 27:50.751
I'm gonna use 'em for
calcium in my garden.

27:50.819 --> 27:53.988
It's good for the plants,
and I'm gonna crush 'em up.

27:55.358 --> 27:58.892
And use the crushed-up shells
to feed my plants calcium,

27:58.961 --> 28:01.228
'cause they need that
to be nice and strong.

28:01.230 --> 28:03.697
And it'll help me
yield a really good,

28:03.699 --> 28:06.166
really healthy garden.

28:06.369 --> 28:09.436
I'm gonna get to the clamming
grounds right over here,

28:09.438 --> 28:12.172
right up over this hill.

28:12.174 --> 28:15.209
I got a little audience here,
a bunch of little seals.

28:15.778 --> 28:18.345
What's up little dudes?

28:21.583 --> 28:22.983
You know if they're here,
that means there's gotta be

28:22.985 --> 28:24.318
some clams as well,

28:24.386 --> 28:26.920
'cause they eat all that stuff.

28:28.590 --> 28:30.991
I don't have these
beaches in the Brooks Range.

28:31.060 --> 28:34.261
So, when I'm down here
at my summer outpost,

28:34.329 --> 28:36.196
I like to take
advantage of the beach.

28:36.198 --> 28:38.599
Java! That's a good girl!

28:39.268 --> 28:41.134
You gotta find the good times
out here 'cause the balance

28:41.137 --> 28:43.070
out the bad times.

28:43.272 --> 28:44.938
You know going to
the beach, hanging out,

28:44.957 --> 28:47.374
collecting some
shells for the garden.

28:48.077 --> 28:50.511
It's fun to hang out with Java.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.550
I'll take 'em.

29:01.757 --> 29:04.024
It's nice living in a place
where I can just come out here,

29:04.026 --> 29:07.828
get the resources I need,
you know, get the job done.

29:09.698 --> 29:10.697
And it's fun.

29:10.766 --> 29:13.434
I'm outside,
standing on a beach,

29:13.502 --> 29:15.769
hanging out with my dog.

29:16.038 --> 29:19.540
And it's just, uh, really
grateful for these moments.

29:24.580 --> 29:26.513
Let's see if we can put
ourselves in some clammys.

29:26.515 --> 29:28.782
It'd be nice to find some
with meat in 'em, but if not,

29:28.851 --> 29:31.218
I'm still meeting my objective.

29:36.325 --> 29:37.924
CHRIS: When you're living a
lifestyle like this and you're

29:37.927 --> 29:39.326
living one with nature,
you have to respect every

29:39.394 --> 29:42.129
gift that's given to you,
and if you don't,

29:42.197 --> 29:44.164
the world will just
take it away from you.

29:46.335 --> 29:48.302
JESSI: This is very difficult.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.506
CHRIS: Gross.

29:53.408 --> 29:55.008
Now that everything's
settled down,

29:55.010 --> 29:58.145
we're gonna make a really nice
pliable fur that we can make

29:58.213 --> 30:00.614
all sorts of things out of.

30:01.217 --> 30:03.483
When you're fleshing it,
you're pretty much just taking

30:03.486 --> 30:05.686
all the meat and skin
and fat that's on that hide

30:05.754 --> 30:07.154
and getting it off.

30:07.156 --> 30:08.989
It's quite a process.

30:11.427 --> 30:13.227
Oh, you know what I forgot,
I was supposed to go, um.

30:13.295 --> 30:14.428
JESSI: No, you weren't.

30:14.496 --> 30:15.629
This is what you're
supposed to do.

30:15.697 --> 30:16.897
You're not doing anything else.

30:16.899 --> 30:18.165
Nothing else. Nothing to do.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.033
CHRIS: Uh, like, uh, I think
there was a three-wheeler

30:20.035 --> 30:21.235
I had to work on or there was a,

30:21.303 --> 30:22.503
I have to go cut firewood.

30:22.571 --> 30:24.104
JESSI: Out here there's
nobody to phone call you

30:24.106 --> 30:27.074
for you to shirk
your responsibilities.

30:29.979 --> 30:31.778
I think it's done.

30:31.780 --> 30:32.779
Pull it over.

30:32.781 --> 30:34.781
CHRIS: Wow.

30:34.850 --> 30:36.449
JESSI: Look at that fur!

30:36.452 --> 30:37.918
It's so amazing.

30:37.986 --> 30:40.320
CHRIS: What a
beautiful fur, Jess.

30:40.990 --> 30:43.857
Just a few days ago, this
bear was banging on our door.

30:43.859 --> 30:46.126
And now here he is,
we got a full pantry,

30:46.195 --> 30:48.328
and we got this beautiful fur
we can make something out of.

30:48.397 --> 30:50.030
We really did a good job.

30:50.599 --> 30:52.065
It's just a little wet.

30:52.067 --> 30:53.734
JESSI: It is a
little wet though.

30:53.802 --> 30:56.603
What do you think we let it
just air-dry for a little bit

30:56.605 --> 30:58.005
and we go for a hike,

30:58.073 --> 30:59.940
we come back and roll
it up and bring it back in.

31:00.008 --> 31:00.874
CHRIS: Perfect.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.275
JESSI: All right.

31:02.278 --> 31:06.012
It's gonna be a Morse family
break that we all needed.

31:07.015 --> 31:09.349
CHRIS: We haven't left very far
from our cabin the last few days,

31:09.351 --> 31:11.351
so with the big
predator out of the way,

31:11.353 --> 31:14.021
we're just gonna
go for a nice hike.

31:14.490 --> 31:17.557
I don't know what we'd do if
that bear got in the house.

31:17.759 --> 31:20.561
If you've got a pissed off bear,
you're gonna lose.

31:21.296 --> 31:22.696
When fear starts to take hold,

31:22.764 --> 31:24.497
it gets in and it
ruins everything.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.032
You don't wanna go
out and go hiking.

31:26.035 --> 31:27.968
You don't wanna go out and
enjoy the land because you

31:27.970 --> 31:30.704
think that there's
something out in the woods.

31:30.906 --> 31:32.606
JESSI: Gross.
What's that from?

31:34.176 --> 31:36.109
CHRIS: That is a big
pile of bear crap,

31:38.847 --> 31:40.647
from probably last night.

31:40.649 --> 31:42.349
Well, that's not good.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.174
CHRIS: Stay close, Toze.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.309
I thought after
we shot that bear,

31:52.311 --> 31:53.844
we weren't gonna have
any more bear problems,

31:53.912 --> 31:54.978
but I mean,

31:55.047 --> 31:58.982
this bear has come by in
the last day or two at max.

32:00.118 --> 32:01.919
That is really fresh (bleep).

32:03.255 --> 32:06.256
JESSI: I guess I thought
they were kind of territorial,

32:06.325 --> 32:09.125
and I thought that if we killed
that bear that's been here,

32:09.128 --> 32:10.927
and it's been coming by that.

32:10.930 --> 32:14.197
CHRIS: Well, obviously,
as soon as you shoot a bear,

32:14.199 --> 32:16.066
another bear moves
into the territory.

32:16.068 --> 32:18.001
There are so many bears
this year and there's nothing

32:18.003 --> 32:20.203
for them to eat that
they're really working on

32:20.272 --> 32:22.005
getting food and
they're coming in,

32:22.007 --> 32:23.607
and they're coming
towards our camp 'cause

32:23.675 --> 32:24.808
they smell the dog.

32:24.876 --> 32:26.076
They smell us barbecuing.

32:26.144 --> 32:29.746
Like we're the only people
out here for miles-upon-miles,

32:29.815 --> 32:32.415
and so they can smell us.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.017
You know and if there's
nothing else for them to eat,

32:34.086 --> 32:35.886
they're gonna be
coming towards us.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.755
So, the only thing we can
do is protect ourselves,

32:38.757 --> 32:40.490
and what we need to do is
just make sure the camp's

32:40.492 --> 32:43.527
clean and stop letting Toze
out of house by herself at night.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.630
This bear is so close
to the house that if Toze

32:46.698 --> 32:48.298
had been wandering around
like normal last night,

32:48.367 --> 32:49.766
she'd probably have been eaten,

32:49.835 --> 32:52.669
or at least mauled half
to death, which is terrible.

32:53.639 --> 32:54.838
JESSI: Yikes.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.107
Well, let's grab Toze and.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.843
CHRIS: Come on Toze,
let's heal up and go home.

33:00.045 --> 33:01.578
Well Toze, what do you think?

33:01.580 --> 33:04.381
You wanna go home and
bear-proof the cabin with us?

33:04.383 --> 33:06.483
Yeah? Let's go.

33:07.252 --> 33:08.718
Damn. All right.

33:08.721 --> 33:10.854
Well, let's get heading back.
We got a lot of work to do.

33:10.922 --> 33:13.623
This sucks. Damn bears.

33:17.129 --> 33:18.595
CHEVIE: It's not about money.

33:18.597 --> 33:19.929
It's knowledge,

33:19.932 --> 33:23.199
and the only way you get
that knowledge is by learning,

33:23.602 --> 33:25.201
and learning
from people around you,

33:25.204 --> 33:27.571
learning from
first-hand experiences.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.006
You're out here
hunting with me, okay?

33:30.009 --> 33:31.074
SYDNEY: Okay.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.475
CHEVIE: We're gonna try
to get you a beaver here.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.077
SYDNEY: Yay.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.747
CHEVIE: So, going out,
being on the land,

33:36.815 --> 33:38.281
being opportunists,

33:38.283 --> 33:41.217
it's work to
capitalize on animals.

33:41.220 --> 33:45.755
It takes a lot of patience,
long days, early mornings,

33:46.091 --> 33:48.959
waiting for a long
time in certain areas.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.362
And Sydney has that
patience to be successful,

33:52.364 --> 33:55.298
so with that patience
and the learned know-how,

33:55.300 --> 33:57.667
I think that she'll
be really successful.

34:04.976 --> 34:06.410
Sydney, beaver.

34:08.847 --> 34:11.548
CHEVIE: There was a beaver
sitting right up on land right there.

34:12.651 --> 34:14.651
Be ready, baby.

34:16.321 --> 34:17.987
You gotta be watching
for it to come up and give

34:17.990 --> 34:19.956
yourself a better opportunity.

34:20.459 --> 34:21.925
SYDNEY: Okay.

34:30.135 --> 34:32.669
CHEVIE: Sydney, be
looking for bubbles.

34:32.671 --> 34:33.937
Okay?

34:34.005 --> 34:35.605
When you see those
bubbles start coming up,

34:35.607 --> 34:37.441
that means it's getting
ready to come up.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.342
Right there in front of you.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.010
Right there in front of you,
baby, to your right.

34:41.013 --> 34:42.612
Cock it and shoot it.

34:45.884 --> 34:47.217
(gunshot)

34:53.492 --> 34:54.758
CHEVIE: A little bit above it.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.660
Okay. Come here.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.362
We gotta be ready though, okay?

34:59.431 --> 35:02.199
At least you got a
freaking shot off, okay?

35:09.307 --> 35:10.807
Right in front of us.

35:14.713 --> 35:17.013
CHEVIE: Okay.

35:19.384 --> 35:21.384
Get ready this
next time though, okay?

35:21.386 --> 35:22.719
Get ready.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.866
Let's just give it a
second right in here.

35:36.869 --> 35:39.736
I can see a wake going
back and forth, back and forth.

35:42.073 --> 35:44.007
Holy (bleep).

35:44.409 --> 35:45.408
It's gonna come up right there.

35:45.410 --> 35:47.677
There it is, right
by the bank, Sydney.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.213
Right by the bank.

35:50.282 --> 35:51.515
(gunshot)

35:54.886 --> 35:57.020
CHEVIE: Yeah, Syd, you've done,
you're doing a good job.

35:57.289 --> 35:58.421
SYDNEY: Uh-hmm.

35:58.423 --> 36:00.156
CHEVIE: A really good job.
Those beaver are fast, huh?

36:00.159 --> 36:01.224
SYDNEY: Uh-huh.

36:01.293 --> 36:02.692
CHEVIE: And you know
the most important thing

36:02.761 --> 36:03.894
too that you've done
that's super good?

36:03.962 --> 36:04.895
SYDNEY: What?

36:04.963 --> 36:06.296
CHEVIE: Your gun safety's
been really good.

36:06.298 --> 36:07.897
All of that is more
important than,

36:07.900 --> 36:10.833
than even getting a beaver
or getting an animal, okay?

36:11.036 --> 36:13.737
SYDNEY: Okay. Uh-huh.
CHEVIE: It's cold out, huh?

36:14.239 --> 36:15.438
SYDNEY: Uh-hmm.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.307
CHEVIE: You can just
sit back and relax and watch

36:17.309 --> 36:18.575
your dad, okay?

36:18.577 --> 36:20.510
SYDNEY: Uh-hmm.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.450
CHEVIE: That beaver
swimming up there now?

36:27.653 --> 36:29.019
I see it.

36:31.256 --> 36:32.722
CHEVIE: We're just gonna
watch him from here and

36:32.724 --> 36:34.658
see if he comes down
here towards us.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.060
SYDNEY: Okay.

36:37.329 --> 36:39.496
CHEVIE: It's coming towards us.

36:44.069 --> 36:45.135
(gunshot)

36:53.628 --> 36:56.263
(gunshot)

36:59.434 --> 37:01.100
CHEVIE: That one's
floating, okay, baby?

37:01.103 --> 37:03.169
SYDNEY: It's floating?
CHEVIE: Yup. SYDNEY: Yes!

37:16.518 --> 37:17.784
CHEVIE: Okay, you
see it right there coming up?

37:17.852 --> 37:19.119
SYDNEY: Yeah, I see it.

37:21.790 --> 37:24.024
CHEVIE: It's okay. Watch
the dog. Maybe the dog'll get it.

37:25.460 --> 37:26.893
CHEVIE: See what happens
with old Thor here.

37:27.663 --> 37:28.862
This'll be a first.

37:28.930 --> 37:34.000
Good boy. Get it.
Get it. Good boy.

37:38.540 --> 37:40.941
Wow. Look at that pose.

37:44.813 --> 37:46.279
Okay, Sydney.
You wanna go grab it?

37:48.216 --> 37:49.583
CHEVIE: Grab its tail.

37:51.887 --> 37:53.987
CHEVIE: Grab its tail.

37:54.689 --> 37:56.356
And then grab its back feet.

37:56.424 --> 37:57.824
Grab one foot and
then the other one.

38:00.362 --> 38:01.361
CHEVIE: Yup.

38:01.429 --> 38:02.962
Okay, now you can
step on the boat,

38:02.965 --> 38:04.030
and you just drag
it over the bow.

38:04.032 --> 38:05.465
SYDNEY: Okay.

38:07.035 --> 38:09.569
CHEVIE: Okay.
Now right there, perfect.

38:09.571 --> 38:10.637
Right there.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.505
SYDNEY: Okay.
CHEVIE: Okay?

38:12.507 --> 38:15.041
Just grazed it in the back,
grazed it in the head.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.647
CHEVIE: That one I
just barely got it.

38:20.715 --> 38:21.848
SYDNEY: Yeah.

38:21.916 --> 38:23.650
CHEVIE: I didn't
hit it real good.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.186
It's good that we got that
'cause there were some people

38:26.221 --> 38:28.321
in town that were
asking for beaver meat.

38:28.390 --> 38:29.522
SYDNEY: Like who?

38:29.524 --> 38:32.525
CHEVIE: Uh, George and
Alice, and grandma.

38:32.527 --> 38:33.726
Are you happy for the beaver?

38:33.729 --> 38:34.927
SYDNEY: Yes.

38:34.930 --> 38:36.329
CHEVIE: Ready to go home
and, and, and have a snack

38:36.331 --> 38:37.731
and some hot chocolate?

38:37.799 --> 38:39.132
SYDNEY: Yeah.
CHEVIE: All right.

38:39.134 --> 38:41.001
We'll get home
here pretty quick.

38:43.805 --> 38:47.340
The goal with the beaver hunt
was to get Sydney to be able

38:47.409 --> 38:50.143
to get her gun up and get
a shot on that moving animal.

38:51.079 --> 38:52.612
She wasn't able to shoot one,

38:52.681 --> 38:53.746
but that was okay.

38:53.749 --> 38:56.683
She got to the point
where I wanted her to be.

38:56.685 --> 38:59.719
So, I think it was a
successful beaver hunt.

39:01.023 --> 39:03.289
You know, this is something
that I've done with my dad and

39:03.358 --> 39:04.624
my dad did with his dad,

39:04.693 --> 39:06.292
and it's kinda of the
legacy of what we do and so,

39:06.361 --> 39:09.829
I can just pass
that down to Sydney.

39:09.898 --> 39:11.998
That's what makes the memory.

39:19.507 --> 39:21.841
CHRIS: These are
gonna be so good.

39:21.843 --> 39:23.443
You ready to eat?

39:23.645 --> 39:26.312
JESSI: I've been thinking
about it for quite some time.

39:26.314 --> 39:27.981
CHRIS: Look at these ribs.

39:28.917 --> 39:30.717
Oh, yeah.

39:31.252 --> 39:32.919
What a whirlwind the last
couple days has been.

39:32.987 --> 39:34.320
JESSI: We're safe.

39:34.389 --> 39:35.655
The dog's safe.

39:35.657 --> 39:37.824
And we got so much
meat off of the bear.

39:38.259 --> 39:39.859
CHRIS: Just wow.

39:39.928 --> 39:41.461
JESSI: That hide. The fur.

39:41.463 --> 39:42.662
CHRIS: I know.

39:42.664 --> 39:43.997
I mean, I know he
was a nuisance bear,

39:44.065 --> 39:45.331
and he was coming around
and he was aggressive.

39:45.333 --> 39:46.666
I still hate taking a life.

39:46.735 --> 39:49.636
But I am so thankful
for this meat.

39:50.539 --> 39:52.338
These are cooked.

39:52.340 --> 39:53.940
Look at this rib.

39:54.008 --> 39:56.042
JESSI: Cheers.

39:56.478 --> 39:58.010
CHRIS: Love you.

39:58.013 --> 39:59.879
There was a lot of scary
moments in the beginning,

39:59.948 --> 40:01.347
but at the end of this,

40:01.416 --> 40:03.149
we're really lucky
to live this lifestyle.

40:03.218 --> 40:05.151
I wouldn't trade
it for anything.

40:05.420 --> 40:07.353
JESSI: This bear has brought
so much more than a meal.

40:07.355 --> 40:08.488
It's a wakeup call.

40:08.556 --> 40:10.690
The Cosna's coming for ya.

40:10.759 --> 40:13.226
Don't get too comfortable,
because something might be

40:13.228 --> 40:15.962
right outside your front door.

40:21.436 --> 40:23.303
JOHNNY: Java, you always like
to keep the mood light around here,

40:23.371 --> 40:25.371
don't you?

40:25.707 --> 40:27.907
So, I'm gonna put down
this compost material here.

40:27.909 --> 40:30.977
I'm gonna fill up these boxes,
be able to plant some plants,

40:31.179 --> 40:32.512
put some seaweed on top,

40:32.580 --> 40:35.115
sprinkle a little
love of calcium on top.

40:35.450 --> 40:37.850
Should be a really nice garden.

40:38.186 --> 40:40.053
I've always looked
forward to growing some produce

40:40.121 --> 40:41.587
and a dog.

40:41.590 --> 40:43.656
It's moments like this
that make the hard work

40:43.658 --> 40:45.792
a little more fun.

40:45.794 --> 40:46.793
All right, Java.

40:46.861 --> 40:48.194
I'm gonna go get the plants.

40:48.196 --> 40:50.797
Let me know if there's, uh,
anything I can do for you.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.334
This is just a step further
in being self-sufficient,

40:54.402 --> 40:57.537
and this is a step closer
to that ultimate Alaskan goal

40:57.806 --> 41:00.774
and dream that I had
when I first moved here.

41:02.477 --> 41:03.876
It's important to see growth.

41:03.879 --> 41:06.279
I think it's important
to have something in your

41:06.347 --> 41:07.614
life to nurture.

41:07.682 --> 41:09.549
Whether it's plants,
people, pets.

41:09.551 --> 41:12.786
I think that's what makes
a good, balanced human.

41:14.355 --> 41:16.422
Yeah, garden's shaping
up pretty good.

41:16.625 --> 41:18.424
I think that's gonna do it.

41:18.426 --> 41:21.628
Kudos. Little pat on my back.

41:21.896 --> 41:24.430
Java, good girl.
Come on.

41:29.237 --> 41:31.638
BRITTANY: Hello
little chicky-chikies.

41:32.774 --> 41:35.742
Hi. How are you?

41:37.445 --> 41:39.345
All right, shall we
bring 'em inside?

41:40.515 --> 41:41.981
ELOVIE: We have the eggs?

41:41.983 --> 41:44.383
BRITTANY: Girlies,
you ready for your new coup?

41:44.386 --> 41:45.651
KALEB: There ya go.

41:45.654 --> 41:47.821
ELOVIE: They like it.

41:50.525 --> 41:52.124
KALEB: I think this
chicken coup is a significant

41:52.127 --> 41:54.193
step for Brittany.

41:54.195 --> 41:58.064
We lost a child four
years ago and it hurt.

41:58.066 --> 42:00.199
It hurt a lot.

42:00.202 --> 42:04.003
And it's something that
you don't ever truly get over.

42:04.005 --> 42:06.606
But this chicken
coup marks a turn.

42:06.608 --> 42:10.276
It marks a turn for getting
back to doing something that

42:10.345 --> 42:13.413
we could not do after
Eve passed away.

42:14.482 --> 42:17.817
So, I think this is
a mark of progression.

42:18.820 --> 42:22.555
Another little milestone
in the healing process after

42:22.557 --> 42:25.592
losing something so
precious as a daughter.

42:27.295 --> 42:28.895
BRITTANY: It just
makes me so happy,

42:28.963 --> 42:33.366
like seeing all those
cluckers out there.

42:33.434 --> 42:36.970
It's just very lovely.

42:37.572 --> 42:39.906
Kaleb is really
amazing at building,

42:39.908 --> 42:43.009
and I think that when he
builds things for our family,

42:43.044 --> 42:48.047
it's really him showing his
love for what we're needing

42:48.116 --> 42:49.515
and what we're wanting,

42:49.517 --> 42:52.018
and I really appreciate that.

42:53.588 --> 42:57.056
This coup symbolizes a lot
more than just fresh eggs.

42:59.060 --> 43:01.193
CHEVIE: George, you said you
wanted a beaver a couple days ago,

43:01.196 --> 43:02.595
so I thought I'd
bring 'em over here.

43:02.597 --> 43:04.397
Sydney and I were
down at the cabin.

43:04.465 --> 43:06.132
She helped me hunt.

43:06.134 --> 43:07.266
GEORGE: It's a
nice one, Chevie.

43:07.269 --> 43:08.468
CHEVIE: Yeah.

43:08.536 --> 43:11.137
So, it's important when we're
out collecting any food off

43:11.205 --> 43:14.173
the land that you share your
fortunes with other people,

43:14.943 --> 43:16.275
and it helps the community.

43:16.278 --> 43:18.678
If you give, you will get back.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.680
It all goes in a nice
circle and the kids are

43:20.682 --> 43:22.348
involved in that.

43:22.350 --> 43:23.683
GEORGE: All right.
Thank you, man.

43:23.751 --> 43:26.286
CHEVIE: Okay. Sounds good.
GEORGE: Okay, you guys!

43:27.555 --> 43:30.489
CHEVIE: All right.
Well, we gave him the beaver.

43:30.959 --> 43:32.025
Let's cook one and eat some.

43:32.093 --> 43:33.693
SYDNEY: Uh-huh, I
really like beaver hunting,

43:33.695 --> 43:34.761
so fun.

43:34.829 --> 43:36.829
CHEVIE: Cool.

43:37.098 --> 43:40.099
So, when we go out and
get food from the land,

43:40.101 --> 43:43.503
we appreciate what nature
has to offer out here,

43:43.705 --> 43:45.638
which sometimes can be harsh.

43:45.707 --> 43:48.240
But it's this beautiful
playground for us to

43:48.243 --> 43:50.176
be able to be in.

43:50.178 --> 43:52.845
Being able to
sustain yourself in this

43:52.914 --> 43:55.915
harsh environment
and thrive doing it,

43:55.917 --> 43:58.918
we don't have a certificate
that says congratulations.

43:59.454 --> 44:01.454
We just put one foot
in front of the other and

44:01.522 --> 44:03.256
get it done, and that's,

44:03.291 --> 44:05.391
that's good enough.

44:05.927 --> 44:09.128
Yeah, this is exactly why your mom
and I wanted to build this cabin honey,

44:09.197 --> 44:10.797
so we can have these
memories so we can come

44:10.865 --> 44:12.732
out here and hunt
outta here and enjoy these

44:12.734 --> 44:14.467
times with you.

44:14.469 --> 44:16.669
That hot chocolate warming
you up a little bit?

44:16.671 --> 44:18.404
SYDNEY: A tiny bit.

44:18.473 --> 44:20.206
CHEVIE: You better drink
it a little faster.
