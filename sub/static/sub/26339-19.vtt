WEBVTT

00:02.109 --> 00:04.109
Okay, Jan. Wow.

00:04.187 --> 00:05.277
What am I looking at?

00:05.379 --> 00:07.579
I call it "Jan vs. Predator."

00:07.689 --> 00:10.349
- Hm. And who comes out on top?
- Predator.

00:10.417 --> 00:11.783
Thanks so much, Jan.

00:12.753 --> 00:14.019
Blech!

00:14.111 --> 00:16.685
Feels like I'm trapped in
"Antiques Roadshow: Harrisburg."

00:16.748 --> 00:19.048
Oh, thank God! A friend!

00:19.150 --> 00:21.117
Here to bail me out
with the perfect, unique,

00:21.219 --> 00:22.952
well-thought-out donation.

00:23.054 --> 00:24.520
- Steak knives? Wow.
- I'm sorry.

00:24.589 --> 00:27.123
Work has just gotten so crazy,
I didn't have time to curate

00:27.191 --> 00:29.058
one of my signature
silent auction baskets.

00:29.160 --> 00:32.261
And I'm not going to donate
a non-curated basket.

00:32.363 --> 00:33.415
Give the man a break.

00:33.493 --> 00:34.962
He does the weather every time
Guy McCormick is sick.

00:35.032 --> 00:37.466
And, let's face it, he's sick,
like, three times a week.

00:37.568 --> 00:39.034
"Sick"? Please. The man drinks.

00:39.129 --> 00:40.780
Mr. McCormick
has checked into a facility.

00:40.805 --> 00:42.037
That's all I'm allowed to say.

00:42.106 --> 00:44.340
But it does mean that I'm
going to be doing the weather

00:44.409 --> 00:46.609
for the next 28 nights.

00:46.711 --> 00:48.626
Will, I'm very happy that
you've become a local celebrity.

00:48.704 --> 00:50.969
- No!
- But that doesn't help me right now.

00:51.070 --> 00:52.797
Right now, what I need from you
is an auction item.

00:52.850 --> 00:55.785
Are you blind? Will is the item!

00:55.887 --> 00:58.154
Celebrity is the most precious
metal we have.

00:58.222 --> 00:59.522
It's our Vibranium!

00:59.624 --> 01:00.823
You mean I'm like Black Panther?

01:00.925 --> 01:02.324
- No.
- Sorry.

01:02.393 --> 01:03.692
It was in front of my face
the whole time.

01:03.795 --> 01:06.031
Will, you are the item!

01:06.056 --> 01:07.155
Can I put you in the auction?

01:07.180 --> 01:09.490
You mean like be someone's
butler for a month? Sure.

01:09.567 --> 01:11.066
No, but it's weird
that you'd be okay with that.

01:11.169 --> 01:12.368
I mean a lunch.

01:12.437 --> 01:14.470
A meal with a local
10:00 P.M. fill-in weatherman

01:14.539 --> 01:16.038
could be just the pop
this auction needs.

01:16.107 --> 01:17.740
Maybe.

01:17.842 --> 01:19.975
I mean, my star is on the rise.

01:20.077 --> 01:22.077
Finally got my own lapel mic,

01:22.180 --> 01:23.846
unlimited access to the green screen,

01:23.948 --> 01:26.549
and I'm really honing in
on my on-air laugh.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.050
Ah ha ha ha ha!

01:28.119 --> 01:29.351
Back to you, Julie.

01:30.755 --> 01:32.521
- I'm in!
- Yes!

01:32.590 --> 01:34.056
Blank CDs? Unh-unh.

01:34.158 --> 01:35.825
Keep walking. Don't even set those down.

01:35.927 --> 01:37.226
Do better, Celeste!

01:37.328 --> 01:40.529
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

01:45.069 --> 01:47.236
"Gift card... balance unknown."

01:47.338 --> 01:49.305
- D'Amato, you donated this?
- Yeah.

01:49.407 --> 01:51.261
I have no idea how much is on there.

01:51.370 --> 01:53.152
Could be $250, could be $12.

01:53.236 --> 01:54.425
That's what makes it so exciting

01:54.449 --> 01:55.545
- to bid on!
- Yeah.

01:55.546 --> 01:57.079
I'm jealous of everyone here.

01:57.181 --> 01:58.981
- What'd you donate?
- This.

01:59.083 --> 02:01.150
I can't wait to see
what someone's willing to pay

02:01.252 --> 02:02.585
for $100.

02:02.687 --> 02:05.187
Oh, well, if the bidding's low,
I'm gonna jump in.

02:05.256 --> 02:07.790
Today I got the news
that every parent dreads most.

02:07.892 --> 02:10.158
I have signed up to participate

02:10.261 --> 02:12.428
in the sport of ice hockey.

02:16.667 --> 02:18.567
It's the most expensive sport
on the plant,

02:18.669 --> 02:20.536
unless you count fencing, which I don't.

02:20.605 --> 02:23.038
Yeah, diving's the dream.
No gear of any kind.

02:23.140 --> 02:25.875
It's 1/5 of a normal sports uniform.

02:25.977 --> 02:28.143
Just a Speedo and a towel.

02:28.246 --> 02:29.845
And I already have towels.

02:29.947 --> 02:32.694
Listen, if Pee-Wee Sports is
driving you to financial ruin,

02:32.780 --> 02:34.483
then you're doing something wrong.

02:34.546 --> 02:35.784
Let's take a look at your budget.

02:35.887 --> 02:37.786
If you even have one.

02:37.889 --> 02:38.954
I'm a single mother living in

02:39.056 --> 02:41.290
the second most expensive city
in the country.

02:41.392 --> 02:42.458
I budget.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.026
I budget hard.

02:45.997 --> 02:47.162
Hey.

02:47.265 --> 02:49.169
Am I allowed to be here?
I mean, what are the rules?

02:49.270 --> 02:50.833
Is it like a candidate not being allowed

02:50.935 --> 02:52.968
within 100 feet of a polling place or...

02:53.070 --> 02:54.737
Wait, nobody's bid on me yet?

02:54.839 --> 02:56.438
The auction just started,

02:56.507 --> 02:58.173
and no one goes near
the big-ticket items

02:58.276 --> 02:59.708
until they're at least two Cabs deep.

02:59.810 --> 03:00.976
And you're a big-ticket item.

03:01.078 --> 03:02.478
- Cool.
- Yeah.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.413
You hear that?
We're the big-ticket item.

03:04.482 --> 03:05.447
All right, Dad.

03:05.550 --> 03:07.816
Self-directed pep talk over. Take a lap.

03:07.919 --> 03:09.919
Yeah, yeah, a lap. That's a good idea.

03:15.927 --> 03:17.059
Okay.

03:17.128 --> 03:19.762
My dad's self-esteem pendulum
is very lubricated.

03:19.797 --> 03:22.064
It swings far and fast
in both directions.

03:22.133 --> 03:25.067
And now that he's on TV,
it's even worse.

03:25.169 --> 03:26.535
Sophie, the promo's starting!

03:26.637 --> 03:28.404
It's starting!

03:28.472 --> 03:29.977
<i>Who is KZOP at 10:00?</i>

03:30.047 --> 03:32.649
<i>It's news with anchor Julie Fong-Nunez!</i>

03:32.735 --> 03:35.303
<i>Investigative journalism
with Loni McGraw!</i>

03:35.413 --> 03:38.530
<i>"What's Yummy Now?"
with Chef Martin Bullrock@</i>

03:38.600 --> 03:40.655
<i>Sports with Chet Corners!</i>

03:40.733 --> 03:42.017
<i>And weather!</i>

03:42.086 --> 03:44.820
<i>KZOP at 10:00. We got you.</i>

03:44.922 --> 03:46.422
Leave me.

03:46.490 --> 03:48.171
Ooh, I love that sun.

03:48.264 --> 03:50.359
You can tell by his sunglasses
that he's nasty.

03:50.421 --> 03:52.094
That sun made my dad cry.

03:52.163 --> 03:54.096
Poppy, someone has to bid on him.

03:54.198 --> 03:55.965
This isn't just a silent auction.

03:56.067 --> 03:57.132
This is a man's life.

03:57.234 --> 03:58.534
You're right.

03:58.636 --> 04:01.167
Crap. Garbage. Trash.

04:01.230 --> 04:02.763
Garbage.

04:02.873 --> 04:04.273
Yoga pants for a dog?!

04:04.342 --> 04:06.260
Stop dressing your dogs, America.

04:06.326 --> 04:07.542
Dogs should be naked.

04:10.848 --> 04:12.581
What do we have here?

04:12.650 --> 04:14.717
Oh, my gosh, you poor thing.

04:14.795 --> 04:16.096
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

04:16.144 --> 04:18.619
It's okay. It's okay.
You don't have to be scared anymore.

04:18.689 --> 04:20.623
I will make you fly again.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.191
Do you girls have any idea what this is?

04:22.293 --> 04:23.492
A hat.

04:23.561 --> 04:25.636
A hat? A hat?!

04:25.663 --> 04:27.043
This is a beret.

04:27.113 --> 04:28.530
French sophistication distilled

04:28.633 --> 04:31.634
into one timeless piece of headwear.

04:31.736 --> 04:33.402
And it will be mine.

04:33.504 --> 04:35.537
Miggy, shut up. This is important.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.339
I need an adult
to bid on this beret for me.

04:38.376 --> 04:39.508
That thing? Why?

04:39.543 --> 04:40.643
Geez, Grandpa.

04:40.745 --> 04:42.778
Because, like Monica Lewinsky,

04:42.847 --> 04:45.381
K-pop singer Min-ho,
and Jack Nicholson as the Joker,

04:45.483 --> 04:46.949
I have style. You don't.

04:47.018 --> 04:48.350
I adopt early. You don't.

04:48.452 --> 04:49.785
I lead, and you...

04:49.854 --> 04:50.886
have no taste.

04:50.988 --> 04:52.354
If you're gonna be mean
about it, forget it.

04:52.423 --> 04:54.456
- Your mom can bid on it.
- Please?

04:54.558 --> 04:56.825
- Fine.
- Follow me, girls.

04:56.927 --> 04:59.261
Jocelyn's dad is auctioning
one of his "ceramics,"

04:59.363 --> 05:00.796
and I have thoughts.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.799
Okay, rent looks good.

05:03.868 --> 05:05.200
What is this tab labeled?

05:05.302 --> 05:07.102
That's my convenience tax.
I can't touch that.

05:07.138 --> 05:08.470
What's a convenience tax?

05:08.572 --> 05:10.539
It's money I spend
to make my life a little easier.

05:10.641 --> 05:13.342
I... I'm too busy juggling Graham

05:13.444 --> 05:15.044
and my full-time job and all my hobbies,

05:15.112 --> 05:16.945
like breathing and sleeping
and drinking water,

05:17.048 --> 05:19.248
so sometimes I pay a little more
for certain necessities.

05:19.283 --> 05:21.216
What kind of necessity? Like food?

05:21.318 --> 05:22.518
Delivery, yep.

05:22.620 --> 05:25.254
Lots of food delivery,
some expedited shipping.

05:25.322 --> 05:27.956
Maybe I'll park in a red zone
here or there or here again.

05:28.059 --> 05:30.572
But trust me, it's all
very, very necessary.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.561
Uh-huh. Is it necessary to pay $8

05:32.663 --> 05:34.496
for a quart of gas station milk?

05:34.565 --> 05:37.099
If all I need is gas and milk,
I'm not making two stops.

05:37.201 --> 05:38.267
Yeah, but it's just not milk.

05:38.369 --> 05:39.601
You're paying gas station prices

05:39.670 --> 05:41.970
for toilet paper, batteries...

05:42.073 --> 05:43.138
salsa?

05:43.174 --> 05:44.573
Hey, when the grocery store
starts selling gas,

05:44.675 --> 05:46.642
they'll start seeing
my salsa dollars again.

05:46.744 --> 05:47.976
O-Okay, I can't take this anymore.

05:48.045 --> 05:51.380
I'm gonna show you how to turn
your "convenience tax"

05:51.482 --> 05:52.648
into hockey pads.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.383
But I'm gonna have to
take over your life.

05:54.485 --> 05:55.951
Fine. My life is all yours.

05:56.053 --> 05:57.720
But I must warn you...

05:57.788 --> 05:58.954
there's this guy in my life

05:59.056 --> 06:01.223
that's gonna be a real pain in your ass.

06:01.325 --> 06:03.459
His name is Douglas.

06:03.561 --> 06:05.527
You worked hard for that one.

06:05.596 --> 06:07.529
I'm gonna let you enjoy it.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.166
All right, did two laps...

06:11.268 --> 06:12.901
a counterclockwise and a clockwise.

06:13.003 --> 06:14.578
I just don't want
to overdevelop one thigh.

06:14.633 --> 06:16.430
Well, I hope those
symmetrical thighs are ready

06:16.474 --> 06:18.474
to sit down and have lunch
with an adoring fan,

06:18.509 --> 06:20.375
because you are getting a lot of bids.

06:20.478 --> 06:22.111
Really? I am?

06:22.213 --> 06:23.245
Oh, that's such a relief.

06:23.314 --> 06:25.331
Okay, so, how much am I going for?

06:25.440 --> 06:27.549
Three figures? Four?
What's the gender breakdown?

06:27.618 --> 06:29.017
You know what? La, la, la, la, la, la!

06:29.120 --> 06:30.853
I don't want to know.

06:30.955 --> 06:32.454
- Lap.
- That's a good idea.

06:34.191 --> 06:36.825
He hasn't gotten a single bid.
What if we change it to

06:36.927 --> 06:38.660
"Lunch and Hike with KZOP's Will Cooper,

06:38.729 --> 06:40.262
Who Will Also Hand Detail Your Car"?

06:40.364 --> 06:42.100
Or "Lunch and a dot, dot, dot,
question mark"?

06:42.186 --> 06:43.472
Kind of implying
that it starts with lunch,

06:43.567 --> 06:45.000
but where it goes from there
is unwritten.

06:45.102 --> 06:46.902
Ew! You're talking about my father.

06:47.004 --> 06:48.070
Sorry. It's just really easy

06:48.172 --> 06:49.605
to forget that you're a child sometimes.

06:49.707 --> 06:51.206
I know.

06:51.308 --> 06:52.930
I'll just bid on him. Hm?

06:53.016 --> 06:54.782
No! That's a pity bid!

06:54.860 --> 06:56.376
We need a real person to win this thing.

06:56.447 --> 06:57.944
<i>Final bids, please.</i>

06:57.968 --> 06:58.982
- <i>Final bids.</i>
- Oh, God, I'm blanking!

06:59.007 --> 07:00.937
I can't think of a single
real person who isn't me.

07:00.999 --> 07:02.718
- Who should I put down?
- Someone who eats lunch

07:02.820 --> 07:04.987
and can act like a fan
of KZOP's Will Cooper.

07:05.089 --> 07:06.622
I don't know any actors!

07:06.724 --> 07:08.957
Actually...

07:09.059 --> 07:11.193
wait a minute.

07:12.263 --> 07:14.984
Dr. Biscuits, have I got a role for you.

07:15.064 --> 07:16.897
I'm listening.

07:20.922 --> 07:24.364
I'm sorry, Ms. Banks.
I won't play a fan.

07:24.435 --> 07:26.201
Oh, please, Dr. Biscuits. I...

07:26.270 --> 07:28.337
I will play a superfan!

07:28.372 --> 07:30.963
Thank you. Thank you so much.

07:31.057 --> 07:32.474
Now, his daughter goes to school here,

07:32.576 --> 07:33.742
so you've probably already met.

07:33.844 --> 07:35.344
But I was thinking that you could say...

07:35.412 --> 07:36.445
Ah, ah!

07:36.547 --> 07:38.747
I will work out
my own backstory, thank you.

07:38.816 --> 07:40.115
Okay. Sorry.

07:40.184 --> 07:42.284
Well, I guess all you need
to know is that his name is...

07:42.386 --> 07:43.452
Ah, ah!

07:43.487 --> 07:45.654
I will do my own research, thank you.

07:45.756 --> 07:47.489
Okay.

07:47.558 --> 07:49.458
Well, is there anything
you need from me at all or...

07:49.526 --> 07:52.261
I need an item of his clothing,
recently worn.

07:52.363 --> 07:53.428
Or a photograph.

07:53.530 --> 07:55.264
I got a photo of him on my phone.

07:55.366 --> 07:56.431
Please, print it out.

07:56.533 --> 07:58.867
Place it in an unmarked manilla envelope

07:58.936 --> 08:00.669
on the windscreen of the car

08:00.738 --> 08:01.937
bearing this bumper-plate number

08:02.006 --> 08:03.438
in precisely one week from today.

08:03.540 --> 08:04.506
There's a printer outside,

08:04.608 --> 08:05.607
so I'll just slide it under your door.

08:05.676 --> 08:07.042
Thank you so much.

08:09.213 --> 08:10.779
Very well!

08:10.881 --> 08:12.614
You know, when I was in med school,

08:12.683 --> 08:13.815
I always prided myself

08:13.918 --> 08:17.519
on being as fiscally anal as I was poor.

08:17.621 --> 08:20.322
They used to call me
"Nurse Spreadsheets."

08:20.391 --> 08:21.857
Ohhhhh!

08:21.926 --> 08:23.625
Right, my budget thing.

08:23.727 --> 08:26.862
For a second there, I totally
forgot why you were here.

08:26.964 --> 08:27.930
You want some coffee?

08:27.998 --> 08:28.997
I'd love coffee.

08:29.099 --> 08:30.632
Great.

08:34.571 --> 08:35.804
Thought we wanted coffee.

08:35.905 --> 08:37.172
We do.

08:37.274 --> 08:38.472
Yeah, coffee comes
from the coffee place.

08:38.575 --> 08:39.875
Yes, it does.

08:39.943 --> 08:43.078
Three times a day, at $6 a pop.

08:43.147 --> 08:45.681
Oh, hello, teachable moment.

08:47.451 --> 08:48.684
No. No!

08:48.786 --> 08:50.852
I-I-I... I need my coffee place.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.521
It's on the way from here to school

08:52.623 --> 08:54.022
and on the way from school to work

08:54.124 --> 08:55.557
and on the way from work to here.

08:55.626 --> 08:56.825
It's a miracle of geography,

08:56.894 --> 08:58.427
and it's what makes my life possible.

08:58.529 --> 09:00.929
Okay, well, look at this, huh?

09:01.999 --> 09:04.132
No, but this takes so long!

09:04.201 --> 09:07.347
And at my coffee place,
I have a barista, Trish,

09:07.438 --> 09:09.338
and she always has my latte
waiting for me.

09:09.406 --> 09:11.039
I'm your Trish now.

09:13.110 --> 09:16.111
You guys should be free to roll
around on the floor of my car.

09:16.213 --> 09:17.546
We're breaking their spirit!

09:17.614 --> 09:19.314
Pennies belong in a bank...

09:19.350 --> 09:22.184
or dumped in a tube sock
and used for self-defense.

09:22.286 --> 09:24.853
Hockey pads, hockey pads,

09:24.922 --> 09:26.455
h-h-hockey pads.

09:26.523 --> 09:28.423
Six pairs of the same sunglasses?

09:28.525 --> 09:29.691
I'm gonna lose half of them.

09:29.793 --> 09:31.526
You always have
more sunglasses than you need

09:31.595 --> 09:33.128
because some of them
aren't gonna make it.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.796
Like with babies
at the turn of the century.

09:40.904 --> 09:42.571
You did a great job.

09:43.741 --> 09:45.707
Okay.

09:45.776 --> 09:47.376
Thank you.

09:49.113 --> 09:51.013
Just gonna be you today, champ?

09:51.038 --> 09:51.991
Champ?!

09:52.016 --> 09:53.048
Don't you know who this is?

09:53.150 --> 09:54.983
This is KZOP's Will Cooper!

09:55.019 --> 09:57.152
Now, how about you get us
the two most expensive things

09:57.254 --> 09:58.353
on the menu?

09:58.422 --> 09:59.888
Both for him. I'm too nervous to eat.

10:00.891 --> 10:01.790
- Dr. Biscuits?
- Yes.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.058
I didn't know you were a fan.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.526
- I'm not.
- Oh.

10:04.628 --> 10:06.028
I'm a superfan.

10:07.331 --> 10:09.064
But at school, you've never mentioned...

10:09.166 --> 10:10.198
Oh! I don't care about me.

10:10.300 --> 10:11.500
I care about three things...

10:11.602 --> 10:14.179
you, the weather, and
where they overlap. Go.

10:14.204 --> 10:15.537
All right.

10:15.639 --> 10:17.406
Where would you like to start?

10:17.474 --> 10:19.374
Denver Presbyterian Hospital,

10:19.443 --> 10:22.711
May 6, 1983, 8:45 A.M.

10:22.813 --> 10:25.614
Bud and Lucile Cooper
welcome into the world

10:25.682 --> 10:28.750
a beautiful 7-pound, 5-ounce baby boy.

10:28.819 --> 10:32.020
The high was 68, the low, 40.

10:32.122 --> 10:35.624
- With a mild chance of hail.
- Mild chance of hail.

10:35.726 --> 10:36.825
Wow.

10:36.894 --> 10:38.894
Never stop talking to me.

10:40.364 --> 10:42.297
Oh. Come on in.

10:42.383 --> 10:43.932
But please, keep your shoes on.

10:44.001 --> 10:46.001
I've just always wanted to say that.

10:46.103 --> 10:47.069
Refresh my memory.

10:47.171 --> 10:48.570
Who did you say outbid me for the beret?

10:48.672 --> 10:51.440
Anonymous. They're... anonymous.

10:51.542 --> 10:53.708
Why would someone
who wanted to remain anonymous

10:53.811 --> 10:56.478
buy the most eye-catching hat
civilization has ever produced?

10:56.580 --> 10:58.213
- They wouldn't.
- Doesn't add up.

10:58.315 --> 10:59.448
Easy.

10:59.516 --> 11:02.098
See, they're shy with names
but not with hats.

11:02.168 --> 11:05.520
- You feel me?
- Or they want to get caught.

11:05.622 --> 11:06.888
Care to explain what you're doing here,

11:06.990 --> 11:08.790
other than dying of thirst?

11:09.493 --> 11:10.992
Miggy, why would you do this?

11:11.061 --> 11:12.599
'Cause you said I have no taste.

11:12.709 --> 11:14.429
I should've known.
Curse of the trendsetter...

11:14.531 --> 11:16.990
everything you love
will be ruined by normos.

11:17.053 --> 11:18.066
Find her!

11:18.135 --> 11:19.232
Remember our orders!

11:19.303 --> 11:21.269
The beret must not be harmed!

11:24.541 --> 11:25.640
Daah!

11:25.709 --> 11:26.942
Oh! Oh, God!

11:27.044 --> 11:28.777
Oh! No, please!

11:28.879 --> 11:29.845
Ah!

11:29.913 --> 11:31.079
Ah! I tap.

11:31.181 --> 11:32.647
I tap!

11:37.354 --> 11:38.620
Next time, I won't be so kind.

11:38.689 --> 11:39.888
Thank you?

11:44.361 --> 11:47.896
Thief! You suck! That beret needs me!

11:47.965 --> 11:49.064
Let's get to work.

11:49.166 --> 11:52.033
I'll get it back!
You don't deserve that beret!

11:52.136 --> 11:53.702
Sleep with your eyes open!

11:53.737 --> 11:56.905
I still don't understand.
Dad knows Dr. Biscuits.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.974
- Is he in a disguise?
- Nope.

11:59.076 --> 12:00.775
Costume, maybe. Could be some props.

12:00.844 --> 12:02.477
But Biscuits is playing himself...

12:02.579 --> 12:04.779
just himself as a Will Cooper superfan.

12:04.848 --> 12:06.748
Biscuits is an amazing actor.

12:06.850 --> 12:08.483
- What's he been in?
- I don't know.

12:08.585 --> 12:09.818
Good evening.

12:09.887 --> 12:11.686
Yes... Will Cooper.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.687
I know.

12:12.712 --> 12:13.632
Hey, Poppy.

12:13.657 --> 12:14.856
Bloody Mary with bacon

12:14.958 --> 12:17.359
and a tiny burger on the straw.

12:17.461 --> 12:18.560
We don't have those.

12:18.629 --> 12:20.428
Can't believe I used to come here.

12:20.531 --> 12:23.899
- So... fun lunch?
- Fun?

12:23.967 --> 12:25.834
Um, it was revelatory.

12:27.004 --> 12:28.470
Oh, no.

12:28.572 --> 12:30.205
I've been spotted.

12:31.575 --> 12:32.494
Hey.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.142
You're why I do it.

12:35.746 --> 12:38.090
Okay, you weren't kidding about
your dad's self-esteem pendulum.

12:38.184 --> 12:40.182
One lunch, and now
he's ordering straw burgers?

12:40.284 --> 12:42.350
I'm starting to think this
Biscuits thing was a mistake.

12:42.452 --> 12:44.519
- Well, there's no going back now.
- Why not?

12:44.588 --> 12:46.087
Do you not understand pendulums?

12:46.190 --> 12:47.656
If my dad finds out the truth,

12:47.724 --> 12:50.292
he'll swing back even harder
in the other direction.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.127
He could turn in his trench coat

12:52.229 --> 12:53.628
and leave the weather biz forever.

12:53.697 --> 12:55.697
Trench coat? Who's still
wearing trench coats?

12:55.799 --> 12:57.165
He needs to get rid of that anyway.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.367
- You guys whispering about me?
- Yes, yes.

12:59.436 --> 13:01.069
Great. Let's keep the convo
there and drill down.

13:01.171 --> 13:04.184
See, the thing about me is,
I don't have a fan.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.200
I have a superfan!

13:06.343 --> 13:08.276
In fact, I have a lot of them.

13:08.378 --> 13:10.551
They have a group text.
Guess what they text about.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.215
Me! People love me!

13:13.283 --> 13:15.917
But for some reason,
I still don't have my own office

13:16.019 --> 13:17.552
and I have to park in the overflow lot

13:17.588 --> 13:20.622
and I was bumped from the promo
for a cartoon sun.

13:20.691 --> 13:21.823
You know what?

13:21.925 --> 13:25.393
I'm gonna call KZOP right now,
and I am going to demand

13:25.495 --> 13:26.795
that they re-shoot the promo

13:26.863 --> 13:29.264
and give my superfans what they want...

13:29.289 --> 13:30.265
me!

13:30.290 --> 13:32.067
And if they say no, I'll quit.

13:32.169 --> 13:33.835
Sophie!

13:33.937 --> 13:36.605
Great. Now Tracy Fries is gonna
have a missed call from me.

13:36.707 --> 13:38.240
How am I gonna explain that?

13:40.244 --> 13:41.343
I'm sorry, Dad.

13:41.411 --> 13:43.979
But your superfan, he's...

13:44.881 --> 13:46.047
...not real.

13:48.151 --> 13:51.253
Will, I wrote Biscuits' name
down in a panic,

13:51.355 --> 13:53.588
and I asked him to play
the role of your superfan.

13:53.690 --> 13:55.423
I am so sorry.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.060
Oh. I see.

13:59.162 --> 14:01.296
Well, I have just gone

14:01.398 --> 14:06.601
from experiencing a high of euphoria

14:06.703 --> 14:08.003
to a low...

14:08.105 --> 14:09.237
of now.

14:10.707 --> 14:12.274
Back to you, Julie.

14:16.813 --> 14:18.013
Tracy Fries?

14:18.115 --> 14:19.914
Yeah, yeah, no, I called.

14:19.983 --> 14:23.585
Just to say how much I've been
enjoying the overflow lot.

14:23.687 --> 14:25.587
Nah, it couldn't wait.

14:25.689 --> 14:27.389
Ugh. What a day!

14:27.491 --> 14:28.823
I can't believe how much money

14:28.892 --> 14:30.625
I was giving that kid next door
to take my trash cans in.

14:30.727 --> 14:32.495
Yeah, it felt good to make him cry.

14:32.542 --> 14:35.130
Now that he's off the books,
Graham can play hockey...

14:35.232 --> 14:37.532
in pads that he'll outgrow in a month.

14:37.601 --> 14:40.869
Douglas, I could never have
done this without you...

14:40.971 --> 14:42.370
forcing me to do this.

14:42.399 --> 14:43.422
Thank you.

14:47.978 --> 14:49.778
Welcome to my home. How may I help you?

14:49.880 --> 14:51.346
Angie.

14:51.448 --> 14:53.048
W-What's happening?

14:53.116 --> 14:54.783
I ordered you a treat to say thank you

14:54.885 --> 14:57.118
for teaching me how to be
financially responsible.

14:58.722 --> 15:00.962
- How much were these?
- It's not important.

15:01.032 --> 15:02.324
- $28.
- Wh... ah...

15:02.426 --> 15:05.193
I-I'm not eating a $14 cupcake!

15:05.295 --> 15:06.328
We want to return those.

15:06.430 --> 15:07.662
Have you learned nothing?!

15:07.764 --> 15:09.064
Relax, Douglas.

15:09.166 --> 15:11.232
We made so much money today!

15:11.335 --> 15:13.868
I-I slashed my convenience tax
burden in half.

15:13.970 --> 15:16.237
There should be
no convenience tax burden.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.340
The convenience tax is you being lazy.

15:19.910 --> 15:22.143
Okay, rich white man

15:22.245 --> 15:24.179
with an in-home sauna
who works three days a week.

15:24.281 --> 15:25.560
I'm lazy?

15:25.646 --> 15:28.183
Okay, you're on your own.
Go back to farting away your money.

15:28.251 --> 15:29.517
Fine! I will, then!

15:29.619 --> 15:31.419
Not the farting part,
but the "being on my own" part.

15:31.521 --> 15:32.821
I don't need your help.

15:33.924 --> 15:35.557
Excuse me.

15:35.659 --> 15:37.354
Did a dude named Ken used to live here?

15:37.427 --> 15:38.789
- Get out.
- 'Cause I've seen that wall before,

15:38.844 --> 15:39.961
I think.

15:41.000 --> 15:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:54.954 --> 15:55.982
Mmm.

15:56.048 --> 15:58.415
I wouldn't pay $14 for you,

15:58.483 --> 16:01.515
but you drop your price to $12,
it's a conversation.

16:02.470 --> 16:04.387
Douglas!

16:05.576 --> 16:07.109
My car got towed.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.175
I finally got you to park legally.

16:09.222 --> 16:10.543
I watched with my own eyes

16:10.612 --> 16:12.979
as you parked by a curb
that wasn't a color!

16:13.081 --> 16:15.181
I may have some
outstanding parking tickets.

16:15.250 --> 16:18.218
And I mean "outstanding" as in "unpaid"

16:18.320 --> 16:20.019
and also as in "I illegally parked

16:20.122 --> 16:21.588
in some really cool places."

16:21.690 --> 16:24.324
Does your happiness go up
with my blood pressure?

16:24.393 --> 16:27.227
All right, I'll give you a ride
to the impound lot.

16:27.329 --> 16:29.295
No, I'm gonna call an Uber.
It's surge pricing now, but...

16:29.398 --> 16:31.231
- No!
- All right, look.

16:31.299 --> 16:32.499
I'm sorry, okay?

16:32.601 --> 16:34.701
I-I know my convenience tax is nuts.

16:34.803 --> 16:36.169
It's just...

16:36.238 --> 16:38.571
if I wait in a long line
at the post office

16:38.640 --> 16:40.573
or drive all the way
to the bargain mall,

16:40.609 --> 16:42.542
it's less time
I get to spend with Graham.

16:42.611 --> 16:45.278
He was just born. Now he's 8.

16:45.380 --> 16:48.381
And before I know it,
he'll be 18, and...

16:48.483 --> 16:49.716
then that's it.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.886
I already had money
when I became a single parent,

16:52.954 --> 16:55.822
and it still felt impossible.

16:55.891 --> 16:58.625
I honestly don't know how you do it.

16:58.727 --> 17:00.126
But it amazes me.

17:01.897 --> 17:02.929
Oh, boy.

17:03.031 --> 17:03.930
Ohhh!

17:04.031 --> 17:05.198
All right, that'll... that'll do.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.200
Let's go.

17:07.269 --> 17:09.803
Hey, do you think if I give
that speech at the impound lot,

17:09.871 --> 17:11.404
they'll just give me my car back?

17:11.506 --> 17:12.972
Well, can you make yourself cry?

17:13.074 --> 17:14.273
Mm, might need a little help.

17:14.376 --> 17:16.286
- Can you get me there?
- Oh, yeah.

17:21.983 --> 17:24.217
Will, I am so sorry.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.219
In retrospect,
I shouldn't have hired an actor

17:26.320 --> 17:27.454
to protect your feelings.

17:27.521 --> 17:29.055
But in my defense, I didn't know

17:29.157 --> 17:30.857
Biscuits had that kind
of performance in him.

17:30.959 --> 17:32.192
He really took you on a journey!

17:32.294 --> 17:33.560
He really did.

17:33.662 --> 17:36.029
But it was a journey I was so
pathetically desperate to go on,

17:36.097 --> 17:37.597
it turned me into a monster.

17:37.699 --> 17:40.867
A Bloody Mary with bacon,
tiny burger on the straw?

17:40.969 --> 17:42.535
Pfft. Who did I think I was?

17:42.604 --> 17:45.238
French meteorologist Didier Marceau?

17:47.075 --> 17:49.042
I was stupid to think
I would have a fan,

17:49.144 --> 17:50.577
let alone a superfan.

17:50.679 --> 17:51.511
Dad.

17:51.580 --> 17:53.947
Do you like doing the weather?

17:54.049 --> 17:55.281
I love it.

17:55.383 --> 17:57.817
Then it doesn't matter
if you don't have a superfan.

17:57.919 --> 18:00.720
It doesn't matter
if you never have a superfan.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.856
Only one person's opinion matters.

18:02.924 --> 18:05.191
French meteorologist Didier Marceau's?

18:05.293 --> 18:07.160
No. Yours.

18:08.196 --> 18:09.232
That is wise.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.697
Thank you.

18:11.733 --> 18:14.267
You really think
I'll never have a superfan?

18:14.369 --> 18:16.002
No, I take that part back.

18:16.071 --> 18:19.038
You will always, always have
at least one superfan.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.106
Ruin this moment by saying

18:20.208 --> 18:21.751
"French meteorologist Didier Marceau,"

18:21.776 --> 18:22.786
and I will knock you out.

18:22.811 --> 18:23.750
Yes, ma'am.

18:24.846 --> 18:25.922
Mother, I told you,

18:25.947 --> 18:27.981
I don't know what happened
to the hot-glue gun.

18:28.049 --> 18:29.682
- Pbbbbt.
- Oh. You.

18:29.784 --> 18:30.884
Come to ransack my wardrobe

18:30.986 --> 18:32.548
or just assume my identity altogether?

18:32.611 --> 18:34.687
No! I want to apologize.

18:34.789 --> 18:37.423
Look, I was hurt
when you insulted my taste.

18:37.526 --> 18:39.659
There was a time where I didn't
even have to think about it.

18:39.728 --> 18:42.462
I was just cool. I had the trip.
And now...

18:42.531 --> 18:44.330
- Fatherhood has softened your edge?
- Hey.

18:44.432 --> 18:46.132
Sorry, but it has.

18:46.234 --> 18:47.400
And everyone knows it.

18:47.502 --> 18:49.369
I thought this beret was the solution.

18:49.471 --> 18:51.271
I don't know how I got it so wrong.

18:51.373 --> 18:53.206
Buying a used hat at a school auction

18:53.274 --> 18:54.696
really seemed like a silver bullet.

18:54.774 --> 18:58.011
No. My fashion critiques have
been described as "withering."

18:58.079 --> 18:59.662
- True.
- I need to learn to rein it in.

18:59.687 --> 19:00.710
Friends?

19:02.017 --> 19:03.116
Friends.

19:03.184 --> 19:05.652
So, I was thinking
we can share the beret.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.163
It's with you Monday, Wednesday, Friday

19:07.188 --> 19:08.788
and with me Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.189
On Sundays, we alternate.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.473
- Now, vacations might be a little tou...
- Wait. Stop.

19:12.561 --> 19:14.027
Put the beret on. It's yours.

19:14.129 --> 19:16.796
- Oh. Really?
- Yeah.

19:16.898 --> 19:19.666
- Wow! It looks good on you!
- Thank you.

19:19.768 --> 19:21.434
And sure, berets are on-trend now,

19:21.536 --> 19:22.969
but I got to keep moving.

19:24.372 --> 19:25.585
The beret of the heartland.

19:26.675 --> 19:28.641
Well, now I want a cowboy hat.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.077
Trish, this is goodbye.

19:31.179 --> 19:32.912
From now on, I'll be making coffee,

19:32.981 --> 19:35.348
like I'm running
a freakin' A.A. meeting.

19:35.417 --> 19:37.083
So, if I come in here,

19:37.152 --> 19:38.685
I'm gonna need you to help me be strong

19:38.787 --> 19:40.019
and not sell me coffee.

19:40.121 --> 19:41.988
Can you promise me that?

19:42.057 --> 19:43.856
No.

19:43.925 --> 19:46.192
I'd get in trouble for
refusing coffee to a customer.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.294
I guess that's fair.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.663
And even if nobody knew, I would know.

19:50.765 --> 19:53.967
And ultimately, we're all
responsible to ourselves, Angie.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.602
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ask you

19:55.627 --> 19:56.806
to compromise your beliefs.

19:56.868 --> 19:59.486
To say nothing of the promise
I've made to our shareholders. I mean...

19:59.556 --> 20:01.189
You know, getting out
of this conversation

20:01.263 --> 20:03.579
is worth $100 to me.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.191
- Convenience tax.
- Convenience tax.

20:10.472 --> 20:13.987
I drove all the way down
to the bargain mall for this.

20:14.042 --> 20:16.317
Oh, no! Is the mail broken?

20:16.427 --> 20:17.495
No.

20:17.594 --> 20:21.043
But thanks to Douglas,
Mommy's making some changes.

20:21.097 --> 20:23.816
What's all this armor for?

20:23.894 --> 20:25.683
For you, to play hockey.

20:25.731 --> 20:27.666
Ohhhhh.

20:28.653 --> 20:30.261
<i>This</i> is hockey.

20:30.339 --> 20:32.493
I got it confused with the other one.

20:32.594 --> 20:34.829
I don't want to do hockey.

20:34.867 --> 20:35.815
What?

20:35.840 --> 20:37.229
No. Yeah, you do.

20:37.291 --> 20:39.393
I want to do the one where you dive.

20:39.494 --> 20:41.263
What's the one where you dive called?

20:41.363 --> 20:42.364
Diving?

20:42.466 --> 20:43.900
Yup. That's the one.

20:43.933 --> 20:45.869
You sure you're thinking about <i> diving?</i>

20:45.971 --> 20:47.973
You're not thinking of, like, fencing?

20:48.074 --> 20:51.379
- Nope.
- Great. I'll just...

20:51.479 --> 20:53.649
give you one of my bikini bottoms.

20:55.994 --> 20:59.031
Fencing <i> does</i> sound fun.
