-MAN 1: Hey, let me see that.

00:08.843 --> 00:11.004
MAN 2: See what?
MAN 1: The lever.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.341
MAN 2: Why?
MAN 1: It's mine, isn't it?

00:15.349 --> 00:16.555
MAN 2: Yeah, it's yours.

00:16.642 --> 00:19.224
MAN 1: Son of a...
MAN 2: What?

00:19.312 --> 00:20.301
MAN 2: What?
MAN 1: Yeah.

00:30.489 --> 00:32.070
(WHIRRING CONTINUES)

00:32.158 --> 00:35.116
-MAN 1: Where are the latches?
-(CHUCKLES) Wow!

00:36.579 --> 00:39.571
Hey, ain't seen your mother in years.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.493
(LAUGHS)

00:46.047 --> 00:48.129
All right, Frankie,
half the job's done.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.672
The other half will be complete
by tomorrow.

00:49.759 --> 00:51.545
All right.
Projectors work in all of them?

00:51.636 --> 00:52.625
Locked and loaded.

00:52.970 --> 00:55.586
-You get the other half tomorrow.
-All right.

00:55.681 --> 00:57.592
Hey, hey, hey, hey, come here.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.639
Do me a favor?

00:59.727 --> 01:02.059
Load this one up
for me personally, all right?

01:02.146 --> 01:03.647
This one right here.

01:05.441 --> 01:06.942
Hey, big man.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.266
Hey.

01:08.361 --> 01:10.773
So, you get the coin take from Hodas

01:10.863 --> 01:12.649
and walked it over to Carlos, right?

01:12.740 --> 01:15.322
-How much this week?
-Four to Rudy.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.786
All this should bump that up
real nice, though.

01:18.496 --> 01:20.077
They said it's gonna be
done by tomorrow.

01:21.457 --> 01:23.539
Hey, come here.

01:25.711 --> 01:29.374
Now, I figure you should be
the one to christen it.

01:29.465 --> 01:31.001
I mean, after all...

01:31.092 --> 01:32.457
(COINS JANGLING)

01:33.636 --> 01:35.172
Go on.

01:36.514 --> 01:38.129
Oh! Not that one.

01:38.224 --> 01:39.634
This one over here.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.636
Yeah, this one works.

01:41.727 --> 01:43.979
This one works real, real good.

01:45.314 --> 01:47.100
Now, you're gonna want
some privacy, big man.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.274
(WHIRRING)

01:54.365 --> 01:56.071
(CHUCKLES)

01:56.158 --> 01:57.614
Now, I know your cock justjumped

01:57.702 --> 01:59.567
right into your hand, Mikey.

01:59.662 --> 02:01.402
There's no way it didn't.

02:01.497 --> 02:02.907
(FRANKIE CHUCKLES)

02:03.833 --> 02:05.789
(CHUCKLES) Man.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.753
Because you dreamed it, big man.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.205
Because you dreamed it.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.919
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

03:47.561 --> 03:49.938
So, I've been approaching it
scientifically as of late.

03:50.022 --> 03:52.684
-Why not, right?
-Better porno through science?

03:53.442 --> 03:55.979
No, I'm not kidding.
Come here. Take a look.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.480
See, past couple of months,

03:57.571 --> 03:59.607
I've been sorting the quarters
from each machine separately.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.734
Now, I know what film
I'm running on each machine

04:01.826 --> 04:03.532
and I never mix it up
before we do the weight.

04:03.619 --> 04:06.110
Starting to give me
a real sense of what stuff

04:06.205 --> 04:08.036
is bringing in the most quarters,
know what I mean?

04:08.124 --> 04:09.830
-Right.
-Yeah. Come on.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.337
This is your cheat sheet.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.711
Consider straight fucking and sucking
to be a baseline.

04:19.802 --> 04:21.167
Brings in coin, no problem.

04:21.262 --> 04:22.968
But lesbian sex?

04:23.055 --> 04:25.137
That's a punch
way above its weight class.

04:25.224 --> 04:29.058
-Lesbians?
-Yeah, cash cows, so to speak.

04:29.145 --> 04:30.851
-What else?
-Black on white.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.348
Interracial.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.351
Not so much the black girls
with the white guys.

04:34.442 --> 04:35.727
Vice versa.

04:35.818 --> 04:36.933
The bigger the dick, the better.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.403
That sells, huh?

04:38.487 --> 04:39.897
Yeah, I had a couple of new machines

04:39.989 --> 04:42.105
over on 8th Avenue,
the ones with the doors,

04:42.199 --> 04:44.531
so nobody can see what particular kink
you got going on.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.529
Showing only black on white.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.736
(SCOFFS) Those guys made
more money at the end of the month

04:48.831 --> 04:49.911
than anybody else on the Deuce.

04:49.999 --> 04:51.614
I also got some Danish loops

04:51.709 --> 04:53.040
showing on some new machines.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.913
Now, I couldn't put
the labels on those machines

04:55.004 --> 04:57.290
because the cops would've
lost their minds and confiscated them.

04:57.381 --> 04:59.292
But the customers
found them just the same.

04:59.383 --> 05:00.372
Dogs.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.799
Dogs?

05:02.428 --> 05:03.838
And one horse, actually.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.544
Look, I know it's crazy,

05:05.639 --> 05:08.472
but they can shoot that stuff
over in Denmark.

05:08.559 --> 05:10.550
Actually, it was more
of a jerk-off scene than fucking.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.896
Yeah, well, with a horse,
I'd think so.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.561
(ALL LAUGHING)

05:14.648 --> 05:16.479
Now, me, personally, I don't draw

05:16.567 --> 05:18.353
any inspiration
from the real rough stuff,

05:18.444 --> 05:19.934
but there are customers that do.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.904
I think I know why. Wanna guess?

05:27.036 --> 05:29.118
Hmm? Guess?

05:29.205 --> 05:30.991
Yeah, I'll take a guess.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.281
Um...

05:34.585 --> 05:35.791
Well, because all these guys

05:35.878 --> 05:38.039
have been taught that women could
take it or leave it

05:38.130 --> 05:39.586
when it comes to sex.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.415
That we make choices,

05:42.510 --> 05:44.717
that we're particular.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.135
They see some pretty little white girl

05:47.223 --> 05:49.464
fucking some big, rough black guy,

05:49.558 --> 05:53.016
and it says, "No, women
are just as sex-crazed as they are."

05:53.646 --> 05:57.264
That we have no inhibitions
like they wish we had no inhibitions.

05:57.358 --> 06:00.600
"Shit, fellas, we'll even fuck the dog
when you're not looking."

06:01.570 --> 06:03.777
I mean, that's the fantasy, right?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.980
That's the shit we're selling here.

06:09.161 --> 06:10.947
| see why you brought her here.

06:13.249 --> 06:16.036
I saw that scene you did
in the wedding gown.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.500
Very notable.

06:22.925 --> 06:25.086
Still think you got
the pick of the litter, son?

06:25.177 --> 06:27.839
Man, I like her look.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.421
0.0.: For real?
The bitch is strung out.

06:30.516 --> 06:31.596
l'ma handle that.

06:31.684 --> 06:32.719
You'll see.

06:32.810 --> 06:35.893
Shit, I would've jumped
on Melissa first.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.596
But three women
is more than enough trouble.

06:38.691 --> 06:39.976
No need for four.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.773
I let C.C. beat me to her.

06:42.278 --> 06:43.313
Oh, you let me?

06:43.404 --> 06:45.235
Nah, see the hole in the fence?

06:45.739 --> 06:47.946
-Shit fucks me up.
-What? Her teeth?

06:48.033 --> 06:49.773
Yeah, the gap.

06:49.868 --> 06:50.903
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

06:51.453 --> 06:54.445
Oh, man, that shit is hot, man.

06:54.540 --> 06:57.998
Like that model, that Revlon bitch
in the football movie.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.248
Oh, yeah, that's some
girl-next-door action right there.

07:02.214 --> 07:03.829
Reggie just didn't know
how to present the bitch,

07:03.924 --> 07:04.959
-that's all.
-Yeah?

07:05.050 --> 07:07.462
Need to go the other way with her.
All farm girl and shit, you know?

07:07.553 --> 07:08.838
Fuck the boots and minis.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.170
Sell her ass in calico dresses.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.971
Like she just rode through
the Lincoln Tunnel

07:13.058 --> 07:14.719
-on a covered wagon and shit.
-(LAUGH|NG)

07:14.810 --> 07:16.095
Mmm-hmm. | see that.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.892
Yeah, bet, son. Melissa's gonna earn.

07:17.980 --> 07:21.097
-| see it.
-For real, Reggie had that wrong.

07:21.191 --> 07:24.103
Reggie Love had a few things wrong,
come to think of it.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.403
Man died right there on the floor.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.326
Stretched out on them greasy tiles,

07:31.410 --> 07:33.571
still talking shit to a smoking .44.

07:33.662 --> 07:34.902
Now, how you know he died talking?

07:34.997 --> 07:37.204
-Motherfucker never shut the fuck up.
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)

07:37.291 --> 07:38.872
Till he dead.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.251
Thing is, though...

07:46.342 --> 07:48.424
There's gotta be more game out there
than this, you know?

07:48.510 --> 07:49.886
Yo, think of what we have, Larry.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.632
The cars, the bitches, the vines.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.588
Wouldn't trade it for the world.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.298
Neither would I.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.305
Yeah.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.315
Yeah.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.561
As good as Les Matthews?

08:09.657 --> 08:11.022
Well, he read it over my shoulder

08:11.116 --> 08:13.823
and vouched for it, so be proud.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.403
Wait, you're starting
the story inside?

08:17.498 --> 08:18.487
You're notjumping?

08:18.582 --> 08:20.288
We'll tease it off the front.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.415
Tease it?

08:22.503 --> 08:25.586
(CHUCKLES) How are you gonna tease
an expose of police corruption?

08:25.673 --> 08:27.288
You've got me holding
the Lindsay administration

08:27.383 --> 08:28.372
complicit in the lead.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.503
No, you have that.

08:30.594 --> 08:33.210
We called the lawyers and they told us
we had to re-top the story.

08:33.305 --> 08:34.385
You called the lawyers?

08:34.473 --> 08:36.805
Yeah, it has to run
as a straight feature now.

08:36.892 --> 08:40.100
Life on the street. The girls,
the pimps, the human aspect.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.688
You cut out everything
about the protection?

08:41.772 --> 08:44.309
About the parlors
operating in plain sight?

08:44.400 --> 08:46.231
We've called out
city corruption before.

08:46.318 --> 08:47.558
You named names.

08:47.653 --> 08:50.269
The precinct commanders,
the property owners,

08:50.364 --> 08:52.150
and lawyers off the corporate papers.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.653
-l have sources.
-Unnamed sources

-No corroboration.
-WOMAN: Amsterdam News.

08:58.831 --> 09:01.288
Either get people on the record
or get some documents.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.081
So, all these months, and in the end,

09:03.168 --> 09:04.999
you're just gonna run a sob story

09:05.087 --> 09:07.294
about the poor street waifs
and their hardhearted pimps?

09:07.381 --> 09:09.542
We weren't going to even
take that, remember?

09:09.633 --> 09:10.964
But you wrote the hell out of it.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.508
Like I said, be proud.

09:15.347 --> 09:18.134
ALSTON: Now, I'm thinking,
"Motherfucker, l'm short-timing,

-Bielski's with him.

09:40.622 --> 09:44.114
No rathole is too small
to be on the fucking pad.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.700
Everybody in the precinct pays.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.380
Sweeney has it locked down.

09:51.467 --> 09:53.003
Maybe.

09:54.678 --> 09:55.963
Maybe not for long.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.636
I'm saying I think
some shit is coming soon.

09:58.724 --> 10:01.887
I don't think us getting a new captain
is business as usual.

10:01.977 --> 10:04.935
-McDonagh?
-I think he's gonna houseclean.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.559
What do you mean you think?
He feel you out?

10:09.318 --> 10:11.058
(SIGHS)

10:11.153 --> 10:12.643
I'm just saying.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.979
I don't think we should get seen
with our hand out.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.565
And lwouldn't stand
too close to Sweeney

10:18.660 --> 10:20.161
or the other moneymakers.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.574
Well, thanks for the warning.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.246
What do you think we should do?

10:25.334 --> 10:26.744
Give the envelope back?

10:28.504 --> 10:30.290
What do you think?

10:30.380 --> 10:33.167
I think if we do that,
everyone in the house

10:33.258 --> 10:34.998
will think we're rat motherfuckers.

10:37.012 --> 10:38.377
Yeah.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.969
Take what comes,

10:43.060 --> 10:44.846
but show no ambition.

You dig?

slinging drinks in that shithole bar.

11:02.454 --> 11:03.910

11:11.338 --> 11:13.294
All right, you are now
officially christened

11:13.382 --> 11:14.747

Oh! Who had the honors?

11:17.219 --> 11:18.880
Suzi, the Oriental broad.

Oh, shit!

11:21.056 --> 11:22.842
The one that works at the bar?

11:22.933 --> 11:24.218
I didn't know she tricked.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.392
Look, gentlemen, can we get down
to business, please?

11:27.479 --> 11:28.810
Yeah, first I gotta know

11:28.897 --> 11:30.307
what the fuck's going on
with these walls.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.563
It's supposed to be a magic forest.

-Hmm?
-lt's from this play,

11:35.404 --> 11:36.689
Summer Night Dream.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.111
It was at one of the theaters on 41st

11:38.198 --> 11:39.813
and they were dumping this stuff.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.773
Black Frankie knows
a stagehand over there,

11:41.869 --> 11:43.234
so we got it for free.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.943
Looks better than an empty wall.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.289
Summer Night Dream ?

11:46.373 --> 11:47.829
Yeah, it's like a fantasy story.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.452
I even got some
of the costumes in the back,

11:49.543 --> 11:51.249
but nothing looks good on the girls.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.201
Some fairy shit and a donkey head.

11:53.297 --> 11:55.253
Fairy shit like homo?

11:55.340 --> 11:57.456
No, like fairy tale fairies.

12:01.305 --> 12:04.138
this is nice for the VIPs.
You did good with it.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.725
I especially like
the mirrors on the ceiling

12:05.809 --> 12:06.889
in the rooms.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.888
-Nice touch.
-That was me.

12:10.439 --> 12:12.179
What? It was.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.853
All right, no disrespect, Rudy,

12:15.944 --> 12:19.357
but I gotta get over to the bar,
get everything set up for the day.

12:19.448 --> 12:21.188
Vince don't even like
walking into this place.

12:21.283 --> 12:22.648
-Do you, brother?
-Hey, why don't you

12:22.743 --> 12:24.608
just shut the fuck up
already, all right?

12:25.370 --> 12:27.577
-Excuse me.
-RUDY: Okay, I called this meeting

12:27.664 --> 12:29.200
to make good on what I promised you,

12:29.291 --> 12:32.704
just like you made good
on what you all promised.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.250
That's your cut of my cut

12:34.338 --> 12:36.169
of the quarters from the peeps.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.042
Even if Hodas and them are stealing,

12:38.133 --> 12:40.044
we're still making money
hand over fist.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.342
Fist over fist. (WHISTLES)

12:43.096 --> 12:44.677
Oh!

12:44.765 --> 12:46.471
Nice.

12:46.558 --> 12:50.050
Add that to what you guys
took in last month on the parlor,

12:50.145 --> 12:52.056
and nobody in this room
goes home poor.

12:52.147 --> 12:53.808
Am I right?

12:53.899 --> 12:56.185
-Yeah.
-lt's like I told you, Vincent,

12:56.276 --> 12:58.062
I ain't greedy.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.269
You make money, | make money.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.950
We're good together.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.194
Take care of Suzi.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.027
Make sure she's available for me
anytime I drop by.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.861
And don't let her get
with any colored guys.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.572
They'll stretch her out.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.204

four or five large here

13:22.302 --> 13:23.587
-just from the peeps.
-FRANK|E: Yeah.

13:23.679 --> 13:25.169
After paying off Rudy and the cops,

13:25.263 --> 13:27.515
we pulled, like, $14-$15,000

13:27.599 --> 13:28.714
from the parlor last month.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.926
That's $20,000 in four weeks.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.308
Hey, wait for your cut.

13:39.403 --> 13:41.644
Just bring it by the bar. I gotta go.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.483
Too good for the pussy trade.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

14:40.005 --> 14:42.337
VINCENT: What the fuck
is going on here?

14:42.424 --> 14:44.540
We thought we'd play some live music.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.091
You decided? In my bar?

14:47.179 --> 14:49.135
Paul and me.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.723
The band's playing
for their drinks only

14:50.807 --> 14:52.183
and they get to pass the hat,

14:52.267 --> 14:54.508
so what do we have to lose?

14:55.896 --> 14:59.059
And look, you packed the house.

14:59.149 --> 15:01.014
Yeah, don't look like
they're drinking much.

15:02.194 --> 15:04.651
Why's the singer got
all that shit on his face?

15:04.738 --> 15:07.070
I thought that went out
with AI Jolson.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.022
He's part black.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.070
Now I'm really confused.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.124
ABBY: You guys good here?
Another round?

15:20.212 --> 15:22.248
What's it all mean, Mike?

15:22.339 --> 15:23.499
I don't know.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.124
But I kind of dig it.

15:40.816 --> 15:42.977
Not your usual
guitar hero shit, right?

15:43.985 --> 15:47.648
I saw them playing this rent party
down on St. Mark's Place.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.320
The singer is wild.

15:49.407 --> 15:51.568
More velvet and street than Ziggy.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.366
It's different.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.989
Not really glam band.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.617
What'd you say?

15:58.708 --> 15:59.788
Glam band.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.741
Gang bang... Gang bang?

16:03.672 --> 16:04.912
Did you say gang bang?

16:05.006 --> 16:07.338
I'll be back!

to see run next week.

about the parlors and the payoffs?

My editor is saying no.

17:13.283 --> 17:14.648
Why no?

He says to name names like I want,

17:17.537 --> 17:19.744
I need my sources
to be named on the record.

17:20.624 --> 17:23.582
Either that or some proof on paper.

17:23.668 --> 17:25.704
A document or whatever.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.754
Well, I'm not a source.

17:31.676 --> 17:34.258
I think I made that clear.

17:34.346 --> 17:37.053
You cut out everything
that makes the city a part of it,

17:37.140 --> 17:38.505

you want here.

24:46.569 --> 24:49.026
You never said you had a brother.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.027
RUDY: We're looking to double
the floor space,

24:53.117 --> 24:56.780
so you're gonna need
to look at twice the layout.

24:56.871 --> 24:58.031
What says the foreman?

24:58.122 --> 24:59.658
-| see lots of possibilities.
-(DOOR OPENING)

25:00.333 --> 25:02.244
I can get us
the right guys for it, too.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.621
-What now?
-Hey, more business.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.577
I couldn't wait to show you guys.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.413
What more business?

25:08.508 --> 25:11.420
We got a lease on this whole place,
all three floors.

25:11.511 --> 25:13.047
And it's all cleared with the city.

25:13.137 --> 25:14.843
Gonna open another parlor
on the second floor,

25:14.931 --> 25:16.262
VIP room at the top.

25:16.349 --> 25:20.137
Yeah. Over here, wall-to-wall peeps.

25:20.228 --> 25:22.560
The new kind with the booths.

25:22.647 --> 25:24.057
-(LAUGHING)
-Oh, whoa!

25:24.148 --> 25:25.183
More fucking pussy?

25:25.274 --> 25:26.263
It's a bad thing?

25:26.359 --> 25:27.769
What, you don't think
there's a market?

25:27.860 --> 25:28.895
Fuck, Rudy.

25:29.737 --> 25:32.353
One day, I'm paying off
my brother's gambling debts.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.063
The next day,
my whole fucking family's

25:34.158 --> 25:37.525
neck-deep in running whores
and dirty fuck films.

25:37.620 --> 25:39.156
-The fuck?
-Hey,

25:39.247 --> 25:40.953
you don't want the opportunity,
I can...

25:41.040 --> 25:42.496
Hey, hey, hey, no.

25:42.583 --> 25:45.450
We want it, all right?
Vincent, come on.

25:45.545 --> 25:46.580
It ain't me, Rudy.

25:48.005 --> 25:50.712
-I'm out.
-Then you're out. Fuck you.

25:54.303 --> 25:55.509
Fuck me?

25:56.681 --> 25:57.761
Fuck me?

25:57.849 --> 26:00.761
Bobby, you should be on
a fucking construction site somewhere,

26:00.852 --> 26:02.638
not trying to run whorehouses.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.515
-Look at you.
-Look at me, yeah,

26:04.605 --> 26:07.347
with my wallet fat, bringing in
more money than the goddamn bar.

26:07.442 --> 26:09.023
Which is probably what's eating you.

26:12.196 --> 26:13.811
Fuck all of you.

26:15.116 --> 26:16.777
Fuck you,

26:16.868 --> 26:18.449
and fuck you!

26:19.871 --> 26:21.486
And, yeah, Mr. Pipilo,

26:21.581 --> 26:24.948
Rudy, respectfully, fuck you!

26:32.133 --> 26:33.623
He'll come around.

26:34.969 --> 26:37.881
Hey, let's go see the upstairs.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.225
CANDY: You got my letters, right?

26:47.398 --> 26:48.638
They were funny.

26:48.733 --> 26:50.473
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

26:50.568 --> 26:52.399
I read them a bunch.

26:54.405 --> 26:56.316
CANDY: Yeah, shit.

26:59.243 --> 27:00.904
I should've come by more often.

27:00.995 --> 27:02.860
I'm sorry.

27:04.874 --> 27:07.365
I just lost track of time.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.162
Hey, there are a couple of years there

27:12.256 --> 27:14.087
I don't even remember.

27:20.723 --> 27:22.384
That's not any better?

27:25.186 --> 27:26.517
I don't know.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.561
They say it is.

27:30.107 --> 27:33.190
Are they still doing
the electric shock stuff?

27:34.445 --> 27:35.855
No.

27:35.947 --> 27:37.778
Mostly meds for me now.

27:39.367 --> 27:41.198
I don't think
the shock treatment thing

27:41.285 --> 27:43.822
is something they want to do anymore.

27:45.331 --> 27:48.243
Dad was so quick
to sign off on that shit.

27:50.294 --> 27:52.330
-He thought it would help.
-Oh, fuck him.

27:52.421 --> 27:54.002
I hate him.

27:59.554 --> 28:01.260
The look on his face.

28:03.891 --> 28:05.847
Like I was gonna wear it out and...

28:05.977 --> 28:08.468
(BOTH LAUGHING)

28:08.563 --> 28:10.144
Walk down Queens Boulevard.

28:10.231 --> 28:12.597
Hey, that was
my fucking dress, remember?

28:14.360 --> 28:16.897
You could've gotten married in it
for all I cared.

28:17.947 --> 28:21.781
Leenie, the joke is
lwasn't even into that.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.409
I just tried it on for a laugh.

28:26.163 --> 28:28.074
Dad didn't laugh, though.

28:29.083 --> 28:31.620
Patrick, Dad doesn't
give a shit about you.

28:31.711 --> 28:33.247
Or me.

28:33.337 --> 28:34.998
Or who we are.

28:35.089 --> 28:38.081
He only cares about
how it might look to everyone else.

28:38.175 --> 28:40.211
How the rest of the world
might see him

28:40.303 --> 28:43.420
if his daughter gets knocked up,
if his son likes boys.

28:44.724 --> 28:46.134
Fuck him.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.511
Seriously, Patrick, who gives a fuck

28:48.603 --> 28:50.810
what Dad thinks about anything?

28:54.650 --> 28:56.311
I'm not homosexual.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.142
Patrick, come on.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.522
It's me.

28:59.614 --> 29:00.774
He knows I'm not.

29:00.865 --> 29:02.651
It's okay.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.858
He knows. The doctors, they know.

29:04.952 --> 29:06.692
Hey, I've known you
my whole goddamn life.

29:06.787 --> 29:08.118
I like girls.

29:08.205 --> 29:10.867
Name one girl you were ever with.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.338
Shit, I'm sorry.

29:24.013 --> 29:27.471
Patrick, the world...

29:29.644 --> 29:31.134
It's changing.

29:31.938 --> 29:34.179
And most people don't fuck with you,

29:34.273 --> 29:36.104
not like they used to.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.903
Dad would fucking hate it.

30:02.593 --> 30:03.799
PATRICK: Shit.

30:12.687 --> 30:14.427
(CHUCKUNG)

30:14.522 --> 30:15.932
VINCENT: You two are, what?

30:16.023 --> 30:18.059
Renewing your vows or something?

30:18.150 --> 30:20.812
My husband's taking me to Delmonico's.

30:20.903 --> 30:22.768
And then we're gonna go see Hair.

30:22.863 --> 30:24.239
Hippie shit.

30:27.034 --> 30:29.025
That a new ring, Fran?

30:29.120 --> 30:30.610
Bobby got it for me.

30:30.705 --> 30:32.445
It's aquamarine.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.030
Her birthstone.

30:37.086 --> 30:38.542
You two should get a room.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.120
So sue me for being happy.

30:42.675 --> 30:45.132
Heard from Andrea lately, Vince?

30:45.928 --> 30:47.043
No. Why?

30:50.099 --> 30:54.012
She, uh, came around
to our house this morning.

30:54.103 --> 30:55.309
She was pretty banged up.

30:55.396 --> 30:56.431
"Banged up"?

30:56.522 --> 30:58.353
Eddie Buccho, that son of a bitch.

30:58.441 --> 30:59.476
He beat her.

31:01.027 --> 31:03.734
-Eddie Buccho?
-All because of a pair of high heels.

31:03.821 --> 31:06.358
Yeah, he bought her
a pair of evening shoes from Saks.

31:06.449 --> 31:08.280
She didn't want to wear them
'cause they hurt her feet.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.607
And what's that loser do?

31:10.036 --> 31:11.526
He beats on her.

31:14.498 --> 31:15.874
Piece of shit.

31:16.542 --> 31:17.952
You know what the worst part is?

31:18.044 --> 31:20.285
-He did it in your house.
-What?

31:20.379 --> 31:21.585
In front of your kids.

but she ain't had nothing broke.

Fuck you can do, Vincent?

31:39.190 --> 31:40.305
Eddie's with Twist and them.

31:40.399 --> 31:41.809
You can't mess with that crew.

31:42.985 --> 31:44.646
You shouldn't have left Andrea.

31:44.737 --> 31:46.273
That's what your sister's telling you,

31:46.363 --> 31:47.773
bringing that news in here like that.

-You should go home.

about love and marriage?

-Hey.
-That ring you bought Fran?

I was in here the day that guy

31:56.665 --> 31:58.621
put all thatjewelry out on the bar.

31:58.709 --> 32:01.086
Couldn't help but notice
you bought two rings...

32:01.170 --> 32:02.660
One for your wife and one for...

32:03.130 --> 32:05.041
I'm guessing that blonde
who works the parlor.

32:06.008 --> 32:08.750
Her name's Tiffany. She's my friend.

-You know this guy?

A player I know hooked me up.

Said his man's cool.

and he was making a fuss,

34:34.281 --> 34:36.192
so we needed kind of a quiet space.

34:36.283 --> 34:37.693

thought about bringing him

34:37.785 --> 34:38.991
in the back, down the stairs.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.739
And you let them in?

We're on the same team, right?

37:55.607 --> 37:58.223
Oh, I slowed down.

37:58.318 --> 38:01.151
And my knees is all fucked up.

38:01.238 --> 38:02.774
I read the writing on the wall.

38:02.865 --> 38:04.275
Told me to pull back.

38:05.159 --> 38:06.444
What you mean?

38:07.703 --> 38:09.819
You operate on the Deuce, right?

38:11.457 --> 38:13.948
Take a look around, brother.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.078
Any man can drop
a quarter in a machine

38:16.170 --> 38:18.832
and pull on his rod
while he's watching people fuck.

38:20.007 --> 38:21.338
They do it in the movie theaters

38:21.425 --> 38:22.915
and every day of their lives.

38:24.136 --> 38:25.842
Man don't even have to ask a woman.

38:25.929 --> 38:28.090
She just drop her panties
and get into bed.

38:28.182 --> 38:31.265
Even ugly motherfuckers
don't have to pay for pussy no more.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.309
That's why they call it free love.

38:35.355 --> 38:37.687
Fuck. Listen, man.

38:39.443 --> 38:41.308
Always gonna be hoes, right?

38:42.237 --> 38:44.273
And they always gonna need a man

38:44.364 --> 38:45.945
to hold their money.

38:48.535 --> 38:50.446
Business is good, Ace.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.867
You should get back in the game.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.823
I need me a new ride,

38:56.919 --> 38:59.752
and I don't even like
them cars y'all driving nowadays.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.339
They all look like boxes to me.

39:01.423 --> 39:02.788
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

39:04.927 --> 39:08.340
I had me a '59 E! D.

39:09.348 --> 39:10.929
Red over white, you know.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.007
That Biarritz edition?

39:13.101 --> 39:16.514
225 inches long with them big-ass
motherfucking fins

39:16.605 --> 39:17.845
and them four taillights.

39:17.940 --> 39:20.226
That motherfucker was beautiful.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.438
Come on, man, Ace.
You could find you one in good shape.

39:23.529 --> 39:25.520
-Nah!
-Get out there again.

39:26.532 --> 39:29.774
A man has to know
when to step off the stage.

39:31.161 --> 39:33.903
I had my day in the sun.

39:33.997 --> 39:35.248
(DOOR OPENING)

39:36.124 --> 39:39.252
Ah! There's my woman.

39:39.336 --> 39:41.076
WOMAN: Hey, Melvin.

39:44.007 --> 39:45.383
-Ace.
-Hmm?

39:45.467 --> 39:46.502
Please.

39:58.689 --> 39:59.724
Hey, baby.

39:59.815 --> 40:01.771
I'll see you around, young man.

40:05.988 --> 40:09.230
-WOMAN: I got you butter pecan.
-Butter pecan.

40:09.324 --> 40:10.484
You got me.

40:11.618 --> 40:14.030
WOMAN: We still need to go by
the Rexall and get the medicine.

40:14.121 --> 40:15.702
ACE: All right, sugar.

40:21.420 --> 40:23.126
(SIGHS)

40:40.105 --> 40:42.096
-Tom my?
-Yeah?

40:43.817 --> 40:47.605
I'm not a made guy or nothing, right?

40:47.696 --> 40:50.358
(SCOFFS) Fuck, no.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.197
But I'm with you, right?

40:59.541 --> 41:01.042
So, what does that mean, exactly?

41:02.836 --> 41:04.542
What do you want?

41:10.761 --> 41:12.626
THUNDERTHIGHS: How you doing tonight?

41:12.721 --> 41:14.131
I know you like what you see, baby.

41:14.222 --> 41:15.678
How you doing?

41:15.766 --> 41:18.633
Hey, juicy wrap. I know you love it.

41:18.727 --> 41:20.888
Hey, sugar.
What you looking so glum for?

41:20.979 --> 41:22.389
You dating tonight?

41:22.481 --> 41:24.893
It's all right,
you don't gotta be shy, baby.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.689
Where you going?

41:26.777 --> 41:28.813
I know you see me, baby.

41:28.904 --> 41:30.644
I know you see me.

41:32.699 --> 41:34.109
Hey.

41:39.706 --> 41:41.446
Y'all don't gotta be shy.

41:55.931 --> 41:57.546
Shit.

42:02.938 --> 42:04.348
At your service.

42:05.357 --> 42:07.063
Where your shadow at?

42:07.859 --> 42:10.396
-In the diner using the head.
-Hmm.

42:10.946 --> 42:12.811
What you doing on the street?

42:12.906 --> 42:14.316
I thought you were, you know...

42:14.408 --> 42:17.741
I wasn't getting chosen
all that much on the inside.

42:17.828 --> 42:22.538
Out here, men with special tastes,
they find me.

42:22.624 --> 42:23.613
You mean to tell me...

42:23.709 --> 42:26.872
I'm a big girl
in case you didn't notice.

42:26.962 --> 42:30.170
All I notice are those beautiful eyes.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.748
Damn, Alston.

42:33.844 --> 42:35.380
Been a while since I gave it away,

42:35.470 --> 42:37.381
but I might have to make
an exception with you.

42:39.266 --> 42:41.006
I'm spoken for.

42:42.310 --> 42:44.346
At least, I think I am.

42:49.609 --> 42:51.349
Tell me something.

42:51.445 --> 42:54.027
How a dude like you get to be a cop?

42:57.868 --> 42:59.984
How you doing tonight?

43:02.414 --> 43:04.325
Like what you see, baby?

43:04.416 --> 43:06.953
Hey, sugar. How you doing?

43:10.172 --> 43:12.037
Can I make you date for a little bit?

43:13.884 --> 43:15.499
Won't take me long.

43:40.994 --> 43:42.780
WOMAN: Yeah, what are you looking at?

43:50.504 --> 43:52.961
VINCENT: Not Eddie Sorrentino,
Eddie Buccho.

43:53.048 --> 43:54.709
Which one is that?

43:54.800 --> 43:56.381
The one in Twist's crew.

43:56.468 --> 43:58.299
TOMMY: Twist over on Lefferts?

43:58.386 --> 44:00.763
-That bunch of fucking humps?
-VINCENT: Yeah, that bunch.

44:00.847 --> 44:02.007
TOMMY: Fuck, no.

44:02.682 --> 44:04.343
Candy store gangsters.

44:04.434 --> 44:05.674
Not one of them's made.

44:05.769 --> 44:07.760
-No?
-Nope.

44:37.676 --> 44:40.418

45:12.335 --> 45:14.291
Yeah. Come on.

45:38.361 --> 45:39.771
It's all there.

45:39.863 --> 45:41.478
Looks right.

45:43.950 --> 45:45.941
Give me the stuff.

45:46.036 --> 45:47.401
What stuff?

45:49.164 --> 45:50.620
The shit.

45:53.335 --> 45:54.575
Stop fucking around.

45:55.670 --> 45:57.285
Okay, sweetheart.

46:06.973 --> 46:08.304
Here you go.

46:22.364 --> 46:23.900
You're under arrest.

46:25.867 --> 46:26.947
Turn around.

46:31.331 --> 46:32.992
Just take me to the precinct.

46:33.917 --> 46:36.249
I know Alston, Haddix,
and all those guys.

46:36.336 --> 46:38.918
We're not NYPD, hon. We're federal.

46:39.005 --> 46:42.213
You just bought quantity.
You're looking at a long time.

46:42.300 --> 46:44.382
Unless you wanna speak on that bold,
cowboy-looking brother

46:44.469 --> 46:45.879
who sent you in here.

46:45.971 --> 46:47.256
Maybe then we can help you out.

46:53.937 --> 46:55.427

Uh-huh.

47:19.504 --> 47:21.961
Okay. All right.

47:22.757 --> 47:24.213
Okay, let me know.

47:25.010 --> 47:26.170
That was Harvey.

47:26.261 --> 47:28.172
His car broke down on the LIE

47:28.263 --> 47:32.051
and they're towing him
to a garage now.

47:32.142 --> 47:35.350
-And he just wants us to wait?
-Yeah.

47:40.608 --> 47:42.599
CANDY: This your first time?

47:44.779 --> 47:46.610
It's just fucking.

47:53.663 --> 47:54.903
Hey.

47:54.998 --> 47:56.534
Hey, you.

47:59.294 --> 48:01.159
The hell happened to you?

48:01.254 --> 48:02.960
I hit this guy.

48:03.048 --> 48:04.834
This asshole over in Brooklyn.

48:04.924 --> 48:06.915
-Brooklyn?
-Yeah.

48:07.010 --> 48:08.295
VVhy?

48:09.345 --> 48:11.006
Beat on my wife.

48:13.141 --> 48:14.597
My ex-wife.

48:14.684 --> 48:16.015
Whatever.

48:23.068 --> 48:24.649
-Hey, Vince.
-What?

48:24.736 --> 48:29.947
Um, I've been talking to Paul,
and he wants to open his own spot.

48:30.033 --> 48:31.022
So?

48:31.117 --> 48:32.527
So you should back him.

48:33.328 --> 48:35.068
Go in with him on a downtown place.

48:36.414 --> 48:38.746
He knows the Village.
Like, really knows it.

48:40.251 --> 48:43.209
And with money behind him
and somebody who could leverage

48:43.296 --> 48:45.332
paying off the cops like you all do...

48:46.174 --> 48:48.756

48:57.185 --> 48:59.346
Sweeney, you were
just in here last night.

48:59.437 --> 49:01.644
Now, I know you're not
back here that quick.

49:01.731 --> 49:02.971
Tell him.

49:03.066 --> 49:05.523
You guys didn't find a small book,

49:05.610 --> 49:09.102
puke green, about, like, this big?

49:10.115 --> 49:11.104
A book?

49:12.992 --> 49:14.493
I'll check with Mike when he comes in,

49:14.577 --> 49:15.987
but I don't think so.

49:19.040 --> 49:20.325
SANDRA: If you could just talk to him.

49:20.416 --> 49:23.544
Put that goddamn thing away.

49:23.628 --> 49:25.289
You shouldn't have come down here
looking for me,

49:25.380 --> 49:27.746
-not to the house.
-But I'm out of time.

49:27.841 --> 49:29.752
My article goes to press tonight.

49:29.843 --> 49:33.586
My editor, I showed him
the book and he says it's not enough.

49:33.680 --> 49:36.217
-But if you could confirm, it could...
-How is that not enough?

49:36.307 --> 49:37.808
It's just numbers in there.

49:37.892 --> 49:39.883
Just a bunch of addresses and amounts.

49:39.978 --> 49:43.186
He says I need someone to say
what it all means

49:43.273 --> 49:45.013
or we still can't name people.

49:45.108 --> 49:47.019
So, if I just say what it is,

49:47.110 --> 49:48.691
they'll run the story you want?

49:48.778 --> 49:51.690
Yes, if you say what it is.

49:51.781 --> 49:53.157
And you'll keep my...

49:54.826 --> 49:57.192
You'll keep my name
out of your goddamn paper?

49:59.664 --> 50:01.165
I gotta go.

50:21.269 --> 50:25.012
Um, so, Harvey can't make it today.

50:25.106 --> 50:28.314
He says that they can't fix his car
until they get another part,

50:28.401 --> 50:32.269
and it's gonna be hours,
so he says to just call it a day.

50:32.363 --> 50:33.648
We still get paid for our time?

50:33.740 --> 50:35.196
I don't know.

50:36.868 --> 50:39.109
Hey, fuck that. We're here.

50:39.204 --> 50:40.660
We're not gonna fucking go home.

50:55.053 --> 50:56.042
All right.

MAN 2: Yeah.

51:20.286 --> 51:22.823
Yeah, that's some wig you got there.

51:23.539 --> 51:25.700
Kind of screams it's not really you.

51:32.298 --> 51:34.038
You're worried
you're gonna make a movie

51:34.133 --> 51:35.543
and you're gonna get recognized?

51:36.052 --> 51:37.462
Yeah.

51:38.346 --> 51:39.836
So what?

51:46.646 --> 51:47.806
(CANDY CHUCKLES)

51:47.897 --> 51:50.980
I see you got
quite the wig your own self.

51:51.067 --> 51:52.773
Yeah.

51:55.571 --> 51:57.232
I don't need it.

52:19.262 --> 52:21.628
These are Harvey's notes
for the shoot.

Anything we need to talk about?

52:55.590 --> 52:56.579
Captain?

52:58.676 --> 53:00.177
A word to the wise, patrolman.

53:01.095 --> 53:02.505
I have your back.

53:02.597 --> 53:04.337
And when the shit
hits the fan around here,

53:04.432 --> 53:06.969
I'm gonna make sure you come through
with flying colors.

53:07.352 --> 53:08.762
But the one thing I need

53:08.853 --> 53:11.390
is to know that I have
the loyalty of my people.

53:11.481 --> 53:14.518
Whatever you know about what's
going on in this house comes to me

53:14.609 --> 53:16.065
and goes up the ladder from me.

53:16.152 --> 53:17.608
Understand?

53:19.489 --> 53:22.481
Trust me, I am going to scrub
this shithole clean,

53:22.575 --> 53:25.487
but I can only do that
if we keep our dirt in-house.

Yes, sir.
