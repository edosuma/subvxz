WEBVTT

00:04.872 --> 00:07.241
( theme music playing )

01:40.568 --> 01:44.205
( Italian opera music
playing )

02:21.008 --> 02:23.377
( panting )

02:27.481 --> 02:30.851
- ( gasping )
- Stumpy: MAKE SURE
THAT'S TIED DOWN!

02:30.951 --> 02:34.722
( man shouting )

02:44.164 --> 02:48.402
ALL RIGHT, FOLKS.
LET'S GET A MOVE ON.

03:05.786 --> 03:09.290
- Man: GOT ROOM
FOR ONE MORE?
- Man 2: YEAH.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.900
YOU RIDING WITH ME?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.053
DON'T!

03:40.153 --> 03:41.955
WHAT?

03:42.055 --> 03:43.891
LET'S JUST LET THEM GO,

03:43.991 --> 03:46.126
JUST LET THEM DRIVE OFF.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.096
YEAH,
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.665
NO, I MEAN IT.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.504
I... I CAN'T.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.772
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO DO

03:58.872 --> 04:01.609
AND IT'S OUT
THAT WAY.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.387
WE COULD'VE GONE ANYWHERE.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.392
( engine starts )

04:23.531 --> 04:27.034
Justin:
SHE IS WILLFUL.

04:28.336 --> 04:31.605
SO WILLFUL.

04:31.705 --> 04:35.142
SHE SHOWS ABSOLUTELY
NO REMORSE,

04:35.242 --> 04:37.911
ONLY ARROGANCE
AND HUBRIS.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.848
IT IS UNSEEMLY.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.618
IT'S UNGODLY.

04:49.423 --> 04:52.259
I AM A MAN OF GOD.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.863
BUT I AM ALSO
HER BROTHER, NORMAN.

04:55.963 --> 05:00.100
THIS WOMAN HAS DEVOTED
HER LIFE TO ME

05:00.200 --> 05:02.670
AND MY MINISTRY.

05:10.744 --> 05:15.883
LATE AT NIGHT,
I LIE AWAKE...

05:15.983 --> 05:19.753
AND I STRUGGLE
WITH THE PATH
I HAVE CHOSEN.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.758
I AM A MAN OF GOD.

05:27.094 --> 05:31.899
I AM A MAN OF GOD.

05:31.999 --> 05:36.236
ONLY THROUGH SACRIFICE
COMES REDEMPTION.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.439
( sighing )

05:39.807 --> 05:41.809
SHE MUST LEARN.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.016
( kisses )

05:54.221 --> 05:56.957
( whispers )
SHE MUST LEARN.

06:19.447 --> 06:22.950
Stumpy:
ALL RIGHT, I'M A "B."

06:23.717 --> 06:26.420
ARE YOU A FAMOUS ACTOR?

06:27.154 --> 06:29.122
NO.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.825
NO, I AM NOT
LIONEL BARRYMORE.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.227
I'M JUST SAYING,
THAT FIGHT WAS
A WEEK AGO.

06:34.327 --> 06:38.265
- SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE
GOTTEN THE PAYOFF BY NOW?
- ARE YOU A FAMOUS SINGER?

06:38.365 --> 06:40.701
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HOLD-UP IS.
UH...

06:40.801 --> 06:44.271
NO, I AM NOT
MILDRED BAILEY.

06:44.371 --> 06:47.508
WELL, CAN'T YOU JUST
CALL THAT BOOKIE?

06:47.608 --> 06:49.042
I CALLED BUD.

06:49.142 --> 06:52.880
HE'LL WIRE ME
THE MONEY BY MONDAY,
DON'T YOU WORRY.

06:55.182 --> 06:59.286
- ARE YOU A FAMOUS LIAR?
- I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO PLAY, MAMA.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.755
- IT JUST POPPED INTO MY HEAD.
- YOU MIGHT HAVE ME THERE.

07:01.855 --> 07:05.826
- I CAN'T THINK
OF ANY FAMOUS LIARS.
- NO? I CAN.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.663
( ragtime ballad playing )

07:16.470 --> 07:18.906
SO WHAT IS IT
YOU NEED TO DO?

07:20.173 --> 07:22.075
I'M LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.481
MY PA.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.719
HE'S OUT THIS WAY
SOMEWHERE.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.725
IF I MET MY FATHER,
I'D KILL HIM DEAD.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.832
HE RAPED MY MA.

07:47.601 --> 07:50.604
THAT'S WHY SHE HATES ME.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.641
SHE DIDN'T
HATE YOU, SOF.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.243
HOW COULD ANYBODY
HATE YOU?

08:32.613 --> 08:34.715
WHAT THE HELL?

08:37.484 --> 08:39.419
( gears grind )

08:39.519 --> 08:41.789
JONES, GOD DAMN IT!

08:44.424 --> 08:46.827
WHAT THE--?

08:52.332 --> 08:55.168
SHIT CHRISTMAS.

09:44.517 --> 09:45.953
Jones:
WHAT HAPPENED?

09:46.053 --> 09:49.122
THEM SONS OF BITCHES
TORCHED US OUT.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.457
WHO?

09:50.557 --> 09:52.492
Man:
FUCKING DAILY BROTHERS.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.762
RAT-FUCKS BURNED
THE PLACE DOWN

09:54.862 --> 09:57.364
FOR THE INSURANCE,

09:57.464 --> 09:59.700
SURE AS HELL.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.736
( elephant groans )

10:02.836 --> 10:05.372
IS THAT SAMSON?

10:05.472 --> 10:07.074
CHARLIE LEWIS!

10:07.174 --> 10:09.009
- YES, SIR.
- HEY!

10:09.109 --> 10:11.278
- ( Samson chuckles )
- LONG TIME.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.512
LONG TIME.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.115
WHERE'S EVERYONE ELSE?

10:16.316 --> 10:18.585
MOST OF THEM
SCATTERED OUT.

10:18.686 --> 10:23.156
REST OF US AIN'T GOT
BUT A FEW BUSTED TRUCKS

10:23.256 --> 10:27.928
AND MAYBE $13 IN CHANGE
BETWEEN US.

10:28.028 --> 10:32.265
DAMN IF IT AIN'T
A LUCKY THING YOU COME BY.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.768
( elephant groans )

10:46.613 --> 10:48.348
I'M GONNA SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

10:48.448 --> 10:51.719
- YOU COMING?
- NO, I'LL WAIT.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.710
Jones: LET'S GO.
I WANT TO SET UP A CIRCLE
RIGHT AROUND OVER THERE.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.079
GET SOME SIDEWALLS
OFF THE HICKMAN.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.381
SET UP A TENT
OVER THERE, ALL RIGHT?

11:21.481 --> 11:23.683
WATCH THE POTHOLES!

11:23.784 --> 11:25.218
LET'S GO, COME ON.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.987
COME ON NOW!

11:27.087 --> 11:30.157
SET UP THE COOK TENT
AND MAYBE ONE OF THE OTHER TOPS,
ALL RIGHT?

11:30.257 --> 11:34.962
TELL POSSUM TO GET
SOME CHOW GOING TOO.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.097
LET'S GO.
WATCH THE POTHOLES.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.700
WE'LL GET YOU SOME SUPPLIES.
THAT'S IT, JUST CIRCLE AROUND.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.503
GOOD.
TAKE A LOAD OFF.

11:43.603 --> 11:47.007
Woman:
HEY, STITCH.

11:47.107 --> 11:51.278
- SABINA.
- YOU AIN'T JUST GONNA
LEAVE US HERE NOW, ARE YOU?

11:52.379 --> 11:55.048
WELL, WHAT DOES IT
LOOK LIKE?

12:00.921 --> 12:03.824
I THOUGHT THE PLAN WAS
TO BE IN DAMASCUS BY DARK.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.593
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?
JUST KEEP GOING?

12:06.693 --> 12:09.029
WE'VE GOT A CODE!

12:12.299 --> 12:14.501
( lighter clinking )

12:21.408 --> 12:23.811
( woman sobbing )

12:51.304 --> 12:53.306
YOU OKAY?

13:06.719 --> 13:08.755
SWEETIE?

13:08.856 --> 13:11.224
- ARE YOU LOST?
- ( sobbing continues )

13:17.397 --> 13:20.500
Apollonia's voice:
EVERY PROPHET IN HER HOUSE!

13:20.600 --> 13:22.870
MOTHER.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.278
- HEY.
- ( panting )

13:33.513 --> 13:36.183
ARE YOU ALL THERE?

13:40.420 --> 13:41.621
WE'RE PITCHING CAMP HERE.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.456
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:43.556 --> 13:46.226
A FIRE.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.360
DID ANYBODY DIE?

13:47.460 --> 13:50.797
NO. NOT A ONE.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.066
THEY WAS ALL
REAL LUCKY.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.942
YOU MIGHT BE
MORE COMFORTABLE
IN YOUR TRAILER.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.411
I'D RATHER STAY HERE.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.882
I SHOULD GO HELP OUT
OR JONES WILL SKIN ME.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.852
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

14:12.953 --> 14:15.422
YOU'RE SHAKY.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.560
I'LL BE FINE.

14:33.073 --> 14:37.911
Iris:
MAKE HASTE, DEAR LORD,
TO DELIVER ME.

14:39.812 --> 14:44.184
MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME,
MY DEAREST GOD.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.889
LET THEM BE ASHAMED

14:49.990 --> 14:52.259
AND CONFOUNDED,

14:52.359 --> 14:56.229
THOSE WHO SEEK
TO TAKE MY SOUL.

14:56.329 --> 14:59.032
LET THEM BE TURNED BACKWARD
INTO CONFUSION,

14:59.132 --> 15:02.469
THOSE THAT DESIRE MY HURT.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.273
( sobbing )

15:06.373 --> 15:09.442
LET THOSE THAT WILL SAY--
( wails )

15:12.445 --> 15:14.214
( shouts )

15:14.314 --> 15:19.686
TURN THEM BACK AS REWARD
FOR THE SHAME.

15:22.122 --> 15:25.358
- OH, MAKE HASTE.
- ( glass crackles )

15:28.595 --> 15:31.031
MAKE HASTE, DEAR GOD.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.238
MAKE HASTE
TO DELIVER ME.

15:43.810 --> 15:46.113
( trumpets )

15:54.121 --> 15:55.555
Cook:
HERE YOU GO,
BOSS.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.190
WELL.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.792
YOU FOLKS LOOK TO BE
MIGHTY FLUSH.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.195
OH, WE DO ALL RIGHT.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.964
WHAT CIRCUIT HAVE
Y'ALL BEEN ON?

16:07.434 --> 16:09.736
( stammering )
I'M JUST ASKING,

16:09.836 --> 16:12.805
'CAUSE YOU KNOW
THE DAILY BROTHERS
HAD A HARD SUMMER.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.274
REAL HARD.

16:14.374 --> 16:17.144
HEY, I HEARD Y'ALL
LOST A FEW ACTS.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.112
NOW THAT'S
GOT TO BE TOUGH.

16:19.212 --> 16:22.149
YOU LOOKING
TO HOOK UP WITH US?

16:24.751 --> 16:28.688
WELL, WE MIGHT BE
PERSUADED.

16:28.788 --> 16:31.591
FORGET IT.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.431
- Man: HOWDY.
- HOWDY.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.267
BERT HAGENBECK,
NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:40.367 --> 16:43.536
Bert:
IT'S MIGHTY CHRISTIAN
OF YOU TO LEND A HAND.

16:43.636 --> 16:48.708
THAT IS
THE WORST DAMNED HE/SHE
I EVER DID SEE.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.543
WHEN DID YOU EVER SEE
A GOOD ONE?

16:50.643 --> 16:52.645
( laughing )
NEVER.

16:57.950 --> 17:01.221
- I BROUGHT YOU SOME GRUB.
- THANKS.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.644
YOU DON'T HAVE
TOEEP ME COMPANY.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.046
I KNOW THAT.

17:27.147 --> 17:31.284
I CAN DO WITHOUT
ALL THE JIBBER-JABBER.

17:31.384 --> 17:35.655
IT'S BAD ENOUGH WE HAD
TO DRIVE STAKES HERE
FOR THE DAY.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.324
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

17:37.424 --> 17:40.760
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
REALLY KNOW WHERE
YOUR FATHER IS.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.830
I'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

17:43.930 --> 17:47.734
- WHERE?
- DAMASCUS.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.069
I'VE BEEN
TO DAMASCUS.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.272
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S IN DAMASCUS?

17:52.372 --> 17:55.608
A WHOLE LOT OF PIGSHIT
AND NO ONE TO SHOVEL IT.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.746
MAYBE.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.920
AND WHAT IF
HE IS THERE?

18:08.020 --> 18:09.722
WHAT DIFFERENCE
IS IT GONNA MAKE?

18:09.822 --> 18:14.294
PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME,
WE DON'T HAVE NICE
LITTLE FAMILIES.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.430
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND
ANYTHING GOOD THERE.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.900
I KNOW THAT.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.536
BUT I STILL
GOT TO FIND HIM.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.340
I'M LEAVING.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.477
THERE'S NOTHING
LEFT FOR ME HERE.

18:34.046 --> 18:36.416
YOU COULD
COME WITH ME.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.554
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU SAY.

18:41.654 --> 18:45.192
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE--
NO MORE THAN I DO.

18:45.292 --> 18:48.127
BELONGING HAS GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

18:49.896 --> 18:53.032
IT'S JUST... MY LOT,

18:53.132 --> 18:54.334
THAT'S ALL.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.103
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.

18:57.204 --> 19:00.773
YEAH, IT DOES.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.448
Tommy:
EVERYTHING'S IN PLACE.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.551
FOLKS ARE ALREADY STAKING OUT
SEATS FOR YOUR SERMON TONIGHT.

19:11.651 --> 19:15.087
I'VE ARRANGED
FOR A PUBLIC-ADDRESS SYSTEM

19:15.188 --> 19:16.956
WITH A LOUDSPEAKER OUTSIDE

19:17.056 --> 19:19.659
FOR THE OVERFLOW.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.631
AND THE AUTHORITIES?

19:24.731 --> 19:27.934
I'VE CONTACTED
THE COUNTY PROSECUTOR.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.603
HE'LL BE THERE PERSONALLY.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.479
I'M SORRY.

19:41.214 --> 19:43.216
SORRY?

19:44.651 --> 19:48.221
I KNOW THIS MUST BE
VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOU.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.391
YES.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.627
YES, IT IS.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.398
BUT MY MINISTRY
MUST COME FIRST.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.871
THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU
A GREAT MAN.

20:09.108 --> 20:11.811
SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.715
WE'LL GET A GOOD LAWYER.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.518
SHE'LL NEVER SEE
THE INSIDE OF A COURTROOM.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.953
NO?

20:21.053 --> 20:22.755
SHE'S A WOMAN.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.629
THEY DON'T HANG WOMEN
IN CALIFORNIA.

20:42.141 --> 20:44.477
( ragtime music playing )

20:49.782 --> 20:51.751
( laughing )

20:54.321 --> 20:56.689
- THERE YOU GO.
- ALL RIGHT.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.333
OLGA MORENO?

21:06.433 --> 21:07.834
I KNOW HER.

21:07.934 --> 21:11.571
MET HER
IN ANDERSON, INDIANA,
AWHILE BACK.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.710
OLGA MORENO'S A COW.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.679
( coughs, laughing )

21:19.779 --> 21:23.783
AND THAT BEARD OF HERS
IS GAFFED.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.251
NO!

21:25.352 --> 21:26.819
HORSEHAIR.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.488
( groans )

21:28.588 --> 21:32.024
Rita Sue:
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING,
I AM SICK OF THE ROAD.

21:32.124 --> 21:36.028
ME AND FELIX, WE BEEN
LOOKING INTO ONE OF THEM
ALLIGATOR FARMS DOWN IN FLORIDA.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.430
I HEARD OF THEM.

21:37.530 --> 21:40.933
SHOW THEM OFF TO TOURISTS,
RAISE THEM FOR SKINS.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.403
AND THE MEAT.

21:45.171 --> 21:47.574
- AND THE MILK.
- MILK?

21:47.674 --> 21:50.810
GATOR MILK HAS TWICE
THE VITAMINS AND MINERALS
AS COW MILK.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.945
IT'S WHAT YOU CALL
AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY.

21:53.045 --> 21:56.015
- MM. MM-HM.
- ( swing music playing )

21:56.115 --> 21:57.283
COME ON, SUGAR PUSS.

21:57.384 --> 21:59.719
- THAT'S OUR SONG.
- BERT, HONEY.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.021
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

22:17.604 --> 22:20.006
( music continues )

22:25.044 --> 22:27.046
* That's Charlie,
Charlie Two-Step *

22:27.146 --> 22:29.549
* That's Charlie,
the hottest man in town *

22:29.649 --> 22:31.851
* That's Charlie, and when
he starts to two-step *

22:31.951 --> 22:35.054
* That's Charlie--
yowzer! *

22:37.890 --> 22:40.359
DANCE?

22:42.395 --> 22:44.063
OH!

22:44.163 --> 22:47.299
OH, I FORGOT.

22:47.400 --> 22:51.203
HOW MUCH IS IT
FOR A DANCE, HUH?

22:51.303 --> 22:53.673
TWO BITS?

22:55.408 --> 22:56.843
FOUR?

22:56.943 --> 22:59.979
HMM? I MEAN
WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.749
LEAVE ME ALONE, BURLEY.

23:02.849 --> 23:05.017
COME AND DANCE
WITH ME, LITTLE GIRL.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.219
GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME!

23:07.319 --> 23:10.523
- THAT'S ENOUGH.
- FUCK YOU.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.127
( laughs )

23:17.464 --> 23:19.432
- GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
- ALL RIGHT.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.400
Roustie:
COME ON, BURLEY.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.870
( groans )

23:25.071 --> 23:27.273
( chuckling )

23:27.373 --> 23:30.176
YOU OKAY?

23:34.413 --> 23:36.983
I AIN'T MUCH
FOR DANCING.

23:40.887 --> 23:43.923
* That's Charlie,
Charlie Two-Step *

23:44.023 --> 23:46.025
* He's the hottest man
in town *

23:46.125 --> 23:48.728
* That's Charlie,
when he starts to two-step *

23:48.828 --> 23:51.197
* How he shakes
his dog around *

23:51.297 --> 23:53.700
* He's got it,
my, oh me *

23:53.800 --> 23:55.568
* He's quite
the sight to see *

23:55.668 --> 23:57.970
* Now that's stomping,
stomping with a kick *

23:58.070 --> 24:01.508
* When he stomps
that light fantastic... *

24:01.608 --> 24:04.043
( tempo increases )

24:04.143 --> 24:07.046
( scatting )

24:07.146 --> 24:11.217
* Mama does it,
Papa does the ring-ding-dango,
that's Charlie Two-Step *

24:11.317 --> 24:14.687
* That's Charlie Two-Step...

24:17.156 --> 24:21.060
SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE HAVING
A PARTY OVER THERE
OR SOMETHING.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.962
WANT TO GO SEE?

24:26.132 --> 24:28.701
I FEEL SAFER HERE.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.503
YOU GO.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.338
I'M OKAY.

24:32.438 --> 24:35.975
( sentimental ballad
playing )

24:38.511 --> 24:43.783
* That's my lullaby
just for you *

24:43.883 --> 24:49.421
* Go to sleep,
my angel child... *

24:49.522 --> 24:50.990
BABY?

24:51.090 --> 24:52.959
HUH?

24:53.960 --> 24:56.629
YOU KNOW THAT $400
I GAVE YOU?

24:57.363 --> 24:58.765
YEAH, HUH.

24:58.865 --> 25:01.834
I WAS THINKING
WITH THAT BIG WIN
YOU HAD AT THE FIGHT,

25:01.934 --> 25:07.907
MAYBE WE COULD MAKE
A DOWN PAYMENT ON THAT PLACE
IN THE KEYS.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.276
WELL SURE,
PUT A DOWN PAYMENT,
GET A NEW CAR,

25:10.376 --> 25:12.712
GET YOU SOME
NEW CLOTHES, OR...

25:14.947 --> 25:16.749
OR A TRIP
TO NIAGARA FALLS.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.318
THAT'S A MIGHTY BIG
PAYOFF.

25:19.418 --> 25:22.088
HOW MUCH DID YOU
SAY IT WAS?

25:22.188 --> 25:23.956
$1400.

25:24.056 --> 25:27.059
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
IT WAS $1200.

25:29.061 --> 25:31.798
$1400.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.700
* Snowball, my honey

25:33.800 --> 25:36.936
* Smile at me
each day *

25:37.036 --> 25:42.642
* 'Cause Daddy likes
those dark brown eyes *

25:42.742 --> 25:45.712
* You're my
only sweetheart *

25:45.812 --> 25:48.280
* Little chocolate bar

25:48.380 --> 25:53.953
* I'll eat you up
someday *

25:54.053 --> 25:56.756
* Your two hands
and feet are... *

25:56.856 --> 26:00.693
- COME ON.
- WHAT?

26:00.793 --> 26:03.029
YOU CAN'T STAY
IN THIS TRUCK
ALL NIGHT.

26:03.129 --> 26:08.400
* "Why stay?"
the good Lord said *

26:08.500 --> 26:11.503
* He used
an apple dumpling *

26:11.604 --> 26:14.173
* To make your head

26:14.273 --> 26:17.810
* You know
that's really something *

26:17.910 --> 26:22.314
* Snowball, my honey,
don't you melt away *

26:22.414 --> 26:27.019
* 'Cause Daddy likes
those dark brown eyes... *

26:27.119 --> 26:28.587
I CAN'T.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.089
SURE YOU CAN.

26:30.189 --> 26:34.026
I'VE SEEN YOU DANCE.
YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD.

26:35.494 --> 26:37.429
ME, I AIN'T
NO FRED ASTAIRE,

26:37.529 --> 26:39.932
BUT I LIKE THIS SONG.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.502
ME TOO.

26:43.602 --> 26:49.208
* I'll eat you up
someday *

26:49.308 --> 26:55.481
* Your two hands and feet
are just as black as tar *

26:55.581 --> 26:58.217
* But don't you cry

26:58.317 --> 27:03.956
* "Why stay?"
the good Lord said *

27:04.056 --> 27:07.193
* He used
an apple dumpling *

27:07.293 --> 27:09.729
* To make your head

27:09.829 --> 27:12.498
* You know
that's really something *

27:12.598 --> 27:16.168
* Snowball, my honey

27:16.268 --> 27:17.904
* Don't you melt away

27:18.004 --> 27:22.909
* 'Cause Daddy likes
those dark brown eyes *

27:24.677 --> 27:30.416
* Daddy likes
those dark brown eyes. *

27:32.852 --> 27:36.355
( crowd singing hymns )

27:56.208 --> 27:58.811
I'M SORRY, ALEXSEI.

27:58.911 --> 28:01.313
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
WHAT YOU WANT.

28:01.413 --> 28:04.884
WHAT IS IT
YOU THINK I WANT?

28:06.252 --> 28:08.620
REMORSE.

28:08.721 --> 28:11.523
REGRET.

28:11.623 --> 28:14.961
AND I WOULD
DO IT AGAIN FOR YOU.

28:25.471 --> 28:29.141
OH, ISN'T IT
BEAUTIFUL?

28:34.213 --> 28:37.183
- Woman: ...FRESH AIR.
- Man: YEAH, I WILL.

28:53.532 --> 28:56.135

29:01.607 --> 29:03.242
( heavy breathing )

29:03.342 --> 29:05.444
( snorting )

29:07.646 --> 29:09.148
OH...

29:09.248 --> 29:11.550
GOOD GOD.

29:11.650 --> 29:14.153
WHO'D--?

29:14.787 --> 29:17.023
HI, ELEPHANT.

29:17.123 --> 29:19.125
- ( exhales )
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?

29:19.225 --> 29:22.995
Rita Sue:
OH, THIS DRESS WILL BE
JUST DARLING ON YOU.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.031
YOU MAY HAVE TO
TAKE IN THE BOSOM,

29:25.131 --> 29:27.399
BUT THIS BLUE
WILL BE JUST SWELL
WITH YOUR EYES.

29:27.499 --> 29:30.002
- Sabina: AIN'T THIS A DEAR?
- IT'S YOURS.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.839
AND I THOUGHT
THAT YOU AND FELIX MIGHT BE
ABOUT THE SAME SIZE.

29:32.939 --> 29:35.441
- I DO LIKE THIS HAT.
- WELL, OF COURSE YOU DO.

29:35.541 --> 29:36.876
LOOK AT THAT.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.345

THAT'S MY FAVORITE THATCH!
I USE THAT IN THE SHOW.

29:43.549 --> 29:44.716
THANK YOU MUCH.

29:44.817 --> 29:46.485
WHAT THE HELL

29:46.585 --> 29:49.421
NOW, FELIX,
THESE PEOPLE JUST ABOUT
LOST EVERYTHING THEY GOT.

29:49.521 --> 29:52.691
IT'S ONLY RIGHT
THAT WE GIVE AWAY A FEW
OF OUR OLD THINGS.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.961
OH, NOW THAT-- GOD DAMN IT!
THAT IS A NEW TIE.

29:55.061 --> 29:57.163
I AIN'T WORN THIS BUT TWICE!

29:58.630 --> 30:00.632
FELIX, THESE PEOPLE
ARE IN NEED.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.268
WHERE'S THE CHARITARIAN
IN YOU?

30:02.368 --> 30:04.803
BESIDES, WE GOT
THAT BIG WINDFALL COMING.

30:04.904 --> 30:07.673
BUY OURSELVES A WHOLE
NEW WARDROBE.

30:07.773 --> 30:09.808
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT.

30:09.909 --> 30:12.444
- THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT.
GOD DAMN IT.

COME ON.

30:14.046 --> 30:16.548
Y'ALL JUST GET GOING.
MY WIFE'S NOT FEELING WELL.

30:16.648 --> 30:17.984
FELIX,
I'M FEELING JUST FINE.

30:18.084 --> 30:19.986
YOU GO ON AND KEEP
EVERYTHING YOU GOT.

30:20.086 --> 30:22.354
GOD DAMN IT,
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR GOURD?!

30:22.454 --> 30:24.490
( shouts )
GOD DAMN!

30:26.192 --> 30:28.995
WHO CARES ABOUT
THESE CLOTHES, FELIX?

30:29.095 --> 30:30.963
WE'RE GONNA BE RICH,
AIN'T WE?

30:31.063 --> 30:33.765
WE'RE GONNA BUY OURSELVES
AN ALLIGATOR FARM,

30:33.866 --> 30:35.968

A BRAND NEW CAR,

30:36.068 --> 30:39.171

AIN'T THAT WHAT YOU SAID?

30:48.547 --> 30:49.815
YEAH.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.550

31:53.579 --> 31:55.514
YEAH.

32:02.488 --> 32:05.257
NOW, RITA SUE...

32:09.061 --> 32:11.630

ONE OF THOSE.

32:45.697 --> 32:48.300
OH, HONEY...

32:56.942 --> 32:59.678
( bawdy jazz music
playing )

33:11.323 --> 33:13.692
YOU ALWAYS HAD
A BEARD?

33:13.792 --> 33:15.994
EVER SINCE I WAS 13.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.996
( chuckling )

33:18.097 --> 33:20.832

- I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
- SHE'S THERE!
SHE'S RIGHT THERE!

34:45.851 --> 34:48.820
- HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE HER?
- HEY, IT'S THE FIRE.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.522
IT'S MAKING YOU CRAZY.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.863
SHE'S GONE.

35:05.737 --> 35:08.207
WHAT DID YOU DO?

35:09.875 --> 35:11.843
I DON'T KNOW.

STUMPY, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THIS, ALL RIGHT?
CALM DOWN!

36:07.933 --> 36:10.902
I WON'T LET THIS
GODDAMN SCREW-WORM
INFEST MY FAMILY AGAIN.

36:11.002 --> 36:14.039
IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR A FIGHT, I AIN'T

PUT 'EM UP, JONES.
PUT 'EM UP!

36:37.829 --> 36:40.532
( distant
swing music playing )

36:44.002 --> 36:47.706
THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU,
I KNEW YOU WERE DIFFERENT.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.745
I REMEMBER.

36:56.014 --> 36:58.950
YOU WERE SITTING
ON THE BUS,

36:59.050 --> 37:01.720
WATCHING.

37:02.654 --> 37:04.656
I WAS.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.265
HEY.

37:13.365 --> 37:16.535

RAIN?

39:04.042 --> 39:07.446

39:48.219 --> 39:51.523
STAY DOWN, STUMPY,
GOD DAMN IT!

39:55.126 --> 39:58.697

ARE YOU DOING?

40:54.753 --> 40:57.956
I'M JUST DEFENDING...

40:58.056 --> 41:01.192
MY FAMILY'S HONOR!

41:02.961 --> 41:04.996
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

HAWKINS!

41:36.394 --> 41:40.732

I HAVE AN IMPORTANT
ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE,

42:52.503 --> 42:57.876
ONE THAT WILL PROFOUNDLY AFFECT
THE FUTURE OF THIS MINISTRY.

43:03.949 --> 43:08.419
AS YOU KNOW,
OUR CONGREGATION WAS BORN

43:08.519 --> 43:10.922
FROM THE ASHES
OF AN UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY,

43:11.022 --> 43:14.726
A TRAGEDY THAT STILL
CRIES OUT FOR JUSTICE.

43:14.826 --> 43:17.495
- Man: OH LORD!
- Woman: SPEAK, FATHER!

43:17.595 --> 43:19.831
ONE YEAR AGO,

43:19.931 --> 43:24.335
SIX INNOCENT CHILDREN
AND THEIR MATRON WERE
MURDERED,

43:24.435 --> 43:30.642
CRUELLY CONSUMED
IN THE HELLISH FLAMES
OF AN ARSON FIRE...

43:30.742 --> 43:34.980
A CRIME FOR WHICH NO MAN
HAS YET TO FACE JUDGMENT.

43:36.848 --> 43:38.717
SINCE THAT TERRIBLE DAY,

43:38.817 --> 43:42.187
I HAVE MADE IT
MY PERSONAL MANDATE

43:42.287 --> 43:47.793
TO SEE TO IT THAT
THE MONSTER THAT COMMITTED
THIS ABOMINABLE ACT

43:47.893 --> 43:51.963
BE CAPTURED, TRIED,
AND PROSECUTED

43:52.063 --> 43:55.166
- TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
OF THE LAWS OF MAN.
- ( crowd shouting )

43:55.266 --> 43:57.936
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
I STAND BEFORE YOU

43:58.036 --> 44:01.439
TO REPORT
THAT THE INVESTIGATION
UNDERTAKEN BY THIS MINISTRY

44:01.539 --> 44:04.142
HAS AT LONG LAST
BORNE FRUIT.

44:04.242 --> 44:07.612
- AMEN.
- A PERPETRATOR
HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED

44:07.713 --> 44:09.815
AND A CONFESSION
HAS BEEN SIGNED!

44:09.915 --> 44:11.249
- HALLELUJAH!
- YES!

44:11.349 --> 44:13.651
BUT WAIT!
WAIT, BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

44:13.752 --> 44:16.688
THIS IS NOT CAUSE
FOR JUBILATION.

44:16.788 --> 44:21.626
NO.
BUT FOR LAMENTATION.

44:21.727 --> 44:24.529
YES, LAMENT,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

44:24.629 --> 44:29.434
LAMENT, FOR THE KILLER
IS NOT A STRANGER BUT ONE
OF OUR OWN.

44:29.534 --> 44:33.839
A TRUSTED LEADER
IN OUR MINISTRY...

44:33.939 --> 44:38.043
MASQUERADING AS A MEMBER
OF OUR FAMILY IN CHRIST!

44:38.143 --> 44:39.544
( murmuring )

44:39.644 --> 44:41.446
MR. DOLAN?

44:41.546 --> 44:43.882
( clears throat )

44:45.250 --> 44:47.518
GOOD EVENING,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

44:47.618 --> 44:49.755
MY NAME IS TOMMY DOLAN.

44:49.855 --> 44:53.191
MANY OF YOU KNOW ME
FROM THE RADIO,

44:53.291 --> 44:57.295
AND THE WORK
I'VE DONE ON BEHALF
OF THIS GREAT MINISTRY.

44:57.395 --> 44:59.597
AS BROTHER JUSTIN SAID,

44:59.697 --> 45:04.202
THIS CONGREGATION
WAS BORN OF TRAGEDY.

45:05.804 --> 45:08.907
I PRAY ONLY THAT IT
ISN'T TORN ASUNDER

45:09.007 --> 45:11.176
BY WHAT YOU HEAR TONIGHT.

45:13.745 --> 45:17.215
I'D LIKE TO NOW READ
FROM A SIGNED STATEMENT.

45:17.916 --> 45:20.118
( clears throat )

45:26.124 --> 45:29.660
"ON THE EVENING
OF SEPTEMBER 8th, 1934,

45:29.761 --> 45:31.997
I ENTERED
THE DIGNITY MINISTRY

45:32.097 --> 45:34.132
POURED GASOLINE ON THE FLOOR
OF THE BASEMENT

45:34.232 --> 45:36.134
AND SET FIRE
TO THE ORPHANAGE.

45:36.234 --> 45:38.736
MY MOTIVE WAS TO GET
AN EXCLUSIVE STORY,

45:38.837 --> 45:43.308
SO THAT I MIGHT ADVANCE...
MY CAREER"?

45:43.408 --> 45:45.811
( audience jeering )

45:47.178 --> 45:48.579
HE'S THE ONE!

45:48.679 --> 45:50.715
HE KILLED THEM KIDS!

45:50.816 --> 45:53.518
NO! NO!

45:53.618 --> 45:56.487
NO, IT WAS IRIS.
SHE CONFESSED!

45:56.587 --> 45:57.856
SHE SIGNED IT!

45:57.956 --> 46:01.026
"I FELL UNDER A SHADOW.
IT PREYED UPON ME.

46:01.126 --> 46:04.095
IT NEEDED TO BE DONE.
SIGNED--"

46:07.365 --> 46:09.400
OH MY GOD.

46:10.535 --> 46:12.137
TOMMY DOLAN,

46:12.237 --> 46:15.206
BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME
BY THE COUNTY OF SAN BENITO,

46:15.306 --> 46:17.809
I HEREBY PLACE YOU
UNDER ARREST.

46:17.909 --> 46:19.044
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

46:19.144 --> 46:21.712
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!
IT WAS HER!

46:21.813 --> 46:23.681
SHE KILLED THOSE KIDS!

46:23.781 --> 46:25.450
( growls )

46:25.550 --> 46:26.684
YOU SET ME UP.

46:26.784 --> 46:29.487
OH, TOMMY.

46:29.587 --> 46:31.890
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

46:46.404 --> 46:48.439
( shouts )
HEY!

46:49.941 --> 46:52.310
( jazz music playing )

46:56.647 --> 46:59.350
Announcer:
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
lend a kind ear

46:59.450 --> 47:06.591
as we bring you
Brother Justin's Saturday
evening Church of the Air!

47:06.691 --> 47:10.261
Justin:
Whom are you struggling with?
Certainly not God.

47:10.361 --> 47:12.363
God's mind was
made up long before

47:12.463 --> 47:14.933
- the foundation
of earth was laid.
- ( rain stops )

47:15.033 --> 47:20.738
Let the wicked man
forsake his ways.

47:20.838 --> 47:23.241
When?
In a month?

47:23.341 --> 47:24.509
A day?

47:24.609 --> 47:26.544
No, now.

47:26.644 --> 47:31.416
The instant you yield,
God's plan of salvation
is thrown into gear.

47:31.516 --> 47:35.020
You will be saved
before you even know it,

47:35.120 --> 47:37.622
like a child being born.

47:44.229 --> 47:45.964
CHARLIE?

47:49.034 --> 47:52.537
COME ON IN, SUGAR.
DON'T BE SHY.

47:52.637 --> 47:56.507
DON'T WORRY,
I WON'T BITE.
( chuckles )

48:00.145 --> 48:02.613
UNLESSIN'
YOU WANT ME TO.

48:22.667 --> 48:25.270
WHERE'S THE BOY?

48:29.407 --> 48:31.376
( crying )

48:46.591 --> 48:48.093
SAMSON.

48:48.193 --> 48:51.096
I'LL GIVE YOU
5% OF THE RECEIPTS
ON THE TENNER,

48:51.196 --> 48:53.965
- YOUR MEALS AND GAS
FOR THE TRUCK.
- 20%.

48:54.065 --> 48:56.334
YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND, WOMAN.

48:56.434 --> 48:59.270
YOU KNOW WHAT KIND
OF A DRAW I AM.

49:02.807 --> 49:06.111
10%, NOW THAT'S MY
FINAL TOP OFFER.

49:06.211 --> 49:08.446
15% AND NOT A JOT LESS.

49:08.546 --> 49:11.649
RAY AND DIL DAILY
GIVE ME THAT,
PLUS 50 SUDS A WEEK.

49:11.749 --> 49:14.785
YEAH, WELL, RAY AND DIL DAILY
BURNED DOWN THEIR TEN-IN-ONE

49:14.885 --> 49:16.421
AND LEFT YOU HIGH AND DRY.

49:16.521 --> 49:19.624
I'M THINKING
I LOOK MIGHTY GOOD
NEXT TO THAT.

49:21.959 --> 49:23.594
WHAT ABOUT BERT?

49:27.865 --> 49:29.734
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

49:29.834 --> 49:32.370
I AIN'T COMING
WITHOUT HIM.

49:35.173 --> 49:36.874
HE'S MY HUSBAND.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.843
( scoffs )

49:38.943 --> 49:41.612
YOU MARRIED THAT BIRD?

49:46.184 --> 49:48.953
ANYTHING HE GETS
IS COMING OUT OF YOUR CUT.

49:49.054 --> 49:50.555
FINE.

49:55.626 --> 49:59.164
BY THE WAY,
WHO TOLD YOU RAY
AND DIL BURNED US DOWN?

49:59.264 --> 50:01.166
WELL, THEY DID,
DIDN'T THEY?

50:01.266 --> 50:04.302
DON'T KNOW.
THERE WAS A BALD-HEADED
FELLA NOSING AROUND.

50:04.402 --> 50:08.139
HAD A BADGE,
BUT HE WEREN'T NO COP.

50:08.239 --> 50:11.442
- Ben: HE'S AHEAD OF US?
- APPARENTLY SO.

50:11.542 --> 50:14.779
BOUND TO BE MILES
AHEAD BY NOW.

50:14.879 --> 50:17.915
LOOKING FOR A FELLA
NAMED SCUDDER.

50:18.015 --> 50:20.385
SHE THINKS THAT
THIS BALD-HEADED FELLA

50:20.485 --> 50:23.821
- TORCHED THE DAILY
BROTHERS OUTFIT?
- SHE DOES.

50:23.921 --> 50:25.590
HOW DID HE GET
AHEAD OF US?

50:25.690 --> 50:28.826
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT YOU'D BEST GET
AHEAD OF HIM.

50:28.926 --> 50:30.728
IF HE GETS
TO SCUDDER FIRST,

50:30.828 --> 50:35.266
SOMETHING TELLS ME
THERE AIN'T GONNA BE
MUCH OF HIM LEFT.

50:37.168 --> 50:40.871
I'M HEADING OUT THEN.
FASTER ON MY OWN.

50:40.971 --> 50:43.174
WE'LL MEET UP
IN DASCUS.

50:43.274 --> 50:45.410
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

50:45.510 --> 50:48.146
UNLESS YOU GOT
ANY BETTER IDEAS.

50:51.149 --> 50:53.551
I'LL TELL HIM.

50:56.787 --> 50:58.356
THIS SCORPION GAL--

50:58.456 --> 51:00.458
WHY SHOULD WE
BELIEVE HER?

51:00.558 --> 51:01.959
SHE AIN'T LYING.

51:02.059 --> 51:03.961
I MEAN, SHE'S LIED
ABOUT PLENTY,

51:04.061 --> 51:05.863
BUT SHE AIN'T LYING
ABOUT THIS.

51:05.963 --> 51:07.365
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

51:07.465 --> 51:11.236
( chuckles )
WE WAS MARRIED
FOR NINE YEARS.

52:28.546 --> 52:31.081
Stroud:
THAT'S RIGHT.

52:31.182 --> 52:33.318
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

52:33.418 --> 52:35.486
DIDN'T I TELL YOU BOYS
THE BEST WAY

52:35.586 --> 52:38.556
TO FOLLOW SOMEBODY
IS TO GET AHEAD OF THEM?

52:38.656 --> 52:41.559
( chuckles )

52:41.659 --> 52:44.028
WELL, THAT'S ENOUGH
AIRING OUT FOR YOU TWO.

52:44.128 --> 52:47.097
( groans )

52:47.198 --> 52:48.933
I'VE GOT TO GET
YOU TWO BOYS IN A HOLE.

52:49.033 --> 52:51.536
YOU'RE STINKING UP
THE DODGE.

52:55.373 --> 52:58.343
( engine starts )

53:11.756 --> 53:13.958
( knife tapping )

53:14.058 --> 53:16.827
HOW COULD YOU?

53:16.927 --> 53:19.964
HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT TO ME?

53:20.064 --> 53:22.500
WHAT, DEAR?

53:26.504 --> 53:27.972
PENANCE?

53:28.072 --> 53:32.410
ONLY WITH SACRIFICE
COMES REDEMPTION.

53:33.844 --> 53:37.715
- ( speaks in Russian )
- MOTHER IS DEAD!

53:59.637 --> 54:01.439
MUCH OBLIGED!

54:05.042 --> 54:07.345
( elephant trumpeting )

54:13.217 --> 54:15.052
OKAY, CHILDREN!

54:15.152 --> 54:18.022
LET'S SHAKE SOME DUST!

54:23.227 --> 54:25.463
( engines starting )

55:43.374 --> 55:47.445
( theme music playing )
