WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:09.635
Commander!

00:09.709 --> 00:11.142
Look at this.

00:11.211 --> 00:12.644
l think they're
some kind of apple.

00:12.712 --> 00:13.644
Hmm.

00:13.713 --> 00:14.975
There are trees filled with them

00:15.048 --> 00:17.312
as far as the eye can see,
just over that ridge.

00:17.384 --> 00:18.976
Kaylos. Ah.

00:19.052 --> 00:22.317
Aren't they gorgeous?

00:22.389 --> 00:23.788
One bite'll kill you.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.087
Puff you up like a vakol fish.

00:26.159 --> 00:30.152
Yeah, first your windpipe
swells...

00:30.230 --> 00:31.322
and just when you think

00:31.398 --> 00:33.491
you're going to die
of suffocation...

00:33.566 --> 00:36.467
Ow! Oh, you get a sharp pain
in your knees,

00:36.536 --> 00:40.199
which begins to work
its way right up to...

00:40.273 --> 00:42.571
l think we get the picture.

00:42.642 --> 00:44.041
Sorry, Mr. Carey.

00:44.110 --> 00:47.477
Just remember
the old trader's axiom:

00:47.547 --> 00:50.414
Never judge a fruit by its skin.

00:50.483 --> 00:53.213
On the other hand,
huh, take a bite.

00:53.286 --> 00:54.719
What is it?

00:54.788 --> 00:56.585
A leola root.

01:00.927 --> 01:03.020
You expect us to eat this?

01:03.096 --> 01:06.156
This is the reason
l brought you here, Commander.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.597
There's no better source

01:07.667 --> 01:09.259
of vitamins and minerals
in the Quadrant

01:09.335 --> 01:10.927
than in this,
this ugly little root.

01:11.037 --> 01:14.370
l'd find the second-best source
acceptable if it tasted better.

01:15.508 --> 01:16.702
You humans!

01:16.776 --> 01:19.438
You're not used to roughing it,
are you?

01:19.512 --> 01:21.605
Well, take it
from one who knows.

01:21.681 --> 01:24.081
The day may come
when you'll relish

01:24.150 --> 01:25.981
every last crunch of leola.

01:28.188 --> 01:30.850
Stewed for a few hours
in a light herbal broth,

01:30.924 --> 01:32.892
ah, you won't even notice
the mildew.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:41.034 --> 01:44.663
Captain, l don't
think we're alone.

01:44.737 --> 01:47.297
Mr. Tuvok, run a lateral
EM scan for me,

01:47.373 --> 01:50.809
coordinates 81 mark 40.

01:50.877 --> 01:53.038
Running scan.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.273
What do you see, Mr. Paris?

01:54.347 --> 01:56.713
lt's like a reflection.

01:56.783 --> 01:57.909
Something in low orbit.

01:57.984 --> 01:59.849
When it moves into
a certain angle from the sun...

01:59.919 --> 02:00.886
He's correct.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.081
l am picking up
an ionization trail.

02:03.156 --> 02:05.090
There is another ship in orbit.

02:05.158 --> 02:06.921
Using some kind
of cloaking device?

02:06.993 --> 02:10.086
lt's not a cloaking device
as we know it, Captain.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.562
l cannot say for certain
what it is,

02:11.631 --> 02:13.792
but the ship does employ
some kind of masking circuitry

02:13.867 --> 02:15.061
that has affected our sensors.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.363
Voyager to away team.

02:16.436 --> 02:17.926
Go ahead, Captain.

02:18.071 --> 02:21.006
Any unexpected life signs
down there, Commander?

02:23.476 --> 02:25.171
Nothing but bloodworms.

02:25.245 --> 02:27.679
Neelix wants to bring
some back for a tartar

02:27.747 --> 02:29.180
he wants to make.

02:29.249 --> 02:30.443
l'm trying
to talk him out of it.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.576
We're picking up an unidentified
ship in low orbit.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.643
Collect your teams,
and prepare to transport back

02:34.721 --> 02:35.847
while we investigate.

02:35.922 --> 02:36.854
Acknowledged.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.618
Chakotay out.

02:38.691 --> 02:42.718
All units, report
to transport site A immediately.

02:42.795 --> 02:44.763
Captain, l believe
a polaron burst

02:44.831 --> 02:46.423
may give us visual contact.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.228
Do it.

02:54.073 --> 02:55.836
Kazon.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.036
The hull design does conform
to known specifications

02:58.111 --> 02:59.169
of the Kazon-Nistrim sect.

02:59.245 --> 03:00.439
Voyager to away teams.

03:00.513 --> 03:01.571
Return to the ship immediately.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.912
Acknowledged, Captain.

03:03.983 --> 03:07.146
Transporter Room, get ready
to begin on my command.

03:07.220 --> 03:08.585
Where is Ensign Seska?

03:10.590 --> 03:12.285
Chakotay to Seska.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.723
Transporter Room, can you locate
Ensign Seska's combadge signal?

03:16.796 --> 03:17.922
Negative, Commander.

03:17.997 --> 03:20.158
l'm not reading any sign of her.

03:20.233 --> 03:22.565
She was picking berries
with our group,

03:22.635 --> 03:24.102
over by the hillside.

03:24.170 --> 03:25.694
There were caves nearby.

03:25.772 --> 03:26.796
lf she went inside one,

03:26.873 --> 03:28.738
it might be blocking
her combadge signal.

03:28.808 --> 03:30.503
The rest of you get
back to the ship.

03:30.577 --> 03:31.874
l'm going to look for her.

04:44.517 --> 04:45.779
Oh, thank the Prophets!

04:45.852 --> 04:47.149
What are you doing here?

04:47.220 --> 04:49.916
Mushrooms. l saw them growing
by the mouth of the cave.

04:49.989 --> 04:52.981
l wanted to teach Neelix
how to make your favorite soup.

04:53.092 --> 04:56.357
l appreciate the thought, but
we've got to get out of here.

07:00.586 --> 07:04.579
Captain's Log, Stardate 48658.2.

07:04.657 --> 07:06.284
We successfully left orbit

07:06.359 --> 07:08.850
without further interference
from the Kazon.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.158
Commander Chakotay was injured

07:11.230 --> 07:13.790
but is recovering
from his wounds.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.405
Come in.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.904
l didn't think l'd make it.

07:25.978 --> 07:27.240
Feeling better?

07:27.313 --> 07:29.873
Yeah.
What have you got there?

07:32.819 --> 07:34.446
Real food.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.784
You got Neelix to make
some mushroom soup.

07:36.856 --> 07:37.880
Are you kidding?

07:37.957 --> 07:40.152
The man wanted
to stretch the mushrooms

07:40.226 --> 07:41.420
with just a little...

07:41.494 --> 07:42.791
- leola root.
- Leola root.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.227
We got into this tug of war

07:44.297 --> 07:46.356
with the bag of mushrooms
in the middle.

07:46.432 --> 07:48.866
lt was the most ludicrous
thing you've ever seen.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.368
Tuvok and Kes broke us up,

07:50.436 --> 07:52.802
and then Neelix
threw me out of his kitchen.

07:52.872 --> 07:53.861
So, how did you...?

07:53.940 --> 07:55.271
Mm, strictly a Maquis operation.

07:55.341 --> 07:56.365
Hmm!

07:56.442 --> 07:59.969
First, we arranged
for a little morale crisis.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.343
A couple of our people

08:01.380 --> 08:04.178
suddenly came down
with severe homesickness.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.343
Neelix, our devoted
morale officer,

08:06.419 --> 08:09.980
responded to the call
and came in to cheer them up,

08:10.056 --> 08:12.718
and while they were
all singing Rakan folk songs,

08:12.792 --> 08:15.056
Jackson and l
broke into the kitchen.

08:17.797 --> 08:20.027
You looted the food reserves?

08:20.099 --> 08:24.263
Well, if he's not going
to give us a decent meal...

08:26.606 --> 08:28.437
l can't believe you did this.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.602
Well, it's not like
we're hiding anything.

08:31.677 --> 08:35.113
l did bring soup straight
to the First Officer, didn't l?

08:35.181 --> 08:38.344
Thanks for including me
in a criminal conspiracy.

08:38.417 --> 08:40.248
Does he know about this yet?

08:40.318 --> 08:44.449
Well, the morale crisis ended
a few minutes ago, so l'd say...

08:44.524 --> 08:46.014
Neelix to Chakotay.

08:46.092 --> 08:48.424
...that he probably does.

08:48.494 --> 08:49.927
Go ahead, Neelix.

08:49.996 --> 08:51.588
l'd like to report a crime.

08:51.664 --> 08:53.427
Someone has broken into
my kitchen and stolen food--

08:53.499 --> 08:56.468
taken food out of the mouths
of their crewmates.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.503
l know.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.162
lt was that Seska, wasn't it?

08:59.238 --> 09:02.173
l promise you everyone involved
will be disciplined.

09:02.241 --> 09:04.971
lf you'd like my recommendations
for punishment...

09:05.044 --> 09:06.705
Thank you.
l'll handle that.

09:06.779 --> 09:08.406
Chakotay out.

09:10.149 --> 09:13.084
Replicator privileges
revoked for two days.

09:13.152 --> 09:14.676
Everyone, including me.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.483
They're not going to do it.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.389
Then l'll personally
put them in the brig.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.892
You'd put me in the brig?

09:23.229 --> 09:25.663
After all we've been through?

09:32.538 --> 09:35.200
The soup was worth losing
the replicator privileges

09:35.274 --> 09:38.300
for two days-- admit it.

09:38.377 --> 09:39.867
That's not the point.

09:39.979 --> 09:42.311
l get the point.

09:42.381 --> 09:44.076
Can we make up now?

09:49.655 --> 09:52.886
Who else knows how to make
your favorite soup like l do?

09:52.959 --> 09:54.927
No one...

09:54.994 --> 09:58.054
but we agreed a long time ago,
this wouldn't work.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.596
Look around, Chakotay.

10:04.670 --> 10:08.037
There aren't that many
potential mates out here.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.403
Of course, if you're
not interested...

10:16.482 --> 10:19.918
l have had my eye
on young Ensign Kim.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.456
Janeway to all senior officers.

10:27.526 --> 10:29.687
Please report to the Bridge.

10:31.364 --> 10:36.165
We require help... immediately!

10:36.235 --> 10:40.137
Anyone who can hear
this message, please help!

10:40.206 --> 10:41.571
Long-range scanners

10:41.641 --> 10:43.199
picked up the distress signal
three minutes ago.

10:43.275 --> 10:45.607
The ship's
dimensions are identical

10:45.678 --> 10:47.270
to the vessel
we encountered at the planet.

10:47.346 --> 10:48.711
lt is a Kazon-Nistrim
ship, Captain.

10:48.781 --> 10:51.443
Captain, this may be a trap.

10:51.517 --> 10:55.283
The Kazon-Nistrim is one
of the most violent sects

10:55.354 --> 10:56.981
in the entire Kazon Collective.

10:57.056 --> 10:59.320
We need immediate assistance!

10:59.392 --> 11:03.522
We have lost
all Bridge operations.

11:03.596 --> 11:06.497
Barely able to function.

11:06.565 --> 11:09.932
Please... assist!

11:10.069 --> 11:12.765
Mr. Kim, can you determine

11:12.838 --> 11:15.807
if this ship
has sustained genuine damage?

11:15.875 --> 11:18.309
There are fluctuating
nucleonic patterns.

11:18.377 --> 11:21.312
lt might indicate
a reactor breakdown on board.

11:21.380 --> 11:24.679
Mr. Paris, run an extended
scanner sequence

11:24.750 --> 11:26.650
to identify
any other Kazon ships

11:26.719 --> 11:28.016
that might be in the area.

11:29.255 --> 11:30.984
Nothing showing up, Captain.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.752
Maintain scans
and set a heading to intercept.

11:33.826 --> 11:35.259
New heading entered.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.454
l take your warning seriously,
Neelix,

11:37.530 --> 11:41.466
and will act with caution,
but if we can help, we should.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.002
Besides,
this may be an opportunity

11:44.070 --> 11:47.767
to make a friend,
and out here,

11:47.840 --> 11:51.207
we can use all the friends
we can get.

12:45.798 --> 12:48.266
What could do
something like this?

12:48.334 --> 12:51.269
l'm showing high levels
of nucleonic radiation.

12:51.337 --> 12:54.829
lt seems to be isolated
in that area.

12:54.907 --> 12:55.999
lt is likely that the ship's

12:56.142 --> 12:58.042
automatic containment
systems were activated

12:58.110 --> 13:00.840
when the radiation
entered the Bridge.

13:00.913 --> 13:03.074
We should be safe
as long as we stay

13:03.149 --> 13:04.844
on this side of the force field.

13:10.589 --> 13:13.285
Someone's alive over here.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.501
Away team to Voyager.

13:25.571 --> 13:28.165
We've got a single male Kazon
alive on the Bridge.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.071
Transport him
directly to Sick Bay.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.007
Energizing.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.908
lt appears the explosion
emanated from this console.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.280
Something look a little odd
about it to you?

13:39.351 --> 13:41.376
The structural pattern
does not conform

13:41.453 --> 13:42.784
to the rest of the Bridge.

13:42.855 --> 13:45.085
No, there's something
else strange about it.

13:45.157 --> 13:48.991
The residue has a .41 percent
trace of a neosorium composite,

13:49.061 --> 13:52.258
and l don't know anyone
who uses neosorium technology,

13:52.331 --> 13:54.492
except for the Federation.

13:54.567 --> 13:58.503
So how did it get
into the hands of the Kazon?

14:02.474 --> 14:04.203
lncredible.

14:04.276 --> 14:08.076
Somehow, virtually every cell
in his body has been altered.

14:08.147 --> 14:09.580
Altered?

14:09.648 --> 14:11.172
His cells have mutated,

14:11.250 --> 14:14.048
or they've been fused
with inorganic matter.

14:14.119 --> 14:15.313
l can't make heads
or tails of it.

14:15.387 --> 14:16.445
Look at this.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.047
His blood cells have bonded
with metallic nuclei.

14:19.124 --> 14:21.285
The crew members
closest to the explosion

14:21.360 --> 14:22.486
were virtually melded

14:22.561 --> 14:24.461
with huge pieces
of metal fragments.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.157
He was luckier than the others.

14:26.232 --> 14:28.427
That remains to be seen.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.593
l'm going to have to do
a complete pyrocyte replacement

14:30.669 --> 14:31.931
if we're going
to keep him alive.

14:32.004 --> 14:35.269
We'd better hope there are
compatible donors on board.

14:35.341 --> 14:37.639
l'll run a cytological
screening of the crew.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.907
We'll let you know the results
as soon as we can.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.776
Captain, there was an apparent
Federation signature

14:46.852 --> 14:47.841
to the explosion.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.114
What?

14:49.188 --> 14:51.122
lt looked like
they were trying to install

14:51.190 --> 14:52.817
some new technology
that detonated.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.416
You're saying
they have some kind

14:54.493 --> 14:55.892
of Federation weapon on board?

14:55.961 --> 14:58.555
A console on the Bridge
was the source of the explosion.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.189
We're not sure
what its function was,

15:00.266 --> 15:01.858
and it's going
to be hard to get to.

15:01.967 --> 15:03.366
We can't transport it out?

15:03.435 --> 15:07.269
Not with those levels
of nucleonic radiation.

15:07.339 --> 15:08.670
The transporter beam
would disperse

15:08.741 --> 15:10.231
the moment it hit
the irradiated cabin.

15:10.309 --> 15:12.504
How could they possibly
have Federation technology?

15:12.578 --> 15:13.909
There are only
three alternatives

15:14.013 --> 15:15.503
l can discern at this time.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.913
One: lt is not
Federation technology at all

15:17.983 --> 15:20.281
but something similar.

15:20.352 --> 15:21.478
Bridge.

15:21.553 --> 15:23.748
Two:
Another Federation starship

15:23.822 --> 15:25.813
may have been brought
to the Delta Quadrant

15:25.891 --> 15:26.915
prior to our arrival,

15:26.992 --> 15:29.187
and they interacted
with the Kazon-Nistrim.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.922
Were there any other reports
of missing starships?

15:30.996 --> 15:32.588
Not to my knowledge.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.826
Three: Someone from this ship

15:34.900 --> 15:36.925
has covertly given technology
to the Kazon.

15:37.002 --> 15:39.596
Computer, hold turbolift.

15:42.007 --> 15:44.669
l don't like
number three at all, Tuvok.

15:44.743 --> 15:47.803
Nevertheless, it is the most
probable explanation.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.279
lt may not be a coincidence

15:49.348 --> 15:51.976
that the Kazon ship
we encountered at the planet

15:52.051 --> 15:53.746
was able to deceive our sensors.

15:53.819 --> 15:56.083
Perhaps someone transmitted
instructions to them

15:56.155 --> 15:57.417
before we arrived.

15:59.658 --> 16:00.784
l want you to personally

16:00.893 --> 16:02.861
go through
the transmission logs, Tuvok.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.692
Compare them
to the actual telemetry.

16:04.763 --> 16:08.494
See if there's any evidence
of prior contact with the Kazon.

16:08.567 --> 16:10.467
Who would have had a chance
to meet with them

16:10.536 --> 16:11.798
while you were on the surface?

16:11.870 --> 16:12.859
A dozen people.

16:12.938 --> 16:14.496
We were scattered
all over the area.

16:14.573 --> 16:17.337
You did discover Ensign Seska
in proximity to them.

16:17.409 --> 16:20.674
Seska almost killed me
because she thought l was Kazon.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.907
She wouldn't
do something like this.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.917
Nevertheless, l urge you
to regard her with caution

16:25.985 --> 16:27.111
for the time being.

16:29.455 --> 16:32.913
Why would anyone
on this ship betray us?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.756
We're all in this together.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.456
We need to retrieve that console
and get some answers

16:38.530 --> 16:40.521
before the rumors
get out of hand.

16:40.599 --> 16:42.567
Computer, resume.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.664
Releasing the force field
isn't an option.

16:49.742 --> 16:52.575
That would just allow the
radiation into the whole cabin.

16:52.644 --> 16:54.805
We could generate
a localized subspace bubble

16:54.880 --> 16:56.211
to get past the force field.

16:56.281 --> 16:58.681
One minor subspace disruption
and you're dead.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.082
lt's too risky.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.346
l'd be willing to risk it.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.148
We could use an expander

17:05.223 --> 17:07.282
to manipulate
the containment field.

17:08.460 --> 17:09.551
Manipulate it how?

17:10.963 --> 17:12.555
Move it out of the way.

17:12.631 --> 17:15.691
Rotate the field, and the
radiation trapped inside it

17:15.768 --> 17:16.859
away from the console.

17:16.935 --> 17:19.233
Once it's clear, we have access.

17:19.304 --> 17:21.771
How long will it
take to set this up?

17:21.839 --> 17:25.105
We, uh, we should be able
to make an attempt by tomorrow.

17:25.176 --> 17:26.769
l want it ready
by the end of the day.

17:26.845 --> 17:28.005
No, Captain.

17:28.079 --> 17:30.640
When l say tomorrow,
l mean tomorrow.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.910
l don't exaggerate.

17:32.017 --> 17:34.315
Tomorrow is the best l can do.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.978
Understood, Lieutenant.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.389
All right...

17:39.458 --> 17:41.926
we'll begin on the Kazon Bridge.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.859
Carey, Nicoletti, Seska.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.794
No. l want Ensign Seska

17:45.864 --> 17:49.459
to coordinate the operation
from our Bridge.

17:49.535 --> 17:51.833
Okay, Henard, you're with us.

17:51.904 --> 17:52.996
Dismissed.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.268
What was that all about?

17:57.342 --> 17:58.309
What?

17:58.377 --> 17:59.639
Oh, you know
what l'm talking about.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.303
There's nothing important
to do on the Bridge.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.846
l disagree.
We need someone up there...

18:02.881 --> 18:04.610
What the hell is going on?

18:08.654 --> 18:10.144
There's some concern about you.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.052
What kind of concern?

18:15.127 --> 18:18.358
Concern because l found you
near the Kazon on the planet.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.863
Oh, l see.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.399
So now l'm a traitor.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.298
l sell technology to the enemy?

18:23.368 --> 18:24.630
-l don't believe that.
-No, you just take me

18:24.703 --> 18:26.193
off my assignment.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.739
l'm trying to take you out
of harm's way to protect you.

18:28.807 --> 18:29.865
This is your idea of protection?

18:29.975 --> 18:31.340
You might as well
point a finger at me

18:31.410 --> 18:32.502
in front of the entire crew.

18:32.578 --> 18:34.739
You don't assign someone
you don't trust to the Bridge.

18:37.015 --> 18:38.482
Look, l'm sorry,

18:38.550 --> 18:40.780
but if something goes wrong
over there, l don't want you

18:40.853 --> 18:42.411
anywhere near it.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.649
Thanks for your concern.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.697
How is he?

18:56.768 --> 18:58.395
Not very good.

18:58.470 --> 19:01.633
We need to completely
replace his blood.

19:12.351 --> 19:15.445
Will he regain consciousness?

19:15.521 --> 19:16.852
l'm not sure.

19:16.922 --> 19:18.856
Even if he does,
there's no way to predict

19:18.924 --> 19:22.724
what kind of brain damage
there might be.

19:22.794 --> 19:24.261
He's the only one
who really knows

19:24.329 --> 19:26.490
what happened on that ship,
Doctor.

19:26.565 --> 19:29.864
The only one who can tell them
l had nothing to do with it.

19:29.968 --> 19:31.458
You? l don't understand.

19:31.537 --> 19:33.767
Would you call me
right away if he wakes up?

19:33.839 --> 19:35.807
All right.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.744
Ensign...

19:41.813 --> 19:42.745
did you ever come in

19:42.814 --> 19:45.044
to leave a blood sample on file?

19:45.117 --> 19:48.644
No. l never got around to it.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.017
Why?

19:50.088 --> 19:52.784
l've been running a crew
compatibility analysis,

19:52.858 --> 19:54.189
and your file never came up.

19:54.259 --> 19:55.749
My blood won't help you.

19:55.827 --> 19:58.261
l had a childhood disease
that infected it.

19:58.330 --> 20:01.128
l was warned never to donate
blood for a transfusion.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.192
All the more reason we should
have your blood on file.

20:05.337 --> 20:06.463
l will.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.166
Right now, l have something
more important to take care of.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.436
Someone did make
an unauthorized transmission.

20:14.513 --> 20:16.981
And whoever it was was an expert
at covering their tracks.

20:17.082 --> 20:19.516
The signal was masked
by a test of the dorsal emitters

20:19.585 --> 20:20.882
that we conducted a week ago.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.215
Who was working on that test?

20:22.287 --> 20:23.481
Only the whole Engineering crew.

20:23.555 --> 20:24.886
We're trying
to trace the station

20:24.957 --> 20:26.083
where the signal originated.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.853
Again, the perpetrator
was skilled enough

20:27.926 --> 20:30.326
to make the tracking process
extremely difficult for us.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.955
lt's like working backwards
through a maze of circuits.

20:33.031 --> 20:34.464
We keep bumping into dead ends.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.125
Paris to Captain Janeway.

20:36.201 --> 20:38.431
Please report to the Bridge.

20:41.707 --> 20:43.538
Captain, another Kazon ship
is approaching,

20:43.609 --> 20:44.974
trying to hail
the disabled ship.

20:45.043 --> 20:46.510
They're not
within visual range yet.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.637
Perhaps someone else
picked up the distress call.

20:48.714 --> 20:50.705
What's their ETA?

20:50.782 --> 20:52.977
At their current speed,
four hours, 20 minutes.

20:53.051 --> 20:54.484
Should l tell them we're here?

20:54.553 --> 20:55.884
lf we know about them,

20:55.954 --> 20:58.684
it's a good bet
they know about us.

20:58.757 --> 21:01.920
We don't have anything good
to tell them.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.518
l think we'll wait.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.756
Captain, l'm showing
an unauthorized autosequence

21:05.831 --> 21:06.763
in Transporter Room 2.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.925
Someone's left Voyager.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.162
Computer, identify
who just beamed off the ship

21:11.236 --> 21:12.362
from Transporter Room 2.

21:12.437 --> 21:13.768
Ensign Seska.

21:28.553 --> 21:30.077
Chakotay to Seska.

21:30.155 --> 21:31.554
l really don't have time

21:31.623 --> 21:33.648
to talk to you right now,
Chakotay.

21:33.725 --> 21:34.987
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

21:35.093 --> 21:37.084
Retrieving the console, my way.

21:37.162 --> 21:39.357
l want you back on this ship,
and l mean now.

21:39.431 --> 21:41.524
The Captain said she wanted
the console today.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.625
Carey's plan
couldn't do it in time,

21:43.702 --> 21:44.964
but mine can.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.299
Captain, it is conceivable

21:46.371 --> 21:47.998
that she has gone
to the Kazon ship

21:48.140 --> 21:50.040
to destroy evidence
that might implicate her.

21:50.108 --> 21:52.099
She's gone back to the Kazon
ship to prove herself to us.

21:52.177 --> 21:53.303
Can't you see that?

21:53.378 --> 21:54.504
l've got a lock on her, Captain.

21:54.579 --> 21:55.910
Do you want me
to transport her back?

21:55.981 --> 21:57.380
lf we try to beam her out

21:57.449 --> 21:59.349
while she's
manipulating subspace,

21:59.418 --> 22:00.476
we might kill her.

22:03.588 --> 22:05.886
Chakotay to Seska.

22:05.957 --> 22:09.085
Seska, respond.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.253
Get her out of there!

22:10.329 --> 22:11.853
Send her to Sick Bay.

22:11.930 --> 22:13.625
Energizing.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.766
Prep 3cc's kelotane.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.137
l'll need a dermal regenerator.

22:23.208 --> 22:25.142
Run a full blood scan.

22:42.527 --> 22:45.155
Have a seat, Mr. Carey.

22:53.071 --> 22:56.734
How have things been going
for you in Engineering?

22:56.808 --> 22:58.139
Fine.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.804
Why, is there a problem?

23:00.879 --> 23:03.780
You getting along all right
with Lieutenant Torres?

23:03.849 --> 23:06.579
l think we've settled
our differences.

23:06.651 --> 23:08.585
She was promoted
to Chief Engineer

23:08.653 --> 23:09.881
over you, Lieutenant.

23:09.955 --> 23:11.286
That might be difficult

23:11.356 --> 23:13.654
for someone in your position
to accept.

23:13.725 --> 23:17.252
Captain, l accepted
your decision,

23:17.329 --> 23:18.796
and l've worked as hard as l can

23:18.864 --> 23:22.027
to make myself a valuable member
of Lieutenant Torres' team.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.568
l can't believe
she'd have any complaints

23:24.636 --> 23:25.898
about my performance.

23:25.971 --> 23:27.336
She doesn't.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.739
Then what am l doing here?

23:32.177 --> 23:34.304
Lieutenant,
have you had any contact

23:34.379 --> 23:35.710
with the Kazon-Nistrim

23:35.781 --> 23:38.113
since we arrived
in the Delta Quadrant?

23:38.183 --> 23:40.947
What?!

23:41.019 --> 23:42.919
Y-You mean, me personally?

23:45.357 --> 23:47.791
No. Of course not.

23:47.859 --> 23:49.918
You were out of contact
for almost an hour

23:49.995 --> 23:52.259
on the planet
where we encountered the Kazon.

23:52.330 --> 23:55.993
You mean, when l was picking
those poison apples?

23:56.067 --> 23:57.796
What about before
we arrived at the planet?

23:57.869 --> 24:01.134
Did you have any reason
to signal a Kazon-Nistrim ship?

24:01.206 --> 24:02.867
-No.
-Nevertheless,

24:02.941 --> 24:05.637
a signal was sent to the Kazon
from your station in Engineering

24:05.710 --> 24:08.008
during our dorsal emitter test
last week.

24:08.079 --> 24:09.273
My station?

24:09.347 --> 24:11.440
Were you not in Engineering
at that time?

24:11.516 --> 24:15.077
Well, yes, l was, but...

24:15.153 --> 24:17.815
you know how it is down there
during a systems analysis.

24:17.889 --> 24:19.447
Did you see anyone else
at your station?

24:19.524 --> 24:21.424
Honestly, l don't remember.

24:21.493 --> 24:23.552
Maybe you should ask Seska.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.061
Why Seska?

24:25.130 --> 24:29.726
Everybody knows she was found
in the cave with the Kazon.

24:39.211 --> 24:43.375
Look, l'm not saying
she did anything wrong,

24:43.448 --> 24:45.473
but l didn't either.

24:45.550 --> 24:48.644
l'd like to believe you,
Mr. Carey,

24:48.720 --> 24:51.883
but somebody did contact
the Kazon,

24:51.957 --> 24:53.151
and until we know who,

24:53.225 --> 24:56.319
l'm going to have
to restrict you to quarters.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.664
What do you think?

25:11.943 --> 25:14.571
He had the motive
and the opportunity.

25:14.646 --> 25:17.615
He's also had a distinguished
Starfleet career.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.912
Seska spent most
of the last two years

25:19.985 --> 25:21.577
as an enemy of the Federation.

25:21.653 --> 25:22.847
So have l.

25:27.926 --> 25:30.224
Captain, we're being hailed
by the approaching Kazon ship.

25:30.295 --> 25:31.523
How soon will they be here?

25:31.596 --> 25:32.654
Four minutes.

25:32.731 --> 25:34.494
l wish we had something
more definitive to tell them.

25:34.566 --> 25:36.033
Open a channel.

25:38.436 --> 25:40.404
l am Kathryn Janeway,

25:40.472 --> 25:43.441
Captain of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

25:43.508 --> 25:47.911
My name is Culluh,
First Maje of the Kazon-Nistrim.

25:47.979 --> 25:51.107
What have you done to our ship?

25:52.450 --> 25:54.941
We responded to a call for help.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.147
Unfortunately, by the time
we were able to respond,

25:57.222 --> 25:59.816
all but one of the crew
were dead.

25:59.891 --> 26:02.689
l would like to speak
to the survivor.

26:02.794 --> 26:04.659
He hasn't
regained consciousness.

26:04.696 --> 26:05.856
We have him in our Sick Bay.

26:05.931 --> 26:08.365
We'd be happy to beam you aboard
so you can see him.

26:08.433 --> 26:11.129
You will prepare for my arrival.

26:12.871 --> 26:14.566
Friendly sort.

26:24.716 --> 26:26.843
Ah, Captain,
l'm glad you're here.

26:26.918 --> 26:29.148
l was just about to call you.

26:29.220 --> 26:32.189
Doctor, this is
First Maje Culluh,

26:32.257 --> 26:33.246
of the Kazon-Nistrim.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.555
Could you give us
the latest condition report

26:35.627 --> 26:36.924
on your Kazon patient?

26:36.995 --> 26:38.053
Well, the good news is,

26:38.129 --> 26:39.289
we've been able
to stabilize him.

26:39.364 --> 26:42.697
We had to completely
replace his blood.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.530
Replace his blood?

26:44.603 --> 26:46.298
With what?

26:46.371 --> 26:48.703
The blood of volunteers
from our crew.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.365
They saved his life.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.501
His own blood cells
were killing him.

26:52.577 --> 26:55.808
They were changed
by the accident on his ship.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.507
Changed in what manner?

26:57.582 --> 27:00.710
We haven't been able
to determine that yet.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.047
We've been working on a plan

27:02.120 --> 27:04.213
to access the source
of the explosion,

27:04.289 --> 27:06.780
which should answer
a lot of the questions.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.687
That will no longer
be necessary.

27:08.760 --> 27:12.218
We will take the damaged vessel
to our port for inspection.

27:12.297 --> 27:16.393
l'm afraid l can't allow you
to do that just yet.

27:16.468 --> 27:20.370
And what gives you the right
to interfere in our affairs?

27:20.438 --> 27:23.168
There was a trace
of a Federation compound

27:23.241 --> 27:25.334
in the remains of the explosion.

27:25.410 --> 27:26.968
We have reason to believe

27:27.045 --> 27:30.139
that someone on board
this ship gave technology

27:30.215 --> 27:31.341
to your people.

27:31.416 --> 27:34.908
Until we have a better
explanation of what occurred,

27:34.986 --> 27:37.011
l can't release
that ship to you.

27:37.088 --> 27:38.715
That is not acceptable.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.621
lt will have to be.

27:40.692 --> 27:44.924
Your unique technologies
make you brave, Captain,

27:44.996 --> 27:47.328
but you have only one ship.

27:47.399 --> 27:48.923
ln less than a day,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.935
there will be four Kazon vessels
off your bow.

27:52.003 --> 27:55.029
Perhaps by then,
we'll have the answers we need.

27:55.106 --> 27:57.574
You will leave us with him.

28:06.751 --> 28:08.981
l assume they'll want
to take him back to their ship.

28:09.054 --> 28:10.646
l'd rather not let them
do it just yet--

28:10.722 --> 28:12.053
in case he regains
consciousness.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.852
There are a lot of questions
he can answer.

28:13.925 --> 28:15.688
Can l tell them
it's not safe to move him?

28:15.760 --> 28:17.091
lt would be the truth.

28:17.162 --> 28:18.129
Good.

28:32.110 --> 28:33.543
He's dead.

28:33.611 --> 28:35.841
Get off this ship.

28:39.684 --> 28:42.653
There was some kind of nerve
toxin in that needle.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.018
He died instantly.

28:48.259 --> 28:52.025
Captain, may we talk to you
in my office?

28:58.336 --> 28:59.894
lt's about Seska.

28:59.971 --> 29:01.768
Complications?

29:01.873 --> 29:06.207
l was analyzing her blood
chemistry to try to locate

29:06.244 --> 29:08.303
a compatible donor.

29:08.379 --> 29:11.109
But when l got the results,
her blood was lacking

29:11.182 --> 29:13.275
all the common
Bajoran blood factors.

29:13.351 --> 29:14.545
Meaning?

29:14.619 --> 29:15.847
The only conclusion we can reach

29:15.920 --> 29:17.785
is that she is not,
in fact, Bajoran.

29:17.856 --> 29:21.257
lt appears Seska has been
genetically altered.

29:21.326 --> 29:25.228
My suspicion is
she was born Cardassian.

29:35.740 --> 29:36.866
You're asking me to believe

29:37.008 --> 29:39.408
she's a Cardassian agent
who infiltrated the Maquis?

29:39.477 --> 29:41.707
Starfleet Security has
documented several incidents

29:41.780 --> 29:44.214
in which Cardassians
have used cosmetic alterations

29:44.282 --> 29:46.045
for the purpose
of infiltrating an enemy.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.244
This is crazy.
This is just impossible.

29:48.319 --> 29:50.446
The Doctor has informed us that

29:50.522 --> 29:51.819
there is no other
plausible explanation

29:51.890 --> 29:53.152
for the medical anomalies,
Commander.

29:53.224 --> 29:55.692
lf you don't mind, l'd like
to hear her explanation before

29:55.760 --> 29:56.749
we dismiss it.

29:56.828 --> 29:59.092
-Has she been told?
-No.

29:59.164 --> 30:00.688
l'd like to be the one
who questions her.

30:00.765 --> 30:04.098
l suggest we wait
until we retrieve the console.

30:04.169 --> 30:05.636
Janeway to Torres.

30:05.703 --> 30:06.635
Yes, Captain.

30:06.704 --> 30:07.932
Your status.

30:08.039 --> 30:10.701
We are finished
with the computer simulations.

30:10.775 --> 30:12.936
Everything looks okay.
We're ready to beam over.

30:13.044 --> 30:15.877
Good. Then let's get started.
Janeway out.

30:15.947 --> 30:19.110
You were working for her;
Seska was working for them.

30:19.184 --> 30:21.880
Was anyone on board
that ship working for me?

30:21.953 --> 30:23.944
The Kazon ship is hailing us.

30:24.022 --> 30:25.489
Open a channel.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.959
On screen.

30:29.027 --> 30:32.588
Our sensors show that you are
trespassing on our vessel.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.292
As l've already informed you,
we're attempting

30:35.366 --> 30:38.301
to retrieve the console
that caused this explosion.

30:38.369 --> 30:41.998
lf you attempt to remove
anything from our ship,

30:42.140 --> 30:44.370
it will be considered
an act of war.

30:44.442 --> 30:47.411
You know, l'm really easy
to get along with

30:47.478 --> 30:49.446
most of the time...

30:49.514 --> 30:52.642
but l don't like bullies,
and l don't like threats,

30:52.717 --> 30:55.982
and l don't like you, Culluh.

31:00.258 --> 31:03.352
You can try and stop us
from getting to the truth,

31:03.428 --> 31:05.589
but l promise you, if you do,

31:05.663 --> 31:08.757
l will respond with
all the ''unique'' technologies

31:08.833 --> 31:10.266
at my command.

31:10.335 --> 31:12.166
Janeway out.

31:12.237 --> 31:14.501
Their weapons systems
are standing down.

31:14.572 --> 31:17.666
They do not appear to be posing
a threat to us at this time.

31:17.742 --> 31:19.937
At least not until
reinforcements get here.

31:20.011 --> 31:21.035
Janeway to away team.

31:21.112 --> 31:22.204
Yes, Captain?

31:22.280 --> 31:23.941
l don't want to rush you,
Lieutenant, but...

31:24.015 --> 31:25.448
We're finished, Captain.

31:25.516 --> 31:26.949
l beg your pardon?

31:27.018 --> 31:29.282
Decontamination
went exactly as planned.

31:29.354 --> 31:32.152
The console has been transported
to Engineering,

31:32.223 --> 31:33.690
and we're on our way back now.

31:33.758 --> 31:34.782
Acknowledged.

31:34.859 --> 31:36.349
Well done, away team.

31:36.427 --> 31:38.258
We'll meet you in Engineering.

31:50.475 --> 31:53.774
Of all the things to die for.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.846
lt's a food replicator...

31:57.916 --> 32:01.044
or at least it was trying to be.

32:01.119 --> 32:03.587
We may take replicators
for granted,

32:03.655 --> 32:05.680
but imagine what it would mean

32:05.757 --> 32:08.783
to a culture that doesn't have
this technology.

32:08.860 --> 32:11.920
They didn't use a thick enough
interior shield casing.

32:11.996 --> 32:14.430
Once the nucleonic radiation
leaked out,

32:14.499 --> 32:16.626
a cascade reaction
was inevitable.

32:16.701 --> 32:19.795
Can you tell if any part of
the console came from our ship?

32:19.871 --> 32:21.532
There's no doubt about it,
Captain.

32:21.606 --> 32:23.233
The pattern buffer relays

32:23.308 --> 32:25.799
are clearly composed
of bio-neural fibers.

32:25.877 --> 32:28.345
No other Federation ship
would have them.

32:28.413 --> 32:33.578
Somebody on board Voyager
gave them what they needed.

32:33.651 --> 32:36.449
l guess they just didn't know
what to do with it.

32:36.521 --> 32:39.513
l want a complete report
on everything we've found,

32:39.590 --> 32:42.991
so l can share it
with our Kazon friends.

32:57.308 --> 33:00.072
We've recovered the console.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.044
lt's a replicator,

33:02.113 --> 33:06.049
constructed with materials
from Voyager.

33:06.117 --> 33:07.744
l suppose now everyone thinks

33:07.819 --> 33:10.379
l went over there
to destroy the evidence.

33:12.423 --> 33:13.720
Did you?

33:13.791 --> 33:18.922
l was only trying to show
everyone-- show you...

33:20.765 --> 33:25.395
You really think l had something
to do with this, don't you?

33:25.470 --> 33:29.770
To be honest,
l'm not sure anymore.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.309
l'm not sure of a lot of things.

33:32.377 --> 33:34.402
Then why don't you go talk
to your animal guide

33:34.479 --> 33:36.106
and figure it all out?

33:36.180 --> 33:37.613
l plan to.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.115
Good.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.481
Get back to me when you do.

33:43.554 --> 33:45.681
You know, it's funny...

33:45.757 --> 33:47.725
l've been thinking
about what's been real

33:47.792 --> 33:49.020
and what's not been real.

33:51.262 --> 33:53.321
What is this about?

33:53.398 --> 33:56.492
What's wrong with you?

33:56.567 --> 33:58.000
Talk to me, Chakotay.

33:58.069 --> 34:00.037
You owe me that much.

34:03.741 --> 34:05.208
What would you say

34:05.276 --> 34:08.074
l owed to a Cardassian
who infiltrated my crew?

34:08.146 --> 34:11.013
What are you talking about?

34:11.081 --> 34:12.606
lsn't that why you
never got around

34:12.683 --> 34:14.583
to a blood analysis
when we came on board?

34:14.652 --> 34:16.119
l didn't get around to it

34:16.187 --> 34:17.916
because l didn't
get around to it.

34:17.989 --> 34:19.047
Turns out your blood is missing

34:19.123 --> 34:20.385
all the common
Bajoran blood factors.

34:20.458 --> 34:23.824
lt's a side effect
of Orkett's disease.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.157
Ask your doctor.

34:25.228 --> 34:27.129
Orkett's disease?

34:27.197 --> 34:30.099
A childhood virus that swept
through the Bajoran work camps

34:30.168 --> 34:31.795
during the Occupation.

34:31.869 --> 34:33.893
Thousands of children
didn't survive.

34:33.971 --> 34:37.065
l did, thanks
to a bone marrow transplant

34:37.141 --> 34:39.609
from a sympathetic
Cardassian woman.

34:39.677 --> 34:41.143
Her name was Kattell.

34:41.212 --> 34:45.409
When we get home,
you can ask her yourself.

34:48.319 --> 34:52.380
You must think l'm horrible.

34:52.456 --> 34:55.551
Do you think l gave you my...

34:55.626 --> 34:59.995
my heart to get
your Maquis secrets?

35:00.031 --> 35:03.626
l was starting to wonder.

35:05.703 --> 35:08.831
Let me tell you something...

35:08.906 --> 35:12.342
your secrets
weren't good enough.

35:12.410 --> 35:14.742
They wouldn't have been worth
the trouble

35:14.812 --> 35:16.712
for a Cardassian agent.

35:16.781 --> 35:20.547
l had only one agenda
with you, Chakotay,

35:20.618 --> 35:23.052
and l never kept it secret.

35:26.424 --> 35:29.860
So, you believe in me again?

35:32.597 --> 35:34.428
l want to.

35:34.499 --> 35:38.230
Good, because l want
to go back to work.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.894
Let's not rush things.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.064
No, l'm going stir-crazy
in here.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.108
You're going to have
to stay confined,

35:44.175 --> 35:45.472
at least until we find out

35:45.543 --> 35:48.603
exactly where the replicator
components were taken from.

35:48.679 --> 35:50.943
Well, what'll that tell you?

35:51.015 --> 35:52.880
There might be evidence
of who took them.

35:52.950 --> 35:54.975
Oh, you don't think
whoever did this

35:55.052 --> 35:58.647
is foolish enough to log in
using their own name?

35:59.957 --> 36:02.949
Chief lnspector Tuvok
leaves no stone unturned.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.757
l'll tell the Captain
what you told me.

36:07.832 --> 36:10.824
Somehow, we'll try
to clear this up soon.

36:24.081 --> 36:27.380
She said a Cardassian
bone marrow transplant

36:27.451 --> 36:29.715
saved her life as a child.

36:29.787 --> 36:33.382
Did you set our plan in motion?

36:33.457 --> 36:36.722
l gave Lieutenant Carey
the same information.

36:36.794 --> 36:41.595
Now all we can do is wait
and hope someone takes the bait.

37:06.824 --> 37:09.122
Gin.

37:09.193 --> 37:13.129
l never knew Vulcans
had such a talent for cards.

37:13.197 --> 37:15.188
lt is simply a matter
of logical discards,

37:15.266 --> 37:17.860
which give a false impression
of my own requirements

37:17.969 --> 37:20.062
and deny the needed cards
to your hand.

37:20.137 --> 37:21.798
l believe that's
94 points to me.

37:21.872 --> 37:23.840
lf you ever need a sponsor
in a gin tournament,

37:23.908 --> 37:25.341
let me know.

37:25.409 --> 37:27.639
We're picking up
two more Kazon warships,

37:27.712 --> 37:29.009
about six hours away.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.843
We're not going to be able
to stay here much...

37:32.383 --> 37:35.181
That sounds like a nibble to me.

37:39.824 --> 37:41.849
Someone is accessing
the inventory database.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.086
And they're going straight

37:43.261 --> 37:44.193
to the missing
replicator materials.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.253
Should we start the trace now?

37:46.330 --> 37:47.388
Negative.
lt might alert them.

37:47.465 --> 37:48.489
They're entering data.

37:48.566 --> 37:50.033
lntriguing.
lt appears as though

37:50.101 --> 37:51.591
they're trying to place evidence

37:51.669 --> 37:54.502
at the scene of the crime
to indicate the guilty party.

37:54.572 --> 37:57.132
They're entering
an encrypted security code

37:57.208 --> 37:59.176
into the materials
requisition file.

37:59.243 --> 38:01.473
Which would suggest
they're hiding it,

38:01.579 --> 38:03.137
but not very well.

38:03.180 --> 38:06.809
Anybody know whose security code
that belongs to?

38:06.884 --> 38:08.977
l do.

38:09.053 --> 38:11.521
lt's Seska's.

38:13.691 --> 38:16.660
Then it has to be Carey.

38:16.727 --> 38:20.857
Carey is trying to point
the finger at Seska.

38:37.948 --> 38:40.883
Chakotay...

38:40.951 --> 38:43.215
is anything wrong?

38:43.287 --> 38:44.879
lt's over.

38:44.955 --> 38:48.083
We know who gave the technology
to the Kazon.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.629
Who?

38:52.697 --> 38:54.756
You did.

38:56.634 --> 39:00.092
Look, l don't know what evidence
you think you've found, but...

39:00.171 --> 39:01.638
We found the evidence

39:01.706 --> 39:03.731
you put there for us to find--

39:03.808 --> 39:05.673
your own security code.

39:05.743 --> 39:08.803
l have no idea
what you're talking about.

39:08.913 --> 39:12.246
We already knew where the stolen
materials had been taken from

39:12.316 --> 39:14.307
before l met with you.

39:14.385 --> 39:16.615
We were monitoring
the inventory manifest,

39:16.687 --> 39:19.850
hoping either you or Carey
would try to cover your tracks.

39:19.924 --> 39:22.222
Hell of a way for me
to cover my tracks--

39:22.293 --> 39:24.989
putting in my own security code
for you to find?

39:25.062 --> 39:26.529
That's exactly what you did.

39:26.597 --> 39:29.589
You knew no one would believe
you could be that careless.

39:29.667 --> 39:30.861
You wanted us to believe

39:30.968 --> 39:33.198
that someone else
was trying to frame you.

39:33.270 --> 39:35.738
Ever consider
that maybe someone was?

39:35.806 --> 39:39.264
We traced the computer station
used to enter the data.

39:39.343 --> 39:42.710
Oh, you took us all around
the system and back again

39:42.780 --> 39:45.078
before we could locate
the source,

39:45.149 --> 39:49.108
but it was this station
in Sick Bay.

39:52.256 --> 39:55.282
l'd almost say
it was a Maquis operation,

39:55.359 --> 39:58.556
if l didn't already know
you were a Cardassian.

39:58.629 --> 40:03.362
Computer, activate Emergency
Holographic Medical Program.

40:04.435 --> 40:06.062
Ah.

40:06.137 --> 40:10.073
Have l been called to testify?

40:10.141 --> 40:13.269
Before you even mentioned
Orkett's disease to me,

40:13.344 --> 40:16.142
the doctor had
already discounted that

40:16.213 --> 40:18.272
as a possible explanation
for your blood anomalies.

40:18.349 --> 40:19.543
And may l say

40:19.617 --> 40:21.312
a doctor less informed
about Bajoran medicine

40:21.385 --> 40:23.945
might have been fooled,
but my program includes

40:24.021 --> 40:26.922
the complete Bajoran medical
text on Orkett's disease.

40:26.991 --> 40:28.891
There's no way
any childhood virus

40:28.959 --> 40:30.984
or Cardassian
bone marrow transplant

40:31.061 --> 40:33.256
can explain away the genetic
markers in your blood.

40:33.330 --> 40:34.888
You are Cardassian, Ensign.

40:34.965 --> 40:37.661
But that didn't necessarily
make you the traitor

40:37.735 --> 40:39.669
we were looking for.

40:39.737 --> 40:43.798
We needed more evidence,
and you gave it to us.

40:43.874 --> 40:48.004
The one thing
l still can't understand is...

40:48.145 --> 40:49.669
why?

40:51.315 --> 40:54.045
l did it for you.

40:54.118 --> 40:58.054
l did it for this crew.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.987
We are alone here,

41:00.057 --> 41:02.992
at the mercy
of any number of hostile aliens

41:03.027 --> 41:05.791
because of
the incomprehensible decision

41:05.830 --> 41:08.390
of a Federation Captain.

41:08.466 --> 41:11.299
A Federation Captain
who destroyed

41:11.368 --> 41:13.563
our only chance to get home.

41:13.637 --> 41:16.401
Federation rules,

41:16.474 --> 41:19.068
Federation nobility,

41:19.143 --> 41:21.236
Federation compassion?

41:21.312 --> 41:22.609
Do you understand?

41:22.680 --> 41:26.116
lf this had been a Cardassian
ship, we would be home now.

41:26.183 --> 41:29.209
We must begin
to forge alliances.

41:29.286 --> 41:31.982
To survive,
we must have powerful friends.

41:32.056 --> 41:35.492
The Kazon-Nistrim were willing
to be our protectors

41:35.559 --> 41:37.925
in return
for some minor technology.

41:37.995 --> 41:40.156
Minor technology
that could change

41:40.231 --> 41:42.699
the balance of power
in this Quadrant.

41:42.766 --> 41:43.892
Change it in our favor.

41:43.968 --> 41:46.368
That is all that matters
at this point--

41:46.437 --> 41:49.065
building a base of power
in this Quadrant.

41:51.375 --> 41:54.833
You are a fool, Captain.

41:54.912 --> 41:57.642
And you're a fool to follow her.

41:57.715 --> 42:01.879
l can't imagine
how l ever loved you.

42:03.621 --> 42:04.918
Computer, Command XJL.

42:04.989 --> 42:08.390
Computer,
override transport in progress.

42:08.459 --> 42:11.451
Unable to comply.
Security lockout is in place.

42:11.529 --> 42:14.726
Computer, identify destination
of transport.

42:14.798 --> 42:18.131
A Kazon vessel,
14 kilometers off the port bow.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.226
Bridge to Janeway.

42:19.303 --> 42:20.770
-Go ahead.
-The Kazon ship

42:20.838 --> 42:21.862
is powering up its engines.

42:21.939 --> 42:23.668
lt looks like they're
getting ready to go to warp.

42:23.741 --> 42:25.038
Ready a tractor beam.

42:25.109 --> 42:26.736
l've also got two Kazon warships

42:26.810 --> 42:29.404
on an intercept course
less than ten minutes away.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.813
Captain, even with our superior
defense capabilities,

42:32.883 --> 42:36.148
we cannot prevail against
three Kazon warships.

42:36.220 --> 42:39.451
Awaiting your instructions,
Captain.

42:39.523 --> 42:41.650
Power down the tractor beam.

42:41.725 --> 42:44.888
Set a course out of here,
Mr. Paris, warp four.

42:44.962 --> 42:46.452
Engage when ready.

42:46.530 --> 42:47.997
Yes, ma'am.

42:48.098 --> 42:52.159
We'll have to wait for another
day to settle up with Seska.

43:08.419 --> 43:11.183
Can l ask you to be honest
with me, Lieutenant?

43:11.255 --> 43:14.122
As a Vulcan, l am at all
times honest, Commander.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.417
That's not exactly true.

43:17.494 --> 43:18.756
You lied to me

43:18.829 --> 43:20.922
when you passed yourself off
as a Maquis to get on my crew.

43:20.998 --> 43:22.556
l was honest
to my own convictions

43:22.633 --> 43:24.692
within the defined
parameters of my mission.

43:24.768 --> 43:27.931
You damned Vulcans
and your defined parameters.

43:28.005 --> 43:29.597
That's easy for you.

43:29.673 --> 43:32.141
On the contrary, the demands
on a Vulcan's character

43:32.209 --> 43:34.268
are extraordinarily difficult.

43:34.345 --> 43:38.475
Do not mistake composure
for ease.

43:38.549 --> 43:41.279
How may l be honest
with you today?

43:47.925 --> 43:49.756
l'd just like to know--

43:49.827 --> 43:54.662
from someone else who pulled
the wool over my eyes--

43:54.732 --> 43:57.166
was l particularly naive?

43:57.234 --> 43:58.667
Was l not paying
enough attention?

43:58.736 --> 44:01.034
What the hell was it that let
all you spies get by me?

44:01.138 --> 44:03.402
Like all humans,

44:03.440 --> 44:06.136
you depend on feelings
and instincts to guide you,

44:06.210 --> 44:09.043
and they invariably
let you down.

44:09.113 --> 44:10.045
But ''particularly naive''?

44:10.114 --> 44:13.208
No, Commander,
and l've always considered

44:13.283 --> 44:15.478
your attention span
to be adequate.

44:15.552 --> 44:17.679
Did you ever see anything
about Seska

44:17.755 --> 44:19.518
that made you suspicious?

44:19.590 --> 44:21.023
No.

44:21.091 --> 44:22.490
She quite expertly

44:22.559 --> 44:24.925
''pulled the wool'' over my eyes,
as well.

44:24.995 --> 44:26.587
Well...

44:26.664 --> 44:30.225
that makes me feel
a little better.

44:30.300 --> 44:31.562
Thanks.

44:31.635 --> 44:32.897
Curious.

44:32.970 --> 44:34.335
What?

44:34.405 --> 44:36.305
That my failure,
added to your own,

44:36.373 --> 44:38.034
should improve your feelings.

44:40.477 --> 44:43.105
Misery loves company, Tuvok.
