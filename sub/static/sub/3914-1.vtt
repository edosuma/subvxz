12:36.714 --> 12:38.705
Oh, you are shitting me.

12:40.677 --> 12:41.712
(CROWD CHEERING)

12:54.607 --> 12:56.689
Notbad.
Still dropping your right.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.072
Still fighting dirty.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.074
What are you going to do,
cry to Mom about it?

13:07.203 --> 13:09.535
You asshole.
Mom died three years ago.

13:13.918 --> 13:14.953
Mom died?

13:15.586 --> 13:17.747
I'm sorry,
I didn't know. How?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.290
She had Quinsy pretty bad
the last couple of years.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.462
Couldn't find you
to tell you.

13:20.550 --> 13:21.835
But that's exactly
what you wanted, huh?

13:21.926 --> 13:23.541
To cut ties with everyone?
Even me?

13:24.053 --> 13:25.088
Huh?

13:25.221 --> 13:26.210
VVhy?

13:30.977 --> 13:33.593
Where have you been, huh?
Where have you been?

13:40.737 --> 13:41.943
Leave it alone.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.152
Dutch.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.444
Fancy. Who's your collar?

13:51.080 --> 13:55.073
In the cage with your boy.
Level 5 warrant. You?

13:58.087 --> 13:59.918
Double booking
a kill warrant? Damn.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.588
Someone must really want
this poor bastard dead.

14:02.759 --> 14:06.343
Nah. Who does that?
Got to be a clerical
error, right?

14:06.429 --> 14:07.464
Could be.

14:07.597 --> 14:08.837
So, we should just
call this off,

14:09.640 --> 14:11.426
go straighten it out
with our brokers.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.600
And as soon as I leave,
you double back and
claim the kill yourself?

14:14.979 --> 14:16.765
(LAUGHS) I don't think so.

14:17.607 --> 14:21.316
You've got trust issues.
You should see someone
about that.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.773
I don't think we've ever gone
head to head, have we?

14:26.449 --> 14:27.484
Should be fun.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.870
LUCY: Com/ink reactivated.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.458
Thank the Trees.
John, you hear me?

14:36.542 --> 14:38.498
Out of the pit.
We got another agent
on your target.

14:38.628 --> 14:39.617
Play time's over.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.293

14:41.381 --> 14:43.622

14:43.716 --> 14:44.796
You stay down.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.379
(SCREAMS) You bite now?

14:48.137 --> 14:49.593
Why won't you let me help you?

14:49.680 --> 14:51.090
I am helping you.
This shit is rigged.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.297
They don't let
good fighters go,

14:52.392 --> 14:55.225
theyjust invent
more and more debts
until you can't get out.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.479
So, remember,
I'm doing this
for your own good.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.643
Doing what?

14:59.982 --> 15:02.018
DUTCH ON COMLINK:
Johnny, leave the mark.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.026

15:30.513 --> 15:32.003
Open the gate now.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.217
Hey. What did Ijust say?

15:34.725 --> 15:36.306
Projectiles are
physical contact,

15:36.394 --> 15:38.476
and physical contact
means he is mine.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.641
Or do you want to
explain to the RAC

15:40.731 --> 15:42.232
why you're obstructing
their warrant?

15:44.861 --> 15:45.896
On the gate.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.192
Give me a hand.
I hit him with a neuroblock.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.445
Can we at least tell him
that I knocked him out?

15:53.536 --> 15:54.571
Okay, okay.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.580
Hey, buddy, give me that.
She fixed the fight.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.721
DUTCH: Johnny,
what were you thinking?

16:16.184 --> 16:17.845
Look, I'll admit
I didn't think
everything through.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.516
But there was
a level 5 out on him.

16:19.604 --> 16:20.810
I had to claim it
before someone else did.

16:20.897 --> 16:21.932
By using my name?

16:22.064 --> 16:24.396
Well, I couldn't use mine.
I'm not licensed
for kill work, you are!

16:24.525 --> 16:27.267
What was your
endgame, exactly?
After you busted him out.

16:27.570 --> 16:28.935
(SIGHS)

16:29.071 --> 16:32.108
Fake his death, I guess.
Or say he got the drop on me
and escaped.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.448
That's not how
this shitworks, John.

16:34.619 --> 16:37.076
The RAC doesn'tjust
take your word on level 5s.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.907
There's inquests,
proof-of-death . ..

16:39.040 --> 16:41.577
Dutch. He's my brother.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.584
What was I supposed to do,
just stand by
and watch him die?

16:45.755 --> 16:46.995
You should have come to me.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.124
I was trying to
keep you out of it.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.758
How did that work out?

16:51.761 --> 16:53.968
Look, do you even know
what he did to earn
this warrant?

16:54.138 --> 16:56.254
No. But I know him.
He's good people.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.302
DUTCH: Then, why does someone
want him dead so bad?

16:59.977 --> 17:01.592
People can change
a lot in eight years, Johnny.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.353
He hasn't.

Someone want to tell me
where the hell I am?

17:17.119 --> 17:19.405
Are you familiar with
the Quad planetary system?

17:19.664 --> 17:21.655
Yeah, I've heard of it,
obviously. Never been here.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.906
DUTCH: Qresh and her
three moons are controlled

17:24.001 --> 17:25.832
by the mega-corp
called the Company.

17:26.921 --> 17:27.956
So, you living here now?

17:28.589 --> 17:30.625
We dock on Westerley,
but we work the whole Quad.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.835
What, as bounty hunters?

17:32.009 --> 17:33.340
Reclamation agents.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.586
We're independent
from the Company
that controls the Quad.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.421
So, why are you here?

17:40.309 --> 17:42.140
Vacation.
DUTCH: (SCOFFS) Really?

17:42.812 --> 17:45.144
On an indentured slaver ship.
Using an alias.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.979
Well, we can't all
travel first class.

17:47.483 --> 17:48.984
We're trying to
help you here, D'av.

17:49.277 --> 17:50.266
Don't need any.

17:50.361 --> 17:52.067
DUTCH: I've got a kill warrant
says otherwise.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.860
Kill warrants
are usually personal.

17:54.115 --> 17:56.151
Takes a lot of money
and power to make one stick.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.483
Who do you know
that hates you that much?

17:58.578 --> 18:00.318
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

18:00.413 --> 18:01.448
Noidea.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.904
Look, you don't want me here,
I don't want to be here.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.743
So, why don't you
just drop me off
at the next port

18:05.835 --> 18:06.995
and I'll be on my way?

18:10.131 --> 18:11.166
What?

18:11.257 --> 18:13.748
Once a kill warrant
is written, it's guaranteed.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.003
Meaning?

18:15.136 --> 18:17.752
If I don't terminate you
by the warrant's end,
they'll send another agent,

18:17.847 --> 18:19.132
and another, until it's done.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.006
Well. Shit.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.176
Take us to Leith.

You really have
nothing to say to me
after eight years?

18:40.036 --> 18:42.152
Could I really say
anything right
after eight years?

18:42.997 --> 18:44.362
So, let's just
figure this shit out

18:44.457 --> 18:46.322
and go our separate ways
again, okay?

18:47.793 --> 18:49.044
It's better for everyone.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.460
I missed you, too.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.040
(DOOR OPENS)

18:59.680 --> 19:01.716
So. Where is he now?

19:03.392 --> 19:05.007
On my boat. With Johnny.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.223
And Fancy Lee
saw you take him alive?

19:12.068 --> 19:13.729
You been sitting
on your brains, girl?

19:14.070 --> 19:15.059
Ow!

19:15.571 --> 19:19.063
Look, I've got 21 hours
before my warrant expires
and I'm in breach.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.025
Just tell me
how I can fix this.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.496
There's still time
to turn John in to
the RAC for his fraud.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.494
Clear your name.
What's the penalty?

19:29.585 --> 19:30.745
ForJohnny?

19:31.087 --> 19:33.669
Loss of license
and five years
hard labor, minimum.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.417
Okay, wow.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.923
No way. Other options?

19:38.260 --> 19:42.549
You can put your
big girl pants on
and finish the damn warrant.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.384
It's not like you haven't
killed on the job.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.685
Self-defense is different.

19:46.769 --> 19:47.758
Trust me.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.519
Anyway,
target's Johnny's brother.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.896

19:58.447 --> 20:00.438
I told you he was too soft
for this line of work.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.607
Yeah, well, I'm the one
who pulled him into it,
remember?

20:03.953 --> 20:06.069
I need to know
who put out
that warrant, Bell.

20:06.247 --> 20:07.282
VVhy?

20:07.373 --> 20:10.115
If I can figure out something
they want more
than D'avin's death,

20:10.251 --> 20:12.708
maybe I can get them
to null the warrant in trade.

20:13.879 --> 20:14.959
It's our only shot.

No, you're not.
Yes, I...

who my brother is
anymore, Dutch.

I can't be sure
he didn't earn
that kill warrant.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.272
Doesn't matter.
You have to protect him.
He's family.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.492

I don't care
if it's quarter-assed.
What's the plan?

Bellus says the warrant
was written by the Company.

21:37.338 --> 21:38.373
How is that good news?

21:38.464 --> 21:40.295
Because it's a
starting place.

Look, the Company goons
are in overdrive lately.

21:42.843 --> 21:47.212

are talking strikes again,
but I don't think so.

for someone.

more freely in the Quad

that asking you

23:55.017 --> 23:56.803
to help me find him
may be a non-starter.

23:57.353 --> 24:00.845
But I am asking.
If I knew how to beg,
I'd do that, too.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.689
What's your take
on the state of things
in the Quad these days?

24:08.322 --> 24:09.528
Westerlyns aren't happy.

24:09.657 --> 24:13.024
Westerlyns want war.

every day.

and the Company for good.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.160

24:20.793 --> 24:21.953
I want a revolution.

24:22.878 --> 24:23.867
We're not ready.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.462
If agitators like Rolly
step too soon,

24:27.549 --> 24:29.676
the Company will squash
us all. Again.

24:33.222 --> 24:36.385
I'll help you find him.
But this never leads
back to me or mine.

24:36.558 --> 24:37.638
You have my word.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.978
When you do choose a side
in this fight, Dutch,

24:40.062 --> 24:41.723
I hope it's Westerley.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.142
Killjoys can't take sides.

24:44.233 --> 24:47.475
We give up all citizenship
to join the RAC.
You know that.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.237
Yeah, I know you've both
seen too much

24:49.363 --> 24:50.819
for that to be possible
much longer.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.898
Thanks for your help.
Owe you one.

aren't you?

25:46.795 --> 25:49.457

25:51.216 --> 25:54.458
Sorry. How long
were you enlisted?

25:55.387 --> 25:56.422
Nine years.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.592
How long have you been
a professional killer?

25:58.891 --> 26:00.381
Nice. I'm not.

26:00.476 --> 26:01.716
Come on. Just 'cause
it's yourjob

26:01.810 --> 26:02.970
doesn't make them
any less dead.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.771
Look. Ijust came to say
that we have a plan.

26:08.650 --> 26:11.141
Sit tight. If all goes well,
we should be out
of this mess by morning.

26:11.236 --> 26:14.103
And if the plan goes bad?
What's the penalty for you?

26:14.656 --> 26:17.318
You asked Johnny if I'm worth
risking your asses for.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.574
I'm not.
Not arguing.

26:19.661 --> 26:20.821
Then, let me help.

26:21.497 --> 26:22.532
JOHN: We don't
need your help.

26:27.044 --> 26:28.159
John.

26:29.880 --> 26:33.213
Johnny. Johnny, come on.
I'm a decorated soldier.

26:33.342 --> 26:36.379
Oh, fancy. We got us
a war hero here.

26:37.679 --> 26:38.964
You know how to shoot
little people

26:39.056 --> 26:40.546
with big guns,
congratulations.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.553
Now what we do
takes a scooch more finesse.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.934
John. He's coming.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.057
You got me into this.
I'm saying how we get out.

26:48.357 --> 26:50.268
We don't have a warrant
protecting us this time,

26:50.359 --> 26:51.690
we may need the back up.

26:52.069 --> 26:54.481
Just tell me what to do.
I'll follow your lead,
I swear.

26:55.239 --> 26:57.025
When have you ever
followed my lead?

26:57.533 --> 26:58.568
You want him?

26:59.660 --> 27:00.695
You prep him.

to Qresh.

27:05.541 --> 27:06.872

27:11.505 --> 27:12.870
Don't make me regret this.

at a land blessing
this afternoon.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.265
We see him, we bag him,
and we’re out.

27:33.861 --> 27:34.896
Thank you.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.732
Blessing a damn garden.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.238
Man. Rich people are annoying
on every planet.

27:40.450 --> 27:43.738
JOHN: It’s not the garden,
it’s the new land underneath.
Blink for me?

27:44.705 --> 27:47.697
Half of Qresh is under water,
that's why they expanded
to their moons.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.874
Reclaiming every inch
of ancestral land here
is big business.

27:50.961 --> 27:52.747
D'AVIN: What’s so special
about ancestral land?

27:53.130 --> 27:54.540
You’ve got to own
some to be a citizen,

27:54.631 --> 27:56.838
and all Qreshi citizens
get shares in the Company.

27:56.925 --> 28:00.793
So, the bigger your property,
the bigger your piece.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.597
Like I said, rich people.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.178
This would be a lot easier
ifwe knew what our target
looked like.

28:07.269 --> 28:10.477
Relax. It’s pretty hard
to miss a rogue Scarback
monk in this crowd.

28:11.148 --> 28:12.638
Are you sure about that?

28:13.108 --> 28:14.143
Ah, hells.

28:14.276 --> 28:16.642
Dutch, we've got
half the church here.
You clocking this?

28:16.820 --> 28:19.812
Yep. Getting into position.

lD'd the target.

28:20.908 --> 28:22.114
(LAUGHS) Using what,
my psychic powers?

28:22.242 --> 28:23.778
Using the knowledge
that if you fail,

28:23.911 --> 28:26.118
everything that happens after
will be your fault.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.741
And point made. I am on it.

28:28.957 --> 28:29.946
Never doubted.

28:31.001 --> 28:33.492
Unless the target
is my partner's ass,

28:34.004 --> 28:35.335
do me a favor
and keep surveil/ing?

28:35.464 --> 28:37.329
You know, I remember you
being a lot more fun.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.331

and smelling better.

and scan those monks for me.

on my plate.

inside that ring.

from the Company,
I bet it's on that.

a lovely blessing.

Dutch is hit.

29:59.715 --> 30:01.000
Some kind of poison.
How bad?

30:01.091 --> 30:02.171
DUTCH: I’m fine.

30:03.885 --> 30:05.386
We need to
get you to a doctor.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.048
No time. John,
where's the kitchen?

30:07.264 --> 30:09.425

A hundred yards from
where you are.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.516
You and D'avin, find Rolly.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.264
Hey, forget Rolly,
I'm not leaving you like this.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.896
You asked me what
my people do if
I fail a kill warrant?

30:18.233 --> 30:19.222
This is what they do.

30:19.359 --> 30:21.816
They transfer the kill warrant
onto me until I make it right.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.644
Fancy won't miss me
next time.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.403

I got nothing to say to you.
I don't know you.
I don't trust you.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.626
Here's what I know.
You shot that guard,

and his friends are coming
through that door
to return the favor.

go out like this. Do you?

Couldn't risk a body shot.

No, you weren't.

to get out of here?

Why not?

by the Company

the hells out of it.

warrant canceled.

First kill warrant.
First failure.

37:51.686 --> 37:52.846
The warrant was
technically canceled.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.474
The warrant was technically
sabotaged by an agent
either too stupid

37:55.565 --> 37:57.226
or too arrogant
to know her place.

We offer one simple service
to all of our clients.

38:17.086 --> 38:19.077
We will cross contested
jurisdictions for you,

38:19.172 --> 38:20.412
find who or what
you're looking for,

38:20.507 --> 38:22.498
and bring it back to you
in the condition requested.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.002
Simple.

38:24.719 --> 38:25.754
Elegant.

38:26.221 --> 38:27.552
No one knows who hires us,

38:27.639 --> 38:30.255
but everyone knows they can
trust us to get the job done.

38:30.350 --> 38:33.888
And we can guarantee that
because our agents are guided
by one principle.

38:34.437 --> 38:36.644
One code.
What is that code?

38:36.940 --> 38:38.225
The warrant is all.
Again.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.476
The warrant is all.

38:39.901 --> 38:42.267
You broke your oath.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.193
Sign it.

38:50.578 --> 38:51.954
Cleared? Shouldn't I be...

38:52.038 --> 38:54.950
Expelled? Executed?
That was my vote.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.535
I was overruled.

38:57.418 --> 38:58.453
VVhy?

38:59.170 --> 39:00.580
I intend to find out.

39:02.215 --> 39:03.295
Sign it!

39:04.968 --> 39:06.003
(BEEPING)

39:17.939 --> 39:20.180
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(PEOPLE SINGING)

39:31.870 --> 39:34.452
Drink up, Iovelies. On me.

39:35.456 --> 39:37.833
Ah! He got papers?

39:38.126 --> 39:39.662
He's just passing through.

39:40.378 --> 39:44.792
Can't serve illegals.
But damn ifyou don't
look extra thirsty.

39:46.926 --> 39:48.041
Thanks, Pree.

39:48.678 --> 39:49.793
WOMAN: Hey.

39:53.016 --> 39:54.256
Excuse me, guys.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.103
You want to talk about it?

40:02.650 --> 40:04.311
What? My RAC debrief?

40:05.403 --> 40:08.145
No, aboutwhat happened
on the mission.
And don't say "nothing".

40:08.573 --> 40:12.316
Where did you disappear to?
Because we're sharing now.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.321
Okay. You first.

40:14.996 --> 40:16.702
What do you see
in those nightmares?

40:17.248 --> 40:19.455
And why does someone
here want you dead?

40:20.126 --> 40:22.367
Or I could just
shut up. Drink.

40:23.171 --> 40:24.206
Mmm-hmm.

40:31.346 --> 40:32.381
(WOMAN SINGING)

40:42.690 --> 40:44.305
How did you two meet,
anyway?

40:45.109 --> 40:46.189
Dutch?

40:48.237 --> 40:51.365
Uh, she caught me
stealing her ship
and offered me a job.

40:52.033 --> 40:54.319
Hell ofa ship.
How did she afford it?

40:55.536 --> 40:56.696
I didn't ask.

40:57.914 --> 40:58.994
Where's she from?

40:59.624 --> 41:00.704
Not around here.

41:01.542 --> 41:02.622
Where did she train?

41:04.379 --> 41:07.041
I don't know. Got a point
you want to make?

41:14.222 --> 41:15.758
D'AVIN: You’ve seen
her fight, Johnny.

41:15.848 --> 41:18.180
Someone obviously put
a lot of time and money
into training her.

41:18.267 --> 41:19.848
Don't you want to know
who or why?

41:19.978 --> 41:21.889
Nope. Don't care.
So, why do you?

41:22.897 --> 41:25.229
You're my little brother
and I don't trust
your partner.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.064
JOHN: Idon’t need you to.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.602
LUCY: Welcome back, Dutch.
You’ve had a visitor.

41:32.281 --> 41:35.614
Look, Johnny, I'm not
trying to be a jerk.
It's just a fact.

41:35.785 --> 41:38.276
A team like yours,
you can't have secrets
from each other.

41:38.371 --> 41:40.453
Your lives are in
each other’s hands.

41:40.748 --> 41:43.080
Her enemies
become your enemies.
So, I’m asking you,

41:43.918 --> 41:45.533
how well do you
really know her?

41:45.670 --> 41:47.285
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

41:49.465 --> 41:50.545
These days?

41:52.468 --> 41:54.004
Better than I know you.
