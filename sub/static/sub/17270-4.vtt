<i>There is a shadow war going
on between us and Ultra... </i>

00:19.046 --> 00:21.247
<i>- No!
-... the secret organization that hunts us.</i>

00:21.249 --> 00:23.749
<i>The only way to keep my
species from going extinct</i>

00:23.751 --> 00:25.451
<i>is to find my father.</i>

00:25.453 --> 00:27.820
<i>And the only way to do that
is by working for the enemy.</i>

00:27.822 --> 00:30.356
- I'm in.
- Welcome aboard, Stephen.

00:32.891 --> 00:35.093
<i>STEPHEN: Previously on
The Tomorrow People... </i>

00:35.095 --> 00:37.195
So you've decided to come home.

00:37.197 --> 00:38.730
Did you think he was gonna to
help you find your promised land?

00:38.732 --> 00:40.765
Why didn't you tell me
Jedikiah was my uncle?

00:40.767 --> 00:42.334
You are not like him. You're one of us.

00:42.336 --> 00:46.271
Wait, are you telling me my
lunatic, deadbeat dad was like you?

00:46.273 --> 00:48.072
I guess you could call him our leader.

00:48.074 --> 00:50.174
<i>(CHOKING) STEPHEN: Our
kind can't even kill.</i>

00:50.176 --> 00:53.611
Yet. But you are one mutation
away from acquiring that ability.

00:53.613 --> 00:54.645
That's insane.

Chill, guys, chill, there's
plenty more where that came from.

02:00.709 --> 02:02.209
Shh.

02:14.421 --> 02:16.274
I have to steal food,

02:17.039 --> 02:19.291
and you blow our foster money on booze?

02:19.427 --> 02:22.994
We need another lesson about
who owns this house, John?

02:28.133 --> 02:30.167
Now clean up that damn mess.

02:55.460 --> 02:58.461
Something going through
that thick skull of yours?

02:58.463 --> 03:00.663
Well, go ahead. Pick it up.

03:02.366 --> 03:07.403
(LAUGHING) Yeah. That's what I thought.

03:12.675 --> 03:14.242
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

03:20.082 --> 03:22.617
My name is Dr. Jedikiah Price.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.753
Would you mind putting down the knife?

03:27.623 --> 03:29.556
(KNIFE CLATTERS) Thank you.

03:29.558 --> 03:31.950
I'm looking for a foster
child who lives here.

03:31.951 --> 03:33.237
His name is John Young.

(BOTH GROANING)

03:40.202 --> 03:41.602
Damn it!

03:41.604 --> 03:43.236
You're getting better.

03:43.238 --> 03:44.271
(GROANING) Really?

03:44.329 --> 03:46.462
Nope.

03:46.464 --> 03:48.228
Oh, God, I'm trying...

03:48.229 --> 03:50.617
to forget the methods that
Ultra taught me, but...

03:51.368 --> 03:53.268
teleporting with someone is harder.

03:53.270 --> 03:56.071
It's all in your head. You're
letting yourself get daunted.

03:56.073 --> 03:58.039
And you're still thinking
about landing combat-ready.

03:58.041 --> 03:59.557
I don't really see the difference,

03:59.558 --> 04:01.664
as long as I land without busting my ass.

04:01.678 --> 04:03.732
Did Ultra training mention bending space,

04:03.733 --> 04:05.783
traveling between metaphysical planes?

04:05.785 --> 04:09.250
- Yeah, how'd you...
- You're talking to Jedikiah's former star pupil.

04:09.252 --> 04:11.218
Right.

04:11.220 --> 04:13.313
Your uncle wrote that handbook

04:13.314 --> 04:16.067
to boil our abilities
down to brute tactics,

04:16.125 --> 04:18.124
but teleporting isn't about intellect.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.326
It's about instinct, emotion.

04:20.327 --> 04:23.530
Feel your target, then allow
yourself to become a part of it.

04:23.532 --> 04:27.300
That handbook ignores everything
that makes our species special.

04:27.302 --> 04:30.637
(SIGHS) How about I be special tomorrow?

04:30.639 --> 04:31.772
I gotta get home for dinner.

04:37.629 --> 04:40.898
Three hours of teleport
training? You trying to kill him?

04:40.900 --> 04:42.533
You should have seen my training.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.811
- Think I should try?
- Yeah.

04:54.813 --> 04:56.779
Branch out?

04:56.781 --> 04:58.481
Sorry I'm late.

05:05.155 --> 05:10.726
I, um, tripped on a
sidewalk, and face-planted.

05:10.728 --> 05:12.461
Thank God no one saw.

05:12.463 --> 05:16.132
Stephen, if you joined some
sort of fight club, I want in.

05:16.134 --> 05:19.301
So, speaking of, um, how's Film Club?

05:19.303 --> 05:21.869
- Yeah, it's, uh...
- Think before you answer.

05:24.673 --> 05:26.908
I haven't been going.

05:26.910 --> 05:30.778
Your club sponsor called,
wondering if you had mono.

05:30.780 --> 05:34.315
And Astrid, where has she been?
I haven't seen her around in days.

05:35.851 --> 05:39.653
We had a bit of a falling
out. It'll be fine.

05:39.655 --> 05:43.190
So what exactly have you been
doing with yourself after school?

05:46.561 --> 05:48.654
I'm thinking before I answer.

05:49.997 --> 05:51.566
That has anything to do with it?

05:52.668 --> 05:56.036
What are you doing with an employee
badge from your uncle's company?

05:57.571 --> 05:59.805
I've been interning for him.

05:59.807 --> 06:02.741
I know you associate
Jedikiah with Dad leaving.

06:02.743 --> 06:04.410
(SCOFFING) It's more complicated than that.

06:04.457 --> 06:06.390
That's not good enough for me.

06:06.392 --> 06:08.159
Well, I don't trust him, Stephen.

06:08.161 --> 06:11.661
It's not like I'm going on
camping trips with the guy.

06:11.663 --> 06:14.464
But if he can tell me more
about what happened with Dad,

06:14.466 --> 06:16.699
I need him right now.

06:16.701 --> 06:18.568
Why, is he talking to
you about your father?

06:20.438 --> 06:21.605
We're working up to that.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.974
But in the meantime, I promise

06:25.976 --> 06:27.776
there is nothing dangerous
about me spending time with him.

06:30.213 --> 06:32.515
Fine.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.550
Why don't you invite him to dinner?

06:34.552 --> 06:38.354
That way he can tell me what
kind of work he has you doing.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.855
- Uh...
- He is family, after all.

06:44.793 --> 06:47.928
<i>The explosion and smoke that rocked
downtown Chicago this afternoon</i>

06:47.930 --> 06:50.731
<i>was initially attributed
to a ruptured gas main.</i>

06:50.733 --> 06:53.200
<i>- However, a full investigation...
- Next.</i>

06:53.202 --> 06:55.770
<i>The blast, which released plumes of smoke,</i>

06:55.772 --> 06:57.638
<i>- so weakened the foundations of...
- That's enough.</i>

07:00.475 --> 07:02.743
Something you wanna share?

07:02.745 --> 07:05.097
I figured there was no reason to worry you

07:05.098 --> 07:06.142
if it turns out to be nothing.

07:06.514 --> 07:08.148
It doesn't look like that's the case.

07:09.183 --> 07:11.217
Tim, line 'em up.

07:12.887 --> 07:16.690
Four explosions moving east.
Next big city in line...

07:18.125 --> 07:19.159
Is us.

07:20.194 --> 07:22.427
Wait. You think it's McCrane?

07:22.479 --> 07:23.879
Sure looks like it.

07:23.881 --> 07:25.280
Why now? Why would he come back?

07:25.282 --> 07:26.281
I don't know.

07:34.257 --> 07:37.626
I'm compiling the latest
intel on Killian McCrane,

07:37.628 --> 07:41.428
although the most recent
update is almost two years ago.

07:41.430 --> 07:43.765
Add these latest four
incidents to the McCrane file.

07:46.268 --> 07:47.534
Just a hunch.

07:48.837 --> 07:50.571
Thank you.

07:53.375 --> 07:55.375
- Uncle Jed, do you have a second?
- No.

07:55.377 --> 07:57.477
What'd I tell you to call me here?

07:57.479 --> 08:00.647
(SIGHING) I need to ask a favor, sir.

08:01.949 --> 08:05.351
Dinner? It's not gonna happen.

08:05.353 --> 08:07.654
I don't have time to handhold
your mother at the moment.

08:07.656 --> 08:10.389
Handle it, Stephen. While you're at it,

08:10.391 --> 08:13.458
familiarize yourself with Killian McCrane.

08:13.460 --> 08:17.797
He's a suspect in 15 bombings,
responsible for 10 fatalities.

08:17.799 --> 08:21.300
I thought my kind couldn't kill,
that we weren't wired that way,

08:21.302 --> 08:23.302
the whole ringing in my ears.

08:23.304 --> 08:25.837
Yeah, well, Killian is unique.

08:26.909 --> 08:29.908
A corrupted form of your species.
Also a former Ultra agent.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.676
He was with Ultra?

08:31.678 --> 08:33.912
Till he went on his first rampage.

08:33.914 --> 08:37.285
Exactly how many killing
sprees has he been on?

08:37.287 --> 08:38.087
Why hasn't he been caught?

08:38.094 --> 08:40.761
I know you're not trying to
upset me, Stephen, but you are.

08:40.854 --> 08:44.136
Read the file. And deal with your mother.

- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addiced.com -

09:19.214 --> 09:21.248
- JOHN: It's gotta be him.
- CARA: After all this time.

09:21.250 --> 09:23.283
McCrane decided to come back for Jedikiah?

09:23.285 --> 09:26.285
Well, he certainly has grounds for
wanting to see the man incinerated.

09:29.223 --> 09:31.724
Couldn't have waited another two seconds?

09:31.726 --> 09:34.727
This is a much easier fight
without Jedikiah alive.

09:34.729 --> 09:36.195
I'm supposed to let him die?

09:36.197 --> 09:38.297
Killing's not in my DNA, John.

09:38.299 --> 09:40.933
It's in Jedikiah's. Flip the
roles, he'd have let you burn.

09:44.270 --> 09:46.638
Ultra is in full lock-down.

09:46.640 --> 09:50.242
The name Killian McCrane is going around.

09:50.244 --> 09:52.910
Some former agent who
turned himself into a killer.

09:52.912 --> 09:56.348
"Turned himself"? That's
what Jedikiah said?

09:56.350 --> 09:58.749
McCrane was part of the Annex Project.

09:58.751 --> 10:01.619
An experiment to weaponize Ultra agents.

10:01.621 --> 10:03.387
It was catastrophic.

10:03.389 --> 10:07.724
Jedikiah used brutal drug therapies
to fry out the part of the brain

10:07.726 --> 10:10.727
that blocks us from killing.
The so-called "prime barrier."

10:10.729 --> 10:12.796
The result was countless dead agents.

10:12.798 --> 10:14.764
Only McCrane survived, but it cooked him.

10:14.766 --> 10:18.334
It's Jedikiah's fault that McCrane's
out in the world killing humans.

10:18.336 --> 10:20.836
The one thing your
uncle's sworn to protect.

10:20.838 --> 10:23.640
Then he'll be all the more
grateful when I bring him in.

10:23.642 --> 10:25.875
- You're kidding, right?
- McCrane's a maniac.

10:25.877 --> 10:27.877
Putting him away is
what's best for everyone.

10:27.879 --> 10:30.646
And if I'm the one to do it, maybe
I can get my uncle off my back

10:30.648 --> 10:32.181
and get a higher clearance.

10:32.183 --> 10:34.716
Do you have any idea how
many agents he tore through

10:34.718 --> 10:36.751
when I was at Ultra and we went after him?

10:36.753 --> 10:38.978
We can't risk what few bodies we've got

10:38.979 --> 10:41.250
for the sake of your promotion.

10:41.258 --> 10:43.158
Well, how about because he's a killer?

10:43.160 --> 10:45.026
I don't work for Ultra anymore.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.233
Stephen.

10:52.235 --> 10:58.239
John's time working for
your uncle was complicated.

10:58.241 --> 10:59.740
A lot happened to him.

11:01.076 --> 11:02.909
Things he doesn't even talk to me about.

11:02.911 --> 11:04.977
I get that.

11:04.979 --> 11:09.048
But Killian McCrane needs to
be stopped with or without you.

11:17.925 --> 11:21.760
John's aptitude testing blew away
the other children at his school.

11:21.762 --> 11:23.995
Literally off the charts.

11:23.997 --> 11:27.299
- That's when we were alerted.
- I think you got the wrong kid.

11:27.301 --> 11:28.334
This one's an idiot.

11:30.970 --> 11:33.324
Yes, well the testing
often recognizes gifts

11:33.325 --> 11:35.144
that go unnoticed by other people.

11:35.775 --> 11:37.808
<i>(THINKING) That was you in
the stolen car, wasn't it?</i>

11:39.077 --> 11:42.680
<i>It's okay. I know you can read my mind.</i>

11:42.682 --> 11:45.383
<i>I can't do what you can do,
so just nod if you can hear me.</i>

11:49.154 --> 11:52.021
We're gonna help him develop those gifts.

11:52.023 --> 11:55.225
I understand you're compensated
for taking care of these children?

11:57.161 --> 12:00.697
I think this will more
than take care of your loss.

12:00.699 --> 12:06.035
Plus a little extra for any
emotional loss you may feel.

12:06.037 --> 12:07.811
We're going to need to take him right away,

12:07.812 --> 12:09.470
of course, unless you have any objection.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.307
Whatever's best for the boy.

12:19.816 --> 12:21.751
(GRUNTING)

12:23.686 --> 12:25.086
Heavy bag just threw in the towel.

12:26.289 --> 12:28.022
You wanna talk about it?

12:28.024 --> 12:29.857
What's there to talk about?

12:29.859 --> 12:32.627
McCrane.

12:32.629 --> 12:35.930
- He was your friend.
- That's before they made him a killer.

12:35.932 --> 12:37.666
He's Ultra's problem now.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.958
Just got a hit from a PD camera.

12:46.959 --> 12:47.959
A facial match on McCrane.

12:48.243 --> 12:50.711
He walked into a warehouse
downtown three minutes ago.

12:50.713 --> 12:52.045
Good. Bring him in.

12:54.081 --> 12:55.381
No.

12:55.383 --> 12:58.150
I wanna do my part to help catch this guy!

12:58.152 --> 13:00.753
Why'd you have me studying his file
if I was just gonna be sidelined?

13:00.755 --> 13:02.922
You can monitor from your desk.

13:02.924 --> 13:05.358
Sir, you gave me a chance
here, and I need to prove

13:05.360 --> 13:07.026
it wasn't just because we're related.

13:07.028 --> 13:09.929
And with all due respect,
I saved your life.

13:12.164 --> 13:13.332
Sir.

13:15.635 --> 13:16.768
Not a hair off his head.

13:34.285 --> 13:36.787
Stay in line, stay silent. Got it?

13:38.657 --> 13:40.624
What the hell is that?

13:40.626 --> 13:41.788
It's a stun gun.

13:41.789 --> 13:43.690
I can't kill McCrane like
our human counterparts,

13:43.695 --> 13:45.928
but I am not going in there empty-handed.

13:45.930 --> 13:47.964
(WHISPERING) Good idea. What about me?

13:47.966 --> 13:50.132
You stay in line, you stay silent.

13:50.134 --> 13:51.333
All right. Let's go.

13:58.708 --> 13:59.941
DARCY: Let's go!

14:09.118 --> 14:10.252
- What is it?
- McCrane.

14:12.688 --> 14:13.989
Stephen, wait!

14:13.991 --> 14:15.723
I'm not letting him get away.

14:23.865 --> 14:26.200
You're not John.

14:26.202 --> 14:27.667
What do you want with John?

14:27.669 --> 14:28.903
We have unfinished business.

14:30.838 --> 14:32.172
A shame he's not here.

14:36.744 --> 14:38.645
(GRUNTING)

14:38.647 --> 14:40.013
Hubris, boy.

14:40.015 --> 14:41.580
(PAINED GRUNTING)

14:44.785 --> 14:45.919
Oh!

14:49.990 --> 14:53.592
(PANTING)

14:55.995 --> 14:59.097
- You saved...
- My own ass. Not yours.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.376
No concussion, no broken bones.

15:12.378 --> 15:14.945
Well, you're lucky, Stephen.
You don't know how lucky.

15:16.180 --> 15:18.014
I'm starting to get an idea.

15:18.016 --> 15:18.948
Oh, you're starting?

15:20.250 --> 15:22.084
Come here, son.

15:22.086 --> 15:26.189
Look, I can appreciate you
wanting to prove yourself,

15:26.191 --> 15:30.527
but the real world is filled with
dark, warped, cunning individuals.

15:30.529 --> 15:34.496
And what brings them down is not
puppy-dog eagerness, but tactics.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.199
Training. Experience.

15:36.201 --> 15:38.367
You're right. I'll be more careful.

15:39.970 --> 15:41.841
This dinner with your mom.

15:42.418 --> 15:44.283
You think maybe she can do tonight?

15:44.475 --> 15:46.275
I'll ask.

15:46.277 --> 15:50.611
Maybe drop the hint to steer
clear of brussels sprouts?

15:50.613 --> 15:52.413
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

15:52.415 --> 15:55.116
All right, give me the word. Beat it, kid.

15:58.087 --> 16:02.557
Dig up all the surveillance for this
facility up to and after the explosion.

16:02.559 --> 16:04.391
What's your thinking, sir?

16:04.393 --> 16:07.228
That if McCrane wanted me
dead I wouldn't be here.

16:07.230 --> 16:09.629
I'm starting to doubt that I'm his target.

16:09.631 --> 16:10.931
I'm on it, sir.

16:14.402 --> 16:15.842
I'm gonna take a wild leap

16:15.843 --> 16:17.584
and say you didn't just hunt McCrane.

16:19.474 --> 16:22.408
They came up together. At Ultra.

16:22.410 --> 16:23.937
I always felt sorry for him.

16:23.938 --> 16:26.191
He was the one kid with
a story worse than mine.

16:26.647 --> 16:28.514
Beatings, abuse...

16:28.516 --> 16:31.717
After the Annex debacle,
McCrane fled the program.

16:31.719 --> 16:33.987
Ultra wanted him swept under the rug.

16:33.989 --> 16:37.322
Since I knew him, Jedikiah
had tasked me to bring him in.

16:37.324 --> 16:39.124
He thinks you betrayed him.

16:39.126 --> 16:41.493
And he won't stop killing
unless we stop him.

16:41.495 --> 16:43.962
- We?
- Or he'll just slink back into hiding.

16:43.964 --> 16:45.530
He almost got Stephen.

16:45.532 --> 16:48.267
If you're not gonna do
something about McCrane, I will.

16:48.269 --> 16:52.003
Jedikiah thinks your
powers were erased by him.

16:52.005 --> 16:53.871
That little stunt that saved you?

16:53.873 --> 16:55.101
If he gets wind of the truth,

16:55.102 --> 16:56.981
our new friend here gets
a needle in the neck.

16:59.577 --> 17:01.145
Where did you say that warehouse was?

17:01.146 --> 17:02.146
Downtown, why?

17:05.349 --> 17:07.684
Can't have been a coincidence
McCrane led you there.

17:11.821 --> 17:15.791
DARCY: The explosion happens here.

17:15.794 --> 17:22.464
Jenkins reacts. He leaves his post,

17:22.467 --> 17:24.465
and there's McCrane.

17:24.468 --> 17:28.037
He searched for one
file, sir. John Young's.

17:37.949 --> 17:39.548
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

17:53.229 --> 17:54.663
Keep your guard up.

17:54.665 --> 17:56.497
All right, all right, all right, time.

17:56.499 --> 17:59.533
(SIGHING) Come here, kid.

17:59.535 --> 18:02.337
He's twice my size! I don't
have enough guard to go around.

18:02.339 --> 18:03.771
Yeah. Well, you see, Killian's learned

18:03.773 --> 18:06.975
to turn his fear and
aggression into a weapon.

18:06.977 --> 18:09.410
You figured out how to
use your powers to survive,

18:09.412 --> 18:12.149
but the real world is filled with dark,

18:12.150 --> 18:14.852
warped, cunning individuals, son.

18:17.652 --> 18:19.520
Look. You are our youngest recruit ever

18:19.522 --> 18:22.255
and I have no doubt that you
are destined for great things.

18:24.025 --> 18:27.127
But tap into that anger and
aggression. Don't be afraid of it.

18:27.129 --> 18:30.029
It's a law of nature. Kill or be killed.

18:36.336 --> 18:39.038
JOHN: You don't have to be here, you know.

18:39.040 --> 18:42.074
If I find Killian I promise
to knock him over the head,

18:42.076 --> 18:44.743
so you can turn him in
to Ultra the big hero.

18:44.745 --> 18:48.413
(CHUCKLES) Well, your old
pal got in a shot at me.

18:48.415 --> 18:50.148
I'd like to return the favor.

18:52.385 --> 18:54.553
You know, you never talk
about your time at Ultra.

18:55.622 --> 18:58.423
I can't really imagine you there.

18:58.425 --> 19:01.425
Well, Jedikiah took me
in from less than nothing.

19:01.427 --> 19:04.294
He gave me plenty to eat, a
roof. That was all new to me.

19:06.164 --> 19:09.366
Then it went from being
SuperKids Summer Camp

19:09.368 --> 19:11.969
to people dying.

19:11.971 --> 19:16.072
Breakouts getting their powers
extracted, experimented on,

19:16.074 --> 19:18.474
shot in the head.

19:18.476 --> 19:20.276
The opposite of what your father wanted.

19:22.013 --> 19:23.547
A place our kind would be safe.

19:28.019 --> 19:31.387
I know that you think
that I hang back sometimes.

19:32.622 --> 19:34.990
I'm only trying to
fulfill your dad's vision

19:34.992 --> 19:36.559
the way I think he would have.

19:40.530 --> 19:42.631
You hear music?

19:42.633 --> 19:44.266
It's coming from over here.

19:45.301 --> 19:48.135
(PEOPLE CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY)

19:48.137 --> 19:50.672
JOHN: We're right over the
youth orchestra auditorium.

19:52.575 --> 19:54.909
You don't actually think that Killian would

19:54.911 --> 19:56.678
blow up a room full of kids, do you?

19:58.547 --> 19:59.981
I do.

20:06.678 --> 20:09.312
This concert hall is
adjacent to the warehouse.

20:16.787 --> 20:18.488
McCrane wasn't just hiding here.

20:22.459 --> 20:24.126
He was casing his next target.

20:29.131 --> 20:30.399
KILLIAN: Johnny boy!

20:31.668 --> 20:33.202
Long time.

20:33.204 --> 20:34.303
Watch your back, Stephen.

20:42.144 --> 20:44.278
Killian. Leave him alone.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.414
You're looking for me, what do you want?

20:46.416 --> 20:49.584
That is no way to start a reunion.

20:49.586 --> 20:51.522
Maybe I just wanted to see you.

20:51.528 --> 20:53.752
Catch up, ask a few questions.

20:53.824 --> 20:55.690
Like why'd you leave Ultra?

20:55.692 --> 20:58.792
What did he do, John, to
finally push you over the edge?

20:58.794 --> 21:00.694
Will you turn yourself in if I tell you?

21:00.696 --> 21:02.303
You were his golden boy.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.937
Must've been pretty bad
if you couldn't stomach it.

21:07.335 --> 21:08.981
I'm back for you, John.

21:08.982 --> 21:11.202
When I discovered you
were no longer hunting me,

21:11.207 --> 21:14.074
I needed to know why.
So I stole your files.

21:14.076 --> 21:16.776
Imagine my surprise when I
discovered that you left the company.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.412
You're a fugitive now, just like me.

21:20.414 --> 21:23.082
- The hell I am.
- That makes you a man without a country!

21:24.484 --> 21:26.518
Join me, John.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.520
Come on, it'll be just like old times.

21:28.522 --> 21:30.322
The two of us working together.

21:30.324 --> 21:32.257
- For what?
- Revenge.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.627
Jedikiah for starters.

21:35.629 --> 21:38.363
For the horrors he's inflicted. We
can burn that place to the ground.

21:38.365 --> 21:40.361
Jedikiah might be a monster,

21:40.362 --> 21:42.219
but you're no better than he is.

21:43.303 --> 21:46.404
Well, then I guess I'll just
have to apologize ahead of time.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.507
That what you were looking for?

21:56.614 --> 21:57.815
Stephen, we have a problem.

22:14.691 --> 22:15.958
What are you doing?

22:18.762 --> 22:20.896
Twenty seconds!

22:20.898 --> 22:23.431
The bombs are in a circuit. They
need to be disarmed all at once.

22:23.433 --> 22:25.233
Cut the black wire right in the middle

22:25.235 --> 22:26.968
at the exact moment I cut the other five.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.870
A fraction of a second early or late

22:28.872 --> 22:30.605
and we're looking about
a tenth of a megaton.

22:33.309 --> 22:35.677
You've done this before,
been in five places at once?

22:35.679 --> 22:38.712
It's been a while. Need to build
up to it, gauge the distances.

22:38.714 --> 22:39.846
Listen for my signal.

22:42.450 --> 22:43.817
John.

22:47.789 --> 22:48.756
John!

22:54.861 --> 22:55.828
JOHN: Now!

22:58.999 --> 22:59.965
(GROANS)

23:15.548 --> 23:18.450
Why would Killian set up a
place to explode like that?

23:18.452 --> 23:20.452
Six bombs all at once.

23:20.454 --> 23:23.355
He was testing me. See if
I'm still a worthy adversary.

23:23.357 --> 23:28.892
If he finds me, our
lair, he'd expose us all.

23:28.894 --> 23:30.594
We gotta outsmart him.

23:30.596 --> 23:33.564
<i>TIM: Stephen. Some information
that might be of interest.</i>

23:33.566 --> 23:35.666
<i>You've missed three phone
calls from your mother.</i>

23:35.668 --> 23:37.635
<i>It seems you may be late for dinner.</i>

23:37.637 --> 23:39.303
(SIGHING) Jedikiah's at my house.

23:40.405 --> 23:42.339
Family dinner, long story.

23:51.048 --> 23:53.750
Look, John, I know I pushed
you to go after McCrane...

23:53.752 --> 23:56.486
No. You were right.

23:56.488 --> 23:58.554
No one's safe until we take him down.

24:00.423 --> 24:01.590
Not even us.

24:13.569 --> 24:16.804
You stupid twit. Already
get yourself kicked out?

24:16.806 --> 24:18.539
I'm not giving that money back.

24:18.541 --> 24:22.009
I didn't wanna be there anymore.
I just wanted to come home.

24:22.011 --> 24:24.545
Wherever you ran from,
you're going back there.

24:24.547 --> 24:25.980
Get off me!

24:25.982 --> 24:27.415
The hell?

24:29.617 --> 24:30.984
(GROANS)

24:41.028 --> 24:42.763
(GROANING)

24:49.035 --> 24:50.002
(GRUNTS)

25:02.981 --> 25:05.283
You just learned a very
important lesson, kid.

25:05.285 --> 25:08.252
Never expose your powers to anyone.

25:08.254 --> 25:11.589
I'm the only human being who is
going to accept you for who you are.

25:11.591 --> 25:12.624
Okay?

25:17.396 --> 25:18.395
He's dead.

25:19.831 --> 25:23.734
He got drunk... played with his
pistol. Accidental discharge.

25:28.773 --> 25:30.407
It's okay.

25:30.409 --> 25:32.676
The kids are going to be
placed with better families now.

25:32.678 --> 25:35.377
It's like I said, kill or be killed, son.

25:41.852 --> 25:44.954
Very good, Marla. That was some pork chop.

25:44.956 --> 25:46.656
Thank you, Jedikiah.

25:46.658 --> 25:50.258
What kind of name is Jedikiah?

25:50.260 --> 25:52.764
(STAMMERS) I'm just asking.
I mean, are we, like,

25:53.365 --> 25:54.792
part Amish or something?

25:54.799 --> 25:56.664
- Well...
- Honey, don't you have a math test tomorrow?

25:56.666 --> 25:58.933
- You're excused to go study.
- (SIGHS) Whatever.

26:00.902 --> 26:02.437
I miss everything.

26:02.439 --> 26:04.105
(DISHES CLATTERING)

26:04.107 --> 26:06.374
So I'm getting the feeling you're a
little bit concerned about Stephen.

26:08.543 --> 26:10.411
What's he doing for you exactly?

26:10.413 --> 26:12.012
Mom, I already told you...

26:12.014 --> 26:14.948
I just thought your uncle might
give me some clarity on the position.

26:14.950 --> 26:17.484
Well, yeah, he's, um...

26:17.486 --> 26:19.453
filing, fetching coffee...

26:19.455 --> 26:21.654
He comes home with bruises, Jed.

26:21.656 --> 26:25.492
Marla, we're a bio-medical
research facility.

26:25.494 --> 26:27.527
He's there for a few hours at a time

26:27.529 --> 26:29.661
and a normal teenager, I
guess, the rest of the day.

26:29.663 --> 26:32.398
Why don't we do pie in the living room?

26:32.400 --> 26:34.266
This is what I know.

26:34.328 --> 26:38.097
Before Roger went to work
with you at Ultra, he was fine.

26:38.099 --> 26:41.900
He was a kind, loving husband
who adored his children.

26:41.902 --> 26:43.436
And you.

26:43.438 --> 26:45.403
Whatever you were doing over there,

26:45.405 --> 26:47.638
your studies or genetic experiments...

26:47.640 --> 26:49.740
It's hardly Frankenstein's laboratory.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.409
It changed him.

26:51.411 --> 26:53.545
He became distant and paranoid,

26:53.547 --> 26:56.481
made us up-end our lives and move.

26:56.483 --> 26:59.617
And no one has ever
been able to tell me why.

27:00.718 --> 27:03.053
So tell me, what happened to Roger?

27:03.055 --> 27:06.290
I just think this is a
question for your husband.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.459
Your brother.

27:08.461 --> 27:09.893
Wherever he may be.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.966
My gut tells me to cut you off.

27:18.935 --> 27:20.836
But you're Stephen's family.

27:20.838 --> 27:23.406
And a connection to his father.

27:23.408 --> 27:26.576
So I'm going to allow this internship.

27:26.578 --> 27:28.010
But know this Jed...

27:29.679 --> 27:30.913
I'm watching you.

27:32.881 --> 27:34.416
Noted.

27:34.418 --> 27:36.384
And appreciated.

27:36.386 --> 27:37.619
- I think...
- Who wants some pie?

27:44.427 --> 27:49.363
- Uh, sir...
- Uncle Jed. We're not at the office.

27:49.365 --> 27:51.098
I had no idea that was going to happen.

27:51.100 --> 27:53.567
It's okay, kid. Everyone takes their lumps.

27:53.569 --> 27:56.036
Look... I have a task for you.

27:56.038 --> 27:58.672
John Young. Is there any way
you can get him a message?

28:00.575 --> 28:02.893
You, uh, brought in his girlfriend,

28:02.894 --> 28:04.513
you were the last person to see his people.

28:05.479 --> 28:07.213
I can try.

28:07.215 --> 28:09.482
Wherever he is, it seems
like he's dug in pretty deep.

28:09.484 --> 28:11.083
Hmm.

28:11.085 --> 28:13.486
I don't think Ultra can
take out McCrane alone.

28:15.989 --> 28:18.558
I need you to arrange a
meeting between John and I.

28:19.893 --> 28:21.860
I'll see what I can do.

28:21.862 --> 28:24.496
No! No way. It's a trap.

28:24.498 --> 28:26.731
<i>TIM: What you just said could
be interpreted in the negative.</i>

28:26.733 --> 28:29.568
<i>Meaning there's no
possibility of it being a trap.</i>

28:29.570 --> 28:31.603
I meant, no way it isn't a trap,

28:31.605 --> 28:33.338
you literal-minded hunk of crap.

28:33.340 --> 28:34.739
Where does he wants this meeting?

28:34.741 --> 28:36.474
You're not actually considering going?

28:36.476 --> 28:39.644
Your call. I'll teleport
him in alone, blindfolded.

28:39.646 --> 28:41.812
We don't work with these butchers.

28:41.814 --> 28:44.848
Seriously, how did I become
the voice of reason around here?

28:44.850 --> 28:46.584
Noodle shop, 5:00.

28:47.952 --> 28:49.453
Ah, don't move.

28:49.455 --> 28:52.522
First thing, we are mapping
out logistics and security.

28:53.891 --> 28:55.392
What's this about?

28:55.394 --> 28:57.460
I'm out of ideas on how to find McCrane.

28:57.462 --> 29:00.730
As much as Jedikiah wants
McCrane, he wants you more.

29:00.732 --> 29:02.666
I don't get it, he took a shot at you,

29:02.668 --> 29:05.835
he tried to kill me, and you
still jump to when he calls?

29:05.837 --> 29:06.969
What are you not telling me?

29:06.971 --> 29:08.537
What is his hold over you?

29:09.539 --> 29:11.207
I've seen the worst he's done.

29:11.209 --> 29:13.642
I've been an agent of it.

29:13.644 --> 29:16.478
But he's the closest thing
I've ever had to a father.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.547
I don't expect you to understand.

29:18.549 --> 29:20.416
How can I when you won't explain?

29:20.418 --> 29:22.585
I'm sorry Cara, I'm going. Alone.

29:34.575 --> 29:36.175
Okay, we're here.

29:37.511 --> 29:39.478
This is where John wanted to meet?

29:40.447 --> 29:41.981
Charming.

29:41.983 --> 29:43.316
You two wanted privacy.

29:44.385 --> 29:45.483
Hmm.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.192
Hello, John.

29:56.396 --> 29:59.364
- You're looking well.
- What do you want?

29:59.366 --> 30:01.233
Well, in case you haven't figured it out,

30:01.235 --> 30:03.000
your friend Killian is back.

30:03.002 --> 30:04.702
- I know.
- And he's after you.

30:04.704 --> 30:06.538
I know that also. What do you want?

30:08.140 --> 30:10.374
Well, I would like to avoid

30:10.376 --> 30:11.689
sacrificing the 20 or so agents

30:11.690 --> 30:13.114
it would take to get him without you.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.747
From where I sit, that's a win.

30:15.749 --> 30:16.647
Look, McCrane is after you.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.670
Why can't we use that
to our mutual advantage?

30:18.684 --> 30:20.451
McCrane can't get me.

30:20.453 --> 30:22.385
But he's being reckless.

30:22.387 --> 30:24.154
How long before he's
caught using his powers

30:24.156 --> 30:26.657
and blows the lid off your kind?

30:26.659 --> 30:28.692
That's both of our problems.

30:28.694 --> 30:32.295
So what do you say, you and me...

30:32.297 --> 30:34.163
call a cease fire?

30:34.165 --> 30:36.098
Temporarily, of course.

30:37.701 --> 30:40.703
The extent of us working together

30:40.705 --> 30:43.092
will be you providing
me with Ultra resources

30:43.093 --> 30:44.124
so I can track him down.

30:45.309 --> 30:47.815
You and your band of
sewer rats running point?

30:47.816 --> 30:48.816
Not gonna happen, John.

30:48.980 --> 30:52.046
No need to involve anyone
else but me on this one.

30:52.048 --> 30:53.982
He'll shred you alone, kid.

30:53.984 --> 30:55.650
That's a win for you also.

30:55.652 --> 30:57.085
Oh, come on...

30:58.253 --> 31:00.989
it doesn't have to be this way.

31:00.991 --> 31:05.926
We can work together, find
common ground again, son.

31:05.928 --> 31:09.162
The only reason I'm here is
you have the resources I need.

31:09.164 --> 31:11.164
Find McCrane, then I'll handle it.

31:12.266 --> 31:13.968
No agents.

31:13.970 --> 31:15.636
So all those years meant nothing to you?

31:15.638 --> 31:17.505
All the knowledge I imparted?

31:17.507 --> 31:19.406
The training?

31:19.408 --> 31:20.908
I raised you, son.

31:22.576 --> 31:25.011
I saved your life. Have you forgotten that?

31:25.013 --> 31:26.245
How could I?

31:28.649 --> 31:30.617
You have my terms.

31:30.619 --> 31:33.520
We'll put every agent
on it, every resource.

31:33.522 --> 31:35.955
When we get a fix on him,
we'll reach out to you.

31:35.957 --> 31:37.156
And then you back off.

31:37.158 --> 31:39.357
I'm going to give a 10 minute lead, John.

31:39.359 --> 31:41.393
Either you catch him or I send in Plan B,

31:41.395 --> 31:43.261
I'm not risking anything with McCrane.

31:51.538 --> 31:54.371
I am not your son.

31:58.143 --> 32:00.511
<i>JEDIKIAH: If you catch
him, you know what to do.</i>

32:18.462 --> 32:20.597
The slightest hiccup, any sign of him,

32:20.599 --> 32:23.033
I want a flag raised, you got it?

32:23.035 --> 32:26.602
I'd rather chase down 1,000
false leads, than lose this one.

32:26.604 --> 32:27.603
Yes, sir.

32:33.477 --> 32:34.944
What are you thinking?

32:37.281 --> 32:40.416
John, you can't kill, he can.
He'll always have the advantage.

32:40.418 --> 32:42.684
- I'll find a way to stop him.
- How?

32:46.255 --> 32:48.022
It's what they trained me to do.

32:53.662 --> 32:55.630
I got a tele-signature.

32:55.632 --> 32:58.032
Parking structure near the garden.

32:58.034 --> 32:59.934
Looks like our guy, sir.

32:59.936 --> 33:02.369
Go ahead, clock's ticking.

33:02.371 --> 33:04.404
<i>(THINKING) John, we found him.</i>

33:04.406 --> 33:05.639
<i>JOHN: I'm on my way.</i>

33:10.011 --> 33:11.478
Wish me luck.

33:11.480 --> 33:12.946
- You're gonna need more than that.
- John...

33:17.218 --> 33:19.486
McCrane!

33:19.488 --> 33:21.887
You wanted me, here I am.

33:21.889 --> 33:23.055
How did you find me?

33:25.391 --> 33:27.292
I'm here to help you.

33:27.294 --> 33:28.311
We can work this out,

33:28.312 --> 33:30.663
but only if you disappear
and never come back.

33:31.332 --> 33:33.398
Go spend your life on
whatever beach you want.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.667
Sipping mai-tais, trying to forget?

33:35.669 --> 33:37.502
What if I can't forget?

33:38.570 --> 33:39.938
(PANTING)

33:41.473 --> 33:43.608
This doesn't end well for you, Killian.

33:43.610 --> 33:45.143
Go...

33:45.145 --> 33:46.611
I promise I won't hunt you.

33:55.687 --> 33:57.154
(LAUGHS)

33:57.156 --> 33:59.189
Who says I won't hunt you?

33:59.191 --> 34:02.092
There is no beach, John.

34:02.094 --> 34:04.018
You want me live underground, like a worm,

34:04.019 --> 34:06.308
in your supernatural refugee camp?

34:07.533 --> 34:10.300
- How did you know we lived...
- It's all in your file, John.

34:10.302 --> 34:12.702
You're moving backwards, devolving.

34:12.704 --> 34:14.040
A hundred million years ago,

34:14.041 --> 34:15.889
we crawled out of the mud
and you want to go back?

34:17.440 --> 34:19.208
We've got confirmation, sir.

34:19.210 --> 34:21.178
Both targets are at the site.

34:21.179 --> 34:23.012
"Both targets"?

34:23.014 --> 34:24.679
- Deploy Alpha unit.
- FEMALE AGENT: Copy that.

34:24.681 --> 34:27.114
ETA, two minutes.

34:27.117 --> 34:28.484
That's the kill squad.

34:30.953 --> 34:32.554
You set John up.

34:32.556 --> 34:34.089
You used him as bait.

34:34.091 --> 34:36.592
Both these men are
Ultra fugitives, Stephen.

34:36.594 --> 34:38.427
That comes with a price.

34:40.228 --> 34:41.329
Now you know.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.001
<i>(THINKING) John.</i>

34:47.003 --> 34:48.369
(GRUNTING)

34:53.509 --> 34:57.411
What did I tell you about
keeping your guard up, huh?

34:57.413 --> 35:00.546
<i>STEPHEN: John, they're coming.
Jedikiah lied about the headstart.</i>

35:03.318 --> 35:06.061
Aw, had to call Daddy to come save you.

35:17.664 --> 35:18.997
This is between you and me.

35:24.971 --> 35:26.665
Ah, a little trip to nowhere.

35:26.674 --> 35:28.306
What is this?

35:28.408 --> 35:30.041
Your last chance.

35:30.093 --> 35:32.059
You know what I think the problem is?

35:33.328 --> 35:34.696
You're jealous.

35:34.698 --> 35:37.331
Jedikiah gave me the gift.

35:37.333 --> 35:39.000
And not you.

35:44.172 --> 35:45.338
Go ahead, pick it up.

35:50.779 --> 35:52.746
Why did you even try to find me?

35:52.748 --> 35:54.715
I'll always have the edge.

35:54.717 --> 35:56.517
As long as I can kill,

35:56.519 --> 35:57.484
and you can't.

36:13.099 --> 36:14.700
You want to know why I left Ultra?

36:17.069 --> 36:18.470
Because they turned me into you.

36:41.446 --> 36:43.847
<i>JOHN: Tell Jedikiah it's over.</i>

36:47.418 --> 36:49.485
He's not responding
anymore, what does that mean?

36:49.487 --> 36:51.287
That it's over?

36:51.289 --> 36:52.955
I guess, I don't know.

36:52.957 --> 36:55.658
I wasn't there. I suppose
I'll just have to trust him.

36:57.494 --> 36:59.796
You used me to set John up.

36:59.798 --> 37:03.799
Oh, come on, Stephen.
These are complicated times.

37:03.801 --> 37:06.568
Powers like yours and McCrane's
have to be harnessed properly,

37:06.570 --> 37:08.337
or it's disaster.

37:08.339 --> 37:10.439
That's why allegiance is paramount.

37:10.441 --> 37:11.773
Allegiance?

37:11.775 --> 37:14.343
What about McCrane? He was Ultra.

37:14.345 --> 37:15.977
Only he didn't steal
those drugs like you said,

37:15.979 --> 37:19.780
you turned him into that monster.

37:19.782 --> 37:22.883
Yeah, I did a little digging in our files.

37:22.885 --> 37:24.819
The Annex Project?

37:24.821 --> 37:28.088
Everything that happened
to McCrane was voluntary.

37:28.090 --> 37:31.726
Stephen, your kind is one
of gene away from perfection.

37:31.728 --> 37:33.627
What, killing?

37:33.629 --> 37:36.363
I thought you wanted to
protect the human race from us.

37:36.365 --> 37:39.733
What better way than to have
the ultimate guardian on my side?

37:39.735 --> 37:42.335
One no breakout could ever contend with.

37:43.738 --> 37:47.874
Your only genetic weakness
amidst so many new strengths.

37:49.477 --> 37:52.678
Finding a fix was worth a few McCranes.

37:56.349 --> 37:58.751
RUSSELL: You are the man!

37:58.753 --> 38:02.388
Getting McCrane to turn tail...
Ah! That's a miracle, brother.

38:02.390 --> 38:04.423
Well, I've known the guy a long time.

38:04.425 --> 38:06.324
I knew he didn't want to fight anymore.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.993
Looks like he had a violent
way of communicating that.

38:08.995 --> 38:11.696
Hey, I admit... it took some convincing.

38:11.698 --> 38:15.032
Liked, you kicked his ass?

38:15.034 --> 38:17.502
He's back to where he came
from, that's all that matters.

38:17.504 --> 38:21.572
Whatever. I'm stealing a keg and
we are getting real in this place.

38:28.012 --> 38:29.546
I'm glad you're home.

38:29.548 --> 38:30.614
Me too.

38:34.886 --> 38:36.352
After all of that,

38:37.722 --> 38:39.988
he just up and leaves.

38:42.392 --> 38:43.926
You really think he'll stay gone?

38:43.928 --> 38:45.961
If he values his life at
all, he's not coming back.

38:49.566 --> 38:51.467
I'm, uh, I'm gonna get this cleaned up.

39:05.815 --> 39:07.381
Making deals with Jedikiah...

39:08.818 --> 39:09.951
it's not like John.

39:11.986 --> 39:14.020
He did what he had to do.

39:14.022 --> 39:17.390
I know I'm usually the one criticizing him.

39:17.392 --> 39:18.859
The way he runs things down here.

39:18.861 --> 39:20.928
I have accused him of being cowardly,

39:22.564 --> 39:24.798
and overly cautious.

39:24.800 --> 39:27.733
I have even questioned
what it is you see in him.

39:29.235 --> 39:30.803
But today was different.

39:31.939 --> 39:33.439
Today I saw it.

39:35.675 --> 39:38.010
You're not developing a
guy crush on him, are you?

39:41.714 --> 39:43.715
The guy's a leader, Cara.

39:46.019 --> 39:47.252
(DOOR OPENING)

39:49.856 --> 39:52.290
- No new bruises today, I hope.
- Not yet.

39:52.292 --> 39:54.058
I may have to watch my
step around you, though.

39:54.060 --> 39:55.759
What does that mean?

39:55.761 --> 39:57.862
The way you came at Jedikiah
last night at dinner...

39:59.865 --> 40:01.466
I've never seen that side of you.

40:03.035 --> 40:06.069
You're kind of bad-ass, Mom.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.805
I had to raise two boys on
my own for the last 10 years.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.609
You gotta be pretty bad-ass to do that.

40:14.678 --> 40:16.546
Stephen...

40:16.548 --> 40:18.915
there are a lot of things
you don't know about me.

40:34.931 --> 40:36.899
What happened to my 10 minute lead?

40:40.869 --> 40:44.506
I knew you couldn't resist backstabbing me.

40:44.508 --> 40:45.873
I'm very proud of you, John.

40:47.643 --> 40:50.378
You finally learned the
consequences of living in the world

40:50.380 --> 40:54.614
with these dark, warped individuals.

40:54.616 --> 40:56.883
You had no choice but to respond in kind.

40:56.885 --> 40:58.919
I left Ultra because you made me kill.

41:00.922 --> 41:03.090
I swore to myself I'd never do it again.

41:03.092 --> 41:05.059
And you haven't.

41:05.061 --> 41:07.094
Till tonight.

41:07.096 --> 41:09.629
You think it's an imperfection.

41:09.631 --> 41:12.498
But I think there's a reason
we were born unable to kill.

41:13.633 --> 41:15.000
It destroys something.

41:16.070 --> 41:18.271
A part of your soul you don't get back.

41:20.541 --> 41:22.708
I felt it today.

41:22.710 --> 41:24.377
Just like I felt it years ago.

41:26.712 --> 41:28.613
I hate you for what you made me.

41:28.615 --> 41:30.715
I made you strong.

41:30.717 --> 41:31.749
Perfect.

41:36.322 --> 41:38.490
We're not running anymore.

41:39.692 --> 41:42.960
From here on, we do everything to stop you.

41:42.962 --> 41:46.530
We see you on the street,
we don't turn, we fight.

41:46.532 --> 41:48.432
Got it?

41:48.434 --> 41:50.000
Kill or be killed, John.

41:54.306 --> 41:55.806
Kill or be killed.
