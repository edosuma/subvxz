SPAIN, 2013

OF THE REDUCTION
OF THEIR SENTENCES.
MADRID V
MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON

00:49.080 --> 00:52.280
MADRID V
MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON

01:05.120 --> 01:09.160
She was really frightened.
She couldn't even scream.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.760
Did you both rape her?

01:14.120 --> 01:15.120
El Patas went first.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.560
He grabbed her by the neck as if

01:19.160 --> 01:20.640
to strangle her.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.160
It's like it turned him on...

01:23.640 --> 01:25.360
Why'd you decide to kill her?

01:25.880 --> 01:29.040
I didn't want to.
El Patas made me.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.000
How?

01:31.120 --> 01:34.520
He yelled...
like a madman, saying...

01:35.760 --> 01:37.080
she'd seen our faces.

01:37.080 --> 01:37.120
she'd seen our faces.
If she talked...
we'd both be behind bars.

01:37.120 --> 01:40.160
If she talked...
we'd both be behind bars.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.520
So, he didn't make you.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.000
I thought you were here
to help me.

01:52.120 --> 01:54.560
I want to know
what's causing your anxiety.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.800
That's why I need to know
exactly what happened.

02:02.840 --> 02:04.000
You'll feel better.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.160
The girl was lying...

02:14.520 --> 02:16.800
on the ground, like unconscious.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.040
El Patas wanted to kill her
with a rock.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.800
It was really heavy, like...

02:24.760 --> 02:26.840
twenty or 30 kilos maybe.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.040
She came round
and tried to run away,

02:30.120 --> 02:32.880
and that prick
kicked her hard in the head.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.040
Her neck was...

02:37.320 --> 02:39.360
twisted, like a broken spring.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.120
He just kept going
and yelling and yelling.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.040
Why?

02:45.160 --> 02:46.280
He wanted...

02:46.360 --> 02:48.040
-...to get rid of the body?
-No.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.760
She was still breathing.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.840
That bastard said
it would be easier with a rock.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.600
So, I went for her,
I smashed her nose,

02:59.760 --> 03:00.800
I busted her eyes,

03:01.320 --> 03:05.280
her jaw, I hit her and hit her
and she wouldn't die!

03:11.320 --> 03:13.880
It was like a damn hole,
with no eyes, like...

03:14.320 --> 03:17.880
her forehead...
it had caved in, you get me?

03:27.560 --> 03:29.280
You think about it every day.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.840
That's why you can't sleep.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.520
How long have you been
in prison?

03:39.640 --> 03:40.640
Twenty years.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.000
-You think you deserve freedom?
-No.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.880
Girl, yesterday was awful.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.640
You'll never guess
what happened.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.080
I'm booking this guy in,

04:01.520 --> 04:05.040
I ask him for his finger
to run his prints

04:05.120 --> 04:07.560
and the guy
asks me for my number.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.040
Was he cute?

04:09.320 --> 04:11.160
Jesus, he'd been arrested

04:11.320 --> 04:13.760
for breaking into
a high-end store.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.000
Even better!

04:16.280 --> 04:18.120
There's something wrong
with you.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.280
Sit there,
my colleague is on his way.

04:24.520 --> 04:27.000
-The commissioner wants you...
-Don't talk to me.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.280
The Parot decision
from the Strasbourg Court

04:29.520 --> 04:31.560
has stirred up our
correctional system

04:31.760 --> 04:33.040
but how did it all begin?

04:33.120 --> 04:36.040
For our Supreme Court,
the benefits of...

04:36.160 --> 04:38.040
-What's up?
-How's it going, Nieto?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.040
All that work for nothing.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.760
-It's horrible.
-What are we even doing here?

04:45.000 --> 04:46.320
They should
make those judges

04:46.520 --> 04:48.640
run checkpoints
on the highway in Hernani.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.080
Defusing car bombs.

04:50.080 --> 04:50.120
Defusing car bombs.
-Then they'd realize...
-No doubt.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.600
-Then they'd realize...
-No doubt.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.080
I'm giving a talk
at my kid's school.

04:55.080 --> 04:55.120
I'm giving a talk
at my kid's school.
What am I supposed to say?

04:55.120 --> 04:56.320
What am I supposed to say?

04:57.280 --> 05:00.160
-What are you doing, Nieto?
-Muffins.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.040
Top left, handsome.

05:03.880 --> 05:08.000
-We've got to keep at it.
-We should all resign.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.000
...release them in Strasbourg.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.040
-Can I please finish?
-We'll continue this later,

05:13.120 --> 05:15.280
but the news media
all agree

05:15.360 --> 05:17.000
that the court has failed.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.560
We interrupt this broadcast
to bring you breaking news.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.520
The first prisoners
are released

05:44.640 --> 05:46.880
following the annulment
of the Parot Doctrine.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.320
Six prisoners charged
with different crimes,

05:49.520 --> 05:52.080
such as rape and pedophilia,
have been released...

06:08.040 --> 06:10.040
Where the hell are you going?

06:10.800 --> 06:13.000
What about us, assholes?

06:14.520 --> 06:18.000
Hey Chufo, what will you say
to your wife?

06:18.840 --> 06:20.760
-I don't know, Patas.
-I don't know, Patas.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.080
"Honey, can you crack a window?

06:24.280 --> 06:26.280
It reeks of infidelity in here".

06:28.400 --> 06:29.400
Son of a bitch.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.520
They're waiting for you and you
in your best shirt. Look at him.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.760
Next.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.520
Roberto Plaza.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.320
-Number?
-Two, five, seven.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.520
Watch it, Plaza,
that lighter is mine.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.080
If I report you,
you'll be staying inside.

06:52.520 --> 06:53.560
Quiet.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.000
-What?
-Shut it.

06:56.600 --> 06:57.600
Name?

06:58.160 --> 06:59.640
Daniel Molina.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.280
Here?

07:03.560 --> 07:04.560
There.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.520
Plaza... we should
reward ourselves.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.840
Together... like old times.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.800
You must be tired of cock.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Enough, asshole.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.840
Nobody talks to me like that.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.280
Hey!

08:20.400 --> 08:22.000
Two mistakes:

08:22.120 --> 08:23.760
-One, you stole a bike.
-Okay, okay.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.400
Two, you stole a cop's bike.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.000
Operation is a go.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.120
Roger.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.800
Sayonara, sucker.

09:19.520 --> 09:22.600
-Rapists!
-Sickos!

09:22.760 --> 09:23.760
Bastards!

09:24.280 --> 09:25.280
You son of a bitch!

09:31.040 --> 09:32.800
Raúl, that's them.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.280
They let them go...

09:39.400 --> 09:42.400
They let those bastards go.
You bastards!

09:42.840 --> 09:43.840
Move.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.280
Bastards! Murderers!

09:47.400 --> 09:49.000
Murderers!

09:49.040 --> 09:51.080
Bastards!

09:51.080 --> 09:52.640
-Murderers!
-Murderers!

09:53.120 --> 09:54.120
What?

09:54.560 --> 09:55.800
She was just a girl!

09:56.000 --> 09:57.120
How many years
behind bars?

09:57.280 --> 09:59.080
Any words
for the victim's family?

09:59.280 --> 10:00.760
-What?
-How does it feel?

10:00.880 --> 10:02.360
-Some crowd, huh?
-Beat it.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.280
You have nothing to say?

10:04.520 --> 10:05.800
Get that camera off me.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.080
You're dead, you son of a bitch!

10:08.280 --> 10:09.560
Look at me!

10:09.760 --> 10:11.160
She suffered for hours.

10:11.840 --> 10:12.840
You bastards!

10:14.520 --> 10:15.520
Bastards!

10:15.840 --> 10:17.320
Go to hell!

10:27.520 --> 10:28.520
JUSTICE

10:38.080 --> 10:39.120
We want justice!

11:02.160 --> 11:03.560
-Hey.
-Hi.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.560
-Why aren't you dressed?
-You were gone a while.

11:06.760 --> 11:10.520
I had time to lose my bike,
get it back and buy groceries.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.760
You're not even dressed.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.600
-I made breakfast.
-What do you want?

11:18.080 --> 11:19.800
I hate how much you know me.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.080
-Sixteen years.
-Right.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.160
Lucía asked me
if I would sleep over tonight.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.360
-Are you going out?
-I don't think so.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.840
Should I call
and ask her parents?

11:31.160 --> 11:35.040
I don't get why curfew is at 12.
My friends stay out till 4am.

11:35.040 --> 11:37.520
Lucía's parents let her
go out until 4am?

11:37.640 --> 11:40.040
Lucía's parents are going away.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.120
Lucía will be home alone.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.040
That makes sense.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.120
No, her older sister
will be there.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.560
She's almost your age,

11:48.760 --> 11:50.800
but she seems
much more fun than you.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.400
Great! Lucía has someone
to go out with then.

11:53.560 --> 11:56.760
-Because you won't be going.
-It's always the same with you.

12:04.360 --> 12:05.320
-Hey.
-Hi.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.360
The president
read out the ruling...

12:07.560 --> 12:08.640
Hey, Grandma.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.520
You aren't dressed.
We'll be late for the dentist.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.120
What was Mom's curfew at my age.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.320
-Midnight.
-You're such a bad liar.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.120
It's like living in a convent.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.360
I have the curfew
of a 12-year-old.

12:20.760 --> 12:23.120
You'll love it
when I'm sniffing coke at 6pm.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.520
Well, you won't confuse it
for detergent.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.160
You've yet to do the laundry.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.120
...a maximum 30-year sentence.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.640
The Spanish government warned

12:30.800 --> 12:32.360
that the end
of the Parot Doctrine

12:32.520 --> 12:35.560
means hundreds
of criminals and rapists

12:35.760 --> 12:37.120
will be set free.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.360
The latest to be released

12:38.520 --> 12:40.360
is aristocrat
Julián López de Haro.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.160
His was highly-anticipated
and did not disappoint.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.400
Even after years
spent behind bars,

12:46.560 --> 12:49.120
he still has
the air of arrogance

12:49.320 --> 12:52.280
he had when he appeared
at fashion shows in the '90s.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.080
You're so clumsy, Mom.

12:54.080 --> 12:54.120
You're so clumsy, Mom.
Maybe you're the one
who shouldn't go out.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.160
Maybe you're the one
who shouldn't go out.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.280
...he refused to comment.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.080
What will you do now
that you're out of prison?

13:01.080 --> 13:01.120
What will you do now
that you're out of prison?
-Can we please have a comment?
-Excuse me!

13:01.120 --> 13:04.360
-Can we please have a comment?
-Excuse me!

13:06.080 --> 13:08.040
Do you have anything to say?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.600
How do you think
you'll be received?

13:10.760 --> 13:11.880
How will people react?

13:13.600 --> 13:16.280
Excuse me, how does it feel?

13:17.760 --> 13:19.040
Excuse me.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.040
Home sweet home.

15:11.760 --> 15:12.800
You smell of booze.

15:13.320 --> 15:15.840
I've been celebrating all night.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.320
A shot for each release

15:18.520 --> 15:21.040
and another
for every year they won't serve.

15:21.040 --> 15:21.080
and another
for every year they won't serve.
Good or bad, the law is the law.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.280
Good or bad, the law is the law.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.640
Did you come up
with that yourself?

15:27.080 --> 15:30.120
-Perfection must be tiring.
-Someone has to be.

15:30.560 --> 15:31.560
What happened?

15:34.040 --> 15:36.040
I knocked it.
Nothing to worry about.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.080
It's just weird
seeing you bleed.

15:40.280 --> 15:42.120
I thought you were
made of stone.

15:56.280 --> 15:59.080
Good afternoon, sir.
Can I help you with something?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Yes.

16:01.520 --> 16:03.320
I'd like this one, please.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.840
The processor power
won't disappoint.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
I'm sure.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.120
The one I've got is from 1995.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.840
You really got
some use out of it.

16:14.760 --> 16:15.800
I barely touched it.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.520
ARISTOCRAT
JULIÁN LÓPEZ DE HARO

16:41.640 --> 16:43.640
LEAVING
SOTO DEL REAL PRISON

17:10.600 --> 17:13.160
I'm gonna go pee
over there.

17:42.760 --> 17:43.760
Don't move.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.400
Shut your face.
Shut up!

17:50.000 --> 17:51.040
Shut your face!

18:02.760 --> 18:03.760
Help!

18:06.280 --> 18:08.120
Daniel Molina, AKA "El Patas".

18:09.120 --> 18:12.520
It seems he tried to rape a girl
and he met the same fate

18:12.640 --> 18:14.840
the girl he was imprisoned
for murdering did:

18:15.000 --> 18:17.280
-beaten to death with a rock.
-Poetic justice.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.000
People taking matters
into their own hands.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.040
Just what we needed.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.280
That's what happens
when the system abandons you.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.760
Look, Nieto, you can keep
the speeches for Congress

18:27.000 --> 18:29.080
and last I checked,
you're no congressman.

18:29.080 --> 18:29.120
and last I checked,
you're no congressman.
I couldn't be,
I have principles.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.320
I couldn't be,
I have principles.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.760
-Do you like anyone?
-I like you, sir.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.040
Don't screw around. Get on this.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.400
I have three unsolved cases.

18:40.560 --> 18:43.400
Innocent senior citizens stabbed
while being burgled.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.520
-They're priority, right?
-Give them to Isabel.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.800
I want you on this.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.280
Who cares
who took that guy out?

18:50.560 --> 18:53.000
I care...
and so do the people up top.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.040
I want a list of suspects
this week.

18:55.160 --> 18:59.040
-How many people live in Spain?
-Don't try me, Nieto.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.800
Those are his victim's brothers.
Start with them.

19:09.360 --> 19:10.360
Thank you.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.760
I'm now embarrassed to be a cop.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.840
Close the door after you.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.120
Nieto.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.040
Goddammit.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.120
Do we know
the cause of death yet?

19:28.040 --> 19:30.520
Thirty two cocktail umbrellas
in his stomach.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.160
Seriously? Damn Russians.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.080
A shot to the stomach
would have been less painful.

19:36.560 --> 19:37.840
And less interesting.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.080
-You've got homework.
-Excuse me?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.040
Commissioner asked me
to pass on my cases.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.040
-Taking a vacation?
-No.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.400
I have to find the killer
of a rapist ex-con.

19:49.040 --> 19:51.080
Go enforce the law
you love so much.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.280
Any idea who it was?

19:53.400 --> 19:57.040
Well, it wasn't a Russian.
They're not that subtle.

19:57.280 --> 20:01.120
Just his victim's brothers.
A couple of laborers.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.800
Many have asked for examples
for your Master's theses

20:15.000 --> 20:17.160
so I'll tell you
what I'm working on.

20:17.880 --> 20:18.880
Premise...

20:19.040 --> 20:20.840
PREMISE

20:21.040 --> 20:24.760
More than 80% of male prisoners

20:24.840 --> 20:27.280
suffer with an anxiety disorder.

20:27.520 --> 20:28.320
Why?

20:28.520 --> 20:30.880
Research focuses
on the most common causes:

20:31.040 --> 20:33.760
Isolation, drugs,
social exclusion...

20:33.880 --> 20:36.040
But that's too easy, right?

20:36.160 --> 20:37.160
Hypothesis.

20:40.320 --> 20:42.000
Where was I?

20:42.040 --> 20:45.600
Is it possible for inmates
to suffer from PTSD?

20:46.760 --> 20:48.400
That the trauma of a murder

20:48.560 --> 20:51.280
affects the perpetrator
as well as the victim?

20:52.000 --> 20:55.880
The study held 30 interviews
carried out in prison,

20:56.160 --> 20:59.760
all of which were
with violent criminals.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.320
Does a terrorist having anxiety
really matter?

21:03.080 --> 21:05.040
And what about gang-rapists?

21:05.040 --> 21:07.640
Shall we start a softball league
so they can blow off steam?

21:09.120 --> 21:10.120
Right.

21:12.160 --> 21:15.280
Put down the placard.
We're here to learn not protest.

21:16.040 --> 21:19.840
I study theory to enact change,
not justify crime.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.040
They're monsters
and should be treated as such.

21:22.520 --> 21:25.520
Okay, Laura, so what do we do?
Put them on death row?

21:25.640 --> 21:28.320
Capital punishment is
a breach of human rights.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.880
Justice isn't the same
as revenge.

21:31.160 --> 21:34.520
-What do you mean?
-I've been working

21:34.640 --> 21:37.840
with victims
and their families for 15 years.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.280
I can assure you
there's nothing worse

21:40.400 --> 21:42.040
than a crime
that goes unpunished.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.040
That's why we have the law.

21:45.080 --> 21:46.400
The damage is irreparable,

21:47.280 --> 21:50.160
-but there must be consequences.
-What if the law abandons you?

21:53.560 --> 21:55.560
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.560
I told you to wait outside.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.160
You were taking too long
and I got bored.

22:09.320 --> 22:12.040
Let's get to the point.
What do you want?

22:13.040 --> 22:16.040
Can I...
stay with you tonight?

22:16.800 --> 22:17.800
Sure.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.840
So long as you're home by 12.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.040
Of course.

22:21.640 --> 22:26.280
But let's imagine I miss my bus
and get home a little late

22:26.360 --> 22:29.080
-will you tell your daughter?
-Absolutely.

22:29.080 --> 22:29.120
-will you tell your daughter?
-Absolutely.
I live in a police state.
I'm so tired of this.

22:29.120 --> 22:32.120
I live in a police state.
I'm so tired of this.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.400
-What is it?
-Here, Sol.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.080
-Wait for me in the car.
-Why?

22:38.280 --> 22:39.560
I said wait in the car.

22:40.280 --> 22:41.560
Go!

22:43.640 --> 22:45.760
Andrea. Take it easy.

22:46.360 --> 22:48.600
I need your help, please.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.800
-Why are you here?
-Something happened...

22:52.000 --> 22:53.160
and I'm real scared.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.280
I need your help. I don't...

22:57.080 --> 22:58.560
I don't know what to do.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.400
-I'll meet you there.
-Okay.

23:34.320 --> 23:35.760
Excuse me, can I help you?

23:37.160 --> 23:38.320
Police.

23:38.520 --> 23:39.880
I'm looking for Raúl
and José Román.

23:40.360 --> 23:43.000
You'll have to wait
till they've finished work.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.040
Is it this way?

23:44.040 --> 23:44.080
Is it this way?
It's authorized personnel only.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.840
It's authorized personnel only.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.640
-Great.
-You need a hard hat!

23:48.800 --> 23:51.560
-Don't worry, I'll be liable.
-Goddammit.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.560
Do you have a minute?

24:10.120 --> 24:11.400
I need to ask you something.

24:12.120 --> 24:14.400
-Why?
-I'm the one asking questions.

24:14.560 --> 24:17.040
If you answer them,
we can get this over with.

24:18.280 --> 24:20.640
Where were you
between 10am and 12pm?

24:20.840 --> 24:22.040
What the hell is this?

24:23.120 --> 24:24.120
Are you accusing us?

24:24.120 --> 24:26.520
One of your sister's killers

24:27.120 --> 24:28.320
turned up dead.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.760
-What?
-First you release him from jail

24:32.600 --> 24:36.040
and now you want to arrest us?
Is this justice?

24:36.040 --> 24:36.080
and now you want to arrest us?
Is this justice?
-Raúl, stop.
-Just answer my question.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.760
-Raúl, stop.
-Just answer my question.

24:38.880 --> 24:41.760
I won't answer any
of your damn questions.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.880
I should have killed him!

24:44.360 --> 24:48.000
The same way he killed her.
One blow at a time!

24:49.280 --> 24:53.080
Let him suffer through the agony
that my sister did.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.040
I'm sorry.

25:05.280 --> 25:07.040
We were at the hospital.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.760
With my mom.
Ask at Ramón y Cajal.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.120
An emergency?

25:11.640 --> 25:12.640
I wish.

25:13.600 --> 25:16.080
She's not been right in the head
since my sister died.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.640
I'm doing mine
on The Little Prince.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.760
It's so much more
than a kid's book....

27:25.040 --> 27:26.040
What about you?

27:28.120 --> 27:29.840
-Hello?
-About Cortázar.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.280
Right, but which one
of his books?

27:34.520 --> 27:35.520
Hopscotch?

27:36.320 --> 27:38.560
-Have you read it?
-No. Not yet.

27:39.320 --> 27:43.280
My mom told me it's really good.
Very innovative for the time.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.320
May I?

28:01.280 --> 28:02.520
Thank you.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.040
You like Cortázar?

28:07.520 --> 28:10.800
I don't know.
Someone just recommended him.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.040
Are you in love?

28:12.560 --> 28:15.320
-Excuse me?
-It's only for people in love.

28:15.880 --> 28:17.040
-Trust me.
-Really?

28:17.760 --> 28:21.120
-What if I'm not?
-The Catcher in the Rye.

28:21.280 --> 28:24.080
It's a classic.
It changed my life.

28:24.280 --> 28:27.400
It deals with adolescent angst
and sexuality very well.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.000
I read that two years ago.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.120
It draws a great picture
of teenage boredom.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.520
You have standards.

28:36.640 --> 28:37.800
They're misguided,

28:38.160 --> 28:39.320
but you have them.

28:40.520 --> 28:41.880
And you're intense.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.520
Pleasant, but intense.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.560
-Hello.
-How do you know I go here?

29:16.120 --> 29:18.040
I'm smart as well as intense.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.040
-What do you want?
-To take you for a snack.

29:23.760 --> 29:25.040
I'm not a kid.

29:26.120 --> 29:28.760
Well, I was going to take you
to a tea room

29:28.840 --> 29:31.040
to try the best cream cakes
in the world.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.080
But it's your loss.

29:33.280 --> 29:37.000
-Your dad wants his car back.
-It's mine, I'm a lawyer.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.280
That's where the air
of superiority comes from.

29:41.560 --> 29:42.560
This isn't my lucky day.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.160
Won't you get in?

30:00.520 --> 30:01.520
No.

30:04.640 --> 30:05.640
No.

30:17.840 --> 30:19.320
This is my number.

30:20.120 --> 30:22.080
I like things done right.

30:22.280 --> 30:26.120
You can call me, ask me out,
and I'll make my mind up.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.120
-Is that permanent marker?
-No.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.160
I'd tattoo your name on me
if I knew it.

30:32.360 --> 30:33.760
That's private.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.160
The phone thing is very cool...

30:38.000 --> 30:39.080
I'm more of a romantic.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.040
I'm throwing a costume party
this Saturday.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.360
I'd love for you to come.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.040
López de Haro.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.280
-Julián.
-Julián.

30:55.840 --> 30:56.880
I'll see you there.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.280
-Good evening.
-Hi.

31:53.400 --> 31:54.800
Please come in, miss.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.120
May I take your jacket, miss?

32:14.320 --> 32:15.800
Sorry?

32:16.840 --> 32:19.840
-I'll take it to the coat-check.
-Oh, yes. Thank you.

32:38.560 --> 32:39.640
I knew you'd come.

32:41.280 --> 32:42.280
Hi.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.040
I almost didn't.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.000
What did you come as?

32:50.040 --> 32:55.040
Like a sort of fairy
or wood nymph, I'm not sure.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.520
It was all they had.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.160
It suits you.

32:58.360 --> 33:00.520
-Okay, I'll tell you my name.
-No.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.600
I haven't earned that right yet.
Let's toast.

33:04.320 --> 33:06.040
This is the best from my cellar.

33:07.520 --> 33:08.840
I don't like champagne.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.840
I opened the bottle for you.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.560
-Okay.
-Cheers.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.040
No.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.880
You have to let it saturate
your palette.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.800
Let it refresh your mouth. Okay?

33:30.120 --> 33:31.120
Good.

33:33.640 --> 33:34.880
Julián.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.160
The guys
from the Swiss fund are here.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.040
Let me introduce you.

33:41.040 --> 33:42.040
Go.

33:43.360 --> 33:44.360
Let's go.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.160
I'm so sorry.

34:04.880 --> 34:05.880
Thank you.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.760
Run, Cinderella. It's midnight!

35:48.760 --> 35:49.760
No!

35:51.880 --> 35:53.280
No, please!

35:56.880 --> 35:58.280
You won't remember tomorrow.

36:22.600 --> 36:25.000
Please, leave me alone.

37:11.880 --> 37:12.880
Isabel?

37:14.120 --> 37:15.320
Isabel, what's wrong?

37:17.280 --> 37:18.880
What's wrong with you?

37:19.080 --> 37:22.840
What are you doing? Stop that!
Put those down. What...

37:24.600 --> 37:27.280
What happened to you?
Who did this?

37:27.840 --> 37:31.280
What happened to you, sweetie?
What happened? Who did this?

37:31.760 --> 37:34.520
Tell me. Tell me who did this.
Tell me!

40:22.040 --> 40:27.040
WHO WAS IT?

42:02.280 --> 42:03.400
Sol.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.880
Sol.

42:10.320 --> 42:11.520
Hey.

42:13.400 --> 42:14.880
I know you're awake.

42:20.320 --> 42:21.520
Damn!

42:53.040 --> 42:54.040
Pick up.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.280
Please, pick up.

42:58.400 --> 42:59.600
Pick up.

43:12.760 --> 43:13.760
Where were you?

43:14.160 --> 43:17.560
Don't ever do that to me again.
Do you hear me? Never!

43:19.040 --> 43:21.160
You're reckless.
Just think!

43:22.000 --> 43:23.280
Something could have
happened to you.

43:25.280 --> 43:27.560
What are you wearing?
That isn't yours.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.160
I'm wearing
what all the girls are, Mom.

43:31.840 --> 43:33.000
I'm so sick of this.

43:34.520 --> 43:37.120
I'm done. You're crazy.

43:37.120 --> 43:39.280
Don't you realize
I'm living your life,

43:39.360 --> 43:42.120
not the one I want?
Dammit, I need a life, Mom.

44:45.040 --> 44:46.040
Hello?

44:49.160 --> 44:52.800
-Keep looking.
-His brains are everywhere.

44:53.760 --> 44:56.000
The fragility of the human body,
Nieto.

44:56.120 --> 44:58.800
-We're nothing really.
-Who is this guy?

44:59.000 --> 45:01.280
-A Parot early release.
-Are you sure?

45:02.040 --> 45:04.880
-Another rapist like El Patas?
-Yes, but this one liked kids.

45:05.160 --> 45:08.800
Miguel Guzmán.
Charged with child abuse.

45:09.160 --> 45:10.280
One less pedophile.

45:11.760 --> 45:12.760
Look.

45:15.840 --> 45:18.760
-He didn't kill his victims?
-Not directly.

45:19.160 --> 45:23.040
A 10-year-old kid couldn't go on
and threw himself from a window.

45:23.760 --> 45:26.280
-This could be a suicide.
-He had this on him.

45:27.760 --> 45:30.880
-"Time served."
-Obviously, he didn't write it.

45:31.160 --> 45:35.320
Maybe his last words,
or a sign of remorse.

45:35.520 --> 45:38.120
Forensics found it stuck
to his brains.

45:39.280 --> 45:42.120
This one plunged to his death,
just like his victim did.

45:42.560 --> 45:45.120
Jesus,
we've got ourselves a vigilante.

45:51.840 --> 45:54.040
They may be killers,
pedophiles and rapists,

45:54.120 --> 45:55.840
but they have a right
to protection.

45:56.080 --> 45:58.280
Taking this case
goes against my values.

45:58.360 --> 46:01.040
If everyone laid down the law,
you'd be out of a job.

46:01.400 --> 46:04.880
I'd make twice as much,
but this is a labor of love.

46:05.040 --> 46:06.600
We're not getting anywhere.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.080
Look, Nieto, this thing is bad,
the Strasbourg ruling

46:11.080 --> 46:11.120
Look, Nieto, this thing is bad,
the Strasbourg ruling
is the most disputed measure
this government has seen.

46:11.120 --> 46:13.760
is the most disputed measure
this government has seen.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.760
People are clamoring
for releases.

46:15.880 --> 46:17.840
You're telling me
a serial killer shows up

46:18.040 --> 46:20.040
who wants to take out
all these ex-cons,

46:20.160 --> 46:23.120
and according to you,
we shouldn't lift a finger?

46:23.640 --> 46:26.080
-I won't change my mind.
-I'm not asking you to.

46:26.280 --> 46:29.120
I want you to solve the case.
You're the best.

46:30.160 --> 46:33.080
Well... you both are.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.640
-Both of us?
-You and Isabel.

46:35.800 --> 46:38.600
You're going to partner up.
I don't know what went down

46:38.760 --> 46:41.760
or what didn't between you two,
and I don't care.

46:41.880 --> 46:45.040
You're working together,
and the sooner you finish,

46:45.160 --> 46:47.040
the sooner you go
your separate ways.

46:53.280 --> 46:54.320
Christ, Nieto.

46:56.080 --> 46:57.080
Right, get to work.

46:57.280 --> 46:59.320
We have nothing
on the El Patas case.

46:59.520 --> 47:02.760
What about the pedophile?
Any idea who could have done it?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.160
-A monkey.
-Nieto, work with me here.

47:06.560 --> 47:07.800
I am.

47:08.040 --> 47:10.800
A monkey threw him
over the railing.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.040
-A generic monkey mask.
-Damn.

47:27.640 --> 47:29.120
-Commissioner.
-Come in.

47:30.280 --> 47:32.880
You and Nieto are working
this case together.

47:35.040 --> 47:37.120
We have to find
the ex-con killer.

47:39.800 --> 47:41.040
Or, more to the point,

47:41.120 --> 47:44.040
protect pedophiles,
rapists and terrorists.
