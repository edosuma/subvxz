00:03.169 --> 00:05.160
( bugs chittering )

00:26.860 --> 00:28.851
( brakes squeak)

00:30.697 --> 00:34.155
- ( engine stops)
- ( trunk clicks)

00:37.954 --> 00:39.945
(bird cawing)

01:33.551 --> 01:35.542
(birds chirping)

02:12.382 --> 02:14.373
(flies buzzing )

02:19.639 --> 02:21.630
( metal rattling )

02:45.790 --> 02:47.781
( shuffling footsteps )

03:29.459 --> 03:31.199
Little girl?

03:32.462 --> 03:34.327
I'm a policeman.

03:34.505 --> 03:36.587
Little girl.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.714
Don't be afraid, okay?

03:45.516 --> 03:47.381
Little girl.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.393
( panting )

03:59.739 --> 04:01.730
(growling)

04:06.329 --> 04:08.069
Oh my God.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.876
(theme music playing )

04:59.799 --> 04:59.912
- ( police radio chatter)
- Man: What's the difference

04:59.924 --> 05:01.630
- ( police radio chatter)
- Man: What's the difference

05:01.801 --> 05:03.007
between men and women?

05:03.177 --> 05:05.509
- Man #2: This a joke?
- No, I'm serious.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.590
Man #2: I never met a woman
who knew how to turn off a light.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.723
They're born thinking
the switch only goes one way--

05:11.894 --> 05:14.055
- on.
- ( mutters)

05:14.230 --> 05:16.642
They're struck blind
the second they leave a room.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.977
I mean every woman
I ever let have a key--

05:19.152 --> 05:22.189
I swear to God,
it's like I come home,

05:22.363 --> 05:25.070
house all lit up.
( chuckles)

05:25.241 --> 05:27.072
And my job,
you see, apparently——

05:27.243 --> 05:29.734
because my chromosomes
happen to be different--

05:29.912 --> 05:31.652
is I've then gotta walk
through that house,

05:31.831 --> 05:34.413
turn off every single light
this chick left on.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.326
- Is that right?
- Yeah, baby. Mmm.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.494
Oh, Reverend Shane is
preaching to you now, boy.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.503
( both laugh )

05:41.674 --> 05:44.006
Then-- the same chick, mind you--

05:44.177 --> 05:47.089
she'll bitch about global warming.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.925
You see, this is-- this is
when Reverend Shane wants

05:50.099 --> 05:52.681
to quote from
the guy gospel and say,

05:52.852 --> 05:57.016
"Darling, maybe you and every other
pair of boobs on this planet

05:57.190 --> 06:00.353
just figure out the light switch,
you see, goes both ways,

06:00.526 --> 06:03.313
maybe we wouldn't have so much
global warming." You know?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.194
- You say that?
-Mmm.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.277
Yeah, well, a polite version.
( laughs )

06:08.451 --> 06:11.943
Still, man, that earns me this look

06:12.121 --> 06:14.112
of loathing you would not believe.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.531
And that's when
the "Exorcist" voice pops out.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.621
( deep voice )
"You sound just like my damn father!

06:19.796 --> 06:22.503
Always yelling
about the power bill,

06:22.673 --> 06:24.209
telling me to turn off
the damn lights!"

06:24.384 --> 06:27.046
- And what do you say to that?
- I know what I want to say.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.881
I want to say,
"Bitch, you mean to tell me

06:29.055 --> 06:30.545
you've been hearing this
your entire life

06:30.723 --> 06:33.305
and you are still too damn stupid
to learn how to turn off a switch?"

06:33.476 --> 06:35.512
( both laugh )

06:35.686 --> 06:39.019
You know, |--
I don't actually say that though.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.896
- That would be bad.
- Right right.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.604
Yeah, I go with the--
| go with the polite version there too.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.609
- Very wise.
- Yes sir.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.566
- Mm-hmm.
-We||.

06:51.035 --> 06:53.321
So how's it with Lori, man?

06:53.496 --> 06:56.238
She's good-- she's good
at turning off lights.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.374
Really good. I'm the one
who sometimes forgets.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.535
Not what I meant.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.426
- We didn't have a great night.
- Hey look, man,

07:07.593 --> 07:10.460
I may have failed
to amuse with my sermon,

07:10.638 --> 07:12.503
but I did try.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.219
The least you can
do is-- is speak.

07:16.352 --> 07:18.263
That's-- that's what
she always says.

07:18.438 --> 07:22.101
"Speak. Speak."

07:22.275 --> 07:25.563
You'd think l was the most
closed-mouth son of a bitch ever

07:25.736 --> 07:27.442
to hear her tell it.

07:29.323 --> 07:31.188
Do you express your thoughts?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.784
Do you share your feelings,
that kind of stuff?

07:37.039 --> 07:39.075
The thing is--

07:40.585 --> 07:42.701
lately, whenever I try,

07:42.879 --> 07:46.167
everything I say
makes her impatient,

07:46.340 --> 07:48.296
like she didn't want
to hear it after all.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.292
It's like she's...

07:51.471 --> 07:54.258
pissed at me all the time
and I don't know why.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.966
Look, man. That's just shit
couples go through.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.305
Yeah, it's a phase.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.815
The last thing
she said this morning,

08:06.986 --> 08:10.729
"Sometimes I wonder
if you even care about us at all."

08:12.867 --> 08:15.904
She said that
in front of our kid.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.699
lmagine going to school
with that in your head.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.494
The difference
between men and women?

08:27.840 --> 08:30.547
I would never say something
that cruel to her...

08:30.718 --> 08:33.004
and certainly not
in front of Carl.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.172
( radio beeps )

08:38.351 --> 08:40.012
Dispatcher:
All available units,

08:40.186 --> 08:41.517
high-speed pursuit in progress.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.803
Linden County units
request local assistance.

08:46.859 --> 08:49.692
2-17, 2-4-3.
Advise extreme caution.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.274
- ( engine starts)
- ( siren blaring )

09:02.875 --> 09:04.706
Dispatcher:
Suspects are two male Caucasians.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.163
Be advised they have fired
upon police officers.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.203
One Linden County officer
is wounded.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.379
(tires screeching )

09:19.225 --> 09:22.092
Dispatcher:
Unit 1, unit 3, to eastbound Route 18,

09:22.270 --> 09:24.056
two miles west of Interstate 85.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.642
Will patch in
Linden County sheriff radio.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.226
Man over radio:
Roger that. We're five minutes south

09:28.401 --> 09:30.642
of the Route 18 intersection.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.731
Man #2 over radio:
Dispatch, unit 1 and unit 3,

09:32.905 --> 09:35.021
we are 10-97 and code 100,

09:35.199 --> 09:37.781
Highway 18,
EB. of interstate, please advise.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.740
Man on radio: 10-9,
we just got word from Linden County

09:41.914 --> 09:43.575
that they're off 18,
now southbound--

09:43.749 --> 09:46.331
( tires screech )

09:47.587 --> 09:48.872
Old French Road
is closed down there

09:49.046 --> 09:50.752
so they're gonna head
back onto 18.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.339
(guns cock)

09:54.510 --> 09:58.094
Sounds like they chasing those idiots
up and down every back road we've got.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.879
Maybe we'll get on one of them
video shows, you know?

10:00.057 --> 10:01.968
Like "World's Craziest Police Chases."
What do you think?

10:02.143 --> 10:03.929
What I think, Leon,
is you need to stay focused,

10:04.103 --> 10:06.389
make sure you've got a round
in the chamber and your safety off.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.555
( distant sirens )

10:14.030 --> 10:16.362
Would be kinda cool,
getting on one of them shows.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.610
- ( engine rewing)
- ( sirens blaring )

10:31.255 --> 10:33.746
- ( crashes )
- ( tires screech )

10:59.408 --> 11:01.399
(engine putters)

11:03.913 --> 11:05.528
Holy shit.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.121
(car door opens)

11:27.978 --> 11:29.809
- Gun gun gun!
- Put it down!

11:29.980 --> 11:31.971
Man:
Put the gun down!

11:38.030 --> 11:39.645
Ah!

11:54.088 --> 11:56.670
( grunts, wheezes )

12:04.974 --> 12:06.384
Shane: Rick!

12:06.559 --> 12:08.550
I'm all right!
( wheezing )

12:12.314 --> 12:13.724
I saw you get tagged, man.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.275
That scared the hell out of me.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.308
Me too.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.477
That son of a bitch shot me.

12:19.655 --> 12:22.067
- You believe that?
- What? It catch you in your vest?

12:22.241 --> 12:23.822
Yeah.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.903
Shane, you do not tell Lori
that happened-- ever.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.663
- You understand? Ah!
- ( gunshot)

12:32.918 --> 12:35.751
- Man: Police, move in!
- Shane: No no no no no no no.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.378
- Man #2: You see where he come from?
- Shh shh shh shh.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.414
No no no no
no no no no.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.924
He's hit!

12:42.094 --> 12:44.801
Leon! You get
that ambulance down here!

12:44.972 --> 12:46.928
You tell them there's
an officer down! You do it now!

12:47.099 --> 12:48.430
Okay, shh shh shh shh.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.932
I'm here. Hey, you look at me.
You stay with me.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.013
You hear me?
Shh shh shh. Okay.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.849
I'm right here, Rick.
Stay with me. You hear me?

12:54.023 --> 12:56.355
Shh shh. That's it. Do you hear me?
Shh shh shh. Okay.

12:56.525 --> 12:58.607
I'm right here with you.
Stay with me.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.643
- ( distant sirens )
- Shh shh. That's it. I'm right here.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.607
Leon over radio:
Dispatch, we have an officer down.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.397
Request paramedics,
please respond.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.406
Route 18 two miles west of l-85.

13:06.577 --> 13:08.693
Repeat, officer down.
Request immediate response.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.863
- ( ventilator hissing )
-( heart monitor beeping )

13:13.959 --> 13:15.790
( labored breathing )

13:15.961 --> 13:17.792
( distorted )
Hey, bud.

13:19.006 --> 13:20.587
We're still here.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.295
We're still hanging in.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.462
I'm sorry, man.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.132
I know I say the same crap
every time I come in here.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.301
(sighs)

13:35.314 --> 13:37.100
Everybody pitched in on these.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.526
They-- they wanted me
to bring 'em down.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.399
They send their love,
and they just--

13:41.570 --> 13:43.982
they hope you come back real soon.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.195
( chuckles )
Linda and Diane from dispatch,

13:49.370 --> 13:50.701
they picked these out.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.032
Probably could tell, huh?

13:55.835 --> 13:58.076
I'm just gonna set these
on your side table, okay?

14:02.925 --> 14:04.916
(silence)

14:07.763 --> 14:10.505
That vase--
that's something special.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.175
'Fess up. You steal that for me
at Grandma Jean's house?

14:14.353 --> 14:15.513
(laughing)

14:15.688 --> 14:17.974
I hope you left her
that spoon collection.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.684
(coughing)

14:26.115 --> 14:27.901
Shane?

14:31.537 --> 14:33.869
( rasps)
Shane, you in thejohn?

14:50.222 --> 14:52.213
( crackling )

15:20.377 --> 15:22.368
(grunting)

15:51.867 --> 15:53.698
Nurse, help.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.196
Nurse, help.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.299

18:10.172 --> 18:12.163
(door rattling )

18:30.526 --> 18:32.858
(thumping, moaning)

18:33.028 --> 18:35.019
( glass shatters )

18:38.200 --> 18:40.191
(groaning)

19:01.515 --> 19:03.676
(groaning louder)

19:19.825 --> 19:21.031
( Rick coughs)

19:29.585 --> 19:31.576
(coughing)

19:39.344 --> 19:41.300
Ah!

20:02.784 --> 20:03.990
Ah.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.124
Ah.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.297
( clangs )

20:23.472 --> 20:25.463
( bugs chittering )

20:53.961 --> 20:55.952
(flies buzzing )

22:42.944 --> 22:44.935

-( bugs chittering )

23:07.594 --> 23:09.585
(hissing)

23:10.847 --> 23:12.883
Ah. Ah. Oh shit.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.550
(growling)

23:46.591 --> 23:48.673
Lori.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.219
Lori!

24:00.105 --> 24:03.393
Carl. Carl!

24:06.278 --> 24:07.518
Shoot

24:09.406 --> 24:11.772
Lori! Carl!

24:17.956 --> 24:19.947
(sobbing )

24:26.256 --> 24:29.623
Lori! Carl.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.603
Is this real?

24:47.777 --> 24:49.768
Am I here?

24:56.328 --> 24:57.909
Wake-- wake up.

24:58.079 --> 25:00.070
( sniffles )

26:09.234 --> 26:10.690
( twig snaps )

26:12.779 --> 26:14.644
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Rick: Carl.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.940
Carl. I found you.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.825
Daddy, I got the sumbitch!
I'm gonna smack him dead!

26:27.919 --> 26:30.376
He say something?
I thought I heard him say something.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.913
- He called me Carl.
- Son, you know they don't talk.

26:33.091 --> 26:35.924
Hey, mister,
what's that bandage for?

26:36.094 --> 26:38.756
W-- what?

26:38.930 --> 26:41.091
What kind of wound?

26:41.266 --> 26:44.099
You answer me, damn you.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.225
What's your wound?

26:47.272 --> 26:48.933
You tell me...

26:49.107 --> 26:51.314
or I will kill you.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.691
( footsteps )

27:10.253 --> 27:12.244
( rubber gloves snap )

27:15.008 --> 27:17.124
Man: You got
that bandage changed now.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.838
It was pretty rank.

27:19.012 --> 27:22.220
What was the wound?

27:22.390 --> 27:25.757
- Gunshot.
- Gunshot?

27:26.811 --> 27:28.722
What else? Anything?

27:28.897 --> 27:31.559
Gunshot ain't enough?

27:33.318 --> 27:35.229
Look, | ask and you answer.

27:35.403 --> 27:37.894
That's common courtesy, right?

27:41.701 --> 27:44.568
( emphatically )
Did you get bit?

27:46.206 --> 27:47.992
- Bit?
- Bit, chewed,

27:48.166 --> 27:50.999
maybe scratched--
anything like that?

27:51.169 --> 27:53.160
No, I got shot.

27:54.422 --> 27:56.629
Just shot as far as I know.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.506
Hey. Just let me.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.049
Feels cool enough.

28:07.227 --> 28:10.014
Fever would've killed you by now.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.304
I don't think l have one.

28:12.482 --> 28:14.313
Be hard to miss.

28:20.198 --> 28:23.065
Take a moment,
look how sharp it is.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.575
You try anything,

28:25.745 --> 28:27.201
|wi|| kill you with it.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.579
And don't you think I won't.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.913
( rope snaps )

28:38.967 --> 28:40.298
( knife clicks )

28:40.468 --> 28:42.880
Man:
Come on out when you're able.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.718
Come on.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.685
( ladle scrapes )

29:18.089 --> 29:22.753
Rick: This place--
Fred and Cindy Drake's?

29:22.927 --> 29:24.883
Man:
Never met 'em.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.716
I've been here.
This is their place.

29:27.891 --> 29:30.257
Man:
It was empty when we got here.

29:33.354 --> 29:36.482
Don't do that.
They'll see the light.

29:36.649 --> 29:39.106
There's more of them
out there than usual.

29:39.277 --> 29:43.020
I never should've fired
that gun today.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.814
Sound draws them.
Now they're all over the street.

29:45.992 --> 29:49.610
Stupid-- using a gun.

29:50.705 --> 29:52.570
But it all happened so fast,

29:52.749 --> 29:54.285
Ididn't think.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.450
You shot that man today.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.040
- Man?
- Boy: lt weren't no man.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.954
What the hell was that
out of your mouth just now?

30:01.132 --> 30:03.339
It wasn't a man.

30:03.510 --> 30:06.126
You shot him in the street
out front-- a man.

30:06.304 --> 30:09.137
Friend, you need glasses.
It was a walker.

30:09.307 --> 30:12.174
Come on. Sit down

30:12.352 --> 30:14.593
before you fall down.

30:15.647 --> 30:16.887
Here.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.690
Daddy,

30:21.861 --> 30:23.522
blessing.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.813
Yeah.

30:38.753 --> 30:41.165
Lord, we thank Thee for this food,

30:41.339 --> 30:43.375
Thy blessings.

30:43.550 --> 30:46.633
And we ask You to watch over us
in these crazy days.

30:46.803 --> 30:48.213
- Amen.
- Boy: Amen.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.268
Hey, mister, you even know
what's going on?

30:57.438 --> 31:01.602
I woke up today in the hospital,

31:03.278 --> 31:05.519
came home
and that's all I know.

31:08.324 --> 31:10.576
But you know about
the dead people, right?

31:10.743 --> 31:13.029
Yeah, I saw a lot of that--

31:13.204 --> 31:15.695
out on the loading dock,
piled in trucks.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.365
No, not the ones they put down.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.909
The ones they didn't--
the walkers,

31:21.087 --> 31:23.874
like the one I shot today.

31:24.048 --> 31:25.584
'Cause he'd have ripped into you,

31:25.758 --> 31:28.215
tried to eat you,
taken some flesh at least.

31:28.386 --> 31:31.719
Well, I guess if this is
the first you're hearing it,

31:31.890 --> 31:34.552
I know how it must sound.

31:37.186 --> 31:39.177
They're out there now?
In the street?

31:39.355 --> 31:40.435
Yeah.

31:40.607 --> 31:43.189
They get more active
after dark sometimes.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.190
Maybe it's the cool air or--

31:45.361 --> 31:48.273
hell, maybe it'sjust
me firing that gun today.

31:48.448 --> 31:51.485
But we'll be fine
as long as we stay quiet.

31:51.659 --> 31:53.945
Probably wander off by morning.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.914
one thing I do know--

32:01.085 --> 32:02.996
don't you get bit.

32:03.171 --> 32:06.163
I saw your bandage
and that's what we were afraid of.

32:06.341 --> 32:08.798
Bites kill you.

32:08.968 --> 32:10.754
The fever burns you out.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.635
But then after a while...

32:14.390 --> 32:16.130
you come back.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.555
Seen it happen.

32:28.821 --> 32:30.812
Come on.

32:34.410 --> 32:36.401
( crickets chirping )

32:38.164 --> 32:41.782
Man:
Carl-- he your son?

32:42.835 --> 32:46.168
Well, you--
you said his name today.

32:47.423 --> 32:49.163
He's a little younger

32:49.342 --> 32:51.128
than your boy.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.917
Man:
And he's with his mother?

32:54.889 --> 32:56.504
I hope so.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.264
Boy: Dad.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.301
Hey.

33:01.479 --> 33:03.185
Did you ask him?

33:03.356 --> 33:05.096
( chuckles )

33:05.274 --> 33:07.265
Man:
Your gunshot--

33:07.443 --> 33:09.058
we've got a little bet going.

33:09.237 --> 33:12.149
My boy says
you're a bank robber.

33:12.323 --> 33:13.699
( chuckles )

33:13.866 --> 33:16.403
Yeah, that's me,

33:16.577 --> 33:18.659
the deadliest Dillinger. Kapow.

33:18.830 --> 33:22.163
- ( man chuckles)
- Sheriff's deputy.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.998
Uh-huh.

33:26.921 --> 33:28.127
( car alarm blaring )

33:28.297 --> 33:30.037
Hey, it's okay. Daddy's here.

33:30.216 --> 33:31.956
It's nothing.

33:32.135 --> 33:35.002
One of them must've
bumped a car.

33:35.179 --> 33:38.171
- Are you sure?
- It happened once before.

33:38.349 --> 33:41.341
It went on for a few minutes.

33:43.479 --> 33:45.015
Get the light, Duane.

33:45.189 --> 33:47.180
( alarm continues )

33:58.828 --> 34:01.114
It's the blue one on the street,

34:01.289 --> 34:03.245
the same one as last time.

34:03.416 --> 34:05.532
I think we're okay.

34:08.087 --> 34:11.750
That noise--
won't it bring more of them?

34:11.924 --> 34:14.711
Man:
Nothing we can do about it now.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.172
Just have to
wait 'em out till morning.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.591
( gasps )
She's here.

34:22.769 --> 34:26.136
Man: Don't look.
Get away from the windows.

34:28.191 --> 34:29.897
I said go. Go on.

34:33.571 --> 34:37.109
- ( sobbing )
- Duane. Duane, quiet now.

34:37.283 --> 34:39.239
Come on. Quiet now.

34:39.410 --> 34:42.902
Shh shh.

35:01.557 --> 35:03.843
It's okay. Here.

35:04.018 --> 35:06.600
Cry into the pillow.
Do you remember?

35:06.771 --> 35:08.887
Shh. Shh.

35:09.065 --> 35:11.727
( footsteps )

35:28.626 --> 35:30.332
(doorknob rattling )

35:46.853 --> 35:49.139
She, um--

35:50.398 --> 35:51.888
she died in that other room

35:52.066 --> 35:53.681
on that bed in there.

35:56.112 --> 35:58.945
There was nothing |--
I could do about it.

35:59.115 --> 36:01.401
That fever, man,

36:01.576 --> 36:05.114
her skin gave off
a heat like a furnace.

36:05.288 --> 36:07.279
(crying)

36:10.459 --> 36:11.835
lshould've--

36:12.003 --> 36:14.335
lshould've put her down, man.
I should've put her down.

36:14.505 --> 36:16.041
I know that, but |--

36:18.009 --> 36:21.001
you know what?
ljust didn't have it in me.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.807
She's the mother of my child.

36:29.812 --> 36:31.803
( rattling continues)

36:53.836 --> 36:55.701
Rick:
Are we sure they're dead?

36:55.880 --> 36:58.747
l have to ask
at least one more time.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.756
Man:
They dead,

37:00.927 --> 37:02.883
except for something in the brain.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.215
That's why
it's got to be the head.

37:10.394 --> 37:12.385
( hisses )

37:13.856 --> 37:15.847
(growling)

37:19.111 --> 37:21.568
(grunting)

37:30.081 --> 37:31.742
Man:
Y'all all right?

37:33.376 --> 37:35.742
I need a moment.

37:40.591 --> 37:43.048
They're alive--
my wife and son.

37:43.219 --> 37:45.050
At least they were
when they left.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.586
How can you know?

37:46.764 --> 37:48.595
By the look of this place--

37:48.766 --> 37:51.257
I found empty drawers
in the bedroom.

37:51.435 --> 37:52.766
They packed some clothes-- not a lot,

37:52.937 --> 37:54.928
but enough to travel.

37:55.106 --> 37:58.269
You know anybody could've broken in
here and stole them clothes, right?

37:58.442 --> 38:00.933
You see the framed photos
on the walls?

38:02.280 --> 38:03.565
Neither do |.

38:03.739 --> 38:05.604
Some random thief take
those too, you think?

38:09.870 --> 38:13.328
Our photo albums,
family pictures-- all gone.

38:14.500 --> 38:18.413
Photo albums.
( laughs )

38:22.133 --> 38:25.671
My wife-- same thing.

38:25.845 --> 38:27.881
There I am
packing survival gear,

38:28.055 --> 38:30.467
she's grabbing photo alb...

38:35.104 --> 38:37.436
They're in Atlanta, I bet.

38:37.606 --> 38:39.767
That's right.

38:39.942 --> 38:42.479
- Why there?
- Man: Refugee center.

38:42.653 --> 38:45.611
A huge one they said,
before the broadcast stopped.

38:45.781 --> 38:48.989
Military protection, food, shelter.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.025
They told people to go there,

38:51.203 --> 38:52.784
said it'd be safest.

38:52.955 --> 38:54.946
Duane:
Plus they got that disease place.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.910
The Center
for Disease Control

38:57.084 --> 39:00.042
said they were working out
how to solve this thing.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.173
( lock clicks)

39:23.194 --> 39:25.185
-( knob squeaks)
- ( pipes groan )

39:27.198 --> 39:29.814
Gas lines have been down
for maybe a month.

39:29.992 --> 39:32.529
The station's got
its own propane system.

39:35.122 --> 39:36.703
Pilot's still on.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.325
- Duane: Whoo-hoo!
- Man: Oh my Lord.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.540
- Hot water!
- Ah!

39:43.714 --> 39:45.579
That feels good, right?

39:45.758 --> 39:47.123
- ( laughs)
- J‘ Bring it around, bring it J‘

39:47.301 --> 39:48.916
J‘ Bring it, bring it,
bring it around, uh! J‘

39:49.095 --> 39:51.711
Yeah. I'm wet.
Take that. What?

39:51.889 --> 39:53.299
Whoo!

39:55.559 --> 39:58.926
Duane.
Dressing room back there.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.059
What do you say, Duane?

40:02.233 --> 40:03.973
Thank you.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.400
Man:
Mm-hmm.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.943
Rick:
Atlanta sounds like a good deal.

40:12.034 --> 40:14.366
Safer anyway-- people.

40:14.537 --> 40:16.573
Man:
That's where we were headed.

40:16.747 --> 40:18.738
Things got crazy.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.872
Man, you wouldn't
believe the panic.

40:21.043 --> 40:22.908
Streets weren't fit to be on.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.668
And then my--

40:26.215 --> 40:28.581
my wife couldn't travel--

40:28.759 --> 40:31.421
no, not with her hurt--
so we had to find a place to lay low.

40:31.595 --> 40:34.007
And then after she died,

40:36.934 --> 40:39.175
we just stayed hunkered down.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.471
I guess we just froze in place.

40:45.317 --> 40:47.273
Plan to move on?

40:50.573 --> 40:52.859
Haven't worked up to it yet.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.831
A lot of it's gone missing.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.371
Daddy, can I learn
to shoot?

41:05.546 --> 41:08.128
- I'm old enough.
- Hell yes, you're gonna learn,

41:08.299 --> 41:10.665
but we've got to do it carefully,
teach you to respect the weapon.

41:10.843 --> 41:12.834
That's right. It's not a toy.

41:13.012 --> 41:14.627
You pull the trigger,
you have to mean it.

41:14.805 --> 41:16.306
Always remember that, Duane.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.634
Yes sir.

41:19.852 --> 41:23.470
Man:
Here. Load up.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.102
You take that one.
Nothing fancy.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.271
The scope's accurate.

41:46.086 --> 41:47.917
Conserve your ammo.

41:48.088 --> 41:49.703
It goes faster than you think,

41:49.882 --> 41:51.622
especially at target practice.

41:53.010 --> 41:54.921
- Man: Duane.
- Uh-huh?

41:55.095 --> 41:56.676
- Take this to the car.
- Okay.

41:56.847 --> 41:58.838
Are you sure
you won't come along?

42:00.184 --> 42:03.142
A few more days.
By then Duane will know how to shoot

42:03.312 --> 42:04.973
and I won't be so rusty.

42:09.860 --> 42:11.236
(walkie-talkie clicks, whines )

42:11.403 --> 42:14.019
You've got one battery.

42:14.198 --> 42:16.530
I'll turn mine on a few minutes
every day at dawn.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.986
You get up there,
that's how you'll find me.

42:19.161 --> 42:22.324
- You think ahead.
- Can't afford not to,

42:22.498 --> 42:24.989
- not anymore.
- Man: Listen, one thing--

42:25.167 --> 42:27.874
they may not seem
like much one at a time,

42:28.045 --> 42:29.956
but in a group,
all riled up and hungry--

42:30.130 --> 42:33.042
- man, you watch your ass.
- You too.

42:35.719 --> 42:38.836
You're a good man, Rick.
I hope you find your wife and son.

42:41.642 --> 42:43.223
Be seeing you, Duane.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.430
- Take care of your old man.
- Yes sir.

42:45.604 --> 42:47.595
(zombie growling)

42:56.740 --> 42:58.901
Leon Basset?

43:02.746 --> 43:04.247
I didn't think much of him--

43:04.415 --> 43:06.747
careless and dumb-- but...

43:08.085 --> 43:09.825
I can't leave him like this.

43:11.046 --> 43:12.707
( growls )

43:12.881 --> 43:14.587
You know they'll hear the shot.

43:14.758 --> 43:17.090
Let's not be here

Come on, son, you know best
how to work this thing.

50:58.722 --> 51:01.304
Hello, hello. Is the person

51:18.241 --> 51:20.323
There are others.
It's notjust us.

51:20.494 --> 51:21.950
We knew there would be, right?

51:22.120 --> 51:23.451
That's why we left the CB on.

51:23.622 --> 51:25.112
A lot of good it's been doing.

51:25.290 --> 51:26.996
- Okay.
- Woman: And I've been saying for a week

51:27.167 --> 51:30.159
we ought to put signs up on 85
and warn people away from the city.

51:30.337 --> 51:32.293
Folks got no idea
what they're getting into.

51:32.464 --> 51:34.546
Well, we haven't had time.

51:35.926 --> 51:37.917
I think we need to make time.

51:38.095 --> 51:41.838
Yeah, that--
that's a luxury we can't afford.

51:42.015 --> 51:44.427
We are surviving here.
We are day to day.

51:45.602 --> 51:47.593
And who the hell would
you propose we send?

51:47.771 --> 51:49.432
I'll go. Give me a vehicle.

51:49.606 --> 51:51.597
Nobody goes anywhere alone.
You know that.

Yes sir.

Hey hey hey.
Go on, take a seat, bud.

52:00.700 --> 52:02.531
You're all right.
Go on. You're all right.

52:05.956 --> 52:07.662
What, are you pissed at me?

52:09.876 --> 52:12.959
You can be pissed at me all you want.
It's not gonna change anything.

52:15.006 --> 52:16.792
I'm not putting you
in danger, okay?

52:16.967 --> 52:18.582
I'm not doing it for anything.

52:18.760 --> 52:20.625
That make you feel like
sometimes you want

52:20.804 --> 52:22.669
to slap me upside the head--
tell you what, girl:

52:22.848 --> 52:26.011
you feel that need, you go right ahead.
I'm right here. Go on.

52:27.978 --> 52:30.811
You cannot walk off like that,

52:30.981 --> 52:32.892
all half-cocked.

52:33.066 --> 52:36.058
Look, you do not want to do it
for my sake or your sake, that's fine.

52:36.236 --> 52:39.353
Butjust-- you do it for him.

52:39.531 --> 52:42.068
That boy has been
through too much

52:42.242 --> 52:45.029
and he's not losing
his mother too, okay?

52:46.163 --> 52:47.653
Okay?

52:47.831 --> 52:49.662
I'm a good mom.

52:52.961 --> 52:54.997
You tell me "okay."

52:59.676 --> 53:01.917
Hmm?
(chucMes)

53:02.095 --> 53:03.835
It's not hard.

53:04.014 --> 53:07.552
All right? Hey.

53:21.740 --> 53:23.355
Boy: Mom?

53:26.995 --> 53:29.452
Shane: What's up, bud?
She's in there. Go on.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.950
Hey, I don't want you to worry.

53:34.127 --> 53:36.539
Your mama's not
going anywhere, okay?

53:36.713 --> 53:39.170
Yeah? Yeah?

53:39.341 --> 53:41.297
- Go finish your chores. Okay.
- Okay.

- Easy now. Easy.

56:42.065 --> 56:43.396
I'm not gonna hurt you.

56:43.566 --> 56:45.898
Nothing like that.

56:47.320 --> 56:49.732
More like a proposal.

56:51.074 --> 56:52.814
Atlanta's just down
the road a ways.

56:52.992 --> 56:56.530
It's safe there--
food, shelter, people.

56:56.704 --> 56:58.786
Other horses too, I bet.

57:00.959 --> 57:02.915
How's that sound?

57:03.086 --> 57:05.247
( softly )
There we go. Good boy.

57:05.422 --> 57:08.380

Good boy.

57:22.439 --> 57:23.929
Just go easy, okay?

57:24.107 --> 57:26.644
I haven't done this for years.

57:27.819 --> 57:30.606

Okay. Whoa whoa whoa.
