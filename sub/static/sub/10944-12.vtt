00:00.317 --> 00:01.517
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:01.552 --> 00:02.518
I can't ask you to put yourself

00:02.553 --> 00:04.320
on the line for me.

00:04.354 --> 00:05.488
I wanna help.

00:05.522 --> 00:07.122
Just wait here, and I'll get Phoenix.

00:08.424 --> 00:09.725
Come on, get up!

00:09.759 --> 00:11.560
This horse has some spirit!

00:11.595 --> 00:13.295
Jeremy, get off that horse!

00:13.329 --> 00:16.465
It's just he's
always there, and I'm always here.

00:16.499 --> 00:18.901
And I need him to put our family first,

00:18.935 --> 00:21.470
and stop bolting every time
I need him most.

00:21.504 --> 00:22.837
You're not thinking of...

00:22.905 --> 00:25.406
No, I don't have feelings for Lou!

00:25.440 --> 00:26.407
It's getting harder
and harder to ignore

00:26.441 --> 00:27.709
the way you treat her.

00:27.743 --> 00:29.611
I don't see how this is
any of your business, so...

00:29.645 --> 00:30.979
Oh!

00:31.013 --> 00:32.445
- Caleb!
- What was that?!

00:32.514 --> 00:34.315
I don't know!
Look, just...

00:34.349 --> 00:35.750
I'll deal with him later.
Let's go.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.519 --> 01:49.586
Awesome!

01:54.825 --> 01:56.426
You wouldn't happen to know

01:56.494 --> 01:58.527
where our so-called
hired hand is,

01:58.595 --> 01:59.895
would you?

02:00.763 --> 02:02.298
Are you talking about Caleb?

02:02.332 --> 02:03.465
Yeah.

02:03.533 --> 02:05.201
He hasn't shown up for work
for a few days now,

02:05.268 --> 02:07.736
and I need his help with the grass.

02:07.770 --> 02:09.770
He's still working here?

02:09.839 --> 02:12.575
Hmm...
Why wouldn't he be?

02:13.743 --> 02:15.276
No, uh... no reason.

02:15.311 --> 02:16.511
I-I don't know.
Just you know,

02:16.545 --> 02:18.313
you know these guys,
busy rodeo schedule, right?

02:18.347 --> 02:20.348
Always somewhere else
when you need 'em most.

02:23.652 --> 02:26.787
You wouldn't know anything
about lawn care?

02:31.960 --> 02:34.095
I can't believe you didn't tell him!

02:34.162 --> 02:35.763
Grampa has enough on his mind

02:35.831 --> 02:37.898
without knowing about Caleb.

02:38.867 --> 02:39.867
Yeah, well he's going
to find out soon enough

02:39.935 --> 02:43.268
when somebody fires that cowboy.

02:43.504 --> 02:44.905
I'll do it myself.
I'll do it right now.

02:44.973 --> 02:46.806
No, no!
Peter, listen.

02:46.841 --> 02:47.962
I know I've been avoiding it,

02:47.975 --> 02:50.810
but I promise I will talk to him, okay?

02:50.845 --> 02:52.846
Great! Sounds good.
Here.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.748
Use my phone, do it right now.

02:54.782 --> 02:56.143
I'm not gonna do it over the phone!

02:56.150 --> 02:58.118
Peter, he's worked here for years.

02:58.152 --> 03:01.485
<i>I owe it to him to at least</i>
<i>to tell him in person.</i>

03:07.227 --> 03:09.061
That was so cool!

03:09.996 --> 03:11.864
Yeah, this guy really loves to jump.

03:11.898 --> 03:12.931
You know what, I'm gonna go get Phoenix

03:12.966 --> 03:13.999
and do the same thing!

03:14.033 --> 03:15.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute now!

03:15.735 --> 03:17.335
What's the rush?
Don't you have chores to do?

03:17.370 --> 03:19.336
Yeah, but I don't have time!

03:19.371 --> 03:21.305
I have to go get ready
for the show next weekend.

03:21.339 --> 03:22.573
What show?

03:22.607 --> 03:23.841
Hillhurst Stables.

03:23.876 --> 03:25.810
All the horsey girls
from my class are going.

03:30.382 --> 03:31.448
Hey.

03:37.789 --> 03:40.090
So what will it be, a cup of coffee?

03:40.124 --> 03:41.591
Piece of pie?

03:41.625 --> 03:43.393
Actually, neither.

03:43.427 --> 03:45.028
How about the special of the day?

03:45.096 --> 03:46.763
Grilled chicken on a crispy
sourdough bun?

03:46.798 --> 03:48.331
No, thanks.

03:48.365 --> 03:50.333
I just, I wanted to talk
to you, Mallory.

03:50.401 --> 03:54.003
Uh, I got your message about
rescheduling tomorrow's lesson.

03:54.037 --> 03:57.239
Yeah. As you can see
my hands are kinda full -

03:57.307 --> 03:58.607
School, work...

03:58.641 --> 04:00.176
You've already skipped
two sessions this week,

04:00.243 --> 04:02.644
and at this rate you'll have
to forget about Hillhurst.

04:02.679 --> 04:04.079
Hillhurst?

04:05.315 --> 04:07.648
Oh, I just thought, you know,

04:07.716 --> 04:10.218
after Amy changed her mind on Phoenix,

04:10.286 --> 04:11.686
you wouldn't wanna coach me anymore.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.188
As far as I'm concerned,

04:13.255 --> 04:14.823
like the whole thing was just...

04:14.890 --> 04:17.125
an unfortunate misunderstanding.

04:17.159 --> 04:18.358
Okay.

04:18.427 --> 04:20.295
I mean your riding is
really getting better.

04:20.362 --> 04:21.595
And I think Hillhurst would be perfect

04:21.663 --> 04:23.931
for your first competition.

04:23.998 --> 04:25.833
Do you really think
I'll be ready in time?

04:25.900 --> 04:28.001
Well, you've got a great coach,

04:28.069 --> 04:30.403
and if we get a couple of sessions in,

04:30.471 --> 04:32.372
yeah, no doubt about it.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.807
But there is one little problem.

04:33.875 --> 04:36.776
Unless we trailer your horse
over to Hillhurst,

04:36.845 --> 04:38.712
we'll have to do it at Heartland.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.246
And I haven't talked to Amy,

04:40.314 --> 04:42.949
so I don't know if I'm still welcome.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.888
Hello?
Is anybody home?

04:50.924 --> 04:52.792
- Hey, Lou.
- Hey, Ty.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.094
Um, I was just looking for Caleb.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.495
<i>Is he around?</i>

04:56.563 --> 04:58.063
Uh... No,
he went into town.

04:58.130 --> 04:59.297
I let him borrow my truck.

04:59.366 --> 05:00.932
He's gotta get a new alternator, so...

05:01.000 --> 05:02.501
What's up?

05:02.569 --> 05:04.609
Oh, nothing, I just-
I really need to talk to Caleb.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.705
Thanks, though.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.140
Hey, you know, actually, did um...

05:09.208 --> 05:12.142
Did Caleb say anything to you
about me or Peter?

05:13.111 --> 05:15.112
Uh no, not really.

05:15.146 --> 05:16.313
Why?

05:16.348 --> 05:17.815
Uh, because...

05:17.883 --> 05:19.250
It's kind of personal.

05:19.317 --> 05:22.019
Do you mind if we keep it
just between me and you?

05:22.053 --> 05:23.954
Uh... yeah,
I guess.

05:23.989 --> 05:25.757
Great. Okay.

05:25.824 --> 05:28.825
Last weekend, me and Peter
had this disagreement,

05:28.860 --> 05:31.428
and then Caleb did this
really stupid thing, and now-

05:31.462 --> 05:33.597
Whoa! What stupid thing?

05:33.631 --> 05:35.965
- What'd he do?
- Mm, yeah. He sort of...

05:36.000 --> 05:38.668
kind of...
punched Peter a little.

05:38.703 --> 05:40.103
Punched him?!

05:40.137 --> 05:42.372
- Are you kidding me?
- Ty, it's not funny!

05:42.440 --> 05:44.239
Peter is really bent
out of shape about this,

05:44.274 --> 05:46.675
and I promised him
I would deal with it.

05:46.743 --> 05:48.377
But I was just thinking,

05:48.445 --> 05:51.480
I mean, maybe it'd be better
if you talked to Caleb.

05:51.548 --> 05:53.616
Uh... yeah,
I could talk to him.

05:53.650 --> 05:55.451
What do you want me to say?

05:57.521 --> 05:59.154
What happened to all the jumps?

06:00.756 --> 06:01.956
Well, you're not ready for the height

06:01.990 --> 06:04.426
that I was jumping Spartan at.

06:04.460 --> 06:07.629
Well, I have to jump
high if I want to win anything!

06:07.663 --> 06:09.263
Maybe some day.

06:09.331 --> 06:11.800
But how about we start small,
and work our way up?

06:11.834 --> 06:14.469
And how fast can we work our way up?

06:14.503 --> 06:16.069
You have to be patient, Georgie.

06:16.103 --> 06:18.138
Doing these things right
takes some time.

06:18.172 --> 06:20.741
What do you mean by
doing things right?!

06:20.775 --> 06:22.910
Okay, how about we just go over these,

06:22.944 --> 06:23.844
and we'll see what you can do?

06:23.878 --> 06:24.878
Okay. Fine.

06:35.689 --> 06:36.823
Woo-hoo!

06:36.857 --> 06:37.924
Good!

06:39.693 --> 06:41.894
Good job!
That was nice.

06:43.596 --> 06:45.965
Watch this!

06:45.999 --> 06:47.899
Georgie? Georgie!

06:47.934 --> 06:49.501
<i>Georgie, no!</i>

06:58.711 --> 07:00.211
See? I told you
I can go higher

07:00.245 --> 07:02.647
than those stupid little jumps!

07:02.715 --> 07:04.036
Yes, you can...

07:04.850 --> 07:07.384
But if you ever pull
another stunt like that,

07:07.418 --> 07:09.653
you're not riding that horse
ever again!

07:53.294 --> 07:55.462
This isn't fair!
You can't stop me!

07:55.531 --> 07:57.031
Yes I can!

07:57.098 --> 07:58.432
That was a solid fence, Georgie.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.934
If Phoenix had've hit it,
you would've both gone down.

08:00.002 --> 08:02.269
You have to let me
enter the show! Please!

08:02.337 --> 08:05.272
You are not ready
for a schooling show, okay?

08:05.306 --> 08:06.774
You barely made it over that jump!

08:06.808 --> 08:09.042
You need to practice
your position over the fences.

08:09.076 --> 08:10.944
Well, Phoenix can jump over anything!

08:11.012 --> 08:12.078
Well, maybe.

08:12.146 --> 08:13.279
But you can't!

08:13.313 --> 08:15.682
Riding like that
can get you seriously hurt!

08:16.918 --> 08:18.718
Just give me some lessons.

08:18.786 --> 08:21.087
I promise I'll do it right!

08:21.155 --> 08:23.122
There just isn't enough time, okay?

08:23.157 --> 08:24.189
Look at Mallory.

08:24.257 --> 08:25.558
She's been working at this for months,

08:25.592 --> 08:26.992
and she's just starting to get it now.

08:27.027 --> 08:28.260
I don't care about Mallory!

08:28.327 --> 08:30.062
I don't wanna ride like her!

08:30.096 --> 08:31.829
I wanna ride like you!

08:38.037 --> 08:39.437
But I told the kids at school!

08:39.471 --> 08:41.438
If I don't go,
they're gonna think I'm a liar!

08:41.506 --> 08:43.041
Look, I'm sorry, but Amy
would have to coach you.

08:43.075 --> 08:45.309
So if she says no,
then I have to say no too.

08:45.377 --> 08:46.644
Jack!

08:46.679 --> 08:48.912
No! Whatever it is,
if Lou says no,

08:48.980 --> 08:50.280
then I say no too.

08:50.314 --> 08:52.449
- Gaaaaah!
- Georgie!

08:52.483 --> 08:54.651
She really wants to enter
this horse show.

08:54.686 --> 08:56.166
I should go and explain things to her.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.187
What part of "no"

08:57.254 --> 08:58.956
do you think she doesn't understand?

08:58.990 --> 09:00.891
She heard what you said.

09:04.327 --> 09:07.660
Yes, I punched him,
but I had my reasons.

09:07.698 --> 09:09.331
Well, I hope they were good ones.

09:09.365 --> 09:10.532
Because you can't expect
to keep your job

09:10.601 --> 09:13.402
if you go around punching people.

09:13.436 --> 09:14.403
Nah, I've been working there for years,

09:14.471 --> 09:16.072
I'm like a permanent fixture.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.674
Well, you might not be
as permanent as you think.

09:18.709 --> 09:20.408
If something doesn't change
Peter's mind,

09:20.442 --> 09:22.077
Lou might not have a choice.

09:22.111 --> 09:23.678
No way! I mean...

09:23.713 --> 09:26.081
Come on, she's at home 24-7
taking care of business,

09:26.115 --> 09:29.350
and she's gonna let that guy
call the shots?

09:29.384 --> 09:30.652
"That guy?"

09:30.686 --> 09:32.621
You mean, her husband?
The father of her child?

09:32.655 --> 09:35.023
The guy you punched in the face?

09:35.057 --> 09:38.558
Admittedly, when you put it like that
it doesn't sound too good.

09:38.593 --> 09:41.926
Look, I don't think Lou
wants to fire you, okay?

09:42.964 --> 09:44.098
I don't even think
Jack knows about this.

09:44.132 --> 09:45.198
So all you gotta do

09:45.233 --> 09:46.266
is set things straight with Peter,

09:46.334 --> 09:48.468
and you'll probably have
a good chance of keeping your job.

09:48.503 --> 09:50.004
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

09:50.038 --> 09:53.039
And I'll go over there
I swear, I just...

09:53.073 --> 09:55.341
I gotta get this alternator
working first.

09:55.375 --> 09:57.576
You can borrow my truck
and go right now.

09:57.611 --> 10:00.346
Thanks, but I think I'll wait.

10:02.315 --> 10:03.282
Hey, Mallory.

10:03.316 --> 10:04.383
Hey!

10:05.318 --> 10:06.519
What's going on?

10:06.553 --> 10:08.253
Nothing.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.122
I just wanted...

10:11.057 --> 10:13.025
Could I ask you for a favour?

10:13.059 --> 10:14.126
Sure.

10:15.461 --> 10:17.129
Well you see, um...

10:17.196 --> 10:19.564
I'm entering this riding
competition next weekend.

10:19.632 --> 10:21.133
What, at Hillhurst?

10:21.167 --> 10:22.834
Yeah.

10:22.869 --> 10:24.869
And if I'm gonna be ready,

10:24.936 --> 10:27.705
I'm gonna need some coaching.

10:27.773 --> 10:29.541
Well, I am pretty busy,

10:29.575 --> 10:32.343
but I can always
make time to coach you.

10:32.411 --> 10:35.180
I'd ask you, but...
Jeremy asked first,

10:35.247 --> 10:37.048
and he's been really positive
and encouraging

10:37.082 --> 10:38.449
about me entering and everything.

10:38.484 --> 10:41.351
He even gave me a discount on his fee.

10:42.287 --> 10:45.056
So you want Jeremy to coach you?

10:46.058 --> 10:47.992
Yeah.

10:48.060 --> 10:50.627
Well, except he feels really bad

10:50.696 --> 10:52.863
about everything that's happened,

10:52.898 --> 10:56.231
and I was just wondering
if you're still mad at him?

10:58.869 --> 11:01.004
Jeremy wants to coach
Mallory at Heartland?

11:01.038 --> 11:02.172
Are you kidding?!

11:02.239 --> 11:05.108
No, that's what she told me.

11:06.577 --> 11:09.245
Well, you told her
there was no way, right?

11:09.313 --> 11:12.348
Um, not exactly.

11:13.583 --> 11:14.649
Amy!

11:14.718 --> 11:16.185
She had her heart set on it.

11:16.219 --> 11:18.553
She was so happy and excited!

11:20.890 --> 11:22.424
I know he acted like a jerk

11:22.491 --> 11:24.960
when I changed my mind about Phoenix.

11:25.028 --> 11:26.161
But with everything that's
going on with his horse,

11:26.229 --> 11:27.662
who can blame him?

11:27.731 --> 11:29.764
I can!
I can blame the guy.

11:29.832 --> 11:32.100
I don't like him, I don't trust him.

11:32.134 --> 11:33.801
<i>And I can't believe you want</i>
<i>to have anything to do with him</i>

11:33.836 --> 11:35.770
after everything that's just happened.

11:35.838 --> 11:39.171
You're right.
Yeah, I...

11:39.641 --> 11:42.243
I don't really like the guy either.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.712
But Mallory has her heart set on it!

11:44.779 --> 11:47.114
How can I take that away from her?

11:47.181 --> 11:48.949
Well, it's your decision.

11:49.016 --> 11:51.317
<i>I'm not gonna tell you what to do.</i>

11:51.385 --> 11:52.352
<i>But I am done with the guy,</i>

11:52.419 --> 11:55.155
so if he makes one wrong move...

12:00.394 --> 12:03.528
Most people, they only plant
and aerate in the spring.

12:03.563 --> 12:05.030
Mm-hmm!

12:05.065 --> 12:08.398
But the secret to a great lawn
is doing it in the fall too.

12:10.904 --> 12:12.504
I'm more than happy to help, Jack.

12:12.572 --> 12:14.140
Yeah, I appreciate it.

12:15.842 --> 12:17.341
It's funny though,

12:17.409 --> 12:20.742
Caleb still not showing up for work.

12:20.813 --> 12:23.748
Yeah, maybe he had
something better to do.

12:23.816 --> 12:26.751
Is there something you wanna tell me?

12:26.819 --> 12:28.619
Nope! Nothing to tell.

12:35.459 --> 12:37.740
Okay, let's just get something
straight right off the top.

12:39.264 --> 12:42.499
I completely understand
about Georgie and Phoenix.

12:42.533 --> 12:43.867
And if I had known the situation,

12:43.902 --> 12:46.270
I would have never even asked.

12:46.304 --> 12:48.205
It was my fault too.

12:48.239 --> 12:50.406
I got your hopes up about
being able to ride Phoenix.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.541
Let's just forget about it, Amy.

12:52.575 --> 12:55.908
That stuff that I said,
that was not me.

12:56.079 --> 12:59.148
I was just upset about
retiring Buckingham.

12:59.183 --> 13:01.617
But it won't happen again, and...

13:01.651 --> 13:02.772
I've made other arrangements,

13:02.786 --> 13:06.119
and everything's gonna be fine.

13:06.555 --> 13:07.655
Okay.

13:07.690 --> 13:09.024
Great.

13:09.959 --> 13:12.861
So clean slate?
Let bygones be bygones?

13:15.664 --> 13:16.932
Okay, sure.

13:16.966 --> 13:18.133
Great.

13:18.201 --> 13:20.601
Yeah, 'cause what's important
here is Mallory.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.703
She really wants this.

13:25.340 --> 13:26.974
All right.

13:27.008 --> 13:28.475
Oh, and uh... Amy,

13:28.509 --> 13:30.610
if you ever do want to sell Phoenix,

13:30.645 --> 13:33.547
I'd gladly take him off your hands.

13:34.515 --> 13:36.183
Okay. Fine.

13:38.452 --> 13:40.286
I have to warn you I'm a bit rusty,

13:40.354 --> 13:42.421
so don't get your hopes up.

13:42.456 --> 13:43.522
Okay.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.025
Well, I'll give you a tip, okay?

13:46.060 --> 13:47.660
A confidence booster.

13:47.694 --> 13:48.828
See, most riders,

13:48.896 --> 13:50.096
they like to count
their horse's strides

13:50.130 --> 13:51.831
so they know when to take off.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.766
But I use a secret mantra.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.302
Is that the secret to your success?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.071
Well, I learned early on

13:59.138 --> 14:00.638
that no matter what level you're at,

14:00.673 --> 14:01.806
you'll always end up against someone

14:01.841 --> 14:04.243
with a better horse, or better skills,

14:04.277 --> 14:06.178
or a better bank account.

14:06.212 --> 14:08.446
And that's why you need
something that's all your own,

14:08.514 --> 14:10.715
that no one can take away from you.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.084
And that's when the mantra comes in.

14:13.151 --> 14:16.388
Okay, so...
What's your mantra?

14:16.455 --> 14:19.424
Like I said, it's a secret.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.192
<i>But maybe someday i'll tell you,</i>

14:21.260 --> 14:23.961
if you promise not to tell anyone.

14:27.098 --> 14:30.367
<i>Okay, so I just have
to put in this order.</i>

14:30.435 --> 14:32.569
Uh, why don't you buy
yourself something

14:32.637 --> 14:34.070
while you're waiting for me?

14:34.105 --> 14:35.972
Okay, how about a smoothie?

14:36.007 --> 14:37.808
Ooh, perfect!
Get me one too, okay?

14:37.876 --> 14:39.743
Saskatoon berry.

14:45.382 --> 14:47.016
Oh look, there she is.

14:47.984 --> 14:49.385
Wimp alert!

14:49.453 --> 14:51.353
And what is that supposed to mean?!

14:51.422 --> 14:53.589
It means that after all your tough talk

14:53.624 --> 14:55.157
about beating me at Hillhurst,

14:55.225 --> 14:56.492
I checked the entries,

14:56.560 --> 14:59.893
and I didn't see your name...
anywhere.

14:59.995 --> 15:01.630
And what do you care if I enter?

15:01.697 --> 15:03.064
Are you scared?

15:03.132 --> 15:04.900
Scared? Of you?

15:04.934 --> 15:06.835
Don't make me laugh!

15:06.903 --> 15:10.038
Why would I be scared
of some pathetic foster kid

15:10.105 --> 15:12.106
who obviously doesn't even
have a horse,

15:12.174 --> 15:14.041
much less a jumper?

15:14.108 --> 15:16.343
I do so have a horse,
and I bet a million bucks

15:16.377 --> 15:18.178
it's way better than your little pony!

15:18.246 --> 15:19.379
Yeah right!

15:19.414 --> 15:21.549
Like a loser like you even knows
someone who has a million bucks!

15:21.616 --> 15:23.851
- Hey!
- Hey, Georgie.

15:23.885 --> 15:25.586
You haven't introduced me
to your friends.

15:25.654 --> 15:27.588
What's your name?

15:27.656 --> 15:28.923
Olivia.

15:28.957 --> 15:32.290
Well, Olivia, back off!

15:32.793 --> 15:34.894
You, come with me.

15:34.929 --> 15:36.329
Bye, Georgie!

15:37.264 --> 15:40.467
What are you doing?
Stop! Let go!

15:40.501 --> 15:41.701
What about my smoothie?

15:41.735 --> 15:43.503
Forget about the damn smoothie, okay?

15:43.537 --> 15:45.504
We have bigger fish to fry.

15:45.538 --> 15:47.138
What is that supposed to mean?

15:47.173 --> 15:48.206
Am I in trouble?

15:48.274 --> 15:49.508
You're not in trouble, okay?

15:49.542 --> 15:52.444
But that spoiled little brat
in there is!

15:52.479 --> 15:54.412
Now somebody has got to kick her butt

15:54.447 --> 15:56.114
at that horse show,

15:56.148 --> 15:58.650
and that somebody is going to be you!

15:58.685 --> 16:00.552
Okay?
Now, come on.

16:03.542 --> 16:05.679
Forget it, Lou.
I already told Georgie no.

16:05.680 --> 16:08.316
I know, and I backed
you up on that, Amy, I did.

16:08.350 --> 16:10.950
But you should've seen the way
that little girl was talking to Georgie!

16:11.453 --> 16:13.653
Like she was something stuck
on the bottom of her shoe!

16:13.687 --> 16:15.255
Yeah well, knocking down rails

16:15.289 --> 16:18.224
and falling off horses
isn't gonna change that.

16:18.259 --> 16:19.992
Don't you remember your first show?

16:20.026 --> 16:21.093
At Willowdale?
Yes!

16:21.128 --> 16:23.129
Because it was a total disaster.

16:23.163 --> 16:24.464
Yeah, and Mom knew

16:24.498 --> 16:25.898
that you were seriously overreaching,

16:25.932 --> 16:28.434
but she let you enter anyway.

16:28.469 --> 16:30.769
And you learned a valuable lesson.

16:30.803 --> 16:32.871
What, that don't enter
before you're ready

16:32.905 --> 16:34.373
or you'll totally suck?

16:34.407 --> 16:37.075
No, not that lesson.
The other lesson.

16:37.109 --> 16:39.210
The one about how,
after that first show,

16:39.279 --> 16:41.045
you trained hard every day

16:41.080 --> 16:43.782
so that you could win a ribbon
your next time out.

16:43.849 --> 16:45.683
And I did win.

16:45.717 --> 16:48.051
I beat Ashley,
and I remember her crying.

16:48.086 --> 16:50.053
It was probably
the happiest day of my life.

16:50.121 --> 16:52.390
I remember that day.

16:55.126 --> 16:57.995
Okay, okay, you're right.

16:58.062 --> 17:00.030
I'll give Georgie another chance.

17:00.064 --> 17:01.699
But she's gonna do things my way.

17:01.733 --> 17:03.033
Deal.

17:05.770 --> 17:08.204
What are we gonna jump first?

17:08.239 --> 17:09.705
Well, nothing.

17:09.773 --> 17:10.773
We're gonna focus on your position

17:10.809 --> 17:12.209
over the fence first.

17:12.277 --> 17:13.542
What fence?

17:13.577 --> 17:15.212
Georgie, if you're gonna do this,

17:15.246 --> 17:17.579
you've gotta learn
the basics first, okay?

17:17.615 --> 17:18.848
Okay, I guess.

17:19.983 --> 17:22.050
How about you stand up
in your stirrups,

17:22.118 --> 17:24.220
now put your weight
in your heels, good.

17:24.288 --> 17:25.821
Now, sit back down.
How does that feel?

17:25.888 --> 17:28.191
Like I've got a stick up my butt.

17:28.224 --> 17:29.225
<i>Can we do something now?</i>

17:29.259 --> 17:30.759
<i>We are doing something.</i>

17:30.794 --> 17:32.561
We're learning balance, all right?

17:32.629 --> 17:33.696
So that when you go over the jump

17:33.730 --> 17:35.051
you're not gonna fall back on him,

17:35.064 --> 17:36.298
or land on his neck.

17:36.332 --> 17:38.733
You want him to jump up to you, okay?

17:38.767 --> 17:40.401
Okay, I got it.
Let's go!

17:40.436 --> 17:42.403
No, we're not going anywhere yet, okay?

17:42.471 --> 17:43.939
We've gotta get this right.

17:44.006 --> 17:45.207
So let's talk about your elbows.

17:45.241 --> 17:46.708
Wait!

17:46.775 --> 17:48.176
<i>First, you're gonna tell me how to sit,</i>

17:48.244 --> 17:50.277
and now you wanna talk
about my elbows?!

17:53.581 --> 17:55.115
Way to take the fun out of it!

17:55.183 --> 17:56.217
Georgie...

18:00.322 --> 18:01.555
Hey, Ty.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.123
Hey!

18:03.191 --> 18:04.925
How's school going?

18:04.993 --> 18:06.492
Oh, pretty good.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.828
We got to dissect a goat today.

18:08.863 --> 18:10.063
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:10.130 --> 18:13.463
Wow. Um, did you talk
to Caleb?

18:14.668 --> 18:15.634
Yeah.

18:15.702 --> 18:17.270
What'd he say?
What's he gonna do?

18:17.304 --> 18:19.805
That's the problem, Lou,
he's not gonna do anything.

18:19.874 --> 18:20.840
What do you mean?

18:20.875 --> 18:22.007
Didn't you tell him about Peter?

18:22.041 --> 18:23.976
Yeah, but it didn't work.

18:24.043 --> 18:25.010
I'm just the messenger,

18:25.044 --> 18:26.378
he's not gonna take me seriously.

18:26.412 --> 18:28.247
You might have to deal
with this yourself.

18:28.281 --> 18:29.814
<i>We're all set in here.</i>

18:29.883 --> 18:30.949
Okay.

18:32.151 --> 18:33.585
Everything okay?

18:33.619 --> 18:36.488
Yeah, Ty was just telling me
about vet school.

18:39.157 --> 18:42.490
Some people swear by manure,
but I'm a mulch man myself.

18:42.928 --> 18:43.995
Oh, my dad too.

18:44.062 --> 18:45.363
He always said...

18:46.231 --> 18:47.698
"Why waste your money
when all the compost you need

18:47.732 --> 18:49.500
is just sitting there
for free, right?"

18:49.534 --> 18:51.602
Well, the important thing
is, you can't let it build up.

18:51.636 --> 18:53.570
You've gotta keep the thatch thin,

18:53.605 --> 18:55.038
<i>half an inch at most.</i>

18:55.072 --> 18:56.239
Gee, you guys,

18:56.274 --> 18:57.207
this is really fascinating
for all of us,

18:57.275 --> 18:58.809
but um...

18:58.843 --> 19:01.745
Amy, Georgie, how did it go today?

19:01.780 --> 19:03.447
She taught me how to sit up straight.

19:03.481 --> 19:05.401
Like I haven't heard that
a million times before.

19:06.651 --> 19:08.351
<i>I had a great lesson.</i>

19:08.386 --> 19:10.753
Jeremy told me I need a mantra.

19:10.788 --> 19:12.655
And I'm kind of caught between...

19:12.689 --> 19:14.857
"Reach for the sky, or don't even try,"

19:14.892 --> 19:17.359
or, "Face your fears."

19:17.394 --> 19:18.861
What're you talking about?

19:18.896 --> 19:20.530
<i>Sports mantras, Grampa.</i>

19:20.564 --> 19:21.724
You know,
"Swing like a king;"

19:21.732 --> 19:23.566
"Keep your eye on the prize;"

19:23.600 --> 19:25.301
Positive visualization.

19:25.335 --> 19:27.803
Something to remind you
what you're trying to achieve.

19:27.837 --> 19:29.037
<i>Right, Amy?</i>

19:29.104 --> 19:30.171
We get the same motivational stuff

19:30.205 --> 19:32.106
in management seminars all the time.

19:32.141 --> 19:34.810
How about...
"You're going down?"

19:34.844 --> 19:36.778
How about,
"No pain, no gain?!"

19:36.813 --> 19:38.112
I got one too.

19:38.147 --> 19:39.848
"You can't win it
if you ain't in it."

19:39.882 --> 19:42.817
How about...
Enough is enough!

19:50.158 --> 19:53.026
So what was up with Georgie tonight?

19:53.061 --> 19:54.995
There's a schooling show at Hillhurst.

19:55.029 --> 19:58.362
She's mad 'cause I won't let her enter.

19:58.466 --> 19:59.732
Well, how come?

19:59.800 --> 20:01.835
She's basically fearless;
She'll do okay.

20:01.869 --> 20:03.503
But that's not how it works!

20:03.537 --> 20:05.204
She doesn't know how to ride
like a show jumper.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.840
I've been trying to coach her,

20:06.874 --> 20:10.207
but all I've got so far
has been attitude.

20:10.444 --> 20:12.479
Well, it's just a local show, right?

20:12.546 --> 20:13.746
Why don't you just let her do it?

20:13.781 --> 20:15.213
Well...

20:15.247 --> 20:16.648
She's gotta learn how to ride properly

20:16.683 --> 20:19.317
if she's gonna win at all.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.520
Who said anything about winning?

20:21.554 --> 20:23.655
You're starting to sound like your dad.

20:23.690 --> 20:27.023
Actually, I think I sound
more like my mom.

20:28.495 --> 20:29.728
I thought your mom was a more sensitive

20:29.762 --> 20:31.261
horse whispery type.

20:31.329 --> 20:32.897
Well...

20:32.965 --> 20:36.298
She was, but she was also
super competitive,

20:36.668 --> 20:38.736
and she always loved a good challenge.

20:38.804 --> 20:41.572
Well, maybe that's your problem.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.640
You're looking at Georgie

20:42.674 --> 20:44.274
like she's your next big challenge.

20:44.342 --> 20:47.443
When you should be thinking,
how can you challenge her?

20:47.478 --> 20:48.478
You know, not controlling her,

20:48.546 --> 20:51.879
but letting her use what she's got.

20:52.483 --> 20:53.917
I know what you're thinking.

20:53.985 --> 20:54.985
I doubt it.

20:55.052 --> 20:56.319
You are thinking,

20:56.387 --> 20:58.755
how did I get so smart
and insightful...

20:58.789 --> 21:01.024
Uh-huh. Actually,
I was thinking...

21:07.330 --> 21:10.599
Wow! You're actually
gonna let me jump something.

21:10.667 --> 21:13.903
Yeah. You think you can
handle this combination?

21:13.970 --> 21:15.604
No problem.

21:15.639 --> 21:17.272
All right, no problem.

21:17.340 --> 21:19.340
Well, we wouldn't wanna
make this too easy,

21:19.408 --> 21:22.376
so how about...
We challenge you a little?

21:22.444 --> 21:24.546
To say, maybe here?

21:25.814 --> 21:28.016
Yeah sure,
I-I guess.

21:31.119 --> 21:32.987
All right, now remember,

21:33.022 --> 21:35.288
keep your heels down,
and you just hang onto his mane.

21:35.356 --> 21:37.591
Don't worry about your striding;
Let him jump up to you.

21:37.659 --> 21:38.592
Okay, I got it.

21:44.265 --> 21:46.399
<i>Remember your balance.</i>

21:47.835 --> 21:49.870
<i>Beautiful, okay!</i>

21:49.938 --> 21:51.437
<i>Look at that!</i>

21:53.574 --> 21:55.174
How was that?

21:55.241 --> 21:57.043
That was really good.

21:57.077 --> 21:59.311
Good enough for Hillhurst?

22:00.080 --> 22:01.847
Yes! Good boy!

22:01.882 --> 22:03.716
Good boy!

22:09.789 --> 22:10.755
Something wrong, Jack?

22:10.790 --> 22:13.324
Nope.
No, just wondering

22:13.358 --> 22:15.794
when you're gonna get around
to telling me

22:15.828 --> 22:17.395
what's going on with Caleb?

22:18.330 --> 22:21.566
I...

22:22.534 --> 22:24.868
I didn't wanna get you involved
in all this,

22:24.903 --> 22:27.504
but let's just say,

22:27.538 --> 22:30.774
I think you can safely hire
someone else.

22:30.809 --> 22:31.842
What?!

22:31.876 --> 22:33.443
Caleb took a swing at me, Jack.

22:33.478 --> 22:36.213
Now, why the hell
would he do something like that?

22:36.247 --> 22:38.048
I don't know, I have no idea.

22:38.083 --> 22:39.649
And to be honest with you,
I don't give a damn.

22:39.683 --> 22:42.085
I just want him out of here,
I want him gone.

22:42.119 --> 22:43.419
Lou said she'd take care of it.

22:43.453 --> 22:45.088
Well, let's get something straight!

22:46.023 --> 22:47.903
Lou might be signing
Caleb's cheques these days,

22:47.925 --> 22:50.059
but I own this place, I hired him,

22:50.094 --> 22:51.894
so if anybody's gonna
take care of anything,

22:51.929 --> 22:54.863
they'd better consult with me first!

22:54.897 --> 22:56.832
Well, okay, let's consider this
is a consultation then.

22:56.866 --> 22:58.266
I mean, come on, the guy
took a swing at me, Jack.

22:58.300 --> 23:00.201
What do you want me to do?

23:00.236 --> 23:02.004
What would you do?

23:02.038 --> 23:03.371
Well, when I was your age,

23:03.405 --> 23:05.206
there's no doubt I would've
kicked the crap out of him.

23:05.241 --> 23:08.409
But as you get older, and wiser,

23:09.846 --> 23:12.780
you end up just hoping that
people can work things out.

23:15.283 --> 23:16.884
How am I supposed to do that?

23:16.952 --> 23:18.819
I'm not exactly sure.

23:18.887 --> 23:20.087
One thing I do know,

23:20.155 --> 23:22.723
me letting you or Lou fire
my only ranch hand,

23:22.758 --> 23:26.091
that isn't gonna solve anything!

23:27.361 --> 23:28.962
You know, right there,
you missed a spot.

23:30.765 --> 23:31.831
Hey, Lou.

23:31.866 --> 23:33.800
Sorry, I must've lost track of time.

23:33.834 --> 23:36.435
Uh, no, actually, I'm early.

23:36.470 --> 23:38.838
You know me, make a schedule,
stick to it,

23:38.873 --> 23:41.207
say you're gonna do something, do it.

23:41.275 --> 23:42.375
So...

23:44.144 --> 23:45.310
Engine trouble?

23:45.378 --> 23:46.411
Yeah.

23:47.346 --> 23:48.647
I put in a new alternator,

23:48.715 --> 23:50.749
but the battery still keeps
conking out on me.

23:50.817 --> 23:53.552
Have you used
your jumper cables lately?

23:53.586 --> 23:55.320
Uh... That's why I got
the new alternator.

23:55.388 --> 23:56.388
Because you see, Lou,

23:56.422 --> 23:58.290
what an alternator's supposed to do

23:58.357 --> 23:59.857
is keep the batteries charged.

23:59.892 --> 24:02.927
Well, have you checked
your voltage on the main feed wire?

24:02.961 --> 24:04.328
This one right here.

24:04.362 --> 24:06.097
See, it has a link to it
that jumper cables can burn out,

24:06.131 --> 24:07.899
just like a fuse.

24:08.867 --> 24:10.068
You don't grow up on a ranch

24:10.135 --> 24:13.304
without learning something
about alternators.

24:13.338 --> 24:14.419
Why don't I give you a hand?

24:14.472 --> 24:15.833
You know, Ty must have a multimeter

24:15.873 --> 24:16.873
around here somewhere, I can...

24:16.908 --> 24:18.909
Lou...
No, thanks.

24:20.377 --> 24:21.945
Listen...

24:21.979 --> 24:23.880
I understand why you're here.

24:23.948 --> 24:24.881
And I'm not gonna lie,

24:24.949 --> 24:26.850
I like my job, and the money,

24:26.918 --> 24:27.984
but you don't need
to tie yourself in knots

24:28.052 --> 24:28.985
over this.

24:29.053 --> 24:30.087
You gotta do what you gotta do,

24:30.154 --> 24:31.634
and if firing me is what you gotta do,

24:31.688 --> 24:34.056
then...
No hard feelings.

24:34.124 --> 24:36.726
Let's just get 'er done.

24:38.494 --> 24:40.329
Fire you?

24:40.396 --> 24:41.831
Who said anything about firing you?

24:41.898 --> 24:43.465
I'm...

24:43.533 --> 24:46.866
I mean, okay, yeah,
Peter is a little...

24:46.936 --> 24:48.737
Let's just say that
it's been put out there -

24:48.804 --> 24:50.138
you know, floated as an option

24:50.172 --> 24:51.773
in a casual way -

24:51.807 --> 24:53.774
but I'm not gonna let it happen, Caleb.

24:53.842 --> 24:55.442
Trust me.

24:55.476 --> 24:56.409
And you know what?

24:56.477 --> 24:58.212
I'm gonna talk to Peter about this

24:58.246 --> 24:59.312
as soon as I get home,

24:59.380 --> 25:01.481
and I'm sure he's gonna come around.

25:01.549 --> 25:03.617
So don't even worry about it.

25:03.684 --> 25:05.986
And good luck with your alternator.

25:11.324 --> 25:13.459
So Caleb punches me,

25:13.526 --> 25:16.528
and neither you or Jack
are gonna fire him?

25:16.563 --> 25:19.896
Yeah, except maybe it wasn't
100 percent Caleb's fault.

25:21.301 --> 25:23.236
Of course it was his fault!

25:23.270 --> 25:24.303
What is...

25:26.338 --> 25:27.906
What're you saying?

25:28.841 --> 25:29.975
I might've, accidentally,

25:30.042 --> 25:32.744
given Caleb the impression
that I was...

25:34.413 --> 25:36.181
<i>That there were issues.</i>

25:36.215 --> 25:37.783
That our marriage...

25:38.751 --> 25:40.551
That you weren't the perfect husband

25:40.586 --> 25:41.386
all the time.

25:41.453 --> 25:43.554
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

25:43.589 --> 25:45.723
Our marriage

25:45.758 --> 25:48.559
you discussed our marriage with Caleb?

25:48.594 --> 25:49.860
<i>With Caleb?!</i>

25:49.895 --> 25:51.095
He was-
he was just there

25:51.129 --> 25:52.530
when I needed someone to talk to.

25:52.564 --> 25:53.898
And I wasn't, is
that what you're saying?

25:53.932 --> 25:55.400
- No!
- Yeah, it sounds like it!

25:55.434 --> 25:57.568
No, honey, you weren't there!

25:57.603 --> 25:59.102
You never are!

25:59.136 --> 26:01.171
Because I have a job, Lou!
A real job!

26:01.205 --> 26:02.706
And I don't?!

26:02.740 --> 26:04.908
I'm just sitting around
eating chocolates all day?

26:04.942 --> 26:06.510
- That is not what-
- Except, oh wait!

26:06.544 --> 26:08.111
I don't have time to eat chocolates,

26:08.145 --> 26:10.681
because I'm too busy
raising our daughter!

26:10.715 --> 26:12.081
And Georgie!

26:12.116 --> 26:14.650
And trying to start a business
as a financial advisor,

26:14.685 --> 26:16.686
and run a dude ranch!

26:16.720 --> 26:19.021
Not to mention talking
to insurance companies,

26:19.055 --> 26:21.757
and-and building contractors
because you didn't bother to!

26:21.792 --> 26:23.793
Oh well, don't you dare go there!

26:23.827 --> 26:25.461
- No, what?
- That is totally unfair!

26:25.495 --> 26:27.663
Am I supposed to know
something about wiring?

26:27.698 --> 26:29.832
Am I supposed to talk to guys you hired

26:29.866 --> 26:32.334
about building codes,
and electrical systems?!

26:32.368 --> 26:34.436
No, absolutely not,
because you're too busy whining

26:34.470 --> 26:36.237
about our marriage to Caleb!

26:36.271 --> 26:37.872
And you're too busy going
to some stupid meeting

26:37.940 --> 26:40.908
about an oil well in Venezuela,
or Trinidad,

26:40.943 --> 26:44.011
to care about what is going on here!

26:45.280 --> 26:47.881
Yeah, I'm too busy to care, Lou.
Right.

26:47.915 --> 26:49.383
So what the hell,
I'll just pack my bags,

26:49.417 --> 26:51.184
and head back to Vancouver.
How's that?

26:51.219 --> 26:52.619
You may as well!

26:52.654 --> 26:54.421
You know, it's your home
away from home!

26:54.456 --> 26:56.390
You must be used to it by now!

26:58.226 --> 27:00.227
I was not whining!

27:12.227 --> 27:13.360
I guess you heard all that, huh?

27:13.428 --> 27:15.062
Pretty hard not to.

27:15.147 --> 27:17.148
Look, I just lost my temper,

27:17.216 --> 27:18.216
and you know,

27:18.250 --> 27:19.351
I said some things I already regret.

27:19.418 --> 27:20.452
I'm just coming out here to cool off,

27:20.486 --> 27:21.807
I'll go back in and make it right.

27:21.854 --> 27:24.621
Let me give you a word of advice.

27:25.657 --> 27:28.158
I think it's best...

27:28.226 --> 27:31.395
If you help me finish
seeding this lawn.

27:31.463 --> 27:33.364
Then you go back inside.

27:33.398 --> 27:36.731
Better for you, better for Lou,

27:36.768 --> 27:38.502
better for me.

27:45.542 --> 27:46.743
Are you okay?

27:46.810 --> 27:48.578
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:50.514 --> 27:51.814
Lou...

27:52.783 --> 27:55.084
Everything's gonna be all right.

27:55.151 --> 27:57.151
Are you sure about that?

27:59.889 --> 28:03.222
Yeah, you and Peter are both
just super stressed out.

28:03.359 --> 28:05.660
But you love him, and he loves you.

28:07.430 --> 28:09.598
And this house thing, I mean...

28:09.665 --> 28:11.499
You'll get through it.

28:13.134 --> 28:15.135
What if we don't?

28:15.203 --> 28:16.670
What if that house was the glue

28:16.705 --> 28:17.938
that held us together?

28:18.006 --> 28:21.241
Oh, come on, Lou, there's other houses.

28:21.276 --> 28:22.710
Where? Here?

28:23.678 --> 28:25.078
Vancouver?

28:26.615 --> 28:28.080
Look, I get it, okay?

28:28.148 --> 28:30.483
I know he's doing what he has to do.

28:30.551 --> 28:31.684
You know, he's earning a living,

28:31.752 --> 28:33.219
and he's providing for his family,

28:33.253 --> 28:35.588
but even when he's here,

28:35.623 --> 28:38.157
it's like he's not here.

28:38.759 --> 28:42.092
And the last thing I need is
this stupid Caleb problem!

28:43.630 --> 28:45.997
What stupid Caleb problem?

28:49.368 --> 28:51.236
So Caleb got in a fight with Peter,

28:51.270 --> 28:53.739
and you didn't tell me.

28:54.707 --> 28:57.576
It wasn't a fight, Amy,
it was just one punch.

28:57.610 --> 29:00.611
And Lou asked me to keep it to myself.

29:00.646 --> 29:03.147
So what's happening now?

29:04.082 --> 29:05.917
Caleb tried to quit,
but Lou wouldn't let him.

29:06.852 --> 29:08.553
Well, that was a mistake!

29:08.587 --> 29:10.287
Because Lou and Peter
just got in a huge fight,

29:10.322 --> 29:12.857
and until this is resolved,
it's only gonna get worse.

29:12.891 --> 29:14.725
So Caleb needs to go and talk to Peter

29:14.760 --> 29:15.759
and make things right.

29:15.793 --> 29:16.860
Hey, guys!

29:17.795 --> 29:20.163
Whoa! Something I said?

29:28.840 --> 29:30.239
Hey, Lou.

29:31.275 --> 29:32.508
I just wanted to uh...

29:32.509 --> 29:34.176
<i>Say you're sorry?</i>

29:34.210 --> 29:36.144
Well, I don't wanna hear it.

29:36.179 --> 29:38.647
It's too soon
to say you're sorry, Peter.

29:38.682 --> 29:39.648
Lou...

29:39.683 --> 29:42.217
No.
We have issues, okay?

29:42.251 --> 29:45.584
And saying you're sorry
isn't gonna solve anything,

29:45.789 --> 29:48.656
<i>and I know that you</i>
<i>just wanna stop fighting,</i>

29:48.691 --> 29:52.024
or make up, or have peace of mind,

29:52.127 --> 29:54.128
or closure,
or whatever you wanna call it.

29:54.196 --> 29:56.698
I actually just wanted
to get something to drink.

29:57.633 --> 30:00.502
Oh. I'm sorry.

30:03.605 --> 30:04.538
But you know what?
You're right, Lou,

30:04.606 --> 30:06.206
it is too soon.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.340
But while we're waiting
for the time to be right,

30:07.408 --> 30:08.408
you might wanna think about

30:08.442 --> 30:10.343
who should be doing the apologizing.

30:13.147 --> 30:14.781
I am so psyched.

30:14.849 --> 30:16.282
This show is really gonna
take me and Jeremy

30:16.350 --> 30:18.084
to the next level.

30:18.119 --> 30:20.085
And what level is that?

30:20.153 --> 30:21.954
I don't know... yet.

30:21.989 --> 30:23.856
But when two people share
a milestone event,

30:23.891 --> 30:26.959
it brings them closer, much closer.

30:26.994 --> 30:29.929
And who knows where things
could go from there?

30:29.997 --> 30:32.031
All because of one horse show?

30:32.065 --> 30:33.399
Here's hoping.

30:34.367 --> 30:36.368
Which means the pressure's on.

30:36.403 --> 30:38.237
It depends on how well I do.

30:38.271 --> 30:39.604
But there's nothing like a spike

30:39.672 --> 30:41.873
in your serotonin levels
to keep you motivated,

30:41.908 --> 30:45.241
and believe me, I am 100 percent...

30:45.445 --> 30:47.679
You'll understand when you're older.

30:47.747 --> 30:49.048
<i>Hey there, Phoenix.</i>

30:49.082 --> 30:51.283
<i>Oh my gosh!</i>

30:52.217 --> 30:54.252
He came early!

30:54.319 --> 30:57.388
Which must mean he wants
to spend more time with me!

30:57.456 --> 30:59.556
How do I look?

30:59.623 --> 31:00.890
The same as always.

31:00.958 --> 31:02.592
Which is good enough.

31:02.660 --> 31:04.127
Wish me luck!

31:08.299 --> 31:10.667
Hey! Mallory, listen.

31:10.734 --> 31:13.170
Uh, bad news.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.237
The show at Hillhurst...

31:18.809 --> 31:19.876
Sorry.

31:30.587 --> 31:32.588
<i>So what's happening?</i>

31:34.591 --> 31:36.491
What's going on?

31:38.761 --> 31:40.128
They canceled the show?

31:40.162 --> 31:41.797
The guys who own Hillhurst-

31:41.864 --> 31:42.798
they just changed their minds,

31:42.865 --> 31:44.332
just like that!

31:44.366 --> 31:46.934
They basically pulled the plug
on the whole thing.

31:47.002 --> 31:49.003
Guys, I'm so sorry, that sucks.

31:49.037 --> 31:50.471
Jeremy says it happens all the time.

31:50.538 --> 31:51.939
It's no biggie.

31:51.974 --> 31:53.140
<i>Yeah, well, it
feels like a biggie to me!</i>

31:53.208 --> 31:55.042
<i>This is totally not fair!</i>

31:55.110 --> 31:57.311
What is going on in here?

31:57.345 --> 31:58.512
They canceled the show!

31:58.546 --> 32:00.581
After all the work we put into it!

32:00.616 --> 32:02.216
Well, let's not get carried away.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.417
There's always gonna be other shows.

32:04.485 --> 32:05.986
We don't care about other shows!

32:06.020 --> 32:08.521
We wanted this show,
Jack, it was the perfect timing.

32:08.555 --> 32:10.356
Yeah, I was gonna cream Olivia!

32:10.390 --> 32:11.958
Okay! You're right,

32:11.993 --> 32:14.694
we can't quit now,
and we don't have to.

32:14.729 --> 32:16.596
Did you not you hear
what we just told you?

32:16.631 --> 32:18.264
<i>There's no show.</i>

32:18.298 --> 32:20.365
<i>Exactly! That means
there's nothing to even quit from!</i>

32:20.399 --> 32:21.800
Come on, you guys!

32:21.835 --> 32:23.035
You have worked way too hard
to give up now

32:23.069 --> 32:25.437
just because someone cancels a show.

32:25.471 --> 32:27.172
We'll put on the show ourselves.

32:27.206 --> 32:28.774
I mean, how hard can it be, you...

32:28.808 --> 32:30.575
Oh Lou, n-no!

32:30.610 --> 32:32.444
Oh yes, Grampa.

32:32.478 --> 32:34.579
<i>We'll put up some jumps,</i>
<i>rent some portable toilets.</i>

32:34.614 --> 32:36.294
She's right;
Mom used to do it all the time.

32:36.849 --> 32:39.583
We just seeded all that grass!

32:48.493 --> 32:50.161
Hey!

32:50.195 --> 32:52.796
Hey, get off the gra-
get off the grass!

32:52.830 --> 32:54.397
What did I say?!

32:54.431 --> 32:55.932
The far side!

32:55.967 --> 32:58.101
Would one of you please
take over the parking situation

32:58.136 --> 33:01.138
before he gives himself a heart attack?

33:01.172 --> 33:02.238
My God.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.908
Don't wrinkle it!

33:06.010 --> 33:08.044
Okay, I've settled on a mantra,

33:08.078 --> 33:11.411
but don't bother asking
'cause it has to be secret.

33:12.649 --> 33:15.117
I need one that rhymes with Olivia,

33:15.185 --> 33:17.486
but nothing rhymes with Olivia.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.521
Oh yeah?

33:19.556 --> 33:22.889
How about, "I'm going
to send you back to Bolivia."

33:23.125 --> 33:25.827
Or, "I'm going to spit on you
with salivia."

33:27.596 --> 33:30.431
<i>Or, "I've got a world
of pain I'm gonna give-ia?"</i>

33:30.465 --> 33:31.800
Wow, looking good.

33:32.768 --> 33:35.003
Hey boy, how you doin'?

33:35.037 --> 33:37.906
Oh, and Mallory, if you ride
as well as I know you can,

33:37.940 --> 33:39.606
you'll be putting a ribbon
on your bedroom wall,

33:39.674 --> 33:40.708
guaranteed.

33:42.410 --> 33:45.045
But I'll catch up with you
in the hitching ring, okay?

33:45.080 --> 33:46.146
Okay.

33:48.449 --> 33:49.850
Did you hear that?

33:49.884 --> 33:51.484
He said I was looking good!

33:51.552 --> 33:54.654
He was talking about the horse.

34:04.138 --> 34:05.905
<i>Hello, and welcome, everyone,</i>

34:05.974 --> 34:08.574
to the First Annual
Heartland Equestrian Connection

34:08.641 --> 34:10.243
Schooling Show.

34:14.947 --> 34:17.315
I'd like to start by
giving a big shout out

34:17.384 --> 34:19.318
to all of our hard-working
volunteers.

34:21.254 --> 34:22.754
First up in the Novice Class,

34:22.822 --> 34:26.155
we have Olivia Wheaton, number 23,

34:26.426 --> 34:28.726
<i>riding Budget Buster.</i>

34:36.168 --> 34:37.202
She's good.

34:38.437 --> 34:41.306
She's okay.
She's just okay.

34:46.511 --> 34:48.879
No, she's really good!

34:58.789 --> 34:59.990
<i>With only one time fault,</i>

35:00.057 --> 35:02.425
<i>that makes Olivia the one to beat!</i>

35:06.796 --> 35:07.863
Good boy.

35:10.734 --> 35:12.502
She didn't knock down a single rail,

35:12.569 --> 35:13.669
and she was doing all that stuff

35:13.703 --> 35:15.238
- that you told me to do!
- It's okay.

35:15.272 --> 35:16.438
So you just have to do what she did,

35:16.472 --> 35:17.506
only a little better.

35:17.540 --> 35:19.241
But let him do his job, okay?

35:19.308 --> 35:20.808
Don't push, don't panic.

35:23.146 --> 35:24.679
Hey Georgie,

35:24.713 --> 35:26.048
<i>why don't you quit now?</i>

35:26.082 --> 35:27.882
You don't have a chance.

35:27.950 --> 35:29.317
Oh yeah? Watch me.

35:29.385 --> 35:31.853
Oh, believe me,
I have better things to do.

35:31.887 --> 35:34.121
Oh yeah?
Then why are you here?

35:34.156 --> 35:36.457
Let's go.

35:36.491 --> 35:38.692
I don't even have a mantra yet!

35:38.726 --> 35:41.295
What about,
"Gonna give it to ya, Olivia?"

35:41.329 --> 35:43.664
Mm. Why don't we try
something a little more positive?

35:43.698 --> 35:46.067
"Ace, ace, in your face!"

35:46.101 --> 35:48.501
You know, one thing my mom
always used to tell me was,

35:48.536 --> 35:50.570
"Keep calm and carry on."

35:50.604 --> 35:53.073
But that doesn't say anything
about crushing Olivia!

35:53.107 --> 35:56.242
<i>Next up, we have Georgina Crawley,</i>

35:56.277 --> 35:57.977
number 16,

35:58.011 --> 35:59.745
<i>riding Phoenix Rising.</i>

36:01.115 --> 36:02.515
Go, Georgie!

36:03.717 --> 36:05.884
I'm gonna watch from down there, okay?

36:11.791 --> 36:13.392
Excuse me.
Go, Georgie!

36:25.070 --> 36:26.204
Slow down.

36:26.238 --> 36:28.038
She's going too fast.

36:28.073 --> 36:30.874
Keep calm and carry on.

36:32.644 --> 36:33.944
That's it! Yes!

37:03.405 --> 37:04.840
That was so good!

37:05.808 --> 37:08.977
Yeah, except I knocked down a rail.

37:09.012 --> 37:10.679
It's okay.
You know, you didn't win,

37:10.713 --> 37:11.813
but this was your first time out

37:11.881 --> 37:13.081
and you might get a ribbon!

37:13.116 --> 37:14.582
I'd say that's pretty amazing.

37:14.650 --> 37:17.151
Yeah, I guess it is.

37:17.185 --> 37:18.185
What you told me your mom said

37:18.253 --> 37:19.620
really helped me.

37:19.688 --> 37:21.922
Yeah, it worked for me too.

37:24.325 --> 37:27.128
And in second place, Georgina Crawley.

37:28.463 --> 37:30.031
<i>Yeah, Georgie!</i>

37:31.565 --> 37:34.333
Congratulations.
Very nice round.

37:37.104 --> 37:39.005
In first place, Olivia Wheaton.

37:40.808 --> 37:44.141
Congratulations, a very good ride.

37:48.347 --> 37:51.216
Better luck next time...
Georgina.

37:51.785 --> 37:53.652
You too.
You're gonna need it, loser!

38:05.430 --> 38:06.950
<i>Yeah, you're a real hotshot!</i>

38:08.100 --> 38:09.266
Yeah, yeah.

38:09.301 --> 38:10.768
Coaching little girls
who can barely ride.

38:10.803 --> 38:12.704
<i>I have hit it big time!</i>

38:12.738 --> 38:14.939
You're bad!

38:20.678 --> 38:21.978
What's that?

38:22.046 --> 38:24.280
I don't know, did you hear something?

38:24.315 --> 38:25.481
No.

38:42.794 --> 38:44.162
Hey, Pete, um...

38:45.097 --> 38:46.831
Listen, I-I was thinking
we should probably talk.

38:46.865 --> 38:48.599
You wanna talk?

38:48.633 --> 38:51.201
What do you wanna talk about?
You sucker punched me, man!

38:51.235 --> 38:53.303
I just...
I want to apologize.

38:53.338 --> 38:55.238
I'm really sorry,
I-I just...

38:55.273 --> 38:56.739
I kinda lost it.

38:56.774 --> 38:59.042
You lost it.
You're sorry.

38:59.077 --> 39:00.677
So what?

39:00.711 --> 39:02.712
So there's gotta be something
I can do about it?

39:02.746 --> 39:03.947
I don't think so.

39:03.982 --> 39:05.414
Let's make it even.

39:06.350 --> 39:07.450
<i>Yeah, pop me one.</i>

39:07.484 --> 39:09.118
Just let me have it.

39:10.053 --> 39:11.620
I don't think so, Caleb.

39:11.654 --> 39:13.022
Come on, I know you want to,

39:13.056 --> 39:16.058
and it'll make us both feel better.

39:17.861 --> 39:19.761
Are you serious?

39:19.796 --> 39:21.396
Positive.

39:21.430 --> 39:24.432
Just uh...
Woo! Let 'er rip.

39:28.471 --> 39:29.570
Oh!

39:30.539 --> 39:31.572
Agh!

39:32.741 --> 39:33.875
<i>Ohhh...</i>

39:39.314 --> 39:41.048
Is that all you got?

39:44.252 --> 39:46.520
Yeah, you almost had me there, Caleb.

39:46.554 --> 39:48.022
Ohh... yeah.

39:48.956 --> 39:51.025
So are we square?

39:52.293 --> 39:53.592
Don't you got some work to do
or something?

39:53.660 --> 39:55.428
Yeah, I do.

39:57.764 --> 39:58.831
Whoa!

40:04.071 --> 40:06.272
Hey, where you been?

40:06.340 --> 40:08.374
Hey, uh... sorry.

40:08.409 --> 40:11.742
I just, um, I had some stuff
to take care of.

40:11.977 --> 40:13.645
What happened to you?

40:14.914 --> 40:17.215
Did you work things out with Peter?

40:17.250 --> 40:20.583
Yeah! Yeah,
everything's cool now.

40:22.655 --> 40:24.256
<i>Can I have your attention, please?</i>

40:24.290 --> 40:25.689
As soon as everyone is ready,

40:25.723 --> 40:29.056
we are going to start
the Intermediate Class.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.363
Hey.

40:32.431 --> 40:34.765
Honey, what-
what are you doing?

40:34.832 --> 40:36.567
I think we've waited
long enough, don't you?

40:36.634 --> 40:38.001
It's been days, Lou.

40:38.070 --> 40:40.104
So, what?
You wanna talk here?

40:40.138 --> 40:42.405
Now? I mean, in front
of all these people?

40:42.473 --> 40:43.473
Because, Peter,

40:43.507 --> 40:45.241
I am not ready to say I'm sorry.

40:45.309 --> 40:47.343
Okay.
I'm okay with that.

40:47.411 --> 40:48.511
And I don't wanna have
the same argument

40:48.546 --> 40:50.980
over and over again either, I don't.

40:51.048 --> 40:54.217
And nothing says I'm sorry like...

40:54.285 --> 40:56.486
Peter, don't say that here!

40:56.520 --> 40:57.686
Well, I don't care!

40:57.720 --> 40:59.200
- I'll tell everyone I love you--
- No, get--

40:59.222 --> 41:01.790
Ladies and gentlemen...

41:02.825 --> 41:03.858
I'm sorry.

41:05.462 --> 41:06.895
I love you.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.167
I love you too.

41:13.135 --> 41:15.269
You idiot.

41:22.877 --> 41:25.846
Mallory, come on, you're up.

41:25.914 --> 41:27.515
Is everything okay?

41:27.549 --> 41:30.484
Yeah. I even have
a new mantra.

41:30.585 --> 41:32.785
Well, where's Jeremy?
I thought he was coaching you.

41:32.820 --> 41:35.489
Yeah, but I don't know where he is.

41:35.556 --> 41:37.824
<i>First up in the Intermediate Class,</i>

41:37.858 --> 41:38.825
<i>wearing number 67...</i>

41:38.892 --> 41:40.093
Okay, let's get you up.

41:40.161 --> 41:43.396
<i>Mallory Wells, on Spartan.</i>

41:46.433 --> 41:48.234
All right, deep breath.
You're gonna do great.

41:48.268 --> 41:49.435
Okay...

41:56.042 --> 41:58.110
True hearts can't be broken.

42:01.713 --> 42:03.314
Let's go, Mallory!

42:21.299 --> 42:23.300
- Woo!
- Yes!
