WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:06.740
[theme music]

00:07.741 --> 00:08.709
All right, Walter.

00:08.809 --> 00:09.610
What's it going to be?

00:09.710 --> 00:11.145
It's unbelievable, Roseanne.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.746
I just sold a
television set that lets

00:12.846 --> 00:14.448
you watch two channels at once.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.217
Yeah, so you can watch
what you're watching,

00:16.317 --> 00:18.086
and you can watch what you're
missing at the same time.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.287
Yeah.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.289
But what you're really
missing is life, Roseanne,

00:21.389 --> 00:22.290
because life doesn't fi--

00:22.390 --> 00:25.059
You're getting soup.

00:25.159 --> 00:28.362
I hate it when his mommy
don't pack his lunch.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.198
Oh, dammit!
- What?

00:30.298 --> 00:31.265
What?

00:31.365 --> 00:33.801
Oh, [groans] I threw
out my back again.

00:33.901 --> 00:34.902
Oh, man.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.138
Oh, god, this is just
getting ridiculous.

00:37.238 --> 00:38.339
How am I supposed
to work when this

00:38.439 --> 00:39.573
keeps happening all the time?

00:39.673 --> 00:40.541
Oh, honey.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.176
Let me just sit
down for a minute.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.077
WOMAN: Miss?

00:43.177 --> 00:44.312
Look, you sit right here.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.147
I'll get that.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.482
Miss, uh, you got
any steak sauce?

00:48.582 --> 00:52.920
Yeah, it's, uh, on the other
side of the counter there.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.788
Do you mind going and
getting it yourself?

00:54.888 --> 00:57.391
I can't bend over too good.

00:57.491 --> 00:58.592
OK.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.194
Yeah, I've seen a couple
of doctors, you know.

01:00.294 --> 01:01.862
And they prescribe these
pills, but they just

01:01.962 --> 01:03.564
don't do anything.

01:03.664 --> 01:07.034
Excuse me, miss, can I get
my cake and coffee, please?

01:07.135 --> 01:08.068
Yeah.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.737
Do you mind getting
it yourself, but I

01:09.837 --> 01:12.706
can't really reach up too good.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.976
Cut yourself a great,
big slab of it.

01:16.076 --> 01:16.977
[bell dings]

01:18.045 --> 01:19.046
Walter, your soup's up.

01:19.147 --> 01:19.947
Got it.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.486
Roseanne, what are you doing?

01:25.586 --> 01:27.621
Well, you know, it's
taken me a while, Bonnie,

01:27.721 --> 01:32.893
but I do believe I'm finally
getting the hang of this job.

01:32.993 --> 01:36.397
[theme music]

02:13.934 --> 02:15.836
[laughs]

02:24.478 --> 02:25.479
Have a seat, Mrs. Conner.

02:25.579 --> 02:26.680
The doctor will be
here in a minute.

02:26.780 --> 02:27.615
Thank you, Diane.

02:27.715 --> 02:28.516
Mm-hm.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.418
So what'd he say?

02:30.518 --> 02:32.720
Well, he said, put your
clothes on, I'm done, you know,

02:32.820 --> 02:33.687
like any man.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.233
No, Dr. Dixon will
be able to help you.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.133
Why?

02:46.234 --> 02:47.435
Because he's the best.

02:47.535 --> 02:50.638
He helped me so much when I
hurt my back on the force.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.540
And you have a crush on him.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.276
I do not.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.510
Well, I hope he
can do something,

02:56.610 --> 02:57.778
because it's just
not going to do

02:57.878 --> 02:59.913
for me to lay in bed every
time this happens anymore.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.350
I thought the girls
were taking care of you.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.951
No, they're sick of me.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.519
The next time I
ask for a pillow,

03:05.619 --> 03:09.156
they're going to come in there
and brick up my whole bedroom.

03:09.257 --> 03:12.159
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Mrs. Conner.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.060
Jackie!

03:13.160 --> 03:16.230
Hi, Dr. Dixon!

03:16.330 --> 03:17.498
How's the back?

03:17.598 --> 03:19.433
Oh, it's OK.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.370
It acts up every
once in a while.

03:22.470 --> 03:23.471
Since when?

03:23.571 --> 03:27.308
Since-- shut up.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.076
Well, maybe you should
make an appointment.

03:29.176 --> 03:29.977
Thanks.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.546
That'd be fun.

03:32.646 --> 03:35.048
Now, Mrs. Conner,
your X-rays show no

03:35.148 --> 03:36.850
spinal damage or abnormality.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.886
Which means it's
a muscular problem,

03:38.986 --> 03:41.322
and I should try
diet, and exercise,

03:41.422 --> 03:42.756
and maybe even hot baths.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.558
And you're going to prescribe
these little, blue pills

03:44.658 --> 03:46.126
that don't do anything.

03:46.226 --> 03:50.564
Well, I guess that just leaves
the small matter of my fee.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.400
So you can't do
anything either?

03:52.500 --> 03:53.801
Well, there is a
surgical procedure that

03:53.901 --> 03:55.336
would give you some relief.
- No thanks.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.470
Well, wait a minute.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.739
You haven't even
heard what it is yet.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.841
I'm talking about
a breast reduction.

04:00.941 --> 04:01.909
Uh-uh, yikes.

04:04.478 --> 04:05.479
Are you sure
you're not reading

04:05.579 --> 04:08.382
the wrong side of the X-rays?

04:08.482 --> 04:10.584
You have bra
strap pain, right?

04:10.684 --> 04:11.785
Yeah.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.387
And most of your problems
are in the upper back

04:13.487 --> 04:14.322
and shoulders.

04:14.422 --> 04:15.323
Yeah.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.291
So your back is
continually compensating

04:17.391 --> 04:19.059
for your front, which is, uh--

04:19.159 --> 04:19.960
Huge!

04:24.332 --> 04:26.667
You see, if you reduce
the weight of your breasts,

04:26.767 --> 04:28.101
your posture will be
better and that will

04:28.201 --> 04:29.437
lessen the lower back pain.

04:29.537 --> 04:30.871
It's all related.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.139
Do people really do this?

04:32.239 --> 04:33.407
Yeah, it's fairly common.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.676
And as surgeries go,
the risk is minimal.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.110
Well, what happens.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.245
Ah.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.881
Well, I brought a
brochure over to show you.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.050
See, the surgeon
makes an incision

04:43.150 --> 04:45.419
underneath the breast,
around the nipple,

04:45.519 --> 04:49.156
and then a vertical
line between the two.

04:49.256 --> 04:53.394
The excess breast
tissue is then removed,

04:53.494 --> 04:55.796
and the nipple is then
grafted back onto the breast

04:55.896 --> 04:59.132
in a higher position.

04:59.232 --> 05:02.570
What sick Nazi man
came up with this idea?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.442
It sounds worse than it is.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.878
Maybe it's something that
you should think about.

05:10.978 --> 05:11.845
It's crazy!

05:11.945 --> 05:14.848
Well, you've tried
everything else.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.851
Well, how much
do they take off?

05:17.951 --> 05:19.152
Just enough to make
sure you wouldn't

05:19.252 --> 05:20.988
need to see me anymore.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.357
Well, I mean, what am
I going to look like?

05:23.457 --> 05:25.626
I don't want the guy--
what if he goes crazy?

05:25.726 --> 05:28.362
I mean, I don't want to end
up looking like, you know--

05:28.462 --> 05:29.296
Hey, hey!

05:32.199 --> 05:33.367
I didn't mean that.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.603
I just meant that--
you know, I mean,

05:35.703 --> 05:37.505
these have been a big part
of what I am my whole life,

05:37.605 --> 05:38.606
you know?

05:38.706 --> 05:39.640
And now we're talking
about changing that.

05:39.740 --> 05:40.808
Well, maybe
you'll feel better.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.678
I don't know.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.313
I think it's just a moot
point anyway, because it's not

05:46.414 --> 05:48.148
like I could ever afford it.
- You don't know that.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.683
How much does something
like that cost?

05:49.783 --> 05:50.918
Around $6,000.

05:51.018 --> 05:51.819
Each?

05:53.387 --> 05:54.187
No.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.322
No, no.

05:55.423 --> 05:56.790
You see, since you've
had chronic problems,

05:56.890 --> 05:59.760
insurance would probably
cover about 80% of it.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.663
Look, obviously, you've got
a lot of thinking to do.

06:02.763 --> 06:06.567
And if you want, I can recommend
a wonderful specialist.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.836
Or you might want to
get a second opinion.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.003
No, don't worry.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.505
I'm sure I will when I get home.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.416
It's only one night
in the hospital.

06:22.516 --> 06:23.316
That's a pro.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.485
But it's the hospital.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.719
Con.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.220
Yeah, but you're in one
of those Art Linkletter beds

06:27.320 --> 06:29.289
with color TV and room service.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.190
Pro!

06:30.290 --> 06:31.625
But the food'll suck.

06:31.725 --> 06:32.860
Con.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.662
It sucks here.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.430
You'll be away from the kids.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.898
Yeah, but they'll
want to visit.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.533
Yeah, but you'll
be all drugged up,

06:39.633 --> 06:41.401
so you just call them names
and fall back asleep again.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.203
[laughs]

06:43.303 --> 06:45.305
Yeah, huge pro.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.540
Well, what about Dan, though?

06:46.640 --> 06:48.809
Oh, Dan wants
you to feel better.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.478
I don't even know how
to tell him about this.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.379
Well, if you want, I'll
think of some way to make it--

06:52.480 --> 06:53.313
Con, con, con.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.381
OK, fine, I
won't say anything.

06:54.482 --> 06:55.616
I'll just pretend
like nothing happened.

06:55.716 --> 06:56.950
Well, nothing
did happen, Jackie.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.318
I haven't even made
up my mind yet.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.386
I know, Mark.

06:59.487 --> 07:02.289
The car never even
made this noise before.

07:02.389 --> 07:05.459
Well, it's kind of
like a rattling noise.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.060
No, my father already fixed it.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.162
That's why I can't get
it out of the driveway.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.430
The car doesn't
have to run for you

07:10.531 --> 07:11.832
to live in it, little girl.

07:11.932 --> 07:12.733
Hey.

07:12.833 --> 07:13.701
Hey.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.069
How come you're
just sitting there?

07:16.169 --> 07:18.939
Waiting for dinner.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.341
Did it ever occur to
you to get off your butt

07:21.441 --> 07:23.176
and heat something up?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.145
Oh, no, it was way
too early to panic.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.217
Well, where's DJ?

07:30.317 --> 07:33.587
Oh, he got hungry and
went over to Todd's.

07:33.687 --> 07:37.157
God, if I didn't come home,
y'all would starve to death.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.192
Mom, will you
hem my new jeans?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.795
Yes, I will, but can I please
make dinner for you first?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.063
Please?

07:43.163 --> 07:45.499
Oh, if you're making
meatloaf, I'm just having salad.

07:45.599 --> 07:48.468
Does anyone here care
that this woman was just

07:48.569 --> 07:50.771
at the doctor's office and
has something very important

07:50.871 --> 07:52.105
to discuss with you all?

07:57.845 --> 07:59.046
Thank you, Jackie.

07:59.146 --> 08:03.016
It would have been stupid
to wait for the right time.

08:03.116 --> 08:03.984
What'd he tell you?

08:04.084 --> 08:06.186
Well, it's kind
of funny, actually.

08:06.286 --> 08:09.056
Oh, I, uh, went there
to talk about my back

08:09.156 --> 08:11.491
and all he just kept
talking about was my boobs.

08:13.694 --> 08:14.795
So what?

08:14.895 --> 08:18.431
Do you want me to go down
there and beat him up?

08:18.532 --> 08:21.301
No, he, uh, said I should
maybe think about getting

08:21.401 --> 08:23.871
a breast reduction.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.739
What?

08:25.839 --> 08:28.075
Well, you know, he said
it'd maybe help my back

08:28.175 --> 08:30.210
if I got my boobs shortened up.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.182
Are you going to do it?

08:35.282 --> 08:36.249
I haven't made up my mind yet.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.685
See, the doctor
says the reason

08:37.785 --> 08:40.087
that her back keeps going out
is because of all the weight

08:40.187 --> 08:40.988
up front.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.959
Well, how long would you
have to be in the hospital?

08:46.059 --> 08:49.329
The most she'd have to do is
go in there the night before.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.732
Yeah, but it'd take me a
couple of weeks to get better,

08:51.832 --> 08:54.534
you know, so you guys would have
to help out with the cooking

08:54.635 --> 08:55.836
and the house cleaning.
- [grumble]

08:55.936 --> 08:57.270
Yeah, but after
that, then your mom

08:57.370 --> 08:58.972
would be feeling better
and she could go back

08:59.072 --> 09:00.040
to doing all the chores again.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.675
You guys would be off the hook.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.110
[laughs]

09:03.210 --> 09:05.946
I want that to be
the last thing you say.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.781
Yeah, OK.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.516
Mom, if it'll
stop the back pain,

09:09.617 --> 09:11.585
I think you should
have the operation.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.520
I mean, you'll feel
better, you'll look great,

09:13.621 --> 09:15.222
you can go out and buy
all these new clothes.

09:15.322 --> 09:19.392
Is everything a trip to
the mall for you, Becky?

09:19.492 --> 09:22.095
Shut up, Darlene,
it'll be good for her.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.497
Yeah, well, I guess it is
something she's always wanted.

09:24.598 --> 09:25.999
What are you talking about?

09:26.099 --> 09:27.935
Oh, you know you
always wanted perky ones.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.109
Hey, Darlene, you try walking
around with your shoulders

09:36.209 --> 09:38.445
all hunched over and
your back up in knots.

09:38.545 --> 09:41.448
Then we'll talk about why
I'm really doing this.

09:41.548 --> 09:42.816
So you are doing it?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.051
Well--

09:44.151 --> 09:44.952
Come on, girls.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.754
Let's go get a pizza.
- Right.

09:46.854 --> 09:47.688
Come on, Darlene.

09:47.788 --> 09:48.588
Why are we leaving?

09:48.689 --> 09:50.257
This affects all of us.

09:50.357 --> 09:53.193
Hey, Darlene, ever since
you went on solid foods,

09:53.293 --> 09:56.830
they ceased to be
any concern of yours.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.731
Come on, Darlene.

09:57.831 --> 09:58.632
Let's go.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.603
[sighs]

10:06.139 --> 10:07.307
I'm gonna make a sandwich.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.742
You want a sandwich?

10:08.842 --> 10:11.478
Well, I want you to
talk to me about this.

10:11.578 --> 10:12.680
It's your decision, honey.

10:12.780 --> 10:13.981
Whatever you want to do.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.650
Yeah, I know, but I want
you to tell me how you feel.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.551
I don't know how I feel.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.020
I mean, I'm sitting
here waiting for dinner,

10:20.120 --> 10:21.221
and you come in and
say you're going

10:21.321 --> 10:23.090
to get your breasts reduced.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.458
How am I supposed to feel?

10:25.558 --> 10:27.661
I mean, is this the only way?

10:27.761 --> 10:29.462
Have you tried everything else?

10:29.562 --> 10:31.198
Does it got to be surgery?

10:31.298 --> 10:32.299
Why?

10:32.399 --> 10:33.734
What's bothering you
about the surgery, Dan?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.068
Are you afraid of how
I'm going to look?

10:35.168 --> 10:36.837
No, no, no.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.438
Well, then are you
afraid of the money,

10:38.538 --> 10:39.740
'cause you know the insurance--

10:39.840 --> 10:41.574
No, no, no, it's
not the money.

10:41.675 --> 10:42.509
Well then what is it?

10:42.609 --> 10:45.512
What was the first one again?

10:45.612 --> 10:47.380
Well, I was worried about
how I was going to look too,

10:47.480 --> 10:49.549
you know, but then
I saw these pictures

10:49.649 --> 10:50.684
of what you look like after.

10:50.784 --> 10:51.885
And I would just look normal.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.420
Well, I don't want
you looking normal.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.089
I like you the way you are.

10:56.189 --> 10:59.226
I should have said
it was the money.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.929
No, I asked you how you
felt, and you told me.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.797
So what, am I a big
pig now because that's

11:03.897 --> 11:04.865
what was bothering me?

11:04.965 --> 11:06.700
No, because that
was bothering me too.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.005
You really think this is
going to make you feel better?

11:12.105 --> 11:13.907
Yeah, I really think I do.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.109
We'll have to deal with it.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.078
Yeah, you know, I'm not
going to change or anything.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.380
I'm still going to be the
same woman that you married.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.783
I'll just be in a lot less
pain, so I won't be grumpy,

11:22.883 --> 11:25.753
and crabby, and whiny
all the time, you know?

11:25.853 --> 11:29.089
OK, so I won't exactly be
the same woman you married.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.033
Come on in, Rose.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.169
Is anybody in there
hooked up to any tubes,

11:42.269 --> 11:44.204
or machines, or hoses?

11:44.304 --> 11:45.372
No.

11:45.472 --> 11:49.777
Oh, good, 'cause I
don't care for that.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.779
Hey, this ain't bad.
- Yeah, I don't know.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.246
Hospital rooms
give me the creeps.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.048
Well, that's Because every
time we check out of one,

11:55.148 --> 11:57.650
we got a new kid.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.652
Whoa, whoa, what's that smell?

11:59.753 --> 12:00.553
My nose is burning.

12:00.653 --> 12:01.588
[sniffs]

12:01.688 --> 12:04.324
Oh, that's the clean, Dan.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.392
No kiddin'?

12:05.492 --> 12:08.728
Yeah, don't go
getting used to it now.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.298
Well, for your dining
pleasure this evening,

12:11.398 --> 12:15.668
we are serving
clear beef bouillon

12:15.769 --> 12:19.940
or chicken bouillon, which the
chef informs me is also clear.

12:20.040 --> 12:20.841
Is that it?

12:20.941 --> 12:24.044
Huh-huh, if you
still have room!

12:24.144 --> 12:27.380
Our dessert tray consists of a
shimmering brick of green jello

12:27.480 --> 12:29.382
and the tray itself.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.151
Dan, will you do me a favor?

12:31.251 --> 12:35.088
Go down the hall and drag
that snack machine in here.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.257
You're not supposed to
eat before the surgery.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.392
I was only going to lick
the salt off the Fritos.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.728
You can eat 'em.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.496
How long are visiting hours?

12:43.596 --> 12:44.397
I don't know.

12:44.497 --> 12:45.866
Stay and keep me company.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.968
OK.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.369
[turns tv on]

12:52.139 --> 12:52.940
Sports channel!

12:55.575 --> 12:57.544
Dan, we got a private room.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.947
Good deal.

13:00.047 --> 13:03.783
You want to fool around?

13:03.884 --> 13:06.386
In the hospital?

13:06.486 --> 13:08.055
Yeah, lookit, the
bed goes up and down.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.156
You wouldn't have to do nothing.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.499
I don't think so.

13:19.599 --> 13:20.800
Nah.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.369
Are you OK with all this?

13:22.469 --> 13:23.670
What are you
worried about me for?

13:23.770 --> 13:25.472
Are you OK?
- Yeah.

13:25.572 --> 13:26.539
Then me too.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.607
Are you sure?

13:27.707 --> 13:29.442
Honey, I'm with
you all the way.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.178
I'm going to be here when
they wheel you down there,

13:31.278 --> 13:33.346
I'm going to be
here when it's over.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.714
And while it's happening,
I'm going to be

13:34.814 --> 13:37.684
so far away and so liquored up.

13:37.784 --> 13:38.618
Am I interrupting?

13:38.718 --> 13:39.719
No, it's OK.

13:39.819 --> 13:40.587
Hi!

13:40.687 --> 13:41.688
JACKIE: OK, come on in.

13:41.788 --> 13:42.689
ALL: Surprise!

13:42.789 --> 13:44.657
For they were
jolly good fellows.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.659
For they were
jolly good fellows.

13:46.759 --> 13:51.631
For they were jolly good
fellows, which nobody can deny.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.633
[air escapes balloons]

13:53.733 --> 13:55.102
[laughter]

13:55.202 --> 13:58.105
Oh, lookit, a boob cake!

13:58.205 --> 13:59.072
Where'd you get that?

13:59.172 --> 14:00.840
I saw it in "Good
Housekeeping."

14:00.941 --> 14:02.775
Well, actually, it was
for a kitty cat face,

14:02.876 --> 14:06.079
but I just took the ears
off and doubled the recipe.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.515
Boy, am I leaving.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.317
I'll be here first
thing in the morning.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.218
So will I.

14:11.318 --> 14:12.185
No cake for her.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.520
- Bye, Dan.
- Bye, Dan.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.421
Bye, Dan.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.722
He seems to be doing better.

14:15.822 --> 14:19.826
Yeah, well, it'd be a lot
easier if he was a leg man.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.962
Oh, now, Roseanne,
you know Dan tells

14:22.062 --> 14:23.997
everybody that the first
thing he noticed about you

14:24.097 --> 14:25.065
was your eyes.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.400
Well, men have to
say that, Crystal.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.202
That's the law.
ANNE-MARIE: Mm-hm.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.203
But you know they're lying.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.005
All they think about
are our chests.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.141
At least every guy
I ever went out with.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.776
You know, I read an article
that said that one reason why

14:36.876 --> 14:39.079
men are so obsessed
with breasts is

14:39.179 --> 14:41.982
that they represent
security, and nurturing,

14:42.082 --> 14:43.350
and-- and motherhood.

14:43.450 --> 14:48.888
Oh-oh-oh, that's why
they call 'em hooters.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.590
They have the nerve
to say that they

14:50.690 --> 14:52.292
love you for your brain, right?
WOMAN: Yeah, right?

14:52.392 --> 14:53.793
Right, which can't be
true, because they've

14:53.893 --> 14:57.064
only got one word for "brain."

14:57.164 --> 14:59.299
If that was true,
all those bars would

14:59.399 --> 15:01.168
be having wet hat contests.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.038
I brought you a
present, Roseanne.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.706
ROSEANNE: Oh, goody-goody,
let me see, let me see.

15:06.806 --> 15:08.141
Oh, give me it.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.442
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.343
Oh!

15:10.443 --> 15:12.912
[applause]

15:13.013 --> 15:14.381
Lookit, no underwire!

15:14.481 --> 15:17.350
No underwire!

15:17.450 --> 15:19.219
Now I can, uh,
go through the, uh,

15:19.319 --> 15:21.588
metal detector at the airport
without setting it off.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.165
[beeping]

15:32.265 --> 15:35.235
All right, Mrs. Conner,
we're about ready.

15:35.335 --> 15:38.405
Did everybody
wash their hands?

15:38.505 --> 15:40.207
- Yes, ma'am.
- Who are you?

15:40.307 --> 15:41.241
You're not my doctor.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.010
I'm Dr. Foster.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.211
I'm your anesthesiologist.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.578
Well, do you have
any pull around here?

15:45.678 --> 15:48.215
Because I never
did get my jello.

15:48.315 --> 15:51.351
Now, just count
backwards from 100.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.987
OK, but if I wake
up with a baby,

15:54.087 --> 15:57.290
I'm going to personally
(SPEECH SLOWING) kick your ass.

16:02.329 --> 16:05.298
DAN: Rosie.

16:05.398 --> 16:06.199
Rosie.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.537
Wake up, sleepy head.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.438
ROSEANNE: Dan?

16:11.538 --> 16:12.339
Hi, honey.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.973
How do you feel?

16:14.074 --> 16:15.675
How did everything go?

16:15.775 --> 16:17.410
Oh, the operation went great.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.612
The surgeon said it
was his best work ever.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.881
I want to see!
I want to see!

16:21.981 --> 16:24.317
OK, there's a mirror
over by the wall.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.218
Let me help you up.

16:32.259 --> 16:35.662
[screams]

16:35.762 --> 16:37.630
Great, huh?

16:37.730 --> 16:42.102
They were supposed
to make 'em smaller!

16:42.202 --> 16:44.604
This is better.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.573
Oh, my god!

16:46.673 --> 16:48.575
Oh, my gaw-awd!

16:48.675 --> 16:51.010
Calm down, Mrs.
Conner, calm down.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.813
I've got your jello right here.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.682
What did you do to me?

16:55.782 --> 16:57.117
What happened?

16:57.217 --> 16:59.552
You had a breast enlargement.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.289
And a great one!

17:02.389 --> 17:03.956
I was supposed to
have a reduction!

17:04.057 --> 17:05.392
You made a mistake!

17:05.492 --> 17:07.194
That's not true, Mrs. Conner.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.996
See, here's your release
form right there.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.864
There's your signature.

17:11.964 --> 17:13.566
But my doctor told me
what he was going to do.

17:13.666 --> 17:14.534
Where is he?

17:14.634 --> 17:15.735
I want to see my doctor.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.105
I want to see him now!

17:18.205 --> 17:19.072
(ANNOYED) Right away.

17:22.109 --> 17:23.943
Doctor, we need you.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.347
Yes?

17:42.129 --> 17:43.029
What's wrong?

17:43.130 --> 17:43.930
Not big enough?

17:51.138 --> 17:52.739
DAN: Rosie.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.107
Rosie.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.475
Dan?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.910
She's awake, Jacks.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.412
Roseanne, hi.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.613
How are ya?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.386
[sighs] Way to go, Doogie.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.474
Hm.

18:27.574 --> 18:32.044
[inhales] [exhales] Well, now
I just got to work on this.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.053
Stop it.

18:41.154 --> 18:44.591
- I'm not touching you.
- I'm warning you, DJ.

18:44.691 --> 18:45.492
Quit it.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.026
I'm not touching you.

18:47.126 --> 18:47.927
That's it.

18:50.597 --> 18:51.398
[thwack]

18:51.498 --> 18:53.833
DJ: Ow!

18:53.933 --> 18:55.968
Dad, I never touched her.

18:56.068 --> 18:59.239
Well, it was hardly
worth it then, was it, son?

18:59.339 --> 19:01.974
How come you guys
are still home so late?

19:02.074 --> 19:04.944
Becky, drive your brother
and sister to school.

19:05.044 --> 19:06.846
Yeah, Deej, let's
go for a little ride.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.581
I'm taking the bus.

19:08.681 --> 19:09.782
Oh, that's real smart.

19:09.882 --> 19:14.120
There's 70 kids waiting
to beat him up on the bus.

19:14.221 --> 19:16.055
So mom, first
day back to work?

19:16.155 --> 19:17.257
That's right.

19:17.357 --> 19:20.193
You gonna take the twins
out for show-and-tell?

19:20.293 --> 19:21.160
Har, har.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.629
Go to school, Darlene.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.597
All right, all right.

19:24.697 --> 19:29.168
Uh, by the way, you look nice.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.937
How many times do I
have to tell you, Darlene?

19:31.037 --> 19:32.939
I did this so I
would feel better,

19:33.039 --> 19:35.608
not so I would look better.

19:35.708 --> 19:36.976
God, take a pill.

19:40.947 --> 19:41.748
So?

19:44.417 --> 19:45.685
What?

19:45.785 --> 19:47.086
How do I look?

19:47.186 --> 19:48.087
Oh, you know me.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.922
I'm a sucker for a
woman in uniform.

19:50.022 --> 19:50.957
Yeah?

19:51.057 --> 19:52.859
Well, did you check
out the name tag?

19:52.959 --> 19:54.727
Yeah, it looks bigger.

19:54.827 --> 19:55.995
Yeah.

19:56.095 --> 19:58.097
Like, my whole uniform's
really, really big, you know,

19:58.197 --> 19:59.699
like a tent.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.602
You want to go camping, Dan?

20:02.702 --> 20:04.070
Now?

20:04.170 --> 20:06.239
Aren't you going to be late?

20:06.339 --> 20:08.174
Well, I got, like, an hour.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.176
Well, you keep
saying you're sore.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.544
Yeah.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.112
Well, I just say that, you know,
so the girls will keep doing

20:13.212 --> 20:15.348
all the crap work around here.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.916
You-- you know, come on, Dan.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.619
You know, it's
been, like, a while.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.520
I know.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.858
What's a matter?

20:25.958 --> 20:29.095
I'm not sure this
is the right time.

20:29.195 --> 20:30.697
No, no, it's the perfect time.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.131
I haven't even made the bed yet.

20:34.934 --> 20:35.735
I don't know, Roseanne.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.470
I feel kind of weird.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.638
Well, it's still me.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.776
I'm nervous, honey.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.645
Well, don't be.

20:54.887 --> 20:55.955
They're higher now.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.935
[laughs]
TOM: John.

21:09.035 --> 21:09.869
Hey, Tom.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.103
- Hey, great show.
- Hey, thanks.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.439
Good.
Hey, listen.

21:12.539 --> 21:13.506
How'd that one scene go?

21:13.606 --> 21:14.474
Which one's that?

21:14.574 --> 21:15.875
You know, the
one in the kitchen.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.044
It was like you and Rosie, and
it was kind of a romantic deal.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.546
- Oh, you didn't see it?
- No.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.147
No, I had a phone call
in my dressing room,

21:21.247 --> 21:22.114
and I go in there to get it.

21:22.214 --> 21:23.049
It's so weird.

21:23.149 --> 21:24.317
And there's, like,
no phone call,

21:24.417 --> 21:25.552
and then the door
was jammed, and I

21:25.652 --> 21:27.286
couldn't even get out of there.
- Oh, that is weird.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.220
Yeah.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.622
So did you do it
like I suggested?

21:29.722 --> 21:31.458
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I played
it real nervous and everything.

21:31.558 --> 21:32.792
And then she breaks me down.

21:32.892 --> 21:33.926
In the end, we-- we shake hands.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.027
- Cool.
- Yeah.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.863
No, I think everybody
agrees with you, Tom.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.065
A simple platonic
gesture just says it all.

21:39.165 --> 21:39.966
Cool.

21:40.066 --> 21:40.867
Later.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.301
Thanks.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.404
I love being a producer.
