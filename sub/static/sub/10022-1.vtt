WEBVTT

03:09.975 --> 03:13.455
Uh, Janine? I wonder if you could
tell me, how long I might have to wait.

03:13.679 --> 03:16.167
Because I left Aunt Ruth at home
in charge of Dad and I'm just...

03:16.349 --> 03:19.698
You'll have to see Dr. Wally.
Dr. Surabh is on vacation.

03:19.921 --> 03:22.605
See Doctor who?

03:32.535 --> 03:34.422
I'll be right back.

03:34.572 --> 03:39.209
I suppose I should tell you
needles bother me a little.

03:39.475 --> 03:42.672
All right, Augustina,
could I have your arm, please?

03:43.982 --> 03:45.640
Do you mind
if I call you Augustina?

03:45.784 --> 03:48.751
Well, my name is Bessie.
Bessie! Of course. I'm sorry.

03:48.987 --> 03:51.704
It's been a bit hectic
around here.

03:51.890 --> 03:55.054
Now, where'd I... where did i put
the what chama call it?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.782
The tourniquet?
Yeah, that's it.

03:57.996 --> 03:58.857
Uh...

04:02.101 --> 04:03.661
Oh, I'm sitting on it.

04:03.803 --> 04:06.553
Usually Dr Surabh
handles the patients.

04:08.609 --> 04:10.365
Uh, okay. But I'm
a very good pathologist.

04:10.511 --> 04:13.827
I bring my father Marvin and my aunt
Ruth in quite a bit to see Dr. Surabh.

04:14.082 --> 04:17.497
Yes, I think I've seen your father
in the front. He's a very frail man?

04:17.719 --> 04:21.166
Dad's a bone You could snap him like
a twig. I hope they're all right.

04:21.591 --> 04:24.439
Oh, well, they're fine.
Good.

04:25.463 --> 04:27.405
Yeah, except Dad's dying.
He's been dying for about 20years.

04:27.565 --> 04:30.664
He's don't real slow
so i don't miss a thing, and...

04:30.869 --> 04:34.731
Well, Dr. Surabh, he's really
worked a miracle with Aunt Ruth.

04:34.972 --> 04:37.820
You know, she's had constant pain from
her back since the time she was born.

04:38.645 --> 04:42.257
But, but he had her get this, um,
electronic anesthetizer, you know?

04:42.514 --> 04:44.554
Where you put the wires
right to your brain,

04:44.716 --> 04:47.237
and any time she has a bad pain...

04:47.453 --> 04:49.276
she just turns the dial.
That's wonderful.

04:49.423 --> 04:54.987
Of course any time she uses it,
our automatic garage door goes up.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.804
But that's a small price to pay.
Oh, I agree

04:58.066 --> 04:59.659
Are those all for me?

05:00.001 --> 05:02.751
Dr. Surabh gave me
very specific instructions.

05:05.142 --> 05:08.590
Okay.
That seems like a lot of blood.

05:08.810 --> 05:11.266
If it seems like a lot of blood
that's because it is a lot of blood,

05:11.480 --> 05:13.269
so what you're feeling
is perfectly normal.

05:13.416 --> 05:16.002
Why don't we get this
over with?

05:17.354 --> 05:19.493
This is sealed so it's sterile.

05:21.292 --> 05:22.983
Oh...

05:24.863 --> 05:27.001
I think I'm gonna come back later.

05:27.166 --> 05:30.265
It's just a vitamin deficiency,
right? So, I'm just...

05:30.466 --> 05:33.565
I said it might be
a vitamin deficiency.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.228
Come on!

07:40.150 --> 07:43.281
Good evening. Bruno's
Hold please.

07:43.487 --> 07:45.430
Lee!
What?

07:45.586 --> 07:48.074
Telephone.
Mmm, okay...

07:49.724 --> 07:52.375
It feels so hard.

07:53.695 --> 07:55.768
Don't touch it.

07:55.965 --> 07:59.260
There's no reason to be putting your hands in
your hair unless you're a very nervous person.

07:59.502 --> 08:01.477
There's no reason to be nervous,
ever,

08:01.671 --> 08:03.526
so long as you have a good,
positive mental attitude.

08:10.882 --> 08:13.021
Switch.

08:14.517 --> 08:16.274
Quietly.

08:16.420 --> 08:18.110
Yeah.

08:19.825 --> 08:21.167
Yeah?

08:27.201 --> 08:31.292
Excuse me. Where do you...
Where do you take, uh...

08:31.672 --> 08:33.876
Hey, where's your brother?

08:34.042 --> 08:36.049
He started it!

08:45.022 --> 08:46.364
Hey!

09:00.507 --> 09:04.500
When we heard what happened,
it just broke our hearts!

09:10.116 --> 09:13.498
You can... make it your own
until you get on your feet.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.801
Do you have any relatives?

09:22.966 --> 09:25.584
No. Well, my boys.

09:25.767 --> 09:29.444
No relatives. That can be a blessing.

09:30.206 --> 09:33.436
No, no! Please, Lance, don't! Don't!

09:35.213 --> 09:37.733
No, Lance, don't!

09:37.915 --> 09:41.396
Stop! I'm warning you! Don't! No...

09:43.055 --> 09:45.476
You disgust me.

09:45.658 --> 09:47.382
We didn't make love.

09:47.526 --> 09:51.301
We had sex... like animals.

09:51.531 --> 09:53.670
Like pets!

09:58.040 --> 10:00.014
Hi, honey...

10:00.175 --> 10:03.854
Lance just raped Coral.
I am so surprised,

10:04.043 --> 10:08.004
because Coral just performed
the surgery on him...

10:08.415 --> 10:09.950
that got his sight back.
Coral's the doctor?

10:10.050 --> 10:13.247
Has been for weeks now.
And does that ever make Amber jealous.

10:13.554 --> 10:17.067
Did you give Dad his 2:00?

10:17.259 --> 10:20.674
I was going to.
Ruth.

10:21.698 --> 10:24.731
I asked you to do one little thing!

10:27.936 --> 10:29.398
Oh... Dad!

10:29.506 --> 10:32.026
All right, all right. Open.

10:32.242 --> 10:34.609
Open up. Open up.

10:35.780 --> 10:38.814
Oh, you sucked all the ink
off the Yhatzee dice.

10:38.983 --> 10:41.471
How are we gonna play?
Huh, Dad?

10:41.686 --> 10:45.002
All right, all right, come on.
Are you okay, huh?

10:47.293 --> 10:49.660
Ah, is this his 1:00? Hmm?

10:50.163 --> 10:52.105
Stupid me!

10:52.298 --> 10:54.371
I'm so useless!

10:54.536 --> 10:57.765
No, you're not! All right, now come on.
Let's quit hogging the bed.

10:57.970 --> 11:00.977
Come on!
It's my cure.

11:01.141 --> 11:03.988
You used to blame your pain for
everything, and now you blame your cure.

11:04.179 --> 11:06.514
Come on, open.
That's right, good.

11:08.116 --> 11:10.287
Come on, open.
Bessie, what happened to your arm?

11:10.453 --> 11:13.769
Oh, the doctor took a little blood.
It looks so tender.

11:13.991 --> 11:18.247
Shouldn't you see a doctor? I just came
from the doctor. I have a vitamin deficiency.

11:18.464 --> 11:22.325
You don't make stinky often enough.
I do so!

11:22.568 --> 11:25.667
Stinky is poison.
You have to get rid of it.

11:25.872 --> 11:29.865
That's why when you're constipated,
you have a headache.

11:30.144 --> 11:33.657
Ruth, he has to have his pills
at the same time every day!

11:33.881 --> 11:35.954
You usually give Marvin
his pills.

11:36.150 --> 11:37.939
But today I asked you to!

11:38.085 --> 11:40.867
I wish you wouldn't
leave me home alone.

11:41.055 --> 11:44.055
What if he tries to kill himself
with his Par cheesi men?

11:44.258 --> 11:46.200
Dr. Surabh explained this to you.

11:46.361 --> 11:49.329
He puts things in his mouth
because he likes the way they feel.

11:49.565 --> 11:53.940
What if he dies
while you're out of the house?

11:55.036 --> 11:58.353
Then you'll call me,
and I'll come home.

11:58.542 --> 12:00.429
Oh.
All right?

12:01.245 --> 12:03.863
Do you want me to make
the tomato soup?

12:03.981 --> 12:07.145
No, you' re just going
to make a mess of it

12:07.352 --> 12:10.669
I'll get you one of my vitamin pills
for your deficiency.

12:10.890 --> 12:13.345
I'll get some real ones later.

12:13.526 --> 12:17.355
Mine are real.
Do you want Pebbles or BammBamm?

12:17.597 --> 12:19.223
Mmm.

12:22.503 --> 12:24.162
Oh, no! Oh. Dad!

12:25.007 --> 12:28.269
Oh. Oh! Oh!

12:32.949 --> 12:34.771
Wait a second. Okay, okay, I know.

12:34.885 --> 12:39.140
Let me do this for you, all right?

12:39.423 --> 12:43.220
Look what I got, Dad.
Look at that.

12:46.965 --> 12:48.908
Look at that, Dad.
See? Isn't that nice?

12:49.034 --> 12:52.008
Is it nice, Dad?

12:52.171 --> 12:56.132
What?
What do you see there?

12:59.844 --> 13:05.409
Is that the Northern Lights there?
Uh-huh, over there?

13:05.886 --> 13:08.221
Okay, Dad.

13:12.894 --> 13:14.269
Now,

13:15.598 --> 13:20.038
I got you some carrots
and some butternut squash.

13:20.303 --> 13:24.784
Well, all right.
Then, how bout some tomato soup?

13:25.011 --> 13:26.952
And some juice?

13:27.177 --> 13:30.441
And what does that face mean,

13:30.617 --> 13:34.774
Mr. Innocent, huh?

13:41.428 --> 13:43.184
You mind if I smoke?

13:43.329 --> 13:46.591
Yes.
Thank you for asking.

13:46.835 --> 13:50.217
How bout if i blow it
out this way?

13:50.438 --> 13:53.057
I'm afraid there's no smoking
anywhere on this floor.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.629
Okay, okay, I'll be real quiet.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.658
It's good to see you here, Lee.

14:02.818 --> 14:05.785
May I call you Lee?
Sure.

14:06.023 --> 14:08.357
We've missed you on other days.
So has Hank.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.149
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

14:11.428 --> 14:14.745
The... I wish I could
visit more often, but...

14:15.601 --> 14:18.089
Mm... hmm...
You know.

14:22.507 --> 14:25.890
You're not a nurse are you?
I'm a psychiatrist.

14:26.112 --> 14:29.210
So you're the one that Hank talks to.
I'm in charge of his therapy.

14:30.216 --> 14:32.637
Well, you know he lies.

14:32.853 --> 14:34.740
Mm... hmm...

14:35.355 --> 14:38.519
He told his guidance counselor
at school that I beat him.

14:38.756 --> 14:40.895
Mm... hmm...

14:41.059 --> 14:43.295
So, see what I mean?

14:43.463 --> 14:45.056
Mm... hmm...

14:46.765 --> 14:49.384
Oh!

14:49.569 --> 14:52.503
So. See, now you're thinking,
I wounder if she does beat him.

14:52.707 --> 14:56.352
Is that what you think I think?
Don't you?

14:56.577 --> 14:59.446
Do you want me to think that?
What do you mean?

14:59.681 --> 15:03.478
What do you think I mean? What do
you mean. What do I think you mean?

15:03.752 --> 15:06.535
What do you think I mean
by What do you think I mean?

15:07.623 --> 15:10.722
We'd like for you to become
more involved in Hank's therapy.

15:10.894 --> 15:13.764
We'd like for you to come
more often for visits.

15:13.964 --> 15:17.380
Doctor, can I be honest
with you?

15:17.602 --> 15:21.693
I have forced my way through
school, and I'm about to get my degree.

15:21.941 --> 15:25.836
And I'm very picky now
about the kind of guy I'll do with.

15:26.078 --> 15:31.163
And I ke... I used to keep
a really clean house.

15:31.486 --> 15:34.835
Hank makes fun of
my degree in cosmetology.

15:35.088 --> 15:37.357
He terrorizes any guy
I go out with.

15:37.523 --> 15:40.768
This last one, Lawrence,
Hank made fun of his being on parole.

15:40.943 --> 15:44.154
He made fun of how he holds his liquor.
He made fun of his Pinto.

15:44.365 --> 15:48.973
The point is, Hank cost me
a potentially good relationship.

15:49.206 --> 15:51.409
And as for my house...

15:55.680 --> 15:59.291
Hank is not something
I can control.

16:00.384 --> 16:02.686
So what's the point
of my visiting?

16:02.854 --> 16:04.959
He says he misses you

16:06.893 --> 16:11.301
Well, I'm here.
So let me see him.

16:15.903 --> 16:18.140
You want one?
No, thank you.

16:36.193 --> 16:38.200
Hi, Hank. It's Mom.

16:38.395 --> 16:40.850
Can you hear me?

16:42.567 --> 16:45.284
Okay, well, um...

16:47.806 --> 16:50.653
You be good. I... I'll leave you
some of these here...

16:50.843 --> 16:53.232
so when you wake up
you can have them waiting.

16:56.679 --> 16:58.370
You sure you...
No, no, thanks.

16:58.514 --> 17:01.449
Okay, well, uh, I'll see ya.

17:05.522 --> 17:08.141
Does this count as a visit?

17:08.359 --> 17:10.847
Do you think this counts
as a visit?

17:25.612 --> 17:30.249
Uh. Excuse me. Oh, uh, don't be
surprised if Dr. Wally is late.

17:30.518 --> 17:33.235
He was an 11-month baby.
Can you imagine that?

17:33.420 --> 17:35.809
I, on the other hand,
I... I was premature.

17:35.992 --> 17:38.064
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
I got stuck at the hospital.

17:38.226 --> 17:41.456
Oh, you must be very busy.
I wanted to check on your tests.

17:41.664 --> 17:45.177
I was telling her that I weighed one
pound when I was born. No, you didn't Bob.

17:45.402 --> 17:47.474
I, I was this big.
Oh.

17:47.671 --> 17:51.054
Follow me.
Fo... Not you, Bob.

17:51.309 --> 17:53.349
Follow me.

17:57.082 --> 17:59.057
So, how are we today?

18:00.152 --> 18:01.908
You tell me.

18:10.098 --> 18:12.520
Dr. Wally speaking.

18:13.101 --> 18:15.468
Yes, Bob, I know there's
someone waiting in my office.

18:15.638 --> 18:17.493
I'm in my office.

18:17.672 --> 18:19.680
That's all right.

18:19.874 --> 18:21.663
Yes. Yes.

18:24.513 --> 18:26.815
Is there a problem?
No, no, he's just neq here.

18:27.016 --> 18:28.510
He'll get the hang of it.
No, no, no, no.

18:28.651 --> 18:30.855
I meant with my blood test.
Did it get lost or something?

18:31.021 --> 18:35.364
Because... I really
was getting myself all worked up.

18:35.627 --> 18:38.627
I was thinking all kinds of horrible
thoughts. No, it didn't get lost.

18:38.830 --> 18:40.837
But what I would like to do is...

18:41.000 --> 18:43.422
run some other tests simply to
rule out certain possibilities.

18:43.636 --> 18:45.327
What are the possibilities?

18:45.471 --> 18:48.089
There are a number
I would like to rule out.

18:48.274 --> 18:51.853
Are we still thinking I have a vitamin
deficiency? We may have ruled out that.

18:52.112 --> 18:55.309
Do you think we should? Should we have
ruled that out? No reason to be nervous.

18:55.516 --> 18:57.115
I'm not nervous.
Good!

18:57.218 --> 19:00.120
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
give you a local anesthetic...

19:00.322 --> 19:03.105
and I'm going to remove a little
bone marrow from your hip.

19:03.325 --> 19:04.787
What?

19:05.794 --> 19:08.828
I don't mean to be noisy,
but what is the test for?

19:08.966 --> 19:11.551
Why don't you let me
do the worrying for now?

19:11.799 --> 19:15.727
I'm probably thinking it's something
much worse than it actually is.

19:16.539 --> 19:20.248
Is it something serious,
like a brain tumor?

19:20.477 --> 19:22.419
Oh, no.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.880
M. S?
No!

19:25.081 --> 19:27.023
Cancer?

19:28.986 --> 19:33.362
Well, one of the possibilities
I was hoping to rule out is leukemia.

19:34.993 --> 19:36.967
My mother had...

19:38.797 --> 19:42.059
I know.
I saw that in your file.

19:49.342 --> 19:51.481
Hold all my calls, please.

19:55.884 --> 19:57.858
Bessie, I just...

20:02.925 --> 20:05.030
Dr. Wally speaking.

20:05.226 --> 20:08.423
Yes, that was me just then.
Didn't you recognize my voice, Bob?

20:09.464 --> 20:11.253
That's all right.

20:13.002 --> 20:15.752
That's what I get
for hiring my own brother.

20:16.405 --> 20:19.471
I haven't been feeling as badly lately,
haven't been nearly as tired.

20:19.675 --> 20:22.709
Why don't you lie on your side
and face the wall,

20:22.915 --> 20:25.403
and we'll get this over
as soon as we can?

20:32.693 --> 20:34.351
What does it mean
if it is leukemia?

20:36.964 --> 20:39.135
There are a variety
of leukemias...

20:39.334 --> 20:41.406
and a variety of treatments.

20:41.569 --> 20:45.760
If you have, for example,
chronic myelogenous leukemia,

20:46.007 --> 20:48.974
a bone marrow transplant
is a very real option.

20:49.213 --> 20:52.180
We would then test members
of your family for possible donors.

20:52.415 --> 20:55.229
You do have family.
Dad and Ruth.

20:55.418 --> 20:59.858
I thought your file mentioned a sister.
Oh, yes, I do. I...

21:00.124 --> 21:02.710
I have a sister Lee. Yes...

21:02.892 --> 21:04.234
Good.

21:06.364 --> 21:08.186
Oh!

21:31.125 --> 21:35.380
I just had it done last week
and it's driving me crazy!

21:35.631 --> 21:38.217
Do you think God's
punishing me for vanity,

21:38.401 --> 21:40.157
or is it always that way?

21:40.303 --> 21:43.118
Oh, my God! If you have
a permanent done right,

21:43.307 --> 21:45.162
it shouldn't itch you at all!

21:45.309 --> 21:49.276
Convent.

21:49.547 --> 21:52.198
Sister...
Lee Lacker, please.

21:52.984 --> 21:56.432
Sister Lee Lacker, telephone!

22:06.232 --> 22:10.926
Hello?

22:11.237 --> 22:13.790
Hello!
Lee?

22:13.974 --> 22:16.560
Hello?
Hi, it's me... Bessie.

22:16.743 --> 22:18.950
Bessie?

22:19.079 --> 22:21.414
What's wrong?

22:24.587 --> 22:26.594
Mm... hmm.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.246
Uh... huh.

22:36.266 --> 22:38.437
They had reservations
about letting Hank go at all.

22:38.605 --> 22:40.710
A week was all
we could get approval for.

22:40.906 --> 22:43.110
Yeah, but if one of us
is a match, then we gotta...

22:43.275 --> 22:45.283
We'll deal with that then.

22:47.514 --> 22:49.017
Hey

22:49.116 --> 22:53.175
Look at you. You look like a pig.
I'm working on an engine.

22:53.419 --> 22:55.274
So they don't let you shower?

22:55.421 --> 22:58.007
Look, they told me you were here
so I came, all right?

23:01.562 --> 23:03.450
You behaving yourself?

23:03.597 --> 23:06.466
They're not strapping
me down anymore.

23:06.701 --> 23:10.116
Well, don't abuse that privilege.

23:10.339 --> 23:12.248
So. How come
you're visiting me?

23:12.441 --> 23:14.416
What do you mean?
I don't need a reason to visit.

23:14.578 --> 23:17.392
How come you never visited before?
I did. You were unconscious.

23:17.614 --> 23:20.516
How can that be a visit if I didn't even know
you were here? I can't take responsibility...

23:20.717 --> 23:23.336
for when you're conscious or unconscious,
all can do is make the effort.

23:23.521 --> 23:26.008
Your mother has something to tell you
It's not good news.

23:29.559 --> 23:35.091
But Doctor says it's okay to tell you
because, partially, I have no choice.

23:37.136 --> 23:38.795
What?

23:38.971 --> 23:42.452
Your Aunt Bessie down in Florida
has leukemia. She's not doing so well.

23:42.677 --> 23:44.586
There's a possibility
she might die.

23:44.745 --> 23:48.706
I didn't know I had an Aunt Bessie!
She's been to the house.

23:48.947 --> 23:51.664
When?
Right after your dad and I got married.

23:51.850 --> 23:53.673
Mom, I wasn't born yet.

23:53.852 --> 23:57.464
Look, I know I mentioned her to you. She's
my sister! I didn't know you had a sister.

23:57.690 --> 24:00.407
You know how every goddamn
Christmas I say to you,

24:00.594 --> 24:03.725
Looks like Bessie didn't send
a card again this year either?

24:03.931 --> 24:07.706
Oh, yeah.
That's your Aunt Bessie. My sister.

24:07.935 --> 24:10.172
And because we're her nearest relatives,
they want us to get tested...

24:10.340 --> 24:13.885
cause maybe they could save her life
and do a bone marrow transplant or...

24:14.109 --> 24:16.157
It's only for a week.
Doctor says it's okay to go.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.134
Why would want to go?

24:21.185 --> 24:23.324
Because one of us
might save her life.

24:25.590 --> 24:29.365
Go, go, go, get cleaned up. I'm not
gonna take you like that in the car.

24:30.129 --> 24:34.766
Hank, isn't there something you anna
say to your mother before you leave?

24:35.034 --> 24:37.555
But is this gonna take long?
Because we should go.

24:37.739 --> 24:39.713
Mom?

24:40.675 --> 24:43.806
I'm really sorry
I burnt the house down.

24:48.115 --> 24:53.265
Is that it? Because I'm really
anxious now to get on the road.

25:15.648 --> 25:19.292
Oop, no matches.
Mom, I gotta light the thing. Come on.

25:19.519 --> 25:22.486
Charlie, here,
light this for him please.

25:45.247 --> 25:49.720
Being confined to your bed
is nothing to be afraid of.

25:49.953 --> 25:54.393
I'm not confined to my bed.
I'm just... I'm a little tired today.

25:54.659 --> 25:59.296
I was confined to my bed most
of my life. You find things to do.

25:59.565 --> 26:02.533
Like what?
Oh!

26:03.769 --> 26:05.941
Well, uh, you can sleep.

26:06.137 --> 26:08.624
Or you can lay there awake.

26:09.775 --> 26:11.531
Uh... huh.
Ah, do you want any of this?

26:11.742 --> 26:16.347
Oh, no, no, no. You must eat
all of that to make yourself strong.

26:17.216 --> 26:18.972
How's Dad?

26:19.119 --> 26:21.127
Oh, he's fine.

26:22.455 --> 26:25.008
Do you want your orange?
No, no, you can have it.

26:25.225 --> 26:27.844
Well, no,
not if you're going...

26:28.029 --> 26:29.556
Thank you.

26:29.730 --> 26:32.251
Does he miss me?

26:32.466 --> 26:37.355
Well, I haven't actually
told him you're gone.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.582
What? Doesn't he wonder where I am?
Well, I tell him...

26:39.975 --> 26:43.423
you're just in the other room
busy with something.

26:43.612 --> 26:48.217
And then he falls asleep and when he
wakes up I say, he just missed you.

26:48.485 --> 26:50.867
Who does he think
that nurse is living with you?

26:51.004 --> 26:53.353
I pretend not to notice her.
What do you mean?

26:53.524 --> 26:56.110
If she walks in the room
while I'm there,

26:56.328 --> 26:59.557
I pretend she's not real,
that she doesn't exist.

26:59.764 --> 27:02.546
Then what does Dad think?

27:02.767 --> 27:06.957
I think he thinks
he's hallucinating.

27:07.207 --> 27:09.476
Ruth, you have to tell him.

27:09.643 --> 27:12.098
The only time it seems
to bother him...

27:12.279 --> 27:15.410
is when she carries him
to the bath and then I say,

27:15.618 --> 27:20.802
Oh, Marvin, look, you're flying!
Bessie'll wanna see this!

27:21.059 --> 27:23.808
And I run into
the other room to get you.

27:23.993 --> 27:25.880
He must think
he's losing his mind!

27:26.062 --> 27:28.910
What am I supposed
to tell him?

27:29.465 --> 27:31.287
That... that
his little girl is...

27:31.402 --> 27:34.249
Oh, I'm...

27:34.437 --> 27:37.437
Then he'd really think
he was losing his mind.

27:37.675 --> 27:40.937
He'd be so upset.
It would be so upsetting to him.

27:41.146 --> 27:43.863
He's your father
All right, Ruth, all right.

27:44.049 --> 27:46.438
I wouldn't know
what to say.

27:48.320 --> 27:50.873
Here. Here, here.

27:56.263 --> 27:58.980
Just tell him
I'm gonna be fine, Ruth.

27:59.168 --> 28:01.077
I know I am.

28:01.836 --> 28:03.746
See?

28:05.074 --> 28:06.896
That's okay. Sure.

28:07.009 --> 28:08.983
Okay?

28:11.181 --> 28:12.839
What's Grandpa like?

28:12.983 --> 28:16.366
I don't know,
Charlie. It's been a while.

28:16.587 --> 28:18.954
Why haven't we seen him before?
He's been sick. We were in Ohio.

28:19.224 --> 28:23.381
It's hard to travel with little kids.
I don't know.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.415
What's Bessie like?

28:30.101 --> 28:32.239
I don't know.

28:32.403 --> 28:35.719
This is the first time
I even heard from her in 20 years.

28:35.941 --> 28:38.243
Why haven't you
heard from her in 20 years.

28:38.410 --> 28:42.469
I couldn't help her when
Dad got sick. I guess she got mad at me.

28:42.714 --> 28:44.754
Why?
Jesus, Charlie!

28:45.251 --> 28:47.193
Shut up! Read your book.

29:03.439 --> 29:06.341
Have you ever heard of Larry Lacker?
Who?

29:06.542 --> 29:10.503
My dad. He's like the greatest
race car driver ever.

29:10.779 --> 29:13.976
No, I never, uh...
I never heard of Larry Lacker.

29:14.183 --> 29:15.841
No?

29:19.922 --> 29:21.711
Those guys know Dad.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.449
Hi

29:32.871 --> 29:34.464
Bessie!

29:54.530 --> 29:56.864
Come on, let's go.
Hey, I was listening to that.

29:57.034 --> 29:58.627
Let's go.

30:01.070 --> 30:02.958
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

30:16.288 --> 30:17.979
Hello?

30:23.963 --> 30:25.970
Bessie?

30:30.004 --> 30:31.083
Lee?

30:40.083 --> 30:42.025
Oh!

30:44.689 --> 30:47.885
Oh... God.

30:48.092 --> 30:51.224
What are you staring at?

30:51.829 --> 30:55.125
Well, oh, my, my goodness,
oh. My goodness! Oh, look at you.

30:55.334 --> 30:57.603
What?
Oh, just look at you!

30:57.770 --> 31:00.356
Oh. God, are you that old?

31:00.540 --> 31:04.316
Cause how old does that make me then?
Why, I look old?

31:04.514 --> 31:06.073
Well...

31:06.213 --> 31:09.857
Oh, you're a lot... Well, you're
a lot older, but... Yeah, well.

31:10.617 --> 31:13.879
Well, you look
really good though, Bessie.

31:14.089 --> 31:16.161
You do! I like your hair.

31:16.358 --> 31:20.417
This is a wig.
It's, uh, It's from my chemo.

31:20.663 --> 31:24.885
Oh!
Yeah, it... well...

31:25.134 --> 31:28.232
I know it's a wig.
I don't know why I pretended not to.

31:28.471 --> 31:31.373
Not that it looks like a wig.
No, I mean...

31:31.575 --> 31:33.397
Thanks.

31:33.511 --> 31:36.577
Hey, I'm wearing a fall, Look. See?
Mm... hmm...

31:36.781 --> 31:39.399
I always loved this length,
but I never had the patience for it.

31:39.618 --> 31:42.717
I just... wear it when I want to
look really great.

31:43.822 --> 31:46.211
You look good though.

31:47.327 --> 31:48.985
Thank you.

31:51.166 --> 31:52.824
Why don't you sit down?

31:52.933 --> 31:56.512
I gotta put these to soak.
Dad had himself a little accident.

31:56.739 --> 31:58.844
Oh! How is he?

31:59.008 --> 32:01.725
Oh, he's still with us.

32:01.910 --> 32:04.430
Let me help.
Oh, no... no, no... no, no.

32:04.613 --> 32:07.647
You sure?
No, I've been doing it this long.

32:29.909 --> 32:34.863
Daddy, it's me. Lee.

32:35.149 --> 32:38.018
All the way down from Ohio.

33:20.931 --> 33:23.004
Lee, I don't know if you
should smoke in the house.

33:23.201 --> 33:25.119
Oh...
Dad's oxygen tanks.

33:25.235 --> 33:29.097
But you could smoke in the yard.
I don't have to smoke.

33:30.009 --> 33:33.176
Ooh, look who it is!

33:33.346 --> 33:38.267
Aunt Ruth, you're up and about.
Oh, it's my cure. I'm part machine.

33:40.421 --> 33:43.104
Give me a hug!
Oh!

33:43.324 --> 33:46.969
Oh, give me a real hug!
I won't break.

33:49.399 --> 33:51.766
Oh, oh, Jesus, sweet Jesus!

34:01.110 --> 34:03.118
Oh! Oh, that's much better.

34:03.279 --> 34:05.253
Oh.
Yes, uh...

34:05.416 --> 34:07.871
I brought cookies!
Oh, thanks, Lee.

34:08.052 --> 34:11.915
Oh, Dad and Ruth aren't allowed sugar
and I'm trying to stay away from it too.

34:12.156 --> 34:15.320
But this is just
a lovely canister.

34:15.527 --> 34:18.562
Oh, I'm missing my program.

34:18.764 --> 34:20.620
Oh!

34:20.766 --> 34:23.801
Yeah, you go watch
your program.

34:24.405 --> 34:26.478
Where are your boys?

34:26.641 --> 34:29.389
Couldn't you get Hank out
of the mental institution?

34:29.610 --> 34:33.025
Bessie, we don't like to call it the mental
institution. Oh, what do you call it then?

34:33.248 --> 34:37.592
We call it the nuthouse or loony bin to
show we have a sense of humor about it.

34:37.853 --> 34:39.741
Well, where is he?
Where's Charlie?

34:39.889 --> 34:42.344
I got myself two grown nephews
I've never even seen.

34:42.527 --> 34:46.268
Now, I did invite you up to Ohio for
both of their christenings. Remember?

34:46.496 --> 34:49.398
They're sitting in the car.

34:49.599 --> 34:51.966
The car?

34:55.407 --> 34:58.985
Bessie, Hank will do things
like this just to get attention.

34:59.211 --> 35:02.506
They say I should just ignore it,
or give him an ultimatum.

35:02.749 --> 35:05.270
He hasn't agreed to be tested
for the transplant yet...

35:05.453 --> 35:07.722
because he knows it'll make him
the center of attention.

35:07.887 --> 35:10.887
He hasn't?
No, Don't worry. He will.

35:11.126 --> 35:13.264
I'll make him...
if I have to.

35:13.458 --> 35:16.720
How are you gonna make him?
You can't make him come in from the car.

35:25.972 --> 35:29.288
Hey, you two! Charlie!
Hank, what the hell are you doing?

35:29.510 --> 35:32.707
I wanna hear number one. They're doin a top
100 countdown and I wanna hear number one.

35:32.947 --> 35:35.314
Well, what number are they on now?
Eighty-six!

35:40.423 --> 35:42.146
You get out here right now.

35:42.356 --> 35:44.593
I'm warning you!
You get outta the car right now!

35:44.860 --> 35:47.610
Do you hear me?

35:55.506 --> 35:57.873
Hi, I'm your Aunt Bessie,
who you never laid eyes on,

35:58.042 --> 36:01.839
and I don't care how grown-up you are,
I expect a big, fat hug.

36:06.652 --> 36:08.507
Oh!

36:09.021 --> 36:11.672
Oh!

36:13.261 --> 36:16.228
Oh, no, you must be Charlie!
Huh? Well, hi.

36:16.430 --> 36:19.398
Look who's here.
Look who's here!

36:19.634 --> 36:22.766
Hank, Charlie, this is your aunt Ruth.
Come on, say hello.

36:22.973 --> 36:28.188
All right, now which of you handsome
boys is in the mental institution?

36:28.478 --> 36:30.715
Oh.

36:30.881 --> 36:33.303
Give me a hug!

36:36.220 --> 36:39.002
Well, would you all like to see Dad?

36:39.190 --> 36:41.710
I know he's so excited about
meeting everybody. Yeah, sure.

36:41.892 --> 36:45.405
Let me get him ready. I know
he wants to make a good impression.

36:47.799 --> 36:51.028
Marvin, company's coming.
Company's coming.

36:51.237 --> 36:54.466
Come, come. Oh, Marvin!

37:10.160 --> 37:11.883
Well...

37:13.295 --> 37:15.685
Dad? Dad?

37:15.866 --> 37:18.419
This is Lee, your daughter.

37:18.603 --> 37:21.571
And there's Charlie,
right there.

37:21.806 --> 37:23.694
You see him? Yeah!

37:23.841 --> 37:26.143
And, and...

37:26.346 --> 37:28.069
Hank!

37:28.214 --> 37:30.735
Your grandsons!

37:43.662 --> 37:44.971
Hi.

37:45.098 --> 37:47.112
It's okay, Dad.
Hank didn't mean anything.

37:47.233 --> 37:50.881
I didn't mean to do...
He's just not used to a lot of people.

37:51.072 --> 37:53.822
What did you do?
I didn't do anything. I said hello.

37:53.976 --> 37:56.015
Maybe we should just
clear out of here.

38:00.780 --> 38:02.788
Just give him a second!
Lee?

38:26.209 --> 38:28.736
Hey, did your Aunt Bessie
offer you a chip yet?

38:28.879 --> 38:32.108
Well, that's what they're there for.
Yeah, but he has to wait to be asked.

38:32.383 --> 38:33.976
Put the chip back, Hank.

38:38.290 --> 38:40.329
Put it back.

38:48.636 --> 38:50.644
Put back the chip!

38:50.772 --> 38:52.976
Lee, I put them out there
for the kids.

38:53.141 --> 38:56.207
You have to understand.
He has to wait to be asked.

38:59.550 --> 39:01.688
Hank, would you like a chip?

39:01.851 --> 39:03.957
No, thank you, Aunt Bessie,
not right now.

39:04.121 --> 39:08.049
Your aunt offered you a chip. Now the
polite thing to do would be to take one.

39:08.293 --> 39:11.204
I don't want a chip right now.
Eat or no Disney World!

39:11.362 --> 39:14.362
I could give a fuck about Disney World!
That's it, get out! Out, out!

39:14.565 --> 39:18.013
I don't care where.
Just so I can't see you.

39:22.607 --> 39:25.673
Charlie,
would you like a chip?

39:28.015 --> 39:32.423
Go ahead, honey, if you want one.
Oh, take a bunch.

39:32.718 --> 39:35.271
Not too many.
You don't want to ruin your supper.

39:39.995 --> 39:43.126
And don't get any crumbs on
your aunt's nice, clean floor.

40:06.459 --> 40:08.564
No, no, no! No, Lance.

40:08.728 --> 40:10.288
No!

40:10.463 --> 40:16.093
Not Amber, No!
No, Lance, that's Amber! No!

40:16.437 --> 40:19.753
No, no, no, no.
Shh, shh.

40:19.973 --> 40:23.238
No, Lance, that's Amber.

40:23.413 --> 40:25.202
No. No.

40:25.381 --> 40:29.210
No, no, no.

41:57.854 --> 42:00.407
I'm not used to finding
somebody else out here.

42:00.656 --> 42:04.039
Sorry. You want me to go back inside?
No! No. Unless...

42:04.261 --> 42:07.461
Are you not supposed to be out
here? Will your mother care? Nah.

42:07.630 --> 42:11.753
She's asleep.
I don't see any harm in it.

42:13.635 --> 42:15.740
We're all really glad
you're here.

42:15.904 --> 42:19.482
Yeah. We should do it again
in, like, another 17 years.

42:20.744 --> 42:23.507
Well, your mom and I
haven't always gotten along.

42:23.660 --> 42:26.390
That's... why I haven't
been in touch so much.

42:26.584 --> 42:28.406
Uh... huh.

42:28.587 --> 42:32.362
I wish you could have really
known your grandfather.

42:32.591 --> 42:35.526
He would have loved
havin a boy around.

42:35.728 --> 42:38.445
Do you ever wish
he'd just die?

42:38.632 --> 42:41.632
Hank, don't ask that!
Why not?

42:41.835 --> 42:44.169
Cause... it's rude.

42:47.810 --> 42:50.974
You know, I haven't made up my mind
about gettin tested yet.

42:52.448 --> 42:54.455
Okay.

42:54.650 --> 42:57.333
What are you doing
with those tools?

42:57.520 --> 42:59.462
Oh, I was just lookin' at'em.
I'll put'em back.

42:59.723 --> 43:03.335
I didn't think you were gonna steal'em,
Hank. You can have'em if you want.

43:04.860 --> 43:06.900
Really?

43:07.063 --> 43:10.325
Well, sure!
You're just gonna give'em to me?

43:10.567 --> 43:12.804
Sure. Why not?

43:12.969 --> 43:15.074
Wow. These are
really cool tools.

43:16.174 --> 43:18.345
Yeah. They were
your granddad's.

43:18.510 --> 43:20.550
I think he'd like you
to have them.

43:22.215 --> 43:25.191
The hospital probably
won't let me keep them anyway.

43:25.354 --> 43:27.557
Well, you're not going
to be in there forever.

43:28.623 --> 43:32.136
When i go back, they're going to
move me into a place for adults.

43:32.326 --> 43:36.101
Why?
I turn 18in, like, three weeks.

43:36.332 --> 43:38.437
Oh! Happy birthday.

43:39.568 --> 43:42.884
If the fire hadn't spread up the street,
it wouldn't be such a big deal.

43:43.106 --> 43:45.888
But now they want to make sure
I'm not some sort of a threat.

43:46.109 --> 43:48.182
Oh, you're not a threat,
and I'm sure they see that.

43:48.378 --> 43:50.800
You're probably the best one...
There's this one dude on my floor.

43:50.983 --> 43:53.404
Held a razor blade under his tongue
for, like, five hours.

43:53.585 --> 43:55.854
He talked to the orderlies,
he ate, and everything.

43:56.020 --> 43:58.158
Why on earth
would he do that?

43:58.356 --> 44:00.909
He was trying to break
my record.

44:02.428 --> 44:06.203
Hank... what do you want to be
when you grow up?

44:06.466 --> 44:08.571
I am grown-up!

44:55.452 --> 44:57.361
So Marvin liked to fix stuff?

44:57.521 --> 45:00.870
Mmh. God, he used to make
your mother so mad.

45:01.125 --> 45:03.779
He'd leave that radio lying
around the house in pieces, and,

45:03.928 --> 45:08.532
and she used to love to turn it up
and dance wild around the house.

45:08.834 --> 45:12.609
Mom liked to dance?
Oh, you bet!

45:12.872 --> 45:16.450
So, who's this right here?
What? Let me...

45:16.711 --> 45:19.045
Let me see.

45:19.212 --> 45:22.311
Oh, that's your grandmother.
She looks like Mom.

45:22.518 --> 45:25.584
Mmm, Yeah,
she takes after her.

45:25.788 --> 45:27.927
Do you want this too?

45:28.090 --> 45:32.662
No, I don't care.
No? I'm gonna keep it then.

45:34.665 --> 45:37.120
I don't think I'm gonna get the test.
What do you think about that?

45:37.301 --> 45:40.269
Can I ask why?
No reason.

45:43.275 --> 45:46.025
Maybe your mom wouldn't
want you up this late.

45:47.711 --> 45:50.526
All right.
All right.

45:53.786 --> 45:55.247
You know somethin'?

45:55.354 --> 45:57.721
Nobody ever does anything
to be nice.

45:57.924 --> 46:00.096
They always want to get somethin'
out of it. And you believe that?

46:00.294 --> 46:04.517
I mean, the first time I hear from you
is when you need somethin from me.

46:04.765 --> 46:08.181
Well, I Why do you think I spent
the last 20 years of my life down here?

46:08.436 --> 46:10.825
Because I got something out of it?
Yeah, or you wouldn't have done it.

46:11.006 --> 46:12.349
Oh, Hank!

46:12.441 --> 46:14.537
Or maybe you just wanted
to hide out for a while.

46:14.910 --> 46:16.701
Or you thought you could
never find a husband.

46:16.813 --> 46:19.660
When you're not around, a nursing home
can do this job for the cash.

46:19.850 --> 46:22.314
Your mother would never
put them in a home. Why not?

46:22.455 --> 46:24.843
She doesn't give a shit
about anybody.

46:38.539 --> 46:41.800
Um, I'm putting this
with your other things.

46:42.006 --> 46:44.212
Why?

46:44.342 --> 46:47.309
Because they're yours.

46:48.347 --> 46:51.129
Okay.
Hank,

46:52.685 --> 46:55.238
you're my nephew and I love you...

46:55.422 --> 46:58.356
no matter what you've decided.

47:00.293 --> 47:02.879
Okay.
Okay.

47:03.062 --> 47:04.949
Good night.

47:16.178 --> 47:19.212
Don't waste your time
trying to make friends with him.

47:19.449 --> 47:21.870
We're only gonna be here
a few days.

47:35.034 --> 47:38.165
Now, we are starting with
a procedure to look for a match.

47:38.403 --> 47:41.599
Please, Bob, I'll take this.

47:41.840 --> 47:45.769
Now we are starting with a procedure
to look for a match. Any questions?

47:46.012 --> 47:48.150
How big is the needle?

47:49.884 --> 47:52.348
It's not so important that you
understand the procedure, Bob.

47:52.489 --> 47:55.270
Follow me, please.

47:58.093 --> 48:01.257
Hank, are you fixing
the door for Ruth?

48:01.464 --> 48:03.985
It's so boring around here,
there's northen' else to do.

48:04.168 --> 48:06.502
Well, do you want
to keep me company?

48:06.704 --> 48:08.395
Yeah, sure.

48:12.077 --> 48:14.565
It's a Ford, huh?
Yeah.

48:14.746 --> 48:17.812
What year?
Oh! Would you like to drive, Hank?

48:18.017 --> 48:19.708
Are you sure?
Yes.

48:19.851 --> 48:23.115
You sure you want me to drive? I'm
warning' you. Okay, you can drive.

48:23.289 --> 48:26.038
'Cause I'm kinda fast I'm warnin' you
Be careful, all right?

48:26.827 --> 48:28.714
Don't drive too fast.
All right.

48:42.844 --> 48:44.917
You're a natural-born driver.

48:47.583 --> 48:51.064
Oh, I have an idea.
I know where we can go. Um, turn here.

49:00.465 --> 49:03.400
Did you know my dad?
I met him once.

49:03.704 --> 49:06.737
Doesn't your mom talk
about him?

49:06.873 --> 49:11.030
Nah. I know he had a race car, but...
Really?

49:11.278 --> 49:13.995
Well, I know your mom
was nuts about him.

49:16.551 --> 49:19.039
Did you go to the wedding?
No, uh... uh.

49:19.220 --> 49:22.536
No, I know I was gonna be down here with
Dad and Ruth for longer than I thought,

49:22.758 --> 49:26.752
so... I went back home
to sell off the rest of my stuff.

49:27.697 --> 49:30.544
They have you over for
dinner or somethin'? No.

49:30.734 --> 49:35.109
No, it wasn't much of a visit.
I just sort of stopped by.

49:35.605 --> 49:37.428
Your Dad was asleep on the couch
and Lee didn't want to wake him.

49:38.408 --> 49:42.205
So... we stood in the hallway
and we talked for a while.

49:43.447 --> 49:46.546
Your dad was still asleep
when I left.

49:47.351 --> 49:49.936
How'd he seem?

49:53.525 --> 49:55.762
Yeah, he seemed nice enough.

50:18.243 --> 50:19.650
What?

50:25.718 --> 50:27.092
Hank!

50:27.720 --> 50:29.662
Stop it, Hank! No!

50:30.822 --> 50:32.545
No! Stop! Stop!

50:32.690 --> 50:36.302
No, stop, wait!
I mean it, Hank! No, no, no!

50:48.375 --> 50:50.830
Whoo... hoo!

50:51.745 --> 50:54.428
Oh, Hank!

50:59.120 --> 51:02.055
Whoo... hoo... hoo... hoo!

51:22.877 --> 51:24.404
Oh, Lee,

51:24.479 --> 51:26.552
we were just down by the water.

51:26.716 --> 51:28.756
Oh, I'm...

51:28.919 --> 51:33.042
I'm sorry. I...
Dr. Wally called.

51:33.323 --> 51:34.666
Oh.

51:34.757 --> 51:38.554
He would like to test
the boys next.

51:57.450 --> 51:59.687
What's wrong, Dad?
Dad, what's wrong?

51:59.854 --> 52:04.044
No, no, no. No, Dad, it's just us.
It's just, it's just us.

52:04.291 --> 52:07.193
It's just us! Oh, Dad!

52:11.599 --> 52:14.632
Oh, no, Dad, there's
nothing to be afraid of.

52:14.869 --> 52:16.843
Hey, Hank.

52:17.671 --> 52:21.468
You awake?
Mmm.

52:21.710 --> 52:24.612
Y. You know, I know you might be a little
bit afraid about having this procedure,

52:24.815 --> 52:28.207
but I hear the transplant is just
like having a tooth pulled or something.

52:28.386 --> 52:31.931
I'm not afraid.
I just haven't decided yet.

52:33.191 --> 52:34.784
You're gonna have that test.

52:34.925 --> 52:37.227
This is my sister
we're talking about.

52:37.394 --> 52:40.558
We're not gonna let her die just
so you can have one of your moods.

52:40.765 --> 52:42.904
Dad, okay.

52:45.004 --> 52:47.906
No, no, no, no, No, Dad.

52:52.145 --> 52:55.047
Correct me if I'm wrong.
But leukemia,

52:55.248 --> 52:57.649
that's one of the diseases they
pretty much have worked out, right?

52:57.786 --> 53:00.753
Like diabetes.
I will correct you. That is wrong.

53:00.956 --> 53:03.225
What is gonna happen
to my sister now?

53:03.392 --> 53:06.239
On the off chance
you can't find a donor?

53:10.499 --> 53:11.873
Why don't you sit down?

53:15.871 --> 53:18.424
You see, without
a bone marrow transplant,

53:18.607 --> 53:21.509
we have to rely on chemical therapies,
what you would call chemotherapy,

53:21.712 --> 53:25.421
as a way of sustaining the patient
over a number of years.

53:26.984 --> 53:30.440
What kind of a number?
Ten?

53:30.624 --> 53:32.924
Uh, a lower number.

53:33.119 --> 53:35.356
Nine?

53:35.555 --> 53:38.108
A much lower number.

53:39.328 --> 53:43.801
As the immune system suffers under
the chemotherapy, she'll grow weaker.

53:44.032 --> 53:47.742
And, and, there could be
respiratory problems.

53:47.971 --> 53:51.354
Sometimes patients become bedridden,
totally dependent.

53:51.574 --> 53:54.127
Hopelessly depressed.

53:55.078 --> 53:58.045
Eventually you'll just have to find a
full-time nurse to help you take care of...

53:58.249 --> 54:00.900
Help me? What?
You can't take it all on yourself.

54:01.118 --> 54:04.249
Your sister, your father,
and then there's your aunt.

54:05.657 --> 54:08.024
I'm not taking anything...

54:08.158 --> 54:10.711
Why would you think that?
Well, I assumed...

54:10.929 --> 54:15.239
No, no, no. I live in Ohio.
I just got a degree in cosmetology.

54:15.534 --> 54:17.476
She's gonna be fine!

54:20.806 --> 54:22.661
Okay...
Okay...

54:22.808 --> 54:25.230
Yes.
Yes.

54:28.115 --> 54:31.123
How could one sister be so good...

54:31.286 --> 54:35.246
and the other so bad?

54:35.556 --> 54:41.023
So you're saying that Coral
is good and Amber's bad?

54:41.365 --> 54:44.082
Coral used to be bad.

54:44.268 --> 54:48.545
But she's been a saint
ever since her car accident.

54:48.806 --> 54:52.035
That Volvo was a blessing.

54:53.477 --> 54:56.445
Come on, come on.
See? Whoop!

55:09.395 --> 55:12.264
I but they have
really good care here, you know?

55:12.498 --> 55:14.440
Dad never put Mom in a place
like this.

55:15.068 --> 55:17.370
Do you remember how
he cared for her?

55:17.602 --> 55:21.181
I was little.
I wasn't allowed in the room.

55:25.646 --> 55:27.653
Excuse me.
I get my degree next quarter.

55:27.783 --> 55:29.987
Well, you should be proud of that.
Oh, yeah.

55:30.185 --> 55:32.073
I already did one
freelance job.

55:32.220 --> 55:35.798
I did hair for a TV commercial. It's just
local, but guess how much they paid me?

55:36.024 --> 55:38.741
I don't feel like guessing.
Guess!

55:38.928 --> 55:41.863
Guess! Three hundred dollars?

55:45.803 --> 55:48.039
That's right.
Why'd you guess that?

55:48.206 --> 55:49.613
It just popped into my head.

55:49.774 --> 55:52.262
Most people would've
guessed lower.

55:52.440 --> 55:54.512
Three hundred dollars
is a lot of money.

55:54.677 --> 55:57.939
I feel like my life
is finally starting.

55:59.048 --> 56:01.187
Ladies?

56:03.687 --> 56:08.194
What a beautiful... room.
Wouldn't Ruth love this, Bessie?

56:08.459 --> 56:11.492
This place gives me the creeps.
Marry me, Coral.

56:11.694 --> 56:14.312
Yes, Lance, yes. I want to be your wife.

56:14.965 --> 56:17.038
Oh, Coral, do you mean it?
I'll drop the charges.

56:17.234 --> 56:20.104
What are Coral
and Lance up to today?

56:20.304 --> 56:24.297
I'm going to show you something over
here that we're particularly proud of.

56:24.543 --> 56:28.253
Uh, this is our state-of-the-art
physical therapy room.

56:28.480 --> 56:29.909
Right over here.

56:30.616 --> 56:32.372
Oh!

56:32.519 --> 56:35.389
I wouldn't mind living here.
This is great.

56:36.823 --> 56:38.645
Yeah, isn't that?
Hello, Doctor.

56:42.798 --> 56:46.061
Also we have a full range
of activities for our residents.

56:46.235 --> 56:51.220
Uh, computer games,
a video library, sing-alongs,

56:51.539 --> 56:54.671
nerf basketball, date nights.
Who's Dad gonna date?

56:54.876 --> 56:58.771
You'd be surprised, Miss Wakefield.
Women outnumber men here five to one.

56:59.016 --> 57:01.864
I don't think we can afford
such a nice place though.

57:02.052 --> 57:05.849
Well, if you dropped into a lower income
bracket you could qualify for financial aid.

57:06.123 --> 57:09.701
Lower? Seventy percent of our residents
have qualified for assistance...

57:09.929 --> 57:12.132
by spending their savings
and their home equity.

57:12.297 --> 57:15.364
On something that has no resale value
and cannot be considered an asset.

57:15.600 --> 57:17.673
Lower?
What do they buy?

57:17.838 --> 57:20.293
Most buy very elaborate
tombstones.

57:21.774 --> 57:23.400
I'm gonna wait in the car.

57:25.846 --> 57:29.075
Do you have something
that I can take with me?

57:29.282 --> 57:30.711
Of course.

57:45.033 --> 57:47.400
Bet the boys are hungry.
Want me to make lunch?

57:47.569 --> 57:49.709
Why can't you take Dad and Ruth?
I don't think so.

57:49.834 --> 57:51.940
You could move down here.
You could have the house!

57:52.107 --> 57:55.206
No. I got Hank to think about.
He's very unhappy there.

57:55.444 --> 57:58.128
Of course he's unhappy.
If he were happy, he wouldn't be there.

57:58.314 --> 58:01.576
You could have him transferred. You
could find a very nice place for him here.

58:01.784 --> 58:04.337
You could have the whole house!
You could have the sunshine.

58:04.522 --> 58:06.823
You could find work down here, Lee.
No.

58:06.992 --> 58:09.381
Why not?
Just... no.

58:09.560 --> 58:11.666
Give me one good reason. 'Cause I don't
want to! I made this decision once already.

58:11.998 --> 58:16.886
Hen Daddy had his first stroke, I made this decision the
I was not gonna waste my life.

58:17.170 --> 58:20.519
You think I've wasted my life?
God, of course not.

58:20.740 --> 58:23.325
I can't imagine a better way
to have spent my life.

58:23.510 --> 58:25.681
Then we both made the right decision.
What decision?

58:25.879 --> 58:28.695
Dad got sick and I came down to help out
for a little while. You didn't.

58:28.850 --> 58:31.312
I had plans, I had a husband.
I couldn't come down.

58:31.454 --> 58:32.981
You didn't come down!

58:33.154 --> 58:35.543
What makes you think for a second
I didn't have plans?

58:35.722 --> 58:37.697
You know, you're just the most...

58:37.859 --> 58:39.746
Come on, say it.
Say it, say it!

58:39.894 --> 58:41.836
You've been saying it a million
different ways since I came down here.

58:41.996 --> 58:44.963
Leave her alone!
What are you yelling at her for?

58:45.234 --> 58:47.241
She wants to tell you
what a terrible person I am.

58:47.402 --> 58:49.791
I have bent over backwards to be nice to
you from the moment you walked in that door.

58:49.972 --> 58:52.175
That's right. You are nice to me
when you want something.

58:52.340 --> 58:54.762
What are you talking about? Come on, Hank.
You think Aunt Bessie's being nice to you...

58:54.944 --> 58:57.944
all of a sudden because she...
what, felt an urge?

58:58.148 --> 58:59.745
What? Shut up.
Come on, come on.

58:59.849 --> 59:02.020
Listen, did you ever get a birthday
present from your Aunt Bessie?

59:02.185 --> 59:05.000
I thought about my nephews.
I thought about you all the time.

59:05.188 --> 59:06.879
It's just...
How 'bout a card?

59:07.058 --> 59:10.091
Did you ever get a card from your Aunt
Bessie? We were not close. We were...

59:10.294 --> 59:11.985
You didn't speak to me
for 20 years!

59:12.129 --> 59:15.609
You're supposed to take care of your
family. I took care of my family!

59:15.866 --> 59:18.866
I raised two kids all by myself.
Never even heard from you people.

59:19.073 --> 59:22.269
I am finally getting my life together.
Nobody's gonna take it away from me.

59:23.711 --> 59:25.686
I can't wait to get out of here!

59:35.890 --> 59:37.679
Thanks a lot
for helping me out, Charlie.

59:37.826 --> 59:40.575
It's a lot to ask of someone
to donate their bone marrow.

59:40.762 --> 59:43.063
I think it sounds neat.

59:43.230 --> 59:45.751
Could I have your
medical history card, please?

59:45.967 --> 59:48.488
Bob. Bob!

59:48.671 --> 59:50.842
Could I have your
medical history card, please?

59:53.442 --> 59:56.312
What grade are you in now, Hank?
Oh, I'm Charlie.

59:56.513 --> 59:58.422
I'm Dr. Wally.

01:00:02.287 --> 01:00:04.524
Um, you have
to fill out one too.

01:00:04.689 --> 01:00:07.406
Oh, no, he's not here to get the test.
Okay.

01:00:24.344 --> 01:00:26.515
Hank, am I reading
your medical card correctly?

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:29.710
Uh, are you currently on lithium?
Yeah.

01:00:29.914 --> 01:00:31.801
It's a great drug,
isn't it?

01:00:32.784 --> 01:00:35.402
Uh...
Can I ask you something?

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.887
Did you find you put on
a lot of weight since?

01:00:38.056 --> 01:00:39.878
No.

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:42.253
No.

01:00:43.962 --> 01:00:45.937
Hmm.

01:00:51.105 --> 01:00:53.822
Nervous?
No.

01:00:57.012 --> 01:00:59.183
Uh, thank you.
Thank you.

01:01:00.148 --> 01:01:03.246
You know, these offices
used to be infested with bugs.

01:01:04.885 --> 01:01:07.057
Well, bugs don't bother me.

01:01:07.223 --> 01:01:09.078
No?
Well, you know.

01:01:09.192 --> 01:01:11.614
They crawl out of the drain
in the boys shower.

01:01:11.795 --> 01:01:16.049
Sometimes they, like, hide
in the junk pile in the auto shop.

01:01:16.266 --> 01:01:17.793
They, like, float around in the soap
basin in the sink. You get used to 'em.

01:01:17.901 --> 01:01:20.268
I wouldn't.
There's this one dude in my room...

01:01:20.403 --> 01:01:22.825
There's 12 of us in this one room,
right? This one dude,

01:01:23.005 --> 01:01:25.111
he catches bugs and he puts them
on, like, this little leash.

01:01:25.274 --> 01:01:26.998
A leash?
Yeah, it's a hair leash.

01:01:27.144 --> 01:01:29.315
He takes out a strand of his hair,
he ties it around the bug.

01:01:29.479 --> 01:01:32.196
The other end he tacks down
under his bunk. One time...

01:01:32.416 --> 01:01:35.994
he had this whole zoo of bugs walkin'
around in circles all over the place. Hank.

01:01:36.222 --> 01:01:39.768
My friend, he grabbed the back of his
cafeteria tray, and he smashed them all!

01:01:41.994 --> 01:01:44.132
That was funny.

01:01:44.231 --> 01:01:48.323
Why are you making up these stories?
What do you mean?

01:01:48.602 --> 01:01:52.017
These stories:
Razors under the tongue, hair leashes.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.437
I'm not makin' anything up. Why did
you pretend you weren't going to tested?

01:01:55.644 --> 01:01:58.361
Oh, you, you think
I'm lyin' about that too?

01:01:58.547 --> 01:02:00.783
Okay, fine, you win!
I'm lying!

01:02:10.594 --> 01:02:13.376
Hank, I...
I haven't told you shit, all right?

01:02:13.531 --> 01:02:15.768
You don't know anything about shere they've
got me now. Then, tell me if you want.

01:02:15.966 --> 01:02:18.137
No, you don't know. Okay?
Tell me, Hank.

01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:20.636
You don't know!
Tell me!

01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:24.832
I was in the hospital
I hated it. I was scared.

01:02:29.081 --> 01:02:31.023
You know, there's this one dude...

01:02:31.183 --> 01:02:33.867
If this is another tall tale,
I'm not interested in this.

01:02:37.323 --> 01:02:40.105
I'm going inside.
I'm gonna see if Charlie's done.

01:03:03.682 --> 01:03:06.748
I played in a pool tournament
in my ward.

01:03:06.953 --> 01:03:08.579
Mom tell you that?
No.

01:03:10.857 --> 01:03:13.824
I came in fourth.

01:03:14.026 --> 01:03:16.098
It's true.

01:03:16.263 --> 01:03:18.598
She doesn't think it's
such a big deal, though.

01:03:18.765 --> 01:03:20.870
Well, that's... great.

01:03:22.669 --> 01:03:25.451
Got my toe broken in there.
How?

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.357
This guy threw this garbage can.
It landed right on my foot.

01:03:28.543 --> 01:03:30.169
Why'd he do that?

01:03:30.846 --> 01:03:33.115
No reason I know of.

01:03:36.719 --> 01:03:39.567
There's a lot of drugs
that float around in there.

01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:41.545
Do you take them?

01:03:43.327 --> 01:03:46.196
Most of the time I just keep to myself.
Mm-hmm.

01:03:47.965 --> 01:03:51.991
I think, like, what it would
be like to be... someone else.

01:03:54.008 --> 01:03:57.357
Like, I could have this house
with all this land around it.

01:03:57.577 --> 01:04:01.669
Have a bunch of dogs runnin' around wild
and build, like, a go-cart track.

01:04:01.916 --> 01:04:05.625
Man, those places make so much money.
We'd be rakin' that stuff in.

01:04:09.189 --> 01:04:12.156
And nobody would know where I was.
Yeah.

01:04:12.359 --> 01:04:14.268
Just be gone.

01:04:16.997 --> 01:04:20.707
Most of the time I just think about...
bein' someplace else.

01:04:20.936 --> 01:04:23.554
Then why aren't you?
Hmm?

01:04:23.738 --> 01:04:26.193
Why aren't you someplace else?
What do you mean?

01:04:26.409 --> 01:04:28.798
You're the one that told me
people only do what they want.

01:04:28.978 --> 01:04:30.505
Yeah?
So?

01:04:30.646 --> 01:04:33.557
You must want to be there.
No, no way!

01:04:33.716 --> 01:04:36.628
Then show them you don't need to be
there, Hank. It's not easy like that.

01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:39.667
I don't want you wasting your life
in there, Hank. Well, neither do I.

01:04:39.857 --> 01:04:41.897
Then why are you still there?
Because they put me there!

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:44.332
Why did they put you there?
'Cause I burned down the house.

01:04:44.464 --> 01:04:47.747
Why did you
burn down the house?

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:50.422
Hank, you wanna come inside?

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:52.331
We can get you started...

01:04:52.438 --> 01:04:55.340
while we're getting some orange juice
for little Charlie.

01:05:01.878 --> 01:05:04.245
Would you come back there
with me?

01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:07.938
Sure, I would.

01:05:33.482 --> 01:05:35.554
If-forgot my coffee.

01:05:35.684 --> 01:05:38.367
Why are you drinking coffee
so late?

01:05:38.552 --> 01:05:40.113
I don't know. I... like it.

01:05:43.926 --> 01:05:47.504
You have a way with Hank.
Oh! I don't.

01:05:47.729 --> 01:05:49.769
Yeah, you do.

01:05:51.267 --> 01:05:52.828
He's a good boy.

01:05:55.805 --> 01:05:58.008
Is he?
Sure, he is.

01:05:58.174 --> 01:05:59.962
I wish I knew your secret.

01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:03.622
I don't know.
I just talk to him.

01:06:03.846 --> 01:06:05.734
You saying I don't?

01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:12.532
I'm tired, and we've got
Disney World tomorrow.

01:06:25.739 --> 01:06:27.877
I can fix that wig
for you, you know.

01:06:28.042 --> 01:06:30.693
Does it look bad?
No.

01:06:30.878 --> 01:06:34.807
But if you have a wig, you should
try, uh, to have fun with it.

01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:38.017
You should try different looks.
Uh... huh.

01:06:39.454 --> 01:06:41.396
You know,
maybe something sporty.

01:06:41.557 --> 01:06:43.891
Maybe out-on-the-town,
evening kind of... thing.

01:06:44.059 --> 01:06:45.945
Well, I just brush it now and then.
Uh... huh.

01:06:46.062 --> 01:06:50.088
I also have my whole makeup kit
down here. You wanna see?

01:06:50.833 --> 01:06:54.346
Now this is a really great
night cream, Bessie. This is...

01:06:54.504 --> 01:06:57.286
Oh. Well, I don't know. I never
bother much with... makeup.

01:06:57.574 --> 01:06:59.232
Hmm. You should.

01:07:00.077 --> 01:07:02.695
Because it's fun.

01:07:02.879 --> 01:07:05.945
And you never know
when you might meet somebody.

01:07:06.151 --> 01:07:08.834
Oh, my goodness.
I haven't thought about a man in years!

01:07:09.054 --> 01:07:11.989
Oh... you're lying!

01:07:15.461 --> 01:07:16.987
Lee?

01:07:18.664 --> 01:07:20.871
I'm sorry if we haven't
been seeing eye to eye.

01:07:21.001 --> 01:07:23.270
I don't want us to fight.
I don't think we have been.

01:07:24.873 --> 01:07:26.848
I want us to get along.
We do get along.

01:07:27.008 --> 01:07:30.456
No, but I mean I don't...
I don't want us to just get along.

01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:33.549
I don't want us to be polite.
Well, okay.

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.604
I don't have
any problem with that.

01:07:35.752 --> 01:07:38.207
I... I want...

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:40.701
I...

01:07:44.128 --> 01:07:46.583
Nothing much seems important
to me right now.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.783
I...
We're sisters.

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.706
Oh.
Shouldn't we...

01:07:58.943 --> 01:08:03.133
No, he just startles himself sometimes,
and then he goes right back to sleep.

01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:07.211
Mmm.

01:08:12.725 --> 01:08:15.627
Are you seeing anybody now?
Usually.

01:08:15.862 --> 01:08:18.229
I hope you have
someone real in your life.

01:08:18.398 --> 01:08:21.911
I don't have any trouble with that.
Well, I...

01:08:22.136 --> 01:08:24.046
I'm not talking about that.
Well, you should be.

01:08:24.238 --> 01:08:26.823
Hey, there's no reason why
you haven't had love in your life.

01:08:27.009 --> 01:08:30.587
I had a true love.
You did?

01:08:30.813 --> 01:08:33.082
Yes.
Did he know?

01:08:33.249 --> 01:08:34.459
Yes.

01:08:35.618 --> 01:08:37.375
How could I not have known this?

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.692
Oh, he wasn't somebody
that you would know.

01:08:40.523 --> 01:08:44.778
Come on. It's not like
I'm gonna tell anybody.

01:08:45.895 --> 01:08:48.035
Clarence James.

01:08:50.332 --> 01:08:53.649
Who? Well, he was only
around during the summers.

01:08:54.738 --> 01:08:56.299
Oh, my... God!

01:08:56.474 --> 01:08:58.613
You went with a carny worker.
Well, he was a very nice person.

01:08:58.776 --> 01:09:00.816
I, I didn't say anything.

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:04.307
This is why I kept it a secret.
Wow! Which one was he?

01:09:06.618 --> 01:09:08.823
He mostly ran
the Ferris wheel.

01:09:12.492 --> 01:09:15.459
Oh, yeah, I remember him.
He was cute.

01:09:17.296 --> 01:09:18.638
Oh, yes.
And he had the funniest laugh.

01:09:18.764 --> 01:09:22.725
He'd open his mouth real wide
and... no sound would come out.

01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:25.042
Oh, God!

01:09:30.545 --> 01:09:33.960
No sound would come out.

01:09:35.714 --> 01:09:38.103
Wow.

01:09:38.285 --> 01:09:41.481
So, uh, what happened?

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.885
Well, you know how they
used to have that last picnic...

01:09:45.125 --> 01:09:46.948
down by the river?
Yeah.

01:09:47.094 --> 01:09:49.166
Well, Clarence goes swimming...
Yeah.

01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:52.330
And he knows everybody's
watching him and everybody's there.

01:09:52.533 --> 01:09:56.276
His family, his friends and...

01:09:56.504 --> 01:09:58.512
You.
And me.

01:09:58.675 --> 01:10:02.352
And... An... And he's,
uh, laughing.

01:10:02.578 --> 01:10:05.447
You know, he's making
that monkey face, that...

01:10:09.586 --> 01:10:12.520
And this gets all of us laughing.
Then he dunks under the water...

01:10:12.756 --> 01:10:14.763
Yeah.
And he pops up again, and he's...

01:10:14.925 --> 01:10:18.373
He's laughing even harder. Then he dives
under again, and he doesn't come up.

01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:21.086
And he doesn't come up.
Yeah.

01:10:21.266 --> 01:10:23.470
And he doesn't come up.

01:10:27.774 --> 01:10:29.530
What?

01:10:29.675 --> 01:10:32.228
Yeah.

01:10:32.411 --> 01:10:35.258
Laughing and choking
looked the same on Clarence.

01:10:37.216 --> 01:10:39.355
He drowned. And...

01:10:41.053 --> 01:10:43.671
We...

01:10:43.858 --> 01:10:47.633
Oh, God, we were just...
standing there watching him.

01:10:49.063 --> 01:10:52.675
Oh, my... God!

01:10:54.537 --> 01:10:56.609
I can't believe
you never told me this.

01:10:56.772 --> 01:11:00.701
If I couldn't tell people I had a
carny boyfriend I couldn't tell them...

01:11:00.944 --> 01:11:03.726
my carny boyfriend drowned.
Yeah, but you should've told me.

01:11:03.914 --> 01:11:06.980
We were never that close.

01:11:08.687 --> 01:11:10.377
We weren't?

01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:13.817
No.

01:11:24.636 --> 01:11:26.709
Want me to do somethin'
with that wig?

01:11:26.838 --> 01:11:30.483
What?
I don't know. Let me see it.

01:11:30.711 --> 01:11:34.060
Well, here.
No. Y... You gotta take it off.

01:11:36.016 --> 01:11:37.325
Oh?

01:11:37.484 --> 01:11:39.491
I'm not gonna hurt it.

01:11:39.687 --> 01:11:42.556
Oh.
Here.

01:11:42.791 --> 01:11:45.060
Lee...
It's a good wig, Bessie.

01:11:45.293 --> 01:11:48.709
It's nicely wentilated. We can do
something with this. You want me to?

01:11:50.567 --> 01:11:51.973
Uh, sure.

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.929
Yeah, it's a good weave.

01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:07.973
I'm glad that we made this trip.
I wish we could stay longer.

01:12:08.152 --> 01:12:10.159
Here.
I'll go get my brush.

01:12:29.774 --> 01:12:30.951
I found it.

01:13:30.642 --> 01:13:31.624
Okay.

01:13:38.083 --> 01:13:40.669
Whoa!
Well, hello!

01:13:40.854 --> 01:13:42.447
Bessie!

01:13:42.589 --> 01:13:45.622
Wait a minute. Do you like it?
Oui.

01:13:45.825 --> 01:13:48.640
Gettin' real hot in this room, huh?

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.556
Huh?

01:14:05.249 --> 01:14:08.282
Is that too much wind
for you, Hank?

01:14:08.419 --> 01:14:11.234
What?
Is that too much wind?

01:14:11.419 --> 01:14:13.274
No, it's okay.

01:14:13.421 --> 01:14:16.716
Stick your hand
out the window, Charlie.

01:14:16.925 --> 01:14:19.445
It's like an airplane.

01:14:20.829 --> 01:14:22.520
Whee!

01:14:36.113 --> 01:14:38.349
Here we go!
Whee!

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.688
Whee... ee!
Excuse me.

01:14:56.868 --> 01:14:59.257
Here we go!

01:14:59.439 --> 01:15:02.308
Faster!
Ooh, Charlie, faster!

01:15:02.509 --> 01:15:04.232
Faster! Ooh!

01:15:04.409 --> 01:15:06.548
Beep, beep! Comin' through!

01:15:07.513 --> 01:15:09.935
Hold on, Aunt Ruth.

01:15:10.116 --> 01:15:12.986
Faster! Faster!
Faster!

01:15:13.186 --> 01:15:15.903
Hey, Charlie, slow down.
Slow down.

01:15:16.089 --> 01:15:19.798
Okay, we'll meet you
by Pirates of the Caribbean in an hour.

01:15:20.029 --> 01:15:21.852
An hour?
Yeah. Right where the line starts.

01:15:21.997 --> 01:15:24.233
All right. Bye.
Bye.

01:15:39.584 --> 01:15:41.045
Oh, God!

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.309
This Swiss Family thing
tree house is huge.

01:16:00.205 --> 01:16:03.140
I'm really proud of you, Hank.

01:16:03.343 --> 01:16:05.830
For gettin' tested
for Bessie.

01:16:11.819 --> 01:16:13.193
You're disgusting.

01:16:17.992 --> 01:16:20.545
Charlie, do you want me
to push Aunt Ruth for a while?

01:16:20.729 --> 01:16:21.939
I like pushing.

01:16:22.098 --> 01:16:24.367
Okay.
He's a good driver.

01:16:24.568 --> 01:16:27.731
Well, I'll catch up with you.
I'm just gonna sit in the sun, okay?

01:16:27.937 --> 01:16:29.792
All right. Bye, bye.
Bye, bye.

01:16:29.939 --> 01:16:31.947
Hold on. Here we go.

01:16:38.116 --> 01:16:41.083
So why don't you pick out
something nice for your Aunt Bessie?

01:16:41.286 --> 01:16:43.653
How about my bone marrow?
You think she'd like that?

01:16:44.656 --> 01:16:47.183
Hey, look!

01:16:47.326 --> 01:16:49.691
Love Bug. Remember?

01:16:49.829 --> 01:16:51.968
We saw that on TV.
We watched it together.

01:16:52.132 --> 01:16:56.125
No. I remember Dad took me
to see Indiana Jones, though.

01:16:56.935 --> 01:16:59.553
You know, I think you're
doin' really well on this trip.

01:16:59.672 --> 01:17:01.079
Sort of. Stop it.

01:17:02.343 --> 01:17:06.020
Tomorrow, when we go back, everybody's
gonna hear about how well you did.

01:17:06.246 --> 01:17:07.653
I said, stop it.

01:17:07.814 --> 01:17:10.564
I'm not going back.
I'm staying with Aunt Bessie.

01:17:18.826 --> 01:17:20.714
Peter pan. Careful.

01:17:20.862 --> 01:17:23.646
That was a cute movie.
Yeah, I remember I saw it with Dad.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.871
Yeah. No, you didn't.
Yeah, we went to a drive-in.

01:17:26.035 --> 01:17:28.140
No.
I saw it in his old Thunderbird.

01:17:28.304 --> 01:17:30.192
No, no, no, no!

01:17:30.339 --> 01:17:33.655
Not with your dad. You wanna know somethin'
about your dad? I'll tell you somethin'.

01:17:33.876 --> 01:17:37.193
On Saturdays I...
I worked.

01:17:37.415 --> 01:17:41.409
Your dad took care of you. And sometimes
on Saturdays you would get hurt.

01:17:41.654 --> 01:17:43.890
He said that you roughhoused
too much.

01:17:44.055 --> 01:17:45.550
Yeah, so?
So...

01:17:45.725 --> 01:17:49.271
I would yell at you and tell you
to stop roughhousing so much.

01:17:49.528 --> 01:17:53.205
But you would still get hurt...
every time I left you with him.

01:17:53.432 --> 01:17:57.393
So I would yell at you and yell at you, and
I would beg you to stop making him hurt you...

01:17:57.637 --> 01:18:00.637
because... he was my husband
and I loved him.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.695
And what was I supposed to do?

01:18:03.677 --> 01:18:05.204
Then Charlie was born.

01:18:07.248 --> 01:18:08.774
So I packed you kids up and I...

01:18:08.915 --> 01:18:10.955
Dad never hit me.

01:18:11.117 --> 01:18:13.768
Oh, yeah, he did.
No, I would remember that.

01:18:13.956 --> 01:18:15.679
You were four years old.

01:18:15.823 --> 01:18:18.027
You're the one that fought
with him and not me, okay?

01:18:18.192 --> 01:18:20.297
Yeah, but he hit you.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:30.503
My feelings for you, Hank,
are like a big bowl of...

01:18:30.775 --> 01:18:34.189
fish hooks.

01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:36.799
I can't just pick one up
at a time.

01:18:37.014 --> 01:18:40.810
I pick one up and they all come,
so I just had to leave'em alone.

01:18:44.051 --> 01:18:45.807
You're a liar.

01:19:00.971 --> 01:19:02.149
Ohh,

01:20:01.572 --> 01:20:03.743
Oh, my God!

01:20:03.909 --> 01:20:06.113
Don't touch her.

01:20:06.912 --> 01:20:09.400
Somebody should get some help.

01:20:14.121 --> 01:20:16.161
What happened?
I fainted.

01:20:16.323 --> 01:20:18.657
Yeah.
There was blood in my mouth.

01:20:18.825 --> 01:20:21.062
Is your mouth still bleeding?
Uh... uh.

01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:24.262
No. Did a doctor look at me?

01:20:24.466 --> 01:20:28.460
No. He... He just thought you fainted,
so he carried you in here...

01:20:28.703 --> 01:20:30.677
Who's he?
To lie down.

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.728
Uh, Goofy.

01:20:32.875 --> 01:20:35.013
Goofy?
Yeah.

01:20:35.177 --> 01:20:38.144
Goofy carried me to Mickey's house?
Yeah.

01:20:38.381 --> 01:20:40.618
Yeah.

01:20:43.086 --> 01:20:45.191
He just probably...
he didn't know you were bleeding,

01:20:45.388 --> 01:20:49.480
so maybe you... felt faint
because you baven't been eating.

01:20:49.727 --> 01:20:53.753
Maybe that's all it is
I fainted 'cause I was scared.

01:20:53.998 --> 01:20:57.356
I can't sleep anymore, Lee.
I never sleep.

01:20:57.536 --> 01:21:00.219
I'm afraid to close my eyes because...
Oh, Bess.

01:21:00.405 --> 01:21:02.893
Oh, if I close my eyes,
Don't, don't.

01:21:03.071 --> 01:21:05.210
I'm not gonna wake up.
No, no, no, no.

01:21:05.373 --> 01:21:07.861
And so I just jerk myself awake.

01:21:08.044 --> 01:21:11.427
I yank myself awake
all night long, and then...

01:21:11.647 --> 01:21:13.021
Yeah.

01:21:13.216 --> 01:21:15.038
And then I pour myself
a cup of coffee, but...

01:21:16.286 --> 01:21:19.831
I. I'm trying to be brave, but I'm so...
Oh, darlin', I know, I know.

01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:22.359
I'm scared.
I know. It's all right.

01:21:22.526 --> 01:21:25.625
But you're gonna be okay, you know?
You're gonna be okay. You are.

01:21:25.831 --> 01:21:28.482
What do you have to be scared about?
Come on. You have...

01:21:28.667 --> 01:21:32.147
There's still Hank and Charlie to think
about. You're forgetting about them. Huh?

01:21:32.403 --> 01:21:35.665
You're gonna be... You're gonna be okay.
Yeah, you are.

01:21:35.874 --> 01:21:39.703
Where are they?
They're sittin' outside.

01:21:41.213 --> 01:21:43.995
You're so lucky
to have those boys.

01:21:46.253 --> 01:21:48.708
I know I am.
They're good boys,

01:21:48.889 --> 01:21:51.093
both of 'em.

01:21:51.258 --> 01:21:53.679
We're fooling ourselves, Lee.

01:21:53.895 --> 01:21:56.131
Hank and Charlie
aren't gonna match.

01:21:56.297 --> 01:22:00.226
I won't pretend any longer. I have too
many decisions to make before you leave.

01:22:00.469 --> 01:22:04.560
No, we don't have to make any now. We're
gonna hear about the boy's tests tomorrow.

01:22:23.595 --> 01:22:24.544
Hank?

01:22:59.668 --> 01:23:02.767
I haven't had reason
to pretty myself up...

01:23:02.972 --> 01:23:06.682
since, oh, I can't think when.

01:23:06.944 --> 01:23:08.024
Well,

01:23:08.145 --> 01:23:09.967
today is the day.

01:23:10.147 --> 01:23:12.995
They almost got married
once before.

01:23:13.184 --> 01:23:16.533
But Amber
set the church on fire.

01:23:16.756 --> 01:23:20.912
Ha. So, is Coral
the same character...

01:23:21.156 --> 01:23:23.971
who shot Lance's dad in the head?
Uh... huh.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.494
And now they're getting married?

01:23:26.664 --> 01:23:30.919
Well, he lived.
And she felt awful about it.

01:23:31.167 --> 01:23:32.923
Huh.

01:23:40.243 --> 01:23:42.415
Oh!

01:23:42.581 --> 01:23:45.002
Oh, Charlie.

01:23:45.183 --> 01:23:48.118
What a good job!

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.741
Ruth, you look beautiful!

01:23:51.692 --> 01:23:55.554
Oh. Don't make fun of me.
I'm not.

01:23:55.828 --> 01:23:59.985
I'm just a silly old woman getting
all dressed up for a TV show.

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:01.696
No, you're not.

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:04.936
Charlie, where's your brother?
I don't know.

01:24:06.607 --> 01:24:08.429
Hank?

01:24:41.046 --> 01:24:43.020
Hey!
Hey.

01:24:43.181 --> 01:24:46.148
What are you doin' up?
Oh, I'm gonna get Dad's 1:00.

01:24:46.352 --> 01:24:49.581
Oh, I was gonna do that.
I can do it.

01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:52.473
You're supposed to be resting.
I am.

01:24:52.659 --> 01:24:56.074
You want some snacks?
I'm making some nachos here.

01:24:56.331 --> 01:24:58.087
Better just cut me up
some fruit.

01:25:04.738 --> 01:25:06.648
Hello?

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:09.077
Oh, yeah. She's here.

01:25:09.243 --> 01:25:12.090
What is it? It's Dr. Wally.
He wants to talk to you.

01:25:12.278 --> 01:25:14.351
Ohh.

01:25:14.582 --> 01:25:17.103
Uh, hello.

01:25:17.284 --> 01:25:20.514
Oh, you did? Good!

01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:24.713
Um...

01:25:27.063 --> 01:25:29.932
Well, what is...

01:25:31.334 --> 01:25:33.341
I see.

01:25:33.503 --> 01:25:37.432
Then, I should keep taking
what I'm taking now.

01:25:41.214 --> 01:25:43.581
No. No, no.

01:25:43.717 --> 01:25:45.627
No. I understand.

01:25:45.819 --> 01:25:48.502
N... I'm not. Okay.

01:25:50.825 --> 01:25:54.174
Thank you.
Good-bye, Doctor.

01:25:56.163 --> 01:25:58.434
Well, um...

01:25:58.566 --> 01:26:02.843
They got the boys' test results back,
and it looks like it didn't work out.

01:26:04.638 --> 01:26:07.540
Oh. Well, I mean, it's, it's
pretty much what we expected.

01:26:07.742 --> 01:26:09.979
We knew that the...
What?

01:26:13.850 --> 01:26:16.152
Maybe they should do the test again.
Maybe they made a mistake.

01:26:16.351 --> 01:26:18.173
Maybe. Now...

01:26:19.689 --> 01:26:22.656
I'm gonna continue taking
the therapies I'm taking now.

01:26:22.826 --> 01:26:25.673
That's good. That's real...
That's good, because...

01:26:25.862 --> 01:26:29.474
those are good things to be doing.
Okay.

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:33.726
Um, we should tell
the boys.

01:26:35.139 --> 01:26:38.041
Well, I was in the middle
of doing something. I...

01:26:39.878 --> 01:26:41.634
What was I do...
Lee? Oh, Dad!

01:26:45.286 --> 01:26:47.707
Oh.

01:26:47.889 --> 01:26:50.278
You wanna go lie down now?

01:26:50.458 --> 01:26:52.665
No, no, no, no.
I'm...

01:26:52.794 --> 01:26:55.412
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I just, uh...

01:26:55.598 --> 01:26:57.605
Here, I can do this.
I just, uh...

01:26:57.766 --> 01:27:00.351
No, no, no, Lee.
It's okay.

01:27:13.584 --> 01:27:15.307
Oh, Lee.

01:27:16.787 --> 01:27:18.543
I've been so lucky.

01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:21.052
Oh, Bessie.

01:27:21.225 --> 01:27:25.153
I've been so lucky
to have Dad and Ruth.

01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:27.797
I've had such love
in my life.

01:27:28.567 --> 01:27:30.672
You know, I look back...

01:27:30.837 --> 01:27:35.115
and I've had such...
such love.

01:27:36.442 --> 01:27:38.547
They love you very much.

01:27:38.711 --> 01:27:41.166
No, that's not what I mean.
No, no.

01:27:44.084 --> 01:27:47.084
I mean that I love them.

01:27:47.287 --> 01:27:51.477
I've been so lucky to have
been able to love someone so much.

01:27:53.692 --> 01:27:55.514
Yeah, you are.
Yeah.

01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:57.220
Lee,

01:27:59.966 --> 01:28:02.781
we should tell Hank, huh?

01:28:05.705 --> 01:28:08.324
About the tests.
Yeah.

01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:10.615
We will.

01:28:16.017 --> 01:28:18.700
I better...
I better...

01:29:33.037 --> 01:29:34.346
Where'er you going'?

01:29:40.814 --> 01:29:41.991
Uh, uh, I'm going'...

01:30:04.605 --> 01:30:06.394
Goin' into the kitchen.

01:30:06.541 --> 01:30:08.875
Nobody's had any lunch yet,
have they?

01:30:11.609 --> 01:30:13.617
Hey.
What?

01:30:16.683 --> 01:30:17.860
Oh, nothing.

01:30:17.983 --> 01:30:21.440
But just... If you decide to take
a ride or something, just...

01:30:21.622 --> 01:30:24.491
You oughta let me know.

01:30:30.531 --> 01:30:32.953
I worry about you.

01:30:38.806 --> 01:30:40.116
Okay.

01:30:42.777 --> 01:30:44.370
Okay.

01:31:06.071 --> 01:31:07.533
Dad? Look.

01:31:07.672 --> 01:31:09.079
Ooh.

01:31:16.682 --> 01:31:18.243
Hi.

01:32:52.821 --> 01:32:55.093
Ooh.
Around and around.

01:32:55.226 --> 01:32:56.599
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:33:03.934 --> 01:33:06.269
Yes.

01:33:29.828 --> 01:33:30.755
Ooh, Ooh.

01:34:06.537 --> 01:34:08.293
Dad.

01:34:08.438 --> 01:34:11.340
Oh, see?

01:34:12.209 --> 01:34:13.998
See?

01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:17.402
Just us.

01:34:18.515 --> 01:34:21.581
Look. Dad, look.
Lee's here too.

01:34:23.521 --> 01:34:25.496
You know Lee, don't you?

01:34:32.532 --> 01:34:34.954
Bessie! Oh, Bessie!

01:34:35.201 --> 01:34:39.641
You missed it!
Coral finally married Lance.

01:34:39.906 --> 01:34:42.077
But now,
wasn't Lance married to Coral's mother?

01:34:42.276 --> 01:34:45.342
No. Coral was married
to Lance's father.

01:34:45.546 --> 01:34:47.913
He's really a nice boy.
