- [flare strikes and burns]

00:13.781 --> 00:15.483
- Welcome to the Brain Frame.

00:15.483 --> 00:20.321
- [flare burning, music builds]

00:20.321 --> 00:29.863
[instrumental music]

01:20.848 --> 01:23.817
- HOBBS: The Brain Frame.

01:23.817 --> 01:26.854
- So it's a machine that
allows you to place yourself

01:26.854 --> 01:28.722
inside another person's mind.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.124
- Sure.

01:30.124 --> 01:32.693
In layman's terms, I guess
you could put it that way.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.363
- So you go inside
Hannah's head?

01:36.197 --> 01:37.631
How does that even look?

01:38.766 --> 01:40.401
- It looked...

01:41.502 --> 01:42.503
Weird.

01:42.503 --> 01:43.971
- It looked like
a shitty sewer.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.443
- Looks like a shitty sewer.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.611
- Is this Hannah's mind?

01:50.611 --> 01:51.345
- No.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.447
This is the Brain Frame.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.849
It's the physical manifestation
of the program I built.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.618
- Well, where's Hannah?

01:57.618 --> 02:00.654
- Hannah's mind is
behind these hatches.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.556
Where the Brain Frame is
filtering and partitioning her

02:02.556 --> 02:04.458
subconscious into dreams.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.893
- This place is a dump.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.195
- It's not a dump.

02:07.195 --> 02:08.862
It's utilitarian.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.232
- Well, I would have designed
it way better.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.766
- Guys.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.735
- Like I'm talkin' I would've
put some strippers over here.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.671
Maybe just a little cocaine
dispenser over here.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.607
And then that thing,
whatever that thing is doing,

02:19.607 --> 02:21.942
it would instead be dispensing
strawberry daiquiris

02:21.942 --> 02:22.943
because I love a good daiquiri.

02:22.943 --> 02:25.613
- Guys!

02:25.613 --> 02:26.747
- I can't breathe.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.216
- What do you mean
you can't breathe?

02:28.216 --> 02:29.483
- I made a mistake!

02:29.483 --> 02:30.484
We're gonna die in here!

02:30.484 --> 02:31.519
- No, no, no.

02:31.519 --> 02:32.620
Larry ran a statistical
analysis.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.787
Our chances of dying
are very low.

02:33.787 --> 02:34.688
- Low?

02:34.688 --> 02:35.589
How low?

02:35.589 --> 02:36.257
- Twelve percent.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.358
- Twelve per-?!

02:37.358 --> 02:38.859
Oh fuck!

02:38.859 --> 02:41.662
I just wanted to get her back
and now we're gonna die in here!

02:41.662 --> 02:42.863
The walls are closing in!

02:42.863 --> 02:43.864
Let me out!

02:43.864 --> 02:44.865
I gotta get out of here!

02:44.865 --> 02:46.066
- Hey!

02:46.066 --> 02:47.368
Hey, Sam, it's just
a panic attack, bud.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.135
Alright, before I dropped
out I was honors psych,

02:48.135 --> 02:50.304
I know what I'm doin'.

02:50.304 --> 02:50.938
Feels like you're
going crazy,

02:50.938 --> 02:51.672
losing your mind?

02:51.672 --> 02:52.273
Can't catch your breath?

02:52.273 --> 02:53.040
- Can't breathe.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.508
- Yeah, that's normal.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.543
I read that Scarlett Johansson
gets panic attacks all the

02:56.744 --> 02:57.811
time and what does she
have to panic about?

02:57.811 --> 02:59.313
Nothing.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.881
- She's got like the fourth
hottest tatties in the world.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.450
- Great tatties.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.385
- Breathe in for five for me,
hold for two, and out for five.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.386
Five, two, five.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.887
- [panicked exhaling]

03:06.887 --> 03:08.756
- You're not gonna die
in here, okay?

03:08.756 --> 03:10.624
'Cause I got your back.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.426
- Berkman's got your back.

03:12.426 --> 03:13.627
- * Berkman's got your back. *

03:13.627 --> 03:14.628
- Mhm.

03:14.628 --> 03:15.229
- * Berkman's got your back. *

03:15.229 --> 03:16.530
Sing it with me.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.197
- (together)
* Berkman's got your back. *

03:17.197 --> 03:19.533
- That's right.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.734
- (together) *
Berkman's got your back. *

03:20.734 --> 03:22.035
- I'm gonna hit the harmony,
you do the part.

03:22.035 --> 03:22.703
- (together)
* Berkman's got your back. *

03:22.703 --> 03:24.738
- That's great.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.576
- Knew you were good
for something.

03:28.576 --> 03:29.743
Larry how's that
hospital room?

03:30.911 --> 03:33.281
- It's coming your way in
hatch nÃºmero three.

03:33.281 --> 03:35.316
- Uh. Hospital?

03:35.316 --> 03:36.884
I thought we could create
a scene where I'm

03:36.884 --> 03:38.786
riding a horse, shirtless, uh...

03:38.786 --> 03:40.153
with a six-pack.

03:40.153 --> 03:42.055
I'm holding flowers and
these gluten-free cupcakes

03:42.055 --> 03:43.190
that she likes.

03:43.190 --> 03:43.891
- No, we're only using
elements that are

03:43.891 --> 03:45.826
fresh in her mind.

03:45.826 --> 03:46.894
Nothing fake or foreign.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.028
Foreign is bad.

03:48.028 --> 03:50.364
- Unless it's Pakistani poon.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.466
Am I right?

03:52.466 --> 03:55.969
Whoa!

03:55.969 --> 03:58.406
- Now, we know she's regularly
been confronting death

03:58.406 --> 03:59.573
with her aunt's cancer.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.409
Assuming she's fighting
for her life,

04:01.409 --> 04:03.644
fighting against finality.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.745
Whereas...

04:04.745 --> 04:05.813
- Hannah wants to euthanize
our love.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.180
- Yes.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.550
So we're gonna create a mini
crisis with a high recall

04:09.550 --> 04:10.784
probability.

04:10.784 --> 04:13.754
And transfer her fear of
losing her aunt to her

04:13.754 --> 04:15.789
relationship with you.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.492
- I have no idea what
you just said.

04:19.893 --> 04:22.996
- We're going to say that Sam
has cancer and that you're

04:22.996 --> 04:25.533
going to be the doctor who
says that the only cure

04:25.533 --> 04:27.635
is not breaking up with him.

04:27.635 --> 04:28.602
- That's manipulative.

04:28.602 --> 04:29.737
But I like it.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.204
- Can I still have a six-pack?

04:31.204 --> 04:32.906
- Larry, how much longer on
the current dream sequence?

04:32.906 --> 04:35.376
- LARRY: T-minus two minutos.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.377
- Wait, she's dreaming
right now?

04:36.377 --> 04:37.144
- Yep.

04:37.144 --> 04:42.082
In, uh, hatch number uno.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.451
- Hannah?

04:43.684 --> 04:44.418
Hannah, no.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.019
No, no, no, no, no!

04:46.019 --> 04:47.287
- What is it?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.922
- She's with another man
and they're having sex!

04:48.922 --> 04:50.524
- I gotta check this out.

04:51.592 --> 04:56.464
- [satisfied moans]

04:56.464 --> 04:57.665
- Oh, man, that's...

04:57.665 --> 04:59.132
that's Casper Van Dien!

04:59.132 --> 05:00.501
- Hannah.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.069
You totally made the right
decision in breaking up

05:02.069 --> 05:03.404
with Sam!

05:03.404 --> 05:06.340
- Oh! Casper! Yes!

05:06.874 --> 05:07.875
- Never surrender!

05:07.875 --> 05:09.677
Never retreat!

05:09.677 --> 05:12.413
- Never stop doing me!

05:12.546 --> 05:13.414
- Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.215
Did you say Casper Van Dien?

05:15.215 --> 05:17.851
Like Starship Troopers one
and three Casper Van Dien?

05:17.851 --> 05:18.719
- Yeah, and he's incredible
in Omega Code .

05:18.719 --> 05:19.687
- Will you get me his autograph?

05:19.687 --> 05:20.554
- Larry.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.623
Casper Van Dien is not real.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.191
He's just Hannah's mind
remembering seeing

05:24.191 --> 05:26.126
Starship Troopers earlier
in the day.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.562
And how the hell would I
bring an autograph back?

05:28.562 --> 05:29.797
- I... I dunno.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.965
I'm just a member of
the Casper fan Diens.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.468
- It's the Casper Van Dien
fan club.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.736
- Oh, shut the hell up, Larry!

05:35.736 --> 05:38.506
Guys, I need to get you
into hatch three pronto.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.109
- [satisfied grunting
and moaning]

05:42.109 --> 05:42.910
- Hannah!

05:42.910 --> 05:44.578
Tell me about your day.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.013
Tell me about your day!

05:46.013 --> 05:47.848
- I bought a pair of jeans.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.650
I'm worried I look
fat in them.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.852
- You look great in
every pair of jeans.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.956
- [satisfied scream]

05:56.824 --> 05:57.625
- Berkman.

05:57.625 --> 05:58.258
- Yeah.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.627
- [camera clicks]

05:59.627 --> 06:10.438
- [creaking noises and music]

06:10.438 --> 06:12.673
- Okay, now Sam, remember
you can't overtly state

06:12.673 --> 06:14.007
your desires.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.043
You have to let her subconscious
figure it out on its own

06:16.043 --> 06:17.845
otherwise it'll never stick
when she wakes up.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.079
- Sounds like a great plan.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.648
But uh...

06:20.648 --> 06:21.782
Who's this woman?

06:24.452 --> 06:26.954
- The jello is stale today.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.055
- Aunt Lisa?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.790
- Larry, what the hell
is going on?

06:29.790 --> 06:31.124
- I dunno!

06:31.124 --> 06:32.460
Hospitals must be a familiar
dream setting so her

06:32.460 --> 06:34.962
subconscious is just
auto-filling characters in.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.897
- Could you find that Latino
woman and get her to

06:36.897 --> 06:38.131
fluff my pillows?

06:38.131 --> 06:39.166
- What do we do?

06:39.166 --> 06:40.968
- We gotta get her
out of here now.

06:40.968 --> 06:41.835
Okay, let's go.

06:41.835 --> 06:42.670
- Whoa, Whoa!

06:42.670 --> 06:43.303
Easy, man.

06:43.303 --> 06:44.071
She's got cancer.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.138
- Oh, she's not real!

06:45.138 --> 06:46.073
Sam, get in bed.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.508
- Guys. Guys.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.242
The Van Dien bone session's
about to end and she seems

06:49.242 --> 06:51.144
very satisfied.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.813
- Your hair looks great!

06:52.813 --> 06:54.748
- [wild moaning]

06:54.748 --> 06:56.484
- That guy has got stamina, huh?

06:56.484 --> 06:58.118
- Oh my, you're so rough!

06:58.118 --> 06:59.887
- Shut up, dream woman!

06:59.887 --> 07:01.822
Remember the scenario!

07:01.822 --> 07:03.090
- Okay, got it.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.128
Hannah.

07:09.830 --> 07:10.698
How's it going?

07:10.698 --> 07:12.733
Or, uh...

07:12.733 --> 07:13.867
(weak) How's it going?

07:13.867 --> 07:16.069
- Sam?

07:16.069 --> 07:18.038
Sam, are you okay?

07:18.271 --> 07:19.940
- [coughing]

07:19.940 --> 07:21.274
- (weak) I'm sick, Hannah.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.844
I'm super... [coughing]

07:23.844 --> 07:25.212
super sick.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.780
- What's going on?

07:28.549 --> 07:31.785
- My apologies, but...

07:31.785 --> 07:32.820
It doesn't look good.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.088
- What is it, doctor?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.858
- He's dying.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.728
From a broken dick.

07:40.728 --> 07:41.562
- What?

07:41.562 --> 07:42.796
- What?!

07:43.296 --> 07:44.765
- Broken heart.

07:44.765 --> 07:45.733
Heart.

07:45.733 --> 07:46.934
- My heart...

07:46.934 --> 07:48.301
Hannah, it hurts.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.538
- HANNAH: Is there any cure,
doctor?

07:52.172 --> 07:53.273
- There's one thing.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.042
But it's very experimental.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.710
- Okay.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.579
- You would have to...

07:58.579 --> 08:00.080
sleep with his best friend,
Berkman.

08:00.080 --> 08:00.714
- What?

08:00.714 --> 08:02.650
Berkman, stop!

08:02.650 --> 08:03.984
- Berkman?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.586
I think I made out with
that guy Freshman year.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.754
I think he has crabs now.

08:06.754 --> 08:07.588
- No, he doesn't have crabs.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.321
If he did, it's treatable.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.790
- Shut up, shut up!

08:09.790 --> 08:12.225
Look, you just need to get
back together with Sam, okay?

08:12.225 --> 08:14.261
Sam is the only one who knows
how to treat you right.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.129
Like remember when I got you
all those tea tree candles

08:16.129 --> 08:17.598
from Costco last week?

08:17.598 --> 08:18.932
You love those candles.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.801
- Wait, what's going on?

08:20.801 --> 08:24.004
What is this?

08:24.004 --> 08:24.772
- AUNT: Hannah!

08:24.772 --> 08:26.874
Hannah, they're not real!

08:26.874 --> 08:28.141
Ahhhh.

08:28.141 --> 08:28.876
- Larry!

08:28.876 --> 08:29.910
Cancel the sequence now!

08:29.910 --> 08:31.812
- The scenario isn't
ready yet!

08:31.812 --> 08:32.479
- I don't care!

08:32.479 --> 08:33.781
Get us out now!

08:33.781 --> 08:34.882
- What?

08:34.882 --> 08:36.249
- Hannah!

08:36.249 --> 08:38.051
Hannah, take me back, please!

08:38.051 --> 08:40.187
Uh... Remember the good
times, Hannah please!

08:41.622 --> 08:42.890
- Wait, where'd she go?

08:42.890 --> 08:44.157
- Damn it, Sam.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.093
I told you not to explicitly
state anything,

08:46.093 --> 08:47.595
now her subconscious
is on to us.

08:47.595 --> 08:48.962
- It's his fault.

08:48.962 --> 08:49.930
What was all that "Berkman's
got your back" stuff?

08:49.930 --> 08:51.599
- Hey, I was just riffing
a bit...

08:51.599 --> 08:52.733
workshopping the script.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.167
- I hate you so much.

08:55.803 --> 08:56.536
- [thump]

08:56.536 --> 08:58.606
- What's that sound?

08:58.606 --> 08:59.607
- It's an interstitial.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.174
- A what?

09:01.174 --> 09:04.111
- Between REM cycles the mind
enters a hypnagogic state that-

09:04.111 --> 09:05.846
- Hey, bud, English.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.148
Otherwise it's gonna go
right over Sam's head.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.751
- Between all the big dreams you
have a lot of mini dreams.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.186
They're mostly just free
associative random bursts.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.622
- HANNAH: [startled grunting]

09:14.622 --> 09:15.288
- Hey! Hannah.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.489
How's it going?

09:16.489 --> 09:17.825
- What the fuck are you guys
doing here?

09:17.825 --> 09:18.826
- Oh.

09:18.826 --> 09:19.526
Well, uh...

09:19.526 --> 09:20.728
the three of us...

09:20.728 --> 09:22.095
Uh, we went to- It's
kind of hard to explain.

09:22.095 --> 09:22.996
We went-

09:22.996 --> 09:28.301
- [techno music]

09:28.301 --> 09:29.803
- What is this?

09:29.803 --> 09:32.305
- Everybody just hang tight,
this will be over in a second.

09:33.874 --> 09:34.908
- WOO!

09:34.908 --> 09:36.977
Yeah!

09:36.977 --> 09:45.385
- [techno music]

09:45.385 --> 09:46.286
- I'm gonna vomit!

09:47.254 --> 09:52.893
- [silence]

09:52.893 --> 09:54.161
- Is it over?

09:54.161 --> 09:55.295
- Okay, did you guys see
Charlie Chaplin kissing

09:55.295 --> 09:56.764
Abraham Lincoln?

09:56.764 --> 09:58.832
I mean open your eyes, they
are not gonna teach you that

09:58.832 --> 10:00.167
stuff in history books.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.669
- Larry.

10:01.669 --> 10:02.569
Where are we?

10:02.569 --> 10:04.237
This is not part of my design.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.339
- I've never seen this
simulation before.

10:06.339 --> 10:07.841
You're off the grid.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.376
- This doesn't seem that bad.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.311
- (in the distance) Ho ho ho!

10:11.311 --> 10:13.213
Feliz navidad!

10:13.213 --> 10:14.381
- Guys?

10:14.381 --> 10:15.448
Hannah.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.617
Her body is freaking
out up here.

10:18.085 --> 10:21.789
- (creepy laughter
in the distance)

10:23.223 --> 10:24.925
- Oh god.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.459
- Hannah's having a nightmare.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.362
- [suspense music]

10:29.362 --> 10:31.031
[silence]

10:31.031 --> 10:32.265
- MULLINS: Why...

10:32.265 --> 10:33.834
Santa?

10:34.334 --> 10:36.103
- Yeah, that's...

10:36.103 --> 10:37.370
Pretty fucking weird.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.206
- That's what you
think is weird?

10:39.206 --> 10:41.241
I tell you my ex-boyfriend
breaks into my brain,

10:41.241 --> 10:44.978
cues a nightmare, and your
first question is, "Why Santa?"

10:45.879 --> 10:49.116
- Why did you start dating Sam?

10:49.116 --> 10:51.318
- So now you want to hear
about my dating history?

10:51.318 --> 10:52.552
- Listen, Hannah.

10:52.552 --> 10:56.724
You see, Sam seems to think
your relationship

10:56.724 --> 10:58.726
is the reason why this
whole thing started.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.761
- Of course he does. [scoffs]

11:02.229 --> 11:04.364
- I thought you guys wanted
to hear about my nightmare.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.236
- [music]

11:09.236 --> 11:11.304
- Oh, this is bad, you guys.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.439
- Oh no.

11:15.042 --> 11:15.843
- Oh no.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.010
- Hannah!

11:17.010 --> 11:17.945
Don't freak out.

11:17.945 --> 11:18.578
What is this?

11:18.578 --> 11:20.013
Where are we?

11:20.013 --> 11:22.149
- This is my nightmare.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.084
From when I was eight.

11:24.084 --> 11:25.853
What are you guys doing here?

11:25.853 --> 11:27.788
- Well, uh, you're not gonna
believe it.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.156
But-

11:29.156 --> 11:30.690
- Sam hooked you up to
Connor's doggy dream machine

11:30.690 --> 11:33.326
which was originally my idea,
because he wanted to trick you

11:33.326 --> 11:34.995
into taking him back.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.296
- You did what?

11:36.296 --> 11:37.965
- Well, it sounds a lot
worse when he says it.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.199
Um...

11:39.199 --> 11:41.168
You were gonna give up on
us and I kinda panicked.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.169
But I had this machine that-

11:42.169 --> 11:44.037
- God damn it, Sam.

11:44.037 --> 11:44.772
This.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.406
This is the problem.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.241
This is why we broke up.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.911
You're so selfish.

11:50.911 --> 11:54.114
How do you not see that?

11:54.114 --> 11:55.182
- Oh...

11:55.182 --> 11:57.017
- [power drains]

11:57.017 --> 11:58.085
[alarms go off]

11:58.085 --> 11:59.987
- Oh, this is bad.

11:59.987 --> 12:00.988
- LARRY: We've got a problem.

12:00.988 --> 12:01.755
Everything's down.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.356
The system, the lights...

12:03.891 --> 12:04.992
We're on battery.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.193
- Oh shit.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.327
This is a full on night terror.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.561
We've gotta get
somewhere safe now.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.729
Come on!

12:10.463 --> 12:12.232
- LARRY: God dang it!

12:13.566 --> 12:15.168
Everything went red!

12:15.168 --> 12:16.336
Connor!

12:17.971 --> 12:19.139
- Okay.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.340
Hannah.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.509
Tell me everything you can
about this dream,

12:22.509 --> 12:25.545
and be very specific.

12:25.545 --> 12:26.479
- Okay.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.015
Okay.

12:28.015 --> 12:31.852
[breathing heavy]

12:31.852 --> 12:33.954
It was December 24th.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.388
1994.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.091
It was late.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.993
I was tired, but...

12:39.993 --> 12:41.028
I couldn't sleep.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.764
I was just too
excited about Santa.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.000
My mind was...

12:47.000 --> 12:48.435
racing.

12:48.435 --> 12:52.272
So I thought maybe if I
watched a movie it would help

12:52.272 --> 12:54.574
me go to sleep, or at least...

12:54.574 --> 12:58.011
pass the time until morning.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.780
Maybe I'd even see Santa
come down the chimney.

13:05.585 --> 13:08.288
So I snuck into
our living room.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.024
And turned on the TV.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.927
I searched for a
Christmas movie.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.428
I found one.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.430
One I'd never seen before.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.301
It was this slasher film
about an evil

13:21.301 --> 13:23.136
Mexican Santa Claus.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.838
- Feliz Navidead .

13:25.238 --> 13:26.473
- That's the one.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.176
I've had nightmares
ever since.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.045
The bodies.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.513
The blood.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.249
And that laugh.

13:37.517 --> 13:41.088
Ho. Ho. Ho.

13:42.555 --> 13:43.891
I still hate Christmas.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.395
- So... that's why you didn't
like my Christmas gift

13:48.395 --> 13:50.597
this year?

13:51.932 --> 13:53.433
- It was just a handwritten
coupon that said

13:53.433 --> 13:55.335
"Date night with Sam."

13:55.335 --> 13:57.004
- Redeemable any time.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.039
- Feliz Navidead is the one
where Santa kills all the

13:59.039 --> 14:00.573
villagers with the
candy cane knife.

14:00.573 --> 14:01.909
- No.

14:01.909 --> 14:02.642
It was the sequel.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.644
Yeah, it was the sequel.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.480
And in the sequel,
he kills them with a-

14:07.480 --> 14:12.585
- [chainsaw revving]
[screaming]

14:14.287 --> 14:15.688
- [crazy laughter]

14:15.688 --> 14:18.992
(speaking Spanish)

14:18.992 --> 14:21.061
[crazy laughter]

14:21.061 --> 14:23.330
- I'm about to lose
auxiliary power!

14:23.330 --> 14:25.132
We won't be able
to communicate!

14:25.132 --> 14:26.566
- [explosion]

14:28.301 --> 14:30.003
- Mexican Santa sucks!

14:30.003 --> 14:31.571
- Damn it!

14:33.706 --> 14:36.076
- So if we die in here,
do we also die out there?

14:36.076 --> 14:37.577
- Theoretically...

14:37.577 --> 14:38.711
Maybe.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.712
- Maybe?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.481
- Well, you could
wake up with a...

14:41.481 --> 14:43.283
cerebral hangover.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.551
- Well, that doesn't
sound that bad.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.186
- Where you uncontrollably
vomit and diarrhea

14:46.186 --> 14:47.420
for a day straight.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.655
- Well then I would just
die of embarrassment.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.923
- Wait!

14:49.923 --> 14:50.657
Why doesn't Larry just
take off our helmets?

14:50.657 --> 14:51.758
- No, no, he can't.

14:51.758 --> 14:54.327
The computer is not
at full power.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.963
If he takes the helmets off now,
we could scramble our

14:55.963 --> 14:56.896
brains together.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.065
You could wake up half Berkman.

14:58.065 --> 14:58.631
- Oh God...

14:58.631 --> 14:59.666
- Hey!

14:59.666 --> 15:00.300
- Larry.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.501
- Yeah, boss?

15:01.501 --> 15:03.203
- In the lab, back of the
fridge, there's an

15:03.203 --> 15:04.571
adrenaline shot.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.738
Get it and inject it directly
into Hannah's heart

15:05.738 --> 15:08.041
so we can wake up out of
this night terror.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.242
- Roger that.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.477
Oh, and Connor.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.245
You can count on me.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.381
- There is absolutely no
way we can count on him.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.615
We have to find a hatch.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.217
It could lead us back
to the Brain Frame.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.718
- Okay, let's do it.

15:18.718 --> 15:19.652
- Alright, the coast is clear.

15:19.652 --> 15:20.653
- Wait!

15:20.653 --> 15:22.122
Ladies first.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.590
- [screaming]

15:23.590 --> 15:29.997
- [chainsaw revving]
[screaming]

15:29.997 --> 15:31.164
- Fuck you, Santa!

15:31.164 --> 15:35.035
- [crazy laughter]

15:37.237 --> 15:38.505
- Adrenaline...

15:39.239 --> 15:40.240
Oh!

15:40.240 --> 15:41.474
Yes!

15:41.474 --> 15:42.209
- [glass breaking]

15:42.209 --> 15:43.543
- Oh no.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.279
Oh, classic Larry....

15:46.279 --> 15:47.480
Shit!

15:47.480 --> 15:48.681
- CONNOR: There's gotta be a
hatch somewhere.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.583
- You think you can
forgive me for this?

15:50.583 --> 15:51.251
- What?

15:51.251 --> 15:51.985
Are you insane?

15:51.985 --> 15:52.619
- We'll talk later.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.988
- Oh, guys, look!

15:56.156 --> 15:58.325
- [crazy laughter]

15:58.325 --> 16:00.160
(speaking Spanish)

16:00.160 --> 16:02.295
- No Santa, not again!

16:02.295 --> 16:07.534
- (speaking Spanish)

16:08.301 --> 16:10.670
- HANNAH: (speaking Spanish)

16:10.670 --> 16:12.305
Por favor, Santa.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.741
- It's only a dream.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.609
- [crazy laughter]

16:16.609 --> 16:18.711
- Hannah.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.713
You deserve better than me.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.182
You're right, I'm selfish.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.083
And needy.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.718
And my Christmas gift sucked.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.255
I just want you to be happy.

16:28.255 --> 16:29.289
I'm sorry.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.724
Hey!

16:31.724 --> 16:33.326
Jolly Saint Dick!

16:33.626 --> 16:35.428
You think you're scary?

16:35.428 --> 16:36.763
I think you're compensating
for something

16:36.763 --> 16:38.731
with that chainsaw, pal.

16:38.731 --> 16:39.732
- What's he doing?

16:39.732 --> 16:41.201
- He's negging Santa.

16:41.201 --> 16:44.337
- You obese, geriatric douche!

16:44.337 --> 16:45.838
You can't kill me.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.607
Because you're not real.

16:47.607 --> 16:51.111
None of this is!

16:51.111 --> 16:52.312
- [chainsaw revving]

16:52.312 --> 16:53.646
[crazy laughter]

16:53.646 --> 16:55.715
[chainsaw revving]

16:55.715 --> 16:56.816
- It's real.

16:56.816 --> 16:57.317
It's real.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.252
Run! Run!

17:01.121 --> 17:06.293
- (speaking Spanish)

17:06.293 --> 17:08.295
- [squish]

17:08.295 --> 17:11.464
- [Santa grunts]

17:11.464 --> 17:13.100
- [thud]

17:14.867 --> 17:16.136
- Come on, you apes.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.471
You wanna live forever?!

17:18.471 --> 17:20.840
- Casper Van Dien?

17:20.840 --> 17:22.809
- You still look great, Hannah.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.477
- Yeah, thank you
for saving us!

17:24.477 --> 17:26.279
- I saw you guys have sex,
I'm really sorry.

17:26.279 --> 17:29.682
- [music]

17:33.120 --> 17:34.287
- You did it.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.255
Larry, you did it.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.623
- Uh... yeah!
[glass shatters]

17:36.623 --> 17:38.225
Yeah, I did!

17:40.193 --> 17:43.396
- Uh, guys?

17:43.396 --> 17:44.697
What about Sam?

17:44.697 --> 17:46.499
- Is...

17:46.499 --> 17:48.601
is he dead?

17:50.603 --> 17:54.474
- He finally did something
un-selfish for me.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.675
And it killed him.

17:55.675 --> 17:56.643
- Oh god.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.545
What have I done?

18:02.549 --> 18:04.551
- [sharp exhale]

18:04.551 --> 18:06.119
- Sam.

18:07.487 --> 18:10.790
You were an okay boyfriend.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.726
Not the best, but... okay.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.597
You were always there for me.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.367
Even when I didn't
want you to be.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.403
Thank you for saving us, Sam.

18:25.572 --> 18:26.506
- [kiss smack]

18:26.506 --> 18:28.375
- [vomiting]

18:28.375 --> 18:29.376
Oh good Lord!

18:29.376 --> 18:30.843
- HANNAH: Oh...

18:30.843 --> 18:31.844
- He's not dead!

18:31.844 --> 18:32.712
- SAM: Oh god!

18:32.712 --> 18:33.946
- It's just a cerebral hangover!

18:33.946 --> 18:35.282
This is unprecedented.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.783
Larry, let's get those brain
wave readings right now!

18:36.783 --> 18:38.585
- [vomiting]

18:38.585 --> 18:39.852
- It's good to have you back,
bud.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.692
- Was I dreaming or did you
say I was a good boyfriend?

18:45.692 --> 18:47.394
- I think that was a dream.

18:47.394 --> 18:48.861
- Please just take me back.

18:48.861 --> 18:49.829
Please, come on.

18:49.829 --> 18:50.863
Just one more date.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.199
Please take me back.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.834
Please take me back,
I'm sorry I knocked you out,

18:54.834 --> 18:55.902
but please, please, please,
please, please!

18:55.902 --> 18:56.836
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

18:56.836 --> 18:57.770
Okay! Okay!

18:57.770 --> 18:58.605
One more!

18:58.605 --> 18:59.406
One more.

18:59.406 --> 19:00.940
- Yeah!

19:00.940 --> 19:03.976
- [flatulence and gurgles]

19:03.976 --> 19:07.547
[flatulence]

19:07.547 --> 19:08.281
[gurgles]

19:08.281 --> 19:09.015
- Wait, wait, wait.

19:09.015 --> 19:12.219
I did not shit my pants.

19:12.219 --> 19:13.353
- Who said I shit my pants?

19:13.353 --> 19:14.987
- He shat everywhere.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.022
It was disgusting.

19:16.022 --> 19:18.658
And I never agreed
to another date.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.159
- Hannah.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.962
We're not here to discuss how
bad you are at picking men.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.831
- MULLINS: You know what we
want to talk about.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.333
- Well, I'm not the
person to ask.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.768
- I was drunk and high most of
the time in that stupid lab

19:28.768 --> 19:30.002
so I don't remember.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.871
Really anything.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.573
- I am sick of this!

19:33.573 --> 19:34.974
Okay?

19:34.974 --> 19:37.677
We didn't break any laws,
we didn't do anything illegal.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.778
We were just experimenting.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.748
Harmless fun.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.352
Okay, a few things got
out of hand.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.386
- Out of hand?

19:46.386 --> 19:47.454
Out of hand?

19:47.454 --> 19:48.921
That's what you call this?

19:48.921 --> 19:55.695
- [music]

19:55.695 --> 19:59.198
[high winds and music]

19:59.932 --> 20:00.700
- Oh shit.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.468
- Shit.

20:01.468 --> 20:02.735
- Shit.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.938
- That's our lab, but...

20:05.938 --> 20:06.806
what is that thing?

20:06.806 --> 20:08.375
- You tell us.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.709
- Best case scenario...

20:09.709 --> 20:11.711
a temporary Einstein-Rosen
bridge.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.812
Nothing to be afraid of.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.180
- And worse case?

20:14.180 --> 20:15.648
- It's a black hole which will
envelop the planet,

20:15.648 --> 20:17.917
the solar system, and begin a
chain of events which will

20:17.917 --> 20:20.287
cause the implosion of the
entire universe.

20:20.287 --> 20:22.889
Also known as the Big Crunch.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.591
- How do we stop it?

20:24.591 --> 20:26.326
- I don't know.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.927
We don't even know
how it got started!

20:27.927 --> 20:29.462
- Then you're gonna tell us
every god damn thing

20:29.462 --> 20:30.763
you did in that lab.

20:30.763 --> 20:31.631
- Everything?

20:31.631 --> 20:32.265
- Everything?

20:32.265 --> 20:33.032
- Everything?

20:33.032 --> 20:34.801
- Every single thing?

20:34.801 --> 20:36.303
Because that's kind of
a lot of things.

20:36.303 --> 20:37.637
- Everything!

20:37.637 --> 20:42.542
- [intense music]

20:42.542 --> 20:45.412
[high winds and music]

20:45.412 --> 20:50.683
[silence]

20:50.683 --> 21:00.627
[instrumental music]

21:00.627 --> 21:10.637

21:10.637 --> 21:20.647

21:20.647 --> 21:30.657

21:30.657 --> 21:40.667
* *

21:40.667 --> 21:50.677

21:50.677 --> 22:00.687

22:00.687 --> 22:10.697

22:10.697 --> 22:18.571
