except yours.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.139
This doctor friend, tell me about him.

12:49.352 --> 12:53.186
He was the lead research scientist
on infectious diseases at USAMRIID.

12:53.398 --> 12:57.016
The foremost expert on the Cullen virus.
"Was." Now he's a criminal.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.772
No, the work he's done
has been criminalized,

12:59.946 --> 13:02.028
which is Why he left USAMRIID.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.403
But if anybody knows anything
about black-market viruses,

13:05.576 --> 13:07.441
it's Dr. Bruce Sanders.

13:08.538 --> 13:11.371
This is a copy
of Tom's code book.

13:11.582 --> 13:15.370
It was used to pass information
between Tom and his superiors.

13:15.545 --> 13:18.503
I had my associate Borakove
decode it.

13:18.715 --> 13:22.503
There's surprisingly little about myself
and my organization,

13:22.719 --> 13:25.631
but it contains speculation
about our cases

13:25.847 --> 13:27.508
and a great deal about you.

13:27.724 --> 13:33.185
I suggest you use some discretion
as to how you disclose any of it.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.853
It's an olive branch, Lizzy.

13:42.030 --> 13:46.319
Dembe, do you mind
trading seats with me?

13:54.542 --> 13:56.043
I just heard back from the CDC.

13:56.252 --> 13:59.665
The syringe found on our victim?
Well, it didn't contain the virus.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.666
It contained the cure.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.753
You're looking at the antidote
to the world's deadliest virus.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.669
Antidote? I thought the CDC said
there was no known cure.

14:07.889 --> 14:10.676
There wasn't, until this.
I don't understand.

14:10.892 --> 14:13.634
If Blankenship had the cure,
then why is he dead?

14:13.853 --> 14:16.845
Forensics pulled text messages
from Blankenship's cell.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.898
"Your next treatment is on its way.
Do yourjob on the 30th

14:20.068 --> 14:23.231
and treatments will continue."
"DO your job." What job?

14:23.404 --> 14:26.646
The 30th is tomorrow.
This isn't an outbreak. It's extortion.

14:26.824 --> 14:30.112
Blankenship was infected with a virus
and blackmailed for the antidote.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.699
Which he refused. This guy chose to die
instead of following orders.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.080
Why? Blackmailed for what?
To kill Reddington?

14:36.250 --> 14:39.663
Still seems like a bit of a reach.
Reddington was right about one thing.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.042
Whatever this Berlin is planning,
Blankenship was vital to it.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.458
And with him gone,
Berlin's gonna need a replacement.

he'd have to synthesize the molecules,

the one who infected Blankenship.

I'd hate for them to think
we're in cahoots.

39:24.320 --> 39:27.938
You don't always get to have your way.
You don't get out of this.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.363
Drop the weapon now!

39:33.246 --> 39:35.282
No way you're out of here.
You're surrounded.

39:35.498 --> 39:36.533
You Should go.

39:37.166 --> 39:40.249
If this is another one of your games

39:40.420 --> 39:42.752
to try to trick me
into forgiving you for Sam--

39:42.964 --> 39:44.204
AGENT:
Put the weapon down!

39:44.424 --> 39:45.709

--for what you've done

39:47.969 --> 39:49.675
You have ruined my life.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.049
And I swear to God,
right now I wanna kill you.

39:52.265 --> 39:55.428
But there are answers I need,
and I can't get them without you.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.725
And I can't get them without you.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.683
So I guess we're stuck with each other.

[CHUCKLING]

40:09.574 --> 40:12.657
I was once on the island of KO Ri,

40:12.869 --> 40:15.986
free-diving in the Andaman Sea.

40:16.873 --> 40:22.084
I fell terribly ill, stung by a Iionfish.

40:22.295 --> 40:26.004
I was dehydrated, in excruciating pain.

40:26.174 --> 40:30.042
I had lost all sense of time
and place.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.798
I was completely disoriented.

40:33.014 --> 40:38.475
But I knew I was dying,
so I readied myself for it.

40:38.686 --> 40:44.226
And in that moment,
at death's door, I looked up...

40:44.817 --> 40:48.560
and standing over me
in the brightness

40:49.530 --> 40:52.237
was this landless
Mawken sea gypsy,

40:52.450 --> 40:54.657
just standing there, smiling.

40:54.869 --> 40:59.158
She and her tribe nursed me
back to health, good as new.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.866
And when I left the island...

41:05.964 --> 41:07.420
she kissed me.

41:07.632 --> 41:11.841
It was like a burst of sunlight
on my cheek.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.045
It was...

41:24.148 --> 41:27.060
It made nearly dying well worth it.

41:30.196 --> 41:32.437
That's how I feel now.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.655
CONTROL:
Tiger Cat 51, you’re clear to engage.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.697
TIGER CAT 51:
Roger. Engaging the target.
