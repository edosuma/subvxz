WEBVTT

00:08.341 --> 00:09.808
Just look sexy, please.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.343
- Come on.
- You always look sexy.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.546
God, I'm so happy
I married you.

00:19.319 --> 00:21.387
What are they going
to do to me in there?

00:21.389 --> 00:22.454
If you stop taking pictures

00:22.456 --> 00:25.190
and come inside, we can find out.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.359
- This place is amazing.
- You think we're still going to want

00:27.361 --> 00:28.961
to bang each other
when we're 80?

00:28.963 --> 00:31.163
Uh, you better. Otherwise
I'm going to leave your ass.

00:31.165 --> 00:33.198
Admit it.
I'm the best you've ever had.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.466
Actually, there was this one guy...

00:34.468 --> 00:36.502
Shut up. Shut up.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.170
You are so sexy.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.738
Come on.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.306
Let's go inside.

00:41.308 --> 00:43.509
Last stop on
the haunted honeymoon tour.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.511
Better make it good.
Mm-hmm.

00:45.513 --> 00:48.947
# Here comes the bride #

01:00.994 --> 01:02.561
Built in 1908,

01:02.563 --> 01:04.997
Briarcliff Manor was
the largest tuberculosis ward

01:04.998 --> 01:06.698
on the East Coast.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.600
46,000 people died here.

01:08.602 --> 01:09.835
You think it's haunted?

01:09.837 --> 01:11.370
They shuttle the bodies

01:11.372 --> 01:12.938
out through an underground tunnel

01:12.940 --> 01:14.506
called "the death chute."

01:14.508 --> 01:17.109
We should totally do it
in the death chute.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.577
Oh, my God, you are so demented.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.045
I love you.

01:20.047 --> 01:21.713
What are we going to tell
our kids about the honeymoon?

01:21.715 --> 01:23.348
Tell them the truth.

01:23.350 --> 01:26.418
How we visited the 12
most haunted places in America

01:26.420 --> 01:27.953
and screwed our brains out
in every single one.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.588
Or that Mommy's a horror freak

01:29.590 --> 01:31.590
and Daddy lives to
make Mommy happy?

01:31.592 --> 01:32.958
Mmm, he does.
Mm-hmm.

01:39.732 --> 01:42.201
Come on. Let's keep exploring.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.369
All right.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.238
We got an hour before sunset.
Let's make it quick.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.408
The Catholic Church
bought this place in '62

01:49.410 --> 01:54.446
and turned it into a sanitarium
for the criminally insane.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.382
Legend has it that once you
are committed at Briarcliff,

01:57.384 --> 01:59.585
you never got out.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.620
Their most famous resident

02:01.622 --> 02:03.122
was a serial killer.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.423
Bloody Face.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.658
Say "Bloody Face."

02:06.660 --> 02:08.327
Bloody Face.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.104
Teresa!

02:19.106 --> 02:22.441
You got to see this penny chair.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.576
Oh-ho.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.546
Tie my down.

02:28.581 --> 02:29.515
I'm sick, Doctor.

02:29.517 --> 02:30.749
Can you help me?

02:30.751 --> 02:32.518
I don't know.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.019
You seem to have a very bad case

02:34.021 --> 02:36.020
of morbid erotomania.

02:39.592 --> 02:40.926
Ready for your injection?

02:50.370 --> 02:52.004
What is that?

02:52.006 --> 02:54.139
What is that?

02:54.141 --> 02:55.674
I don't... um... What is that?
Let's go see.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.642
No, no, no, no...

02:56.644 --> 02:57.643
Come on.

02:57.645 --> 02:58.644
No, come on. Let's go.

02:58.646 --> 02:59.845
You're killing me.

02:59.847 --> 03:00.745
Promise I'll make it up to you.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.548
No, you swear we're coming back.
Promise me we're coming back.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.549
- I promise, I promise.
- Okay.

03:03.551 --> 03:04.783
Maybe it's Bloody Face.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.552
Maybe it's just old pipes.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.453
You can totally put it
in my ass right now.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.556
Wow.

03:11.991 --> 03:13.759
Oh, come on.

03:15.828 --> 03:16.895
I can't see.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.665
Hey, take it easy.
Take it easy.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.667
What, you scared? Pussy.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.570
So tight.

03:26.806 --> 03:28.707
Oh, my God!
What? What? What?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.409
Oh, you are such a prick.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.577
You are

03:31.579 --> 03:32.544
such a prick.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.979
Speaking of which...

03:33.981 --> 03:36.582
No, I want to know
what's in there.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.683
Do it again and I'll blow you.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.652
Give me your phone.

04:07.879 --> 04:12.879

<font color=#D2942C>Welcome To Briarcliff</font>

05:24.325 --> 05:26.658
That'll be three dollars even.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.327
30 cents a gallon.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.528
You think because you're
out here in the toolies

05:29.530 --> 05:31.029
you can gouge people?

05:31.031 --> 05:32.531
I don't set the prices, sir.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.132
Kids get a coloring book?

05:34.134 --> 05:35.367
Yeah, that be Texaco.

05:35.369 --> 05:36.868
Come on, Jack.
I just want to go home.

05:36.870 --> 05:37.869
Whoa.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.339
Nice.

05:40.341 --> 05:41.306
Drive safely.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.211
Asshole.

05:46.213 --> 05:50.382
# Do-da-do-do, bow, bow #

05:50.384 --> 05:51.550
# Do-da-do-do,
bow, bow #

05:51.552 --> 05:53.785
# Do-do-da-do #

05:53.787 --> 05:56.455
# There goes my baby #

05:56.457 --> 06:01.193
# Moving on down the line #

06:01.195 --> 06:04.363
# Wondering where, wondering where #

06:04.365 --> 06:08.033
# Wondering where she is bound #

06:08.035 --> 06:11.370
# I broke her heart #

06:11.372 --> 06:14.806
# And made her cry #

06:14.808 --> 06:17.676
# Now I belong #

06:20.047 --> 06:21.580
Sign says closed.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.248
# What did I do? #

06:23.250 --> 06:25.684
# There goes my baby #

06:25.686 --> 06:27.753
# Whoa-oh-oh #

06:27.755 --> 06:29.020
# There goes my baby #

06:29.022 --> 06:30.322
# There #

06:30.324 --> 06:34.393
# There goes my baby,
oh-oh-oh.... #

06:40.867 --> 06:42.734
Boo!
Christ, Billy!

06:42.736 --> 06:44.703
Trying to get killed?

06:44.705 --> 06:46.338
Do you know what
I keeps in this cabinet?

06:46.340 --> 06:48.440
Look anything like this?

06:48.442 --> 06:49.741
- Geez, give me... Give me that.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh,

06:49.743 --> 06:52.377
Ooh!

06:52.379 --> 06:54.179
We just want to borrow it.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.181
Nigger try to mess
with Randy's little sister.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.352
- Are you guys insane?
- Come on, Kit.

07:00.354 --> 07:01.887
We're just gonna scare him,
come with us.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.121
I'm not going with you guys.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.356
And neither is the gun.

07:04.358 --> 07:05.924
So, just leave.

07:12.031 --> 07:14.032
How much is Al paying
you these days?

07:14.034 --> 07:17.936
I hear you got yourself a maid.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.371
That's what I hear anyway.

07:24.410 --> 07:27.946
Mmm.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.515
Chocolate.

08:09.121 --> 08:12.491
Something smells good,
Mrs. Walker.

08:12.493 --> 08:14.526
I'm not to you putting
those two words together.

08:14.528 --> 08:15.660
But I like it,

08:15.662 --> 08:17.329
Mr. Walker.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.064
Aw.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.471
So, how are you?

08:26.473 --> 08:27.873
Good.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.140
How are you?

08:29.142 --> 08:30.208
I'm good.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.414
Let's do it, babe.

08:37.383 --> 08:38.616
Let's tell everyone.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.652
Come on. We didn't
commit a crime.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.821
We drove to Provincetown
and got married.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.490
Your family, my folks--
they should know.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.158
The world will change one day.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.061
The world is wrong.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.830
We need to keep it a secret.

08:54.568 --> 08:57.002
Baby...

08:57.004 --> 08:59.971
it makes me feel like
I can't protect my own family.

09:05.978 --> 09:07.412
The roast is just about ready.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.748
That's not what I'm hungry for.

09:20.092 --> 09:21.493
I can't take... damn it...

09:42.448 --> 09:43.715
Oh, babe.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.717
I hope you like
your beef tough and dry

09:45.719 --> 09:47.285
because that's what I want
for dinner tonight.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.554
The first course was delicious.

09:49.556 --> 09:54.225
# Showing off their silver leaves #

09:54.227 --> 09:58.096
# As we walked by #

09:58.098 --> 10:00.432
Mmm.

10:00.434 --> 10:03.101
# Soft kisses on a summer's day #

10:03.103 --> 10:04.569
Where you going?

10:04.571 --> 10:05.870
To make you dinner.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.439
Okay.

10:11.577 --> 10:15.814
# They say that all good things
must end #

10:17.484 --> 10:21.386
# ...someday #

10:22.655 --> 10:24.656
Shit!

10:27.093 --> 10:29.160
Alma, you stay in the kitchen
no matter what, you hear me?

10:36.770 --> 10:38.970
I know you're out here, Billy.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.672
Stop playing games.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.686
Alma!

10:54.688 --> 10:57.822
Help me! Help me!

10:57.824 --> 10:59.290
Alma!

10:59.292 --> 11:01.326
Alma, answer me!

11:01.328 --> 11:02.594
Where are you?

11:04.331 --> 11:05.697
Aah!

11:40.299 --> 11:41.833
Lana Winters from the <i>Gazette.</i>

11:41.835 --> 11:43.468
I'm doing a story on your bakery,

11:43.470 --> 11:45.704
and I have an appointment
with Sister Jude.

12:10.996 --> 12:12.664
Play with me!

12:15.935 --> 12:17.736
Play with me!

12:17.738 --> 12:18.770
Ow!

12:18.772 --> 12:20.572
Pepper, leave the lady alone.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.706
Oh, it's fine.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.575
She was only trying
to make friends.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.410
It was harmless.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.578
She's not harmless.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.447
She drowned her sister's baby
and sliced his ears off.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.648
Follow me, miss.

12:34.787 --> 12:38.890
No! No!

12:38.892 --> 12:41.092
I don't want to go to bed!

12:41.094 --> 12:44.529
Sister Jude calls this
her "stairway to heaven."

12:49.101 --> 12:50.702
Leave me alone!

13:02.615 --> 13:04.549
A lady reporter...!

13:06.085 --> 13:10.155
Told you I would come find
you, Sister Mary Eunice.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.956
Brush yourself off, Shelly.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.258
Do you think

13:13.260 --> 13:14.993
I'm full of shame and regret

13:14.995 --> 13:16.561
for what I've done now, Sister?

13:16.563 --> 13:18.129
You could shave me bald as a cue ball,

13:18.131 --> 13:20.465
and I'll still be the hottest
tamale in this joint.

13:23.335 --> 13:24.936
Take her to the common room
so the others

13:24.938 --> 13:27.972
can witness her
newfound immaculacy.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.307
And next time, knock.

13:30.242 --> 13:32.744
Remind me of your name.

13:32.746 --> 13:34.946
Lana. Lana Winters.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.848
Can I ask what Shelly did?

13:36.850 --> 13:38.783
I assume you were
punishing her for something.

13:38.785 --> 13:41.619
I assumed you were here
to do a story on our bakery.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.021
Oh, believe me, no one loves

13:43.023 --> 13:44.656
that molasses bread
more than I do.

13:44.658 --> 13:48.760
I toast it for my breakfast
every single morning.

13:48.762 --> 13:50.962
Shelley was brought to us
having been given

13:50.964 --> 13:53.932
the preposterous diagnosis
by a psychiatrist

13:53.934 --> 13:56.201
comparing her to a wood nymph.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.503
You mean a nymphomaniac?

13:58.505 --> 13:59.771
Just more nonsense
from the charlatans.

13:59.773 --> 14:03.007
That young woman is a victim
of her own lust.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.109
There's no other name for it.

14:05.111 --> 14:10.815
Mental illness is the
fashionable explanation for sin.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.452
You said your name's Lana?

14:14.454 --> 14:15.887
After the movie star?

14:15.889 --> 14:18.056
Now there's a train
wreck of a soul.

14:18.058 --> 14:21.125
Jennifer Jones, however,
there's a true lady.

14:21.127 --> 14:23.494
You've seen <i>Song of Bernadette?</i>

14:23.496 --> 14:25.196
Oh, it's a classic.
Yeah.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.632
But at Briarcliff,
I hear you're the true star.

14:27.634 --> 14:31.035
Oh, no, not me.
The monsignor, Timothy Howard.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.905
He's the real visionary.
Sit down. You make me nervous.

14:33.907 --> 14:37.141
You know what this place was
just two years ago?

14:37.143 --> 14:38.543
A hellhole!

14:38.545 --> 14:40.044
And I'm told the bakery
was your idea.

14:40.046 --> 14:43.047
It was, but it was based
on his philosophy.

14:43.849 --> 14:44.816
Well, write it down.

14:44.818 --> 14:46.184
He believes the tonic

14:46.186 --> 14:50.188
for a diseased mind
lies in the three "P's":

14:50.190 --> 14:52.757
productivity, prayer,
and purification.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.759
The bakery's just the tip
of the iceberg.

14:54.761 --> 14:58.062
Oh, we have such dreams
for this place.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.231
Are all your patients
remanded here by the state?

15:01.700 --> 15:03.067
Not all.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.936
The monsignor's
a man of charity.

15:04.938 --> 15:07.405
You know where most
of our wards come from?

15:07.407 --> 15:08.406
The gutter.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.576
They said to tell you that the...

15:11.578 --> 15:14.212
Oh, I didn't knock.
I'm sorry, Sister.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.580
You were sent to tell me what?

15:15.582 --> 15:17.582
Sent to tell you...
What?

15:17.584 --> 15:20.885
The bad person will arrive any minute.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.320
Thank you, Sister.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.790
Well, are we ready
for our bakery tour?

15:25.792 --> 15:27.725
She's talking about the maniac,

15:27.727 --> 15:29.861
the killer of those women,
isn't she? Bloody Face.

15:29.863 --> 15:31.396
Bloody Face?

15:31.398 --> 15:32.530
An eyewitness caught
a glimpse of him

15:32.532 --> 15:33.898
leaving one of the crime scenes
wearing a mask,

15:33.900 --> 15:36.267
which appeared to be made of
human flesh. I heard he's going

15:36.269 --> 15:38.236
to be admitted here today.
Is there any way I can meet him?

15:38.238 --> 15:40.038
You're not in the least bit
interested in our good works.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.439
Our town's in a collective panic.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.242
This maniac is decapitating
women, three of them so far.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.311
I see you for exactly who you are.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.780
Three minutes.
Give me three minutes with him,

15:48.782 --> 15:50.882
and I swear to God
I will write an amazing...

15:50.884 --> 15:52.650
Swear to God?!
It's rich coming from you.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.919
People want to understand what's
in the mind of someone like him.

15:54.921 --> 15:57.221
- There's not a pious bone in your body.
- Where's the harm in that?

15:57.223 --> 16:00.491
You're out of your depth,
Miss Lana Banana.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.094
You want a story?
Write this down.

16:03.096 --> 16:06.597
<i>Your killer is being turned</i>
<i>over to us by the authorities</i>

16:06.599 --> 16:11.502
<i>until it is determined whether</i>
<i>he is fit to stand trial.</i>

16:57.883 --> 17:02.286
It's an ordeal, I know--
our check-in procedures.

17:02.288 --> 17:07.058
Though, not a patch on what you
put your victims through.

17:07.060 --> 17:11.194
Sister, I didn't kill anybody.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.865
The guards have given you
over to my care.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.000
Not for correction,
but for storage

17:16.002 --> 17:17.667
while they weigh your fate.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.704
This is not a meat locker.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.074
Here, you will repent
for your crimes

17:23.076 --> 17:25.910
to the only judge that matters:

17:25.912 --> 17:27.545
the Almighty God.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.247
There is no God.

17:30.582 --> 17:34.152
Not a God who would create
the things I saw.

17:34.154 --> 17:37.055
Your story about
little green men?

17:37.057 --> 17:39.490
No, never will do here.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.160
They weren't human.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.928
They were monsters.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.898
All monsters are human.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.166
You're a monster.

17:52.171 --> 17:53.704
I wonder...

17:53.706 --> 17:57.909
did her dark meat
slide off the bone

17:57.911 --> 17:59.710
any easier than
your other victims?

18:07.453 --> 18:10.455
You're gonna wish
you hadn't done that.

18:13.559 --> 18:18.029
# Dominique-inique-inique
s'en allait tout simplement #

18:18.031 --> 18:21.065
# Routier, pauvre et chantant #

18:21.067 --> 18:24.569
# En tous chemins,
en tous lieux, il ne parle #

18:24.571 --> 18:25.470
Ass munch!

18:25.472 --> 18:30.041
Ooh, Sister Jude
is on the warpath!

18:30.043 --> 18:31.042
Hey, stop it!

18:31.044 --> 18:33.044
Can't make the
welts go away,

18:33.046 --> 18:35.213
but I can make you
forget you had 'em.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.148
The nurse already
gave me a salve.

18:37.150 --> 18:40.451
A salve can't cure you
like I can... in your session

18:40.453 --> 18:42.086
in the hydrotherapy
room with me.

18:42.088 --> 18:44.055
I speak French... and Greek.

18:44.057 --> 18:45.990
Will you beat it?!

18:45.992 --> 18:48.292
He's mine.
He's mine!

18:48.294 --> 18:51.996
# Il ne parle que du Bon Dieu #

18:51.998 --> 18:57.101
# Certain jour un hÃ¨rÃ¨tique
par des ronces le conduit #

18:57.103 --> 19:01.906
# Mais notre pÃ¨re Dominique
par sa joie le convertit #

19:01.908 --> 19:03.474
I can't take this.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.010
# S'en allait
tout simplement... #

19:06.012 --> 19:07.778
Don't touch that.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.247
Any one of them
will sell you out.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.182
They get a piece of candy,
you get another

19:11.184 --> 19:13.084
five welts on your ass.
It's a rule.

19:13.086 --> 19:15.620
As long as the common room
is open, the song plays.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.955
There's a rule for everything here.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.824
I learned them all the hard way,

19:19.826 --> 19:21.259
trust me.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.161
Why should I trust you?

19:23.163 --> 19:25.129
Because I'm not crazy.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.131
Hey, Bloody Face,
you're him, right?

19:27.133 --> 19:29.634
You must be
the most dangerous man here.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.035
I heard you skinned them alive.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.770
The last one, a colored girl.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.239
I guess you didn't like her color.

19:36.942 --> 19:39.343
Fight, fight, fight!

19:40.279 --> 19:42.146
Get off of him!

19:42.148 --> 19:46.984
Fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight!

20:08.073 --> 20:09.307
He started it.

20:14.746 --> 20:19.317
# Dominique-inique-inique
s'en allait tout simplement #

20:19.319 --> 20:21.319
No. No!

20:43.108 --> 20:46.844
Psst! Hey, you gotta eat.

20:57.055 --> 20:58.923
How'd you get back here?

20:58.925 --> 21:01.525
Kitchen detail.

21:01.527 --> 21:04.962
I volunteered. Here.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.107
Why are you being
so nice to me?

21:16.109 --> 21:19.076
What you put out into the
world comes back to you.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.245
So what'd you put
out into the world

21:21.247 --> 21:23.180
to get locked up
in a place like this?

21:24.116 --> 21:26.817
They say I chopped up
my family.

21:28.387 --> 21:30.154
You gonna ask?

21:30.156 --> 21:31.756
Did you?

21:31.758 --> 21:34.225
No.

21:34.227 --> 21:36.160
Did you murder your wife?

21:36.162 --> 21:38.629
No, I'm not crazy.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.832
That's unfortunate.
They decide you're sane,

21:41.834 --> 21:43.934
you're going someplace
way worse than this.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.436
What could be worse than this?

21:45.438 --> 21:47.672
You think it's bad
not having a chair?

21:47.674 --> 21:50.641
Just think of the one
they'll strap you into.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.978
I'll try to come back later.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.980
Hey!

21:55.982 --> 21:57.982
What's your name?

21:57.984 --> 22:00.151
Grace.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.492
He's gone.
Willie's gone.

22:08.494 --> 22:11.128
There was a medical
emergency last night.

22:11.130 --> 22:13.331
I didn't even know he was sick.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.999
Why wasn't I informed?

22:16.336 --> 22:18.169
Dr. Arden asked

22:18.171 --> 22:21.072
to have him taken
directly t-to his wing.

22:23.275 --> 22:25.009
I demand you give me access
to your laboratory.

22:25.011 --> 22:27.778
When the monsignor
brought me out of retirement

22:27.780 --> 22:30.648
to run Briarcliff's medical unit,

22:30.650 --> 22:32.049
we made a gentlemen's agreement.

22:32.051 --> 22:35.152
Curious, since only one
of you is a gentleman.

22:35.154 --> 22:37.621
Please look at me when I speak to you.

22:37.623 --> 22:39.490
I'm not one of your charges, Sister,

22:39.492 --> 22:41.058
quaking in my boots.

22:42.527 --> 22:43.961
Do you have any idea what this is?

22:43.963 --> 22:45.963
It's a plant.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.698
A little Elena.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.867
This particular strain of <i>Alstroemeria</i>

22:49.869 --> 22:51.802
has never existed before.

22:51.804 --> 22:55.206
It was created by bombarding
the plant with gamma rays.

22:55.208 --> 22:58.876
It is an affirmation of the
power of science over nature.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.579
Your little mutation
doesn't change the fact

23:01.581 --> 23:04.582
that in order for this
institution to thrive,

23:04.584 --> 23:06.717
I need to manage your operation.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.052
Sister...

23:08.054 --> 23:10.020
if you could manage
to stay out of my business,

23:10.022 --> 23:12.022
I'll try and stay out of yours.

23:12.024 --> 23:14.392
Let's discuss another matter:

23:14.394 --> 23:16.861
the patients, four of them,

23:16.863 --> 23:18.195
including Willie last night,

23:18.197 --> 23:20.498
have disappeared
under your supervision.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.866
They died.

23:21.868 --> 23:24.101
That's it? Period?
No explanation.

23:24.103 --> 23:27.872
Patients committed here
suffer not only

23:27.874 --> 23:30.241
diseases of the mind,
but also of the body.

23:30.243 --> 23:33.110
Where are the bodies?

23:33.112 --> 23:35.079
Cremated.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.415
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

23:37.417 --> 23:40.518
Cause of death documented
in their death certificates.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.952
I find it interesting

23:41.954 --> 23:43.921
that of all the patients that died

23:43.923 --> 23:45.289
since you've been here,

23:45.291 --> 23:47.024
none have family.

23:47.026 --> 23:48.292
No one to grieve

23:48.294 --> 23:50.127
or to ask questions.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.962
I think you're lying.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.365
And in time, whatever
it is you're hiding

23:54.367 --> 23:56.133
will come to see the light of day.

23:56.135 --> 23:59.136
I've dealt with bigger monsters
than you, Doctor.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.975
Let me give you fair warning:

24:04.977 --> 24:06.644
I'll always win

24:06.646 --> 24:09.580
against the patriarchal male.

24:09.582 --> 24:12.049
Bully for you.

24:19.958 --> 24:23.060
I am telling you, Wendy,
that battle-axe has secrets.

24:23.062 --> 24:26.597
Under all that piousness
and fidelity...

24:26.599 --> 24:28.999
there's a real darkness.

24:31.169 --> 24:32.770
Getting high before dinner?

24:32.772 --> 24:35.473
Makes your food taste better.

24:35.475 --> 24:38.442
If your gut says there's
a story, then there is.

24:38.444 --> 24:41.445
Blow the lid off the place like
Maisel did with "Bedlam 1946."

24:41.447 --> 24:43.080
Get yourself a Pulitzer.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.114
Problem is...

24:44.116 --> 24:45.583
your editor won't let you do it.

24:45.585 --> 24:46.984
Emmerman's an asshole.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.018
He thinks that
Canada geese

24:48.020 --> 24:49.587
leaving Chicopee a month early

24:49.589 --> 24:51.255
is a Column "A" story,

24:51.257 --> 24:52.823
and he wants me to write
the cooking column.

24:52.825 --> 24:53.958
Your cooking is horrible.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.160
Why do you think
I never eat it?

24:58.797 --> 25:01.966
I'm not doing this
for Emmerman.

25:01.968 --> 25:03.767
I write it on my own,

25:03.769 --> 25:06.470
and I get it out to
<i>Life</i> or <i>Look.</i>

25:06.472 --> 25:07.605
This is my shot.

25:07.607 --> 25:10.674
I know, baby,
and I am behind you 100%.

25:10.676 --> 25:13.844
If you need to take some time
off to get this story done,

25:13.846 --> 25:16.413
I want you to do it.

25:19.317 --> 25:21.886
The blinds are open.

25:22.621 --> 25:24.622
No one can see.

25:26.124 --> 25:27.491
The pot's making you paranoid.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.727
You think the PTA is going to be cool

25:29.729 --> 25:31.896
if they find out a dyke is teaching

25:31.898 --> 25:33.697
little Bobby and Suzie science?

25:33.699 --> 25:36.367
I mean, I have to fight to get
evolution on the curriculum.

25:36.369 --> 25:37.801
You're right.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.236
I'm sorry.

25:46.077 --> 25:48.479
Anything I do in my life,

25:48.481 --> 25:50.714
I can do because you love me.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.383
I know, baby.

25:56.721 --> 25:58.656
So how are you gonna get in?

26:01.393 --> 26:03.160
Hail, Mary, full of grace,

26:03.162 --> 26:04.328
the Lord is with thee.

26:04.330 --> 26:07.064
<i>Blessed art thou among women,</i>

26:07.066 --> 26:09.166
<i>and blessed is the fruit</i>
<i>of thy womb, Jesus.</i>

26:09.168 --> 26:11.068
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

26:11.070 --> 26:12.903
pray for us sinners,

26:12.905 --> 26:15.239
now and at the
hour of our death.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.340
Amen.

26:49.741 --> 26:52.610
You are a <i>rara avis,</i>
Sister Jude.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.745
What does that mean?

26:54.747 --> 26:56.280
It means "rare bird."

26:56.282 --> 26:58.148
In Latin.

26:58.150 --> 27:01.318
And it's a compliment
or a criticism?

27:01.320 --> 27:03.587
It's a compliment.

27:03.589 --> 27:06.123
Most women of the cloth
feel they have to deny

27:06.125 --> 27:08.325
all sensory life when
they take their vows.

27:10.261 --> 27:12.096
No.

27:12.098 --> 27:14.798
I've renounced spirits.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.134
Are you sure?
Your cooking reveals

27:17.136 --> 27:19.103
an almost decadent palate.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.304
"Decadent."

27:20.306 --> 27:21.639
Is that a subtle
reprimand, Father?

27:21.641 --> 27:23.240
Oh, you know me
better than that.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.275
I always say what I mean.

27:25.277 --> 27:26.710
I'd appreciate the same from you.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.849
As usual, you've seen
right through me, Father.

27:31.851 --> 27:34.318
When you put me in charge here,

27:34.320 --> 27:35.519
I thought your faith in me

27:35.521 --> 27:39.189
was based on our
mutually shared vision

27:39.191 --> 27:41.258
of madness as a spiritual crisis,

27:41.260 --> 27:43.327
an absence of God.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.862
That remains true.

27:44.864 --> 27:49.033
I want to know where
you found... Dr. Arden.

27:49.035 --> 27:51.468
He is not a man of God.

27:51.470 --> 27:52.803
The Church approved him.

27:52.805 --> 27:54.438
He was sent here by people

27:54.440 --> 27:57.007
better equipped to judge
his godliness than you.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.179
Say what you will,

28:02.181 --> 28:05.215
your rare bird has a nose for rodents.

28:05.217 --> 28:08.552
You mustn't be so fearful.

28:08.554 --> 28:10.120
It was God, after all,

28:10.122 --> 28:12.222
who created both
science and Heaven.

28:12.224 --> 28:15.292
God put the idea
in a doctor's head

28:15.294 --> 28:18.028
to create the antibiotic
that cured tuberculosis.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.798
These are amazing times, if you
just look at it in another light.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.199
There is no other light.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.168
We're literally almost
on the moon.

28:24.170 --> 28:27.204
Our dear departed
John F. Kennedy, a Catholic,

28:27.206 --> 28:28.972
was elected President.

28:28.974 --> 28:30.307
This is a time
when anything can happen,

28:30.309 --> 28:31.742
if someone wants it enough.

28:31.744 --> 28:35.412
But what on earth do we want,
if not to save souls?

28:38.516 --> 28:42.052
Here's... what I want.

28:43.188 --> 28:46.990
I want this institution
to become a place

28:46.992 --> 28:49.660
of such promise and renown
that we are asked

28:49.662 --> 28:53.030
to be Cardinal of New York.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.198
"We?"

28:54.200 --> 28:55.999
Wherever I go, you go.

28:56.001 --> 28:57.434
You're my right hand.

28:58.603 --> 29:01.038
You'll become Mother Superior,

29:01.040 --> 29:02.539
overseeing thousands of nuns

29:02.541 --> 29:04.875
who will address you
as "Reverend Mother."

29:04.877 --> 29:07.111
And then, with God
and you on my side...

29:09.715 --> 29:11.849
I see no reason
why I couldn't ascend

29:11.851 --> 29:13.784
to the office of first
Anglo-American Pope.

29:16.121 --> 29:18.122
You'd enjoy Rome.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.857
Wouldn't you, Sister?

29:39.778 --> 29:41.612
<i>I need you to be a team player.</i>

29:44.215 --> 29:46.150
The doctor needs full oversight
of his domain.

29:46.152 --> 29:50.187
You... look after yours.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.975
<i>Can you hear them?</i>

30:11.977 --> 30:13.510
They sound like
they're getting hungrier.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.312
It's to be expected.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.314
The weather's changing.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.649
They'll need some meat.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.518
<i>What are they?</i>

30:21.520 --> 30:23.387
<i>Do you trust me?</i>

30:25.123 --> 30:27.224
Good.

30:34.332 --> 30:36.533
You're always in
such a hurry, Sister.

30:37.602 --> 30:39.703
Why are you out
so late at night?

30:39.705 --> 30:41.171
Oh, please don't
tell Sister Jude.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.107
What is that?
Some kind of animal?

30:44.109 --> 30:45.909
We can't stay here.
We have to go.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.054
Ugh...

31:02.493 --> 31:04.528
Grace?

31:08.500 --> 31:10.400
- Ah!
- Quiet, son.

31:10.402 --> 31:11.802
You don't belong in here.

31:13.238 --> 31:15.539
Not when there's so much to learn.

31:24.816 --> 31:26.583
Am I bleeding out?

31:26.585 --> 31:28.051
We got to get you back into town.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.087
It's only five miles away.

31:30.089 --> 31:31.922
Leo! Leo?
Don't fall asleep.

31:31.924 --> 31:34.057
Come on, baby.
Can you make it to the car?

31:34.059 --> 31:35.993
Come on...
Oh!

31:41.099 --> 31:42.766
Where's your phone?

31:42.768 --> 31:44.668
Is that in your car?

31:44.670 --> 31:45.936
Leo!

31:45.938 --> 31:47.271
Okay, I'll be right back.

32:16.401 --> 32:18.869
This way. Hurry.

32:18.871 --> 32:20.237
What is this place?

32:20.239 --> 32:23.774
It's my shortcut from the woods.

32:26.244 --> 32:28.879
What were you feeding out there?

32:32.951 --> 32:34.718
I guess I'll have to ask Sister Jude.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.219
Why?

32:36.221 --> 32:37.254
Why would you do that?

32:37.256 --> 32:39.089
She scares you, doesn't she?

32:39.091 --> 32:42.125
She scares you to death.

32:44.295 --> 32:46.797
You let me look around
for five minutes,

32:46.799 --> 32:49.900
and I won't tell Sister Horrible
about your nighttime forays.

32:51.302 --> 32:53.236
Or your secret tunnel.

33:11.089 --> 33:12.656
Hello, Mr. Walker.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.858
I'm Dr. Arthur Arden.

33:14.860 --> 33:16.193
I run this institution.

33:16.195 --> 33:18.261
I thought Sister Jude ran this place.

33:18.263 --> 33:19.296
So does she.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.607
Five minutes,
and then you leave.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.042
Scout's honor.

33:32.044 --> 33:33.443
Where are you keeping Bloody Face?

33:33.445 --> 33:35.078
Is he in here?

33:38.851 --> 33:41.451
<i>There was a time</i>

33:41.453 --> 33:42.953
<i>when a fanatic like Sister Jude</i>

33:42.955 --> 33:44.888
<i>could have had me thrown in prison</i>

33:44.890 --> 33:46.790
for my ideas, tortured.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.292
Maybe even castrated

33:49.294 --> 33:50.193
like Brother Abelard.

33:50.195 --> 33:53.230
These are not the Middle Ages,

33:53.232 --> 33:56.800
no matter how tightly
the good sister and her brood

33:56.802 --> 33:59.236
try to hold on to their fairy tale.

33:59.238 --> 34:00.904
No.

34:00.906 --> 34:02.339
This is my time now.

34:02.341 --> 34:04.474
The time of science.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.543
Miss, please.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.378
Not in here.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.545
This is the men's ward.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.348
What's this?

34:11.350 --> 34:13.150
Two little chicks,
looking for a place to roost?

34:13.152 --> 34:14.717
Back to bed, Mr. Spivey.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.186
You shouldn't be up.
Oh, I'm up.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.155
I made a mess, Sister.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.356
You want to see it?

34:22.592 --> 34:23.994
I'll be right back, miss.

34:23.996 --> 34:25.362
Please don't go anywhere.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.764
I got more for you, lady.

34:34.772 --> 34:37.706
I hope you don't mind
if I don't use anesthetic.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.576
It interferes with my readings.

34:44.882 --> 34:46.650
Hey, lady!

34:52.523 --> 34:54.123
You're not supposed to be in here.

34:54.126 --> 34:56.426
I guess you better report me then.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.428
Unless nobody saw anything.

35:02.433 --> 35:05.268
I'm sorry about your hair.

35:05.270 --> 35:06.603
Is this where they're keeping
the maniac?

35:06.605 --> 35:08.205
Which one?
Kit Walker.

35:08.207 --> 35:10.407
No, he misbehaved.
They took him to solitary.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.375
He'll have to play
with himself for a while.

35:12.377 --> 35:13.477
Solitary? Where's that?

35:25.723 --> 35:28.358
Alfred, get your hands
out of your pants.

35:50.249 --> 35:53.683
- Why are you doing this to me?
- The devil doesn't reside in hell, Mr. Walker.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.585
He lives right here

35:55.587 --> 35:57.320
in the frontal gyrus.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.189
The occipital lobes.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.291
Inside those beautiful brains

36:01.293 --> 36:03.426
lies the secret

36:03.428 --> 36:06.796
to understanding the darkness
of the human psyche.

36:06.798 --> 36:08.131
And ten of them

36:08.133 --> 36:09.766
put together

36:09.768 --> 36:11.368
are not as dark as what resides

36:11.370 --> 36:12.469
right here,

36:12.471 --> 36:13.837
in this cute,

36:13.839 --> 36:15.505
blonde melon.

36:27.318 --> 36:28.351
"Victim was found naked.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.820
"Preliminary findings indicate

36:30.822 --> 36:32.389
"that the skinning occurred

36:32.391 --> 36:33.523
"while the victim
was still breathing."

36:36.727 --> 36:37.494
Kit!

36:37.496 --> 36:40.630
Alma!

36:40.632 --> 36:41.698
Help me!

36:41.700 --> 36:43.366
Alma!

36:46.537 --> 36:47.971
You sliced her from the feet up.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.509
What did you do with the skin?

36:56.481 --> 36:58.315
I'm not here to pass judgment,
Mr. Walker.

36:58.317 --> 37:01.084
I'm merely interested in methodology.

37:01.086 --> 37:03.220
Hello. What's this?

37:03.222 --> 37:05.155
Way too hard to be a tumor.

37:46.197 --> 37:48.632
Mr. Walker?

37:48.634 --> 37:49.532
Mr. Walker?

37:57.475 --> 37:59.542
You've put everything at risk.

37:59.544 --> 38:01.111
Everything.

38:01.113 --> 38:02.379
Our reputation,

38:02.381 --> 38:03.446
the life's work

38:03.448 --> 38:04.781
of our great monsignor,

38:04.783 --> 38:06.416
all his future dreams.

38:06.418 --> 38:09.052
I used bad judgment, Sister.

38:09.054 --> 38:10.553
Bad judgment?

38:10.555 --> 38:11.721
Like eating too much cake?

38:11.723 --> 38:13.089
Is that what you mean, Sister?

38:13.091 --> 38:17.093
Miss Winters got me very confused.

38:17.095 --> 38:19.663
Maybe the sin is mine;
maybe my faith in you

38:19.665 --> 38:21.298
was nothing but the sin of pride.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.632
No, you're not a sinner, Sister.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.135
I favored you. I coddled you.

38:25.137 --> 38:27.671
I refused to see what others saw.

38:27.673 --> 38:28.838
When they said

38:28.840 --> 38:30.674
you were <i>stupid,</i>

38:30.676 --> 38:32.509
I said no, simply,

38:32.511 --> 38:34.444
you were more pure than the others.

38:34.446 --> 38:37.047
It's not big enough, Sister.

38:50.761 --> 38:52.662
Punish me, Sister, please.

38:53.497 --> 38:56.099
I'm so weak and stupid, Sister.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.467
Stupid dummy.

39:02.039 --> 39:03.873
Stand up and get out.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.175
I don't have time for this.

39:07.646 --> 39:08.645
Too good to me, Sister.

39:08.647 --> 39:10.680
If I ever hear you

39:10.682 --> 39:12.315
call yourself stupid again,

39:12.317 --> 39:13.683
I'll cane you bloody.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.643
You're awake.

39:40.645 --> 39:41.845
I'm so relieved.

39:41.847 --> 39:44.814
What's going on?

39:44.816 --> 39:46.549
You had an accident.

39:47.651 --> 39:49.552
Something attacked me.

39:49.554 --> 39:50.987
You writers,

39:50.989 --> 39:53.556
with your very fertile imagination.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.592
You took a tumble.

39:55.594 --> 39:56.860
Get me out of this thing.

39:56.862 --> 39:59.529
No, no. You mustn't move.

39:59.531 --> 40:02.365
You've got a long recovery
ahead of you.

40:02.367 --> 40:04.234
You can't keep me here.
No?

40:04.236 --> 40:06.669
There are people
who will come looking for me.

40:06.671 --> 40:08.538
Do you think so?

40:08.540 --> 40:09.439
You said she was hurt?

40:09.441 --> 40:11.708
While trespassing.

40:11.710 --> 40:16.212
You and Miss Winters have
a charming home here,

40:16.214 --> 40:18.615
Miss Paisa, very cozy.

40:18.617 --> 40:22.352
- I need to see her.
- But surely, you're not her family?

40:22.354 --> 40:25.288
Lana's parents don't
speak to her anymore.

40:25.290 --> 40:26.389
I-I'm practically family.

40:26.391 --> 40:28.525
We're very close.

40:28.527 --> 40:29.893
Are you now?
Like sisters.

40:29.895 --> 40:32.429
But point in fact,
you're not sisters,

40:32.431 --> 40:33.730
are you, Miss Paisa?

40:33.732 --> 40:34.864
I mean,

40:34.866 --> 40:36.366
you have no legal standing.

40:36.368 --> 40:38.435
I have a moral standing.

40:38.437 --> 40:41.171
Moral?
There's an interesting word.

40:45.910 --> 40:48.244
You're a... spinster,

40:48.246 --> 40:50.313
schoolteacher, I take it?
I teach the third grade.

40:50.315 --> 40:51.881
Oh, I admire that.

40:51.883 --> 40:54.751
The molding of young minds
is a sacred charge.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.252
You would never

40:56.254 --> 40:57.720
intentionally do anything to put

40:57.722 --> 40:59.222
these precious youngsters

40:59.224 --> 41:00.623
at risk?

41:00.625 --> 41:01.724
Of course not.

41:01.726 --> 41:03.993
So when you agreed to room
with Miss Winters,

41:03.995 --> 41:05.161
you couldn't possibly

41:05.163 --> 41:07.497
have been aware of her...

41:07.499 --> 41:08.898
inversion?

41:08.900 --> 41:11.401
Inversion?
I mean, you would never

41:11.403 --> 41:14.804
intentionally expose
these little angels

41:14.806 --> 41:17.073
to a homosexual, would you?

41:17.075 --> 41:19.642
We both know what

41:19.644 --> 41:22.846
that so-called monster
in the closet really is,

41:22.848 --> 41:25.081
don't we, Miss Winters?

41:25.083 --> 41:26.783
That's why you've come.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.785
Because something in you knew

41:28.787 --> 41:30.620
that you needed help.

41:30.622 --> 41:32.489
Are you threatening me, Sister?

41:32.491 --> 41:35.692
It is I who have
been threatened, young woman.

41:35.694 --> 41:37.827
Your friend gained access

41:37.829 --> 41:41.297
to my facility under false pretenses.

41:41.299 --> 41:42.499
She had no interest in our bakery.

41:42.501 --> 41:45.034
She wanted an inside look

41:45.036 --> 41:47.003
into a mental ward,

41:47.005 --> 41:49.005
and I intend to see that she gets it.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.107
You can't do this.
Oh, yes, I can.

41:51.109 --> 41:52.942
I can do it either

41:52.944 --> 41:54.711
by exposing the shenanigans

41:54.713 --> 41:57.614
that took place in this love nest,

41:57.616 --> 42:00.350
or I can do it discreetly.

42:00.352 --> 42:01.518
She will, of course,

42:01.520 --> 42:02.685
receive the finest

42:02.687 --> 42:05.188
of care.

42:05.190 --> 42:06.556
I have no legal standing.

42:06.558 --> 42:08.324
You are a respected member

42:08.326 --> 42:10.560
of this community, at least for now.

42:10.562 --> 42:14.731
Your sworn statement along
with our professional diagnosis

42:14.733 --> 42:17.200
is more than enough
for a friendly judge

42:17.202 --> 42:19.702
to remand Miss Winters
into my custody.

42:26.176 --> 42:28.211
It's a small town.

42:28.213 --> 42:31.814
A scandal will work just as well.

42:32.983 --> 42:35.485
You'll be ruined.

42:36.820 --> 42:39.022
You'll never step
into a classroom again.

42:39.024 --> 42:42.091
Wait! Wait!

42:55.373 --> 42:59.342
We're gonna slay that monster
together-- you and I.

42:59.344 --> 43:01.778
Morning devotionals
are at 6:00 a.m. sharp.

43:01.780 --> 43:02.879
No exceptions.

43:02.881 --> 43:06.049
No! Let me out of here!

43:06.051 --> 43:07.517
Come back here, you bitch!

43:07.519 --> 43:08.718
Chin up.

43:08.720 --> 43:11.688
We're gonna get you cured.

43:11.690 --> 43:12.889
Help me!

43:12.891 --> 43:14.757
Did you manage it?

43:14.759 --> 43:17.560
Yes, Sister Jude.

43:17.562 --> 43:19.529
Help me!
Though shalt not steal.

43:19.531 --> 43:21.631
Well, hopefully, that's
the only commandment

43:21.633 --> 43:24.601
you had to break
in order to get these.

43:24.603 --> 43:26.970
Come back here!

43:50.794 --> 43:52.829
Ah,

43:52.831 --> 43:54.130
Sister Jude.

43:54.132 --> 43:55.665
Come to lend a hand?

43:55.667 --> 43:56.833
What's going on in here?

43:56.835 --> 44:00.403
Just a little spring cleaning.

44:00.405 --> 44:02.739
That odor-- what is it?

44:02.741 --> 44:04.073
Disinfectant.

44:04.075 --> 44:05.775
Standard sanitary procedure.

44:05.777 --> 44:07.577
Cleanliness is, after all,

44:07.579 --> 44:08.911
next to godliness.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.582
Something's been living in here.

44:12.584 --> 44:14.917
That's absurd.

44:14.919 --> 44:17.086
This room has been
closed up for years.

44:17.088 --> 44:18.955
I'm in need
of some extra storage space.

44:18.957 --> 44:21.424
I think this will do quite nicely.

44:21.426 --> 44:23.526
Don't think you can pull one
over on me, Doctor.

44:23.528 --> 44:25.628
I'll ferret it out.

44:25.630 --> 44:28.031
Whatever it is you're up to.

44:28.033 --> 44:29.999
A ferret.

44:30.001 --> 44:32.301
Delightful creature.

44:32.303 --> 44:34.437
I used to keep one as a pet.

44:34.439 --> 44:36.539
Until it bit me,

44:36.541 --> 44:38.207
and I broke its neck.

44:39.777 --> 44:41.944
You brought me my keys?

44:41.946 --> 44:43.046
Thank you.

44:44.982 --> 44:48.618
You may think my mind
is closed, Doctor,

44:48.620 --> 44:51.521
but my eyes are wide open,
I promise you.

44:51.523 --> 44:53.923
You hear me?

46:00.009 --> 46:02.009
