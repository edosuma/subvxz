01:37.360 --> 01:39.840
Castlegard.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.600
Clear!

01:42.760 --> 01:44.720
- 250.
- 250 ready.

01:44.920 --> 01:46.120
Clear!

01:47.200 --> 01:48.520
- 300.
- 300 ready.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.080
Clear!

01:51.840 --> 01:53.000
He's gone.

01:53.200 --> 01:57.400
It's over 100 degrees out there.
He grabs me with ice-cold hands.

01:57.600 --> 02:00.840
Apart from external wounds,
everything is out of alignment.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.560
Even his veins are out of alignment.
Now, wait.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.720
Look at the heart.
The aorta doesn't line up.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.720
And now the spine.

02:08.919 --> 02:13.160
Same thing. Same shift
right across the third vertebrae.

02:13.360 --> 02:17.440
This guy looks like a paper doll
got cut up and pasted back together.

02:18.840 --> 02:22.360
No wallet. No ID.
Just this thing around his neck.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.120
It says ITC on it,
so we called them.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.400
- That outfit in the desert.
- Our biggest contributors.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.040
Excuse me, gentlemen.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.880
Frank Gordon, ITC.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.240
I'm here to pick up
Vince Taub's body.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.240
I'm Dr. Cova,
I'll take care of that paperwork.

02:38.440 --> 02:39.840
Thank you.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.240
Vincent Taub, huh?

02:44.520 --> 02:46.800
That's Vinnie's good-luck charm.
Thank you.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.560
Pretty sad when your time comes and
no one claims you but your employer.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.880
- Excuse me, sheriff.
- Sure.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.920
Gordon.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.600
I'm picking up the body
right now.

02:59.920 --> 03:03.400
- Was he alone or with Decker?
- Taub's the only one here.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.520
- Get the body out of there.
- And x-rays and records.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.200
Get everything, OK?
Will it be a problem?

03:09.400 --> 03:12.480
No, there's no problem.
They've been very accommodating.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.840
If this gets out, ITC is ruined.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.840
Any idea how he ended up
in the desert?

03:21.040 --> 03:24.960
I don't know. Maybe he used his
marker without enough clearance.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.960
- It could be a million things.
- Not too bright.

03:29.320 --> 03:30.680
He's dead, Robert.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.000
Taub is dead.

03:33.200 --> 03:36.160
Oh, Mr. Gordon, by the way,
what's Castlegard?

03:36.360 --> 03:39.160
I heard that's the only word
he said, "Castlegard".

03:41.920 --> 03:44.040
Sounds like an amusement park.

03:44.560 --> 03:48.480
Listen up, class, April 4, 1357,
Castlegard, France.

03:48.680 --> 03:53.120
The English army in their red uniforms
occupied the village of Castlegard.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.840
The French, meanwhile,
were advancing.

03:56.040 --> 04:00.040
trying to drive them out of there,
in this direction over the river,

04:00.240 --> 04:05.520
past the monastery and up
and over to the heights here.

04:06.960 --> 04:10.360
Just leave it, Chris, that's fine,
before you wreck the place.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.560
The English army, meanwhile,
had retreated to Castle La Roque.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.560
Well fortified, very strong,
very well supplied,

04:17.760 --> 04:20.880
and both sides had settled in
for a long siege.

04:21.079 --> 04:24.200
The French were trying to push
the English out of France.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.280
Lord Oliver tries to take the fight
out of the French.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.160
Now, he has a prisoner, a woman.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.400
A woman of class
and a woman of nobility.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.000
Commander Arnaut's sister,
Lady Claire.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.560
He hangs her from the battlements
for all of the French forces to see.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.240
Instead of demoralizing the French,
it whips them into a frenzy,

04:43.400 --> 04:45.640
and they attack the castle
like madmen,

04:45.800 --> 04:49.960
and they overpower the English
with sheer passion.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.840
So the fortress of La Roque
fell in one night

04:53.040 --> 04:56.520
because of the death of one woman.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.320
Lady Claire.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.280
All right, that's enough
of the academics for today.

05:02.480 --> 05:03.840
Go get your hands dirty.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.240
Hi, Chris.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.440
Hey, Dad, I got Marek's clippers.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.760
Oh, Chris, great. Thanks.
Here, hold that, will you.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.120
You can move it around if you like.

05:17.320 --> 05:20.440
- I thought this would be a routine trip.
- It is.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.440
Last time you cut off your beard,
you sold the house

05:23.640 --> 05:25.600
and we moved to Kentucky
for a year.

05:25.800 --> 05:29.200
- Your mother wanted a change.
- How does this always happen to me?

05:29.400 --> 05:32.680
I am older and very much wiser
than you, Have a beer.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.360
It'll cool you down.
Very hot work, ironing.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.120
I know something's going on.

05:37.320 --> 05:40.120
The beard's coming off,
so what's really happening?

05:42.560 --> 05:45.520
It's these amazing finds
we've been making.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.960
Doniger's been giving us
too many tips.

05:48.440 --> 05:51.440
- He's a lucky zillionaire.
- Nobody's that lucky.

05:51.640 --> 05:55.960
He knows something he's not saying.
Something isn't right about this.

05:56.360 --> 05:59.080
He's been ducking me.
I'm gonna get a few answers.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.120
Maybe scrounge a couple of bucks.

06:01.320 --> 06:04.280
Put that in my bag, would you?
And don't wrinkle it.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.160
I'd appreciate it
if you don't tell anybody about this.

06:08.360 --> 06:09.880
Especially Kate.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.520
- Why would I tell Kate?
- Here.

06:12.720 --> 06:16.520
Have a wee run round that,
would you? "Why would I tell Kate?"

06:16.720 --> 06:20.440
You see me twice a year,
stay until you're bored to distraction.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.520
I think the record's three weeks.

06:22.720 --> 06:25.560
Maybe I'm just really beginning
to enjoy archeology.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.920
From a boy who hated Easter
because he had to find eggs.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.840
- Yeah, because you buried the eggs.
- That's beside the point.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.840
- Yeah, because you buried the eggs.
- That's beside the point.

06:33.040 --> 06:36.120
You're still here because of Kate.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.960
Chris.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.880
Look, son,

06:40.520 --> 06:43.080
I love you,
but you're scorching my shirt.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.480
Sorry.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.600
You and Kate
are from different worlds.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.600
You saw how that turned out
between your mother and me.

06:49.800 --> 06:53.520
Yeah, but, Dad, no offense,
I'm not like you.

06:54.240 --> 06:55.560
But Kate is.

06:56.440 --> 07:00.520
Trust me, if it's between
archeology and you,

07:01.800 --> 07:03.560
you'll lose.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.600
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.200
I brought you a beer.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.800
- That's so sweet.
- Half a beer anyways.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.360
Half a beer.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.880
- What you got going on here?
- The stairs.

07:26.080 --> 07:28.800
The ones you were talking about?
Where do they go?

07:29.000 --> 07:32.240
Now they don't go anywhere,
but they'll lead me to my tunnel

07:32.440 --> 07:34.520
which will go
all the way to La Roque.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.600
What do you say I help you out?
Show me what to do.

07:37.800 --> 07:41.440
- I thought you hated this stuff.
- No, I don't hate it.

07:41.640 --> 07:44.280
Let's have a beer, I need a break.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.200
- You have the full one.
- That's sweet of you.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.560
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.760
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.560
Think you'll follow
in your father's footsteps?

07:56.760 --> 07:58.920
- No.
- No.

07:59.120 --> 08:03.880
No way. Actually, I'm not really
all that interested in the past.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.600
No? What are you interested in then?

08:15.560 --> 08:18.320
I think I already know
the answer to that question.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.960
I've been hoping that you'd notice.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.680
I've been hoping you'd quit hoping
I'd notice.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.280
So there's nothing there?

08:30.600 --> 08:33.440
- Chris, you are the boss' son.
- So...

08:33.640 --> 08:35.480
there is something there.

08:36.559 --> 08:40.919
It's late, I'll just start on this tomorrow.
But thanks for the beer.

09:04.520 --> 09:08.400
- Haven't been practicing, have you?
- I'm not getting any younger.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.800
- You love this stuff.
- It's a habit I can't quite kick.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.760
Let me take that from you before
you cut something you'll need later.

09:15.960 --> 09:19.240
So talking about love.

09:19.640 --> 09:23.040
- how did it go last night?
- It didn't.

09:23.240 --> 09:27.240
So how does it feel being passed over
for 600-year-old ruins?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.960
It sucks.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.120
It sucks big time.

09:32.360 --> 09:35.040
I don't understand you guys.
You live in the past.

09:35.240 --> 09:39.400
You know what the past is to me?
The past is why my parents split up.

09:39.600 --> 09:42.720
The past is what I've been force-fed
since I was little.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.960
None of you archeologists
looks to the future.

09:45.160 --> 09:49.440
What are you talking about? What is
the future but just more of the same?

09:49.640 --> 09:53.160
More gadgets, more machines
like that thing you rode up on.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.360
It's the past is where it's at,
you know.

09:57.240 --> 10:00.320
People then,
they cared about each other.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.440
- Men had honor, you know?
- No, no.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.520
You know what that is to me?
Romantic warrior crap.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.360
Romantic?

10:07.720 --> 10:10.080
You want to see romantic?
Follow me.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.600
Come on.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.360
Come on!

10:14.320 --> 10:16.280
What have you got?

10:16.480 --> 10:19.840
Oh, another stone
sticking out of the ground.

10:20.040 --> 10:25.520
No, it's a 600-year-old sarcophagus
with a French knight and his lady.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.880
- Look, isn't she beautiful?
- She's a real knockout.

10:29.080 --> 10:32.520
Very funny. Another thing,
down here, they're holding hands.

10:32.720 --> 10:36.760
- Incredibly unusual for that period.
- That is kind of unusual, huh?

10:37.160 --> 10:40.280
Oh, God, over here.
This knight has only got one ear.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.800
What happened there?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.360
What, one ear?
That piece is missing.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.360
It's somewhere here in the dirt.

10:48.560 --> 10:51.080
I'm the archeologist.
It was carved that way.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.080
- Fair enough.
- Trust me.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.560
Who do you think they were?

10:55.760 --> 10:59.440
Why would somebody that doesn't
give a shit be concerned with that?

11:02.080 --> 11:04.440
- Because I'm intrigued, all right?
- See?

11:04.640 --> 11:06.600
- What you wanted to hear?
- Yeah.

11:06.800 --> 11:10.160
We're all intrigued by this.
That's why we're all here.

11:10.360 --> 11:14.240
It's not just about the rocks
and the rubble.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.840
It's about these people.

11:16.640 --> 11:19.800
Who were they?
And what were their stories?

11:20.120 --> 11:24.840
It helps us to understand where we
came from, or where we're going.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.400
- You know what I like to say.
- "You make your own history."

11:29.320 --> 11:31.840
- Do I say it that often?
- Yeah, all the time.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.840
Well, whoever they were,

11:36.200 --> 11:37.960
they made theirs

11:38.120 --> 11:39.840
together.

11:44.680 --> 11:48.640
It's best to go really, really slow.
It's better to be cautious.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.920
Come on. Hurry up!

11:55.680 --> 11:58.960
Cave-in at the monastery!
Cave-in at the monastery!

12:00.320 --> 12:03.240
I was standing and the floor gave way
underneath my feet.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.680
- How long has it been open?
- 15 minutes.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.680
We have five minutes
before oxygen contamination.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.400
- Let's move it.
- Be careful.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.800
- It's under where I was working.
- I don't know about this.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.120
Can everybody listen up?
Let's be careful, we got that?

12:17.880 --> 12:19.560
I've got your back. Be safe.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.840
- Who's going in first?
- OK, let's go.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.800
- Who's going down first?
- I am.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.080
- On belay! On Kate!
- OK, take me down nice and slow.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.120
- Give me a radio check.
- Please be careful.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.960
- OK, one-two. Do you read me?
- We're good.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.360
That's good.
Just keep it steady.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.520
- Lower Kate down.
- Lower me down.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.040
Easy, guys.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.400
Nice and slow.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.400
Nice and slow.
I'm getting close to the first level.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.600
- Easy!
- Bring me down, guys.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.400
- A little more on Marek.
- Smell the stale air.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.280
Kate, be careful down there.

12:52.080 --> 12:55.560
I'm down. Oh, my God. This is
right below where I was working.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.080
Are you all right?
What's going on?

12:57.280 --> 13:00.040
"All right?" "All right" is not the word.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.200
- One...
- Give me slack on the rope.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.960
- More slack!
- Come on, guys.

13:07.360 --> 13:11.040
- Oh, my God.
- This is unbelievable.

13:11.680 --> 13:14.800
We are the first people in this room
for 600 years.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.560
These...

13:17.800 --> 13:19.480
These...

13:20.200 --> 13:22.040
...are beautiful.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.000
You won't believe the condition
of these...

13:30.200 --> 13:32.320
- What have you got?
- Come here.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.240
No way. This is too much.
Oh, my God.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.920
- What is it?
- Oh, my God.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.560
An old document box.

13:38.760 --> 13:41.120
We've got an oilskin
with documents inside.

13:41.320 --> 13:45.200
- Look at the condition of this thing!
- OK, let's be really careful.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.800
Quick, get the bag.

13:48.400 --> 13:52.040
- I can't believe this.
- That is gonna be such a find.

13:52.200 --> 13:54.120
Careful, careful, careful.

13:56.840 --> 13:59.720
Let's get this up.
I need the light for a minute.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.520
Oh, my God.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.480
Oh, my God.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.800
- Oh, man!
- Give me the light.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.760
- What kind of...
- It's amazing.

14:14.920 --> 14:20.680
...son of a bitch would deliberately
damage something so beautiful?

14:21.360 --> 14:23.440
Obviously not an archeologist.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.280
We've gotta get out of here.
Let's go!

14:28.480 --> 14:29.640
Guys, we're coming up!

14:29.960 --> 14:31.160
Pull it up! Come on!

14:31.520 --> 14:33.680
We want to go up quick, OK?

14:33.880 --> 14:36.120
- Hold this.
- What are you doing, Marek?

14:36.320 --> 14:38.720
- It's OK.
- What are you doing?

14:39.440 --> 14:42.040
It's definitely a modern-day
bifocal lens.

14:42.240 --> 14:46.080
I know. And bifocals weren't invented
until the mid-1 700s.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.360
The hole only opened up
today, Stern.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.800
There's been nobody down
that chamber before Kate and I.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.520
If you think that's weird,
you'll love this.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.840
- What is this?
- One of the documents you found.

14:58.040 --> 15:02.360
It's just a simple list of the things
stored in there. Nothing special.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.760
And then we found this. Look.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.520
The professor?

15:12.240 --> 15:15.160
"Help me"?
"E.A. Johnston"?

15:15.360 --> 15:18.000
- "4/2/1357"?
- 1357.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.360
- E.A. Johnston.
- What is going on?

15:20.560 --> 15:24.040
I cross-matched the signatures.
It's definitely his handwriting.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.760
But he's only been gone for two days.

15:26.960 --> 15:30.720
Your father wrote that,
but he wrote it 600 years ago.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.080
What's going on here?

15:32.280 --> 15:36.040
François is looking for his spare pair.
I'll see if the prescriptions match.

15:36.240 --> 15:40.160
So you're telling me this is the
professor's and it's 600 years old?

15:40.360 --> 15:43.080
- What have you been smoking?
- Maybe you can explain.

15:43.280 --> 15:47.240
If I knew, I'd explain it. All I know
is that the ink is 600 years old.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.520
I know. This is my father.
This is him.

15:49.720 --> 15:52.880
- He's just playing a prank.
- No! No, there is no way

15:53.080 --> 15:56.720
he would risk contaminating the site
as a joke. He just wouldn't.

15:56.920 --> 15:59.600
- Did you carbon-date the ink?
- Of course.

15:59.800 --> 16:03.080
- There's got to be another reason.
- I did it three times.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.480
Like I just said,

16:07.720 --> 16:09.880
your father wrote that note,

16:10.120 --> 16:12.560
but he wrote it 600 years ago.

16:19.480 --> 16:23.440
I don't care about ITC's policies,
I'm his son. I wanna talk to him now.

16:23.640 --> 16:26.960
I found the professor's glasses.
They were on his desk.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.640
It's a perfect match, Look.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.560
We should do an optical test
to make sure.

16:32.760 --> 16:36.520
I'm sick of this. Either somebody
tell me where Professor Johnston is

16:36.720 --> 16:39.080
or I report a kidnapping
to the authorities.

16:39.280 --> 16:41.240
Have I made myself clear?

16:43.120 --> 16:45.040
Just tell us when and where.

16:45.240 --> 16:46.640
What is it?

16:47.080 --> 16:49.320
Doniger's sending a plane for us.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.640
We're going to New Mexico?

16:52.040 --> 16:54.040
Let's pack up, guys.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.440
Good morning.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.400
Steven Kramer, ITC.
Frank Gordon, security.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.000
- Where's my dad?
- You'll see your dad shortly.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.839
- Where's Doniger at?
- Doniger's waiting inside.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.599
- Mr. Kramer will explain everything.
- Tell me.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.440
How come we have
a 600-year-old document

17:12.640 --> 17:15.440
- with his handwriting?
- Pleading for help.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.520
I'll explain as soon
as we get through security.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.440
ITC is constantly advancing itself
in science.

17:21.640 --> 17:25.240
30 years ago, the business world
was revolutionized with a machine

17:25.440 --> 17:28.520
that sent documents anywhere
with the push of a button.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.480
Doniger's vision was to do that
with 3-D objects.

17:31.680 --> 17:34.440
- Like a fax or something?
- Exactly.

17:34.640 --> 17:38.200
He's trying to send actual objects
from one place to another?

17:38.400 --> 17:40.320
- Follow me.
- But that's impossible.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.880
He would need a quantum computer
with millions of processors.

17:44.080 --> 17:48.080
We used them to build a machine that
could fax three-dimensional objects.

17:48.280 --> 17:53.080
I'll explain these mirrors later. It would
put FedEx and UPS out of business.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.560
- You actually made it work?
- Yes.

17:55.720 --> 17:56.920
Across a room.

17:57.120 --> 17:59.960
But we wanted to send things
across continents

18:00.160 --> 18:03.080
so we built a bigger machine.
This is the prototype.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.560
The prototype?
So that thing that we just passed...

18:06.760 --> 18:08.680
- Exactly.
- ...is the real thing?

18:08.880 --> 18:11.080
We gave it a thousand times
more power.

18:11.240 --> 18:13.680
We tried to send something
from New Mexico

18:13.880 --> 18:16.760
to a twin machine at a lab
in New York City.

18:17.240 --> 18:19.160
Now, here's the interesting part.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.360
The package never arrived
at its destination.

18:22.920 --> 18:25.400
A few hours later,
it showed up back here.

18:25.800 --> 18:30.120
Wait a minute. So if it went missing
between New Mexico and New York,

18:30.320 --> 18:33.960
- where did it go in the meantime?
- We asked the same question.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.240
So we sent out a camera
over and over,

18:36.440 --> 18:40.800
and we got back photos of the
same location, a hillside with trees.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.240
That's when Mr. Doniger
made the brilliant decision

18:44.440 --> 18:46.720
to point the camera straight up.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.960
So once we cross-referenced
star charts to the horizon,

18:50.120 --> 18:54.080
we realized that the camera
was not only in the wrong place,

18:54.280 --> 18:58.080
- but it was in the wrong time.
- So, what does that mean?

18:58.360 --> 19:00.840
The camera was taking photographs
of a wilderness

19:01.040 --> 19:04.160
near Castlegard, France
in the year 1357.

19:04.360 --> 19:07.560
So you're saying you accidentally
discovered time travel?

19:07.760 --> 19:10.240
No, we accidentally discovered
a wormhole.

19:10.440 --> 19:15.040
A wormhole that seems to be locked
to a single time and place in the past:

19:15.240 --> 19:17.880
1357, Castlegard.

19:18.680 --> 19:23.000
So you faxed my father's glasses and
documents back to the 1 4th century?

19:23.200 --> 19:24.920
No, Chris.

19:26.120 --> 19:30.280
Your father is in the 1 4th century.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.640
What?

19:31.840 --> 19:35.080
- We need you to help get him back.
- Mr. Robert Doniger,

19:35.280 --> 19:36.560
this doesn't make sense.

19:36.760 --> 19:40.960
A wormhole is a volatile force.
You can't send a person through one.

19:41.160 --> 19:43.760
Can't fit a piece of paper
through a telephone wire.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.120
But you can send a fax.

19:45.320 --> 19:49.200
Sure, once you've broken the message
into a stream of electrons, but...

19:50.160 --> 19:51.840
- Oh, shit.
- Now, look.

19:52.040 --> 19:54.480
I don't care
about the hows or the whys.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.440
I care about my father.
Did he know about all this?

19:57.640 --> 19:59.280
I thought we could help each other.
We'd give him hints

19:59.280 --> 20:00.600
I thought we could help each other.
We'd give him hints

20:00.800 --> 20:03.680
about the best excavation areas,
and he could discover

20:03.880 --> 20:06.840
why we're locked
into this particular place and time.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.080
So this is why you've been
funding our dig.

20:10.960 --> 20:14.280
He was more astute than I thought.
We gave him too many clues

20:14.480 --> 20:17.160
and he became very, very suspicious.

20:17.320 --> 20:20.120
How could you send him there?
God knows where he is...

20:20.320 --> 20:23.880
Oh, he's a very persuasive man.
He insisted on going.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.760
- Now he's stuck.
- That's where you all come in.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.880
Do we look like
wormhole specialists?

20:29.080 --> 20:31.880
You sent the professor
to the Hundred Years' War?

20:32.080 --> 20:34.520
- Right.
- Turbulent times you sent him to.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.080
We need cultural experts,
not scientists.

20:37.280 --> 20:39.560
My people don't know
about the medieval world

20:39.720 --> 20:42.280
or how to mingle,
which is what we have to do

20:42.480 --> 20:45.400
if we are to find the professor
and bring him back.

20:45.600 --> 20:48.080
So we bring him back,
it's that simple.

20:48.280 --> 20:52.840
We step on that machine and whiz
back to 1357 to get him back?

20:53.040 --> 20:55.880
Once he's broken us
into a stream of electrons.

20:56.040 --> 21:00.160
- Why should we do what you ask us?
- I think we need to know more...

21:00.360 --> 21:03.720
- I know you have a lot of questions...
- A lot of questions.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.680
The professor's already been gone
for 72 hours

21:06.880 --> 21:10.400
and every minute he's there,
it'll be more difficult to find him.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.160
- That's true.
- Bob?

21:12.360 --> 21:15.680
Excuse me, I need to get them
changed if they're going to go.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.600
- Frank, change with them.
- I'm not going.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.680
- Gomez and Baretto are ready.
- We need to think...

21:21.880 --> 21:24.920
- I'd like you along.
- We didn't say we were going.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.720
Steve, can you bring them
to prep, please.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.000
Sure. Folks, this way.

21:31.080 --> 21:33.360
Thank you. Please, this way.
Thank you.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.520
Just follow Steve.
He'll take you to the prep room.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.440
Bob, look. Gomez and Baretto
are my two best men.

21:41.640 --> 21:44.840
They can handle any situation.
I would prefer not going.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.760
I really want you to go.

21:47.960 --> 21:50.120
And if you see Decker,
you know what to do.

21:50.280 --> 21:51.760
Robert...

21:59.240 --> 22:02.280
You know, that was a really
great speech you made.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.240
I almost believed it myself.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.520
- Didn't you forget something?
- What?

22:06.720 --> 22:10.840
Come on. Look at Taub's MRIs.
Look at his arteries.

22:11.040 --> 22:14.000
This was his tenth trip.
This is their first and only.

22:14.240 --> 22:17.760
They deserve to know that we don't
know how he ended up in the desert.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.200
You don't think they deserve
to know that?

22:20.360 --> 22:21.840
I've told them enough.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.040
How did my father get stuck
back there?

22:27.240 --> 22:28.960
Doniger gave him an hour.

22:29.160 --> 22:32.120
Things got harried,
and I lost him in the woods.

22:32.320 --> 22:34.640
- You left him there.
- We have a limited time.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.920
I had to come back
or we'd both be stuck.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.560
I guess it's better him
than you, right?

22:40.840 --> 22:44.320
Listen, there's a few things
we have to go over before we leave.

22:44.520 --> 22:47.560
They need your vital data.
It's for your return process.

22:47.760 --> 22:51.000
Change from your clothes
into those clothes over there.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.200
Anything you want.
Put your personals in the lockers.

22:54.400 --> 22:57.920
I want to introduce you to two friends.
Bill Baretto, Jimmy Gomez.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.840
They're coming with us.
Buddies from the Marines.

23:01.040 --> 23:04.800
- Why do we need Marines?
- Just in case something goes wrong.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.480
I like to have all my bases covered.
All right, let's change up.

23:08.680 --> 23:12.960
I can't believe you're considering this.
Do you understand what it does?

23:13.160 --> 23:15.600
It strips you down
to a molecular level.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.280
which means, for a moment,
you cease to exist.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.760
- Listen to him, he's got a point.
- Hold on! Wait a second.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.360
I don't need you, Miss Ericson.
Or Chris.

23:24.560 --> 23:27.880
- I need you. You know the layout.
- Nobody knows it like I do.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.160
- I go.
- There's no way I'm not going.

23:30.360 --> 23:33.760
I just said I'm not going,
so don't touch me!

23:33.960 --> 23:35.400
Thanks.

23:36.160 --> 23:39.400
Stern, we don't need you back there.
You're a physicist.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.000
- Your knowledge won't help us.
- I'm sorry.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.640
But we are going to need you,
François.

23:45.960 --> 23:49.720
- Why do we need him?
- Because he speaks French fluently.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.120
- He's right.
- My high-school French sucks.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.240
- Don't do this.
- We need his help.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.480
- I'll cover you.
- Don't pressure him.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.120
François, you have to make
your own decision on this.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.640
Your father would've done it for me,
so, yes, I'll come.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.840
- OK.
- Yes.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.400
Thank you.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.600
Thank you.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.280
- Magnetic coils ready.
- Verifying now.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.640
Platform up.

24:17.840 --> 24:20.080
Computers are up, Mr. Doniger.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.320
Tell Gordon we've got to get going.

24:23.720 --> 24:26.560
Keep a couple of beers
cold for me, all right?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.080
Mr. Stern.

24:29.280 --> 24:31.440
Watch our backs, OK?

24:31.640 --> 24:34.600
It will be all right.
We'll be back before you know it.

24:34.920 --> 24:37.880
- Take it easy, bro.
- You know the 50 bucks I owe you?

24:38.080 --> 24:39.680
All right, let's move it.

24:39.880 --> 24:42.480
Frank, six hours
and the clock is running.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.960
Wear these personal markers
around your neck.

24:45.160 --> 24:48.000
You can use any one of them
to call for your return.

24:48.200 --> 24:51.360
Frank will explain their intricacies
once you arrive.

24:51.560 --> 24:55.240
Most importantly, one marker
will bring all of you back.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.600
- Do not lose them.
- What about weapons?

24:57.800 --> 25:00.200
Nothing modern goes back.
Especially weapons.

25:00.400 --> 25:03.240
- They're set for a six-hour countdown.
- Countdown?

25:03.440 --> 25:06.760
- They burn out after six hours.
- And then?

25:06.960 --> 25:09.440
I'll get you back before you know it.

25:09.640 --> 25:10.840
Oh.

25:11.560 --> 25:14.400
Sorry, François,
they didn't have these back then.

25:14.600 --> 25:15.760
I don't see without...

25:15.960 --> 25:19.040
You'll be fine. That's where
we goofed with the professor.

25:19.240 --> 25:23.720
I feel morally compelled to inform you
that there is a degree of pain.

25:23.920 --> 25:27.240
I'm told it's rather intense,
but extremely fleeting.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.800
A couple of seconds.
No residual discomfort.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.600
So forgive me. I didn't want that
to influence your decision.

25:34.720 --> 25:37.880
- OK. Good luck.
- Let's do it.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.160
You all look great.
Miss Ericson, you look divine.

25:41.320 --> 25:42.520
Good luck.

25:42.960 --> 25:46.240
Don't worry about it.
You guys will be home for lunch.

25:46.440 --> 25:51.360
- Think of it as the ultimate field trip.
- A fantastic thing for an archeologist.

25:51.560 --> 25:55.280
- I can't believe we're doing this.
- Slowly. There are no railings.

25:55.480 --> 25:56.080
Josh, come on down. Come watch.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.760
Josh, come on down. Come watch.

25:57.960 --> 26:00.840
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Take a place around the perimeter.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.400
- Spread out.
- Move around the platform.

26:03.600 --> 26:07.160
Take a deep breath, relax.
We'll be back before you know it.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.320
- Are we set?
- All systems check.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.560
Come in, Josh. Close the door.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.840
- Good luck.
- Six hours and counting.

26:16.040 --> 26:20.240
Mr. Marek? Mr. Marek.
I need you to take your position.

26:20.440 --> 26:21.920
How's everybody doing?

26:22.120 --> 26:25.320
- What the hell are we doing?
- Getting the chance of a lifetime.

26:26.760 --> 26:29.400
Nothing to worry about.
We'll take care of you.

26:29.600 --> 26:32.280
Just relax. Everything will be fine.

26:34.520 --> 26:37.240
- DNA streams locked in.
- Thank you.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.680
- OK, lock them in.
- Locking in.

26:56.680 --> 26:59.240
- How long does it take?
- A couple of seconds.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.640
Watch it here.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.880
Mirrors locked.

27:23.720 --> 27:24.920
Son of a...

27:45.480 --> 27:47.120
Where is he? François!

27:48.720 --> 27:52.520
- Are you all right?
- Where's François? François?

27:52.680 --> 27:54.400
- There he is!
- François!

27:54.760 --> 27:56.160
Pull him out!

28:00.560 --> 28:02.440
Now we wait.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.080
Give me your hand!

28:10.560 --> 28:13.440
- Come on!
- François, hold on! Hold on!

28:13.640 --> 28:15.520
Hold on!

28:16.360 --> 28:18.720
- Here, take my hand.
- You all right?

28:18.960 --> 28:20.840
You all right?
Everybody all right?

28:21.720 --> 28:23.680
That was a close one.
All right.

28:23.880 --> 28:26.520
Let's head up this hill.
Everybody follow me up.

28:28.880 --> 28:31.440
- Hell of a start.
- We've always arrived on land.

28:31.720 --> 28:33.760
- Gordon, is this it?
- I think so.

28:33.960 --> 28:36.160
You think so?
Are we in 1357 France?

28:36.360 --> 28:38.880
- This could be Oregon.
- Gordon, where are we?

28:39.080 --> 28:42.040
Shut up!
Trust me, we're in 1357 France.

28:42.240 --> 28:45.760
- Well, if this is France. I'm home.
- Come on, let's go.

28:46.840 --> 28:50.640
Let me explain the markers. Press
here, it shows the remaining time.

28:50.840 --> 28:52.680
Squeeze it, it takes you home.
But don't.

28:52.840 --> 28:54.640
- Why?
- We haven't found his dad yet.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.280
One last thing...

28:57.840 --> 29:00.920
- He said, "Hide". Everyone hide.
- All right, take cover.

29:01.120 --> 29:03.120
Let's go! Move! Now!

29:04.120 --> 29:05.880
François, come on!

29:23.760 --> 29:25.760
Well done, Sir De Kere.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.320
- After him.
- Yes, my lord.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.720
Get the others.
Find out who they are.

29:38.440 --> 29:39.640
Come on, quick.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.200
Oh, God! Baretto!

30:00.280 --> 30:02.520
We got a field buck!
They're coming back!

30:05.760 --> 30:07.560
- Oh, my God.
- Get a medic!

30:07.720 --> 30:09.240
Get a medic up here!

30:09.800 --> 30:12.160
- What was that? What was that?
- What?

30:12.560 --> 30:13.760
What is that?

30:13.960 --> 30:15.520
That's a grenade! Get down!

30:26.600 --> 30:27.800
Oh, my God, he's left.

30:29.960 --> 30:31.600
Get down! He'll see you!

30:35.760 --> 30:37.760
You! Over here!

30:52.520 --> 30:54.480
Let's go. Come on, come on!

30:56.520 --> 30:58.040
All right, let's go.

31:02.120 --> 31:03.920
Come on, Chris!

31:04.520 --> 31:05.760
Kate!

31:05.960 --> 31:07.720
Marek! Hey.

31:07.880 --> 31:11.480
- Where's my boys? Where's Marek?
- The guys came after Baretto.

31:11.680 --> 31:15.920
He took some arrows and then
he pressed his marker. He's gone.

31:16.120 --> 31:19.000
He took two arrows,
and he must have hit his marker.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.840
- Where's Gomez?
- I didn't see him.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.320
Oh, my God.

31:25.480 --> 31:26.960
Don't look.

31:27.880 --> 31:31.040
- What are you doing?
- Oh, shit, I can't find his marker.

31:31.240 --> 31:33.720
You're looking for his marker?
He's dead!

31:33.920 --> 31:36.840
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting us out of here.

31:37.040 --> 31:40.440
- We're not going anywhere.
- We can't save anyone if we're dead!

31:40.640 --> 31:42.720
- Keep it quiet.
- You can't do that.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.360
Why not?!

31:44.560 --> 31:47.680
You need 40 feet of clearance
around all sides to work.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.720
- What?
- I was trying to tell you.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.800
Don't lose these. They're precious.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.520
And if you follow my lead, I will
get your dad and get you home.

31:55.720 --> 31:58.440
- François, it's going to be OK.
- Let's find Marek.

31:58.600 --> 32:01.640
- What about Gomez?
- We can't do anything about him now.

32:01.840 --> 32:05.680
- We gotta go. Look at me.
- François, come on.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.800
Be quiet! The soldiers!

32:31.000 --> 32:34.880
You passed us. You passed us
in the woods. It's OK. It's OK.

32:39.880 --> 32:43.040
- We've lost the trail.
- Damn it.

32:43.240 --> 32:45.160
- Pick it up again.
- Yes, Sir De Kere.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.560
Search down by the river.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.880
Jesus, you're a girl.

32:54.120 --> 32:55.840
It's OK.

33:17.280 --> 33:19.320
After the French bastards!

33:35.240 --> 33:38.200
After them! Leave none living!

33:41.640 --> 33:43.160
Careful.

33:44.280 --> 33:47.280
- There you are.
- No.

33:54.920 --> 33:57.800
Help! Help!

34:25.120 --> 34:26.920
Shut it off!

34:27.120 --> 34:28.880
He knew not to take
anything modern.

34:29.080 --> 34:31.960
That son of a bitch brought
a grenade back with him.

34:32.159 --> 34:33.719
I can't believe it.

34:33.920 --> 34:36.239
The coils. The coils.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.840
Damn it! He knew the regulations,
no modern weapons!

34:40.600 --> 34:44.000
- Gomez?
- The lines are online!

34:44.239 --> 34:47.800
- Well...
- His marker.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.280
- What happened to the rest of them?
- Get a medic over here!

34:52.480 --> 34:54.360
- I don't know.
- Give me your gloves.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.840
Well, did anyone try
to come back with him?

34:57.000 --> 34:59.800
I don't know. I know as much
as you, OK? Hang on.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.080
What if they're trying
to come back now?

35:02.280 --> 35:05.040
- It's not gonna happen...
- Don't jump to conclusions.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.800
You can't leave seven people
stuck back there!

35:08.000 --> 35:10.440
- Tell me you have a backup plan...
- Shut up!

35:10.640 --> 35:13.400
I don't know. I don't know.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.680
Please tell me you
have a backup plan.

35:20.920 --> 35:23.720
Yes, we have a backup plan.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.120
Go!

35:42.160 --> 35:45.440
Gordon! Gordon! It's Marek! Chris!

35:45.640 --> 35:47.840
This Frenchwoman
will lead us to Castlegard.

35:48.040 --> 35:51.480
Great. That's great.
Let's go. Come on.

36:08.600 --> 36:14.280
Wow. The village of Castlegard.
We're here.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.160
Where is everyone going?

36:20.440 --> 36:22.000
Hold on a second.

36:22.200 --> 36:25.520
- What day is this?
- Marek...

36:26.000 --> 36:27.880
It's the fourth of April.

36:28.080 --> 36:31.520
- Of course it is. It's April 4th.
- 1357.

36:32.280 --> 36:34.240
- The day La Roque falls?
- Wait, wait.

36:34.440 --> 36:37.080
- What are you talking about?
- You son of a bitch,

36:37.280 --> 36:39.080
- Excuse me?
- You brought us back

36:39.280 --> 36:41.160
on the day the French attack.

36:41.360 --> 36:44.520
By tonight, this whole place
is gonna be burned to the ground.

36:44.680 --> 36:47.360
Stop with the history
and look for the professor.

36:47.720 --> 36:48.960
Now, follow me.

36:50.640 --> 36:51.920
Let's go.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.480
I'm a physicist. Give me
something to do. I can help.

37:00.680 --> 37:03.400
- Might as well be a pharmacist.
- Good one, Robert.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.720
- Replacement panels are on their way.
- How long will this take?

37:06.920 --> 37:09.120
Five hours and 27 minutes.

37:09.320 --> 37:12.320
How do you know it's gonna
take 5 hours and 27 minutes?

37:12.520 --> 37:15.120
Because that's all the time we have.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.600
Once this platform is fixed,

37:19.800 --> 37:23.920
even if the markers run out, we can
send someone back to get them?

37:24.440 --> 37:27.240
The thing holding the wormhole open
is their markers.

37:27.520 --> 37:30.120
But you've opened and closed
it dozens of times.

37:30.320 --> 37:32.880
- Once the platform...
- Look, we don't even know

37:33.080 --> 37:35.400
what we did to link us
to this wormhole.

37:35.600 --> 37:39.520
A lucky calibration, chance impurity
in the coils. The point is, the grenade

37:39.720 --> 37:42.320
probably destroyed any possibility
of re-creating it.

37:42.520 --> 37:45.640
Once their markers expire,
they could be stuck there forever?

37:45.800 --> 37:48.120
- Is that what you're saying?
- They could be.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.880
Guys, come on. Come on, come on.

38:11.560 --> 38:14.960
Come on. Come on.
Come on, this way.

38:16.320 --> 38:18.760
Castle La Roque awaits its soldiers.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.360
- The manor house.
- Look at that.

38:23.560 --> 38:26.600
I can't believe it.
We were just working on it.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.480
That's Castlegard, all right.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.240
It's different.
That right section, I had wrong.

38:31.880 --> 38:35.040
- Where did that tower come from?
- What if my Dad's in there?

38:36.160 --> 38:39.040
- Yeah, you're right.
- How are we gonna get in?

38:39.240 --> 38:40.520
Guys, soldiers coming.

38:40.720 --> 38:42.120
- You there!
- Come on.

38:42.280 --> 38:43.880
Why aren't you packing up?

38:44.360 --> 38:46.640
- Run! Run!
- Halt! Stop!

38:46.840 --> 38:49.680
- Go, go, go, go!
- Don't let them get away!

38:57.800 --> 39:00.320
Get that horse out of the way!

39:18.520 --> 39:20.160
My lord!

39:26.280 --> 39:28.840
- Pick him up.
- Come on, my friend.

39:29.040 --> 39:31.600
- Who are they?
- We captured them in the village.

39:37.440 --> 39:40.080
I am Lord Oliver.
Who speaks for you?

39:41.160 --> 39:43.960
- I do, my lord.
- You speak strangely.

39:44.720 --> 39:47.280
Yes, we are Scottish, my lord.

39:47.800 --> 39:52.080
Scottish? You've come
to kill us all in our beds?

39:59.240 --> 40:01.920
First the old man
and now this group.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.720
Why do the Scottish
find this village so pleasing?

40:04.920 --> 40:08.040
- It must be your lord's kind manners.
- Indeed it must.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.880
My lady.

40:11.560 --> 40:14.560
- I beg your pardon, my lord.
- Let him speak.

40:14.760 --> 40:19.040
- My lord, the old man you spoke of...
- Edward De Johnness?

40:20.760 --> 40:22.920
He claims he's a magister.

40:23.360 --> 40:26.240
- Do you know of him?
- He's our master, sir.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.760
- All is well with him?
- He said he was alone.

40:31.040 --> 40:34.840
We were several days behind him.
He does not know we are here.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.600
Who are you?

40:44.200 --> 40:47.680
Yes, you. The one whose head
is touching the ceiling.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.800
François, my lord.

40:52.080 --> 40:53.680
A Frenchman.

40:54.320 --> 40:58.040
Hold. Please. Please.
We're all gentlemen here.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.680
He's our interpreter, sir.

41:02.040 --> 41:05.880
Forgive them. I'm at war with the
French, as well as the Scottish.

41:06.360 --> 41:09.520
Have I forgotten anyone?
The Spaniards, am I at war with them?

41:11.720 --> 41:15.240
Arnaut has sent many spies
into my midst.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.480
- No, he's not a spy.
- No?

41:18.360 --> 41:21.280
- He's our friend.
- I'm sure he is.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.640
He's too tall to be a spy, anyway.

41:33.080 --> 41:36.200
- Interpret.
- Be quiet.

41:39.920 --> 41:41.160
Interpret.

41:44.600 --> 41:47.920
- I'm a spy.
- I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.

41:51.080 --> 41:52.800
- It means...
- Be quiet, François.

41:54.920 --> 41:57.640
...I am a spy.

41:57.840 --> 42:00.360
My God, it's a miracle.
A quiet Frenchman.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.120
- Did you hear that?
- No.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.600
Louder, boy! Come on!

42:06.200 --> 42:08.160
I am a spy.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.640
I thought so.

42:23.160 --> 42:26.360
- Oh, my God!
- Get rid of the Frenchman.

42:26.560 --> 42:28.760
Put them with the old man.
We may need them.

42:28.960 --> 42:30.640
Who's next?

42:30.840 --> 42:32.760
- No!
- No, Chris!

42:32.960 --> 42:35.160
Don't! Don't!

42:36.200 --> 42:39.640
Oh. François. François.

42:44.280 --> 42:45.920
Inside!

42:48.720 --> 42:51.240
- Up! Move it! Move it!
- No! Don't push me!

42:51.440 --> 42:53.280
- Hey, leave her alone!
- Move it, ease on!

42:54.120 --> 42:57.080
- All right, you bloody Scottish!
- Hold on!

42:57.400 --> 42:59.160
I'm moving!

43:00.160 --> 43:03.040
Over here, Andre.
This way. Come on.

43:08.680 --> 43:11.240
My marker. Guys, I lost my marker!

43:11.440 --> 43:14.240
Don't worry, we only need one marker
to get home, OK?

43:14.440 --> 43:16.960
- This can't be happening.
- Careful with the rest.

43:17.160 --> 43:19.400
Those bastards killed François.

43:29.400 --> 43:31.120
Professor.

43:32.600 --> 43:34.240
Professor!

43:34.760 --> 43:36.320
- Kate?
- Yeah.

43:36.520 --> 43:41.440
- Kate. Oh, my God, Kate.
- Are you all right?

43:41.640 --> 43:44.280
Oh, my God. You got my message.

43:44.680 --> 43:46.600
Chris, your dad.

43:46.800 --> 43:50.240
- Chris is here and Marek's here.
- Dad?

43:50.440 --> 43:51.720
- Son.
- Dad.

43:51.920 --> 43:54.560
- Chris, my son.
- Glad you're still alive.

43:54.760 --> 43:57.000
Oh, God.

43:58.600 --> 43:59.800
What happened?

44:00.400 --> 44:04.120
- You've lost such blood.
- It's not my blood.

44:05.280 --> 44:07.000
It's François'.

44:08.200 --> 44:10.040
He's dead.

44:10.240 --> 44:12.520
Oliver had him killed
because he's French.

44:12.680 --> 44:16.280
This guy had a sword
and he just ran him through.

44:18.680 --> 44:20.720
Professor, what happened?

44:21.320 --> 44:26.520
I was trying to avoid the English,
but they found me in the monastery.

44:26.720 --> 44:29.640
I convinced Oliver I was a magister
on my way to Dublin.

44:29.840 --> 44:32.040
I skipped Shakespeare.
What is a magister?

44:32.240 --> 44:35.200
- It's a scientist.
- He accused me of being a spy.

44:35.400 --> 44:39.680
- How did you survive that?
- I promised Oliver a new weapon.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.040
What kind of weapon?

44:41.720 --> 44:46.280
A liquid fire so intense
that even water couldn't harm it.

44:46.600 --> 44:50.440
Greek fire?
You promised him Greek fire?

44:50.640 --> 44:54.000
Professor. I'm sorry, have you
considered what you may have done?

44:54.200 --> 44:57.280
You've given the English
a serious advantage in this battle.

44:57.480 --> 45:00.600
- They're supposed to lose the war!
- I was alone!

45:00.800 --> 45:03.600
- Marek. Marek!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.

45:04.040 --> 45:06.480
The point is,
when these guys come here,

45:06.800 --> 45:10.800
and take us up to La Roque.
when they seal that place off for battle,

45:11.000 --> 45:13.240
there is no escape.
We're as good as dead.

45:13.440 --> 45:16.360
- No, we gotta get out of here now.
- Wait, wait, wait.

45:16.560 --> 45:18.960
Remember that field
where the peasant huts were?

45:19.160 --> 45:22.240
That's the closest place
with enough room to use the marker.

45:22.440 --> 45:24.880
- How do we get there?
- We have to do it fast.

45:25.080 --> 45:28.240
- We've got four hours.
- Four hours is plenty.

45:28.440 --> 45:31.720
The way I see it, we've got 650 years
of knowledge on these guys.

45:31.920 --> 45:35.760
There's no reason why we shouldn't
be able to get home in 20 minutes.

45:35.960 --> 45:38.520
- OK, let's find a way out.
- Let's look around.

46:08.200 --> 46:10.560
There's a hole here
big enough to climb through.

46:11.720 --> 46:14.400
- Quiet!
- OK, all right.

46:18.520 --> 46:21.480
She was with the group
we caught earlier, my lord.

46:21.680 --> 46:25.000
May I ask why
you're trespassing on my land?

46:32.160 --> 46:33.320
Come, come.

46:33.600 --> 46:35.520
- What are you doing?
- Here's what I'll do:

46:35.720 --> 46:40.000
I'm gonna scale down the wall. When
it's clear, I'm gonna let you guys out.

46:40.520 --> 46:42.560
- All right.
- You're not going anywhere.

46:42.760 --> 46:44.440
What? I am, I'm...

46:44.920 --> 46:47.800
Marek, I'm the best climber,
I am the best climber.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.120
If anyone should
be going, it should be me,

46:50.320 --> 46:53.280
but those roof slats won't
hold me, or you, or you, Chris.

46:53.480 --> 46:54.760
- No, no...
- Wait. Wait.

46:54.920 --> 46:57.200
But they might hold you, Kate.

46:58.400 --> 47:01.760
Now, Kate, this isn't a game.
Are you prepared to take a life?

47:02.440 --> 47:04.960
I'll do what I have to do.

47:05.720 --> 47:08.440
There's no way.
You're not going anywhere.

47:08.680 --> 47:10.560
It's going to be all right, OK?

47:10.760 --> 47:14.360
There's one thing worse than
dying here, and that's living here.

47:14.560 --> 47:18.080
I refuse to do either.
I'm going. It's OK.

47:18.280 --> 47:19.640
She's right.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.480
Kate.

47:22.720 --> 47:27.200
- Please, please take care.
- Hey, it's easy. It's gonna be easy.

47:28.800 --> 47:31.560
Chris, I need your help. Come on.

47:31.760 --> 47:35.400
I need you to hold that back
and keep it open.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.440
All right?

47:43.880 --> 47:46.000
- Kate, be careful.
- OK, here I go.

47:46.200 --> 47:47.760
- Easy.
- There's guards there.

47:47.960 --> 47:49.200
I'm gonna go up and over.

47:49.400 --> 47:52.080
- There's a window on the side.
- OK, watch yourself.

48:22.280 --> 48:24.320
I got you! I got you! Hold on!

48:25.800 --> 48:28.920
Hold on. I got you. Don't let go.

48:29.320 --> 48:31.640
- Are you OK?
- I've got a foothold.

48:31.840 --> 48:34.560
- We're gonna pull you back in.
- No, I'm good.

48:34.960 --> 48:38.200
- OK, please be careful.
- I've got to keep going.

48:40.600 --> 48:43.880
You, man! Gather those children
and move!

48:44.040 --> 48:46.880
All clear on the outside.

49:20.560 --> 49:23.440
Hold your line, men! In position!

49:28.560 --> 49:32.600
Too much ale.
We'll play again when I get back.

49:34.880 --> 49:36.440
Keep them quiet.

50:02.520 --> 50:05.320
- What the...?
- Now!

50:14.000 --> 50:15.840
Grab a weapon!

50:17.360 --> 50:20.120
- Let's go, Chris!
- Very sorry.

50:20.320 --> 50:23.120
We're heading out the way
we came in, all right? Marek?

50:23.320 --> 50:25.120
- Marek!
- Yeah, yeah. You go ahead.

50:25.320 --> 50:27.840
- I'll take the rear.
- All right, let's go!

50:28.040 --> 50:30.280
Kate, we gotta go.

50:42.280 --> 50:44.280
Oh, be careful!

50:46.080 --> 50:47.480
Let's go! Come on. Let's go!

50:48.120 --> 50:49.520
Quiet.

50:52.360 --> 50:54.480
You guys go ahead.
I'll catch up with you.

50:54.680 --> 50:56.320
- What are you doing?
- Listen.

50:56.520 --> 50:57.920
- Are you crazy?
- Let's go.

50:58.120 --> 51:00.960
- I got my marker, I'll catch up.
- Come on.

51:02.840 --> 51:05.520
- Where is he?
- He'll catch up. He's got his marker.

51:09.960 --> 51:12.960
- Robert!
- Yeah?

51:13.320 --> 51:17.520
DNA streaming should
be online...now.

51:17.720 --> 51:19.360
- Got it!
- Fully functioning?

51:19.560 --> 51:22.320
- Yeah!
- It's a start.

51:44.760 --> 51:46.760
- Don't move. Don't say a word.
- Traitor!

52:01.200 --> 52:05.160
Jesus. Why didn't you listen to me?

52:15.640 --> 52:17.000
Shit!

52:23.720 --> 52:26.680
For God's... Jesus!
Scotsman! Stop, it's me!

52:26.880 --> 52:28.400
Stop!

52:36.320 --> 52:38.600
What? What are you saying?

52:39.320 --> 52:40.800
Ax! Give me the ax!

52:41.000 --> 52:43.200
And help me watch for the wall!

52:43.400 --> 52:45.640
Move that stuff!
Put it against the door!

52:48.200 --> 52:50.240
- Help me!
- Get out of the way, woman!

52:50.920 --> 52:52.160
Get out of the way!

53:02.840 --> 53:05.680
Please! Come on!
There we go!

53:12.440 --> 53:13.920
Go!

53:21.840 --> 53:23.960
Guards!

53:27.560 --> 53:30.240
- Who is that guy?
- His name is De Kere.

53:33.160 --> 53:36.000
Come on. Quick,
let's head back to the river.

53:36.200 --> 53:37.760
Get more guards!

53:38.320 --> 53:41.120
- We're not going without Marek.
- I don't give a shit about Marek.

53:41.320 --> 53:44.240
My job was to get the professor.
I can't take care of you.

53:44.440 --> 53:48.280
I lost Gomez, Baretto. You guys are
on your own. Or follow me. Let's go!

53:55.200 --> 53:57.120
To the river, quick.

54:03.360 --> 54:06.040
We have a field buck.
Somebody's trying to come back.

54:06.240 --> 54:08.320
- How strong?
- It's minimal.

54:08.520 --> 54:11.920
- What does that mean?
- It means they're still alive.

54:19.320 --> 54:20.880
Halt!

54:27.920 --> 54:29.600
Come on. Come on.

54:30.120 --> 54:32.760
Where is he? Where's Gordon?

54:32.960 --> 54:34.400
Where's...?

54:34.600 --> 54:37.880
- There he is. There he is.
- I saw him. Come on!

54:38.520 --> 54:41.160
- Wait. Watch it.
- Chris! Drop your weapon.

54:43.520 --> 54:45.320
OK. Go.

54:46.480 --> 54:48.240
Oh, shit.

54:48.440 --> 54:51.040
- Come on!
- Gonna leave us like you left my dad?

54:53.240 --> 54:55.840
- People are looking.
- There's no time.

54:56.040 --> 54:58.680
- Listen. Listen.
- Everybody is looking.

54:58.880 --> 55:01.840
- Be quiet.
- Kate, hit your marker.

55:02.200 --> 55:04.240
Press yours.
I'm not going without Marek.

55:04.440 --> 55:06.760
- Hit your marker.
- You're not going anywhere.

55:06.960 --> 55:08.800
Marek's got his own marker.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.840
Search every building
and every farm!

55:11.040 --> 55:12.720
- Oh, shit.
- Kate, press it.

55:12.920 --> 55:16.200
We can come back for Marek.
Press it. We've been here too long.

55:16.360 --> 55:17.920
- Press it.
- It's not working.

55:18.120 --> 55:20.760
- It's not working.
- I know how to do this.

55:20.960 --> 55:22.600
- Why isn't it?
- I don't know.

55:22.800 --> 55:27.200
- If it were working, we'd be home now!
- Everybody, walk away slowly.

55:27.400 --> 55:29.000
Let's find a place to hide.

55:29.200 --> 55:31.360
Infantry, spread out. Search the huts!

55:40.320 --> 55:44.080
Search everywhere and capture them!

56:03.080 --> 56:07.320
Oh, by the way,
my name's Andre Marek.

56:10.560 --> 56:13.200
Castlegard was your village, wasn't it?

56:15.040 --> 56:19.640
- Don't worry, you'll return there soon.
- No.

56:19.840 --> 56:23.600
The English will burn it to the ground
before they move to La Roque.

56:23.800 --> 56:27.200
- No, La Roque will fall too.
- Yes.

56:27.600 --> 56:29.680
But it will take many more lives

56:29.880 --> 56:33.040
and many months of fighting
before it happens.

56:33.240 --> 56:37.200
The French built that fortress.
We know how strong it is.

56:44.080 --> 56:47.080
La Roque will fall tonight.

56:47.280 --> 56:52.640
Only a prophet...or a fool
could make such a claim.

56:54.720 --> 56:58.040
In your case, it's probably the fool.

57:01.280 --> 57:04.600
Whichever makes you smile like that.

57:11.280 --> 57:14.880
Are you...married?

57:15.080 --> 57:16.920
No.

57:17.120 --> 57:20.960
We've been fighting the English
since before I was born.

57:21.160 --> 57:23.720
There's no time for marriage.

57:24.640 --> 57:26.200
Of course.

57:26.600 --> 57:31.440
Are you with...anyone?

57:31.640 --> 57:33.080
- Am I with anyone?
- Yeah.

57:34.200 --> 57:36.200
I'm with you.

57:36.400 --> 57:41.640
I know. I know.
What I mean is, is there someone...?

57:41.800 --> 57:44.320
Is there someone that you see?

57:44.520 --> 57:46.920
- Do I see?
- Yeah.

57:47.120 --> 57:50.080
Nobody. It is possible
they are hiding on the shore

57:50.280 --> 57:52.440
or in the woods.
They could be anywhere.

57:52.640 --> 57:56.040
Oh, God. You know, it's funny,

57:56.240 --> 57:59.800
but we're speaking
the same language,

58:00.000 --> 58:03.240
but you don't understand
anything I'm saying, do you?

58:03.440 --> 58:06.280
Get them!

58:20.640 --> 58:22.480
No, no.

58:24.440 --> 58:27.760
It is good. They are French.
They will help us.

58:34.320 --> 58:37.360
- You're Lady Claire.
- Lady?

58:37.560 --> 58:40.560
I like that. It's charming.

58:43.720 --> 58:45.120
Dame Claire.

58:52.240 --> 58:54.040
Fire!

58:57.960 --> 58:59.200
Fire!

59:16.440 --> 59:18.880
Find them!

59:38.000 --> 59:40.360
I killed that man.

59:42.080 --> 59:44.480
I've gotta live with that.

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.160
- In here!
- We found them!

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:09.160
- We found them, my lord!
- Over here now!

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.160
- Come on!
- Don't let them go!

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.120
Come on!

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.760
Go inside!

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.920
Go around the back.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.800
- Shut up and move over there.
- Come on.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.320
- Burn it.
- No.

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.120
- No, you can't do that!
- Don't.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.480
Chris, please get out of there.
Chris!

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:44.200
Chris! My son's in there!
Chris, get out of there!

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.640
Hold your man.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.560
No! No!

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.840
All right, come on.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.480
- Come on.
- Chris, wait up.

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:17.960
- Come on.
- Wait up.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.240
- Claire!
- Arnaut.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.440
He is very grateful
you returned his sister...

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.720
- You're English.
- No, I'm Scottish.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:31.040
Arnaut, he saved the life
of one of your men.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.080
- You're Scottish, huh?
- Yes.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.640
In that case, I do not know how
to express my gratitude.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.640
Well, you can. Just keep
her close and keep her safe.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.160
- I can take care of myself.
- Yes, that's obvious.

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:49.320
Please, do not let her out
of your sight, especially tonight.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.440
Do not worry, she will be
well protected.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.480
I must leave. I must return
to Castlegard to search for my friends.

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.400
I need to ask you perhaps
for a horse and a weapon.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:02.320
You will not make it alive
through the English lines.

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.760
They are moving from the village
to La Roque. We attack tonight.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:09.160
- You must not go back there.
- I must try and find my friends.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.320
I'm sorry.

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:16.080
Very well. I will give you
what you ask for.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:19.120
- Thank you again.
- Thank you.

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:26.320
- Lady Claire...
- Claire.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:32.240
I wish we had met at another time.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.120
Andre Marek.

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.480
Are you married?

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.800
No.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.360
Arnaut?

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.360
Arnaut has dismounted,
and he's with his sister.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:36.480
Well done.
In fast, kill Arnaut and out.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:40.000
And may God be with you.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.800
All right. I have to get inside
La Roque and find my dad.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.520
- You'll never make it through.
- I'll find a way.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.160
There is no way. You'll get killed.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.720
Oh, Jesus. Go, go.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.920
- I don't have a choice.
- Yes, you do.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.320
There's another way.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.880
- What, the tunnel?
- Yeah.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.360
You never found it.
You don't know it exists.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.480
- There's always been a rumor.
- Yeah, but that's a rumor.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.080
- My dad's life is on the line.
- All of our lives are on the line.

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.840
Look, if that tunnel ever existed,
it's going to exist now, 1357.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.160
I know it's in that monastery. I know it.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.040
I wanna save your father
as much as you do.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.920
You have to trust me,
I know it's there.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.000
I know it.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.520
You've got to trust me.

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.920
Stay in line.

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.800
- Move along.
- Keep the pace!

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.680
Kill Arnaut!

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.440
Claire!

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.080
Claire! Claire!

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.560
Move along!

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.000
Come on, lads.

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:22.720
That's Marek! Marek!

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:25.359
- Marek!
- I'm OK.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.520
It's Chris and Kate, Marek.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:32.600
- What about Chris and Kate?
- They didn't make it.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.040
- They've killed them.
- What?

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.560
Been a while, hasn't it, Frank?

01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:49.000
Oh, my God.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:50.840
I thought you were dead.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.000
Right, that's why you sent Taub
to assassinate me.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.800
Not to assassinate you,
to bring you home.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.439
- Right, just like you are.
- No, look... Listen.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:04.240
- Listen to me, Will. I need your help.
- What's this?

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:06.200
Look, it's not working anyway.

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:09.359
It says here you got less
than one and a half hours left.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.680
- It doesn't work.
- Bullshit.

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.760
Look, you've got to believe me,
it wasn't my fault, OK?

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.399
- I've got a family.
- Yeah?

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.760
- You've met my family.
- You got a family?

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.000
- You have a family.
- I've got a family.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.319
- So did I!
- No!

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.520
- No!
- No! No!

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.920
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:41.279
Last time I saw him, he was running
with his marker for an open space.

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:45.120
I was on the ground,
three arrows in me.

01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:51.800
I used to be William Decker.
ITC employee number 273.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.319
Now...

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:57.240
...I'm Sir William De Kere.
Lord Oliver's aide-de-camp.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.960
You looked pretty impressive today,
Marek, for an academic.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:05.800
- How do you know my name?
- I know all of your names.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:10.080
We read every report out of your dig
before we made the first trip back.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.280
How many times have you been here?

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.880
Enough to know
transcription errors intimately.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.360
Transcription errors?

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:24.200
Doniger, that son of a bitch.
He hasn't told you a thing, has he?

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.320
What are transcription errors?

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.480
Mistakes in the DNA
reconstruction process.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.360
- It's like faxing a fax.
- Distortions. Mistakes.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.360
Only the distortions
aren't in the letters.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.320
It's body parts. The organs.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:45.400
I've gone in too many times.
I'll never survive another trip.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.000
All that damage,
it can be repaired, but not here.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:53.040
And not in this time.
You'd have to go back.

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.560
Why don't you press the marker?
We can all go home, Decker, huh?

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.000
My name is De Kere.
This is my home.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.360
Lord Oliver awaits his Greek fire.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.080
After that, your survival depends
on your knowledge of history.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.760
How good you make me look.
I rise in favor, so do you.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:14.800
I fall, you fall.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.440
I fall, you fall.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.520
Marek, where's your marker?

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.800
De Kere, Decker, whatever
his name is, he took it off me.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.080
Oh, God.

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.280
We're friends of
Edward De Johnness.

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.880
- Edward De Johnness.
- The magister.

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.280
He's my father.

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.800
- The Englishmen have harmed him?
- We don't know.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.480
- We were gonna ask for your help.
- Yeah, we need your help.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:56.960
Come.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:05.280
We need to hurry.
We don't have much time.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.840
Lord Oliver demands
a demonstration before nightfall.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:52.400
It would be best
not to miss the deadline.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.040
They've done it. The stuff's all there.

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:05.040
This stuff's a bit coarse, but it's good.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.680
What am I talking about?
I can't do this.

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:12.400
I can't give them Greek fire
and influence the course of history.

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.760
- I may already have done that.
- What do you mean?

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.840
When we first arrived here,
we were helped by this girl

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.520
who took us up to Castlegard.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.520
In fact, that's who I went back
to get when we escaped.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.320
That girl turned out to be
Lady Claire, Arnaut's sister.

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.920
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.680
I've delivered her to the French
for safekeeping.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:36.520
She's incredibly important.
Her death rallies the French to win.

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.160
- Don't you understand?
- Keep it down, OK?

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:42.960
Now we have to be on Oliver's side
just to stay alive.

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.960
This is exactly where I was digging.

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:51.680
This is it. This is the place where...
We're here. We're...

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.440
What do you mean?

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:56.520
This is the chamber
where I was working.

01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:00.320
- I'm sorry, what did he say?
- The army of Arnaut is ready to attack.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:04.120
- We're running out of time.
- Those are the stairs. It's under here.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:14.160
Move them up here.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:30.000
There's a goodly number
of trebuchets, my lord.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.160
What's a little fire
to these stone walls?

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.760
- There's nothing down here.
- This is it.

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.480
This is the chamber.
This is where the hole was.

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.000
- We came down here...
- There's nothing here.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.200
Marek would've been working there.
The box would've been...

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:11.160
Oh, my God. That is the box.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:14.120
That's the parchment he wrote on.

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.240
My father's glasses.

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.400
- Yeah, we've got to go.
- No, no, put it back.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:30.400
If we don't find this, in the future
we're never gonna find your father.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.800
Put it back.

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.920
We still gotta go.
We gotta get up to La Roque.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:38.560
No, the stone relief was damaged.
Somebody had damaged it.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:42.720
"What kind of son of a bitch
would damage something so..."

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.880
It was me.

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:51.240
It was me.

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.920
I was the son of a...

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.240
What is she doing?

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.040
Wait! Get back! Stay back!

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.200
Watch out. Watch out.

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:25.760
Oh, wow. It's the tunnel.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.680
It's the tunnel!

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:32.880
Give me a torch.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.960
Hey, give me that one,
Kate, watch out. Let me go in.

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.600
- Get Arnaut?
- Yes, get Arnaut. Go.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:46.200
- Please, hurry, Hurry.
- Kate, get in here.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.200
- Oh, whoa.
- You got it?

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.480
Yeah, I do.

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:54.160
Careful, boys, this is Greek fire.
You can blow us all to hell here.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:58.120
Smooth and easy, now.
No spills.

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:01.360
That's good.

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.640
- Trebuchet!
- Trebuchet!

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:52.600
- Trebuchet!
- Trebuchet!

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.000
Shit.

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.800
- You OK?
- Yeah. Hurry, there's no time.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:17.240
- Trebuchet!
- Trebuchet! Trebuchet!

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.080
Bring water!

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.800
Lord Oliver, the magister
with your demonstration.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.680
Oh, yes, I'll see it now.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:31.440
- Understand, my lord, I've never...
- Show me now!

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.680
- Show him!
- Your fire of the Greeks.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:46.040
- Marek, fire it!
- OK, come on, let's move it.

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.680
Trebuchet!

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.600
Just fire the damn thing!

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.880
I cannot fire it.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.760
Fire it!

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:02.080
- Fire!
- Ready, fire!

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.320
Out of the way. Move.
Let me pass.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.920
That's it?

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.440
So you betrayed me.
You promised me Greek fire.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.360
I should have had you hung...

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:33.360
- What?
- With your permission, my lord.

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.520
The more water, the more fire.

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.760
Good.

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.560
Better.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.000
My God, you are a magician,
not a magister.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:58.520
I want this for every cannon.
How many men will you need?

01:19:58.720 --> 01:19:59.880
- Twenty.
- Twenty.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.320
- Give this man 20 men.
- As you wish.

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:05.120
This way, magician.

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.520
Archers to the battlements!

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:03.600
- Archers to the battlements!
- Archers to the battlements!

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:08.320
- We have 81%.
- No, no. It's over.

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.800
I'm not gonna play with their lives
like this.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.480
We can't get 100% efficiency
from patched-together coils.

01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:16.400
What's the safest minimum percent?

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:20.160
- We've done successful tests at 80%.
- You just said we have 81%.

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.040
- They were inanimate objects.
- With reflectors up.

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:25.120
- How much time do we have?
- 28 minutes.

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:26.480
No room for error.

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.400
- They could be deformed.
- Can we?

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.240
- Yes, we can.
- It's too risky.

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.360
You think I'm gonna let you
leave them?

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.520
- Think I want to?
- I don't think you care.

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:36.600
They have a chance,
some kind of life.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.720
No, you lost the chance for that
decision a long time ago.

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:44.200
- This is no longer your decision.
- You know what? It is and I have.

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.240
I'm sorry.

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:49.960
- Fire the moat.
- Yes, my lord.

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:53.200
Fire the moat!

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:16.400
- Light your arrows.
- Light arrows.

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:26.360
- Archers, prepare.
- Archers, prepare.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.560
- Stretch.
- Stretch.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.760
Away!

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:14.080
- Night arrows.
- Night arrows.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.080
A little surprise for the French.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:18.480
- Ready!
- Stretch.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:20.000
Away!

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:53.000
We're close now.
We're close. I know it.

01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:54.760
Great.

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:06.720
Well done, my lord.

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:46.440
Trebuchet!

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.920
One more of them,
and we become history.

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.640
Oh, no.

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.640
No.

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.760
We're going.
Forward, right maybe.

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.640
Maybe it's just...

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:17.240
Or we could go up, right?
We could go up.

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:20.480
- Kate...
- No, don't. No! No!

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.480
- Kate.
- No.

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.120
Kate.

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:29.200
Maybe we missed something.
Maybe we made a wrong turn.

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.680
- We could...
- It's too late.

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:33.880
It's just too late.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:41.800
I said trust me,
and I've let you down.

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:45.280
And I've let your father down. And...

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.360
- I've let everybody down.
- No.

01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:52.840
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
- No, you didn't.

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.040
Kate, come here.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:56.720
Kate, come here.

01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:59.800
Come here. Come here.

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:15.880
- Close the inner gates!
- Close the inner gates!

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.320
- This is growing tiresome.
- The courtyard is secure, my lord.

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.360
Good, but this Frenchman
needs to be put in his place.

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.640
- It's time.
- Captain!

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:29.520
It is time!

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:43.200
Robert.

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.480
Thirteen minutes left.
Let's try and get them back.

01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:49.160
Are we gonna go over all this again?

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.360
What are you doing?

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:56.520
What the hell do you think I'm doing?
I'm protecting our interests.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.200
- What's happened to you?
- How many lives are lost

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.000
on the cutting edge
of discovery?

01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:05.800
- It's the price for great advances.
- These were kids, not astronauts!

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.400
- I know!
- They had no idea!

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:10.440
Even worse when they're deformed!
You know the media.

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:13.440
They'll twist it around
and label it a "death machine".

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:16.200
- It has a serious flaw!
- And you'll fix it.

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:19.080
- No, I won't.
- Like you fixed everything else.

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.880
- No.
- What?

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.240
- You won't?
- No, I won't.

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:27.560
I can't believe you'd just throw away
your place in history.

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:31.440
- I already have, we're cycling up.
- Think you can go behind my back?

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:35.400
Huh? Kramer!

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Kramer?

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:52.920
- Make the prisoner ready.
- What is your will, my lord?

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:55.360
- Back to work.
- Secure her to the battlements.

01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.840
I want to be sure
the French can see her.

01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.720
At once, my lord.

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:04.280
- I'll give your brother a choice.
- Oh, shit.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.920
- You are to be tied to the battlements.
- What?

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:10.360
Either he lays down his arms

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:14.160
or he kills you
with his own weapons.

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:19.920
Let us hope a man who stoops
to using his own sister as a spy

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:22.440
still has some sense of decency left.

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.840
God be with you, lady.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.560
It's her.

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:40.200
It's Lady Claire.

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:42.840
I delivered her
to Arnaut for safekeeping.

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:45.520
- How did the English get her?
- It's history.

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:50.800
Then history will change.

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.000
Oliver.

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:06.080
Release Lady Claire
and bring her down to me now,

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:09.680
or by God.
I will destroy your arsenal.

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:12.440
- Marek! No!
- Get the hell out of here. Go now!

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.200
Halt!

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:18.760
For God's sake.
If that thing blows, it'll kill us all.

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:21.760
- Bring her down.
- No! Do not touch her!

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:27.600
My lord, if he drops the torch,
he then kills her too. He will not do it.

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:30.560
Back off, De Kere.
Or Decker, or whatever your name is.

01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:34.160
I will blow your arsenal to hell!

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:44.160
- There's no way out.
- You're English.

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:47.320
- No. No, no, we're not.
- You're English! This is a trap!

01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:51.120
- Run, my lord!
- Marek!

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:55.040
- You are working for Oliver.
- No, we're not.

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:56.880
I will kill both of you!

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.200
Down!

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.800
- Yeah!
- Yahoo!

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:16.120
Be careful, my lord.

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:19.840
Archers, to the battlements!

01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:23.080
Here.

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:32.920
- Hold the line on the east tower.
- Oliver!

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:36.000
Kill her! Now!

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.640
- Arnaut!
- Claire!

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:52.440
We've got to find the others.

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:04.680
Don't!

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:10.840
Hold your line!

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:20.720
- Dad.
- Chris, you're alive! Kate, thank God!

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.920
- Where's Marek?
- I don't know.

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:51.240
There goes Marek.
There's Marek.

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.400
It's OK. It's OK, Claire.

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:09.240
It's me. It's me.
It's me. It's me. It's me.

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.800
- What are you doing?
- Open the gate.

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.800
Chris, stop!

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:27.080
- It's solid.
- Let me get up. I've gotta get up.

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:28.760
- Can you?
- Yeah.

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:00.360
This is for France.

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.720
- We gotta get out of here.
- Where's Marek?

01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.840
- I don't know.
- He went after Lady Claire. There.

01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:50.600
No!

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:56.080
My ear! My ear!

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:03.040
It's me.

01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:06.680
It's me.

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.360
- It's not working.
- Well, it's broken.

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.880
- OK.
- I gotta get Marek.

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.560
De Kere took his.

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:38.960
- You guys run to the field.
- Not without you.

01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:43.320
Kate! Run to the center of the field and
wait for us. I'll get the other marker.

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:45.480
- Dad, go with her. Go!
- Be careful.

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:51.440
Over here.

01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:54.080
Marek!

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.000
Chris, I thought you were dead.

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:01.960
Your marker! Let's go!

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.760
De Kere!
De Kere has yours.

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.560
Stern!

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:14.280
Open this door.

01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:17.400
Where's Kramer?

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.640
Where's Kramer?

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:25.560
Shit!

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:31.000
Take me home. Please.

01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:37.720
Go!

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:46.480
- It's working. Be careful.
- Come on, let's go.

01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:48.600
- Marek, come on.
- Get out of here!

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.920
We got less than a minute!
Let's go home, come on!

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:54.520
Come on, let's go!

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:57.320
Let's go, man!
Come on, they're waiting!

01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:00.240
- Go. Get the hell out of here.
- No, let's go home!

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:05.400
I am home, Chris.

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:11.200
Chris, just go.

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.040
Say goodbye for me.

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:17.840
I'm gonna miss you, Marek.

01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:35.440
If you can do it, then do it.
One more minute. Eighty-one percent, OK?

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:38.680
- What's he doing?
- The coils.

01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:43.320
- Come on!
- This is good here.

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:53.000
- Wait!
- There he is.

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:55.640
- Wait!
- Come on! Where's Marek?

01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:57.960
- He's staying. He's staying.
- Let's go.

01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:00.560
- Push the marker.
- I am.

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:03.440
I'm getting a field buck!
Someone's coming back!

01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:05.560
What? No!

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.320
- No!
- You gotta...

01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:14.880
I don't have a marker.

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.880
I'll never get home.

01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:26.080
Where's Marek?

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:30.080
And François?

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.480
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:45.800
Hey, Kate just called
from the monastery dig.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.120
She finished excavating
the sarcophagus and wants us there.

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:50.960
- Wanna drive?
- Yeah, I'll drive.

01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:59.200
Look what I uncovered.

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:09.560
If Marek had come home with us.
what would be written here?

01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:13.640
Oh, my God.

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:16.720

Oh, my God.
