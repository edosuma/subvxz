WEBVTT

01:19.661 --> 01:21.362
People say God made the world.

01:22.231 --> 01:26.239
I never believed that God or a
Devil had power over our lives.

01:30.414 --> 01:33.120
I used to believe that
we are our own Gods

01:33.154 --> 01:35.659
and Goddesses and
we decide our future...

01:36.392 --> 01:37.663
but I was wrong.

01:38.296 --> 01:42.371
I thought if you put visions out
there the universe answers back.

01:50.253 --> 01:51.925
I'm calling you because...

01:53.929 --> 01:55.198
you were right

01:56.200 --> 01:58.170
put something out there and...

01:58.839 --> 02:00.541
something answered back.

02:01.176 --> 02:02.444
It's not what...

02:05.719 --> 02:08.692
Oh big time just please don't
come back ok? Just be safe.

02:32.807 --> 02:34.209
Amy...

02:35.712 --> 02:36.815
What's wrong?

02:38.819 --> 02:41.724
I just can't go through with
this, I'm out.

02:43.728 --> 02:44.697
Come inside.

02:50.943 --> 02:52.947
Open yourself to the spirits...

02:55.819 --> 02:56.452
now.

02:59.727 --> 03:01.462
Take a card from the deck.

03:06.340 --> 03:08.745
Are you serious, what does this
mean?

03:09.246 --> 03:13.254
The Devil card means a trap, a
trap you face and must avoid.

03:13.621 --> 03:15.691
Just focus in on the other six.

03:15.726 --> 03:17.494
I'm sorry I can't do this, I
just...

03:17.763 --> 03:18.429
Amy!

03:18.463 --> 03:19.366
I can't.

03:19.398 --> 03:21.637
You came to me for direction
this is it.

03:23.842 --> 03:26.915
Don't lose your edge, stay
strong.

03:28.350 --> 03:30.521
You're wet, take your clothes
off.

03:31.023 --> 03:32.158
I'll dry them.

03:34.129 --> 03:35.665
I'll be right back.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.504
Lavender incense, it's good for
relaxing.

03:58.143 --> 03:58.812
Come.

04:12.405 --> 04:14.777
Couldn't sleep again last night.

04:14.810 --> 04:16.146
I saw her again.

04:20.087 --> 04:22.325
Let's clear your chi.

04:28.805 --> 04:30.174
You're an open vessel

04:30.207 --> 04:31.543
for great power.

04:31.844 --> 04:33.848
You're destiny is before you.

04:46.740 --> 04:47.408
Liz.

04:47.442 --> 04:48.310
Amy, relax.

04:48.343 --> 04:49.947
Yea, I saw here the woman in the
black.

04:50.949 --> 04:53.087
I told you,
you need to learn to control

04:53.120 --> 04:55.357
your stress level and
balance your energy.

04:57.495 --> 04:59.065
Slow deep breaths...

05:24.149 --> 05:26.019
After my mom died

05:26.052 --> 05:28.925
it's like the universal energy
sent you to me.

05:30.227 --> 05:33.568
I don't know why more
people don't do this.

05:33.601 --> 05:37.408
I mean there's tarot cards,
spirit boards, Reiki...

05:37.910 --> 05:39.245
Because people would rather

05:39.279 --> 05:41.216
complicate their
lives with a concept

05:41.249 --> 05:44.489
of a God and create rules they
can feel guilty about breaking.

05:45.157 --> 05:46.961
So then they can come and pay

05:46.994 --> 05:49.132
life coach like
me. Set them free.

05:55.277 --> 05:58.150
That is herbal tea to help you
stay relaxed.

06:00.187 --> 06:02.358
This I was going to give
this to your tomorrow

06:02.391 --> 06:04.630
before you left but
since you're here now...

06:05.431 --> 06:07.401
I had this made
with very special

06:07.435 --> 06:09.305
crystals inside just for you.

06:09.772 --> 06:12.044
Don't wear it until you get
there.

06:12.078 --> 06:14.249
Put it on before you meditate.

06:14.282 --> 06:17.255
I put a new mantra in there
for you use it when you work

06:17.288 --> 06:20.528
your vision board and put all
six of your competitors on it.

06:21.429 --> 06:22.031
Now...

06:23.300 --> 06:25.204
put it out into the universe!

06:27.041 --> 06:29.178
I'm gonna win the American
Dream.

06:30.214 --> 06:32.552
You're gonna be a reality show
star.

06:36.192 --> 06:37.895
Welcome back to

06:37.929 --> 06:39.933
American Dream,
we're down to our

06:39.967 --> 06:42.104
last two multi-talented final...

06:42.338 --> 06:44.576
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, stop,

06:44.610 --> 06:46.813
just cut, cut,
wait just a second.

06:47.815 --> 06:51.056
What on earth is going on here?
You're scrolling way too fast.

06:51.356 --> 06:53.193
Maybe your brain is too slow.

06:53.226 --> 06:57.168
And maybe if your daddy had some
juice you'd be the producer.

06:57.201 --> 06:59.205
Listen you two that's
enough or you'll both

06:59.238 --> 07:01.242
be moving fast on
the unemployment line.

07:01.577 --> 07:04.115
We have a hard out so one more
time, ok?

07:04.148 --> 07:07.956
Oh, and nobody yells cut except
me, you got it?

07:07.989 --> 07:09.125
Yea, I got it.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.829
Hold on.

07:11.496 --> 07:12.733
Thank you baby.

07:15.337 --> 07:20.347
Alright, settle settle, American
Dream closing, take three.

08:43.480 --> 08:46.219

08:46.252 --> 08:49.125

08:49.158 --> 08:50.695

08:50.728 --> 08:52.566
Thank you, thank you, Snoop.
You have

08:52.599 --> 08:54.468
no idea what a big
fan of yours I am.

08:57.308 --> 09:00.782
Now it's time to see
who on this stage tonight

09:00.815 --> 09:04.355
will be named our new
American Dream winner.

09:04.823 --> 09:07.161
They'll win a
million dollars and

09:07.194 --> 09:10.167
return to the season's end,
to sing and

09:10.200 --> 09:13.440

and our other American

09:13.473 --> 09:16.279
Dream stars for
the ultimate prizes.

09:16.714 --> 09:21.624
We're down to our last two
finalists. Alex and Charlie

09:21.957 --> 09:24.128
are tied with one vote each.

09:24.462 --> 09:28.269
It's now up to a one of a kind,
the amazing Doggfather.

09:28.704 --> 09:32.779
Snoop, your vote is gonna bring
it on home.

09:33.346 --> 09:35.752
Who's gonna be are new American

09:35.785 --> 09:38.390
Dream winner

09:39.726 --> 09:42.164
Well uh keepin' it real...

09:43.366 --> 09:44.903
and true to who I am...

09:46.039 --> 09:48.911
doing my own thing and creating
my own rules.

09:49.646 --> 09:51.750
I am going to vote for the
lovely...

09:53.154 --> 09:53.821
Danielle.

09:56.794 --> 10:00.134
Sorry Snoop but you can't vote
for one of the judges.

10:01.369 --> 10:03.841
Ok, ok, ok, seriously, Danielle

10:03.874 --> 10:06.379
I got my right eye
on you though.

10:07.749 --> 10:10.020
In case you didn't
notice I have dabbled in

10:10.053 --> 10:12.559
the music industry a little bit.
In that field.

10:13.393 --> 10:16.734
So with that being said,
Alex, your

10:16.767 --> 10:20.174
singing and dancing
were "exenious".

10:20.675 --> 10:21.442
Thank you.

10:22.545 --> 10:25.651
Even though Charlie
you was kicking it, I can't

10:25.685 --> 10:29.192
ignore Alex's golden God
given one of a kind voice.

10:36.339 --> 10:37.909
So my vote goes for.

10:39.780 --> 10:40.413
Alex.

10:41.282 --> 10:43.954
Oh my God I won! I won American
Dream!

10:44.421 --> 10:46.693
Oh my... I won.

10:46.960 --> 10:49.166
Thank you so much,
Snoop Dogg, oh my God

10:49.199 --> 10:51.703
thank you so much.
This has been my dream.

10:51.937 --> 10:53.072
Congratulate...

10:53.106 --> 10:54.843
I am speechless but I just
wanted to say thank you so

10:54.876 --> 10:57.447
much to my parents, thank you
so much for everything and...

10:57.481 --> 10:59.051
Listen, tell them when you get
home. Ok?

10:59.084 --> 11:00.320
Ok.

11:00.353 --> 11:04.830
Congratulations, Alex, you are
the new American Dream winner!

11:05.063 --> 11:10.875
And you have just won a prize of
one million dollars.

11:12.077 --> 11:15.585
Alright, listen,
ladies and gentlemen be sure

11:15.618 --> 11:19.593
to watch us next as seven
gorgeous multitalented

11:19.626 --> 11:23.234
starlets enter our
pageant which tests their

11:23.267 --> 11:26.840
skills to the max for
a million dollars on!

11:27.242 --> 11:29.246
American Dream!

11:36.226 --> 11:38.364
Cut! That's a wrap.

11:38.396 --> 11:39.699
I really won a million dollars?

11:39.733 --> 11:40.701
- Yes.
- Oh my God.

11:40.735 --> 11:42.705
On time at Barry's house with
the starlets.

11:42.739 --> 11:44.276
Smile for the camera princess.

11:46.647 --> 11:48.449
That's invasion of privacy.

11:48.483 --> 11:50.988
It's called behind the scenes
footage.

11:51.022 --> 11:52.625
Get out of my face!

11:54.529 --> 11:56.233
I am starving right now.

11:56.266 --> 12:00.106
Biscuits and gravy with
smothered pototoes

12:00.140 --> 12:01.108
You know
what I'm talking about?

12:01.142 --> 12:03.446
Yea, something like that that
there.

12:03.781 --> 12:07.020
Hi, excuse me, Mr. Dogg.

12:08.257 --> 12:09.259
I'm Tony, PA.

12:10.628 --> 12:14.101
I love your new gospel album,
I am, we are

12:14.134 --> 12:17.642
your biggest fans.
Would you mind if we?

12:18.777 --> 12:19.913
You all wanna get a selfie?

12:19.946 --> 12:20.815
Yes, please.

12:20.848 --> 12:22.484
- Get in where you fit in.
- Thank you.

12:22.518 --> 12:24.021
- Come on man.
- Get up in here dog.

12:26.893 --> 12:28.297
Big smiles fellas.

12:28.897 --> 12:31.803
Mary, put your phone down.
You're needed in make-up.

12:32.805 --> 12:35.778
You two know the rules about
taking photos with the stars.

12:35.811 --> 12:37.648
Observe closely
in the tumultuous

12:37.682 --> 12:39.519
waters of Hollywood as the big

12:39.552 --> 12:43.327
director fish devours the little
production assistant minnow.

12:43.660 --> 12:46.466
You're fired! Go! Go.

12:48.670 --> 12:52.177
Sam, we good man, we all good
man they just kids.

12:54.416 --> 12:56.420
Our fans deserve some respect.

12:56.853 --> 13:00.060
Hey Sam, if they go I go.

13:01.730 --> 13:02.565
Seriously?

13:02.932 --> 13:05.838
Yea, you lose them. You lose us.

13:06.339 --> 13:10.347
Now watch as the bigger star
fishes devour the director.

13:10.614 --> 13:12.485
Seriously? What was that all
about?

13:12.519 --> 13:15.090
Must be that time of the month
for him.

13:16.326 --> 13:17.160
Maybe.

13:17.194 --> 13:18.565
So bad. Did they even get the
picture?

13:18.597 --> 13:21.470
So I thought about it and
if it's ok with you it's ok

13:21.504 --> 13:24.342
with me, but I assure you
it won't happen again. Ever.

13:25.009 --> 13:27.348
You two, you're needed in my
office.

13:29.752 --> 13:30.454
Now!

13:32.758 --> 13:33.861
Thanks, Sammy.

13:34.261 --> 13:35.431
Let's roll y'all.

13:35.464 --> 13:37.635
- You just got the peace sign.
- The peace sign, yea.

13:38.102 --> 13:40.741
Thus, the Hollywood circle of
life.

13:47.722 --> 13:50.728
Welcome to another day on a
cheesy reality show.

13:55.738 --> 13:56.773
Is that joint?

13:57.742 --> 13:59.547
Nobody uses drugs on my set.

14:01.248 --> 14:02.885
I mean it's legal so...

14:02.919 --> 14:05.391
Yea but you're stupid enough
without using drugs.

14:05.424 --> 14:07.127
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:07.895 --> 14:11.671
Whoa. You two go... do
something.

14:13.072 --> 14:15.878
I hired you to put the drama in

14:15.911 --> 14:19.184
front of the camera.
What's the prob?

14:20.421 --> 14:22.526
The problem
Barry is that I can't

14:22.559 --> 14:24.762
have my guys on set doing drugs.

14:25.063 --> 14:27.902
It effects their minds and they
screw up.

14:27.935 --> 14:30.575
Come on Sam, let's be
professional here.

14:32.646 --> 14:35.283
Besides, Carl's my go to guy.
I need

14:35.316 --> 14:38.957
supplies when the girls
show up at the house.

14:40.026 --> 14:42.030
♪ Feeling sexy then show me ♪

14:43.032 --> 14:44.670
Hey, what's up?

14:45.437 --> 14:48.443
Best season ever baby, best
season ever.

14:49.546 --> 14:51.717
I need to find another
profession.

14:54.288 --> 14:56.926
What's up baby? How you doing?

14:57.696 --> 14:58.797
Lookin' good.

14:59.298 --> 15:02.673
Hey, boss. How many scripts do
you want for tomorrow?

15:03.473 --> 15:05.076
Make it an even 20.

15:05.109 --> 15:05.811
Great.

15:06.913 --> 15:08.551
Sir, your wife called again, she
says it's important.

15:12.057 --> 15:14.161
Call her back
and tell her I will

15:14.194 --> 15:16.231
be in editing
until late tonight.

15:16.701 --> 15:18.671
I thought our editor just went
home.

15:18.705 --> 15:20.206
I'm sorry boss he's new.

15:20.239 --> 15:22.878
Yea, I can tell. Shall we?

15:23.245 --> 15:24.348
- Yea.
- Let's.

15:25.984 --> 15:27.320
Major rule, never tell the

15:27.354 --> 15:29.024
producer's wife
where the producer

15:29.057 --> 15:31.963
really is. They don't teach
you this in film school.

15:31.996 --> 15:34.670
Alright, alright I got it, I got
that too. Don't ask guest stars

15:34.703 --> 15:36.171
for photos and
try not to act like

15:36.205 --> 15:37.676
a human being
while you're at it.

15:37.709 --> 15:39.479
Also why do we need
20 copies of a script

15:39.513 --> 15:41.348
for behind the scenes
of a reality TV show?

15:41.382 --> 15:44.590
Because genius there is no
reality in reality TV.

15:45.725 --> 15:47.596
What? Whatever.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.235
Hey Carl, let's go drink.

15:52.773 --> 15:53.674
You coming?

15:54.877 --> 15:57.616
Oh no I gotta pass on that
tonight, Leslie's making dinner.

15:58.115 --> 15:59.887
So I'll just meet
you guys at Barry's

15:59.919 --> 16:01.321
house tomorrow for the diva's.

16:01.355 --> 16:04.261
You guys seen the head shots of
the new cast?

16:05.363 --> 16:06.966
To get at any one of them.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.206
Splendid relationship, may
as well be blind to the opposite

16:10.239 --> 16:13.245
sex. Besides you know Barry
gets the first pick anyway.

16:14.114 --> 16:15.852
Yea, what?
Does the producer get some

16:15.885 --> 16:18.055
special permit to hit
on anybody he wants?

16:18.624 --> 16:20.728
Man just grow a
pair and deal with it.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.365
The guy signs your paychecks.
What else do you want?

16:23.399 --> 16:25.102
I want the chicks man.

16:25.136 --> 16:27.273
That's way above your pay grade.

16:28.778 --> 16:30.379
Oh... I wouldn't mind

16:30.413 --> 16:31.315
hitting that.

16:31.784 --> 16:34.154
Careful what you say

16:34.187 --> 16:35.859
on candid camera boys.

16:35.892 --> 16:38.395
Wait, hey, Carl is that thing
still on?

16:39.397 --> 16:42.036
Have you been recording this
whole time?

16:42.070 --> 16:44.374
Listen ass-clown
if you don't delete

16:44.407 --> 16:45.879
what I said I'm
going to kill you.

16:45.912 --> 16:47.582
Hey man this is gold.

16:50.419 --> 16:53.392
So David triumphed
over the Philistines

16:53.425 --> 16:55.632
with just a sling and stone.

16:55.665 --> 16:58.269
Without a sword David defeated

16:58.302 --> 17:00.842
the giant Goliath
and killed him.

17:05.585 --> 17:07.756
Ok, kids that's all for tonight.

17:17.307 --> 17:19.411
We're gonna be late next class.

17:19.444 --> 17:21.415
You're gonna be late? Ok, that's

17:21.448 --> 17:23.788
fine.
Jessica, you forgot your bible.

17:23.821 --> 17:24.487
Thanks.

17:25.825 --> 17:27.696
Bye, Crystal, see you later.

17:28.128 --> 17:31.971
So David was a kid like me and
slew a giant? That's awesome.

17:32.004 --> 17:33.674
He was like a superhero.

17:33.708 --> 17:36.580
Oh, Chris. Superheros belong in
comic books.

17:36.614 --> 17:38.684
But they have like superpowers.

17:38.718 --> 17:41.221
Well supernatural powers, not
superpowers.

17:41.957 --> 17:43.594
Ok, what's the difference?

17:45.097 --> 17:45.765
Well...

17:46.700 --> 17:49.237
Jesus wasn't a
mutant and King David

17:49.270 --> 17:51.844
wasn't bitten by
a radio active bug.

17:52.979 --> 17:56.654
He was given power by God to win
that battle with Goliath.

17:57.153 --> 18:00.093
Now not all of us are
called to slay giants

18:00.127 --> 18:02.866
or even save the
world and we need to be

18:02.899 --> 18:05.838
content living safe
normal lives and give

18:05.872 --> 18:08.744
glory to God and the
small things we do.

18:09.377 --> 18:11.516
C'mon Pat, c'mon kiddos let's
go.

18:11.884 --> 18:13.218
Bye Ms. Crystal.

18:13.252 --> 18:15.023
Bye, see you in two weeks.

18:18.163 --> 18:20.167
You're chariot awaits my lady.

18:20.868 --> 18:22.004
Ooh, ok.

18:23.506 --> 18:25.510
Hey, there is one
adventurous thing you

18:25.544 --> 18:28.016
should do while living
your safe normal life.

18:28.049 --> 18:29.786
Really? What is that?

18:29.820 --> 18:30.888
Just say yes.

18:31.556 --> 18:33.894
we can start raising
some little aspiring

18:33.928 --> 18:36.667
super heroes of our own.
You know I love you.

18:38.570 --> 18:42.044
♪ It's so hard to be wise ♪

18:42.077 --> 18:44.582
♪ When I look in your eyes ♪

18:45.349 --> 18:48.056
Josh, I don't wanna keep going
over this.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.394
I just need more time.

18:52.330 --> 18:53.332
If we make...

18:54.836 --> 18:56.907
If we make it to the next step.
I want it...

18:58.543 --> 19:00.580
I wanna make sure it'll be
right.

19:01.082 --> 19:02.551
It'll be forever.

19:06.291 --> 19:09.397
Honestly Crystal, I'll
love you forever but I can't

19:09.430 --> 19:12.370
wait forever while you
try to make up your mind.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.668
Yea, no, no, she's great

19:27.702 --> 19:29.071
I saw her audition tape.

19:30.741 --> 19:32.812
Yea, send it over. Perfect.

19:34.081 --> 19:38.089
Yea, this is gonna be the best
season ever. Guaranteed. Yea.

19:38.323 --> 19:40.093
Girls are here in 15.

19:40.761 --> 19:42.598
Honey, can you do
something about the bags

19:42.631 --> 19:44.803
under my eyes?
They're starting to show again.

19:44.836 --> 19:46.874
Why don't you get some sleep at

19:46.907 --> 19:48.610
night instead of
whatever you do?

19:48.643 --> 19:50.313
This is the most
difficult cast of

19:50.347 --> 19:52.017
diva's I've ever
had to deal with.

19:52.483 --> 19:54.688
Barry,
I'm telling you I'm this close.

19:54.723 --> 19:56.793
I'm this close
Barry to quitting!

19:56.827 --> 20:00.000
Dominic, Dominic cool your
engines man.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.068
C'mon.

20:01.102 --> 20:02.739
They haven't even arrived yet.

20:02.772 --> 20:05.442
Have you seen this list?
Two are vegan, one

20:05.476 --> 20:08.984
vegetarian, one paleo,
three of them only gluten free.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.654
Gluten free!

20:10.988 --> 20:14.863
How am I supposed to cook food
for people who can't eat food?

20:15.263 --> 20:19.739
Their requested menu items have
no food in the food.

20:19.773 --> 20:21.843
You just get me
through this last season,

20:21.877 --> 20:23.781
I'll give you your
own cooking show.

20:24.281 --> 20:25.350
My own show?

20:25.383 --> 20:28.022
And you can use all the gluten
you want.

20:29.490 --> 20:30.492
You want a latte?

20:30.527 --> 20:31.629
Sounds great.

20:32.431 --> 20:33.867
That's the spirit.

20:34.936 --> 20:36.639
Byron, where are you?

20:37.007 --> 20:39.645
Hey, what are you doing? Let's
go, work.

21:13.847 --> 21:15.885
In this life there is spiritual

21:15.918 --> 21:16.552
warfare.

21:17.421 --> 21:19.191
If we're strong we stand against
it.

21:19.224 --> 21:20.928
Don't turn off the car, I wanna
hear this.

21:22.064 --> 21:23.399
So as we grow to know

21:23.433 --> 21:25.370
God's truth and what is real.

21:26.105 --> 21:29.311
We also know more of what
is false and we're stronger

21:29.344 --> 21:32.451
to stand against it in the
powerful name of Jesus.

21:33.252 --> 21:35.356
He never leaves us defense...

21:41.837 --> 21:44.041
...selves in a dark world.

21:44.074 --> 21:44.876
Hey babe.

21:45.578 --> 21:46.947
Did you hear that?

21:47.882 --> 21:48.716
Hear what?

21:49.986 --> 21:52.357
There was a lot of static and
then this weird sounding voice.

21:53.894 --> 21:56.098
Yea, there's a lot of bad
reception out there.

21:56.132 --> 22:00.473
No, seriously... angry almost
demonic voice.

22:01.375 --> 22:03.881
Look, I even got goosebumps
listening.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.485
Yea, that's just my animal
magnetism.

22:06.887 --> 22:08.756
Maybe we should just go home.

22:10.093 --> 22:14.903
So you think a demon just came
on the radio to go home?

22:15.370 --> 22:17.875
There's a spiritual battle going
on everywhere.

22:18.109 --> 22:19.711
Ever since Lucifer
fell from grace

22:19.745 --> 22:21.415
and signs from
God are everywhere.

22:21.749 --> 22:23.085
Seriously Josh, we may be from

22:23.119 --> 22:24.454
the same religion
but sometimes I

22:24.488 --> 22:25.891
wonder if we're
just too different

22:25.925 --> 22:27.127
in our beliefs to get married.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.798
But I have a bumper sticker
saying pray.

22:31.937 --> 22:34.174
Just have a bad feeling about
this.

22:36.513 --> 22:39.384
I think God is trying to tell me
something.

22:39.418 --> 22:42.090
Yea well little Ms. Play It Safe
you're taking a chance for once.

22:42.558 --> 22:44.728
Entering an incredible
contest which

22:44.761 --> 22:46.900
could win us a million dollars.

22:47.902 --> 22:49.606
I think it's just butterflies in

22:49.639 --> 22:51.408
that cute little
stomach of yours.

22:51.442 --> 22:54.147

exemplary Christian.

23:25.678 --> 23:28.684

24:18.416 --> 24:20.119
Don't do this, not now.

24:21.355 --> 24:23.459
I told you I was in editing all
night.

Could you take me bags to the
car? Thank you.

24:31.241 --> 24:32.878
And I'm not coming back.

24:32.912 --> 24:34.749
What are you talking about?

24:35.249 --> 24:37.353
You handpicked each actors for
the shows.

24:37.387 --> 24:40.393
Yea, and do you get how
ironically sick that is?

24:41.061 --> 24:43.399
I handpick each one
of these actresses

24:43.432 --> 24:45.737
and you turn them
into these desperate

24:45.771 --> 24:48.108
sluts who will do
anything even sell

24:48.142 --> 24:50.379
their souls to
be your next star.

24:50.413 --> 24:52.116
Shelley, calm down, calm down.

24:52.150 --> 24:54.154
We can work this out,
I can fix this.

24:54.622 --> 24:57.695
No, it's done. I thought you
loved me.

24:58.028 --> 25:00.032
Shelley, come on. We're a team.

25:00.701 --> 25:03.272
There's no slut in team, Barry.

25:03.907 --> 25:05.409
Oh nice.

25:06.579 --> 25:09.552
You know everyone always blames
the producer.

25:10.654 --> 25:12.558
What about all the
aggressive actresses who

25:12.591 --> 25:14.427
see the title "producer"
as a target over

25:14.461 --> 25:16.298
your head and throw
themselves at you and

25:16.331 --> 25:18.302
try and use you to
further their career.

25:18.937 --> 25:20.541
They go for it with
no conscience, they

25:20.574 --> 25:22.310
don't care if you're
married gay or dead.

25:22.343 --> 25:24.247
For the money, for the fame.

25:25.182 --> 25:28.088
You know... it's not all my
fault.

25:28.924 --> 25:32.565
I mean, really, really, who's
the victim here?

25:35.436 --> 25:38.175
Yea, you're right Barry, you're
the victim.

25:38.944 --> 25:41.816
No, you know what? You're the
ultimate cliche.

25:42.985 --> 25:43.620
Shelley.

25:47.595 --> 25:49.431
You know I've always
wanted to see China.

25:49.464 --> 25:51.335
You know maybe we
could go get some sushi?

25:52.705 --> 25:55.209
Sushi is Japanese, not Chinese.

alright. I gotta make sure.

26:25.369 --> 26:26.338
So are we back?

26:26.371 --> 26:27.708
Yea, Brad we're back on.

26:27.741 --> 26:29.912
Put them in the room next to
mine.

26:30.413 --> 26:31.381

26:51.388 --> 26:54.494
Alright and here we have one of
our next contestants, Isabella.

26:54.528 --> 26:57.868
I would know that face anywhere.
How are you Isabella?

26:57.901 --> 26:59.237
It's an honor to be here.

27:23.051 --> 27:24.688
I know it's your money.

27:25.456 --> 27:27.961
Ms. excuse me, are you mocha?

27:28.462 --> 27:29.430
Who are you?

27:30.432 --> 27:32.403
I'm Matt, I'm a production
assistant.

27:32.436 --> 27:33.807
What do you need?

27:34.374 --> 27:36.679
They want you on camera right
now.

27:36.712 --> 27:37.313
Fine!

27:39.317 --> 27:40.720
Brad looks tired.

27:41.354 --> 27:42.925
Yep, we're back on.

27:44.195 --> 27:45.831
So who do we have here?

27:45.864 --> 27:48.837
This is my little cutie Bella.

27:48.870 --> 27:51.676
Bella's so cute, so do you have
a boyfriend?

27:51.709 --> 27:52.376
Hi!

27:53.613 --> 27:58.323
Wait for your turn! I don't
share my camera time, please.

28:00.125 --> 28:00.760
Bitch.

28:01.696 --> 28:03.967
Well keep watching, we'll be
right back.

28:05.237 --> 28:06.471
Let's show you to your room.

28:06.739 --> 28:08.509
- Did you catch that?
- Yes.

28:10.012 --> 28:12.483
This is gonna be the best season
ever.

28:14.521 --> 28:20.132
♪ Onward and upward
and live be strong ♪

28:27.614 --> 28:28.283
Hey.

28:31.989 --> 28:34.628
Hi, I thought I saw your name on

28:34.662 --> 28:37.367
the call sheet.
Small world, yea?

28:38.369 --> 28:39.371
How you been?

28:39.772 --> 28:40.439
I'm good.

28:42.778 --> 28:44.381
Really, really good.

28:44.882 --> 28:47.554
Listen I just wanna apologize

28:48.256 --> 28:49.992
for the way that I ended things
with you.

28:50.025 --> 28:52.264
No, no, it's I...

28:54.501 --> 28:55.135
Listen.

28:56.806 --> 28:59.110
I know I went crazy
and if I were you

28:59.143 --> 29:01.382
I would have broken
up with me too.

29:02.884 --> 29:04.288
But I've changed.

29:05.390 --> 29:09.197
Nice to see that you met orange
mocha frappuccino over there.

29:10.700 --> 29:13.038
It's only gonna get worse trust
me.

29:13.906 --> 29:16.812
Well it's not so bad right now.

29:18.583 --> 29:20.487
Maybe we could hangout later?

29:21.087 --> 29:23.258
I have some half moon we
could...

29:23.292 --> 29:26.665
I gotta call my girlfriend,
we're living together now.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.170
Look, good luck with all this.

29:29.972 --> 29:31.976
It was really good seeing you.

29:32.677 --> 29:34.314
I'll see you around ok?

29:45.570 --> 29:46.739
See you later.

29:54.522 --> 29:56.459
Alright guys quiet down, settle,
settle, settle.

29:56.492 --> 29:58.295
We're gonna go for a take,
we are going

29:58.329 --> 30:00.299
to go for a take.
Settle down please.

30:00.333 --> 30:02.604
Quiet on set please, quiet on
set. Sam, you set?

30:03.873 --> 30:05.677
Welcoming dinner, take one.

30:05.710 --> 30:07.213
And... Action!

30:08.215 --> 30:11.489
Ok, ladies.
Here's your vegan, vegetarian,

30:11.523 --> 30:15.463
paleo, peanut free,
gluten free, welcome dinner.

30:19.270 --> 30:21.942
A toast to my beautiful women

30:21.976 --> 30:25.115
and the next
American Dream star.

30:25.551 --> 30:27.588
To our producer, thank you for

30:27.622 --> 30:29.626
making this
opportunity possible.

30:30.225 --> 30:32.731
Cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers.

30:39.110 --> 30:39.778
Margaret.

30:51.503 --> 30:52.136
Wow.

30:53.004 --> 30:55.008
Alright, this tastes amazing.

30:56.646 --> 30:59.985
My compliments to the chef.
You know nothing would ever beat

31:00.018 --> 31:03.291
my grandmother's home cooking
but this... it's a close second.

31:03.926 --> 31:04.761
Cut!

31:06.899 --> 31:08.736
Crystal, honey.
You can't say that your

31:08.769 --> 31:11.442
grandmother's cooking is
better than our master chef.

31:12.142 --> 31:15.584
Let's do it again and this time
take a taste and say...

31:16.150 --> 31:18.255
nothing ever beat
my grandmother's

31:18.288 --> 31:20.025
cooking but yours just did.

31:21.027 --> 31:22.665
But that's not true.

31:24.468 --> 31:26.772
My grandma just
died and my family

31:26.805 --> 31:29.444
will be watching this too,
I can't...

31:30.045 --> 31:31.683
Crystal, listen honey...

31:33.051 --> 31:37.192
no one gives a rat's ass about
your grandma. So just...

31:38.697 --> 31:41.301
Quote the lines or you're off
the show.

31:42.102 --> 31:43.305
Settle please.

31:44.474 --> 31:46.478
Alright, rolling.

31:47.615 --> 31:49.283
Alright guys let's go for

31:49.317 --> 31:50.285
another one.

31:50.319 --> 31:52.457
Welcome dinner, pickup on
Crystal.

31:52.692 --> 31:53.694
Action.

32:04.080 --> 32:04.649
Wow.

32:06.653 --> 32:08.254
This tastes amazing.

32:08.623 --> 32:10.460
My compliments to the chef.

32:13.466 --> 32:16.337
Nothing ever beat my grandma's
home cooking.

32:17.072 --> 32:17.708
But...

32:21.716 --> 32:24.387
I'm sorry, I can't, I can't lie.

32:25.021 --> 32:26.826
If I'm out then I'm out.

32:26.860 --> 32:27.561
Cut!

32:27.595 --> 32:29.565
What the bloody hell was that!

32:29.599 --> 32:30.601
I can't lie.

32:32.236 --> 32:33.271
You can't lie.

32:34.373 --> 32:35.511
You can't lie.

32:36.513 --> 32:38.517
This is a bloody reality show.

32:39.918 --> 32:41.120
You have to lie.

32:41.989 --> 32:43.727
It's called acting honey.

32:46.766 --> 32:48.837
Well I call being
disrespectful to my family

32:48.870 --> 32:50.874
and my grandma's
memory something else.

32:52.878 --> 32:55.617
So... if I'm out then I'm out.

32:56.753 --> 32:59.023
So much the better,
she certainly wouldn't have

32:59.056 --> 33:01.629
won the competition with
her lack of acting skills.

33:02.631 --> 33:04.569
Survival of the fittest baby.

33:05.268 --> 33:07.775
Crystal,
Sam didn't mean that, you're

33:07.808 --> 33:10.412
not out just...
don't do it again. Ok?

33:14.153 --> 33:15.222
Action.

33:16.626 --> 33:20.868
You know this is really
delicious. If I win this

33:20.901 --> 33:25.777
competition I'm gonna have
you be my personal chef.

33:26.077 --> 33:28.281
Well that's already where you
lost.

33:29.283 --> 33:31.556
"If I win" is a
statement submitting

33:31.589 --> 33:33.324
yourself to a higher power.

33:33.793 --> 33:36.766
I always say "when I win",
you know it opens the

33:36.799 --> 33:39.972
universal energies and
manifests that vision of me.

33:41.173 --> 33:42.578
Owning my power.

33:43.244 --> 33:45.851
When I win instead of if I win?

33:46.586 --> 33:47.185
Yea.

33:47.888 --> 33:49.559
My life coach always taught me

33:49.592 --> 33:51.796
it's always about
positive energy.

33:51.829 --> 33:54.400
Please!
So you're saying that anyone

33:54.433 --> 33:57.072
with absolutely
no talent could win

33:57.105 --> 33:59.779
this competition
just from saying

33:59.812 --> 34:02.551
"when I win"
instead of "if I win".

34:02.585 --> 34:05.322
Yea but there's more to it than
just that.

34:05.991 --> 34:07.661
Seriously, you guys are so

34:07.695 --> 34:09.196
caught up in yourselves.

34:09.865 --> 34:12.469
It's not about what
you think or what you

34:12.503 --> 34:15.375
say. It's about what you
do and who you know.

34:16.613 --> 34:18.817
You are very competitive women,
many

34:18.850 --> 34:21.521
think a gain must
come at someone's loss.

34:21.956 --> 34:25.228
If this is the prism which
through you see the world you

34:25.261 --> 34:28.970
must be prepared to deal with
the stress of the competition.

34:29.605 --> 34:31.340
Or you'll choke.

34:32.476 --> 34:34.480
Fall victim of your own nerves.

34:36.986 --> 34:38.354
I hope you choke.

34:48.743 --> 34:50.112
Hey! What do you

34:50.146 --> 34:51.148
think you're doing!

34:52.416 --> 34:54.253
Give me that camera! You're not
supposed to take picture of us.

34:55.221 --> 34:55.991
Why not?

34:57.126 --> 35:00.967
Close in on Mocha and come in
here close on Amy, ok?

35:01.001 --> 35:03.640
Because I'm a professional model

35:03.673 --> 35:05.677
and my pictures are valuable.

35:06.243 --> 35:08.481
You're taking something
personal without

35:08.515 --> 35:11.353
our permission and
it's really rude of you.

35:11.387 --> 35:13.357
You shouldn't be allowed to do
so.

35:13.391 --> 35:15.228
Alright,
ladies you all signed releases

35:15.261 --> 35:17.432
saying that we can
photograph and film you.

35:18.068 --> 35:20.039
I will see to it
personally that all

35:20.072 --> 35:22.043
those photos are on the show,
alright?

35:22.076 --> 35:23.913
So we don't have any
right to say no?

35:23.947 --> 35:25.851
Not after you sign the
contract girlfriend.

35:28.055 --> 35:30.126
Cut, cut, Chloe that was great

35:30.159 --> 35:31.393
but why'd you stop?

35:31.929 --> 35:34.399
I want you to go over to Byron,
yell at him and then

35:34.433 --> 35:37.875
throw water in his face and
then start in on Amy again. Ok?

35:37.908 --> 35:40.881
You know this is not
a competition of skill

35:40.914 --> 35:44.554
this is about exploiting.
There's no honor here.

35:45.089 --> 35:47.961
This is bullshit. You know I'm
leaving.

35:50.431 --> 35:52.771
Hey young lady I've
worked all day preparing

35:52.805 --> 35:55.176
this meal for you and
now you've ruined it.

35:55.209 --> 35:56.310
Just shut up.

35:57.547 --> 36:02.023
You'll eat your words and don't
worry they're gluten free.

36:02.056 --> 36:05.029
Hey calm down, you're gonna have
a heart attack.

36:05.062 --> 36:07.734
Amy, may I please have the
camera?

36:10.573 --> 36:11.241
Trust me.

36:13.579 --> 36:15.216
- Just for my vision board.
- Cool.

36:16.251 --> 36:17.119
Meditation.

36:18.322 --> 36:20.827
Sam! This show's going to shit

36:21.328 --> 36:21.996
let's go.

37:20.012 --> 37:23.018
Prism in what you view the
world.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.024
Blah, blah, blah.

37:26.524 --> 37:29.030
Better get ready for the
competition.

37:29.898 --> 37:33.538
I'll show those girls who's in
control of the competition.

38:44.480 --> 38:45.617
Um hi.

38:46.384 --> 38:48.488
Amy, hi, I...

38:50.894 --> 38:52.864
I wanted to see if you're ok.

38:54.367 --> 38:56.004
Everyone ganged up on you and...

38:56.037 --> 38:59.243
Ok, look I'm in the middle of
something. Can this just wait?

38:59.611 --> 39:01.916
Yea, sure I just wanted to say.

39:03.920 --> 39:07.793
I'm here if you need a friend.
Something doesn't feel right.

39:09.130 --> 39:11.969
Like I was even praying in my
room earlier and...

39:12.002 --> 39:13.506
Oh ok, you're a...

39:14.508 --> 39:17.514
you're one of those people, yea
that's right.

39:17.914 --> 39:18.883
One of what?

39:18.916 --> 39:20.520
Hashtag Jesus freak.

39:22.489 --> 39:23.858
We have an early day tomorrow.

39:23.893 --> 39:26.264
Amy, I'm just a normal person...

39:27.433 --> 39:29.870
who happens to be a big fan of
Jesus too.

39:29.905 --> 39:33.278
Yea, well I find religion too
confining. I need my freedom.

39:33.946 --> 39:35.048
Your locket.

39:37.152 --> 39:39.591
I've seen that crest somewhere
before.

39:40.158 --> 39:41.695
Yea, it was a gift.

39:49.310 --> 39:50.913
Let's just quit,
I can call my boyfriend

39:50.947 --> 39:52.416
and he can meet
us on the street.

39:52.449 --> 39:53.418
- Quit, really?
- Yes.

39:53.451 --> 39:54.053
Wow.

39:56.925 --> 39:59.931
I've heard of people freaking
out before a competition

39:59.965 --> 40:02.704
but you're taking this
to a whole other level.

40:03.305 --> 40:06.044
Absolutely crazy to the second
power.

40:06.679 --> 40:10.319
People don't achieve their
dreams because they simply quit.

40:11.187 --> 40:13.458
I thought you Christians had
faith.

40:14.995 --> 40:16.331
Go get some rest.

40:16.364 --> 40:17.534
[Crystal Yea, but Amy your

40:17.567 --> 40:18.468
locket is just...

40:18.502 --> 40:19.236
Goodnight!

40:44.220 --> 40:47.092
Why does she have to put
everything in Latin?

42:00.573 --> 42:01.675
Where's Chloe?

42:03.177 --> 42:06.317
After the fight at dinner she
said she was leaving.

42:06.350 --> 42:07.921
We're down to six.

42:07.954 --> 42:08.689
Seriously?

42:09.691 --> 42:12.329
Then where the bloody hell is
Mocha and Lucy?

42:12.597 --> 42:13.899
- Sir.
- Yes.

42:13.933 --> 42:15.770
Mocha said she wasn't coming to
the rehearsals.

42:15.803 --> 42:16.437
What?

42:17.540 --> 42:19.209
She said modeling with rank
amateurs is beneath her.

42:19.243 --> 42:19.978
Excuse me?

42:20.813 --> 42:22.584
And then she
offered to take Lucy

42:22.617 --> 42:24.453
shopping and they're both out.

42:26.090 --> 42:27.660
Could you sign this?

42:27.694 --> 42:29.064
Yes, of course.

42:29.096 --> 42:29.998
Right there.

42:30.498 --> 42:31.668
Yea, right there. Copy.

42:31.702 --> 42:32.837
There you go.

42:34.708 --> 42:37.847
Wait till you see these outfits,
you're gonna die.

42:37.880 --> 42:39.718
Bloody hell, four...

42:41.120 --> 42:42.924
Four, we're down to four.

42:42.957 --> 42:43.792
Yea.

42:43.826 --> 42:45.696
They're dropping like flies.

42:46.263 --> 42:47.967
And we only in rehearsals.

42:50.106 --> 42:53.444
We haven't even started the
first emulation round yet.

42:53.478 --> 42:54.948
Why are you smiling?

42:54.981 --> 42:56.618
- This is great man.
- What!

42:56.652 --> 42:58.154
We'll script it in.

42:58.656 --> 43:01.494
This is the heart of
reality television.

43:01.528 --> 43:04.868
Low class, rude behaviour,
everyone can relate to it.

43:05.670 --> 43:08.374
Listen, we'll keep Mocha
and Lucy on we'll just

43:08.408 --> 43:11.213
change the hook,
we'll make it "Difficult Divas".

43:11.247 --> 43:13.118
And we'll play it up
every chance we get, lot's

43:13.152 --> 43:14.921
of bitching.
I can't wait to see our ratings.

43:16.023 --> 43:17.627
If the stress doesn't kill us
first.

43:17.660 --> 43:19.463
Boss, the coffee you ordered.

43:19.496 --> 43:21.134
Ah my morning drugs.

43:22.136 --> 43:24.674
Barry, you're gonna give me a
aneurism.

43:26.010 --> 43:27.345
You want something? Want a

43:27.379 --> 43:29.150
Valium?
Can you get him a Valium?

43:29.184 --> 43:32.156
How about a cup of tea,
perhaps with some cyanide in

43:32.190 --> 43:35.228
it... and excuse me,
Almond milk, yes? Two sugars, no

43:35.261 --> 43:38.034
almond milk, bring oat milk,
no oat milk, soy milk,

43:38.067 --> 43:41.273
no soy milk just bring me
the cow I'll milk it myself.

43:42.677 --> 43:43.779
- You alright?
- Shut up.

43:45.315 --> 43:47.018
Are you sure you don't want
something a little stronger?

43:47.052 --> 43:48.789
Just keep your hands
off me please.

43:50.258 --> 43:52.530
Make sure it's in enter frame
safe.

43:53.165 --> 43:54.032
What's this?

43:54.667 --> 43:56.204
Why are you dressed like that?

43:56.538 --> 43:58.175
I hate you so much.

44:00.345 --> 44:02.884
Relax Sam, a couple of male
models called in sick. I needed

44:02.917 --> 44:04.052
stand-in's for the catwalk

44:04.086 --> 44:05.556
segment and the
guys volunteered.

44:07.193 --> 44:08.896
What it's just rehearsals.

44:08.929 --> 44:11.066
Just point the camera and shoot.

44:11.100 --> 44:12.302
I'm outta here.

44:13.605 --> 44:14.908
You bet, thank you very much.

44:14.941 --> 44:16.711
Yea,
yea you're outta here alright.

44:21.320 --> 44:22.389
What up, Snoop?

44:22.422 --> 44:24.527
Yea, what's up. What's
happening?

44:24.561 --> 44:27.032
You liked Taylor Young's
performance, yea?

44:27.065 --> 44:28.202
Oh what a lady.

44:28.569 --> 44:30.338
And that song she wrote.

44:30.371 --> 44:33.212
Hey shit! Da da... That's an

44:33.245 --> 44:36.585
amazing lyrications.
I like that.

44:36.618 --> 44:37.253
Exactly.

44:38.322 --> 44:40.058
Well Taylor wrote a song
just for you and she wants

44:40.091 --> 44:42.763
to sing it with you when we
have her back on the show.

44:43.599 --> 44:45.302
Give me a little bit of it,
how it

44:45.336 --> 44:47.472
sound? Is it a slow
song or a fast song?

44:49.009 --> 44:50.846
Ok, it's something like...

44:52.350 --> 44:57.192
♪ Eclipse she came together
when the lights when out ♪

44:57.226 --> 44:58.094

Oh check this out, Snoop.

45:04.507 --> 45:05.976

45:14.761 --> 45:17.867

45:26.016 --> 45:27.353

46:13.979 --> 46:16.050

46:17.319 --> 46:20.826

46:21.093 --> 46:23.230
That's cause you got small
balls.

46:25.702 --> 46:26.337
Yea.

I think it was a glitch.

47:58.421 --> 48:00.091
And a creepy one man.

48:04.668 --> 48:07.305
What do you think they're gonna
do tomorrow?

48:08.475 --> 48:10.846
Spider ew!

48:13.552 --> 48:14.219
What?

48:14.621 --> 48:16.290
Spiders freak me out.

48:16.323 --> 48:17.527
Sorry I'm late.

48:18.294 --> 48:21.166
Come sit here between me and the
spider queen.

48:21.199 --> 48:21.901
Ha ha.

48:21.934 --> 48:24.272
Hey Barry, you seen Brad?

48:24.306 --> 48:25.942
Forget Brad, I'll do it.

48:26.477 --> 48:28.783
Alright guys, settle,
settle, settle,

48:28.815 --> 48:30.819
we're gonna go for a take,
let's do this.

48:30.852 --> 48:33.626
Quiet on set please. Bonfire
scene.

48:33.858 --> 48:35.563
And action.

48:35.862 --> 48:38.167
Well girls now that
you've all told us what

48:38.200 --> 48:40.540
you would do with a
million dollars if you're

48:40.573 --> 48:42.544
the next winner of
American Dream I can

48:42.577 --> 48:45.147
understand why you're
all competing so intensely.

48:45.583 --> 48:48.354
Last night we started
talking about this but things

48:48.387 --> 48:51.159
got a little out of control
so let's start again.

48:52.061 --> 48:55.334
Why do you think you're gonna
win this competition?

48:56.203 --> 48:58.340
Mocha, have a seat.

49:00.344 --> 49:02.817
Well I am gonna
win because I have

49:02.851 --> 49:05.956
been practicing for
years and I'm sorry

49:05.989 --> 49:08.696
but if you don't
practice and hone

49:08.729 --> 49:11.702
your skills,
you're never gonna win.

49:11.735 --> 49:14.372
Either you're born with it or
you're not.

49:14.907 --> 49:16.512
You can't practice.

49:17.111 --> 49:21.522
Me here I don't need competition
I was born this way.

49:22.088 --> 49:23.559
Too bad for you.

49:23.592 --> 49:25.962
There's plastic surgery for
that.

49:32.375 --> 49:34.881
That's strange, that's gas fire

49:34.915 --> 49:37.520
there's no wood,
they don't spark.

49:37.754 --> 49:39.055
You ok, Machiato?

49:39.389 --> 49:40.927
No, I'm not ok.

49:42.261 --> 49:45.034
And I'm so sick with all of you
bitches.

49:45.067 --> 49:48.273
Chloe had the right idea
leaving. I don't need this.

49:49.209 --> 49:52.750
Whoa, seems as if
one of our divas is really

49:52.784 --> 49:56.758
steamed. Whoo. Amy,
last night at dinner you said

49:56.792 --> 49:58.762
you believed it's all
about positive thinking,

49:58.796 --> 50:01.501
about saying "when I
win" instead of "if I win".

50:01.535 --> 50:02.201
Yea.

50:03.203 --> 50:05.543
We need to get our power back.

50:05.576 --> 50:10.686
We need to free of this dogma
and rules that mankind created.

50:10.720 --> 50:14.459
Wait, so you're not saying that
you don't respect God's will?

50:15.796 --> 50:18.166
That we shouldn't respect his
laws?

50:18.836 --> 50:21.273
If you really believe
in that piece of

50:21.306 --> 50:23.679
medal around your neck,
what is that?

50:24.078 --> 50:25.917
The cross is just
a glorified piece of

50:25.950 --> 50:27.820
jewelry.
What's that gonna do for you?

50:28.186 --> 50:31.092
It's not the cross, it's what it
stands for.

50:31.562 --> 50:33.531
For the message of the cross is

50:33.566 --> 50:36.037
foolishness to those
who are perishing.

50:36.069 --> 50:37.774
But to those who are being saved

50:37.807 --> 50:39.578
it's message is
the power of God.

50:39.978 --> 50:43.051
I was raised Jewish and
I believe. I don't always go

50:43.083 --> 50:46.089
to temple on Saturdays
but I believe there is a God.

50:46.456 --> 50:49.128
How on earth can you live
without bacon?

50:49.831 --> 50:51.802
Jewish people can't have bacon,
right?

50:51.835 --> 50:53.672
That's orthodox Jews.

50:53.706 --> 50:55.207
When I was a baby...

50:56.878 --> 50:59.784
my mom was taking me to church
to get baptized.

51:01.219 --> 51:03.490
She was a devout Christian.

51:06.598 --> 51:08.969
We never made it to church that
day

51:10.773 --> 51:12.977
because a truck ran a red light.

51:15.850 --> 51:16.852
So if God...

51:19.222 --> 51:22.997
if God was in control, then why
would he let an innocent woman

51:23.031 --> 51:26.872
taking her baby to church to
get baptized die in a car crash?

51:29.811 --> 51:30.880
I'm so sorry.

51:33.151 --> 51:34.821
You weren't baptized?

51:36.123 --> 51:39.096
I just told you my
mom died and all

51:39.129 --> 51:42.169
you can ask me
is if I was baptized?

51:44.305 --> 51:46.376
No, I wasn't ok?

51:49.149 --> 51:51.822
See this, this is what I'm
talking about.

51:53.524 --> 51:55.161
Hashtag religious freak.

51:55.663 --> 51:59.904
Amy, I'm sorry that's not what I
meant.

52:00.940 --> 52:01.574
Amy.

52:02.710 --> 52:04.814
Couldn't see that one coming.

52:04.848 --> 52:07.284
Hey, this is good this is really
good.

52:08.187 --> 52:08.789
Let's...

52:09.924 --> 52:12.129
Let's have a seance
and see if we can bring

52:12.162 --> 52:14.667
back Amy's dead mother
and see who's gonna win.

52:15.535 --> 52:18.508
We can invoke the powers
from beyond and see if they

52:18.541 --> 52:21.715
tell us who's right and who's
gonna win the competition.

52:22.215 --> 52:23.584
Ok, cut!

52:23.919 --> 52:24.553
Alright!

52:25.756 --> 52:27.794
Thank you ladies, that was
great. I'll see you tomorrow.

52:28.094 --> 52:29.798
I'm outta here.

52:33.604 --> 52:35.910
The night's still young... let's

52:35.943 --> 52:38.581
just sit back and
enjoy the bonfire.

52:39.216 --> 52:42.255
Barry, you look great on camera.
You're a natural.

52:42.289 --> 52:45.261
Yea, you don't even need a host.
You got this.

52:45.295 --> 52:47.566
Yea... you two.

52:51.574 --> 52:53.443
Gotta love Hollywood.

52:59.455 --> 53:01.459
Amy, you ok? What's going on?

53:11.982 --> 53:13.251
Don't go please.

53:14.519 --> 53:15.355
I need you.

53:15.823 --> 53:17.391
I can't. I'm sorry.

53:26.978 --> 53:31.120
You think you're gonna win? You
don't have a leg to stand on.

53:53.765 --> 53:58.007
Don't worry Bella, that guy's
coming for us soon. Ok?

54:09.897 --> 54:10.531
Bella.

54:13.037 --> 54:16.343
What's the matter baby? Aww
Bella.

54:22.088 --> 54:24.226
It's just a suit of armor Bella.

54:29.169 --> 54:32.675
Oh poor Bella, it's ok.

54:40.425 --> 54:42.062
Everything's ok, Bella.

55:01.200 --> 55:03.872
Hey babe, sorry I forgot to call
you back.

55:13.457 --> 55:14.527
I came first.

55:16.363 --> 55:17.967
He'll always be mine.

55:22.742 --> 55:25.114
Yea, I would love to
come home sweetie

55:25.148 --> 55:27.385
but I have another
scene to shoot.

55:43.117 --> 55:45.556
You're checking on my call
sheets now?

55:56.176 --> 55:58.180
I don't care what time it is.

55:59.182 --> 56:02.188
No, I don't know when I'm gonna
be home either!

56:03.057 --> 56:05.562
Well I'm sorry you feel that
way. I'm sorry!

56:07.165 --> 56:09.236
You know what, no.
I'm just gonna

58:18.193 --> 58:21.032
Isabella, Isabella, where's
Isabella?

58:21.066 --> 58:24.640
Isabella is inside shaving her
legs. She really needed it.

58:25.040 --> 58:26.511
Do you have a
stopwatch on your phone?

58:26.544 --> 58:27.913
You have an alarm on your phone?

58:27.946 --> 58:29.182
Yea.

58:29.215 --> 58:31.052
Good, tell her if she's not
out here in five minutes then

58:31.086 --> 58:32.756
she's off the show
and we'll replace her

58:32.789 --> 58:34.560
with someone else.
Mocha, I need Mocha!

58:34.593 --> 58:36.797
Where's Mocha? Where is
everybody?

58:36.831 --> 58:39.770
Apparently after her
little temper tantrum last

58:39.803 --> 58:41.941
night she made good
on her threat. She left.

58:41.974 --> 58:43.443
She, she, she?

58:45.447 --> 58:49.823
Oh this is just freaking ass
craptacular!

58:50.224 --> 58:50.926
What!

58:51.661 --> 58:53.130
Sir, would you like me to move

58:53.163 --> 58:54.833
that one lounge
chair off the set?

58:55.234 --> 58:55.936
No!

59:05.589 --> 59:07.826
Excuse me Isabella?

59:08.695 --> 59:09.329
Hi.

59:10.699 --> 59:13.003
Director wants you on set like
now.

59:13.470 --> 59:16.309
Thanks, Tony, tell him I'll be
there in just a few minutes.

59:16.343 --> 59:17.512
Sure, Isabella.

59:19.984 --> 59:22.656
But the director said that
if you weren't on set in like

59:22.689 --> 59:25.327
4 minutes 10 seconds he would
kick you off the show so...

59:26.597 --> 59:27.264
Yea.

59:28.400 --> 59:31.974
Tony, could you please bring me
that towel over there?

59:32.208 --> 59:33.343
Sure Isabella.

59:34.212 --> 59:35.147
Thanks Tony.

59:35.849 --> 59:36.483
So...

59:37.351 --> 59:39.489
You wanna be a producer someday?

59:39.990 --> 59:41.661
Yea, that's the dream.

59:43.363 --> 59:45.735
Would you like to dry my back
for me?

59:47.139 --> 59:47.739
Tony?

59:50.177 --> 59:52.749
I don't wanna be that kind of
producer.

1:00:16.396 --> 1:00:17.398
Who's there?

1:00:20.705 --> 1:00:21.272
Tony?

1:00:39.943 --> 1:00:43.049
♪ Days go by from society ♪

1:00:44.285 --> 1:00:46.389
♪ I want you to take me there ♪

1:00:46.422 --> 1:00:48.694
I have died and gone to heaven

1:00:49.428 --> 1:00:52.301
Crystal, a little more puckering
of the lips.

1:00:53.204 --> 1:00:56.944
Crystal, more, more!
There we go. Love that

1:00:56.977 --> 1:01:00.819
camera. Amy,
love that camera there we go.

1:01:01.486 --> 1:01:03.390
Lovely, good. Amy...

1:01:03.925 --> 1:01:05.394
Tony says Isabella is still in

1:01:05.427 --> 1:01:06.329
the bathroom.

1:01:06.362 --> 1:01:07.299
Great.

1:01:07.331 --> 1:01:09.937
Alright girls it's just you
three. Action.

1:01:10.205 --> 1:01:12.408
Beautiful, beautiful,
pay turns.

1:01:12.441 --> 1:01:15.548
Sexier! There we go!
Nice!

1:01:15.582 --> 1:01:18.420
Yes, God is good.
Move your bodies a little more

1:01:18.453 --> 1:01:21.459
girls. Sexier, there we go.
Kisses. Beautiful.

1:01:22.729 --> 1:01:26.303
This looks terrific. You are
like three beautiful roses.

1:01:26.337 --> 1:01:28.073
Where the hell have you been?

1:01:28.106 --> 1:01:29.509
How's you find me?

1:01:29.977 --> 1:01:31.379
Did you think
that you could just

1:01:31.412 --> 1:01:32.816
get away from me?
I got the camera,

1:01:32.849 --> 1:01:34.219
I got the crew
but I got no star.

1:01:34.253 --> 1:01:35.755
You cost me a
lot of money today.

1:01:35.989 --> 1:01:36.790
Let's go.

1:01:36.824 --> 1:01:38.895
The hell she will. Who are you?

1:01:40.097 --> 1:01:40.732
Producer.

1:01:41.734 --> 1:01:43.403
I have a real shot here.

1:01:43.771 --> 1:01:46.442
The only shot you're
good for is a money

1:01:46.476 --> 1:01:49.115
shot, and besides
this isn't a discussion.

1:01:49.616 --> 1:01:51.253
Get your shit and let's go.

1:01:51.287 --> 1:01:52.956
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you

1:01:52.989 --> 1:01:53.591
to leave.

1:01:53.624 --> 1:01:54.593
What?

1:01:54.626 --> 1:01:56.330
Listen asshole there's
two ways you can leave

1:01:56.363 --> 1:01:58.301
here, in handcuffs or
on your own accord.

1:01:58.801 --> 1:02:00.338
That is after you
sign a release.

1:02:00.371 --> 1:02:01.874
Please tell me you got that.

1:02:02.809 --> 1:02:03.377
Yes!

1:02:04.211 --> 1:02:05.415
So that's how it's gonna be
right?

1:02:05.447 --> 1:02:06.250
Let's go.

1:02:06.283 --> 1:02:07.886
Ok, I'll see you later.

1:02:14.633 --> 1:02:16.403
Have a goodnight everyone.

1:02:16.437 --> 1:02:17.405
Night, guys.

1:02:17.439 --> 1:02:18.908
- Later guys.
- Night Kirk.

1:02:18.941 --> 1:02:19.643
Night.

1:02:20.278 --> 1:02:21.780
Where'd you stash it?

1:02:21.814 --> 1:02:23.483
Shrooms are in right end stand,
top

1:02:23.517 --> 1:02:25.487
drawer.
You're gonna be tripping balls.

1:02:25.521 --> 1:02:26.790
Thanks brother, they'll be

1:02:26.824 --> 1:02:28.627
something extra
in your paycheck.

1:02:28.661 --> 1:02:31.767
Oh boss, only you can find a way
to make it tax deductible.

1:02:31.800 --> 1:02:33.871
Alright Sam, the cast tonight

1:02:33.904 --> 1:02:35.173
will be three girls and Brad.

1:02:35.207 --> 1:02:38.414
What? No. Two quit and one was
fired, we got four.

1:02:39.081 --> 1:02:41.887
Apparently Crystal's a devout
Christian and she flat out

1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:43.758
refuses to attend the seance.

1:02:43.791 --> 1:02:45.661
She's going to church tonight,

1:02:45.695 --> 1:02:47.966
something about
praying for my soul.

1:02:49.336 --> 1:02:51.840
This is a good thing. We can use
it Sam. Alright?

1:02:52.308 --> 1:02:53.778
We play up the
difficult divas angle

1:02:53.811 --> 1:02:55.516
before the seance starts,
Madam Destiny

1:02:55.548 --> 1:02:57.017
will be here any minute.
You won't

1:02:57.051 --> 1:02:58.687
have to worry about her,
she's a pro.

1:02:58.988 --> 1:03:00.291
Ok? She's like one
of the best Hollywood

1:03:00.324 --> 1:03:03.229
psychics around but we
need to play this up ok?

1:03:03.831 --> 1:03:06.235
You know like a horror movie?

1:03:06.570 --> 1:03:08.407
A lot of close ups,
not too much

1:03:08.441 --> 1:03:11.847
lighting, and have someone
do some effects. Got it?

1:03:12.247 --> 1:03:13.417
Got it.

1:03:13.451 --> 1:03:16.690
Byron, Kirk. If the seance
scene gets too boring

1:03:16.723 --> 1:03:20.063
just creep it up a bit just
do something spooky.

1:03:20.865 --> 1:03:22.669
Do we get paid extra for the
effects?

1:03:22.702 --> 1:03:25.374
No, but you get to keep your
job.

1:03:26.008 --> 1:03:27.712
Copy that boss.

1:03:28.079 --> 1:03:30.351
Well ain't he a barrel of
sunshine.

1:03:39.268 --> 1:03:41.740
Bella, where's Mocha, baby?

1:03:42.775 --> 1:03:43.477
Hey...

1:03:45.481 --> 1:03:46.149
You lost?

1:03:46.984 --> 1:03:48.052
What happened?

1:03:48.787 --> 1:03:49.557
Come here.

1:03:54.231 --> 1:03:56.102
Is that blood on you?

1:03:56.135 --> 1:03:57.872
Did you get in a fight?

1:04:01.747 --> 1:04:03.116
Baby it's ok baby.

1:04:03.884 --> 1:04:04.719
Hey.

1:04:16.008 --> 1:04:18.414
I am coming for you.

1:04:46.803 --> 1:04:47.472
Damn.

1:04:48.541 --> 1:04:50.444
You are mine.

1:04:52.549 --> 1:04:55.053
Please God, please make this
car start.

1:04:56.923 --> 1:04:58.326
Please father God.

1:05:33.464 --> 1:05:34.198
Oh my God!

1:05:36.001 --> 1:05:38.608
Oh father thou art
in heaven hallowed

1:05:38.641 --> 1:05:40.746
be thy name thy will be done.

1:05:41.345 --> 1:05:42.482
Honor thy name.

1:05:45.522 --> 1:05:47.023
Oh my God what do I do!

1:05:47.659 --> 1:05:49.027
God, what do I do?

1:05:49.530 --> 1:05:51.567
I command all demons out of this

1:05:51.601 --> 1:05:53.738
car by the power
of Jesus oh God.

1:05:54.104 --> 1:05:55.975
I command all demons
out of this car by

1:05:56.008 --> 1:05:58.681
the power of holy
name of Jesus Christ.

1:07:41.621 --> 1:07:42.287
Father.

1:07:47.966 --> 1:07:51.072
I think I just exorcised a
demon out of my car.

1:07:51.106 --> 1:07:54.478
Sounds like you're involved in
some spiritual warfare.

1:07:54.847 --> 1:07:57.484
I don't know what to do.
There was like

1:07:57.518 --> 1:08:00.223
this weird goth
looking woman thing.

1:08:00.659 --> 1:08:03.329
It took over my car, it almost
killed me.

1:08:03.362 --> 1:08:05.000
I can't go to the police they're

1:08:05.034 --> 1:08:07.004
going to think I'm crazy.
Am I crazy?

1:08:07.038 --> 1:08:07.739
No...

1:08:09.241 --> 1:08:11.546
but what are we talking about,
right?

1:08:12.548 --> 1:08:14.753
Light and dark? Angels and
demons?

1:08:16.122 --> 1:08:17.525
Good versus evil.

1:08:21.498 --> 1:08:24.204
I knew I shouldn't have
come to L.A. I just had

1:08:24.237 --> 1:08:27.377
this bad intuition that
something was gonna happen.

1:08:28.180 --> 1:08:30.483
I think God was
trying to tell me

1:08:30.517 --> 1:08:33.123
not to come,
that it wasn't safe.

1:08:33.156 --> 1:08:35.259
Intuitions sometimes can be a
good thing.

1:08:36.395 --> 1:08:38.066
Right? They can warn us.

1:08:39.434 --> 1:08:43.911
Or it can prepare us for certain
challenges.

1:08:44.947 --> 1:08:47.151
Like the one you're facing now.

1:08:47.184 --> 1:08:48.855
There's a girl I met...

1:08:50.157 --> 1:08:52.360
I think she's in
danger too but she

1:08:52.393 --> 1:08:55.634
doesn't believe me, she's not
a Christian. She has this locket

1:08:55.668 --> 1:08:58.674
around her neck and it has
the symbol of witchcraft on it.

1:09:01.179 --> 1:09:03.415
She's lost but she's innocent.

1:09:06.589 --> 1:09:08.059
I'm not surprised.

1:09:09.095 --> 1:09:11.934
If you're a true follower of
Jesus well...

1:09:12.601 --> 1:09:15.240
then you're protected. If you
stay in the light.

1:09:16.075 --> 1:09:17.310
If you don't...

1:09:18.213 --> 1:09:20.316
you leave yourself open to evil.

1:09:23.422 --> 1:09:25.093
I can't go back there.

1:09:27.430 --> 1:09:30.436
I'm going straight to Josh and
we're going home.

1:09:32.208 --> 1:09:34.579
By the way Josh is my boyfriend.

1:09:35.715 --> 1:09:38.053
Well fiance. No boyfriend, no

1:09:38.086 --> 1:09:41.059
maybe,
well maybe fiance I'm hoping.

1:09:41.092 --> 1:09:42.094
I understand.

1:09:42.896 --> 1:09:43.764
You know...

1:09:44.464 --> 1:09:48.106
sometimes committing to marriage
forever...

1:09:49.609 --> 1:09:51.279
takes more courage than...

1:09:52.248 --> 1:09:53.617
exorcising demons.

1:09:54.652 --> 1:09:55.354
Yea.

1:09:57.726 --> 1:09:59.830
Tell me more about your friend.

1:10:02.268 --> 1:10:03.603
I can't help her.

1:10:06.911 --> 1:10:09.115
I can't even go back to that
house and...

1:10:10.117 --> 1:10:11.485
she's all alone.

1:10:23.778 --> 1:10:25.380
I have something for you.

1:10:26.784 --> 1:10:28.053
This is for you...

1:10:33.530 --> 1:10:35.133
and this holy water.

1:10:35.935 --> 1:10:37.638
You're going to need it.

1:10:46.022 --> 1:10:48.626
Oh I can't accept this this must

1:10:48.660 --> 1:10:51.199
be very valuable
the date is 1692.

1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:57.912
Throughout history God has
chosen certain people

1:10:58.713 --> 1:11:00.417
to help him in the fight.

1:11:02.321 --> 1:11:03.924
Like David and Goliath.

1:11:04.558 --> 1:11:05.995
You know that story?

1:11:06.029 --> 1:11:10.170
See David knew that if God was
with him well then...

1:11:12.307 --> 1:11:13.978
nothing was impossible.

1:11:19.688 --> 1:11:21.426
What am I a superhero now?

1:11:23.063 --> 1:11:25.835
I'm just a school teacher who
likes playing the violin.

1:11:26.569 --> 1:11:30.845
And David was just a sheep
herder until God called him.

1:11:40.865 --> 1:11:42.969
It's a choice you're
going to have

1:11:43.002 --> 1:11:45.006
to make of your own free will.

1:11:54.893 --> 1:11:56.597
You have a good heart.

1:11:57.464 --> 1:11:58.766
God is with you.

1:12:00.137 --> 1:12:01.974
He's going to protect you.

1:12:19.108 --> 1:12:20.377
Father, I can't.

1:12:38.813 --> 1:12:40.518
Hey guys you seen Brad? Hey?

1:12:40.918 --> 1:12:42.689
Why is Barry in this shot?

1:12:43.891 --> 1:12:45.493
He's an attention whore.

1:12:47.264 --> 1:12:50.538
Alright everybody let's get this
going, here we go.

1:12:50.571 --> 1:12:51.272
Rolling.

1:12:53.409 --> 1:12:55.080
Seance, take one.

1:12:56.816 --> 1:12:59.956
Sweet spirits...

1:13:01.292 --> 1:13:05.300
We the living are about to
seek...

1:13:06.670 --> 1:13:09.775
We are going to get
in touch with those

1:13:09.808 --> 1:13:12.949
who have passed
on to the other side.

1:13:14.953 --> 1:13:19.061
We must create a welcoming
atmosphere.

1:13:19.696 --> 1:13:23.604
To invite the spirits to answer
questions...

1:13:24.805 --> 1:13:31.185
and to deliver messages from the
great beyond.

1:13:33.957 --> 1:13:34.626
So.

1:13:36.362 --> 1:13:38.199
Does everyone here believe

1:13:39.335 --> 1:13:43.476
that it is possible to
communicate with the dead?

1:13:43.510 --> 1:13:44.579
I do believe.

1:13:46.248 --> 1:13:46.983
Yes.

1:13:47.752 --> 1:13:49.723
Yes... I do.

1:13:50.323 --> 1:13:51.058
I believe.

1:13:51.626 --> 1:13:56.469
Good, then we are in agreement.

1:14:00.477 --> 1:14:02.147
Ooh sorry.

1:14:02.849 --> 1:14:05.353
Oh, I'm sorry it's my agent.

1:14:05.855 --> 1:14:06.489
Cut!

1:14:07.859 --> 1:14:11.098
I'm in the middle of a seance
t.t.y.l.

1:14:11.600 --> 1:14:14.238
I'm really sorry, I promise it
won't happen again.

1:14:14.606 --> 1:14:15.708
Alright guys let's

1:14:15.741 --> 1:14:17.244
settle, settle, settle.

1:14:17.745 --> 1:14:18.781
Pickup on the psychic.

1:14:19.281 --> 1:14:20.016
Action.

1:14:21.018 --> 1:14:23.690
Let us all join hands.

1:14:30.671 --> 1:14:35.514
We welcome the spirits into this
house

1:14:36.115 --> 1:14:40.558
to speak with us and to speak
through us.

1:14:41.526 --> 1:14:44.298
Ohhh spirits...

1:14:45.634 --> 1:14:47.772
from the great beyond

1:14:48.941 --> 1:14:51.646
you are welcome here.

1:14:52.782 --> 1:14:58.226
We ask... that you would... make
yourself known to us...

1:14:59.027 --> 1:15:01.198
if you are in this room.

1:15:11.553 --> 1:15:12.287
Good job.

1:15:12.788 --> 1:15:15.293
Welcome, spirits.

1:15:17.798 --> 1:15:19.969
Who are we speaking to?

1:15:21.472 --> 1:15:28.185
Can you tell us who will be the
next American Dream winner?

1:15:34.331 --> 1:15:39.609
It is coming for you Amy.

1:15:40.945 --> 1:15:41.947
Who are you?

1:15:42.982 --> 1:15:45.754
It wants you... to...

1:16:16.850 --> 1:16:20.156
I command you out!

1:16:24.498 --> 1:16:26.503
There is no power

1:16:26.536 --> 1:16:28.507
on heaven or on

1:16:28.540 --> 1:16:32.648
earth greater than
the almighty God!

1:16:33.315 --> 1:16:35.754
She will be mine!

1:16:36.523 --> 1:16:39.194
You are no longer welcome

1:16:39.227 --> 1:16:42.501
in my body. I am not open to
you!

1:16:42.735 --> 1:16:48.379
I command you in the name of
Jesus who is the Christ.

1:16:52.188 --> 1:16:56.896
In the power and authority of
that name, I command you out!

1:16:57.765 --> 1:17:00.170
I command you out!

1:17:12.928 --> 1:17:14.532
Oh I am out of here.

1:17:15.534 --> 1:17:17.838
- What about your check?
- Mail it to my agent.

1:17:18.673 --> 1:17:22.515
Barry, there is something
evil in this house. I mean

1:17:22.548 --> 1:17:26.523
what we just did gave it
permission, more power here.

1:17:26.556 --> 1:17:28.560
Wow, what a performance.

1:17:29.060 --> 1:17:33.068
You need to listen to me,
you need to cleanse this house

1:17:33.102 --> 1:17:37.278
with some white sage, some
holy oil and some holy water!

1:17:37.310 --> 1:17:38.246
Immediately.

1:17:38.947 --> 1:17:40.951
You never know
when to turn it off, will

1:17:40.984 --> 1:17:43.155

Thank you and great job.

1:17:43.190 --> 1:17:44.792
Peace out my brother.

1:17:47.698 --> 1:17:49.869
Wow, she was amazing.

1:17:50.871 --> 1:17:52.708
That was some great F and X.

1:17:53.710 --> 1:17:55.046
I didn't do that.

1:17:55.079 --> 1:17:56.415
It wasn't us man.

1:17:56.448 --> 1:17:57.318
Yea, right.

1:17:58.320 --> 1:18:00.557

1:23:58.071 --> 1:23:59.709
We need you to go an get some

1:23:59.742 --> 1:24:01.713
clothes and and
come on down to the

1:24:01.746 --> 1:24:03.584
living room for questioning.

1:24:03.617 --> 1:24:05.452
Sir will you please come with me

1:24:08.191 --> 1:24:10.462
So... Crystal.

1:24:12.199 --> 1:24:13.002
Sweet roll?

1:24:16.508 --> 1:24:18.680
My name's Chief Detective
Ressler, you were one of

1:24:18.714 --> 1:24:21.117
the remaining contestants
on the American Dream show?

1:24:21.384 --> 1:24:23.288
I wasn't gonna continue.

1:24:23.321 --> 1:24:24.659
Why not? Isn't there like a

1:24:24.692 --> 1:24:26.361
million dollar prize
or something?

1:24:26.963 --> 1:24:28.700
A lot of people would kill for
that.

1:24:28.967 --> 1:24:32.473
They were going way beyond just
being a talent contest.

1:24:32.775 --> 1:24:34.946
Like last night
they were holding a

1:24:34.979 --> 1:24:37.652
seance to see who
was gonna win the show.

1:24:37.985 --> 1:24:40.624
I'm a Christian and that's
against my religious beliefs.

1:24:40.658 --> 1:24:42.459
Where were you
last night between the

1:24:42.493 --> 1:24:44.330
hours or 10pm and
5am this morning?

1:24:44.363 --> 1:24:46.167
I was at the hotel with my...

1:24:46.903 --> 1:24:48.874
with Josh... my boyfriend.

1:24:50.375 --> 1:24:52.212
I wasn't even gonna
come back and

1:24:52.246 --> 1:24:54.151
we even talked about it, but...

1:24:54.752 --> 1:24:58.760
This morning I realized that the
priest I spoke with was right.

1:24:59.629 --> 1:25:02.100
I should return and
follow through with my

1:25:02.133 --> 1:25:04.504
commitment.
So I drove back this morning.

1:25:06.141 --> 1:25:08.714

1:25:22.540 --> 1:25:25.046
for question yet, please
remain in the living room.

1:25:25.412 --> 1:25:27.885
For those of you who are
not staying here tonight,

1:25:27.918 --> 1:25:30.455
after answering our questions,
you'll be free to go.

1:25:30.758 --> 1:25:33.294

you to go to your rooms.

1:25:36.535 --> 1:25:39.508
Please do not, I repeat
do not go into any rooms or

1:25:39.541 --> 1:25:42.547
any areas that have
yellow tape in front of them.

1:25:43.182 --> 1:25:44.852
They are now crime scenes.

1:25:46.555 --> 1:25:47.289
Thank you.

1:25:54.237 --> 1:25:56.810
Chief. We can rule out...

1:25:57.309 --> 1:25:59.916
anybody here or anywhere
else for that matter,

1:25:59.949 --> 1:26:02.721
suspects. The two dead
girls killed each other.

a reality show contest, right?

1:26:07.197 --> 1:26:08.165
Are you watching the

1:26:08.199 --> 1:26:09.267
detectives on your iPad?

1:26:09.301 --> 1:26:09.969
Yea.

1:26:11.171 --> 1:26:14.443
So did you like put hidden
cameras in the bathrooms too?

1:26:18.586 --> 1:26:19.254
Maybe.

1:26:19.755 --> 1:26:21.058
That's creepy.

1:26:21.091 --> 1:26:23.095
Hey, I wonder if this is
gonna be on the news? Hey

1:26:23.128 --> 1:26:25.199

do my makeup just right?

1:26:25.233 --> 1:26:26.434
Really, Brad? You're serious?

1:26:26.467 --> 1:26:27.369
Yea.

1:26:27.402 --> 1:26:28.940
Well he's gonna need
makeup if he doesn't

1:26:28.974 --> 1:26:31.111
shut up cause I'm gonna
punch him in the face.

1:26:37.825 --> 1:26:40.831
Lab results are in, psilocybin
in the tea cups.

1:26:41.497 --> 1:26:42.868
Poor bastard.

1:26:42.902 --> 1:26:43.803
Yea, he is in no

1:26:43.837 --> 1:26:44.805
condition to talk.

1:26:44.839 --> 1:26:47.745
His vitals are stable but no
neuro response.

1:26:47.778 --> 1:26:49.080
Tied up with two dead

1:26:49.114 --> 1:26:50.984

Hollywood.

1:26:51.618 --> 1:26:53.757
Has anybody seen this guys wife?

1:26:54.291 --> 1:26:56.460
The housekeeper said she's
at the beach house, I've got

1:26:56.494 --> 1:26:58.967
somebody going down there
to bring her in for questioning.

1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:01.470
What about the contestants who
quit and the missing crew guy?

1:27:01.505 --> 1:27:02.975
I can't get anybody by phone but

1:27:03.008 --> 1:27:04.511
we're still searching
the premises.

1:27:04.879 --> 1:27:07.016
Hey, excuse me?
Could I get some coffee

1:27:07.050 --> 1:27:09.154

Black. Thank you.

1:27:09.654 --> 1:27:12.795

Yea, we were working under
cover.

1:27:23.148 --> 1:27:24.986
Anyway, we found the guy in the

1:27:25.019 --> 1:27:27.190
storage room he
was with his friends.

1:27:27.657 --> 1:27:29.661
You better take a look at this.

1:27:30.296 --> 1:27:30.964
Jesus!

1:27:31.966 --> 1:27:33.770
We have a serial killer.

1:27:33.803 --> 1:27:35.172
Some sort of satanic
symbol with six

1:27:35.206 --> 1:27:36.675
points.
What is that a pentagram?

1:27:36.708 --> 1:27:39.849
No, no, a pentagram is 5 points,
6 points is heptagram?

1:27:40.182 --> 1:27:44.324
I think a heptagram is 7 points,
6 points is a hexagram.

1:27:44.657 --> 1:27:47.263
Well whatever you wanna call it
there are dead bodies on three

1:27:47.296 --> 1:27:49.634
of the points and there's a
guys heart in the center. I'm

1:27:49.667 --> 1:27:51.038
thinking something must have
scared the murderer off last

1:27:51.071 --> 1:27:52.407
night before they time to bring
the other victims in there.

1:27:53.308 --> 1:27:55.379
The murderer probably laced the
tea cups with the hallucinogen

1:27:55.413 --> 1:27:57.683
and let the last two victims
do the dirty work for him.

1:27:57.717 --> 1:28:00.189
So that would cover 5 points out
of the 6.

1:28:00.222 --> 1:28:04.230
Meaning... missing point, that's
our missing victim.

1:28:05.433 --> 1:28:07.336
Last two contestants need to be
guarded.

1:28:07.370 --> 1:28:09.407
After we interview the
crew send them home and

1:28:09.441 --> 1:28:11.546
keep them all under
surveillance. Alright, lock

1:28:11.578 --> 1:28:13.682
down the house.
The two girls are staying here

1:28:13.715 --> 1:28:16.421
so let's post a 24 hour
guard at the back door and

1:28:16.455 --> 1:28:19.461
we'll put Max the big security
guard at the front door.

1:28:20.196 --> 1:28:22.166
Just to be safe
let's post a guard

1:28:22.200 --> 1:28:24.505
at the hospital for
our listed Romeo.

1:28:27.076 --> 1:28:30.116
Oh yea... keep the chef here on
lock down too.

1:28:31.351 --> 1:28:31.953
Why?

1:28:33.722 --> 1:28:35.226
Just do what I say.

1:28:38.031 --> 1:28:39.734
Hey Matt, are you ok?

1:28:40.102 --> 1:28:42.841
No, no, I'm not ok.
I signed up to be a part of the

1:28:42.875 --> 1:28:44.578
entertainment industry not some

1:28:44.612 --> 1:28:46.481
drug-denner,
this murder mystery.

1:28:48.385 --> 1:28:50.055
Hang on a second.
Sam had Barry's

1:28:50.089 --> 1:28:51.725
calls forwarded to my phone.

1:28:52.760 --> 1:28:53.829
Really?

1:28:53.863 --> 1:28:54.831
American Dream.

1:28:54.865 --> 1:28:56.001
What's happening?

1:28:56.034 --> 1:28:56.835
Mr. Dogg.

1:28:56.869 --> 1:28:58.739
Hi, Snoop Dogg it's Matt here
too.

1:29:00.242 --> 1:29:03.448
Barry's not answering your calls
because he was carried away.

1:29:03.482 --> 1:29:04.717
Is she cute?

1:29:04.751 --> 1:29:07.558
No, no, like physically carried
away by the paramedics.

1:29:07.891 --> 1:29:09.727
The whole show was
shut down too and now

1:29:09.761 --> 1:29:12.366
everybody is talking about
these witchcraft murders.

1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:14.103
Ok, ok, ok, seriously.

1:29:14.137 --> 1:29:15.607
Seriously Mr. Dogg there are

1:29:15.640 --> 1:29:17.611
detectives all
around the house and

1:29:17.644 --> 1:29:19.280
every bodies
either dead or being

1:29:19.314 --> 1:29:21.017
investigated except for Barry.

1:29:21.519 --> 1:29:22.286
Oh wow.

1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:23.722
He's in some kind of coma.

1:29:23.755 --> 1:29:26.061
You know like Han Solo in
carbonite.

1:29:28.498 --> 1:29:33.008
They say it was anaphylactic
something cause by psi...

1:29:33.408 --> 1:29:34.277
Psilocybin.

1:29:34.912 --> 1:29:35.779
Look it up.

1:29:36.081 --> 1:29:38.252
We're supposed to go to the
hospital.

1:29:38.285 --> 1:29:39.989
I still think we should go home
instead.

1:29:40.022 --> 1:29:42.159
You got to walk back again man.

1:29:42.594 --> 1:29:43.930
See you at the hospital?

1:29:43.963 --> 1:29:46.001
You're doing an amazing job.

1:29:46.034 --> 1:29:48.005
Oh man my mom wants me to quit.

1:29:48.038 --> 1:29:49.173
You can't quit.

1:29:50.175 --> 1:29:53.549
You gotta hang in there,
Hollywood needs sane people.

1:29:54.952 --> 1:29:56.221
Wanna see Barry?

1:29:57.023 --> 1:29:58.825
Yea, whatever's left of him.

1:30:01.532 --> 1:30:02.400
Come in I have

1:30:02.433 --> 1:30:03.402
something to tell you.

1:30:03.435 --> 1:30:04.470
I have

1:30:04.505 --> 1:30:06.174
something to tell you too.
Listen I almost left.

1:30:06.207 --> 1:30:08.946
Crystal, please just shut up ok?
I have to show you something.

1:30:09.548 --> 1:30:11.184
I think I'm the murderer.

1:30:11.686 --> 1:30:14.525
The reason that Byron
wasn't here today is because

1:30:14.558 --> 1:30:17.330
he was with me last night
and when we woke up...

1:30:17.830 --> 1:30:19.834
his heart was on this
pillow but he was gone but

1:30:19.867 --> 1:30:21.806
his heart was there
and it was still beating.

1:30:21.838 --> 1:30:23.175
Amy, Amy, there's nothing there.

1:30:23.208 --> 1:30:25.045
You're not a the murderer,
I know you're not.

1:30:25.079 --> 1:30:27.718
Really, really? Then how do you
explain this?

1:30:28.085 --> 1:30:29.688
How do you explain this!

1:30:29.722 --> 1:30:32.493
No, you just can't be the
murderer. You just can't!

1:30:33.629 --> 1:30:36.969
But the murders have something
to do with this board.

1:30:38.472 --> 1:30:41.579
This parts in Latin. I teach
Latin in my class.

1:30:44.217 --> 1:30:46.856
Amy, do you know what this
mantra says?

1:30:47.858 --> 1:30:49.327
It says I offer
myself and these six

1:30:49.360 --> 1:30:51.498
sacrifices to you.
Have you been saying this?

1:30:51.532 --> 1:30:52.701
I thought it was a
positive statement

1:30:52.734 --> 1:30:54.070
just to put out
into the universe.

1:30:54.103 --> 1:30:55.139
Oh yea well they're out there

1:30:55.172 --> 1:30:56.207
alright,
you do realize that this is

1:30:56.241 --> 1:30:58.378
witchcraft?
And offering sacrifices,

1:30:58.412 --> 1:30:59.982
where did you get all this?

1:31:00.015 --> 1:31:03.155
From my life coach Liz but she
just puts harmless forces out of

1:31:03.188 --> 1:31:05.459
nature and just
positive energies

1:31:05.492 --> 1:31:07.229
and that's it,
it's all harmless.

1:31:07.597 --> 1:31:10.369
Yea well a lot of dead people.
Ok...

1:31:11.004 --> 1:31:14.343
Liz what? What's her name? Does
she have like a website?

1:31:14.377 --> 1:31:17.349
It's: I see for you
life coaching dot-com

1:31:17.383 --> 1:31:19.020
Alright, let's look this up.

1:31:26.434 --> 1:31:28.739
You have the same
locket and I looked up what

1:31:28.773 --> 1:31:31.110
that symbol means,
did she give it to you?

1:31:31.144 --> 1:31:32.747
Yea, it was a gift.

1:31:32.781 --> 1:31:33.950
It's a family crest

1:31:33.982 --> 1:31:36.522
mixed with a satanic symbol.
It actually belonged to the

1:31:36.555 --> 1:31:39.160
Williams family back in the
1600's. Here I'll show you.

1:31:41.799 --> 1:31:43.870
In 1692 in Salem,
Abigail Williams

1:31:43.903 --> 1:31:45.874
was the first
accused witch to be

1:31:45.907 --> 1:31:47.677
burned at the stake for having

1:31:47.711 --> 1:31:49.882
sacrificed 6 young
women to the devil so

1:31:49.915 --> 1:31:52.086
that she could possess
his demonic powers.

1:31:52.453 --> 1:31:55.894
Her niece Bridget turned her in
to stop the murders.

1:31:57.463 --> 1:31:58.633
Burn her!

1:31:58.666 --> 1:31:59.935
You're gonna burn in hell!

1:31:59.968 --> 1:32:02.139
You're no family to me.

1:32:02.172 --> 1:32:05.345
How could you be my accuser? How
could you betray me?

1:32:05.980 --> 1:32:09.855
I had to stop the killings. I
curse you and your descendents.

1:32:10.422 --> 1:32:12.627
You were killing innocent
people.

1:32:12.661 --> 1:32:14.798
I could have given
you everything,

1:32:14.831 --> 1:32:16.735
we could have had everything.

1:32:17.737 --> 1:32:19.407
Her niece Bridget

1:32:19.440 --> 1:32:22.046
turned her in to stop the
murders. It is said that as she

1:32:22.079 --> 1:32:24.551
was burning at the stake,
before she died... Abigail tried

1:32:24.585 --> 1:32:27.089
to cast a spell on her niece
and her sister's descendents

1:32:27.122 --> 1:32:29.628
to carry her spirit and the
demon she had inside of her.

1:32:29.962 --> 1:32:35.005
Burn her! Burn her! Burn that
witch! Burn her!

1:32:37.009 --> 1:32:39.480
Joseph, it's time.

1:32:42.219 --> 1:32:43.121
No.

1:32:44.091 --> 1:32:45.994
Curse you and your bloodline.

1:32:47.597 --> 1:32:50.103
I send my demon upon you.

1:32:50.970 --> 1:32:54.111
He will live in you and your
children's children.

1:33:03.863 --> 1:33:06.969
You and your family
keep your eyes on Jesus,

1:33:07.002 --> 1:33:09.841
you will be safe.
And, your children's

1:33:09.875 --> 1:33:12.881
children must to all
they can to resist the

1:33:12.914 --> 1:33:16.555
temptations of the
demonic forces of witchcraft.

1:33:21.131 --> 1:33:23.301
Burn in Hell you evil witch.

1:33:34.658 --> 1:33:37.029
There was a priest there who
intervened, defended Bridget

1:33:37.062 --> 1:33:39.433
and prayed for God to
protect her and her descendents.

1:33:42.707 --> 1:33:45.245
That's the same priest I spoke
with last night.

1:33:45.278 --> 1:33:47.650
What priest? When did you talk
to a priest?

1:33:47.684 --> 1:33:49.821
All descendents in the
Williams family line are

1:33:49.855 --> 1:33:52.292
said to still carry the
birthmark from the curse.

1:33:54.931 --> 1:33:58.539
Amy, you're a descendent. You
have the birth mark.

1:33:59.340 --> 1:34:02.146
After Abigail died her ashes
were kept in a sacred vault

1:34:02.180 --> 1:34:05.018
by a coven of witches who became
Abigail's followers determined

1:34:05.051 --> 1:34:07.791
to bring the demon back through
the William's family line.

1:34:08.225 --> 1:34:10.395
It's said that they wore
Abigail's ashes inside

1:34:10.428 --> 1:34:12.399
lockets.
The lockets have small shards of

1:34:12.432 --> 1:34:14.571
mirror on them indicating
that Abigail's spirit

1:34:14.604 --> 1:34:16.909
could be scried through
reflective surfaces.

1:34:18.979 --> 1:34:20.917
Amy,
your life coach Liz is a part of

1:34:20.950 --> 1:34:22.352
that coven.

1:34:22.386 --> 1:34:24.558
She's a follower of that
cult and she is the murderer

1:34:24.591 --> 1:34:26.695
and has been using
witchcraft and demonic forces.

1:34:29.568 --> 1:34:31.538
Those are not Crystal's in your

1:34:31.572 --> 1:34:34.211
necklace,
those are ashes from the witch.

1:34:34.811 --> 1:34:38.252
Amy, this isn't you. You have to
put that down.

1:34:39.321 --> 1:34:39.955
Amy!

1:34:41.457 --> 1:34:44.764
Amy, take of the necklace. That
thing is controlling you.

1:34:46.835 --> 1:34:50.743
You're gonna have to wake up.
Put that down. Put it down!

1:34:55.353 --> 1:34:56.622
Amy, are you ok?

1:34:57.724 --> 1:34:58.325
Amy!

1:34:58.826 --> 1:34:59.628
God, help.

1:35:00.128 --> 1:35:00.830
You.

1:35:01.899 --> 1:35:02.600
You.

1:35:03.502 --> 1:35:05.339
Take off the damn necklace!

1:35:08.612 --> 1:35:09.281
Amy?

1:35:09.781 --> 1:35:10.482
Amy?

1:35:11.585 --> 1:35:13.622
C'mon, you have to destroy the
vision board. C'mon.

1:35:19.868 --> 1:35:21.838
This wasn't on here before.

1:35:21.872 --> 1:35:23.174
Just destroy it!

1:35:30.488 --> 1:35:32.159
Fuck positive thinking!

1:35:34.431 --> 1:35:36.902
When you call on forces in
the universe and you leave God

1:35:36.935 --> 1:35:39.374
out of that equation, who
do you think is gonna answer?

1:35:39.941 --> 1:35:42.112
Spirits that are not from him!

1:35:42.145 --> 1:35:44.651
And now Liz has been
using innocent people as

1:35:44.684 --> 1:35:47.657
sacrifices and been
using you to let in a demon.

1:35:47.690 --> 1:35:49.861
I didn't know!
We have one more blood sacrifice

1:35:49.894 --> 1:35:51.932
and now Liz is
gonna be out to get us.

1:35:51.965 --> 1:35:53.268
We have to call
the cops or she's

1:35:53.302 --> 1:35:54.537
gonna come back into our house.

1:35:54.571 --> 1:35:57.175
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, my
purse.

1:35:58.211 --> 1:35:59.714
Hold up, Max.

1:36:05.893 --> 1:36:06.962
She's in here.

1:36:08.799 --> 1:36:10.035
C'mon, let's go.

1:36:11.972 --> 1:36:13.675
- Oh my God, Chef Dominic!
- Oh my God.

1:36:14.176 --> 1:36:16.180
- Ok, ok.
- Ok, just call for help.

1:36:16.815 --> 1:36:19.320
- God I can't call for help!
- Go get help please, Crystal.

1:36:19.354 --> 1:36:21.324
Just go get help, go get help.
I'm fine.

1:36:24.364 --> 1:36:25.231
What's wrong?

1:36:25.265 --> 1:36:27.035
I just cut my arm it's fine.

1:36:27.069 --> 1:36:28.739
I'll be back with help.

1:36:30.943 --> 1:36:33.348
Amy, Crystal...

1:37:13.462 --> 1:37:14.096
Amy...

1:37:19.239 --> 1:37:20.041
Crystal...

1:37:47.128 --> 1:37:48.130
Nobody can stop

1:37:48.164 --> 1:37:49.266
your destiny now.

1:37:56.414 --> 1:37:58.653
You both can't run from me
forever.

1:37:59.787 --> 1:38:02.460
Amy, I just wanna talk with you.

1:38:33.822 --> 1:38:35.325
You wanted freedom.

1:38:37.128 --> 1:38:41.739
You wanted powers in the
universe to flow through you.

1:39:03.247 --> 1:39:06.353
You didn't want to have to
follow religious dogma.

1:39:07.490 --> 1:39:08.726
Or rules of God.

1:39:11.732 --> 1:39:12.432
Grow up!

1:39:14.236 --> 1:39:16.240
Nothing comes without a price.

1:39:45.767 --> 1:39:47.737
That is why we
had to get rid of your

1:39:47.771 --> 1:39:49.808
mother,
she was gonna ruin everything.

1:39:51.076 --> 1:39:52.781
We had to save
you from the baptism

1:39:52.814 --> 1:39:54.651
and leave you
open to be a vessel.

1:39:55.820 --> 1:39:59.795
Shelley helped me with that, she
gave me a key to get in here.

1:40:01.932 --> 1:40:05.304
See, I was always with you.

1:40:07.911 --> 1:40:09.581
You let Crystal is escape.

1:40:12.452 --> 1:40:15.291
That was a big mistake.

1:40:18.297 --> 1:40:20.101
We have to pay for it now.

1:40:20.937 --> 1:40:21.805
Remember...

1:40:23.307 --> 1:40:25.780
there has to be
a sixth sacrifice

1:40:25.813 --> 1:40:27.684
and it has to be a woman.

1:41:40.730 --> 1:41:44.805
Hey, Crystal it's me... my
phone's back on.

1:41:49.513 --> 1:41:50.414
Liz is dead.

1:41:54.023 --> 1:41:56.895
People see the world and say
that God created it.

1:41:58.031 --> 1:42:00.670
It's not that I never
believed in God but I can't

1:42:00.703 --> 1:42:03.208
conceive that a God or
a demon or anybody...

1:42:05.411 --> 1:42:06.413
beyond our...

1:42:07.583 --> 1:42:10.589
physical reality could have
control or power over us.

1:42:12.059 --> 1:42:14.362
I always believed in
positive thinking, we

1:42:14.395 --> 1:42:16.668
were our own God and
goddesses and that...

1:42:18.337 --> 1:42:22.411
that we master our future and
visualize our destinies and...

1:42:22.947 --> 1:42:25.920
I believe that if you put
something out there...

1:42:27.556 --> 1:42:29.292
the universe answers back.

1:42:32.199 --> 1:42:33.201
But you were right.

1:42:35.304 --> 1:42:37.075
I put something out...

1:42:45.592 --> 1:42:47.296
something answered back.

1:42:47.697 --> 1:42:49.465
Please just don't come back, ok
please.

1:43:13.147 --> 1:43:14.617
I got your call.

1:43:14.650 --> 1:43:15.652
Liz is dead...

1:43:16.520 --> 1:43:19.459
but that thing is out
to get me and it's not

1:43:19.492 --> 1:43:22.498
out to get you.
Ok, so please just go, ok?

1:43:23.334 --> 1:43:25.205
Nobody is going to die.

1:43:25.238 --> 1:43:26.875
I know how to beat this thing.
We have to

1:43:26.909 --> 1:43:28.511
make it back to the
room of sacrifice.

1:43:29.915 --> 1:43:31.083
I know how to beat this.

1:43:31.117 --> 1:43:32.586
Hey, I got your message!

1:43:34.123 --> 1:43:35.457
Came as fast as I could.

1:43:35.491 --> 1:43:36.493
Oh this is...

1:43:37.362 --> 1:43:38.231
this is Josh.

1:43:38.264 --> 1:43:38.966
Hi.

1:43:39.868 --> 1:43:41.805
Ok, we just have to move, she's
coming.

1:43:46.180 --> 1:43:48.184
Wait, the holy water!

1:43:52.760 --> 1:43:54.263
Come, come, come.

1:44:10.395 --> 1:44:12.265
I think it wants best, Amy.

1:44:12.299 --> 1:44:13.434
What do we do?

1:44:13.468 --> 1:44:15.005
I don't know, just we just gotta

1:44:15.038 --> 1:44:16.540
keep that evil from possessing.
Ok.

1:44:16.908 --> 1:44:19.013
When I was in trouble
I was talking to a priest

1:44:19.046 --> 1:44:21.150
and he said he could
help and he gave me these.

1:44:26.795 --> 1:44:28.999
We gotta close the door to
Satan and that's where we're

1:44:29.033 --> 1:44:31.505
gonna open the door to Christ.
Ok? You need to be baptized.

1:44:31.537 --> 1:44:32.639
What? What!

1:44:32.672 --> 1:44:34.543
It's the one thing your mother
never got to do for you.

1:44:34.576 --> 1:44:36.547
Guys I don't hear it anymore.

1:44:46.567 --> 1:44:48.204
Whatever you're gonna do do it
fast!

1:44:48.237 --> 1:44:50.675
Ok, alright, fine. That's
the same symbol as on your

1:44:50.708 --> 1:44:53.347
pendant. That's gotta be
where the power's coming from.

1:44:54.116 --> 1:44:56.587
That's where you need to be
baptized. Hurry, come on.

1:44:56.620 --> 1:44:57.355
Ok.

1:44:58.424 --> 1:45:00.295
Repeat after me, Lord Jesus I
repent of my sins.

1:45:00.328 --> 1:45:02.332
Lord Jesus I repent of my sins.

1:45:03.502 --> 1:45:04.571
God, help us!

1:45:07.209 --> 1:45:08.344
Josh, help us.

1:45:08.711 --> 1:45:09.680
What do I do?

1:45:09.713 --> 1:45:11.717
I don't know just do something!

1:45:15.225 --> 1:45:16.862
Do something crazy.

1:45:16.895 --> 1:45:19.834
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I rebuke you!

1:45:19.868 --> 1:45:22.772
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I rebuke you!

1:45:25.980 --> 1:45:29.153
It's the name of all names.
Right?

1:45:31.257 --> 1:45:33.227
And I saw it in the exorcist.

1:45:37.469 --> 1:45:40.876
Amy, you need to fill your being
with the holy spirit.

1:45:41.545 --> 1:45:43.381
Do you renounce
Satan and all the empty

1:45:43.414 --> 1:45:45.718
promises and all the
false glamors of sin?

1:45:45.752 --> 1:45:46.287
I do.

1:45:51.764 --> 1:45:53.902
Powers of Hell can't her back
up!

1:45:53.936 --> 1:45:55.138
Don't go, Josh!

1:46:00.014 --> 1:46:01.651
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1:46:01.685 --> 1:46:02.485
I know you...

1:46:02.520 --> 1:46:04.624
You and Amy finish the baptism!

1:46:04.657 --> 1:46:06.895
Do you believe in God and in
Jesus Christ his son?

1:46:07.897 --> 1:46:08.764
Yes, yes.

1:46:16.915 --> 1:46:17.917
- Blood of Christ!
- No!

1:46:27.469 --> 1:46:30.208
No, Jesus come into my heart. I
make you my lord and savior.

1:46:57.963 --> 1:46:59.567
What was I thinking?

1:47:01.870 --> 1:47:03.841
Not seeing right through Liz.

1:47:09.853 --> 1:47:11.090
And that vision board?

1:47:11.123 --> 1:47:12.359
Amy, just stop.

1:47:13.962 --> 1:47:15.733
Don't beat yourself up, ok?

1:47:16.968 --> 1:47:18.938
There's really nothing
wrong with vision

1:47:18.972 --> 1:47:21.578
boards... and we are
supposed to think positively.

1:47:23.347 --> 1:47:24.851
It's called faith.

1:47:27.222 --> 1:47:30.863
Just don't ever forget where
that power really comes from.

1:47:37.375 --> 1:47:39.112
You just need to love God.

1:47:49.399 --> 1:47:50.101
Yea.

1:47:53.508 --> 1:47:54.976
But that demon...

1:47:55.011 --> 1:47:56.648
That thing almost
killed us because

1:47:56.681 --> 1:47:58.017
you didn't follow the rules.

1:47:59.019 --> 1:48:01.390
People always complain about
God's rules, that they're so

1:48:01.423 --> 1:48:02.993
restricting but
they've been around

1:48:03.027 --> 1:48:04.564
a really long time for a reason.

1:48:08.772 --> 1:48:10.776
Do you think it'll come back?

1:48:13.648 --> 1:48:14.282
No.

1:48:19.292 --> 1:48:20.127
Josh?

1:48:25.071 --> 1:48:25.772
Yes.

1:48:27.308 --> 1:48:28.879
Yes, you think it's gonna come
back?

1:48:28.912 --> 1:48:29.547
No.

1:48:30.414 --> 1:48:31.149
Yes, what?

1:48:33.287 --> 1:48:33.922
Yes...

1:48:34.957 --> 1:48:36.928
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

1:48:37.462 --> 1:48:38.297
And yes...

1:48:40.434 --> 1:48:43.307
if we can survive through a
demonic attack...

1:48:43.975 --> 1:48:46.179
we can survive through marriage.

1:48:48.852 --> 1:48:49.587
I've...

1:48:50.822 --> 1:48:53.160
had this thing the whole time.

1:49:02.111 --> 1:49:03.447
Put this on you.

1:49:05.251 --> 1:49:05.953
Yes.

1:49:06.453 --> 1:49:07.455
Yea.

1:49:09.694 --> 1:49:10.829
Oh my God.

1:49:17.610 --> 1:49:18.344
Come here.

1:49:19.847 --> 1:49:20.616

1:49:27.863 --> 1:49:30.102
