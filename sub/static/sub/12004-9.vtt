00:00.127 --> 00:01.920
Previously on Switched at birth...

00:02.036 --> 00:03.146
Is that the sign for love?

00:06.507 --> 00:07.594
What is this?

00:07.797 --> 00:10.226
There are pictures of Bay
when she was four years old.

00:10.544 --> 00:11.516
How do you have these?

00:11.736 --> 00:13.836
I found out 12 and a half years ago

00:14.414 --> 00:15.253
when Daphne was three.

00:15.345 --> 00:16.832
All those years you knew about me?

00:16.896 --> 00:19.219
And you never once came for me?

00:19.220 --> 00:21.361
I did what I thought was best for you.

00:21.361 --> 00:24.559
We are going to get custody
of both of our daughters.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.270
I want her out of here.

00:31.010 --> 00:33.710
Honey, how are the scones? Any good?

00:33.740 --> 00:35.870
I don't think I had the right kind of cream.

00:37.510 --> 00:39.630
Bay, earth to Bay.

00:39.860 --> 00:41.130
I'm sorry. What did you say?

00:41.580 --> 00:42.950
How are the scones?

00:43.100 --> 00:45.440
They're good, though I think
I like your blueberry better.

00:45.720 --> 00:46.690
Good morning.

00:46.750 --> 00:49.289
Hey, dad, did you hear Brad
Murrow signed with the Jayhawks?

00:49.290 --> 00:51.029
Really? How'd they get
him away from Syracuse?

00:51.030 --> 00:53.030
Probably his jump shot. Oh!

00:53.230 --> 00:56.360
Hey! All right, you guys, hurry up.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.020
- Have a good day.
- Bye.

00:59.050 --> 01:00.879
- Bye, honey, I love you.
- I love you too.

01:00.880 --> 01:01.860
Hurry up, Bay.

01:14.810 --> 01:17.419
He's surprising me with tickets

01:17.420 --> 01:19.090
to the Ray Barretto Tribute.

01:20.720 --> 01:21.799
He doesn't know that I know.

01:21.800 --> 01:24.049
And you, Daphne Paloma Vasquez,

01:24.050 --> 01:25.580
are not gonna tell him.

02:22.860 --> 02:23.930
Thank you.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.640
Hm-mm. It's my first cup.

02:38.990 --> 02:41.464
I was letting everybody cool down.

02:47.630 --> 02:49.790
I told them everything.

02:50.110 --> 02:52.430
I don't know how else to explain it.

03:03.248 --> 03:06.749
She made that team and won
them the freakin' championship.

03:09.440 --> 03:10.750
This is different.

03:11.450 --> 03:14.100
I have never had my daughter hate me.

03:14.516 --> 03:16.630
Both daughters.

03:19.870 --> 03:21.180
I am hiding.

03:42.466 --> 03:43.097
Oh.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.526
Good morning.

03:45.711 --> 03:46.579
Good morning.

03:47.076 --> 03:48.343
Are you making a cake?

03:48.488 --> 03:49.807
Or two.

03:50.767 --> 03:54.237
I didn't know how you wanted to celebrate.

03:54.341 --> 03:57.420
Maybe we could just let this birthday slide.

03:57.714 --> 03:59.414
But it's the first birthday

03:59.414 --> 04:01.300
that we'll all be able to spend together.

04:01.300 --> 04:04.586
- We have to do something.
- Well, it's Bay's birthday too.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.310
What do you normally do for her?

04:06.587 --> 04:08.397
Usually we buy her something,

04:08.397 --> 04:10.208
which she returns for store credit.

04:10.208 --> 04:14.072
Oh mom, don't worry. I won't be
returning this year's gift.

04:14.153 --> 04:15.744
And what is that gonna be?

04:15.830 --> 04:18.370
Don't act like you don't know.

04:19.555 --> 04:23.239
She wants this Volkswagen thing.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.103
It's this dune buggy.

04:25.201 --> 04:28.150
It's an amphibious
four-wheel-drive convertible.

04:28.550 --> 04:30.002
It's a tank, but way cuter,

04:30.002 --> 04:31.309
and I can haul stuff around

04:31.309 --> 04:33.392
without inflicting another
S.U.V. on the world.

04:33.478 --> 04:35.550
What exactly do you need to haul?

04:36.099 --> 04:38.280
I don't know. Stuff.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.689
I just like the idea of
a car that's so weird

04:41.690 --> 04:42.491
they didn't know what to call it,

04:42.491 --> 04:44.670
so they just called it "The thing."

04:44.995 --> 04:48.400
And what makes you so sure you're
going to get the thing, hmm?

04:48.593 --> 04:50.070
Don't joke, please.

04:55.685 --> 04:58.912
They got Toby a car for his birthday.

04:58.912 --> 05:01.695
They have to get cars for us too.

05:01.920 --> 05:02.927
Us?

05:03.343 --> 05:05.680
Your signing's gotten really good.

05:15.947 --> 05:17.879
Do you want me

05:17.879 --> 05:19.591
to talk with her?

05:20.887 --> 05:21.887
No.

05:22.547 --> 05:24.045
I'll take care of it.

05:36.759 --> 05:37.864
What are you doing here?

05:37.939 --> 05:38.975
Watch your tone.

05:38.975 --> 05:41.300
That is your mother you're talking to.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.510
It's okay, Ma.

05:43.209 --> 05:45.372
Look, I know you're mad,

05:45.725 --> 05:48.220
but you still have to treat me with respect.

05:50.260 --> 05:52.961
I kept my secret because
I didn't want to lose you.

05:53.031 --> 05:55.697
And I am not gonna let that
happen now that it's out.

05:55.807 --> 05:56.889
I'm gonna be late.

06:03.344 --> 06:04.923
Thank you for taking over
the past couple of days.

06:04.952 --> 06:06.430
No problem.

06:07.914 --> 06:08.914
Ma.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.250
I just can't understand why
you never told me, Regina.

06:12.964 --> 06:16.475
Because... I didn't wanna be talked out
of what I decided to do.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.470
And I didn't wanna implicate
anyone else in my decision.

06:22.543 --> 06:24.250
What did you think, Ma?

06:24.851 --> 06:28.470
All these years Daphne growing
up so blonde and blue-eyed?

06:29.680 --> 06:32.290
I always assumed Angelo was right...

06:33.116 --> 06:36.230
- That she wasn't his.
- And you never asked me?

06:40.920 --> 06:44.147
I know... that you don't
understand why I did what I did,

06:44.147 --> 06:47.950
but... I could really use an ally right now.

06:52.193 --> 06:53.194
You have one.

06:54.987 --> 06:56.190
Thank you.

07:49.910 --> 07:51.599
What about getting custody of Daphne?

07:52.206 --> 07:55.445
Well, we can certainly try,
but it's a lengthy process,

07:55.445 --> 07:57.810
one that Regina will fight all the way.

07:58.106 --> 07:59.772
It can be years before it's resolved.

07:59.772 --> 08:01.808
and by then it's likely Daphne would be 18,

08:01.808 --> 08:03.520
which would make it a moot point.

08:03.607 --> 08:06.528
- Daphne doesn't even want her here.
- There's got to be some way

08:06.528 --> 08:07.951
to get Regina out of the house.

08:08.026 --> 08:09.480
You can evict her,

08:10.340 --> 08:13.210
but she has a legal right
to take Daphne with her.

08:19.942 --> 08:21.996
There we go. Come on now.

08:22.071 --> 08:23.071
Oh!

08:37.330 --> 08:41.440
Okay, everybody.
Everybody, gather round. Come on.

08:41.529 --> 08:43.299
Here we go. Here we go.

08:43.710 --> 08:46.060
Good good good. Good good good.

08:46.307 --> 08:49.957
Okay, we are all improving.

08:50.038 --> 08:51.038
It's great.

08:51.247 --> 08:53.214
Our rebounding is getting better.

08:53.642 --> 08:55.487
Our passing is improving,

08:55.568 --> 08:59.785
but we have to make sure that
that translates into points

08:59.993 --> 09:00.993
on the board.

09:01.202 --> 09:04.720
And I've also found out my new name sign...

09:05.120 --> 09:06.876
"Hard-ass with a 'J.'"

09:06.957 --> 09:10.030
I have no idea where that name came from.

09:10.104 --> 09:13.124
And I'm also planning on living
up to that name, all right?

09:13.320 --> 09:16.675
So let's go out there and
work on our offense, okay? Go!

09:16.826 --> 09:18.862
Go go go! Goodbye, go.

09:25.438 --> 09:27.509
The food is crap,

09:27.602 --> 09:31.110
but luckily, that's not
why I brought you here.

09:33.733 --> 09:34.733
The view.

09:39.350 --> 09:42.410
What do you think of that?

09:52.087 --> 09:53.087
Axe?

09:53.666 --> 09:55.459
You like axe girl?

10:06.126 --> 10:07.126
What?

10:07.225 --> 10:10.435
You don't think that I could do something

10:10.435 --> 10:11.656
that awesome?

10:15.500 --> 10:18.680
Thank you. I've been dying to tell you.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.136
Daphne doesn't know.

10:21.859 --> 10:23.490
Toby doesn't know.

10:24.005 --> 10:25.717
No one knows.

10:26.174 --> 10:27.174
Yeah.

10:27.765 --> 10:29.750
Okay, look.

10:33.954 --> 10:36.037
It's the billboard near Buckner.

10:36.147 --> 10:38.911
It's been blank for weeks.

10:39.502 --> 10:40.942
And it just keeps

10:41.757 --> 10:43.493
calling to me,

10:43.568 --> 10:46.610
"Bay, Bay, bomb me."

10:47.773 --> 10:50.046
And that's what I want

10:50.046 --> 10:51.487
for my birthday.

10:51.608 --> 10:55.692
To wake up and know that thousands of people

10:55.692 --> 10:57.867
are driving by my...

10:58.804 --> 10:59.804
art.

11:00.123 --> 11:02.795
They're thinking about it.
They're commenting on it.

11:02.893 --> 11:04.890
They're wondering who did it.

11:09.493 --> 11:11.100
How am I going to do it?

11:11.541 --> 11:14.323
I'm so glad that you asked.

11:19.824 --> 11:21.617
- Okay.
- Go go go go go!

11:21.745 --> 11:24.024
Work it down. Do one, okay? Good good good.

11:24.735 --> 11:26.777
Oh! Good good good! Hey, whoa, whoa!

11:28.310 --> 11:29.779
Two two two two two.

11:37.770 --> 11:39.410
Okay, all right, one more time.
One more time.

11:39.497 --> 11:42.372
Ladies, one more time.
From here. Number two.

11:43.592 --> 11:44.795
All right, here we go.

11:48.839 --> 11:50.053
Good good good.

12:00.373 --> 12:01.373
Hey!

12:01.963 --> 12:03.259
Hey, Daphne!

12:04.120 --> 12:06.080
Sweetie, what are you doing?
You can't do that.

12:07.574 --> 12:08.899
You know what this is about?

12:09.043 --> 12:10.090
That woman's back.

12:25.691 --> 12:27.550
I heard you got into a fight.

12:28.780 --> 12:29.804
No big deal.

12:30.035 --> 12:31.117
Are you okay?

12:31.707 --> 12:33.037
No, I'm not.

12:33.835 --> 12:36.872
You come here expecting me
to pretend like nothing happened?

12:36.970 --> 12:40.354
No, I came back here so
we could work it out.

12:40.568 --> 12:42.910
If you are here, then I'm leaving.

12:43.520 --> 12:44.520
What do you mean?

12:44.520 --> 12:46.580
I'm moving in with my real parents.

13:01.467 --> 13:05.220
I can't decide which one
I wanna put on the billboard.

13:14.187 --> 13:16.391
B-a-d.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.240
Bad? You think they're bad?

13:20.544 --> 13:24.032
Badass. Badass.

13:24.130 --> 13:25.472
Okay, I get it.

13:30.013 --> 13:31.013
Oh.

13:31.106 --> 13:32.106
Hi.

13:45.619 --> 13:46.938
You too.

13:53.850 --> 13:56.679
Oh why am I here? why? I'm... I'm... I'm...

13:56.777 --> 13:59.403
I'm visiting Emmett.

14:04.690 --> 14:07.108
Art. Art. I like art.

14:07.808 --> 14:12.135
Oh, oh, oh, photos. Yes he takes great photos.

14:18.006 --> 14:20.684
Do you want some nails... foot?

14:23.680 --> 14:26.457
Drink? I don't know
what is happening right now.

14:26.694 --> 14:29.436
There she is moving her hands **

14:34.925 --> 14:37.146
Oh I know Daphne.

14:37.846 --> 14:41.589
I don't know what this means.

15:02.130 --> 15:03.590
She's nice.

15:15.265 --> 15:16.265
Hey.

15:16.353 --> 15:19.770
I can't tell if I'm hungry.

15:20.072 --> 15:23.140
- Anything good in there?
- Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.050
Oh!

15:25.960 --> 15:27.480
Saltimbocca?

15:28.332 --> 15:30.276
- You're a vegetarian.
- Yeah.

15:30.368 --> 15:33.376
Maybe you wanna make an exception one time.

15:33.868 --> 15:36.090
No, not for veal.

15:36.670 --> 15:37.550
Sorry.

15:38.912 --> 15:40.540
There's chicken parmigiana.

15:40.844 --> 15:43.120
I just made this. This is really good.

15:43.215 --> 15:46.440
Linguini with shrimp.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.390
- Shrimp?
- Yes.

15:48.420 --> 15:50.030
- Yeah.
- I eat shrimp.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.350
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.859
Okay, well, a big bowl

15:53.860 --> 15:55.190
or little bowl?

15:56.260 --> 15:57.370
Big bowl.

17:51.657 --> 17:52.820
Can we just talk?

17:53.069 --> 17:54.150
Sorry, I'm a little bit busy.

17:54.150 --> 17:55.999
Maybe we should have scheduled something,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.847
- oh, I don't know, 13 years ago?
- I did try.

17:58.934 --> 18:02.306
Hiring a private investigator
to take creepy photos of me

18:02.306 --> 18:03.746
does not count as mother-daughter bonding.

18:03.868 --> 18:06.940
Okay, one time

18:07.587 --> 18:10.242
I snuck into your piano
recital when you were seven.

18:12.012 --> 18:14.540
During the intermission,
you were trying to get a drink of water

18:14.557 --> 18:16.830
from the water fountain,
but it was too high.

18:18.740 --> 18:20.452
I asked you if you needed help.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.737
I gave you a boost.

18:24.159 --> 18:26.705
You were so beautiful in
that little blue dress.

18:28.451 --> 18:30.678
With the butterflies and the big sash.

18:30.748 --> 18:34.360
Yeah, I wanted to just
grab you and take you home.

18:35.086 --> 18:36.769
But Kathryn came,

18:36.769 --> 18:39.470
and she took you back inside.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.982
It was so hard for me to watch you go,

18:42.982 --> 18:45.747
but I was not gonna tear
you away from your family.

18:47.066 --> 18:49.345
Or you didn't wanna look
at me and didn't want me.

18:50.068 --> 18:51.068
Of course.

18:51.502 --> 18:53.860
Of course I wanted you.

18:54.013 --> 18:56.689
It was just too painful
to be around you knowing

18:56.690 --> 18:58.550
that you could never be mine.

18:58.704 --> 19:00.820
Painful for you? What about me?

19:01.810 --> 19:04.251
My whole life I felt like I didn't belong.

19:04.355 --> 19:06.189
And I didn't know why and
I thought it was my fault.

19:06.293 --> 19:09.254
It wasn't your fault. It was mine.

19:09.492 --> 19:12.418
No! You don't get to do this.

19:28.453 --> 19:30.419
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:31.842 --> 19:34.463
I wanted to talk to you
about the girls' birthday.

19:34.723 --> 19:36.626
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

19:42.162 --> 19:45.256
Okay, I know how awkward this is,

19:45.256 --> 19:46.355
and I was hoping that

19:46.355 --> 19:49.132
we could just push past it
so we could celebrate

19:49.132 --> 19:51.064
Daphne and Bay's birthday.

19:51.156 --> 19:53.089
I'm not really sure what
we're gonna be doing.

19:53.090 --> 19:57.160
I mean, a cake at least.
Or should we do two?

19:57.160 --> 19:59.456
I know that Daphne loves red velvet.

19:59.457 --> 20:01.592
Like I said, I'm not really sure, but...

20:01.592 --> 20:04.595
Kathryn, I know you.

20:04.807 --> 20:06.463
What do you have planned?

20:07.451 --> 20:09.700
Cake, presents, family.

20:09.851 --> 20:11.361
I believe I qualify.

20:11.564 --> 20:13.987
I'm not the one who got us here.

20:14.352 --> 20:16.373
Regina, you did.

20:17.422 --> 20:19.162
And if it were up to me,

20:19.162 --> 20:21.279
I'd be willing to push past it

20:22.136 --> 20:24.116
for the sake of the girls,

20:25.156 --> 20:26.942
but it's not me who doesn't want you here.

20:26.942 --> 20:29.649
It's Bay.

20:30.442 --> 20:31.832
And Daphne.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.624
Finished, honey?

20:38.880 --> 20:40.166
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

20:41.538 --> 20:44.443
You're finally here. Good morning, honey.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.826
So, girls, how we doing?

20:48.160 --> 20:51.931
No fevers? No sore throats?

20:52.384 --> 20:53.414
- No.
- Daphne: No.

20:53.414 --> 20:54.414
Really?

20:54.848 --> 20:57.301
I wouldn't say that if someone
from Buckner or Carlton calls,

20:57.301 --> 21:00.078
'cause I just told them
that you're both sick.

21:00.078 --> 21:02.360
- We're going car shopping.
- Whoo-hoo!

21:02.360 --> 21:04.369
Oh, mom, don't do that.

21:04.606 --> 21:06.517
You're speechless. That's okay.

21:06.517 --> 21:07.583
You don't need to say anything.

21:07.583 --> 21:10.616
All you need to say is
thank you and think about

21:10.616 --> 21:12.784
what you want your vanity plate to say.

21:12.785 --> 21:15.245
You guys have done so much for me already.

21:15.429 --> 21:16.788
We wanna do this for you.

21:16.881 --> 21:18.690
We got a lot of birthdays to catch up on.

21:18.691 --> 21:20.848
It's okay. I'll work on her. Hey...

21:21.106 --> 21:22.727
Let's get you dressed for car shopping.

21:22.728 --> 21:25.454
Your new front wheel drive chariot awaits.

21:26.732 --> 21:29.401
- I'm sick too, right?
- Honey, you already have a car.

21:29.402 --> 21:32.217
- Hurry up, it's time for school.
- Move it.

21:36.987 --> 21:39.444
Oh! What's that?

21:39.445 --> 21:42.231
You wanna come home with me? Okay.

21:42.915 --> 21:46.084
Honey, can we get something
that's younger than you are?

21:46.760 --> 21:48.586
It was designed for the military,

21:48.587 --> 21:50.522
and it's kinda cute,

21:50.523 --> 21:52.657
in an ugly baby sort of way.

21:52.658 --> 21:54.245
Mm-hmm.

21:54.741 --> 21:57.575
Come on, honey, it's what she really wants.

21:58.338 --> 22:00.091
Like I'm gonna say no.

22:03.769 --> 22:07.384
You guys are gonna thank me
if we ever get invaded by Arkansas.

22:08.280 --> 22:11.149
Daphne, what about this one?
It's not too fancy.

22:11.149 --> 22:12.993
This could be your Daphnemobile.

22:12.993 --> 22:16.557
You don't have to call it "Daphnemobile."

22:17.727 --> 22:19.097
It's nice.

22:19.847 --> 22:23.488
Let's see. It's got low mileage
and good safety features.

22:23.489 --> 22:24.856
I really appreciate this,

22:24.857 --> 22:27.900
but I just don't need a car.

22:27.900 --> 22:30.504
When I was your age,
I would have killed to have a car.

22:30.504 --> 22:33.189
Honey, we wanna do this for you.

22:34.466 --> 22:37.001
You're gonna save them
a bundle on the audio package.

22:44.743 --> 22:47.745
Looks like we're gonna
need some more garage.

22:48.158 --> 22:51.649
- Or a full-time valet.
- What the hell is this?

22:52.097 --> 22:54.647
Melody said you weren't in
school and now I know why.

22:54.885 --> 22:57.522
- John: It's a gift, Regina.
- Oh, this is going back.

22:57.523 --> 22:59.248
No, it's not going back.

22:59.248 --> 23:01.161
You knew about this and
you didn't say anything?

23:01.161 --> 23:02.473
It's not a secret.

23:02.473 --> 23:04.762
Raising someone else's child,
that's a secret. This is a gift.

23:04.763 --> 23:06.009
Regina: I should have known about this.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.252
John: Can we just calm down?

23:07.252 --> 23:09.653
Ok, the car stays. If you
don't like it, you can go.

23:09.653 --> 23:11.185
- Stop!
- If I go, she goes.

23:11.185 --> 23:12.010
- Please.
- That's so nice,

23:12.010 --> 23:13.162
threatening us on our daughters' birthday.

23:13.162 --> 23:13.955
You're making decisions for my daughter.

23:13.955 --> 23:15.677
I'll just take it back.

23:15.677 --> 23:18.199
You want her to ride on a motorcycle?

23:18.199 --> 23:19.824
My choice, my daughter.

23:39.532 --> 23:40.895
Daphne.

23:42.535 --> 23:44.125
Daph...

23:45.771 --> 23:48.885
- I just wanted to see how you're doing.
- I'm fine.

23:49.708 --> 23:51.258
Are you sure?

23:51.710 --> 23:53.360
I said I'm fine.

23:55.381 --> 23:56.416
Okay.

24:08.694 --> 24:11.362
Okay, now trust me.

24:11.363 --> 24:14.855
I know that she's in a bad place,

24:14.855 --> 24:18.636
but there's never gonna be a good time

24:18.637 --> 24:21.005
to tell her about us.

24:25.174 --> 24:27.208
I just wanna tell her

24:27.208 --> 24:30.500
before she stumbles across it herself.

24:30.500 --> 24:33.518
Because then it's gonna
look like we're hiding it,

24:33.519 --> 24:37.115
which we kind of are.

24:40.225 --> 24:41.257
Okay.

24:41.823 --> 24:42.865
Help me.

24:47.102 --> 24:50.435
Just I don't know how to deal
with her when she's like this.

24:50.436 --> 24:52.704
She apparently got her temper from me.

24:53.112 --> 24:54.672
I say just let her work through it.

24:54.673 --> 24:56.541
Well, okay, that's fine,

24:56.542 --> 24:58.011
but it just can't be like

24:58.011 --> 24:59.677
world war III around here anymore.

24:59.678 --> 25:02.480
Honey, it's not like
we fired the first shot.

25:02.481 --> 25:05.155
That's what my mother
said about the divorce.

25:06.279 --> 25:07.746
He started it.

25:08.604 --> 25:10.486
To the kids it doesn't matter,

25:11.071 --> 25:12.229
it's still war.

25:12.229 --> 25:13.843
Daphne wants to be here.

25:13.843 --> 25:15.985
What are we gonna do? Throw her out?

25:16.295 --> 25:18.115
Of course not.

25:18.397 --> 25:21.204
But we can't let her hide out here either.

25:27.506 --> 25:29.674
I wanna help her.

25:31.343 --> 25:33.911
But she doesn't need me right now.

25:35.381 --> 25:37.048
She needs her.

25:42.521 --> 25:45.823
I should have gotten
a partner in crime years ago.

25:59.063 --> 26:00.628
What are you doing?

26:36.408 --> 26:38.709
You're bleeding.

26:45.140 --> 26:46.870
I just wanted one thing

26:46.870 --> 26:50.688
that wasn't ruined by everyone else.

27:00.403 --> 27:03.087
- Hey! There she is!
- There's the birthday girl.

27:03.087 --> 27:04.292
Hey!

27:05.467 --> 27:07.412
I'm sorry about the whole...

27:07.412 --> 27:10.436
Stop right now. Cars are easy to fix.

27:10.436 --> 27:12.470
All I want you to worry about

27:12.471 --> 27:16.374
is having a happy birthday.

27:16.375 --> 27:17.506
That was really good.

27:17.506 --> 27:19.276
Thank you. Thank you.

27:19.884 --> 27:22.413
Hey, Daphne, I made some

27:22.414 --> 27:24.415
peanut-butter-chocolate-chip pancakes.

27:24.416 --> 27:26.551
They're Bay's favorite.

27:26.552 --> 27:28.769
We also have something for
you here on the table.

27:28.769 --> 27:30.256
It's kind of a Kennish family

27:30.256 --> 27:32.203
tradition because we do strive at all times

27:32.203 --> 27:34.539
to be as corny as possible.

27:36.113 --> 27:38.229
Do you want syrup or whipped cream?

27:38.230 --> 27:42.141
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:42.234 --> 27:44.711
I just don't like peanut butter.

27:45.607 --> 27:47.407
I'll make you blueberry.

27:48.170 --> 27:49.641
Oh wow!

27:49.642 --> 27:52.294
You guys are in full gear
this morning, aren't you?

27:52.381 --> 27:54.579
- Good morning.
- Happy birthday, honey.

27:54.580 --> 27:56.648
I made you your favorite pancakes.

27:56.649 --> 27:59.350
Thanks. I'm sorry.

27:59.351 --> 28:02.351
They still think that I'm five.

28:02.351 --> 28:04.254
Where's the smiling face?

28:05.324 --> 28:07.502
Honey, what happened to your hand?

28:08.514 --> 28:10.977
I had an unfortunate
incident with the rose bushes

28:10.977 --> 28:13.005
that I'd prefer not talk about actually.

28:13.005 --> 28:16.054
Okay, guys, I think we need
pictures of the birthday girls.

28:16.178 --> 28:18.350
- Yes!
- Dad, seriously.

28:18.350 --> 28:21.962
- We want Daphne to stay.
- That's fine.

28:22.099 --> 28:23.804
No, it's not. No matter what they say,

28:23.804 --> 28:25.776
you don't have to wear the hat.

28:25.849 --> 28:27.336
I think you have to wear the hat.

28:28.383 --> 28:31.334
- All right, ladies. There we go.
- Toby: Come on, cheese!

28:31.334 --> 28:32.434
Smile!

28:35.631 --> 28:36.939
John: Very nice!

29:21.102 --> 29:22.293
Hi.

29:23.527 --> 29:24.961
Thank you.

29:26.241 --> 29:27.618
Thanks.

29:29.483 --> 29:30.896
Thank you.

29:35.042 --> 29:37.025
Oh, it's nothing.

29:37.025 --> 29:39.663
It was just me being stupid.

29:46.546 --> 29:48.557
So I just got off the phone
with the auto body place,

29:48.557 --> 29:50.380
- and they quoted me $2,700.
- Ugh!

29:50.380 --> 29:52.959
- But I talked them down to two grand.
- How'd you do that?

29:52.960 --> 29:54.146
Same way I talked you into

29:54.147 --> 29:56.095
grounding me for one month instead of two.

29:56.096 --> 29:57.863
Good man.

29:57.864 --> 30:00.833
So does this mean I get
to keep the extra $700?

30:01.783 --> 30:03.202
Don't push it.

30:50.050 --> 30:52.551
What were you guys talking about?

30:54.187 --> 30:56.422
No, seriously, tell me.

30:58.545 --> 31:03.162
She doesn't like me, does she?

31:06.699 --> 31:07.667
Will?

31:09.884 --> 31:11.821
As in she doesn't now.

31:14.790 --> 31:19.376
- Okay, here it is. The other one.
- John: Wow!

31:19.625 --> 31:22.472
Wow! That looks fantastic.
Just have to light 'em.

31:22.472 --> 31:24.660
Here. I can help you with that.

31:24.660 --> 31:25.982
Thank you.

31:37.799 --> 31:41.403
I never missed any of Daphne's birthdays,

31:42.278 --> 31:44.055
and I am not gonna miss

31:44.055 --> 31:45.746
any more of Bay's.

31:51.180 --> 31:52.954
I'm not okay with this.

31:55.533 --> 31:57.896
- Honey.
- I'm sorry.

31:58.919 --> 31:59.974
Dad.

32:01.727 --> 32:03.537
I want her here.

32:06.737 --> 32:07.747
Okay.

32:13.141 --> 32:14.246
Come here.

32:16.090 --> 32:17.348
Thank you.

32:47.058 --> 32:49.192
The cake is delicious.

32:49.713 --> 32:50.924
Thank you.

32:52.096 --> 32:55.017
The trick is to not be shy with the butter.

32:59.103 --> 33:02.005
You know what would lighten
the mood? Presents.

33:02.006 --> 33:03.429
Yeah.

33:03.908 --> 33:05.427
I-I...

33:05.427 --> 33:07.837
I just wanted to say something.

33:09.413 --> 33:13.593
16 years ago, I gave birth

33:13.593 --> 33:16.429
to a beautiful little girl.

33:18.275 --> 33:20.001
And I brought home

33:20.286 --> 33:23.854
another beautiful little girl.

33:26.063 --> 33:29.373
And even though it's hard right now

33:29.373 --> 33:31.760
to make peace

33:31.760 --> 33:33.394
with everything

33:33.570 --> 33:35.016
that's happened.

33:36.547 --> 33:38.191
Tonight,

33:38.412 --> 33:41.663
I feel very lucky

33:42.398 --> 33:44.183
to have two

33:44.359 --> 33:46.238
incredible

33:47.002 --> 33:48.550
daughters.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.889
And all of the people

33:55.092 --> 33:56.937
that come with them.

33:59.281 --> 34:02.730
- So happy birthday, baby.
- John: Happy birthday, girls.

34:02.939 --> 34:07.082
- Toby: Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, sweetie.

34:08.038 --> 34:10.556
- Presents. Presents.
- Yeah!

34:19.655 --> 34:21.148
"From Emmett."

34:33.030 --> 34:35.398
It's a scarf.

34:37.101 --> 34:39.335
Thank you.

34:41.443 --> 34:43.197
Daphne, your turn.

34:55.152 --> 34:56.973
Oh no, you didn't!

34:58.488 --> 35:01.372
You did! You did! I can't believe it.

35:04.096 --> 35:06.922
And you got Charles Dane to autograph it.

35:08.411 --> 35:10.094
What's "Deafenstein"?

35:10.094 --> 35:12.694
It's an all-deaf version of "Frankenstein"

35:12.694 --> 35:14.481
done all in A.S.L.

35:15.105 --> 35:16.973
"Deafenstein."

35:16.974 --> 35:19.475
"He can't hear you scream."

35:20.105 --> 35:21.618
This looks terrible.

35:22.691 --> 35:24.437
It's so bad,

35:24.437 --> 35:26.654
and the sequels are even worse.

35:27.934 --> 35:30.476
- What's that?
- She said we're obsessed.

35:31.366 --> 35:34.259
How did you get Charles
Dane to autograph it?

35:34.482 --> 35:37.095
He was at a horror
convention in Springfield.

35:37.345 --> 35:39.728
That's like 150 miles away.

35:40.173 --> 35:42.175
"Remember six months ago when I told you"

35:42.176 --> 35:44.325
"I couldn't go to your basketball game"

35:44.325 --> 35:45.575
"'cause I was writing a paper?"

35:45.575 --> 35:47.628
"That's when I did it."

35:50.242 --> 35:53.428
That's a very thoughtful gift.

36:06.913 --> 36:08.605
Oh hey.

36:10.572 --> 36:14.717
Thanks again for the scarf.

36:21.249 --> 36:24.470
It's not a scarf.

36:28.605 --> 36:31.497
It's a blindfold? It's a blindfold.

37:04.516 --> 37:07.211
My art! How...

37:08.638 --> 37:10.916
You did that?

37:11.999 --> 37:14.767
It's perfect!

37:23.010 --> 37:25.578
This is badass.

37:40.255 --> 37:41.619
It's okay.

37:42.937 --> 37:44.180
Maybe it's better

37:44.180 --> 37:46.455
coming from me.

38:10.024 --> 38:11.624
Can I come in?

38:25.874 --> 38:27.525
I didn't wanna give you this

38:27.901 --> 38:29.592
in front of everybody.

38:40.825 --> 38:43.386
It's all your favorite recipes

38:43.386 --> 38:46.419
and favorite takeout menus

38:46.798 --> 38:50.236
and a couple of cereal box tops.

38:55.026 --> 38:56.887
Are you kidding?

38:57.342 --> 39:00.967
This is seriously
the worst present on earth.

39:01.290 --> 39:04.275
Cereal box tops and takeout menus?

39:04.275 --> 39:06.380
This sucks!

39:08.547 --> 39:12.170
I'm terrible at birthday presents, aren't I?

39:12.170 --> 39:15.740
No wonder you didn't want to give
it to me in front of everybody.

39:23.067 --> 39:26.336
So I've been thinking about this car.

39:27.575 --> 39:31.408
And I think you should keep it.

39:31.957 --> 39:34.878
It's a nice, safe,

39:34.879 --> 39:38.392
moderately-priced- for-them car.

39:38.569 --> 39:39.887
And...

39:40.981 --> 39:42.346
you deserve it.

39:46.628 --> 39:47.990
Thank you.

39:52.730 --> 39:54.366
I miss you.

39:54.901 --> 39:56.669
I keep wanting to forgive you

39:56.669 --> 39:59.353
and make everything how it was before,

39:59.353 --> 40:03.379
but you kept this huge thing from me

40:03.379 --> 40:05.909
and every time I think about it,

40:05.910 --> 40:09.212
I just get mad all over again.

40:11.649 --> 40:15.118
I guess I'm just stubborn.

40:17.855 --> 40:20.891
Of course you are.

40:20.892 --> 40:23.242
You're my daughter.

41:04.938 --> 41:07.387
Don't you think you could go
a little easier on her, dad?

41:07.839 --> 41:09.644
You're not a parent, buddy.

41:10.742 --> 41:11.905
You can't understand.

41:12.497 --> 41:13.939
People screw up.

41:14.846 --> 41:16.462
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

41:16.814 --> 41:19.083
Got scared and did the wrong thing?

41:21.341 --> 41:23.125
It's not the same.

41:56.519 --> 41:57.687
I just wanted to make sure

41:57.687 --> 41:59.944
you made it through the day in one piece.

42:01.098 --> 42:02.279
Thanks.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.164
Weird day, huh?

42:04.259 --> 42:05.333
Yeah.

42:08.900 --> 42:09.941
What's up?

42:10.251 --> 42:12.730
It's just that I always thought

42:12.730 --> 42:15.612
my mom would be the one constant in my life.

42:15.612 --> 42:17.534
The one person I could always rely on,

42:17.534 --> 42:20.435
but I was wrong.

42:21.276 --> 42:23.941
I know. It sucks.

42:24.302 --> 42:27.747
No, there is one person

42:27.747 --> 42:30.252
who's always been there for me.

42:30.799 --> 42:33.469
I just can't believe
I never saw it before now.

42:34.216 --> 42:36.134
Who are you talking about?

42:40.513 --> 42:41.789
Emmett.

42:44.886 --> 42:46.945
Are you saying you're into him?

42:50.450 --> 42:53.338
Yeah, I think I am.

42:58.883 --> 43:02.173
- What?
- Nothing.

43:03.306 --> 43:04.732
Just...

43:05.189 --> 43:07.232
Happy birthday.

43:07.859 --> 43:09.176
And you too.
