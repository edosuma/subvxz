16:02.583 --> 16:04.916
-Is that what I think it is?
-Yeah.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.208
-Yeah. It's not mine. It's--
-Well, let's hope.

16:08.291 --> 16:10.375
Yeah. It's-- Some Klansmen
are over,

16:10.458 --> 16:11.708
and I spilled coffee on it.

16:11.791 --> 16:13.875
It's my responsibility,
and I feel like, you know,

16:13.958 --> 16:16.208
-I spill, I clean.
-So if it's your responsibility,

16:16.291 --> 16:18.583
then it's your responsibility
to take it somewhere else

16:18.666 --> 16:20.375
because I don't want it
in my store,

16:20.458 --> 16:22.166
I don't wanna clean it,
I don't wanna touch it.

16:22.250 --> 16:23.708
I get the reluctance, I do.

16:23.791 --> 16:25.833
But let me just say this,
as far as Klansmen go,

16:25.916 --> 16:28.375
he's a decent Klansman,
yeah.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.166
-A decent Klansman...
-Yeah.

16:30.250 --> 16:33.041
-...is a Klansman.
-True. True.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.166
But, you see
what you're doing here?

16:35.250 --> 16:37.333
What you're doing
is what they're doing.

16:37.416 --> 16:38.666
You don't wanna have
anything to do

16:38.750 --> 16:41.083
with this particular group,
that's their mantra.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.750
And now
that's what you're doing.

16:42.833 --> 16:44.458
-This group hates me.
-Yeah.

16:44.541 --> 16:46.083
-I'm a Jew. They hate me.
-I understand.

16:46.166 --> 16:47.208
-See this cheek?
-Mm-hmm.

16:47.291 --> 16:49.000
All right. Look. See?
See what I'm doing?

16:49.083 --> 16:51.250
I'm turning that cheek.
Turn the cheek!

16:51.333 --> 16:53.875
Turn your cheek!
Let's not be like them.

16:53.958 --> 16:56.375
Let's show them
that we're different.

16:56.458 --> 16:57.958
We don't discriminate.

16:58.041 --> 17:00.291
-Okay.
-Thank you. Thank you.

17:00.375 --> 17:02.125
I really don't like this,
but I'll do it.

17:02.208 --> 17:04.000
I really appreciate that.

17:04.083 --> 17:07.666
And, um, is there any way
I could get this robe, uh,

17:07.750 --> 17:09.875
by tomorrow, he's got
big rallies coming up

17:09.958 --> 17:11.541
in Santa Fe and Tucson.

17:11.625 --> 17:14.291
-Three o' clock, tomorrow.
-By the way, you know anyone

17:14.375 --> 17:16.875
who... owns a cow?

17:16.958 --> 17:18.875
We're in the middle of the city,
there's no cows.

17:18.958 --> 17:22.000
If someone comes in
and they look a little farm-ish,

17:22.083 --> 17:23.458
if you have
a farm-ish customer...

17:23.541 --> 17:25.958
Yeah, I don't think that happens
too often, but okay.

17:26.041 --> 17:28.125
Thank you so much.
Really appreciate it.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.083
Uh, you know what?
I don't have any change.

17:30.166 --> 17:31.250
You know, it takes bills.

17:31.333 --> 17:33.708
LARRY: Yeah, it's hard to stuff
them in there.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.125
It's very narrow, I see.

17:35.208 --> 17:36.833
-Not that hard.
-LARRY: By the way,

17:36.916 --> 17:38.125

17:38.208 --> 17:39.583
(CLICKS TONGUE)
See you tomorrow.

17:40.416 --> 17:42.083
Absolutely disgusting.

17:44.375 --> 17:47.916
The blowing of the shofar
symbolizes many things.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.833
In the Torah, it is said
the blowing of the shofar

17:50.916 --> 17:52.916
is a call to assemble
for battle.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.041
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:54.125 --> 17:55.500
It's a High Holy Day miracle,

17:55.583 --> 17:57.125
-look who's here.
-(LAUGHS) Yeah.

17:57.208 --> 18:00.125
...intolerance and hate
that are amassing right here

18:00.208 --> 18:01.625
in our very city.

18:01.708 --> 18:04.458
A mere few blocks away,
people are gathering

18:04.541 --> 18:08.500
to spread their lies
and disinformation and venom.

18:08.583 --> 18:10.416
Can you believe this, there's
a hate group in Westwood?

18:10.500 --> 18:12.958
Yeah. I ran into one,
I spilled coffee on his robe,

18:13.041 --> 18:14.583
I had to bring it
to the dry cleaner.

18:14.666 --> 18:16.166
You had a confrontation
with the hate group?

18:16.250 --> 18:17.500
-Yes.
-What kind of robe was it,

18:17.583 --> 18:19.875
-like a big, white robe?
-First of all, it's not white.

18:19.958 --> 18:21.625
It's more like bone or ecru.

18:21.708 --> 18:24.041
Huh! How was the eye doctor?
You see Heidi?

18:24.125 --> 18:26.583
-Yes. She's a great doctor.
-Great doctor.

18:26.666 --> 18:27.791
God.

18:27.875 --> 18:30.416
-Charming. Really attractive.
-Yeah, thank you.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.333
I knew you would be happy when
you saw her, she's terrific.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.791
However, there's something
I have to tell you.

18:35.875 --> 18:36.833
Okay.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.875
It's difficult for me
to even bring this up.

18:38.958 --> 18:41.666
-Bring what up?
-When the exam was over,

18:41.750 --> 18:44.375
she dropped a Pirate's Booty
on the floor.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.500
Didn't pick it up.

18:48.583 --> 18:50.250
Did you see her drop
the Pirate's Booty?

18:50.333 --> 18:53.916
I saw her do it. I saw her look
at the Pirate's Booty,

18:54.000 --> 18:55.791
make the decision
not to pick it up

18:55.875 --> 18:57.041
and walk out of the room.

18:57.125 --> 18:58.875
Maybe she got it later.
She could've been embarrassed.

18:58.958 --> 19:00.166
No, she didn't.

19:00.250 --> 19:01.458
-You know why?
-Why?

19:01.541 --> 19:02.791
'Cause I picked it up.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.500
Yeah. I don't like
what that says about her.

19:05.583 --> 19:06.583
No, I don't like it.

19:06.666 --> 19:09.166
It's indicative
of a moral compass gone askew.

19:09.250 --> 19:10.708
That's terrible.

19:10.791 --> 19:12.083
I know, it's awful.

19:12.166 --> 19:14.291
What do I do? I can't just sit
with this, it bothers me now.

19:14.375 --> 19:15.375
I don't know what you should do.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.000
Maybe you could bring it up
with her.

19:17.083 --> 19:18.458
Keep me out of it. Could never--

19:23.291 --> 19:24.541
It's not a good thing
to drop the booty

19:24.625 --> 19:25.625

-Not good.

-It's not a good snack.

do you?

I'm gonna have a potato chip.

24:06.875 --> 24:10.291
My friend's wife
is a seamstress.

24:10.375 --> 24:12.833
You can't believe the stuff
that she can sew.

24:12.916 --> 24:14.833
-Yeah?
-She kind of owes me a favor.

24:14.916 --> 24:18.791
Still, it's not gonna be
an easy ask, but...

24:18.875 --> 24:20.583
I think I can get her to do it.

24:20.666 --> 24:23.375
-Like a custom job?
-A custom job.

24:23.458 --> 24:24.541
You think she can get it done.

24:24.625 --> 24:26.458
She can get it done.
She can get it done, yeah.

24:26.541 --> 24:27.875
I've never had
a custom one done.

24:27.958 --> 24:31.458
She could do it. You will be
the envy of every Klansman!

24:31.541 --> 24:33.541
-(LAUGHS)
-Huh, you like that?

24:33.625 --> 24:34.750
They'll look at you, they'll go,

24:34.833 --> 24:36.041
"Hey, what, did you see
Joe's robe?

24:36.125 --> 24:38.000
Look at Joe's robe,
where do I get one of those?"

24:38.083 --> 24:41.041
You'll get invited to the
Grand Wizard's house for dinner.

24:41.125 --> 24:42.291
That's my prediction.

24:42.375 --> 24:44.083
I've never been to his house.
If I could go to dinner,

24:44.166 --> 24:47.333
I'd say that comes out
to be a pretty fair trade.

24:47.416 --> 24:49.416
-Yeah.
-Great, great.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.166
(COW MOOS)

24:51.791 --> 24:53.500
That'd be awesome, man.

25:01.416 --> 25:04.625
Maybe you could do me
a small favor.

25:06.625 --> 25:08.083
Anyway, I hope
I'm not disturbing you.

25:08.166 --> 25:10.250
No, I'm just making dinner.
You know, the usual.

25:10.333 --> 25:12.458
You know, I'm not one
for pop-ins, you know.

25:12.541 --> 25:15.541
-You pop in all the time.
-Eh? You know.

25:15.625 --> 25:17.125
By the way,
I cannot stop thinking

25:17.208 --> 25:19.208
-about that banner.
-Uh, yeah.

25:19.291 --> 25:21.833
That was an incredible
work of art.

25:21.916 --> 25:23.875
That makes me so happy
that you appreciate it.

25:23.958 --> 25:26.833
How could I not? I wouldn't be
a human being, for God's sake!

25:26.916 --> 25:28.583
With all due modesty,
it's a masterpiece,

25:28.666 --> 25:29.708
I mean, it's amazing.

25:29.791 --> 25:31.208
If I had a talent like that,
I'd be shouting it

25:31.291 --> 25:33.500
from the rooftops,
"Hey, look at me everybody."

25:33.583 --> 25:35.250
You have that need.
I'm more secure.

25:35.333 --> 25:36.208
Yeah.

25:36.291 --> 25:37.708
Thanks again for golfing
with the rabbi.

25:37.791 --> 25:40.625
Oh, what a delightful man.

25:40.708 --> 25:42.208
I knew you would like him.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.750
-And fun to play with.
-Fun.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.458
Sense of humor,
just like you said.

25:45.541 --> 25:47.125
-Right.
-And hip, whoo!

25:47.208 --> 25:49.708
-Yeah.
-Those four and a half hours

25:49.791 --> 25:51.125
just flew by.

25:51.208 --> 25:53.666
Anyway, I was thinking
maybe you could sew

25:53.750 --> 25:55.416
something for me.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.166
Uh, I'm so touched.

25:57.250 --> 25:58.458
You'll do it?

25:58.541 --> 26:00.375
Well, depends on what it is,
I am not capable of everything.

26:00.458 --> 26:02.083
I don't think it's that
difficult.

26:02.166 --> 26:03.583
I think you could
knock it off...

26:03.666 --> 26:04.625
You have something in mind?

26:04.708 --> 26:06.041
-Yeah, yes, I do, actually.
-What is it?

26:06.125 --> 26:07.500
It's not for me.
It's for a friend of mine.

26:07.583 --> 26:09.083
-What is it?
-It's kind of a robe.

26:09.166 --> 26:10.833
What kind of a robe,
like a bathrobe?

26:10.916 --> 26:12.625
No, more like a sheet-y
kind of thing.

26:12.708 --> 26:14.583
Sheet, like a kaftan,
kind of a...

26:14.666 --> 26:16.750
-It's kaftan-ish, yeah.
-Uh-huh.

26:16.833 --> 26:19.583
-There's a hood and--
-Is it for a man or a woman?

26:19.666 --> 26:21.875
-Oh, it's for a man.
-What kind of a man?

26:21.958 --> 26:24.916
-A Klansman.
-What do you mean, a Klansman?

26:25.041 --> 26:26.708
Yeah, a Ku Klux Klansman.

26:26.791 --> 26:28.000
-What?
-Yeah.

26:28.083 --> 26:29.458
What are you, fucking crazy?

26:29.541 --> 26:31.500
I could see how
you would react like that, okay?

26:31.583 --> 26:33.083
How do you even know a Klansman?

26:33.166 --> 26:35.416
I spilled coffee on his robe,
you know, I feel like

26:35.500 --> 26:37.500
it's my responsibility
to replace the robe.

26:37.583 --> 26:38.958
The dry cleaner said he lost it.

26:39.041 --> 26:41.333
Larry, it goes against
everything I believe in.

26:41.416 --> 26:43.166
Next thing you're gonna do
is tell me some of them

26:43.250 --> 26:44.500
are very good people.

26:44.583 --> 26:46.500
I did play golf with the rabbi.

26:46.583 --> 26:49.291
He was the slowest player
I've ever been with.

26:49.375 --> 26:50.916
You do owe me a favor.

26:56.166 --> 26:57.625
(SIGHS) I'll do it.

26:57.708 --> 26:59.750
-Thank you so much.
-Just go. Just go.

26:59.833 --> 27:01.750
And by the way,
don't worry about the pointy hat

27:01.833 --> 27:04.000
because that didn't get
coffee on it.

27:04.083 --> 27:06.000
-Oh, some good things.
-Yeah. Also,

27:06.083 --> 27:07.458
don't make the sleeves
too floppy

27:07.541 --> 27:10.041
because they can get burned
when he's lighting the torches.

27:11.833 --> 27:13.708
I'm sorry you weren't here
the other night.

27:13.791 --> 27:16.291
We had a fabulous square dance.

27:16.375 --> 27:18.541
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, right in the barn.

27:18.625 --> 27:19.750
-You square...
-Yeah.

27:19.833 --> 27:21.583
I'm picturing you
square dancing.

27:21.666 --> 27:22.958
Oh, yeah, yeah!
Grab your partner,

27:23.041 --> 27:25.708
do-si-do, oh, yeah.
I do-si, yeah.

27:25.791 --> 27:28.208
(HUMMING)

27:28.291 --> 27:30.041
Oh, hey, hey, look at this.

27:30.125 --> 27:31.750
-Look at Jessie.
-Oh.

27:31.833 --> 27:34.000
I'd like you to meet
my friend, Woody.

27:34.083 --> 27:35.458
-Jessie.
-Huh?

27:35.541 --> 27:37.250
You're a beautiful mother.

27:37.333 --> 27:39.375
-She's my baby.
-Oh, yeah.

27:39.458 --> 27:41.166
Do you ever milk her?

27:41.250 --> 27:43.333
Joe. Do I milk?

27:43.416 --> 27:45.875
-Joe, tell him about my...
-Larry milk.

27:45.958 --> 27:46.916
-Huh?
-He milk.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.375
-Oh, yeah, I milk.
-I mean, she looks like

27:48.458 --> 27:51.375
she's ready to pop. Let's pull
up a stool and get it going.

27:51.458 --> 27:57.416
Uh, it's a great idea,
but I milked so much last week.

27:57.500 --> 27:59.708
I got milky fingers,
you know what that is?

27:59.791 --> 28:00.916
I never heard of that.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.750
It's a farm term,
it means when you milk too much

28:02.833 --> 28:06.041
and your fingers get very stiff
and you can't close them up.

28:06.125 --> 28:08.416
WOODY: And what about the calf?
What's the calf's name?

28:08.500 --> 28:12.416
The calf? Oh, yeah,
that's, uh, that's Rebecca.

28:12.500 --> 28:15.833
Oh, it's very, uh,
gendery-bendery of you

28:15.916 --> 28:18.458
to have a male calf
with a female name.

28:18.541 --> 28:21.958
You know, uh, we don't see
gender here on this farm.

28:22.041 --> 28:23.208
We're kind of a woke farm.

28:23.291 --> 28:25.708
We're the most progressive
farm in the valley, Woody.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.000
-Are you?
-Oh, yeah.

28:27.083 --> 28:29.875
You know, Joe here, uh,
he's got the pictures

28:29.958 --> 28:32.375
of Nancy Pelosi on his tractor.

28:32.458 --> 28:35.041
(LAUGHS)

28:36.541 --> 28:38.583
-It's funny. Yeah.
-Yeah.

28:38.666 --> 28:40.166
So anyway, you know,
we should, uh,

28:40.250 --> 28:42.125
we should probably take off.
I could--

28:42.208 --> 28:43.708
If you want some of those apples
back there,

28:43.791 --> 28:46.416
Joe can rustle you up a bunch
if you want, to take home.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.458
Right, I won't let the Jew
charge you.

28:48.541 --> 28:50.458
-Oh.
-(LAUGHS)

28:50.541 --> 28:53.083
We harass each other
all the time, yeah.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.375
Well, what do you call him?

28:54.458 --> 28:56.333
I just call him
a racist cocksucker.

28:56.416 --> 28:59.833
(LAUGHTER)

28:59.916 --> 29:02.708
-It's good stuff.
-It works. It works.

29:02.791 --> 29:03.833
It's life on the ranch.

29:03.916 --> 29:04.875
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

29:04.958 --> 29:07.250
Wow. What an honor to meet you.

29:07.333 --> 29:09.916
-Bye Jessie, yeah.
-You gonna pet her goodbye?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I gotta have lunch in a minute.

29:21.750 --> 29:23.000
You okay?

29:23.083 --> 29:25.375
Yeah, I'm great. Great.

29:25.458 --> 29:26.833
Freddy.

29:26.916 --> 29:30.583
Okay. What's wrong? What?
What's going on?

29:30.666 --> 29:32.625
Now that you've mentioned
something,

29:32.708 --> 29:35.125
someone that we both know...

29:35.208 --> 29:36.833
-Mm-hmm.
-...was in your office.

29:36.916 --> 29:38.041
Okay.

29:38.125 --> 29:40.458
And said that you were, um,
eating some Pirate Booty.

29:40.541 --> 29:42.583
And that the Pirate Booty
fell on the ground.

29:42.666 --> 29:44.750
And that you made a decision
not to pick the Pirate Booty

29:44.833 --> 29:47.458
up off the floor,
and it's been bothering me.

29:47.541 --> 29:49.541
-Is this a joke?
-It's a simple question.

29:49.625 --> 29:51.083
Did you drop the Pirate Booty
or did you not?

29:51.166 --> 29:54.708
No, but who would tell you
something so insane?

29:54.791 --> 29:56.666
-The who's not important.
-It's very important.

29:56.750 --> 29:58.375
-What? It was a dog walker...
-Freddy, who?

29:58.458 --> 30:00.250
It was a mutual friend.
What does it matter?

30:00.333 --> 30:01.666
-It was Larry David.
-Oh, for fuck's sake.

30:01.750 --> 30:03.416
Okay? He said to me
that he saw you in the office

30:03.500 --> 30:04.541
-you were eating--
-Larry David,

30:04.625 --> 30:05.916
he couldn't choose
between one and two.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.708
-Why is this about...
-One or two.

30:07.791 --> 30:08.875
Did you drop the Pirate Booty?

30:08.958 --> 30:11.458
-He is magoo.
-But what's his motivation?

30:11.541 --> 30:12.541
What would he gain from it?

30:12.625 --> 30:14.125
Freddy, don't you think
if I notice something

30:14.208 --> 30:15.625
that fell on the ground,
I would pick it up?

30:15.708 --> 30:17.125
-It's ridiculous.
-Yeah, one would hope.

30:17.208 --> 30:18.416
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

30:18.500 --> 30:19.416
-That's it.
-Freddy?

30:19.500 --> 30:21.208
-Did you drop the Pirate Booty?
-Yes.

30:21.958 --> 30:23.000
-Okay.
-Yes.

30:23.083 --> 30:25.041
I dropped the fucking
Pirate's Booty, okay.

30:25.125 --> 30:26.875
Wasn't a big deal,
we have a team of people.

30:26.958 --> 30:27.833
I was busy.

30:27.916 --> 30:29.041
This is where
we should've started.

30:29.125 --> 30:30.291
Didn't care then,
don't care now.

30:30.375 --> 30:31.583
Yeah, and you know what?

30:31.666 --> 30:33.166
-Didn't wanna pick it up.
-Look what you put me through.

30:33.250 --> 30:35.333
-Wait, I put you through?
-Yeah.

30:35.416 --> 30:36.750
This is all fucking Larry David.

30:36.833 --> 30:38.416
No, it's not.
Thank God for Larry David

30:38.500 --> 30:39.625
because you'll grow from this.

30:39.708 --> 30:41.416
Ew, you know what,
I'm growing now.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.875
I'm outta here. Oh, God.

30:43.958 --> 30:46.125
And you know what?
You know what?

30:46.208 --> 30:48.625
That's not gonna solve anything.
That's not gonna solve anything.

30:48.708 --> 30:50.375
This is how you handle--
Okay, all right.

30:50.458 --> 30:53.250
I see it now. I don't know
how I didn't see it before.

30:53.333 --> 30:54.750
I hope someone can pick that up.

30:54.833 --> 30:57.166
By the way, super great way
of handling this.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.375
-How about that?
-Uh, fantastic.

31:01.458 --> 31:03.166
-Right?
-Thank you so much.

31:03.250 --> 31:06.375
-The grapes, the apples.
-Of course, of course.

31:06.458 --> 31:09.250
And I'm looking forward
to talking about Uncle Mo.

31:09.333 --> 31:12.083
That's very exciting.
Thank you.

31:12.166 --> 31:14.250
You got it made out here,
you know.

31:14.333 --> 31:16.041
JOE: It's a pleasure there,
Woody.

31:16.125 --> 31:17.541
-Thank you, Joe.
-Yeah.

31:17.625 --> 31:18.833
You take care of yourself, man.

31:18.916 --> 31:21.791
-Yeah, you too, man.
-Thank you, sir. Oops.

31:21.875 --> 31:24.291
Good man. These are good.
I'll see you guys.

31:24.375 --> 31:26.541
Hey, what-- Whoa.
What the fuck?

31:26.625 --> 31:27.541
What?

31:27.625 --> 31:29.000
Aren't you gonna pick up
the grape?

31:30.958 --> 31:32.791
It's just-- Well, no, no.

31:32.875 --> 31:35.041
Yeah, but I wouldn't drop
a grape on your porch

31:35.125 --> 31:37.250
-and then walk off.
-It's just a grape.

31:37.333 --> 31:38.458
It doesn't matter.

31:38.541 --> 31:42.041
Fucking Hollywood leftist
bullshit is what you are.

31:42.125 --> 31:44.250
Hollywood left-- Larry. Come on.

31:44.333 --> 31:47.750
-Eh... Should pick up the grape.
-That's not cool.

31:47.833 --> 31:51.083
It looks like it is a sense
of entitlement there.

31:51.166 --> 31:52.416
It's gonna biodegrade, Larry.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.375
Pick up the fucking grape,
Woody!

31:55.416 --> 31:57.291
Sure, I'll pick up the grape,
Joe.

31:57.375 --> 31:58.416
Here, here's your grape.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.000
Fuck you
with your fucking grape!

32:01.083 --> 32:03.791
And there's a whole
fucking fistful of grapes.

32:03.875 --> 32:06.250
And guess what?
Here's a fucking apple.

32:06.333 --> 32:08.333
-Don't you fucking do it.

Stay right there, boy.

32:19.208 --> 32:22.083
-Where's he going?
-I think he's getting a gun.

32:23.458 --> 32:25.375
Teddy was right
about you, Larry.

32:25.458 --> 32:28.500
Ted Danson? What did he say?

32:28.583 --> 32:30.500
You should've picked up
the grape!

32:30.583 --> 32:32.500
I'm not seeing well
out of the lenses, you know.

32:32.583 --> 32:33.875
I just made bad decisions.

32:33.958 --> 32:35.625
I took two,
I should've taken one.

32:35.708 --> 32:37.375
And I took three
and I should've taken four.

32:37.458 --> 32:39.750

always wrong decisions.

32:39.833 --> 32:42.250
-I'm plagued with them.
-Sir, we'll get you
a new prescription.

32:42.333 --> 32:44.625
I just need to dilate
your pupils.

32:44.708 --> 32:46.958
This might feel a little cold.
Okay.

32:47.041 --> 32:49.333
Your eyes are gonna be
a little sensitive to light

32:49.416 --> 32:52.375
for the next 30 minutes,
so stay out of direct sunlight.

32:52.458 --> 32:53.541
I'll take it from here.

32:53.625 --> 32:55.458
-I'm definitely prepared for it.
-Thank you so much.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.000
-I'm gonna do one.
-Thank you.

32:57.083 --> 32:59.000
I'm gonna do one,
and I'm gonna do...

32:59.083 --> 33:00.208
What the fuck, Larry?

33:00.291 --> 33:02.541
Why would you go and tell Freddy
I dropped a stupid

33:02.625 --> 33:05.041
fucking Pirate's Booty
on the floor? Are you nuts?

33:05.125 --> 33:06.083
Why didn't you pick it up?

33:06.166 --> 33:07.625
Why do you fucking care
if I picked it up?

33:07.708 --> 33:09.958
It's not that I care. There's
a sense of entitlement there

33:10.041 --> 33:11.416
-that I thought was wrong...
-What?

33:11.500 --> 33:13.291
...and I needed to let my friend
know about that.

33:13.375 --> 33:15.000
Larry, I was gonna pick it up,
okay?

33:15.083 --> 33:16.333
Oh, you were going
to pick it up?

33:16.416 --> 33:17.375
I was going to pick it up.

33:17.458 --> 33:18.583
I don't think you were going
to pick it up.

33:18.666 --> 33:19.750
How do you know
and why do you care?

33:19.833 --> 33:21.125
You know why?
Because I picked it up.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.833
No one asked you
to clean it up, Larry.

33:22.916 --> 33:24.083
You know what you could've done?

33:24.166 --> 33:25.708
Hey, I have an idea.
You could've done nothing.

33:25.791 --> 33:27.583
You think I can leave
a Pirate's Booty on the floor?

33:27.666 --> 33:29.041
-No.
-No one fucking cares

33:29.125 --> 33:30.208
about the Pirate's Booty, Larry.

33:30.291 --> 33:31.500
I care about the Pirate's Booty.

33:31.583 --> 33:34.208

It's time for your eye exam.
