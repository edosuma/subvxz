WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.046
[Betty] Previously
onRiverdale...

00:03.090 --> 00:05.483
Now that the doll's back,
the spirit of Julian

00:05.527 --> 00:07.355
is haunting Thistlehouse?

00:07.398 --> 00:09.270
What other explanation
could there possibly be?

00:09.313 --> 00:10.836
These kids, they're good kids.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.403
Reg, we're thinking
maybe the Bulldogs

00:12.447 --> 00:13.665
could be like
big brothers to them.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.276
Did you happen to know
my grandfather?

00:15.319 --> 00:18.018
[Francis] Your grandfather
was an excellent writer.

00:18.061 --> 00:21.064
[Betty] We don't actually
know anything about Charles.

00:21.108 --> 00:24.589
I'm interested in,
"Is he a serial killer or not?"

00:24.633 --> 00:27.201
You see,
our father needed help,

00:27.244 --> 00:28.941
"Our father?"

00:28.985 --> 00:30.508
Leave town

00:30.552 --> 00:32.293
or the next time we meet,

00:32.336 --> 00:33.555
you won't be driving away.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.035
You won't even be walking.

00:35.557 --> 00:36.645
[gun cocking]

00:37.515 --> 00:39.039
You're a dead man,
you hear me?

00:40.388 --> 00:42.129
You're a dead man walking!

00:44.131 --> 00:46.046
[Jughead] This is
what happens in Riverdale.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.221
Once the sun sets,

00:47.264 --> 00:49.527
Dodger's minions go to work.

00:49.571 --> 00:51.355
He recruits
hungry and homeless kids,

00:51.399 --> 00:55.055
so that if they're arrested,
they do some time in juvie,

00:55.098 --> 00:57.100
but then, they're back
on the streets...

01:01.626 --> 01:03.846
...working for Dodger again.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.196
They're chewed up
by the system.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.155
[metal clanking]

01:08.198 --> 01:09.765
Except that recently,

01:09.808 --> 01:12.811
someone's thrown
a tire iron into the system.

01:16.163 --> 01:17.903
You'll thank me someday.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.601
[muffled] Let me go.
Come on, man.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.691
[Jughead] Usually,
Dodger or the police

01:22.734 --> 01:26.086
would go to the kid next, but tonight's his lucky night.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.787
Instead of getting sucked
back into the system

01:31.830 --> 01:33.180
then spat out again...

01:35.051 --> 01:36.574
...these kids,

01:36.618 --> 01:38.272
they've got someone
looking out for 'em now.

01:41.057 --> 01:42.885
People that ask themselves,

01:43.451 --> 01:45.148
"How do you save a town?"

01:46.323 --> 01:47.716
And who know the answer...

01:47.759 --> 01:49.021
Welcome to the team.

01:51.328 --> 01:52.895
..."One kid at a time."

01:56.420 --> 01:57.813
For every kid saved,

01:57.856 --> 02:00.598
there was one less
hustling for Dodger,

02:00.642 --> 02:03.471
and that would not do at all.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.560
[instrumental music plays]

02:10.608 --> 02:11.740
[engine starts]

02:13.220 --> 02:15.918
[Jughead] Meanwhile,
in existential hell,

02:15.961 --> 02:17.746
I was facing the tyranny
of a blank page.

02:17.789 --> 02:18.747
[dial pad beeps]

02:18.790 --> 02:19.835
I need my anchor.

02:19.878 --> 02:21.663
[cell phone dialing]

02:21.706 --> 02:23.186
Hey, I didn't wake you, did I?

02:24.448 --> 02:25.493
[bell dinging]

02:25.536 --> 02:27.059
-Hi.
-Hey.

02:27.103 --> 02:28.365
Are you okay?

02:28.409 --> 02:30.628
Yeah, I just can't write.

02:31.629 --> 02:34.066
Mr. Chipping gave the class
this assignment

02:34.110 --> 02:35.590
where we're supposed to write
our own version

02:35.633 --> 02:36.939
of a Baxter Brothers novel,

02:36.982 --> 02:39.115
which should be
a dream come true,

02:39.159 --> 02:40.377
but for the first time
in my life,

02:40.421 --> 02:41.900
I'm having writer's block.

02:42.988 --> 02:43.902
Why?

02:43.946 --> 02:45.861
My advice, just take a break.

02:45.904 --> 02:49.299
Okay? Take a walk.
Look at some art.

02:49.343 --> 02:50.648
Kiss your girlfriend.

02:50.692 --> 02:51.823
I keep thinking
I should be breaking

02:51.867 --> 02:52.998
the Baxter Brothers
novels down

02:53.042 --> 02:54.957
like, scientifically,
or something.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.873
That could work,
but you could also...

02:58.700 --> 03:00.267
...kiss your girlfriend.

03:01.398 --> 03:02.834
-[both chuckle]
-I'm sorry.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.408
[indistinct voices]

03:13.715 --> 03:15.673
[eerie music playing]

03:17.545 --> 03:19.416
[stammers] What are you
all doing here?

03:19.460 --> 03:21.984
[spooky tone]
Julian needs a body, Cheryl.

03:22.027 --> 03:24.204
So we're giving him yours.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.292
[screaming]

03:25.988 --> 03:28.338
[gasping]

03:32.690 --> 03:33.996
[eerie music playing]

03:38.305 --> 03:39.915
[music increases in tempo]

03:46.530 --> 03:47.792
[door opens]

03:49.446 --> 03:50.360
What?

03:53.320 --> 03:55.322
Andrews, you asked us
to be big brothers,

03:55.365 --> 03:57.149
not soldiers in a turf war.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.282
Who did this?

03:59.326 --> 04:00.675
I got a pretty good idea.

04:03.373 --> 04:04.722
It was definitely Dodger.

04:04.766 --> 04:06.855
He's been coming after us
for weeks.

04:06.898 --> 04:08.117
We've been chipping away
at his gang,

04:08.160 --> 04:10.293
there's more kids
getting off the streets,

04:10.337 --> 04:11.773
but there's only
so much we can do

04:11.816 --> 04:14.341
until Dodger himself
is behind bars.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.908
I can add Sketch Alley
to the nightly patrol area.

04:16.952 --> 04:18.562
That's great,
but go after Dodger.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.260
He works out of
the Wipeout Arcade.

04:22.436 --> 04:25.308
[Betty] So, based on
the last few days
of following Charles,

04:25.352 --> 04:26.788
this is what I've logged.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.529
7:00 a.m. he leaves
the Five Seasons

04:28.572 --> 04:29.617
where he has a suite

04:29.660 --> 04:30.966
and goes to
the FBI field office.

04:31.009 --> 04:34.317
He has all of his meals
at Pop's or our house.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.232
And then rounding out
his daily routine,

04:36.276 --> 04:38.669
he goes to
the Casa Grande Gym
for a 90-minute-workout,

04:38.713 --> 04:39.931
including weekends,

04:39.975 --> 04:41.411
and then he goes back
to the Five seasons.

04:43.326 --> 04:44.545
Well, um...

04:44.588 --> 04:46.895
I'm no expert, Betty, but...

04:46.938 --> 04:50.246
...it doesn't sound like
Charles is a serial killer.

04:50.290 --> 04:54.076
Kinda just sounds like,
he's a... a lonely gay guy.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.426
Or maybe he's both.

04:59.821 --> 05:01.039
Oh, my God.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.043
Of course.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.831
Now that the trials are over,

05:09.874 --> 05:12.355
I think it's time
to let bygones be bygones.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.924
[speaking Spanish]

05:15.967 --> 05:17.578
[Hiram] I want us
to move forward.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.754
No more secrets, no more lies.

05:19.797 --> 05:21.495
Speaking of secrets and lies,

05:21.538 --> 05:24.759
how many more secret children
should we be expecting?

05:24.802 --> 05:27.065
Hermosa is your one and only
half-sibling.

05:27.675 --> 05:28.937
I swear.

05:28.980 --> 05:31.853
If we did decide
to move forward together...

05:33.158 --> 05:34.856
...what exactly
would that look like?

05:34.899 --> 05:38.468
Well, now that the prison
is bringing in a good income,

05:38.512 --> 05:40.514
I'd like to return
to my true passion.

05:40.557 --> 05:41.384
Extortion?

05:42.124 --> 05:42.951
Murder?

05:43.430 --> 05:44.344
Rum.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.782
Papi's passion is rum.

05:47.825 --> 05:50.872
Rum has been in our family
for generations,

05:50.915 --> 05:53.048
and Hermosa,
who runs our clubs in Miami,

05:53.091 --> 05:54.441
will be staying in Riverdale,

05:54.484 --> 05:57.879
to establish
a rum outpost here.

05:57.922 --> 06:00.403
I also thought she could
help out at the Speakeasy.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.145
No.

06:03.188 --> 06:05.277
I don't need any more help
at La Bonne Nuit.

06:05.321 --> 06:08.237
With the exception
of my newest hostess.

06:09.934 --> 06:13.764
And seeing as how
this is our house,

06:13.808 --> 06:17.115
you two can show
yourselves out.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.774
Are you sure it's safe
out here in the night?

06:23.818 --> 06:25.428
I'll be all right, Mr. Jones.

06:26.516 --> 06:27.822
What's up?

06:27.865 --> 06:30.477
Well, after your intel
and probable cause,

06:30.520 --> 06:32.304
we raided
the Wipeout Arcade,

06:32.348 --> 06:35.569
turned over every Pinball
and Pac-Man machine in it.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.527
Found plenty of
contraband but...

06:39.050 --> 06:40.530
...none on Dodger.

06:40.835 --> 06:42.227
He was clean.

06:42.271 --> 06:44.404
And let me guess, you found it
on a bunch of kids?

06:45.230 --> 06:47.276
That scumbag
is using them, Mr. Jones.

06:47.319 --> 06:51.019
Even so, I can't arrest Dodger
unless I find evidence on him.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.455
You're not going to.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.239
Not as long as he has
these kids working for him.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.898
[instrumental music plays]

07:04.380 --> 07:05.381
[sighs]

07:10.517 --> 07:13.476
[Jughead] I think there's
a real life mystery
in these books.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.304
Now, I've gone and re-read
the entire series

07:15.347 --> 07:17.175
and I noticed
something strange.

07:17.219 --> 07:19.700
Where there is a hoarse voice
and an overall tone,

07:19.743 --> 07:22.659
sure, you can tell when
a new ghostwriter takes over.

07:22.703 --> 07:25.706
Oh, yeah,
a writer can't completely
suppress their own style.

07:25.749 --> 07:27.490
Exactly. The verbiage,
the phrasing,

07:27.534 --> 07:28.883
these things are like
literary fingerprints.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.189
And when I went back
to read the first book,

07:31.233 --> 07:34.366
its fingerprint is unlike
any of the rest of them.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.325
It's raw, it's real.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.718
The characters have tension.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.850
There's political commentary
woven throughout it.

07:39.894 --> 07:42.462
They mention the war,
the boys have summer jobs,

07:42.505 --> 07:44.464
and none of the rest of them
are this grounded.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.204
Meaning?

07:46.248 --> 07:48.337
Well, allegedly, Mr. DuPont
wrote the first five books

07:48.380 --> 07:49.730
before passing the series off.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.122
But after my analysis,

07:51.166 --> 07:53.821
the stylistic differences
from book one to book two

07:53.864 --> 07:55.300
are too distinct to ignore.

07:55.344 --> 07:58.086
There's no way that whoever
wrote the first novel

07:58.129 --> 07:59.174
wrote the following.

07:59.217 --> 08:00.175
There's just no way.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.482
Okay, well, who wrote it then?

08:04.614 --> 08:06.224
This is gonna sound
crazy, okay?

08:07.791 --> 08:09.271
What if it was my grandfather?

08:11.186 --> 08:14.494
Jug, your conspiracy theories
are usually... spot on,

08:14.537 --> 08:18.541
but this one feels like
a real stretch.

08:19.324 --> 08:20.369
I know.

08:21.196 --> 08:22.632
This is the one missing
puzzle piece

08:22.676 --> 08:24.373
I have of my grandfather.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.244
Think about it, Betty.

08:26.288 --> 08:28.682
He sent me a first edition,

08:28.725 --> 08:30.335
first Baxter Brothers book.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.555
And if that's
not coincidental enough,

08:33.121 --> 08:34.514
he wrote inside...

08:36.428 --> 08:39.693
..."Never let them
take anything from you."

08:39.736 --> 08:42.565
Does that not imply that
something was stolen from him?

08:42.609 --> 08:43.784
Implies, yes.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.699
Proves, no.

08:45.742 --> 08:48.266
You need proof, Jug.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.139
Yeah, you're right.

08:51.182 --> 08:52.270
I'll get proof.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.751
I know I'm onto something.
I know it.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.015
Meanwhile,

08:58.059 --> 09:01.149
how's the mystery of our
suspicious brother going?

09:01.192 --> 09:03.281
I'm following a hunch, too.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.458
[electrical buzzing]

09:10.637 --> 09:12.203
[tense music plays]

09:16.512 --> 09:17.644
Hello, Chic.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.654
I want to know about Charles.

09:27.697 --> 09:29.830
That story
you told us about him.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.309
Is it true
that you lived together

09:31.353 --> 09:33.268
at the Last Resort
Youth Hostel?

09:33.747 --> 09:35.096
Yes, it is.

09:36.663 --> 09:37.794
When I went there,

09:37.838 --> 09:39.187
a neighbor told me

09:39.230 --> 09:41.363
about seeing bloody sheets
in the dumpster

09:41.406 --> 09:43.495
and Charles
mysteriously vanishing.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.149
Does any of that ring a bell?

09:45.193 --> 09:48.805
Charles, your brother and I,
we were together.

09:48.849 --> 09:52.374
One time, we brought
a friend home with us,

09:52.417 --> 09:54.637
and we were doing
Jingle-Jangle

09:54.681 --> 09:55.769
a little too much,

09:56.726 --> 09:58.815
and things got out of control.

09:58.859 --> 10:00.556
Charles snapped.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.603
It was like
some darkness took over.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.780
He grabbed a pair of scissors

10:06.823 --> 10:08.608
and he stabbed the guy
to death.

10:10.218 --> 10:12.655
How do I know that
you're telling the truth?

10:12.699 --> 10:15.136
Why would I lie
at this point, Betty?

10:17.268 --> 10:19.357
What does Charles say happened?

10:22.186 --> 10:24.232
[footsteps approaching]

10:28.628 --> 10:30.673
Babe, what gives?

10:30.717 --> 10:32.632
I thought you were
going to school today.

10:32.675 --> 10:33.502
[sighs]

10:34.677 --> 10:35.547
I was.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.637
For realsies.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.160
But...

10:39.203 --> 10:41.510
I can't leave Nana and
the twins here alone with...

10:42.424 --> 10:44.382
[mouthing] you know who.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.863
[sighs] Cheryl,
this has to end.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.648
You've missed
way too much school.

10:50.780 --> 10:51.912
Okay, so get up,

10:51.955 --> 10:53.478
or I'm gonna
drag you there myself.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.306
Okay, T.T.

10:56.481 --> 10:57.700
[exhales]

10:57.744 --> 10:59.223
But there's one thing
we need to do first.

11:04.968 --> 11:08.406
Fact, evil spirits can't cross
a circle of salt.

11:08.450 --> 11:11.192
It's a barrier against
all forms of malevolence.

11:11.975 --> 11:12.802
Okay.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.326
All done.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.806
I'll get dressed and off we go.

11:17.938 --> 11:19.679
[eerie music playing]

11:21.637 --> 11:25.510
Wait, you went
and saw Chic about me?

11:25.554 --> 11:28.252
Why not just ask me,
if you're so damn curious?

11:28.296 --> 11:30.951
Because I don't trust you.
All right?

11:30.994 --> 11:33.518
All I know is
that you're predisposed
to being a serial killer

11:33.562 --> 11:35.085
and I've been burned before.

11:35.129 --> 11:36.521
What did he even say to you?

11:36.565 --> 11:38.741
Oh, he spun quite the yarn.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.003
Yeah. About how you
stabbed a man

11:40.047 --> 11:41.309
with a pair of scissors

11:41.352 --> 11:43.354
when you were high
on Jingle-Jangle.

11:43.398 --> 11:44.878
Oh.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.836
Now I take everything Chic
says with a grain of salt...

11:48.272 --> 11:49.926
...but do you have
a polygraph machine

11:49.970 --> 11:51.362
we can use here?

11:52.102 --> 11:53.234
Yes.

11:53.974 --> 11:54.801
Why?

11:57.020 --> 11:58.761
[Archie] Toby, Eddie.

11:58.805 --> 12:01.372
Tell me, why do you guys
keep running with Dodger?

12:01.808 --> 12:04.027
Well, he pays us.

12:04.071 --> 12:06.290
Yeah, in...
in Wipeout coinage.

12:06.334 --> 12:07.727
So you're giving your money
right back to him?

12:07.770 --> 12:10.338
Plus, we get all the free
pizza that we want.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.819
You guys realize
you're risking everything,

12:12.862 --> 12:14.995
your entire future, your lives,

12:15.038 --> 12:16.387
for pizza and arcade games?

12:19.956 --> 12:22.872
You guys don't have
any spare arcade games
lying around, do you?

12:22.916 --> 12:24.787
What's this now, Archiekins?

12:24.831 --> 12:27.790
[sighs] I'm trying to get
these kids away
from Dodger's Arcade.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.749
Step one,
give them another option.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.794
What you're doing
at the El Royale

12:31.838 --> 12:33.491
is so inspiring, Archie,

12:33.535 --> 12:35.276
but not enough people
know about it.

12:35.319 --> 12:36.886
Well, I can write
about the center

12:36.930 --> 12:37.800
in the Blue and Gold.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.323
And I'll ask my vendors

12:39.367 --> 12:41.804
to see if they can help
rustle up some arcade games.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.545
[announcer on P.A.]
Will Cheryl Blossom

12:43.588 --> 12:46.113
please report to
the principal's office?

12:46.156 --> 12:48.768
Cheryl Blossom
to the principal's office.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.729
What for was I
summoned Ms. Bell?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.035
Cheryl... [sighs]

12:55.078 --> 12:57.341
...there's been an accident
at Thistlehouse.

12:57.385 --> 12:59.691
One of the twins, Dagwood,

12:59.735 --> 13:01.998
[breath trembling]
swallowed a ping-pong ball

13:02.042 --> 13:03.173
and started to choke.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.087
What?

13:04.131 --> 13:05.393
He was taken to the hospital

13:05.436 --> 13:09.701
where Dr. Saperstein
performed a tracheotomy.

13:09.745 --> 13:10.746
On Dagwood?

13:10.790 --> 13:13.749
Oh, he's doing very well,
I'm told.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.796
Your grandmother's
at the hospital with Juniper,

13:16.839 --> 13:18.188
waiting for you.

13:18.232 --> 13:19.668
I'll get to
the hospital posthaste

13:19.711 --> 13:22.758
but there's one thing
I need to take care of first.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.629
[Veronica] In the words of
Dame Julie Andrews,

13:24.673 --> 13:26.327
"Let's start at
the very beginning."

13:26.370 --> 13:28.851
So, hostess details to track.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.548
Who's coming,
where to seat them.

13:30.592 --> 13:32.724
Ms. Danbers near
Bob Potter, always.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.683
-Mmm-hmm.
-Where not to seat them.

13:34.726 --> 13:37.642
Booth 11 is the worst.
Enemies only.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.993
Okay, hold... hold on.
I'm gonna need a pen.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.821
-Mom...
-[sighs]

13:41.864 --> 13:43.126
...don't worry.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.824
I'll be right behind the bar
if you need me.

13:50.264 --> 13:51.308
[mysterious music plays]

13:51.352 --> 13:52.832
Damn you, Demon Doll.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.579
Of course, you'd be here.

14:01.623 --> 14:04.278
How dare you go after Dagwood
to get to me?

14:05.583 --> 14:06.976
-[wood creaking]
-[footsteps]

14:08.369 --> 14:09.849
Don't move. Either of you.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.942
[Cheryl] Aunt Cricket,
Uncle Bedford?

14:15.985 --> 14:19.728
Cheryl, we let ourselves in.
Hope that's all right.

14:21.164 --> 14:21.991
-[moans]
-[thuds]

14:25.038 --> 14:26.474
[Hiram] Veronica.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.521
Oh, God.

14:31.958 --> 14:32.784
Daddy.

14:33.873 --> 14:34.874
Hermosa.

14:35.744 --> 14:38.094
You're not on the
reservation list.

14:38.138 --> 14:39.922
Well, I couldn't miss
your mother's

14:39.966 --> 14:41.881
re-entry into the workforce,
could I?

14:43.056 --> 14:44.796
At the clubs I run in Miami,

14:44.840 --> 14:47.408
I always keep a table reserved
for special guests.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.106
Same.

14:50.150 --> 14:51.978
Mark them down for booth 11.

14:59.202 --> 15:00.508
Shall we begin?

15:03.076 --> 15:03.903
[clicks]

15:06.993 --> 15:09.909
You claimed you and Chic
met on the streets.

15:11.171 --> 15:11.998
True or false?

15:12.824 --> 15:13.825
True.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.610
When we were both
at our lowest.

15:17.917 --> 15:18.961
Yes or no?

15:19.005 --> 15:20.093
Someone was murdered

15:20.136 --> 15:21.398
in the room you shared
at the hostel?

15:23.792 --> 15:24.967
Yes.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.664
I came home from
the grocery store one day

15:26.708 --> 15:28.449
and found a dead man
in our bed.

15:29.580 --> 15:32.322
Chic covered in his blood.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.020
Some trick that he had
brought home.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.067
My instincts took over.

15:38.111 --> 15:40.461
I dissolved the body with lime
in the bathroom tub,

15:41.201 --> 15:42.985
threw out the sheets,

15:43.029 --> 15:44.944
scrubbed the room clean
with bleach.

15:45.553 --> 15:46.858
Chic watched.

15:48.077 --> 15:49.078
It was the end of us.

15:51.037 --> 15:51.951
I left him.

15:52.560 --> 15:53.822
Started over.

15:55.563 --> 15:56.825
[Betty] Next question.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.567
Are you hiding
anything from us?

16:01.438 --> 16:03.179
[suspenseful music plays]

16:09.229 --> 16:11.622
Tell me what, Charles.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.845
I'm a recovering addict.

16:17.933 --> 16:20.544
I attend weekly
Narcotics Anonymous meetings.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.854
Here, in Riverdale,
they're held at my gym.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.771
Charles I--

16:29.814 --> 16:30.990
-[polygraph clicks off]
-That's my big secret, Betty.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.688
[Velcro ripping]

16:34.384 --> 16:35.907
Hope you're satisfied.

16:44.177 --> 16:45.482
[door slams]

16:50.879 --> 16:51.880
Mr. Lodge.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.491
What the hell
are you doing here?

17:01.977 --> 17:04.893
I came because I never
had the chance to, er...

17:08.114 --> 17:11.204
...tell you that I'm sorry
for your loss, Archie.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.683
Your father was a good man...

17:13.728 --> 17:15.121
...and he'd be proud of you.

17:17.297 --> 17:18.472
Thank you, sir.

17:21.475 --> 17:23.303
And in his honor,

17:23.346 --> 17:25.870
I'd like to make
a charitable donation.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.959
[check tearing]

17:28.003 --> 17:29.918
I hear this place
could use the help.

17:29.961 --> 17:31.572
Oh, no, no.
We're all good here.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.008
Thanks.

17:33.617 --> 17:36.011
It's a blank check, Archie.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.579
All your problems,
your money woes, they go away.

17:39.971 --> 17:41.538
Nothing's that simple with you.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.106
Like I said, we're all good.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.238
Thanks.

17:49.764 --> 17:50.591
Oh.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.637
Oh, T.T.

17:53.681 --> 17:56.597
I had the most horrible,
phantasmagoria.

17:57.815 --> 18:00.122
Dagwood swallowed
a ping-pong ball

18:00.166 --> 18:03.212
and my accursed family
came to Thistlehouse.

18:04.213 --> 18:05.780
Oh, good, she's up.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.521
Cheryl dear,

18:07.564 --> 18:09.653
we'd love to see you
downstairs,

18:09.697 --> 18:11.133
once you've collected yourself.

18:12.656 --> 18:14.223
My attorney tells me
you're here to discuss

18:14.267 --> 18:15.790
our maple syrup business?

18:15.833 --> 18:18.009
Yes. we want to sell it.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.837
The rest of the family
is in agreement.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.883
With your father dead
and Penelope in the wind,

18:21.926 --> 18:26.540
we need your participation
and signature to move forward.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.151
And why, pray tell,
do you vipers want to sell

18:29.195 --> 18:31.240
what's left of
our family's legacy?

18:31.284 --> 18:33.416
The business hasn't been
profitable in years.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.896
It's bleeding us dry.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.202
[scoffs]

18:37.681 --> 18:40.510
Babe, it's up to you.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.860
This house has caused you
nothing but pain.

18:43.383 --> 18:44.688
If you sold it,

18:44.732 --> 18:48.214
we could start somewhere new,
somewhere fresh.

18:52.696 --> 18:54.655
Your proposal makes
a modicum of sense.

18:56.787 --> 18:57.875
I'll consider it.

18:57.919 --> 19:00.051
That's wonderful news.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.402
Now, would you mind
if we went down to the chapel

19:02.445 --> 19:05.492
to light a votive candle
of thanksgiving to celebrate?

19:05.535 --> 19:06.623
Excuse you?

19:06.667 --> 19:08.190
[stammers] Go where?

19:08.234 --> 19:09.670
To the chapel.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.280
We always visit
with the ancestors

19:11.324 --> 19:13.021
whenever we come
to Thistlehouse.

19:13.064 --> 19:15.458
Absolutely not.
You're not going down there.

19:15.502 --> 19:16.590
Now be gone!

19:17.243 --> 19:18.287
All of you.

19:18.331 --> 19:19.723
You won't be getting
my signature,

19:19.767 --> 19:22.291
nor will you ever visit
that chapel again.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.380
It is off limits
to anyone but me.

19:25.381 --> 19:26.295
[clears throat]

19:43.356 --> 19:44.357
Mi amor.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.098
Hiram?

19:48.187 --> 19:49.753
What the hell
are you doing here?

19:50.363 --> 19:51.886
I want to come home.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.670
But you don't
live here anymore.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.107
Now just... stop.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.763
Veronica and I
are finally free of you.

19:59.807 --> 20:01.287
Is that what
freedom looks like?

20:02.723 --> 20:06.030
Playing hostess at a
teenager's gin joint.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.080
Let me back in.

20:12.123 --> 20:14.082
You don't have to work
another day ever again.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.390
You'd be my wife again.

20:18.347 --> 20:19.305
[scoffs]

20:19.348 --> 20:20.262
Over my dead body.

20:21.829 --> 20:23.265
That can be arranged.

20:28.488 --> 20:30.664
Was that foreplay
or punishment?

20:31.317 --> 20:32.622
Punishment.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.885
For having Tall Boy
take potshots at me.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.323
Like you do with Minetta?

20:39.499 --> 20:40.761
Now you know.

20:41.370 --> 20:43.459
Some couples, they...

20:43.503 --> 20:45.896
...tie each other up
to spice things up.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.683
[whispers] But you and me,
we oder hits.

20:51.032 --> 20:53.382
That's why we keep doing
this little dance.

20:53.426 --> 20:54.775
[breathing heavily]

20:56.690 --> 20:57.821
Now...

20:59.432 --> 21:00.389
...I need you.

21:03.349 --> 21:04.785
I need you by my side.

21:06.874 --> 21:08.441
I need you in my bed.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.007
[Hermione gasps]

21:11.313 --> 21:13.533
[whispers] So say yes
and we'll start over.

21:13.576 --> 21:14.925
We'll always be married.

21:14.969 --> 21:17.276
-We'll always be man and wife.
-[exhales sharply]

21:18.581 --> 21:20.148
I already regret this.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.152
[inhales]

21:28.025 --> 21:29.853
[Jughead] So, I've been
doing some digging.

21:29.897 --> 21:32.421
I pulled copies of
Stonewall Prep's
literary magazine

21:32.465 --> 21:34.771
from the year that my grandpa
and Mr. DuPont attended.

21:34.815 --> 21:37.034
In the table of contents,
it lists,

21:37.078 --> 21:39.776
"A story written
by Forsythe the First,"

21:39.820 --> 21:41.300
but it was torn out.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.127
It's like every trace
of his writing

21:43.171 --> 21:44.738
at Stonewall Prep
is just gone.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.435
Jug, where did your grandpa
go to school

21:46.479 --> 21:47.436
after Stonewall Prep?

21:47.480 --> 21:48.437
Riverdale High.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.920
Wasn't there
a literary magazine

21:52.963 --> 21:54.443
here, too, back in the day?

21:55.096 --> 21:56.793
I'll be on the next train.

21:56.837 --> 21:58.708
[Veronica] I see you got
my arcade games

21:58.752 --> 22:00.406
but where are the kids?

22:01.363 --> 22:02.321
A good question.

22:03.496 --> 22:04.323
Toby. Eddie.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.195
Where are your boys?

22:07.238 --> 22:08.631
Didn't you tell them
we've got arcade games?

22:08.675 --> 22:09.980
They can play for free.

22:10.024 --> 22:12.853
Yeah, but Dodger's still
giving them free pizza.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.944
All right, well,
you can tell your boys

22:16.987 --> 22:19.163
that, tonight,
it's not just video games

22:19.207 --> 22:20.774
that are free at El Royale.

22:20.817 --> 22:24.212
It's burgers, and fries,
and milkshakes from Pop's.

22:25.039 --> 22:26.388
We'll get the word out.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.520
Come on.

22:29.522 --> 22:30.349
Voila.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.482
I love you, Ronnie.

22:33.526 --> 22:36.355
Same, Archiekins. Same.

22:39.401 --> 22:40.402
T.T... [sighs]

22:40.446 --> 22:42.099
...this doll has
conspired to bring

22:42.143 --> 22:45.364
my extended family upon us
for some devilish work.

22:47.627 --> 22:48.889
We'll stop Julian...

22:49.933 --> 22:51.370
...and my hated family.

23:06.689 --> 23:07.516
There.

23:08.517 --> 23:09.910
Drown, spirit.

23:09.953 --> 23:11.259
[tense music plays]

23:12.478 --> 23:14.567
[creaking]

23:15.132 --> 23:16.003
Mom?

23:16.699 --> 23:18.397
I have a surprise for you.

23:23.445 --> 23:24.533
Are those...

23:26.317 --> 23:27.406
[Hiram] Mine.

23:28.537 --> 23:30.060
I am moving back in.

23:32.802 --> 23:33.760
Your mother and I--

23:33.803 --> 23:34.891
No.

23:38.155 --> 23:39.418
I wanna hear it from her.

23:42.595 --> 23:43.465
Veronica...

23:43.509 --> 23:45.206
Mom.

23:45.249 --> 23:47.382
...I have invited
your father back.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.297
Why?

23:51.473 --> 23:52.605
He's a murderer.

23:53.519 --> 23:54.476
And what am I?

23:55.651 --> 23:57.261
I can't believe you.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.264
We were done with him.

24:00.308 --> 24:03.137
Mija, can we talk about
what this is really about?

24:03.616 --> 24:04.791
[sighs]

24:04.834 --> 24:07.184
Your sister. But you
don't need to worry.

24:07.228 --> 24:08.621
You're still my favorite.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.580
The apple of my eye.

24:11.624 --> 24:12.929
My special little girl.

24:12.973 --> 24:14.714
So, rest assured,
there is no reason

24:14.757 --> 24:16.237
for you to be jealous of her.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.413
Are you deranged?

24:19.545 --> 24:21.024
I'm not...

24:21.068 --> 24:21.938
...jealous of her.

24:21.982 --> 24:23.244
Yes, you are.

24:24.593 --> 24:25.638
And it's natural.

24:28.554 --> 24:31.034
You are unbelievable.
Both of you.

24:31.557 --> 24:32.688
[door slams]

24:34.255 --> 24:35.865
[Jughead] Wait, hold on.

24:35.909 --> 24:39.739
The story in this one
written by Frosty Pajamas.

24:39.782 --> 24:41.610
What? That sounds like a joke.

24:41.654 --> 24:42.481
Or it's a pen name.

24:43.656 --> 24:44.874
Think about it.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.528
Frosty is almost an anagram
for Forsythe.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.226
And pajamas for PJs.

24:49.270 --> 24:51.620
P and J, Pendleton and Jones?

24:52.578 --> 24:54.536
Betty, this is totally
the same writing.

24:54.580 --> 24:57.408
The syntax, the word choice,
even the character names.

24:57.452 --> 24:59.541
There's a character in here
named Bitsy Bane.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.282
Wait, that sounds
vaguely familiar.

25:01.325 --> 25:04.067
Bitsy Bane is
the next door neighbor
of the Baxter Brothers.

25:07.810 --> 25:10.509
This was written years before
the first Baxter Brothers book.

25:11.466 --> 25:12.989
Is that enough proof for you?

25:15.470 --> 25:16.515
I would say so.

25:23.739 --> 25:24.610
How could you, Betty?

25:25.785 --> 25:27.003
How could I what?

25:27.047 --> 25:29.702
You visited that miscreant
imposter, Chic.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.008
Well, that's my business,
isn't it?

25:32.052 --> 25:34.097
Yes, except afterwards,
he used his lawyer

25:34.141 --> 25:36.143
to contact the FBI,
to report a murder

25:36.186 --> 25:38.058
that happened in
The Black Hood's house.

25:38.711 --> 25:39.755
Not committed by him

25:39.799 --> 25:41.670
but by a woman
named Alice Cooper.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.544
He said the man was bludgeoned
to death in the kitchen.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.111
[tense music plays]

25:49.025 --> 25:50.200
A shady man?

25:50.244 --> 25:51.071
Yes.

25:52.159 --> 25:53.508
He also claims
to know the location

25:53.552 --> 25:55.466
of the murder victim's
burial site.

26:02.996 --> 26:05.825
All that evidence
is still out there.

26:05.868 --> 26:08.262
Why, Betty?
Why kick this hornet's nest?

26:08.305 --> 26:10.656
I'll take the lead
on this investigation.

26:10.699 --> 26:12.571
Maybe with assist
from the local town sheriff.

26:14.747 --> 26:16.400
See if the remains
are where Chic claims.

26:19.012 --> 26:20.274
Don't wait up for us.

Hey, jump in, jump in.

26:46.735 --> 26:47.606
[exclaims]

26:50.696 --> 26:53.089
Well, what do
you think, Archie?

26:53.873 --> 26:54.830
I think you're amazing.

26:54.874 --> 26:55.744
[Veronica chuckles]

26:55.788 --> 26:57.006
It's a good cause.

26:57.050 --> 26:59.313
Archie. Archie.

26:59.356 --> 27:02.316
There's some guy named Dodger
outside who wants to see you.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.101
All right, let me see
what this clown wants.

27:05.145 --> 27:06.233
I'll be back.

27:06.276 --> 27:08.148
Reg, make sure
everyone stays inside.

27:13.806 --> 27:16.199
What the hell did I tell you
last time, Dodger?

27:16.243 --> 27:17.636
You're not welcome here.

27:18.332 --> 27:20.421
You're costing me
my work force.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.249
They're kids.

27:22.292 --> 27:23.816
They're happy to work for me.

27:26.122 --> 27:27.384
Or they were...

27:28.429 --> 27:29.822
...till you showed up.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.826
All right, what do you want?

27:34.957 --> 27:35.871
Huh?

27:35.915 --> 27:37.264
You want to fight me?

27:37.917 --> 27:38.874
Sure.

27:40.223 --> 27:42.661
But don't you need to put
your mask on first?

27:44.837 --> 27:46.708
What are you talk...
What are you talking about?

27:47.753 --> 27:49.276
See, I told you.

27:51.278 --> 27:54.107
I told you he's
that guy in the mask.

27:54.150 --> 27:55.935
The one making trouble for us.

27:55.978 --> 27:57.110
Aren't you?

27:57.153 --> 27:58.241
I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:58.285 --> 27:59.634
I think you do.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.855
I think you know
exactly what I'm talking about.

28:02.898 --> 28:04.639
Cops are on their way, asshat.

28:10.993 --> 28:12.560
No need for them to come.

28:14.127 --> 28:15.781
I got the confirmation I need.

28:17.565 --> 28:18.697
[whistles]

28:20.916 --> 28:22.135
I'll be seeing you, friend.

28:33.276 --> 28:34.974
How... How'd it go?

28:35.017 --> 28:36.062
[FP] We're okay, Alice.

28:36.105 --> 28:37.672
We're gonna be okay.

We, uh...

took care of that.

28:43.809 --> 28:44.766
Thank you.

28:45.767 --> 28:46.725
Thank you, Charles.

28:53.557 --> 28:54.776
Well...

28:54.820 --> 28:56.517
...we should go file
the report then.

28:57.953 --> 28:58.824
Wait, Charles.

29:00.477 --> 29:01.914
You don't have to go.

29:03.872 --> 29:06.614
If you're willing to go out
on a limb for my...

29:08.094 --> 29:10.487
For our family,

29:10.531 --> 29:12.707
then I should be able
to do that for you.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.928
And I'm sorry. Okay?

29:16.929 --> 29:17.756
Okay.

29:19.366 --> 29:21.194
[sighs] Thank you for meeting
with me, Mr. DuPont.

29:21.237 --> 29:23.500
Like I said, I wanted
to have this conversation
with you in person.

29:23.544 --> 29:25.285
Oh, not at all,
Mr. Jones, son.

29:25.328 --> 29:26.460
How can I help you?

29:26.503 --> 29:27.766
I wanted to
talk to you about

29:27.809 --> 29:29.811
the first book
in the Baxter Brothers series.

29:30.377 --> 29:31.639
What about it?

29:32.814 --> 29:33.728
You didn't write it.

29:34.947 --> 29:36.731
Pardon me?

29:36.775 --> 29:39.821
I found a short story that
my grandfather had written

29:39.865 --> 29:41.823
in an old Riverdale High
literary magazine.

29:42.389 --> 29:43.999
It has a lot,

29:44.043 --> 29:45.958
actually, the same elements,

29:46.001 --> 29:50.310
and it was published
years before the first
Baxter Brothers book.

29:51.528 --> 29:53.661
I assure you, Mr. Jones,

29:53.704 --> 29:56.664
I wrote the first
five books myself.

29:56.707 --> 29:59.406
No, sir, you wrote books
two through five.

29:59.449 --> 30:01.974
The first one was written
by my grandfather.

30:02.017 --> 30:04.890
That book has the same tone
as his short story.

30:04.933 --> 30:07.414
It has the syntax,
it has his voice--

30:07.457 --> 30:09.590
Let me stop you right there.

30:10.591 --> 30:12.288
Do you know
what the worst thing

30:12.332 --> 30:13.899
you can accuse
a writer of being?

30:14.987 --> 30:16.205
A plagiarist.

30:16.249 --> 30:17.946
And based on what?

30:18.947 --> 30:20.557
A story written by some

30:20.601 --> 30:24.953
bottom-feeding dropout
in a third rate school's

30:24.997 --> 30:27.042
so-called literary magazine?

30:27.086 --> 30:28.304
The text doesn't lie.

30:28.348 --> 30:29.784
I'm not a thief.

30:32.439 --> 30:33.832
But your father,

30:34.267 --> 30:35.529
the Sheriff,

30:36.835 --> 30:37.966
he's a thief.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.054
Oh, yes.

30:39.098 --> 30:41.013
And much, much worse.

30:41.056 --> 30:42.666
A vagabond.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.668
What is it with you people?

30:45.800 --> 30:48.368
You're given an inch
and you want the whole field.

30:49.935 --> 30:50.892
For God's sake,

30:50.936 --> 30:53.373
do you know
who the hell I am?

30:53.416 --> 30:57.899
Do you know what
the Baxter Brothers franchise
means to Stonewall Prep?

30:57.943 --> 30:59.553
It built Stonewall Prep.

30:59.596 --> 31:01.685
I built Stonewall Prep.

31:01.729 --> 31:03.557
The record deserves
to be set straight.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.125
Get out of my sight now,

31:06.168 --> 31:08.779
while I'm still willing
to forget that you had...

31:09.824 --> 31:11.782
...the audacity to summon me.

31:16.135 --> 31:17.876
You're very lucky

31:17.919 --> 31:19.529
I don't take you
to the Headmaster

31:19.573 --> 31:20.791
and get you expelled

31:20.835 --> 31:23.316
for this vicious
and slanderous attack.

31:24.447 --> 31:26.014
Now get out.

[dramatic music plays]

It's open seating.

31:49.168 --> 31:50.778
Specials are on the board.

31:52.432 --> 31:55.043
Actually, I came
to have a little chat.

31:57.089 --> 31:58.351
Sister to sister.

31:58.873 --> 31:59.743
Let me guess.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.658
Daddy sent you.

32:02.485 --> 32:04.226
One last valiant tactic

32:04.270 --> 32:06.446
to get me back
into the family fold.

32:10.363 --> 32:12.539
You're very smart, Veronica.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.064
You don't know our father
as well as you think you do.

32:16.108 --> 32:18.675
There is literally
nothing you could tell me

32:18.719 --> 32:21.461
about Hiram Lodge
that would surprise me.

32:25.204 --> 32:26.857
My mommy was a singer

32:27.423 --> 32:29.643
at one of Papi's Miami clubs,

Sala de Oro...

32:33.212 --> 32:34.561
...where they met.

32:36.389 --> 32:37.651
They had a fling.

32:38.043 --> 32:39.522
Mmm-hmm.

He took advantage of her,
she got pregnant,

32:43.744 --> 32:45.180
he left her high and dry.

32:45.224 --> 32:46.834
Actually, he took care of her,

32:47.400 --> 32:49.184
until she died.

32:49.228 --> 32:51.317
And then he took care of me.

32:54.146 --> 32:55.756
Papi and your mother

32:55.799 --> 32:57.497
are renewing
their vows tomorrow,

32:57.540 --> 32:59.020
and they'd like for you
to come.

33:00.326 --> 33:01.588
You're kidding.

33:01.631 --> 33:03.633
Come, or don't.

I'm just the messenger.

33:12.294 --> 33:14.079
Look,

33:14.122 --> 33:15.994
you're entitled
to your opinion of him,

33:17.125 --> 33:18.605
but the father I know...

33:19.606 --> 33:20.999
...there's good in him.

33:23.392 --> 33:25.046

33:25.090 --> 33:25.916
Okay?

[Cheryl] Clearly
I'm going to have
to get the locks changed.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.229
Explain to us, Cheryl,

33:34.273 --> 33:37.145
why is there a chain
on the chapel's gate?

33:37.189 --> 33:38.320
I told you, Uncle Bedford,

33:38.364 --> 33:40.235
no one is allowed
in there but me.

33:40.279 --> 33:41.410
As we suspected,

33:41.454 --> 33:43.108
you're clearly having
a psychotic break.

33:43.151 --> 33:44.239
What?

33:44.283 --> 33:45.936
As soon as we
have you declared unfit,

33:45.980 --> 33:49.244
we're selling the factory,
the grounds, everything.

33:49.288 --> 33:50.811
Get out.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.900
Get out, you parasites!

33:53.161 --> 33:54.206
We're going.

33:54.249 --> 33:55.468
Oh, and we will find out

33:55.511 --> 33:57.861
whatever it is you're hiding
in our chapel.

34:05.956 --> 34:07.132
[Jughead]
You see it, don't you?

34:07.958 --> 34:09.395
[sighs]

34:09.438 --> 34:12.267
Certainly appears to be
your grandfather's writing.

34:13.225 --> 34:14.791
It's undeniable.

34:14.835 --> 34:16.184
Mr. Chipping,
you have to help me

34:16.228 --> 34:17.707
bring this to light.

34:17.751 --> 34:20.014
We have to prove to everyone
that Mr. DuPont's a fraud.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.451
Look, I understand that
your reputation is on the line,

34:22.495 --> 34:24.975
and maybe even your position
here at Stonewall.

34:25.019 --> 34:28.196
But it's the truth,
Mr. Chipping.

34:28.240 --> 34:29.154
Yes, I'll help you.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.766
How could I look myself
in the mirror

34:32.809 --> 34:35.290
as a teacher,
as a writer, if I didn't...

34:35.334 --> 34:37.292
[exhales]

34:43.255 --> 34:44.691
What the hell?

34:52.177 --> 34:53.091
Mom, we got to go.

34:53.700 --> 34:55.223
What do you mean?
Go where?

34:57.443 --> 34:59.009
I don't know,
the Five seasons, maybe.

34:59.053 --> 35:00.924
But you got to pack your bag
and we got to get out of here.

35:00.968 --> 35:02.187
At least until things
cool down.

35:02.230 --> 35:04.319
What things, Archie?
You're scaring me.

35:04.363 --> 35:05.842
It's the Rec center.

35:05.886 --> 35:07.235
Mom, not everyone's happy
about what we are doing there,

35:07.279 --> 35:08.149
and I've made some enemies.

35:09.368 --> 35:10.978

Hermosa?

35:39.615 --> 35:40.747
What the hell is that?

35:43.010 --> 35:45.578
A painting Papi had
commissioned for me.

35:45.621 --> 35:48.058
Papi said to put it
in a place of honor.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.452
He said,

35:50.496 --> 35:53.151
"Only the best
for the apple of my eye."

35:55.501 --> 35:56.850
Of course, he did.

35:58.765 --> 36:00.201
I should have known.

36:03.248 --> 36:04.336
You know what?

36:05.424 --> 36:07.904
I was going to tell Papi,
as you call him,

36:07.948 --> 36:10.168
that I'd be attending
his bogus vow renewal,

36:10.690 --> 36:12.518
but instead...

36:12.561 --> 36:14.607
...tell him
I'll be skipping it.

36:14.650 --> 36:16.957
My mom can roll out
the welcome mat

36:17.000 --> 36:19.264
for you two rum-sucking
leeches, if she wants.

36:19.307 --> 36:22.571
But I'm not giving up my space
nor my place in this family.

36:22.615 --> 36:24.138
I'm not giving an inch.

36:24.399 --> 36:25.748
Not to you.

36:26.314 --> 36:27.185
Not ever.

36:31.624 --> 36:32.929
[Hiram] I have to admit,

36:32.973 --> 36:35.193
I'm surprised
you called, Archie.

36:37.456 --> 36:38.457
There is this criminal

36:38.500 --> 36:40.110
working out of the
Wipeout Arcade

36:40.589 --> 36:41.677
named Dodger.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.638
He's a loose cannon.
He needs to be stopped.

36:47.074 --> 36:49.946
And what did this
Dodger do, exactly?

36:49.990 --> 36:52.688
He shot at my house
and my mom.

36:52.732 --> 36:54.603
Well, that sounds
like a job for FP.

36:54.647 --> 36:56.301
I reported
what happened, Mr. Lodge,

36:56.344 --> 36:57.606
but Dodger's slippery.

36:57.650 --> 36:59.434
And you know as well as I do,

36:59.478 --> 37:01.958
some things have to be
handled another way.

37:02.002 --> 37:04.352
This is about protecting
what's left of my family.

37:04.657 --> 37:05.875
Of course.

37:07.660 --> 37:10.228
[sighs] But...

37:10.271 --> 37:11.272
I hope you're not suggesting

37:11.316 --> 37:12.752
that I commit
an act of violence

37:12.795 --> 37:13.883
against this thug.

37:15.407 --> 37:16.495
I'm really sorry

37:16.538 --> 37:17.757
about what happened
to your mother.

37:18.671 --> 37:20.760
But... [sighs]

37:20.803 --> 37:22.327
Yeah, there's nothing
I can do for you, Archie.

37:27.375 --> 37:28.463
[door closes]

37:29.377 --> 37:31.988
Scholars,
uh, as you know,

37:32.032 --> 37:33.947
today, we will be discussing

37:33.990 --> 37:36.558
Joseph Conrad's
Heart of Darkness.

37:36.602 --> 37:38.386
About the loss of
a man's moral...

37:42.216 --> 37:43.435
[sighs]

37:43.478 --> 37:44.436
Mr. Chipping?

37:45.567 --> 37:46.394
Are you okay?

37:47.874 --> 37:49.397
I'm sorry, Jughead.

37:49.832 --> 37:51.225
I couldn't help you.

37:52.357 --> 37:53.836

Do you hear that?

I...

38:21.734 --> 38:22.865
I think it's Julian

trying to escape
from the chapel.

38:25.564 --> 38:27.783
[tense music plays]

[breath trembling]

38:42.145 --> 38:45.192
I... I always knew
that there was a...

38:45.235 --> 38:48.195
A certain sickness
in our bloodline.

38:48.238 --> 38:49.065
But this...

38:49.762 --> 38:51.459
...this is monstrous.

-You...

this instant.

Hi.

39:28.975 --> 39:30.368
How did it all go?

39:30.803 --> 39:33.022
Smooth as cream, babe.

39:33.066 --> 39:35.460
FP led me right to where
he buried the body,

39:35.503 --> 39:36.678
we moved what was left,

39:36.722 --> 39:38.419
and everyone
was appropriately grateful.

39:39.638 --> 39:41.335
Even Betty?

39:41.379 --> 39:42.380
Even Betty.

39:43.468 --> 39:44.556
That's great.

39:48.473 --> 39:49.474
I love you, babe.

I love you, too.

[Cheryl] Why, Aunt Cricket,

39:54.653 --> 39:55.741
whatever can we do to you?

39:55.784 --> 39:57.482
It's Bedford, Cheryl dear.

39:57.525 --> 39:59.005
He didn't come
home last night,

39:59.048 --> 40:00.659
and I was wondering
if you'd seen him.

40:00.702 --> 40:02.400
He said he might come
around Thistlehouse.

40:04.097 --> 40:06.665
Why, no. We didn't see him.

40:06.708 --> 40:09.581
Oh, well, you wouldn't mind
if I had a peek around then,
would you?

40:09.624 --> 40:11.104
Actually, Auntie,

40:11.757 --> 40:13.498
I would mind.

40:13.541 --> 40:14.803
Unless you have
a search warrant

40:14.847 --> 40:16.414
from the local
constable in hand.

40:17.153 --> 40:17.980
I don't.

But I'll get one.

Good luck with that.
