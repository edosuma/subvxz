<i>(Tate)</i>
<i>The jury in Los Angeles</i>

00:40.006 --> 00:42.304

03:11.324 --> 03:12.757
(Cerreta)
So, what happened?

03:12.825 --> 03:14.417
Tate caught two in the chest.

03:14.494 --> 03:16.189
His people took him
to St. Luke's.

03:16.262 --> 03:18.389
This guy who ran away.
Did you get a
good look at him?

03:18.464 --> 03:21.661
The shooter?
White, dark hair.
His gun was a.38.

03:21.734 --> 03:23.065
You see him use it on Tate?

03:23.136 --> 03:24.433
I didn't see him shoot.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.164
Talk to anybody who did?

03:26.239 --> 03:27.297
No, sir.

03:27.373 --> 03:28.362
Then we're just assuming.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.671
(Harlans)
Where was I?
Where the hell were you?

03:30.743 --> 03:32.301
If you cops had been
on the stick,

03:32.378 --> 03:34.005
Marcus would
still be alive right now.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.174
I wouldn't know about that,
but if you'd answer
my question.

03:37.250 --> 03:40.185
I was watching the side door,
like I was supposed to,

03:40.253 --> 03:42.551
and all I seen was
this white...

03:42.622 --> 03:44.681
Coming at me with a gun.

03:45.525 --> 03:46.787
Then what'd you do?

03:46.893 --> 03:50.192
I went for my steel,
but the sucker got me first.

03:52.031 --> 03:54.625
I'll need your weapon
for ballistics.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.425
Check his permit.
Yes, sir.

03:56.502 --> 03:59.062
Instead of harassing my ass,
why don't you go
after the white dude

03:59.138 --> 04:01.538
that killed Marcus?

04:01.841 --> 04:03.240
Excuse me.

04:03.309 --> 04:04.901
Eight bodyguards,
eight guns.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.947
Once the shooting started,
all the youngbloods
got in on the act.

04:08.047 --> 04:09.878
The bomb was an M60
in the trash can.

04:09.949 --> 04:11.746
Just loud enough
to make a diversion.

04:11.818 --> 04:15.049
It worked.
I haven't found anybody
who saw the actual shooting.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.418
The suspect's described
as tall, short, fat,

04:17.490 --> 04:20.254
thin, dark hair, blonde hair.

04:21.293 --> 04:25.958
One thing everybody agrees on:
White, white, very white.

04:26.833 --> 04:27.765
Tells you something.

04:27.834 --> 04:30.132
Yeah, summer's here.

05:54.721 --> 05:56.621
[Reporters screaming]

05:58.358 --> 06:00.189
We wanted to coordinate
with you before

06:00.259 --> 06:02.352
we released any information.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.525
Dr. Reid, police.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.925
Doctor, you worked
on Marcus Tate?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.026
Two chest wounds.
Time of death: 11:37.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.765
You recover any slugs for us?

06:12.839 --> 06:14.431
No. One was
a through-and-through.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.371
The other one lodged
near the spine.

06:16.442 --> 06:18.034
Real pinball.
Hit all the vitals.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.375
Where's the body now?
Upstairs, sixth floor.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.171
Did you post security guards?

06:23.249 --> 06:24.682
Tate came with his own posse.

06:24.751 --> 06:25.877
Terrific.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.317
Mrs. Tate's wishes...

06:27.387 --> 06:29.048
She's with the body
in room 602.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.457
So, is it okay to
release the information?

06:33.626 --> 06:36.026
Yeah, go ahead.
You start the riot.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.029
Is Mrs. Tate in there?

06:43.169 --> 06:44.397
We'd like to talk to her.

06:44.470 --> 06:45.835
You people
aren't welcomed here.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.736
We don't need an invitation,
my friend.

06:47.807 --> 06:49.570
Maybe if you just
told her we're here.

06:49.776 --> 06:52.609
Why don't you bring
a black cop down here
to talk to us?

06:52.712 --> 06:55.545
Sorry, but we're as good
as you're gonna get.

06:59.786 --> 07:02.016
They want to talk
to Satima, Mr. Books.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.988
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

07:04.157 --> 07:07.320
Mrs. Tate is in no condition
to speak with anyone.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.894
Are you a relative,
Mr. Books?

07:08.961 --> 07:10.258
No, I'm the Executive Director

07:10.329 --> 07:13.162
for the African-American
Congress and in-house
legal counsel.

07:13.232 --> 07:16.429
Good. Then you know we have
to talk to all witnesses
as soon as possible.

07:16.502 --> 07:18.493
She's in no condition
to speak with anyone.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.799
Now I assure you,
it would be simpler

07:20.873 --> 07:22.602
if you can find
someone that he can talk to.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.439
The last time I looked,
the badge only came
in two colors:

07:26.179 --> 07:27.271
Silver and gold.

07:27.346 --> 07:30.611
And that means,
one way or another,
he is gonna talk to us.

07:30.683 --> 07:31.843
Mike.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.916
We'll be in touch, Mr. Books.

07:38.724 --> 07:41.625
The body mustrt be moved
till the ME gets here.

07:42.862 --> 07:45.956
I read papers,
I know their politics,
and they're freaking racists.

07:46.032 --> 07:47.863
We're talking
damage control, Mike.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.662
So they say "fetch,"
and we bark and run?

07:49.735 --> 07:50.724
No.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.771
We don't go parading around
in hoods, either.

07:52.839 --> 07:55.307
Here's some bedtime reading.
I bet you didn't know

07:55.374 --> 07:58.207
the Jews were responsible
for the crack epidemic
up in Harlem.

07:58.277 --> 08:00.575
The AAC's not
exactly mainstream.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.940
Mainstream enough
to elect three councilmen.

08:03.015 --> 08:05.449
As long as their grandstanding
doesn't interfere,

08:05.518 --> 08:07.543
I don't care how we get
their cooperation.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.952
Get me something more than
"suspect described as
a white male."

08:11.023 --> 08:14.117
Okay. The patrolman saw
a white male with a.38.

08:14.193 --> 08:17.856
One of Tate's men
was shot in the leg
by a white male with a.38.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.124
Ballistics?

08:19.198 --> 08:21.792
We can't match that bullet
with anything found in Tate.

08:21.868 --> 08:23.267
This is getting better
every minute.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.237
Did anybody actually
see Tate getting shot?

08:26.372 --> 08:28.340
(Cerreta)
Tate's wife was there.
Bodyguards.

08:28.407 --> 08:30.841
But unless Phil and I
change our racial persuasion,

08:30.910 --> 08:32.775
nobody's talking to us.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.076
AAC is up on Lenox, right?

08:36.182 --> 08:39.913
I'll talk to Malone in the 28,
see if he can't
kick open a few doors.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.747
<i>(receptionist)</i>
<i>AAC. May I help you?</i>

08:44.824 --> 08:47.816
I was just ahead of Marcus...
six, eight feet.

08:48.561 --> 08:50.051
Where was the man
with the gun?

08:50.129 --> 08:52.427
Just inside
the entrance hall.

08:52.498 --> 08:54.159
So you were watching him?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.331
Just keeping an eye out.

08:58.671 --> 09:01.435
Was he the only
white face in there?

09:02.174 --> 09:05.337
There's always
a few white faces
at the rallies.

09:05.444 --> 09:09.073
Mostly protestors.
But if they just want to
come in and listen

09:09.582 --> 09:12.415
then we don't pay them
any particular attention.

09:12.518 --> 09:13.780
(Cerreta)
Got it.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.444
All right,
there was an explosion.

09:15.588 --> 09:17.112
What did you do?

09:17.223 --> 09:20.818
I turned toward Marcus,
then I saw a white face
come out of the crowd.

09:21.527 --> 09:23.051
How close was he?

09:23.129 --> 09:25.097
About 10 feet to my left.

09:25.164 --> 09:27.223
He had the gun out,
he shot Marcus.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.234
Two shots, then he booked.

09:29.869 --> 09:32.497
(Otis)
I tried to grab him,
but the crowd was crazy.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.598
I saw him shoot Harlans,
then he was gone.

09:36.442 --> 09:38.569
What did this guy look like?

09:38.644 --> 09:41.044
Brown hair. About 35, 40.

09:42.114 --> 09:44.139
You ever seen him before?

09:44.216 --> 09:47.652
Hey, I don't know.
All you white boys look alike.

09:49.455 --> 09:51.218
(Books)
Um, ahem.

09:51.857 --> 09:54.485
This is a very emotional time
for us, Detective.

09:54.660 --> 09:57.823
Do you have anything
on this man? Ballistics?

09:58.264 --> 10:00.164
(Cerreta)
Only the slug from
Mr. Harlans' leg.

10:00.232 --> 10:02.132
The slug from
Mr. Tate was unusable.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.169
He had eight bodyguards.

10:04.236 --> 10:05.794
(Logan)
Expecting company?

10:06.739 --> 10:09.299
Marcus didn't fear any man.
Only God.

10:09.742 --> 10:11.141
The guards were my idea.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.643
Pretty fatalistic
for a lawyer.

10:14.480 --> 10:19.417
I was a... a punk with a do-rag
when Marcus pulled
me out of the gutter.

10:20.486 --> 10:22.420
This man saved my life.

10:22.655 --> 10:26.250
If it were up to me,
he would have been wearing
a bulletproof vest.

10:26.325 --> 10:28.657
Sounds like not everybody
was in his fan club.

10:28.761 --> 10:31.992
When you speak your mind,
you incite controversy.

10:32.098 --> 10:33.531
We get threatened
all the time:

10:33.599 --> 10:36.693
KKK, Aryan Nation,
Sons of Abraham.

10:37.336 --> 10:39.896
Well, I guess what goes
around comes around.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.775
It took Malcolm 25 years
to gain respect.

10:44.343 --> 10:48.507
I figure 10 for Marcus Tate,
but his message
will get through

10:49.215 --> 10:52.378
and the AAC will be stronger
for his martyrdom.

10:55.021 --> 10:57.819
If you had just
heard his speech.

10:57.890 --> 11:00.791
He wanted to work
with the white community.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.587
And now they've killed him.

11:04.463 --> 11:05.589
His reputation...

11:05.665 --> 11:07.189
(Satima)
Marcus was pragmatic.

11:09.435 --> 11:11.335
The acquittals in LA,

11:12.571 --> 11:15.563
the looting
and the self-destruction.

11:15.641 --> 11:19.008
He realized that an outsider
cannot invoke change.

11:19.478 --> 11:21.639
And the night
of the shooting?

11:22.648 --> 11:23.808
Yes.

11:24.750 --> 11:28.049
He finished his speech.
Roland said
the side alley was blocked,

11:28.154 --> 11:30.145
so we were going to
use the front door.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.222
You were with your husband?

11:32.291 --> 11:33.952
Walking right behind him.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.220
There was an explosion,
then shots.

11:38.564 --> 11:41.032
Did you see the man
who shot your husband?

11:41.667 --> 11:44.602
He was standing there,
holding a gun, staring.

11:44.770 --> 11:47.102
People were pointing at him.

11:47.873 --> 11:51.240
Do you have any idea
who this man could have been?
Mmm-mmm.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.277
But I'll never
forget that face.

11:55.281 --> 11:57.841
A lone gunman.
High-profile target.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.715
You don't just
get up one day,
go shoot a public figure.

12:00.786 --> 12:01.753
You stalk him.

12:01.821 --> 12:03.448
Look for a chink in his armor.

12:03.522 --> 12:06.889
If white-boy got close
to Tate this time,
maybe he's been there before,

12:06.959 --> 12:08.517
and maybe somebody
might have seen him.

12:08.594 --> 12:12.030
Or taken his picture.
After all,
Tate makes for good copy.

12:12.198 --> 12:13.790
[Car honking]

12:14.200 --> 12:17.727
I'll tell you what,
next time I'm gonna
buy stock in Kodak.

12:17.803 --> 12:21.705
These guys must burn 10 rolls
for every picture they run.
Ah-huh.

12:21.807 --> 12:23.468
You got something?

12:25.911 --> 12:29.108
The beard. Here, look.
Is this the same guy?

12:31.550 --> 12:33.916
Let me see something.
Come here.

12:38.791 --> 12:40.622
Look. Look at this.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.996
(Logan)
How's that?

12:48.100 --> 12:50.830
Is that better?
And right there?

12:51.737 --> 12:53.728
(Cerreta)
They could be triplets.

12:54.473 --> 12:55.872
(Logan)
Or just bad lighting.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.407
(Cerreta)
One way to find out.

12:58.644 --> 13:00.509
These men were
all photographed

13:00.579 --> 13:03.104
at AAC rallies
in the past year.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.742
As you can see,
they don't all look alike.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.317
You recognize any of them?

13:08.387 --> 13:09.445
From these?

13:09.522 --> 13:10.716
Yeah.

13:11.023 --> 13:13.423
You're just going
through the motions.

13:13.592 --> 13:14.957
Here we go again.

13:15.027 --> 13:16.927
Darryl Gates here
to whup me good.

13:17.663 --> 13:20.860
Mr. Cook, once we get
this guy in custody,

13:20.933 --> 13:22.400
you can make
all the speeches you want.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.164
Until then, just look
at the damn pictures.

13:32.545 --> 13:33.876
This one.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.175
He lost the beard,
but he kept the eyes.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.648
(Cerreta)
You've seen him before?

13:38.784 --> 13:40.149
Yeah, I think so.

13:40.219 --> 13:43.711
I don't know who he is,
but he's been around.

13:44.456 --> 13:46.287
Thank you, Mr. Cook.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.395
Mrs. Tate.

13:55.968 --> 13:59.460
We think the suspect
stalked your husband
before the shooting.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.299
(Logan)
Ma'am, these men
were photographed

14:02.374 --> 14:04.604
at your husband's speeches
this past year.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.274
Now one of them
might be the man you saw.

14:09.048 --> 14:10.481
That's him.

14:10.983 --> 14:12.951
That's the man with the gun.

14:14.453 --> 14:16.580
You're absolutely
sure of that?

14:17.356 --> 14:19.119
I'm absolutely sure.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.593
Two for two.

14:26.365 --> 14:29.391
African Episcopal Church,
Harlem, May 7.

14:30.469 --> 14:33.529
LaSalle Hall,
downtown, May 28.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.073
Jackson Auditorium,
Harlem, July 26.

14:37.142 --> 14:40.976
We have photos of
rallies outside the city
at the same time period.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.343
No sign of our guy.

14:42.414 --> 14:43.711
(Cragen)
Oh, lucky us.

14:44.350 --> 14:47.012
One of our approximately
eight million locals.

14:47.119 --> 14:50.316
What do you think,
about, uh, 36, 37?
Somewhere in there.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.222
The beard is trimmed,
the clothes are clean.
He's middle class.

14:53.292 --> 14:54.486
Jewish?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.994
Tate wasrt exactly poster boy
for B'nai Brith.

14:57.062 --> 15:00.122
Somewhere in
the five boroughs, somebody's
gotta love this face.

15:00.199 --> 15:03.999
We go public with a picture,
our guy's gone forever.

15:06.939 --> 15:10.102
Mikey, what about this here?
What is this writing?

15:11.543 --> 15:13.909
What's that? L-A-C?

15:14.046 --> 15:17.038
(Cragen)
L-A-C-R <i>...</i> Lacrosse?

15:17.116 --> 15:18.674

Yeah.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.649
R-S-T. Amherst.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.655
Joe College.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.815
Okay, let's go.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.158
Say he's in his late 30s.

15:33.265 --> 15:37.258
That would make him what,
class of '75, '76?

15:38.137 --> 15:40.435
That is if he
actually graduated.

15:44.543 --> 15:45.840
[Exclaims]

15:45.911 --> 15:47.401
Is it just me,
or did everybody

15:47.479 --> 15:49.003
look like
Charlie Manson then?

15:49.114 --> 15:51.048
No,
they only became criminals

15:51.250 --> 15:53.184
after they got their
Wall Street haircut.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.082
I got it. Gotcha.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.816
Here.

16:01.827 --> 16:03.761
Well, hello, Mitchell Koblin.

16:04.163 --> 16:07.826
Class of '74.
Varsity lacrosse.
Debating club.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.692
Voted most likely to join
the Weather Underground.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.930
I bet his parents
are very proud.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.297
[Sighing]
Koblin. Koblin.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.299
Koblin.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.013
Harvey, Lawrence, Robert.

16:25.284 --> 16:26.615
No Mitchell.

16:26.685 --> 16:28.482
Alumni directory. Right here.

16:29.054 --> 16:32.217
Koblin, Mitchell.
62 Gramercy Park East.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.485
[Car honking]

16:38.497 --> 16:40.294
Yes, that's Mitchell.

16:41.967 --> 16:44.367
He shaved his beard
last April.

16:47.473 --> 16:48.701
What do you want with him?

16:48.774 --> 16:50.332
He may have been
witness to a crime.

16:50.809 --> 16:52.470
Well, is he all right?

16:52.544 --> 16:54.842
We haven't been able
to talk to him yet.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.141
Whers the last time
you saw your son?

16:57.216 --> 16:59.207
My birthday, last month.

16:59.718 --> 17:02.687
Did you talk to Sandy?
His wife.

17:03.155 --> 17:05.020
Where can we reach them now?

17:05.357 --> 17:06.915
They live on
the Upper West Side.

17:07.059 --> 17:08.617
1290 West End.

17:08.926 --> 17:12.021
Does your son currently
belong to
any political organizations?

17:12.097 --> 17:13.894
What?
(Cerreta)
We checked his resume.

17:13.965 --> 17:16.059
In the '70s, he was
a little left of center.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.729
He had some arrests
for assault
and weapons violations.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.135
Mitchell was cleared
of all that.

17:20.204 --> 17:21.467
Wait.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.538
What the hell do
you really want?

17:23.608 --> 17:26.099
He was present
at the murder of Marcus Tate.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.542
It was a rally.
Hundreds of people.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.912
He was armed with
a.38 caliber revolver.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.109
(Mrs. Koblin)
That's ridiculous.

17:32.184 --> 17:33.845
You want to talk to us,
talk to our attorney.

17:33.919 --> 17:35.784
We're gone.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.556
I can't believe
Mitchell would do that.

17:39.625 --> 17:40.853
I mean, he sometimes...

17:40.926 --> 17:43.759
Mrs. Koblin,
if you could just tell us
where we could find him.

17:43.829 --> 17:46.559
Mitchell and I are divorced.
He moved out last February.

17:46.632 --> 17:47.997
His parents didn't mention it.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.001
He was too embarrassed
to tell them.

17:50.536 --> 17:51.730
We were the dream couple.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.795
You know, all the colors
bleeding into one.

17:54.106 --> 17:56.438
Did Mitchell ever
talk to you about Tate?

17:56.708 --> 18:01.509
Nothing. But Mitchell might
not have bought every word
out of Tate's mouth.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.275
(Logan)
So he killed him?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.551
He respected Marcus,
his ideas,

18:06.618 --> 18:08.745
and he insisted I do the same.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.721
Mitchell wanted to get me
in touch with my black roots.

18:13.992 --> 18:15.323
Come again?

18:15.527 --> 18:17.427
Mitchell and I...

18:18.130 --> 18:21.031
For nine years,
we shared the same bed
for different reasons.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.624
I thought I was getting
Gramercy Park and...

18:23.702 --> 18:25.636
Mitchell wanted Harlem?

18:25.704 --> 18:27.535
(Mrs. Koblin)
And I obliged.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.035
It turned him on.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.475
It was like
the blacker I got,
the more he wanted me.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.770
It was sick.

18:34.847 --> 18:38.840
I wanted to rub
his nose in it,
so I got a job at AAC.

18:39.184 --> 18:40.708
(Cerreta)
You worked
for the Tate organization?

18:40.786 --> 18:42.845
Since last year,
as a bookkeeper.

18:43.522 --> 18:44.750
It was a mistake.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.152
Why is that?

18:47.326 --> 18:51.023
He accused me of sleeping
with every man at work,
including Marcus.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.621
What about the day
Marcus Tate was shot?

18:53.765 --> 18:55.630
Did you see Mitchell there?

18:56.034 --> 18:59.492
I was downstairs
counting receipts.
I heard screams.

18:59.705 --> 19:02.435
By the time I got upstairs,
everything was over.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.840
You have any idea
where we can find him?

19:04.910 --> 19:07.572
Last I heard,
he was teaching summer school

19:07.746 --> 19:10.510
at I.S. 134
in the South Bronx.

19:10.782 --> 19:13.751
[Bell ringing]
Mitchell taught
Current American History.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.878
Very up guy.
The kids used to love him.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.853
What, did he
confiscate their guns?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.855
He got laid off at
the end of last term.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.984
The budget came up short,
they said.

19:22.060 --> 19:24.528
Somebody wanted to redecorate
their offices.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.223
I don't doubt it.
Now he substitutes.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.026
But the guy's fried.

19:28.100 --> 19:31.160
Sits at the front of
the class thinking what,
I don't even wanna know.

19:31.236 --> 19:32.225
You seen him this week?

19:32.304 --> 19:34.670
No, last week.
He taught a couple of days.

19:34.873 --> 19:36.238
You know where
he's living now?

19:36.341 --> 19:39.367
[Bell ringing]
We reached him at
the Mers Athletic, downtown.

19:39.578 --> 19:40.943
Excuse me.

19:41.613 --> 19:43.774
No job, the wife dumped him.

19:43.882 --> 19:46.442
Last time I got dumped,
I put my fist through a door.

19:46.552 --> 19:48.952
This guy gets his ya-yas
out with a gun.

19:50.856 --> 19:54.792
Mr. Koblin has been
a guest since late July,
paid advance through August.

19:56.094 --> 19:58.654
Bet he'll be checking out
sooner than that.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.762
[Telephone ringing]
His key is here.
He is not in his room.

20:03.835 --> 20:05.393
Excuse me.

20:11.410 --> 20:13.002
There's the gymnasium.

20:13.078 --> 20:14.807
Koblirs an ex-jock,
ain't he?

20:36.101 --> 20:37.329
Koblin.

20:43.842 --> 20:45.400
[Buzzer sounding]

20:54.620 --> 20:56.281
Well, well, well.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.494
Mitchell Koblin.

21:10.569 --> 21:11.763
[Grunting]

21:13.138 --> 21:14.571
[Grunting]

21:15.974 --> 21:17.703
(Cerreta)
Mitchell Koblin,
you're under arrest,

21:17.776 --> 21:19.266
for the murder of Marcus Tate.

21:19.344 --> 21:21.107
You have the right
to remain silent.

21:21.179 --> 21:23.147
Anything you do say
can and will be used

21:23.215 --> 21:24.614
against you in a court of law.

21:24.683 --> 21:26.173
You have the right
to an attorney.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.810
If you can't afford one,
one will be provided for you.

21:28.887 --> 21:30.354
Do you understand
these rights?

21:30.455 --> 21:33.288
You guys are nuts!
I didn't kill anyone!

21:34.059 --> 21:35.856
He asked you a question,
Mitchell.

21:35.994 --> 21:37.791
Yeah... yeah,
I understand my rights.

21:37.863 --> 21:39.831
Then shut up and lie still!

21:58.750 --> 22:01.514
How could he possibly know
anything about this murder,

22:01.586 --> 22:03.053
when he had nothing
to do with it?

22:03.121 --> 22:04.088
If he was there.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.418
I didn't hear him say he was.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.082
We have eyewitnesses.

22:07.159 --> 22:10.060

<i>Mr. Cerreta.</i>

<i>That slut's trying</i>
<i>to frame me!</i>
<i>Mitch, that's enough.</i>

22:15.634 --> 22:17.465
You seem to be
very angry about this.

22:17.536 --> 22:18.935
Want to tell me about it?

22:19.037 --> 22:21.870
Are you
investigating a murder here,
or a divorce?

22:21.940 --> 22:24.374
If one leads to the other,
both.

22:24.609 --> 22:27.544
Political assassinations
as crimes of passion.

22:27.612 --> 22:30.080
You're going to make
a lot of conspiracy buffs
unappy.

22:30.148 --> 22:32.810
Let's just see
what we have here, okay?

22:34.219 --> 22:35.447
Here.

22:36.288 --> 22:38.051
What about these?

22:38.123 --> 22:41.581
Tate's schedule
and the rally announcements,
Mitchell.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.385
What were these things
doing in your room?

22:44.863 --> 22:47.263
Fine, we're not denying
he was at the rally.

22:47.332 --> 22:49.664
To see his wife,
nothing more.

22:50.068 --> 22:53.196
What about this?
This is an article about Tate.

22:53.939 --> 22:57.431
You have written here
in the margin,
"typical Jew baiting."

22:58.276 --> 23:00.608
And here,
"hate-mongering crap."

23:02.881 --> 23:05.349
Seems to me you had
a bone to pick with Mr. Tate.

23:05.417 --> 23:07.681
And that constitutes intent?

23:07.986 --> 23:11.683
You must be lining up suspects
from here to Plattsburgh.

23:14.693 --> 23:16.558
You're missing
the big picture, Paul.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.595
My guy is a patsy.

23:19.598 --> 23:21.122
He didn't kill Tate.

One for two on ballistics.
The slug from Tate's unusable,

23:27.606 --> 23:29.073
but the one from
the bodyguard's leg

23:29.141 --> 23:31.268
is a conclusive match
with Koblirs.38.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.375
The big picture
just got smaller.

23:53.131 --> 23:54.098
How does the defendant plead?

23:54.166 --> 23:56.430
Not guilty, Your Honor,
on all counts.

23:56.501 --> 23:59.527
Due to the highly
volatile nature
of the crimes charged,

23:59.604 --> 24:03.438
the State feels denying bail
will be in the best
interest of all concerned,

24:03.508 --> 24:04.736

Civil liberties,

my client hasn't been
convicted of anything.

24:08.780 --> 24:12.147
I'm all for civil liberties.
I'm also for keeping him
around to enjoy them.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.115
So you can try him on
baseless charges?

24:14.186 --> 24:16.347
With all due respect,
your logic escapes me.

24:16.421 --> 24:18.685
It's you who's called upon
to provide the logic,
Counselor,

24:18.790 --> 24:20.655
and it's you who hasn't
met that burden.

24:20.759 --> 24:22.852
The defendant will be held
without bail pending trial.

24:22.928 --> 24:24.520
Your Honor...
(judge)
Counselor,

24:24.629 --> 24:27.530
judicial discretion is
a wonderful thing. Next.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.789
Gary Lowenthal?

24:29.935 --> 24:30.959
Yes, sir.

24:31.369 --> 24:34.031
His politics made a left turn
at Haight-Ashbury.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.471
What's he doing
defending Tate's murderer?

24:36.541 --> 24:39.704
Koblirs parents are probably
coughing up $400 an hour.

24:39.945 --> 24:41.469
Pays for a lot of pro bono.

24:41.546 --> 24:43.275
Something Koblin
knows all about.

24:43.615 --> 24:45.378
10 years ago,
Koblin was arrested

24:45.450 --> 24:47.543
for assaulting a cop
at a political protest.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.882
Legal aid pled him down
to menacing.

24:52.157 --> 24:55.024
Unfortunately his politics
matured from rocks to bullets.

24:55.126 --> 24:57.560
If anything, the mars
politically psychotic.

24:57.662 --> 25:00.688
His bio begins with the SDS
and ends with the JDL.

25:00.799 --> 25:03.461
And Tate's been called
an anti-Semite
for years, right?

25:03.535 --> 25:05.526
Only he'd eased his position.

25:05.604 --> 25:08.630
Recently he made
public overtures to
the Jewish community.

25:08.707 --> 25:09.969
Koblin had to know that.

25:10.041 --> 25:12.532
I think we're looking
at a silver platter here.

25:12.644 --> 25:16.045
We have witnesses,
ballistics.
We don't need motive.

25:16.147 --> 25:19.014
The service should
always include a silver spoon.

25:19.084 --> 25:22.713
If a jury has any doubts,
motive puts them
over the edge.

25:22.787 --> 25:26.120
I'm supposed to get into
a political debate
with the man?

25:27.058 --> 25:30.516
I don't want Gary Lowenthal
tap-dancing his way
into an acquittal,

25:30.595 --> 25:32.085
and a soon-to-be
major motion picture.

25:32.230 --> 25:33.754
Get me a motive.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.996
Koblirs whole world
was collapsing.

25:37.602 --> 25:41.663
He'd lost his job,
he was lying to
his family about his divorce.

25:41.740 --> 25:44.038
Murder is a hell of
a nice bandage.

25:44.776 --> 25:46.903
A loner. An outsider.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.847
His life was about
getting his wife back.

25:50.081 --> 25:52.515
He worshipped her,
she worshipped Tate.

25:52.851 --> 25:55.376
He killed Tate
because his wife dumped him?

25:55.453 --> 25:57.216
Eliminate the competition?

25:57.656 --> 26:00.181
A cry for attention?
Displacement?

26:00.325 --> 26:03.726
Do unto Tate as you thought
Tate was doing unto you.

26:03.828 --> 26:05.261
Pick your pathology.

26:05.363 --> 26:07.126
So if we put his ex
on the stand,

26:07.198 --> 26:09.496
she should give us
all the motive we need, right?

26:14.472 --> 26:17.339
He was always there,
wherever I went.

26:17.409 --> 26:20.674
It got so bad,
I had to get somebody
to walk me home.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.614
(Mrs. Koblin)
He swore he was
going to catch me.

26:23.682 --> 26:25.479
Catch you doing what?

26:26.117 --> 26:27.584
With Marcus.

26:27.886 --> 26:29.513
Were you, in fact,
having an affair

26:29.588 --> 26:31.783
with Marcus Tate,
Mrs. Koblin?

26:34.693 --> 26:36.183
(Stone)
Mrs. Koblin?

26:37.729 --> 26:38.718
Yes.

26:38.797 --> 26:39.821
Thank you.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.523
(Stone)
Your witness.

26:42.067 --> 26:43.728
Has my client ever
done anything

26:43.802 --> 26:46.362
that would indicate to you
he was a violent man?

26:46.438 --> 26:47.564
(Mrs. Koblin)
No.

26:47.639 --> 26:50.699
So he never hit you,
or even threatened to hit you?

26:50.775 --> 26:51.935
No.

26:52.077 --> 26:54.807
Did you ever hear him threaten
to kill Marcus Tate?

26:54.879 --> 26:56.107
(Mrs. Koblin)
No.

26:56.414 --> 26:59.110
Well, I certainly admire
his self-control.

26:59.250 --> 27:00.376
If my wife...

27:00.452 --> 27:01.680
Objection!

27:03.254 --> 27:05.779
Withdrawn.
Tell me, Mrs. Koblin,

27:06.291 --> 27:09.317
to your knowledge,
was yours the only
extramarital affair

27:09.427 --> 27:11.759
Marcus Tate was engaged in?

27:12.731 --> 27:13.891
No.

27:14.399 --> 27:16.424
(Lowenthal)
Is it possible, Mrs. Koblin

27:16.501 --> 27:18.332
that other husbands
were not possessed

27:18.403 --> 27:20.268
with the same
self-control as yours?

27:20.338 --> 27:21.635
Objection.

27:24.275 --> 27:26.334
(Satima)
We had just left the stage.

27:28.246 --> 27:30.339
There was a big explosion.

27:31.416 --> 27:34.977
Then guns,
shooting everywhere.

27:36.688 --> 27:40.283
(Satima)
Mr. Books screamed:

27:40.925 --> 27:42.654
"He shot Marcus."

27:44.162 --> 27:46.653
And I saw Koblin
holding his gun.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.162
And what happened next?

27:50.835 --> 27:52.962
I saw Marcus on the ground.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.467
His mouth was full of blood.

27:59.210 --> 28:01.201
I covered him with my body.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.740
I rode with him
to the hospital.

28:04.816 --> 28:08.252
His head was in my lap,
his hand clenched to mine.

28:10.955 --> 28:13.014
He never opened his eyes.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.655
His grip never let up.

28:21.499 --> 28:23.933
They took him
into the hospital,

28:26.805 --> 28:28.363
but I knew...

28:29.908 --> 28:31.068
[crying]

28:32.610 --> 28:33.941
Thank you.

28:39.984 --> 28:43.317
Just before the explosion,
you said you were
leaving the auditorium.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.948
Were you walking
beside your husband?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.551
I was right behind him.

28:51.096 --> 28:53.155
(Lowenthal)
So before the explosion

28:53.465 --> 28:56.628
you didn't actually see
Mr. Koblin in the hallway?

28:58.002 --> 28:59.162
No.

29:00.338 --> 29:03.705
You heard the gunshots,
then you fell to the ground.

29:04.709 --> 29:06.006
Yes.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.944
But it's true, isn't it,
Mrs. Tate, that you never
actually saw

29:09.013 --> 29:11.379
who it was that
shot your husband?

29:12.083 --> 29:15.348
He had a gun. I saw it.

29:15.820 --> 29:17.412
(Lowenthal)
Yes, but we've heard testimony

29:17.489 --> 29:19.286
that a lot of people
had guns that night.

29:19.657 --> 29:22.023
Isn't it possible
that one of them shot...

29:22.093 --> 29:23.219
Objection!

29:23.294 --> 29:24.352
Mr. Lowenthal,

29:24.863 --> 29:27.764
would you please
refrain from speculation?

29:28.933 --> 29:30.833
It's true, isn't it,
Mrs. Tate,

29:30.902 --> 29:33.234
that your husband received
a lot of hate mail?

29:35.573 --> 29:38.167
The world is
filled with racists.

29:38.877 --> 29:42.677
So if someone
disagrees with your husband,
he's a racist?

29:42.847 --> 29:44.212
Your Honor...

29:44.349 --> 29:45.839
I didn't say that.

29:45.984 --> 29:47.508
(Lowenthal)
Tell me, Mrs. Tate,

29:47.585 --> 29:50.884
uh, were there black men
who disagreed with
your husband's philosophies?

29:50.989 --> 29:52.047
Uh, relevance, Your Honor?

29:52.157 --> 29:54.921
(Lowenthal)
As a matter of fact,
within your own organization

29:55.026 --> 29:56.653
there were men
who believed Marcus Tate,

29:56.728 --> 29:58.855
betrayed the principles
of the AAC.

29:58.930 --> 30:00.420
Some of them, perhaps,
the same men,

30:00.498 --> 30:02.523
who were carrying
guns that night.

30:03.668 --> 30:07.695
People may disagree
with my husband,
Mr. Lowenthal.

30:09.741 --> 30:13.370
But there isn't
one member of the AAC

30:13.478 --> 30:14.809
who wouldn't die for him.

30:14.879 --> 30:15.868
Your Honor...

30:15.947 --> 30:18.074
All right. Approach.

30:22.387 --> 30:24.252
It's America, remember?

30:24.455 --> 30:28.016
The defense is allowed to
present any defense
it deems proper.

30:28.092 --> 30:29.616
(Stone)
Proper, yes. Irrelevant, no.

30:29.694 --> 30:31.252
An alternative motive
is irrelevant?

30:31.329 --> 30:34.355
When they confuse
and mislead a jury, yes.
The fact is...

30:34.432 --> 30:36.423
(judge)
The fact is you're attempting
to blind the jury

30:36.501 --> 30:38.025
with mere suspicion.

30:38.236 --> 30:39.931
Do you have
any direct evidence

30:40.038 --> 30:43.530
that someone else
in the hall was responsible
for the murder?

30:44.576 --> 30:45.600
No.

30:46.544 --> 30:49.240
(judge)
Then Mr. Stone's objection
is sustained.

30:49.681 --> 30:53.310
Remember, Counselor,
contempt is solely
within my discretion.

30:53.384 --> 30:54.783
All right.

30:56.254 --> 30:58.085
No further questions.

30:59.924 --> 31:02.017
I was standing
right next to Marcus.

31:02.093 --> 31:03.993
Yeah, I heard the explosion.

31:04.729 --> 31:07.095
I saw the bastard
pull his gun.

31:08.099 --> 31:09.828
You're referring
to the defendant?

31:09.901 --> 31:11.300
(Otis)
Yeah.

31:11.569 --> 31:14.129
I was almost face to face
with him.

31:14.772 --> 31:18.469
So you're positive
it was Mr. Koblin
who shot Marcus Tate?

31:19.110 --> 31:20.941
(Otis)
I was two, three yards away.

31:21.012 --> 31:23.071
Yeah, I saw him.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.182
Thank you.

31:26.784 --> 31:29.048
You were, at most,
10 feet from the defendant,

31:29.120 --> 31:30.712
you saw him pull his gun,

31:30.788 --> 31:32.050
you saw him shoot.

31:32.123 --> 31:33.317
That's what I said.

31:33.424 --> 31:35.654
One hell of a bodyguard,
aren't you, Mr. Cook?

31:35.727 --> 31:36.989
Objection.

31:37.996 --> 31:40.692
We can do without the sarcasm,
Counselor.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.800
When you were face to face
with the defendant,

31:44.903 --> 31:46.427
was that before the explosion?

31:46.504 --> 31:47.493
Yeah.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.767
(Lowenthal)
So out of all the people
outside the auditorium,

31:49.841 --> 31:51.365
you chose to focus
on Mr. Koblin.

31:51.442 --> 31:52.932
Was it because
he looked suspicious?

31:53.011 --> 31:56.105
Yeah, he did.
My job is to protect Marcus.

31:56.180 --> 31:57.875
From suspicious-looking
people,

31:57.949 --> 32:00.884
or from suspicious-looking
white people?

32:00.952 --> 32:02.112
Objection.

32:02.253 --> 32:03.413
(Lowenthal)
Withdrawn.

32:03.788 --> 32:05.653
True or false, Mr. Cook:

32:05.857 --> 32:08.826
The defendant had
the only white face
in the crowd that night?

32:08.927 --> 32:09.951
That's right.

32:10.028 --> 32:13.486
In fact, the sole reason you
focused on Mr. Koblin
was because he's white.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.122
I said he looked suspicious.

32:15.199 --> 32:17.929
And you're suspicious of
white men, isn't that right?

32:18.002 --> 32:18.969
Objection.

32:19.037 --> 32:20.163
Sustained.

32:20.705 --> 32:23.640
So you were suspicious,
and it wasrt
because he was white.

32:23.708 --> 32:26.108
What was it, then?
Because he had curly hair?

32:26.177 --> 32:27.906
Because he had a big nose?

32:27.979 --> 32:31.346
They talk liberal,
but they hire us to
clean their toilets.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.246
(Lowenthal)
Who are you referring to?

32:33.318 --> 32:35.411
Are you talking about
the people who own banks?

32:35.486 --> 32:36.919
Who own the housing
where you live?

32:36.988 --> 32:38.956
Your Honor...
Am I one of
those people, Otis?

32:39.023 --> 32:43.460
That damn Jew killed Marcus,
and all you Jew lawyers
gonna let him walk?

32:43.528 --> 32:47.555
[Judge pounding gavel]
Mr. Cook, please sit down.

32:55.740 --> 32:59.369
(Lowenthal)
It is clear this witness
did not see the shooter.

32:59.477 --> 33:03.413
He saw a white Jew,
and his prejudice
did the rest.

33:03.514 --> 33:05.675
(judge)
It may be clear to you,
Counselor.

33:05.750 --> 33:09.345
Now, change
your line of questioning,
or have a seat.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.121
No more questions.

33:12.256 --> 33:13.655
Thank you, Your Honor.

33:13.858 --> 33:15.382
[People chattering]

33:16.728 --> 33:20.289
You should've stopped it.
The man killed Marcus,
now he seems like the victim.

33:20.365 --> 33:21.662
The jury will see past that.

33:21.733 --> 33:22.995
What if they don't?

33:23.067 --> 33:26.400
That man gets off,
and those LA riots will look
like a pillow fight.

33:26.504 --> 33:27.664
And you'd endorse that?

33:27.739 --> 33:29.969
I look for justice
inside the courtroom.

33:30.041 --> 33:32.236
Others may not be
quite so enlightened.

33:37.081 --> 33:40.244
(Koblin)
No, I didn't agree
with everything Marcus said.

33:41.252 --> 33:44.187
But I respected him,
the work he was doing.

33:45.590 --> 33:49.686
So you did not, in fact,
go to the rally to kill him.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.560
I went to the rally
to see my wife.

33:53.398 --> 33:57.664
She was trying to avoid me,
but I knew she'd be there.

33:59.203 --> 34:02.570
So I thought I'd catch her
and speak to her
on the way out.

34:05.043 --> 34:08.444
When you heard the explosion,
what did you do?

34:08.746 --> 34:11.408
I was scared.
I pulled my gun.

34:12.683 --> 34:15.846
Then I saw Otis screaming
and pointing at me, so I ran.

34:16.487 --> 34:19.650
(Lowenthal)
And that's when you saw
the security guard, Harlans.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.315
Aiming his gun at me.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.350
So you shot him?

34:24.495 --> 34:26.018
He was gonna shoot me.

34:28.299 --> 34:32.565
Tell me, sir,
why didn't you get rid of
your gun after the shooting?

34:33.771 --> 34:35.068
(Koblin)
Why would I?

34:35.139 --> 34:38.370
I knew a bullet from my gun
didn't kill Marcus Tate.

34:38.976 --> 34:40.773
(Lowenthal)
No further questions.

34:45.116 --> 34:46.481
Mr. Koblin,

34:47.985 --> 34:52.422
why did you think it necessary
to carry a gun to the rally?

34:53.091 --> 34:55.355
I traveled up to
Harlem by subway.

34:55.493 --> 34:57.461
I was just being safe.

34:57.929 --> 35:01.126
You teach in the South Bronx,
isn't that right?

35:01.232 --> 35:02.597
I'm a substitute teacher.

35:02.667 --> 35:05.397
And you commute
by subway, is that right?
Yes.

35:05.837 --> 35:09.068
Tell me, sir, do you carry
a gun in the classroom?

35:09.674 --> 35:10.936
That's different.

35:11.075 --> 35:14.442
Of course, it is.
Marcus Tate isn't
likely to show up

35:14.512 --> 35:16.207
at I.S. 134.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.304
Objection.

35:17.381 --> 35:18.541
Withdrawn.

35:19.750 --> 35:22.617
Uh, Mr. Koblin,
do you love your ex-wife?

35:23.588 --> 35:24.748
Very much.

35:24.822 --> 35:26.619
Yet she slept with
Marcus Tate, right?

35:26.691 --> 35:28.158
You hounded her.

35:28.226 --> 35:30.820
I admit I was a little crazy.
Jealousy's not a crime.

35:30.928 --> 35:32.691
You'd do anything to
get her back, right?

35:32.763 --> 35:34.025
(Koblin)
Not anything.

35:34.098 --> 35:35.929
John Hinckley's a nutcase.
I'm just a little...

35:36.000 --> 35:37.627
A little crazy.

35:46.410 --> 35:49.311
72 hours.
I thought they'd be
in and out by now.

35:49.413 --> 35:52.177
He had our witnesses
tripping over
their own testimony.

35:52.283 --> 35:53.910
He may have confused the jury.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.078
Yeah,
that's his special talent.

35:56.521 --> 36:00.821
He needs only one out of 12,
but I suppose
he's pushing for a mistrial.

36:00.892 --> 36:02.257
On all four burners.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.418
Don't fight it.

36:03.528 --> 36:05.792
At least you'll know his M.O.
On retrial.

36:05.863 --> 36:08.127
The facts speak
for themselves, Adam.

36:08.199 --> 36:10.599
And Lowenthal's two-step
notwithstanding,

36:10.668 --> 36:13.228
[buzzer beeping]
I think the jury will convict.

36:17.441 --> 36:18.669
Yes?

36:20.811 --> 36:22.039
Thanks.

36:23.514 --> 36:24.947
Time to find out.

36:44.235 --> 36:46.829
The first count
of the indictment:

36:46.904 --> 36:50.203
Criminal possession of
a weapon in the third degree.

36:50.308 --> 36:51.900
How do you find?

36:52.076 --> 36:54.237
[Crowd cheering]
Guilty.

36:54.312 --> 36:55.870
(judge)
Second count:

36:57.048 --> 36:59.915
Criminal possession of
a weapon in the second degree.

36:59.984 --> 37:00.973
How do you find?

37:01.052 --> 37:02.144
Not guilty.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.847
[Crowd grumbling]

37:04.322 --> 37:06.187
(judge)
On the third count:

37:07.158 --> 37:10.150
Attempt to commit murder
in the second degree.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.286
How do you find?

37:11.429 --> 37:12.487
Not guilty.

37:12.763 --> 37:14.856
[Crowd grumbling]

37:16.534 --> 37:18.331
(judge)
And the last count:

37:18.402 --> 37:20.370
Murder in the second degree.

37:20.438 --> 37:21.996
How do you find?

37:22.306 --> 37:23.568
Not guilty.

37:24.141 --> 37:26.575
[Crowd jeering]

37:28.446 --> 37:30.971
[Judge pounding gavel]

37:43.394 --> 37:46.056
Will you quiet down
in this court?

37:46.397 --> 37:49.264
[Yelling]

37:51.035 --> 37:54.698
Every black pseudo-politico
from Binghamton
to Brighton Beach,

37:54.772 --> 37:56.433
has been screaming
for my head.

37:56.540 --> 37:58.701
Word on the street is
"no justice, no peace."

37:58.776 --> 38:00.107
At least the weapons charge...

38:00.177 --> 38:02.475
The weapons charge is
a thorn in his paw.

38:03.180 --> 38:05.341
He'll be out in
less than a year.

38:05.416 --> 38:06.678
You talk to the jury?

38:06.751 --> 38:09.549
The foreman said
we never connected
Koblirs gun to the murder.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.178
Otis' testimony
was unreliable.

38:11.255 --> 38:13.382
And the burden of proof
had nothing to do with it.

38:13.457 --> 38:15.516
Lowenthal made
the trial a showcase

38:15.593 --> 38:17.390
for black racism,
the jury bought it.

38:17.461 --> 38:19.429
(Robinette)
They couldn't see the facts
through their fears.

38:19.497 --> 38:23.456
The Constitution guarantees
an impartial jury,
not a jury with thick skin.

38:23.534 --> 38:26.935
Before we start
blue-penciling
the Sixth Amendment,

38:27.872 --> 38:30.807
maybe we ought to
press the rewind button.

38:33.611 --> 38:37.411
I want you to double-check
every word of that
trial transcript.

38:37.481 --> 38:39.039
Fifth Amendment.
Double jeopardy.

38:39.116 --> 38:41.778
I'm not talking about murder.
Mississippi.

38:42.119 --> 38:43.916
Three dead
civil rights workers.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.478
A Federal case.

38:45.556 --> 38:48.582
I want to establish
a case of
civil rights violation.

38:49.093 --> 38:51.618
Maybe we can feed
the Feds a lay-up.

38:53.397 --> 38:55.592
Lowenthal pulled
one rabbit out of his hat.

38:55.666 --> 38:59.102
Even if we make
a Federal case against Koblin,
there must be more in there.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.138
Maybe it wasrt a rabbit.

39:02.039 --> 39:05.202
Hey, you're not saying
that Koblin didn't shoot Tate.

39:05.409 --> 39:07.536
Well,
we're not in Simi Valley.

39:07.611 --> 39:12.241
24 eyes in a jury
sometimes see things
that adversaries overlook.

39:12.550 --> 39:13.983
(Robinette)
Like what?

39:14.485 --> 39:17.648
Maybe Lowenthal was right
about trouble at the AAC.

39:17.755 --> 39:19.620
(Robinette)
What about
the jealous husbands?

39:19.690 --> 39:21.749
We go after everyone
whose wife slept with Tate?

39:21.826 --> 39:24.693
We go after the person
who's conveniently
evading the truth.

39:24.762 --> 39:26.957
Koblirs ex

39:27.932 --> 39:30.423
says that
he bothered her at work.

39:30.735 --> 39:32.464
She had to be escorted home.

39:32.570 --> 39:35.664
Now, if you need
protection over there,
who do you ask?

39:36.540 --> 39:37.507
A bodyguard.

39:37.575 --> 39:38.701
(Stone)
Right.

39:38.776 --> 39:39.708
Otis?

39:39.777 --> 39:40.744
(Stone)
Right.

39:40.811 --> 39:42.335
And if it was Otis,

39:42.413 --> 39:45.314
he's gotta be lying
about not recognizing Koblin.

39:45.649 --> 39:47.981
And it could be he's lying
about a lot more than that.

39:49.920 --> 39:51.581
I didn't think
he was going to hit me.

39:51.655 --> 39:53.520
I just didn't want
to be hassled.

39:53.624 --> 39:55.819
So I asked Otis
to walk me home.

39:56.427 --> 39:59.624
Did Mitchell approach you
when you left the building?

40:00.331 --> 40:01.958
Like the storming
of the Bastille.

40:02.032 --> 40:03.522
They almost came to blows.

40:03.601 --> 40:05.296
Otis and your husband?

40:09.373 --> 40:11.273
Was it true what
Mr. Lowenthal said

40:11.342 --> 40:13.970
about internal dissension
at the AAC?

40:14.445 --> 40:17.278
I'm hardly a member
of the inner sanctum.

40:18.115 --> 40:21.710
You let Koblin walk.
You screwed up.
So why not?

40:21.819 --> 40:24.447
Blame it on the niggers.
They must have done something.

40:24.522 --> 40:27.218
Mrs. Tate,
if there was any infighting
at the AAC...

40:27.324 --> 40:28.723
There wasrt.

40:28.959 --> 40:32.087
We have reason to believe
Otis Cook was involved.

40:32.363 --> 40:34.024
Scrub all you want to,
Mr. Robinette.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.690
It doesn't come off.

40:38.636 --> 40:40.695
The fact is that
Mr. Cook lied to us.

40:40.805 --> 40:43.296
He told police that
he didn't know Mr. Koblin.

40:43.374 --> 40:47.208
Sandra Koblin told us
that they almost came to
blows a month ago.

40:48.412 --> 40:50.505
She has no reason to lie.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.715
Neither do I.

40:53.217 --> 40:54.809
She knows what happened,
Adam.

40:54.885 --> 40:57.854
But there's no way
she's gonna play
show-and-tell with us.

40:57.955 --> 40:59.354
You agree?

41:00.024 --> 41:02.288
(Stone)
You were there, Paul.
You saw her.

41:02.359 --> 41:05.192
I saw a woman protecting
an organization
she believed in.

41:05.296 --> 41:08.129
And she's protecting a man
who killed her husband.

41:08.199 --> 41:11.134
If there's a chance
that she's covering
after the fact,

41:11.202 --> 41:13.898
then she's part of
the conspiracy. Arrest her.

41:13.971 --> 41:15.302
A hunch is evidence?

41:15.372 --> 41:16.361
No.

41:16.707 --> 41:20.473
But maybe a few hours
behind bars,
she'll give us some.

41:21.712 --> 41:23.509
Let me talk to her.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.917
We spent our lives
building the AAC.

41:27.985 --> 41:29.782
You think I'm gonna help
you destroy it?

41:29.854 --> 41:33.187
Am I looking at Coretta King,
or a woman scorned?

41:34.058 --> 41:37.653
Caesar's wife should be pure,
Mr. Robinette, not Caesar.

41:38.062 --> 41:40.326
Otis Cook may have
been involved.

41:40.598 --> 41:42.327
You don't want justice?

41:42.700 --> 41:45.567
I was Michelle Perkins,
16 years old,

41:45.936 --> 41:49.372
dreaming of becoming
a sorority sister
in Alpha Rho at Vassar,

41:49.440 --> 41:52.068
until the President
handed me a mirror.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.837
Maybe you should look
in that mirror

41:53.911 --> 41:55.902
before talking to me
about justice.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.277
[Sighing]
Whoa, whoa.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.839
Wipe away the rhetoric

41:59.917 --> 42:03.717
and all I see is
a woman protecting the man
who killed her husband.

42:03.854 --> 42:06.789
And I see a man
manipulated into turning
on his own people.

42:06.857 --> 42:08.984
My people aren't murderers.

42:09.693 --> 42:12.025
Back of the bus
died a long time ago.

42:12.096 --> 42:13.620
Words on a page.

42:13.697 --> 42:15.130
Look into the hearts
of the men

42:15.199 --> 42:16.826
you drink coffee
with every morning.

42:16.934 --> 42:19.232
That bus has
a long way to go.

42:19.737 --> 42:22.968
Protecting Otis
won't get you there
any quicker.

42:23.440 --> 42:26.432
I will not allow
the tragedy of
my husband's death

42:26.510 --> 42:28.569
to undermine
all that I've done.

42:28.646 --> 42:32.707
If you're right, those men
will receive justice,
but on my terms.

42:35.653 --> 42:37.644
If you withhold evidence,

42:38.155 --> 42:40.817
the law says
you're a co-conspirator.

42:41.358 --> 42:43.918
We do what we have to,
Mr. Robinette.

42:48.198 --> 42:49.961
So it was Otis.

42:50.067 --> 42:51.898
(Robinette)
I checked the police report.

42:51.969 --> 42:54.028
Mrs. Tate said,
Roland Books redirected them

42:54.104 --> 42:56.095
towards the front door
of Nation Hall.

42:56.206 --> 42:59.266
Yeah,
something about the police
blocking the back alley.

42:59.543 --> 43:02.774
I checked with the police.
There were two cars
on the scene.

43:02.846 --> 43:04.108
Both in front.

43:04.181 --> 43:05.944
The question is, why?

43:07.952 --> 43:10.546
Tate was moderating
his politics.

43:11.121 --> 43:12.850
Maybe Books didn't agree.

43:12.990 --> 43:14.753
Books lied. Otis lied.

43:14.892 --> 43:17.360
So they'll never
make Eagle Scout.

43:17.728 --> 43:20.094
You gotta have proof
for a conviction.

43:20.264 --> 43:23.995
You try them, we lose,
hang my picture
next to David Duke's.

43:24.168 --> 43:26.432
No direct evidence, no trial.

43:27.004 --> 43:29.097
So let's get Books
and Otis in here.

43:29.173 --> 43:30.800
We have nothing to
pressure them with.

43:30.941 --> 43:32.568
Mrs. Tate won't talk.

43:32.643 --> 43:34.235
They don't know that.

43:34.511 --> 43:36.775
Talk about hi-tech lynchings.

43:36.880 --> 43:38.609
If they're paying you
by the head, Stone,

43:38.682 --> 43:40.445
don't expect
a paycheck this week.

43:40.517 --> 43:42.212
If that were true,
Mr. Johnson,

43:42.286 --> 43:44.550
I'd be happily out
shopping for a Rolex.

43:47.691 --> 43:51.491
We know that your client
and Otis Cook
killed Marcus Tate,

43:52.329 --> 43:55.025
and I assure you,
we'll put them both in prison.

43:55.132 --> 43:57.157
Marcus Tate was a beacon.

43:57.668 --> 44:01.502
He wasrt blinded by
a thousand points of light.
There was only one.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.436
And you want it
shining on you.

44:03.507 --> 44:07.341
The mere fact that we're here
means you don't have
enough to convict.

44:07.444 --> 44:09.810
If you're looking
for a confession, Counselor,

44:09.880 --> 44:12.644
you better clean
your bifocals.
It's not coming.

44:12.716 --> 44:15.344
Maybe not from
your side of the table.

44:15.452 --> 44:16.612
You lied about Koblin.

44:16.687 --> 44:18.086
Maybe I got a bad memory.

44:18.155 --> 44:20.055
(Robinette)
Lt'll buy you
a couple in Attica

44:20.124 --> 44:21.352
for perjury and obstruction.

44:21.425 --> 44:22.653
That's just the beginning.

44:22.726 --> 44:25.388
You're implying that my client
was somehow involved in this?

44:25.462 --> 44:27.225
I'm saying
he pulled the trigger.

44:27.564 --> 44:29.293
He talks to me about Books,
and...

44:29.366 --> 44:31.926
Why don't you go
prosecute a jaywalker?

44:33.070 --> 44:34.833
Life's tough, Otis.

44:35.005 --> 44:36.802
It's a lot tougher
when you're stupid.

44:37.541 --> 44:40.806
Books sold out Tate.
You think he's gonna think
twice about you?

44:41.545 --> 44:43.445
I didn't kill the man.

44:44.048 --> 44:46.710
You can squeeze
as hard as you want, brother.

44:46.817 --> 44:48.648
You'll get nothing.

44:49.787 --> 44:51.414
We know that Otis lied.

44:51.488 --> 44:54.787
He was merely putting nails
in Koblirs coffin.

44:54.858 --> 44:56.883
The man did kill Marcus.

44:57.361 --> 44:59.522
That's not what
the jury thought.

45:00.030 --> 45:02.498
Otis wanted justice.
The system has seams,

45:02.566 --> 45:04.830
he feared it.
And you proved him right.

45:05.703 --> 45:08.001
Mitchell Koblin was acquitted

45:08.238 --> 45:10.399
because we couldn't
link his gun.

45:10.708 --> 45:13.233
And what if
Mitchell Koblin was black?

45:13.544 --> 45:17.674
You think your precious jury
would have overlooked
the missing bullet?

45:17.815 --> 45:21.342
Mr. Stone, please,
I'm not ignorant.

45:21.418 --> 45:23.010
I can see what you're doing.

45:23.087 --> 45:25.351
It's CYA time.
You couldn't convict Koblin

45:25.422 --> 45:28.482
so you need scapegoats,
preferably black ones.

45:28.792 --> 45:31.556
Maybe he was acquitted
because he was innocent.

45:33.697 --> 45:36.757
Mr. Lowenthal
painted a sexy picture,

45:37.668 --> 45:41.195
a coup d'etat in front
of hundreds of people
and a bevy of cops.

45:41.271 --> 45:43.102
The jury bought it
because they wanted to,

45:43.173 --> 45:45.232
because the idea of
a lone gunman

45:45.442 --> 45:48.741
that can assassinate a leader
rocks the comfort zone.

45:49.246 --> 45:51.737
And a conspiracy
is more palatable?

45:52.015 --> 45:54.040
Hollywood puts out a film

45:54.618 --> 45:57.109
based on nothing, on hearsay,

45:57.287 --> 46:00.745
and it grosses hundreds of
millions of dollars.

46:04.528 --> 46:06.758
Go ahead, Mr. Stone,
prosecute me.

46:06.964 --> 46:08.989
Maybe the world will sleep
a little better for it,

46:09.066 --> 46:11.034
but you won't get
a conviction.

46:11.101 --> 46:12.591
We both know that.
