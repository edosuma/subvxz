[crickets chirping]

00:40.507 --> 00:45.342
[slowly building
orchestral music playing]

01:03.280 --> 01:05.271
[russ solomon] way back when,

01:05.574 --> 01:10.068
when young teenagers had
a collection of 45 rpm records,

01:12.289 --> 01:14.325
to me that was
kind of exciting.

01:14.624 --> 01:15.864
that was almost better
than having

01:16.167 --> 01:17.156
a big collection of cds,

01:17.460 --> 01:19.576
albums, and everything else.

01:19.880 --> 01:23.748
but imagine, 45 records,
45 rpm records

01:25.302 --> 01:29.966
a better quality
and less breakable than the 78

01:30.265 --> 01:32.176
of ten years before,

01:32.475 --> 01:35.763
but with all the music
you ever wanted.

01:36.062 --> 01:38.678
and you could carry it around
in a little box.

01:42.027 --> 01:43.642
that's what Tower was about.

01:43.945 --> 01:45.310
believe me.

01:49.868 --> 01:52.029
it was the music
that was meaningful

01:52.329 --> 01:53.819
to young people's lives.

02:01.713 --> 02:03.203
and we were how they got it.

02:03.506 --> 02:06.293
[dramatic string music playing]

02:18.605 --> 02:20.345
the first record
I ever bought was

02:20.649 --> 02:24.062
Bob Wills,
New San Antone rose.

02:24.361 --> 02:25.567
it was like 35 cents.

02:25.862 --> 02:29.650
[big band music playing]

02:39.125 --> 02:43.164
the year was 1941,
and my dad had a drug store

02:43.463 --> 02:44.703
called Tower drugs.

02:45.006 --> 02:46.291
it was in
the Tower theater building.

02:46.591 --> 02:47.797
the drugstore was tiny,

02:48.093 --> 02:49.958
and yet they had
everything in there.

02:50.261 --> 02:52.843
he had toys, he had liquor,
he had magazines,

02:53.139 --> 02:56.506
cigarettes, perfume,
cosmetics, candy,

02:56.810 --> 02:58.141
heh, you name it.

03:02.482 --> 03:05.098
so we had a soda fountain
in that store as well,

03:05.402 --> 03:07.814
and on the soda fountain
we had the jukebox.

03:08.113 --> 03:11.526
one day, my dad said,
"why don't we sell
used records?"

03:11.825 --> 03:13.065
he asked the jukebox
operator bring in

03:13.368 --> 03:15.199
his used records,
which he brought in

03:15.495 --> 03:17.702
and sold us the records
for three cents

03:17.998 --> 03:20.080
and we turned round
and sold them for a dime.

03:20.375 --> 03:22.616
we sold 'em out right away,
so my dad said,

03:22.919 --> 03:24.250
"if we can sell used records,

03:24.546 --> 03:26.082
we ought to be able
to sell new records."

03:26.381 --> 03:28.167
went in to san francisco
where you could buy

03:28.466 --> 03:29.501
all the records wholesale.

03:29.801 --> 03:31.757
200 records cost about

03:32.053 --> 03:33.839
less than a couple
a hundred bucks. [chuckles]

03:34.139 --> 03:36.095
so we said, "fine,
we'll spend the 200 dollars,

03:36.391 --> 03:37.676
give us a franchise,"

03:37.976 --> 03:39.591
and bang,
we're in the record business.

03:39.894 --> 03:44.638
[big band music playing]

03:49.237 --> 03:52.195
during that period,
my dad actually broke th rough

03:52.490 --> 03:55.823
the wall of the drugstore
into the empty space next door,

03:56.119 --> 03:57.859
a little empty storefront,
and he said,

03:58.163 --> 03:59.778
"we'll put the record
department back th ere."

04:00.081 --> 04:02.493
so we decided to call it
Tower Record Mart.

04:02.792 --> 04:06.080
he couldn't complain too much
because he was getting
some free labor,

04:06.379 --> 04:08.244
but at the same time,
he didn't like the idea

04:08.548 --> 04:09.583
that I should've been in school.

04:12.302 --> 04:16.261
and we realized
right off the bat
that this was a big deal.

04:16.555 --> 04:18.716
I went to my dad, I said,
"well, I want to expand.

04:19.017 --> 04:20.848
I want to go in to this
rack-jobbing business,

04:21.144 --> 04:23.305
expand our jukebox,
and get this and that. "

04:23.605 --> 04:25.561
all kinds of wonderful things
I wanted to do.

04:25.857 --> 04:29.190
he says:
"no way, absolutely, no way.

04:29.486 --> 04:30.692
" don't bother me.

04:30.987 --> 04:32.443
"you want this thing,

04:32.739 --> 04:34.479
"you buy
the record store from me,

04:34.783 --> 04:37.149
and then you do what you want,
but i'm not financing it."

04:37.452 --> 04:38.817
I said, "all right."

04:39.120 --> 04:40.826
he says: "fine,
it's yours tomorrow,

04:41.122 --> 04:42.328
"and here's the deal:

04:42.624 --> 04:44.239
"you have the inventory

04:44.542 --> 04:46.453
and you have the bills that
the company owes, goodbye."

04:46.753 --> 04:47.959
[chuckles]

04:48.254 --> 04:51.337
and overnight,
I was the owner of this thing.

04:56.179 --> 04:58.215
everything he did
influenced me.

04:58.515 --> 05:02.554
it's, how do you say,
that one imparts

05:02.852 --> 05:05.935
a whole style of life

05:06.231 --> 05:09.018
just by being close to you

05:09.317 --> 05:10.432
and you pick it up

05:10.735 --> 05:12.271
[mike solomon]
he was a skinny guy

05:12.570 --> 05:13.730
who liked to have
a lot of fun,

05:14.030 --> 05:15.440
loved music, loved dancing.

05:15.740 --> 05:17.401
there was always music on
in our house.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.031
it seems like every evening

05:19.327 --> 05:22.740
my parents were dancing
and partying.

05:23.039 --> 05:24.495
i'm sure there was
some drinking.

05:24.791 --> 05:27.624
I probably started
when I was five years old.

05:27.919 --> 05:29.284
I would go in to work with him

05:29.587 --> 05:31.418
and sort singles.

05:31.714 --> 05:35.081
it was quite a family affair,
so my mother would be there.

05:35.385 --> 05:38.047
I think she was doing
the bookkeeping at that time.

05:38.346 --> 05:41.304
my father had a fantasy
and a dream

05:41.599 --> 05:46.184
and a desire to open up
a supermarket of records.

05:46.479 --> 05:50.017
he then opened a record store
at watt and el camino,

05:50.316 --> 05:51.556
it was a tiny little store,

05:51.860 --> 05:53.396
about a thousand
square feet, maybe.

05:53.695 --> 05:56.107
[russ]my wonderful friend
who had been doing advertising

05:56.406 --> 05:58.067
for the drugstore,
mick mickelson,

05:58.366 --> 05:59.947
he said, "well,
we're changing your name.

06:00.243 --> 06:01.824
"Tower Record mart,
that's too...

06:02.120 --> 06:03.781
"we're going to call it
Tower Records

06:04.080 --> 06:07.163
"and we're going to use
shell oil company colors.

06:07.458 --> 06:10.245
"and i'm going to design
a letter that'll stand out,

06:10.545 --> 06:12.081
that nobody's
ever seen before."

06:12.380 --> 06:14.746
and he literally,
drew that letter.

06:15.049 --> 06:17.961
you know, in sacramento
there weren't very many places
for kids to hang out.

06:18.261 --> 06:20.047
there was, like downtown,
there was places,

06:22.515 --> 06:23.846
so it was, you know,

06:24.142 --> 06:25.598
Tower books and records
were in like this parking lot

06:25.894 --> 06:27.304
surrounded by nothing.

06:27.604 --> 06:29.890
and for kids in high school,
that's what you did.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.555
you know,
you went to Tower Records.

06:34.819 --> 06:36.480
[Heidi Cotler] it was
the beginning of the folk era,

06:36.779 --> 06:38.315
and so we would sit
in the parking lot at Tower

06:38.615 --> 06:40.321
on our little sports cars
and play music.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.573
so the guitar guys would come,
and the banjo guys would come,

06:42.869 --> 06:45.110
and we'd play music
in front of the record store

06:45.413 --> 06:47.404
and then you'd go
into the record store
and into the listening booths

06:47.707 --> 06:49.072
and listen
to as much as you could

06:49.375 --> 06:51.616
because you couldn't
afford to buy any records.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.251
.p walk right in .p

06:53.546 --> 06:55.127
.p sit right down .p

06:55.423 --> 06:58.836
I daddy let your mind
go long... .p

06:59.135 --> 07:02.093
there were make out sessions
in the listening booths,

07:02.388 --> 07:03.878
people had sex
in listening booths.

07:04.182 --> 07:05.763
we put really big lights
in there

07:06.059 --> 07:07.845
so they'd be
as hot as possible

07:08.144 --> 07:09.884
so that you couldn't stay
in there too long.

07:10.188 --> 07:14.022
jÂ‘ do you want
to lose your mind... i

07:14.317 --> 07:16.933
this store opened in 1961,
I was eleven years old,

07:17.237 --> 07:18.693
it was the only place I knew.

07:18.988 --> 07:20.569
you'd walk down the aisle
and you could just see

07:20.865 --> 07:22.776
from the front of the store
to the back of that aisle,

07:23.076 --> 07:24.782
just these stacks of lps.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.864
you know, somebody came up
with that terminology,

07:27.163 --> 07:28.778
stack 'em high and sell 'em low.

07:29.082 --> 07:32.040
yeah, the managers
and the employees were young,

07:32.335 --> 07:35.168
they loved music,
they were enjoying themselves.

07:35.463 --> 07:38.705
they were having a lot of fun,
which was a good thing,

07:39.008 --> 07:40.714
because they weren't
getting paid very much.

07:41.010 --> 07:42.966
and that was the beginning
of Tower Records.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.754
jÂ” daddy let
your mind go long. .p

07:46.933 --> 07:49.049
I worked for Tower for 37 years.

07:49.352 --> 07:52.219
I started
when I was 19 years old,

07:52.522 --> 07:55.059
and it started out
at the watt avenue store.

07:55.358 --> 07:57.314
[russ]stan was this kid
that was the son

07:57.610 --> 08:00.397
of one of the pharmacists
that worked for my father.

08:00.697 --> 08:03.655
he came to work and he said,
"you gotta give the kid a job."

08:03.950 --> 08:04.939
I said, "okay, put him to work."

08:05.243 --> 08:06.824
I walked out
in to the watts store,

08:07.120 --> 08:10.988
and this guy george horton
came running up to the counter

08:11.291 --> 08:13.748
and looked at me and goes,
"who are you?" and I go,

08:14.043 --> 08:16.910
"oh, uh, i'm the new guy.
my name's stan, how are ya?"

08:17.213 --> 08:20.831
and he says,
"oh, great, you're here.

08:21.134 --> 08:21.998
charlie and i
are going to lunch."

08:22.302 --> 08:23.792
and I went, "okay."

08:24.095 --> 08:26.381
he says,
"good, everything's $3.88

08:26.681 --> 08:29.548
" except for frank sinatra,
phase four, and command.

08:29.851 --> 08:31.682
"that's $4.88, see ya later.

08:31.978 --> 08:34.309
we'll be back in an hour."
[chuckles]

08:34.605 --> 08:36.687
and there I was,
that was my training.

08:36.982 --> 08:39.315
[Stan] Tower was like
the place to work at

08:39.610 --> 08:41.145
because it was so open.

08:41.446 --> 08:43.857
plus, you could play whatever
you want on the record player,

08:44.157 --> 08:45.988
so you could be
an amateur dj, too,

08:46.284 --> 08:49.617
and it was definitely
the place to work.

08:49.912 --> 08:51.777
what happened
in the very early '603,

08:52.081 --> 08:54.914
'63, '64,
was a couple of artists

08:55.209 --> 08:58.497
happened on the scene
that just changed
the world around.

08:58.796 --> 08:59.831
<i>let's go surfin' now</i>

09:00.131 --> 09:01.371
<i>everybody's learning how</i>

09:01.674 --> 09:04.336
<i>come on and safari with me</i>

09:04.635 --> 09:06.375
i come on and safari
with me....p

09:06.679 --> 09:08.169
[russ] when the beach boys'
early album

09:08.473 --> 09:09.883
surfin' safaricame out,

09:10.183 --> 09:11.639
all of a sudden,
the business kind of shifted

09:11.934 --> 09:14.767
from a singles business
to a lp business.

09:15.063 --> 09:16.223
then, of course,
throughout the '6os

09:16.522 --> 09:18.513
as the baby boomers
kind of came of age

09:18.816 --> 09:21.478
and there started being more
and more potential buyers
of these records.

09:21.778 --> 09:24.645
the great thing
for the record industry
was that they cost a lot more.

09:24.947 --> 09:26.733
so instead of spending 49 cents

09:27.033 --> 09:28.773
or whatever it was
on a single back then,

09:29.077 --> 09:31.363
people were spending
$3.99 or $4.99

09:31.662 --> 09:33.198
or $5.99 on an album.

09:33.498 --> 09:35.739
[russ]we could literally sell
a thousand copies of a record

09:36.042 --> 09:38.078
over a weekend,
or something like that,

09:38.378 --> 09:39.914
which was incredible.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.794
the hits began to sell
in quantity,

09:42.090 --> 09:44.206
the kids came in more and more,

09:44.509 --> 09:45.715
they grew up with it,

09:46.010 --> 09:47.966
they widened their taste
in music.

09:48.262 --> 09:50.799
by the late '6os,
radio began to explore

09:51.099 --> 09:52.509
something besides top 40.

09:52.809 --> 09:56.552
you had these really
free form radio stations.

09:56.854 --> 10:00.187
they were changing the way
that everybody looked at music,

10:00.483 --> 10:01.768
and we just rode that wave.

10:02.068 --> 10:03.308
.p let's go surfin' now .p

10:03.611 --> 10:04.896
.p everybody's learnin' how i

10:05.196 --> 10:08.029
i come on and safari with me i

10:08.324 --> 10:09.814
i come on and safari
with me...i

10:10.118 --> 10:11.528
[steve knopper]
but as the '603 went on,

10:11.828 --> 10:13.068
you had one lp after another

10:13.371 --> 10:15.282
that was a huge
artistic statement.

10:15.581 --> 10:18.163
sergeant pepper and pet sounds
and on and on and on.

10:18.459 --> 10:19.824
then suddenly,
you started to have

10:20.128 --> 10:22.039
more and more cash coming
in to the record industry.

10:22.338 --> 10:24.249
and that was exactly the time

10:24.549 --> 10:26.164
that Tower Records
really started to peak

10:26.467 --> 10:29.209
in that first wave
where russ had opened his store.

10:29.512 --> 10:30.968
[mike]well, he would
talk about it all the time,

10:31.264 --> 10:33.425
how important it was
to have a big inventory,

10:33.724 --> 10:38.218
and how he wanted to open up
a very big store.

10:38.521 --> 10:42.434
the largest store
in the world in a big city.

10:45.361 --> 10:47.727
she was pretty. I wish
i could remember her name.

10:48.030 --> 10:51.739
she was a manicurist
at a barbershop that
i used to go to,

10:52.034 --> 10:57.028
and I just
accidentally ran into her
in a bar in sacramento,

10:57.331 --> 11:00.164
sitting there and saying,
"why don't we take a trip?

11:00.460 --> 11:02.041
why don't we go to san
francisco?" and she says, "yes."

11:02.336 --> 11:03.872
so off to san francisco
we went.

11:04.172 --> 11:06.663
i mean, this was early,
like five o'clock or so

11:06.966 --> 11:08.456
in the afternoon.

11:08.759 --> 11:10.374
an hour and a half later,
we're in san francisco

11:10.678 --> 11:13.044
having dinner and drinks,
and dinner and drinks,

11:13.347 --> 11:16.089
and dinner and drinks,
and a little jazz.

11:16.392 --> 11:18.804
getting pretty drunk,
as a matter of fact.

11:19.103 --> 11:21.059
later on ending up at a hotel.

11:21.355 --> 11:22.891
and the next morning,

11:23.191 --> 11:25.022
i was hung over, badly,

11:25.318 --> 11:26.603
and had to do something

11:26.903 --> 11:30.395
about trying to get well
to drive back to sacramento.

11:30.698 --> 11:34.691
so we went down to a drive-in
at columbus and bay.

11:34.994 --> 11:37.952
i could get a nice greasy
breakfast and a lot of coffee,

11:38.247 --> 11:39.612
so went in there

11:39.916 --> 11:42.999
and i'm sitting in there
with this awful hangover

11:43.294 --> 11:45.250
and I looked across the street,

11:45.546 --> 11:48.788
and there was this
empty building.

11:49.091 --> 11:51.924
and a big sign on it
that said, " for lease."

11:52.220 --> 11:54.711
the only thing that looked
alive on that property

11:55.014 --> 11:56.299
was a telephone booth.

11:56.599 --> 11:57.884
i went over to that
telephone booth

11:58.184 --> 11:59.890
and I called the number
on the sign,

12:00.186 --> 12:02.222
and I said,
"you want to rent this place?"

12:02.522 --> 12:03.978
the guy said, "love to."

12:04.273 --> 12:06.013
and I made a deal,
just like that.

12:06.317 --> 12:09.480
['6os music playing]

12:12.657 --> 12:14.818
it actually was
this huge building,

12:15.117 --> 12:17.199
and the record company
people said,

12:17.495 --> 12:20.077
"where are you going
to put the refrigerators and the
washing machines and stoves?"

12:20.373 --> 12:22.159
and he said,
"it's all going to be records."

12:22.458 --> 12:25.120
and they said,
"okay, you know what?
this is such an insane idea,

12:25.419 --> 12:28.001
that you'll be
gone in three months.
we're going to back you."

12:28.297 --> 12:30.037
so he basically opened
that whole san francisco store

12:30.341 --> 12:32.878
on nothing more
than the record company's money.

12:33.177 --> 12:34.337
[russ]luckily, my cousin ross

12:34.637 --> 12:37.174
was a builder,
electrical, carpentry,

12:37.473 --> 12:39.759
and so he volunteered,
"oh, i'll go down
and fix it up.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.219
put some lighting in there.

12:41.519 --> 12:42.929
put a new floor in,
and paint it. "

12:43.229 --> 12:44.139
and that was it.

12:44.438 --> 12:45.769
he went and did it.

12:46.065 --> 12:48.147
there was no way we could,
you know, heh,

12:48.442 --> 12:51.275
afford a neon sign
or anything like that.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.732
so we opened a store,

12:54.031 --> 12:57.398
and it just takes off like,
like a rocket.

13:01.247 --> 13:03.033
i mean, the day the place
opened up,

13:03.332 --> 13:06.244
people are swarming
in there, literally.

13:06.544 --> 13:08.580
there's a picture around
of me standing there

13:08.879 --> 13:10.540
with these people
all over the place.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.125
it was unbelievable.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.006
[david geffen]if you go
to san francisco,

13:14.302 --> 13:15.963
be sure to where
flowers in your hair.

13:16.262 --> 13:18.127
i mean, you know
you walked through
the streets of san francisco

13:18.431 --> 13:20.171
and there were
people smoking pot

13:20.474 --> 13:22.055
and having little
daisies in their hair

13:22.351 --> 13:24.433
and hanging out,
and the fillmore was packed,

13:24.729 --> 13:26.265
and, you know, it was a change.

13:26.564 --> 13:29.601
people were against the war,
and against segregation,

13:29.900 --> 13:32.266
and there was a lot of
political feeling in the world,

13:32.570 --> 13:34.435
and a lot of it was
centered in the change

13:34.739 --> 13:36.650
that was happening
in san francisco

13:36.949 --> 13:40.612
and that's the cauldron
in which Tower Records was born.

13:40.911 --> 13:43.698
[russ] so consequently,
there were people pouring
into san francisco

13:43.998 --> 13:46.205
from all over
northern california,

13:46.500 --> 13:47.831
and for that matter,
all over the world,

13:48.127 --> 13:50.209
to experience
what could be called

13:50.504 --> 13:52.210
the hippie kind of movement,
if you will,

13:52.506 --> 13:55.043
but mostly the music movement
that was happening down there.

13:55.343 --> 13:56.879
all the san francisco bands

13:57.178 --> 13:58.884
and the new music,
and so many of the people

13:59.180 --> 14:02.172
who went in to be entertained
by the music in san francisco,

14:02.475 --> 14:04.136
wanted to know
where that music came from.

14:04.435 --> 14:06.642
they want to know
the roots of that music.

14:06.937 --> 14:09.178
i like a sound you hear
that lingers in your ear i

14:09.482 --> 14:13.896
i but you can't forget
from sundown to sunset i

14:14.195 --> 14:16.652
i now now i

14:16.947 --> 14:19.188
i it's all in the air
you hear it everywhere i

14:19.492 --> 14:25.078
i and no matter what you do
it's going to grab
a hold on you i

14:25.373 --> 14:27.989
i california soul i

14:28.292 --> 14:31.079
[mike]what was particularly
unique about that store

14:31.379 --> 14:33.085
was how much music it had.

14:33.381 --> 14:34.666
customers were so excited,

14:34.965 --> 14:36.546
you could almost see
their eyes light up

14:36.842 --> 14:39.128
well, I think the inventory
made a big difference,

14:39.428 --> 14:42.420
because they wanted
everything to begin with.

14:42.723 --> 14:46.181
i whistles a mellow beat i

14:46.477 --> 14:51.141
i so the people
started to sing i

14:51.440 --> 14:53.226
the thing that was amazing to me

14:53.526 --> 14:55.357
was just the sheer...

14:55.653 --> 14:59.316
like, almost seemed like
an unlimited types of music.

14:59.615 --> 15:02.732
things like spoken word
and comedy and sound effects

15:03.035 --> 15:06.243
and international and jazz,
trend jazz, big band,

15:06.539 --> 15:07.824
i mean, it was unbelievable.

15:08.124 --> 15:09.580
Tower wasn't just a group
of departments,

15:09.875 --> 15:12.457
it was a group of little stores
within one roof,

15:12.753 --> 15:15.210
i mean, there was a jazz store,
there was a classical store,

15:15.506 --> 15:17.212
and you got to know
those people,

15:17.508 --> 15:19.464
they got to know your tastes,
you got to know theirs,

15:19.760 --> 15:21.375
that's how you learned
about music,

15:21.679 --> 15:24.512
and that's also what
brought you back into the store.

15:24.807 --> 15:26.923
[russ]all of a sudden,
it would become fashionable

15:27.226 --> 15:29.182
for those young people
to find something

15:29.478 --> 15:31.218
that they want
to hold in their hand,

15:31.522 --> 15:35.014
that they want to collect,
that it's hip to collect,

15:35.317 --> 15:36.477
that has music on it.

15:36.777 --> 15:39.063
well, first,
there was the thrill

15:39.363 --> 15:42.571
of being surrounded by music.

15:42.867 --> 15:45.700
80 percent of it
is a complete mystery to you.

15:45.995 --> 15:48.532
so when we came west,
we were shocked

15:48.831 --> 15:51.948
at the size of Tower Records,
and simply,

15:52.251 --> 15:55.835
how many records there were.
[chuckles]

15:56.130 --> 15:59.873
everybody in a record store
is a little bit of your friend

16:00.176 --> 16:03.213
for twenty minutes or so,
you know? [chuckles]

16:03.512 --> 16:07.676
so there was that family aspect
of a real record store.

16:07.975 --> 16:09.840
it started out as a small family

16:10.144 --> 16:12.135
here in sacramento
with just a few of us

16:12.438 --> 16:15.225
and as time went on,
the company got bigger
and bigger and bigger,

16:15.524 --> 16:17.515
it just became a bigger
and bigger family.

16:17.818 --> 16:19.558
[heidi]it was
my second year in college

16:19.862 --> 16:21.773
and I didn't like college.
i was moving out of the house

16:22.072 --> 16:23.482
and I decided
i needed to get a job.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.398
i wanted to go some place
and make some money.

16:25.701 --> 16:27.737
i applied for the record store
on watt avenue.

16:28.037 --> 16:29.573
they weren't hiring girls
that year,

16:29.872 --> 16:31.737
they'd already had one
and she hadn't worked out.

16:32.041 --> 16:33.952
so th ese two gentlemen that
were running the bookstore,

16:34.251 --> 16:35.866
and the bookstore opened
in '62,

16:36.170 --> 16:38.001
so it had only
been open for three years.

16:38.297 --> 16:41.130
they wouldn't let us
wear pants, either.
we had to wear skirts.

16:41.425 --> 16:43.040
so they could, of course,
look up our skirts.

16:43.344 --> 16:44.800
[russ]heidi was a girl
that worked for me

16:45.095 --> 16:47.131
in the book division,
in the bookstore,

16:47.431 --> 16:49.672
the very first bookstore
in sacramento.

16:49.975 --> 16:52.387
[heidi]he walks into the store
and the first thing he sees
in this bookstore

16:52.686 --> 16:54.426
is this woman
in leopard skin underwear

16:54.730 --> 16:57.016
and a mini skirt
hanging desiderata posters,

16:57.316 --> 16:58.806
and that was me.

16:59.109 --> 17:02.567
i showed up, and I wasn't
a weenie, and I worked hard,

17:02.863 --> 17:05.194
and I wasn't going
to be put down.

17:05.491 --> 17:08.324
and learned how to swear,
and learned how to drink,

17:08.618 --> 17:10.483
i learned how to do drugs.
[laughs]

17:10.788 --> 17:13.154
[mark viducich]
i think we were with
some friends one afternoon,

17:13.457 --> 17:15.038
it was late evening,

17:15.334 --> 17:17.494
honest to god I think we stole
a couple of records from Tower,

17:17.795 --> 17:19.251
and it wasn't the
last one I ever took

17:19.547 --> 17:21.287
after I started working there,
of course,

17:21.589 --> 17:22.704
but it was fun.

17:23.008 --> 17:24.589
first day,
i think I went to el chico,

17:24.885 --> 17:26.590
which was the local bar
down the street,

17:26.887 --> 17:29.378
probably spent three hours
at lunch having a few cocktails

17:29.682 --> 17:31.047
and came back to work.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.386
that's pretty much how
it went for a long time.

17:33.686 --> 17:37.019
mark is crazy,
he's totally nuts.

17:37.314 --> 17:38.645
but he could do anything.

17:38.941 --> 17:40.477
viducich, sid vicious,
we called him sid vicious

17:40.776 --> 17:42.732
because he was the nastiest
mother on the planet.

17:43.028 --> 17:45.735
you know he could ream your ass
like nobody's business.

17:46.031 --> 17:47.521
i'll go drink
whenever the hell I want,

17:47.825 --> 17:49.315
and please don't ever
talk to me that way again.

17:49.618 --> 17:51.404
no, there was nothing like that.

17:51.704 --> 17:52.910
course it helped
that your best friend

17:53.205 --> 17:54.490
was the manager
of the store, too.

17:54.790 --> 17:57.247
my dad and russ
are first cousins.

17:57.543 --> 18:01.627
my father actually ran the cafe
at the Tower drugstore.

18:01.922 --> 18:04.254
and so that's where the
connection is with Tower drugs.

18:04.550 --> 18:08.168
so my father actually ended up
working at Tower Records too.

18:08.470 --> 18:11.337
he did store development
for russ for many years,

18:11.640 --> 18:14.757
so when we built new stores,
my father, ross,

18:15.060 --> 18:16.596
was the person who built
those stores,

18:16.896 --> 18:18.887
so obviously,
it was easy for me to get a job

18:19.189 --> 18:21.350
working at Tower
when I got out of high school.

18:21.650 --> 18:22.639
i went to work
for the book division

18:22.943 --> 18:26.026
as a clerk and then advertising.

18:26.322 --> 18:28.438
so I ran the advertising
for the book division.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.277
then I went into
community relations,

18:30.576 --> 18:32.737
and bringing in authors
for book signings.

18:33.037 --> 18:36.200
virtually everyone in the
company started off as a clerk.

18:36.498 --> 18:38.454
they'd become buyers,
they'd become

18:38.751 --> 18:41.288
supervisor types
in the store.

18:41.587 --> 18:44.294
th ey'd become assistant managers
and then they'd become managers,

18:44.590 --> 18:46.296
so they learn everything
they need to learn.

18:46.592 --> 18:49.925
and the entire development
of Tower Records

18:50.220 --> 18:53.508
through the entire period
of time it existed

18:53.807 --> 18:55.547
was just that kind of a thing.

18:55.851 --> 18:57.466
[heidi]as a woman,
i just said,

18:57.770 --> 18:59.055
"i'm not even going to think
about being a woman."

18:59.355 --> 19:01.095
there're no excuses,
no period stuff.

19:01.398 --> 19:03.980
I mean, I went in to labor
twice behind the counter.

19:04.276 --> 19:07.484
because I was determined
to be treated as an equal,

19:07.780 --> 19:09.520
because I was
the first female hired,

19:09.823 --> 19:11.484
I was the first
female vice president,

19:11.784 --> 19:12.864
I was the first female
general manager,

19:13.160 --> 19:14.366
I was the first manager,

19:14.662 --> 19:17.620
so I unknowingly
had this responsibility

19:17.915 --> 19:19.325
to be kind of the mentor

19:19.625 --> 19:21.616
for these women
coming up behind me.

19:21.919 --> 19:24.626
[russ]
it isn't what we as a company
could teach our employees,

19:24.922 --> 19:27.789
but what other employees
could teach each other.

19:28.092 --> 19:31.801
that family kind of thing
is what made the company grow,

19:32.096 --> 19:33.711
and what made
the company successful.

19:34.014 --> 19:35.550
i'm convinced of that.

19:35.849 --> 19:37.760
that's my old tom sawyer
theory of management.

19:38.060 --> 19:39.641
let somebody else
paint the fence.

19:39.937 --> 19:42.019
but we had the freedom to do
whatever we wanted,

19:42.314 --> 19:45.101
I mean he literally
gave us these stores
with all this product in it,

19:45.401 --> 19:49.735
and said, "okay, show up,
do the job right,

19:50.030 --> 19:52.521
don't screw me over."
and then left us alone.

19:52.825 --> 19:55.282
one key to the success
of Tower Records,

19:55.577 --> 19:57.192
particularly in that period,

19:57.496 --> 19:58.656
is we had no dress code.

19:58.956 --> 20:00.912
I really believe
that a lot of people

20:01.208 --> 20:04.200
wanted to come to work for us,
young people especially,

20:04.503 --> 20:07.165
so they wouldn't have
to be told how to dress.

20:07.464 --> 20:09.295
[Ken Sockolov] The people
who worked at Tower

20:09.591 --> 20:11.297
were musicians
in many cases.

20:11.593 --> 20:13.129
[Dave Grohl]
I got a job at Tower Records

20:13.429 --> 20:16.136
because that's the only place
I could get a job

20:16.432 --> 20:18.468
with my fucking haircut.

20:18.767 --> 20:20.883
that is the truth.
[chuckles]

20:21.186 --> 20:23.393
I love Tower Records,
and I love music,

20:23.689 --> 20:26.931
and I only wanted
to work at Tower Records

20:27.234 --> 20:30.897
and be surrounded
by these cool people
and all this cool music.

20:31.196 --> 20:32.936
I just imagined
that everybody that worked

20:33.240 --> 20:34.730
at Tower
was like an aficionado.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.241
they didn't necessarily have
any other kind of skills,

20:37.536 --> 20:42.030
sometimes even people skills,
but they had musical knowledge.

20:42.332 --> 20:44.869
every music store,
whether it was a place
to go buy drumsticks,

20:45.169 --> 20:46.579
or a place to go buy records,

20:46.879 --> 20:49.586
were total snobs, total snobs.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.088
the record store
especially was,

20:51.383 --> 20:53.544
had a reputation of
being incredibly rude.

20:53.844 --> 20:55.380
and fuck you if you
can't take a joke.

20:55.679 --> 20:58.921
so, heh, it was more of
a battlefield to get music,

20:59.224 --> 21:01.931
to get records out of
the store in the earlier days.

21:02.227 --> 21:04.013
[stan]
when we opened up at sunset,

21:04.313 --> 21:07.350
that, I feel,
really put us on the mar

21:10.235 --> 21:13.978
larry carp called russ,
"you gotta see this location.
the best thing in the world."

21:14.281 --> 21:15.942
and he goes down there,

21:16.241 --> 21:18.232
and it was
a mad man muntz location,

21:18.535 --> 21:21.993
where you could get
a four track player
installed in your car

21:22.289 --> 21:24.029
right at the corner
of sunset and horn.

21:24.333 --> 21:26.540
[russ]it was 4,000 bucks
a month for a land lease.

21:26.835 --> 21:28.450
that meant I had
to build a building.

21:28.754 --> 21:31.461
so my cousin ross
comes to the rescue again,

21:31.757 --> 21:34.715
and he says,
"all right, we'll just build
a building on there."

21:35.010 --> 21:36.341
I said, "okay, do it."

21:36.637 --> 21:39.003
[stan]it was
the first building we built.

21:39.306 --> 21:41.592
[russ]it was
a pre-fab building
that's still standing

21:41.892 --> 21:43.223
forty years later,
fifty years later,

21:43.519 --> 21:44.599
whatever it is.

21:44.895 --> 21:46.476
[stan]it was a concrete slab,

21:46.772 --> 21:49.855
and then these metal girders
that went up and over

21:50.150 --> 21:53.358
filled in with concrete
block and glass,

21:53.654 --> 21:56.236
and an orange tile floor.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.614
and some counters, that was it.
I laid the floor

21:58.909 --> 22:00.991
at Tower Sunset,
with these two hands.

22:01.286 --> 22:05.950
ross built that building,
the entire project for $75,000.

22:06.250 --> 22:07.740
nobody else would do that.

22:08.043 --> 22:09.624
you know, they have
the whole process

22:09.920 --> 22:11.035
of getting the store ready,

22:11.338 --> 22:12.794
then getting the racks
put together,

22:13.090 --> 22:15.672
and getting the merchandise
put in and so on.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.754
stan was there
from the beginning.

22:18.053 --> 22:20.669
I would come home
from working all day,

22:20.973 --> 22:22.964
which really was
digging ditches

22:23.267 --> 22:25.849
and laying floors,
and getting all sweaty,

22:26.145 --> 22:27.806
but the nice thing was,
record companies would come by

22:28.105 --> 22:29.811
and drop off promos
every once in a while,

22:30.107 --> 22:32.018
and when i'd get home,
i'd have some new records.

22:32.317 --> 22:35.980
well, I just saw
this guy schlepping albums up,

22:36.280 --> 22:37.770
a good twelve steps
to his level,

22:38.073 --> 22:40.314
and then it was
even farther to mine,

22:40.617 --> 22:43.575
but I just saw him,
and i'm a very friendly guy,

22:43.871 --> 22:46.032
and just went down and said,
"hi, i'm your neighbor."

22:46.331 --> 22:49.949
and bob would come down
from his apartment

22:50.252 --> 22:52.368
to check out, see if I had
any new promos.

22:52.671 --> 22:55.037
he was really nice,
he was very open to me,

22:55.340 --> 22:59.583
I didn't know him,
but we became very good friends.

22:59.887 --> 23:01.969
[stan]i'll never forget,
one day I came home

23:02.264 --> 23:04.050
and my front door was open,

23:04.349 --> 23:05.805
and I thought,
"well, that's odd."

23:06.101 --> 23:07.637
I walk in,
and I hear splashing.

23:07.936 --> 23:09.801
well yeah,
I mean it got hot in L.A.

23:10.105 --> 23:11.720
when stan went to work,

23:12.024 --> 23:13.639
bob'd go in to his apartment
and smoke dope

23:13.942 --> 23:15.728
and listen to stan's records.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.768
but yeah, he came home
and I was soaking

23:18.071 --> 23:20.653
in his tub,
listening to records.

23:20.949 --> 23:23.190
that did it,
I was really pissed.

23:23.493 --> 23:27.577
so I said, "well bob, no,
but it's time for you
to get a job.

23:27.873 --> 23:30.580
"we need a receiving clerk.
why don't you be a
receiving clerk. "

23:30.876 --> 23:32.912
in november, actually,
they opened the store.

23:33.212 --> 23:34.577
so I had hung around
for quite a bit,

23:34.880 --> 23:36.290
he said,
"come in the store and apply,"

23:36.590 --> 23:38.922
and I did, and charlie shaw,
the manager at the time,

23:39.218 --> 23:41.129
hired me, immediately.

23:41.428 --> 23:42.884
and then once I got
in the door,

23:43.180 --> 23:45.136
I just fell in love
with being in the building.

23:45.432 --> 23:47.764
I had no clue
about the record industry,

23:48.060 --> 23:50.176
but it was, to me,
right up my alley.

23:50.479 --> 23:52.720
this is like being home
with a bunch of friends,

23:53.023 --> 23:55.059
and much more fun
than i'd ever had

23:55.359 --> 23:57.065
in any of my previous jobs.

23:57.361 --> 23:58.817
[russ]again, now here,

23:59.112 --> 24:00.522
we hadn't opened a store
since san francisco,

24:00.822 --> 24:02.938
and the same thing happened
in los angeles.

24:03.242 --> 24:06.780
we were in the midst
of a marvelous audience,

24:07.079 --> 24:09.035
I mean you had
this variety of people

24:09.331 --> 24:12.789
with all kinds of musical
tastes and money. [chuckles]

24:13.085 --> 24:15.827
[Bob Delanoy] I mean,
I knew sunset was like the focus

24:16.129 --> 24:17.835
of the whole
record industry, there.

24:18.131 --> 24:19.712
if you didn't get it
in that store,

24:20.008 --> 24:21.873
their whole rest
of their marketing crew

24:22.177 --> 24:24.133
thought you were doing
a shit job.

24:24.429 --> 24:25.794
[russ]
but imagine where we were.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.134
we were within
walking distance, virtually,

24:28.433 --> 24:31.391
of the entire record industry,
in the l.a. area.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.518
[Steve Nikkel] I think that was
a good strategy, I mean,

24:33.814 --> 24:36.226
if you're about music, you go
to where the music's being made.

24:36.525 --> 24:38.686
in los angeles,
especially in san francisco,

24:38.986 --> 24:41.944
so many of the artists
lived in our neighborhood.

24:42.239 --> 24:45.356
I mean, we were the local record
store for them, so it was great.

24:45.659 --> 24:48.366
[Stan] I remember David Geffen
coming in to the store
one saturday,

24:48.662 --> 24:50.698
and I was chatting with him,
and he says,

24:50.998 --> 24:52.829
"hey, you gotta come listen
to this record.ii

24:53.125 --> 24:55.241
I go, "okay."
so I hop into his car

24:55.544 --> 24:57.455
and we drive up into
the hollywood hills somewhere

24:57.754 --> 24:58.834
to where he was living,

24:59.131 --> 25:01.668
and he took out
an acetate test pressing,

25:01.967 --> 25:03.457
he put it on, and he played it,

25:03.760 --> 25:05.296
and it was the eagles'
first record.

25:05.595 --> 25:06.926
[david]you had the troubadour,
and you had the roxy,

25:07.222 --> 25:08.462
and you had the whiskey,

25:08.765 --> 25:11.222
and lots of clubs
that they played coming up,

25:11.518 --> 25:13.054
so those artists
would look through Tower

25:13.353 --> 25:14.889
wonder when their records
were going to be there,

25:15.188 --> 25:16.928
and would they have piles,
that kind of thing.

25:17.232 --> 25:19.598
if you loved music,
and having a record collection,

25:19.901 --> 25:22.392
which, I did,
it was exciting
to walk through the store.

25:22.696 --> 25:25.153
I went there
three or four times a week.

25:25.449 --> 25:27.815
we just drove down
sunset boulevard...

25:28.118 --> 25:31.861
[chuckles]
and we were just eyeballing
everything we could see,

25:32.164 --> 25:34.906
and there was
a huge record store.

25:35.208 --> 25:38.746
it was that place
where your dreams

25:39.046 --> 25:41.037
meet the listener.

25:41.340 --> 25:44.628
that's where
the final connection was made.

25:44.926 --> 25:46.382
that audience you dreamt of

25:46.678 --> 25:49.636
is walking
through the door right now.

25:49.931 --> 25:52.923
and you can stand there
and watch that happen.

25:53.226 --> 25:54.841
they are your listeners.

25:55.145 --> 25:56.931
and the place also served

25:57.230 --> 25:59.346
as kind of a lost boys club,

25:59.649 --> 26:02.356
so if you were
a young musician,

26:02.652 --> 26:05.940
you came into town
and you didn't know what to do,

26:06.239 --> 26:08.901
the first thing you did
is you went to Tower Records.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.317
artists who were in california
and in los angeles

26:11.620 --> 26:14.157
would go into
Tower Records to find out
where their records were.

26:14.456 --> 26:15.741
and if there was
a pile of elton john

26:16.041 --> 26:17.872
and there wasn't
a pile of the eagles,

26:18.168 --> 26:19.874
the eagles weren't happy,
or vice versa.

26:20.170 --> 26:22.126
I mean there were
a couple people that came in

26:22.422 --> 26:24.128
to the store
that I was so in awe of,

26:24.424 --> 26:27.382
I couldn't even, you know,
I couldn't even approach them.

26:27.677 --> 26:29.508
eric clapton, when he came in,

26:29.805 --> 26:33.172
jimmy page, pete townshend,
it was a constant flow.

26:33.475 --> 26:35.056
and nobody ever bothered them.

26:35.352 --> 26:37.809
I mean, they had a place there
where they could go

26:38.105 --> 26:39.845
and maybe a few people,
"oh, look over there.

26:40.148 --> 26:41.684
there's elton john,"
or whatever,

26:41.983 --> 26:43.189
but they kind of knew,

26:43.485 --> 26:44.975
that was a place
where you could hang

26:45.278 --> 26:47.109
and not really worry
about anybody hassling you.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.271
tuesday mornings
I would be at Tower Records

26:49.574 --> 26:52.316
at 10:00, 9:00 in la.

26:52.619 --> 26:54.234
the store'd open at nine
and they'd let me in.

26:54.538 --> 26:56.904
and it was a ritual,
and it was a ritual I loved.

26:57.207 --> 26:58.492
it was, you know,
my music center.

26:58.792 --> 27:01.033
yeah, I knew
where everything was.

27:01.336 --> 27:03.167
and if they didn't have
something in one week,

27:03.463 --> 27:04.703
or the next week,

27:05.006 --> 27:07.338
I told them, I said,
"you need to get this in."

27:07.634 --> 27:10.376
well elton was one
that used to come
even during business hours.

27:10.679 --> 27:12.169
he'd come in
with his limo driver.

27:12.472 --> 27:14.008
his limo driver would
just stand there with bags

27:14.307 --> 27:16.343
and he would come through
with a long, long list,

27:16.643 --> 27:18.554
and go through
the record bins, picking out

27:18.854 --> 27:20.560
all the new releases
that he had seen.

27:20.856 --> 27:22.471
[Elton John] I mean,
Tower just had everything.

27:22.774 --> 27:25.481
those people knew their stuff.
they were really on the ball.

27:25.777 --> 27:28.268
they weren't just employees
that happened to work
in a music store,

27:28.572 --> 27:29.778
they were devotees of music.

27:30.073 --> 27:31.688
that's what I loved
about the Tower.

27:31.992 --> 27:33.107
I could talk about music
to them, and they'd say,

27:33.410 --> 27:34.900
" have you heard this?"

27:35.203 --> 27:37.660
it was just...
they were like friends.

27:37.956 --> 27:39.742
I knew the guys
in the store pretty well

27:40.041 --> 27:41.656
because I was so,
you know, regular.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.249
- [interviewer] no, that's stan.
- that's stan.

27:46.548 --> 27:49.665
he was my main man.
yeah, he was great.

27:49.968 --> 27:52.880
and he would go through
every single aisle,

27:53.180 --> 27:56.764
every single bin,
and he had an incredible memory

27:57.058 --> 27:58.468
from what records he had,

27:58.768 --> 28:00.724
and he'd get like
two to three each.

28:01.021 --> 28:02.852
one for each one of his houses.

28:03.148 --> 28:05.309
[elton john]
it was comfortable
and not intimidating at all.

28:05.609 --> 28:09.022
it was inviting, it was like
going to your favorite cafe.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.733
[stan]
and eventually we said,
"elton, we'll open early

28:12.032 --> 28:13.363
for you if you want
to come in."

28:13.658 --> 28:15.944
so, we started opening
like at 8:00 am.

28:16.244 --> 28:18.360
I can honestly say this
without any exaggeration,

28:18.663 --> 28:19.994
I spent more money
in Tower Records

28:20.290 --> 28:21.700
than any other human being.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.039
[upbeat '603 music playing]

28:26.338 --> 28:27.953
[stan]
once the word's out

28:28.256 --> 28:30.497
that's where the stars are,
it really clicked.

28:30.800 --> 28:33.963
and then it became
the place to go in la.

28:34.262 --> 28:38.722
[engine roaring]

28:39.017 --> 28:40.257
[recording of john lennon]
did you know

28:40.560 --> 28:41.925
the world's
largest record store

28:42.229 --> 28:44.311
in the known world,
and universe, et cetera,

28:44.606 --> 28:45.812
is here in los angeles?

28:46.107 --> 28:47.938
it is and it's called
Tower Records.

28:48.235 --> 28:51.068
and Tower Records is located
in the heart of sunset strip.

28:51.363 --> 28:52.728
at Tower you'll find
tens of thousands

28:53.031 --> 28:54.771
of your favorite lps and tapes,

28:55.075 --> 28:56.940
and you'll find that they're
all super discount priced.

28:57.244 --> 28:59.326
Tower'll always save you money
on the lps and tapes you buy.

28:59.621 --> 29:01.907
you'll find more rock lps
than you ever thought existed

29:02.207 --> 29:05.040
and that includes
more imported rock lps
if you need that stuff.

29:05.335 --> 29:06.825
you'll find more jazz,
more classics,

29:07.128 --> 29:09.039
easy listening, more country,
more international,

29:09.339 --> 29:10.749
more spoken words,
and more words.

29:11.049 --> 29:12.164
more of everything
than you've ever seen

29:12.467 --> 29:14.003
in your whole life
in one store,

29:14.302 --> 29:15.758
at one time.

29:16.054 --> 29:18.010
and you'll find thousands
of 45 rpm singles.

29:18.306 --> 29:21.469
in short,
the largest record store
in the known world, hmm,

29:21.768 --> 29:23.304
lives up to its name.

29:23.603 --> 29:25.093
shop Tower Records in the heart
of sunset strip tonight,

29:25.397 --> 29:27.137
and every night of the year,
until midnight.

29:27.440 --> 29:28.930
and Tower will have
my latest album

29:29.234 --> 29:31.816
walls and bridges,
this afternoon, so go get it!

29:47.085 --> 29:48.495
[Steve Nikkel]
part of the concept with Tower

29:48.795 --> 29:51.036
was as much social
as it was retail,

29:51.339 --> 29:53.170
you know,
before social networking

29:53.466 --> 29:56.708
and social media,
people went outside.

29:57.012 --> 30:00.220
people would spend
hours together just
digging through the bins.

30:00.515 --> 30:02.426
you know, and people would meet
at Tower Records.

30:02.726 --> 30:06.059
I mean, we were a destination.
people would hook up at Tower.

30:06.354 --> 30:08.390
[bob delanoy]
and that kind of oaptured my,

30:08.690 --> 30:10.806
wow, this is
a really cool place to work.

30:11.109 --> 30:12.770
and then of course,
once I got in the back room,

30:13.069 --> 30:15.651
I really started to see
what went on in that store.

30:15.947 --> 30:19.531
[electric guitar riff]

30:21.119 --> 30:22.450
there was drinking going on.

30:22.746 --> 30:25.738
absoÂ—fuckingÂ—lutely,
just hammered. [chuckles]

30:26.041 --> 30:28.908
there was a culture
that you could drink
as much as you want,

30:29.210 --> 30:32.452
you can do whatever the hell
you wanted, but you know,
you had to come to work.

30:32.756 --> 30:34.292
there was a guy
who slept in the office

30:34.591 --> 30:37.333
[chuckles] and washed his pits
with comet cleanser

30:37.636 --> 30:39.092
he'd slept in the office
all night,

30:39.387 --> 30:41.093
and had to get up for work
the next day to open ur

30:41.389 --> 30:42.754
sometimes you could
even come to work

30:43.058 --> 30:46.095
say for an hour
and go home with cocktail flu.

30:46.394 --> 30:48.180
but there was thing
about showing up,

30:48.480 --> 30:49.845
manning up, coming to work,

30:50.148 --> 30:52.434
and even if you threw up,
you had to show ur

30:52.734 --> 30:55.976
the rules were don't smoke dope
on the premises.

30:56.279 --> 30:58.190
and certainly don't drink
on the premises.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.776
that didn't mean
that once in a while
there wasn't a party back there,

31:01.076 --> 31:04.193
but you know,
you do your job during the day,

31:04.496 --> 31:06.111
had a good time doing it,

31:06.414 --> 31:09.577
and you'd go out and play
the way you wanted to at night.

31:09.876 --> 31:11.491
hell, there were many nights
we just came to work

31:11.795 --> 31:14.502
and never went to bed
for christ's sakes. [laughs]

31:14.798 --> 31:17.631
that's not cocktail flu,
that's a lifestyle.

31:17.926 --> 31:19.917
when you hit
the late '6os, early '7os

31:20.220 --> 31:22.802
you start to get to kind of
the hookers and blow era

31:23.098 --> 31:24.963
of the record industry
and this continued

31:25.266 --> 31:27.302
all the way through
the end of the disco era.

31:27.602 --> 31:30.059
yeah, '708 is when
we started doing...

31:30.355 --> 31:32.437
hand truck fuel, yes.
[chuckles]

31:32.732 --> 31:34.723
[heidi]hand truck fuel
is a controlled substance

31:35.026 --> 31:37.108
that you ingest
th rough a small straw

31:37.404 --> 31:40.066
in your nose [chuckles].

31:40.365 --> 31:43.152
seems like Tower Records people
always ended up in a bathroom.

31:43.451 --> 31:46.864
either in a hot tub,
you know, probably drinking,

31:47.163 --> 31:49.119
maybe smoking
a little pot or whatever.

31:49.416 --> 31:53.159
we used to do
inventories overnight
or we would work late,

31:53.461 --> 31:56.248
doing whatever
project we were doing,
and we needed hand truck fuel,

31:56.548 --> 31:58.038
which, by the way,
we took paid-outs for.

31:58.341 --> 31:59.547
no one even caught it.
[laughs]

31:59.843 --> 32:01.458
there was
hand truck fuel, yeah.

32:01.761 --> 32:03.752
[mark]you understood
you had a lot of latitude

32:04.055 --> 32:06.296
to do what you wanted,
to manage the way you wanted,

32:06.599 --> 32:08.339
and there wasn't going
to be any real repercussions

32:08.643 --> 32:10.258
if things went terribly wrong,

32:10.562 --> 32:12.223
because the whole thing
was an experiment

32:12.522 --> 32:13.602
from day one until the end.

32:13.898 --> 32:16.230
but... the store
always got opened.

32:16.526 --> 32:19.233
we always covered the shifts.
no matter what.

32:19.529 --> 32:21.986
[mark[it was always
a party atmosphere,
it was never work.

32:25.702 --> 32:30.241
[rudy danzinger] russ was
the free-swinging guy, man.
he enjoyed life.

32:30.540 --> 32:34.158
[man]he liked to buy
drinks for people after work,
especially the girls.

32:34.461 --> 32:38.249
there was nothing more common
than russ rounding up
all the babes

32:38.548 --> 32:40.755
and taking them to the bar,
and you're stuck
behind the counter,

32:41.050 --> 32:42.756
the only guy in the store,
you know.

32:43.052 --> 32:45.543
[mike]my father
was always a ladies' man.

32:45.847 --> 32:49.339
he was attracted
to many a beautiful woman,

32:49.642 --> 32:51.257
and they were to him.

32:51.561 --> 32:52.892
but he always
respected the women,

32:53.188 --> 32:55.349
I mean, when they were working,
it was one thing,

32:55.648 --> 32:58.060
when it was partying,
it was altogether different.

32:58.359 --> 32:59.769
I can remember one night,

33:00.069 --> 33:02.185
it was about five in the morning
and we had been partying,

33:02.489 --> 33:05.856
and for some reason the alarm
went off at Tower Broadway,

33:06.159 --> 33:09.492
and bud martin at the time,
he was the vice president
of the company.

33:09.788 --> 33:11.244
he shows up,
and we were actually

33:11.539 --> 33:13.029
in the back room
still drinking.

33:13.333 --> 33:15.039
well, he got a little
pissed off that night.

33:15.335 --> 33:18.202
bud martin didn't have
the same loose feel

33:18.505 --> 33:19.836
for management that russ did.

33:20.131 --> 33:22.247
bud was the one that
was that glue, so to speak,

33:22.550 --> 33:25.542
that was able to hold
this thing called Tower,

33:25.845 --> 33:27.551
and this culture
that started rolling,

33:27.847 --> 33:29.963
and russ would have
never ever been able

33:30.266 --> 33:33.429
to keep it together
without bud, no question.

33:33.728 --> 33:36.185
[russ]bud martin,
he was my dad's accountant,

33:36.481 --> 33:40.065
and when Tower opened,
he had a little private office,

33:40.360 --> 33:41.691
so that became our office.

33:41.986 --> 33:44.227
bud controlled most
of all the divisions--

33:44.531 --> 33:46.237
the accounts payable,
sales audit,

33:46.533 --> 33:48.319
all those areas.
I mean, he was--

33:48.618 --> 33:50.028
when they had a problem,
they'd go to bud.

33:50.328 --> 33:51.613
I was not a financial manager,

33:51.913 --> 33:53.653
I certainly wasn't a CPA.

33:53.957 --> 33:56.323
I had no business
school training,

33:56.626 --> 33:58.491
so I had to trust him,
and I did.

33:58.795 --> 34:00.410
bud was at one end
of the hall, mr. no,

34:00.713 --> 34:02.704
and russ was at the other
end of the hall, mr. yes,

34:03.007 --> 34:04.292
and so you could go
to russ and get a yes,

34:04.592 --> 34:06.878
then you had to go
down the hall to mr. no,

34:07.178 --> 34:08.418
and tell him,
mr. yes had said yes,

34:08.721 --> 34:10.210
and then you had
to justify to bud

34:10.514 --> 34:12.630
why russ had said yes.
[laughs]

34:12.934 --> 34:14.299
yeah, it was a constant battle.

34:14.601 --> 34:17.264
[mike]bud became
almost like partner with russ.

34:17.563 --> 34:18.643
they were yin and yang.

34:18.940 --> 34:20.601
he was the antith esis
of russ solomon.

34:20.900 --> 34:23.733
russ was like a very carefree,
if you will,

34:24.027 --> 34:26.360
entrepreneur who loved music

34:26.656 --> 34:28.521
and bud was actually
a businessman.

34:28.824 --> 34:30.406
I would make it work

34:30.702 --> 34:32.362
by hiring my people
to go out and do it.

34:32.661 --> 34:34.822
he would make it work
because he had to pay for it.

34:35.123 --> 34:37.659
I suppose there was
a rather serious

34:37.958 --> 34:41.201
loveÂ—hate relationship
going on between russ and bud,

34:41.504 --> 34:44.210
because again, russ would say,
"spend the money, get it done,"

34:44.507 --> 34:46.371
and then bud would say,
"no, you can't spend the money."

34:46.676 --> 34:49.338
we would go to lunch every day

34:49.637 --> 34:52.424
and I would get...
at lunch, we would argue.

34:52.724 --> 34:53.554
he was the keeper
of the money,

34:53.850 --> 34:55.090
and he didn't let anything go.

34:55.393 --> 34:56.428
and he and russ
would have battles

34:56.728 --> 34:58.309
about russ wanting
to open up a store

34:58.605 --> 34:59.845
and bud said,
"I don't have any money,

35:00.148 --> 35:01.684
and we're going to go
to the poor house."

35:01.983 --> 35:03.268
russ'd say,
"bud, i'm doing it.

35:03.568 --> 35:04.603
figure out how to get it done."

35:04.903 --> 35:06.359
but if you get
two drinks in him,

35:06.654 --> 35:08.895
he would be literally hanging
from the lampshades.

35:09.198 --> 35:11.780
you know what I mean?
or swinging on the chandelier.

35:12.076 --> 35:16.365
he had a conservative
monetary policy

35:16.664 --> 35:18.950
but a liberal social policy.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.957
[upbeat trumpet music playing]

35:24.505 --> 35:27.463
[russ]it was dangerous
to go out with him
and get him drunk.

35:27.759 --> 35:30.421
we've been thrown out
of a few restaurants, you know.

35:30.720 --> 35:33.757
it was just that
he was living another life,

35:34.057 --> 35:36.514
dating and things like that,
buying splurges.

35:36.809 --> 35:39.972
just do, probably just do
normal things you do with money.

35:40.271 --> 35:41.386
you spend it.

35:41.689 --> 35:44.021
bud loved cars.

35:44.317 --> 35:47.309
he would buy at least
one new car every year.

35:47.612 --> 35:49.318
sometimes more than one car,

35:49.614 --> 35:51.070
continuously trading them in.

35:51.366 --> 35:54.199
he was also the most random
woman chaser on the planet.

35:54.494 --> 35:56.359
he literally had an extra office
out of his office

35:56.663 --> 35:58.528
where he took women
to wink them.

35:58.831 --> 36:00.446
he'd hire them as secretaries.

36:00.750 --> 36:03.492
and I mean,
it was so flamboyantly bad

36:03.795 --> 36:05.331
that it had to be a joke.

36:05.630 --> 36:06.790
<i>having a fling again</i>

36:07.090 --> 36:08.455
<i>younger than spring again</i>

36:08.758 --> 36:11.090
<i>feeling that zing again wow</i>

36:11.386 --> 36:15.220
he was straight laced
with a secret life.

36:15.515 --> 36:16.595
I think he was intrigued
by the idea

36:16.891 --> 36:18.176
that we could
race along too,

36:18.476 --> 36:20.592
because he'd never
have done it himself.

36:20.895 --> 36:22.601
so I had to kind
of lead the charge.

36:22.897 --> 36:24.307
we use to call it
the russ bus, yeah.

36:24.607 --> 36:25.517
you know he was so fearless

36:25.817 --> 36:27.557
and he was so enthusiastic

36:27.860 --> 36:29.316
about what he--
I don't think he had a clue

36:29.612 --> 36:31.193
what he was doing, seriously.

36:31.489 --> 36:33.320
[rudy danzinger]russ just had
a special way of living.

36:33.616 --> 36:35.777
[mark]he didn't play golf,
he didn't go hunting,

36:36.077 --> 36:38.284
Tower Records was what he did.
that's what he...

36:38.579 --> 36:39.739
he breathed that.

36:40.039 --> 36:41.700
you were part of his family.
you were part of

36:42.000 --> 36:44.491
the Tower experience,
as it were.

36:46.129 --> 36:47.710
[russ]
the record companies and narm

36:48.006 --> 36:50.622
would have conventions
in los angeles, mainly.

36:50.925 --> 36:54.008
so, for fun,
I would start stealing ties.

36:54.303 --> 36:56.589
I said you're going to feel
much better without this.

36:56.889 --> 36:59.130
you'll be much more comfortable.
what are you doing?

36:59.434 --> 37:02.016
coming to california,
big shots from new york

37:02.311 --> 37:03.426
for crying out loud.

37:03.730 --> 37:05.186
you come out here,
you put on your suit,

37:05.481 --> 37:06.561
you put on your tie,

37:06.858 --> 37:08.064
you know,
and you act like big shots.

37:08.359 --> 37:09.599
I said,
"we're here in California.

37:09.902 --> 37:11.108
"we have a lot--
everything's loose.

37:11.404 --> 37:13.144
take your tie off."

37:13.448 --> 37:15.313
[steve]
so they walk in and frannie,
who was his secretary,

37:15.616 --> 37:17.948
would grab the scissors
and chop a tie.

37:18.244 --> 37:20.530
and after a while,
it became the stuff of legends.

37:20.830 --> 37:22.195
so it was like,
people would walk in

37:22.498 --> 37:23.954
and just give him the tie.

37:24.250 --> 37:28.038
the tie thing just got part
of his reputation, you know.

37:28.337 --> 37:32.046
don't wear a good tie in there,
or leave it in the car.

37:32.341 --> 37:33.706
[jim urie]he never collected
any of my ties,

37:34.010 --> 37:35.716
because I had heard
those stories

37:36.012 --> 37:37.548
and of course,
when I became a national guy,

37:37.847 --> 37:39.462
I was going out there.

37:39.766 --> 37:40.676
they had a big plaque
on the wall,

37:40.975 --> 37:42.465
must have been this big,

37:42.769 --> 37:45.226
and it was an array of neckties

37:45.521 --> 37:47.557
that had been cut off,
right about here.

37:47.857 --> 37:50.599
I would steal the whole tie.
I got a bad rap, you know,

37:50.902 --> 37:52.893
for cutting the ties off.
never cut a tie.

37:53.196 --> 37:55.278
always stole the whole tie.

37:55.573 --> 37:57.529
made the guy
give me a card, usually,

37:57.825 --> 37:59.031
if they were friendly.

37:59.327 --> 38:00.442
sometimes they weren't
very friendly

38:00.745 --> 38:01.905
when you steal
their tie, really.

38:02.205 --> 38:03.615
but they all felt

38:03.915 --> 38:05.655
a lot more comfortable
not wearing 'em.

38:07.502 --> 38:09.709
[man] I think his
leadership and his vision

38:10.004 --> 38:11.414
and the way he dealt
with his people

38:11.714 --> 38:13.250
really was significant.

38:13.549 --> 38:14.789
[russ]if it hadn't been
for these people

38:15.093 --> 38:16.253
being able
to do these things for me,

38:16.552 --> 38:18.133
we could never
have done anything.

38:18.429 --> 38:20.511
we didn't do anything
in a formal way.

38:20.807 --> 38:22.468
we did it on the fly.

38:22.767 --> 38:23.677
it was the russ bus.

38:23.976 --> 38:24.840
with Tower Records,

38:25.144 --> 38:26.680
you had an idea, a thought,

38:26.979 --> 38:28.560
you either went
to russ or bud with it,

38:28.856 --> 38:30.471
and flew with it,
it was that simple.

38:30.775 --> 38:32.015
that was the fun part.

38:32.318 --> 38:33.478
you never fucking knew

38:33.778 --> 38:35.018
where it was going to take you.

38:36.823 --> 38:39.565
russ solomon,
because he was Tower Records,

38:39.867 --> 38:42.324
there wasn't all these layers
of management.

38:42.620 --> 38:45.612
you sat down with russ
and that's how the company ran.

38:45.915 --> 38:47.246
it ran that way for a long time.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.908
you'd grow your people
out of the stores,

38:50.211 --> 38:51.667
send them to a new store,

38:51.963 --> 38:54.045
they'd grow a whole crop
of new people

38:54.340 --> 38:57.673
that would go to the next store,
and so on.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.630
[ken] back then there
were few enough people

38:59.929 --> 39:02.386
that we all even went
to all the store openings.

39:02.682 --> 39:05.139
so we'd go to a town
for two or three weeks

39:05.434 --> 39:08.346
and literally a team of us
put the stores together.

39:08.646 --> 39:10.728
obviously, as Tower got
very big, we had a team

39:11.023 --> 39:13.514
whose job that was to do it
separate from the retail,

39:13.818 --> 39:15.479
but this was the retail team,
you know,

39:15.778 --> 39:18.144
we'd take our classical buyer,
and our assistant manager,

39:18.447 --> 39:21.063
and our favorite rock buyer,
and a couple managers,

39:21.367 --> 39:24.109
and go camp out for
a couple of weeks in a store.

39:24.412 --> 39:25.948
bringing the racks in,
marking the records,

39:26.247 --> 39:27.578
putting the records
in the shelves,

39:27.874 --> 39:29.535
setting everything up
so it really helped

39:29.834 --> 39:31.540
make you feel like
you were part of a team,

39:31.836 --> 39:34.327
but it also made you feel like
you were personally successful

39:34.630 --> 39:37.292
because you were able
to be part of this.

39:37.592 --> 39:38.672
[russ]so by 1979,

39:38.968 --> 39:41.459
we were really
a west coast operation.

39:41.762 --> 39:43.673
we'd opened stores
all the way from seattle

39:43.973 --> 39:45.338
to san diego,

39:45.641 --> 39:47.757
and then we went over
to phoenix and tempe.

39:48.060 --> 39:50.642
so a couple of guys came over
and visited me,

39:50.938 --> 39:53.270
hugh sazaki and akehana zowa.

39:53.566 --> 39:57.058
they said they wanted to start
up Tower Records in japan.

39:57.361 --> 39:59.147
these two gentlemen,
aki and hugh,

39:59.447 --> 40:01.062
had come to sacramento,
met with russ,

40:01.365 --> 40:03.071
and russ would fall
for any idea,

40:03.367 --> 40:04.948
and then they went back
to japan,

40:05.244 --> 40:07.951
and then a few weeks later
called up and said,

40:08.247 --> 40:09.783
"come on over.
we want to show you around."

40:10.082 --> 40:11.572
so they sent us
a couple of tickets.

40:11.876 --> 40:14.709
we traveled all over japan,
saw the sights,

40:15.004 --> 40:17.461
saw the existing
record retailers over there.

40:17.757 --> 40:19.418
[mark]
but one guy up in sapporo,

40:19.717 --> 40:22.174
which was a little island on
the northern border of japan,

40:22.470 --> 40:24.335
i think had stolen the name
Tower Records,

40:24.639 --> 40:26.630
and literally
had a Tower Record store.

40:26.933 --> 40:28.423
we said, "oh, no."

40:28.726 --> 40:30.717
so we went up
and we saw this, and said,

40:31.020 --> 40:32.385
"that's not very nice,
you've stolen our name.

40:32.688 --> 40:34.269
you shouldn't have done that. "

40:34.565 --> 40:36.897
but at least, if we open
our wholesale operation here,

40:37.193 --> 40:39.980
will you let us sell you
the imported records,

40:40.279 --> 40:41.735
and you guys run it?

40:42.031 --> 40:43.316
so that's how it started.

40:45.618 --> 40:48.701
russ was always enthusiastic
about something new.

40:48.996 --> 40:51.032
everybody else
on the record side hated it.

40:51.332 --> 40:52.913
they said, "we're an american
record company,

40:53.209 --> 40:54.699
we sell retail in america."

40:55.002 --> 40:56.492
they didn't know anything
about japan.

40:56.796 --> 40:58.878
russ didn't have any kind
of attitude like that.

40:59.173 --> 41:01.289
and they had no desire
to do it.

41:01.592 --> 41:03.674
they didn't care, it was just
one of russ' little projects.

41:03.970 --> 41:05.710
i was just a nobody receiving
clerk, and I said,

41:06.013 --> 41:07.844
"hell, i'll help you out.
whatever you want to do."

41:08.140 --> 41:09.880
our job at Tower Broadway

41:10.184 --> 41:12.470
was we would pull the records
out of stock from broadway,

41:12.770 --> 41:14.510
and ship them to japan,

41:14.814 --> 41:16.224
and that's when
i first got involved with russ,

41:16.524 --> 41:17.809
as I was the shipping
and receiving clerk

41:18.109 --> 41:20.225
making probably
five bucks an hour.

41:20.528 --> 41:22.143
that's how russ
and I became friends.

41:22.446 --> 41:24.903
nobody else would help him.

41:25.199 --> 41:26.780
[russ]
this goes on for a few months,

41:27.076 --> 41:29.658
and things are not really
looking all that good.

41:29.954 --> 41:31.569
we don't know
what is going wrong,

41:31.872 --> 41:34.579
but sad but true, they didn't
know what they were doing,

41:34.875 --> 41:36.160
and they weren't
very good at it.

41:36.460 --> 41:38.121
[mark] I think it was
a friday evening,

41:38.421 --> 41:40.036
and probably russ and i,
i know I was in russ' office,

41:40.339 --> 41:41.624
and we had been drinking,

41:41.924 --> 41:43.130
had a few cocktails,
you know, as you would

41:43.426 --> 41:44.882
wind down after a tough day.

41:45.177 --> 41:46.667
somehow the subject came up,

41:46.971 --> 41:48.836
"who am I going to send
to japan?"

41:49.140 --> 41:51.347
and he asked me that question,
"who am I going
to send to japan?"

41:51.642 --> 41:53.428
and I said,
"the only guy to send is me."

41:53.728 --> 41:55.969
and he goes,
"what do you mean, you?
you're not a store manager,

41:56.272 --> 41:57.603
you don't know
anything about it. "

41:57.898 --> 41:59.308
and I said,
"well, i'm the one

41:59.608 --> 42:00.768
who's been doing
all this work for japan."

42:01.068 --> 42:02.399
he goes, "do you think
you can do it?"

42:02.695 --> 42:04.811
i said, "sure."
he goes, "then go."

42:05.114 --> 42:06.229
you didn't have to go through
a bunch of people

42:06.532 --> 42:07.817
to make a decision
at Tower Records.

42:08.117 --> 42:09.072
he was the worst person to send

42:09.368 --> 42:10.528
i would ever think
in my life.

42:10.828 --> 42:11.908
i mean he had
the social skills

42:12.204 --> 42:13.239
of a warthog in heat,
you kidding me?

42:13.539 --> 42:15.154
but I think the reason
that they did,

42:15.458 --> 42:17.244
is he knew a lot
about shipping and receiving,

42:17.543 --> 42:19.829
he'd learned about
international shipping.

42:20.129 --> 42:22.040
they needed somebody to know
about how to get the product
in and out of there.

42:22.340 --> 42:24.080
i'd only been there
two and a half years.

42:24.383 --> 42:26.749
i saw it as an opportunity
to do something.

42:28.596 --> 42:30.382
[russ]we had no idea
what we're doing.

42:30.681 --> 42:33.673
i'll be honest with you,
we had not a clue.

42:33.976 --> 42:35.182
but we did it anyhow.

42:35.478 --> 42:36.968
i had literally
no idea what to expect.

42:37.271 --> 42:39.262
i'd never been to japan,
i had to go get a passport.

42:39.565 --> 42:41.772
we had a warehouse in akasaka,

42:42.068 --> 42:44.650
which is like the beverly hills
of tokyo, for god's sakes.

42:44.945 --> 42:46.276
we had this little warehouse,

42:46.572 --> 42:47.857
and I was supposed
to be there for six months.

42:48.157 --> 42:49.272
that was my deal,
you got six months

42:49.575 --> 42:51.782
to go either fix it or close it.

42:54.038 --> 42:55.778
[mark]shibuya was a little
like times square,

42:56.082 --> 42:57.822
laginsu was a little
like times square.

42:58.125 --> 42:59.865
tokyo was like times square.

43:00.169 --> 43:01.284
i mean the place
was always lit ur

43:01.587 --> 43:03.919
at nighttime, tokyo came alive.

43:06.008 --> 43:09.216
shibuya was a very hip,
more of a younger area

43:09.512 --> 43:11.594
for stores and kids
and people to hang out.

43:11.889 --> 43:13.971
the japan ese at that time
were very much

43:14.266 --> 43:16.052
into the culture
of american music.

43:16.352 --> 43:18.138
so I called russ, and said,
"russ, we're not closing

43:18.437 --> 43:19.973
the wholesale operation,

43:20.272 --> 43:21.387
we're going to
open up a retail store."

43:21.690 --> 43:23.681
and that set off
quite a firestorm

43:23.984 --> 43:26.441
of controversy to say the least.

43:26.737 --> 43:29.194
[mark]the push back
from stateside was,

43:29.490 --> 43:30.946
"you guys are crazy,
you're not going to do it."

43:31.242 --> 43:33.107
that was probably
bud's first impression.

43:33.411 --> 43:34.776
[mike]
bud wanted to be profitable.

43:35.079 --> 43:37.661
he didn't care so much
about being big.

43:37.957 --> 43:42.166
if you don't take advantage
of a new idea,

43:42.461 --> 43:45.294
if it makes any sense at all,

43:45.589 --> 43:46.999
then you've lost something.

43:48.926 --> 43:50.712
[mark]
russ wasn't omnipotent

43:51.011 --> 43:52.876
and he couldn't tell you,
"here, you go play with this,

43:53.180 --> 43:55.592
it's going to work,
go play with this, it isn't."

43:55.891 --> 43:57.222
this was russ' company.

43:57.518 --> 43:59.133
russ loved japan,
he loved the culture.

43:59.437 --> 44:01.519
and he said, "you know mark,
i think that's a great idea. "

44:01.814 --> 44:05.022
because he was so cutting edge.
you know, he was so hip.

44:05.317 --> 44:06.807
he was always taking
that next step forward

44:07.111 --> 44:08.396
before the forward was there.

44:08.696 --> 44:10.527
[mark] I saw this location
and loved it.

44:10.823 --> 44:12.905
called russ,
and I think he was in japan

44:13.200 --> 44:14.656
within two weeks
to look at the location.

44:17.371 --> 44:20.408
it took six to eight months
of legal wrangling to do this,

44:20.708 --> 44:22.744
because it hadn't
been done before.

44:23.043 --> 44:26.160
in japan, in order
to open up a business
you had to have a partner.

44:26.464 --> 44:29.581
there was restaurants,
shakey's pizza parlors

44:29.884 --> 44:32.842
and mcdonald's,
but those were all franchises.

44:33.137 --> 44:35.924
there was no retail
establishment in japan

44:36.223 --> 44:37.963
wholly owned
by an american company.

44:38.267 --> 44:40.508
it was something nobody else
had ever done, for christ sake.

44:40.811 --> 44:44.474
this was a 3,000 year old
country and nobody
could ever think

44:44.773 --> 44:46.104
of another american company

44:46.400 --> 44:49.062
opening a retail store
without a japanese partner.

44:49.361 --> 44:53.946
[rock music playing]

44:59.872 --> 45:02.079
[mark]getting all of
the racking, the records,

45:02.374 --> 45:04.080
the employees,
everything in place,

45:04.376 --> 45:06.867
that went without a hitch.
that was no problem.

45:07.171 --> 45:08.331
the hardest part, once again,

45:08.631 --> 45:10.667
was all of
the legal maneuvering

45:10.966 --> 45:13.002
that had to go on
just to open the store.

45:13.302 --> 45:16.635
but he did open up
the shibuya store.

45:16.931 --> 45:18.671
[mark]literally,
the morning we opened,

45:18.974 --> 45:20.555
we had over 300 or 400 people

45:20.851 --> 45:22.182
standing in line
to get in to the store.

45:24.230 --> 45:27.188
[russ]people were literally
squash ed against the door,

45:27.483 --> 45:29.940
waiting to get in,
and they poured in.

45:30.236 --> 45:31.066
you never saw anything like it.

45:31.362 --> 45:33.569
i mean, it was amazing.

45:33.864 --> 45:35.274
[mark] I remember,
the store was packed

45:35.574 --> 45:37.110
from the moment
we opened till we closed,

45:37.409 --> 45:40.276
we did like 65,
70 grand that day.

45:40.579 --> 45:42.535
it was like that
for the first month

45:42.831 --> 45:44.947
the store was open.
that store was just

45:45.251 --> 45:47.412
a huge success from day one.

45:47.711 --> 45:51.454
the japanese culture was
really into american music,

45:51.757 --> 45:54.043
and the fact that it was
an american import

45:54.343 --> 45:56.629
and not a japanese pressed...

45:56.929 --> 45:58.294
it wasn't the eagles
pressed in japan,

45:58.597 --> 46:00.133
it was the eagles
made in the united states

46:00.432 --> 46:01.672
brought to japan and sold,

46:01.976 --> 46:06.140
and that whole vibe
really sold well.

46:06.438 --> 46:07.678
we just happened
to literally be

46:07.982 --> 46:09.222
at the right place,
at the right time.

46:09.525 --> 46:11.937
you want to call that luck?
then call it luck.

46:12.236 --> 46:13.521
[interviewer]
what would you call it?

46:13.821 --> 46:14.901
luck. ha!

46:15.197 --> 46:16.812
[rock music playing]

46:19.493 --> 46:23.202
we weren't shoving americana
down japanese th roats,
for god's sakes,

46:23.497 --> 46:25.954
it was a culture,
it was a music culture.

46:26.250 --> 46:29.993
[russ]so he went and found
a second location in yokohama.

46:30.296 --> 46:32.082
he got it, we put it together,

46:32.381 --> 46:35.043
opened that damn thing,
and it was a success, heh.

46:35.342 --> 46:37.048
all we had to do
was open the doors.

46:37.344 --> 46:39.630
people flocked in the joint.

46:39.930 --> 46:42.216
expansion was obviously,
once ya do it,

46:42.516 --> 46:45.053
russ can't wait to do it again.

46:45.352 --> 46:46.888
[russ]
so then we started finding

46:47.187 --> 46:49.018
these kind of stores
all over the country,

46:49.315 --> 46:51.772
one right after another.

46:52.067 --> 46:54.228
[mark]and I think russ,
seeing the success it was

46:54.528 --> 46:56.814
globally, or nationally,
or internationally,

46:57.114 --> 46:59.196
i actually think
that gave him the impetus

46:59.491 --> 47:01.152
to move to new york.

47:01.452 --> 47:03.818
[jim urie]
first met russ solomon
in the early '803.

47:04.121 --> 47:06.282
at that point, I was
the new york branch manager

47:06.582 --> 47:08.368
for what is now sony music,

47:08.667 --> 47:10.703
it was called cbs records
at the time, and of course,

47:11.003 --> 47:13.244
everyone knew
about Tower Records,

47:13.547 --> 47:17.506
but it was not an east coast
phenomenon, at that point.

47:17.801 --> 47:20.258
[russ]we started with
a conversation I was having

47:20.554 --> 47:22.761
at the narm convention
in florida.

47:23.057 --> 47:25.218
we were talking about,
"gosh, you know,

47:25.517 --> 47:27.473
"i'd love to open
a classical store in new york

47:27.770 --> 47:31.103
because that's the place where
people like classical music."

47:31.398 --> 47:33.013
russ called up and said,

47:33.317 --> 47:35.228
"hey guys, I want you
to come to my office."

47:35.527 --> 47:37.233
we go in there, and russ says,

47:37.529 --> 47:39.394
"how would you like
to open the store

47:39.698 --> 47:43.486
"in the middle of the hippest
city in the united states

47:43.786 --> 47:45.117
by a college?"

47:45.412 --> 47:46.993
we had no idea
what he was talking about.

47:47.289 --> 47:50.577
and we go down into the bowels
of lower manhattan

47:50.876 --> 47:52.537
to the village,
4th and broadway.

47:52.836 --> 47:54.952
[steve nikkel]there wasn't even
a particular neighborhood.

47:55.255 --> 47:57.496
we started calling it
the village, and it became
part of the village.

47:57.800 --> 48:00.166
but it really wasn't part
of the village. [chuckles]

48:00.469 --> 48:03.506
but you spend enough money
in marketing and things happen.

48:03.806 --> 48:05.262
it was terrible,
it was like I kind of thought,

48:05.557 --> 48:08.094
"what the fuck is he thinking?"

48:08.394 --> 48:10.259
there was a dead dog
in the gutter.

48:10.562 --> 48:14.146
i'm in shock,
i thought we were...

48:14.441 --> 48:15.647
in the bowels of hell.

48:15.943 --> 48:17.604
[russ]
and it was really cheap rent.

48:17.903 --> 48:19.814
i mean the whole deal
was like 10 bucks a foot.

48:20.114 --> 48:21.570
[jim]literally, there was
nothing else there.

48:21.865 --> 48:24.402
empty office buildings,
empty storefronts,

48:24.702 --> 48:27.444
there was nothing around it.
i can't emphasize that enough.

48:27.746 --> 48:29.782
there was nothing
around it at all.

48:30.082 --> 48:33.074
you know, it was like
a massive four stories,

48:33.377 --> 48:34.662
m ezzanines,
escalators, you know,

48:34.962 --> 48:38.250
very, very expensive
store to build. very risky.

48:38.549 --> 48:40.460
[russ]we took it,
and then we fixed it up

48:40.759 --> 48:42.545
everybody thought
we were totally crazy.

48:42.845 --> 48:46.053
that nobody would ever go
to broadway and buy records,

48:46.348 --> 48:49.556
and we open up, and the people
are lined up to get in.

48:49.852 --> 48:52.093
[jim]and here is this
cavernous store,

48:52.396 --> 48:55.058
half a block footprint,
four stories,

48:55.357 --> 48:56.972
had an elevator it was so tall.

48:57.276 --> 48:59.517
god knows how much inventory
was in there.

48:59.820 --> 49:01.310
it looked fantastic,
of course,

49:01.613 --> 49:03.069
the vinyl with
the 12-inch artwork.

49:03.365 --> 49:05.105
i mean, it looked great,
and it was everywhere.

49:05.409 --> 49:07.274
their singles department alone

49:07.578 --> 49:09.569
was probably bigger
than any other store

49:09.872 --> 49:12.113
in my whole new york
tri-state area.

49:12.416 --> 49:14.498
and it wasn't three years later

49:14.793 --> 49:18.661
when that whole part of town
became vibrant again.

49:18.964 --> 49:22.172
Tower Records opening there
literally revived

49:22.468 --> 49:27.508
those eight or ten
square blocks of manhattan.

49:27.806 --> 49:30.047
everybody that worked there
was a character,

49:30.350 --> 49:31.180
but russ was the face

49:31.477 --> 49:33.513
of the company in every way.

49:33.812 --> 49:35.803
i worked at polygram records
in new york.

49:36.106 --> 49:38.313
as happens in any
entertainment company

49:38.609 --> 49:41.225
there was a change at the top
and so a whole bunch of us
got blown out as a result.

49:41.528 --> 49:44.440
new management coming in.
i was senior vice president
of marketing.

49:44.740 --> 49:47.607
and it feels pretty bad
to get fired.

49:47.910 --> 49:49.400
and you're on the outside
of this business

49:49.703 --> 49:51.284
you've been in your whole life,

49:51.580 --> 49:53.912
and your phone's not ringing,

49:54.208 --> 49:56.494
you worry about your family,
and all these things.

49:56.794 --> 49:58.659
russ used to have
this big christmas party

49:58.962 --> 50:00.327
in his major markets,

50:00.631 --> 50:02.371
and the one in new york
was really big.

50:02.674 --> 50:04.039
probably 500 people.

50:04.343 --> 50:05.833
and out of the blue
i get an invitation

50:06.136 --> 50:07.717
to go to the christmas party
at my home,

50:08.013 --> 50:09.503
and I was, of course
happy about that,

50:09.807 --> 50:11.092
i thought,
" do I really want to go

50:11.391 --> 50:12.301
have people looking at me,
feeling sorry?"

50:12.601 --> 50:13.340
but I finally decided to go.

50:13.644 --> 50:15.305
and I go in that night,

50:15.604 --> 50:18.516
and you sort of walked in
and walked down some stai rs.

50:18.816 --> 50:20.306
when you first walk in
you could see the whole place,

50:20.609 --> 50:22.895
and it was huge,
and shoulder to shoulder.

50:23.195 --> 50:25.481
and russ was like
the pied piper in the middle.

50:25.781 --> 50:28.363
where russ went,
there were throngs of people.

50:28.659 --> 50:30.115
as russ made his way
around the room,

50:30.410 --> 50:31.650
there was always
a throng of people.

50:31.954 --> 50:34.036
everybody wanted to shake
his hand, touch him.

50:34.331 --> 50:35.286
so, umm...

50:38.293 --> 50:39.123
i, uh...

50:40.504 --> 50:41.960
i finally shook his hand,

50:42.256 --> 50:44.542
said, "hi, thanks for
inviting me", whatever.

50:44.842 --> 50:47.458
he leaned over to me
and he said,

50:47.761 --> 50:51.049
"a couple of us are going out
for dinner afterward.
do you wanna go?"

50:52.474 --> 50:54.180
[choked up]
and, uh...

50:54.476 --> 50:56.137
let me start that again.

50:58.355 --> 51:00.346
"a couple of us are going out
to dinner. do you wanna go?"

51:00.649 --> 51:03.766
and I said,
"well, golly yeah, russ,
if you really want to have me."

51:04.069 --> 51:05.900
so he told me where and I went.

51:06.196 --> 51:08.187
and it was russ,
and four other people, and me.

51:13.453 --> 51:14.533
and, uh...

51:16.331 --> 51:17.411
and at that moment in my life,

51:17.708 --> 51:20.745
that meant... a lot.

51:22.546 --> 51:24.377
because I was down.

51:24.673 --> 51:26.755
and that russ solomon
would care enough,

51:27.050 --> 51:29.132
and do that
personal little touch...

51:32.055 --> 51:34.296
means something to me now,
20 some years later.

51:38.353 --> 51:41.060
he could have used it, I mean,
most guys would have used it

51:41.356 --> 51:42.937
as a business opportunity
and grabbed

51:43.233 --> 51:45.019
a couple record company
presidents and whatever,

51:45.319 --> 51:47.480
instead of
some out of work guy.

51:47.779 --> 51:50.316
but that's not the way
russ sees life.

51:58.332 --> 52:00.493
[Heidi] The whole magic
of Tower as a chain

52:00.792 --> 52:02.453
was that it was a chain
of independent stores.

52:02.753 --> 52:04.368
book stores as well
as the record stores.

52:04.671 --> 52:06.411
so when you walked
into a Tower Record store,

52:06.715 --> 52:08.626
you thought it was
the only one on the planet.

52:08.926 --> 52:11.542
the l.a. people always
thought the l.a. store
was the first store.

52:11.845 --> 52:14.086
the new yorkers always thought
the new york store was.

52:14.389 --> 52:16.926
the san francisco people thought
that their store was.

52:17.225 --> 52:18.840
because they all had
the individual flavor

52:19.144 --> 52:21.305
of the people who ran it
and who worked there.

52:21.605 --> 52:22.890
which made them very unique.

52:23.190 --> 52:26.307
there was no cookie cutter
going on at all.

52:26.610 --> 52:28.601
[steve nikkel]until we got
into some of the larger markets

52:28.904 --> 52:30.565
on the east coast,
then we started buying

52:30.864 --> 52:33.901
national tv for ads,
so we became a national brand.

52:34.201 --> 52:35.190
but you had to have

52:35.494 --> 52:36.984
the credibility
in the larger markets

52:37.287 --> 52:39.403
before you could go
into the suburbs.

52:39.706 --> 52:41.822
probably in about late '703,

52:42.125 --> 52:44.912
we established our own
advertising department.

52:45.212 --> 52:47.453
that was chris hopson
who ran it.

52:47.756 --> 52:49.542
farrace was just
working in there

52:49.841 --> 52:51.923
as one of the advertising
people, the assistants.

52:52.219 --> 52:54.585
farrace also was
one of these thinkers.

52:54.888 --> 52:56.378
and he came to me
one day and says,

52:56.682 --> 52:58.172
"we ought to have
a magazine for Tower,

52:58.475 --> 53:00.386
i've got an idea
what to call it: pulse."

53:00.686 --> 53:02.017
i said, "great, let's do it."

53:03.563 --> 53:05.224
[mike farrace]
working with chris,

53:05.524 --> 53:07.856
we hammered out this way
that the magazine would exist

53:08.151 --> 53:09.687
and when people
advertised in it,

53:09.987 --> 53:11.477
they would get a sale price
in the store,

53:11.780 --> 53:13.020
positioning in a rack,

53:13.323 --> 53:15.484
just the things
that really gave it the teeth.

53:15.784 --> 53:17.820
[steve]pulse was another
credibility thing for us.

53:18.120 --> 53:19.826
we could not only sell music,

53:20.122 --> 53:22.113
but we could write about it,
we could communicate about it.

53:22.416 --> 53:24.953
[Springsteen] I mean,
there was nothing and no one

53:25.252 --> 53:28.210
with the exception
of your rock fanzines

53:28.505 --> 53:32.418
and small columns in maybe
a few of the major newspapers

53:32.718 --> 53:35.004
that were interested
in what you were doing.

53:35.303 --> 53:36.839
there weren't that
many people interested

53:37.139 --> 53:39.130
in what 25Â—yearÂ—old kids
were doing with music.

53:39.433 --> 53:42.721
so you made your record,
you gave a few interviews

53:43.020 --> 53:46.308
to music publications,
and some daily newspapers,

53:46.606 --> 53:48.267
that was all there was to do.

53:48.567 --> 53:50.728
[steve]it was a very credible
music magazine,

53:51.028 --> 53:52.814
and it was a national
music magazine

53:53.113 --> 53:54.853
because of all
the markets we were in.

53:55.157 --> 53:58.445
and the magazine grew and
it was a really good magazine.

53:58.744 --> 54:00.029
but it was a great idea.

54:00.328 --> 54:01.943
I remember him
saying more than once,

54:02.247 --> 54:03.987
"just don't lose
too much money on it."

54:04.291 --> 54:05.872
and try to make something.

54:06.168 --> 54:09.331
it was the first time he really
focused on an idea I had.

54:09.629 --> 54:12.371
[russ]you'd listen
to the people who had ideas.

54:12.674 --> 54:13.914
the kids in the store,

54:14.217 --> 54:16.674
who I say invented
all kinds of ideas.

54:16.970 --> 54:18.506
everything we ever did
was invented

54:18.805 --> 54:20.386
by the kids in the store.

54:20.682 --> 54:23.765
the art on the walls,
the way they displayed things.

54:24.061 --> 54:27.224
their attitude about what to buy
and what not to buy.

54:27.522 --> 54:30.184
was all things happening
at the store level.

54:30.484 --> 54:32.816
the whole "no music, no life",
came out of japan.

54:33.111 --> 54:35.022
we adopted it,
brought it in, and used it.

54:35.322 --> 54:36.937
so we're using
their creativity.

54:37.240 --> 54:38.400
going,
"wow, this is interesting."

54:38.700 --> 54:40.156
or, "ah, that's too dark."

54:40.452 --> 54:41.817
and i'm going,
"no it's not, it's fun."

54:42.120 --> 54:43.530
no music, no life,
in this sort of

54:43.830 --> 54:45.536
snoopy, peanuts kind of script,

54:45.832 --> 54:47.242
i'm going,
"this is very cool."

54:47.542 --> 54:50.955
it was famous for
the record cover paintings

54:51.254 --> 54:53.996
that was jammed
on its walls outside.

54:54.299 --> 54:56.039
[bob delanoy]but that became
prominent.

54:56.343 --> 54:57.708
all of a sudden,
that became the norm

54:58.011 --> 54:59.547
for anywhere we had windows.

54:59.846 --> 55:02.087
they'd expect us
to put some displays.

55:02.390 --> 55:05.803
[springsteen]you aspired
to have your album

55:06.103 --> 55:08.310
part of that big mural
out there, you know.

55:08.605 --> 55:10.596
I mean, the board thing
was really cool,

55:10.899 --> 55:12.981
and then we took it inside
where we had an art dept.

55:13.276 --> 55:15.733
that was all foam core,
it wasn't just people
stapling albums up.

55:16.029 --> 55:17.485
people went to great lengths,

55:17.781 --> 55:20.614
like they'd get that
weird foam cardboard stuff

55:20.909 --> 55:22.865
and make a baby,
and then there's

55:23.161 --> 55:24.867
an actual dollar bill
dangling in front of it,

55:25.163 --> 55:27.028
and it looks like water
behind it, you know,

55:27.332 --> 55:29.869
and when you'd see people go
to that much trouble for you,

55:30.168 --> 55:31.157
for your band,

55:31.461 --> 55:34.248
we were just...
we were just shocked.

55:34.548 --> 55:37.005
I think that really
influenced and enhanced

55:37.300 --> 55:39.507
the experience people had
when they came in the store.

55:39.803 --> 55:41.839
the presentation of music...

55:43.890 --> 55:46.597
was physically exciting.

55:46.893 --> 55:48.224
[steve knopper]
they branded it, they made

55:48.520 --> 55:50.431
those red and yellow
logos and signs.

55:50.730 --> 55:53.096
and turned the idea that this
was your local record store

55:53.400 --> 55:55.265
into a national thing.

55:55.569 --> 55:57.935
[Mike Solomon] Tower was growing
at a faster and faster rate,

55:58.238 --> 55:59.728
was becoming more successful,

56:00.031 --> 56:03.194
and was becoming
more known or renowned.

56:03.493 --> 56:06.576
the employees at Tower
felt proud about that.

56:06.872 --> 56:08.362
we helped each other
make it work.

56:08.665 --> 56:11.623
we tried to get
the person below us promoted

56:11.918 --> 56:12.873
so that they could move on.

56:13.170 --> 56:14.580
I became a store manager.

56:14.880 --> 56:16.620
I became the regional director,

56:16.923 --> 56:18.959
i became vice president
of operations for the USA,

56:19.259 --> 56:20.624
i became vice president
and director

56:20.927 --> 56:22.508
of inÂ—store design
and development.

56:22.804 --> 56:25.045
[stan]we were really getting
into an expansion mode.

56:25.348 --> 56:28.681
it was quite a transition
from being store-centric

56:28.977 --> 56:31.559
to having to look
at the whole picture.

56:31.855 --> 56:34.847
but all those years
weren't wonderful years.

56:35.150 --> 56:36.765
i only remember this
because I was a young guy,

56:37.068 --> 56:38.649
and had to lay some people off
for the first time.

56:38.945 --> 56:41.357
'79, '81, and like '83
were years

56:41.656 --> 56:43.817
where the record companies were
actually laying people off.

56:44.117 --> 56:45.823
rock and roll,
which had been so exciting

56:46.119 --> 56:48.485
just 10 or 15
or 20 years earlier,

56:48.788 --> 56:51.621
kind of got to the point where
it was a little bit stagnant.

56:51.917 --> 56:53.373
the record labels, many of them,

56:53.668 --> 56:56.125
had put all their eggs
into the disco basket.

56:56.421 --> 56:58.707
a lot of radio stations
immediately changed formats

56:59.007 --> 57:01.168
in every big city there were
two or three disco stations

57:01.468 --> 57:03.208
that replaced
other formats of radio,

57:03.511 --> 57:05.593
and I think hurt
as disco didn't sell that well.

57:05.889 --> 57:08.175
there were a lot of layoffs,
record sales went way, way down,

57:08.475 --> 57:10.431
and some in the industry
that were really worried.

57:10.727 --> 57:14.561
it was all disco, and then
disco just one day crashed.

57:14.856 --> 57:17.393
you would up having these
djs to get attention,

57:17.692 --> 57:18.477
take advantage of it.

57:18.777 --> 57:19.812
"disco sucks, man."

57:20.111 --> 57:21.976
and so there was a recession.

57:22.280 --> 57:25.488
three things happened
that pulled the music industry

57:25.784 --> 57:27.820
out of its recession,
out of its doldrums.

57:28.119 --> 57:29.905
[engine roars]

57:30.205 --> 57:33.618
[electric guitar playing rock]

57:33.917 --> 57:35.202
one thing was mtv.

57:35.502 --> 57:37.117
turn it on,
leave it on.

57:37.420 --> 57:40.253
america, see the music
you want to see.

57:40.548 --> 57:42.084
i want my mtv.

57:42.384 --> 57:43.965
[steve]artists who'd been
somewhat successful

57:44.261 --> 57:46.843
could add a whole new visual
part of their careers.

57:47.138 --> 57:48.628
if you got your video on mtv,

57:48.932 --> 57:51.799
that directly had
a huge impact on sales.

57:52.102 --> 57:53.387
hi, mtv.

57:53.687 --> 57:55.097
[jim] I can remember clearly
signing off on

57:55.397 --> 57:58.685
video budgets
that were $700, $800,000.

57:58.984 --> 58:01.396
it was all important
that we get that thing on mtv

58:01.695 --> 58:03.105
and if we did,
boy we were off to the races.

58:03.405 --> 58:06.238
call your cable company and say,

58:06.533 --> 58:08.023
"i want my mtv!"

58:08.326 --> 58:11.193
the second thing was michael
jackson's thriller album.

58:11.496 --> 58:13.828
in the record industry,
there's a saying,
"hits save everything."

58:14.124 --> 58:16.365
and so thriller was
the proverbial rising tide

58:16.668 --> 58:17.953
that lifted all the boats.

58:18.253 --> 58:20.289
so many people went
into record stores,

58:20.588 --> 58:23.045
including Tower, tens of
millions of them at a time.

58:23.341 --> 58:24.956
and when they were in there,
they'd say,

58:25.260 --> 58:26.796
"oh, how about also
this lionel richie album,

58:27.095 --> 58:28.505
"and how about
this madonna album,

58:28.805 --> 58:30.841
and how about this springsteen,
and prince album?ii

58:31.141 --> 58:32.426
then the whole thing
started to lift.

58:32.726 --> 58:34.011
and then the third
and final thing,

58:34.311 --> 58:35.892
which was much more
of a prolonged thing

58:36.187 --> 58:38.143
was the adoption of the cd.

58:40.859 --> 58:43.145
it's hard to remember now,
because they seem
so antiquated,

58:43.445 --> 58:45.310
but cds for a while were cool.

58:45.613 --> 58:47.774
they were shiny and silver,
and state of the art,

58:48.074 --> 58:49.314
and they sounded perfect.

58:49.617 --> 58:51.073
they sounded pristine,
and that was something

58:51.369 --> 58:53.451
that we couldn't get
from our big, cumbersome lps.

58:53.747 --> 58:55.703
that was exciting
because it was digital

58:55.999 --> 58:58.741
and as much as I like
the sound of lps,

58:59.044 --> 59:01.080
the ticks and pops when
you were listening to classical

59:01.379 --> 59:03.210
used to just drive me
up the wall.

59:03.506 --> 59:05.497
so this thing was coming out,
and you'd go,

59:05.800 --> 59:08.587
"okay, well how do
we explain this to people?"

59:08.887 --> 59:10.423
how do we tell them
there's a whole,

59:10.722 --> 59:12.337
not only that there's a whole
new technology out there,

59:12.640 --> 59:14.471
but there's also
a reason to buy it,

59:14.768 --> 59:18.807
because there are enough cds
out there for you to buy.

59:19.105 --> 59:20.140
but you didn't know

59:20.440 --> 59:21.850
if the people
would adopt it or not.

59:22.150 --> 59:24.607
the executives at labels
resisted the cd,

59:24.903 --> 59:26.109
they wanted
no part of it at all.

59:26.404 --> 59:29.191
they were worried
that it'd create piracy.

59:29.491 --> 59:31.072
but russ persevered
th rough that,

59:31.368 --> 59:35.953
and he was the first, biggest,
best champion of the cd.

59:36.247 --> 59:37.737
[russ]it is so clean.

59:38.041 --> 59:40.532
i'm very conscious
of high quality sound.

59:40.835 --> 59:42.700
he always said that
that was going to be

59:43.004 --> 59:44.369
the savior of the retail store.

59:44.672 --> 59:46.754
these new, innovative,
high end,

59:47.050 --> 59:48.836
super great sounding discs.

59:49.135 --> 59:50.215
[steve knopper]
everybody, it turns out,

59:50.512 --> 59:52.002
was getting tired of the lp,

59:52.305 --> 59:54.296
and they were ready to replace
their record collections

59:54.599 --> 59:56.715
on this more expensive product
called the cd.

59:57.018 --> 59:58.679
i mean that was a huge piece
of the record business

59:58.978 --> 01:00:01.469
was people replacing
their catalogs with cds.

01:00:01.773 --> 01:00:03.809
look at this cool new thing.

01:00:04.109 --> 01:00:05.645
where can I buy it?
Tower Records.

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:10.065
as an experiment,
the Tower store

01:00:10.365 --> 01:00:11.650
on sunset boulevard
in los angeles

01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:13.611
has installed
a bin full of cds.

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:15.446
[steve knopper]they realized
the cd was much more expensive.

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:17.656
and it would push up
that price point

01:00:17.956 --> 01:00:19.947
up to maybe $15.99 or $16.99,

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:22.161
which was a god send
for the record industry

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.826
at that time,
and Tower took advantage of it.

01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:27.416
[electronic
hip hop music playing]

01:00:30.009 --> 01:00:31.874
i pump up the volume,
pump up the volume i

01:00:32.178 --> 01:00:33.964
i pump up the volume,
check it out... i

01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:36.971
[male reporter]by 1988 though,
cassette sales nearly doubled,

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:39.804
cds had exploded,
and the market for vinyl lps

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:42.594
had shrunk
by nearly two thirds.

01:00:42.897 --> 01:00:44.808
so it was exciting
for the record company,

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:45.972
it was exciting
for the consumer,

01:00:46.276 --> 01:00:48.312
and for the artist.

01:00:48.611 --> 01:00:51.318
all of a sudden, you sold
you were rich.

01:00:51.614 --> 01:00:53.821
[steve knopper]all of this
flowed from the fact that

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:56.859
the cd was selling so well.

01:00:57.162 --> 01:00:58.868
and Tower, of course
benefited from that,

01:00:59.164 --> 01:01:00.779
they were part
of that culture too.

01:01:01.082 --> 01:01:02.788
[male reporter]in response
to this consumer defection,

01:01:03.084 --> 01:01:05.120
a number of major record stores
have removed vinyl albums

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:07.126
from their shelves altogether.

01:01:07.422 --> 01:01:09.538
so, is vinyl dead?

01:01:09.841 --> 01:01:11.206
[female reporter]
today's popular music

01:01:11.509 --> 01:01:12.965
is more diverse
than ever before,

01:01:13.261 --> 01:01:15.593
and selection is
at an all-time high.

01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:17.174
but the cost
of pre-recorded music

01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:18.759
has also reached new levels,

01:01:19.058 --> 01:01:20.548
causing customers to be wary

01:01:20.852 --> 01:01:23.093
of purchasing unknown artists
and musical styles.

01:01:23.396 --> 01:01:26.308
Tower and the record labels
were doing this dance on price

01:01:26.608 --> 01:01:29.850
that suppliers
and wholesalers often do

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:33.111
which is sort of:
"where will the consumer break?"

01:01:33.406 --> 01:01:34.862
to combat this problem,

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:37.365
Tower has introduced
their new cd listening stations

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.571
in its retail
locations worldwide,

01:01:39.871 --> 01:01:42.658
and the public's reaction
has been tremendous.

01:01:42.957 --> 01:01:45.699
but I think where russ said
and where Tower Records said,
they were just like,

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:48.789
" every christmas
the records cost more,
and they're selling more."

01:01:49.088 --> 01:01:50.828
what's not to like?

01:01:51.132 --> 01:01:53.088
[russ on tv]
our stores are bigger,
they're better stocked,

01:01:53.384 --> 01:01:54.590
they have
more knowledgeable people.

01:01:54.886 --> 01:01:56.547
competition will
take care of itself.

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:59.212
[interviewer] that's it, russ,
you can open more stores now.

01:01:59.516 --> 01:02:01.222
i pump up the volume,
pump up the volume i

01:02:01.518 --> 01:02:04.885
i pump up the volume,
dance dance... i

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:07.600
[steve]
russ had a serious amount
of power, for a long time.

01:02:07.899 --> 01:02:09.480
there were always
a lot of record chains,

01:02:09.776 --> 01:02:11.141
but Tower was, I think
the most powerful one

01:02:11.444 --> 01:02:13.150
for a long period of time.

01:02:13.446 --> 01:02:15.061
[male reporter]
recently, Tower Records
was again recognized

01:02:15.365 --> 01:02:17.697
as u.s. music retailer
of the year by narm,

01:02:17.992 --> 01:02:20.324
the national association
of recording merchandisers.

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:22.156
this makes the fourth
time that Tower's received

01:02:22.455 --> 01:02:23.945
this prestigious award.

01:02:24.249 --> 01:02:25.955
the honor was bestowed
in recognition of Tower's

01:02:26.251 --> 01:02:28.913
high profile image, marketing
and merchandising strength,

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:31.123
and fiscal responsibility.

01:02:33.341 --> 01:02:35.423
so starting in 1984,
you had michael jackson,

01:02:35.718 --> 01:02:37.379
and madonna, and bruce
springsteen, and prince,

01:02:37.679 --> 01:02:39.135
and then you had
the hair metal bands

01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:41.091
and then you had
the grunge era,

01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:43.097
and then you had
hootie and the blowfish,

01:02:43.393 --> 01:02:45.008
and then you had
this entire period

01:02:45.311 --> 01:02:47.176
'84 to 2000,
it's no coincidence

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.391
that hip hop had
its booming growth

01:02:49.691 --> 01:02:50.931
during this period.

01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:52.940
then you had boy bands
and britney spears

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:55.443
and christina aguilera,
and all th ese acts

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:58.104
that took advantage of teen
pop stuff that was big.

01:02:58.408 --> 01:03:00.148
so it was just
one bomb exploding

01:03:00.451 --> 01:03:02.407
after another in music.

01:03:02.704 --> 01:03:03.864
Tower was the center of it all.

01:03:04.163 --> 01:03:05.619
if they're paying
by credit card,

01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:09.874
the register sets the charge
in a matter of seconds.

01:03:10.169 --> 01:03:11.033
you make that kind of money,

01:03:11.337 --> 01:03:12.417
you want to hang on to it.

01:03:12.714 --> 01:03:16.957
Tower, Tower again, and again.

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.545
[male tv announcer]
all the music is stuck

01:03:18.845 --> 01:03:20.585
in this completely
warped galaxy,

01:03:20.888 --> 01:03:22.469
but then Tower goes
and gets it back,

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:25.051
and opens stores
all over your planet.

01:03:25.351 --> 01:03:28.809
Tower Records, more
music for less money.

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:31.187
[steve knopper]and it was
just overwhelmingly big.
everybody knew the logo.

01:03:31.482 --> 01:03:32.892
everybody knew the
red and yellow bag.

01:03:33.192 --> 01:03:34.523
[man]when the digital
revolution came,

01:03:34.819 --> 01:03:36.150
you know the record
business jumped on it

01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:40.485
with the cd,
not realizing that they were

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:42.398
really causing their own demise.

01:03:42.702 --> 01:03:44.909
[Knopper] But I definitely think
that Tower was optimistic,

01:03:45.204 --> 01:03:46.159
and they felt like
the good times would last

01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:47.571
for a good long time.

01:03:47.874 --> 01:03:49.364
i mean they expanded
during this period.

01:03:49.667 --> 01:03:51.623
[mike]well, by the early '9os,
we were having

01:03:51.919 --> 01:03:53.910
pretty good success
in our foreign operations.

01:03:54.213 --> 01:03:55.544
again, it was driven by japan,

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:58.001
which was extremely profitable.

01:03:58.301 --> 01:04:01.919
maybe more so than the
domestic company in america.

01:04:02.221 --> 01:04:03.836
[russ]we moved
the old shibuya store

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:06.176
to this new shibuya store,
it was an eight story building.

01:04:06.476 --> 01:04:08.182
84,000 feet.

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:10.560
each floor was
a segmented store.

01:04:10.855 --> 01:04:13.562
and the place was doing
hundreds of hundreds

01:04:13.858 --> 01:04:15.189
of thousands
of dollars a month.

01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:18.397
i mean, it was a huge
success. [chuckles]

01:04:18.696 --> 01:04:19.776
you couldn't stop 'em.

01:04:20.073 --> 01:04:22.940
it gave us a lot of confidence.

01:04:23.242 --> 01:04:24.527
somebody came
from england and said,

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:26.112
"why don't you
have a store in england?"

01:04:26.412 --> 01:04:27.902
howdy, i'm russ solomon.

01:04:28.206 --> 01:04:30.322
i want to take this opportunity
to welcome all of you

01:04:30.625 --> 01:04:32.161
to our little
spot in central london,

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.200
and I hope you're going
to have a great time tonight

01:04:34.504 --> 01:04:38.122
seeing what is tonight,
the marriage of wembley
and Tower.

01:04:38.424 --> 01:04:39.709
two great names
in entertainment.

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:41.499
so drink up
and have a great time.

01:04:41.803 --> 01:04:43.418
i'm doin' it.

01:04:43.721 --> 01:04:45.803
[russ] and then in japan,
the guy that we sent to japan

01:04:46.099 --> 01:04:49.387
a few years later, makes a
contact with somebody in taiwan

01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:50.892
to make a partnership

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:53.303
for hong kong and taiwan
and singapore.

01:04:53.606 --> 01:04:55.972
the company was
really getting big.

01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:01.277
[steve nikkel]we were doing
business on a very high level.

01:05:01.572 --> 01:05:03.108
but you never escaped
this thing that

01:05:03.408 --> 01:05:05.239
wow, it's like,
i'm sitting in an ex-pat bar

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:07.366
at 2:00 in the morning
in taipei,

01:05:07.662 --> 01:05:10.074
you know,
and i'm from sacramento.

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:11.408
how cool is this?

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:14.996
moving to countries
outside of japan

01:05:15.294 --> 01:05:16.283
was a risk.

01:05:16.587 --> 01:05:17.417
they expanded
in latin america,

01:05:17.714 --> 01:05:20.046
in asia, and all over the place.

01:05:20.341 --> 01:05:22.548
[woman] can you give
the fans message tonight?

01:05:22.844 --> 01:05:24.675
no music, no life.

01:05:24.971 --> 01:05:27.257
[mike]we were becoming
famous worldwide,

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:29.047
and we enjoyed that.

01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:30.339
why, I suppose
it stroked our egos

01:05:30.643 --> 01:05:31.428
to a certain point.

01:05:31.728 --> 01:05:32.934
it was fucking awesome.

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:35.561
i mean, come on. [laughs]

01:05:35.857 --> 01:05:39.315
i mean, my gosh,
it was a mind blower.

01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:40.565
it was really fun.

01:05:40.862 --> 01:05:42.773
we got to know
more about music

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:45.154
going in to mexico city,
going in to colombia,

01:05:45.450 --> 01:05:47.486
and buenos aires,
it allowed us to know

01:05:47.785 --> 01:05:49.491
a lot more about latin music.

01:05:49.787 --> 01:05:51.948
but we weren't really successful

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:54.739
in any of the other countries
we went into.

01:05:55.042 --> 01:05:56.202
therein lies the tale.

01:05:56.502 --> 01:05:58.288
you know sometimes,
i guess, one can get

01:05:58.588 --> 01:06:00.249
a little too big
for their britches.

01:06:00.548 --> 01:06:02.379
like I said,
there was this culture

01:06:02.675 --> 01:06:04.711
that was growing
that wherever we wanted

01:06:05.011 --> 01:06:06.922
to put a store,
build it and they will come,

01:06:07.221 --> 01:06:08.586
field of dreams bullshit.

01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:10.881
there was no due diligence,
for christ sakes,

01:06:11.184 --> 01:06:14.176
done on buenos aires
or mexico city.

01:06:14.479 --> 01:06:17.141
i said borrow
all that damn money.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.227
i'm as guilty about
that as anybody else.

01:06:20.526 --> 01:06:23.017
i'm stupid for saying yes

01:06:23.321 --> 01:06:25.061
to partnerships in argentina

01:06:25.364 --> 01:06:27.320
even though I didn't
totally believe in 'em.

01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:30.700
[mike solomon]bud did not want
the company to go in to
so much debt.

01:06:30.995 --> 01:06:32.781
he would succumb
to the pressure that russ

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:36.038
put on him,
although he was happy enough,

01:06:36.334 --> 01:06:37.449
especially because he was making

01:06:37.752 --> 01:06:38.832
a lot of money, personally.

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:40.334
if you look
at the music industry

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:42.791
at any given point
during that period

01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:45.957
from '84 to 2000,
you wouldn't really go,

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:48.672
"oh no, there's choppy
waters on the horizon."

01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:50.256
russ, what about
these new technologies

01:06:50.556 --> 01:06:53.889
like the mini disc, dcc,
or beaming music and video

01:06:54.185 --> 01:06:55.345
right in to my house?

01:06:55.645 --> 01:06:57.260
are my cds history,
and will your inventory

01:06:57.563 --> 01:06:59.019
at Tower become obsolete?

01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:00.521
there's so many new technologies

01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:02.307
we simply get
involved with them.

01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:03.690
we get involved with them

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:05.522
at the early part
of their development

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:08.154
and we grow with 'em,
or when they die,

01:07:08.449 --> 01:07:10.781
we throw them out like d.a.t.

01:07:11.077 --> 01:07:12.658
as for the whole concept
of beaming something

01:07:12.954 --> 01:07:16.412
in to one's home,
that may come along someday,

01:07:16.707 --> 01:07:18.538
that's for sure,
but it will come along

01:07:18.835 --> 01:07:20.575
over a long period of time,
and we'll be able

01:07:20.878 --> 01:07:22.493
to deal with it
and change our focus

01:07:22.797 --> 01:07:24.412
and change the way
we do business

01:07:24.715 --> 01:07:27.127
to deal with the
situation as it really is.

01:07:27.426 --> 01:07:28.632
as far as your cd collection,

01:07:28.928 --> 01:07:31.214
and our cd inventory
for that matter,

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:34.176
it's going to be around
for a long, long time,
believe me.

01:07:34.475 --> 01:07:35.965
[russ]when you look back
on all your mistakes,

01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:37.725
and you make 'em,
that's for sure,

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:40.261
it just, it catches up with ya,

01:07:40.565 --> 01:07:42.101
is what the truth of it is.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.267
you think you're
going to be all right,

01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:46.730
and when it catches up with ya,

01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:49.395
then it's too late
to do anything about it.

01:07:49.699 --> 01:07:51.405
[mike solomon]the business had
grown significantly.

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:53.362
it was an
international business.

01:07:53.661 --> 01:07:56.778
sales were running close
to a billion dollars
by that time,

01:07:57.081 --> 01:07:59.743
and bud the accountant
was possibly

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:01.248
a little bit over his head.

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:03.910
we had to hire a guy
from the outside.

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:05.453
fellow by the name
of dee searson.

01:08:05.756 --> 01:08:08.418
[russ]because I had
complete trust in bud,

01:08:08.718 --> 01:08:10.583
i had also complete
trust with dee.

01:08:10.887 --> 01:08:13.253
[mike solomon]by the early
19903, the relationship

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:16.593
between bud and russ had
become a little bit strained.

01:08:16.893 --> 01:08:19.930
bud stopped going
to the daily lunches,

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:21.514
they were giving him ulcers.

01:08:21.814 --> 01:08:26.148
bud's job became less
and less important.

01:08:26.444 --> 01:08:27.774
he finally had to leave.

01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:32.404
so it was around 1995
that bud decided to retire.

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.533
russ will,
even to this day, will say

01:08:35.828 --> 01:08:37.613
that that's one of the things
that went wrong

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:41.532
when bud was kind of eased out.

01:08:41.834 --> 01:08:43.790
[rudy danzinger]! think bud
was that kind of person

01:08:44.086 --> 01:08:45.622
they felt as though
something's going to happen.

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.662
the company won't,
will not be the same.

01:08:47.965 --> 01:08:51.082
when bud left,
dee took over as the cfo.

01:08:51.385 --> 01:08:53.671
[russ]i'm developing a company
and expanding a company,

01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:57.259
he's managing the money,
and it was a surprise to me

01:08:57.558 --> 01:08:59.048
that I couldn't
use all that money

01:08:59.352 --> 01:09:00.716
to open new stores.

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.885
[mike solomon]dee was put
on a mission to go out

01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:06.898
and get money
by Tower selling bonds.

01:09:07.193 --> 01:09:10.401
well, it made it
easier for Tower

01:09:10.696 --> 01:09:12.778
to borrow more money.

01:09:13.073 --> 01:09:14.689
things became much more tense.

01:09:14.992 --> 01:09:16.528
we had pressure from creditors,

01:09:16.827 --> 01:09:19.033
from bond holders, from banks,

01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:21.867
and there was pressure
in the business in general.

01:09:22.166 --> 01:09:24.497
a perfect storm
of events was developing

01:09:24.794 --> 01:09:27.376
in the music
industry as a whole.

01:09:27.671 --> 01:09:30.334
[jim urie]we'd gone from vinyl
singles, to cassette singles,

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:33.045
to cd singles,
but we cut that out

01:09:33.344 --> 01:09:35.426
because we felt
like, rightfully so,

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:36.756
why were we letting people buy

01:09:37.055 --> 01:09:38.341
the best song off an album,

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.881
let's just not make
that available,

01:09:41.185 --> 01:09:42.390
and they'll have
to buy the album.

01:09:42.687 --> 01:09:44.051
and at that day and time,
it was true.

01:09:44.354 --> 01:09:46.345
an eventually,
i think people were kind of

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:47.889
crying foul about that,

01:09:48.192 --> 01:09:50.808
like okay, I like a couple
of britney spears songs,

01:09:51.112 --> 01:09:53.694
but do I really want to buy
her whole record for $18?

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:55.355
you know,
it was the peak of that.

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:57.569
[russ]there was no need
for a whole generation

01:09:57.868 --> 01:09:59.108
of kids to even go
in a record store

01:09:59.412 --> 01:10:00.902
to get their music.

01:10:01.205 --> 01:10:02.786
if you haven't got kids
coming into record stores

01:10:03.082 --> 01:10:05.448
to buy records, heh,
you've lost a lot.

01:10:05.751 --> 01:10:08.458
[jim urie]but then a whole
bunch of other things
started to happen.

01:10:08.754 --> 01:10:11.040
you had
all these mass merchants

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.625
getting
into the music business.

01:10:12.925 --> 01:10:15.507
and there were horrible,
horrible price wars.

01:10:15.803 --> 01:10:18.135
everybody and their brother
started selling cds.

01:10:18.431 --> 01:10:20.763
you know target, wal-mart,
all these companies.

01:10:21.058 --> 01:10:22.639
and they would sell 'em at cost.

01:10:22.935 --> 01:10:26.519
what that took away from us was
the traffic created by the hits.

01:10:26.814 --> 01:10:28.770
if you had a Tower Records
in some market,

01:10:29.066 --> 01:10:30.806
and a best buy moved
across the street,

01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:32.771
the music consumer would go,
"hey, here's the Tower

01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:34.856
on my right where I can
buy the cd for 20 bucks,

01:10:35.156 --> 01:10:36.612
and here's
the best buy on the left

01:10:36.907 --> 01:10:38.192
where I could buy
the cd for 10 bucks."

01:10:38.492 --> 01:10:40.653
even before napster,
that was a big problem.

01:10:40.953 --> 01:10:45.117
the industry as a whole
didn't respond appropriately

01:10:45.416 --> 01:10:46.872
to what was happening.

01:10:47.168 --> 01:10:49.625
what they should have done was
make the records cheaper.

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.002
they could have,
but they didn't.

01:10:52.298 --> 01:10:54.584
and I remember vividly the very
first story on,

01:10:54.884 --> 01:10:57.375
"what is an mp3?",
you know, that we ever did.

01:10:57.678 --> 01:10:59.259
i wasn't depressed
the first time I saw napster.

01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:01.216
actually, I remember it
very clearly,

01:11:01.515 --> 01:11:04.723
and I went on and there were
800,000 people on it.

01:11:05.019 --> 01:11:06.259
and I thought, "wow,

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:08.302
this is unbelievable.
this is fantastic."

01:11:08.606 --> 01:11:11.473
i wasn't thinking
that those 800,000 people

01:11:11.776 --> 01:11:12.640
were stealing from me, heh.

01:11:12.943 --> 01:11:14.524
it was the most amazing

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:16.776
piece of software in history.

01:11:17.073 --> 01:11:18.734
there was community in it.

01:11:19.033 --> 01:11:21.365
you could look at each
others lists, playlists.

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:22.900
it was just a natural.

01:11:23.204 --> 01:11:25.286
[steve nikkel]
mike farrace literally had

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:27.867
the first record store online.

01:11:28.167 --> 01:11:29.953
but we didn't know
what to do with it.

01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:32.413
in fact, our store was on aol.

01:11:33.881 --> 01:11:35.246
talk about lame.

01:11:35.549 --> 01:11:37.210
developing that into retail

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:40.126
wasn't really something
that was on my radar.

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:42.215
but when you realized
how easy it was

01:11:42.515 --> 01:11:45.473
for people to share files
and just literally

01:11:45.768 --> 01:11:48.510
take music for free,
that's a problem.

01:11:48.813 --> 01:11:50.394
how do you compete with that?

01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:54.147
if you could get coca-cola
for free from your faucet,

01:11:54.443 --> 01:11:55.979
you wouldn't buy
a bottle of coca-cola.

01:11:56.278 --> 01:11:58.269
on one hand, you go, okay,
well what's the big deal?

01:11:58.572 --> 01:11:59.857
singles are cheap,

01:12:00.157 --> 01:12:01.317
we don't really need that
much money anyway.

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:03.357
on the other hand,
when napster came out

01:12:03.661 --> 01:12:06.824
the big issue was,
"how do you compete with free?"

01:12:07.123 --> 01:12:08.488
on one hand,
you have all these people

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:09.871
who are stealing music
for free,

01:12:10.167 --> 01:12:13.250
on the other hand,
we have this $18 cd,

01:12:13.546 --> 01:12:17.038
which is our main product.
not really a balance.

01:12:17.341 --> 01:12:20.048
but if you have a single,
if you have a 99-cent single,

01:12:20.344 --> 01:12:21.584
or a cheap way of,
an alternative way

01:12:21.887 --> 01:12:23.718
of selling music,
that's a little easier

01:12:24.014 --> 01:12:25.470
to compete with free.

01:12:25.766 --> 01:12:27.802
and we of course saw that later
because itunes kicked in,

01:12:28.102 --> 01:12:29.888
and songs cost 99 cents
and it did very well.

01:12:30.187 --> 01:12:32.644
they think music is available
on the computer,

01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:34.146
go google it,

01:12:34.441 --> 01:12:35.977
and they think they can
just get it for free.

01:12:36.277 --> 01:12:38.359
and that was something
that was discussed

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:40.440
at nauseam with Russ and Tower.

01:12:40.739 --> 01:12:42.525
he believed that there would
always be people

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:44.861
wanting to buy records
to have a collection,

01:12:45.161 --> 01:12:47.197
a library,
if you will, of product.

01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:49.612
those people died
off and went away,

01:12:49.915 --> 01:12:51.576
and the generation that followed

01:12:51.876 --> 01:12:56.210
believes that having an ipad,
that's your music collection.

01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:58.666
that's what it is today,
and that's the truth.

01:12:58.966 --> 01:13:01.878
there's no records.
go buy a record, are you nuts?

01:13:02.178 --> 01:13:04.590
and so that kind
of started leaving

01:13:04.889 --> 01:13:06.550
the terrestrial retailers behind

01:13:06.849 --> 01:13:07.884
because that kind of stuff,

01:13:08.184 --> 01:13:10.300
it's just too easy,
too convenient.

01:13:10.603 --> 01:13:12.309
i mean I still enjoy
going in to a record store,

01:13:12.605 --> 01:13:14.220
but I can't tell you
the last time I did.

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:17.606
did the industry push people
a little bit

01:13:17.902 --> 01:13:21.440
to piracy by forcing them
to buy albums

01:13:21.739 --> 01:13:23.024
when they only wanted a song?

01:13:23.324 --> 01:13:24.939
i can't say that that
is true or not true

01:13:25.242 --> 01:13:27.278
but you could certainly
make that argument.

01:13:27.578 --> 01:13:30.411
and so what became apparent
was the music industry
is changing

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:33.698
and we are not able
to adjust to that change.

01:13:34.001 --> 01:13:36.868
you could couch that as we're
not adjusting to that change,

01:13:37.171 --> 01:13:39.662
or we don't know how
to adjust to that change,

01:13:39.965 --> 01:13:42.456
but I think you're doing
all of those things at once.

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.126
right when...

01:13:45.429 --> 01:13:46.669
we probably could have changed,

01:13:46.972 --> 01:13:49.008
in my mind,
it was out of my control.

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:53.809
but my getting sick
didn't help matters any.

01:13:54.104 --> 01:13:55.765
in 1998,
a couple of things happened.

01:13:56.065 --> 01:13:59.182
one, my father had

01:13:59.485 --> 01:14:02.522
an eightÂ—way
bypass heart operation,

01:14:02.821 --> 01:14:05.984
and he was out of the picture
most of that year.

01:14:06.283 --> 01:14:08.490
i was appointed ceo.

01:14:08.786 --> 01:14:10.242
russ was kicked up to chairman.

01:14:10.537 --> 01:14:13.119
stanley, chris hopson,
dee searson and i

01:14:13.415 --> 01:14:14.996
were equals,
then all of a sudden,

01:14:15.292 --> 01:14:16.623
i'm kicked up to ceo.

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:20.002
that created some
strain and difficulty.

01:14:20.297 --> 01:14:23.130
i knew michael somewhat.
i didn't like it.

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:25.757
he didn't come up from--
you know, the one thing

01:14:26.053 --> 01:14:27.884
that historically that was
about Tower Records,

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:31.547
is we all started
and came up, and learned it

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:33.090
by living it, and doing it.

01:14:33.394 --> 01:14:34.759
and that was pretty much
the case

01:14:35.062 --> 01:14:38.896
working for Tower before
i went to law school.

01:14:39.191 --> 01:14:41.773
when I came back to Tower
in 1988,

01:14:42.069 --> 01:14:46.529
i came in as a senior vice
president and legal counsel,

01:14:46.824 --> 01:14:49.236
and I was immediately tagged

01:14:49.535 --> 01:14:51.366
as the boss' son.

01:14:51.662 --> 01:14:54.699
there were people
who wanted to sabotage me.

01:14:54.999 --> 01:14:57.741
[russ] and mike was good,
but the truth of it is,

01:14:58.043 --> 01:14:59.954
he wasn't me,
in the same sense of

01:15:00.254 --> 01:15:03.587
being able to run
what we wanted to run.

01:15:03.882 --> 01:15:05.418
russell had a persona about him

01:15:05.718 --> 01:15:08.505
that people embrace,
michael didn't.

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:10.510
it was a challenge to...

01:15:12.057 --> 01:15:14.799
...get the trust and cooperation

01:15:15.102 --> 01:15:17.388
of my executive colleagues.

01:15:17.688 --> 01:15:20.680
another thing started
happening around 2000.

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:22.894
sales were flattening.

01:15:23.193 --> 01:15:26.526
we had had growth
from 1960 to 2000.

01:15:26.822 --> 01:15:28.904
there was never
a year that there was

01:15:29.199 --> 01:15:30.780
no steady growth in sales.

01:15:31.076 --> 01:15:32.782
this became problematic,

01:15:33.078 --> 01:15:36.866
having a large debt
and a large interest payment,

01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:40.784
and that's sort of where
Tower started going down.

01:15:41.086 --> 01:15:43.919
[stan]everything
you've touched worked,

01:15:44.214 --> 01:15:45.875
and then it stops.

01:15:46.175 --> 01:15:47.756
it was just dumb.

01:15:48.052 --> 01:15:49.838
the business plan didn't work.

01:15:50.137 --> 01:15:51.718
there was no population
to support it.

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:53.174
it's that simple.

01:15:53.474 --> 01:15:55.430
you've borrowed
all this damn money,

01:15:55.726 --> 01:15:57.637
and all of a sudden,
you become aware

01:15:57.936 --> 01:15:59.176
that you've gone too far.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:01.186
everything's working
well in japan,

01:16:01.482 --> 01:16:02.722
but because you've lost money

01:16:03.025 --> 01:16:04.435
in all these other places,

01:16:04.735 --> 01:16:06.817
and the bank is forcing
you to do something,

01:16:07.112 --> 01:16:08.898
the bank is forcing
you to sell japan.

01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:11.405
japan was making
all kinds of money.

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.736
i mean, selling japan
was a terrible loss.

01:16:18.874 --> 01:16:20.364
[steve]
they expanded too much.

01:16:20.667 --> 01:16:23.830
that hurt them whether there
had been a napster or not.

01:16:24.129 --> 01:16:25.619
the fact that there was
a napster later

01:16:25.923 --> 01:16:26.878
sort of was the death blow.

01:16:27.174 --> 01:16:28.880
[phone ringing]

01:16:29.176 --> 01:16:30.962
well, here's russ now.

01:16:31.261 --> 01:16:32.171
i'm being interviewed.

01:16:34.014 --> 01:16:35.424
[russ]bud martin.

01:16:35.724 --> 01:16:38.340
if bud had not gotten sick
and died on me,

01:16:38.644 --> 01:16:40.760
for crying out loud,
and i'd have listened to him,

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:42.303
i wouldn't have been
in the problems

01:16:42.606 --> 01:16:44.471
that I had later on,
i'll tell ya.

01:16:46.527 --> 01:16:49.234
[rudy]people appreciated
what bud did eventually.

01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:52.317
bud was a cool guy,
and I know when a few drinks,

01:16:52.616 --> 01:16:55.232
the old story about him
swinging on chandeliers

01:16:55.536 --> 01:16:58.494
at the red lion, putting
lampshades on his head

01:16:58.789 --> 01:17:01.576
running around, but they felt
like he was the rock

01:17:01.875 --> 01:17:03.160
of the company also.

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:05.826
he was the guy
that took care of business.

01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:07.711
[russ]he got older
and sicker is all.

01:17:08.006 --> 01:17:10.839
he had an illness,
which he had for a long time.

01:17:14.805 --> 01:17:18.263
[mike]he had not really told
anybody by the early '9os,

01:17:18.559 --> 01:17:22.302
but he was suffering from
a debilitating illness,

01:17:22.604 --> 01:17:25.971
leukemia, which,
unbeknownst to most of us,

01:17:26.275 --> 01:17:29.767
he had had for...
maybe 15 years.

01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:31.276
he had a good life.

01:17:31.572 --> 01:17:33.608
it was sad at the end
when it ended.

01:17:33.907 --> 01:17:36.148
he didn't have much
at all to speak of.

01:17:38.579 --> 01:17:40.865
[mike]it was only
a couple of years later

01:17:41.165 --> 01:17:42.780
that he passed away.

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.832
[heidi]
anyway, I have a couple things
i want to say about bud.

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:52.498
i may not get this
out right, excuse me.

01:17:55.262 --> 01:17:57.127
i wasn't going to do this.

01:17:57.431 --> 01:18:00.047
he really taught all of us,
us young kids

01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:01.556
who are now vice presidents

01:18:01.852 --> 01:18:03.262
to take a look

01:18:03.562 --> 01:18:05.974
at what we were
doing with our lives

01:18:06.273 --> 01:18:09.015
as far as
our morality was concerned.

01:18:09.318 --> 01:18:11.684
he was a wonderful
teacher to us.

01:18:11.987 --> 01:18:13.318
he was an incredible sexist pig,

01:18:13.614 --> 01:18:15.696
but at the same time
he was entirely fair.

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:18.198
so after that, I only have one
thing more to say.

01:18:18.494 --> 01:18:20.030
if I can get this out.

01:18:20.329 --> 01:18:21.990
[sniffles] sorry.

01:18:22.289 --> 01:18:24.871
okay. bud, baby,

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:26.998
this one's for you.

01:18:27.294 --> 01:18:28.659
[russ]bud martin.

01:18:28.962 --> 01:18:32.170
bud, of all people, was making
things possible to do.

01:18:34.051 --> 01:18:36.417
you know, after all
of those 26 years,

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.382
probably the last
three years were spent

01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:42.798
feeling that the whole idea
of Tower Records

01:18:43.101 --> 01:18:44.966
was not going to be
around much longer.

01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:48.228
at the end, for me,
it was just a matter of when.

01:18:48.524 --> 01:18:49.730
when the banks came in,

01:18:50.025 --> 01:18:51.014
we knew that things
were going to change.

01:18:51.318 --> 01:18:53.354
it was, it was...

01:18:55.322 --> 01:18:56.607
my father...

01:18:59.409 --> 01:19:01.570
when the banks started
putting pressure

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:04.486
on the company
and insisting that we hire

01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:07.953
a restructuring officer
to run the company,

01:19:08.252 --> 01:19:09.583
my father

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:11.368
became very upset.

01:19:13.131 --> 01:19:15.838
[russ]
the bank broke me that news.

01:19:16.134 --> 01:19:18.125
and I said, "i don't think
it's a good idea. "

01:19:18.428 --> 01:19:20.089
they said,
"well this is your choice,

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:21.424
"you either bring
in new management

01:19:21.723 --> 01:19:23.554
or we don't loan you the money."

01:19:23.850 --> 01:19:25.511
so I say, "okay,
we need the money.

01:19:25.811 --> 01:19:28.473
we have to have the money,
or we can't operate at all,

01:19:28.772 --> 01:19:32.356
so okay, we'll try to bring
in new management."

01:19:32.651 --> 01:19:35.108
mike goes down
to hire this woman,

01:19:35.404 --> 01:19:37.395
betsy burton,
he wants to hire her.

01:19:37.698 --> 01:19:40.064
[bob delanoy]these new bodies
were in. I think it was betsy,

01:19:40.367 --> 01:19:41.607
i didn't even know

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:43.116
what was going on
in the company at the time.

01:19:43.412 --> 01:19:45.403
her idea was to spend all this

01:19:45.706 --> 01:19:49.164
marketing money on branding,
and you're just going,

01:19:49.459 --> 01:19:51.415
"why are you going to spend
this money on branding?

01:19:51.712 --> 01:19:53.077
we're already
established as a brand.

01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:55.336
what you need is retail ads.

01:19:55.632 --> 01:19:57.964
you need ads that
are going to move product.

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:00.216
you need to move product.
that's the bottom line."

01:20:00.512 --> 01:20:03.424
and then she closed
down pulse magazine.

01:20:03.724 --> 01:20:07.512
[mike]losing pulse, firing
30 or 40 employees,

01:20:07.811 --> 01:20:09.176
was heartbreaking.

01:20:09.479 --> 01:20:13.188
if I ever came close
to wanting to kill somebody,

01:20:13.483 --> 01:20:15.895
with my hands, it was her.

01:20:16.194 --> 01:20:18.230
[mike]we closed
our print shop, I believe,

01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:21.192
and to lose 30 employees.

01:20:21.491 --> 01:20:24.528
we closed our sign shop
and lost 30 employees.

01:20:24.828 --> 01:20:27.615
we had to make cuts every place.
we had to fire people.

01:20:27.914 --> 01:20:30.621
and that is where you just
had the two feelings of,

01:20:30.917 --> 01:20:33.283
"i'm so good, i'm not going
to be gone, I hope."

01:20:33.587 --> 01:20:35.623
the restructuring officers
were coming in and saying,

01:20:35.922 --> 01:20:37.207
" look, you gotta cut
your expenses

01:20:37.507 --> 01:20:38.872
because you don't have
any money."

01:20:39.176 --> 01:20:40.586
in a way, they were
saying the same thing

01:20:40.886 --> 01:20:43.628
that bud was saying
for the last four decades.

01:20:43.930 --> 01:20:46.717
you know, I had
the one side of my mouth

01:20:47.017 --> 01:20:49.053
sit with him
and try to figure out

01:20:49.353 --> 01:20:51.309
growing the company and how
to get out of this mess,

01:20:51.605 --> 01:20:53.345
and the other side of my mouth,

01:20:53.649 --> 01:20:57.233
deal with th ese guys that want
to just tear everything down.

01:20:57.527 --> 01:20:59.142
for me, I was conflicted.

01:20:59.446 --> 01:21:01.812
they don't understand
the product,

01:21:02.115 --> 01:21:05.198
they don't understand the people
that worked for the company,

01:21:05.494 --> 01:21:06.984
they don't understand
the systems,

01:21:07.287 --> 01:21:08.402
they don't understand anything.

01:21:08.705 --> 01:21:11.822
the seeds of failure
are built in to it.

01:21:12.125 --> 01:21:13.410
and it can't last.

01:21:13.710 --> 01:21:17.202
he basically fought
the restructuring officers--

01:21:17.506 --> 01:21:18.996
there were numerous
of them that came in.

01:21:19.299 --> 01:21:23.087
and I remember so vividly
going to the first meeting.

01:21:23.387 --> 01:21:26.254
i talked to them, and I say,
"well now, i'm on the board,

01:21:26.556 --> 01:21:28.387
"and i've still got
the officially

01:21:28.684 --> 01:21:30.265
"the chairman of the company.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:33.302
i mean, that's a chairman
without portfolio,"

01:21:33.605 --> 01:21:35.095
i said,
"what do you want me to do?

01:21:35.399 --> 01:21:36.855
"who's going to be
the visionary?

01:21:37.150 --> 01:21:39.391
"who's going to think about
what we should be doing

01:21:39.695 --> 01:21:41.105
in this industry
in the future?"

01:21:41.405 --> 01:21:44.147
and this idiot woman
says to me,

01:21:44.449 --> 01:21:45.689
"we don't need a visionary."

01:21:47.285 --> 01:21:49.276
i can't control
anything anymore.

01:21:49.579 --> 01:21:51.991
so what was I to do?
just shake my head and walk off.

01:21:52.290 --> 01:21:53.450
betsy had interviewed the group,

01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:57.038
and if I remember,
most of us individually

01:21:57.337 --> 01:22:00.420
who were in senior management,
so we knew what was going on.

01:22:00.716 --> 01:22:05.881
and mike solomon was
promoted to president,

01:22:06.179 --> 01:22:10.297
and he had to do what
th ese bank guys wanted to do,

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:12.431
and so everything just
kind of had stopped.

01:22:12.728 --> 01:22:14.264
somebody who was an outsider

01:22:14.563 --> 01:22:16.645
was taking it away from us.

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:19.397
i was caught
in the middle, really.

01:22:19.693 --> 01:22:21.183
we needed to be
profitable, basically,

01:22:21.486 --> 01:22:24.353
and we needed to pay our debt.
but to do that,

01:22:24.656 --> 01:22:27.819
we basically had to cut
the heart out of the company.

01:22:28.118 --> 01:22:32.737
[stan]in 2004, they got rid
of me and dee

01:22:33.039 --> 01:22:34.279
and mark viducich,

01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:36.323
i guess they decided,
i think then,

01:22:36.626 --> 01:22:37.365
to liquidate the company.

01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:38.784
they didn't say it,

01:22:39.087 --> 01:22:41.954
and it took 'em
a few years to do it,

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:43.713
but they were no longer

01:22:44.009 --> 01:22:45.624
interested in trying
to either grow the company

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:48.134
or save the company,
in my opinion.

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:51.513
they told us,
and instructed us

01:22:51.808 --> 01:22:55.596
what we had to do
to cut costs, save money,

01:22:55.896 --> 01:22:59.354
increase profits if we could,
or at least decrease losses,

01:22:59.649 --> 01:23:00.980
so if we can fire someone making

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:04.234
200,000, we can hire
someone making 100,000.

01:23:04.529 --> 01:23:05.644
i was in mike solomon's office

01:23:05.947 --> 01:23:10.190
with he and a lady
we call betty boop,

01:23:10.494 --> 01:23:11.825
and you know why you're there.

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.951
it's not a secret,
i told him and betty,

01:23:14.247 --> 01:23:16.329
"you guys are the ones
that shouldn't be here.

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:18.707
you guys are the people
that should be fired, not me."

01:23:19.002 --> 01:23:21.618
firing people that you
had hired 30 years ago.

01:23:21.922 --> 01:23:25.039
people that you know,
were started as clerks

01:23:25.342 --> 01:23:29.130
that were now regional managers
or vps or whatever.

01:23:29.429 --> 01:23:32.216
it's just, you know, awful.

01:23:32.516 --> 01:23:34.256
stanley and I were
up at lake tahoe.

01:23:34.559 --> 01:23:38.393
we're having a drink after
doing some gambling at the bar,

01:23:38.688 --> 01:23:42.806
and out of the blue,
he says, "oh bob, by the way,

01:23:43.109 --> 01:23:44.519
we're restructuring
the company."

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:46.151
"we need to structure
the company

01:23:46.446 --> 01:23:48.357
because of growth or whatever,"

01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:51.239
and I was just like, stunned.

01:23:51.535 --> 01:23:54.993
because, I mean,
this little private setting.

01:23:55.288 --> 01:23:58.405
so, I mean,
i was hammering down
some scotches at that point.

01:23:58.708 --> 01:24:00.323
the day heidi fired me,
you know,

01:24:00.627 --> 01:24:02.333
she called me in one day
and she says,

01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:04.244
"rudy, this is hard
for me to say,

01:24:04.548 --> 01:24:07.836
but I want a divorce."

01:24:08.134 --> 01:24:10.750
it was really hard,
and I knew it was hard for her

01:24:11.054 --> 01:24:14.262
as it was for me,
you know, and so,

01:24:14.558 --> 01:24:16.389
i went to russ, he said,
"now what the fuck

01:24:16.685 --> 01:24:18.346
are we going to do with you?"
like that.

01:24:18.645 --> 01:24:20.727
he never fired anybody
in his life.

01:24:21.022 --> 01:24:23.354
let alone his whole executive
committee for christ sakes.

01:24:23.650 --> 01:24:26.266
Â— it's not who he was.
- he took me out for lunch.

01:24:26.570 --> 01:24:27.810
actually called me and he said,
"want to go to lunch?"

01:24:28.113 --> 01:24:30.946
and I thought,
"this is not boding well.

01:24:31.241 --> 01:24:32.651
"russ doesn't call you
and ask you to lunch.

01:24:32.951 --> 01:24:34.737
this is not..." you know.
and he was in tears.

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:37.948
i mean, it was as hard
for him as it was for me.

01:24:38.248 --> 01:24:39.863
it was probably harder,
i felt worse for him.

01:24:40.166 --> 01:24:43.283
russ and I are cousins,
and mike solomon,

01:24:43.587 --> 01:24:47.500
who was also the ceo
at one time, and I are cousins,

01:24:47.799 --> 01:24:51.132
and to see family members
just thrown aside too

01:24:51.428 --> 01:24:56.092
was harder than just
losing a 30-year career.

01:24:56.391 --> 01:24:59.804
and at the end of 30 years,
i got a watch.

01:25:00.103 --> 01:25:03.015
just shortly after
i left the company.

01:25:03.315 --> 01:25:05.306
in fact, i'm wearing it
right now, today.

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:08.520
and it says,

01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:11.653
" bob, thank you, we love
you, Tower Records."

01:25:16.745 --> 01:25:18.576
and uh, it was mutual.

01:25:24.669 --> 01:25:27.285
[ken]! wish probably
that I could say there was more

01:25:27.589 --> 01:25:30.126
survivor's guilt, but, um,

01:25:31.635 --> 01:25:34.251
there was a lot of relief too.

01:25:34.554 --> 01:25:38.263
[interviewer]and then
as more layoffs happened...?

01:25:39.476 --> 01:25:40.807
no?

01:25:48.485 --> 01:25:51.101
[Mike Solomon] Cutting
the essential parts of Tower

01:25:51.404 --> 01:25:54.567
that made it so successful
was heart wrenching.

01:25:54.866 --> 01:25:56.072
that was the heart
of the company.

01:25:56.368 --> 01:25:57.904
i mean, the company
wasn't going to run

01:25:58.203 --> 01:26:00.694
without this team.

01:26:00.997 --> 01:26:02.988
and sure enough it didn't.

01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:05.373
[male reporter 1]tonight,
the founder of Tower Records

01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:07.830
is closing his last
retail record store.

01:26:08.129 --> 01:26:10.040
[female reporter]it's the end
of the line for an icon

01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:11.546
that put sacramento on the map.

01:26:11.841 --> 01:26:13.206
[male reporter 2]
one of several chains

01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:15.296
closing its doors nationwide.

01:26:15.595 --> 01:26:17.551
[melancholy piano music playing]

01:26:22.602 --> 01:26:24.888
[russ]! was in new york
at fourth and broadway,

01:26:25.188 --> 01:26:27.474
and we had an apartment
in the same building

01:26:27.774 --> 01:26:31.312
and I was staying there,
looking at the store

01:26:31.611 --> 01:26:33.147
when it closed that night.

01:26:33.446 --> 01:26:35.562
stood across the street
and watched, yeah.

01:26:37.325 --> 01:26:39.782
what are you going to do?
it's over.

01:26:40.078 --> 01:26:41.614
they all shut down at once,
and a bunch of people

01:26:41.913 --> 01:26:44.325
lost their job at the end.

01:26:44.624 --> 01:26:46.785
it was one of the greatest
tragedies of my life,

01:26:47.085 --> 01:26:48.450
to be honest with you,
when it closed down.

01:26:48.753 --> 01:26:50.960
it really, really upset me.

01:26:51.256 --> 01:26:53.747
and I missed it,
i missed that routine of going

01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:56.962
to buy my records
or my cds or whatever.

01:26:57.262 --> 01:26:59.423
[ken]it really was
this organization,

01:26:59.723 --> 01:27:03.557
this camaraderie, this group
that coalesced around russ

01:27:03.852 --> 01:27:05.808
and was able to feed off

01:27:06.104 --> 01:27:08.811
and build on russ' vision.

01:27:14.029 --> 01:27:17.692
in the early 70's,
i took a job at Tower Broadway

01:27:17.991 --> 01:27:19.902
here in sacramento,
at 16th and broadway,

01:27:20.201 --> 01:27:21.691
and in 1992,

01:27:21.995 --> 01:27:25.783
i actually ended up here
at watt avenue as the manager.

01:27:26.082 --> 01:27:27.572
we have a marquee out
on the front of our store

01:27:27.876 --> 01:27:30.037
that we just advertise
what's going on

01:27:30.336 --> 01:27:31.872
in the store
and what's happening.

01:27:32.172 --> 01:27:33.582
when we got the word

01:27:33.882 --> 01:27:35.964
that the liquidators
had won the auction

01:27:36.259 --> 01:27:38.545
and it was imminent that
it was going to be the end,

01:27:38.845 --> 01:27:40.801
we wanted to put something
up on the marquee.

01:27:41.097 --> 01:27:43.679
one of my employees,
dale, came up with:

01:27:43.975 --> 01:27:47.763
all things must pass.
thanks, sacramento.

01:27:48.063 --> 01:27:51.271
i went home, and the next
day I came in to work,

01:27:51.566 --> 01:27:52.851
they had taken a huge banner

01:27:53.151 --> 01:27:55.267
that was like 100-feet
long it seemed like,

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:57.185
that said basically going
out of business.

01:27:57.489 --> 01:27:59.195
and they put
that banner up across

01:27:59.491 --> 01:28:01.402
the whole top of the exterior
of the building,

01:28:01.701 --> 01:28:04.033
covered up our sign that said
"all things must pass",

01:28:04.329 --> 01:28:05.865
and you know,
it was pretty deflating.

01:28:06.164 --> 01:28:08.496
it was like, you know reality
slaps you right in the face.

01:28:08.792 --> 01:28:10.453
when they were finally gone,
they took down the sign,

01:28:10.752 --> 01:28:13.334
and exposed our message
one more time.

01:28:18.968 --> 01:28:20.174
it's really sad.

01:28:21.721 --> 01:28:23.677
the skeleton is still here.

01:28:23.973 --> 01:28:28.182
and the parts are still here,
even though they're not working.

01:28:32.357 --> 01:28:34.689
and it was filled with records.

01:28:34.984 --> 01:28:36.474
and the music was playing.

01:28:36.778 --> 01:28:39.690
and the people were running
around and shopping.

01:28:39.989 --> 01:28:42.822
but then again,
that's the past.

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:47.323
there's no way
you can change that.

01:28:47.622 --> 01:28:49.738
let's think about what
to do in the future.

01:28:51.835 --> 01:28:55.544
[upbeat orchestral
music playing]

01:29:06.891 --> 01:29:09.633
i sunrise doesn't last i

01:29:09.936 --> 01:29:12.427
i all morning... i

01:29:12.730 --> 01:29:16.393
[dave grohl]driving though
shibuya or shinjuku or herajuku

01:29:16.693 --> 01:29:19.730
or wherever it was,
and I see the Tower Records

01:29:20.029 --> 01:29:22.315
fucking logo on a building.

01:29:22.615 --> 01:29:23.855
i was like... [gasps]

01:29:24.159 --> 01:29:26.901
you guys have Tower Records?
hell, yeah.

01:29:31.416 --> 01:29:35.750
i it's not always
going to be... i

01:29:36.045 --> 01:29:38.001
[dave grohl]so we went in.

01:29:38.298 --> 01:29:40.129
it was fucking
Tower Records, man.

01:29:40.425 --> 01:29:43.542
every floor I went to,
there was another different cd,

01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:45.460
and there's displays everywhere,

01:29:45.763 --> 01:29:46.923
and there's people shopping
and buying music.

01:29:47.223 --> 01:29:48.463
listening on listening stations,

01:29:48.766 --> 01:29:50.882
and you know, it was amazing.

01:29:58.484 --> 01:30:00.349
[russ]to see japan flourish
like it does,

01:30:00.653 --> 01:30:03.315
i'm really proud of them.
i really am.

01:30:03.615 --> 01:30:05.230
i'm as happy as can be.

01:30:05.533 --> 01:30:07.524
because it just proves
that it can be done.

01:30:07.827 --> 01:30:11.160
'cause they're doing the same
thing we did all along.

01:30:17.837 --> 01:30:19.828
[woman]
Tower was Russ' baby.

01:30:20.131 --> 01:30:24.750
he built it, he nurtured it,
he expanded it.

01:30:25.053 --> 01:30:26.839
it's very special,
it's very unique.

01:30:28.723 --> 01:30:31.510
the feeling that
they all have for russ,

01:30:31.809 --> 01:30:33.470
for Tower, for each other.

01:30:33.770 --> 01:30:34.885
people went to music stores,

01:30:35.188 --> 01:30:37.099
they listened to music,
it was an experience

01:30:37.398 --> 01:30:38.979
going in to a store
and browsing

01:30:39.275 --> 01:30:41.607
through tens of thousands
of records.

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:44.189
it was here,
we were part of it,

01:30:44.489 --> 01:30:46.821
we all fell in love,
and then it went away.

01:30:47.116 --> 01:30:49.107
having a job doesn't
have to be tedious,

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:51.571
it doesn't have to be boring,
it doesn't have to be a place

01:30:51.871 --> 01:30:54.032
that you hate to go every day.

01:30:54.332 --> 01:30:58.041
it certainly wasn't for me,
and probably everybody
who worked at Tower.

01:30:58.336 --> 01:30:59.667
it was a family.

01:30:59.963 --> 01:31:02.750
and that family ideal stuck
with everybody

01:31:03.049 --> 01:31:04.255
up till the end.

01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:07.667
wasn't a job,
it was just a way of life.

I think Tower to me was

01:31:20.066 --> 01:31:22.398
a vision of one person

01:31:22.694 --> 01:31:25.106
who knew what they wanted
to give to the world,

01:31:25.405 --> 01:31:28.192
or offer to the world,
and us spending

01:31:28.491 --> 01:31:29.856
30 years both following

01:31:30.159 --> 01:31:32.320
and trying to refine
that vision.

01:31:34.122 --> 01:31:36.659
[russ]
we were part of people's lives

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:39.665
because music was part
of people's lives.

01:31:41.254 --> 01:31:44.838
i all things must pass i

01:31:48.428 --> 01:31:53.092
i all things
must pass away... i

01:32:05.611 --> 01:32:07.818
[russ]it was the music
that was meaningful

01:32:13.911 --> 01:32:15.117
and we were how they got it.

01:32:19.459 --> 01:32:21.040
what's the matter?
did you run out of questions?

01:32:21.336 --> 01:32:23.042
