01:08.560 --> 01:10.800
The woman treated me like shit.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.800

01:52.640 --> 01:54.440
The brother I never had.

01:54.960 --> 01:57.040
He would do anything for me
and I for him.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.240
My brother...

02:00.440 --> 02:03.240
It is always gentle and kind.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.759
It is a model for me.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.440

07:05.440 --> 07:07.360
I have no answer to the TAF.

We lent our boat.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.200
Your father has a boat?

"His case" ?

10:09.800 --> 10:10.760

10:10.920 --> 10:11.920
They believe the weak.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.160

10:20.120 --> 10:22.040
I do not care, I'm going with Liam.

10:22.640 --> 10:23.840
Not get excited.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.000
Do not worry, honey, I'm here.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.400
OK, handsome.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.880
You're kids.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.480
I do not need you.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.320
I'll find me a real man.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.840
Who will want to kiss you?

10:40.440 --> 10:41.680
Fuck you put!

10:43.400 --> 10:44.320
Pass the bottle.

Bute me, bitch!

12:32.720 --> 12:34.320
Leave him alone !

12:34.480 --> 12:36.680
If you touch him again, I'll kill you!

12:56.080 --> 12:58.520
I was placed directly
in foster care.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.200
My future, I think so too.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.880
I never leave this shitty island.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.720
I'll end with a guy who hit me.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.440
I will have obese children.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.680
I laugh.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.400
I do not want to dream too much.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.360
Money,

the clothes, the prince ...

13:22.680 --> 13:24.360

13:28.200 --> 13:31.080
Master Chef is ready soon?
I have more grass.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.280
Calmos, I apply myself.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.080
Pay.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.360
I do not chow that.

Dinner ...

13:39.880 --> 13:40.760
is served.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.320
T'abuses!

14:13.320 --> 14:14.600
They will kill us.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.120
You'll see.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.400
Stop, it is already quite broken.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.360
Take care of your ass.

14:32.160 --> 14:33.240
May, just kidding.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.360
Do not get mad.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.120
Leave her, she has her period.

14:39.240 --> 14:39.840
What?

14:42.280 --> 14:43.000
Say again !

14:46.080 --> 14:47.440

- Nothing.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.560
If, as you said something.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.040
- But no.
- Yes.

14:51.440 --> 14:52.600
Where did you get that?

14:52.760 --> 14:55.040
- Anton farted our laptops.
- The bastard!

14:55.360 --> 14:56.560
It's fucked up.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.040
- I'll fix it.
- He is dead.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.800
Who cares, portable.
What do we do there?

15:01.960 --> 15:04.160
- You got the keys to the supermarket?
- Forget it.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.320
Come on!

15:05.760 --> 15:07.920
It's your birthday
and there will be nobody down there.

15:08.320 --> 15:11.040
There's more to eat or booze,
let's go.

15:12.960 --> 15:13.960
Come on!

15:15.840 --> 15:16.960

15:17.120 --> 15:18.080
Come.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.640
I am sorry.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.840
I do not feel good.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.240
It's disgusting !

15:27.880 --> 15:28.920
Pork !

15:29.600 --> 15:32.040
We shoot,
Thomas will repaint the floor.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.280
You come with us ?

15:36.600 --> 15:39.360

it remains both there.

15:41.160 --> 15:42.440
What are you looking for ?

15:42.600 --> 15:44.160
Nothing at all.

15:52.120 --> 15:55.040
You are crazy,
we have no right to get out of here.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.320
Shut up !

15:56.640 --> 15:59.880
They leave us alone,
they do not care, our mouths.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.920
- Ç feared.
- You speak !

16:14.080 --> 16:16.200
I'm not supposed to have the key.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.920
Do not worry, they will not.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.480
Taking beers,
All the food and we are shooting.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.200

You make shit!

16:50.440 --> 16:52.960
We go to the supermarket.
He will tell us what?

16:53.120 --> 16:56.120
He drank and fucked her car
instead of watching us.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.160
Wait for me, Liam.

17:21.800 --> 17:22.680
Let's go.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.160
Give me the keys.

17:25.760 --> 17:26.599

17:34.920 --> 17:36.960
Go ahead, I do not need you.

She's right, it sucks.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.800

17:39.960 --> 17:41.880
We did not come for nothing.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.360
Wait for us here, May.

17:44.520 --> 17:46.600

Bastian, you come?

17:51.760 --> 17:52.480

18:33.680 --> 18:34.520
Come.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.680

19:37.840 --> 19:39.800
You think he prefers you to me?

19:39.960 --> 19:41.200

20:26.440 --> 20:27.560
Shut up !

20:30.280 --> 20:31.240
What's the matter ?

20:31.960 --> 20:33.760
Emergency situation.

Stay home.

20:36.040 --> 20:37.880

You're gonna do what?

21:40.440 --> 21:41.480

21:41.640 --> 21:43.920

22:05.760 --> 22:06.600

22:11.840 --> 22:12.600

22:21.080 --> 22:22.600
It's me, bro.

22:23.040 --> 22:26.000

23:12.800 --> 23:13.560
No.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.200
Someone will take care of your mom.

23:16.680 --> 23:18.040
They are all wicked.

23:19.080 --> 23:19.920

Everything is fine ?

24:34.440 --> 24:35.800
- You like that?

24:35.960 --> 24:37.640
Come, we are shooting.

24:37.800 --> 24:38.800
Ham or chicken?

24:38.960 --> 24:40.640
Fuck. Let's go !

May!

25:53.480 --> 25:54.600
What do you have ?

25:55.160 --> 25:57.480
Anton went crazy,
he hit me.

25:57.960 --> 25:58.800
Stop!

25:58.960 --> 26:00.280
Stop the car!

26:05.480 --> 26:06.960
- Get in!
- What is this mess ?

26:08.600 --> 26:10.200
Go behind crawling!

26:11.560 --> 26:12.320
Monte!

26:13.880 --> 26:15.440

26:15.600 --> 26:17.600

26:17.760 --> 26:19.680

26:39.040 --> 26:39.960
What is happening ?

26:48.680 --> 26:49.720
I am in pain.

26:50.680 --> 26:51.800
It's horrible !

26:52.880 --> 26:54.120
She's bleeding a lot!

26:54.280 --> 26:55.200
Brothel!

26:55.360 --> 26:57.240
- Should help.
- We can do nothing !

26:57.600 --> 26:58.600
Hold on, May.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.520
I'm in port
ferries return to dock.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.360
The passengers panicked.

27:25.520 --> 27:29.120
We learn now
that access to the island of Northlands

27:29.280 --> 27:31.000
is prohibited for the moment.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.920
No start and no finish
is allowed.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.240
Serious incidents were reported.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.680
We are waiting
new information.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.040
Communications ...

27:40.200 --> 27:43.160
"Incidents", my ass!
They wanted to kill us.

27:47.080 --> 27:48.360
We're all going to die.

27:55.520 --> 27:56.720
What's your name ?

27:56.880 --> 27:57.720
Harry.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.640
What happened ?

28:02.320 --> 28:05.080
My father killed my sister like that.

28:20.600 --> 28:21.480
Look.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.400
Not stop you, Liam.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.360
Shit !

28:35.800 --> 28:37.160
The bastard!

28:38.560 --> 28:39.720
May, okay?

28:43.240 --> 28:44.640
Now what the fuck?

28:49.000 --> 28:49.840
He comes !

29:02.360 --> 29:03.240

Give me the gun.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.400
Tire, damn!

29:13.920 --> 29:14.880
Give it to me.

29:21.880 --> 29:22.720
Him !

29:23.040 --> 29:24.480
It is like them!

29:26.960 --> 29:28.360
Shut your mouth.

29:29.640 --> 29:30.360
I'm not like them.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.160
I have nothing, I tell you.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.480
Why he said that to you?

29:52.640 --> 29:54.280
You gonna shoot me?

29:58.560 --> 29:59.760
Kiss my ass !

30:00.320 --> 30:02.400
Help her get up and breaks.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.920
Pearl, help me.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.360
Must draw from this island of freaks.

30:20.840 --> 30:23.640
We'll find a safe place, May,
it will be fine.

30:25.680 --> 30:26.720
Do not worry.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.560
And if there are people in it?

30:41.720 --> 30:42.760
Like the others ?

30:42.920 --> 30:43.960
It is armed.

31:16.480 --> 31:17.280
Come.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.680
There's nobody.

31:37.240 --> 31:38.040
Liam ...

31:38.880 --> 31:39.920
Sorry.

31:45.040 --> 31:45.880
What's this ?

31:46.360 --> 31:47.640
To disinfect.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.000
Brings water.

31:58.400 --> 31:59.520
Ç feared!

32:09.320 --> 32:10.360
More is needed.

32:10.520 --> 32:12.120
She still bleeding.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.000
Wood.

32:28.720 --> 32:29.840
Ç was going to go.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.040
Why are you looking at me?

32:41.880 --> 32:44.680
You think that your mouth, huh?

32:46.520 --> 32:47.560

34:04.040 --> 34:04.960

34:12.400 --> 34:13.239
Shawn ...

34:24.199 --> 34:24.880
Given.

34:25.040 --> 34:28.000
"Mathilda, I hope
you never read this letter

34:28.159 --> 34:29.840
"And that you have been running away.

34:30.280 --> 34:31.600
"The adults went crazy.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.239
"They are killing children.

34:33.920 --> 34:37.120
"I'm afraid of becoming like them
and hurt you.

34:37.280 --> 34:38.880
"Do not ever trust anyone

34:39.040 --> 34:40.960
"Not even those you love.

34:41.639 --> 34:43.560
"Forgive me, forgive us.

34:44.239 --> 34:45.199
"Dad."

34:45.360 --> 34:46.719
They are all like that.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.360
And Shawn?

34:48.639 --> 34:49.840
He is doing very well.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.560
Dad ?

35:03.360 --> 35:06.680
Mom not feeling well,
She has a fever.

35:07.560 --> 35:08.760
I'll call you back.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.120
Dad, where are you?

35:11.600 --> 35:13.320
Mom worries me.

35:14.080 --> 35:16.680
She talks more, it trembles.

35:17.480 --> 35:18.360
You're here ?

35:20.440 --> 35:22.120
I am very scared!

35:22.320 --> 35:25.120
I have to stop,
Mom bleeding ears.

35:25.440 --> 35:29.040
A man threw himself on the windshield,
he wanted to attack us.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.040
Dad ?

35:31.920 --> 35:34.160
I saw a dead body beside the road.

35:34.320 --> 35:35.880
What is happening ?

35:36.040 --> 35:37.320
Mathilda?

35:37.960 --> 35:40.000
É listen to me, my darling, I love you.

35:40.160 --> 35:41.840
You're gonna do what I say.

Especially, not stop.

35:44.960 --> 35:46.000
É listen to me!

35:46.840 --> 35:48.640
Turn around immediately.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.760
Take the next ferry,

35:51.920 --> 35:54.360
leave the island as soon as possible!

35:55.600 --> 35:56.720
It's not true !

36:09.640 --> 36:10.840
Must get out of here.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.280
How crafty?

36:12.440 --> 36:13.400
Whatever.

36:13.560 --> 36:14.840
À foot, if necessary.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.240
As soon as it is light.

36:16.400 --> 36:17.240
We will go where?

36:17.520 --> 36:18.680
On the continent.

36:18.840 --> 36:21.000
How?
There's no more ferries.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.880
Your father was not a boat?

36:24.480 --> 36:25.240
Yes.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.040
So what ?

36:29.120 --> 36:31.520
Forget it.
Your father must be contaminated.

36:31.680 --> 36:32.680
Whatever !

36:33.680 --> 36:35.160
He is not stupid.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.080
He said nothing happened.

36:37.240 --> 36:38.200
He's waiting for me.

36:38.560 --> 36:39.560
Just me.

36:39.720 --> 36:40.720
And May?

36:43.280 --> 36:44.520
Every man for himself.

36:46.600 --> 36:47.920
You have someone good.

36:51.720 --> 36:52.480
No one.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.080
How are you feeling ?

37:16.200 --> 37:17.880
Great birthday!

37:19.280 --> 37:20.880

38:34.160 --> 38:35.160
If you want.

38:37.240 --> 38:38.920
I did not know you played.

38:39.320 --> 38:40.240
Not really.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.880
When we were little,

38:50.760 --> 38:52.680
my sister wanted to play the piano.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.160
But there was no piano.

38:56.720 --> 38:57.920
Where is she ?

39:05.360 --> 39:08.160
That is true
you have the pianist's hands.

39:09.720 --> 39:11.280
Have you ever seen a pianist?

39:11.440 --> 39:13.320
No, but I saw the hands.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.040
Do not do that.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.320
You do not like me ?

39:26.120 --> 39:27.120
Why ?

39:27.640 --> 39:29.880
- For several reasons.
- Which?

39:30.680 --> 39:31.600
Y plenty.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.040
I understood, I'm not dumb.

39:36.840 --> 39:37.680
Sorry.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.680
You believe me, do you?

41:12.280 --> 41:13.760
Do you believe me ?

41:35.040 --> 41:36.120
Do not worry.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.680

Come down from the car.

44:38.520 --> 44:39.360

She is beautiful, my girl, right?

46:56.280 --> 46:58.800
Shawn, we wanted to draw
this rotten island.

46:59.360 --> 47:01.240

Maybe we.

47:03.640 --> 47:05.440
Shawn Why not us?

47:09.240 --> 47:11.840
We may be sick

47:13.160 --> 47:14.560
There would symptoms.

47:14.720 --> 47:16.320
As Shawn?

47:16.840 --> 47:17.960
Ç has to see.

47:20.200 --> 47:22.680
May and Shawn loved me
and I did not care.

47:25.080 --> 47:26.400
Same for my father.

47:28.720 --> 47:30.200
I'm all screwed up.

47:31.280 --> 47:32.320
Do not worry,

47:33.120 --> 47:34.120
one will find it.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.680
I lost long ago.

48:02.840 --> 48:03.680
Shit !

48:06.480 --> 48:07.280
Pearl!

48:07.440 --> 48:08.360
Come quickly !

48:12.640 --> 48:13.520
Get in!

48:13.920 --> 48:15.280
Started !

48:19.600 --> 48:20.320
Quick !

48:28.880 --> 48:29.880
It's not true !

48:34.320 --> 48:35.560
Ç was going to go.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.280
Take the address.

48:40.680 --> 48:41.600
Go for it.

49:14.920 --> 49:17.880
"The judge said you're better at home
with me.

49:18.640 --> 49:21.880
"I retype the boat
if you would come back.

49:23.680 --> 49:24.600
"I love you.

49:26.280 --> 49:27.040
"Dad."

50:28.640 --> 50:30.200
I would like to sleep.

52:10.120 --> 52:10.960
Try this.

52:11.120 --> 52:12.720
No, it's disgusting.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.440
It's not easy but ...

52:15.280 --> 52:16.800
it has a little something.

52:21.000 --> 52:21.960
She's hot.

52:23.160 --> 52:23.960
Okay.

52:48.440 --> 52:49.320
Ç has suits you.

53:00.120 --> 53:01.560
Why did you do that?

53:08.280 --> 53:09.360
I dunno.

53:09.640 --> 53:11.080
I did, that's all.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.200
And now...

53:14.760 --> 53:16.320
you still want to die?

53:17.000 --> 53:17.960
Now...

53:20.000 --> 53:21.440
I want to be with you.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.640
You make me walk ?

53:28.360 --> 53:29.680
We could stay here.

53:33.600 --> 53:35.120
Ç said you really?

53:37.400 --> 53:38.960
Yes, it says.

53:45.360 --> 53:47.080
And if I like them?

53:47.720 --> 53:49.480
If I have something inside?

53:49.640 --> 53:51.560
Stop it, you have nothing.

53:52.920 --> 53:54.520
We are not adults.

53:55.840 --> 53:57.640
What is an adult?

53:58.520 --> 54:00.360
Shawn was younger than you.

54:01.280 --> 54:03.200
It is not a question of age.

54:03.960 --> 54:05.800
That's what you went through.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.600
So I'm an adult.

54:10.160 --> 54:12.880
I always had everything
before the other girls.

54:13.040 --> 54:15.000
Acne, my rules ...

54:17.440 --> 54:19.480
Ç has bothers you, what I say?

54:24.160 --> 54:26.200
Why are you like this with me?

54:26.480 --> 54:27.720
How am I ?

54:28.520 --> 54:29.680
Nice.

54:32.480 --> 54:34.760
I did not think I was interested to you.

54:38.120 --> 54:39.840
I thought you liked Liam.

54:43.480 --> 54:45.080
I was jealous of May.

54:45.240 --> 54:46.880
I wanted to be normal.

54:47.040 --> 54:49.160
As a girl who has relatives.

54:50.160 --> 54:51.640
You have me, now.

54:57.720 --> 54:59.600
I have no choice.

56:14.640 --> 56:15.840
I killed my sister.

56:22.960 --> 56:24.040
Its my fault.

56:24.520 --> 56:25.440
Its my fault !

56:35.480 --> 56:36.960
It's not your fault.

56:39.640 --> 56:40.800
It's over, all that.

56:53.440 --> 56:54.400
I love you.

58:44.320 --> 58:45.520
Bastian!

58:47.720 --> 58:48.720
What?

58:49.640 --> 58:50.680
Come.

58:59.440 --> 59:00.960
Hurry up !

59:05.880 --> 59:07.440
You not press, especially!

59:17.200 --> 59:18.440
What's the matter ?

59:20.200 --> 59:21.200
Come see.

59:21.440 --> 59:22.280
What?

59:23.680 --> 59:24.760
It is a surprise.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.840
Come.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.880
Come on, yes?

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.480
It is not cold.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.480
Stopped !

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.520
Come !

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.840
What are you doing here ?

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.480
We try to eat.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.000
Clear.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.480
Get out, I said!

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:13.840
What are you doing ?

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.440
Take her.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.440
Come back!

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.200
Not leave here!

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.480
Come back!

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.440
We can not take care of her.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.000
You are like the others.
You can not leave here.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.480
You will die!

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.360
We return.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.080
She was hungry.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.640
We can not take him.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.880
Take him where?

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.760
It remains here?

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.000
No more now.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.520
So she comes with us.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:46.720
Die!

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.720
Die, motherfucker!

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.760
Over there !

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.120
There's one other!

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.680
It is!

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.640
Kill him !

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.840
Kill him, damn!

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.000
Drawn !

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.200
There's no boat.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.399
It was that lying.

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.200
He said he lived in a villa.

01:09:15.479 --> 01:09:17.399
It was in his head, all that.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.720
Ç was going to go.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.240
I'm here.

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.600
Do not worry.

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.000
Stay here.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:40.880
His father...

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.000
He could not lie.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:49.400
It not lying.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.400
We'll find him, that boat.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.160
Quick !

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.720
Get in the boat.

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.360
We'll push it.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.280
Monte!

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:09.000
Started !

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.080
Hurry up !

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:11.280
No, up!

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.120
Pars!

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.000
Ç was okay, Pearl.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.840
Bastian, not!

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.880
I was not gifts.

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.520
All I have,
I managed to get it.

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:27.800
But...

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.360
it will change.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.000
Everything changes.

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.920
I would like to live in the jungle,

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.600
have a tree house,
near a river,

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:41.400
but it never happens to me nothing cool.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.680
We have two children.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.960
A boy and a girl.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.160
Ben and Jessica.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.600
No, wait ...

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:55.360
Two boys, Ben and Mark.

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.800
I'm still young,
the perfect woman and all that,

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.520
I know, it's something ...

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:06.080
If it takes me as I am,

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:07.800
so...

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.400
it's okay with me.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.960
My future ?

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.120
I can not see.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
As in fairy tales,

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.320
it happens like magic.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.920
Without really knowing ...

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.960
we are attracted to each other.

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.120
That's all.

01:14:38.305 --> 01:14:44.642
