"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.133 --> 00:36.200
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.233 --> 00:38.767
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.800 --> 00:41.733
in a court of law.

00:41.767 --> 00:44.367
-Dispatcher:
The reporting father
is on location.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.800
He's armed with a gun
pointed at the husband,
at the suspect.

00:46.833 --> 00:49.733
Deputy Park:
-54, I'm turning into
the neighborhood now.

00:49.767 --> 00:54.467
-It's a weapons disturbance.
A female said her husband's
got a knife

00:54.500 --> 00:58.000
and he's kicked in the door,
he's trying to get
into the house.

00:58.033 --> 01:00.267
(on radio)
-Is anybody out there yet?

01:00.300 --> 01:03.067
-Right-hand side.

01:03.067 --> 01:05.500
-(radio chatter)

01:05.533 --> 01:10.067
-Put down the gun!
Put down the gun!

01:10.100 --> 01:12.500
Where's the guy at?

01:12.533 --> 01:15.100
Back up. Where's he at?

01:15.133 --> 01:17.967
-Now, can you see about this?
-Where's the knife?

01:18.067 --> 01:19.300
-I don't know
where the knife is.

01:19.333 --> 01:21.933
-I have no knife.
-Josh, get down,
lay down on the floor.

01:21.967 --> 01:24.333
-Oh, I can't do that.
-Why?

01:24.367 --> 01:26.500
-I ain't gonna
lay on the ground, dude.

01:26.533 --> 01:30.133
I-I-I don't have anything,
I'll stand up.
-Don't stand up.

01:30.167 --> 01:31.700
You heard what I said.

01:31.733 --> 01:34.367
-Well, you're with it,
I don't have a knife.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.500
I don't have anything.
My hands are in the air.

01:36.533 --> 01:38.900
I will not get on
the (bleep) ground, dude.

01:38.933 --> 01:41.967
-You're gonna
have to get on the ground.
-For what?

01:42.067 --> 01:43.500
-That's what I'm telling you
to do.

01:43.533 --> 01:46.567
-But what I'm telling you is,
I'm not gonna get on the ground

01:46.600 --> 01:48.267
because I don't have anything
in my hands.

01:48.300 --> 01:53.067
I don't have anything
in my pants. I have no (bleep)
knife, no bomb, noth--

01:53.100 --> 01:54.100
I have nothin'.

01:54.133 --> 01:55.633
-Why am I here?
-Why are you here?

01:55.667 --> 01:57.433
Probably 'cause I threatened
my wife.

01:57.467 --> 01:59.767
-Okay, now, get down
on the ground like I told you.
-No, no, no,

01:59.800 --> 02:03.367
-no, no, like I said... don't...
push me, dude.

02:03.400 --> 02:08.133
I'm not gettin' on the ground.

02:08.167 --> 02:11.500
Dude, you can beat
the (bleep)... take my hat off.

02:11.533 --> 02:14.933
-Josh, please stop!
-I'm not gettin'
on the goddamn ground.

02:14.967 --> 02:19.200
-Handcuff that arm.
-Oh my god. Oh my god,
you pussy.

02:19.233 --> 02:23.700
Here... big mama, take my hand.
You kicked me in the chest.

02:23.733 --> 02:27.800
Take my left hand, put it
by my right,

02:27.833 --> 02:30.900
(indistinct)

02:30.933 --> 02:34.167
There we go, baby.
There we go.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.733
There we go.
-Take him to your car.

02:37.767 --> 02:41.433
Now you gotta stand up, dude.
-Y'all good to do my--
y'all good to do--

02:41.467 --> 02:43.700
-Ready?

02:43.733 --> 02:48.233
-Hey, hey... I ain't no (bleep),
at least put my goddamn shoes
on, police.

02:48.267 --> 02:52.767
-We'll get your shoes.
-No, no, (bleep) no.
(indistinct) No!

02:52.800 --> 02:57.167
No! No!
At least you put
my goddamn shoes on!

02:57.200 --> 03:00.200
No!
-(radio chatter)

03:00.233 --> 03:02.067
-Is this your car?

03:02.067 --> 03:06.933
-Bite me. I'm lickin'
your bitch ass. 'Cause
you like me.

03:06.967 --> 03:08.067
-Get in the car, dude.

03:08.067 --> 03:10.900
Mother (bleep).
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:10.933 --> 03:14.633
-Get in the car.
-Hey now, look at me,
look at me, look at me

03:14.667 --> 03:16.367
in the (bleep) eyes.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.567
-Get in the car.
-Hey! Hey!

03:18.600 --> 03:20.067
-Get in the car, dude.
-No.

03:20.067 --> 03:23.700
Hey. Well, I like that, don't I.
-Push him in.

03:23.733 --> 03:27.067
-(laughs)

03:27.067 --> 03:30.667
-Everybody okay?
-Yeah. When I got here,
I could see him

03:30.700 --> 03:34.433
moving in the house.
I went in the back door,
and Dad's pointing a gun at him.

03:34.467 --> 03:36.633
He's sittin' on the sofa,
right in the livin' room.

03:36.667 --> 03:39.067
-(bang from inside car)
-Hey, go a little harder, bitch.
-(bang)

03:39.100 --> 03:41.133
-You get a hobble?
-Come on, fool.

03:41.167 --> 03:43.633
-(bang)
-Hey, get the hobble.

03:43.667 --> 03:47.133
-Oh my god. Hey, get the hobble.
Get the hobble.

03:47.167 --> 03:49.600
There you go.
-Chill out. Chill out.

03:49.633 --> 03:54.400
-I'm not gonna kick you, buddy.
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
(laughs)

03:54.433 --> 03:57.833
Oh, he can't get it.
He can't get it, look,
he's stressin'.

03:57.867 --> 04:04.233
Look at his face.
Look at him. Now you got him.
Now you got me.

04:04.267 --> 04:08.733
Oh, yeah, you got me, bitch.
-Let's go see if we can find
the knife.

04:12.867 --> 04:17.367
Dad's gun.
This is your husband?
Y'all are married?

04:17.400 --> 04:19.067
-Yes.
-And these kids are okay?

04:19.067 --> 04:20.567
-Yeah.
-Scared.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.200
-Where's his knife?
-One was a butcher knife,
and then one was like

04:23.233 --> 04:26.600
a breadcutter, I think.
And he got 'em
from right up here

04:26.633 --> 04:28.933
and they're missing,
so... he must've tossed it.

04:28.967 --> 04:30.967
-Come have a seat over here
in the livin' room.

04:31.067 --> 04:32.700
So what set this off tonight?

04:32.733 --> 04:37.433
-He has been drinking a lot.
-Today, or every day?

04:37.467 --> 04:41.100
-Lately, I mean, and then
he'll stop for a few days
and he'll get real bad.

04:41.133 --> 04:45.067
And he has-- if you saw
the scar on his head,
he has mental problems,

04:45.067 --> 04:49.433
like his brain
cannot take alcohol.
And he gets very... crazy.

04:49.467 --> 04:53.633
So, this morning he had to go
to probation downtown
for his DWI.

04:53.667 --> 04:57.367
On his way back, I knew
he'd been drinking.
And with the tone on him,

04:57.400 --> 05:00.733
I'm like, hey, what are you
doin', and he goes
"Stop (bleep) askin' me

05:00.767 --> 05:02.300
where I am, you stupid bitch."

05:02.333 --> 05:04.133
Okay.
-And that was before
he came home?

05:04.167 --> 05:06.600
-Yeah, that's before
he came home.
Then he got home,

05:06.633 --> 05:11.267
and acting crazy like
right when we pulled in there,
he slapped me on the side

05:11.300 --> 05:14.767
and then he threw my phone
at me. And he goes,
"Turn around, Megan,"

05:14.800 --> 05:16.733
and I said no,
'cause he had the knife out,

05:16.767 --> 05:18.800
and then
that's when I slammed the door
on him and I locked it,

05:18.833 --> 05:20.633
and I ran to my father's room.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.833
-Y'all locked him
out of the house?
-Yeah.

05:22.867 --> 05:24.267
-I guess
he kicked the door open,
didn't he?

05:24.300 --> 05:26.067
-He kicked the door open
-And, uh...

05:26.067 --> 05:28.733
-He wented my dad
to shoot him.

05:28.767 --> 05:31.900
-He didn't charge me
or anything, but he came in

05:31.933 --> 05:34.567
and I grabbed the-- you know,
I had the gun.
-You have to defend yourself.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.600
Everything is based on
his actions. I think,
under the circumstances,

05:37.633 --> 05:39.467
this ended as well
as it could have.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.200
I'm glad nobody had to get shot.

05:42.600 --> 05:46.200
-At any point did you
use any weapons?
-No.

05:46.233 --> 05:47.733
-Knives?
-I don't have any weapons.

05:47.767 --> 05:51.467
-Knives? Any knives?
Did you use any knives
against your family?

05:51.500 --> 05:53.333
Try to intimidate 'em,
threaten 'em?

05:53.367 --> 05:56.267
-Probably a threat,
but I have no damn knives
on me.

05:56.300 --> 06:00.200
I don't have anything
in my shirt or nothin'.
-Nothin' in your shirt?

06:00.233 --> 06:03.633
-No, I mean nothin' on me, no.
-I haven't looked in the truck.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.533
-All right, thank you, man.

06:05.567 --> 06:09.467
-Which truck is his?
The one in the driveway?

06:09.500 --> 06:13.200
Oh, yeah. So, when he came out,
he probably walked around here

06:13.233 --> 06:15.767
and threw 'em in the back
of the truck. He's not
that crazy.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.767
-He knows what's goin' on.
-They matched the ones
that are in the house.

06:18.800 --> 06:22.500
She said one looked like
a bread knife, and the other
was like a longer knife.

06:22.533 --> 06:25.167
-Well, that's the one.
-Just like she described.

06:25.200 --> 06:29.067
All right, so, Dad?
You were at a point
where you almost had to shoot

06:29.067 --> 06:31.667
your son-in-law,
which is a terrible position
for you to be in.

06:31.700 --> 06:35.667
And what we've seen in cases
like this is it progressively
gets worse.

06:35.700 --> 06:39.067
We're to the point now,
we're filing aggravated assault
charges. That's a felony.

06:39.100 --> 06:40.933
He knows what he's doing.
Make sure that she understands

06:40.967 --> 06:43.200
she shouldn't feel guilty
about this.

06:46.833 --> 06:49.367
Senior Deputy Gardner:
-I do, I work out most days,
three or four days a week,

06:49.400 --> 06:52.100
and I found that being
in good physical condition,

06:52.133 --> 06:53.900
you don't have to fight people
as much.

06:53.933 --> 06:56.067
You don't have to deal with
as much stress,

06:56.100 --> 06:59.500
because people see that you can
take care of yourself,

06:59.533 --> 07:03.100
and it makes the job easier.

07:03.133 --> 07:07.167
This area's a high drug area.
A lot of crime.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.933
People sit out in their cars
and do drugs out here.

07:09.967 --> 07:13.100
It looks like we've got two
in this silver Passat
right here.

07:13.133 --> 07:16.167
Let's get out and see
what's going on with them.

07:21.700 --> 07:24.867
Sheriff's Office, what are--
uh-uh... no, no...
what are y'all doing

07:24.900 --> 07:26.067
in the back of the car
right here?

07:26.067 --> 07:28.867
I know who-- I know you.
-We're just talking.

07:28.900 --> 07:31.400
-What are you talking about?
-I'm havin' a fight
with my boyfriend.

07:31.433 --> 07:35.400
-Let me have that... drink?
Just let me move it out
of the way.

07:35.433 --> 07:39.900
Step out here for me, please.
You don't have any weapons
or anything on you, do you?

07:39.933 --> 07:41.900
How are you doing, man.
Step over here.
-Good.

07:41.933 --> 07:45.300
-Step to the back
of the vehicle. And just wait
right there for me, okay?

07:45.333 --> 07:47.333
What's your name, man?
-Donald.

07:47.367 --> 07:50.167
-Huh? You got some ID on you,
brother?
-Yes, sir.

07:50.200 --> 07:55.267
-Huh? Let me see it.
I know this girl right here.
What are you doing

07:55.300 --> 07:56.600
in the back of the car
with her?

07:56.633 --> 07:59.433
-Uh... just chillin'.
I come to talk to her--
-Yeah.

07:59.467 --> 08:02.933
Step out of the vehicle, man.

08:06.667 --> 08:11.500
Come on, brother.
Just put your hands on top
and let me make sure

08:11.533 --> 08:16.400
you got no weapons
on you, okay?
-Yes, sir.

08:16.433 --> 08:19.400
-Why is that a syringe
laying there on the thing, man?

08:19.433 --> 08:22.433
-I'm not sure. This isn't
my vehicle.
-Nathan is my ex-husband.

08:22.467 --> 08:25.067
He takes a lot of different
medications, so
you could talk to him

08:25.100 --> 08:28.533
about that.
-What's the deal? Why is there
a syringe sittin' there?

08:28.567 --> 08:32.433
-Man, my wife cheated on me,
I'm going through--
I got two kids...

08:32.467 --> 08:34.833
-I'm not asking you about her,
I'm asking you why
there is a syringe

08:34.867 --> 08:38.067
right there
where you're sittin'.
Listen, I know what's up.

08:38.067 --> 08:40.733
-I have no clue.
-Okay, so you don't know
why there's a syringe

08:40.767 --> 08:43.867
sittin' right in front of you
on the seat.
-Her husband's a diabetic

08:43.900 --> 08:46.767
as far as I'm--
It's not my vehicle, sir.
I just...

08:46.800 --> 08:49.600
literally
just got in the vehicle.
-Right.

08:49.633 --> 08:53.800
Listen, I'm just looking
for a little common sense
here, okay?

08:53.833 --> 08:55.933
Let's go through it again,
what's your name, first?
-Donald.

08:55.967 --> 09:00.533
-Donald what?
Donald what?

09:00.567 --> 09:03.067
-Donald.
-Donald what?

09:03.100 --> 09:07.167
Here you go, man, just until
we figure out who you are,
just put your hands up here.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.933
What we're gonna do is,
we're gonna hook you up
with some handcuffs

09:09.967 --> 09:11.433
until I can figure out
just who you are.

09:11.467 --> 09:14.700
-I have the right
to an attorney.
-You sure do.

09:14.733 --> 09:17.500
Keep an eye on her, make sure
she didn't get rid of nothin'.

09:17.533 --> 09:19.200
All right, let's check you
again, man.

09:19.233 --> 09:21.067
You got anything
that's gonna stick me?
-No, sir.

09:21.067 --> 09:24.167
-Nothing's gonna hurt me, right?
-No.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.800
-Oh, there you are.
That's your ID right there.

09:27.833 --> 09:32.067
-Yeah, but, how can you
go through my stuff whenever
I haven't done anything.

09:32.067 --> 09:34.800
-Just hang tight.
-That's against the law, sir.

09:34.833 --> 09:37.067
-That's fine
if you believe that.

09:37.067 --> 09:40.900
-Yeah, but I didn't
do anything.
-You got a syringe

09:40.933 --> 09:43.067
sittin' right in front of you.
-That's not my vehicle, sir.

09:43.067 --> 09:45.100
-It's sittin'
right in front of you
in the back seat of the car.

09:45.133 --> 09:47.333
-I just stepped in the car, sir,
you can--
-Let's go and have a seat

09:47.367 --> 09:49.433
over here until we figure out
what's goin' on, okay?
-Yes, sir.

09:49.467 --> 09:52.333
-What's in the syringe?
-I have no clue, sir.

09:52.367 --> 09:54.133
-Well, why's it right in front
of you on the seat?

09:54.167 --> 09:56.100
And why were you refusing
to give me your name?
Have a seat.

09:56.133 --> 09:58.767
-Yeah.
-Be right with you, bro.
Go and have a seat.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.400
Is there anything I'm gonna
find in the car, ma'am,
is there any drugs in here?

10:01.433 --> 10:03.900
If there is, just tell me now.
-I'm tellin' you right now,
I don't what is--

10:03.933 --> 10:06.800
-Well, I mean,
I've got a syringe
sittin' right there in the car.

10:06.833 --> 10:09.500
-I had nothin' to do
with the syringe, I was fighting
with the my husband tonight,

10:09.533 --> 10:11.433
'cause we were
in a heated argument...
-Is this your purse?

10:11.467 --> 10:12.867
-Yes.
-Okay. Let's see what in here.

10:12.900 --> 10:15.033
Am I gonna find anything illegal
in here?
-Oh...

10:15.067 --> 10:17.400
-Just tell me.
-Okay.

10:17.433 --> 10:21.033
-It's your purse, just tell me,
what am I gonna find in here
that's illegal.

10:21.067 --> 10:24.100
Tell me now.
-Um, think of nothing illegal...

10:24.133 --> 10:26.167
-Do you have any cocaine
in here?
-No.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.633
-Do you have any methamphetamine
in here?
-No.

10:28.667 --> 10:31.333
-Oh... we got here a kit
full of syringes.

10:31.367 --> 10:35.133
You got everything
to draw it up, the spoon...
what else am I gonna find

10:35.167 --> 10:37.833
in your purse, ma'am?
Is there any more syringes
in there?

10:37.867 --> 10:41.900
Oh, we got some more pills here.
You got a whole bunch
of pills here.

10:41.933 --> 10:46.233
What's the one on the top
right there?
-Um, there's an Opana,

10:46.267 --> 10:50.300
Roxy and Xanax.
-Wow, you got a smorgasbord
of drugs out here tonight.

10:50.333 --> 10:54.333
What's this one right here?
-That's Roxycodone.

10:54.367 --> 10:57.733
-What about this right here?
Is that cocaine?
-No, that's heroin.

10:57.767 --> 11:00.567
-Heroin? Okay.

11:00.600 --> 11:06.600
How long have you been
addicted to it?
-About a year.

11:06.633 --> 11:11.067
-What about this one right here?
-That is meth.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.067
I've never seen that many drugs
in one spot.

11:14.067 --> 11:17.067
You're under arrest
for multiple felonies.

11:17.100 --> 11:25.133
So you got meth, heroin,
Opana, Roxycodone
and various other pills.

11:25.167 --> 11:27.067
Just step right over here
with me.

11:27.100 --> 11:30.367
How do you know this guy?
I'm still trying to figure out
why he's got that empty syringe

11:30.400 --> 11:31.733
right there in front of him
on the floor.

11:31.767 --> 11:34.733
-Apparently
it was in his pocket...
-Yeah.

11:34.767 --> 11:36.733
-(radio chatter)
-Wow.

11:36.767 --> 11:41.633
Now I know why you didn't
want to tell me, man.
You got a burglary warrant, huh?

11:41.667 --> 11:44.567
-Who?
-You. You got a warrant
for burglary

11:44.600 --> 11:46.967
with a $60,000 bond.
-Multiple other warrants.

11:47.067 --> 11:50.433
-We're gonna put another charge
on you too, because you failed
to give me your name.

11:50.467 --> 11:52.867
-She had all those
different drugs.
These are all her "Owe" sheets.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.900
So you see, like...
-Wow.

11:54.933 --> 12:00.833
Cricket, $5.00,
Clayton, 10 roxys
at 25 each, $250.

12:00.867 --> 12:04.967
A lot of these
are just nicknames, or...
-Money owed for drugs.

12:05.067 --> 12:06.367
-Mm-hm.

12:06.400 --> 12:09.200
-Hey, Duncan, I'm just looking
for a little honesty here, okay?

12:09.233 --> 12:12.400
You got a syringe
right in front of you.
where you're sittin'.

12:12.433 --> 12:14.900
Obviously you're high
on something.
I can tell now, all right?

12:14.933 --> 12:18.400
-Heroin.
-Heroin? Okay, how long
have you been using it?

12:18.433 --> 12:23.233
-Uh...
-Just be honest.

12:23.267 --> 12:26.667
-No, I'm tryin' to think,
I mean, because I did it
once or twice and like...

12:26.700 --> 12:30.667
it's when I get stressed out,
man.
-Yeah?

12:30.700 --> 12:37.100
Obviously you used today.
How long ago did you use today?
-Uh, maybe four, five hours.

12:37.133 --> 12:40.933
-Okay. You go ahead
and have a seat back in the car.
I appreciate it, okay?

12:40.967 --> 12:45.200
Thank you for talking to me.
Here, hold on.

12:46.933 --> 12:51.900
Okay... can you tell me
a little bit about that book
that was in your purse?

12:51.933 --> 12:54.767
Looks like you been keepin'
pretty good tabs on people
that owe you money.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.500
And his name's in that book
as well as owin' you money.

12:57.533 --> 13:00.467
-Yeah, there are a lot of people
that owe me money.

13:00.500 --> 13:03.633
-Thousands of dollars for pills.
Where are you gettin'
all those pills from?

13:03.667 --> 13:05.733
-Pill? No, no, no no no...
-Different drugs,
different drugs...

13:05.767 --> 13:08.633
-No no no no no...
-It's the drugs are written
in the book.

13:08.667 --> 13:12.400
-No, that's, no, yeah.
That's... they'll give me
that as payment... for stuff.

13:12.433 --> 13:15.800
No no, that's not--
-For money they owe you?

13:15.833 --> 13:16.833
-Yeah.
-I got you.

13:16.867 --> 13:18.400
-That's what I was...
-I see, okay.

13:18.433 --> 13:20.733
Okay, you know
what you're being
charged with, right?

13:20.767 --> 13:24.633
-I'm assumin' all the stuff
that was in the bag.
-Yeah, possession of heroin,

13:24.667 --> 13:27.400
meth-- you got a smorgasbord
of pills.
-Ahh.

13:31.467 --> 13:33.800
Officer Angulo:
-I've been with the Metropolitan
Police Department
for 10 years now.

13:33.833 --> 13:35.900
I work an exciting part of town
here at Southeast Area Command.
We work the southeast side

13:35.933 --> 13:37.433
of the valley.
And we have a lot of residents

13:37.467 --> 13:39.767
who live here that work
within our own community--

13:39.800 --> 13:42.767
they work at the casinos,
they have houses down here,
they live in the apartments.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.467
We also have
kind of a transient area,
it's a high traveled area

13:45.500 --> 13:48.533
here on the east side too,
so we kind of have
a mix of both here.

13:48.567 --> 13:50.967
It keeps me busy,
and it's a fun shift to work.

13:51.067 --> 13:57.467
So here we have
a known prostitute in the area.
She goes by the name of Star.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.800
Let's sit and get a watch
here, approaching this vehicle.

13:59.833 --> 14:04.867
And see what she has going on,
'cause she is definitely
not talking to him

14:04.900 --> 14:07.233
just to be a good Samaritan.

14:07.267 --> 14:12.067
-(radio chatter)
-Negative, keep it
on both, please.

14:12.100 --> 14:15.600
Come here!
Come here!

14:15.633 --> 14:19.300
Stand in front of the car.
Step out of the car for me.

14:19.333 --> 14:23.333
Come here.
Come right here, I'm not gonna
put you in handcuffs.

14:23.367 --> 14:25.533
If you stop listening to me,
I will, okay?

14:25.567 --> 14:29.133
Step out of the car for me.
Let's all be polite, okay?
-Okay.

14:29.167 --> 14:31.467
-Put your hands
on that black bumper
for me.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.867
Place your keys on the hood
for me, please?

14:33.900 --> 14:35.900
Put your hands behind your back,
palms together.

14:35.933 --> 14:37.600
I just want to get your knife
from you.

14:37.633 --> 14:40.900
Put your-- behind your back,
palms together?
There you go.

14:40.933 --> 14:42.300
Where's your knife at?

14:42.333 --> 14:44.267
That's what I'm concerned about.
You understand why, right?

14:44.300 --> 14:46.833
-Yeah, I understand.
-Okay. You have anything else
on you, sir?

14:46.867 --> 14:48.733
-No...
-What's your name?

14:48.767 --> 14:50.300
-Ervin.
-Ervin?

14:50.333 --> 14:52.100
-Yes, sir?
-Yeah, you're being detained
right now, sir,

14:52.133 --> 14:57.267
under suspicion
for soliciting or engaging
in prostitution, okay?

14:57.300 --> 14:59.267
You know me, right?
-Yes.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.833
-Of course you do.
Let me ask you a question, sir.

15:01.867 --> 15:04.467
What are you doing
talking to her out here?
-She was walking by,

15:04.500 --> 15:06.867
she looked good. I mean,
I'm a man, you know.
-Okay.

15:06.900 --> 15:11.067
-I don't do that anymore.
I have a court date.
-So you're not working?

15:11.100 --> 15:15.333
-No, he asked me
for my phone number.
And I was giving it to him.

15:15.367 --> 15:19.533
-You expect me to believe that?
-No, I'm dead serious.

15:19.567 --> 15:24.067
I already got a court date.
-How many times have I seen you
out here doing this,

15:24.067 --> 15:26.133
and have you seen me
out here doing this?

15:26.167 --> 15:30.600
-(indistinct)
-Listen, call it
what you want it, it's a job.

15:30.633 --> 15:33.200
There's a reason why
we run into each other
all the time, right?

15:33.233 --> 15:37.067
'Cause for 40 hours a week
I'm driving this thing, right?
-Yeah.

15:37.067 --> 15:39.700
-Listen, it is what it is.
I'm not looking down on you.

15:39.733 --> 15:42.633
Okay?
Some people sell drugs
for a living.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.800
Does it make 'em bad people
or is it just a lifestyle?
-Just a lifestyle.

15:45.833 --> 15:48.300
-Okay.
I mean, in the grand scheme
of things.

15:48.333 --> 15:50.200
are you hurting anyone?
-No.

15:50.233 --> 15:52.333
-Okay. It just happens
to be illegal, right?
-Yes.

15:52.367 --> 15:56.600
-Can I say one thing, officer?
She doesn't look like
your average prostitute,

15:56.633 --> 15:59.267
I mean, she looks good.
-What does
your average prostitute

15:59.300 --> 16:01.367
look like?
-Most are ran through,
burnt out, I mean,

16:01.400 --> 16:04.733
she just look good to me,
just...
-She's a youngster too.

16:04.767 --> 16:09.667
Okay.
So there's a reason why,
and again, I'm not judging you.

16:09.700 --> 16:12.633
Okay? You have to understand
one thing, that we live
in a world

16:12.667 --> 16:14.667
where you can believe
whatever you wanna believe,

16:14.700 --> 16:16.300
especially
in this country, right?

16:16.333 --> 16:19.133
You know that people
look at you with more respect
than they look at me?

16:19.167 --> 16:21.067
There's some people
that just don't like
what we do.

16:21.067 --> 16:24.133
And no disrespect to you,
you don't know this guy.
-Right.

16:24.167 --> 16:26.567
-What if he pulled a gun out
and forced you in the car?
-Right.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.733
-How tall are you?
-I'm five four.

16:28.767 --> 16:31.267
-Five two? Five four?
Okay. You don't look like
you're strong enough

16:31.300 --> 16:34.167
to fight this guy off.
-(laughs) Right.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.933
-Okay. Now let me ask you
a serious question, man to man,
not man in police uniform

16:37.967 --> 16:39.900
to man standing in front
of police car.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.867
How often
do you get phone numbers
from girls

16:41.900 --> 16:43.433
walking through parking lots?

16:43.467 --> 16:45.733
-Um, actually not a lot
because I mean,

16:45.767 --> 16:48.400
I was at the point
to get married,

16:48.433 --> 16:52.533
but there was trouble
in paradise, so...
-Didn't work out with you?

16:52.567 --> 16:55.933
-Yeah, so I'm now
a single father with my sons.
-Okay.

16:55.967 --> 16:59.200
How often do you
just meet gentlemen like this
on a normal night?

16:59.233 --> 17:03.433
-It's... like...
when it's slow, not really.

17:03.467 --> 17:06.200
-Mm-hm.
Slow time of year for you,
'cause of weather?

17:06.233 --> 17:08.667
-Yeah.
-Okay.

17:08.700 --> 17:10.833
Do you plan
on doing this forever?
-No.

17:10.867 --> 17:13.067
-Okay.

17:13.100 --> 17:16.567
He said it. You're not
blown out, like most
of these girls out here.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.767
-Okay, you don't look rough...
-Got all her teeth.

17:18.800 --> 17:23.533
-Yeah. You're clean,
you're good looking... okay?
You're young.

17:23.567 --> 17:25.533
You have your whole life
ahead of you.
-Yeah.

17:25.567 --> 17:28.067
-Do you have a plan?
-Going to school.

17:28.100 --> 17:30.400
-Okay, what are you
going to school for?
-Criminal justice.

17:30.433 --> 17:33.367
-Okay. (laughs)
Criminal justice.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.767
-Yes.
-Okay. In hopes
of doing what?

17:36.800 --> 17:40.400
-Becoming a lawyer.
-A lawyer, well,
that's not a bad start.

17:40.433 --> 17:43.067
I guess it's good to know
the ins and the outs
of it, right?

17:43.100 --> 17:45.200
-Yeah.
-Okay. If I wouldn't
have showed up,

17:45.233 --> 17:47.700
what would've happened tonight?
-I would've took him home.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.433
-You would've took him home.
-Yes.

17:50.467 --> 17:52.633
-Is that what you were looking
to achieve tonight?
-Yeah.

17:52.667 --> 17:55.600
-Not right now, but later on,
yeah, I mean, I would like
to get to know her

17:55.633 --> 17:58.933
and maybe see what she's about,
and she's a beautiful
young lady.

17:58.967 --> 18:01.767
-And he's cute.
-Maybe she's just lookin'
for that one...

18:01.800 --> 18:04.767
-The right one?
-Exactly.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.100
-You never know unless you try,
right?
-Yeah.

18:07.133 --> 18:11.900
-Okay. Well, unfortunately,
you're gonna have to go
with me tonight, okay?

18:11.933 --> 18:15.067
-All right.
-Okay. I know you may not
see it this way,

18:15.067 --> 18:17.900
but in some weird way,
I think getting out of here
is gonna help you.

18:17.933 --> 18:21.067
Okay? And you're
gonna get a ticket tonight.

18:21.067 --> 18:24.300
Okay? I don't want to find you
back out here doing
this kind of thing.

18:24.333 --> 18:28.600
Okay? 'Cause there's a lot of--
as minor as this seems for you
most importantly,

18:28.633 --> 18:32.967
as minor as this seems
right now, the residual effects
of what you're doing

18:33.067 --> 18:36.500
are kinda large.
Okay? And that goes back to,
if this guy wanted

18:36.533 --> 18:39.167
to take something from you.
Whatever that may be.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.800
Impose his manpower on you
or just kind of harm you
in any way.

18:42.833 --> 18:46.100
-I had a question,
would it still be possible
to like, get her number?

18:46.133 --> 18:49.967
-Well, that's between you guys.
-So, I don't see a phone
with her.

18:50.067 --> 18:54.400
-I mean, like I told her
when I call her, I mean,
to me,

18:54.433 --> 18:56.967
she don't belong out here,
she's too beautiful
to be out here, you know?

18:57.067 --> 18:58.767
She look too good.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.100
Like I said most of these girls
out here that are doin' that...

19:02.133 --> 19:03.500
Uh-uh.

19:03.533 --> 19:06.367
-Well, whatever
two consenting adults
want to do,

19:06.400 --> 19:10.067
I mean, you can ask her
right now, 'cause she's gonna be
going with me, so...

19:10.067 --> 19:13.167
Can you put my number
on her books or something?

19:13.200 --> 19:15.967
-(laughs)
-You gonna put money
on her books?

19:16.067 --> 19:20.833
-I wouldn't mind, I mean,
but I would like a letter
or something, you know at least.

19:20.867 --> 19:24.067
-Okay. I mean, I can give you
a pen and paper to leave
your number with her

19:24.100 --> 19:26.933
if she wants to take it.
We can facilitate that.

19:26.967 --> 19:30.100
-No. I mean,
if it's meant to be,
it's meant to be.

19:30.133 --> 19:35.067
-Final goodbyes?
Okay, ma'am, put your hands
behind your back for me,

19:35.067 --> 19:36.667
okay?
Palms together, please?

19:36.700 --> 19:39.400
Maybe in the grand scheme
of things you really were
trying to help her,

19:39.433 --> 19:42.133
but unfortunately,
you're in violation
of Nevada, okay?

19:42.167 --> 19:43.933
Okay, let's walk around
to this side of the car, okay?

19:43.967 --> 19:44.967
Hang tight for me, sir.

19:45.067 --> 19:46.067
We're gonna get you
a citation.

19:46.067 --> 19:47.167
You can be on your way
tonight, okay?

19:47.200 --> 19:48.867
-Yes, sir.

19:48.900 --> 19:50.500
-Officer over radio:
132 and Bush.

19:50.533 --> 19:51.833
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.867 --> 19:53.933
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.967 --> 19:54.967
Cover is code three.

19:55.067 --> 19:58.933
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:03.967 --> 20:05.967
-Dispatcher:
Okay, still send a code three.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.500
