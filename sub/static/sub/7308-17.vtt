WEBVTT

00:04.379 --> 00:07.424
Almost there, boys.
Just five more to go.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.676
- Minutes?
- Miles, Jerry.

00:11.553 --> 00:14.223
Hold up. Come here. Come on.

00:14.389 --> 00:15.599
This here's your lucky day.

00:17.434 --> 00:19.520
- You know what we got here?
- Yeah.

00:19.686 --> 00:23.982
- A seriously mammoth pile of--
- Bear scat. Fresh.

00:24.233 --> 00:28.529
Any brave soul wanna investigate
this particular bear's diet?

00:28.695 --> 00:30.322
Sure.

00:30.822 --> 00:33.492
My old man always said
l was full of this stuff anyway.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.954
Now, bears are omnivores.
They'll basically eat anything.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.707
lt's not unusual
to find digested berries, deer sinew,

00:40.958 --> 00:42.709
even bones
in a single scat specimen.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.463
So, Jerry, tell us.
What's this one been eating?

00:48.632 --> 00:49.842
l think maybe people.

01:40.743 --> 01:42.662
Trust me. You gotta see this.

01:44.038 --> 01:46.457
- l'd rather shower.
- Every newbie's worst nightmare.

01:46.749 --> 01:51.087
This liver shows signs
of advanced cirrhosis.

01:51.254 --> 01:54.757
lt's clearly consistent with
the jaundiced skin we noticed earlier.

01:54.924 --> 01:57.844
Now, if you'll come closer,
you'll be able to see

01:58.011 --> 02:01.055
the inflammation of the pancreas.

02:01.222 --> 02:04.058
Oh, hello.
Scalpel, please, Mr. Palmer.

02:04.267 --> 02:07.270
Every cadaver
has its own story to tell.

02:07.437 --> 02:10.023
ln many cases,
it's just a whisper that reveals--

02:10.189 --> 02:13.443
All new agents are required
to observe an autopsy.

02:13.776 --> 02:15.361
You should have seen McGee.

02:16.446 --> 02:17.780
Hurled.

02:18.656 --> 02:21.492
Emptied the contents of his stomach
onto Ducky's shoes.

02:21.659 --> 02:26.289
lt's not only visual cues we look for.
Odours can be helpful too.

02:26.456 --> 02:28.291
Note the putrid smell.

02:28.458 --> 02:30.543
l think he's talking about you, Tony.

02:31.961 --> 02:33.462
There's no need to be shy.

02:33.629 --> 02:35.965
Odours like sticks and stones--

02:36.132 --> 02:37.675
We had the same test at Mossad.

02:37.842 --> 02:39.802
lf you fail, they terminate you.

02:39.969 --> 02:41.178
How do you fail an autopsy?

02:41.887 --> 02:43.139
By doing that.

02:43.347 --> 02:46.559
- What happens if you fail here?
- lt depends, Officer David.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.477
Some of them go on
to become our director.

02:49.186 --> 02:51.480
You're gonna have to reschedule
your class, Duck.

02:51.981 --> 02:53.816
The rangers found a body
in Shenandoah Park.

02:53.983 --> 02:57.820
Well, perhaps you'd be willing
to share the specifics with the class.

02:57.987 --> 03:01.699
Yes, the three most frequent causes
of death in our national parks

03:01.907 --> 03:07.163
are heart attacks, hiking accidents and
prolonged exposure to the elements.

03:07.329 --> 03:09.999
Not this time.
A sailor was eaten...

03:11.834 --> 03:12.877
...by a bear.

03:27.683 --> 03:30.102
Yet another reason
why l never wanna go camping.

03:30.269 --> 03:32.521
Actually, Tony,
bear attacks are quite rare.

03:32.688 --> 03:34.607
- Really?
- Do you wanna tell this guy that?

03:34.774 --> 03:38.360
- Not a big fan of nature, huh?
- l'm a big fan of nature

03:38.527 --> 03:39.695
as long as it's on TV.

03:41.530 --> 03:44.325
l'd say 325 pounds.

03:44.533 --> 03:46.410
Maybe 6 foot, standing, Agent Gibbs.

03:46.619 --> 03:48.621
You found the dog tags here,
Ranger Hendricks?

03:48.829 --> 03:50.372
On the other side
of the clearing.

03:50.539 --> 03:53.459
l followed the tracks back
and found--

03:53.626 --> 03:55.377
Found what was left of his body.

03:57.379 --> 04:00.758
Well, name matches the dog tags
recovered by the park rangers.

04:00.966 --> 04:02.760
Petty Officer Benjamin Riley.

04:02.968 --> 04:04.220
Bag it. Probie,

04:04.553 --> 04:06.764
you were a Boy Scout
or whatever, right?

04:07.431 --> 04:09.892
Yeah. Well, technically,
l was a Webelos, but--

04:10.059 --> 04:12.144
Whatever. Use your expertise,

04:12.394 --> 04:14.647
and go and bag and tag
that bear poo down there.

04:16.940 --> 04:18.108
Bag the poo.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.320
Here.

04:21.487 --> 04:22.863
When you're done collecting scat,

04:23.072 --> 04:25.866
- find out what happened to Ducky.
- Got it, boss.

04:26.075 --> 04:28.744
This entire area was supposed
to be off-limits to campers.

04:28.911 --> 04:30.746
A hunter was bear baiting
here last month.

04:30.955 --> 04:32.123
Bear baiting?

04:32.331 --> 04:35.251
Have you spent any time in the woods,
Special Agent DiNozzo?

04:35.751 --> 04:37.419
Well...

04:37.586 --> 04:41.090
As much time as l can, l'm in the
woods. l'm a big fan of Mother Nature.

04:41.257 --> 04:44.844
ln the off-season, hunters set out food,
always in the same place.

04:45.928 --> 04:49.014
Bears get used to being fed and come
season, all they have to do is wait.

04:49.181 --> 04:52.476
That's clever. l'll have to try that
the next time l'm out.

04:52.643 --> 04:53.853
lt's illegal, Tony.

04:54.019 --> 04:56.522
lf l had my way,
hunting would be too.

04:56.689 --> 04:58.274
Who was baiting the bear?

04:58.441 --> 05:01.277
A local. Jason Edom.
We pulled his license

05:01.444 --> 05:03.612
- and banned him from the park.
- For life.

05:03.779 --> 05:07.158
Petty Officer Riley know
this was a potentially dangerous area?

05:07.324 --> 05:09.243
We hand this out to every visitor.

05:10.494 --> 05:11.787
Had a bad drought this year.

05:13.330 --> 05:15.124
Berries the bears feed on
have been scarce.

05:15.332 --> 05:17.001
A hungry bear
will eat about anything.

05:17.168 --> 05:19.837
The sad fact is they're gonna
track down this bear and kill it

05:20.045 --> 05:22.089
because your stupid sailor
couldn't be bothered

05:22.256 --> 05:23.632
to read a three-page pamphlet.

05:24.175 --> 05:27.553
You'll have to forgive her. She's what
we like to call opposed to hunting.

05:27.803 --> 05:30.973
Yes, that's not
the only thing she's opposed to.

05:31.474 --> 05:32.808
You said Riley checked in alone?

05:32.975 --> 05:35.936
Monday afternoon.
l signed him in myself.

05:36.145 --> 05:37.730
We need to organize a search.

05:37.897 --> 05:40.816
l'm one step ahead of you. l've got
a team out tracking the bear now.

05:41.066 --> 05:43.694
lf he's still in the area,
we'll find him.

05:43.861 --> 05:45.488
l'm more concerned about the woman.

05:47.239 --> 05:48.491
There's two sets of footprints.

05:50.242 --> 05:53.078
One is Riley's.
The other's a ladies' size 7.

05:53.245 --> 05:55.080
Are you sure about that?

05:55.498 --> 05:56.749
Yeah.

05:56.916 --> 06:00.169
Unless these are Navy issue.

06:02.296 --> 06:05.633
Listen up.
l want four-man teams in each sector.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.052
At least two of them
armed with rifles.

06:08.219 --> 06:09.970
She's been out there
at least two nights,

06:10.137 --> 06:13.307
possibly injured and most definitely
scared out of her mind.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.519
All communications
will run through mountain tac one.

06:16.685 --> 06:18.479
All right, let's go.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.523
They worked
search and rescue in the park

06:20.689 --> 06:21.982
before l got stationed here.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.986
- They'll find her.
- Hope it's before the bear does.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.659
l'm sorry we were so late, Jethro.

06:31.826 --> 06:35.037
Mr. Palmer's navigating skills
still leave something to be desired.

06:35.246 --> 06:38.165
Honestly, doctor, l thought that
moss grew on the south side of trees.

06:38.332 --> 06:40.918
lt does, in Australia.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.922
Petty Officer Riley's vehicle
isn't in the parking lot.

06:45.089 --> 06:48.342
According to the red--
The local guys,

06:48.509 --> 06:50.261
campers park their cars
at the general store

06:50.427 --> 06:52.680
- outside the main gate.
- Park's been having problems

06:52.847 --> 06:55.683
with vandalism and theft
of unattended vehicles.

06:55.891 --> 06:57.852
- Find it, DiNozzo.
- On it, boss.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.854
Move over, Palmer. l'm driving.

07:00.646 --> 07:02.690
- Don't.
- Don't what?

07:02.857 --> 07:04.024
Don't encourage them, probie.

07:04.233 --> 07:06.527
<i>- Didn't you ever see Deliverance?
- No.</i>

07:06.694 --> 07:10.239
When you do, just remember that l'm
Burt Reynolds and you're Ned Beatty.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.882
lt's Riley's.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.550
''Jackrabbit Slim's''?

07:29.717 --> 07:31.260
<i>Just like the diner in Pulp Fiction.</i>

07:32.928 --> 07:34.346
You can't say ''porcupine,''

07:34.513 --> 07:36.056
<i>but you know the diner
from Pulp Fiction?</i>

07:36.223 --> 07:39.268
Believe it or not, we actually have
movie theatres in my country.

07:39.435 --> 07:41.479
- Locked.
- Keys are probably inside.

07:41.979 --> 07:43.564
Afternoon.

07:43.731 --> 07:46.192
Five-dollar shakes.
Girls dressed like Marilyn.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.736
This might be a little slice of heaven.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.074
Or not.

07:57.953 --> 08:00.289
Do you feel like dancing?

08:02.583 --> 08:03.751
They drinking cappuccinos?

08:03.918 --> 08:06.420
Probably fuelling up
for the banjo-duelling contest later.

08:08.756 --> 08:11.383
- What's that?
- Those are scones.

08:11.550 --> 08:13.761
They're like an English coffee pastry.

08:13.928 --> 08:17.348
l think, probie, that Ziva was referring
to the jar next to the scones.

08:17.598 --> 08:20.309
Those are pickled pigs feet, Ziva.
l think you'd enjoy them.

08:21.060 --> 08:24.688
l'll pass on that.
They're not exactly kosher.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.941
Can l help you folks?

08:27.108 --> 08:30.778
- l'll take a double shot, extra foam.
- NClS.

08:32.321 --> 08:34.365
You here about
the sailor eaten by the bear?

08:34.615 --> 08:36.741
Well, yeah, l guess his car
is in your parking lot.

08:36.951 --> 08:38.159
Yep.

08:38.369 --> 08:40.121
l figured someone
would show up for it.

08:40.328 --> 08:44.207
l charge park visitors ten bucks a day.
l'm gonna have a hard time collecting.

08:45.042 --> 08:47.628
- That's a good guess.
- Jason.

08:47.837 --> 08:49.171
The key to the Cherokee.

08:50.714 --> 08:53.175
Jason Edom?

08:57.471 --> 09:00.474
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Jason.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.351
l know you, lady?

09:03.144 --> 09:04.645
Not yet.

09:04.812 --> 09:07.148
You see anyone with PO Riley
when he dropped that off?

09:07.314 --> 09:08.983
Nope. You?

09:09.191 --> 09:10.484
Nope.

09:11.026 --> 09:13.154
You're wasting your time,
sweetheart.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.156
l don't date your kind.

09:17.825 --> 09:21.704
What is your kind, Mr. Edom?
Breathing?

09:21.871 --> 09:23.205
You wanna keep working here?

09:23.372 --> 09:25.249
You better learn
to keep your damn mouth shut.

09:28.419 --> 09:31.672
l'm sorry about that, miss.
The boy's a little on the touchy side.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.716
Yeah, l'd say so.

09:33.924 --> 09:36.177
Thank you for your help.

09:37.553 --> 09:39.180
Ziva, come on. Let's go.

09:42.391 --> 09:46.687
The American black bear has a narrow
muzzle and a large, hinged jaw

09:46.854 --> 09:48.731
with enormous crushing power.

09:48.898 --> 09:51.025
600 pounds per square inch.

09:51.192 --> 09:55.321
No animal of equal size
is nearly so strong.

09:55.529 --> 09:57.406
You never discovered any of that,
did you?

09:57.615 --> 10:01.035
- How do you know that?
- When Mr. Palmer sponged him,

10:01.202 --> 10:06.540
we didn't find any evidence of slashing
or wounds on his hand and forearm.

10:06.749 --> 10:09.627
- He didn't defend himself.
- More than that, l'm afraid.

10:09.877 --> 10:12.463
The bear's claws and teeth

10:12.630 --> 10:16.383
have rounded edges
that pierce the flesh.

10:16.192 --> 10:20.655
Yet when l examined Mr. Riley's heart,
it revealed a very different story.

10:22.156 --> 10:26.494
Our petty officer
was killed with a flat blade.

10:28.496 --> 10:30.498
Death would
have been instantaneous.

10:31.165 --> 10:33.209
Yes, he was dead.

10:33.418 --> 10:35.837
Before the bear started eating him.

10:45.012 --> 10:48.933
According to Petty Officer Riley's C.O.,
he's been on leave the last six days.

10:49.142 --> 10:51.310
Nice vacation. A little camping.

10:51.519 --> 10:54.355
A knife to the heart. A little trip
inside a bear's digestive track.

10:54.564 --> 10:56.524
- Yeah, l'd fire my travel agent.
- Yeah.

10:56.733 --> 10:58.359
You're late, Ziva David.

10:58.526 --> 11:01.487
l almost forgot it was Abby's birthday.
Do you think she'll like them?

11:02.947 --> 11:04.657
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

11:05.658 --> 11:06.701
Thanks.

11:09.412 --> 11:11.831
- Think we should have told her?
- No.

11:11.998 --> 11:13.458
No, me neither.

11:22.884 --> 11:25.219
Little square, little square,
where have you been?

11:25.386 --> 11:27.889
Stuck on the behind
of Riley's missing girlfriend.

11:31.059 --> 11:33.686
Oh, hey. l was just about
to call Tony and McGee.

11:33.895 --> 11:35.563
l think they were having sex.

11:35.730 --> 11:39.233
- Tony and McGee?
- No. Riley and the missing girl.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.735
l found this in their camp trash.

11:40.902 --> 11:44.030
One of those little sticky thingies
you use when trying to quit smoking.

11:44.238 --> 11:47.867
But it had residue of medication on it.
lt was progestin and oestrogen.

11:48.034 --> 11:49.202
Birth-control patch.

11:49.369 --> 11:52.372
- Yes. ls that burrito for me?
- Nope.

11:53.039 --> 11:55.041
But these are.

11:57.919 --> 11:59.087
Happy birthday, Abby.

11:59.253 --> 12:03.758
Thank you so much.
You shouldn't have.

12:03.925 --> 12:06.886
You're right.
l guess l shouldn't have.

12:07.053 --> 12:08.971
l mean, l could get you
something else.

12:09.138 --> 12:10.431
No.

12:11.349 --> 12:13.309
l love them.

12:13.476 --> 12:16.938
Hey, is Gibbs in yet?

12:17.688 --> 12:20.608
- l haven't seen him.
- Okay.

12:22.110 --> 12:23.694
ls something wrong?

12:24.070 --> 12:26.781
No. Nope. Nothing's wrong.

12:28.282 --> 12:31.828
lt's just that every year,
Gibbs usually takes me out to dinner

12:31.994 --> 12:34.789
the night before my birthday.
lt's like a tradition.

12:35.289 --> 12:37.291
Well, he probably just forgot.

12:38.793 --> 12:40.128
Yeah.

12:40.294 --> 12:41.629
l mean because of the case.

12:41.796 --> 12:43.339
- l could remind him when l--
- No.

12:43.715 --> 12:45.174
Don't remind him.

12:45.341 --> 12:48.636
lt's really no big deal. l mean,
l don't wanna distract him

12:48.803 --> 12:51.848
and Gibbs is gonna want
a name to go with this patch,

12:52.014 --> 12:53.766
and that means
that l have work to do.

12:53.933 --> 12:55.852
Thank you for the flowers.

13:08.489 --> 13:09.657
Nice flowers, Ducky.

13:09.824 --> 13:12.702
l should hope so. l went
to four flower shops to find them.

13:12.869 --> 13:16.205
Apparently, they're sold out
all over the city.

13:22.587 --> 13:25.298
What if we're not looking
for a damsel in distress here, probie?

13:26.674 --> 13:28.718
No one saw our missing Jane Doe.

13:28.968 --> 13:31.512
Not the rangers
when Riley checked in.

13:31.679 --> 13:33.681
Or the hillbillies
when he parked his car.

13:33.848 --> 13:35.892
- She didn't wanna be seen.
- We could be dealing

13:36.100 --> 13:38.478
- with a black widow here.
- Lions and spiders and bears.

13:38.853 --> 13:40.188
Oh, my.

13:40.855 --> 13:44.025
<i>What, Mr. Movie doesn't know
The Wizard of Oz?</i>

13:46.861 --> 13:49.906
l'm talking about
a predatory female here, Ziva.

13:50.073 --> 13:51.824
Mates, then kills.

13:51.991 --> 13:54.202
Reminds me
of my father's second wife.

13:54.744 --> 13:56.996
- l don't buy your theory.
- Well, what's to buy?

13:57.163 --> 13:59.874
She lured him out to the woods,
made love to him, then whacked him

14:00.041 --> 14:01.751
- while he was sleeping.
- Or ran off

14:01.918 --> 14:04.587
while Riley was being
stabbed to death.

14:04.796 --> 14:06.547
- How about neither?
- Rough night, boss?

14:06.714 --> 14:09.425
Well, yeah, DiNozzo.
l spent it tracking our missing woman

14:09.675 --> 14:11.886
with a bunch of volunteers
in Shenandoah Park.

14:12.053 --> 14:13.429
- You found her?
- No.

14:13.596 --> 14:16.057
- So she's still out there?
- Park Service thinks so.

14:16.224 --> 14:17.392
Here, McGee.

14:17.558 --> 14:21.229
Take the film dooeywhacker out
of there and put it up on the plasma.

14:21.396 --> 14:24.107
Well, boss, actually,
this is a digital camera.

14:24.273 --> 14:25.942
They use memory cards now.

14:26.109 --> 14:28.444
l'll put the dooeywhacker in.

14:31.406 --> 14:32.907
There wasn't a sign or track

14:33.074 --> 14:35.410
of a ladies' size 7 boot
ever leaving that campground.

14:35.576 --> 14:38.121
- How'd she get out here, boss?
- Like this.

14:41.124 --> 14:45.044
- So, what's this?
- Snipers call that a ghost, DiNozzo.

14:45.211 --> 14:47.922
Someone who can move
through the woods almost undetected.

14:48.089 --> 14:51.759
l followed them for 300 meters
before l lost them.

14:51.926 --> 14:54.053
They only left two obvious signs.

14:54.220 --> 14:56.931
The back edge
of a military boot heel,

14:57.724 --> 14:58.933
and this.

15:01.144 --> 15:04.105
- Jewellery?
- Get it to Abby.

15:04.272 --> 15:05.648
You think someone
carried her away?

15:05.815 --> 15:08.234
Ziva, l think she didn't just
float out of that campsite.

15:08.443 --> 15:10.278
We need to find out who she is.

15:10.445 --> 15:13.281
Right. l talked to the guys Riley
worked with at the Navy Yard.

15:13.489 --> 15:16.951
Only one of them, a Seaman Brad
Phillips, knew he was going camping.

15:17.118 --> 15:20.580
Riley mentioned taking a girl he met
weeks ago. Phillips never got a name.

15:20.747 --> 15:23.583
- Pull Riley's phone records.
- Has a cell phone he doesn't use.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.627
Went back two weeks. Made a couple
of calls to his family in New York,

15:26.794 --> 15:29.297
and the rest were to local businesses
and government agencies.

15:29.505 --> 15:32.133
- Check out his room.
- Went through his room.

15:32.300 --> 15:34.052
Nothing unusual.
No sign of a girlfriend.

15:34.218 --> 15:37.388
Rangers set up a temporary aid centre
inside Jackrabbit Slim's for volunteers.

15:37.555 --> 15:39.891
l want you both there.
l had them pull the files

15:40.058 --> 15:42.477
of all other deaths
that happened in that park.

15:44.979 --> 15:47.315
Looks like another chance to hit
on that cute ranger, yes?

15:47.482 --> 15:50.401
lt's gonna be tough but not impossible.
Misreads are part of the game.

15:50.651 --> 15:54.489
True, except l was talking about me.

16:02.330 --> 16:04.165
Maybe she drove out here
on her own.

16:04.332 --> 16:06.501
That's why no one saw her
with Riley.

16:06.667 --> 16:08.336
Registration could give us a name.

16:08.503 --> 16:10.838
l assume Gibbs would have
checked that out last night.

16:11.005 --> 16:12.548
Rule eight,
never assume anything.

16:12.715 --> 16:15.343
To be precise,
it's ''never take anything for granted.''

16:15.510 --> 16:20.056
To be more precise, what would
you do if l started head-slapping you?

16:20.515 --> 16:24.018
l'd most likely kill you.
lt's a reflex thing.

16:26.521 --> 16:28.356
Gentlemen.

16:28.940 --> 16:31.025
People with guns make me nervous.

16:31.192 --> 16:34.028
- l noticed.
- l was talking about you, actually.

16:39.867 --> 16:42.745
Still holding any vehicles
for campers?

16:42.912 --> 16:46.999
Your Agent Gibbs asked
the same question last night. Nope.

16:47.166 --> 16:49.335
Looks like the search is good
for business. Yes?

16:50.586 --> 16:51.879
Yeah.

16:56.342 --> 16:59.220
Special Agent DiNozzo. Ziva.

16:59.679 --> 17:01.681
- Find anything?
- Not yet.

17:01.848 --> 17:05.268
We've expanded the search area
beyond the initial five-mile radius.

17:05.435 --> 17:07.436
lf she was abducted,
she could be anywhere.

17:07.603 --> 17:09.355
Park's 1 98,000 acres.

17:09.521 --> 17:11.065
That's over 300 square miles.

17:11.232 --> 17:14.902
- lt's a big area to patrol.
- Yeah, unless you like to exercise.

17:15.944 --> 17:18.196
Well, as a matter of fact,
l like to walk and--

17:18.364 --> 17:21.701
Our boss would like any records
you have on deaths in the park.

17:21.867 --> 17:24.912
- Bobby?
- Follow me.

17:27.623 --> 17:29.584
These are every death
over the last ten years.

17:29.876 --> 17:31.919
All ruled natural or accidental.

17:32.086 --> 17:34.422
Thank you. Listen, l just wanted to--

17:34.589 --> 17:36.424
We may have gotten off
on the wrong foot,

17:36.758 --> 17:39.594
and l just wanted to let you know
that l'm not a hunter.

17:41.012 --> 17:43.139
l was trying to impress you.

17:43.431 --> 17:46.434
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:50.146 --> 17:52.231
Got anything?

17:52.398 --> 17:54.609
Define ''anything.''

17:55.485 --> 17:57.737
- No, thanks.
- Hair follicles?

17:58.988 --> 18:01.324
- Our missing woman?
- Most likely.

18:01.491 --> 18:05.453
- And?
- And Caucasian. Brunette.

18:05.620 --> 18:09.165
lt's at the anagen, or growth, stage,
so l can probably get DNA off the root.

18:09.457 --> 18:12.877
- What about the one on the right?
- lt's from Petty Officer Riley's car.

18:13.044 --> 18:15.129
- They're from the same person.
- She drove with him.

18:15.296 --> 18:17.965
- You think?
- ls something bothering you, Abby?

18:18.800 --> 18:22.970
No. l did a further test on our lady's
birth-control method of choice.

18:23.137 --> 18:24.847
lt's a low-level oestrogen patch.

18:25.014 --> 18:27.517
Prescription dosage is based
on weight and height.

18:27.767 --> 18:30.478
So odds are she's
of average to small stature.

18:30.645 --> 18:32.438
ls there anything else
l can do for you?

18:34.982 --> 18:37.151
Find me a name.

18:43.658 --> 18:47.286
<i>Now l know how Molly Ringwald felt
in Sixteen Candles.</i>

18:48.037 --> 18:49.664
Slam dunk.

18:49.831 --> 18:51.165
We're going out next weekend.

18:54.335 --> 18:59.549
That's not bad, Tony.
Landis asked me out tonight.

19:00.007 --> 19:02.552
l said no.
l don't want him to think l'm sleazy.

19:02.719 --> 19:04.053
The term is ''easy.''

19:04.303 --> 19:06.472
- What's the difference?
- Mostly the makeup.

19:06.681 --> 19:08.975
- What do we have?
- Over the last seven years,

19:09.142 --> 19:10.685
there's been eight deaths
in the park.

19:10.852 --> 19:13.688
Three from natural causes, a stroke
and two heart attacks.

19:13.855 --> 19:15.523
- The others?
- All accidental.

19:15.690 --> 19:18.359
ln 2000, a couple drowned
while canoeing.

19:18.526 --> 19:20.194
The woman's body
was never recovered.

19:20.361 --> 19:23.573
ln 2002, a couple got lost hiking.
Their remains were recovered last year.

19:23.740 --> 19:27.869
- ln 2004, a woman named--
- Tracy Roberts' body was discovered

19:28.036 --> 19:31.539
nine months after she went
into the park to photograph wildlife.

19:31.706 --> 19:33.166
- Her remains were--
- Too ravaged

19:33.332 --> 19:36.002
by animals and the elements
to determine a cause of death.

19:36.169 --> 19:38.463
- l wanna see a profile on them.
- l found something.

19:38.629 --> 19:39.922
- Passports. Get me--
- Boss?

19:40.089 --> 19:42.008
- What, McGee?
- Sorry.

19:42.175 --> 19:43.384
l found something here.

19:43.551 --> 19:46.345
The three dead women,
they all fit the same description.

19:46.512 --> 19:49.390
- Twenties, Caucasian--
- Brunette, petite?

19:50.099 --> 19:51.350
Yeah.

19:51.517 --> 19:53.561
Since we all know
how you feel about coincidences,

19:53.770 --> 19:56.105
l decided
to pull their driver's license photos.

20:02.862 --> 20:04.572
Wow, they look like
they could be sisters.

20:04.739 --> 20:08.409
Something tells me their deaths
weren't exactly accidental.

20:09.118 --> 20:14.374
We're dealing with a killer who's using
park accidents to cover up murder.

20:21.214 --> 20:24.133
Three almost identical women.
All of them end up dead

20:24.300 --> 20:26.219
in Shenandoah National Park.

20:26.386 --> 20:28.763
And if our missing woman
fits the same profile,

20:28.930 --> 20:32.016
we could be dealing with a serial killer.
One who uses park accidents

20:32.183 --> 20:34.185
to cover up abductions and murder.

20:34.560 --> 20:37.230
- So, what do you think?
- l'm not sure yet, McGee.

20:37.397 --> 20:40.733
But l think that
this might be unforgivable.

20:41.234 --> 20:43.403
Well, yeah.
Of course it's unforgivable.

20:43.569 --> 20:46.072
- What if he had a really good reason?
- A good reason?

20:46.239 --> 20:50.034
Yeah, like he was really stressed out
or, like, overworked.

20:50.201 --> 20:52.829
- What difference does that make?
- Nobody's perfect.

20:52.995 --> 20:57.083
- Abby, there is no excuse.
- McGee, that's so sweet.

20:57.250 --> 21:01.170
You know what? lt's just a stupid
birthday. Who cares if Gibbs forgot?

21:01.879 --> 21:03.715
Why, l guess that l do.

21:03.881 --> 21:05.383
That's why l love you.

21:05.591 --> 21:08.511
When you get all hot and bothered
like that, it really turns me on.

21:08.678 --> 21:10.179
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

21:10.763 --> 21:12.432
Are you two done playing grab-assy?

21:12.598 --> 21:16.728
Or do l need to transfer McGee
to a weather station in the Antarctic?

21:16.894 --> 21:19.939
- We were just--
- l think l found our missing girl, Gibbs.

21:20.106 --> 21:22.275
And McGee
was just congratulating me.

21:22.442 --> 21:24.944
The birth-control patch
that our Jane Doe was wearing

21:25.111 --> 21:27.196
turned out to be a Rosetta stone.

21:27.363 --> 21:29.991
lt delivers
a very specific oestrogen cocktail.

21:30.158 --> 21:33.411
lt's usually prescribed for women
whose systems can't handle the pill.

21:33.578 --> 21:37.457
- The pill is the most common--
- l've had a few wives, Abby.

21:37.623 --> 21:40.585
And yet you know
so little about women.

21:41.377 --> 21:43.713
Luckily, this patch was still
in the rollout phase,

21:43.963 --> 21:46.966
so the company is required
to maintain detailed medical profiles

21:47.133 --> 21:48.676
on the 3,000 women
that are using them.

21:49.218 --> 21:51.095
l crossed those profiles

21:51.262 --> 21:54.390
with the data l pulled off her DNA
profile, her race and her blood type.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.642
l came up with 200 women, Gibbs.

21:56.809 --> 22:00.396
- Find out which one's missing.
- l'm not done yet.

22:01.647 --> 22:04.984
From the hair samples, we know
that the woman was brunette.

22:05.151 --> 22:09.280
So if we subtract blond women
and those with black hair,

22:09.447 --> 22:11.240
that brings us to 43.

22:12.408 --> 22:15.161
Of the 43, only 1 4 live
in the Mid-Atlantic.

22:15.328 --> 22:17.789
l called them all, and l got 1 3.

22:17.955 --> 22:19.123
Number 1 4...

22:20.833 --> 22:23.586
...is Jessica Fagan.
She works at HUD in D.C.

22:23.753 --> 22:26.339
She didn't show up for work
on Monday. She's missing, Gibbs.

22:26.506 --> 22:28.383
- Got a picture?
- l was waiting for the DMV

22:28.549 --> 22:32.303
to email me one before l called you.
But fortunately, it's already here.

22:33.471 --> 22:35.848
Boss, this definitely
doesn't look like a coincidence.

22:36.015 --> 22:38.142
You think, McGee?

22:40.478 --> 22:41.729
lt's confirmed, boss.

22:41.896 --> 22:43.606
She told a co-worker
she was going camping

22:43.773 --> 22:45.191
with her boyfriend in Shenandoah.

22:45.358 --> 22:49.070
Duck, all three of these women's
deaths were ruled accidental.

22:49.237 --> 22:51.781
Pull their autopsy records, along
with the guys who died with them.

22:51.948 --> 22:53.825
To look for what, specifically?

22:54.701 --> 22:57.036
- How they were murdered.
- Oh, right.

22:59.038 --> 23:01.874
- Nice place you got here, Ziva.
- Thanks.

23:02.041 --> 23:04.961
They cut our wildlife conservation
budget, and you guys have a skylight?

23:05.128 --> 23:06.713
- Nice.
- l understand things

23:06.879 --> 23:08.798
have taken a turn
for the worse, Agent Gibbs?

23:08.965 --> 23:12.468
lf by ''worse'' you mean multiple
homicides in your park since 2000,

23:12.677 --> 23:14.178
then yeah, worse.

23:14.345 --> 23:17.181
- Well, there goes that theory.
- What theory?

23:17.348 --> 23:20.560
l was prepared to say that
this could all be just a coincidence,

23:20.727 --> 23:23.980
- but when you see them like that--
- lt's more than a little disturbing.

23:24.147 --> 23:26.941
Yeah. What can we do to help?

23:27.233 --> 23:30.653
We're looking for someone who knows
his way around your park. Like a local.

23:30.820 --> 23:34.574
We've got a list of the usual
troublemakers, poachers and vandals.

23:34.741 --> 23:37.243
But l never figured any of them
for a serial killer.

23:37.410 --> 23:39.370
Most likely you wouldn't, James.

23:39.537 --> 23:41.873
The successful ones
blend into their environment.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.167
Yeah. l mean,
look at the BTK killer, right?

23:44.333 --> 23:48.087
Pillar of the community, Cub Scout
leader, president of his church.

23:48.296 --> 23:51.174
- You're saying it could be anyone?
- Not in this case.

23:51.340 --> 23:53.718
We're looking for someone who
carried a woman through the woods

23:53.885 --> 23:55.261
and hardly left a track.

23:55.428 --> 23:58.347
- An experienced hunter?
- Or someone with military training.

23:58.514 --> 24:01.350
l'd like to send the photo of the missing
woman to our search teams.

24:01.517 --> 24:02.769
- DiNozzo.
- l'm on it.

24:02.935 --> 24:04.437
Get it to Pete at Jackrabbit Slim's.

24:04.604 --> 24:07.940
Tell him to post it on every pole,
every fence, every car near the park.

24:08.107 --> 24:09.859
<i>- Gibbs.
- Got something if you're interested.</i>

24:10.026 --> 24:13.071
Yeah, we're on our way.
Abby's got something.

24:13.363 --> 24:15.698
Our forensic scientist.
You'll like her.

24:15.865 --> 24:17.241
She's a vampire.

24:18.284 --> 24:21.454
So would you like me
to email that or fax it?

24:21.788 --> 24:23.081
Email is fine.

24:23.831 --> 24:25.208
Email it is.

24:26.292 --> 24:30.505
So is it just me
or is it hot in here?

24:33.549 --> 24:35.134
lt's probably a little bit of both.

24:36.469 --> 24:38.763
Email sent. There you go.

24:38.930 --> 24:41.641
So l was thinking
about this weekend and...

24:43.476 --> 24:45.978
About trying camping?

24:49.399 --> 24:51.818
- ls something wrong?
- l'm married.

24:53.194 --> 24:55.988
- Then why'd you ask for my number?
- She's dead.

24:57.824 --> 25:02.954
lt was a-- lt was a pottery accident.
Kiln overheated or something.

25:03.121 --> 25:06.332
Very unexpected. Very unexpected.

25:06.999 --> 25:08.918
l thought l was ready to move on.

25:11.421 --> 25:13.297
Oh, you.

25:13.464 --> 25:16.592
Oh, you poor, poor man.

25:26.144 --> 25:28.604
l swabbed what's left
of Petty Officer Riley's clothes.

25:28.855 --> 25:32.817
lt's mostly his blood and what
l now know to be bear saliva.

25:32.984 --> 25:35.194
He was eaten by a bear.
Tell me something l don't know.

25:35.361 --> 25:37.280
About the case
or something more personal?

25:37.488 --> 25:39.032
Abby.

25:39.240 --> 25:42.076
l also found traces
of a cornucopia of different chemicals

25:42.243 --> 25:44.704
sprayed all over his clothes.
Phenylacetic crystals,

25:44.871 --> 25:47.623
methyl anthranilate and acorn,
caramel and bergamot oils.

25:47.790 --> 25:50.668
- A hunting lure?
- You are correct, Mr. Ranger, sir.

25:50.835 --> 25:53.838
More specifically,
it was Uncle Bebo's Bear Attractant.

25:54.005 --> 25:55.715
Somebody hosed
the officer down with it.

25:55.882 --> 25:57.216
l can pull a list of every hunter

25:57.383 --> 26:00.136
that applied for
a bear-hunting permit this year.

26:00.303 --> 26:03.097
You don't have to. McGee just found
who sprayed him with it.

26:03.347 --> 26:06.768
Boss, we pulled multiple prints
from the equipment at the campsite.

26:06.976 --> 26:09.062
Most of them are Riley's.
A bunch, l assume, are--

26:09.228 --> 26:10.646
You assume, McGee?

26:10.813 --> 26:14.442
Well, l meant we're working on getting
Jessica Fagan's prints to clear them,

26:14.650 --> 26:16.861
but we have three other matches

26:17.028 --> 26:18.571
belonging to a third individual.

26:21.574 --> 26:22.617
Jason Edom.

26:22.784 --> 26:24.577
Looks like he was baiting
more than bears.

26:39.217 --> 26:42.345
This man makes my skin crawl.

26:42.512 --> 26:44.931
Can you interrogate him
without breaking bones?

26:45.973 --> 26:48.226
Truthfully? No.

26:48.393 --> 26:51.437
l agree. That's why l'm doing it.

26:51.687 --> 26:53.439
You're gonna spend
the next few hours

26:53.606 --> 26:55.942
studying everything we know
about him and the evidence.

26:56.109 --> 26:57.777
And supply the answers
to you in there?

26:57.944 --> 27:00.279
No. No, l've got DiNozzo
doing that.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.325
You're on Edom's side.

27:04.534 --> 27:07.412
- Meaning?
- Meaning,

27:07.620 --> 27:11.290
you're going to defend him. l want you
to assume that he's innocent.

27:11.666 --> 27:15.586
- The man's a serial-killing racist.
- He probably is.

27:15.795 --> 27:17.714
- But you're still gonna do it.
- Why?

27:17.880 --> 27:21.551
Because you can't walk in there
and interrogate him.

27:22.051 --> 27:23.636
Yet.

27:39.986 --> 27:42.071
You mind telling me why l'm here?

27:43.906 --> 27:46.325
You like hunting.

27:46.492 --> 27:49.078
Last time l checked,
that wasn't illegal.

27:49.328 --> 27:51.664
Your hunting license was pulled.

27:55.251 --> 27:57.420
You're a Marine, huh?

27:58.171 --> 27:59.797
l can tell.

28:00.006 --> 28:01.507
My old man was a Marine.

28:02.341 --> 28:04.761
Hated his guts.

28:04.969 --> 28:06.929
''Get your hands
out of your pockets, boy.

28:07.138 --> 28:10.308
Shave your face, boy.
Cut your hair, boy.''

28:11.142 --> 28:12.810
See?

28:13.019 --> 28:14.604
A lasting impression.

28:15.313 --> 28:17.023
Semper fi.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.819
He teach you how to bait bears?

28:22.570 --> 28:27.450
No, l learned that for myself.
He was just a real loser.

28:27.742 --> 28:30.370
Your record includes
more than bear baiting.

28:30.536 --> 28:32.455
l guess l'm a complicated man.

28:32.663 --> 28:35.208
You did time for assault and battery.

28:35.375 --> 28:37.543
lt was a bar fight.
l didn't even start it.

28:40.338 --> 28:42.382
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.

28:44.175 --> 28:46.552
That's the idiot
who got eaten by the bear.

28:46.928 --> 28:50.390
He was murdered first
with a hunting knife.

28:51.307 --> 28:53.393
You baited the area
where that occurred.

28:53.559 --> 28:55.228
Lookie here, Mr. Marine.

28:55.395 --> 28:57.480
l haven't been in that park
for over a month.

28:57.647 --> 29:01.359
News flash.
l happen to be banned for life.

29:01.567 --> 29:03.444
Your fingerprints
were found at the campsite.

29:03.653 --> 29:05.488
Last time l checked,
that was inside the park.

29:05.655 --> 29:07.240
No, that's a damn lie.

29:07.448 --> 29:09.283
l ain't been nowhere near that area.

29:12.495 --> 29:13.871
Know her?

29:14.622 --> 29:16.082
Nope.

29:19.711 --> 29:21.045
How about them?

29:21.295 --> 29:23.673
Like l said, no.

29:23.965 --> 29:25.425
Okay?

29:25.591 --> 29:28.094
l didn't have nothing to do with this.
l wouldn't...

29:29.929 --> 29:31.764
Wouldn't what?

29:31.931 --> 29:33.349
Kill people.

29:33.641 --> 29:35.059
l may be a lot of things,

29:35.226 --> 29:39.814
but l'm not some psycho.

29:41.774 --> 29:44.193
- Yes, l'll hold.
- You shave, right?

29:45.236 --> 29:47.030
- What?
- Nothing.

29:48.114 --> 29:50.241
So how'd the killer's prints
end up at the campsite?

29:50.408 --> 29:52.952
Obviously when he murdered the sailor
and abducted the girl.

29:54.787 --> 29:57.957
No, Gibbs wants you
defending him, Ziva.

29:58.124 --> 30:01.210
McGee, what objects
were the killer--

30:01.037 --> 30:03.957
Sorry, sorry. Edom, Edom.
--Edom's prints found on again?

30:04.124 --> 30:07.293
Two cans of tuna,
one pack of AA batteries.

30:07.919 --> 30:10.255
All items sold at Jackrabbit Slim's.

30:10.922 --> 30:14.426
Okay, so, what if Riley
bought these items

30:14.634 --> 30:16.052
and Edom placed them in a bag?

30:17.137 --> 30:20.140
Yeah. That one's actually plausible.

30:20.932 --> 30:22.809
Nice job. But it is hard to prove.

30:22.976 --> 30:25.812
- l'm still here, yes.
- Okay, Edom's a hunter, right?

30:25.979 --> 30:27.313
He's familiar with the area

30:27.480 --> 30:30.108
- and he's done time for violent crime.
- Thank you.

30:30.316 --> 30:32.610
And we found his prints
at the campsite, so--

30:32.777 --> 30:34.988
- He didn't do it.
- Okay, you're not getting this.

30:35.155 --> 30:37.866
- You can't just say he didn't do it.
- Ziva, he's right.

30:38.033 --> 30:41.077
You need to back your side up
with facts and rational--

30:41.244 --> 30:42.495
The night Riley was murdered,

30:42.704 --> 30:45.498
Edom was at his daughter's
dance recital in Manassas, Virginia.

30:45.665 --> 30:47.000
Multiple witnesses.

30:49.419 --> 30:50.879
- Unbelievable.
- l agree.

30:51.046 --> 30:52.839
l thought for sure this was our man.

30:53.006 --> 30:55.258
No. l mean, this guy
actually reproduced?

30:55.425 --> 30:57.677
- Gibbs, we just--
- Confirmed Edom's alibi.

30:57.844 --> 31:00.013
He was in Manassas
the night of the murder.

31:00.221 --> 31:02.182
- He didn't do it.
- l know.

31:02.349 --> 31:04.809
- He knows.
- So, what now?

31:04.976 --> 31:06.853
You're gonna go
and have a talk with him.

31:07.020 --> 31:09.856
Why? You just agreed
he didn't kill the petty officer.

31:12.692 --> 31:15.528
Because he knows who did.

31:35.882 --> 31:37.258
lt's not poisoned.

31:51.398 --> 31:53.316
Afraid of germs?

32:00.281 --> 32:02.242
l didn't kill those women.

32:02.701 --> 32:03.952
l know.

32:06.705 --> 32:08.748
You were at your daughter's
dance recital.

32:12.711 --> 32:14.504
You know...

32:17.924 --> 32:22.011
...l used to spend
most of my time on stage...

32:23.263 --> 32:27.183
...searching for my father's face
in the audience.

32:30.395 --> 32:32.355
But he was never there.

32:34.858 --> 32:37.360
Even when he promised he'd...

32:42.574 --> 32:47.871
l drove all the way
to South Carolina once.

32:49.205 --> 32:51.583
To watch your daughter dance?

32:51.791 --> 32:53.460
What's her name?

32:54.586 --> 32:56.129
Sarah.

33:02.177 --> 33:04.471
That's a Hebrew name.

33:08.224 --> 33:10.268
lt means ''princess.''

33:13.229 --> 33:15.440
l didn't know that.

33:33.833 --> 33:38.463
Each of them was
someone's princess, Jason.

33:55.063 --> 33:57.899
She should have never left him.

33:59.067 --> 34:00.610
Not like she did.

34:01.695 --> 34:03.530
Left who?

34:13.540 --> 34:14.998
Wes.

34:18.085 --> 34:19.920
Boss, state troopers
just missed Wes Rowan.

34:20.088 --> 34:22.632
He left Jackrabbit Slim's
with a rifle and a backpack.

34:22.799 --> 34:25.217
- Said he was gonna help search.
- He is the search, McGee.

34:26.136 --> 34:29.054
Jessica Fagan was
Wes Rowan's childhood sweetheart.

34:29.222 --> 34:32.559
lt was over when she filed a restraining
order against him in 2000.

34:32.726 --> 34:34.310
Why am l finding out
about this now?

34:34.518 --> 34:36.228
She changed her name.
lt used to be Parker.

34:36.396 --> 34:39.065
Most likely to make it difficult
for Rowan to locate her.

34:39.232 --> 34:42.027
When he couldn't, he took his anger
out on women who resembled her.

34:42.235 --> 34:44.571
Explains why she never
let anyone at Jackrabbit Slim's

34:44.737 --> 34:47.657
- or the park see her.
- Oh, you think, DiNozzo? Gibbs.

34:48.241 --> 34:51.244
<i>- Abs, l have no time. Two minutes.
- lt's really important.</i>

34:51.411 --> 34:54.246
Boss, state troopers are setting up
roadblocks on all highways

34:54.414 --> 34:57.125
- leading down from the mountains.
- He took his backpack with him.

34:57.292 --> 34:58.710
He's not planning on coming down.

34:58.877 --> 35:00.837
Grab your gear.
l'll meet you out back in five.

35:01.254 --> 35:03.256
Guess what, guys?
Rowan is a hunting guide,

35:03.423 --> 35:05.425
- apparently one of the best in Virginia.
- Great.

35:05.592 --> 35:07.469
He'll be like finding
a pin in a haystack.

35:07.677 --> 35:08.762
A needle in a haystack.

35:08.928 --> 35:11.097
Well, aren't pins
just as hard to find?

35:11.264 --> 35:12.515
- No.
- No.

35:17.812 --> 35:19.606
You've got two minutes, Abby.
Starting now.

35:19.773 --> 35:22.359
l don't need two minutes. Just
a minute or maybe 45 seconds.

35:22.525 --> 35:24.986
- Abby.
- l pulled skin cells off the rhinestones

35:25.153 --> 35:27.781
that you found in the park, and the
DNA matches Fagan's hair.

35:27.947 --> 35:31.409
- You could've told me on the phone.
- Well, l also found traces of blood.

35:31.826 --> 35:33.203
l have a theory, Gibbs.

35:34.245 --> 35:35.455
l made this in high school.

35:37.082 --> 35:39.209
- Minute, 33.
- Okay. l screwed up a bunch of times.

35:39.376 --> 35:43.296
Pulling these things off is really hard.
l cracked two nails and l cut my finger.

35:43.463 --> 35:46.299
Oh, hell, she's leaving a trail.
That's great work, Abs.

35:46.466 --> 35:48.802
Wait, l still have
a minute and change left.

35:50.011 --> 35:53.390
l know you're really busy with the case,
and l understand.

35:53.556 --> 35:56.643
- Understand what?
- That you forgot my birthday.

35:56.810 --> 35:59.604
- l didn't forget.
- You didn't?

35:59.771 --> 36:01.981
No. l remember how old you are too.

36:02.148 --> 36:03.441
Oh, you can forget that.

36:04.567 --> 36:05.985
Check your desk.

36:06.152 --> 36:07.320
No.

36:07.487 --> 36:09.280
l have been working in here all night.

36:09.447 --> 36:12.158
There is no way you snuck by me.

36:27.298 --> 36:29.384
<i>This is so Pulp Fiction.</i>

36:29.551 --> 36:31.594
l've been searching
the building for you.

36:31.803 --> 36:33.805
- You found me.
- She may be still alive, Jethro.

36:33.972 --> 36:37.017
l re-checked the
Rappahannock County ME's records.

36:37.183 --> 36:39.477
All three victims
had hairline fractures.

36:39.686 --> 36:42.355
The medical examiners assumed
that these were caused by animals

36:42.522 --> 36:45.191
- or falls in the woods.
- They didn't know she was murdered.

36:45.358 --> 36:47.193
- That bastard beats them.
- l'm afraid so.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.653
How does that make her alive?

36:48.862 --> 36:51.364
Some of the fractures
had minute calcification.

36:51.531 --> 36:52.949
They'd begun to heal, Jethro.

36:53.116 --> 36:55.535
- How long?
- Well, l'd say a week or 1 0 days

36:55.702 --> 36:57.537
perhaps after he beat them.

36:59.372 --> 37:00.957
He'll find you, my dear,

37:01.666 --> 37:04.878
hopefully before it's too late.

37:06.004 --> 37:09.507
There are hunting cabins along this
edge. He could have taken her to one.

37:09.716 --> 37:11.217
- Any cabins in the park?
- Two.

37:11.384 --> 37:14.554
Birch and Pine. Gotta reserve them a
year in advance. They're real popular.

37:14.721 --> 37:16.389
- ls anyone there now?
- No.

37:16.556 --> 37:18.224
We open them Memorial Day
to Labour Day.

37:18.433 --> 37:20.852
- Where?
- Pine's here. Birch is here.

37:21.061 --> 37:22.979
The other night,
l lost the trail around here.

37:23.188 --> 37:24.564
Jessica could be in those cabins.

37:24.731 --> 37:26.024
Checked them the first day.

37:26.191 --> 37:28.777
What if he held her in the woods
while you searched the cabin?

37:28.943 --> 37:30.028
Search them again.

37:30.195 --> 37:31.905
Where's Ranger Landis
and his search party?

37:32.197 --> 37:34.407
- Razorback Ridge.
- He's a lot closer than we are.

37:34.574 --> 37:37.077
Have him search them. McGee!
DiNozzo, you're with me.

37:37.243 --> 37:38.703
Ziva, stay
with Ranger Hendricks.

37:38.870 --> 37:43.458
- l'd be better suited if l actually went--
- We're taking him alive. Let's roll.

37:44.876 --> 37:47.295
l hate it when men try to protect you
because you're female.

37:47.462 --> 37:48.880
He's not trying to protect me.

37:49.089 --> 37:52.092
He's afraid l'll kill Rowan
before he tells us where the girl is.

38:01.768 --> 38:03.937
For a ghost,
he's sure leaving a lot of footprints.

38:15.198 --> 38:17.784
- He took a knee here.
- Maybe he heard McGee coming.

38:19.119 --> 38:20.870
No.

38:21.037 --> 38:22.789
He's tracking.

38:23.915 --> 38:26.710
Tracking who?
He already knows where the girl is.

38:32.632 --> 38:35.802
James? Bobby. How you doing?

38:35.969 --> 38:39.264
<i>Almost to Pine Cabin. l've got
Beaufort and Max checking Birch.</i>

38:39.472 --> 38:42.475
<i>- You be careful, you hear?
- Don't worry about me, Bobby. Out.</i>

38:43.143 --> 38:45.562
- You both live here?
- Jim does.

38:45.812 --> 38:47.731
l got me a log cabin
about a mile down the road.

38:48.273 --> 38:49.649
Built in the 1 830s.

38:50.567 --> 38:53.278
- ls that old?
- Yeah, around these parts it is.

38:53.611 --> 38:57.532
l'm sorry, that was bitchy.
l get that way when l'm tired.

38:58.158 --> 39:00.035
Yeah. Me too.

39:00.660 --> 39:01.870
That'll be more searchers.

39:02.037 --> 39:03.538
l better go brief them.

39:03.705 --> 39:05.790
Do you mind if l grab a bat nap?

39:05.957 --> 39:09.669
No. Just hang from the rafters.

39:18.261 --> 39:20.055
What is it, boss?

39:21.306 --> 39:22.807
The trail's too obvious.

39:24.809 --> 39:27.020
Rowan doesn't know
that we're tracking him.

39:27.187 --> 39:28.855
Or he's setting an ambush.

39:30.023 --> 39:33.318
McGee, l want you 30 meters
to my right.

39:33.651 --> 39:36.613
DiNozzo, 30 to my left.

39:37.572 --> 39:39.032
l'll stay on this trail.

39:40.325 --> 39:41.659
What if it is an ambush?

39:42.452 --> 39:44.537
l want you guys to get him
before he gets me.

39:45.372 --> 39:48.708
Go. Go. Be ghosts.

41:10.874 --> 41:12.333
l got him.

41:18.048 --> 41:20.467
- l thought it was you, boss.
- Me too.

41:22.802 --> 41:25.472
l was trying to find Jessica.

41:31.561 --> 41:34.397
- We gotta get him to a hospital.
- Let the bastard bleed to death.

41:34.814 --> 41:38.193
He dies,
we may never find that girl alive.

41:54.292 --> 41:55.668
Your station can't be far.

41:55.835 --> 41:57.462
Maybe a quarter of a mile that way.

41:58.797 --> 42:00.465
- You got him?
- Come on.

42:11.518 --> 42:14.145
- Jim made it in. They got Rowan.
- Call 91 1 .

42:14.312 --> 42:17.524
l just did for Rowan. They're bringing
him in wounded. How?

42:17.691 --> 42:20.527
You tell me.
She was in your root cellar.

42:24.197 --> 42:25.699
l thought you were leading
the search.

42:25.949 --> 42:27.951
Bobby radioed
she had fresh searchers.

42:28.118 --> 42:29.536
l was cutting back to pick them up

42:29.744 --> 42:32.372
and l spotted Rowan
sneaking through the woods.

42:33.164 --> 42:35.208
He wasn't sneaking,
he was tracking.

42:35.458 --> 42:38.545
<i>Jim, this is Bobby.
Officer David found Jessica Fagan.</i>

42:39.045 --> 42:40.338
<i>She was in your root cellar.</i>

42:41.548 --> 42:44.008
<i>- Jim? Jim, do you read me?
- Drop that shotgun.</i>

42:44.175 --> 42:48.346
<i>- Jim, are you there?
- How many?</i>

42:49.055 --> 42:51.016
Twenty-seven.

42:51.182 --> 42:52.892
No, 26.

42:53.101 --> 42:55.311
Can't count Jessica.

42:55.687 --> 42:57.731
l didn't finish with her.

42:58.231 --> 42:59.566
Now, drop that shotgun!

43:01.359 --> 43:02.861
- Take him.
- No. What are you doing?

43:03.028 --> 43:05.363
- l'm gonna go help boss.
- Doesn't need you. Look at him.

43:25.800 --> 43:30.096
- Boss didn't--?
- No. He wouldn't do a thing like that.
