01:39.396 --> 01:42.699
Launch control is having trouble
verifying mass acceleration.

01:42.833 --> 01:47.037
Team Banzai rotational supervisor,
please confirm.

01:48.505 --> 01:52.642
I want an electromagnetic
fuel reading from the launch.

01:54.477 --> 01:59.082
We are T minus seven zero and holding.

01:59.215 --> 02:03.353
Antigravity inertia reversal crosscheck.

02:05.421 --> 02:08.390
Can we have a photographic
printout to the bunker?

02:08.524 --> 02:13.896
T minus six zero three and holding.
Phaser positive. Latch compressor.

02:14.397 --> 02:18.267
Multistage
axial compressor... latched.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.605
Fuel pressure... 1800 torrs.

02:22.738 --> 02:28.577
Commence pullback to
the launch sequence. Clear the launch.

02:31.246 --> 02:34.383
Specific density is 2.5. Over.

02:34.516 --> 02:37.786
You're kidding. He's still at the hospital?

02:38.954 --> 02:41.489
Banzai hasn't showed yet, Mr Secretary.

02:41.623 --> 02:44.459
Looks like he's got cold feet.

02:44.592 --> 02:48.163
Well, better go see what's
keeping the boss, Reno.

02:48.296 --> 02:50.765
Why me?

02:50.899 --> 02:52.634
Cos I'm busy.

02:54.535 --> 02:56.337
May I have the curved Yasargil, please?

02:56.471 --> 02:58.806
It's not here, Dr Banzai.

02:58.940 --> 03:01.442
Ah, let me have the straight one then.

03:01.576 --> 03:03.844
See, this is the part where for me
it started looking like a problem.

03:03.978 --> 03:08.249
I mean, I wanted to sacrifice the precentral
vein in order to get some exposure.

03:08.382 --> 03:11.685
But because of this guy's normal variation,
I got excited and all the sudden I didn't know

03:11.819 --> 03:15.456
whether I was looking at the precentral vein or one
of the internal cerebro veins or the Vein of Galen

03:15.589 --> 03:19.660
or the Basilar vein of Rosenthal, so one my own me at
this point I was ready to say "That's it, let's get out".

03:19.793 --> 03:22.863
See, you can check
your anatomy all you want,

03:22.996 --> 03:25.665
and even though there may be normal
variation, if you get right down to it,

03:25.799 --> 03:28.635
this far inside the head,
it all looks the same.

03:28.768 --> 03:31.838
No, no, no. Don't tug on that.
You never know what it might be attached to.

03:35.508 --> 03:38.845
This is control.
02 vents are closed. Looks good.

03:39.345 --> 03:42.815
Dr Banzai is using the laser
to vaporise a pineal tumour

03:42.949 --> 03:45.618
without damaging
the quadrigeminal plate.

03:45.752 --> 03:48.654
Subcutaneous microphone gonna
allow the patient to transmit

03:48.788 --> 03:51.324
verbal instructions to his own brain.

03:51.457 --> 03:56.195
- Like "Raise my left arm"?
- Or "Throw the harpoon".

03:56.328 --> 03:59.365
People are gonna come from all over.
This boy's an Eskimo.

04:00.299 --> 04:03.636
You ever thought about
joining me full time?

04:03.769 --> 04:05.838
What do you mean? You serious?
Do you have an opening?

04:05.971 --> 04:09.842
Uh-huh. Can you sing?

04:09.975 --> 04:12.744
A little. Yeah. I can dance.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.379
Hey, it's Buckaroo.

04:14.513 --> 04:17.582
We have Buckaroo descending.
We have him on the launch parameter.

04:17.716 --> 04:23.555
Inertial control positive.
T minus five four five. Resume counting.

04:23.688 --> 04:25.357
Hey, hey, Rawhide!

04:25.490 --> 04:29.494
All systems righteous.
Professor Hikita says we have a go.

04:39.670 --> 04:44.408
I'm teeing off in an hour and a half.
What's this jalopy supposed to do anyway?

04:44.542 --> 04:48.245
- 500 miles an hour, General.
- Oh, Senator, you're so gullible.

04:53.350 --> 04:57.821
Please clear the launch grid.
Please clear the launch grid.

05:01.592 --> 05:05.062
HB 88, this is control.
Driver's door check secure.

05:05.429 --> 05:09.132
...B, C, D, E...
- Clear the area!

05:11.735 --> 05:15.305
Control, this is HB 88.
Commander's voice check. Over.

05:15.438 --> 05:17.674
Roger, HB 88. Read you. Out.

05:17.841 --> 05:21.578
Control, this is HB 88.
Event timer started. Over.

05:21.711 --> 05:25.248
HB 88, this is control.
APU start is go.

05:25.381 --> 05:27.784
You are on your
on-board computer. Over.

05:27.917 --> 05:29.285
Roger, I copy.

05:29.418 --> 05:34.390
- Altimeters? Compasses?
- Set and crosschecked.

05:36.659 --> 05:39.528
- Reserve brake system two?
- Closed and guarded.

05:39.695 --> 05:41.430
- Gear handle?
- Down and in.

05:41.564 --> 05:43.799
- Throttles and start levers?
- Closed, off.

05:43.932 --> 05:47.302
- Number four electric hydraulic pump and press?
- On and checked.

05:47.436 --> 05:49.238
- Parking brake?
- Set. Press checked.

05:49.338 --> 05:52.808
- Radios, radar and transponder?
- Set and stand by.

05:58.647 --> 06:02.584
HB 88, this is control.
IMU alignment in progress.

06:02.684 --> 06:05.453
We show 28 degrees, 36 minutes.

06:05.587 --> 06:11.092
30.32 seconds north...
by 80 degrees, 36 minutes.

06:11.192 --> 06:15.063
- 14.8 seconds west.
- Synchro is aligned.

06:15.196 --> 06:19.200
HB 88, this is control.
Ground crew secure. Over.

06:44.825 --> 06:48.995
- INS ram coordinates.
- Form one, fuel ticket?

06:49.129 --> 06:52.198
- On board.
- Circuit breakers?

06:52.332 --> 06:55.935
Point of no return. Five, four, three...

06:56.069 --> 06:59.205
- We have main engine start.
...two, one.

07:09.849 --> 07:12.318
Electronuclear carburation seems fine.

07:14.020 --> 07:19.925
He's fast. I'll give Banzai that. But one
heat-seeking missile and he's history.

07:20.059 --> 07:23.696
This is control. APU start is go.

07:23.829 --> 07:27.599
You're on your on-board computer. Over.

07:27.733 --> 07:32.471
They are reading you on the localiser
downrange. Looks good. Over.

07:32.604 --> 07:34.706
HB 88, this is control.

07:34.840 --> 07:39.477
Speed steady at 317 nautical.
400 and accelerating!

07:41.546 --> 07:44.983
Horizontal velocity is expanding. Over.

07:48.953 --> 07:51.556
- Four... three...
- Here he comes.

07:51.689 --> 07:54.592
...two... one.

07:54.726 --> 07:57.395
- Where's he going?
- Yeah!

07:59.363 --> 08:02.300
He is off course.
This is Chase One. Over.

08:02.433 --> 08:04.235
He has broken trajectory...

08:04.368 --> 08:08.472
50 cylinder. There is an immediate
fire hazard. Do you read?

08:08.606 --> 08:10.574
- Roger.
- Do you read?

08:10.708 --> 08:14.611
Advise you abort. Over.
Repeat: Advise you cancel phase two!

08:14.745 --> 08:18.482
- What the hell's phase two?
- That's a big no-can-do.

08:21.985 --> 08:25.455
Buckaroo, are you decompressing? Over.

08:26.289 --> 08:29.459
- He's broken the sound barrier!
- Mach 1.3.

08:29.593 --> 08:33.929
Buckaroo, do you read?
Commence braking procedure. Over.

08:34.063 --> 08:36.466
Just be cool. She'll hold.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.703
Axis negative.
Pneumatic pressure negative.

08:40.837 --> 08:43.172
We are looking at 500 degrees...

08:43.306 --> 08:47.009
We are in pursuit.
He is gaining. Over.

08:47.143 --> 08:49.545
He's headed for the mountains!

08:49.679 --> 08:51.280
Eject, Buckaroo! Eject!

08:53.616 --> 08:59.021
HB 88, do you read? Do you read? Over.
This is control. Do you read?

09:00.522 --> 09:02.925
Unsafe levels of...

09:03.759 --> 09:07.396
Standby recirculation has been activated.

09:09.331 --> 09:12.301
HB 88, this is control. Do you...

09:16.605 --> 09:20.242
Hotel Brava 88 do you read?
Do you read? Over.

09:21.142 --> 09:25.547
- What is going on?
- It's off my scope.

09:33.955 --> 09:37.892
This is Chase One. We got his tracks.
They go right up to a wall of rock.

09:38.025 --> 09:39.594
Holy shit!

10:12.292 --> 10:17.430
This is Chase Two. Chase Two.
We see him. We see him.

10:17.931 --> 10:21.267
We have him. Chase Two reports
a visual 100 miles off course.

10:21.401 --> 10:22.302
Banzai!

10:24.771 --> 10:27.573
He's gone through it.
He's gone through the mountain.

10:27.707 --> 10:29.976
It has deployed there.

10:32.044 --> 10:35.881
There is a minimal disturbance
in the electromagnetic field.

10:36.015 --> 10:38.884
Antigravity inertia is normal.

10:39.018 --> 10:42.621
Mass acceleration is diminishing. Over.

10:42.755 --> 10:44.323
He is OK.

10:44.456 --> 10:49.061
The vehicle is hot, but we are
showing no radioactivity. Over.

10:49.194 --> 10:54.099
HB 88, this is control. We see you.
Welcome home. Over.

10:54.232 --> 10:57.636
We show electrical-field aberrations
on the windshield.

10:57.769 --> 11:03.174
We are getting a localised vibration
of the drive train and a minor oil leak.

11:03.308 --> 11:06.244
Buckaroo, can you verify
operational capability?

11:12.617 --> 11:13.985
HB 88, this is control.

11:14.118 --> 11:17.421
We are reading an electrical
field aberration of 993

11:17.555 --> 11:21.626
on your windshield, static and fracture.
Can you confirm? Over.

11:32.269 --> 11:35.606
HB 88, this is control.
Do you hear me? Over.

11:35.739 --> 11:41.712
We are getting localised vibration on
your drive shaft. Can you verify? Over.

11:51.788 --> 11:57.327
HB 88, a retrieval vehicle
will rendezvous in ten minutes. Over.

12:07.804 --> 12:12.108
Well, there it is,
tyre tracks right up to a wall of rock.

12:12.275 --> 12:15.878
Perfect Tommy, Rawhide, Reno -

12:16.011 --> 12:20.983
cute guys of the Hong Kong Cavaliers,
Buckaroo's most trusted inner circle.

12:21.917 --> 12:25.888
Could you elaborate on that device,
I believe, dubbed the "oscillator"...

12:26.021 --> 12:29.525
- Oscillation overthruster.
- Hikita!

12:29.658 --> 12:33.595
- Thank you, Allison.
- That dirty little Asian critter!

12:37.666 --> 12:43.071
Tranquillisers are being dispensed
to all patients between 10 and 11 am,

12:43.204 --> 12:46.708
Tuesday, Friday and Wednesday.

12:54.349 --> 12:58.452
The sound barrier crumbles,
and then the dimension barrier.

12:58.586 --> 13:05.059
It was, Buckaroo Banzai said, exactly like
Professor Hikita had glimpsed in 1938

13:05.192 --> 13:10.864
through the overthruster he and Dr Emilio
Lizardo put together from spare parts

13:10.998 --> 13:13.300
in a laboratory at Princeton.

13:13.434 --> 13:18.438
1938. Can you imagine what it
must have been like then?

13:30.050 --> 13:32.485
Molto grazie, Dr Lizardo.

13:33.153 --> 13:37.490
Almost ready, Dr Lizardo! Almost.

13:59.178 --> 14:02.481
Electromagnets, they are charging.

14:02.615 --> 14:05.317
Catapult, she's wired!

14:06.151 --> 14:09.922
No. Not yet. No!

14:11.089 --> 14:12.557
Whoo!

14:13.592 --> 14:16.128
No, not yet! Not yet! I'm not ready!

14:37.181 --> 14:40.451
- He did not go through the wall.

14:46.824 --> 14:48.926
Holy Toledo!

14:53.797 --> 14:56.633
Facile. Sotto, dottor.

15:07.477 --> 15:09.279
Emilio?

15:29.065 --> 15:31.834
...asked what he saw,
asked where he went,

15:31.934 --> 15:37.473
Dr Banzai replied "Vast chasms
of hissing swamp, spurts of flame,

15:37.606 --> 15:41.076
huge thunderclaps
and gurgling rock formations."

15:42.177 --> 15:46.615
Lithium is no longer
available on credit.

15:50.552 --> 15:53.155
G-sub-E...

15:53.288 --> 15:58.226
Gesù Cristo, make the ganglia twitch.
We're home free.

15:58.360 --> 16:04.299
Home... home is where
you wear your hat.

16:04.432 --> 16:08.770
I feel so break up, I want to go home!

16:08.903 --> 16:13.308
Hello, Doc. Who are we today?
Albert Einstein?

16:13.441 --> 16:16.444
No. Lord John Whorfin.

16:16.577 --> 16:20.448
If there's one thing I hate,
it's to be mistaken for somebody else.

16:20.581 --> 16:25.720
Cheer up, Lizardo. It's Friday. I got
a care package from your yo-yo friends.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.456
Hey, Signore...

16:29.590 --> 16:31.859
grazie tanto.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.961
Thanks, Doc.

16:34.094 --> 16:37.264
I come for your TV.
You've been using too much juice.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.400
Another 10,000 kilowatts
again this month.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.670
It beats me how an old homicidal
loony can use that much power.

16:43.804 --> 16:46.673
Go on, take it! I don't need it!

16:46.807 --> 16:52.612
Tomorrow I'm goin' home
with my overthruster.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.383
That's terrific, Doc.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.853
I'll make sure you get
an early wake-up call.

17:02.855 --> 17:06.125
Laugh while you can, monkey boy.

17:16.801 --> 17:20.539
Buckaroo, I've done
a spectrographic analysis

17:20.673 --> 17:24.843
on the specimen you pulled
off the jet car drive shaft.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.746
Rawhide, what do you think?

17:27.880 --> 17:30.082
I don't care if you walked
through a mountain in Texas.

17:30.215 --> 17:35.053
This is New Jersey, and when you
play my joint, you're just another act.

17:35.187 --> 17:40.058
- I want some music out of you.
- You want it, Artie? You got it.

17:44.162 --> 17:45.230
Let's rock and roll!

17:50.268 --> 17:54.505
Ladies and gentlemen, Artie's Artery
is proud to present for a single night only,

17:54.605 --> 17:58.376
New Brunswick's own,
the one, the only, the amazing...

17:58.509 --> 18:02.413
Buckaroo Banzai and
the Hong Kong Cavaliers!

19:13.415 --> 19:15.350
Excuse me.

19:17.219 --> 19:20.522
Excuse me, is someone out there
not having a good time?

19:24.759 --> 19:27.162
Is somebody...

19:27.295 --> 19:29.664
is somebody crying...

19:29.797 --> 19:32.100
out there in the darkness?

19:33.001 --> 19:34.869
Somebody crying?

19:35.002 --> 19:38.406
Over here. I'm sorry.

19:39.574 --> 19:45.413
Um, could we get... could we
get her a mike and a spotlight?

19:45.579 --> 19:48.516
Tommy, could we run her a mike?

19:49.617 --> 19:53.754
- What, are you serious?
- Yeah, run her over a mike.

19:56.657 --> 19:58.992
What's your name?

19:59.126 --> 20:01.228
- Who cares?
- Right.

20:01.361 --> 20:03.764
Well, I care. What's your name?

20:08.602 --> 20:11.204
- Penny.
- Did you say Peggy?

20:12.372 --> 20:15.241
No. My name's Penny. Penny Priddy.

20:17.377 --> 20:20.313
That doesn't matter.
It's not important.

20:20.980 --> 20:26.919
I just... I just sponged up
a little too much Vat 69, that's all.

20:27.987 --> 20:31.324
I'm down to my last nickel
in this lousy town,

20:31.424 --> 20:33.826
and they wouldn't take
my luggage in hock.

20:33.926 --> 20:36.462
I lost my room at the Y this morning.

20:40.566 --> 20:42.601
But it's cool.

20:42.735 --> 20:46.238
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, now.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.707
Don't be mean.

20:48.841 --> 20:53.145
We don't have to be mean,
cos, remember...

20:53.712 --> 20:58.583
no matter where you go...
there you are.

21:16.200 --> 21:21.639
- I'm gonna sing this song for you, Peggy.
- No, Penny! Who cares?

21:27.211 --> 21:34.885
I don't have plans and schemes...

21:34.985 --> 21:37.621
And I...

21:37.754 --> 21:42.659
Don't have hopes and dreams...

21:42.793 --> 21:49.533
I don't have anything...

21:49.666 --> 21:51.434
- This is weird.
- Sure is.

21:51.568 --> 21:56.906
Since I don't have you...

21:58.441 --> 22:01.177
- Yeah, I...
- Who's the girl?

22:01.311 --> 22:06.315
Don't have fond desires...

22:06.449 --> 22:13.956
I don't have happy hours...

22:14.090 --> 22:21.263
I don't have anything...

22:28.003 --> 22:32.541
- Get her outta here now! Let's go!
- Let me go! Let me go, you freaks!

22:32.674 --> 22:36.611
- Wait. Wait a minute. Wait.
- Kill that spot. Kill it!

22:41.216 --> 22:45.920
...festive briefing by the
Banzai Institute. Tomorrow...

22:46.821 --> 22:48.857
Where you think you're going, Doc? The moon?

22:48.990 --> 22:52.360
- No, no. Planet Ten.
- Planet Ten. Why, pray tell?

22:52.493 --> 22:54.495
- Operator?
- Doc, put down the phone.

22:54.629 --> 22:59.400
Operator? I wanna make a call
to a Mr John Bigbooty

22:59.534 --> 23:04.905
at Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems
over in Grover's Mill.

23:05.039 --> 23:08.609
And you tell him that
it's John Whorfin calling.

23:08.742 --> 23:12.112
That's W-H-O-R-F-l-N.
You got that, honey?

23:12.246 --> 23:16.216
- John. J-O-H-N.
- This better be collect, Doc.

23:22.856 --> 23:28.695
Bigbooty? Of course it's me, you fool!
Who do you think?

23:28.829 --> 23:31.264
The time has come, Bigbooty.

23:31.398 --> 23:33.767
Prepare for my return.

23:35.168 --> 23:37.904
Well, haven't you heard?
Don't you watch TV?

23:38.037 --> 23:43.810
Banzai and Hikita have done it.
They have opened the window!

23:44.777 --> 23:49.115
Si. Si. So meet me at the factory.

23:49.248 --> 23:52.318
And get their overthruster.

23:52.451 --> 23:54.420
And Hikita, too.

23:54.553 --> 23:56.856
Sure. Alive.

23:57.022 --> 24:01.627
No, no, don't worry about me.
I'll get my own ride.

24:09.635 --> 24:14.673
Evil will not prevail. That was...

24:17.876 --> 24:20.645
Arrivederci, Jersey.

24:20.779 --> 24:24.015
Goodbye, goodbye to her...

24:30.054 --> 24:33.891
- It's the spittin' image.
- Doesn't look anything like her.

24:34.058 --> 24:35.860
Pictures don't lie.

24:35.993 --> 24:40.164
Hell they don't. Met my first wife that way.

24:40.998 --> 24:45.002
It's Peggy to these eyes. It's the
same nose. It's the same hair.

24:45.136 --> 24:48.005
Plus, Buckaroo has to think so too
or else he wouldn't be ready

24:48.139 --> 24:50.374
to make a fool of himself.

24:55.979 --> 24:59.650
Just hot off the World Watch Wire, Buckaroo.
Thought you'd wanna be notified.

24:59.783 --> 25:02.653
Remember that old Italian pal
of the professor's?

25:02.786 --> 25:04.354
- Emilio Lizardo.
- Yeah.

25:04.488 --> 25:08.558
Last night he kills a guard, breaks out of
Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane.

25:08.692 --> 25:12.329
Ten minutes later, he cops a Maserati
Bora. Totalled it a block away.

25:12.462 --> 25:13.663
Holy moly.

25:13.797 --> 25:17.367
- Maserati Bora.
- Mm-hm. That ain't all.

25:18.034 --> 25:20.270
He's vanished. Thin air.

25:20.436 --> 25:26.142
- Dr Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
- You're thinking of Mr Wizard.

25:26.275 --> 25:29.245
This guy is a
top scientist, dummkopf.

25:29.378 --> 25:34.683
- So was Mr Wizard.
- Dr Emilio Lizardo is a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy.

25:34.817 --> 25:38.854
A vicious psychopath.
Just as soon kill you as go fishin'.

25:43.726 --> 25:45.894
Buckaroo, look at this.

25:46.028 --> 25:50.098
Grossly-abnormal high-altitude
electrostatic disturbance

25:50.232 --> 25:53.602
- moving down over Connecticut.
- From the jet car, do you think?

25:53.735 --> 25:56.705
No, not from the jet car.
Check with NORAD Command.

25:56.838 --> 26:01.876
It could be above-ground atomic testing
in China. Maybe sunspot activity.

26:02.010 --> 26:03.445
Man, that's strange.

26:07.182 --> 26:09.617
Scientists at Strategious Space Command have detected

26:09.751 --> 26:13.755
a mysterious radioactive cloudlike
mass over southern New England.

26:13.888 --> 26:18.192
Sources close to the National Security
Consortium have refused to comment.

26:18.292 --> 26:23.964
Let's get on back to three
great modern country hits in a row.

26:27.101 --> 26:28.235
- Sidney!
- Buckaroo!

26:28.369 --> 26:30.838
- How's the patient?
- Fine, thanks to you.

26:30.971 --> 26:32.940
- But more importantly: Congratulations!
- Thank you.

26:33.073 --> 26:35.609
You drove right through
a mountain the other day.

26:35.743 --> 26:38.645
You did it right after you left me at the operation.
You haven't even said anything about it.

26:38.779 --> 26:40.948
- Didn't mention it.
- Sidney, these are my friends.

26:41.081 --> 26:44.751
This is my colleague Dr Sidney Zwibel, old
medical friend from Columbia P and S.

26:44.885 --> 26:47.120
- Howdy. How you're doing?
- Listen, Sidney, I'm glad you could make it.

26:47.254 --> 26:49.656
Cos it looks like we may need an
extra hand sooner than I thought.

26:49.789 --> 26:51.825
Aha, I see. That's what I was wondering about.

26:51.958 --> 26:55.495
I got your message about rendezvousing
at this address. Barely had time to pack.

26:55.628 --> 26:57.931
- Then I came here...
- I can see that.

26:58.064 --> 27:00.500
I'm gonna snoop around.
Make yourself at home.

27:03.936 --> 27:06.606
You know, I thought we were gonna
rehearse or something.

27:06.939 --> 27:10.509
I'm a big fan of all you guys. I love
the comic books and the records.

27:10.643 --> 27:12.478
I know you. You're Pecos.

27:12.611 --> 27:15.981
- Perfect Tommy.
- Perfect Tommy. I'm sorry.

27:16.115 --> 27:19.618
- You're Pecos.
- Pecos is in Tibet. Name's Reno.

27:19.752 --> 27:22.421
- Reno! It's an honour.
- Where do you hail from, Doc?

27:22.521 --> 27:26.125
- Uh, New Jersey. Fort Lee.
- Where are your spurs at?

27:26.258 --> 27:27.693
Is he making fun of me?

27:30.929 --> 27:33.865
Third cell to the left. Pink dress.

27:33.999 --> 27:35.634
Arigato.

27:47.112 --> 27:51.849
What do you want? Huh?
What are you doin' here?

27:51.983 --> 27:55.219
What are you doing here?

27:55.353 --> 27:58.222
Why don't you just go away
and let me rot?

28:00.825 --> 28:04.161
Who were you really trying
to annihilate last night?

28:05.129 --> 28:08.899
You. Just like the papers all say.

28:11.502 --> 28:13.637
Come over here.

28:15.205 --> 28:17.774
Come on.

28:17.908 --> 28:22.212
Oh, my God! Perfect Tommy!

28:27.818 --> 28:29.286
What do you want from me?

28:31.588 --> 28:36.259
Oh, you remind me of someone
I once knew long ago.

28:40.430 --> 28:42.832
Was she very beautiful?

28:44.367 --> 28:48.404
She was... queen of the Netherlands.

28:48.538 --> 28:50.940
That's a long way
from where I come from.

28:51.073 --> 28:54.577
Wyoming? Cody, Wyoming?

28:55.544 --> 28:58.414
No, I'm from Laramie.

28:58.547 --> 29:01.417
Except that I was born in Cody,
but nobody...

29:02.051 --> 29:04.753
Do you have family?
Back in Cody, I mean?

29:04.887 --> 29:07.089
I don't know.

29:07.222 --> 29:11.226
See, I always felt that there was
another part of me somewhere.

29:11.360 --> 29:13.595
Another part of you?

29:13.729 --> 29:16.164
Somewhere, yeah.

29:17.098 --> 29:19.267
I'm adopted.

29:19.401 --> 29:21.236
Of course!

29:21.369 --> 29:24.539
If it was a snake, it'd have bit me!

29:24.639 --> 29:27.008
- Another you.
- Anything's possible.

29:27.142 --> 29:29.777
- Let her out!
- Hey, me too.

29:29.911 --> 29:33.314
- Let her out?
- Yeah, let her out. I'll be responsible.

29:33.448 --> 29:36.584
- She's a killer!
- No, she's not. And give her your coat.

29:37.251 --> 29:39.220
Why me?

29:39.320 --> 29:41.522
Because you're perfect.

29:43.491 --> 29:45.192
You have a point there.

29:49.330 --> 29:52.966
I'd like to move this thing along.

29:53.100 --> 29:57.805
Perhaps some of you noticed we have
a motorcycle convention rolling in here.

29:57.938 --> 30:00.374
We're a little short of time.

30:00.507 --> 30:04.111
Besides, I don't imagine you
came here to listen to me talk.

30:04.244 --> 30:06.313
You're right.

30:10.283 --> 30:13.720
Without further ado, I'd like
to introduce a young man

30:13.853 --> 30:19.058
who yesterday took our notions
of reality and turned them inside out.

30:19.192 --> 30:23.429
Dr Buckaroo Banzai,
perhaps you can explain yourself.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.168
Ooh.

30:29.635 --> 30:34.173
Secretary, Senator Cunningham...
members of the world press.

30:34.640 --> 30:39.144
30 years ago, almost to this day, my mother and
father, Doctors Sandra and Masado Banzai

30:39.278 --> 30:43.048
gave their lives for what was then
considered to be a very insane notion...

30:43.182 --> 30:47.686
the possibility of contacting alien life.

30:47.820 --> 30:52.557
However, not on another planet. But here.

30:52.691 --> 30:55.994
Maybe right inside this table...

30:56.128 --> 31:00.365
living on a simultaneous plane
of existence with our own.

31:00.865 --> 31:03.501
Perhaps within a mountain.

31:05.403 --> 31:08.840
See this rock? It's solid matter, right?

31:08.973 --> 31:13.878
But the solid parts of this rock - the
neutrons, quarks, protons and electrons -

31:14.012 --> 31:15.513
comprise only about

31:15.646 --> 31:18.482
one quadrillionth of its total volume.

31:18.583 --> 31:20.785
- How many zeros is that?
- Quite a few.

31:21.719 --> 31:24.288
The rest of this rock
is actually empty space.

31:24.422 --> 31:28.125
So, back in 1937, Professor Hikita here
and Dr Emilio Lizardo

31:28.259 --> 31:31.795
figured that if solid matter
were mostly just empty space,

31:31.929 --> 31:36.233
a person should be able to discover
a way to travel inside things.

31:36.366 --> 31:40.604
We at the Banzai Institute
have at last found that way.

31:40.737 --> 31:43.573
We have created a device

31:43.707 --> 31:47.210
called an oscillation overthruster,

31:47.344 --> 31:51.147
which systematically reorders matter

31:51.281 --> 31:55.752
by annihilating electrons, positrons...

31:55.885 --> 31:59.656
I get it. What you're saying is that
oppositely-charged particles collide,

31:59.789 --> 32:04.660
and blow each other up in a burst of energy.
Like a tiny big bang, like a... baby bang.

32:07.063 --> 32:10.766
I'm probably just stating the very obvious.
Shut up, Penny. Shut up.

32:10.900 --> 32:14.937
Oh, no. It's not obvious at all. If it was obvious,
everybody would be doing it every day.

32:15.071 --> 32:19.542
See, by all accounts, it appears as though
I literally went right through a mountain.

32:19.675 --> 32:23.645
But you could take that mountain
and pulverise it...

32:23.779 --> 32:28.784
and sift through it like breadcrumbs
for the rest of your natural life...

32:28.917 --> 32:34.289
and you would never ever find... this.

32:35.490 --> 32:40.495
And yet this living organism came out
of that mountain in Texas with me.

32:40.629 --> 32:44.499
Even though I was never
inside that mountain.

32:45.233 --> 32:46.634
The president's calling.

32:46.768 --> 32:49.971
- The president of what?
- The president of the United States.

32:50.104 --> 32:52.473
Oh. Here.

32:52.607 --> 32:53.841
Later.

32:53.975 --> 32:58.145
- Is he still delirious?
- I can't tell. It's real fuzzy. I patched him
through to a payphone down the hall.

32:58.279 --> 33:02.383
- Do your thing.
- Buckaroo, you forgot your thruster.

33:02.516 --> 33:05.386
Why don't you hold onto it for a while?

33:05.519 --> 33:07.354
Any time.

33:07.488 --> 33:10.024
Do we have the first slide, please?

33:10.157 --> 33:13.560
What about the Pentagon?
The possibility of war

33:13.694 --> 33:16.196
in the Eighth Dimension, Mr Secretary?

33:16.330 --> 33:17.331
What?

33:17.831 --> 33:22.169
It seemed like a strange connection
even back at the bus.

33:24.705 --> 33:26.673
Mr President?

33:28.508 --> 33:30.877
Some kind of interference.

33:32.679 --> 33:34.714
Hello, Mr President?

33:34.848 --> 33:38.017
Mr President? Mr President, hello?

33:38.718 --> 33:40.286
Hello, Mr President?

33:40.853 --> 33:43.890
- What's going on?
- Maybe it's a prankster, some computer whiz kid.

33:44.023 --> 33:46.058
Not with Elephant Bravo.

33:46.192 --> 33:50.496
- Not with an alpha clearance.
- Alpha clearance? Hello? Mr...

33:50.596 --> 33:54.900
Ed, go back to the bus and reroute this call to
the president's suite at Walter Reed Hospital.

33:55.034 --> 33:59.872
Yeah, and make sure this is on the level.
We're busy people here.

34:00.005 --> 34:02.107
Does the President call him a lot?

34:06.845 --> 34:08.780
Pencil! Pen! Quick! Anything!

34:08.914 --> 34:10.649
Don't touch him!

34:12.617 --> 34:15.253
What's he writing?

34:15.387 --> 34:16.788
Conference room!

34:16.922 --> 34:18.924
Conference room! Let's go!

34:19.056 --> 34:21.426
Launch thermopod.

34:33.371 --> 34:35.639
- There they are.
- Dr Banzai.

34:35.773 --> 34:38.342
- Don't you see 'em?
- What do you mean? Who?

34:38.476 --> 34:42.880
Evil! Pure and simple from the
Eighth Dimension! Grab 'em!

34:43.380 --> 34:46.951
- Lectroids! Grab 'em!
- Lectroids? He's got a gun.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.521
OK, wise guy!

34:53.322 --> 34:58.128
Let those gun belts hit the floor!
Nobody follows or the Prof is history!

35:00.264 --> 35:03.300
- Where's Buckaroo?
- Get him.

35:03.433 --> 35:07.571
- Where's the overthruster?
- Get an ambulance.

35:23.419 --> 35:27.890
- Come on, will you just ignore them?
- Isn't that...?

35:51.647 --> 35:54.049
Hey, wait a minute! You can't ride that!

35:55.684 --> 35:57.752
It's Buckaroo Banzai!

36:10.531 --> 36:11.566
- Hold it!
- Freeze!

36:33.520 --> 36:37.724
- I had my eyes open all day long, Burt.
- It may not be a total loss.

36:37.858 --> 36:42.229
- I'm about ready to go home.
- We might see something.

36:46.933 --> 36:50.036
I hit it! It is wounded.

36:51.838 --> 36:54.240
What'd it look like to you?

36:54.374 --> 36:57.544
- Like a big black flying dinosaur.
- Dinosaur? It was purple.

36:57.677 --> 37:02.482
- That's what it looked like. It was black.
- It was purple. It'll be dark before we even find it.

37:03.616 --> 37:06.886
We get Professor Hikita
to cough up the crucial missing circuit

37:07.019 --> 37:09.288
and then we finally get our butts off this rock!

37:09.422 --> 37:12.291
Oh, yeah? Listen to this!

37:13.225 --> 37:16.729
Well, what is it? What is it?

37:16.862 --> 37:18.797
Black thermopod emergency beacon!

37:18.931 --> 37:21.600
Here? On Earth?

37:21.734 --> 37:25.737
- Why? John Bigbooté, why?
- Coordinates established.

37:25.871 --> 37:28.874
Electromagnetic energy
back on route three.

37:47.492 --> 37:50.595
- The whole top of the tree's squashed!
- Do you think it up there?

37:50.728 --> 37:52.630
Let's wait for the cops, Burt.

37:52.764 --> 37:55.666
What for? Are you scared?

37:55.800 --> 37:58.970
- There's gotta be something there.
- Come on, Burt. There's nothing up there.

37:59.103 --> 38:02.540
Well, how do you know?
Here, hold this. Hold this!

38:04.909 --> 38:08.145
Where you going? Where you going?!

38:08.279 --> 38:10.314
Christmas shopping.

38:12.449 --> 38:15.986
- What's that?
- It's a stick. What's it look like?

38:17.488 --> 38:19.823
- Gimme some light, will ya?
- I got two guns in my hands.

38:19.957 --> 38:22.893
- Put one of them down.
- I ain't putting the guns down!

38:23.026 --> 38:26.363
- It's just a tree.
- Then leave it alone!

38:26.496 --> 38:30.033
Aagh! See, I told you!
I told you! Leave it alone!

38:33.136 --> 38:36.072
Run! Run! Run!

38:36.206 --> 38:41.411
- Shoot it, Bubba. Shoot it!
- I can't! It's jammed! It's jammed!

38:45.648 --> 38:49.252
There's something.
There's something coming out!

38:49.385 --> 38:51.287
- Where?
- Out of the top.

38:55.958 --> 38:57.660
Oh, my soul!

38:59.461 --> 39:04.033
Throw me my gun, Bubba. Throw it.

39:06.735 --> 39:07.936
Sorry.

39:21.249 --> 39:22.283
Is he dead?

39:22.417 --> 39:25.420
Yeah, I think so. But look
at his face. It's changing.

39:25.553 --> 39:28.823
And his hair...
his hair is all disappeared.

39:28.990 --> 39:34.028
- What's that smell? You smell electricity?
- He's crackling. We're standing in water.

39:34.162 --> 39:35.396
What is he, Burt?
Is he radioactive?

39:35.530 --> 39:39.433
How the hell do I know?
Do I look like a nuclear genius?

39:39.567 --> 39:41.769
He's probably from Mars.
Or Jupiter.

39:41.902 --> 39:44.271
Jupiter? I hope he's alone.

39:44.405 --> 39:46.540
- There's somethin' over there.
- Where?

39:46.674 --> 39:48.709
Right there.

39:56.116 --> 39:58.151
What is it?

40:01.054 --> 40:05.125
Buckaroo Banzai. It's the latest issue.

40:08.228 --> 40:11.331
Rawhide, come in. Rawhide.

40:11.898 --> 40:13.166
Rawhide.

40:13.299 --> 40:17.570
Buckaroo, what's up? Where in Hades
are you? I'm gettin' a lot of static.

40:17.704 --> 40:21.140
Yeah. That's me.

40:21.274 --> 40:25.978
I've been ionised, but I'm OK now.

40:26.112 --> 40:29.815
Listen, I'm switching
on the homing beacon.

40:29.949 --> 40:33.619
Mark two minute intervals... now.

40:33.753 --> 40:38.324
Look, we got the overthruster. But someone
shanghaied the professor right from the conference.

40:38.457 --> 40:43.195
- Oh, the deuce you say.
- What do you think?

40:43.328 --> 40:46.698
- Dr Lizardo, maybe?
- Yeah, I'd put money on it.

40:46.832 --> 40:49.501
- That crate.
- What crate?

40:49.635 --> 40:52.537
The crate they shoved in that van.

40:52.671 --> 40:54.206
You and the guys...

40:54.339 --> 40:58.109
go back to the house and dig up
everything you can on an outfit called

40:58.210 --> 41:00.612
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

41:00.745 --> 41:04.049
- You got that?
- Right. Yoyodyne. We're on it.

41:07.152 --> 41:10.555
Hand me that tarp, will ya?
Let's cover this guy up.

41:10.688 --> 41:13.725
- Guy? What guy?
- He's got paws.

41:16.194 --> 41:18.362
- Now what?
- Who are they?

41:20.364 --> 41:22.400
Cover it up.

41:29.373 --> 41:31.208
John Bigbooté, Officer.

41:31.342 --> 41:34.044
Head of Operations,
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

41:34.178 --> 41:38.315
- There's one of our birds.
- That fella over there one of your birds, too?

41:38.415 --> 41:40.517
The droid, you mean?

41:41.385 --> 41:46.256
Doesn't look like anything I've seen
before. I mean, I've seen droids...

41:47.190 --> 41:48.592
Nice night, huh?

42:02.438 --> 42:05.208
That big thing over there attacked me.

42:05.341 --> 42:08.244
Impossible. No, no, no, no, no, no.

42:08.377 --> 42:12.081
Yeah! It's some kinda creature.
There's part of it still stuck in the tree.

42:12.214 --> 42:16.418
No, it's a machine with 30-foot
leather wings. I think it's radioactive.

42:17.286 --> 42:21.090
Three minutes since he last moved.
This is a fix. Something is happening.

42:21.223 --> 42:23.092
Let's get somebody over there.

42:23.225 --> 42:26.495
Al, you set up the grid
and get the last known coordinates.

42:26.628 --> 42:29.598
Tommy, hop on the Marconi
and see if we got Blue Blazes

42:29.731 --> 42:32.801
in a ten-minute radius.
But no strike teams, Tommy, understand?

42:32.934 --> 42:35.637
I'm headed downstairs.
Keep everybody calm.

42:39.975 --> 42:43.111
- Hikita-san.
- Buckaroo!

42:44.212 --> 42:48.016
Repeating: Intrastate outward band five.

42:48.149 --> 42:51.586
Coded. Calling all Blue Blaze
irregulars in the Garden State.

42:52.387 --> 42:56.491
Buckaroo... in trouble.
Will repeat coordinates.

42:56.624 --> 43:01.929
This is Scooter Lindley, Junior Blue Blaze
irregular 41 and a half. Hang on.

43:03.264 --> 43:06.767
- Dad! Dad! Buckaroo's in trouble!
- Say what?

43:06.901 --> 43:10.471
Aliens from the Eighth Dimension.
I'm seeing them now.

43:10.604 --> 43:12.439
You can see them now? Here?

43:12.573 --> 43:16.343
Yeah, the three jerks driving this van.
Look at this. What is this?

43:18.078 --> 43:19.947
It's your hand, Buckaroo.

43:20.080 --> 43:23.617
No, no, no, no, it's a formula.
It's an antidote of some kind.

43:23.750 --> 43:27.187
Whatever that was in that phoney call
from the president gave me information,

43:27.320 --> 43:31.625
some electrochemical message that
allows me to see what they really are.

43:31.758 --> 43:36.062
- What are they?
- Lectroids from Planet Ten
by way of the Eighth Dimension.

43:36.629 --> 43:38.498
Mr Gomez?

43:38.631 --> 43:41.234
- I got a truck on the way to help mop things up.
- Identification?

43:41.367 --> 43:46.105
Or else this place'll become a zoo,
not to mention a haven for gawkers.

43:46.205 --> 43:48.474
Wait a minute. Now just a second.

43:48.608 --> 43:51.444
- Stay put. All of ya.
- Sure thing.

43:52.611 --> 43:54.980
We'll go ahead and start breaking it down.

43:55.114 --> 43:57.349
Don't touch it!

43:57.483 --> 44:00.886
I got my own help on the way.
Now, that's an order.

44:04.957 --> 44:07.092
Go find something to crack it open.

44:07.226 --> 44:08.961
There's a Harley in those bushes.

44:09.061 --> 44:12.698
I want you to get out and go to the laboratory,
start working on this formula.

44:12.831 --> 44:17.369
- I want you to synthesise it.
- Buckaroo! Give me the formula.

44:32.817 --> 44:33.551
Oh, wow!

44:35.553 --> 44:36.053
Peggy!

44:36.087 --> 44:40.224
She's not Peggy, Mrs Johnson.
Sois sage, mon amie.

44:40.358 --> 44:43.928
No. Of course not. How could she be?

44:44.061 --> 44:47.031
- Any word from Buckaroo?
- No, I thought he was with you guys.

44:47.164 --> 44:51.435
No, he's not. Ah, Dr Zwibel,
Penny Priddy... Mrs Johnson.

44:51.568 --> 44:55.439
Nice to meet you.
The fellas call me New Jersey.

45:00.944 --> 45:04.781
- Well, where are they all going?
- Bunk house. Off limits.

45:08.518 --> 45:10.620
Again, John Gomez!

45:14.257 --> 45:16.726
John O'Connor,
there's a crowbar in the truck.

45:16.860 --> 45:18.895
I'll get it.

45:33.075 --> 45:36.278
Destroy yourself, John Gant.

45:37.112 --> 45:39.148
Set detonator.

45:43.285 --> 45:45.788
Detonator set.

45:46.755 --> 45:51.560
My most profuse apologies
to my homeland and loved ones.

45:51.727 --> 45:55.564
John Valuk is dead. He fell on his head.

45:56.765 --> 46:00.769
Perhaps John Parker will get through
with our message to Buckaroo Banzai.

46:00.902 --> 46:03.505
I said back off! Now, dammit, I mean it!

46:03.638 --> 46:06.808
Hey! Hey, leave him alone! Ugh!

46:07.775 --> 46:12.347
Easy, friend. Ha, Buckaroo Banzai!

46:15.316 --> 46:16.384
Hey!

46:17.018 --> 46:19.987
It's Buckaroo Banzai! Get him!

46:31.332 --> 46:32.333
Hustle up!

46:59.325 --> 47:04.330
Scooter Lindley, Blue Blaze Irregular.

47:16.709 --> 47:20.446
- It is! It is Professor Hikita.
- We're closing the gate. Please, step back!

47:20.579 --> 47:23.849
- Where's Buckaroo?

47:36.394 --> 47:40.165
We gotta have something for him.
Try a new cipher.

47:44.669 --> 47:47.138
- Try a G-cipher.
- G-cipher.

47:49.040 --> 47:51.109
There...

47:51.342 --> 47:52.310
That's more like it.

47:52.944 --> 47:57.582
Looks like we've accessed their restricted
data file. Could be highly revealing.

47:57.715 --> 48:01.819
No sign of Buckaroo. The professor
just rode up saying something

48:01.952 --> 48:06.023
about space monsters and where's the
overthruster. Went straight to the lab.

48:06.190 --> 48:07.992
Space monsters, my ass.

48:11.128 --> 48:13.831
Hey, man, nice jacket.

48:21.171 --> 48:24.041
What's in the big pink box?

48:27.944 --> 48:31.514
Hey, buddy. May I help you?

48:31.648 --> 48:33.783
Hello! Buckaroo Banzai!?

48:33.917 --> 48:36.386
You a messenger? What you got here?

48:36.519 --> 48:40.590
No, no, wait a minute.
I need see Buckaroo Banzai in person.

48:40.990 --> 48:44.360
My name is John Parker.

48:44.494 --> 48:46.129
Identify yourself, no?

48:46.796 --> 48:49.599
Blue Blaze irregular Pinky Carruthers.

48:49.699 --> 48:54.170
Sorry, John, everybody
needs see Buckaroo. Later.

48:54.770 --> 48:57.106
Gino, run this down to the professor for me.

48:57.239 --> 48:58.841
Sounds like he's getting a little nervous.

49:00.909 --> 49:03.479
- This is queer. Look.
- What's up? What you got?

49:03.612 --> 49:08.650
All these people applied for social security cards
in the same town in New Jersey on exact same date.

49:08.784 --> 49:10.018
New Jersey?

49:10.752 --> 49:14.423
46 Yoyodyne employees,
Grover's Mill, New Jersey,

49:14.589 --> 49:16.958
11-1-38.

49:17.092 --> 49:18.693
I got some pictures, boys.

49:20.595 --> 49:24.632
It looks like a practical joke.
Check out these names:

49:24.766 --> 49:29.537
John Yaya? John Parrot?
John Bigbooty?

49:29.671 --> 49:33.307
Maybe not.
John Nolan? John O'Connor?

49:33.441 --> 49:35.576
No way, José.

49:35.710 --> 49:41.382
John Small Berries? It's a joke. Maybe
that's what Buckaroo was talking about.

49:41.515 --> 49:44.852
No, Reno, there are no ages
and no places of birth.

49:44.985 --> 49:49.423
Uh, Grover's Mill. Grover's Mill, 1938.
Why's that so familiar?

49:50.057 --> 49:54.428
They all have the same first name.
John, John, John, John, John.

49:54.561 --> 49:58.232
Somebody's playing games.
This is statistically impossible.

49:58.365 --> 50:00.500
No, no, no. Wait a minute,
wait a minute, um...

50:00.634 --> 50:02.602
November one. October.

50:02.903 --> 50:05.605
30 days have September, April,
June, November. Short February.

50:05.739 --> 50:09.276
And all the rest have 31. October 31st.

50:09.409 --> 50:11.711
Halloween.

50:11.845 --> 50:13.713
Oh, um...

50:13.847 --> 50:16.249
Don't you get it? Orson Welles.

50:16.382 --> 50:19.085
You mean the guy from
the old wine commercials?

50:19.219 --> 50:23.356
Halloween, 1938. War of the Worlds,
that fake radio news broadcast

50:23.489 --> 50:26.959
that got everybody scared,
thinking real, live Martians...

50:27.894 --> 50:30.763
were landing in Grover's Mill...

50:31.731 --> 50:34.200
New Jersey.

50:34.333 --> 50:36.735
Then it all just turned out to be a hoax.

50:36.869 --> 50:37.870
So?

50:38.704 --> 50:44.476
So... maybe it wasn't a hoax.
Or, I mean, maybe it isn't a hoax.

50:53.018 --> 50:56.254
If we don't find the overthruster,
Whorfin'll have us for supper.

50:56.388 --> 50:59.891
Who says the damn
thing's even here?

51:19.143 --> 51:21.178
Come on! Come on!

51:39.162 --> 51:41.965
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

52:07.723 --> 52:10.726
All right, who's the wise guy?

52:13.696 --> 52:16.265
I said, who's the wise guy?

52:29.411 --> 52:31.380
It's locked.

52:37.185 --> 52:39.654
John O'Connor, smash the window.

52:39.821 --> 52:42.757
Why me, John Bigbooté?

52:46.895 --> 52:49.297
It might be booby-trapped.

52:49.430 --> 52:51.199
Oh.

52:57.738 --> 52:59.874
- Buckaroo!
- Mrs Johnson, this is Casper and Scooter Lindley.

53:00.007 --> 53:02.143
Is Hikita-san here yet? Where's
the overthruster? Where's Penny?

53:02.276 --> 53:06.680
Prof is in the lab with the overthruster. Penny's
in the right wing guest room. Everybody's safe and sound.

53:06.780 --> 53:08.816
- They're lectroids, Buckaroo.
- From Planet Ten.

53:08.949 --> 53:12.252
- Planet Ten? How do you guys know?
- It's all on the yellow record. Come on.

53:12.386 --> 53:13.787
- Casper Lindley.
- Reno.

53:13.921 --> 53:18.058
- Yellow record?
- However, they didn't come here on a nonstop flight.

53:18.192 --> 53:21.928
They blasted through the Eighth
Dimension in 1938 over in Grover's Mill.

53:22.062 --> 53:25.165
Where there was a huge
electrical dimensional accident.

53:25.298 --> 53:29.269
Some giant explosion. And they hypnotised
Orson Welles into covering it up.

53:29.402 --> 53:32.605
So, first he says there's
an invasion from Mars,

53:32.739 --> 53:35.842
but then he says, no, no, no,
it's just a radio-show hoax.

53:35.975 --> 53:37.243
- Get it?
- No.

53:37.377 --> 53:40.647
- Let's go.
- Orson Welles? What about Yoyodyne? What about Dr Lizardo?

53:40.780 --> 53:44.317
- That's what we're trying to tell you.
- There's someone living inside him.

53:45.451 --> 53:46.786
- Buckaroo.
- Pinky.

53:46.919 --> 53:52.992
Put this on. Here, y'all put these on.
There's more in the box and there's one over there.

53:53.125 --> 53:56.495
- What's this?
- It came with the record. It's like a 3-D type thing.

53:56.629 --> 53:59.031
How am I supposed to know
he's from outer space?

53:59.164 --> 54:02.801
This Rasta guy pedals up to the front gate
and delivers it all in a pink cake box.

54:02.935 --> 54:05.337
- What? What for?
- We don't know. It wouldn't tell us.

54:05.471 --> 54:09.308
- It wants to talk to the head honcho.
- Lights.

54:21.853 --> 54:24.155
Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai.

54:25.423 --> 54:29.661
I am John Emdall from Planet Ten.

54:29.794 --> 54:33.898
A common, grave danger
confronts both our worlds.

54:34.499 --> 54:37.401
- After a bloody reign of terror...
- Hey, what is that?

54:37.535 --> 54:40.838
...the hated leader of a military caste...

54:40.972 --> 54:44.809
the self-proclaimed "Lord" John Whorfin,

54:44.909 --> 54:47.845
a bloodthirsty butcher
as evil as your Hitler...

54:47.978 --> 54:48.979
Oh, wow!

54:49.113 --> 54:52.716
...was overthrown
by freedom-loving forces...

54:52.850 --> 54:57.521
tried and condemned, along with
several hundred of his followers,

54:57.654 --> 55:03.193
to spend eternity in the formless void
of the Eighth Dimension.

55:03.326 --> 55:06.062
Did you tell Penny that
Buckaroo's looking for her?

55:06.196 --> 55:07.464
I looked in her room.
She wasn't there.

55:07.597 --> 55:09.232
- Who's Penny?
- Where is she?

55:09.366 --> 55:12.602
Will everybody shut up
so I can hear the rest of this thing?

55:12.736 --> 55:18.441
And now you, Buckaroo Banzai, have
unintentionally helped John Whorfin

55:18.942 --> 55:22.045
with the success of your
oscillation overthruster.

55:22.178 --> 55:28.384
For our intelligence warns us that
he intends to steal your overthruster.

55:28.517 --> 55:33.556
If he should attempt this,
we will have no choice

55:33.689 --> 55:37.459
but to disrupt worldwide
electronic communications

55:37.593 --> 55:42.164
and fire a particle-beam weapon
from your airspace

55:42.297 --> 55:46.869
to Smolensk in the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics.

55:46.969 --> 55:50.572
That an action that the Kremlin will most certainly
misinterpret as an American first strike.

55:50.706 --> 55:57.812
- They're already a little trigger-happy.
- Stop John Whorfin before sunset.

55:57.946 --> 56:02.951
If you fail, we will be forced
to help you destroy yourselves.

56:03.084 --> 56:05.987
- If it ain't one thing, it's another.
- Lighten up.

56:06.121 --> 56:08.923
End of discussion.

56:10.158 --> 56:12.860
Discussion? What discussion?

56:15.763 --> 56:20.101
She gotta be kidding, right?
Vaporise the whole damn planet?

56:20.234 --> 56:25.639
- You wanna roll those dice, Casper?
- No, no, no, not me, man. No way.

56:25.773 --> 56:29.276
Gents... we're going to Yoyodyne.

56:29.410 --> 56:32.012
Rawhide, see how Hikita-san is
with that formula.

56:32.146 --> 56:34.715
Billy, tell Sam to prep
the jet car for city driving.

56:34.848 --> 56:37.151
What about a Blue Blaze strike team?

56:37.284 --> 56:41.054
We keep it intimate. Call the Kolodny
Brothers. Call the Rug Suckers.

56:41.188 --> 56:44.291
- Where are you going?
- Get my guns.

56:45.859 --> 56:47.694
His guns?

56:48.094 --> 56:51.498
Okay, okay, I'm a girl. I don't deny it.
I sneaked into your bedroom.

56:51.631 --> 56:54.534
I invaded your privacy.
I went through your personal belongings.

56:54.667 --> 56:59.038
- Mrs Johnson! I can never find anything around here...
- I took a bath!

56:59.172 --> 57:03.209
- Penny, what's your problem?
- Me! You! That picture!

57:03.342 --> 57:07.914
I'm going crazy. Who's that girl, Buckaroo?
What's going on around here?

57:08.047 --> 57:10.383
You drag me out of jail.
You're like Jerry Lewis.

57:10.516 --> 57:13.352
You give me hope to carry on, but then
you leave me in the lurch

57:13.486 --> 57:17.556
while you strap on your six-guns.
What do you want from me?

57:17.690 --> 57:20.025
- Who am I?
- As near as I can figure...

57:20.526 --> 57:24.096
you had an identical twin sister and...

57:24.229 --> 57:26.265
I married her.

57:27.299 --> 57:29.101
But that's over now.

57:29.234 --> 57:34.372
And she's gone and that's about all
there is, really, to say about that.

57:45.316 --> 57:50.855
We don't know what to expect here.
It disagrees with all the standard pictures.

57:51.723 --> 57:55.059
It's producing a magnetic force.

57:55.193 --> 57:57.595
No, no. I'm wrong!

58:09.006 --> 58:10.941
Hey!

58:14.511 --> 58:16.747
Oh, tell me I'm dreaming.

58:17.714 --> 58:19.850
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's...

58:20.017 --> 58:23.453
- Buckaroo! Sorry. Sam's dead.
- Sam?

58:23.587 --> 58:25.922
Someone broke into the jet-car.
Things are going haywire over at the lab.

58:26.056 --> 58:28.091
Wait here. I'll be right back.

58:39.469 --> 58:40.503
Oh, boy.

58:48.578 --> 58:54.250
He's dead. Spread out.
They can't be very far off.

58:55.985 --> 58:59.755
Okay. Tommy, check the biomedical labs.
Reno, take physics. Jersey, go with Reno.

58:59.888 --> 59:02.091
- Where you going?
- Engineering.

59:03.525 --> 59:06.195
Cowboy! Hold your gun
in front of you, man.

59:06.328 --> 59:08.964
- Oh, I see. I got that. OK.
- It's cool.

59:21.443 --> 59:23.044
Buckaroo, behind you!

59:32.687 --> 59:36.290
- You... you OK?
- Yeah. Just let me catch my breath.

59:36.390 --> 59:40.227
Professor went down into the purification
vent. He's got the overthruster.

59:40.361 --> 59:42.396
All right.

59:52.539 --> 59:55.075
Why is there a watermelon there?

59:56.543 --> 59:58.612
I'll tell you later.

01:00:31.043 --> 01:00:32.878
Buckaroo?

01:00:36.749 --> 01:00:38.484
Rawhide?

01:00:39.685 --> 01:00:41.286
Anybody?

01:01:07.979 --> 01:01:11.816
Here, young lady. The overthruster.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.489
Here, put this in your purse.

01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:22.326
Get out of here!

01:01:24.995 --> 01:01:27.164
Where's your overthruster?

01:01:27.298 --> 01:01:29.333
Hikita-san!

01:01:34.738 --> 01:01:37.207
Nice morning, huh?

01:01:51.154 --> 01:01:53.790
It's just making my legs asleep.

01:01:53.923 --> 01:01:57.660
- What the hell is wrong with him?
- I don't know. I don't know. Are you cold?

01:01:58.294 --> 01:01:59.729
It's my spine.

01:02:06.802 --> 01:02:11.040
- What're you still doing on this floor?
- I think it's cos I can't move my legs.

01:02:11.641 --> 01:02:13.909
Ooh, damn!

01:02:15.778 --> 01:02:18.414
- What is it? Apache?
- Arachtoid.

01:02:18.547 --> 01:02:21.350
Oh, spiders. So I was right, huh?

01:02:21.483 --> 01:02:24.887
We got the guy, Rawhide.
Sucker only tried...

01:02:25.654 --> 01:02:28.824
- Any antidote for these things?
- No. Not at all.

01:02:30.225 --> 01:02:33.895
- Come over here.
- Does that mean you're on our side?

01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:35.664
That's right.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:43.605
Man! Those things
pack a mean wallop, huh?

01:02:44.239 --> 01:02:46.708
What are y'all looking at?

01:02:47.709 --> 01:02:51.612
You're on the clock. Let's saddle up, huh?

01:02:59.487 --> 01:03:02.023
Hey, man, they're stealing my helicopter!

01:03:05.759 --> 01:03:07.828
They've got Penny!

01:03:07.962 --> 01:03:10.864
She has the overthruster.

01:03:10.965 --> 01:03:14.001
We'll get it back. We'll get it back.

01:03:14.568 --> 01:03:21.074
It's... it's not Buckaroo Banzai per se,
Mr President. It's his men.

01:03:21.208 --> 01:03:24.811
Foreigners, some of 'em.
Or their names have been changed.

01:03:24.945 --> 01:03:28.748
Their true backgrounds
are shrouded in secrecy!

01:03:28.882 --> 01:03:34.220
Now, all I'm saying is that this jet car
belongs in the hands of Defense.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:38.725
I mean, if the Banzai Institute
doesn't want to sell it to us,

01:03:38.825 --> 01:03:41.127
then we're gonna have
to take it from them!

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:44.363
In national interest, of course.

01:03:46.232 --> 01:03:47.833
Come in.

01:03:47.967 --> 01:03:53.139
Excuse me, Mr President, World Watch One.
Direct-incoming transmission.

01:03:53.272 --> 01:03:54.673
Yeah.

01:04:00.679 --> 01:04:03.148
Hello, Mr President, I know your back is killing you,

01:04:03.282 --> 01:04:07.352
but I have a developing situation here
and I must speak frankly.

01:04:07.486 --> 01:04:11.089
Buckaroo...
Secretary of Defense McKinley

01:04:11.189 --> 01:04:14.826
and my National Security Advisor
Smirnoff, are visiting me,

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.362
but I have no secrets from them.

01:04:17.495 --> 01:04:20.966
Well, something has reared
its ugly head in outer space, Mr President,

01:04:21.099 --> 01:04:23.768
and it looks like the Earth is caught in a crossfire.

01:04:23.868 --> 01:04:26.804
We have reason to believe
that there are vicious red aliens

01:04:26.938 --> 01:04:30.475
walking freely among us,
posing as the owners and operators

01:04:30.608 --> 01:04:32.643
of Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

01:04:32.777 --> 01:04:38.516
Yoyodyne Propulsion... the people
working on our Truncheon Bomber?

01:04:38.649 --> 01:04:43.220
- In the hands of foreign nationals?
- Excuse me, Mr President. Time is short.

01:04:44.188 --> 01:04:47.124
In order to prevent
John Whorfin's escape,

01:04:47.224 --> 01:04:50.995
my comrades are at this very moment
taking up a geostationary position

01:04:51.128 --> 01:04:54.364
over New Jersey.
This situation is explosive.

01:04:54.498 --> 01:04:56.967
- Who the hell is that?
- Explosive, what are you saying man?

01:04:57.067 --> 01:04:58.969
Some kind of race war in New Jersey?

01:04:59.069 --> 01:05:00.470
No, Mr President, no.

01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:04.441
This man as you call him is not
a human being at all, but is, in fact,

01:05:04.574 --> 01:05:08.712
a black lectroid named John Parker
from the very same Planet Ten.

01:05:08.845 --> 01:05:12.615
And his spaceship is, at this moment,
anchored above Yoyodyne.

01:05:12.749 --> 01:05:13.717
Yoyodyne.

01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:16.786
- Buckaroo, my good friend...
- That's it!

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:20.757
These red creatures, they must
somehow give off the bacteria.

01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:25.895
We breathe it. It swims up our nose
into our cerebral cortex

01:05:26.028 --> 01:05:29.465
where it talks to our brain cells.

01:05:29.599 --> 01:05:32.635
Tells us to see exactly
what they want us to see.

01:05:32.768 --> 01:05:34.236
Electric brainwashing.

01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:36.005
Diabolical. They got us so confused...

01:05:36.105 --> 01:05:39.208
Buckaroo, I don't know what to say.

01:05:40.542 --> 01:05:43.746
Lectroids from Planet Ten?

01:05:43.879 --> 01:05:46.815
Nuclear extortion?

01:05:46.949 --> 01:05:49.251
A girl named John?

01:05:49.384 --> 01:05:51.119
Buckaroo, Lectroid Wing Commander.

01:05:51.253 --> 01:05:54.990
Excuse me, Mr President,
I have to go talk to the hornet's nest.

01:05:56.291 --> 01:05:58.260
Good God.

01:05:58.393 --> 01:06:02.931
Well, if it wasn't Buckaroo Banzai,
I'd say commit the man.

01:06:03.064 --> 01:06:04.666
Get me SAC Headquarters, Omaha,

01:06:04.799 --> 01:06:08.736
NORAD and the Strategic Space Command.
I want some hard data on that cloud.

01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:12.106
John, get out in the field.
Stick your beak into this one.

01:06:13.574 --> 01:06:17.278
- What is this thing made of?
- Cobalt and electricity.

01:06:17.411 --> 01:06:21.949
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.

01:06:22.083 --> 01:06:24.218
World Watch One.

01:06:26.921 --> 01:06:28.889
Buckaroo.

01:06:29.056 --> 01:06:31.091
It's Whorfin.

01:06:34.161 --> 01:06:35.662
Dr Banzai?

01:06:37.798 --> 01:06:40.968
Yes, this is Emilio Lizardo.

01:06:41.101 --> 01:06:43.370
Maybe you don't remember me.

01:06:44.337 --> 01:06:48.174
Ah. I'm flattered.
We know the same people.

01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:52.012
Yeah. In fact, one of them
is with me right now.

01:06:52.145 --> 01:06:54.180
Your associate...

01:06:54.314 --> 01:06:56.783
Dr Penny Priddy.

01:06:56.883 --> 01:06:58.218
Doctor?

01:06:58.351 --> 01:07:00.987
May I pass along my congratulations

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:04.957
for your great
interdimensional breakthrough.

01:07:05.057 --> 01:07:10.162
I'm sure in the miserable annals of
the Earth, you will be duly enshrined.

01:07:12.031 --> 01:07:16.001
However... Miss Priddy claims

01:07:16.135 --> 01:07:18.971
to be unable to solve my problem

01:07:19.071 --> 01:07:22.274
and provide me with
the crucial missing circuit

01:07:22.441 --> 01:07:24.042
for my overthruster!

01:07:24.676 --> 01:07:26.712
He hasn't found it. He hasn't found it.

01:07:26.845 --> 01:07:29.381
Maybe you can convince her to try.

01:07:30.382 --> 01:07:32.417
John O'Connor!

01:07:33.351 --> 01:07:35.020
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget about me!

01:07:35.153 --> 01:07:38.823
- They'll never break me. Never!
- Penny, get off the phone.

01:07:38.957 --> 01:07:42.861
Dr Lizardo, really what does she know
about an overthruster? She's not a scientist.

01:07:42.994 --> 01:07:46.698
Shall we play...
a Penny for your thoughts?

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.270
Maybe you can come in her place, huh?

01:07:52.403 --> 01:07:55.506
Yoyodyne, Banzai. You know the address.

01:07:55.606 --> 01:07:59.277
Come alone and bring your overthruster!

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:05.883
He'll come. I know his type.

01:08:06.016 --> 01:08:08.419
Take her to the pit!

01:08:08.552 --> 01:08:10.587
Go, Bigbooty!

01:08:13.123 --> 01:08:16.993
Use more honey!
Find out what she knows.

01:08:17.394 --> 01:08:20.930
These breathing devices Hikita-san has cooked up
will enable you to see them

01:08:21.064 --> 01:08:26.403
as they really are, as I've been seeing
them since yesterday - as Lectroids.

01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:29.406
In our eyes, they're not very pretty.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.509
Nothing personal, John Parker.

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:40.316
If we blow this today...
there ain't no tomorrow.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:44.120
We have only 240 minutes remaining.

01:08:44.252 --> 01:08:47.622
Right. I'm working under the assumption
that Penny still has the overthruster,

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:51.527
but this psycho Whorfin doesn't
know that. So that'll be my job.

01:08:51.661 --> 01:08:53.996
To get her and it back in one piece.

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:59.435
Your objective is to 86 Whorfin.
You know your two strike groups.

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:01.170
Apache group, that's you, Reno.

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:05.874
Chaparral group, that's you, Perfect
Tommy. Parker'll ride with Chaparral.

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:11.113
It's my guess that no human being
has ever been inside the place.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:16.618
So who knows what we're gonna find
there. Top priority is the overthruster.

01:09:16.751 --> 01:09:20.188
Without it, Whorfin
can't get off this planet.

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:24.024
This homing device will probably
make it very easy to find.

01:09:24.158 --> 01:09:26.661
And maybe a lot harder to get back.

01:09:27.529 --> 01:09:29.464
Strategic Space Command now reports

01:09:29.596 --> 01:09:33.434
all the surveillance satellite
communication jammed.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.037
Jammed? By who? Who by?

01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:38.939
Possible atmospheric conditions, sir.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.142
- Solar.
- Solar?

01:09:41.274 --> 01:09:45.679
Intelligence confirms that Soviets
are having the same problem.

01:09:45.813 --> 01:09:48.515
Should we be on Code Red?

01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:51.352
We go to Code Red,
the Russians go to Code Red.

01:09:51.484 --> 01:09:53.886
No sense going off half-cocked, Mr President.

01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:56.423
I don't know, but Buckaroo Banzai
has never been wrong before.

01:09:56.557 --> 01:09:59.793
The man's been through solid matter,
for crying out loud.

01:09:59.993 --> 01:10:01.795
Who knows what happened to his brain.

01:10:01.962 --> 01:10:04.064
Maybe it scrambled his molecules.

01:10:04.197 --> 01:10:07.567
All I'm saying is,
Mr President, let's not panic.

01:10:09.202 --> 01:10:11.037
What's happening?

01:10:13.206 --> 01:10:16.409
Electromagnetic pulsar.

01:10:19.712 --> 01:10:23.249
Russians just gone to
Defense Condition Two, sir.

01:10:23.383 --> 01:10:24.851
We've no choice, then.

01:10:25.418 --> 01:10:28.688
Mr President, I am a soldier,
and I'm a damn good one.

01:10:28.821 --> 01:10:31.757
I've got enough decorations
to snap a Christmas tree.

01:10:31.891 --> 01:10:36.929
All I'm trying to say is - and I hope
I speak for everyone in this room -

01:10:37.062 --> 01:10:40.232
is that I am scared.

01:10:40.366 --> 01:10:42.968
I'm barely holding my fudge right now.

01:10:43.102 --> 01:10:47.673
Stop acting like a goddamn schoolgirl,
General, and pull yourself together.

01:10:47.839 --> 01:10:51.943
I'm glad someone has
the balls to face facts.

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:01.019
- Don't embarrass us.
- Have I ever?

01:11:01.186 --> 01:11:04.422
Give me 30 minutes,
then come in and mop up.

01:11:18.603 --> 01:11:20.638
Shut up!

01:11:31.782 --> 01:11:34.585
I've had enough of you, Penny Priddy!

01:11:40.157 --> 01:11:44.895
Well... Mrs Johnson, thank you.

01:11:45.028 --> 01:11:49.466
It's certainly food for thought.

01:11:49.599 --> 01:11:53.903
No answer at the Kremlin, sir.
Just dead silence.

01:11:54.504 --> 01:11:57.207
Then I guess the moment is upon us.

01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:59.309
Here you go, Mr President.

01:11:59.409 --> 01:12:02.311
The Presidential Emergency Action Document.

01:12:02.412 --> 01:12:04.313
For your eyes only.

01:12:04.447 --> 01:12:06.482
John Hancock these, and Hail Mary.

01:12:06.616 --> 01:12:09.652
You know, on second thought, maybe
we should think this through a bit more

01:12:09.785 --> 01:12:13.389
so that future generations
of Americans will...

01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:15.491
Oh, wow.

01:12:17.493 --> 01:12:21.397
"Declaration of War: The Short Form."

01:12:36.044 --> 01:12:39.881
Bring that thing right through the gate.
Straight ahead, straight ahead, come on.

01:12:43.518 --> 01:12:47.088
Blacks... are on this planet!

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:51.025
Here, in New Jersey!

01:12:51.159 --> 01:12:54.595
Coming to destroy us!

01:12:54.729 --> 01:12:56.364
We must act!

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:59.533
Escape or die!

01:13:00.501 --> 01:13:02.737
We must work faster

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:06.640
to finish the great vehicle itself,

01:13:06.774 --> 01:13:11.378
so we can enter the Eighth Dimension

01:13:11.512 --> 01:13:15.616
and free our trapped comrades!

01:13:15.749 --> 01:13:18.719
So we can return home

01:13:18.852 --> 01:13:22.522
and seize power once again!

01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:29.162
- What is the greatest joy?
- The joy of duty!

01:13:29.296 --> 01:13:34.067
- Louder!
- The joy of duty!

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.604
History is made at night.

01:13:37.737 --> 01:13:42.842
Character is what you are in the dark!

01:13:42.975 --> 01:13:46.279
We must work while the clock,
she's ticking.

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:52.585
- We hide, they seek!
- Death to the Black Lectroids!

01:13:52.718 --> 01:13:55.754
- Where are we going?
- Planet Ten!

01:13:55.888 --> 01:13:58.157
- When?
- Real soon!

01:14:05.497 --> 01:14:09.034
Come on over here. Bring it this way!

01:14:12.004 --> 01:14:14.573
This way!

01:14:14.739 --> 01:14:16.541
Now park it.

01:14:18.076 --> 01:14:20.312
There's no overthruster!

01:14:23.648 --> 01:14:27.051
Get him here! Get him outta there!
I wanna see his face!

01:14:28.853 --> 01:14:31.055
It's not here!

01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:34.292
Take him to the shock tower.

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:53.710
The equations. Solve them.

01:14:53.844 --> 01:14:58.849
Enter your data on this keypad.
And you better be right.

01:14:58.982 --> 01:15:02.986
The shock tower is a lie detector.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.523
Any falsehood triggers a brutal charge

01:15:06.656 --> 01:15:09.926
to your auditory meatus.

01:15:12.162 --> 01:15:14.697
- Open circuit.
- So?

01:15:14.831 --> 01:15:19.035
You're not getting jack from me until
you let Penny out of this junkyard.

01:15:19.168 --> 01:15:22.872
Curse you, Banzai!
Don't you realise what are you saying?

01:15:23.005 --> 01:15:26.542
Your whole planet is gonna be destroyed
and you sit here wasting time?

01:15:26.676 --> 01:15:29.211
Time? I got nothing but time.

01:15:32.915 --> 01:15:37.386
Sealed with a curse as sharp as a knife.

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:41.390
Doomed is your soul
and damned is your life.

01:15:42.591 --> 01:15:44.293
Buzz off.

01:15:47.095 --> 01:15:49.131
Bigbooty...

01:15:49.264 --> 01:15:51.733
more power to him.

01:15:51.867 --> 01:15:54.402
Bigbooté.

01:15:54.536 --> 01:15:57.472
I want my missing circuit, now!

01:16:31.138 --> 01:16:35.142
- Is there something I can help you with?
- Is Buckaroo upstairs?

01:16:35.275 --> 01:16:38.011
Hello, Mr Secretary.

01:16:38.145 --> 01:16:39.212
Where is he?

01:16:41.248 --> 01:16:44.718
- That won't work either.
- Porco Giuda!

01:16:46.753 --> 01:16:48.555
Hey, Banzai.

01:16:51.324 --> 01:16:53.960
Take a look at your girlfriend.

01:16:57.931 --> 01:17:01.000
Devo lavorare con persone idiota!

01:17:05.271 --> 01:17:10.242
She'll live... but only for a while.

01:17:10.376 --> 01:17:13.679
And she won't enjoy it.

01:17:13.813 --> 01:17:16.549
Only you can save her from a fate

01:17:16.682 --> 01:17:19.918
even worse than that of
your friend, Mr Rawhide.

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:23.756
Missing circuit's in your head, Whorfin.

01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:26.158
Bigbooty...

01:17:26.291 --> 01:17:28.727
activate your probes.

01:17:46.845 --> 01:17:50.515
Slow this sucker down.
I'll handle these birds.

01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:00.925
You gentlemen have a telephone? You wanna jump
on the horn and get Mr John Bigboot.

01:18:01.058 --> 01:18:02.393
It's Bigbooté.

01:18:02.526 --> 01:18:06.764
Oh, hell, if you wanna do anything
nowadays, you gotta do it yourself.

01:18:06.897 --> 01:18:09.967
- What is your name?
- John Yaya.

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:13.470
John Yaya, huh? And you are?

01:18:13.604 --> 01:18:15.639
"John Small Berries."

01:18:36.626 --> 01:18:39.629
- He's down there. I feel it.
- We're not...

01:18:48.971 --> 01:18:54.643
- It's a nest.
- Birds nest. People don't nest.

01:18:54.777 --> 01:18:56.278
Red Lectroid.

01:19:20.001 --> 01:19:22.337
Don't touch it. It might be a bomb.

01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:23.705
Nah, it's a toy.

01:19:28.676 --> 01:19:32.346
- Sit down!
- Sir? Hey, that area's restricted.

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.883
Yeah? Not to me!

01:19:40.621 --> 01:19:45.826
This I know. This I know.
And I love Whorfin too.

01:19:50.230 --> 01:19:53.100
- What is this place?
- It's a bivouac. They sleep here.

01:19:53.233 --> 01:19:56.904
- Can they all shoot stingers?
- You better believe it.

01:19:57.037 --> 01:19:59.206
- Lizardo. Which way?
- Over there.

01:19:59.339 --> 01:20:01.875
- You sure?
- Believe it.

01:20:02.009 --> 01:20:04.044
Just once.

01:20:38.744 --> 01:20:40.779
- Where...?
- Shh.

01:20:43.215 --> 01:20:45.584
What's going on? Where are we?

01:20:45.717 --> 01:20:48.453
It's a bivouac, man. They sleep here.

01:21:05.036 --> 01:21:07.138
What's happening?

01:21:07.272 --> 01:21:09.907
John Isaac, get the boy! Andiamo!

01:21:10.041 --> 01:21:13.678
Bigbooty! Go down to the pit. Kill the girl!

01:21:16.948 --> 01:21:18.783
Scooter! Where are you?

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:32.129
Hey, somebody turn off
that gosh dang klaxon!

01:21:32.262 --> 01:21:37.301
Work. Work. Work.

01:21:40.304 --> 01:21:42.506
There are monkey boys in the facility.

01:21:43.507 --> 01:21:44.708
You are secure.

01:21:45.775 --> 01:21:46.810
Do not panic.

01:21:50.246 --> 01:21:52.482
John Emdall must die.

01:21:53.616 --> 01:21:56.119
Lord Whorfin must live.

01:21:57.987 --> 01:21:58.888
Work.

01:21:59.155 --> 01:22:00.523
Work.

01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:02.291
Work.

01:22:31.319 --> 01:22:32.721
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:22:32.854 --> 01:22:34.356
- Sidney.
- Buckaroo!

01:22:34.489 --> 01:22:37.592
It's good to see you, pal. You got a pistol?

01:22:37.726 --> 01:22:39.628
Yeah.

01:22:42.130 --> 01:22:44.365
What are you gonna use?

01:22:45.467 --> 01:22:48.002
- Where are we?
- I hate to tell you.

01:22:49.037 --> 01:22:51.406
Where are we going?

01:22:53.408 --> 01:22:55.443
This way.

01:23:04.218 --> 01:23:05.786
Get over here.

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:09.923
Keep your noses to the grindstone.

01:23:10.057 --> 01:23:12.626
The greatest joy is the joy of duty.

01:23:13.861 --> 01:23:16.930
Work. Work. Work.

01:23:17.664 --> 01:23:21.101
Monkey boys are feeble.
Lord Whorfin is supreme!

01:23:21.234 --> 01:23:27.007
Bigboot! Bigboot! Hold on a minute,
I wanna talk to you.

01:23:27.874 --> 01:23:32.512
What the hell's the matter with you?
You deaf? I said I wanna talk to you!

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.136
Jesus!

01:23:57.503 --> 01:24:01.507
What the hell is going on here,
Bigboot? Where's my bomber?

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:06.778
Bigbooté. John O'Connor,
put the slug on the track.

01:24:06.912 --> 01:24:09.848
I don't give a flying handshake
what your name is!

01:24:09.982 --> 01:24:13.318
I'm here to see a bomber!
This sure ain't it.

01:24:13.452 --> 01:24:16.988
Let's just go back upstairs to my office.

01:24:17.122 --> 01:24:19.491
Talk about this like
two reasonable beings.

01:24:19.624 --> 01:24:23.027
You listen to me. Your private life,
that's your own concern.

01:24:23.161 --> 01:24:27.532
But I'm here to see a bomber
and I'm damn sure gonna see it now!

01:24:27.665 --> 01:24:31.803
Look at this place. Don't you have
any pride? It looks like a damn pigsty!

01:24:33.304 --> 01:24:38.175
It's not my goddamn planet.
Understand, monkey boy?

01:24:39.143 --> 01:24:42.747
- Let's get outta here, O'Connor.
- But Whorfin said we could kill her.

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:05.836
(lectroid #5 growls)

01:25:13.209 --> 01:25:15.211
You owe me one, Buck.

01:25:22.885 --> 01:25:25.721
It's not over yet.

01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:29.792
I may be down but I'm not out.

01:25:35.898 --> 01:25:38.867
What is that? Don't pick it up. No.

01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:44.006
Penny.

01:25:45.174 --> 01:25:47.075
How's she doing?

01:25:47.209 --> 01:25:50.212
- I don't know.
- There's no overthruster.

01:25:50.345 --> 01:25:51.980
- Buckaroo Banzai!
- What?

01:25:52.114 --> 01:25:54.583
There is little time!

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:58.653
You better come quickly
if your planet is still important to you.

01:25:58.787 --> 01:26:02.257
Leave her to me.
You take care of business.

01:26:03.124 --> 01:26:04.793
Thanks.

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:06.995
- Go. Go.
- Right.

01:26:09.964 --> 01:26:13.468
- Where's Buckaroo Banzai?
- He's flown the coop.

01:26:13.601 --> 01:26:15.336
- Is the girl dead?
- Yes!

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:18.339
Then sound the call to board the ship.

01:26:18.472 --> 01:26:21.142
Without the crucial missing circuit,
we'll never make it!

01:26:21.275 --> 01:26:25.513
They're only monkey boys! We can still
crush them here on Earth, Lord Whorfin!

01:26:25.646 --> 01:26:28.616
No. It's time to go home.

01:26:28.749 --> 01:26:32.486
Bigbooty, you carry my overthruster.

01:26:32.619 --> 01:26:35.589
John O'Connor...

01:26:35.722 --> 01:26:38.158
you stick by my side.

01:26:45.899 --> 01:26:51.004
The great vehicle itself
is now in final boarding state.

01:26:51.137 --> 01:26:53.640
What is that?

01:26:54.507 --> 01:26:58.611
It's a troop ship. Lord Whorfin.

01:27:03.783 --> 01:27:07.119
Massacre them without quarter!

01:27:23.335 --> 01:27:28.774
Tell the flight attendants to close
the doors and prepare for a crosscheck.

01:27:38.416 --> 01:27:44.089
If you are not inside the great vehicle
itself, you have missed the boat.

01:27:46.691 --> 01:27:51.662
We are go for launch.
Do not obstruct the great vehicle.

01:27:53.531 --> 01:27:55.399
Do not take to the floor.

01:27:55.533 --> 01:27:59.370
Lord Whorfin will return
for all those left behind.

01:27:59.503 --> 01:28:04.909
Clear the great vehicle. Voltage is rising.
Electromagnetic field is rising.

01:28:10.614 --> 01:28:13.717
John O'Connor! Install my overthruster!

01:28:13.851 --> 01:28:17.254
...all carry-on baggage
overhead and secure.

01:28:17.387 --> 01:28:19.523
Electromagnetic field...

01:28:19.623 --> 01:28:24.628
- What is this?
- It looks like one of our thermopods.

01:28:24.761 --> 01:28:26.796
But it's a very bad design.

01:28:28.932 --> 01:28:34.804
Your tray tables are secure, and your
seat backs in the full upright position.

01:28:34.938 --> 01:28:38.141
Your overthruster
is in place, Lord Whorfin.

01:28:38.274 --> 01:28:40.510
It won't work! It won't work!

01:28:40.643 --> 01:28:43.746
Shut up, John Bigbooty, you coward!

01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:47.516
You're the weakest individual
I ever know!

01:28:48.584 --> 01:28:50.619
We are cooking. Over.

01:28:52.254 --> 01:28:56.458
Get away from that, boy,
or I'll drink your blood!

01:28:59.061 --> 01:29:02.698
What you got there, son?
That's not real, is it?

01:29:05.667 --> 01:29:06.535
Get 'em up.

01:29:06.668 --> 01:29:11.573
H2 tank pressurisation, OK.
We're go for launch.

01:29:11.673 --> 01:29:17.646
John Many Jars, establish overthruster
beam red. Over. Activate oscillator.

01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:22.350
Pace accelerator's shorting out!

01:29:22.484 --> 01:29:25.320
John O'Connor! My overthruster!

01:29:34.128 --> 01:29:37.832
Wait! Don't leave! Don't leave!

01:29:37.965 --> 01:29:40.835
This is vacuum cylinder three.

01:29:47.174 --> 01:29:50.811
If he can't connect the dots,
they never gonna penetrate.

01:29:53.814 --> 01:29:58.418
Cabin fluid valves were closed.
Problem is corrected. Over.

01:29:58.552 --> 01:29:59.553
What is that?

01:29:59.686 --> 01:30:03.056
Is OK. No worry.
Is an insulating liquid.

01:30:03.190 --> 01:30:05.759
Full speed ahead!

01:30:05.892 --> 01:30:09.663
May I remind you to fasten your seat belts

01:30:09.796 --> 01:30:12.732
and extinguish all smoking material.

01:30:12.866 --> 01:30:16.502
We haven't a chance!
Your overthruster's for shit!

01:30:16.636 --> 01:30:19.205
One more word out of you, Bigbooty...

01:30:19.339 --> 01:30:22.608
Bigbooté! Té! Té!

01:30:24.911 --> 01:30:28.981
Welcome aboard, Banzai. You're next.

01:30:31.183 --> 01:30:33.385
Let's go home.

01:30:41.393 --> 01:30:43.962
The wall is softening.

01:30:45.597 --> 01:30:49.234
- Inertial overtones obtaining command.
- Oh, no.

01:31:01.579 --> 01:31:06.918
Danger! Danger! We do not have
crossover. Negative mass is spreading.

01:31:13.858 --> 01:31:18.129
We're not in the Eighth Dimension.
We are over New Jersey.

01:31:18.262 --> 01:31:19.997
All is not lost...

01:31:20.131 --> 01:31:22.800
Stand by to incinerate Smolensk.

01:31:24.101 --> 01:31:25.469
Jettison!

01:31:25.603 --> 01:31:29.440
So sorry, gentlemen,
but I must dump the excess baggage.

01:31:34.411 --> 01:31:37.281
Arrivederci, Banzai!

01:31:38.982 --> 01:31:43.520
- Where's the power?
- I'm a diplomat! I failed flight school.

01:31:43.987 --> 01:31:46.122
What do we do, jump-start it?

01:32:12.448 --> 01:32:15.551
Rocket stabiliser.

01:32:15.684 --> 01:32:17.720
What this?

01:32:19.655 --> 01:32:21.690
Looks like a gun.

01:32:26.695 --> 01:32:29.031
John Parker, take this wheel.

01:32:32.334 --> 01:32:36.204
Right, just... just hold onto that.
It flies like a truck.

01:32:36.338 --> 01:32:38.306
Good. What is a truck?

01:32:38.406 --> 01:32:42.477
Electric beam is fine, Lord Whorfin.

01:33:03.531 --> 01:33:05.699
Thermopod on our tail. Over.

01:33:05.833 --> 01:33:09.370
Banzai! Oh, so you wanna play games?

01:33:09.503 --> 01:33:14.575
- Let's just stabilise her?
- Wanna play hide-and-seek? Huh?

01:33:14.708 --> 01:33:20.414
OK. OK. Start left. Go left. More, more,
more, more. Left, left. Left! I said left!

01:33:20.547 --> 01:33:23.283
- This is left!
- I mean my left. Go your right.

01:33:23.417 --> 01:33:24.651
Go.

01:33:24.784 --> 01:33:27.153
Feet, do your stuff!

01:33:27.287 --> 01:33:29.255
Faster! He's gaining.

01:33:29.389 --> 01:33:34.994
More, more, more. Lock in, lock in,
lock in. Now dive, dive, dive, dive, dive.

01:33:35.128 --> 01:33:37.997
Whorfin... sayonara.

01:33:40.266 --> 01:33:46.038
Banzai! I'll see you in hell!

01:33:47.373 --> 01:33:49.575
We've got him!

01:33:50.476 --> 01:33:52.945
- Pull up!
- It's stuck!

01:33:59.585 --> 01:34:01.954
John Whorfin... destroyed.

01:34:03.455 --> 01:34:05.657
Deactivate particle beam.

01:34:05.791 --> 01:34:10.128
Tracking 0-0-0.

01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:58.742
I thought you bought it.

01:34:58.875 --> 01:35:01.278
- Yeah, me too. Where's Penny?
- At the bus.

01:35:01.445 --> 01:35:03.547
New Jersey helped me bring her back.

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:06.249
- How is she?
- He said he'd pull her through.

01:35:06.383 --> 01:35:09.185
Quite a guy, if you want my opinion.

01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:11.755
You give me that gizmo

01:35:11.888 --> 01:35:17.393
and I'll give you a brand new
crisp $20 bill. Huh?

01:35:18.828 --> 01:35:23.066
- All right, I'll tell you what...
- Hey, Scooter! Fall in.

01:35:28.404 --> 01:35:31.273
This what you're looking for, Buckaroo?

01:35:32.608 --> 01:35:37.246
- Scooter... you got his job.
- All right!

01:35:37.379 --> 01:35:40.516
- Wanna ride with me in the jet car?
- Wow! You know.

01:35:40.716 --> 01:35:42.985
But I have to ask my dad first.

01:35:43.619 --> 01:35:46.488
OK, you ask your dad, I'll wash up.

01:35:50.959 --> 01:35:52.594
Aw.

01:35:58.333 --> 01:36:00.368
I did all I could.

01:36:03.705 --> 01:36:07.809
Buckaroo, President's on line one. Calling about is
everything OK with the alien space cloud,

01:36:07.942 --> 01:36:10.278
or should he go ahead
and destroy Russia?

01:36:10.411 --> 01:36:13.314
Tell him yes on one and no on two.

01:36:14.615 --> 01:36:18.085
Which was "yes"?
To destroy Russia or number two?

01:37:21.714 --> 01:37:23.348
Penny.

01:37:37.562 --> 01:37:39.597
Careful.

01:37:42.233 --> 01:37:44.269
You're all right.

01:37:47.672 --> 01:37:49.841
You look awful.

01:37:49.974 --> 01:37:55.112
You don't exactly light up
a party yourself... Penny Priddy.

01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:09.259
So what? Big deal!

01:38:14.364 --> 01:38:18.068
WATCH FOR THE NEXT ADVENTURE
OF BUCKAROO BANZAI

01:38:18.201 --> 01:38:23.440
