WEBVTT

00:05.086 --> 00:07.797
- Previously on Beyond...
- While you were in your coma,

00:07.798 --> 00:09.889
your mind traveled
to another world.

00:09.890 --> 00:12.052
- This is where we met.
- They call it The Realm.

00:12.053 --> 00:15.475
In case this place spontaneously
goes up in flames,

00:15.476 --> 00:17.477
you got my number.
Call me sometime.

00:17.478 --> 00:18.938
- I will.
- I'll see you, big brother.

00:18.939 --> 00:20.400
- Don't study too hard.
- You're the poor schmuck

00:20.401 --> 00:21.772
taking the High School
Equivalency.

00:23.144 --> 00:24.944
To control your outbursts,

00:24.945 --> 00:26.406
we need to get you to remember.

00:26.407 --> 00:28.568
Wake up!

00:28.569 --> 00:30.780
- You're okay.
- I never want to feel like that again.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.702
- Why me? You were a
witness to something

00:32.703 --> 00:34.114
- you should not have seen. No!

00:34.115 --> 00:36.035
- I'm saddled with
cleaning it up.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.577
Who's that?
He looks familiar.

00:37.578 --> 00:39.038
It's Kevin's brother,

00:39.039 --> 00:42.212
- the psycho that put you in a coma.
- Jeff.

00:42.213 --> 00:44.714
- We need to talk.
- What do you mean? About what?

00:44.715 --> 00:45.796
No!

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

01:00.521 --> 01:03.314
That is some hippie dippy
bull-crap right there.

01:05.736 --> 01:08.688
- What?
- The paperweight.

01:08.689 --> 01:11.651
My father-in-law gave
it to me for Christmas.

01:11.652 --> 01:14.694
- It's total nonsense.
- I like it.

01:14.695 --> 01:16.997
You would.

01:18.409 --> 01:20.580
Why do you keep changing
our appointment, Major?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.542
McArdle, I'm trying
to do you a favor

01:22.543 --> 01:25.165
with the desk assignment.
It's a cush job.

01:25.166 --> 01:27.587
I can't sit at a desk in Kansas.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.379
Don't you have
a brother in Fort Reed?

01:29.380 --> 01:32.051
Just take the assignment,
go look him up.

01:32.052 --> 01:34.765
I have to go where
the universe tells me,

01:35.806 --> 01:37.638
I can't be in Fort Reed.

01:40.221 --> 01:41.932
I'll get the forms.

01:44.145 --> 01:46.226
For 12 years, Holden Matthews

01:46.227 --> 01:47.647
has laid at county hospital

01:47.648 --> 01:49.939
in one of the longest
reported comas in history,

01:49.940 --> 01:52.992
and today that streak
has finally come to an end.

01:52.993 --> 01:55.945
Holden was discovered
awake in his bed at 7:15

01:55.946 --> 01:57.907
in the morning
by one of the on-duty nurses.

01:57.908 --> 01:59.999
We are being told
he's in stable condition.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.743
No word on whether he'll be
released in the coming weeks.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.845
You were out of it, man,

02:15.846 --> 02:17.518
like something was chasing you.

02:29.270 --> 02:32.863
What? You gonna steal
my gun and shoot me?

02:37.077 --> 02:40.039
It's empty. I'm not gonna
hurt you, Matthews.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.161
I just want to talk
to you for a minute,

02:42.162 --> 02:45.205
- then you can go.
- I'm supposed to believe you?

02:45.206 --> 02:47.587
- Believe what you want.
- I know who you are.

02:47.588 --> 02:49.209
You're Kevin's brother, Jeff.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.422
The last time we talked,
you ran me off the road.

02:52.423 --> 02:54.254
- You could have killed me.
- Yeah, but I didn't,

02:54.255 --> 02:55.885
got to count for something.

02:55.886 --> 02:57.638
What do you want?

03:00.180 --> 03:01.562
I want to find my brother.

03:04.895 --> 03:06.856
He and I hadn't talked in years,

03:06.857 --> 03:09.148
and two days ago,
he left me a voice mail.

03:09.149 --> 03:11.611
He was hysterical.
It was mostly inaudible.

03:11.612 --> 03:13.112
But I can make out one name:

03:13.113 --> 03:14.945
Holden.

03:16.737 --> 03:19.028
Got me worried, so then I checked
in with his wife, Christine.

03:19.029 --> 03:21.282
She got a weird call
from him too.

03:24.124 --> 03:26.085
Dropped in to his office,

03:26.086 --> 03:28.127
and I found his desk drawer
smashed to pieces.

03:28.128 --> 03:30.209
I'm talking forceful entry.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.001
Someone was looking
for something.

03:32.002 --> 03:35.214
God. Kevin.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.137
Now I need you to tell
me who this guy is.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.103
Where did you get this?

03:44.104 --> 03:46.185
I got a buddy
who works in security.

03:46.186 --> 03:48.147
The last time my brother
was caught on camera

03:48.148 --> 03:49.349
was a drive-through
on Fieldsman Road,

03:49.350 --> 03:51.561
and this son-of-a-bitch
was following him.

03:51.562 --> 03:54.063
- So who is he?
- I'm not sure.

03:54.064 --> 03:57.116
He found me after I woke up.

03:57.117 --> 03:59.118
He showed up with a bunch
of thugs, threatened us.

03:59.119 --> 04:01.240
Kevin got mixed up
with them somehow.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.953
Look, I told all of this
to the Sheriff.

04:03.954 --> 04:06.165
Christine already filed
a missing person's report.

04:06.166 --> 04:07.867
They're looking for Kevin,

04:07.868 --> 04:10.500
but so far they've got nothing,

04:10.501 --> 04:13.003
and you can't tell me
anything else?

04:18.298 --> 04:20.971
Hey, hey, are you all right?

04:22.142 --> 04:23.222
- I've got to go.
- No, wait a minute.

04:23.223 --> 04:26.015
- We're not done here, Matthews.
- Let the sheriff do his job.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.978
They'll find Kevin.

04:37.197 --> 04:39.199
- Hey.
- Holden?

04:40.951 --> 04:43.613
- What's wrong?
- They won't go away,

04:43.614 --> 04:45.114
the visions.

04:45.115 --> 04:47.286
Okay, calm down.
What do you see?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.579
I don't know!
Some freak with no face

04:49.580 --> 04:50.961
and it follows me.

04:52.002 --> 04:53.212
And I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

04:53.213 --> 04:55.795
- I don't know what to do and I...
- Okay.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.757
Come here.
Sit down.

04:57.758 --> 04:59.089
Okay.

05:00.971 --> 05:02.221
You may be experiencing

05:02.222 --> 05:04.224
a sort of
post-traumatic stress.

05:06.186 --> 05:07.807
It's a very typical response

05:07.808 --> 05:09.268
to recalling repressed memories.

05:09.269 --> 05:11.190
You think these are typical?

05:11.191 --> 05:14.814
Look, the next time you
feel your heart pounding,

05:14.815 --> 05:18.107
or your face getting hot,
just close your eyes

05:18.108 --> 05:19.610
and focus on your breathing.

05:20.611 --> 05:21.612
Okay.

05:22.743 --> 05:24.114
Try it now.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.750
Focus on making
your breaths even,

05:30.751 --> 05:32.413
controlled.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.456
Don't resist,

05:36.457 --> 05:38.297
just let it wash over you.

05:38.298 --> 05:40.299
Accept it.

05:40.300 --> 05:42.302
Just breathe.

05:44.054 --> 05:46.225
Good.

05:46.226 --> 05:47.598
That's good.

05:52.312 --> 05:54.184
How are you feeling?

05:55.736 --> 05:58.067
Better.

05:58.068 --> 05:59.359
Neat trick.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.403
I do a lot of yoga.

06:05.195 --> 06:07.157
We can pick up
where we left off.

06:09.039 --> 06:11.491
No, I...
No, I... I...

06:11.492 --> 06:13.913
- I'm just gonna go.
- These visions

06:13.914 --> 06:15.084
will keep coming
unless you can remember

06:15.085 --> 06:16.295
how to control them.

06:16.296 --> 06:18.458
Then why is it the more
I remember, the worse they get?

06:18.459 --> 06:21.130
Because it takes time
and practice.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.672
Great, well, I'll practice

06:22.673 --> 06:24.383
the whole PTSD breathing thing

06:24.384 --> 06:26.215
while you figure out a way
to retrieve my memories

06:26.216 --> 06:28.097
without turning me
into a Popsicle, okay?

06:28.098 --> 06:29.099
Holden.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.482
Hello?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.297
What happened, Daniel?
How is he?

06:58.298 --> 06:59.879
Stabilized.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.302
His vitals just started falling.
I'm not sure why.

07:04.965 --> 07:07.256
- What's going on in there?
- I haven't gotten a word from him

07:07.257 --> 07:08.719
since it happened.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.052
- He's not communicating?
- Mh-mmm.

07:14.264 --> 07:16.686
Vitals are low.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.938
Are you seeing rapid
saccadic eye movement?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.981
Same as usual, if not increased.

07:24.695 --> 07:27.067
He's in a drift.

07:28.989 --> 07:30.950
I thought drifting
was theoretical.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.163
All of this is theoretical.

07:38.749 --> 07:42.212
If you can hear me,
say something.

07:48.849 --> 07:50.510
Please.

07:50.511 --> 07:53.013
I can't lose you in there.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.019
So I heard you ran out

08:00.020 --> 08:01.651
of the High School
Equivalency Test

08:01.652 --> 08:03.192
like a bat out of hell.

08:03.193 --> 08:06.025
No one likes
taking tests, right?

08:06.026 --> 08:07.196
Well, when I was a kid, honey,

08:07.197 --> 08:09.068
tests used to
give me stomachaches.

08:09.069 --> 08:11.160
Mom, you're doing
that social worker thing...

08:11.161 --> 08:12.822
That thing where you
try to make it seem like

08:12.823 --> 08:14.453
it's my idea
to talk about my feelings.

08:14.454 --> 08:16.415
It's usually undetectable.

08:16.416 --> 08:18.168
I must be out of practice.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.212
You want to talk about your
boyfriend, Pastor Ian?

08:23.213 --> 08:25.464
My boyfriend?
What am I? Fourteen?

08:25.465 --> 08:27.176
Well, what would you call
the guy you're seeing

08:27.177 --> 08:28.507
who isn't my dad?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.429
A good friend.

08:30.430 --> 08:32.431
Pastor Ian's a good man.

08:32.432 --> 08:35.304
Look, I know a lot has
changed, and I can't begin

08:35.304 --> 08:37.056
to understand
how it makes you feel,

08:37.057 --> 08:39.138
but all I ask is that
you give him a chance.

08:39.139 --> 08:40.851
Honey, give me a chance.

08:42.352 --> 08:43.982
Okay.

08:43.984 --> 08:45.775
Is there anything else

08:45.776 --> 08:47.316
you guys have
been keeping from me?

08:47.317 --> 08:49.148
I think your brother
used your coma

08:49.149 --> 08:50.951
as an excuse to meet girls.

08:52.322 --> 08:55.074
Yeah, well,
I'd be mad if he didn't.

08:55.075 --> 08:56.616
So could you.

08:56.617 --> 08:59.538
Any young lady would be
lucky to spend an evening

08:59.539 --> 09:01.330
staring across
a candle-lit dinner

09:01.331 --> 09:03.122
at that handsome face of yours.

09:03.123 --> 09:04.253
Mom!

09:04.254 --> 09:07.587
Hello, Jamie?
This is Holden Matthews.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.719
You might remember me
from such things

09:09.720 --> 09:10.880
as the party the other day,

09:10.881 --> 09:11.931
where the house burned down,

09:11.932 --> 09:13.633
and the store.

09:13.634 --> 09:15.676
It's terrible.
It's terrible.

09:18.138 --> 09:20.139
Just call her.
Just...

09:20.140 --> 09:22.022
call her.

09:25.646 --> 09:27.688
Okay.

09:28.949 --> 09:30.820
- Hi.
- Jamie!

09:30.821 --> 09:33.572
- Hey, it's Holden Matthews.
- Sorry I missed your call.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.075
Leave your info,
and I'll ring you back.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.196
Jamie...

09:37.197 --> 09:39.078
- sorry I missed you.
- At the tone,

09:39.079 --> 09:40.459
please leave your message.

09:40.460 --> 09:42.121
When you're finished recording,

09:42.122 --> 09:44.463
you may hang up or press 1
for more options.

09:44.464 --> 09:46.005
Hey, Jamie...

09:46.006 --> 09:49.378
Uh, Jamie, Hey, it's Holden.

09:49.379 --> 09:51.671
I was just wondering
if maybe you'd like

09:51.672 --> 09:53.133
to do someth...

09:57.137 --> 10:00.099
- Hello?
- Uh, sorry, hello?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.851
- Hello?
- Jamie, hey!

10:01.852 --> 10:03.142
It's... it's Holden.

10:03.143 --> 10:04.774
Hey, um, I'm sorry.

10:04.775 --> 10:07.026
I didn't get my phone in time.

10:07.027 --> 10:10.149
I kind of thought
you'd just text me.

10:10.150 --> 10:12.401
Shoot, is calling weird?

10:12.402 --> 10:15.194
- Should I have just, um...
- Oh, no, no no, no, it's okay.

10:15.195 --> 10:18.368
I know that you're still like
catching up on everything.

10:19.700 --> 10:22.832
- So what's up?
- Uh...

10:22.833 --> 10:25.504
I just wanted to see
what you were up to.

10:25.505 --> 10:28.338
I'm just coming back from class.

10:30.050 --> 10:31.672
Cool, that's cool.

10:35.515 --> 10:37.176
Um...

10:37.177 --> 10:39.389
Well, I was just, um...

10:41.221 --> 10:44.353
I wanted to see if maybe
you'd want to do something.

10:44.354 --> 10:47.818
I would love to do something
with you, Holden.

10:49.820 --> 10:51.861
Awesome.
That's great!

10:51.862 --> 10:54.483
So what do you want to do?

10:54.484 --> 10:56.736
Something easy, maybe?

10:56.737 --> 10:58.407
Right, yeah, something easy,

10:58.408 --> 11:01.200
like, uh, how about
dinner tomorrow?

11:01.201 --> 11:03.622
Dinner sounds great.

11:03.623 --> 11:05.084
Awesome.

11:05.085 --> 11:07.417
Uh, we can do something
besides making out this time.

11:11.131 --> 11:14.845
But making out
is still on the table, right?

11:16.136 --> 11:17.927
Of course.
Yeah!

11:17.928 --> 11:19.258
Yeah, of course.

11:19.259 --> 11:23.012
Okay, awesome.
I will see you then.

11:23.013 --> 11:26.066
Great, I will
see you... then.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.231
Hmm.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.920
What are you doing here?

11:50.921 --> 11:53.212
I heard it chugging a
little the other day,

11:53.213 --> 11:54.964
and I wanted
to diagnose the problem.

11:54.965 --> 11:57.636
I'll be out of your hair soon.

11:57.637 --> 12:00.180
No, it's nice of you...

12:01.181 --> 12:02.892
but I don't even like him
riding this thing

12:02.893 --> 12:05.185
- in the first place,
so I'd apprec...

12:12.272 --> 12:14.193
You got to be kidding me.

12:14.194 --> 12:15.405
Tom, come on, please don't...

12:20.240 --> 12:22.202
Great.

12:26.626 --> 12:28.167
Morning,
Mr. Matthews.

12:28.168 --> 12:29.368
What the hell
are you doing here?

12:29.369 --> 12:31.170
I'm just here to talk
to Holden, all right?

12:31.171 --> 12:33.042
Listen, I thought I made it
pretty clear what would happen

12:33.043 --> 12:34.924
- the next time you came near my family.
- Look, I'm not here

12:34.925 --> 12:37.296
- to fight you.
- Then just keep on driving, Jeff.

12:37.297 --> 12:38.838
- Hey, what's going on?
- Nothing.

12:38.839 --> 12:40.759
- Jeff was just leaving.
- I have to talk to you, all right?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.761
Hey! Didn't you hear me?
I said get off my property.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.383
Dad, look, it's okay.

12:44.384 --> 12:46.515
Just go, it's okay.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.148
He just wants to apologize.

12:53.984 --> 12:56.275
Hey, you need to come with me...

12:56.276 --> 12:58.448
- Jeff...
- or Kevin's as good as dead.

12:59.990 --> 13:02.492
This guy in the yellow jacket,
he's a professional.

13:03.954 --> 13:05.575
My brother didn't
even have a chance.

13:07.998 --> 13:09.869
Hey!

13:09.870 --> 13:11.620
Didn't you say
he came after you,

13:11.621 --> 13:14.083
held a gun to my brother's head?

13:14.084 --> 13:15.374
If he's willing to go that far,

13:15.375 --> 13:16.755
do you really think
he's gonna leave

13:16.756 --> 13:18.548
you and your family alone?

13:22.923 --> 13:24.684
What am I supposed to do?

13:26.136 --> 13:28.057
Meet me down the road
in 15 minutes.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.810
I got something
I need to show you.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.151
So why are we here?

13:42.903 --> 13:45.364
That house belongs
to Jack Churchill.

13:45.365 --> 13:47.786
Do you recognize the name?

13:47.787 --> 13:49.289
Should I?

13:51.211 --> 13:54.003
He's a famous British
soldier from World War II,

13:54.004 --> 13:56.005
one of the greatest
soldiers of all time.

13:56.006 --> 13:57.957
Okay, well, anything past
7th grade history,

13:57.958 --> 14:01.090
- I sort of missed.
- It's an alias...

14:01.091 --> 14:03.223
for Yellow Jacket.

14:05.765 --> 14:07.887
No, we're at his house?

14:07.888 --> 14:09.178
Whoa, whoa,
relax, Matthews. Look.

14:09.179 --> 14:12.641
I mean, there's kids
playing in sprinklers,

14:12.642 --> 14:14.063
families walking their doggies.

14:14.064 --> 14:16.105
No one's gonna hurt you.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.277
How did you even find him?

14:18.278 --> 14:19.778
Well, it wasn't easy.

14:19.779 --> 14:22.191
No social media,
no criminal record,

14:22.192 --> 14:24.243
but after some digging,

14:24.244 --> 14:27.156
I found out that all his documentation
appeared out of thin air

14:27.157 --> 14:28.827
a year ago.

14:28.828 --> 14:30.490
I'm sure he has
other aliases too.

14:31.952 --> 14:33.622
You know what else he has?

14:33.623 --> 14:35.455
A daughter...

14:37.207 --> 14:38.667
with medical records...

14:38.668 --> 14:40.459
school records,

14:40.460 --> 14:43.053
which led me to this address.

14:44.094 --> 14:47.177
- You need a minute?
- No, um...

14:48.888 --> 14:50.810
What are we doing here, exactly?

14:51.851 --> 14:54.013
His kid's got
a piano recital tonight.

14:54.014 --> 14:56.015
So when they leave, we go in.

14:56.016 --> 14:59.689
We're breaking into his house
in broad daylight?

15:00.690 --> 15:02.111
We need proof,

15:02.112 --> 15:03.943
something tying him to Kevin.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.734
Jeff, I'm not a detective

15:05.735 --> 15:08.447
- or ex-military...
- I'll guide you through it.

15:08.448 --> 15:10.579
All right?

15:10.580 --> 15:12.912
Baby's first B&E.

15:17.207 --> 15:19.748
Dad, I'm hanging up.

15:19.749 --> 15:21.591
Goodbye.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.045
Holden problems again?

15:26.386 --> 15:28.177
Yeah, I'm glad
he's okay and everything,

15:28.178 --> 15:30.309
but, man, my parents
need to lay off.

15:30.310 --> 15:33.102
Didn't he wake up from a
coma, like, yesterday?

15:33.103 --> 15:35.814
Look, I'm not saying
that we should forget

15:35.815 --> 15:37.226
like the whole thing
ever happened.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.188
I'm just saying that
maybe we don't need

15:39.189 --> 15:41.900
to call a family meeting every
single time Holden leaves the house.

15:41.901 --> 15:43.692
You know, for someone
who hates how people

15:43.693 --> 15:45.524
won't shut up about his brother,

15:45.525 --> 15:47.988
you sure won't shut up
about your brother.

15:49.279 --> 15:50.950
You're right.

15:57.747 --> 15:59.669
So what are you in the mood for?

16:00.840 --> 16:03.583
Something... orange.

16:05.215 --> 16:07.217
Something orange
coming right up.

16:29.529 --> 16:30.949
Get down.

16:30.950 --> 16:32.612
- That's him.
- I know.

16:57.137 --> 16:58.978
All right, let's move.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.233
Matthews!
Look, I need you.

17:04.233 --> 17:06.025
I can't do this, Jeff.

17:11.491 --> 17:14.913
Look, a few weeks ago, I was
ready to leave this town again,

17:14.914 --> 17:16.325
then...

17:16.326 --> 17:18.537
Then the universe
gave me a sign.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.329
You woke up.

17:20.329 --> 17:22.161
Look, our lives
are intertwined...

17:22.162 --> 17:26.625
Yours, mine, my brother's,
and this Churchill guy...

17:26.626 --> 17:28.426
And it's gonna stay that
way until we take him

17:28.428 --> 17:30.089
and his people down.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.801
You with me?

17:34.594 --> 17:36.095
Good.

17:36.096 --> 17:38.437
Now let's go.

17:38.438 --> 17:40.059
Quick.

17:44.394 --> 17:46.064
All right, universe,

17:46.065 --> 17:48.067
I hope you're on my side.

18:00.460 --> 18:03.162
Hey!
Did you see the sign?

18:03.163 --> 18:05.834
There should be
chloroform in the bag.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.046
Chloroform?
Won't that hurt it?

18:08.047 --> 18:10.710
I prefer the term
"neutralize."

18:12.512 --> 18:15.094
All right.

18:18.718 --> 18:21.811
Wow, a real killer
we've got here.

18:23.062 --> 18:25.394
- Am I supposed to...
- No, Matthews.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.606
He's a teddy bear
that poops. Come on.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.818
Hurry up.

18:30.650 --> 18:33.363
Grab my camera.
No, here, give me that.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.034
Here, we need intel,

18:36.035 --> 18:37.866
anything that looks interesting.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.908
I'm gonna go plant some bugs

18:39.909 --> 18:41.370
- while you go and do that.
- Okay.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.081
Do you know
when he's coming back?

18:43.082 --> 18:45.295
Nope, so work fast.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.300
Hmm.

19:09.269 --> 19:11.029
Here we go.

19:11.030 --> 19:13.442
His phone...
What'd I tell you?

19:13.443 --> 19:15.113
The universe has
a way of showing you

19:15.114 --> 19:16.865
which direction to go.

19:16.866 --> 19:19.988
What are you doing?

19:19.989 --> 19:21.991
Cloning the contents
of his phone.

19:23.333 --> 19:25.773
We better get going. He's gonna
be coming back for this thing.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.712
What do you think
he's got in there?

19:37.507 --> 19:39.219
Damn it.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.670
- Nothing here.
- Yeah, I doubt that.

20:24.013 --> 20:25.554
You got something?

20:25.555 --> 20:27.145
Uh, just some trash.

20:27.146 --> 20:29.979
A zip tie, I think.

20:33.853 --> 20:37.196
- Come on, this isn't proof.
- Proof? No.

20:38.197 --> 20:39.858
Likely?

20:39.859 --> 20:41.781
My brother was here.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.293
- Hey, hey, hey. You okay?
- Yeah, I'll be okay.

20:54.874 --> 20:55.965
Don't resist.

20:57.006 --> 20:58.758
Just let it wash over you.

21:00.049 --> 21:01.641
Just breathe.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.392
It happened again, didn't it?

21:13.443 --> 21:16.856
- You're having some kind of flashback or...
- I'm... I'm... I'm fine.

21:17.987 --> 21:20.360
If you're right.
We have to nail this bastard.

21:22.572 --> 21:23.993
Let's get back up there.

21:36.005 --> 21:38.176
Go and check out upstairs.
I got this.

21:38.177 --> 21:39.177
Okay.

22:02.071 --> 22:05.034
Holden!
Holden, we got to go!

22:11.250 --> 22:13.042
Come on, come on, come on.

22:47.036 --> 22:48.617
Spartacus.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.198
Where are you, buddy?

22:50.199 --> 22:53.663
Shh! Shh!

22:55.164 --> 22:56.415
Spartacus?

22:56.416 --> 22:59.839
Shut up! Shh!

23:06.055 --> 23:08.597
You're losing control, Holden.

23:08.598 --> 23:10.058
Fight it.

23:10.059 --> 23:11.771
Ow.

23:22.191 --> 23:23.192
Fight it!

23:52.051 --> 23:54.012
Willa.

23:54.013 --> 23:55.604
You've been here for hours

23:55.605 --> 23:57.145
and Arthur's condition
hasn't changed.

23:57.146 --> 23:58.517
Why don't you get some rest?

23:58.518 --> 24:01.190
I don't need rest.

24:02.191 --> 24:03.902
I need to get back
into The Realm.

24:03.903 --> 24:06.024
I'm not inducing you
into another coma.

24:06.025 --> 24:08.066
It's too traumatic.

24:08.067 --> 24:09.828
Since when did you
have the authority

24:09.829 --> 24:11.159
to order me around, Daniel?

24:11.160 --> 24:14.333
Since your grandfather tasked
me with looking after you both.

24:17.707 --> 24:19.288
I know what
you must be thinking.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.341
My focus should
be on the mission,

24:23.342 --> 24:25.423
but you and I both know

24:25.424 --> 24:27.176
there's another way to save you.

24:29.138 --> 24:30.889
He's crashing!

24:30.890 --> 24:32.802
Step away, please.

24:38.057 --> 24:39.559
Willow, wait!

24:40.600 --> 24:41.981
Damn it.

24:57.917 --> 24:59.287
Okay.

24:59.288 --> 25:01.210
Please work.

25:02.291 --> 25:04.754
I need you to work.

25:18.397 --> 25:19.728
Willa!

25:19.729 --> 25:21.189
Get out of there!

25:21.190 --> 25:23.442
Don't!

25:33.362 --> 25:36.454
Oh, okay.
Okay, Just relax.

25:36.455 --> 25:39.869
- Shh. Just breathe.
- Okay.

25:41.160 --> 25:43.252
We might be getting some
interference from the bugs.

25:44.794 --> 25:47.335
Sent the info from Churchill's
phone to a buddy of mine.

25:47.336 --> 25:49.047
What can he do?

25:49.048 --> 25:51.049
You ever heard
of Edward Snowden?

25:51.050 --> 25:53.052
Uh, the football player?

25:56.265 --> 25:58.056
These days finding
information on people

25:58.057 --> 25:59.437
is a piece of cake.

25:59.438 --> 26:00.940
Everyone is connected.

26:02.061 --> 26:05.063
Do you... do you really
think the universe

26:05.064 --> 26:07.186
shows you where to go?

26:11.821 --> 26:14.112
The universe has a way
of course correcting.

26:14.113 --> 26:17.456
It talks to you. It tells you the
path that you're meant to take.

26:18.748 --> 26:20.248
You just got
to know when to listen.

26:20.249 --> 26:21.751
Hmm.

26:29.128 --> 26:30.128
Hey.

26:33.552 --> 26:35.014
Have you ever seen this?

26:52.652 --> 26:54.993
"The world before me
came into focus,

26:54.994 --> 26:58.787
"and only then did I
realize it was hollow.

26:58.788 --> 27:00.659
"Only then was I free
to cast my eyes upward,

27:00.660 --> 27:02.001
to the sky..."

27:35.194 --> 27:37.035
I've heard horror stories

27:37.036 --> 27:39.077
where people leave their wallet,

27:39.078 --> 27:41.119
and all the important things
are taken out of it.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.701
And so I'm not even gonna check

27:42.702 --> 27:44.953
'cause I can look at
your face and know,

27:44.954 --> 27:46.044
so thank you so much.

27:46.045 --> 27:47.585
What an honest and lovely man.

27:47.586 --> 27:50.668
I'm... I'm sure it is.

27:50.669 --> 27:53.132
Can I give you anything?

27:54.213 --> 27:57.055
Thank you. Clearly, my
mind's been other places.

27:57.056 --> 27:59.388
But I have never
done that, I swear.

28:01.010 --> 28:04.102
I hope it's... Well,
come on in, sleepyhead.

28:04.103 --> 28:06.805
I want you to meet...
Oh, I'm so sorry.

28:06.806 --> 28:10.568
What's your name again?
Mr. Jones?

28:10.569 --> 28:12.441
Please, call me David.

28:23.452 --> 28:26.584
Apparently, I forgot my
wallet at the grocery store

28:26.585 --> 28:28.166
and David found it.

28:28.167 --> 28:29.287
Most people would
have tossed it.

28:29.288 --> 28:31.589
My mother didn't
raise me that way, Diane.

28:31.590 --> 28:34.002
- Oh, excuse me for a moment.

28:34.003 --> 28:37.296
Holden, will you entertain
our guest until I get back?

28:43.142 --> 28:45.393
Your mom's a lovely woman.

28:45.394 --> 28:47.726
You really are blessed.

28:49.648 --> 28:51.900
She told me all about you,
about your brother, Luke,

28:51.901 --> 28:54.193
- at college.
- What are you doing here?

28:55.314 --> 28:56.856
Hmm.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.781
It's a cute dog.

29:02.782 --> 29:04.742
Golden Retriever, right?

29:04.743 --> 29:08.167
A well-behaved breed, loyal.

29:09.288 --> 29:10.628
That picture's got
to be... what...

29:10.629 --> 29:13.042
12 years old?
It's pre-coma, huh?

29:17.176 --> 29:19.428
You missed the chance
to see your dog off.

29:21.180 --> 29:24.092
Always hurts when
you lose the ones you love,

29:24.093 --> 29:26.184
but it doesn't
have to be that way.

29:26.185 --> 29:28.386
Death can be a beginning.

29:28.387 --> 29:32.271
Get out of my house, now.

29:38.027 --> 29:41.159
When you're ready,
come talk to me,

29:41.160 --> 29:43.362
and we can stop
playing this little game.

29:54.333 --> 29:55.915
Oh.

29:57.006 --> 29:59.678
By the way, you forgot these.

30:03.382 --> 30:06.095
It seems I've got a bug problem.

30:07.977 --> 30:09.187
How about from now on,

30:09.188 --> 30:11.230
we leave our families
out of this?

30:14.023 --> 30:15.143
Oh, are you leaving?

30:15.144 --> 30:17.435
Yeah, I better get a move on.

30:17.436 --> 30:18.736
- Okay.
- Thank you for the tea.

30:18.737 --> 30:20.738
- Hm-hmm, pleasure.
- Now you keep an eye

30:20.739 --> 30:22.240
on that wallet
from here on out, okay?

30:22.241 --> 30:23.863
I will, David.
Thank you.

30:27.076 --> 30:28.998
Nice to meet you, Holden.

30:33.002 --> 30:35.374
- I'll show you out, David.
- Thank you.

31:02.571 --> 31:04.152
Not gonna get my deposit back

31:04.153 --> 31:05.863
if you keep knocking like that.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.076
How do I use my abilities
against someone?

31:08.077 --> 31:10.118
Against someone?

31:10.119 --> 31:11.199
Yeah, the melting, burning,

31:11.200 --> 31:12.661
making people
fly through the air.

31:13.832 --> 31:15.373
Come on, I'm ready for
my training montage,

31:15.374 --> 31:17.835
the lifting tires,
leaping over cornfields.

31:17.836 --> 31:19.707
Your abilities
only matter in The Realm.

31:19.708 --> 31:21.259
The things you can
do in this world,

31:21.260 --> 31:23.461
they're not powers,
they're consequences.

31:23.462 --> 31:25.803
That's not good enough!
I... look,

31:25.804 --> 31:28.217
The Realm is behind me.
I don't care.

31:29.638 --> 31:32.100
Listen, the guy
in the yellow jacket...

31:32.101 --> 31:34.602
That guy who shot at us...
He came to my house.

31:34.603 --> 31:38.187
- He what?
- He threatened my mom and my brother.

31:39.188 --> 31:40.939
Kevin's missing,

31:40.940 --> 31:43.191
and I know this guy
is somehow responsible.

31:43.192 --> 31:45.984
All I have to go on
are these stupid aliases:

31:45.985 --> 31:48.446
a Jack Churchill, David Jones.

31:48.447 --> 31:50.239
Who the hell is this guy?

31:51.580 --> 31:52.910
I don't know.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.662
That night at the bar was
the first time I saw him.

31:54.663 --> 31:57.085
Willa, it's not a coincidence
you both showed up in my life

31:57.086 --> 31:58.796
after I woke up from my coma.

31:58.797 --> 32:00.878
I didn't just show up
in your life, Holden.

32:00.879 --> 32:03.211
I've known you
for a very long time.

32:03.212 --> 32:05.133
Then why won't you help me?

32:05.134 --> 32:06.714
Because this isn't you!

32:06.715 --> 32:09.008
The Holden I know
isn't some vigilante.

32:10.219 --> 32:12.220
And what is your plan,
exactly, huh?

32:12.221 --> 32:13.811
You're gonna find this guy

32:13.812 --> 32:15.013
and throw him through a window?

32:15.014 --> 32:16.935
You gonna set him on fire?

32:20.149 --> 32:22.520
I need to take this.

32:22.521 --> 32:24.903
Hello?

32:26.065 --> 32:27.946
Yeah.

32:46.545 --> 32:49.588
If I could get you to sign an
affidavit of confirmation...

32:51.510 --> 32:53.552
I need to talk to the sheriff.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.514
Oh, I know.
It's just awful.

32:56.515 --> 32:58.396
I'll meet you at the house.

32:58.397 --> 33:00.189
Bye, Hun.

33:02.061 --> 33:03.941
Oh, I just heard about Kevin.

33:03.942 --> 33:05.604
Honey, I'm so sorry.

33:07.066 --> 33:09.237
I'm gonna go to Christine's.
You want to come?

33:09.238 --> 33:11.070
Yeah, yeah, I do.

33:12.071 --> 33:15.073
Okay. Thank god they found
the guy who did this.

33:15.074 --> 33:17.115
They have somebody
in questioning right now.

33:17.116 --> 33:18.997
They have? Who?

33:20.249 --> 33:22.041
I think his name was Churchill.

33:24.833 --> 33:26.214
I'm going down to the station

33:26.215 --> 33:27.926
to give a statement.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.890
I'm sorry, Sheriff,
I'm not quite sure

33:32.891 --> 33:34.093
how to answer your questions.

33:36.225 --> 33:39.057
Security footage shows
you and the victim's

33:39.058 --> 33:41.350
general vicinity
the last time he was seen.

33:46.405 --> 33:47.986
Hmm.

33:50.649 --> 33:53.111
Did you bring this lady in yet?

33:53.112 --> 33:55.072
By your logic, she was
following the poor guy too.

33:59.498 --> 34:02.210
Sheriff, I mean this in the
most respectful way possible,

34:02.211 --> 34:05.333
but Fort Reed's a small town.

34:05.334 --> 34:07.755
I mean, you've got the
only Spangles for miles.

34:07.756 --> 34:11.668
As far as I know, it's not a
crime to crave a Tornado Shake.

34:11.670 --> 34:14.011
Right.

34:14.012 --> 34:16.844
We have a witness
who named you as a suspect.

34:18.226 --> 34:19.228
Why would they do that?

34:20.809 --> 34:22.059
The Matthews boy was in here

34:22.060 --> 34:23.271
talking to you, wasn't he?

34:23.272 --> 34:25.103
No.

34:26.185 --> 34:28.235
His buddy then, handsome
guy with a scar.

34:28.237 --> 34:29.688
Military, I'd wager.

34:33.322 --> 34:36.194
Look, I volunteer at County
Hospital in the coma ward.

34:36.195 --> 34:37.905
The staff knows me.

34:37.906 --> 34:39.998
I was there after
Holden Matthews woke up and...

34:42.201 --> 34:44.161
You know, maybe I shouldn't say.
I can't prove anything.

34:44.163 --> 34:46.004
His family's been
through so much.

34:48.917 --> 34:51.589
I'm afraid he might have
developed a fixation on me.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.842
I think him and his buddy
broke into my house yesterday.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.264
The door was unlocked.

34:56.264 --> 34:58.055
Someone rifled
through my things.

34:58.056 --> 35:00.269
My little girl Emily
had to sleep with the lights on.

35:05.434 --> 35:07.646
I'm sorry.
Am I under arrest?

35:09.438 --> 35:10.859
No.

35:13.282 --> 35:17.286
That is a relief, because I have
to pick Emily up from school.

35:23.912 --> 35:25.704
Hold up, I'll walk you out.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.822
No way.

36:40.369 --> 36:41.950
Hey!

36:43.161 --> 36:44.453
What did you say to them?

36:45.454 --> 36:46.915
Holden...

36:48.997 --> 36:50.788
The sheriff told me
what happened to your friend.

36:50.789 --> 36:52.089
If you wanted something from me,

36:52.090 --> 36:53.711
why didn't you just talk to me?

36:53.712 --> 36:56.424
Why couldn't you just leave
everyone else out of this?

36:56.425 --> 36:58.095
Well, he's in a much better
place right now.

36:58.096 --> 37:00.217
The people I work for
have access

37:00.218 --> 37:02.298
- to make that happen.
- Just admit what you've done!

37:05.183 --> 37:07.184
- Whatever happened
to your friend,

37:07.185 --> 37:08.557
he brought that upon himself.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.059
You're lying!

37:12.851 --> 37:15.354
Admit it!
Admit it!

37:16.905 --> 37:18.115
Admit it!

37:18.116 --> 37:20.158
You killed him!

37:21.360 --> 37:22.491
Admit it!

37:27.125 --> 37:28.917
You killed him!

37:34.252 --> 37:36.965
Why aren't you fighting back?

37:39.878 --> 37:42.050
You're too important.

38:07.536 --> 38:08.997
McArdle?

38:12.621 --> 38:13.961
Yo, McArdle.

38:13.962 --> 38:15.213
It's me. You here?

38:26.054 --> 38:27.225
Whew.

38:29.097 --> 38:30.097
Wow.

38:31.770 --> 38:33.392
What are you
doing here, Ramirez?

38:35.394 --> 38:37.315
I'm real sorry to hear
about your brother.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.898
You want to hear what I found

38:40.899 --> 38:42.579
from this Churchill guy's
call list or not?

38:46.204 --> 38:47.996
All right, hit me.

38:48.997 --> 38:50.078
Okay.

38:56.044 --> 38:57.625
I cross-referenced
a couple of the names

38:57.626 --> 38:59.166
you gave me from the phone.

38:59.167 --> 39:01.218
They led to an investment firm,

39:01.219 --> 39:03.841
a publishing company,
and a plastics company,

39:03.842 --> 39:05.302
but they're all
under the umbrella

39:05.303 --> 39:07.676
of an entity called Hollow Sky.

39:09.177 --> 39:11.099
"The world before me
came into focus..."

39:12.391 --> 39:14.682
Now there's another organization
with the same name.

39:14.683 --> 39:17.184
It's categorized
as a 501-C-3.

39:17.185 --> 39:19.106
- A tax-exempt organization.
- Right.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.738
This one's religious.

39:20.739 --> 39:22.650
I've heard the name before too.

39:22.651 --> 39:24.152
They prey on military veterans.

39:26.324 --> 39:27.866
There's one more thing.

39:37.335 --> 39:39.998
- Who am I looking at?
- Tess Shoemacher.

39:41.460 --> 39:43.211
CFO of Hollow Sky.

39:45.213 --> 39:46.555
Might be a good place to start.

39:49.137 --> 39:51.139
Thanks for coming
to see me, Ramirez.

39:54.312 --> 39:57.685
So, what? You think your brother
got mixed up with a cult?

39:57.686 --> 40:00.519
No, Kevin was
too smart for that.

40:01.860 --> 40:03.191
That was his problem.

40:10.288 --> 40:11.289
Hey...

40:13.371 --> 40:14.703
be careful, will you?

40:16.034 --> 40:18.036
It's like your
paperweight says...

40:19.167 --> 40:20.839
the universe
will take care of it.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.526
You can't control him.

40:48.527 --> 40:50.908
- Let go!
- You see what he did.

40:50.909 --> 40:52.240
The kid's a time bomb

40:53.241 --> 40:55.162
and the old man doesn't
have the best track record

40:55.163 --> 40:56.124
with dealing with
people like him.

40:56.125 --> 40:57.495
Don't pretend like
you know anything!

40:57.496 --> 41:00.248
Have you ever asked him
what happened with the others?

41:02.671 --> 41:03.882
Do you even know?

41:06.424 --> 41:08.466
You can't hold onto him, kiddo.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.218
Holden's destiny
is to change the world.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.260
He'll find that out

41:13.261 --> 41:15.223
and Frost's people
will be there to swoop in.

41:27.445 --> 41:29.406
What's going on in here?

41:29.407 --> 41:30.868
Who are you?

41:30.869 --> 41:32.369
I don't know this woman.

41:32.370 --> 41:34.371
- Call the police.
- Call security!

41:34.372 --> 41:36.244
She's trying to kill me.

41:46.715 --> 41:48.256
Hey, come here.

41:53.391 --> 41:54.512
- Whoa!
- Oh!

41:58.476 --> 42:00.138
Holden?

42:01.810 --> 42:03.021
Did something happen?

42:05.644 --> 42:07.275
You could say that.
