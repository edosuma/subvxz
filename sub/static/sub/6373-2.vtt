[Daniel] Previously on Ugly Betty:

00:03.036 --> 00:05.163
- Killer poncho.
- Thanks!

00:06.039 --> 00:07.666
- I'm Betty Suarez.
- Hi, Betty.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.174
I'm your new assistant.

00:09.776 --> 00:12.108
I got the job 'cause Meade
didn't want his son

00:12.178 --> 00:14.146
tempted to sleep with his assistant.

00:14.214 --> 00:16.648
Nepotistic son of a bitch
gives my job to his...

00:16.716 --> 00:18.081
- His son.
- [Sighs]

00:18.618 --> 00:21.815
[Woman] So the question is:
How do we get to Bradford?

00:21.888 --> 00:24.652
- We use Daniel.
- Who is this?

00:24.724 --> 00:27.887
[Woman] he's a man of many,
many secrets, Daniel.

00:27.961 --> 00:32.261
Dig a little deeper, and you may find
he's capable of practically anything.

00:33.366 --> 00:36.199
- [Techno music plays]
- Wait. Excuse me, sir?

00:36.269 --> 00:38.396
You know, I think
I was here before them.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.300
This is a party for my boss.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.571
Daniel Meade. I'm his assistant.

00:45.645 --> 00:46.976
[Indistinct chatter]

00:47.047 --> 00:50.039
No, I am. I am. Here, look,
I have my Xerox card.

00:50.116 --> 00:51.845
- Somewhere, I know I have it.
- You.

00:51.918 --> 00:54.716
- [Woman] Me? Thanks!
- They don't give these to anybody.

00:55.121 --> 00:56.349
Oh, see, she knows me!

00:56.423 --> 00:58.015
- Amanda!
- [Man] Right this way.

00:58.091 --> 00:59.922
[Amanda] Excuse us.

00:59.993 --> 01:02.427
Sweetheart, why don't you
come back Monday?

01:02.495 --> 01:06.397
That's when we let anybody in.
Come on, come on...

01:09.102 --> 01:11.832
Here, look, I found it,
my Xerox card.

01:11.905 --> 01:16.035
I'm standing outside Vamp,
Manhattan's hot spot du jour.

01:16.109 --> 01:19.909
It's nothing but trendy and Fendi
here for Daniel Meade's cover party

01:19.979 --> 01:24.075
as we celebrate his
first issue of Mode hitting the stands.

01:24.150 --> 01:27.916
More than a few eyebrows were raised
on the catwalk when Meade was chosen

01:27.987 --> 01:30.182
to replace the late Fay Sommers

01:30.256 --> 01:33.225
over seasoned creative director
Wilhelmina Slater.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.284
[Man] Miss Slater!
Please, to the right!

01:35.361 --> 01:37.591
- You look gorgeous.
- [Man 2] Wilhelmina, hi!

01:37.664 --> 01:40.098
- What'd I miss?
- The Times, Page Six, The News.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.999
They've been all over Daniel.
Heidi Klum's a no-show,

01:43.069 --> 01:44.969
Isaac's in the back getting sloppy.

01:45.038 --> 01:49.134
Wait till you see
Veronica Jansen's face-lift. Lawsuit!

01:49.209 --> 01:50.642
[* Pussycat Dolls: Buttons]

01:50.710 --> 01:53.838
Look at them falling over themselves
trying to get a quote.

01:53.913 --> 01:56.347
As if he actually knew
anything about fashion.

01:56.416 --> 01:59.749
The man went to Vera Wang's spring line,
gave her a high-five.

Oh.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.467
Hi.

02:26.546 --> 02:30.243
- Walter, what are you doing here?
- OK, my turn!

02:30.316 --> 02:31.943
Betty, check it out!

02:33.553 --> 02:38.513
Actually, I think I'm the one that
should be asking the questions here.

02:38.591 --> 02:42.220
Like what were you doing out
at some club with your boss 'til all...

02:42.295 --> 02:44.490
...nine forty-five.

02:44.564 --> 02:47.465
Well, it was a party
for his first issue,

02:47.534 --> 02:49.832
and why am I
explaining this to you, Walter?

02:49.903 --> 02:52.804
- We're not even dating anymore.
- And whose fault is that?

02:52.872 --> 02:55.363
Well, you're the one
who dumped me for Gina.

02:55.441 --> 02:59.104
For just two days! And it takes
longer than that to digest corn.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.945
As beautiful an apology
as that is, Walter, I think we're over.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.008
Come on.
Betty, look what I brought you.

03:06.085 --> 03:08.383
This game's been on
back-order for months.

03:08.454 --> 03:11.014
Couldn't even use my discount.
Full price!

03:11.090 --> 03:15.220
I'm supposed to forgive you because
you couldn't use your employee discount?

03:15.295 --> 03:17.991
Walter, go home.

03:18.064 --> 03:20.464
I would, but we're
in the middle of a game here.

03:20.533 --> 03:21.522
- [Beeping]
- Yes!

03:21.601 --> 03:25.059
OK, now I'm gonna go home.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.980
[Walter] Full price!

03:41.554 --> 03:44.546
[Dance music plays]

03:47.660 --> 03:51.289
July issue. Black lace push-up bra,
red mesh thong.

03:51.364 --> 03:52.831
See, I never forget a face.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.231
Careful, Daniel,
I think she's only 12.

03:56.336 --> 04:00.636
- Hi, Dad.
- I see that you've been mingling.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.665
Are you talking to anyone
who actually matters?

04:03.743 --> 04:08.510
I've done 40 interviews already.
Looks like my first issue's a home run.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.572
Yeah. You pulled it off.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.641
Christy Benson from New York Minute

04:12.719 --> 04:15.051
seems to think I did
more than pull it off.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.817
You're the editor of Mode, Daniel.
Mode sells Mode.

04:17.890 --> 04:20.552
[Man] Mr. Meade?
Might we get a two-shot with Daniel?

04:20.627 --> 04:22.356
[Man 2] Couple more, sir?

04:22.428 --> 04:23.986
To the right. Thank you.

04:24.063 --> 04:26.258
Real nice.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.891
Well, if that wasn't a cover shot.

04:29.969 --> 04:33.496
Media mogul Bradford Meade
and his son, the shining star.

04:33.840 --> 04:37.606
The issue's a big hit, Daniel.
Your brother really would've been proud.

04:37.677 --> 04:40.805
Oh, I'm not so sure about that.
I mean, what did I do anyway?

04:40.880 --> 04:42.939
Mode sells Mode. Right, Dad?

04:43.850 --> 04:45.545
Do you remember the yacht?

04:45.618 --> 04:47.950
Your dad throws this party
to introduce Alex

04:48.021 --> 04:50.785
to the fashion community
as the new editor of hudson.

04:50.857 --> 04:53.382
He walks in with a black pinstripe
Armani jacket,

04:53.459 --> 04:57.520
white tuxedo front shirt,
and polka-dot boxers.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.900
That picture ended up in
every newspaper in the country.

05:01.968 --> 05:05.597
Circulation went up 38 percent.
That is an editor.

05:05.672 --> 05:08.835
I wish you'd told me.
I would've dropped my pants for you.

05:12.178 --> 05:16.080
I'm sorry. Maybe it was insensitive
of me to have mentioned him tonight.

05:16.149 --> 05:21.382
This is Daniel's party,
but Alex is such a tough act to follow.

05:23.222 --> 05:25.656
So was the club amazing?

05:25.725 --> 05:29.058
They say people wait in line
for three hours just to get inside.

05:29.128 --> 05:31.688
- Some even more.
- You're home early.

05:31.764 --> 05:33.095
I checked your homework.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.158
Was there any famous people?
Did you bring me a matchbook?

05:36.235 --> 05:39.033
- Justin, I forgot.
- What about the bathroom doors?

05:39.105 --> 05:41.369
They really fog over
when you push a button?

05:41.441 --> 05:45.275
- I didn't have to use the bathroom.
- OK, Justin, go get ready for bed.

05:46.379 --> 05:49.280
And, by the way,
I read your boss's first issue.

05:49.349 --> 05:54.048
A little bulky, but good balance
of style, accessories, and puff pieces.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.049
You didn't get in, did you?

06:00.326 --> 06:03.193
I have to go e-mail Daniel
his itinerary for tomorrow.

06:03.262 --> 06:06.527
Sientate.
Why do you do this to yourself?

06:06.599 --> 06:09.796
I keep telling you,
those places aren't for people like us.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.838
Hilda! Please, just... don't.

06:16.309 --> 06:17.776
OK.

OK, look, If this is so important
to you, let me help you.

- How?
- How?!

I am the top-selling Herbalux
sales associate in my district.

06:27.353 --> 06:29.913
And all because I know
how to sell myself.

You gotta look it to be it!

06:33.659 --> 06:37.390
- That's the Herbalux way.
- Thanks, but I don't think so.

06:42.301 --> 06:45.236

...they're not gonna change.
Uh-huh. You have to.

- Good morning to you, too.
- You know what the doctor said.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.160
He already took my cigars.
One cup of coffee isn't...

07:43.229 --> 07:46.392
Sorry, have you been going
to medical school on your lunch hour?

07:46.466 --> 07:49.663
Take this seriously.
This is your heart. You take your pill?

07:49.735 --> 07:51.862
I only have a few.
Trying to make 'em last.

07:51.938 --> 07:56.500
- Dad. Take it. We'll get a refill.
- All right. I'm taking it.

07:56.576 --> 08:00.239
You know, I actually think I'm making
some headway on this HMO thing.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.941
I finally got a real person
on the phone yesterday

08:03.015 --> 08:05.313
instead of some stupid recording.

08:06.919 --> 08:08.910
I had to wash it down with something.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.570
You didn't stay long last night.

08:26.639 --> 08:30.234
No, sorry. I had to wake up early
for the conference call to Milan,

08:30.309 --> 08:32.504
and then go over the Keira shoot proofs,

08:32.578 --> 08:35.638
and then approve the models
for the Paris spread.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.182
It's 9:15.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.650
Well, someone's gotta hold
this magazine together, Bradford.

08:41.453 --> 08:46.949
I mean, Daniel is trying,
but some people are just naturals.

08:47.260 --> 08:50.491
Don't worry. I've got his back.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.738
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

09:06.178 --> 09:08.237
Don't you look... sweaty.

09:08.314 --> 09:11.841
I've been in the archives.
Daniel wanted all these back issues.

09:11.918 --> 09:15.319
Mm-hmm. Well, we missed you
at the party last night.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.482
What happened?
Sale at the 99 Cent store?

09:19.859 --> 09:22.123
No, I... I couldn't get in.

09:22.194 --> 09:25.493
[Gasps] Are you serious?
Oh, you poor thing.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.294
Those jerks at the door.

09:27.366 --> 09:30.335
All they seem to care about
is appearance.

09:32.271 --> 09:35.672
Look, it's all about appearance.
That's all Alex did to hudson.

09:35.741 --> 09:39.336
He changed the font, the layout,
hired some trendy photographers,

09:39.412 --> 09:41.710
and my father thinks
he's some kind of hero.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.578
I can do these same things to Mode.

09:43.649 --> 09:46.243
But, Daniel, your first issue
was a big success.

09:46.319 --> 09:50.119
- My nephew loved it.
- It wasn't my issue and you know it.

09:50.189 --> 09:52.953
Wilhelmina chose
every designer, every article.

09:53.025 --> 09:56.119
I just signed my initials
to lots of memos, I...

09:58.464 --> 10:00.056
That's gonna change.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.770
Set up a staff meeting for Monday,
all department heads.

10:04.837 --> 10:06.862
And work around my father's schedule.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.270
I want him there, too.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.968
[Footsteps approaching]

10:10.042 --> 10:12.602
Two words. Fa-boo.

10:12.678 --> 10:15.112
It's for that breast cancer
thing at the Plaza.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.741
And who's the lucky plus one?

10:17.817 --> 10:21.275
- The senator's in town.
- I thought breast cancer was pink.

10:21.354 --> 10:24.084
It is, but Alzheimer's
went better with the outfit.

10:25.091 --> 10:27.992
What? I'm supporting,
that's what counts.

10:28.060 --> 10:30.858
Zip me. What do you want anyhow?

10:30.930 --> 10:33.922
Conference room. And it's good.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.800
Here are all the models
that Alex worked with.

10:36.869 --> 10:39.429
And I found that
font style that he used.

10:39.505 --> 10:42.599
Also, I brought all these
photographers' books.

10:42.675 --> 10:45.576
This one right here.
This is my favorite. He's amazing.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.671
He's shot everyone from, like,
Madonna to the Dalai Lama.

10:48.748 --> 10:50.739
Yeah, this is Vincent Bianchi.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.683
- And he'll never work for us.
- Well, why not?

10:53.753 --> 10:56.244
When he worked with Alex
they got in this blow-up.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.951
He thought Alex was a fraud, Alex
thought he was a temperamental artiste.

11:00.026 --> 11:02.324
He vowed never to work for Meade again.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.795
But, Daniel, you're not Alex.

11:04.864 --> 11:08.925
If my brother, the wunderkind, couldn't
make it work, I doubt I'd be able to...

11:09.001 --> 11:13.028
Look, let's just see
who else is here, huh?

11:14.974 --> 11:18.205
Tweedledee and Tweedledumpy
have been in there for two hours

11:18.277 --> 11:20.541
going over back issues of hudson.

11:20.613 --> 11:24.515
Now, he's trying to actually
rip off his own dead brother.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.017
Oh, my God, it couldn't be any easier

11:27.086 --> 11:30.419
if I gave him the gun
and he aimed it at his foot.

11:37.797 --> 11:41.597
The police released Fey Sommers' car
to a scrap metal yard a week ago.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.761
How come it's taking you
so long to find out where it is?

11:44.837 --> 11:46.270
Location info's private,

11:46.338 --> 11:49.933
and there's over 142 salvage yards
in the Tri-state area alone.

11:50.776 --> 11:53.768
Why don't you go back to your
building and make magazines,

11:53.846 --> 11:56.838
- and let me do what I do.
- You better do what you do quickly.

11:56.916 --> 12:00.113
The grease monkeys in the garage
can't spell their own names,

12:00.186 --> 12:03.678
but it won't take much to figure out
the steering was tampered with.

12:05.124 --> 12:07.615
And I don't care how good
you think your work is.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.898
[Woman] What are we drinking to?

12:16.969 --> 12:21.497
To a father who realizes his child
will never compare to the one he lost.

12:21.574 --> 12:26.443
And to a son who knows he'll never
measure up, no matter how hard he tries.

12:26.512 --> 12:27.638
[Laughs]

12:27.713 --> 12:30.147
It's practically Shakespearean.

12:30.983 --> 12:33.918
As long as there's this wedge
between the two of them,

12:33.986 --> 12:35.783
their relationship is doomed.

12:35.855 --> 12:39.154
Daniel's time at the magazine,
and, ultimately, the company,

12:39.225 --> 12:40.749
will be limited.

12:40.826 --> 12:45.593
Well, perhaps it's time
I drive that wedge a little deeper.

12:46.799 --> 12:49.529
What would Daniel think
if he were tipped off

12:49.602 --> 12:52.969
as to what his dear old father
were capable of?

12:53.038 --> 12:56.599
- [Exhales heavily]
- [Both chuckling]

12:56.675 --> 12:58.666
Mmm.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.976
Hey, what if we
shrink the magazine down

13:05.050 --> 13:07.746
so women can fit it
in their purses easier?

13:14.326 --> 13:17.090
[Sighs] See,
now Alex would've made that.

13:18.063 --> 13:21.965
He should be the one doing this, not me.
At least my father would be happier.

13:22.034 --> 13:25.800
If your father didn't think you could
do this, why'd he give it to you?

13:27.773 --> 13:31.641
Was this Kung Pao chicken
or orange beef?

13:31.710 --> 13:35.510

I don't really think it matters.

13:38.918 --> 13:42.410
The Harvard-Yale game. Biggest
college football game of the year.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.479
You want me to try and get you tickets?

13:44.557 --> 13:48.049
Every year since we were kids
my father would take Alex to that game.

13:48.127 --> 13:51.096
It was their thing.
He never once invited me.

13:55.167 --> 13:59.399

Alex died he was gonna ask me to go.

- Yeah, he's really amazing.

15:33.165 --> 15:35.531
He ended up making it
as a photographer, huh?

15:35.601 --> 15:39.093

He grew up over on Grand.

15:41.373 --> 15:45.309

- He grew up four blocks from here?

about his kid's pictures.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.076

hanging on the wall in there.

have to leave a message.

27:51.169 --> 27:54.605
Ask him what he's been up to
at the Bayonne Salvage Yard.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.641
[Phone hangs up]

28:00.145 --> 28:02.272
What the hell is that supposed... Whoa.

28:03.748 --> 28:06.717
- Look at you.
- Yep!

28:06.785 --> 28:09.447
You told me to dress up
for our lunch today.

28:09.521 --> 28:12.012
And dress up you did. Yeah.

28:13.892 --> 28:16.486
I was thinking, maybe
we should call Madison Six,

28:16.561 --> 28:20.759
see if they have a table in the back,
so we can have privacy with Bianchi.

28:20.832 --> 28:22.732
- OK.
- Great.

28:35.447 --> 28:38.610
- Have you seen her yet?
- Yes, I did.

28:38.683 --> 28:41.675
And it looks as if
Queens threw up. [scoffs]

28:45.056 --> 28:47.490
He should be quite impressed.

28:48.159 --> 28:51.026
Ooh. Someone got their hair did.

28:53.331 --> 28:56.198
So I'm pitching we go
for an entire redesign.

28:56.267 --> 29:01.227
Splashier colors, bolder looks.
Overhaul the entire layout.

29:01.306 --> 29:03.331
It can be a whole new Mode.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.706
Stop using the, you know,
same old models.

29:05.777 --> 29:09.042
Get cutting-edge photographers,
more interesting writers.

29:09.114 --> 29:12.379
Do we really need
another editorial on eating disorders?

29:18.022 --> 29:22.254
Now, I happen to be having lunch today
with Vincent Bianchi to discuss...

29:22.327 --> 29:25.262
Vincent Bianchi? You expect him
to do a spread for Mode?

29:25.330 --> 29:29.289
You know his history with the company.
Your brother couldn't work with him.

29:29.367 --> 29:30.994
Why do you even try?

29:34.038 --> 29:35.699
Because he's one of the best.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.572
And I think I can
persuade him to consider it.

29:38.977 --> 29:40.069
Daniel, I, for one,

29:40.145 --> 29:44.081
think it's wonderful you've taken
such initiative with the magazine.

29:44.149 --> 29:46.879
But some of these changes
you're suggesting...

29:46.951 --> 29:48.816
Let me put it this way.

29:48.887 --> 29:53.381
Sometimes change is a positive thing,
and then sometimes...

29:53.458 --> 29:57.258
Well, they can spin out of control.
You start with a simple redesign,

29:57.328 --> 29:59.762
and, all of a sudden,
before you know it,

29:59.831 --> 30:04.461
you're talking about "bold new colors,"
and a "daring new look,"

30:04.536 --> 30:07.505
and the truth is you haven't
really improved on a thing.

30:08.706 --> 30:11.004
- Wilhelmina.
- I'm just saying...

30:11.075 --> 30:13.236
...change isn't always for the better.

30:13.311 --> 30:16.872
In some cases, it can make
a bad situation even worse.

30:16.948 --> 30:19.382
[Indistinct chattering]

30:40.338 --> 30:41.805
[Knocking on wall]

30:42.240 --> 30:44.299
This is the ladies' room.

30:44.375 --> 30:46.343
I wanted to make sure you were OK.

30:46.411 --> 30:48.606
It's just another day at Mode.

30:48.680 --> 30:52.707
You can't listen to a thing
Wilhelmina says. She's a jerk.

30:52.784 --> 30:54.945
No, Daniel, I'm the jerk.

30:55.019 --> 30:58.045
Thinking that fake nails
and a new hairdo

30:58.122 --> 31:01.057
could actually make a difference
on someone like me.

31:01.125 --> 31:05.118
OK, yeah, look...

31:08.466 --> 31:10.991
I don't know what
I'm supposed to tell you.

31:11.069 --> 31:14.004
This is the way this place works.

31:14.072 --> 31:16.302
It is a fashion magazine.

31:16.374 --> 31:19.832
Appearance... It means something here.

31:19.911 --> 31:21.902
I know.

31:23.648 --> 31:27.243
Listen, I know you're gonna feel
a whole lot better after our lunch.

31:28.486 --> 31:30.249
You can order anything you want.

31:30.321 --> 31:34.382
- I don't... I'm not going.
- What? No, no, you have to go.

31:34.459 --> 31:36.427
Betty, Bianchi wants to meet you.

31:36.494 --> 31:38.655
You're the reason
this lunch's happening.

31:38.730 --> 31:42.222
Daniel, he doesn't even know who I am.
Just take Amanda.

31:42.300 --> 31:45.326
It's like you said,
appearance means something.

31:45.403 --> 31:48.600
- She'll fit right in at Madison Six.
- Betty, come on...

31:48.673 --> 31:50.868
Daniel, just go, you're gonna be late.

31:52.343 --> 31:53.970
And don't forget the proposal.

32:03.788 --> 32:06.621
[Door opens, closes]

32:12.230 --> 32:13.219
[Door opening]

32:13.298 --> 32:16.096
About time. How long does it take
to put on makeup?

32:17.669 --> 32:20.331
Well, I also had to fix my hair.

32:20.939 --> 32:24.898
I thought you were Amanda.
I didn't know you'd be joining us.

32:24.976 --> 32:28.309
Afraid I might botch things up
with Bianchi if I were on my own?

32:28.379 --> 32:32.543
Let's just say that I had a sudden
craving for the quail at Madison Six.

32:37.855 --> 32:41.313
OK, "Betty Suarez" is here.

32:41.392 --> 32:43.189
Shall we?

32:59.577 --> 33:02.944
He called.
He's running late to pick you up.

33:03.348 --> 33:06.784
Well, a senator's life
can never be called his own.

33:06.851 --> 33:10.412
Be sure to meet him downstairs
to escort him up.

33:17.562 --> 33:19.587
Vincent, Daniel Meade.
Sorry we're late.

33:19.664 --> 33:20.653
No problem.

33:20.732 --> 33:24.429
Just killing time trying to figure out
what these five forks are for.

33:24.502 --> 33:27.300
- Bradford Meade.
- I remember you, yeah.

33:27.538 --> 33:31.565
- And this is... Betty Suarez.
- [Chuckles] Hola!

33:36.481 --> 33:38.472
[Hushed laughter]

33:54.532 --> 33:57.399
- The quail here is excellent.
- Quail.

33:57.969 --> 34:00.233
Could you hear them
in the old neighborhood

34:00.304 --> 34:02.295
if they saw us in a place like this?

34:04.308 --> 34:07.368
- Carbs. No.
- [Daniel clears his throat]

34:10.047 --> 34:13.984
But... who cares about carbs
when you're from Queens, right?

34:16.387 --> 34:19.686
Excuse me. I'm gonna need
a very large glass of wine, please.

34:21.826 --> 34:24.487
Is this color peach or salmon?

34:24.562 --> 34:26.928
Marc, will you cover
my phones for me, please?

34:26.998 --> 34:30.364
- Daniel forgot the proposal.
- I'll bring it to the restaurant.

34:30.435 --> 34:32.630
- I'll take it to him. It's my job.
- Come on.

34:32.703 --> 34:35.399
They won't even let you
past the host at Madison Six.

34:35.473 --> 34:38.203
- Just let me. I got it.
- Marc! Give it to me.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.801
I can't hit your boss,
but I can hit you,

34:40.911 --> 34:43.574
and everybody knows
I'm from Queens so I will do it!

34:45.183 --> 34:46.911
Thank you.

34:54.692 --> 34:58.628
So, none of the girls looked like you
when I went to Queensborough High.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.961
Hey, does Mrs. Rodriguez
still teach there?

35:03.701 --> 35:05.430
I'm gonna say...

35:07.805 --> 35:09.602
...she died.

35:21.319 --> 35:25.449
So... you're still
just a creative director?

35:27.425 --> 35:29.484
Yes, Daddy.

35:30.528 --> 35:32.519
Shall we?

35:38.903 --> 35:42.339
So we feel this holiday issue
is our chance to try something

35:42.406 --> 35:45.773
really out there for our feature spread,
four-page pullout.

35:45.843 --> 35:48.243
You'd have total
carte blanche, of course.

35:48.312 --> 35:50.507
What does your old man do, anyway?

35:50.815 --> 35:51.975
Investment banker.

35:53.251 --> 35:56.015
Your father's
an investment banker, Betty?

35:56.087 --> 36:00.319
Oh, I mean, yeah,
that was always his dream.

36:00.391 --> 36:04.521
You know, if he ever
made it out of the barrio.

36:04.595 --> 36:07.792
- What?
- OK, that's it. It's over.

36:07.865 --> 36:10.459
- Daniel...
- Look, I can't keep doing this, Dad.

36:10.535 --> 36:13.902
- I'm sorry, Mr. Bianchi...
- Are you ready to hear the specials?

36:13.971 --> 36:17.839
Could you hold off on the specials?
I'm about to blow a very big deal here.

36:18.743 --> 36:22.406
Mr. Bianchi, this is not Betty Suarez.

36:23.848 --> 36:24.974
Mmm?

36:25.883 --> 36:31.651
[Scoffs] No kidding.
Come on, give me some credit.

36:31.722 --> 36:35.180
This girl's never been within ten feet
of a sausage and pepper hero

36:35.259 --> 36:36.851
- in her life.
- He is so right.

36:36.928 --> 36:39.362
So where's the girl
I talked to on the phone?

36:39.430 --> 36:41.990
She didn't wanna come.
And it's my fault.

36:42.066 --> 36:44.534
She was looking forward
to meeting you very much,

36:44.602 --> 36:47.969
but because we're all caught up
with some stupid image,

36:48.039 --> 36:51.008
I made her feel insecure
about fitting into a place like this.

36:51.075 --> 36:52.667
[Betty] No, really, he's my boss.

36:52.743 --> 36:55.906
I need to take him the envelope.
Right there. It's ten feet in.

36:55.980 --> 36:58.608
I can't imagine why you thought
she wouldn't fit in.

36:59.650 --> 37:01.481
Look, here he comes. He'll tell you.

37:01.552 --> 37:04.180
I'm sorry, Mr. Meade,
she says that she's with you.

37:04.255 --> 37:07.281
- She is.
- Look, you forgot the layout proposal.

37:07.358 --> 37:09.792
There's someone
I want you to meet. Come here.

37:13.097 --> 37:15.622
Now, this must be Betty Suarez!

37:15.933 --> 37:20.802
Mr. Bianchi, hi.
It's really an honor, really.

37:21.606 --> 37:24.700
Look, Mr. Bianchi,
between your fight with my brother

37:24.775 --> 37:28.176
and what we tried to pull off,
I'm sure there isn't a reason in hell

37:28.246 --> 37:30.714
you'd wanna work with us.
But, I gotta say,

37:30.781 --> 37:34.581
I think it'd be
a great opportunity for both of us.

37:34.652 --> 37:37.917
You'd have free reign to call
your own shots, I give you my word.

37:37.989 --> 37:40.355
Actually, I give you Betty's word.

37:40.424 --> 37:43.359
She's the only one
who's been straight with you so far.

37:48.532 --> 37:51.023
You know,
you're nothing like your brother.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.071
No. I'm not.

37:56.007 --> 37:57.531
I'm not Alex.

37:59.243 --> 38:01.211
I'll leave you with the proposal.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.803
Mr. Bianchi.

38:05.816 --> 38:06.805
Here you go.

38:08.185 --> 38:09.413
Thanks.

38:10.988 --> 38:12.979
[Dishes clattering]

38:16.627 --> 38:19.391
Excuse me,
could I get a matchbook, please?

38:19.463 --> 38:21.795
My nephew is never gonna believe this.

38:21.866 --> 38:23.993
- There you go.
- Awesome. Thanks.

38:29.373 --> 38:31.534
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

38:31.609 --> 38:34.874
I should've insisted you come
to lunch with me today. I...

38:34.945 --> 38:37.209
Well, Daniel,
I'm sorry that I backed down.

38:37.281 --> 38:40.808
I mean, I should not have let
Wilhelmina get to me like that.

38:40.885 --> 38:43.581
Fake nails or not,
you came through for us, Betty.

38:43.654 --> 38:46.316
Bianchi was only there because of you.

38:46.390 --> 38:48.585
Guess you really do have cojones, huh?

38:48.659 --> 38:50.126
[Knock on door]

38:50.995 --> 38:52.587

- We got him?

38:59.503 --> 39:00.765
You got him.

39:00.838 --> 39:04.501
His one stipulation is that he answers
only to you and to no other,

39:04.575 --> 39:08.341
- quote, "blowhards."
- OK.

an e-mail to all Creative.

our December feature spread.

39:22.860 --> 39:23.884
Right away, sir.

39:26.664 --> 39:29.656
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

39:32.703 --> 39:36.935
Dad, I got a weird call from some woman.

39:37.441 --> 39:40.706
She said to ask you about
Bayonne Scrap Yard.

39:41.846 --> 39:45.145
- Mean anything?
- Haven't the foggiest.

39:45.950 --> 39:48.441
Must be some kind of crank.

39:48.519 --> 39:51.352
I've never even been to Bayonne.

in time for dinner!

40:44.475 --> 40:48.104
What happened to your makeup?
And your nails!

40:48.179 --> 40:51.444
- It was kind of a long day.
- They didn't fire you, did they?

40:51.515 --> 40:54.973
- I'll go down there...
- No, Dad, they didn't fire me.

40:55.052 --> 40:58.180
In fact, because of me,

40:58.255 --> 41:01.986
we landed Vincent Bianchi
for a big magazine shoot.

41:02.059 --> 41:04.789
That's a big deal?
I could've gotten you that kid.

41:04.862 --> 41:07.353
Yes, Dad, it's kind of a big deal.

41:07.431 --> 41:09.991
It's a really big deal.

41:10.868 --> 41:12.927
Well, in that case...

none of it would've even happened.
