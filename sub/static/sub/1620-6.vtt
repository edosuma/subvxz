02:25.646 --> 02:27.940
Your pardon, Your Grace.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.317
I would rise, but...

02:30.442 --> 02:33.445
Do you know what your wife has done?

02:33.987 --> 02:37.908
- She did nothing I did not command.
- Who'd have thought she had it in her?

02:38.033 --> 02:40.702
By what right dare you lay hands
on my blood?

02:40.827 --> 02:43.664
- I am the King's Hand...
- You were the King's Hand!

02:43.789 --> 02:45.582
You shall now be held accountable.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.669
Oh, will both of you shut your mouths?

02:49.628 --> 02:53.340
Catelyn will release Tyrion
and you'll make your peace with Jaime.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.634
He butchered my men.

02:55.759 --> 02:59.680
Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel
when his men attacked Jaime.

02:59.763 --> 03:03.267
- Quiet, woman.
- Jaime has fled the city.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.103
Give me leave to bring him back to justice.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.982
I took you for a king.

03:10.065 --> 03:11.441
Hold your tongue.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.528
He's attacked one of my brothers
and abducted the other.

03:14.653 --> 03:17.948
I should wear the armour
and you the gown.

03:28.959 --> 03:30.961
I shall wear this like a badge of honour.

03:34.173 --> 03:37.342
Wear it in silence or I'll honour you again.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.609
See what she does to me?

03:53.692 --> 03:56.570
My loving wife.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.703
I should not have hit her.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.747
That was not...

04:08.248 --> 04:10.083
That was not kingly.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.420
If we don't act...

04:15.297 --> 04:16.882
there will be a war.

04:16.964 --> 04:23.222
So tell your wife to return
that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing.

04:23.347 --> 04:25.891
She's had her fun, now put an end to it.

04:27.309 --> 04:30.270
You hear me?
Send a raven and put an end to it.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.981
And what about Jaime Lannister?

04:35.651 --> 04:36.902
What about Jaime?

04:37.027 --> 04:40.822
I'm half a kingdom in debt
to his bloody father.

04:40.864 --> 04:44.743
I don't know what happened
between you and those yellow-haired shits.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.538
I don't want to know.
This is what matters -

04:47.621 --> 04:51.250
I can't rule the Kingdoms
if the Starks and the Lannisters

04:51.333 --> 04:54.878
are at each other's throats, so enough.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.257
As you command, Your Grace.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.051
With your leave...

05:01.844 --> 05:04.847
I will return to Winterfell
and set matters straight.

05:04.972 --> 05:08.517
Piss on that. Send a raven.
I want you to stay.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.936
I'm the king. I get what I want.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.944
I never loved my brothers.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.490
A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.371
You were the brother I chose.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.213
We'll talk when I return from the hunt.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.176
The hunt?

05:42.259 --> 05:45.679
Killing things clears my head.

05:45.762 --> 05:49.057
You'll have to sit on the throne
while I'm away.

05:49.141 --> 05:51.143
You'll hate it more than I do.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.979
- The Targaryen girl...
- Seven hells!

05:54.104 --> 05:55.939
Don't start with her again!

05:56.648 --> 05:59.443
The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.529
Put on the badge.
And if you ever take it off again,

06:02.654 --> 06:06.575
I swear to the mother I'll pin the damned thing
on Jaime Lannister.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.117
Khaleesi?

07:32.703 --> 07:34.496
Oh, Khaleesi!

07:45.674 --> 07:47.426
You're hurt.

08:41.063 --> 08:44.399
- Not too fast.
- Come on, Dancer.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.276
When are you gonna tell him?

08:46.360 --> 08:48.445
Not now.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.197
- Blood for blood.
- Come on!

08:50.322 --> 08:52.908
You need to make the Lannisters pay
for Jory and the others.

08:53.075 --> 08:56.495
- You're talking about war.
- I'm talking about justice.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.446
Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in
the bannermen and raise an army.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.167
A Lannister put his spear
through your father's leg.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.785
The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock
where no one can touch him...

09:04.795 --> 09:06.672
You want me to march on Casterly Rock?

09:06.755 --> 09:08.924
- You're not a boy anymore.
- Come on.

09:09.091 --> 09:11.927
They attacked your father.
They've already started the war.

09:12.094 --> 09:16.181
It's your duty to represent your House
when your father can't.

09:16.265 --> 09:19.685
And it's not your duty,
because it's not your House.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.489
Where's Bran?

09:34.241 --> 09:36.201
I don't know.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.161
It's not my House.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.653
Robb?

10:12.321 --> 10:15.449
All alone in the deep, dark woods.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.621
I'm not alone.
My brother is with me.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.331
I don't see him.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.333
Got him hidden under your cloak?

10:24.416 --> 10:26.627
Ooh, that's a pretty pin.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.337
Silver.

10:28.462 --> 10:32.424
We'll take the pin and the horse.
Get down.

10:34.343 --> 10:35.552
Be quick about it.

10:35.677 --> 10:36.970
I can't.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.056
The saddle... The straps.

10:42.768 --> 10:45.687
What's wrong with you?
You some kind of cripple?

10:45.812 --> 10:47.481
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

10:47.606 --> 10:50.025
If you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!

10:50.108 --> 10:52.986
Cut his little cock off
and stuff it in his mouth.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.655
The boy's worth nothing dead.

10:54.780 --> 10:57.074
Benjen Stark's own blood?

10:57.157 --> 11:00.369
Think what Mance would give us.

11:00.494 --> 11:03.789
Piss on Mance Rayder
and piss on the North.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.959
We're going as far south as south goes.

11:07.042 --> 11:10.462
There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.047
Drop the knife!

11:12.923 --> 11:15.092
Let him go and I'll let you live.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.823
Robb.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.617
- Robb.
- Shut up.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.120
Drop the blade!

11:43.245 --> 11:45.163
- No, don't.
- Do it.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.746
Are you all right?

12:26.330 --> 12:28.290
Yes. It doesn't hurt.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.792
Tough little lad.

12:31.502 --> 12:35.631
In the Iron Islands, you're not a man
until you've killed your first enemy.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.841
Well done.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.426
Have you lost your mind?

12:39.468 --> 12:41.261
What if you'd missed?

12:41.386 --> 12:43.805
He would have killed you
and cut Bran's throat.

12:43.889 --> 12:46.350
- You don't have the right...
- To save your brother's life?

12:46.475 --> 12:49.144
It was the only thing to do, so I did it.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.898
What about her?

12:58.362 --> 13:01.740
Give me my life, my lord,
and I'm yours.

13:04.243 --> 13:05.577
We'll keep her alive.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.228
Mord!

13:31.353 --> 13:34.481
Turnkey! Mord!

13:35.858 --> 13:37.943
Mord!

13:42.197 --> 13:43.866
Dwarf man making noise!

13:46.577 --> 13:48.328
How would you like to be rich?

13:48.412 --> 13:50.622
Dwarf man still making noise.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.250
My family is rich.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.210
We have gold, lots of gold.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.504
I'm prepared to give you lots of gold in...

14:00.299 --> 14:02.217
No gold!

14:02.342 --> 14:04.303
Well, I don't have it here.

14:04.428 --> 14:06.638
No gold!

14:06.763 --> 14:08.390
Fuck off.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.585
I don't want to practice today.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.253
No?

14:39.087 --> 14:41.423
They killed Jory.

14:41.465 --> 14:43.467
My father is hurt.

14:44.468 --> 14:46.803
I don't care about stupid wooden swords.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.764
You are troubled.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.432
- Yes.
- Good!

14:50.557 --> 14:52.768
Trouble is the perfect time for training.

14:52.935 --> 14:56.104
When you are dancing in the meadow
with your dolls and kittens,

14:56.188 --> 14:58.106
this is not when fighting happens.

14:58.232 --> 15:00.275
I don't like dolls and k...

15:01.276 --> 15:03.278
You're not here.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.323
You're with your trouble.

15:06.365 --> 15:09.284
If you are with your trouble
when fighting happens...

15:13.163 --> 15:15.040
...more trouble for you.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.167
Just so.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.213
How can you be quick as a snake...

15:25.259 --> 15:27.386
...or as quiet as a shadow...

15:31.765 --> 15:33.767
...when you are somewhere else?

15:37.104 --> 15:39.147
You are fearing for your father, hmm?

15:41.316 --> 15:43.610
That is right.

15:43.735 --> 15:46.822
- Do you pray to the gods?
- The old and the new.

15:48.574 --> 15:50.450
There is only one god...

15:51.326 --> 15:54.204
and his name is death.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.165
And there is only one thing we say to death -

15:58.375 --> 16:00.294
"Not today."

16:08.927 --> 16:11.013
[Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!]
A boy! A boy! A strong boy!

16:11.138 --> 16:15.218
[Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!] A boy! A boy! A strong boy!
[Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!] A boy! A boy! A strong boy!

16:16.101 --> 16:18.187
[Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!] A boy! A boy! A strong boy!

16:25.819 --> 16:27.779
She has to eat the whole heart?

16:28.864 --> 16:30.616
I hope that wasn't my horse.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.492
She's doing well.

16:32.618 --> 16:34.620
She'll never keep it down.

16:34.745 --> 16:36.785
[Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!] A boy! A boy! A strong boy!

16:50.761 --> 16:52.846
[Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!] A boy! A boy! A strong boy!

16:58.018 --> 16:59.811
Tell me what she's saying.

16:59.895 --> 17:02.439
"The prince is riding.

17:02.523 --> 17:05.442
"I have heard the thunder
of his hooves.

17:05.526 --> 17:07.778
"Swift as the wind he rides.

17:09.404 --> 17:12.199
"His enemies will cower before him...

17:13.784 --> 17:17.079
"..and their wives will weep tears of blood."

17:20.999 --> 17:22.917
She's going to have a boy.

17:25.838 --> 17:28.423
He won't be a real Targaryen.

17:28.549 --> 17:30.717
He won't be a true dragon.

18:21.393 --> 18:24.188
[Vezh fin saja rhaesheseres!]
The stallion that mounts the world!

18:24.229 --> 18:27.316
"The stallion who mounts the world."

18:27.441 --> 18:30.360
The stallion is the khal of khals.

18:30.485 --> 18:33.572
He shall unite the people
into a single khalasar.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.909
All the people of the world will be his herd.

18:42.915 --> 18:45.542
[Khalakka dothrae mr'anha.]
A prince rides inside me!

18:45.626 --> 18:49.505
[Ma me nem ahakee ma Rhaego!]
And he shall be called Rhaego!

18:49.588 --> 18:52.007
Rhaego! Rhaego!

18:52.090 --> 18:54.218
Rhaego! Rhaego!

18:54.259 --> 18:56.970
Rhaego! Rhaego...

19:03.227 --> 19:05.687
They love her.

19:08.357 --> 19:12.277
Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego...

19:29.878 --> 19:32.798
She truly is a queen today.

20:01.201 --> 20:04.621
Don't let them see you carrying a sword
in Vaes Dothrak.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.748
You know the law.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.834
It's not my law.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.794
They don't belong to you.

20:10.878 --> 20:13.172
Whatever is hers is also mine.

20:14.173 --> 20:15.883
Once, perhaps.

20:17.926 --> 20:20.637
If I sell one egg,
I'll have enough to buy a ship.

20:20.762 --> 20:22.890
Two eggs - a ship and an army.

20:23.015 --> 20:26.143
- And you have all three.
- I need a large army.

20:27.686 --> 20:29.688
I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont.

20:30.439 --> 20:32.524
The greatest dynasty
this world has ever seen

20:32.649 --> 20:35.110
on my shoulders
since I was five years old,

20:35.152 --> 20:39.990
and no one has ever given me
what they gave to her in that tent. Never.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.575
Not a piece of it.

20:42.367 --> 20:46.705
How can I carry
what I need to carry without it? Hmm?

20:46.830 --> 20:49.082
Who can rule without wealth or fear or love?

20:53.545 --> 20:57.299
Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honour.

21:00.552 --> 21:04.056
You don't think I see you
looking at my little sister, hmm?

21:04.097 --> 21:06.517
Don't think I know what you want?

21:09.228 --> 21:11.813
I don't care. You can have her.

21:11.980 --> 21:16.068
She can be queen of the savages
and dine on the finest bloody horseparts,

21:16.235 --> 21:19.821
and you can dine
on whichever parts of her you like.

21:20.948 --> 21:22.616
But let me go.

21:24.785 --> 21:26.203
You can go.

21:26.328 --> 21:28.080
You can't have the eggs.

21:28.247 --> 21:29.998
You swore an oath to me.

21:30.082 --> 21:32.417
Does loyalty mean nothing to you?

21:32.501 --> 21:34.586
It means everything to me.

21:34.753 --> 21:36.630
And yet here you stand.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.757
And yet here I stand.

21:55.065 --> 21:57.401
Mord!

21:58.402 --> 21:59.945
Mord!

22:02.114 --> 22:03.907
Mord!

22:07.661 --> 22:09.621
Mord!

22:10.747 --> 22:12.457
Mord!

22:13.417 --> 22:15.460
Noise again!

22:18.046 --> 22:20.716
- About the gold...
- No gold!

22:20.841 --> 22:24.303
- No gold.
- Listen to me! Listen to me.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.472
Sometimes possession...

22:27.598 --> 22:29.600
is an abstract concept...

22:31.894 --> 22:36.190
When they captured me, they took my purse,
but the gold is still mine.

22:36.273 --> 22:38.025
Where?

22:38.108 --> 22:41.445
Where? I don't know where,
but when they free me...

22:41.528 --> 22:42.821
You want free?

22:43.864 --> 22:46.116
Go be free.

22:47.492 --> 22:49.578
Have you ever heard the phrase...

22:49.661 --> 22:51.496
"Rich as a Lannister"?

22:54.249 --> 22:56.126
Of course you have!

22:56.251 --> 22:59.129
You're a smart man.

22:59.213 --> 23:02.007
You know who the Lannisters are.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.886
I am a Lannister.

23:06.011 --> 23:09.640
Tyrion, son of Tywin!

23:09.723 --> 23:14.228
And of course,
you have also heard the phrase,

23:14.353 --> 23:17.022
"a Lannister always pays his debts."

23:19.024 --> 23:21.026
if you deliver a message from me...

23:22.611 --> 23:25.864
to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt.

23:28.408 --> 23:29.993
I will owe you gold.

23:31.912 --> 23:34.039
If you deliver the message...

23:34.164 --> 23:37.292
and I live,
which I very much intend to do.

23:40.045 --> 23:41.713
What message?

23:48.762 --> 23:51.306
Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.

23:57.604 --> 24:00.482
You wish to confess your crimes?

24:00.566 --> 24:03.068
Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.

24:04.862 --> 24:07.114
The sky cells always break them.

24:07.239 --> 24:09.449
Speak, Imp.

24:09.575 --> 24:11.743
Meet your gods as an honest man.

24:16.707 --> 24:20.169
Where do I begin, my lords and ladies?

24:21.628 --> 24:25.424
I'm a vile man, I confess it.

24:25.507 --> 24:28.594
My crimes and sins are beyond counting.

24:29.595 --> 24:31.555
I have lied and cheated...

24:32.973 --> 24:34.975
gambled and whored.

24:36.935 --> 24:39.646
I'm not particularly good at violence, but...

24:39.771 --> 24:43.567
I'm good at convincing others
to do violence for me.

24:44.902 --> 24:46.862
You want specifics, I suppose.

24:48.447 --> 24:52.868
When I was seven, I saw a servant girl...
bathing in the river.

24:52.910 --> 24:54.828
I stole her robe.

24:54.953 --> 24:59.124
She was forced to return to the castle
naked and in tears.

25:00.876 --> 25:04.296
If I close my eyes,
I can still see her tits bouncing.

25:08.175 --> 25:12.346
When I was 10,
I stumped my uncle's boots with goatshit.

25:12.471 --> 25:16.058
When confronted with my crime,
I blamed a squire.

25:16.141 --> 25:19.603
Poor boy was flogged and...
I escaped justice.

25:20.062 --> 25:24.399
When I was 12 I milked my eel
into a pot of turtle stew.

25:24.525 --> 25:27.361
I flogged the one-eyed snake.

25:27.528 --> 25:29.363
I skinned my sausage.

25:29.530 --> 25:34.743
I made the bald man cry
into the turtle stew,

25:34.868 --> 25:36.745
which I do believe my sister ate.

25:36.870 --> 25:38.747
At least I hope she did.

25:38.830 --> 25:42.084
I once brought a jackass
and a honeycomb into a brothel...

25:42.167 --> 25:43.210
Silence!

25:43.293 --> 25:44.837
What happened next?

25:45.838 --> 25:47.965
What do you think you're doing?

25:48.966 --> 25:50.884
Confessing my crimes.

25:51.009 --> 25:57.057
Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man
to slay my son Bran in his bed,

25:57.182 --> 25:59.852
and of conspiring to murder
my sister's husband -

25:59.893 --> 26:03.689
Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.

26:03.772 --> 26:05.983
Oh, I'm very sorry.

26:06.984 --> 26:09.069
I don't know anything about all that.

26:10.237 --> 26:12.531
You've had your little joke.

26:12.656 --> 26:14.867
I trust you enjoyed it.

26:14.992 --> 26:17.870
Mord, take him back to the dungeon.

26:17.911 --> 26:21.331
But this time find a smaller cell...
with a steeper floor.

26:22.457 --> 26:26.503
Is this how justice is done in the Vale?

26:27.838 --> 26:29.715
You accuse me of crimes,

26:29.840 --> 26:31.049
I deny them,

26:31.175 --> 26:34.511
so you throw me into a cell
to freeze and starve?

26:35.512 --> 26:37.764
Where is the king's justice?

26:37.848 --> 26:40.058
I am accused and demand a trial!

26:42.895 --> 26:47.232
If you're tried and found guilty, then by the
king's own laws you will pay with your life.

26:47.900 --> 26:49.776
I understand the law.

26:51.195 --> 26:53.614
We have no executioner in the Eyrie.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.866
Life is more elegant here.

26:56.617 --> 26:58.368
Open the Moon Door.

27:19.348 --> 27:22.059
You want a trial, my Lord Lannister.

27:22.184 --> 27:24.144
Very well.

27:24.269 --> 27:26.730
My son will listen
to whatever you have to say,

27:26.855 --> 27:28.565
and you will hear his judgement.

27:29.733 --> 27:31.777
Then you will leave...

27:31.902 --> 27:33.779
by one door or the other.

27:33.904 --> 27:36.240
No need to bother Lord Robin.

27:37.074 --> 27:39.368
I demand a trial by combat.

27:49.336 --> 27:51.046
You have that right.

27:52.214 --> 27:54.091
My lady, I beg the honour.

27:54.216 --> 27:56.093
Let me be your champion.

27:56.176 --> 27:58.512
The honour should be mine.

27:58.637 --> 28:01.056
For the love I bore your lord husband...

28:01.139 --> 28:02.766
let me avenge his death.

28:02.891 --> 28:05.310
- I'll fight for you, my lady.
- It'll be my honour.

28:05.435 --> 28:08.438
- The honour should be mine.
- Make the bad man fly!

28:10.274 --> 28:11.650
Ser Vardis...

28:12.568 --> 28:14.361
you're quiet.

28:14.444 --> 28:16.572
Don't you want to avenge my husband?

28:18.782 --> 28:21.326
With all my heart, my lady.

28:21.410 --> 28:23.745
But the Imp is half my size.

28:23.787 --> 28:27.207
It would be shameful to slaughter such a man
and call it justice.

28:27.332 --> 28:28.500
Agreed.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.961
You demanded a trial by combat.

28:31.587 --> 28:34.756
Now I demand a champion.
I have that right, same as you.

28:34.882 --> 28:36.508
My lady,

28:36.592 --> 28:39.553
I will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.

28:40.470 --> 28:42.806
I wouldn't be too glad, ser.

28:42.973 --> 28:45.475
I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.

28:47.144 --> 28:49.646
The Kingslayer
is hundreds of miles from here.

28:49.771 --> 28:52.232
Send a raven for him. I'm happy to wait.

28:53.233 --> 28:55.277
The trial will be today.

28:58.697 --> 29:00.824
Do I have a volunteer?

29:08.707 --> 29:10.626
Anyone?

29:11.376 --> 29:13.170
Anyone?

29:16.215 --> 29:18.592
I think we can assume that no one is willing...

29:18.717 --> 29:20.469
I'll stand for the dwarf.

29:32.147 --> 29:34.149
More wine, Your Grace?

29:36.235 --> 29:38.737
- What was I saying?
- Simpler time.

29:38.862 --> 29:41.990
It was! It was.
You're too young to remember.

29:42.157 --> 29:43.825
Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?

29:43.951 --> 29:47.329
- It was, Your Grace.
- The enemy was right there in the open,

29:47.454 --> 29:51.500
vicious as you like,
all but sending you a bloody invitation.

29:51.625 --> 29:53.418
Nothing like today.

29:53.502 --> 29:56.380
- It sounds exhilarating.
- Exhilarating, yes.

29:56.505 --> 30:01.218
Not as exhilarating as those balls
and masquerades you like to throw.

30:06.223 --> 30:08.642
You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?

30:08.725 --> 30:10.310
Once. I think.

30:10.394 --> 30:14.106
You think? I think you'd remember.

30:14.273 --> 30:17.109
Back in our day, you weren't a real man

30:17.234 --> 30:20.237
until you'd fucked one girl
from each of the Seven Kingdoms

30:20.320 --> 30:21.989
and the Riverlands.

30:22.114 --> 30:25.284
- We used to call it "making the eight."
- Those were some lucky girls.

30:25.409 --> 30:27.369
You ever make the eight, Barristan?

30:27.494 --> 30:29.329
I don't believe so, Your Grace.

30:29.413 --> 30:31.164
Those were the days.

30:31.290 --> 30:33.041
Which days, exactly?

30:33.125 --> 30:36.628
The ones where half of Westeros
fought the other half and millions died?

30:36.712 --> 30:39.798
Or before that, when the Mad King
slaughtered women and babies

30:39.882 --> 30:42.843
because the voices in his head
told him they deserved it?

30:42.968 --> 30:46.305
Or way before that, when dragons burned
whole cities to the ground?

30:46.388 --> 30:48.432
Easy, boy.

30:48.515 --> 30:51.560
You might be my brother,
but you're speaking to the king.

30:51.602 --> 30:53.145
I suppose it was all rather heroic.

30:53.312 --> 30:55.981
If you were drunk enough
and had some poor Riverlands whore

30:56.064 --> 30:58.609
to shove your prick inside
and make the eight.

31:02.821 --> 31:04.615
More wine, Your Grace?

31:20.964 --> 31:25.052
They burned most everything
in the Riverlands -

31:25.177 --> 31:28.722
our fields, our granaries,

31:28.847 --> 31:31.266
our homes.

31:31.433 --> 31:35.312
They took our women,
then they took 'em again.

31:35.437 --> 31:39.775
When they was done, they butchered them
as if they was animals.

31:39.858 --> 31:43.111
They covered our children in pitch...

31:44.154 --> 31:45.697
and lit them on fire.

31:46.907 --> 31:48.951
Brigands, most likely.

31:50.244 --> 31:54.039
They weren't thieves.
They didn't steal nothing.

31:54.122 --> 31:57.417
They even left something behind, Your Grace.

31:57.543 --> 32:00.796
It's the King's Hand you're addressing,
not the king.

32:00.921 --> 32:02.756
The king is hunting.

32:10.556 --> 32:12.975
Fish. The sigil of House Tully.

32:14.268 --> 32:17.813
Isn't that your wife's House - Tully -
my Lord Hand?

32:22.234 --> 32:25.946
These men, were they flying a sigil?

32:27.030 --> 32:30.826
- A banner?
- None, your... Hand.

32:31.451 --> 32:33.328
The one who was leading them...

32:33.453 --> 32:36.874
Taller by a foot
than any man I've ever met,

32:36.957 --> 32:40.210
saw him cut the blacksmith in two,

32:40.294 --> 32:45.174
saw him take the head of a horse
with a single swing of his sword.

32:45.257 --> 32:47.759
That sounds like someone we know.

32:47.843 --> 32:49.887
The Mountain.

32:49.970 --> 32:53.056
You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.

32:53.140 --> 32:55.976
Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?

32:56.101 --> 32:58.187
The man is an anointed knight.

32:58.270 --> 33:01.356
I've heard him called
Tywin Lannister's mad dog.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.609
I'm sure you have as well.

33:03.734 --> 33:07.487
Can you think of any reason
the Lannisters might possibly have

33:07.613 --> 33:09.239
for being angry with your wife?

33:09.364 --> 33:16.413
If the Lannisters were to order attacks
on villages under the king's protection,

33:16.496 --> 33:19.208
- it would be...
- That would be almost as brazen

33:19.333 --> 33:22.419
as attacking the Hand of the King
in the streets of the capital.

33:22.503 --> 33:24.129
Well...

33:28.717 --> 33:33.722
I cannot give you back your homes
or restore your dead to life,

33:33.805 --> 33:38.435
but perhaps I can give you justice
in the name of our king, Robert.

33:39.436 --> 33:41.730
Lord Beric Dondarrion.

33:45.901 --> 33:47.903
You shall have the command.

33:48.028 --> 33:51.281
Assemble 100 men
and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.

33:51.406 --> 33:53.200
As you command.

34:00.374 --> 34:03.502
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon,
the First of his Name,

34:03.585 --> 34:05.504
King of the Andals and the First Men,

34:05.546 --> 34:09.882
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

34:09.967 --> 34:14.012
I charge you to bring the king's justice
to the false knight Gregor Clegane

34:14.137 --> 34:16.473
and all those who shared in his crimes.

34:16.514 --> 34:19.268
I denounce him and attaint him.

34:20.476 --> 34:23.856
I strip him of all ranks and titles...

34:24.481 --> 34:26.984
of all lands and holdings...

34:27.568 --> 34:29.235
and sentence him to death.

34:29.319 --> 34:33.782
My lord...
This... this is a drastic action.

34:33.949 --> 34:36.618
It would be better to wait
for King Robert's return.

34:36.743 --> 34:39.121
- Grand Maester Pycelle.
- My lord.

34:39.204 --> 34:41.498
Send a raven to Casterly Rock.

34:41.581 --> 34:44.918
Inform Tywin Lannister
that he has been summoned to court

34:45.043 --> 34:47.045
to answer for the crimes of his bannermen.

34:47.170 --> 34:51.216
He will arrive within the fortnight,
or be branded an enemy of the Crown

34:51.341 --> 34:53.260
and a traitor to the realm.

35:07.608 --> 35:10.944
A bold move, my lord, and admirable.

35:11.486 --> 35:13.447
But is it wise to yank the lion's tail?

35:13.530 --> 35:16.992
Tywin Lannister is the richest man
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

35:18.285 --> 35:21.038
Gold wins wars, not soldiers.

35:21.121 --> 35:25.334
Then how come Robert is king
and not Tywin Lannister?

35:48.440 --> 35:50.359
Fight!

35:58.283 --> 36:01.828
Hold!

36:01.954 --> 36:04.164
- Attack! Attack!
- Come on, Ser Vardis!

36:04.248 --> 36:05.791
Attack!

36:10.379 --> 36:12.756
Stand and fight, coward!

37:13.609 --> 37:15.777
Yes!

37:18.822 --> 37:21.575
Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.

37:40.344 --> 37:42.888
What are you doing? Get up!

37:43.055 --> 37:45.933
Get up, get up, get up!

37:48.185 --> 37:50.145
Raise your sword. Raise it!

37:53.607 --> 37:55.234
Get up, man!

37:55.317 --> 37:59.446
- On your feet!
- Get up! Get up and fight, Ser Vardis!

38:13.585 --> 38:16.213
No! Have mercy!

38:40.988 --> 38:43.073
Is it over?

38:47.286 --> 38:50.122
You don't fight with honour!

38:53.250 --> 38:54.376
No.

38:57.212 --> 38:58.380
He did.

39:12.394 --> 39:14.188
Can I make the little man fly now?

39:14.271 --> 39:16.190
Not this little man.

39:16.315 --> 39:18.567
This little man is going home.

39:20.736 --> 39:22.613
I believe you have something of mine.

39:42.674 --> 39:45.385
A Lannister always pays his debts.

40:02.903 --> 40:07.157
You wear your hair like
a real southern lady now.

40:07.199 --> 40:10.327
Well, why shouldn't I?
We're in the South.

40:10.410 --> 40:13.705
It's important to remember
where you come from.

40:13.830 --> 40:17.042
I'm not sure your mother
would like these new styles.

40:17.125 --> 40:19.545
My mother isn't from the North.

40:21.088 --> 40:22.840
I'm aware of that.

40:22.923 --> 40:26.510
Why do you care?
Do you even have hair under there?

40:27.427 --> 40:29.847
Yes. I have hair.

40:29.972 --> 40:31.598
I've never seen it.

40:31.723 --> 40:33.892
Would you like to?

40:34.476 --> 40:35.894
No.

40:37.896 --> 40:40.399
Where are you from anyway?
The North or the South?

40:42.401 --> 40:46.196
- I come from a very small village in...
- Oh, wait.

40:46.280 --> 40:48.657
I just realized... I don't care.

40:48.782 --> 40:50.993
- Sansa...
- Septa.

40:51.076 --> 40:54.329
Now you are being rude.

41:00.169 --> 41:01.712
My prince.

41:04.548 --> 41:06.466
My prince.

41:06.550 --> 41:08.135
My lady.

41:09.469 --> 41:13.223
I fear I have behaved monstrously
the past few weeks.

41:16.768 --> 41:18.687
With your permission?

41:31.200 --> 41:32.993
It's beautiful,

41:33.994 --> 41:35.913
like the one your mother wears.

41:36.079 --> 41:37.998
You'll be queen someday.

41:38.165 --> 41:40.751
It's only fitting you should look the part.

41:45.506 --> 41:48.133
Will you forgive me for my rudeness?

41:49.134 --> 41:50.928
There's nothing to forgive.

41:52.596 --> 41:54.348
You're my lady.

41:56.016 --> 41:58.519
One day we'll be married
in the throne room.

41:58.644 --> 42:02.523
Lords and ladies from all over
the Seven Kingdoms will come,

42:02.689 --> 42:04.858
from the last hearth in the North

42:04.983 --> 42:07.819
to the salt shore in the South.

42:07.986 --> 42:11.031
And you will be queen over all of them.

42:14.451 --> 42:16.745
I'll never disrespect you again.

42:16.870 --> 42:19.957
I'll never be cruel to you again.

42:20.082 --> 42:22.251
Do you understand me?

42:24.169 --> 42:25.796
You're my lady now...

42:27.422 --> 42:28.674
from this day...

42:30.634 --> 42:32.678
until my last day.

42:55.617 --> 42:57.369
Stop.

42:57.494 --> 42:59.413
- Stop!
- Whoa.

43:00.706 --> 43:03.417
- What are you doing?
- Going to King's Landing.

43:03.500 --> 43:05.544
In a turnip cart?

43:05.711 --> 43:08.505
I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbour.

43:09.673 --> 43:11.425
And you can afford that?

43:11.550 --> 43:14.219
Some of my friends
are more generous than others.

43:14.303 --> 43:16.889
There's a thousand girls like you
in King's Landing.

43:16.972 --> 43:19.141
So I'll have lots of company.

43:19.308 --> 43:20.934
Yes, you'll be very popular...

43:21.018 --> 43:24.605
until some fat lord comes to visit
with a big belly and a little prick

43:24.688 --> 43:27.608
and he can't get it up
so he knocks all your teeth out.

43:27.733 --> 43:29.943
And what will happen to me if I stay here?

43:30.027 --> 43:34.031
Will I become Lady Greyjoy,
Mistress of the Iron Islands?

43:34.114 --> 43:35.156
Don't be a fool.

43:35.157 --> 43:39.119
I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark
in the streets of King's Landing.

43:39.786 --> 43:42.956
Every man for a hundred miles
will be marching off to war soon

43:42.998 --> 43:44.917
and most of them will never come back.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.919
There's nothing left for me here.

43:48.253 --> 43:50.297
Let's go, Stemon.

43:50.380 --> 43:51.798
Giddy up.

43:51.882 --> 43:54.051
Let me see it one more time!

43:54.885 --> 43:56.386
See what?

44:07.940 --> 44:09.983
I'm going to miss you!

44:10.025 --> 44:11.777
I know.

44:25.624 --> 44:27.668
I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.

44:27.751 --> 44:29.127
- What?
- Listen...

44:29.253 --> 44:32.089
- What about Joffrey?
- Are you dying because of your leg?

44:32.256 --> 44:34.164
- Is that why you're sending us home?
- What? No.

44:34.174 --> 44:36.510
- Please, Father. Please don't.
- You can't.

44:36.635 --> 44:39.513
I've got my lessons with Syrio.
I'm finally getting good.

44:39.638 --> 44:44.393
This isn't a punishment. I want you back
in Winterfell for your own safety.

44:44.476 --> 44:45.894
Can we take Syrio back with us?

44:46.019 --> 44:49.022
Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher?
I can't go.

44:49.147 --> 44:53.110
I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.
I love him and I'm meant to be his queen

44:53.235 --> 44:55.237
- and have his babies.
- Seven hells.

44:55.404 --> 44:59.658
When you're old enough, I'll make you a match
with someone who's worthy of you,

44:59.741 --> 45:02.369
someone who's brave
and gentle and strong...

45:02.536 --> 45:05.706
I don't want someone brave
and gentle and strong. I want him!

45:05.831 --> 45:08.542
He'll be the greatest king that ever was,
a golden lion,

45:08.625 --> 45:11.420
and I'll give him sons
with beautiful blond hair.

45:11.545 --> 45:14.006
The lion's not his sigil, idiot.

45:14.089 --> 45:15.841
He's a stag, like his father.

45:15.924 --> 45:18.677
He is not.
He's nothing like that old drunk king.

45:21.972 --> 45:24.766
Go on, girls.
Get your septa and start packing your things.

45:24.892 --> 45:26.226
- Wait!
- Come on.

45:26.310 --> 45:27.895
But it's not fair!

46:02.554 --> 46:05.349
"Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair."

46:07.684 --> 46:10.229
"Axel Baratheon, black of hair."

46:11.188 --> 46:14.149
"Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair."

46:15.692 --> 46:18.278
"Stemon Baratheon, black of hair."

46:23.909 --> 46:26.328
"Robert Baratheon, black of hair."

46:28.372 --> 46:30.541
"Joffrey Baratheon...

46:31.750 --> 46:33.752
"golden-haired."

47:05.576 --> 47:07.286
Daenerys!

47:09.663 --> 47:11.456
Where's my sister?

47:11.540 --> 47:12.833
Stop him.

47:12.916 --> 47:16.170
Where is she? Hmm?

47:18.922 --> 47:21.592
Where is she?
I'm here for the feast.

47:22.801 --> 47:24.219
The whore's feast?

47:24.344 --> 47:26.805
- Come.
- Get your hands off me!

47:26.889 --> 47:29.224
No one touches the dragon!

47:30.225 --> 47:32.311
[Khal rhae mhar.]
The sore-foot king.

47:32.394 --> 47:35.063
[Me ifa.]
He walks.

47:37.816 --> 47:40.152
Khal Drogo!

47:40.235 --> 47:42.613
I'm here for the feast.

47:44.531 --> 47:47.531
[Nevakhi vekha ha maan.]
There is a place for you. Lit. A sitting-spot exists for him.

47:47.534 --> 47:49.912
Khal Drogo says there is a place for you.

47:50.037 --> 47:52.080
Back there.

47:54.708 --> 47:56.585
That is no place for a king.

47:56.710 --> 47:59.296
You are no king.

48:01.715 --> 48:03.759
Keep away from me!

48:03.884 --> 48:05.802
Viserys, please.

48:07.930 --> 48:09.723
There she is.

48:14.311 --> 48:17.022
Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.

48:17.147 --> 48:19.608
They can't kill us.

48:20.651 --> 48:23.654
They can't shed blood in their sacred city.

48:30.786 --> 48:32.162
But I can.

48:42.005 --> 48:44.383
I want what I came for.

48:44.466 --> 48:46.718
I want the crown he promised me.

48:47.845 --> 48:49.596
He bought you.

48:49.680 --> 48:51.723
But he never paid for you.

48:56.937 --> 49:01.066
Tell him I want what was bargained for
or I'm taking you back.

49:01.149 --> 49:03.735
He can keep the baby.

49:03.777 --> 49:06.029
I'll cut it out and leave it for him.

49:09.783 --> 49:12.536
[Anha vazhak maan rek me zala.]
I will give to him what he wants.

49:13.121 --> 49:20.416
[Anha vazhak maan firikhnharen hoshora ma mahrazhi aqovi affin mori atihi mae.]
I will give to him a golden crown and men will tremble when they will see it.

49:21.086 --> 49:22.462
What's he saying?

49:24.006 --> 49:25.632
He says yes.

49:27.050 --> 49:29.970
You shall have a golden crown...

49:31.555 --> 49:34.224
...that men shall tremble to behold.

49:45.402 --> 49:47.571
That was all I wanted.

49:49.948 --> 49:51.992
W-What was promised.

50:08.717 --> 50:10.469
[Qora mae!]
Seize him!

50:11.803 --> 50:13.889
No!

50:13.972 --> 50:16.558
No! You cannot touch me.

50:16.642 --> 50:18.936
I am the dragon.
I am the dragon!

50:19.061 --> 50:21.772
I want my crown! Ahh!

50:21.855 --> 50:24.858
[Ammeni haz jolin!]
Empty that pot.

50:33.909 --> 50:36.245
- Look away, Khaleesi.
- No.

50:43.460 --> 50:45.629
No, Dany.

50:45.712 --> 50:47.005
Dany, tell them.

50:47.130 --> 50:48.549
Make them!

50:49.716 --> 50:52.302
Dany, make them...

50:54.096 --> 50:56.098
No, you can't!

50:56.223 --> 50:58.684
Just... Please!

50:59.393 --> 51:01.019
Dany, please!

51:04.064 --> 51:06.316
A crown for a king.

51:21.832 --> 51:23.709
Khaleesi?

51:23.792 --> 51:25.878
He was no dragon.

51:27.087 --> 51:29.715
Fire cannot kill a dragon.

51:32.087 --> 51:38.715
Gold in liquid form is not a fire, Daenerys.
