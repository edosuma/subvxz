00:49.162 --> 00:50.959
CITY OF GOD

01:51.991 --> 01:57.759
Fuck, the chicken's got away!
Go after that chicken, man!

02:00.367 --> 02:02.562
Go on, for fuck's sake!

02:06.673 --> 02:08.800
Get that chicken!

02:22.756 --> 02:25.452
If it's a good photo,
I'll get a job at the paper.

02:25.658 --> 02:27.819
- You think so, Rocket?
- Gotta take the risk.

02:28.027 --> 02:32.657
You'd risk your life
for a picture? Forget it!

02:33.233 --> 02:36.566
You think I want to meet up
with that motherfucking hood?

02:37.604 --> 02:41.472
Get that chicken, bro!

02:43.743 --> 02:46.769
Motherfucker! I told you
to grab that chicken!

02:46.980 --> 02:49.107
Outta my way!

02:49.349 --> 02:51.317
Get that chicken!

03:10.937 --> 03:12.666
If Li'l Z' catches you,
he'll kill you.

03:14.541 --> 03:17.305
Yeah, well,
he's gotta find me first.

03:26.252 --> 03:29.881
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!
Get that chicken!

03:32.425 --> 03:33.756
Shit! The cops!

03:33.960 --> 03:36.224
Don't fucking run off!

03:36.429 --> 03:38.226
Give me that.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.301
Hey, Melonhead! You fucking fag!

03:44.370 --> 03:46.861
A picture could change
my life, but...

03:47.073 --> 03:50.338
in the City of God, if you
run away, they get you...

03:50.944 --> 03:54.402
...and if you stay, they get you too.
- They're coming for us!

03:54.614 --> 03:57.276
It's been that way
ever since I was a kid...

04:00.019 --> 04:03.921
THE SIXTIES

04:10.864 --> 04:12.263
You're useless, man!

04:12.465 --> 04:15.298
- Go get the ball!
- Fucking useless!

04:18.404 --> 04:19.598
Hey, kid!

04:19.805 --> 04:22.832
Give me the ball, I wanna play.

04:24.644 --> 04:28.171
- It's not yours.
- You wanna mess with me?

04:28.381 --> 04:30.815
Fuck off.

04:31.017 --> 04:35.181
- What's your name?
- Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.

04:35.388 --> 04:37.913
- My name's Rocket.
- Some advice, Rocket...

04:38.525 --> 04:41.688
Don't let Li'l Dice
touch that ball. He sucks.

04:42.195 --> 04:44.186
- You lose, pal.
- Go, Shaggy!

04:44.397 --> 04:46.627
That's Shaggy.

04:46.833 --> 04:50.234
To tell the story of the City of God,
I have to start with him.

04:50.436 --> 04:52.461
8, 9, 10, 11...

04:53.740 --> 04:58.143
But in order to tell Shaggy's story, I
must tell the story of the Tender Trio.

04:58.344 --> 05:02.542
Well, Shaggy? The gas truck's coming.
What are you fucking around for?

05:02.749 --> 05:04.683
You're not gonna chicken out...

05:08.021 --> 05:11.548
THE STORY OF THE TENDER TRIO

05:17.230 --> 05:20.688
The notorious Tender Trio
was legendary in the City of God.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.458
Shaggy...

05:23.169 --> 05:24.830
Clipper...

05:25.505 --> 05:26.972
and Goose.

05:28.908 --> 05:32.639
Tagging along were always
Li'l Dice and Benny...

05:32.845 --> 05:34.779
Shaggy's brother.

05:36.049 --> 05:39.712
I never had the courage
to follow my brother, Goose.

05:48.294 --> 05:50.262
Okay, let's go.

05:50.930 --> 05:53.057
Come on, Goose.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.823
Let's go!

06:04.811 --> 06:06.779
Stop! Stop!
Stop this fucker!

06:11.551 --> 06:15.385
Stop or l'll shoot, motherfucker!

06:15.588 --> 06:17.886
Get out!

06:18.291 --> 06:23.354
Hurry up, asshole!
Gimme the money!

06:23.630 --> 06:26.224
Who wants gas?

06:34.807 --> 06:38.334
More! You wanna die for your
boss' damn money?

06:38.544 --> 06:40.535
Shitloads of money here!

06:42.682 --> 06:44.980
You see, asshole?

06:45.985 --> 06:47.145
Asshole!

06:47.353 --> 06:49.321
Fuck! The cops!

06:52.659 --> 06:54.752
Let's get outta here!

06:58.798 --> 07:02.529
Clear out! The place is
crawling with cops!

07:18.317 --> 07:21.548
- Shaggy!
- The ball, Goose, it's yours!

07:31.464 --> 07:34.092
Back then, I thought
the guys in the Tender Trio...

07:34.300 --> 07:36.461
were the most dangerous hoods
in Rio.

07:36.669 --> 07:40.105
Here! Buy some new balls.

07:41.708 --> 07:45.109
But they were just amateurs.

07:47.980 --> 07:51.973
- Even my brother, Goose.
- Rocket, give this money to dad.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.452
But don't tell him it's from me.

07:56.656 --> 07:58.886
Okay?

07:59.092 --> 08:02.084
- Hey, Stringy!
- Yeah?

08:02.295 --> 08:04.559
Look how much l've got.

08:20.046 --> 08:24.779
We came to the City of God
hoping to find paradise.

08:24.984 --> 08:29.648
Many families were homeless
due to flooding...

08:29.856 --> 08:32.256
and acts of arson
in the ghettos.

08:32.457 --> 08:35.393
- A light post!
- We'll have electricity!

08:35.595 --> 08:37.756
The bigwigs in government
didn't joke around.

08:37.964 --> 08:40.899
Homeless? Off to City of God!

08:41.100 --> 08:45.161
There was no electricity,
paved streets or transportation.

08:45.371 --> 08:48.568
But for the rich and powerful
our problems didn't matter.

08:48.808 --> 08:51.777
We were too far removed...

08:51.978 --> 08:54.446
from the picture postcard image
of Rio de Janeiro.

09:11.164 --> 09:13.894
Do you think I can become
a lifeguard one day?

09:14.100 --> 09:15.931
I don't know.

09:16.135 --> 09:19.002
Being a lifeguard is better
than a fishmonger.

09:19.205 --> 09:21.730
I don't want to sell fish.
It stinks.

09:22.275 --> 09:24.641
- Are you insulting your father?
- No.

09:25.378 --> 09:28.347
So what do you want to be?

09:28.748 --> 09:30.375
I don't know.

09:30.650 --> 09:34.177
- Not a hood or a policeman.
- Why not?

09:34.387 --> 09:36.548
I'm scared of getting shot.

09:41.027 --> 09:43.495
Put that thing away, kid.
Are you nuts?

09:43.696 --> 09:47.188
Pointing that gun at me?

09:47.400 --> 09:50.631
Take it easy with the kid, Goose.
Li'l Dice is with me.

09:50.837 --> 09:53.670
Right, I'm a gangster too.

09:53.873 --> 09:56.501
- That gas truck didn't bring much.
- So what?

09:56.709 --> 10:00.338
- We rob gas trucks every day.
- One today, another tomorrow.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.841
No, we need to rob
some rich guy's house.

10:03.049 --> 10:05.483
That's the only
way to get outta here.

10:05.685 --> 10:08.984
Hell, no. What you need
is to follow my plan.

10:09.188 --> 10:10.621
That's it.

10:10.823 --> 10:14.919
The little fart's getting
too big for his britches!

10:20.867 --> 10:24.234
He gets high and starts
talking bullshit.

10:24.437 --> 10:29.602
You two junkies aren't worth
half as much as that kid.

10:31.410 --> 10:34.470
What you got in mind, Li'l Dice?

10:34.680 --> 10:39.276
To be a real hood you need
more than just a gun. You need ideas.

10:42.488 --> 10:44.581
And Li'l Dice had them.

10:45.758 --> 10:48.249
- Is that the motel?
- Yeah.

10:48.661 --> 10:53.394
We go in, grab the money and
get out. No killing, got that?

10:53.599 --> 10:56.932
- I need this.
- Don't touch my gun, kid.

10:57.136 --> 10:58.330
Don't ever do that again.

10:58.537 --> 11:00.129
- Don't point at me.
- Fuck you.

11:00.339 --> 11:04.002
- Don't point your finger at me!
- Stop acting like a baby!

11:04.710 --> 11:05.904
Here's yours.

11:06.112 --> 11:08.512
- Awesome!
- Let's go!

11:08.714 --> 11:11.239
- Not so fast!
- What?

11:11.450 --> 11:13.918
You stay here and keep watch.

11:14.186 --> 11:19.488
If the cops come, shoot that
window over there.

11:19.692 --> 11:22.593
- Why me? Let that dork do that.
- Look...

11:22.795 --> 11:27.994
I gave you this great plan, for free...
While that guy's absolutely useless!

11:28.200 --> 11:29.963
- You just had the idea.
- Exactly!

11:30.169 --> 11:32.660
You're just a kid, remember?

11:33.272 --> 11:36.002
You cover us, okay?

11:37.009 --> 11:41.776
You'll get your turn, so cool it.
Stop trying to rush things.

11:41.981 --> 11:44.472
You stay there.

11:48.287 --> 11:51.415
This is a hold-up, bitch.

11:54.527 --> 12:01.194
You should be studying or working.
You don't even look like hoodlums.

12:01.400 --> 12:05.393
Instead, you ought to be
working or studying, boy.

12:05.604 --> 12:08.471
Shut up!
What a pain in the ass!

12:09.442 --> 12:11.205
Okay, Clipper?

12:13.245 --> 12:14.644
Shall we go in?

12:19.986 --> 12:22.250
I didn't order anything.

12:22.455 --> 12:26.585
It's on the house, sir.
Hand over the money!

12:26.792 --> 12:29.056
Keep calm, all I want
is your cash.

12:29.261 --> 12:30.853
- Don't point that...
- Your wallet...

12:43.275 --> 12:44.799
Hey, man...

12:45.011 --> 12:47.206
What kind of whorehouse is this?

12:50.449 --> 12:53.009
- You from the church?
- Yes, brother.

12:56.088 --> 12:57.077
Give it to me!

12:59.291 --> 13:00.588
Slut!

13:00.826 --> 13:02.623
You're old, fat and flabby!

13:03.596 --> 13:05.894
Wanna take her place?

13:10.369 --> 13:12.530
What's going on?

13:13.672 --> 13:16.368
- The cops! Let's beat it!
- Let's go!

13:21.514 --> 13:25.006
Take that car.
I'll go get Li'l Dice.

13:26.385 --> 13:28.819
Jesus, what a car!

13:34.760 --> 13:39.561
- Something fucked up. Li'l Dice's gone.
- The cops are shooting, let's go!

14:06.592 --> 14:08.992
Slow down! Hold on...

14:09.195 --> 14:12.028
- You said you knew how to drive.
- I do, so cool it!

14:12.231 --> 14:14.927
Turn! Watch out!

14:28.547 --> 14:30.310
You fucking asshole!

14:31.383 --> 14:34.079
Hey, I didn't do it on purpose.

14:34.286 --> 14:37.915
No one saw anything.
So keep your mouths shut, understand?

14:41.694 --> 14:44.595
Hold on, I twisted my ankle.

14:44.797 --> 14:47.129
Goose fucked up his ankle.

14:47.333 --> 14:48.322
It fucking hurts.

14:48.534 --> 14:52.436
Take him into the woods.
I'll shoot to distract the cops.

14:52.638 --> 14:54.970
- In God we trust.
- In God we trust.

14:59.879 --> 15:02.143
Pass me the telephone, Penguin.

15:02.348 --> 15:06.250
Shorty is another notorious guy
in the City of God.

15:06.452 --> 15:08.477
But it's not yet time
to tell his story.

15:10.355 --> 15:14.382
- It fucking hurts, Goose.
- Shut up.

15:15.094 --> 15:19.827
- Wait up...
- You sound like a damn sissy, man.

15:23.902 --> 15:27.167
- Give me your hand! Climb up!
- No one saw anything?

15:27.372 --> 15:32.207
How odd! A car crashes
into a bar and no one saw a thing.

15:32.411 --> 15:35.403
I suppose you didn't see
anything either?

15:35.614 --> 15:39.345
As usual, no one saw,
no one knows.

15:40.085 --> 15:43.543
So what's up, Shorty?

15:44.223 --> 15:46.987
They're hiding in the woods.

15:47.993 --> 15:49.654
- Hello, Melonhead.
- How are you doing?

15:49.862 --> 15:53.298
I have this feeling that
they're out in the woods.

15:53.532 --> 15:57.093
- The motherfuckers.
- They're out in the woods.

15:57.870 --> 16:01.033
Felipe, lock up the car.
Rangel, come with me.

16:05.444 --> 16:08.709
I can't see a thing.
How the hell can they see?

16:08.914 --> 16:11.348
Fucking jungle.

16:15.621 --> 16:19.682
- They stole a fortune at that motel.
- I know.

16:22.027 --> 16:24.689
What if we took the money?

16:25.197 --> 16:29.361
Are you crazy?
I'm not getting mixed up in that.

16:29.568 --> 16:32.128
I want to exterminate these guys.

16:32.337 --> 16:36.637
What? Since when is stealing from
niggers and thieves a crime?

16:36.975 --> 16:43.642
It won't be hard to nab them.
I have a stoolie in the City.

17:08.507 --> 17:15.174
- Did you hear those shots?
- If I catch one of them, I'll kill him.

17:26.925 --> 17:28.449
Maracana!

17:28.760 --> 17:30.955
Open the door.

17:33.232 --> 17:36.963
- What's the matter?
- The cops are after me.

17:45.344 --> 17:46.743
Shaggy!

17:47.946 --> 17:50.813
- Shaggy!
- The cops are on my ass!

17:51.016 --> 17:54.247
- Hide me!
- Quick, come in.

18:02.094 --> 18:06.428
Shit... I thought the cops
would be down there all night.

18:07.766 --> 18:10.667
I had a vision, Goose.

18:11.403 --> 18:14.133
You been smoking something?

18:14.473 --> 18:17.306
- You've had a job, right?
- Yeah.

18:17.509 --> 18:19.568
What's it like?
What do people say?

18:19.778 --> 18:21.905
I worked with my father.

18:22.114 --> 18:25.675
And fathers talk a lot of shit.

18:26.918 --> 18:30.945
You know what, Goose?
I'm getting out, I don't want to die.

18:31.156 --> 18:36.560
- This gangster's life isn't for me.
- Wait! The cops are still down there.

18:36.762 --> 18:39.424
I don't give a shit.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.262
I'm going back to the church.

18:44.870 --> 18:46.963
He that dwells in the secret
place of the most High...

18:47.172 --> 18:50.539
shall abide under the shadow of
the Almighty. I will say of the Lord...

18:50.742 --> 18:55.008
He is my refuge and my fortress,
in Him will I trust.

18:55.213 --> 18:58.444
Fear not the terror by night,
nor the arrow that flies by day...

18:58.650 --> 19:02.677
nor the pestilence that walks
in darkness, nor the destruction...

19:02.888 --> 19:06.756
- Stop, motherfucker!
- Don't move!

19:07.092 --> 19:10.528
Stop, or l'll shoot!

19:12.164 --> 19:17.192
...shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty.

19:17.402 --> 19:22.169
The hold-up at the motel went down
as the bloodiest in history.

19:22.374 --> 19:25.207
The destinies of the outlaws
then took different paths.

19:25.410 --> 19:28.846
I don't think this guy
was involved in the heist.

19:29.047 --> 19:30.742
See here?

19:30.949 --> 19:36.353
- He's a worker, not a hoodlum.
- I'll make him one now.

19:39.624 --> 19:43.924
Destiny put Clipper
back into the hands of God.

19:45.464 --> 19:49.628
Shaggy was in Bernice's hands.

19:51.269 --> 19:54.796
And Goose was
in my father's hands.

19:55.006 --> 19:58.498
Why do you do these things?
You think l'm a fool?

19:58.710 --> 20:01.406
From now on,
you'll work with me.

20:01.613 --> 20:05.777
Your younger brother
will keep an eye on you.

20:05.984 --> 20:07.975
You listen to me.

20:08.186 --> 20:12.555
If I catch you with money that
isn't yours, I'll kill you.

20:12.758 --> 20:18.628
That goes for you too. Get changed!
You start work immediately.

20:18.830 --> 20:24.598
Having a hood as a brother sucks.
You always end up footing the bill.

20:24.803 --> 20:29.069
Don't worry.
Dad's mad at me...

20:29.274 --> 20:33.677
but he'll get over it.

20:36.815 --> 20:40.876
Give me that, Rocket. It's not
for you. You have to study.

20:41.086 --> 20:44.419
- Getting shot doesn't scare you?
- I'm a hood because I got no brain.

20:44.623 --> 20:48.457
But you're smart.
You should study.

20:48.960 --> 20:52.259
I go to school because
I don't like physical work.

20:52.798 --> 20:57.394
Promise me something... That you'll
never touch this gun. Promise?

20:58.136 --> 21:00.195
Let's shake.

21:01.706 --> 21:04.266
We'd better hurry.

21:05.544 --> 21:09.071
I'm gonna sell a lot of fish.
And don't laugh.

21:09.281 --> 21:11.044
You grinned when I got slapped.

21:11.249 --> 21:13.149
- Who, me?
- I saw you.

21:41.112 --> 21:44.604
What is it, Shaggy?
Cat got your tongue?

21:44.816 --> 21:47.410
Your fidgeting behind me
makes me nervous.

21:47.619 --> 21:51.783
- I'm thinking of what to say to you.
- You're thinking, as well?

21:51.990 --> 21:54.322
Don't. It'll be your downfall.

21:54.526 --> 21:58.792
My heart has chosen you.
And I follow my heart.

21:58.997 --> 22:01.431
Are you pulling my leg?

22:01.633 --> 22:04.796
You never heard of
love at first sight?

22:05.437 --> 22:10.431
- Hoods don't love, they desire.
- You cut down everything I say.

22:10.642 --> 22:14.339
Hoods don't talk,
they smooth-talk.

22:14.546 --> 22:17.879
Well, l'll stop wasting
my breath on you.

22:18.083 --> 22:21.610
Hoods don't stop,
they take a break.

22:22.621 --> 22:25.112
Talking to you about love
sure is complicated.

22:25.323 --> 22:28.850
It's not love,
it's a con game.

22:45.143 --> 22:47.577
It's just that I love you.

22:48.613 --> 22:52.208
You just might end up
convincing me...

23:14.205 --> 23:19.199
After the hold-up, there were
constant police raids in the ghetto.

23:25.550 --> 23:30.715
Every day, someone went to jail,
someone was nailed.

23:32.557 --> 23:36.618
But no one had seen anything.
No one knew anything.

23:38.029 --> 23:43.399
No one blabbed to the cops about
where the thieves were hiding out.

23:45.770 --> 23:47.704
3 MONTHS LATER

23:47.906 --> 23:49.066
Shaggy...

23:49.274 --> 23:52.607
Why don't you change your life?

23:53.044 --> 23:56.775
Get a job instead of
lying around in bed all day.

23:56.982 --> 23:59.815
- Good-for-nothing!
- What do you mean?

24:00.018 --> 24:02.987
You think you can make money
working? Go ahead.

24:03.655 --> 24:08.058
That's right, Shaggy...
what do you think I do all day?

24:10.996 --> 24:17.128
Take it easy, baby... you know all
I want is to be with you, have kids...

24:17.335 --> 24:21.897
and a farm, raise chickens,
grow pot and get high.

24:22.107 --> 24:25.975
Sure! For me, that's
nothing but smooth-talk.

24:35.887 --> 24:40.153
What? I almost got
rich with that motel job.

24:40.358 --> 24:41.347
Are you kidding?

24:41.860 --> 24:46.126
The cops are still looking for you
because of the deaths in the motel.

24:47.599 --> 24:50.466
What deaths?
What are you talking about?

24:50.669 --> 24:54.127
Did you see anything?
You don't know shit, so shut up.

24:54.339 --> 24:57.467
You weren't there.
I didn't kill anyone.

24:57.676 --> 25:01.373
I bet it's those fucking policemen,
and l'm the one taking the rap.

25:01.579 --> 25:05.208
They even nabbed Li'l Dice.
So don't bring it up again!

25:06.685 --> 25:09.483
- I don't care who did it.
- It wasn't me.

25:09.688 --> 25:13.954
Let me just say... I don't want my
kid's father to be a hoodlum.

25:14.159 --> 25:15.558
You're all alone, Shaggy.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.660
- All alone?
- That's right!

25:17.862 --> 25:19.659
- Clipper's gone religious.
- Hallelujah!

25:19.864 --> 25:21.559
- Goose is working.
- Ass-kisser!

25:21.766 --> 25:23.893
- And you?
- I haven't changed. So what?

25:24.102 --> 25:28.402
They've deserted me,
that's all.

25:28.606 --> 25:30.767
Then l'm deserting you too.

25:30.975 --> 25:33.466
I'm splitting, Shaggy.
Come with me, if you want.

25:33.678 --> 25:37.546
Otherwise, l'll go alone.

25:51.596 --> 25:54.224
Fish for sale!

25:54.432 --> 25:57.401
My brother had promised
to stop messing around.

25:57.602 --> 26:04.064
But a hood doesn't stop,
a hood takes a break.

26:04.275 --> 26:07.574
Goose began messing around
with Shorty's wife.

26:08.046 --> 26:12.483
I have trout. But for special
customers like you...

26:12.684 --> 26:15.653
I also have a kisser fish.

26:15.854 --> 26:18.186
Hey, that's a mullet!

26:20.992 --> 26:22.823
Doesn't your husband...

26:23.027 --> 26:25.154
go down on you?

26:26.331 --> 26:27.855
No.

26:28.233 --> 26:31.396
Mine, before entering me,
has to use his tongue.

26:31.603 --> 26:36.267
For about half an hour.
And from behind? Do you let him?

26:36.474 --> 26:41.673
- Good God, no. Doesn't it hurt?
- The first few times.

26:41.880 --> 26:45.611
Then you'll see, it's fantastic.
But you need a banana.

26:45.817 --> 26:47.307
What for?

26:47.519 --> 26:50.511
You're missing the good things
in life, girl!

26:50.722 --> 26:53.623
You take a banana, warm it up...

26:53.825 --> 26:57.556
Put it up your thing, while he
takes you from behind.

26:57.762 --> 27:01.960
It's a real rush!
Ask your husband.

27:02.167 --> 27:06.934
I couldn't. You don't know him.
He's liable to beat me.

27:07.138 --> 27:10.835
Try him. Men go wild
for smut like that.

27:18.383 --> 27:20.783
Motherfucking nigger!

27:23.021 --> 27:25.353
Slut!

27:26.524 --> 27:28.924
Whoring bitch!

27:31.629 --> 27:35.895
Rocket, give me your shorts.
Quick!

27:36.100 --> 27:40.366
- Take them off, dammit!
- I'm not going naked in the street.

27:40.572 --> 27:44.440
You want your brother to die?
Give me your shorts. Now!

27:44.642 --> 27:46.473
Give me your shirt.

27:49.447 --> 27:51.415
Your shorts! Hurry up!

27:53.985 --> 27:58.251
I knew it. It's always me
who forks up for that bum.

28:06.297 --> 28:09.232
The bastard ran off.
That's his brother.

28:09.434 --> 28:11.629
- That brat there?
- I'll castrate that fucker.

28:14.072 --> 28:19.009
Fish! Fish for sale!

28:20.011 --> 28:22.673
Hey, kid, come over here.

28:23.581 --> 28:26.641
- Where's your brother?
- He's not working today.

28:26.851 --> 28:29.581
- Oh yeah? Get in.
- I didn't do anything.

28:29.787 --> 28:31.778
- Get in!
- What about my fish?

28:31.990 --> 28:35.118
- Hurry it up, kid!
- I don't want to lose my fish!

28:35.326 --> 28:39.285
- Forget your fish.
- Sit your ass down.

28:39.497 --> 28:43.297
- My father will kill me.
- That doesn't matter.

28:54.646 --> 28:56.841
Let's go.
There's nothing here.

28:57.048 --> 29:00.984
That day, my father swore he never
wanted to see my brother again.

29:01.185 --> 29:02.812
Let's go, Felipe.

29:06.024 --> 29:09.323
And he never did. No one ever
saw him in the ghetto again.

29:09.527 --> 29:12.985
The story of the Tender Trio
was coming to an end.

29:14.966 --> 29:20.131
Li'l Dice? Shit, man. I thought you
were a goner at the motel.

29:20.338 --> 29:27.005
- You're fucking loaded!
- Don't, Benny. That's our money.

29:27.612 --> 29:31.446
Fuck you. Cut the crap
and give me the money.

29:31.983 --> 29:36.477
Benny... Tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.

29:36.854 --> 29:41.416
- I'm leaving the ghetto.
- But Shorty had his hands full...

29:55.073 --> 29:57.473
Let's go see, Stringy.

30:06.851 --> 30:10.651
A neighbor called the police
before sunrise.

30:10.855 --> 30:13.619
The tabloids went to town:

30:13.825 --> 30:16.988
"Man Buries Wife Alive
in the City of God"

30:17.195 --> 30:20.062
Along with reporters, the place
was swarming with cops.

30:20.264 --> 30:24.200
The hoodlums took off.

30:25.803 --> 30:28.670
- You wanna die?
- It's you who's gonna die...

30:28.873 --> 30:33.003
if you don't do what I say.
And show the lady more respect.

30:35.513 --> 30:37.071
Let's go, dammit!

30:37.281 --> 30:40.011
- There are cops ahead.
- Fuck them, let's go.

30:40.218 --> 30:42.880
- Where to?
- Anywhere, just go.

30:45.490 --> 30:48.459
- What's the matter?
- Have mercy!

30:48.659 --> 30:51.594
- This car's a piece of junk.
- My ass! Start the damn thing!

30:51.796 --> 30:54.321
It needs a push.

30:55.666 --> 30:57.531
Push, Shaggy!

30:57.735 --> 30:59.225
Push!

31:12.517 --> 31:16.886
You?

31:17.555 --> 31:20.388
You want to arrest the thieves?
Over there...

31:20.591 --> 31:23.754
Nab that guy over there!

31:48.052 --> 31:50.145
Run, Shaggy!

31:50.354 --> 31:53.755
Stop the car!

32:35.166 --> 32:41.571
- This way! He's over here.
- We got that sonofabitch!

32:57.021 --> 32:59.512
- The bastard!
- He's a murderer.

32:59.724 --> 33:03.717
On the day Shaggy died
I remember the crowds...

33:03.928 --> 33:06.590
and a camera.

33:06.797 --> 33:10.062
I'd always wanted to have one.

33:11.802 --> 33:14.703
Let's go to school.

33:23.714 --> 33:25.682
- Well?
- Let's go to the beach.

33:25.883 --> 33:27.214
But we have an exam.

33:27.418 --> 33:31.081
So what?

33:31.289 --> 33:33.883
Everyone else is at the beach.

33:34.091 --> 33:37.083
Come on, let's go!

33:37.295 --> 33:40.696
She's in a bikini,
but doesn't want to go.

33:41.432 --> 33:45.801
What's that saying you have?

33:46.003 --> 33:49.166
The sun is for everyone. The beach,
for those who deserve it.

33:51.742 --> 33:54.040
THE SEVENTIES

33:54.245 --> 33:56.145
- Over here!
- I bought my first camera...

33:56.347 --> 34:00.613
when I was 16. Like all poor people,
I started at the bottom...

34:01.052 --> 34:03.520
with the world's cheapest model.

34:04.121 --> 34:07.420
So, Rocket?
How are things going?

34:07.625 --> 34:09.684
Any luck getting laid yet?

34:09.893 --> 34:11.987
Zilch.

34:13.262 --> 34:18.598
- Angelica. I was crazy about her.
- So, Rocket, still clicking away?

34:18.801 --> 34:22.998
She was gorgeous and the only
girl in our gang who screwed.

34:23.205 --> 34:25.196
I wanted to lose
my virginity with her.

34:25.407 --> 34:28.967
With her, buddy?
She's got a guy.

34:29.178 --> 34:32.409
- So? I'm not jealous.
- Her father's a sergeant.

34:32.614 --> 34:36.449
No one's perfect.
Closer together!

34:36.652 --> 34:38.916
I was the official
photographer of our gang.

34:39.955 --> 34:45.985
The gang of groovies. Everyone
paid to have copies of the pictures.

34:52.301 --> 34:55.498
Thiago, move back a little.

34:55.704 --> 34:58.502
- Is this okay?
- Perfect.

35:06.081 --> 35:08.481
I need a joint.

35:08.684 --> 35:13.451
Instead of smoking, man,
you should snort coke. It's far out.

35:13.656 --> 35:17.558
You snort, Thiago?
I prefer a good toke.

35:19.628 --> 35:22.893
If you like,
I can get it for you.

35:23.098 --> 35:27.728
You can? Then go on,
move your ass!

35:27.936 --> 35:31.702
But the choice stuff is coke.
That's a real nercotic.

35:31.907 --> 35:34.239
Narcotic!

35:36.545 --> 35:40.743
- Your mouth is all salty, Thiago.
- Screw you.

35:41.350 --> 35:43.545
You want to be
a lifeguard, Stringy?

35:43.752 --> 35:46.243
- You're never in the water.
- My dad's a lifeguard.

35:46.455 --> 35:50.391
- I'll bet you a beer I swim better.
- You're on.

35:53.195 --> 35:56.995
If you like, I can go get you
a joint at Blacky's.

36:10.045 --> 36:13.105
I'd have done anything
to please her...

36:14.249 --> 36:16.809
Buy her pot, coke...

36:21.023 --> 36:26.359
I could go to the top dogs to buy
quality stuff at a good price...

36:28.130 --> 36:33.898
because the local boss
was a former classmate: Blacky.

36:35.404 --> 36:38.100
- Who is it?
- Rocket.

36:41.310 --> 36:44.575
- How are things down there?
- Fine.

36:44.780 --> 36:46.873
- And the kids?
- Fine too.

36:47.082 --> 36:48.982
- You want to buy or smoke a joint?
- Buy.

36:49.184 --> 36:53.951
Come in, buddy.

36:55.524 --> 37:00.018
Who is it?

37:04.600 --> 37:07.000
This was Blacky's turf.

37:07.202 --> 37:10.797
But it hadn't always been his.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.802
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'l Dice.

37:16.011 --> 37:20.277
- You show up like this at my place?
- Who said it was your place?

37:21.784 --> 37:27.245
THE STORY OF THE APARTMENT
Dona Zelia began selling drugs here...

37:27.456 --> 37:31.449
when her husband died,
in order to raise her daughters.

37:31.660 --> 37:37.064
She also gave away drugs to boys at
times in return for special favors.

37:37.266 --> 37:42.966
Her favorite was "Big Boy".
One day, he grew very big!

37:43.172 --> 37:48.235
Zelia's operation was so amateur that
he had no trouble seizing it from her.

37:49.144 --> 37:53.638
Big Boy used the neighborhood
kids as dealers.

37:54.183 --> 37:58.552
- What about my pot?
- Stick it up your ass.

37:58.754 --> 38:01.518
The best dealer...

38:03.158 --> 38:05.991
...was Carrot.

38:06.195 --> 38:08.823
- Can I have a sip?
- Sure.

38:09.031 --> 38:11.659
He earned Big Boy's trust...

38:11.867 --> 38:14.859
was promoted, and moved up to
become a manager.

38:15.070 --> 38:18.733
Blacky, 20 for us and
5 for you, okay?

38:20.275 --> 38:23.176
One day a buddy of Carrot's
showed up.

38:23.378 --> 38:29.317
- His name was Aristotle.
- My wife needs an operation.

38:29.518 --> 38:35.855
His family had taken Carrot in
when he was down and out.

38:36.058 --> 38:38.822
He couldn't refuse to help
a brother in need.

38:39.027 --> 38:43.464
Here's the dope. I want
the dough no later than Friday.

38:43.665 --> 38:46.498
- You've bailed me out, brother.
- Friday.

38:47.102 --> 38:50.936
He's my buddy, practically
my brother, Big Boy.

38:51.139 --> 38:55.132
Give him another week.

38:57.346 --> 39:01.874
- Either you kill him, or I'll kill you.
- Carrot had no choice.

39:03.552 --> 39:08.080
- I said Friday.
- Don't do it, man.

39:08.290 --> 39:11.885
Carrot wanted to kill Big Boy,
but it wasn't necessary.

39:12.327 --> 39:16.320
Big Boy hadn't paid off the cops.
He died in jail.

39:19.568 --> 39:23.095
Carrot took everything
that belonged to Big Boy...

39:23.305 --> 39:26.934
but didn't want the apartment...

39:27.142 --> 39:31.010
the place was ill-fated. Carrot gave it
to his most trusted dealer...

39:31.213 --> 39:33.943
- Here. 150 bags.
- Blacky.

39:34.149 --> 39:36.276
Give me more. This place
is crawling with druggies.

39:36.485 --> 39:39.750
That's how he took over
the local trade.

39:39.955 --> 39:42.219
But not for long...

39:43.425 --> 39:45.689
Who is it?

39:45.894 --> 39:47.759
Go see.

39:58.707 --> 40:00.698
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'l Dice.

40:00.909 --> 40:04.777
- You show up like this at my place?
- Who said it was your place?

40:04.980 --> 40:07.847
Yeah, who?

40:13.055 --> 40:14.955
- Something wrong, Li'l Dice?
- Li'l Dice, my ass.

40:15.157 --> 40:17.421
My name is Li'l Z' now.

40:17.626 --> 40:20.026
THE STORY OF Ll'L Z'

40:20.228 --> 40:23.254
Li'l Z' had always wanted
to be boss of the City of God...

40:23.465 --> 40:27.799
ever since he was little
and was called "Li'l Dice".

40:31.606 --> 40:34.871
They're having fun,
and not me?

40:44.720 --> 40:46.950
I want to get out of here.

40:47.756 --> 40:51.783
What, kid? Your friend took
everything. What do you want?

40:57.966 --> 41:01.231
That night, Li'I Dice
satisfied his thirst to kill...

41:01.436 --> 41:03.961
though he knew Shaggy would
never forgive him.

41:11.380 --> 41:15.646
To avoid being punished
he left the City of God.

41:16.852 --> 41:19.582
He had to work hard for peanuts.

41:24.693 --> 41:27.856
- Yeah, Benny!
- Li'l Dice and Benny managed well.

41:29.898 --> 41:31.661
They had the gift of crime.

41:31.867 --> 41:34.631
- You have more money than me.
- It was my idea.

41:34.836 --> 41:37.999
The only problem was running into
an older hoodlum...

41:38.206 --> 41:41.437
...like my brother, Goose.
- Li'l Dice?

41:41.643 --> 41:44.976
Shit, man. I thought
you were a goner at the motel.

41:45.180 --> 41:47.876
You're fucking loaded!

41:48.083 --> 41:51.746
Don't, Benny. That's our money.

41:52.287 --> 41:56.656
Benny, tell your brother Shaggy...

41:56.858 --> 42:01.386
that Shorty is squealing.
I'm leaving the ghetto.

42:03.965 --> 42:05.432
Goose!

42:07.836 --> 42:11.272
From Shaggy. You'll need it.

42:31.326 --> 42:33.954
From one hit to the next,
Li'l Dice grew up.

42:34.162 --> 42:38.565
At 18, he was the most
respected hood in the City of God.

42:38.767 --> 42:40.826
You're of age now, watch out!

42:41.036 --> 42:44.335
He was one of the most
wanted robbers in Rio.

42:57.619 --> 42:59.280
Li'l Dice, how's it going?

42:59.488 --> 43:03.117
Happy birthday.
I'm so glad you've turned 18...

43:03.325 --> 43:06.556
- Get lost, Tuba!
- Excuse me, amigo...

43:07.195 --> 43:09.254
Give me a beer!

43:09.464 --> 43:13.093
Didn't you see me, prick?

43:13.301 --> 43:15.166
- Sorry, man.
- Up yours!

43:15.370 --> 43:18.737
The next time,
l'll waste you, asshole!

43:20.142 --> 43:22.167
Fag!

43:22.511 --> 43:25.446
Li'I Dice was ready for anything.

43:25.647 --> 43:27.581
I wanna talk.

43:27.782 --> 43:30.774
- And he was itching to start.
- Who are the fattest cats here?

43:31.219 --> 43:35.451
- There are tons of them.
- Look at Jerry Adriani...

43:35.657 --> 43:39.753
gold chain, snazzy clothes.

43:39.961 --> 43:42.156
Look at Pereira
and the chick he's with...

43:42.364 --> 43:46.232
- Bernice. She was my brother's girl.
- Check out his car.

43:46.835 --> 43:50.965
Then there's Blacky.
Covered in gold.

43:51.173 --> 43:53.835
Gold chain, gold watch...

43:54.042 --> 43:57.205
Look at Carrot, and his car.

43:57.412 --> 44:01.143
- They're all dealers.
- They're all fucking loaded.

44:01.349 --> 44:03.374
Hold-ups bring in chickenshit.

44:03.585 --> 44:06.383
- The big bucks are in drugs.
- I see.

44:06.588 --> 44:08.579
Especially in selling coke.

44:08.790 --> 44:11.054
- But you need money.
- Not really...

44:11.259 --> 44:14.956
We'll kill these clowns
and take over their business.

44:15.163 --> 44:17.927
- When do we start?
- Now.

44:27.442 --> 44:31.401
Exu-the-Devil is the light
that shines forth.

44:31.613 --> 44:34.207
He brought you here.

44:34.416 --> 44:39.615
Why remain in the City of God
where God has forgotten you?

44:40.488 --> 44:44.891
I know what you want.
You want power.

44:45.093 --> 44:49.223
I have something which will
give it to you.

44:50.765 --> 44:55.259
To change your fate,
I give you my protector, boy.

44:55.470 --> 44:59.065
But you mustn't fornicate
with the amulet...

44:59.274 --> 45:01.742
otherwise...

45:02.811 --> 45:05.211
you'll die.

45:05.714 --> 45:08.114
The boy is no longer called
Li'l Dice...

45:08.316 --> 45:10.307
but Li'l Z'.

45:10.518 --> 45:14.079
Li'l Z' will grow up.

45:14.389 --> 45:18.189
You stick with me,
l'll stick with you.

45:29.471 --> 45:32.929
Li'l Dice became Li'I Z'
and he began to kill.

45:33.975 --> 45:40.642
He started one morning,
taking over Jerry Adriani's racket.

45:41.850 --> 45:46.219
By that night, almost all
of the rackets in the ghetto were his.

45:46.421 --> 45:49.822
The only business he didn't
touch was Carrot's...

45:50.025 --> 45:53.984
since he was a friend of Benny's.
All that was left was the apartment...

45:54.195 --> 45:55.253
But that would be easy.

46:00.035 --> 46:03.095
Who is it?

46:09.844 --> 46:11.709
- Hey, Blacky.
- Fuck, Li'l Dice.

46:11.913 --> 46:18.045
- You show up like this at my place?
- Who said it was your place?

46:18.253 --> 46:19.880
- Something wrong, Li'l Dice?
- Li'l Dice, my ass.

46:20.088 --> 46:23.546
- My name is Li'l Z' now.
- His name's Li'l Z', see?

46:23.758 --> 46:26.886
- You're a goner, bastard.
- Don't kill him. He understands.

46:27.095 --> 46:29.222
Right, Blacky?

46:29.431 --> 46:33.959
It's all yours, I don't want anything.
I don't want no trouble, okay?

46:34.169 --> 46:37.297
I should have taken this chance
to avenge my brother's death.

46:39.174 --> 46:43.873
You'll live, but you'll
work for us. Understand?

46:44.079 --> 46:46.172
That's easy to say...

46:47.515 --> 46:50.712
- Where are you going?
- He's clean, Li'l Z'.

46:51.286 --> 46:52.719
What's your name, kid?

46:52.921 --> 46:56.721
- Rocket.
- He's Goose's brother.

46:56.925 --> 46:59.519
- Goose?
- The late Goose.

47:00.729 --> 47:02.993
Quick, kid. Run along.

47:03.198 --> 47:07.658
Tell everyone that this business
now belongs to Li'l Z'.

47:07.869 --> 47:11.771
And that we'll be selling coke.
Got that?

47:12.140 --> 47:13.869
Cocaine.

47:16.878 --> 47:19.813
- Where's the turf?
- Over there, on the left.

47:20.014 --> 47:23.040
Selling drugs is like any
other business.

47:23.385 --> 47:25.285
The supplier
delivers the merchandise...

47:25.487 --> 47:28.217
which is then
packaged on the premises.

47:28.556 --> 47:32.356
It's done in an assembly line.

47:32.560 --> 47:34.619
Boring as hell...

47:35.096 --> 47:39.123
Pot is wrapped up in "lids".

47:39.401 --> 47:42.097
Cocaine is put into packets...

47:42.837 --> 47:47.069
and then into bundles
of 10 or 100.

47:47.442 --> 47:50.309
You can even make a career
in dealing drugs.

47:50.512 --> 47:54.346
The kids start out
as delivery boys.

47:54.616 --> 47:58.609
They're paid to run errands
and take messages.

47:59.354 --> 48:02.346
Then they become lookouts.
If the police arrive...

48:02.557 --> 48:05.390
the kites disappear
and everyone scrams.

48:06.661 --> 48:10.256
Later, you become a dealer
or a "vapor".

48:10.465 --> 48:13.559
When the heat's on, the
"vapor" quickly evaporates.

48:13.768 --> 48:17.898
Moving up the ladder,
you have the "soldier".

48:18.139 --> 48:21.734
And if the guy is good at math,
he can become a manager...

48:21.943 --> 48:25.401
the boss' right-hand man.

48:26.848 --> 48:30.784
The police receive their part
and don't make trouble.

48:32.987 --> 48:35.581
Since Li'l Z' killed off
all of his enemies...

48:35.790 --> 48:40.750
there were no shoot-outs in the
City of God. You could drive there...

48:41.129 --> 48:44.656
The playboys felt safe
buying their drugs there.

48:46.100 --> 48:50.764
The City teemed with addicts
and Li'l Z' grew rich.

48:51.706 --> 48:54.004
- Is it okay?
- It's a deal.

48:57.679 --> 49:01.706
- I can't decide which to wear.
- This one's cool.

49:02.550 --> 49:06.919
If dealing were legal, Li'l Z'
would have been man of the year.

49:10.191 --> 49:13.126
But things were risky for me.
I was afraid of him.

49:13.328 --> 49:17.526
- And he was everywhere.
- What a drag this guy is.

49:17.732 --> 49:22.863
Whenever I wanted to smoke a joint
I had to go see Carrot.

49:27.475 --> 49:30.376
Half a lid. Thanks.

49:31.513 --> 49:35.677
But it was worth it.
I only smoked with Angelica.

49:37.352 --> 49:40.219
She and Thiago had split up,
so I made my move.

49:40.421 --> 49:46.223
- I was about to win her over...
- These pictures are really great.

49:46.427 --> 49:50.022
- You think so?
- I look good here.

49:50.231 --> 49:52.995
- You look beautiful everywhere.
- I'm serious.

49:53.201 --> 49:54.190
Me too.

49:57.105 --> 50:02.338
A setting sun,
a deserted beach... a long kiss...

50:02.544 --> 50:05.377
I was sure this was it...

50:06.080 --> 50:08.571
But the Runts arrived.

50:09.150 --> 50:12.415
Can I have a toke?

50:17.992 --> 50:19.186
Here.

50:19.394 --> 50:23.592
I'm going. See you later.

50:25.466 --> 50:28.765
Hold on, Angelica.

50:28.970 --> 50:31.461
- Your joint, man.
- Keep it.

50:31.673 --> 50:34.005
What a cool guy.

50:36.978 --> 50:41.347
That was my first run
in with the Runts.

50:47.220 --> 50:50.280
- Steak and fries, Benny.
- Great! Here...

50:53.794 --> 50:59.733
- A tip for you.
- Really? Thanks.

50:59.933 --> 51:02.231
- Wanna eat something?
- No.

51:05.439 --> 51:09.637
- Wanna trade this watch?
- After Angelica left him...

51:09.843 --> 51:11.743
Thiago began snorting
more and more.

51:11.945 --> 51:15.039
- Is it your grandfather's?
- No, my dad's.

51:15.248 --> 51:19.548
When a guy is really hooked
he ends up in the hands of the dealer.

51:19.753 --> 51:21.880
- Two bags of ten.
- One of ten.

51:22.089 --> 51:26.185
- Okay, one bag.
- For Thiago, it was different.

51:26.393 --> 51:29.885
- Watch out!
- Sorry, godfather.

51:30.263 --> 51:33.061
Godfather, my ass.
Did I baptize your kids?

51:33.266 --> 51:36.292
- I'm sorry.
- Now beat it.

51:38.905 --> 51:42.898
Blacky, lend me your bike.

52:06.366 --> 52:08.630
Hey, wanna race?

52:08.835 --> 52:12.293
- Where to?
- Up to the highway.

52:12.906 --> 52:15.841
- Okay.
- Ready? Go!

52:38.231 --> 52:42.065
- Pretty tough, wasn't it?
- Yeah, you're good.

52:42.269 --> 52:44.601
Where'd you buy those sneakers?

52:44.804 --> 52:47.398
- Not far from here.
- The shirt, as well?

52:47.607 --> 52:49.939
- No, uptown.
- Cool.

52:50.143 --> 52:52.373
It's a designer shirt.

52:52.579 --> 52:54.911
If I give you money
can you buy me one?

52:55.115 --> 52:57.777
Shorts and a shirt?

53:00.020 --> 53:02.318
Buy whatever you can.

53:04.991 --> 53:07.050
- What size are you?
- Measure me.

53:07.260 --> 53:10.195
- With what, man?
- Shit, with your hand.

53:11.698 --> 53:14.428
Shoe size? Turn around.

53:23.210 --> 53:28.170
- Hey, Benny!
- You got the digs?

53:31.184 --> 53:34.449
- Just one pair of pants?
- No, there's more.

53:39.593 --> 53:40.855
- You like it?
- Yeah.

53:42.128 --> 53:44.460
There's some change.

53:45.031 --> 53:47.966
- Keep it.
- Cool.

53:56.476 --> 53:59.070
This is Benny.

54:00.180 --> 54:03.775
- This is Rocket.
- Hi. I know him.

54:28.241 --> 54:30.903
I've become a playboy.

54:32.846 --> 54:36.976
Hey, gangsters, listen to this...

54:37.183 --> 54:39.014
Watch out...

54:39.219 --> 54:42.882
Groovies shake their asses
before laying a big one.

54:46.359 --> 54:48.088
Oh, yeah?

54:48.962 --> 54:51.658
Fuck off, you bastards!

54:54.000 --> 54:57.800
Making fun of me?

54:59.072 --> 55:01.267
Asshole!

55:16.189 --> 55:20.387
Benny, didn't I tell you to shoot Carrot?
He's endangering the ghetto.

55:20.593 --> 55:24.120
- Cool it. Go talk to him.
- I'm gonna kill that fucker.

55:24.331 --> 55:27.198
- Stop trying to wipe out everyone.
- I'm gonna kill him.

55:29.536 --> 55:32.528
Don't worry, Angelica.
The guys in here are cool.

55:32.739 --> 55:35.333
Sure, l'm not worried.

55:35.809 --> 55:39.643
You gonna dance, Benny?
What about Carrot?

55:39.846 --> 55:43.907
Go on, buddy. Go talk to the guy.

55:44.117 --> 55:47.678
Benny was the coolest hood
in the City of God.

55:47.887 --> 55:51.050
He gave away pot,
paid for drinks.

55:51.558 --> 55:54.652
Li'l Z' was the opposite.
He had one obsession:

55:54.861 --> 55:56.829
To be the boss of the ghetto.

55:57.030 --> 56:00.295
He wanted an excuse to take over
Carrot's racket.

56:00.500 --> 56:02.127
- Hey, Carrot.
- What's up?

56:02.335 --> 56:06.635
You shouldn't let the Runts
do hold-ups in the ghetto.

56:07.207 --> 56:10.005
You look after your section,
l'll look after mine.

56:10.210 --> 56:14.078
Got that? I'm gonna get a drink.

56:21.955 --> 56:26.858
- Hey, Rocket! How's it going?
- Great.

56:27.060 --> 56:30.120
- Hey, Benny!
- How's it going?

56:30.897 --> 56:33.866
- Hey, Thiago. How are you?
- Good.

56:34.934 --> 56:36.401
- May I?
- Sure...

56:36.603 --> 56:38.901
Wanna dance?

56:42.409 --> 56:45.867
- Is it okay at your place?
- No problem.

56:46.079 --> 56:49.742
My parents are out.
You'll be all alone with her.

56:49.949 --> 56:54.352
- You can lose your virginity tonight.
- Not so loud, man!

56:54.554 --> 56:56.283
Everyone will hear.

56:57.524 --> 56:59.924
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

57:00.126 --> 57:04.586
- Shit!
- Nothing's happening.

57:11.805 --> 57:16.105
Look, man, I know the Runts
are associated with you.

57:16.309 --> 57:19.972
Think I'm a sucker, you little brat?
You want to take my racket?

57:20.180 --> 57:24.378
I want to talk to you
because you're fucking useless.

57:24.584 --> 57:25.573
Get your hand away!

57:25.785 --> 57:28.811
The Runts are screwing up
our security, man.

57:29.022 --> 57:30.353
Give the baby his bottle.

57:30.557 --> 57:32.957
Carrot, just ask the kids
to cool it, okay?

57:33.159 --> 57:36.560
Carrot's useless. He lets the Runts
do hold-ups in his section.

57:36.763 --> 57:39.698
The police come around and
that's bad for business.

57:39.966 --> 57:43.561
I'll do it only because
I like you.

57:43.903 --> 57:45.564
But you need to change
that baby's diapers.

57:45.772 --> 57:49.606
I'll show you who's the baby...

57:49.809 --> 57:55.304
Tell the kids that in my ghetto
no one robs or rapes!

57:55.515 --> 57:56.982
No wonder you're "Little" Z'!

58:00.153 --> 58:05.090
The Runts were kids who didn't
respect the laws of the ghetto.

58:05.291 --> 58:08.749
They would mug residents,
hold up bakeries...

58:08.962 --> 58:11.157
especially in Carrot's section.

58:14.100 --> 58:17.661
What are you doing?

58:19.439 --> 58:23.933
- You rob me all the time!
- But they didn't know...

58:24.143 --> 58:26.475
that the City had a boss now.

58:28.348 --> 58:30.373
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING US

58:30.583 --> 58:34.417
The City had become
much safer for residents.

58:35.755 --> 58:38.622
There were hardly
any hold-ups now.

58:38.858 --> 58:40.155
You just had to go see Li'l Z'.

58:40.360 --> 58:43.488
- Let's go.
- Don't hurt the Runts.

58:43.696 --> 58:46.597
I won't touch them.

58:50.270 --> 58:52.238
- Hi, Steak.
- How's it going, Li'l Z'?

58:52.438 --> 58:55.134
- Wanna take a walk, Steak?
- With you? Hold on...

58:57.577 --> 59:00.569
Mom, l'm going out with
my friends.

59:13.026 --> 59:15.688
That's the best chicken
I ever ate.

59:16.162 --> 59:20.223
- The old guy was scared shitless.
- Feeling sorry for him?

59:20.433 --> 59:23.459
You're crazy, man!

59:31.878 --> 59:34.745
Why not stick up
a bank or a supermarket?

59:34.948 --> 59:39.385
- Peanuts. Drugs are where it's at.
- Yeah, selling drugs.

59:39.586 --> 59:45.889
But you have to start out as a delivery
boy. You wanna be a delivery boy?

59:46.092 --> 59:51.325
It's a rip off.
It takes a long time to move up.

59:51.631 --> 59:55.965
You have to wait till an older guy
gets killed to move up.

59:56.202 --> 59:59.365
I don't wanna wait till some guy
croaks. I'm gonna do what Li'l Z' did.

59:59.572 --> 01:00:02.268
I'm gonna wipe them all out.

01:00:02.475 --> 01:00:05.308
Talking about me, kid?
The boss is here.

01:00:09.415 --> 01:00:10.973
Come back, you brat!

01:00:15.355 --> 01:00:22.022
- They're quick, those kids.
- They run fast.

01:00:23.262 --> 01:00:26.163
They're all gone except you.
Any others?

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.402
You're gonna pay
for the ones that escaped.

01:00:36.609 --> 01:00:40.773
You choose. Shall I shoot you
in the hand or foot?

01:00:41.381 --> 01:00:43.281
Come on, choose!

01:00:43.483 --> 01:00:46.247
Hand or foot?

01:00:48.788 --> 01:00:51.518
Choose, for fuck's sake!

01:00:59.265 --> 01:01:02.393
- Hand.
- The little hand, eh?

01:01:11.277 --> 01:01:13.370
Cool.

01:01:14.647 --> 01:01:19.050
Hey, Steak'n'fries,
let's see what you're made of.

01:01:19.252 --> 01:01:22.585
Choose and then kill
one of them.

01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:26.589
- Leave it. I'll do it.
- Butt out, Tuba. This is for him.

01:01:29.429 --> 01:01:31.260
Go on, Steak.

01:01:31.464 --> 01:01:34.900
Go on, choose one and shoot.

01:01:35.101 --> 01:01:38.127
Come on, I haven't got all day.

01:01:38.337 --> 01:01:41.170
Kill one of them.

01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:47.504
Let's go, Steak.
I'm in a hurry.

01:01:47.714 --> 01:01:51.081
I wanna see what you're made of.

01:01:58.758 --> 01:02:02.091
Well done!

01:02:02.295 --> 01:02:03.523
You did it.

01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:09.530
- You're one of us. Give me five.
- Very good, Steak.

01:02:12.205 --> 01:02:18.872
Get up, brat. Go back
to your rat hole. Without limping!

01:02:19.712 --> 01:02:24.012
Tell your buddies that no one
robs in Li'l Z”s ghetto.

01:02:24.217 --> 01:02:26.981
Go now.
And no limping, okay?

01:02:29.288 --> 01:02:31.518
Cool, Li'l Z'.

01:02:44.103 --> 01:02:47.766
While Li'l Z' was winning
the respect of the residents...

01:02:48.241 --> 01:02:51.210
Benny was winning
Angelica's heart.

01:02:51.744 --> 01:02:56.374
As for me, I was still
a virgin, single and broke.

01:02:56.582 --> 01:02:58.846
I had no choice.

01:02:59.952 --> 01:03:02.887
SUCKER'S LIFE

01:03:03.089 --> 01:03:06.820
I had to take a job
in a supermarket.

01:03:07.026 --> 01:03:11.554
I worked long hours for chicken feed.
I wanted to be laid off...

01:03:11.764 --> 01:03:15.791
so I could buy a camera
with the severance pay.

01:03:17.003 --> 01:03:20.131
But things didn't
work out that way.

01:03:23.209 --> 01:03:25.871
- It's the guy on the beach.
- Hey, bro!

01:03:26.078 --> 01:03:28.774
- Still smoking good stuff?
- Yeah.

01:03:28.981 --> 01:03:30.642
That guy's too cool.

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:33.410
Hey, kid. Come here.
Lift up your shirt.

01:03:38.424 --> 01:03:41.791
We give these ghetto kids a chance
and they don't appreciate it.

01:03:41.994 --> 01:03:45.486
- What about my severance pay?
- What severance pay?

01:03:45.698 --> 01:03:49.657
That fucking manager thought
I was part of the gang.

01:03:49.869 --> 01:03:55.034
You're fired for serious misconduct.
Get out. Immediately!

01:03:55.241 --> 01:03:58.699
I didn't get a single cent.

01:04:12.491 --> 01:04:14.652
It was like a message from God:

01:04:16.963 --> 01:04:20.797
"Honesty doesn't pay, sucker'."

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.265
FLIRTING WITH CRIME

01:04:33.446 --> 01:04:37.177
The bus sure took a long time to come.
I should already be at work.

01:04:37.984 --> 01:04:41.385
Shit, hide that gun.
Are you nuts?

01:04:41.587 --> 01:04:43.248
It was Goose's.
It's broken anyway.

01:04:43.456 --> 01:04:46.516
It's not our fault, the company
runs few buses on this line.

01:04:46.759 --> 01:04:51.355
It's never anyone's fault.
It's always someone else's.

01:04:51.564 --> 01:04:55.523
But it's the workers who suffer.
And then, they make us squeeze!

01:04:55.735 --> 01:04:57.862
Have a nice evening, ma'am.

01:05:00.373 --> 01:05:02.739
I know that guy.

01:05:02.942 --> 01:05:05.035
He lives in the City.
He'll recognize us.

01:05:05.244 --> 01:05:07.838
So? He couldn't care less
if we take his boss' money.

01:05:08.047 --> 01:05:10.311
Okay. Let's go.

01:05:13.219 --> 01:05:16.677
Well, boys? Aren't you from
the City of God?

01:05:17.123 --> 01:05:18.420
Yeah.

01:05:18.624 --> 01:05:21.787
I'll let one of you through
without paying.

01:05:26.065 --> 01:05:30.195
You should study
so you can get out of the ghetto.

01:05:30.403 --> 01:05:33.270
It's too full of cops and
hoodlums.

01:05:33.472 --> 01:05:37.340
- Did you study?
- I was in school and in the army.

01:05:37.543 --> 01:05:40.706
I was the best marksman
in my barracks.

01:05:40.913 --> 01:05:43.438
This job was all
I could find afterwards.

01:05:43.649 --> 01:05:47.847
But I do karate.
If l'm hired somewhere...

01:05:48.054 --> 01:05:50.147
l'll leave the ghetto.

01:05:50.656 --> 01:05:55.116
- Do you fight, then?
- I'm for peace and love.

01:05:55.494 --> 01:05:56.961
But if I have to...

01:05:57.163 --> 01:05:59.961
He didn't know he would have to.

01:06:00.166 --> 01:06:03.727
But not yet, it's not time
to tell Knockout Ned's story.

01:06:04.303 --> 01:06:06.464
- We should be going.
- Let's go.

01:06:06.672 --> 01:06:07.661
- Good bye.
- Thanks.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.371
See you.

01:06:14.647 --> 01:06:17.377
I couldn't do it.
He was such a cool guy.

01:06:17.583 --> 01:06:20.746
Yeah, totally.
That's Gerson's brother.

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:23.952
Let's go home.

01:06:26.092 --> 01:06:30.153
There's nothing here
except that bakery over there.

01:06:30.363 --> 01:06:35.232
- What will you say?
- I don't know. "This is a hold-up."

01:06:37.336 --> 01:06:38.928
Here's my number.

01:06:39.138 --> 01:06:41.333
- You like soul or groovy parties?
- Soul.

01:06:41.707 --> 01:06:43.470
That one didn't work either.

01:06:43.676 --> 01:06:47.009
The counter girl was just too foxy.
And she flirted with me.

01:06:47.213 --> 01:06:48.373
Will you call me?

01:06:49.615 --> 01:06:53.176
I couldn't pull a gun on her,
she was too sweet.

01:06:53.386 --> 01:06:55.183
Yeah, I agree.

01:07:02.194 --> 01:07:05.163
Excuse me. I'm lost.
How do I get to Barra?

01:07:05.364 --> 01:07:06.353
- To Barra?
- Yes.

01:07:06.565 --> 01:07:09.363
I thought: "Tough luck
for this guy from Sao Paulo."

01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:12.594
- In fact, we were going there.
- You're kidding.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:17.175
- You're a lifesaver.
- That's right.

01:07:17.943 --> 01:07:21.344
Because no guy from Sao Paulo
could ever be cool.

01:07:28.821 --> 01:07:32.052
- The body's over here.
- We found it, Chief.

01:07:32.258 --> 01:07:34.749
The forensic expert!

01:07:50.242 --> 01:07:52.335
- Not a pretty sight, eh?
- You said it.

01:07:52.545 --> 01:07:54.843
- What a great singer.
- You like him?

01:07:55.047 --> 01:08:00.383
- I love music. What about you?
- Tell me, do you also like pot?

01:08:03.689 --> 01:08:06.180
I can't say l've never tried it.

01:08:06.392 --> 01:08:09.520
The devil recognizes his own.

01:08:11.597 --> 01:08:14.191
- Do you have papers?
- I think so.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.834
I have some.

01:08:19.438 --> 01:08:22.202
I'd always been an ace
at rolling a joint.

01:08:22.408 --> 01:08:24.808
If l'd had the same skill
with girls...

01:08:25.611 --> 01:08:29.774
l'd never have lost so many chances
to lose my virginity.

01:08:31.884 --> 01:08:36.651
- For a Sao Paulo guy you're very cool.
- Thanks, bro.

01:08:36.856 --> 01:08:39.756
What did they use?

01:08:40.126 --> 01:08:44.153
A club or a rock.
And the child?

01:08:44.363 --> 01:08:47.298
- Untouched.
- Thank goodness.

01:08:47.765 --> 01:08:52.260
- How long ago?
- About four hours.

01:08:52.805 --> 01:08:55.466
- Can we take it away?
- Go ahead.

01:08:56.841 --> 01:09:00.778
The murderer has to be
from the City of God.

01:09:19.564 --> 01:09:24.093
You bastard!
You motherfucker!

01:09:24.803 --> 01:09:27.738
Did you have to kill
your chick in the ghetto?

01:09:27.939 --> 01:09:30.932
- The place is crawling with cops now!
- Come on, Li'l Z'.

01:09:31.143 --> 01:09:35.603
- Come on? Fuck you!
- I had to avenge my honor.

01:09:35.814 --> 01:09:39.305
Her family's turned me in.
You won't have any problems.

01:09:39.518 --> 01:09:43.010
The cops are everywhere because
of you. You're dead meat, asshole.

01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:46.089
Let up, Li'l Z'.
You've punished him enough.

01:09:46.292 --> 01:09:48.419
You know the law.

01:09:48.627 --> 01:09:51.288
Anyone who kills in my ghetto
has to die as an example.

01:09:51.497 --> 01:09:54.091
That was his business, Li'l Z'.

01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:56.894
Listen, you sonofabitch,
get outta the ghetto.

01:09:57.102 --> 01:09:59.195
You showed no respect, understand?

01:10:02.741 --> 01:10:04.038
You know what, Benny?

01:10:04.243 --> 01:10:07.804
You're too nice. If you raise
a snake, expect to get bitten.

01:10:08.013 --> 01:10:10.880
He wasn't worth shit.

01:10:11.283 --> 01:10:14.081
- A dirty traitor.
- Shut up, Tuba.

01:10:14.286 --> 01:10:16.652
I'm going for a walk
with my girl.

01:10:16.855 --> 01:10:22.020
Okay, be careful.
When things calm down...

01:10:22.228 --> 01:10:25.254
we'll get back to our business
with Carrot, okay?

01:10:30.202 --> 01:10:33.262
You need a girlfriend, Li'l Z'.

01:10:53.591 --> 01:10:55.821
Know what l'm thinking, Benny?

01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:58.952
That l'm so sexy?

01:10:59.164 --> 01:11:02.725
That too. But I mean,
you know what we could do?

01:11:02.934 --> 01:11:06.426
- Make love again.
- I'm serious.

01:11:07.071 --> 01:11:11.735
We could go away from here.
This violence sucks.

01:11:12.977 --> 01:11:14.342
Go where?

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.080
To a farm.

01:11:18.783 --> 01:11:22.651
We're really hippies at heart,
aren't we?

01:11:24.055 --> 01:11:26.182
A farm?

01:11:29.561 --> 01:11:32.121
Peace and love?

01:11:51.983 --> 01:11:56.716
BENNY'S FAREWELL

01:12:05.396 --> 01:12:08.695
Benny was just too cool
to go on being a hoodlum.

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:12.529
He succeeded in getting everybody
together for his good-bye party.

01:12:12.737 --> 01:12:14.034
The gangs...

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.699
The soul crowd...

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:27.646
- The religious crowd...
- One day, l'll go to church.

01:12:27.852 --> 01:12:29.786
The samba crowd...

01:12:33.458 --> 01:12:35.653
The groovy crowd...

01:12:38.463 --> 01:12:42.456
And Li'l Z', who had never
danced in his life.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:06.347
Want to dance with me?
Want to dance with me?

01:13:06.557 --> 01:13:08.957
- I didn't hear...
- Want to dance?

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.254
No, thank you, l'm with someone.

01:13:26.878 --> 01:13:28.505
Hey, Rocket!

01:13:42.427 --> 01:13:45.863
Come, I want to talk
to you, buddy.

01:13:46.831 --> 01:13:49.891
- You can't just split with that chick.
- Why not?

01:13:50.101 --> 01:13:54.299
I'm gonna go live on a farm,
smoke pot, listen to rock.

01:13:54.505 --> 01:13:58.305
You wanna throw away everything
we've accomplished for that bitch?

01:13:58.943 --> 01:14:02.003
She's not a bitch, she's my girl.

01:14:02.213 --> 01:14:04.807
We'll take over Carrot's business,
it'll be yours.

01:14:05.016 --> 01:14:08.349
- Leave Carrot alone, he's a good guy.
- He's a motherfucker!

01:14:08.553 --> 01:14:11.852
See? Everyone's a motherfucker
to you. That's why l'm leaving.

01:14:12.056 --> 01:14:15.753
I'm your friend,
but l'm getting out.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:18.190
You got to understand,
I have to go.

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:23.767
I love you, man,
but l've had enough.

01:15:22.994 --> 01:15:25.360
Motherfucker, let's see
if you have any balls.

01:15:25.563 --> 01:15:29.158
- What is this?
- You wanna die? Fuck off, bitch!

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:32.897
Strip, nigger.
I wanna see your ass.

01:15:33.104 --> 01:15:37.473
Hurry up!
Take it all off! Now!

01:15:38.209 --> 01:15:41.235
I wanna see your ass.
Come on, faggot!

01:15:41.646 --> 01:15:44.240
Let's go, nigger!

01:15:54.225 --> 01:15:57.194
Show your ass to everyone!

01:15:57.795 --> 01:15:59.422
Please...

01:16:04.469 --> 01:16:07.029
- Strip, dammit!
- Hurry it up!

01:16:18.816 --> 01:16:22.183
What's up, Benny?
This camera for a bag of coke?

01:16:22.386 --> 01:16:27.016
- I don't deal anymore.
- C'mon, do it for me. You're my friend.

01:16:27.225 --> 01:16:29.887
- Is it stolen?
- It's okay, it's my dad's.

01:16:30.628 --> 01:16:32.619
Your dad's?

01:16:33.698 --> 01:16:38.931
- Give it to Li'l Z'.
- Rocket would love this camera.

01:16:43.074 --> 01:16:44.803
- Yeah, here.
- Great.

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.666
Here I am!

01:17:11.869 --> 01:17:13.996
- You wanna be a photographer?
- Yeah.

01:17:14.405 --> 01:17:19.206
- Here's a present.
- Shit, dude! This is great!

01:17:19.977 --> 01:17:24.175
Now move your ass.
Shake it!

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.226
You'll take some great pictures.

01:17:48.105 --> 01:17:50.073
Give me that.

01:17:55.313 --> 01:18:01.548
- Give me back the camera!
- No!

01:18:04.488 --> 01:18:11.155
What's your problem?
Are you crazy?

01:18:38.356 --> 01:18:41.917
They've killed Benny!

01:18:43.527 --> 01:18:48.464
Fuck! Call an ambulance!
Where's the motherfucker who did it?

01:18:49.266 --> 01:18:54.294
- Z', Benny is dead.
- No! Call a doctor!

01:18:59.844 --> 01:19:04.440
Get out of here, bitch!
It's your fault!

01:19:06.717 --> 01:19:08.844
Motherfucker!

01:19:32.910 --> 01:19:35.344
Where's Carrot?

01:19:35.546 --> 01:19:37.207
Blacky's here.

01:19:39.617 --> 01:19:42.177
He's in trouble.

01:19:44.255 --> 01:19:45.984
I'm fucked.

01:19:46.457 --> 01:19:48.448
- Why?
- I'm fucked.

01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:51.526
And you are too.
I think I killed Benny.

01:19:51.729 --> 01:19:53.856
Li'l Z' is coming
to take your place.

01:19:54.065 --> 01:19:56.329
We can get him,
he's in the dance hall.

01:19:56.534 --> 01:19:58.161
You killed Benny?

01:19:58.369 --> 01:20:01.896
I didn't mean to. He moved.
I was aiming at Li'l Z'.

01:20:02.106 --> 01:20:04.267
Come on, let's go.

01:20:04.475 --> 01:20:06.966
Blacky...

01:20:07.178 --> 01:20:09.806
You killed the coolest
hood in the City of God.

01:20:10.014 --> 01:20:12.278
Let's go get Li'l Z'.

01:20:20.257 --> 01:20:24.921
Carrot knew that without Benny only
a miracle could save his business.

01:20:25.129 --> 01:20:28.223
We're fucked, man.

01:20:37.808 --> 01:20:43.110
But what better place for a miracle to
happen than in the City of God?

01:20:46.751 --> 01:20:48.651
Look who's here.
My sugar babe.

01:20:48.853 --> 01:20:50.514
- Let me by.
- Gimme a kiss, girl.

01:20:50.721 --> 01:20:54.680
Let me by, please.
Have you seen what you look like?

01:20:56.727 --> 01:20:59.787
Come on, Li'l Z'.

01:21:08.272 --> 01:21:10.763
Hi, honey.
Everything okay, baby?

01:21:18.415 --> 01:21:25.082
The problem was simple. Li'l Z' was
ugly. Knockout Ned was handsome.

01:21:25.289 --> 01:21:31.353
Knockout Ned could get any girl.
Li'l Z' had to pay or use force.

01:21:32.029 --> 01:21:35.624
It was a duel between
the handsome good guy...

01:21:36.133 --> 01:21:37.998
and the ugly bad guy.

01:21:38.202 --> 01:21:40.762
- Let me go!
- Just enjoy it.

01:21:48.078 --> 01:21:53.539
There's no use fighting.
You're mine now.

01:21:57.788 --> 01:22:00.985
Hey, faggot, your broad's
really hot!

01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:35.588
I can't even look her in
the face now.

01:22:45.636 --> 01:22:49.072
Why didn't that fucker kill me?

01:22:53.177 --> 01:22:57.273
Hold on...
Why didn't I kill that fucker?

01:22:57.781 --> 01:22:59.646
Let's go back.

01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:02.648
- What about Carrot?
- We'll get back to him.

01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:04.081
You gonna kill him?

01:23:07.791 --> 01:23:11.852
Knockout Ned, your chick's a slut.
Come out, motherfucker!

01:23:12.062 --> 01:23:17.500
- Come out, you loser!
- Take it easy...

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:21.831
l'm going out. Let me go.

01:23:35.286 --> 01:23:37.311
Gerson! Come back, son!

01:23:47.865 --> 01:23:51.733
This doesn't concern you, kid.
We're here for your brother.

01:23:51.936 --> 01:23:55.303
Let's talk, we can work it out.
My brother's a peaceful guy.

01:23:55.506 --> 01:23:58.703
Is he too good-looking
to come talk to me? Call him.

01:23:58.909 --> 01:24:00.171
He hasn't done anything.

01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:04.043
You know who I am?

01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:07.308
- Li'l Z', man.
- He's Li'l Z'.

01:24:07.918 --> 01:24:10.785
Call that motherfucker!

01:24:15.459 --> 01:24:18.326
Go on, man.

01:24:18.862 --> 01:24:21.126
Calm down, l'll call him.

01:24:54.732 --> 01:24:58.133
My arm! I hurt my arm.
Carrot will have to wait.

01:24:58.335 --> 01:25:00.667
That loser got what he deserved.

01:25:00.871 --> 01:25:02.862
Let's go!

01:25:26.597 --> 01:25:30.533
Gerson...

01:25:30.734 --> 01:25:34.329
That bastard killed my brother.

01:25:42.279 --> 01:25:45.043
I can't let that go.

01:26:00.264 --> 01:26:02.391
- Want a gun?
- My son...

01:26:02.599 --> 01:26:06.000
Calm down, mom.

01:26:06.837 --> 01:26:09.704
Please, mom...

01:26:18.515 --> 01:26:22.178
Do it right, asshole.

01:26:22.386 --> 01:26:26.117
- There's no other way.
- How'd I let that loser hit me?

01:26:26.323 --> 01:26:28.791
Shit, that's some hole.

01:26:58.522 --> 01:27:01.514
- It's as if we were brothers.
- Shut up.

01:27:01.725 --> 01:27:06.253
Both of us hurt in the arm.
You by one brother, me the other.

01:27:06.463 --> 01:27:10.263
It would be really funny
if we were brothers.

01:27:10.467 --> 01:27:16.565
That Knockout Ned's not bad, eh?
He came out of nowhere.

01:27:17.341 --> 01:27:20.970
Shut up, Tuba!
You're a fucking pain!

01:27:28.519 --> 01:27:32.683
It was as if the City of God
had suddenly found a hero.

01:27:32.890 --> 01:27:35.051
God bless you, son.

01:27:35.259 --> 01:27:38.524
That kid was just asking
to be killed.

01:27:38.729 --> 01:27:41.425
Well done.

01:27:41.632 --> 01:27:44.863
You did a good job.

01:27:45.068 --> 01:27:48.697
You'd better go hide.

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:54.573
I thought Knockout Ned
would start a revolution here.

01:27:54.778 --> 01:27:57.542
But God had other plans.

01:27:57.848 --> 01:28:01.443
Steak,
where are all the dealers?

01:28:01.652 --> 01:28:04.917
They're hiding.
Li'l Z' is in a bad mood.

01:28:05.122 --> 01:28:08.853
They get us hooked and then
they go off and hide.

01:28:09.059 --> 01:28:12.290
Do me a favor. Go get some
nose candy for me.

01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:13.895
I'll try.

01:28:14.097 --> 01:28:17.555
Tell them it's for Thiago,
to keep my buzz going.

01:28:38.154 --> 01:28:43.524
Steak'n'fries,
go to Carrot's and tell him...

01:28:43.726 --> 01:28:49.096
Li'l Z' says that if you kill
Knockout, he'll leave you alone.

01:28:49.732 --> 01:28:52.599
Hey, Knockout Ned.
Did you hear that?

01:28:52.802 --> 01:28:55.464
Grab the kid!

01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:03.306
You heard the boy? If you don't
stick with us, you're dead.

01:29:03.513 --> 01:29:06.778
I think you should join us.
We'll be partners.

01:29:07.450 --> 01:29:10.385
Drugs aren't my thing.

01:29:10.587 --> 01:29:12.714
This is just something
between me and him.

01:29:12.922 --> 01:29:17.586
Those guys aren't worth shit.

01:29:17.794 --> 01:29:21.389
They'll do anything for power.

01:29:21.598 --> 01:29:23.930
Like that kid.

01:29:24.133 --> 01:29:28.263
They're all robots,
like this punk here.

01:29:28.471 --> 01:29:30.735
What's in your head, kid?

01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:33.374
Can't you see you're
wrecking your life...

01:29:33.576 --> 01:29:37.808
with that maniac and a bunch
of trigger-happy fools?

01:29:39.282 --> 01:29:45.949
- Are you crazy? You're just a kid.
- A kid? I smoke, snort...

01:29:46.155 --> 01:29:49.454
l've killed and robbed.
I'm a man.

01:29:49.659 --> 01:29:52.184
Shit, you have no idea!

01:29:52.395 --> 01:29:55.626
He's attached to his gang.
You should join up with us.

01:29:55.832 --> 01:30:00.701
- Shall we kill him?
- Steak, we're going to grind you.

01:30:02.305 --> 01:30:06.537
- Okay, I accept.
- Great!

01:30:06.743 --> 01:30:10.839
Tell your boss that Knockout Ned
and Carrot are now in command.

01:30:11.047 --> 01:30:17.247
But on one condition:
No killing of innocent people.

01:30:18.888 --> 01:30:21.482
I can't accept that, understand?

01:30:21.691 --> 01:30:26.355
Okay, no innocent people.

01:30:27.764 --> 01:30:32.701
Steak fucked up!

01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:46.974
- Have you a gun for me?
- No...

01:30:47.183 --> 01:30:50.584
but we can hold up
a gun store.

01:30:50.787 --> 01:30:52.846
That's no problem.

01:30:53.056 --> 01:30:56.651
I don't want to hold up anything.
I'm not a hoodlum.

01:30:56.859 --> 01:31:00.056
This is a personal affair
between me and him, okay?

01:31:00.730 --> 01:31:02.994
I'm not a hoodlum.

01:31:05.368 --> 01:31:07.336
He raped your chick...

01:31:07.537 --> 01:31:11.371
killed your uncle and brother,
gunned your house...

01:31:11.574 --> 01:31:14.941
and you killed one of his guys.

01:31:19.281 --> 01:31:22.910
If you're not a hood,
then get out.

01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:32.427
THE STORY OF KNOCKOUT NED

01:31:33.595 --> 01:31:36.086
This is a hold-up!

01:31:44.139 --> 01:31:47.768
- The first time...
- Where are the revolvers?

01:31:47.976 --> 01:31:51.605
...Knockout Ned saved a salesclerk
from being shot by Carrot.

01:31:51.813 --> 01:31:56.216
We said no killing!

01:31:56.418 --> 01:31:58.215
That's the rule.

01:31:59.454 --> 01:32:04.687
We want the boss' money. Everyone
keep calm. Open the cash register!

01:32:04.893 --> 01:32:07.794
You want us to go?
We do too.

01:32:07.996 --> 01:32:10.430
So hurry up!

01:32:11.667 --> 01:32:14.067
- Look at the ground!
- The second time...

01:32:14.269 --> 01:32:16.203
Carrot saved
Knockout Ned's life.

01:32:18.974 --> 01:32:22.102
Ned learned that there's
an exception to every rule.

01:32:22.744 --> 01:32:25.076
Exception to the rule.

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:28.374
- Are you the manager?
- Yes.

01:32:28.583 --> 01:32:32.576
This is a hold-up.
Everyone on the ground!

01:32:32.788 --> 01:32:34.813
On the ground!

01:32:35.023 --> 01:32:39.255
Give me the money!

01:32:42.197 --> 01:32:44.427
I'm not kidding.

01:32:44.633 --> 01:32:46.863
The first person who moves
is dead!

01:32:47.269 --> 01:32:50.898
The third time, the exception
becomes the rule.

01:33:06.688 --> 01:33:11.057
Carrot and Knockout Ned
prepared to face Li'l Z'.

01:33:11.259 --> 01:33:14.057
Carrot could protect his
business.

01:33:14.329 --> 01:33:16.092
Knockout Ned...

01:33:16.298 --> 01:33:19.233
the best marksman in his battalion,
wanted revenge.

01:33:19.434 --> 01:33:23.632
First, the Italians.
This is a 9 mm.

01:33:24.373 --> 01:33:26.603
- Let me see.
- Not bad, eh?

01:33:26.808 --> 01:33:31.507
- The sight isn't well-aligned.
- I'll give you a good price.

01:33:32.314 --> 01:33:34.305
The 12 mm, the "hand job".

01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:36.178
See why?

01:33:36.385 --> 01:33:39.445
An Uzi, 9 mm. It's Israeli.

01:33:39.654 --> 01:33:42.521
- The star of David.
- Jewish.

01:33:42.724 --> 01:33:44.089
I want a 30-06.

01:33:44.559 --> 01:33:46.925
Now we can start having fun.

01:33:47.129 --> 01:33:51.463
The war's on.
Let's start with a prayer.

01:33:51.833 --> 01:33:55.929
Our Father who art in heaven
hallowed be our name...

01:33:56.138 --> 01:34:00.302
Our will be done...

01:34:00.842 --> 01:34:03.333
On earth as it is in heaven...

01:34:16.591 --> 01:34:18.650
Hoodlums have guns,
but can't shoot.

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:22.987
One bullet from Knockout Ned
was worth ten from Li'l Z”s gang.

01:34:23.198 --> 01:34:27.328
Li'l Z' couldn't take it.
He counter-attacked.

01:34:29.971 --> 01:34:34.203
The ghetto had been a purgatory,
now it was hell.

01:34:38.146 --> 01:34:43.846
I decided to get out.
That's how I became a reporter.

01:34:44.719 --> 01:34:47.153
Great photo!

01:34:47.355 --> 01:34:49.823
I bet it's by Rogerio Reis.

01:34:50.392 --> 01:34:53.225
What did I tell you?

01:34:53.428 --> 01:34:55.623
Like any pro...

01:34:55.831 --> 01:34:59.267
I started at the bottom,
way down at the bottom.

01:34:59.468 --> 01:35:02.926
Without knowing what awaited me.

01:35:04.573 --> 01:35:07.542
Instead of going home
l'd go over to the paper.

01:35:07.742 --> 01:35:11.109
A guy from the City of God
worked in the lab.

01:35:11.313 --> 01:35:14.180
Check this out.

01:35:14.382 --> 01:35:18.443
He helped me move closer to
what I loved most in life.

01:35:18.653 --> 01:35:20.280
- Hi, Rogerio.
- How are you, Pierre?

01:35:20.489 --> 01:35:23.117
This is Rocket.
He's a photographer.

01:35:23.325 --> 01:35:24.485
Hello, Rocket.

01:35:24.693 --> 01:35:26.957
- He's a fan of yours.
- Really?

01:35:27.162 --> 01:35:28.789
You have good taste, Rocket!

01:35:28.997 --> 01:35:32.091
- Well, l'm done. I'm off.
- See you.

01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.962
What a cool guy!

01:35:35.770 --> 01:35:38.864
What should have been
a swift revenge...

01:35:39.074 --> 01:35:41.565
turned into an all-out war.

01:35:46.681 --> 01:35:48.911
The City of God was divided.

01:35:49.117 --> 01:35:52.917
You couldn't go from one
section to the other.

01:35:53.121 --> 01:35:55.351
Not even to visit a relative.

01:35:55.557 --> 01:35:59.288
The cops considered anyone
living in the ghetto a hoodlum.

01:35:59.494 --> 01:36:02.930
People got used to living
in Vietnam.

01:36:07.135 --> 01:36:12.095
And more and more volunteers
kept signing up to die.

01:36:12.307 --> 01:36:13.296
This kid...

01:36:13.508 --> 01:36:16.238
- What do you want?
- A boy from Carrot's gang punched me.

01:36:16.778 --> 01:36:18.143
The war was
an excuse for everything.

01:36:18.547 --> 01:36:20.515
One of Li'l Z”s soldiers
kicked me.

01:36:22.551 --> 01:36:24.576
Take this.22.

01:36:26.388 --> 01:36:28.856
The jerk who raped my sister is
with Carrot.

01:36:29.057 --> 01:36:30.456
Li'l Z' evicted my family.

01:36:31.493 --> 01:36:33.120
Kill... Be respected.

01:36:45.507 --> 01:36:50.968
- I'm Thiago, a friend of Benny's.
- Can you read? Can you add?

01:36:51.179 --> 01:36:56.617
- I'm pretty good in business.
- Okay, get to work.

01:36:57.118 --> 01:37:00.485
- What do you want?
- To get my father's murderer.

01:37:00.889 --> 01:37:03.653
- What's your name?
- My name's Otto.

01:37:09.097 --> 01:37:11.065
What's the matter?

01:37:11.266 --> 01:37:15.225
- He's a worker.
- But he wants a gun.

01:37:15.971 --> 01:37:18.633
He won't last a week.

01:37:29.651 --> 01:37:34.486
A year later, no one
remembered how it had all begun.

01:37:34.689 --> 01:37:36.020
Take that!

01:37:38.827 --> 01:37:44.766
For both sides, the aim was to take
over the enemy's business in order...

01:37:44.966 --> 01:37:48.493
to buy more guns and take over
more businesses.

01:38:10.325 --> 01:38:13.522
I smoke, snort,
l've killed and robbed.

01:38:13.728 --> 01:38:16.060
I'm a man.

01:38:37.719 --> 01:38:42.747
The media started taking an interest.
The police had to intervene.

01:38:56.705 --> 01:39:01.108
A gang leader, from the City of God,
was arrested today.

01:39:01.309 --> 01:39:03.038
Manuel Machado,
a.k.a. Knockout Ned...

01:39:03.244 --> 01:39:06.645
was hospitalized after being
wounded by Li'l Z”s gang.

01:39:06.848 --> 01:39:09.078
Our reporter interviewed him.

01:39:09.284 --> 01:39:13.243
- Is the war still going on?
- It's still going on.

01:39:13.521 --> 01:39:18.049
- Have many people died?
- Many have died.

01:39:18.259 --> 01:39:20.386
Mostly innocent people.

01:39:20.595 --> 01:39:23.962
Just knowing me is enough...

01:39:24.165 --> 01:39:28.898
to get you killed by Li'l Z'.

01:39:29.104 --> 01:39:32.471
- The police don't go in there?
- They go after me, not him.

01:39:32.674 --> 01:39:39.011
I've been in jail, while he goes
on killing undisturbed.

01:39:39.214 --> 01:39:41.307
And they don't arrest him.

01:39:41.516 --> 01:39:43.814
Knockout Ned says
the war will continue.

01:39:44.018 --> 01:39:49.615
Police Chief Guedes has promised
to arrest both of the gangs.

01:39:58.099 --> 01:39:59.828
Motherfucker!

01:40:00.034 --> 01:40:03.595
I'm the boss here, but he gets
his picture in the paper!

01:40:03.805 --> 01:40:07.366
- Have you found mine?
- Just Knockout Ned's.

01:40:07.575 --> 01:40:09.042
Keep looking.

01:40:09.444 --> 01:40:12.174
At least my name's
got to be in there.

01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:14.075
- There's nothing.
- Can you read?

01:40:14.282 --> 01:40:16.716
Just the pictures.

01:40:17.685 --> 01:40:19.744
Nothing.

01:40:19.954 --> 01:40:23.048
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

01:40:23.258 --> 01:40:28.389
- It's just the want ads.
- I don't care, read everything!

01:40:28.596 --> 01:40:32.760
- But there aren't any articles.
- Want a bullet in your head?

01:40:34.769 --> 01:40:38.261
Gotta show them who's boss here.

01:40:43.311 --> 01:40:47.008
- Give me the camera!
- No way!

01:40:49.551 --> 01:40:51.883
Take my picture, man.

01:40:52.487 --> 01:40:55.217
I can't work it.

01:40:55.423 --> 01:40:57.118
Go ahead.

01:40:57.492 --> 01:41:02.054
- I'll hold the Beretta.
- Let me try...

01:41:02.697 --> 01:41:05.393
Back off...

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:09.866
- There's no click.
- What a bunch of bozos!

01:41:10.371 --> 01:41:13.135
I'm fucked with you guys.

01:41:15.210 --> 01:41:17.770
I have an idea.

01:41:17.979 --> 01:41:22.507
I'll go get a guy I know.
Hang loose.

01:41:23.384 --> 01:41:27.286
- Here he is.
- Take the camera.

01:41:27.989 --> 01:41:30.423
Well, kid?

01:41:31.492 --> 01:41:36.896
Aren't you a photographer?
Make the camerawork. We can't do it.

01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:40.497
Take our picture.

01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:49.240
- You fucking broke it.
- It wasn't me.

01:41:49.811 --> 01:41:51.506
I found it.

01:41:53.348 --> 01:41:55.509
It has to be wound.

01:41:59.954 --> 01:42:02.946
- What's your name?
- Rocket.

01:42:03.324 --> 01:42:07.260
- Another picture, Rocket.
- How about two rows?

01:42:07.462 --> 01:42:12.365
- What?
- Two rows. Everyone with their guns.

01:42:13.134 --> 01:42:17.161
- You're outside, for Christ's sake!
- Talk to him nicely, kid.

01:42:17.372 --> 01:42:19.306
Sorry. Move in, please.

01:42:21.809 --> 01:42:24.277
Another one.

01:42:28.650 --> 01:42:30.948
- I think the roll's finished.
- Then show us the pictures.

01:42:31.152 --> 01:42:34.019
- They have to be developed.
- Developed?

01:42:35.256 --> 01:42:36.917
How much is it?

01:42:37.525 --> 01:42:41.928
Take this money.
And bring back the pictures.

01:42:42.130 --> 01:42:47.397
- I have to remove the film.
- Keep the camera.

01:42:47.902 --> 01:42:52.305
Benny wanted to give it to you,
didn't he? So, it's yours...

01:42:52.507 --> 01:42:54.338
Thanks.

01:42:56.277 --> 01:43:00.475
Don't forget the pictures.
The photos, Rocket!

01:43:11.559 --> 01:43:13.891
- Pierre!
- What?

01:43:14.295 --> 01:43:17.662
Can you develop this for me?

01:43:18.366 --> 01:43:21.824
I can't, Rocket.
I could get into trouble.

01:43:22.036 --> 01:43:24.766
It's only for the paper's reporters.
I could risk my job.

01:43:24.973 --> 01:43:26.463
- Pierre?
- Yes, Rogerio?

01:43:26.674 --> 01:43:31.304
Develop these for me.
This one too, okay?

01:43:31.713 --> 01:43:34.079
I'm going to lunch.

01:43:34.282 --> 01:43:38.378
You're lucky. What size?

01:43:38.586 --> 01:43:41.987
- What?
- For the enlargement, what size?

01:43:42.457 --> 01:43:46.257
Well... Whatever you think is best.

01:44:06.047 --> 01:44:08.174
- Here.
- Thanks.

01:44:12.053 --> 01:44:14.715
I'm in deep shit now.

01:44:16.624 --> 01:44:19.149
I'm as good as dead.

01:44:30.405 --> 01:44:32.498
Someone had signed
my death sentence.

01:44:32.707 --> 01:44:36.165
I wanted to bash the jerk's face in.

01:44:41.849 --> 01:44:45.478
Are you Marina?
Because of you l'm dead.

01:44:45.686 --> 01:44:47.813
You stole my photos.

01:44:48.022 --> 01:44:51.890
Dead? Stole? What do you mean?
Not so loud.

01:44:53.194 --> 01:44:55.719
Not so loud?
I'll be killed because of you.

01:44:55.930 --> 01:44:58.490
You were gone,
your photos were in the lab.

01:44:58.699 --> 01:45:01.532
There's nothing I can do.
The photos in our lab...

01:45:01.736 --> 01:45:04.534
are photos to be published
in the paper.

01:45:04.739 --> 01:45:08.004
I saw the photos,
I published them.

01:45:08.209 --> 01:45:10.609
- You stole them.
- I did not. Here they are.

01:45:10.812 --> 01:45:15.181
- Give them to me.
- Just a second.

01:45:15.383 --> 01:45:18.511
Here are your photos.

01:45:18.719 --> 01:45:22.485
- Are there any others?
- Calm down. What's your name?

01:45:22.924 --> 01:45:25.984
- Rocket.
- Rocket?

01:45:26.694 --> 01:45:29.094
Nice to meet you.
I'm Marina.

01:45:29.297 --> 01:45:34.792
Now, relax. I have money for you.
For your pictures.

01:45:35.203 --> 01:45:40.231
Here, when we use a picture
we pay the photographer.

01:45:40.441 --> 01:45:43.467
- Do you want to be a photographer?
- Yes.

01:45:43.678 --> 01:45:47.546
- Great start! On the front page.
- How'd you get these photos?

01:45:47.748 --> 01:45:49.306
- I live there.
- Rocket...

01:45:49.851 --> 01:45:53.753
no photographer has ever been able
to go in there.

01:45:55.223 --> 01:45:59.853
If you could bring us
more pictures of Li'l Z'...

01:46:00.061 --> 01:46:05.089
the paper would buy them.
We'd pay you.

01:46:05.299 --> 01:46:07.358
Could you?

01:46:07.568 --> 01:46:09.433
I don't know.

01:46:09.737 --> 01:46:11.102
What's the problem?

01:46:11.305 --> 01:46:14.138
The problem? I can't go there
anymore at night.

01:46:14.342 --> 01:46:18.608
- And during the day?
- It's too risky.

01:46:20.214 --> 01:46:25.743
Look, man! They've finally
understood that l'm the boss.

01:46:27.388 --> 01:46:29.185
What's your
photographer-friend's name?

01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:30.618
Rocket.

01:46:30.825 --> 01:46:34.022
He's good. I'll take more
to show the others.

01:46:37.198 --> 01:46:40.463
So, Rocket, is it yes or no?

01:46:42.737 --> 01:46:45.706
It's a great opportunity.

01:46:47.642 --> 01:46:49.041
Okay.

01:46:50.278 --> 01:46:54.874
- You made the right choice. Very good!
- I'll give you some film, lenses...

01:46:55.082 --> 01:47:00.782
and even another camera.
I'll show you the equipment room.

01:47:00.988 --> 01:47:04.253
There's another problem.

01:47:04.458 --> 01:47:07.484
- What is it?
- Where can I sleep tonight?

01:47:08.262 --> 01:47:10.924
I can't go back now.

01:47:13.768 --> 01:47:18.262
This is a 135 mm.
Will you be close up or far away?

01:47:18.472 --> 01:47:19.461
Far away.

01:47:19.941 --> 01:47:22.466
- Can you measure the light?
- Yes.

01:47:24.579 --> 01:47:27.377
Aren't you too close?

01:47:29.550 --> 01:47:33.418
I don't know what spurred me
to go talk to them like that.

01:47:33.621 --> 01:47:35.816
Maybe I was going to die...

01:47:36.023 --> 01:47:39.424
but now I had a camera...

01:47:39.627 --> 01:47:42.323
and a chance to become
a photographer.

01:47:42.897 --> 01:47:45.297
Watch out for the dog shit.

01:47:45.733 --> 01:47:48.964
Not to mention that
the night was still young...

01:47:49.170 --> 01:47:52.537
- Want something to eat?
- No thank you, ma'am.

01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:58.440
Nothing to eat? Nothing to drink?
A joint?

01:47:59.714 --> 01:48:01.477
Try this...

01:48:20.268 --> 01:48:22.395
It's time to go to sleep.

01:48:24.438 --> 01:48:27.771
I'll show you your bed.

01:48:27.975 --> 01:48:31.001
- You have hot water, don't you?
- Yes.

01:48:31.212 --> 01:48:33.703
You've never taken a hot shower?

01:48:33.914 --> 01:48:36.144
- No.
- What do you do?

01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:39.581
We heat up the kettle.

01:48:39.787 --> 01:48:43.655
- Why are you standing there?
- What room do I sleep in?

01:48:43.858 --> 01:48:49.990
Unfortunately, there's only one room.
You have to sleep with me.

01:48:50.197 --> 01:48:53.860
I won't go into the details
of my first sexual experience.

01:48:54.068 --> 01:48:57.162
Just relax...

01:48:57.772 --> 01:48:59.672
Because, elsewhere...

01:48:59.874 --> 01:49:04.538
another more important sex scene
for the ghetto was taking place.

01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:08.278
Carrot was helping
Knockout Ned escape...

01:49:08.482 --> 01:49:11.110
without firing a shot.

01:49:12.553 --> 01:49:18.549
The policeman guarding him was
in the willing hands of the nurse.

01:49:19.226 --> 01:49:20.318
And in the meantime...

01:49:20.528 --> 01:49:23.929
to eliminate Carrot, Li'l Z'
was investing in munitions.

01:49:24.131 --> 01:49:26.861
He invested heavily,
even if he couldn't pay...

01:49:28.167 --> 01:49:31.568
- Remember the double-barrel?
- I already have it.

01:49:31.771 --> 01:49:36.538
This is a repeater rifle. You don't have
this one, the Browning.

01:49:36.776 --> 01:49:39.836
- It'll shoot down a plane.
- I'm not shooting down planes.

01:49:40.046 --> 01:49:43.345
And the one I asked for?
The AR-15, Uncle Sam.

01:49:44.116 --> 01:49:46.983
You can't get them in Brazil.

01:49:47.186 --> 01:49:49.177
My ass, Uncle Sam.

01:49:52.124 --> 01:49:54.354
I have a solution.

01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:56.255
The Rugger. Ever seen one?

01:49:56.462 --> 01:50:00.990
It's like the AR-15.
Same caliber, but lighter.

01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:04.601
With an infrared sight?
400 shots a minute?

01:50:04.804 --> 01:50:07.637
- It depends.
- It depends, my ass!

01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:10.400
Trying to fuck me over?

01:50:10.743 --> 01:50:12.608
I'll fuck you over first.

01:50:12.812 --> 01:50:15.713
You leave now without the money
or the guns.

01:50:16.782 --> 01:50:19.444
- What do I tell the boss?
- That's your problem.

01:50:19.652 --> 01:50:23.816
- You'll think of something.
- You heard him, chubby? Get out.

01:50:24.290 --> 01:50:27.555
Beat it, fatso.

01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:29.318
Li'l Z' had made a big mistake.

01:50:29.529 --> 01:50:33.829
He should have known that behind
every salesman lies a supplier.

01:50:34.033 --> 01:50:36.263
And they don't joke around.

01:50:37.770 --> 01:50:40.330
Have you seen this?

01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:43.106
What do they need an AR-15 for?

01:50:43.309 --> 01:50:46.278
These stories will push
the police to investigate.

01:50:46.479 --> 01:50:48.743
They'll nab you.
And me, along with you.

01:50:48.948 --> 01:50:53.578
Think l'm going
to give you away?

01:50:56.756 --> 01:50:59.350
Don't worry,
l'll take care of it.

01:50:59.559 --> 01:51:01.720
But don't fuck up again.

01:51:08.501 --> 01:51:10.662
Charlie!

01:51:11.370 --> 01:51:13.270
Come here!

01:51:13.472 --> 01:51:15.030
Listen...

01:51:15.241 --> 01:51:17.937
you tell him...

01:51:18.711 --> 01:51:22.841
Let's go make that sleazy
little dealer pay up.

01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:36.588
Come here, kids!

01:51:38.664 --> 01:51:42.191
- Do you like chicken?
- It depends.

01:51:42.401 --> 01:51:45.802
We'll eat some chicken
and have Carrot for dessert.

01:51:46.005 --> 01:51:49.338
I have a present for you.

01:51:51.410 --> 01:51:53.105
Here...

01:51:54.947 --> 01:51:56.938
A big one for you.

01:51:57.149 --> 01:51:59.174
Are you really giving us
these guns?

01:51:59.385 --> 01:52:04.118
Yes, but I want you on my side,
against Carrot.

01:52:04.323 --> 01:52:07.053
Then can we hold up
anyone we want?

01:52:07.259 --> 01:52:09.955
Not in the ghetto.
Can you shoot?

01:52:10.162 --> 01:52:11.959
- More or less.
- More or less?

01:52:12.164 --> 01:52:17.625
Hey, you guys, come help
these kids.

01:52:19.138 --> 01:52:21.129
I know. You do it like this.

01:52:27.279 --> 01:52:29.679
THE BEGINNING OF THE END

01:52:38.391 --> 01:52:39.380
Get that chicken!

01:52:52.672 --> 01:52:53.866
C'mon, let's go.

01:52:54.073 --> 01:52:56.007
If Li'l Z' catches you,
he'll kill you.

01:52:58.010 --> 01:53:00.877
Yeah, well, he's gotta
find me first.

01:53:08.754 --> 01:53:12.019
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:16.150
Shit! The cops!

01:53:16.362 --> 01:53:18.421
Hell, don't fucking run off!

01:53:18.631 --> 01:53:20.496
Give me that.

01:53:31.744 --> 01:53:34.110
Hey, Melonhead! You fucking fag!

01:53:34.313 --> 01:53:37.441
Get the hell out of here!

01:53:37.650 --> 01:53:39.015
Coward!

01:53:39.218 --> 01:53:41.243
Asshole!

01:53:42.188 --> 01:53:45.123
Come on, let them kill each other.

01:53:45.324 --> 01:53:48.054
They can fuck themselves.

01:53:56.202 --> 01:53:58.693
Rocket! Take a picture of us!

01:54:00.106 --> 01:54:02.404
What are you waiting for?

01:54:23.996 --> 01:54:25.759
What's happening?

01:54:26.132 --> 01:54:27.531
Shit!

01:54:40.613 --> 01:54:42.513
Let's go!

01:55:14.547 --> 01:55:17.209
Run! Run!

01:55:17.416 --> 01:55:20.283
Watch out!

01:55:20.486 --> 01:55:23.478
Kill one of these faggots!
Blast him!

01:55:43.142 --> 01:55:45.576
Knockout Ned!

01:55:59.358 --> 01:56:02.156
Take it easy. Don't move.

01:56:02.361 --> 01:56:04.090
It hurts, man.

01:56:04.296 --> 01:56:06.856
Easy does it, kid.

01:56:07.867 --> 01:56:10.529
Why did you join this fucking war?

01:56:10.736 --> 01:56:13.466
Knockout Ned!
Li'l Z' has been hit. Come on!

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.832
Wait here, l'll help you.
Just hold on.

01:56:27.052 --> 01:56:31.352
- What's your name?
- My name's Otto.

01:56:38.397 --> 01:56:41.389
I want to get my father's murderer.

01:57:05.991 --> 01:57:08.459
Knockout Ned! Li'l Z' has been hit.
Come on!

01:57:09.828 --> 01:57:14.162
I'll help you.
Just hold on there.

01:57:53.305 --> 01:57:56.638
The fucking cops!

01:57:56.842 --> 01:57:58.275
On the ground!

01:57:58.477 --> 01:58:00.377
- Hands over your head.
- Don't move!

01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:14.923
- You're the one I want.
- You're finished, pal.

01:58:15.127 --> 01:58:17.186
Handcuff him.

01:58:34.179 --> 01:58:35.737
Rocket, where are you going?

01:58:35.948 --> 01:58:38.416
I got something to clear up.

01:59:09.815 --> 01:59:11.339
Okay, lovebirds?

01:59:11.550 --> 01:59:15.247
Come on, Li'l Z',
let's go settle our scores.

01:59:16.088 --> 01:59:20.184
Not you. You're a present
for the media.

01:59:56.295 --> 01:59:57.728
Does it come to 10,000?

01:59:57.930 --> 02:00:00.990
Almost. That's all I have.

02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:04.567
- That's all there was, Chief.
- We searched everywhere.

02:00:04.770 --> 02:00:07.261
Let him go.

02:00:11.677 --> 02:00:14.578
What about this ring?
Is it gold?

02:00:14.780 --> 02:00:20.685
Fill it up. You'll owe us
the rest.

02:00:24.456 --> 02:00:26.686
Fucking war!

02:00:28.927 --> 02:00:31.487
Knockout Ned is dead
and I'm dead broke!

02:00:31.697 --> 02:00:33.961
You're fucked, eh?

02:00:34.166 --> 02:00:35.428
Kids...

02:00:35.634 --> 02:00:39.536
we'll have to do a few hold-ups
to get my business going again.

02:00:39.738 --> 02:00:42.673
- Your business, Li'l Z'?
- What's your problem, kid?

02:00:42.875 --> 02:00:45.537
This is for our friend,
motherfucker!

02:00:45.744 --> 02:00:47.268
A Soviet attack!

02:00:54.586 --> 02:00:57.521
The business is ours!

02:01:51.310 --> 02:01:55.610
This picture of the hood
will get me the job.

02:01:57.950 --> 02:01:59.815
This one will make me famous.

02:02:00.018 --> 02:02:02.782
It'll even make the cover
of a magazine.

02:02:05.090 --> 02:02:08.685
I won't have to worry
about Li'l Z' anymore.

02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:13.325
But the cops?

02:02:20.672 --> 02:02:25.109
GANGSTER, SELF-STYLED "BOSS"
OF THE CITY OF GOD, SHOT DEAD

02:02:27.546 --> 02:02:32.142
This photo could've gotten
us killed?

02:02:32.351 --> 02:02:33.909
I think so.

02:02:34.119 --> 02:02:36.815
At least it got you a job.

02:02:37.022 --> 02:02:40.856
- Not a job, an internship.
- It pays a little, doesn't it?

02:02:41.059 --> 02:02:43.493
A little.

02:02:43.762 --> 02:02:46.731
What about that lady journalist?
Was she a good lay?

02:02:46.932 --> 02:02:49.298
- More or less.
- You didn't like it?

02:02:49.501 --> 02:02:51.935
I don't think journalists know how
to screw.

02:02:52.137 --> 02:02:53.126
Yeah, I guess so.

02:02:53.338 --> 02:02:55.704
Cocoa robbed 3 houses in Barra.

02:02:55.907 --> 02:02:57.499
Better kill him.

02:02:57.709 --> 02:02:59.370
Who shot Roger?

02:02:59.578 --> 02:03:01.910
- It was Beef.
- Kill that fucker.

02:03:02.114 --> 02:03:04.480
We should kill the Chief
and Gringo as well.

02:03:04.683 --> 02:03:08.175
- What about Cherry?
- Let's go. Us two, and 3 others...

02:03:08.387 --> 02:03:10.252
It's a deal.

02:03:10.455 --> 02:03:13.049
Have you heard
of the Red Brigade?

02:03:13.258 --> 02:03:16.557
No, but if they come,
we'll kill them.

02:03:16.928 --> 02:03:21.194
- Who knows how to write?
- Me, sort of.

02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:24.433
Let's make a black list.
We'll kill them all.

02:03:24.636 --> 02:03:28.197
- Put fucking Nightowl on there.
- And Croquet.

02:03:28.407 --> 02:03:29.931
Leonard, too, he owes me money.

02:03:30.142 --> 02:03:32.076
And China-Man,
he thinks he's hot stuff.

02:03:32.277 --> 02:03:35.269
- And Claudio.
- Where's Giant?

02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:38.210
Come on, Giant!

02:03:52.664 --> 02:03:56.327
I forgot to say,
my name isn't Rocket anymore.

02:03:56.535 --> 02:03:58.765
BASED ON A REAL STORY
l'm now Wilson Rodrigues...

02:03:58.970 --> 02:04:00.665
photographer.

02:04:21.693 --> 02:04:23.490
Manuel Machado,
a.k.a. Knockout Ned...

02:04:23.695 --> 02:04:26.789
was hospitalized after
being wounded by Li'l Z”s gang.

02:04:26.998 --> 02:04:29.990
On leaving the hospital,
our reporter interviewed him.

02:04:30.202 --> 02:04:33.262
Many have died.
Mostly innocent people.

02:04:33.472 --> 02:04:37.101
Just knowing me is enough...

02:04:37.309 --> 02:04:41.143
just being my friend...

02:04:41.346 --> 02:04:45.282
If he thinks someone knows me,
he'll kill them.

02:04:45.484 --> 02:04:47.384
The police don't go in there?

02:04:47.586 --> 02:04:52.956
They go after me, not him.

02:04:53.158 --> 02:04:58.221
I've been in jail 3 times,
while he goes on...

02:04:58.430 --> 02:05:00.921
killing undisturbed.

02:05:01.133 --> 02:05:03.795
And they don't arrest him.

02:05:04.202 --> 02:05:06.727
Knockout Ned says
the war will continue.

02:05:06.938 --> 02:05:11.807
Police Chief Guedes has promised to
arrest both gangs in the City of God.
