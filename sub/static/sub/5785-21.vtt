I ﬁght crime
and ﬁnd other meta-humans like me.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.428
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

00:18.644 --> 00:22.102

I opened up our world to new threats.

this is as good an idea as any.

03:05.436 --> 03:06.596
Actually. I beg to differ.

03:06.771 --> 03:09.934
I think a better idea, instead of playing
hoodlums and holograms.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.268
would be to rebuild
the particle accelerator

that's what you keep saying.

03:15.321 --> 03:16.310

Look at what that explosion did
to this city.

Not to mention. the last time
we tried something like that,

03:21.035 --> 03:24.573
we blew a hole in the universe and
created, like, 50 portals to your Earth.

03:24.747 --> 03:27.534
Which is exactly how Zoom and
his henchmen got here in the ﬁrst place.

03:27.708 --> 03:31.041

I know how to contain the explosion.

You tried this on your Earth, remember?
Didn't go so well.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.258
And even if you could contain it,

03:44.433 --> 03:47.015
I thought you said that Bany couldn't
tap into the Speed Force anymore.

03:47.186 --> 03:48.767

the ﬁrst time he got his powers.

with the dark matter from
the particle accelerator explosion.

03:59.990 --> 04:03.824
I can recreate the circumstances to
get you your speed back.

it's not gonna save Snow.

By recreating

-Uh...

12:45.223 --> 12:47.054
No. I'm good. Thanks.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.350
So, what's wrong?

12:51.563 --> 12:54.305
What, something has to be wrong for me
to want to catch up with my brother?

12:54.483 --> 12:56.690
(CH UCKLES) Yeah, that's usually the way
it works with you, isn't it?

12:57.235 --> 13:00.523
Actually. I had this feeling

13:00.697 --> 13:02.688
that I should come and see you.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.402
And make sure you're okay. so...

13:04.743 --> 13:07.951
Don't tell me I'm gonna be kidnapped by
Snart and his pyromaniac friend again?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.203
Us. You, me. us.
They kidnapped both of us.

13:10.499 --> 13:13.081
Yeah, well, you're not the one
who almost had his hands frozen off.

13:14.169 --> 13:16.080
Lucky I can still play the piano.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.082
Although my octaves haven't
quite been the same,

13:18.256 --> 13:19.712
but not that that matters to you.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.794
Dante, I called you. More than once.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.459
But of course. you didn't answer.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.794
Like I said, only when something's wrong.

13:26.264 --> 13:27.424
(SCOFFS) Yeah. Okay.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.396
I don't know why I thought
that whole experience,

13:33.563 --> 13:37.397
that was it,
that was gonna bring us closer.

13:37.943 --> 13:40.059
Cisco, we haven't been close
since we were kids.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.524
I don't think anything's
ever going to change that.

13:49.705 --> 13:52.242
All right.
We'll bring down some more supplies later.

13:52.666 --> 13:53.746
How you can reach us.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.328
And exactly how long
are we supposed to be in here?

This is the safest place
for the two of you right now.

-What are you going to do?
-Whatever we can.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.629
Joe, let me do something.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.799

you can do right now.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.174

14:13.353 --> 14:16.595

14:28.869 --> 14:29.949
(SIGHS) Thank you.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.993
So this is what it takes to
get Bany his speed back.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.332
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. Yeah.

14:38.962 --> 14:41.248
It's not uncomplicated, but almost there.

14:41.423 --> 14:42.458
I told you before.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.248
Once Bany makes up his mind,
it's impossible to change it.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.419
Well, then we need to convince him that
this is the only way

14:48.597 --> 14:50.212
before he decides not to do it, right?

14:50.807 --> 14:53.970
You shouldn't have to convince anyone to
do anything against his will.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.141
Joe, we're talking about Bany, right?

14:58.315 --> 15:01.728
I mean, I can't... I can't imagine
you don't feel the same way.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.773
Henry, right now, I don't know
what the right thing to do is.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.320
Seems clear to me.

15:07.532 --> 15:10.820
This isn't just about your son, Henry.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.490
This is about the people in Central City,
about saving those people.

15:13.663 --> 15:14.823
This is about stopping Zoom.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.118
Your daughter is safe.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.824
This could kill my son.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.411
I'm not gonna let that happen.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.957
The last time he was struck by lightning,
he was in a coma for nine months.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.999
-How did that happen?
-I know what I'm doing.

15:28.178 --> 15:31.090
You are messing with something
that is out of your control.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.215
And what if it did work?
I mean, what then?

15:34.392 --> 15:36.223
Joe, he's goes up against Zoom?

15:36.478 --> 15:40.062
(STUTTERS) The monster that snapped
his back and almost killed him?

15:40.232 --> 15:41.972
And then took the one thing

15:42.150 --> 15:44.857
that he's convinced now that
he needs in order to make him whole?

15:45.028 --> 15:48.566
This is the way. This is the only way.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.447

26:03.020 --> 26:04.271
You weren't supposed to read that.

26:04.522 --> 26:06.478
It was on your desk.
It was addressed to Mom and me.

26:06.649 --> 26:08.310
So, yeah, I read it.

26:08.860 --> 26:11.067
Look, I gotta go. okay?
We'll talk about this later.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.977
No, man.
We're gonna talk about this right now.

26:13.156 --> 26:14.362
Okayl Let's talk about this now.

26:14.532 --> 26:15.647
What did you want me to say?

26:15.992 --> 26:17.152
"What up, fam?

26:17.368 --> 26:20.451
"I know you probably don't care, but I'm
going off to another Earth for a hot sec.

26:20.705 --> 26:21.865
"If I don't make it
back in time for dinner,

26:22.039 --> 26:23.415
"it probably didn't go so well."

26:24.000 --> 26:25.661
Why did you even go in the ﬁrst place?

26:25.835 --> 26:28.201
Because my friends needed my help.

26:28.463 --> 26:29.748
What kind of help?

26:30.590 --> 26:32.831
-They needed me to vibe.
-V|be?

26:34.719 --> 26:37.131
That's what that lunatic called you
who attacked us.

26:37.513 --> 26:38.969
What aren't you telling me, Cisco?

26:46.606 --> 26:47.846
I have powers.

26:50.359 --> 26:51.394
m1

26:54.655 --> 26:56.520
What, you're like a meta-human?

27:04.373 --> 27:07.536
I was affected when the accelerator
went off two years ago.

27:07.794 --> 27:12.333
And now I see things, vibes. of people.

27:12.924 --> 27:14.039
Like, visions?

27:16.219 --> 27:17.459
So that's why you called me.

27:18.262 --> 27:19.342
man

27:20.181 --> 27:21.216
I had one of you.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.009
At least I thought it was you,

27:23.309 --> 27:25.766
until your World of Warcraﬁ'
doppelganger showed up.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.355
-You killed his brother?
-No.

27:28.606 --> 27:30.562
I didn't kill his brother. Of course not.

27:30.733 --> 27:32.234
Why wouldn't you tell me any of this?

27:32.401 --> 27:35.438
Because you're right.
It's just like you said.

27:36.239 --> 27:38.230
We haven't been close in years and...

27:40.243 --> 27:41.983
And there's nothing
we can do to change that.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.414
Look, I gotta go.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.547
Just wait for me here, okay?

28:05.726 --> 28:06.806
You all set, Cisco?

28:07.311 --> 28:08.426
Yeah, we're set.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.057
i:EH1i:luri11i:g.

28:26.289 --> 28:28.951
Now where has everybody gone?

28:34.547 --> 28:38.540
Flash. Not who I was expecting.
but you'll be a nice warm-up.

28:41.512 --> 28:42.797
Too slow. Rupture.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.016
Come on, Flash!

28:53.566 --> 28:55.773
-All right, time to win an Oscar.
-Let's do it.

29:14.837 --> 29:17.328
-Get up.
-Are we the guys you were looking for?

29:17.924 --> 29:19.039
Hope you like being alone,

29:19.216 --> 29:21.047
'cause you won't be talking to anyone
in Iron Heights.

29:24.597 --> 29:25.882
Cisco, we got him. All good.

29:26.057 --> 29:27.922
-Okay. we're Iivel Sir...
-Get back. Get that camera back.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.180
L - 0A-

29:29.352 --> 29:31.468
Breaking news coming out of
Jitters coffee shop.

29:33.731 --> 29:36.848
was just apprehended
after an altercation with The Flash.

29:37.026 --> 29:39.017
-That's right...
-You told them Rupture was coming.

29:39.528 --> 29:40.608
um

29:41.364 --> 29:42.353
mm

29:47.203 --> 29:49.660
You are smart, aren't you?

29:51.040 --> 29:52.120
You betrayed mel

29:52.375 --> 29:53.831
You said you would spare them.

29:55.670 --> 29:59.458
-I guess now we're even.
-Jay, nol

30:01.884 --> 30:04.591
My name is Zoom.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.549
Oh, my God.

30:14.188 --> 30:15.268
151i

30:21.737 --> 30:23.568
Make sure you get this.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.272
-What the—
-They gotta get out of there.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.200
Everybody movel

30:44.593 --> 30:45.582
Bany, don'tl

30:46.512 --> 30:47.592
VIM

30:47.763 --> 30:51.927
I told you what would happen
if you disobeyed me.

30:52.309 --> 30:54.140
Hey, stopl Stopl

30:54.311 --> 30:56.927
God... You've made your point.

30:57.231 --> 30:59.643
Not quite yet.

31:04.321 --> 31:08.439
You're an even bigger disappointment
than your brother.

31:18.252 --> 31:22.291
Central City, The Flash you've seen

31:22.465 --> 31:25.002
in your streets is a fake.

31:25.301 --> 31:28.919
A hologram meant to give you hope.

31:29.305 --> 31:32.092
But there is no more hope,

31:32.266 --> 31:34.678
there is no more Flash,

31:34.977 --> 31:41.143
and there's no one left
to protect your city from me.

31:45.029 --> 31:47.645
Tell the rest of your force, Captain,

31:47.823 --> 31:51.281
that their policing days are over.

31:54.288 --> 31:57.496
You're only alive because of Caitlin.

31:58.501 --> 32:01.368
Try something like this again,

32:01.545 --> 32:03.877
and my affection for her

32:04.048 --> 32:06.755
won't stop me from killing you,

32:08.636 --> 32:10.592
or the rest of this city.

32:27.863 --> 32:29.239
Did you see this?

32:31.575 --> 32:33.531
That's what you left to go do, wasn't it?

32:35.246 --> 32:39.364
Look, man, I know you're mad at me,
and we haven't been close in a long time.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.210
I want things to change.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.375
You're my brother.

32:55.558 --> 32:56.764
Okay.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.560
Okay.

33:10.239 --> 33:12.651
You know that wall's not just going to
open for you, right?

33:13.242 --> 33:14.402
It might.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.028
Yeah. Trust me. It won't.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.737
wmmsmmm

33:20.583 --> 33:21.823
We should be out there, with them.

33:22.251 --> 33:24.583
Why? So Zoom can take us again?

33:25.004 --> 33:26.369
No. So we can help stop him.

33:26.589 --> 33:29.501
What are we gonna do?
I mean, we don't have any powers.

33:29.925 --> 33:30.960
I don't know.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.422
But you're pretty quick at
solving "unsolvable problems."

33:36.307 --> 33:37.717
Let's ﬁgure it out.

33:40.186 --> 33:41.426
I will see what I can do.

33:43.022 --> 33:44.262
It won't be long now.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.271
He's moving faster
than he ever did on my Earth.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.934
Next, he'll recruit
every meta-human he can ﬁnd,

33:52.114 --> 33:54.150
How many could be left?
We defeated most of them, didn't we?

33:54.783 --> 33:56.523
No. You're not even close.

33:57.620 --> 34:02.330
This is the list of meta-humans
from my Earth.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.122
Ones that are the known, anyway.

34:04.501 --> 34:07.243
Particle accelerator explosion
was contained on my Earth.

34:07.838 --> 34:09.248
That didn't happen here.

34:09.632 --> 34:12.123
Then why wouldn't we know
about other meta-humans here?

34:12.551 --> 34:13.961
JWIIETJEEEEI

34:14.303 --> 34:16.134
And now that everyone knows
that he's not around—

34:16.305 --> 34:17.886
They'll start coming out of the woodwork.

34:18.057 --> 34:19.092
VIII: mu m m

34:19.558 --> 34:20.889
What more do you need?

34:22.019 --> 34:24.101
I told you he'd recruit meta-humans,
we've seen him do that.

34:24.271 --> 34:26.762
I told you he would kill those ofﬁcers,
we saw him do that, too.

34:27.024 --> 34:28.434
What more do you need?

34:31.904 --> 34:32.984
Let's do it.

34:34.531 --> 34:35.657
I wanna do it.

34:41.956 --> 34:44.242
One of those cops that Zoom
killed tonight, he had a son.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.247
Same age I was when Mom was murdered.

34:46.418 --> 34:49.285
Now another kid has to grow up
without one of their parents

34:49.463 --> 34:53.832
because The Flash wasn't there
to stop that monster.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.757
I left this city unprotected
by giving up my powers to Zoom.

34:59.390 --> 35:01.631
mammmmmn

35:02.309 --> 35:03.549
I need my powers back.

35:06.814 --> 35:07.974
Let's do it.

35:08.357 --> 35:10.018
Let's set off the particle accelerator.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.737
So how does this work?

35:25.165 --> 35:28.328
It's an abbreviated version of
the accelerator evil Wells built,

35:28.502 --> 35:32.836
except Hany is isolating
the antimatter and dark energy

35:33.007 --> 35:35.089
to direct it to Bany
instead of the entire city.

35:35.426 --> 35:37.212
Good. Last thing we need is

35:37.386 --> 35:39.502
more meta-humans
running around Central City.

35:40.180 --> 35:45.470
So Bany just gets in,
you turn it on and that's it?

35:45.936 --> 35:48.052
Yeah. No.

35:48.897 --> 35:49.886
Not exactly.

35:50.065 --> 35:53.228
In addition to recreating what happened
with the particle accelerator explosion,

35:53.444 --> 35:55.400
we also have to recreate
what happened to Bany.

35:55.571 --> 35:56.686
Getting struck by lightning.

35:57.573 --> 35:58.562
That's right.

35:58.782 --> 36:01.239
Wait, so how are you going to do that?
It's not even raining outside.

36:01.410 --> 36:02.991
Well, Ramon, you have the wand?

36:03.454 --> 36:04.944
ummnmnmmmm:

36:05.122 --> 36:06.953
No, the one you built
for the Hany Potter convention.

36:07.124 --> 36:08.830
Yes, of course the one
you built for Mardon.

36:09.376 --> 36:10.991
How do you know about
that Hany Potter convention?

36:11.712 --> 36:14.078
Get the wand, get on the roof.

36:14.465 --> 36:16.581
-Why the roof?
-Because we're gonna need a lightning rod,

36:17.259 --> 36:19.591
and that, Ramon, is going to be you.

36:29.146 --> 36:30.602
All right, I'm on the roof.

36:32.608 --> 36:34.223
I've never actually been up here before.

36:35.110 --> 36:36.896
I think I can see my apartment from here.

36:37.279 --> 36:38.610
Now head straight to the satellite, Ramon.

36:38.781 --> 36:40.237
When I give you the signal,

36:40.407 --> 36:42.739
you're going to create
a lightning storm above you.

36:42.910 --> 36:45.242
So I'm just supposed to stand here
in the middle of a lightning storm?

36:45.412 --> 36:48.324
Really, Ramon, chances of being struck
are slim, indeed.

36:48.624 --> 36:50.160
Yeah, not when you're the one causing it!

36:50.334 --> 36:52.916
All we need is one lightning bolt
to strike the satellite.

36:53.087 --> 36:54.668
The satellite's circuitry's
connected to the breach room.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.999
Bany's in the breach room. Just do it.

36:57.174 --> 36:58.334
Yeah, I'm doing it.

36:58.926 --> 37:00.462
,l'li'luiill’Eilti :lEizalll'il i!

37:01.303 --> 37:03.760
Cisco Ramon's about to
conduct something nasty.

37:07.184 --> 37:10.347
You're gonna feel these clamps,
but they're necessary.

37:13.649 --> 37:14.764
You good?

37:15.150 --> 37:16.981
Yeah. Are you?

37:20.155 --> 37:21.315
I'll be ﬁne, Joe.

37:29.790 --> 37:31.326
Bany, whatever happens,

37:31.500 --> 37:34.162
it will never change the way
that I feel about you.

37:49.518 --> 37:54.888
Son, you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

37:57.901 --> 38:01.940
Being The Flash,
that's the best version of me.

38:03.323 --> 38:07.032
If I don't have my speed,
I'll never be that person anymore.

38:08.328 --> 38:09.659
I have to do this.

38:11.790 --> 38:12.950
Okay.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.168
You ready, Allen?

38:23.218 --> 38:25.960
All right then. Here we go.

38:35.230 --> 38:39.098
Think of it as hot-wiring a car.
Right, so there's a motor inside the wall.

38:39.276 --> 38:41.892
So all we have to do is
provide electricity to make it turn on.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.105
Exactly.

38:43.572 --> 38:45.904
So let me just do a little here...

38:49.828 --> 38:51.910
-Do you feel that?
-Yeah, what's happening?

38:53.499 --> 38:55.114
The particles are becoming unstable.

38:56.168 --> 38:57.157
Ramon, get ready.

38:57.544 --> 38:59.500
I'm gonna release the chemicals
into his system.

39:09.264 --> 39:10.595
Why are you doing this?

39:11.141 --> 39:14.633
The night Bany was struck by lightning,
he was doing ﬁngerprint analysis.

39:14.811 --> 39:18.429
Those chemicals got in his system then,
and they are going in now.

39:18.607 --> 39:19.938
So you're injecting them into him?

39:20.108 --> 39:22.815
We have to recreate everything
that happened to Bany that night.

39:22.986 --> 39:24.101
I'm okay, Iris.

39:25.781 --> 39:26.770
Hold on, Banyl

39:29.284 --> 39:31.491
-He's going hydrostatic.
-Almost there, almost there!

39:32.871 --> 39:33.860
-Wellsl
-Almost there!
