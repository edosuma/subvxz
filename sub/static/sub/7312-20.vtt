WEBVTT

00:03.391 --> 00:05.782
[crowd clamoring,
rock music blaring]

00:16.869 --> 00:18.521
Victory!

00:18.565 --> 00:19.956
I got to stop.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Great idea!

00:22.043 --> 00:23.956
[groans]
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did we get you?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.130
Gee, you think?

00:25.173 --> 00:27.086
Oh, here. Here you go.

00:27.130 --> 00:28.304
Hey!

00:28.347 --> 00:29.826
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:29.869 --> 00:31.565
Here, touch me--
you'll make it even.

00:33.391 --> 00:35.347
No, thank you.

00:35.391 --> 00:37.304
I... That didn't
come out right.

00:37.347 --> 00:39.217
[groans with disgust]

00:39.260 --> 00:40.652
WOMAN:
What a jerk!

00:40.695 --> 00:43.434
All right, all right!
Let go!
Man, sober up.

00:46.521 --> 00:47.956
Dude, you okay?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.608
I'll drop you off
back at base, man.

00:49.652 --> 00:50.913
No, no, no,
I'm just going to walk.

00:50.956 --> 00:51.826
Shake the stink off.

01:08.347 --> 01:11.086
CHILD-LIKE VOICE:
Play with me.

01:11.130 --> 01:13.826
Please... play with me.

01:16.956 --> 01:18.043
Play with me.

01:18.086 --> 01:20.478
Please...

01:20.521 --> 01:22.739
play with me.

01:24.652 --> 01:27.260
Play with me.

01:27.304 --> 01:30.739
Please... play with me.

01:33.086 --> 01:35.608
Play with me.

01:35.652 --> 01:38.130
Please... play with me.

02:10.869 --> 02:13.260
ZIVA [laughing]:
Yes, they came in this morning.

02:13.304 --> 02:14.869
In fact, I'm wearing them
right now.

02:14.913 --> 02:16.739
Oh, yes.

02:16.782 --> 02:19.000
They feel really,
really good when I move.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.086
[laughs]
I have to get to work.

02:22.130 --> 02:23.608
Yeah, I'm going to
have to call you back.

02:25.217 --> 02:27.608
Yeah, I, uh...

02:27.652 --> 02:29.521
I miss you too, Ray.

02:29.565 --> 02:32.043
Yeah.
[chuckles] Okay, bye.

02:32.086 --> 02:35.652
I do. And I do not care
who knows.

02:35.695 --> 02:37.260
Well, sounds like you're
getting pretty serious.

02:37.304 --> 02:39.000
I am happy. Ray is happy.

02:40.434 --> 02:42.391
We are meeting
in New York, next weekend.

02:42.434 --> 02:45.173
He's taking me to the opera.

02:45.217 --> 02:48.086
The opera? Wow.

02:48.130 --> 02:49.608
Does his boyfriend
know about you?

02:49.652 --> 02:50.826
[Ziva laughs]

02:50.869 --> 02:52.391
No, but his mom does.

02:52.434 --> 02:54.043
You've met the 'rents?

02:54.086 --> 02:55.347
When are we going
to get to meet him?

02:55.391 --> 02:57.000
All in good time,
McGee.

02:57.043 --> 03:01.826
And how is your...
special new someone?

03:01.869 --> 03:03.173
I don't have a special anything.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.565
And it's none of your business.

03:04.608 --> 03:06.826
Huh! Well, someone's
keeping secrets.

03:06.869 --> 03:09.434
That's pretty classic,

03:09.478 --> 03:11.130
coming from the woman
who's kept her...

03:11.173 --> 03:13.260
"boyfriend" hidden from us
for months.

03:13.304 --> 03:14.347
I'm not hiding anything.

03:14.391 --> 03:16.304
Ray knows all about you.

03:16.347 --> 03:18.217
Again, why haven't we met him?

03:18.260 --> 03:20.565
Because Ray knows all about you.

03:20.608 --> 03:22.826
I'm not the one you should be
worried about, right?

03:22.869 --> 03:26.130
I've seen men of steel
melt from a mere glance

03:26.173 --> 03:28.391
from Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

03:28.434 --> 03:30.260
That flinty, steel-eyed stare

03:30.304 --> 03:34.695
that makes those men turn into
sniveling little girls.

03:34.739 --> 03:36.173
[silly high-pitched voice]:
Ooh! It's just...

03:36.217 --> 03:36.869
Morning, boss.

03:39.086 --> 03:40.434
Grab your gear.

03:40.478 --> 03:41.956
Got a dead Naval officer
in Virginia.

03:54.956 --> 03:56.130
GIBBS:
Hey, Duck.

03:56.173 --> 03:57.913
Think we could get
a better look at this?

03:57.956 --> 04:00.217
DUCKY:
He's wrapped up tighter
than a Thanksgiving turkey.

04:00.260 --> 04:03.173
His ankles are bound.
That's odd.

04:03.217 --> 04:06.043
Well, we'll move
as fast as we can.

04:06.086 --> 04:07.652
TONY:
Might want to move
a little faster.

04:07.695 --> 04:09.608
Looks like the locals
want to get back to work.

04:09.652 --> 04:11.478
Well, they probably
didn't expect him

04:11.521 --> 04:13.521
to be part of their spring crop.

04:13.565 --> 04:17.173
Although human remains
would make a...

04:17.217 --> 04:18.130
excellent fertilizer.

04:18.173 --> 04:19.217
Oh, that is stinky.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.478
Ooh, yeah. Just a little.

04:20.521 --> 04:22.478
JIMMY:
Yeah, throat's cut.

04:22.521 --> 04:24.608
DUCKY:
And a deep cut at that.

04:24.652 --> 04:26.043
Had a pet gerbil
when I was a kid.

04:26.086 --> 04:27.521
I, uh, buried him

04:27.565 --> 04:30.434
in my mother's vegetable
garden after he died.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.652
And that year, her plum tomatoes
were better than ever.

04:32.695 --> 04:35.000
I used to think of him every
time I bit into one, and...

04:35.043 --> 04:37.956
'cause he-he was talking about
the, uh, fertilizer...

04:38.000 --> 04:40.695
so, uh... You're right.
I'm sorry, sorry.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.173
Skin is dehydrated.

04:42.217 --> 04:44.347
Decomposition has set in.

04:44.391 --> 04:46.782
How long ago?Uh, my guess--

04:46.826 --> 04:48.217
four to five days.

04:48.260 --> 04:50.347
He's extremely clean.

04:50.391 --> 04:53.695
There's no defensive wounds.

04:53.739 --> 04:55.347
No obvious signs of a struggle.

04:55.391 --> 04:56.478
No blood pooling.

04:56.521 --> 04:57.826
I'd say he was killed
somewhere else

04:57.869 --> 04:59.086
and left here.

04:59.130 --> 05:00.304
Gibbs, the farm's owner says

05:00.347 --> 05:01.913
he has only seen his employees

05:01.956 --> 05:03.521
around this area the past week.

05:03.565 --> 05:05.086
TONY: Hmm. That's about
half a mile from the road.

05:05.130 --> 05:06.652
No street lamps.

05:06.695 --> 05:08.913
Easy to come and go
without being seen.

05:08.956 --> 05:12.043
Police report someone found
a wallet and a watch

05:12.086 --> 05:13.260
in a Dumpster near town.

05:13.304 --> 05:15.043
No one claimed it.GIBBS:
You get an I.D.?

05:15.086 --> 05:17.869
Uh, it was empty except
for about 50 bucks.

05:17.913 --> 05:20.043
TONY: Whoever killed the
captain wasn't after his cash.

05:20.086 --> 05:22.826
[electronic trilling]

05:22.869 --> 05:24.130
Uh, this is not a captain.

05:26.173 --> 05:27.130
[beeping]

05:27.173 --> 05:29.043
Seaman Derek Balfour.

05:29.086 --> 05:31.913
Whoever killed him
could have played dress-up.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.782
Something is in his
lapel here, Doctor.

05:33.826 --> 05:35.782
DUCKY:
It's a Metro card.

05:35.826 --> 05:37.608
Based on the date stamp,

05:37.652 --> 05:40.173
purchased after
his time of death.

05:40.217 --> 05:43.391
Jethro, take a look at this.

05:43.434 --> 05:47.434
This young man's gaze has
been altered, postmortem.

05:47.478 --> 05:50.652
Yeah, someone physically
adjusted his eyeballs.

05:50.695 --> 05:53.304
Combine where they're
looking now,

05:53.347 --> 05:56.260
with the Metro
card and, uh...

05:56.304 --> 05:57.347
What is he looking toward?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.260
TONY:
D.C.

06:03.304 --> 06:05.173
It's a message.

06:14.217 --> 06:17.000
TONY:
Seaman Derek Balfour, 22.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.956
Enlisted three years ago,
stationed at Norfolk.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Scheduled to ship out
next week for a second tour

06:21.043 --> 06:23.000
to the Middle East.Service record?

06:23.043 --> 06:24.608
C.O. says he's likeable,
but a bit of a loose cannon.

06:24.652 --> 06:25.956
Not captain material, boss.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.173
He was dedicated,
though.

06:28.217 --> 06:31.391
"Seaman Balfour lacks the skills
necessary for promotion,

06:31.434 --> 06:32.956
"yet has great devotion
to the Navy.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.260
He works harder
than anyone else."

06:34.304 --> 06:35.478
And played even harder.

06:35.521 --> 06:36.913
Written up for
a drunk-and-disorderly,

06:36.956 --> 06:39.043
six months ago--
mandatory alcohol counseling.

06:39.086 --> 06:40.086
McGEE: Passed with
flying colors.

06:40.130 --> 06:41.956
Not a blemish on
his record since.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.565
Did he have a family?TONY:
Mom's in Rhode Island.

06:43.608 --> 06:45.347
They've been estranged
for years.

06:45.391 --> 06:46.869
Dad was never in
the picture. No siblings.

06:46.913 --> 06:48.869
Left home when he was 15;

06:48.913 --> 06:50.739
Thank you.supported himself
with odd jobs

06:50.782 --> 06:52.608
until he joined
the Navy.
A friend
of Seaman Balfour's says

06:52.652 --> 06:54.956
they were at a D.C. club
together last Thursday night.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.913
They had several beers,

06:57.956 --> 07:00.217
and left separately
around 1:00 a.m.

07:00.260 --> 07:03.043
Okay, phone records,
e-mails, financials.McGEE: On it.

07:09.173 --> 07:11.260
I thought you
were in Miami.
I lied.

07:11.304 --> 07:12.478
I was in the parking lot.

07:14.913 --> 07:18.043
ZIVA:
You have been very creepy today.

07:18.086 --> 07:19.521
"Sneaky."
[chuckles]

07:19.565 --> 07:20.652
And yes, I have.

07:20.695 --> 07:23.217
But for a very good cause.

07:23.260 --> 07:25.434
Introductions, Ziva?

07:25.478 --> 07:28.304
Um, uh, right.

07:28.347 --> 07:30.043
Of course.
Uh, Ray Cruz...

07:30.086 --> 07:33.043
this is everyone.

07:33.086 --> 07:36.391
Special Agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

07:36.434 --> 07:38.565
Pleasure, sir.

07:38.608 --> 07:39.565
Agent Timothy McGee.

07:39.608 --> 07:41.043
Hi.
RAY:
How are you?

07:41.086 --> 07:42.434
Tony DiNozzo.

07:42.478 --> 07:45.000
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
It's a pleasure.

07:45.043 --> 07:46.782
Special Agent.
Heard good things.

07:46.826 --> 07:48.956
Yeah. Likewise.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.956
Friend of Ziva's
is a friend of ours.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.434
Of course, the last time she
had an out-of-town visitor,

07:52.478 --> 07:53.565
our director ended up
in the hospital.

07:53.608 --> 07:55.739
[chuckles]
Well, I come in peace.

07:55.782 --> 07:57.086
Promise.

07:57.130 --> 07:58.695
And despite the injuries
your director sustained,

07:58.739 --> 08:00.913
the agency thinks that

08:00.956 --> 08:02.739
you navigated that
situation very well.

08:03.913 --> 08:05.565
You CIA?

08:05.608 --> 08:09.000
Just celebrated my
13th year, sir.TONY: That's funny.

08:09.043 --> 08:12.521
Ziva failed to mention
your line of work.

08:12.565 --> 08:14.695
Well, that's what I do.
It's-it's not who I am.

08:14.739 --> 08:16.869
That's a very Zen,
New-Agey kind of attitude

08:16.913 --> 08:18.782
for someone who installs
puppet regimes for a living.

08:18.826 --> 08:20.739
Okay. Uh, Gibbs,
can I give Ray a tour?

08:20.782 --> 08:23.782
Yeah, sure. Don't lose him.

08:25.086 --> 08:28.000
It's been a pleasure
meeting all of you.

08:34.130 --> 08:37.130
Huh. So it's not
"Renaissance Ray."

08:37.173 --> 08:38.521
It's "CIA Ray."

08:38.565 --> 08:40.347
He's "CI-Ray."

08:40.391 --> 08:41.695
You really should get that
checked out.

08:41.739 --> 08:43.043
It's like a bad tick
or something.

08:43.086 --> 08:45.739
There's something
about this guy, boss.

08:45.782 --> 08:47.782
His smile is disturbing.

08:47.826 --> 08:49.130
Haven't seen a smile like that

08:49.173 --> 08:51.130
since Christian Bale's
barely audible Batman

08:51.173 --> 08:52.739
in The Dark Knight.
DiNozzo.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.086
Right. Back to work.

08:57.782 --> 09:02.086
[imitating Christian Bale]:
"It's what I do, not who I am."

09:02.130 --> 09:04.086
What's...?

09:04.130 --> 09:06.347
It's just so weird.

09:06.391 --> 09:10.173
So many Naval decorations for
the "low man on the totem pole."

09:10.217 --> 09:12.347
Sorry. No offense.

09:12.391 --> 09:14.347
Actually, Mr. Palmer,
if Seaman Balfour

09:14.391 --> 09:16.478
had been "totemized,"
as it were,

09:16.521 --> 09:18.000
he would have been
much closer to the top.

09:18.043 --> 09:20.130
I don't follow.

09:20.173 --> 09:22.521
Native Americans designed
their poles so that

09:22.565 --> 09:25.956
the lower you were on it, the
higher they held you in esteem.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.086
Calling someone "low man
on the totem pole"

09:28.130 --> 09:29.652
is, in fact, a compliment.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.869
So all these years,

09:31.913 --> 09:34.086
Gibbs has been complimenting me.

09:34.130 --> 09:35.913
Oh, I wouldn't go
that far, Palmer.

09:35.956 --> 09:38.521
How far are you
getting, Duck?

09:38.565 --> 09:40.608
As far as the evidence
will allow-- not very.

09:40.652 --> 09:43.913
However, Seaman Balfour, here,

09:43.956 --> 09:47.260
died from loss of blood
from a severed carotid artery.

09:47.304 --> 09:49.869
A six-centimeter-deep cut.

09:49.913 --> 09:51.043
They knew
what they were doing.

09:51.086 --> 09:53.304
And they knew not to
leave anything behind.

09:53.347 --> 09:55.608
The body was thoroughly
cleansed.

09:55.652 --> 09:57.521
I mean, I've been
over it twice, Jethro.

09:57.565 --> 10:00.043
There's nothing--
no trace of blood,

10:00.086 --> 10:02.913
no fingerprints,
no strand of hair.

10:02.956 --> 10:04.608
Additionally...Oh, the fingernails

10:04.652 --> 10:05.913
on both hands
were just cut.

10:05.956 --> 10:07.913
DUCKY: Well, manicured
is more like it.

10:07.956 --> 10:09.956
And the skin is
abraded in places

10:10.000 --> 10:11.521
where the person
scrubbed so hard.

10:11.565 --> 10:13.130
Meticulous.

10:13.173 --> 10:15.913
Not to mention well-trained.

10:15.956 --> 10:20.695
Oh, we did find traces of a
rare, high-grade cleanser.

10:20.739 --> 10:22.217
Abby is running tests.

10:22.260 --> 10:25.217
Medical background?
Perhaps.

10:25.260 --> 10:29.043
But I wouldn't rule out someone
from law enforcement, either.

10:29.086 --> 10:31.913
Someone who knows the
value of a clean corpse.

10:31.956 --> 10:35.043
DUCKY:
Ah! Greetings, Director.

10:35.086 --> 10:37.782
What brings you to the nether
regions of our building?

10:37.826 --> 10:39.434
PALMER:
I am so sorry.

10:39.478 --> 10:41.260
I had no idea that
that was your parking spot.

10:41.304 --> 10:42.478
I swear.

10:42.521 --> 10:44.217
At ease, Palmer.

10:44.260 --> 10:46.260
I'm just here to check on
the case. Heard there were

10:46.304 --> 10:48.739
some unusual
characteristics about it.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.043
Still putting
it together.

10:50.086 --> 10:52.043
I'm not here
to disrupt that;

10:52.086 --> 10:54.521
just to get
an update.

10:54.565 --> 10:56.347
Is that a problem?

10:56.391 --> 10:59.130
No.

10:59.173 --> 11:01.608
Just don't see you
down here much.

11:01.652 --> 11:04.043
Things change.

11:04.086 --> 11:06.565
Dr. Mallard, tell me
what you know so far.

11:11.391 --> 11:13.478
Right. Let me
call you back.

11:13.521 --> 11:15.086
Ah, Agent--

11:15.130 --> 11:17.304
sorry--
Special Agent DiNozzo.

11:17.347 --> 11:20.826
C.I. Ray.[phone beeps]

11:20.869 --> 11:22.347
Need to get that?

11:22.391 --> 11:23.652
It can wait.

11:23.695 --> 11:25.043
Just wrapping up
an old case.

11:25.086 --> 11:26.739
Anything interesting?

11:26.782 --> 11:28.260
Can't talk about it.

11:28.304 --> 11:31.173
C.I. Ray business?
Yep.

11:31.217 --> 11:33.695
So, uh...

11:33.739 --> 11:35.304
How long you in town?

11:35.347 --> 11:37.000
As long as Ziva
will have me for.

11:37.043 --> 11:38.913
Yeah, she's a tough
nut to crack.

11:38.956 --> 11:42.478
But, you know, once
you navigate past that
Mossad-influenced exterior

11:42.521 --> 11:43.913
and her inability
to grasp

11:43.956 --> 11:45.652
cultural references,
she's great.

11:45.695 --> 11:47.782
I'm in love with her.

11:47.826 --> 11:48.956
That's why I'm here.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.739
To tell her?

11:51.782 --> 11:53.739
When are you
going to do that?

11:53.782 --> 11:56.434
I don't know.
Tonight, tomorrow--

11:56.478 --> 11:58.913
soon.

11:58.956 --> 12:03.391
You know, it feels good
to finally get it out.

12:03.434 --> 12:05.347
I'll bet.

12:05.391 --> 12:08.913
You know, I want Ziva's friends
to become my friends.

12:08.956 --> 12:11.652
She's told me how close
the two of you are.
[chuckles]

12:11.695 --> 12:14.739
I wouldn't say that.Well, she says you're
like a brother to her.

12:14.782 --> 12:17.043
[phone chirps]

12:17.086 --> 12:18.826
Meeting.

12:18.869 --> 12:20.782
Do me a favor--

12:20.826 --> 12:23.521
don't say
anything to Ziva.

12:23.565 --> 12:25.565
Hmm.

12:32.347 --> 12:34.695
Hey, I gotta go.

12:34.739 --> 12:36.173
Where are you off to?

12:36.217 --> 12:37.913
I have to see
an old associate,

12:37.956 --> 12:39.739
but it shouldn't
take too long, okay?Mm-hmm.

12:40.913 --> 12:42.565
Somebody sure
left in a hurry.

12:42.608 --> 12:43.913
He has work to do.

12:43.956 --> 12:46.391
Yeah, so do we.
Tell me what we got.

12:46.434 --> 12:47.913
Navy server showed
nothing unusual

12:47.956 --> 12:49.521
in Seaman Balfour's e-mails.

12:49.565 --> 12:51.608
But I did find this.

12:51.652 --> 12:55.695
Bank shows several charges
on his debit card over
the past four days.

12:55.739 --> 12:57.260
Various stores,
various amounts.

12:57.304 --> 12:58.782
TONY: Dead guy on
a shopping spree.

12:58.826 --> 13:00.043
Surveillance video?

13:00.086 --> 13:01.347
Abby's still analyzing.

13:01.391 --> 13:03.043
But so far, we've got

13:03.086 --> 13:05.260
no clear shot of the person
taking Balfour's identity.

13:05.304 --> 13:07.043
Seaman Balfour's
apartment manager

13:07.086 --> 13:08.782
says that someone
has been staying

13:08.826 --> 13:10.565
in his apartment
since last Friday.

13:10.608 --> 13:12.695
Day after he was murdered.You got a description?

13:12.739 --> 13:14.434
White male, unknown age.

13:14.478 --> 13:15.826
Is he there now?

13:15.869 --> 13:17.347
Manager saw him go
into the unit this morning,

13:17.391 --> 13:18.173
but never come out.

13:20.086 --> 13:21.826
DiNozzo, come on, let's go.

13:27.347 --> 13:29.173
It's 203.

13:33.478 --> 13:35.000
If you need,
I got the key.

13:36.391 --> 13:37.652
NCIS. Open up.

13:58.043 --> 13:59.521
Clear, boss.

14:03.913 --> 14:06.260
Tidy.
Not a thing out of place.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.000
Except for this.

14:15.652 --> 14:17.956
TONY: That is one
empty refrigerator.

14:37.695 --> 14:40.260
What the hell is that?

14:40.304 --> 14:43.086
WOMAN: He likes
leaving things behind.

14:46.521 --> 14:47.652
What? You just happened
to be in the neighborhood,

14:47.695 --> 14:49.304
Special Agent Barrett?

14:51.304 --> 14:53.043
Flower, huh?

14:53.086 --> 14:54.913
That's a new one.

14:54.956 --> 14:56.521
I'm going to take
a look around,

14:56.565 --> 14:57.739
see what else I can find.

14:57.782 --> 15:00.739
See what youcan find?

15:00.782 --> 15:04.347
I've been tracking the killer
the past nine months.

15:04.391 --> 15:06.869
Three dead Navy men
in three different ports.

15:06.913 --> 15:09.391
What's your connection?

15:09.434 --> 15:11.695
Case started in Rota, Spain.

15:11.739 --> 15:13.478
[trilling the R]:
Rota.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.260
Never been there.
Hear it's nice.

15:15.304 --> 15:18.086
Seaman Balfour's murder
fits the pattern,

15:18.130 --> 15:20.304
right down to the
funny little ice cubes.

15:20.347 --> 15:24.130
My killer, my case.

15:33.608 --> 15:35.782
What I was thinking is we...

15:38.173 --> 15:41.130
I'll have to call you back.

15:44.043 --> 15:46.391
I take it Agent Barrett
got settled in.

15:46.434 --> 15:48.434
Yeah, for the second time.

15:50.043 --> 15:52.391
You could have told me,
Director.

15:52.434 --> 15:53.695
It was need-to-know.

15:53.739 --> 15:55.826
You didn't,
so what's the problem?

15:55.869 --> 15:59.304
You kept me in the dark...
on purpose?

15:59.347 --> 16:02.217
It just landed
on our soil, Gibbs.

16:02.260 --> 16:03.739
I'm telling you now.

16:08.565 --> 16:10.565
Called the
"Port-to-Port Killer."

16:10.608 --> 16:13.000
Victims are all
Navy enlisted.

16:13.043 --> 16:14.869
Bodies found near bases

16:14.913 --> 16:16.347
in Sasebo, Guam, Rota.

16:16.391 --> 16:18.913
M.O.'s the same every time:
throats cut,

16:18.956 --> 16:22.086
redressed, thoroughly cleaned
and wrapped in plastic.

16:22.130 --> 16:24.521
No physical evidence
left behind.

16:24.565 --> 16:28.000
But he does always leave
some kind of object.That's a signature.

16:28.043 --> 16:30.000
Maybe.

16:30.043 --> 16:32.130
Bread crumbs.

16:35.304 --> 16:37.565
Left this near the
last body in Guam.

16:39.913 --> 16:41.869
GIBBS:
A peanut?
Boiled.

16:41.913 --> 16:43.739
Grown in southeastern
Virginia.

16:43.782 --> 16:47.130
Suggests that the killer may
be on his way to the States.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.608
Agent Barrett
was brought in last month

16:48.652 --> 16:50.173
in anticipation
of that move.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.217
Unfortunately,
we were right.

16:52.260 --> 16:54.304
Balfour was
the latest victim.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.434
But he won't be the last.

16:57.347 --> 16:58.913
The SecNav wants
the Port-to-Port Killer

16:58.956 --> 17:01.478
found and locked up fast.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.478
I suggest you get past
your issues

17:03.521 --> 17:05.173
with E.J. running the lead
on this

17:05.217 --> 17:06.782
and find him.

17:10.956 --> 17:13.391
You're quiet.

17:13.434 --> 17:15.260
I'm pensive.

17:15.304 --> 17:17.695
If this is some kind of game,
I'm not playing.

17:17.739 --> 17:19.217
No game.

17:19.260 --> 17:21.478
Oh, I get it.

17:21.521 --> 17:23.782
You don't like it
when I play boss lady.

17:23.826 --> 17:25.130
Would have been nice to know

17:25.173 --> 17:26.478
you'd be showing up
out of the blue like this.

17:26.521 --> 17:28.695
You just saw me last night.

17:28.739 --> 17:30.043
Yes, in my apartment,

17:30.086 --> 17:31.521
wearing my
Elvis Costello T-shirt

17:31.565 --> 17:33.391
which was extremely
gratifying,

17:33.434 --> 17:35.217
but I didn't expect you
at my crime scene--

17:35.260 --> 17:36.695
sifting through my evidence.

17:36.739 --> 17:40.043
Technically, it was
my crime scene and my evidence.

17:40.086 --> 17:42.391
Well, technically,
you could have mentioned it.

17:42.434 --> 17:44.043
It wasn't something
I could share.

17:44.086 --> 17:46.565
Maybe it was something
you didn't want to share.

17:48.652 --> 17:51.478
That thing is pissing me off.

17:51.521 --> 17:52.782
[Barrett growls]

17:52.826 --> 17:55.086
Just move this...

17:55.130 --> 17:58.608
And... [grunting]

18:00.347 --> 18:02.086
What?

18:02.130 --> 18:05.391
The skylight
and the computer screen--

18:05.434 --> 18:07.043
a way to avoid awkward moments.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.434
Intriguing.

18:08.478 --> 18:09.956
"A riddle wrapped
in a mystery

18:10.000 --> 18:11.347
wrapped in an enigma."

18:11.391 --> 18:14.739
Joe Pesci, Oliver
Stone's JFK--nice.

18:14.782 --> 18:17.695
Winston Churchill,
Russia, 1939.

18:19.086 --> 18:20.347
Smarty-pants.

18:23.608 --> 18:25.434
I don't think this is
going to work out.

18:25.478 --> 18:27.260
Not with us on the same case.
We should stop.

18:27.304 --> 18:28.347
Okay.

18:28.391 --> 18:31.434
Okay. Best we end it.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.521
Or not.

18:40.565 --> 18:41.652
Dinner my place?

18:41.695 --> 18:44.043
I'll bring wine.

18:51.695 --> 18:52.913
Got anything, Abbs?

18:52.956 --> 18:54.782
It's just that our crazed
lunatic killer

18:54.826 --> 18:57.217
also happens to be
a plant lover.

18:57.260 --> 18:59.869
After comparing
the flower that was found

18:59.913 --> 19:02.608
in Seaman Balfour's apartment
to dozens of species

19:02.652 --> 19:04.000
that are indigenous
to North America,

19:04.043 --> 19:05.217
I got a match.

19:05.260 --> 19:07.956
Behold the Pogonia
ophioglossoides.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.826
Also known as
the 'Snake-Mouth Orchid.

19:10.869 --> 19:12.565
It's a rare species, Gibbs--

19:12.608 --> 19:14.913
so rare it's been put
on the endangered list
in several states.

19:14.956 --> 19:16.000
Yeah, so?

19:16.043 --> 19:18.391
So, if P2P--

19:18.434 --> 19:21.217
Port-to-Port Killer--
I made that up myself--

19:21.260 --> 19:23.043
if P2P wants
to grow one,

19:23.086 --> 19:25.434
he would have to do it himself,
or find someone who could.

19:25.478 --> 19:27.173
He knows his plants.

19:27.217 --> 19:28.782
Oh, that's not
all he knows.

19:28.826 --> 19:30.826
Seaman Balfour's wounds

19:30.869 --> 19:33.173
were clean--
there were no ragged edges.

19:33.217 --> 19:35.391
The angle and the bevel of the
cut run in a straight line,

19:35.434 --> 19:36.913
so our weapon is...

19:36.956 --> 19:38.260
Surgical.
Yep.

19:38.304 --> 19:41.434
Yep, and it's a
perfect match to this.

19:41.478 --> 19:43.913
I also matched the cleanser
that was found on the body.

19:43.956 --> 19:47.043
It's an iodine-based scrub
called Xeonphine.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.913
It's made in Canada,
and it's only sold
to hospitals.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.565
So... we're looking for
someone in the medical field?

19:52.608 --> 19:54.869
What, a doctor maybe?Yeah, or a, a--

19:54.913 --> 19:56.434
a surgeon or a nurse maybe.

19:56.478 --> 19:59.173
Abbs, do you need a doctor?

20:01.304 --> 20:02.565
No, it's just...

20:02.608 --> 20:04.347
change, Gibbs.

20:04.391 --> 20:06.565
Change makes me itch.

20:06.608 --> 20:08.565
It always has.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.130
It's-it's Agent Barrett.

20:10.173 --> 20:12.130
I'm not a fan.

20:12.173 --> 20:13.652
I mean, of change.

20:13.695 --> 20:16.260
Her-- I don't mind.

20:16.304 --> 20:20.173
She's feisty
for someone so small.

20:20.217 --> 20:22.565
Um, and I like that.
Not that I like her,

20:22.608 --> 20:24.217
because I don't really...Abby.

20:24.260 --> 20:25.782
Not like I like you.
Abbs.

20:25.826 --> 20:27.391
I just-- I like our family
just the way it is.

20:28.956 --> 20:32.000
Nothing's going to change.

20:38.782 --> 20:40.869
I do not trust her.

20:40.913 --> 20:42.782
And I know that Gibbs
does not trust her.

20:42.826 --> 20:47.434
But she will be here
running lead until
we solve this case.

20:47.478 --> 20:49.130
I mean throwing in
someone new--

20:49.173 --> 20:50.521
it's never a good idea.

20:50.565 --> 20:52.521
Never.

20:52.565 --> 20:54.478
I'm sorry.

20:54.521 --> 20:57.000
I'm rambling.

20:57.043 --> 20:58.565
Mm-hmm.

20:58.608 --> 21:01.565
Okay, so enough
about my day.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.695
How was the meeting
with your associate?

21:03.739 --> 21:06.304
Can we talk about
something other than work?

21:06.347 --> 21:07.565
Just-- just for a while?

21:07.608 --> 21:09.608
A very little while?

21:11.043 --> 21:13.434
There's something

21:13.478 --> 21:16.217
that I want to tell you.Okay.

21:16.260 --> 21:18.260
I...[phone chimes]

21:18.304 --> 21:20.304
Ignore it.
Wait.

21:24.391 --> 21:26.304
Okay.

21:26.347 --> 21:28.086
I'm sorry.
That was...

21:28.130 --> 21:29.217
that was McGee.

21:29.260 --> 21:30.565
Hmm.
He had a question.

21:30.608 --> 21:32.304
Mm-hmm.

21:32.347 --> 21:34.043
What did you
need to tell me?

21:34.086 --> 21:35.956
Nothing.

21:37.086 --> 21:39.608
It can wait.

21:39.652 --> 21:41.043
BARRETT:
The Port-to-Port Killer

21:41.086 --> 21:42.826
is a highly
egotistical individual.

21:42.869 --> 21:47.000
He's lethal and
determined and...

21:47.043 --> 21:50.826
You're all welcome
to join me.

21:50.869 --> 21:53.000
I'm not really into yelling
from way over here.

21:53.043 --> 21:54.043
Yeah, we can hear you fine.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.565
Keep going.

22:06.913 --> 22:09.782
Suspect is a white male
anywhere from 25 to 55,

22:09.826 --> 22:11.434
never married,
no children.

22:11.478 --> 22:15.434
Born into money, he is charming,
charismatic and very entitled.

22:15.478 --> 22:18.956
Are you sure we're
not looking for Tony?

22:19.000 --> 22:22.130
He's killed in Japan, Guam,
Spain and now the U.S.

22:22.173 --> 22:24.217
No connection between any
of his victims

22:24.260 --> 22:27.173
besides the fact that they're
all Navy or former Navy.

22:27.217 --> 22:29.521
He is well-traveled,
multilingual,

22:29.565 --> 22:31.782
adapts to other cultures easily.

22:31.826 --> 22:34.000
And as you know,
his M.O. suggests

22:34.043 --> 22:36.000
he has medical training
of some kind.

22:36.043 --> 22:37.391
Doesn't tell us why
he gives them a promotion

22:37.434 --> 22:38.391
before he dumps them.

22:38.434 --> 22:40.304
Or why he leaves things behind.

22:40.347 --> 22:42.782
The flower from Balfour's
apartment told us nothing.

22:42.826 --> 22:44.608
Could indicate where
he's going next.

22:44.652 --> 22:46.086
I think he's still here.

22:46.130 --> 22:48.043
And he's not leaving
anytime soon.

22:48.086 --> 22:52.869
Is that a hunch,
Special Agent Barrett?

22:58.304 --> 23:01.043
We're talking about a
pathological individual!

23:01.086 --> 23:02.739
He's smart, incredibly
high-achieving...

23:02.782 --> 23:04.304
Oh, I doubt it.

23:04.347 --> 23:07.652
I think that these murders are
his biggest achievement.

23:07.695 --> 23:10.521
That a hunch, Agent Gibbs?

23:10.565 --> 23:12.956
[chuckles]

23:15.086 --> 23:17.347
Boss, I got something
here you should see.

23:19.826 --> 23:21.304
Excuse me.

23:25.086 --> 23:27.869
McGEE: It's from Seaman
Balfour's personal e-mail cache;

23:27.913 --> 23:29.782
most recent was
the morning of his death.

23:29.826 --> 23:31.043
TONY:
"You're crazy if you think

23:31.086 --> 23:32.782
"you're getting away
with this, Balfour.

23:32.826 --> 23:34.217
I'll kill you
before that happens."

23:34.260 --> 23:35.391
You got a name, McGee?

23:35.434 --> 23:38.173
Yep. 24-year-old Bryce Leitner,

23:38.217 --> 23:39.869
heir to the Leitner
timber fortune.

23:39.913 --> 23:42.130
Dropped out of med school
two years ago,

23:42.173 --> 23:45.347
been traveling
the world ever since.

23:45.391 --> 23:48.913
And he has visited Japan, Guam
and Spain in the past year.

23:48.956 --> 23:50.000
Do you have a location?

23:53.739 --> 23:56.956
Last known local address is
a condo in Georgetown.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.782
We can be done in ten
minutes, or here all day.

24:08.826 --> 24:09.826
It's up to you.

24:09.869 --> 24:13.695
I'm not saying anything.

24:13.739 --> 24:17.130
Let's talk about Sasebo, Japan.

24:17.173 --> 24:18.695
Why were you there?

24:24.956 --> 24:26.782
Starting without me,
Special Agent Barrett?

24:26.826 --> 24:30.565
We're just getting settled in.

24:30.608 --> 24:32.913
[papers slap on desk]

24:32.956 --> 24:34.565
[quietly]:
You're in my chair.

24:54.521 --> 24:56.608
Need to know why
you traveled

24:56.652 --> 24:58.000
so much the last year,
Mr. Leitner.

24:58.043 --> 25:00.521
You've been in D.C. two weeks?

25:02.173 --> 25:04.260
Yeah.

25:04.304 --> 25:07.347
And before you arrived here,
you were in

25:07.391 --> 25:09.434
Europe and
Southeast Asia.

25:09.478 --> 25:12.782
We have e-mails you sent

25:12.826 --> 25:14.869
threatening Seaman
Balfour's life.

25:14.913 --> 25:18.043
Yeah? So? I hated the guy.

25:18.086 --> 25:23.043
"Next time I see you,
I'll take your head off."

25:23.086 --> 25:26.043
[chuckles]
It's a figure of speech.

25:26.086 --> 25:28.347
Really?
Yeah.

25:28.391 --> 25:32.043
I find that funny.

25:32.086 --> 25:33.956
That's almost what
the killer did.

25:39.043 --> 25:42.391
You were in Japan,
Guam, Spain--

25:42.434 --> 25:43.869
Where were you a week ago?

25:43.913 --> 25:46.347
Let him answer my question,
Agent Gibbs.

25:46.391 --> 25:48.130
Why the threats to Balfour?

25:48.173 --> 25:50.086
Because that loser made
a move on my girl.

25:50.130 --> 25:51.826
Can you believe that?

25:51.869 --> 25:53.391
Low-class piece of...

25:56.695 --> 25:59.043
And just to spite me,

25:59.086 --> 26:00.739
she actually goes out
with the jerk.

26:00.782 --> 26:04.869
So I get screwed twice.

26:08.652 --> 26:10.739
Tell me, Bryce,

26:10.782 --> 26:13.652
what's it like to have it all?

26:13.695 --> 26:15.565
The looks, the money,

26:15.608 --> 26:18.043
world travel...

26:18.086 --> 26:19.130
the women?

26:22.478 --> 26:24.782
Excuse us.

26:24.826 --> 26:26.000
[smug laugh]

26:31.565 --> 26:33.434
There are standards in there.

26:33.478 --> 26:34.695
Rules.

26:34.739 --> 26:36.956
I can interrogate him
however I want.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.826
Different strokes, Gibbs.

26:38.869 --> 26:39.608
You weren't getting
anywhere with him

26:39.652 --> 26:41.043
and he's my suspect.

26:41.086 --> 26:42.434
That's my room.Vance put me in charge.

26:42.478 --> 26:43.608
Vance isn't here.

26:43.652 --> 26:45.130
I'm trying to establish
that he was

26:45.173 --> 26:47.130
in all four cities at the
same time of the murders.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.782
Focus on Balfour.

26:49.826 --> 26:51.434
That's our body,
that's our evidence,

26:51.478 --> 26:52.652
that's our case!

26:52.695 --> 26:54.043
This is a multiple murder case!

26:54.086 --> 26:56.217
Start by pinning
one murder on him,

26:56.260 --> 26:58.130
and then connect the others.
That's how it's done.

26:58.173 --> 27:00.608
Maybe that's the old-school way.

27:00.652 --> 27:03.478
It's my way.

27:03.521 --> 27:05.869
I'm calling Vance.

27:05.913 --> 27:08.695
I'll be talking to Leitner.

27:08.739 --> 27:10.304
Are you questioning
whether I know

27:10.347 --> 27:11.391
what I'm doing,
Agent Gibbs?

27:11.434 --> 27:13.086
No, ma'am.

27:13.130 --> 27:15.391
I'm questioning the way
you do it.

27:15.434 --> 27:18.826
[phone ringing]

27:18.869 --> 27:20.000
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

27:20.043 --> 27:22.652
Yeah, Abbs,
I'll be right there.

27:22.695 --> 27:24.739
Where are yougoing?

27:24.782 --> 27:25.869
Wherever you are.

27:31.739 --> 27:33.217
Did you guys have a fight?

27:33.260 --> 27:34.347
Yes.
No.

27:34.391 --> 27:36.217
Excuse me.

27:36.260 --> 27:38.086
Abbs, what do you got?

27:38.130 --> 27:41.652
Okay, so I ran Bryce Leitner's
name through every

27:41.695 --> 27:43.130
intelligence and law
enforcement database--

27:43.173 --> 27:46.478
AFIS, Interpol, DIA, CIA.
Point, Abby?

27:46.521 --> 27:49.086
Wow.
Abbs, come on.

27:49.130 --> 27:50.521
Okay, so Leitner's in
the system because

27:50.565 --> 27:52.260
of a DUI charge
in Virginia last year.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.347
Okay. And?

27:53.391 --> 27:55.695
And he gave blood.

27:55.739 --> 27:57.304
What does that have
to do with it?

27:57.347 --> 27:58.304
Only everything.

27:58.347 --> 28:01.565
That, my fearless leader, is

28:01.608 --> 28:05.347
the Spanish fishing village
of Rosa Verde.

28:05.391 --> 28:08.434
There was a viral outbreak there
last July.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.434
About a thousand people were
infected.

28:10.478 --> 28:14.043
Leitner's blood had traces
of the pertussis virus.

28:14.086 --> 28:15.434
Exactly. Which means...

28:15.478 --> 28:17.956
He was in Spain at the
same time as the Rota murder.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.260
And he was here in D.C. on the
date that Balfour was killed.

28:22.739 --> 28:24.652
Looks like my suspect is
panning out, Agent Gibbs.

28:24.695 --> 28:26.173
[phone rings]

28:28.434 --> 28:30.913
Barrett.

28:30.956 --> 28:32.739
Do you want to talk
about it?

28:43.434 --> 28:47.173
I'm telling you, you mess
with the Great White,

28:47.217 --> 28:49.652
you're gonna get eaten.

28:49.695 --> 28:51.304
I'm not afraid of him.

28:51.347 --> 28:54.304
That's your first mistake.

28:54.347 --> 28:56.260
Look, there's
a pretty good chance

28:56.304 --> 28:58.086
I just caught
the Port-to-Port Killer.

28:58.130 --> 28:59.521
Besides, Gibbs isn't

28:59.565 --> 29:02.478
exactly in Vance's
good graces these days.

29:02.521 --> 29:04.043
There's your second mistake.

29:04.086 --> 29:06.347
I get the feeling they're
not on the best of terms,

29:06.391 --> 29:07.826
and Vance outranks him.

29:07.869 --> 29:09.869
[chuckles]
Okay...

29:09.913 --> 29:12.260
I've seen a few
directors come and go.

29:12.304 --> 29:14.913
There's only been one
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

29:14.956 --> 29:16.260
Do the math.

29:16.304 --> 29:19.826
Yeah, and there's only one
Anthony DiNozzo.

29:19.869 --> 29:21.739
Actually,
there are two.

29:21.782 --> 29:24.434
You know, this case
may take me more

29:24.478 --> 29:26.913
than a few weeks
for me to wrap up.

29:26.956 --> 29:28.478
And?

29:28.521 --> 29:33.000
And I'm just saying,
I could get used to this.

29:33.043 --> 29:37.869
I like the city life
and these offices,

29:37.913 --> 29:39.869
despite that
ridiculous skylight.

29:39.913 --> 29:41.391
Well, you get
used to that.

29:41.434 --> 29:44.260
Well, then maybe your
coworkers could get used

29:44.304 --> 29:47.434
to the idea of me
being here on a more...

29:47.478 --> 29:48.565
permanent basis.

29:48.608 --> 29:52.043
I look at you and how

29:52.086 --> 29:54.913
you've made this place
work for yourself.

29:54.956 --> 29:56.304
And it's your home.

29:56.347 --> 29:58.521
It's all about the
people around you.

29:58.565 --> 30:00.086
Yeah.

30:00.130 --> 30:02.173
I'm starting to get that.

30:04.869 --> 30:07.347
Agent David,
C.I. Ray.

30:07.391 --> 30:08.608
Stop calling him that.

30:08.652 --> 30:10.652
It's okay.

30:10.695 --> 30:11.478
I kinda like it.

30:11.521 --> 30:13.173
[Ziva chuckles]

30:13.217 --> 30:15.043
Agent Cruz.

30:15.086 --> 30:16.956
Wait-- uh, do you two know
each other?

30:17.000 --> 30:19.434
Well, yeah.
Didn't he tell you?

30:19.478 --> 30:21.000
Tell me what?

30:21.043 --> 30:24.956
Ray's our CIA liaison
with NCIS on

30:25.000 --> 30:26.608
the Port-to-
Port Killer case.

30:26.652 --> 30:28.217
He has been
from the start.

30:36.347 --> 30:37.608
Look, I...

30:37.652 --> 30:39.000
No.

30:40.956 --> 30:43.130
ZIVA: Okay, well,
you lied to me, Ray.

30:43.173 --> 30:44.956
I mean, what does
the CIA call it?

30:45.000 --> 30:46.565
Do the call it "disinformation"?
A cover story?

30:46.608 --> 30:48.000
I was protecting
you, okay?

30:48.043 --> 30:49.956
I do not need
protection!

30:50.000 --> 30:51.217
It was need-to-know
information.

30:51.260 --> 30:54.521
I was not allowed
to tell you, period.

30:54.565 --> 30:56.000
Did you sleep
with Agent Barrett?

30:56.043 --> 30:58.000
No, no. And if I did,

30:58.043 --> 31:01.043
I would have told you about it.

31:01.086 --> 31:02.521
I didn't come here
for this case, Ziva.

31:02.565 --> 31:03.739
I came here for you.

31:03.782 --> 31:05.000
Oh, just stop it! Stop it!

31:05.043 --> 31:07.217
Was any of it real?
Yes.

31:07.260 --> 31:09.260
Were you just planning
on using me

31:09.304 --> 31:10.695
to get information,
just in case

31:10.739 --> 31:11.913
things with Barrett
didn't pan out?

31:11.956 --> 31:13.173
I mean, was that it?!

31:13.217 --> 31:15.130
I mean, am I part of this
back-up plan?

31:15.173 --> 31:16.434
No, you're overreacting.

31:16.478 --> 31:18.782
Oh, my gosh!
You want to see
me overreact, Ray?

31:18.826 --> 31:20.565
Why don't you tell me
another lie?

31:20.608 --> 31:22.565
Why don't you tell me
the sky is yellow?

31:22.608 --> 31:24.652
Why don't you tell me
that water is not wet

31:24.695 --> 31:27.086
or that sand is not dry?

31:27.130 --> 31:29.043
Why don't you tell me
that you love me?

31:29.086 --> 31:30.086
I love you.

31:30.130 --> 31:33.652
I love you, Ziva.

31:35.391 --> 31:37.217
I don't believe you.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.565
What about our time in
Miami, huh?

31:42.608 --> 31:46.217
The trips?

31:46.260 --> 31:48.260
What about
the romantic dinners?

31:48.304 --> 31:49.521
I mean, was...

31:49.565 --> 31:51.521
was that all part of your plan?

31:51.565 --> 31:54.391
Mm-mm. It was real.

31:54.434 --> 31:55.608
It isreal.

31:55.652 --> 31:56.782
We are real.

31:58.478 --> 32:00.217
I wish I could believe you.

32:02.695 --> 32:03.956
You have the wrong guy.

32:07.608 --> 32:10.913
Leitner-- he's not the
Port-to-Port Killer.

32:10.956 --> 32:14.000
He's a mule for
the Syrian government.

32:14.043 --> 32:15.739
We've been watching his every
move for the last 16 months,

32:15.782 --> 32:17.608
and there's no way he could
have killed any of them.

32:20.043 --> 32:22.521
You didn't hear this from me.

32:43.478 --> 32:45.000
Gibbs, I got to
talk to you.

32:47.173 --> 32:49.434
I need to tell you something.

32:51.043 --> 32:52.434
I cannot tell you

32:52.478 --> 32:54.652
how I know this,
and you cannot ask.

32:54.695 --> 32:57.521
All right.
Tell me what?

32:57.565 --> 33:02.130
Bryce Leitner is not
the Port-to-Port Killer.

33:02.173 --> 33:04.695
How sure are you?

33:04.739 --> 33:07.391
Very.

33:07.434 --> 33:10.391
Okay.

33:14.173 --> 33:17.130
Turns out our chief suspect
isn't the Port-to-Port Killer.

33:17.173 --> 33:19.608
How can you be so sure?

33:24.260 --> 33:26.043
Reliable source.

33:26.086 --> 33:27.304
How reliable?

33:27.347 --> 33:29.391
Very.

33:29.434 --> 33:31.086
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

33:31.130 --> 33:32.608
It means Leitner has

33:32.652 --> 33:34.652
alibis for all three
international murders.

33:34.695 --> 33:36.347
Still leaves our local body.

33:36.391 --> 33:40.043
McGee, Balfour: crime
scene photos. Put'em up.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.478
BARRETT:
Look, I've been on this case

33:41.521 --> 33:43.478
for nine months.

33:43.521 --> 33:46.347
I've studied every piece
of evidence; I've studied

33:46.391 --> 33:48.478
these photos a hundred times
in the last 24 hours.

33:48.521 --> 33:49.695
Yeah, well, we're
going to study them again.

33:54.391 --> 33:55.739
Go close-up on his decorations.

33:59.043 --> 34:00.739
What?

34:02.130 --> 34:03.652
Service Warfare Pin.

34:03.695 --> 34:04.913
Four Navy air medals.

34:04.956 --> 34:06.043
Distinguished Flying Cross.

34:06.086 --> 34:07.347
There's no way a Black Shoe

34:07.391 --> 34:08.391
could have a Distinguished
Flying Cross

34:08.434 --> 34:09.826
and four air medals.

34:09.869 --> 34:12.304
Boss, this guy should
have pilot wings.

34:12.347 --> 34:13.869
So the killer
made a mistake

34:13.913 --> 34:15.956
when re-dressing the victim?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.086
Has he ever made
a mistake before?

34:18.130 --> 34:20.043
Never.

34:20.086 --> 34:22.260
The guy's meticulous.

34:22.304 --> 34:24.565
This is a message.
He wanted us to see these.

34:24.608 --> 34:26.869
McGee, put up a map
of the murders.

34:28.652 --> 34:29.782
All port cities.

34:29.826 --> 34:31.913
I've already
been over this.Airports?

34:31.956 --> 34:34.347
And I've already checked
the flight manifests

34:34.391 --> 34:36.173
for all passengers...Not interested in
passengers. Hubs.

34:36.217 --> 34:38.739
Hubs?
Hubs.

34:38.782 --> 34:40.565
Ziva. McGee.

34:40.608 --> 34:41.826
MTAC, now.

34:47.043 --> 34:49.173
Stay.

34:54.869 --> 34:57.086
Told you not to play
with the Great White.

35:02.695 --> 35:04.652
McGEE:
Homeland just had
FAA transfer all

35:04.695 --> 35:07.391
encrypted flight
watch data.
Do it.

35:09.434 --> 35:11.652
Airlines servicing
all four cities

35:11.695 --> 35:14.173
where the Port-to-Port
Killer struck.

35:14.217 --> 35:15.652
McGEE:
Well, there's four airlines

35:15.695 --> 35:17.347
that service Sasebo and Guam,

35:17.391 --> 35:19.608
but not Rota.

35:19.652 --> 35:21.478
There's only one that

35:21.521 --> 35:23.521
services all three
cities and D.C.--

35:23.565 --> 35:25.478
Espree Airlines.

35:25.521 --> 35:27.260
They go to all four
international hubs,

35:27.304 --> 35:28.869
as well as Reagan
and Dulles.

35:28.913 --> 35:30.739
Cities are
transfer points.

35:30.782 --> 35:33.434
Meaning stopover points
for pilots, flight crew,

35:33.478 --> 35:35.260
stewards and
maintenance workers.

35:35.304 --> 35:37.304
Checking the employee records
for Espree Airlines.

35:38.478 --> 35:40.000
All right.

35:40.043 --> 35:41.565
Now these are the names of
the various flight personnel

35:41.608 --> 35:43.086
who had stopovers
in the cities

35:43.130 --> 35:44.173
where the Port-to-Port
murders occurred.

35:44.217 --> 35:45.913
How many served
in the U.S. Navy?

35:47.913 --> 35:50.521
Six.
How many were in
all four cities

35:50.565 --> 35:51.782
at the times of
all four murders?

35:55.347 --> 35:56.782
One.

35:56.826 --> 35:58.913
Nathan Finney,
U.S. Navy, retired.

35:58.956 --> 36:00.000
Put him up.

36:02.391 --> 36:04.608
F-18 jockey,
top of his

36:04.652 --> 36:06.956
Top Gun class
in San Diego.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.565
Served in Gulf Wars
One and Two.

36:08.608 --> 36:10.391
That explains
the decorations.

36:10.434 --> 36:12.869
80 bombing sorties
in downtown Baghdad.

36:15.043 --> 36:16.652
Our killer's a war hero?

36:16.695 --> 36:19.086
Give me an address.

36:20.782 --> 36:22.391
Just outside
Alexandria.

36:58.173 --> 36:59.217
Clear!

37:00.782 --> 37:01.913
Clear!

37:03.086 --> 37:04.043
Clear.

37:14.913 --> 37:16.782
Nothing here, boss.

37:27.347 --> 37:30.086
Out here!

37:53.130 --> 37:55.304
Nathan Finney, with a bad case
of freezer burn.

38:00.260 --> 38:04.260
JIMMY:
Whew. Heat wave in Autopsy.

38:04.304 --> 38:06.521
I guess there really
is global warming.

38:06.565 --> 38:08.173
[Ducky groans]

38:08.217 --> 38:11.956
Yeah, Autopsy is indeed
topsy-turvy today, Mr. Palmer.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.956
Nice alliteration
Doctor.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.391
What do we got?

38:15.434 --> 38:17.565
Based on the depth,

38:17.608 --> 38:21.565
angle of penetration, and the
keenness of the blade, I'd say

38:21.608 --> 38:23.347
it was...Same scalpel as
the murders.

38:23.391 --> 38:26.000
Yes. Carotid artery
and windpipe severed

38:26.043 --> 38:27.130
with great precision.

38:27.173 --> 38:28.391
You have a time of death?

38:28.434 --> 38:30.869
I'd say he's been
dead and frozen

38:30.913 --> 38:32.217
for at least six weeks.

38:33.652 --> 38:35.956
VANCE:
So you've got

38:36.000 --> 38:37.130
one more dead body,

38:37.173 --> 38:39.000
but no Port-to-Port
Killer, is that right?.

38:39.043 --> 38:40.739
We're confident
we're closing in.

38:40.782 --> 38:43.043
Good, because
SecNav tasked me

38:43.086 --> 38:45.260
to solve this case.
So, I'm to tell him what?

38:45.304 --> 38:47.217
We got a bouquet of flowers,

38:47.260 --> 38:49.565
some more ice,
and no suspects.

38:49.608 --> 38:51.173
Leon.I put both of you

38:51.217 --> 38:52.347
on this case
to double the chances

38:52.391 --> 38:54.000
of catching this lunatic.

38:54.043 --> 38:57.130
Now I'm wondering if I didn't
double his chances of escaping.

38:57.173 --> 38:59.217
Look, I don't care
how you do it--

38:59.260 --> 39:00.956
together, apart,

39:01.000 --> 39:02.565
mean, nice--

39:02.608 --> 39:05.086
just get it done.

39:18.608 --> 39:21.000
So I guess we're
still partners.

39:21.043 --> 39:23.652
See you in the morning,
Special Agent Barrett.

39:29.608 --> 39:30.826
You sleeping
with DiNozzo?

39:30.869 --> 39:34.000
[laughs]

39:34.043 --> 39:36.826
It's not against NCIS policy
to date co-workers.

39:36.869 --> 39:39.782
It's against my policy.

39:39.826 --> 39:41.608
This team operates
on respect.

39:41.652 --> 39:43.000
You don't respect me...

39:43.043 --> 39:45.608
No. I don't trust you.

39:45.652 --> 39:48.130
Really?
Really.

39:48.173 --> 39:49.739
Except to work the case,

39:49.782 --> 39:52.739
leave my team alone.

39:52.782 --> 39:54.217
We clear?

40:00.869 --> 40:02.739
[bluesy ballad playing quietly]

40:11.000 --> 40:12.347
Hey.

40:12.391 --> 40:14.000
Shouldn't drink alone;
it's too depressing.

40:14.043 --> 40:16.565
It's a club soda, and
I'm not depressed.
Well...

40:16.608 --> 40:18.782
I wouldn't blame you.
It's been a rough day.

40:18.826 --> 40:21.043
Maybe for you.
I'm fine.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.608
If you were fine,
you wouldn't be here.

40:22.652 --> 40:24.130
Okay, then.
Let's go.

40:24.173 --> 40:25.652
I would like a drink.

40:25.695 --> 40:27.434
And it is depressing
to drink alone.

40:29.478 --> 40:30.652
Barkeep!

40:30.695 --> 40:32.869
Anything old and gold.

40:32.913 --> 40:33.739
I might be
getting a cold.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.521
Sorry.
Scotch on the rocks.

40:36.565 --> 40:37.608
Thank you.

40:37.652 --> 40:38.521
BARKEEP:
Comin' up!

40:41.347 --> 40:43.565
He's CIA.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.739
They have a sworn duty to
protect what they know.

40:45.782 --> 40:47.565
Same as we do.

40:47.608 --> 40:48.739
He was just
doing his job.

40:48.782 --> 40:50.347
He lied to me, Tony.

40:50.391 --> 40:54.521
Yeah. Because...

40:54.565 --> 40:56.130
he cares about you.

40:56.173 --> 41:00.130
Does not matter,
because it's over.

41:00.173 --> 41:02.130
Scotch, sir.

41:02.173 --> 41:04.739
What about
you and EJ?

41:04.782 --> 41:07.695
What about us?

41:10.086 --> 41:12.695
What are you going to do
when Gibbs finds out?

41:14.173 --> 41:18.652
I understand this one, Ziva.
I understand her.

41:18.695 --> 41:20.304
That's why
it's working.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.217
This is for you.

41:26.260 --> 41:28.130
I didn't order that.

41:28.173 --> 41:29.782
Guy in the booth did.

41:37.956 --> 41:40.173
I wonder who?
