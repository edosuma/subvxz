00:22.792 --> 00:24.640
Was that necessary?

00:24.760 --> 00:26.280
You said we were late.

00:27.213 --> 00:28.722
Now, we're not.

00:44.809 --> 00:46.261
Tell me about the client.

00:46.381 --> 00:47.617
Stefan Novik.

00:47.654 --> 00:50.818
A billionaire forced out
of Crimea by the Russians.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.621
What's his business with me?

00:52.654 --> 00:54.064
His aide wouldn't say.

00:54.066 --> 00:56.343
He insisted the two of
you meet face to face.

00:56.791 --> 00:58.657
Why did you agree?

00:58.986 --> 01:02.380
He's paying your full fee,
whether you take the job or not.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.260
It's remarkably generous.

01:05.288 --> 01:06.447
Or desperate.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.700
- Mr. Martin?
- Mm-hmm.

01:08.718 --> 01:11.480
Please take a seat. Mr.
Novik will see you shortly.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.742
Thank you.

01:17.581 --> 01:18.715
Mr. Martin?

01:18.835 --> 01:19.904
Dassin...

01:20.180 --> 01:21.441
A pleasure.

01:21.935 --> 01:22.849
My colleague.

01:23.380 --> 01:24.793
Caterina Boldieu.

01:24.913 --> 01:26.243
Enchanté.

01:29.450 --> 01:30.718
Mr. Martin...

01:31.340 --> 01:32.953
Monsieur Dassin...

01:33.073 --> 01:35.127
Mr. Novik will see you now.

01:43.231 --> 01:44.596
You know him?

01:45.062 --> 01:46.873
He's a transporter.

01:49.827 --> 01:51.327
I'm sorry, Mr. Martin,

01:51.355 --> 01:54.244
Mr. Novik would like to
see the two of you alone.

01:54.290 --> 01:56.494
It's okay. Ms. Boldieu is with me.

01:56.531 --> 01:58.671
I'm afraid Mr. Novik insists.

01:58.879 --> 02:00.592
I'm afraid I do too.

02:01.296 --> 02:02.963
Of course. Forgive me.

02:03.083 --> 02:04.333
This way.

02:12.759 --> 02:13.811
Please...

02:13.931 --> 02:15.064
Sit down.

02:16.006 --> 02:17.707
Thank you for coming.

02:19.499 --> 02:20.680
Gentlemen,

02:20.800 --> 02:22.134
Ms. Boldieu,

02:22.405 --> 02:24.384
I know your time's precious,

02:24.390 --> 02:26.119
so I'll get to the point.

02:29.508 --> 02:31.218
This was my home,

02:31.510 --> 02:32.710
in Sevastopol.

02:33.047 --> 02:34.877
Before the Russians invaded

02:34.914 --> 02:36.963
and I was forced into exile.

02:37.083 --> 02:38.380
Next please.

02:40.449 --> 02:43.220
This painting hangs upstairs.

02:43.677 --> 02:47.583
It's by the great Crimean
artist, Aivasovsky.

02:48.546 --> 02:49.927
Quite beautiful, isn't it?

02:50.128 --> 02:51.866
And quite valuable.

02:52.296 --> 02:54.064
Not for the reason you think.

02:54.266 --> 02:55.753
It's a forgery.

02:57.603 --> 02:59.586
A spectrometer

03:00.238 --> 03:02.820
reveals its true value.

03:04.951 --> 03:08.445
Legal title to the
nation's mineral deposits.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.759
Hidden in the canvas.

03:11.317 --> 03:13.393
The deposits are worth

03:13.418 --> 03:15.899
3 billion US dollars,

03:16.384 --> 03:17.784
but under new Russian law,

03:17.811 --> 03:21.825
you need a certified
document to prove ownership.

03:21.827 --> 03:26.227
So, you see why it's vital I retrieve it.

03:26.798 --> 03:28.898
Why two transporters?

03:29.018 --> 03:34.220
All my wealth rests in that
piece of paper, Mr. Martin.

03:35.126 --> 03:39.059
So, I need to be sure at
least one of you will succeed.

03:40.221 --> 03:43.523
I'm sorry Mr. Novik, but I
don't engage in competitions.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.590
This is not a competition.

03:45.983 --> 03:47.317
Please.

03:47.748 --> 03:50.181
You both have been paid, right?

03:50.920 --> 03:52.187
And I will give

03:52.307 --> 03:55.129
a one million dollar bonus

03:55.158 --> 03:57.534
to whoever retrieves the title.

03:58.614 --> 04:00.342
It's well worth it.

04:02.098 --> 04:03.833
And if we both fail?

04:04.634 --> 04:05.900
Quite simply?

04:06.469 --> 04:07.894
I'd be ruined.

04:09.331 --> 04:12.367
A man without country or resources.

04:13.273 --> 04:16.382
As you can see, failure is not an option.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.874
I'm sorry Mr. Novik, but

04:19.911 --> 04:22.142
this job is just too high risk.

04:23.686 --> 04:25.270
Surely not.

04:27.237 --> 04:29.944
Crimea is under Russian occupation.

04:30.860 --> 04:32.543
That piece of paper

04:32.663 --> 04:35.323
makes me a $3 billion target.

04:36.796 --> 04:38.632
You know that.

04:38.752 --> 04:41.058
Or you wouldn't want to hire two men...

04:41.452 --> 04:43.738
and pay them so generously.

04:45.007 --> 04:46.930
Oh, I see.

04:47.050 --> 04:48.976
I'm sure you'll be in good hands,

04:49.177 --> 04:50.808
with Monsieur Dassin.

04:51.113 --> 04:52.409
Good luck.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.210
Madam.

05:09.300 --> 05:10.306
Well...

05:11.175 --> 05:12.464
What now?

05:13.406 --> 05:16.333
Perhaps he needs to be
approached differently.

06:03.118 --> 06:05.889
This one's a convicted narcotics trafficker.

06:05.898 --> 06:08.807
He wants safe passage
from Mexico to the U.S.

06:09.063 --> 06:10.033
No.

06:10.399 --> 06:11.437
Right.

06:11.557 --> 06:13.558
Four more drug dealers...

06:13.678 --> 06:16.060
three packages, contents unknown...

06:16.180 --> 06:17.954
two fugitives...

06:18.557 --> 06:19.783
No.

06:20.332 --> 06:21.758
That's all I got.

06:24.503 --> 06:26.313
Guess I get a holiday then.

06:27.685 --> 06:28.993
You tired?

06:31.810 --> 06:33.374
It is what it is.

06:36.820 --> 06:40.012
You want a challenge? You
should've taken the job today.

06:42.308 --> 06:43.234
Really?

06:43.259 --> 06:44.841
Of course not.

06:45.289 --> 06:46.579
You were right.

06:46.958 --> 06:48.363
I didn't trust that guy.

06:50.793 --> 06:52.041
It's late.

06:54.565 --> 06:57.091
We've got an early flight tomorrow morning.

06:59.436 --> 07:00.529
Good night.

07:00.649 --> 07:01.938
Good night.

07:15.868 --> 07:17.176
Good evening.

07:17.414 --> 07:19.804
I apologize for coming unannounced.

07:19.924 --> 07:21.906
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

07:22.026 --> 07:23.853
I gave you my answer, Mr. Novik.

07:23.880 --> 07:24.832
Yes, but...

07:24.877 --> 07:26.643
this job has certain...

07:27.063 --> 07:28.784
aspects...

07:29.299 --> 07:31.527
you might want to be aware of.

07:32.769 --> 07:34.682
Two minutes of your time, please?

07:36.039 --> 07:37.086
Okay,

07:37.206 --> 07:39.085
- come in.
- Thank you.

07:42.411 --> 07:44.866
The man now living in my house

07:44.893 --> 07:46.997
is Vitaly Kunsdt.

07:48.003 --> 07:50.921
The head of the Ministry
of Internal Affairs.

07:51.498 --> 07:53.537
Former KGB agent.

07:55.959 --> 07:58.169
Not a very nice man, I'm told.

07:58.965 --> 08:00.528
You're right.

08:00.648 --> 08:03.664
A long list of people he's
murdered or disappeared.

08:03.784 --> 08:07.372
You might be familiar with this case.

08:08.408 --> 08:12.554
The unexplained disappearance
of Miss Zara Knight,

08:12.953 --> 08:14.316
in Marseilles,

08:14.609 --> 08:16.054
2011...

08:17.613 --> 08:19.758
Are you investigating me, Mr. Novik?

08:20.243 --> 08:21.935
Oh, please no.

08:22.183 --> 08:24.295
Don't take offense, Mr. Martin.

08:24.606 --> 08:27.606
It's a measure of how
highly I value your work.

08:29.307 --> 08:33.587
Those files I obtained
from the Russian Ministry.

08:35.024 --> 08:36.652
Obtained how?

08:37.365 --> 08:39.395
Does it really matter?

08:40.568 --> 08:42.323
I've had them translated for you.

08:43.602 --> 08:45.286
It indicates

08:45.406 --> 08:47.522
Kunsdt either ordered...

08:47.642 --> 08:49.860
Mrs. Knight's abduction.

08:49.887 --> 08:51.168
Or...

08:51.288 --> 08:53.445
took her himself.

08:57.451 --> 08:59.537
Why are you telling me this?

09:01.091 --> 09:02.911
I know this case

09:02.956 --> 09:05.325
is of a great personal importance to you,

09:05.353 --> 09:06.697
Mr. Martin.

09:07.961 --> 09:11.578
My only interest is in that title.

09:12.240 --> 09:13.346
But,

09:14.100 --> 09:16.512
if in the course of retrieving it,

09:16.537 --> 09:18.405
something else should happen...

09:18.525 --> 09:19.859
say...

09:20.427 --> 09:21.935
the Minister were...

09:22.055 --> 09:23.600
questioned...

09:24.410 --> 09:26.436
or even killed, well...

09:27.080 --> 09:29.134
That's not my affair.

09:31.347 --> 09:32.783
This is the address

09:32.820 --> 09:35.719
where Monsieur Dassin
will depart in the morning.

09:36.918 --> 09:39.433
I'd very much like you to be there.

09:42.570 --> 09:43.877
Thank you.

10:18.084 --> 10:20.700
_

10:22.008 --> 10:25.209
_

10:56.480 --> 10:59.123
_

11:05.845 --> 11:06.345
_

11:28.565 --> 11:30.147
Frank...

11:33.083 --> 11:34.986
Frank...

12:48.368 --> 12:50.444
- Yes?
- It's me.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.960
- Hey.
- Hey...

12:54.080 --> 12:56.380
I changed my mind, I'm taking the Novik job.

12:56.709 --> 12:57.935
What?

12:58.618 --> 13:01.286
Left my things in the room,
will you take them home?

13:01.488 --> 13:03.270
You don't want me to come with you?

13:03.605 --> 13:05.499
I'll call you if I need you.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.411
Are you sure you're okay?

13:07.531 --> 13:08.646
Fine.

13:31.273 --> 13:32.618
Mr. Martin.

13:35.498 --> 13:37.118
I see you've changed your mind.

13:37.238 --> 13:38.947
Seems that way.

13:39.816 --> 13:41.407
Damn, I'm good!

13:42.542 --> 13:44.206
And you are?

13:44.707 --> 13:47.234
Oh hey, yeah, I'm Jules...

13:47.243 --> 13:49.877
Faroux, I'm Dassin's mechanic.

13:50.737 --> 13:51.999
Frank Martin.

13:52.018 --> 13:53.782
Nice to meet you.

13:54.222 --> 13:57.286
I just adjusting the
electronic control unit.

13:57.487 --> 13:59.573
- These new systems are...
- That's enough!

14:00.359 --> 14:01.804
Right.

14:17.009 --> 14:18.436
Mr. Martin...

14:19.113 --> 14:21.390
I'm pleased to see you.

14:22.844 --> 14:24.756
Forged passports,

14:24.876 --> 14:28.582
as well as Russian currency,
and disposable mobile phones.

14:28.972 --> 14:32.334
You'll find the address
of a safe house as well.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.551
You can collect weapons there.

14:34.755 --> 14:37.478
Better not to carry any across the border.

14:38.792 --> 14:40.121
Good luck, gentlemen.

14:54.308 --> 14:56.415
We could team up on this.

14:57.750 --> 14:59.369
Split the bonus.

15:00.924 --> 15:02.332
I work alone.

16:09.381 --> 16:12.239
Kind of surprised he
hasn't tried to pass us yet.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.400
This isn't a race.

16:17.645 --> 16:19.538
Frank Martin knows that.

16:58.305 --> 17:00.198
Stop, stop!

17:02.765 --> 17:04.460
Passport.

17:14.103 --> 17:15.430
Hey look.

17:21.489 --> 17:23.098
Not so far behind after all.

17:23.117 --> 17:24.425
Passport.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.556
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, thank you.

17:38.488 --> 17:40.253
You wait.

17:54.651 --> 17:56.564
Something's going on back there.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.446
Looks like he's in trouble.

17:58.487 --> 18:01.501
He's a big boy. He can take care of it.

20:59.658 --> 21:01.167
Oh, Caterina...

21:01.196 --> 21:02.758
How nice to see you.

21:07.020 --> 21:08.437
Is everything all right?

21:08.638 --> 21:09.971
I'm not sure.

21:10.167 --> 21:12.509
I need to ask you about a missing person.

21:12.629 --> 21:13.862
Zara Knight.

21:16.245 --> 21:17.914
Does Frank know you're here?

21:17.951 --> 21:18.920
No.

21:20.016 --> 21:22.317
Better you talk to him first.

21:22.437 --> 21:24.975
I can't. He took a job
in Crimea this morning.

21:24.993 --> 21:26.121
Crimea?

21:26.356 --> 21:29.256
I think it connects to
this woman's disappearance.

21:29.458 --> 21:30.939
I just don't know how.

21:32.528 --> 21:33.461
Oh...

21:33.696 --> 21:35.915
My manners, please, come in.

21:42.504 --> 21:43.919
You smell that?

21:44.039 --> 21:45.326
What is it?

21:45.573 --> 21:47.283
Bouillabaisse.

21:48.176 --> 21:50.826
I make the best in the world.

21:50.946 --> 21:53.174
If you say so yourself.

21:53.215 --> 21:55.415
The secret which I

21:55.535 --> 21:58.767
only share with beautiful
women such as yourself...

21:58.887 --> 22:01.864
is a splash of pastis.

22:02.490 --> 22:04.059
Would you like some?

22:06.044 --> 22:08.505
I would like to know about Zara Knight.

22:14.356 --> 22:15.655
Wine?

22:17.204 --> 22:21.444
She was a U.N. diplomat.

22:21.775 --> 22:23.609
Frank transported her

22:23.639 --> 22:26.319
to a peace conference in Marseille.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.687
And what happened?

22:29.401 --> 22:31.465
Frank would never say, but...

22:31.585 --> 22:33.654
I think they were in love.

22:34.688 --> 22:36.455
How did she disappear?

22:36.890 --> 22:39.417
There were threats against her life.

22:39.444 --> 22:40.880
But no one knows.

22:40.926 --> 22:43.002
She simply vanished.

22:43.830 --> 22:46.140
Must have been awful for Frank.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.551
Do you know a man named Novik?

22:50.502 --> 22:51.564
No.

22:51.948 --> 22:55.407
He's an oligarch in exile from Crimea.

22:55.424 --> 22:59.549
He hired Frank to retrieve
something from Sevastopol.

23:00.729 --> 23:02.862
I don't see a connection, Caterina.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.579
Neither do I but...

23:04.616 --> 23:05.933
Frank does.

23:08.219 --> 23:09.600
Well...

23:10.055 --> 23:12.491
I still have my files on the case.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.262
I could share them with you.

25:27.822 --> 25:29.652
How was the bouillabaisse?

25:30.567 --> 25:32.515
Best I ever had.

25:34.327 --> 25:36.513
What did I tell you?

25:38.241 --> 25:40.007
How is it going?

25:40.734 --> 25:43.340
You did a very thorough investigation.

25:43.834 --> 25:46.459
Yeah, but I found no suspects.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.188
And no motive.

25:51.779 --> 25:54.495
When someone disappears
like that, you know...

25:55.314 --> 25:56.620
Frank...

25:57.307 --> 25:59.182
He was devastated.

26:35.955 --> 26:37.635
You made it.

26:37.681 --> 26:38.934
Seems so.

26:39.758 --> 26:41.395
Nice ride.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.295
Frank.

26:54.039 --> 26:55.366
Care for a glass?

26:55.486 --> 26:56.234
No.

26:56.354 --> 26:57.386
Thank you.

26:57.780 --> 26:59.037
Shame.

26:59.875 --> 27:02.070
Wine cellar here is surprisingly good.

27:02.116 --> 27:03.207
Pomerol.

27:03.241 --> 27:04.442
2006.

27:04.562 --> 27:05.943
Clos René.

27:07.838 --> 27:10.188
I got stopped at the border.

27:11.926 --> 27:13.651
Someone tipped them off.

27:18.670 --> 27:20.609
You think I got something to do with it?

27:21.048 --> 27:23.673
I don't blame you for
being suspicious but...

27:23.793 --> 27:25.495
we need to work together.

27:26.690 --> 27:28.899
I told you I work alone.

27:29.133 --> 27:30.633
Not on this one.

27:30.660 --> 27:31.801
Not possible.

27:33.175 --> 27:35.206
Jules, make yourself useful.

27:35.224 --> 27:37.172
Yeah, right sorry...

27:37.547 --> 27:39.632
So I was able to access

27:39.651 --> 27:42.156
the security system of the villa remotely.

27:42.522 --> 27:43.592
As it turns out,

27:43.629 --> 27:45.578
there's motion sensors around the perimeter,

27:45.605 --> 27:48.788
there's lasers inside the house,
it's all state-of-the-art stuff.

27:48.825 --> 27:50.058
Difficult to get past.

27:50.059 --> 27:51.733
Yeah, but not impossible.

27:51.734 --> 27:54.112
There are ways to temporarily
by-pass the system.

27:54.139 --> 27:55.173
I can do it.

27:55.219 --> 27:57.972
But I'll only be able
to buy you a few minutes.

27:58.722 --> 28:00.177
Frank...

28:00.616 --> 28:02.308
It's a two-man job.

28:21.659 --> 28:22.930
More wine?

28:23.689 --> 28:24.804
No.

28:24.805 --> 28:26.454
I'm going to leave.

28:27.957 --> 28:30.463
Find what you are looking for?

28:30.929 --> 28:33.454
I should've known you
wouldn't miss anything.

28:33.490 --> 28:35.191
I wish I had.

28:35.311 --> 28:37.465
If only so you could find it.

28:40.954 --> 28:43.241
It was outside the peace conference,

28:43.287 --> 28:45.080
the day she disappeared.

28:48.281 --> 28:49.616
What is it?

28:49.955 --> 28:52.113
Do you recognize this man?

28:57.289 --> 28:59.219
No, I don't. Do you?

29:00.307 --> 29:02.723
He's another transporter...

29:03.023 --> 29:04.871
Olivier Dassin.

29:13.121 --> 29:14.758
Miss Boldieu.

29:14.804 --> 29:16.642
Mr. Novik.

29:17.310 --> 29:20.907
I need you to contact Frank.
He's not picking up his phone.

29:21.124 --> 29:23.082
I wish we could.

29:23.202 --> 29:25.441
He's not answering the phone we gave him.

29:25.561 --> 29:27.279
Then contact Dassin.

29:27.399 --> 29:30.013
I'm sorry, he's not answering either.

29:30.809 --> 29:33.186
What does this have to do with Zara Knight?

29:33.800 --> 29:35.419
Zara Knight...?

29:35.539 --> 29:38.584
You used her name to get
Frank to take this job.

29:38.704 --> 29:41.328
I saw the files you
gave him on his computer.

29:41.448 --> 29:42.554
I'm sure...

29:42.590 --> 29:44.813
I don't know what you're talking about.

29:44.933 --> 29:46.404
I'm sure you do.

29:46.441 --> 29:48.361
Dassin's behind all this.

29:48.398 --> 29:51.086
He told you he needed
Frank to take that title.

29:51.571 --> 29:53.656
And what if he did?

29:54.676 --> 29:56.809
He's playing you, Mr. Novik.

29:57.265 --> 29:59.057
He's using your resources

29:59.085 --> 30:01.080
to draw Frank into a trap.

30:01.947 --> 30:03.667
Even if you're right,

30:04.179 --> 30:07.810
unfortunately there's nothing
any of us can do about it.

30:07.837 --> 30:09.273
Yes, there is.

30:09.923 --> 30:12.824
I can call the Russian
minister at the villa.

30:15.266 --> 30:17.205
You don't want to do that.

30:17.470 --> 30:19.043
Do you?

30:19.748 --> 30:21.385
Don't be so sure.

30:28.429 --> 30:29.710
Sacha,

30:29.737 --> 30:31.008
take care of it.

30:35.652 --> 30:37.005
What is it?

30:37.033 --> 30:39.283
Caterina Boldieu was just here.

30:39.329 --> 30:41.643
She's trying to reach Frank Martin.

30:41.763 --> 30:43.591
Is that why you're calling me here?

30:43.618 --> 30:47.981
She said you were involved in
Zara Knight's disappearance.

30:47.999 --> 30:49.051
So?

30:49.171 --> 30:50.332
What if I was?

30:50.452 --> 30:52.426
You never told me that.

30:52.546 --> 30:54.749
What kind of game are you playing?

30:54.767 --> 30:57.365
Mr. Novik, I'm getting
your title, as agreed.

30:57.410 --> 30:58.993
That should be your only concern.

30:59.002 --> 31:02.487
She says she's going to
alert Kunsdt you're coming.

31:02.607 --> 31:04.636
What do you want me to do about it?

31:04.756 --> 31:06.566
I'm taking care of it.

31:06.776 --> 31:09.657
You just bring back that damn title!

31:09.685 --> 31:11.642
Don't call me again until it's done.

31:24.002 --> 31:25.960
You really like cars, huh?

31:26.499 --> 31:28.603
Hell yeah. Is there anything better?

31:28.723 --> 31:30.880
Well, other than sex.

31:31.573 --> 31:33.201
Sex in cars probably.

31:35.405 --> 31:36.914
Good morning, gentlemen.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.244
Shall we get going?

31:47.179 --> 31:48.523
Thanks.

32:39.469 --> 32:41.668
So how much farther to the villa?

32:41.892 --> 32:43.127
Not far.

32:45.140 --> 32:47.555
That's really beautiful
out here, don't you think?

32:52.871 --> 32:55.679
So Frank, how long have you been driving?

32:55.880 --> 32:58.341
He's not going to answer your question.

32:59.822 --> 33:01.554
Will you, Mr. Martin?

33:04.907 --> 33:06.480
He prefers...

33:06.600 --> 33:07.960
anonymity.

33:09.827 --> 33:12.845
He wouldn't even tell his
name to people until recently.

33:13.102 --> 33:14.602
One of his rules.

33:18.596 --> 33:20.334
What about you, boss?

33:20.645 --> 33:21.926
Me?

33:22.767 --> 33:24.533
I don't believe in rules.

33:24.653 --> 33:26.270
Yeah I meant...

33:26.390 --> 33:28.584
How long you've been transporting?

33:32.746 --> 33:35.188
I lived in a small village in Egypt.

33:36.295 --> 33:38.627
One day a man showed up.

33:40.985 --> 33:42.815
And he gave me a car.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.909
He gave you a car, why?

33:46.446 --> 33:49.016
He was a drug trafficker from Columbia.

33:50.452 --> 33:52.556
He said I would drive the drugs

33:52.592 --> 33:56.086
from the desert to his boat by the sea...

33:56.479 --> 33:58.437
Or he would kill my mother,

33:58.473 --> 34:00.144
and my three sisters.

34:01.245 --> 34:02.461
Shit.

34:02.891 --> 34:03.998
So...

34:04.025 --> 34:07.282
You were like a drug
trafficker for the mafia? Wow.

34:08.333 --> 34:10.120
How long did you do that for?

34:10.135 --> 34:11.818
Quite a long time.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.686
Yeah, on the bright side,
you saved your family, right?

34:17.317 --> 34:18.542
No.

34:19.713 --> 34:21.478
He killed them anyway.

34:22.813 --> 34:24.011
Shit.

34:29.034 --> 34:30.891
What did you do?

34:31.266 --> 34:32.840
I kept driving.

34:33.389 --> 34:35.437
He said if I didn't,

34:35.474 --> 34:37.623
he'd kill me too.

34:38.108 --> 34:40.603
And one day when he wasn't looking,

34:41.327 --> 34:43.319
I ran him over with the car.

34:45.205 --> 34:47.098
And I kept driving.

34:49.659 --> 34:51.141
I'm so sorry.

34:51.261 --> 34:53.226
It was an education.

34:53.674 --> 34:57.159
It taught me the world
belongs to the merciless.

34:57.415 --> 35:00.031
The strong cannot afford pity.

36:02.671 --> 36:03.951
Dassin.

36:13.777 --> 36:16.877
There are six armed guards
around the perimeter.

36:17.381 --> 36:18.771
But only one

36:18.780 --> 36:20.013
on the west side.

36:20.033 --> 36:21.716
It's west then.

36:22.302 --> 36:23.445
Ready when you are.

36:23.811 --> 36:25.622
Just a sec.

36:26.591 --> 36:28.878
Disabling perimeter sensors.

36:28.998 --> 36:31.328
Okay, you've got six
minutes before the system

36:31.329 --> 36:33.674
- automatically resets itself.
- Shall we?

37:21.637 --> 37:24.235
We have two minutes to get in.

37:24.244 --> 37:25.717
I'll take care of him.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.949
You said to take care of him, not kill him.

37:39.995 --> 37:41.376
I took care of him.

37:42.144 --> 37:44.074
That man was just doing his job.

37:44.194 --> 37:45.940
I'm just doing mine too.

37:47.211 --> 37:49.223
Are you gonna open the door or should I?

38:11.322 --> 38:12.379
Stop.

38:12.626 --> 38:13.879
What's happening?

38:14.501 --> 38:15.360
Look.

38:53.129 --> 38:54.077
Dassin's phone.

38:54.197 --> 38:55.300
Who is this?

38:55.327 --> 38:57.641
Jules Faroux, I'm his mechanic. Who's this?

38:57.761 --> 39:00.119
I'm Caterina Boldieu, I
work with Frank Martin.

39:00.156 --> 39:01.837
How do I know you're who you say you are?

39:01.857 --> 39:03.338
How do I know you are?

39:03.375 --> 39:04.706
Just give him the phone!

39:04.907 --> 39:06.092
I can't.

39:06.110 --> 39:06.933
Why not?

39:06.979 --> 39:08.957
Cause he's not here.

39:09.077 --> 39:10.177
What?

39:10.297 --> 39:11.960
I need you to get in touch with him.

39:11.982 --> 39:13.720
- That's not possible.
- Why not?

39:13.757 --> 39:16.767
- You have to!
- Listen, I'm telling you, I can't.

39:16.887 --> 39:18.295
Why, what's the problem, anyway?

39:18.322 --> 39:19.411
Your boss...

39:19.877 --> 39:21.514
He's going to kill Frank.

39:30.358 --> 39:31.510
Listen to me, Jules.

39:31.547 --> 39:33.120
You don't sound like a murderer to me.

39:33.240 --> 39:34.775
Thanks, I guess.

39:34.895 --> 39:36.669
But I'm pretty sure your boss is.

39:36.871 --> 39:39.059
Are you sure? I really
don't think Dassin would...

39:39.068 --> 39:41.207
He lied to Frank to get him there.

39:41.208 --> 39:43.458
Why? Why would he do that?

39:43.495 --> 39:46.422
My guess? To get that
title and then kill him.

39:47.281 --> 39:48.635
Two-man job...

39:48.948 --> 39:49.852
Shit!

39:51.672 --> 39:53.730
No!

39:55.861 --> 39:57.471
I'm going to need your help.

39:57.827 --> 39:59.749
There's no way I can get a word to him.

39:59.795 --> 40:01.871
What exactly can you do then?

40:02.182 --> 40:03.956
Hold on. I've got an idea.

40:17.030 --> 40:18.860
What are you doing?

40:19.518 --> 40:21.402
Getting a message to Frank.

40:33.292 --> 40:34.367
Got it.

40:34.742 --> 40:36.773
You go with it, I'm staying.

40:36.796 --> 40:38.296
To find Kunsdt...

40:38.416 --> 40:40.614
that Russian security minister.

40:40.734 --> 40:43.586
So that you can get
answers about Zara Knight.

40:43.706 --> 40:45.827
You know whose plan this was, Frank?

40:48.279 --> 40:50.867
The Russians will pay handsomely for this.

40:51.142 --> 40:53.756
And you wouldn't have helped
if I had just asked you?

40:53.757 --> 40:54.781
No.

41:11.495 --> 41:13.107
Well, well...

41:13.125 --> 41:15.165
Olivier Dassin.

41:16.509 --> 41:19.116
Who are you working for this time?

41:21.405 --> 41:22.884
Stefan Novik.

41:22.907 --> 41:24.348
Novik?

41:27.077 --> 41:28.335
For a painting?

41:29.204 --> 41:30.915
It was inside the painting.

41:31.035 --> 41:33.503
It's title rights to mineral holdings.

41:37.688 --> 41:40.545
Our mineral holdings...

41:41.945 --> 41:43.582
Thank you, gentleman.

41:45.274 --> 41:48.301
But if you think it will save your life,

41:49.132 --> 41:50.771
you're mistaken.

41:53.185 --> 41:54.502
Shall we?

42:00.610 --> 42:02.068
Anything?

42:02.378 --> 42:03.604
Nothing.

42:03.813 --> 42:05.726
- Oh no!
- What?

42:05.745 --> 42:06.889
Wait!

42:10.311 --> 42:12.515
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

42:12.789 --> 42:14.061
Jules?

42:14.524 --> 42:16.567
This is bad. I gotta go.

43:00.349 --> 43:04.126
I didn't come here for the title.
I came here to ask you a question.

43:04.556 --> 43:06.906
The disappearance of Zara Knight.

43:07.240 --> 43:09.523
The U.N. negotiator?

43:09.643 --> 43:11.344
I was shown a document.

43:11.599 --> 43:13.812
You ordered her abduction.

43:13.840 --> 43:16.583
Like that painting you tried to steal,

43:16.593 --> 43:18.962
that must have been another forgery.

43:20.287 --> 43:21.880
Is she alive?

43:33.400 --> 43:34.917
Any ideas?

43:34.935 --> 43:36.279
I wish I had.

43:53.839 --> 43:55.220
This again?

44:12.905 --> 44:15.221
Okay, should I just come back later?

44:18.577 --> 44:21.431
Dassin, what are you doing? You're my boss!

44:21.551 --> 44:23.681
He's counting on me not shooting you.

44:24.115 --> 44:25.446
You wouldn't do that, would you?

44:25.483 --> 44:26.900
Frank wouldn't do that.

44:27.020 --> 44:28.611
Stay there!

44:32.557 --> 44:34.244
Be seeing you, Frank.

44:35.406 --> 44:36.979
Yes, you will.

44:47.438 --> 44:49.242
Son-of-a-bitch!

44:57.882 --> 44:59.749
I need to see Mr. Novik.

45:00.250 --> 45:02.327
I'm sorry. He's not available.

45:05.922 --> 45:07.271
The title?

45:07.491 --> 45:08.725
Did you get it?

45:09.092 --> 45:10.152
No.

45:10.727 --> 45:13.454
You double-crossed me!

45:16.833 --> 45:18.950
You have ruined me!

45:19.070 --> 45:20.240
I didn't.

45:20.286 --> 45:21.996
Frank Martin did.

45:22.637 --> 45:24.137
Is he still alive?

45:24.257 --> 45:25.426
Yes.

45:25.546 --> 45:26.990
Then this isn't over.

45:27.311 --> 45:28.692
It is for you.

45:32.983 --> 45:34.522
Maybe you didn't hear me.

45:34.550 --> 45:35.940
I need to see him now.

46:14.221 --> 46:15.548
Thanks.

46:16.690 --> 46:17.705
Hey.

46:18.225 --> 46:19.362
Hey.

46:20.177 --> 46:22.162
At least Novik's passports worked.

46:22.464 --> 46:23.854
Here you go.

46:23.863 --> 46:24.887
Cheers.

46:38.809 --> 46:39.660
Yeah?

46:39.696 --> 46:41.114
Good to hear your voice.

46:42.349 --> 46:43.931
Novik's dead.

46:45.093 --> 46:46.987
Dassin had him killed.

46:47.107 --> 46:48.606
Right.

46:48.642 --> 46:51.942
And I have information about
Zara Knight's disappearance.

46:51.943 --> 46:55.236
The Minister wasn't involved
in the disappearance of Zara.

46:55.282 --> 46:56.453
Dassin was.

46:57.108 --> 46:58.618
What are you talking about?

46:58.738 --> 47:01.087
I saw a photo in the police files.

47:01.207 --> 47:04.445
He was there at the conference
the day she disappeared.

47:05.131 --> 47:07.088
Frank, are you okay?

47:07.353 --> 47:08.808
Are you all right?

47:12.228 --> 47:14.130
Yeah, I'm fine.
