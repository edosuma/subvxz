WEBVTT

00:00.036 --> 00:01.555
Previously on The Fosters...

00:02.070 --> 00:03.703
Hey, I watched the live-stream earlier.

00:03.739 --> 00:04.816
What the hell were you doing?

00:04.840 --> 00:06.606
- Playing the game.
- Really?

00:06.641 --> 00:08.875
I couldn't tell there with
all the flirting with Declan.

00:08.910 --> 00:11.344
I did have those feelings for you.

00:11.379 --> 00:14.480
- What if I'm gay?
- You need to be honest with yourself, Tess,

00:14.515 --> 00:16.047
and with your husband.

00:16.084 --> 00:18.684
Her father is completely unreliable.

00:18.719 --> 00:22.288
He's got a new family of his
own, and we have no help here.

00:22.323 --> 00:25.291
We might have to talk
about what friends do.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.326
- What? Friends don't hold hands?
- No.

00:27.362 --> 00:29.495
You used to do that all the
time when we were married,

00:29.530 --> 00:31.875
you'd forget to breathe. It used
to scare the bejesus out of me.

00:31.899 --> 00:35.501
- Hold me.
- Okay. Okay, come here.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.904
I am granting a stay of deportation

00:38.939 --> 00:43.074
until Ms. Sinfuego's
DACA status is decided.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.919
Oh damn. She was coming in hot.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.520
Even hotter than usual.

00:56.689 --> 00:58.957
Closing in. You holding
your position, Taylor?

00:58.992 --> 01:00.325
Locking it down.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.427
Hey, Jude, what's
your favorite position?

01:02.462 --> 01:05.229
Like he'd know. Jude's like olive oil...

01:05.263 --> 01:07.097
extra virgin.

01:09.268 --> 01:11.101
So, sometimes I kinda like to perch

01:11.137 --> 01:13.571
of the shielded skulls
in the Elderworld Dungeon.

01:13.606 --> 01:15.973
In the dungeon? Mmm.

01:16.008 --> 01:17.902
- That's freaky.
- I mean, it is the best place

01:17.903 --> 01:19.043
to pick off Krone Elves.

01:20.846 --> 01:23.180
All right. Guess that's
it for today, guys.

01:23.215 --> 01:24.748
We're Two Gay Guys and a Girl.

01:24.783 --> 01:26.216
Hope you'll catch us next time.

01:27.553 --> 01:30.287
But I doubt anyone will
after how lame that was.

01:35.327 --> 01:39.429
Umm, my mom's here, so... later.

01:44.302 --> 01:46.870
Dude, what the hell was that?

01:46.905 --> 01:50.739
- Were you trying to put everyone to sleep?
- I'm sorry.

01:50.775 --> 01:54.577
But I can't be all
flirty like that anymore.

01:54.612 --> 01:56.312
Noah got mad at me.

01:56.348 --> 01:58.147
Why?

01:58.183 --> 02:01.050
It... it's just an act for
the fans. It's not real.

02:01.086 --> 02:03.953
Yeah, I know that.

02:03.989 --> 02:06.789
Dude, we gotta give
the fans what they want,

02:06.824 --> 02:09.925
'cause if we do, then
we get what we want...

02:11.395 --> 02:13.996
- like these.
- Whoa. Where'd you get those?

02:14.031 --> 02:16.398
A fan sent us both a pair.

02:16.433 --> 02:18.433
I get free shit like this all the time,

02:18.469 --> 02:20.335
and now so will you...

02:20.371 --> 02:22.004
if you keep playing along.

02:22.039 --> 02:24.706
If you get all serious and
boring, we're gonna lose viewers,

02:24.741 --> 02:26.574
and Eminent Power's gonna drop us.

02:28.112 --> 02:31.179
So, talk to your boyfriend.
He needs to chill.

02:37.321 --> 02:39.354
- What is this?
- What?

02:41.758 --> 02:46.127
Oh, it's, um, uh, a mild
sedative for anxiety.

02:47.263 --> 02:49.764
Went to the gynecologist
today for a checkup.

02:49.799 --> 02:53.401
- And?
- And told her...

02:53.436 --> 02:54.969
what's... what's been going on,

02:55.005 --> 02:57.738
and since I don't have a history
of anxiety or depression...

02:59.542 --> 03:03.144
she thinks that I may be in
perimenopause. Yay for me.

03:04.914 --> 03:07.248
Which, you know, hormones
can be all fluctuating

03:07.283 --> 03:10.317
and there's lots of side
effects, one of which is anxiety.

03:11.754 --> 03:14.454
Okay, well, what about...
what about therapy?

03:14.489 --> 03:16.289
Did you reschedule your appointment?

03:16.324 --> 03:18.926
Uh, what's the point
if it's physiological?

03:18.961 --> 03:20.794
Therapy's not gonna help.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:31.906 --> 03:33.773
- What do you want?
- I need to talk to you.

03:34.776 --> 03:36.742
I've nothing to say to you.

03:38.513 --> 03:40.046
I want to apologize.

03:43.085 --> 03:45.552
We were told that Ximena
made threatening remarks

03:45.587 --> 03:47.319
at the protest, radical stuff...

03:47.354 --> 03:49.655
you know, calling for
violence, that kinda thing.

03:49.691 --> 03:51.401
It wasn't until I saw
the video of her speech

03:51.425 --> 03:53.859
at the hearing that I
realized we'd been lied to.

03:53.895 --> 03:56.495
- She never should've been targeted.
- What about her parents?

03:56.530 --> 03:59.665
- 'Cause they were targeted too.
- I wasn't involved in detaining them.

03:59.701 --> 04:02.082
Well, her family's
basically been destroyed, so

04:02.083 --> 04:03.563
just keep telling yourself that.

04:04.805 --> 04:07.172
Look, just so you know,
I didn't get into this

04:07.208 --> 04:09.708
to chase innocent
teenagers into churches.

04:09.743 --> 04:13.245
You know, I thought I was
making this country safer.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.547
The things at ICE have changed,

04:15.583 --> 04:17.223
agents are being given
carte Blanche to go

04:17.250 --> 04:19.784
after whoever they
want however they want.

04:19.820 --> 04:21.219
It's not right.

04:24.825 --> 04:26.691
So, what are you gonna do about it?

04:28.161 --> 04:30.729
- 'Cause frankly, an apology doesn't cut it.
- I know.

04:32.265 --> 04:34.398
That's why I've got some
information I wanna give you.

05:08.832 --> 05:13.832
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:17.642 --> 05:20.810
So, apparently ICE has
a new mandate to go after

05:20.845 --> 05:22.712
undocumented kids who
have just turned 18,

05:22.747 --> 05:24.181
so they can legally detain them.

05:24.216 --> 05:26.282
- Why?
- To fill quotas.

05:26.317 --> 05:28.785
- Gross.
- Anyway, they're planning a raid

05:28.820 --> 05:30.998
at a high school this week.
We don't know where or when,

05:31.022 --> 05:33.656
but he said he's gonna give us
a heads-up when he knows more.

05:33.692 --> 05:35.958
- What does he want us to do?
- Record it.

05:35.994 --> 05:38.828
He wants us to expose
everything that's going on.

05:38.863 --> 05:41.030
Okay, so, what? We're just gonna go

05:41.066 --> 05:43.232
and record kids getting detained?

05:43.267 --> 05:44.900
Getting their lives ruined?

05:44.935 --> 05:46.302
Look, we have to help them.

05:46.337 --> 05:48.170
At the very least, we have to warn them.

05:50.608 --> 05:52.107
Good point.

05:52.142 --> 05:57.045
Okay. So, can we...
like, get in trouble...

05:58.148 --> 05:59.981
if we tell them that ICE is coming?

06:01.218 --> 06:03.063
I don't think so. As long
as you don't actually,

06:03.087 --> 06:05.120
like, obstruct justice.

06:05.155 --> 06:06.955
Okay. Good.

06:06.990 --> 06:08.690
Ximena, you just got your stay.

06:08.726 --> 06:11.359
You can't risk being a part of this.

06:11.394 --> 06:12.794
But we can.

06:14.164 --> 06:15.530
I wanna come too.

06:17.867 --> 06:19.601
Okay, I'm late for a study group.

06:19.636 --> 06:21.135
I'll talk to you guys later.

06:25.775 --> 06:28.209
Low-key, Aaron's way
cooler than I thought.

06:28.245 --> 06:32.379
So, are you guys still just friends?

06:33.449 --> 06:35.983
- Yeah.
- What are you waiting for?

06:36.018 --> 06:38.585
Yeah. You think you guys
are gonna get back together?

06:40.890 --> 06:43.423
I don't know.

06:43.459 --> 06:45.297
So, your white blood
cell count came back,

06:45.298 --> 06:46.426
and you're clear of infection,

06:46.462 --> 06:49.763
so you're ready to have
your "T" cells put back in.

06:49.798 --> 06:52.899
Now, as we discussed, the new
cells also attack healthy cells,

06:52.934 --> 06:54.434
which may affect your immune system,

06:54.470 --> 06:56.870
so we're gonna keep a close
eye on you after the procedure.

06:58.440 --> 07:01.408
So, if this doesn't work,
will her immune system

07:01.443 --> 07:03.843
be too compromised to
try other treatments?

07:03.879 --> 07:05.745
Or will she able to go back to chemo?

07:05.781 --> 07:08.181
Mom, can we please give this a chance

07:08.216 --> 07:09.682
before talking worst-case scenarios?

07:09.717 --> 07:11.384
- I am. I'm just...
- Hey.

07:15.356 --> 07:18.758
- Uh, hi, Dad.
- What are you doing here?

07:18.794 --> 07:21.360
Excuse me.

07:22.797 --> 07:25.097
I wanted to be here
for Grace's procedure.

07:25.132 --> 07:27.533
Well, a little heads-up
would've been nice.

07:27.568 --> 07:29.935
Yeah, I don't need your permission.

07:32.106 --> 07:33.906
Hey. So...

07:35.510 --> 07:36.510
You ready for this?

07:38.112 --> 07:39.845
As ready as I'll ever be.

07:42.883 --> 07:44.516
Hi. I'm... I'm Brandon.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.451
- Grace's... boyfriend.
- Sorry.

07:47.454 --> 07:48.454
Hi.

07:49.456 --> 07:51.123
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

08:07.453 --> 08:08.519
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:08.554 --> 08:09.987
Just wanted to return this to you,

08:10.023 --> 08:12.089
so... thanks.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.059
You wanna come in?

08:19.899 --> 08:20.998
Everything okay?

08:23.001 --> 08:24.267
Umm...

08:26.138 --> 08:28.071
Tess asked me for a separation.

08:31.544 --> 08:34.910
- I'm sorry, Dean. I'm...
- I mean, I... I... I love her,

08:34.947 --> 08:38.148
and I can't imagine
my life without her...

08:38.183 --> 08:39.850
without Logan.

08:42.687 --> 08:44.087
Why... why would she do this?

08:46.591 --> 08:48.124
Wha... what'd she say?

08:49.328 --> 08:52.495
Just that she's not happy...

08:52.530 --> 08:54.597
and needs some time
apart to figure out why.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.836
Did she say anything to you?

09:02.741 --> 09:05.085
- I, uh...
- I'm sorry. I don't mean to put you in the middle.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.442
No, no, no, no. Not at all.

09:06.478 --> 09:08.778
I just... I just want
to say that I'm... I'm...

09:10.147 --> 09:14.483
I really hope that you guys
can work this out. I do.

09:14.518 --> 09:18.053
I hoped that moving back to San
Diego would make things better.

09:21.058 --> 09:22.657
I guess not.

09:28.766 --> 09:32.166
Hey. Nurse is in there with Grace.

09:33.303 --> 09:35.637
Susan is... somewhere.

09:35.672 --> 09:38.774
Probably plotting my demise.

09:40.944 --> 09:44.045
So, Grace tells me that...
that you play piano.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.447
- I'm a musician, too.
- Oh yeah? What do you play?

09:46.482 --> 09:49.918
I'm a saxophonist. I
haven't played much lately,

09:49.953 --> 09:52.186
not since Grace was little, really.

09:52.222 --> 09:54.155
We used to have our own band.

09:54.190 --> 09:55.823
The Dew Drops.

09:56.826 --> 09:58.626
And we... we played many a gig

09:58.661 --> 10:00.621
to sold-out crowds of stuffed animals.

10:01.964 --> 10:05.265
Yeah, Grace and I are sort of in a band.

10:05.301 --> 10:07.234
Oh yeah? What are you guys called?

10:07.269 --> 10:09.069
Grandon Canyon.

10:10.640 --> 10:14.174
I told her we have to keep
working on the name, but...

10:14.209 --> 10:16.811
- Have you guys played anywhere?
- Uh, no, not really.

10:16.846 --> 10:19.947
- Just a bagel shop.
- Ah.

10:19.982 --> 10:22.950
- I'm sorry I missed it.
- Well, you have to come to the next one.

10:22.985 --> 10:26.286
Yeah, I don't know. I'm not so
sure Grace would want me there.

10:27.456 --> 10:28.555
You can go back in now.

10:28.590 --> 10:29.689
I'm gonna...

10:31.260 --> 10:33.427
you know, hit the
restroom. Why don't you...

10:38.934 --> 10:40.633
Hey. Everything okay?

10:40.669 --> 10:42.101
Oh my gosh. Thank God you're here.

10:43.371 --> 10:46.973
It's been crazy intense.
Please do not leave me with him.

10:47.008 --> 10:48.608
All right. I promise I won't.

10:51.779 --> 10:55.581
So, the Dew Drops, huh?

10:55.616 --> 10:58.150
Please tell me there's video
footage of that somewhere.

10:59.420 --> 11:02.654
My poor dad. It was basically
me just holding him hostage

11:02.690 --> 11:04.957
for hours as we played.

11:06.894 --> 11:08.426
God, he was so sweet.

11:08.462 --> 11:11.396
Yeah, he seems like
a good... a good guy.

11:12.399 --> 11:14.065
Yup, he is.

11:15.435 --> 11:17.903
So... why don't you like...

11:19.773 --> 11:21.773
have a relationship with him?

11:25.078 --> 11:27.812
It's kinda complicated.

11:27.847 --> 11:31.716
When I got sick the
second time, my mom...

11:33.153 --> 11:36.587
got really stressed out and
controlling over everything.

11:36.623 --> 11:39.424
I mean, you know how she can be.

11:42.662 --> 11:44.055
I don't know. I just think over time

11:44.056 --> 11:46.696
my dad just couldn't take it anymore.

11:48.968 --> 11:50.668
So he... left?

11:50.703 --> 11:51.903
Mm-hmm.

11:54.807 --> 11:56.974
My mom was devastated.

11:58.444 --> 11:59.676
And I felt like I...

12:00.712 --> 12:02.846
I couldn't...

12:02.881 --> 12:04.465
I felt like if I saw a lot of my dad,

12:04.466 --> 12:06.917
it might seem like I
was taking his side.

12:06.952 --> 12:08.785
Or something and I...

12:10.489 --> 12:14.024
- Did he leave?
- Uh, he went to the bathroom.

12:15.627 --> 12:17.761
I'm surprised he ever came back at all.

12:17.796 --> 12:19.996
Henry never could deal with any of this.

12:20.032 --> 12:22.899
and now... he wants to be a father.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.835
Declan thinks if we don't
keep up the flirting,

12:29.836 --> 12:30.836
then no one's gonna watch,

12:30.841 --> 12:32.608
and then Eminent Power will drop us.

12:33.778 --> 12:37.213
Okay, then why don't
you just talk to Noah,

12:37.248 --> 12:41.050
and tell him you're, like,
in character or whatever.

12:41.086 --> 12:43.152
You really think he's gonna
buy that coming from me?

12:43.188 --> 12:46.855
I mean, maybe if he heard
it from someone else.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.425
- You want me to talk to him?
- You guys are friends,

12:50.461 --> 12:52.861
- and he trusts you.
- Well, he should trust you.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.898
I know, but... he doesn't get gaming

12:55.933 --> 12:58.067
or how we're supposed
to keep our fans happy.

12:59.236 --> 13:01.503
And... I don't want this to go away...

13:01.538 --> 13:04.038
for any of us.

13:04.074 --> 13:08.210
And I mean, I am kinda getting
used to making all that money.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.448
Okay.

13:51.887 --> 13:54.387
Wow, 62 in Marin today.

13:54.422 --> 13:55.822
I'll alert the media.

13:59.494 --> 14:02.228
So, what exactly are we waiting for?

14:03.966 --> 14:05.565
We're always waiting, Henry...

14:05.600 --> 14:09.402
doctors, tests, treatment rooms.

14:09.437 --> 14:11.638
Nothing moves fast in a hospital.

14:16.178 --> 14:17.577
So, how's... how's Jada?

14:17.612 --> 14:19.823
Oh, she just had her violin recital.

14:19.847 --> 14:21.981
She reminds me so much of you

14:22.016 --> 14:23.516
- at that age.
- _

14:23.552 --> 14:26.285
You know that she really wanted
to come see her big sister,

14:26.320 --> 14:29.288
- but she has school.
- Yeah, we text a lot.

14:29.323 --> 14:31.824
Jada is Henry's daughter
with his current wife.

14:31.859 --> 14:34.927
She was so excited about
getting her ears pierced.

14:34.962 --> 14:37.629
Her mother wasn't.

14:37.665 --> 14:40.700
She was pretty angry when I
brought Jada home from the mall.

14:40.735 --> 14:43.168
She wanted them pierced so
bad, I didn't know what to say.

14:43.204 --> 14:45.036
"No" is always an option.

14:47.007 --> 14:49.841
You can't always say
"No" to everything, Susan.

14:49.876 --> 14:52.844
No, I think you have to give your
kids some say in their lives, or...

14:54.615 --> 14:57.382
as soon as they're old enough,
they'll move away from you.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.189
_

15:08.461 --> 15:11.696
I'm... I'm sorry. I have to call my mom.

15:14.434 --> 15:17.134
- Hey.
- Hey. I'm at the hospital. What's going on?

15:17.169 --> 15:20.271
I, uh... I need you to
come pick me up, please.

15:20.306 --> 15:21.772
- When?
- Right now.

15:21.807 --> 15:23.907
I'm at the... the market on 3rd.

15:23.943 --> 15:26.344
I... I don't think that I can drive.

15:26.379 --> 15:29.413
- Why not? What... what's going on?
- I can't!

15:29.449 --> 15:32.582
- Please come pick me up.
- Okay. Okay.

15:32.618 --> 15:34.118
I'm on my way now.

15:50.900 --> 15:53.000
- Thanks, B.
- Yeah.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.336
I don't know what happened.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.091
I've never felt like that before.

16:00.308 --> 16:01.742
You don't remember that...

16:02.845 --> 16:05.579
that time that Dad and I
had to get you at the bank?

16:05.614 --> 16:07.080
I was like five at the time.

16:07.115 --> 16:08.882
It was right before you guys split up.

16:11.420 --> 16:14.821
Dad told me that you
weren't feeling well that day

16:14.857 --> 16:16.756
and that we needed to drive you home.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.463
I... I'm sorry.

16:23.498 --> 16:26.190
I... I... I... I'm sure
the last thing you need

16:26.191 --> 16:27.500
is another person to take care of.

16:27.536 --> 16:29.769
Go... go back to the
hospital if you want.

16:29.804 --> 16:31.438
I will be just fine.

16:33.675 --> 16:35.507
Umm... it's okay.

16:37.745 --> 16:39.979
I'm here as long as you need me.

16:42.283 --> 16:43.616
Thanks, bud.

16:58.799 --> 17:00.532
- Can I see?
- No.

17:01.635 --> 17:03.001
Why not?

17:03.036 --> 17:04.435
It's not...

17:05.806 --> 17:06.972
Yeah, it's embarrassing.

17:07.007 --> 17:09.941
You're embarrassed?
I'm the one half-naked.

17:09.977 --> 17:11.835
- Yeah, but you look hot.
- Pfft! Well,

17:11.836 --> 17:13.377
I am more than just a
pretty face, you know?

17:13.413 --> 17:17.281
Yeah, I am well aware of that.

17:17.317 --> 17:18.650
Hmm.

17:20.185 --> 17:22.953
No, I... I don't want
you to be offended,

17:22.989 --> 17:26.857
'cause I made you look so weird.

17:26.892 --> 17:30.761
Look, I will not be
offended. Come on, trust me.

17:32.265 --> 17:35.933
Okay, I've never drawn
anyone's portrait before.

17:35.968 --> 17:37.668
Oh, so I'm your first?

17:43.943 --> 17:44.943
Come on.

17:52.985 --> 17:55.519
Uh, this is... it's terrible.

17:57.523 --> 18:01.358
- I'm kidding.
- Oh, I hate you!

18:01.393 --> 18:04.561
- That is so messed up!
- Oh, come on. I had to do it.

18:04.596 --> 18:06.763
Wow.

18:06.798 --> 18:09.232
No, it's...

18:10.435 --> 18:13.369
- It's really, really good.
- I don't believe you.

18:13.404 --> 18:15.571
You're a talented artist.

18:15.606 --> 18:17.206
Stop selling yourself short.

18:19.711 --> 18:21.711
So, you're saying it's not terrible?

18:24.916 --> 18:25.948
What?

18:27.318 --> 18:29.285
I mean, you didn't draw my scars.

18:31.155 --> 18:34.323
- Yeah, I... I didn't know...
- How I feel about 'em?

18:35.993 --> 18:39.295
Well, I'm not ashamed
of them or anything.

18:40.298 --> 18:41.298
I mean...

18:42.300 --> 18:44.332
I finally love my body.

18:46.770 --> 18:48.070
Yeah, me too.

18:52.710 --> 18:57.545
How... do you feel
about... people seeing this?

18:58.582 --> 19:00.182
Like, if I do put them in...

19:00.217 --> 19:03.084
you know, I don't wanna... out you.

19:05.888 --> 19:07.021
Can I think about it?

19:08.458 --> 19:10.692
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

19:13.697 --> 19:16.231
Jude, you were supposed
to fold these, honey.

19:19.602 --> 19:20.602
Hey.

19:20.636 --> 19:23.104
What?

19:23.139 --> 19:25.272
- Where'd you get these?
- Uh, a fan.

19:27.243 --> 19:28.909
You gave out our address?

19:28.945 --> 19:32.679
- No, they sent them to Declan.
- So, Declan is giving out his address?

19:32.715 --> 19:35.315
Mom, we're not stupid. He
uses this wish-list site

19:35.351 --> 19:36.434
that lets fans buy you stuff,

19:36.435 --> 19:37.962
but blocks 'em from
seeing where it gets sent.

19:37.986 --> 19:40.754
Okay, why are people buying
you stuff in the first place?

19:40.789 --> 19:42.989
Jude, we talked about boundaries

19:43.024 --> 19:44.658
when we first agreed to let you do this.

19:44.693 --> 19:46.260
I don't think it's appropriate for kids

19:46.295 --> 19:48.562
to be spending their
money buying you gifts.

19:48.597 --> 19:50.596
It's not just kids. It's adults too.

19:50.632 --> 19:52.932
- That's even worse, Jude!
- And... and companies.

19:52.968 --> 19:55.135
People who want to
advertise their products.

19:55.170 --> 19:58.304
- All influencers do it.
- You are not an influencer!

19:58.339 --> 19:59.461
You're not doing it!

19:59.462 --> 20:02.708
And you need to tell everyone
that watches your show

20:02.744 --> 20:05.178
to stop sending you things.

20:05.213 --> 20:08.547
Those headphones are going back
to whomever sent them to you.

20:08.583 --> 20:11.116
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously!

20:11.152 --> 20:14.052
You cannot imagine what
I see at work, young man,

20:14.088 --> 20:16.489
and half of it starts
with online predators!

20:16.524 --> 20:19.158
Jude, your safety and your
privacy are non-negotiable.

20:19.193 --> 20:21.961
And I want access to your
chats and your messages,

20:21.962 --> 20:23.328
or whatever... all that stuff.

20:23.363 --> 20:25.264
And no giving out private
information online.

20:25.299 --> 20:27.332
- Okay, I got it. Jeez.
- Hey.

20:29.536 --> 20:30.568
Sorry.

20:33.307 --> 20:35.540
- Can I please go now?
- Yes, you may.

20:40.980 --> 20:43.315
Okay. We need to start some dinner.

20:44.318 --> 20:46.785
Uh, we... we don't have anything.

20:46.820 --> 20:48.453
I thought you went to the grocery store.

20:48.488 --> 20:51.356
I... I... I did not have time.

20:54.628 --> 20:57.628
Okay. No worries. We'll
just order something.

21:14.046 --> 21:15.779
- Hello?
- Callie?

21:15.815 --> 21:17.948
- Yeah.
- There's gonna be a raid this morning,

21:17.983 --> 21:19.683
Central High on Orange and Bedford.

21:19.719 --> 21:21.418
The targets are three undocumented kids.

21:22.755 --> 21:25.489
Okay. Um, what are their na...

21:29.394 --> 21:32.795
Mariana. Mariana, get up. We gotta go.

21:32.831 --> 21:35.031
- Mariana, there's gonna be a raid.
- When?

21:35.067 --> 21:36.499
Right now.

21:46.110 --> 21:47.610
- IDs?
- We don't go here.

21:47.645 --> 21:50.446
- We need to talk to your principal, like now.
- Excuse me?

21:50.482 --> 21:52.715
Immigration is planning
a raid here any minute.

21:52.751 --> 21:55.818
Please. Come on. It's an emergency.

21:55.854 --> 21:58.488
I need Principal De
Los Reyes to the front.

21:58.523 --> 22:00.835
Is there a way that we can get on
the PA and make an announcement?

22:00.859 --> 22:02.836
- You gotta talk to the principal.
- We're losing time.

22:02.860 --> 22:05.960
Okay, spread out. We need to warn
as many students as possible, okay?

22:05.996 --> 22:07.962
If you know anyone that is undocumented,

22:07.998 --> 22:10.098
please tell them that it
is not safe to be here.

22:10.133 --> 22:11.244
ICE is on their way.

22:11.268 --> 22:14.002
This is not a joke, okay?
This is happening, for real.

22:14.037 --> 22:17.338
Tell everyone you can. Immigration
is targeting your school!

22:17.374 --> 22:19.908
ICE doesn't come to the schools.

22:24.614 --> 22:26.948
- The buses.
- They're not on school property.

22:26.983 --> 22:28.049
Go, go, go.

22:31.054 --> 22:32.353
If you're not documented,

22:32.389 --> 22:34.100
- you are not safe!
- If you're undocumented,

22:34.124 --> 22:36.357
they're going to target you! Get inside!

22:36.393 --> 22:38.437
If you're undocumented,
you are not safe here.

22:38.461 --> 22:40.528
Get inside!

22:40.563 --> 22:42.863
Shit. Anyone undocumented needs to run.

22:42.899 --> 22:44.231
I'm gonna go warn the other bus.

22:44.266 --> 22:47.768
- Immigration is here!
- Go, get inside!

22:47.804 --> 22:50.871
Let everyone know if you're
undocumented, it's not safe!

22:50.907 --> 22:54.007
- If you're undocumented, they're going to target you!
- Hey, stop!

22:55.411 --> 22:57.710
- Hey!
- Cooperate or you're gonna make it worse.

22:57.746 --> 22:59.579
I didn't do anything wrong!

22:59.614 --> 23:00.690
Lee Park, you are in violation

23:00.691 --> 23:03.383
of Section 1325 in Title 8
of the United States Code.

23:03.518 --> 23:05.885
If any of you are undocumented,
you need to leave now.

23:05.921 --> 23:07.665
Why are you doing this?
Okay, what's he done?

23:07.689 --> 23:09.289
Let me go! I just want to go to school!

23:09.325 --> 23:11.558
- Help me, please.
- Don't say anything, okay?

23:11.593 --> 23:14.226
And don't sign anything
until you talked to a lawyer!

23:14.262 --> 23:15.394
Go, go.

23:16.598 --> 23:19.499
Randy Dominguez, stop
right there! Hey, stop!

23:19.534 --> 23:21.000
Run, Randy!

23:25.874 --> 23:27.117
Put your hands behind your back.

23:27.141 --> 23:28.674
What? What? What did I do?

23:28.709 --> 23:31.221
- Someone help him!
- You're under arrest for obstruction of justice.

23:31.245 --> 23:33.612
I didn't do anything.
Someone shoved me into you.

23:34.615 --> 23:36.815
What are you doing?
You can't arrest him!

23:36.851 --> 23:39.485
Stand back now, or
you'll be detained too.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.687
Call Michael Smith at the
Juvenile Justice Center.

23:41.722 --> 23:43.655
Tell him what happened. Hurry!

23:51.765 --> 23:54.125
This is a message for Michael Smith.

23:54.193 --> 23:57.227
It's Callie again. I just wanted to see

23:57.262 --> 24:00.663
if you have an update on Aaron Baker.

24:00.699 --> 24:02.097
Please call me back.

24:10.908 --> 24:13.008
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

24:13.044 --> 24:14.944
Oh my God. Where are you?

24:14.979 --> 24:17.746
I'm in a holding cell downtown.

24:17.781 --> 24:20.682
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, um,

24:20.718 --> 24:24.286
but... I gotta get outta
here before I get processed.

24:26.190 --> 24:27.790
They're gonna strip-search me.

24:27.926 --> 24:30.143
Have you heard from anyone at the JJC?

24:30.628 --> 24:34.196
No. They said it might be a while
before anyone gets in to see me.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.434
I won't be safe in Central Jail...

24:39.470 --> 24:41.903
if people find out.

24:47.211 --> 24:50.111
You know, Grace's procedure
won't be done for a while.

24:50.146 --> 24:51.813
Don't you have school?

24:51.848 --> 24:55.516
Yeah, but I got permission. I
wanna be here when she gets back.

24:57.220 --> 25:00.388
Hi. Hey, so I was just
talking to Grace's doctor,

25:00.423 --> 25:02.282
and she says that if this
initial treatment doesn't work,

25:02.310 --> 25:03.754
a second round of gene
therapy would actually

25:03.755 --> 25:05.438
be a better option than chemo.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.128
Why were you talking to Grace's doctor?

25:07.163 --> 25:08.222
Uh, because I'm her father,

25:08.223 --> 25:10.752
- and I have every right to be involved.
- Don't get ahead of yourself.

25:10.753 --> 25:13.130
Where were you the last
time Grace's cancer relapsed?

25:13.170 --> 25:15.481
- You didn't get involved then.
- Yeah, because you didn't want me there.

25:15.505 --> 25:17.425
Because you were having
an affair with the nurse.

25:20.743 --> 25:22.876
When are you gonna
quit rehashing the past?

25:22.912 --> 25:25.413
- That is easy for you to say.
- You need to get a life, Susan.

25:26.982 --> 25:30.484
Stop using your daughter as an
excuse for why you haven't moved on.

25:40.389 --> 25:41.421
Hey.

25:42.424 --> 25:43.424
Hey.

25:45.694 --> 25:49.128
- So, I talked to Taylor.
- And?

25:49.163 --> 25:52.265
Well, for one, I really wish you
would've talked to me yourself.

25:53.935 --> 25:55.935
I knew how pissed you
were about the shippers.

25:57.205 --> 25:58.404
I didn't think you'd listen.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.240
It's not the shippers
I was pissed about.

26:02.110 --> 26:04.176
I know you're not exactly
Declan's biggest fan,

26:04.212 --> 26:07.446
but you've seen the douche
bags that rule the gaming world.

26:07.481 --> 26:10.516
I mean, don't the gay gamers
deserve some good role models?

26:18.058 --> 26:21.727
- What are you doing?
- Remember when you first came to youth group?

26:21.762 --> 26:23.529
We did that trust exercise?

26:26.300 --> 26:28.333
The first time we held hands.

26:28.368 --> 26:30.135
Yours were so...

26:31.638 --> 26:33.338
sweaty.

26:35.708 --> 26:39.577
If all these gamers need
somebody to look up to...

26:42.049 --> 26:44.015
I think it should be you.

26:44.051 --> 26:46.584
As long as the flirting
is only on-screen,

26:46.619 --> 26:48.786
I'm cool with it. I trust you.

26:50.457 --> 26:52.256
You're the best.

26:52.291 --> 26:54.459
I know, right?

27:02.401 --> 27:06.155
Please don't tell Grace
about Henry's affair.

27:07.054 --> 27:12.091
I never told her. I didn't want it
to ruin her opinion of her father.

27:13.449 --> 27:15.415
That's big of you.

27:17.686 --> 27:20.987
You know my mom and
dad are divorced, right?

27:21.022 --> 27:24.390
- Yeah.
- Since I was, like, five.

27:24.426 --> 27:26.225
I mean, for a long time

27:26.261 --> 27:27.981
I felt really stuck in
the middle, you know?

27:29.297 --> 27:32.832
It would've been... awful
if they made me choose sides.

27:34.269 --> 27:38.070
Wait a minute. I have never
asked Grace to choose sides.

27:39.340 --> 27:41.907
Okay, maybe not, but...

27:43.243 --> 27:47.212
I... I think she sees how hurt you were

27:47.247 --> 27:49.815
how hurt you are, honestly.

27:50.818 --> 27:53.018
And I just don't think she wanted to...

27:54.355 --> 27:55.887
do anything to add to that.

27:58.625 --> 27:59.791
Did she tell you that?

28:01.895 --> 28:03.428
She didn't have to.

28:13.015 --> 28:15.416
- Let me... let me help you.
- No, stop.

28:15.451 --> 28:17.451
If you guys could keep
your eyes on the screen,

28:17.486 --> 28:20.054
and off each other, we'd
be kicking way more ass.

28:20.089 --> 28:23.223
Oh please. I'm basically carrying
noob and noobette over here.

28:23.259 --> 28:24.991
Just check my power ranking.

28:25.027 --> 28:26.493
I just hit that Charzander

28:26.529 --> 28:28.862
harder than Declan wants to hit this.

28:28.897 --> 28:30.797
Jude with the clapback.

28:30.832 --> 28:32.265
Yeah, you wish.

28:34.603 --> 28:36.836
And... boom!

28:36.872 --> 28:39.940
All right. I... I guess
that's it for today, guys.

28:39.975 --> 28:42.341
Stream with us next
time for more of this.

28:42.377 --> 28:44.910
I know you guys can't resist.

28:44.946 --> 28:47.012
That was awesome.

28:47.048 --> 28:49.982
Dude, we just kicked, like, so much ass.

28:50.017 --> 28:52.818
We're basically Eminent
Power's GOAT, like, really.

28:54.655 --> 28:56.355
"Greatest Of All Time"?

28:57.758 --> 28:59.559
You are so cute when you're clueless.

29:02.029 --> 29:03.029
All right, man.

29:04.065 --> 29:06.131
- Well, I'll see you later?
- Yeah.

29:16.577 --> 29:18.477
- What?
- Come on, Jude.

29:18.512 --> 29:21.679
I convinced Noah that there was
nothing going on between you two,

29:21.715 --> 29:23.482
and that's clearly not what's up.

29:24.618 --> 29:25.883
Declan's into you.

29:25.919 --> 29:28.953
Well, I'm not into him,
so what does it matter?

29:30.324 --> 29:35.559
Oh, hey, I forgot. A
fan sent these for you.

29:35.595 --> 29:38.562
- For real?
- Yeah. Everyone loves the show the way it is,

29:38.598 --> 29:40.264
so better not screw it up, right?

29:53.746 --> 29:55.879
Aaron.

29:57.416 --> 29:58.849
Hey.

29:58.884 --> 30:01.318
So... Callie talk to you?

30:01.354 --> 30:03.387
Yeah, she's very worried about you.

30:03.422 --> 30:06.023
I want you to know that I've
spoken with your lawyers.

30:06.058 --> 30:07.824
And they're doing everything they can.

30:07.860 --> 30:09.420
So then why am I still here?

30:10.495 --> 30:12.529
Because you're being booked.

30:12.564 --> 30:15.331
I will stay with you as long
as they will let me, okay?

30:15.367 --> 30:16.599
Come with me.

30:20.139 --> 30:21.972
Listen, I cannot tell you what to do...

30:23.341 --> 30:25.275
but I think that you should disclose.

30:27.245 --> 30:28.778
- Okay?
- Okay.

30:28.813 --> 30:31.681
Umm... I'm transgender,

30:31.716 --> 30:33.383
and I feel like I'm at risk.

30:33.418 --> 30:35.151
So, you're a girl?

30:35.187 --> 30:38.221
Hey. Shut your face before I
come in there and shut it for you.

30:41.025 --> 30:44.493
I won't be safe in a men's prison.

30:44.528 --> 30:45.995
So what are you saying? You...

30:46.030 --> 30:47.407
you want to go to a women's prison?

30:47.431 --> 30:49.398
No. I don't belong there either.

30:51.368 --> 30:52.601
Okay.

30:52.636 --> 30:55.171
Uh, we have a situation.

31:10.954 --> 31:12.187
How you feeling?

31:13.690 --> 31:14.989
Am I in heaven?

31:17.861 --> 31:20.195
Because I'm pretty sure...

31:20.230 --> 31:23.064
I'm looking at an angel.

31:25.168 --> 31:27.368
- You're ridiculous.
- Very funny, Grace.

31:27.403 --> 31:28.569
It was very funny.

31:29.872 --> 31:32.273
Y'all need to lighten up.

31:33.309 --> 31:35.209
You know, my first choice was...

31:35.245 --> 31:37.311
"I see dead people."

31:43.953 --> 31:46.553
Speaking of dead people, where's Mom?

31:48.057 --> 31:52.025
She went home for a bit, so you
could spend some time with your dad.

31:55.798 --> 31:58.132
- I'll talk to you later, okay?
- Okay.

32:03.639 --> 32:06.406
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Grace.

32:06.441 --> 32:08.742
Is that a sweater? It's so pretty.

32:08.777 --> 32:11.244
- Nice color, right?
- Yeah.

32:13.815 --> 32:15.548
I'll get it!

32:18.820 --> 32:21.331
- They booked my friend!
- You were only supposed to document what happened.

32:21.355 --> 32:23.656
We weren't just gonna
sit there and watch!

32:23.691 --> 32:26.192
And Aaron was pushed
into that agent, okay?

32:26.227 --> 32:28.127
You saw it! I know you did!

32:28.163 --> 32:30.362
- He was not obstructing!
- What am I supposed to do?

32:30.398 --> 32:32.098
Tell them what really happened!

32:32.133 --> 32:34.344
They're already pretty sure that
there was a leak about the raid.

32:34.368 --> 32:36.234
If I suddenly start
defending your friend,

32:36.270 --> 32:37.369
it's gonna set off alarms.

32:37.405 --> 32:40.038
Someone needs to set off some alarms!

32:40.073 --> 32:41.618
Okay? I thought that's
what we were doing!

32:41.642 --> 32:44.075
And if not, then what was
your big apology about?

32:44.111 --> 32:45.221
What? You feel bad for Ximena,

32:45.245 --> 32:47.190
but not bad enough to actually
doing something about it.

32:47.214 --> 32:49.448
- Is that it?
- Look, I'm doing what I can.

32:49.483 --> 32:51.662
Look, giving a statement like
that could cost me my job.

32:51.686 --> 32:53.618
I've been doing this for 30 years.

32:53.653 --> 32:55.320
I can't just start over.

32:55.355 --> 32:57.088
I've got a family to provide for

32:57.124 --> 32:58.290
and a pension to think about.

32:58.325 --> 33:00.692
And I'm not sacrificing
all that. I'm sorry.

33:13.603 --> 33:14.760
Any news?

33:16.151 --> 33:18.284
I just know they booked him.

33:18.319 --> 33:19.819
I don't know where he is.

33:21.022 --> 33:22.922
That's really good, Callie.

33:24.259 --> 33:26.259
And I know you guys are...

33:26.294 --> 33:29.129
taking it slow, or
resetting, or whatever, but...

33:30.665 --> 33:33.599
I don't care what you say.
You're in love with him.

33:37.905 --> 33:40.105
_

33:42.977 --> 33:44.777
Where are you?

33:44.812 --> 33:46.422
I didn't think that I
had a history with this,

33:46.446 --> 33:48.247
with anxiety and depression,

33:48.282 --> 33:51.616
but my... my son,
Brandon, uh, reminded me

33:51.652 --> 33:54.086
that this had happened
before when he was little.

33:54.121 --> 33:56.688
Um, it was right around the
time that I... I left my husband.

33:56.723 --> 34:00.092
I was very unhappy.

34:00.127 --> 34:03.395
Struggling. Trying to come
to terms with my sexuality.

34:03.430 --> 34:05.330
Are you unhappy now?

34:06.600 --> 34:08.065
No. Mm-mm.

34:10.536 --> 34:12.337
Well, with panic attacks,

34:12.371 --> 34:14.049
it's important to
understand the difference

34:14.072 --> 34:16.708
between the cause and the trigger.

34:16.743 --> 34:18.576
The cause is usually something deep,

34:18.612 --> 34:21.279
some trauma that's been
festering for a while.

34:21.313 --> 34:24.380
But the trigger is often
something very specific.

34:24.417 --> 34:27.451
Some thought or feeling
that happens in the moment.

34:28.587 --> 34:29.899
Is there anything that you can think of

34:29.922 --> 34:31.688
that happened at the grocery store?

34:31.724 --> 34:33.590
They were out of dark
chocolate. That's...

34:37.530 --> 34:40.364
No. Nope.

34:43.168 --> 34:46.337
So, what were you thinking
right before it happened?

34:46.371 --> 34:47.371
Do you remember?

34:47.406 --> 34:50.373
Uh...

34:50.409 --> 34:53.109
Right before I went shopping,
my next-door neighbor came by

34:53.145 --> 34:55.277
to tell me that he and
his wife are separating.

34:55.313 --> 34:58.315
- I guess I was thinking about that.
- What about it?

34:59.551 --> 35:00.851
Well, I...

35:00.886 --> 35:03.031
Kinda hoping that it wasn't my fault.

35:03.055 --> 35:05.322
And why would their
separation be your fault?

35:05.357 --> 35:07.490
Um...

35:07.525 --> 35:09.359
Well, his, uh, his wife...

35:09.394 --> 35:11.728
uh, was an old high
school friend of mine.

35:12.831 --> 35:14.864
And they just recently
moved back to San Diego.

35:14.899 --> 35:16.109
Uh, next door, as a matter of fact,

35:16.133 --> 35:18.901
and um... she was, uh,

35:18.936 --> 35:20.603
she was my first love.

35:20.638 --> 35:22.171
My first crush.

35:24.242 --> 35:27.476
Anyway, Tess, that's his wife...

35:27.511 --> 35:29.711
told me that she was
questioning her sexuality.

35:29.747 --> 35:33.648
Um, and I said to her that she
needs to really talk to her husband.

35:36.220 --> 35:37.652
So, I... I guess I...

35:37.688 --> 35:39.321
uh, I don't know.

35:40.491 --> 35:42.257
Your first love moved in next door.

35:43.326 --> 35:44.760
That's something.

35:46.162 --> 35:48.029
Do you think that that
could be triggering you?

35:50.434 --> 35:51.566
No.

35:54.905 --> 35:56.137
How'd it go with your dad?

35:57.340 --> 35:58.340
Oh, it was nice.

35:58.375 --> 35:59.407
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:00.843 --> 36:02.110
Yeah, he's super sweet.

36:03.613 --> 36:06.347
I just... I don't think he's ready

36:06.383 --> 36:08.749
to handle my medical situation.

36:11.922 --> 36:14.122
Did you have anything to
do with my mom going home?

36:15.858 --> 36:17.024
Uh...

36:18.027 --> 36:20.260
yeah. I... I... I may
have talked to her.

36:22.765 --> 36:24.264
You really are an angel.

36:25.935 --> 36:27.134
Thank you.

36:32.341 --> 36:33.540
Hi. Is this a good time?

36:34.944 --> 36:37.577
Um, I'm kinda craving a root beer.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.346
You wanna get me one?

36:39.381 --> 36:41.815
- Uh, yeah, sure.
- Cool, thanks.

36:45.988 --> 36:47.487
This is the paperwork you asked for.

36:47.522 --> 36:49.155
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

37:32.867 --> 37:34.332
So, what happened?

37:34.368 --> 37:36.602
- Did they drop the charges?
- I guess.

37:36.637 --> 37:39.404
Uh, some agent came forward
and corroborated my story.

37:40.840 --> 37:44.042
I talked to Allen, but I didn't
think he was gonna do anything.

37:44.077 --> 37:46.744
Thank God he did.

37:46.779 --> 37:48.899
I don't think I could have
handled much more solitary.

37:49.816 --> 37:51.216
They put you in solitary?

37:52.652 --> 37:54.852
Yeah. For my own protection.

37:56.923 --> 37:57.955
I'm so sorry.

37:59.258 --> 38:02.159
I remember how awful that is.

38:02.194 --> 38:05.530
Um, it's okay. I wasn't there long.

38:07.366 --> 38:09.567
Most trans people
aren't so lucky though.

38:10.669 --> 38:12.536
I mean, putting someone in solitary

38:12.571 --> 38:14.149
because you don't know
what to do with them,

38:14.173 --> 38:17.574
that's... not a solution.
It's de-humanizing.

38:19.658 --> 38:24.428
I hope it's okay that I told my mom.

38:24.463 --> 38:26.563
I just... I had to do something.

38:26.598 --> 38:28.899
It's fine. I'm glad she was there.

38:31.870 --> 38:33.904
Um...

38:33.939 --> 38:35.605
I was thinking. Uh...

38:37.910 --> 38:39.810
I think you should put
my scars in the portrait.

38:40.979 --> 38:42.345
Are you sure?

38:44.249 --> 38:47.450
Yeah. I think I need to, um...

38:47.485 --> 38:48.818
tell people my story.

38:50.221 --> 38:52.088
So...

38:52.123 --> 38:54.090
you want to, like, come out?

38:54.125 --> 38:56.125
Telling people you're trans is different

38:56.161 --> 38:57.593
than coming out as gay.

38:58.663 --> 39:00.796
When you come out as gay,

39:00.832 --> 39:02.598
people see you as being more authentic.

39:02.633 --> 39:05.968
Whereas when you tell
people you're trans,

39:06.003 --> 39:09.438
people sometimes think
that you've deceived them.

39:09.474 --> 39:12.174
You pulled something over on 'em.

39:12.209 --> 39:14.242
I guess I've never...

39:14.278 --> 39:16.044
thought about it like that.

39:16.080 --> 39:19.147
Mm. I don't really want to deal with it.

39:19.183 --> 39:21.283
But, uh...

39:21.318 --> 39:22.985
if we don't put a human face on this,

39:23.020 --> 39:24.552
I don't think anything's gonna change.

39:26.056 --> 39:28.957
Well, I'm here for whatever.

39:28.993 --> 39:30.592
You know that, right?

39:30.627 --> 39:32.461
Yeah. Thank you.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.917
Um...

39:56.952 --> 39:59.020
I went on a date with someone.

40:01.690 --> 40:03.090
Okay.

40:03.126 --> 40:05.692
And if this is us getting back together,

40:05.728 --> 40:07.828
then I will never see her again.

40:07.863 --> 40:11.264
But we said we'd tell each other, and...

40:11.299 --> 40:12.499
So, are we?

40:13.802 --> 40:15.536
Is that what this is?

40:17.172 --> 40:19.172
Um, I...

40:19.207 --> 40:23.743
Yeah, I don't think I'm ready
