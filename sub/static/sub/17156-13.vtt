[galloping hooves]

00:08.508 --> 00:11.210
Greetings, Tantabus. I am ready.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.045
Do your worst.

00:13.047 --> 00:19.585
[grunts]

00:19.587 --> 00:22.621
Princess Luna's turning into
Nightmare Moon...again!

00:23.623 --> 00:29.661
[evil laugh]

00:29.663 --> 00:32.364
Yeah? Well, we've got
the cure for that!

00:51.185 --> 00:54.353
Wait! What is it doing?

00:56.589 --> 00:58.724
NO! It's gone!

[happy squeals]

01:07.167 --> 01:09.635

01:09.637 --> 01:12.237
My dream ended happily?

01:12.239 --> 01:14.573
That cannot happen!

01:54.648 --> 01:56.115
[noisy yawn]

01:56.117 --> 01:59.618
Yeah, Rarity, thanks
for setting all this up.

01:59.620 --> 02:03.155
A grooming day for our pets
really was a great idea.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.262
[cat yowls]

02:10.264 --> 02:12.798
Oh my! Oh I'm sorry!

02:12.800 --> 02:15.701
I didn't get my normal
beauty sleep last night.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.402
[hiss]

02:17.404 --> 02:21.340
You know, [yawn] I didn't
sleep well either.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.342
[agreeing murmurs]

02:23.344 --> 02:25.277
[upbeat] I'm totally beat, too!

02:26.313 --> 02:30.616
All right, Winona,
time fer yer brushin'.

02:30.618 --> 02:31.817
[yelp of pain]

02:35.221 --> 02:36.188
[splash]

02:36.190 --> 02:40.792
Whoops. I guess I'm too plumb
tuckered out to do this right.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.728
[yawn]

02:42.730 --> 02:44.930
I even went to bed
early last night.

02:44.932 --> 02:47.900
But then I had a
really scary nightmare.

02:47.902 --> 02:49.801
All: Me too!

02:49.803 --> 02:53.305
Uh, only, you know, I didn't
think mine was THAT scary.

02:53.307 --> 02:56.642
Well, mine sure was. There was
this blue smoke monster and-

02:58.846 --> 03:02.681
I dreamt about a blue
smoke thingee too!

03:02.683 --> 03:04.349
Me too!

03:04.351 --> 03:07.486
So what? Probably
just a coincidence.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.755
That's an awfully
big coincidence.

03:09.757 --> 03:12.424
Huh. I wonder why I didn't
have that nightmare.

03:12.426 --> 03:13.725
I slept great!

03:15.562 --> 03:19.831
So then what could have given
us all the same nightmare?

03:19.833 --> 03:22.668
I don't know. But I
do know who might.

03:22.670 --> 03:25.571
Spike, could you send a
scroll to Princess Luna?

03:25.573 --> 03:26.505
Sure.

03:27.374 --> 03:31.910
Dear Princess Luna. Last night,
my friends and I all dreamt

03:31.912 --> 03:34.913
of a creature made
of blue smoke.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.316
I'm sure you're very busy, but

03:37.318 --> 03:38.584
[yawn]

03:38.586 --> 03:40.319
when you have the chance,

03:40.321 --> 03:43.488
please let me know if you have
any idea what it could mean.

03:43.490 --> 03:47.826
Yours, [yawn] Princess
Twilight Sparkle.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.494
You can leave out the yawns.

03:52.699 --> 03:53.932
[whoosh]

03:55.769 --> 03:59.705
Which of you saw the creature of
blue smoke in your nightmare?

03:59.707 --> 04:02.007
Wow! That was fast!

04:02.009 --> 04:03.408
We all did.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.843
Not me!

04:04.845 --> 04:07.012
Ugh! We know!

04:07.014 --> 04:09.982
So you've encountered
the smoke monster, too?

04:09.984 --> 04:12.584
The Tantubus is a
creature of my nightmares!

04:12.586 --> 04:15.287
It escaped from my
slumbers yesterday.

04:15.289 --> 04:18.257
But, how did it get into ours?

04:18.259 --> 04:20.459
The Tantabus is like a parasite.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.761
My dreams must no
longer be enough for it.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.464
Now it seeks others
to infect and corrupt.

04:25.466 --> 04:28.634
It must have learned of you six
from seeing you in my dream.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.737
Whoa whoa whoa! So what
you're saying is...

04:31.739 --> 04:34.773
You dreamt about all
of them and not me?

04:36.943 --> 04:40.312
So Smokey gave us bad
dreams. No biggie.

04:40.314 --> 04:43.882
I saw that the Tantabus
had grown more powerful,

04:43.884 --> 04:46.585
but I did not realize that
power was enough to enable it

04:46.587 --> 04:47.986
to escape my dreams.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.989
If its power grows,
it could very well

04:50.991 --> 04:53.492
find a way to escape
into the real world.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.460
It could turn all of Equestria
into a living nightmare!

05:00.600 --> 05:06.071
OK, OK, OK! I take it back. That
does sound bad! Really bad!

05:09.309 --> 05:10.475
Twilight: We've
prepared everything

05:10.477 --> 05:11.977
exactly as you requested.

05:11.979 --> 05:16.515
Good. As you six slumber here,
I will pursue the creature

05:16.517 --> 05:18.884
into whichever of your
dreams it infests.

05:18.886 --> 05:22.421
Ooh! It'll be like a
princess sleepover!

05:22.423 --> 05:25.390
Speaking of Princesses, aren't
you going to ask Celestia

05:25.392 --> 05:27.059
for her help as well?

05:27.061 --> 05:28.994
There is nothing
my sister can do.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.530
She has no power in
the realm of sleep.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.765
Only I can move
from dream to dream.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.435
I am afraid no pony
can help me tonight.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.736
Even us?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.538
Especially you.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.074
You have all suffered
so much because of me.

05:42.076 --> 05:45.510
while I hunt the
Tantabus in your dreams.

05:47.113 --> 05:50.749
I know you said no pony
can help, but I'm no pony.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.719
I'm going to stay up and watch
over you guys just in case.

05:55.054 --> 05:57.522
Oh, thank you, Spike.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.926
One good thing about not
sleeping well last night:

06:00.928 --> 06:03.562
shouldn't be too hard
to fall asleep now!

06:03.564 --> 06:05.364
Are you kidding?
This is so exciting,

06:05.366 --> 06:07.366
I don't know how
I'm ever going to -

06:07.368 --> 06:14.439
[snoring]

06:42.702 --> 06:46.405
Oh my! This is simply divine!

06:48.741 --> 06:50.142
How avant-garde!

06:57.016 --> 07:00.018
Forget avant-garde. I should
have said, "en-garde!"

07:00.020 --> 07:01.620
[squeals]

07:05.057 --> 07:06.091
It is here!

07:12.433 --> 07:15.901
You were such a
pretty little chiffon!

07:15.903 --> 07:19.504
What kind of monster
would do this?

07:19.506 --> 07:20.672
The Tantabus.

07:20.674 --> 07:26.445
No! Please! I don't want you to
suffer any more because of me.

07:27.647 --> 07:28.780
I will catch it!

07:39.025 --> 07:40.659
It has jumped into
another dream!

07:40.661 --> 07:42.828
I am sorry, but if
I am to stop it,

07:42.830 --> 07:44.463
I must follow it
where you cannot.

07:44.465 --> 07:45.130
Go!

07:45.132 --> 07:46.598
[crash]

07:46.600 --> 07:48.700
I shall be able to
handle things here!

07:48.702 --> 07:49.568
[gulp]

07:49.570 --> 07:50.769
I hope.

07:51.604 --> 07:54.806
<i>â™ª La la la la ! </i>

07:54.808 --> 07:56.141
[giggle]

07:56.143 --> 07:57.809
<i>â™ª La la la la la! </i>

07:57.811 --> 08:01.513
I followed the Tantabus
here. Now I need only find--

08:01.515 --> 08:04.082
Sorry! Can't help it. An
idea pops into my head and--

08:04.084 --> 08:04.916
[gasp]

08:04.918 --> 08:06.885
Oooh! Cake!

08:10.790 --> 08:12.023
[splat]

08:13.593 --> 08:15.227
[growl]

08:15.229 --> 08:16.895
Eww! Cake!

08:20.199 --> 08:21.766
[whoosh]

08:26.906 --> 08:27.806
No!

08:27.808 --> 08:28.740
Sorry!

08:31.043 --> 08:33.211
Who wants ice cream?

08:37.116 --> 08:40.819
Hmmm. It's so nice to
be the pet for once.

08:47.093 --> 08:49.294
[shriek]

08:49.296 --> 08:53.198
N-n-nice, giant, evil Angel?

08:53.200 --> 08:56.201
[panicked yelp]

08:56.203 --> 08:58.970
Whew! Oh, thank you, Princess!

09:02.675 --> 09:03.275
[slam]

09:03.277 --> 09:06.745
[chomping]

09:08.315 --> 09:12.717
Now, this is what I call
an incredible dream!

09:39.345 --> 09:41.713
I can see the Tantabus has
already turned your slumbers

09:41.715 --> 09:42.814
into a nightmare!

09:42.816 --> 09:44.649
What are you talking about?

09:44.651 --> 09:46.284
This is my favorite dream!

09:51.123 --> 09:55.860
<i>â™ª We are such happy flowers! </i>

09:55.862 --> 10:00.031
â™ª We will now sing for hours!

10:00.033 --> 10:04.135
<i>â™ª Aren't we unbearably cute? </i>

10:04.137 --> 10:09.074
â™ª Watch me solo on jazz flute!

10:09.076 --> 10:11.910
â™ª

10:11.912 --> 10:13.979
[screams in horror]

10:26.993 --> 10:27.892
Huh?

10:27.894 --> 10:28.860
[gasp]

10:34.033 --> 10:35.033
[gasp]

10:38.304 --> 10:39.337
Luna!

10:42.742 --> 10:46.411
[grunts]

10:48.414 --> 10:50.081
[shuddering yelps]

10:50.083 --> 10:52.083
What happened? Are you guys OK?

10:52.085 --> 10:54.819
That...that was terrible!

10:54.821 --> 10:58.289
I...I never want to have
that nightmare again!

10:58.291 --> 10:59.357
[shudder]

10:59.359 --> 11:00.392
Me either!

11:02.128 --> 11:04.863
But Luna caught it? Didn't she?

11:04.865 --> 11:07.932
I am so sorry, my
friends. I failed.

11:08.968 --> 11:12.771
It will be back to infect your
dreams the next time you sleep.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.272
Oh, no!

11:15.241 --> 11:17.342
Yeah, I reckon I could
live without seeing

11:17.344 --> 11:19.444
that thing ever again.

11:19.446 --> 11:22.947
But you will. Again
and again. Every night.

11:22.949 --> 11:26.317
Until it grows powerful enough
to infect the waking world!

11:26.319 --> 11:28.753
After what I did
as Nightmare Moon,

11:28.755 --> 11:31.856
the fact that I am once again
responsible for harming others

11:31.858 --> 11:33.758
is more than I can bear.

11:33.760 --> 11:37.095
It'll be OK. Everypony
makes mistakes.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.698
As long as none of you
dreamt about another pony,

11:39.700 --> 11:42.167
the Tantabus remains
confined to your dreams.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.903
I still have a chance to catch
it before it's too late!

11:44.905 --> 11:48.106
Although after you left,
I did happen to dream

11:48.108 --> 11:50.809
I was eating a giant ice
cream cone with all of Ponyville

11:50.811 --> 11:52.444
while taking a test
we hadn't studied for.

11:52.446 --> 11:56.247
See, what did I tell ya?
Everypony makes mistakes!

12:01.821 --> 12:04.255
But that means the Tantabus
could be turning every dream

12:04.257 --> 12:06.424
in Ponyville into a nightmare!

12:06.426 --> 12:11.196
Infecting all those dreams
gives it more and more power.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.765
Soon it will be able to
escape into the real world

12:13.767 --> 12:16.134
and infect Equestria with
its nightmare plague!

12:16.136 --> 12:19.270
Then you must let us help you
stop it before that happens!

12:19.272 --> 12:22.240
But how? The Tantabus
was able to escape Luna

12:22.242 --> 12:25.043
when it only had SIX
dreams it could get to.

12:25.045 --> 12:28.012
It is true. With so
many dreams to hide in,

12:28.014 --> 12:30.448
I do not know how
I can catch it.

12:30.450 --> 12:34.886
Hmmm. What if everypony in
Ponyville were having one dream?

12:35.988 --> 12:39.257
I can create shared dreams, yes.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.426
But for so many ponies at once?

12:41.428 --> 12:43.762
I have never done
anything like that.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.864
The amount of power
it would take...

12:45.866 --> 12:49.334
Fluttershy: Well, it is
worth a try. Isn't it?

12:49.336 --> 12:52.137
Of course. I will do
anything to end this.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.038
Including accept your help.

12:54.040 --> 12:57.175
I cannot allow the Tantabus to
escape into the real world.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.878
All of you must now
go back to sleep.

12:59.880 --> 13:03.181
And hope that I can
create such a dream...

13:03.183 --> 13:07.051
[snoring]

13:13.225 --> 13:20.298
[whoosh]

13:44.490 --> 13:46.457
[gasp] Princess Luna did it!

13:50.596 --> 13:54.265
Big Mac! Boy, I'm glad to
see something familiar!

13:57.503 --> 13:59.370
E-yup.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.472
Princess Luna: Ponies!

14:01.474 --> 14:04.309
Princess Luna!

14:04.311 --> 14:06.945
There is no time for
bowing, my friends.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.547
There is something coming!
Something terrible.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.584
No! It is already here!

14:12.586 --> 14:14.319
[roar]

14:14.321 --> 14:17.355
[screams]

14:17.357 --> 14:23.461
I am so sorry. I brought this
upon you. But I will end it now!

14:23.463 --> 14:26.564
[zaps]

14:26.566 --> 14:29.000
[roar]

14:29.002 --> 14:30.401
[screams]

14:30.403 --> 14:32.637
Princess! What's wrong?

14:32.639 --> 14:33.605
[straining]

14:33.607 --> 14:35.940
It is taking all my strength

14:35.942 --> 14:38.309
just to hold this
massive dream together!

14:38.311 --> 14:40.144
You will have to stop it!

14:40.146 --> 14:42.981
I truly wish I did not
have to ask this of you.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.917
Then you're in luck.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.886
Yeah! We're already on it!

15:04.637 --> 15:06.204
[frightened squeals]

15:06.206 --> 15:09.040
Please, I'll pay you anything!

15:10.042 --> 15:11.242
[roar]

15:11.244 --> 15:12.410
Ya-wah!

15:14.013 --> 15:15.113
I got ya!

15:15.115 --> 15:17.081
[panicked cries]

15:17.083 --> 15:18.650
[grunts]

15:22.655 --> 15:24.389
[grunts]

15:27.126 --> 15:27.992
[chomp]

15:27.994 --> 15:29.694
[wails]

15:35.534 --> 15:36.601
Oh, no!

15:36.603 --> 15:41.339
Big Mac! You can do anything
in a dream, remember?

15:42.641 --> 15:44.509
[whinny]

15:55.621 --> 15:58.356
E-wheeeeeee.

16:00.559 --> 16:03.127
C'mon! If that Tantabus
thing turns any more

16:03.129 --> 16:04.562
of this dream against us,

16:04.564 --> 16:07.198
we'll be too busy saving
ponies to catch it

16:07.200 --> 16:10.735
and it'll grow powerful enough
to escape into the real world!

16:12.137 --> 16:14.572
How are we even gonna know
when it's able to escape?

16:20.646 --> 16:22.547
Oh, I think we'll know.

16:32.391 --> 16:33.624
Hurry, my friends!

16:40.699 --> 16:43.101
Please! We need your help, too!

16:47.539 --> 16:50.141
Fluttershy's right! We've
all got to work together

16:50.143 --> 16:52.110
to stop it from escaping!

16:52.112 --> 16:56.080
But how can we help? No pony
in Ponyville has your magic.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.782
Or your speed.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.484
That's true!

16:59.486 --> 17:01.419
In Ponyville.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.288
But this here isn't
Ponyville! It's a dream!

17:06.292 --> 17:10.061
And not just any.
This is YOUR dream.

17:10.063 --> 17:13.231
Anything you can do in your
dreams, you can do now!

17:16.802 --> 17:19.404
Well, if you're gonna dream,
might as well dream big, right?

17:20.606 --> 17:21.706
He-ya!

17:24.643 --> 17:26.177
[cheers]

17:26.179 --> 17:33.251
â™ª

17:59.178 --> 18:00.511
It's working!

18:00.513 --> 18:01.612
But it's not enough.

18:06.552 --> 18:09.520
Then do more! This
is a dream, remember?

18:09.522 --> 18:16.594
â™ª

18:37.249 --> 18:40.284
I cannot hold this
dream together much longer.

18:40.286 --> 18:43.554
Equestria will
fall because of me!

18:46.792 --> 18:50.428
[growl]

18:51.463 --> 18:54.632
Am I crazy or did it
just get even bigger

18:54.634 --> 18:56.334
after Luna said that?

18:57.302 --> 19:00.271
I think it's feeding off
your guilt, Princess Luna!

19:00.273 --> 19:03.808
If that is so, then perhaps that
is how it grew strong enough

19:03.810 --> 19:05.643
to escape in the first place!

19:06.845 --> 19:08.379
Say what now?

19:09.648 --> 19:11.816
I created the Tantabus

19:11.818 --> 19:15.286
to give myself the same
nightmare every night.

19:15.288 --> 19:19.690
To punish myself for the evil
I caused as Nightmare Moon.

19:19.692 --> 19:22.326
But why would you do that?

19:22.328 --> 19:25.329
To make sure I
never forgave myself

19:25.331 --> 19:28.266
for how much Equestria
suffered because of me.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.501
But it seems I have
not learned my lesson,

19:30.503 --> 19:33.304
for now I have only
made you suffer more!

19:33.306 --> 19:36.641
[roar]

19:36.643 --> 19:39.877
But that means you might just be
the key to stopping all this!

19:39.879 --> 19:42.547
Yeah! If it gets strong
because you feel bad

19:42.549 --> 19:45.216
about what you did
as Nightmare Moon,

19:45.218 --> 19:48.619
then you just gotta stop
feeling bad for what you did!

19:48.621 --> 19:53.191
How can I forgive myself? I am
no better now than I was then!

19:53.193 --> 19:58.229
My creation is about to turn the
world into a living nightmare!

19:58.231 --> 19:59.964
But look at what YOU'RE doing!

19:59.966 --> 20:01.832
Nightmare Moon would
have wanted the Tantabus

20:01.834 --> 20:04.569
to turn Equestria
into a nightmare.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.205
You're doing everything
you can to stop it!

20:07.207 --> 20:11.576
That proves you're not the same
pony you were then!

20:11.578 --> 20:13.711
Everypony who knows you
knows that Nightmare Moon

20:13.713 --> 20:15.246
is in the past.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.315
We all trust you, Luna.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.218
Do you trust us enough
to believe we're right?

20:24.756 --> 20:26.457
I do!

20:26.459 --> 20:29.393
[growl]

20:29.395 --> 20:32.663
[moan]

20:39.238 --> 20:40.371
[ding]

20:42.908 --> 20:45.977
Thank you. Thank you all!

20:48.447 --> 20:50.314
[rooster crows]

20:51.617 --> 20:53.284
[gasp]

20:56.755 --> 21:01.626
She sure did! Only, I'm not
exactly sure WHAT she did.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.462
Luna created the Tantabus
to punish herself.

21:04.464 --> 21:07.431
The worse she felt,
the more power it had.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.300
But once she finally
forgave herself

21:09.302 --> 21:10.801
for what Nightmare Moon did...

21:10.803 --> 21:11.702
Poof!

21:11.704 --> 21:12.937
Shhh!

21:14.740 --> 21:17.341
Huh. Wonder what she's
dreaming about now?
