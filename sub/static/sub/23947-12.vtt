00:16.056 --> 00:16.891
Koku.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.313
Let me give you one piece of advice.

00:23.648 --> 00:26.860
Whatever happens,
don't go near the Jetblack.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.112
Why not?

00:29.529 --> 00:33.867
The black-winged king, who was called
a god and boasted of his invincibility,

00:34.743 --> 00:38.538
was killed there by the human
who became this country's first ruler.

00:40.540 --> 00:44.586
Whenever someone who can't possibly lose
loses, there's always a reason.

00:45.795 --> 00:46.629
A reason?

00:47.172 --> 00:51.801
Most likely, the Jetblack siphons off
your ability to regenerate.

00:53.011 --> 00:56.806
Listen, whatever happens,
don't get lured to that place.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.105
What are these tears for?

01:05.272 --> 01:08.818
Frustration? Pain? Despair? Sadness?

01:09.402 --> 01:10.236
Which one?

01:12.781 --> 01:16.076
This moment is the only reason
I've kept you alive.

01:16.993 --> 01:21.831
As is written in the inscription,
you and he will meet your end here.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.083
And then...

01:25.877 --> 01:29.631
I'll engrave the legend of a new king
into the inscription.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.691
This is what it boils down to.

01:49.275 --> 01:52.779
What if Minatsuki was used
as an incubator to refine a vaccine

01:52.862 --> 01:56.491
and a treatment
that stabilized the Reggies was developed?

01:57.408 --> 02:01.287
The public will know money collected
for the noble goal of resurrecting gods

02:01.538 --> 02:04.958
was used to manufacture
living weapons instead.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.169
Also, everyone will learn
that the military oversaw it,

02:09.253 --> 02:12.882
and will know the name of Albert Puzo,
head of their development.

02:14.592 --> 02:15.718
Your father.

02:18.054 --> 02:20.890
I saw his corpse on display
in that room of yours.

02:24.435 --> 02:29.774
In his later years, my father started to
come around to Dr. Kazama's point of view.

02:31.401 --> 02:35.572
Perhaps he grew...
sentimental in his old age.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.160
If anyone understands, it's you.

02:40.743 --> 02:44.831
What a country truly requires
isn't gods or medicines.

02:46.249 --> 02:49.127
In cities around the world,
with just one signal,

02:49.586 --> 02:54.465
unstable weapons disguised as humans will
kill everyone nearby until they die too.

02:54.799 --> 02:58.094
It is fear of Reggies
that keeps this country safe.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.638
Why did you keep Minatsuki alive, then?

03:02.932 --> 03:05.602
It wasn't out of altruism
or some noble cause.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.448
After you killed your prey,

03:18.948 --> 03:22.869
you'd have Minatsuki brainwash a Reggie
and set him up as the killer.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.706
And then Market Maker tidies up
any bread crumbs.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.793
It's the ideal arrangement.
You can't possibly let that go.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.922
The man who knows it all, Keith Flick.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.634
The mind of a god. Prodigy. Genie.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.803
You think you know everything, don't you?

03:41.221 --> 03:44.098
But you're just like me, aren't you?

03:45.266 --> 03:47.894
You made contact so you could exploit him.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.981
The monster named Koku.

03:54.984 --> 03:55.944
So you're here...

03:56.903 --> 03:57.779
Koku.

04:25.556 --> 04:28.476
Koku.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.186
Yuna!

04:35.024 --> 04:36.901
You took longer than I thought.

04:37.735 --> 04:40.488
What did you do to Yuna?

04:41.698 --> 04:44.325
Don't worry. She isn't dead yet.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.245
She isn't going to die

04:48.454 --> 04:50.748
until after I've made her watch you die.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.221
Don't try to put me on your level.

05:07.598 --> 05:11.644
You deceive everyone and
exploit everything for your own benefit.

05:11.728 --> 05:12.812
It's what you are.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.982
There's no regret or remorse in you.

05:16.733 --> 05:20.611
The instant you feel a twinge of guilt,
you create a separate personality.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.365
By driving that first personality
into a corner and erasing it,

05:24.574 --> 05:26.659
you reset your emotions back to zero.

05:28.119 --> 05:32.540
You shift your flaw of having
to kill to survive onto someone else,

05:33.082 --> 05:35.460
and stave off a complete mental breakdown.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.758
The real monster here isn't Koku
or even Minatsuki.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.721
It's you... Gilbert Ross.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.992
What's the matter?
Your body isn't moving the way you want?

06:16.959 --> 06:19.754
Those wounds won't close, not here.

06:21.589 --> 06:24.092
This is the place
for endings and beginnings.

06:24.926 --> 06:28.805
It only helps those
who have accepted their fate.

06:30.139 --> 06:33.643
Leave a trail of illogical
and unsolvable puzzles,

06:34.102 --> 06:36.104
and you'll definitely take the bait.

06:37.313 --> 06:40.066
The inscription's legends
are the ultimate motif.

06:40.817 --> 06:44.570
A fantastical story.
The tragedies surrounding it.

06:45.655 --> 06:49.659
You became trapped in the labyrinth
I constructed for you.

06:50.576 --> 06:54.580
With each puzzle you solve,
the mystery grows and you fall deeper.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.707
Deeper. Deeper.

06:57.917 --> 07:01.379
And there at the bottom is darkness
as black as velvet.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.340
Devoid of friendship and love,

07:05.466 --> 07:07.301
a world where there is nothing.

07:13.307 --> 07:14.767
Keith Flick.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.186
This is all about you.

07:17.687 --> 07:21.482
They're all vignettes designed
to drive you into action.

07:22.608 --> 07:26.112
You would be tormented, suffer,
and fumble for answers.

07:27.113 --> 07:30.908
And then you would step into my world
of your own volition.

07:32.076 --> 07:35.079
You would look at me
with eyes overflowing with hate.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.208
And when I witness that moment
with my own two eyes,

07:40.668 --> 07:42.879
that will be the ultimate pleasure,

07:43.671 --> 07:45.423
one that surpasses even murder.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.011
Are you kidding me?

07:51.220 --> 07:52.430
"Fate"?

07:52.889 --> 07:56.642
I won't be a puppet
to something so stupid!

07:57.852 --> 08:00.771
Whatever happens, I swear...

08:01.481 --> 08:02.982
I'll keep Yuna safe!

08:11.949 --> 08:14.535
What's the matter? Fight back.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.842
Let me see you fight against your fate.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.304
You don't understand.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.561
Like the cycle of death and rebirth,

08:41.437 --> 08:43.438
it will repeat forever.

08:45.149 --> 08:48.528
Inside our memories,
Erika has a new beginning--

08:48.611 --> 08:49.487
In the end,

08:50.112 --> 08:51.864
that's why you did all this?

08:53.074 --> 08:54.158
That's your answer?

09:01.582 --> 09:03.376
You enjoyed it too, didn't you?

09:04.710 --> 09:09.465
Each time you solved a riddle,
your cells overcame their grief

09:10.466 --> 09:13.010
and you basked in the joy of it.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.765
I wanted to make you see it.

09:24.021 --> 09:26.399
That you and I are the same.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.660
Go on, shoot.

09:41.163 --> 09:43.374
Shoot me, Keith.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.754
-He said what?
-You're sure about that?

09:49.130 --> 09:51.549
-He told me himself.
-No way!

09:52.300 --> 09:55.386
Erika's body had traces of cedar
and pine pollen on it.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.180
Gilbert himself leaked that info to me.

09:58.347 --> 10:02.143
You're right, this island's the only place
where both grow wild.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.605
-But if that's true--
-That's why I want to make sure.

10:06.272 --> 10:10.735
This mess was caused by the illusions
and charades orchestrated by Gilbert.

10:11.068 --> 10:15.573
At this very moment, we're all probably
being manipulated as part of his story.

10:16.157 --> 10:19.118
Operate with that in mind.
Is that clear, people?

10:19.702 --> 10:20.536
Roger that!

10:28.210 --> 10:31.756
I have no intention
of playing your game any longer.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.884
What will you do, then?

10:41.057 --> 10:42.183
Do you remember?

10:43.225 --> 10:46.479
It was a summer day,
with graduation approaching.

10:47.647 --> 10:51.776
When I asked if there was one thing
in this world you didn't understand,

10:51.859 --> 10:53.944
you immediately answered, "Murder."

10:55.404 --> 10:58.908
You heaped scorn on it,
saying it renounced rational thought.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.662
I saw you genuinely hate something.

11:04.997 --> 11:08.751
It felt as if you were rejecting me.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.715
For the first time in my life, I cried.

11:20.679 --> 11:21.639
-Lily!
-Lily!

11:21.722 --> 11:24.892
-Lily, wait! Don't go in on your own!
-Lily! Take a gun!

11:26.852 --> 11:28.312
You're not the only one.

11:29.188 --> 11:32.108
I truly loved Erika.

11:33.317 --> 11:38.447
I could fend off my madness
with her at my side. Or so I thought.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.074
But...

11:40.699 --> 11:42.034
Keith!

11:43.619 --> 11:45.496
You know why I did it, don't you?

11:46.622 --> 11:47.456
Erika...

11:48.457 --> 11:51.585
had fallen in love
with a man she shouldn't have.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.171
I had no choice.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.384
What's the matter?

11:59.385 --> 12:01.178
Pull the trigger, Keith.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.306
If you hesitate now,
I'll just do it again.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.725
Those you love.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.478
Those who owe their very existence to you.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.232
All those lives
that have ever touched yours,

12:13.649 --> 12:16.735
I'll make them my playthings
and destroy them.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.737
Keith, don't shoot him!

12:24.618 --> 12:27.246
I'll carve an indelible code into you.

12:34.879 --> 12:35.754
Gilbert Ross.

12:36.839 --> 12:37.965
You're under arrest.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.805
If you want to shoot, do it.

12:46.182 --> 12:49.310
Whatever happens,
I'll never become like you.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.062
You lose.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.899
You don't seem to understand.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.951
Who will be the first to arrive?

13:07.870 --> 13:08.746
Don't...

13:09.955 --> 13:10.873
Lily, eh?

13:12.541 --> 13:14.376
Just give up, Keith.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.796
It's already over.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.008
Don't do this, Gilbert.

13:21.967 --> 13:22.801
Keith!

13:23.260 --> 13:24.803
Don't do it!

13:27.973 --> 13:31.101
I put this into motion
to bring it all to an end.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.329
Almost there.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.165
It'll all be over soon.

13:53.707 --> 13:56.335
All will be as the inscription says.

13:57.711 --> 13:59.672
Once I dig out your other eye,

13:59.755 --> 14:02.341
I'll send you to Heaven
to join your friends.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.054
They aren't dead.

14:07.638 --> 14:08.556
What?

14:10.140 --> 14:11.475
-They're alive.
-Alive!

14:12.351 --> 14:17.231
-Dr. Kazama entrusted their future to me.
-We're all in here!

14:18.357 --> 14:21.944
-That's what I was created for.
-We're alive inside Koku.

14:24.905 --> 14:28.242
-They're alive inside of me.
-We'll be together forever.

14:29.869 --> 14:33.038
-Their consciousness, their memories,
-We'll keep Koku safe!

14:33.122 --> 14:34.999
they're all inside of me.

14:36.417 --> 14:39.336
You don't know what you're talking about.

14:40.713 --> 14:46.093
I have... Yuna and I have a duty
to carry them into the future.

14:47.678 --> 14:53.058
I won't let you, or even fate,
stand in the way of that!

14:55.519 --> 14:57.021
All right, the fun's over.

15:01.984 --> 15:02.818
Wait!

15:04.028 --> 15:04.862
Wait!

15:18.417 --> 15:21.503
Yuna, I forgive you for everything.

15:32.765 --> 15:38.103
Yuna!

15:41.857 --> 15:43.692
Koku.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.907
Yuna!

16:46.171 --> 16:48.465
The ancient legend will end,

16:49.675 --> 16:51.760
and a new tale will now begin.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.764
Your roles are now over.

16:56.932 --> 17:01.854
I'll make you pay
if it's the last thing I do!

17:05.065 --> 17:07.401
Farewell, Black-winged King.

17:20.998 --> 17:24.251
Why are you running?
You have nothing left now.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.295
Give in to your fate!

17:34.720 --> 17:38.974
Cut off my left leg.
It'll be useful to you someday.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.351
Izanami's blade?

17:44.688 --> 17:48.650
I gave serious thought to killing you.
But I decided against it.

17:49.902 --> 17:54.239
It would be rash. It would indeed be
the cessation of rational thought.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.577
So, it occurred to me
that I should test you.

18:00.871 --> 18:05.876
Would Keith Flick never commit murder
under any circumstances?

18:06.668 --> 18:08.962
Were his thought processes set in stone?

18:12.674 --> 18:14.676
This is a grand experiment.

18:15.969 --> 18:20.390
Fantasies that defy comprehension
would relentlessly assail a realist.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.769
The tragedy that bound it

18:24.311 --> 18:27.523
would gnaw away
at Keith Flick's mind and soul.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.693
Backed into a corner,
his neurons would grow agitated.

18:32.486 --> 18:37.574
And his soul, now ruled by madness,
would whisper to him...

18:40.828 --> 18:43.122
"Pull the trigger."

18:44.748 --> 18:47.835
I want to see that instant
from a front row seat.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.170
I want to etch it into my memory.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.006
I would force you to kill me.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.511
It takes four seconds
for brain activity to cease

18:57.761 --> 19:00.848
after the shot rings out
and the cranium is penetrated.

19:01.306 --> 19:04.434
Those seconds will be the ultimate moment,

19:05.018 --> 19:06.687
savored by you and I alone.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.365
Keith...

19:20.325 --> 19:24.246
morning will come to the world
even without me in it.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.214
As you bask in the light
of the morning sun,

19:34.965 --> 19:37.342
I will be reborn in your memory.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.862
I will live on inside of you.

19:59.072 --> 20:02.284
An indelible code will be etched into you.

20:05.996 --> 20:10.375
A new legend will begin, one about us.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.436
Pops, gimme the usual!

20:29.603 --> 20:31.021
Today's the day, huh?

20:32.606 --> 20:34.733
You think Keith's gonna show?

20:35.192 --> 20:38.028
Lily went to get him, right?
I think it'll be fine.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.738
It'll probably be fine.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.865
Lily's the reason I'm worried.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.408
You go, then.

20:43.492 --> 20:46.703
Yeah, go yourself,
you prematurely balding macho man!

20:49.122 --> 20:50.666
Hey, Mario! Good morning!

20:53.293 --> 20:55.128
-He actually left.
-Ignore him.

20:56.213 --> 20:59.091
Seems like life's back to normal.

20:59.508 --> 21:04.012
Right after, it was all "Market Maker,"
"Jaula Blanca," and "police cover-ups."

21:04.096 --> 21:08.976
There was a worldwide ruckus,
but it's quiet after only three months.

21:10.310 --> 21:14.439
That's how human beings are wired.
We get bored and we forget.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.566
That's what lets us start over.

21:16.650 --> 21:20.153
Yeah, but there's a lot of stuff
that needs to be worked out.

21:20.696 --> 21:24.783
That's exactly why he's coming back
from HQ.

21:25.575 --> 21:28.245
Maybe, but once Keith is back,

21:28.328 --> 21:31.707
I have a feeling
more creepy incidents will occur.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.752
-I can hardly wait!
-You're scary.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.302
Knock!

21:45.637 --> 21:47.973
Cut that out! Just come in.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.516
Good morning!

21:51.768 --> 21:53.437
Fresh from Matsuya!

21:53.645 --> 21:55.480
Don't make music by knocking!

21:55.564 --> 21:58.483
Today I attacked with a half-time shuffle!

21:58.567 --> 22:01.194
-Why do you attack every time?
-Upsy-daisy.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.405
COULDN'T DO IT AT ALL

22:05.449 --> 22:06.325
They're out.

22:08.368 --> 22:11.663
-But I bought enough for them!
-Don't look at me!

22:12.039 --> 22:13.874
If it's not important, go away.

22:13.957 --> 22:17.502
What're you talking about?
Today's your first day back at work!

22:17.669 --> 22:21.340
Boris told me to drag you in
even if I had to slap a leash on you!

22:21.423 --> 22:23.759
So I even bought some rope!

22:24.926 --> 22:26.136
My rope!

22:26.803 --> 22:28.305
Ta-da!

22:28.847 --> 22:30.057
What's that?

22:30.140 --> 22:32.684
I bought myself a '58!

22:32.934 --> 22:36.688
She might look dainty,
but I swapped out her engine for a 356!

22:36.772 --> 22:40.108
I even customized the exhaust manifold,
so she'll do 140 kph-- Hey!

22:40.192 --> 22:42.569
I can't ride in that, moron. I'm walking.

22:42.652 --> 22:44.571
Get in, or it's the rope!

22:47.032 --> 22:50.202
-Accept a lift when it's offered.
-Shut up.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.416
I know it's kinda late to ask.

22:57.375 --> 22:58.543
Your sister, Erika...

22:59.086 --> 23:00.087
She was adopted.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.798
I knew it.
She didn't look anything like you.

23:03.590 --> 23:04.966
Forget it, it's nothing.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.305
There's something I've been thinking about
for a while.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.809
He had a smile on his face when he died.

23:13.975 --> 23:18.230
I've been trying to figure out
what the emotion was behind that smile.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.525
Satisfaction? Superiority?

23:23.735 --> 23:24.986
What else would it be?

23:26.196 --> 23:27.072
Gratitude.

23:28.281 --> 23:29.908
This is just a thought,

23:30.158 --> 23:33.328
but what if Gilbert wanted to put an end
to his madness?

23:34.162 --> 23:37.833
But all those multiple personalities
in his head wouldn't let him.

23:38.333 --> 23:41.461
Basically,
he was no longer in control of himself.

23:42.546 --> 23:45.799
So maybe he put himself in your hands,
you know?

23:46.508 --> 23:48.927
He entrusted the role
of ending his madness,

23:49.553 --> 23:53.181
to the one and only person
who was superior to him, Keith Flick.

23:54.724 --> 23:58.562
And you arrived at that place
just as he hoped you would,

23:59.020 --> 24:00.564
and you pulled the trigger.

24:02.524 --> 24:04.526
Whatever the truth of the matter is,

24:06.278 --> 24:08.280
Gilbert's the winner in all this.

24:12.409 --> 24:15.579
-You're not frustrated or anything?
-Why would I be?

24:15.662 --> 24:18.665
I mean, isn't that the same
as admitting defeat?

24:19.833 --> 24:22.085
It doesn't matter either way.

24:22.502 --> 24:23.461
You're sure?

24:24.254 --> 24:28.508
Winning and losing were never
very important. Not to me and him.

24:30.635 --> 24:34.139
One sets out a puzzle,
the other solves it. That's all it was.

24:35.473 --> 24:36.766
Nothing more than that.

24:38.977 --> 24:43.356
More importantly, things are gonna get
hectic at work now. The real issue is--

24:47.944 --> 24:50.655
-Koku! Yuna!
-Hi, Lily!

24:50.739 --> 24:52.991
-Where are you going? Want a lift?
-Yes!

24:53.074 --> 24:55.744
-How? There's no room!
-They'll fit!

24:55.827 --> 24:58.246
-We'll fit, Koku!
-We'll never fit.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.332
-We're going to the station!
-We'll fit!

25:00.415 --> 25:02.584
-Let's not go anymore!
-Get in!

26:19.744 --> 26:24.833
Didn't I tell you? This is what you get
when you leave things to a Reggie.

26:27.460 --> 26:28.878
I'll go this time.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.173
I'd like to get my left arm back from him.

26:33.800 --> 26:37.345
Don't mess this up, Kirisame.

26:38.847 --> 26:41.891
I said we'd see each other again soon,
didn't I, Koku?
