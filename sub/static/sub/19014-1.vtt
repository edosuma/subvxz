01:12.031 --> 01:14.498
-Oh, shit.

01:14.533 --> 01:17.501
- Is this the...
Is this the right site?

01:17.536 --> 01:19.770
- Yes, honey.
It's site 16, like always.

01:20.815 --> 01:24.232
- Yo, Tommy, what's going on?
- Will you call me "Dad"?

01:24.268 --> 01:25.743
- Franklin?
- Yeah?

01:25.778 --> 01:28.370
- Are you sure you booked this for us?
- Absolutely.

01:28.405 --> 01:30.781
I booked
the last available site.

01:30.816 --> 01:34.276
I got the permit right here.
Site 16, July 4th weekend.

01:34.311 --> 01:37.054
- Felipa.

01:37.089 --> 01:41.483
- I just think that there's been a
little bit of a mix-up, Papi, so...

01:41.518 --> 01:44.720
- Buenos tardes, amigos!
Word, bitches.

01:44.722 --> 01:46.930
- Who you calling a bitch?
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

01:46.966 --> 01:50.459
Just trying to break up the
racial tension here, that's all.

01:50.494 --> 01:51.193
Might have hit bitch
a little hard.

01:51.228 --> 01:53.070
- A little bit.
- Yeah.

01:53.105 --> 01:57.532
So what's going on? Pretty sure we
booked this site for the weekend.

01:57.568 --> 01:59.368
- No, no. We're the Jones family.
- Yeah.

02:00.471 --> 02:01.812
We booked site 16.

02:01.847 --> 02:06.232
Well, now, we're the Jonas
family and this is our site.

02:06.268 --> 02:09.134
- Son, we're site 16.
- No.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.637
We're site 16.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.473
- You guys might be 116,
but we're definitely 16.

02:13.508 --> 02:14.868
It's right here on the paper,
okay?

02:16.712 --> 02:17.831
- Uno, dos, tres, quatro...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:17.855 --> 02:20.447
- That is level two, sweetheart,
that's nice. This is 16.

02:20.482 --> 02:22.382
- I don't know how that is.
- We're 16.

02:22.417 --> 02:24.417
- Yeah, I know,
but we're site 16.

02:24.453 --> 02:27.129
- 16, man. Come on.
- Hold on. So...

02:27.164 --> 02:30.832
Jones, Jonas, and our last name is
Jones, too. Well, there's the mix-up.

02:30.868 --> 02:33.626
- What y'all trying to say,
y'all our masters or something?

02:33.662 --> 02:36.996
- No, no, not saying...
I barely even own a cat.

02:37.032 --> 02:39.365
-Site 16!

02:39.401 --> 02:40.767
Wait a minute!

02:42.170 --> 02:43.703
-2,000 and 3,000.

02:43.739 --> 02:45.083
But we're definitely 16.
It says here on the paper.

02:45.107 --> 02:47.132
-Also site 16!

02:56.610 --> 03:00.345
- Okay, um, so,
it looks like the name "Jones"

03:00.381 --> 03:03.615
kind of mixed up the computers.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.517
And, uh, unfortunately,
that's a big problem,

03:05.553 --> 03:07.761
because the park
is completely sold out.

03:07.796 --> 03:11.657
I mean, this is, like,
our biggest weekend of the year.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.532
- Hey, maybe it's because
it's the 4th of July.

03:13.835 --> 03:17.036
- Um, yeah, well, you know,
we think that that's a factor.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.792
- Come on, you guys. Please, please,
please, let's not escalate this.

03:20.334 --> 03:23.135
How about sharing the site?

03:26.140 --> 03:28.148
-Everyone stop!

03:28.183 --> 03:30.987
- Ron, you just gonna stand there and
let them push us around like that?

03:31.011 --> 03:33.704
- No, no, I won't let that happen, okay?
Let me tell you something.

03:33.706 --> 03:36.373
I'm gonna have Jesse Jackson
down here on a moped,

03:36.408 --> 03:38.408
with Al Sharpton in the sidecar.

03:38.444 --> 03:40.377
Okay?
They love that type of shit.

03:40.412 --> 03:43.246
- Ooh! It just escalated.
- Yeah.

03:43.282 --> 03:45.023
That definitely escalated,

03:45.059 --> 03:48.719
which was the exact opposite of
what he was hoping you would do.

03:48.721 --> 03:52.798
- Sir, if sharing the site
is the only option, then...

03:55.002 --> 03:58.528
This weekend is important. I say
we all just share the site.

03:58.564 --> 03:59.883
- Uh, son,
are you out of your damn mind?

03:59.907 --> 04:02.387
- Come on, Pop, there's kids here...
- We're not gonna share...

04:08.574 --> 04:10.507
- There's not...
There's not enough space!

04:10.542 --> 04:13.735
- Papi? Are we gonna
have to go home?

04:19.409 --> 04:20.742
Okay. Okay, so... So...

04:22.345 --> 04:26.448
Maybe we can share.
- Yes!

04:26.483 --> 04:28.216
All right,
so we're all gonna share.

04:28.251 --> 04:29.751
And it's gonna be great!

04:38.562 --> 04:40.729
- All right.
Little bit of a rough start,

04:40.731 --> 04:42.108
but this weekend's gonna be great.

04:42.132 --> 04:44.841
Yeah, I hope so.

04:44.877 --> 04:47.302
You know, this is the first
time we've all been together

04:47.337 --> 04:48.979
since you and I got married.

04:49.014 --> 04:52.741
I just want your kids to like my
kids and my kids to like you.

04:52.776 --> 04:56.437
There's no reason we can't be
one big, happy family.

04:56.472 --> 04:58.813
- That speech sucked.
- Sucked balls.

04:58.849 --> 05:03.444
- Wow. -Yeah, yeah, he's right.
It came off really whiny.

05:03.479 --> 05:04.886
I can't believe
that we're brothers.

05:04.921 --> 05:08.716
- Hey, Gravy, why don't you take
these over to the campsite?

05:08.718 --> 05:10.718
- Oh, no, my hands are full.
I gotta go, I gotta...

05:12.655 --> 05:14.032
- Hey, Thomas,
did you unpack my turtle shells?

05:14.056 --> 05:15.756
-Yeah, here.

05:18.561 --> 05:20.835
Can you call me "Dad"?
- Not right now.

05:20.871 --> 05:23.805
Thanks, Tommy. Hey, guys,
check out my new turtle shells!

05:25.234 --> 05:26.975
-Give it time, honey.

05:27.010 --> 05:30.437
Oh, do you think you can get Sharni
to stop calling me "Fake Mom"?

05:30.473 --> 05:31.616
- She doesn't call you
"Fake Mom."

05:31.640 --> 05:33.507
- Oh, you're doing that?
You're doing that?

05:33.542 --> 05:35.182
- Yeah, no, no. I'll try.
- Thank you.

05:37.671 --> 05:41.506
- Man! Sharing this site
was a crap idea, Felipa.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.474
- We're doing this
for Papi's birthday.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.952
Just try to hold it together
for him.

05:44.987 --> 05:47.547
- You think maybe we'll see Papi
smile for once in his damn life?

05:48.682 --> 05:51.717
- He works hard,
and he worries about us.

05:51.719 --> 05:52.971
- What, he can't worry and smile
at the same time?

05:52.995 --> 05:56.964
Hey, I bet if your Papi ever did
smile, his face would creak.

05:56.999 --> 05:59.725
Sound like a nail being pulled from wood.

05:59.727 --> 06:02.803
- We'd probably hear his face go,
"Oilcan! Oilcan!"

06:04.531 --> 06:06.874
- Ha, ha, ha.
Maybe he would smile more

06:06.909 --> 06:09.229
if you stopped goofing around
and went to work for Rolando.

06:11.105 --> 06:12.571
-As a plumber?

06:12.606 --> 06:15.140
Uh, no, Felipa.
That's a living nightmare.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.499
-It's honest work.

06:16.535 --> 06:18.635
- Anyways, look,
it doesn't even matter.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.348
I tell you, one day,
I'm gonna be a millionaire.

06:20.372 --> 06:23.306
-Oh! You gonna win the lottery?

06:23.341 --> 06:25.575
-Won't win if I don't scratch.

06:25.610 --> 06:25.784
Plus, I'm gonna get my ass
on "Shark Tank"

06:25.819 --> 06:28.445
and make Mark Cuban my new best friend.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.766
- Well, when you become
a millionaire,

06:29.790 --> 06:33.550
maybe you could pay me back
the 75 bucks I loaned you.

06:33.585 --> 06:34.771
- Ah! Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah, you're gonna have to

06:34.795 --> 06:37.620
fill out all kinds of paperwork
and taxes and stuff.

06:37.656 --> 06:39.756
Might not be worth it, bro,
so, probably not.

06:42.661 --> 06:46.663
- Hey, did you leave the car open?
- I did.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.566
- Did you see Fake Mom
telling me how to unpack,

06:49.601 --> 06:50.854
like she's the boss of me
or something?

06:50.878 --> 06:54.304
- Hey, babe, Sharni, you
shouldn't call her "Fake Mom."

06:54.339 --> 06:56.673
I'm glad that Dad remarried.

06:56.708 --> 06:59.267
He's much happier,
which keeps him off of my ass.

06:59.302 --> 07:01.703
I think she's great for him.

07:01.705 --> 07:03.747
- Yeah, well, Fake Mom says
you drink too much, too.

07:03.782 --> 07:07.108
- Fake Mom can blow my balls.
She said that? -Yeah.

07:07.143 --> 07:08.143
-That's bullshit.

07:10.447 --> 07:12.747
Is that a 24-hour
Popeye's Chicken?

07:14.350 --> 07:15.750
-Uh, no. That's a Porta Potty.

07:18.455 --> 07:21.089
- I love chickens.
More than you.

07:21.124 --> 07:22.757
-Ah, screw off.

07:27.597 --> 07:29.497
- Whoo! Y'all kids
keep it down over there

07:29.532 --> 07:32.166
with your Pokemon Go
playing selves!

07:32.202 --> 07:32.876
-Girl, you so crazy.

07:32.911 --> 07:37.205
- Girl, I am so tired of running
around after the kids.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.533
I need this vacation.

07:39.568 --> 07:43.537
- It's beautiful here.
- It is, ain't it?

07:43.572 --> 07:46.139
Honey, you gonna like
my brother Franklin.

07:46.175 --> 07:47.708
All I got to say is,

07:47.710 --> 07:50.544
is hold off on having kids
for as long as you can.

07:50.579 --> 07:51.931
'Cause they will suck
the life out of you.

07:51.955 --> 07:55.115
I mean, it's like sticking a vacuum
cleaner in a pumpkin, just...

07:57.720 --> 08:00.654
- What'd you say, Mama?
- Just suck it all... Huh? Huh?

08:00.689 --> 08:04.624
Baby, nothing. Mama loves you.
Go on. Go play.

08:04.660 --> 08:06.560
- Wait. Hold up.
Are you saying you invited me

08:06.595 --> 08:08.528
as some kind of blind date
for Franklin?

08:08.564 --> 08:11.873
- Girl, no, no, no!
We enjoy your company.

08:11.908 --> 08:15.502
- Oh, girl, 'cause I was about to...
- But it is a blind date.

08:15.537 --> 08:18.271
- Hey, Jose,
can you get those oranges?

08:18.307 --> 08:19.781
-Are you kidding, Felipa?

08:19.816 --> 08:21.611
Nothing can give the other
families the satisfaction

08:21.635 --> 08:23.635
of watching a Mexican
carry a bag of oranges.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.603
Like I'm selling them
on the side of the street.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.739
- Okay, are you serious?
God, you sound crazy.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.510
-Hey, excuse me!

08:33.547 --> 08:36.181
How much do you want
for those oranges?

08:36.216 --> 08:37.115
-Ay, beat it, pendejo!

08:37.150 --> 08:38.750
-Oh, crap. Angry.

08:41.587 --> 08:44.188
- Hey, Paco,
you got any roses over there?

08:44.224 --> 08:45.224
-Who asked you, Oprah?

08:48.662 --> 08:50.382
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'll take that one.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.165
Hey, what is that?

08:57.070 --> 08:58.070
In your bag.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.209
Yeah, that. What's...

09:18.316 --> 09:20.750
-Recycled. Glass sculpture.

09:23.321 --> 09:24.401
My exhibit. It's next week.

09:25.657 --> 09:27.537
- What? You have an exhibit?
- It's called...

09:29.094 --> 09:30.094
"The Exhibit."

09:36.009 --> 09:39.635
- Oh, at least there's some chicas
calientes to stare at, huh?

09:39.671 --> 09:41.471
- Jose! What if Francesca
heard you say that?

09:42.540 --> 09:45.400
- She ain't here.
And we ain't married.

09:45.436 --> 09:47.469
Besides,
just 'cause I'm on a diet

09:47.504 --> 09:49.271
doesn't mean
I can't look at the menu.

09:49.306 --> 09:50.439
-You mean stare at the menu?

09:50.474 --> 09:51.834
- Tuck dollar bills
into that menu?

09:52.951 --> 09:55.477
- I mean, come on! Man, she's got
so much wiggle in her walk,

09:55.512 --> 09:58.346
she could butt-dial
a rotary phone.

09:58.382 --> 09:59.622
I heard them talking.

09:59.824 --> 10:03.051
I guess she came as a blind
date for that Franklin guy.

10:03.087 --> 10:04.286
- Word?
- Word.

10:04.321 --> 10:07.289
-What? What'd you just say?

10:07.324 --> 10:08.468
- Are you all right?
- No!

10:08.492 --> 10:10.692
No, no, I'm not all right.

10:10.728 --> 10:12.761
Listening to you two talk
would make anybody sick.

10:15.499 --> 10:17.766
Men are idiots.
Blind date bullshit.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.513
-Don't let her call you that.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.538
- She's talking to you, too,
pendejo.

10:23.574 --> 10:25.218
Is our sister on her menopause
or what?

10:25.242 --> 10:26.242
-Ah! The Jones family!

10:27.102 --> 10:28.201
- Jones!
- Whoa!

10:28.236 --> 10:30.637
Chilluns are everywhere.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.583
- Hey, I really hope you guys
like the park, man.

10:32.607 --> 10:34.507
I don't know what happened
with this mix-up.

10:34.543 --> 10:37.018
I know I booked
the last available site.

10:37.054 --> 10:40.914
- What changed your mind about
coming with us this year, huh, son?

10:40.949 --> 10:42.482
-What?

10:42.517 --> 10:44.860
I love camping.
All this is me, Pops.

10:44.895 --> 10:48.130
- Come on, Franklin. Come on, bro.
That's bullshit, okay?

10:48.165 --> 10:50.977
I hope you know this is not online camping.
It's actually the real thing.

10:51.001 --> 10:54.227
- And I hope you know this won't
be a online fist in your face.

10:54.262 --> 10:56.596
It'll be the real thing.

10:56.631 --> 10:58.665
- You know something?
I'm tired of your shit.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.620
- Ron Ron, stop it.
You leave your brother alone.

11:01.103 --> 11:02.811
-Sorry, Daddy.

11:02.846 --> 11:04.824
- He's gotta dress correct.
He's a District Attorney now.

11:04.848 --> 11:08.433
And he's working his way up.
He might be Mayor one day.

11:08.468 --> 11:09.821
- Ah, I don't know
about Mayor, Pop.

11:09.845 --> 11:14.005
- And, this weekend, we have
a fine young woman with us.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.407
Shantaysia.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.052
- Who's Shantaysia?
- Listen, son.

11:19.087 --> 11:21.848
Beautiful woman like that on your
side, no telling how far you can go.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.250
From DA to Mayor.
Commander-in-chief.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.286
You smell that?

11:28.321 --> 11:29.863
There's romance in the air.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.932
- Y'all smell these potties?
Damn! -I smell something.

11:32.968 --> 11:35.802
But I didn't wanna say nothing,
'cause I kinda thought it was...

11:37.097 --> 11:38.097
-Sorry, Daddy.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.241
Is that Justin Bieber?

11:53.337 --> 11:54.737
Is that guy naked?
- You wish.

11:58.276 --> 11:59.742
-Is that dumpster on fire?

12:03.481 --> 12:04.921
Oh, my gosh.
Is that Charles Bronson?

12:09.220 --> 12:10.220
-What's in the bottle?

12:10.864 --> 12:15.157
- Communion. -Right. So you're
some creepy drunk priest?

12:15.193 --> 12:16.759
-I am not a priest.

12:21.666 --> 12:24.600
- Listen. Why don't you
help Franklin... -No!

12:24.635 --> 12:27.470
Set some things up?

12:27.505 --> 12:29.772
- I've gotta go till some soil.
- Pop!

12:31.134 --> 12:33.535
Shantay... Sharon?

12:33.570 --> 12:36.204
- Shantaysia.
- Damn, they still doing that?

12:36.239 --> 12:37.739
-That's fucked up. Here.

12:39.076 --> 12:41.710
- "Shantaysia."

12:41.712 --> 12:43.792
Come on, what the hell
kind of disease... Shantaysia.

12:44.856 --> 12:47.282
- Hey, bro, what are you doing?
You sleeping in your car?

12:47.317 --> 12:48.824
-Until Denali makes a tent.

12:48.860 --> 12:52.194
- Bro, you is not a real camper.
Huh? You can't fool me.

12:52.230 --> 12:55.657
You might be able to fool Pops, but you
can't fool me, brother. -You're right.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.570
- You can never fool me.
- I don't wanna fool you.

12:57.594 --> 12:58.846
- Since I've known you... Whoa!
- Ah, snake!

12:58.870 --> 13:02.497
- Snake! Snake on your shoulder!
Snake on your shoulder!

13:02.532 --> 13:04.599
- Is it invisible?
I don't see nothing!

13:04.634 --> 13:05.919
Where is it?
- Ron Ron, I'm just...

13:05.943 --> 13:10.371
Ron Ron, I'm just messing with you.
I'm just messing with you!

13:10.407 --> 13:11.706
I'm just messing with you, dawg.

13:11.742 --> 13:13.742
I just... I just... What?
I just, what, fooled you.

13:17.472 --> 13:20.306
Hit those flying bastards!

13:20.341 --> 13:21.485
-Chuckie, don't say "bastard."

13:21.509 --> 13:24.343
- What about bitch?
- Yeah, that's not...

13:24.379 --> 13:25.745
- Ass Slurpee?
- No. That... No.

13:27.282 --> 13:28.314
- Ass waffle!
- Not great.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.183
- Bitch taco?
- Don't love it.

13:30.218 --> 13:31.317
- Shit Slurpee?
- No.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.386
- Crap-talker.
- I don't... No.

13:33.421 --> 13:34.896
- Ass-butch?
- Don't... Not a fan.

13:34.931 --> 13:37.690
- You love tit chicken. Tell me that.
- No, I don't love that.

13:37.726 --> 13:39.670
- I kinda like that.
- I don't love the word "tit."

13:39.694 --> 13:41.138
- Come on now. Dick dog?
- Definitely not "dick."

13:41.162 --> 13:42.128
- Ass lick?
- No.

13:42.163 --> 13:44.197
- Slurpee?
- No.

13:44.232 --> 13:47.366
- Shit Slurpee!
- No.

13:47.402 --> 13:49.068
- What else you got?
- Bastards!

13:49.104 --> 13:50.336
- Mmm...
- Mmm.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.338
You know what, bastard's fine.

13:52.373 --> 13:55.566
- It's... It's passable.
- Yeah.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.346
Hey, everybody, look!

13:57.370 --> 13:59.003
- I made Ocho into a turtle dog!

14:00.573 --> 14:03.082
- It's the fifth Ninja Turtle,
Taco Bello.

14:03.118 --> 14:06.444
Ha, ha, ha, yeah. It's
totally funny, man. Now take it off.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.919
- I can't.
- It's super-glued.

14:22.161 --> 14:23.761
-Is that Tejano?

14:27.500 --> 14:30.334
- Now this is what
I'm talking about.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.770
Jazz on the stereo, cozy fire.

14:34.273 --> 14:35.114
-Dad, look, no offense,

14:35.150 --> 14:38.310
but this old-ass music make me wanna
put a gun to my head and shoot it!

14:39.271 --> 14:40.311
- Give me a sec.

14:41.239 --> 14:42.138
I'm gonna go get a gun.

14:42.174 --> 14:44.140
-Ha! Good one, Pop.

14:44.176 --> 14:45.742
When?

14:47.079 --> 14:48.111
- When?
- When?

14:48.146 --> 14:50.313
-When? When what?

14:50.348 --> 14:51.147
- I don't even know.
- What?

14:51.183 --> 14:52.890
-No, no, no, no, no.

14:52.925 --> 14:56.119
You said someday someone's gonna
have an intervention on you.

14:56.154 --> 14:58.421
I'm curious. When?

14:58.457 --> 15:00.423
- She wasn't suppo...
I mean, uh...

15:00.459 --> 15:01.024
- When?
- What is she talking about?

15:01.059 --> 15:02.933
-Wait, what?

15:02.969 --> 15:05.047
I love that show, "Intervention."
- What is she talking about?

15:05.071 --> 15:07.872
- I'm camping with my son and my
daughter, we're having a good time.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.347
- The wieners... -I don't even
know where this is coming from.

15:11.703 --> 15:15.538
- My brother's coherent, and...
- I love it here.

15:15.574 --> 15:17.051
- This is fabulous.
- It's great.

15:17.075 --> 15:18.499
-Yeah, it...

15:18.535 --> 15:20.568
- Until I hear things
about interventions.

15:20.603 --> 15:23.204
When might this intervention
be happening?

15:23.239 --> 15:25.039
-What you talking about?

15:25.075 --> 15:28.242
-Uh, son, uh...

15:28.278 --> 15:29.853
When this wiener is done.

15:29.888 --> 15:31.866
- When will it be done?
- Yeah, it will be done!

15:31.890 --> 15:35.516
- Well, let me just tell you
that interventions are not cool.

15:35.552 --> 15:36.838
They sprung one
on a buddy of mine once

15:36.862 --> 15:38.773
and I'm pretty sure he stabbed
a bunch of his mom's cats.

15:38.797 --> 15:42.523
- The vet probably had
a really good night that night,

15:42.559 --> 15:44.479
wondering how all those cats
got stabbed.

15:48.598 --> 15:50.631
- One of these days,
I'm gonna be so rich,

15:50.667 --> 15:52.344
I'll be able to rent
this whole damn park out.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.448
Maybe then Papi will smile.

15:55.004 --> 15:57.572
Oh, hey.

15:57.607 --> 15:59.440
I just had my best
million-dollar idea yet.

15:59.476 --> 16:00.796
It's a soft drink, but for dogs.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.104
It's called "Pupsi."
- What?

16:05.139 --> 16:06.139
- Pupsi!
- Pupsi?

16:07.675 --> 16:08.761
Pepsi's not gonna let you
get away with that.

16:08.785 --> 16:13.512
- What are they gonna do, sue me?
- Yeah. Out your ass.

16:13.548 --> 16:16.749
- ♪ That's a bad idea
called Pupsi ♪

16:18.286 --> 16:19.752
-You fools have no vision.

16:23.124 --> 16:25.458
-♪ Pupsi... ♪

16:25.493 --> 16:27.259
- Who made y'all the DJ
of site 16?

16:27.295 --> 16:29.595
Turn that shit down, okay?

16:29.630 --> 16:31.350
We're trying to hear
old-ass jazz over here.

16:33.267 --> 16:35.009
-Look at they fire, huh?

16:35.044 --> 16:37.879
We got this little fire right here.
This doesn't make any sense.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.354
- What does it matter if their
fire is bigger than our fire?

16:41.435 --> 16:43.168
- It don't matter...
- Thank you.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.736
- if it ain't true.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.135
- Hey, are their fires
bigger than ours?

16:52.379 --> 16:53.659
You know, we need a bigger fire.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.050
Get that lighter fluid.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.200
-Want some of this?

17:27.204 --> 17:28.738
-Hey, what you doing?

17:32.277 --> 17:33.743
-What's wrong with y'all?

17:36.514 --> 17:39.348
- What the hell is wrong
with you men?

17:39.384 --> 17:41.350
Y'all trying to burn my babies?

17:41.386 --> 17:42.318
- Tell 'em, baby.
- Oh, my God!

17:42.353 --> 17:44.520
-What is wrong with you guys?

17:44.556 --> 17:46.196
- Yell at them.
Yell at them a little bit.

17:47.325 --> 17:47.990
- What the hell?
- Felipe!

17:48.026 --> 17:50.034
-Cool off!

17:50.070 --> 17:52.910
My babies in there sleeping, you
know you got that from Vietnam.

17:53.364 --> 17:54.408
-Why would you burn that shit?

17:54.432 --> 17:56.532
- Hey!
- The fire's still burning.

17:56.568 --> 17:59.736
They started it.
- Okay, come on, really?

17:59.738 --> 18:01.938
- We had it under control.
The ice was under control.

18:01.973 --> 18:03.372
Baby...

18:03.408 --> 18:04.732
-Yeah, you can't fuel this fire!

18:14.177 --> 18:15.376
-What are you doing?

18:15.411 --> 18:17.511
- Go to bed!
Everybody go to bed.

18:17.547 --> 18:19.447
- I was actually sleeping.
- Go to bed!

18:19.482 --> 18:20.526
- I was sleepy.
I was gonna go to bed.

18:20.550 --> 18:22.110
I was thinking
it was time to go to bed.

18:33.162 --> 18:35.162
This is bullshit!

18:35.198 --> 18:36.773
Getting eaten alive!

18:36.808 --> 18:40.234
Damn ants or mosquitoes
or whatever the hell you are.

18:40.269 --> 18:41.269
Leave me alone!

18:47.535 --> 18:49.735
There's gotta be
a 24-hour place in town.

18:52.039 --> 18:53.739
Oh, my God.

18:56.277 --> 18:57.743
What a fricking beginning.

19:10.257 --> 19:11.257
-What the hell was that?

19:12.126 --> 19:13.759
Fricking pina...

19:15.529 --> 19:17.089
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

19:18.165 --> 19:20.699
-What did you do?

19:20.735 --> 19:22.612
- You scared the crap outta me!
- Oh, my goodness.

19:22.636 --> 19:25.604
Okay, okay,
this is not what it looks like.

19:25.639 --> 19:26.792
- You killed them both?
- No, no, no, no, no!

19:26.816 --> 19:32.637
This piece of shit dumbass
hybrid makes no noise, and...

19:32.672 --> 19:35.606
All right. You gotta help me
get them to a vet.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.219
You drive and I'll give them
mouth-to-mouth.

19:37.243 --> 19:38.743
I mean, mouth-to-snout.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.898
- What the hell did
they do to Ocho?

20:01.301 --> 20:02.341
Who would do such a thing?

20:06.206 --> 20:07.772
- Them...
- Come on.

20:11.202 --> 20:13.502
-Hey, man. Hey! What?

20:13.538 --> 20:14.070
- What the heck did you do
to our dog?

20:14.105 --> 20:14.879
Look.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.306
- Nobody do nothin' to your dog.
What are you talking about?

20:17.341 --> 20:19.241
-What do you mean do nothin'?

20:19.277 --> 20:21.711
Oh, shit. Chaka!

20:21.713 --> 20:23.833
- What did they do to you?
- What happened to my baby?

20:24.515 --> 20:25.715
What did you'll try
to do to my baby?

20:25.717 --> 20:27.628
- Hey, man, we didn't touch
your dog. You busted ours.

20:27.652 --> 20:29.952
- Yeah, we love dogs, man.
- Look at our dog.

20:29.987 --> 20:30.895
It's...

20:30.930 --> 20:33.330
If y'all didn't touch our dog
and we didn't touch your dog...

20:35.326 --> 20:36.759
Wake up, white people.

20:39.731 --> 20:42.131
- Okay, all right, heh...
Just... Just hear me out.

20:42.166 --> 20:44.333
I am so... sorry.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.768
It was an accident.

20:47.739 --> 20:49.259
I swear. I
I just wanted some Benadryl.

20:55.404 --> 20:56.236
- Crazy white man.
- What, man?

20:56.272 --> 20:59.073
- I have no idea.

21:04.547 --> 21:06.513
Come on, man,
what are you doing?

21:06.549 --> 21:07.281
I want a freakin' refund
or something.

21:07.316 --> 21:08.482
-They seem pretty worked up.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.584
- Yeah, if this turns
into a race war,

21:10.619 --> 21:12.753
we'll be pulling out paperwork
for a decade.

21:26.102 --> 21:27.102
You people...

21:29.705 --> 21:32.673
This is the 4th of July.
This is the day we honor

21:32.708 --> 21:36.235
how our great nation declared
its independence

21:36.271 --> 21:37.271
from the king of England.

21:39.708 --> 21:42.816
Do you happen to even know
how George Washington

21:42.852 --> 21:47.213
celebrated his final victory
over the British at Yorktown?

21:47.248 --> 21:49.615
That day great day, hmm?

21:49.651 --> 21:52.752
He issued his troops,
a double ration of rum.

21:56.224 --> 21:58.658
Here we are. We had...

21:58.693 --> 22:01.761
fought this bitter war
against a tyrannical foe.

22:04.733 --> 22:07.533
And, all we did to celebrate it,
is that we drank.

22:07.569 --> 22:10.002
Four fingers of booze.
Instead of two.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.687
That's about a martini
and a half.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.723
In case you were wondering
what four fingers was.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.559
Today...

22:41.594 --> 22:43.694
If a kid happens to throw
his poopy diaper

22:43.730 --> 22:45.905
into the hamper, the parents,
they go ape-shit,

22:45.940 --> 22:48.300
and they throw the kid a party,
and give him a PlayStation.

22:53.473 --> 22:54.833
Gosh, he drinks like me.

22:59.904 --> 23:00.904
Aah!

23:05.209 --> 23:08.610
-I don't really see...

23:08.646 --> 23:10.524
This issue between you people
as a problem.

23:10.548 --> 23:13.515
I see it as an opportunity
to get away

23:13.551 --> 23:14.837
from what the 4th of July
has become.

23:14.861 --> 23:19.221
Which, let's face it, is just
a couple of days off work

23:19.256 --> 23:19.764
for all the lazy people.

23:19.799 --> 23:26.595
We have become a nation
of soft, puffy, pussy people.

23:26.630 --> 23:28.241
And, we have forgotten
the sacrifice of those

23:28.265 --> 23:29.807
who have come before us.

23:29.842 --> 23:33.811
And, so, in my opinion,
whoever wants camping site 16...

23:35.639 --> 23:36.925
you're gonna have to fuckin'
fight for it.

23:36.949 --> 23:41.301
- Wait a minute, you're talking
about cannons, muskets and shit?

23:41.336 --> 23:43.537
- You're crazy.
- Mm-hmm.

23:43.572 --> 23:46.440
- Hey, I am retiring in a week
and a half,

23:46.475 --> 23:48.642
and I don't give a shit,
all right?

23:48.677 --> 23:52.079
You don't have to use guns
and knives. Just...

23:52.114 --> 23:53.080
Have a contest.

23:53.115 --> 23:55.415
Have a contest.

23:55.451 --> 23:57.893
Whatever family
wins the contest,

23:57.928 --> 24:01.088
they get to kick the other two
families' asses outta the park.

24:01.123 --> 24:02.622
How about that?

24:02.658 --> 24:04.833
You get no cheese
with your wine around here.

24:04.869 --> 24:09.062
So, if I were you, I would be
dedicated to gettin' it on.

24:09.098 --> 24:10.764
Cause it's on.

24:13.811 --> 24:17.671
This whole thing is a mess,
and we're sorry about it.

24:17.706 --> 24:20.499
We were told to help out
with the contest, and...

24:20.535 --> 24:21.786
It was the park's fault.
- Well, great.

24:21.810 --> 24:26.372
- Wow. It's really nice that
the pigs are being helpful.

24:26.407 --> 24:27.759
- Pardon?
- Uh, no, nothing.

24:27.783 --> 24:31.210
He just said that the cloud
up there looks like a pig.

24:31.245 --> 24:32.978
-No, I didn't. I said...

24:35.683 --> 24:37.161
- He, uh... He had a spider
on his zipper there.

24:37.185 --> 24:38.751
- Thanks!

24:41.355 --> 24:43.656
- Thanks, guys.
Hey, Gravy.

24:43.691 --> 24:46.459
- He deserved that.
- Yeah, seriously.

24:46.494 --> 24:49.295
- So, we're doing
this contest thing?

24:49.330 --> 24:50.563
-Oh, yeah, we're doing this.

24:50.598 --> 24:53.032
What's the matter, old man?
You scared?

24:53.067 --> 24:55.134
-Scared? No.

24:55.169 --> 24:57.536
Just sad.
- Oh!

24:57.572 --> 24:59.939
Sad for you
and all these other losers.

24:59.974 --> 25:01.674
-Kids.

25:01.709 --> 25:03.512
We're marking off an area
for you to play in.

25:03.536 --> 25:05.436
Do not leave this area
for any reason.

25:05.471 --> 25:07.004
- What if we get hit
by lightning?

25:07.039 --> 25:08.439
-Try not to.

25:08.474 --> 25:10.174
- What if we see
an ice cream truck?

25:10.209 --> 25:12.409
- Try not to.
- Dad?

25:12.445 --> 25:13.764
How long do we have to
stay here?

25:13.788 --> 25:16.480
- Just while the adults are off,
doing adult things.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.995
- Yes, I'm getting
a new baby brother.

25:18.951 --> 25:21.351
-Uh...

25:21.387 --> 25:24.088
Not those kind of adult things.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.991
- Okay, kids, have fun.
Hey, don't poke your eyes out.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.027
Peace out.

25:34.333 --> 25:35.333
Hi.

25:37.303 --> 25:38.769
Oh, hmm...

25:42.817 --> 25:45.467
- I don't know what to say.
- Well, you can usually find

25:45.502 --> 25:47.911
all the right words
in the courtroom.

25:47.947 --> 25:51.506
- I thought bringing our families
together up here, would be...

25:51.542 --> 25:54.376
our chance to, you know,
break the news.

25:54.411 --> 25:55.744
- Wait...
You did this on purpose?

25:58.315 --> 26:00.716
-Yeah, kinda, a little bit.

26:00.718 --> 26:03.051
I mean, it was easy
'cause our names are so similar.

26:03.087 --> 26:05.654
Jones. Jonas.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.831
I didn't expect
a white Jones family to show up.

26:07.867 --> 26:11.359
Man, I screwed up everything.
It's my fault, I'm sorry.

26:11.395 --> 26:15.363
- So, who is she?
- Who is who?

26:15.399 --> 26:17.532
-You know who I'm talking about.

26:17.568 --> 26:19.701
- Who, Fantasia?
I don't know that girl.

26:19.737 --> 26:22.170
- Shantaysia, why is she here?
- I don't know her.

26:22.206 --> 26:23.772
She's my dad's idea.

26:25.668 --> 26:26.033
I don't... It's my first time
ever seeing her.

26:26.069 --> 26:27.735
Stop. Come on.

26:29.338 --> 26:30.738
You know I love you.
Stop.

26:34.310 --> 26:36.744
Anyway, look, I have a plan.

26:39.382 --> 26:40.922
I'll make sure we win the race.

26:40.958 --> 26:45.519
And, then, I'll convince my dad
to let you... your family stay,

26:45.555 --> 26:46.153
and we'll get rid of
the white family.

26:46.189 --> 26:47.755
They'll kick rocks.

26:49.425 --> 26:50.991
- What if your family
doesn't win?

26:51.027 --> 26:53.160
-Felipa...

26:53.196 --> 26:55.763
Stop smoking crack.

26:57.366 --> 26:58.766
We're black, we're gonna win.

26:59.843 --> 27:03.304
Mexicans are pretty athletic,
too. What about like...

27:03.339 --> 27:05.706
Big Papi.
- He's Dominican.

27:05.742 --> 27:07.733
Oh, y'all gonna lose bad.
Y'all gonna lose so bad.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.746
- Hey, guys, I think I hear
an ice cream truck.

27:23.517 --> 27:25.451
- Wait, but,
we can't leave this area.

27:25.486 --> 27:27.086
- Well, screw that,
it's ice cream.

27:36.330 --> 27:38.197
Look at these people.

27:38.232 --> 27:39.940
They're like vultures.

27:39.976 --> 27:43.669
- They're standing around watching
us fight among ourselves.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.904
- Don't think they're just
out here having fun?

27:45.940 --> 27:46.814
-No.

27:46.849 --> 27:50.534
This has gotten much bigger
than three mad-ass families.

27:50.569 --> 27:53.670
- Bigger how?
- Oh, you think about it, bud.

27:53.706 --> 27:55.906
International sports, you root
for your country.

27:55.941 --> 27:57.507
-Yeah.

27:57.543 --> 27:57.908
- School sports, you root
for your school.

27:57.943 --> 28:00.544
-Yeah.

28:00.579 --> 28:02.679
- These people are rooting
for their race.

28:02.715 --> 28:06.683
- Oh, you don't know that.
- Okay. Truth or dare?

28:06.719 --> 28:09.152
I'll answer a question,
if you answer a question.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.253
- Okay.
- Truthfully.

28:10.289 --> 28:11.455
- All right.
- All right.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.623
Now, when you first
drove up here,

28:13.659 --> 28:14.778
and you saw that
there were two families here.

28:14.802 --> 28:18.562
Now, were you mad cause
there were two families here?

28:18.597 --> 28:21.531
Or, were you mad cause
we weren't white?

28:21.567 --> 28:24.634
- Yeah, well, you know...
Truth be told

28:24.670 --> 28:26.703
when I drove up here,
I was a little nervous.

28:26.739 --> 28:27.824
But, that's because
I didn't know what to expect.

28:27.848 --> 28:32.233
- Well, I felt the same way.
And, that's textbook racism.

28:32.269 --> 28:33.568
-You can't say I'm racist

28:33.603 --> 28:35.570
just because I didn't know
what to expect.

28:35.605 --> 28:37.405
I've had a lot of
great experiences with...

28:37.441 --> 28:39.641
other races,
and some not so great.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.421
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help but overhear.

28:41.445 --> 28:44.612
You should know that...

28:44.648 --> 28:48.683
our family isn't anything
like that at all.

28:48.719 --> 28:51.519
In fact, I was a total wigger
back in high school.

28:51.555 --> 28:52.565
I had my hair braided
and everything.

28:52.589 --> 28:54.309
You remember that?
- Yeah, that was so cute.

28:55.158 --> 28:56.158
-What is a wigger?

29:01.531 --> 29:03.498
- It's just a term
for a kid that's...

29:03.533 --> 29:06.434
trying to act tough
and sound cool.

29:06.470 --> 29:07.936
- Well, now,
that's what it means.

29:07.971 --> 29:09.537
But...

29:09.573 --> 29:12.232
What is it an acronym for?
- An acronym?

29:12.268 --> 29:14.601
-Yeah, like the word smog.

29:14.637 --> 29:17.104
It's a combination of the words
smoke and fog.

29:17.139 --> 29:18.672
That's an acronym.

29:18.708 --> 29:22.743
What are the words that wigger
is an acronym for?

29:24.146 --> 29:25.787
Well, that's easy.

29:25.822 --> 29:29.791
It's a... It's a combination of,
a mash up, if you will,

29:31.287 --> 29:32.753
of the words...

29:35.991 --> 29:37.124
white...

29:37.159 --> 29:38.759
- White.
- And...

29:42.965 --> 29:44.932
er...

29:44.967 --> 29:45.967
-Okay.

29:47.603 --> 29:50.370
I mean, you know,
you guys get hit with...

29:50.406 --> 29:53.373
- honky, hick, crackers,
- Hey!

29:53.409 --> 29:55.434
- Peckerwood, redneck,
- Hey!

29:55.469 --> 29:57.845
- White bastards, white devils.
- Hey!

29:57.880 --> 30:01.882
- But, the "N" word, that cuts
straight through the clutter.

30:01.917 --> 30:04.054
- Yeah, well, once you say that,
it's pretty much game over.

30:04.078 --> 30:05.078
You're right.

30:06.647 --> 30:08.856
- Good going, son. Well done.
- Happy to help.

30:08.891 --> 30:11.516
- But, I still don't agree with
you these people round here

30:11.552 --> 30:13.087
are rooting for their own races.
- Hey!

30:18.292 --> 30:19.292
We got this, baby.

30:20.728 --> 30:22.272
Black and white going down
like a knocked-out zebra.

30:22.296 --> 30:24.429
Yeah, maybe you're right.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.110
- I hear it, I hear it.
- Ice cream.

30:33.140 --> 30:34.782
Ice cream!

30:34.817 --> 30:39.302
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Hey, Franklin. All right. Mmm.

30:39.337 --> 30:41.471
You know, I love that look...

30:41.506 --> 30:43.273
That gleam of victory
in your eyes.

30:43.308 --> 30:45.575
-Yeah, we about to win, Pop.

30:45.610 --> 30:45.784
And, we gonna kick a family
up outta here.

30:45.819 --> 30:49.788
- Oh, yes. That's right.
You know... Where's Shantaysia?

30:49.823 --> 30:53.759
Shantaysia...
You know that old Franklin here

30:53.794 --> 30:58.655
was a track star in high school.
Shantaysia, come on.

30:58.690 --> 31:02.492
- One time, I ate 37 eggs
in six minutes, come on.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.694
I mean that's impossible,
you know.

31:04.730 --> 31:05.882
You proud of me, Daddy?
You gonna brag about that?

31:05.906 --> 31:08.807
- Proud of you, son. Not as proud
as I am of Franklin here.

31:10.469 --> 31:12.502
- What?
- That was a joke.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.938
- He's messing with you.
- Shitty joke.

31:14.973 --> 31:16.873
-What?

31:16.908 --> 31:20.469
- I said Keko's titty is broke.
- Yeah, I thought you said that.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.746
- Let's do this.
- Uh, you know what...

31:22.781 --> 31:25.052
Y'all enjoy your pissing contest
but I'm outta here.

31:25.076 --> 31:26.408
-You wanna go?

31:26.444 --> 31:28.143
- Yeah, I wanna
go find Shantaysia.

31:28.179 --> 31:28.818
Keko, Felipa.

31:28.854 --> 31:33.048
- This is our contest pick
and it's called the Potty Carry.

31:33.084 --> 31:34.450
That's right.

31:34.485 --> 31:37.252
One person goes inside
of each one

31:37.288 --> 31:39.254
and the rest of us carry.

31:39.290 --> 31:40.522
And, the winner is the one

31:40.558 --> 31:43.492
who gets across
that finish line first.

31:43.527 --> 31:45.694
- That finish line
is pretty far, man.

31:45.730 --> 31:47.574
- Dude, don't sweat it, man.
We totally got this.

31:47.598 --> 31:49.009
Mexicans are gonna take
this hands down.

31:49.033 --> 31:50.840
Hey, Papi.

31:50.876 --> 31:53.157
Papi, we're about to start
the race, you gonna come cheer?

31:55.306 --> 31:57.372
-Does your dad ever smile?

31:57.408 --> 31:58.899
- No.
- You mean, "Darth Valdez"?

31:58.934 --> 32:00.434
-Huh.

32:00.469 --> 32:02.703
- Does he even know
what a smile is?

32:02.705 --> 32:04.582
- I bet you, he can't say
the word "Chuck E. Cheese."

32:04.606 --> 32:06.815
Bet you his face makes him
stop at "Chuck."

32:06.851 --> 32:10.444
- He'd probably need a fake ID
just to buy a "Happy Meal."

32:10.479 --> 32:12.579
- Wow. That's good.
- All right.

32:12.614 --> 32:13.867
All right. That's pretty funny,
but, uh...

32:13.891 --> 32:16.792
You know, he's still my dad,
so could you cut it out, please.

32:16.827 --> 32:18.839
- Well, you know, come on,
let's space these potties out,

32:18.863 --> 32:21.764
and get the race started.
I mean, we're standing around...

32:21.799 --> 32:24.424
Let me just drag this one.
Get outta the way, would ya?

32:24.460 --> 32:26.693
Okay.
So, I'll just take this one.

32:26.729 --> 32:28.695
- Are you sure, Dad?
These things are kinda heavy.

32:28.731 --> 32:29.950
- Charlie, I've been a fireman
for years, you know.

32:29.974 --> 32:34.501
I've rescued babies from windows
and fiery buildings, you know.

32:34.536 --> 32:36.369
Come on.
Come on, put this on my back.

32:36.405 --> 32:38.505
- I guess.
- Come on, let's go.

32:38.540 --> 32:40.180
This is... I can just...
I got this.

32:45.605 --> 32:48.640
Charlie, get it off of me.
Get it off of me.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.742
We got this. We got this, Dad.

32:58.385 --> 33:00.351
-Yeah, maybe we should slide it.

33:14.601 --> 33:16.768
- I don't like this.
I'm having a bad day.

33:18.438 --> 33:21.732
I hate kids.
You ruined my life.

33:28.374 --> 33:29.518
The main problem is

33:29.542 --> 33:31.408
is getting this potty
over the ravine.

33:31.444 --> 33:34.011
But, luckily,
Ron Ron got an idea.

33:34.046 --> 33:34.753
What?

33:34.788 --> 33:38.549
- All we need to do is swing
this potty by using rope.

33:38.584 --> 33:39.836
We need to put the rope
through a hitch,

33:39.860 --> 33:43.654
on top of the potty and, then,
toss the rope on branches.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.333
And, then, we swing the potty
over the ravine.

33:45.357 --> 33:48.692
Come on.
- That's a good idea.

33:48.728 --> 33:51.428
We gotta get some rope.
- Oh, Daddy, look at this.

33:51.464 --> 33:52.196
I already got it.
Taken care of.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.597
- Look at that.
- Crap.

33:53.632 --> 33:54.910
- Guess I'm smarter
than Franklin now, right?

33:54.934 --> 33:57.634
-No.

33:57.670 --> 33:58.469
- He's right, man.
Rope's gonna make it easier.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.304
- Sharni, get a rope.
- Okay, got it.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.506
- Dad.
- We're ready to go.

34:02.541 --> 34:03.552
- We can't wait.
- No, no, don't start.

34:03.576 --> 34:05.378
- Come on, let's get started.
- Wait, wait.

34:05.402 --> 34:06.234
- Wait, wait.
- Get on your marks,

34:06.270 --> 34:08.469
get set, go!
- Wait, wait.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.781
Oh, come on.

34:10.815 --> 34:13.708
Uh-uh, keep dreamin'
Blondie, that rope is mine.

34:13.710 --> 34:15.831
- No, I saw it first.
- Hello, open up.

34:17.447 --> 34:18.658
We wanna borrow
your clothes line.

34:18.681 --> 34:21.116
- This is kinda cute.
- Open up. We wanna borrow...

34:21.150 --> 34:22.384
your clothes line.

34:22.418 --> 34:23.463
- Yeah, you know, keep knocking.

34:23.487 --> 34:25.487
People love Mexicans
at their door.

34:25.522 --> 34:26.933
- Ha-ha, really funny,
"Blow White."

34:26.956 --> 34:29.725
Hello.

34:29.726 --> 34:31.847
Gonna see how much you laugh
when the rope is mine.

34:32.496 --> 34:34.596
- Hey, what are you doing
up there?

34:34.630 --> 34:36.764
- Getting this damn clothes line.
- Oh, shit.

34:47.202 --> 34:49.436
I don't know.

34:53.817 --> 34:56.109
- Come this way.
- What the hell was that?

35:01.516 --> 35:03.076
Hey, where did everybody go?

35:03.919 --> 35:04.919
Pop?

35:05.987 --> 35:06.987
Ron Ron?

35:08.056 --> 35:10.724
Did we win?

35:10.726 --> 35:13.226
Come on, come on.

35:13.261 --> 35:14.461
What happened?

35:14.496 --> 35:16.262
- He has a TV antenna stuck
in him.

35:16.298 --> 35:18.598
Where?

35:18.633 --> 35:20.344
We need to take him
to a hospital.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.534
-All right, let's use my car.

35:21.570 --> 35:23.330
- Wait, wait, we're gonna
get him in that?

35:25.107 --> 35:26.107
Here.

35:28.635 --> 35:30.513
- What in the hell
are you doing?

35:30.537 --> 35:32.137
- Bactine. It stings
like a bitch, but...

35:34.407 --> 35:36.074
- No! No more,
you fucking idiot.

35:38.611 --> 35:40.745
Everybody, stop!

35:42.315 --> 35:43.448
-Do you get the NFL package?

35:46.720 --> 35:48.397
We're not gonna
get him in that pussy car.

35:48.421 --> 35:49.754
- Let's get him
in Franklin's car.

35:51.658 --> 35:53.235
- I'm right here.
- Come on.

35:53.259 --> 35:55.660
You got it. You got it.

35:55.695 --> 35:58.463
- Put him inside.
- There you go.

35:58.498 --> 35:59.397
Let's give him a push.
- All right.

35:59.432 --> 36:01.365
- One, two...
- No...

36:01.401 --> 36:02.767
three.

36:07.307 --> 36:08.272
-That went horribly wrong.

36:08.308 --> 36:10.534
Yeah, hang tight.

36:10.569 --> 36:12.169
- Okay, okay. Let's go.
Come on. Vamanos.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.225
- So, are you doing
number one or number two?

36:24.249 --> 36:26.174
-What? Go get an adult.

36:26.209 --> 36:27.718
-You look like a pinata.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.431
- And, you look the first
person's ass I'm gonna beat

36:29.455 --> 36:30.795
if you don't go
and get an adult.

36:30.830 --> 36:32.775
- I didn't say you were one,
I said you looked like one.

36:32.799 --> 36:36.259
- Oh, I'mma beat you so bad
and you're not even my kid.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.528
-Woah, take it easy, perv.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.363
- I thought you kids were
on lock down.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.666
How did you get outta your area?

36:42.701 --> 36:44.579
- You didn't answer me.
Number one or number two?

36:44.603 --> 36:47.270
- Why you wanna know?
Chuckie, that's nasty.

36:47.306 --> 36:49.206
Get an adult, I could die.

36:49.241 --> 36:50.340
- No, no.
- Okay, yeah.

36:50.375 --> 36:54.602
-Please, this is not a drill.

36:54.638 --> 36:55.757
This is a "code red."
You know a "code red."..

36:55.781 --> 36:58.606
Oh, y'all went to public school.
Y'all know nothing.

36:58.642 --> 37:02.744
Oh, my God. I hate kids.
And, I hate camping.

37:13.799 --> 37:15.999
- Hey guys, quick.
- Come say hi to Mom. Come on.

37:18.328 --> 37:20.161
- Hey, Mom.
- Cheese.

37:20.197 --> 37:21.763
-Yo. Yep, I'm good.

37:25.135 --> 37:26.768
Yo, I got lucky.

37:28.338 --> 37:29.771
It was tough, but I'm good.

37:33.935 --> 37:36.703
Hey...

37:36.705 --> 37:38.745
Doctor said my love handles
are like a teenager's.

37:44.312 --> 37:46.479
Yeah, don't worry about it.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.034
Just gonna be here
by myself, you know.

37:50.218 --> 37:51.218
No family to talk to.

37:55.423 --> 37:56.703
- Something
to think about, Mijo.

38:06.601 --> 38:09.435
- Okay.
- Aunt Felipa, I can't move.

38:09.471 --> 38:11.771
- Yes, but you're safe.
Have fun.

38:13.274 --> 38:17.569
- Mind if I sit.
- Sure.

38:17.604 --> 38:19.738
- It's a pretty mantis.
- I'm gonna kill him.

38:22.443 --> 38:23.843
- You know,
the kids don't see race.

38:24.712 --> 38:26.872
- It's true. Seems they learn it
from the adults.

38:28.315 --> 38:30.615
Kids can be a handful, man.

38:30.651 --> 38:31.936
I used to think that
I wanted a bunch of them,

38:31.960 --> 38:34.794
but after this weekend, I think
I'm just gonna get another cat.

38:36.223 --> 38:37.223
Hey where is it?

38:38.625 --> 38:39.636
It's right there,
it's just moving.

38:39.660 --> 38:41.560
- Now, that's a...
- It's a praying...

38:41.595 --> 38:43.770
It's just a gross bug.
Just put it down.

38:43.805 --> 38:46.331
Oh, you know, I've actually
been meaning to tell you,

38:46.366 --> 38:47.232
that I really like your hair.

38:47.267 --> 38:50.368
-Thanks, I do it myself.

38:50.404 --> 38:51.644
- Really?
- I have my own salon.

38:52.206 --> 38:53.880
-That's super cool.

38:53.915 --> 38:58.201
Didn't I hear Charlie saying
that he has his own salon, too.

38:58.236 --> 38:59.903
-Not a salon, a saloon.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.571
-Okay.

39:01.606 --> 39:02.859
- I drove with him to
the vet the other night.

39:02.883 --> 39:06.209
He had a dog under each arm,
giving them both mouth-to-mouth.

39:06.244 --> 39:08.445
He's got a lot of heart.

39:08.480 --> 39:11.548
- Yeah, and dog breath,
sounds like.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.483
Did any of the dogs get
a contact drunk?

39:13.518 --> 39:15.318
- Yeah, I think the dogs
were wondering

39:15.353 --> 39:16.553
why I kept checking their IDs.

39:21.802 --> 39:25.395
You know, he's a good guy.
- Yeah, and cute too, right?

39:25.430 --> 39:28.698
- Yeah, he is kinda cute.
- Yeah.

39:28.734 --> 39:31.468
- Super cute. Like I would.
- I think I would, too.

39:31.503 --> 39:33.236
- Seriously, he's a bit
of a charmer

39:33.271 --> 39:34.471
and girls love bad boys.

39:34.506 --> 39:36.439
- I think he knows
he has a problem.

39:36.475 --> 39:39.634
I don't drink.
I never have, but...

39:39.669 --> 39:42.603
My dad was an alcoholic,
so, I know the signs.

39:42.639 --> 39:44.639
- I really wanna kill it.
- Just kill it.

39:44.674 --> 39:48.176
- No, it's one of God's
creatures, don't kill it.

39:48.211 --> 39:49.211
Right? Don't kill it.

39:51.181 --> 39:53.681
-So, how about you?

39:53.717 --> 39:55.261
Do you work at the courthouse
back in the city?

39:55.285 --> 39:57.452
-Yeah, I'm a stenographer.

39:57.487 --> 39:59.153
- Franklin works
in the DA's office.

39:59.189 --> 40:00.455
- Does he?
- Yeah.

40:00.490 --> 40:01.634
Do you ever see him
around there?

40:01.658 --> 40:03.758
Uh... Now that you...
I think I have. Mm-hmm.

40:06.129 --> 40:07.871
Not that often.

40:07.906 --> 40:11.399
- You know, I've been meaning
to tell you, I'm not here to...

40:11.434 --> 40:13.134
Oh, my God.

40:16.072 --> 40:18.539
-Oh, my God.

40:18.575 --> 40:20.095
Should I buy a tabby
or a Siamese cat?

40:22.136 --> 40:24.336
-Okay, cabrones.

40:24.372 --> 40:26.172
Our pick.
The eating contest.

40:26.207 --> 40:28.074
-Yeah, but not food...

40:28.109 --> 40:30.109
Habaneros, baby.

40:30.144 --> 40:31.677
Hot peppers, bro.

40:31.713 --> 40:34.280
You gotta eat as many
as you can in three minutes.

40:34.315 --> 40:35.392
And Habaneros...

40:35.416 --> 40:36.916
Habaneros are the Devil's food.

40:36.951 --> 40:38.217
-Yup.

40:38.252 --> 40:40.553
-They can't be that bad.

40:40.588 --> 40:42.266
- Oh, you're about to find out.

40:42.290 --> 40:43.689
-Can I eat for the family?

40:43.725 --> 40:46.392
- Yeah, Gravy, you can eat
for the family for sure.

40:46.427 --> 40:48.527
- 'Cause Habaneros are organic,

40:48.563 --> 40:52.665
and I do non-pharmaceuticals
really well.

40:52.700 --> 40:53.944
Yeah. Like, one time I got
lost in the desert.

40:53.968 --> 40:55.534
Yeah.

40:55.570 --> 40:58.104
I had to eat 67 mushrooms
to survive.

40:58.139 --> 40:59.139
-Caps and stems?

40:59.173 --> 41:00.306
-The whole thing.

41:00.341 --> 41:03.535
I hallucinated for 15 days.

41:03.570 --> 41:05.381
- My diarrhea tasted like honey.
- Ugh!

41:05.405 --> 41:07.472
That's beautiful, Gravy.

41:07.507 --> 41:09.607
- That's your son-in-law?
- Yep. Uh...

41:09.643 --> 41:11.187
- Your brother-in-law?
- Yes, my brother-in-law.

41:11.211 --> 41:12.944
-That's your brother.

41:12.979 --> 41:13.986
-In-law.

41:14.021 --> 41:16.948
- You said that like you might
have seen him naked or something.

41:18.418 --> 41:19.350
- All right, fool, I got this.

41:19.386 --> 41:20.826
- No, clown, I love Habaneros.

41:20.862 --> 41:22.906
- What are you talking about?
Who you calling a clown, man?

41:22.930 --> 41:24.901
I can eat so many more Habaneros
than you, I always have.

41:24.925 --> 41:27.125
-No.

41:29.062 --> 41:30.062
-You, papi?

41:30.097 --> 41:32.097
-What, he's...

41:32.132 --> 41:33.465
resurrected.

41:33.500 --> 41:35.060
- It's like it's Easter
or something.

41:36.603 --> 41:39.304
- I've been eating
Habaneros for 65 years.

41:39.339 --> 41:41.639
I will win for the familia.

41:41.675 --> 41:44.367
Mira. This is what I
have been whittling. Huh?

41:44.402 --> 41:47.036
Ocho!

41:47.072 --> 41:49.472
For cervezas.

41:49.507 --> 41:54.077
Ocho is now
an official St. Bernardo.

41:54.112 --> 41:55.278
Whoo!

41:55.313 --> 41:56.424
- Papi made a joke.
- Yeah.

41:56.448 --> 41:59.415
- Habaneros are
nothing to Mexicans.

41:59.451 --> 42:02.051
We put hot sauce
on our hot sauce.

42:04.556 --> 42:06.289
- He made another joke.
- That's awesome.

42:06.324 --> 42:08.558
- I'm ready.
Let's do this.

42:08.593 --> 42:11.160
- All right, pendejos,
the timer is set.

42:11.196 --> 42:14.330
Three, two, one, go!

42:41.718 --> 42:45.219
- There's something going
on in my fucking mouth.

42:47.623 --> 42:51.418
- Do men... Do you think
men ever get like

42:51.453 --> 42:55.155
a POV of themselves
and just go...

42:55.190 --> 42:56.190
"We're really stupid"?

43:06.001 --> 43:07.734
- Oh!
- Oh!

43:19.648 --> 43:22.215
- May the Devil use
your backbone as a trellis,

43:22.250 --> 43:24.584
to pick apples in Hell.

43:24.619 --> 43:28.722
To you, Mr. DiMaggio,
and to you, Dr. Freud.

43:28.724 --> 43:30.268
If you don't
know where you're going,

43:30.292 --> 43:31.332
there are plenty of roads.

43:37.599 --> 43:40.366
- Okay. So, she's
not just crazy beautiful,

43:40.402 --> 43:42.202
she's actually smart enough to

43:42.237 --> 43:44.604
see right through me.

43:44.639 --> 43:46.225
- You need to look past
the train-wreck he is

43:46.249 --> 43:49.434
and see the man that was crying when he
thought the doggies wouldn't make it.

43:49.469 --> 43:50.909
- Okay, that's a...
That's a turnoff.

43:51.638 --> 43:54.439
May I just say I'm not
usually the crying type.

43:54.474 --> 43:55.339
- I thought it was sweet,
you know,

43:55.375 --> 43:57.784
you crying like a little sissy.

43:57.819 --> 44:02.280
- I cried, because when I was
giving them mouth to snout,

44:02.315 --> 44:03.823
Ocho slipped me some tongue.

44:03.859 --> 44:09.387
I-I-I-I-I can still taste the,
ugh, the lamb and carrots.

44:09.422 --> 44:11.765
Okay, okay. Let's...
Let's recap.

44:11.800 --> 44:15.626
I know I come off like a...
Like a bit of a tough guy,

44:15.662 --> 44:18.763
but I do cry when I see
that doggies are hurt,

44:20.266 --> 44:21.199
and you're half naked...

44:21.234 --> 44:23.000
I'm sorry about that.

44:23.036 --> 44:24.036
-Are you?

44:26.039 --> 44:27.039
-Oh, shit.

44:28.475 --> 44:30.166
Don't move.
That's a coral snake.

44:30.201 --> 44:32.468
You'll be totally safe

44:32.503 --> 44:34.470
if you stand there,
just like that,

44:34.505 --> 44:36.025
back lit by the sun,
looking perfect.

44:39.177 --> 44:41.143
Damn it! You moved!

44:41.179 --> 44:42.611
Now you look awful.

44:42.647 --> 44:44.407
You went from looking
like a goddess, to a...

44:45.283 --> 44:46.749
To a favela in a bikini.

44:48.219 --> 44:49.219
-What are we gonna do?

44:51.189 --> 44:54.657
-If we meld as one,

44:54.692 --> 44:56.612
it'll see us as a much
larger and greater threat,

44:57.428 --> 44:59.762
and then slither
away sheepishly.

45:01.299 --> 45:03.766
So, this is us... melding.

45:05.069 --> 45:06.035
Here we go.

45:06.070 --> 45:07.103
-Whoa, whoa.

45:07.138 --> 45:09.739
In chapter seven

45:09.741 --> 45:11.685
in one of the most brilliant
novels I've ever read,

45:11.709 --> 45:13.629
the main character finds
a coral snake in a barn.

45:14.704 --> 45:16.281
Roger tells her, "Red over
yellow kills a fellow.

45:16.305 --> 45:18.639
Red over black, venom lack."

45:18.674 --> 45:19.918
So our little friend
over there isn't poisonous.

45:19.942 --> 45:21.108
-Wow.

45:21.143 --> 45:21.942
You read my novel?

45:21.977 --> 45:23.477
-Twice.

45:23.512 --> 45:25.112
- So I guess you know what a...

45:25.147 --> 45:27.247
What a clich I am.

45:27.283 --> 45:28.415
-Oh, a writer who drinks.

45:28.451 --> 45:30.484
- You forgot to
mention "tortured."

45:30.519 --> 45:33.220
- And I left out
"scared and insecure."

45:33.255 --> 45:35.089
-Aha! Well, perhaps that

45:35.124 --> 45:37.291
is why I drink.

45:37.326 --> 45:39.135
-But we never see you drink,

45:39.170 --> 45:41.373
because we're always distracted by the
things you're pointing to, you know?

45:41.397 --> 45:44.431
Justin Bieber, dumpster fires,

45:44.467 --> 45:45.644
twenty-four hour
Popeye's Chicken...

45:45.668 --> 45:50.104
- The really tall midget
enlightened trucker...

45:50.139 --> 45:51.338
Silent bagpipes,

45:51.373 --> 45:54.300
Pete Best, Blockbuster Video.

45:54.335 --> 45:55.201
-The cast of "Breakfast Club,"

45:55.236 --> 45:57.470
and one of my favorites,

45:57.505 --> 45:58.945
"That cloud looks
like a drag queen."

46:00.442 --> 46:01.652
Let me see
if I got this straight.

46:01.676 --> 46:04.410
You wrote one novel,
got lots of critical praise,

46:04.446 --> 46:05.806
then you finished?
What happened?

46:09.117 --> 46:11.417
-Wait a second.

46:11.453 --> 46:13.753
Is that Charlie Jones
over there?

46:15.356 --> 46:17.156
Behind that empty typewriter?

46:17.192 --> 46:19.959
Frozen, hammered...

46:19.994 --> 46:22.061
Alone...

46:22.097 --> 46:23.730
-No, it isn't.

46:23.732 --> 46:26.232
I guess if my head was
filled with that kind of crap,

46:26.267 --> 46:27.033
I'd probably drink, too.

46:27.068 --> 46:29.368
But I don't.

46:29.404 --> 46:30.644
So good luck with your travels.

46:32.440 --> 46:35.232
- Wait.
What if I...

46:35.268 --> 46:36.734
What if... I didn't drink?

46:39.272 --> 46:40.272
I guess we'll never know.

46:41.574 --> 46:43.174
But I do know you are
a brilliant writer.

46:59.459 --> 47:01.759
- I swear, that was
not me peeing.

47:16.676 --> 47:18.111
- Last one to drop their
hand off the car wins.

47:18.135 --> 47:19.968
- Ocho.

47:23.974 --> 47:24.974
Gracias.

47:27.678 --> 47:29.745
- Uncle Gravy saw some
bad boys right over there.

47:31.015 --> 47:32.414
Oh, yeah.

47:32.450 --> 47:35.184
Yeah, you gotta be real careful.

47:35.219 --> 47:36.219
They got 10,000 eyes.

47:38.255 --> 47:40.189
Kind of like my ex-wife.

47:40.224 --> 47:41.182
-Are you gonna do it?

47:41.217 --> 47:42.758
-It's been a long time.

47:44.061 --> 47:45.253
I'm scared.

47:45.288 --> 47:46.408
-Do it. You won't. No balls.

47:47.031 --> 47:48.764
-No balls?

47:55.239 --> 47:57.272
-I got him! I got him!

47:57.308 --> 47:58.308
I gotcha! You're gonna...

47:58.935 --> 48:01.436
-Ahem!

48:01.471 --> 48:02.911
- Oh, yeah.
I need one of your hairs.

48:04.441 --> 48:06.974
You're ready for
your little leash?

48:10.413 --> 48:12.113
- Que Paso, little flower?
Yes?

48:12.148 --> 48:14.115
-Dad, what's sex?

48:17.387 --> 48:18.564
- Have fun with that one, Dad.

48:18.588 --> 48:20.421
Listen up. He's got a lot
of good advice.

48:20.457 --> 48:23.424
- Yeah, Felipa.
Thank you very much.

48:23.460 --> 48:25.093
- What's sex? Huh?
Tell her, Dad.

48:25.128 --> 48:26.128
-Let's hear it.

48:27.263 --> 48:29.030
- Excuse me.
Thank you.

48:29.065 --> 48:31.365
Um... Uh...

48:31.401 --> 48:33.267
Sex is like, like...
It's...

48:33.303 --> 48:35.670
It's when you hug someone.

48:35.705 --> 48:37.616
- Come on, brother, that's it?
- Hug real tight.

48:37.640 --> 48:40.232
- So, wait. So I've had
sex with my grandpa.

48:40.268 --> 48:41.967
-I wouldn't be surprised.

48:43.938 --> 48:46.439
-Okay.

48:46.474 --> 48:47.914
Well, I...
I guess you're old enough.

48:50.378 --> 48:53.746
Sex is when Mommy and Daddy...

48:54.982 --> 48:56.615
uh, hug.

48:56.651 --> 49:00.619
And we don't
have any clothes on.

49:00.655 --> 49:02.688
- Well, you better get
naked and start hugging,

49:02.724 --> 49:06.058
'cause they said dinner
will be ready in two secs.

49:10.031 --> 49:12.398
-Yes! Yes!

49:12.433 --> 49:15.601
Dinner will be ready
in two secs!

49:15.636 --> 49:17.536
He's my son and
I love him, but...

49:17.572 --> 49:19.847
You know,
you hate to see 'em struggle.

49:19.883 --> 49:23.743
This thing that he's struggling
with, has this, uh...

49:23.778 --> 49:26.170
Has this got anything to do
with why he's not married

49:26.205 --> 49:28.906
and not settled down?

49:28.941 --> 49:30.441
-Yeah.

49:30.476 --> 49:32.676
Well, hopefully
he'll figure it out.

49:32.712 --> 49:34.745
We got a guy coming up
that's gonna help with that.

49:35.915 --> 49:37.748
-Oh!

49:39.018 --> 49:41.118
I get it.

49:41.153 --> 49:43.087
- You do?
- Yeah.

49:43.122 --> 49:44.288
Hey, it's fine.

49:44.323 --> 49:47.124
I mean, every family has got

49:47.159 --> 49:48.159
someone who is...

49:49.095 --> 49:50.494
different.

49:50.529 --> 49:52.563
I mean, and you're
fine with it, right?

49:52.598 --> 49:54.238
You've probably seen
a whole lot of stuff.

49:54.266 --> 49:55.266
-I used to be a fireman.

49:57.369 --> 49:58.302
Drinking got the best of me.

49:58.337 --> 49:59.457
I couldn't control it, so...

50:01.173 --> 50:02.173
they fired me.

50:03.234 --> 50:04.200
Tried the Bible.

50:04.235 --> 50:06.169
Jim Beam vs. John 3:10.

50:06.204 --> 50:08.037
That didn't work out.

50:08.073 --> 50:08.905
-Jim Beam won?

50:08.940 --> 50:11.441
-Yeah.

50:11.476 --> 50:12.836
I went to AA.
Let go and let God...

50:16.548 --> 50:19.615
I'm keeping my side
of the street clean.

50:19.651 --> 50:21.751
- You know, as a parent
I made mistakes, too.

50:23.588 --> 50:24.554
I mean, I know it
really bothers Ron Ron,

50:24.589 --> 50:28.057
the way I focus in
on Franklin's potential.

50:28.093 --> 50:28.958
But Ron Ron...

50:28.993 --> 50:30.493
He's...

50:30.528 --> 50:32.168
He's special.

50:37.035 --> 50:38.876
-Special.

50:38.911 --> 50:42.813
You know, a couple of old
school guys like you and me...

50:45.668 --> 50:46.979
gotta learn it's
a new world out there, man.

50:47.003 --> 50:48.003
New rules.

50:49.338 --> 50:50.905
Charlie's gonna be all right.

50:50.940 --> 50:52.173
-Yeah.

50:52.208 --> 50:52.749
-And I mean, things...

50:52.784 --> 50:55.785
Things are a lot easier
nowadays for guys like him.

50:58.181 --> 51:00.081
I'll be right back.

51:01.350 --> 51:03.417
-It's like a little fly kite.

51:03.453 --> 51:04.933
He looks like a real goer.

51:06.289 --> 51:07.329
Watch what I do next here.

51:09.092 --> 51:11.158
Okay, big guy.

51:11.194 --> 51:12.194
Time to go to work.

51:15.840 --> 51:19.033
- Going somewhere with all
those bells and smells on?

51:20.336 --> 51:22.336
-Uh, I was just about to...

51:22.371 --> 51:24.138
- I know where you're going.

51:24.173 --> 51:25.506
- You do?
- Yep.

51:25.541 --> 51:28.100
And I think you two
make a great pair.

51:28.135 --> 51:30.402
- You do?
- Yes!

51:30.438 --> 51:31.718
I even like
the ring of her name.

51:32.206 --> 51:33.206
- Shantaysia.
- Fe...

51:34.241 --> 51:36.241
Shan... Shantaysia? Oh.

51:36.277 --> 51:38.544
- Yeah, yeah.
- Shantaysia.

51:38.579 --> 51:40.290
- Now, look, I know
what you're gonna say.

51:40.314 --> 51:41.434
I know I push a little hard.

51:42.550 --> 51:44.483
But it's because you got
so much promise,

51:44.518 --> 51:45.958
and I just want you
to deliver on it.

51:47.221 --> 51:48.387
See, back in the day,

51:48.422 --> 51:50.189
when I was coming up your age...

51:50.224 --> 51:52.233
Phew! And the time...

51:52.268 --> 51:55.428
I never would have dreamed I'd have a son
that's on the verge of running a city.

51:56.430 --> 51:59.364
I just want to
say to you, son...

51:59.400 --> 52:00.032
I'm proud of you.
- Oh, Pop.

52:00.067 --> 52:02.201
-Real proud.

52:02.236 --> 52:03.236
-Oh, Pop. Thanks, man.

52:04.972 --> 52:07.473
Whoo.

52:07.508 --> 52:09.032
- Now you go ahead on
for your walk.

52:10.269 --> 52:11.944
-And don't make her late.

52:11.979 --> 52:15.105
No son of mine is gonna take
longer than a woman to get ready.

52:15.140 --> 52:16.740
-Oh, come on, man.

52:18.711 --> 52:20.021
You sound like an episode
of "Sanford and Son."

52:20.045 --> 52:23.346
- Oh!

52:23.382 --> 52:25.749
Ah! Romance is
in the hizzouse.

52:27.019 --> 52:29.519
-Hey, hey.

52:29.555 --> 52:31.032
- Hey, Shay-Shay.
- Hey. Have a nice walk.

52:31.056 --> 52:33.623
-All right.

52:33.659 --> 52:35.459
- Uh... Then where is he
going all dressed up?

52:37.129 --> 52:38.462
Who isn't here?

52:38.497 --> 52:40.097
Hey, Charlie, where are you?

52:41.033 --> 52:42.033
-Charlie?

52:46.238 --> 52:47.771
Charlie and Franklin?

52:51.002 --> 52:52.002
Oh, Lord.

52:58.476 --> 53:00.976
- Oh, hey. You're here.
How you doing?

53:01.012 --> 53:02.211
-I'm good.

53:02.246 --> 53:03.012
-Funny seeing you here.

53:03.047 --> 53:05.014
-Not really.

53:05.049 --> 53:06.515
-Uh, just...

53:06.551 --> 53:08.651
Well, being that I'm here,
you're here,

53:08.686 --> 53:10.406
I thought we could talk
about this whole...

53:11.155 --> 53:13.089
Fake Mom thing.

53:13.124 --> 53:14.090
-What about it?

53:14.125 --> 53:16.625
-Maybe, well...

53:16.661 --> 53:18.501
Not that I thought
about it a lot, but I did...

53:19.664 --> 53:22.198
jot down some alts,
as you kids like to say.

53:22.233 --> 53:23.466
-I've never said that.

53:23.501 --> 53:24.233
- You don't say "alts" for...
Okay.

53:24.268 --> 53:26.235
-You wrote all of that?

53:26.270 --> 53:27.503
-Yeah, just a few, um...

53:27.538 --> 53:31.273
Just a few alternatives
to "Fake Mom."

53:31.309 --> 53:32.332
Not that I don't love it.

53:32.368 --> 53:33.776
But I just thought, why not...

53:33.811 --> 53:38.305
Trophy Mom? I could be
like a Trophy Mom, you know?

53:38.340 --> 53:39.173
I always wanted...
- No. No.

53:39.208 --> 53:40.174
-No? Okay, not great.

53:40.209 --> 53:41.742
Okay. How about, um...

53:43.012 --> 53:43.977
Mom Again?

53:44.013 --> 53:45.179
Mom Again.

53:45.214 --> 53:46.714
You know what I mean?

53:46.716 --> 53:48.560
Like, when you call me,
you'll be like, "Mom Again!"

53:48.584 --> 53:52.152
- No. Fake Mom.
- Okay. How about "This Mom"?

53:52.188 --> 53:54.146
This Mom. This Mom.

53:54.181 --> 53:55.622
You know what I mean?

53:55.658 --> 53:58.417
- Who would say any of this?
- Probably nobody.

53:58.452 --> 53:59.359
How about "Other Mom"?
"Cute Mom"?

53:59.395 --> 54:02.354
- Cute? Cute Mom?
- "Mom Mom"?

54:02.389 --> 54:03.442
Okay, "Mom Mom."
Mom Mom is cute.

54:03.466 --> 54:05.265
Right? You'll be like,
"Mom Mom!"

54:05.301 --> 54:06.633
-What am I, two years old?

54:06.669 --> 54:08.413
- 'Cause it wouldn't be like
your first mom...

54:08.437 --> 54:10.204
- I have my real mom...
- Uh-huh.

54:10.239 --> 54:10.880
-And then I have you.

54:10.915 --> 54:14.466
- Right and I would never wanna...
- And you are my fake mom.

54:14.501 --> 54:17.536
And you need to
stop trying to act...

54:17.571 --> 54:18.170
- Take the place of her.
- Yeah, exactly.

54:18.205 --> 54:19.205
-Yeah, I would never.

54:19.239 --> 54:20.305
-Well, you're trying to.

54:20.340 --> 54:21.740
- No, I don't.
I wouldn't...

54:23.577 --> 54:26.111
I think this has been
a productive talk.

54:26.146 --> 54:27.579
All right, well...

54:27.614 --> 54:29.581
Um, do you want me to
button up your shirt?

54:29.616 --> 54:31.249
No. Okay. It's supposed
to be like that.

54:31.285 --> 54:31.983
- Yeah.
- Okay. All right.

54:32.019 --> 54:33.019
All right.

54:40.327 --> 54:42.427
-My family may not win this.

54:42.463 --> 54:43.762
Which means
my plans get flushed.

54:46.366 --> 54:47.410
-You've got to tell your dad.

54:47.434 --> 54:48.767
We both do.
I can't keep lying.

54:52.406 --> 54:54.606
- I don't know.
My dad is crazy.

54:54.641 --> 54:57.168
It's like he wants me to be
Mayor someday,

54:57.203 --> 54:58.944
so it's...
You know?

54:58.979 --> 55:02.673
- Yeah. And you can't do that with
a Mexican woman by your side.

55:02.709 --> 55:05.109
- What? I didn't say that.
I mean, why did you...

55:05.144 --> 55:07.545
-Look, Franklin...

55:07.580 --> 55:09.346
I'm glad that you
worry about your father.

55:09.382 --> 55:11.282
I worry about my father, too.

55:11.317 --> 55:13.517
They want so much for us,

55:13.553 --> 55:15.073
even though sometimes
it's misguided.

55:16.656 --> 55:19.290
But I think that we've been
fooling ourselves

55:19.325 --> 55:21.292
hoping that this will work.

55:21.327 --> 55:23.494
-What are you talking about?

55:23.529 --> 55:24.161
- We were going to
lean on each other,

55:24.197 --> 55:27.531
but maybe we can't.

55:27.567 --> 55:28.818
And it's better that
we learned it now,

55:28.842 --> 55:32.336
before we commit to something
that isn't gonna work.

55:32.371 --> 55:33.531
-Felipa, what are you saying?

55:35.441 --> 55:36.681
Making it easier on both of us.

55:37.935 --> 55:38.935
What?

55:41.305 --> 55:42.938
Felipa, what are you doing?

55:42.973 --> 55:43.973
Felipa.

55:47.945 --> 55:48.945
Fuck!

55:58.556 --> 56:00.008
- Ron Ron, I told you
to knock that off.

56:00.032 --> 56:03.492
You're gonna mess around and put
a hole in the back of your neck.

56:03.527 --> 56:05.038
- So you're just
telling me stuff, huh?

56:05.062 --> 56:06.128
You told me?

56:06.163 --> 56:07.062
-Yeah, I told you.

56:07.098 --> 56:07.930
-You told me?

56:07.965 --> 56:08.965
-Yes.

56:09.967 --> 56:10.967
-Okay.

56:12.403 --> 56:13.268
Oh, that's it, Ron Ron.

56:13.304 --> 56:14.812
Wear those pants, brother.

56:14.847 --> 56:17.047
That way it'll tell your wife
who's the boss, brother.

56:19.535 --> 56:21.168
- You know something?
Watch this. Ahem!

56:21.203 --> 56:22.878
Keko, check this out.

56:22.913 --> 56:27.374
I'm in this contest where I
keep my hand on this damn car,

56:27.409 --> 56:28.241
so I can win it for the family.

56:28.277 --> 56:30.610
I'm a little thirsty now.

56:30.646 --> 56:32.057
I want you to go get me
one of those beers,

56:32.081 --> 56:33.313
open the top,

56:33.348 --> 56:35.215
and put the beer on my lips

56:35.250 --> 56:35.882
and pour it in my mouth.

56:35.918 --> 56:38.085
Now!

56:38.120 --> 56:39.653
Bullshit!

56:39.688 --> 56:42.689
Do I look like somebody
who's gonna pop a beer,

56:42.725 --> 56:44.758
put it on your lips and
pour it down your throat?

56:47.162 --> 56:48.328
-Never mind, baby.

56:48.363 --> 56:50.063
-Wow! What a beautiful thing.

56:50.099 --> 56:51.331
I mean, look.

56:51.366 --> 56:55.368
Every creed, race, and creed

56:55.404 --> 56:57.771
just hanging loose.
It's...

57:00.242 --> 57:01.242
I wanna give a speech.

57:06.940 --> 57:09.674
-Uh...

57:09.710 --> 57:12.544
So, you gonna make that
speech, hopper, or what?

57:12.579 --> 57:14.259
- Well, I gotta write
something down first.

57:16.349 --> 57:17.182
- That man is out of his mind.

57:17.217 --> 57:18.983
-He's a lunatic, man.

57:20.153 --> 57:22.153
-What's up, guys?

57:22.189 --> 57:24.389
-What's up, Charlie?

57:24.424 --> 57:25.704
- You smell what
I'm stepping in?

57:26.526 --> 57:27.425
You smell of something, brother.

57:27.461 --> 57:29.527
- Yeah, the kids
used to say that.

57:29.563 --> 57:31.441
- What kids used to say that?
I don't...

57:31.465 --> 57:33.298
- I heard a couple
of kids say it.

57:33.333 --> 57:35.108
Oh, hey Charlie, man.

57:35.144 --> 57:37.984
I see your hybrid's got all the latest
gadgets, man, that's pretty cool.

57:39.473 --> 57:39.938
It's like...
It's like "Star Trek."

57:39.973 --> 57:40.814
-What?

57:40.849 --> 57:43.167
- Yeah, yeah. You got one of
those special force fields.

57:43.202 --> 57:45.069
What do they call it?

57:45.104 --> 57:46.104
Pussy Deflector.

57:47.273 --> 57:49.406
-Charlie, where were you?

57:49.442 --> 57:50.652
- I was in the lake, washing up.

57:50.676 --> 57:52.743
- Oh, yeah? Did you wash
behind your ears, fool?

57:54.480 --> 57:55.800
♪ Did you wash
behind your ears? ♪

58:00.319 --> 58:02.553
-♪ Wash behind the ears ♪

58:02.588 --> 58:06.623
- ♪ Why don't you shut
The fuck up? ♪

58:06.659 --> 58:07.524
You know, Jose,
maybe you should try washing.

58:07.560 --> 58:10.527
I mean, even your tent
has skid marks.

58:10.563 --> 58:12.971
And don't be stingy
with the Lever 2000.

58:13.006 --> 58:16.433
Maybe you should call them and
see if they got a Lever 10000.

58:16.469 --> 58:17.512
- What are you
talking about, man?

58:17.536 --> 58:19.269
That's pheromones.
The chicks dig that.

58:19.305 --> 58:20.345
Jose does smell.

58:22.208 --> 58:23.307
You got that right.

58:23.342 --> 58:24.900
Hey, pass me that bullhorn.

58:24.935 --> 58:25.935
What?

58:29.173 --> 58:31.173
Hey, y'all.

58:31.208 --> 58:34.476
Jose BO smell so bad,

58:34.511 --> 58:35.977
he need the Right
and the Left Guard.

58:38.023 --> 58:41.650
You get it? 'Cause it's the Right
Guard, that's what it's called.

58:41.685 --> 58:43.652
And he smells, so he
needs both sides of it,

58:43.687 --> 58:44.906
- 'cause it's the left...
- Yeah, they got it.

58:44.930 --> 58:47.965
They didn't like that one? Okay,
I got another one for you.

58:48.000 --> 58:52.803
What is the flattest surface
that you could iron anything on?

58:55.399 --> 58:58.100
A white girl's ass.

58:58.135 --> 59:00.001
-Hey! Bullshit!

59:00.037 --> 59:02.471
Bullshit!

59:02.506 --> 59:05.006
Check out this
masterpiece of assery.

59:05.042 --> 59:06.266
-Oh, yeah.

59:08.403 --> 59:09.647
- Mind if I do a little tucking?

59:09.671 --> 59:12.672
- I don't know.
- It looks pretty flat to me.

59:12.708 --> 59:14.452
Although, wait a minute.
Maybe this is a bad angle.

59:14.476 --> 59:14.850
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You check it out.

59:14.885 --> 59:17.285
- We got a challenger on the
plane, ladies and gentlemen.

59:19.081 --> 59:19.788
Yeah, my bad.

59:19.823 --> 59:22.248
I was wrong. You're right.
Okay, I'll concede the point.

59:22.284 --> 59:24.017
Oh, I got one, I got one.

59:24.052 --> 59:24.793
Right, uh...

59:24.828 --> 59:29.122
Okay, y'all. What's nine
inches long and white? Huh?

59:29.157 --> 59:32.125
Anybody? Anybody?

59:32.160 --> 59:33.993
Not a damn thing!

59:37.065 --> 59:38.231
-Oh, really?

59:38.266 --> 59:40.100
Really? I call bullshit.

59:40.135 --> 59:41.568
Oh, yeah?

59:41.603 --> 59:44.070
- Check out this masterpiece
of dickery.

59:47.568 --> 59:48.100
- All right, all right.
Fine, fine, fine.

59:48.135 --> 59:49.101
Give me that horn.

59:49.136 --> 59:50.977
Give me that horn.

59:51.012 --> 59:54.373
- And now Charlie has taken the
bullhorn, ladies and gentlemen.

59:54.408 --> 59:55.207
This competition is heating up.

59:55.242 --> 59:56.242
Let's see what he's got.

59:58.646 --> 01:00:00.424
- Did you hear about
the black and Mexican guy

01:00:00.448 --> 01:00:02.014
that opened
a restaurant together?

01:00:02.049 --> 01:00:03.515
No.

01:00:03.551 --> 01:00:05.759
It's called "Nacho Mama."

01:00:05.794 --> 01:00:08.120
- Oh, hey, what happens when
a white guy with a boner

01:00:08.155 --> 01:00:10.022
walks into a wall?

01:00:10.057 --> 01:00:11.156
What?

01:00:11.192 --> 01:00:12.192
-He breaks his nose.

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:19.009
Franklin, he takes the bullhorn.

01:00:19.033 --> 01:00:21.366
All right.

01:00:21.402 --> 01:00:24.203
Why do white people love hockey?

01:00:24.238 --> 01:00:26.338
- Why?
- Why is that?

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:26.846
-Because if they ain't a cop,

01:00:26.882 --> 01:00:28.977
that's the only chance they
get to beat something black.

01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:32.102
-Ooh, ooh.

01:00:32.137 --> 01:00:35.505
-Oh, in your face!

01:00:35.541 --> 01:00:38.208
- What do you call
a black man in a suit?

01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:40.010
- What?
- The defendant.

01:00:43.858 --> 01:00:47.718
- I got one, I got one, you
guys, wait for this. Ready?

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.364
- Oh, ladies and gentleman,
looks like the pole dancer

01:00:49.388 --> 01:00:51.621
wants to enter the competition.

01:00:51.657 --> 01:00:53.368
She's teeing it up,
let's see what she's got.

01:00:53.392 --> 01:00:55.959
- What do you call a black...

01:00:55.994 --> 01:00:58.462
wait...

01:00:58.497 --> 01:01:01.331
- Ooh, and Daisy Duke's
got nothing.

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:03.842
Fuck this shit.

01:01:03.878 --> 01:01:06.603
- All right. Well, there's
some good news and bad news.

01:01:06.638 --> 01:01:09.606
While she had
the bullhorn, ratings spiked,

01:01:09.641 --> 01:01:12.000
but the bad news
is everybody's IQ went down.

01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:20.675
- Okay, all right, all right.
I got one for you.

01:01:20.711 --> 01:01:23.178
Uh... hey! What do white
women make for dinner?

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:25.013
- What?
- Reservations.

01:01:29.486 --> 01:01:30.839
- Oh, no, and ladies
and gentlemen,

01:01:30.863 --> 01:01:34.489
the park rangers are getting
involved in the competition.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.591
And either
this brother is color blind

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.426
or he is flat-out
helping the wrong family.

01:01:38.462 --> 01:01:42.130
You sure about that?

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:43.698
-They'll love it.

01:01:43.734 --> 01:01:46.367
When a black
and a Mexican are in a car,

01:01:46.403 --> 01:01:48.002
- who's driving?
- Who?

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:50.004
-The cop.

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:57.603
- Yeah, okay, brother, don't...
check on out. okay, thank you.

01:01:57.639 --> 01:02:00.440
Yeah, you can go on
and clock out. Thank you.

01:02:00.475 --> 01:02:03.676
And now,
Franklin takes the bullhorn.

01:02:03.712 --> 01:02:06.079
Let's see if he can pull
one out for his team.

01:02:06.114 --> 01:02:07.447
All right, uh...

01:02:07.482 --> 01:02:09.082
why do white folks
have so many pets?

01:02:09.117 --> 01:02:10.483
Why?

01:02:10.518 --> 01:02:12.038
- 'Cause they can't
own people anymore.

01:02:14.589 --> 01:02:16.233
Boom! Drop the bull horn.
That's right.

01:02:18.159 --> 01:02:19.892
-Hey! Ya, ya, ya!

01:02:19.928 --> 01:02:22.095
-Ya!

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:25.298
-Hey, hey, hey!

01:02:25.333 --> 01:02:27.300
What's going on, everybody?

01:02:27.335 --> 01:02:28.434
My name is Johnny Jon-John.

01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:30.303
I'll be running
the intervention.

01:02:30.338 --> 01:02:31.637
And it is for Charlie Jones,

01:02:31.673 --> 01:02:33.150
is there a a Charlie Jones?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:02:33.174 --> 01:02:34.199
-No, no, not now.

01:02:34.234 --> 01:02:35.808
-An intervention for me?

01:02:35.844 --> 01:02:40.012
- No, no, no. You can go now.
We don't need you. We're fine.

01:02:40.048 --> 01:02:44.509
- I should have seen you a mile away.
Yes, sir, let's get right to it.

01:02:44.545 --> 01:02:46.145
Anyone want to speak
up about this joker?

01:02:48.082 --> 01:02:50.515
Okay. I'll go.

01:02:50.551 --> 01:02:53.452
All right, uh...
this is an intervention.

01:02:53.487 --> 01:02:55.194
10th one's free.
Another joke we do.

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:58.075
I like to lighten the mood a little bit
when someone is heading into the grave.

01:02:58.099 --> 01:03:02.594
Your family put together a list of
things you've done while... drunk.

01:03:02.629 --> 01:03:04.596
- They put together a list?
- Yeah, that's...

01:03:04.631 --> 01:03:07.566
that's how it works.
- Give us the short list.

01:03:07.601 --> 01:03:10.335
- Let's see, boo...
you burned down a farm,

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:14.539
with a barn and three cows?

01:03:14.575 --> 01:03:16.077
- They were goats.
- Oh, they were goats.

01:03:16.101 --> 01:03:18.435
Only goats, oh.

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:20.303
Well, that's cool.
He's a great guy.

01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:22.505
For he's a jolly...

01:03:22.541 --> 01:03:23.760
No, you're horrible.
I'm kidding again.

01:03:23.784 --> 01:03:26.576
Oh, it keeps going. You
got drunk at a carnival

01:03:26.611 --> 01:03:28.745
and you shot a fireman?
- He was off duty.

01:03:30.282 --> 01:03:32.582
And a bit shifty.
- Oh.

01:03:32.617 --> 01:03:35.452
Okay, off duty and shifty.
- He was shifty.

01:03:35.487 --> 01:03:37.095
- Sounds to me
like you're enabling.

01:03:37.131 --> 01:03:40.457
- Oh, that's a pretty big word for
something that I'm... not really doing.

01:03:40.492 --> 01:03:42.559
- You unbolted
the Ferris wheel too?

01:03:42.594 --> 01:03:46.596
- Yeah, it's a wheel,
so it could roam away.

01:03:46.631 --> 01:03:48.465
- To give it a head start
for the next town.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.233
- Hello?
- Shaved a librarian's head?

01:03:50.268 --> 01:03:51.910
-She may have had lice.

01:03:51.945 --> 01:03:55.305
- All right, and you pushed your
cousin Bobby down some stairs.

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:57.407
He had lice, right.

01:03:57.442 --> 01:03:59.333
He's got the RID and the comb.

01:03:59.369 --> 01:03:59.876
All right, you did him a favor.

01:03:59.911 --> 01:04:05.640
Uh, did you shoot 72 bottle
rockets at your old high school?

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.286
- Let's just say
that I enhanced its curb appeal.

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:09.143
And most of them were duds.

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:11.412
- Over 50%?
- Duh.

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:13.214
- Holy shit,
what am I doing here?

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:15.483
What a waste of my time.

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:15.917
This guy seems fine
to me. You single?

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:20.421
-Uh...

01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:23.324
I am, but now
that you mention it,

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:26.427
I was... but a few hours ago,

01:04:26.463 --> 01:04:28.763
I'm... now I'm not...
Not... no.

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:31.808
- Final answer?
- Final answer.

01:04:31.843 --> 01:04:35.069
- I wasn't even talking to you.
I was talking to her.

01:04:35.105 --> 01:04:37.538
-Me? Holy God.

01:04:37.574 --> 01:04:39.399
- Sounds like a no, um...
- You know what?

01:04:39.435 --> 01:04:41.368
This, this, this, whole event...

01:04:41.403 --> 01:04:44.538
can, can, can "mange" my taint.

01:04:44.573 --> 01:04:46.473
I don't need this,
this, this intervention.

01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:48.475
- Well, I fucking
don't need it either.

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.477
All right, I'm outy
like five thouty.

01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:52.412
Anybody need weed,
holler at your boy.

01:04:52.448 --> 01:04:55.549
It's nice out here!
I'm joking.

01:04:55.584 --> 01:04:57.918
This place is fun
if I was the Zika virus.

01:04:57.953 --> 01:04:58.953
Uber!

01:05:00.456 --> 01:05:02.322
- What the hell
was that all about?

01:05:02.357 --> 01:05:03.924
-Look, son, we didn't mean to.

01:05:03.959 --> 01:05:06.259
-Shit.

01:05:06.295 --> 01:05:08.695
Took my hand off the car.

01:05:08.731 --> 01:05:12.599
- Oh, yeah, so now it's
just me and Mr. Jonas.

01:05:12.634 --> 01:05:14.434
Oh, no,
Papi's going to swat the fly.

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:16.036
Papi, Papi, Papi, wait!

01:05:18.507 --> 01:05:21.266
- Dad.
- You let go of the door, Pops.

01:05:21.301 --> 01:05:23.134
-I won! I won! I won, I won!

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:25.070
We won! Oh, my Gosh!

01:05:25.105 --> 01:05:27.080
-Well, we won...

01:05:27.116 --> 01:05:29.861
But it was kind of fun the way it
turned out. Why doesn't everybody stay?

01:05:29.885 --> 01:05:33.211
- I agree! Let's just everybody
stay and enjoy the weekend.

01:05:33.246 --> 01:05:34.888
-All right, we'll stay.

01:05:34.923 --> 01:05:38.283
But you gotta be able to keep
a leash on your son Charlie.

01:05:38.318 --> 01:05:40.418
- What!
- Wait, wait, wait...

01:05:40.454 --> 01:05:41.828
What the hell
did that just mean?

01:05:41.864 --> 01:05:47.525
- Madonna, some pendejo tried
to pin a mosq on my shirt...

01:05:47.561 --> 01:05:51.696
with a blonde hair,
the whites cheated.

01:05:51.732 --> 01:05:53.652
- Hey, I mean, come on, now...
the whites cheated

01:05:54.601 --> 01:05:56.079
and now Charlie
is after my son Franklin.

01:05:56.103 --> 01:05:58.436
- What?
- What?

01:05:58.472 --> 01:06:00.238
- Pop, what are you
talking about?

01:06:00.273 --> 01:06:01.740
-Come on, now, Franklin.

01:06:01.742 --> 01:06:02.819
I mean, you should have
told me that you were gay.

01:06:02.843 --> 01:06:07.403
I mean, is that why you...
don't want to run for Mayor?

01:06:07.439 --> 01:06:08.791
- Are you kidding...
I'm not gay.

01:06:08.815 --> 01:06:11.307
And if I was gay, I could get
way better than Charlie.

01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:13.309
-You think I'm after Franklin?

01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:15.578
- And a drunk!
- Okay, okay...

01:06:15.613 --> 01:06:17.613
you might have me
on the drunk thing but...

01:06:17.649 --> 01:06:19.360
you're out of your mind.
Everybody knows that

01:06:19.384 --> 01:06:21.050
Franklin's in love with Felipa.

01:06:21.086 --> 01:06:22.051
- What?
- What?

01:06:22.087 --> 01:06:24.028
-Oh, Charlie.

01:06:24.064 --> 01:06:28.491
- Even me, the huge drunk could
tell 14 seconds after I got here.

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:31.060
And you still don't see it?
- Felipa?

01:06:31.096 --> 01:06:34.464
Es la verdad?

01:06:34.499 --> 01:06:35.998
- Papi, I've been
meaning to tell you.

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:38.668
Yes, okay?

01:06:38.703 --> 01:06:40.081
Franklin and I have been
dating for over a year.

01:06:40.105 --> 01:06:41.780
- What?
- What?

01:06:41.815 --> 01:06:43.973
- You need to keep your son
away from my daughter.

01:06:44.008 --> 01:06:48.236
- Aye, no, no. You ain't calling
no shots in my family, El Chapo.

01:06:48.272 --> 01:06:49.705
-Oh, well, Pop, calm down.

01:06:49.707 --> 01:06:51.759
- No, no, no, no, and you, I
can't believe this, son.

01:06:51.783 --> 01:06:55.077
You've been sneaking around
with her behind my back,

01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:57.579
and lying and...

01:06:57.614 --> 01:07:00.415
standing up Shantaysia
who is hot to trot.

01:07:00.451 --> 01:07:03.018
- Wow, hot to trot
isn't accurate.

01:07:03.053 --> 01:07:04.319
-Okay, fine.

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:06.221
I came up here because we all

01:07:06.256 --> 01:07:08.356
needed to get together.

01:07:08.392 --> 01:07:11.293
I love Felipa.
That is my girl.

01:07:11.328 --> 01:07:12.661
That is why we are all here.

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:14.474
I don't know where the
white family came from,

01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:16.531
but that's why
our families are here.

01:07:16.567 --> 01:07:18.233
We planned it.
But you know what I hate?

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:20.569
Camping is what I hate.

01:07:20.604 --> 01:07:21.889
- I knew it, I knew it,
I fucking knew it.

01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:25.307
You are not perfect, brother.
You don't want to be a camper.

- This camping
can jump up my ass.

01:07:35.853 --> 01:07:38.278
These "Jurassic Park"
mosquitoes can jump up my ass.

01:07:38.313 --> 01:07:40.547
Sleeping in my car at night,

01:07:40.582 --> 01:07:41.181
waiting for somebody
to come and kill me...

01:07:41.216 --> 01:07:43.149
-Can jump up your ass.

01:07:43.185 --> 01:07:44.317
- Exactly.
- Right.

01:07:44.352 --> 01:07:46.261
-All this can jump up my ass.

01:07:46.296 --> 01:07:49.267
- Well, if you're going to act that way,
then why did we say we'd like to stay?

01:07:49.291 --> 01:07:50.256
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:07:50.292 --> 01:07:52.158
Let us stay?

01:07:52.194 --> 01:07:53.802
-The whites cheated.

01:07:53.837 --> 01:07:57.530
And we're going to win this
contest and kick you out.

01:07:57.566 --> 01:07:59.399
- Yeah, man, the hell
with all you guys.

01:07:59.434 --> 01:08:02.469
Final contest.
Winner or go home.

01:08:02.504 --> 01:08:04.495
- Let's get it on.
- Let's get it on.

01:08:04.531 --> 01:08:06.239
Let's vamos.

01:08:06.274 --> 01:08:07.373
- Let's do this.
- Huh.

01:08:07.409 --> 01:08:09.100
- Go this way.
- It's game over,

01:08:09.135 --> 01:08:10.135
tacos and Schlitz.

01:08:14.883 --> 01:08:19.343
- Hey, hey, gather around here,
I'm Peter Galkie, and I'm...

01:08:19.379 --> 01:08:20.678
one of the original spectators,

01:08:20.714 --> 01:08:22.390
so I think I'm probably
most qualified to describe

01:08:22.415 --> 01:08:25.249
what we're about
to witness here.

01:08:25.285 --> 01:08:27.652
This obstacle course race

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:30.388
is two miles total,
give or take a mile or two.

01:08:30.423 --> 01:08:32.457
And, uh, it's through the woods,

01:08:32.492 --> 01:08:34.725
and then you gotta
get past that lake

01:08:34.728 --> 01:08:37.562
and then make it up to
that clearing way up there

01:08:37.596 --> 01:08:39.630
'cause that's where
the finish line's at.

01:08:39.666 --> 01:08:41.277
So, what do you say
we all just sit back here,

01:08:41.301 --> 01:08:44.469
and let's enjoy the show.

01:08:44.504 --> 01:08:45.069
- Y'all ready for this?
Let's do this!

01:08:45.104 --> 01:08:46.203
Let's do this.

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:49.107
- Okay, everybody,
here are the rules.

01:08:49.142 --> 01:08:51.233
- Rules?
- Yeah.

01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:52.269
No rules!
Ready set, go!

01:08:54.572 --> 01:08:56.015
- Hey!
- You got dirt on my shoes.

01:09:11.122 --> 01:09:11.796
-I want to stay.

01:09:11.831 --> 01:09:14.423
- Yeah, why do parents always
have to ruin everything?

01:09:14.459 --> 01:09:17.193
I don't want to go.
- Me either.

01:09:17.228 --> 01:09:19.361
-Wait, I have an idea.

01:09:19.397 --> 01:09:20.474
Rolie, you still have that map?

01:09:20.497 --> 01:09:23.265
- Does the bear shit
in the woods?

01:09:23.301 --> 01:09:24.899
-Yes, young man, it does.

01:09:24.935 --> 01:09:27.502
-Ew!

01:09:27.537 --> 01:09:29.091
- He's gross.
- He smokes too much weed.

01:09:29.115 --> 01:09:33.435
One time he got so baked, he tried
to take his pants off over his head.

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:35.403
- What?
- It's an old Woody Allen joke.

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:37.439
- Okay, so you
see this ridge here.

01:09:37.474 --> 01:09:39.573
It horseshoes
around this mountain.

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:41.917
And if we cut across here,
then we're there.

01:09:41.953 --> 01:09:44.323
- The plan only works if we can
get to the finish line first.

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:46.448
-Think we can get there first?

01:09:46.483 --> 01:09:47.415
- Hell, yeah, first
is my middle name.

01:09:47.451 --> 01:09:49.517
- It is?
- No, sweetie, it's Olivia.

01:09:49.553 --> 01:09:51.229
- All right, let's do this.
On three...

01:09:51.254 --> 01:09:52.987
One, two, three, break!

01:09:53.023 --> 01:09:55.423
-Let's go!

01:09:55.459 --> 01:09:58.760
- And the black...
is in the lead.

01:10:02.733 --> 01:10:04.343
- You're killing it, Dad.
- Get your arms down there.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:06.768
Get away from me!

01:10:09.847 --> 01:10:12.273
- Look, Pop, I
just want to say I'm sorry.

01:10:12.309 --> 01:10:13.733
-No talking, just winning.

01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:17.023
- I'm not sorry-sorry,
but I'm sorry.

01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:25.278
- You can't keep up, can ya?
- Look...

01:10:25.313 --> 01:10:26.579
you're the one out of shape.

01:10:26.614 --> 01:10:28.374
- I'm not out of shape,
I could go for hours.

01:10:30.085 --> 01:10:34.253
-Hey. Wait...

01:10:34.289 --> 01:10:36.055
Is that a snake?
- Where?

01:10:36.091 --> 01:10:39.025
-Right there.

01:10:49.971 --> 01:10:50.971
-Oh...

01:10:52.507 --> 01:10:53.918
Oh, shit, that ain't
no damn snake.

01:10:53.942 --> 01:10:55.499
Oh.

01:10:55.535 --> 01:10:59.103
- You know your scream
was kind of a...

01:10:59.138 --> 01:11:01.305
hoo hoo, you know.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.074
You need to man up, you know.

01:11:03.109 --> 01:11:04.742
-Man up on this!

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:08.866
I should have told my family.

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:11.482
Well, I don't know what happened.
We just... fell in love.

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:14.585
- Yeah.
- My dad's so furious.

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.198
- Well, girl, your dad
be overreacting, okay,

01:11:16.222 --> 01:11:18.322
if you ask me.
- Yep.

01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:20.458
-I mean, it's not a bad thing,

01:11:20.493 --> 01:11:21.225
it's kind of a good thing.
- Really?

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:23.160
-I mean, I was in shock.

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:24.662
I was like, "What?"

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:26.475
I was clutching my purse
like I was watching

01:11:26.499 --> 01:11:28.599
"Days of Our Lives"
or something.

01:11:28.634 --> 01:11:30.434
I was like, "What?"
Did not see that coming!

01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:33.504
But... it's a good thing.
- Yeah.

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:35.740
- Y'all might make
some little Obamas,

01:11:35.742 --> 01:11:38.008
or something, little Baracks
up in here.

01:11:38.044 --> 01:11:42.012
Girl, all I can say is I think your
dad's acting like a big old kid.

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:46.276
- Right. Surprise, surprise, all
the men are acting like children.

01:11:46.311 --> 01:11:46.784
-And speaking of children...

01:11:46.819 --> 01:11:49.412
I cannot hear mine. It's like...
- Yeah, that is weird.

01:11:49.448 --> 01:11:51.648
- They real quiet,
like when I put

01:11:51.683 --> 01:11:53.428
a little bit of Benadryl
in their Cap'n Crunch.

01:11:53.452 --> 01:11:54.772
You know they get
real quiet then.

01:11:56.796 --> 01:12:00.423
What? I wouldn't really drug
my babies, that's a joke.

01:12:00.459 --> 01:12:03.460
- Okay, okay, I was like...

01:12:03.495 --> 01:12:05.128
- Just a little bit,
for a minute.

01:12:05.163 --> 01:12:06.963
Kids!
- Chuckie!

01:12:06.998 --> 01:12:08.364
-Rolie!

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.332
- Chuckie!
- They're not there.

01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:11.367
We should go.
- Let's go see.

01:12:11.403 --> 01:12:12.769
- Let's try to parent.
- Hey!

01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:21.202
Oh, my God!

01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:27.909
-Really? Seriously?

01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:30.120
-What?

01:12:30.155 --> 01:12:33.314
- You think they're going to shoot
dollar bills at you with a t-shirt gun?

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:35.550
-No, this is a public service.

01:12:35.585 --> 01:12:37.985
I do this for charity.
Not dollar bills.

01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:40.021
You drunk!

01:12:42.067 --> 01:12:44.537
- All right, nothing to see here.
Head down the trail, down the trail.

01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:46.594
Nothing to see here,
nothing to see here.

01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:47.428
We've got a race to run.
Come on, sweetie.

01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:49.764
Okay, I'm open.
Come on, let's go.

01:12:51.267 --> 01:12:53.634
Come on!

- What?
- Do you hear that?

01:13:52.044 --> 01:13:54.378
-Hear what?

01:13:54.413 --> 01:13:56.756
- What is that sound?
- Oh, shit!

01:13:56.791 --> 01:14:01.452
Well, maybe it's a bear
or, or even worse, a monster!

01:14:01.487 --> 01:14:02.927
Oh, damn, what's
behind those bushes?

01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:06.523
Oh, what beast
is coming towards us!

01:14:06.559 --> 01:14:08.270
Who are you! What are you!

01:14:08.294 --> 01:14:09.359
Show yourself!

01:14:09.395 --> 01:14:12.162
Oh, shit, worse than I thought.

01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:14.565
Just kidding, baby.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:14.774
- We're looking
for the kids, they ran off.

01:14:14.809 --> 01:14:18.335
- Is this some kind of joke,
'cause we're going to win?

01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:19.448
-Oh, really, I'm just curious,

01:14:19.472 --> 01:14:21.638
on what planet
might that be true?

01:14:21.674 --> 01:14:23.177
- Oh, I don't even know
how you got in the lead.

01:14:23.201 --> 01:14:25.435
-No, really, uh, uh...

01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:27.030
Shan... Shantay... what?
- Shantaysia.

01:14:28.473 --> 01:14:29.338
- Oh, Shantaysia.
- Can't get it right?

01:14:29.374 --> 01:14:31.174
-No, I thought it was Shantay...

01:14:34.112 --> 01:14:37.380
-Anyway, she...

01:14:37.415 --> 01:14:38.114
said something about the kids...

01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:40.349
and a finish line.

01:14:40.385 --> 01:14:43.052
- Wow! Is that a bat?
- Really?

01:14:43.088 --> 01:14:45.188
-Oh, Charlie.

01:14:45.223 --> 01:14:47.423
-Is that another bat?

01:14:47.459 --> 01:14:48.324
- I thought you
were going to quit.

01:14:48.359 --> 01:14:51.160
-No, no, no, wait, it that...

01:14:51.196 --> 01:14:52.695
Is that three bats?

01:14:52.731 --> 01:14:54.408
- I guess we'll never know
what we could've been.

01:14:54.432 --> 01:14:56.766
- No, no, no,
no booze, no bottle.

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:01.704
Five, five, five... five bats.

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:05.232
- Oh, my God. Seriously!
- No, no, no, I'm serious.

01:15:06.936 --> 01:15:08.002
-Bats!

01:15:21.826 --> 01:15:25.286
- We can't stop. They say
bats get stuck in your hair.

01:15:25.321 --> 01:15:27.154
-No, no, no. That's a myth.

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:29.123
Total urban legend.

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:31.225
- Oh, shit.
- Oh!

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.260
What?

01:15:33.596 --> 01:15:34.673
- There's a... there's
a bat on your head.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:38.432
- Guys, guys, guys, come
on, I'm not a moron.

01:15:38.468 --> 01:15:40.434
Clearly there's
no bat on my head.

01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:41.736
- How drunk are you?
- Irrelevant.

01:15:41.738 --> 01:15:44.638
- I promise you, son, there's
a bat in your hair.

01:15:44.674 --> 01:15:46.314
- Come on, Charlie!
- You don't feel that?

01:15:50.237 --> 01:15:53.672
-Get it off! Get it off!

01:15:53.708 --> 01:15:55.668
- Throw rocks at it,
everybody, throw rocks at it.

01:16:01.315 --> 01:16:02.281
-Enough with the damn rocks.

01:16:02.316 --> 01:16:04.316
-Hit it with the bug racket!

01:16:04.351 --> 01:16:05.351
Yeah!

01:16:12.293 --> 01:16:13.092
-Not my head, not my head!

01:16:13.127 --> 01:16:15.461
-Look, the kids!

01:16:15.496 --> 01:16:17.763
The finish line!

01:16:20.334 --> 01:16:22.367
-Oh, hey, thanks everybody!

01:16:22.403 --> 01:16:25.003
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's all good.

01:16:26.674 --> 01:16:29.734
- There was nothing
about that... that I liked!

01:17:03.737 --> 01:17:06.879
- You kids did this?
- Yeah! We don't want to go home.

01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:09.774
- Us kids get along, how come
you adults can't get along?

01:17:12.036 --> 01:17:13.745
-Well, wow.

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:16.881
This is some muddy bullshit.
But I'm damn impressed.

01:17:16.916 --> 01:17:19.086
Yeah, but who's
going to get a whooping first?

01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:20.643
-Kids! Not bad.

01:17:20.678 --> 01:17:24.280
You dug a hole, you
filled it with mud and...

01:17:24.315 --> 01:17:26.682
made it look like the trail.

01:17:26.718 --> 01:17:29.185
And you caught yourselves
a bunch of dumbass men.

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:31.420
You know what's funny?

01:17:31.456 --> 01:17:34.423
Everyone covered
in mud like this,

01:17:34.459 --> 01:17:36.258
you just can't
tell anybody apart.

01:17:36.294 --> 01:17:38.360
There's a lesson in that.

01:17:38.396 --> 01:17:41.964
A big obvious, freaking lesson.

01:17:41.999 --> 01:17:45.701
-Preach!

01:17:45.737 --> 01:17:49.271
- So, being that you can't
tell anybody apart...

01:17:49.307 --> 01:17:52.232
the bottom line is this...

01:17:52.268 --> 01:17:53.734
are you an asshole or not?

01:17:56.972 --> 01:17:59.573
-Uh-mmm.

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:01.186
- Choose wisely.
- So, let's not be assholes.

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:03.977
And let's all just...

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:06.447
get along.

01:18:06.482 --> 01:18:07.981
- In the words
of Rodney King, girl.

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:10.718
-La raza!

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.953
- What does that mean, baby?
- Just a Latin bonding.

01:18:12.988 --> 01:18:13.863
-Got it.

01:18:13.898 --> 01:18:19.159
- Hey, that was a really
really nice speech, Fake Mom.

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:21.662
-Oh, well, that's...

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:23.008
still doing the Fake Mom
stuff right after the...

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:26.266
-Cheyenne.

01:18:26.302 --> 01:18:29.036
-You called me by my name!

01:18:29.071 --> 01:18:30.237
Sweetheart!

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:32.573
I'm so touched by the...

01:18:32.608 --> 01:18:34.599
You know, I've always
felt that we had...

01:18:34.635 --> 01:18:37.169
Okay, don't hit on 16,
got it, don't hit on 16.

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:43.408
- They said that tomato juice
can get rid of skunk stink.

01:18:45.312 --> 01:18:47.479
-I hear the ice cream truck!

01:18:47.514 --> 01:18:48.413
Oh, that's beautiful, Gravy.

01:18:48.449 --> 01:18:50.415
- Hold up, hold up.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:18:50.451 --> 01:18:52.551
- Something's wrong
with my knee.

01:18:52.586 --> 01:18:54.130
Look, you're my brother, okay?

01:18:54.154 --> 01:18:55.420
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:55.456 --> 01:18:56.816
- Listen to me,
I'm talking to you.

01:18:57.458 --> 01:18:58.818
- Yes!
- Okay, and I love you, man.

01:19:00.694 --> 01:19:02.494
And someday you are going
to be married, bro.

01:19:02.529 --> 01:19:04.062
Because if anybody
can do it, you can.

01:19:04.098 --> 01:19:05.697
-You think so?

01:19:05.733 --> 01:19:07.510
- I think what he's trying
to say, Pop, is that...

01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:09.201
It's time to propose.

01:19:09.236 --> 01:19:10.236
You know, to Charlie.

01:19:13.574 --> 01:19:15.466
♪ Felipa's going
to get proposed to ♪

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:17.101
♪ Felipa's going to get
proposed to ♪

01:19:17.136 --> 01:19:19.503
You're next!

01:19:19.539 --> 01:19:22.506
- Well, Franklin,
you're down on one knee,

01:19:22.542 --> 01:19:24.408
I think you better
handle your business.

01:19:24.444 --> 01:19:27.445
- Felipa... just
follow your heart.

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:28.979
- What is this...
are you'll for real?

01:19:29.015 --> 01:19:31.282
-Oh... oh!

01:19:31.317 --> 01:19:33.117
- Do it, Franklin.
- Wow!

01:19:33.152 --> 01:19:34.752
-Do it, Franklin.

01:19:42.361 --> 01:19:44.361
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

01:19:44.397 --> 01:19:46.030
- You will?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:19:52.071 --> 01:19:53.938
- Oh!
- Yes!

01:20:18.222 --> 01:20:21.190
-Felipa! We need help!

01:20:21.225 --> 01:20:25.227
-I got you! I got you!

01:20:25.262 --> 01:20:26.762
-We're getting married!

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:43.403
- Excuse me. Hello.
- Hi. Hi. Hi.

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:46.173
- Everybody.
- I just want to say...

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:47.916
another 4th of July...

01:20:47.952 --> 01:20:51.144
here we are again, I'm just so
happy that we can all make it.

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.112
Yes.

01:20:52.147 --> 01:20:54.481
-All right. Yeah!

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:57.084
- Yay! Too bad Gravy
couldn't make it.

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:00.565
- What? Am I supposed
to be somewhere?

01:21:00.589 --> 01:21:04.191
- Just kidding, bro.
You're here. It's now.

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:05.559
-We're joking, Gravy.

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:08.128
- Um, hi, I'm Charlie
and I'm an alcoholic.

01:21:08.163 --> 01:21:09.229
Hi, Charlie.

01:21:09.264 --> 01:21:11.098
-I'm sorry, wrong group.

01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:15.135
- Oh, check out this bad boy.

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:17.237
-Six months sober.

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:21.634
- Look who the good
influence is over here.

01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:24.236
- It just looks like
a poker chip painted green.

01:21:24.272 --> 01:21:26.672
-Looks like a blue condom.

01:21:26.708 --> 01:21:29.442
- Uh-uh. No. That is an IUD.
That's what that is.

01:21:29.477 --> 01:21:31.544
- Oh, gosh,
I hope you washed it, man.

01:21:31.579 --> 01:21:32.078
- Baby, no, no, no.
It's just an onion ring.

01:21:32.113 --> 01:21:33.754
-An onion ring?

01:21:33.789 --> 01:21:36.716
- Yeah. You know, like from Mars.
You know, Mars has...

01:21:36.718 --> 01:21:39.418
- Mars? -Did you hear about
the restaurant on Mars?

01:21:39.454 --> 01:21:41.020
- What? -Good food,
no atmosphere.

01:21:42.798 --> 01:21:45.324
- Hey, you're getting the hang
of these jokes, Gravy.

01:21:45.359 --> 01:21:47.426
-I have a sobriety chip, too.

01:21:47.462 --> 01:21:49.836
- Oh, there we go.
- See this? Yup.

01:21:49.872 --> 01:21:54.500
Lord, grant me the serenity
to accept what I cannot change

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:57.503
and the courage
to change what I can,

01:21:57.538 --> 01:21:59.018
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

01:22:00.274 --> 01:22:03.275
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

01:22:03.311 --> 01:22:06.281
- Maybe he could grant you the ability to
change a light bulb in the house, right?

01:22:06.305 --> 01:22:08.072
Or put the toilet seat down?

01:22:08.107 --> 01:22:09.640
-Go, Trophy Mom.

01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:12.643
- Mmm-hmm. I know exactly
what you talking about.

01:22:12.678 --> 01:22:14.645
You wake up at 3:00
in the morning to go to pee

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.391
and then it's like
you've fallen into a hammock.

01:22:16.415 --> 01:22:18.157
Booty and everything, all wet.

01:22:18.192 --> 01:22:22.962
- Oh, ladies and gentlemen, and it looks
like the attitudes are heating up.

01:22:22.997 --> 01:22:27.291
Bring out the bullhorns, it is
time to go at it one more time.

01:22:27.326 --> 01:22:28.759
Round two, one year later.

01:22:32.565 --> 01:22:35.265
- Felipa, go ahead
and show us that ring.

01:22:35.301 --> 01:22:37.401
- Oh, yes, it's so heavy.

01:22:38.971 --> 01:22:40.771
-Damn!

01:22:42.508 --> 01:22:44.066
- Sorry.
- Okay, hun. Well, you know...

01:22:44.101 --> 01:22:45.809
-Very nice. Hey!

01:22:45.845 --> 01:22:49.337
Francesca's got a ring, too.
She got engaged with this guy.

01:22:49.373 --> 01:22:51.306
Go ahead, Franny, show 'em.

01:22:51.341 --> 01:22:53.117
Very nice.

01:22:53.152 --> 01:22:54.830
- Hey, when I become a millionaire,
that thing's gonna be huge, all right?

01:22:54.854 --> 01:22:59.056
- "A millionaire"? I'd be happy
if you were a hundredaire.

01:22:59.091 --> 01:23:03.719
- This idiot brother puts an air foil
on the back of my plumbing van.

01:23:03.721 --> 01:23:05.140
- Business has been kicking
ever since we did that.

01:23:05.164 --> 01:23:09.558
- Hey, Jose, could you shove that
antennae back into your love handle,

01:23:09.593 --> 01:23:11.426
I think the Giants
are playing the Dodgers.

01:23:11.462 --> 01:23:12.936
- Oh, ha-ha-ha.
Yeah, I can do that.

01:23:12.972 --> 01:23:15.452
You know, but I charge 14 bucks
for the premium channels, fool.

01:23:17.735 --> 01:23:20.435
- Hey, y'all kids, keep it
down over there! Okay?

01:23:20.471 --> 01:23:22.404
This is not a library!
- Chuckie!

01:23:22.439 --> 01:23:24.999
Quit hitting your sister Sara.

01:23:25.034 --> 01:23:26.500
Don't! Stop!

01:23:26.536 --> 01:23:28.180
- Can I hit you, Dad?
- Can I hit the dogs?

01:23:28.204 --> 01:23:29.503
-Can I hit a cupcake?

01:23:29.539 --> 01:23:31.179
- Me, too!
- I want to hit one of those...

01:23:34.644 --> 01:23:37.311
- All right. It's cool.
Just hit her, it's fine.

01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:39.213
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yes?

01:23:39.248 --> 01:23:40.748
- I have a toast.
- Ah!

01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:44.919
- All that I've ever
wanted to be...

01:23:46.222 --> 01:23:47.154
is whom I'm becoming.

01:23:47.190 --> 01:23:48.756
- Nice.
- Hear, hear.

01:23:50.226 --> 01:23:51.759
- Cheers.
- Hear, hear.

01:24:02.138 --> 01:24:04.105
- Uh-oh.
- Hey!

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:06.707
Hey, Gunga Din.

01:24:06.743 --> 01:24:08.743
What are you doing here?
This is our site. Site 16.

01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:10.502
- No way!
We have site 16.

01:24:10.538 --> 01:24:13.672
- Oh, are you going
to build a 7/11 here?

01:24:13.708 --> 01:24:15.285
- Yeah, right next to your nail salon.
- Oh, yeah.

01:24:15.309 --> 01:24:17.376
-Oh, snap! Y'all hear that?

01:24:17.411 --> 01:24:18.422
- What are you
people doing here?

01:24:18.446 --> 01:24:20.921
Finish up the gardening and go.

01:24:20.957 --> 01:24:23.982
- Hey, things are heating up down there.
I got one. I got one.

01:24:24.827 --> 01:24:27.986
How do you know a Chinese
guy broke into your house?

01:24:28.022 --> 01:24:30.164
How?

01:24:30.199 --> 01:24:33.258
Your homework's all done and he takes
an hour to pull out of your driveway.

01:24:33.294 --> 01:24:35.327
Get it?

01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:37.463
- Come on, man.
It's funny.

01:24:37.498 --> 01:24:39.431
- Did he just say that?
- Yeah, he did.

01:24:39.467 --> 01:24:40.827
- Let me see that.
Let me see that.

01:24:42.737 --> 01:24:44.047
- What did St. Peter say
when he saw the Indian guy?

01:24:44.071 --> 01:24:45.404
What?

01:24:45.439 --> 01:24:47.106
- "Hey, Jesus,
your cab's here."

01:24:49.301 --> 01:24:50.378
-That was funnier than that.

01:24:50.402 --> 01:24:52.502
- Okay, that's messed up.
- Yeah.

01:24:52.538 --> 01:24:55.639
- Hey, you guys still want
campsite 16?

01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:57.514
- Oh, I think we need to have
a little contest.

01:24:59.411 --> 01:25:00.744
- Contest?
- What kind of contest?

01:25:02.114 --> 01:25:04.247
-It's over now!

01:25:04.283 --> 01:25:07.517
-No math contest and no...

01:25:07.553 --> 01:25:09.419
- Yeah, no math
and no science questions.

01:25:09.455 --> 01:25:11.354
Yeah.
