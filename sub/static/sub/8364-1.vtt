02:57.858 --> 02:59.416
Shall we, Siya?

03:01.795 --> 03:03.285
l am scared.

03:03.463 --> 03:05.829
Siya, l'm sure you'll be just fine.

03:08.134 --> 03:10.068
l am with you too.

03:13.874 --> 03:16.138
Sir, everyone's waiting for you.

03:24.117 --> 03:25.209
Shall we?

03:37.931 --> 03:38.727
Hi. - Hello.

03:38.832 --> 03:40.026
Hello. - Hello.

03:40.100 --> 03:40.964
Congratulation.

03:41.067 --> 03:42.364
Thank you. - Hello.

04:10.297 --> 04:14.563
2 year ago l didn't just lose my
elder brother in the plane crash.

04:14.801 --> 04:19.363
ln fact, l also lost
my best friend my ideal,

04:19.606 --> 04:22.507
Few are fortunate to have
a brother like Vikram Diwan,

04:22.909 --> 04:24.501
l'm sure you are all thinking..

04:24.578 --> 04:26.546
..why l built this
hospital in his memory..

04:26.613 --> 04:29.480
..although l am a
successful hotelier.

04:30.684 --> 04:33.517
l would like to tell
you all a small story.

04:33.753 --> 04:36.722
l was just 8 years
old and Vikram was 13.

04:37.290 --> 04:38.723
He had a friend called Karan.

04:38.925 --> 04:41.723
Vikram would eat,
sleep and play with him.

04:42.162 --> 04:43.595
One day,
when l returned from school..

04:43.697 --> 04:44.959
..Vikram wasn't eating, because..

04:45.031 --> 04:46.623
..that day Karan didn't come home.

04:46.766 --> 04:49.735
Laterwe found out that
he was in the hospital.

04:50.136 --> 04:51.831
He had a problem with his liver.

04:52.439 --> 04:54.430
And there was just
one way to save him..

04:54.541 --> 04:56.099
..and that was to find a donor..

04:56.176 --> 04:58.167
..whose blood group matched with him.

04:59.412 --> 05:02.347
Vikram and Karan had
the same blood group.

05:03.149 --> 05:04.548
Vikram didn't think twice..

05:04.618 --> 05:06.745
..before deciding to
donate half of his liver..

05:06.820 --> 05:08.412
..in orderto save his friend.

05:11.391 --> 05:14.986
Since that day Vikram
became my role-model.

05:15.795 --> 05:17.660
He went to great-lengths..

05:17.764 --> 05:19.732
..in orderto help the needy.

05:19.966 --> 05:21.729
And so, every needy person..

05:21.801 --> 05:25.999
..will receive free help
at Vikram Diwam Memorial Hospital.

05:34.547 --> 05:37.141
This is the first time when l feel..

05:37.784 --> 05:41.242
..l managed to become
somewhat like him.

05:43.056 --> 05:45.047
Sir, the News lndia personnel's
are waiting. - Yeah!

05:46.393 --> 05:48.361
Ma'am, the News
lndia representatives..

05:48.428 --> 05:50.658
..are ready forthe one-on-one
interview with you.

05:52.666 --> 05:53.792
ls it necessary?

05:54.067 --> 05:55.762
No need to worry.

05:57.470 --> 05:58.835
Just be honest.

06:01.041 --> 06:01.803
Yes.

06:03.977 --> 06:06.775
Hello, this is Priya
Verma for News lndia.

06:07.047 --> 06:08.912
ln today's special program..

06:09.015 --> 06:11.984
..we'll be talking about
Women's Empowerment.

06:12.485 --> 06:13.816
We are reporting live..

06:13.887 --> 06:17.118
..from Vikram Diwan Memorial
Super-Specialty Hospital..

06:17.223 --> 06:20.488
..that was inaugurated moments ago.

06:22.662 --> 06:24.323
Our special guest forthe day..

06:24.431 --> 06:29.926
..is the woman that helped Aditya
Diwan in fulfilling his dreams.

06:30.270 --> 06:31.601
Mrs. Siya Diwan.

06:31.738 --> 06:33.535
First of all..hearty congratulations..

06:33.640 --> 06:35.608
..on the inauguration
of this hospital.

06:35.675 --> 06:36.505
Thank you.

06:37.077 --> 06:40.137
lt's said that behind every
successful man is a woman.

06:40.346 --> 06:43.144
So are you the woman
behind Aditya Diwan's success?

06:49.089 --> 06:50.488
l don't think so!

06:52.459 --> 06:55.428
l don't think that a
woman ever stays in shadows.

06:55.862 --> 06:56.954
So l would say that..

06:57.163 --> 06:59.097
..l am the woman who's always been..

06:59.165 --> 07:01.224
..besides the success
of Aditya Diwan.

07:01.701 --> 07:03.032
And not behind him!

07:06.039 --> 07:11.636
Mrs. Diwan..one of the responsibilities
of the press is to destroy rumors.

07:12.378 --> 07:14.471
We've heard that
priorto your marriage..

07:14.681 --> 07:18.947
..you had an affairwith
Aditya's elder brother Vikram.

07:19.786 --> 07:20.980
ls this true or not?

07:26.259 --> 07:28.784
Yes..it's true.

07:29.496 --> 07:30.963
And it's not a rumor.

07:31.765 --> 07:33.062
When Vikram died..

07:33.133 --> 07:35.192
..l was pregnant with his child.

07:36.202 --> 07:38.261
But we weren't married yet.

07:39.139 --> 07:41.073
And Aditya didn't
want Vikram's child..

07:41.141 --> 07:43.575
..to stay devoid of his family name.

07:44.344 --> 07:46.175
That's why he married me.

07:51.017 --> 07:54.714
But after sometime
l suffered a miscarriage.

07:55.588 --> 07:57.317
And l lost my baby too.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.385
Maybe God didn't want me..

08:02.595 --> 08:05.758
..to have any insignia of my past.

08:10.403 --> 08:11.597
But that same God..

08:11.771 --> 08:14.501
..made a man like
Aditya my companion..

08:14.841 --> 08:17.503
..so that l can move on in life.

08:50.543 --> 08:59.884
"l'm obsessed..to make you mine."

09:00.053 --> 09:02.578
"Since long."

09:03.656 --> 09:10.562
"Make me a bad habit.."

09:10.797 --> 09:15.598
"is what l have to say to you."

09:37.523 --> 09:42.586
"Let a wave of sensation run down.."

09:42.795 --> 09:47.630
"my otherwise calm body."

09:47.967 --> 09:50.629
"Let me stare into those.."

09:50.737 --> 09:57.768
..mesmerizing eyes..that
are as deep as an abyss.

09:57.844 --> 10:03.305
Let's get wet in
the deluge of desires.

10:03.383 --> 10:06.750
"Come.."

10:07.253 --> 10:16.594
l'm obsessed with..never
letting you go..ever.

10:16.829 --> 10:19.354
"Since long."

10:20.466 --> 10:27.269
"Let me dwell in your eyes.."

10:27.440 --> 10:33.037
"is what l have to say to you."

10:56.502 --> 10:58.936
"Don't stop me.."

10:59.372 --> 11:01.932
"l am completely obsessed now."

11:02.041 --> 11:07.104
"That's how crazy l am."

11:07.380 --> 11:09.940
"Take a look.."

11:10.049 --> 11:12.540
"at my condition too."

11:12.685 --> 11:16.883
l'm completely
shattered to pieces.

11:17.123 --> 11:19.648
"There's no turning back now."

11:19.792 --> 11:22.784
"Whateverthis is, it feels right."

11:22.895 --> 11:26.160
"Come.."

11:26.599 --> 11:35.769
l'm obsessed
with..becoming with you.

11:36.009 --> 11:38.773
"Since long."

11:39.779 --> 11:46.514
"Let me stay close to you.."

11:46.753 --> 11:51.918
"is what l have to say to you."

11:53.092 --> 12:02.433
"l'm obsessed..to make you mine."

12:02.535 --> 12:05.095
"Since long."

12:05.238 --> 12:10.540
"l'm obsessed..since long."

12:31.030 --> 12:33.225
The Hong Kong delegates
are on theirway from the airport.

12:33.332 --> 12:35.732
And..they'll be here in 15 minutes.

12:40.807 --> 12:41.569
Thank you sir.

12:44.710 --> 12:47.645
Kaaya, l want you
to head this meeting.

12:47.747 --> 12:50.716
Aditya,
this is a 50 million project.

12:50.950 --> 12:53.350
And if anything goes wrong..

12:53.586 --> 12:56.646
..our company will never
be able to bearthe loss.

12:56.989 --> 13:00.152
And l think..l'm not yet capable.

13:00.326 --> 13:04.194
Kaaya..l know you're more
capable than you think you are.

13:04.397 --> 13:07.560
Two years ago you joined
this company as a secretary.

13:07.800 --> 13:11.236
And now..you're perfectly
handling all my big companies.

13:11.404 --> 13:12.336
And let's not forget..

13:12.405 --> 13:16.136
..the way you handled
the advertisement department..

13:16.209 --> 13:19.144
..of our Soft Drink,
it's increased our sales by 7 fold.

13:20.346 --> 13:22.143
So go ahead and head the meeting.

13:22.782 --> 13:23.874
All the best.

13:24.283 --> 13:26.410
l don't know how to thank you, but..

13:26.486 --> 13:27.578
Thank you!

13:30.423 --> 13:32.015
l can't believe my eyes.

13:32.625 --> 13:34.149
What did you possibly see, Mr.
Vaswani?

13:34.260 --> 13:36.091
lt's hard to believe
that some random person..

13:36.195 --> 13:37.594
..can gift you
something so expensive.

13:37.663 --> 13:39.893
What gift? Show me.

13:40.266 --> 13:43.235
Sir, it's as big as it's expensive.

13:43.669 --> 13:44.260
What?

13:44.370 --> 13:47.032
l mean you must come down
to see it for yourself.

14:15.868 --> 14:17.028
Who is it, sir?

14:18.838 --> 14:19.634
Find out..

14:25.778 --> 14:27.439
Saurav Singhania!

14:28.514 --> 14:30.106
Never heard of him before.

14:30.316 --> 14:31.305
What does he do?

14:31.684 --> 14:32.776
Vaswani was saying..

14:32.852 --> 14:35.320
..he's the owner of some
Group of lnternational Funds.

14:35.788 --> 14:37.983
And also owns some
lron and Steel Factories.

14:39.192 --> 14:40.250
lmpressive.

14:40.459 --> 14:42.393
And the reason forthis favor.

14:42.461 --> 14:45.589
To find that out why l
accepted his lunch invitation.

14:45.865 --> 14:47.332
Lunch invitation?

14:48.067 --> 14:50.934
He's invited us both
at his office.

14:51.404 --> 14:53.338
You'll come along too.. - No.

14:54.106 --> 14:54.731
Why?

14:55.241 --> 14:57.141
What will l do out there?

14:57.443 --> 15:00.503
And anyway, these business
meetings are very boring.

15:00.613 --> 15:01.341
l see.

15:01.847 --> 15:02.711
Are you trying to tell me..

15:02.815 --> 15:04.112
..you don't want to meet a person..

15:04.217 --> 15:07.015
..who gifts an Audi
to someone he doesn't know.

15:09.222 --> 15:10.849
l would..

15:11.457 --> 15:13.652
By the way, is he handsome?

15:15.161 --> 15:18.494
Handsome is what
handsome does, baby.

15:54.634 --> 15:55.999
Welcome!

16:00.606 --> 16:02.631
Welcome to my Kingdom!

16:20.593 --> 16:22.356
Thank you for accepting
my invitation.

16:22.561 --> 16:25.086
Thank you..for inviting us.

16:25.765 --> 16:27.027
Pleasure's all mine.

16:28.301 --> 16:29.393
This is Mr. Dixit.

16:29.669 --> 16:31.466
He looks after my entire business.

16:33.639 --> 16:34.833
You must be wondering..

16:34.907 --> 16:36.306
..why l was so eagerto meet you two.

16:39.445 --> 16:41.310
Well..l've something to show you.

17:11.210 --> 17:13.770
l guess..even we don't
know this much about ourselves.

17:14.012 --> 17:18.608
May l ask..why you're
so interested in our lives?

17:19.318 --> 17:22.116
You can say that l'm a Fan!

17:23.622 --> 17:27.422
Only Filmstars and Cricketers have
fans in this country, Mr. Singhania.

17:28.728 --> 17:30.628
This is the first time when l heard..

17:31.063 --> 17:32.860
..that even businessmen have fans.

17:33.332 --> 17:35.459
Well, actually..l'm
a fan of every person..

17:35.634 --> 17:38.626
..who achieved something
in life on their own.

17:40.573 --> 17:44.168
The way..you brought
your business to such heights..

17:44.243 --> 17:46.370
..after losing your
father and brother..

17:46.612 --> 17:47.738
..its remarkable.

17:48.614 --> 17:51.378
You have really
great business sense.

17:51.884 --> 17:54.785
We were supposed to talk business.

17:55.454 --> 17:56.182
Yes.

17:57.556 --> 17:59.387
ls it okay if l borrow
your husband for a minute?

17:59.692 --> 18:00.420
Sure.

18:02.228 --> 18:04.753
Mr. Dixit, show Mrs.
Siya around the office.

18:08.033 --> 18:08.863
Please.

18:09.201 --> 18:10.259
Let's have a drink.

18:11.036 --> 18:13.266
Scotch! Vodka! Bourbon!

18:13.873 --> 18:15.704
Malt! - Excellent.

18:18.811 --> 18:23.578
Do you the difference
between..birds ad humans?

18:25.518 --> 18:27.850
Birds build a nest..

18:29.588 --> 18:31.453
..which big enough forthem.

18:33.926 --> 18:35.120
And humans..

18:35.628 --> 18:38.859
Well, humans are never
happy with their home.

18:40.199 --> 18:41.666
They want to make it bigger.

18:42.635 --> 18:44.000
Like l am sure..

18:44.870 --> 18:46.735
..you want to expand
your business as well.

18:49.275 --> 18:53.075
And l want to help
you fulfill this dream.

18:53.712 --> 18:56.909
l'll give you all
the money you need.

18:58.350 --> 19:00.841
Diwan's is a big name..

19:01.153 --> 19:04.145
..and every bank and financial
institution lineup at my door..

19:04.957 --> 19:06.481
..to lend us money.

19:08.794 --> 19:09.624
Cheers.

19:10.930 --> 19:12.124
See that's true.

19:12.498 --> 19:13.829
But forthe money you borrow..

19:13.933 --> 19:18.529
..you'll have to mortgage
your property, and pay interest.

19:19.538 --> 19:21.233
Every creditor does that.

19:22.508 --> 19:23.805
But not me.

19:24.543 --> 19:26.101
There's no guarantee..

19:26.312 --> 19:28.007
No mortgage.. No interest.

19:30.616 --> 19:32.015
Are you out of your mind?

19:32.418 --> 19:34.613
You'll lend me money without
any guarantee or interest?

19:35.387 --> 19:37.150
And whatever amount you want.

19:40.392 --> 19:41.757
But why will you do it?

19:42.394 --> 19:43.361
Why just you?

19:43.729 --> 19:45.219
Why would anyone do such a thing?

19:45.631 --> 19:47.155
l don't know about the rest..

19:47.233 --> 19:48.723
..but l am a businessman.

19:48.968 --> 19:50.663
And this is a business deal.

19:51.604 --> 19:52.536
What deal?

19:54.874 --> 19:56.671
This is a signed cheque.

19:57.142 --> 19:59.610
You can fill in whatever
amount you like.

20:01.614 --> 20:03.878
Just send Siya overfor one night.

20:04.183 --> 20:05.445
Rascal!

20:06.752 --> 20:07.946
l will kill you.

20:10.189 --> 20:11.622
How dare you?

20:12.024 --> 20:17.621
No one's ever dared to mention
Siya's name in front of me.

20:18.397 --> 20:20.262
Don't make this mistake again..

20:20.366 --> 20:23.164
..or else next time you
won't get time to regret.

20:23.636 --> 20:25.103
You're new in this city.

20:25.838 --> 20:28.033
Take my advice and leave.

20:28.641 --> 20:31.007
As long as Aditya Diwan's here..

20:31.644 --> 20:36.274
..you can never breathe
a sigh of relief.

20:40.185 --> 20:41.652
We shall see.

20:42.821 --> 20:44.015
We shall!

20:53.799 --> 20:54.823
Siya, let's go.

20:55.234 --> 20:57.429
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Let's just go.

20:57.503 --> 20:58.492
Aditya, what happened?

21:14.787 --> 21:16.254
The game's begun.

21:43.048 --> 21:45.141
Hey..are you blind?

21:51.056 --> 21:53.149
This isn't obstruction..

21:53.626 --> 21:55.821
..it's a doorto a
betterfuture, Satya.

21:56.362 --> 21:58.660
How do you know my name?

21:59.665 --> 22:01.895
Your brother Raghunath
Kamath is in jail, isn't he?

22:02.568 --> 22:06.436
- Yes..but how do you know?
- Leave that.

22:07.473 --> 22:10.931
Look..your brother's bail papers.

22:14.446 --> 22:16.073
You must do something for me..

22:17.449 --> 22:19.314
..if you want to
see your brotherfree.

22:20.786 --> 22:21.753
What job?

22:31.597 --> 22:32.621
More. - Yeah.

22:32.931 --> 22:34.626
You go ahead, l'lljoin you.

22:34.733 --> 22:35.665
What's wrong?

22:35.968 --> 22:37.230
Aren't you coming along for lunch?

22:37.469 --> 22:40.563
No, Akash sir asked
me to do something.

22:40.639 --> 22:41.799
l'll go deal with that first.

22:42.074 --> 22:43.234
Go ahead, l'm coming.

22:43.776 --> 22:46.745
l'll go, come soon. - Yes.

23:14.173 --> 23:16.437
You took 21 runs in an over.

23:16.842 --> 23:18.537
And what about the fact that
l got you clean bold. - Shut up.

23:24.550 --> 23:25.380
Harshit. - Harshit.

23:25.451 --> 23:26.816
Harshit. - What happened?

23:27.019 --> 23:28.884
Harshit. Harshit. - What happened?

23:28.987 --> 23:30.648
Harshit. What's wrong? - Tell us.

23:30.823 --> 23:32.552
Yes, sir. Right, sir.

23:32.791 --> 23:34.224
Okay, that will be done, sir.

23:34.359 --> 23:35.189
Thank you, sir.

23:36.261 --> 23:38.286
Right. - Aditya!
Something's definitely wrong.

23:38.464 --> 23:40.762
We're receiving many complaints
regarding our soft drinks.

23:40.866 --> 23:41.628
What complaints?

23:41.900 --> 23:43.765
Some kids started puking
after drinking our soft-drinks..

23:43.969 --> 23:44.993
..and some fell sick.

23:45.070 --> 23:46.765
And our sources
in the Secretariat..

23:46.839 --> 23:48.272
..have informed us that
there's going to be an lnquiry.

23:48.407 --> 23:49.396
l mean l am just
not understanding..

23:49.475 --> 23:50.567
..how is this possible!

23:54.046 --> 23:58.813
Aditya Diwan. - Down! Down!

23:59.318 --> 24:01.650
Please..stay back.
Please.

24:02.788 --> 24:07.623
Please stay back.
l said stay back.

24:08.260 --> 24:12.788
Back. Stay back.
Move back.

24:13.098 --> 24:17.398
Move. Move.
Stay back.

24:18.003 --> 24:20.335
Stay back. Move.

24:20.706 --> 24:22.003
Stop making this poison!

24:22.074 --> 24:24.008
Shut it down!

24:24.076 --> 24:25.737
Stop making this poison!

24:25.844 --> 24:27.471
Shut it down!

24:27.546 --> 24:29.241
Stop making this poison!

24:29.314 --> 24:31.305
Shut it down!

24:31.850 --> 24:33.112
Mr. Aditya Diwan..

24:34.019 --> 24:35.486
We must take the latest
batch of your soft drinks..

24:35.554 --> 24:37.215
..to our Lab fortesting.

24:37.523 --> 24:39.218
And you must shut
down yourfactory..

24:39.424 --> 24:41.153
..until we don't get the results.

24:42.528 --> 24:44.325
Shut it down!

24:45.130 --> 24:47.291
Shut it down!

24:48.167 --> 24:49.225
Okay, lnspector.

24:50.502 --> 24:52.732
Even l don't want anyone
falling sick after drinking this.

24:53.705 --> 24:55.502
- l am ready to cooperate.
- Thank you.

24:56.642 --> 24:57.540
Officer.

24:58.143 --> 25:01.579
Shut it down! Shut it down!

25:02.881 --> 25:04.644
These people only
know how to make profit.

25:04.950 --> 25:06.645
They would even sell poison
if they profited from it.

25:06.718 --> 25:07.650
They are selling us poison.

25:07.753 --> 25:09.448
Such people should be hanged.

25:10.856 --> 25:12.187
As you can see the huge crowd..

25:12.357 --> 25:16.453
..that has gathered behind
us and they're clearly furious.

25:16.595 --> 25:18.722
The Police as sent
the latest batch..

25:29.942 --> 25:31.603
Hello. - Hello, Ms. Siya.

25:32.110 --> 25:32.906
Who is this?

25:33.645 --> 25:35.636
What? You forgot me so soon?

25:36.281 --> 25:37.441
Saurav Singhania.

25:39.284 --> 25:40.114
Yes.

25:40.452 --> 25:41.942
How did you like my second gift?

25:42.154 --> 25:44.145
Gift? What gift?

25:44.356 --> 25:47.723
Oh..so Aditya didn't
tell you anything.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.356
About what?

25:49.728 --> 25:52.253
The thing that can
solve all your problems.

25:53.265 --> 25:56.166
Hatred can turn into love if..

25:56.735 --> 26:00.227
lf.. lf you want!

26:01.139 --> 26:02.663
What do you mean?

26:03.175 --> 26:06.110
Actually..you should
ask your husband.

26:08.680 --> 26:09.977
He'll tell you.

26:35.974 --> 26:38.374
You were all overthe News today.

26:39.411 --> 26:41.106
You must be really worried.

26:43.315 --> 26:44.282
Part of the job.

26:45.951 --> 26:48.476
Keeping things from me must
also be part of your job, right?

26:49.521 --> 26:52.388
What did l hide from you?

26:53.358 --> 26:56.521
You nevertold me
what happened between..

26:57.696 --> 26:59.721
..you and Saurav Singhania that day?

27:00.098 --> 27:01.895
He's crazy? Stop thinking about him.

27:02.034 --> 27:03.433
He's done all this!

27:06.305 --> 27:07.101
What?

27:07.239 --> 27:09.400
Everything that's happening
in our soft-drink factory..

27:09.508 --> 27:10.440
..it's a sabotage.

27:10.642 --> 27:12.109
He's behind it all.

27:12.577 --> 27:15.045
Who told you? - He told me himself.

27:15.247 --> 27:16.839
He called. - What did he say?

27:17.015 --> 27:19.984
That you know why
you're doing all this.

27:20.585 --> 27:23.952
And if l want..then
all this isn't needed.

27:24.389 --> 27:25.788
Siya, just forget it.

27:26.758 --> 27:27.656
Why?

27:27.759 --> 27:29.624
What does he want?

27:29.995 --> 27:32.555
- Why don't you tell me?
- l can't tell you.

27:33.432 --> 27:36.196
Aditya, please. Tell me.

27:49.147 --> 27:50.808
He wants to..

27:52.050 --> 27:53.517
..spend a night with you.

27:57.889 --> 27:59.880
That's what that
bloody rascal wants.

28:01.860 --> 28:03.521
And that's why he's..

28:04.629 --> 28:05.687
Siya..

28:06.331 --> 28:08.925
He's a vulgar scoundrel
with a lot of money.

28:10.035 --> 28:14.131
No Aditya,
that can't be the only reason.

28:16.041 --> 28:17.872
l am sure there's
something more to it.

28:19.311 --> 28:24.908
Maybe he's saying all this
to provoke you, confuse you..

28:25.183 --> 28:27.151
..and hiding his true motive.

28:27.953 --> 28:29.352
Find out, Aditya.

28:30.355 --> 28:31.287
Find out!

28:44.536 --> 28:47.437
"When l don't get.."

28:49.608 --> 28:52.168
"to touch you."

28:53.578 --> 28:58.606
"When l don't get the
liberty..to touch you."

28:58.683 --> 29:02.881
"l get that liberty..in my dreams."

29:03.221 --> 29:07.453
But even in my dreams..when
l try to touch you.

29:07.559 --> 29:09.424
"l wake up."

29:18.437 --> 29:23.500
Aren't you ashamed..of
talking dirty like this.

29:23.608 --> 29:27.772
Don't your mom and your
sisterteach you anything?

29:28.046 --> 29:32.642
My honor's saved,
thank the Lord..

29:32.717 --> 29:34.912
"that you wake up."

29:35.921 --> 29:39.288
"Meet Bros."

29:40.525 --> 29:44.052
"Meet Bros."

29:45.497 --> 29:50.025
Let me touch your body..and
it'll change your gait.

29:50.102 --> 29:52.229
"Touch my lips with yours."

29:52.304 --> 29:54.499
"And it'll melt your heart."

29:54.606 --> 29:58.940
lgnore these shenanigans
and fill my arms.

29:59.044 --> 30:03.538
Forget all yourworries,
and let's enjoy life.

30:03.648 --> 30:08.676
l can understand..your
naughty behavior.

30:08.753 --> 30:12.883
Don't your mom and your
sisterteach you anything?

30:13.258 --> 30:17.820
My honor's saved,
thank the Lord..

30:17.896 --> 30:19.693
"that you wake up."

30:42.320 --> 30:44.185
"Your kiss is really killer."

30:44.289 --> 30:46.519
l hope it doesn't
turn into a love-bite.

30:46.591 --> 30:48.752
"l am scared of your intentions."

30:48.860 --> 30:51.328
"You might turn my days into nights."

30:51.396 --> 30:53.364
"Stop flirting.."

30:53.465 --> 30:55.524
"why are you after me?"

30:55.867 --> 31:00.065
l know how to cure
yourfever of love.

31:00.138 --> 31:04.905
Why do you make promises
and break it every day.

31:05.177 --> 31:09.739
And come in my dreams
to lure my heart again.

31:09.814 --> 31:13.978
But even in my dreams..when
l try to touch you.

31:14.085 --> 31:16.417
"l wake up."

31:38.310 --> 31:39.937
This soft-drink incident..

31:40.011 --> 31:42.707
..has ruined the image
of our other companies.

31:43.582 --> 31:45.447
Not only did we have
to stop production..

31:45.517 --> 31:49.180
..in fact, we had to call back
the stock in the market as well.

31:50.689 --> 31:52.554
There must be a way.

31:54.326 --> 31:55.350
There is one.

31:56.561 --> 31:57.493
What's that?

31:58.964 --> 31:59.931
Vaswani.

32:12.777 --> 32:14.472
Aditya.. - Look, Kaaya.

32:15.580 --> 32:18.378
l want you to resign
and take the blame.

32:18.717 --> 32:19.615
This is the only way..

32:19.718 --> 32:21.686
..to save our companies
from total annihilation.

32:21.786 --> 32:24.687
You know l am innocent.
l didn't do anything.

32:24.756 --> 32:25.814
l know.

32:27.892 --> 32:30.986
But someone otherthan me
will have to take responsibility.

32:32.097 --> 32:33.621
And l can't trust anyone else.

32:34.366 --> 32:36.334
You see..the company
will take good care of you.

32:36.434 --> 32:37.992
You will keep getting your salary..

32:38.103 --> 32:39.365
..in fact for lifetime.

32:39.904 --> 32:41.201
And the Law can't touch you..

32:41.306 --> 32:43.035
..we will get the
best team for your case.

32:43.141 --> 32:44.938
And what if l don't agree.

32:45.810 --> 32:47.243
Sorry, you don't have a choice.

32:47.812 --> 32:49.973
The company has already
released a press statement..

32:50.048 --> 32:52.778
..stating that you're
responsible for everything.

33:02.661 --> 33:05.596
You know what Aditya,
you're a real scoundrel.

33:06.131 --> 33:09.100
And l don't need yourfake sympathy.

33:09.868 --> 33:13.133
And yes..keep this
salary for yourself,

33:13.305 --> 33:14.863
You might need it.

33:35.894 --> 33:37.384
Stop. Stop.

33:37.696 --> 33:39.357
Ms. Kaaya,
did you already know..

33:39.431 --> 33:41.331
that the cold drink
wasn't fit for drinking.

33:41.399 --> 33:43.731
Ms. Kaaya..please..

33:46.004 --> 33:50.737
Aditya has foiled your plans
by blaming Kaaya for everything.

33:53.144 --> 33:54.702
This is the just the beginning.

33:56.047 --> 33:59.141
How long can he hide
behind innocent women.

34:02.053 --> 34:04.453
We're getting late for
the Business Chamber Summit.

34:04.622 --> 34:05.953
l think we should leave.

34:12.263 --> 34:13.855
This girl, Kaaya..

34:14.666 --> 34:17.032
Call her,
l want to talk business with her.

34:51.936 --> 34:52.664
Welcome.

34:53.138 --> 34:54.161
Thank you.

34:56.541 --> 34:58.475
l am Dixit. - Hi.

34:58.977 --> 35:00.911
l hope you had a pleasant journey.

35:01.246 --> 35:02.372
Everything was fine.

35:02.847 --> 35:04.144
Please come. - Thank you.

35:06.551 --> 35:09.486
Please come,
l'll show you your room.

35:14.492 --> 35:15.754
Please come.

35:17.162 --> 35:18.288
Mr. Singhania is really happy..

35:18.363 --> 35:20.456
..that you accepted his invitation.

35:22.200 --> 35:24.065
But he's also apologized.

35:24.469 --> 35:26.528
He couldn't receive
you personally..

35:26.805 --> 35:28.739
..because he was
busy in his meetings.

35:29.174 --> 35:30.471
lt's okay, l can understand.

35:31.309 --> 35:34.904
Mr. Singhania would like
you to have dinnerwith him tonight.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.511
Of course. - Thank you.

35:39.417 --> 35:41.009
Cheers. - Cheers.

35:45.890 --> 35:47.585
Thank you for accepting
my invitation.

35:48.092 --> 35:49.559
Thank you forthis
beautiful evening.

35:51.362 --> 35:54.991
l believe..if things
are done from the heart..

35:55.733 --> 35:58.133
..the result is always beautiful.

35:59.204 --> 36:00.000
True.

36:01.639 --> 36:03.539
l want to offer you something.

36:05.210 --> 36:06.199
From my heart..

36:09.714 --> 36:10.442
Friendship.

36:10.782 --> 36:12.545
l don't make friends so soon.

36:13.518 --> 36:16.180
And anyway, you're not
interesting in my friendship.

36:17.856 --> 36:18.788
What do you mean?

36:19.190 --> 36:23.217
Just that l know
you want to use me..

36:23.428 --> 36:26.192
..to ruin Aditya Diwan.

36:28.132 --> 36:31.226
After all..the enemy
of my enemy is a friend.

36:34.739 --> 36:35.763
Wow..

36:37.208 --> 36:38.869
Beauty and brains..

36:40.278 --> 36:42.041
You must be very dangerous.

36:42.614 --> 36:44.343
Not as dangerous as you.

36:45.683 --> 36:47.173
But my brains tell me that..

36:47.252 --> 36:49.743
..you're ready to
pay any price forthis.

36:50.655 --> 36:54.819
But Mr. Singhania l am not for sale.

36:56.494 --> 36:58.826
Who are you still
being loyal to, Kaaya?

36:59.464 --> 37:01.864
Someone who humiliated you..

37:01.966 --> 37:03.866
..and chucked you
out of his company.

37:05.003 --> 37:07.198
l don't think about profit
and loss while making friends.

37:08.306 --> 37:09.705
What's done is done.

37:10.842 --> 37:12.605
Anyway, what's the offer?

37:14.646 --> 37:18.241
Double..of whatever
Aditya's giving you.

37:19.384 --> 37:20.112
Not interested.

37:20.418 --> 37:23.387
Fourtimes more. - Not interested!

37:24.022 --> 37:25.455
Any figure you want, tell me.

37:26.491 --> 37:27.116
No.

37:32.730 --> 37:34.095
You wouldn't have come here..

37:34.165 --> 37:35.757
..if you weren't
interested in my offer.

37:36.601 --> 37:37.761
And it's impossible that you're..

37:37.869 --> 37:39.700
..uninterested in my
offer after coming here.

37:41.172 --> 37:44.608
That only means that..l
am asking the wrong question.

37:46.744 --> 37:51.010
Right question is..
what do you want?

37:57.822 --> 37:59.687
My flight leaves tomorrow morning.

38:00.592 --> 38:02.617
And you have until
tomorrow morning..

38:02.827 --> 38:05.557
..to figure out..what l want.

38:06.397 --> 38:07.227
Goodnight.

38:28.219 --> 38:31.052
l hope you liked our hospitality.

38:31.389 --> 38:32.788
lt was betterthan l expected.

38:33.124 --> 38:34.455
Thank you. - Yes.

38:34.993 --> 38:37.461
l wanted you to be
my guest a little longer.

38:42.934 --> 38:44.401
But you were right..

38:46.237 --> 38:48.569
No one can put a price-tag
on ourfriendship.

38:48.973 --> 38:49.837
lt's alright.

38:50.074 --> 38:51.598
Thank you forthe wonderful stay.

38:52.810 --> 38:54.141
Aditya killed my sister!

39:05.823 --> 39:08.883
Our parents died in a
car-crash when we were young.

39:11.496 --> 39:14.693
Since then l raised
Sangita as my daughter.

39:16.934 --> 39:19.596
She met Aditya in college.

39:21.406 --> 39:22.304
And they became friends.

39:22.373 --> 39:24.898
Soon theirfriendship
blossomed into love.

39:27.412 --> 39:29.812
Aditya meant everything for Sangita.

39:31.182 --> 39:32.410
But he..

39:36.187 --> 39:37.984
.. he just used her like a slave.

39:42.260 --> 39:45.229
Sangita couldn't tolerate this..

39:45.329 --> 39:47.354
..and she killed herself
by consuming poison.

39:52.336 --> 39:53.826
l still rememberthat night..

39:55.406 --> 39:57.533
..when l rushed to her room.

40:01.279 --> 40:02.405
My sister died..

40:05.583 --> 40:07.414
..in my arms.

40:11.856 --> 40:13.687
That day l decided..

40:16.294 --> 40:18.057
No matterwhat..

40:20.164 --> 40:21.791
..l will destroy Aditya Diwan.

40:41.819 --> 40:44.117
lf you know the price
of my friendship..

40:44.288 --> 40:47.189
..you should know that
l can even die for you.

40:54.198 --> 40:57.463
This hard disk has all the
information about Aditya's business.

40:59.637 --> 41:01.434
lt will help you destroy him.

41:10.148 --> 41:11.080
Thank you.

41:16.821 --> 41:20.222
And yes,
my motive behind coming here..

41:20.291 --> 41:22.350
..was to know the reason
behind your silence.

41:23.127 --> 41:24.617
And now this reason..

41:24.829 --> 41:29.926
..has compelled me
to know you better.

41:36.407 --> 41:37.806
Give me..
Give me.. Give me Love..

41:37.875 --> 41:38.864
"Then Give me more."

41:38.943 --> 41:41.537
"Take some love from me too."

41:41.612 --> 41:44.172
My lover gave you
down and l feeling low.

41:44.248 --> 41:46.239
"Again and again and again.."

41:46.317 --> 41:50.117
What's danger,
what danger, what danger.

41:50.288 --> 41:51.516
"Take me down, down, down.."

41:51.622 --> 41:55.422
What's danger,
what danger, what danger.

41:55.493 --> 41:57.085
"Take me down, down, down.."

42:00.398 --> 42:02.093
"Take me down, down, down.."

42:05.770 --> 42:07.101
"Take me down, down, down.."

42:07.238 --> 42:10.366
"Show me that you can love."

42:10.474 --> 42:12.999
"O Baby, take me in your arms."

42:13.177 --> 42:14.906
Everything l ever
imagined in my dreams..

42:15.046 --> 42:17.674
"O baby just do all that."

42:17.849 --> 42:20.647
"Show me that you can love."

42:21.085 --> 42:23.849
"O Baby, take me in your arms."

42:23.921 --> 42:25.582
Everything l ever
imagined in my dreams..

42:25.656 --> 42:28.591
"O baby just do all that."

42:28.659 --> 42:31.253
"You're..my love."

42:31.329 --> 42:33.797
"You're my intoxication of nights."

42:33.865 --> 42:36.527
"You're..my love."

42:36.634 --> 42:39.228
"Arouse my sleeping body."

42:39.303 --> 42:41.863
"You're..my love."

42:41.939 --> 42:44.533
"You're my intoxication of nights."

42:44.642 --> 42:47.110
"You're..my love."

42:47.211 --> 42:49.805
"Arouse my sleeping body."

43:00.758 --> 43:02.692
That's reason that
l can not love no other.

43:02.760 --> 43:03.351
"My love."

43:03.461 --> 43:05.361
This life l'm gonna
live it longer.

43:05.463 --> 43:05.929
"My love."

43:06.030 --> 43:08.055
l made a spell girl,
l'm down under.

43:08.132 --> 43:08.621
"My love."

43:08.699 --> 43:11.224
l keep coming back
for more and more and more.

43:11.335 --> 43:13.235
That's reason that
l can not love no other.

43:13.304 --> 43:13.963
"My love."

43:14.071 --> 43:15.936
This life l'm gonna
live it longer.

43:16.073 --> 43:16.630
"My love."

43:16.707 --> 43:18.572
l made a spell girl,
l'm down under.

43:18.676 --> 43:19.233
"My love."

43:19.310 --> 43:21.540
l keep coming back
for more and more and more.

43:23.648 --> 43:29.109
Your crazy eyess touched
me in this dark night.

43:29.186 --> 43:34.089
Something happened
to me and my breath.

43:34.191 --> 43:39.458
Your crazy eyess touched
me in this dark night.

43:39.563 --> 43:44.865
Something sizzled
down my lazy breath.

43:45.503 --> 43:48.131
"You're..my love."

43:48.205 --> 43:50.696
"You're my intoxication of nights."

43:50.775 --> 43:53.471
"You're..my love."

43:53.544 --> 43:55.671
"Arouse my sleeping body."

43:56.113 --> 43:58.741
"You're..my love."

43:58.816 --> 44:00.716
"You're my intoxication of nights."

44:01.385 --> 44:04.013
"You're..my love."

44:04.121 --> 44:06.316
"Arouse my sleeping body."

44:29.747 --> 44:32.181
"This winterfeels so hot."

44:32.416 --> 44:35.010
"There's no shame anywhere."

44:35.086 --> 44:40.251
Sweetheart..we've made
a legitimate mistake.

44:40.358 --> 44:42.883
"This winterfeels so hot."

44:43.027 --> 44:45.552
"There's no shame anywhere."

44:45.629 --> 44:50.498
Sweetheart..we've made
a legitimate mistake.

44:51.469 --> 44:54.495
"Let me make things hot for you."

44:54.672 --> 44:57.106
"Bring my lips close to yours."

44:57.475 --> 45:00.808
Everything l ever
imagined in my dreams..

45:00.878 --> 45:02.072
"just do all that."

45:02.246 --> 45:04.840
"You're..my love."

45:04.915 --> 45:07.076
"You're my intoxication of nights."

45:07.485 --> 45:10.113
"You're..my love."

45:10.221 --> 45:12.416
"Arouse my sleeping body."

45:12.857 --> 45:15.417
"You're..my love."

45:15.493 --> 45:17.927
"You're my intoxication of nights."

45:18.129 --> 45:20.689
"You're..my love."

45:20.798 --> 45:23.323
"Arouse my sleeping body."

45:26.070 --> 45:28.595
"You're my intoxication of nights."

45:31.342 --> 45:33.503
"Arouse my sleeping body."

46:32.903 --> 46:33.892
Hello. - Hello.

46:34.105 --> 46:35.037
Yeah, Kaaya, tell me.

46:35.139 --> 46:36.606
Aditya's having his breakfast.

46:36.807 --> 46:39.002
Okay, put me on speaker.
l don't have time. Quick.

46:42.346 --> 46:43.210
Yeah, Kaaya. Go ahead.

46:43.414 --> 46:45.541
Aditya, the information
l gave Saurav..

46:45.649 --> 46:48.049
..won't harm us in any way. - Good.

46:48.285 --> 46:50.617
But..l found out
something very important.

46:50.821 --> 46:51.685
What's that?

46:52.022 --> 46:53.853
Do you know some
girl called Sangeeta..

46:53.924 --> 46:55.755
..who studied with you in college?

46:56.894 --> 46:58.054
Yes, l remember.

46:58.496 --> 46:59.520
There was a girl. Yes.

46:59.864 --> 47:02.264
And you two loved each other.

47:02.700 --> 47:03.257
What nonsense.

47:03.334 --> 47:05.063
She loved me, but not me.

47:05.236 --> 47:06.168
She was a mad girl, you know.

47:06.370 --> 47:07.064
Obsessive.

47:07.371 --> 47:08.565
She committed suicide.

47:08.873 --> 47:10.238
She gave up her life for you.

47:11.642 --> 47:12.472
What?

47:13.244 --> 47:14.768
l don't know anything about this.

47:15.746 --> 47:18.237
Yes. And Saurav Singhania
is Sangita's sister.

47:18.349 --> 47:19.748
What? - Yes.

47:19.884 --> 47:21.249
And he wants to ruin you..

47:21.318 --> 47:23.377
..in orderto avenge
his sister's death.

47:24.522 --> 47:26.387
Now it all makes sense to me.

47:27.391 --> 47:29.052
Don't forget to
clone Saurav's phone.

47:29.326 --> 47:31.191
And keep informing me. - Okay.

47:35.499 --> 47:36.659
You were right, Siya.

47:37.501 --> 47:38.900
This a revenge-story.

47:40.171 --> 47:41.661
He's not just a rich vulgar rascal.

47:41.739 --> 47:43.604
But a rich vulgar cunning rascal.

47:43.908 --> 47:46.468
But Aditya if all this
is just a misunderstanding..

47:46.577 --> 47:47.908
..then why don't you
two just clear it out?

47:47.978 --> 47:49.809
But that won't make
a different, Siya.

47:50.881 --> 47:51.939
lf we want to stop Saurav..

47:52.016 --> 47:54.484
..then we'll have to
play this game his way.

47:55.419 --> 47:56.386
What?

47:56.687 --> 47:58.951
Pacificy..Bribe..Punish..discrimate.

48:03.794 --> 48:05.125
Vaswani. - Yes, sir.

48:05.529 --> 48:06.689
There was a girl called Sangita..

48:06.764 --> 48:08.322
..that studied in my
college with me. - Yes.

48:08.632 --> 48:10.827
l want her brother's
entire life history.

48:11.168 --> 48:11.998
Okay, sir.

48:15.206 --> 48:17.140
lf he knows everything about us..

48:18.175 --> 48:20.405
..then we must know
everything about him too.

49:26.577 --> 49:30.013
- Do you have to go?
- l don't want to either.

49:30.814 --> 49:32.406
But l haven't mom
for a long time now.

49:32.583 --> 49:34.016
She's missing me.

49:36.120 --> 49:37.485
l've lost my heart to you.

49:38.522 --> 49:40.387
l can't bear you going away.

49:42.293 --> 49:44.261
Promise me you'll come back soon.

49:46.130 --> 49:47.256
Promise me.

49:47.665 --> 49:48.689
Promise!

49:51.702 --> 49:55.194
lt's time for my
flight and your meeting.

49:56.307 --> 49:57.069
Shall we?

50:08.686 --> 50:11.246
Saurav's has entrapped Kaaya.

50:12.222 --> 50:14.417
We're getting the
information we want.

50:15.125 --> 50:16.285
The plan is working.

50:36.613 --> 50:37.409
l got the phone.

50:37.614 --> 50:38.842
Now listen to me very carefully.

50:39.717 --> 50:43.084
First take the sim-card
out of Saurav's phone.

50:44.321 --> 50:45.253
Done.

50:46.990 --> 50:49.652
Next..attach the sim-card
to the sim-reader..

50:49.727 --> 50:52.252
..just like we attach
the sim-carto the mobile.

50:52.629 --> 50:53.425
Done.

50:56.033 --> 50:58.797
Now attach the sim-reader
to the adapter.

50:59.069 --> 51:01.299
And attach the
adapterto your phone.

51:01.672 --> 51:02.604
As soon as you do that..

51:02.673 --> 51:04.607
..you'll see a pop-up
window on your phone.

51:04.742 --> 51:06.733
lt's giving me an option,
'Yes or No'.

51:06.844 --> 51:11.338
Press 'Yes'..and wait 10 seconds
forthe process to complete.

51:11.515 --> 51:14.746
As soon as the process completes,
press Ok.

51:17.354 --> 51:18.651
l hope she does it.

51:20.958 --> 51:22.016
Come on!

51:45.349 --> 51:46.748
Yes, Mr. Singhania..how
can l be at service?

51:46.950 --> 51:47.974
Bloody fool..

51:48.085 --> 51:48.847
l've told you a thousand times..

51:48.919 --> 51:51.149
..wheneverwe speak on phone,
we won't take each other's name.

51:51.288 --> 51:51.754
Sorry, sir.

51:51.855 --> 51:53.083
Now listen to me carefully.

51:53.290 --> 51:55.053
According to your source..

51:55.259 --> 51:58.353
..Aditya's company has
invested a lot of money in the..

51:58.529 --> 52:01.327
..Telecommunication's Bill which will
soon be passed by the Parliament.

52:01.398 --> 52:04.595
And if this is Okayed, then Aditya's
company will make a fortune.

52:04.735 --> 52:05.133
Right?

52:05.202 --> 52:06.169
Yes, the information is right.

52:06.270 --> 52:08.135
And if the Bill is rejected, then..

52:08.205 --> 52:10.264
..his company will
incur huge losses..

52:10.407 --> 52:12.102
- ..and will have to be shut down.
- Of course.

52:12.176 --> 52:12.870
Exactly.

52:12.943 --> 52:15.173
So..this Bill should get rejected.

52:15.279 --> 52:16.803
But sir..what will
you gain from all this?

52:16.914 --> 52:19.007
You can say that..

52:19.483 --> 52:22.213
..l stand to gain
from Aditya's losses.

52:22.386 --> 52:23.216
l get it, sir.

52:23.620 --> 52:26.316
Don't worry,
this Bill will never get through.

52:26.523 --> 52:28.616
How does he know all this?

52:30.227 --> 52:32.218
Everyone's got money to bribe.

52:35.399 --> 52:36.832
What no, Aditya?

52:43.340 --> 52:44.398
Aditya Diwan speaking!

52:44.508 --> 52:47.170
Mr. Aditya, don't embarrass me..

52:47.244 --> 52:48.734
..by saying your name.

52:48.946 --> 52:51.244
- Do you remember your promise?
- Of course l do.

52:51.582 --> 52:52.708
Don't worry.

52:52.983 --> 52:55.508
l've the biggest number of MPs.

52:55.953 --> 52:57.921
The Bill will be approved
by tomorrow morning.

52:58.121 --> 53:01.716
That's fine, buy out 10 more MPs.

53:02.993 --> 53:06.019
There's no need forthat.

53:06.263 --> 53:08.663
l know..but l still don't
want to take a chance.

53:09.199 --> 53:10.325
l'm sending over more money.

53:10.534 --> 53:12.627
Fine, as you wish.

53:15.138 --> 53:17.732
Let's see what Saurav
Singhania does now?

53:29.019 --> 53:29.815
Hello.

53:30.554 --> 53:31.418
Kaaya.

53:32.189 --> 53:33.747
We need to deliver 50 million..

53:33.824 --> 53:35.689
..to Telecommunication's
Minister Dutta's home.

53:36.293 --> 53:38.193
Give this job to
someone trustworthy.

53:38.595 --> 53:39.425
Don't worry.

53:46.336 --> 53:48.201
l've confirmed from my sources.

53:50.107 --> 53:53.042
That Bill will never get approval.

53:57.014 --> 53:58.606
And as forthe plan ahead..

54:00.250 --> 54:01.410
..it's already begun.

54:19.770 --> 54:22.603
You know what to
do..just be careful.

54:22.940 --> 54:25.431
Don't worry,
ma'am..l've done this before.

54:25.576 --> 54:28.010
And yes, switch off
your phone for safety sake.

54:28.178 --> 54:29.202
So that no one can track you.

54:29.446 --> 54:30.572
Yes, madam. - Leave.

54:41.291 --> 54:44.454
- Sir, we've made a big mistake.
- What's wrong?

54:44.928 --> 54:47.158
Saurav Singhania is
not Sangita's brother.

54:48.298 --> 54:49.526
What? - Yes, sir.

54:49.833 --> 54:52.700
Her brother passed away
5 years ago in some car accident.

54:53.437 --> 54:55.735
That man used this
story to entrap Kaaya.

54:56.139 --> 54:57.299
And we were celebrating that..

54:57.374 --> 54:59.467
..we'll get all the
information through Kaaya.

55:00.777 --> 55:04.873
This means he already
knew that we sent Kaaya.

55:05.349 --> 55:06.111
Yes.

55:06.883 --> 55:07.907
Oh my, God!

55:08.652 --> 55:09.880
Vaswani, we must stop the money..

55:09.953 --> 55:11.545
..we sent to Dutta at any cost!

55:11.722 --> 55:12.484
Yes, sir.

55:18.929 --> 55:21.363
Hello. - l was about to call you.

55:21.465 --> 55:22.295
The money's on the way.

55:22.366 --> 55:25.563
Stop it at all cost. - What?

55:25.802 --> 55:28.202
Aditya, the truck
left 15 minutes ago.

55:28.505 --> 55:29.529
And his phone's switched off too.

55:29.606 --> 55:31.870
Stop him at all cost. lt's a trap!

55:31.942 --> 55:33.569
Trap? What trap?

55:33.710 --> 55:35.541
Kaaya, this is not the
time to explain everything.

55:35.712 --> 55:37.270
Just chase the bloody
money and stop it!

55:44.921 --> 55:45.615
Dutta sir..

55:46.757 --> 55:48.782
Dutta sir is speaking
to the PM on the other line.

55:48.892 --> 55:49.881
Please call later.

55:49.960 --> 55:52.690
l must speak to
Dutta sir immediately.

55:52.796 --> 55:54.559
Tell him it's Aditya Diwan calling.

55:54.631 --> 55:57.031
Sir, no one's more important
than the Prime Minister.

55:57.200 --> 55:59.498
l'll call you when he's free.

56:00.237 --> 56:00.999
Hello..

56:02.439 --> 56:03.428
Bloody idiot!

56:30.200 --> 56:31.724
Pick up the goddamn phone.

56:31.835 --> 56:33.325
Pick up the phone.

56:36.406 --> 56:39.273
These businessmen only
care about themselves.

56:41.712 --> 56:42.303
Hello, sir.

56:42.479 --> 56:44.242
The Minister's still busy.

56:44.681 --> 56:46.012
l'll ask him to call you.

56:46.083 --> 56:47.744
Bloody idiot..l
told you it's urgent.

56:47.918 --> 56:49.510
Give the phone to
Dutta sir immediately.

56:49.653 --> 56:51.450
l need to speak to him right now.

56:51.722 --> 56:53.656
Hello! Hello!

57:16.079 --> 57:16.977
Where are you going?

57:17.080 --> 57:18.741
Tell Dutta sirthat
his package has arrived.

57:19.449 --> 57:22.247
- Watchman, let him through.
- Fine, go.

57:26.890 --> 57:27.914
Come on.

57:28.091 --> 57:29.115
Straight.

57:39.002 --> 57:40.094
Get down. - Why, sir.

57:40.170 --> 57:41.000
Get down.

57:41.171 --> 57:43.571
- lt's only mango crates.
- Mango crates.

57:43.673 --> 57:45.163
Show me. - Come, sir.

57:45.475 --> 57:46.965
Let me show you. - What's inside?

57:47.277 --> 57:50.007
Open these crates. Come on.

57:50.380 --> 57:51.972
Sir.. - Where?

57:52.315 --> 57:55.341
l don't know whose it is.

57:55.952 --> 57:58.284
As Telecommunication
Minister Dutta..

57:58.355 --> 58:01.085
..was arrested
red-handed taking bribe..

58:01.158 --> 58:03.626
..the Home Minister,
Delhi has withdrawn..

58:03.727 --> 58:07.094
..his proposed Telecommunication
Bill from the parliament..

58:07.297 --> 58:08.730
And he has also said..

58:08.799 --> 58:11.199
..that he's appointing a
Fast-Track enquiry commission..

58:11.301 --> 58:14.134
..regarding Dutta's bribe case.

58:14.371 --> 58:15.736
According to our sources..

58:15.806 --> 58:17.433
..the Delhi Home Ministry
has stated that..

58:17.541 --> 58:20.203
..until the enquiry commission
doesn't submit it's report..

58:20.310 --> 58:22.744
..the telecommunication
bill won't be..

58:23.146 --> 58:23.976
No!

58:25.348 --> 58:27.111
Aditya, listen to me. - Rascal!

58:27.184 --> 58:28.913
Calm down, Aditya, listen to me.

58:28.985 --> 58:32.113
The bloody Saurav..l
will destroy him!

58:34.925 --> 58:36.654
Well..here l am, Mr. Diwan.

58:41.431 --> 58:42.989
Now destroy me.

58:43.133 --> 58:44.122
Who the hell are you?

58:46.236 --> 58:47.328
Why are you doing this?

58:48.071 --> 58:50.335
So you know that
my name isn't Saurav.

58:50.574 --> 58:53.134
So let's say l am..Gaurav.

58:54.244 --> 58:56.371
How's that? - l am not a fool.

58:57.347 --> 58:59.815
l don't know why
you're doing all this.

59:00.851 --> 59:04.753
But l know you're
trying to ruin me..

59:04.888 --> 59:06.412
..and l won't let that happen.

59:07.357 --> 59:09.291
Listen to that.

59:10.093 --> 59:12.152
So you haven't
understood anything yet.

59:13.063 --> 59:16.055
Siya, please explain your husband.

59:16.566 --> 59:18.193
l mean there's no point
in ruining your entire life..

59:18.268 --> 59:19.599
..for just one demand.

59:20.003 --> 59:21.095
You rascal. - Aditya.

59:21.805 --> 59:23.432
Aditya, let go.

59:23.573 --> 59:25.564
l only believe in
love and not violence.

59:25.642 --> 59:27.234
You got the wrong guy.

59:27.611 --> 59:32.310
Whoever you are,
l will find out the truth..

59:32.515 --> 59:35.416
..even if l've to
risk my life for it.

59:35.785 --> 59:38.276
l'll find out who you
are and l'll destroy you.

59:39.055 --> 59:40.317
l will finish you.

59:42.592 --> 59:44.116
You're a strange man.

59:44.394 --> 59:47.022
So..you'd rather give your life
and not your consent to this union.

59:51.735 --> 59:53.794
Now this is going to be fun.

59:54.304 --> 59:56.101
You don't want to give up..

59:56.907 --> 59:58.898
..and l never learned to quit.

59:59.709 --> 01:00:03.270
So we must wait
and watch..who wins.

01:00:04.014 --> 01:00:06.278
Because both of us can't win.

01:00:11.087 --> 01:00:12.679
And l am loving this.

01:00:25.335 --> 01:00:27.701
Please! Please! Please! Please!

01:00:27.804 --> 01:00:29.601
Please calm down everyone!

01:00:29.773 --> 01:00:31.297
The Minister's on his way.

01:00:31.574 --> 01:00:33.838
He'll present his side
of story..in detail.

01:00:34.044 --> 01:00:36.205
Afterthat if anyone
has any questions..

01:00:36.313 --> 01:00:37.371
..then he can ask them.

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.547
Please be patient.

01:00:42.018 --> 01:00:42.575
Move please.

01:00:42.652 --> 01:00:44.711
Stay back. Back.
Move aside.

01:00:48.591 --> 01:00:51.355
l would like to
clearly state that..

01:00:51.962 --> 01:00:53.827
..the truck carrying cash..

01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:56.558
..seized by the
CBl outside my home..

01:00:56.833 --> 01:00:59.597
..is that l've no
connection to that sum.

01:00:59.669 --> 01:01:01.398
Nor do l know anything about it.

01:01:01.471 --> 01:01:04.235
Why? Who?
And what this money was sent for?

01:01:04.341 --> 01:01:07.071
Mr. Minister, the truck
was seized outside your home.

01:01:07.243 --> 01:01:08.232
So it was meant for you, right?

01:01:08.345 --> 01:01:10.745
lf there's a buffalo
standing outside your home..

01:01:10.947 --> 01:01:12.471
..will that make the buffalo yours?

01:01:14.084 --> 01:01:15.142
According to our sources..

01:01:15.218 --> 01:01:17.186
..this money was
sent to buy out few MPs.

01:01:17.253 --> 01:01:17.947
ls it true?

01:01:18.021 --> 01:01:20.353
Please think before
you ask question.

01:01:20.423 --> 01:01:21.822
Everyone knows..

01:01:22.025 --> 01:01:24.823
Our party has a majority
in the Parliament.

01:01:24.961 --> 01:01:27.555
So why would we buy
out MPs from other parties?

01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:28.688
Well then,
who does the money belong to?

01:01:28.798 --> 01:01:30.493
The Police are carrying
out an investigation.

01:01:30.667 --> 01:01:33.431
But according to my
experience in Politics..

01:01:33.703 --> 01:01:37.400
..l can definitely say
that some lndustrialist friend..

01:01:37.474 --> 01:01:40.102
..of the opposite party
is trying to instigate me.

01:01:40.276 --> 01:01:41.504
Pardon me.

01:01:41.611 --> 01:01:42.703
Thank you.

01:01:44.247 --> 01:01:46.875
Sir, by telling the media that..

01:01:46.983 --> 01:01:49.076
..this can be the job
of some industrialist..

01:01:49.619 --> 01:01:54.852
..Dutta has tied
the noose around you.

01:01:58.028 --> 01:01:59.859
And now he can stoop to any level..

01:01:59.929 --> 01:02:01.658
..in orderto save
his honor and post.

01:02:03.333 --> 01:02:04.595
Sir..could it be possible that..

01:02:05.001 --> 01:02:06.525
..Saurav has joined
hands with the Minister.

01:02:06.803 --> 01:02:07.929
Kill that Saurav.

01:02:08.071 --> 01:02:09.265
Finish him, l don't care.

01:02:09.339 --> 01:02:10.533
Just kill that rascal.

01:02:15.712 --> 01:02:16.610
Aditya.

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:22.348
ln orderto get out
of this situation..

01:02:22.619 --> 01:02:26.680
..before we kill Saurav,
we must find out..

01:02:26.756 --> 01:02:30.055
..how he knew that we sent Kaaya.

01:02:31.928 --> 01:02:32.826
Where's Kaaya?

01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:34.892
l don't know, sir.

01:02:35.432 --> 01:02:38.094
l've been trying to call her,
but her phone's switched off.

01:02:39.035 --> 01:02:40.764
l don't know where she is.

01:02:55.652 --> 01:02:59.645
"How did..this happen?"

01:02:59.856 --> 01:03:03.917
"How did..this happen?"

01:03:03.993 --> 01:03:08.054
"How did..this happen?"

01:03:08.131 --> 01:03:12.295
"How did..this happen?"

01:03:20.977 --> 01:03:25.073
Whenever l think of
you..it only makes me cry.

01:03:25.148 --> 01:03:26.979
"O tormentor you should know.."

01:03:27.083 --> 01:03:29.313
"l love to hate you baby."

01:03:29.385 --> 01:03:33.515
Whenever l think of
you..it only makes me cry.

01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:35.387
"O tormentor you should know.."

01:03:35.492 --> 01:03:37.426
"l love to hate you baby."

01:03:43.566 --> 01:03:45.557
"l love to hate you baby."

01:03:51.975 --> 01:03:53.966
"l love to hate you baby."

01:04:04.554 --> 01:04:06.454
"Why did you.."

01:04:06.656 --> 01:04:08.647
"Why did you listen to your mom?"

01:04:08.758 --> 01:04:12.751
When she used to say that
my heaven's at yourfeet.

01:04:12.862 --> 01:04:14.921
"Why did you.."

01:04:14.998 --> 01:04:17.023
"Why did you listen to your mom?"

01:04:17.133 --> 01:04:21.433
When she used to say that
my heaven's at yourfeet.

01:04:21.771 --> 01:04:23.796
"Why did l stay quiet?"

01:04:23.873 --> 01:04:25.932
"Why didn't l scream l say?"

01:04:26.009 --> 01:04:27.772
"Every time you tormented me."

01:04:27.844 --> 01:04:29.778
"l love to hate you baby."

01:04:35.952 --> 01:04:37.977
"l love to hate you baby."

01:04:44.294 --> 01:04:46.285
"l love to hate you baby."

01:05:14.624 --> 01:05:16.615
Kaaya! Kaaya!

01:05:19.028 --> 01:05:20.518
You're a cheat.

01:05:21.264 --> 01:05:23.425
l love you and you
stab me in the back.

01:05:24.434 --> 01:05:26.402
And you take the
knife and stab me back.

01:05:35.278 --> 01:05:36.074
l missed you.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:47.212
Look..l was only following
Aditya's instructions.

01:05:48.024 --> 01:05:49.616
You win and l lose.

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:51.352
Please let me go.

01:05:53.529 --> 01:05:56.862
Don't worry..l am not Aditya.

01:05:57.166 --> 01:05:59.566
l won't show you dreams
of heaven..and throw you in hell.

01:06:00.503 --> 01:06:01.902
But the choice is yours.

01:06:02.772 --> 01:06:07.835
lf you want..you
can be with me..again.

01:06:08.077 --> 01:06:09.101
Close to me.

01:06:10.713 --> 01:06:13.079
l haven't forgotten
our nights together.

01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:16.778
Or you can stay in
jail..with convicts like you.

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.953
And they too l'm
sure will give you..

01:06:19.055 --> 01:06:21.580
..many-many nights
that you'll neverforget.

01:06:25.762 --> 01:06:26.729
Almost forgot..

01:06:26.796 --> 01:06:28.058
l want you to hear something.

01:06:36.139 --> 01:06:37.003
Hello.

01:06:37.507 --> 01:06:38.303
Kaaya.

01:06:39.208 --> 01:06:40.698
We need to deliver 5 million..

01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:42.903
..to Telecommunication's
Minister Dutta's home.

01:06:43.246 --> 01:06:45.407
Give this job to
someone trustworthy.

01:06:45.915 --> 01:06:46.939
Don't worry.

01:06:49.085 --> 01:06:52.919
You thought only you can
tape phones and record calls.

01:06:53.423 --> 01:06:54.651
What's the first rule of enmity?

01:06:54.724 --> 01:06:57.693
Never, ever,
ever underestimate your enemy.

01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:01.261
Never underestimate your enemy.

01:07:01.631 --> 01:07:03.121
And this dialogue's
repeated in every movie.

01:07:03.232 --> 01:07:05.291
Really..shame on you.

01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:11.165
l could've released
this recording to the media.

01:07:12.241 --> 01:07:13.708
Or handed it overto the police.

01:07:14.377 --> 01:07:16.572
But l know you're
just a pawn in this game.

01:07:18.247 --> 01:07:19.578
And so l want to
give you a chance..

01:07:19.682 --> 01:07:20.671
..to save yourself from all this.

01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:21.512
What say?

01:07:22.785 --> 01:07:23.945
Do you want to clear out of this?

01:07:24.087 --> 01:07:25.179
What do you want?

01:07:35.365 --> 01:07:36.161
Kaaya.

01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:38.664
Hello Kaaya, where have you been?

01:07:38.735 --> 01:07:40.896
Aditya, l am tired.

01:07:41.704 --> 01:07:43.262
First the Soft drink factory case..

01:07:43.339 --> 01:07:44.931
..and now the Communication's Bill.

01:07:46.175 --> 01:07:49.702
How long are you going
to use me for your profit?

01:07:51.013 --> 01:07:52.207
l want out.

01:07:53.816 --> 01:07:55.215
Please protect me.

01:07:55.551 --> 01:07:58.679
l am tired, Aditya. l am tired.

01:07:59.789 --> 01:08:01.347
Come back to Mumbai, Kaaya..

01:08:01.424 --> 01:08:02.413
..and we'll work something out.

01:08:02.525 --> 01:08:05.323
No! No more deals!

01:08:05.728 --> 01:08:07.525
l just want a letter of assurance..

01:08:07.997 --> 01:08:11.694
..stating that l've nothing
to with these incidents.

01:08:11.768 --> 01:08:12.359
That's it.

01:08:12.435 --> 01:08:13.595
Don't you trust me, Kaaya?

01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:15.533
No..l don't trust anyone!

01:08:16.104 --> 01:08:19.563
lf you don't help me
and give me that letter..

01:08:19.642 --> 01:08:23.544
..then l'll tell the press that
you tried to bribe the Minister.

01:08:24.546 --> 01:08:25.741
lt's simple, Aditya.

01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:29.375
lf l go down..l'll
take you with me.

01:08:30.019 --> 01:08:30.986
Damn it!

01:08:42.799 --> 01:08:44.698
And the award goes to Kaaya!

01:08:45.268 --> 01:08:49.398
Kaaya you're so beautiful,
so talented, so dangerous..

01:08:49.505 --> 01:08:52.064
You should've been an actor! Really.

01:08:54.343 --> 01:08:57.335
Okay, enough..l am sorry.

01:08:59.115 --> 01:09:01.709
Please stop crying. Please.

01:09:04.353 --> 01:09:05.377
Please stop.

01:09:06.154 --> 01:09:09.215
l told you..l am with you.

01:09:11.027 --> 01:09:11.959
Enough..

01:09:13.328 --> 01:09:14.728
..you're my responsibility now.

01:09:15.997 --> 01:09:16.725
That's it.

01:09:19.368 --> 01:09:21.393
We're one team, right? - Yeah!

01:09:24.006 --> 01:09:24.904
We're one team.

01:09:51.067 --> 01:09:53.261
Do come in my dreams and tell me..

01:09:53.636 --> 01:09:55.604
..if there's life after death.

01:09:58.608 --> 01:09:59.575
Okay!

01:10:04.814 --> 01:10:06.042
Take care of this.

01:10:19.629 --> 01:10:20.789
Kaaya is dead!

01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:28.294
Aditya..

01:10:30.039 --> 01:10:31.597
..this wasn't Kaaya.

01:10:33.209 --> 01:10:34.471
What do you mean?

01:10:35.378 --> 01:10:37.812
l mean it was Kaaya speaking..

01:10:38.281 --> 01:10:40.215
..but the words were not hers.

01:10:40.983 --> 01:10:43.611
l am a woman..l can sense it.

01:10:45.588 --> 01:10:47.112
You mean Saurav Singhania.

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:51.926
Yes. l think he's trying
to use her against us.

01:10:52.061 --> 01:10:53.858
Siya is absolutely right, sir.

01:10:55.131 --> 01:10:57.599
He's trying to instigate
you in some big conspiracy.

01:10:59.468 --> 01:11:00.662
Take my advice, sir.

01:11:00.903 --> 01:11:05.237
You and Siya must
leave lndia forfew days.

01:11:05.308 --> 01:11:06.900
Vaswani, what are you trying..

01:11:07.009 --> 01:11:10.911
Sir, l am well-versed with
the law and administration here.

01:11:11.013 --> 01:11:12.241
Please..take my advice..

01:11:12.348 --> 01:11:14.316
..and leave for US tonight.

01:11:14.650 --> 01:11:15.810
l'll make all the arrangements.

01:11:15.885 --> 01:11:17.147
l am not a bloody coward.

01:11:17.353 --> 01:11:18.251
l am not going anywhere.

01:11:18.321 --> 01:11:18.719
Sir..

01:11:18.821 --> 01:11:22.086
Aditya! Vaswani is right.

01:11:22.258 --> 01:11:24.249
We need to retreat to think clearly.

01:11:52.588 --> 01:11:53.384
Let's go.

01:12:40.569 --> 01:12:41.729
Hello.

01:12:42.471 --> 01:12:43.631
The job's done.

01:12:49.345 --> 01:12:51.973
Come on, have some. - Of course.

01:12:52.314 --> 01:12:54.748
Yes, Mr. Singhania.

01:12:55.317 --> 01:12:57.148
l told you..l am the only man..

01:12:57.253 --> 01:12:59.380
..that can get you
out of this puddle.

01:13:00.156 --> 01:13:01.953
You don't need to worry now.

01:13:02.058 --> 01:13:04.925
Mr. Singhania,
l never doubted you for a second.

01:13:05.394 --> 01:13:09.763
So l expect that you'll
keep your promise as well.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.495
Of course, Mr. Singhania.

01:13:12.735 --> 01:13:13.565
Of course.

01:13:32.354 --> 01:13:35.152
l am sorry, Mr.
Diwan. You're under arrest.

01:13:35.624 --> 01:13:37.023
How dare you touch me?

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:41.018
l am no petty thief
whom you can touch.

01:13:41.964 --> 01:13:45.559
My name's Aditya Diwan.
Do you know who l am?

01:13:46.168 --> 01:13:47.032
l do.

01:13:47.503 --> 01:13:49.164
And l also know that..

01:13:49.238 --> 01:13:52.298
..you've been charged with
the murder of Ms. Kaaya Sharma.

01:13:54.577 --> 01:13:55.339
What?

01:13:58.647 --> 01:14:01.047
On the day of the first hearing..

01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:03.343
..we've received
information that..

01:14:03.419 --> 01:14:05.216
..the police has retrieved
Kaaya Sharma's body..

01:14:05.321 --> 01:14:07.221
..few miles outside Mumbai,
at a lonesome road.

01:14:07.323 --> 01:14:08.585
Murder mixed with Politics.

01:14:08.657 --> 01:14:11.387
Well yes, this happens to be
one of the biggest cases this year.

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:12.984
And as you can see
right behind me..

01:14:13.062 --> 01:14:14.723
..we're outside this
court bringing to you..

01:14:14.797 --> 01:14:15.764
..every single update.

01:14:15.831 --> 01:14:19.665
This case looks quite interesting
even before it started.

01:14:31.113 --> 01:14:34.913
Stay back. Stay back everyone.

01:14:35.117 --> 01:14:39.019
Sir. What's your connection
to Kaaya Sharma's murder?

01:14:39.622 --> 01:14:41.522
Sir..we want to know.

01:14:42.024 --> 01:14:43.013
Please answer us.

01:14:43.125 --> 01:14:43.921
Sir, please.

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.718
Sir, please.
Please answer us.

01:14:45.961 --> 01:14:47.360
Sir, please.

01:14:48.597 --> 01:14:49.996
Please be seated.

01:14:54.837 --> 01:14:57.305
Mr. Public Prosecutor,
you may proceed.

01:14:57.373 --> 01:15:02.106
Your Honor,
right from pesticide being found..

01:15:02.511 --> 01:15:04.775
..in Mr. Aditya Diwan's
soft drink factory..

01:15:04.947 --> 01:15:07.541
..to the Telecommunication Bill..

01:15:08.417 --> 01:15:14.788
..Mr. Aditya Diwan cunningly
used Ms. Kaaya Sharma.

01:15:15.457 --> 01:15:17.220
When Mr. Diwan felt that..

01:15:17.526 --> 01:15:22.657
..she's becoming a threat
for him or his business..

01:15:22.932 --> 01:15:25.958
..then Mr. Diwan got rid of her.

01:15:30.272 --> 01:15:31.330
Your Honor..

01:15:32.875 --> 01:15:34.365
..this is not a case..

01:15:35.411 --> 01:15:38.539
..it's just a bail
application hearing.

01:15:39.582 --> 01:15:43.382
Whether my client, Mr.
Aditya Diwan is guilty or not..

01:15:43.652 --> 01:15:46.416
..we'll find that out later.

01:15:46.488 --> 01:15:48.854
Mr. Prosecutor,
can you prove here..

01:15:48.991 --> 01:15:52.154
..that Mr. Diwan is involved
in this murder..

01:15:52.294 --> 01:15:54.285
..and he needs to be questioned.

01:15:54.563 --> 01:15:59.159
Your Honor, l've evidence
to prove all the facts.

01:16:06.442 --> 01:16:10.401
My Lord, this is the recording
of two telephonic conversations..

01:16:10.813 --> 01:16:13.907
..that happened between
Mr. Aditya and Ms. Kaaya.

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:15.683
Along with the Lab's certificate..

01:16:15.885 --> 01:16:19.514
..that proves that these are
Mr. Aditya Diwan..

01:16:19.622 --> 01:16:21.283
..and Ms. Kaaya Sharma's voices.

01:16:47.449 --> 01:16:48.711
Hello. - Kaaya.

01:16:49.551 --> 01:16:50.848
"We need to deliver 5 million.."

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.820
..to Telecommunication's
Minister Dutta's home.

01:16:53.656 --> 01:16:55.317
Give this job to
someone trustworthy.

01:16:55.758 --> 01:16:56.554
"Don't worry."

01:17:01.330 --> 01:17:02.729
Order! Order!

01:17:03.299 --> 01:17:04.288
Silence please.

01:17:05.067 --> 01:17:08.127
Your Honor,
this is the second recording..

01:17:08.504 --> 01:17:13.567
..which proves that
Ms. Kaaya was tired of all this..

01:17:13.676 --> 01:17:16.770
..and wanted to stay
away from everything.

01:17:19.748 --> 01:17:21.079
"Hello Kaaya, where have you been?"

01:17:22.084 --> 01:17:24.052
"Aditya, l am tired."

01:17:24.687 --> 01:17:26.120
First the Soft
drink factory case..

01:17:26.188 --> 01:17:27.712
..and now the
Communication's Bill.

01:17:27.856 --> 01:17:30.916
How long are you going
to use me for your profit?

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.184
"l want out."

01:17:32.661 --> 01:17:34.128
"Please protect me."

01:17:34.196 --> 01:17:36.960
"l am tired, Aditya. l am tired."

01:17:45.207 --> 01:17:46.902
"Come back to Mumbai, Kaaya.."

01:17:46.976 --> 01:17:47.965
"and we'll work something out."

01:17:50.012 --> 01:17:51.707
"No..l don't trust anyone!"

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:52.940
"lt's simple, Aditya."

01:17:53.015 --> 01:17:55.506
lf l go down..l'll
take you with me.

01:17:59.521 --> 01:18:02.922
Your Honor, we're worried that Mr.
Aditya Diwan..

01:18:03.125 --> 01:18:06.561
..can tamperwith evidence
and intimidate the witnesses.

01:18:06.762 --> 01:18:09.230
So..l request the court that..

01:18:09.431 --> 01:18:12.889
..Mr. Aditya Diwan
shouldn't be granted bail..

01:18:12.968 --> 01:18:15.732
..until the police doesn't
complete their investigation.

01:18:15.838 --> 01:18:16.964
That's all, your Honor.

01:18:22.778 --> 01:18:24.643
After listening to
all the arguments..

01:18:24.913 --> 01:18:26.904
..the court orders Aditya Diwan..

01:18:27.182 --> 01:18:28.843
..to be remanded
in police custody..

01:18:29.151 --> 01:18:31.779
..until the police
conducts its investigation.

01:18:47.903 --> 01:18:48.835
Move. Step back.

01:18:48.904 --> 01:18:51.202
ls it true that you
murdered Kaaya Sharma?

01:18:51.273 --> 01:18:51.932
Move.

01:18:52.341 --> 01:18:54.536
Are there more people
involved in this?

01:18:55.044 --> 01:18:56.136
The evidence is against you.

01:18:56.245 --> 01:18:57.712
How can you run from here.

01:18:59.448 --> 01:19:01.245
How are you connected?

01:19:01.316 --> 01:19:02.078
Please tell us.

01:19:02.851 --> 01:19:05.911
Mr. Diwan, what secrets did
Kaaya know about you?

01:19:07.489 --> 01:19:08.888
Please tell us.

01:19:08.957 --> 01:19:12.085
Move. Let him go.

01:19:26.442 --> 01:19:30.503
My faith in the Law of
this country has been restored.

01:19:30.679 --> 01:19:35.878
The opposition has used
one of their industrialist friend..

01:19:35.951 --> 01:19:37.475
..in orderto humiliate me.

01:19:37.586 --> 01:19:38.985
What's his name?

01:19:39.154 --> 01:19:40.348
Aditya Diwan?

01:19:40.456 --> 01:19:42.185
Yes, Aditya Diwan.

01:19:42.324 --> 01:19:44.986
This is the first time
l even heard his name.

01:19:46.161 --> 01:19:48.493
But..l promise..

01:19:48.697 --> 01:19:50.927
l'll take strict
actions against him..

01:19:50.999 --> 01:19:54.059
..and he'll always remember my name.

01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:56.897
This politician is a rascal.

01:19:57.940 --> 01:19:59.271
We got him the seat..

01:19:59.508 --> 01:20:02.773
..and now he'll use
Mr. Aditya as a pawn..

01:20:03.946 --> 01:20:07.473
..in his politics and sacrifice
him in orderto save his post.

01:20:09.218 --> 01:20:11.743
He won't let him come out of jail.

01:20:12.921 --> 01:20:14.548
l don't know what to do.

01:20:27.636 --> 01:20:29.399
You have only five minutes.

01:20:45.954 --> 01:20:49.253
Siya..tell Vaswani
to get the best legal time.

01:20:51.927 --> 01:20:53.918
Get me out of here soon.

01:20:55.597 --> 01:20:57.861
Just get me out
of this goddamn place.

01:21:00.335 --> 01:21:03.896
l will handle that, but..

01:21:04.072 --> 01:21:05.130
But what?

01:21:06.775 --> 01:21:08.675
After you left, outside the court..

01:21:19.521 --> 01:21:22.718
You know..l can get your
husband out of jail if you want.

01:21:24.626 --> 01:21:25.786
But you see..

01:21:28.297 --> 01:21:31.528
My wishes alone don't count.

01:21:33.535 --> 01:21:34.900
You should too.

01:21:43.145 --> 01:21:44.305
Rascal!

01:21:52.154 --> 01:21:53.815
Siya, listen to me carefully.

01:21:54.256 --> 01:21:56.224
Even if l'm jailed for life..

01:21:57.059 --> 01:21:59.425
..you won't let that
Saurav intimidate you.

01:22:01.663 --> 01:22:02.960
Promise me!

01:22:04.766 --> 01:22:05.790
Just promise me!

01:22:52.314 --> 01:22:54.214
You took really long to get here.

01:23:00.122 --> 01:23:01.555
You win.

01:23:02.024 --> 01:23:03.889
l don't know why you're doing this.

01:23:04.926 --> 01:23:06.894
But tonight l..

01:23:09.364 --> 01:23:11.491
l don't know what
happiness you get..

01:23:11.566 --> 01:23:14.160
..by taking advantage
of someone's helplessness.

01:23:15.637 --> 01:23:18.470
But l want evidence
to prove Aditya innocent.

01:23:27.516 --> 01:23:29.108
My father used to tell me.

01:23:30.652 --> 01:23:32.119
No one get's rich easily.

01:23:32.988 --> 01:23:37.118
Behind every
fortune..there's a crime.

01:23:38.393 --> 01:23:41.658
You're not helpless..nor am l.

01:23:43.131 --> 01:23:45.292
l don't know what
you're talking about!

01:23:45.567 --> 01:23:46.556
That's alright.

01:23:47.102 --> 01:23:49.093
And anyway,
you didn't come here to debate.

01:23:49.705 --> 01:23:52.173
So why are we getting
into a debate, right.

01:23:52.574 --> 01:23:55.134
We should do what you're here for.

01:23:55.911 --> 01:23:56.935
So come on..

01:23:58.013 --> 01:23:59.139
..seduce me.

01:24:00.115 --> 01:24:03.084
l am not some slave whom
you paid to make you happy.

01:24:03.552 --> 01:24:05.110
l don't please for money.

01:24:06.188 --> 01:24:08.281
No one really does it for money.

01:24:11.159 --> 01:24:14.925
Even a prostitute doesn't
charge you for sex.

01:24:16.431 --> 01:24:19.730
ln fact, she charges you
for leaving your bed afterthe sex.

01:24:22.571 --> 01:24:23.799
You can leave too..

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.805
..with the evidence.

01:24:27.943 --> 01:24:31.037
You're a bloody cheap rascal!

01:24:44.326 --> 01:24:45.190
Here you go.

01:24:46.428 --> 01:24:47.520
lt'll help you.

01:24:47.996 --> 01:24:50.123
See, the way l see
it..you've only two choices.

01:24:51.833 --> 01:24:53.528
Either you be a slave..

01:24:55.137 --> 01:24:56.229
..or you be a widow.

01:25:27.602 --> 01:25:36.374
How do l say..how restless
l am in your love?

01:25:36.445 --> 01:25:44.648
l want to look in your
eyes and steal your dreams.

01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:57.261
How do l say..how restless
l am in your love?

01:25:57.833 --> 01:26:05.740
l want to look in your
eyes and steal your dreams.

01:26:06.041 --> 01:26:12.446
"That's my shadow.."

01:26:12.714 --> 01:26:21.645
..the place where
you're standing now.

01:26:21.723 --> 01:26:27.252
"l am alive.."

01:26:27.462 --> 01:26:35.494
"and the reason's you."

01:26:37.172 --> 01:26:42.667
"l am alive.."

01:26:42.978 --> 01:26:50.942
"and the reason's you."

01:27:13.275 --> 01:27:17.405
lt's an intoxication..it's
a poison.

01:27:17.612 --> 01:27:26.111
"What do we call this love?"

01:27:26.555 --> 01:27:30.787
lt's an intoxication..it's
a poison.

01:27:30.959 --> 01:27:35.293
"What do we call this love?"

01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:39.764
There's a saga that's
been incomplete for a long.

01:27:39.901 --> 01:27:43.530
"Let's complete it."

01:27:43.738 --> 01:27:49.904
"How can l forget you?"

01:27:50.345 --> 01:27:58.514
"You're my first mistake."

01:27:59.254 --> 01:28:04.749
"l am alive.."

01:28:05.026 --> 01:28:14.230
"and the reason's you."

01:28:35.290 --> 01:28:39.488
"You don't know my intentions."

01:28:39.628 --> 01:28:43.997
"l'll steal your breath."

01:28:44.165 --> 01:28:48.295
My heart's telling
me to be a criminal.

01:28:48.403 --> 01:28:52.635
"There's peace beyond these crimes."

01:28:52.707 --> 01:28:58.805
"l am the lost night.."

01:28:59.047 --> 01:29:07.614
"and you're my pleasant morning."

01:29:07.989 --> 01:29:13.325
"l am alive.."

01:29:13.728 --> 01:29:22.102
"and the reason's you."

01:29:30.545 --> 01:29:32.570
l want evidence
of Aditya's innocence.

01:29:32.747 --> 01:29:34.009
What's the hurry?

01:29:59.174 --> 01:30:00.072
"What are you thinking?"

01:30:09.150 --> 01:30:11.983
lt's been three months
since papa died.

01:30:13.655 --> 01:30:15.680
The lawyer is going
to read out his will.

01:30:17.325 --> 01:30:20.920
Just scared that papa didn't
give me any such responsibility..

01:30:21.796 --> 01:30:23.320
..that l can't handle.

01:30:23.732 --> 01:30:24.699
Don't worry..

01:30:24.933 --> 01:30:27.595
..l'm sure papa didn't
give you any responsibility..

01:30:27.702 --> 01:30:28.896
..that you can't handle.

01:30:30.071 --> 01:30:33.063
Brother..you're not dressed yet.

01:30:33.208 --> 01:30:34.300
We're getting late.

01:30:34.409 --> 01:30:35.103
10 minutes.

01:30:43.218 --> 01:30:44.412
With everyone's permission..

01:30:44.586 --> 01:30:46.952
..l would like to
start reading this will.

01:30:51.993 --> 01:30:54.826
l, Raghavendra Diwan..is
making this will..

01:30:54.929 --> 01:30:58.160
..in complete senses and
not under anyone's pressure.

01:30:59.734 --> 01:31:02.498
l believe that..if
Diwan Group of Companies..

01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:04.299
..wants to achieve
new heights of success..

01:31:04.506 --> 01:31:07.998
..then it needs experience
as well as zest.

01:31:08.309 --> 01:31:11.369
And so l consider myself fortunate..

01:31:11.579 --> 01:31:13.843
..that l've two sons
like Ram and Lakshman.

01:31:14.182 --> 01:31:16.047
Vikram and Aditya.

01:31:16.851 --> 01:31:19.183
l want my elder son Vikram Diwan..

01:31:19.454 --> 01:31:21.718
..to be the heir
to all my properties..

01:31:22.123 --> 01:31:24.353
..and the chairman
to Diwan Group of Companies.

01:31:25.126 --> 01:31:27.060
And my younger son Aditya Diwan..

01:31:27.362 --> 01:31:28.761
..will be the Vice-President.

01:31:31.866 --> 01:31:33.060
Congratulations. - Thank you.

01:31:34.335 --> 01:31:36.132
We'll do as papa wanted.

01:31:37.539 --> 01:31:38.528
l am so happy.

01:31:50.051 --> 01:31:51.848
Congratulations, Mr. Chairman.

01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:54.420
- l am so, so happy today.
- Thank you.

01:31:54.489 --> 01:31:57.322
Aditya, l am sure there's
an informer in our Board room.

01:31:57.625 --> 01:32:00.492
How else did Siya know that
l am the chairman starting today?

01:32:00.695 --> 01:32:02.356
lt must be that bloody Vaswani.

01:32:02.664 --> 01:32:04.291
Madam..its good news.
lt's him, isn't it?

01:32:04.432 --> 01:32:06.332
Aditya, you're so mean.

01:32:07.268 --> 01:32:09.236
Yes, it was Vaswani. - Okay.

01:32:09.304 --> 01:32:11.135
Now come on,
will you give me a hug or not.

01:32:11.306 --> 01:32:12.102
Yeah.

01:32:14.075 --> 01:32:16.737
And on this joyous occasion,
tonight there's a celebration.

01:32:16.845 --> 01:32:17.675
A party.

01:32:18.379 --> 01:32:20.313
Now run to the salon
and l'll pick you up at 8.

01:32:20.582 --> 01:32:21.139
Okay?

01:32:21.783 --> 01:32:22.647
See you.

01:32:26.387 --> 01:32:28.719
Vikram, you're 15 minutes early.

01:32:29.858 --> 01:32:31.325
l am still getting ready.

01:32:36.764 --> 01:32:37.696
You cheat!

01:32:38.366 --> 01:32:40.493
You were showering him with
your love today, weren't you.

01:32:40.869 --> 01:32:43.269
Since he became the chairman
and took overthe property..

01:32:43.404 --> 01:32:44.803
..you showed yourtrue colors.

01:32:44.939 --> 01:32:46.531
Now l understand yourtrue plan.

01:32:47.008 --> 01:32:48.475
First please both the brothers.

01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:51.078
And then find your happiness
with the richer one.

01:32:56.150 --> 01:32:57.344
Are you crazy?

01:32:58.953 --> 01:33:02.286
You know that l love you.

01:33:04.759 --> 01:33:09.025
And it was your decision..to
hide our love-story.

01:33:09.130 --> 01:33:11.394
We decided to fall in love..

01:33:12.033 --> 01:33:13.523
..not to make deals in love.

01:33:15.103 --> 01:33:18.300
You think l am making a deal?

01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:22.767
So? lf you really love me,
then prove it to me.

01:33:23.044 --> 01:33:25.239
Prove that you're not
in this forthe money.

01:33:25.947 --> 01:33:27.107
Tonight, afterthe party..

01:33:27.181 --> 01:33:29.172
..you'll come with me to my bedroom.

01:33:29.651 --> 01:33:31.346
And if you don't do it..

01:33:32.186 --> 01:33:34.051
..then l promise you l'll
never see yourface again.

01:33:34.822 --> 01:33:36.449
lf you're not with me..

01:33:37.458 --> 01:33:38.720
..you're against me.

01:33:53.741 --> 01:33:54.571
Hey. - Congratulations.

01:33:54.676 --> 01:33:55.301
Thank you.

01:33:56.744 --> 01:33:57.733
Hi, Aditya. - Hi.

01:33:57.912 --> 01:33:58.810
Where's Vikram?

01:33:59.147 --> 01:34:00.614
The host's late in his own party.

01:34:00.715 --> 01:34:01.511
This is not fair.

01:34:01.582 --> 01:34:02.310
Cheers.

01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:03.175
Hi. - Hi.

Hello, Aditya. Where's Vikram?

01:34:07.288 --> 01:34:08.585
He'll be here soon.

01:34:09.190 --> 01:34:11.124
No, he's already here.

01:34:12.894 --> 01:34:15.294
There he is..the man of the moment.

01:34:16.364 --> 01:34:17.331
Congratulations.

01:34:17.398 --> 01:34:18.888
Thank you so much.

01:34:18.967 --> 01:34:19.763
Hi, Siya.

Where's Aditya?

01:34:48.563 --> 01:34:49.621
Aditya.

01:34:50.231 --> 01:34:50.993
Aditya.

01:34:52.467 --> 01:34:53.229
There he is.

01:34:53.568 --> 01:34:54.466
Come here.

01:34:54.802 --> 01:34:56.429
Yeah. - My handsome younger brother.

01:35:08.649 --> 01:35:11.982
First of all, both of us
want to thank you..all of you.

01:35:12.587 --> 01:35:14.452
For making it here..at
such a short notice.

01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:17.217
By coming here, all of you proved ..

01:35:17.291 --> 01:35:19.816
..that what our papa said was right.

01:35:20.228 --> 01:35:21.752
He always said that..

01:35:22.163 --> 01:35:26.395
..'friends can make you
feel happiest in the world'.

01:35:27.001 --> 01:35:28.559
And we're very fortunate..

01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:33.805
..that we've so many friends
to be a part of our happiness.

01:35:33.875 --> 01:35:35.206
So thank you..all of you.

01:35:38.279 --> 01:35:39.837
But..but..but..

01:35:40.581 --> 01:35:41.673
There's someone here..

01:35:42.617 --> 01:35:46.178
..who can add to our happiness.

01:35:54.462 --> 01:35:57.625
Siya, you know l love you a lot.

01:35:58.866 --> 01:36:02.666
And l know l'll never
be happy without you.

01:36:03.337 --> 01:36:05.328
So why don't we
live togetherforever..

01:36:06.274 --> 01:36:08.674
..and make each other happy.

01:36:15.283 --> 01:36:16.307
Will you marry me?

01:36:18.453 --> 01:36:20.751
Say yes. - Oh come on say yes.

01:36:21.122 --> 01:36:22.350
Say yes.

01:36:22.523 --> 01:36:24.548
Say yes. - Say yes.

01:36:24.826 --> 01:36:26.691
Come on.

01:36:27.829 --> 01:36:29.660
Say yes.

01:36:30.098 --> 01:36:31.122
Yes!

01:36:35.570 --> 01:36:36.537
l love you!

01:37:09.036 --> 01:37:11.027
Don't doubt me so much.

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:14.029
How many times do l tell you..

01:37:14.142 --> 01:37:15.632
..that l only love you.

01:37:16.511 --> 01:37:18.138
l can't live without you.

01:37:18.713 --> 01:37:21.705
lf that's true then
help me kill Vikram.

01:37:23.518 --> 01:37:24.416
What?

01:37:25.553 --> 01:37:27.180
Aditya..

01:37:27.255 --> 01:37:29.519
Aditya..l

01:37:30.324 --> 01:37:33.350
l cannot kill anyone.

01:37:34.529 --> 01:37:36.019
l can't do it.

01:37:37.131 --> 01:37:38.723
Strange love!

01:37:40.001 --> 01:37:42.435
You don't want to
see your lover happy.

01:37:45.206 --> 01:37:47.640
What happiness will you
get by killing your brother?

01:37:47.742 --> 01:37:49.369
He's not my brother.

01:37:50.144 --> 01:37:51.270
He's my enemy.

01:37:51.479 --> 01:37:53.674
He snatched away
everything l everwanted.

01:37:55.149 --> 01:37:56.173
Mom's favorite son.

01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:57.012
Dad's respect.

01:37:57.084 --> 01:37:59.279
School..College..Studies..Sports..

01:37:59.554 --> 01:38:01.021
He was betterthan me in everything.

01:38:04.058 --> 01:38:06.219
When l fell for you,
he snatched you too.

01:38:07.261 --> 01:38:09.161
l am tired of being no.2.

01:38:10.064 --> 01:38:11.429
l want to be no.1.

01:38:11.599 --> 01:38:13.066
l want to be the best.

01:38:14.802 --> 01:38:15.791
Enough.

01:38:16.837 --> 01:38:17.667
Enough!

01:38:18.773 --> 01:38:20.604
l won't get anything
as long as he's alive.

01:38:23.911 --> 01:38:25.378
l want to be the chairman.

01:38:26.447 --> 01:38:27.505
The owner.

01:38:28.916 --> 01:38:30.383
Are you with me or not?

01:38:32.286 --> 01:38:34.584
Are you with me..or not?

01:38:42.330 --> 01:38:44.230
Definitely l will. Okay.

01:38:46.634 --> 01:38:48.534
Anyway..let's meet and talk.

01:38:48.636 --> 01:38:49.534
Okay, see you.

01:38:51.305 --> 01:38:53.034
Thanks. See you.

01:38:53.374 --> 01:38:55.171
Neha, inform the
pilot that we're ready.

01:38:55.276 --> 01:38:56.174
Okay, sir.

01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:02.781
- l am going to miss you so much.
- l'll miss you too.

01:39:05.453 --> 01:39:06.112
See you.

01:39:47.395 --> 01:39:48.692
You're alive..

01:39:50.531 --> 01:39:52.294
..but yourface.

01:39:54.168 --> 01:39:55.635
How's it possible?

01:39:56.437 --> 01:39:58.496
How can anyone survive
such a plane crash?

01:39:59.507 --> 01:40:01.532
That's why no body was found.

01:40:02.543 --> 01:40:03.908
And with plastic surgery..

01:40:05.379 --> 01:40:06.903
l can't believe it.

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:16.720
Look Vikram, this is not my fault.

01:40:20.795 --> 01:40:21.955
Just shut up.

01:40:25.633 --> 01:40:27.260
l didn't want to..

01:40:29.136 --> 01:40:30.967
..spend a moment with you.

01:40:31.372 --> 01:40:32.532
l still don't.

01:40:33.007 --> 01:40:35.601
l did this to show you the truth.

01:40:37.411 --> 01:40:38.571
And anyway..

01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:41.447
..you were always so cheap..

01:40:43.384 --> 01:40:44.612
..and you still are.

01:40:45.786 --> 01:40:47.447
Only your price has changed.

01:40:55.696 --> 01:40:56.594
What's this?

01:40:57.465 --> 01:40:58.659
With these papers..

01:40:59.567 --> 01:41:00.795
..you must return everything..

01:41:00.868 --> 01:41:03.462
..that you and your
husband took from me.

01:41:06.407 --> 01:41:09.308
You want evidence for
Aditya's innocence, don't you?

01:41:11.445 --> 01:41:13.037
l think you should get going.

01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:21.115
How is that possible?

01:41:22.323 --> 01:41:23.847
Saurav's..Vikram.

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.660
Are you sure? - Yes, Aditya.

01:41:28.362 --> 01:41:32.526
The tattoo..and everything
that l only told Vikram..

01:41:32.733 --> 01:41:34.325
He knows everything.

01:41:34.735 --> 01:41:36.532
He's definitely Vikram.

01:41:38.072 --> 01:41:39.767
Sometimes l feel..

01:41:40.808 --> 01:41:42.969
..God's definitely against me.

01:41:44.378 --> 01:41:46.369
Some game he's playing with me.

01:41:47.381 --> 01:41:48.746
l can hear Him laughing.

01:41:52.353 --> 01:41:54.480
He wants you to sign these papers..

01:41:54.588 --> 01:41:58.217
..and return him his properties,
business, everything.

01:41:58.659 --> 01:42:00.820
Only then will he handover
the evidence to your innocence.

01:42:03.764 --> 01:42:05.664
He's played a really big plan.

01:42:07.001 --> 01:42:08.969
Our plans are foiled.

01:42:10.905 --> 01:42:12.873
What do we do now, Aditya?

01:42:13.474 --> 01:42:16.204
l won't let the Lord win.

01:42:18.045 --> 01:42:20.206
He might have saved Vikram..

01:42:21.482 --> 01:42:23.848
..and got me locked up behind bars..

01:42:25.052 --> 01:42:27.247
..and turned the world against me..

01:42:29.623 --> 01:42:31.420
But l will win.

01:42:32.827 --> 01:42:34.124
Aditya, please.

01:42:35.529 --> 01:42:37.019
You're scaring me now.

01:42:39.333 --> 01:42:43.133
One who falls in a game,
isn't the loser..

01:42:44.638 --> 01:42:47.505
..it's the one who doesn't get up.

01:42:49.710 --> 01:42:53.544
lt's time to rise
up in this game, Siya.

01:43:01.655 --> 01:43:02.815
Here are the papers.

01:43:14.435 --> 01:43:16.630
First handoverthe evidence
to Aditya's innocent.

01:43:17.838 --> 01:43:18.930
S***

01:43:22.142 --> 01:43:23.234
Let me check the papers first.

01:43:23.344 --> 01:43:24.038
Yes.

01:43:31.218 --> 01:43:32.207
What kind of a joke is this?

01:43:35.055 --> 01:43:36.215
Where are his signatures?

01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:38.781
Yourfinger's bleeding.

01:44:05.352 --> 01:44:07.343
Saurav! Saurav! Saurav!

01:44:07.488 --> 01:44:09.251
Saurav! What's wrong?

01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:11.415
Saurav! Are you okay?

01:44:11.825 --> 01:44:12.416
Saurav! Are you okay?

01:44:12.493 --> 01:44:13.755
Saurav! Saurav!

01:44:13.894 --> 01:44:15.384
What did you do to him?

01:44:15.596 --> 01:44:17.496
Saurav! Saurav!

01:44:17.665 --> 01:44:19.257
Saurav! My dear Saurav!

01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:20.362
Saurav!

01:44:21.368 --> 01:44:22.062
Saurav!

01:44:22.236 --> 01:44:23.396
Saurav, are you okay?

01:44:23.904 --> 01:44:25.269
Saurav! Saurav!

01:44:25.372 --> 01:44:28.899
Mr. Dixit,
in an hour's time he'll be dead.

01:44:29.577 --> 01:44:31.477
By the time you take
him to the hospital..

01:44:31.579 --> 01:44:35.481
..they conduct the tests
and give him an antidote..

01:44:35.649 --> 01:44:37.514
..it'll be too late.

01:44:40.588 --> 01:44:41.452
So what do we do?

01:44:44.258 --> 01:44:48.627
There's one way. - Yes.

01:44:49.029 --> 01:44:51.361
lf l tell you the
name of this poison.

01:44:51.532 --> 01:44:52.931
Tell me! Tell me!

01:44:53.867 --> 01:44:56.165
But forthat,
without wasting his time..

01:44:56.337 --> 01:45:00.239
..you must right away
handover all the evidence..

01:45:00.341 --> 01:45:02.002
..to Aditya's innocence.

01:45:03.477 --> 01:45:05.741
Come on, be quick for his sake.

01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:08.045
Saurav, just be there.

01:45:08.349 --> 01:45:09.646
Saurav, just be there.

01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:13.816
Here.

01:45:14.288 --> 01:45:15.346
Tell me the name.

01:45:18.759 --> 01:45:19.691
Saurav! Saurav!

01:45:19.793 --> 01:45:20.691
Saurav!

01:45:20.794 --> 01:45:21.988
Tell me the name.

01:45:22.763 --> 01:45:25.231
Saurav! Saurav! You'll be alright.

01:45:25.432 --> 01:45:26.421
Belladonna.

01:45:28.369 --> 01:45:30.394
Saurav. You'll be alright.

01:45:30.504 --> 01:45:32.904
Saurav! Saurav!

01:45:44.818 --> 01:45:46.012
Mr. Dixit.

01:45:46.787 --> 01:45:47.811
Mr. Dixit.

01:45:48.322 --> 01:45:49.880
Yes doctor.

01:45:50.691 --> 01:45:53.489
We've given Mr.
Singhania the antidote.

01:45:53.694 --> 01:45:56.322
But..forthe next 12 hours
l can't promise anything.

01:45:56.463 --> 01:45:57.691
Anything is possible.

01:45:57.898 --> 01:46:00.731
And we don't know whether
it has affected any organ.

01:46:01.101 --> 01:46:02.659
Only time can tell.

01:46:04.405 --> 01:46:05.337
Don't worry.

01:46:13.447 --> 01:46:16.644
"'The air pressure overthe
Arabian sea is decreasing."

01:46:16.817 --> 01:46:19.285
"'Due to which the
weather is changing."

01:46:19.486 --> 01:46:21.386
'lf we talk about North lndia..'

01:46:21.455 --> 01:46:25.255
'..entire Northern region of lndia has
been impacted by cold waves as we speak.'

01:46:25.359 --> 01:46:27.486
'Due to heavy snowfalls in Srinagar..'

01:46:27.594 --> 01:46:31.394
'..the temperature has dipped
below minus 3 degrees.'

01:46:32.666 --> 01:46:35.362
'Breaking News of the hour is..'

01:46:35.436 --> 01:46:38.269
'..that Kaaya Sharma's
real murderer has been found.'

01:46:38.605 --> 01:46:40.596
'The police recently recovered..'

01:46:40.774 --> 01:46:43.402
'..the body of a man called
Manish Surve from a van..'

01:46:43.477 --> 01:46:45.274
'..parked outside a farmhouse.'

01:46:45.479 --> 01:46:48.243
'The police have also stated
that this is a suicide case.'

01:46:48.449 --> 01:46:50.974
'Police have also found
some love-letters..'

01:46:51.051 --> 01:46:52.040
'..and photographs
from Manish's home..'

01:46:52.119 --> 01:46:53.984
'..which he wrote to Kaaya.'

01:46:54.221 --> 01:46:56.280
'The police have also said..'

01:46:56.490 --> 01:46:58.856
'..that these pictures
and love-letters prove that..'

01:46:58.926 --> 01:47:00.621
'..Manish Surve was a silent lover.'

01:47:01.095 --> 01:47:03.791
'And his obsession was the
motive behind Kaaya's murder.'

01:47:03.931 --> 01:47:06.627
Mr. Diwan, now that you've
been acquitted, how do you feel?

01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:09.328
Do you know who was
trying to instigate you?

01:47:10.404 --> 01:47:13.703
All l know is that l had
full faith in the judicial system.

01:47:14.241 --> 01:47:16.801
And l am happy that the
truth is before the world.

01:47:17.077 --> 01:47:19.637
And everyone knows l am innocent,

01:47:20.114 --> 01:47:20.409
Thank you.

01:47:20.481 --> 01:47:21.539
Sir..sir..one more question.

01:47:21.648 --> 01:47:22.706
Sir. - Sir please sir.

01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:34.158
Yes.

01:47:35.529 --> 01:47:36.621
Yes.

01:47:37.765 --> 01:47:40.325
Right now all we can do is wait.

01:47:41.034 --> 01:47:42.968
The doctor's said that
anything is possible.

01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:46.096
Sir, Mr. Singhania
is not in his room. - What?

01:48:06.794 --> 01:48:09.456
Welcome back, sir. - Thank you.

01:48:11.265 --> 01:48:13.062
Good morning, sir. - Morning.

01:48:32.152 --> 01:48:35.144
Vaswani, was it so important
to come here today?

01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:38.385
Bringing me to a place like
this right after l got out of jail.

01:48:39.326 --> 01:48:41.590
Sir, this project was
on hold for a long time.

01:48:41.829 --> 01:48:43.820
And we've invested
lot of money in it.

01:48:44.231 --> 01:48:45.892
l thought why don't l
take final approval from you..

01:48:45.966 --> 01:48:47.957
..and start it again. - Okay.

01:48:49.002 --> 01:48:50.993
Sir, l'll get the blueprint.

01:49:15.128 --> 01:49:15.856
Within two weeks..

01:49:15.963 --> 01:49:17.521
..Aditya group of company's
should have a clean image..

01:49:17.598 --> 01:49:19.361
..amongst the public.

01:49:19.566 --> 01:49:21.864
Yes, we can't afford
to waste anymore time now.

01:49:22.035 --> 01:49:24.526
Don't worry,
we've already prepared a strategy.

01:49:34.848 --> 01:49:36.406
This is the
only way to cover our losses.

01:49:36.683 --> 01:49:39.447
We've all the reports.. - Sir,
your lives are in danger.

01:49:39.553 --> 01:49:41.453
- We must leave immediately.
- What's wrong?

01:49:41.622 --> 01:49:42.680
Saurav's here.

01:49:42.856 --> 01:49:45.051
We've to leave immediately,
let's go.

01:49:54.234 --> 01:49:54.791
Oh, Gosh!

01:49:54.968 --> 01:49:57.300
What happened? - Run! Hurry up.

01:49:57.571 --> 01:49:58.629
Come on.

01:51:18.151 --> 01:51:19.516
l am sorry, Vikram.

01:51:21.388 --> 01:51:22.650
l am really sorry.

01:51:25.459 --> 01:51:27.689
This was entirely Aditya's plan,
not mine.

01:51:28.495 --> 01:51:30.588
l let Aditya influence me.

01:51:32.766 --> 01:51:36.133
Please give me a chance
to prove that l still love you.

01:51:37.537 --> 01:51:38.765
l was right..

01:51:40.741 --> 01:51:42.800
You were always
cheap..and you still are.

01:51:43.577 --> 01:51:45.101
Please believe me, Vikram.

01:51:46.313 --> 01:51:47.803
l'll give you anything you want.

01:51:47.914 --> 01:51:48.812
Whatever.

01:51:49.883 --> 01:51:52.818
l've realized..Aditya's
can be no one's

01:51:56.323 --> 01:51:57.585
l am sorry.

01:52:04.297 --> 01:52:05.286
Really?

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:07.594
Let's hear your offer.

01:52:10.771 --> 01:52:12.295
My offer is behind you!

01:52:23.450 --> 01:52:25.611
There's no difference
between you and me.

01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:28.445
Whatever l did,
it was forthe money..

01:52:29.623 --> 01:52:31.215
..and now you're doing the same.

01:52:44.771 --> 01:52:45.863
There's a difference.

01:52:47.007 --> 01:52:48.872
Your desires were in the sky..

01:52:49.876 --> 01:52:51.241
..and mine was on earth.

01:53:48.602 --> 01:53:51.264
l cried more on the
inside than l smiled!

01:53:51.538 --> 01:53:53.438
l hated you!

01:54:03.216 --> 01:54:04.410
What's strange is that..

01:54:04.484 --> 01:54:07.146
..how did you survive
after killing you twice?

01:54:07.787 --> 01:54:11.279
But l think God will
fulfill my desire today.

01:55:22.095 --> 01:55:24.461
You kept praying
to God..for my death..

01:55:26.866 --> 01:55:28.333
..and kept praying for your deaths.

01:55:37.143 --> 01:55:39.043
Now you'll know how it feels..

01:55:39.346 --> 01:55:40.643
..when some kin cheats you..

01:55:42.682 --> 01:55:45.378
..and deserts you.

01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:36.062
You nevertried to
understand your brother.

01:56:47.247 --> 01:56:48.976
You could've just said it once..

01:56:51.384 --> 01:56:53.511
..and he would've happily
given you everything.

01:56:55.388 --> 01:56:57.686
He would've given me everything?

01:57:02.262 --> 01:57:03.422
Then who are you?

01:57:04.998 --> 01:57:05.828
Who are you?

01:57:05.899 --> 01:57:08.424
l regret you'll never
know this secret in this life.

01:57:37.764 --> 01:57:40.733
Saurav! Saurav! Saurav!

01:57:41.167 --> 01:57:42.099

Saurav! Saurav!

01:58:04.958 --> 01:58:07.290
Karan is conscious.

01:58:08.294 --> 01:58:09.386
He's going to live.

01:58:15.969 --> 01:58:17.266
'The game has begun.'

01:58:17.370 --> 01:58:19.600
'Saurav has entrapped Kaaya.'

01:58:19.706 --> 01:58:20.730
'Kaaya is dead.'

01:58:29.682 --> 01:58:31.343
He had a friend called Karan.

01:58:31.518 --> 01:58:34.009
Vikram would eat,
sleep and play with him.

01:58:35.188 --> 01:58:36.678
He had a problem with his liver.

01:58:39.592 --> 01:58:41.082
Vikram didn't think twice..

01:58:41.161 --> 01:58:45.291
..before deciding to
donate half of his liver..

01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:49.994
Karan my friend,

01:58:51.104 --> 01:58:55.165

You gave me this life.

02:01:08.374 --> 02:01:10.239
You proved one thing.

02:01:12.779 --> 02:01:16.044
Blood ties are not
the only relation..

02:01:17.383 --> 02:01:19.351
..the real relation is of pain.

02:01:21.187 --> 02:01:23.781
lt's easy to be called brother..

02:01:25.725 --> 02:01:29.161
..but difficult to be one.

02:01:32.532 --> 02:01:34.796
You're my real brother.

02:01:36.836 --> 02:01:38.326
You're my real brother.

02:01:40.273 --> 02:01:41.763
You're my real brother.

02:02:26.753 --> 02:02:36.128
"l'm obsessed..to make you mine."

02:02:36.262 --> 02:02:38.856
"Since long."

02:02:39.866 --> 02:02:46.772

"Take a look.."

02:03:53.506 --> 02:03:56.100
"at my condition too."

02:03:56.209 --> 02:04:00.043
l'm completely
shattered to pieces.

02:04:00.613 --> 02:04:03.104
"There's no turning back now."

02:04:03.282 --> 02:04:06.012
"Whateverthis is, it feels right."

02:04:06.285 --> 02:04:09.345

02:04:30.276 --> 02:04:36.511
"is what l have to say to you."

02:04:36.682 --> 02:04:46.148
"l'm obsessed..to make you mine."

02:04:46.259 --> 02:04:48.853
