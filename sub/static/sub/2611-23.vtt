WEBVTT

00:14.455 --> 00:15.873
Like the drive?

00:15.873 --> 00:16.916
Scenic.

00:16.916 --> 00:18.209
Guy lives in a barn?

00:18.543 --> 00:20.128
Yeah. What do you got,
gentlemen?

00:20.128 --> 00:23.005
We saw our victim,
he's a white male, he's 25,

00:23.005 --> 00:24.132
and he's bound
with duct tape.

00:24.340 --> 00:25.216
You been in yet?

00:25.216 --> 00:27.093
Nope.
Waiting on you guys.

00:27.093 --> 00:28.928
All right, gentlemen,
let's do it.

00:29.971 --> 00:31.013
Let's go.

00:52.952 --> 00:54.454
We've got yellow
powder on the table.

00:54.454 --> 00:56.789
Bathtub
methamphetamine.

00:56.998 --> 00:58.040
Speed.

00:59.500 --> 01:01.544
Cocaine high, no off button.

01:01.544 --> 01:03.588
I've seen people stay up
for fifteen days on it.

01:03.588 --> 01:04.464
Look at this place,

01:04.464 --> 01:06.924
disassembled radios,
TVs taken apart.

01:08.176 --> 01:10.678
Tweakers just tweak stuff
till they drop, don't they?

01:11.179 --> 01:12.388
He doesn't look like
he dropped.

01:12.388 --> 01:14.390
He looks like somebody
beat the crap out of him.

01:14.390 --> 01:16.309
Could've been the
result of an argument.

01:16.309 --> 01:18.394
Problem is, when a
meth-head starts something ...

01:18.394 --> 01:19.437
No off button.

01:28.488 --> 01:29.655
Just take it easy.

01:32.784 --> 01:34.118
Something ...

01:34.869 --> 01:36.496
is not right here.

01:38.289 --> 01:40.166
Tweakers love their porn.

01:51.969 --> 01:53.805
Let's see how
kinky our guy was.

01:55.973 --> 01:57.100
Eric ...

01:57.391 --> 01:58.476
run.

02:00.061 --> 02:01.687
Everybody, run!

02:02.605 --> 02:05.233
Get out, everybody out!

02:53.197 --> 02:56.325
1x23 Freaks and Tweaks

03:19.472 --> 03:21.349
You okay?
Yeah.

03:21.557 --> 03:22.475
Thanks, H.

03:22.475 --> 03:25.520
Under the heading of "no crime
scene is ever safe," huh?

03:25.520 --> 03:26.521
Lesson learned.

03:26.521 --> 03:27.855
The problem is that
our murder scene...

03:27.855 --> 03:30.149
has been compromised
in a very big way.

03:30.149 --> 03:31.442
Bomb squad's
through sweeping.

03:31.442 --> 03:32.277
You're up.

03:32.277 --> 03:33.319
Okay.

03:41.995 --> 03:43.079
Just you and me?

03:43.079 --> 03:44.914
You sound disappointed.

03:46.583 --> 03:47.542
Joe family man.

03:47.542 --> 03:49.127
Makes a milk run to the
convenience store ...

03:49.127 --> 03:50.670
and gets popped.

03:50.753 --> 03:52.839
No wallet.
Figured robbery.

03:53.673 --> 03:54.674
Shot in the heart.

03:54.674 --> 03:56.593
That's kind of personal,
don't you think?

03:56.593 --> 03:57.677
I do.

03:57.677 --> 03:59.929
So I had patrol
canvass for the wallet.

03:59.929 --> 04:01.472
Found it over there
in the trash.

04:01.472 --> 04:03.558
Cash,
credit cards.

04:08.271 --> 04:10.023
I've got two rounds here,
and, you know,

04:10.023 --> 04:12.859
maybe I can get a
fingerprint off of this one.

04:12.859 --> 04:13.693
No way.

04:13.693 --> 04:15.778
Heat from the primer
burns the prints off.

04:21.117 --> 04:23.119
That's true, except
this one is unspent,

04:23.119 --> 04:24.329
so it didn't go through
the barrel.

04:24.329 --> 04:26.915
I guess the primer probably
malfunctioned because of humidity,

04:26.915 --> 04:29.834
so when the firing pin hit it,
nothing, it was a dud.

04:33.546 --> 04:35.882
Hopefully leaving behind
a set of fingerprints.

04:36.925 --> 04:38.176
I stand corrected.

04:38.176 --> 04:39.928
That's what I like
about you, Hagen.

04:41.179 --> 04:42.472
Oh, my god.

04:42.472 --> 04:43.556
Calleigh?

04:45.433 --> 04:47.226
His name's
Dennis Harmon.

04:47.226 --> 04:48.353
You know him?

04:51.481 --> 04:52.941
I know someone who does.

04:57.654 --> 04:59.697
Yes, I remember my
christmas party.

04:59.697 --> 05:00.823
I told you no gifts,

05:00.823 --> 05:02.659
you brought one for
each of my kids.

05:02.659 --> 05:03.493
Why?

05:03.493 --> 05:06.621
The couple there, the Harmons,
Dennis and Julie.

05:06.621 --> 05:07.413
Yeah.

05:07.413 --> 05:08.790
Two of my oldest friends.

05:08.790 --> 05:09.832
What about them?

05:19.342 --> 05:20.426
No.

05:23.554 --> 05:25.098
Dennis ...

05:26.349 --> 05:27.767
we're still young.

05:29.519 --> 05:30.645
Oh, Dennis ...

05:31.688 --> 05:34.274
You know, Alexx, you could
reassign this to another M.E.

05:34.274 --> 05:37.193
I talked to Jones, and he said
he'd be willing to take it.

05:45.159 --> 05:46.202
I'm all right.

06:01.509 --> 06:03.261
His pupils are dilated.

06:03.386 --> 06:06.097
Opposite of what they'd
normally do at death.

06:06.097 --> 06:08.016
I'll get blood to tox.

06:09.058 --> 06:10.518
Homicide notified Julie yet?

06:10.518 --> 06:12.020
I should be there when
they talk to her.

06:12.020 --> 06:14.397
Yes, Hagen is doing it.
He's doing it.

06:14.397 --> 06:15.315
And, Alexx,

06:15.315 --> 06:17.275
there's something else that
I think you ought to know.

06:18.651 --> 06:22.113
This killing has the marks of
an acquaintance murder.

06:22.113 --> 06:24.324
There was a faked robber
and a bullet to the heart,

06:24.324 --> 06:25.575
that sort of a thing.

06:30.830 --> 06:32.749
Oh, it's got to be a random.

06:33.082 --> 06:35.501
Dennis wouldn't get
caught up in something like ...

06:37.170 --> 06:38.421
Listen to me.

06:38.838 --> 06:41.758
Like every victim's friend
comes down here,

06:41.758 --> 06:44.761
thinking I know somebody,
what they'd be caught up in.

06:45.803 --> 06:47.180
Truth is...

06:48.222 --> 06:50.350
nobody really
knows anyone.

06:51.267 --> 06:52.477
It's all clear.

06:53.311 --> 06:55.480
Lots of blast damage.

06:55.772 --> 06:57.148
This was no little pipe bomb.

06:57.148 --> 06:59.108
No. Probably dynamite.
Yeah.

06:59.108 --> 07:01.903
Enhanced by gasoline,
set on a time delay.

07:01.903 --> 07:03.446
Yeah.
Lucky for you.

07:03.529 --> 07:05.907
We're talking at least
16,000 feet per second.

07:05.907 --> 07:08.076
Really?
Felt like fifteen.

07:08.618 --> 07:09.577
Thank you.

07:09.577 --> 07:10.703
Right.

07:12.497 --> 07:14.582
What I don't get is, if you're
trying to destroy evidence,

07:14.582 --> 07:16.668
why not put the device
right next to the body?

07:16.668 --> 07:18.169
He wasn't trying
to cover a murder.

07:18.169 --> 07:19.921
He rigged the
bomb for kicks ...

07:19.921 --> 07:22.006
and destroyed
evidence as a bonus.

07:25.885 --> 07:27.428
Another piece of the guitar.

07:27.845 --> 07:29.305
Blew that thing apart, huh?

07:29.305 --> 07:32.433
Yeah, I've been picking up
pieces of this all over the room.

07:35.687 --> 07:36.729
Guitar string.

07:39.857 --> 07:40.900
Check this out.

07:43.403 --> 07:46.322
That's some sort of material
adhered to the surface.

07:47.365 --> 07:48.616
That's a capacitor.

07:48.616 --> 07:50.201
Energy storage unit?

07:50.201 --> 07:52.036
The first component
of our bomb.

07:52.036 --> 07:55.248
Judging by the oxidation, we're
near the seat of detonation.

07:55.248 --> 07:56.624
Part of the signature?

07:58.084 --> 08:01.629
If we I.D. the signature,
we can I.D. the suspect.

08:03.172 --> 08:04.674
So how is our Tweaker?

08:04.882 --> 08:07.385
What is it with white
boys and duct tape?

08:09.470 --> 08:11.055
Tape's hardly damaged.

08:11.055 --> 08:13.182
They say that roaches
and duct tape ...

08:13.182 --> 08:14.851
will survive the
end of the world.

08:14.892 --> 08:16.686
Well, at least
something's in our favor.

08:16.978 --> 08:19.022
Killer's prints might
be on this.

08:19.022 --> 08:20.565
So, is that the last of it?

08:20.565 --> 08:22.567
Yeah.
Don't get confused.

08:22.567 --> 08:24.527
I marked my cuts
with black ink.

08:24.527 --> 08:25.361
Got it.

08:25.361 --> 08:26.654
I'll be in trace.

08:27.697 --> 08:30.617
I'm going to need a ten-card
on this guy ASAP, all right?

08:30.825 --> 08:32.534
More like a one-card.

08:32.744 --> 08:34.370
Hands are singed.

08:34.787 --> 08:35.914
All right.

08:36.246 --> 08:37.664
I'll take what I can get.

08:38.416 --> 08:42.879
I'm finding a lot of this material
inside your victim's head wound.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.131
This is the biggest
piece so far.

08:45.131 --> 08:47.133
That looks like wood.
Is it from the blast?

08:47.133 --> 08:47.884
No.

08:47.884 --> 08:50.470
Hemorrhagic tissue
indicates he was alive...

08:50.470 --> 08:53.097
when the wood
fragmented with the impact.

08:53.097 --> 08:54.223
Blunt force trauma.

08:57.018 --> 08:59.145
So we're talking about a
possible murder weapon.

08:59.145 --> 09:00.480
Murder was redundant.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.899
He only had a year or
so by the looks of his liver.

09:02.899 --> 09:04.275
Let's find out ...

09:04.275 --> 09:06.694
who stole the last twelve
months of his life, all right?

09:08.363 --> 09:09.530
Maple.

09:09.614 --> 09:10.698
Nice.

09:11.199 --> 09:14.244
How much of the pre-explosion
crime scene do you remember?

09:14.244 --> 09:15.787
About three pages worth.

09:15.787 --> 09:17.080
I'll put it in my F.I. report.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.414
You remember a pool table?

09:18.748 --> 09:19.874
No. I wouldn't
have missed that.

09:19.874 --> 09:21.793
Our murder weapon
is a pool cue.

09:21.793 --> 09:22.877
Take a look at that.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.338
That's at 400x.

09:25.338 --> 09:27.715
Pool cues are made
from pressed wood,

09:27.715 --> 09:30.468
20 laminates per inch.

09:30.468 --> 09:31.928
What's the shiny stuff?

09:32.011 --> 09:33.513
The shiny stuff is sugar.

09:33.638 --> 09:34.722
Sap.

09:35.431 --> 09:37.350
Standard Canadian Maple.

09:37.892 --> 09:40.853
So we got two tweakers up
for days getting cranked,

09:40.853 --> 09:42.480
start scratching
at each other.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.607
Our victim gets
subdued somehow,

09:44.607 --> 09:47.026
bound with duct tape and beat
to death with a pool cue.

09:47.026 --> 09:48.111
Hey, guys.

09:48.111 --> 09:50.738
The title to the crime scene
is held by Judith Lindeman.

09:50.738 --> 09:52.615
Rents to our victim,
Darwin Capshaw.

09:52.615 --> 09:54.200
Darwin?
That's ironic.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.076
He's in the system,

09:55.076 --> 09:56.119
small-time drug dealer.

09:56.119 --> 09:57.495
Which means he
has enemies.

09:57.495 --> 09:58.788
I took a look at his friends.

09:58.788 --> 10:01.374
Last time he was arrested,
the report listed a crime partner:

10:01.374 --> 10:03.251
Tommy Lee Harkins.

10:03.251 --> 10:04.460
Tommy Lee Harkins!

10:04.460 --> 10:06.337
Let's bring him in.

10:06.337 --> 10:08.506
You seem very
agitated to me.

10:08.506 --> 10:09.799
Very agitated.

10:09.799 --> 10:11.426
Is that the meth?

10:11.426 --> 10:13.886
I wasn't ...
no, I'm not agitated, no.

10:16.472 --> 10:19.267
Are the shadow people
chasing you, Tommy?

10:19.267 --> 10:21.603
Is that the meth playing
with your head?

10:21.603 --> 10:23.646
Look at those
eyes, Frank.

10:24.147 --> 10:26.232
Take a look
at those eyes.

10:27.275 --> 10:28.401
Tommy...

10:28.818 --> 10:32.196
did you and Darwin have
an argument that escalated?

10:32.614 --> 10:34.073
N-no.
Okay.

10:34.699 --> 10:36.159
What's that on your shirt?

10:44.208 --> 10:46.878
It's-it's-it's nothing, man.

10:48.755 --> 10:50.256
I had a burger on
the way here.

10:50.256 --> 10:51.674
No, you didn't.
You didn't have a burger.

10:51.674 --> 10:53.885
You're cranked, your body
wouldn't accept food,

10:53.885 --> 10:55.178
so you did not
have a burger.

10:55.178 --> 10:56.554
Don't lie to me.

10:56.554 --> 10:58.681
It looks like blood,

10:58.681 --> 11:00.058
and if it's blood,
Tommy,

11:00.058 --> 11:03.269
that means you were within feet
of Darwin during the beating.

11:04.312 --> 11:06.356
Which also tells me
you participated.

11:07.398 --> 11:10.902
Okay, I was there,
but I didn't do nothing.

11:11.945 --> 11:13.154
It was Chaz.

11:14.197 --> 11:17.242
When he was beating
on Darwin, I bailed.

11:17.242 --> 11:18.409
Who is Chaz?

11:18.743 --> 11:21.746
Um ...
plays the banjo ...

11:23.206 --> 11:24.666
All night, all day.

11:25.708 --> 11:27.168
Crazy ass weird songs.

11:27.168 --> 11:28.628
Why was he beating
on Darwin?

11:29.462 --> 11:32.674
Darwin told Chaz that
his music sucked.

11:32.757 --> 11:34.133
Your music sucks, man.

11:34.133 --> 11:37.053
Nothing worse than
what you play.

11:37.262 --> 11:38.346
So Chaz ...

11:39.389 --> 11:44.602
he knocked him
on his ass.

11:45.270 --> 11:47.313
He was ...
laughing ...

11:47.855 --> 11:49.274
while he taped
him up,

11:49.274 --> 11:51.484
and then he beat on
him some more.

11:51.693 --> 11:52.944
With a pool cue.

11:57.991 --> 12:00.076
Yeah.
Yes.

12:00.493 --> 12:02.161
How'd you know all this?

12:02.495 --> 12:04.038
I'm magic.

12:09.210 --> 12:10.503
Did he kill the girl?

12:12.088 --> 12:13.172
What girl?

12:13.881 --> 12:16.759
Just a girl that
Chaz brought around.

12:17.677 --> 12:20.305
You know what, Frank,
let's put out a broadcast.

12:20.305 --> 12:22.181
Maybe the girl
is still alive.

12:26.518 --> 12:29.270
Ma'am, did your husband
have any enemies?

12:29.479 --> 12:30.355
Enemies?

12:30.355 --> 12:32.023
Business, personal ...

12:32.023 --> 12:34.984
He's a dentist.
I'm a doctor.

12:34.984 --> 12:39.864
The only people we know
are people at the club or ...

12:40.198 --> 12:41.574
or at the kids' school.

12:41.908 --> 12:43.159
Was there a
chance perhaps...

12:43.159 --> 12:46.663
that he was seeing someone
outside of the marriage?

12:46.663 --> 12:50.834
Our marriage,
our family is our life.

12:52.877 --> 12:54.421
No, there's no one.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.385
You okay?

13:03.430 --> 13:05.390
I can't believe it.
I just can't.

13:05.473 --> 13:08.309
I know, baby,
I know.

13:10.979 --> 13:13.231
I don't think I can
tell the kids.

13:13.231 --> 13:14.691
They're going
to remember ...

13:14.691 --> 13:17.402
who told them
the rest of their lives.

13:18.361 --> 13:20.447
I don't think
I'm strong enough.

13:20.655 --> 13:21.948
I'll go with you.

13:21.948 --> 13:23.199
I can't ask you to do that.

13:23.199 --> 13:24.784
Yes, you can.

13:24.784 --> 13:27.203
We'll get through this.

13:29.289 --> 13:30.749
We'll get through this, honey.

13:35.128 --> 13:37.172
Get any prints off
the tape from Darwin?

13:37.172 --> 13:38.256
No, nothing.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.677
...the duct tape
is pretty standard.

13:42.677 --> 13:44.596
Polyethylene resin
on one side,

13:44.596 --> 13:45.680
adhesive on the other.

13:45.680 --> 13:48.016
Nothing unique enough
to lead us to this guy.

13:48.016 --> 13:50.685
Yeah, by itself, duct tape is
virtually untraceable,

13:50.685 --> 13:52.771
but look at this section
from the ankles ...

13:52.771 --> 13:54.898
and this section
from the wrists.

13:57.484 --> 13:58.610
Lock and key.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.695
On this mouth section,

14:00.695 --> 14:02.781
there's a physical
match with the wrists.

14:05.909 --> 14:08.369
Torn consecutively from
the same roll of tape.

14:10.955 --> 14:13.208
We find that tape, we can
match it to one of these ends.

14:13.208 --> 14:15.960
Yeah, hey, he's got
something in his pocket.

14:16.169 --> 14:17.337
More tape?

14:17.337 --> 14:18.338
It looks like paper.

14:18.338 --> 14:19.130
Can you read it?

14:19.130 --> 14:20.757
No.
Char damage,

14:20.757 --> 14:23.259
it's pretty bad.
I'll be in QD.

14:24.302 --> 14:25.386
There it is.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.222
Think you can
do something with it?

14:29.808 --> 14:31.184
Careful, man.

14:31.476 --> 14:32.560
It's fragile.

14:32.560 --> 14:35.605
Yeah, it's the only link
we have to a tweak killer,

14:35.605 --> 14:37.232
so if you're going
to make it worse,

14:37.232 --> 14:39.317
just maybe forget it.

14:40.110 --> 14:41.778
I got a way to do it.

14:50.662 --> 14:53.873
This paralene will
adhere to the paper.

14:54.374 --> 14:55.542
It hardens it.

14:56.584 --> 14:58.670
Makes it stable
enough for analysis.

15:11.433 --> 15:12.475
All right.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.192
Looks the same.

15:21.192 --> 15:23.695
Looks are misleading.

15:35.749 --> 15:37.000
Why infrared?

15:37.000 --> 15:38.960
Charred ink absorbs ...

15:38.960 --> 15:41.045
light at a different wavelength
than charred paper.

15:41.045 --> 15:42.088
Lets us see it.

15:46.760 --> 15:47.552
There you go.

15:47.552 --> 15:48.845
A name and
a phone number.

15:48.845 --> 15:50.138
Yeah, but it's a
cell phone number.

15:50.138 --> 15:52.223
Meth-heads don't
use land lines.

15:52.223 --> 15:54.058
You shouldn't
sneak up on people.

15:54.058 --> 15:55.143
Chaz isn't people,

15:55.143 --> 15:58.688
so let's break out the global
positioner and sneak up on him.

16:21.544 --> 16:23.296
There's a lot of
extension cords.

16:23.630 --> 16:25.757
They're not people who
pay their electric bill.

16:25.882 --> 16:27.050
Free power.

16:27.258 --> 16:28.718
SWAT team move
into final position.

16:38.937 --> 16:41.147
Get out of there!
Let's go!

16:41.147 --> 16:44.359
Who turned my lights off, man?
I can't see my hands.

16:44.359 --> 16:46.820
Police department!
Everyone on the ground now!

16:46.820 --> 16:47.862
Move!

16:56.996 --> 16:59.290
Would everybody
please stand up!

17:04.712 --> 17:07.882
We're looking for
somebody named Chaz.

17:08.090 --> 17:10.468
Chaz beat a Darwin
Capshaw to death.

17:10.468 --> 17:12.220
Had a young woman
he was going to do next.

17:12.220 --> 17:13.179
Anybody seen her?

17:13.179 --> 17:14.722
Know of her whereabouts?

17:16.808 --> 17:18.601
Ladies and gentlemen,
if this lady dies,

17:18.601 --> 17:21.311
and you have knowledge of her,
you are an accomplice.

17:22.355 --> 17:23.522
Am I understood?

17:24.566 --> 17:25.900
Okay, here's what
I want you to do:

17:25.900 --> 17:28.278
Everybody take their left
hand and stick it out, please.

17:28.278 --> 17:29.362
Left hands.

17:31.448 --> 17:33.241
Your other left hand, scruffy.

17:35.535 --> 17:36.828
Very good.

17:39.956 --> 17:41.040
Thank you.

17:42.417 --> 17:45.336
Oh, boy.
Thank you.

17:47.964 --> 17:50.717
Very interesting calluses.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.303
So you're a guitar player ...

17:54.053 --> 17:55.472
Chaz.

17:57.557 --> 17:58.975
Where's the girl?

18:00.018 --> 18:01.561
I know all about you.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.105
Lieutenant Horatio Caine.

18:04.397 --> 18:06.524
Homicide.
Bomb squad.

18:06.524 --> 18:08.068
I run you in on something?

18:08.068 --> 18:11.071
I actually know your brother,
Officer Raymond Caine.

18:11.696 --> 18:12.739
Well, I ...

18:13.364 --> 18:15.366
I knew your brother.

18:16.201 --> 18:17.577
Big meth-head.

18:19.037 --> 18:21.039
God he loved his crank,
didn't he?

18:22.415 --> 18:24.250
You probably know
that, don't you?

18:24.876 --> 18:26.669
Considering you had
to do the mop-up ...

18:26.669 --> 18:27.796
on him after he
checked out.

18:27.796 --> 18:29.297
Chaz ...

18:30.340 --> 18:31.758
if you don't tell me
where this girl is,

18:31.758 --> 18:33.885
I'm going to tear this
place apart, you understand?

18:34.636 --> 18:36.137
Whatever.

18:37.388 --> 18:38.723
I just crash here.

18:38.932 --> 18:41.559
Okay, you had your chance.

18:41.976 --> 18:43.853
Call in the cadaver
dogs, please.

18:45.855 --> 18:47.065
Hi, Calleigh.

18:47.482 --> 18:48.608
Hey.

18:48.817 --> 18:49.818
Any luck on AFIS?

18:49.818 --> 18:52.779
Done run out, and done moved
on to a different database.

18:52.779 --> 18:54.572
Miami employees.

19:03.164 --> 19:04.707
Well, looks like
we got our shooter.

19:04.707 --> 19:06.167
Brad Kenner.

19:06.167 --> 19:09.712
No priors.
22 years young.

19:10.213 --> 19:11.714
I'll arrange an interview.

19:12.757 --> 19:14.008
You know Dennis Harmon?

19:14.134 --> 19:15.009
No.

19:15.009 --> 19:16.928
Then how did your
bullet get in him?

19:17.971 --> 19:19.806
You put this bullet
in the magazine.

19:19.806 --> 19:20.974
That's your fingerprint.

19:25.270 --> 19:26.438
First one was a dud.

19:26.438 --> 19:28.106
Second one got
him right in the heart.

19:29.149 --> 19:30.316
Never met the man.

19:30.942 --> 19:31.818
Okay.

19:31.818 --> 19:32.861
He's a stranger.

19:33.695 --> 19:35.488
You try to carjack him,

19:35.488 --> 19:36.656
things went sideways?
No.

19:36.656 --> 19:39.409
Brad, I don't think you understand
the evidence that we have.

19:39.409 --> 19:42.620
Ridge analysis says that you,
and only you, loaded the gun ...

19:42.620 --> 19:44.164
...and I can tell you
exactly where you keep it,

19:44.164 --> 19:45.457
you either keep it in
your basement...

19:45.457 --> 19:48.042
or you keep it at your place of
employment at the loading docks.

19:48.042 --> 19:50.128
And the reason that I know
this is is because ...

19:50.128 --> 19:52.213
...humidity caused the
primer to malfunction.

19:52.213 --> 19:53.923
There aren't a lot of
basements in Florida,

19:53.923 --> 19:56.009
so my bet is,
it's at the loading dock.

19:56.342 --> 19:59.387
I'll drive over there
right now, recover your gun.

20:00.722 --> 20:02.307
It's not my gun,
it's a friend's.

20:02.307 --> 20:03.308
What's his name?

20:03.308 --> 20:05.435
It's a she.
She's older.

20:05.435 --> 20:06.561
What's her name?

20:07.520 --> 20:08.688
Julie Harmon.

20:08.688 --> 20:10.273
The wife of the deceased.

20:10.273 --> 20:11.524
Do you have her picture?

20:11.524 --> 20:12.567
Yeah.

20:25.497 --> 20:26.956
That is Julie Harmon.

20:29.042 --> 20:30.418
She's a pretty woman.

20:30.835 --> 20:32.170
Yeah, she is.

20:32.170 --> 20:33.546
She's a lot of things.

20:34.089 --> 20:35.131
You meet her in a bar?

20:35.131 --> 20:36.841
Her office.
She's an eye doctor.

20:36.841 --> 20:39.302
Julie know you were going
to shoot her husband?

20:39.844 --> 20:41.304
Yeah.
She told me to.

20:49.979 --> 20:51.064
Alexx!

20:51.481 --> 20:52.399
Alexx ...wait.

20:52.399 --> 20:55.068
Why would she lie to
me to my face?

20:55.068 --> 20:56.403
Why would she
have me sit there...

20:56.403 --> 20:58.071
and tell her kids
their daddy passed...

20:58.071 --> 21:00.573
like she had no idea why?

21:00.573 --> 21:03.034
My friend, to my face.

21:03.034 --> 21:04.119
I don't know,

21:04.119 --> 21:06.204
but all I know is that she's
not your friend right now,

21:06.204 --> 21:07.372
she's a suspect,

21:07.372 --> 21:09.624
and anything you do or say
can jeopardize the case.

21:09.624 --> 21:11.334
And I think it would
probably be better...

21:11.334 --> 21:13.294
if you just threw
everything over to Jones:

21:13.294 --> 21:15.088
Tox, final report.

21:15.088 --> 21:17.632
I think you should
just turn the case over.

21:17.715 --> 21:19.801
When are you and Hagen
going to interview Julie?

21:20.635 --> 21:22.095
I think that it
would be better...

21:22.095 --> 21:25.598
if you didn't know the
particulars of this case anymore.

21:27.183 --> 21:28.351
Okay.

21:30.103 --> 21:31.146
I'm out.

21:49.956 --> 21:51.833
Cadaver dogs are
coming up empty.

21:52.542 --> 21:53.752
What's all this?

21:53.752 --> 21:56.880
These are the ramblings of
a drugged-out tweaker.

22:01.426 --> 22:04.554
Chaz say anything about Darwin
or the missing woman?

22:04.554 --> 22:05.638
No.

22:06.055 --> 22:07.474
No, he didn't.

22:11.102 --> 22:13.271
This one's all
about a "tin man."

22:15.356 --> 22:16.691
Did you say "tin man"?

22:16.775 --> 22:19.110
Yes. Tweaker speak
for meth-heads.

22:19.319 --> 22:21.488
"Friends of Tina,"
"smoking off tin."

22:25.950 --> 22:27.911
This is great intel,
I'll get it to narco.

22:28.203 --> 22:30.663
Right. Burn me a
copy of that, will you?

22:31.998 --> 22:33.083
Sure.

22:33.291 --> 22:34.334
Thanks.

22:44.260 --> 22:45.345
What do we have here?

22:45.345 --> 22:49.057
Shotgun shells,
soldering iron, wire cutters ...

22:49.057 --> 22:52.602
Trademark tools
of bomb-making.

22:57.148 --> 22:58.900
What've you got?

22:59.943 --> 23:01.986
I checked the out-buildings,
no girl nowhere.

23:01.986 --> 23:02.821
Same here.

23:02.821 --> 23:04.280
All we've got to hold him
on is the word of...

23:04.280 --> 23:06.074
that burned-out tweaker,
Tommy Lee.

23:06.991 --> 23:08.993
Did animal control
take the dog?

23:09.744 --> 23:10.870
There was no dog.

23:11.871 --> 23:13.123
What do you mean?

23:13.331 --> 23:14.416
There was no dog.

23:14.541 --> 23:16.626
Empty doghouse.
Let's take a look at this.

23:28.513 --> 23:30.390
Did you hear that, Frank?
Yeah, I did.

23:33.518 --> 23:35.937
Give me a hand with
this, Frank. Yeah.

23:35.937 --> 23:37.147
Give me a hand.

23:37.147 --> 23:38.690
Ready?
Go!

23:44.738 --> 23:45.822
Don't shoot!

23:46.030 --> 23:48.408
Miss, hang on a second.
Miss, hang on.

23:51.244 --> 23:52.579
You're okay.

23:52.579 --> 23:53.872
I got you.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.042
Who put you in there?

23:58.042 --> 23:59.377
I tell you, he'll kill me.

23:59.377 --> 24:00.754
I don't want you to worry
about that right now.

24:00.754 --> 24:02.505
Tell me who
put you in there.

24:12.432 --> 24:13.475
Miss?

24:23.943 --> 24:25.236
Well ...

24:25.236 --> 24:27.530
I guess I know all
about you, too, huh?

24:43.211 --> 24:45.297
It must have been scary
down in that hole, huh?

24:46.131 --> 24:49.134
When I was underground,
I wasn't worried I'd die,

24:49.134 --> 24:52.053
I was worried I'd die
without doing meth again.

24:52.470 --> 24:54.222
How long you been
a friend of Tina?

24:58.226 --> 24:59.394
Couple of years.

25:02.314 --> 25:03.773
Couple hundred years.

25:08.320 --> 25:10.196
I used to be beautiful.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.616
You still are, Susie.

25:15.744 --> 25:17.662
You know, it's so weird.
You ...

25:19.122 --> 25:23.168
you look like this guy used
to get cranked with Chaz.

25:23.168 --> 25:24.586
Real meth freak.

25:25.837 --> 25:26.922
Tin man.

25:30.800 --> 25:33.845
I'm going to need you to
testify against Chaz...

25:33.845 --> 25:35.805
for what he did to you
and Darwin.

25:36.431 --> 25:38.433
It's one thing to say he
shoved me in a box,

25:38.433 --> 25:40.435
but diming him out
for an actual murder ...

25:40.435 --> 25:42.354
What would it take
to make that happen?

25:44.231 --> 25:46.066
Move my probation to Indiana.

25:46.983 --> 25:48.193
Get me a job there.

25:48.193 --> 25:49.319
Maybe I can ...

25:50.362 --> 25:52.113
kick this.
Okay.

25:52.113 --> 25:53.657
Let me look into that.

25:54.491 --> 25:56.284
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

26:00.205 --> 26:02.040
Uh ...
me ...

26:02.457 --> 26:06.628
Chaz, Darwin and Tommy Lee,
we'd been, uh ...

26:11.216 --> 26:14.177
snorting crank for, like,
five days straight.

26:15.220 --> 26:17.973
I was so tired,
like LSD awake.

26:17.973 --> 26:19.224
Chaz was ...

26:20.684 --> 26:22.727
writing songs on his guitar.

26:24.604 --> 26:27.232
I was making my
matchstick houses.

26:27.566 --> 26:30.527
You have to make sure that you
line up all the matches...

26:30.527 --> 26:35.407
perfectly straight, so that
they're, they're perfectly ...

26:48.753 --> 26:52.716
And Chaz just started tripping,
yelling at Darwin.

26:52.716 --> 26:54.092
About music?
Yeah.

26:54.926 --> 26:57.637
Grabbed my cue,
started hitting him with it.

27:03.226 --> 27:04.269
No!

27:05.729 --> 27:07.188
Baby. No, you
hit him too hard!

27:07.188 --> 27:08.481
Get off me!

27:09.941 --> 27:12.485
Darwin's head popped
open like a tomato.

27:15.113 --> 27:17.073
And then Chaz started
taping him up.

27:18.116 --> 27:19.159
Help me get him up.

27:29.461 --> 27:30.879
I don't think he's dead.

27:33.465 --> 27:35.550
I ...I froze.

27:37.928 --> 27:40.931
He noticed me,
drug me to his car ...

27:42.390 --> 27:44.768
Let me go!
Get in the trunk.

27:47.270 --> 27:49.356
Drug me to the
dog house ...

27:56.613 --> 27:57.864
And here I am ...

27:59.532 --> 28:01.534
looking at you
looking at me.

28:03.828 --> 28:05.956
I'm going to need you
to swear out a statement.

28:07.832 --> 28:09.209
I'm good at swearing.

28:11.211 --> 28:12.254
Good.

28:19.219 --> 28:21.346
I have made such
a mess of things.

28:21.346 --> 28:23.515
Well, then, help us
put them in order.

28:23.723 --> 28:25.183
Did you plan the
shooting with Brad?

28:25.183 --> 28:26.309
God, no.

28:26.309 --> 28:27.811
He says you gave
him the gun.

28:28.311 --> 28:30.939
A .25 registered
to your husband.

28:31.147 --> 28:35.277
Yes, I did give him
the gun for protection.

28:35.277 --> 28:37.445
He was mugged
working down at the docks.

28:37.445 --> 28:39.114
I was worried about him.

28:42.033 --> 28:44.411
Brad says you asked
him to kill your husband.

28:46.162 --> 28:47.539
He said that?

28:48.582 --> 28:50.166
Said you met at your office,

28:50.709 --> 28:52.168
you gave him new
glasses and he ....

28:52.168 --> 28:54.588
could see for the
first time in his life.

28:54.796 --> 28:58.341
And when he saw you,
he knew he was in love.

28:59.259 --> 29:00.343
He did say that.

29:00.343 --> 29:02.178
He said the same
thing to me.

29:03.221 --> 29:04.306
Look ...

29:05.056 --> 29:06.850
it was just four months.

29:06.850 --> 29:07.893
I ...

29:07.893 --> 29:09.352
I kept trying to end it.

29:09.352 --> 29:12.188
I told him, I told him I could
never be with him.

29:12.188 --> 29:13.273
That ...

29:13.481 --> 29:15.066
well, that if I'd met
him ten years ago,

29:15.066 --> 29:16.651
or in some other life...

29:16.651 --> 29:19.571
where I didn't have a
husband and three children ...

29:21.448 --> 29:25.368
that's ... that's why Brad
thinks I told him to kill Dennis.

29:33.251 --> 29:35.128
Are you arresting me?
No.

29:35.128 --> 29:37.964
A determination won't be
made until all the evidence is in.

29:42.469 --> 29:44.095
Well, this has got to
be Chaz's car.

29:44.095 --> 29:45.055
Patrol found it.

29:45.055 --> 29:46.973
No leaves or debris
on the windshield.

29:46.973 --> 29:48.308
Hasn't been here long.

29:48.308 --> 29:49.434
You want to tow it?

29:49.434 --> 29:51.645
Nah. I think it's easier
to examine it here.

29:56.983 --> 29:59.861
Got one jumbo-sized
bag of beef jerky.

30:01.655 --> 30:03.573
Two disposable cameras.

30:04.824 --> 30:06.493
More pictures.
More porn.

30:06.493 --> 30:08.578
Won't be taking this
to one-hour photo.

30:15.293 --> 30:17.921
Well, this is definitely
Chaz's duct tape.

30:18.046 --> 30:19.673
Only he cut the
end this time.

30:20.715 --> 30:22.634
Which means you can't
match it to the other sections.

30:22.634 --> 30:23.760
Dead end.

30:23.760 --> 30:25.220
It's pretty smart for
a tweaker.

30:25.220 --> 30:26.304
Maybe not.

30:27.222 --> 30:29.015
I'll see you back
at the lab.

30:29.015 --> 30:30.141
Seniority?

30:30.141 --> 30:31.184
It's a priority.

30:55.375 --> 30:56.585
Tell me something
good, Speed.

30:57.002 --> 30:59.212
Well, the roll of tape
we recovered...

30:59.212 --> 31:01.673
from Chaz's car was cut,

31:01.673 --> 31:04.259
so any comparisons
to torn ends was out.

31:04.259 --> 31:06.011
But you went further,
didn't you?

31:06.011 --> 31:07.929
I looked macro,
not micro.

31:08.847 --> 31:11.683
Chaz wrote his name on
the side of the tape.

31:16.688 --> 31:18.440
So as the pieces
were torn ...

31:18.440 --> 31:20.734
there's small amounts
of ink on the edges...

31:20.775 --> 31:24.487
and ink from the torn
sections lines up perfectly.

31:24.487 --> 31:27.699
So it was Chaz's roll that
restrained Darwin, wasn't it?

31:37.167 --> 31:39.544
I want to thank you
for providing a lawyer.

31:39.544 --> 31:41.254
The system
does that, not us.

31:41.254 --> 31:42.130
Don ...

31:42.130 --> 31:43.423
Just to be clear,

31:43.423 --> 31:46.885
this arraignment is for the murder
of Darwin Capshaw only, correct?

31:46.885 --> 31:48.887
We're going to be filing
separate charges...

31:48.887 --> 31:51.139
for the kidnap of the
girl at a later date.

31:51.139 --> 31:52.349
Then the case is over.

31:52.349 --> 31:53.683
No arraignment necessary.

31:53.683 --> 31:55.060
What are you talking about?

31:55.060 --> 31:56.937
We got key evidence
that proves ...

31:56.937 --> 31:58.480
that Chaz
murdered Darwin.

31:58.480 --> 32:01.274
A roll of duct tape with
Chaz's name written on it?

32:01.274 --> 32:02.484
Anyone could have
used that on the victim.

32:02.484 --> 32:03.610
Hang on a second, guys.

32:03.610 --> 32:05.570
There is an eyewitness
to that murder.

32:05.570 --> 32:07.322
Susie Barnam
is a convicted felon.

32:07.322 --> 32:08.615
That is not my point.

32:08.615 --> 32:12.202
Yeah, well, you
better read this note.

32:12.327 --> 32:15.163
It's from Susie Barnam,
your star witness.

32:15.163 --> 32:17.832
"Chaz, I told you I'd get
back at you, you bastard.

32:17.832 --> 32:20.252
I hope you fry in hell.

32:20.377 --> 32:21.169
Susie"

32:21.169 --> 32:23.088
Translation:
Game over.

32:23.713 --> 32:26.841
Murder charge and
Susie's alleged kidnap.

32:28.927 --> 32:30.428
It's been nice, Lieutenant.

32:32.931 --> 32:34.599
She's telling the truth, Don.

32:35.225 --> 32:37.102
Her character's been trouble
for us from the start.

32:37.102 --> 32:38.353
I don't care.
I believe her.

32:38.353 --> 32:40.063
It's over, Horatio.

32:40.063 --> 32:42.357
A judge would kick it,
no jury would buy it.

32:42.357 --> 32:43.775
No, Don ...

32:43.775 --> 32:46.903
you know this guy kills
people for thrills, right?

32:46.903 --> 32:48.530
Bring me proof.

32:49.906 --> 32:53.285
Didn't we have some narco
task force on this Chaz guy?

32:53.285 --> 32:54.953
That operation is classified.
Right, right.

32:54.953 --> 32:58.456
Wasn't your brother
Ray part of that unit?

32:59.499 --> 33:00.834
That was classified.

33:01.126 --> 33:02.836
Not classified anymore.

33:03.670 --> 33:06.923
Bring me proof or
Chaz stays a free man.

33:30.112 --> 33:31.405
Did you see this?

33:32.447 --> 33:35.033
Dennis had cyclopentolate
in his bloodstream,

33:35.033 --> 33:38.787
150 micrograms per mil,
according to the tox report.

33:38.787 --> 33:40.539
Aren't you supposed to
be off this case?

33:40.539 --> 33:42.040
Jones got the report.

33:42.457 --> 33:44.709
Can't help it if I can
read upside down.

33:46.795 --> 33:48.296
See those ingredients?

33:49.548 --> 33:52.259
That's why Dennis's eyes
were dilated at post,

33:52.259 --> 33:53.343
prescription eyedrops.

33:53.343 --> 33:55.178
And who has access
to eyedrops...

33:55.178 --> 33:58.515
and who is an eye doctor at
Coral Gables professional building?

33:58.515 --> 33:59.808
Your friend Julie.

34:00.016 --> 34:01.643
I'll talk to Hagen about it.

34:04.771 --> 34:05.772
You're not even going
to ask me...

34:05.772 --> 34:07.816
why she'd slip
Dennis eyedrops?

34:08.650 --> 34:09.818
I'm a lawyer's daughter.

34:09.818 --> 34:12.195
I don't ask a question
that I have the answer to.

34:16.408 --> 34:18.493
Julie, do you have any idea
how your husband...

34:18.493 --> 34:20.328
came in possession of
this eyedrop solution?

34:20.328 --> 34:23.331
I prescribed it for him
a couple months ago.

34:23.456 --> 34:24.206
Why?

34:24.206 --> 34:25.708
He was getting migraines.

34:25.708 --> 34:26.918
They're not designed for that,

34:26.918 --> 34:29.004
but they help
de-constrict arteries.

34:34.885 --> 34:38.054
Mrs.Harmon, what is the
prescribed use of these drops?

34:38.346 --> 34:39.639
To dilate the pupils...

34:39.639 --> 34:42.641
so a physician can get a better
look at the ocular muscle.

34:42.976 --> 34:45.103
It also blurs vision,
isn't that right?

34:45.395 --> 34:47.188
That is a side effect, yes.

34:47.188 --> 34:49.315
So it would've made it
impossible for your husband...

34:49.315 --> 34:51.193
to see Brad approach
him with a gun.

34:57.240 --> 34:58.283
Hey, what do you want?

35:03.121 --> 35:06.166
You're saying I slipped
my husband...

35:06.166 --> 35:08.293
the eyedrops before
he left the house?

35:09.878 --> 35:11.421
Did you?

35:12.464 --> 35:13.548
No.

35:13.757 --> 35:16.885
I was taking care of a
sick kid, I told you that.

35:19.513 --> 35:23.058
Dennis must've taken the
drops before he got in the car.

35:27.938 --> 35:29.981
His migraines
came on fast.

35:32.150 --> 35:34.236
He only thought he'd
be gone five minutes.

35:40.534 --> 35:42.035
You don't look convinced.

35:42.035 --> 35:43.036
I, uh ...

35:45.122 --> 35:46.957
I guess it's
time I call a lawyer.

35:46.957 --> 35:48.583
We have a phrase
in law enforcement,

35:48.583 --> 35:50.043
it's called
"equivocal evidence."

35:50.043 --> 35:53.088
It means when you can
interpret the evidence...

35:53.088 --> 35:55.465
both for and against
the suspect equally,

35:55.465 --> 35:56.967
we are obligated...

35:56.967 --> 35:59.428
to give the suspect
the benefit of the doubt.

36:01.304 --> 36:02.723
What happens to Brad?

36:03.765 --> 36:05.100
He's just 22.

36:05.809 --> 36:08.270
We've got his prints,
his confession.

36:08.687 --> 36:10.105
It's murder one.

36:10.105 --> 36:11.857
The state's going
to ask for L-WOP.

36:12.065 --> 36:13.316
"L-WOP"?

36:13.316 --> 36:14.568
Life without parole.

36:15.110 --> 36:17.988
H, just finished  logging
in all the evidence...

36:17.988 --> 36:19.781
from Chaz's vehicle
like you asked.

36:19.781 --> 36:21.366
Okay. Anything from
the bomb debris?

36:21.366 --> 36:23.118
Uh, Speedle's on it.
Nothing so far.

36:23.118 --> 36:24.953
I'm going over to the
photo lab to get the film...

36:24.953 --> 36:26.663
in these disposable
cameras developed.

36:26.663 --> 36:28.874
Wait a second.
What disposable cameras?

36:28.874 --> 36:30.083
From Chaz's car.

36:31.126 --> 36:32.377
Found them on the floor.

36:33.962 --> 36:35.213
Let me see that.

36:36.590 --> 36:37.924
From Chaz's car?

36:41.970 --> 36:43.263
It works.

36:43.597 --> 36:44.639
Smile.

36:44.848 --> 36:46.641
Susie said that she
and Chaz...

36:46.641 --> 36:48.435
were up for five
days at Darwin's,

36:48.435 --> 36:52.355
but by day four, Chaz had
run out of radios to fix.

36:52.355 --> 36:55.859
Now, disposable
cameras like this one,

36:55.859 --> 36:59.196
run off capacitors that
are powered by batteries, right?

36:59.196 --> 37:01.656
But in this case,
our bomber...

37:01.656 --> 37:04.659
placed a nail opposite
the flash button right here.

37:07.496 --> 37:09.790
So when Eric lifted the box,

37:09.790 --> 37:13.085
tension from something
caused a chain of events.

37:13.919 --> 37:15.295
Got some porn.

37:15.712 --> 37:17.756
Let's see how
kinky our guy was.

37:20.675 --> 37:22.636
Allowing the
capacitor to charge.

37:22.636 --> 37:23.762
Right.

37:24.262 --> 37:25.764
So we have a
time delay.

37:25.764 --> 37:26.932
Once fully charged,

37:26.932 --> 37:29.393
the capacitor sent
electricity down ...

37:29.393 --> 37:31.144
the wires to
the blasting cap.

37:34.064 --> 37:35.524
The cap explodes ...

37:36.274 --> 37:39.444
and air is displaced at
16,000 feet per second ...

37:39.444 --> 37:42.155
setting off the
jugs of gasoline.

37:45.617 --> 37:46.993
But how did it get there?

37:52.124 --> 37:54.084
Guitar string
caused the tension.

37:55.127 --> 37:57.629
When I first went onto the scene,
I noticed a guitar.

37:57.629 --> 38:00.257
Yeah, so did I,
against the couch. So?

38:00.257 --> 38:01.925
So it didn't have
any strings.

38:07.305 --> 38:10.559
No, it didn't, but a guitar
string could work, couldn't it?

38:11.268 --> 38:12.853
That would create
the tension.

38:14.438 --> 38:16.982
I guess Chaz is making a
different kind of music.

38:17.315 --> 38:20.527
You guys collected wire
cutters inside his trailer, right?

38:20.736 --> 38:21.611
Yes, we did.

38:21.611 --> 38:24.239
Nice going, Speed.
This is the coup de grace.

38:45.510 --> 38:46.636
...boom.

38:47.262 --> 38:48.597
Got you.

38:49.639 --> 38:51.016
Take a good look
around, Chaz.

38:51.016 --> 38:52.976
This is the last room you're
ever going to be ...

38:52.976 --> 38:54.394
in that has windows.

38:54.394 --> 38:55.771
Susie's a stoner.

38:55.771 --> 38:57.147
Nobody's going to believe her.

38:57.147 --> 39:00.275
We're not charging you with
Darwin's murder, are we, Frank?

39:00.275 --> 39:01.818
We're charging you with
the attempted murder...

39:01.818 --> 39:03.070
of all county employees...

39:03.070 --> 39:04.863
that responded to
Darwin's crime scene.

39:04.863 --> 39:06.406
What attempted murder?
I wasn't even there.

39:06.406 --> 39:07.908
Yeah, but your
explosive was.

39:07.908 --> 39:08.992
Well, who says it's mine?

39:08.992 --> 39:12.037
And so was your guitar
string and your wire cutters.

39:12.037 --> 39:15.332
And so you know,
physical evidence, my friend,

39:15.332 --> 39:17.834
is always better than
an eyewitness.

39:17.834 --> 39:19.419
This is a warrant
for your arrest.

39:19.419 --> 39:22.214
You ask me, Chaz, you're
looking at 15 to 20 years.

39:23.256 --> 39:24.966
What is this,
your consolation prize?

39:24.966 --> 39:26.551
Consolation prize?

39:26.551 --> 39:28.512
Yeah, for the loss
of your brother ...

39:28.512 --> 39:29.638
Tin Man.

39:32.015 --> 39:36.186
Chaz, this is no way
to start your rehabilitation.

39:37.020 --> 39:38.563
Tin man was a dirty cop.

39:39.606 --> 39:42.109
Who do you think taught me
how to make bathtub meth?

39:43.568 --> 39:46.154
Got himself killed before
anyone found out the truth.

39:50.450 --> 39:52.744
Probably went out
squealing like a little girl.

40:00.669 --> 40:01.503
Frank ...

40:01.503 --> 40:05.340
get him out of here
before I soil my reputation.

40:20.939 --> 40:22.482
Police released me.

40:22.482 --> 40:23.984
Yeah, I heard.

40:23.984 --> 40:26.611
Oh, come on,
you know I didn't do it.

40:26.611 --> 40:29.364
Hey, that's between
you and your maker.

40:29.865 --> 40:32.159
Come on, you believe me,
don't you, Lex?

40:35.120 --> 40:36.413
You're smart,

40:36.705 --> 40:39.875
and you always
get what you want.

40:40.917 --> 40:42.419
Get what I want?

40:43.253 --> 40:44.254
Come on.

40:44.254 --> 40:46.173
My husband is dead,

40:46.173 --> 40:49.301
and that young
boy is going to prison.

40:49.301 --> 40:50.719
Get what I want?

40:50.927 --> 40:54.056
And look who's still
alive and fancy-free.

40:56.349 --> 40:58.310
You really think I did it?

40:58.935 --> 41:00.020
No.

41:00.437 --> 41:02.230
You didn't pull the trigger ...

41:03.273 --> 41:05.525
but you are responsible.

41:05.525 --> 41:08.278
Believe me, Julie,
you are responsible.

41:08.278 --> 41:10.739
You don't think I
don't know that?

41:11.031 --> 41:12.866
There's no telling
what you think.

41:12.866 --> 41:15.702
Our families spent every
weekend together,

41:15.911 --> 41:19.122
and you got this whole other
life right under my nose.

41:19.122 --> 41:20.123
And I wanted to tell you,

41:20.123 --> 41:21.750
I wanted to tell you
a thousand times,

41:21.750 --> 41:24.836
but I didn't because I didn't
want to put you guys in the middle.

41:25.670 --> 41:28.006
But you let Denny take
my kids out for ice cream.

41:28.006 --> 41:30.509
Do you know what kind
of danger you put them in?

41:30.717 --> 41:33.345
If that boy had shot
him some other night...

41:33.345 --> 41:34.679
with my kids in the car,

41:34.679 --> 41:36.348
he could've killed them.

41:37.391 --> 41:39.059
He could've killed yours.

41:41.144 --> 41:42.646
Alexx, I ...

41:43.897 --> 41:45.482
I am so sorry.

41:51.113 --> 41:52.322
Can you, uh ...

41:54.741 --> 41:56.159
can you find it ...

41:58.120 --> 41:59.454
can you forgive me?

41:59.788 --> 42:03.625
If it was the other way
around, could you?

42:17.764 --> 42:19.599
Chaz won't find out
where I went, will he?

42:19.599 --> 42:20.434
No.

42:20.434 --> 42:22.728
Only your P.O. and I
will know where you are.

42:23.061 --> 42:24.187
Thanks.

42:24.938 --> 42:26.022
I thought once ...

42:26.022 --> 42:28.442
I couldn't help your court case
against him, you'd burn me.

42:29.192 --> 42:31.486
Well, life is filled with
surprises, isn't it?

42:32.863 --> 42:34.573
Tin man used
to say that.

42:37.701 --> 42:38.994
Did you crank with him?

42:41.079 --> 42:42.122
No.

42:42.664 --> 42:45.792
No, Chaz always thought
we did, but, um...

42:47.919 --> 42:50.714
Isn't that what
narcos do, pretend?

42:52.591 --> 42:53.633
What about you?

42:56.553 --> 42:58.305
I'm not going to lie to you.

43:00.098 --> 43:01.641
Tina's too good.

43:05.520 --> 43:07.355
That stuff will
kill you, Susie.

43:09.858 --> 43:11.735
I'm hoping for
a few more years.

43:16.740 --> 43:17.866
Okay.

43:18.075 --> 43:20.577
I will be here
if you need me.

43:21.620 --> 43:22.704
Thanks.

43:23.121 --> 43:24.164
Okay.

43:29.836 --> 43:30.670
You take care.

43:30.670 --> 43:32.214
Thank you.
All right.

43:34.299 --> 43:35.342
Go ahead.

43:51.149 --> 43:52.692
"Tin man's whack.

43:52.692 --> 43:54.611
Ask all kinds of questions,

43:55.028 --> 43:57.197
going to get himself
killed someday."

43:58.240 --> 44:02.119
"If the crank doesn't first."
