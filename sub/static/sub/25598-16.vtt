WEBVTT

00:01.232 --> 00:03.570
Was this whole thing
designed to get Restoration

00:03.572 --> 00:04.838
back to the table?

00:04.839 --> 00:07.032
It was designed to either
get them back

00:07.033 --> 00:08.899
or to take a chance
on an up-and-comer.

00:08.935 --> 00:10.926
Thomas isn't gonna want to be
in business with Simon

00:10.927 --> 00:11.976
when he finds out about this.

00:11.977 --> 00:13.502
And he's not going
to find out about it,

00:13.503 --> 00:14.969
because we're not
gonna tell him.

00:15.004 --> 00:16.737
Get on the ground.
Wallet and phone.

00:16.773 --> 00:18.472
The same thing
that happened to you

00:18.508 --> 00:19.640
happened to me.

00:19.676 --> 00:20.608
The deal you made
was a ploy

00:20.643 --> 00:23.377
to get Restoration Hardware
to the table.

00:23.413 --> 00:24.924
- You know.
- You're damn right I know.

00:24.948 --> 00:27.648
I'm taking Glen's offer
at the original rate,

00:27.684 --> 00:29.717
and I'm putting out
an announcement about it.

00:29.752 --> 00:31.319
You cannot do what we did.

00:31.354 --> 00:32.920
I'm telling you,
you'll regret it.

00:32.956 --> 00:34.355
You didn't regret it.

00:34.390 --> 00:35.467
You don't know
what happens over time

00:35.491 --> 00:37.091
when you do
something like that.

00:37.126 --> 00:39.827
I'm upset
because I lost a client.

00:39.863 --> 00:41.829
No, you are upset because
I chose Thomas over you.

00:41.865 --> 00:43.364
Louis didn't get
the wrong guy,

00:43.399 --> 00:44.932
and neither did you and I.

00:44.968 --> 00:46.601
It's not about
the wrong man.

00:46.636 --> 00:48.380
It's about taking matters
into your own hands

00:48.404 --> 00:50.004
and what happens
when you do that.

00:50.039 --> 00:52.039
You broke privilege,

00:52.075 --> 00:55.443
and now
I'm gonna make you pay.

- Thomas, hi.
<i>- Hey.</i>

01:10.093 --> 01:11.525
You busy tonight?

01:11.561 --> 01:13.828
<i>Actually, I think</i>
<i>I'm gonna work late.</i>

01:14.964 --> 01:17.465
Donna, you okay?
You sound upset.

01:19.002 --> 01:21.042
I didn't know you were
gonna put out a press release

01:21.070 --> 01:22.637
when you took that other offer.

01:22.672 --> 01:23.704
<i>Donna, the risk you run</i>

01:23.740 --> 01:24.572
when you're known
as a nice guy is,

01:24.607 --> 01:25.985
people think
they can push you around.

01:26.009 --> 01:28.976
I had to show them
that if you push me,

01:29.012 --> 01:31.779
I'm gonna push right back,
and I'm sorry that resulted

01:31.814 --> 01:33.114
in your firm getting fired.

01:33.149 --> 01:34.782
We're not just
getting fired, Thomas.

01:34.817 --> 01:36.150
We're getting sued.

01:36.185 --> 01:39.153
Oh, shit.

01:39.188 --> 01:40.821
Well, no wonder you're upset.

01:40.857 --> 01:43.090
You guys are getting sued
because of me.

01:43.126 --> 01:46.761
Well, that's the thing.
It's not just because of you.

01:46.796 --> 01:49.063
It's because of me.

01:56.139 --> 01:57.838
Robert.

01:57.874 --> 01:58.773
If you're here for a drink,
I'd love to,

01:58.808 --> 02:00.741
but I've already had
a long week,

02:00.777 --> 02:02.576
and Rosalie's expecting me.

02:02.612 --> 02:03.577
I'm not here for a drink.

02:03.613 --> 02:05.046
What's on your mind?

02:05.081 --> 02:06.681
That prison situation

02:06.716 --> 02:08.515
you had
a couple years back.

02:08.550 --> 02:10.584
What about it?

02:10.620 --> 02:12.453
Those men murdered
an innocent man.

02:12.488 --> 02:14.155
You knew about it.

02:14.190 --> 02:15.990
And you didn't do anything.

02:16.025 --> 02:17.458
You here to make me
feel like shit,

02:17.493 --> 02:18.704
or is there a point
in there somewhere?

02:18.728 --> 02:21.495
I'm not judging you, Alex.

02:21.531 --> 02:23.130
I did something
some years back

02:23.166 --> 02:25.099
that I'm not proud of
either.

02:25.134 --> 02:28.836
And I guess I'm wondering...

02:28.871 --> 02:31.605
how do you live with it?

02:31.641 --> 02:33.975
At first, I tried
putting it out of my mind.

02:34.010 --> 02:36.944
But then it kept
popping back up.

02:36.980 --> 02:39.013
Then I thought about
doing something, but...

02:39.048 --> 02:41.482
anything I tried, I'd just
end up in prison myself

02:41.517 --> 02:42.350
for something I didn't do.

02:42.385 --> 02:43.951
Mm.

02:43.987 --> 02:45.987
So I guess the question is,

02:46.022 --> 02:48.189
can you do something
about what you did?

02:48.224 --> 02:50.791
No, I can't.

02:50.827 --> 02:52.638
Then all you can do is try
and make up for it somehow

02:52.662 --> 02:54.528
the rest of your life.

03:02.271 --> 03:04.171
<i>You stuck around and ate</i>
<i>the rest of my Chinese,</i>

03:04.207 --> 03:04.972
didn't you?

03:05.008 --> 03:06.051
You think Laura's
gonna let me

03:06.075 --> 03:08.209
get egg rolls
and fried rice at home?

03:09.779 --> 03:10.923
<i>Look, I wanted to thank you</i>
<i>for staying late.</i>

03:10.947 --> 03:12.313
<i>It means a lot.</i>

03:12.348 --> 03:13.348
Don't mention it, Robert.

03:13.383 --> 03:15.649
Whatever you need, I'm here.

03:15.685 --> 03:16.517
<i>You know that.</i>

03:16.552 --> 03:17.351
I know this
sweet and sour chicken

03:17.387 --> 03:18.886
isn't gonna eat itself.

03:18.921 --> 03:20.821
No, it won't--

03:20.857 --> 03:21.822
Oh!

03:23.026 --> 03:24.725
Samantha, you still there?

03:27.096 --> 03:28.596
Robert, call 911!

03:28.631 --> 03:29.764
Samantha!

03:29.799 --> 03:31.665
I'm at--

Samantha, talk to me.

Harvey.
What are you doing here?

04:17.151 --> 04:18.517
We have a problem.

04:18.553 --> 04:20.252
Come in.

04:23.558 --> 04:25.424
What is it?

04:25.460 --> 04:27.026
Long story short,

04:27.061 --> 04:30.096
Simon Lowe tried to
screw over Thomas Kessler.

04:30.131 --> 04:31.909
You mean that lease deal
that came across my desk

04:31.933 --> 04:33.477
was bullshit?
- Yes, that's what I mean.

04:33.501 --> 04:34.645
Well, Harvey, I know Thomas
is one of my oldest clients,

04:34.669 --> 04:35.868
but you can't tell him.

04:35.903 --> 04:39.305
We're way past that, Louis.
Donna told him.

04:39.340 --> 04:40.940
What?
How could she even know?

04:40.975 --> 04:42.308
Because I told her.

04:42.343 --> 04:43.609
Why the hell
would you do that?

04:43.644 --> 04:45.055
Because she knew
something was wrong,

04:45.079 --> 04:46.223
and I didn't know
what else to do.

04:46.247 --> 04:49.215
I told her to give me
some time so I could fix it.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.384
But before I could,
she told him.

04:51.419 --> 04:54.253
Then Thomas bailed, and Simon
suspected what happened.

04:54.288 --> 04:56.055
Let me guess.
He fired us.

04:56.090 --> 04:58.057
He didn't just fire us,
Louis.

04:58.092 --> 05:00.960
He hired Daniel Hardman
to sue us.

05:04.265 --> 05:05.998
Say that again.

05:06.034 --> 05:08.134
- Simon hired--
- No, tell me again

05:08.169 --> 05:11.070
that Donna put her
goddamn relationship above us

05:11.105 --> 05:14.440
and now Daniel fucking Hardman
is suing my firm.

05:14.475 --> 05:16.075
You want to get
pissed off at Donna,

05:16.110 --> 05:17.410
or you want
to figure this out?

05:19.447 --> 05:21.280
I want to figure this out.

05:21.315 --> 05:23.082
And I sure as shit know
you didn't come here

05:23.117 --> 05:25.084
without a plan,
so what do you have?

05:25.119 --> 05:27.286
As I see it,
we have two options,

05:27.321 --> 05:29.288
the first of which
involves going to Robert.

05:29.323 --> 05:30.289
Pass.

05:30.324 --> 05:31.435
Look, he's the only one of us

05:31.459 --> 05:33.092
that actually
gets along with Hardman.

05:33.127 --> 05:33.893
It's the only chance
we have

05:33.928 --> 05:35.005
of getting him
to be reasonable.

05:35.029 --> 05:36.062
And you and I both know

05:36.097 --> 05:38.631
that there isn't a frozen
dick's chance in hell

05:38.666 --> 05:42.101
that that <i>rat</i>
is gonna be reasonable.

05:42.136 --> 05:44.970
Then tomorrow morning,
you and I need to go in there

05:45.006 --> 05:46.072
with an offer so good,

05:46.107 --> 05:48.474
Simon has no choice
but to take it

05:48.509 --> 05:52.611
and Daniel's left with nothing
but a frozen dick in his hand.

06:12.934 --> 06:15.501
Robert,
what are you doing here?

06:15.536 --> 06:19.305
I came as soon as I found out
where they took you.

06:19.340 --> 06:22.408
- My purse, it had--
- Don't worry about it.

06:22.443 --> 06:26.145
The important thing is,
you're here.

06:26.180 --> 06:30.182
I am so sorry, Samantha.

06:30.218 --> 06:32.218
I never should have
kept you so late.

06:32.253 --> 06:34.520
It's not your fault,
Robert.

06:34.555 --> 06:36.689
If anything, I should have
had my guard up.

06:36.724 --> 06:37.756
This isn't on you.

06:37.792 --> 06:41.026
This is on that piece of shit
who did this to you.

06:41.062 --> 06:42.328
You're right.

06:42.363 --> 06:44.263
We need to get
to the police station.

06:44.298 --> 06:46.176
- I want to make a statement.
- You can do that tomorrow.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.178
- Right now, you need to rest.
- No. If they have any chance

06:48.202 --> 06:50.269
of catching this guy,
the first 24 hours--

06:50.304 --> 06:52.037
Samantha,
whatever we have to do

06:52.073 --> 06:53.617
to make this right, I'm gonna
be right there with you.

06:53.641 --> 06:57.176
But tonight, you're staying put
and getting better.

06:58.579 --> 07:00.079
Okay.

07:04.118 --> 07:06.652
Thanks for being here,
Robert.

07:06.687 --> 07:10.789
I'll always
be here for you, Samantha.

07:12.894 --> 07:16.228
Robert.
You need something?

07:16.264 --> 07:19.198
Yeah. You hear about this
Hardman-Pierpont Malls thing?

07:19.233 --> 07:21.400
I did.
Alex told me.

07:21.435 --> 07:23.369
- What did he say?
- He said he wasn't too happy

07:23.404 --> 07:25.738
with Donna making him look
like shit with his own client.

07:25.773 --> 07:27.706
Mm. Can't blame the man
for that.

07:27.742 --> 07:29.508
No. You can't.

07:31.846 --> 07:33.546
Robert, are you okay?

07:33.581 --> 07:35.548
Because ever since
that thing with Louis--

07:35.583 --> 07:37.616
I'm fine, Samantha.
Do me a favor.

07:37.652 --> 07:39.652
Get to know everything
there is to know

07:39.687 --> 07:41.487
about this whole
Hardman situation.

07:41.522 --> 07:44.156
You never know how
it's gonna shake out.

07:50.431 --> 07:54.166
Harvey, Louis,
good of both of you to come.

07:54.202 --> 07:55.913
- Can I offer you a beverage?
- Oh, actually, yeah.

07:55.937 --> 07:57.570
because this thing's
ending right now.

07:57.605 --> 07:59.738
- What is that?
- We're doubling the money

07:59.774 --> 08:01.907
that you lost
when Kessler backed out.

08:01.943 --> 08:03.742
This says that Kessler
found out about

08:03.778 --> 08:06.378
the Restoration deal
because of a clerical error.

08:06.414 --> 08:08.447
That's right.
Information was included

08:08.482 --> 08:10.649
on certain deal memos
that were just--

08:10.685 --> 08:12.651
Bullshit!
You told Alex Williams.

08:12.687 --> 08:14.598
And a clerical error isn't
gonna cut it with his board.

08:14.622 --> 08:15.588
They need a head to roll.

08:15.623 --> 08:16.900
Louis is just too stupid
to understand that.

08:16.924 --> 08:19.525
You arrogant son of a bitch.
You always underestimated me.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.594
And you're
underestimating me,

08:21.629 --> 08:23.207
because if I'd wanted
to settle with you,

08:23.231 --> 08:24.797
I wouldn't have called
Daniel Hardman.

08:24.832 --> 08:26.699
I thought you said
you called him.

08:26.734 --> 08:29.835
Did I? I must have made
a clerical error.

08:29.870 --> 08:30.603
Regardless,

08:30.638 --> 08:33.038
it's Louis' firm now,
not yours.

08:33.073 --> 08:35.774
And, Louis, we go to court,
the world's gonna discover

08:35.809 --> 08:37.208
that your firm
can't be trusted,

08:37.245 --> 08:39.745
and then you will be
the king of nothing.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.947
But if you admit
that Harvey broke privilege,

08:41.982 --> 08:43.716
this can all go away.

08:43.751 --> 08:44.950
I see what this is.

08:44.986 --> 08:47.820
You want to use that admission
to come after Harvey's license.

08:49.390 --> 08:50.589
Look at that.

08:50.625 --> 08:53.459
I didn't think you had it
in you to figure it out.

08:53.494 --> 08:55.894
Let me tell you something
that you will never figure out.

08:55.930 --> 08:58.530
Leaders never betray
their partners.

08:58.566 --> 09:00.299
Let's save
the betrayal talk

09:00.334 --> 09:02.701
for Harvey's ethics hearing,
shall we?

09:02.737 --> 09:03.747
I imagine I can win
this lawsuit

09:03.771 --> 09:05.704
and have it scheduled
by the end of the month.

09:05.740 --> 09:06.872
You do this,
I promise you,

09:06.907 --> 09:08.018
I'll be the biggest regret
of your life.

09:08.042 --> 09:09.608
No, Harvey.
My biggest regret is,

09:09.644 --> 09:12.811
I wasn't the one to rip
Jessica's name off the wall,

09:12.847 --> 09:16.181
so I'll just have to settle
for ripping yours off instead.

09:17.285 --> 09:18.417
Good day,

09:18.452 --> 09:20.519
gentlemen.

09:20.554 --> 09:22.721
Harvey, how did it go
with Hardman?

09:22.757 --> 09:24.223
It didn't.

09:24.258 --> 09:25.391
What does that mean?

09:25.426 --> 09:26.992
It means he's not
just suing us.

09:27.028 --> 09:28.238
He's trying to get
a guilty verdict

09:28.262 --> 09:30.496
so he can use it
and come after my license.

09:30.531 --> 09:31.397
What?

09:31.432 --> 09:33.499
- No, he can't do that!
- He can, Donna,

09:33.534 --> 09:35.701
because I broke privilege,
and he knows it.

09:35.736 --> 09:37.269
But you didn't
break privilege.

09:37.305 --> 09:38.737
I'm the one
who told Thomas.

09:38.773 --> 09:39.605
And I'm the one
who told Alex,

09:39.640 --> 09:40.884
and that's how they think
Thomas knows.

09:40.908 --> 09:41.674
So what are we gonna do?

09:41.709 --> 09:44.343
<i>We</i> aren't doing anything.

09:44.378 --> 09:46.211
Louis and I
are handling this.

09:46.247 --> 09:48.213
But if I told them
that it was me and not you--

09:48.249 --> 09:49.214
You'd just make it worse.

09:49.250 --> 09:51.350
We told them
it was a clerical error,

09:51.385 --> 09:53.852
and you'd be proving we did
what they're accusing us of.

09:53.888 --> 09:55.621
Harvey, I'm responsible
for this.

09:55.656 --> 09:57.523
I want to help.

09:57.558 --> 09:58.957
I'm sorry, Donna, but--

09:58.993 --> 10:00.693
I get it.

10:00.728 --> 10:01.805
If I really wanted to help,

10:01.829 --> 10:03.962
I never would have told Thomas
in the first place.

10:03.998 --> 10:06.532
Well, I was gonna say
the genie's out of the bottle.

10:06.567 --> 10:07.666
We can't put it back in.

10:07.702 --> 10:10.736
But what you can do is let
Louis and I do what we have to

10:10.771 --> 10:12.738
to get us out of this.

10:14.675 --> 10:16.675
Samantha,
how are you doing?

10:16.711 --> 10:17.543
Physically, I'm fine.

10:17.578 --> 10:19.712
Mentally,
I am pissed the fuck off.

10:19.747 --> 10:20.546
You want to talk about it?

10:20.581 --> 10:21.825
Because we can get you
some counseling.

10:21.849 --> 10:22.815
This isn't about
my feelings, Robert.

10:22.850 --> 10:25.718
I got mugged like 30 other
people that night.

10:25.753 --> 10:27.553
The police aren't gonna
do anything about it,

10:27.588 --> 10:28.320
and you know it.

10:28.356 --> 10:29.388
What are you getting at?

10:29.423 --> 10:31.323
I want the name
of your investigator

10:31.359 --> 10:33.225
and a few days off
to handle this.

10:33.260 --> 10:35.561
You think I'm gonna let you
track down this guy yourself?

10:35.596 --> 10:37.529
- Listen to me--
- No.

10:37.565 --> 10:39.398
Let's say you find him.
What happens then?

10:39.433 --> 10:41.600
You hear of
an eye for an eye?

10:41.635 --> 10:43.469
That's what happens.

10:43.504 --> 10:46.405
Look, if someone attacks you,
they attack me.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.441
So we're gonna go to my guy
and find this son of a bitch.

10:49.477 --> 10:51.844
But when we do,
we turn him over to the DA

10:51.879 --> 10:53.278
and let them do
what they do.

10:53.314 --> 10:54.246
No, that won't work!

10:54.281 --> 10:56.582
I'm not asking, Samantha.
I'm telling.

10:56.617 --> 10:58.584
If you want justice,
you're gonna get it.

10:58.619 --> 11:00.886
That's the only way
this happens.

11:01.989 --> 11:04.656
Okay.

11:04.692 --> 11:06.458
We'll do it your way.

11:06.494 --> 11:08.660
Just give me the name
of your investigator.

11:12.466 --> 11:15.267
Harvey.
What an unpleasant surprise.

11:15.302 --> 11:18.003
Well, it's about to get
more unpleasant,

11:18.038 --> 11:19.878
because I got to thinking:
if Simon was willing

11:19.907 --> 11:21.607
to double deal
behind Thomas' back,

11:21.642 --> 11:23.909
what's to stop him from
doing it with someone else?

11:25.579 --> 11:27.780
That is evidence
of an off-the-books meeting

11:27.815 --> 11:30.949
between two of the largest
mall owners in America,

11:30.985 --> 11:33.452
divvying up retailers
and colluding on rents.

11:33.487 --> 11:36.054
So I'm giving you
a one-time opportunity

11:36.090 --> 11:38.924
to save Simon an investigation.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.959
Well, Harvey, you're right.

11:40.995 --> 11:42.795
Simon did get into a room
with Westhaven,

11:42.830 --> 11:43.996
and it was off the books.

11:44.031 --> 11:45.564
But they weren't colluding.

11:45.599 --> 11:47.310
- They were discussing a merger.
- Bullshit.

11:47.334 --> 11:48.634
I represented him.

11:48.669 --> 11:50.369
He never said anything
about this.

11:50.404 --> 11:52.504
I'd be happy to show you
the offer we made to them.

11:52.540 --> 11:54.573
And I assure you,
they have a copy

11:54.608 --> 11:55.608
in their files right now.

11:55.643 --> 11:57.387
Because you went back
and created a paper trail.

11:57.411 --> 11:58.555
Which means
all you have on Simon

11:58.579 --> 12:01.647
are a couple of dates
on a calendar.

12:01.682 --> 12:03.727
And all you have on me
is conjecture about what I may

12:03.751 --> 12:05.551
or may not have done.
- No, Harvey.

12:05.586 --> 12:07.653
I have a phone call you made
to Travis Tanner

12:07.688 --> 12:10.389
the night before
Restoration backed out.

12:10.424 --> 12:12.558
Turns out, Travis just happens
to represent

12:12.593 --> 12:14.259
the competitor of Simon's

12:14.295 --> 12:15.994
that was drawing up an offer
to Restoration

12:16.030 --> 12:17.930
when Kessler backed out.

12:17.965 --> 12:20.599
Do you think Tanner
will protect you

12:20.634 --> 12:21.533
when I get him on the stand?

12:21.569 --> 12:22.935
You son of a bitch.

12:22.970 --> 12:24.136
Now, now.

12:24.171 --> 12:26.738
Name-calling
won't get us anywhere.

12:26.774 --> 12:28.507
Or maybe it will.

12:28.542 --> 12:30.943
Because I'm willing
to drop this whole thing

12:30.978 --> 12:32.845
if you will do me
the simple courtesy

12:32.880 --> 12:35.414
of putting my name
back up on your wall.

12:35.449 --> 12:38.417
You would have to resign,
of course.

12:38.452 --> 12:41.954
But at least you'd be able
to slink away

12:41.989 --> 12:44.022
and start up somewhere else,

12:44.058 --> 12:45.891
like you did to me.

12:45.926 --> 12:47.459
You really think I'm gonna

12:47.495 --> 12:48.538
let you get away with this,
don't you?

12:48.562 --> 12:51.530
I think you did
what I'm accusing you of,

12:51.565 --> 12:54.066
and the chickens
are coming home to roost.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.413
Are you up to speed
on Hardman?

13:01.449 --> 13:03.615
I am.

13:03.651 --> 13:05.384
Robert, he's not
gonna give up,

13:05.419 --> 13:07.386
and if this thing plays out
the way it's headed--

13:07.421 --> 13:10.489
I know. That's why
I came up with this.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.860
- Are you crazy?
- No, I'm not.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.628
But I need you
to make that happen.

13:16.664 --> 13:17.808
Well, then think
of something else,

13:17.832 --> 13:19.876
because I'll never be able
to convince him to do this.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.467
Samantha, you have
convinced people

13:21.502 --> 13:22.712
of a hell of a lot more
than this.

13:22.736 --> 13:24.781
Because I could get to them.
He won't even take my call.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.772
Well, he's sure as shit
not gonna take mine.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.540
And you can use
his hatred of me to--

13:28.576 --> 13:29.541
You, me--it won't make
a difference.

13:29.577 --> 13:31.610
- He hates us both.
- And if we don't do this--

13:31.645 --> 13:32.823
I know what's at stake,
Robert.

13:32.847 --> 13:34.646
Then I need you
to get this done.

13:34.682 --> 13:37.683
Because I agree--
if this thing plays out

13:37.718 --> 13:39.785
the way that it's headed...

13:41.622 --> 13:43.388
All right.

13:43.424 --> 13:45.424
I'll make it happen.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.963
Louis.

13:54.468 --> 13:56.546
This is only the second time
you've ever come to my home.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.403
First time I was here,

13:58.439 --> 14:00.405
I told you that I got you
out of a jam.

14:00.441 --> 14:02.841
This time, I'm asking you
to get me out of one.

14:02.877 --> 14:04.788
If you're talking about
Simon Lowe suing your firm,

14:04.812 --> 14:06.612
I heard about that,
and I'm sorry.

14:06.647 --> 14:08.747
Well, he's not just
suing the firm, Thomas.

14:08.782 --> 14:10.082
His lawyer's using the suit

14:10.117 --> 14:11.428
to come after
my partner's license.

14:11.452 --> 14:14.686
- You mean Harvey Specter.
- Yes, I do.

14:14.722 --> 14:17.489
So as your first lawyer
and your friend,

14:17.525 --> 14:19.591
I'm asking you to help me.

14:19.627 --> 14:21.360
Help you how?

14:21.395 --> 14:22.439
Simon's lawyer
is trying to prove

14:22.463 --> 14:23.729
that Harvey broke privilege,

14:23.764 --> 14:24.630
and the only people
they can go after

14:24.665 --> 14:27.299
are Harvey, Alex, Donna...

14:27.334 --> 14:28.834
- And me.
- That's right.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.480
And Daniel Hardman
has not subpoenaed you yet,

14:30.504 --> 14:31.648
but it's only
a matter of time.

14:31.672 --> 14:33.772
And you want me to what?
Leave town?

14:33.807 --> 14:35.474
- Or worse yet--
- No, Thomas--

14:35.509 --> 14:37.442
No, no, I don't
believe this, Louis.

14:37.478 --> 14:39.912
The guy helped Simon Lowe
try to screw me over,

14:39.947 --> 14:41.024
and you want me
to cover for him.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.282
Thomas, listen to me.
I know you value honesty,

14:43.317 --> 14:44.983
so I'm gonna be
perfectly honest with you.

14:45.019 --> 14:46.518
Simon was a bigger client.

14:46.554 --> 14:47.998
And Harvey should have
sided with him,

14:48.022 --> 14:50.489
but he tried
to protect you anyway.

14:50.524 --> 14:51.456
And if you don't
cover for him,

14:51.492 --> 14:54.526
all it's gonna do
is take down a good man

14:54.562 --> 14:56.495
who <i>I</i> care about.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.731
I'm sorry, Louis.

14:59.767 --> 15:02.000
If this Daniel Hardman
subpoenas me,

15:02.036 --> 15:03.969
I won't perjure myself.

15:08.876 --> 15:11.143
I assume you're here
to discuss my pending action

15:11.178 --> 15:13.011
against your firm.
- I am.

15:13.047 --> 15:16.748
I'm also here to drink
this 30-year scotch

15:16.784 --> 15:18.917
with an old friend.

15:18.953 --> 15:20.519
I appreciate that, Robert.

15:20.554 --> 15:21.587
But what's the saying?

15:21.622 --> 15:23.755
Never trust Greeks
bearing gifts?

15:23.791 --> 15:24.656
I look Greek to you?

15:24.692 --> 15:25.490
You look like a man

15:25.526 --> 15:27.693
who's trying to have it
both ways.

15:27.728 --> 15:29.105
And you look like one
who's letting a vendetta

15:29.129 --> 15:30.996
cloud his judgment.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.698
They took my firm, Robert.

15:32.733 --> 15:34.399
It's not a judgment.
That's a fact.

15:34.435 --> 15:36.012
And from what I recall,
you all but handed it to them

15:36.036 --> 15:37.102
with your indiscretions.

15:37.137 --> 15:37.970
And if you're here
to litigate the past--

15:38.005 --> 15:40.439
- Fuck the past, Daniel.

15:40.474 --> 15:41.674
I'm here to work
something out.

15:41.709 --> 15:44.042
What will it take
for you to drop this thing?

15:44.078 --> 15:46.578
I said what it would take:
my old firm back

15:46.614 --> 15:48.580
and Harvey Specter's
resignation.

15:48.616 --> 15:50.549
Now, you know
I can't do that.

15:50.584 --> 15:51.850
Why not?

15:51.885 --> 15:54.186
Because Rachel married
his protégé?

15:54.221 --> 15:57.556
Because you and Jessica broke
the glass ceiling together?

15:57.591 --> 15:59.124
We were friends
before any of that.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.926
We talked about starting
a firm together.

16:00.961 --> 16:01.793
I know that we did.

16:01.829 --> 16:04.062
Then why are you
siding with them?

16:04.098 --> 16:06.798
They stole <i>everything</i>
I built, Robert,

16:06.834 --> 16:08.467
forced me out in disgrace,

16:08.502 --> 16:10.535
and I have been in
the wilderness ever since.

16:10.571 --> 16:13.205
And until my name
is up on that wall,

16:13.240 --> 16:15.540
I'm not dropping this.

16:19.113 --> 16:22.047
Then what if I can get
your name up somewhere else?

16:22.082 --> 16:24.082
You mean Rand Kaldor.

16:24.118 --> 16:26.918
Ever since I left the firm,
they've been one man down.

16:26.954 --> 16:28.587
You could come in and--and--

16:28.622 --> 16:30.055
And what?

16:30.090 --> 16:31.957
They hate you
as much as I hate Harvey.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.592
Why would they throw you
a lifeline?

16:33.627 --> 16:36.094
Because you're
Daniel goddamn Hardman,

16:36.130 --> 16:37.496
that's why.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.068
Okay, Robert.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.170
You get Eric and Ellen
to go in on this,

16:45.205 --> 16:46.972
I will let this go.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.775
But if you can't,

16:49.810 --> 16:52.244
our friendship
isn't gonna stop me

16:52.279 --> 16:54.613
from taking Harvey down.

17:02.790 --> 17:05.624
So...how'd it go
with Daniel?

17:05.659 --> 17:07.125
It didn't.

17:07.161 --> 17:08.794
What do you mean,
it didn't?

17:08.829 --> 17:11.163
He already backdated
an excuse, and not only that.

17:11.198 --> 17:14.199
He found out I went to Tanner
behind Simon's back.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.867
Wait, you did what?

17:15.903 --> 17:18.270
I was trying to save Thomas'
deal without telling him.

17:18.305 --> 17:19.382
- I had to go to somebody--
- You know what? Never mind.

17:19.406 --> 17:20.372
I don't give a shit.
But what we need to do

17:20.406 --> 17:23.308
is figure something out,
because this is my firm,

17:23.343 --> 17:25.844
and I'm not gonna let that
son of a bitch take it from me.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.779
- Louis--
- Why did you have to tell her?

17:27.815 --> 17:29.181
That's what I don't get.
Why?

17:29.216 --> 17:30.982
He was my client
for 13 years.

17:31.018 --> 17:32.718
I wouldn't have
told her.

17:32.753 --> 17:34.820
Yes, Louis,
you would have.

17:34.855 --> 17:36.321
Last year, you came to me

17:36.356 --> 17:38.156
about putting Sheila
over the firm.

17:38.192 --> 17:40.192
And I told you
as managing partner,

17:40.227 --> 17:41.293
I wouldn't do it,

17:41.328 --> 17:43.995
but as your friend,
I would.

17:44.031 --> 17:46.164
If I had asked you
about telling Donna,

17:46.200 --> 17:48.266
you would have done
the same thing.

17:48.302 --> 17:51.636
You're right.

17:51.672 --> 17:54.172
I would.

17:54.208 --> 17:55.874
God damn it!

17:55.909 --> 17:57.309
What's going on, Louis?

17:57.344 --> 17:59.811
Thomas said
that he wouldn't help us.

17:59.847 --> 18:01.546
You mean
he wouldn't help me.

18:01.582 --> 18:02.859
Yeah, I guess
that's what I mean.

18:02.883 --> 18:06.551
Why couldn't Donna
just wait for you?

18:06.587 --> 18:08.253
I don't know, Louis.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.022
I really don't know.

18:11.058 --> 18:13.158
You think you would have
come through if she had?

18:13.193 --> 18:14.493
Well, I'd like
to think so.

18:14.528 --> 18:17.162
Yeah, well, I do too.

18:17.197 --> 18:20.165
'Cause let's face it, Harvey:
you pretty much always do.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.902
You're right, Louis.
I do.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.937
And right now, I think I can.

18:25.973 --> 18:27.706
What do you got?

18:27.741 --> 18:30.742
They said a head
needs to roll on this.

18:30.778 --> 18:33.011
What if, instead
of one head rolling,

18:33.046 --> 18:34.913
we give them two?

18:38.204 --> 18:39.271
Good. You're here.

18:40.105 --> 18:41.871
I was going over
my testimony

18:41.907 --> 18:44.174
and could use
another set of eyes.

18:46.532 --> 18:49.600
I don't know
how to tell you this.

18:49.635 --> 18:52.002
I talked to Cameron Dennis.

18:52.037 --> 18:54.438
The guy's friends put him
at a different location, and--

18:54.473 --> 18:56.440
Don't you fucking say it.

18:56.475 --> 18:58.342
Samantha, I'm sorry.

18:58.377 --> 19:00.844
I never should have
listened to you.

19:00.880 --> 19:02.679
Look,
I know you're upset--

19:02.715 --> 19:05.015
Save it. I've got
something to take care of.

19:05.050 --> 19:07.384
So what are you gonna do,
hire someone to break his legs?

19:07.419 --> 19:09.019
God damn it, you told me

19:09.054 --> 19:11.388
if we did this right,
there would be justice.

19:11.423 --> 19:12.656
Where is the justice?

19:14.093 --> 19:16.593
That son of a bitch gets off,
you know what that makes me?

19:16.629 --> 19:18.362
A victim.

19:18.397 --> 19:20.764
I am not a victim, Robert!

19:32.678 --> 19:35.112
One of my foster parents
would hit me.

19:39.185 --> 19:42.553
It's why I joined the service,
why I learned self-defense.

19:45.658 --> 19:47.658
I can't be a victim
again, Robert.

19:47.693 --> 19:50.561
I just...can't.

19:52.865 --> 19:54.731
All right, then.

19:54.767 --> 19:57.501
We'll go the other way.

19:57.536 --> 19:59.503
What are you
talking about?

19:59.538 --> 20:01.405
Cameron Dennis said

20:01.440 --> 20:03.574
that if any new evidence
came to light,

20:03.609 --> 20:05.175
he'll prosecute.

20:08.447 --> 20:10.581
Let's get to
doing that, then.

20:10.616 --> 20:12.482
No.

20:12.518 --> 20:15.185
You took a risk once
to get me this firm.

20:15.221 --> 20:20.090
It's time I took a risk...
for you.

20:23.896 --> 20:27.164
God damn it, Ellen, there's
got to be something you'd--

20:28.901 --> 20:31.768
Well, in that case,
go to hell.

20:33.138 --> 20:35.138
Well, how much?

20:35.174 --> 20:37.207
What's the bastard's price?

20:37.243 --> 20:38.709
There is no price, Robert.

20:38.744 --> 20:40.711
He said no amount
of money or clients

20:40.746 --> 20:42.946
would make up for seeing
his firm get torn apart.

20:42.982 --> 20:45.026
But what about Ellen?
You try horse trading with her?

20:45.050 --> 20:47.050
I did, and I struck out
there too.

20:47.086 --> 20:50.354
God damn it, Samantha!
I got Daniel to agree!

20:50.389 --> 20:52.167
He thought I came up
with Rand Kaldor on the fly,

20:52.191 --> 20:53.557
and I sold it to him.

20:53.592 --> 20:54.603
What do you want me to say?

20:54.627 --> 20:57.494
I want you to tell me
exactly what happened.

20:57.529 --> 20:59.129
Because Eric Kaldor
and Ellen Rand

20:59.164 --> 21:00.575
are two of the greediest
people I know.

21:00.599 --> 21:01.832
So if you're trying to tell me

21:01.867 --> 21:03.044
that they're standing
on principle,

21:03.068 --> 21:04.468
I'm calling bullshit!

21:04.503 --> 21:05.547
And it's pretty clear
what happened.

21:05.571 --> 21:06.882
Eric tried to force
something down your throat,

21:06.906 --> 21:10.240
and you let your pride
get in the way--like always.

21:10.276 --> 21:13.644
Robert...
I offered him

21:13.679 --> 21:15.712
half your client list,

21:15.748 --> 21:17.681
a dividend stream
from your equity share,

21:17.716 --> 21:18.982
a no-poaching commitment--

21:19.018 --> 21:19.983
And if the carrot
doesn't work,

21:20.019 --> 21:21.485
you use the goddamn stick.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.352
And threaten him with what?

21:22.388 --> 21:23.921
We took half the firm
from him.

21:23.956 --> 21:25.689
There is nothing left
to take.

21:28.928 --> 21:31.962
I'm sorry, Robert.

21:31.997 --> 21:33.130
I did everything I could.

21:33.165 --> 21:35.098
We're gonna have to find
another way.

21:36.969 --> 21:38.847
Gentlemen, you have
five minutes to make your case.

21:38.871 --> 21:39.881
You don't, this will be
the shortest lunch

21:39.905 --> 21:42.673
in the history of lunches.
- Then I'll get to it.

21:42.708 --> 21:45.175
We offered Simon Lowe
a settlement

21:45.210 --> 21:48.011
no reasonable CEO
would refuse.

21:48.047 --> 21:51.615
So we want to see
if cooler heads can prevail.

21:51.650 --> 21:52.849
This isn't about
cooler heads.

21:52.885 --> 21:56.653
This is about driving a wedge
between me and my CEO,

21:56.689 --> 21:58.633
and that's not gonna happen.
- That's the thing, Elaine.

21:58.657 --> 21:59.957
There's no need
to drive a wedge,

21:59.992 --> 22:01.959
because it already exists.

22:01.994 --> 22:05.128
That is an email chain
between me and Simon

22:05.164 --> 22:06.029
from 18 months ago.

22:06.065 --> 22:07.965
As you can see,
he was looking

22:08.000 --> 22:09.644
to relieve you of your duties
as chairwoman.

22:09.668 --> 22:11.101
I don't know about you,

22:11.136 --> 22:12.380
but if someone did that
to me at my firm,

22:12.404 --> 22:14.805
their ass would be on the
sidewalk ten seconds later.

22:14.840 --> 22:15.806
And if this is true,

22:15.841 --> 22:17.874
why didn't you
bring it to my attention then?

22:17.910 --> 22:18.842
Because unlike Simon,

22:18.877 --> 22:21.812
I'm loyal to the guy
who writes my checks.

22:21.847 --> 22:23.780
There's no two ways
about it, Elaine.

22:23.816 --> 22:24.614
Simon's a threat to you.

22:24.650 --> 22:26.550
Daniel Hardman's
a threat to us.

22:26.585 --> 22:27.595
Do you want to neutralize
those threats,

22:27.619 --> 22:28.485
or do you just want
to sit there eating salad

22:28.520 --> 22:29.853
while they neutralize you?

22:33.993 --> 22:36.259
Gentlemen, I do believe
I'll bring this to the board

22:36.295 --> 22:38.662
and see if
we can't reach a deal.

22:38.697 --> 22:40.308
Just so we're clear,
this settlement doesn't close

22:40.332 --> 22:41.832
if you only let Simon go.

22:41.867 --> 22:43.166
Believe me, Mr. Specter,

22:43.202 --> 22:44.735
when the board hears
about all of this,

22:44.770 --> 22:46.269
you won't have
to worry about Simon

22:46.305 --> 22:48.939
or Daniel Hardman
ever again.

22:48.974 --> 22:51.641
Robert!

22:51.677 --> 22:54.211
Long time, no chat.

22:54.246 --> 22:57.180
To be honest, I wasn't sure
they were gonna let me in.

22:59.151 --> 23:02.819
So I take it this means
you're accepting my offer.

23:02.855 --> 23:06.556
Well...I don't accept
opening bids,

23:06.592 --> 23:08.203
but if you want to tell me
what you need--

23:08.227 --> 23:10.961
God damn it.
She didn't tell you, did she?

23:10.996 --> 23:12.295
- Eric--
- No, don't.

23:12.331 --> 23:13.775
We worked together
20 years, all right?

23:13.799 --> 23:14.998
I know when you're stalling.

23:15.034 --> 23:18.802
Samantha didn't tell you,
and now you're covering for her

23:18.837 --> 23:20.103
like you always do.

23:20.139 --> 23:22.139
All right, she didn't.

23:22.174 --> 23:24.141
So, what, you want to mock me,

23:24.176 --> 23:26.143
or you want to tell me
what it's gonna take?

23:26.178 --> 23:28.678
It's simple, really.

23:28.714 --> 23:31.615
Daniel Hardman's name
for yours.

23:31.650 --> 23:34.117
- Excuse me?
- I said you retire,

23:34.153 --> 23:35.886
I take Daniel on as a partner,

23:35.921 --> 23:38.955
and that is
take it or leave it.

23:40.559 --> 23:42.359
All right.

23:42.394 --> 23:44.161
Let's get to it.

23:44.196 --> 23:45.762
What the ----
is your problem with me?

23:45.798 --> 23:47.197
- My problem?
- Yeah.

23:47.232 --> 23:48.698
Why'd you take my firm
from me?

23:48.734 --> 23:51.802
See, that--that right there!
That's my problem.

23:51.837 --> 23:53.770
All we ever heard
is that it was your firm,

23:53.806 --> 23:55.605
your name, your reputation.

23:55.641 --> 23:56.885
You know, we had
a little something

23:56.909 --> 23:57.741
to do with it as well.

23:57.776 --> 23:59.309
You think
I didn't know that?

23:59.344 --> 24:00.911
You think I never
gave you credit?

24:00.946 --> 24:01.912
I think you never
let us forget

24:01.947 --> 24:04.247
that it was you that got
our names on the wall.

24:04.283 --> 24:06.983
I did put your names
on the wall!

24:07.019 --> 24:09.197
And maybe if you were a little
more focused on the big picture

24:09.221 --> 24:10.987
than getting a pat
on your back--

24:11.023 --> 24:12.133
Well, you never had a problem
giving a pat on the back

24:12.157 --> 24:14.825
to your little protégé.
- Don't you talk about her.

24:14.860 --> 24:15.826
We would have never
gotten this place

24:15.861 --> 24:18.829
if it wasn't for Samantha.
- So you always say.

24:18.864 --> 24:20.363
Although you never
quite say how.

24:20.399 --> 24:22.099
But if I had
to venture a guess--

24:22.134 --> 24:23.733
Not another word, Eric.

24:23.769 --> 24:25.180
If that's how you
really feel about me,

24:25.204 --> 24:27.537
the answer is no!

24:27.573 --> 24:30.040
I'll take my chances
with my friend!

24:30.075 --> 24:33.110
If you're talking about
Ellen, Ellen's not your friend.

24:33.145 --> 24:35.412
I'm talking about
Daniel Hardman.

24:35.447 --> 24:37.914
Mark my words, we'll come
to some accommodation,

24:37.950 --> 24:41.418
and then you and Ellen Rand
can kiss my black ass.

24:47.726 --> 24:49.025
Well, I don't know about you,

24:49.061 --> 24:50.205
but I think we've earned
a drink.

24:50.229 --> 24:51.695
Well, I'd pour you one,
Louis,

24:51.730 --> 24:53.296
but I'm fresh out
of Peachtree Schnapps.

24:53.332 --> 24:54.798
All right,
enough messing around.

24:54.833 --> 24:56.133
What's the big news?

24:56.168 --> 24:57.968
We got the suit dismissed,

24:58.003 --> 25:00.070
and Daniel Hardman
is out of the picture.

25:00.105 --> 25:02.239
- Louis, that's great news.
- I just wish I could see

25:02.274 --> 25:03.874
the look on his face
when he finds out

25:03.909 --> 25:06.042
we got the better of him.
- I hate to break it to you,

25:06.078 --> 25:06.877
but you didn't get
the better of anybody.

25:06.912 --> 25:07.956
Robert, what are you
doing here?

25:07.980 --> 25:09.124
More importantly,
what are you talking about?

25:09.148 --> 25:11.681
I knew what you were
up against,

25:11.717 --> 25:13.283
so I went to Daniel as a friend

25:13.318 --> 25:15.152
and offered him a deal.
- What kind of deal?

25:15.187 --> 25:16.931
I know what kind of deal,
because there's only one thing

25:16.955 --> 25:19.723
that son of a bitch would
trade taking me down for,

25:19.758 --> 25:21.725
and he told me what it is:
his name on our wall.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.160
And I would never
give him that.

25:23.195 --> 25:25.328
It doesn't matter now,
because...

25:25.364 --> 25:27.264
when Daniel heard
that Simon got fired,

25:27.299 --> 25:29.410
he thought I was playing him,
and he pulled the trigger

25:29.434 --> 25:31.401
on an ethics hearing.

25:31.436 --> 25:33.904
What the shit
did you just say?

25:33.939 --> 25:36.239
They set the date, Louis.

25:36.275 --> 25:38.008
When?

25:38.043 --> 25:41.011
- Harvey, before--
- When, Alex?

25:41.046 --> 25:42.512
This says the hearing's
tomorrow.

25:42.548 --> 25:44.014
They're summoning you,
me, Simon,

25:44.049 --> 25:45.360
Thomas, and Donna.
- Which means we have

25:45.384 --> 25:46.995
less than 24 hours
to get our story straight,

25:47.019 --> 25:47.951
convince Thomas
to corroborate it,

25:47.986 --> 25:51.021
and get Donna
the fuck out of town.

25:51.056 --> 25:52.155
It's not gonna work, Louis.

25:52.191 --> 25:53.523
Leave me alone, all of you.

25:53.559 --> 25:55.125
- I need time to think.
- Harvey--

25:55.160 --> 25:57.260
I don't want to talk
about it, Robert.

25:57.296 --> 25:59.863
You know, I don't care
if one day,

25:59.898 --> 26:02.332
they get me on any of
the other shit that I've done,

26:02.367 --> 26:04.334
but to go down for this?

26:04.369 --> 26:05.468
To go down to <i>him?</i>

26:05.504 --> 26:07.103
- Harvey, we can still--
- No, we can't!

26:07.139 --> 26:08.183
Look, he's got me
dead to rights.

26:08.207 --> 26:10.874
Mike was dead to rights.
Look what happened to him.

26:10.909 --> 26:13.276
This isn't a jury.
It's a fucking ethics board.

26:13.312 --> 26:15.212
And I did exactly
what he said I did.

26:15.247 --> 26:16.947
- Harvey--
- Motherfucker!

26:22.254 --> 26:24.387
I said leave me alone.

26:43.111 --> 26:46.513
I know I'm interrupting,
but can I come in?

26:46.549 --> 26:48.082
Why not?

26:48.117 --> 26:50.784
Sitting by myself doesn't seem
to be getting me anywhere.

26:50.820 --> 26:54.755
Well...maybe this will.

26:54.790 --> 26:56.957
Technically...

26:56.993 --> 26:59.593
You did not break privilege
when you told Donna.

26:59.629 --> 27:02.563
In other words, I could
throw Donna under the bus.

27:03.666 --> 27:05.099
I know you won't do it.

27:05.134 --> 27:06.867
But it had to be said.

27:08.638 --> 27:10.871
Then it's been said.

27:11.941 --> 27:14.875
What?

27:14.911 --> 27:16.243
If this were
another firm,

27:16.279 --> 27:18.746
she wouldn't even
still be working here.

27:18.781 --> 27:20.948
You saying
we should fire her?

27:20.983 --> 27:22.261
If you're asking me
as a name partner,

27:22.285 --> 27:24.752
I would say yes.

27:24.787 --> 27:26.754
If you're asking me
as her friend,

27:26.789 --> 27:28.322
I would say...

27:28.357 --> 27:31.926
There's no way in hell I am
ever letting that woman go.

27:31.961 --> 27:33.327
Never thought
in a million years

27:33.362 --> 27:35.107
something like that
could come out of your mouth.

27:35.131 --> 27:39.233
Well, maybe this place
is rubbing off on me.

27:39.268 --> 27:41.835
You are all...crazy.

27:41.871 --> 27:44.171
But...

27:44.206 --> 27:47.241
maybe that's what
I love about it here.

27:56.986 --> 28:00.087
He's gonna lose everything
because of me.

28:00.122 --> 28:03.357
Donna...you never know
how these hearings will go.

28:03.392 --> 28:05.759
You know...
the worst part is,

28:05.795 --> 28:09.330
I don't even know
why I did it anymore.

28:09.365 --> 28:11.765
I didn't sleep that night.
I just lay there wondering,

28:11.801 --> 28:13.600
"What if Harvey
can't get it done?"

28:13.636 --> 28:15.681
And then I would tell myself,
"Well, he always gets it done."

28:15.705 --> 28:18.038
And then it was morning,
and I hadn't heard from him,

28:18.074 --> 28:19.974
and Thomas' business
was at stake, and I just--

28:20.009 --> 28:22.109
Donna, you told him
because you love him.

28:22.144 --> 28:23.811
Love him?

28:23.846 --> 28:25.612
We just started
seeing each other.

28:25.648 --> 28:27.815
I'm not talking
about Thomas.

28:30.186 --> 28:31.885
Third year of law school.

28:31.921 --> 28:35.189
Rosalie went behind my back
about a pro Bono we were doing.

28:35.224 --> 28:37.725
We got in a huge fight,
and it broke us up,

28:37.760 --> 28:38.726
'cause I thought
she betrayed me,

28:38.761 --> 28:41.695
and she thought I thought
I was a better lawyer.

28:41.731 --> 28:44.331
But she didn't betray me, and
I didn't think I was better.

28:44.367 --> 28:47.201
And none of that had anything
to do with it anyway.

28:47.236 --> 28:49.336
What does this
have to do with me?

28:49.372 --> 28:51.839
I was afraid of committing.

28:51.874 --> 28:54.742
Deep down, she knew it,
so she closed the window.

28:54.777 --> 28:56.243
And it made me realize

28:56.278 --> 28:59.179
I didn't like being
on the other side of the glass.

28:59.215 --> 29:03.050
I didn't do what I did to
make Harvey realize anything.

29:03.085 --> 29:04.752
Neither did Rosalie.

29:04.787 --> 29:06.854
She did it
so she could move on.

29:10.726 --> 29:12.326
<i>Thomas, I appreciate you</i>
<i>seeing me</i>

29:12.361 --> 29:13.761
<i>on such short notice.</i>

29:13.796 --> 29:14.661
You said it was about Donna,

29:14.697 --> 29:16.430
so of course I'll see you.

29:16.465 --> 29:19.066
- What's going on?
- It's simple.

29:19.101 --> 29:22.236
Donna was the one
who told you about Simon...

29:22.271 --> 29:24.271
but I want you
to say it was me.

29:24.306 --> 29:26.206
You want me to lie.

29:26.242 --> 29:28.842
Look, I know
you're a man of your word,

29:28.878 --> 29:30.844
but she risked all this
because she knows

29:30.880 --> 29:32.713
how much your business
means to you.

29:32.748 --> 29:34.882
Well, she worked
her entire life

29:34.917 --> 29:37.751
to get to where she is,
and the truth comes out,

29:37.787 --> 29:39.297
she'll be barred
from working in a law firm

29:39.321 --> 29:41.255
for the rest of her life.

29:41.290 --> 29:43.290
What am I not seeing here,
Harvey?

29:43.325 --> 29:44.858
How does all this protect you?

29:44.894 --> 29:46.393
It doesn't.

29:46.429 --> 29:47.961
I just don't see
why she has to stand

29:47.997 --> 29:50.364
in front of
that firing squad too.

29:50.399 --> 29:53.267
All I'm asking you to do

29:53.302 --> 29:55.402
is protect her...

29:55.438 --> 29:57.838
like she protected you.

29:59.241 --> 30:01.475
Oh, no, no, no.

30:01.510 --> 30:04.078
You were the first one
to take an offer.

30:04.113 --> 30:05.979
Yeah, but then you
went to another firm.

30:06.015 --> 30:07.448
Because back then,

30:07.483 --> 30:09.416
they weren't gonna hire
a man like me,

30:09.452 --> 30:10.951
no matter what school
I went to.

30:10.986 --> 30:12.419
I could have got you in.

30:12.455 --> 30:13.987
They hired Jessica.

30:14.023 --> 30:17.124
Years later.
I couldn't wait for that.

30:17.159 --> 30:20.327
I still think we would have
made a great firm.

30:20.362 --> 30:21.562
Zane Hardman.

30:21.597 --> 30:22.741
Wait, why is your name first?

30:22.765 --> 30:24.832
You let Jessica go first.

30:24.867 --> 30:26.934
You let Rand and Kaldor.

30:26.969 --> 30:28.001
Yeah, you're right.

30:28.037 --> 30:30.237
I don't have to go first.
I know where I stand.

30:30.272 --> 30:32.840
Go ahead, take it.
Hardman Zane.

30:32.875 --> 30:34.108
No. I don't want it now.

30:35.044 --> 30:37.077
- Excuse me a moment, Daniel.
- Mm-hmm.

30:42.852 --> 30:43.951
Cameron?

30:43.986 --> 30:46.086
Robert, I have some news,

30:46.122 --> 30:48.422
and I thought
I owed it to you to call.

31:01.036 --> 31:04.037
Please don't tell her.

31:06.308 --> 31:07.207
Robert,
whatever it is,

31:07.243 --> 31:10.777
- I have to testify this morning.
- I know.

31:10.813 --> 31:12.212
Then what is it?

31:12.248 --> 31:13.814
Remember when I said

31:13.849 --> 31:15.983
I couldn't make up
for what I did?

31:16.018 --> 31:17.851
I think I can.

31:17.887 --> 31:18.752
But I'm gonna need your help,

31:18.787 --> 31:22.022
and you might not like
what I need it for.

31:22.057 --> 31:22.956
Well, I know what it's like

31:22.992 --> 31:25.092
to live with a weight
on your shoulders.

31:25.127 --> 31:27.161
And if I can help you
take it off,

31:27.196 --> 31:30.230
why don't you go ahead
and tell me what you need?

31:34.103 --> 31:36.803
- Thomas.
- Can I come in?

31:36.839 --> 31:38.138
Of course.

31:38.174 --> 31:39.484
I was just getting ready
for this morning.

31:39.508 --> 31:41.942
I know. That's what
I wanted to talk about.

31:43.712 --> 31:45.979
Look, if this is about Louis
coming to see you,

31:46.015 --> 31:47.915
if I had known
he was gonna do that--

31:47.950 --> 31:48.916
It's not about Louis
coming to me.

31:48.951 --> 31:52.252
It's, um--it's about
Harvey Specter coming to me.

31:52.288 --> 31:55.222
- Harvey came to you?
- Last night.

31:55.257 --> 31:57.424
- What did he say?
- Well, he pretty much said

31:57.459 --> 31:59.059
that he was about
to lay himself down

31:59.094 --> 32:00.227
on the train tracks for you,

32:00.262 --> 32:04.264
and he wanted me
to help tie him down.

32:04.300 --> 32:06.533
Well...
I-I don't know

32:06.569 --> 32:07.868
exactly what that means--

32:07.903 --> 32:09.369
Who are you to him?

32:11.874 --> 32:13.273
I don't know
how to answer that.

32:13.309 --> 32:15.976
I got it when Louis
came to me.

32:16.011 --> 32:16.977
This comes out,
it hurts his firm.

32:17.012 --> 32:17.778
It hurts his partner.

32:17.813 --> 32:19.346
He wouldn't want
to see that happen.

32:19.381 --> 32:23.016
But then Harvey came to me,
and...

32:23.052 --> 32:25.085
all he seemed
to care about is you.

32:25.120 --> 32:28.855
So if you can't tell me
who you are to him, maybe...

32:28.891 --> 32:33.026
you can tell me
who he is to you.

32:33.062 --> 32:35.162
I don't know
who he is, Thomas.

32:37.600 --> 32:38.743
I just know
that he's somebody

32:38.767 --> 32:42.102
that I can't seem to figure out
how to cut out of me.

32:45.007 --> 32:47.708
But I want to.

32:47.743 --> 32:50.477
And I have wanted to,
and apparently, I tried to

32:50.512 --> 32:52.879
when I told you
what was going on.

32:54.350 --> 32:56.483
But the truth is,
I don't know

32:56.518 --> 32:59.052
if I'll ever be able to.

33:03.992 --> 33:06.794
Thomas Kessler shook my hand
and said yes to a deal.

33:06.829 --> 33:09.263
He had no reason
in the world to back out

33:09.298 --> 33:11.966
until Harvey Specter
gave him one.

33:12.001 --> 33:12.867
When you confronted him
with this allegation,

33:12.902 --> 33:14.168
what did he do?

33:14.203 --> 33:17.104
He paid off my board
and got me fired.

33:17.140 --> 33:18.072
It wasn't a payoff.

33:18.107 --> 33:19.940
It was a settlement
that we offered you first.

33:19.976 --> 33:20.986
Along with a fabricated
explanation

33:21.010 --> 33:23.611
about Kessler finding out
due to a clerical error.

33:23.646 --> 33:26.147
The contents of that offer
are not admissible here.

33:26.182 --> 33:29.316
In other words, you're
preparing to change your story?

33:29.352 --> 33:30.818
As far as I'm concerned,

33:30.853 --> 33:32.653
it's time to get
to the main course.

33:32.688 --> 33:34.255
I call Harvey Specter.

33:35.858 --> 33:37.291
Where is she?

33:37.326 --> 33:39.138
She said she didn't care
if she was summoned or not.

33:39.162 --> 33:40.461
She couldn't watch.

33:40.496 --> 33:42.797
What are you gonna do?

33:42.832 --> 33:44.732
I don't know.

33:44.767 --> 33:46.233
Shortly after Simon Lowe
told you

33:46.269 --> 33:48.235
he was using Thomas Kessler
as a pawn,

33:48.271 --> 33:49.415
Kessler pulled out
of their deal.

33:49.439 --> 33:51.939
- Why was that?
- If you're asking

33:51.974 --> 33:54.942
if I told him about
my client's plans, I didn't.

33:54.977 --> 33:56.710
- Then how did he find out?
- I don't know.

33:56.746 --> 33:58.345
Maybe Restoration
clued him in.

33:58.381 --> 34:00.314
Maybe he overheard someone
at dinner.

34:00.349 --> 34:02.183
Or maybe it was
the clerical error nonsense

34:02.218 --> 34:04.852
you tried to pull before.
- What's nonsense is,

34:04.887 --> 34:07.588
I did not share my client's
privileged information

34:07.623 --> 34:10.157
with another client, yet...

34:10.193 --> 34:11.303
he brought
this complaint anyway,

34:11.327 --> 34:14.094
and he did it because
he knew Pierpont Malls

34:14.130 --> 34:16.630
was about to drop their suit
against my firm

34:16.666 --> 34:17.998
because it had no merit.

34:18.034 --> 34:20.034
They dropped it
because you paid them to.

34:20.069 --> 34:21.869
Mr. Specter,
Mr. Hardman has a point.

34:21.904 --> 34:23.348
I find it hard to believe
that Thomas Kessler

34:23.371 --> 34:25.106
wasn't informed by your office,

34:25.141 --> 34:27.875
so I ask you...
do you stand by your answer?

34:27.909 --> 34:30.945
I stand by the fact that
he has to prove what I did.

34:30.980 --> 34:32.713
I don't have to prove
what I didn't.

34:32.748 --> 34:36.016
Then I say it's time
we ask someone else.

34:37.320 --> 34:40.621
Mr. Williams,
did you or did you not

34:40.656 --> 34:43.324
inform Thomas Kessler
that his firm was being used

34:43.359 --> 34:45.059
as a stalking horse?

34:45.094 --> 34:46.226
No, I did not.

34:46.262 --> 34:47.862
Then is it true

34:47.897 --> 34:50.197
Mr. Kessler knew
he was being used?

34:50.233 --> 34:52.043
I can't speak to what
my client did or didn't know.

34:52.068 --> 34:53.245
Then let's talk
about what you knew.

34:53.268 --> 34:55.069
You got his original landlord

34:55.103 --> 34:56.837
to make him a better offer,
did you not?

34:56.873 --> 34:59.006
Yes, I did. And there's
nothing wrong with using

34:59.041 --> 35:00.719
Pierpont's offer to get
a better deal for my client.

35:00.743 --> 35:01.854
It's what
they were doing to us.

35:01.878 --> 35:03.978
Yes, but the difference is,
when he got the offer,

35:04.013 --> 35:06.213
he turned it down.
Why would he do that?

35:07.850 --> 35:09.750
- Because...
- Because...

35:09.785 --> 35:10.651
what?

35:10.686 --> 35:12.231
Why would a man
turn down a better offer

35:12.255 --> 35:13.665
and then take out an ad
in the "Journal"

35:13.689 --> 35:16.223
pronouncing the value
of integrity

35:16.259 --> 35:17.858
over profits?

35:17.894 --> 35:19.760
It's because he knew

35:19.795 --> 35:22.163
what Simon Lowe was doing,
and you knew he knew.

35:22.198 --> 35:24.098
And I remind you,
I will call Thomas Kessler,

35:24.133 --> 35:25.366
and he will tell me the truth,

35:25.401 --> 35:27.668
because he is a man
of integrity.

35:27.703 --> 35:30.070
All right.
I knew.

35:30.106 --> 35:33.040
And I told my client,
which was my obligation.

35:33.075 --> 35:36.410
Finally. You knew...because
Harvey Specter told you.

35:36.445 --> 35:41.382
No. I knew because
Robert Zane told me.

35:41.417 --> 35:42.761
What?
I can't cover for you anymore.

35:42.785 --> 35:43.795
You're not covering anything.

35:43.819 --> 35:45.186
I had no reason
to break privilege.

35:45.221 --> 35:46.954
Yes, you did.

35:46.989 --> 35:48.100
You saw a way to get back at
Harvey Specter and Louis Litt

35:48.124 --> 35:50.124
for taking you down
as managing partner.

35:50.159 --> 35:51.792
You knew if you
broke privilege,

35:51.827 --> 35:53.205
he would take a hit and you
would take the firm back.

35:53.229 --> 35:54.506
Mr. Chairman,
that is a fabrication.

35:54.530 --> 35:57.298
This is obviously a hit job
on an innocent man.

35:57.333 --> 35:58.265
If he's so innocent,

35:58.301 --> 35:59.378
then why do I have an email
from Robert Zane

35:59.402 --> 36:02.703
informing me of
Simon Lowe's duplicity?

36:03.940 --> 36:06.440
- You're in on this?
- Mr. Zane.

36:06.475 --> 36:08.275
Is this true?

36:11.314 --> 36:12.980
It is.

36:13.015 --> 36:15.382
I can't hide it anymore.

36:15.418 --> 36:17.718
Oh, no.

36:17.753 --> 36:20.154
They orchestrated
this whole thing.

36:20.189 --> 36:21.989
Ask Kessler.

36:22.024 --> 36:23.424
Mr. Kessler, who was it,
Robert Zane

36:23.459 --> 36:25.960
or Harvey Specter?

36:30.099 --> 36:32.166
All I know is that
Alex Williams

36:32.201 --> 36:33.834
informed me
of Pierpont's plan.

36:33.869 --> 36:35.402
I can't speak
to who told him.

36:35.438 --> 36:38.005
No. Travis Tanner admitted

36:38.040 --> 36:40.074
Harvey called him
the night before.

36:40.109 --> 36:41.008
Then why isn't he here?

36:41.043 --> 36:44.178
Obviously
because he got to him!

36:44.213 --> 36:47.114
Robert, as this is
a disbarrable offense,

36:47.149 --> 36:49.183
I ask you again, under oath,

36:49.218 --> 36:51.085
is this email real?

36:51.120 --> 36:52.486
Did you do this?

36:59.070 --> 37:00.070
I did.

37:02.206 --> 37:05.374
Then do you have anything
to say in your defense?

37:05.409 --> 37:08.210
Only that I did
what I felt

37:08.245 --> 37:10.045
was right at the time.

37:10.081 --> 37:12.881
I didn't regret it then.

37:12.917 --> 37:14.883
But I do now.

37:14.919 --> 37:17.653
Robert,
why are you doing this?

37:20.992 --> 37:23.225
I'm making up
for what I did wrong.

37:23.260 --> 37:27.162
Well, I'm sorry to say,
but that's not enough.

37:27.198 --> 37:29.531
You hereby forfeit your
license to practice law.

37:29.567 --> 37:32.067
This matter's now closed.

37:45.883 --> 37:47.383
How could you do it?

37:47.418 --> 37:48.283
- Samantha.
- You've been working

37:48.319 --> 37:49.084
your whole life for this.

37:49.120 --> 37:50.819
How could you just
throw it away?

37:50.855 --> 37:51.620
I didn't throw it away.

37:51.656 --> 37:52.621
That's what I need you
to understand.

37:52.657 --> 37:54.289
Well, I don't understand it.

37:54.325 --> 37:57.826
How could you take the fall
for something you didn't do?

37:57.862 --> 37:58.994
How could you do that to me?

37:59.030 --> 38:00.462
Because I did something else,

38:00.498 --> 38:01.830
and I can't live with it
anymore.

38:01.866 --> 38:03.232
What are you
talking about?

38:03.267 --> 38:06.001
That man that attacked you...

38:06.037 --> 38:07.503
the one that we put away--

38:07.538 --> 38:09.938
That's why you did this?

38:09.974 --> 38:12.274
Robert, he got
what he deserved.

38:12.309 --> 38:15.110
He was killed, Samantha,

38:15.146 --> 38:16.845
murdered in his own cell.

38:16.881 --> 38:19.048
And it's my fault.

38:19.083 --> 38:20.916
Now, he may have been
a piece of shit,

38:20.951 --> 38:22.051
but he was someone's son,

38:22.086 --> 38:25.354
and he wouldn't have been
in there if it weren't for me.

38:25.389 --> 38:27.022
Why didn't you tell me?

38:27.058 --> 38:29.058
Because it wasn't
your burden to bear.

38:29.093 --> 38:31.126
But I am telling you now

38:31.162 --> 38:33.395
because I need you
to understand.

38:35.966 --> 38:38.600
This is redemption for me.

38:38.636 --> 38:41.603
What am I gonna do
without you?

38:41.639 --> 38:43.138
You've got your name
on the wall.

38:43.174 --> 38:46.075
You don't need me
anymore.

38:46.110 --> 38:49.545
The truth is...

38:49.580 --> 38:53.082
you haven't needed me
for a long time.

39:00.357 --> 39:02.324
I don't want
to be alone.

39:02.359 --> 39:05.394
You're not gonna be
alone here.

39:05.429 --> 39:09.431
You've got...
Louis and Donna and Alex.

39:09.467 --> 39:10.899
It's not the same thing.

39:10.935 --> 39:12.301
Ha-ha. You want
to talk the same?

39:12.336 --> 39:14.403
I've seen you
and Harvey together.

39:14.438 --> 39:17.272
You're peas in a pod.

39:17.308 --> 39:20.409
Go to him.
Seek him out.

39:21.512 --> 39:24.179
And who knows?
Over time,

39:24.215 --> 39:28.117
you might even...

39:28.152 --> 39:29.618
Might even what?

39:31.489 --> 39:33.255
Nothing.

39:36.994 --> 39:39.128
Now come over here
and give an old man a hug.

39:53.043 --> 39:54.676
You looking for him too?

39:57.681 --> 40:00.215
I went to call Donna
after the hearing.

40:00.251 --> 40:03.051
She didn't answer,
but when I came back,

40:03.087 --> 40:04.686
all you guys were gone.

40:04.722 --> 40:07.122
There wasn't really
a reason to stay.

40:08.659 --> 40:11.527
Alex, if you'd have told me
you were gonna do that--

40:11.562 --> 40:14.329
That's why Robert
wouldn't let me tell you.

40:15.933 --> 40:17.399
I know I need
to thank him...

40:17.434 --> 40:20.402
- But you need to know why.
- Yeah.

40:20.437 --> 40:22.404
- I do.
- Because, Harvey,

40:22.439 --> 40:24.184
sometimes people
are carrying around a burden

40:24.208 --> 40:27.376
they need to put down that
has nothing to do with you.

40:27.411 --> 40:28.310
What burden?

40:28.345 --> 40:30.179
None of your
goddamn business.

40:30.214 --> 40:32.714
Stop moping around
my office.

40:32.750 --> 40:34.249
I'm retired.

40:34.285 --> 40:36.318
I'm not dead.

40:36.353 --> 40:37.553
And, Harvey...

40:37.588 --> 40:40.255
I knew what I was doing.

40:40.291 --> 40:42.157
I'm good with it.

40:43.694 --> 40:45.694
Well, then if it's
all right with you,

40:45.729 --> 40:48.096
what do you say,
to celebrate your retirement,

40:48.132 --> 40:50.365
I finally take you out
for that burger?

40:50.401 --> 40:52.601
You got it.

40:52.636 --> 40:54.503
But not tonight.

40:54.538 --> 40:57.072
Something like this happens,

40:57.107 --> 41:00.008
makes you know
what's really important.

41:00.044 --> 41:02.511
And for me, it's Laura.

41:05.049 --> 41:07.382
Hey.

41:07.418 --> 41:09.618
You sure you don't want to
tell me what that burden was?

41:09.653 --> 41:12.788
Isn't it enough
I saved your sorry ass?

41:12.823 --> 41:15.591
And by the way,
most people get a gold watch.

41:15.626 --> 41:17.926
I get a goddamn burger.

41:20.297 --> 41:22.231
Why you gotta push it?

41:22.266 --> 41:24.766
Now we gotta get him a watch.

41:24.802 --> 41:26.401
Hey.

41:26.437 --> 41:28.303
u want to get a burger?

41:28.339 --> 41:30.572
Sorry, Harvey.

41:30.608 --> 41:32.441
Robert's right.

41:32.476 --> 41:35.611
I need to get home
to the woman I love.

41:46.690 --> 41:48.757
Shouldn't you be out
celebrating?

41:48.792 --> 41:51.260
You'd think so,
but losing Robert

41:51.295 --> 41:54.162
kind of takes the charm
off the victory.

41:57.201 --> 41:59.134
Listen, Harvey,

41:59.169 --> 42:00.769
I appreciate this,
but...

42:00.804 --> 42:04.072
I don't need you
checking up on me.

42:04.108 --> 42:06.108
Where else
do I have to be?

42:10.114 --> 42:12.781
You know,
I lost my mentor too.

42:12.816 --> 42:15.117
Jessica Pearson.

42:15.152 --> 42:17.486
Robert used to talk
about her all the time.

42:17.521 --> 42:19.554
What was she like?

42:21.558 --> 42:24.526
Let's just say she was to me
what he is to you.

42:24.561 --> 42:27.462
It was hard losing her,
but...

42:27.498 --> 42:29.097
it gets easier.

42:30.534 --> 42:33.635
He believed in me.

42:33.671 --> 42:35.704
He was the only one

42:35.739 --> 42:37.472
who ever did that.

42:37.508 --> 42:40.375
The only one
who saw who I was.

42:40.411 --> 42:43.645
All my baggage,
all my flaws.

42:43.681 --> 42:45.547
And he accepted you
anyway.

42:45.582 --> 42:48.550
He didn't just accept me.

42:48.585 --> 42:50.319
He loved me.

42:50.354 --> 42:53.355
Not easy to find someone
like that in this world.

42:54.692 --> 42:56.458
No, it's not.

42:56.493 --> 42:58.961
I mean, what am I
supposed to do when I have

42:58.996 --> 43:00.295
a big victory
or a terrible loss

43:00.331 --> 43:04.333
and the only person I want
to run and tell isn't there?

43:04.368 --> 43:06.635
What am I supposed to do?

43:08.739 --> 43:11.139
Samantha, I'm so sorry,
but I have to go.

43:11.175 --> 43:13.575
Where?

43:13.610 --> 43:15.911
I just have to.
