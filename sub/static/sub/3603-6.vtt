a right fool sometimes.

is that Costa Verde High

Are you ever
gonna tell me

03:34.632 --> 03:37.999
Where are we?
I mean, you just
grab me off the street...

03:38.094 --> 03:41.006

03:45.601 --> 03:48.343
Not exactly like you.
Others have different gifts.

03:48.437 --> 03:51.349
You're the first we've met
with adoptive muscle memory.

03:51.440 --> 03:55.934
(SCOFFS) So that's what
it's called. Why is this
happening to me?

03:58.030 --> 03:59.236
We're not really sure.

03:59.323 --> 04:03.407
There are certain genetic
markers, but where they come
from is still a mystery.

04:03.494 --> 04:05.655
You have been given
an extraordinary gift.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.077

04:24.723 --> 04:28.762
Have you established

04:28.853 --> 04:32.437
Yes. She is able to
replicate any action. That's
really quite extraordinary.

04:32.523 --> 04:33.638
Good.

04:37.611 --> 04:41.069
Now, we could determine
if this stops all of that.

04:41.157 --> 04:42.112
What is that?

04:42.199 --> 04:43.939
A variant of
the Shanti virus.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.695
You're experimenting
with the virus?

04:45.786 --> 04:50.746
Manipulating a live virus
is essential for creating
a vaccine, Doctor.

04:50.916 --> 04:55.455
We hope to use this virus
to take away Monica's ability
without harming her.

04:55.546 --> 04:56.956
You could create
an incurable strain.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.787
It could cross over
to the general population.

04:58.883 --> 05:02.091
Think how many people
were killed by Gabriel Gray.

05:02.470 --> 05:06.839

in this world that must
be stopped at any cost.

Monica is a sweet girl
who loves her abilities.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.472

them away from her.

05:12.563 --> 05:14.554
It's for the greater good.

05:15.274 --> 05:16.980

05:17.067 --> 05:19.319

to inject her
without her consent?

05:19.403 --> 05:21.394
No, Dr. Suresh. You are.

05:27.036 --> 05:29.698
It's a mutated strain.
Manufactured.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.120
If the biological structure
of the virus has been altered,

05:32.208 --> 05:34.699
I don't know
if I could save her.
She could die.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.499
You're just gonna
have to take
that chance.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.294
I never agreed
to experiment
on people.

05:39.757 --> 05:42.248

Molly, didn't you?

05:43.594 --> 05:44.879
I didn't know
what else to do.

05:44.970 --> 05:48.428
Look, if you refuse
to do this, they're
gonna get rid of you.

05:48.516 --> 05:51.223
And then we're gonna
lose everything that
we've been trying to do,

05:51.310 --> 05:54.017

you're gonna
lose Molly.

Wait.
It's in the warehouse
near the train yard.

33:29.216 --> 33:31.673
Where we tagged
the liquid man.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.092
You'll find
your paintings
there.

33:35.055 --> 33:36.386
Thank you.

33:37.141 --> 33:38.506
Now what?

33:38.601 --> 33:43.015
Your Haitian friend makes
sure that I'll forget
that you were ever here?

33:48.777 --> 33:50.688
I wish it were
that easy.

33:52.281 --> 33:55.364
Once the Company
discovers
your memory loss,

33:55.451 --> 33:58.284
they'll trace it back
to the Haitian
which leads to my family.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.530
And I can't have that.

33:59.622 --> 34:00.953
What are you doing?

34:01.040 --> 34:03.372
You taught me well,
my friend.

34:03.459 --> 34:05.916
You said, "Make it look
as if you were never there."

34:06.003 --> 34:08.335
So now, we weren't.

34:08.672 --> 34:11.505
Instead, there was
a simple home invasion.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.218
A senseless murder...

34:13.302 --> 34:15.384
I'm offering you
a way out.

34:15.596 --> 34:17.552
You can stop running.

34:19.225 --> 34:21.716
Shoot me and
there's no turning back.

34:21.810 --> 34:24.142
You'll condemn
yourself to hell.

34:31.445 --> 34:32.651
I know.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.668
Kensei! I've been
searching for hours!

34:49.755 --> 34:53.088
Come, my friend,
we must go back and
destroy White Beard's guns.

34:53.175 --> 34:56.008
If you want
to stop them,
do it yourself.

34:57.179 --> 34:58.385
Something wrong?

34:58.472 --> 34:59.678
I saw you, Hiro.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.551
After I saved
the swordsmith,
I came after you,

35:01.642 --> 35:05.226
afraid something
had happened to Yaeko,
because I love her!

35:06.355 --> 35:08.937
And you, "friend,"
betrayed me.

35:09.024 --> 35:11.015
No.
Yes. You kissed her.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.271
lthappened
by accident.

35:17.366 --> 35:18.856
You accidentally
kissed her?

35:18.951 --> 35:22.318
I accidentally
fell in love with her.
And she with me.

35:23.414 --> 35:24.403
I am so sorry.

35:24.498 --> 35:26.864
So you've been lying
to me all along.

35:27.710 --> 35:29.666
First you show me
that I can be harmed
by no weapon,

35:29.753 --> 35:33.245
and then you cut me
deeper than any blade
possibly could.

35:38.220 --> 35:41.212
She is your princess,
Kensei. I know that.

35:43.142 --> 35:47.181
And I swear I will
not give in to love.
That kiss will be our last.

35:49.773 --> 35:52.435
But the fate of the world
still rests in our hands.

35:52.526 --> 35:54.562
We must stop
White Beard.

36:01.744 --> 36:03.405
All right, Carp.

36:08.667 --> 36:09.952
Let's go.

36:13.422 --> 36:14.753
(GRUNTS)

36:22.473 --> 36:24.304
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

36:40.783 --> 36:43.149
You're covered
at work and at home.

36:43.243 --> 36:46.906
An impromptu Burger Bonanza
training seminar at corporate.

36:47.790 --> 36:49.280
Well, here.

36:50.459 --> 36:51.448
What's this?

36:51.543 --> 36:53.534
Information.
Phone numbers.

36:53.629 --> 36:56.496
If you have any questions
or concerns,
I want you to call us.

36:56.590 --> 36:59.582
Anytime.
Day or night.
Also, here...

37:01.136 --> 37:03.047
It's fully loaded.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.220
Anything.
From martial arts
to plumbing.

37:05.307 --> 37:09.266
Any skill you want
is now at your fingertips.

37:09.395 --> 37:10.805
Wow.

37:10.938 --> 37:13.930
Support, advice,
and now gifts.

37:15.484 --> 37:17.850
You're like my own
personal Oprah.

37:19.238 --> 37:21.980
You have
an amazing gift.

37:22.074 --> 37:24.690
So, look around.

37:24.827 --> 37:28.285
Seems to me like
this town could use
a little amazing.

37:33.168 --> 37:34.374
Thanks.

37:36.046 --> 37:37.206
Right.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.210
(DOOR OPENING)

37:52.521 --> 37:54.261
Hello, Dr. Suresh.

37:54.898 --> 37:56.013
Niki?

37:56.775 --> 37:57.764
How are you?

37:57.860 --> 37:59.100
I'm feeling
better now.

37:59.194 --> 38:01.526
Back to my old self,
thanks to the Company.

38:01.613 --> 38:04.480
In fact, I'm gonna
be working with them
for a while.

38:04.575 --> 38:05.781
So,youTeu.

38:05.868 --> 38:06.948
Your new partner.

38:08.203 --> 38:11.661
(CHUCKLES) I know.
It's the last place that
I expected to be, but,

38:13.417 --> 38:15.703
I owe these
people so much.

38:17.129 --> 38:20.963
Bob told me that you two
were having some trust issues.

38:21.133 --> 38:25.126
He just wants me
to make sure there's
no more misunderstandings.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.886
That's okay,
isn't it?

39:01.131 --> 39:02.746
What does it mean?

39:17.564 --> 39:19.100
Are you ready?
Yeah.

39:36.208 --> 39:37.948
What is this place?

39:40.379 --> 39:41.835
I don't know.

39:49.638 --> 39:51.720
Someone knew
I was coming.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.393
"We were right
about the Company.

39:58.480 --> 40:01.893
"The world is in danger.
It's up to us. Adam."

40:01.984 --> 40:03.895
The name Adam
doesn't ring a bell?

40:03.986 --> 40:07.649
No. And I don't know
about any Company.
I don't know about

40:07.739 --> 40:09.240
any of this.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.906
(SCOFFS) The world
is in danger. What am I
supposed to do?

40:15.831 --> 40:17.617
We'll figure
it out.

40:20.335 --> 40:23.873
Please tell me who I am.
What the future holds.

40:45.652 --> 40:47.608
Peter?
How did we...

40:48.363 --> 40:49.819
I don't know.

40:53.493 --> 40:55.620
We're in New York.

40:55.704 --> 40:57.035
Where is everyone?

40:59.708 --> 41:01.448
CAITLIN: It's an
evacuation order.

41:01.543 --> 41:03.204
PETER: June 14th, 2008.

41:06.214 --> 41:08.045
This is next year.
