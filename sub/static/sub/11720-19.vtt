guns in a gun deal?

Maybe a gun dealer
or something like that?

00:37.066 --> 00:38.265
Doesn't make sense.

Looks like you boys
got some bad intel.

00:44.153 --> 00:45.819
CHIN: Well, maybe they caught
wind we were coming

00:45.821 --> 00:46.953
and changed the menu.

00:47.063 --> 00:48.997
Or maybe the time
got moved up

Well, we'll canvass the area

saw anything.

Catherine, do me a favor,

00:54.304 --> 00:55.403
call the ATF, all right?

00:55.405 --> 00:57.338
See if anything's come
up on their radar.

00:57.340 --> 00:59.107

01:00.943 --> 01:03.144
Thanks for the
backup, Lou.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.212
You got it.

01:04.214 --> 01:07.048
All right, fellas,
let's pack it up.

01:07.050 --> 01:08.716
Maybe they moved
up the time?

01:08.718 --> 01:10.351
What do you
want me to say?

01:10.353 --> 01:11.586
Maybe that you
were wrong.

01:11.588 --> 01:13.121
That we should have
vetted this thing properly

01:13.123 --> 01:14.522
before we wasted
everybody's time.

01:14.524 --> 01:16.658
Maybe listening to a convicted
felon is not the right move.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.593
I-I don't want to put words
in your mouth though.

01:18.595 --> 01:20.228

Let me tell you something.

Just for the record,

01:24.968 --> 01:27.702
this is the same thing

consider, this is less about

more about protecting yourself.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.613
Protecting myself
from what?

05:32.615 --> 05:33.981
From getting into another

became the proud owner of that

06:15.658 --> 06:18.159
when you threw me in here.

06:19.161 --> 06:20.428
Well, that's because
your problem was

06:20.430 --> 06:21.713

12:02.320 --> 12:04.354
We need to get in there
and get them out of there.

12:04.356 --> 12:05.588
Before I start
bringing in heavy equipment

12:05.590 --> 12:06.889
and putting
my people at risk,

12:06.891 --> 12:09.025
I need to determine
if this is rescue or recovery.

12:09.027 --> 12:11.661
I understand you have a personal
relationship with these guys.

12:11.663 --> 12:12.862
You damn right, Hank.

12:12.864 --> 12:14.397
I know these guys.
They're survivors.

12:14.399 --> 12:16.232
And the longer we stand
around here waiting around,

12:16.234 --> 12:18.334
the less chance they have of
coming out of there alive.

12:18.336 --> 12:20.970
Protocol is: we don't dig
until we've located bodies.

12:20.972 --> 12:22.505
The sooner we pinpoint
their location,

12:22.507 --> 12:25.541
the sooner we come up
with a game plan, all right?

12:27.344 --> 12:28.845
Do your best.

12:28.847 --> 12:31.247
(groans)

12:31.249 --> 12:32.949
(helicopter whirring)

12:32.951 --> 12:34.984
Any update?
No.

12:34.986 --> 12:36.219
We're still trying
to locate them.

12:36.221 --> 12:37.453
Catherine and I have
been trying their cells,

12:37.455 --> 12:39.322
but it goes straight
to voice mail.

12:40.824 --> 12:42.992
We were set up.

12:44.795 --> 12:47.663
Bonilla's playing right field.

12:47.665 --> 12:49.098
Bret Saberhag... Bret...

12:49.100 --> 12:50.299
Bret Saberhagen's on the mound.

12:50.301 --> 12:51.934
Where the hell
you been?

12:51.936 --> 12:53.469
I moved on to
the '92 roster.

12:53.471 --> 12:54.704
It's a tough year.

12:54.706 --> 12:56.339
I found a flashlight.
We're gonna need that.

12:56.341 --> 12:57.306
Okay.

12:57.308 --> 12:58.841
You got to get this thing
off of me.

12:58.843 --> 13:00.977
(groaning)
Okay.

13:02.279 --> 13:04.447
When I lift this,

13:04.449 --> 13:05.715
you feel the weight
come off your leg,

13:05.717 --> 13:07.250
I need you to roll out,
slide your leg out, okay?

13:07.252 --> 13:08.484
But you got to do it quick.

13:08.486 --> 13:10.153
I don't know
how long I can hold this.

13:10.155 --> 13:11.354
That's very encouraging.

13:11.356 --> 13:12.989
I'm not even sure I can move.
You can. You can.

13:12.991 --> 13:14.390
You can, all right?

13:14.392 --> 13:15.425
Uh-huh.

13:15.427 --> 13:16.626
(groaning)

13:16.628 --> 13:18.394
All right, you ready?

13:18.396 --> 13:21.864
One, two, three.

13:21.866 --> 13:24.066
(groaning)

13:24.068 --> 13:25.768
Roll, roll, roll!

13:27.738 --> 13:29.572
Oh, that's no good.
Okay.

13:29.574 --> 13:30.907
(groaning)
You stay still.

13:30.909 --> 13:32.275
I got to look at this.

13:32.277 --> 13:33.776
Come on.
Oh, what is that?

13:35.712 --> 13:37.079
Okay, it's a piece of rebar.
(groaning)

13:37.081 --> 13:38.448
It's missed your vitals,
but I got to

13:38.450 --> 13:40.016
take it out.
The trick's gonna be

13:40.018 --> 13:41.851
to stop the bleeding.
Maybe don't take it out.

13:41.853 --> 13:44.120
Maybe we just leave
it in for a minute.

13:45.422 --> 13:46.622
(groaning)

13:46.624 --> 13:48.324
Leaving it in
is not an option.

13:48.326 --> 13:49.826
This gets infected,
sepsis sets in,

13:49.828 --> 13:51.227
then we got real trouble.

13:51.229 --> 13:52.762
You understand me?
We got to... (laughs)

13:52.764 --> 13:55.198
As opposed
to our current situation?

13:55.200 --> 13:56.466
Okay, stay still.
(groaning)

13:56.468 --> 13:57.967
I'm gonna be right back.

14:00.237 --> 14:01.671
Okay.

14:04.241 --> 14:06.108
(groaning)

14:06.977 --> 14:09.579
All right,
this has got peroxide in it.

14:09.581 --> 14:12.114
I can disinfect this wound.

14:12.116 --> 14:14.083
I'm not gonna lie to you;
this is gonna hurt a lot.

14:14.085 --> 14:16.052
(groaning)
The really bad pain

14:16.054 --> 14:17.553
only lasts a couple of seconds.

14:17.555 --> 14:19.956
You got to stay conscious.

14:19.958 --> 14:22.792
I'm right here.
All right?

14:22.794 --> 14:24.727
Ready?

14:24.729 --> 14:25.995
Two.

14:25.997 --> 14:26.896
Three.

14:26.898 --> 14:28.130
(screams):
Oh!

14:28.132 --> 14:29.232
(groans):
God!

14:29.234 --> 14:30.566
(yelling)

14:30.568 --> 14:32.401
All right,
all right.

14:32.403 --> 14:33.669
Stay with me, Danny.

14:33.671 --> 14:34.837
(groaning)

14:34.839 --> 14:36.539
Stay with me.
Hey, who played left?

14:36.541 --> 14:37.907
'86 Mets, left field--
who was it?

14:37.909 --> 14:39.909
George Foster,
and he was replaced

14:39.911 --> 14:42.545
by Mookie Wilson
after two seasons.

14:42.547 --> 14:44.580
Midseason, rig? That's my boy.
(laughing)

14:44.582 --> 14:47.183
Keep the pressure.
Keep the pressure, Danny.

14:47.185 --> 14:49.719
Stay with me.
(groaning)

14:52.456 --> 14:53.589
How we looking?

14:53.591 --> 14:56.325
Is it good?
It's good. Pretty good.

14:56.327 --> 14:59.395
Oh. Come on.

14:59.397 --> 15:01.797
(groaning loudly)

15:01.799 --> 15:03.232
Keep your weight
off that leg.

15:03.234 --> 15:06.602
Nah, I'm good. Let's get the
hell out of here. Come on.

15:06.604 --> 15:08.704
No, Danny. Hold up.
Uh, which way?

15:08.706 --> 15:11.274
We're not going
anywhere, buddy.

15:11.276 --> 15:13.543
Place is caved in.
We can't get out of here.

15:13.545 --> 15:15.711
(sighs)

15:17.514 --> 15:19.448
(metal creaking softly)

15:19.450 --> 15:21.017
(panting)

15:21.019 --> 15:22.785
Do me a favor,
would you, please?

15:22.787 --> 15:24.120
Of course. Whatever you need.

15:24.122 --> 15:26.322
Look at me in the eye--
look at me--

15:26.324 --> 15:27.857
and admit something to me.

15:27.859 --> 15:31.360
We should not have listened
to Dekker, hmm?

15:31.362 --> 15:34.297
You want to do that now?

15:34.299 --> 15:37.500
It was a lead we had
to follow, Danny, okay?

15:37.502 --> 15:40.436
And by the way, you're welcome
for saving your life.

15:42.339 --> 15:44.140
What is that,
a souvenir?

15:44.142 --> 15:45.541
Yeah, it's a souvenir.

15:45.543 --> 15:47.743
Rescue team would have
arrived already.

15:47.745 --> 15:48.844
They'd be listening in.

15:48.846 --> 15:50.980
Find something to bang on,
make some noise.

15:54.718 --> 15:57.353
(groaning)

15:57.355 --> 15:58.621
Sorry. That was rude.

15:58.623 --> 16:00.056
(spits)
What were you saying?

16:00.058 --> 16:01.524
Look, man, I'm telling you.

16:01.526 --> 16:02.925
My information was good.

16:02.927 --> 16:05.294
Now, if the deal got messy,
it's not on me.

16:05.296 --> 16:06.529
Wrong.
It's all on you.

16:06.531 --> 16:08.297
And I want the
names of the people

16:08.299 --> 16:09.665
who helped you
pull this off.

16:09.667 --> 16:12.001
You must have lost some hearing
in that explosion.

16:12.003 --> 16:13.703
I was just doing
my civic duty

16:13.705 --> 16:14.971
and passing along what I heard.

16:14.973 --> 16:16.806
From who?
(scoffs)

16:16.808 --> 16:19.508
Half the prison just saw you
haul my ass off the yard.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.510
Now, if I give up my source,
I'm a dead man.

16:21.512 --> 16:22.445
Know what I think?

16:22.447 --> 16:23.913
I think there
never was a source.

16:23.915 --> 16:25.781
I think this is all payback
for Five-O putting you in here.

16:25.783 --> 16:26.849
Why would I do that?

16:26.851 --> 16:28.851
I'm trying
to get the hell out of here,

16:28.853 --> 16:30.119
not add more years.

16:30.121 --> 16:32.021
CHIN: We're gonna find out
how you did this.

16:32.023 --> 16:35.091
Let me tell you
something else.

16:35.093 --> 16:39.095
If they die down there,
I'm gonna kill you myself.

16:46.762 --> 16:49.130
Someone on the outside
had to rig the explosives.

16:49.468 --> 16:51.468
Why don't you pull Dekker's
visitor log and phone records.

16:51.470 --> 16:52.769
Let's see who he's been
communicating with

16:52.771 --> 16:53.937
since he got here.

16:53.939 --> 16:55.205
Chin, Dekker's not
going anywhere.

16:55.207 --> 16:57.407
We should be back there
trying to find Steve and Danny.

16:57.409 --> 16:58.808
Hey, we got
the best people

16:58.810 --> 17:00.443
doing everything they
can to rescue them.

17:00.445 --> 17:02.846
Our job is to work the
case just like any other.

17:02.848 --> 17:05.281
We owe it to them to do that.

17:05.284 --> 17:08.184
(loud banging)

17:18.329 --> 17:19.963
(sirens wailing)

17:28.539 --> 17:30.073
(faint banging
through headphones)

17:30.075 --> 17:31.508
I got something!

17:31.510 --> 17:32.676
Over here!

17:32.678 --> 17:34.511
All right, hold the work!

17:34.513 --> 17:35.512
Hold the work!

17:35.514 --> 17:36.813
Everybody, quiet!

17:36.815 --> 17:38.815
Everybody stop moving!

17:44.889 --> 17:47.891
(faint banging
through headphones)

17:49.794 --> 17:51.294
It's them.

17:51.296 --> 17:53.496
They're alive.
Yes. Hank?

17:55.399 --> 17:57.934
All right, the noise seems
to be coming from this area.

17:57.936 --> 17:59.869
My engineers are already
working on an extraction plan.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.938
All right, how long?
Oh, there's a lot of guesswork here.

18:01.940 --> 18:03.340
GPR isn't giving us an image.

18:03.342 --> 18:05.942
Without knowing their precise
location, it could take hours.

18:05.944 --> 18:07.377
GROVER:
Cath, where you going?

18:07.379 --> 18:09.746
See if we can get a microphone
close enough to hear them.

18:09.748 --> 18:11.681
Maybe we can get
a cellular repeater down there.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.401
This is pointless.

18:31.403 --> 18:32.869
They can't hear us.

18:32.871 --> 18:35.672
(groans)

18:35.674 --> 18:37.340
(sighs)

18:39.243 --> 18:40.477
Oh, oh!
What?

18:40.479 --> 18:42.212
Can I die in peace, please?

18:42.214 --> 18:43.747
You're tired

18:43.749 --> 18:46.850
and you're hurting;
just take a break, all right?

18:46.852 --> 18:48.151
Hey.

18:48.153 --> 18:49.386
Do me a favor.
What?

18:49.388 --> 18:50.487
Please, for once in your life,

18:50.489 --> 18:51.855
just pretend
you're a human being,

18:51.857 --> 18:53.323
and take this situation
for what it is.

18:53.325 --> 18:54.724
Can you do that for me, please?

18:54.726 --> 18:56.326
I'm keenly aware
of the situation...

18:56.328 --> 18:58.795
Really? Because the
human response to certain death

18:58.797 --> 19:01.498
and, uh, the prospect
of never seeing the people

19:01.500 --> 19:04.234
you love ever again is curling
up into the fetal position

19:04.236 --> 19:06.035
and messing your pants.

19:06.037 --> 19:07.704
Okay, what good's
that gonna do you, huh?

19:07.706 --> 19:09.372
Fear is a state of mind,
Danny, okay?

19:09.374 --> 19:10.540
You got to fight through it.

19:10.542 --> 19:12.242
Oh, I-I disagree.

19:12.244 --> 19:14.144
I think that fear
is actually your friend.

19:14.146 --> 19:16.980
It tells you when you're
supposed to avoid a situation.

19:16.982 --> 19:18.448
But you never
listen to it.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.517
That is why we are here
in the first place.

19:20.519 --> 19:22.585
That would be a compelling
argument, my friend,

19:22.587 --> 19:25.088
if you weren't afraid
of absolutely everything.

19:25.090 --> 19:28.024
This morning,
you had a near mental breakdown

19:28.026 --> 19:29.526
because your girlfriend
met your kid.

19:29.528 --> 19:31.961
It doesn't matter
what the situation is for you.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.296
You gravitate to

19:33.298 --> 19:34.397
the worst possible outcomes.

19:34.399 --> 19:35.999
Once again, I'm proven right!

19:36.001 --> 19:37.233
We never should have gone

19:37.235 --> 19:40.036
in this situation blind
in the first place!

19:40.038 --> 19:41.271
(coughing)

19:41.273 --> 19:42.806
You all right?

19:42.808 --> 19:44.407
No, I'm not all right.

19:44.409 --> 19:46.876
(groans, sighs)

19:52.683 --> 19:54.784
Listen, all right?

19:54.786 --> 19:57.954
I'm sorry, okay?
Just please relax.

19:57.956 --> 20:01.090
The air is getting
thin in here.

20:01.092 --> 20:02.725
We got to conserve
this oxygen.

20:02.727 --> 20:04.828
(sighs)
Okay.

20:06.597 --> 20:09.199
(loud banging)

20:09.201 --> 20:10.533
Hey! Hey, hey!

20:10.535 --> 20:11.601
What?

20:11.603 --> 20:12.969
Maybe it's, uh,

20:12.971 --> 20:15.572
lack of oxygen, but something
ain't sitting right with me.

20:15.574 --> 20:17.974
We were
Dekker's target, right?

20:17.976 --> 20:18.942
Why this guy?

20:18.944 --> 20:20.610
Why the half-dead guy
in the closet?

20:20.612 --> 20:22.178
The call lured
us in here.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.379
For all we know,
this guy was bait.

20:23.381 --> 20:25.882
Why him? I mean,
you take a guy off the street,

20:25.884 --> 20:27.083
beat him half to death.

20:27.085 --> 20:28.384
Why him, specifically?

20:28.386 --> 20:30.019
I don't know.
My guess is:

20:30.021 --> 20:33.122
he wasn't chosen at random;
that's my guess.

20:35.292 --> 20:37.293
He's got no wallet.

20:37.295 --> 20:39.262
(loud banging)

20:39.264 --> 20:42.065
Couple pills.
I don't know.

20:42.067 --> 20:44.567
Medication, prescription,
something.

20:44.569 --> 20:46.669
Check his cell phone.

20:47.505 --> 20:50.473
It's all busted up.

20:50.475 --> 20:52.675
(banging continues)

21:00.017 --> 21:01.451
Steve.

21:01.453 --> 21:04.087
This guy's wired.

21:04.955 --> 21:06.856
He's wearing a camera.

21:06.858 --> 21:09.425
That's how they knew
when to detonate.

21:10.461 --> 21:12.529
That guy had somebody watching.

21:12.531 --> 21:14.230
(phone ringing)
Is that you?

21:14.232 --> 21:16.266
Huh?

21:16.268 --> 21:18.201
(groans)
It's me.

21:19.036 --> 21:20.937
It's Catherine.

21:20.939 --> 21:22.372
(ringing continues)

21:22.374 --> 21:24.474
It's Catherine.

21:25.309 --> 21:26.776
Catherine.

21:26.778 --> 21:27.810
CATHERINE:
Steve!

21:27.812 --> 21:29.546
Thank God.
Are you guys all right?

21:29.548 --> 21:31.548
Yeah, Danny's a little
banged up, but we're okay.

21:31.550 --> 21:32.849
Everybody else get out?

21:32.851 --> 21:34.851
GROVER: All accounted for
except you two stragglers.

21:34.853 --> 21:36.853
We got the whole cavalry up here
working to get you guys out.

21:36.855 --> 21:38.521
Great. We got
an ETA on that?

21:38.523 --> 21:40.523
I'm literally being held
together by duct tape.

21:40.525 --> 21:41.824
CATHERINE:
Yeah, we're working on it.

21:41.826 --> 21:43.593
We need to know
your exact location.

21:43.595 --> 21:46.162
We're in the maintenance room,
south side of the garage.

21:46.164 --> 21:47.430
Got it.
Get over here.

21:47.432 --> 21:48.531
Steve, how's the oxygen?

21:48.533 --> 21:50.099
It's running low.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.535
Is there anything we can do from
this end to speed things up?

21:52.537 --> 21:53.736
Just hang tight.

21:53.738 --> 21:56.506
Listen, the entire area
is unstable.

21:56.508 --> 21:58.508
You go moving something
you're not supposed to,

21:58.510 --> 22:00.410
the whole damn thing'll
come crashing down.

22:00.412 --> 22:01.644
(metal creaking softly)

22:01.646 --> 22:03.079
Ah, that's encouraging.

22:03.081 --> 22:05.114
Steve, what happened?
You were right behind us.

22:05.116 --> 22:07.150
Listen, you think you can
establish a video call?

22:07.152 --> 22:08.685
I want to show you something.

22:15.459 --> 22:16.326
Hi-ya.

22:16.328 --> 22:18.695
It's not as bad
as it looks.

22:18.697 --> 22:20.997
Thanks for trying to
make me feel better.

22:20.999 --> 22:22.599
You say you wanted
to show us something.

22:22.601 --> 22:24.367
STEVE:
Yeah, take a look at this.

22:26.136 --> 22:27.870
Cath, can you
capture that?

22:29.607 --> 22:31.274
(shutter clicks) CATHERINE: Got it.
I'll run these photos

22:31.276 --> 22:33.409
through the database
and see if I can get an I.D.

22:33.411 --> 22:35.645
Look for any connection to JC
Dekker and his crew, all right?

22:35.647 --> 22:37.413
I want to know how
this guy got down here.

22:37.415 --> 22:38.414
Roger that.

22:38.416 --> 22:40.917
MAX:
<i>Those pills you found</i>

22:40.919 --> 22:44.721
on your victim are warfarin--
500 milligrams.

22:44.723 --> 22:47.190
It is an anticoagulant
commonly used

22:47.192 --> 22:49.325
to treat patients
with heart conditions.

22:49.327 --> 22:50.860
Well, how common is it, Max?

22:50.862 --> 22:52.795
Catherine couldn't I.D.
this guy; that's our only lead.

22:52.797 --> 22:53.930
Well, it's the most

22:53.932 --> 22:55.832
widely prescribed
blood thinner out there.

22:55.834 --> 22:58.067
Can you open his shirt?

22:58.069 --> 23:00.069
STEVE:
Max, what are you looking for?

23:00.071 --> 23:03.840
Well, his current state
of death aside, your victim

23:03.842 --> 23:06.509
is young and appears to be
in good physical condition,

23:06.511 --> 23:08.745
which leads me
to suspect that the victim

23:08.747 --> 23:12.081
was prescribed this drug
post-op-- not to treat

23:12.083 --> 23:13.683
a chronic heart
condition.

23:13.685 --> 23:15.351
Yeah, Max, good call.

23:15.353 --> 23:16.786
He's got a surgical
scar right here.

23:16.788 --> 23:18.254
Gall bladder.

23:18.256 --> 23:19.322
Maybe kidneys.

23:19.324 --> 23:21.190
From the look of the scar,
it appears that

23:21.192 --> 23:23.393
he went under the knife
in the last three months.

23:23.395 --> 23:27.196
All right, Max, listen,
contact all area hospitals.

23:27.198 --> 23:30.133
Get a list of patients
who have had similar surgeries.

23:30.135 --> 23:32.835
Cross-reference them against
our vic's description, okay?

23:32.837 --> 23:34.303
Right away, Commander.

23:34.305 --> 23:36.572
I can't let you through.
Sir, please, I... I just need

23:36.574 --> 23:38.307
to find out
if Detective Williams is okay.

23:38.309 --> 23:40.209
I'm sorry, ma'am.
He's a friend of mine.

23:40.211 --> 23:42.712
My name is Amber Vitale.
If-if there's anything...

23:42.714 --> 23:44.180
Uh, she's good.
She's with me.

23:44.182 --> 23:45.248
Amber?

23:45.250 --> 23:47.116
Yeah. I'm Kono.
I work with Danny.

23:47.118 --> 23:48.317
I just saw it on the news,

23:48.319 --> 23:50.153
and I got over here
as fast as I could,

23:50.155 --> 23:51.487
but nobody's
telling me anything.

23:51.489 --> 23:52.855
He's alive.
Okay.

23:52.857 --> 23:54.691
We're doing everything we
can to get him to safety.

23:54.693 --> 23:55.992
Come on, I'll
find you a seat.

23:55.994 --> 23:57.627
Danny's gonna want to see
you when he gets out.

23:57.629 --> 23:59.762
We any closer
to getting those guys out?

23:59.764 --> 24:01.364
Thanks to Catherine,
we know where they are,

24:01.366 --> 24:03.733
but, uh, still trying
to find a way down.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.836
How you holding up?

24:08.305 --> 24:11.407
I'm, uh... I'm just
trying to stay positive.

24:12.509 --> 24:15.344
This is a lot worse
than I imagined.

24:15.346 --> 24:17.046
You got something, Max?
Surgical records

24:17.048 --> 24:18.648
for every gall bladder
and kidney operation

24:18.650 --> 24:19.916
performed in the
last three months.

24:19.918 --> 24:23.386
23 patients match your
John Doe's description.

24:23.388 --> 24:24.954
Okay, good.
I'll run the list through DMV

24:24.956 --> 24:26.756
and see if I can
put together a photo array.

24:26.758 --> 24:28.391
I don't think that's
gonna be necessary.

24:29.193 --> 24:31.194
Take a look
at this name.

24:31.196 --> 24:33.362
Marcus Dekker.

24:33.364 --> 24:35.298
So our victim is
JC Dekker's brother.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.166
MAX:
He's 25 years old.

24:37.168 --> 24:39.168
He had his gall bladder
removed last month,

24:39.170 --> 24:40.937
and warfarin was
prescribed to him

24:40.939 --> 24:43.005
to treat his post-op
clotting issues.

24:43.007 --> 24:46.008
Marcus just graduated from
UCLA Law four months ago.

24:46.010 --> 24:48.511
He just moved home
and was studying for the bar.

24:48.513 --> 24:50.314
CATHERINE: Guess who bankrolled
his education.

24:50.315 --> 24:51.748
His big brother?

24:51.750 --> 24:53.249
GROVER:
That's right.

24:53.251 --> 24:55.752
So how did their relationship
go from that to this?

24:55.754 --> 24:58.221
Unless Dekker
didn't put him down here.

24:58.223 --> 24:59.989
What are you thinking, Steve?

24:59.991 --> 25:02.658
Dekker's been working
with ATF for months now, right?

25:02.660 --> 25:05.762
What if somebody he helped
to put away found that out

25:05.764 --> 25:06.996
and used it against him?

25:06.998 --> 25:10.967
Right, so Dekker gets a
fake tip about a gun deal,

25:10.969 --> 25:12.468
he passes it on.

25:12.470 --> 25:14.237
They know he's
gonna pass it on.

25:14.239 --> 25:16.639
So, bomb goes off,
few cops get killed,

25:16.641 --> 25:19.075
and, uh, Dekker
takes the fall.

25:19.077 --> 25:20.309
And as added insult,

25:20.311 --> 25:21.944
they throw his brother down
there to send a message.

25:21.946 --> 25:23.946
It's a cold way
to get revenge.

25:42.339 --> 25:45.407
Marcus was a good kid, man.

25:47.644 --> 25:51.547
He did well in school,
never got into trouble.

25:51.549 --> 25:53.849
I made sure of that.

25:53.851 --> 25:56.885
I was always
looking out for him.

25:56.887 --> 26:00.155
So he wouldn't go down
the same path as you.

26:01.825 --> 26:04.727
That's why you put him
through law school?

26:04.729 --> 26:06.862
(sighs)

26:10.367 --> 26:12.301
When I got busted,

26:12.303 --> 26:14.503
Marcus found out
where the money came from.

26:14.505 --> 26:17.873
He wanted nothing
to do with me.

26:17.875 --> 26:21.176
I was hoping to get out of here
one day and make things right.

26:21.178 --> 26:22.444
CHIN: And that's why
you turned informant,

26:22.446 --> 26:23.612
so you could get
an early release.

26:23.614 --> 26:26.315
Well, someone
inside this prison

26:26.317 --> 26:28.016
took exception to that.

26:29.319 --> 26:31.086
Two of our guys are trapped,

26:31.088 --> 26:33.389
and Marcus is dead.

26:35.125 --> 26:37.693
They tried
to pin that all on you.

26:41.631 --> 26:44.133
The tip came
from a guy on my block,

26:44.135 --> 26:46.635
goes by the name of Spider.

26:48.104 --> 26:49.538
Said he was
giving me the info

26:49.540 --> 26:51.240
'cause he couldn't use it.

26:51.242 --> 26:52.541
Didn't that seem suspicious
to you?

26:52.543 --> 26:55.010
Guy's a lifer.

26:55.012 --> 26:56.678
What good was it to him?

26:56.680 --> 26:57.980
Think, JC.

26:57.982 --> 27:00.382
Why would Spider set you up?

27:00.384 --> 27:02.384
I don't know.

27:02.386 --> 27:04.186
Up until now,
we've been cool.

27:04.188 --> 27:05.387
Never had any beef
with him.

27:05.389 --> 27:06.822
Let's pull his file.

27:06.824 --> 27:09.224
I want to know everything about
him before we get him in a room.

27:09.226 --> 27:12.361
Spider's never
gonna talk to you.

27:12.363 --> 27:15.697
You have nothing
to offer a guy serving life.

27:16.966 --> 27:20.135
There's another way to do this.

27:28.912 --> 27:30.345
Here.

27:30.347 --> 27:32.714
I'd prefer not
to drink toilet water.

27:32.716 --> 27:34.850
It isn't toilet water.
It's not from

27:34.852 --> 27:37.085
a fresh mountain spring, okay,
but it's not sewage.

27:37.087 --> 27:38.320
It's drinkable, Danny.

27:38.322 --> 27:40.689
Take it.

27:42.559 --> 27:43.892
Don't look at it.

27:43.894 --> 27:45.461
It's over 100 degrees down here.

27:45.463 --> 27:47.663
If you want to live,
drink the water.

27:54.137 --> 27:57.039
Ah, it's awesome.

27:57.041 --> 27:59.241
We've looked at every possible
extraction point.

27:59.243 --> 28:00.876
None are stable enough to
bring in the equipment

28:00.878 --> 28:02.177
we need to get
down there.

28:02.179 --> 28:04.012
Hey, how are we supposed
to get them out?

28:04.014 --> 28:06.548
We can't. At least not
from where they are.

28:06.550 --> 28:08.784
We got to get
them moving.

28:08.786 --> 28:10.519
Now, there's a mechanical room
30 yards from their position.

28:10.521 --> 28:12.120
If they can somehow make
their way over there,

28:12.122 --> 28:13.589
we may be able
to pull them up

28:13.591 --> 28:14.756
through the
ventilation shaft.

28:14.758 --> 28:16.825
30 yards. That might
as well be 30 miles.

28:16.827 --> 28:19.161
Well, I didn't say it
was gonna be easy.

28:19.163 --> 28:20.395
They're gonna have to
navigate some tight spaces,

28:20.397 --> 28:22.798
move heavy debris with
little to no light.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.700
Well, they'll never make it.
Danny's injured.

28:24.702 --> 28:27.035
GROVER:
Hank, just tell me one thing.

28:27.037 --> 28:29.104
Is this our only option?

28:29.106 --> 28:32.374
If we do nothing,
they'll run out of oxygen.

28:32.376 --> 28:35.344
Oh, good. The, uh...
escape-through-the-vent trick.

28:35.346 --> 28:36.645
That's-that's the big plan?

28:36.647 --> 28:38.447
That's what we're gonna do?
That's great.

28:38.449 --> 28:39.448
It's our best shot.

28:39.450 --> 28:40.582
Okay, well, what about the part

28:40.584 --> 28:41.783
where we're not supposed
to touch anything;

28:41.785 --> 28:43.652
if we do, the whole thing
could cave in on us?

28:43.654 --> 28:45.153
GROVER:
That's still true,

28:45.155 --> 28:47.389
so please be careful.

28:48.625 --> 28:50.192
Do me a favor.

28:50.194 --> 28:54.062
You know that sushi place
you like so much on King Street?

28:54.064 --> 28:56.532
Give them call,
make a reservation for tonight,

28:56.534 --> 28:58.767
you and me, okay?
I'm just gonna have to grab

28:58.769 --> 28:59.902
a quick shower first.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.670
Will do.

29:01.672 --> 29:04.940
Hey, Danny, there's someone here
who wants to talk to you.

29:05.975 --> 29:08.343
It's okay.

29:09.178 --> 29:10.879
Hey.

29:10.881 --> 29:12.548
Hey, Jersey.

29:12.550 --> 29:14.349
Hey, doll. You look fantastic.

29:14.351 --> 29:16.852
Been that kind of a day, huh?

29:16.854 --> 29:18.587
Sorry about this morning.
I meant to call you, but, uh...

29:18.589 --> 29:19.721
Save it.

29:19.723 --> 29:20.822
I've heard that whole

29:20.824 --> 29:23.225
trapped-under-the-building
excuse before.

29:23.227 --> 29:25.694
I'd laugh,
only it hurts too much.

29:25.696 --> 29:27.896
How'd you, uh... how'd you know
to come down here?

29:27.898 --> 29:29.298
Well, it was all over the news.

29:29.300 --> 29:32.000
Okay, Amber, listen to me.

29:32.002 --> 29:33.969
Uh... (sighs)

29:33.971 --> 29:36.138
Grace gets out of school
in a little while,

29:36.140 --> 29:37.973
and, uh...
and Rachel's out of town.

29:37.975 --> 29:39.641
Of course, I'll pick her up.

29:39.643 --> 29:42.144
Um... what do you want me
to tell her?

29:42.146 --> 29:44.613
Uh, tell her
that I'm running late.

29:44.615 --> 29:48.116
I'll be home in a
little bit. Um...

29:48.118 --> 29:50.118
Listen, you can't let her
use her phone,

29:50.120 --> 29:52.621
uh, can't let her
leave the house,

29:52.623 --> 29:54.356
can't let her turn on the TV.

29:54.358 --> 29:57.326
So, you want me
to tell her she's grounded?

29:57.328 --> 29:59.328
Exactly. Tell her
she's grounded.

29:59.330 --> 30:00.329
She's gonna want to talk to you.

30:00.331 --> 30:01.697
Tell her I'll talk to her

30:01.699 --> 30:03.432
right when I get home.

30:24.420 --> 30:25.754
Surprise, bitch.

30:26.589 --> 30:27.823
(punch lands)

30:27.825 --> 30:29.758
CHIN:
I'm guessing

30:29.760 --> 30:31.026
that belonged to Spider?

30:31.028 --> 30:34.363
His jaw's being wired shut
right about now.

30:34.365 --> 30:36.231
I doubt he'll be needing that.

30:36.233 --> 30:38.300
So that explains how he
coordinated the bombing.

30:38.302 --> 30:39.568
Contraband phone.

30:39.570 --> 30:41.269
Guards couldn't
monitor his calls.

30:41.271 --> 30:43.605
Except Spider had nothing
to do with no bomb.

30:43.607 --> 30:44.906
What are you talking about?

30:44.908 --> 30:46.642
He said,
a couple weeks back,

30:46.644 --> 30:49.011
a stranger hit him up
on his cell.

30:49.013 --> 30:51.079
Told him to check
his commissary balance.

30:51.081 --> 30:53.081
He does,
there's five Gs in there.

30:53.083 --> 30:54.916
So, next time Mystery Man calls,

30:54.918 --> 30:57.185
he's got Spider's
attention.

30:57.187 --> 30:59.421
Said there's another 20 large
in it for him

30:59.423 --> 31:02.357
if he gets me to drop a tip
about an upcoming gun buy.

31:02.359 --> 31:04.593
So this stranger
on the outside used Spider

31:04.595 --> 31:06.028
to feed you the information.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.195
And Spider convinced me

31:07.197 --> 31:08.864
the ATF was selling me short,

31:08.866 --> 31:11.033
and you guys would give me
a better deal.

31:11.035 --> 31:12.768
Turns out,
he only got paid

31:12.770 --> 31:15.070
if I delivered the tip
to Five-O.

31:16.806 --> 31:20.008
This was never about
a prison beef.

31:20.010 --> 31:22.611
This was someone
coming after us.

31:24.047 --> 31:25.547
(metal creaking)

31:25.549 --> 31:27.049
(loud clattering)

31:28.451 --> 31:29.851
(groans)

31:34.323 --> 31:36.224
We work together,
we get out of here.

31:36.226 --> 31:37.592
All right?

31:37.594 --> 31:40.028
Give me a hand
with this thing.

31:41.230 --> 31:42.764
Oh, yeah.

31:42.766 --> 31:45.367
The worst game
of Jenga ever.

31:45.369 --> 31:47.536
(metal creaking)

31:47.538 --> 31:49.271
(loud clattering)

31:57.613 --> 32:00.782
(grunting)

32:00.784 --> 32:02.150
She's pretty.

32:02.152 --> 32:04.519
Oh. What?
Amber.

32:04.521 --> 32:05.987
Can tell she really cares
about you, too.

32:05.989 --> 32:08.890
Yeah, I'll probably screw it up
like I do everything else.

32:08.892 --> 32:11.693
Right?
Not in my DNA to be happy.

32:11.695 --> 32:13.695
I didn't mean that.
That's not what I meant.

32:13.697 --> 32:16.131
No, I'm officially
agreeing with you.

32:16.133 --> 32:20.435
There is something wrong
with the way that I am built.

32:20.437 --> 32:22.537
I-I can't, uh...

32:22.539 --> 32:25.540
I can't just enjoy happiness
like regular people, you know?

32:25.542 --> 32:28.009
You don't think you're being
a little hard on yourself?

32:28.011 --> 32:29.745
No, I don't.

32:29.747 --> 32:32.080
When I was a kid,

32:32.082 --> 32:33.749
my parents would go out
to eat dinner.

32:33.751 --> 32:36.451
If they were late coming home,
I used to imagine that

32:36.453 --> 32:37.519
they died in a car wreck,

32:37.521 --> 32:38.720
just 'cause
they were 15 minutes late.

32:38.722 --> 32:40.255
And I used to talk to God
and beg him.

32:40.257 --> 32:41.990
I said, "Please just
take my dad, not my mom."

32:41.992 --> 32:43.658
'Cause I couldn't live
without my mom.

32:43.660 --> 32:46.228
I mean, every time something
good happens in my life,

32:46.230 --> 32:48.897
I-I just... I think
of when it's gonna end.

32:48.899 --> 32:50.699
That's all I can think about.

32:50.701 --> 32:53.168
(groans)

32:56.205 --> 32:57.706
You for real?

32:57.708 --> 32:58.774
Yeah.

32:58.776 --> 33:00.041
That's not normal.

33:00.043 --> 33:01.910
I know it's not normal.

33:01.912 --> 33:03.712
Listen to this.

33:03.714 --> 33:05.080
On my wedding day,

33:05.082 --> 33:09.117
I'm looking at Rachel,
just about to say "I do."

33:09.119 --> 33:11.620
And all I can see is the day
she's gonna serve me

33:11.622 --> 33:12.921
with divorce papers.

33:12.923 --> 33:14.990
No joke.

33:14.992 --> 33:16.658
And I... I don't know, man.

33:16.660 --> 33:19.194
The only sustained happiness
I ever felt in my life

33:19.196 --> 33:20.495
so far is Grace.

33:20.497 --> 33:22.164
And, you know,
it's just a matter of time

33:22.166 --> 33:24.332
before she turns 18,
and then she's out the door

33:24.334 --> 33:26.835
and she... marries some schmuck.

33:26.837 --> 33:28.103
I don't know.

33:28.105 --> 33:30.605
You got to change, man.
You can't live like that.

33:30.607 --> 33:32.274
Well, I'd like very much
to change.

33:32.276 --> 33:34.309
It's just not so simple,
you know?

33:34.311 --> 33:36.111
Take Amber, all right?

33:36.113 --> 33:37.846
Start small.

33:37.848 --> 33:41.116
Instead of pushing her
away, like you always do,

33:41.118 --> 33:43.084
fixate on how she's
gonna break your heart,

33:43.086 --> 33:44.653
she's gonna
destroy your life...

33:46.455 --> 33:49.224
...bring her in,
bring her closer.

33:52.495 --> 33:54.062
All right, I'll give it a shot.

33:54.064 --> 33:55.864
What?
I said I'll give it a shot.

33:55.866 --> 33:58.066
I make it out of here alive,
I'll give it a shot.

33:58.068 --> 33:59.701
Really?
Yeah, really.

33:59.703 --> 34:02.504
That's good. That's good.
Thank you.

34:02.506 --> 34:04.573
(groaning)

34:04.575 --> 34:06.074
(metal creaking loudly)

34:06.076 --> 34:07.242
Oh, oh!

34:07.244 --> 34:10.946
(loud rumbling)

34:10.947 --> 34:12.447
What the hell was that?

34:12.449 --> 34:14.114
(busy tone beeping)

34:14.117 --> 34:16.016
Damn it. I can't get
ahold of them.

34:16.018 --> 34:18.719
All nonessential personnel,
fall back now!

34:18.722 --> 34:19.588
MAN:
Move, move, move!

34:19.590 --> 34:21.022
That includes you two.

34:21.024 --> 34:22.456
We're not going anywhere.

34:26.596 --> 34:29.164
(straining)

34:29.166 --> 34:30.732
What's doing?

34:30.734 --> 34:33.400
(panting)
It's too heavy.

34:33.402 --> 34:36.938
You know, I'm trying, uh, really
hard to stay positive here.

34:39.876 --> 34:42.110
What are you looking for?

34:42.112 --> 34:44.411
I'm looking for that.

34:44.414 --> 34:46.581
You see that piece of pipe
hanging over you, Danny?

34:46.583 --> 34:49.650
Break it off and seal off
one end for me.

34:49.652 --> 34:52.454
What are you gonna do with it?

34:52.989 --> 34:54.422
This slab of concrete--

34:54.424 --> 34:56.491
I'm gonna blow it up.
You're gonna what?

34:56.493 --> 34:59.127
How does this not end
with both of us dying?

34:59.129 --> 35:02.264
You're gonna blow
something up?

35:03.299 --> 35:04.733
Called a
directional charge.

35:04.735 --> 35:07.235
Sends the explosive energy
in one direction.

35:07.237 --> 35:09.638
Anything that's behind it,

35:09.640 --> 35:11.940
theoretically,
is reasonably safe.

35:11.942 --> 35:13.208
It's, what, reasonably...

35:13.210 --> 35:15.777
Nothing of what you just said
sounds reasonable, okay?

35:16.512 --> 35:17.479
(groans)

35:18.314 --> 35:20.548
It's the best I could do.

35:22.418 --> 35:24.586
(groans)

35:34.530 --> 35:36.665
This gonna work?

35:38.501 --> 35:40.769
I don't know.

36:09.666 --> 36:11.367
Back up. Get up in there.

36:11.369 --> 36:12.735
Hold on. Before we do this,

36:12.737 --> 36:14.470
I just want you
to know one thing.

36:14.472 --> 36:16.038
What?

36:16.040 --> 36:20.676
Whatever happens,
I really, really...

36:20.678 --> 36:24.680
from the bottom of my heart,
hate you so much.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.649
(both laughing)

36:30.554 --> 36:32.655
I love you, too, pal.

36:32.657 --> 36:34.990
I guess there's
a lot worse people

36:34.992 --> 36:36.793
to die under a big pile
of concrete with, huh?

36:36.794 --> 36:38.594
You want to do the honors?
No, no.

36:38.596 --> 36:40.429
It's your stupid idea--
you do it.

36:40.431 --> 36:42.598
(exhales)

36:52.209 --> 36:53.809
(explosion)
GROVER: Hold the work!

36:53.811 --> 36:54.843
Nobody move!
What is that?

36:54.845 --> 36:56.979
We got to move out.
Move, move, move!

36:56.981 --> 36:58.013
Give me a light.
Let's go.

36:58.015 --> 36:59.815
Pull back.

37:05.889 --> 37:07.210
Hank, you see anything
down there?

37:09.392 --> 37:11.393
Hank!

37:11.395 --> 37:13.295
(faint coughing)

37:13.297 --> 37:15.164
We got movement.
Bring up the line now!

37:18.835 --> 37:20.669
Go!

37:21.538 --> 37:23.172
Bring up the line!

37:33.416 --> 37:35.117
Danny, come on.

37:35.119 --> 37:38.187
Come on. Here you go,
here you go. I got you.

37:38.189 --> 37:39.521
I got you.

37:39.523 --> 37:41.357
(groaning)

37:42.993 --> 37:46.228
Steve. You got to get Steve.
He's still down there.

37:46.230 --> 37:49.070
Let's get that line down there. Hurry up!
Let's get that looked at, huh?

37:51.601 --> 37:53.281
CATHERINE: It's coming, Steve.
It's coming.

37:59.909 --> 38:00.976
Oh, yeah, come on.

38:00.978 --> 38:03.545
This way,
this way, this way.

38:03.547 --> 38:04.780
Thank God.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.448
It's good to see you topside,

38:06.450 --> 38:09.051
Commander.

38:21.331 --> 38:24.400
I never worried,
never worried.

38:24.402 --> 38:26.435
I don't doubt it.

38:33.343 --> 38:36.512
It's good to see you, boss.

38:36.514 --> 38:38.414
Guys, thank you.
(siren whoops)

38:49.326 --> 38:50.993
Danno!

38:50.995 --> 38:52.728
I'm okay, monkey.
All right.

38:52.730 --> 38:54.296
I'm okay.

38:57.500 --> 38:58.967
I'm all right.

39:00.136 --> 39:02.805
Hey, I want you
to meet somebody.

39:03.907 --> 39:05.974
This is
Steve McGarrett. Amber.

39:05.976 --> 39:07.276
Hi.

39:07.278 --> 39:08.911
Nice to finally meet you.

39:09.846 --> 39:11.947
You, too.

39:11.949 --> 39:14.116
Guys, give me one sec
with Steve, all right?

39:17.754 --> 39:19.888
Well, if this is the, uh,

39:19.890 --> 39:21.557
power of positive thinking,
I, uh...

39:21.559 --> 39:23.425
I like it. It's good.

39:23.427 --> 39:24.793
You know, it's the
same as you, uh...

39:24.795 --> 39:26.195
you admitting
that I was right,

39:26.197 --> 39:29.431
but I don't want to put words
in your mouth right now.

39:29.433 --> 39:31.767
When we were in there,
you said, uh...

39:31.769 --> 39:34.136
you know, before you did
the thing with the bomb,

39:34.138 --> 39:35.471
you said what you said.

39:35.473 --> 39:37.973
I want you to know, I...
I feel the same way.

39:37.975 --> 39:40.042
How is that exactly?

39:40.044 --> 39:42.044
Gonna make me say it?

39:43.012 --> 39:45.347
Come here.

39:45.349 --> 39:46.815
I love you.

39:46.817 --> 39:49.551
I love you, buddy.

39:49.553 --> 39:53.389
I-I, uh, got to go get this
properly stitched up...

39:53.391 --> 39:54.162
Yeah, you should.

39:54.187 --> 39:56.187
And I'm not coming in
to work tomorrow.

39:56.327 --> 39:58.060
Or for the rest of the week.
Good.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.962
All right?
I'm taking Amber to Maui.

39:59.964 --> 40:01.730
Heal up over there,
relax.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.532
Nice beaches over there.

40:03.534 --> 40:05.634
Nice beaches? I won't see
a single one of them.

40:05.636 --> 40:07.403
All right?
Call me.

40:17.647 --> 40:19.415
CHIN: Hey.
Hey.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.750
Fong ran Spider's cell.
In the past 48 hours,

40:21.752 --> 40:23.852
he got three incoming calls,
all from the same number.

40:23.854 --> 40:25.554
We get a name?
KONO: No, it's a burner.

40:25.556 --> 40:28.323
But it's on right now,
and we triangulated a position.

40:28.325 --> 40:31.059
What's the location?
It's an office building in Chinatown.

40:31.061 --> 40:32.628
There's only one tenant.

40:32.630 --> 40:34.997
It's a consulting firm
owned by an Edward Cobb.

40:34.999 --> 40:37.299
Edward Cobb.
Who's Edward Cobb?

40:37.301 --> 40:39.868
And why the hell is
he coming after us?

40:39.870 --> 40:41.203
Edward Cobb is ex-CIA.

40:41.205 --> 40:45.240
He ran black ops
in Southeast Asia in the '70s.

40:46.476 --> 40:49.344
This was never about Five-O.

40:51.915 --> 40:54.716
NEWS REPORTER: <i>After being</i>
<i>trapped under the rubble</i>

40:54.718 --> 40:56.652
for several hours,
Commander McGarrett

40:56.654 --> 40:58.787
and Detective Williams were
rescued just a short time ago.

40:58.789 --> 41:00.489
The cause of the explosion
is still under investigation.

41:00.491 --> 41:01.924
Honolulu Fire Chief
Hank Iona is expected

41:01.926 --> 41:03.091
to make a statement very soon.

41:03.093 --> 41:04.593
(phone ringing, TV mutes)

41:11.334 --> 41:13.402
Looks like you had a bad day,
Commander.

41:13.404 --> 41:15.671
STEVE: Not as bad
as you would've liked.

41:15.673 --> 41:19.475
I know you set me up
to keep me quiet about Cambodia.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.743
But I'm still here.

41:21.745 --> 41:24.680
Question is:
have you gotten the message?

41:32.121 --> 41:34.289
No.

41:41.965 --> 41:44.099
That's pretty clever.

41:44.101 --> 41:47.102
They would've pulled
three bodies out of that rubble,

41:47.104 --> 41:48.971
assumed that Dekker's brother
was killed for payback

41:48.973 --> 41:50.672
and Five-O got caught
in the middle.

41:50.674 --> 41:52.941
No one ever
would've suspected that

41:52.943 --> 41:55.511
this was all about keeping me
from asking questions

41:55.513 --> 41:57.145
you didn't want answered.

41:58.181 --> 42:01.783
You should've listened
to Sam, left this alone.

42:01.785 --> 42:03.585
An innocent man died today.

42:03.587 --> 42:05.621
For no reason.

42:05.623 --> 42:09.291
And dozens, dozens of innocent
lives were put in danger,

42:09.293 --> 42:12.094
all to clean up a mess
that you made 40 years ago.

42:12.096 --> 42:13.662
Now, what happened
in Cambodia?

42:13.664 --> 42:15.631
Who was buried in that grave?

42:21.004 --> 42:23.472
Consider your next
move very carefully.

42:26.643 --> 42:29.478
You consider yours.

42:29.480 --> 42:31.847
I still got DNA from that grave,

42:31.849 --> 42:34.283
and I'm gonna run it.

42:34.285 --> 42:37.786
So you might as well tell me
who it belongs to.

42:37.788 --> 42:40.155
Lei Kuan Fat.

42:40.157 --> 42:42.190
Wo Fat's mother.

42:42.192 --> 42:43.892
Why would you cover that up?

42:43.894 --> 42:46.161
Because it wasn't supposed
to be her in that grave.

42:46.163 --> 42:49.164
Our target was Wo Fat's father,
but the op went bad.

42:49.166 --> 42:51.567
My agent
on the ground disappeared,

42:51.569 --> 42:53.969
leaving me to clean up her mess.

42:55.738 --> 42:57.739
That agent was my mother.

42:57.741 --> 42:59.741
But she went on

42:59.743 --> 43:03.445
to work for the agency,
while you were forced out.

43:03.447 --> 43:05.080
She didn't botch the job.

43:05.082 --> 43:09.051
You ordered an unsanctioned hit
that went bad.

43:10.253 --> 43:13.555
Wo Fat's father is
still alive, isn't he?

43:13.557 --> 43:16.224
Do you have any idea the fallout

43:16.226 --> 43:18.827
if that ever
came to light?

43:18.829 --> 43:20.462
Where is he?
Sit down.

43:20.464 --> 43:23.131
I'll tell you.
