NO. HAVE YOU?

09:25.125 --> 09:27.208

YOU KNOW THAT GRAMS HAS
A MORE EXCITING LIFE AT 76

09:50.041 --> 09:51.542

IF WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO MOVE FORWARD THIS YEAR,

ABOUT OUR LIVES.

SUSPICIOUSLY
LIKE SUMMER CAMP,

ONLY FOR LONGER,
AND IT'S MUCH
FARTHER AWAY.

THIS THING,

WE'RE GONNA BE FINE,
MISS PEARL.

IF NOTHING GOES WRONG
OR ANYTHING,

MISS PEARL?

12:12.041 --> 12:13.875
YES, MARIE,
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG.

12:13.875 --> 12:16.125
THERE IS SOMETHING
VERY, VERY WRONG.

12:16.125 --> 12:17.834
IT APPEARS THAT THERE IS
A SUBSTANCE

12:19.917 --> 12:22.208

12:22.208 --> 12:23.375
I DON'T THINK SO.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.375

12:25.375 --> 12:28.583

THAT YOU MAKE AN APPOINTMENT

AS YOU'VE GOT SOME TIME,

12:30.041 --> 12:33.333

12:36.917 --> 12:39.500
SORRY,
I REALLY NEED THIS JOB.

12:39.500 --> 12:43.959

NOT TO PUKE WHEN THEY
PICK UP THEIR SILVERWARE.

12:43.959 --> 12:45.125
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

12:47.875 --> 12:48.250
YOU CAN'T FIRE MARIE.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.375
CAN'T I?

12:50.375 --> 12:51.708
NO, YOU CAN'T, BECAUSE
THE WOMAN IS RAISING

12:51.708 --> 12:53.792
HER 4-YEAR-OLD CHILD
ALL BY HERSELF
ON ACCOUNT OF THE FACT

12:53.792 --> 12:55.166
THAT THE FATHER
WALKED OUT ON HER,

12:55.166 --> 12:58.041
AND SHE IS
WORKING 3 JOBS
JUST TO PAY HER RENT.

12:58.041 --> 13:00.875
YOU CAN'T FIRE HER, ALEX.
IT WOULD BE IRREDEEMABLE.

13:04.417 --> 13:08.083
I'M SORRY, MARIA.
I REALLY AM.

13:08.083 --> 13:10.417

WOW. THAT'S A SHOCK.

33:26.917 --> 33:30.333
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE,
THOUGH, WHEN YOU
THINK ABOUT IT.

33:30.333 --> 33:33.125
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

33:33.125 --> 33:36.083
THE LAST TIME
HE GOT OUT, HE CAME
BACK INTO YOUR LIFE,

33:36.083 --> 33:38.000
HE TURNED EVERYTHING
INTO A COMPLETE DISASTER.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.417
IF HE LOVES YOU,
WHICH HE DOES,

33:40.417 --> 33:43.166
THEN IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE
THAT HE WOULDN'T WANNA...

33:43.166 --> 33:45.500
REPEAT THAT AGAIN.

33:45.500 --> 33:46.959
YOU'RE RIGHT.

33:46.959 --> 33:49.041
IT'S JUST...

33:49.041 --> 33:49.625
SAD.

33:49.625 --> 33:52.041
YEAH, IT IS.

33:52.041 --> 33:53.291
BUT, UM...

33:53.291 --> 33:57.083
COULD WE TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE?

33:57.083 --> 33:58.291
SURE.
UM...

33:58.291 --> 34:00.750
SURE. WHAT DO YOU
WANNA TALK ABOUT?

34:00.750 --> 34:02.417
AUDREY SORT OF...

34:02.417 --> 34:06.959
INDICATED THAT YOU
HAD SOMETHING
TO TELL ME.

34:06.959 --> 34:09.542
YEAH.

34:09.542 --> 34:10.875
IT'S KINDA WEIRD,

34:10.875 --> 34:12.875
'CAUSE IT'S
A REALLY GOOD THING.

34:12.875 --> 34:15.250
I WANT YOU TO BE
AS EXCITED ABOUT IT
AS I AM,

34:15.250 --> 34:17.542
BUT I'M NOT SURE
THAT RIGHT NOW'S
THE BEST TIME.

34:17.542 --> 34:19.417
NO, NO. NOW'S FINE.

34:19.417 --> 34:20.708
I WANNA HEAR IT.
I...

34:20.708 --> 34:22.708
TELL ME.

34:25.417 --> 34:27.083
HERE GOES.

34:27.083 --> 34:30.333
THIS PRODUCER...
THIS REALLY BIG PRODUCER

34:30.333 --> 34:32.500
SAW OUR MOVIE,
AND HE LIKED IT.

34:32.500 --> 34:33.958
HE LOVED IT, ACTUALLY,

34:33.958 --> 34:36.542
AND HE WANTS TO FLY
OLIVER AND ME OUT
TO L.A. THIS SUMMER

34:36.542 --> 34:39.333
TO WORK WITH HIM,
AND HE WANTS TO BE
OUR MENTOR...

34:39.333 --> 34:42.417
YOU KNOW, HELP US
GET OUR FOOT IN THE DOOR.
THAT'S WHAT MY AGENT SAID.

34:42.417 --> 34:45.583
IT COULD BE
A COLOSSAL WASTE OF TIME,
BUT I DON'T THINK SO.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.083
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
I THINK THIS IS...

34:48.083 --> 34:50.708
THE BEGINNING
OF EVERYTHING
I EVER WANTED.

34:52.750 --> 34:53.792
WOW, I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.750
I HAD NO IDEA.

34:55.750 --> 34:56.792
I THOUGHT
YOU SAID AUDREY--

34:56.792 --> 34:57.959
NO, GOD, UM--

34:57.959 --> 35:01.208
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!

35:01.208 --> 35:03.500
I MEAN, I--I CAN'T
REALLY EVEN

35:03.500 --> 35:05.500
MAINTAIN
A COMPLETE THOUGHT.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.792
HAPPY ISN'T
THE RIGHT WORD.

35:07.792 --> 35:09.291
I'M OVERWHELMED.

35:09.291 --> 35:11.458
[CHUCKLING]
I WANTED TO TELL YOU

35:11.458 --> 35:13.417
LIKE THE MOMENT
IT HAPPENED.

35:13.417 --> 35:15.083
I MEAN, YOU KNOW...

35:15.083 --> 35:15.959
YOU'RE THE PERSON
I WANTED TO SHARE THIS WITH

35:15.959 --> 35:18.708
MORE THAN
ANYONE IN THE WORLD.

35:21.959 --> 35:25.375
PRESSURE.
I'M...GONNA SAY
THE WRONG THING.

35:25.375 --> 35:26.542
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

35:26.542 --> 35:29.250
YOU'VE ALREADY SAID
ALL THE RIGHT THINGS.

35:40.125 --> 35:41.583
WELL, CLEARLY...

35:41.583 --> 35:42.583
I'VE GOT PROBLEMS.

35:42.583 --> 35:44.166
[LAUGHS]

35:44.166 --> 35:46.291
YEAH, WE'VE ALL
GOT OUR PROBLEMS.

35:48.750 --> 35:49.834
YEAH, BUT...

35:49.834 --> 35:52.959
I COULD HAVE
KILLED WHOEVER
WAS IN THAT CAR.

35:52.959 --> 35:55.333
I MEAN,
IN AN INSTANT...

35:55.333 --> 35:58.458
MY WHOLE LIFE
COULD HAVE BEEN
CHANGED FOREVER.

36:00.834 --> 36:02.792
BUT IT DIDN'T.

36:02.792 --> 36:05.750
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

36:05.750 --> 36:08.542
SO WHAT'S IT WORTH
TO YA, ALEX?

36:08.542 --> 36:10.667
I'M NOT CAPABLE
OF ANSWERING
YOUR QUESTION

36:10.667 --> 36:15.625
BECAUSE...I HONESTLY
DON'T KNOW WHY I AM
THE WAY I AM.

36:15.625 --> 36:18.250
I MEAN,
DO YOU KNOW WHY
YOU'RE SO GOOD?

36:18.250 --> 36:22.834
THE ONLY THING
I KNOW, ALEX,
IS THAT...

36:22.834 --> 36:25.375
YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE

36:25.375 --> 36:26.500
FEELING SORRY
FOR YOURSELF.

36:28.917 --> 36:30.750
NO MATTER WHAT'S
HAPPENED TO YOU.

36:30.750 --> 36:32.333
I BELIEVE THAT.

36:32.333 --> 36:34.750
AND ALSO
THAT IT'S NEVER
TOO LATE.

36:34.750 --> 36:37.250
FOR WHAT?

36:37.250 --> 36:39.708
TO TRY AND...

36:39.708 --> 36:41.375
MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

36:47.208 --> 36:50.166
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE SADDEST PART IS?

36:50.166 --> 36:51.792
YEAH. YOU TOTALLY
MESSED UP YOUR PORSCHE.

36:51.792 --> 36:54.708
HA HA HA.

36:54.708 --> 36:56.333
NAW, IT'S A RENTAL.

36:59.041 --> 37:01.250
SO WHAT'S
THE SADDEST THING?

37:03.875 --> 37:06.041
I REALLY DO LIKE YOU.

37:07.500 --> 37:07.875
HA.

37:07.875 --> 37:09.917
OH.

37:18.875 --> 37:20.542
YEAH, I KNOW.

37:20.542 --> 37:22.041
YEAH, I DO.

37:22.041 --> 37:25.417
OK. I WILL.
I'LL TALK TO YOU
LATER.

37:26.458 --> 37:27.625
GOOD-BYE.

37:41.250 --> 37:44.917
YOU KNOW THOSE MOMENTS
WHEN YOU TOTALLY
DON'T WANNA CRY, BUT...

37:44.917 --> 37:47.917
YOU'RE NOT QUITE SURE
WHAT ELSE TO DO?

37:47.917 --> 37:49.792
WHAT HAPPENED?

37:49.792 --> 37:51.875
[SIGHS]

37:51.875 --> 37:53.875
I TALKED TO THEM.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.417
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

37:59.500 --> 38:01.166
I SAID...

38:01.166 --> 38:03.750
THAT I APPRECIATED
THEIR INVITATION
THIS SUMMER,

38:03.750 --> 38:06.417
BUT THAT I HAD ALREADY
MADE OTHER PLANS.

38:06.417 --> 38:07.417
WHAT'D THEY SAY?

38:11.041 --> 38:12.875
THEY ASKED ME
TO RECONSIDER,

38:12.875 --> 38:15.625
AND I SAID NO,
AND, UH...

38:16.708 --> 38:19.583
THEY SORT OF
SOUNDED RELIEVED.

38:22.125 --> 38:24.792
DID I DO THE RIGHT
THING?

38:24.792 --> 38:26.834
LOOK, I LOVE YOU
VERY MUCH,

38:26.834 --> 38:28.417
BUT...

38:28.417 --> 38:31.291
I CAN'T TELL YOU
THAT I BELIEVE YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING

38:31.291 --> 38:32.542
BECAUSE...I'D BE LYING.

38:32.542 --> 38:34.750
I WON'T DO THAT.

38:34.750 --> 38:36.875
WELL, THEN, DON'T.

38:39.333 --> 38:40.375
WHAT'D I MISS?

38:40.375 --> 38:43.166
WELL...SHE'S NOT
GOING WITH HER PARENTS.

38:43.166 --> 38:45.625
SHE WANTS TO GO
TO COSTA RICA.

38:45.625 --> 38:47.917
AND JACK DOESN'T THINK
THAT I'M DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

38:47.917 --> 38:49.959
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

38:51.917 --> 38:53.625
OH, WELL...

38:53.625 --> 38:56.000
I COULDN'T
SAY. I...

38:57.792 --> 39:00.834
YOUR PARENTS
HAVE NOT BEEN VERY
GENEROUS WITH YOU.

39:00.834 --> 39:02.792
IN FACT,
THEY'VE BEEN CHEAP.

39:05.417 --> 39:08.792
I DON'T THINK
THIS INVITATION
ABSOLVES THEM OF THAT.

39:08.792 --> 39:10.667
OF COURSE NOT,
BUT I MEAN--

39:10.667 --> 39:11.041
I WASN'T FINISHED.

39:11.041 --> 39:13.291
SORRY.

39:13.291 --> 39:16.041
THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN JENNIFER
AND HER PARENTS

39:16.041 --> 39:17.333
IS MUCH MORE
COMPLICATED

39:17.333 --> 39:19.625
THAN YOU AND I
COULD EVEN
BEGIN TO IMAGINE.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.625
IT MAY WELL BE
UNSALVAGEABLE.

39:27.875 --> 39:30.542
AND WHILE I ADMIRE
YOUR INSTINCTS, JACK,

39:30.542 --> 39:33.792
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD

39:33.792 --> 39:38.083
WHO TRULY KNOWS
WHAT'S WORTHWHILE HERE
AND WHAT'S NOT.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.959
IF YOUR PARENTS
HAVE TRULY FOUND
A WAY TO LOVE YOU,

39:51.959 --> 39:55.041
THIS WON'T BE THEIR
LAST OPPORTUNITY
TO PROVE IT.

40:27.166 --> 40:28.917
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

40:31.166 --> 40:34.250
I GOT A LOT TO TELL YA,

40:34.250 --> 40:36.917
I'VE BEEN BUSY,
WHICH IS GOOD, I THINK.

40:36.917 --> 40:39.125
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
I LOST MY VIRGINITY.

40:39.125 --> 40:41.458
IT WAS JEN.

40:42.750 --> 40:45.917
BELIEVE THAT?
AFTER ALL THAT,
IT WAS JEN.

40:45.917 --> 40:47.875
I MADE A MOVIE
WITH A STRANGE GUY

40:47.875 --> 40:51.625
I MET UP AT THAT
FILM FESTIVAL IN HOOKSET.

40:51.625 --> 40:52.166
AND, UH...

40:52.166 --> 40:54.834
WE GOT AN AGENT.

40:54.834 --> 40:58.083
AND NOW THERE'S THIS GUY
IN HOLLYWOOD WHO WANTS US
TO FLY OUT THERE

40:58.083 --> 40:59.542
AND WORK WITH HIM
ALL SUMMER.

40:59.542 --> 41:03.125
SO I'LL FINALLY GET TO
USE THAT PLANE TICKET
THAT YOU BOUGHT ME.

41:03.125 --> 41:05.125
I GUESS THERE'S...
SOME SYMMETRY TO THAT.

41:05.125 --> 41:09.000
THE REAL THING I WANNA
TALK TO YOU ABOUT IS, UH...

41:09.000 --> 41:11.083
JOEY POTTER.

41:11.083 --> 41:14.125
I MEAN, IS IT STILL OK
AFTER EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED

41:14.125 --> 41:17.083
TO BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING
PERFECT IS POSSIBLE?

41:17.083 --> 41:19.625
I WANT TO BE WITH HER.

41:19.625 --> 41:22.125
I LOVE HER.

41:35.458 --> 41:36.917
OK. [SNIFFS]

41:36.917 --> 41:39.291
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
