00:21.888 --> 00:24.686
Don't want you to think
of this as just a film...

00:24.858 --> 00:28.294
...some process of converting
electrons and magnetic impulses...

00:28.461 --> 00:30.520
...into shapes and figures
and sounds.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.665
No. Listen to me.

00:32.832 --> 00:36.666
We're here to make
a dent in the universe.

00:36.836 --> 00:38.963
Otherwise, why even be here?

00:39.139 --> 00:41.664
We're creating a completely
new consciousness...

00:41.841 --> 00:44.571
...like an artist or a poet.

00:44.744 --> 00:46.575
That's how you have to think of this.

00:46.746 --> 00:49.909
We're rewriting the history of human
thought with what we're doing.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.574
Right. Well, Steven, at the moment
I'm more worried...

00:52.752 --> 00:56.483
...about getting light on the actress.
You know what I mean?

00:59.225 --> 01:01.125
Simon. Excuse me a second.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.467
- Michelle.
- Yeah?

01:08.635 --> 01:11.195
Michelle, walk...
Yes, walk towards lens slowly.

01:11.371 --> 01:13.032
Like this?

01:14.307 --> 01:17.799
Okay. Right. Right.

01:28.488 --> 01:31.514
<i>I always wondered what it
must have been like for Steve.</i>

01:31.691 --> 01:34.387
I mean, ever since we were kids,
everything he ever did...

01:34.561 --> 01:38.224
...was somewhere between a religious
experience and some sort of crusade.

01:38.498 --> 01:39.795
<i>Like with this commercial.</i>

01:39.966 --> 01:43.299
<i>It was practically a legend
from the time Ridley Scott filmed it.</i>

01:43.470 --> 01:46.132
<i>Like the book, 1984,
with all the downtrodden masses...</i>

01:46.306 --> 01:48.797
<i>...and that one huge spark
of rebellion...</i>

01:48.975 --> 01:52.240
<i>...against the evil Big Brother
who ran everything.</i>

01:53.513 --> 01:54.946
Go, go, go.

01:55.882 --> 01:57.713
Smoke it up, please.

01:58.718 --> 02:00.948
And you three.
That's right, you'll come with me.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.555
The rest of you stay in the back.

02:19.405 --> 02:23.341
<i>- is a more powerful weapon
than any fleet or army on Earth.</i>

02:24.010 --> 02:27.002
<i>We are one people with one will.</i>

02:27.180 --> 02:30.513
<i>One resolve. One cause.</i>

02:30.750 --> 02:33.241
<i>Our enemies shall talk
themselves to death...</i>

02:33.419 --> 02:38.015
<i>...and we will bury them
with their own confusion.</i>

02:38.191 --> 02:41.456
<i>We shall prevail.</i>

02:46.132 --> 02:47.531
<i>And then 13 years later...</i>

02:47.700 --> 02:50.897
<i>...Steve has to stand up
on that stage in Boston.</i>

02:51.070 --> 02:52.560
<i>Man, that was...</i>

02:52.739 --> 02:54.434
<i>That was weird.</i>

02:54.908 --> 02:56.705
The era...

02:56.943 --> 03:00.936
...of competition between us is over.

03:02.215 --> 03:04.046
Thank you, Bill.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.576
Thank you for standing with us.

03:06.753 --> 03:09.221
The world's a better place
because of it.

03:09.389 --> 03:11.914
Microsoft is gonna ruin Apple.
You can't trust them.

03:12.091 --> 03:13.581
I know.

03:13.760 --> 03:18.459
I realize that this news
may be shocking to some of you.

03:18.631 --> 03:20.997
<i>I mean,
Steve talking to Bill Gates...</i>

03:21.167 --> 03:24.193
<i>...who's staring down
like he's Big Brother, and he was.</i>

03:24.370 --> 03:27.066
<i>For years, Steve almost went crazy
over what Bill was doing to him...</i>

03:27.240 --> 03:30.175
<i>...and now he's up there on that stage,
in front of the world...</i>

03:30.343 --> 03:33.278
<i>...telling everybody he's practically
the Second Coming.</i>

03:34.247 --> 03:36.772
<i>I mean, how do you get
from there to here?</i>

03:44.057 --> 03:45.854
<i>There was a disturbance
on the campus...</i>

03:47.427 --> 03:50.555
<i>...of the University
of California at Berkeley.</i>

03:50.730 --> 03:53.790
<i>The Santa Barbara campus
reported a small-scale riot as well.</i>

03:53.967 --> 03:56.800
<i>- The demonstrators said they were...
- More than 400 students...</i>

03:56.970 --> 03:59.438
<i>...have taken part
in the demonstration.</i>

04:01.674 --> 04:05.508
<i>In the morning, police began launching
tear-gas grenades to break up the crowd.</i>

04:05.678 --> 04:08.613
<i>Student leaders are anxious
to meet with university officials...</i>

04:08.781 --> 04:10.681
<i>...to express their views on Vietnam.</i>

04:11.017 --> 04:14.111
- What the hell are we doing here?
- Let's get out of here.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.154
Stay back. Hold it.
Hold it there. Get back.

04:50.089 --> 04:52.080
- Don't drop the box!
- I'm not!

04:52.258 --> 04:53.725
Come on.

05:04.871 --> 05:06.361
You okay?

05:06.706 --> 05:08.833
Those guys think
they're revolutionaries.

05:09.008 --> 05:10.737
- They're not. We are.
- We are?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.211
<i>You know, Steve was
never like you or me.</i>

05:13.379 --> 05:16.678
<i>He always saw things differently.
Even then when I was in Berkeley...</i>

05:16.849 --> 05:19.875
<i>...I'd see something and just see
kilobytes or circuit boards...</i>

05:20.053 --> 05:23.079
<i>...while he'd see karma or the meaning
of the universe.</i>

05:24.490 --> 05:28.688
<i>Steve and I found this weird guy
who was a hero around Berkeley...</i>

05:28.861 --> 05:31.091
<i>...all because he found a way
to beat the system.</i>

05:31.264 --> 05:33.198
<i>This guy was called Captain Crunch...</i>

05:33.366 --> 05:36.995
...because he figured out
this little whistle...

05:37.170 --> 05:39.604
...that you found in boxes
of Cap'n Crunch cereal...

05:39.772 --> 05:42.969
...had the same tones as AT&T's
long-distance equipment.

05:43.476 --> 05:46.343
<i>So you got free phone calls
anywhere in the world...</i>

05:46.512 --> 05:48.878
<i>...with this thing I built
called the blue box.</i>

05:49.048 --> 05:51.175
<i>And then we tested it out
by calling the pope.</i>

05:51.351 --> 05:52.682
- You talk to him.
- No, no, no.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.683
They're putting you
through to the pope?

05:54.854 --> 05:57.322
I totally figured it out, man.

05:57.790 --> 06:01.226
I figured it out. I know what it's about.
You know what it's about?

06:02.495 --> 06:04.395
It's about power.

06:04.564 --> 06:06.327
Right on, man.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.259
It's like those weird countries...

06:08.434 --> 06:11.096
...where the army guys
overthrow the president.

06:11.270 --> 06:13.295
The first thing that they take over...

06:13.473 --> 06:17.933
...are the ways people communicate,
you know, radio, TV, newspapers.

06:18.511 --> 06:19.842
Far-out, man.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.610
Information is power.

06:25.918 --> 06:28.512
<i>I kept building the boxes,
and Steve kept selling them...</i>

06:28.688 --> 06:31.316
<i>...until one day, we almost
got busted by some cops...</i>

06:31.491 --> 06:35.188
<i>...who, thank God, didn't even
know what a blue box was.</i>

06:37.497 --> 06:40.261
You might wanna try a haircut, boys.

06:40.933 --> 06:44.733
<i>So I started trying to build something
that wasn't gonna get us in trouble.</i>

06:45.238 --> 06:47.365
- That's not a blue box.
- It's a computer.

06:47.540 --> 06:50.065
Woz, we need blue boxes,
not computers.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.212
<i>- I got a reporter from Mercury News coming.
- What for?</i>

06:53.379 --> 06:57.315
My mom phoned, told them I was building
a computer, and they wanna do a story.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.041
Woz, give me a break.

06:59.218 --> 07:02.654
Hey, let me ask you something,
seriously. Look at me.

07:02.822 --> 07:05.882
Do you wanna get stuck here
the rest of your life in this hellhole?

07:06.058 --> 07:09.152
Look, this is where I grew up, okay?
It's not a hellhole. Shoot.

07:09.328 --> 07:12.126
I know your newspaper will find
Steve's computer fascinating.

07:12.298 --> 07:14.698
He's so ingenious.
He built it all from spare parts.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.425
Steven, the reporter is...

07:18.171 --> 07:20.002
Hi. It caught fire.

07:20.173 --> 07:24.132
My first chance at fame,
and the computer catches fire.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.278
Sorry.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.683
<i>When I was still at Berkeley...</i>

07:31.851 --> 07:33.842
<i>...I kept making
weird electronic gadgets...</i>

07:34.020 --> 07:36.648
<i>...that were basically just jokes.</i>

07:38.090 --> 07:40.923
<i>But, hey, you know, jokes are important.</i>

07:46.165 --> 07:49.225
<i>The problem back then was
me and Steve and his girlfriend...</i>

07:49.402 --> 07:50.630
<i>...were pretty much broke.</i>

07:50.803 --> 07:54.671
<i>So we ended up doing some pretty
nutty things just to make money.</i>

07:54.841 --> 07:56.433
I know where we can get a job.

07:56.609 --> 07:59.237
- Saw it on the bulletin board there.
- What kind of job?

07:59.412 --> 08:01.937
I don't know. It seems
sort of like show business.

08:02.415 --> 08:06.715
<i>Dressing up as Alice in Wonderland
and stuff for a bunch of kids?</i>

08:09.489 --> 08:12.458
<i>But, you know, Steve wasn't
exactly cut out for that stuff.</i>

08:18.764 --> 08:20.459
Maybe in a past life...

08:20.633 --> 08:23.363
...I was a poet or an artist.

08:23.536 --> 08:27.529
You know, maybe you talk about
past lives and all that stuff...

08:27.707 --> 08:29.766
...because, well,
you don't know who you are.

08:30.877 --> 08:33.778
What the hell are you talking about?
I don't know who I am?

08:34.212 --> 08:36.477
Well, you don't.
I mean, you told me...

08:36.649 --> 08:39.082
I don't wanna talk about it
with you or anyone else.

08:39.485 --> 08:41.419
I'm just trying to help.

08:47.994 --> 08:50.554
It wasn't like Steve and I
lost touch with each other...

08:50.730 --> 08:52.960
...but he was definitely
in places I wasn't...

08:53.499 --> 08:55.091
...like some ashram in India...

08:55.268 --> 08:58.795
...and communes up in Oregon
where they picked apples all day.

08:59.238 --> 09:01.138
<i>It was pretty much
of a journey for Steve.</i>

09:01.307 --> 09:04.276
<i>The kind that's as much
on the inside as on the outside.</i>

09:04.443 --> 09:08.106
<i>I mean, he definitely must
have been to weird places.</i>

09:16.789 --> 09:18.347
See the new Playmate?
Miss October?

09:19.926 --> 09:22.520
Hey, man, Miss August is way better.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.424
Boobs out to here.

09:24.597 --> 09:27.794
Honest to God, Ballmer.
You have no culture.

09:28.434 --> 09:32.336
Yeah, right.
Like you go around reading Plato.

09:33.372 --> 09:34.805
You're the only guy I know...

09:34.974 --> 09:37.772
<i>...who could make furniture
out of Playboys, for God sakes.</i>

09:37.944 --> 09:40.174
Look, you got enough
to make a chair.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.571
You don't have to worry
about them moving...

09:42.748 --> 09:44.773
...because they're stuck together.
- Get out.

09:44.951 --> 09:47.351
<i>- They're all stuck together.
- Sometimes back then...</i>

09:47.520 --> 09:49.112
<i>...I could've throttled Bill Gates.</i>

09:49.288 --> 09:52.121
The guy could turn any human situation
into a poker game.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.225
Forget about classes. Poker.

09:54.393 --> 09:57.191
The fact that the world might
end tonight? No problem, poker.

09:57.363 --> 10:00.264
Or we're finally deciphering
the meaning of life.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.730
More poker.

10:01.901 --> 10:04.028
<i>And winning. The guy'd have
a hairball if he'd lost...</i>

10:04.203 --> 10:06.000
<i>...which wasn't often,
let me tell you.</i>

10:06.172 --> 10:08.504
- Full house.
- Oh, man.

10:09.842 --> 10:11.400
Hey, Bill.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.305
<i>Our rooms were like a casino.</i>

10:14.880 --> 10:16.643
<i>Actually, a messy casino.</i>

10:16.816 --> 10:20.081
<i>And Bill slept wherever he fell down.</i>

10:25.324 --> 10:28.157
Bill, the revolution's starting
without us.

10:28.327 --> 10:31.296
<i>Bill and Paul Allen had known
each other since they were kids.</i>

10:31.464 --> 10:33.694
<i>If the word "passion"
entered into their lives...</i>

10:33.866 --> 10:35.993
<i>...it was for one thing: Computers.</i>

10:36.168 --> 10:40.002
<i>Especially this one made by some guy
in Albuquerque of all places.</i>

10:41.107 --> 10:43.598
What is this, porn for engineers?

10:44.677 --> 10:46.838
Oh, jeez, the Altair.

10:47.413 --> 10:49.108
Am I missing something?

10:49.281 --> 10:53.081
I mean, Miss October, I can understand,
but what is this?

10:53.586 --> 10:55.986
This is better than Miss October.

10:57.757 --> 10:58.985
This is a computer.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.251
- Oh, God.
- The article says...

11:01.427 --> 11:04.191
...that they need someone
to figure out a language for it.

11:04.363 --> 11:07.389
Right now
it just sits there and blinks.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.765
Whoever talks to this Ed Roberts
has gotta go to Albuquerque to see him.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.966
You should go because you look
better for that stuff than I do.

11:18.477 --> 11:20.445
- I do not.
- You both look terrible.

11:20.613 --> 11:23.047
- Just get used to it.
- What are we supposed to do?

11:23.215 --> 11:26.241
It's simple.
You call him and say you're Paul.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.979
And then Paul goes to Albuquerque
and says he's Paul.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.229
So, what are you gonna say?

11:40.633 --> 11:42.692
Hi, Mr. Ed Roberts, please.

11:43.002 --> 11:46.768
This is Paul Allen, calling
from Cambridge, Massachusetts.

11:48.674 --> 11:52.007
It's our job to find out what this guy
doesn't know that he needs...

11:52.511 --> 11:55.173
...but does need and make sure
he knows he does need it...

11:55.347 --> 11:57.872
...and that we're the only ones
to give him the answer.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.540
What?

12:01.353 --> 12:04.345
- Mr. Roberts?
- Yes, sir, Mr. Allen.

12:04.523 --> 12:08.323
I tell you, I believe that we've
got one hot product here.

12:08.494 --> 12:11.930
The reason I can speak that way is
because I've taken over 50 calls...

12:12.098 --> 12:15.295
...from people wanting to come to
work with us on this Altair project.

12:16.869 --> 12:18.894
So here's the deal.

12:19.605 --> 12:22.597
I snuck two women into my room.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.941
And they're naked.

12:25.111 --> 12:27.511
I mean, like, really naked.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.548
You know, like, gorgeous naked.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.943
So don't say I never
did anything for you...

12:35.121 --> 12:37.919
...because they're waiting
for you right now.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.357
Drop dead, Ballmer.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.824
Oh, and I told them...

12:42.995 --> 12:45.759
...that you were writing
a computer language...

12:45.931 --> 12:48.399
...and right away,
they start moaning for it.

12:48.567 --> 12:51.229
"Oh, computer languages.

12:51.403 --> 12:52.768
Oh, Fortran.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.907
Oh, Fortran. "

12:57.810 --> 12:59.334
Will you cut it out, Steve.

12:59.512 --> 13:03.812
Excuse me, I'm just trying
to save you guys from...

13:04.350 --> 13:07.217
...wasting your entire
Harvard reading week...

13:07.386 --> 13:10.378
...over this Traf-O-Data simulator...

13:10.556 --> 13:14.652
...while everyone else
is out getting drunk or laid.

13:15.895 --> 13:18.455
- Paul, are those parts binary?
- I give up. I give up.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.223
I give up. I give up.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.235
Oh, duck, Bill.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.750
Oh, you know, Bill, I think you gotta
come up with a better pickup line.

14:13.919 --> 14:16.979
Asking her what her SAT score is
is definitely not gonna do it.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.087
I forgot to write a loader.

14:19.258 --> 14:21.055
That's not an improvement, Bill.

14:21.260 --> 14:24.388
No, no. I just realized something.
Paul's on his way to Albuquerque.

14:24.563 --> 14:27.726
I forgot to write the loader that connects
the computer to the Teletype.

14:28.067 --> 14:31.400
<i>And if he starts that machine,
and it can't read the tape, we're dead.</i>

14:35.941 --> 14:38.273
Unless he did it on the plane,
I'm finished.

14:38.444 --> 14:40.742
- It's something I just realized.
- I hope so.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.106
If this Albuquerque thing had worked,
I was gonna quit Harvard.

14:45.317 --> 14:46.841
Are you crazy?

14:47.519 --> 14:49.453
I gotta be a doctor or something.

14:52.758 --> 14:55.158
Gynecologist, maybe.

14:56.028 --> 14:57.256
- Come on.
- I'm flying.

14:57.429 --> 14:59.226
Yeah, you're flying.

14:59.498 --> 15:01.090
- Here we go.
- Ballmer.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.335
You're the only guy I know
who pays the strippers...

15:05.504 --> 15:07.472
...to put their clothes on.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.836
Come on, drunkie.

15:17.716 --> 15:19.183
Okay.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.588
Hey, Bill...

15:24.757 --> 15:27.089
...it's either the clothes or you,
but something...

15:27.259 --> 15:29.022
...definitely needs to be hosed down.

15:29.194 --> 15:30.991
- Sorry we failed.
- Come on.

15:32.298 --> 15:35.096
- Good night.
- Sorry we failed.

15:37.403 --> 15:40.304
<i>Bill, Bill, Bill.</i>

15:44.977 --> 15:46.638
<i>Bill, Bill, Bill.</i>

15:56.355 --> 15:57.947
It's an Altair.

15:58.123 --> 16:01.058
They gave it to us as a gift.

16:02.361 --> 16:04.420
We blew them away.

16:09.668 --> 16:11.829
Woz, do we have to have mice?

16:12.004 --> 16:14.097
Come on, I like mice. This is Irving.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.434
Hey, man, you are putting poison
into your body.

16:16.608 --> 16:18.473
Hey, hey, come on.
Give me those.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.169
- That's french fries, man.
- That's what I mean.

16:21.347 --> 16:24.578
French fries, all-American food.
Come on.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.684
I can't eat like you do.

16:26.852 --> 16:29.252
Eating fruit all the time.
That's weird.

16:29.688 --> 16:33.351
It's not weird. It's pure.
Makes the soul pure.

16:33.525 --> 16:37.928
Oh, wait, wait. You gotta listen to this.
I got a great one today.

16:39.098 --> 16:42.295
<i>Did you hear about the drunk who
came staggering out of the subway...</i>

16:42.468 --> 16:45.301
<i>...and said, "Man, I got lost
in some guy's basement.</i>

16:45.471 --> 16:48.531
<i>You should've seen the set
of trains he had"?</i>

16:51.276 --> 16:55.144
<i>- the Bay Area Dial-a-Joke Line,
making your day a barrel of laughs.</i>

16:55.314 --> 16:56.906
I got a new book of Polish jokes.

16:57.082 --> 16:59.107
Man, it'll keep me going for years.

16:59.284 --> 17:01.275
- Why?
- Why?

17:01.453 --> 17:03.478
It makes people laugh.

17:03.655 --> 17:07.318
I got people phoning in every day
just to hear my latest joke.

17:07.492 --> 17:08.721
It makes their day better.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.855
Are you sure this thing's
gonna work?

17:11.030 --> 17:13.224
- Lf it doesn't catch fire.
- Don't even joke.

17:13.898 --> 17:15.695
I like jokes.

17:16.734 --> 17:17.963
Jokes make me feel good.

17:26.912 --> 17:29.574
You know, I hired
a private detective today.

17:32.151 --> 17:34.176
I wanna find my mother.

17:34.620 --> 17:35.985
My real mother.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.419
You never talk about that stuff
with me.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.484
That part about being adopted and all.

17:41.660 --> 17:45.027
Guy says he can probably find her.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.865
Why do you always get freaked
out when Arlene asks about it?

17:49.034 --> 17:51.832
Arlene? Arlene's got her own problems.

17:52.004 --> 17:56.338
My parents don't want her in the house.
She phones me a million times a day.

17:58.444 --> 18:01.140
At least I'm working on my stuff.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.752
Feel better?

18:19.998 --> 18:22.865
Now, Steve, tell the others
what you're feeling.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.267
Like...

18:28.073 --> 18:30.769
- Like it's gone.
- What is?

18:31.577 --> 18:33.238
The anger.

18:34.179 --> 18:36.340
Like the anger's gone.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.675
It's gone.

18:57.069 --> 19:00.266
<i>Back then, our big thrill was going to
this thing they called the Homebrew Club.</i>

19:00.439 --> 19:02.566
<i>It was where guys
spent all their spare time...</i>

19:02.741 --> 19:05.938
<i>...trying to get access to computers
owned by the local corporations.</i>

19:06.111 --> 19:09.171
<i>And people would go there
and show the stuff they just built.</i>

19:09.348 --> 19:11.839
<i>Except most of it
didn't really work all that well.</i>

19:12.017 --> 19:15.783
<i>- Read in the Popular Electronics
issue about a year ago...</i>

19:15.954 --> 19:18.718
...about the new Altair 8800.

19:18.891 --> 19:22.554
<i>I was nervous that day we walked
in with my homemade computer...</i>

19:22.861 --> 19:25.125
<i>...but I got a charge out of it.
All those guys...</i>

19:25.297 --> 19:27.925
<i>...coming over and wanting
to talk to me.</i>

19:30.969 --> 19:32.869
The schematics we have...

19:33.038 --> 19:34.835
- What is this thing?
- Check it out.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.907
The first computer
you're ever gonna see.

19:37.075 --> 19:38.474
What's the screen for?

19:38.644 --> 19:41.169
<i>I was never good at talking
to people in those days...</i>

19:41.346 --> 19:44.543
<i>...but Steve, he was amazing.</i>

19:44.716 --> 19:48.709
Alexander Graham Bell when he heard his
first ring, that's as revolutionary as this is.

19:48.887 --> 19:52.516
He's talking about the Altair? I never
had a problem till I tried to use it.

19:52.691 --> 19:56.252
<i>All of a sudden we found out what
we wanted to do with our lives.</i>

19:56.428 --> 19:58.828
<i>- It was all we ever wanted.
- To 30.</i>

19:58.997 --> 20:02.057
Here is the first personal computer
that you're gonna wanna buy.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.235
Man, 50! We sold 50.

20:09.408 --> 20:12.400
IBM is gonna be
loading in their pants.

20:12.578 --> 20:14.512
I don't even think
IBM knows who we are.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.046
Good. This is guerrilla warfare.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.912
- They're the enemy.
- They are?

20:20.085 --> 20:24.317
I used to think maybe Steve was
born obsessed with wiping out IBM.

20:24.489 --> 20:25.956
And in a way, you could see why.

20:26.124 --> 20:28.649
I mean, in those days,
as far as we were concerned...

20:28.827 --> 20:31.193
...IBM was practically
like the Pentagon.

20:33.332 --> 20:36.062
<i>Here were a bunch of guys
who dressed exactly the same...</i>

20:36.235 --> 20:37.532
<i>...and sang company songs.</i>

20:46.111 --> 20:47.942
<i>I mean, we were
these scruffy crazies...</i>

20:48.113 --> 20:52.277
<i>...messing around with computer stuff
the IBM guys thought was, like, toys.</i>

20:52.451 --> 20:54.282
<i>But what did they know?</i>

21:00.892 --> 21:03.224
- Where's your VW?
- Sold it.

21:03.595 --> 21:07.691
1350 bucks. We're on our way.

21:07.866 --> 21:09.595
- Steve.
- What?

21:09.768 --> 21:12.566
- What's the problem?
- I don't know if I can build these.

21:12.738 --> 21:15.707
Hey, Woz, I assume we're speaking
the same language, right?

21:15.874 --> 21:18.934
Dan, Elizabeth,
I'm not speaking Swahili, am I?

21:19.244 --> 21:21.508
I'm here to inform you
our universe is unfolding...

21:21.680 --> 21:23.705
But I still don't think
I can build them.

21:23.882 --> 21:25.611
I work for Hewlett-Packard sometimes.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.513
- Yeah, and?
- My dad pointed it out...

21:27.686 --> 21:29.881
...they get first chance
in anything I invent.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.189
- What?
- I can't help it.

21:32.357 --> 21:34.257
It's on the paper I signed.

21:34.426 --> 21:37.759
Damn it, Woz!
We get our shot, our destiny...

21:37.929 --> 21:40.591
...and now we gotta turn it
all over to these businessmen?

21:59.217 --> 22:02.880
Steve. It is Steve, isn't it?

22:03.889 --> 22:06.858
Yeah. Steve, you say
that this gadget of yours...

22:07.025 --> 22:09.391
...is for ordinary people.

22:10.062 --> 22:13.998
What on earth would ordinary
people want with computers?

22:48.100 --> 22:49.590
What?

22:55.874 --> 22:57.603
What?

22:58.143 --> 23:00.077
They hated it.

23:01.079 --> 23:03.274
They hated it.

23:03.448 --> 23:05.109
They hated it.

23:38.049 --> 23:40.142
Whenever Steve went
to a bank to get a loan...

23:40.318 --> 23:43.845
...it was like they were Eskimos,
and we had a refrigerator to sell them.

23:44.022 --> 23:47.480
<i>Okay, so Steve didn't look
like a business guy. But who did?</i>

23:47.659 --> 23:51.186
<i>Business guys and bankers thought
you'd just barfed on their shoes...</i>

23:51.363 --> 23:54.799
<i>...if you tried to interest them
in computers for ordinary people.</i>

23:54.966 --> 23:56.934
<i>I mean, go figure.</i>

24:43.682 --> 24:44.910
Where's your beard?

24:45.750 --> 24:48.014
In the bathroom. Shaved it off.

24:48.186 --> 24:49.949
Well, how come?

24:51.289 --> 24:53.348
Because banks don't like beards.

24:53.525 --> 24:55.083
So we called ourselves Apple...

24:55.260 --> 24:57.421
...and started making
those little computers.

24:57.596 --> 24:59.655
Me, Steve and his friends
Elizabeth and Dan.

24:59.831 --> 25:02.698
All of us sweating away
in Steve's parents' garage.

25:03.635 --> 25:06.468
It's like sometimes not knowing
how crazy something is...

25:06.638 --> 25:08.105
...is a good thing.

25:08.273 --> 25:09.900
You're just goofing around...

25:10.075 --> 25:13.374
...until someone like Mike
shows up and says, "Wow. "

25:13.545 --> 25:16.241
- Steve Jobs?
- Jobs.

25:16.414 --> 25:18.939
Oh, right. I'm sorry. Mike Markula.

25:19.951 --> 25:22.112
- Hey, Mike. How you doing?
- I'm well.

25:22.287 --> 25:24.312
The man who put intelligence
into Intel.

25:24.489 --> 25:25.717
- Yeah...
- No smoking in here.

25:25.891 --> 25:28.155
Oh, I'm sorry about that. Yeah.

25:28.326 --> 25:30.294
- Valentine said you might call.
- Yeah.

25:30.462 --> 25:33.363
- Welcome to Apple Computers.
- Thank you. Here it is, huh?

25:33.632 --> 25:35.896
I was looking for a venture
opportunity like this.

25:36.234 --> 25:38.702
What kind of venture money
are we talking about, Mike?

25:39.004 --> 25:42.804
We start with about a quarter million
dollars and see what happens.

25:44.309 --> 25:46.174
Excuse me?

25:47.712 --> 25:50.044
Quarter million dollars.
You must be Steve Wozniak.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.773
- Yeah.
- Mike Markula.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.880
A quarter million dollars into this?

25:54.052 --> 25:56.213
- Yep.
- What's the catch?

25:57.289 --> 25:59.723
- No catch, just business.
- That's the catch...

25:59.891 --> 26:01.552
...because this ain't just business.

26:01.826 --> 26:04.954
This is practically spiritual.

26:05.130 --> 26:07.189
This is about overthrowing dead culture.

26:09.367 --> 26:11.597
- Dead gods.
- Okay, look.

26:11.770 --> 26:15.103
You guys wanna be operating out
of a garage, that's fine with me.

26:15.273 --> 26:17.707
But this is a ground-zero operation here.

26:17.876 --> 26:20.401
Steve Wozniak's employee number one.
You're number two.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.240
Wait a minute.

26:23.448 --> 26:25.439
I'm employee number one.

26:25.617 --> 26:27.778
- Woz?
- Doesn't matter to me.

26:27.953 --> 26:30.387
- I'm employee number one.
- I'm not saying anything.

26:30.555 --> 26:32.887
- I wasn't implying anything.
- Then I'll be zero.

26:33.058 --> 26:35.822
- Woz, you can be number one.
- I'll be zero. Okay?

26:35.994 --> 26:38.155
<i>Even though things
were changing like crazy...</i>

26:38.330 --> 26:40.594
<i>...venture capitalists
and bankers and all that...</i>

26:40.765 --> 26:43.529
<i>...some things still stayed the same,
especially with Steve.</i>

26:43.702 --> 26:46.227
- I don't want it, Steve.
- It'll make you nice.

26:47.305 --> 26:49.603
Woz, you and me.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.572
This is your mother telling you
to drop this beautiful acid...

26:52.744 --> 26:54.541
Your mother wouldn't approve either.

26:54.713 --> 26:57.341
- Get that away from me. "Man. "
- Man, come on.

26:57.682 --> 26:59.047
I'd be careful.

26:59.217 --> 27:01.549
Baby, it's you and me.
Take a little trip?

27:01.720 --> 27:03.017
- No, thanks, Steve.
- Come on.

27:03.188 --> 27:05.486
- Steve, no.
- What's the matter with you guys?

27:06.024 --> 27:10.222
It's like living with a bunch
of squares and stiffs.

27:11.096 --> 27:12.358
More for me.

27:14.566 --> 27:18.696
Oh, I'm standing.
I'm standing in front of something.

27:18.870 --> 27:21.395
It's a field of wheat.

27:21.706 --> 27:24.937
<i>Oh, and I hear classical music playing.
Do you hear it?</i>

27:25.110 --> 27:26.372
<i>Do you hear it?</i>

27:26.544 --> 27:30.207
<i>I'm conducting classical music!</i>

27:34.119 --> 27:37.054
Everything's moving with the wind.

27:37.222 --> 27:40.316
Everything's moving with the wind.

27:49.934 --> 27:53.802
Everything's moving
just the way I want it to.

27:53.972 --> 27:55.940
Everything.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.556
Steve.

28:15.593 --> 28:17.060
Hey...

28:17.696 --> 28:19.823
...how am I gonna get home?

28:30.442 --> 28:32.672
- It's not bad when there's no wind.
- Yeah?

28:32.844 --> 28:34.471
What is that?

28:38.083 --> 28:40.950
Bring down a pallet with six more.

28:46.925 --> 28:49.587
- Oh, man.
- What?

28:49.761 --> 28:53.219
I was just thinking about Harvard.
It'll pass.

28:54.132 --> 28:55.793
Hey, Paul.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.959
Right on schedule.
How you doing?

28:59.137 --> 29:01.867
- Good to see you.
- Hi, Ed.

29:03.508 --> 29:05.066
So...

29:05.844 --> 29:08.108
...are you...? Are you Bill?

29:08.279 --> 29:09.507
Are you Ed?

29:11.249 --> 29:13.410
Well, I'll be damned.

29:21.025 --> 29:23.050
Signing bonus?

29:25.063 --> 29:28.430
I've never given a signing bonus
in all my life.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.797
You know, Ed, in our other contracts,
we always get a signing bonus.

29:31.970 --> 29:34.996
- Other contracts?
- Yeah, our other contracts.

29:35.173 --> 29:37.038
Well, I don't know.

29:37.208 --> 29:39.142
I don't know.

29:49.087 --> 29:50.645
Okay.

29:51.089 --> 29:53.023
- Two thousand.
- Four thousand.

29:53.324 --> 29:55.258
- What?
- Of course.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.961
Next, Ed, this business
of a $ 15 royalty...

29:58.129 --> 30:01.656
...for BASIC sold in every 4K Altair,
it's just not acceptable.

30:01.833 --> 30:04.927
Let me tell you something, boy.
This ain't the way I do business.

30:05.103 --> 30:08.163
And I especially don't like
being dictated to by some little...

30:08.339 --> 30:10.830
Ed, Ed, this is not about dictating.

30:11.009 --> 30:13.569
You see, this is about reality.

30:13.745 --> 30:18.842
The reality is that your machine is
brilliant, but it needs our language.

30:19.017 --> 30:22.043
And without it, you know,
it's just a tin box that lights up.

30:25.757 --> 30:29.557
So let's double our royalty
from $ 15 to $30 a copy.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.059
<i>So back then I get postcards
from these guys.</i>

30:38.236 --> 30:41.467
<i>"Wish you were here," and all that.
Yeah, right, Albuquerque.</i>

30:41.639 --> 30:43.869
<i>Bill and Paul were living
in this crummy motel...</i>

30:44.042 --> 30:47.671
<i>...acting like they had a clue about
being in the computer business.</i>

30:47.846 --> 30:49.609
- Eureka.
- What?

30:49.781 --> 30:52.875
I created a program
that can play blackjack.

30:53.284 --> 30:56.048
Chris, you've been here two days,
and you're into blackjack?

30:56.221 --> 30:57.916
Yeah, so?

30:58.089 --> 30:59.920
So you got work to do.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.357
Oh, God, no.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.022
Not Frank Sinatra. Not "My Way. "

31:09.200 --> 31:11.134
Not again. Spare us.

31:22.547 --> 31:25.345
So, Paul, I'm putting in $909,
and you're in for 606...

31:25.516 --> 31:27.347
...and we're keeping
the Microsoft name.

31:27.619 --> 31:30.952
You know how you told Ed that
we're leasing whole office buildings?

31:31.122 --> 31:33.386
What if he finds out
our corporate headquarters...

31:33.558 --> 31:36.322
...are in that roach motel
with two student employees?

31:40.164 --> 31:41.563
You think they're hookers?

31:41.833 --> 31:44.165
Either that or motel inspectors.

31:44.335 --> 31:46.769
I saw that one going in and out
of the motel room...

31:46.938 --> 31:49.168
...about a dozen times yesterday.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.872
Oh, baby.

32:02.487 --> 32:05.615
- I quit Harvard for this?
- You wanted glamour.

32:05.790 --> 32:07.587
- You got glamour.
- Come on, baby.

32:07.792 --> 32:12.092
Quit bitching
or else go get us that pizza.

32:13.965 --> 32:15.364
Oh, yeah.

32:19.737 --> 32:22.171
Oh, baby, come on. Yes!

33:04.882 --> 33:09.376
Rise and shine. Wakey wakey.
Your 9:30's here.

33:09.554 --> 33:12.250
You left your MasterCard
in the restaurant again yesterday.

33:12.423 --> 33:15.790
That's the third time this month.
The hotel in Dallas called and said...

33:15.960 --> 33:18.554
...you left your suit in the room
when you checked out.

33:18.730 --> 33:22.757
Hertz called back and said
they will never rent you a car again.

33:22.934 --> 33:25.903
Two more speeding citations in the mail
and wash your hair.

33:26.070 --> 33:29.597
No, comb your hair, wash it later
and change your shirt.

33:32.477 --> 33:34.274
It's over there.

33:40.485 --> 33:44.581
We're here for our 9:30
with your president, Mr. Gates.

33:51.729 --> 33:53.321
Mr...

33:53.498 --> 33:54.795
...Gates?

34:01.339 --> 34:02.567
Hello?

34:02.740 --> 34:07.074
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Paul left a message. He said to tell you...

34:07.245 --> 34:10.737
...if you get thrown in jail again tonight,
you're on your own.

34:10.915 --> 34:14.248
You have to find somebody else
to bail you out.

34:14.418 --> 34:16.216
Okay?

34:19.524 --> 34:23.984
- Jeez, Bill, isn't this Paul's car?
- You know, I figured it out.

34:25.096 --> 34:27.188
Exercise is bad for your health.

34:27.364 --> 34:31.358
You see, if you take a normal pulse rate,
70 per minute...

34:31.536 --> 34:35.027
...times the average life span,
which is 75 years...

34:35.206 --> 34:37.333
- Too fast, Bill. Please.
- Let's see, that's...

34:38.409 --> 34:42.607
...70 times 60 minutes,
times 24 hours, times 365 days.

34:42.780 --> 34:45.078
- Come on, please.
- That's 37 million heartbeats...

34:45.248 --> 34:46.648
...times 75 years.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.045
Slow down.

34:56.293 --> 34:58.558
Hey, Chris. Take a look.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.700
Bill.

35:04.802 --> 35:06.292
No way, man.

35:07.405 --> 35:09.305
Bill.

35:10.775 --> 35:12.174
The keys are in it.

35:12.343 --> 35:14.504
I don't know if this
is such a good idea, Bill.

35:14.679 --> 35:17.910
Can you get off that thing? Come on.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.678
I think you steer with the pedals
and these levers.

35:21.853 --> 35:24.651
No, Bill. Come on. Please.

35:25.156 --> 35:27.056
- Okay, don't worry about it.
- Yeah, right.

35:27.225 --> 35:28.886
On your mark.

35:29.193 --> 35:31.184
Get set.

35:31.362 --> 35:33.227
Go.

35:42.573 --> 35:44.632
You're going down.

35:50.548 --> 35:51.879
No way, man.

35:53.217 --> 35:56.448
<i>Microsoft?
Nobody I knew ever heard of Microsoft...</i>

35:56.621 --> 35:58.953
<i>...or Bill Gates.
I mean, they were nobodies.</i>

35:59.123 --> 36:02.718
But then we were all nobodies,
which was perfect for us...

36:02.894 --> 36:05.692
...because all the respectable,
straight-arrow guys...

36:05.863 --> 36:08.889
...were busy doing what they always do,
which is be respectable...

36:09.066 --> 36:12.263
<i>...which meant the rest of us
could run around acting like crazies...</i>

36:12.436 --> 36:14.768
<i>...which is what we did best.</i>

36:14.939 --> 36:16.702
<i>I miss those days.</i>

36:21.579 --> 36:23.979
A bulldozer?

36:24.148 --> 36:26.810
Who's this Apple Computer?

36:26.984 --> 36:29.214
You hit my car with a bulldozer, Bill?

36:29.754 --> 36:30.982
I'm sorry.

36:31.155 --> 36:34.215
<i>We went looking for someone who had
the kind of software we needed.</i>

36:34.392 --> 36:38.385
<i>The only place we found was this dinky
little company in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</i>

36:38.563 --> 36:42.727
It says Apple wants a contract
for $21,000 to license BASIC.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.061
Do you know what this means, Paul?

36:45.236 --> 36:48.569
Yeah, yeah. It means
that we're desperate for business.

36:48.739 --> 36:51.503
We're nearly bankrupt, and even worse,
we're in Albuquerque.

36:51.676 --> 36:54.338
I just got this car, Bill.
I don't believe you.

36:54.512 --> 36:56.844
- A damn bulldozer?
- I'm sorry.

36:57.014 --> 37:00.814
I think that this means there's something
really going on out there in California.

37:11.128 --> 37:15.189
- Nine forty-five.
- A.M. Or P. M?

37:17.435 --> 37:19.835
Opens in 15 minutes.

37:20.004 --> 37:22.905
I'm so tired I can't see straight.

37:23.341 --> 37:26.401
What if they find out we've only made
three of these computers...

37:26.577 --> 37:29.705
...and we're acting like we got
an assembly line full of the things?

37:29.880 --> 37:32.940
- What then?
- Hey, Woz. No sleeping in the booth, Woz.

37:33.117 --> 37:34.550
You're cluttering up the joint.

37:34.719 --> 37:37.620
Steve, all of a sudden
we're working harder than our fathers...

37:37.788 --> 37:39.881
...who we laughed at
for how hard they worked.

37:40.057 --> 37:43.151
- I don't get it.
- Come on. Still gotta change.

37:43.327 --> 37:44.555
Change what?

37:44.729 --> 37:46.822
<i>Doors will open in 15 minutes.</i>

37:47.265 --> 37:49.893
Oh, my God.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.832
- Steve.
- What?

37:58.509 --> 38:01.342
- What?
- No.

38:01.512 --> 38:07.417
- Like I have to have a mustache?
- A suit. You actually bought a suit.

38:07.985 --> 38:10.249
Two minutes to 10.

38:11.522 --> 38:15.856
- Well, you think anyone will show up?
- How the hell should I know that?

38:16.360 --> 38:20.319
Of course they're gonna show up.
I don't know. Maybe.

38:20.498 --> 38:22.159
Is my tie okay?

38:32.677 --> 38:34.542
There it is.

38:37.348 --> 38:42.012
<i>Unbelievable. It was practically like
being a rock star or something.</i>

38:42.186 --> 38:43.517
<i>People swarming all over you.</i>

38:43.688 --> 38:46.088
<i>Hordes of them coming to see
this amazing machine...</i>

38:46.257 --> 38:49.784
<i>...with 62 chips
and ICs that make all these colors.</i>

38:52.396 --> 38:56.264
Hard plastic, molded casing.
You've never seen this.

39:11.115 --> 39:15.449
- 65.02 and up.
- No, we got them beat.

39:15.786 --> 39:17.811
<i>And when the guys
from Microsoft showed up...</i>

39:17.988 --> 39:20.957
<i>...how were we to know who they were?
Them standing there...</i>

39:21.125 --> 39:24.561
<i>...looking at an empty Altair booth
on one side and us on the other.</i>

39:24.729 --> 39:27.220
<i>- I mean, who would you choose?
- Hi, how are you?</i>

39:30.735 --> 39:31.963
- Hi.
- Steve.

39:32.136 --> 39:33.660
- How you doing?
- I'm Bill Gates.

39:33.838 --> 39:35.430
- Yeah, hi.
- Chairman of Microsoft.

39:35.606 --> 39:38.336
- Nice to see you. We had a box...
- Microsoft, we design...

39:38.509 --> 39:40.807
Yeah, good to see you.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.576
- Hey, Steve. Over here.
- Hi, John.

39:52.456 --> 39:53.684
Excuse me, excuse me.

39:54.892 --> 39:57.190
No, wait, come here. Come here.

39:57.695 --> 40:00.289
Maybe he just didn't hear you
or something.

40:00.464 --> 40:01.692
Yeah, maybe.

40:01.866 --> 40:06.428
For the first time in my life, people are
coming to me, instead of me going to them.

40:06.604 --> 40:09.266
Man, this is insanely great.

40:27.024 --> 40:29.322
<i>I'm telling you, it was a weird time.</i>

40:29.493 --> 40:32.951
<i>People were going nuts over the Apple II.
I couldn't keep up with anything.</i>

40:33.130 --> 40:37.328
<i>The company was expanding so fast I
didn't know who half the new people were.</i>

40:51.449 --> 40:54.077
<i>And Steve had a lot of people,
you know, older people...</i>

40:54.251 --> 40:57.584
<i>...start pay attention to him,
which was amazing.</i>

40:57.755 --> 41:00.986
<i>And me too, sort of.
People even knew who I was.</i>

41:01.158 --> 41:02.591
<i>- Hi.
- Should have been fun...</i>

41:02.760 --> 41:06.093
<i>...but with all the good stuff,
bad stuff came too.</i>

41:10.835 --> 41:12.063
- Steve.
- What?

41:12.236 --> 41:14.329
Oh, jeez. Not again.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.204
What? What? What?

41:19.376 --> 41:22.311
What are you...? What are you talking about,
it's not your child?

41:22.480 --> 41:24.380
How do I even know if this baby's mine?

41:24.548 --> 41:26.880
- You know. Damn you, you know.
- How do I know that?

41:27.051 --> 41:29.884
Steve, I'm two months pregnant.
Who else have I been with?

41:30.054 --> 41:33.182
Look, go do whatever it is you wanna do.
You wanna play mommy? Fine.

41:33.357 --> 41:36.622
- But the kid's not mine.
- It is. It is.

41:36.794 --> 41:38.659
You bastard!

41:39.129 --> 41:40.824
God.

41:42.867 --> 41:44.630
What did they say?

41:44.802 --> 41:47.498
Hey, Steve. Take a look at this.

41:47.671 --> 41:49.536
Carl's got that parity on that BASIC...

41:49.707 --> 41:53.768
You guys are not being paid
to be a bunch of clowns!

41:53.944 --> 41:57.107
Or maybe you are.
Maybe that's the problem around here.

41:57.281 --> 41:59.909
You guys are supposed
to be writing programs.

42:00.084 --> 42:01.881
Steve, we were just doing...

42:02.052 --> 42:06.989
I need people with talent.
I need artists!

42:07.725 --> 42:13.823
What the hell are you morons but a bunch
of clock-punching losers? Huh, tell me?

42:17.434 --> 42:21.734
And here is another letter
of recommendation.

42:22.373 --> 42:26.309
Well, Mr. Brewster,
we've looked at your application...

42:26.477 --> 42:28.638
...and I see a lot
of mainframe experience here.

42:28.812 --> 42:31.781
Six years. Actually...

42:33.083 --> 42:36.951
Six and a half.

42:38.489 --> 42:42.550
Steve? I don't know
if you've met Steve Jobs.

42:42.726 --> 42:46.321
Yes. No. It's good to meet you.

42:46.497 --> 42:48.522
Right.

42:49.099 --> 42:51.226
You were in marketing, correct?

42:51.402 --> 42:53.870
That was before the programming. Yeah.

42:54.038 --> 42:56.973
I took night-school courses
at San José State.

42:57.141 --> 42:59.132
You look like an IBM type.

42:59.977 --> 43:01.239
Well...

43:01.412 --> 43:06.679
...no. But I did have a chance in college
to be interviewed by them...

43:07.751 --> 43:11.016
...and they liked me. They flew me out
to their headquarters Back East.

43:14.925 --> 43:17.519
Oh, I'm sure they did.

43:17.695 --> 43:19.890
No, I did, see?

43:20.064 --> 43:24.398
I was one of about a dozen people
that they really recruited.

43:24.568 --> 43:26.399
Are you a virgin?

43:28.872 --> 43:30.134
Steve, come on.

43:31.141 --> 43:35.168
- What? Am I what?
- Are you a virgin?

43:35.346 --> 43:37.337
L...

43:37.648 --> 43:38.876
No.

43:42.119 --> 43:43.984
How old were you
when you first got laid?

43:44.154 --> 43:46.088
I don't... I don't...

43:46.724 --> 43:49.989
- Steve, will you leave him alone?
- I asked you a question.

43:53.764 --> 43:59.327
My wife and I have been married
since we were in grad school.

43:59.503 --> 44:02.734
I didn't ask you about your wife.

44:04.108 --> 44:08.442
You're still a virgin.
You just think you're not.

44:14.151 --> 44:16.142
You don't fit in here.

44:21.025 --> 44:23.550
Why are you even wasting our time?

44:39.777 --> 44:41.768
I...

44:46.817 --> 44:49.183
Yeah, I'll run a test on it.

44:54.725 --> 44:55.987
Steve...

44:56.160 --> 45:01.894
...you demolished that guy.
- Woz, what we're doing right now...

45:02.966 --> 45:04.934
...is like...

45:06.303 --> 45:08.362
...opening doors.

45:08.539 --> 45:10.234
Every day.

45:10.808 --> 45:15.541
If you open the wrong one,
all sorts of bad things will come at you.

45:16.580 --> 45:19.344
You gotta be careful
which door you open.

45:25.689 --> 45:29.625
- You want me to go apologize to that guy?
- Well, he probably left.

45:30.661 --> 45:33.994
You know, Steve, there's things
you probably have to get past with me.

45:34.665 --> 45:37.862
But I'm telling you, there's things
that I have to get past with you.

45:38.035 --> 45:40.162
I mean, people say stuff
about you sometimes...

45:40.337 --> 45:42.931
...and I don't listen to them,
because I know you.

45:43.107 --> 45:46.941
I mean, I excuse stuff
because we're friends.

45:50.380 --> 45:52.371
It's worth it. It is.

45:53.083 --> 45:55.244
It's worth it. It's worth it. It's worth it.

45:58.388 --> 46:00.788
<i>It was about five years
after I got out of Harvard...</i>

46:02.459 --> 46:06.520
<i>...I get this call from Bill, who says,
"You wanna join me and Paul?"</i>

46:06.697 --> 46:09.530
<i>It was a two-bit little company
they called Microsoft.</i>

46:09.700 --> 46:13.830
<i>And at first I think,
"Yeah. Like I'd like to lose more hair. "</i>

46:14.004 --> 46:16.302
<i>But, you know, then I started thinking.</i>

46:16.473 --> 46:18.168
You know how you survive?

46:18.675 --> 46:20.836
You make people need you.

46:21.145 --> 46:25.411
You survive because
you make them need what you have.

46:26.150 --> 46:28.914
And then they have nowhere else to go.

46:32.523 --> 46:34.491
Right now we're dead.

46:35.425 --> 46:40.226
- Nobody needs us.
- So we make them need us?

46:41.231 --> 46:43.699
We're too small even to matter.

46:43.867 --> 46:48.201
We could be snuffed out tomorrow,
and no one would notice.

46:48.372 --> 46:50.237
You know what they say in the Mafia?

46:51.675 --> 46:56.442
You keep your friends close
but your enemies closer.

46:56.613 --> 46:59.309
Which enemies are you talking about?

47:05.289 --> 47:08.019
I got some full barf bags here.
Full barf bags. Heads up.

47:08.192 --> 47:09.853
- He's sick.
- Bald guy with barf bags.

47:10.027 --> 47:13.224
Coming through. Full ones too.
How you doing?

47:19.136 --> 47:20.763
Come on.

47:34.051 --> 47:38.579
- My tie. I forgot my tie.
- Great, Bill. We're already late.

47:44.494 --> 47:48.225
Hey, how you doing?
Ten bucks for your tie. Okay, 20.

47:48.866 --> 47:52.768
Thirty. Come on, come on.
Thirty. Thirty bucks for that tie.

47:52.936 --> 47:56.929
Where did you get that, Sears? Come on.
Help us out here. Would you? Please?

48:00.377 --> 48:02.868
<i>You see, by that time,
Bill had already figured out...</i>

48:03.046 --> 48:07.608
<i>...that we gotta go right into the belly of the
beast. The scariest beast of them all, IBM.</i>

48:07.784 --> 48:13.120
<i>IBM. And back then, man, they were like
Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan...</i>

48:13.290 --> 48:16.919
<i>...and Vlad the Impaler all rolled into one.</i>

48:17.094 --> 48:21.258
<i>But what we were gonna do was,
we were gonna make them love us.</i>

48:21.431 --> 48:23.763
Gentlemen, how are you? Nice tie.

48:23.934 --> 48:25.925
- Thanks.
- We're over here.

48:26.803 --> 48:29.533
Our shirts are as white as theirs.

48:31.775 --> 48:34.209
We think we have what you need.

48:34.778 --> 48:36.211
That's a start.

48:36.380 --> 48:41.477
Now, we know that IBM has set up
this place to compete head-on with Apple...

48:42.619 --> 48:46.885
...and you're gearing up to come out with a
personal computer that will wipe them out.

48:47.057 --> 48:49.116
So we can get you an operating system.

48:49.860 --> 48:52.420
What kind of operating system?

48:52.596 --> 48:54.359
It's called...

48:54.531 --> 48:56.328
...DOS.

48:57.200 --> 49:01.899
This is amazing.
Not just amazing, it's historic.

49:02.072 --> 49:04.404
It should be taught
in all the history books.

49:04.574 --> 49:07.839
I mean, hung and framed
in the National Gallery or something.

49:08.011 --> 49:10.673
Because this is the instant of creation...

49:10.847 --> 49:14.112
...of one of the greatest fortunes
in the history of the world.

49:14.284 --> 49:19.916
I mean, Bill Gates is the richest guy in the
world because of what started in this room.

49:20.090 --> 49:21.523
You wanna know what else?

49:21.692 --> 49:25.685
It wasn't exactly smoke and mirrors,
but we didn't have anything.

49:25.862 --> 49:29.593
I mean, not a damn thing.

49:30.100 --> 49:32.261
Here we were, this two-bit little outfit...

49:32.436 --> 49:36.395
...telling IBM we had the answer
to their problems.

49:36.573 --> 49:39.337
DOS? The Disk Operating System?

49:39.509 --> 49:43.240
To make all those zillion
IBM computers compute?

49:43.413 --> 49:47.509
We didn't even remotely own
anything like what Bill was selling them.

49:47.684 --> 49:50.016
<i>Nada, zip.</i>

49:55.058 --> 49:57.925
Of course, we don't just
wanna sell it to you outright.

49:58.095 --> 50:00.086
We wanna be able to license it to you.

50:00.263 --> 50:03.596
- You want to retain ownership?
- Right.

50:04.835 --> 50:10.432
Well, the profits are in the computers
themselves, not this software stuff.

50:13.877 --> 50:15.469
No big deal.

50:16.146 --> 50:17.374
Oh, and one other thing.

50:17.547 --> 50:19.708
We have to be able...

50:19.883 --> 50:22.374
...to sell it to other outfits.

50:24.621 --> 50:25.952
But...

50:26.123 --> 50:30.958
...there was just one little problem.

50:32.262 --> 50:35.754
Bill, why did you tell them
we have an operating system?

50:35.932 --> 50:38.560
We don't have a thing to sell them now.
We're dead.

50:38.735 --> 50:42.831
- We're not. You'll give us the miracle, right?
- Oh, yeah, right.

50:43.006 --> 50:46.635
Well, come on. You said you knew a guy
we could buy an operating system from.

50:46.810 --> 50:48.801
I said I sort of know him.

50:48.979 --> 50:52.142
Sort of? You heard me.
Don't tell me "sort of. " I just told IBM.

50:53.683 --> 50:55.583
Sort of.

51:01.491 --> 51:04.153
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

51:19.609 --> 51:23.101
So basically, you're saying
you wanna buy my operating system.

51:23.280 --> 51:24.508
Yeah.

51:29.486 --> 51:30.714
Why?

51:34.858 --> 51:40.797
You know, I don't know. We just think we
might be able to mess with it and resell it.

51:40.964 --> 51:42.192
Who to?

51:42.365 --> 51:45.129
We have a few customers, you know,
we're sort of talking to.

51:45.302 --> 51:47.827
Some of them don't want it known
what we're doing.

51:48.004 --> 51:51.405
So they made us sign
a secrecy agreement.

51:54.611 --> 51:57.409
- And you're offering us?
- Fifty thousand.

51:57.581 --> 52:00.345
- Dollars?
- Dollars.

52:07.591 --> 52:08.819
You worried?

52:08.992 --> 52:12.052
Oh, no. Only my whole life hangs
in the balance. Me, worried? No.

52:13.463 --> 52:15.328
We got IBM.

52:15.499 --> 52:17.990
IBM. I mean, come to think of it...

52:18.168 --> 52:21.660
...why would IBM wanna make a deal
with a bunch of bozos like us?

52:21.838 --> 52:23.829
Because they're successful, Ballmer.

52:24.007 --> 52:27.602
Success is a menace. It fools smart people
into thinking they can't lose.

52:39.389 --> 52:40.788
So?

52:44.094 --> 52:46.221
So, you mute moron?

52:58.408 --> 53:01.275
<i>Can you hear it? The sound of money?</i>

53:02.846 --> 53:06.304
<i>The roar of money. It was like everywhere
you turned, money poured down.</i>

53:06.483 --> 53:08.417
<i>Millions and more millions.</i>

53:08.585 --> 53:13.045
<i>All because we bought that guy's
operating system for a measly 50,000 bucks.</i>

53:13.223 --> 53:18.718
<i>That fueled a worldwide explosion of wealth
unlike anything in the history of man.</i>

53:18.895 --> 53:21.159
<i>But you know something?</i>

53:21.331 --> 53:26.428
<i>Having money and being cool
are not necessarily the same thing.</i>

53:26.603 --> 53:28.901
- Hi, I'm Bill Gates...
- Hey.

53:29.839 --> 53:31.739
What in the...?

53:33.343 --> 53:34.640
Hi.

53:35.212 --> 53:37.646
You know, you should really watch
where you're going.

53:38.215 --> 53:40.183
You must have really great bandwidth.

53:40.350 --> 53:43.285
- Excuse me?
- What are you doing later?

53:49.092 --> 53:51.083
Who is that jerk?

53:54.531 --> 53:56.260
Way to go, hotshot.

53:59.703 --> 54:02.866
When Paul and I were at Lakeside,
we were in 10th grade together...

54:03.039 --> 54:06.372
...we rigged a computer so we could
get classes with all the best girls.

54:06.543 --> 54:08.477
Obviously, it's been downhill since then.

54:08.645 --> 54:12.274
You should walk around with your bankbook
hanging from a chain on your belt.

54:12.449 --> 54:15.976
Or maybe you ought to stop yelling
in front of your employees.

54:16.152 --> 54:19.178
Girls don't like yelling. They like cool.

54:19.356 --> 54:21.984
Oh, really, Ballmer?
How do you get to be cool?

54:22.692 --> 54:25.661
<i>I don't know. You saw
Saturday Night Fever. Travolta's cool.</i>

54:54.357 --> 55:00.023
I'd like to welcome all of you to the new
headquarters and home of Apple Computers.

55:00.196 --> 55:02.391
<i>All of a sudden, Steve was a huge star.</i>

55:02.565 --> 55:05.329
<i>The kind where people practically
hang on your every word...</i>

55:05.502 --> 55:07.902
<i>...like they're excited
just to be around you.</i>

55:08.071 --> 55:12.007
Thank you very much
for joining us today on this lovely day...

55:12.175 --> 55:14.803
...and helping us stop the gossip rumors
in their tracks.

55:14.978 --> 55:16.843
Without further ado,
the rumors are true.

55:17.013 --> 55:19.504
Ladies and gentlemen,
our new president, John Sculley.

55:25.555 --> 55:29.457
To tell you the truth, I was perfectly happy
to be president of Pepsi-Cola...

55:29.626 --> 55:33.118
...until Steve Jobs came to recruit me
and said:

55:33.296 --> 55:36.094
"Do you wanna sell sugared water
for the rest of your life...

55:36.266 --> 55:37.858
...or do you wanna make history?"

55:39.369 --> 55:41.030
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

55:41.204 --> 55:43.229
- I know.
- Yeah, operator.

55:43.406 --> 55:46.432
- I need information for Oregon.
- Okay, give me a minute.

55:51.114 --> 55:54.311
Steve, I gotta talk. I don't know how
to act in situations like this.

55:54.484 --> 55:57.180
- In a minute.
- I mean, Steve, that stock-offering thing?

55:57.354 --> 55:58.582
A hundred million dollars?

55:58.755 --> 56:00.916
- What do you do with $ 116 million?
- In a minute.

56:01.091 --> 56:05.050
I don't think rich, okay? I know a lot of
people think rich, but I don't think rich.

56:05.228 --> 56:09.255
I mean, maybe you learn it, but, jeez,
$ 100 million. That's a lot of learning to do.

56:09.432 --> 56:12.424
I hardly ever had enough for lunch
before all this.

56:13.203 --> 56:15.603
We should have given stock
to the other guys, Steve.

56:15.772 --> 56:18.434
Like Dan?
Dan's been with us since we started...

56:18.608 --> 56:21.304
...and you didn't set aside
any stock for him.

56:23.446 --> 56:25.107
Steve.

56:25.915 --> 56:28.713
- I'm gonna give Dan some of my stock.
- Yeah, is Arlene there?

56:28.885 --> 56:30.580
We gotta do the right thing.

56:31.154 --> 56:33.418
<i>Arlene? Okay, fine.
Let's talk about this baby.</i>

56:33.590 --> 56:36.821
Steve, why do you care
what I call the baby?

56:36.993 --> 56:40.053
Because I don't want
the baby named Rainbow.

56:40.230 --> 56:44.257
Or Orisha or Ravi Shankar
or any other name like that.

56:44.934 --> 56:47.368
Steve, not right now, okay?

56:47.537 --> 56:51.200
<i>Well, when the hell is a good time to call?
Because every time I try...</i>

56:54.043 --> 56:55.840
Steve.

57:44.327 --> 57:46.261
- Do you want me to take that?
- Thank you.

57:46.429 --> 57:48.124
You're welcome.

58:12.388 --> 58:13.855
Hi.

58:14.457 --> 58:15.947
Hi.

58:18.795 --> 58:21.764
So I just came by to make sure
everything's okay.

58:23.132 --> 58:25.794
- Everything okay?
- Thank you.

58:37.714 --> 58:39.807
And to...

58:39.983 --> 58:43.248
...make sure that you're not
gonna name it some weird name.

58:46.890 --> 58:49.950
What's wrong with naming her Orisha?

58:50.894 --> 58:52.953
Or Sunshine or Purity?

58:54.597 --> 58:57.088
A kid's got enough problems
in this world...

58:57.267 --> 58:59.292
...not knowing where it belongs.

58:59.469 --> 59:00.993
A name can label a kid.

59:02.071 --> 59:03.629
Make it...

59:03.806 --> 59:06.172
It can make it an outsider.

59:06.910 --> 59:08.434
Not "it. "

59:08.611 --> 59:09.839
Her.

59:11.080 --> 59:12.638
Her.

59:24.127 --> 59:25.685
Lisa.

59:29.599 --> 59:31.260
Okay.

59:31.734 --> 59:33.224
Okay.

59:36.172 --> 59:38.106
She's your daughter too.

59:40.143 --> 59:43.374
Arlene, let's not go through that again.

59:56.559 --> 59:59.551
You don't just live in life.

59:59.729 --> 01:00:04.393
You change it, you shape it,
you make your mark upon it.

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:07.662
And that's what, get used to the name...

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:11.238
...Lisa is gonna do.

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:12.635
Yeah!

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:16.210
<i>You know, that computer was
the first big new project we had at Apple.</i>

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:20.577
<i>And some people are still wondering
why Steve insisted on that name.</i>

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.586
You wanna call a computer Lisa?

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:26.778
Isn't that your baby's...?

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:28.685
I mean...

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:33.591
What's her name? Arlene.
Isn't that Arlene's baby's name?

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:36.493
Other guys here
have daughters named Lisa.

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:41.035
Steve, you got a baby up there
you don't even wanna talk about.

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:46.034
- I mean, it looks sort of...
- Sort of what?

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:59.186
We have to think of ourselves as artists.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.754
It's like Picasso said:

01:01:02.925 --> 01:01:06.622
Good artists copy. Great artists steal.

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:11.598
<i>This is who we wanted
to steal from. Xerox.</i>

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:14.293
<i>They were secretly developing
all this amazing stuff...</i>

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:18.338
<i>...like the mouse and the graphics on the
screen instead of just a bunch of numbers.</i>

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:21.341
<i>But when those California engineers
had to go to New York...</i>

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:24.105
<i>...and present all this neat stuff
to the Xerox brass...</i>

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.772
<i>...those executives didn't begin
to understand what they were looking at.</i>

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:33.547
<i>Never mind a mouse. It was like someone
dumped a dead rat on the boardroom table.</i>

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:42.994
A mouse.

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:51.331
You want Xerox to consider
something called a mouse?

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.812
<i>See, this is where Steve was a genius...</i>

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:03.577
<i>...because he persuaded Xerox
into showing us all this incredible stuff...</i>

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:05.550
<i>...their California guys had developed.</i>

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.350
<i>I tell you, it was making their people
absolutely nuts.</i>

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:11.488
Oh, God.

01:02:15.098 --> 01:02:17.032
Let's go.

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:20.761
<i>You know, I felt like
one of the Mongol hordes...</i>

01:02:20.937 --> 01:02:24.668
<i>...coming to loot and plunder
a bunch of defenseless villagers.</i>

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:29.440
No, no. This is insane.

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:31.739
We'd just be handing him everything.

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:37.079
We created the mouse and all the rest of it,
and now these idiots in New York...

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:39.278
...want to show it all to Steve Jobs.

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:40.820
I won't do it.

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:43.982
Hi. I'm Steve Jobs.

01:02:46.729 --> 01:02:50.130
I need you to answer some other questions
about the stuff you've invented.

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:52.290
The graphic interface?

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.568
It's not going to hurt.

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:58.506
That's what you think.

01:03:00.576 --> 01:03:03.067
- What do you want to know?
- How does it...?

01:03:03.246 --> 01:03:05.942
What is your base length?
Is it integer, or is it compound?

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:08.640
Does your operating system
convert to executable codes?

01:03:08.818 --> 01:03:12.254
- I got it. I got it, Steve-O. I got it, Steve-O.
- What is the middle...?

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:20.020
It's pretty neat, right?

01:03:20.196 --> 01:03:22.790
Click, you're there.

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:25.191
Click, you're somewhere else.

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:29.429
This graphic interface stuff was like
a miracle back then, and we got it.

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:33.769
Steve got it, from Xerox, who just
turned it all over for us to fool with.

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:37.401
Like rich people giving junky old stuff
to the Salvation Army...

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:40.879
...only the junk turns out
to be a Rembrandt.

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:44.611
About $ 100 billion head start
on everyone else.

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:48.416
Apple was making tons of money.
It was great.

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:53.290
And of course, I sort of lost my mind.
I mean, it was all fun and games.

01:03:53.462 --> 01:03:56.056
I started buying really expensive toys.

01:03:57.934 --> 01:04:00.300
<i>It was me with my own plane.</i>

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:03.996
<i>Only problem was, maybe I wasn't
as good a pilot as I thought I was.</i>

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:07.404
<i>I mean, it's one thing
when computers crash, but planes?</i>

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:08.805
<i>You don't want to know.</i>

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:18.586
Hey, Steve. Are you just getting here?

01:04:18.754 --> 01:04:20.984
No, I was just outside
talking to the doctor.

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:23.557
You don't remember us
talking 10 minutes ago?

01:04:23.726 --> 01:04:25.557
- We talked?
- Yeah.

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:27.889
Hey, my hard disk crashed.

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:33.428
A computer guy with memory problems.

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:37.271
Oh, man.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.637
It's the weirdest thing.
You know there's a part of your life there...

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:42.778
...only you don't know about it.

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:45.311
It makes you crazy.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:01.492
Hey.

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:04.929
Hey!

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:08.663
Paul.

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:11.329
Simonyi, get Matthews.

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:13.441
Ballmer, get in here.

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:19.438
- What is it?
- This is seriously crummy.

01:05:19.615 --> 01:05:22.175
Apple's new computer, Lisa? We're dead.

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:23.909
Oh, yeah, I've already seen one.

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:26.350
The graphics and the operating system
they have...

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:29.355
...they make what we're selling IBM
look a decade out-of-date.

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:31.652
- I want it.
- What do you mean, you want it?

01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:37.163
- It's Apple's. We can't just go and steal it.
- You're not listening to me. I want it.

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:43.829
<i>Final call for TWA flight 2684
to San Jose. Final call.</i>

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:48.533
- Fifty bucks he misses the flight.
- You're on.

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:50.679
It wouldn't hurt to buy a car radio, Bill.

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:53.076
- I can't pick up the radio...
- One traffic report.

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:55.740
- Hold on.
- Sir, we're on this plane.

01:05:55.918 --> 01:05:58.751
I'm sorry. Your plane is on the runway.

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:00.980
Ma'am, what kind of service
is this today?

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:05.093
I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing that can bring
that plane back to the gate.

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:08.924
Yes, there is. Willpower. I'm going to will
that that plane be turned around.

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:11.191
- Oh, really?
- Really, sir.

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:15.167
Are you aware that today in my briefcase
are computer language codes?

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:17.932
- Do you know what they do, sir?
- I'm afraid I don't.

01:06:18.107 --> 01:06:21.167
They protect against viruses.
You're aware of viruses, I presume?

01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:25.713
- Sir, I do go to doctors.
- No, sir, computer viruses.

01:06:25.881 --> 01:06:28.281
Oh, yeah, I just read an article
about those things.

01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:31.477
- They can wipe out a whole computer.
- A whole system of computers.

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:34.851
Like the one behind your terminal there,
like the one in the plane...

01:06:35.024 --> 01:06:39.222
...like the one on all planes in the airlines,
like the one in the control tower, sir.

01:06:39.395 --> 01:06:42.694
I ask you, are you prepared
to take responsibility for your actions...

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:45.891
...if I don't get this information
on that plane?

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:51.939
Jeez, his reputation for inconveniencing
the rest of the world is intact.

01:06:52.108 --> 01:06:53.803
He actually missed a flight.

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:57.742
<i>This is your captain speaking. We have
to return to the gate for a few minutes.</i>

01:06:57.913 --> 01:07:00.211
<i>Nothing critical.</i>

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:10.523
<i>- Attention, please, flight...
- Your tickets, please.</i>

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:14.959
- You have the tickets, right?
- No, I gave them to you.

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:18.464
Bill, in the car.

01:07:35.117 --> 01:07:38.280
Wow. These guys must be
50 times bigger than we are.

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:41.446
Good artists copy. Great artists steal.

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:45.116
- Oh, yeah? Who said that?
- Some artist. I think it was Van Gogh.

01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:49.296
Hey, check it out.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.794
Aye, matey. It wouldn't be time
to rape and pillage, would it?

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:06.814
You sure it's okay
to let these Microsoft guys in here?

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:10.051
We have culture. They don't.

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:13.480
No taste. No original thinking.

01:08:14.123 --> 01:08:16.421
But they can be useful to us.

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:19.823
Time for the dog and pony show.

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:31.237
Welcome to Apple.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.179
Bill.

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.319
Nice to see you. Thanks for coming.
Steve.

01:08:46.488 --> 01:08:49.390
- How you doing, Steve?
- Glad you're here. Paul. Hi, Steve Jobs.

01:08:49.558 --> 01:08:52.118
- Hi. Charles Simonyi.
- Come on in. Let me introduce you.

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:54.888
This is Gilmore.
He's one of our top programmers.

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:58.024
And he's a loyal man.
Well, to do this, you need loyalty.

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:02.098
- Total loyalty. Isn't that right?
- That's the plan, Steve.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:07.309
This way. The Macintosh team.
It's more like a family.

01:09:07.475 --> 01:09:10.309
Everybody else is an outsider.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:13.676
- What's with the pirate stuff?
- What do I always tell you?

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:16.209
Better to be a pirate than join the Navy.

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:19.548
- You a pirate?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely, Steve.

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:21.885
I've been up for 52 hours straight.

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:24.754
Loyalty.

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:35.493
I'm gonna show you the future.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:39.300
It's top-secret. It's still about...

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:42.273
...a year away from introduction.

01:09:42.778 --> 01:09:45.645
The ultimate, insanely great...

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.411
...fusion of art and science.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:55.150
- It's called the Macintosh.
- This is definitely not the Lisa.

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.554
That's a graphic user interface.

01:09:57.726 --> 01:10:01.457
I don't understand. How does a computer
handle the mouse-cursor display?

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:03.621
Hardware's got nothing to do
with the mouse.

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:06.097
- It's all in the software.
- Enough.

01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:08.463
Sorry, Steve.

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:12.329
There's no point in torturing our guests...

01:10:12.841 --> 01:10:15.309
...with what they can't have.

01:10:23.485 --> 01:10:26.283
You're vulnerable in spreadsheets,
you know, Steve.

01:10:26.455 --> 01:10:28.719
We can help you.

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:33.790
Ninety hours a week. Like the T-shirt?
I'm gonna give it to my people.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.894
Some of them work even more
than 90 hours a week.

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:41.969
We have Multiplan running on
dozens of different platforms.

01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:44.298
No one can match us.

01:10:45.107 --> 01:10:47.473
You can't just have employees anymore.

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:49.270
It's great.

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:52.305
No, they gotta be into a crusade.

01:10:52.481 --> 01:10:58.181
It's like art, science, religion,
all rolled into one.

01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:02.415
We have multi-tool interface.
It can be redesigned for the Mac.

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:06.254
Redesigned. Redesigned.

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:09.090
We're artists here.

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:11.893
A place where raw sand
comes in one end...

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:16.197
...and goes out the other. Silicon art.

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:23.039
You know, IBM, they're gonna want
all our stuff.

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:25.178
IBM?

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:30.144
IBM, they're history.

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:35.757
I mean, they're 1950s, they're ice America,
a bloated enemy in a crumbling castle.

01:11:35.924 --> 01:11:38.722
- And we're storming it.
- I know IBM is the enemy, Steve.

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:41.089
But we can help you.

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:43.564
You don't have to worry about IBM.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.234
Yeah?

01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:48.427
So why you even working with them?

01:11:49.104 --> 01:11:51.766
I'd much rather work with you.

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:03.549
We're in.

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:06.280
- We're doing work for Apple.
- You're kidding me.

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:09.390
They're sending us three prototypes
of the computer we just saw.

01:12:09.558 --> 01:12:11.048
- The Macintosh.
- For God sakes.

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:14.992
There's a pirate flag flying above our heads,
and he's giving us the crown jewel?

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:16.791
Who the hell's the pirate here?

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:19.297
He sees what he believes,
not the other way around.

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:21.265
We're not his worst problem.

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:24.201
If he's not careful,
he's gonna wreck the place.

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:27.437
- Macintosh! Macintosh!
- Macintosh rules!

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:30.544
- Apple II's the best!
- Mac's the best!

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:33.978
<i>Even when I got my memory back,
it was never the same for me.</i>

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:36.117
<i>I couldn't believe
how it had all changed.</i>

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:38.412
<i>Apple was tearing itself to pieces.</i>

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:41.581
<i>Steve had turned it into two camps:</i>

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:46.285
<i>His new Macintosh group
against everyone else in the company.</i>

01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:53.128
Steve, what the hell is this?

01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:57.469
It's like a family. Things get messy.

01:12:57.873 --> 01:12:59.238
I don't understand this.

01:12:59.408 --> 01:13:02.571
You got the Mac people
against the Apple II people?

01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:04.838
- They're beating each other up.
- Amazing, huh?

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:08.449
People wanna be shaped, molded.

01:13:08.617 --> 01:13:11.347
But if you asked any of them,
any of them, they'd deny it.

01:13:11.954 --> 01:13:16.288
I don't wanna shape anybody, Steve.
This isn't fun anymore.

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:20.019
Maybe fun is just fragments of existence
with better packaging.

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:23.397
I don't make jokes anymore.

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:27.399
I told you a long time ago, I like jokes.

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:32.836
Steve! Goodbye. I'm quitting Apple.

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:38.978
- Well, that's a joke, right?
- No. I'm going back to college.

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:44.950
Woz. Hey, what are you doing?
I don't think it's such a good idea.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:49.022
All I'm doing now is being a brake pedal
for you as you're heading for the wall.

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:53.857
Woz!

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:26.260
- I ask you for brilliance?
- Steve.

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:31.388
I've asked you for genius,
and you're giving me this?

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:34.602
Steve, please.

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:47.577
Oh, no, Steve, not again.

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:51.708
It's 3 a. m., okay? I don't have the energy
to defend an unfinished design.

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:55.414
That's because there's nothing to defend.

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:59.925
I want beauty, not incompetence.

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:02.721
Are you listening to me?

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:05.365
- Are you listening...?
- Yes, I'm listening!

01:15:05.534 --> 01:15:07.627
I am so sick of your abusiveness.

01:15:08.904 --> 01:15:11.998
That's all you know.
Tearing people down, throwing tantrums.

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:17.578
- You miserable son of a bitch.
- What are you doing? Come on, back off.

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:34.953
<i>I know we've been in a battle...</i>

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:38.657
...and like all battles,
we've had our casualties along the way.

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:41.163
But today's about celebrating.

01:15:43.138 --> 01:15:44.662
The Macintosh.

01:15:51.246 --> 01:15:53.214
It's time for a christening...

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:57.814
...of our little Macintosh.

01:15:57.986 --> 01:15:59.886
Our baby.

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:12.394
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

01:16:14.136 --> 01:16:16.969
Real artists ship.

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:20.898
In this company, in Apple,
in the entire business...

01:16:21.076 --> 01:16:25.809
...we, you, the Macintosh team,
are the only true artists.

01:16:25.981 --> 01:16:28.677
You can forget Apple, forget Lisa.

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:32.377
It's only us. The Macintosh team.

01:16:32.554 --> 01:16:35.387
We have been chosen to seize history.

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:42.458
But first, carpe diem, seize the day.
It's your time to party, people.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.791
Hey, John.

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:49.027
You hear what I heard in there?

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:21.034
- Hey, man, what'd you say about Steve?
- I'm sick of his crap.

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:23.068
- What'd you say, man?
- You heard me.

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:25.433
You wanna talk like that about Steve?

01:17:25.607 --> 01:17:28.269
You wanna talk like that about the guy
who feeds you, man?

01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:32.345
- The guy who feeds you?
- Come on. Break it up.

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:34.311
Come on.

01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:38.218
- Hey, hey, guys.
- Somebody pull him off.

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:41.487
- Never like this at Pepsi-Cola.
- Knock it off.

01:17:41.957 --> 01:17:44.755
You wanna sell sugar water
the rest of your life?

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:00.370
Steve, I'm worried.

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:04.277
Yeah?

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:07.142
Yeah, about what's happening.

01:18:07.582 --> 01:18:12.212
All the, you know, "them versus us" stuff.
Macintosh versus Apple II.

01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:15.845
You don't understand, John.
People need a cause.

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:19.391
We missed Vietnam. This is our Vietnam.

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:24.292
- It's tearing the company apart.
- Creation is messy.

01:18:24.466 --> 01:18:27.264
You want genius, you get madness.
Two sides of the same coin.

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:29.529
You knew that when I brought you in.

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:32.265
Steve, if you can't trust me,
then God help you.

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:35.433
I didn't mention anything
about trust, John.

01:18:39.081 --> 01:18:40.378
There's another problem.

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:45.544
- It's Arlene and the baby.
- That's my business.

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:49.782
<i>No, not anymore.
TIME magazine is doing another story.</i>

01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:52.222
You don't need the bad press.
Neither do we.

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:55.329
- Child's not mine.
- Steve, come on. You took a paternity test.

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:58.598
She is yours.
It's right there in the results.

01:18:58.767 --> 01:19:03.261
- Paternity tests are a joke.
- She's asking for $20,000.

01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:05.838
- Total, nothing more.
- Blackmail.

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:08.976
Steve, you can afford the money.
Give her what she's asking for.

01:19:09.144 --> 01:19:11.874
- You should give her more.
- It's not about the damn money.

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:14.409
Well, what is it, then?

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.676
I don't know.

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:11.400
Mommy, there's a man here.

01:20:28.423 --> 01:20:31.620
It's been what, a year?

01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:38.588
- Yeah, I've been busy.
- I'm sure.

01:20:40.802 --> 01:20:44.704
- Why'd you come?
- I don't know.

01:20:46.741 --> 01:20:48.641
She's looking really good.

01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:57.383
You should have come to see her.

01:20:57.552 --> 01:21:01.613
- You could have brought her by.
- Oh, Steve.

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:06.260
Here.

01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:18.405
Thank you.

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:20.998
Thank you, Lisa.

01:21:57.279 --> 01:22:00.680
- Steve Jobs is killing us. Ballmer!
- Yeah?

01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:02.817
This stuff is crummy. It's totally crummy.

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:05.817
- Windows was supposed to ship last year.
- We're ready for you.

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:08.455
Why do I have to do this?
I have work. This is stupid.

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:10.750
<i>It's good PR.
It's for The Wall Street Journal.</i>

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:13.656
- I don't need PR.
- Can you stand a little to the left?

01:22:13.828 --> 01:22:17.264
The hole in that sweater of your shirt.
Turn all the way to the right.

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:19.024
What am I, a trained seal?

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:22.363
- Lf Apple can do this, why can't we?
- What do you want us to do?

01:22:22.537 --> 01:22:24.664
- Whatever you have to.
- Meaning what, Bill?

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:26.966
Meaning ship Windows
before the snow falls.

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:29.736
- This is Seattle. It doesn't snow here.
- Whatever, Steve.

01:22:29.911 --> 01:22:32.379
Mr. Gates, I think you should
take off your sweater...

01:22:32.547 --> 01:22:34.674
...because it clashes
with the background.

01:22:34.849 --> 01:22:37.010
The green and blue,
it's just not in these days.

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:39.176
It's not in at all.

01:22:39.354 --> 01:22:42.790
Sweat stains. This is awful.

01:22:49.064 --> 01:22:52.397
- I'd like to get back to work...
- I know, we're almost ready.

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:58.870
Okay, and three, two, one.
Smile, please.

01:22:59.741 --> 01:23:01.868
Urgent, Mr. Gates.

01:23:02.043 --> 01:23:04.807
Thank you. What's next?

01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:08.078
Steve Jobs.

01:23:08.416 --> 01:23:11.180
"Mr. Jobs demands you be
in his office tonight. "

01:23:12.854 --> 01:23:14.845
He's getting paranoid
over what we're doing.

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:16.621
Maybe he should be.

01:23:17.892 --> 01:23:19.917
Not at the pace you're going.

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:22.086
I think I had a date tonight with Ann.

01:23:22.263 --> 01:23:24.288
- I thought she was away on business.
- She is.

01:23:24.466 --> 01:23:26.024
Then how can you have a date?

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:30.001
Well, I go to a movie here, and then
she goes to the same movie in Denver...

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:32.799
...and then we talk on the phone
about it afterwards.

01:23:32.974 --> 01:23:37.138
Jeez, Bill, I hate to see what happens
when you two have sex.

01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:23.480
You're stealing from us!

01:24:26.127 --> 01:24:29.460
Steve, we're not stealing from you.
So don't tell me that.

01:24:30.799 --> 01:24:32.460
What the hell are you doing, then?

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:37.094
What is this that I keep hearing
about you developing this...?

01:24:37.272 --> 01:24:39.866
What do you call it? Windows?

01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:42.373
To compete with us?

01:24:44.946 --> 01:24:49.315
- I'm not doing anything against you, Steve.
- Don't give me that crap!

01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:52.783
You're pirating the software
off our Mac prototypes!

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:54.615
I trusted you.

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:59.627
If you wanna know everything
we're working on, I'll show you.

01:25:07.202 --> 01:25:08.567
<i>The weird thing was...</i>

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:12.433
<i>...Steve Jobs was the one guy
Bill would never yell at. It was the opposite.</i>

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:15.838
<i>Steve would order Bill to fly down there
and then blow up at him...</i>

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:19.707
<i>...but Bill, he would just wait it out,
convince Steve that we were no threat...</i>

01:25:19.881 --> 01:25:23.476
<i>...that this Windows stuff was just
that much more smoke and mirrors...</i>

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:25.915
<i>...and a few hours later,
everything was fine.</i>

01:25:26.087 --> 01:25:28.146
<i>I'm telling you, Bill's a genius at it.</i>

01:25:29.424 --> 01:25:31.688
And that's all you're working on?

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:33.388
Of course.

01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:36.593
- Yeah?
- You know what else?

01:25:36.898 --> 01:25:40.493
Did you read what I said in that
newspaper story on us two days ago?

01:25:40.935 --> 01:25:43.961
- No. What'd you say?
- I said when your Macintosh comes out...

01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:47.006
...that'd be the only computer
I'd want to buy my mom.

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:49.605
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:52.671
Your mom, huh?

01:25:52.847 --> 01:25:57.284
- It's like we're one big family, you know?
- Family?

01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:01.349
You know that.

01:26:05.727 --> 01:26:07.786
Family.

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:11.355
<i>Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve!</i>

01:26:25.046 --> 01:26:26.570
Tell me something.

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:29.911
When did this stop being a business
and start being a religion?

01:26:30.084 --> 01:26:31.483
Thank you for your work.

01:26:31.653 --> 01:26:36.522
And remember, what we will do
in the next year...

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:39.717
...will change the way people think...

01:26:39.894 --> 01:26:42.192
...and communicate.

01:26:44.766 --> 01:26:46.597
Hey.

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:48.429
- Hey.
- So enjoy the revolution...

01:26:48.603 --> 01:26:52.061
...which we have all created and watch...

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.105
You know, Steve thinks IBM's the enemy.

01:26:54.275 --> 01:26:55.606
- Unfolds in front of us.

01:26:55.777 --> 01:26:58.041
He doesn't get it.

01:26:58.213 --> 01:26:59.908
You guys are.

01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:05.043
What are you talking about?

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.950
Copies of your Windows
just started surfacing here.

01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:09.612
You took our stuff, Bill.

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:13.192
You took our stuff, you fooled with it,
and you called it your own.

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:18.627
You always insult your guests like this?

01:27:19.367 --> 01:27:21.528
Make no mistake.

01:27:21.703 --> 01:27:25.503
We are all one big family.

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:29.602
And part of it
are our friends at Microsoft.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:36.342
Bill?

01:27:41.489 --> 01:27:43.957
Ladies and gentlemen, Bill Gates.

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:51.459
Finally, I wanna show you a preview...

01:27:51.633 --> 01:27:55.296
...of the most amazing 60 seconds of film
you'll ever see.

01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:57.700
And we're showing it only once...

01:27:57.872 --> 01:27:59.362
...during the Super Bowl.

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:02.737
So watch and see how we handle IBM.

01:28:03.244 --> 01:28:05.838
I mean Big Brother.

01:28:08.316 --> 01:28:11.877
<i>See, that commercial was interesting
in a lot of ways...</i>

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:15.022
<i>...because when we're at
this big hoopla at Apple...</i>

01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:18.920
<i>...and their engineers are unpacking
all these Japanese computers...</i>

01:28:19.093 --> 01:28:21.618
<i>...with the first copies
of our stuff, Windows...</i>

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:25.061
<i>...that looks a lot like their stuff...</i>

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:27.224
<i>I mean, if I had to pick a moment...</i>

01:28:37.278 --> 01:28:39.007
Hey...

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.842
...I'm getting
some pretty weird vibes here.

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:43.881
Sure we should stay around?

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:49.112
Sometimes you deal them.
Sometimes you fold them.

01:28:50.858 --> 01:28:53.326
Now's not the time to fold.

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:58.390
<i>We shall prevail.</i>

01:29:03.638 --> 01:29:06.573
I obviously made a mistake.

01:29:09.143 --> 01:29:10.872
I made a mistake.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:14.373
I trusted.

01:29:15.316 --> 01:29:17.580
I believed.

01:29:19.053 --> 01:29:21.317
Family.

01:29:23.958 --> 01:29:27.621
Maybe a Mafia family.
You turn your back, and you get whacked.

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:32.129
Our guys come back from Japan
with this NEC...

01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:37.729
...and it's loaded with Microsoft programs.
Your Microsoft programs.

01:29:37.905 --> 01:29:40.567
They're almost identical to ours.

01:29:43.745 --> 01:29:46.475
There may be some similarities, Steve.

01:29:49.517 --> 01:29:51.178
Similarities?

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:56.955
Similarities?

01:29:59.193 --> 01:30:02.094
- Try theft.
- Steve, all cars have steering wheels...

01:30:02.263 --> 01:30:05.664
...but no one tries to claim
that the steering wheel was their invention.

01:30:05.833 --> 01:30:09.929
- We have a contract, you and I.
- Well, you should read it more carefully.

01:30:10.104 --> 01:30:11.935
What is this?

01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:14.807
This is like doing business with...

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:16.238
...like, a praying mantis.

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:19.471
You get seduced
and then eaten alive afterwards.

01:30:19.847 --> 01:30:21.974
Get real, will you?

01:30:23.651 --> 01:30:27.849
You and I are both like guys
that have this rich neighbor...

01:30:28.022 --> 01:30:30.115
...Xerox...

01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:32.589
...that left the door open all the time.

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:35.627
And you go sneaking in
to steal the TV set.

01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:40.330
Only when you get there,
you realize that I got there first.

01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:42.867
I got the loot, Steve!

01:30:43.638 --> 01:30:45.401
And you're yelling?

01:30:45.573 --> 01:30:48.201
"That's not fair.

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:51.470
I wanted to try to steal it first. "

01:30:57.118 --> 01:30:59.245
You're too late.

01:31:05.726 --> 01:31:08.092
We're better than you are.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:16.964
- We have better stuff.
- You don't get it, Steve.

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:20.633
That doesn't matter.

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:42.724
<i>You know, like a lot of things,
there always seems to be one last time.</i>

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:45.127
<i>For us, it was when we all
came together again...</i>

01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:48.029
<i>...for this big party
Steve threw for his 30th birthday.</i>

01:31:48.202 --> 01:31:50.227
<i>It was just one of those things.</i>

01:31:50.404 --> 01:31:53.202
<i>You know, where you try really hard
to make something work...</i>

01:31:53.374 --> 01:31:55.672
<i>...but somehow it just doesn't.</i>

01:31:55.843 --> 01:31:58.971
<i>And maybe you should have known it
all along.</i>

01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:06.477
- Is that really Ella Fitzgerald?
- I have absolutely no idea.

01:32:09.757 --> 01:32:11.657
You hear the kind of food
they're serving?

01:32:11.826 --> 01:32:14.420
- Salmon mousse, goat's cheese.
- I can't eat that stuff.

01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:17.826
- Why don't we go to Denny's?
- Is that Joan Baez with him?

01:32:17.999 --> 01:32:19.796
Wait, wait. Who's Joan Baez?

01:32:21.035 --> 01:32:23.162
- Hi.
- John.

01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:31.942
I need to talk to you. It's important.

01:32:32.113 --> 01:32:34.411
Okay, John. Excuse me.

01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:42.547
We've got a problem.
We've been asked to make a toast to Steve.

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:47.126
Me? Toast Steve? No way, man.
Not after what's happened. No way.

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:51.254
Oh, John, don't look at me. L...
Mike, you do it.

01:32:51.432 --> 01:32:55.027
After the past few months?
I don't think so.

01:32:55.636 --> 01:32:58.503
John, you're the one.

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:02.632
- No. Not now. Absolutely no way.
- Why not?

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:05.979
- Look, Steve thinks I'm his...
- He thinks you're what?

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:18.885
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast.

01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:21.218
To a remarkable man.

01:33:21.395 --> 01:33:23.226
A man who brought me
to this company...

01:33:23.731 --> 01:33:26.962
...without whom none of this tonight
would ever have happened.

01:33:27.134 --> 01:33:31.730
Steve Jobs, truly a guiding light.
A man who sees the future.

01:33:31.906 --> 01:33:33.134
- Hear, hear!
- Steve.

01:33:33.307 --> 01:33:34.604
Happy birthday!

01:33:40.881 --> 01:33:44.339
It's weird, but sometimes you find things
that are more important to you...

01:33:44.518 --> 01:33:48.352
...than the things you think are important.
You know what I mean?

01:33:48.522 --> 01:33:51.355
Maybe it's just getting older.

01:33:53.127 --> 01:33:57.325
Okay, guys. Let's see how we did.

01:33:58.699 --> 01:33:59.927
That's a good one.

01:34:11.812 --> 01:34:13.370
It's true.

01:34:14.715 --> 01:34:18.708
We're learning about the size of the sun
versus the size of the Earth.

01:34:31.032 --> 01:34:32.465
<i>Hi, Steve.</i>

01:34:32.633 --> 01:34:36.399
<i>I think it's gonna be really interesting,
I mean, you and me together.</i>

01:34:36.804 --> 01:34:38.635
Yeah.

01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:42.599
It is.
