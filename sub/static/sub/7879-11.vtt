You fellas interested

00:34.796 --> 00:36.140
in playing a little
b-ball after work today?

00:36.265 --> 00:37.357
I can't do it today.

00:37.482 --> 00:39.276
I'm going to a camping store
with my kids

00:39.401 --> 00:40.594
to get some new hiking equipment.

00:40.719 --> 00:42.459
Hey, how'd you get your kids
so into hiking?

00:42.625 --> 00:44.014
Well, Hayley's always loved
being outdoors,

00:44.139 --> 00:46.450
And Steve got into it
because I called it trekking,

00:46.575 --> 00:48.340
and he thought
Nimoy would be involved.

00:48.506 --> 00:50.133
You got a dumb nerd son, Stan.

00:50.299 --> 00:52.723
My ultimate goal is to climb this.

00:52.848 --> 00:54.763
Bret Michaels?

00:54.929 --> 00:57.808
Kilimanjaro.

00:57.974 --> 00:59.780
What magazine is that?

00:59.905 --> 01:01.455
<i>People.</i>

01:01.580 --> 01:03.867
Damn it!
Bullock just told me

01:03.992 --> 01:06.220
I can't do the Urban
Assault Vehicle presentation

01:06.345 --> 01:07.988
to the Joint Chiefs of Staff!

01:08.113 --> 01:09.189
What?!
Oh, come on!

01:09.314 --> 01:10.607
I think Bullock's right.

01:10.732 --> 01:12.092
You're too old.

01:12.217 --> 01:14.324
That's why I told Bullock
I'd do the presentation.

01:14.490 --> 01:16.410
Who are you to say I'm too old?!

01:16.638 --> 01:18.432
Ray, you microwaved
a sponge yesterday,

01:18.557 --> 01:19.950
thinking it was a Hot Pocket.

01:20.075 --> 01:22.119
You cooked it for 30 seconds,
flipped it over,

01:22.244 --> 01:23.754
and then cooked it
another 30 seconds.

01:23.879 --> 01:26.378
You had a lot of opportunities
to see it wasn't food.

01:26.544 --> 01:29.359
Stan, you're gonna be my age one day.

01:29.484 --> 01:31.829
We'll see how you feel then.

01:31.954 --> 01:34.928
Ray, when I'm your age, I want
to be dead for ten years.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.308
God, what is taking so long?

01:41.726 --> 01:43.841
What is this, Old Man Day?

01:43.966 --> 01:45.826
What a terrible holiday
that would be.

01:45.951 --> 01:48.402
Thousands of pigeons would die
from overfeeding.

01:50.568 --> 01:52.404
You're taking way
too long up here, buddy.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.418
I mean, what could you
possibly be buying?

01:54.543 --> 01:55.953
This isn't a pharmacy.

01:56.078 --> 01:57.321
Dad, go easy on this guy.

01:57.446 --> 01:58.702
I'm just being honest.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.591
Old people just get in the way.

02:00.716 --> 02:01.992
Their lives are worthless.

02:02.117 --> 02:03.894
Young people like me do things.

02:04.019 --> 02:05.896
I work. I contribute.

02:06.021 --> 02:07.865
I'm gonna climb
Mount Kilimanjaro one day.

02:07.990 --> 02:09.866
The only thing this geezer's
gonna climb into

02:09.991 --> 02:12.436
is a lukewarm bath
his Filipino nurse drew for him.

02:12.561 --> 02:14.671
He'll yell at her
for making it too hot,

02:14.796 --> 02:16.173
but she knows it's just right.

02:16.298 --> 02:17.574
She'll never win with this guy.

02:17.699 --> 02:18.909
She'll just cool it off,

02:19.034 --> 02:21.612
and then, he'll yell at her
for making it too cold.

02:21.737 --> 02:24.269
Thank God she has her
herb garden to keep her sane.

02:24.435 --> 02:27.063
You know, old people have
their place in society, Dad.

02:27.229 --> 02:28.993
Yeah, it's called a coffin.

What the hell did he just say to me?

02:48.246 --> 02:49.840
Well, it was in a foreign language,

02:49.965 --> 02:51.592
so it was probably
"Death to America."

02:51.717 --> 02:53.961
I think he said "I'm losing
the war against gingivitis."

02:54.086 --> 02:55.229
Whew.

02:55.354 --> 02:56.713

bitch, why did you drop me?

I can't breathe. Why

03:27.319 --> 03:28.917
and you still can't do that move!

How do you expect us to win
the Vizio $100,000 Dance-Off,

I'm getting it, and I'm dealing
with some serious wig problems.

03:40.298 --> 03:42.142
Why can't they make a good red wig?

03:42.267 --> 03:44.978
I look like Garfield had
a miscarriage on my head.

03:45.103 --> 03:47.605

Look, if you put your mind
to it, you <i>can</i> achieve it.

03:52.594 --> 03:53.837

03:56.652 --> 03:58.709
And this is called Fine Ass City.

03:58.834 --> 04:02.158
One
policeman's flashlight.

04:09.678 --> 04:11.855
Ugh, I look terrible.

04:11.980 --> 04:14.963
I look like Chelsea Handler
12 years ago.

04:17.219 --> 04:18.632
Uh. What... What time is it?

04:18.798 --> 04:20.514
7:45.

04:20.639 --> 04:21.982
You've been sleeping
through <i>Monk</i> repeats

04:22.107 --> 04:23.430
and cutting wake-up farts.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.185

04:25.310 --> 04:27.287
I know, you're acting so stupid, man.

04:34.469 --> 04:35.495
Oh, I'm up!

04:37.639 --> 04:39.666
Stan, you look horrible.

04:39.791 --> 04:41.868
And he's acting so stupid, man.

04:41.993 --> 04:43.770
I think you should see a doctor.

04:43.895 --> 04:46.173
Maybe we shouldn't go
to the dance contest.

04:46.298 --> 04:48.041
Nonsense.
He's fine.

04:48.166 --> 04:51.078
All you need to worry about is
dancing your little fanny off.

04:51.203 --> 04:52.346
See a doctor immediately.

04:52.471 --> 04:54.294
You're obviously dying.

04:57.943 --> 05:01.259
Well, Mr. Smith,
it seems that you have aged.

05:01.425 --> 05:02.556
I have AIDS?!

05:02.681 --> 05:03.824
No, no, not AIDS.

05:03.949 --> 05:05.158
You've aged.

05:05.283 --> 05:06.426
I'm being paged?

05:06.551 --> 05:08.061
No, not paged. <i>Aged.</i>

05:08.186 --> 05:09.763
I have AIDS?! Again?!

05:09.888 --> 05:11.014
This should help your hearing,

05:11.139 --> 05:12.520
but more importantly, end this bit.

05:12.686 --> 05:14.918
Mr. Smith, my concern is
that two months ago,

05:15.043 --> 05:16.286
you were in great health,

05:16.411 --> 05:18.889
but now you have the body
of a 75-year-old man.

05:19.014 --> 05:19.990
What?!

05:20.115 --> 05:22.059
You're aging at an alarming rate.

05:22.184 --> 05:23.193
How did this happen?!

05:23.318 --> 05:24.528
Well, let's see.

05:24.653 --> 05:26.063
- Do you smoke?
- No.

05:26.188 --> 05:28.432
Are you President
of the United States?

05:28.557 --> 05:30.133
No.

05:30.258 --> 05:31.902
Mm-hmm.

05:32.027 --> 05:34.371
Have you been cursed
and/or hexed recently

05:34.496 --> 05:36.273
by someone old and/or magical?

05:36.398 --> 05:38.141
Dad, I think maybe that creepy guy

05:38.266 --> 05:39.609
at the camping store hexed you,

05:39.734 --> 05:41.478
and now you're
turning into an old man.

05:41.603 --> 05:42.846
Wait. Are hexes even real?

05:42.971 --> 05:44.314
I find that most things are.

05:44.439 --> 05:45.782
Y'all sayin' Texas ain't real?

05:45.907 --> 05:47.651
No. Hexes.

05:47.776 --> 05:49.486
Oh, okay, good, yeah.

05:49.611 --> 05:51.521
'Cause Texas is real,
that's for sure.

05:51.646 --> 05:54.191
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna have my penis removed,

05:54.316 --> 05:55.983
in the first of many painful steps

06:04.997 --> 06:06.458
Hey, what are you guys watching?

06:06.583 --> 06:08.080
Dad got hexed, so I rented a bunch

06:08.205 --> 06:10.950
of hex-based Disney movies
to figure out how to break it.

06:11.075 --> 06:12.664
First up is <i>Freaky Friday.</i>

06:12.830 --> 06:14.854
That's a body switching movie,
you dink.

06:14.979 --> 06:17.632
You want to learn about a hex,
watch <i>The Shaggy Dog.</i>

06:17.757 --> 06:19.224
You want to learn how to feel,

06:19.349 --> 06:22.382
I mean really feel,
watch <i>Marley & Me.</i>

06:22.548 --> 06:25.064
That phrase the old man
said to you was in Latin,

06:25.189 --> 06:26.732
but I can't find the translation.

06:26.857 --> 06:28.500
What did he say exactly?

06:28.625 --> 06:30.769
It was something <i>"in meus calceus,"</i>

06:30.894 --> 06:32.559
something <i>"mos agnosco."</i>

06:32.725 --> 06:35.841
<i>"Ingredior in meus calceus quod</i>
<i>vos mos agnosco."</i>

06:35.966 --> 06:38.310
It means, "Walk in my shoes,
and you will know."

06:38.435 --> 06:39.941
It's a really good hex.

06:40.107 --> 06:41.780
How do you knoso much about hexes?

06:41.905 --> 06:43.549
I do a lot of reading
because, you know,

06:43.674 --> 06:46.051
I sit in a (bleep)
bowl all (bleep) day.

06:46.176 --> 06:47.453
I'm not giving into this hex.

06:47.578 --> 06:49.221
I'm a young man, and by gum,

06:49.346 --> 06:51.023
I'm going to live like a young man!

06:51.148 --> 06:52.454
Did you just say "by gum"?

06:52.620 --> 06:53.850
Aah!

06:59.273 --> 07:01.517
Okay. Radical.

07:01.642 --> 07:04.086
Okay, what's with the getup, Stan?

07:04.211 --> 07:06.422
I just got back
from Beer Pong Coachella,

07:06.547 --> 07:09.124
and didn't have time to change.

07:09.249 --> 07:10.993
Why, hello, Shia LaBeouf.

07:11.118 --> 07:12.327
I loved youu in <i>Holes.</i>

07:12.452 --> 07:13.829
I'm joking, Smith.

07:13.954 --> 07:15.164
I knew it was you.

07:15.289 --> 07:16.265
You look ridiculous.

07:16.390 --> 07:17.599
Now let's go.

07:17.724 --> 07:19.702
It's time to demonstrate
the Urban Assault Vehicle

07:19.827 --> 07:21.003
to the Joint Chiefs.

07:21.128 --> 07:23.026
Is that a hearing aid in your ear?

07:23.192 --> 07:25.340
No. It's my Bluetooth.

07:25.465 --> 07:26.792
Yo, what up, Slick?

07:26.917 --> 07:28.193
It's my homey, Slick.

07:28.318 --> 07:30.295
All right then, Slick.

07:32.022 --> 07:34.466
Stan, you didn't
tell Slick I said hello.

07:34.591 --> 07:38.374
Slick was my homey
long before he was yours.

07:43.433 --> 07:45.160
Okay, here's today's itinerary.

07:45.285 --> 07:47.663
We check into the hotel,
I shower real quick,

07:47.788 --> 07:50.199
then we go to the hotel's
common room to rehearse.

07:50.324 --> 07:53.035
I'm still a little nervous about
getting that dance move down.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.286
You'll get it.

07:54.411 --> 07:56.162
Remember, it's all about tenacity.

08:01.285 --> 08:02.678
Why are we stopping here?

08:02.803 --> 08:05.013
Francine, I haven't been
entirely truthful with you.

08:05.138 --> 08:06.849
There is no dance competition.

08:06.974 --> 08:09.084
What?!
You mean they cancelled it?

08:09.209 --> 08:10.532
No, it never existed.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.521
You see, a dear friend
of mine's been sick,

08:12.646 --> 08:15.657
and I needed a way to make sure
you'd come with me to Louisville

08:15.782 --> 08:17.092
when she finally passed away.

08:17.217 --> 08:18.677
You know, for emotional support.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.375
This seemed easier
than just asking you.

08:20.541 --> 08:22.915
Uh, I... I...
I don't understand.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.551
We've been rehearsing for six months.

08:25.676 --> 08:27.549
Look... Look what I'm wearing!

08:27.715 --> 08:28.871
I know.

08:28.996 --> 08:30.439
You're gonna look ridiculous.

08:30.564 --> 08:32.607
I was going to pack
you something dressy,

08:32.732 --> 08:34.860
but then I decided to
pack my ukulele instead.

08:36.886 --> 08:38.738
I suck at this.

08:44.126 --> 08:46.038
Gentlemen, our finest agent,
Stan Smith,

08:46.163 --> 08:49.207
will demonstrate
the 2010 Urban Assault Vehicle.

08:52.489 --> 08:53.783
Crab apples!

08:53.949 --> 08:57.432
Gentlemen, it's the
fastest tank we've ever built.

08:57.557 --> 08:59.535
Tops over 90 miles an hour.

09:23.312 --> 09:25.010
Smith, you have
the emergency brake on.

09:25.135 --> 09:26.862
Release it now!

09:38.565 --> 09:40.058
Code Red!

09:42.331 --> 09:44.094
That went well.

09:44.219 --> 09:46.715
Is that your revenge, Ray? Hmm?

09:46.840 --> 09:48.975
Saying that line to me?

09:54.414 --> 09:56.892
Why is everybody staring at us?

09:57.017 --> 10:00.519
Maybe 'cause we're at a funeral,
and you got your taters out.

10:05.542 --> 10:08.316
You've got some nerve coming here.

10:08.482 --> 10:11.156
Roger, what is going on here?

10:11.281 --> 10:13.292
Francine, I haven't been
entirely truthful with you.

10:13.417 --> 10:15.294
The woman who died
wasn't exactly a friend.

10:15.419 --> 10:16.461
She was my ex-wife.

10:16.586 --> 10:18.096
What?!

10:18.221 --> 10:20.515
Unfortunately, I left her
when she was terminally ill.

10:20.640 --> 10:21.850
I hate you.

10:21.975 --> 10:23.101
Settle down, Vincent.

10:23.226 --> 10:25.103
Vincent was my stepson
for a brief time.

10:25.228 --> 10:26.889
How's online college, Vincent?

10:27.014 --> 10:29.315
You a court reporter yet?

10:33.632 --> 10:35.797
Dad, wha-what's wrong?

10:35.922 --> 10:38.054
The CIA put me on temporary leave.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.768
What?! Why?!

10:39.893 --> 10:41.336
Oh, I-I filed something wrong.

10:41.461 --> 10:42.671
It-It certainly wasn't

10:42.796 --> 10:44.406
because I killed the
Secretary of Defense.

10:44.531 --> 10:46.508
Oh, Dad, I'm so sorry.

10:46.633 --> 10:48.577
They also said I have dementia.

10:48.702 --> 10:50.566
You know what?

10:50.732 --> 10:52.147
They're right to do it.

10:52.272 --> 10:54.149
I'm a useless old man.

10:54.274 --> 10:55.951
I have no sense of temperature,

10:56.076 --> 10:58.086
I got a pocket full of wet hankies,

10:58.211 --> 11:00.055
and all I want is 45 more seconds

11:00.180 --> 11:01.657
to speak at a town council meeting.

11:01.782 --> 11:02.925
Just hang in there, Dad.

11:03.050 --> 11:04.914
We'll figure out
how to break this hex.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.595
You know, in every classic hex movie,

11:06.720 --> 11:09.698
the victim has to prove himself
by performing some grand feat.

11:09.823 --> 11:11.466
For example, in <i>The Santa Clause,</i>

11:11.591 --> 11:13.802
Tim Allen had to deliver
all of Santa's presents

11:13.927 --> 11:16.592
on Christmas Eve
to break his cocaine hex.

11:16.758 --> 11:18.540
Wait.
What did the old man say again?

11:18.665 --> 11:20.742
Something about walking
a mile in his shoes.

11:20.867 --> 11:23.545
Walk a mile in his shoes.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.102
Kilimanjaro!

11:26.268 --> 11:28.483
He wants me to climb Kilimanjaro!

11:28.608 --> 11:31.119
But in <i>his</i> shoes...
as an old man!

11:31.244 --> 11:32.688
I don't know about that, Dad.

11:32.813 --> 11:34.777
No, no, no, Stan might be right here.

11:34.943 --> 11:37.780
He <i>did</i> tell the old man in
the store he was gonna climb it.

11:37.946 --> 11:39.328
How did <i>you</i> hear about that?

11:39.453 --> 11:41.163
My buddy Phil works there
part-time selling sleeping bags.

11:41.288 --> 11:43.298
The rest of the week
he's out in the woods

11:43.423 --> 11:44.533
banging married chicks.

11:44.658 --> 11:46.802
I don't think Phil's
ever gonna grow up.

11:46.927 --> 11:48.971
You know what, Dad?
If climbing Kilimanjaro

11:49.096 --> 11:51.940
is what you think you need to do,
we'll help you.

11:52.065 --> 11:53.709
Right, Hayley?
Sure, Dad.

11:53.834 --> 11:56.011
You kids are all right!

12:07.681 --> 12:09.524
You really loved her, didn't you?

12:09.649 --> 12:11.293
Yeah, we had fun.

12:11.418 --> 12:12.961
She pushed me to do things,

12:13.086 --> 12:15.197
like take adult education classes.

12:15.322 --> 12:17.532
The last one was
Native American Tribal Law.

12:17.657 --> 12:19.301
I challenge you to find

12:19.426 --> 12:21.837
a bigger waste of time than that.

12:21.962 --> 12:23.672
Ah...

12:23.797 --> 12:25.624
Okay, Frannie, we're
digging this stiff up.

12:25.749 --> 12:27.259
What? Why?!

12:27.384 --> 12:29.494
Francine, I haven't been
entirely truthful with you.

12:29.619 --> 12:31.930
- Oh, my God!
- I really brought you here

12:32.055 --> 12:34.900
because I need someone to help
me dump her body in Shelby Lake.

12:35.025 --> 12:36.964
I-I'm not doing that!

12:37.130 --> 12:39.054
Look, her folks want her
buried in the family plot,

12:39.179 --> 12:40.722
but she told me
her final resting place

12:40.847 --> 12:42.124
should be in water.

12:42.249 --> 12:44.543
Shelby Lake was where
we went on our first date.

12:44.668 --> 12:46.044
Ah, we had a picnic.

12:46.169 --> 12:48.046
As the sun set, we made love.

12:48.171 --> 12:49.518
It was awful.

12:49.643 --> 12:50.812
I just laid there.

12:50.978 --> 12:52.884
Th-Th-Th-This is insane!

12:53.009 --> 12:54.152
I'm leaving!

12:54.277 --> 12:55.566
Francine, wait!

12:55.732 --> 12:58.590
I know I was a bad husband
to her in life, but...

12:58.715 --> 13:01.159
maybe I can be a good one
to her in death.

13:01.284 --> 13:02.885
It's my last shot at redemption.

13:04.087 --> 13:06.998
Okay, Roger.

13:07.123 --> 13:09.434
But no more lies.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.236
Thanks, Francine.

13:11.361 --> 13:13.512
Now grab a shovel and dig.

13:14.614 --> 13:16.465
Okay, lunch!

13:21.234 --> 13:22.635
Mmm.

13:25.345 --> 13:26.501
All right, kids.

13:26.626 --> 13:29.061
Let's climb that mountain
and break that hex!

13:30.630 --> 13:32.498
Pee break.

13:47.714 --> 13:49.841
Ow!

13:49.966 --> 13:52.177
Oh, look at the little guy.
He's still alive.

13:52.456 --> 13:53.545
Oh, yeah.

13:53.670 --> 13:54.579
Resilient little fella.

13:56.506 --> 13:57.649
We should kill him.

13:57.774 --> 13:59.217
Put him out of his misery.

13:59.342 --> 14:01.787
Yeah, I'm sure he'd rather
be dead than live like this.

14:01.912 --> 14:03.188
Oh, my God!

14:03.313 --> 14:05.190
They took me out here to kill me.

14:05.315 --> 14:06.875
They don't believe
me climbing Kilimanjaro

14:07.000 --> 14:08.460
will break the curse.

14:08.585 --> 14:10.862
They think I'm gonna be
a burden on them forever.

14:10.987 --> 14:12.998
You gonna take me
out here and shoot me?

14:13.123 --> 14:14.382
Well, guess what, kids?

14:14.507 --> 14:16.685
I'm gonna kill you
before you kill me.

14:16.810 --> 14:19.357
Your old man's got a few tricks up...

14:19.482 --> 14:21.123
Ah!

14:21.248 --> 14:23.425
Oh, that's good.
That's so good.

14:23.550 --> 14:26.282
My kids are so dead.
This is so good.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.082
Dad, you should eat something.

14:35.248 --> 14:37.710
Yeah, I'm not really hungry
for poison.

14:37.876 --> 14:39.446
Steve's right.
You're gonna need your strength

14:39.571 --> 14:42.182
if we're gonna make it to the
top of the mountain tomorrow.

14:42.307 --> 14:43.466
Whoops! Sorry!

14:43.591 --> 14:45.135
I'm just a shaky old man.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.870
Can't control my body or my mouth.

14:46.995 --> 14:48.121
Too many Mexicans!

14:48.246 --> 14:49.389
See?

14:49.514 --> 14:50.874
I don't even believe that.

14:50.999 --> 14:52.542
I believe it a little.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.600
Which one should I do first?

15:00.725 --> 15:02.902
Steve.

15:04.486 --> 15:05.538
Sorry, kiddo.

15:05.663 --> 15:07.524
I'm getting to the
top of the mountain

15:07.649 --> 15:10.267
and breaking that curse, and
you kids aren't gonna stop me.

15:15.757 --> 15:17.591
Hey, Papa.

15:19.093 --> 15:21.371
Looks like you did a little
sleepwalking last night.

15:21.496 --> 15:23.373
You had a knife, and we figured

15:23.498 --> 15:24.674
you were gonna whittle something,

15:24.799 --> 15:27.977
so, we went ahead and did it for you.

15:28.102 --> 15:31.664
It's the five hosts of <i>Family Feud,</i>

15:31.789 --> 15:33.767
from Richard Dawson
through Steve Harvey.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.769
You forgot John O'Hurley.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.979
I told you!

15:40.689 --> 15:43.067
What is this?

15:43.233 --> 15:44.727
Sorry. My neck boil burst.

15:44.852 --> 15:46.720
Yuck! Don't get old, huh?

15:51.092 --> 15:53.860
Oops, guess there was
more boil juice in there.

15:58.616 --> 16:00.835
Shish kebab time.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.801
Papa? Hey, Papa?

16:07.926 --> 16:10.003
Papa, we found you holding a lighter.

16:10.128 --> 16:11.938
Bon Jovi's not here, Papa.

16:12.063 --> 16:14.223
You're on a mountain.

16:16.892 --> 16:19.212
I can't believe I'm saying this,

16:19.337 --> 16:21.781
but I admire what you're doing here.

16:21.906 --> 16:24.083
In fact, this might
be the most noble thing

16:24.208 --> 16:26.252
you've ever done.

16:26.377 --> 16:28.500
Francine, I haven't been
entirely truthful with you.

16:28.625 --> 16:30.046
Oh, come on!

16:30.171 --> 16:31.891
I don't really know where
she wanted to be buried.

16:32.016 --> 16:33.492
Hell, I don't even remember her name.

16:33.658 --> 16:36.753
But one thing I do remember
is her hair.

16:39.324 --> 16:42.669
I told you that no one
makes a decent red wig these days.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.554
So I had to go find my own.

16:44.679 --> 16:47.048
Took her years to finally croak,
but it was worth the wait.

17:01.029 --> 17:03.072
You're pretty happy, aren't you?

17:03.197 --> 17:04.607
I am content, yes.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.709
This whole trip was
completely ridiculous,

17:06.834 --> 17:08.243
but you actually proved your point.

17:08.368 --> 17:09.569
What point was that?

17:09.736 --> 17:11.214
About being tenacious.

17:11.339 --> 17:15.326
You wanted a red wig so you did
everything you could to get it.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.954
Oh, yeah, so I did.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.388
Pull over.

17:19.513 --> 17:21.247
I want to try the move.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.001
♪

17:24.166 --> 17:26.587
Five, six, seven, eight...

17:31.424 --> 17:33.594
You did it!

17:34.679 --> 17:36.456
You did it!

17:36.581 --> 17:38.432
For absolutely no reason at all!

17:38.598 --> 17:42.144
Roger, I haven't been entirely
truthful with you.

17:42.310 --> 17:45.981
The only reason
I wanted to do the move

17:46.147 --> 17:48.084
is so I could do this!

17:48.209 --> 17:50.253
I have the car keys in my pocket,

17:50.378 --> 17:52.612
you stupid bitch...

17:56.950 --> 17:58.711
I'm worried about Dad.

17:58.836 --> 18:00.113
Where did he go now?

18:00.238 --> 18:02.048
He said something about Orientals,

18:02.173 --> 18:03.600
then went to find a toothpick.

18:03.725 --> 18:04.834
Dad?

18:04.959 --> 18:06.102
Dad?!

18:06.227 --> 18:07.303
Papa?!

18:07.428 --> 18:08.879
Help! Children!

18:09.045 --> 18:10.857
I've lost my equilibrium!

18:10.982 --> 18:12.308
Dad, are you okay?

18:12.433 --> 18:14.160
Thank you for helping an old man.

18:14.285 --> 18:15.361
Now this!

18:15.486 --> 18:16.512
Ow!

18:16.678 --> 18:18.305
What are you doing?!

18:18.471 --> 18:20.099
Killing you before you kill me!

18:22.476 --> 18:24.153
No one's trying to kill you.

18:24.278 --> 18:25.479
You have dementia.

18:25.645 --> 18:26.564
Crab apples.

18:41.369 --> 18:43.747
Oh, God!

18:46.708 --> 18:47.960
I'm almost at the top.

18:51.806 --> 18:53.883
I did it.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.268
I reached the top.

18:55.393 --> 18:57.077
Make me young again.

18:58.713 --> 18:59.889
What the heck?

19:00.014 --> 19:01.056
Oh, no!

19:01.222 --> 19:02.992
Oh! Ow! Aw!

19:03.117 --> 19:04.951
Help!

19:15.236 --> 19:16.739
Still?

19:16.864 --> 19:18.157
Really?

19:18.323 --> 19:19.825
Still falling.

19:39.454 --> 19:41.931
Good boy.

19:42.056 --> 19:43.766
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

19:43.932 --> 19:45.651
No. I didn't break the hex.

19:45.776 --> 19:47.019
I'm still old.

19:47.185 --> 19:48.654
That's an understatement.

19:48.779 --> 19:50.023
You're ancient.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.357
What are you even doing out here,

19:51.482 --> 19:53.659
junking up the mountain
with your old bones.

19:53.784 --> 19:54.994
Hey...

19:55.119 --> 19:56.679
You should be at home, man,

19:56.804 --> 19:59.832
sitting on a super-padded
toilet seat, right, right,

19:59.957 --> 20:01.868
farting out your soup, uh-huh,

20:01.993 --> 20:04.703
while your gross yellow toenails
click on the linoleum.

20:04.869 --> 20:06.055
That's not very nice.

20:06.180 --> 20:07.223
Or fair.

20:07.348 --> 20:08.666
I just climbed that mountain.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.693
Did you really climb it?

20:10.818 --> 20:13.003
Or are you just having
another "senior moment"?

20:13.169 --> 20:16.132
Hey, listen,
I used to think like you, too,

20:16.257 --> 20:18.034
but I wrong.

20:18.159 --> 20:20.203
I accomplished a big dream
of mine today,

20:20.328 --> 20:22.555
and I did it as an old man.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.844
I admit it, it's not fun being old,

20:24.969 --> 20:27.482
but we can still live rich,
productive lives.

20:29.068 --> 20:32.248
Dude, you're dying, you're
going to Heaven right now.

20:32.373 --> 20:33.816
Hey, if you see my grandma,

20:33.941 --> 20:36.869
ask her why her breath was so nasty.

20:36.994 --> 20:40.406
No, I'm not dying, I broke the hex!

20:40.531 --> 20:44.944
Your elder abuse made me realize
how it truly feels to be old.

20:45.069 --> 20:48.147
That's what the old man wanted
me to learn... sympathy.

20:48.272 --> 20:50.450
Or empathy.
Whichever one fits.

20:50.575 --> 20:51.634
Kids.
Kids, look.

20:51.759 --> 20:52.869
I broke the hex.

20:52.994 --> 20:54.169
I'm getting young again.

20:54.335 --> 20:55.905
That's really great, Dad.

20:56.030 --> 20:59.091
Yeah, Dad, we're
really proud of... Oh.

20:59.257 --> 21:01.034
What? What now?

21:03.303 --> 21:04.750
All right, Dad, think.

21:04.875 --> 21:08.008
What was the last interaction
you had with a black person?

21:09.069 --> 21:13.647
It was at the T-Mobile store,
and it was not positive.
