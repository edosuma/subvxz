Okay, then that

03:54.701 --> 03:55.902

03:55.902 --> 03:57.370

She really stepped up

04:32.973 --> 04:33.974
<i>and physically tried</i>

<i>to handle the ball.</i>

ASHLEE:
<i>Since Maddie has been absent,</i>

05:02.402 --> 05:03.770
<i>Brynn has been asked to dance</i>

<i>as a guest on the team.</i>
<i>If she keeps</i>

05:22.689 --> 05:24.224
Yes. It's the live critiques.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.259
I like it.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.061
So,

05:28.061 --> 05:29.229
the solos

05:29.229 --> 05:31.331
go to two girls
whose mothers

05:31.331 --> 05:33.233
think that they are

05:33.233 --> 05:35.735
the number‐two girl.
Maddie's not here,

05:35.735 --> 05:37.404
this is your go‐to girl.

05:37.404 --> 05:39.739
If Maddie can't do
it, she can do it.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.511
Kendall,

05:44.511 --> 05:46.680
the first solo

05:46.680 --> 05:48.048
is going to you.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.184
(applause)

05:51.184 --> 05:53.253
The name of your routine is

05:53.253 --> 05:54.921
"Meltdown."

05:54.921 --> 05:57.858
Now, you had a little meltdown
in here the other day.

06:00.460 --> 06:03.463
I don't want to see
that ever happen again.

06:03.463 --> 06:05.232
My next solo

06:05.232 --> 06:06.933

06:06.933 --> 06:08.835
(cheering)
MELISSA:
Yay!

06:08.835 --> 06:11.538
And the name
of the solo

06:11.538 --> 06:13.473
is "All I Want to Do

06:13.473 --> 06:15.642
is Sit on the Couch
and Eat Chips."

06:15.642 --> 06:18.211
(laughter)

06:18.211 --> 06:20.480
MELISSA:
<i>When Mackenzie was, like, six,</i>
<i>she made a joke</i>

06:20.480 --> 06:22.349

"All I want to do is eat chips.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.050
I don't want to go on Broadway."

06:24.050 --> 06:25.719
I don't want to go on Broadway.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.021
All I want to do is just...

06:28.021 --> 06:30.290
stay home and eat chips.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.958
People made T‐shirts about it.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.227
Near the end of last season,
you beat Maddie.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.464
<i>But instead of taking</i>
<i>that little win and saying,</i>

06:37.464 --> 06:40.300
<i>"You know what, I am gonna</i>
<i>prove every one of them wrong.</i>

06:40.300 --> 06:41.601
"My leg is gonna be higher
than Maddie's.

06:41.601 --> 06:42.802
"I'm gonna jump higher
than Maddie's.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.137
"Every trick
that she has,

06:44.137 --> 06:45.739

that trick, too."

06:45.739 --> 06:47.941
Instead,

06:47.941 --> 06:49.175
I don't know what you did.

06:49.175 --> 06:50.877
MELISSA:
You've been
her teacher,

06:50.877 --> 06:53.380
so you know her strengths.
But the weaknesses
that she had at eight

06:53.380 --> 06:56.249
and nine should not be
the same weaknesses now.
I agree.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.517
The weakness now should be

06:57.517 --> 06:59.452
balancing
on the eighth pirouette.

06:59.452 --> 07:02.055
I don't think many of us
can do eight pirouettes.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.191
I didn't ask you to, Melissa.

07:05.191 --> 07:06.893
MELISSA:
I'm just saying.
What is going on with you?

07:06.893 --> 07:08.995
I'm done being quiet.
She could be
1,000 times better,

07:08.995 --> 07:10.730
and I want her
to be better.
Okay, then help her.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.199
And you just make one excuse
after the other after the other.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.267
Then help her.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.435
Let your talent speak
for itself,

07:15.435 --> 07:17.170
not your mother's mouth.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.639
HOLLY:
<i>Who is this woman?</i>

07:19.639 --> 07:23.643
For the first time, I'm
really seeing Melissa stand up

07:23.643 --> 07:27.914

07:27.914 --> 07:29.716

07:29.716 --> 07:32.752
The third
solo is going

07:34.721 --> 07:36.723
(cheering, applause)

07:36.723 --> 07:41.461
Your character

07:44.898 --> 07:46.366
Oh!

07:46.366 --> 07:48.335
All three solos
this week

07:48.335 --> 07:52.806
will be competing against
each other for a solo

07:52.806 --> 07:55.809
in next week's
competition.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.011
The group routine,

07:58.011 --> 08:00.380
the name of it is
"Hungry Like the Wolves."

08:00.380 --> 08:02.615
Wooh, ha... really cool.
JESSALYNN: Oh.

08:02.615 --> 08:05.552
Now, I don't see
that hunger,

08:05.552 --> 08:06.586
that desire.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.688
I need everybody
in this room to get

08:08.688 --> 08:10.690
a little hungrier for that win.

08:10.690 --> 08:13.326
I'm talking about

08:13.326 --> 08:15.895
you wanting to work
on your feet, you wanting

08:15.895 --> 08:18.798
to work on your
flexibility.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.467
I want to see
more improvement,

08:20.467 --> 08:24.404
because Abby Lee's kids
do it all. And you need

08:24.404 --> 08:25.672
to do it all well.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.874
The world thinks

08:27.874 --> 08:30.410
that I struck gold
with this group.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.078
I disagree.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.446
Listen up,

08:33.446 --> 08:35.915
'cause your life is
about to change.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.422
I'm going to form
a new team.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.093
I have looked at minis
all over the country.

08:47.093 --> 08:49.729
I liked my minis.

08:49.729 --> 08:51.798
<i>I'm forming a new mini team.</i>

08:51.798 --> 08:55.035
I want girls between the ages
of six and eight.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.071
<i>They're fresh, eager,</i>
<i>and moldable.</i>

08:58.071 --> 08:59.572
<i>And, besides,</i>
<i>twice as many teams</i>

08:59.572 --> 09:02.842
means twice as many wins here
in L. A.

09:02.842 --> 09:04.177
Why bring in minis now?

09:04.177 --> 09:05.912
Are you saying
that these kids are...

09:05.912 --> 09:08.581
washed up?
I need to keep doing
what I do.

09:08.581 --> 09:10.650
So that would be
starting with minis

09:10.650 --> 09:11.951
and...

09:11.951 --> 09:15.655
training them to be
a junior elite competition team.

09:15.655 --> 09:18.491
And so on
and so forth.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.326
Okay? All right,

09:20.326 --> 09:22.062
we're gonna get ready
for the group dance.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.631
Girls, come on.
Last week was a gift.

09:25.765 --> 09:26.966
HOLLY:
<i>I'm incredibly frustrated.</i>

09:26.966 --> 09:28.635
<i>These kids have worked so hard,</i>

09:28.635 --> 09:30.670
<i>and right at the time</i>
<i>where they are beginning</i>

09:30.670 --> 09:33.039
to really make a name
for themselves,

09:33.039 --> 09:37.210
<i>she's going to be focused</i>
<i>on a new team of kids.</i>

09:37.210 --> 09:39.512
ABBY LEE: <i>This is</i>
<i>"Hungry Like the Wolves."</i>

09:39.512 --> 09:41.014
<i>You're doing...</i>

09:41.014 --> 09:42.482
a character piece.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.884
It's not light,
it's not fluffy‐‐ it's...

09:44.884 --> 09:47.120
real.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.722
Why would she turn her back
and then go to a petite team?

09:49.722 --> 09:51.324
Right when these kids
are about to peak,

09:51.324 --> 09:52.759
she's gonna turn her back
on them.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.594
HOLLY: <i>I don't know.</i>
<i>She did this before‐‐</i>

09:54.594 --> 09:57.130
<i>the Select Team‐‐</i>
<i>and that didn't last.</i>

09:57.130 --> 09:58.865
I don't know how
she's going to have

09:58.865 --> 10:00.400
the stamina to work
with the minis.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.202
JILL: <i>They're going to be</i>
<i>the shiny new toy,</i>

10:02.202 --> 10:04.871
<i>and the old one gets shoved...</i>
<i>it's the</i> Velveteen Rabbit.

10:08.208 --> 10:11.644
Why does Mackenzie
not know what she's doing here?

10:11.644 --> 10:13.746
ABBY LEE:
<i>I am not picking on you.</i>

10:13.746 --> 10:15.782
You know that you didn't know
what you were doing right there.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.016
Stop sitting there
watching everybody else

10:17.016 --> 10:18.785
get better. Work.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.753
<i>Let's get it together.</i>
MELISSA: Guess what?
Mackenzie's

10:20.753 --> 10:22.122
<i>a good little dancer‐‐</i>
<i>she doesn't dance</i>

10:22.122 --> 10:23.823
like the other girls,
'cause she's little.

10:23.823 --> 10:26.126
And she's only danced
at the Abby Lee Dance Company.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.294
So fix her flaws.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.163
Melissa, I want to know
what you were drinking

10:30.163 --> 10:31.731
before you went
into that dance studio,

10:31.731 --> 10:33.533
'cause you were fired up‐‐
and I was like,

10:33.533 --> 10:35.468
"I like this Melissa!
She would not be quiet."

10:35.468 --> 10:37.570
Well, no, the
reason being,

10:37.570 --> 10:40.173
just because she wanted
her to jump up higher.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.741
Maddie is
eight inches taller than her.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.510
How is she gonna jump

10:43.510 --> 10:45.311
higher than Maddie?
I really like that,
Melissa,

10:45.311 --> 10:46.913
that you were
standing up for Mackenzie...

10:46.913 --> 10:49.282
JILL: <i>You were not gonna let</i>
<i>Abby get the last word.</i>

10:49.282 --> 10:51.818
I just wanted to let Mackenzie
know that I'm here for her,

10:51.818 --> 10:53.453
and I know Mackenzie's
gonna get mad at me,

10:53.453 --> 10:54.921
but it is what it is.

10:54.921 --> 10:59.125
All right, I saw some moments
that were incredible, Gianna.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.928
And then I saw
Mackenzie, who was...

11:01.928 --> 11:03.530
sitting on the couch
and eating chips.

11:03.530 --> 11:06.599
Ding‐dong.
Sit up, Mackenzie.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.668
Put your hands down
and look back.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.003
Thank you.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.005
And you'll notice
I'm not yelling at you.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.439
I found a
new victim.

11:13.439 --> 11:14.574
<i>I don't know</i>

would be teen appropriate?

15:04.604 --> 15:06.906
I can't say I see that.
A jazz solo

15:06.906 --> 15:10.042

probably is not...

15:10.042 --> 15:12.345

15:12.345 --> 15:14.280
give her something
that's competitive.

second, face the wall,

16:56.949 --> 16:58.417
So whatever.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.019
And what's the name
of your dance?

17:00.019 --> 17:02.889
It is called "I...
I Just Want to Stay at Home

17:02.889 --> 17:04.423
and Eat Chips."
No.

17:04.423 --> 17:07.593
She can't even remember
the name of the dance.

17:07.593 --> 17:10.696
"I Just Want to Sit on
the Couch and Eat Chips."

17:10.696 --> 17:13.132
Hence, the couch.

17:13.132 --> 17:16.035
Is this not a couch?
It could be a sofa.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.037
Could be a love seat.

17:20.139 --> 17:21.507
No.

17:21.507 --> 17:24.010
I thought it was "I Just Want
to Stay Home and Eat Chips."

17:24.010 --> 17:26.279
All I want to do is just...

17:26.279 --> 17:28.347
stay home and eat chips.

17:28.347 --> 17:29.882
Go.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.152
So, that little smart‐ass

17:33.152 --> 17:35.421
<i>is trying to tell me</i>
<i>that that's not the quote</i>

17:35.421 --> 17:37.056
that she said, that we're wrong.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.158
MELISSA:
<i>I'm not gonna have Abby</i>

17:39.158 --> 17:41.594
be mean to my daughter anymore.
I can't do it.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.296
<i>Abby's not perfect.</i>

17:43.296 --> 17:44.697
That's for (bleep) sure.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.966
Abby, why'd you call
Mackenzie a smart‐ass?

17:46.966 --> 17:49.035
Why? She just said...
Because she's trying
to contradict me ab...

17:49.035 --> 17:52.004
No, she said, "I thought it
was, 'I Want to Stay at Home

17:52.004 --> 17:54.740
and Eat Chips,'" because that's
what I thought it was, too.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.142
You don't have to
call her "smart‐ass."

17:56.142 --> 17:58.044
Well, but you didn't hear
the way she said it.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.111
MELISSA: Okay,
but I don't think

17:59.111 --> 18:00.613
you should call
her "smart‐ass."

18:00.613 --> 18:02.148
I'll never call her
anything again.

18:04.684 --> 18:08.187
She said, "Other kids would just
remember it in two minutes."
Kenzie. Kenzie. Kenzie. Kenzie.

18:08.187 --> 18:10.990
And she's like, "Okay, well,
we have 20 seconds done."
Kenzie, just calm down.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.692
KALANI:
Kenzie, you know
how this goes.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.460
She's just being mean
and rude like she always is.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.362
I just don't
want to do it!

18:16.362 --> 18:17.797
Abby needs to take something out
on someone,

18:17.797 --> 18:19.098
and she's taking it out on us.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.833
<i>But just leave</i>
<i>my daughter alone.</i>

18:20.833 --> 18:22.735
She doesn't want to mess
with me right now.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.537
<i>I know way too much.</i>

18:24.537 --> 18:25.771
I know so much stuff.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.909
<i>Hope she knows that.</i>

18:29.909 --> 18:31.744
ABBY LEE:

JESSALYNN:
<i>Abby needs to not act</i>
<i>like a crazed lunatic</i>

18:38.250 --> 18:40.319
<i>at this competition.</i>

18:40.319 --> 18:41.487
That's like taking a knife
and just like...

18:41.487 --> 18:44.190
(slashing sounds)
... in my chest.

18:53.947 --> 18:56.669
ABBY LEE:
<i>Kendall, everybody thinks</i>
<i>that this is just</i>

18:56.669 --> 18:59.071
another pretty face doing a
dance till the music starts.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.374
When you turn around and you
have all this aged makeup on,

19:01.374 --> 19:03.309
<i>and we hear that ding,</i>

19:03.309 --> 19:05.311
ding, ding.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.546
Then it's tragic.

19:15.221 --> 19:16.656
She needs to be more than that.

<i>She needs</i>

19:30.503 --> 19:32.471

(Jill groans,
Jessalynn laughs)

19:39.211 --> 19:41.981

19:41.981 --> 19:44.550
Up and toe. Pretty.

19:44.550 --> 19:47.153
She looks beautiful.
We like what we're doing.

19:47.153 --> 19:49.822
We enjoy the
process. It took

19:49.822 --> 19:51.590
forever with
Mackenzie on here.

19:51.590 --> 19:53.192
Like, she gets silly and dumb,

19:53.192 --> 19:55.061
and she just starts
jumping around

19:55.061 --> 19:56.429
instead of paying attention
to what we're saying.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.799
HOLLY:
<i>Typical Abby.</i>

19:59.799 --> 20:01.000
She's being
super friendly to Jill

20:01.000 --> 20:02.168
because she wants
to punish Melissa

20:02.168 --> 20:04.203
<i>for sticking up for Kenzie.</i>

20:04.203 --> 20:07.506
And I can tell Melissa's blood
is boiling right now.

20:07.506 --> 20:08.974
Don't you find it
interesting that

20:08.974 --> 20:10.710
Abby brought Jill in?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.611
Good for her. She should feel
good about herself.

20:12.611 --> 20:14.447
ABBY:
<i>Kendall, you could</i>

20:14.447 --> 20:16.148
make this dance a winner.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.651
What we're giving you‐‐
that's a winner.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.186
Hands down.

20:20.186 --> 20:21.587
You need to win.

20:21.587 --> 20:24.557
<i>Mackenzie!</i>

20:24.557 --> 20:27.593
Get on the tumble track,
and I don't want any attitude.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.495
Whether you think you're giving
me attitude or not, you were.

20:29.495 --> 20:31.030
And I'm not gonna
put up with that.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.732
<i>And if you cry, you</i>
<i>don't need to be here.</i>

20:32.732 --> 20:34.033
<i>You need to be in</i>

20:34.033 --> 20:36.736
the mini group,
'cause that's what minis do.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.704
Abby's being tough
on Mackenzie about

20:38.704 --> 20:41.073
<i>straightening her legs,</i>
<i>but we all know that she's</i>

20:41.073 --> 20:43.576
<i>taking out her legal problems</i>
<i>on Mackenzie right now.</i>

20:43.576 --> 20:45.911
And it hurts because I've always
been so loyal to her.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.013
I helped her so much
through the years.

20:48.013 --> 20:49.548
You have no idea.

20:49.548 --> 20:51.817
<i>I know that I'm a good friend,</i>
<i>and I'm a good person.</i>

20:51.817 --> 20:53.919
I can put my head down
on a pillow at night

20:53.919 --> 20:55.821
and sleep pretty good.
Yeah. Yeah.

20:55.821 --> 20:58.524
One, two, three. No.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.826
<i>Mackenzie!</i>
<i>You're a disappointment.</i>

21:00.826 --> 21:02.361
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Why don't you know that?</i>

21:02.361 --> 21:05.030
JILL:
<i>I bet Melissa is flipping out.</i>

21:05.030 --> 21:08.834
<i>She has supported Abby</i>
<i>through all of her legal woes.</i>

21:08.834 --> 21:10.402
I think she feels a little
betrayed,

21:10.402 --> 21:13.005
<i>and is really, really angry</i>
<i>at Abby.</i>

21:13.005 --> 21:15.407
ABBY LEE:
<i>Okay, do it the normal way.</i>

21:16.442 --> 21:18.377
See how crooked she gets?

21:18.377 --> 21:20.446
Fix it!
Fix it!

21:20.446 --> 21:21.914
MELISSA:
I don't know
how to fix it.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.015
ABBY LEE:
She... In the other room,

21:23.015 --> 21:25.251
she felt...
Was having a blast.

21:25.251 --> 21:26.685
ABBY LEE:
Stop making excuses for her,

21:26.685 --> 21:28.320
'cause you would have never
made an excuse for Maddie.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.122
I'm not making
excuses for her!
Yes, you do.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.590
<i>Everything I've said,</i>

21:31.590 --> 21:33.225
you have made an excuse about.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.194
HOLLY:
<i>Welcome to our world, Melissa.</i>

21:35.194 --> 21:36.695
<i>This is the behavior</i>

21:36.695 --> 21:38.697
that our girls are experiencing
on a regular basis.

21:38.697 --> 21:40.800

I don't... I just want
you to care about her

21:40.800 --> 21:42.067
like you used to, Abby.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.003
I care... I still
care about her.
I'm sorry.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.271
But I expect more from her.

21:45.271 --> 21:46.939
'Cause if Maddie
was any other kid

21:46.939 --> 21:49.074
in this country and
didn't dance, she wouldn't

21:49.074 --> 21:51.410
have been in a Sia video,
she wouldn't be in a movie.

21:51.410 --> 21:54.513

EMCEE:
I don't know.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.086
This competition's
gonna be pretty tight.

37:01.086 --> 37:03.054
What you got for us?

37:03.054 --> 37:04.856
I love the costume.
I think the costuming

37:04.856 --> 37:06.624
is awesome.
There was

37:06.624 --> 37:08.460
a little flub.
There was some floor work on

37:08.460 --> 37:10.562
the very beginning
where someone actually fell.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.164
Watch that.
Overall, I think it was

37:13.164 --> 37:14.332
an amazing job.

37:14.332 --> 37:16.201
Loved it.
Thank you, judges.

37:16.201 --> 37:17.669
(applause and cheering)

37:17.669 --> 37:19.671
The group dance
was really powerful.

37:19.671 --> 37:23.575
<i>I'm just really bummed that</i>
<i>Kendall tripped on her skirt,</i>

37:23.575 --> 37:25.910
<i>because, as it is,</i>
<i>Abby already thinks</i>

37:25.910 --> 37:27.879
<i>the girls aren't up</i>
<i>to their usual</i>

37:27.879 --> 37:29.280
<i>standards with their technique.</i>

37:29.280 --> 37:31.149
<i>The girls really</i>

37:31.149 --> 37:32.417
need to win today.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.185
EMCEE:
I think we're ready

37:34.185 --> 37:35.653
for some awards.
What do you say?

37:35.653 --> 37:39.657
Okay, junior solos today.

37:39.657 --> 37:41.626
In fourth place today...

37:49.634 --> 37:52.570
"I Just Want to Sit on the Couch
and Eat Chips." Mackenzie!

37:52.570 --> 37:55.240
Abby Lee Dance Company!

37:55.240 --> 37:58.076
ABBY LEE:
<i>Mackenzie ended up fourth.</i>

37:58.076 --> 37:59.277
She was less than perfect.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.379
<i>Melissa, your kid's feet</i>

38:01.379 --> 38:03.014
and legs suck, let's face it.

38:03.014 --> 38:05.850
EMCEE:
In third place...

38:10.054 --> 38:11.890
"The Meltdown." Kendall!

38:11.890 --> 38:13.858
Abby Lee Dance Company!

38:13.858 --> 38:18.163
JILL: <i>I'm very proud of Kendall</i>
<i>for getting third.</i>

38:18.163 --> 38:20.965
After manipulating
and managing her costume

38:20.965 --> 38:23.201
<i>and her face,</i>
<i>I'm proud of her.</i>

38:23.201 --> 38:24.702
EMCEE: All right, our top

38:24.702 --> 38:25.937
teen soloists.

38:29.274 --> 38:30.775
Third place...

38:32.343 --> 38:35.747
"Crazy Swing." Katrine,
Rhythmic Academy.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.182
(applause)

38:37.182 --> 38:39.417
Second place teen solo...

38:42.821 --> 38:45.256
"Cookie."
Nia, Abby Lee Dance Company!

38:45.256 --> 38:46.891
(applause and cheering)

38:46.891 --> 38:50.829
HOLLY: <i>Nia came in second place</i>
<i>in the teen division,</i>

38:50.829 --> 38:52.597
with a jazz solo

38:52.597 --> 38:54.098
<i>that probably</i>

38:54.098 --> 38:55.967
really shouldn't have been
in the teen division.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.135
I'm happy.

38:57.135 --> 39:01.272
The overall
group of the day.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.543
One point difference.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.112
Let's get that drumroll going.

39:13.418 --> 39:14.953
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:14.953 --> 39:17.522
"The Plus Divas."
Divine Dance Center!

39:17.522 --> 39:18.957
(applause and cheering)

39:18.957 --> 39:20.391
ABBY LEE:
<i>We lost the group.</i>

39:20.391 --> 39:22.627
<i>I hope this proves</i>
<i>to the mothers</i>

39:22.627 --> 39:24.529
<i>it's about technique,</i>
<i>and it's about</i>

39:24.529 --> 39:26.064
challenging these kids

39:26.064 --> 39:27.532
to push themselves.

39:27.532 --> 39:31.169
<i>This is season six.</i>

39:31.169 --> 39:34.038
There should be a first place
winner all the time.

39:34.038 --> 39:36.741
We did not have
a first place solo!

39:36.741 --> 39:40.044
So... if I'm reading
this correctly,

39:40.044 --> 39:43.281
Nia, you had a score of 292.

39:43.281 --> 39:48.253
Mackenzie, you had
a score of 295.5.

39:48.253 --> 39:53.157
Kendall, you had
a score of 295.7.

39:53.157 --> 39:55.293
So you are doing
the solo next week.

39:55.293 --> 39:58.563
HOLLY: <i>Nia placed second,</i>
<i>and Kendall came in third.</i>

39:58.563 --> 40:00.899
<i>We don't have</i>
<i>a competitive solo.</i>

40:00.899 --> 40:04.369
You're not gonna get
but so many points.

40:04.369 --> 40:06.070
It's impossible.

40:06.070 --> 40:09.340
<i>Kendall had a solo</i>
<i>that was designed to win.</i>

40:09.340 --> 40:11.776
Mackenzie, your mother
doesn't want another Maddie.

40:11.776 --> 40:13.177
She likes you
just the way you are.

40:13.177 --> 40:14.679
I don't.

40:14.679 --> 40:16.180
I want you
to get out there

40:16.180 --> 40:18.316
and be able to do
what she's doing.

40:18.316 --> 40:20.718
Well, I think this dance was too

40:20.718 --> 40:22.053
young for me,

40:22.053 --> 40:24.355
that's what I think, but...

40:24.355 --> 40:25.924
Well, that's why
we gave it to you.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.492
'Cause it's easy.

40:27.492 --> 40:30.061
I'm not gonna give you
a lyrical routine

40:30.061 --> 40:31.229
and tell you
to straighten your legs

40:31.229 --> 40:32.897
and point your
feet anymore.

40:32.897 --> 40:34.999
Because it's taking
too much out of us

40:34.999 --> 40:36.301
to do that.

40:36.301 --> 40:38.503
'Cause I have
a busy week,

40:38.503 --> 40:39.837
with my minis coming in.

40:39.837 --> 40:42.240
Oh, God, they're
coming next week?
Yes, they are.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.875
JILL:
<i>Abby needs to stay focused</i>

40:43.875 --> 40:45.476
and I don't mean

40:45.476 --> 40:46.911
<i>on the mini team.</i>

40:46.911 --> 40:47.912
<i>She's got a lot</i>

40:47.912 --> 40:49.180
going on right now.

40:49.180 --> 40:50.581
The whole world knows it.

40:50.581 --> 40:52.283
<i>She needs to worry</i>
<i>about herself,</i>

40:52.283 --> 40:54.419
<i>not a new team.</i>

40:54.419 --> 40:56.454
I don't want you to see yourself
as a lone wolf.

40:56.454 --> 40:57.989
We are your pack,

40:57.989 --> 40:59.991
we're part of the company...
ABBY LEE: Thank you, I know.

40:59.991 --> 41:02.527
We came here and I just
want to go on record

41:02.527 --> 41:03.628
in saying

41:03.628 --> 41:05.196
we're a part of a team,

41:05.196 --> 41:06.531
you're not a lone wolf.

41:06.531 --> 41:08.433
I want Abby to know
that she can talk to us

41:08.433 --> 41:09.834
<i>about her allegations.</i>

41:09.834 --> 41:10.802
<i>If she's convicted,</i>

41:10.802 --> 41:12.136
she could go to jail.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.172
She just can't pretend
that this doesn't exist.

41:14.172 --> 41:15.840
All I just wanted to say
is we're not

41:15.840 --> 41:17.542
letting Abby
face her troubles alone.

41:17.542 --> 41:19.410
Well, it's...

41:19.410 --> 41:21.045
Like, we're here.

41:21.045 --> 41:22.714
Well, actually,
I hate to break it to you all,

41:22.714 --> 41:23.715
but you might be there, too.

41:23.715 --> 41:25.049
All right.

41:25.049 --> 41:26.250
Let's go.

41:26.250 --> 41:27.852
What do you mean?

41:27.852 --> 41:29.287
Did Abby really just threaten us

41:29.287 --> 41:31.856
<i>and say we could be</i>
<i>going to jail, too?</i>

41:31.856 --> 41:33.658
That's just crazy,
even for Abby.

41:33.658 --> 41:36.227
The sooner she faces it

41:36.227 --> 41:38.396
and we can talk about it
and deal with it,

41:38.396 --> 41:39.731
instead of making
comments like

41:39.731 --> 41:40.732
"You're all going
with me..."

41:40.732 --> 41:41.733
HOLLY:
I'm kind of done.

41:41.733 --> 41:43.301
Like, you're
on you're own.

41:43.301 --> 41:44.702
JESSALYNN:
She's gonna have
a breakdown.

41:44.702 --> 41:46.371
I feel like it's
gonna, like, snap.

41:46.371 --> 41:48.740
She will.
And let's hope
it's not on our watch,

41:48.740 --> 41:50.908
because it's gonna hit big.

41:54.979 --> 41:56.347
ABBY LEE:
<i>Next on</i> Dance Moms...

41:56.347 --> 41:58.816

42:01.285 --> 42:03.421
HOLLY:
<i>So our kids can't do work</i>

42:03.421 --> 42:05.957
<i>because she's doing</i>
<i>something else with other kids?</i>

42:05.957 --> 42:06.991
ABBY LEE:
Kendall couldn't take

42:06.991 --> 42:08.760
anybody to the dark side.
I will.

42:08.760 --> 42:09.927

a (bleep) damn thing!

42:15.199 --> 42:16.901
HOLLY:

42:16.901 --> 42:18.603
<i>Her legal troubles</i>

42:18.603 --> 42:21.039
