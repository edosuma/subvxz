00:01.369 --> 00:04.036
<i> the people are represented</i>

00:04.038 --> 00:06.372
<i> by two separate</i>
<i> yet equally important groups:</i>

00:06.374 --> 00:08.307
<i> The police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:08.309 --> 00:11.543
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:11.545 --> 00:13.145
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:15.149 --> 00:16.148
We got you.

00:16.150 --> 00:19.151
I got you.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.386
What is it?

00:20.388 --> 00:23.122
Ooh, that's
a globe thistle pod

00:23.124 --> 00:24.790
from a globe thistle tree.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.291
Oh, okay.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.495
Oh, get real.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.630
I can't just leave
for lunch.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.632
Who says you
got to leave?

00:33.634 --> 00:36.235
I'm sure you've got
a peanut butter
sandwich for me.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.303
What have you got
to trade?

00:38.305 --> 00:40.572
Dinner in Soho, tonight?

00:40.574 --> 00:44.109
Okay, but I get
to keep my Twinkies.

00:44.111 --> 00:45.110
Hey, Tisha!

00:45.112 --> 00:49.114
Tisha, stay away
from the dog.

00:49.116 --> 00:50.516
That's not a stray.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.317
It has a collar.

00:52.319 --> 00:54.553
(<i> screaming</i> )

00:56.057 --> 00:57.222
Are you okay?

00:57.224 --> 00:58.390
Did he bite you?

00:58.392 --> 01:00.192
(<i> sobs</i> )

01:05.332 --> 01:06.532
(<i> gasps</i> )

01:14.108 --> 01:15.791
She's real cold.

01:15.792 --> 01:17.475
They say she's been
out here for hours.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.111
What is it-- a rape,
or a mugging?

01:19.113 --> 01:20.112
Don't know.
She's in bad shape.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.080
Skull's
fractured.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.082
Looks like she's
been choked.

01:23.084 --> 01:25.117
They think
she'll make it?

01:25.119 --> 01:26.669
I don't know.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.220
They can barely
find blood pressure.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.488
Hey, guys, move.

01:29.490 --> 01:30.622
Where to?

01:30.624 --> 01:32.124
Saint Teresa's.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.126
Found this...

01:34.128 --> 01:35.628
on the path.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.129
coming through!
Coming through,
PARAMEDIC:

01:43.270 --> 01:45.437
CERRETA:
Has she been conscious?
Has she said anything?

01:45.439 --> 01:46.538
She's in a coma,
Detective;

01:46.540 --> 01:48.307
that tends
to prevent speech.

01:48.309 --> 01:51.176
Go to the park,
get your head crushed?

01:51.178 --> 01:52.578
Makes you want to move
someplace safe.

01:52.580 --> 01:53.679
Didn't know
there were any left.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.581
Is she gonna
get out of this?

01:55.583 --> 01:58.317
Cerebral hemorrhage,
skull fractures,

01:58.319 --> 02:00.252
damage to the vocal chords--

02:00.254 --> 02:03.322
add the exposure,
it's a miracle she's alive.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.556
She survives this,

02:04.558 --> 02:07.259
she's in for
a long recovery.

02:10.698 --> 02:13.599
You the cops who
sent us the Jane Doe?

02:13.601 --> 02:15.134
Yup.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.705
Lucy Neven.
568 Central Park West.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.206
You're kidding.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.574
No, I made it up.
Why?

02:22.576 --> 02:24.209
Major soap star.

02:24.211 --> 02:26.378
Delia Mason
on<i> World Without End.</i>

02:26.380 --> 02:28.030
My mother watches it.

02:28.031 --> 02:29.681
She follows the stories
like it happened
to the neighbors.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.183
Tell your mom,

02:31.185 --> 02:32.751
she's in for
a plot twist.

04:00.507 --> 04:01.640
You believe this?

04:01.642 --> 04:03.675
They already
got her buried.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.943
She's not in
great shape.

04:04.945 --> 04:08.280
We don't crack this quick,
we won't be either.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.782
Whatever's on your plate,
clean it.

04:10.784 --> 04:11.850
This comes first.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.585
Well, it ain't
a mugging,

04:13.587 --> 04:15.754
'cause she still had
cash with her.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.557
Could have been interrupted--
caught in the act.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.125
She's recognizable.

04:20.126 --> 04:21.692
This woman is on a
soap opera every day.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.462
LOGAN:
John Lennon theory.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.763
It's not possible
heard of her?e never

04:24.765 --> 04:26.498
The fact
of the matter is,

04:26.500 --> 04:27.599
these people get accosted
in the supermarket,

04:27.601 --> 04:28.700
for crying out loud.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.702
Phil, nobody's saying no. Okay?

04:30.704 --> 04:31.937
It's a possibility.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.639
Now, what about the girl?

04:33.641 --> 04:34.906
Is she in any shape
to talk to us?

04:34.908 --> 04:36.808
Barely breathing.

04:36.810 --> 04:40.512
Get what you can
without her then, okay?

04:40.514 --> 04:42.548
I'm on double shifts.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.583
These days, you got to take
all the work you can get.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.285
Do you have people hanging
around for her?

04:46.287 --> 04:47.819
Fans? Autograph hounds?

04:47.821 --> 04:49.588
Five, six a year.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.623
Miss Neven-- she keeps
her address a secret.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.758
MAN:
Thank you.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.527
She was almost killed
on the show.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.529
Do you believe in destiny,
karma,

04:57.531 --> 04:58.797
that kind of thing?

04:58.799 --> 05:00.666
She was mugged
not on TV.k,

05:00.668 --> 05:02.701
Does she walk her dog
on a schedule?

05:02.703 --> 05:05.737
10:00, every night. I give Roxy
a biscuit as they go out.

05:05.739 --> 05:06.872
Does Miss Neven have
a busy social life?

05:06.874 --> 05:08.774
A good-looking lady
like that?

05:08.776 --> 05:11.076
My aunt gets more action;
she's 60.

05:13.347 --> 05:16.682
They had to write her
out of the show.

05:16.684 --> 05:20.585
My mother thinks
Lucy is so glamorous.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.721
I've got it easy being her
secretary.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.324
She has to work
12 hours a day.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.958
She have time
to make enemies?

05:26.960 --> 05:29.361
She's up at 5:30;
she's at the studio by 7:00.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.595
She gets home,

05:30.597 --> 05:32.731
she's too tired
to brush her teeth.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.066
That's hardly time for friends,

05:34.068 --> 05:35.600
let alone enemies.

05:35.602 --> 05:36.935
Could you tell us
if anything

05:36.937 --> 05:39.905
she'd have with her
is missing?

05:46.580 --> 05:49.681
A ring, her...
grandmother's wedding band,

05:49.683 --> 05:53.618
and a medal--
her father gave it to her.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.053
St. Genesius.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.121
St. Genesius. That's..?

05:56.123 --> 05:58.924
WOMAN:
The patron saint
of actors.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.625
But why take that?

06:00.627 --> 06:02.794
They didn't take the money;
that's crazy.

06:02.796 --> 06:06.064
Do you get requests from people
who ask for things like that?

06:06.066 --> 06:07.733
I sort them--

06:08.669 --> 06:12.938
weird, weirder, weirdest.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.407
These are just
the past three months.

06:16.944 --> 06:20.879
"I cannot live with the idea
that you are angry with me."

06:20.881 --> 06:23.148
"I know you would love
my daughter."

06:23.150 --> 06:26.685
"I didn't like it when you
wouldn't talk to us."

06:26.687 --> 06:28.687
A woman
broke Lucy's skull? No.

06:28.689 --> 06:29.955
Pardon me, Dr. Freud.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.591
Women don't get angry
and violent?

06:32.593 --> 06:35.093
I hope her mail
is more interesting than mine.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.696
No contest. These should
be postmarked "Bellevue."

06:37.698 --> 06:40.699
We have three solid cuckoos
in town-- one in Atlanta,

06:40.701 --> 06:42.701
two in St. Louis,
three in L.A.,

06:42.703 --> 06:43.969
and one in Denver.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.537
Had to be local.

06:45.538 --> 06:47.104
Stalked her, knew
when she walked the dog.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.674
Still, I'll check
the out-of-town alibis.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.410
You guys knock on doors.

06:51.412 --> 06:54.713
First we get fettuccini,
then knock on doors.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.881
(<i> knocking</i> )

06:55.883 --> 06:57.149
Hello?

06:57.151 --> 06:58.784
Mr. Wadsworth?

06:58.786 --> 06:59.885
MAN:
<i> Who's asking?</i>

06:59.887 --> 07:00.952
Police.

07:02.689 --> 07:06.691
We're looking for nominations
for Citizen of the Week, sir.

07:06.693 --> 07:09.694
I'm Mr. Wadsworth.

07:09.695 --> 07:12.696
And there's not a person on this
damn block worth nominating.

07:12.699 --> 07:16.668
Yes, and you're not
the first one to say so, sir.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.338
I wrote her letters.

07:19.339 --> 07:22.007
She said in lots of interviews
that she likes to get them.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.675
If you could tell us

07:23.677 --> 07:25.710
where you were
at 10:00 or 11:00?

07:25.712 --> 07:27.679
My girlfriend's apartment,

07:27.681 --> 07:29.681
and then I got home...

07:29.683 --> 07:32.083
um, I don't know... Dad?

07:32.085 --> 07:35.954
Oh, I got home
from the office at 9:00.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.123
Jesse got home...

07:38.125 --> 07:39.691
What, Jesse? 10:00?

07:39.693 --> 07:41.159
Yeah, I think so.

07:41.161 --> 07:44.863
Ah, Olivia, our housekeeper,
she'd remember.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.502
Olivia?

07:57.778 --> 08:00.512
Olivia,
Thursday night--

08:00.514 --> 08:03.682
what time
did Jesse get home?

08:03.684 --> 08:06.051
Around 10:30.

08:06.053 --> 08:10.188
I was watching the news--
channel nine.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.723
Thank you.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.926
The biggest soap convention
of the year.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.194
I wouldn't miss that.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.529
I was there
Thursday morning

08:17.531 --> 08:20.198
to be there before
the good stuff got sold.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.933
That's dedication for you.

08:21.935 --> 08:25.203
That comb-- only $60.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.372
Delia was using it

08:27.373 --> 08:29.540
when she told Joel
she wouldn't marry him.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.209
She's too good for him.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.578
All the people there--

08:33.579 --> 08:35.946
maybe some dealers or somebody
might remember you?

08:35.949 --> 08:37.949
Oh, I don't know.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.818
There were 6,000 people.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.953
Oh, I took the shuttle back.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.522
I threw out the ticket.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.557
I think it's right here.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.080
Was he taller than you?

09:09.082 --> 09:10.782
Or the same height?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.286
LOGAN:
Taller.

09:14.288 --> 09:16.321
You got a good look at him?

09:19.326 --> 09:21.226
ARTIST:
He was dark?

09:21.228 --> 09:23.595
He had a dark complexion?

09:30.804 --> 09:33.338
CERRETA:
Is this the best
you can do?

09:33.340 --> 09:35.206
With a woman
who can't talk?

09:35.208 --> 09:37.943
She's good for 15 minutes
at a stretch.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.578
Thanks anyway.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.212
You got the staff list
of the soap?
Yeah.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.816
Maybe someone was hanging around
that door bothering her.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.084
It's worth a shot.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.321
To me, they all
look the same--

09:49.323 --> 09:53.224
autograph pads, sparkly pens
with big white balls on top.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.626
They line up outside.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.227
They can be difficult.

09:56.229 --> 09:59.297
Maybe Miss Neven made
one of her fans angry?

09:59.299 --> 10:00.932
She was very gracious.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.067
More than me.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.301
The end of a day,
I want to get home.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.170
I got a two-year-old kid.

10:05.171 --> 10:07.038
Did Lucy get close
to anybody on the crew?

10:07.040 --> 10:09.307
I guess Sara<i> was</i> the closest.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.309
CERRETA:
"Was"?

10:11.311 --> 10:12.911
Lucy had her fired.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.913
Something about
stuff missing.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.182
You mean,
she was stealing?

10:17.184 --> 10:18.316
Sara said no.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.651
I like her,

10:19.653 --> 10:22.320
but she didn't file
a union grievance

10:22.322 --> 10:23.922
when she got canned.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.191
Did she have the right
to file one?

10:26.193 --> 10:29.194
Lucy was probably right.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.329
I got her another job--
costume house.

10:31.331 --> 10:35.200
They supply us, other shows.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.369
I'd heard of Lucy
turning on people,

10:37.371 --> 10:39.304
but I thought we got along.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.306
Must have done wonders
for your reputation.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.907
I'm happy to have a job.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.643
CERRETA:
Why didn't you
tell your union?

10:44.645 --> 10:45.910
I did.

10:45.912 --> 10:47.178
I<i> did.</i>

10:47.180 --> 10:49.014
You think we didn't check?

10:49.016 --> 10:50.882
I'll put you on the phone
with your shop steward.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.685
You know what they do
with old costumes?

10:53.687 --> 10:55.353
Actors take them home.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.956
A guy corners me
outside the studio,

10:57.958 --> 11:00.358
hands me 200--
anything of Lucy's.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.160
Who would it hurt?

11:02.162 --> 11:03.912
What the hell's that?

11:03.913 --> 11:05.663
Thou shalt not steal,
except when nobody gets hurt?

11:05.666 --> 11:07.065
I needed the money.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.934
But then he started
wanting slips, bras...

11:09.936 --> 11:12.337
that stuff doesn't belong
to wardrobe.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.205
That's a fine distinction.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.974
Who was your source of income?

11:15.976 --> 11:18.943
Mitchell Burkitt-- down on
the Lower Eastside somewhere.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.979
What'd he do
with Lucy's underwear?

11:20.981 --> 11:24.382
I really didn't want to know.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.451
Burkitt, Michael W.--

11:26.453 --> 11:29.354
criminal trespass two,
burglary three.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.388
What does he like?

11:30.390 --> 11:32.924
Soap opera studios,
movie locations.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.427
Also assaulted a guard
who tried to stop him.

11:35.429 --> 11:37.195
His supplier gets canned,

11:37.197 --> 11:38.930
no more underwear
to sell.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.199
A ring and a medal--
bigger bucks.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.434
Draw some arrest papers.

11:42.436 --> 11:44.202
Phil, we're not
even pregnant yet.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.336
Assault record?

11:45.338 --> 11:47.338
I want to be prepared.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.075
(<i> loud music playing</i> )

11:50.077 --> 11:52.410
(<i> whispering:</i> )
The stereo's on.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.079
He's at home.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.988
MAN:
<i> Who is it?</i>

12:03.990 --> 12:07.125
Con Ed-- checking
for a gas leak!

12:09.196 --> 12:10.228
Drop it!

12:10.230 --> 12:12.197
Don't even think
about it, Mitch!

12:12.199 --> 12:14.165
Now!

12:14.167 --> 12:17.302
You are under arrest
for the attempted murder

12:17.304 --> 12:18.303
of Lucy Neven.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.305
Why didn't you say
you were cops?

12:20.307 --> 12:22.307
You have the right
to remain silent...

12:22.309 --> 12:24.342
You didn't say
you were cops!

12:26.847 --> 12:28.397
In my neighborhood, man,

12:28.398 --> 12:29.948
<i> you</i> wouldn't answer
my door without a gun.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.050
Next time, get one
that's licensed.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.952
I didn't do the lady.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.954
What, do you think
I'm crazy?

12:35.956 --> 12:38.823
Actually, you're about
the sanest person

12:38.825 --> 12:39.991
we've met all week.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.293
Why would I do her, huh?

12:42.295 --> 12:43.862
She's a cash cow.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.997
I survive on her stuff.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.000
Not since
you lost your source.

12:49.002 --> 12:54.539
So, Mr. Burkitt,
where were you Thursday night?

12:54.541 --> 12:56.875
I was alone.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.409
Prove I wasn't.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.411
Prove you were!

13:00.413 --> 13:03.948
Your Lucy stuff--
who buys it?

13:03.950 --> 13:05.917
Kleinman, down on 15th Street.

13:05.919 --> 13:06.951
I want a lawyer.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.419
You'll get a lawyer.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.321
I'll even pay
for the call.

13:10.323 --> 13:13.992
Don't ever say cops
aren't generous.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.327
You want stills
from<i> South Pacific?</i>

13:16.329 --> 13:18.029
Mitzi Gaynor's shoes? Fine.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.165
LOGAN:
Not Lucy Neven's
underwear?

13:20.167 --> 13:21.966
Do I look like a pervert?

13:21.968 --> 13:24.536
Who buys Lucy's clothes?

13:24.538 --> 13:26.571
Customer's names-- it's private.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.106
Did you give Burkitt
an order

13:28.108 --> 13:29.908
to steal Lucy's jewelry?

13:29.910 --> 13:30.992
I sell memorabilia.

13:30.993 --> 13:32.075
You think this is
a hot car business?

13:32.078 --> 13:34.179
Give me an order,
I get it stolen?

13:34.181 --> 13:36.848
Suppose we get a warrant,
Mr. Kleinman,

13:36.850 --> 13:38.917
and we do
an inventory?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.451
Think we'll find
stolen goods?

13:40.453 --> 13:42.453
From a soap opera
studio maybe?

13:42.455 --> 13:43.988
I'd never accept...

13:43.990 --> 13:46.925
You want us to start checking?

13:46.927 --> 13:49.861
You're starting to make me
a little impatient.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.863
Voorman.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.865
Tim Voorman.

13:53.867 --> 13:56.000
He works at the Club Vivant.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.102
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,
Tim Voorman.

13:58.104 --> 13:59.604
CERRETA:
Mr. Voorman?

13:59.606 --> 14:01.840
Sergeant Cerreta,
Detective Logan.

14:01.842 --> 14:05.143
Very impressive.

14:05.144 --> 14:08.445
Louie Kleinman says you ordered
Lucy Neven's intimate apparel.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.916
You think I was involved with...

14:11.918 --> 14:14.953
Yeah, well, I also ordered
Joan Collins's costumes.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.088
They help me get into character.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.556
And they fit you?

14:18.558 --> 14:21.209
Well, I'm very petite.

14:21.210 --> 14:23.861
Mr. Voorman, Thursday night,
did you take a walk in the park?

14:23.864 --> 14:25.430
I don't believe this.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.431
I was here.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.533
Two shows-- 8:00 and 10:00.

14:32.873 --> 14:35.640
You happen to leave
between shows?

14:35.642 --> 14:38.109
Do you have any idea
how long it takes

14:38.111 --> 14:39.510
to put on this face?

14:39.512 --> 14:41.646
And contrary
to what<i> you</i> might think,

14:41.648 --> 14:44.182
I don't go out in public
in drag.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.650
I do this for a living.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.118
CERRETA:
This isn't
your stage act,

14:47.120 --> 14:48.519
so you can pack in
the attitude.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.588
Do you  have any witnesses
who saw you here?

14:50.590 --> 14:54.125
What's the mystery?

14:54.127 --> 14:55.660
I got a guy from Jersey

14:55.662 --> 14:58.663
who sees my Lucy act
six nights a week.

14:58.665 --> 15:01.065
One guy,
he wants to talk with Lucy

15:01.067 --> 15:03.101
about the plot on the show.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.570
Another one,
a<i> real</i> weirdo,

15:05.572 --> 15:06.671
buys my Lucy dress.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.072
Who attacked her?

15:08.074 --> 15:09.073
One of them.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.575
Who bought the dress?

15:10.577 --> 15:12.510
Out of his mind.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.678
He loved Lucy.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.280
He wanted to<i> be</i> with her.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.681
Offers 250.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.283
I thought he was kidding.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.684
500-- I said no.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.019
1,000...

15:21.021 --> 15:23.488
I didn't want to sell it, but...

15:23.490 --> 15:25.089
he scared me a little.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.557
You got the name?

15:26.559 --> 15:29.494
He didn't ask for a receipt.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.663
Mr. Webster? Hi.

15:31.665 --> 15:34.532
This is Joe Harris
from the Club Vivant.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.034
Mr. Nichols?

15:36.036 --> 15:37.702
Sam Jones, the Club Vivant.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.204
Mr. Voorman...
he'd like to buy back

15:40.206 --> 15:41.706
that dress he sold you.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.175
The dress you bought
from Tim Voorman...

15:44.177 --> 15:45.944
Okay. Sorry.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.278
Thank you.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.613
Sorry to bother you.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.615
We thought
the letters were bad.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.016
They're worse

15:52.018 --> 15:53.151
in person.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.053
Hello? Jesse Unger, please.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.722
Could you give me
his work number then?

15:57.724 --> 15:59.223
Thank you.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.658
Mr. Markson? Hi.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.728
This is Sam Jones
from the Club Vivant.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.697
Mr. Unger? Yeah, I'll wait.

16:05.699 --> 16:08.733
That Lucy Neven dress
you bought from Tim Voorman?

16:08.735 --> 16:11.569
Well, he would like...

16:11.571 --> 16:12.737
Sorry to bother you.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.172
Mr. Unger?

16:14.174 --> 16:16.708
Yeah, this is Joe Harris,
Club Vivant.

16:16.710 --> 16:19.610
You know, Mr. Voorman
would like to buy back

16:19.612 --> 16:21.012
his Lucy Neven dress.

16:21.014 --> 16:22.146
Uh-huh.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.247
Oh. Yeah.

16:23.249 --> 16:24.615
Well, certainly.

16:24.617 --> 16:25.717
Well, thank you.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.722
Mr. Unger
wants to keep his dress.

16:30.724 --> 16:33.624
Really?

16:33.626 --> 16:34.592
I can't stop.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.728
This has to be done by tonight.

16:36.730 --> 16:38.663
LOGAN:
Did you buy the dress?

16:38.665 --> 16:40.631
Yes, I did--
for my collection.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.735
I needed something special.

16:43.737 --> 16:46.037
Terrible, Lucy dying, hmm?

16:46.039 --> 16:47.705
Oh, Lucy didn't die, Jesse.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.007
No. On the show.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.775
They had to get rid of her.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.610
Thursday night,
at your girlfriend's--

16:52.612 --> 16:54.645
what time did you leave?

16:54.647 --> 16:56.647
I already told you.

16:56.649 --> 16:57.749
About 10:00.

16:57.751 --> 17:01.686
Is your girlfriend Sandy
at home today?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.287
No, she's not.

17:03.289 --> 17:04.689
She's working.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.657
You've got the wrong idea.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.260
Jesse is Lucy's scrapbook.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.695
It's a hobby.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.664
LOGAN:
Does that include
buying her dress?

17:13.666 --> 17:15.666
You don't understand.

17:15.668 --> 17:18.403
Well, you'll think I'm crazy.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.671
We went to
a Tina Turner concert--

17:20.673 --> 17:22.140
Jess and me--

17:22.142 --> 17:23.574
I wanted her autograph.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.676
We waited in the cold two hours.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.812
But an autograph
is not a dress.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.081
Lucy, to me she's boring.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.349
So what?

17:31.351 --> 17:33.651
Jesse doesn't like Tina Turner.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.621
I mean, didn't you
ever collect anybody?

17:36.623 --> 17:39.257
My wife has a lot
of Rosemary Clooney records.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.258
Who?

17:40.260 --> 17:41.659
LOGAN:
Miss Reynolds,

17:41.661 --> 17:43.694
Mr. Unger left
at 10:00 p.m.?

17:43.696 --> 17:46.264
What you're thinking
about Jesse, it couldn't be.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.433
Look, are you sure
about the time?

17:48.435 --> 17:50.735
It might have been earlier.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.437
Maybe a quarter of.

17:52.439 --> 17:55.640
Um, we had an argument.

17:55.642 --> 17:58.443
He wanted me
to try the dress on.

17:58.445 --> 18:01.179
I didn't think it was right.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.281
Quarter to 10:00? 10:00?
Come on.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.249
15 minutes makes
a difference?

18:05.251 --> 18:08.419
15 minutes gives
him more time
to get to Lucy's.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.288
Sandy's on 97th Street.

18:10.290 --> 18:14.292
Jesse's home, 57th Street,
30 to 45 minutes later.

18:14.294 --> 18:17.161
And Lucy lives in between
at 65th Street.

18:17.163 --> 18:20.698
It's enough time, barely, if he
knew when Lucy walked the dog.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.201
He stopped at Lucy's
on his way home to what?

18:23.203 --> 18:24.702
Talk to her?

18:24.704 --> 18:25.770
Hey, you're the one
who talked to him.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.371
He look goofy to you?

18:27.373 --> 18:30.108
Seemed fine,
but who can tell anymore?

18:30.110 --> 18:31.876
31 years old,
he still lives at Daddy's.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.277
Also, he sprang

18:33.279 --> 18:35.646
for 1,000 bucks
to buy Lucy's dress.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.349
What about his arrival time
at home?

18:38.351 --> 18:40.284
How solid is that alibi?

18:42.422 --> 18:45.823
<i> I have friends</i>
<i> in the fashion world.</i>

18:45.825 --> 18:48.493
Is something wrong with that?

18:48.495 --> 18:50.428
You got your son his job.

18:50.430 --> 18:53.498
I arranged an interview,
they offered him the job.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.899
The woman's dress.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.467
That's $1,000.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.904
Your son can afford that
on the job he has?

18:59.906 --> 19:01.439
Jesse's interests--

19:01.441 --> 19:04.909
he doesn't have to be
like everybody else.

19:04.911 --> 19:08.479
Following an actress's career--
it's harmless.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.281
Up to a point.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.749
Mr. Unger,

19:11.751 --> 19:13.217
when Jesse arrived home,

19:13.219 --> 19:14.919
your housekeeper said
it was 10:30.

19:14.921 --> 19:15.920
You said 10:00.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.456
My son has problems.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.526
Violence is not one of them.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.527
Sandy was upset.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.928
The dress--

19:23.930 --> 19:27.298
I wanted to see, if she
has such a good figure,

19:27.300 --> 19:28.699
how she'd look in it.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.701
CERRETA:
We can clear this up.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.537
You left Sandy's
apartment at 10:00?

19:32.539 --> 19:33.504
Mm-hmm.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.805
How'd you get home?

19:34.807 --> 19:35.940
I walked.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.543
40 blocks
in a half an hour?

19:38.545 --> 19:40.444
You must be a marathon walker.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.813
Maybe I took a cab.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.282
Well, you know
what we ought to do?

19:44.284 --> 19:45.950
We ought to go down
to the precinct.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.518
We'll talk
the whole thing over.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.489
We'll call the cab company,
get the whole thing settled.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.425
Um...

19:54.427 --> 19:55.526
Okay, fine.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.527
Sure.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.428
Good.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.964
Look, I'm sorry about Lucy.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.432
But hurting her?

20:01.434 --> 20:03.434
No. I loved watching her.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.836
I have a little television
at work.

20:05.838 --> 20:09.574
We want to remind you that
you're entitled to a lawyer.

20:09.576 --> 20:10.975
Sandy will tell you.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.978
Olivia, she said
that I came home at 10:30.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.813
I would never hurt Lucy.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.548
Will you excuse me?

20:23.523 --> 20:26.490
He's in tooth fairy land
and he's scared.

20:26.492 --> 20:29.527
The hospital says Lucy
has some paralysis.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.395
She still has
blurred vision,

20:31.397 --> 20:33.397
but they will
bring her over.

20:33.399 --> 20:36.234
Do you think
you can get this guy

20:36.236 --> 20:37.902
to volunteer
for a lineup?

20:37.904 --> 20:39.470
I don't know.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.871
What if he won't?

20:40.873 --> 20:42.473
Heck if I know.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.541
Okay.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.581
Jesse, would you like to be
in a lineup?

20:50.583 --> 20:53.985
If nobody identifies you,
you go back to work.

20:53.987 --> 20:55.353
A lineup?

20:55.355 --> 20:56.520
For who?

20:56.522 --> 20:57.888
Lucy Neven.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.379
Take your time.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.047
There's no hurry.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.592
(<i> Neven gasping</i> )

21:34.594 --> 21:36.360
Oh, my God!

21:36.362 --> 21:38.929
That's... that's him.

21:38.931 --> 21:43.367
He stopped me on the street
a couple of times.

21:43.369 --> 21:44.535
Which one is he?

21:44.537 --> 21:45.536
Hmm?

21:45.538 --> 21:50.074
It's number four.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.576
He said that he
needed me.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.447
Let's get the video camera.

21:56.449 --> 21:59.317
One more shot at him
and he's going to talk.

21:59.319 --> 22:00.551
Yeah.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.988
Your dad will be here soon.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.390
You don't have to talk now.

22:06.392 --> 22:07.625
Was Lucy here?

22:07.627 --> 22:10.695
She says she saw you that night.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.635
(<i> knocking</i> )

22:25.445 --> 22:28.512
Had these on him
when he was booked.

22:41.427 --> 22:43.427
Lucy's ring, Jesse.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.469
Her medal.

22:55.608 --> 22:58.376
Where did you
get these?

23:00.446 --> 23:02.913
She wouldn't listen.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.549
I just wanted to talk.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.987
She told me
to leave her alone.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.723
I didn't want to hurt her.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.692
God, her eyes!

23:16.496 --> 23:19.930
If you saw her eyes.

23:19.932 --> 23:23.467
She walked right by me.

23:23.469 --> 23:26.437
She didn't say anything.

23:26.439 --> 23:30.508
I tried to tell her
how I need her.

23:30.510 --> 23:33.577
I didn't want to hurt her.

23:36.649 --> 23:40.684
She just got tangled up
in her dog leash,

23:40.686 --> 23:43.120
and I went to help her,

23:43.122 --> 23:45.723
and she started hitting at me,

23:45.725 --> 23:48.426
and the dog was barking,

23:48.428 --> 23:52.997
and I just wanted to talk
to her.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.465
That's all.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.467
I just wanted to talk to her.

23:58.438 --> 24:01.539
OLIVET:
How long have you been aware
of Lucy Neven?

24:01.541 --> 24:03.974
JESSE:
Ever since I can remember.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.075
Come on, Ben.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.977
You saw that tape.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.513
This guy's got toys
in the attic.

24:09.515 --> 24:13.083
Is he competent enough
to help you with his case?

24:13.085 --> 24:15.886
I guarantee you,
he didn't know
what he was doing.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.988
That's not the issue here.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.957
Can he help you
defend him?

24:19.959 --> 24:22.059
Maybe,
but he's still bonkers.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.161
He didn't know
what he was doing
when he attacked her.

24:24.163 --> 24:27.465
You don't know that,
and neither do I.

24:27.467 --> 24:30.067
Let's first see
if he can stand trial.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.069
I've seen trials on TV.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.804
Lucy was in one.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.940
OLIVET:
What happens at a trial?

24:35.942 --> 24:37.875
Why are you asking me that?

24:37.877 --> 24:40.244
We both know they decide
if you're guilty.

24:40.246 --> 24:42.513
What does your lawyer do?

24:42.515 --> 24:45.816
He tries to defend me from...

24:45.818 --> 24:48.953
He keeps me from going to jail.

24:48.955 --> 24:51.789
Why would you go to jail, Jesse?

24:51.791 --> 24:54.124
Sorry, Dr. Olivet.
Off-limits.

24:54.126 --> 24:56.527
I'm not asking about the crime,
Dr. Mandel.

24:56.529 --> 24:59.897
I'm asking if he understands
why people go to jail.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.232
Because they break the law.

25:01.234 --> 25:03.601
Hurting somebody,
is that breaking the law?

25:03.603 --> 25:06.270
These are stupid questions.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.272
Jesse, please...

25:08.274 --> 25:11.275
Is it wrong to hurt somebody?

25:11.277 --> 25:14.044
I just wanted to talk to her.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.247
That's all.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.818
STONE:
<i> what is the argument?</i>

25:20.820 --> 25:23.187
Mr. Unger understands
the legal process.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.022
He babbled
a confession.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.924
That doesn't
give you a problem?

25:26.926 --> 25:28.125
He was frightened;
that does not mean

25:28.127 --> 25:30.027
he's not competent
to stand trial.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.229
He does not understand
the criminal justice system.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.931
He knows what a trial is.

25:33.933 --> 25:35.132
Hey, hey, this isn't
a free-for-all.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.902
I ask the questions.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.603
You honestly contend,

25:39.605 --> 25:42.039
he can't give you
pertinent facts?

25:42.041 --> 25:45.042
Judge, he is suffering
a neurotic denial,

25:45.044 --> 25:47.311
and it's hard
to get any information

25:47.313 --> 25:49.179
out of him at all.

25:49.181 --> 25:52.082
I'll read
the doctors' reports again.

25:52.084 --> 25:54.952
Meantime,
Mr. Unger stays at Rikers.

25:54.954 --> 25:58.589
MAN:
Come on, Lucy,
you can do it.

25:58.591 --> 26:00.324
Right to the end.

26:00.326 --> 26:03.060
Keep walking.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.596
It's a piece of cake.

26:08.568 --> 26:11.635
STONE:
They say if we go to trial,

26:11.637 --> 26:13.938
that you'll be able
to testify.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.306
It's your choice.

26:15.308 --> 26:17.641
Don't force yourself, honey.

26:17.643 --> 26:24.949
(<i> raspy-voiced:</i> )
I'll testify if I have to crawl
into the courtroom.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.951
He came after me before.

26:26.953 --> 26:29.353
He called the house
several times.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.689
Somehow, he got the number.

26:31.691 --> 26:33.958
If he doesn't go to jail...

26:33.960 --> 26:36.026
(<i> violent coughing</i> )

26:51.677 --> 26:53.143
Lucy...

26:53.145 --> 26:57.681
I'll do everything I can
to make sure that never happens.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.353
Schreiber says
we can indict him.

27:02.355 --> 27:05.055
He's competent
to stand trial.

27:07.893 --> 27:09.994
Does that serve justice?

27:09.996 --> 27:12.162
Jesse Unger on trial?
In prison?

27:12.164 --> 27:14.898
If he's responsible
for his actions,

27:14.900 --> 27:17.067
yes, I think
justice is served.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.969
Mr. Stone, my son,

27:18.971 --> 27:21.705
after he lost
his mother...

27:21.707 --> 27:23.340
you can't imagine.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.342
I tried to help him.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.911
Why didn't you seek
professional help?

27:27.913 --> 27:30.114
He's not like
other people.

27:30.116 --> 27:32.416
He never
seemed dangerous.

27:32.418 --> 27:35.686
Jack, it's your meeting.

27:35.688 --> 27:36.987
Reconsider going to trial, Ben.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.922
Work out some kind of treatment
for him.

27:38.924 --> 27:41.659
If they can protect Lucy Neven
from him...

27:41.661 --> 27:43.127
You know that they can't.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.428
A jury can.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.430
All I've got to do

27:46.432 --> 27:50.167
is prove he was insane
at the moment he attacked her.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.770
Not a second before,
not a second after.

27:52.772 --> 27:56.206
I've tried a lot of these cases,
Ben; you haven't.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.976
I'm a quick study.

27:58.978 --> 28:00.978
Why is Gaffney so confident?

28:00.980 --> 28:03.313
Insanity defenses
are not easy to win.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.049
Olivet will testify
he's not delusional.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.984
What more can we do?

28:06.986 --> 28:08.986
"Delusional"-- fancy word.

28:08.988 --> 28:12.122
You might as well say
"subordinated debenture."

28:12.124 --> 28:15.025
A jury knows crazy
and not crazy, Paul.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.394
They don't know<i> legally</i> crazy.

28:17.396 --> 28:20.030
You know
what really worries me--

28:20.032 --> 28:22.332
I make my best case
to prove he's sane.

28:22.334 --> 28:23.801
We lose.

28:23.803 --> 28:26.070
He goes to a hospital.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.005
I have to turn 180°

28:28.007 --> 28:31.008
and argue he is not sane
so they keep him there.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.409
It's no-win.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.378
Maybe we make a deal-- assault.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.247
for a couple of years--
Bad risk-- he goes away

28:37.249 --> 28:40.984
as soon as he gets out,
he could kill that woman.

28:40.986 --> 28:43.053
(<i> phone buzzing</i> )

28:47.493 --> 28:49.760
Mm-hmm.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.097
Lucy Neven.

28:53.099 --> 28:55.099
Better talk to her.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.234
How could they
let him mail it?

28:57.236 --> 28:59.403
Why didn't
somebody stop him?

28:59.405 --> 29:01.338
"I never wanted to hurt you.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.140
"I had to bring you close.

29:03.142 --> 29:05.008
"We're the same person.

29:05.010 --> 29:07.044
We'll always be close."

29:07.046 --> 29:09.747
I'm sorry.
This shouldn't have happened.

29:09.749 --> 29:11.281
They put a watch

29:11.283 --> 29:13.117
on his mail today.

29:13.119 --> 29:15.753
He said we're the same person.

29:15.755 --> 29:18.122
He sounds crazier than ever.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.823
He's shrewder than ever.

29:19.825 --> 29:21.325
He wants to sound crazy.

29:21.327 --> 29:24.394
Do we have to turn this over
to Gaffney?

29:24.396 --> 29:28.265
STONE:
We don't turn it over,
he'll get a subpoena.

29:28.267 --> 29:31.034
Jesse will tell him
he sent the letter.

29:31.036 --> 29:34.037
They're going to use it
to show how crazy he is.

29:34.039 --> 29:35.839
That's what he wants.

29:37.409 --> 29:39.543
<i> And after reading a report</i>

29:39.545 --> 29:41.278
of his personal history?

29:41.280 --> 29:43.080
I examined Mr. Unger.

29:43.082 --> 29:45.482
Did you reach any conclusions
about his mental condition?

29:45.484 --> 29:47.451
Yes, I have.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.788
Mr. Unger has personality
and character disorders.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.790
He's obsessive-compulsive,

29:52.792 --> 29:54.892
with signs
of extreme depression.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.561
Does this mean
he is incapable
of understanding

29:57.563 --> 30:00.063
the consequences of his actions?

30:00.065 --> 30:04.468
No. It means he's unhappy,
and in some ways dysfunctional.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.520
In your expert opinion,

30:06.521 --> 30:08.571
does Mr. Unger suffer from
any condition that would impair

30:08.574 --> 30:11.175
his ability
to know right from wrong?

30:11.177 --> 30:12.876
Despite his emotional problems,

30:12.878 --> 30:15.479
in my opinion, Mr. Unger
has a complete understanding

30:15.481 --> 30:18.348
of the consequences
of his actions.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.918
Thank you. No further questions.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.586
Dr. Olivet,

30:22.588 --> 30:27.457
you spent three hours
talking to Mr. Unger.

30:27.459 --> 30:30.394
Do you think
that's sufficient time

30:30.396 --> 30:33.463
to make a judgment
on his mental health?

30:33.465 --> 30:34.464
Yes, I do.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.533
Admirable.

30:36.535 --> 30:40.871
So, you are telling this court
with absolute assurance

30:40.873 --> 30:44.208
that Mr. Unger
did not have an episode

30:44.210 --> 30:46.210
in which he did not know

30:46.212 --> 30:48.512
the consequences
of his behavior.

30:48.514 --> 30:52.349
In my opinion, Mr. Unger
knows right from wrong.

30:52.351 --> 30:55.352
He told me
he'd been watching me

30:55.354 --> 30:58.222
because he knew I would...

30:58.224 --> 31:02.226
I would love him
if only I met him.

31:02.228 --> 31:06.330
He was very excited,

31:06.332 --> 31:10.367
so I tried
to keep him calm,

31:10.369 --> 31:13.503
and then I tried to get away.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.873
He told me to stop,

31:15.875 --> 31:17.875
and when I didn't,

31:17.877 --> 31:19.943
he attacked me.

31:22.147 --> 31:24.648
Miss Neven,
prior to this attack,

31:24.650 --> 31:28.151
had you ever seen
the defendant before?

31:28.153 --> 31:31.989
He accosted me on the street
several times.

31:31.991 --> 31:35.659
I don't remember
how many.

31:35.661 --> 31:39.963
He told me that he had
called me on the phone.

31:39.965 --> 31:42.165
What is your profession?

31:42.167 --> 31:45.903
I... I was an actress.

31:45.905 --> 31:47.671
You<i> were</i> an actress?

31:47.673 --> 31:51.608
You don't expect to be able
to continue your career?

31:51.610 --> 31:53.210
Objection-- relevance.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.678
The extent
of her injuries

31:54.680 --> 31:57.514
is relevant to
the attempted murder charge.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.549
Overruled.

31:59.551 --> 32:02.419
The witness will answer.

32:02.421 --> 32:06.023
I'll be happy
if I'm able to walk.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.361
Thank you. No further questions.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.498
Mr. Gaffney?

32:22.942 --> 32:26.009
I have no questions
of this witness.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.447
Olivet was convincing.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.482
Convincing isn't the point.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.217
Did they understand?

32:34.219 --> 32:36.353
Crazy versus legally crazy.

32:44.997 --> 32:46.997
Voices, delusions...

32:46.999 --> 32:48.699
Convenient.

32:48.701 --> 32:52.436
The one illness that wins
insanity defense.

32:52.438 --> 32:54.671
You read Mandel's transcript.

32:54.673 --> 32:57.274
Did Jesse talk
about voices then?

32:57.276 --> 32:59.576
Mandel interviewed him
again.

32:59.578 --> 33:01.311
Yeah, I wonder why.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.613
Gaffney--
would he coach his client?

33:03.615 --> 33:05.382
It's hard to believe.

33:05.384 --> 33:06.750
It's not his style.

33:06.752 --> 33:10.053
I'll tell you one voice
Jesse Unger is hearing--

33:10.055 --> 33:13.223
the voice telling him
how not to get convicted.

33:14.059 --> 33:15.625
Listen to this:

33:15.627 --> 33:18.662
"Mandel: Why didn't you tell me
you heard voices?

33:18.664 --> 33:21.131
"Jesse: The voice said not to.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.599
My father said I should."

33:22.601 --> 33:25.168
"My father said I should."

33:25.170 --> 33:28.138
Your interviews-- no voices?

33:29.174 --> 33:30.374
Is he delusional?

33:30.376 --> 33:32.709
Am I 100% sure?

33:32.711 --> 33:34.177
99.

33:34.179 --> 33:35.779
I'd prefer 100.

33:35.781 --> 33:37.965
Never happens.

33:37.966 --> 33:40.150
Somebody told dad
what would get Jesse off.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.119
Dad told Jesse.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.688
Voices are
a very specific symptom.

33:44.690 --> 33:45.689
Mandel.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.124
Intentionally?

33:47.126 --> 33:49.126
I doubt it. What about Gaffney?

33:49.128 --> 33:53.096
Paul read the transcripts
of his other cases.

33:53.098 --> 33:55.032
But not all of them.

33:55.034 --> 33:57.401
Well, dig up the ones
you haven't read,

33:57.403 --> 34:01.171
and find out how crazy
his other clients really were.

34:01.173 --> 34:05.175
<i> After Jesse's mother died,</i>

34:05.177 --> 34:08.045
he couldn't concentrate.

34:08.047 --> 34:10.747
He used to say
he was going crazy.

34:10.749 --> 34:15.452
What was he
most concerned about?

34:15.454 --> 34:18.321
He thought the world
was going to blow up.

34:18.323 --> 34:21.124
What were some
of his other problems?

34:23.062 --> 34:27.197
He said he heard voices
in his head.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.199
Like a radio.

34:29.201 --> 34:31.334
Thank you.

34:36.308 --> 34:38.375
Mr. Unger,

34:38.377 --> 34:40.677
when exactly

34:40.679 --> 34:43.346
did Jesse tell you
he heard voices?

34:43.348 --> 34:46.817
I think maybe
in his sophomore year

34:46.819 --> 34:48.385
in high school.

34:48.387 --> 34:51.121
It could have been earlier,
maybe later.

34:51.123 --> 34:52.756
I can't remember.

34:52.758 --> 34:56.426
What did he say
these voices told him?

34:58.831 --> 35:01.098
I can't remember.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.867
You remember he heard voices.

35:03.869 --> 35:06.169
I do. Yes, I do.

35:06.171 --> 35:08.138
Did you seek

35:08.140 --> 35:09.873
psychiatric care for your son

35:09.875 --> 35:11.208
at this time?

35:14.146 --> 35:15.846
No.

35:15.848 --> 35:17.414
Why not?

35:17.416 --> 35:19.850
Well...

35:19.852 --> 35:22.886
I'm not sure why I didn't.

35:22.888 --> 35:25.856
That's odd.

35:25.858 --> 35:28.158
Thank you.

35:28.160 --> 35:32.129
Mr. Unger suffers from
processive disintegration.

35:32.131 --> 35:35.899
One of the symptoms
is "command" hallucinations--

35:35.901 --> 35:38.401
voices telling him
to do things.

35:38.403 --> 35:41.138
Now, Dr. Mandel,

35:41.140 --> 35:46.143
Jesse Unger told you
that he heard voices

35:46.145 --> 35:50.147
telling him to kill
Lucy Neven.

35:50.149 --> 35:51.381
Would that mean

35:51.383 --> 35:53.850
he was out of control
of his actions?

35:53.852 --> 35:55.886
In my opinion, yes.

35:55.888 --> 35:58.288
Mr. Unger is often guided

35:58.290 --> 36:00.490
by an overpowering voice

36:00.492 --> 36:02.259
he believes to be real.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.927
Thank you, Doctor.

36:07.399 --> 36:10.767
"Processive disintegration."

36:13.305 --> 36:17.174
Is that a recognized
medical diagnosis?

36:17.176 --> 36:21.344
It's my language
for a combination of disorders.

36:21.346 --> 36:24.447
So it does not exist
in standard reference works?

36:24.449 --> 36:25.882
Yes, that's right.

36:25.884 --> 36:29.819
Now, you testified
you interviewed Jesse twice.

36:29.821 --> 36:32.556
Did he mention hearing voices
in the first interview?

36:32.558 --> 36:34.424
No, he was afraid to.

36:34.426 --> 36:37.928
So he never mentioned voices
until you brought it up?

36:37.930 --> 36:38.929
Yes.

36:38.931 --> 36:39.763
Thank you.

36:39.765 --> 36:40.497
But...

36:40.499 --> 36:43.233
Thank you, Doctor.

36:43.235 --> 36:45.335
They're playing
with the system.

36:45.337 --> 36:46.870
Lying? All of them?

36:46.872 --> 36:50.473
You think the shrink
coached them?

36:50.475 --> 36:53.376
Maybe.

36:53.378 --> 36:54.945
Gaffney.

36:54.947 --> 36:57.280
You don't think a lawyer
would do it.

36:57.282 --> 36:58.515
Olivet doesn't think
a shrink would do it.

36:58.517 --> 36:59.849
We're right back
where we started.

36:59.851 --> 37:01.384
He goes to a hospital.

37:01.386 --> 37:02.886
He says he's cured.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.988
He doesn't hear voices anymore.

37:04.990 --> 37:07.424
He's back on the street,

37:07.425 --> 37:09.859
faster than Lucy Neven
can change her phone number.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.428
(<i> knock at door</i> )

37:11.430 --> 37:13.430
Finished Gaffney's cases

37:13.432 --> 37:16.233
all the way back
to '79.

37:16.235 --> 37:19.970
13 insanity defenses,
seven acquittals.

37:19.972 --> 37:22.539
Three of them,
the defendants
were delusional

37:22.541 --> 37:24.407
<i> after</i>
they started trial.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.942
It's not a clear pattern,

37:25.944 --> 37:28.411
but I grant you,
it's questionable.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.813
STONE:
Call Mr. Unger.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.381
Say if he agrees,

37:31.383 --> 37:34.451
we'd like to meet
with him alone.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.255
That's absurd.

37:38.257 --> 37:41.258
Do you think I would lie
under oath?

37:41.260 --> 37:43.893
As a parent, yes,
I think you would.

37:43.895 --> 37:46.396
You want my son in jail.

37:46.398 --> 37:48.598
You want me in jail too?

37:48.600 --> 37:51.268
Do you have children,
Mr. Stone?

37:51.270 --> 37:53.036
Are they healthy?

37:53.038 --> 37:55.472
Happy?

37:55.474 --> 37:58.642
We all want our children
to be happy.

37:58.644 --> 38:02.879
If not so, at least protected.

38:02.881 --> 38:05.382
My son is sick.

38:05.384 --> 38:08.852
There is no dispute.

38:08.854 --> 38:11.488
Good night.

38:17.896 --> 38:19.462
<i> He had no right</i>

38:19.464 --> 38:21.031
to drag Bill Unger down here.

38:21.033 --> 38:23.366
Mr. Unger was invited.

38:23.368 --> 38:26.303
You wanted him to implicate me
in perjury.

38:26.305 --> 38:27.971
Three cases, your clients

38:27.973 --> 38:30.307
never heard voices
until trial.

38:30.309 --> 38:32.442
Mandel was your shrink
on two of them.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.577
If I wanted to discuss Jesse's
symptoms with his father,

38:34.579 --> 38:35.879
that's my job.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.447
Jack, you're overplaying
your hand.

38:37.449 --> 38:39.349
There's an appearance
of impropriety.

38:39.351 --> 38:43.086
File a complaint with
the disciplinary committee.

38:43.088 --> 38:45.655
The ghost of John Hinckley.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.057
That the problem?

38:47.059 --> 38:48.591
Shoots the President

38:48.593 --> 38:51.661
of the United States
and gets off?

38:51.663 --> 38:54.698
You're desperate,
aren't you?

38:54.700 --> 38:56.733
You want out of this?

38:56.735 --> 38:58.668
I'll plead it.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.470
Assault one.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.406
Gentlemen,

39:03.408 --> 39:05.075
think about it.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.481
I don't know, Adam.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.917
Jesse Unger could walk.

39:13.919 --> 39:16.686
Gaffney's bluffing with assault.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.956
He'll take manslaughter one,
attempt.

39:22.761 --> 39:25.595
I should talk with Lucy Neven.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.998
What does it mean?

39:29.000 --> 39:30.500
How long?

39:30.502 --> 39:34.971
A minimum of five years,
a maximum of 15.

39:36.675 --> 39:38.775
What do you think?

39:38.777 --> 39:40.777
It's your life,

39:40.779 --> 39:45.382
but honestly, I don't know
what that jury will do.

39:45.384 --> 39:52.655
Is there any way
we can make sure it's 15?

39:52.657 --> 39:55.658
The parole board?

39:55.660 --> 39:57.660
We can recommend.

39:57.662 --> 40:00.130
We have no control over them,

40:00.132 --> 40:03.700
and they're just
as unpredictable as juries.

40:03.702 --> 40:06.536
Why me?

40:06.538 --> 40:09.739
I can't give him anything.

40:13.445 --> 40:16.813
I'll take my chances
with the jury

40:16.815 --> 40:19.749
if it's all right with you.

40:21.653 --> 40:24.154
Lucy, the jury...

40:25.724 --> 40:29.426
it may not give you
what you want.

40:29.428 --> 40:34.030
What I want is what I had.

40:38.804 --> 40:42.205
How often do you hear
this voice, Jesse?

40:42.207 --> 40:45.708
She talks to me
when I get confused.

40:45.710 --> 40:47.744
It's a woman's voice?

40:47.746 --> 40:49.479
Mm-hmm.

40:49.481 --> 40:51.815
Does the voice
have a name?

40:51.817 --> 40:55.685
No, she's.... she's just there.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.153
What does she tell you?

40:57.155 --> 40:59.856
I can't talk about that.

40:59.858 --> 41:00.857
(<i> clears throat</i> )

41:00.859 --> 41:03.126
GAFFNEY:
Jesse...

41:03.128 --> 41:08.498
did this voice tell you
to hurt Lucy Neven?

41:10.702 --> 41:14.237
She told me that if Lucy
wouldn't love me,

41:14.239 --> 41:17.774
that I had to kill her.

41:20.645 --> 41:23.646
Is this your handwriting?

41:23.648 --> 41:25.715
Mm-hmm.

41:25.717 --> 41:28.585
Did you write this to Lucy
and send it to her?

41:28.587 --> 41:30.587
Yes, I did.

41:30.589 --> 41:33.156
I'd like you to read
from the top,

41:33.158 --> 41:35.792
out loud to the court.

41:36.895 --> 41:39.662
"Dear Lucy,

41:39.664 --> 41:41.798
"I know you understand
I never meant to hurt you.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.800
I wanted to protect you..."

41:43.802 --> 41:45.702
Louder, son.

41:45.704 --> 41:48.671
So everyone can hear.

41:50.509 --> 41:54.644
"I know you understand
I never meant to hurt you.

41:54.646 --> 41:57.714
"I wanted to protect you.

41:57.716 --> 42:00.783
"I know that you care about me.

42:00.785 --> 42:01.918
"I know we could be together.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.220
"I would do anything for you.

42:04.222 --> 42:06.756
"I didn't want to hit you.

42:06.758 --> 42:09.659
I love you."

42:09.661 --> 42:11.694
See, inside we're the same.

42:11.696 --> 42:14.597
We're the same people.

42:17.536 --> 42:19.602
GAFFNEY:
Thank you, Jesse.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.907
Mr. Unger, how old were you

42:23.909 --> 42:26.943
when you first heard
this woman's voice?

42:26.945 --> 42:28.678
I don't remember.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.747
She's always
with me.

42:30.749 --> 42:33.550
And aside from Lucy Neven,

42:33.552 --> 42:35.685
did the voice ask you

42:35.687 --> 42:37.687
to hurt
other people?

42:37.689 --> 42:39.289
I don't remember.

42:39.291 --> 42:41.758
If you had the opportunity,

42:41.760 --> 42:44.694
would you still want to talk
with Lucy Neven?

42:44.696 --> 42:46.129
Uh-huh.

42:46.131 --> 42:48.598
Would you continue
to write to her?

42:48.600 --> 42:50.700
Yes, I'd have to.

42:50.702 --> 42:52.735
STONE:
If you had
the opportunity,

42:52.737 --> 42:55.138
would you pursue
a relationship with her?

42:55.140 --> 42:57.273
Well, I don't know.

42:57.275 --> 42:58.975
Maybe.

43:00.712 --> 43:02.712
Nothing's changed.

43:02.714 --> 43:05.214
STONE:
Nothing's changed?

43:05.216 --> 43:06.783
No.

43:06.785 --> 43:08.751
Nothing.

43:11.323 --> 43:13.790
<i> So, what are you to decide?</i>

43:13.792 --> 43:15.792
In our society,

43:15.794 --> 43:18.695
we make exceptions
for mental illness.

43:18.697 --> 43:20.997
But should that exception
be made

43:20.999 --> 43:24.667
when it endangers the life
of another human being?

43:24.669 --> 43:27.153
And Jesse Unger

43:27.154 --> 43:29.638
has made it perfectly clear that
he will come after Lucy Neven

43:29.641 --> 43:33.776
again and again until he gets
what he wants from her,

43:33.778 --> 43:36.212
and if he can't have her,

43:36.214 --> 43:38.881
he'll make sure
no one else does.

43:38.883 --> 43:41.684
Now, is this obsession insane?

43:42.988 --> 43:46.990
No one can completely know
the mind of another human being.

43:46.992 --> 43:51.628
We can't crawl inside his skin
and see the world as he sees it.

43:51.630 --> 43:53.029
However, we do know

43:53.031 --> 43:56.766
that Jesse Unger
had no documented history

43:56.768 --> 43:59.936
of delusional episodes
prior to this case.

43:59.938 --> 44:04.641
In fact, he made no mention
of delusions or hearing voices

44:04.643 --> 44:06.242
until after his father

44:06.244 --> 44:10.413
had asked for a second
psychiatric evaluation.

44:10.415 --> 44:13.650
Now, under the law,
we human beings

44:13.652 --> 44:16.919
are responsible for our actions
except for one thing:

44:16.921 --> 44:19.756
delusional mental illness.

44:19.758 --> 44:24.260
Jesse Unger's convenient
and last-minute reporting

44:24.262 --> 44:25.928
of this condition

44:25.930 --> 44:28.798
is a responsible act.

44:28.800 --> 44:32.335
He knows,
as clearly as you or I,

44:32.337 --> 44:35.071
that he brutally attacked
Lucy Neven,

44:35.073 --> 44:37.674
and he knows, just as clearly,

44:37.676 --> 44:41.411
what he has to do
to escape punishment.

44:41.413 --> 44:46.983
Now, he destroyed
Lucy Neven's life.

44:46.985 --> 44:50.386
Hold him responsible for it.

44:54.959 --> 44:56.993
JUDGE:
On the sole count
of the indictment,

44:56.995 --> 44:58.761
attempted murder
in the second degree,

44:58.763 --> 45:00.329
how do you find?

45:00.331 --> 45:02.732
We find
the defendant guilty.

45:02.734 --> 45:05.868
JUDGE:
I thank the jury
for their service.

45:05.870 --> 45:07.770
(<i> gavel bangs</i> )
Court is adjourned.

45:07.772 --> 45:09.405
Sentencing hearing
to be scheduled.

45:12.477 --> 45:14.744
Thank you.

45:31.896 --> 45:33.896
Now, you may not be happy.

45:33.898 --> 45:35.465
Lucy Neven is.

45:35.467 --> 45:37.400
You know as well as I do

45:37.402 --> 45:39.001
that the law ought
to be changed.

45:39.003 --> 45:40.870
Juries are not
psychiatrists.

45:40.872 --> 45:43.139
He never got the help
he needed, Ben,

45:43.141 --> 45:45.875
and the jury followed
the only law we've got.

45:45.877 --> 45:47.477
We're not gods.

45:47.479 --> 45:50.413
We're not even angels.

45:50.415 --> 45:52.148
He should be
in the hospital.

45:52.150 --> 45:54.350
We put him in jail.
