WEBVTT

00:08.537 --> 00:10.205
I thought Cajun food was hot.

00:16.501 --> 00:21.797
D'Marr, what did you call that spice?

00:22.047 --> 00:23.089
Hajjlaran.

00:23.298 --> 00:26.092
The warlords on Preenos
use it to test their courage.

00:28.051 --> 00:29.761
You're sure you won't have some?

00:30.012 --> 00:31.929
My courage doesn't need testing.

00:32.179 --> 00:33.889
I have other items to trade.

00:34.098 --> 00:39.059
I can get you some
Triaxian silk for, say,

00:39.268 --> 00:41.437
another protein resequencer?

00:41.687 --> 00:44.147
I bet you'd look good in Triaxian silk.

00:44.397 --> 00:47.399
What we really need
are engineering supplies.

00:47.607 --> 00:50.776
- Raw duratanium, dilithium ore.
- I'm sorry.

00:51.026 --> 00:54.612
I prefer to deal in more exotic goods.

00:54.821 --> 00:58.699
But about two days from here,
there's a small system.

00:58.907 --> 01:00.826
You might find
what you're looking for there.

01:01.076 --> 01:02.827
We haven't detected
any inhabited planets

01:03.035 --> 01:04.537
on long-range scans.

01:04.787 --> 01:07.455
It's not inhabited. Not exactly.

01:08.581 --> 01:09.582
What do you mean?

01:11.875 --> 01:13.960
This is excellent. What is it, again?

01:14.711 --> 01:16.129
Coffee.

01:16.337 --> 01:21.133
I can have my chef
wrap up a few kilograms for you,

01:21.341 --> 01:25.386
if you wouldn't mind telling us
where we can find those supplies.

01:26.219 --> 01:30.055
Captain, please.
This isn't a matter of negotiation.

01:30.264 --> 01:31.890
I'm thinking of your safety.

01:36.561 --> 01:37.686
Ten kilos?

01:38.186 --> 01:40.355
It's pure luck that I even found it.

01:40.605 --> 01:42.606
- Found what?
- A ship.

01:42.815 --> 01:45.317
Crashed on one of the inner planets.

01:45.526 --> 01:46.818
There were no life-signs aboard,

01:47.026 --> 01:51.321
so I landed to claim
my rights of salvage.

01:51.571 --> 01:55.741
- What did you find?
- A transport vessel, largely intact.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.576
I could have stripped it bare
and made a fortune.

01:58.827 --> 01:59.953
Why didn't you?

02:00.787 --> 02:03.872
The crew objected.

02:04.748 --> 02:07.375
You said there weren't
any life-signs aboard.

02:07.625 --> 02:09.085
There weren't.

02:09.293 --> 02:12.462
There wasn't anything alive.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.965
What are you saying,
the ship was haunted?

02:23.303 --> 02:28.641
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

02:31.101 --> 02:34.520
"It's been a long time"

02:34.728 --> 02:38.564
"But my time is finally near"

02:38.773 --> 02:43.026
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

02:43.235 --> 02:46.153
"I will touch the sky"

02:46.362 --> 02:50.156
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

02:50.365 --> 02:53.367
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

02:53.575 --> 02:58.287
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

02:58.496 --> 03:01.414
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

03:01.623 --> 03:06.210
"I've got faith to believe"

03:06.418 --> 03:09.003
"I can do anything"

03:09.212 --> 03:13.715
"I've got strength of the soul"

03:13.924 --> 03:16.801
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

03:17.009 --> 03:22.347
"I can reach any star"

03:22.722 --> 03:26.475
"I've got faith"

03:26.683 --> 03:30.394
"I've got faith"

03:30.603 --> 03:35.398
"Faith of the heart"

03:37.000 --> 03:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:50.493 --> 03:52.119
The atmosphere is thin,
but breathable.

03:52.327 --> 03:55.747
- Any bio-signs?
- As the trader said, none.

03:56.122 --> 03:57.581
I've located the ship, sir.

03:59.124 --> 04:00.208
Let's see it.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.586
No power signatures.

04:04.836 --> 04:06.505
It appears to be deserted.

04:06.755 --> 04:09.006
But are your sensors
calibrated for ghosts?

04:10.299 --> 04:11.967
So far, D'Marr's batting 1.000.

04:12.175 --> 04:16.094
I'm reading duratanium,
beryllium and dilithium.

04:16.345 --> 04:17.721
I wonder what caused the crash.

04:17.971 --> 04:19.971
There's no way to tell
without a closer look.

04:20.221 --> 04:21.641
Let's get down there.

04:21.891 --> 04:23.184
Are we sure that's a good idea?

04:24.225 --> 04:26.061
You're not afraid it's really haunted,
are you?

04:26.895 --> 04:29.355
We don't know what happened
to the crew.

04:29.563 --> 04:32.106
That ship could be a tomb.

04:32.315 --> 04:35.443
You really think we should be
picking through it for spare parts, sir?

04:35.693 --> 04:38.653
D'Marr didn't say anything
about bodies.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.864
Captain, we've taken more damage
out here than we ever expected to.

04:42.072 --> 04:45.158
There's enough duratanium down
there to patch a lot of hull fractures.

04:48.076 --> 04:49.828
Let's pay her a visit.

04:50.037 --> 04:52.830
If we feel the spirits
don't want us there, we'll leave.

04:53.205 --> 04:55.166
- Malcolm, you have the bridge.
- Aye, sir.

04:55.374 --> 04:58.209
Travis, you're driving.

05:23.020 --> 05:24.562
T'Pol?

05:24.812 --> 05:26.439
Nothing.

05:27.148 --> 05:31.109
According to D'Marr,
Engineering should be that way.

05:31.358 --> 05:32.568
You and T'Pol check it out.

05:32.776 --> 05:35.945
Com us if you find anything
we can use.

05:36.446 --> 05:41.158
Or if you see any signs of the crew.

05:41.366 --> 05:42.576
Aye, captain.

05:53.459 --> 05:55.626
Everything okay, Travis?

05:56.085 --> 05:59.045
Yes, sir. I was just wondering.

05:59.254 --> 06:01.506
If that trader left in such a hurry,

06:01.715 --> 06:04.049
why did he bother to close
the hatch behind him?

06:38.033 --> 06:41.077
- What is it?
- I heard something.

06:43.245 --> 06:45.080
Rats, maybe?

06:49.292 --> 06:50.834
No.

06:51.626 --> 06:54.254
Then you probably imagined it.

06:56.213 --> 06:58.423
Vulcans don't imagine things.

06:58.631 --> 07:00.717
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

07:00.925 --> 07:02.843
A spooky ship, missing crew,

07:03.051 --> 07:05.470
things going bump in the night.

07:05.679 --> 07:08.097
It would give anybody the creeps.

07:12.142 --> 07:13.935
"The creeps"?

07:14.144 --> 07:17.271
Yeah, willies. Heebie-jeebies.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.273
Don't you get frightened
every once in a while?

07:20.690 --> 07:21.983
No.

07:22.190 --> 07:24.734
- Not by anything?
- No.

07:25.986 --> 07:27.570
Too bad.

07:27.778 --> 07:30.113
Nothing like a good scare.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.119
What do you think that trader
really saw down here, sir?

07:38.327 --> 07:39.787
I don't know.

07:39.995 --> 07:44.040
Maybe someone else
wanted to salvage this wreck

07:44.249 --> 07:47.376
- and they were trying to scare him off.
- That makes sense,

07:47.584 --> 07:51.671
except scavengers would have
stripped this ship to the keel.

07:51.921 --> 07:55.465
This isn't turning into one of your
famous ghost stories, is it?

07:55.674 --> 07:58.300
Would make a good one, sir.

08:01.095 --> 08:05.056
What do you think?
Computer terminal?

08:09.767 --> 08:12.728
Yes, sir. There's no power,

08:12.937 --> 08:15.063
but the data modules look intact.

08:15.271 --> 08:16.815
Let's get them back to the ship.

08:17.023 --> 08:19.566
See if we can find out
what happened here.

08:19.817 --> 08:22.026
It's dilithium, all right.

08:26.530 --> 08:29.282
- Something wrong?
- No.

08:29.490 --> 08:31.992
The crystals are in perfect shape.

08:32.534 --> 08:35.578
It wouldn't be that hard
to get this ship flying again.

08:38.288 --> 08:41.374
- What is it?
- There's someone here.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.460
You said there
weren't any bio-signs.

08:45.044 --> 08:46.336
There aren't.

08:46.544 --> 08:49.838
If you're trying to scare me,
I appreciate the effort, but...

08:54.175 --> 08:56.386
- Tucker to Captain Archer.
- Go ahead.

08:56.594 --> 08:57.928
We're not alone down here.

08:58.136 --> 08:59.930
We're on our way.

09:18.276 --> 09:20.820
There's a space
behind this bulkhead.

09:55.930 --> 09:58.223
Why didn't any of this
show up on sensors?

09:58.431 --> 10:01.975
There appears to be a dampening field
in this section of the ship.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.227
What's generating it?

10:05.645 --> 10:08.855
I'm reading a power source,
but I can't pinpoint its location.

10:09.064 --> 10:11.399
Then let's do some pinpointing.

10:20.405 --> 10:22.115
Hi.

10:24.867 --> 10:27.703
Sorry. It's okay.

10:28.204 --> 10:29.746
I'm not gonna hurt you.

10:31.039 --> 10:32.456
Hey! T'Pol!

10:57.016 --> 11:00.727
We were on our way back
from our colony on Kotara Barath.

11:00.935 --> 11:03.188
We came under attack
as we passed this system.

11:03.438 --> 11:05.606
- Who attacked you?
- They didn't introduce themselves,

11:05.814 --> 11:08.065
- they just opened fire.
- We're a supply ship.

11:08.274 --> 11:11.943
We don't carry large weapons.
We tried to defend ourselves.

11:12.194 --> 11:15.988
The captain was able to make a crash
landing. It's a miracle we all survived.

11:16.238 --> 11:17.698
Didn't you send out a distress call?

11:17.948 --> 11:19.949
It would have let the raiders know
where we were.

11:20.408 --> 11:22.744
So you set up this
dampening field to hide?

11:22.952 --> 11:26.288
We were afraid they'd come down
and finish what they started.

11:26.747 --> 11:28.205
How long have you been here?

11:28.456 --> 11:30.708
- Nearly three years.
- Three years?

11:31.292 --> 11:33.918
You've made quite a home
for yourselves here.

11:34.127 --> 11:37.296
- We didn't have much choice.
- Well, you do now.

11:37.504 --> 11:41.048
Our ship is big enough for all of you.
We can take you home.

11:41.841 --> 11:46.303
You're very generous, captain,
but our world is over a year away.

11:46.553 --> 11:48.345
Well, we can't just leave you here.

11:48.596 --> 11:51.890
As you say, we've made
a home for ourselves.

11:56.143 --> 11:59.353
- What about their engines?
- Their dilithium matrix is stable.

11:59.562 --> 12:02.231
They've got plenty
of antimatter reserves.

12:02.523 --> 12:04.357
I think we can get this ship flying.

12:04.607 --> 12:07.860
We've tried, believe me.

12:09.695 --> 12:12.864
We have resources
you may not have.

12:13.906 --> 12:15.240
It's worth a shot.

12:16.950 --> 12:18.326
Thank you, captain.

12:57.480 --> 13:01.316
You startled me.
That's twice in one day.

13:03.693 --> 13:05.778
You ever say anything?

13:07.028 --> 13:10.031
Unless you're unable
to say anything,

13:10.407 --> 13:13.158
in which case I apologize.

13:32.881 --> 13:34.674
Don't touch that.

13:35.842 --> 13:39.302
The power's been routed
to our living area through that relay.

13:39.553 --> 13:41.429
It's very dangerous.

13:41.638 --> 13:44.557
I'm glad you finally decided
to speak up.

13:45.015 --> 13:48.309
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

13:49.477 --> 13:51.186
You...

13:52.604 --> 13:55.231
...know a lot about
your ship's systems?

13:55.773 --> 13:58.025
My father's the engineer.

13:58.233 --> 14:00.568
He taught me how things work.

14:01.528 --> 14:03.779
Well, stick around, then.

14:04.822 --> 14:08.241
You can warn me about whatever else
I need to keep my hands off of.

14:08.449 --> 14:11.493
He's busy. Don't bother him, Liana.

14:13.994 --> 14:17.081
It's okay. I could use the company.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.916
My daughter has
other responsibilities.

14:36.679 --> 14:38.763
These relays are cross-circuited.

14:38.971 --> 14:41.723
Liana and her father rerouted power
where they needed it.

14:41.932 --> 14:46.727
See here? They shunted
helm control to airponics.

14:46.936 --> 14:48.562
Efficient.

14:48.771 --> 14:50.688
But I'll need to reconnect
the bridge systems.

14:50.897 --> 14:53.524
- I'll ask Liana to give you a hand.
- That's not necessary.

14:53.732 --> 14:56.109
- It'll go faster.
- I can take care of it.

14:56.318 --> 14:58.402
She knows the ship's systems
inside and out.

14:58.611 --> 15:01.613
She kept me from getting fried
on a live plasma feed.

15:02.614 --> 15:04.616
Perhaps she can help you, then.

15:04.866 --> 15:06.784
What's that supposed to mean?

15:07.034 --> 15:08.577
By the way you keep
talking about her,

15:08.786 --> 15:11.996
you obviously appreciate
her technical expertise.

15:12.246 --> 15:13.455
She's very competent.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.750
So was the female engineer
on the Xyrillian ship.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.210
You're never gonna let that go,
are you?

15:19.418 --> 15:23.088
I'm simply noting that the last time
you found someone this competent,

15:23.296 --> 15:25.090
you wound up carrying her child.

15:27.257 --> 15:29.425
Am I interrupting?

15:30.051 --> 15:31.093
Not at all.

15:31.552 --> 15:33.303
Commander Tucker and I
were just discussing

15:33.512 --> 15:36.681
his previous repair experience.

15:37.723 --> 15:39.558
I thought you might like
something to eat.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.392
No thank you.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.729
I'm going to remove those
power shunts on the bridge.

15:55.403 --> 15:57.071
Are you hungry?

15:57.279 --> 15:58.989
Thanks.

16:12.166 --> 16:13.708
It's delicious. What is it?

16:13.917 --> 16:17.461
It's called lorella.
We grow it in the airponics bay.

16:17.669 --> 16:19.046
Nothing will take root outside.

16:19.296 --> 16:21.172
I'm not surprised.

16:21.380 --> 16:24.175
It's amazing you were able
to survive out here.

16:32.473 --> 16:34.932
Why do I feel like
it's feeding time at the zoo?

16:36.059 --> 16:37.642
Well, I didn't mean to be rude.

16:37.851 --> 16:39.436
Please.

16:39.686 --> 16:41.854
I wish more women would pay
that much attention to me.

16:42.855 --> 16:44.273
Do you know a lot of women?

16:45.857 --> 16:47.358
Well...

16:47.567 --> 16:49.568
...nearly a third of the crew
is female.

16:50.527 --> 16:54.197
What about on...?
What did you call your planet?

16:54.655 --> 16:56.239
Earth.

16:56.448 --> 16:59.200
I've got lady friends back there,

16:59.409 --> 17:01.619
but nobody special,
if that's what you mean.

17:01.827 --> 17:03.495
Not anymore.

17:04.787 --> 17:08.290
What about your world? Kantare?

17:09.082 --> 17:10.416
What about it?

17:11.251 --> 17:12.835
As soon as we get
your engines fixed,

17:13.044 --> 17:15.463
you'll be going back,
seeing your friends.

17:15.671 --> 17:17.922
I bet you're looking forward to that.

17:21.049 --> 17:22.468
Commander?

17:23.469 --> 17:27.430
- I hear you've been making progress.
- We're getting there.

17:30.557 --> 17:33.684
There is something else
you might be able to help us with.

17:42.983 --> 17:44.358
Your computer core?

17:44.567 --> 17:46.861
It controls all the ship's
vital functions.

17:47.069 --> 17:48.862
Environmental systems,

17:49.070 --> 17:50.905
main power.

17:51.239 --> 17:52.781
You might say it keeps us alive.

17:54.742 --> 17:55.867
These are optronic relays.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.952
Yes, and the system's
beginning to degrade.

17:58.161 --> 18:02.330
- It could fail at any time.
- I've worked on something like this.

18:03.664 --> 18:05.207
On a Xyrillian ship.

18:05.457 --> 18:08.042
- Then you can fix it?
- I can try.

18:08.251 --> 18:11.545
I'll need some diagnostic gear
from Enterprise.

18:13.463 --> 18:15.756
Why don't you come along.

18:16.882 --> 18:18.259
I could buy you lunch.

18:19.260 --> 18:21.678
Thank you, commander,
but we still have a lot to do here.

18:21.928 --> 18:23.512
You've been marooned
for three years.

18:23.721 --> 18:26.015
A change of scenery
for an hour or two couldn't hurt.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.224
Another time.

18:29.058 --> 18:30.143
Okay.

18:31.393 --> 18:33.603
I'll be back before you know it.

18:38.023 --> 18:41.067
- Why can't I go?
- You know why.

18:41.276 --> 18:44.695
What's wrong with seeing their ship,
meeting some of their crew?

18:44.945 --> 18:47.488
I think you've met enough
of their crew already.

18:47.947 --> 18:51.116
These are good people.
They wanna help us.

18:52.617 --> 18:54.369
I promise not to say anything.

18:57.538 --> 19:01.332
Here. This is where they say
their engines were hit.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.166
There's a lot of damage.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.293
Impact damage, sir.

19:05.502 --> 19:08.129
No scorch marks, no melting.

19:08.337 --> 19:11.381
No indications of any weapons fire.

19:12.924 --> 19:14.592
Maybe they were hit
by some kind of weapon

19:14.801 --> 19:16.635
we're not familiar with.

19:16.844 --> 19:19.178
It's possible.

19:19.387 --> 19:21.556
They also say they haven't sent out
a distress call

19:21.764 --> 19:24.015
because it would
give away their position.

19:24.224 --> 19:26.226
You're not buying that either.

19:26.434 --> 19:28.769
They crashed three years ago, sir.

19:28.978 --> 19:31.479
Whoever attacked them
has to be gone by now.

19:31.980 --> 19:34.148
Why are they still hiding?

19:36.066 --> 19:40.277
Just because they're a little skittish
doesn't mean they're up to something.

19:40.486 --> 19:43.446
- There's also their airponics bay.
- What about it?

19:43.655 --> 19:46.408
It's not big enough to feed
all the people on that ship, sir.

19:46.615 --> 19:49.910
- Not by a long shot.
- How are they surviving down there?

19:50.160 --> 19:51.828
Doesn't make any sense.

19:52.078 --> 19:53.871
Do we still have their data module?

19:54.080 --> 19:55.872
It's in Shuttlepod One.

19:56.289 --> 19:57.999
Have Hoshi download it.

19:58.208 --> 19:59.750
Let me know as soon
as she has anything.

19:59.959 --> 20:01.877
Aye, sir.

20:07.548 --> 20:09.299
How many people
are on Enterprise?

20:09.550 --> 20:11.425
- Eighty-three.
- All humans?

20:11.634 --> 20:14.261
Mostly. You met T'Pol. She's Vulcan.

20:14.469 --> 20:17.055
And Dr Phlox is from
a planet called Denobula.

20:17.263 --> 20:18.931
- Can I meet him?
- Are you kidding?

20:19.139 --> 20:21.809
I'd never hear the end of it
if I didn't introduce you.

20:22.017 --> 20:24.686
And there's Porthos,
Captain Archer's dog.

20:24.894 --> 20:26.395
Dog?

20:27.020 --> 20:29.356
I guess you don't
have a word for that.

20:29.564 --> 20:33.984
He's a mammal, four legs, big ears.
Kind of cute.

20:34.192 --> 20:37.737
- What does he do?
- Not much. He's the captain's pet.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.905
Of course. His pet.

20:40.113 --> 20:43.491
I've never seen a dog before.
Can we see it?

20:43.699 --> 20:45.493
I hope you'll have
some time left for me.

20:45.701 --> 20:49.329
I don't know, it sounds like
I'm going to be very busy.

20:49.663 --> 20:53.332
- So tell me about Kantare.
- It's boring.

20:53.582 --> 20:55.375
I wanna hear about the places
you've been.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.043
Our mission's just getting started.

20:57.251 --> 21:00.420
- We haven't been to many planets yet.
- Where are you going next?

21:00.796 --> 21:04.090
No idea. That's the fun part.

21:04.673 --> 21:07.300
Which planet was your favourite?

21:07.509 --> 21:10.094
If I had to choose right now...

21:10.594 --> 21:12.137
...l'd say this one.

21:12.346 --> 21:14.931
Archer to Commander Tucker.

21:16.015 --> 21:18.558
- Go ahead.
- Could you come to my Ready Room?

21:18.767 --> 21:22.853
On my way. Billy, could you continue
this lady's tour?

21:23.103 --> 21:26.898
I still owe you lunch.
I'll meet you in the mess hall.

21:32.110 --> 21:35.029
I hear you've been spending
a lot of time with Liana.

21:36.322 --> 21:38.031
Did T'Pol say something?

21:38.239 --> 21:41.950
Sir, I swear I've been nothing
but a perfect gentleman.

21:42.159 --> 21:43.786
I'm sure you have, Trip.

21:44.036 --> 21:47.288
This doesn't have anything
to do with that.

21:49.748 --> 21:51.082
We were wondering
if you'd noticed

21:51.291 --> 21:54.919
any strange behaviour from her
or any of the others.

21:55.794 --> 21:58.588
Strange behaviour?
What's going on?

22:00.048 --> 22:03.133
Hoshi translated the data module
we found on their ship.

22:03.342 --> 22:06.469
We were able to reconstruct what
happened right before they crashed.

22:06.677 --> 22:08.220
They already told us what happened.

22:09.013 --> 22:11.097
According to this,

22:11.431 --> 22:13.474
they weren't attacked.

22:13.682 --> 22:15.976
There was an accident on board.

22:16.560 --> 22:19.854
- What kind of an accident?
- There are some gaps in the data,

22:20.063 --> 22:23.273
but it looks like some kind
of catastrophic malfunction.

22:23.482 --> 22:26.484
There was a massive depressurization
and the ship went down.

22:27.193 --> 22:30.361
Maybe that data module
was damaged during the crash.

22:31.196 --> 22:33.155
It's not just the data module.

22:34.656 --> 22:36.158
When their story didn't check out,

22:36.366 --> 22:39.327
the captain asked me to run
some detailed scans of the ship.

22:39.535 --> 22:42.746
According to the oxidation rate
in the hull plating...

22:43.580 --> 22:47.041
...that ship's been sitting down there
a lot longer than three years.

22:47.625 --> 22:50.752
It went down nearly
22 years ago, Trip.

22:52.045 --> 22:54.296
That doesn't make any sense.

22:54.504 --> 22:56.797
Check the scans yourself.

22:59.008 --> 23:01.551
Why wouldn't Liana have told me?

23:01.760 --> 23:03.261
The data also shows
that they launched

23:03.470 --> 23:06.930
a number of escape pods
just before the crash.

23:07.181 --> 23:08.473
Malcolm found one.

23:09.140 --> 23:10.766
It was still in orbit.

23:11.684 --> 23:13.643
We're bringing it on board.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.565
This is obviously
someone's final resting place.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.150
What do you expect to accomplish
by opening it?

23:22.358 --> 23:24.443
I'm not quite sure.

23:41.038 --> 23:44.458
I don't believe you'll be
needing my services.

23:45.959 --> 23:47.461
It's Shilat, captain.

23:48.419 --> 23:51.130
I saw him on their ship an hour ago.

23:51.505 --> 23:53.423
Alive.

24:40.457 --> 24:43.793
- Vanilla, huh?
- There are different kinds?

24:44.043 --> 24:46.045
Oh, hundreds.

24:46.254 --> 24:47.629
I like Rocky Road.

24:48.213 --> 24:50.757
That sounds terrible.
Why do they call it that?

24:51.924 --> 24:53.759
I never really thought about it.

24:53.968 --> 24:57.512
I guess because it's got nuts in it.
It's also got marshmallows,

24:57.720 --> 25:00.139
but I don't think that's got
anything to do with the name.

25:00.347 --> 25:01.557
Marshmallows?

25:01.807 --> 25:03.474
They're little...

25:04.142 --> 25:07.145
Well, they're made of sugar, mostly...

25:08.436 --> 25:11.106
You know, I'm not sure
what they are.

25:11.313 --> 25:14.483
Anyway, did you enjoy the tour?

25:14.733 --> 25:17.569
Very much.
I think Sickbay was my favourite.

25:17.777 --> 25:20.737
Dr Phlox let me feed his bat.

25:21.238 --> 25:23.364
He also asked me to lunch.

25:23.614 --> 25:25.658
Had I known you were
gonna be gone so long...

25:25.908 --> 25:27.826
I'm sorry.

25:29.202 --> 25:31.161
Something important came up.

25:32.287 --> 25:33.372
What's wrong?

25:34.123 --> 25:37.500
Liana, how long have you been
on this planet?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.627
Captain Kuulan told you.

25:40.877 --> 25:44.171
- I want you to tell me.
- Why?

25:44.421 --> 25:48.132
Because our scans show your ship
crashed 22 years ago.

25:48.675 --> 25:51.593
- Well, your scans must be wrong.
- That's what I told Captain Archer.

25:51.802 --> 25:55.346
I said there wasn't any reason
for you to lie to us.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.431
Is there?

26:05.062 --> 26:06.979
We found one of your escape pods.

26:08.731 --> 26:10.358
- I think I should go now.
- Liana,

26:10.566 --> 26:12.192
- Take me back.
- There was a body in it.

26:12.401 --> 26:14.319
Been dead for a long time.

26:14.528 --> 26:16.487
It was Shilat.

26:17.238 --> 26:19.155
- Can you explain that to me?
- I can't.

26:19.364 --> 26:22.699
- Tell me what's going on.
- I'm sorry, but I can't.

26:22.908 --> 26:25.494
Please, take me home.

27:05.315 --> 27:06.941
Do you need some help?

27:07.149 --> 27:08.484
Not at all.

27:08.692 --> 27:11.110
I thought you were repairing
the optronic relays.

27:11.903 --> 27:13.696
I've done as much
as I can do for now.

27:13.905 --> 27:17.157
I need to return to Enterprise
to analyse the data.

27:17.366 --> 27:18.741
If you'll excuse me.

27:22.369 --> 27:23.703
Do you need some help?

27:24.287 --> 27:26.246
I need to contact my ship.

27:26.830 --> 27:28.207
Because of what you found.

27:28.957 --> 27:30.416
I don't understand.

27:31.375 --> 27:33.503
You were looking
where you shouldn't have.

27:51.349 --> 27:55.393
- Find T'Pol. I'll talk to the captain.
- It's better if we stay together, sir.

27:55.602 --> 27:58.062
You don't have to do this.
You're not in any danger here.

27:58.395 --> 28:01.357
That would be easier to believe
if you weren't hiding things from us.

28:01.939 --> 28:03.983
Can't you just fix
our systems and go?

28:04.192 --> 28:06.318
Is that what you really want?

28:06.526 --> 28:10.071
How old were you
when your ship crashed? Five, 6?

28:10.279 --> 28:12.698
Do you even remember
what your home looks like?

28:12.907 --> 28:14.449
This is my home.

28:15.408 --> 28:16.701
Liana.

28:17.993 --> 28:20.579
I didn't tell them anything.

28:20.996 --> 28:22.371
No, she didn't.

28:22.955 --> 28:26.374
But if you want any more help from us,
we're gonna need some answers.

28:26.625 --> 28:28.168
We don't owe you answers.

28:29.209 --> 28:30.419
Take their weapons.

28:34.589 --> 28:37.924
Please, just let them leave. That's
what you wanted in the first place.

28:38.175 --> 28:40.552
When the repairs are completed.

28:44.889 --> 28:47.182
Make him stop. He'll listen to you.

28:49.725 --> 28:51.477
Go back to your ship.

28:51.935 --> 28:53.519
Not without my officers.

28:53.769 --> 28:55.771
This isn't a negotiation.

29:06.571 --> 29:08.197
Liana.

29:17.203 --> 29:18.538
Get to work.

29:19.789 --> 29:22.041
- Where's T'Pol?
- Don't worry about her.

29:22.249 --> 29:24.625
- I'm gonna need her help.
- You can do it on your own.

29:25.126 --> 29:27.170
I'm not doing a thing until I see her.

29:27.420 --> 29:30.714
Do as I say or you'll never see her.

29:31.256 --> 29:33.424
What's so important about this thing?

29:33.632 --> 29:35.551
You'd really kill us
to keep it running?

29:36.177 --> 29:38.052
You wouldn't understand.

29:38.261 --> 29:40.013
I don't care what your big secret is.

29:40.221 --> 29:42.973
It doesn't matter if you've been here
three years or 30.

29:43.181 --> 29:45.600
But you gotta think about Liana.

29:46.183 --> 29:48.768
We can help you take her home.

29:49.352 --> 29:51.271
Just fix those relays.

29:51.521 --> 29:54.815
You got a lot to learn
about making friends.

29:56.983 --> 30:00.318
I've made all the friends I need.

30:04.989 --> 30:07.283
I'm sick of hearing
that he's doing this for me.

30:07.491 --> 30:08.992
I don't believe it anymore.

30:09.200 --> 30:11.327
I wouldn't be alive
if it wasn't for your father.

30:11.536 --> 30:14.663
- He should have told them the truth.
- You know he can't do that.

30:14.872 --> 30:17.415
He can do whatever he wants.
He's not like you.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.792
You shouldn't have gone
to their ship.

30:21.459 --> 30:22.836
You think this is my fault?

30:23.044 --> 30:25.170
I saw the way
you looked at their engineer.

30:25.421 --> 30:27.214
Are you sure
you didn't say anything?

30:27.464 --> 30:29.590
No, I didn't.

30:30.174 --> 30:33.969
They'll be gone soon,
and everything will be fine again.

30:41.975 --> 30:45.060
We'll set the shuttle down
in the foothills, south of their ship.

30:45.269 --> 30:46.812
Won't they pick us up on sensors?

30:47.020 --> 30:49.480
Their dampening field
should leave them as blind as we are.

30:49.689 --> 30:52.649
Unfortunately, that rules out
using the transporter as well.

30:52.899 --> 30:54.776
We'll go in through
their escape-pod ports.

30:54.985 --> 30:57.444
That should put us near Engineering
and their computer room.

30:57.695 --> 31:01.531
And with a bit of luck,
near T'Pol and Commander Tucker.

31:05.242 --> 31:07.576
That's a pretty neat trick.

31:08.244 --> 31:11.579
Here you are, watching me
with a gun in your hand,

31:11.788 --> 31:15.791
while at the same time
your corpse is up on Enterprise.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.961
What do you do for an encore?

31:22.880 --> 31:24.297
Would you wait outside.

31:24.965 --> 31:26.550
I'm not supposed to leave him.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.217
It's all right.

31:40.726 --> 31:42.979
They do what I ask them to.

31:43.436 --> 31:45.647
Then why don't you ask them
to let me go.

31:45.855 --> 31:47.731
I wish I could.

31:48.983 --> 31:52.443
Maybe you can tell me how
I'm being guarded by a dead man.

31:54.445 --> 31:58.698
Do you think it's possible
to tell a lie so many times

31:58.907 --> 32:02.201
that you begin
to believe it's the truth?

32:04.494 --> 32:06.371
You can.

32:07.830 --> 32:11.415
I never really understood that
until you came.

32:14.001 --> 32:17.045
Remember when you said
you thought we were ghosts?

32:20.547 --> 32:23.800
In a way, you were right.

32:28.720 --> 32:31.472
Work your way down the port side.

32:31.680 --> 32:33.808
Com us if you find T'Pol.

32:34.016 --> 32:37.060
- And be careful.
- Aye, sir.

33:15.963 --> 33:18.799
That's why your father needs
to keep this running.

33:19.508 --> 33:21.176
Yes.

33:23.052 --> 33:24.470
You can stop this.

33:36.479 --> 33:37.730
- You all right?
- Yeah.

33:37.939 --> 33:40.315
- Where did he come from?
- Good question.

33:45.611 --> 33:47.779
You have to get them off the ship.

33:58.953 --> 34:00.121
Liana, please.

34:00.622 --> 34:03.332
If you don't, my friends could die.

34:03.790 --> 34:04.917
Please.

35:07.755 --> 35:09.839
What happened to your crew?

35:10.047 --> 35:12.800
They're gone, captain.
Isn't it obvious?

35:13.091 --> 35:14.468
Your real crew.

35:16.344 --> 35:18.804
They didn't seem real to you?

35:19.180 --> 35:21.139
I created them.

35:21.347 --> 35:22.599
Wasn't easy.

35:23.057 --> 35:24.851
Took time.

35:25.392 --> 35:27.311
You could touch them.

35:27.644 --> 35:29.562
They could make you laugh.

35:29.770 --> 35:31.105
Surprise you.

35:31.564 --> 35:32.773
They were holograms.

35:34.607 --> 35:39.278
They were our friends, our family,
for over 20 years.

35:39.486 --> 35:43.406
They're the only people
I've ever known, besides my father.

35:43.614 --> 35:44.781
Until you came.

35:45.991 --> 35:47.617
But the ones you based them on,

35:47.868 --> 35:50.911
the crew of this ship,
where are they?

35:51.787 --> 35:54.622
I buried them out in the hills.

35:54.831 --> 35:58.083
The ones I could find
after the crash.

35:59.001 --> 36:01.961
- I killed them, so I buried them.
- That isn't true.

36:02.169 --> 36:05.255
You don't remember.
You were a child.

36:07.215 --> 36:10.634
We were on our way home,
just like Kuulan told you.

36:10.843 --> 36:12.927
But we weren't attacked.

36:13.136 --> 36:16.888
There was an ion storm.
It overloaded our plasma conduits.

36:17.097 --> 36:22.184
I was the chief engineer.
It was my responsibility to start repairs.

36:22.393 --> 36:25.729
But it was worse than I thought.

36:25.937 --> 36:29.606
Leaking plasma
burned through the hull.

36:29.815 --> 36:31.442
We were losing atmosphere,

36:31.650 --> 36:35.069
so Captain Kuulan set a course
for this planet.

36:35.278 --> 36:38.530
Sounds like you did everything
you could to save the ship.

36:39.281 --> 36:42.700
They're all dead.
Apparently I didn't do enough.

36:44.034 --> 36:46.160
- They died because of me.
- No.

36:46.953 --> 36:49.204
It was my decision.

36:50.247 --> 36:52.748
She was in our quarters,
on the lowest deck.

36:52.957 --> 36:56.376
I knew she'd never survive
a crash landing down there.

36:56.584 --> 36:57.794
So I went to get her.

36:59.421 --> 37:01.547
Any father would have done
the same thing.

37:01.797 --> 37:04.590
I left my station.

37:04.799 --> 37:08.343
The plasma leak grew,
there was an explosion.

37:08.552 --> 37:12.888
Half the crew died instantly,
including my wife.

37:14.348 --> 37:18.476
A few made it
to the escape pods, but...

37:21.103 --> 37:27.400
I can't imagine what making
that decision must have been like.

37:28.566 --> 37:30.443
But it was a long time ago.

37:30.694 --> 37:33.529
You need to consider
your daughter now.

37:34.279 --> 37:36.698
Why do you think I did this?

37:36.906 --> 37:40.158
To retreat into some fantasy,
pretend it never happened?

37:40.367 --> 37:43.869
For two years,
I tried to repair our ship.

37:44.078 --> 37:48.248
And I watched my daughter
grow up alone.

37:49.457 --> 37:52.000
So I decided to bring them back.

37:52.209 --> 37:57.922
Her mother first,
then Captain Kuulan and the others.

37:58.130 --> 38:02.676
I did everything I could
to make it like it was, for her.

38:02.926 --> 38:04.260
She deserves more.

38:06.553 --> 38:09.013
I've given her everything she needs.

38:09.263 --> 38:11.473
- And when you're gone?
- Trip, please.

38:11.682 --> 38:13.934
Are you gonna let her
bury you out in the hills?

38:14.893 --> 38:19.145
Then live the rest of her life
with these people you created?

38:19.729 --> 38:22.023
What if the relays burn out again?

38:22.232 --> 38:23.649
Then she'll really be alone.

38:23.899 --> 38:26.360
She's my daughter.
It's not your concern.

38:28.402 --> 38:30.530
What if she gets hurt?

38:31.321 --> 38:33.031
What do you do then?

38:33.240 --> 38:36.492
Program a holographic doctor?

38:36.742 --> 38:38.702
We've survived here successfully.

38:39.285 --> 38:41.329
Maybe you have.

38:41.913 --> 38:43.789
Ask Liana how she feels.

38:44.039 --> 38:47.083
Ask her if just surviving is enough.

38:53.588 --> 38:55.422
You all right?

38:58.841 --> 39:00.802
We'll finish working
on your holographic systems,

39:01.010 --> 39:03.053
if that's what you want.

39:03.970 --> 39:06.806
But you should be sure
that's all the help you need from us.

39:07.014 --> 39:10.476
It may be a long time
before anyone comes by here again.

39:19.774 --> 39:20.775
Come in.

39:30.282 --> 39:32.033
Welcome aboard.

39:32.241 --> 39:34.118
Thank you, captain.

39:37.579 --> 39:40.372
You have a beautiful ship.

39:40.623 --> 39:42.791
Thanks. We're pretty proud of her.

39:46.793 --> 39:49.963
- May I sit?
- Of course.

39:57.052 --> 39:59.845
I haven't been in space
for a long time.

40:00.054 --> 40:02.305
It feels strange.

40:02.513 --> 40:04.140
Good...

40:04.557 --> 40:06.308
...just a bit strange.

40:07.768 --> 40:09.686
Can I get you something?

40:09.895 --> 40:11.729
- Some tea?
- I'm fine.

40:14.939 --> 40:16.858
No, I'm not.

40:18.859 --> 40:22.361
Your engineer is
a very plain-spoken man.

40:23.738 --> 40:26.531
That's one way of putting it.

40:31.660 --> 40:35.914
I've never kept secrets
from my daughter.

40:36.122 --> 40:42.168
She knows there's more to see
beyond our little oasis.

40:42.376 --> 40:46.171
But she's never talked about leaving.

40:47.088 --> 40:48.965
Not once.

40:49.174 --> 40:53.801
Now your engineer thinks
we should just pack up and go.

40:56.596 --> 40:59.264
Twenty-two years, captain.

41:00.015 --> 41:02.266
I've lived here for 22 years.

41:02.475 --> 41:08.396
That ship down there may seem like
nothing more than spare parts to you,

41:08.646 --> 41:12.858
but to me, it's home.

41:13.066 --> 41:15.151
I don't want to leave.

41:15.359 --> 41:18.028
I'm happy here.

41:20.447 --> 41:22.156
Comfortable.

41:25.241 --> 41:29.536
But Mr Tucker wants me to believe
that I'm being selfish.

41:29.745 --> 41:32.414
He says now that I have the
opportunity to leave, I should,

41:32.622 --> 41:35.499
that Liana deserves more.

41:39.711 --> 41:44.339
Maybe it's time I stopped
being so afraid of change.

41:47.717 --> 41:50.135
Will you help me
take my daughter home?

41:51.595 --> 41:54.388
We'll stay as long as it takes
to get your ship flying.

41:55.014 --> 41:58.641
Thank you, captain,
but all we need are these components.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.727
I've got my own crew to do the work.

42:01.935 --> 42:04.813
Some of them are
pretty fair engineers.

42:05.062 --> 42:06.856
I saw to that.

42:20.241 --> 42:22.158
- How's it going?
- Good.

42:22.367 --> 42:24.660
We're about to start realigning
the antimatter injectors.

42:25.202 --> 42:26.787
That was fast.

42:27.913 --> 42:30.957
- What's that?
- It's a protein resequencer.

42:31.165 --> 42:34.042
I figured you must be tired of eating
the same food all the time.

42:34.543 --> 42:38.379
I programmed it
for making ice cream.

42:38.879 --> 42:43.508
Only five flavours,
but they're good ones.

42:43.717 --> 42:45.175
Rocky Road?

42:45.384 --> 42:48.845
You didn't think I'd send you off
without Rocky Road?

42:49.303 --> 42:51.013
Thank you.

42:52.889 --> 42:56.392
Are you sure you don't want us
to stay for a while? Lend a hand?

42:56.809 --> 42:58.644
You've got a lot more places to go.

42:59.353 --> 43:01.020
So do you.

43:14.698 --> 43:16.865
Maybe I'll see you out there.

43:18.075 --> 43:19.618
I'd like that.
