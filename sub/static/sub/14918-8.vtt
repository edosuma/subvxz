00:21.952 --> 00:23.422
Justin, hey. It's me.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.178
Um, listen, I know
you're busy with midterms.

00:26.178 --> 00:29.181
Uh, I was just...
Well, um...

00:30.899 --> 00:31.881
You know what?
Just call me back.

00:31.881 --> 00:33.949
I have something I really need
to talk to you about, okay?

00:34.470 --> 00:35.175
Bye.

00:38.302 --> 00:40.484
I can't believe we're picking
the mother of our child online.

00:40.484 --> 00:42.217
I've never even hooked up
with anyone online.

00:42.217 --> 00:44.553
really? No, me neither.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.679
Once.
Right.

00:47.679 --> 00:49.612
Okay, ready to meet her?
Ready.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.114
Three, two, one.

00:55.285 --> 00:56.786
Oh, my god.

00:56.853 --> 00:59.055
Oh, wow.
There's so many.

00:59.122 --> 01:02.925
138 women vying for our sperm.
Yeah, and they're gonna
be menopausal

01:02.925 --> 01:04.197
By the time
we get through them.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.394
Oh, look, we can whittle it down
by checking some of those boxes.

01:06.394 --> 01:08.834
Try ethnicity.
Oh. I thought we didn't care.

01:08.878 --> 01:12.473
We don't. Uh, eye color. Blue?
Well, you just said you
didn't care about ethnicity.

01:14.096 --> 01:16.147
Good point.
But, I mean, if you feel
passionately about--

01:16.147 --> 01:17.840
No, no, no. I just--
I just thought we would,

01:17.908 --> 01:19.809
You know, it--it doesn't matter.
Let's do height.

01:19.876 --> 01:21.844
It's well documented
that tall people

01:21.912 --> 01:24.313
Have an easier time of it in life.
Great.

01:24.381 --> 01:26.608
"5'5" or taller."
here we go.

01:29.486 --> 01:32.688
Wow. 107. That's all right.
We'll get through it eventually.
How?

01:32.756 --> 01:35.591
By going through each
and every one of them.

01:35.659 --> 01:37.593
Yeah, but what exactly
are we looking for?

01:37.661 --> 01:38.817
I'm sure they all have
their pros or cons.

01:38.817 --> 01:40.216
The best one, scotty.

01:41.832 --> 01:42.576
Right.

01:45.435 --> 01:46.936
Can you see the difference?

01:47.004 --> 01:49.071
Mom, you're so close.
I can't see anything.

01:49.139 --> 01:50.906
There.
I should've taken a "before" picture.

01:50.974 --> 01:52.908
I'm telling you.
This stuff is a miracle.

01:52.976 --> 01:56.212
You just dab it on, and I have
the lashes of a 20 year old.

01:56.947 --> 01:58.614
Wow. You really like
this guy.

01:58.614 --> 02:00.786
The eyelashes are for me,
not for him.

02:01.358 --> 02:02.318
No, we're just
having lunch today

02:02.386 --> 02:05.087
So I can ask him
about kitty's blood work.

02:05.155 --> 02:06.622
He's an oncologist.

02:07.463 --> 02:10.152
You're using kitty's cancer
as a cover?

02:10.152 --> 02:11.594
Mom, that's just so skanky.
No, I am not.

02:11.662 --> 02:14.196
I never, ever would do that.
Not ever.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.732
You know, we've had a few
meals together. That's all.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.265
No hanky-panky?
No!

02:19.265 --> 02:23.524
Okay. Sorry. Okay.
No. God, Sarah. He's 20 years
younger than I am.

02:24.281 --> 02:26.328
But I think he wants to.
It's weird.

02:26.328 --> 02:29.469
Don't you think that's weird?
No, I don't think it's weird.

02:29.469 --> 02:32.466
It would be weird if he wanted
to have a family with you.

02:32.466 --> 02:34.810
That wouldn't be weird.
That would be impossible.

02:34.810 --> 02:36.484
Just be thankful
that he's got

02:36.484 --> 02:40.048
A social security number
and a job.
what are you talking about?

02:40.842 --> 02:42.670
Luc has a job.
He's an artist.

02:42.670 --> 02:45.382
He's a painter.
He paints.

02:45.382 --> 02:46.808
Is that why
you came over here,

02:46.808 --> 02:48.848
To vent to me
about your "live-in" boyfriend?

02:48.848 --> 02:52.601
You know what his plans
for today are?

02:52.669 --> 02:55.396
Laundry, market and maybe
squeeze in a workout

02:55.396 --> 02:57.888
Before he takes paige and coop
over to joe's.

02:57.888 --> 03:00.776
That sounds productive.
Mom, it sounds like
an au pair.

03:00.844 --> 03:03.679
there are worse
things than being an au pair.

03:03.747 --> 03:05.948
And besides that,
you need one.

03:06.016 --> 03:08.584
Well, it sounds great.
I know I should love it.

03:08.652 --> 03:11.454
But I don't like who I become
when I actually have one.

03:11.521 --> 03:13.289
Stop doing that.

03:13.356 --> 03:15.691
You're gonna rub
the magic potion right off.

03:15.759 --> 03:17.626
Sarah, listen to me.

03:17.694 --> 03:19.495
Luc is not joe.

03:23.360 --> 03:24.266
Hey, Saul.

03:25.844 --> 03:26.958
She what?

03:26.958 --> 03:29.353
Okay, slow down.
Ugh. All right.

03:29.353 --> 03:30.598
On the way.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.701
Jane. She's reviewed
our strategies.

03:35.701 --> 03:36.984
She's not happy.

03:36.984 --> 03:40.376
How that woman became chair of
the board, I will never know.

03:40.376 --> 03:42.017
No one else wanted the job.
Well...

03:42.085 --> 03:43.953
Bye, mom.

03:44.732 --> 03:46.355
Maybe I should've given it
to luc.

03:46.899 --> 03:48.925
Well, if you had,
I would go to the meeting.

03:48.925 --> 03:51.651
Well, you can't.
You've got a date.

03:53.230 --> 03:56.532
We aren't entering anything
into the competition?

03:56.600 --> 04:00.003
I don't get it. This festival
is a wonderful opportunity

04:00.003 --> 04:01.528
For brand exposure.

04:01.763 --> 04:02.753
The press will be there,

04:02.753 --> 04:05.130
Chefs and retailers
from around the country.

04:05.577 --> 04:08.570
I mean, can we afford
just to sit back and waste it?

04:08.570 --> 04:09.647
We won't be wasting it.

04:09.647 --> 04:12.513
We'll still have a very,
very significant presence.

04:12.513 --> 04:15.117
Right, and we'll be pouring
all of our wine in our booth.

04:15.185 --> 04:18.187
The booth is magnificent, too,
thanks to Ryan and Rebecca.

04:18.254 --> 04:19.988
Oh, no problem.

04:20.055 --> 04:22.992
What about this cheap blend?
Where are we with that?

04:23.059 --> 04:26.389
The coastal reserve?
Well, it's coming along nicely.

04:26.389 --> 04:28.439
And we are going to test it
next quarter.

04:28.439 --> 04:31.400
 Next quarter? Wasn't the whole point
behind this hail-mary idea

04:31.468 --> 04:33.177
To bring us some revenue now?

04:33.177 --> 04:35.659
Yes, I mean,
that is the goal,

04:35.659 --> 04:37.873
But it takes time
to launch a new wine.

04:37.873 --> 04:39.477
This company
doesn't have time.

04:43.021 --> 04:45.967
Well, we could taste it.
S-see what we've got.

04:45.967 --> 04:48.577
No, it's not ready. Saul--
well, I-I don't know.

04:48.577 --> 04:50.628
Maybe we should taste it.
Maybe that's a good idea.

04:50.628 --> 04:52.085
At least we'll figure out
what we've got.

04:52.085 --> 04:56.025
What are we waiting for?
Okay. Let's go for it.

04:57.420 --> 04:58.116
hey.

04:59.058 --> 04:59.692
Thanks.

04:59.985 --> 05:02.525
We just blended it recently.

05:02.713 --> 05:04.010
I'm aware.

05:04.534 --> 05:05.407
Cheers.

05:06.102 --> 05:08.137
Here we go.

05:16.212 --> 05:18.080
Saul?

05:18.148 --> 05:19.077
I don't know.

05:20.430 --> 05:22.793
I don't know what to say.
This wine is, uh...

05:27.086 --> 05:28.328
This wine is good.

05:29.952 --> 05:31.625
It's amazing--the balance--

05:31.625 --> 05:33.450
It's--it's exquisite.

05:33.730 --> 05:35.764
You're joking.
No, no. I'm not joking.

05:35.832 --> 05:38.534
I-I-I think this wine
should be in the festival.

05:38.601 --> 05:39.215
Are you serious?

05:39.215 --> 05:41.495
I'm serious.
It needs to be tasted now.

05:41.495 --> 05:45.238
I would go so far as to say
that this wine should compete.

05:45.508 --> 05:47.109
Compete?
Yes, compete.

05:47.177 --> 05:47.906
I don't think you understand.

05:47.906 --> 05:51.906
This wine--this very wine--
is lightning in a bottle.

05:51.906 --> 05:54.550
Okay, but the festival's
tomorrow.

05:54.617 --> 05:56.112
All right, Rebecca,
sweetheart, do me a favor.

05:56.112 --> 05:58.125
Call joyce Keenan
at the festival office.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.872
Tell her that we have a red
for the table wine class, okay?

06:00.872 --> 06:02.770
And if there's any problem, you 
have her call me.

06:04.571 --> 06:06.403
I could call some people
we've already used or--

06:06.403 --> 06:09.104
Oh, my god.
I've got an artist.
What do you mean?

06:09.104 --> 06:12.491
Well, he's french,
from wine country.
Oh! Is he available?

06:12.491 --> 06:13.584
Absolutely.

06:13.584 --> 06:14.225
Well, it looks like

06:14.225 --> 06:18.047
We are going to launch a wine
overnight after all.

06:18.639 --> 06:20.817
Okay, cheers.
Cheers.

06:20.844 --> 06:21.511
Here goes.

06:38.001 --> 06:39.337
We need to be quiet.

06:40.440 --> 06:44.243
My wife could be here
at any minute.

06:44.310 --> 06:47.980
D-do you like it?

06:48.047 --> 06:50.349
Do you think, um...

06:50.416 --> 06:52.384
Do you think
maybe it's too short or--

06:52.452 --> 06:55.087
I think it's great.

06:57.523 --> 06:59.825
Robert, you, um...

06:59.892 --> 07:03.195
You have a flight
to catch, right?

07:03.263 --> 07:06.331
Oh, they'll wait.

07:17.442 --> 07:19.417
I don't understand. Why would I
want to do a label?

07:19.417 --> 07:20.806
Because when you
think about it,

07:21.531 --> 07:22.857
It's just a small painting.

07:22.857 --> 07:25.865
A very small painting.
Oh, come on.
We'll pay you for it.

07:25.865 --> 07:29.199
I don't need the money.
Well, think of it
as another creative outlet.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.061
You know, like my ex--

07:31.061 --> 07:32.895
Joe--he only wanted
to do his own music.

07:32.895 --> 07:35.317
But then he got into doing
jingles for commercials,

07:35.317 --> 07:36.805
And he absolutely loves it.

07:36.805 --> 07:39.606
If this is successful,
we'll be in "wine spectator"

07:39.606 --> 07:42.376
And in every market
on all the shelves.

07:44.050 --> 07:46.351
So my painting
next to a bag of chips?

07:46.351 --> 07:49.143
No. No, no, no. That's
a completely different aisle.

07:49.143 --> 07:51.260
Oh, yeah?
You're so talented
and creative.

07:51.260 --> 07:54.466
I know you'll do
something beautiful.
Maybe. I don't know.

07:54.466 --> 07:57.469
I'm sorry,
but I don't paint on demand.

07:57.469 --> 08:00.265
Please...
Let's have some lunch.

08:00.265 --> 08:02.481
No, I can't have lunch.
I have a deadline.

08:02.947 --> 08:05.920
I know that you have
your career in France,

08:05.920 --> 08:09.520
But this could really open up
some opportunities for you

08:09.520 --> 08:12.062
In this country.
This is not what I do.

08:12.062 --> 08:14.459
What about your visa?
What about it?

08:14.459 --> 08:15.725
Well, have you thought about
getting one?

08:15.725 --> 08:17.572
You know, because with
this kind of work,

08:17.572 --> 08:20.758
Ojai could sponsor you.
Babe, I'm not worried
about the visa.

08:20.758 --> 08:23.873
We have time.
Would you just do it?

08:25.321 --> 08:27.940
O-okay. I-I do it for you.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.729
No, don't do it for me.
Do it for you.

08:32.187 --> 08:33.914
Babe, I do a lot of things
for myself.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.153
This one is for you.

08:37.092 --> 08:38.914
Dr. Avadon said
these look great.

08:38.914 --> 08:40.644
What do you think?
I think she's right.

08:42.436 --> 08:44.302
Nora, doctors don't give
good news to be nice.

08:44.302 --> 08:45.701
No, I know. I--I'm sorry.

08:45.701 --> 08:47.540
I'm really not asking
for a second opinion.

08:47.540 --> 08:49.310
But you're an oncologist.

08:49.310 --> 08:51.920
It's hard for me not to want
to pick your brain all the time.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.665
She's your daughter.
I completely understand.

08:53.665 --> 08:56.118
I know you do. Thank you.
So I'm g--

08:56.118 --> 08:58.128
I'm putting these away...
Far away.

08:59.327 --> 09:02.956
L-let's take a long ride
up p.C.H.

09:02.956 --> 09:04.774
I know this wonderful
little restaurant

09:04.774 --> 09:07.013
Way past malibu.
Oh. How about tomorrow?

09:07.829 --> 09:09.708
Oh, I can't tomorrow.
I've got the wine festival.

09:09.708 --> 09:10.938
Well, that sounds fun.

09:10.938 --> 09:14.529
No, it's the family business.
It's just... A lot of work.

09:15.109 --> 09:18.072
A lot of work or... A lot
of people you know?

09:18.932 --> 09:20.482
What does that mean?
Well, I'm just saying,

09:20.482 --> 09:22.480
We've gone to a lot
of secluded places lately.

09:24.108 --> 09:26.116
You're not embarrassed
to be seen with me, are you?

09:26.116 --> 09:28.544
God, no. No, no.
Why would I be?

09:28.544 --> 09:30.040
Maybe because
I'm younger than you.

09:30.502 --> 09:32.440
Yes. No, I...

09:32.440 --> 09:33.983
I don't care about that.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.840
Come to the festival.
Come.

09:42.264 --> 09:43.871
I want you to come.
You have to come.

09:43.871 --> 09:46.705
I don't want
to pressure you.
No, it's no pressure.

09:46.705 --> 09:48.966
It's no pressure.
I really want you to come.

09:50.356 --> 09:51.254
Do you have something
in your eye?

09:51.254 --> 09:53.482
No, no, no, I have--
it's an allergy.

10:05.982 --> 10:07.231
Why are you studying
the spinal cord?

10:07.231 --> 10:08.236
That's not on the test.

10:09.158 --> 10:10.126
Is that a joke?

10:10.126 --> 10:12.309
No. The exam is
the upper extremities,

10:12.309 --> 10:13.437
The abdomen and the thorax.

10:13.437 --> 10:16.255
The spinal cord runs through
the abdomen and the thorax.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.694
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

10:24.734 --> 10:25.388
Hey.

10:25.388 --> 10:27.212
Hey,
did you get my message?

10:27.212 --> 10:30.928
Um, I... What's up?
Nothing. I'm just--I've been
trying to get ahold of you.

10:30.928 --> 10:32.527
Justin--
I know, I know.

10:32.527 --> 10:34.398
You know?
Rebecca, you know, I'm in--
I'm in the study lab,

10:34.398 --> 10:36.659
And, uh, I-I can't talk
on the phone right now so--

10:36.659 --> 10:40.605
It's the posterior funiculus.
Well, can you go outside
and call me back?

10:40.605 --> 10:42.379
I can't. I just found out
the spinal cord's

10:42.379 --> 10:44.103
Gonna be on the test,
and there's a list of nerves

10:44.103 --> 10:46.424
That I need to learn by tomorrow
morning and where they go, so--

10:48.318 --> 10:49.252
I'm gonna
have to call you back.

10:49.252 --> 10:50.447
Justin--
Bye.

10:52.176 --> 10:53.356
Bye.

10:55.261 --> 10:56.900
Good talk. We're pregnant.

11:00.612 --> 11:02.680
Are you sure that Sarah
isn't gonna be mad at me

11:02.680 --> 11:07.061
For not going to the festival?
No. It's not like you don't
have a good excuse.

11:07.061 --> 11:08.790
And I'm glad
you're staying home with evan.

11:08.790 --> 11:12.783
What are you doing?
It's this wig. It's this wig.
Robert is crazy about this wig.

11:12.783 --> 11:14.779
It's--it's like he's not
having sex with me.

11:14.779 --> 11:16.651
He's having sex with her.

11:16.651 --> 11:19.029
You make the wig
sound like the other woman.

11:19.097 --> 11:21.886
Well, it... It kinda feels
like that.

11:21.886 --> 11:24.868
Have you even let him
see you without "her"?

11:24.868 --> 11:25.938
God, no, mother.

11:25.938 --> 11:27.633
He doesn't need
to be put through that.

11:28.403 --> 11:30.434
Sweetheart, he's your husband.
He loves you.

11:30.434 --> 11:31.975
You know, look, mom,

11:32.043 --> 11:34.586
Just because your romantic heart
is very full right now

11:34.586 --> 11:36.212
Doesn't mean that--
what does that mean?

11:36.212 --> 11:40.478
Oh. Sarah told me
about motorcycle man.

11:40.478 --> 11:41.305
well...

11:42.248 --> 11:44.288
I invited him
to the wine festival.

11:44.356 --> 11:46.323
I-I had to. He cornered me.
I'm gonna call him

11:46.323 --> 11:47.962
And I'm gonna cancel it.
Why?

11:47.962 --> 11:50.832
Because I could just imagine
what everybody's gonna say.

11:51.369 --> 11:54.176
"oh, look. Nora's with someone
half her age.

11:54.176 --> 11:57.113
I wonder if she paid him."
you know, if you're not
ready to do this, mom,

11:57.113 --> 11:58.242
Then you're not ready
to do this.

11:58.242 --> 11:59.955
I mean,
everything happens on time.

11:59.955 --> 12:02.228
I really believe that.
Look at me.

12:02.228 --> 12:07.094
I'm not ready to go without...
Girlfriend here.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.123
Wait one minute. No.

12:08.123 --> 12:10.791
You can't use me as an excuse
to hide from your husband.

12:10.791 --> 12:13.122
You know what?
I'll make you a deal.

12:13.122 --> 12:16.611
I will go to the wine festival
with motorcycle man

12:16.611 --> 12:19.935
If you kick girlfriend
out of the bed.

12:20.898 --> 12:21.615
Is that a deal?

12:22.765 --> 12:23.702
Kitty?

12:24.076 --> 12:26.953
Kitty?
Okay, fine. Deal.

12:27.165 --> 12:28.521
yeah, let's do that.

12:28.521 --> 12:29.926
And let's keep the ukuleles.

12:30.648 --> 12:32.598
I know,
I canceled them before.

12:32.598 --> 12:34.834
But I think it would be
so great and so hawaiian.

12:35.553 --> 12:38.381
Okay, great. Thanks. Bye.

12:38.955 --> 12:40.429
Ukulele players?

12:40.965 --> 12:43.543
Not for the festival.
For the wedding.

12:43.543 --> 12:46.180
Rebecca put music
at the top of her list.

12:47.158 --> 12:48.920
So that means
that the luau dancers

12:48.920 --> 12:50.732
And the tiki torches
are back in, too?

12:50.732 --> 12:53.384
David, it's not like
I'm buying a yacht.

12:53.384 --> 12:56.418
This is just entertainment
for our daughter's wedding.

12:57.064 --> 12:58.214
All right.
I'll take that as a yes.

12:59.172 --> 13:00.631
And I get it.

13:00.631 --> 13:03.510
You know, last week,
your portfolio was obliterated,

13:03.510 --> 13:04.881
But now you're
feeling optimistic

13:04.881 --> 13:06.023
Because of your new wine.

13:06.023 --> 13:09.680
<i>Yeah. Wine that saul loved.
Saul.</i>

13:09.680 --> 13:13.214
And Sarah is being
completely supportive of me,

13:13.214 --> 13:14.933
Which is something
I never thought

13:14.933 --> 13:15.853
I would be able to say.

13:15.853 --> 13:19.440
They are giving me a lot
of support, a lot of leeway--

13:19.440 --> 13:20.439
A lot of rope.

13:22.306 --> 13:24.226
No. That's not
what this is.

13:24.226 --> 13:26.451
Holly,
this is your last option.

13:26.664 --> 13:27.958
What--what if it doesn't work?

13:27.958 --> 13:29.694
What if this wine
is not the success

13:29.694 --> 13:31.063
That you need it to be?
No, it's gonna be.

13:31.063 --> 13:33.763
And if you weren't missing
the festival tomorrow,

13:33.763 --> 13:35.084
You would see that.

13:37.519 --> 13:39.515
All right. Well, you better
bring home a medal.

13:41.064 --> 13:42.195
You know I will.

13:44.175 --> 13:45.383
Okay, what are we doing
with Diane--

13:45.383 --> 13:47.942
5'7", 116 pounds,
mixed race?

13:47.942 --> 13:49.190
Oh, put her
on the short list.

13:49.190 --> 13:51.789
She's 5'7".
No, not short in height.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.601
Like, you know,
top five, top ten.
I-I know what you meant.

13:54.601 --> 13:55.239
Could you pass
the mint chip, please?

13:55.529 --> 13:57.977
Uh, we finished it.

13:58.949 --> 14:00.403
Okay,
we need to stop eating.

14:00.403 --> 14:02.035
We need to get out
of this apartment.

14:02.035 --> 14:04.667
We can't.
We have another 76 to go.

14:05.392 --> 14:06.823
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Wait. Look.

14:06.823 --> 14:08.847
Diane's never been
on a team before.
So?

14:09.319 --> 14:11.524
So what if she's a genius
with social issues?

14:12.200 --> 14:12.704
What good is it

14:12.704 --> 14:13.701
Being the smartest kid
on the playground

14:13.701 --> 14:16.170
If you have no friends?
Oh.

14:16.170 --> 14:19.209
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I can't do this anymore.

14:19.209 --> 14:21.946
I mean, this is...
This is weird.

14:21.946 --> 14:24.206
Most couples, they just--
they just do it

14:24.206 --> 14:27.188
And they get what they get.
Yeah, after marrying someone
they've considered carefully.

14:27.188 --> 14:30.937
Well, you know what?
In different circumstances,

14:30.937 --> 14:31.065
I would happily marry
any one of these women.

14:31.065 --> 14:32.132
I'm just trying
to give our kid

14:32.132 --> 14:33.424
The most advantages possible.

14:36.915 --> 14:37.971
Is this
what it's gonna be like?

14:37.971 --> 14:39.405
What?
When we have an actual child.

14:39.405 --> 14:41.454
When is good
gonna be good enough?

14:41.454 --> 14:43.527
How many hours are you gonna
make them practice piano

14:43.527 --> 14:45.170
Or do their
multiplication tables?
What about you?

14:45.170 --> 14:47.517
They're gonna have a hard time
writing their college essay,

14:47.517 --> 14:49.500
You know, are you just
gonna say, "oh, forget it.

14:49.500 --> 14:52.491
It's too hard. Let it go"?
Okay, I'm getting
some fresh air.

14:52.491 --> 14:53.857
That's my point.
You just walk away.

14:56.019 --> 14:58.528
Oh, can you at least bring back
some mint chocolate chip?

15:12.863 --> 15:15.706
Hey. Please tell me
you're on your way home.
I'm sorry.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.688
I think I'm gonna
have to pull an all-nighter.

15:17.881 --> 15:20.074
I don't know if I can go to
your festival tomorrow either.

15:21.306 --> 15:24.094
I can't believe this.
Look, if you're stressed
about the festival,

15:24.094 --> 15:26.981
It's gonna be fine.
No, justin, I am not
stressed out about the festival.

15:27.304 --> 15:30.139
Okay. Then what is it?
I don't want to talk about it
on the phone.

15:30.139 --> 15:31.207
That's why I wanted you
to come home tonight.

15:31.207 --> 15:33.064
You know what? You're making it
sound as if I want to be here.

15:33.064 --> 15:34.885
This sucks.
You have no idea.

15:34.953 --> 15:37.452
Rebecca, if this is about work,
I'm sorry.

15:37.452 --> 15:38.943
But I can't take on your stress, too.

15:37.942 --> 15:38.942
I'm not asking you
to take on my stress.

15:38.943 --> 15:41.207
All I've ever asked you to do
is just show up occasionally.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.691
Well, you're gonna have to
give that up for a while,

15:42.691 --> 15:43.770
Because you're gonna be
disappointed.

15:43.770 --> 15:45.287
Okay, you know what?
I-I give up.

15:45.287 --> 15:46.363
Let me know
when you can fit me in.

15:48.185 --> 15:49.273
Of course.

15:53.849 --> 15:54.625
Hi.

15:55.996 --> 15:56.886
<i>Salut, ma chÃ©rie.</i>

15:57.202 --> 15:58.542
Oh, there you are.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.431
Oh, how's it going?

16:00.845 --> 16:02.634
It's coming.
Can I see it?

16:02.634 --> 16:06.157
No.
Come on. It's due tomorrow.

16:06.250 --> 16:06.914
Yeah.

16:07.619 --> 16:09.953
Oh, my god.
You finished the whole bottle?

16:10.021 --> 16:12.522
Well, to make a label,
you need to know the wine.

16:12.590 --> 16:14.458
Well--
by the way, it's delicious.

16:14.525 --> 16:16.660
I'm glad you liked it.

16:16.728 --> 16:19.730
Can I at least see
what you've done so far?

16:19.797 --> 16:21.531
It's not ready.

16:21.599 --> 16:23.500
Look,
I-I just want to see it,

16:23.568 --> 16:25.902
Even if it's not
completely ready.

16:25.970 --> 16:30.240
All right. Like I said...
it's not ready.

16:30.308 --> 16:34.211
Oh, wow.
These are great.

16:34.278 --> 16:37.080
This one? Perfect.

16:37.148 --> 16:39.282
it--it's not finished, Sarah.

16:39.350 --> 16:41.718
Now I know you have
incredibly high standards.

16:41.786 --> 16:43.453
Yeah, you're right. I do.

16:43.521 --> 16:45.355
Trust me. I know.
This is good.

16:45.423 --> 16:47.090
You're just insecure.

16:47.158 --> 16:49.960
Insecure? I am insecure?

16:50.028 --> 16:51.962
You think you know
everything, don't you--

16:52.030 --> 16:54.865
When the painting is done,
if it's good enough...

16:54.932 --> 16:56.767
The way I feel?

16:56.834 --> 16:58.735
Here. It's yours.
Luc--

16:58.803 --> 17:00.537
Have fun with it.

17:00.605 --> 17:03.206
I'm going.

17:11.512 --> 17:13.031
It reminds me of when I had

17:13.031 --> 17:15.720
Backstage passes
at a beatles' concert.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.583
Wow.
You saw the beatles, huh?

17:18.538 --> 17:21.726
Well, I-I don't remember much.
I was very young.

17:23.209 --> 17:26.144
Um, so I told you, I--I'm going
to really have to move around

17:26.212 --> 17:28.046
And schmooze
all around here today.

17:28.114 --> 17:30.015
So why don't you
get some wine?

17:30.083 --> 17:32.451
And I'll meet you over
at the walker landing booth,

17:32.519 --> 17:35.120
Where-where-wherever it is.
Oh, hello.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.656
Oh, there's--um, she's--
she's a woman on the board.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.592
Now I-I-I told you.
I'm gonna have to work today.
Nora, I get it.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.794
Okay.
Work the room.
I'll catch you later.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.229
Yeah. O-okay. Jane.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.797
Hello, Nora.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.699
How are you?
Exciting about the wine.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.368
Yes.
Who was that?

17:49.435 --> 17:52.604
Who? Oh,
that handsome young man.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.374
Well, he's a doctor.
Simon Craig is his name.

17:55.441 --> 17:58.010
Oh, is Sarah dating him?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.646
No. Sarah is dating
a french artist, actually.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.748
Oh, right.
The one who did the label.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.317
Ah, youth.
They have all the fun.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.419
What's the point of living,
huh, Jane?

18:09.230 --> 18:11.130
Excuse me.
I have to find my family.

18:13.691 --> 18:15.393
Oh, mom.
Yeah, hi.

18:15.393 --> 18:16.461
So... Scotty and I,

18:16.461 --> 18:18.622
We've narrowed our egg choices
to a top 20...

18:18.622 --> 18:20.900
All of which are
unbelievably strong contenders.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.865
Well, you make it
sound like a reality show.

18:22.865 --> 18:24.431
Yeah, well, I don't want
to trivialize it

18:24.431 --> 18:25.175
Or make a mistake,

18:25.175 --> 18:27.743
And Scotty seems to have washed
his hands of the whole thing.

18:27.743 --> 18:32.266
<i>So I would like you
to meet Kimberly.
Hi, I'm Kimberly.</i>

18:32.266 --> 18:34.735
<i>I like to travel
and exercise...
"I like to travel
and exercise."</i>

18:34.735 --> 18:36.079
Cute, right?
Yeah.

18:36.079 --> 18:38.309
"I'm very driven,
and in the next five years,

18:38.309 --> 18:40.248
"I hope to complete
my j.D.M.B.A.,

18:40.248 --> 18:41.572
"after which, I'd like to open

18:41.572 --> 18:45.172
My own storefront
legal aid clinic."
you memorized her?

18:45.172 --> 18:46.736
Oh, yeah.
I've memorized all of them.

18:46.736 --> 18:47.682
My only problem with Kimberly

18:47.682 --> 18:50.108
Is her grandfather
had a stroke when he was 40,

18:50.108 --> 18:52.852
But she is 21,
so strong selling point.

18:52.852 --> 18:55.158
You know, some people think
women are like wine.

18:55.158 --> 18:57.757
They get better with age.
Not the fertility clinics.

18:57.757 --> 19:00.209
They tell you not to even
consider anyone over 25.

19:00.209 --> 19:01.771
All right, all right.
I know that.

19:01.771 --> 19:03.824
Look, kevin, I-I just don't
feel like I want to make

19:03.824 --> 19:05.875
An important decision like this
over wine.

19:06.419 --> 19:08.542
Why not? It's never stopped
our family before.

19:08.542 --> 19:11.114
You know,
get yourself a glass, Kevin.

19:11.114 --> 19:12.102
You look naked.

19:12.764 --> 19:14.766
Here we go. Here we go.

19:14.766 --> 19:17.089
I think you'll find this
a little more fruit forward,

19:17.089 --> 19:21.330
Not as much structure in it.
Hey, Rebecca.

19:21.330 --> 19:22.935
Can I have two more bottles
of wine, please?

19:23.974 --> 19:24.795
Rebecca.

19:25.130 --> 19:26.557
Yeah.
Can I have
two more bottles?

19:26.557 --> 19:29.952
Oh, sorry. Um, I didn't get
much sleep last night.

19:32.417 --> 19:34.471
Okay, I'll make you a deal--
I'll send you a case

19:34.471 --> 19:36.426
Of our pinot
over to your hotel

19:36.426 --> 19:38.284
If you'll consider us
for your wine list.

19:38.284 --> 19:40.585
Come on. 'cause you know we've
always wanted a crack at it.

19:41.812 --> 19:43.480
Luc. You came.

19:43.946 --> 19:45.375
Of course I come.

19:45.375 --> 19:48.171
Uh, uh, Jeffrey,
this is Luc Laurent.

19:48.171 --> 19:49.845
Luc is from bordeaux.
Hi.

19:49.845 --> 19:51.505
hi. Nice to meet you.
And he's been doing
some work for us.

19:51.505 --> 19:54.646
Actually, he did our label
for our new coastal reserve.

19:54.646 --> 19:57.230
It's great.
Right?

19:57.230 --> 19:59.044
Yeah, it really--
it really pops.
Thank you.

19:59.044 --> 19:59.954
See? I told you
it was great.

20:01.348 --> 20:04.061
Jeffrey's group owns some
beautiful boutique hotels.

20:04.061 --> 20:07.171
I bet you're always looking
for hot, new graphic designers.

20:07.171 --> 20:09.897
Sure--
logos, stationery, soap.

20:10.611 --> 20:11.753
Soap.
Yeah.

20:12.067 --> 20:13.881
Yeah.
Well, you know,
it's just a--just a start.

20:13.881 --> 20:16.464
Seriously, Jeffrey, he is
amazing. He can do anything.

20:16.464 --> 20:18.209
Sarah, I don't mean
to interrupt.

20:18.209 --> 20:19.197
I need to talk to you.
Okay.

20:19.197 --> 20:20.484
Excuse me.
Would you excuse me?

20:21.695 --> 20:22.505
Oh, did I tell you?

20:22.505 --> 20:24.529
He turned the label around
in one day.

20:25.261 --> 20:26.699
come on. Listen...
Amazing. Okay.

20:27.831 --> 20:28.977
She's a good agent.

20:28.977 --> 20:31.344
Trouble is, I thought
she was my girlfriend.

20:33.086 --> 20:34.985
Are you looking
for your doctor friend?

20:35.708 --> 20:39.487
Because he is over there
talking to my daughter.

20:39.852 --> 20:42.418
So what's the story?
Is he married, gay?

20:43.513 --> 20:45.034
Definitely not either.

20:45.034 --> 20:47.667
Good, 'cause I think they're
really hitting it off.

20:47.667 --> 20:50.754
Don't you?
They're talking, Jane.

20:50.754 --> 20:54.453
That's how
these things start, Nora.

20:54.453 --> 20:57.450
Now I know it's--
it's been a while,

20:57.736 --> 21:01.527
But I'm telling you,
I'm sensing chemistry.

21:03.952 --> 21:07.953
Well, your senses
are off, jane, way off,

21:07.953 --> 21:10.947
Because he's completely
in love with me.

21:12.029 --> 21:13.333
What?

21:13.333 --> 21:15.695
it's been
a few weeks now,

21:15.695 --> 21:17.172
And the attention's great,

21:17.172 --> 21:18.988
But it is getting to be
a bit much.

21:18.988 --> 21:21.079
I mean, I'm just glad
he's finally mingling

21:21.079 --> 21:23.391
So that I can have some space.

21:23.391 --> 21:25.166
oh, gosh.

21:26.856 --> 21:28.654
I do have my concerns.

21:28.654 --> 21:31.698
As you so aptly pointed out,
he's somewhat younger,

21:31.698 --> 21:33.992
But let me tell you,
that does have its advantages.

21:33.992 --> 21:37.561
And I will refrain from
describing to you in public--

21:37.561 --> 21:40.872
Oh, Jane, oh, Jane, oh, Jane.

21:42.118 --> 21:43.295
Then it does have
its downside.

21:43.295 --> 21:44.370
He's a bit immature.

21:44.370 --> 21:47.094
You remember what
40-something guys were like.

21:47.094 --> 21:48.751
Oh, oh, maybe you don't.

21:48.751 --> 21:50.661
Your husband is
quite a bit older, isn't he?

21:50.661 --> 21:53.625
I hope you're not
too disappointed about Lucy.

21:53.625 --> 21:56.674
I'm sure she'll snag
some guy one day soon.

21:56.674 --> 21:58.712
And, you know, when I
break it off with him,

21:58.712 --> 22:00.697
I'll make sure he has
her phone number.

22:00.697 --> 22:04.837
How's that?
Hey, gorgeous. You mind if
I steal my lovely lady away?

22:04.837 --> 22:06.237
Um, I...
Great.

22:07.515 --> 22:08.273
Thank you, Jane.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.669
Immature--
that's the problem?

22:12.669 --> 22:15.527
Oh, god. I'm sorry.
I just, you know--

22:15.527 --> 22:16.712
You were amazing.
I was?

22:16.712 --> 22:18.685
See, in boxing terms,

22:18.685 --> 22:20.611
We'd call that
a technical knockout.

22:20.611 --> 22:22.806
Did I say I wanted
to design a soap?

22:22.806 --> 22:24.919
I guess
I just don't understand.

22:24.919 --> 22:27.939
What's wrong with getting money
for doing something you love?

22:27.939 --> 22:31.982
I love painting, Sarah.
It's enough for me.

22:31.982 --> 22:33.860
I just don't understand why
it is not enough for you.

22:34.349 --> 22:36.075
Well, it's not enough
for the I.N.S.

22:36.075 --> 22:38.184
There's so many different way
to have a visa

22:38.184 --> 22:40.497
Than actually designing soaps.
Is there?

22:40.497 --> 22:41.557
Yeah.
Like what?

22:42.519 --> 22:44.180
I mean, have you even
looked into it?

22:44.180 --> 22:45.611
Because from what I'm hearing,

22:45.611 --> 22:47.386
They're not exactly
giving them away anymore.

22:47.386 --> 22:49.289
Why do you need to know this
right now?

22:49.289 --> 22:50.696
Because I need to know
what this is.

22:52.393 --> 22:53.693
What are we, Luc?

22:54.038 --> 22:56.047
Sarah, you always try
to label everything--

22:56.047 --> 22:57.443
Us, wine, soaps.

22:57.922 --> 22:59.777
Yeah, I guess that's what
grown-ups do.

22:59.982 --> 23:01.676
That's how we know
something's real.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.820
I'm under a lot of pressure
right now, luc.

23:04.820 --> 23:07.113
My family's business
could go under any day.

23:08.930 --> 23:12.169
And I need to know
if I really have a partner.

23:13.603 --> 23:16.124
I flew 6,000 miles
to be with you, Sarah.

23:16.124 --> 23:18.572
You asked me to help you
with the label. I did.

23:18.572 --> 23:20.597
I do laundry,
help with the kids.

23:20.597 --> 23:23.375
If anything ever go wrong,
I will be there for you.

23:23.375 --> 23:26.504
Yes, but--
but what, Sarah?

23:26.504 --> 23:28.585
Is it the money, the problem?
I don't make enough for you?

23:28.585 --> 23:31.710
No, no.
My art sells really well
in France.

23:32.766 --> 23:35.090
And if I stay here with you,
it will sell here, too.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.106
I know where this is going.

23:39.106 --> 23:40.831
I've been down
this road before--

23:40.831 --> 23:43.801
Feeling like I'm the only one
taking responsibility.

23:44.681 --> 23:46.477
C-can't you just be happy?

23:48.528 --> 23:50.116
It just sounds so naive.

23:52.093 --> 23:53.658
Well, to me,
that sounds cynical.

23:55.099 --> 23:56.321
Well... Luc, wait.

23:56.356 --> 23:59.068
You know, have a great time
in the festival.

23:59.068 --> 24:01.605
You know, and I-I hope the wine
does well. I-I really do.

24:02.148 --> 24:05.165
Luc? Come on, you...

24:14.462 --> 24:16.429
First of all,
I'd just like to say that

24:16.429 --> 24:17.809
All of the judges here today

24:17.809 --> 24:19.745
Were very impressed
with this class.

24:19.745 --> 24:22.110
We had a hard time judging,

24:22.110 --> 24:25.299
Which, for us,
isn't usually the case.

24:25.299 --> 24:27.584
Anyhow, without further ado,

24:27.584 --> 24:30.157
The top prize
for the table wine class--

24:30.157 --> 24:34.313
It's the coastal reserve
from walker landing.

24:34.313 --> 24:36.014
Oh, my--
oh, my god.

24:36.014 --> 24:37.429
you knew it.
You called it.

24:37.429 --> 24:38.739
Congratulations.

24:38.739 --> 24:39.512
Congratulations.
Oh--

24:39.512 --> 24:40.510
This is Simon?

24:42.465 --> 24:44.490
This is Simon.
Hey, Simon.

24:44.490 --> 24:47.602
Look! He put a little medal.
Sarah! Sarah, come here.

24:47.812 --> 24:49.238
We won!
What?

24:49.238 --> 24:52.039
We won! We won!
This is unbelievable!

24:52.039 --> 24:56.520
It's amazing.
Oh, my god.
I can't believe it.

25:02.198 --> 25:04.225
Okay, Nora, Nora, get in here.
You know, no.

25:04.225 --> 25:05.437
Come on. Just get in.
Come on, mom.

25:05.437 --> 25:08.345
Everyone a bit closer.
Come on, come on.

25:08.345 --> 25:11.743
You on the end, little, uh,
closer to your mom, please.

25:15.133 --> 25:16.287
Okay. Everyone, say cheese.

25:28.332 --> 25:29.184
That's very nice.

25:29.746 --> 25:31.191
All right, now that
you're officially

25:31.191 --> 25:32.614
The greatest judge
in the world,

25:32.614 --> 25:33.299
Take a look at these.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.794
Tell us which one
should be our egg donor.
What am I looking at?

25:35.794 --> 25:38.253
Caitlin. Strong grades,
but more of an athlete.

25:38.253 --> 25:40.656
Runs marathons.
Wins marathons.

25:40.656 --> 25:41.964
Probably not gonna give us
an Einstein,

25:41.964 --> 25:44.981
But, you know, more of
a socialized, popular kid.
Health okay?

25:44.981 --> 25:48.104
Absolutely. They don't make it
on to the list unless it's okay.

25:48.104 --> 25:50.486
Look, kevin, I know there's
a lot of pressure on you guys.

25:51.229 --> 25:53.062
And I certainly understand
as well as anyone

25:53.062 --> 25:55.143
That there was a day
in your life when it hit you

25:55.143 --> 25:58.382
That you would probably
never raise a family, right?
Right.

25:58.382 --> 26:00.488
But now you're both
gonna be dads.

26:01.489 --> 26:03.750
And you want it to be right.
You want it to be perfect.

26:03.750 --> 26:06.351
Well, close would be fine.
Yes.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.661
You know that wine of ours
that just won?

26:09.661 --> 26:10.407
Of course.

26:10.407 --> 26:12.306
It shouldn't have been
that good.

26:12.306 --> 26:13.941
Those grapes
were nothing special.

26:14.135 --> 26:17.186
But it is fantastic.

26:18.226 --> 26:20.302
And that's what I love so much
about making wine--

26:20.862 --> 26:24.246
The surprise when you get
much more than you put in.

26:25.019 --> 26:27.146
They tell me that parenting
is very much like that--

26:27.146 --> 26:30.290
Seeing your child
turn into something

26:30.290 --> 26:32.060
That you would never
have predicted.

26:33.244 --> 26:35.094
And now if you'll excuse me,

26:35.094 --> 26:37.382
I am going to taste
a cabernet sauvignon

26:37.382 --> 26:38.919
That I hear
great things about.

26:47.923 --> 26:48.670
Here you are.

26:49.515 --> 26:50.663
Yes, I'm cheating.

26:50.663 --> 26:51.954
I'm drinking the competition.

26:52.843 --> 26:53.834
The hell with it.

26:56.108 --> 26:56.976
You okay?

26:57.259 --> 26:58.559
No.

26:58.559 --> 26:59.696
I'm not okay.

27:00.288 --> 27:01.733
Is this about
that stupid photographer?

27:03.619 --> 27:05.492
It's about the photographer
and Jane

27:05.492 --> 27:07.490
And my brother
and my children.

27:07.490 --> 27:09.621
What--what are you
talking about?

27:09.621 --> 27:11.645
What am I--you know
what I'm talking about.

27:11.645 --> 27:13.232
It's the first thing
people see

27:13.232 --> 27:14.375
Whenever they look at us
together.

27:14.375 --> 27:18.985
You're in your 40s,
and I'm... Obviously not.

27:18.985 --> 27:20.031
I thought you didn't care.

27:20.031 --> 27:23.246
Well, I do care.
Why are you with me?

27:23.246 --> 27:25.096
You could be with anyone.

27:25.096 --> 27:28.284
You're a gorgeous, straight
40-year-old doctor

27:28.284 --> 27:29.317
Who travels the world.

27:29.317 --> 27:30.053
47.

27:30.053 --> 27:32.155
Well,
that changes everything.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.387
Nora, you're right.

27:34.387 --> 27:36.705
There's obviously
an age difference.

27:37.281 --> 27:39.644
Yes, I am a doctor.
I travel to some insane places.

27:39.644 --> 27:42.798
But that's because
I live my life--

27:42.798 --> 27:45.170
Without any rules,
way outside the box.

27:45.170 --> 27:48.709
No. The way I want to.

27:48.709 --> 27:51.611
You're a beautiful, smart,
passionate woman.

27:51.611 --> 27:52.921
That is why I'm with you.

27:54.814 --> 27:56.615
And this doesn't bother you?

27:56.615 --> 27:57.849
No.

27:58.203 --> 28:00.504
You know, the only thing
that troubles me

28:00.504 --> 28:01.794
Is your address.

28:01.794 --> 28:02.954
My address?

28:02.954 --> 28:05.754
You lived your whole life
in pasadena.

28:06.665 --> 28:07.975
You play it safe.

28:09.897 --> 28:10.773
That's the only thing
that's telling me to question

28:10.773 --> 28:11.766
Anything about us.

28:13.511 --> 28:14.900
Well, this is--
this is crazy.

28:14.900 --> 28:18.304
We--we are in completely
different stages of our lives.

28:18.304 --> 28:21.291
I have five grown children,
four grandchildren.

28:21.291 --> 28:23.020
You've never even
been married.

28:24.748 --> 28:27.739
Okay. Well, I'm sorry
I invited myself here.

28:27.739 --> 28:29.728
You didn't invite yourself.
I invited you.

28:29.728 --> 28:33.640
No. You didn't want me here.
You wanted to play it safe.

28:41.137 --> 28:42.245
I just thought
maybe you'd want to know

28:42.245 --> 28:44.065
Why Holly didn't accept
your offer to buy her out.

28:44.065 --> 28:46.226
Holly thinks this is what's
gonna turn ojai around,

28:46.920 --> 28:48.954
This, uh, coastal reserve?

28:48.954 --> 28:52.137
Yeah, they think it's gonna be,
like, a huge hit for them.

28:52.137 --> 28:55.704
This wine does real business,
I'll never have a shot at ojai.

28:55.704 --> 28:57.850
Seeing as how you stand
to benefit nicely

28:57.850 --> 28:58.838
If I get this company,

28:58.838 --> 28:59.952
I think you should be
thinking about

28:59.952 --> 29:01.344
How to help fix
the situation.

29:13.601 --> 29:14.144
Hey.

29:14.144 --> 29:14.642
Hey.

29:14.642 --> 29:16.895
I am so proud of you guys.

29:16.895 --> 29:19.544
Your mom is practically
singing show tunes,

29:19.544 --> 29:21.171
She's so happy.
Oh, thanks.

29:22.047 --> 29:23.615
What--what did Justin say?

29:23.615 --> 29:25.874
Um, I'm not supposed to
bother him when he's studying.

29:28.023 --> 29:29.962
What's going on, Bec?
Nothing.

29:31.094 --> 29:32.486
Oh, no, come on.
You gotta talk to me.

29:32.486 --> 29:33.310
What's wrong?

29:38.165 --> 29:39.370
I'm pregnant.

29:40.650 --> 29:42.307
Oh, s-sweetie.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.040
Yeah, six weeks.

29:46.288 --> 29:47.809
Oh... God.

29:48.065 --> 29:49.345
I haven't told anybody yet.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.199
What about Justin?

29:52.199 --> 29:53.716
Are you kidding me?
I've tried.

29:54.776 --> 29:56.419
You know what? It's probably
better that I haven't.

29:56.638 --> 29:58.603
What does that mean?
He's already told me
he doesn't want a baby.

29:58.887 --> 30:02.089
Obviously that was before
you knew you were pregnant.

30:03.598 --> 30:04.674
What do you want?

30:05.877 --> 30:07.309
I don't know.

30:09.418 --> 30:11.586
Well, you have to
figure that out.

30:12.453 --> 30:16.025
I will support you,
whatever--whatever you decide.

30:16.532 --> 30:17.675
I'm gonna be there for you.

30:17.675 --> 30:21.707
But when you do...
Then you have to talk to him.

30:21.771 --> 30:22.709
I know.

30:33.967 --> 30:35.335
I can't believe my ride

30:35.413 --> 30:37.836
Drove off into the sunset
on his motorcycle.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.582
I can't believe you turned up
to the wine festival

30:40.582 --> 30:42.765
On a motorcycle in that dress.

30:42.765 --> 30:43.594
Oh!

30:43.837 --> 30:45.263
It wasn't easy,

30:45.263 --> 30:47.684
And apparently not enough
to impress the doctor,

30:47.684 --> 30:49.076
Who says I live in a box

30:49.076 --> 30:51.672
Because I'm a little hung up
about the age difference.

30:51.672 --> 30:54.884
A lot hung up, mom.
Well, it's embarrassing.

30:54.884 --> 30:56.980
Why?
I-I don't know. I mean--

30:56.980 --> 30:59.439
I mean, who am I kidding?
Who the hell do I think I am?

30:59.439 --> 31:01.809
I feel like one of those
old ladies with botox

31:01.809 --> 31:04.307
Trying to stuff myself
into a pair of skinny jeans.

31:04.307 --> 31:08.519
or it's like dating
some undocumented french guy.

31:08.777 --> 31:10.749
No, it's not.
It's not anything like that.

31:10.749 --> 31:13.457
I don't know, mom.
You know what?

31:13.457 --> 31:14.847
If I'm really honest
with myself,

31:14.847 --> 31:17.881
I think maybe I'd be
less anxious and better off

31:17.881 --> 31:21.450
With a regular guy who has
a regular paycheck and a visa.

31:22.036 --> 31:23.005
You know, I really,

31:23.005 --> 31:24.971
I pushed him
on that wine label.

31:24.971 --> 31:28.521
Now I feel like a pushy,
corporate dream dasher

31:28.521 --> 31:29.538
All over again.

31:29.538 --> 31:31.408
It's like dÃ©jÃ  vu.

31:31.408 --> 31:33.123
Luc is not Joe.

31:33.123 --> 31:36.021
He's at the opposite end
of the men spectrum.

31:36.021 --> 31:38.552
Luc is--is kind and happy,

31:38.552 --> 31:40.159
And he's not trying to be
someone he isn't.

31:40.159 --> 31:43.888
No, I know. Don't get me wrong.
I mean, he's adorable.

31:43.888 --> 31:44.911
He's a great guy.

31:44.911 --> 31:47.067
But the main thing is,
he showed up there,

31:47.067 --> 31:48.391
Even though you bullied him
about the label.

31:48.391 --> 31:50.958
See? I bullied him.
I hate that.

31:50.958 --> 31:52.750
And a lot of guys
would not have done that,

31:52.750 --> 31:55.636
Including joe, who would've
stayed home and sulked.

31:55.636 --> 31:58.076
But your boyfriend came there
to show you his support

31:58.076 --> 32:01.137
Because he... Must love you
or like you a lot.

32:01.137 --> 32:03.647
More importantly,
I think he likes himself.

32:03.647 --> 32:04.340
And you know what?

32:04.340 --> 32:07.396
Finding someone like that is
the holy grail of relationships.

32:11.180 --> 32:12.323
I'm an idiot.

32:12.710 --> 32:14.963
You know what? Simon's an idiot.
I don't live in a box.

32:15.499 --> 32:16.431
Tell him.

32:18.498 --> 32:19.878
Tell him.

32:25.342 --> 32:26.374
All right. I will.

32:33.385 --> 32:33.992
What are you doing?

32:33.992 --> 32:36.100
S--I'm sorry.
Look. I'm s--I'm sorry.

32:36.100 --> 32:39.685
I... Look, I've--I've put
all the finalists up.

32:39.685 --> 32:41.143
I thought maybe we could
throw darts at them.

32:41.143 --> 32:44.064
I don't think throwing darts
at women's faces is a good idea.

32:44.064 --> 32:46.530
You were right.
You were absolutely right.

32:46.598 --> 32:48.565
Any one of them
would be great.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.701
So please pick a dart.

32:50.769 --> 32:53.203
Wait. Is this a joke
or does your o.C.D.

32:53.271 --> 32:55.407
Actually run on some sort
of fuel that you're out of?

32:55.407 --> 32:56.846
No. I just realized

32:56.846 --> 32:58.653
That the way I've been
approaching this...

32:58.653 --> 33:01.945
It's as if caitlin here
wins marathons

33:02.013 --> 33:03.547
Because she has long legs.

33:03.615 --> 33:06.550
Whereas really, at mile 22,
when everyone else is dropping,

33:06.618 --> 33:09.219
She digs deeper
because someone in her life

33:09.287 --> 33:11.288
Taught her
never to give up--

33:11.356 --> 33:13.757
Set an example,
made her that way.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.960
Caitlin--any of those girls--
they'll give us a healthy baby.

33:17.028 --> 33:19.396
Who that child
turns out to be...

33:19.464 --> 33:21.365
Is up to us.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.267
That's what I'm excited about,

33:23.335 --> 33:27.004
Because I can't wait to see
the result of us being dads.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.607
Me neither.

33:32.210 --> 33:33.610
On three?

33:33.678 --> 33:34.545
Yeah.

33:34.612 --> 33:36.347
One...

33:36.414 --> 33:38.782
Two... Three.

33:41.052 --> 33:43.220
Maybe we should roll dice.

33:43.288 --> 33:44.369
Yeah.
Yeah.

33:46.620 --> 33:47.168
Nora

33:47.168 --> 33:48.730
Come here. I want to show you
something.

33:51.023 --> 33:51.892
Now let's see.

33:52.263 --> 33:54.685
One, two, three, four, five.
Right here.

33:54.685 --> 33:56.382
This is the step
where my son Justin

33:56.382 --> 33:58.935
Split his head open when he was
wasted out of his mind.

33:58.935 --> 34:00.813
And--and out there
is the swimming pool

34:00.813 --> 34:02.760
Where my husband drowned
on my daughter's birthday.

34:02.760 --> 34:04.463
Up there
in the very first bedroom

34:04.463 --> 34:06.526
Is where I'm nursing Kitty
through chemo.

34:06.526 --> 34:08.228
It's the very same bedroom
that Sarah stayed in

34:08.228 --> 34:10.141
When she was going through
her divorce.

34:10.141 --> 34:11.286
And in there
is the living room

34:11.286 --> 34:14.045
Where my son Kevin
married his partner Scotty.

34:14.045 --> 34:16.693
So this is the box I live in.

34:16.693 --> 34:19.466
It's not med school, but it's
not playing it safe either.

34:20.199 --> 34:21.868
I shouldn't have said it
like that.

34:24.150 --> 34:26.659
I am hung up
about our age difference.

34:28.251 --> 34:30.639
you remind me
of my husband.

34:31.187 --> 34:32.223
Uh-oh.
No.

34:33.632 --> 34:34.737
No, in a good way.

34:34.806 --> 34:37.907
You're... You're charming
and exciting

34:37.907 --> 34:39.185
And unpredictable,

34:39.185 --> 34:40.208
Just like he was.

34:40.208 --> 34:43.550
The difference is, he didn't
take me along for the ride.

34:45.629 --> 34:47.797
And I find it hard to believe
you want to.

34:51.054 --> 34:52.523
I do.

35:02.700 --> 35:05.024
Do you feel like
everyone's watching us?

35:07.972 --> 35:09.807
Yes.

35:09.874 --> 35:11.875
Let them watch.

35:20.184 --> 35:21.488
Holly.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.641
Jennifer Knox
from the "wine spectator"

35:23.641 --> 35:26.048
Wants to do a feature
on our coastal reserve...

35:26.048 --> 35:27.865
For the next issue.
How about that?

35:27.865 --> 35:30.684
Well, apparently,
I have calls to return

35:30.684 --> 35:32.229
From "food & wine"...
Yes.

35:32.297 --> 35:33.893
And "bon appetit."

35:33.893 --> 35:36.248
That's wonderful. I have to say,
Holly, we're indebted to you.

35:36.714 --> 35:38.041
You know, when a company
goes through

35:38.041 --> 35:39.448
The kind of crises
we've been through,

35:39.448 --> 35:41.918
It's very easy to hunker down
and stick to core values.

35:41.918 --> 35:44.764
But what's really needed
is an open mind, new ideas.

35:45.585 --> 35:46.721
And that's what you did.

35:47.084 --> 35:48.640
And that's why ojai
is gonna prosper.

35:49.114 --> 35:51.824
And next time, I will have
your back from the get-go.

35:53.915 --> 35:54.928
Holly Harper.

35:57.696 --> 35:59.362
I'm sorry. What?

36:03.928 --> 36:06.096
How could this
have happened? Oh.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.765
Oh, my god.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.501
Oh.

36:10.568 --> 36:12.469
Holly, wh--

36:16.975 --> 36:21.111
That's all there is, Saul.

36:21.179 --> 36:23.981
There's nothing left.

36:29.754 --> 36:33.657
<i>I'm just making
petit dejeuner.</i>

36:33.725 --> 36:34.691
Hey.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.629
What's with the bag?

36:38.696 --> 36:41.365
I'm going home, Sarah.

36:41.432 --> 36:43.433
Oh, come on.

36:43.501 --> 36:45.836
Listen, yesterday,
I-I wanted to...

36:45.904 --> 36:47.838
Talk to you last night, but--

36:47.906 --> 36:49.773
You and I can go on for years,

36:49.841 --> 36:52.242
Pretending the difference
between us is not important,

36:52.310 --> 36:53.710
But it is.

36:53.778 --> 36:56.547
No, no. Listen, listen.

36:56.614 --> 37:01.585
I have a lot of baggage
from my lousy marriage.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.620
But, um, I'm gonna shed it.

37:03.688 --> 37:06.290
I mean,
consider it shed.

37:06.357 --> 37:08.725
Maybe I had to go through
this whole, uh, label debacle--

37:08.793 --> 37:10.827
This is not about the label.

37:10.895 --> 37:12.596
Since I got here,
you've been asking me,

37:12.664 --> 37:14.865
What's my plan and all.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.733
Oh, I know.
And you don't have one.

37:16.801 --> 37:18.635
And that's okay with me now.

37:18.703 --> 37:21.371
And it's, uh...

37:21.439 --> 37:24.474
It's not easy for me to...
Let life unfold,

37:24.542 --> 37:27.611
But... I'm gonna try
to do that.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.646
That's easy for you to say.

37:29.714 --> 37:32.516
No, it's not, actually.

37:36.287 --> 37:38.021
I love you, Luc.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.426
I love you, too, Sarah.

37:44.362 --> 37:46.964
So put the bag down.

37:47.031 --> 37:49.933
I don't want us
to start hating each other.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.703
Oh, my god.
You're breaking up with me.

37:54.072 --> 37:56.273
Oh, I can't believe
this is happening.

37:56.341 --> 37:58.275
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

37:58.343 --> 37:59.776
No, I'm...

38:01.879 --> 38:03.380
My taxi. Um...

38:03.448 --> 38:05.349
Here, this is for paige
and coop.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.819
Thank you.

38:33.411 --> 38:35.162
Hey.

38:35.162 --> 38:36.801
Hey.

38:38.394 --> 38:41.890
Oh. I am gonna sleep
until January.

38:42.684 --> 38:43.872
How was it?

38:44.823 --> 38:46.023
Oh, I'll tell you one thing,

38:46.090 --> 38:48.110
There was a lot
of spinal cord on there.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.162
How was the, uh,
how was the festival?

38:51.162 --> 38:52.895
Oh, it was good. We won.
You won?

38:52.895 --> 38:55.838
Yeah.
That's great. That must
make you feel better.

38:56.403 --> 38:58.568
Yeah, yeah. Um--

38:58.636 --> 39:00.637
Hey, look,
I-I just want to say,

39:00.705 --> 39:01.904
I'm sorry
for going a.W.O.L. On you.

39:02.585 --> 39:03.126
Justin--

39:03.126 --> 39:04.955
No, no, I know I flaked
on a lot of things

39:04.955 --> 39:06.830
For a lot of lame reasons,
but this is different.

39:07.547 --> 39:09.980
Rebecca, I need to be
totally committed

39:09.980 --> 39:11.305
If I'm gonna
pull through this.

39:11.305 --> 39:14.584
And...
There are gonna be times

39:14.652 --> 39:16.409
Where I'm not
gonna be there for you.

39:17.458 --> 39:20.223
You know, I--I'm trying to learn
all this stuff at the same time,

39:20.291 --> 39:23.026
And it becomes too much.

39:23.094 --> 39:26.196
You... You understand that,
right?

39:26.264 --> 39:30.233
Yeah. D-definitely.

39:30.301 --> 39:32.002
Okay.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.460
Now I've been eating

39:33.460 --> 39:34.965
Vending machine food
for three days.

39:34.965 --> 39:37.327
So I think I'm gonna go
make myself something real.

39:37.327 --> 39:38.805
You want anything?

39:38.805 --> 39:41.498
No, I'm good. Thanks.

39:53.688 --> 39:55.950
Hey, I'm home!

40:01.551 --> 40:02.878
I'm sorry I'm late.
There was a lot of turbulence.

40:02.878 --> 40:04.499
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Uh, um...

40:04.499 --> 40:05.279
Um...

40:05.079 --> 40:16.216
Hey.
Hi.

40:18.216 --> 40:21.785
A-aren't you
gonna say anything?

40:21.853 --> 40:24.721
Yeah. It's good to be home.

40:26.891 --> 40:28.658
No, no, Robert, Robert,
I...

40:28.726 --> 40:30.627
I don't have any hair.

40:30.695 --> 40:32.829
I know.

40:38.703 --> 40:41.404
No, I'm--I'm bald.

40:43.407 --> 40:45.242
And beautiful.

40:45.309 --> 40:47.344
You mean, you're...

40:47.411 --> 40:50.280
You're not gonna run
screaming the other way?

40:50.348 --> 40:52.816
No.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.451
Well, because I...

40:54.519 --> 40:57.020
I thought that maybe it was
all about the wig,

40:57.088 --> 40:59.956
And--and I-I don't want it
to be about the wig.

41:00.024 --> 41:03.059
I want it to be about me,
and I-

41:04.529 --> 41:06.596
I love you

41:06.664 --> 41:10.300
<i>For reasons that have
