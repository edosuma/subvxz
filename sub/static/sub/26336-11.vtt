WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:03.103
Previously on Hawaii Five-O...

00:03.103 --> 00:04.671
JOE:
Where the hell have you been?
You're in danger.

00:04.671 --> 00:05.939
STEVE:
I just figured that out.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.174
JOE: I take it someone
just paid you a visit.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.942
Someone's trying to take out
the Morocco team.

00:08.942 --> 00:11.144
They're using professional
hitters to do it.

00:11.144 --> 00:12.279
STEVE:
I know it was you, Greer.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.647
It had to be.
Nobody else knew about it.

00:13.647 --> 00:14.748
It was a black op.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.483
You can't outrun
these people forever.

00:16.483 --> 00:19.386
Who paid for these hits?
Someone who doesn't
like you, Steve.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.221
TANI: Good news. We found
your hitter from this morning.

00:21.221 --> 00:24.157
He gave us the name of
a lawyer from Denmark

00:24.157 --> 00:26.827
who set everything up
for his very rich client.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.362
What's his name?

00:28.362 --> 00:31.298
We ID'd that client.
His name is Omar Hassan.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.333
Omar Hassan is the son
of the high-value target

00:33.333 --> 00:37.404
we took out on that operation
in Rabat, 2002.

00:37.404 --> 00:38.772
He's about ten years old now.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.274
Greer escaped.
What?

00:40.274 --> 00:41.842
Adam's with the California
authorities now.

00:41.842 --> 00:42.976
They're trying to find her.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.311
JOE:
Steve, Steve.

00:44.311 --> 00:46.647
I couldn't be prouder

00:46.647 --> 00:48.415
of the man you've become.

00:48.415 --> 00:50.651
We're gonna get him, Joe.
You know that, right?

00:50.651 --> 00:52.786
Of that I have no doubt.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.660
(birds chirping)

01:12.839 --> 01:14.775
(vehicle approaching)

01:40.467 --> 01:42.169
(car door closes)

01:46.373 --> 01:46.707
Hey.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.008
Hay is, uh, for horses.

01:49.242 --> 01:52.079
You didn't need
to come out here.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.680
Oh, no. No,
I did, you see,

01:53.680 --> 01:56.116
because, uh, that's
what family does.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.884
That's, uh,

01:57.884 --> 02:00.253
that's some real wisdom, Danny.

02:00.253 --> 02:01.922
Well, I g-- I got that
from you, you know?

02:01.922 --> 02:03.323
When my brother died,
you wouldn't leave me alone.

02:03.323 --> 02:05.692
Big pain in the ass, so...

02:05.692 --> 02:07.327
I'm glad to see you.

02:09.863 --> 02:12.566
So, what do you say?
It's been over a month.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.401
Ready to come home now or what?
(door opens)

02:17.070 --> 02:18.839
(door closes)
Uh-huh.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.975
Hey.

02:21.975 --> 02:26.446
I didn't, ah, you know,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

02:26.446 --> 02:29.683
What exactly did you, uh,
think you were interrupting?

02:29.683 --> 02:31.151
I don't know.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.252
The, uh, grieving process?

02:32.252 --> 02:34.054
That's not what this is.

02:42.062 --> 02:44.698
DANNY: Well, I liked it better
when I thought you two

02:44.698 --> 02:46.533
were playing house. Who's that?

02:46.533 --> 02:50.070
This is Gregers Thomsen.
He's Omar Hassan's lawyer.

02:50.070 --> 02:51.538
Huh.

02:51.538 --> 02:52.906
If you say so.
I mean, it looks to me

02:52.906 --> 02:54.007
like his mother
couldn't recognize him.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.242
STEVE:
It was Greer who gave up

02:55.242 --> 02:56.643
the name of the
SEALs on the mission

02:56.643 --> 02:59.413
that killed Hassan's father
in '02.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.014
(clatters)

03:01.014 --> 03:04.985
But it was Gregers here
who executed Hassan's plan.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.153
Isn't that right, Gregers?

03:07.320 --> 03:09.022
CATHERINE:
He hired the hitters

03:09.022 --> 03:10.991
who murdered the team.

03:10.991 --> 03:12.325
(quietly):
Including Joe.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.528
You're just in time, Danny.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.964
Gregers was, uh, just about
to tell us Hassan's location.

03:17.964 --> 03:20.367
Isn't that right?

03:20.367 --> 03:24.638
Yeah. Doesn't-doesn't seem to me
like he's gonna talk.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.740
That's okay.
I'm not done with him yet.

03:38.852 --> 03:42.089
(Hawaii Five-O
theme song playing)

04:09.950 --> 04:12.819
I got 175. 175.
Can I get 200?

04:12.819 --> 04:15.088
200, anybody?
200. 200 over there.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.758
How about 225? 225? Anyone?

04:17.758 --> 04:21.394
225? 225, anybody? 2... 225.

04:21.394 --> 04:22.295
250.

04:22.295 --> 04:23.763
Bryan, chill.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.298
You got to speculate
to accumulate.

04:25.298 --> 04:26.500
Can I get 260?
Anyone?

04:26.500 --> 04:30.237
260? 260? I got 250 going once,

04:30.237 --> 04:31.872
250 going twice.

04:33.039 --> 04:34.374
Sold for $250.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.176
Yes.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.911
Let's save the high-fives
until we've seen

04:37.911 --> 04:39.012
what the hell we bought.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.422
If we'd paid 20 bucks for this,
I'd feel ripped off.

04:49.422 --> 04:50.891
We haven't checked out
these boxes yet.

04:50.891 --> 04:54.628
Uh, treasure comes in all shapes
and sizes, brother.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.830
Got some books here. Boring.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.865
Some stuff...

04:58.865 --> 05:02.035
DVD collection.
This is more like it.

05:05.739 --> 05:08.341
How much you think
we can get for this?

05:08.341 --> 05:10.777
Is it Blu-ray?
No.

05:10.777 --> 05:12.679
Maybe 50 cents?

05:25.959 --> 05:27.060
What is it?

05:28.595 --> 05:29.963
Dude.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.401
(phone ringing)

05:34.401 --> 05:35.702
CUNHA:
Medical examiner's office.

05:35.702 --> 05:37.671
This is Dr. Noelani Cunha
speaking.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.806
Noelani? You don't know me,
but my name's Bryan Lee.

05:39.806 --> 05:42.976
I got your number from
my cousin Sadie Yoshida.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.477
Oh, Yoshy!

05:44.477 --> 05:46.846
Yeah, sure.
Um, how can I help you?

05:46.846 --> 05:49.716
Me and my brother just bought
this storage locker at auction.

05:49.716 --> 05:51.384
We were hoping
for something valuable.

05:51.384 --> 05:54.287
Oh, like Storage Wars? Ah, did
you guys find anything exciting?

05:54.287 --> 05:58.291
Actually, um, I think
we found human bones.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.827
I'm texting you a picture now.

06:00.827 --> 06:02.996
(phone chimes)

06:05.632 --> 06:07.801
Yeah, I got it.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.803
We didn't want to waste
the police's time if this is

06:09.803 --> 06:12.005
one of those med school
skeletons

06:12.005 --> 06:14.941
or, you know,
some collector's item?

06:14.941 --> 06:16.643
Uh, no, uh,
you did the right thing.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.545
Bryan, this is
what I need you to do:

06:18.545 --> 06:20.914
Text me the address and the
locker number and wait for me.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.749
And in the meantime,
don't touch anything.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.499
Bryan?

06:40.867 --> 06:42.802
Bryan!

06:47.741 --> 06:49.676
(line ringing)
(phone ringing)

07:00.186 --> 07:02.188
Oh, my God.

07:20.707 --> 07:23.176
You, uh, you done?

07:23.176 --> 07:25.078
With that?
Because, uh, taking in

07:25.078 --> 07:27.147
this fresh mountain air
is a little difficult

07:27.147 --> 07:28.248
with the screaming and crying.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.554
Hassan's in Vientiane, Laos.

07:34.554 --> 07:38.058
Nice, uh, nice work. So y-you
just tell somebody at the CIA,

07:38.058 --> 07:39.559
and then-then they do
what they got to do,

07:39.559 --> 07:41.594
and problem solved, right?

07:43.263 --> 07:45.332
Oh, what, what-what
are you-- you want to go

07:45.332 --> 07:47.967
to Laos-- we-- you want me to go
to Laos? Is that what that is?

07:47.967 --> 07:50.270
Us-- we are going to Laos.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.105
That... uh,
it's 10,000 miles away,

07:52.105 --> 07:53.506
and I assume
that this guy

07:53.506 --> 07:56.876
has, like, a real security team,
like a, a good one, right?

07:56.876 --> 07:58.445
And-and there's three of us,

07:58.445 --> 08:01.081
and I don't even have
a passport, so I can't go.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.882
Oh, no, we're not
flying commercial.

08:02.882 --> 08:05.085
No, there's gonna be
more than three of us.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.542
Thanks for coming.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.211
Teams. Hoo-yah?

08:31.211 --> 08:33.546
Hoo-yah.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.615
Lieutenant Rollins.
Junior.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.617
Look, this mission is gonna
get down and dirty.

08:37.617 --> 08:40.987
So, uh, no more of this
Ms. Rollins-ing me

08:40.987 --> 08:42.622
one more second, okay?

08:42.622 --> 08:43.790
All right.
All right.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.458
Copy that. Catherine?

08:45.458 --> 08:47.394
There you go.
Yeah.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.363
What up, man?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.232
This isn't even
a starting five.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.200
We couldn't enter
a basketball tournament

08:54.200 --> 08:55.735
with this sorry bunch.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.171
STEVE:
Here comes your power forward.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.808
DANNY:
Wade Gutches? Seriously?

09:01.808 --> 09:03.643
He's the AARP poster boy.

09:03.643 --> 09:07.080
Maybe he retired a while back,
but that guy's still got game.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.993
(grunts)

09:25.198 --> 09:28.001
STEVE:
Gutch.

09:31.337 --> 09:33.273
(exhales)

09:33.273 --> 09:34.607
Good to see you, man.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.509
Likewise, buddy.

09:36.509 --> 09:39.045
Thanks for coming, man.

09:39.045 --> 09:40.747
Rollins. Get in here.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.148
Mmm.

09:43.283 --> 09:46.519
(grunts)
Thanks for showing up.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.154
We appreciate it.

09:48.154 --> 09:49.656
Good to see you, Gutch.

09:49.656 --> 09:50.824
GUTCHES:
Danny.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.493
Long time no see.
Yeah, man.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.795
Junior Reigns,
I'd like you to meet somebody.

09:55.795 --> 09:58.531
This is one of Joe's old
friends, Commander Wade Gutches.

09:58.531 --> 09:59.799
Nice to meet you, Junior.

09:59.799 --> 10:02.535
Actually, I already know you
by reputation, sir.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.937
Yeah?
Junior was in the teams

10:03.937 --> 10:05.271
until recently.
He's, uh,

10:05.271 --> 10:07.273
he's now a part of Five-O.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.477
Well, you sure landed
on your feet there, son.

10:10.477 --> 10:11.911
STEVE:
Hey, Gutch,

10:11.911 --> 10:14.414
talk to you for a minute?

10:17.016 --> 10:18.618
All due respect,

10:18.618 --> 10:20.520
it's been a minute for you.
I just, uh...

10:21.788 --> 10:23.623
You gonna be okay with all this?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.391
Guess we'll find out, won't we?

10:25.391 --> 10:28.294
Tell you one thing,

10:28.294 --> 10:29.729
what we're doing--

10:29.729 --> 10:32.065
going after the bastard
that killed Joe,

10:32.065 --> 10:33.800
putting him in the ground--

10:33.800 --> 10:35.735
that's about the only thing
that could've pulled me

10:35.735 --> 10:38.104
out of retirement.

10:38.104 --> 10:39.839
LUCIA: You people
gonna chitchat all day,

10:39.839 --> 10:41.407
or do you want
to get airborne?

10:41.407 --> 10:45.979
Commanders, this bird
is fueled up and ready to fly.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.580
Copy that, Lucia.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.215
Thank you.
We'll be right there.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.283
Who is that?

10:50.283 --> 10:52.585
That's Frank Bama's daughter.

10:52.585 --> 10:55.455
She's a-- she's a real
chip off the old block.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.323
Is that a good thing?

10:57.323 --> 10:59.425
STEVE:
All right, let's go, guys.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.361
("Frankenstein" by Edgar Winter
playing)

11:09.035 --> 11:11.471
Look, I know it's hard,

11:11.471 --> 11:13.940
but you start worrying about
McGarrett and the boys,

11:13.940 --> 11:15.842
it's not gonna help
the situation one bit.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.944
We all need to focus
our energies on something

11:17.944 --> 11:19.279
that is actually going
to make a difference.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.881
TANI: Right. Like this case.
GROVER: Damn right.

11:21.881 --> 11:23.283
How's our girl?

11:23.283 --> 11:24.717
She didn't know
the victims personally,

11:24.717 --> 11:26.052
but it's still
a lot to deal with.

11:26.052 --> 11:27.420
What do we got here?

11:27.420 --> 11:29.188
Well, Noelani gets
a call from our vics

11:29.188 --> 11:30.990
saying they've just won
the contents of this locker

11:30.990 --> 11:32.692
at auction and discovered
what they believed

11:32.692 --> 11:34.761
to be human bones inside.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.529
But, when she gets down here,
she finds the two brothers,

11:36.529 --> 11:40.400
Bryan and Ben Lee, shot dead
and no sign of any bones.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.535
So, clearly, someone
wanted to make sure

11:42.535 --> 11:44.070
these bones weren't
discovered.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.306
Yes. And when they were,
our perp was willing

11:46.306 --> 11:48.207
to drop two bodies

11:48.207 --> 11:50.009
to keep his or
her secret safe.

11:50.009 --> 11:52.145
All right, well, then,
our primary suspect

11:52.145 --> 11:53.680
has to be whoever was
renting this locker

11:53.680 --> 11:55.848
before it was auctioned off.

11:55.848 --> 11:57.684
TANI: Sure, that makes
sense, but, you know,

11:57.684 --> 12:00.053
if I had a storage unit
filled with human remains,

12:00.053 --> 12:01.721
I would, uh,
put a good effort into

12:01.721 --> 12:03.189
making sure that rent
was paid.

12:03.189 --> 12:04.757
Sure, you would,
but that's why I'm thinking

12:04.757 --> 12:06.125
that whoever was renting
this locker

12:06.125 --> 12:08.061
found out too late
it was being auctioned.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.597
So, when they get down here,
they got no choice,

12:10.597 --> 12:12.899
they have to improvise.
Sorry to disappoint,

12:12.899 --> 12:14.601
but I ran the name
on the contract,

12:14.601 --> 12:15.935
and it's an alias.

12:15.935 --> 12:18.371
Rent was prepaid
with cash for a year

12:18.371 --> 12:19.505
before the money ran out.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.975
Okay. All right,
so we don't have a name.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.143
But we do have all
this stuff inside here.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.646
So let's roll up our sleeves
and go

12:26.646 --> 12:28.248
through all this junk, because
it's the best opportunity

12:28.248 --> 12:30.416
we have at IDing our killer.
Come on.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.418
But watch out for the blood.

12:34.287 --> 12:38.424
GUTCHES: So we pull this HVT
out of the field.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.126
The guy's a bomb maker
for al-Qaeda.

12:40.126 --> 12:43.096
This crazy bastard decides
he's gonna make a bolt for it.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.697
Throws himself out of the helo.

12:44.697 --> 12:48.101
Splash! Joe just didn't
want to see whatever

12:48.101 --> 12:50.336
intel this guy might have

12:50.336 --> 12:52.872
go to the bottom
of the Arabian Gulf.

12:52.872 --> 12:56.376
So he unbuckles and jumps
right out after him.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.945
Joe makes his way
over to this guy.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.114
By this time, the guy's...
(fades out)

13:08.888 --> 13:12.859
This was the best
bad decision

13:12.859 --> 13:14.394
I've made in a long time.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.196
Why was it a bad decision?
It wasn't a bad decision.

13:17.196 --> 13:19.599
It was, um...

13:19.599 --> 13:22.301
stress relief is what it was,
I think.
(chuckles)

13:22.301 --> 13:25.738
Mm. So it was just
therapy, really.

13:25.738 --> 13:26.739
Yeah.
Nothing more.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.474
Just two people
using each other

13:28.474 --> 13:30.977
for their own
selfish purposes.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.012
Very selfish purposes.
(laughs)

13:33.012 --> 13:34.947
You know, it would
be good to have

13:34.947 --> 13:37.116
this kind of therapy
available to me again

13:37.116 --> 13:38.317
if I needed it.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.153
Can I please finish
my chow mein?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.088
I'm trying to get a little
more fuel in the body here.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.424
Yeah, I was talking
about the future future.

13:44.424 --> 13:47.260
Go on, Agent Greer.

13:48.594 --> 13:51.898
You know, someone
with your experience

13:51.898 --> 13:54.400
would do really well
in the Agency.
In the CIA?

13:54.400 --> 13:57.637
I don't think I'm, uh...
(laughs)

13:57.637 --> 13:59.672
I-I ain't CIA material.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.909
Well, you can't be
a SEAL forever.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.977
And if you did join, who knows?

14:04.977 --> 14:08.047
We could end up being stationed
in the same city.

14:08.047 --> 14:11.551
If we were stationed
in the same city,

14:11.551 --> 14:13.686
we could have very
regular therapy, right?

14:13.686 --> 14:16.189
Yeah. Exactly.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.590
You done with those noodles?

14:17.590 --> 14:19.859
Yeah, I'm done
with these noodles.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.498
LUCIA: Ladies and gentlemen,
we're on our final approach,

14:25.498 --> 14:27.100
so get ready to cross them
and toss them,

14:27.100 --> 14:28.501
'cause according
to satellite weather,

14:28.501 --> 14:30.670
it's gonna be a bumpy landing.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.905
Hey.

14:32.905 --> 14:34.040
What?

14:34.040 --> 14:35.875
Where'd you just go?

14:38.778 --> 14:41.547
I don't know,
I'm just, uh...

14:41.547 --> 14:44.450
I'm just thinking we're
doing all this stuff

14:44.450 --> 14:47.220
to get this guy, Hassan,
and for good reason.

14:49.856 --> 14:53.059
But at the end of the day,
I get it...

14:53.059 --> 14:55.495
I-I totally get it.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.396
I understand why
he did what he did.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.731
He's avenging
his father's death.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.199
I would have done
the same thing.

15:00.199 --> 15:02.835
But he wouldn't have
been able to do that

15:02.835 --> 15:04.003
if it wasn't for Greer.

15:04.003 --> 15:06.739
Greer's the one who
sold out her country,

15:06.739 --> 15:08.608
who turned on her people.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.577
We'll find her.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.112
Hassan worked with Greer.

15:13.112 --> 15:15.181
He might be able to tell us
what rock she's under.

15:15.181 --> 15:19.418
But if he can't, then
we just keep looking.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.220
And we keep looking until.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.456
Okay, we owe Joe that much.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.258
Yeah.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.527
And I'm in this with you
until the end.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.461
Okay?

15:40.473 --> 15:41.908
ADAM:
Okay, so according to Noelani,

15:41.908 --> 15:43.910
there were recurring prints
on a number of these items.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.311
Same individual,

15:45.311 --> 15:47.513
but unfortunately
no match in the system.

15:47.513 --> 15:48.648
And then there's this.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.017
These are high school

15:51.017 --> 15:54.453
love letters, also found
in the storage locker.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.889
All written by the same person
approximately 20 years ago.

15:56.889 --> 15:57.990
Apparently,

15:57.990 --> 15:59.659
this is how people
used to communicate

15:59.659 --> 16:01.294
before Instagram and texting.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.228
How did people hook up?

16:02.228 --> 16:04.463
I don't know, it seems
like a lot of work to me.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.199
Not everything that's new
is better, you know.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.501
Here we go. He's gonna tell us
about the good old days.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.336
Actually, I'm with Lou
on this one.

16:10.336 --> 16:13.039
I still remember getting
love letters in high school.

16:13.039 --> 16:14.140
Of course you do.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.108
Look at you, that face,
those dimples.

16:16.108 --> 16:18.010
I'd have been all over that
in ninth grade.

16:18.010 --> 16:20.346
I can't tell--
is she messing with me, Lou?

16:20.346 --> 16:21.747
Who knows?

16:21.747 --> 16:24.750
The point I'm making here
is that it took time

16:24.750 --> 16:28.354
to compose these letters
and then go mail them off.

16:28.354 --> 16:30.289
They meant something,
and that's why the guy

16:30.289 --> 16:31.657
kept them all these years.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.860
So, you're saying our killer's
a romantic at heart?

16:33.860 --> 16:36.128
You want to get back
to the case?
All right, well,

16:36.128 --> 16:37.496
I read the whole bunch.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.966
Now, our sender
only refers to this guy

16:39.966 --> 16:41.367
by a nickname: Woody.

16:41.367 --> 16:43.703
Now, there's no addresses
on the letters,

16:43.703 --> 16:45.271
but judging
by their arrangements

16:45.271 --> 16:46.806
they made to meet up,

16:46.806 --> 16:48.341
it looks like they lived
pretty close to each other.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.775
Right, but since none
of the letters

16:49.775 --> 16:51.344
were saved in their envelopes,

16:51.344 --> 16:53.379
we don't have the address
of either party.

16:53.379 --> 16:54.680
Correct.
And then there's this.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.483
So, she never signs off
with her name,

16:57.483 --> 16:59.685
only this lipstick kiss
at the end of it.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.621
You see?
That's right.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.624
That's what young ladies
used to use before emojis.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.025
And I'll tell you
something else.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.960
It was a hell of a
lot more wholesome

17:07.960 --> 17:10.863
than the things that
your generation uses now,

17:10.863 --> 17:12.231
with the eggplants and peaches.

17:12.231 --> 17:14.200
Oh, God...
I don't even want
to know what else.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.203
Okay, all right.
Yes. Sure. Um, anyway,

17:17.203 --> 17:20.606
I, uh, asked Noelani to
run the lipstick for DNA.

17:20.606 --> 17:23.743
We got a hit.
Carol Bucklee.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.746
She is in the system,
unfortunately, because

17:26.746 --> 17:28.447
she died in a car accident
five years ago.

17:28.447 --> 17:31.183
I was able to get
an address from her records,

17:31.183 --> 17:32.919
and it looks like
she grew up here:

17:32.919 --> 17:34.353
Canton, Ohio.

17:34.353 --> 17:35.755
GROVER: All right, this is good,
but we're gonna need

17:35.755 --> 17:37.356
a lot more than this
if we're gonna catch up

17:37.356 --> 17:38.958
with the mysterious Woody.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.826
Wait a minute, pull up
the bowling trophy again.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.897
Try a search for

17:44.897 --> 17:46.432
"Last Pin bowling alley,
Canton, Ohio."

17:48.668 --> 17:50.403
GROVER:
There it is.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.904
If our killer was
on a championship team,

17:51.904 --> 17:54.574
chances are there's
a record somewhere.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.842
I'll reach out
and see what I can find.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.778
(woman singing
in foreign language)

18:04.083 --> 18:06.919
LANGFORD:
A word of warning.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.689
The cocktails here are terrible.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.624
I'll just have a beer.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.361
Got any other local tips?

18:15.361 --> 18:16.829
As a matter
of fact, I have.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.432
I've secured us
a conveniently, um,

18:19.432 --> 18:22.835
located safe house,

18:22.835 --> 18:24.770
identified Hassan's
contact in the city,

18:24.770 --> 18:26.706
won $150,000 at craps,

18:26.706 --> 18:30.543
and, and I met a lovely local
woman called Vatsana.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.546
You have been busy.
Um...

18:33.546 --> 18:35.047
What'd you learn
about our friend?

18:35.047 --> 18:36.582
Pulled a few favors

18:36.582 --> 18:38.851
with some friends
in the intel community,

18:38.851 --> 18:41.420
and I was able to trace
an $8 million wire

18:41.420 --> 18:43.122
that Hassan made a week ago

18:43.122 --> 18:46.959
to Vientiane's Mandarin Club.

18:46.959 --> 18:50.029
It's a, uh, exclusive,
members-only establishment.

18:50.029 --> 18:52.698
They have a high roller
game room.

18:52.698 --> 18:54.433
It attracts some big hitters.

18:54.433 --> 18:57.036
So, what are you thinking,
that transfer was, uh,

18:57.036 --> 18:58.637
some kind of
money-laundering play?

18:58.637 --> 19:00.873
That's right, and I was able
to make a few friends,

19:00.873 --> 19:02.208
and with their help,

19:02.208 --> 19:05.678
worked out exactly how Hassan
is accessing his cash.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.847
For the past few evenings,
Hassan's runner,

19:07.847 --> 19:09.348
a chap named Dimitri, comes in

19:09.348 --> 19:11.350
and makes a large withdrawal
of chips from the cashier.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.886
About a million at a time.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.855
He then spends about an hour
at the table,

19:15.855 --> 19:17.790
always losing around 100 grand.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.326
100 grand is ten percent.
It's got to be the vig, right?

19:20.326 --> 19:22.695
The club's fee
for watching the money.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.797
That was my thinking.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.899
And once he has his money,
he doesn't hang around.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.602
Always a rolling-car pickup,
decoy vehicles.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.404
A smart operation.
(wand whines)

19:31.404 --> 19:34.573
Probably run by someone
who used to be Agency.

19:34.573 --> 19:36.075
We assume he's been
doing this every night

19:36.075 --> 19:37.243
since the money wire.

19:37.243 --> 19:38.978
Tonight could be
our last night to track him.

19:38.978 --> 19:42.081
I conveniently overheard him
tell the dealer last night

19:42.081 --> 19:44.984
that he would be
at the club again tonight.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.886
So will we.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.321
All right, well, if Harry's
intel is correct, then we know

19:49.321 --> 19:52.091
Hassan's runner Dimitri is gonna
be at that club tonight at 9:00.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.526
What we don't know is

19:53.526 --> 19:55.227
how many more shots
we're gonna get

19:55.227 --> 19:57.029
at tailing him back
to wherever Hassan is.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.998
Which means we got
to make tonight count.

19:58.998 --> 19:59.999
This Dimitri is a pro.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.268
He doesn't carry
a phone we can track.

20:02.268 --> 20:03.502
Always checking
his angles.

20:03.502 --> 20:05.771
I tried tailing him
on two previous evenings,

20:05.771 --> 20:07.506
and both times he lost me.

20:07.506 --> 20:09.942
Is that because he's very good,
or did you lose a step?

20:09.942 --> 20:11.844
Hardly. Dimitri has a tight
security detail with him.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.512
They know how
to run interference,

20:13.512 --> 20:14.780
throw you off a tail.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.782
Even if we run leapfrog
surveillance, taking turns

20:16.782 --> 20:18.651
to track him,
it'll be next to impossible

20:18.651 --> 20:19.919
to keep eyes on him.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.554
Well, if we can't
rely on maintaining

20:21.554 --> 20:22.988
visual contact, why
don't we just plant

20:22.988 --> 20:24.590
a tracker on
him or his car.

20:24.590 --> 20:27.059
We can, but... his driver
never leaves the vehicle,

20:27.059 --> 20:29.361
which they change mid-route
anyway, plus...

20:29.361 --> 20:32.231
he wants the car and Dimitri
before they head off,

20:32.231 --> 20:33.699
so, um, traditional
tracking devices

20:33.699 --> 20:35.701
are not going to cut it.

20:35.701 --> 20:37.870
So how are we gonna paint
the target?

20:37.870 --> 20:40.239
We have to find a way
to get this into his drink.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.974
This is
a radioactive solution.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.276
Once ingested, we can track him.

20:44.276 --> 20:45.678
Why? Is he gonna glow
in the dark?

20:45.678 --> 20:47.613
In a manner of speaking.
Catherine and I

20:47.613 --> 20:49.448
are gonna enter that club
at 2000 hours.

20:49.448 --> 20:51.550
We're gonna straight
to the high roller table.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.419
CATHERINE:
Wait. Hate to be that girl,

20:53.419 --> 20:56.288
but, um, I don't have
anything to wear.

20:56.288 --> 20:57.556
I took the liberty
of purchasing

20:57.556 --> 21:00.693
something suitable
earlier today.

21:00.693 --> 21:04.830
Oh, and, um, for the purposes
of this operation...

21:04.830 --> 21:07.700
you two... are married.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.970
GUTCHES:
Aw...

21:10.970 --> 21:12.304
isn't that sweet.

21:12.304 --> 21:13.272
Mazel tov.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.141
I do.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.142
What's next?

21:16.142 --> 21:17.576
Before you get cleaned up,

21:17.576 --> 21:21.280
I need to, uh, brief you
on the finer points of baccarat.

21:23.315 --> 21:25.985
("Like Sugar" by Chaka Khan
playing)

21:31.157 --> 21:33.259
♪ It's like su... ♪

21:35.995 --> 21:38.264
♪ It's like su... ♪

21:40.833 --> 21:45.471
♪ It's like sugar, so sweet... ♪

21:45.471 --> 21:48.774
Okay. We've hacked
into all external street

21:48.774 --> 21:50.943
and internal club CCTV.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.144
Good luck, everyone.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.179
And I have to say, Steve,

21:53.179 --> 21:54.847
you look absolutely magnificent

21:54.847 --> 21:55.714
in my tux.

21:55.714 --> 21:58.918
He's spoken for, cowboy.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.019
Kiss-ass.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.053
Dimitri pulled his chips.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.054
He's at the high roller table.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.423
Copy that.

22:11.363 --> 22:12.665
Good evening. Bonsoir.

22:12.665 --> 22:13.766
STEVE:
Bonsoir.
Madame.

22:18.370 --> 22:22.608
You're not gonna wait for the
divorce before you take half?

22:22.608 --> 22:24.944
Oh, don't be a
caveman, darling.

22:26.512 --> 22:29.848
Hey, uh, a vodka martini.
Actually...

22:29.848 --> 22:31.016
a beer, whatever,

22:31.016 --> 22:32.384
local beer, please.

22:32.384 --> 22:34.453
Blanton's, rocks.

22:34.453 --> 22:36.222
Uh, I'm actually gonna have
the same thing as him, please.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.757
Thank you.

22:40.292 --> 22:41.627
LANGFORD:
You're up, Gutches.

22:41.627 --> 22:42.561
GUTCHES:
Copy that.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.836
Right in here, son.

23:01.847 --> 23:02.948
(Steve sighs)

23:06.518 --> 23:08.754
CATHERINE:
Ouch. Tough beat.

23:12.291 --> 23:13.058
Hot streak, huh?

23:52.197 --> 23:53.499
Target just placed a big bet.

23:53.499 --> 23:54.600
Looks like he wants
to close this thing out.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.502
LANGFORD:
Everyone stay alert.

23:56.502 --> 23:58.070
He could be about
to make a move.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.772
He hasn't touched his drink.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.573
DANNY: I don't want
to state the obvious,

24:01.573 --> 24:02.775
but he leaves that
drink and we got

24:02.775 --> 24:03.976
zero chance of following him.

24:13.819 --> 24:14.853
Sorry.

24:20.693 --> 24:22.594
Okay, that's
his hundred K limit.

24:22.594 --> 24:23.862
If he follows pattern,

24:23.862 --> 24:25.297
he's gonna leave soon.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.131
McGarrett?

24:26.131 --> 24:27.132
Catherine?

24:27.132 --> 24:28.100
Better do something.

24:29.868 --> 24:32.271
Oh. Leaving so soon?

24:32.271 --> 24:33.839
Not my night.

24:33.839 --> 24:37.109
Oh. I was, um,

24:37.109 --> 24:39.611
I was really hoping
that we could, um,

24:39.611 --> 24:41.113
play a little longer.

24:41.113 --> 24:44.283
Oh, well. How about
a toast, then?

24:44.283 --> 24:46.518
To...

24:46.518 --> 24:47.953
knowing when to walk away.

24:58.764 --> 24:59.865
Cheers.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.940
Have a good evening.

25:10.442 --> 25:12.378
LANGFORD:
Nice save, Lieutenant.

25:14.246 --> 25:16.949
Dimitri just cashed in, Steve.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.283
Here we go.

25:18.283 --> 25:20.219
(mouths)

25:20.219 --> 25:22.020
(Catherine mouths)

25:33.532 --> 25:35.868
Dimitri's convoy is on the move.

25:43.675 --> 25:45.577
We have eyes on you, Steve.

25:45.577 --> 25:47.179
Please tell me
that thing is working,

25:47.179 --> 25:48.947
or this is gonna be the
shortest tail in history.

25:48.947 --> 25:51.483
It's working. I got him.

25:51.483 --> 25:52.584
We're good.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.253
He's heading for the underpass.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.755
We're gonna lose visual.
It's over to you guys.

25:56.755 --> 25:58.057
Let's hope that thing
keeps working.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.158
Still got him.

26:09.635 --> 26:11.036
CATHERINE:
Okay, guys. Dimitri just pulled

26:11.036 --> 26:13.372
into the lobby area of the
high rise across the street.

26:13.372 --> 26:17.009
Bringing up
local street CCTV now.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.277
He's heading
for the elevator.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.679
Guy's got quite
the fortress, huh?

26:20.679 --> 26:23.949
LANGFORD:
See if we can find out
what floor he's going to.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.419
28th floor.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.588
We just found Hassan.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.690
Okay. Tell us what
you see in there, please.

26:31.690 --> 26:32.891
We've got loads of cameras,
biometric entry system,

26:32.891 --> 26:35.627
two armed guards, I could go on.

26:35.627 --> 26:38.797
Well, suffice to say, Hassan
has done a bang-up job here.

26:38.797 --> 26:41.934
This place is gonna be
one hell of a nut to crack.

26:46.572 --> 26:48.474
So, I finally heard
back from Hal Walter,

26:48.474 --> 26:50.209
the owner of Last Pin bowling
alley in Canton, Ohio.

26:50.209 --> 26:51.510
Thankfully,

26:51.510 --> 26:54.880
Mr. Walter has photos of
every past championship team

26:54.880 --> 26:56.248
on display at the alley.

26:56.248 --> 26:58.317
Living on a Spare.

26:58.317 --> 26:59.885
2009 club champions.

26:59.885 --> 27:02.955
Hang on. Look at this guy
here on the right.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.890
Check out that ball.

27:04.890 --> 27:06.058
Same exact one

27:06.058 --> 27:08.026
we recovered from the locker.

27:08.026 --> 27:10.496
This is our guy.

27:10.496 --> 27:12.030
Alexander Woods.

27:12.030 --> 27:14.867
Well, no prizes for guessing
how he got the nickname Woody.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.001
So, our guy

27:16.001 --> 27:17.803
Woody goes from bowling
in Canton

27:17.803 --> 27:19.738
to storing bodies on Oahu.

27:19.738 --> 27:21.573
He got a local address?
ADAM:
Not a current one.

27:21.573 --> 27:23.709
According to public records,
he was renting an apartment

27:23.709 --> 27:26.378
in Waimea until 18 months ago,
July 2017.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.146
TANI:
That's the same month

27:28.146 --> 27:30.516
that the storage unit
was originally rented.

27:30.516 --> 27:31.750
Exactly. I called the landlord,

27:31.750 --> 27:33.952
and he says Woods
moved without any notice.

27:33.952 --> 27:35.254
Just left an envelope of cash

27:35.254 --> 27:36.889
paying off the rest
of his lease.

27:36.889 --> 27:38.557
After that,
he falls off the grid.

27:38.557 --> 27:40.158
No public records,

27:40.158 --> 27:42.761
no utilities in his name,
no anything.

27:42.761 --> 27:44.596
Hmm. Strange but not entirely
inconsistent with the behavior

27:44.596 --> 27:45.998
of a man who just killed a dude

27:45.998 --> 27:47.666
and then kept his bones
as a memento.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.168
GROVER: Or maybe we're getting
this whole thing wrong.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.570
Nobody ever vanishes, Adam.

27:51.570 --> 27:54.306
Maybe the reason
there are no recent records

27:54.306 --> 27:56.141
on Alexander Woods is because

27:56.141 --> 27:58.410
Alexander Woods
is no longer alive.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.445
Mr. Sayles.

28:00.445 --> 28:02.514
Ain't life funny?
Last week we'd have had to have

28:02.514 --> 28:04.116
this conversation
in Halawa Prison.

28:04.116 --> 28:06.351
Congratulations
on your release.

28:06.351 --> 28:10.355
According to your jacket, you
just wrapped a 12-month stint.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.457
A DUI, and as an added cherry,

28:12.457 --> 28:15.427
possession
of an unlicensed firearm.

28:15.427 --> 28:16.728
I've made mistakes.

28:16.728 --> 28:18.664
But that doesn't give you
the right to harass me.

28:18.664 --> 28:20.098
TANI:
Harass you?

28:20.098 --> 28:21.133
We just want to ask you
a couple questions.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.001
What about?

28:23.001 --> 28:24.670
Here's what about.

28:24.670 --> 28:27.139
Alexander Woods.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.408
You know, your
old partner

28:29.408 --> 28:32.110
from the bait and tackle
shop on the North Shore.

28:32.110 --> 28:34.012
Well, that was
a failing business.

28:34.012 --> 28:38.050
But just when you thought
you were about to lose your ass,

28:38.050 --> 28:40.352
pow, stroke of luck.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.120
Your partner disappears.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.122
And with him out of the picture,

28:44.122 --> 28:46.992
you liquidate all the inventory,
you shutter the business,

28:46.992 --> 28:50.562
and you actually recoup
most of what you put in.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.798
Knowing you,

28:52.798 --> 28:55.634
you're probably still holding
on to old Alex's share

28:55.634 --> 28:59.438
of that money, I mean, you know,
in case he comes back.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.974
He's the one that skipped town
and left me holding the bag.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.241
That didn't happen.

29:03.241 --> 29:06.878
Yeah, i-in fact,
we're a hundred percent certain

29:06.878 --> 29:08.614
that you killed Alexander Woods.

29:08.614 --> 29:10.248
(laughs)
Then you stuffed
his belongings

29:10.248 --> 29:13.085
and his body
into a storage locker,

29:13.085 --> 29:14.252
'cause you figured

29:14.252 --> 29:15.988
who's gonna miss a
guy with no family,

29:15.988 --> 29:17.422
no local ties?

29:17.422 --> 29:19.958
Everybody'd just assume
that he skipped town.

29:19.958 --> 29:21.760
But your luck ran out,
didn't it?

29:21.760 --> 29:23.195
Because a couple months later,

29:23.195 --> 29:25.430
you get busted,
you get thrown in Halawa

29:25.430 --> 29:26.765
and then,
all of a sudden,

29:26.765 --> 29:29.635
oh, my goodness,
you can't pay rent

29:29.635 --> 29:31.803
on the storage unit
that you rented.

29:31.803 --> 29:35.907
That must have been just
so stressful for you, right?

29:35.907 --> 29:38.276
Because the body was there.
It could've been discovered.

29:38.276 --> 29:39.478
Yeah, and by the time
you get out,

29:39.478 --> 29:41.480
that storage locker's
up for auction.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.181
So you had to improvise.

29:43.181 --> 29:45.083
You go kill two people

29:45.083 --> 29:47.486
and stuff two more dead
bodies in that locker.

29:47.486 --> 29:51.490
And then you skedaddle with
your old partner's remains.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.892
Because, well, if the police
ID those bones,

29:53.892 --> 29:56.428
well, that's gonna lead
everybody straight to you.

29:56.428 --> 29:58.263
You got any evidence?

29:58.263 --> 30:00.499
Ooh, he wants evidence.
Do we have evidence?

30:00.499 --> 30:02.134
How about the
credit card receipt

30:02.134 --> 30:03.335
for that boat you rented

30:03.335 --> 30:05.170
that you were out on
yesterday afternoon?

30:05.170 --> 30:06.538
The GPS

30:06.538 --> 30:08.306
from that boat, it tells us

30:08.306 --> 30:10.275
that it was actually
a short trip, wasn't it?

30:10.275 --> 30:13.245
Because you went out,
you anchored for 15 minutes,

30:13.245 --> 30:15.614
and then you returned it,
didn't you?

30:15.614 --> 30:16.782
What were you doing?

30:16.782 --> 30:19.151
Don't answer. We know.

30:19.151 --> 30:21.053
You know that the
Honolulu Police Department

30:21.053 --> 30:24.289
has a dive team?

30:27.993 --> 30:29.728
That's right, genius.

30:29.728 --> 30:31.063
And they went
diving yesterday

30:31.063 --> 30:34.399
and found that bag of bones
you dumped in the ocean.

30:34.399 --> 30:37.202
And if that ain't damning
enough, inside that bag

30:37.202 --> 30:40.672
they found a fragment of the
bullet that killed Woods.

30:40.672 --> 30:44.209
The lab is running
the ballistics right now.

30:44.209 --> 30:45.711
Here's a question.

30:45.711 --> 30:50.882
Tell me, what are the chances
that it matches

30:50.882 --> 30:53.952
the unlicensed gun
that you were busted for?

30:53.952 --> 30:57.155
So long, chump.

31:00.325 --> 31:03.328
(sighs)

31:03.328 --> 31:05.697
Is that enough evidence for you?

31:13.772 --> 31:15.474
How's it going?

31:15.474 --> 31:17.743
If this map is accurate,
then we actually have a bunch

31:17.743 --> 31:20.445
of options.
Infil and exfil spots.

31:20.445 --> 31:22.114
I mean, and look at this--
we got the whole other side,

31:22.114 --> 31:23.148
this entire flank.

31:24.316 --> 31:28.053
No, Steve, I mean,
how are you doing?

31:36.128 --> 31:37.763
Joe's death is my fault.

31:37.763 --> 31:39.131
No. Don't do that.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.999
You asked, I'm telling you.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.268
He took a bullet for me,
I couldn't save him.

31:43.268 --> 31:45.036
And had it been
the other way around,

31:45.036 --> 31:46.438
you would have taken
that bullet for him.

31:46.438 --> 31:50.876
That's what we do
for the people we love.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.544
It was Joe's
choice, okay?

31:52.544 --> 31:54.679
He wouldn't want you
feeling responsible.

31:54.679 --> 31:57.082
But the fact is, if it wasn't
for me, he wouldn't be dead.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.651
If I was able to see Greer
for the threat that she was,

31:59.651 --> 32:02.454
Joe wouldn't be dead, right?

32:02.454 --> 32:04.956
But I couldn't see that 'cause
I had a blind spot for her.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.230
Cath, there's something
you need to know.

32:12.230 --> 32:13.832
Before you and I started dating,

32:13.832 --> 32:14.766
Greer and I...
I know.

32:16.701 --> 32:18.170
I know.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.472
What do you know?

32:20.472 --> 32:22.974
Years ago,
I was at the Pentagon,

32:22.974 --> 32:24.242
doing an intel briefing.

32:24.242 --> 32:26.244
(sighs)

32:26.244 --> 32:28.046
Lieutenant Rollins.

32:28.046 --> 32:30.448
Listen, just so
this isn't awkward,

32:30.448 --> 32:32.050
I heard you're dating
Commander McGarrett.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.985
And I just want
you to know that

32:33.985 --> 32:35.720
I am really
happy for you.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.322
Thanks.

32:37.322 --> 32:38.623
One... (chuckles)

32:38.623 --> 32:40.091
piece of advice, though:

32:40.091 --> 32:42.527
you might want to temper
your expectations.

32:42.527 --> 32:44.162
As much as we all
want him to be,

32:44.162 --> 32:49.000
he's... just not the type
to ever settle down.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.635
STEVE:
You knew

32:50.635 --> 32:52.337
about me and Greer
all this time

32:52.337 --> 32:54.339
and you never
said anything?

32:54.339 --> 32:57.075
It was before
we started dating.

32:57.075 --> 33:00.245
And I didn't believe anything
she said about you anyway.

33:02.447 --> 33:04.115
All right, boys and girls,
this thing's a go.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.554
(typing)

33:16.528 --> 33:19.331
Okay, hacked the building
security system. I'm in.

33:20.799 --> 33:23.468
Waiting for people to clear.

33:23.468 --> 33:24.669
Recording the video loop.

33:24.669 --> 33:25.770
(laptop beeps)

33:25.770 --> 33:26.838
All right, got it.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.473
I'm ready whenever
you guys are.

33:28.473 --> 33:30.375
All right, Evel
Knievel, go ahead.

33:30.375 --> 33:31.509
Clever, Williams.

33:44.456 --> 33:45.924
Got to make
a delivery.

33:45.924 --> 33:47.192
I got to make a delivery.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.594
I got stuff back here.

33:49.594 --> 33:51.129
GUTCHES:
All clear.

33:51.129 --> 33:52.864
Your turn, Rollins.
Sending the video loop

33:52.864 --> 33:55.267
into the security system.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.434
Let's go.

34:05.844 --> 34:07.379
STEVE:
Go, go, go. Everybody go.

34:12.317 --> 34:14.185
Move. Go. Move.

34:16.621 --> 34:17.956
STEVE:
English?

34:17.956 --> 34:20.258
English? Yes, yes. 28, floor 28.

34:20.258 --> 34:21.793
28, 2-8, let's go.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.361
Good. Hands on the wall.

34:23.361 --> 34:24.663
Hands on the wall.
Don't move.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.531
(elevator bell dings)

34:26.531 --> 34:28.133
All right, back in a jiff.

34:28.133 --> 34:29.601
Jiffy?

34:29.601 --> 34:31.236
We got eight minutes,
that's all you got.

34:31.236 --> 34:33.004
Okay? "Jiffy."

34:33.004 --> 34:35.140
Hands behind
your back.
Come on.

34:37.142 --> 34:39.611
(groaning)

34:50.221 --> 34:51.323
(panting)

35:01.600 --> 35:02.734
(device beeps rapidly)

35:13.712 --> 35:15.880
(groans)

35:17.616 --> 35:18.750
(cries out)

35:28.026 --> 35:29.394
(groans)
(screams)

35:30.629 --> 35:32.364
STEVE: Put your hands
behind your head,

35:32.364 --> 35:34.199
interlock your fingers.
Do it, Commander.

35:34.199 --> 35:36.301
I avenged my father's death

35:36.301 --> 35:37.769
and I'm prepared to die.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.604
Inshallah.

35:39.604 --> 35:40.972
(grunts)

35:40.972 --> 35:42.774
STEVE: You avenged
your father's death?

35:42.774 --> 35:44.609
'Cause you murdered
five of the six SEALs

35:44.609 --> 35:46.778
that were on that raid,
but you missed the one.

35:46.778 --> 35:48.847
You missed the one
who took the shot

35:48.847 --> 35:50.615
that killed your father.

35:50.615 --> 35:53.818
That's right, you didn't know
that, did you?

35:53.818 --> 35:55.120
Well, that's a juicy piece
of irony.

35:57.022 --> 35:59.124
CATHERINE: Guys.
Go ahead, Catherine.

35:59.124 --> 36:00.291
We got a problem.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.203
You're gonna tell
your men to stand down.

36:12.203 --> 36:13.605
And give up the only leverage
I have here?

36:15.040 --> 36:17.575
I don't think so.

36:20.145 --> 36:21.880
Make the call.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.683
One thing I've learned
from my time in Vientiane:

36:24.683 --> 36:27.485
never leave home
without a backup plan.

36:27.485 --> 36:30.522
(phone beeps)
Vatsana.
It's Harry.

36:32.957 --> 36:34.859
(sirens approaching)

36:36.995 --> 36:38.663
DANNY: Oh, this is
gonna be interesting.

36:50.975 --> 36:53.745
Tell Harry Langford he owes me.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.080
DANNY: Um, I'm sure
he's gonna get

36:55.080 --> 36:56.681
right on that.
That-that was,

36:56.681 --> 36:58.183
that was fantastic,
thank you.

36:58.183 --> 37:00.118
All right, guys, we're all good.
All the hostiles

37:00.118 --> 37:02.854
are taken down.
There goes your leverage.

37:02.854 --> 37:04.422
You hear that?

37:04.422 --> 37:06.825
Don't make the same mistake
Commander White made

37:06.825 --> 37:08.426
when you people killed
my father.

37:08.426 --> 37:09.694
If you let me live,

37:09.694 --> 37:11.663
I promise...

37:11.663 --> 37:13.264
you'll regret it.

37:13.264 --> 37:15.533
Is that what you want?

37:15.533 --> 37:17.168
Is that what
you want for him?

37:17.168 --> 37:20.605
Why would you want that for him?

37:20.605 --> 37:23.007
So he can relive
the same cycle?

37:23.007 --> 37:24.843
All over again?
Do it!

37:27.145 --> 37:28.646
No.

37:30.215 --> 37:31.683
I want something
else out of you.

37:45.997 --> 37:47.031
(exhales)

37:48.133 --> 37:49.567
(door opens)

37:56.141 --> 37:59.611
It's good to see
you're hydrating.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.045
This, this,
uh, heat...

38:01.045 --> 38:02.647
really takes it
out of you, huh?

38:02.647 --> 38:04.883
CATHERINE:
I wouldn't do that.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.050
(sighs deeply)

38:08.620 --> 38:09.888
(Greer scoffs)

38:09.888 --> 38:12.724
Finally.
(breathes deeply)

38:12.724 --> 38:14.993
We're all together again.
Hmm.

38:14.993 --> 38:18.163
Yeah. But not for long.

38:18.163 --> 38:19.797
And after all
the good advice I gave you.

38:21.266 --> 38:22.901
Why don't you explain
something to me?

38:22.901 --> 38:24.169
Help me understand.

38:26.804 --> 38:28.273
You turn against
your country.

38:30.675 --> 38:33.344
You give up the names of men

38:33.344 --> 38:34.846
and women
that you've served with,

38:34.846 --> 38:36.314
knowing full well
they would die.

38:36.314 --> 38:37.515
What amount of money

38:37.515 --> 38:40.118
could have possibly made
that worth it?

38:40.118 --> 38:42.287
Maybe it wasn't just
about the money, Steve.

38:44.656 --> 38:48.126
Maybe there were...
other factors.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.060
Don't do it.

39:07.979 --> 39:09.881
STEVE:
Hey, Wade.

39:09.881 --> 39:12.116
Thanks for
everything, man.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.520
It was fun... mostly.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.555
My advice to you, though:

39:17.555 --> 39:19.791
find yourself a good woman,

39:19.791 --> 39:21.693
a boring hobby, and...

39:21.693 --> 39:23.861
first chance
you get, retire.

39:23.861 --> 39:25.196
(chuckles)

39:25.196 --> 39:27.632
All right. I'll give
that some thought.

39:27.632 --> 39:28.566
No, you won't.

39:30.568 --> 39:33.171
Joe would've been
proud of you, kid.

39:33.171 --> 39:34.872
I know I am.

39:37.275 --> 39:39.210
Thanks, Gutch.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.387
(engine starts)

39:49.387 --> 39:52.023
(sighs)

39:52.023 --> 39:53.358
Hey.
Hey.

39:53.358 --> 39:54.792
So, what's next for you?

39:54.792 --> 39:57.795
Uh, back to the grind.

39:57.795 --> 40:00.565
You know, protecting
the homeland.

40:00.565 --> 40:03.668
Chasing bad guys.
Yada yada yada.

40:03.668 --> 40:07.105
Thank you so much, Catherine.

40:07.105 --> 40:09.207
We couldn't have
pulled this off without you.

40:09.207 --> 40:12.210
He was a great man, Steve.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.345
We both owe him a lot.

40:14.345 --> 40:17.148
You still don't know, huh?

40:17.148 --> 40:18.216
What do you mean?

40:18.216 --> 40:21.452
Joe wasn't just my mentor.

40:21.452 --> 40:24.622
A father figure.

40:24.622 --> 40:26.958
He brought you
into my life, Catherine.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.059
How?

40:29.460 --> 40:31.396
We're gonna stop here
and try to hold them off

40:31.396 --> 40:33.731
till the chopper arrives.

40:33.731 --> 40:36.234
It should be here
in a few minutes.
Joe?

40:36.234 --> 40:38.870
There's 20 of them
and two of us.

40:38.870 --> 40:41.039
We're gonna be dead
in a couple minutes.

40:41.039 --> 40:43.274
We're not dying today, son.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.678
I want you to promise me
when we make it back,

40:46.678 --> 40:49.480
I want you to ask Catherine out.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.416
That woman's a keeper, Steve.
(chuckles, coughs)

40:51.416 --> 40:52.850
And I don't want to hear...

40:52.850 --> 40:54.152
hear you say no, either.

40:54.152 --> 40:55.953
That's how you
pay me back for this.

40:55.953 --> 40:58.122
MAN:
Go, go, go!
Okay.

40:58.122 --> 41:00.024
Okay, Joe.

41:00.024 --> 41:01.592
(beeping)

41:01.592 --> 41:03.594
CATHERINE: Steve,
what the hell are you doing

41:03.594 --> 41:05.096
calling me on a secured line?

41:05.096 --> 41:07.565
I may have told your C.O.
that I was gravely wounded

41:07.565 --> 41:09.534
in battle,
which is actually half true.

41:09.534 --> 41:11.536
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

41:11.536 --> 41:13.638
But, look, that's, uh, that's
not the reason I'm calling.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.506
I, uh...

41:15.506 --> 41:19.677
I've been invited
to the Army-Navy Gala next month

41:19.677 --> 41:22.313
at West Point, and presuming
I can get stateside for it

41:22.313 --> 41:25.083
in time,
I was just wondering if, uh...

41:25.083 --> 41:27.485
wondered if you'd like
to be my plus one?

41:27.485 --> 41:30.288
Uh, well, you know,
that depends.

41:30.288 --> 41:33.057
Are you gonna be able-bodied
enough to dance with me?

41:33.057 --> 41:35.927
I'll-I'll hit that dance floor
on crutches if I have to.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.796
Just to eliminate any confusion,
this is not...

41:38.796 --> 41:40.732
um, we wouldn't be going
as friends.

41:40.732 --> 41:44.602
This is me, uh...
this is me asking you out.

41:44.602 --> 41:47.538
On a date. On a date.

41:50.608 --> 41:52.677
Hello? Catherine? Hello?

41:52.677 --> 41:55.046
Yeah. Uh, yeah.

41:55.046 --> 41:58.383
Question for you. Um...

41:58.383 --> 42:00.385
what took you so long?

42:00.385 --> 42:03.221
Let's just say I, uh...

42:03.221 --> 42:06.290
I took some good advice
from an old friend.

42:08.359 --> 42:11.529
I'm really glad you
took his advice.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.464
I am, too.

42:20.171 --> 42:22.240
You take care of yourself, okay?

42:22.240 --> 42:24.409
You, too, kid.

42:28.646 --> 42:30.648
Hey.

42:30.648 --> 42:33.584
Till next time.
