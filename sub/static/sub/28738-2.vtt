The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.545 --> 00:04.545
We can get you out!

00:04.630 --> 00:06.357
You and the baby!
But you have to go right now!

00:06.381 --> 00:08.247
- Who's "we?"
- Marthas. Go!

00:08.675 --> 00:10.211
Do you know
Commander Mackenzie?

00:10.302 --> 00:13.045
He has a daughter.
I can't leave without her.

00:13.138 --> 00:14.629
I'll take you to Mackenzie.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.994
- Don't move!
<i>- You're being cruel.</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:19.805
Confusing her like this.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.056
I'm confusing her?

00:21.772 --> 00:23.041
You're gonna see your son again.

00:23.065 --> 00:25.273
- I'm not his mother anymore.
- Of course you are.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.983
<i>Your son is in Canada.
He's free. With your wife.</i>

00:31.823 --> 00:34.486
Call an ambulance.
Dear Lord, what have you done?

00:36.328 --> 00:38.208
<i>As a person
in need of protection,</i>

00:38.247 --> 00:40.739
- do you wish to seek asylum in the country of Canada?
- Yes.

00:40.958 --> 00:43.398
<i>God has made me master
of an incredible woman.</i>

00:43.460 --> 00:45.167
<i>You don't need to protect me.</i>

00:46.672 --> 00:48.004
- Are you Luke?
- Yeah.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.877
Your wife saved my life.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.880
They're safe. Emily and the baby.
They made it.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.046
<i>You've got a new posting.</i>

00:59.268 --> 01:01.385
You're not gonna be
any trouble, are you?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.178
No, sir.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.996
<i>I used to be
bad at waiting.</i>

01:26.461 --> 01:29.579
<i>"They also serve who stand
and wait," Aunt Lydia said.</i>

01:30.799 --> 01:33.883
<i>She also said, "Not all of you
will make it through.</i>

01:35.262 --> 01:38.926
<i>"Some of you will fall
on dry ground or thorns.</i>

01:39.683 --> 01:41.766
<i>"Some of you
are shallow-rooted.</i>

01:42.311 --> 01:44.052
<i>"Think of yourselves as seeds.</i>

01:44.771 --> 01:47.605
<i>"What kind of seed
will you be, girls?"</i>

01:50.110 --> 01:52.193
<i>I pretend I'm a tree.</i>

01:53.405 --> 01:54.987
<i>And I wait.</i>

02:01.913 --> 02:03.279
She's very blessed.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.880
Blessed be the fruit.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.377
May the Lord open.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.477
We're about to take back Chicago,
my mistress tells me.

02:27.773 --> 02:30.436
I will keep our soldiers
in my prayers.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.608
Praise be.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.114
I've been praying
for the Waterfords, too.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.406
That is kind of you,
Ofmatthew.

02:43.288 --> 02:47.498
Their poor sweet baby,
wherever she is.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.248
I can't imagine
what came over Ofjoseph.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.213
I am Ofjoseph.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.088
<i>Now who's
the pious little shit?</i>

03:10.732 --> 03:11.893
Go in grace.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.394
Praise be to you.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.625
Ofrobert, did you see?

03:31.128 --> 03:32.790
They have canned tomatoes.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.293
- Praise be.
- Mmm.

04:13.712 --> 04:14.793
Sneaky.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.503
I'm learning.

04:18.382 --> 04:19.668
Casey had her baby.

04:20.635 --> 04:23.343
A shredder.
Heart on the outside.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.671
That's awful.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.218
The Americans
are about to lose Chicago.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.679
At least that's what
Ofmatthew says.

04:39.738 --> 04:41.980
Did you ask your Martha
about the Mackenzies?

04:42.073 --> 04:44.656
I tried.
She's super mean.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.568
I'd leave the Marthas alone.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.432
Do you need help
with something?

04:49.456 --> 04:50.992
No, thank you.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.372
The Marthas
don't trust us.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.794
Who does?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.848
They only had golden beets.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.052
That's fine.
They'll roast up great.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.279
I thought you said steak.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.356
This is a filet.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.195
Isn't that better?

05:28.245 --> 05:30.202
Not if you like flavor.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.992
I can go back.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.703
Hope we have enough butter
for a Bearnaise sauce.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.547
Parlor.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.131
They're waiting for you.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.463
Blessed be the fruit, dear.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.571
May the Lord open.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.954
I'm glad to see you're feeling
a bit better, Aunt Lydia.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.408
Aren't you kind?

06:19.212 --> 06:23.126
I didn't figure I'd see you
back in this house any time soon.

06:25.260 --> 06:28.344
You've certainly bounced back,
haven't you?

06:29.764 --> 06:32.006
God is merciful indeed.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.133
Lydia's here
checking up on us.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.018
Nothing of the sort.

06:36.354 --> 06:40.644
A routine visit to see how our girl
is settling into her new household.

06:40.984 --> 06:41.984
She's fine.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.735
- She's fine.
- She's fine.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.608
Ah, have you found her

06:47.407 --> 06:48.407
respectful?

06:48.491 --> 06:50.983
We've had trouble
with her in the past.

06:51.912 --> 06:52.912
Yes.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.579
I want to go now.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.786
All right, my love.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.376
All right.

06:59.461 --> 07:00.461
And The Ceremony?

07:00.962 --> 07:04.672
Our records show that Ofjoseph's
fertile time was last week.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.346
Yep.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.139
Aces.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.434
Praise be.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.266
Mrs. Lawrence?

07:24.152 --> 07:25.939
She's...
She's just tired.

07:26.988 --> 07:27.988
All right, my love.

07:29.574 --> 07:30.574
Pleasure,

07:31.493 --> 07:32.493
as always.

07:40.669 --> 07:41.705
What's wrong with her?

07:43.088 --> 07:44.088
I don't know.

07:44.923 --> 07:48.542
If there is something unseemly going on
in this household with Commander Lawrence,

07:48.635 --> 07:50.297
you know you can
always tell me.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.341
Emily was here two days

07:53.431 --> 07:55.218
and God only knows
what he did to her.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.105
May I see you out,
Aunt Lydia?

08:03.358 --> 08:04.358
Thank you.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.951
I'd like to look
at your room.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.495
To see if
it's shipshape.

08:24.379 --> 08:25.379
All right.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.068
Are you okay?

08:50.196 --> 08:51.778
Maybe next time is better.
All right?

08:52.991 --> 08:54.527
You shut your mouth!

08:56.327 --> 08:57.534
Ow!

08:59.581 --> 09:01.413
Aunt Elizabeth was soft.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.287
I would never have put you
in a new posting.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.165
After what you pulled
at the Mackenzies',

09:07.255 --> 09:08.746
you should be on the wall!

09:21.019 --> 09:22.180
Everything is

09:23.730 --> 09:24.730
in hand,

09:25.732 --> 09:26.732
Commander Lawrence.

09:31.613 --> 09:36.153
Ofjoseph was seen gossiping
at Loaves and Fishes.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.821
That simply will not do.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.531
Spare the rod,
spoil the Handmaid.

09:44.918 --> 09:45.918
Something like that.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.002
Quite right.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.337
Quite right.

09:51.633 --> 09:52.749
Blessed day.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.262
Take care, dear.

09:58.723 --> 09:59.723
Under His eye.

10:05.939 --> 10:06.939
Just...

10:24.582 --> 10:27.040
I wonder what the voltage is
on those things.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.044
<i>Hello, you still there?</i>

11:03.246 --> 11:04.453
Uh, yeah.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.123
Still here.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.977
<i>...need to drop off
the notarized form by 3:00 p.m.</i>

11:08.001 --> 11:10.539
Uh, no. My lawyer said
that she'd drop them off.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.081
<i>Well, she hasn't.</i>

11:12.172 --> 11:14.532
<i>So if they're not there by 3:00,
the application's rejected.</i>

11:15.008 --> 11:17.341
All right. All right, fine.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.760
Yeah, thanks.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.105
Yes.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.724
Yeah. Oh-oh.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.434
Look who's home, Nichole.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.644
Hey, come say hi.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.323
Hey!

11:40.241 --> 11:42.403
I've gotta go to the lawyer's
and then the embassy.

11:42.493 --> 11:43.493
Oh, come on.

11:43.578 --> 11:44.819
Play with her.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.199
Or hold her.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.742
Just for a minute.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.243
Yeah, I gotta, uh...

11:49.334 --> 11:51.667
I've gotta get these
forms notarized

11:51.753 --> 11:54.086
for the National Insurance
Number application.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.692
Right. You're gonna be
back for dinner?

11:56.049 --> 11:57.049
Emily?

11:58.009 --> 11:59.009
Right.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.386
Um, yeah.
I'm fine with it.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.176
Uh...

12:05.683 --> 12:06.683
Um...

12:07.936 --> 12:10.223
She's got family in Canada,
though, right?

12:11.105 --> 12:13.893
So, when's she gonna
let 'em know that she's here?

12:15.235 --> 12:16.235
I'm working on it.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.397
Look, everyone's timeline
is different.

12:21.324 --> 12:22.604
Let me know
if you need anything.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.318
Chives! Not green onions.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.979
This is healing up nicely.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.791
No swelling or discharge.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.215
Any pain?

12:38.883 --> 12:39.883
Some.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.676
That should go away in time.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.471
Cartilage doesn't heal
as well as other tissue...

12:45.556 --> 12:46.556
It's avascular.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.053
Also, chondrocytes can't mobilize
to damaged areas.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.436
Right.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.376
So you'll probably
end up with a scar.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.937
Uh, all your blood work
came back normal.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.110
CBC, glyco, metabolic.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.734
Pelvic ultrasound
and pap look good, too.

13:05.618 --> 13:10.579
Um, you do have
some small uterine fibroids

13:10.665 --> 13:12.531
that we're gonna want
to keep an eye on.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.625
Okay.

13:14.877 --> 13:20.418
Follow-up appointments, uh, dental surgeon,
optometrist, pulmonologist.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.590
This is a referral
to an OB-GYN

13:25.680 --> 13:28.764
for a consult on clitoral reconstruction
when you're ready.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.393
And Dr. Wilson is a terrific psychiatrist
I want you to see

13:32.478 --> 13:34.435
now that you're transitioning
out of acute care.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.229
She does a lot of work
with your community.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.484
That's all?

13:39.569 --> 13:42.983
That's it. I'll want to see you
for physicals every other year.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.649
And, uh,
watch that cholesterol.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.119
Cholesterol?

13:49.912 --> 13:52.325
Yeah, it's a little high
for a woman your age.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.227
You should be able to manage it
with diet and exercise.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.251
Okay.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.197
Cora? Do you have
anything for burns?

14:28.409 --> 14:29.525
Fantastic.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.859
Look,
she can't stay here.

14:30.912 --> 14:32.014
She has
to wait somewhere.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.038
Not my problem.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.488
I just get the passes!

14:41.255 --> 14:42.416
You're helping her escape?

14:42.715 --> 14:43.715
Beth?

14:45.385 --> 14:46.385
Yes.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.965
We had to change
pickup locations.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.718
I can't take her to the new one
until later when it is safe.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.392
Why can't she stay here?

14:53.684 --> 14:55.346
You're new, both of you.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.116
You don't know
how things work around here.

15:01.984 --> 15:02.984
Ooh.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.273
Hen party.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.442
Where's Mrs. Lawrence's tea?

15:11.828 --> 15:12.908
It's coming right now, sir.

15:22.964 --> 15:23.964
Who are you?

15:26.342 --> 15:27.503
My name's Alison, sir.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.301
Uh, she's come to help polish
the silver for your meeting.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.264
That's a lie.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.303
You two

15:38.521 --> 15:40.228
are always finding friends.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.648
I'll see if I can find
a Guardian to take you home.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.696
Or wherever.

15:52.577 --> 15:53.943
Stay in this room.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.543
Commander Lawrence.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.760
I don't like strangers
in my house.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.316
Why is there a stranger
in my house?

16:29.238 --> 16:31.400
She's just here for a while.
Then she's gone.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.116
Sir.

16:35.661 --> 16:36.777
I asked you why.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.661
She's getting out.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.914
She just needs
a safe place to wait.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.004
"She." "She."

16:46.088 --> 16:49.126
You keep saying that
like it means something.

16:49.217 --> 16:50.549
I don't know that person.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.338
You helped me.

16:59.644 --> 17:00.760
You don't know me.

17:05.148 --> 17:06.310
Is that what you think?

17:10.238 --> 17:14.152
That woman, those Marthas...
I know what their life is like.

17:15.409 --> 17:18.026
She has a chance for something better.
Let her have it.

17:21.832 --> 17:22.832
Okay.

17:26.462 --> 17:27.462
It's your funeral.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.275
It's all right.
She can stay.

17:55.741 --> 17:56.822
What did you do?

17:57.577 --> 17:58.577
I convinced him.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.153
That must've been
some blowjob.

18:01.664 --> 18:02.745
Red Center Special.

18:05.293 --> 18:06.293
I can take this.

18:07.628 --> 18:08.628
Okay.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.205
Just knock and leave it
outside her door.

18:11.382 --> 18:12.382
Mmm-hmm.

18:14.302 --> 18:15.383
And thanks.

18:35.781 --> 18:36.781
Close the door.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.515
We'll lose the opportunity.
Everything's already set up.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.969
Forget it.
I'm not going with you.

19:07.063 --> 19:09.430
If I walk back alone,
I'm gonna get questioned.

19:09.523 --> 19:10.639
Not my problem.

19:10.733 --> 19:11.733
Cora!

19:12.818 --> 19:14.309
Lawrence is in the parlor.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.110
He'll probably be there
for a while.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.197
We should go now.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.397
I wanna see how it works.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.982
We almost never move people.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.108
Messages, black-market
stuff, sometimes.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.203
People are difficult.

19:23.454 --> 19:24.454
Dangerous.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.530
I've noticed.
I can handle myself.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.741
What? Were you in the military
or something before?

19:28.959 --> 19:29.959
No. Were you?

19:30.961 --> 19:32.327
High school chemistry teacher.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.163
Ah. Well, I'm the only reason

19:35.257 --> 19:37.319
why you're not all
in an interrogation room right now,

19:37.343 --> 19:38.379
so you owe me.

19:38.469 --> 19:40.005
Come on,
<i>Breaking Bad,</i> let's go.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.421
Cora's not going.
So you need me.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.177
- I'm coming with you.
- June.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.431
I am not afraid
of hard work.

19:52.983 --> 19:53.983
All right.

19:54.819 --> 19:55.980
But not like that.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.629
<i>Strange
to finally be invisible.</i>

20:16.590 --> 20:18.832
<i>One of the reasons they chose
red was the opposite.</i>

20:20.177 --> 20:22.419
<i>We're easy to catch
because we're easy to see.</i>

20:23.764 --> 20:25.221
<i>Like blood on snow.</i>

20:31.480 --> 20:32.541
Did you check her?

20:32.565 --> 20:33.565
Clear.

20:34.692 --> 20:35.692
Keep going.

20:46.454 --> 20:47.494
Straight line!

20:49.707 --> 20:50.707
No loitering!

20:53.419 --> 20:54.459
Straight line!

20:58.215 --> 20:59.581
Have your passes ready.

21:10.895 --> 21:11.895
Keep walking.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.064
Pass?

21:15.524 --> 21:16.524
Step up.

21:18.652 --> 21:19.755
This pass is expired.

21:19.779 --> 21:20.986
I did nothing wrong.

21:21.071 --> 21:22.299
- I... I did nothing wrong.
- Come with me.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.323
I did nothing wrong.

21:23.407 --> 21:24.407
Move it!

21:25.701 --> 21:26.701
Let's go!

21:57.358 --> 21:58.358
<i>No Handmaids.</i>

21:59.109 --> 22:00.629
<i>We're not allowed
in this part of town.</i>

22:02.112 --> 22:04.775
<i>Commercial laundries,
too many chemicals.</i>

22:07.701 --> 22:11.741
<i>Gilead's green, but they still like
their dry cleaning.</i>

22:32.393 --> 22:33.393
Shut the door.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.934
Stay out of sight
and keep quiet.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.648
Someone'll come for you.

22:45.739 --> 22:46.775
You can't wait with me?

22:47.783 --> 22:49.490
We have to get back
before we're missed.

22:50.619 --> 22:51.860
God bless our labors.

22:53.247 --> 22:54.738
Through work we're cleansed.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.920
Good luck.

23:01.005 --> 23:02.005
June, come on.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.049
Let's go.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.966
Sorry about what
I said earlier.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.642
You know, blowjob.

23:16.729 --> 23:17.729
I've heard worse.

23:18.689 --> 23:21.147
Marthas are sinners,
too, so we're told.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.725
I had my tubes tied.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.986
Lucky I can cook or I would've been
upstairs at Jezebel's

23:27.072 --> 23:28.153
instead of in the kitchen.

23:29.158 --> 23:30.490
Did you know Moira?

23:30.576 --> 23:31.576
She called herself Ruby?

23:31.911 --> 23:32.911
Yeah.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.820
She made it to Canada.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.873
Alison's not going to Canada.

23:41.629 --> 23:42.665
She's going deeper in.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.212
A resistance cell
out west somewhere.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.169
She's valuable.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.375
A chemistry teacher?

23:48.928 --> 23:50.339
She makes bombs.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.807
Like Ofglen.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.301
Oh, so you know her work?

24:01.482 --> 24:04.202
I guess you don't know what you're capable
of till you have to do it.

24:28.926 --> 24:30.007
Hey!

24:42.898 --> 24:43.898
Come on, boys.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.859
Green onions would've
worked in this, by the way.

24:51.949 --> 24:54.987
Just the green part,
and a little less.

24:55.411 --> 24:57.368
All right, Chef Mansplainer.

24:57.621 --> 24:58.621
It's delicious.

24:58.914 --> 24:59.914
Thank you.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.579
I hope you don't mind the fish.
I should've asked.

25:03.836 --> 25:07.250
No, fish is great. It turns out
I have high cholesterol so...

25:07.756 --> 25:08.756
Really?

25:08.841 --> 25:11.128
Yeah, all the meat
and butter, I guess.

25:12.052 --> 25:13.714
You know what helps
with those arteries?

25:15.347 --> 25:16.508
A little vino.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.931
Yeah, I never had
that problem before Gilead.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.634
I was a vegetarian.

25:21.395 --> 25:24.229
Yeah, it's not like it matters.
You eat what they give you.

25:29.403 --> 25:33.238
June was big on the fish.
And chicken.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.116
And Meatless Mondays.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.327
It was kinda
pushy of her, huh?

25:40.748 --> 25:44.037
I mean, she sets the menu,
you do most of the cooking...

25:44.835 --> 25:46.622
No, I didn't mind.

25:47.296 --> 25:50.414
What about, uh...
What about your wife?

25:50.507 --> 25:52.169
She's, uh...
She's a veggie or not?

25:52.509 --> 25:53.509
Luke.

25:53.594 --> 25:55.756
What? I'm just...
I'm... I'm curious.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.007
Because it can
be hard, right?

25:57.097 --> 25:59.701
You're trying to figure out how to
raise your kid. Do you... You know...

25:59.725 --> 26:02.684
You know, could you please, uh,
go get us some more potatoes?

26:02.770 --> 26:05.012
Just, what, was it veggie
or not for the kid?

26:05.105 --> 26:06.225
Go get the fucking potatoes.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.607
You know... I...

26:15.616 --> 26:17.482
I... Sorry, excuse me.

26:23.373 --> 26:24.864
There's, um, pie.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.251
Apple.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.096
I'm sorry.

26:38.388 --> 26:39.388
Don't even.

26:40.182 --> 26:41.182
That was all him.

26:45.979 --> 26:48.141
You know, he looks at you
and he sees June.

26:50.234 --> 26:51.350
He'd want her to call.

26:52.194 --> 26:54.151
He looks at you,
he's afraid she wouldn't.

26:55.489 --> 26:56.821
Nah, she would.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.365
She's a lot stronger than me.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.318
Oh, I don't know about that.

27:07.376 --> 27:08.376
I can't.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.958
Yeah, because
it's terrifying.

27:13.924 --> 27:16.416
And you're right to be scared.
I mean, look...

27:17.344 --> 27:20.963
I've seen a lot of these reunions
and it's not always a storybook ending.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.263
But nobody's talking
about happily ever after.

27:27.980 --> 27:28.980
Just after.

27:34.194 --> 27:35.776
And he does
make a great pie.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.657
Rita would
never let me help.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.328
Anything to get me
to bed faster.

27:55.799 --> 27:56.799
Alison!

27:56.884 --> 27:57.884
- Shit!
- Fuck!

27:57.968 --> 27:59.320
What happened?

27:59.344 --> 28:00.822
- Shh! Quiet!
- Guardians. They shot her.

28:00.846 --> 28:01.886
Did they follow you?

28:02.014 --> 28:03.366
- Get her to the basement.
- Come on!

28:03.390 --> 28:04.659
No, I don't think so.

28:04.683 --> 28:05.683
- I'm sorry.
- Shh!

28:05.767 --> 28:06.953
I didn't know
where else to go.

28:06.977 --> 28:08.593
Let's go!

28:08.687 --> 28:09.687
Shh! Come on!

28:21.033 --> 28:22.033
Okay.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.655
Towels are to the left.

28:25.913 --> 28:27.193
Straight ahead.
Go through there.

28:27.706 --> 28:28.826
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

28:31.335 --> 28:32.335
Okay.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.995
Lay her down.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.170
Okay. Okay.

28:38.634 --> 28:39.634
Thanks.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.614
It's okay. She's just trying
to stop the bleeding.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.675
It's okay. Breathe.
All right?

28:44.765 --> 28:46.097
Is there anyone
we can call?

28:46.308 --> 28:47.970
I don't know.
Uh, I'm trying to think.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.468
- Cora?
- Shit.

28:49.603 --> 28:50.603
Beth?

28:54.691 --> 28:57.980
Okay. Shh.
Put your hand here. Okay.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.113
Okay, come on.

29:05.118 --> 29:06.518
Shh.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.283
What's going on?

29:12.209 --> 29:13.245
Who's in the basement?

29:14.044 --> 29:16.707
Just Beth.
We saw a rat.

29:17.714 --> 29:18.714
She screamed.

29:19.216 --> 29:20.216
Liar.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.093
That's two.

29:24.346 --> 29:25.382
You wanna try?

29:28.767 --> 29:30.008
Someone's hurt.

29:31.228 --> 29:33.390
Same someone who was here earlier?
Cora, get the door.

29:34.231 --> 29:35.438
She's here, too.

29:35.524 --> 29:36.765
There's another woman.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.578
She's the one who's hurt, sir.
She screamed.

29:38.610 --> 29:39.610
Get her out.

29:40.070 --> 29:41.464
- Commander Lawrence...
- You heard me. Get her out.

29:41.488 --> 29:42.488
Blessed evening.

29:42.572 --> 29:43.633
Is the Commander home?

29:43.657 --> 29:45.319
Yes. What's going on?

29:45.409 --> 29:46.803
We need
to speak with him.

29:46.827 --> 29:48.910
Okay. I'll go get
him for you.

29:48.996 --> 29:49.996
Praise be.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.330
Evening, Commander Lawrence.

29:52.582 --> 29:53.618
Sorry to disturb you.

29:53.959 --> 29:56.167
Not at all.
What's... What's up?

29:56.420 --> 29:58.260
Had a bit
of trouble in town tonight.

29:59.423 --> 30:01.085
A couple of fugitives.
Marthas.

30:01.925 --> 30:04.212
Let's get
you some coffee.

30:04.594 --> 30:07.257
Thank you, sir.
We'll just be a minute.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.259
We're talking to all
the households in the area

30:12.352 --> 30:14.264
to see if you noticed
anything amiss tonight.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.416
We have a man doing a perimeter check
of your property right now.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.352
Joseph?
Is everything all right?

30:19.276 --> 30:20.767
Everything's fine,
my love.

30:21.361 --> 30:22.852
Why don't you
go back to bed?

30:23.363 --> 30:24.604
When we have guests?

30:24.990 --> 30:27.778
Don't be silly. Has he offered
you something warm to drink?

30:27.868 --> 30:29.053
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

30:29.077 --> 30:31.239
Good.
Cold night like this.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.993
Make yourself comfortable.
It'll just be a minute.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.215
Come help me, please.

31:10.994 --> 31:13.452
Cora, can you please
clean that up?

31:15.540 --> 31:16.540
Go.

31:27.844 --> 31:28.844
Just breathe.

31:29.596 --> 31:31.436
It's okay. Breathe.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.427
Shh... Shh...

31:33.850 --> 31:35.244
- What's going on?
- Guardians.

31:35.268 --> 31:36.329
We have to be quiet.

31:36.353 --> 31:37.594
- How is she?
- Bad.

31:37.687 --> 31:38.768
Let me see.

31:38.855 --> 31:39.916
There isn't
a lot of bleeding.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.476
She might have
internal bleeding.

31:41.566 --> 31:42.932
Please.
Don't let me die.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.253
No one's gonna
let you die, okay?

31:44.277 --> 31:45.277
Don't worry.

31:45.362 --> 31:46.422
Please don't let me die.

31:46.446 --> 31:47.486
It's gonna be okay.
I know.

31:47.531 --> 31:49.211
It's gonna be okay.
I need you to be quiet.

31:49.408 --> 31:50.990
Shh...
Breathe slowly.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.012
Those Guardians can get
an ambulance here in two minutes.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.305
- We tell them...
- No.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.182
...we panicked and let them in.
Christian charity.

31:56.206 --> 31:57.266
You know
we can't do that.

31:57.290 --> 31:58.290
They can save her!

31:58.375 --> 31:59.435
They get her,
she talks.

31:59.459 --> 32:00.666
They get the entire network!

32:00.752 --> 32:02.021
And they're gonna fucking
kill her anyways!

32:02.045 --> 32:03.189
Perimeter
is looking clear!

32:03.213 --> 32:04.213
Shit!

32:04.297 --> 32:05.358
Perimeter is clear!

32:05.382 --> 32:06.998
Shit!

32:07.092 --> 32:08.092
Shh!

32:12.848 --> 32:16.307
I need you to be quiet!
Listen to me! Be quiet.

32:22.107 --> 32:24.019
Shit. Get down!
Come here.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.975
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay!

32:29.489 --> 32:31.105
Shut up!

32:38.832 --> 32:39.832
I'm sorry.

32:41.918 --> 32:43.278
I'm sorry.

32:50.677 --> 32:53.090
Okay. Okay.
Are you okay? Okay.

33:05.650 --> 33:06.794
I think
they're gone.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.754
- Do you know where you're supposed to go next?
- Yeah.

33:08.778 --> 33:10.548
- Do you know how to get there?
- I think so.

33:10.572 --> 33:11.632
Is there
a way out down here?

33:11.656 --> 33:12.717
Yeah.
Through there to the right.

33:12.741 --> 33:15.199
Door leads to the backyard.
Go before Lawrence sees you.

33:36.723 --> 33:37.723
I need you to go.

33:37.807 --> 33:38.807
I can't.

33:38.892 --> 33:39.952
- Come on.
- I can go home.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.329
- I'll go home.
- No. This place is not your home.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.345
Listen to me.
I know you feel bad.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.179
We all do, but she knew
what could happen.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.389
We all did.
Listen to me!

33:46.483 --> 33:48.440
Do not let this
be for nothing. Okay?

33:48.527 --> 33:51.110
- Okay.
- Go. Hurry. Godspeed.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.196
Okay.

33:56.993 --> 33:59.110
This is why
we don't move people.

34:22.435 --> 34:24.427
Go see to Mrs. Lawrence.

34:37.742 --> 34:38.822
I was wrong.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.779
It's not your funeral
after all.

34:48.503 --> 34:50.790
Do you even
know who she was?

34:52.966 --> 34:53.966
No, sir.

34:58.305 --> 35:01.343
Women like you
are like children.

35:02.559 --> 35:05.518
Asking for too much,
taking whatever you want.

35:05.604 --> 35:06.970
Damn the consequences.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.232
I'm sorry, sir.

35:11.318 --> 35:12.318
I bet you are.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.361
Is Mrs. Lawrence okay?

35:14.446 --> 35:19.362
Do not presume
to speak to me about my wife!

35:32.881 --> 35:34.713
I knew it was a mistake.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.298
Sir, we had no idea
she would come back here.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.677
I mean taking you in.

35:51.900 --> 35:52.900
Clean it up.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.166
Not through
the house.

37:28.163 --> 37:29.163
Beth!

38:30.391 --> 38:31.391
Argh!

41:30.822 --> 41:31.822
For your hands.

41:35.910 --> 41:36.910
Thank you.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.080
And Cora?

41:41.332 --> 41:44.120
Lawrence sent her away.
I don't know where.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.136
When they've healed,
I'll give you some butter.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.340
It's what we use
to keep 'em soft.

41:59.517 --> 42:00.928
He doesn't like liars.

42:23.291 --> 42:24.291
Hey.

42:26.627 --> 42:27.627
Are you all right?

42:33.843 --> 42:34.843
You hungry?

42:38.389 --> 42:39.389
You wet?

42:42.852 --> 42:43.852
Hi.

42:45.021 --> 42:46.102
Hey.

42:47.940 --> 42:49.056
I'll, um...

42:49.817 --> 42:51.024
I'll go get her bottle.

42:53.279 --> 42:54.279
Oh.

42:55.656 --> 42:56.737
Hi, baby girl.

42:57.909 --> 43:00.151
What's wrong, huh?

43:02.538 --> 43:05.246
Whatever it is, it can't be bad
as all that now.

43:05.875 --> 43:08.208
Huh? Hmm?

43:08.753 --> 43:09.753
Mmm.

43:12.381 --> 43:14.589
You always got
your shit together.

43:16.344 --> 43:18.961
Nichole,
or us, or work...

43:20.765 --> 43:21.765
Emily.

43:23.434 --> 43:26.472
Yeah. Yeah,
I totally got my shit together.

43:26.562 --> 43:30.977
That's why I'm up all hours feeding
this little monster, huh?

43:34.737 --> 43:38.276
I could be waking up
next to somethin' pretty, hmm?

43:39.242 --> 43:41.154
We're all fucked up, okay?

43:42.036 --> 43:46.326
Isn't that right?
We're all fucked up, right?

43:48.417 --> 43:50.784
I remember when Hannah
was this small.

43:51.045 --> 43:52.045
Yeah.

43:53.172 --> 43:54.172
Yeah.

43:55.716 --> 43:57.673
It's your big sister
we're talking about.

43:59.011 --> 44:00.377
Yeah.

44:00.805 --> 44:02.797
June went back to save her.

44:05.226 --> 44:06.226
'Cause...

44:07.270 --> 44:08.386
I couldn't.

44:10.815 --> 44:12.932
She had another job
in mind for you.

44:17.947 --> 44:20.280
Yeah.

44:20.741 --> 44:22.607
All right, go on.
Get outta here. I got this.

44:22.785 --> 44:23.992
Go on. Get out.

44:25.163 --> 44:27.075
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

44:27.957 --> 44:29.243
Hey.

44:36.424 --> 44:37.835
You look like your mommy.

44:40.303 --> 44:41.303
Yeah.

45:44.533 --> 45:47.492
My mistress said she wasn't even
a Martha from this district.

45:48.412 --> 45:50.812
Guardians tracked her footprints through
the Quinns' backyard

45:50.873 --> 45:52.660
but lost her trail
at the creek.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.167
It's like she vanished.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.461
Like God carried her off.

45:59.674 --> 46:00.674
Hardly.

46:02.009 --> 46:04.171
A wicked old lady like that?
So ungrateful.

46:05.137 --> 46:08.175
She had safety,
and a home, and purpose.

46:09.308 --> 46:11.140
They should take an eye
when they catch her.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.226
Maybe her ears, too.

46:13.813 --> 46:15.179
Did you hear Ofjohn died?

46:16.774 --> 46:17.774
Yes.

46:18.567 --> 46:20.308
Poor angel.
Traffic accident.

46:20.987 --> 46:22.853
Her walking partner snapped.

46:23.823 --> 46:25.359
Pushed her in front of a bus.

46:30.579 --> 46:31.740
God rest her soul.

46:44.385 --> 46:47.594
One or two?

46:48.431 --> 46:49.431
Two.

46:50.141 --> 46:52.599
Two or three?

46:55.062 --> 46:56.098
Three.

46:56.731 --> 46:58.518
Three or four?

47:03.029 --> 47:04.315
About the same?

47:11.495 --> 47:12.495
Three.

47:13.581 --> 47:14.947
Fifth line clear?

47:15.041 --> 47:16.657
Even a little bit
of the bottom line?

47:18.377 --> 47:19.377
Yes.

47:20.796 --> 47:22.003
Better now...

47:22.089 --> 47:23.089
or worse?

47:23.174 --> 47:24.174
Better?

47:25.009 --> 47:26.009
Worse?

47:28.596 --> 47:29.596
Worse?

47:32.099 --> 47:33.099
Better?

47:34.602 --> 47:35.602
Worse?

47:36.771 --> 47:37.771
Better?

47:38.981 --> 47:40.188
Worse?

47:44.028 --> 47:46.188
Better?

47:46.822 --> 47:47.822
Worse?

48:27.363 --> 48:28.363
Hello?

48:30.241 --> 48:31.241
Hi.

48:33.536 --> 48:34.536
It's me.

48:39.250 --> 48:40.250
Em?

49:06.402 --> 49:07.938
Get off the road!

49:09.822 --> 49:11.654
Move your fucking car!

49:15.369 --> 49:17.406
Get out of
the fucking road!
