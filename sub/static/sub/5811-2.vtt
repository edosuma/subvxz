00:02.160 --> 00:04.128
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:04.400 --> 00:05.890
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:06.080 --> 00:09.721
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:09.920 --> 00:13.447
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.
I had to become someone else.</i>

00:13.640 --> 00:16.450
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

00:16.600 --> 00:19.763
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:21.724
Previously on Arrow...

00:21.920 --> 00:23.285
I wanna know what I'm doing here.

00:23.480 --> 00:24.561
Where's Waller?

00:24.760 --> 00:27.286
Your job is to infiltrate the area
and report back.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.125
<i>The media's
been calling them the Ghosts.</i>

00:32.280 --> 00:33.805
They're <i>like</i> nothing we'd
ever seen before.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.081
We need the Arrow.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.250
<i>I'm the one who controls the...
What do you people call them? The Ghosts?</i>

00:38.440 --> 00:39.441
I'm Damien Darhk.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.762
Mass murder? Killing innocents?
I didn't sign up for this.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.610
You signed up to follow my instructions.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.006
And if I don't help you?

00:45.240 --> 00:46.287
You don't have a choice.

00:46.480 --> 00:50.087
<i>Six months ago, the Arrow died.
But what he stood for didn't.</i>

00:50.320 --> 00:54.325
<i>I am declaring my intention
to fight for this city.</i>

01:31.360 --> 01:33.169
<i>- I</i> want a codename.
- What?

01:33.400 --> 01:37.007
Well, everyone's got a codename.
You even got a new one. I want a codename.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.168
Find the bomb and then we'll talk.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.966
I'm scanning frequency signatures.
I just know we're not gonna talk about it.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.406
John, you've got a runner.

01:45.640 --> 01:46.846
I'm on it.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.202
Got it. Ghosts' frequency of choice is on
the ground level.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.682
<i>Ten 'II get you 20 it's the bomb.
I don't mean that "it's the bomb,"</i>

01:54.920 --> 01:57.924
like it's good, like, "it's the bomb!"
I mean like it's the explosive.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.730
Got it. Ground floor.

02:08.840 --> 02:09.887
You better move it.

02:10.039 --> 02:11.201
<i>The signal strength I'm reading,</i>

02:11.400 --> 02:13.209
they can blow the treatment plant
from Central City.

02:20.280 --> 02:23.090
It's done. Get Diggle down here
to handle the dismantling.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.924
You know, it seems like he could
use a codename, too.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.526
Just get him down here.

02:34.920 --> 02:39.562
Saving the city's water supply, that's
an honest night's... Morning's work.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.407
Yeah, but no matter what we do,
these Ghosts, they keep coming.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.571
We still did a good job tonight.

02:45.760 --> 02:46.761
Yeah, not good enough.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.769
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

02:50.480 --> 02:52.209
Kind of felt like you were
out there for blood tonight.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.727
Look, you haven't been dealing with these
Ghosts as long as we have.

02:54.920 --> 02:58.049
If I go easy on them,
things are gonna end bad really fast.

02:58.280 --> 03:01.090
I'm worried that if you keep going the way
that you're going,

03:01.280 --> 03:03.442
you're going to put one
of them down permanently.

03:04.120 --> 03:08.250
I know where the line ends, okay?
And look, it's almost 9:00.

03:08.440 --> 03:11.125
Mrs. Danforth and Madison are gonna be
at our house in, like, an hour.

03:11.280 --> 03:16.446
So I have time for one of your lectures
or a shower. I pick shower.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.005
Is everything okay?

03:21.800 --> 03:23.643
You look nice.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.969
It's my first day back at Palmer Tech.
I get to be bossy today

03:27.120 --> 03:30.408
because I am the boss of a
multibillion-dollar corporation.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.928
I know I should be nervous, I know,
but I'm not. I'm actually really excited.

03:34.280 --> 03:39.002
You should be excited. That's why I got
you the first-day-as-a-boss fern.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.486
Aw.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.210
And packed your lunch.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.851
Who are you?

03:47.800 --> 03:49.165
Who are you?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.650
Answer me!

03:55.320 --> 03:56.526
All right.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.371
What?

04:41.360 --> 04:42.566
Come on.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.085
<i>Madison, how's school?</i>

04:47.240 --> 04:50.483
It's good. I graduate in May
with a degree in Ancient Philosophy.

04:50.680 --> 04:55.527
Ancient Philosophy? What happened to
your dream of being J.T.'s backup dancer?

04:55.720 --> 04:58.007
That's still plan B, obviously.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.881
It is so lovely to see you two. Really.
It's been far too long.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.684
No, Thea and I were glad you got in touch.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.724
Yeah, we were a little surprised though.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.611
Well, I admit that
reconnecting with the son and daughter

05:08.840 --> 05:13.721
of one of my dearest friends is not the
only reason that I wanted to see you.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.730
And here comes the crazy.

05:16.120 --> 05:19.442
Last week, like the rest of the city,
I saw the Green Arrow's broadcast.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.920
And it hit me.

05:21.080 --> 05:24.243
If that man could take up the Arrow's
mantle, I could take up your mother's.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.402
Um, how?

05:27.400 --> 05:28.765
By running for mayor.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.969
See, I told you. Crazy.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.290
No one's opposing me, obviously.
But there'll still need to be an election.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.289
There's a very good reason that no one
else is running.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.449
Yeah, the last three mayors
have been killed.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.887
To say nothing of the city's leadership
last week.

05:41.080 --> 05:43.128
Which is exactly why we need
a mayor more than ever.

05:43.400 --> 05:46.449
I want to step forward,
and I'm asking for your support.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.961
Wow. You guys look bigger than you did
when you were on my computer screen.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.327
Perhaps, we should begin with this
quarter's financials.

06:08.560 --> 06:12.610
Thank you. Uh... Okay.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.250
I know I don't have a business degree
or an accounting degree or an MBA,

06:16.480 --> 06:19.802
but this looks very, very bad.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.922
These are hard times
for everyone in Star City.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.531
This company is not immune.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.161
Fortunately, Mr. Holt
has devised us a way out.

06:27.440 --> 06:28.965
Oh. Goody.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.931
Um... Hello. I'm actually not
a member of the board.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.367
I work in the
Design Innovations department.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.489
Tell Ms. Smoak about your algorithm.

06:39.480 --> 06:40.970
It's pretty simple, actually.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.162
I used specialized A.l.
to determine maximum profits

06:43.320 --> 06:45.800
which can be derived with a minimal
amount of workforce reduction.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.609
Sorry. I probably could've
explained that better.

06:50.840 --> 06:51.841
<i>No. I got the gist.</i>

06:52.040 --> 06:54.202
You came up with a list
of people that you'd like me to fire.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.291
"Workforce reduction"
has a nicer sound to it.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.284
It's just kind of rolls off the tongue.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.331
Yeah. Well, the only thing
we'll be reducing

07:01.520 --> 07:02.681
is all of your bonuses, to start.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.566
We've already been down that road and
exhausted all other avenues, Ms. Smoak.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.202
I didn't come back to this company to put
the people who work here out of work.

07:10.360 --> 07:13.011
I came here to protect
Ray Palmer's legacy.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.204
And if we do not dramatically reduce our
costs or increase our profits,

07:16.360 --> 07:18.840
there won't be a legacy to protect.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.887
Am I the only one that has
a bad feeling about this?

07:24.240 --> 07:27.562
I mean, signing up to be mayor of this
town is like asking to be part of Titanic.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.564
You heard me try to talk
her out of running.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.241
I'm pretty sure that got covered up

07:32.480 --> 07:34.005
by you telling her we'd be at her big
announcement.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.009
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Jessica Danforth.</i>

07:39.000 --> 07:42.209
<i>Thank you. Thank you all so much.</i>

07:43.200 --> 07:46.761
<i>For the past six months, the mayor's
office at City Hall has stood vacant,</i>

07:47.200 --> 07:50.409
<i>waiting for someone to step forward
on behalf of Star City.</i>

07:50.880 --> 07:55.602
<i>And today, I am here with all of you
to tell you that I am stepping forward.</i>

08:00.240 --> 08:03.562
<i>Two years ago, I lost my good friend,
Moira Queen,</i>

08:04.400 --> 08:06.243
<i>who was also a candidate for mayor.</i>

08:06.400 --> 08:11.042
<i>And I remain inspired by her kind heart
and her selfless devotion to this city.</i>

08:18.200 --> 08:21.921
Shots came from up there. No, no, no.
You protect Jessica, okay? I've got this.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.640
The shots are just a distraction!
There's no Ghosts up here.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.126
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
You're not on her detail.

08:49.920 --> 08:50.967
Get back to the atrium!

08:51.120 --> 08:52.246
Oliver, how...

08:52.440 --> 08:53.805
Uh... Self-defense classes.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.011
She announces her candidacy

09:42.160 --> 09:44.003
and two seconds later
someone's trying to kill her?

09:44.160 --> 09:45.525
That must be a record, even for our city.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.887
And she's not dropping out of the race,
so this isn't over.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.884
My father has a protective detail on her.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.884
Yeah, but even with protection
at the announcement,

09:52.120 --> 09:53.167
she didn't seem to be too safe.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.521
Is it just me or is the shooting of a

09:54.680 --> 09:56.523
potential city leader
feeling a little Ghost-y?

09:56.840 --> 09:58.683
This guy wasn't wearing a mask so...

09:58.840 --> 10:03.323
There was something else different
about him. He left behind evidence.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.521
<i>Fingerprints.</i>

10:06.680 --> 10:08.205
How'd you get the
owner to part with his windshield?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.084
I bought his truck.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.924
It's one of the benefits
of your girlfriend inheriting

10:12.160 --> 10:16.210
a multibillion dollar conglomerate.
We have money now.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.886
I don't exactly think
that was money well spent.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.883
I don't think these prints
are gonna do us any good.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.047
What the hell?

10:24.200 --> 10:27.090
I'm not an expert, but I think our new
friend may have cut off his fingertips

10:27.320 --> 10:29.049
and played a little bit of mix and match.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.881
I'll keep digging. Maybe this is an M.O.
that'll tell us something.

10:32.040 --> 10:34.042
In the meantime, we backstop the SCPD.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.561
Thea was right. Jessica needs
more than the police can offer.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.884
She's in protective custody and I'm
pretty sure my father wouldn't be in favor

10:40.040 --> 10:41.724
of us staking out his precinct.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.006
I'll talk 110 him.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.924
Oh, yeah. That'll definitely go over well.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.524
Mrs. Danforth is under our protection,
24/7,

10:48.720 --> 10:50.131
until this nutbar's in cuffs.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.244
Do you have a minute?

10:57.400 --> 11:00.404
Caught your TV debut.
Guess you decided to stick around.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.086
It's gonna be different this time.

11:03.240 --> 11:06.210
Yeah, yeah, sure it will, 'cause you got
a new name, now, right? With a color.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.410
"Green Arrow." It's catchy.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.602
Jessica Danforth is a friend.

11:12.800 --> 11:13.961
We would like to help keep her safe.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.326
With everything this city's facing,

11:15.560 --> 11:16.800
I thought you could use
all the help you could get.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.611
You've been gone.
You don't know what this city's facing.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.922
Well, I'm not saying
it doesn't need saving.

11:23.480 --> 11:26.245
But a guy hiding behind
a mask isn't gonna get it done.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.602
What this city needs is someone willing to
stand up in the light of day,

11:30.760 --> 11:32.603
not a guy lurking around in the shadows.

11:33.920 --> 11:37.811
You say you're gonna be different
this time, huh? How?

12:48.320 --> 12:49.401
You're late.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.688
I know. Sorry. I was looking at
the numbers again and...

12:51.880 --> 12:55.248
Oh, you mean the "numbers" of people that
your magic "downsizing algorithm"

12:55.480 --> 12:56.686
is making us fire today.

12:56.920 --> 13:00.242
- Downsizing... You think I... I didn't.
- Let's get one thing straight.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.649
The only person who is allowed to talk in
sentence fragments around here is me.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.851
I developed my algorithm
to create a value matrix.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.731
To argue for company-wide
pay increases. Raises.

13:10.920 --> 13:14.049
Mr. Dennis turned it around and had me
use it to figure out who to fire.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.211
So this wasn't your idea?

13:16.440 --> 13:19.523
I was trying to get people to get paid
more, not paid nothing.

13:23.200 --> 13:26.682
Hi. I'm Karla Groves.
My supervisor asked me to come see you.

13:26.880 --> 13:31.442
Hi. Yes. Um...
I don't know quite how to say this...

13:32.360 --> 13:34.249
I'm fired.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.726
But clearly you do.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.406
As rumors go,
downsizing ones tend to go viral.

13:39.520 --> 13:42.967
I'm very sorry. I didn't come back here to
put people out of work.

13:43.360 --> 13:47.081
But I am hoping that by losing a fewjobs,
I can save many, many more.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.249
That looks like a little more than a few.

13:52.800 --> 13:56.600
Yes. The company is going
through a difficult time.

13:56.800 --> 13:57.881
I know.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.606
And when we heard you were coming back,
we thought things were going to get

14:00.800 --> 14:02.086
a lot better.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.086
Guess we were wrong.

14:11.960 --> 14:16.488
I'm still hungry.
Is it wrong that I'm still hungry? John?

14:17.320 --> 14:19.402
Shift change is in 10 minutes.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.288
You know, for the past week, you've been
pretty intense.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.285
Are you going to tell me what's going on?

14:26.800 --> 14:28.609
And don't tell me
it's because Oliver is back.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.649
Well, I'm not happy Oliver's back.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.968
Yeah, you weren't exactly
subtle about that.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.851
Just let it go, Laurel.

14:35.960 --> 14:39.123
No, because we don't keep secrets,
remember?

14:40.280 --> 14:43.090
John, what's going on?

14:45.360 --> 14:48.091
Remember last week,
when Oliver was telling us about Darhk?

14:49.280 --> 14:51.203
He said he had a hive of followers.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.771
An organization called
H.l.V.E. killed my brother.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.808
I didn't know.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.690
Do you think it's some
kind of coincidence?

15:01.960 --> 15:05.885
No. I've been looking into this
organization for two years now.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.645
<i>All dead ends.</i>

15:07.880 --> 15:11.123
But what I did manage to dig up tracks
with what we know about Darhk's Ghosts.

15:12.360 --> 15:13.691
They're H.l.V.E.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.011
Do Oliver and Felicity know?

15:17.360 --> 15:18.691
No.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.005
You've been investigating this for
two years and you haven't told anyone?

15:22.200 --> 15:23.531
This is a family thing, Laurel,

15:25.320 --> 15:27.687
I would think you of all people would
understand keeping secrets

15:27.880 --> 15:29.166
when it comes to the death of a sibling.

15:29.400 --> 15:30.811
I do.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.641
And because I do, I can tell you,
carrying a burden like that,

15:35.400 --> 15:37.084
it never ends in any way but bad.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.565
That was quite the show.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.207
False machine gun.
Impersonating a bodyguard.

15:51.400 --> 15:55.405
You've the flair for the dramatic,
Mr. Machin. I will give you that.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.927
Too bad it was all for nothing.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.202
Half of your fee has been
wired into your account.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.090
This isn't about money for me.

16:04.320 --> 16:07.085
I know. You came to me with promises.

16:07.560 --> 16:11.087
You wanted to impress yourself
to my organization, and you failed.

16:11.840 --> 16:17.882
I'm not done yet. Just give me more time.

16:18.880 --> 16:22.885
I will make sure that Jessica Danforth
does not run for mayor.

16:25.200 --> 16:29.569
Very well. However, a word of caution.

16:30.800 --> 16:34.088
I'm not sure how Rick Pinzolo runs his
operation, but H.l.V.E. does not believe

16:34.240 --> 16:36.527
in third chances. Good night.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.770
Spoke to Diggle.
No movement at the precinct.

16:49.960 --> 16:53.043
That's all right.
I may have some movement here.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.886
I noticed something tacky on the palm
print our guy left on the windshield.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.449
- Tacky?
- Like a residue.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.291
What kind?

17:02.160 --> 17:05.482
Cellulose.
Oh, except this formulation is special.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.290
The molecular structure's been patented.

17:07.480 --> 17:08.606
BY Who?

17:08.839 --> 17:10.126
Palmer Technologies.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.724
A subsidiary, actually. Palmer Paper.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.486
I had to shut down the mill a couple
months ago as a cost-cutting measure.

17:15.079 --> 17:16.491
Where's the paper mill?

17:26.319 --> 17:29.164
Hey, stay sharp.
He has some sort of electricity weapon.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.923
The man in the photo, have you seen him?

17:38.600 --> 17:40.489
I don't see much. I like my sleep.

17:41.280 --> 17:45.842
But that guy, he sees a lot. He deals
outta here. Does a lot of business.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.491
Hey, we need to ask you a few questions.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.011
Step off, freak.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.201
Have you seen this guy here?
I want a name.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.329
You masks, you think you're in charge.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.170
Yeah, well, maybe you were,
but not anymore.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.330
There are new masks in charge.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.324
I asked you. Have you seen this guy here?
Do you still wanna use your arm?

18:06.520 --> 18:08.010
Let him go!

18:08.160 --> 18:09.810
You still think you're in charge?

18:10.040 --> 18:12.805
Hey! Get out of here!

18:26.880 --> 18:28.405
I got an ID on our Mr. Creepy.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.529
I thought his fingerprints were
all screwed up.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.484
Mixed up. But I have an obsession
with jigsaw puzzles.

18:34.200 --> 18:37.204
Lonnie Machin. Part-time mob enforcer,
full-time crazy-pants.

18:37.760 --> 18:41.242
Done jobs for the Bertinellis,
the Triad, Rick Pinzolo...

18:41.920 --> 18:43.206
We're going to talk about this.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.921
We're going to have a conversation
about what just happened.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.361
What just happened was that guy had

18:47.600 --> 18:49.443
information and I was
trying to get it out of him!

18:49.720 --> 18:51.051
- You broke his arm.
- He was stalling!

18:51.240 --> 18:52.526
He was scared. Come here!

18:52.680 --> 18:53.727
What are you doing?

18:53.880 --> 18:56.406
I'll just show you something.
At the water-plant, you took down a Ghost.

18:56.600 --> 19:00.491
You could have done it with a very
simple disarming technique. Like this.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.722
Thea, that's not what you did.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.207
You went overboard

19:10.360 --> 19:15.048
with a series of techniques
designed to do one thing, cripple!

19:15.240 --> 19:17.527
Oliver!

19:27.400 --> 19:28.526
That's enough!

19:28.680 --> 19:30.682
- Come on! Come on!
- That's enough!

19:32.760 --> 19:34.000
Demonstration's over.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.611
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

19:43.440 --> 19:46.250
After Ra's hurt you,

19:48.760 --> 19:52.128
Malcolm warned me
not to take you to Nanda Parbat.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.210
He said that when people go in the Pit,

19:56.720 --> 19:58.290
they don't come out the same.

19:58.560 --> 20:01.450
And I didn't tell you because
I didn't wanna worry about you.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.563
You seemed normal, Thea.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.768
And I swear to God,
I thought everything was gonna be fine.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.643
And then you left. So you know what?

20:11.920 --> 20:15.811
It doesn't really qualify you to judge me,
or anyone else!

20:19.600 --> 20:23.764
What's going on?
What happened to Thea in Nanda Parbat?

20:26.160 --> 20:29.767
I did what I had to do to save my sister.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.324
That was six months ago.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.164
Why is the Pit only affecting her now?

20:34.600 --> 20:37.251
It's probably been showing up over time.
Subtly.

20:39.560 --> 20:40.925
So what do you want to do about it?

20:45.920 --> 20:47.684
You! Hey! Stay down!

20:48.920 --> 20:50.081
I guess you know what happened to Kenny.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.850
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Just shut up!

20:52.000 --> 20:55.004
That's a minefield, all right?
That's what killed your friend.

20:55.240 --> 20:56.651
And who the hell are you?

20:57.520 --> 20:58.851
My name is Oliver Queen.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.849
Three years ago, the yacht that I was on
went down in a storm.

21:03.080 --> 21:05.765
I washed up here. I survived.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.531
Let's take him to Reiter.
He'll know what to do with him.

21:15.640 --> 21:18.803
Wow. You look like someone who has
to fire a whole mess of people today.

21:19.160 --> 21:25.202
What? Oh, no. I mean, yes.
But this isn't about this.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.890
Not that firing a dozen people is going
to do much for my mood.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.530
Actually, it's two dozen.

21:30.840 --> 21:33.002
- What?
- The pages are double-sided.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.051
But there has to be another way.

21:37.280 --> 21:40.011
This many intelligent people in the
company, there has to be someone who...

21:41.200 --> 21:42.531
Ms. Smoak? Are you all right?

21:44.080 --> 21:45.411
Absolutely.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.243
- It's okay.
- What is?

21:51.440 --> 21:52.851
I'm on the list, aren't I?

21:53.560 --> 21:55.244
Yeah. I'm so sorry.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.282
It's okay. It means one less person that
you have to fire today, right?

22:00.360 --> 22:03.648
You know, actually, this is good news
in a way. My husband'll be thrilled.

22:04.760 --> 22:07.491
I mean, this way, we can take that trip
that he's been wanting to go on.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.889
Of course, I'll have to drive.

22:10.080 --> 22:12.367
You don't have to try and make me feel
better about this.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.684
About what? I sort of fired myself.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.164
Come to visit me in my confinement?

22:27.840 --> 22:29.251
I thought you could use some company.

22:29.560 --> 22:30.925
And a little, "I told you so"?

22:31.400 --> 22:33.209
Oh, I didn't bring it.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.680
You know, that being said,
it's not too late for you to drop out.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.566
And send what message?

22:38.880 --> 22:41.281
That on top of the city's other problems,
we give in to terrorism?

22:42.120 --> 22:43.360
The people here deserve better.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.124
They deserve someone to be brave for them.

22:46.520 --> 22:47.601
That's what the Green Arrow is for.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.290
He's not enough.

22:49.880 --> 22:53.123
Yes, the Green Arrow risks his life to
keep the people of the city safe,

22:54.640 --> 22:55.926
but who inspires them?

22:57.040 --> 22:59.646
You know, who works to make sure
that there's a city worth saving?

23:00.480 --> 23:03.643
Who's there to make Star City a place
that my daughter wants to call home?

23:04.600 --> 23:05.965
Where is Madison?

23:06.280 --> 23:09.284
Oh. Library. Poor kid has finals
so I sent her back to school.

23:10.720 --> 23:13.803
Don't worry. Captain Lance sent her with
more than enough cops to keep her safe.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.122
Maybe you should call her.

23:38.520 --> 23:45.529
To the man who took my daughter, please,
lam begging you. Please let my baby go.

23:48.120 --> 23:52.011
She's all I have. She's my whole world.

23:57.320 --> 23:59.448
Killed the officers escorting her
with some kinda weapon.

23:59.640 --> 24:02.530
Shot them up with five thousand volts,
slit their throats for good measure.

24:03.320 --> 24:04.890
His name is Lonnie Machin.

24:05.120 --> 24:06.610
Do I even want to know
how you got that intel?

24:06.840 --> 24:10.606
You can't do this alone. You know that.
Now, two of your guys are down.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.490
Now let us help.

24:17.480 --> 24:18.686
What is this place?

24:18.880 --> 24:20.120
Over there.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.042
Baron, this guy says he's...

24:26.280 --> 24:29.329
Oliver Queen. You don't recognize him?

24:29.520 --> 24:34.367
This man's a minor celebrity
on the other side of the world.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.800
You're supposed to be dead.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.205
Nearly was.

24:39.360 --> 24:40.850
Thank you for rescuing me.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.848
I'm sorry, but we're not rescuing you.

24:44.560 --> 24:45.925
The first thing you do once you get home

24:46.160 --> 24:47.400
is tell people what
it is we're doing here.

24:48.240 --> 24:49.480
I don't know what you're doing here.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.365
Be that as it may, I can't send you home.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.210
Not right now.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.851
Good news, though,
I've no reason to kill you.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.046
So what are you gonna do to me?

25:01.720 --> 25:03.006
Good question.

25:03.240 --> 25:06.210
You've survived three years here.
All alone.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.206
That requires fortitude, intelligence.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.885
Qualities that are of use to me.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.404
As it happens, one of my men
stepped on a land mine.

25:18.280 --> 25:19.611
How would you like his job?

25:30.080 --> 25:31.206
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

25:31.400 --> 25:35.371
What did you do?
Where is Jessica Danforth's daughter?

25:40.400 --> 25:42.050
Did you catch the news earlier?

25:42.640 --> 25:45.041
Ms. Danforth,
begging for her daughter's life.

25:45.760 --> 25:46.966
She'll do anything to get her back.

25:47.120 --> 25:51.330
Or not do anything. Like run for mayor.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.245
All I have to do is make a phone call.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.722
Now I see why Rick Pinzolo banished you.

25:58.320 --> 26:01.085
You're unaware that there are lines
one does not cross.

26:05.720 --> 26:08.803
I met one of your Ghosts.

26:09.960 --> 26:13.965
After I took his tooth, we had an
interesting conversation about H.l.V.E.

26:15.280 --> 26:17.760
I wasn't led to believe
you respected lines.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.406
I respect order, Mr. Machin.

26:20.640 --> 26:24.167
Discipline. Precision. You are sloppy.

26:24.920 --> 26:29.642
All you represent is anarchy. You made
a mess. I suggest you clean it up.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.765
Either way, our relationship is concluded.

26:33.160 --> 26:35.367
Wait. You can't.

26:36.840 --> 26:39.366
You know your hand is on me?

26:43.920 --> 26:45.331
Clean it up.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.280
<i>To the man who took my daughter,</i>

26:56.440 --> 26:57.726
<i>please,</i>

26:57.960 --> 26:59.007
<i>"I am begging Yo" -</i>

26:59.160 --> 27:00.810
That's heartbreaking.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.240
<i>Please let my baby go.</i>

27:03.800 --> 27:05.040
Hey-

27:06.760 --> 27:08.000
Are you okay?

27:09.760 --> 27:12.764
Just can't stand watching
Jessica go through that.

27:13.880 --> 27:17.168
I feel like that's what my mom felt like
when Slade Wilson abducted me.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.642
That's not what you asked, though. Um...

27:23.400 --> 27:24.640
I'm fine.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.486
Well, you could have fooled me.

27:29.160 --> 27:30.207
Thea.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.485
What happened to you on Nanda Parbat?

27:34.160 --> 27:35.571
Ollie didn't tell you?

27:35.760 --> 27:36.886
It's Ollie.

27:37.080 --> 27:40.004
I guess I really am his sister
since I didn't tell you either.

27:42.560 --> 27:45.803
I just didn't want to relive it.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.686
Relive what?

27:50.320 --> 27:51.651
Ra's, he...

27:55.760 --> 27:59.207
He killed me.

27:59.440 --> 28:02.046
Or almost did.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.284
Ollie said that it was pretty bad.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.211
And then Ra's

28:08.400 --> 28:11.085
offered to use something...

28:11.560 --> 28:13.130
I don't know, to bring me back.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.648
Something he calls a "Lazarus Pit."

28:17.640 --> 28:19.688
Wait, so what's happening to you now is...

28:20.440 --> 28:23.444
is a side-effect from this Pit?

28:23.920 --> 28:26.605
And Malcolm tried to warn Ollie,
lguess, buthe

28:28.480 --> 28:29.766
didn't listen.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.890
No, of course he didn't.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.009
He would do anything to save his sister.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.531
I swear, if there is even
a scratch on that girl, so help me...

28:42.720 --> 28:44.370
I'm afraid that is out of my control.

28:44.560 --> 28:48.360
Yeah, well, so am I. lam out.
Lam all the way out!

28:48.560 --> 28:52.246
Well, I suppose you need a reminder
that Madison Danforth is not the only

28:52.640 --> 28:54.324
vulnerable daughter in this city.

28:56.400 --> 29:00.246
You stay the hell away from my daughter,
you son of a bitch!

29:01.880 --> 29:03.120
Language.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.001
What is this?

29:07.200 --> 29:08.725
The location of the Danforth girl.

29:09.560 --> 29:12.882
My sincere threat
against your daughter notwithstanding,

29:13.080 --> 29:14.320
this abduction lacks taste.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.809
The next time we meet, and make
no mistake, there will be a next time,

29:19.240 --> 29:21.447
remember to mind your tone.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.166
Any news?

29:30.360 --> 29:32.328
Only the bad kind.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.329
Hey, we're going catch this guy.

29:34.520 --> 29:36.090
Yeah. And when we do,
there'll be another one waiting for us.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.725
And another. And another.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.725
It's like the most depressing game
of Whack-A-Mole ever.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.729
Can't say we didn't know
what we were getting into.

29:44.560 --> 29:45.607
Or back into.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.804
When we decided to stay in Starling,

29:50.080 --> 29:51.764
I mean, Star City,

29:51.960 --> 29:53.769
I was excited.
I thought it meant a new beginning.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.611
And now, we've only been back a week,
John,

29:56.800 --> 29:58.484
still mad at you, Thea's gone Pit-crazy.

29:58.680 --> 30:00.808
I've spent the last two days
putting people out of work.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.809
If you think that we made a mistake,
we didn't.

30:04.160 --> 30:06.003
Nothing worthwhile ever comes easy.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.765
We said that we're going
to do things differently.

30:08.960 --> 30:12.646
We just need time to figure out how.

30:20.280 --> 30:21.327
Captain.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.403
Heavy Heavy Club, Fourth and Pierce.

30:23.600 --> 30:24.886
<i>What about it?</i>

30:25.080 --> 30:27.731
It's where Lonnie Machin is
holding Jessica Danforth's daughter.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.641
You said you're doing things
differently now?

30:31.840 --> 30:33.490
Here's your chance to prove it.

30:43.840 --> 30:47.890
Sorry to leave you hanging.
I had a meeting. Didn't go well.

30:48.360 --> 30:51.409
Turns out, I can't sit
at the cool kids' table.

30:52.280 --> 30:55.682
When trillions and trillions of
molecules exploded from a pinhead,

30:55.920 --> 30:58.207
were there rules dictating how
to establish a universe?

30:59.760 --> 31:01.046
No.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.488
They found their way through the chaos.

31:05.680 --> 31:09.287
Please, you can still let me go. Please!

31:11.240 --> 31:15.848
Only if you promise not to tell
anybody about me.

31:16.280 --> 31:18.726
Okay. Please.

31:24.720 --> 31:27.690
Pinky swear?

31:32.400 --> 31:33.640
I changed my mind.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.286
My God!

31:35.800 --> 31:37.609
The things I'm about to do to you...

31:45.240 --> 31:46.605
Something wrong with the front door?

31:46.840 --> 31:48.763
Get away from the girl.

31:48.960 --> 31:52.362
Could you come back in an hour?
We were just getting started.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.640
Let's get her down.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.047
Felicity.

32:09.280 --> 32:12.329
So now, madman du jour knows
you're working with a Felicity.

32:12.520 --> 32:13.726
This is why I need a codename.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.331
We have Madison, but he's split.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.082
No movement outside the club.
He must still be in there with you.

32:19.280 --> 32:20.361
She needs medical attention.

32:20.560 --> 32:22.801
Get her to safety. We've got this.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.721
Hey, can you handle this?

32:27.600 --> 32:28.886
I'm good.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.409
(%GR0ANs)
- Speedy!

33:45.600 --> 33:47.807
Speedy, don't!

34:23.120 --> 34:24.884
- Baby!
- Mom!

34:25.600 --> 34:28.080
- Baby!
- Mom!

34:29.000 --> 34:30.047
My baby!

34:30.199 --> 34:32.043
I'm okay. I'm okay.

34:33.520 --> 34:36.649
Madison, are you all right?

34:37.239 --> 34:38.730
Yeah, bumps and bruises.

34:38.920 --> 34:40.763
Probably the world's worst
case of insomnia.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.728
I'm really sorry, but I got
an army of reporters out there

34:43.920 --> 34:45.409
and they wanna know
if you want to make a statement.

34:46.639 --> 34:47.721
Yes. I'll be out in a few minutes.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.001
You don't have to do that tonight.

34:49.199 --> 34:52.283
Yes, I do. Oliver, I have to tell them
what I've decided.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.884
I have to tell them
I'm withdrawing my candidacy.

34:58.880 --> 35:00.325
I'm not running for mayor.

35:02.320 --> 35:03.560
Come on.

35:10.600 --> 35:11.886
Thank you for trusting me.

35:12.080 --> 35:14.321
You weren't kidding about
doing things differently, were you?

35:15.120 --> 35:17.441
Instead of pin cushioning guys,
now you're burning them alive?

35:17.600 --> 35:18.647
Yeah, Captain...

35:18.840 --> 35:20.285
You're lucky Major is on his way to
Starling General,

35:20.480 --> 35:22.244
or I would be booking you for murder.

35:24.800 --> 35:27.041
Just so you're clear
where we stand with each other.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.729
This man needs some water.
Did you hear me?

35:43.920 --> 35:46.651
Yeah, I heard. Get back to work!

35:46.840 --> 35:50.526
What are you going to do when all your
workers are dead from heat stroke?

35:51.280 --> 35:52.930
Not your concern.

35:53.120 --> 35:56.602
Like the man said, get back to work!

36:02.960 --> 36:04.007
Ms. Smoak,

36:04.160 --> 36:06.686
what's this we're hearing about
you halting the workforce reduction?

36:06.880 --> 36:08.086
I thought we agreed...

36:08.280 --> 36:10.806
You talked and I listened.
I wouldn't hardly call that an agreement.

36:11.680 --> 36:14.126
With that said,
I did get around to firing a few people.

36:14.320 --> 36:15.731
They've all been hired back, BTW.

36:15.920 --> 36:17.046
And one of them reminded me that

36:17.240 --> 36:19.129
Ray Palmer never would
have approved of this.

36:19.360 --> 36:22.762
Ray Palmer is dead.
And this company will be too, unless...

36:22.960 --> 36:25.008
I am going to stop you right there.

36:25.240 --> 36:28.608
I'm sorry, Ms. Smoak,
you asked to see me. Uh...

36:30.000 --> 36:31.161
I think there's been a mistake.

36:31.360 --> 36:32.885
No. Actually, you have perfect timing.

36:33.120 --> 36:35.088
I was just about to tell
Mr. Dennis about your project.

36:35.960 --> 36:39.521
After I fired Mr. Holt, I had the
opportunity to review his active projects.

36:39.720 --> 36:41.165
Turns out he is working
on something that is going to

36:41.360 --> 36:43.522
revolutionize technology
and save this company.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.845
Neither of which he can do with
a reduced workforce supporting him.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.210
Intriguing. So what's this revolutionary
technology, Mr. Holt?

36:53.480 --> 36:55.847
- Uh... It's...
- That is proprietary.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.201
But I can assure you,
it will astonish the world.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.962
Our annual shareholder's meeting
is in six months.

37:05.520 --> 37:08.683
Present it there. Astonish us.

37:10.200 --> 37:11.645
Oh, we will.

37:17.080 --> 37:20.323
You don't even have an idea for some
"world-astonishing" technology, do you?

37:20.480 --> 37:22.528
Nope. But I'm betting that you do.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.690
Pretty bold move, Ms. Smoak.

37:25.840 --> 37:28.047
Yeah, well, I'm trying to do things
a little differently.

37:34.160 --> 37:40.406
Hello. Hey! How are you?

37:42.720 --> 37:45.849
I guess I was wrong when I told you
not to worry about me.

37:46.240 --> 37:48.049
Right or wrong, I'm still gonna worry.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.927
It's right at the top of the
big brotherjob description.

37:53.720 --> 37:58.521
Thea. I should have told you
about the Pit immediately.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.206
That was the old me.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.603
And who are you now?

38:05.040 --> 38:06.724
Ollie 2.0?

38:06.920 --> 38:08.365
No. I'm more like

38:09.240 --> 38:11.891
Ollie 1.0
who's trying to do things differently.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.243
<i>Look, whatever you are going through,</i>

38:15.080 --> 38:17.447
we will get through it together.

38:18.400 --> 38:23.930
I thought Thea could use some time out of
town. A spa getaway to clear her head.

38:25.280 --> 38:27.726
As long as it's not near any hot tubs.

38:27.880 --> 38:30.406
'Cause that's what got me
in this situation.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.726
I think it's a good idea.

38:31.880 --> 38:34.565
Can you and John handle things
while we're away?

38:34.760 --> 38:37.127
Yeah. As long as we don't
kill each other first.

38:37.960 --> 38:39.246
Bye.

38:41.240 --> 38:45.086
I'm kidding, by the way.
We'll be fine. Probably.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.286
Take care of her, okay?

38:47.640 --> 38:48.926
Okay.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.244
I like a spa as much as anybody, but I

38:55.440 --> 38:57.249
think we both know whatever is going on

38:57.480 --> 39:00.086
with me will not be fixed
with a mani-pedi.

39:03.080 --> 39:05.811
That's why we're not going to the spa.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.080
We're going to Nanda Parbat.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.764
Thea, whatever is going on with you,

39:12.680 --> 39:13.920
the League, they'll know what to do.

39:15.840 --> 39:18.286
Why are we not telling my brother?

39:19.440 --> 39:23.161
Because you're not the only reason
for us going to Nanda Parbat.

39:31.840 --> 39:32.887
What happened?

39:33.040 --> 39:34.485
The ambulance didn't make it to
Starling General.

39:34.720 --> 39:35.960
We tried to get the paramedics
on the radio,

39:36.120 --> 39:38.487
and then we got a 911 call reporting this.

39:38.640 --> 39:41.564
Machin, he...

39:43.200 --> 39:45.646
I don't really know how to describe
what he did to them.

39:53.320 --> 39:54.810
I'm not sure what that symbol means.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.485
It means "anarchy."

40:02.640 --> 40:03.880
Hello!

40:04.080 --> 40:05.320
Hey, I'm out here.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.484
You look happy.

40:08.480 --> 40:10.323
Don't tell me you started
enjoying firing people?

40:10.640 --> 40:12.165
No more firing.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.046
Good.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.171
I figured out another way.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.685
Wow. Maybe you could share
your secret with me.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.241
Doing things differently
is what I promised myself.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.525
You are doing things differently.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.609
Not different enough, apparently.

40:32.400 --> 40:36.564
Both Lance and Jessica Danforth
said something to me

40:36.880 --> 40:40.851
about this city needing something
that the Green Arrow can't offer.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.850
A decent sushi restaurant?

40:47.880 --> 40:51.521
Hope. Inspiration.

40:54.200 --> 40:58.046
Someone who can do things in the light,
who isn't afraid and...

41:01.040 --> 41:03.566
Someone who can protect himself.

41:05.200 --> 41:07.202
- Felicity.
- Mmm?

41:09.760 --> 41:11.569
I'm going to run for mayor.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.765
Are you sure you want to do this?

42:28.000 --> 42:29.001
English - SDH
