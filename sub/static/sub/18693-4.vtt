00:06.110 --> 00:07.939
[Isabelle] Previously
on Shadowhunters...

00:08.029 --> 00:10.240
- Mom.
- [sighs] My sweet girl.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.530
- What does this have to do with me?
- Blood.

00:12.620 --> 00:16.790
See, that's why you want Clary
and that is why you always will.

00:17.870 --> 00:19.470
Let's discuss the vampire
den, shall we?

00:19.500 --> 00:22.130
Now, because of you,
I'm being called in to answer for it.

00:22.210 --> 00:24.180
Find Camille, or die trying.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.236
You're the only one I know who
knows her as well as Raphael.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.840
I know her better.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.340
This helps me how?

00:29.430 --> 00:32.350
If Camille had that snake guarding
it, it must be precious to her.

00:32.430 --> 00:34.980
If you can't help him,
then you need to go.

00:35.060 --> 00:36.560
[grunts]

00:38.270 --> 00:41.110
Stop. We need to get Alec out of
here, but this isn't helping.

00:41.190 --> 00:43.320
Please don't leave me, Alec.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.916
[Aldertree] Jace Wayland! You are
hereby sentenced to the City of Bones

00:45.940 --> 00:48.100
to await trial for the
charge of high treason,

00:48.190 --> 00:50.900
and aiding Valentine in
the war against the Clave.

01:08.460 --> 01:09.630
[sighs]

01:14.720 --> 01:16.470

01:37.160 --> 01:38.620
[wailing in distance]

01:48.300 --> 01:49.930
[wailing continues]

02:01.980 --> 02:04.940
What is your business
here, Shadowhunter?

02:07.270 --> 02:08.770
I need to see Jace Wayland.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.410
[crying in distance]

02:23.710 --> 02:25.250
[screaming in distance]

02:28.170 --> 02:29.316
- [gasps]
- Get me out of here.

02:29.340 --> 02:31.010
Please...

02:31.090 --> 02:33.350
[Enoch] Pay no heed
to their desperation.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.420
They all deserve to be here.

02:35.510 --> 02:39.100
Infractions against the
Clave do not go unpunished.

02:48.020 --> 02:49.480
Jace.

02:50.690 --> 02:52.980
[Jace] You shouldn't have come here.
Take her out.

02:53.070 --> 02:54.280
No.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.440
I'm not going anywhere...

02:57.910 --> 03:00.080
unless I know you're
gonna be okay.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.210
Is Alec safe? Is he all right?

03:05.290 --> 03:06.630
He's fine.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.750
Jace, I feel terrible.

03:10.340 --> 03:11.510
You're here because of me.

03:11.590 --> 03:15.600
- If I hadn't fallen under Dot's spell...
- You're not what put me here, Clary.

03:15.670 --> 03:16.920
I have to pay for my actions.

03:17.510 --> 03:19.560
[Clary] Not by yourself.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.140
What can I do to help?

03:25.230 --> 03:28.070
Please, tell me.
I will do anything.

03:31.980 --> 03:33.480
You can stay away from me.

03:33.570 --> 03:34.990
What?

03:35.070 --> 03:38.160
No matter what happens,
never come near me again.

03:39.740 --> 03:41.110
Jace,
what are you talking about?

03:41.200 --> 03:42.660
You're my family.

03:45.250 --> 03:47.130
I am Valentine's weapon.

03:48.160 --> 03:51.500
You think he's just gonna let me go?
He knows that you... [sighs]

03:53.840 --> 03:55.640
You're my weakness.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.460
If I ever get out of here,
he'll come after you again.

03:59.550 --> 04:01.340
Let him.

04:01.430 --> 04:03.890
I'm not afraid.
We'll fight him off together.

04:06.850 --> 04:09.390
There is no together for you and
me, Clary.

04:11.060 --> 04:12.430
There never can be.

04:16.820 --> 04:17.870
Jace...

04:18.610 --> 04:20.360
- We're done here.
- No.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.660
Jace, please, don't do this.
Jace!

04:23.740 --> 04:25.070
Bye, Clary.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.160
No, Jace! No!

04:30.040 --> 04:31.160
Jace!

04:53.770 --> 04:55.390
How'd it go with Aldertree?

04:55.480 --> 04:57.440
Well, the man didn't disappoint.

04:57.530 --> 05:00.330
In his own charming,
inimitable way,

05:00.400 --> 05:02.280
he informed me that I
will indeed be punished,

05:02.360 --> 05:05.780
but the form of punishment
is yet to be decided.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.420
All for trying to save my life.

05:08.790 --> 05:11.130
Jace may have been the
one who pulled me out,

05:11.210 --> 05:13.210
but I did feel you there.

05:13.290 --> 05:16.960
And it did make a difference.
So... thank you.

05:18.420 --> 05:20.130
Thank you for not dying on me.

05:23.260 --> 05:24.810
[stammers] How is Jace?

05:24.890 --> 05:26.560
He won't be gone long.

05:26.640 --> 05:29.160
Once his hand touches the Soul-Sword,
the truth will come out...

05:29.680 --> 05:32.560
and prove that he's never
been on Valentine's side.

05:35.690 --> 05:41.160
Look, um, I know that with
everything that's been going on, I...

05:42.400 --> 05:44.650
[stammers] We haven't
had a chance to...

05:46.370 --> 05:48.250
Go on that first
date we never had?

05:48.330 --> 05:49.460
Right, yes.

05:50.750 --> 05:54.420
I know a place in SoHo that has the
best lamb kebab this side of Marrakesh.

05:54.500 --> 05:58.000
[gasps] Or we can Portal to Marrakesh.
You hungry?

05:58.090 --> 05:59.260
Starving.

05:59.340 --> 06:00.820
- [chuckles softly]
- [Raj] Hey, Alec.

06:02.670 --> 06:04.880
Demon briefing in the ops center.
All hands on deck.

06:04.970 --> 06:08.520
My dear Raj... you look well.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.220
Rain check?

06:14.310 --> 06:16.930
Yes, yeah.
[stammers] Is that okay?

06:17.020 --> 06:18.690
You go battle your demons.

06:21.230 --> 06:22.810
I'll go battle mine.

06:25.950 --> 06:28.000
Oh, Clary.
I've been looking all over for you.

06:28.070 --> 06:30.200
I heard you went to see Jace.
Is he all right?

06:30.290 --> 06:32.880
He's locked up in the City of Bones.
How do you think he's doing?

06:33.620 --> 06:35.740
Look, we're late for this
briefing, so can we just...

06:35.830 --> 06:37.950
Clary, wait.
There's something I have to tell you.

06:39.550 --> 06:42.430
The Clave is
reassigning me to Idris.

06:43.380 --> 06:44.500
What?

06:47.510 --> 06:49.380
[scoffs] Why?

06:50.510 --> 06:52.720
I'm Valentine's ex-wife.

06:53.600 --> 06:57.970
I hid the Cup for 18 years.
They're... testing my loyalty.

06:58.060 --> 07:01.350
But the Clave has to know that
you're not on Valentine's side.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.520
Just tell them you'll
prove your loyalty here.

07:03.610 --> 07:06.070
I wish it were up to me.

07:06.150 --> 07:09.570
So it's either I go to
Idris, or I run. And...

07:10.450 --> 07:12.070
I've done enough running.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.200
But I just got you back.

07:14.290 --> 07:15.500
I know.

07:16.790 --> 07:18.660
That's why I want
you to come with me.

07:20.090 --> 07:21.550
Move to Idris?

07:22.670 --> 07:26.750
I know it's a big change, but I could
finally show you where you come from.

07:27.630 --> 07:31.130
And we'd have a fresh start...
together.

07:32.680 --> 07:33.866
[Isabelle] Demon
attack downtown.

07:33.890 --> 07:36.760
- One mundane dead.
- And we don't have Jace, so...

07:36.850 --> 07:38.350
you're with us.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.860
Wait. You want me on your team?

07:40.940 --> 07:43.450
It's not my first choice,
but we're a man down,

07:43.520 --> 07:45.940
and everyone else is on patrol.
Gear up.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.610
We got a 10-54.
I don't see a dead body, though.

07:53.700 --> 07:56.120
[Luke] Nothing to see.
It's a false alarm.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.870
Just some dumbass
kids pulling a prank.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.840
- All right, you have a good night, huh?
- You, too.

08:12.930 --> 08:14.980
Well, this is one nasty demon.

08:15.060 --> 08:16.650
Punched a hole right
through his chest.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.230
With that kind of strength,
I doubt it's done yet.

08:19.310 --> 08:20.520
Nothing in the immediate area.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.126
We're taking the body
back to the Institute.

08:22.150 --> 08:24.246
I'll run some tests to see what
kind of demon we're dealing with.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.810
Clary and I will
widen the perimeter.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.980
Hey, Fray! We got a demon to hunt.
Come on.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.250
Most important thing.
Don't slow me down.

08:35.330 --> 08:38.210
You slow me down,
you get us both killed.

08:38.289 --> 08:39.710
Sounds reasonable.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.049
- [rune searing]
- What's this for?

08:43.130 --> 08:45.010
Lets you see the
demon's heat signature.

08:46.670 --> 08:48.040
[Clary] Whoa.

08:49.010 --> 08:51.850
First time can be sensory overload.
The trick is to focus.

08:51.930 --> 08:54.696
Try to filter out everything unimportant,
hone in on the heat signature.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.340
Yeah, I'm honing.
I'm just not seeing anything.

08:57.430 --> 08:59.600
- [Alec] Patience.
- Easy for you to say.

09:00.730 --> 09:03.786
For someone who hasn't been training her
whole life, this stuff is impossible.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.640
- Impossible just means try again.
- [scoffs]

09:05.730 --> 09:08.930
Not that you have to worry about all that.
You'll be outta the field soon enough.

09:10.110 --> 09:11.940
You're going to Idris.

09:12.030 --> 09:14.030
Wow, news travels fast.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.210
[sighs deeply] But I
haven't decided yet,

09:16.280 --> 09:19.240
so don't get too excited about
throwing me a going away party.

09:19.330 --> 09:21.500
Honestly, I think you'll like Idris.
It's amazing.

09:21.580 --> 09:22.620
Yeah?

09:22.710 --> 09:25.186
I bet that it'd be pretty amazing
to get me out of your hair, huh?

09:25.210 --> 09:26.830
I didn't say that. You did.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.730
Mr. Santiago...

09:36.810 --> 09:37.980
thank you for coming in.

09:38.060 --> 09:39.940
Not like I had much of a choice.

09:42.230 --> 09:45.150
Believe me, I was hoping to resolve
our little vampire den dilemma

09:45.230 --> 09:46.390
without dragging you in here.

09:47.980 --> 09:51.770
But last night, one of my team
raided another one in Ocean Hill.

09:51.860 --> 09:55.440
Fourteen mundanes drained.
Three of them children.

09:55.530 --> 09:56.900
[sighs heavily]

09:56.990 --> 10:00.700
Camille at work.
She's always had a thing for kids.

10:00.790 --> 10:03.250
It has nothing to
do with my clan.

10:03.330 --> 10:07.410
Unfortunately, we've reached the limit
on kicking the can down the road.

10:07.500 --> 10:11.500
If you want to prove your innocence,
deliver Miss Belcourt to the Clave.

10:11.590 --> 10:13.220
You think I haven't been trying?

10:14.220 --> 10:16.980
I want to believe
you, Mr. Santiago,

10:17.050 --> 10:19.300
but sadly... [sighs]

10:19.390 --> 10:21.020
I'm not sure I do.

10:22.350 --> 10:26.180
Based on your long list of missteps
over the past seven decades,

10:26.270 --> 10:29.440
it seems you have a hard
time controlling your urges.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.770
All unfortunate
misunderstandings.

10:33.320 --> 10:37.410
But I told you...
I had nothing to do with those feedings.

10:37.490 --> 10:39.450
It must've been Camille.

10:39.530 --> 10:42.700
- Where is she now?
- I told you, I don't know.

10:42.790 --> 10:46.590
And if I did, I'd go over there
and find her myself and stop her.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.540
What a hero you are, Raphael.

10:52.710 --> 10:55.000
- [remote beeps]
- [grunting]

10:56.430 --> 10:58.270
What are you doing?

10:58.340 --> 11:00.220
Something new from the
Clave R&D department.

11:01.140 --> 11:04.730
To convince our vampire
friends to cooperate.

11:04.810 --> 11:06.600
[breathing heavily and grunting]

11:07.980 --> 11:10.200
Concentrated UV rays.

11:11.860 --> 11:13.200
Even more intense than sunlight.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.620
[continues grunting]

11:21.330 --> 11:22.750
[screams]

11:22.830 --> 11:23.830
Stop!

11:24.830 --> 11:27.870
- Where's Camille?
- I told you. I don't know.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.300
[panting] You can't
get away with this.

11:30.380 --> 11:32.590
Torturing Downworlders is
a breach of the Accords.

11:32.670 --> 11:35.420
We are aware of our
restrictions on torture.

11:35.510 --> 11:37.810
We call this motivation.

11:37.880 --> 11:38.920
[Raphael grunts]

11:42.810 --> 11:44.730
[screams]

11:50.520 --> 11:52.560
[hammering]

12:01.280 --> 12:03.530
Are you kidding?
Not even a dent?

12:05.580 --> 12:06.580
[sighs]

12:11.630 --> 12:13.260
[grunts]

12:13.340 --> 12:14.930
[cell phone ringing]

12:18.550 --> 12:20.140
Hey, Mom. What's up?

12:20.220 --> 12:22.980
Dinner tomorrow. Eight o'clock.
Don't disappoint me.

12:23.050 --> 12:24.866
You sound just like Grandma,
except with more guilt.

12:24.890 --> 12:27.260
[panting] If that's
even possible.

12:27.350 --> 12:28.996
Your sister is coming
home for the weekend,

12:29.020 --> 12:31.496
and I think it would be a good
time for us to all get together.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.390
What do you feel like?
Ribs or burgers?

12:34.480 --> 12:36.160
I'm actually kind of
on a liquid diet now.

12:36.230 --> 12:37.860
What? One of those cleanses?

12:37.940 --> 12:39.440
That's why you look so anemic.

12:39.530 --> 12:41.796
Come on. When was the last time
we had a nice family dinner?

12:41.820 --> 12:44.490
Look, Mom, I...
I really want to come, it's just...

12:44.580 --> 12:46.386
my manager has me on this
really tight deadline

12:46.410 --> 12:49.700
and I have to find this female
singer for one of our gigs.

12:49.790 --> 12:52.260
I am sure Raphael
will understand.

12:52.330 --> 12:54.160
Yeah, well,
you don't know him like I do.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.210
But I know what
family means to you.

12:57.880 --> 13:01.170
- Yeah, you're right. I'll be there.
- [cell phone beeps]

13:03.390 --> 13:05.100
[screaming in distance]

13:07.520 --> 13:08.850
Clary...

13:08.930 --> 13:12.430
I know you said to stay away, but...
sorry, I can't.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.730
I can't be away from you.

13:14.810 --> 13:17.020
Why can't you understand?
You being near me

13:17.110 --> 13:19.490
and reminding me every
second of every day

13:19.570 --> 13:22.740
- what I want, but I can't have.
- We'll figure it out.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.960
Don't be afraid.

13:28.540 --> 13:29.710
No.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.550
Be afraid.

13:33.170 --> 13:34.590
[gasps]

13:37.130 --> 13:38.760
[inhales sharply] Clary!

13:38.840 --> 13:41.050
- [panting]
- [Hodge] Jace?

13:45.010 --> 13:46.340
Are you okay?

13:48.390 --> 13:50.150
Hodge?

13:50.230 --> 13:51.440
[Hodge] Try not to sleep.

13:52.810 --> 13:55.770
The Silent Brothers
use mind control

13:55.860 --> 13:58.900
to haunt you with nightmares
of those you've hurt the most.

14:00.110 --> 14:01.980
You must never sleep.

14:02.070 --> 14:03.360
[chuckles softly]

14:04.740 --> 14:06.290
You were right to take my
hand, Jace.

14:07.780 --> 14:10.990
I never should have given
the Cup to Valentine.

14:12.210 --> 14:14.550
Maybe someday you'll forgive me.

14:15.540 --> 14:19.460
I don't believe in forgiveness, Hodge.
I just stand by my actions, good or bad,

14:19.550 --> 14:21.640
and I accept the consequences.

14:21.710 --> 14:23.790
Unmerciful to the bone.

14:25.260 --> 14:27.090
That's what's always
made you the best.

14:29.010 --> 14:30.340
But this place...

14:31.770 --> 14:34.690
it'll bleed every ounce
of defiance out of you.

14:35.850 --> 14:37.680
I'm nothing like you.

14:37.770 --> 14:40.650
They want me to bend,
they can die trying.

14:42.360 --> 14:43.770
Wait until your trial.

14:44.990 --> 14:46.790
After what they do to you...

14:48.990 --> 14:50.450
you will be like me.

14:59.130 --> 15:00.300
Alec...

15:13.520 --> 15:14.770
[Clary gasps]

15:18.690 --> 15:20.400
[girl breathing shakily]

15:23.070 --> 15:24.410
[shuddering]

15:25.320 --> 15:27.860
What happened? Who are you?

15:27.950 --> 15:30.556
- It's okay. We're here to help.
- It's a classic possession hangover.

15:30.580 --> 15:33.920
Once the demon leaves the body,
they have no memory of what they did.

15:33.990 --> 15:36.160
- [shuddering] Is this blood?
- Just try to keep calm.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.960
[Clary] Hey,
don't look at your hand, okay?

15:38.040 --> 15:41.250
- Just look at me.
- [gasping] I don't understand.

15:42.170 --> 15:43.500
What's going on?

15:43.590 --> 15:47.890
I know nothing makes sense right now.
But I'm going to help you.

15:49.260 --> 15:50.470
I promise.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.840
- [continues breathing heavily]
- Okay?

15:56.930 --> 15:58.810
[Luke] As if you haven't
been through enough,

15:58.890 --> 16:00.980
now the Clave wants to
rip your family apart?

16:01.060 --> 16:03.560
- I'm talking to Aldertree.
- It's not his call.

16:03.650 --> 16:06.240
The transfer orders
came from the Council.

16:08.030 --> 16:09.030
Then I'm going with you.

16:10.530 --> 16:11.820
Absolutely not.

16:11.910 --> 16:15.210
For 18 years,
you've put Clary and me first.

16:15.290 --> 16:16.790
This is my cross to bear.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.420
That's not how this works.

16:22.340 --> 16:23.630
When Valentine took you,

16:23.710 --> 16:27.590
I promised myself it was the last
time I'd ever be without you.

16:28.170 --> 16:30.300
But you hate Idris.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.060
And what about your life here?

16:32.640 --> 16:35.310
Your work. The pack...

16:35.390 --> 16:37.350
It'll be hard to leave behind.

16:38.600 --> 16:42.100
But I'm a stubborn man...
and I know what I want.

16:53.910 --> 16:54.960
[doorbell rings]

16:55.030 --> 16:56.240
[Magnus] Coming!

17:01.710 --> 17:03.130
Oh, Raphael.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.329
I didn't know where else to go.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.970
[grunts]

17:08.880 --> 17:11.000
Oh, my poor boy.

17:12.089 --> 17:14.630
Everything's gonna be all right.
I'm going to take care of you.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.050
- Come in.
- [breathing heavily]

17:18.060 --> 17:19.400
Take him down to the morgue.

17:19.480 --> 17:22.165
And call as soon as you identify
what kind of demon we're looking for.

17:22.190 --> 17:25.700
Until Victor comes back from the
trial, I'm running point on this one.

17:28.610 --> 17:29.620
Lydia...

17:30.740 --> 17:32.950
[sighs] Have you heard
anything about Jace?

17:33.030 --> 17:36.030
I know you're worried,
but I'm still waiting, just like you.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.820
Except I'm the one
who put him there.

17:38.910 --> 17:40.556
If I didn't make that
deal with Aldertree...

17:40.580 --> 17:44.080
Jace would've been torn apart by
wolves, and Alec would be dead.

17:44.170 --> 17:45.670
You did what you had to do.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.620
Wow, that guy's
heart is obliterated.

17:47.710 --> 17:49.460
And I thought I was
having a rough weekend.

17:49.550 --> 17:51.300
Show some respect for the dead.

17:51.380 --> 17:53.840
I'm just saying,
I've been in his shoes before.

17:53.930 --> 17:56.020
Except my demon's
name was Kathy.

17:56.100 --> 17:58.116
You know, you might want
to cut back on the smartass

17:58.140 --> 18:00.150
after getting
manhandled by a warlock.

18:01.350 --> 18:02.670
Let me know if
you find anything.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.076
[Raj] Wow,
who died and made her queen?

18:05.100 --> 18:07.900
You keep shooting your mouth off,
you're gonna end up like that corpse.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.700
[chuckles]

18:25.120 --> 18:28.910
Aldertree knows how I took you in.
How you're like a son to me.

18:29.590 --> 18:31.760
- That's why he did this.
- He was looking for Camille.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.430
And punishing me
at the same time.

18:35.510 --> 18:39.010
So, can you help me deliver
Camille to the Clave?

18:40.930 --> 18:43.680
- Raphael...
- I know it's a lot to ask.

18:43.770 --> 18:45.860
Which is why I
haven't until now.

18:47.100 --> 18:49.520
Aldertree gave me 12
hours to deliver her,

18:49.610 --> 18:51.700
or he'll burn me alive
along with my entire clan.

18:54.530 --> 18:56.811
- [knocking on door]
- [Simon] Magnus, you there? It's me.

19:01.700 --> 19:03.740
Okay, time to put your
money where your mouth is

19:03.830 --> 19:05.590
about helping me find
Camille, 'cause Raph...

19:06.040 --> 19:07.700
Man, you are everywhere!

19:07.790 --> 19:09.710
Aldertree did this
to me because of you.

19:09.790 --> 19:12.120
Yeah, well, you look like crap.
Bring it on, Scarface!

19:12.210 --> 19:14.500
Hey, hey, hey, boys. Relax.

19:14.590 --> 19:18.010
Let's talk this out
like civil Downworlders.

19:18.090 --> 19:20.090
Anyone for a martini?

19:20.180 --> 19:21.940
I'm having a double.

19:24.980 --> 19:26.360
You threatened my mother.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.246
And if you'd even lifted half
a finger to find Camille...

19:28.270 --> 19:29.996
Lifted half a finger?
I Portaled to freakin' India

19:30.020 --> 19:31.440
and had to face
off with a cobra!

19:31.520 --> 19:33.270
And all I got was this
stupid box of hers!

19:35.280 --> 19:36.910
This stupid box is sacred.

19:37.700 --> 19:38.910
You know why?

19:39.820 --> 19:41.450
It contains
Camille's grave dirt.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.240
Grave dirt?

19:44.950 --> 19:46.780
I thought maybe diamonds,

19:46.870 --> 19:50.160
or that gold ring she stole
from Cleopatra's tomb.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.730
So we're excited
about a box of dirt.

19:52.630 --> 19:54.220
Anyone wanna clue me in?

19:54.300 --> 19:57.010
If you have a vampire's grave dirt,
you can use it to summon them.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.640
Great. Except,
not that it means anything,

20:00.720 --> 20:02.760
but that thing's harder
to open than the Lost Ark.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.100
Ouch! What the hell?

20:05.180 --> 20:07.810
To open the box,
you need Camille's blood.

20:07.890 --> 20:09.850
And since she's your sire...

20:25.500 --> 20:28.540
Okay. Now what?

20:28.620 --> 20:30.160
[alarm blaring]

20:33.380 --> 20:35.640
- [Clary] Oh, my God, Welkie!
- What happened?

20:37.010 --> 20:38.470
Classic possession hangover.

20:38.550 --> 20:40.600
Hole punched right
through his chest.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.890
Just like our mundane
in the morgue.

20:48.230 --> 20:49.940
The demon's in the Institute.

20:51.190 --> 20:53.900
[Lydia] Activate emergency surveillance.
Victor's unreachable.

20:53.980 --> 20:57.060
I've ordered the Institute be put on
quarantine until we kill this thing.

20:57.150 --> 20:59.820
But I don't get it.
How did the demon get past the wards?

20:59.900 --> 21:02.360
Same way it got in without
setting off this. [Sighs]

21:02.450 --> 21:04.660
It must have some
advanced cloaking ability.

21:04.740 --> 21:06.990
It hid in that dead body
and let us do the rest.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.346
I didn't know demons
could do that.

21:08.370 --> 21:10.540
Until now, they couldn't.
This new form of possession,

21:10.620 --> 21:13.790
cloaking ability,
targeting the Institute, it's...

21:13.880 --> 21:15.720
Valentine. His experiments.

21:17.250 --> 21:20.250
My mom told me how he was
determined to create a super-being

21:20.340 --> 21:23.300
that could defeat the Clave.
It's what he tried to do with Jace.

21:23.390 --> 21:26.230
Both victims had damage
to the prefrontal cortex.

21:26.310 --> 21:29.610
The demon must be feeding on
negative emotions. Anger, hate, rage.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.140
Causing the host to
violently act on those urges.

21:32.230 --> 21:35.030
So we continue to scan for
venom and heat signatures.

21:35.110 --> 21:37.280
Try to narrow down the host
before it strikes again.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.690
Alec,
you check the living quarters.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.080
You two take the
utility tunnels.

21:43.530 --> 21:44.860
I'll stay with you.

21:45.830 --> 21:47.710
Day just keeps getting better.

21:50.620 --> 21:52.660
Demon ichor.

21:52.750 --> 21:56.090
[sighs] It must've come through
here after the kill upstairs.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.370
So Idris, huh?

21:59.460 --> 22:02.340
I thought you were a New York City
girl, tried-and-true.

22:03.260 --> 22:07.230
Wow, does the Institute
have, like, a Twitter feed?

22:07.300 --> 22:09.446
You live in this place long
enough, you know everything.

22:09.470 --> 22:12.260
[Clary sighs] Actually,
I'm still trying to figure it all out.

22:13.690 --> 22:16.530
Is there a rune for letting
you be in two places at once?

22:16.610 --> 22:17.820
I wish.

22:19.780 --> 22:22.160
My mom really wants
me to go with her.

22:22.240 --> 22:25.580
And we went through so much to get
her back, but I just... I don't know.

22:25.660 --> 22:28.210
At least you have a mom
who wants to be with you.

22:29.160 --> 22:32.500
Who thinks you're
smart and wonderful...

22:32.580 --> 22:35.220
Yeah, who erased my memories and
lied to me about having a brother.

22:35.250 --> 22:38.760
I'm not saying she hasn't done
some pretty screwed up things.

22:38.840 --> 22:39.930
But all moms do.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.580
So maybe you should be glad

22:41.670 --> 22:44.550
you have one who wants to
try and make things right.

22:46.390 --> 22:47.390
Wait.

22:49.760 --> 22:52.180
- You think I should go?
- Of course not.

22:52.270 --> 22:56.110
No one in Idris is gonna teach you
how to fight in five-inch heels.

22:56.190 --> 22:57.190
[chuckles softly]

22:58.310 --> 23:00.100
Come on. [Inhales sharply]

23:00.190 --> 23:01.560
We've got a demon to hunt.

23:02.440 --> 23:06.360
If you're trying to make up for
your incompetence, don't bother.

23:06.450 --> 23:08.120
I'm not in a making-up mood.

23:09.370 --> 23:10.370
[in demonic voice] Wow.

23:11.330 --> 23:13.750
No wonder Alec ditched
you for a warlock.

23:18.750 --> 23:21.120
[grunts and groans]

23:21.210 --> 23:22.630
[growls]

23:24.260 --> 23:26.220
You want a piece of this?
Come get it!

23:26.300 --> 23:27.840
- [roars]
- [groaning]

23:27.930 --> 23:29.020
[screams]

23:29.090 --> 23:30.130
[growling]

23:37.600 --> 23:38.850
[bone cracks]

23:47.400 --> 23:49.230
- [screams]
- Lydia!

23:51.580 --> 23:53.170
[growling]

23:53.240 --> 23:54.820
[groaning]

24:00.590 --> 24:02.420
- [groaning]
- [Alec] You're okay.

24:21.060 --> 24:25.480
[Jeremiah] You stand before the sword,
accused of treason against the Clave,

24:25.570 --> 24:29.160
as well as the murder
of two Downworlders.

24:29.240 --> 24:34.120
Be thee innocent or guilty,
may the truth free thy soul.

24:35.910 --> 24:38.580
Have you anything to
say before we start?

24:38.660 --> 24:41.410
Facilis descensus Averno.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.160
"The descent into Hell is easy."

24:45.130 --> 24:47.970
I'm glad you believe in
our sacred Clave motto.

24:48.050 --> 24:51.430
Alec and I use it to remind
each other we can't be broken.

24:58.140 --> 24:59.180
Cold feet?

25:01.730 --> 25:04.070
Listen,
I get this can't be easy,

25:04.150 --> 25:07.820
considering you and Camille used
to, you know...

25:07.900 --> 25:11.230
But... if you're feeling guilty
about handing her over to the Clave,

25:11.320 --> 25:16.110
I can show you phone shots of the
den she created, 'cause it's...

25:16.200 --> 25:17.530
it's messed up.

25:19.250 --> 25:21.420
Plus, she... she killed me, too.
So there's that.

25:21.500 --> 25:24.800
I admit she's gotten more
reckless over the last 200 years.

25:24.880 --> 25:27.380
And I can't defend
anything she's done...

25:28.420 --> 25:30.290
but she isn't pure evil.

25:31.470 --> 25:34.850
Not to doubt your word,
but I need proof of concept on that one.

25:38.810 --> 25:41.480
Not too many people know
this, but...

25:41.560 --> 25:45.310
when I was living in
London, in the early 1870s,

25:45.400 --> 25:47.240
I was in a bad place.

25:48.530 --> 25:50.370
No matter how hard I tried...

25:51.860 --> 25:53.230
I couldn't see my way out.

25:56.330 --> 25:59.170
Then on one particular
stormy night...

26:01.160 --> 26:05.000
I got as far as the ledge
of Blackfriars Bridge.

26:07.710 --> 26:09.120
And if...

26:09.210 --> 26:10.840
if it wasn't for Camille...

26:12.760 --> 26:14.510
I wouldn't be here right now.

26:16.890 --> 26:19.440
She was the only one who
cared enough to stop me.

26:21.430 --> 26:22.850
She saved me.

26:25.690 --> 26:26.780
Wow.

26:28.230 --> 26:31.310
I always thought you were like
the Energizer Bunny of warlocks.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.830
Most of the time I am.

26:35.320 --> 26:40.070
But in my moments of weakness,
I have my rock just as you have yours.

26:41.910 --> 26:42.910
Clary.

26:43.750 --> 26:46.380
So now you see why
it's not so simple.

26:56.970 --> 26:58.270
[door opening]

26:59.720 --> 27:01.930
You caught me...
being a helicopter mom,

27:02.020 --> 27:03.826
making sure there are no
monsters under your bed.

27:03.850 --> 27:04.850
[chuckles softly]

27:05.770 --> 27:08.770
Well, given what that demon just
did to Lydia, I don't blame you.

27:10.690 --> 27:13.060
- I just saw her in the infirmary.
- How is she?

27:13.150 --> 27:16.650
She's hurt pretty badly,
but she's gonna pull through.

27:16.740 --> 27:19.250
- It's nice to hear something positive.
- Yeah.

27:20.660 --> 27:21.870
Mom.

27:23.450 --> 27:24.740
About Idris...

27:28.540 --> 27:30.920
There is a part of me that
wants to come with you...

27:31.590 --> 27:32.630
but...

27:33.420 --> 27:35.340
I have to learn to
stand on my own.

27:37.090 --> 27:42.470
And there are people
here that I can't leave.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.520
[Aldertree] Did you kill
the werewolf Gretel Monroe?

27:50.610 --> 27:51.650
[Jace] No.

27:52.650 --> 27:55.240
But you captured her for your
father, Valentine Morgenstern,

27:55.320 --> 27:57.870
after being encouraged by
your spellbound sister.

27:58.820 --> 28:01.320
I accept full responsibility
for my actions.

28:02.700 --> 28:04.740
You have a great love for your
sister, don't you?

28:05.450 --> 28:08.160
- Leave Clary out of this.
- Yes or no?

28:11.920 --> 28:13.380
[straining] Yes.

28:13.460 --> 28:16.000
In fact, to my understanding,

28:16.090 --> 28:18.460
you two were involved in
a romantic relationship

28:18.550 --> 28:20.510
prior to the discovery
that you were siblings.

28:20.590 --> 28:22.420
Is that true?

28:23.810 --> 28:25.860
Yes. [Breathes heavily]

28:26.980 --> 28:28.270
What about now?

28:29.850 --> 28:31.850
Do you love her the way a
brother loves his sister?

28:34.980 --> 28:36.900
I've tried to fight it, but...

28:36.990 --> 28:38.620
[Aldertree] A simple yes or no.

28:38.700 --> 28:41.700
Do you love Clary the way
a brother loves his sister?

28:42.990 --> 28:44.450
[straining] No.

28:44.530 --> 28:47.030
It's more than that. [Exhales]

28:47.120 --> 28:48.280
I see.

28:49.410 --> 28:50.660
Do you love your father?

28:52.920 --> 28:56.090
I love the dream of the
father I wished he'd be.

28:56.170 --> 28:58.750
The kind of father who wouldn't
kill a young boy's falcon?

28:59.720 --> 29:00.720
Yes.

29:01.550 --> 29:03.840
I know more than you think
about you and dear dad.

29:04.970 --> 29:06.390
To love is to destroy.

29:07.430 --> 29:10.060
Quite a harsh lesson
for a six-year-old boy.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.270
Do you agree with
that sentiment?

29:14.610 --> 29:16.990
Yes. [Sighs]

29:17.070 --> 29:20.240
Do you feel your father's goal
to kill all Downworlders is just?

29:22.450 --> 29:25.370
- Yes and no.
- Which one is it?

29:25.450 --> 29:26.490
Both.

29:26.580 --> 29:29.000
My father's world
view may be misguided,

29:29.080 --> 29:31.380
but I've seen the vampire
dens that are thriving

29:31.460 --> 29:32.976
because of the Clave's
lack of action.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.080
Your lack of action.

29:37.170 --> 29:38.210
Final question.

29:40.340 --> 29:43.710
Can you pledge your unconditional
loyalty to the Clave?

29:43.800 --> 29:47.760
- Facilis descensus Averno.
- I asked you a question.

29:47.850 --> 29:50.560
Can you pledge your unconditional
loyalty to the Clave?

29:51.890 --> 29:53.180
[stammers] I...

29:54.480 --> 29:55.740
Answer!

29:55.810 --> 29:57.140
No!

29:58.610 --> 30:00.030
No, I can't.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.570
[sighs]

30:03.450 --> 30:04.700
Based on your testimony...

30:05.780 --> 30:09.360
I will recommend to the Clave a
punishment of life imprisonment.

30:09.450 --> 30:10.780
[sighs]

30:10.870 --> 30:12.700
May the Angel have mercy on you.

30:16.500 --> 30:17.710
[screaming]

30:22.340 --> 30:24.420
Thank you, Brother Jeremiah.

30:25.050 --> 30:27.260
There will be no martyrs here.

30:34.270 --> 30:35.820
[Simon] Hey, no pressure,

30:35.900 --> 30:39.450
just I promised my mom I'd be home
for dinner at 8:00, so if you could...

30:40.400 --> 30:42.310
I can wait. It's... it's fine.

30:44.820 --> 30:47.320
So, ready to do this?

30:48.490 --> 30:49.530
Almost.

30:52.370 --> 30:54.660
I need you two to
go to this address.

30:54.750 --> 30:58.470
My friend Catarina has some ingredients
I need for extra fortification.

31:00.250 --> 31:02.290
I thought the trap for
Camille was finished.

31:02.380 --> 31:04.486
Yeah, I figured you'd have
something to hold to Hannibal Lecter

31:04.510 --> 31:05.510
and a few of his friends.

31:05.590 --> 31:07.710
Don't underestimate
Camille's strength.

31:09.260 --> 31:11.050
Off to Catarina.

31:27.950 --> 31:29.750
My dearest Camille.

31:37.870 --> 31:38.870
What the hell?

31:39.670 --> 31:40.880
It's only me.

31:43.590 --> 31:44.720
Magnus.

31:45.340 --> 31:46.840
I'm so sorry.

31:50.930 --> 31:54.150
Magnus, let me out of here!

31:54.220 --> 31:55.970
Simon, where are you?

31:56.060 --> 31:59.560
I've tried you back four times.
As soon as you get this, please call me.

32:01.190 --> 32:02.390
Alec.

32:04.110 --> 32:05.120
Alec?

32:06.860 --> 32:08.860
What did I do?

32:30.390 --> 32:31.390
[gasps]

32:36.890 --> 32:38.600
[shuddering]

33:02.130 --> 33:03.550
[Alec] Oh, my God.

33:09.670 --> 33:10.920
Clary, I...

33:12.640 --> 33:14.350
I have a demon to kill.

33:17.810 --> 33:19.610
Don't tell me you're
doing the Clave's bidding

33:19.680 --> 33:23.600
because of your silly infatuation
with that boy toy Shadowhunter.

33:23.690 --> 33:27.660
Leave Alec out of this.
This is between you and me.

33:27.730 --> 33:30.690
The same you and me who crashed
Queen Victoria's coronation

33:30.780 --> 33:33.250
glamoured as the Duke
and Duchess of Cambridge?

33:33.320 --> 33:36.160
Believe me,
this wasn't an easy decision.

33:37.120 --> 33:38.750
But you crossed the line.

33:39.580 --> 33:42.380
I won't let Raphael
suffer for your bad deeds.

33:42.460 --> 33:45.470
So this is about one
little insubordinate vamp?

33:47.420 --> 33:49.670
You've sired
hundreds of vampires.

33:50.630 --> 33:51.750
Your children.

33:52.590 --> 33:54.510
But as a warlock,
I can have none.

33:55.220 --> 33:59.970
The Downworlders I take under my
wing, they are my children. My family.

34:01.560 --> 34:03.350
I'm sorry, Camille.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.860
I'll do whatever it
takes to protect him.

34:10.530 --> 34:12.530
The fear of loneliness...

34:12.610 --> 34:16.150
- has always been your Achilles' heel.
- Don't.

34:16.659 --> 34:21.840
You don't do well losing
those you love... do you?

34:23.580 --> 34:27.120
I'm the only one you can count
on to be here for you forever.

34:27.210 --> 34:28.580
You know that.

34:30.170 --> 34:32.840
That's why you love me...

34:34.179 --> 34:35.850
and you always will.

34:39.719 --> 34:42.679
Choose... me.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.150
Enjoy Idris.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.530
I hear the weather's a delight.

34:59.530 --> 35:00.570
[energy pulsating]

35:00.660 --> 35:01.910
How could you?

35:02.700 --> 35:04.030
I thought you loved me.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.920
Don't do this!

35:13.510 --> 35:17.020
Hey, Clary, my phone ran outta juice
and your last message got cut off.

35:17.090 --> 35:18.170
Sorry. I've been tied up.

35:18.260 --> 35:20.196
Please tell me you haven't
already left for Idris.

35:20.220 --> 35:21.536
I'm on my way to the
Institute right now.

35:21.560 --> 35:23.360
- I'll see you soon... I hope.
- [phone beeps]

35:32.400 --> 35:34.560
- [screaming in distance]
- [blades swishing]

35:37.110 --> 35:39.240
- [screaming continues]
- [blades swishing]

35:41.580 --> 35:42.960
Hodge, do you hear that?

35:43.450 --> 35:44.530
[gasps]

35:44.620 --> 35:46.740
I was hoping it was
another nightmare.

35:46.830 --> 35:48.410
[screaming continues]

35:50.130 --> 35:53.760
[weakly] Please. Help us.

35:53.840 --> 35:56.510
- [Jeremiah grunts]
- What's happening? Grab his hand!

35:56.590 --> 36:00.470
The lock release on our cells can
only be activated if he's alive.

36:05.480 --> 36:06.520
He's gone.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.850
- [blade swishes]
- [man screaming]

36:11.020 --> 36:14.060
An unfortunate loss,
but he gave me no choice.

36:15.320 --> 36:16.990
He wouldn't let it
out of his hands.

36:18.660 --> 36:19.660
[sighs]

36:22.830 --> 36:24.080
[Valentine] Hello, Jonathan.

36:24.160 --> 36:27.580
You see what these people do to you
when I'm not around to protect you?

36:27.660 --> 36:30.750
No, I'm here 'cause you
made a son with demon blood.

36:31.790 --> 36:34.920
Still so little appreciation
after all I've done for you.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.090
You think it was easy,
breaking in here to rescue you?

36:38.170 --> 36:40.340
It took effort.

36:40.430 --> 36:44.270
I set up a demon attack on
the Institute as a diversion.

36:45.100 --> 36:46.520
You did what?

36:48.100 --> 36:51.220
No, you're not here for me.
You're here for the Soul-Sword.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.730
Son, you have two options.

36:53.820 --> 36:56.370
Life in prison at the
hands of the Clave,

36:56.440 --> 37:00.270
or you can come and
fight with me...

37:00.360 --> 37:01.900
and have purpose.

37:05.160 --> 37:08.590
I guess jumping off the
boat wasn't clear enough.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.700
Then we'll do it the hard way.

37:11.790 --> 37:13.540
Take him.

37:13.630 --> 37:15.090
[grunting]

37:16.590 --> 37:17.790
Thank you for your assistance.

37:19.550 --> 37:20.810
[Aldertree groans]

37:20.880 --> 37:22.260
[Valentine panting]

37:26.100 --> 37:27.270
Hodge!

37:38.610 --> 37:39.690
[groans]

37:57.590 --> 37:58.760
Thank you, Dorothea.

37:59.420 --> 38:02.050
At least someone here understands
the meaning of the word loyalty.

38:08.140 --> 38:09.270
Go ahead.

38:09.350 --> 38:11.730
Kill me like you
killed my falcon.

38:11.810 --> 38:13.970
Prove what kind of
father you really are.

38:19.690 --> 38:22.610
What are you waiting for? Do it.

38:27.830 --> 38:29.870
Take my son.

38:29.950 --> 38:31.200
Kill the other one.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.470
[grunting]

38:40.340 --> 38:42.260
Jace! Get the sword!

38:58.650 --> 38:59.740
Please, let me do this.

38:59.820 --> 39:01.950
You don't have to put
yourself in danger. Not now.

39:03.150 --> 39:04.630
Izzy, we need your help!
Jocelyn's...

39:04.700 --> 39:06.260
[in demonic voice]
Dead because of you.

39:08.370 --> 39:10.290
[growls]

39:10.370 --> 39:11.676
- It's inside her.
- It's still Izzy.

39:11.700 --> 39:12.820
Be careful where you aim.

39:21.710 --> 39:22.790
[growls]

39:28.010 --> 39:31.050
- Izzy, please stop! Izzy...
- [growling continues]

39:35.270 --> 39:36.270
[grunts]

39:39.690 --> 39:42.360
Always the favorite child.

39:43.570 --> 39:45.120
I'm done living in your shadow.

39:45.190 --> 39:48.190
Izzy, if you're in there,
please listen to me.

39:49.660 --> 39:51.460
Nice try.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.790
[grunting]

40:12.850 --> 40:15.310
Go back to Hell
where you belong.

40:15.390 --> 40:16.640
[grunts]

40:20.770 --> 40:23.020
[panting] Izzy...

40:23.110 --> 40:24.450
Izzy, are you all right?

40:24.530 --> 40:25.950
[Alec] Izzy!

40:27.150 --> 40:28.900
Izzy... Please.

40:29.780 --> 40:31.990
Please be okay, Izzy.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.750
[gasps] What happened?

41:18.250 --> 41:20.090
[panting] Hey.
