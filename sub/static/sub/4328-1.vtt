00:26.944 --> 00:29.570
Ta-da!

00:29.571 --> 00:31.113
Ta-da!

00:31.114 --> 00:32.323
Ta-da!

00:32.323 --> 00:33.908
Ta-da! Ta...
Ta-da!

00:36.161 --> 00:37.205
Ta-da!

00:37.663 --> 00:38.706
Ta-da!

02:01.705 --> 02:02.749
Huh?

03:14.986 --> 03:18.581
Three weeks, and we're
still no closer to cracking this.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.577
Right, bring him in!

03:21.743 --> 03:22.917
Yes, sir.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.278
This is the best party ever!

04:03.994 --> 04:05.037
Yeah!

04:08.331 --> 04:10.004
Ha!

04:17.466 --> 04:20.562
Oh, no!
A dragon is approaching!

04:25.849 --> 04:30.144
Fear not, for here come the
gallant knights to save us.

04:30.145 --> 04:31.189
Yay!

04:47.954 --> 04:50.719
No, no, no. What do you
mean she's not coming?

04:50.874 --> 04:53.674
I have a backyard full
of these little girls

04:53.835 --> 04:57.713
who are counting on a visit
from a fairy princess.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.763
Hurts! Stop it!

05:04.471 --> 05:08.730
Listen! I don't want a refund, I
want the fairy princess, please!

05:08.892 --> 05:11.193
Please, I'm begging you.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.689
You know what? I hope that
you can sleep at night,

05:13.855 --> 05:16.192
you crusher of
little girls' dreams!

05:16.399 --> 05:17.524
Ooh, ooh!

05:17.526 --> 05:18.949
When's the fairy
princess coming?

05:19.903 --> 05:21.575
Any minute now!

05:21.738 --> 05:23.624
Yay!

05:24.199 --> 05:25.407
Stall them!

05:29.663 --> 05:30.706
Ooh!

05:40.423 --> 05:43.141
Whoa! Whoa, okay!
Okay, all right.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.969
That's enough of
the magic show.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.013
Aw!

05:48.139 --> 05:50.275
Wait, did you hear that?

05:50.433 --> 05:54.111
It sounded like the twinkling
sounds of magical fairy dust.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.563
It's the fairy
princess! She's coming!

05:56.565 --> 05:58.783
Look!

06:07.701 --> 06:09.622
- Huh? Oh!
- Eh?

06:12.706 --> 06:15.082
Ow!

06:16.626 --> 06:18.263
Ow.

06:25.927 --> 06:29.984
It is I, Gruzinkerbell,

06:30.140 --> 06:34.565
the most magical
fairy princess of all!

06:34.728 --> 06:38.738
And I am here to
wish Princess Agnes

06:38.898 --> 06:41.069
a very happy birthday!

06:41.359 --> 06:43.115
How come you're so fat?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.457
Because

06:45.614 --> 06:48.164
my house is made of candy,

06:48.325 --> 06:52.168
and sometimes I eat
instead of facing my problems!

06:52.329 --> 06:53.620
How come you have...

06:54.789 --> 06:56.676
Okay, time for cake.

06:56.916 --> 06:57.960
Yay!

07:01.296 --> 07:04.677
Thank you, Gruzinkerbell! You're
the best fairy princess ever!

07:04.841 --> 07:08.139
You are welcome, little girl!

07:09.763 --> 07:14.271
I know it's really you, Gru. I'm
just pretending for the other kids.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.903
Hey there, Gru. Mr. Life of the Party!

07:22.067 --> 07:23.573
Hello, Jillian.

07:23.735 --> 07:26.784
So, I'm gonna go
out on a limb here,

07:26.946 --> 07:31.621
but my friend Natalie is
recently single, and... Oop.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.836
No, no, no, get off the limb right now.
No limb.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.253
Come on, she's a riot!

07:38.416 --> 07:41.382
She sings karaoke,
she has a lot of free time,

07:41.544 --> 07:44.178
looks aren't that
important to her...

07:44.339 --> 07:48.301
No, Jills, that is not happening.
Seriously, I'm fine.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.928
Okay, fine, forget Natalie.
How about my cousin Linda?

07:50.929 --> 07:52.096
No!

07:52.097 --> 07:54.890
Oh! Oh! I know someone whose
husband just died...

07:57.477 --> 08:00.111
I'm sorry,
I did not see you there.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.482
Or there.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.206
Kyle? Kyle?

08:15.537 --> 08:18.835
Kyle, no! Do not do your
business on the petunias!

08:20.542 --> 08:23.045
There you go.
Those are Fred's, go crazy.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.434
Good boy!

08:28.591 --> 08:29.758
Mr. Gru?

08:29.759 --> 08:31.178
I didn't...
What? Yes?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.977
Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde
of the AVL.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.393
Oh, whoops!

08:39.394 --> 08:41.731
Sorry, you're gonna
have to come with me.

08:41.895 --> 08:44.364
Oh, sorry, I...
Freeze ray!

08:48.194 --> 08:50.081
You know,
you really should announce

08:50.238 --> 08:52.124
your weapons after
you fire them, Mr. Gru.

08:52.407 --> 08:53.795
For example...

08:56.536 --> 08:58.755
Lipstick taser!

08:59.539 --> 09:01.509
Oh, it works so good.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.145
Man!

09:13.094 --> 09:15.395
Large person.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.823
Oh, sorry.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.869
Get in there...
Huh?

09:30.069 --> 09:32.750
...you big man!

09:38.161 --> 09:39.205
Boss!

09:53.676 --> 09:54.720
Uh? Huh!

09:59.516 --> 10:00.559
Whoa!

10:02.477 --> 10:03.602
Huh?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.240
Ah! Whoo!

10:05.897 --> 10:06.941
Ooh!

10:26.084 --> 10:27.128
Oh!

10:28.545 --> 10:30.796
Huh? Ah. Quack, quack!

11:42.368 --> 11:44.161
Wow!

12:29.290 --> 12:31.342
What? Where?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.296
Whoa, foot is asleep.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.633
Ah, pins and needles!

12:37.632 --> 12:39.549
Good afternoon,
Mr. Gru.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.717
Eh.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.601
I apologize for our methods
in getting you here.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.809
I don't. I'd do it
again in a heartbeat.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.109
I am not gonna lie,
I enjoyed that.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.894
Every second of it. Gave me
a bit of a buzz, actually.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.651
That's enough, Agent Wilde.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.106
Sorry, sir.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.660
Okay, this is bogus!

12:56.985 --> 12:59.986
I don't know who you people
think you are, but...

12:59.988 --> 13:02.408
We are
the Anti-Villain League.

13:02.573 --> 13:08.042
An ultra-secret organization dedicated
to fighting crime on a global scale.

13:08.204 --> 13:13.210
Rob a bank, we're not interested.
Kill someone, not our deal.

13:13.584 --> 13:18.140
But you want to melt the polar ice
caps, or vaporize Mount Fuji,

13:18.297 --> 13:21.845
or even steal the Moon...

13:22.218 --> 13:24.354
Then we notice.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.360
First of all, you got
no proof that I did that.

13:27.515 --> 13:31.228
Second, after I did
do that, I put it back!

13:31.436 --> 13:33.192
We're well aware of that,
Mr. Gru.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.157
That's why we brought you here.

13:35.314 --> 13:39.277
I am the League's director,
Silas Ramsbottom.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.653
Bottom.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.452
Hilarious.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.291
Agent Wilde?

13:48.453 --> 13:49.794
Oh, me now? Ah.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.793
Um, recently,
an entire top-secret lab

13:51.956 --> 13:53.759
disappeared from
the Arctic Circle.

13:53.916 --> 13:57.544
Yeah, the entire lab, just...

13:57.545 --> 13:59.681
Gone. Where did it go?

13:59.839 --> 14:01.180
I don't care.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.593
Hmm. The lab was
devoted to experiments

14:04.594 --> 14:07.144
involving PX-41,
a transmutation serum.

14:07.305 --> 14:11.232
What is PX-41, you ask?
Mmm, it's pretty bad. Look.

14:20.818 --> 14:21.862
Ah!

14:30.995 --> 14:33.914
Huh, you usually don't
see that in bunnies.

14:33.915 --> 14:37.959
As you can see, in the wrong
hands, the PX-41 serum

14:37.960 --> 14:41.093
could be the most devastating
weapon on Earth.

14:42.548 --> 14:47.427
Fortunately, it has a very
distinct chemical footprint.

14:47.428 --> 14:50.477
And using the latest
chem-tracking technology,

14:50.681 --> 14:53.850
we found traces of it
in the Paradise Mall.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.310
A mall?

14:55.311 --> 14:57.815
Precisely. And we
believe that one of these

14:57.980 --> 15:00.565
shop owners is
a master criminal.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.858
And that's where you come in.

15:01.859 --> 15:06.321
As an ex-villain, you know how a
villain thinks, how a villain acts.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.244
The plan is to set
you up undercover

15:08.407 --> 15:10.408
at a shop in the mall,
where hopefully...

15:10.409 --> 15:13.453
Okay, I see
where this is going,

15:13.454 --> 15:16.873
with all the <i>Mission: Impossible</i>
stuff, but no. No!

15:16.874 --> 15:20.669
I'm a father now.
And a legitimate businessman.

15:20.670 --> 15:24.383
I am developing a line
of delicious jams and jellies.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.597
"Jams and jellies"?

15:27.927 --> 15:30.929
Oh, attitude!
That's right!

15:30.930 --> 15:32.852
So, thanks, but no thanks.

15:33.850 --> 15:38.854
And here's a tip. Instead of
taeing people and kidnapping them,

15:38.855 --> 15:41.358
maybe you should
just give them a call!

15:41.691 --> 15:43.859
Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.117
Ramsbottom.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.195
Oh, yeah,
like that's any better.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.406
Hello.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.256
Look, I probably shouldn't
be saying this,

16:03.421 --> 16:06.304
but your work as a villain
was kind of amazing.

16:06.465 --> 16:10.606
So, if you ever wanna get back
to doing something awesome,

16:11.429 --> 16:13.398
give us a call.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.877
Hey, I told you
guys to get to bed.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.244
Oh, sorry.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.871
So, when you going
on your date?

16:37.872 --> 16:39.122
What?

16:39.123 --> 16:41.211
Remember, Miss Jillian said she
was arranging a date for you.

16:41.334 --> 16:45.344
Yeah, well, she is a nut job,
and I'm not going on any date.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.598
Why not? Are you scared?

16:54.597 --> 16:57.445
Hey, did you guys see
the Moon landing on TV?

16:57.600 --> 17:00.150
Yeah, I can't believe it.
It's so cool!

17:00.311 --> 17:01.604
Excuse me? Lisa?

17:01.771 --> 17:03.146
I was talking to
Billy the other day.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.314
No way!

17:04.315 --> 17:05.732
He is so cute.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.902
Ah. Hey, Lisa,
I was wondering if you...

17:08.903 --> 17:13.126
Ew! Gru touched Lisa!
Gru touched Lisa!

17:13.366 --> 17:14.492
Ew!

17:14.951 --> 17:16.920
Lisa's got Gruties!

17:24.377 --> 17:28.253
Scared? Of what? Women?
No! That's bonkers!

17:28.256 --> 17:32.479
I just have no interest in going on
a date, that's all. Case closed.

17:32.635 --> 17:35.732
I'm not scared.
Of women. Or dates.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.681
Let's go to bed.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.440
Good night, Edith.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.229
Good night, Margo.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.231
Hold the horses.
Who are you texting?

17:46.232 --> 17:47.822
No one. Just my friend Avery.

17:47.942 --> 17:52.821
Avery. Avery? Is that
a girl's name or a boy's name?

17:52.822 --> 17:54.280
Does it matter?

17:54.282 --> 17:57.580
No, no, it doesn't
matter unless it's a boy!

17:57.827 --> 17:59.962
I know what makes you a boy.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.371
Uh, ooh,

18:01.372 --> 18:03.175
you do?

18:03.749 --> 18:05.422
Your bald head.

18:06.294 --> 18:08.049
Oh, yes.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.134
It's really smooth.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.970
Sometimes I stare at it, and imagine
a little chick popping out.

18:14.927 --> 18:15.971
Peep peep peep.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.899
Good night, Agnes.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.146
Never get older.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.013
Hey, oh!

18:58.888 --> 19:00.221
Uh...

19:00.222 --> 19:02.557
Okay, okay.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.226
Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

19:35.341 --> 19:39.813
Donnie, hang in there, baby!
It's almost Friday.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.722
So, how's today's batch,
Dr. Nefario?

19:42.723 --> 19:44.516
I developed a new formula

19:44.517 --> 19:46.818
which allowed me
to get every known

19:46.977 --> 19:49.279
kind of berry into
one flavor of jelly.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.448
That tastes good!

19:54.610 --> 19:57.278
I love the flavor of that!

19:57.279 --> 19:58.490
It's horrible, isn't it?

19:58.656 --> 19:59.913
No, no!

20:00.366 --> 20:02.786
Oh, we're making
great progress!

20:02.952 --> 20:04.375
Here, try some of this.

20:04.495 --> 20:05.622
Mmm.

20:08.666 --> 20:09.710
Ah.

20:15.589 --> 20:16.717
Whoa.

20:16.882 --> 20:21.853
Okay, just because everybody hates
it, doesn't mean it's not good!

20:22.263 --> 20:23.734
Listen, Gru.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.479
There's something
I've been meaning

20:25.641 --> 20:27.278
to talk to you
about for some time now.

20:27.435 --> 20:29.155
What? What's wrong?

20:29.478 --> 20:30.522
Um...

20:32.356 --> 20:34.408
I miss being evil.

20:34.567 --> 20:38.707
Sinister plots, large-scale
crimes, it's what I live for.

20:38.863 --> 20:43.667
I mean, don't you think there's
more to our future than jelly?

20:43.826 --> 20:47.005
Well, I'm also
considering a line of jams.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.380
Um, the thing is, Gru,

20:51.750 --> 20:53.756
I've had an offer of
employment elsewhere.

20:54.545 --> 20:56.254
Dr. Nefario!

20:56.255 --> 20:58.307
Come on, you're kidding, right?

20:58.466 --> 21:00.518
It's a great
opportunity for me.

21:00.676 --> 21:03.393
Bigger lab, more evil,

21:03.679 --> 21:05.269
full dental.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.148
Very well.

21:15.149 --> 21:18.780
Let us give you
the proper send-off.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.499
Minions!

21:24.492 --> 21:29.332
The highest honor
awarded to Dr. Nefario

21:29.497 --> 21:32.261
for your years of service,

21:32.416 --> 21:35.798
the 21-fart gun salute!

21:45.221 --> 21:47.142
Uh, I counted 22.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.438
Farewell, my friends.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.046
This may take a while.

22:16.544 --> 22:18.631
Go about your business.

22:20.798 --> 22:23.479
I miss you already!

23:05.092 --> 23:06.184
Huh?

23:10.097 --> 23:11.141
Huh.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.693
Are you sure we
should be doing this?

23:20.858 --> 23:22.910
Yes, it's for his own good.

23:23.193 --> 23:25.653
Okay,
we need to choose a picture.

23:25.654 --> 23:26.828
No.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.331
Scary.

23:28.490 --> 23:29.582
Weird.

23:30.868 --> 23:32.209
What is that?

23:32.328 --> 23:35.045
Good morning, girls! I have
an announcement to make.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.175
Hey, what
celebrity do you look like?

23:37.333 --> 23:39.254
Uh, Bruce Willis.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.171
Mmm, no.

23:41.545 --> 23:42.968
Humpty Dumpty!

23:43.464 --> 23:44.591
Ooh, Gollum!

23:45.966 --> 23:48.134
Okay, what are you doing?

23:48.135 --> 23:50.136
We're signing you
up for online dating!

23:50.137 --> 23:53.014
Oh, okay. What? No, no, no.

23:53.015 --> 23:54.974
Oh, come on. It's fun.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.934
And it's time for
you to get out there.

23:56.935 --> 24:00.229
No! Stop! No one is ever
getting out there! Ever!

24:00.230 --> 24:03.524
Oh! Okay, now for
the announcement.

24:03.525 --> 24:06.027
I have accepted a new job.

24:06.028 --> 24:07.320
Whoa! Really?

24:07.321 --> 24:10.907
Yes, I have been recruited
by a top-secret agency

24:10.908 --> 24:13.368
to go undercover
and save the world!

24:13.369 --> 24:14.786
You're gonna be a spy?

24:14.787 --> 24:16.746
That's right, baby!

24:16.747 --> 24:18.706
Gru's back in the game.

24:18.707 --> 24:22.502
With gadgets and weapons and cool cars.
The whole deal.

24:22.503 --> 24:23.711
Awesome!

24:23.712 --> 24:25.931
Are you really
gonna save the world?

24:26.340 --> 24:29.555
Yes. Yes, I am.

24:53.242 --> 24:54.285
Ah!

25:00.916 --> 25:02.008
Hmm.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.465
"Bake My Day."

25:05.254 --> 25:06.297
Blech.

25:14.596 --> 25:18.772
All right, here is the cupcake
recipe I got off the Internet.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.697
And don't go nuts
with the sprinkles!

25:47.463 --> 25:48.629
Whoo.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.644
I wasn't expecting that.
Or was I?

25:52.634 --> 25:55.683
Ooh. You got a little...

25:58.182 --> 25:59.938
Here, I'll get it.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.392
Oh.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.060
It's just spreading.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.438
All right, all right.
I got it! Stop it!

26:05.439 --> 26:06.981
Oh.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.026
I'll let you get it.

26:10.194 --> 26:11.986
Yeah, what you just
saw there was a little

26:11.987 --> 26:13.738
something new
I've been working on.

26:13.739 --> 26:17.742
It's a combination of Jujitsu,
Krav Maga, Aztec warfare

26:17.743 --> 26:19.582
and krumping.

26:20.037 --> 26:22.830
Okay, that's weird.
Why are you here?

26:22.831 --> 26:25.465
On assignment from Silas.
I'm your new partner.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.795
Yay!

26:27.002 --> 26:29.629
What? No, no "yay".

26:29.630 --> 26:32.423
Ramsbottom didn't say anything
about a partner.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.425
Well, it seems that because
of your checkered past,

26:34.426 --> 26:36.260
everyone else
refused to work with you.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.646
But not me. I stepped up.

26:38.806 --> 26:42.234
And I'm new, so I kind of have
to do what they tell me anyway.

26:42.768 --> 26:43.812
Walla!

26:46.271 --> 26:47.315
Ya!

26:47.523 --> 26:48.566
Aah!

26:49.233 --> 26:50.525
Do you know this guy?

26:50.526 --> 26:52.531
Yes, he's one of my minions.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.493
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.578
I should have known.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.413
You are free to go.

27:03.831 --> 27:06.844
Uh? Ah!

27:14.132 --> 27:15.176
<i>Kampai!</i>

27:29.857 --> 27:31.023
Oh!

27:31.024 --> 27:32.068
<i>Dave...</i>

27:33.485 --> 27:35.444
Earth to Dave!

27:35.445 --> 27:36.489
Huh?

27:36.697 --> 27:38.322
You can leave now.

27:38.323 --> 27:39.742
Oh, uh...

27:46.874 --> 27:49.210
So, what do we got?
Who's on the list?

27:49.418 --> 27:50.628
Fire them at me.

27:50.794 --> 27:53.179
First suspect,
Hedda Blumentoft,

27:53.338 --> 27:55.758
proprietor of Mum's
the Word Floral Shop.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.597
No, not her.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.385
Okay, moving on...

27:59.386 --> 28:02.186
Chuck Kinney,
owner of Stuff-A-Bear.

28:04.308 --> 28:05.351
Ooh.

28:05.601 --> 28:06.728
I don't think so.

28:07.311 --> 28:08.604
Hello?

28:11.940 --> 28:14.526
<i>Buenos días,</i> my friends!

28:14.693 --> 28:17.279
I am Eduardo Perez,

28:17.446 --> 28:20.708
owner of <i>Salsa y Salsa</i>
restaurant, across the mall.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.796
Now open for breakfast.
And you are?

28:23.952 --> 28:26.716
Gru. And this is Lucy.
And we are closed.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.959
This is just going
to take <i>un momento.</i>

28:29.124 --> 28:31.544
I am throwing a big
<i>Cinco de Mayo</i> party,

28:31.710 --> 28:35.796
and I am going to need
200 of your best cupcakes

28:35.797 --> 28:39.717
decorated with
the Mexican flag.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.510
It looks something like this.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.442
What do you think?

28:44.598 --> 28:46.474
- Ooh.
- Oh.

28:46.475 --> 28:47.683
Look away!

28:47.684 --> 28:48.809
You, whoo.

28:49.978 --> 28:53.858
Anyway, I have to go. It's all settled.
I'll pick them up next week!

28:54.024 --> 28:57.867
Have a good day. Come by
if you get a chance, okay?

29:01.073 --> 29:04.620
And welcome to the mall family.

29:12.209 --> 29:13.632
El Macho.

29:14.127 --> 29:15.252
What?

29:15.253 --> 29:16.504
But it couldn't be.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.058
What? What couldn't be?

29:19.257 --> 29:24.720
That guy looks exactly like
a villain named El Macho.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.608
From about 20 years ago.

29:32.646 --> 29:34.117
<i>He was ruthless!</i>

29:34.272 --> 29:35.744
<i>He was dangerous.</i>

29:35.899 --> 29:39.826
<i>And as the name implies,
very macho.</i>

29:50.038 --> 29:55.044
<i>He had a reputation for pulling off
heists using only his bare hands!</i>

29:57.129 --> 30:02.218
<i>But sadly, like all the greats,
El Macho was gone too soon.</i>

30:02.884 --> 30:05.678
<i>He died in the most
macho way possible.</i>

30:05.679 --> 30:07.513
<i>Riding a shark</i>

30:07.514 --> 30:11.773
<i>with 250 pounds of dynamite
strapped to his chest</i>

30:11.935 --> 30:15.945
<i>into the mouth of
an active volcano!</i>

30:18.483 --> 30:20.037
<i>It was glorious.</i>

30:21.653 --> 30:25.247
Yeah, sounds like
El Macho's pretty dead.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.827
They never found the body.
Oh, no.

30:27.993 --> 30:33.166
All that was ever retrieved was
a pile of singed chest hair.

30:33.331 --> 30:36.879
But that face!
It has got to be El Macho!

30:37.461 --> 30:41.304
Then what do you say you and I
break into his restaurant? Tonight?

30:41.465 --> 30:44.175
Yes, that's good,
because I am telling you,

30:44.176 --> 30:48.435
if anybody in this
place has the PX-41 serum,

30:49.097 --> 30:50.651
it's him.

30:52.976 --> 30:56.979
All right, all right, homework done,
pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.238
What's the big hurry?

30:58.398 --> 31:00.357
I just have
a lot of work to do.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.318
Work, what kind of work?

31:02.319 --> 31:04.111
Very important business.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.030
So, hugs, kisses.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.908
Good night, sleep tight, don't
let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah.

31:08.909 --> 31:10.034
Whoa!

31:10.035 --> 31:11.755
But you said
you'd help me practice

31:11.912 --> 31:13.632
my part for
the Mother's Day show.

31:15.207 --> 31:18.303
Fine, fine.
Let me hear it. Quickly.

31:18.710 --> 31:22.222
<i>She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair.</i>

31:22.380 --> 31:25.264
<i>My mother is beyond compare.</i>

31:25.425 --> 31:28.308
<i>We love you,
mothers, everywhere.</i>

31:28.845 --> 31:31.693
Wow! That was something else.

31:31.848 --> 31:34.814
I really liked the way
you smiled at the end.

31:34.976 --> 31:36.982
Let's try this one more time,

31:37.145 --> 31:42.316
but a teensy bit less
like a zombie, okay?

31:42.317 --> 31:43.442
Okay.

31:43.443 --> 31:46.570
<i>She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair...</i>

31:46.571 --> 31:48.447
Perfect! Time to go.

31:48.448 --> 31:51.075
I don't think I should do this.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.452
Well, what do you mean?
Why not?

31:53.453 --> 31:55.174
I don't even have a mom.

31:56.039 --> 31:58.749
Well, you don't need
one to do the show.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.838
I mean, you did
the Veterans Day Pageant

32:01.002 --> 32:03.138
and you haven't been in combat.

32:04.131 --> 32:05.602
This is different.

32:05.757 --> 32:10.681
Okay, well, then maybe you can
just use your imagination.

32:10.887 --> 32:13.568
You mean I
pretend I have a mom?

32:13.723 --> 32:16.642
Yes, right?
You can do that, can't you?

32:16.643 --> 32:18.853
Yeah! I do that all the time.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.241
Thanks, Gru!

32:23.483 --> 32:26.069
Hey!

32:51.887 --> 32:54.179
All right. Hey, hey,
no, no! No.

32:54.181 --> 32:56.473
Hey. Hey, please.

32:56.474 --> 32:59.727
Kevin, Jerry,
watch the girls for me, okay?

32:59.728 --> 33:03.109
Dave, Stuart, come this way!
With me! Come on!

33:05.734 --> 33:07.151
Come on!

33:07.152 --> 33:08.196
Mmm-mmm!

33:38.225 --> 33:39.268
Oh!

33:41.978 --> 33:43.022
Mmm-hmm.

33:46.775 --> 33:47.818
Huh?

33:53.615 --> 33:55.702
Oca!
Oca!

34:12.592 --> 34:13.636
Looka too!

34:18.889 --> 34:19.934
Huh?

35:00.015 --> 35:03.396
We're stealth ninjas.
We make no sound.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.731
Right. Gotcha.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.444
Ya!

35:10.483 --> 35:13.152
All right, El Macho.
You're going down.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.205
Wait! Wait.
What?

35:16.364 --> 35:18.032
What are you doing?

35:18.033 --> 35:20.666
I'm checking for
laser beam alarm triggers.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.245
It's a restaurant!

35:23.246 --> 35:24.913
You never know what
kind of booby traps

35:24.914 --> 35:26.540
this guy could have set.
Huh? Come on.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.961
There are no booby traps.

35:30.295 --> 35:31.683
Ha! Booby!

35:43.183 --> 35:44.606
Oh. There's a chicken.

35:44.934 --> 35:47.022
Are you lost, little guy?

35:47.187 --> 35:49.073
You must be lost.

35:49.189 --> 35:51.106
Ha! Some guard dog.

35:55.612 --> 35:57.831
Get it off of me!
Get it off of me!

35:58.323 --> 35:59.415
Aah!

36:05.372 --> 36:07.044
I got you!

36:11.961 --> 36:13.219
I got it!

36:21.888 --> 36:22.980
Ha!

36:25.141 --> 36:26.185
Oh!

36:32.482 --> 36:34.950
What is wrong
with that chicken?

36:35.693 --> 36:39.122
Hey, that <i>pollo es loco.</i>

36:40.198 --> 36:41.448
No?

36:41.449 --> 36:43.086
Okay, let's go.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.965
Are you getting anything?

36:52.127 --> 36:53.794
No, not yet.

36:53.795 --> 36:57.556
But, hey, maybe you can find
something with these X-ray goggles.

36:59.509 --> 37:00.553
Bah.

37:05.432 --> 37:07.766
How are they working?
Tell me! Tell me!

37:07.767 --> 37:09.226
Aah! Oof!

37:09.227 --> 37:10.894
What's wrong?
Is something wrong?

37:10.895 --> 37:14.241
That's an image I'll never
get out of my brain. Blech!

37:22.365 --> 37:24.366
I knew it!

37:24.367 --> 37:26.285
The serum is in here!

37:26.286 --> 37:27.661
Ooh, then let's get it.

37:29.539 --> 37:32.124
This is going to be good!

37:32.125 --> 37:33.169
Ah.

37:37.422 --> 37:38.466
Ah-ha!

37:38.798 --> 37:39.890
What?

37:41.926 --> 37:43.314
Salsa?

37:43.511 --> 37:45.065
Aw, man.

37:46.639 --> 37:47.683
Oh.

37:50.768 --> 37:54.612
Somebody's going
to die tonight.

37:59.694 --> 38:00.952
Pollito!

38:01.946 --> 38:04.448
What did they do to you?
Pollito? Can you hear me?

38:05.617 --> 38:09.077
Who would do this to such
a sweet little chicken?

38:09.078 --> 38:11.079
What? Who's there?

38:11.080 --> 38:12.165
Mmm-mmm.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.760
You coming out?
Or am I gonna go in?

38:20.131 --> 38:21.519
Yah!

38:22.759 --> 38:23.803
Huh?

38:24.802 --> 38:26.053
Stop!

38:26.054 --> 38:27.857
My eyes!

38:29.516 --> 38:31.437
Gru, call one of
your munchkins!

38:32.101 --> 38:33.852
We've been spotted!
Come get us!

38:33.853 --> 38:35.562
Huh? Hey!

38:35.563 --> 38:36.773
Ah!

38:46.783 --> 38:48.040
Hmm, subtle.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.299
Over here! Over here!

38:54.457 --> 38:56.011
Over

38:56.167 --> 38:57.259
here.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.308
Hold tight!

39:09.138 --> 39:10.182
Aah!

39:15.895 --> 39:18.481
I have you now!

39:53.641 --> 39:55.563
Yay! Ice cream!

39:57.061 --> 39:58.105
Huh?

40:16.664 --> 40:18.634
Huh?

40:53.242 --> 40:54.796
All right, there he is.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.836
Suspect number eight,
Floyd Eaglesan.

40:57.997 --> 40:59.468
Oh, okay.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.629
See if you can get closer.
Go, go.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.191
All right.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.432
What the...

41:16.766 --> 41:18.736
Oh, no. That's not good.

41:20.561 --> 41:21.686
Whoa!

41:21.688 --> 41:22.731
Hey, uh, what?

41:25.149 --> 41:26.193
Oh!

41:30.446 --> 41:32.036
Hey, Gru!

41:32.240 --> 41:34.658
Oh, girls! What are you
doing here?

41:34.659 --> 41:36.628
Well, we thought
we'd come visit you at work.

41:36.786 --> 41:39.467
So, you're saving the world
in a garbage can?

41:40.998 --> 41:42.124
Funny.

41:42.125 --> 41:43.964
Hey! There you are.

41:44.127 --> 41:45.384
Oh. Who's this?

41:45.545 --> 41:49.602
Lucy, these are my girls,
Margo, Edith and Agnes.

41:49.757 --> 41:52.521
Girls, Lucy. Lucy, girls.

41:52.677 --> 41:54.516
Hello.
Hi.

42:02.979 --> 42:04.450
Are you single?

42:05.523 --> 42:06.731
Oh! Goodness.

42:06.733 --> 42:10.825
Oh, hey! I have an idea. Since Lucy
and I have lots of work to do,

42:10.987 --> 42:13.621
why don't you girls go and
explore the mall? Bye!

42:13.781 --> 42:16.950
Here is some money, go buy
some useless mall junk.

42:16.951 --> 42:18.618
Some headbands and...

42:18.619 --> 42:20.245
Are you gonna marry Lucy?

42:20.246 --> 42:24.126
Are you out of your gourd?
No! She just works with me.

42:24.292 --> 42:25.633
Plus, you love her.

42:25.793 --> 42:28.511
<i>You love her! You love her!
You really, really love her!</i>

42:28.671 --> 42:29.921
<i>And you're gonna get married!</i>

42:29.922 --> 42:31.089
Okay, stop.
This is a song of lies.

42:31.090 --> 42:32.257
<i>And I will be the flower girl!</i>

42:32.258 --> 42:34.384
I don't even like her.
Now, go have fun!

42:36.262 --> 42:38.472
Almost forgot. Hugs!

42:38.473 --> 42:40.056
Good luck saving the world.
Bye.

42:40.057 --> 42:41.268
Bye, Gru!

42:45.688 --> 42:49.065
Kids, right? They're funny.

42:49.066 --> 42:51.109
Those girls totally adore you.

42:51.110 --> 42:52.866
I bet you're a fun dad.

42:53.529 --> 42:54.696
Huh.

42:54.697 --> 42:56.619
I am pretty fun.

43:05.708 --> 43:07.096
Is that stealing?

43:07.210 --> 43:10.009
Not if my wish was that I would
get a lot of free coins.

43:37.740 --> 43:39.081
Whoa!

43:41.244 --> 43:42.750
Cool glasses.

43:42.954 --> 43:43.997
Oh.

43:44.705 --> 43:46.177
I'm Antonio.

43:46.415 --> 43:48.302
I'm Margo.

43:48.459 --> 43:52.128
I was just going to get a cookie.
Care to join me?

43:52.129 --> 43:53.885
Uh, sure.

43:54.507 --> 43:56.844
I'm Margo.

44:04.809 --> 44:07.102
Um, I'll catch up
with you guys later.

44:07.103 --> 44:08.360
Bye!

44:10.189 --> 44:12.649
Can I be
the first to say, "Ew!"

44:12.650 --> 44:14.536
We gotta go tell Gru!

44:19.240 --> 44:20.830
All right, I'm going in.

44:20.992 --> 44:24.035
<i>If it picks up any traces of the
serum, the sensor in your belt buckle</i>

44:24.036 --> 44:25.495
will make a sound like this...

44:25.496 --> 44:26.830
Mee-maw! Mee-maw!

44:26.831 --> 44:27.956
<i>Mee-maw! Mee-maw!</i>
Okay!

44:27.957 --> 44:29.796
I get it. I get it.

44:36.591 --> 44:40.019
Welcome to Eagle Hair Club.

44:40.219 --> 44:42.687
It's about time you showed up,

44:42.847 --> 44:44.222
Mr. Gru.

44:45.433 --> 44:47.434
You know my name?

44:48.644 --> 44:51.990
When someone moves into the mall
who is folically-challenged,

44:52.189 --> 44:55.653
I make it my business
to know all about them.

44:55.818 --> 44:58.452
You are bald, and that is bad.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.287
There you go, my sweet.

45:01.741 --> 45:03.366
<i>I'm getting nothing so far.</i>

45:03.367 --> 45:05.004
I think you need
to move around.

45:12.752 --> 45:15.469
Wow, this looks interesting.
What is it?

45:15.630 --> 45:17.136
I take it you're an art lover?

45:17.298 --> 45:18.423
<i>No serum.</i>

45:18.424 --> 45:19.635
Yeah, not so much.

45:23.429 --> 45:26.394
Oh, how about this
impressive trinket?

45:26.515 --> 45:28.391
I'd hardly call it
a trinket, Mr. Gru.

45:28.392 --> 45:29.976
<i>Nothing.</i>
The International...

45:29.977 --> 45:31.104
Yeah, I don't care.

45:37.109 --> 45:38.360
<i>Mee-maw! Mee-maw!</i>

45:38.361 --> 45:40.904
<i>Hold on, I'm picking up something.
Behind that wall!</i>

45:40.905 --> 45:42.614
Ah, and what do we have here?

45:42.615 --> 45:45.950
These are my trial wigs.
You should take one.

45:45.952 --> 45:49.329
No, thanks. So, what's on
the other side of the wall?

45:49.330 --> 45:50.664
Here you are!
Look at me! Focus!

45:50.665 --> 45:51.956
Gru?

45:51.958 --> 45:56.544
I promise that this wig will
transform you from ugly

45:56.545 --> 45:59.594
to irresistible.

46:00.257 --> 46:01.966
Margo has a boyfriend!

46:01.968 --> 46:04.052
And they're going on a date!

46:04.053 --> 46:05.470
Date? Boyfriend?

46:05.471 --> 46:06.682
What?

46:19.110 --> 46:20.237
There she goes!

46:32.206 --> 46:34.009
Oh, you're so funny.

46:34.166 --> 46:35.375
Gross!

46:35.376 --> 46:37.544
Look, they're in love.
Oh, no, no, no.

46:37.545 --> 46:40.004
Do not say that. No, no, no.

46:40.006 --> 46:44.426
And my dream is to one day
play video games for a living.

46:44.427 --> 46:46.219
Wow.

46:46.220 --> 46:48.388
You're so complicated.

46:48.389 --> 46:50.056
Margo.

46:50.057 --> 46:51.694
What is going on here?

46:52.393 --> 46:56.604
Oh, Gru, <i>se llama</i> Antonio.
<i>Me llamo</i> Margo.

46:56.605 --> 46:59.951
Me llama-lama ding-dong.
Who cares? Let's go.

47:06.240 --> 47:07.284
Whoa!

47:30.723 --> 47:32.479
Kids eat free on Tuesdays.

47:42.485 --> 47:43.528
Yay, Pop!

47:44.028 --> 47:45.618
That's awesome!

47:47.281 --> 47:51.242
So good to see you again, <i>mi compadre!</i>
Ha! Yeah.

47:51.243 --> 47:53.711
Oh, I see you have
already met my father.

47:54.080 --> 47:56.039
What? Father?

47:56.040 --> 47:59.542
Si. Look at this crazy
small world we live in, eh?

47:59.543 --> 48:01.628
Come, sit,
let me get you something.

48:03.297 --> 48:05.465
Oh, look at you.
Heh?

48:06.926 --> 48:09.844
He likes me.

48:09.845 --> 48:13.807
Oh, oh! I'm sorry. Pollito
is usually very friendly.

48:13.808 --> 48:15.398
He had a rough night.

48:18.938 --> 48:21.731
Well, we really should be going.
Girls, come on.

48:21.732 --> 48:23.608
That is a pity.

48:23.609 --> 48:26.402
Young love is beautiful, no?

48:26.403 --> 48:27.779
No!

48:27.780 --> 48:31.327
You know, they're not in love.
They hardly know each other.

48:32.159 --> 48:34.378
You are right, <i>Cabeza de huevo.</i>

48:34.537 --> 48:36.830
They must get to
know each other better!

48:36.831 --> 48:41.000
Antonio, why don't you invite
your girlfriend and her family

48:41.001 --> 48:42.710
to our <i>Cinco de Mayo</i> party?

48:42.711 --> 48:44.003
No, no.

48:44.004 --> 48:45.096
Si!

48:59.728 --> 49:02.146
I'm sorry, El Macho?

49:02.148 --> 49:04.153
Hadn't we
eliminated him as a suspect

49:04.316 --> 49:06.401
after the whole salsa incident?

49:06.402 --> 49:08.987
Yes, but there has
been a new development,

49:08.988 --> 49:12.156
and I'm telling you,
this is the guy.

49:12.158 --> 49:14.659
You need to
arrest him immediately.

49:14.660 --> 49:18.246
And his deviously charming son!

49:18.247 --> 49:21.249
I'm pretty sure that
the son is involved, too.

49:21.250 --> 49:23.931
The son, also!
You got to get the son!

49:24.086 --> 49:27.672
I think that
the son is the mastermind!

49:27.673 --> 49:29.643
There's a look,
there's a devilish look

49:29.800 --> 49:31.885
in his eyes,
and I don't like it!

49:31.886 --> 49:34.095
Yes, but I don't
really see any evidence.

49:34.096 --> 49:35.930
Evidence, schmevidence.
I go with my gut,

49:35.931 --> 49:39.684
and my gut tells me
that this guy is El Macho.

49:39.685 --> 49:42.270
Lock him up, lock up the son.

49:42.271 --> 49:46.198
Don't forget about the son.
The kid gives me the creeps!

49:46.358 --> 49:48.363
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

49:48.527 --> 49:53.451
But, on the less
crazy side of things,

49:53.824 --> 49:56.838
Gru discovered traces of the
serum at Eagle Hair Club!

49:57.411 --> 49:59.162
Hmm, interesting.

49:59.163 --> 50:01.456
Yeah! And you know
who made that happen? Huh?

50:01.457 --> 50:04.834
This guy.
Nailed it. Amazing, right?

50:04.835 --> 50:08.713
No, I mean, sure. But it's
not him, it is El Macho!

50:08.714 --> 50:10.757
Mr. Gru, please!

50:10.758 --> 50:13.605
No! It is him,
and I will prove it!

50:15.179 --> 50:17.350
Gru, come on!

50:19.934 --> 50:22.104
He really thinks it's El Macho.

50:22.937 --> 50:24.324
Can you tell?

50:48.837 --> 50:50.474
Oh. Whoo!

51:27.584 --> 51:28.842
Give me that!

51:36.969 --> 51:39.899
Kevin, the Wi-Fi's out!

51:40.264 --> 51:41.817
Kevin?

51:41.974 --> 51:44.642
Hey, Lance,
where the heck is Kevin?

51:45.811 --> 51:50.314
All right, we need to revisit the
number of vacation days you guys get.

51:50.316 --> 51:52.700
I can't find anybody anymore.

51:53.402 --> 51:55.454
Gru, it's Jillian!

51:56.488 --> 51:58.328
I've got good news!

51:58.490 --> 52:00.626
I have my friend
Shannon here with me.

52:00.784 --> 52:02.994
I was thinking you
two could get some grub.

52:02.995 --> 52:06.293
You know, tear it up, see what happens!

52:06.915 --> 52:08.124
Open up!

52:08.125 --> 52:09.292
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la, la...</i>

52:09.293 --> 52:12.757
Agnes! Agnes,
tell Jillian I'm not here.

52:13.005 --> 52:14.505
Gru's not here.

52:14.506 --> 52:16.340
Are you sure?

52:16.342 --> 52:17.925
Yes, he just told me!

52:19.053 --> 52:20.096
Mmm-mmm!

52:20.346 --> 52:22.305
I mean,
no, he didn't just tell me.

52:23.474 --> 52:25.728
Agnes, where is Gru?

52:27.102 --> 52:29.024
He's putting on lipstick!

52:30.272 --> 52:31.909
He's swatting at flies!

52:32.107 --> 52:33.151
No! No!

52:33.317 --> 52:34.740
He's chopping his head off!

52:36.737 --> 52:39.157
He's pooping?

52:39.907 --> 52:41.912
I know you're in there, Gru!

52:42.076 --> 52:45.539
There's no way you're
getting out of this!

52:50.959 --> 52:54.170
I have to tell you, I
was so nervous about tonight.

52:54.171 --> 52:57.386
I mean there's just so
many phonies out there!

52:58.050 --> 53:00.933
Yes, I hear you.

53:02.012 --> 53:03.513
Oh, so, do you work out?

53:03.514 --> 53:04.680
Well...

53:04.681 --> 53:07.565
I mean, obviously, you
don't, but would you consider it?

53:07.726 --> 53:11.395
Huh? Physical fitness is
very important to Shannon.

53:11.397 --> 53:13.199
As you can tell,
right? Huh?

53:14.358 --> 53:15.525
Ah.

53:15.526 --> 53:16.776
I can tell.

53:16.777 --> 53:17.985
Solid.

53:17.986 --> 53:20.572
We are in the restaurant,
you know.

53:22.533 --> 53:24.117
Hi. Takeout for Lucy?

53:24.118 --> 53:25.624
Sure, just a sec.

53:37.589 --> 53:40.967
<i>Your accent is so exotic.</i>

53:40.968 --> 53:43.261
Ah. Well, thank you very much.

53:43.262 --> 53:45.012
I know someone who
can fix that for you.

53:45.013 --> 53:47.778
And you'll be
talking normal in no time!

53:50.144 --> 53:52.362
Whoo. Is it hot in here?

53:54.273 --> 53:56.076
How's the food?

53:57.109 --> 54:00.862
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Are you wearing a wig?

54:00.863 --> 54:01.990
What?

54:02.656 --> 54:04.157
Ah! I don't think so.

54:04.158 --> 54:05.449
I knew it.

54:05.451 --> 54:07.743
You're a phony.
I hate phonies!

54:07.744 --> 54:09.996
Oh, what?
No. These locks are all mine.

54:09.997 --> 54:11.372
No, they're not!

54:11.373 --> 54:14.584
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm
gonna rip that thing off your head,

54:14.585 --> 54:17.545
and show everyone what a
bald-headed phony you are.

54:17.546 --> 54:18.757
I don't think so, Miss Lady.

54:28.515 --> 54:29.849
Hello?

54:29.850 --> 54:31.267
Hello? Are you...

54:31.268 --> 54:32.602
Hey, Gru.

54:32.603 --> 54:35.813
Hello, Lucy.
How are you doing?

54:35.814 --> 54:38.316
Wow, looks like your
date's out for the count.

54:38.317 --> 54:41.402
It's like she's been shot with
a mild moose tranquilizer.

54:46.992 --> 54:50.119
Yeah, I'm winking because
that's what actually happened.

54:50.120 --> 54:53.372
<i>Scusi,</i> what's happening here?
She no like?

54:53.373 --> 54:54.797
Oh, she's just, uh...

54:56.376 --> 54:57.627
Oh, ho.

54:57.628 --> 54:59.629
<i>Sì, Sì. Sì.</i>

54:59.630 --> 55:01.101
Shall we take her home?

55:12.226 --> 55:13.269
Oh!

55:43.465 --> 55:46.977
Well, I think you did it. You just
officially had the worst date ever.

55:47.261 --> 55:48.648
Huh, tell me about it.

55:49.012 --> 55:52.306
Don't worry. It can only get
better from here, right?

55:52.307 --> 55:54.517
But if it doesn't, you can
always borrow my dart gun.

55:54.518 --> 55:56.902
I've had to use it on
one or two dates myself.

55:57.104 --> 55:59.323
Yeah, you know,
as far as dates go,

55:59.481 --> 56:01.700
I think I'm good
with just the one.

56:05.529 --> 56:08.542
Well, good night, partner.

56:10.867 --> 56:12.201
This was fun.

56:12.202 --> 56:15.050
Yes. Surprisingly, it was.

56:15.539 --> 56:17.840
Oh, and, uh,
just between you and me?

56:18.458 --> 56:20.428
You look much better bald.

56:22.879 --> 56:24.303
See you tomorrow.

56:33.599 --> 56:35.182
Quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack!

56:40.606 --> 56:41.897
Yay!

56:41.898 --> 56:43.607
So, I take it
the date went well?

56:43.609 --> 56:45.863
No, it was horrible.

56:56.663 --> 56:59.048
High-five!

56:59.958 --> 57:01.251
Bump it.

57:43.502 --> 57:45.305
Mr. Ramsbottom?

57:45.462 --> 57:46.754
Oh, hello.

57:46.755 --> 57:48.214
What are you doing here?

57:48.215 --> 57:50.184
We got him.
Got who?

57:50.342 --> 57:51.895
Floyd Eaglesan!

57:52.052 --> 57:55.096
Our agents located a secret
room in his shop last night

57:55.097 --> 57:56.972
and discovered this.

57:56.973 --> 58:01.066
It's empty, but we found traces
of the PX-41 serum in it.

58:01.228 --> 58:02.645
He's our man.

58:02.646 --> 58:06.988
So, somehow, in spite of your
incompetence, we solved this one.

58:07.150 --> 58:08.776
I was framed!

58:08.777 --> 58:10.528
You won't get away with this!

58:10.529 --> 58:13.155
Get your mitts off of me!
I am a legitimate businessman.

58:13.156 --> 58:16.992
Ah. All right. So what now?

58:16.993 --> 58:20.090
Well, now you're free to
go back to your business.

58:20.330 --> 58:22.549
Mmm. Jams and jellies.

58:22.749 --> 58:24.671
And it looks like
Agent Wilde will be

58:24.835 --> 58:26.756
transferring to our
Australian branch.

58:27.504 --> 58:28.596
Australia?

58:28.755 --> 58:29.882
Yes.

58:30.048 --> 58:31.882
But thank you for everything.

58:31.883 --> 58:34.802
And by everything,
of course I mean nothing.

58:34.803 --> 58:37.389
Toodle pip and cheerio,
Mr. Gru.

58:41.893 --> 58:44.186
Hey, there.
Hey.

58:44.187 --> 58:45.688
So, we got him.

58:45.689 --> 58:48.858
Yay. That's great.

58:48.859 --> 58:50.776
And now you're
going to Australia?

58:50.777 --> 58:53.654
Well, it's not definite yet.
I'm still figuring it out.

58:53.655 --> 58:55.865
I've already been
working on my accent.

58:55.866 --> 58:58.117
Wallaby. Didgeridoo.

58:58.118 --> 59:00.835
Hugh Jackman.

59:01.204 --> 59:04.586
So, um... Pretty excited.

59:05.667 --> 59:07.168
Great.

59:07.169 --> 59:09.628
Well, good luck.

59:09.629 --> 59:12.394
Thanks. You, too.

59:13.175 --> 59:16.051
Oh! Here.
I wanted to give you this.

59:16.052 --> 59:17.928
Your lipstick taser?

59:17.929 --> 59:19.930
Yeah, it's just a memento.

59:19.931 --> 59:23.942
Just, you know,
from the first time we met.

59:24.186 --> 59:26.321
Oh. Thank you, Lucy.

59:27.189 --> 59:28.660
Agent Wilde.

59:29.149 --> 59:32.359
Well, it looks like
they need you, so...

59:32.360 --> 59:35.125
Yeah, I better go.

59:36.239 --> 59:37.627
Bye, Gru.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:16.080
I brought you an umbrella.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:21.116
Ah, thank you.

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:22.708
What are you doing out here?

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:27.379
Remember when you
said that I liked Lucy?

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:31.008
Well, it turns out,

01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:32.427
you're right.

01:00:33.129 --> 01:00:34.221
Really?

01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:35.810
Yes, but...

01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:39.009
Well, she's moving away.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:41.810
I'm never going
to see her again.

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:47.646
Is there anything
I could do to help?

01:00:48.228 --> 01:00:51.775
Aw, I don't... I don't
think so, sweetheart.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:55.615
Well, is there
anything you could do?

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:59.947
Hello, Lucy. This is Gru.

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:02.629
I know up to this
point our relationship

01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:05.536
has been strictly professional,

01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:09.843
and you're leaving for
Australia and all, but...

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.049
Okay, here is the question.

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:14.801
Would you like to...

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:19.435
To go out on a date?

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.683
Uh, no.

01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:24.096
Okay, that's not helping.

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:27.063
All right, here we go.
For real this time.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:38.368
I can do this.

01:01:57.088 --> 01:01:58.299
Agh! I hate you!

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:03.221
Ah.

01:02:58.566 --> 01:02:59.610
Eh.

01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:02.528
Kevin?
Mmm?

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:03.904
Tom?

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:04.997
Hello!

01:03:05.573 --> 01:03:07.408
<i>Kampai!
Kampai!</i>

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:08.619
Huh? <i>Kampai!</i>

01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:21.632
Bah!

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:26.979
Oh.

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:32.270
<i>Cinco de May-ya-yo!
Cinco de May-ya-yo!</i>

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:42.484
Whoa!

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.490
This place is awesome!

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.158
Okay. Let's party, huh?

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:51.952
But first,
let's go over the rules.

01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:55.289
Because what is fun
without the rules?

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:57.010
Agnes, easy on the churros.

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:59.178
Edith, try not to kill anyone.
<i>Hai!</i>

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:00.794
Margo!

01:04:00.795 --> 01:04:01.922
Hello, Mr. Gru.

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:03.381
Okay.

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:05.009
Gru!

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:10.095
There must be the standard 6 feet
of space between you and boys.

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:12.014
Especially this boy.

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:15.023
Ah, you are a funny man.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:17.949
There are no rules, <i>señor.</i>
It's <i>Cinco de Mayo.</i>

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:20.439
Come on!
They're starting the dance!

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.947
<i>Arriba!</i>

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:23.547
So glad you could
make it, <i>mi</i> compadre.

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:25.546
Hey, what's wrong?

01:05:25.547 --> 01:05:27.631
Oh, nothing.
Nothing is wrong.

01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:32.389
I'm just chilling with the
guac, from my chip hat.

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:38.767
Gru, please. I know
that look all too well.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:41.270
It is the look
of a broken heart.

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:42.688
How did you know?

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:46.275
Believe me, my friend,
I too have spent many nights

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:49.953
trying to drown my
sorrows in guacamole.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.367
You?
Yes.

01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:56.088
But we are survivors.

01:05:56.244 --> 01:06:00.337
There's much more to
us than meets the eye.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:02.879
Enjoy the party.

01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:57.640
Huh.

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:20.749
Ah-ha!

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.084
Ouch!

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:43.274
Say what?

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:59.324
Would you like some
peanuts or pretzels?

01:08:03.955 --> 01:08:05.794
That's a good joke.

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:12.220
I just did a boom boom.

01:08:13.798 --> 01:08:16.017
I really need you to
make a choice, hon.

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:19.058
I choose Gru.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:21.898
I choose Gru!

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.488
Thank you, Gru stewardess!

01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:29.318
You're welcome!

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:48.751
Aah!

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:06.515
You have not lost
your touch, my friend.

01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:08.894
Ah-ha! I knew it!

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:10.484
You are El Macho!

01:09:10.645 --> 01:09:12.782
That's right!

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:14.691
Nobody believed me!

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:16.609
Ho-ho! But I knew
you weren't dead!

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:21.408
Of course not.
I merely faked my death.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.493
But now, it's time for me

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:28.456
to make
a spectacular return to evil.

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:34.419
Doctor, I think it's time we
showed Gru what we're up to here.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.587
Dr. Nefario?

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:38.760
Nice to see you, Gru.

01:09:39.425 --> 01:09:40.550
Wha...?

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:43.636
So, this is your
new job opportunity?

01:09:43.638 --> 01:09:46.603
Absolutely.
You're gonna like this.

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:52.773
Sorry.

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:56.694
I had to borrow some of your minions,
but it was for a worthy cause.

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:59.820
Oh! Kevin!

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:02.289
No, he's not Kevin anymore.

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:07.536
Now he is an indestructible,
mindless killing machine!

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:08.580
Bah!

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.544
Just watch this.

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:25.303
Bah!

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:27.191
And here's the best part!

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:30.569
I got an army of them!

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:34.700
Look, look, look!

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:42.781
Bah!

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:47.242
Soon I will unleash
them on the world,

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:51.413
and if anyone,
anyone tries to stop them...

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:52.581
Yeow!

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:55.132
...their city gets eaten!

01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:57.216
We can do it together.

01:10:57.462 --> 01:10:58.628
Together?

01:10:58.629 --> 01:10:59.673
Together!

01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:03.133
I have admired your
work for years, amigo.

01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:06.636
Stealing the Moon!
Are you kidding?

01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:08.892
We would be unstoppable!

01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:11.607
Men like you, men like me.

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:15.860
We should be ruling the world!

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:17.742
So, are you in?

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:19.318
Woo-hoo!

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:21.740
Uh, yeah, probably.

01:11:22.153 --> 01:11:23.363
Probably?

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:26.239
I mean, yes, yes!
Of course, yes.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.117
I just have a lot
going on right now.

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:31.953
I just need to get
some things off my plate

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:35.252
before we start taking over
the world, that's all.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.261
Excuse me?
No, forget it.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.592
One hundred percent! I am in!

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:43.924
I think...
Do you hear that? I do.

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:47.555
That's Agnes calling
me from on the surface.

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:51.861
Totally in!

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:55.018
You know what?

01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:57.569
I am not so
convinced that he is in.

01:12:09.408 --> 01:12:11.493
Edith, Agnes, come on! Ooh!

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:12.661
Oops, sorry.

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:14.412
We need to go home now.
Where is Margo?

01:12:14.413 --> 01:12:16.050
But I didn't get a turn!

01:12:22.713 --> 01:12:23.757
Margo!

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:26.178
Come on. We're leaving...

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:28.134
Hey, what's wrong?

01:12:28.135 --> 01:12:29.726
I hate boys.

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:35.016
Yes. They stink.

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:37.188
Uh, sorry. Honey,
we got to go.

01:13:00.334 --> 01:13:01.841
Oops! Sorry.

01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:08.468
Ya!

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:16.391
Hey! Pollito,
what's the matter?

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:17.600
Oh, hey, Eduardo!

01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:19.519
Lucia, I apologize.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:22.355
Pollito,
he's usually not like this.

01:13:22.356 --> 01:13:27.031
The same thing happened the
other day with Gru, and...

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:33.700
Oh, well, speaking of Gru, um, have you seen him?
I really need to talk to him.

01:13:33.701 --> 01:13:36.911
Yes. I think he's
somewhere around here.

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:38.834
You two are close, no?

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:40.623
Oh, I don't know.

01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:44.044
I mean, "close,"
I wouldn't say we were close.

01:13:44.045 --> 01:13:46.129
Why, did he say we were close?
Did he say that?

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:48.715
It's more what he didn't say.

01:13:48.716 --> 01:13:52.135
For instance,
he never mentioned

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:55.268
that you were both working
for the Anti-Villain League!

01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:58.224
You're coming with me.

01:13:58.225 --> 01:13:59.269
Hey!

01:14:00.561 --> 01:14:01.902
Crikey!

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:10.528
So, Eduardo's
actually El Macho?

01:14:10.529 --> 01:14:11.787
Cool!

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:13.281
No, it is not cool!

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:15.742
Plus, I pretty much
knew it was him all along,

01:14:15.743 --> 01:14:17.827
so if anyone's cool, it's me!

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:20.914
<i>Gru!</i>

01:14:20.915 --> 01:14:23.041
Well, Dr. Nefario.

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:25.877
<i>El Macho's onto you. He knows
you're working for the AVL.</i>

01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:27.800
<i>And he's got your partner.</i>

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:29.768
Lucy?

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:33.218
That's impossible.
She's on her way to Australia!

01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:34.427
<i>Nefario?</i>

01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:35.852
<i>Sorry, gotta go!</i>

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:38.897
He's got Lucy?

01:14:40.017 --> 01:14:41.571
Not for long.

01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:44.154
Come on, we're
getting her out of there.

01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:14.152
What was that?

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:27.208
I don't see anything.

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:42.354
Run!

01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:43.934
My unicorn!

01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:45.446
Agnes, no!

01:17:19.426 --> 01:17:21.182
Come on! Hurry!

01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:25.856
What's the matter?

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:32.607
Bah!

01:17:43.117 --> 01:17:44.161
<i>Ooh là là.</i>

01:17:46.954 --> 01:17:48.246
Kevin!

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:52.505
Dr. Nefario! You're back!

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:54.306
In the flesh.

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:57.556
Behold, the antidote.

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:04.890
Come on. Let's finally put this
horrible jelly to some good use.

01:18:16.317 --> 01:18:17.817
Ah! Ah!

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:23.042
Hey, guys, come on!
Stay focused here.

01:18:33.792 --> 01:18:34.836
Huh?

01:18:35.002 --> 01:18:36.253
Huh?

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.175
Uh...

01:18:45.888 --> 01:18:47.857
Uh...

01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:49.351
Oh.

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:02.528
Uh!

01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:07.582
Curses! Foiled again!

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:10.247
These guys captured me!

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:44.112
Uh...

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:45.370
No?

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:48.326
Bah!

01:19:49.034 --> 01:19:50.078
Run!

01:19:59.169 --> 01:20:00.462
Up that tree!

01:20:01.672 --> 01:20:02.882
Hurry! Hurry!

01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:05.818
Hello, Gru!

01:21:05.819 --> 01:21:09.082
Hey hey!
Nice work, Dr. Nefario!

01:21:09.406 --> 01:21:11.411
I put an antidote in the jelly.

01:21:11.909 --> 01:21:15.953
I mean, I'm happy to create an
evil army to destroy the world,

01:21:15.954 --> 01:21:18.754
but nobody
messes with my family.

01:21:18.916 --> 01:21:20.802
Thank you, Doctor.

01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:22.846
Now, let's go get the...

01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:25.298
Hi!

01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:26.757
You brought the girls?

01:21:26.924 --> 01:21:28.217
Yes!

01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:29.634
Oh.

01:21:29.635 --> 01:21:31.106
Was that wrong?

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:43.731
What's happening to my minions?

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:44.859
Gru?

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:49.654
You guys, take care of
the rest of the minions.

01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:51.660
I'm going to find Lucy.

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:04.593
Eat jelly, you purple freaks!

01:22:04.711 --> 01:22:06.432
Whoa! Whoa!

01:22:34.074 --> 01:22:35.741
It's over, El Macho.

01:22:35.742 --> 01:22:37.130
Now, where is Lucy?

01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:39.788
Let me show you.

01:22:52.384 --> 01:22:53.968
Oh, hey, Gru!

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:57.555
Turns out you were right about
the whole El Macho thing, huh?

01:22:57.556 --> 01:22:58.897
Yay!

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:03.060
One push of this button,
and I send that rocket

01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:07.565
straight into the same volcano
where I faked my death.

01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:10.568
Only this time, it's for real.

01:23:10.569 --> 01:23:11.613
No!

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:13.654
Yam

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:14.948
Tallyho!

01:23:21.955 --> 01:23:25.633
We could have ruled
the world together, Gru!

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:27.556
But now,

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:29.634
you're gonna die.

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:55.618
Oh!

01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:16.010
Ah!

01:24:42.452 --> 01:24:44.912
Mmm, lipstick taser!

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:47.132
Aw, he copied me.

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:57.758
I am not afraid
of your jelly guns.

01:24:57.759 --> 01:25:01.220
Oh, this ain't
a jelly gun, sunshine.

01:25:09.563 --> 01:25:10.607
Ho-oh!

01:25:15.277 --> 01:25:17.445
Don't worry about me,
Gru, I'll be fine.

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:19.989
I have survived
lots worse than this.

01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:21.662
Okay, that's not entirely true.

01:25:21.825 --> 01:25:23.576
I'm actually kind of
freaking out up here!

01:25:23.577 --> 01:25:25.664
Don't worry,
I will get you out of this.

01:25:34.212 --> 01:25:36.383
I really hate that chicken.

01:26:01.573 --> 01:26:03.658
Is there a red one?
It's usually the red one!

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:08.842
Gru, anytime now!

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:13.334
Listen, Lucy, we may not
get out of this alive,

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:15.711
so I need to
ask you a question.

01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:16.804
Uh, better make it quick.

01:26:17.297 --> 01:26:20.726
If I had asked you out on a
date, what would you have said?

01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:22.510
Are you kidding me?

01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:23.554
Yes!

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:26.938
Jump!

01:26:39.569 --> 01:26:41.041
Lucy!

01:26:41.696 --> 01:26:43.915
Lucy, where are you?

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:48.413
Oh, Lucy!

01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:50.295
Gru!

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:58.137
Sorry! I guess you need your
arms to tread water, huh?

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:08.359
They'll be back.

01:27:38.753 --> 01:27:41.553
<i>Underwear...</i>

01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:52.612
<i>Underwear...</i>

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:04.124
<i>Underwear...</i>

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.624
Oh!

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:23.009
Can I be
the first to say, "Ew!"

01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:26.594
<i>Underwear...</i>

01:28:42.234 --> 01:28:43.325
Okay.

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:45.743
Excuse me.

01:28:47.614 --> 01:28:49.500
Um, hi, excuse me.

01:28:57.249 --> 01:28:58.292
Uh,

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:02.511
hi, everybody.
I'd like to make some toast.

01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:03.673
Uh...

01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:06.263
Okay.

01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:08.842
She, um...

01:29:08.843 --> 01:29:13.103
She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair.

01:29:13.223 --> 01:29:16.070
We love you,
mothers, everywhere.

01:29:16.559 --> 01:29:19.906
And my new mom,
Lucy, is beyond compare.

01:29:20.105 --> 01:29:21.148
Aww.

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:22.483
Aw.

01:29:29.489 --> 01:29:31.577
To the bride and Gru!

01:29:52.262 --> 01:29:53.306
Yeah!

01:30:04.983 --> 01:30:07.533
Woo-hoo!
I'm so happy!

01:30:17.579 --> 01:30:18.623
Huh? Ha!

01:30:31.051 --> 01:30:32.094
Bah!

01:30:53.782 --> 01:30:54.992
Hey, Bob! Stuart!

01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:28.364
Eh!

01:31:28.942 --> 01:31:29.985
No?

01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:32.947
Ah!

01:31:36.116 --> 01:31:37.282
Bob!

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:46.043
Uh-oh!

01:32:00.265 --> 01:32:02.186
Okay.

01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:31.464
Okay.

01:32:49.272 --> 01:32:50.316
Aah!

01:33:39.948 --> 01:33:41.704
Mmm?
Shh!

01:33:51.668 --> 01:33:53.174
Blah.
