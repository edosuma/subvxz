00:36.904 --> 00:38.337
Lex...

00:39.373 --> 00:43.400
...I thought we had an arrangement.
Why this sudden urge for a face-to-face?

00:46.714 --> 00:48.477
You don't look well.

00:49.050 --> 00:52.281
Why did you pull me away from
my research? I hate progress reports.

00:52.453 --> 00:55.047
I hear you're having
personnel problems at Cadmus Labs.

00:55.222 --> 00:58.055
They quit when you turned violent,
started throwing equipment.

00:58.225 --> 01:01.160
No. They were incompetent.
I thought our relationship was clear.

01:01.328 --> 01:04.229
You write the checks,
I have free rein to do my work.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.559
I hired you to research the meteor rocks.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.259
Instead of results,
you provide potential lawsuits.

01:09.437 --> 01:12.099
Frankly, doctor, you've become a liability.

01:13.674 --> 01:17.337
Look, I'm afraid we've reached
the end of our road together.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.378
Now that I'm running my own company,
I don't have time...

01:20.548 --> 01:22.607
...to pursue projects that don't bear fruit.

01:23.317 --> 01:26.445
I suggest you see a doctor.
I'll take care of the expenses.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.851
I don't need your doctor,
and I sure don't need your condescension.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.457
It's you who needs me.
You're just a little too...

01:33.027 --> 01:35.427
...myopic to see it.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.974
Hey, man. Are you all right?

05:08.809 --> 05:12.745
Clark, you're dreaming if you think
you're gonna make a basket from there.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.676
No, no, the ball rolled out here.

05:16.217 --> 05:19.709
- Wanna play a game of horse?
- Forget it. We're borrowing your dad's truck.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.355
- For what?
- I'll explain on the way. There's no time.

05:22.523 --> 05:26.015
- What's going on?
- You gotta see it with your own eyes.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.664
Pretty mind-blowing, huh?

05:40.341 --> 05:41.603
What do you think it is?

05:41.909 --> 05:45.003
Oh, Clark, it's a spaceship.
What the hell else would it be?

05:45.179 --> 05:49.240
I didn't know if it was some downed
specialty aircraft or a Russian satellite.

05:49.417 --> 05:52.614
No, no, no, this thing's got
extraterrestrial written all over it.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.690
I bet there's little green guys
running around the cornfield too.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.753
I'm serious, Clark.
Have you ever seen anything like it?

06:00.861 --> 06:03.887
If aliens came, they'd find a place
more exciting than Smallville.

06:04.065 --> 06:07.398
No, no, think about it.
Crop circles, cattle mutilation.

06:07.568 --> 06:11.629
They'd be like kids in a candy store here.
Come on, man, let's load it into the truck.

06:11.806 --> 06:14.434
- Wait, you're not just gonna take it.
- Clark.

06:14.642 --> 06:18.476
When the sheriff questioned me, I told him
I couldn't remember where the truck...

06:18.646 --> 06:22.047
...went off the road, but it's only
a matter of time before he shows up.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.017
Come on.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.584
- Come on.
- All right, we'll take it to my house.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.587
No, Clark. I know your dad.

06:30.758 --> 06:33.955
- He'll make us give it to the authorities.
- He won't know it's there.

06:43.671 --> 06:46.071
Clark, last time I checked,
I found this thing.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.368
You're acting like you got license
and registration on it, man.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.408
Lighten up. We're taking it to my place.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.252
Right here.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.419
Lex?

07:11.732 --> 07:13.825
- Are you in here?
- Yeah, Dad, I'm right here.

07:14.235 --> 07:16.135
I'm sorry, I wasn't expecting you.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.771
No. Get out.

07:20.374 --> 07:21.966
Is everything all right?

07:24.044 --> 07:26.012
Doctors tell me
your recovery's going well.

07:26.180 --> 07:29.343
Oh, it is. So well, in fact, that...

07:29.517 --> 07:31.644
...Dr. Rawlings suggested I...

07:31.952 --> 07:33.613
...take a break from the...

07:33.988 --> 07:35.717
...rigors of...

07:36.157 --> 07:38.148
...physical therapy. He...

07:38.392 --> 07:40.883
He thought that some time away from the...

07:41.195 --> 07:44.926
...stress of living and working
in Metropolis would be more...

07:45.399 --> 07:46.730
...beneficial right now.

07:47.501 --> 07:50.402
And of all the places
you could have gone...

07:50.905 --> 07:53.874
...you decided to come here?
- We'll have a chance for some...

07:54.108 --> 07:58.568
...father-son bonding. You've always told
me I've been lax in that department, Lex.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.636
How long you planning to stay?

08:00.814 --> 08:03.339
A few days. Maybe a week.

08:05.452 --> 08:08.421
Are you sure you wouldn't be
more comfortable at the beach house?

08:08.889 --> 08:10.880
I think the sea air would be invigorating.

08:11.892 --> 08:16.420
I'm getting the distinct impression, Lex,
that you don't want me here.

08:17.298 --> 08:20.893
No, Father, I just want what's best for you.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.402
Stay as long as you like.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.051
No.

08:45.459 --> 08:47.086
Hey, Lana, I was just thinking...

08:47.261 --> 08:51.322
...if you moved those tables away from the
counter, it'd open up space for extra stools.

08:51.498 --> 08:54.934
- More customers, more cash flow.
- That's a wonderful idea, Dean.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.402
I gotta go.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.607
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.905
- Bye, Lana.
- Bye.

09:09.550 --> 09:13.748
- Isn't he wonderful?
- Yeah. He's great.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.223
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.382
- Hi, Chloe.
- Hi.

09:19.627 --> 09:23.154
Oh, how did the sleepover go?
Did you two get a lot of studying done?

09:23.664 --> 09:27.122
I have to be completely honest
with you, Nell.

09:29.036 --> 09:33.405
We didn't study.
We had a Keanu DVD-a-thon.

09:34.842 --> 09:38.676
Once you get lost in those brown eyes,
geometry loses its appeal.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.414
Well, I'm just glad you two had fun.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.447
Don't let the grades suffer.

09:44.618 --> 09:47.451
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

09:49.490 --> 09:51.424
Thank you so much, Chloe.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.321
Sure. If you'd given me a heads-up...

09:53.494 --> 09:56.986
...I could've come up with something
a lot better than a Keanu DVD-a-thon.

09:57.164 --> 10:01.601
Sorry, I had to get out of the house, so
I told Nell I was staying at a friend's place.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.101
You were the first person
that came to mind.

10:04.338 --> 10:05.965
- Really?
- Really.

10:07.241 --> 10:09.300
So where were you last night?

10:09.476 --> 10:11.603
Is there a new guy in Lana Lang's life?

10:11.912 --> 10:15.575
Yeah. His name's Dean.
You passed him on the way in.

10:16.550 --> 10:18.211
- You're dating an older man?
- Relax.

10:18.419 --> 10:22.617
He's Nell's boyfriend. He's an insurance
adjuster she met after the tornado.

10:22.790 --> 10:26.453
He's always around, and they're in this
lovey-dovey daze all the time.

10:26.694 --> 10:29.891
Yeah, and you want to tell them
to get a room, but it's her house.

10:30.064 --> 10:33.693
After I caught them slow dancing,
I decided to stay at the Talon.

10:33.867 --> 10:37.303
Next time you need to clear out of the
love shack, you don't have to lie.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.564
You can stay at my house for real, anytime.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.002
Thanks.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.683
- This thing weighs a ton.
- I know.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.983
- I'm gonna go call Chloe.
- Wait, wait, don't.

10:59.626 --> 11:02.254
Why not? To her, this thing's
like the Holy Grail.

11:03.097 --> 11:05.895
- She'll write an article.
- That's the point. We'll be famous.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.591
We'll write a book,
go on all sorts of talk shows...

11:08.802 --> 11:10.702
...and then we'll sign a big movie deal.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.668
Don't you think we should keep this
between us till we know more?

11:13.841 --> 11:17.174
Why are you gun-shy? We gotta
move before the driver tells someone else.

11:17.344 --> 11:21.610
Suppose we tell Chloe and it turns out to be
some high-tech crop-duster or something.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.510
She'll never let us live it down.

11:23.684 --> 11:27.711
Exactly. We'd be the subject of her next
"Eat Crow" column for sure.

11:28.622 --> 11:31.147
I don't know about you,
but I'm not willing to risk it.

11:31.325 --> 11:33.020
Well, how do you think you open it?

11:33.527 --> 11:36.257
I'm not sure. Here.

11:36.997 --> 11:40.728
You work on that. I'm gonna go see if
anyone's put up "missing spaceship" flyers.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.665
- I'll meet you back here tomorrow morning.
- All right, cool.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.635
So where is it now?

11:47.808 --> 11:50.276
- In Pete's tool shed.
- He hasn't told anyone about it?

11:50.444 --> 11:52.878
I convinced him to hold off
the press conference.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.446
Very funny.
We're just gonna have to get it back.

11:55.616 --> 11:57.846
What are we gonna do, Dad, just steal it?

11:59.019 --> 12:02.147
- What if he asks me where it went?
- You'll have to play dumb.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.086
- I'm sick of lying.
- You don't have much of a choice here.

12:05.259 --> 12:07.227
- Well, I can tell Pete the truth.
- Clark.

12:07.428 --> 12:08.725
He's not gonna tell anyone.

12:08.896 --> 12:12.127
Look, people slip sometimes,
even the most trustworthy of friends.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.290
This information is too dangerous for Pete.

12:14.468 --> 12:17.062
We understand that this secret
is a huge burden...

12:17.237 --> 12:18.966
...but if you share it with Pete...

12:19.139 --> 12:22.905
...you might be giving him
a responsibility he's not ready to take on.

12:26.847 --> 12:30.943
I know this isn't the type of bizarre cellular
mutation I normally call you with...

12:31.151 --> 12:33.881
...but I knew you'd be interested.
- What's the room number?

12:34.087 --> 12:38.046
You know, the interest
on my med-school loans is killing me.

12:43.363 --> 12:46.696
- You really should have that looked at.
- What's the number?

12:54.942 --> 12:56.204
Who are you?

12:58.812 --> 13:02.111
Dr. Hamilton. How do you feel?

13:02.282 --> 13:05.342
Like my head got bashed in by a bulldozer.

13:05.752 --> 13:10.815
Dr. Glenn tells me you saw a spacecraft
in a cornfield last night?

13:11.692 --> 13:13.489
Must have been babbling.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.295
They got me pumped full of morphine.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.397
Who else did you babble to?

13:19.933 --> 13:22.868
- What's it to you?
- Let's say I have a professional interest.

13:23.036 --> 13:27.735
I went to the field, I saw the impression in
the cornstalks. Whatever made it is gone.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.736
Damn.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.610
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.

13:34.715 --> 13:38.981
- Someone must have taken it.
- You did see a ship last night?

13:43.657 --> 13:44.919
Who else knows about it?

13:46.126 --> 13:47.650
No one.

13:50.030 --> 13:54.126
Oh, the kid, the one who
pulled me out of my truck.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.768
Pete Ross.

13:58.572 --> 14:01.234
- Have we met before?
- I don't think so.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.270
You were out on the road last night.

14:06.680 --> 14:10.275
You're the crazy son of a bitch
who forced me off the road.

14:15.756 --> 14:17.781
Nurse!

14:21.428 --> 14:23.157
What are you doing?

14:24.464 --> 14:25.897
Nurse!

14:42.983 --> 14:44.644
I don't believe it.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.317
Someone must have gotten here before us.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.887
Well, we're not gonna find out
who it was tonight.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.276
Pete.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.418
- Hey, I was just gonna come talk to you.
- Really?

15:20.187 --> 15:21.415
About the ship...

15:21.955 --> 15:24.753
Someone broke into my shed
last night and stole it.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.285
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.959
Did you tell anyone it was there?

15:31.164 --> 15:33.098
No. Did you?

15:35.669 --> 15:38.502
- No, my lips have been sealed.
- You're such a liar.

15:38.672 --> 15:42.164
- What do you mean?
- I saw you and your dad driving away.

15:42.442 --> 15:47.141
I kept telling myself, there's gotta be some
explanation. Clark Kent would never do this.

15:47.481 --> 15:49.381
Pete, I swear, we didn't take the ship.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.383
And all these years,
I used to think you were my best friend.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.849
Pete, wait. You don't understand.

15:56.023 --> 15:58.719
What don't I understand?
Go ahead, explain it to me, Clark.

16:01.428 --> 16:04.226
That's good, really illuminating.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.125
Wait till Chloe hears about this.

16:08.035 --> 16:11.266
I can already see the headlines:
"The Real Clark Kent Exposed."

16:35.962 --> 16:37.896
Pete, we need to talk.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.239
So you're some sort of...?
What, you're not a human?

16:49.176 --> 16:50.438
I don't know what I am.

16:50.610 --> 16:54.137
I don't know where that ship brought
me from. I grew up in Smallville...

16:54.347 --> 16:57.145
...and everything and everyone
that I care about is here.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.444
If you care about me,
how come you never told me?

16:59.619 --> 17:03.487
Believe me, I've always wanted to tell you.
My parents thought it was too dangerous.

17:03.657 --> 17:07.457
- Not just for me, but for anyone who knew.
- You didn't think I could handle it?

17:08.028 --> 17:09.858
Can you?

17:17.503 --> 17:19.131
Another reason I didn't say anything...

17:19.306 --> 17:22.434
...is because I knew people would
look at me the way you're looking at me.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.473
- Yeah, how's that?
- Like a freak.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.181
Pete, I've tried my whole life
just to blend in.

17:29.750 --> 17:32.082
I've tried to be more normal
than anyone else.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.582
Look, just say something.

17:37.224 --> 17:41.888
Call me... Call me an alien, call me
a monster. I don't care, just say something.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.864
It's like I don't even know you.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.437
Yes, you do. I'm the same kid
who used to camp in your backyard.

17:51.605 --> 17:56.599
We used to ride bikes, play basketball
with your brothers. Nothing has changed.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.107
- Yeah, right.
- Pete.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.577
Back off, man.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.487
Pete, I would never hurt you.

18:09.523 --> 18:10.990
Too late.

18:34.147 --> 18:37.139
There it is. Right there.

18:37.317 --> 18:41.219
Listen, I thought I made it clear
that our business together was over.

18:41.388 --> 18:45.654
I've come for my severance package. The
octagonal disk that I found in the field, Lex.

18:45.826 --> 18:48.386
- Why?
- What does it matter to you?

18:48.562 --> 18:50.894
I don't have it.
It disappeared during the storm.

18:51.064 --> 18:53.828
Liar! It's a key! I know you have it!

18:55.936 --> 18:57.460
This isn't over.

19:11.685 --> 19:13.482
- Mr. Luthor?
- Yes.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.177
I'm Dr. Steven Hamilton.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.516
I've been doing
confidential research on the...

19:17.757 --> 19:20.453
...meteor rocks for your son
at Cadmus Labs.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.686
All right, you've got my attention.

19:22.863 --> 19:25.661
Well, unfortunately, Lex has become...

19:26.066 --> 19:30.002
...shortsighted and impatient.
We've severed our relationship. But you...

19:30.170 --> 19:32.502
You have a reputation as a...

19:33.106 --> 19:35.438
- A man of vision.
- Apparently, doctor...

19:35.609 --> 19:37.440
...you haven't noticed that I'm blind.

19:37.878 --> 19:40.972
A man like you doesn't have to have eyes
to see the future...

19:41.147 --> 19:42.705
...or to recognize a opportunity.

19:42.883 --> 19:46.011
- Don't flatter me. Get to the point.
- I discovered something that...

19:46.186 --> 19:50.748
...can only be described as earth-shattering,
and I'd like to show it to you.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.326
Come on.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.191
Hey, Pete.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.870
Look, I know you freaked out.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.131
Don't you think
I freak myself out sometimes?

20:09.843 --> 20:12.903
All right, look, you have every reason
in the world to hate me...

20:13.079 --> 20:15.138
...but I need to find that ship.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.176
The guy you pulled out of the truck
must've told someone. I thought maybe...

20:22.355 --> 20:26.849
The other day, when we were moving the
ship, you said it was heavy. You were lying.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.819
You'd miss the bus and end up
at school ahead of me.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.861
You said you got a ride,
but you never got rides, did you?

20:34.067 --> 20:36.831
Our whole life, you were the person
I could tell anything...

20:37.003 --> 20:40.769
...and I did, all my secrets. But you,
everything you ever told me was a lie!

20:41.041 --> 20:44.067
Maybe I was right in not telling you,
the way you're reacting.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.774
Clark, you don't get it, do you?
I don't care if you're from the moon.

20:47.948 --> 20:50.416
You never trusted me.
What kind of friendship is that?

20:50.583 --> 20:54.451
Hey, guys. Why didn't you tell me
about the superhero deal?

20:58.892 --> 21:02.089
Pete pulls a guy from a mangled truck
and rushes him to the hospital?

21:03.029 --> 21:05.395
That's got Torch exclusive
written all over it.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.763
So how about an interview?

21:07.934 --> 21:09.333
Maybe later.

21:09.502 --> 21:12.198
Your reluctance wouldn't be part of
a vast conspiracy...

21:12.372 --> 21:15.239
...designed to cover up a whole
spaceship thing, would it?

21:15.408 --> 21:17.842
- What?
- My source from the medical center called.

21:18.011 --> 21:23.142
He said the guy was rambling on about
some spacecraft that landed in a cornfield.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.181
You don't really believe that, do you?

21:25.352 --> 21:28.344
I don't know, not unless
Pete can corroborate the story.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.081
Sure, Chloe, I saw a spaceship.

21:32.058 --> 21:34.390
- I even met an alien.
- Really?

21:34.794 --> 21:38.855
- Would you like to describe it?
- Actually, he looks a lot like Clark.

21:42.002 --> 21:44.163
I thought aliens were little and green.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.840
I guess things aren't always
what you think they are.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.771
Okay, what's up with him?

21:54.347 --> 21:56.110
It's just guy stuff.

21:56.516 --> 22:00.384
You're not really looking into this story,
are you? It sounds like Inquisitor stuff.

22:00.553 --> 22:03.818
Maybe, but if there is some truth to it,
that's front-page news...

22:04.024 --> 22:05.651
...for the Daily Planet.

22:22.042 --> 22:25.978
- Lex?
- Your mom said it would be okay if I waited.

22:26.146 --> 22:27.443
Yeah, what's up?

22:28.048 --> 22:31.449
I just needed to get out of the mansion.
It's getting crowded.

22:32.585 --> 22:37.488
- Doesn't it have, like, 75 rooms?
- Well, my father takes up a lot of space.

22:40.260 --> 22:42.023
When's he going back to Metropolis?

22:43.096 --> 22:44.961
Not soon enough.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.558
Is he really being that difficult?

22:48.735 --> 22:51.363
Just the opposite.
He's the picture of civility.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.972
Says he wants to work on our relationship.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.005
Is that such a bad thing?

22:57.544 --> 23:01.810
He's lied to me so many times, it's hard to
believe he doesn't have an ulterior motive.

23:03.149 --> 23:05.549
- Maybe give him the benefit of the doubt.
- No, no.

23:05.718 --> 23:08.915
If a person's deceived me, I find it hard
to give him a second chance.

23:11.291 --> 23:15.694
By the way, you remember that paperweight
I had on my desk, the octagonal one?

23:17.397 --> 23:18.989
Kind of, why?

23:19.165 --> 23:21.599
Came up today,
made me wonder what happened to it.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.593
- When did you lose it?
- During the storm.

23:26.439 --> 23:30.205
Probably got carried away with all the
other debris from the mansion. You know?

23:32.078 --> 23:34.046
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.145
Good luck.

23:44.390 --> 23:48.690
Forgive my skepticism, doctor,
but for all I can tell, this could be...

23:48.862 --> 23:51.228
...a postmodern coffee table.

23:51.865 --> 23:54.834
Why should I believe you
that it's a spacecraft?

23:55.001 --> 23:58.562
The alloy you're touching is composed
of elements not on the periodic table.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.865
Certain chemicals in that alloy
are present in the meteor rocks.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.370
Get me the proof.

24:04.410 --> 24:05.877
Here.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.113
- Feel this?
- Yeah.

24:08.281 --> 24:09.578
There's a piece missing.

24:09.749 --> 24:13.947
Lex and I were investigating a meteor site,
and I found an octagonal-shaped disk...

24:14.120 --> 24:17.385
...that is the exact size and shape
of that impression.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.957
- And you think it was...?
- It was a key...

24:20.126 --> 24:23.254
...that opens the ship and will provide
the proof you're asking for.

24:23.429 --> 24:26.125
Unfortunately, Lex won't give it back to me.

24:26.299 --> 24:29.632
- Maybe Lex doesn't have the disk anymore.
- Where else would it be?

24:30.303 --> 24:33.067
If you can answer that question, doctor...

24:33.439 --> 24:35.600
...you just might get your funding.

24:52.525 --> 24:53.787
Lana?

24:54.827 --> 24:56.556
What are you doing?

24:56.729 --> 25:00.358
Just using your telescope to see
if it's safe to go home.

25:01.367 --> 25:02.857
Hiding from Nell.

25:04.070 --> 25:05.935
Her new boyfriend, Dean.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.830
Oh, you're not crazy about him.

25:08.441 --> 25:13.606
Oh, long story short, not really. But I'm a
terrible liar, so I've moved on to avoidance.

25:15.215 --> 25:17.376
Well, you've come to the right place.

25:20.787 --> 25:22.652
What's wrong?

25:27.360 --> 25:30.523
Have you ever had anyone resent you
for telling them the truth?

25:31.231 --> 25:32.926
Yeah.

25:33.566 --> 25:37.366
Whitney, when I told him how I felt
and we broke up.

25:41.174 --> 25:45.042
Wow, you really did it. I didn't think
you'd follow through on that.

25:48.448 --> 25:51.008
So do you think you'll ever be friends again?

25:52.151 --> 25:53.618
Someday.

25:53.786 --> 25:57.278
I hope. I just wish I'd been honest
with him sooner.

25:58.891 --> 26:03.351
Yeah, Pete and I, we had a big blowout.
I don't know if our friendship is gonna last.

26:03.596 --> 26:05.655
What did you guys fight about?

26:06.599 --> 26:08.396
I wish I could tell you.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.401
Typical.

26:12.672 --> 26:13.969
What?

26:15.208 --> 26:17.108
Clark Kent starts a discussion...

26:17.343 --> 26:19.208
...about telling the truth, no less...

26:19.379 --> 26:23.873
...and when it's his turn to open up,
everything is suddenly a deep, dark secret.

26:25.218 --> 26:27.516
Well, the stuff about Pete
is kind of personal.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.788
Unlike what I just told you about Whitney.

26:32.292 --> 26:36.422
Have you ever thought that some people are
more comfortable opening up than others?

26:36.596 --> 26:39.429
I don't think it's ever comfortable
for anyone.

26:42.135 --> 26:45.366
But if you care about somebody,
you owe it to them.

26:46.739 --> 26:49.435
Then you should talk to Nell,
tell her how you really feel.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.076
You're right, Clark.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.506
Hiding the truth only keeps people apart.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.143
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

27:27.814 --> 27:30.146
- There's a piece missing.
- You stole the spaceship?

27:30.316 --> 27:34.343
It's octagonal in shape, the size of my palm.
Tell me where it is!

27:34.520 --> 27:36.954
I know you. You're Dr. Hamilton.

27:38.591 --> 27:40.058
You don't know
who you're messing with!

27:40.226 --> 27:43.252
That spaceship belongs
to someone a lot tougher than you...

27:45.264 --> 27:48.028
- You know who it belongs to.
- Look, I don't know anything.

27:48.201 --> 27:49.600
Tell me. Tell me who it is!

28:03.416 --> 28:08.149
I checked the papers, the police wires and
UFO sites. There's no mention of the ship.

28:08.321 --> 28:10.585
I don't know if that makes me
relieved or worried.

28:10.757 --> 28:14.659
I was thinking about Ray Wallace.
If Pete visited him before he died, maybe...

28:14.827 --> 28:17.022
Maybe he told Pete something
that could help us.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.629
I assume it's a possibility.

28:18.898 --> 28:21.332
Clark, I want you to talk
to Pete one more time.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.496
I can't.

28:23.836 --> 28:25.463
Why?

28:27.974 --> 28:29.908
Pete's not speaking to me.

28:31.411 --> 28:33.538
What happened?

28:36.182 --> 28:38.707
Look, I don't want you guys
to freak out, all right?

28:41.154 --> 28:42.678
But I told Pete.

28:43.623 --> 28:45.113
Everything.

28:47.527 --> 28:50.052
- I didn't have a choice. He saw us...
- What do you mean?

28:50.229 --> 28:53.357
- You could have come to us first.
- And come up with another lie?

28:53.533 --> 28:57.526
Clark, at least tell us
Pete's not gonna tell anybody else.

28:59.806 --> 29:02.001
I'm not sure what he's gonna do.
He's upset.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.974
Hello.

29:08.381 --> 29:09.678
No, he's not here.

29:10.283 --> 29:13.980
Oh, no.
Okay, whatever we can do. Bye-bye.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.483
That was Pete's mother.
He's missing.

29:29.702 --> 29:32.170
This is a wonderful idea, Lana.

29:32.605 --> 29:36.701
I realize we haven't had much time alone
since I started seeing Dean.

29:37.143 --> 29:40.306
Actually, that's kind of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

29:40.780 --> 29:44.876
- Dean's a really, really great guy. It's just...
- Let me guess.

29:46.385 --> 29:49.047
You liked the tables the way they were.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.248
Am I that transparent?

29:52.558 --> 29:56.756
Well, I've already had a long talk with Dean,
and I told him you're very independent...

29:56.929 --> 29:59.989
...and before he goes offering
any more unsolicited advice...

30:00.166 --> 30:03.533
...he should...
Well, he should get to know you better.

30:03.703 --> 30:06.069
Thanks, Nell, I really appreciate that.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.630
Lana, your feelings
are very important to me...

30:10.009 --> 30:12.409
...and they're important to Dean too.

30:12.612 --> 30:15.410
That's why we'd both like
to spend more time together.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.572
The three of us, as a family.

30:18.784 --> 30:20.251
Family.

30:21.821 --> 30:25.757
Lana, Dean didn't want me to say anything
until we were all together...

30:26.058 --> 30:28.856
...but, well, you know me,
I can never keep a secret.

30:29.795 --> 30:31.695
Lana, Dean's asked me to marry him.

30:35.835 --> 30:38.326
- What did you say?
- I said yes.

30:46.779 --> 30:49.339
The spaceship, I need to know!

30:50.383 --> 30:51.873
Are you gonna tell me...

30:52.485 --> 30:53.747
...who this belongs to?

30:54.253 --> 30:58.587
Look, man, I was just fronting.
I was trying to scare you.

30:58.758 --> 31:01.386
- I have no clue whose ship that is.
- You're lying!

31:03.963 --> 31:06.056
Look, you're sick.

31:06.699 --> 31:09.361
Just let me go!
I'll bring back help.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.060
Sure. You think anyone's gonna help me?

31:12.305 --> 31:14.933
The doctors don't even have a name
for what's killing me!

31:15.107 --> 31:16.870
- You're dying?
- Yes.

31:17.076 --> 31:19.135
But not before I prove I am not some...

31:19.312 --> 31:23.043
...sideshow freak, a quack doctor who sells
meteor rocks on the side of the road.

31:23.215 --> 31:27.083
And if you don't tell me what I want
to know, then you're dying too!

31:31.157 --> 31:35.617
Hamilton reports finding large
concentrations of meteor fragments...

31:35.795 --> 31:40.255
...spread over a large area
south of County Highway 17.

31:40.433 --> 31:42.867
These fragments vary in circumference...

31:43.035 --> 31:47.802
...from 24 microns five to 500
and 62 millimeters.

31:47.974 --> 31:49.703
Interesting reading, Dad.

31:50.743 --> 31:54.509
Lex.
I didn't hear you come in.

31:54.981 --> 31:56.573
I'm surprised.

31:57.049 --> 32:01.110
Dr. Rawlings says he's seen improvement in
your other senses since you lost your sight.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.720
You spoke to Rawlings?

32:03.222 --> 32:06.988
Imagine my surprise when he told me how
worried he was that you'd gone AWOL...

32:07.159 --> 32:10.060
...and missed your last several
physical-therapy sessions.

32:10.396 --> 32:13.263
In fact, he says the worst thing
for you right now...

32:13.432 --> 32:16.026
...is to be away from your care providers.

32:16.802 --> 32:23.002
Do you have any idea how degrading it is
to be poked and prodded by therapists?

32:23.175 --> 32:25.643
How demeaning it is to be told...

32:25.811 --> 32:30.646
...by a Braille instructor, "One day, one day,
all this will feel natural"?

32:31.884 --> 32:34.409
You want the truth, Lex?

32:36.422 --> 32:41.086
I was tired of being treated like an object,
an invalid. I had to get away from that.

32:46.165 --> 32:49.657
You thought a couple days of oedipal
mano a mano would make you feel better?

32:49.835 --> 32:55.967
Your analogy's apt but flawed, Lex.
Blind Oedipus was the son, not the father.

32:58.611 --> 33:00.044
I'll go back to Metropolis.

33:01.313 --> 33:05.647
So your sudden interest in Dr. Hamilton
was really just a coincidence?

33:06.052 --> 33:07.883
I admit, I find his work...

33:08.054 --> 33:10.215
...intriguing.
- He's sick, possibly delusional.

33:10.389 --> 33:14.416
Never underestimate the value
of eccentrics and lunatics, Lex.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.720
Every Arthur needs his Merlin.

33:18.164 --> 33:20.894
Hamilton said that he found
some sort of...

33:21.500 --> 33:23.525
...disk and that you had it.

33:24.270 --> 33:26.170
- He's mistaken.
- Oh, even so...

33:26.338 --> 33:30.035
...I think it may have been a bit rash
to terminate his contract.

33:30.876 --> 33:32.935
Why do you say that?

33:33.112 --> 33:37.640
Have you taken a look
in the good doctor's barn lately?

33:44.457 --> 33:45.947
Hey, Chloe, have you seen Pete?

33:46.125 --> 33:48.650
No, but the weird-o-meter
just kicked up another notch.

33:48.828 --> 33:50.318
Hospital visitor log.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.123
Yeah, I was looking into
Ray Wallace's death.

33:53.365 --> 33:57.358
It turns out he had a visitor just before
he flatlined. A Dr. Steven Hamilton.

33:57.536 --> 33:58.969
- The meteor freak?
- Yeah.

33:59.205 --> 34:00.729
- I thought he left.
- So did I.

34:00.906 --> 34:04.069
So Pete plays good samaritan,
Dr. Hamilton visits the patient...

34:04.243 --> 34:06.006
Patient dies and Pete disappears.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.146
It's not exactly smoking gun, but...

34:08.313 --> 34:10.440
It's good enough.
I'm gonna check out Hamilton.

34:10.616 --> 34:15.382
He used to have a place down on
Allentown Road, maybe he's back there.

34:16.322 --> 34:18.016
Clark?

34:18.190 --> 34:20.215
Clark?

34:21.260 --> 34:22.989
Clark?

34:31.637 --> 34:35.004
- What are you doing?
- See how my hand spasms?

34:35.174 --> 34:37.699
It's from prolonged exposure
to the meteor rocks.

34:38.010 --> 34:39.500
I'm gonna give you...

34:39.678 --> 34:43.341
...a dosage that's gonna make my tremors
look like a mild twitch.

34:43.516 --> 34:45.177
I told you I didn't know anything!

34:45.751 --> 34:48.150
I think you're lying.
You're protecting someone.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.312
- I hope whoever it is, is worth dying for!
- All right!

34:52.358 --> 34:55.156
You want me to talk,
here's what I have to say.

34:57.463 --> 35:01.490
Take that needle and stick it wherever,
because I'm not telling you a damn thing!

35:20.853 --> 35:22.514
Pete!

35:22.755 --> 35:25.918
- Put the needle down!
- Not till he tells me what he knows.

35:48.547 --> 35:50.139
Clark.

35:51.750 --> 35:54.310
- What's wrong?
- I'm allergic to the meteor rocks.

36:00.359 --> 36:02.384
This ship is yours, isn't it?

36:02.561 --> 36:05.155
Open it!
Open it!

36:05.865 --> 36:07.196
Open it!

36:21.547 --> 36:22.878
Clark, come on!

36:33.392 --> 36:35.019
We gotta get you out of here.

36:36.095 --> 36:37.926
We have to help him!

36:51.877 --> 36:54.539
It's too late, he's dead. Come on.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.274
We gotta get the ship.

37:10.663 --> 37:11.925
So does it do anything?

37:12.097 --> 37:14.691
We hoped we might
find some answers inside about Clark...

37:14.867 --> 37:16.664
...but we haven't been able to open it.

37:18.837 --> 37:20.702
Clark, look.

37:23.309 --> 37:26.073
I know I sort of went postal
when all this started...

37:26.946 --> 37:29.312
...but after what happened to Hamilton...

37:29.481 --> 37:31.506
...I realized why you never told me...

37:32.284 --> 37:34.115
...and I'm sorry.

37:37.323 --> 37:40.417
Well, I guess you had a good reason
to be upset.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.526
We're just glad you weren't hurt.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.056
There's still one thing.

37:45.431 --> 37:47.262
Hamilton tried to kill me, and...

37:47.566 --> 37:49.864
...he could have told the whole world
about you...

37:50.035 --> 37:51.969
...but you still tried to save him.

37:52.404 --> 37:56.363
I couldn't let you die to protect my secret,
and I can't let anyone else die either.

37:56.542 --> 37:58.237
No matter who they are.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.011
Man...

38:03.082 --> 38:05.107
...it's not easy being you, is it?

38:05.851 --> 38:09.116
Well, good thing is, I got my best friend
to watch my back.

38:09.455 --> 38:10.945
Pete...

38:11.957 --> 38:13.822
...I'm proud of you.

38:15.361 --> 38:19.695
But I hope you realize what a tremendous
responsibility knowing this secret is.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.568
And believe me,
it's not gonna get any easier.

38:25.371 --> 38:28.534
That's my dad's way of saying,
"Welcome to the family."

38:46.692 --> 38:50.025
Does it look anything like
Hamilton's description?

38:50.329 --> 38:51.626
What he says it was?

38:59.405 --> 39:01.464
There's nothing here, Dad.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.333
They must have moved it.

39:05.144 --> 39:06.441
Or someone took it.

39:06.612 --> 39:10.446
- Come on. The helicopter's waiting.
- No, I'm not going back, not just yet.

39:10.616 --> 39:13.915
- What about your treatment?
- I'm afraid those physical therapists...

39:14.086 --> 39:15.849
...will just have to come to me.

39:16.021 --> 39:19.718
I hope you're not staying because of
a sudden interest in alien spacecraft.

39:19.892 --> 39:21.154
Of course not.

39:21.326 --> 39:25.990
I'm staying because I want to spend
more quality time with my only son.

39:26.331 --> 39:29.061
Good, because this could all be a hoax.

39:29.234 --> 39:33.170
Hoax or not, I'm not the only one
who's suddenly interested in it.

39:36.909 --> 39:40.640
So this super-speed thing, how fast
we talking? Twenty, 30 miles per hour?

39:40.813 --> 39:42.678
Yeah, something like that.

39:46.018 --> 39:49.146
What about the x-ray? Have you
used it to look through a girl's...?

39:49.321 --> 39:52.779
It only works when I focus, and I do not
use it to invade people's privacy.

39:53.058 --> 39:55.026
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

39:55.994 --> 39:59.452
So you're telling me, never once
have you looked in the girls' locker room?

39:59.832 --> 40:01.322
Well...

40:01.800 --> 40:03.893
...maybe once.
- That's my boy.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.800
So you been holding back
on the court?

40:07.973 --> 40:09.235
A little bit.

40:11.176 --> 40:13.440
So, what are we waiting for?
Show me what you got.

40:13.612 --> 40:17.013
- I don't think you want to go there, Pete.
- Bring it on.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.951
- All right.
- Now, we all know...

40:21.120 --> 40:24.021
...if I guard you,
you're not getting near this hoop.

40:24.690 --> 40:27.250
I don't care what kind
of powers you got, let's go.

40:45.511 --> 40:47.741
This is gonna be fun.
