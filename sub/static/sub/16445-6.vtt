- <i>Previously on</i> Gotham...
- I hope you know, Oswald,

00:04.693 --> 00:06.693
you can always count on me.

00:10.165 --> 00:12.165
Thank you.

00:13.068 --> 00:14.234
Miss Kringle.

00:15.006 --> 00:16.803
Dinner. Chez Moi.

00:17.961 --> 00:19.239
Okay.

00:21.554 --> 00:23.053
That's for Kristen.

00:23.089 --> 00:24.989
VALERIE: <i>Whatever happened with Tetch?</i>

00:25.024 --> 00:27.324
Broke his sister <i>out of GCPD.</i>

00:27.360 --> 00:28.325
I'll never go with you!

00:28.361 --> 00:29.326
- I love you.
- You're insane!

00:29.362 --> 00:31.161
- No, no!
- (screams)

00:31.197 --> 00:34.098
No!

00:34.133 --> 00:35.332
You killed her!

00:35.368 --> 00:36.634
GORDON: <i>She died, he escaped.</i>

00:36.669 --> 00:37.801
'Cause I heard a rumor there's

00:37.837 --> 00:39.958
<i>something strange about her blood.</i>

00:48.180 --> 00:49.713
I'll tell you what you want to know.

00:50.532 --> 00:53.250
You are gonna have to
buy me dinner, though.

00:53.286 --> 00:54.551
He killed you.

00:54.587 --> 00:56.654
(gags)

00:56.689 --> 00:59.657
Those who hurt you

00:59.692 --> 01:02.559
will feel my pain.

01:03.596 --> 01:06.163
- ("Wedding March" plays)
- (cheering)

01:11.771 --> 01:12.937
I love you, Daddy.

01:12.972 --> 01:14.305
I love you, too, baby.

01:14.340 --> 01:16.507
- I'm so proud of you.
- (chuckles)

01:20.024 --> 01:21.060
Bye.

01:31.746 --> 01:32.979
(both laughing)

01:33.014 --> 01:34.680
Well, the good part is about to happen.

01:34.716 --> 01:35.948
I hope so.

01:35.984 --> 01:37.383
Look at that.

01:37.418 --> 01:39.752
There's no greater symbol of love

01:39.787 --> 01:43.055
than two people who've made the choice

01:43.091 --> 01:44.713
to spend the rest of
their lives together.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.493
Hey, pal, we have a reception to get to.

01:47.529 --> 01:50.229
- So, what you say we get a move on?
- Oh, yes,

01:50.265 --> 01:53.410
about that... I'm afraid
you won't be able to attend.

01:54.335 --> 01:56.068
This some kind of a joke?

01:57.238 --> 01:58.486
No.

01:59.607 --> 02:01.574
It's quite serious, in fact.

02:01.609 --> 02:02.909
(bride chuckles haltingly)

02:02.944 --> 02:04.443
You're needed elsewhere.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.409
Let's get out of here.

02:08.316 --> 02:09.982
- Hey, open the damn door.
- Sorry,

02:10.018 --> 02:11.450
we mustn't be late.

02:11.486 --> 02:13.152
Please just... don't hurt us.

02:13.188 --> 02:15.788
That's not my decision to make.

02:15.823 --> 02:18.224
Your fate depends entirely

02:18.259 --> 02:20.259
on James Gordon.

02:20.295 --> 02:21.260
Hey. Hey!

02:21.296 --> 02:23.262
Don't forget to buckle up.

02:23.298 --> 02:25.298
(couple clamoring)

02:27.502 --> 02:32.924
- Sync and corrections by madhatters -

02:33.965 --> 02:36.709
What a beautiful morning.

02:37.527 --> 02:39.946
Sun is shining, birds are singing.

02:39.981 --> 02:42.281
(sighs)

02:42.317 --> 02:45.084
They say that fortune favors the brave.

02:46.854 --> 02:48.988
They have that saying
in your country, Olga?

02:49.023 --> 02:50.690
<i>Ya ne ponimayu.</i>

02:50.725 --> 02:52.959
I don't know what you're saying.

02:52.994 --> 02:54.760
<i>Vash zavtrak gotov.</i>

02:55.477 --> 02:56.596
It's not important.

02:56.631 --> 02:58.631
What is important

02:58.666 --> 03:00.666
is that I have found someone.

03:02.470 --> 03:04.829
What good is love if it's one-sided?

03:06.674 --> 03:08.140
I have no choice

03:08.176 --> 03:10.243
but to confess my feelings to Ed.

03:10.278 --> 03:11.278
<i>Da.</i>

03:12.205 --> 03:14.146
Now that, I understand.

03:14.182 --> 03:15.848
It means yes.

03:15.883 --> 03:16.983
My mother taught me that.

03:17.018 --> 03:18.851
She used to tell me,

03:18.886 --> 03:22.455
"Life only gives you
one true love, Oswald.

03:23.458 --> 03:26.058
When you find it, run to it."

03:28.396 --> 03:30.162
So that is what I'm going to do.

03:30.198 --> 03:33.733
I'm also going to enroll
you in an ESL program.

03:33.768 --> 03:35.001
You really should learn the language

03:35.036 --> 03:36.068
if you're gonna work here.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.443
So, I hear that Lee
Thompkins is running point

03:44.479 --> 03:47.546
on Alice Tetch's blood at the GCPD.

03:47.582 --> 03:49.548
That would make sense.

03:49.584 --> 03:51.350
Can you get me a sit-down with her?

03:51.386 --> 03:53.052
(short chuckle)

03:53.087 --> 03:55.554
Oh, I see. You're willing to help me,

03:55.590 --> 03:56.889
just not when it comes to your ex.

03:56.924 --> 03:58.257
It's complicated.

03:58.293 --> 04:00.159
Actually, it's really simple.

04:00.194 --> 04:01.627
You just pick up the
phone, you dial her number

04:01.663 --> 04:03.195
and you let her know that
Valerie Vale would like

04:03.231 --> 04:05.998
a sit-down to discuss
Alice Tetch's blood.

04:06.034 --> 04:08.167
See? It's pretty simple.

04:10.305 --> 04:12.038
She won't give you anything.

04:12.073 --> 04:13.272
You leave that part to me.

04:15.124 --> 04:16.725
You know, I can get used to this...

04:16.817 --> 04:18.778
You helping me with my stories.

04:18.813 --> 04:20.478
We make a pretty good team.

04:20.515 --> 04:22.682
Hmm. Does that mean you'll
share your breakfast?

04:22.717 --> 04:24.473
Absolutely not.

04:24.507 --> 04:26.686
But really, when are you
gonna give up this P.I. act?

04:26.721 --> 04:29.789
So far you've had two
cases... One girl died,

04:29.824 --> 04:32.391
and the other one, well,
you never found her.

04:32.427 --> 04:34.026
In baseball we call that an O-fer.

04:35.036 --> 04:36.913
- I'm happy.
- Of course you are.

04:36.959 --> 04:39.298
You get to drink scotch all
day and have sex with me.

04:39.334 --> 04:40.766
Uh...

04:40.802 --> 04:42.611
I got to go to work.

04:43.604 --> 04:45.304
You know what?

04:45.340 --> 04:47.139
This is nice.

04:48.643 --> 04:50.676
Let me know when you
hear from Thompkins.

04:53.381 --> 04:55.381
Uh-huh.

05:03.458 --> 05:05.257
Can I help you?

05:05.293 --> 05:06.525
James Gordon,

05:06.561 --> 05:08.561
Jervis Tetch has a message for you.

05:10.836 --> 05:12.531
Follow my friend where to go,

05:12.567 --> 05:15.134
to learn the truth you've hidden below.

05:15.157 --> 05:17.236
Should you choose not to play,

05:17.271 --> 05:19.400
precious people will die today.

05:24.278 --> 05:26.278
(train whistle blows)

05:32.854 --> 05:34.854
(phone ringing)

05:44.265 --> 05:46.766
- This is Gordon.
- Hello, James.

05:46.801 --> 05:48.534
Jervis.

05:48.569 --> 05:50.573
Never should have left that
hole you were hiding in.

05:50.619 --> 05:53.105
Oh, I wasn't just hiding.

05:53.141 --> 05:55.174
I put the time to good use.

05:55.771 --> 05:57.659
Made a thorough study of you.

05:57.705 --> 06:01.113
Quite the fascinating
history, yet so tragic.

06:01.149 --> 06:02.948
A father lost,

06:02.984 --> 06:04.750
career gone by the wayside,

06:04.786 --> 06:06.419
failed relationships.

06:06.454 --> 06:08.592
And here I didn't think about your once.

06:08.626 --> 06:09.555
(chuckles)

06:09.590 --> 06:11.018
Oh, James.

06:11.859 --> 06:13.692
I've been inside that
head of yours, James.

06:13.728 --> 06:15.428
I've seen

06:15.463 --> 06:18.197
the web of lies you tell yourself.

06:18.232 --> 06:20.766
Strung together to keep that

06:20.802 --> 06:22.677
fragile psyche of yours intact.

06:22.735 --> 06:24.437
Well, it's been nice
catching up with you.

06:24.472 --> 06:27.973
I'm going to force you to
confront who you really are.

06:28.009 --> 06:30.443
And I'm going to drive you mad

06:30.478 --> 06:32.578
doing it. Now, please,

06:32.613 --> 06:34.239
direct your eyes to the overpass.

06:34.273 --> 06:37.316
Meet Dave and Amy Walters.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.352
Married just this morning.

06:40.388 --> 06:41.720
Lovely ceremony.

06:41.756 --> 06:44.056
In 30 seconds they're going
to jump to their deaths.

06:44.091 --> 06:46.892
Take the stairs and you
can save them. However,

06:46.928 --> 06:48.461
down the street there's a little boy.

06:48.496 --> 06:50.830
His name is Shane, and he's going to be

06:50.865 --> 06:54.695
hit by a truck, driven by my
highly esteemed associate.

06:54.741 --> 06:56.202
(tires screeching)

07:00.041 --> 07:01.789
Choice is yours James.

07:03.769 --> 07:06.178
You can't save both.

07:07.998 --> 07:10.325
So, who's it going to be?

07:35.409 --> 07:37.409
(bodies thud)

07:46.160 --> 07:48.327
JERVIS: <i>You can't save both.</i>

07:48.363 --> 07:50.329
(echoing): <i>You can't save both.</i>

07:50.365 --> 07:52.998
(phone ringing)

08:01.109 --> 08:02.308
You son of a bitch.

08:02.343 --> 08:04.340
Good, now I have your attention.

08:04.386 --> 08:06.445
They were innocent, Jervis.
You didn't have to kill them.

08:06.481 --> 08:08.080
It was your choice, James.

08:08.116 --> 08:11.083
You practically pushed
them off the ledge.

08:11.119 --> 08:14.487
- Stay with me, James. James?
- What?

08:14.522 --> 08:17.790
87 Fulton Street,
apartment 4C. Five minutes.

08:17.825 --> 08:20.793
No police or more people die.

08:20.828 --> 08:22.828
(sirens wailing in distance)

08:28.473 --> 08:31.270
Oh, boy, now it's official.

08:31.305 --> 08:32.671
Why, you looking to back out?

08:32.707 --> 08:34.623
You'd have to put a bullet in me.

08:34.692 --> 08:36.041
Good thing I don't carry a gun.

08:36.077 --> 08:37.275
(chuckles)

08:39.414 --> 08:41.280
My father called. (clears throat)

08:41.315 --> 08:43.015
He wants to throw us
an engagement party.

08:43.049 --> 08:45.184
- Told him we're not interested.
- Okay.

08:45.219 --> 08:47.386
I know you had reservations
about moving back here.

08:47.422 --> 08:49.288
And you know my dad... Half
measures aren't his thing.

08:49.323 --> 08:50.589
If we say yes,

08:50.625 --> 08:52.658
he's gonna put us on
display for the whole city.

08:52.693 --> 08:53.928
I understand.

08:55.551 --> 08:57.062
But we chose to build a life here.

08:57.625 --> 08:58.684
And I'm glad.

08:59.801 --> 09:01.784
An engagement party sounds wonderful.

09:05.706 --> 09:08.207
These go directly to
the city clerk's office.

09:10.511 --> 09:13.078
And this...

09:15.616 --> 09:17.049
Leave this outside

09:17.084 --> 09:19.185
Nicky the Nail's place. Knock twice.

09:19.220 --> 09:21.053
- Light it and then run.
- (door opens)

09:21.088 --> 09:23.088
- Okay.
- (door closes)

09:26.899 --> 09:28.360
Good morning, Mayor Cobblepot.

09:28.396 --> 09:30.629
Good morning to you, my chief of staff.

09:30.665 --> 09:32.431
Here are your schedules for the
day. This covers your duties

09:32.467 --> 09:35.134
as mayor, and this as
kingpin of the underworld.

09:36.337 --> 09:38.800
You really are settling into
your role here, aren't you, Ed?

09:38.823 --> 09:41.373
And yet I still have so
much to learn from you.

09:41.409 --> 09:43.609
Oh...

09:43.644 --> 09:44.844
(clears throat)

09:47.315 --> 09:49.448
I came up empty tracking down Butch.

09:49.484 --> 09:51.383
Somehow

09:51.419 --> 09:53.452
that one-handed ape
managed to disappear.

09:53.488 --> 09:56.027
I suspect he's hiding with his old crew.

09:58.159 --> 09:59.708
I'm sorry for letting you down.

10:00.561 --> 10:03.195
You have done nothing of the sort.

10:03.231 --> 10:06.434
I would be lost without you.

10:08.536 --> 10:10.069
In fact, um...

10:10.104 --> 10:12.671
there is something that
I need to tell you.

10:13.345 --> 10:15.274
Something very important.

10:22.517 --> 10:24.517
What is it, Oswald?

10:28.923 --> 10:31.657
You know what? I forget.

10:31.692 --> 10:34.460
(laughs) In and out of
my head, just like that.

10:34.495 --> 10:36.028
Don't you hate that when that happens?

10:36.063 --> 10:37.129
That never happens to me.

10:37.164 --> 10:39.098
You know what? I believe that. (laughs)

10:39.133 --> 10:41.471
So, uh, where are we off to first?

10:41.517 --> 10:44.336
PS 134. You're touring a school.

10:44.372 --> 10:46.302
Press will be there, so
we better get a move on.

10:47.878 --> 10:50.543
Great. I love children.

10:50.578 --> 10:52.578
(clears his throat)

10:53.955 --> 10:56.181
Okay, thank you very much. Okay?

10:56.217 --> 10:58.984
(sirens blaring)

11:00.017 --> 11:02.488
Hey, Cap, I just spoke
to that kid over there.

11:02.523 --> 11:04.023
You're not gonna believe this.

11:04.058 --> 11:05.858
He said Jim Gordon saved his life.

11:05.893 --> 11:08.027
Pulled him out of the way of a truck.

11:08.062 --> 11:09.461
Get him on the phone now.

11:09.497 --> 11:11.330
I already tried him. No answer.

11:11.365 --> 11:14.333
(siren chirps)

11:14.368 --> 11:17.036
What happened, you forget your cane?

11:17.071 --> 11:19.238
I don't need it anymore.

11:19.273 --> 11:21.340
Put an all-points out on Gordon.

11:21.375 --> 11:22.962
I want him found.

11:24.378 --> 11:26.845
Hey, does that guy look strange to you?

11:26.881 --> 11:29.281
I mean, more so than
the usual whack job?

11:29.317 --> 11:31.450
Hey, pal!

11:31.485 --> 11:33.385
You see what happened here?

11:33.421 --> 11:34.796
I have a message for you.

11:34.842 --> 11:37.323
James Gordon, I have a message for you.

11:38.459 --> 11:40.626
James Gordon, I have a message for you.

11:40.661 --> 11:42.361
- He's hypnotized.
- James Gordon,

11:42.396 --> 11:45.364
- I have a message for you.
- Tetch.

11:49.036 --> 11:51.036
(siren blaring in the distance)

12:22.336 --> 12:25.337
(phone ringing)

12:37.318 --> 12:39.084
Jervis?

12:39.120 --> 12:40.986
JERVIS: Cutting it close, James.

12:41.022 --> 12:42.721
Like what you've done with the place.

12:42.757 --> 12:44.402
Everyone needs a hobby.

12:45.092 --> 12:47.059
Take a peek through the lens.

12:47.094 --> 12:49.094
Let's chat face-to-face.

12:52.683 --> 12:56.335
I wonder, what is it that you
have against married couples?

12:56.370 --> 12:58.737
Bad memories, perhaps.

12:58.773 --> 13:00.973
Understandable, given the last time

13:01.008 --> 13:03.075
you saw a woman in a wedding dress,

13:03.110 --> 13:05.482
she had a shotgun pointed at you.

13:05.781 --> 13:08.224
- Hey, Jervis.
- Yes, James?

13:10.985 --> 13:12.985
(phone ringing)

13:16.691 --> 13:19.224
- Hello?
- Don't you ever do that again!

13:19.260 --> 13:20.926
Okay.

13:20.961 --> 13:23.562
(phone ringing)

13:23.597 --> 13:25.397
This is about your sister, isn't it?

13:25.433 --> 13:28.067
In your addled brain, you blame
me for what happened to her.

13:28.102 --> 13:29.468
Don't you talk about her!

13:29.503 --> 13:31.870
I got to know her, Jervis.
She was a good person.

13:31.906 --> 13:33.505
That's why she hated you.

13:33.541 --> 13:36.041
Why she died trying
to get away from you.

13:36.077 --> 13:38.810
You want revenge, kill yourself.

13:38.844 --> 13:41.470
Dismissive, rude. I
don't like your attitude.

13:41.516 --> 13:42.576
Well, tell you what.

13:42.610 --> 13:44.950
I'll come down, and we can
talk about it in person.

13:44.985 --> 13:46.712
Hang up again, she dies.

13:48.183 --> 13:51.490
- What are you talking about? Who?
- Surprising, really,

13:51.525 --> 13:53.892
given that every
relationship you've been in

13:53.928 --> 13:56.061
ended in such misery.

13:56.097 --> 13:59.832
And yet, you made the
choice to date again.

13:59.867 --> 14:01.800
Poor girl. She had

14:01.836 --> 14:04.937
no idea who she was
getting into bed with.

14:04.972 --> 14:06.672
She will soon.

14:06.707 --> 14:07.937
See for yourself.

14:10.478 --> 14:12.391
Great thing about reporters.

14:13.856 --> 14:15.814
Tell them you have a story,

14:15.850 --> 14:17.783
and they'll meet you anywhere.

14:20.221 --> 14:22.688
(muffled shouting)

14:24.792 --> 14:27.359
(tires squealing, engine revving)

14:36.197 --> 14:37.897
Got him in a safe house uptown.

14:37.932 --> 14:40.500
You would not believe the
amount of steak that man eats.

14:40.535 --> 14:43.818
Poor, Butchie. Nothing but
Tabitha and red meat all day.

14:43.864 --> 14:45.397
You know, sooner or later,

14:45.455 --> 14:47.533
Penguin is gonna figure
out who sprung him.

14:47.590 --> 14:48.823
You need a plan, sweetie.

14:48.858 --> 14:51.098
- I'm working on it.
- And in the meantime,

14:51.213 --> 14:53.194
has the flame rekindled between you two,

14:53.229 --> 14:54.762
or are you still holding out?

14:54.797 --> 14:56.230
- We'll see.
- (door opens)

14:56.265 --> 14:57.998
Oh, speaking of old flames.

14:58.034 --> 14:59.567
BARBARA: Oh.

14:59.602 --> 15:01.569
Well, you just can't seem to stay away.

15:01.604 --> 15:03.704
- Tetch... where is he?
- How should I know?

15:03.739 --> 15:06.974
And if you don't mind, Tabitha
and I are just in the mid...

15:07.009 --> 15:09.343
- (glass breaking)
- Unnecessary.

15:09.378 --> 15:10.911
Jervis Tetch kidnapped
Valerie Vale this morning.

15:10.947 --> 15:12.513
He knew things that only
you could have told him.

15:12.548 --> 15:14.515
I want to know where he is.

15:14.550 --> 15:15.783
Oh. See that fire?

15:15.818 --> 15:17.852
I mean, where was that
when we were together?

15:17.887 --> 15:19.954
All I got was Captain Vanilla.

15:20.990 --> 15:22.690
(sighs)

15:22.725 --> 15:25.793
Seriously, we have to
open in a few hours.

15:25.828 --> 15:27.995
- Then talk.
- Firstly,

15:28.030 --> 15:29.563
I don't know where Tetch is.

15:29.599 --> 15:31.198
Secondly, he may have come in here

15:31.234 --> 15:32.833
a few days ago asking about you.

15:32.869 --> 15:35.136
- Asking what?
- Oh, you know,

15:35.171 --> 15:36.603
everything.

15:36.660 --> 15:40.040
Family stuff, GCPD,
the women in your life.

15:40.076 --> 15:41.988
He seemed especially interested in that.

15:42.011 --> 15:44.145
He knew all about Vale
already, but I told him

15:44.180 --> 15:45.779
about us.

15:45.815 --> 15:47.748
About how you're still in love with me,

15:47.783 --> 15:48.983
cry yourself to sleep at night.

15:49.018 --> 15:51.018
And Lee?

15:51.053 --> 15:52.486
Did you tell him about her?

15:52.522 --> 15:53.954
Oh, you mean

15:53.990 --> 15:56.921
Miss Rebound from me? Of course.

15:57.226 --> 15:58.893
(phone beeps on)

15:58.928 --> 16:02.196
We'll send you a bill for the damage.

16:02.231 --> 16:03.531
Lee, listen to me.

16:03.566 --> 16:04.865
JERVIS: I'm sorry, James.

16:04.901 --> 16:06.333
Lee can't come to the phone right now.

16:06.369 --> 16:07.701
Can I take a message?

16:07.737 --> 16:09.103
No? Good.

16:09.138 --> 16:11.354
Gotham Water and Power, ten minutes.

16:11.388 --> 16:14.074
I need to know she's
okay, both Lee and Vale.

16:14.110 --> 16:15.876
What you want means nothing to me!

16:15.912 --> 16:17.912
- Nine minutes.
- (click, phone beeps off)

16:20.883 --> 16:23.350
James sends his regards.

16:23.386 --> 16:25.519
Now, where were we?

16:25.555 --> 16:28.522
Oh, yes, introductions.

16:28.558 --> 16:31.692
Lee Thompkins, meet Valerie Vale.

16:31.727 --> 16:35.392
You both have one very
important thing in common.

16:36.399 --> 16:39.333
You're two halves of Jim Gordon's heart.

16:46.742 --> 16:49.610
James Gordon, I have a message for you.

16:49.645 --> 16:51.845
Where is Jervis Tetch?

16:51.881 --> 16:53.247
James Gordon,

16:53.282 --> 16:55.731
- I have a message for you.
- Yeah, I know.

16:55.754 --> 16:58.034
You said that the first
hundred times I asked you.

16:58.092 --> 17:00.554
James Gordon, I have a message for you.

17:00.590 --> 17:03.591
Where is he?! I know you can hear me!

17:03.626 --> 17:05.626
(metallic creaking)

17:07.096 --> 17:09.230
(groaning)

17:12.001 --> 17:14.134
Hey, Cap, a uni just spotted Gordon

17:14.170 --> 17:15.970
pulling up to Gotham Water and Power.

17:16.005 --> 17:18.714
Tell him to hold his
position till we get there.

17:36.259 --> 17:38.259
(steam hissing)

17:40.029 --> 17:42.129
(hissing, crackling and buzzing)

17:43.566 --> 17:46.567
(hissing)

17:46.602 --> 17:49.837
(electrical buzzing)

17:49.872 --> 17:51.905
(electrical squeal)

17:51.941 --> 17:54.622
Glad you could make it, James.

17:56.648 --> 17:58.245
Where's Lee and Vale?

17:58.281 --> 18:00.781
Oh, you clearly have no
sense for stagecraft.

18:00.816 --> 18:03.183
We must build to the climax.

18:03.219 --> 18:05.853
This is merely the second act,

18:05.888 --> 18:07.655
where we stoke the tension.

18:09.759 --> 18:13.794
On the right is one of
Gotham's finest pediatricians.

18:13.829 --> 18:15.029
(groaning)

18:15.064 --> 18:17.264
On the left, Channel
Five's favorite anchor.

18:17.300 --> 18:18.799
(groaning)

18:18.834 --> 18:21.101
A doctor and a journalist.

18:21.137 --> 18:23.203
- You get it?
- Yeah, I get it.

18:23.239 --> 18:24.872
The choice is simple, you see. It's kill

18:24.907 --> 18:26.869
one, and the other will go free.

18:26.926 --> 18:29.209
But if your answer to me is "no,"

18:29.245 --> 18:31.979
a thousand watts into them will go.

18:32.014 --> 18:35.482
(men groaning, electrical buzzing)

18:37.353 --> 18:39.853
(men groaning, electrical buzzing)

18:48.352 --> 18:50.464
Sorry, Jervis. I'm not killing anyone.

18:50.499 --> 18:51.799
Yes, you will!

18:51.834 --> 18:54.041
Now pick up the pistol and fire!

18:54.087 --> 18:57.037
You want to show me who I
really am, then show me.

18:57.073 --> 18:58.539
Oh, I will.

18:58.574 --> 18:59.907
I'm done playing your game.

18:59.942 --> 19:00.974
BULLOCK: Jim!

19:04.213 --> 19:05.913
Hold.

19:05.948 --> 19:07.314
What the hell's going on here?

19:07.350 --> 19:08.582
Captain Barnes, you're just

19:08.617 --> 19:12.653
in time to see James kill
these two innocent men.

19:12.688 --> 19:14.221
You need to find the
main power shutoff now.

19:14.256 --> 19:16.357
- Go.
- JERVIS: Even when

19:16.392 --> 19:19.259
you don't choose, James,
there are consequences.

19:20.596 --> 19:23.831
(electrical buzzing and
hissing, men yelling)

19:23.866 --> 19:26.567
GORDON: No!

19:30.539 --> 19:32.206
(power whooshes off)

19:32.241 --> 19:34.708
No. No!

19:37.196 --> 19:39.246
- I'm gonna find you.
- Oh, I'm counting on it.

19:39.281 --> 19:42.252
Just ask an old friend
how to get to the end.

19:49.483 --> 19:52.183
- (school bell ringing)
- This is our third grade class.

19:53.042 --> 19:56.109
How many more grades
do we have to visit?

19:56.145 --> 19:58.011
This is a K through 12 building.

19:58.047 --> 19:59.880
- Twelve?
- Mm-hmm.

19:59.915 --> 20:01.982
We don't have to see
every single class, do we?

20:02.017 --> 20:03.863
Mayor James used to
read to the children.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.663
Aubrey James is illiterate, ma'am.

20:05.709 --> 20:08.012
- It's well documented.
- Perhaps we should move on.

20:10.745 --> 20:12.338
What's wrong with that boy there?

20:14.108 --> 20:16.209
That's Luke.

20:16.244 --> 20:18.760
He's new here.

20:28.623 --> 20:30.590
Hello, Luke.

20:30.625 --> 20:32.658
I am Mayor Cobblepot.

20:32.694 --> 20:34.760
Why aren't you playing
with the other children?

20:34.796 --> 20:37.597
What if they don't like me?

20:37.632 --> 20:40.900
Well, how would you ever know
if you don't give it a try?

20:43.972 --> 20:45.438
And if they don't like you,

20:45.473 --> 20:47.273
wait for them to turn their backs

20:47.308 --> 20:48.908
and push them down the stairs.

20:53.047 --> 20:55.014
(chuckles)

20:55.049 --> 20:57.083
(indistinct chatter)

20:57.118 --> 20:59.352
Little guy needed a push. That's all.

21:00.388 --> 21:02.788
I continue to be in awe of you, Oswald.

21:07.629 --> 21:08.928
Ed.

21:10.220 --> 21:13.366
There is something I
would like to discuss

21:13.401 --> 21:15.448
in a more private setting.

21:16.137 --> 21:18.871
Shall we say dinner
at the mansion, 8:00?

21:18.907 --> 21:20.973
I'll pick us up a nice bottle of wine.

21:21.009 --> 21:23.776
(chuckles)

21:23.811 --> 21:25.444
BARNES: <i>Tetch has</i>

21:25.480 --> 21:26.879
Lee Thompkins and Valerie Vale.

21:26.915 --> 21:28.814
- You're sure?
- Saw him take Vale.

21:28.850 --> 21:31.651
And I called Lee's cell
and he answered. So, yeah,

21:31.686 --> 21:33.185
pretty sure. Call the M.E.'s office,

21:33.221 --> 21:34.857
call her fiancé... Find her.

21:37.479 --> 21:39.494
What the hell is going on here?

21:40.929 --> 21:43.696
Tetch blames me for what
happened to his sister.

21:43.731 --> 21:45.831
- He wants revenge.
- So, what,

21:45.867 --> 21:47.133
he kills two innocent civilians.

21:47.168 --> 21:48.634
- How does that track?
- He's obsessed

21:48.670 --> 21:50.636
with showing me who I really am,

21:50.672 --> 21:52.638
driving me insane.

21:52.674 --> 21:56.075
He killed them, and I just stood there.

21:56.110 --> 21:57.743
What were you supposed to do,

21:57.779 --> 21:59.812
shoot one of 'em? You
did what you could.

21:59.847 --> 22:00.813
That's on him.

22:00.848 --> 22:02.671
This is just to prepare me.

22:07.347 --> 22:08.955
He's gonna make me choose.

22:08.990 --> 22:12.291
He's gonna put me in
front of Lee and Vale,

22:12.327 --> 22:14.126
and he's gonna make me choose.

22:14.162 --> 22:17.029
- And if I don't...
- He'll kill both of them.

22:20.401 --> 22:22.134
We're gonna find her.

22:22.170 --> 22:24.056
I promise you that.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.507
Listen to me, Tetch is a lunatic.

22:28.543 --> 22:30.176
He's gonna get caught.

22:30.211 --> 22:32.011
The most you can hope for
is a lifetime in prison.

22:32.046 --> 22:33.879
- Don't do this.
- Dumfree,

22:33.915 --> 22:36.849
let's see what's in the kitchen.

22:36.884 --> 22:38.884
Mm-hmm.

22:40.922 --> 22:43.356
(hinges creaking)

22:43.391 --> 22:45.291
Nice try.

22:45.326 --> 22:47.112
So why'd they bring
us back to your place?

22:47.146 --> 22:48.160
Like I know.

22:48.196 --> 22:49.829
Well, any chance your
boyfriend might come home?

22:49.864 --> 22:51.130
Not likely.

22:51.165 --> 22:52.669
(sighs)

22:54.002 --> 22:55.517
You do know what this
is about, don't you?

22:55.563 --> 22:59.372
Yes. Tetch blames Jim for his sister,
and we're his means for revenge.

22:59.407 --> 23:01.240
- I've been here before.
- That's too big.

23:01.275 --> 23:02.970
It's never gonna spring the mechanism.

23:05.079 --> 23:07.046
You know, it is kind of ironic though.

23:07.081 --> 23:10.149
I was just asking Jim to get
me a sit-down with you, and...

23:10.184 --> 23:12.051
- here we are.
- Uh-huh.

23:12.964 --> 23:15.850
See, I'm running a story
on Alice Tetch's blood.

23:15.954 --> 23:18.177
I know you're running
point for the GCPD.

23:20.139 --> 23:22.361
You're not seriously trying to
interview me right now, are you?

23:22.396 --> 23:23.963
Jim said you wouldn't talk to me.

23:23.998 --> 23:25.165
And he was right.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.360
I think he was just
being protective of you.

23:30.271 --> 23:32.171
Anyway, about Alice Tetch,

23:32.206 --> 23:33.906
I hear they're running
experiments on her blood

23:33.941 --> 23:35.441
at the GCPD bio facility.

23:35.476 --> 23:38.010
- Care to comment?
- Maybe you're just really sacred

23:38.046 --> 23:39.412
and this is your way of coping,

23:39.447 --> 23:41.614
or maybe you're just insanely
committed to your job.

23:41.649 --> 23:44.517
Either way, all I'm interested
in is getting out of here.

23:45.481 --> 23:46.990
Try a cuticle pusher.

23:47.255 --> 23:49.789
My dad was a cop... Taught
me how to pick locks.

23:49.824 --> 23:51.357
I can walk you through it.

23:51.392 --> 23:53.092
Thank you.

23:53.127 --> 23:55.594
And in exchange, you can
talk to me about Alice Tetch.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.064
You and Jim are made for each other.

23:58.099 --> 23:59.665
Thanks.

23:59.701 --> 24:01.310
It's not a compliment.

24:01.803 --> 24:05.104
Thank you, Dr. Calvi. I'll call
you as soon as we hear anything.

24:05.139 --> 24:07.707
Mario's been in surgery all morning.

24:07.742 --> 24:11.177
Says that he and Lee left the
house together this morning.

24:11.212 --> 24:14.313
She was headed to the station.
He hasn't heard from her since.

24:14.348 --> 24:16.148
Jervis must have grabbed
her before she got here.

24:16.184 --> 24:17.950
What's his next move?

24:17.985 --> 24:19.452
Tetch wants me to find him.

24:19.487 --> 24:21.187
Well, if that's the case, then
why didn't he just tell you

24:21.222 --> 24:22.655
- where he is?
- I don't know.

24:22.690 --> 24:24.924
But the last thing he said was
something about an old friend

24:24.959 --> 24:26.258
leading me to him.

24:26.294 --> 24:28.461
Well, I'm not just
gonna sit here and wait

24:28.496 --> 24:31.230
for Tetch to send you an invitation.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.133
Listen up!

24:34.168 --> 24:38.804
Jervis Tetch thinks that Gotham
is his personal playground.

24:38.840 --> 24:41.006
He's taken innocent lives.

24:41.042 --> 24:43.961
And now he has Lee
Thompkins and Valerie Vale.

24:43.995 --> 24:46.448
And to whoever puts the collar on Tetch,

24:47.012 --> 24:50.783
my personal gratitude
and best bottle of brown.

24:50.818 --> 24:52.118
Now go to work.

24:52.153 --> 24:54.449
WHITE RABBIT: <i>Follow
my friend where to go.</i>

24:55.824 --> 24:58.924
James Gordon, I have a message for you.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.259
James Gordon,

25:00.294 --> 25:03.129
- I have a message for you.
- Hey.

25:03.164 --> 25:04.694
James Gordon.

25:08.605 --> 25:11.656
- I have a message for you.
- How do I get to the end?

25:34.008 --> 25:36.529
"The true test will be revealed.

25:36.564 --> 25:38.639
"A final decision you must yield.

25:39.667 --> 25:41.735
"Our tea party begins once more...

25:44.538 --> 25:47.337
when you walk through
Lee Thompkins' door."

25:56.617 --> 25:58.584
- Jim.
- Not now.

25:58.619 --> 26:01.387
What the hell is going on? Where's Lee?

26:06.060 --> 26:08.122
Look, you're just
gonna have to trust me.

26:08.180 --> 26:10.129
Trust you? According to Captain Barnes,

26:10.164 --> 26:11.931
you're the reason she's
in trouble to begin with.

26:11.966 --> 26:13.165
You know something.

26:13.201 --> 26:14.867
You know where she is, don't you?

26:14.902 --> 26:16.869
(snarls) Keep your voice down.

26:16.904 --> 26:18.003
Does Barnes know?

26:18.039 --> 26:20.105
- Where is he?
- No, he does not know.

26:20.141 --> 26:23.442
Because if he showed up with 20 cops,
both Lee and Vale would be dead.

26:23.477 --> 26:26.378
I see. So you're gonna go
in all alone and save 'em?

26:26.414 --> 26:27.880
Is that it?

26:27.915 --> 26:30.749
Actually, you might be the
only person who could help me.

26:30.785 --> 26:32.785
Come on.

26:34.701 --> 26:36.689
- Remember, you have to feel...
- I got it.

26:39.273 --> 26:40.626
Can I ask you something?

26:40.661 --> 26:43.195
As long as it's not about
Alice Tetch's blood.

26:45.661 --> 26:47.458
Why'd you move back to Gotham?

26:47.504 --> 26:48.734
The way I hear it,

26:48.769 --> 26:51.070
you made a pretty nice life
for yourself down south.

26:51.105 --> 26:52.771
It's really none of your business.

26:52.807 --> 26:54.440
Maybe not.

26:54.475 --> 26:56.976
But you could have moved to
any city, gotten any job,

26:57.011 --> 26:58.477
yet you chose Gotham

26:58.510 --> 26:59.501
and the GCPD.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.482
You realize that we both
might die today, right?

27:01.515 --> 27:02.715
Mm-hmm.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.411
Well?

27:06.621 --> 27:08.988
I didn't come here for James Gordon,

27:09.023 --> 27:11.790
if that's what you're worried about.

27:11.826 --> 27:13.592
- (click)
- Not bad.

27:13.628 --> 27:14.927
(exhales)

27:14.962 --> 27:16.595
- My turn.
- Okay.

27:16.631 --> 27:18.697
- Okay, so what's our plan?
- You're gonna break free,

27:18.733 --> 27:19.932
we're gonna lure in one of these goons,

27:19.967 --> 27:21.500
hit him over the head with something.

27:21.535 --> 27:23.435
Not good.

27:23.471 --> 27:25.437
Um, you can still get out of here.

27:25.473 --> 27:27.606
I'm not leaving you here.
There's got to be something else

27:27.642 --> 27:29.074
- we can use.
- JERVIS: My, my.

27:31.279 --> 27:32.478
You two have been busy.

27:32.513 --> 27:35.848
Now, if you'd kindly join
me in the dining room,

27:35.883 --> 27:39.151
the guest of honor will be here shortly.

27:51.165 --> 27:52.798
(hinges creaking)

27:52.833 --> 27:54.833
(operatic music playing)

28:06.380 --> 28:08.805
Welcome to our tea party, James.

28:08.863 --> 28:11.216
We've been expecting you.

28:19.482 --> 28:21.882
Please.

28:25.321 --> 28:27.321
Have a seat.

28:30.693 --> 28:33.828
- I think I'll stand.
- You'll do what I say

28:33.863 --> 28:35.329
or things will get messy.

28:35.365 --> 28:37.031
And by messy I mean

28:37.066 --> 28:38.833
my two friends will pull their triggers,

28:38.868 --> 28:41.035
and then we'll have blood and brains

28:41.070 --> 28:42.529
all over this beautiful table.

28:42.575 --> 28:43.807
So...

28:46.076 --> 28:49.991
place your gun on the
platter and have a seat.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.014
Really?

28:53.049 --> 28:54.415
After all we've been through today,

28:54.450 --> 28:56.417
you have to think about it?

28:56.452 --> 28:59.053
Not everyone here has to die.

29:17.106 --> 29:18.939
It's gonna be okay.

29:19.976 --> 29:22.043
Don't lie to them, James.

29:22.828 --> 29:24.211
Lee,

29:24.247 --> 29:27.415
would you mind passing
that down to James?

29:27.450 --> 29:29.583
I must apologize

29:29.619 --> 29:31.585
for the hideous china. (chuckles)

29:31.621 --> 29:35.199
Frankly, I expected more
from Don Falcone's son.

29:36.325 --> 29:38.424
I guess I know what I'm
getting you for your wedding.

29:39.328 --> 29:40.428
(sighs)

29:42.298 --> 29:44.265
To good health.

29:44.300 --> 29:45.633
I think I'll pass.

29:45.668 --> 29:46.700
Me, too.

29:48.004 --> 29:50.071
You know what,

29:50.106 --> 29:52.473
I'll have some.

29:54.665 --> 29:56.377
Bravo, James.

29:58.981 --> 30:00.915
Now,

30:00.950 --> 30:03.317
I'd like to begin by telling the story

30:03.352 --> 30:05.653
of a brother and a sister,

30:05.688 --> 30:09.423
separated for years but
whose love never waned.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.959
Fair warning though,

30:11.994 --> 30:14.728
it has a sad ending.

30:20.470 --> 30:22.403
(keys jangle)

30:33.816 --> 30:37.084
But I couldn't find my sister alone,

30:37.120 --> 30:40.287
so I turned to this man, James Gordon,

30:40.323 --> 30:42.156
whom everyone said was a good man,

30:42.191 --> 30:43.890
an honorable man.

30:43.959 --> 30:45.341
And what did this good man do?

30:45.410 --> 30:46.460
Why,

30:46.496 --> 30:49.130
he found my sister and
he turned her against me,

30:49.165 --> 30:52.666
poisoning her mind.
And then he killed her!

30:55.671 --> 30:57.605
Does that sound about right, James?

30:57.640 --> 30:59.907
- Sure, why not?
- Now, James,

30:59.942 --> 31:02.542
I get the sense you're not being honest.

31:02.565 --> 31:05.012
Though that's not
surprising, considering

31:05.047 --> 31:08.749
you've run from your true
self every day of your life.

31:08.784 --> 31:11.252
But you can't run from this choice.

31:11.287 --> 31:16.440
The woman you love is going to die.

31:17.627 --> 31:20.113
I just need to figure
out which one it is.

31:20.730 --> 31:25.799
So let's review our options, shall we?

31:36.973 --> 31:41.515
On the one hand, we have Lee Thompkins.

31:41.551 --> 31:44.084
Intelligent, kind.

31:44.120 --> 31:45.819
She thought she could save you

31:45.855 --> 31:48.638
from your darkness,
drag you into the light.

31:48.649 --> 31:50.691
And what did she get for her efforts?

31:50.726 --> 31:52.359
Hmm?

31:52.395 --> 31:54.828
Pain and sadness.

31:54.864 --> 31:56.369
GORDON: Don't listen to him, Lee.

32:01.604 --> 32:03.466
Look in her eyes.

32:06.475 --> 32:08.897
She still has love for you, James.

32:10.513 --> 32:11.845
And then,

32:11.881 --> 32:14.281
there's Valerie Vale.

32:14.317 --> 32:16.417
The intrepid reporter

32:16.452 --> 32:18.085
from a blue-collar family.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.582
She still has hope for you.

32:22.513 --> 32:25.761
What will happen when she
learns who you really are?

32:26.429 --> 32:28.195
So...

32:28.231 --> 32:31.929
those are the choices.

32:34.069 --> 32:35.970
Now it's up to you.

32:36.005 --> 32:39.206
Which lady...

32:39.242 --> 32:41.141
has your heart?

32:41.198 --> 32:42.977
Who do you love?

32:44.580 --> 32:46.013
You want me to choose?

32:46.048 --> 32:47.948
Tell these idiots to lower their guns.

32:47.984 --> 32:49.950
I don't trust them not
to shoot me by accident.

32:49.986 --> 32:52.786
You're right. They are stupid.

32:52.822 --> 32:55.055
Down, boys.

32:55.091 --> 32:56.657
Now you drop your gun.

32:56.692 --> 33:00.227
- And why would I do that?
- Because I'll shoot you.

33:03.833 --> 33:05.666
Well, well.

33:05.701 --> 33:06.701
You okay?

33:07.328 --> 33:09.113
JERVIS: This was your grand plan, James?

33:09.159 --> 33:12.473
Play along until Dr.
Calvi could sneak in

33:12.508 --> 33:14.742
and shoot me dead?

33:14.777 --> 33:16.644
Well, there's only one small problem.

33:16.679 --> 33:19.146
Before you arrived, I
went down to the basement,

33:19.181 --> 33:20.581
and switched the magazine

33:20.616 --> 33:21.982
in that gun with an empty one.

33:22.018 --> 33:23.491
(gun clicks)

33:23.596 --> 33:25.853
My apologies, Dr. Calvi.

33:25.888 --> 33:27.888
I only set the table for four.

33:27.923 --> 33:31.358
Dumfree, will you please escort
the doctor to the bathroom?

33:31.394 --> 33:35.095
I believe there's still
one chain in working order.

33:36.465 --> 33:38.165
Now...

33:38.200 --> 33:40.847
I'm out of patience.

33:42.450 --> 33:45.172
Who do you love?

33:45.207 --> 33:47.041
GORDON: You want to
talk about love, fine.

33:47.076 --> 33:49.343
Let's talk about who you love,

33:49.378 --> 33:50.577
- or loved.
- Don't.

33:50.613 --> 33:52.112
Your sister knew you were crazy, Jervis.

33:52.148 --> 33:53.263
Stop it.

33:53.333 --> 33:56.050
She was terrified of you. She hated you.

33:56.085 --> 33:57.851
- Enough.
- She told me...

33:58.519 --> 34:01.797
what you did to her when you were kids.

34:02.362 --> 34:04.224
The thought of you disgusted her.

34:04.260 --> 34:05.359
Lies! Deceit!

34:05.394 --> 34:07.227
The story you tell is incomplete.

34:07.263 --> 34:09.396
She loved me. She loved you?

34:09.431 --> 34:11.031
She killed herself
rather than be with you.

34:11.067 --> 34:12.833
She didn't... no.

34:12.868 --> 34:16.370
She impaled herself on a
spike and died in agony

34:16.405 --> 34:19.206
because even that was better
than having you touch her.

34:19.241 --> 34:21.007
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

34:21.043 --> 34:23.210
I saw her when she was dying.

34:23.245 --> 34:24.712
Her face...

34:24.746 --> 34:27.391
when she knew she was
finally safe from you,

34:28.184 --> 34:29.583
she was smiling.

34:29.618 --> 34:32.886
Because despite the pain, she was happy.

34:32.922 --> 34:34.554
Liar!

34:34.590 --> 34:38.525
She was the only thing I ever loved,

34:38.561 --> 34:40.360
and you, you...

34:40.396 --> 34:42.563
sent her soul to heaven above.

34:42.598 --> 34:44.031
Yes.

34:44.065 --> 34:46.533
That's right... me.

34:46.569 --> 34:48.435
I'm the one you want.

34:48.471 --> 34:51.071
So let Lee and Vale go.

34:51.107 --> 34:55.542
Keep me but let them go.

35:00.049 --> 35:02.583
(groaning): Oh, James.

35:02.618 --> 35:04.118
(exhales)

35:04.153 --> 35:06.724
You're trying to confuse me.

35:09.189 --> 35:11.058
But I won't let you.

35:11.093 --> 35:13.794
No. I'm determined

35:13.829 --> 35:16.964
that you'll live on and suffer

35:16.999 --> 35:19.255
without your love as I have.

35:20.522 --> 35:21.835
Choose.

35:25.474 --> 35:26.974
No. I won't choose.

35:27.009 --> 35:28.275
You will.

35:28.310 --> 35:29.810
You will.

35:29.845 --> 35:31.645
You'll certainly spill.

35:39.955 --> 35:41.221
I'll make it easy for you.

35:41.257 --> 35:42.723
On the count of three,

35:42.758 --> 35:46.026
instead of telling me who you love,

35:46.061 --> 35:48.794
tell me who to kill.

35:50.729 --> 35:52.132
Or I shoot them both of them,

35:52.168 --> 35:55.212
which would be such a thrill.

35:58.207 --> 35:59.493
One.

36:00.676 --> 36:02.976
(heart beating)

36:04.613 --> 36:06.847
Two.

36:06.882 --> 36:08.949
(heart beating)

36:11.887 --> 36:14.188
Three.

36:14.223 --> 36:15.489
Kill Lee.

36:15.524 --> 36:17.090
(gasps)

36:17.126 --> 36:18.926
Oh, finally.

36:18.961 --> 36:21.261
The truth is revealed.

36:21.297 --> 36:23.931
You chose Lee because you love Vale.

36:24.800 --> 36:28.001
- Very well.
- (groans, gasps)

36:28.037 --> 36:30.103
JERVIS: I knew you had it in you, James.

36:30.139 --> 36:33.507
All this time, you made everyone believe

36:33.542 --> 36:35.409
you were the hero,

36:35.444 --> 36:37.878
but deep down you always knew the truth.

36:37.913 --> 36:39.921
You're a villain.

36:40.583 --> 36:43.582
(Valerie whimpering)

36:43.639 --> 36:45.090
Vale.

36:47.718 --> 36:49.353
This is Dr. Leslie Thompkins.

36:49.388 --> 36:51.792
Please send an ambulance
to 25 Blackstone Drive.

36:51.827 --> 36:53.260
Hurry!

36:53.295 --> 36:54.495
Move.

36:55.522 --> 36:57.731
You're gonna be okay, Vale. You hear me?

36:57.766 --> 36:59.870
You're gonna be okay. Hold on.

37:06.811 --> 37:08.911
Victim's name is Valerie Vale.

37:08.946 --> 37:10.512
Gunshot wound to the abdomen.

37:10.548 --> 37:13.215
BP's 100/60.

37:13.251 --> 37:14.550
Tachy's at 160.

37:14.585 --> 37:16.552
O.R. One's prepped and ready to go.

37:16.587 --> 37:17.920
Clear the way.

37:17.955 --> 37:19.388
Clear the way, please.

37:19.423 --> 37:21.123
I've got her from here.

37:38.476 --> 37:40.476
(music playing)

37:41.746 --> 37:43.779
Ed.

37:43.814 --> 37:46.749
A man comes to a crossroads in his life,

37:46.784 --> 37:49.118
and he has to make a choice.

37:49.153 --> 37:52.421
Does he choose safety and cowardice

37:53.174 --> 37:56.064
or does he opt for courage
and risk everything?

37:57.428 --> 37:59.041
I choose courage.

38:02.700 --> 38:04.952
What I'm trying to say
is... (clears throat)

38:05.903 --> 38:10.005
The thing I've been wanting
to tell you all day long is...

38:12.977 --> 38:14.204
I love you.

38:31.062 --> 38:33.062
(woman singing in French in background)

38:38.758 --> 38:41.704
Impossible to pick the
perfect bottle, isn't it?

38:41.739 --> 38:44.907
Well, it all depends
on region and vintage.

38:44.942 --> 38:47.643
Of course, you have to
consider the wine pairing.

38:54.285 --> 38:55.911
Miss Kringle?

38:55.945 --> 38:58.954
No. Oh, no. My name's Isabella.

38:58.990 --> 39:02.767
Um, I'm sorry to bother you; I
don't usually talk to people.

39:02.801 --> 39:04.967
There's just, um, something about you.

39:04.978 --> 39:06.487
No, no, please. There's...

39:08.199 --> 39:10.366
There's no need to apologize.

39:10.401 --> 39:12.201
You ju...

39:13.011 --> 39:15.464
You remind me of someone
that I used to know.

39:16.547 --> 39:17.986
A long time ago.

39:24.315 --> 39:26.081
You struggle to regain me.

39:26.117 --> 39:27.927
When I'm lost...

39:28.753 --> 39:30.219
you struggle to obtain me.

39:31.064 --> 39:32.284
What am I?

39:34.411 --> 39:35.791
Time.

39:38.396 --> 39:40.095
I'm Edward.

39:41.365 --> 39:42.680
Edward Nygma.

39:46.437 --> 39:48.437
(sirens wailing in distance)

39:50.674 --> 39:52.574
Jim.

39:52.610 --> 39:55.641
- How is she?
- Still in surgery.

39:55.687 --> 39:57.846
She seems like a tough
cookie; she'll be all right.

39:57.882 --> 39:59.882
What about Tetch?

39:59.917 --> 40:01.917
We got the whole department
canvassing the city.

40:01.952 --> 40:03.267
We'll find him.

40:04.455 --> 40:06.922
Why didn't you come to me?

40:08.325 --> 40:09.717
I couldn't.

40:11.328 --> 40:13.762
And I thought I could save them both.

40:13.798 --> 40:16.665
You did what you thought was right.

40:16.700 --> 40:18.867
Maybe.

40:21.505 --> 40:23.934
In the end, I did
exactly what he wanted.

40:26.077 --> 40:28.007
He won.

40:32.383 --> 40:34.149
We'll see.

40:44.528 --> 40:46.528
(indistinct announcement over P.A.)

40:49.733 --> 40:51.633
Mario's a great doctor.

40:51.669 --> 40:53.007
She'll pull through.

40:58.533 --> 41:00.848
- Lee, about what I said...
- Jim.

41:02.333 --> 41:03.333
Not now.

41:04.305 --> 41:10.637
