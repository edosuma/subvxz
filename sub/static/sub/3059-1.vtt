04:35.200 --> 04:38.119
- Yeah.
- How'd it go?

04:38.120 --> 04:40.999
It fucking sucked, Bob.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.044
My heart goes out to you.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.319
You have my carburetor?

04:47.320 --> 04:48.759
Yeah, it's right over
there on the counter.

04:48.760 --> 04:51.566
Good to see you, too, buddy.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.079
Ah, hold it. Not so fast.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.479
God damn it.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.523
You owe me 60 bucks.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.603
- That's 50 bucks.
- That's all I got, Bob.

05:18.880 --> 05:22.279
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you, too, buddy.

05:24.520 --> 05:27.769
Jesus Christ.
Un-fucking-believable.

05:38.480 --> 05:42.679
Thatta boy. She is back to life.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.689
Good boy.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.648
Crazy old fuck.

06:28.600 --> 06:29.959
I got a question for you.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.881
You ever hear of a guy's
name who's Robert Wolf?

06:35.800 --> 06:38.002
Toss me the brake cleaner.

06:43.440 --> 06:44.880
Who's asking?

06:46.240 --> 06:48.199
Couple of suits.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.607
Said they were federal agents.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.239
The only Bob I know is you.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.959
Why don't you shut up and listen?

08:29.960 --> 08:32.119
This case has been
floundering for six months.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.958
You dropped the ball.
I'm sending Williams.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.159
Williams is a robot.
Nobody likes him.

08:36.159 --> 08:38.479
Yeah, he's gonna hold your hand.

08:38.480 --> 08:41.479
Just stay put. Don't have
an original thought.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.799
- Hey, Al.
- Hey, Joe.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.719
You look like shit.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.599
So what do you got?

08:49.600 --> 08:51.759
Our perp is Robert Wolf.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.759
He's a native from the
Mojave reservation.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.919
He comes off the reservation
and kills this Charles...

08:57.920 --> 09:00.679
- Grigsby.
- That's right. With a rock.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.679
Schaeffer is too close to this.

09:02.680 --> 09:05.679
He can't see the
forest for the trees.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.360
That's why I need you to go down
there and take care of this.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.803
I can smell you from here, son.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.846
Thanks, Pops.

09:37.200 --> 09:42.042
Make yourself useful and bring
over a piece of that dacite.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.359
- What are you making?
- Same old, same old.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.319
Making blades.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.759
Yeah? Let me see.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.201
Here you go.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.679
So where you been?

10:01.680 --> 10:03.484
Up in the Sierras mostly.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.282
How you taking care of yourself?

10:09.720 --> 10:12.199
Find a couple odd jobs.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.767
Helps me get by.

10:15.920 --> 10:19.442
You know, you look like shit, boy.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.761
Yeah, feel like shit, Dad.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.639
Well, go in and get
yourself cleaned up.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.559
Go get yourself something to eat.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.285
Yeah.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.919
Have the feds been here?

10:58.920 --> 11:01.691
Not since the funeral.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.208
How was the ceremony?

11:07.960 --> 11:09.399
Good.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.329
She was loved by many.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.079
Have you seen your sister?

11:15.080 --> 11:17.487
No.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.763
I haven't seen her or Irish.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.481
I told you what would happen.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.124
Yes, you did.

11:31.720 --> 11:34.571
And we tried it your way
and look where it got us.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.519
And look at what your
actions got you.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.119
I couldn't let him walk free.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.559
You're not the law.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.879
No, I'm not.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.839
But when justice isn't
served, then what, Dad?

11:49.840 --> 11:53.840
And your justice, what
has it given you?

11:58.760 --> 12:02.885
When they catch you, it'll be life.

12:08.520 --> 12:09.879
I'm here for Mom's ashes.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.959
I want to take her back
to where her life began.

12:11.960 --> 12:15.159
I want to take her so she
can start her journey.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.919
That's why I'm here.

12:16.920 --> 12:20.159
Her ashes are with your sister.

12:20.160 --> 12:24.410
Son, come with me to honor her.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.527
Yeah.

13:59.760 --> 14:04.039
Well, first up, I guess, in turning
over six months of my hard work,

14:04.040 --> 14:08.450
take you up here to the
site of the murder.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.839
Take you through it as best I can.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.761
Here it is on the left.
1402 Shithole Street.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.529
This is where it all went down.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.839
Well, this is where is happened.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.039
Chuck Grigsby's last stand.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.288
He lived in this palace here.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.879
Wolf got all done up
in the war paint.

14:38.880 --> 14:42.359
Found red and black everywhere.
That's the Mojave's colors.

14:42.360 --> 14:48.039
Then Wolf had that dacite club
knife thing that he'd made.

14:48.040 --> 14:51.679
Beat the scalp right off
of him there in the house.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.199
Charlie goes boogeying
through here,

14:54.200 --> 14:56.599
blood all in his face.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.559
Wolf caught up to him,

14:58.560 --> 15:02.399
beat every bone in that guy's body

15:02.400 --> 15:04.250
from his toes to his sternum.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.128
Turned the guy into a maraca.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.288
What a fucking way to go.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.885
Too good for him. Piece
of shit deserved it.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.290
Anyway, he...

15:25.880 --> 15:28.003
Hello?

15:29.480 --> 15:30.919
Son of a bitch.

15:30.920 --> 15:34.203
Standing around like a fucking
idiot talking to myself.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.568
Ahem.

18:08.480 --> 18:11.286
Is that your bike?

18:12.080 --> 18:14.760
It's a nice bike.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.039
You're bleeding.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.239
Yeah.

18:20.240 --> 18:23.319
I was teaching someone
how to fight.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.921
You should probably go
get that looked at.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.129
Nah.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.321
You know how to play that thing or
you just carry it around for show?

18:37.200 --> 18:39.119
It's for show.

18:39.120 --> 18:42.403
Come on down here and
have a drink with me.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.839
Hey, here. Hold this, brother.

18:48.840 --> 18:51.439
Help yourself.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.519
They say if you drink enough
bourbon, you'll have a time travel.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.919
Excuse me?

18:56.920 --> 18:59.168
You go into the...

18:59.960 --> 19:02.561
the future.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.639
I used to be in a band,
but not anymore.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.719
I'm sorry, what?

19:09.720 --> 19:12.730
I play music, too.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.399
Here.

19:15.400 --> 19:18.159
Oh, thanks, man.

19:18.160 --> 19:22.559
You got someone you can
call, get you home?

19:22.560 --> 19:25.479
Mm-hmm.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.399
Mmm.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.519
Ah, the future.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.639
Morning, sunshine.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.844
How's the head?

19:52.040 --> 19:54.039
What happened? What'd I do?

19:54.040 --> 19:56.288
I'm sorry.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.809
Will you help me find my bike?

20:02.680 --> 20:04.564
Yeah.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.608
Thanks.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.439
So, Bob.

20:13.440 --> 20:16.039
When's the last time you
saw old Robert Wolf?

20:16.040 --> 20:18.159
I told you before,
I don't know him.

20:18.160 --> 20:23.239
Yeah, well, I brought you a picture
this time to help with your memory.

20:23.240 --> 20:24.759
You seen him now?

20:24.760 --> 20:27.279
I don't know him,
so I ain't seen him.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.279
Uh-uh-uh.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.643
Don't touch the fucking car, man.

20:33.840 --> 20:37.439
Got to tell your dog to stop
snooping around in my garage.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.519
I will, Bob.

20:39.520 --> 20:42.359
Hey, what happened to the Panhead
that was here a couple days ago?

20:42.360 --> 20:45.319
I put a new carburetor
into it yesterday

20:45.320 --> 20:46.799
and the client came
and picked it up.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.959
Yeah? When was that?

20:48.960 --> 20:51.039
Yesterday.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.599
What was the client's name?

20:52.600 --> 20:55.279
I don't recall.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.479
What'd he look like?

20:56.480 --> 20:58.439
Don't recall that, either.

20:58.440 --> 21:01.119
God damn it, Bob.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.239
You're gonna have to start
recalling something.

21:03.240 --> 21:05.039
I'm a federal agent.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.799
Do you want to go back inside?
You're on parole.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.399
I'll make a call. You can
be in there tomorrow

21:10.400 --> 21:11.599
with your granddaughter visiting...

21:11.600 --> 21:15.441
Let me tell you something.
You want to arrest me, do it.

21:16.680 --> 21:20.119
Or else get the fuck
out of my shop.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.479
Damn, man.

21:32.360 --> 21:35.723
Oh, I needed that.

21:37.560 --> 21:39.279
Hell of a bike, man.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.359
What year is that?

21:41.360 --> 21:43.679
Mabel's a '57 Pan
with a '48 Springer.

21:43.680 --> 21:46.919
She act up on you much?

21:46.920 --> 21:49.521
- She's got a little bit of attitude.
- Oh, yeah, I bet.

21:51.120 --> 21:53.239
I dig that suicide shift.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.519
Nice shot.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.359
Used to have a '48 Knuckle myself.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.039
Yeah? Where is she?

22:02.040 --> 22:03.439
Alimony.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.719
That's why I ride this
piece-of-shit Yamaha.

22:06.720 --> 22:09.679
She looks like shit and
she sounds like shit,

22:09.680 --> 22:12.079
but the faithful bitch won't die.

22:12.080 --> 22:15.519
Yeah, well, it's not about
the bike, you know?

22:15.520 --> 22:19.239
It's about getting on the
road and being free.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.439
Yeah.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.719
It's better than the wind.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.719
What's her name?

22:26.720 --> 22:30.359
Dirty Fucking Whore,
after my ex-wife.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.199
So, where you headed?

22:43.200 --> 22:45.599
South. I'm gonna go
see some family.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.199

Wolf needs a woman that

24:36.840 --> 24:39.679

24:39.680 --> 24:41.644
You stay away from my husband.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.519
Hey, man, where you going?

24:44.520 --> 24:47.239
- This is your job.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.799
What do you mean you're good?

26:57.800 --> 27:00.799
Come on, have some waffles.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.839
It's all you. There you go.

27:02.840 --> 27:04.839
- You don't want any?
- No.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.919
- You're sure?
- I'm positive.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.479
All right. Can I borrow some cash?

27:09.480 --> 27:12.524
Well, I'm a little short, so
you're gonna have to get this one.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.999
Christ, Wolf. I don't
have any money for this.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.168
What?

27:21.440 --> 27:23.759
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Dude, we can't walk out.

27:23.760 --> 27:25.962
You guys don't have
any money, do you?

27:27.760 --> 27:30.199
You mean American money?

27:30.200 --> 27:31.759
That's really cute.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.759
I'm gonna call the police.
How about that, okay?

27:33.760 --> 27:36.359
Listen, hey, I', s... we can
work something out, okay?

27:36.360 --> 27:38.439
Please?

27:38.440 --> 27:41.599
Dude, I didn't follow
you to do charity work.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.484
I didn't ask you to follow me.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.682
I got to make money. And
not the fucking hard way.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.799
Hey, whoa, whoa. Whoa, excuse me.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.039

27:56.040 --> 27:58.679
I'm going to take a piss, Todd.
You got an itch to hold it?

27:58.680 --> 28:01.999
You know what? I gave you a break and
let you try to work off your debt.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.279
Shut up.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.239
I don't need to be disrespected

28:08.480 --> 28:10.279
I'm sorry. I'm gonna do the dishes.

28:10.280 --> 28:13.006
I'm almost done, okay?
I apologize. He's an asshole.

28:14.280 --> 28:17.324
Just finish up and please
don't come back here anymore.

28:33.640 --> 28:36.519
Hey, sorry, man. That

34:58.440 --> 35:00.919

35:00.920 --> 35:03.319
I need some Marlboro Reds, please.

35:39.240 --> 35:41.488
How you doing?

35:43.280 --> 35:45.839
Numay, good to see you.

35:45.840 --> 35:48.247
- This is...
- Agent Williams, "Numy."

35:49.720 --> 35:52.079
It's Numay.

35:52.080 --> 35:55.319
- I heard you were in town.
- Did you, now?

35:55.320 --> 35:58.279
It seems any time a rape
occurs on the reservation,

35:58.280 --> 36:00.239
you guys are nowhere to be found.

36:00.240 --> 36:03.039
But a white man's murdered and
it's call out the cavalry.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.239
You know, he's...

36:05.240 --> 36:06.719
he's got a point there.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.839
Look, we're getting off on
the wrong foot here, Numay.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.239
We just want to find Wolf.
We want to keep him safe.

36:11.240 --> 36:12.759
You know where he's at?

36:12.760 --> 36:14.319
No.

36:14.320 --> 36:16.919
We're getting calls every five
minutes. I know he's in town.

36:16.920 --> 36:19.279
You know he and I
don't see eye to eye.

36:19.280 --> 36:20.439
Yeah.

36:20.440 --> 36:22.399
Well, I guess that
doesn't surprise me

36:22.400 --> 36:25.490
seeing as you're a lawman
and he's a wanted fugitive.

36:28.200 --> 36:33.759
Mr. Williams, my wife was
raped and beaten in our home.

36:33.760 --> 36:37.439
I abided by the law.
I arrested him.

36:37.440 --> 36:40.639
And you see where that got me.

36:40.640 --> 36:43.559
Well, I deeply sympathize
with your family's loss,

36:43.560 --> 36:47.239
but you can't go around taking the law
into your own hands, now, can you?

36:47.240 --> 36:50.279
So why don't you and I stop
wasting each other's time

36:50.280 --> 36:52.919
and you tell me where he's going?

36:52.920 --> 36:55.919
Unfortunately,

36:55.920 --> 36:59.647
glory cases are not my department.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.679
- That a '56?
- '55.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.439
Looks good.

37:24.440 --> 37:26.839
Better when she runs.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.759
What's wrong with her?

37:28.760 --> 37:30.405
Radiator's shot.

37:31.280 --> 37:33.679
I can help.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.247
I can handle it.

37:47.320 --> 37:50.046
Oh, fuck.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.683
Still want to help?

38:23.560 --> 38:26.240
Come on, is that all you got?

38:26.240 --> 38:27.919
Almost.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.679
- Thanks, Bob.
- Nice to meet you, Cash.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.723
Good luck.

38:40.680 --> 38:42.279
Thank you.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.562
- We did it.
- You did it.

38:45.440 --> 38:48.359
- Wolf.
- Wolf. I like that, Wolf.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.439
Um, Magdalena.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.359
Magdalena.

38:52.360 --> 38:54.639
Um...

38:54.640 --> 38:56.919
so I have another favor to ask you.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.479
What?

38:58.480 --> 39:00.719
I live about a mile down the road.

39:00.720 --> 39:03.239
I could obviously use a ride.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.999
- Would you?
- Love to.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.771
Great. I'll grab my stuff.

39:12.440 --> 39:15.199
You know how hard it is to sell
a house in today's market?

39:15.200 --> 39:17.319
- Hard.
- Very hard.

39:17.320 --> 39:19.519
Especially when it's been trashed.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.519
This is why we're not
together anymore, Cash.

39:21.520 --> 39:25.039
You sabotage everything.
Seriously, you're like a child.

39:25.040 --> 39:27.439
I've got potential buyers
standing there with me

39:27.440 --> 39:28.599
and I look like an asshole.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.559
Now, would you rather
file for bankruptcy?

39:30.560 --> 39:32.359
Because that's the only option
you're leaving me with.

39:32.360 --> 39:34.961
Just sell the fucking house, Linda.

44:35.880 --> 44:37.799
The dances.

I figured out some shit
last night, though.

51:30.360 --> 51:32.801

51:33.960 --> 51:37.130

51:38.120 --> 51:41.403
I also figured out I might
have a drinking problem.

51:43.440 --> 51:45.324
Maybe.

51:50.240 --> 51:52.522
Then I was thinking, man...

man. You know?

51:56.640 --> 51:58.968

52:37.360 --> 52:38.559

Mm-hmm.

53:49.360 --> 53:52.291
Do you know why I'm here?

53:56.360 --> 53:59.999
I'm looking for a great big Mojave

54:00.000 --> 54:04.119
going by the name of Robert Wolf.

54:04.120 --> 54:06.239
He came by here yesterday.

54:06.240 --> 54:08.959
What did he want?

54:08.960 --> 54:10.839
Money.

54:10.840 --> 54:12.769
And?

54:15.320 --> 54:17.279
Came by with a white guy.

54:17.280 --> 54:19.369
Was it Irish?

54:21.400 --> 54:23.839
No, some other white guy.

54:23.840 --> 54:26.771
Irish doesn't live here anymore.

54:28.320 --> 54:29.479
Good.

54:29.480 --> 54:32.319
Now, which way did he go?

54:32.320 --> 54:34.329
I don't know.

54:35.320 --> 54:37.284
You don't know?

54:40.600 --> 54:43.406
And you know where Irish
lives, don't you?

54:45.000 --> 54:47.009
Don't know.

54:52.440 --> 54:55.962
You know what? I believe you.

55:11.560 --> 55:13.603
Who's Irish?

55:14.600 --> 55:19.479
Um, you know, Irish.
He's Timmy Murphy.

55:19.480 --> 55:21.519
You know, married to Wolf's sister.

55:21.520 --> 55:24.610
They used to run together.
It's in the report.

55:25.600 --> 55:27.879
- It's in the report?
- Yeah.

55:27.880 --> 55:32.159
Yeah, I think. Maybe not.

55:32.160 --> 55:35.842
I don't know. Irish is
Timmy Murphy. There.

55:37.520 --> 55:39.119
Well, I'd like to meet him.

55:39.120 --> 55:42.519
Yeah, well, you can't.
He's 500 miles away.

55:42.520 --> 55:44.879
They're up north now.
They're out of the picture.

55:44.880 --> 55:46.359
We got people on it,

55:46.360 --> 55:49.479
but there's no way Wolf's
going over there for dinner.

55:49.480 --> 55:51.967
Guy's wanted for murder
and he's not an idiot.

55:53.480 --> 55:57.526

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.279

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.399
We're coming up the road
there on our motorcycles

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.679
and we saw the boy on
the side of the road.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.008
He had blood on his shirt.
He has blood on his face.

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.759
We stopped.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.919
We followed him down to the
ravine about half a mile back.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.319

- Stop right there.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.119

gunpoint at the ranger 103.

- No, we're just trying to help.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.919
Shut your mouth!

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.279

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.799

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:25.291
Yeah.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.039
This is Officer Sosi.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.799
I have one white male suspect
down by the river entrance.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.519

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:37.690

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.439
They're coming. Get out of here.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.608
Why the hell are we running?

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.048
You got something you
want to tell me?

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.559
Look, Wolf,

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.411
just be straight with me,
man. That's all I'm asking.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:24.168
My mom was raped.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:29.686
When my father found
her in our house...

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:35.050
she was beaten so badly, he
couldn't even recognize her.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:44.439
We had to put her on life support

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.039
'cause she couldn't
breathe on her own.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.439
She couldn't eat.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.210
She couldn't speak.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.959
She was gone.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.279
They catch the guy?

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:59.131
Tribal police found him
and they arrested him.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:05.329
But because he wasn't native, he's
got to be tried in a federal court.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.999
Federal prosecutors
declined the case

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.047
because apparently it
wasn't serious enough.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.399
They hold him for a year

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:23.126
and then they release him.

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.084
Six months ago, I tracked the
man down and I killed him.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.328
Been on the run ever since.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.962
Morning, sunshine.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:38.082

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.243
It's hot.

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.839
Sorry I went through your pack.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.042

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.323

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.131
- Really?
- Yeah, it's disgusting.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.281
Seriously.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.724
Cheers.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.369
Thanks, man.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:21.009
So, where we going?

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.569
This place is amazing.

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.519
Something I can help you with?

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:59.719
Yeah, you sure can.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:02.559
How much for this? All this stuff.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.759
All these knickknacks and whatnot.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:09.407
I'd like to buy it, your place.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.879
It's not for sale, my man.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.839
Well, I was hoping maybe we
could work out an arrangement.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.359
Get the fuck off my property.

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:25.961
Ooh, tough guy.

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.719
I fucking knew it!

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:32.679
You got seven seconds to get
off my property, motherfucker.

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:37.488
Fuck!

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:42.158
Who is that?

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.559
That's Cash. Irish, Cash.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.999
- How you doing?
- You motherfucker.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.759
I almost fucking tuned you up, man.

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:52.639
God damn it.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.519
You want a beer for that?

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.839
Oh, I'd love a beer.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.759
I would, too.

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.883
When do you not?

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.562
I got something I got to show you.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.679
Come with me. Come here.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.008
Come, come.

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:20.683
Wolf, meet Wolf.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.884
This is your godson.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.370
Good job.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.362
Where is she?

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:47.363
Oh!

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.842
Let's go get that drink.

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.119
- He has Mom's spirit.
- Really?

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.399
- Mmm.
- He looks beautiful.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:09.524
Thank God he looks like you.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.967
I miss this.

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.403
Can you stay?

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:22.999
I wish I could, but I can't.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.441
You know I can't.

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:38.768
You seen Dad?

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.719
- You talk to him?
- No, no.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.002
You know, not...

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.568
Not since the funeral, no.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:53.359
I want to take Mom's ashes.

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.239
I want to take her to the lake.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.799
She would have wanted it that way.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.399
Yeah. I think... yeah.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.399
- I think she'd...
- Hey.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.171
- She wanted that.
- Yeah, she did.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.279
But, you know, I also...

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.559
kind of wanted to spread
her ashes around here

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.559
'cause I want Wolf to
know that she was around.

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:20.924
I just think so.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.999
- I just want to take some.
- Okay.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.999
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.488
- We're just gonna share, okay?
- Yeah, we'll share.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.044
I'm not sorry for what I did.

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.528
Not at all.

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.683
I'm sorry for what I've lost.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.119
Cash, I sold the house.

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.639
I sold the house first
thing this morning.

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.199
Wow, that's...

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.479
I mean, it wasn't our asking price,

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.808
but it's not bad
considering the market.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.359
Cash?

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.642
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.804
So where are you?

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:21.049
Um, I'm with a friend.

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:26.319
So... so that's it, then.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.091
I guess we're done.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.279
Take care of yourself, Cash.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.639
I mean that.

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.319
Yeah.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.851

God damn it.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.002
Wasn't sure I was
gonna see you again.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.726
You know something, Wolf?

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:29.126
I'd have done the same
fucking thing you did.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.770
I just wanted you to know that.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.244
You're a good man.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.399
I love you.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:45.080
All right, you ready?

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:48.128
Come on, man, I'll take
you up to the lake.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.044
What's wrong, baby?

01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:00.244
Irish. Welcome home.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.759
Who the fuck are you?

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.567
Agent Williams, FBI.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:12.319
Sweetie, can you take
Wolf upstairs, please?

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.159
Wolf?

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.559
Touching.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.239
After your brother the murderer?

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:21.839
One Robert J. Wolf. Where is he?

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.719
Listen here, you son of
a bitch. I know my rights.

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:27.759
So unless you got a goddamn warrant,
you get the fuck off my property.

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:33.521
A goddamn warrant.

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:40.519
You know, I don't like
this any more than you.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.919
But we're here because your
brother brought us here

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:46.124
to your house and your son.

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:50.839
You know, you're a
very lucky man, Irish.

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:55.399
Now, tell me where he is.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:59.279
Agent Williams, I'd
like to help you out,

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.324
but the truth is we haven't
seen him in years, right?

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.762
So you can go fuck yourself.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:16.246
That was a federal offense.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.599
Now you listen to me, you fuck.
I'm gonna tear your family apart.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.879
You want to harbor a fugitive,
you're federally fucked for life.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:05.799
And you, Eva, you're an
accomplice. Two years minimum.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.759
Child services aren't
what they used to be.

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:17.279
Schaeffer, take
Mrs. Murphy to the car.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.439
- No, no, no. Don't.
- No, no, no, no.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.599
- I'll take the child.
- No!

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:23.479
Baby! Baby!

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.279
Let go of my son!

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.919
Bring my wife back!

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:30.239
Put my son down, you
sick motherfuck!

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:33.439
Irish, I know he's been here.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.399
- Bring my wife back.
- You're gonna tell me where he is.

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:38.559
- Bring my wife back.
- Shh. That's a good baby.

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.879
Look at me, you sick fuck!
Put my baby down!

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.119
- Irish, his bike's in the garage.
- God damn it!

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.719
- Shh.
- Look at me. Look at me.

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:48.479
Look at me, you sick motherfucker.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.759
- Daddy's got a dirty mouth.
- Let go of my son.

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.919
Put my son down. Put my son down.

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:55.039
Daddy's gonna tell us where he is.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.599
He is, yeah.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.559
Tell me where he is.

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:03.799
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!
Let's make a deal.

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.959
Let's make a deal.

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.359
No deal.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.839
Tell me where he is.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.759
Fucking son of a bitch.

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.928
Then let's talk.

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:19.400
Tell me where he is.

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:24.527
- Just bring my wife back.
- Tell me where he fucking is!

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:27.759
Tell me where he is!

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.919
Stop, stop, stop.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:32.964
At the lake.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.519
How much further?

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:50.291
It's at the base of that mountain.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.679
You sure?

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:57.008
Yeah.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:09.039
Ooh!

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:27.359
The lake's this way.
It's over here.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.847
What are you doing?

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.679
You gonna... all right.

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:48.201
If you guys want to
be lost in the woods.

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.044
This is it.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.123
It's pretty.

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.921
- I'll be over there, all right?
- All right.

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.399
Wolf! Run!

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.728
Run!

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.959
- Schaeffer!
- Shit.

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:10.039
Wolf, freeze right there!

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:12.359
Take the shot! Take the shot!

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:16.199
Schaeffer, take him down!

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.359
Wolf, freeze, God damn it!

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.599
Schaeffer, take him fucking down!

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.199
Shut the fuck up!

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:26.599
Wolf!

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.719
God damn it.

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.649
Sorry, Wolf.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:40.883
Fuck!

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.559
No! Wolf!

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:33.240
No!

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:02.319
Help!

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.319
Stay with me, buddy.

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.568
Hey, stay with me.

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:11.839
Hey, don't give up.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.679
Don't go.

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.167
Somebody help!

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.680
Somebody fucking help!

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.688
You happy?

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:32.161
You got your man.

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.090
Go fish him out.

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:45.484
Somebody!

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.281
Somebody help!
