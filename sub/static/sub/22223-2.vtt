WEBVTT

00:01.294 --> 00:03.330
Previously on Farscape.

00:03.421 --> 00:05.457
We all knew the time would come
when we'd split up.

00:05.548 --> 00:07.960
I'm coming with you.
-No, I'm sorry.

00:08.050 --> 00:11.383
Aeryn is with child.

00:12.138 --> 00:14.220
Pilot:
Commander, stay clear.

00:14.307 --> 00:15.672
We're being drawn in...

00:15.766 --> 00:17.302
Captain... you....

00:21.397 --> 00:24.184
| suggest you aim that
behind you.

00:24.275 --> 00:27.187
The creatures following me
execute on sight.

00:27.278 --> 00:28.984
-Chiana.
-Hey.

00:30.489 --> 00:31.274
Nice to see ya.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.276
And you haven't seen Moya?

00:33.367 --> 00:35.528
If an officer superior to
you ordered it,

00:35.620 --> 00:38.032
I would similarly execute you
without hesitation.

00:38.122 --> 00:44.493
So says every one of your
psychological evaluations,
Captain Braca.

00:44.587 --> 00:47.454
Grayza is a manipulator.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.130
I understand you no longer have
a ship to command.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.174
Old Pilot:
We would like to
repay our debt.

00:52.261 --> 00:55.628
You don't owe us anything.

00:55.723 --> 00:58.135
Nevertheless, if we are able,

00:58.226 --> 01:03.220
you shall arrive at the planet
where you think your
friends may be.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.601
And now on Farscape.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.396
That do it?

01:10.488 --> 01:14.231
Elack senses a planet,

01:14.325 --> 01:17.863
but the erratic weather
patterns are interfering.

01:17.954 --> 01:20.036
Oh, frell!

01:20.122 --> 01:22.078
Sparky, can you fix scan?

01:22.166 --> 01:24.373
I'm trying.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.041
Come here and hold this.

01:26.128 --> 01:27.254
Hold 'em yourself.

01:27.338 --> 01:28.703
( groans )

01:28.798 --> 01:32.632
Crichton, why are we searching
for this planet?

01:32.718 --> 01:35.334
Arnessk is uninhabitable.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.967
No. Jool told us every few
cycles the magnetics
drop low enough

01:39.058 --> 01:41.140
for the dig team to remain
there for awhile.

01:41.227 --> 01:42.137
Help me!

01:42.228 --> 01:43.764
My hand is still too weak.

01:43.854 --> 01:49.099
Yeah, right. Pull the other one
and I'll whistle "Felinnoosen".

01:49.193 --> 01:53.653
No life-forms are registering
on Elack's senses,

01:53.739 --> 01:56.196
but I... but I'm so weak,

01:56.284 --> 01:59.117
|... I... can't be sure.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.159
Shh. Rest.

02:01.247 --> 02:03.203
You rest, sweetheart.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.280
We're gonna go check it out.

02:04.375 --> 02:06.912
Hey, Crichton, don't go
down without me.

02:07.003 --> 02:10.291
ldon't wanna be here when
Psycho zaps the final zalk.

02:25.104 --> 02:27.186
Chiana:
I don't see anyone.

02:27.273 --> 02:29.309
You see anyone?

02:29.400 --> 02:30.640
No.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.940
(gasping)

02:37.408 --> 02:39.319
What's the matter?

02:39.410 --> 02:41.401
| just got a feeling.

02:42.413 --> 02:46.998
Well, is that a "feeling"
feeling or...

02:48.294 --> 02:51.252
Just a feeling.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.125
Okay.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.377
Okay, now I'm getting a feeling.
You're not getting a feeling?

02:59.472 --> 03:01.303
No, no feelings.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.051
Hang on. Take this. Take this.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.348
My chakan oil's low.

03:04.435 --> 03:05.891
Right.

03:08.105 --> 03:10.562
Then again, I might have
had a feeling.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.981
Get back.

03:13.069 --> 03:14.400
Peacekeeper, drop your weapon.

03:14.487 --> 03:16.773
That's a common mistake.
I'm not a Peacekeeper.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.900
Drop your weapon or
the female dies.

03:18.991 --> 03:19.901
Chiana:
He's not a Peacekeeper.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.368
Wait! Tarnat, stop.

03:21.452 --> 03:23.113
Ha ha! John!

03:23.204 --> 03:25.286
D'Argol

03:25.373 --> 03:26.829
Oh, you're breaking my back!
Let go!

03:26.916 --> 03:28.998
We didn't know it was you, so
we hid. But it's you!

03:29.085 --> 03:30.825
Look at you!

03:30.920 --> 03:32.205
Yeah, it's really me, Princess.

03:32.296 --> 03:33.411
John!
-D'Argo!

03:33.506 --> 03:35.292
Chiana!

03:35.383 --> 03:37.339
Who is this Peacekeeper?
-How bout them Bears...

03:37.426 --> 03:38.666
Why is he with the tralk?

03:38.761 --> 03:40.752
He's not a Peacekeeper.
-She's not a tralk.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.382
Forgive Tarnat. He's new
security here

03:42.473 --> 03:46.762
and he's just a little gung-ho
about protecting the dig.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.388
You've been warned.

03:48.479 --> 03:50.936
There are races who would kill
for what we've discovered.

03:51.023 --> 03:53.059
Jool:
Tarnat! These are my friends.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.641
So, are Aeryn and Rygel
with you?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.192
Rygel, yeah.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.406
Aeryn we haven't heard from.
Has she contacted you?

03:59.490 --> 04:03.449
No, not yet.
But, uh, you know, she will.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.823
Right.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.381
ls Moya here?

04:19.468 --> 04:21.208
We didn't detect her when
we came aboard.

04:21.303 --> 04:22.292
No.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.218
Jool:
...and then we're gonna
look for Aeryn.

04:27.309 --> 04:29.891
You know what? You've got to
come and meet...

04:31.355 --> 04:33.141
Tarnat:
I don't think the instructor
would want that.

04:33.232 --> 04:37.521
Tarnat, just put it back in
your pants and calm down.

04:40.573 --> 04:42.154
Cheer up, John.

04:42.241 --> 04:47.235
l have a lot to tell you
about my travels.

04:47.329 --> 04:48.614
Jool:
Can you believe it, we're here.

04:48.706 --> 04:52.619
We're here and we're alive and
nobody is trying to kill us.

04:52.710 --> 04:54.200
Come on.

05:17.234 --> 05:21.102
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

05:21.197 --> 05:24.735
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.611
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

05:26.702 --> 05:29.910
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

05:29.997 --> 05:31.737
my friends.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.615
I've made enemies.

05:34.710 --> 05:37.952
Powerful, dangerous.

05:38.047 --> 05:41.539
Now all I want is to
find a way home

05:41.634 --> 05:44.376
to warn Earth.

05:44.470 --> 05:49.555
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.751
Jool:
Check this out.

06:23.842 --> 06:26.675
This is the most important
planet in the universe!

06:26.762 --> 06:29.094
Jool, Moya got spat out
like a fur ball.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.137
How the hell did that happen?
-Stop. That's all I remember.

06:31.225 --> 06:34.308
Please, D'Argo's gone to find
the weird old lady and she'll
explain what happened.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.636
She spoke to Pilot
for arns, okay?

06:38.232 --> 06:41.224
These sensors are for
the magnetics.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.274
When it's blue,
the levels are safe.

06:43.362 --> 06:47.230
Red is bad.
Red means don't pack, fly.

06:49.743 --> 06:50.778
But this...

06:50.869 --> 06:52.951
this is what I was
talking about.

06:53.038 --> 06:57.327
This is the greatest
archeological discovery of the
last one thousand cycles.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.954
This?

06:59.044 --> 07:02.036
Yeah. I mean, it may not
look like much to the
untrained eye...

07:02.131 --> 07:03.871
My eye's okay, Princess.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.129
Hey, is that valuable?

07:07.219 --> 07:09.175
I'm not sure but I'll run some
tests and check...

07:09.263 --> 07:10.753
Ah!

07:10.848 --> 07:12.179
Nice arm.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.722
(Chiana chuckles)
What are you doing?

07:13.809 --> 07:16.642
As fantastic as this is,
I'll take the tour later.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.525
What is her problem?
What did I do?

07:25.613 --> 07:26.898
Nothing. You did nothing.

07:26.989 --> 07:30.698
She just had a rough time
away from Moya.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.036
Jool, if it's all right,
I'm gonna find Grandma.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.202
No, no, no! Stay here.
D'Argo's getting her.

07:35.289 --> 07:38.122
Please, just wait here and let
me show you all this, please.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.709
Please!

07:39.793 --> 07:41.294
D'Argo?

07:43.464 --> 07:45.329
Wrinkles?

07:59.229 --> 08:00.389
Frell.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.682
It's remarkable, isn't it?

08:04.777 --> 08:06.313
You scared me.

08:06.403 --> 08:10.863
I don't know. I thought you
were gonna go find Wrinkles.

08:10.949 --> 08:13.110
l was. I couldn't find her
down by the cliffs

08:13.202 --> 08:16.285
so I thought she might
have come here.

08:16.372 --> 08:19.614
It's... It's good to see
you again, Chi.

08:21.418 --> 08:24.660
Jool:
12,000 cycles ago, Arnesskan
priests worshipped.

08:24.755 --> 08:29.124
Mystics. Somehow they maintained
a truce with the Scarrans and
the Peacekeepers

08:29.218 --> 08:31.925
for 500 generations.

08:32.012 --> 08:35.300
Imagine. Imagine if we could
discover their secret for peace.

08:35.391 --> 08:38.474
No one knows how they
achieved it because...

08:38.560 --> 08:39.970
one day, they just vanished.

08:40.062 --> 08:43.179
And it's like everyone just
left in a microt.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.137
And no one....

08:44.233 --> 08:46.440
Both:
...knows why.

08:47.653 --> 08:49.518
I know why.

08:51.699 --> 08:54.031
This is Instructor Vella.

08:54.118 --> 08:56.325
You're John Crichton.

08:57.413 --> 08:59.199
Yes.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.826
Tarnat said I'd find you here.

09:01.917 --> 09:04.829
I see why he mistook
you for Sebacean.

09:04.920 --> 09:09.539
Same size, weight, coloring.

09:10.676 --> 09:13.258
Though the brain cavity
appears smaller.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.336
Yeah, but my choppers
are first class

09:15.431 --> 09:17.137
and I do an excellent
turn my head and cough.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.260
( coughing )
-What?

09:19.351 --> 09:21.433
I see you're not interested
in any of this.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.683
I just have some unfinished
business to attend to.

09:24.773 --> 09:28.140
This is more fascinating than
any business you might have.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.102
Believe it or not, this planet
was once a paradise.

09:31.196 --> 09:34.905
Virgin water, panoply
of life-forms.

09:34.992 --> 09:38.359
But three of these probes,
which form the Darnaz Triangle,

09:38.454 --> 09:41.321
were launched by
enemies of peace.

09:41.415 --> 09:44.157
They created magnetic summers
that killed the priests

09:44.251 --> 09:46.833
and drove civilization away.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.501
You understanding any of this?

09:48.589 --> 09:52.298
(yokel-Iike accent):
Well, I missed a couple of
the big words,

09:52.384 --> 09:53.999
so maybe I should just...

09:55.304 --> 10:00.219
Instructor Vella has found
two of the probes.

10:00.309 --> 10:04.598
Legend has it if I find
the third probe, I can
reverse its damage,

10:04.688 --> 10:07.600
and so reactivate the
Darnaz Triangle.

10:10.736 --> 10:12.943
Jool started to drive
you crazy yet?

10:13.030 --> 10:16.488
She... she just keeps going on
and on about this place.

10:16.575 --> 10:20.284
Well, it, uh, can be
like an obsession.

10:20.370 --> 10:24.033
We've been working from
dawn till dusk.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.035
You and the princess?

10:26.126 --> 10:27.411
Mm-hmm.

10:32.424 --> 10:35.257
You and the princess?

10:35.344 --> 10:39.553
Did the Peacekeepers capture you
and... and... steal your brain

10:39.640 --> 10:41.505
and replace it with whatever
you're using now?

10:41.600 --> 10:43.306
What's the matter?

10:46.396 --> 10:49.684
They're always this far away
from getting me. How come they
they didn't get you?

10:49.775 --> 10:51.140
Lo'La hid me.

10:51.235 --> 10:52.691
Lola?

10:53.153 --> 10:54.768
Lo'La.

10:55.531 --> 10:58.147
(speaking Luxan )

11:01.286 --> 11:03.823
Your ship can disappear.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.200
For a short time.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.326
And you named her Lo'La?

11:11.713 --> 11:13.374
It's short for Lo'Laan.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.501
In memory of my wife.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.595
Crichton:
Ryg, D'Argo and Jool are here

11:28.689 --> 11:30.771
and D'Argo's got his ship back.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.474
They expect that Moya's gonna
be back sometime soon.

11:33.569 --> 11:35.525
Well, she'd better hurry.

11:35.612 --> 11:39.150
I can barely hear you and the
heat's nakked in here.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.577
Crichton, this Leviathan
is dying.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.868
We've got to get off it soon.

11:45.956 --> 11:47.696
( Crichton's voice breaking up )

11:47.791 --> 11:48.871
Crichton?

11:49.376 --> 11:50.240
Crichton?!

11:50.335 --> 11:52.667
Were you still talking? Sorry.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.461
Connect me back to Crichton.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.165
Cannot do it.
External comms are dead.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.342
This ship is entering
termination shutdown.

12:00.429 --> 12:05.549
In case we need it in a few
arns, I want to get
this module started.

12:11.356 --> 12:12.857
Pilot and Moya.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.897
Crichton and the others
are here on Arnessk.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.772
Their presence is a source
of irritation.

12:17.863 --> 12:22.106
Retrieve them now or we'll have
to take our own steps.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.567
We intercepted this transmission
to Moya 60 microts ago.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.163
You were right.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.205
They did follow the
Interion to the planet.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.908
How long will it take for our
Command Carrier to get there?

12:33.003 --> 12:34.493
Ten arns.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.670
Make it five.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.168
Captain.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.089
But first...

12:43.180 --> 12:45.216
come and see this.

12:49.311 --> 12:50.676
(gasps )

12:50.771 --> 12:52.853
I find your amateur
attempts at...

12:54.316 --> 12:55.977
torture...

12:56.068 --> 12:58.229
to be quite pleasurable.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.106
I could resist it for cycles.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.812
Maybe you can...

13:01.907 --> 13:05.024
or maybe you can't.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.654
( high-pitched whirring )

13:06.745 --> 13:10.533
But this rod will make it
a little more difficult.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.328
(gasping)

13:13.418 --> 13:16.034
Don't do this, Braca.
I made you.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.209
No.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.208
I made you.

13:19.299 --> 13:25.010
I think now you will finally
tell me all you know about
John Crichton.

13:25.097 --> 13:27.213
I told you everything about
John Crichton!

13:27.307 --> 13:30.094
No, Scorpius.

13:33.563 --> 13:37.101
You hold onto secrets because
you fear that when you finally

13:37.192 --> 13:40.275
do tell me everything,
you will die.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.853
And you're probably right.

13:47.661 --> 13:50.118
Crichton:
Grandma?

13:50.205 --> 13:53.914
Vella:
I studied his response as I told
him of the Darnaz Triangle.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.333
He has no interest in it.

13:56.420 --> 13:59.207
No, don't worry.
It'll be over soon.

13:59.297 --> 14:02.209
Our last vector test will
reveal the third probe.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.171
Oh, damn! Grandma!

14:05.262 --> 14:08.925
Damn! The creature from
the Black Lagoon, sorta.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.090
Grandma, how you doing?

14:12.978 --> 14:15.344
You remember me?

14:15.439 --> 14:18.852
Me, Crichton, you, Grandma.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.443
Get away, Oo-nii. Go on, scat.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.439
Go on. Go on, scat. Go on.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.613
I remember. You're hoo-man.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.906
Right.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.867
Crichton!

14:31.455 --> 14:33.286
Oh! Ah! Damn!

14:33.373 --> 14:34.829
You need a bath.

14:34.916 --> 14:37.407
Never bathe. Never bathe.
No, no. Washes off the juice.

14:37.502 --> 14:40.369
That's more than
I wanna know.

14:40.464 --> 14:44.924
Listen, Jool said that you guys
got spat out of a wormhole.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.921
She said that only you knew
what happened.

14:47.012 --> 14:49.128
Ask Pilot. Pilot knows.
I talked to Pilot.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.258
Pilot knows what?
-No, no, ask him.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.429
I must follow Vella.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.018
Hey, I need to know about...

14:54.102 --> 14:56.343
How old are you? How old?

14:56.438 --> 14:59.396
I am 293 cycles.

14:59.483 --> 15:01.849
Anytime there is goodness,
it will be destroyed.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.525
By... by a cause, or weapon.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.194
(gasps )

15:06.281 --> 15:09.489
Oh, yes, yes, this is
Holy Land. Yes.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.158
Oh, no, I won't let Vella
have any of it.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.236
It's the voices, the voices.
They scream to me.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.788
The Darnaz Triangle must
never be used again.

15:16.875 --> 15:19.116
I don't hear your voices.

15:19.211 --> 15:21.202
( growling )
-Back off!

15:21.296 --> 15:22.706
Get back. Go on.

15:22.798 --> 15:24.334
Get back.

15:30.055 --> 15:32.888
I'm not interested in
your voices.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.556
You know what I'm
interested in.

15:35.644 --> 15:37.100
Aeryn's child.

15:37.187 --> 15:39.599
You pierced my
subliminal message.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.431
Yeah. And I might have stopped
her if I'd known sooner.

15:42.526 --> 15:44.437
Why would you want to stop her?

15:44.528 --> 15:47.486
She's carrying my child.
Well, my DNA.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.564
Oh, I didn't keep that secret
from you. She did.

15:50.659 --> 15:54.823
And Ijust wanted you to
accept Aeryn's decision.

15:54.913 --> 15:57.620
But now, I can help you forget.

15:59.543 --> 16:03.502
Laka. It's all over
this planet.

16:03.588 --> 16:07.046
Squeeze the juice meat out of
it and stick it up your nose.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.340
You'll get a jolt. Wham!

16:08.426 --> 16:11.293
And for 500 microts,
nothing bothers you.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.595
No think of Aeryn. Nothing.

16:13.682 --> 16:17.300
Get that thing away from me.
-Okay, away, away.

16:17.394 --> 16:23.435
Ask Vella if all the priests
died here, why are
there no bones?

16:25.652 --> 16:27.313
Why are there no bones?

16:29.990 --> 16:31.400
( growls )

16:32.367 --> 16:33.823
Okay.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.620
Do you feel that?

16:38.707 --> 16:43.246
Just let the tug of energy tell
you how fast you need to work.

16:43.336 --> 16:49.832
Well, I guess now that
Crichton's back, you'll head
off with him again soon.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.302
Yeah.

16:51.386 --> 16:54.298
I mean, um, perhaps.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.720
I've...

16:56.766 --> 17:00.054
Being here, I've really
enjoyed it.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.477
Yeah?

17:03.273 --> 17:04.604
Yeah.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.898
You know, I think we've really
found something here.

17:06.985 --> 17:10.102
We should clean it up
and show Vella.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.937
And stick it up her nose.

17:12.032 --> 17:13.147
(both laugh)

17:13.241 --> 17:14.572
It's a prayer wheel.

17:14.659 --> 17:17.241
Found on every wall
in the site.

17:17.329 --> 17:19.115
And it would never
fit up my nose.

17:19.206 --> 17:20.696
Yeah, well, I didn't actually
mean that...

17:20.790 --> 17:24.282
Now, why are you using that?

17:24.377 --> 17:25.662
Well, for this...

17:25.754 --> 17:31.124
In unskilled hands, a Carver
can be perilous.

17:31.218 --> 17:36.258
You see, Luxan, the process
that strips away cycles of age,

17:36.348 --> 17:42.935
when it hits living flesh,
absorbs the molecular signature
of whatever it touches.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.307
Thus, that Laka...

17:47.817 --> 17:49.728
is now rock.

17:49.819 --> 17:54.654
Magnetic pulses surrounding the
planet make it impossible for
the Command Carrier to land.

17:54.741 --> 17:58.404
But Marauders with less
sophisticated electronics can
make it through.

17:58.495 --> 18:02.033
How much longer will the dig
site remain habitable?

18:02.123 --> 18:04.375
40 to 50 arns.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.867
Closer.

18:06.962 --> 18:10.204
Well, that's Chief Scientist
Taylik's best estimation, ma'am.

18:10.298 --> 18:13.085
No. You. Closer.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.225
Down.

18:21.309 --> 18:23.174
On your knees.

18:26.064 --> 18:28.305
Are there any other vessels
near the planet?

18:28.400 --> 18:30.311
Just a dead Leviathan in
decayed orbit.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.859
I'm prepping a squadron now.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.696
Closer.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.075
Closer.

18:49.337 --> 18:55.333
Braca, does it bother you what
has happened to Scorpius?

18:56.928 --> 18:58.168
No.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.424
We won't need a squadron.

19:03.518 --> 19:05.304
We'll go to the
planet together.

19:05.395 --> 19:10.264
You and me, three Marauders,
20 soldiers.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.191
Wh-why?

19:19.242 --> 19:23.576
I always assumed John Crichton
was just an outlaw.

19:24.831 --> 19:28.915
An excuse for Scorpius's
mistakes.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.334
But he destroyed a
Command Carrier.

19:31.421 --> 19:32.911
The Scarrans desire him.

19:33.006 --> 19:37.340
Perhaps, somehow,
I can use him.

19:37.427 --> 19:45.425
Perhaps Scorpius's enemy
will be my friend.

19:53.234 --> 19:55.771
Grave robbers leave snares.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.102
(grunts)

19:57.197 --> 20:00.189
This has been opened.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.654
Here.

20:07.248 --> 20:13.039
Make certain you turn your
face away and open it.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.799
Just a primitive Jarnass flash.

20:19.886 --> 20:23.003
Only if it hits your eyes
will it cause damage.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.717
You're brave and listen well.

20:28.812 --> 20:32.100
Do you plan to keep studying
when we leave the dig?

20:32.190 --> 20:33.805
If I'm allowed, yes.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.106
And the Luxan?

20:35.193 --> 20:37.149
He is... he's my friend.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.522
But not your equal!

20:38.613 --> 20:41.150
Intellectually, Luxan's
are a subspecies.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.357
He will make mistakes.

20:43.451 --> 20:46.318
You will be blamed for them.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.327
I know.

21:04.389 --> 21:05.595
Crichton, he's arrested me.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.092
Hands up.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.299
Oh yo, yo, hey. No need for...
no need for guns.

21:09.394 --> 21:11.510
The old lady told me how you
planned to stop us.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.390
Ididn't plan to do anything...

21:13.481 --> 21:14.982
Ah!

21:15.066 --> 21:17.682
He's one of the defilers.
They lie.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.439
They will not use the probes
for good. Kill him!

21:20.530 --> 21:21.895
No.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.948
Vella may not fear you.
But I know you're their leader.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.069
I've heard about you.

21:26.161 --> 21:27.276
Get him, Crichton.

21:27.370 --> 21:30.032
I helped you.
I showed you Aeryn.

21:30.123 --> 21:33.160
You didn't show me squat!
Sit, just sit!

21:33.251 --> 21:34.411
Listen to me...

21:35.378 --> 21:38.666
I don't even know this
old lady's name.

21:38.756 --> 21:42.715
She came on board our ship like
a really bad smell that
won't go away.

21:44.012 --> 21:46.094
I'm not a threat to you.

21:46.181 --> 21:50.265
I just want Moya to come back so
I can get the hell out of here.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.636
That's it.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.974
Except one thing.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.774
Do not point guns at people!

21:59.861 --> 22:01.397
That's right. Hit him again.

22:01.488 --> 22:02.853
No!

22:02.947 --> 22:05.233
Oh, go on, Crichton.
Let me show you. Like this.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.440
And...

22:06.534 --> 22:07.319
(grunts)

22:07.410 --> 22:09.196
See?

22:09.287 --> 22:11.152
What the hell are you doing?

22:11.247 --> 22:15.616
Why are you telling me
to shoot people?
-'Cause you have to.

22:15.710 --> 22:18.292
Vella will take the Darnaz
probes and use them as a weapon.
-No I don't.

22:18.379 --> 22:21.086
Why do you think she sent the
rest of the dig team away?

22:21.174 --> 22:22.209
I have no idea.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.211
There was peace here once.

22:24.302 --> 22:26.008
You must see what was lost here.
-Granny...

22:26.095 --> 22:28.131
I can't let this happen
anywhere else.

22:28.223 --> 22:29.303
(gasps )

22:29.390 --> 22:30.345
Oh!

22:30.433 --> 22:31.593
Damn!

22:31.684 --> 22:32.673
See.

22:32.769 --> 22:36.261
See the ancient world. See.

22:40.860 --> 22:44.102
See what I see.

22:44.197 --> 22:47.155
( priests chanting )

22:59.254 --> 23:02.337
The children's tiles.

23:03.716 --> 23:07.208
The peaceful thread
within us all.

23:08.346 --> 23:11.429
It started here.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.225
See.

23:25.488 --> 23:29.481
See the Darnaz probes.

23:33.454 --> 23:35.706
See it all.

23:43.756 --> 23:47.214
I saw priests...

23:47.302 --> 23:50.044
and a goat...

23:51.306 --> 23:55.515
probes falling from the sky.

23:56.978 --> 24:00.141
I saw where they landed.

24:00.231 --> 24:04.270
Like a wormhole back
to the past.

24:05.194 --> 24:08.561
See. See the peace.

24:11.659 --> 24:15.197
Now sleep.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.620
Sleep, Crichton.

24:25.465 --> 24:29.333
Crichton, wait, wait!
I just had to wake you!

24:33.348 --> 24:36.806
Wait, wait! Crichton, stop!
I'm not going to hurt you!

24:36.893 --> 24:39.635
(gasps )

24:39.729 --> 24:41.185
You scared the hell out of me!

24:41.272 --> 24:46.187
I thought you were a sea
monster, a creature,
critter or something.

24:46.277 --> 24:48.734
What's with this weather?
I must have been out
for a long time.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.322
Not long.

24:50.406 --> 24:51.907
You must stop old woman.

24:51.991 --> 24:55.233
Oh, just lemme... clear the
antifreeze out of my head.

24:55.328 --> 24:58.115
Vella, she has found
the third probe.

24:58.206 --> 24:59.946
It's still under the ground.

25:00.041 --> 25:03.954
Your old lady, she swears
she will kill Vella

25:04.045 --> 25:06.161
so she cannot use it
as a weapon.

25:06.255 --> 25:07.631
No, no, she's just nuts.

25:07.715 --> 25:09.671
She's not gonna do anything.

25:10.885 --> 25:13.297
She... She take your gun?

25:16.432 --> 25:17.683
Granny!

25:19.102 --> 25:23.266
(singing softly)

25:24.399 --> 25:26.731
(grunting)

25:28.403 --> 25:30.189
Oh, who's there?

25:30.279 --> 25:31.189
It's all right.

25:31.280 --> 25:35.023
There's no one here.
No one at all.

25:35.118 --> 25:36.278
Hey.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.659
Hey, what are you doing?

25:40.581 --> 25:42.742
Why didn't you stand up for me?

25:44.127 --> 25:45.537
D'Argo...

25:45.628 --> 25:48.995
most lnterions think
Luxans are inferior.

25:49.090 --> 25:51.297
That's just the way it is.

25:51.384 --> 25:53.340
What do you think?

25:53.428 --> 25:55.293
Don't ask me that.

25:59.267 --> 26:01.428
What do you think?

26:04.814 --> 26:06.896
Ithink...

26:08.234 --> 26:10.725
that you're unusual
for a Luxan.

26:12.155 --> 26:15.443
Yeah. Yeah, I am that.

26:15.533 --> 26:16.739
Sikozu.

26:16.826 --> 26:19.943
Have you finished with
that module?

26:20.288 --> 26:21.869
Sikozu!

26:21.956 --> 26:23.457
Oh...

26:23.541 --> 26:24.997
Shh... shh...

26:25.084 --> 26:28.201
(engine revving up)

26:28.296 --> 26:31.504
(engine roaring)

26:33.551 --> 26:36.634
D'Argo, you can't blame Vella
if she thinks she's smarter
than you.

26:36.721 --> 26:38.177
No, but I can blame you.

26:38.264 --> 26:43.634
I never believed that any of
you cared what I thought.

26:43.728 --> 26:45.184
I care.

26:47.231 --> 26:50.143
And just so you know,

26:50.234 --> 26:54.147
if someone had criticized you,
or insulted you,

26:54.238 --> 26:58.447
called you a stuck-up,
arrogant little princess,

26:58.534 --> 27:00.399
I'd have defended you.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.950
Chrichton:
Granny!

27:09.212 --> 27:11.874
Granny!

27:11.964 --> 27:16.298
Granny, I just want Winona so
I can get the hell out of here.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.341
Receive the spirit.

27:18.429 --> 27:20.260
Receive the spirit.

27:21.474 --> 27:23.089
Granny!

27:30.608 --> 27:31.768
Granny.

27:33.319 --> 27:38.905
Must stop Vella. Not let her
destroy another world.

27:41.786 --> 27:43.777
The Carver.

27:52.296 --> 27:54.332
Have to protect.

27:55.174 --> 28:00.168
(soft singing)

28:00.263 --> 28:02.219
The voices.

28:02.306 --> 28:04.422
The voices say...

28:05.560 --> 28:08.222
don't let them use it.

28:08.312 --> 28:10.428
Don't let them.

28:22.076 --> 28:24.158
Who's there?

28:27.832 --> 28:29.823
Show yourself.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.666
And what are you doing here?

28:34.714 --> 28:36.796
Is this some sort ofjoke?

28:38.676 --> 28:40.166
No!

28:40.261 --> 28:41.717
( explosion )

28:45.850 --> 28:47.260
Grandma?

28:59.614 --> 29:01.445
Oh, boy.

29:03.034 --> 29:04.399
Damn.
-Shh. Shh.

29:04.493 --> 29:05.949
What... what happened here?
-Quiet.

29:06.037 --> 29:07.368
I turned my back for, like,
five minutes, and...

29:07.455 --> 29:09.161
What's is Laura Croft doin'
in the wall?
-Quiet. Quiet!

29:09.248 --> 29:12.740
Tarnat:
Instructor Vella,
are you all right?

29:12.835 --> 29:13.665
We saw...

29:13.753 --> 29:14.959
What are you doing...

29:19.675 --> 29:21.290
Now, don't say a word.

29:21.385 --> 29:24.422
Not a word.

29:25.598 --> 29:30.968
Receive the spirit of
Instructor Vella,

29:31.062 --> 29:36.352
no matter how selfish,
how evil.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.024
( chanting )

29:40.821 --> 29:43.608
D'Argo, you knocked him out.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.657
She's, like, "in" the wall.

29:46.744 --> 29:48.359
What happened to the
rest of her?

29:48.454 --> 29:51.321
She told me that if the Carver
hits living flesh it
alters the DNA.

29:51.415 --> 29:53.030
Nobody cares about the DNA.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.706
Why did you knock that guy out?

29:54.794 --> 29:57.410
If he had seen me with her,
he would have attacked and then
he'd be dead.

29:57.505 --> 29:58.745
I saved his life.

29:58.839 --> 30:00.545
(groaning)

30:01.592 --> 30:05.335
Receive her spirit.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.135
We're still missing one person.

30:07.223 --> 30:09.054
Wrinkles?
-Yeah.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.052
You think she did this?
She can't even take a bath.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.724
She's been acting weird.

30:14.355 --> 30:17.973
If you're planning to escape in
that, I'm going with you.

30:18.067 --> 30:20.809
Does all your species have
truncated spines?

30:20.903 --> 30:23.064
Don't play arky-arky with me.

30:23.155 --> 30:26.272
I promise I'm smarterthan
you'll ever be.

30:26.367 --> 30:31.157
Then you should realize even
with the combustion liquid
I've synthesized,

30:31.247 --> 30:33.659
this module would not travel
for more than an em.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.910
So... no.

30:36.002 --> 30:38.994
I am not trying to
escape in it.

30:39.088 --> 30:41.295
(digital clicking)

30:41.382 --> 30:42.337
What's that?

30:42.425 --> 30:44.165
It's Peacekeeper code.

30:44.260 --> 30:46.376
Three Marauders are heading
to the planet.

30:46.470 --> 30:49.712
That receiver has never picked
up coded transmissions.

30:49.807 --> 30:51.297
I know. I modified it.

30:51.392 --> 30:52.677
Oh.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.349
Go to Pilot's den.

30:54.437 --> 30:57.144
Get that hangar door open.
Then hide in the Neural Cluster.

30:57.231 --> 31:00.223
That will shield your life
signature should the
Peacekeepers scan.

31:00.317 --> 31:01.477
What are you going to do?

31:01.569 --> 31:03.730
I'm going to warn the others
so they can hide.

31:03.821 --> 31:05.311
You're lying.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.692
I told you I would not last
more than an am in this.

31:07.783 --> 31:09.694
Now, get those doors open.

31:09.785 --> 31:12.197
Move!

31:12.288 --> 31:14.119
Then send a secure
comm to Moya.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.323
Stop her from coming until the
Peacekeepers have gone.

31:17.418 --> 31:19.158
You smell Granny?

31:19.253 --> 31:20.459
No.

31:22.298 --> 31:24.209
She's not here.

31:24.300 --> 31:25.380
( sniffs )

31:25.468 --> 31:27.333
Weird.

31:27.428 --> 31:29.464
What?

31:29.555 --> 31:32.092
I've... I've been here.
Déja vu.

31:32.183 --> 31:33.844
This...

31:35.144 --> 31:36.475
There.

31:36.562 --> 31:38.143
How's this thing work?
It's point and click, right?

31:38.230 --> 31:39.185
Keep it away from me.

31:39.273 --> 31:41.935
Hey, it's not a problem.

31:42.026 --> 31:45.234
Under here there's something
that has, I think,
symbols on it.

31:45.321 --> 31:48.028
Most of them alien, one...

31:48.115 --> 31:49.776
maybe I recognize.

31:51.327 --> 31:52.487
Maybe.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.536
How did you know that was here?

31:57.958 --> 31:59.664
Holy crap, it's real.

31:59.752 --> 32:00.832
What is it?

32:00.920 --> 32:02.660
A child's tile.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.245
You know any of these?

32:05.341 --> 32:08.048
This one's Interion.

32:08.135 --> 32:10.512
That one might be
early Sebacean.

32:11.639 --> 32:13.004
Never seen the others.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.259
What do they mean?

32:17.269 --> 32:20.227
The symbol is peace, security.

32:20.314 --> 32:21.599
Peace.

32:21.690 --> 32:23.726
You recognize any
of the symbols?

32:23.818 --> 32:26.400
One... maybe.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.395
Egyptian.

32:29.490 --> 32:31.196
From my homeworld.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.239
Come on, got a change of plan.

32:33.327 --> 32:34.783
Let's go.

32:35.412 --> 32:37.277
Chiana, can you hear me?

32:37.373 --> 32:40.285
Chiana, I'm prepping for a
flyover to see if I can
find the old lady.

32:40.376 --> 32:42.116
Can you hear me?
(alarm pulsing)

32:43.420 --> 32:45.331
Chiana, I'm getting some sort
of proximity alarm.

32:45.422 --> 32:47.083
Can you hear me?

32:47.174 --> 32:48.289
Chiana?!

32:48.384 --> 32:50.170
( hisses )

32:53.264 --> 32:54.424
Do you know what this means?

32:54.515 --> 32:57.302
It means there's a link between
my world and this one.

32:57.393 --> 32:59.258
Somehow they're connected.

33:00.020 --> 33:01.396
Pip...

33:01.480 --> 33:02.936
Peacekeepers.

33:04.525 --> 33:05.810
Peacekeepers.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.900
(grunts)

33:11.365 --> 33:13.651
Chiana, if you can hear me,
I think the ship's...

33:13.742 --> 33:16.609
The Peacekeepers already
have them.

33:16.704 --> 33:19.537
Stop the comms.

33:22.126 --> 33:24.367
We must come up with a plan.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.505
(grunting)

33:37.516 --> 33:40.258
Remember me?

33:40.352 --> 33:41.853
Oh, yeah.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.313
I remember a couple of things.

33:43.397 --> 33:45.479
Tell her to shove it
up tork, Crichton.

33:46.192 --> 33:47.307
(gasps )

33:49.862 --> 33:53.650
I can make things easy for you.

33:53.741 --> 33:56.824
And to prove my goodwill,

33:56.911 --> 33:58.697
Braca?

34:05.211 --> 34:07.623
He'll never bother you again.

34:08.255 --> 34:09.711
Scorpius?

34:11.217 --> 34:13.333
Scorpius...

34:14.261 --> 34:16.252
(grunts)

34:34.573 --> 34:38.065
Do anything you want to him,
anything at all.

34:40.204 --> 34:42.160
(gagging )

34:44.333 --> 34:48.246
No, thanks. I don't think I can
come up with anything better
than that.

34:57.930 --> 34:59.511
What do you want from me?

34:59.598 --> 35:01.589
What I want...

35:02.768 --> 35:06.056
may not be as bad as you think.

35:06.146 --> 35:07.852
You might even like it.

35:19.159 --> 35:21.195
What are you doing?

35:33.299 --> 35:35.255
Crichton, are you...

35:35.342 --> 35:37.082
what are you doing?

35:47.438 --> 35:49.850
Wait an em...

35:51.400 --> 35:53.516
then we'll meet.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.817
Secure the site.

36:09.293 --> 36:10.533
Wake up!

36:10.627 --> 36:12.208
Wake up!

36:13.505 --> 36:14.415
(growling)

36:14.506 --> 36:15.666
( biting )

36:15.758 --> 36:17.498
I'm awake.

36:18.719 --> 36:20.175
What's the matter?

36:20.262 --> 36:22.674
Peacekeepers. We have to get
a secure comm to Moya.

36:22.765 --> 36:25.552
Elack's transmission core
is corrupted.

36:25.642 --> 36:28.258
Everything's dying.
I can't do anything.

36:28.354 --> 36:31.437
Oh. No, no, Pilot.
Stay with me!

36:31.523 --> 36:32.774
Enar... tarnar...

36:32.858 --> 36:34.769
Pilot! Pilot!

36:34.860 --> 36:37.442
I... I'm finished, Dominar.

36:37.529 --> 36:40.942
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
-Please... Pilot.

36:41.033 --> 36:44.196
( muttering )

36:47.956 --> 36:49.742
The orbiting Leviathan
is empty.

36:49.833 --> 36:54.076
At present, we've captured
the Interion, a Nebari
and an old Traskan.

36:54.171 --> 36:56.457
What about the Luxan and
the Peacekeeper traitor?

36:56.548 --> 36:58.413
Uh... nothing.

36:59.551 --> 37:00.927
And this?

37:01.011 --> 37:02.512
The magnetics have spiked.

37:04.348 --> 37:07.260
According to this, we've got
approximately 20 arns left

37:07.351 --> 37:09.467
and under these circumstances,
I think we should leave.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.345
He's regaining motor stimulus.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.942
Change him.

37:22.866 --> 37:24.276
No. No, Braca.

37:27.162 --> 37:30.279
This is for all the times
I've had to say yes.

37:58.402 --> 38:01.144
Good, they're still here.

38:01.238 --> 38:04.401
The two probes are safe.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.119
He found a tile?

38:11.206 --> 38:14.414
Chiana:
Yeah. Th-that he saw
or something

38:14.501 --> 38:16.366
with that powder that you
whacked him with.

38:16.462 --> 38:17.668
A real tile?

38:17.754 --> 38:19.210
Yeah, that's what he said.
From the vision.

38:19.298 --> 38:20.538
Oh, no.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.623
What?

38:22.718 --> 38:23.833
What's the matter?

38:23.927 --> 38:24.916
Chi.

38:25.012 --> 38:26.343
Yeah.

38:26.430 --> 38:30.298
When we first met, did you know
I was on the run?

38:30.392 --> 38:33.350
Accused of stealing from
a Noatian gem mine.

38:33.437 --> 38:35.018
Okay.

38:35.105 --> 38:36.766
We've all gotta cheer up, okay?

38:36.857 --> 38:39.690
Because you are driving me nuts.

38:39.776 --> 38:43.860
I stole things from digs,
but things that I needed.

38:43.947 --> 38:46.859
To study, to learn more,
you understand?

38:46.950 --> 38:48.690
I don't have a problem with
that, Jool.

38:48.785 --> 38:51.652
But I never stole from here.

38:51.747 --> 38:57.333
There is this legend, of this
glorious temple.

38:57.419 --> 39:00.206
Here. That touched the sky.

39:00.297 --> 39:03.585
And no one's ever found
a trace of it.

39:04.801 --> 39:08.168
And I dreamed of
discovering it, and...

39:09.723 --> 39:13.341
now we'll never discover
any of it.
-Thanks for sharing.

39:13.435 --> 39:16.927
No. The priests will help us.

39:18.106 --> 39:21.143
You'll see. You'll see.

39:21.235 --> 39:24.147
I'll get Crichton.

39:24.238 --> 39:25.694
Crichton is nally-whipped.

39:25.781 --> 39:29.399
Give me a distraction and
I'll save us all.

39:30.661 --> 39:32.322
All right.

39:33.747 --> 39:35.203
Okay, Wrinkles.

39:35.290 --> 39:36.200
Follow my lead.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.080
Hey.

39:41.171 --> 39:42.456
Minia.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.960
Hey, uh...

39:45.050 --> 39:47.382
The old lady. She's, uh...

39:47.469 --> 39:49.209
She's got a problem.

39:49.304 --> 39:50.965
Down below.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.763
What do you mean?

39:53.850 --> 39:56.466
She needs to go to the noli.

40:04.403 --> 40:06.485
Okay. Go.

40:46.570 --> 40:49.107
Do you like that?

40:50.282 --> 40:54.195
It's better than what
Scorpius used to do.

40:54.286 --> 40:59.121
Noranti:
Peace can only be maintained
if there is sacrifice.

41:01.043 --> 41:02.203
Peace...

41:04.796 --> 41:06.787
Sacrifice.

41:06.882 --> 41:08.964
Do you like that?

41:10.093 --> 41:11.594
Peace...

41:15.932 --> 41:18.184
Sacrifice...

41:18.268 --> 41:20.475
Whatever you want.

41:20.562 --> 41:22.393
Whatever...

41:23.940 --> 41:25.680
You can have it.

41:29.071 --> 41:34.657
Peace can only be maintained
if there is sacrifice.

41:45.212 --> 41:47.703
Never been real before.

41:49.383 --> 41:51.874
What are you doing here,
old woman?

41:59.726 --> 42:04.311
In the vision I enhanced,
you saw a tile.

42:04.398 --> 42:05.763
A child's tile.

42:05.857 --> 42:08.018
Yeah, just like the
one I found.

42:10.070 --> 42:12.356
What did you do to me?

42:12.447 --> 42:14.278
Must be the magnetics.

42:14.366 --> 42:17.153
Pushes the vision further.

42:17.244 --> 42:20.702
Somehow the suggested
turned real.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.658
Does Grayza know you saw
the Darnaz probes?

42:26.753 --> 42:28.038
No.

42:28.130 --> 42:30.337
Good.

42:30.424 --> 42:34.258
I have seen the carnage weapons
of mass destruction bring.

42:34.344 --> 42:39.429
For Vella to have had one was
awful to consider, but the
Peacekeepers...

42:41.351 --> 42:43.307
They must never have it,
Crichton.

42:45.313 --> 42:47.850
Do you know where the final
probe landed?

42:50.110 --> 42:51.475
Yeah.

42:53.321 --> 42:56.233
This is my fault.

42:56.324 --> 43:01.068
I wanted only to show you the
peace they had achieved.

43:01.163 --> 43:06.578
Somehow I showed you,
what you must not know.

43:12.215 --> 43:13.625
No!

43:17.971 --> 43:20.508
The vision I showed you...

43:20.599 --> 43:22.214
became real.

43:28.857 --> 43:32.349
Grayza can never know where
the final probe is.

43:36.531 --> 43:38.567
You cannot tell her.

43:38.658 --> 43:40.740
You must die.

43:41.536 --> 43:44.369
Oh, forgive me. Forgive me.

43:44.456 --> 43:47.493
No other way. Forgive me.

43:48.543 --> 43:50.204
Walk to the cliff.

43:50.295 --> 43:51.375
To the cliff. Go now.

43:51.463 --> 43:52.543
Forgive me.

43:52.631 --> 43:54.041
Forgive me.

43:54.132 --> 43:55.747
Receive his spirit.

43:55.842 --> 43:57.082
Forgive me.

43:57.177 --> 43:58.713
Forgive me.

43:58.804 --> 44:00.965
Receive the spirit of
John Crichton.

44:02.974 --> 44:04.350
He has to die.

44:04.434 --> 44:06.140
Oh, forgive me.

44:06.228 --> 44:07.468
He has to die.

44:07.562 --> 44:08.847
Has to.

44:35.715 --> 44:37.216
He had to die.

44:38.260 --> 44:40.626
He'll never tell you now.

44:42.264 --> 44:43.754
Never.
