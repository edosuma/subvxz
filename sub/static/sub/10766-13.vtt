00:01.914 --> 00:03.074
Y o, what up, guys?

00:03.148 --> 00:04.580
- Hey, Will.
- Master William.

00:04.650 --> 00:07.050
Aunt Viv, I got the cake
you wanted for the family reunion.

00:07.119 --> 00:09.713
- Good.
- And guess what's in here?

00:09.855 --> 00:12.983
It's round, it's rubber
and you'll never use it.

00:18.830 --> 00:21.492
Carlton, can we please
keep your hand puppet out of this?

00:23.135 --> 00:26.036
Look, it's a California's driver's license.

00:26.238 --> 00:27.967
I think you're confused, Will.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.600
Y ou need a license to drive a car,
not steal one.

00:32.543 --> 00:35.570
I'm sorry, Carlton, I didn't understand you,
I don't speak pygmy.

01:51.023 --> 01:52.456
Diva!

01:53.225 --> 01:55.455
Will, what do you think you're doing?

01:55.527 --> 01:58.018
I'm practicing for when my mom
and all my aunts get here.

01:58.096 --> 02:00.826
I am so excited, Uncle Phil.
Aren't you excited?

02:00.899 --> 02:03.629
No. I hate family reunions.

02:03.869 --> 02:07.327
- I always do all the work.
- Philip, that is not true.

02:09.007 --> 02:11.771
Philip, this is not the kind of juice
Vy drinks...

02:11.843 --> 02:14.812
and Helen does not like this kind of bread.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.713
I guess I will have to take it
back to the store.

02:17.783 --> 02:21.310
- No, no, no, let me do that.
- Great.

02:21.520 --> 02:24.717
Would you pick me up
a gallon of Rocky Road and some sardines.

02:27.259 --> 02:30.251
And don't eat it all on the way home
like you did last time.

02:33.398 --> 02:36.595
- Look who we found.
- Diva!

02:37.569 --> 02:41.699
Helen, oh, God! Let me look at you.

02:41.907 --> 02:44.205
Let me look at it, let me look at it.

02:44.776 --> 02:47.870
- Oh, my God, Frank, how are you?
- I'm fine, how you doing?

02:47.946 --> 02:50.608
Let me look at Frank, Jr.

02:51.683 --> 02:55.676
My goodness, where did you get
those beautiful green eyes?

02:58.190 --> 03:00.784
I'm guessing, the guy with no rhythm.

03:02.527 --> 03:04.188
Y ou mean Carlton?

03:07.933 --> 03:09.628
Diva!

03:15.774 --> 03:18.607
Whoa, whoa, think you could all
come together next time?

03:18.677 --> 03:21.612
- This is exhausting.
- Let me look at you all.

03:21.680 --> 03:24.376
- Vivian, girl, you are glowing.
- Thank you.

03:24.449 --> 03:28.010
That's 'cause she be spending
a lot of time in front of the microwave.

03:28.487 --> 03:29.613
Philip, that reminds me.

03:29.688 --> 03:31.815
Would you pick me up some
microwave popcorn, please?

03:31.890 --> 03:34.484
Y ou know, next time
I'm going to get pregnant.

03:34.893 --> 03:37.760
Well, you certainly have the pants for it.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.302
Uncle Phil, if I would have said that
I would have gotten smacked in my head.

03:49.374 --> 03:51.433
Look at Little Frank.

03:52.577 --> 03:56.673
Now that's the first time
a man has smiled at me since my divorce.

03:57.182 --> 03:59.173
Aunt Helen, I just want to say
how sorry I am...

03:59.251 --> 04:01.617
things didn't work out
between you and Uncle Lester.

04:01.686 --> 04:02.846
Thank you, sweetheart.

04:02.921 --> 04:05.947
Do you think he'll still be sending me
a gift for graduation?

04:06.324 --> 04:08.315
How has he been acting since the divorce?

04:08.393 --> 04:10.953
Awful. I hate that man.

04:11.296 --> 04:14.322
But I don't like to badmouth him
without the kid around.

04:14.399 --> 04:16.697
Y ou know, it's like doing the work twice.

04:19.036 --> 04:22.473
Where's Vy? Now, she said
she has some really big news.

04:22.541 --> 04:24.372
Y ou know, she told me the same thing.

04:24.442 --> 04:28.208
Isn't it obvious? Really big news?

04:28.280 --> 04:31.215
She must be bringing me
Grandma's diamond earrings.

04:32.584 --> 04:35.348
I don't think so. Do you like them?

04:37.856 --> 04:40.882
Aunt Janice, I never got to know Grandma.

04:40.959 --> 04:42.984
I'd really like to have something of hers.

04:43.061 --> 04:46.588
Listen, honey, I have a beautiful
silk handkerchief of Grandma's.

04:46.665 --> 04:49.429
Y eah, like I really want
some old lady's snot rag.

04:52.270 --> 04:54.170
Well, she said
it was something about Robert.

04:54.239 --> 04:57.106
Now, ladies, this could be
an engagement announcement.

04:57.209 --> 04:59.837
- Y ou know it could...
- Come on!

04:59.911 --> 05:04.177
No! Maybe the big news
is something else.

05:04.716 --> 05:06.513
Maybe she got cable.

05:08.353 --> 05:09.650
Divas!

05:17.495 --> 05:19.827
- Big Diva.
- Y eah.

05:20.332 --> 05:24.496
Mom, it's a terrible idea marrying
this Robert dude, it's a big mistake.

05:24.569 --> 05:27.970
Baby, I'm not marrying Robert,
we broke up.

05:29.007 --> 05:30.804
- Vy, now come...
- That's the big news.

05:30.876 --> 05:33.344
- My goodness.
- Y es. All right.

05:34.512 --> 05:36.241
- Honey, what happened, tell us.
- Y eah.

05:36.314 --> 05:38.179
He just wanted more
out of the relationship...

05:38.250 --> 05:40.775
and I wasn't sure I could spend
the rest of my life with him.

05:40.852 --> 05:42.217
Amen.

05:42.921 --> 05:46.379
- And, Will's never been too fond of him.
- No, Will was not.

05:46.458 --> 05:48.619
So, in the long run
it seemed like the best thing.

05:48.693 --> 05:49.785
Well...

05:51.162 --> 05:53.392
Hey, you know, Vy,
I have a brother who's single.

05:53.465 --> 05:55.695
Although, he's not a brother.
I mean he is a brother...

05:55.767 --> 05:58.702
because he's my brother,
but he's just not your kind of brother.

06:00.872 --> 06:02.271
Oh, brother.

06:04.209 --> 06:05.608
Help me, Will.

06:05.677 --> 06:08.976
No, I think I'm going to stick
with the black folks on this one.

06:16.488 --> 06:19.855
- I love you so much, Mom.
- I love you, too, sweetie.

06:20.358 --> 06:24.226
Y ou know, it's great having you out here.
<i>E</i> specially without that Robert dude.

06:24.296 --> 06:28.164
Getting all in our hair.
Trying like a damn fool to win me over.

06:28.233 --> 06:29.564
Y ou're not kidding, baby.

06:29.634 --> 06:33.126
Y ou know, for your graduation,
he actually wanted to buy you a car.

06:37.876 --> 06:40.037
- A car?
- Y eah.

06:41.546 --> 06:44.037
I'm glad you dumped him anyway, Ma.

06:45.917 --> 06:48.715
What kind of car
he want to get me, Mom?

06:50.522 --> 06:54.014
Okay, set everything on the island.
We'll use it tomorrow to serve.

06:55.560 --> 06:59.553
Let me take that, Vivian,
wouldn't want you to overexert yourself.

06:59.631 --> 07:01.462
Philip, are you upset with me?

07:01.533 --> 07:03.967
Vivian, for the past 48 hours,
all I've heard is:

07:04.035 --> 07:05.832
"Philip, wash this. Philip, dust that.

07:05.904 --> 07:08.464
"Philip, push me up the steps,
I'm pregnant."

07:09.107 --> 07:11.302
As long as you're not upset with me.

07:13.912 --> 07:18.144
Sir, when she's not looking,
break one of her crystal figurines.

07:18.216 --> 07:20.275
It'll work wonders for your attitude.

07:25.924 --> 07:26.982
Y es!

07:28.860 --> 07:30.521
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi, girl.

07:30.595 --> 07:34.087
- Y ou guys missed a great afternoon.
- So did you.

07:34.165 --> 07:38.158
- We were down at the news station.
- We got to polish the silver.

07:39.804 --> 07:43.570
Let me tell you, Hilary's the best
weather girl I've ever seen.

07:43.742 --> 07:48.372
Oh, yes. She's beautiful. She's poised.
She's articulate.

07:48.446 --> 07:51.904
God, I'm really enjoying all of this,
but please stop.

07:53.952 --> 07:55.214
Okay.

07:57.155 --> 08:00.090
Frank, honey, I think it's time to change
Frank, Jr.

08:00.158 --> 08:01.523
Okay, babe.

08:01.993 --> 08:04.826
Y ou know what, you look a little tired.
Why don't you come and lay down...

08:04.896 --> 08:07.797
- and I'll rub your feet for a little while.
- Thanks, baby.

08:10.769 --> 08:13.567
That does it, I'm getting me a white man.

08:18.543 --> 08:19.908
Girl, stop it.

08:19.978 --> 08:23.072
No, just to help
around the house a little bit.

08:23.314 --> 08:26.408
Now, come on,
you know you all were thinking it.

08:28.753 --> 08:31.813
I'm never driving in a car
with Uncle Lou and Aunt <i>E</i> leanor again.

08:31.890 --> 08:34.051
- Honey, what happened?
- They were blasting the radio...

08:34.125 --> 08:36.889
sticking their heads through the sunroof,
and yelling at other cars.

08:36.961 --> 08:38.895
When they weren't doing that,
they were making out.

08:38.962 --> 08:41.488
I mean, when are those two
going to grow up?

08:42.200 --> 08:43.724
Honey, stop it.

08:46.704 --> 08:48.137
Aunt <i>E</i> leanor.

08:48.206 --> 08:51.972
- Hey, get your own girl.
- Aunt <i>E</i> leanor.

08:52.043 --> 08:55.069
- Hi, Uncle Lou.
- Hi.

08:55.947 --> 08:57.972
Look at you two.

08:58.049 --> 09:01.985
- Gosh, you look like a couple of kids.
- Y ou look like a couple of kids yourself.

09:03.521 --> 09:06.354
Y ou all got to remember,
she carrying Uncle Phil's child.

09:08.726 --> 09:11.286
Lou, I want to go up and freshen up.

09:12.330 --> 09:15.424
Me, too. See you all tomorrow.

09:21.005 --> 09:23.997
Now, what does Aunt <i>E</i> leanor have
that I don't?

09:24.175 --> 09:25.802
A horny husband.

09:28.746 --> 09:32.204
This is just so great,
my whole family under one roof.

09:32.717 --> 09:35.948
Y ou know, I just wish that we could
all be together all the time.

09:36.020 --> 09:39.751
Baby, at least you and I
are going to be together in a few months.

09:40.058 --> 09:42.049
Get the... y ou moving to L. A?

09:42.127 --> 09:44.789
No, silly, I'm talking about
when you graduate high school...

09:44.863 --> 09:46.490
and move back home.

09:46.698 --> 09:50.259
It'll be just like old times, baby,
just you and me.

09:50.335 --> 09:53.634
We can do everything together.
I can hardly wait.

09:54.005 --> 09:56.667
I've looked forward to this for so long.

09:56.841 --> 09:59.071
<i>And /'ve got so many things p/anned.</i>

10:17.028 --> 10:19.861
Hi, baby. I came to tuck you in.

10:21.432 --> 10:23.593
- Here you go.
- Thanks a lot, Mom.

10:25.203 --> 10:27.068
Can we talk about me
moving back home?

10:27.138 --> 10:28.901
Y ou're excited, too, huh?

10:29.607 --> 10:32.940
- Look, now that you mention it, Mom...
- Baby, I got your room fixed up so nice.

10:33.011 --> 10:35.605
And keep your fingers crossed
because I got a friend at U of P...

10:35.680 --> 10:38.581
who thinks she might be able
to pull some strings with your application.

10:38.650 --> 10:42.711
Heck, with me working around the corner,
we could have lunch together every day.

10:44.122 --> 10:45.453
<i>E</i> very day.

10:46.591 --> 10:49.958
I'll tell you, baby, these past few days
with you have been so great...

10:50.028 --> 10:53.020
- I haven't thought about Robert once.
- Really?

10:53.565 --> 10:56.261
'Cause, yo,
I've been thinking about him all the time.

10:57.435 --> 11:01.132
Y ou just get some rest,
and we'll talk some more tomorrow.

11:18.389 --> 11:20.084
I'll get it!

11:31.069 --> 11:32.593
Hey, Al!

11:38.376 --> 11:42.176
- How you doing, Mr. Smith?
- Hey, call me Will, man.

11:43.581 --> 11:46.345
What you say, you take me down
to one of them dance clubs...

11:46.417 --> 11:48.180
you all be going to.

11:52.323 --> 11:55.019
- <i>E</i> xcuse me?
- Never mind, boy, I thought you was hip.

11:55.093 --> 11:56.924
Get on out of my house.

12:01.032 --> 12:04.468
Hey, girl.
How you doing with your fine self?

12:04.769 --> 12:09.103
Why don't you slide on up here
and let Big Daddy talk to you a little bit!

12:10.174 --> 12:11.869
- Y ou like that?
- Who's that out there, baby?

12:11.943 --> 12:15.401
- It ain't nobody, Mama.
- Get your big old butt back in here then.

12:16.814 --> 12:18.372
- Look here, Mom.
- What's that?

12:18.449 --> 12:20.314
A letter from Carlton.

12:22.020 --> 12:25.217
- And the boy sent a picture.
- Look at that, he look great.

12:25.623 --> 12:26.885
And he's so tall.

12:26.958 --> 12:29.119
Lord, who'd of thought
he'd shoot up 12 inches...

12:29.193 --> 12:30.990
in his freshman year.

12:35.767 --> 12:39.726
"Dear Will, and Aunt Vy...

12:39.804 --> 12:44.104
"enjoying a relaxing vacation
with Miriah and the kids.

12:44.809 --> 12:47.869
"It's great to be rich, hah, hah.

12:48.079 --> 12:49.637
"Love, Carlton.

12:49.714 --> 12:52.547
"P.S. It's really, really great to be rich.

12:52.984 --> 12:54.349
"Hah, hah."

12:55.219 --> 12:57.744
Isn't it nice to hear from Carlton?

12:57.989 --> 13:01.481
Baby, why ain't you got on
that leisure suit I laid out for you?

13:03.027 --> 13:06.724
Because I'm a 72-year-old man
still living with his mother.

13:07.398 --> 13:09.593
And I'm tired of it, Mom.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.897
I mean, I want to get married.

13:12.470 --> 13:14.199
And I want to have some kids.

13:14.772 --> 13:18.173
And I don't want nobody telling me
what to wear.

13:18.509 --> 13:21.307
I'm sorry. Y ou the man, you the man.

13:21.879 --> 13:25.940
- About time I start treating you like one.
- Y ou've got that right.

13:27.719 --> 13:30.210
Can I have $10 to go to the movies?

13:31.122 --> 13:32.487
Sure, baby.

13:34.559 --> 13:35.958
Here you go.

13:36.060 --> 13:38.585
Another dollar for some Gummy Bears.

13:39.364 --> 13:41.457
Y ou taking anybody special?

13:41.833 --> 13:43.391
Harriet Jenkins.

13:44.435 --> 13:48.064
Y ou're spending my social security
on Harriet Jenkins.

13:48.673 --> 13:51.403
Look, Mama, I'm going to tell you,
if you mess this date up for me...

13:51.476 --> 13:52.909
- I'm moving out of here.
- Okay.

13:52.977 --> 13:54.501
- I Swear.
- Okay.

13:55.713 --> 13:57.908
Y ou know, I was looking
in the paper the other day...

13:57.982 --> 14:00.007
and I saw Robert's picture.

14:00.084 --> 14:02.279
Oh, Lord, here come Robert again.

14:02.887 --> 14:06.084
Y ou remember him, don't you,
the man that proposed to me?

14:06.157 --> 14:07.556
I remember.

14:08.292 --> 14:10.487
- His wife dead yet?
- No.

14:10.962 --> 14:14.227
Damn, got to use
more dynamite next time.

14:15.299 --> 14:19.065
Lord know, he a rich man. Handsome, too.

14:19.937 --> 14:22.701
<i>E</i> ven hear he giving money to the church.

14:23.207 --> 14:24.868
But I tell you one thing, baby...

14:24.942 --> 14:29.106
I sure am glad
that you talked me out of marrying him.

14:32.417 --> 14:36.217
Okay, Ma, you win.
I'll cancel my date with Harriet.

14:36.788 --> 14:40.849
Baby, you ain't got to do that.
Y ou just put on that leisure suit.

14:40.958 --> 14:42.653
I'll call Harriet.

14:52.437 --> 14:55.565
I'm still half asleep,
so don't nobody talk to me.

14:55.673 --> 14:59.575
- Did the baby wake you up?
- <i>E</i> leanor and Lou woke me up.

15:00.778 --> 15:03.645
I swear that man's part jackhammer.

15:07.051 --> 15:09.815
Lord, they didn't even eat this much
at the Last Supper.

15:10.254 --> 15:12.882
Well, I guess
you old enough to remember.

15:16.527 --> 15:19.428
Y eah, but I'm still young enough
to kick your butt.

15:21.933 --> 15:25.460
- What are you all doing up?
- <i>E</i> ating and talking about sex.

15:25.670 --> 15:27.900
Personally, I prefer eating.

15:27.972 --> 15:30.338
Y ou don't have to wait an hour
for seconds.

15:33.077 --> 15:34.408
All right!

15:35.980 --> 15:39.882
Well, Vy, tell me, what's the real deal
between you and Robert?

15:40.485 --> 15:43.648
- I wasn't in love with him.
- Girl, are you crazy?

15:43.855 --> 15:47.052
That man had a business,
a car and money.

15:47.458 --> 15:49.949
Now, what's love got to do with it?

15:50.661 --> 15:54.358
Can we just for once have a conversation
without my name being mentioned?

15:54.799 --> 15:55.891
Sure, Vy.

15:55.967 --> 16:00.461
Why is a certain person ruining Will's life
by moving him back to Philly?

16:01.606 --> 16:05.042
Why doesn't a certain person
stick a drumstick in her mouth...

16:05.109 --> 16:06.667
and call it a day?

16:06.744 --> 16:08.769
Wait a minute, now, Vy.

16:08.846 --> 16:11.838
We all family here
and we all care about Will.

16:12.116 --> 16:14.448
Listen, do I tell you how to raise your son?

16:14.519 --> 16:16.510
No, but I wish you would.

16:18.389 --> 16:22.951
Vy, I really think Will had his heart set
on going to school in California.

16:23.861 --> 16:25.522
So this is how it is?

16:25.596 --> 16:29.123
Once again my family
has taken it upon themselves...

16:29.233 --> 16:31.565
to decide that Vy don't know
how to take care of her own.

16:32.870 --> 16:34.838
No, you're wrong. Y ou're wrong.

16:34.906 --> 16:39.002
And I'll thank all of you to keep your noses
out of my personal affairs.

16:45.816 --> 16:49.479
Okay, everybody, who's going
to bless this table? Come on, you all.

16:49.554 --> 16:51.784
I think it ought to be the oldest, Vy.

16:51.856 --> 16:54.256
I am not the oldest, Uncle Lou is.

16:54.325 --> 16:55.952
He's young to me.

16:58.095 --> 17:01.030
- Lou!
- Y es, yes, okay, okay.

17:01.499 --> 17:02.966
All right.

17:03.668 --> 17:06.603
Dear Lord, we thank you...

17:07.038 --> 17:09.006
for bringing our family together.

17:09.507 --> 17:11.599
Keep us safe and healthy...

17:12.009 --> 17:14.500
so that we can come together again.

17:15.413 --> 17:20.281
And, we thank Philip and Vivian
for their hospitality...

17:20.785 --> 17:23.481
- and their Jacuzzi.
- Amen.

17:27.023 --> 17:29.618
<i>E</i> njoying the reunion, Master William?

17:31.729 --> 17:33.629
I don't know what to do, G. I mean...

17:34.031 --> 17:37.990
I don't want to move back to Philly,
but I don't want to let my mom down.

17:38.202 --> 17:39.601
But then on the other hand, it's like...

17:39.670 --> 17:44.403
I'm so terribly sorry, Master William,
there's been a misunderstanding.

17:44.642 --> 17:49.341
Apparently, I gave you the impression
that I really wanted to know.

17:54.051 --> 17:56.485
Where did Uncle Lou and Aunt <i>E</i> leanor
disappear to?

17:56.721 --> 18:00.521
Oh, my God, are they at it again?
Those two are animals.

18:04.328 --> 18:08.856
I was in the bathroom.
Get your minds out the gutter.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.502
What?

18:24.081 --> 18:26.242
Now, Will,
about your moving back to Philly.

18:26.317 --> 18:29.650
Y eah, I know,
the sheets and bed linens stay here.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.955
No, well, yeah.

18:32.023 --> 18:33.820
No, what I was going to say was
I hope that...

18:33.891 --> 18:36.086
money wasn't a part of your decision...

18:36.160 --> 18:38.958
because I'd be more than happy
to help you with your tuition.

18:39.797 --> 18:41.355
Thanks a lot, Uncle Phil but...

18:41.432 --> 18:43.730
I need to be in Philly,
you know, with my mom.

18:44.035 --> 18:47.493
Whatever you decide, I just want you
to know that I'm behind you 100o/o.

18:47.638 --> 18:49.435
Thanks and it means a lot to me,
Uncle Phil.

18:49.507 --> 18:51.099
Good. Okay, son.

18:52.109 --> 18:54.236
Okay, Vivian, I told him
everything you wanted me to...

18:54.311 --> 18:56.438
now give me my piece of pie.

18:57.982 --> 18:59.415
- Baby.
- Hey, what's up, Mom?

18:59.483 --> 19:01.542
- I have a little surprise for you.
- Y eah?

19:01.619 --> 19:03.416
Y es, I got a great deal on a cruise...

19:03.487 --> 19:06.547
and I am sending you
to the Caribbean for your graduation.

19:06.957 --> 19:08.219
- For real?
- Y es.

19:08.292 --> 19:10.260
I always wanted to go to the Caribbean.

19:14.532 --> 19:15.965
It'll be so great, baby.

19:16.033 --> 19:18.968
We could go snorkeling
and play shuffleboard.

19:21.105 --> 19:23.505
We? Y ou going, too?

19:23.574 --> 19:26.065
Well, sure, and it's not locked in yet...

19:26.143 --> 19:29.977
but I think the entertainment
is going to be the new Fifth Dimension.

19:31.582 --> 19:34.608
I love them, take me. Take me.

19:36.487 --> 19:38.955
- Shut up, Carlton.
- Oh, yeah?

19:40.024 --> 19:42.492
Well, you smell like broccoli.

19:45.863 --> 19:48.388
- What's the matter?
- Ma, this is great.

19:49.133 --> 19:50.930
We need to talk and...

19:51.135 --> 19:54.070
Look, it can't wait.
We got to talk about this right now.

19:55.740 --> 19:57.799
Well, I hate to say I told you so.

19:57.875 --> 20:00.469
I know what you all are thinking.
But you're wrong.

20:00.544 --> 20:02.705
Now, Will is looking forward to moving
back to Philly.

20:02.780 --> 20:04.441
Aren't you, baby?

20:08.652 --> 20:11.052
Look what the wind did to my hat.

20:12.556 --> 20:15.252
Ma, can you help me go find it, please?

20:16.160 --> 20:19.687
- Will, what's going on?
- Look, Mom, it's...

20:21.665 --> 20:23.223
We were just...

20:23.801 --> 20:27.999
- Somebody should fix this light here.
- Y eah, there's some things broken.

20:28.072 --> 20:30.336
The light, yeah.

20:34.245 --> 20:36.736
Walk with me, talk with me, Mom.

20:38.082 --> 20:40.550
- All right, look, check it out.
- Spit it out.

20:41.051 --> 20:45.112
- All right, see, I was...
- Baby, whatever it is, I will understand.

20:45.356 --> 20:49.019
I know, you'll understand and I'll be
on my way to the emergency room.

20:49.093 --> 20:50.754
Will, just say it.

20:52.863 --> 20:56.594
- Mom, I don't want to move back home.
- How can you say that?

20:56.734 --> 21:00.727
Baby, when I sent you out here,
it was only on a temporary basis.

21:00.871 --> 21:03.635
I always expected you to come back home.

21:04.141 --> 21:05.665
So did I, Mom.

21:06.043 --> 21:08.739
And, I know I was tripping
when I first came out here...

21:08.813 --> 21:11.145
'cause you were right,
I needed to be out here.

21:11.282 --> 21:13.113
And I still need to be out here.

21:13.184 --> 21:16.847
Y ou know, it's given me a head start
so I can break out on my own.

21:16.921 --> 21:18.684
What about college?

21:18.789 --> 21:22.190
Y ou know I can't afford
to send you to an out-of-state school.

21:22.326 --> 21:25.420
I know, Ma, but, look,
I was hoping I could get a scholarship...

21:25.496 --> 21:29.398
or a loan, and Uncle Phil said he'd help me.
And, if that doesn't work, I'll get a job...

21:29.466 --> 21:32.697
I'll get two jobs, but please,
don't make me move back home, Mommy.

21:33.170 --> 21:35.764
Obviously, you've given this
a lot of thought, huh?

21:36.373 --> 21:40.002
But I'll be honest with you,
I still want you to come home.

21:40.077 --> 21:43.979
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too, Mom.

21:44.782 --> 21:48.013
Look, but I'll visit. <i>E</i> very Christmas.

21:49.453 --> 21:51.080
And every <i>E</i> aster.

21:51.922 --> 21:53.719
And whatever else of them holidays...

21:53.791 --> 21:56.919
it'd take to get that evil look
out your face.

21:58.662 --> 22:01.529
Well, it sounds like
you made up your mind.

22:01.899 --> 22:04.800
So I guess I have to respect your decision.

22:05.302 --> 22:07.202
Y ou do? I mean, you do!

22:11.775 --> 22:15.302
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you, too, baby.

22:17.748 --> 22:22.515
As much as I hate to admit it,
your aunts were right and I was wrong.

22:22.586 --> 22:25.077
But don't you dare tell them, you hear me?

22:32.563 --> 22:35.396
- Someone should fix this light here.
- Y eah.

22:36.333 --> 22:38.233
Someone should fix this light.

22:39.136 --> 22:41.263
Y our secret's safe with me.

22:48.145 --> 22:52.946
Sir, when she's not looking,
break one of her crystal fusiliers.

22:56.687 --> 22:59.178
Do you know what a fusilier is?

23:03.527 --> 23:06.052
A fusilier, a crystal fusilier.

23:08.065 --> 23:09.828
<i>They must got them in London.</i>
