<i>Sue:
No, Rachel, I'm sorry.</i>

00:19.249 --> 00:21.117
But the VP's schedule
has skyrocketed

00:21.151 --> 00:22.384
since the interview.

00:22.419 --> 00:23.919
Actually, I'm not sorry.

00:23.953 --> 00:25.487
I'm not sure why
I just said that.

00:25.521 --> 00:26.988
Boy, I'll tell you something.

00:27.022 --> 00:30.224
That TV interview was a big
gamble, but it really paid off.

00:30.259 --> 00:31.960
- Look at this.
- What is it?

00:31.994 --> 00:34.194
They're calling you
the "no-BS VP."

00:34.229 --> 00:36.063
Damn right they are.

00:36.097 --> 00:37.430
I mean, I lied and everything,

00:37.465 --> 00:39.566
- but it sounded true, at least.
- Uh-huh.

00:39.600 --> 00:40.933
Dan:
Mood is good.

00:40.968 --> 00:42.801
Just need six more
years like today

00:42.836 --> 00:44.169
and they will vote us POTUS.

00:44.204 --> 00:45.337
Hey, ma'am, remember tomorrow

00:45.372 --> 00:47.072
you've got that
Get Moving Fun Run.

00:47.107 --> 00:49.308
You probably should prepare,
don't you think?

00:49.342 --> 00:51.076
- It's a 10K.
- Yeah.

00:51.110 --> 00:53.478
- I can run that thing in a suit of armor.
- Okay.

00:53.513 --> 00:55.580
Ma'am, I shouldn't go with
you to this donors' brunch.

00:55.614 --> 00:57.682
We don't want to set off
any alarm bells.

00:57.717 --> 00:59.451
Oh, yeah. You know what?
Me neither.

00:59.485 --> 01:03.155
Okay, I'll go kiss some hateful
billionaire ass on my own.

01:03.189 --> 01:04.657
Give them all donor boners.

01:04.691 --> 01:06.792
- Everyone wants a piece of you, ma'am.
- Yeah.

01:06.827 --> 01:07.693
- ( Phone ringing )
- Via me.

01:07.728 --> 01:09.562
I need to go talk
to Ben right now.

01:09.596 --> 01:12.632
<i>- Andale!
- Let's go.</i>

01:12.666 --> 01:15.067
<i>Anchorman: We haven't heard anything

01:17.104 --> 01:19.272
<i>high up
in the State Department.</i>

01:20.174 --> 01:21.474
What?
What are you doing?

01:21.508 --> 01:23.409
- I don't want people to see that.
- Okay.

01:24.611 --> 01:26.345
They should put those
in a dispenser

01:26.379 --> 01:27.713
- outside Ben's office, right?
- Yeah.

01:27.747 --> 01:29.748
<i>Anchorman: White House
staff are lawyering up</i>

01:29.783 --> 01:30.916

01:30.950 --> 01:32.718
Ben.

01:32.752 --> 01:34.619
<i>- Ben?
- We've got the president's own party</i>

01:34.654 --> 01:36.654
<i>talking of
a potential challenger...</i>

01:36.689 --> 01:39.224
Hey, why doesn't POTUS
just make an apology?

01:39.258 --> 01:41.960
I mean, I did and I was only,
like, suicidal for a week.

01:41.995 --> 01:45.396
- Huh?
- Because he's a mess, all right?

01:45.431 --> 01:48.066
He's got a cave
full of bats in his skull.

01:48.100 --> 01:50.034
I took the heat for the spy.

01:50.068 --> 01:53.170
<i>- Don't I get any credit for that at all?
- Yeah.</i>

01:53.205 --> 01:56.006
So now we've got the House
Judiciary Committee

01:56.041 --> 01:58.041
<i>subpoenaing us senseless.</i>

01:58.076 --> 02:01.077
And on top of that,
we got a rumor going around

02:01.111 --> 02:04.412
that says that there's
a challenger inside the party.

02:04.446 --> 02:06.747
- What? Who?
- I don't know.

02:06.781 --> 02:09.547
<i>One of Gaddafi's sons.
They're polling better.</i>

02:09.580 --> 02:11.182
So thank you very much
for your help,

02:11.216 --> 02:13.417
but would you quit being
so goddamned proactive?

02:13.451 --> 02:15.319
<i>What are you going
to do for an encore?</i>

02:15.386 --> 02:17.587
Blow the opening day pitch
out of your ass?

02:17.621 --> 02:19.055
Ah, that's lovely.

02:19.089 --> 02:21.924
Is this what this is going to
be like for the next two years?

02:21.958 --> 02:23.125
Oh, my, yes.

02:23.159 --> 02:25.561
We are at DEFCON fuck.

Gary: Hey, ma'am, I got
flash cards on the donors.

02:31.166 --> 02:32.199
No, thanks.
I got it.

Sandra O'Neill
fricking hates fracking,

02:36.537 --> 02:38.271
Sidney Purcell...
talking to him,

02:38.306 --> 02:41.674
it's like being stuck in a sewer
pipe filled with dead rats.

02:41.709 --> 02:43.242
He's got money to burn.

02:43.277 --> 02:45.811
Not that donating to your
campaign is burning money.

02:45.845 --> 02:47.312
I know what this is all about.

02:47.346 --> 02:49.747
This is a political
prick tease today.

02:49.782 --> 02:51.783
Yeah, and we're about
to meet a bunch of pricks.

02:51.817 --> 02:54.118
<i>Yeah.
Challenger schmallenger.</i>

02:54.152 --> 02:55.652
I mean, if this
brunch goes well,

02:55.687 --> 02:57.788
my campaign launchpad
is going to be made

02:57.822 --> 03:00.323
of solid fucking gold.

03:00.391 --> 03:01.624
( Laughs )

03:01.658 --> 03:06.060
And then in six years,
it's gonna be Ms. President.

03:06.095 --> 03:07.795
- ( Men laugh )
- Yeah!

03:07.830 --> 03:09.664
We're gonna need a bigger bag!

03:09.698 --> 03:11.832
Ovaries in the Oval Office!

03:11.867 --> 03:14.368
The West Womb!

03:14.402 --> 03:15.869
What?

03:15.904 --> 03:17.504
- What?
- You know, like a womb.

03:17.538 --> 03:20.146
Like a woman has a womb
that the baby comes...

03:20.299 --> 03:22.775
Oh, pathetic. "Politico" is announcing
that Danny Chung

03:22.809 --> 03:26.144
has just uploaded his "What I'm
Listening To" playlist on Spotify.

03:26.179 --> 03:27.946
Hmm. We need
to do a playlist.

03:27.980 --> 03:30.214
<i>- No, we don't.
- Selina: Oh, we absolutely do.</i>

03:30.248 --> 03:32.550
- Get Dan.
- No, I can help with the songs.

03:32.584 --> 03:34.585
You know, my niece
loves Katy Perry.

03:34.619 --> 03:35.919
Just like I said, get Dan.

03:35.954 --> 03:37.387
<i>( Music playing )</i>

03:37.422 --> 03:39.623
- There he is.
- DJ Dan.

03:39.657 --> 03:41.391
- Thanks for the playlist.
- Oh, my pleasure.

03:41.425 --> 03:42.658
Seems like it's playing
pretty well, too,

03:42.693 --> 03:44.727
with the oldies
and the Young Chungers.

03:44.761 --> 03:46.228
The Young Chungers.

03:46.262 --> 03:48.363
- It's like you think in hashtags.
- Oh, you like that?

03:48.397 --> 03:50.298
All right, maybe we can call

03:50.332 --> 03:53.100
the over 65ers
the Granny Chungs.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.302
Something.
No, I'll keep working on that one.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.604
- ( Cell phone ringing )
- Oh, shit.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.505
You need to take that.
Keep her happy.

03:59.539 --> 04:00.506
Tall order.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.574
You smell that?
Money.

04:02.608 --> 04:04.042
- ( Men laugh )
- Hey, Dan?

04:04.076 --> 04:06.009
<i>- Ma'am.
- Have you heard anything about</i>

04:06.044 --> 04:07.244
this Danny Chung playlist?

04:07.278 --> 04:08.111
<i>I just caught that, actually.</i>

04:08.145 --> 04:09.679
Some smart stuff on there, too.

04:09.713 --> 04:11.113
Nas for the young folks,

04:11.148 --> 04:12.448
some Dean Martin
for the retirees.

04:12.482 --> 04:15.150
He just got one of his
butt droids to do it,

04:15.185 --> 04:18.185
which is why I want you
to do it for me, okay?

04:18.220 --> 04:20.220
Your mix is my command.

04:20.255 --> 04:22.723
Come on, Sue, help me out with this, okay?
You're good at this stuff.

04:22.757 --> 04:24.691
You're young, you're
hip, you're hop.

04:24.725 --> 04:26.192
What about Jimmy Cliff?
"The Harder They Come"?

04:26.260 --> 04:27.227
No.

04:27.261 --> 04:29.395
Look, I have no idea
who that is, so, no.

04:29.430 --> 04:31.831
Elvis Costello, "Peace,
Love and Understanding"?

04:31.865 --> 04:33.533
- What?
- No, no, and no.

04:33.567 --> 04:35.234
Are you getting these
all from your iPod?

04:35.269 --> 04:38.070
- No. I think it's in a cloud.
- Oh.

04:38.105 --> 04:39.705
You know, do you think
that Danny Chung's

04:39.740 --> 04:42.474
the one who's getting ready
to bust a move in two years?

04:42.509 --> 04:43.809
Well, the way POTUS is going,

04:43.843 --> 04:46.045
he'll probably stumble
into a war sooner or later.

04:46.079 --> 04:48.280
Chung will reenlist and
hopefully get himself killed.

04:48.314 --> 04:51.349
I don't understand why I don't get the
same respect as he does, you know?

04:51.383 --> 04:54.452
- Shit!
- Oh, what about that? "Respect."

04:54.486 --> 04:56.487
<i>- Sue?
- You know, the Aretha Franklin song?</i>

04:56.521 --> 04:57.755
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:57.789 --> 05:00.157
- That would be great.
- Hey, Mike. Mike.

05:00.191 --> 05:01.991
- Ooh!
- Gary: Oh, my God.

05:02.026 --> 05:03.659
Duchess is down. Duchess is down.
Yellow, yellow.

05:03.693 --> 05:05.961
<i>- I repeat, Duchess is down. Go, Rick.
- Man: Go, go, go, go!</i>

05:05.995 --> 05:07.829
( Gasps )
Oh, God, your face!

05:07.864 --> 05:09.764
<i>- Man: We're gonna need a medic.
- Is it bad?</i>

05:09.799 --> 05:11.132
- No.
- Yes!

05:11.166 --> 05:12.500
You're fine, ma'am.
You're fine.

05:12.534 --> 05:15.236
Madam Vice President, if you'd
just stand still, please.

05:15.270 --> 05:17.237
- Calm down, Martin. It's not a terrorist.
- I'm fine.

05:17.271 --> 05:19.206
Just lock up the hallway, guys.
It's all fine.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.106
- Lock it up. Lock it up.
- Mike: Ma'am.

05:20.141 --> 05:21.241
- Yes?
- Here's what you do.

05:21.275 --> 05:22.609
- Okay.
- Don't move.

05:22.643 --> 05:23.610
We're gonna have to cut
your clothes off you.

05:23.644 --> 05:25.612
- Huh?
- I walked through a glass door before.

05:25.646 --> 05:27.179
- This is what you do, okay?
- You're kidding.

05:27.214 --> 05:28.481
No, I was fine
because I was drunk.

05:28.515 --> 05:29.882
- You're gonna be okay.
- Oh.

05:29.916 --> 05:31.983
- Shit, the donors.
- Just go tell them

05:32.018 --> 05:33.918
I'm gonna be
a couple minutes late.

05:33.953 --> 05:35.520
- Go tell them that, okay?
- Okay, okay.

05:35.554 --> 05:38.255
- All right. What are you... no! Mike!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

05:38.289 --> 05:39.690
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

05:39.724 --> 05:41.091
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Don't... don't...

05:41.125 --> 05:42.926
- go another way, Mike.
- Okay. Okay.

05:42.961 --> 05:44.829
Ma'am, ma'am, are you hurting?

05:44.863 --> 05:45.997
Are you in pain?

05:46.064 --> 05:47.732
Uh, I don't know.

05:47.766 --> 05:49.100
Do you have a mirror?

05:50.169 --> 05:51.903
- No.
- Yes, you do.

05:51.938 --> 05:54.739
I've got some St. John's Wort
for pain relief if you want it.

05:54.773 --> 05:55.874
I don't want
to take medication.

05:55.908 --> 05:57.075
It's herbal.
It's from the earth.

05:57.109 --> 05:58.777
You can take six,
it won't affect you.

05:58.811 --> 06:01.080
- ( Both whimper )
- Look at that.

06:01.115 --> 06:03.050
- ( Shard pricks )
- Ah! Ow!

06:03.084 --> 06:05.352
( Music playing )
( Chatter )

06:06.788 --> 06:08.790
Hiya. Uh, hey.

06:08.825 --> 06:11.326
Uh, the vice president
apologizes,

06:11.361 --> 06:12.961
but she's slightly delayed.

06:12.995 --> 06:16.765
She's stuck on a call with
the Australian ambassador.

06:16.799 --> 06:18.199
The Australian ambassador?

06:18.233 --> 06:20.168
That's good.
I've never heard that one before.

06:20.202 --> 06:22.270
Sidney Purcell,
always a pleasure, sir.

06:22.304 --> 06:24.539
No, it's not, actually,
but you get marks for trying.

06:24.573 --> 06:27.075
But the vice president
is in great spirits.

06:27.109 --> 06:29.944
She's buoyantly waiting
to meet you all

06:29.979 --> 06:32.614
and I will go check, see if
I can interrupt that call.

06:32.648 --> 06:34.816
Like I said, it's a call.

06:34.884 --> 06:38.720
Strength is being
flexible and steadfast.

06:38.754 --> 06:42.023
The living willow,
not the dead oak.

06:42.058 --> 06:44.593
I learned in Iraq
that the road to respect

06:44.627 --> 06:46.561
between me and my men
ran two ways.

06:46.596 --> 06:50.399
<i>In order to get respect,
you have to give respect.</i>

06:50.433 --> 06:52.534
<i>When I look out,
I see many faces,</i>

06:52.568 --> 06:54.303
<i>but I see only one nation</i>

06:54.337 --> 06:55.971
with one aspiration,

06:56.039 --> 07:00.477
and that aspiration is to one
day hope to dream together.

07:00.511 --> 07:02.645
<i>- I met a young woman...
- No.</i>

07:02.679 --> 07:05.014
<i>Named Juanita
in St. Paul the other day.</i>

07:05.048 --> 07:06.849
<i>- Oh, crap.
- Danny: And I asked...</i>

07:06.884 --> 07:08.484
<i>You know what she said to me?</i>

07:08.518 --> 07:09.652
Oh.

07:10.620 --> 07:12.554
<i>- Dan.
- This is awkward.</i>

07:12.589 --> 07:14.423
Like catching your
sister's eye at an orgy.

07:14.490 --> 07:16.024
Well, my sister
would never be at an orgy.

07:16.058 --> 07:17.092
Too uptight.

07:17.126 --> 07:18.727
She would want health
records from everyone

07:18.761 --> 07:20.161
- and just kill the momentum and...
- Okay.

07:20.195 --> 07:21.295
I'm disappointed in you.

07:21.330 --> 07:23.231
This is behavior I would
expect from myself.

07:23.265 --> 07:24.730
But from you? Uh-uh.

07:24.877 --> 07:26.388
Let's cut the crap.
We're both here for Chung.

07:26.423 --> 07:28.503
So we both jump together.
You know, Butch and Sundance.

07:28.537 --> 07:29.737
Don't they both die?

07:29.772 --> 07:31.472
No, not when they jump.
They die at the end.

07:31.506 --> 07:33.508
- ( Cell phone ringing )
- Oh.

07:33.542 --> 07:34.942
Hey, Sue.

07:34.977 --> 07:37.946
Dan, the vice president just
walked through a glass door.

07:37.980 --> 07:39.581
She walked through
a glass door?

07:39.615 --> 07:40.615
What is that, code?

07:40.649 --> 07:42.784
No, unfortunately,
it is not, Dan.

07:42.818 --> 07:44.986
<i>It is a literal description
of what just happened.</i>

07:45.054 --> 07:47.122
And she's not too badly hurt.
Thanks for asking.

07:47.156 --> 07:49.257
She walked through
a glass door?

07:49.325 --> 07:51.860
Yeah, that woman has become a
living metaphor of her own career.

07:51.894 --> 07:55.063
( Grunting )

07:55.097 --> 07:57.098
Just make sure
you rest today, okay?

07:57.133 --> 07:59.601
I feel like one of those
old used footballs

07:59.636 --> 08:02.037
that they fixed up for the kids
at an orphanage.

08:02.072 --> 08:03.305
<i>( Door opens )</i>

08:03.340 --> 08:05.274
Good to see you've calmed down.

08:05.309 --> 08:07.544
Ma'am, plenty of rest
and no 10K run tomorrow.

08:07.578 --> 08:09.379
- Okay?
- Well, I don't know about that.

08:09.413 --> 08:12.049
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:12.083 --> 08:13.850
Uh, we told everyone
you were delayed.

08:13.885 --> 08:16.120
But we're gonna have
to cancel this thing, okay?

08:16.154 --> 08:17.455
No. Mike, what are
you talking about?

08:17.489 --> 08:18.856
I can't cancel my destiny.

08:18.890 --> 08:20.324
Ma'am, look at you.
You're wearing a robe.

08:20.359 --> 08:21.993
Unless you want to go down
there and sing them a chorus

08:22.027 --> 08:24.496
of "Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee,"
you can't go downstairs.

08:24.530 --> 08:27.031
Okay, I'll go ahead and go.

08:27.066 --> 08:28.733
Thank you very much
for your help.

08:28.768 --> 08:30.135
- Mum's the word?
- Oh, yes.

08:30.169 --> 08:32.370
- Good.
- What would I even say?

08:32.404 --> 08:34.806
We'll just tell them
what happened and reschedule.

08:34.840 --> 08:35.907
Oh! Ooh.

08:35.941 --> 08:38.009
<i>- Jesus.
- Oh, God.</i>

08:38.043 --> 08:39.376
I'm cancelling.
I'm cancelling.

08:39.410 --> 08:43.380
( Panting )

08:44.716 --> 08:46.183
- Okay, where is she?
- I don't know.

08:46.217 --> 08:49.486
I guess we just follow the trail
of her blood and Gary's tears.

08:49.521 --> 08:51.388
- Oh, hey.
- How bad is she?

08:51.422 --> 08:53.257
She's fine.
It's just superficial cuts.

08:53.291 --> 08:55.158
Did you give her
any painkillers or...?

08:55.193 --> 08:57.928
I didn't want to do that because
she's already on St. John's Wort.

08:57.962 --> 08:59.696
I think I got that off
a Catholic schoolgirl once.

08:59.731 --> 09:01.231
So why can't she take
anything else?

09:01.265 --> 09:03.133
Well, it can react
badly with the body

09:03.167 --> 09:04.768
if she's already on
immunosuppressants,

09:04.802 --> 09:06.736
beta-blockers,
or antidepressants.

09:06.770 --> 09:08.504
<i>Oh, okay, fine.
She's not on any of those.</i>

09:08.539 --> 09:10.248
I've really got to go.
Catch you guys later.

09:10.398 --> 09:11.936
Yep, thank you.

09:11.971 --> 09:13.976
- Well, she is on antidepressants.
- Yep.

09:14.011 --> 09:15.611
After you.

09:15.646 --> 09:17.813
See? You made that
look so easy.

09:17.881 --> 09:20.750
Hey, I'm sorry this isn't
the presidential suite, ma'am.

09:20.784 --> 09:23.919
Oh, it doesn't matter, Gary.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.821
Who has the presidential suite?

09:25.856 --> 09:27.390
I heard Russell Crowe.

09:27.425 --> 09:30.293
<i>- Russell Crowe, "Gladiator."
- Yeah.</i>

09:30.328 --> 09:31.728
"I'll be back."

09:31.763 --> 09:33.263
( Laughs )
Mmm...

09:33.331 --> 09:34.565
- You know who would love this robe?
- Who?

09:34.599 --> 09:35.833
- Ben.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:35.867 --> 09:38.002
Can you imagine him in this
with his big mug?

09:38.036 --> 09:39.671
- Yep, yep.
- Walking around?

09:39.705 --> 09:40.872
He'd love that.

09:40.906 --> 09:43.107
( Both laughing )

09:50.482 --> 09:52.684
- Come on, sit here.
- Okay, that's nice.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.052
- Yeah.
- Thank you, ma'am.

09:54.086 --> 09:56.621
I don't really know anything
about you, you know?

09:56.656 --> 09:58.256
You're kind of a mystery man.

09:58.290 --> 10:00.725
Ooh.

10:00.759 --> 10:02.327
Where'd you grow up?

10:02.361 --> 10:04.262
Birmingham, Alabama.

10:04.296 --> 10:05.263
( Southern accent )
You did not.

10:05.297 --> 10:07.031
( Southern accent )
I did too! I did!

10:07.066 --> 10:10.202
- Are you close to your parents?
- Close to my mom.

10:10.269 --> 10:12.570
My dad always wanted
a man for a son, so...

10:12.605 --> 10:14.506
- Oh, yeah.
- But it's a different generation.

10:14.540 --> 10:16.274
It is a different generation.
It's true.

10:16.308 --> 10:19.210
They're about to celebrate
their 40th wedding anniversary.

10:19.245 --> 10:20.779
- 4-0.
- ( Gasps ) Oh!

10:20.813 --> 10:22.647
They're gonna have
a huge blowout.

10:22.682 --> 10:24.950
- What do you mean? Like a party?
- Massive party.

10:24.984 --> 10:27.151
Massive.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:27.186 --> 10:28.419
- It's really...
- Can I come?

10:28.454 --> 10:31.990
- What?
- Could... Can I come?

10:32.024 --> 10:33.291
Are you serious?

10:33.325 --> 10:35.593
Is that completely inappropriate
for me to invite myself?

10:35.627 --> 10:37.061
Oh, my God, no.

10:37.095 --> 10:40.498
No. They...
I would love that.

10:40.532 --> 10:41.466
- Are you kidding?
- Really?

10:41.500 --> 10:43.101
<i>- ( Knock at door )
- Yes.</i>

10:43.135 --> 10:46.904
That would solve all of my
validation issues with my dad.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.505
Ma'am.
Uh, how are you?

10:48.540 --> 10:50.040
<i>Selina:
Look, Amy, watch this.</i>

10:50.074 --> 10:51.642
Look how tiny
I can make myself.

10:51.676 --> 10:54.177
- Watch this.
- ( Laughing )

10:54.212 --> 10:56.913
But the donor meeting
has been cancelled, yes?

10:56.947 --> 10:58.448
<i>Selina:
I'm not doing that thing.</i>

10:58.482 --> 11:00.083
Seriously,
screw all those people.

11:00.117 --> 11:03.219
God, I hope Iran
drops a nuke on DC.

11:03.254 --> 11:05.455
<i>- Gary: Ooh.
- Wouldn't that solve a lot of issues?</i>

11:05.489 --> 11:06.990
Except Kent wouldn't
go anywhere.

11:07.025 --> 11:08.292
He'd still be around.

11:08.326 --> 11:09.893
He's like an undead
cockroach with his...

11:09.927 --> 11:11.895
- ( Laughing )
- It's true.

11:11.930 --> 11:14.165
He's got that blank look.

11:14.199 --> 11:16.034
I bet he doesn't
even have a come face.

11:16.068 --> 11:18.703
Can you imagine
fucking that guy?

11:18.738 --> 11:20.205
Whoa.

11:20.239 --> 11:23.775
Amy, you have
such pretty blonde hair.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.276
Doesn't she?

11:25.311 --> 11:27.479
So pretty.

11:27.513 --> 11:29.748
<i>( Music playing )
( Chatter )</i>

11:29.782 --> 11:31.683
Hi, everyone.
Good morning again.

11:31.717 --> 11:34.252
Unfortunately, the vice
president is still stuck

11:34.287 --> 11:35.721
on a phone call with Australia

11:35.755 --> 11:37.489
so she's going to have
to postpone

11:37.523 --> 11:39.024
this morning's meet and
greet breakfast, okay?

11:39.059 --> 11:40.359
- ( Guests groan )
- We're very sorry.

11:40.393 --> 11:42.762
Mike, you know,
in the southern hemisphere,

11:42.796 --> 11:44.463
the bullshit actually
flows the other way.

11:44.498 --> 11:45.664
Did you know that?

11:45.699 --> 11:47.600
- The Australia thing is real.
- Yeah.

11:47.634 --> 11:49.802
- What the fuck?
- Okay, listen to me.

11:49.837 --> 11:51.638
There's been an incident
with the vice president.

11:51.672 --> 11:54.441
- Can you keep this under wraps?
- Yeah. What?

11:54.475 --> 11:56.109
She's walked through
a glass door.

11:56.177 --> 11:57.644
- She walked through a glass door?
- Shh!

11:57.678 --> 12:00.269
What, she just stumbled
into a solid piece of glass?

12:00.350 --> 12:01.688
Yes.

12:01.723 --> 12:02.615
( Laughing )

12:02.650 --> 12:04.984
That's... that's amazing.

12:06.253 --> 12:07.654
I guess it's funny

12:07.688 --> 12:09.522
because we've all
done it at one point.

12:09.556 --> 12:11.157
I haven't.

12:11.192 --> 12:12.926
I pushed someone through
a plate glass door once.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.427
That was fucking hilarious.

12:14.462 --> 12:15.929
Stop laughing.

12:15.963 --> 12:17.731
Is she okay?

12:17.765 --> 12:20.067
Mm. Just cuts.

12:20.101 --> 12:22.035
You are liaison
to the VP, right?

12:22.069 --> 12:24.204
That's your "liaison d'être"?

12:24.238 --> 12:26.039
I was born to liaise, sir.

12:26.073 --> 12:29.309
Then why can't you tell me
about what the VP was doing

12:29.343 --> 12:31.911
when she walked into
a glass fucking door?

12:31.945 --> 12:35.414
Okay, well, the VP's office
can be very insubordinate.

12:35.449 --> 12:37.583
I mean, they insubord me
all the time.

12:37.618 --> 12:39.451
You know that
they call me Jonad?

12:39.486 --> 12:42.054
I mean, that is tantamount
to calling the president Jonad.

12:42.089 --> 12:43.489
No, it's not.

12:43.523 --> 12:45.691
He's the president,
you're Jonad.

12:45.726 --> 12:48.160
Now get in there and liaise
the truth out of Sue

12:48.195 --> 12:49.562
or I'll make sure
that name sticks so hard,

12:49.596 --> 12:50.963
it ends up on your gravestone.

12:50.997 --> 12:52.398
Yes, sir.

12:54.735 --> 12:56.235
Hello there, Susan.

12:56.269 --> 12:58.471
Name's not Susan,
it's Sue... Jonad.

12:58.505 --> 13:00.139
Okay, and my name isn't Jonad!

13:00.174 --> 13:02.575
It's Jonah.
Do not disrespect me on this, Sue.

13:02.610 --> 13:06.313
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no one
here is disrespecting you...

13:06.347 --> 13:07.213
Jonad.

13:07.248 --> 13:08.948
Now go earn your name change.

13:10.484 --> 13:12.552
<i>- Sue.
- Sir.</i>

13:12.586 --> 13:14.954
What was the vice president doing
at that hotel this morning?

13:14.989 --> 13:19.792
Meet and greet with the
American Teachers Association.

13:19.826 --> 13:22.128
<i>Ben: If I call the ATA,
they would confirm</i>

13:22.162 --> 13:24.997
that she was meeting
and greeting them?

13:25.032 --> 13:26.999
Uh, couldn't say.

13:27.034 --> 13:30.102
If you can't tell me
what she was doing,

13:30.137 --> 13:33.372
maybe you can tell me
what she wasn't doing.

13:33.406 --> 13:36.808
The vice president
was not at a brunch

13:36.843 --> 13:38.210
with campaign donors.

13:38.244 --> 13:40.645
I would hope that she was not.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.247
Otherwise, I'm not sure

13:42.281 --> 13:44.249
if I wouldn't be
within my rights

13:44.283 --> 13:47.252
not to launch a drone
strike right now.

13:47.286 --> 13:49.087
I got lost in
the double negative, sir.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.121
What?

13:50.156 --> 13:51.823
I'm fuckin' furious.

13:51.858 --> 13:52.891
Jonad!

13:52.925 --> 13:55.727
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Get over to that hotel.</i>

13:55.761 --> 13:58.463
Cut your face off and give it
to the VP if you have to.

13:58.497 --> 14:00.064
Just get her to talk
to the press.

14:00.132 --> 14:01.533
Say she is not the challenger.

14:01.567 --> 14:02.834
I won't let you down, sir.

14:02.868 --> 14:04.069
- Hey.
- Yeah.

14:04.103 --> 14:05.971
I'm really excited
for that party.

14:06.005 --> 14:07.640
I am, too.
We'll dance.

14:07.674 --> 14:09.041
We'll get our dance on.

14:09.075 --> 14:11.143
( Both vocalizing )

14:11.178 --> 14:12.979
Dance on.

14:13.013 --> 14:15.615
( Panting )

14:15.649 --> 14:17.517
Why are you guys so tense?
She's completely chilled.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.252
She's out of her fucking mind.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.522
She's coming to my parents'
40th wedding anniversary.

14:21.556 --> 14:22.856
Yeah, exactly, Gary.

14:22.891 --> 14:25.325
She's out of her fucking mind.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.494
Hey, ma'am.
I cancelled the donor breakfast,

14:27.528 --> 14:29.896
but I did have to come clean about
you walking through the glass door.

14:29.931 --> 14:32.832
Great job, ass hat.
Now everyone's gonna know.

14:32.867 --> 14:35.068
Everyone's gonna find out she
walked through a glass door, Dan,

14:35.102 --> 14:38.505
because she looks like she walked
through a fucking glass door.

14:38.539 --> 14:40.307
- Yeah, check this out.
- ( Mike laughs )

14:40.341 --> 14:41.841
- What's his problem?
- I don't know.

14:41.876 --> 14:43.676
Get over here, gingerbread.

14:43.711 --> 14:45.879
You know what? That St.
John's Wort that you gave her

14:45.913 --> 14:47.981
is reacting
to her antidepressants.

14:48.015 --> 14:49.015
What are you talking about?

14:49.050 --> 14:51.318
It's herbal.
It's from the earth.

14:51.352 --> 14:54.154
- So are mushrooms, dipshit.
- Okay, that's illegal drugs.

14:54.189 --> 14:55.256
- Feel this. Feel this.
- The guns?

14:55.290 --> 14:56.624
- Jesus.
- Argh argh!

14:56.658 --> 14:58.692
- Okay. Hey!
- I'll hurt ya.

14:58.727 --> 15:01.095
- Wow, you're in a good mood.
- I am.

15:01.129 --> 15:03.197
- How are you doing?
- So-so, you know?

15:03.231 --> 15:06.132
Not great, but trying
to keep things on an even keel.

15:06.167 --> 15:07.667
Hey, what about
that boat of yours?

15:07.702 --> 15:09.536
I can't sell it.
Nobody wants to buy her.

15:09.570 --> 15:11.771
<i>How much do you want for her?</i>

15:11.806 --> 15:14.574
Honestly, I would take half just
to get rid of the damn thing.

15:14.608 --> 15:16.009
I'll give you all of it.

15:16.043 --> 15:18.645
<i>- You really want to buy my boat?
- Yeah.</i>

15:18.679 --> 15:19.946
Shake on it, Magic Mikey.

15:19.981 --> 15:21.247
- You're gonna buy my boat?
- I am.

15:21.282 --> 15:23.283
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations to you.

15:23.317 --> 15:24.851
You just got a boat.

15:24.886 --> 15:26.186
<i>- And I just got a vote.
- Amy: Mike!</i>

15:26.220 --> 15:27.287
Mike, you're needed in here.

15:27.321 --> 15:28.855
I'm coming, I'm coming.

15:28.922 --> 15:31.324
There's fucking press vans
outside, Mike.

15:31.359 --> 15:33.159
You better hope Russell Crowe
is threatening to jump.

15:33.194 --> 15:35.595
All right, we're gonna have to get
her downstairs for an appearance.

15:35.629 --> 15:37.297
Otherwise, they're gonna
start speculating.

15:37.331 --> 15:38.998
Uh duh duh.

15:40.467 --> 15:43.903
Look, she is fuckin' high
right now.

You didn't happen to notice that
the veep is tripping balls?

15:56.150 --> 15:59.152
Gary gave her something that is
reacting with her antidepressants

15:59.186 --> 16:00.720
and turning her
into Julie Andrews.

16:00.754 --> 16:02.255
( Muttering )
No, that's not doing it.

16:02.289 --> 16:04.757
Dan: We just need to keep her
here till this thing passes.

16:04.825 --> 16:06.092
What if we pump her stomach?

16:06.126 --> 16:07.493
I've had my stomach
pumped before.

16:07.528 --> 16:09.228

White House official,</i>

16:14.234 --> 16:16.001
I am commandeering
this situation, Mike.

16:16.036 --> 16:17.603
All right, what do
you guys got for me?

16:17.638 --> 16:19.372
Okay, she just walked
through a glass door,

16:19.406 --> 16:22.075
which is somewhat ironic building
up to an invisible primary,

16:22.109 --> 16:24.711
and she is temporarily insane
on a cocktail of happy pills.

16:24.745 --> 16:26.880
Over to you, Captain.

16:27.915 --> 16:29.249
You just broke his brain, Amy.

16:29.283 --> 16:31.618
Jesus, look at his stupid
gaping mouth.

16:31.653 --> 16:32.686
Let's put stuff in it.

16:32.721 --> 16:35.656
Okay, decision.
Listen up.

16:35.691 --> 16:37.058
The veep will make a statement.

16:37.092 --> 16:39.027
She will make
this statement on camera

16:39.061 --> 16:40.562
and she will make
this statement

16:40.597 --> 16:42.598
as soon as humanly
fucking possible.

16:42.632 --> 16:43.799
Ca-fuckin'-piche?

16:43.834 --> 16:46.703
What in the hell
is your problem, Andrew?

16:46.737 --> 16:47.771
What?

16:47.805 --> 16:49.306
What are you looking
at me like that for?

16:49.340 --> 16:50.840
Your...

- You called me Andrew.

16:52.877 --> 16:54.444
No, I did not.

16:54.479 --> 16:56.213
I know who you are.

16:56.247 --> 16:58.816
I can even say your name
the other way...

17:00.018 --> 17:02.286
Hanoj.

17:03.922 --> 17:05.556
( Yawns )

17:05.590 --> 17:08.026
All right, academically, Amy,
what's your first move here?

17:08.060 --> 17:10.862
- Mike, go talk to the press.
- Yeah, Mike, go talk to the press.

17:10.896 --> 17:13.865
- I'll tag team with you.
- Gary, go get her some clothes.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.035
Yeah, Gary, go get her
some fucking clothes, huh?

17:16.069 --> 17:17.869
Come on, it's time
to dress up and fess up.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.806
- ( Clapping )
- Go, go, go.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.509
Gotta say, I think
I handled that pretty well.

17:25.811 --> 17:28.114
( Snoring )

17:31.853 --> 17:33.921
There's something so sexy
about being in a hotel

17:33.955 --> 17:35.523
in the middle
of the day, right?

17:35.557 --> 17:37.124
Yep, four people to one toilet.

17:37.159 --> 17:38.926
You can hear everything
that hits the water.

17:38.961 --> 17:40.494
( Cell phone chiming )

17:40.529 --> 17:42.463
Where the fuck are you?
Picking cotton to weave?

17:42.497 --> 17:43.998
Amy, I can't find anything
to cover her up.

17:44.032 --> 17:45.166
She doesn't have
any turtlenecks.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.567
I've narrowed it down
to four looks.

17:46.602 --> 17:47.802
Just get back here.

17:47.836 --> 17:50.004
Give me a number between
one and four, please.

17:50.038 --> 17:51.972
- Four.
- I think I prefer three.

17:52.006 --> 17:54.141
- Fucking three, then.
- Actually, four's good.

Okay, it has been three hours.

I need her on television now.

18:03.351 --> 18:05.018
Do I need to draw you
a line graph, Jonah?

18:05.053 --> 18:06.586
More time equals less cuckoo.

18:06.621 --> 18:09.522
We need to take a cold dump
on the speculation.

18:09.557 --> 18:11.958
Is she the mystery challenger
who's going to throw her hat

18:11.993 --> 18:14.060
into the ring to challenge
POTUS in two years?

18:14.094 --> 18:17.764
We need to send the message that
the ring is a hat-free zone.

18:17.798 --> 18:20.233
No berets, no Stetsons,
no beanies...

18:20.267 --> 18:22.001
Why are you just listing hats?

18:22.035 --> 18:24.036
Jonah's right.
Ahem.

18:24.071 --> 18:26.672
I've gotta put my face
out there, my fucked-up face.

18:26.707 --> 18:29.275
I feel so good.
I had such a deep sleep.

18:29.310 --> 18:31.945
Looks like I'll just be sitting
over here being right.

18:31.979 --> 18:34.481
Yeah, in 700 days of working
with us, you've been right once.

'Cause that's not my style.

18:53.735 --> 18:55.470
What happened is that I, um...

18:55.504 --> 18:57.772
I walked through a glass door.

18:57.807 --> 19:01.643
And the only thing that's
really hurt is my pride.

19:01.677 --> 19:03.745
Were there any mitigating
circumstances?

19:03.780 --> 19:05.847
Was there carpeting or...?

19:05.882 --> 19:07.149
- Was there carpeting there, Mike?
- Yes.

19:07.183 --> 19:08.884
There was.
Yes, it has been confirmed

19:08.918 --> 19:10.719
that there was carpeting there.

19:10.754 --> 19:12.287
You will be doing the Get

19:12.322 --> 19:14.756
I fully intend to run.

Oh, no,

speculation, okay?

19:43.551 --> 19:44.817
She can't do the Fun Run.

19:44.852 --> 19:46.920
She can barely do a convincing
walk at the moment.

- Can't and won't.

karaoke restaurant

Oh, no, you didn't.

worse, don't you think?

23:40.722 --> 23:42.256
Amy: Okay,
give me Gary again.

23:42.290 --> 23:44.457
- Please, get me Gary again.
- You know what? Pull over here.

23:44.492 --> 23:46.592
Mike: Could this go to
an impeachment vote?

23:46.627 --> 23:49.095
( Tires screech )
All right, look, you guys go ahead.

23:49.129 --> 23:51.064
We're gonna make sure Gary
keeps up with her. Okay, okay.

23:51.098 --> 23:53.733
- Gary! Gary, come here!
- Gary! Gary!

23:53.767 --> 23:55.635
Mike: As soon as she
crosses the finish line,

23:55.669 --> 23:57.103
the press is gonna be
all over her.

23:57.137 --> 23:58.971
- All right, so what do we say?
- Hang on, hang on.

23:59.006 --> 24:00.974
- No, no, fuck it. We gotta go.
- No, come on, man.

24:01.008 --> 24:02.242
- Come on!
- Fuck!

24:02.276 --> 24:03.210
Gary!

24:03.244 --> 24:04.244
Amy: Gary.

24:04.278 --> 24:06.112
What? What?

24:06.146 --> 24:08.515
The Judiciary Committee
is talking impeachment vote.

24:08.549 --> 24:09.749
We need to give her a response.

24:09.784 --> 24:10.683
I'm way behind.

24:10.718 --> 24:12.919
If I keep talking,
I'm gonna vomit.

24:12.953 --> 24:14.321
Jonah?

24:14.355 --> 24:16.156
Yeah. What's up,
you fuckin' Lorax?

24:16.190 --> 24:18.925
Hey, Dan, if you're trying to
get a statement to the veep,

24:18.960 --> 24:22.596
it's this... full commitment to
the president, total backing.

24:22.630 --> 24:24.831
No, no, no, no. She will support
him, but she will not back him.

24:24.866 --> 24:28.168
- He's too toxic.
- No, full backing, full support.

24:28.202 --> 24:30.971
Oh, God, this zipper is like
a cheese grater on my dick.

24:31.005 --> 24:34.408
Ha ha! Lorax.
( Huffing )

24:34.442 --> 24:36.376
So which one of us do you think

24:36.444 --> 24:39.712
Andre the Giant Jagoff
is gonna obey?

24:39.747 --> 24:40.947
- Jonah?
- Yeah.

24:40.981 --> 24:42.983
- 100 bucks says you.
- Really?

24:43.017 --> 24:44.651
He's an idiot.

24:44.685 --> 24:47.854
I'm surprised he gets to work without being
hit by a car or punched in the mouth.

24:47.888 --> 24:49.856
- Hi!
- Excuse me.

24:49.890 --> 24:53.058
Ma'am, Amy says,
"I give my support

24:53.093 --> 24:55.193
to the president in this
very challenging time."

24:55.228 --> 24:57.796
Emphasize it's important to respect
the process of the hearing.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.297
She needs a get-out.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.766
Cut to the chase, Amy.
I'm being overtaken by a banana.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.901
I can't breathe.
Oh, I can't breathe.

25:03.935 --> 25:06.604
Ma'am, I need you to speed up
or slow down.

25:06.638 --> 25:08.639
We can't have you in a photo
finish with a banana.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.775
- Yeah.
- It's a caption contest waiting to happen.

25:10.809 --> 25:12.977
Yeah, I'm not gonna
get beaten by a banana.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.717
( Crowd cheering )

25:18.751 --> 25:20.952
<i>Reporter: Madam Vice President!
Madam Vice President!</i>

25:20.987 --> 25:22.488
- Reporter 2: Well done.
- Thank you.

25:22.522 --> 25:23.655
- Reporter 2: Nice job.
- Thank you.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.824
- Not bad, considering, huh?
- Yeah.

25:25.859 --> 25:27.259
Feels good to get moving, guys.

25:27.294 --> 25:29.995
Oh, my God, it gets
the blood pumping.

25:30.030 --> 25:34.233
You know, the key really,
folks, to a healthy lifestyle

25:34.268 --> 25:36.636
<i>- is exercising well.
- Hoo!</i>

25:36.670 --> 25:38.771
- Thank you.
- Any comment on the impeachment rumors?

25:38.805 --> 25:40.940
I, of course, have given
my full account

25:40.974 --> 25:43.109
of what I knew

25:43.143 --> 25:46.211
and now I'm sure

25:46.246 --> 25:47.713
the president will do the same.

25:47.747 --> 25:50.683
- ( Reporters clamoring )
- That's it, that's it.

25:50.717 --> 25:51.884
( Groans )

25:51.918 --> 25:53.285
Come on, put your hands
above your head.

25:53.320 --> 25:54.587
- Put your... get them up.
- ( Wheezes )

25:54.621 --> 25:55.922
<i>Dan: Come on, buddy. Let's go.</i>

25:55.956 --> 25:57.757
<i>- Mike, come on.
- Well done, ma'am.</i>

25:57.791 --> 25:59.559
( Sighs )
I am done.

25:59.593 --> 26:01.294
Mm-hmm.
Yes, ma'am, you're all done.

26:01.328 --> 26:03.830
I mean I am done.
I am done with all of it.

26:03.864 --> 26:05.999
The vice presidency...
I mean forget it.

26:06.033 --> 26:07.901
Seriously, Amy.

26:07.935 --> 26:10.470
You can see what's
coming, can't you?

26:10.504 --> 26:13.373
He's gonna implicate me
in all of this.

26:13.407 --> 26:15.375
All of it.

26:15.409 --> 26:18.011
And then it's gonna be
two years of standing

26:18.045 --> 26:21.181
next to this man that I loathe.

26:21.215 --> 26:23.750
Is this just
the St. John's Wort talking?

26:23.785 --> 26:26.053
Look at me.
I'm covered in scabs.

26:26.087 --> 26:29.656
( Sniffs )
I smell like a hobo's craphole.

26:29.691 --> 26:31.658
Forget it.
Forget it.

26:31.693 --> 26:35.329
I'm not gonna run
with him in two years.

26:35.363 --> 26:37.031
I'm not gonna be
his vice president.

26:37.065 --> 26:38.632
I'm finished.

26:38.667 --> 26:39.967
I'll come back in six years

26:40.001 --> 26:42.002
and I'll save the party
from itself.

26:42.037 --> 26:44.672
Hey, do you know what my
time was, by the way?

26:44.706 --> 26:47.341
- Uh, what's good?
- Like an eight-minute mile.

26:47.375 --> 26:48.909
<i>- That.
- Yeah?</i>

26:48.943 --> 26:50.577
Yeah, let's get moving...

26:50.611 --> 26:52.212
( Sirens blaring )

26:52.246 --> 26:53.647
Oh.

26:53.681 --> 26:55.515
Oh, my God.
( Coughing )

26:55.550 --> 26:57.617
That was really rough.

26:57.652 --> 26:59.820
<i>- ( Sighs )
- Selina: Hey, Mike,</i>

26:59.854 --> 27:02.289
I have some sort of hazy memory

27:02.323 --> 27:06.093
of me promising to buy your...

27:06.127 --> 27:08.295
your boat.

27:08.329 --> 27:10.263
Yeah, you did.
Well remembered.

27:10.298 --> 27:11.631
That's not gonna happen.

27:11.666 --> 27:13.066
You can't hold me
to that, right?

27:13.101 --> 27:16.470
Yeah, no.
Sure. Of course.

27:16.504 --> 27:18.872
Man, that is low.

27:18.907 --> 27:22.176
That's like trying to have sex
with somebody who's passed out.

27:22.210 --> 27:24.478
Hey, ma'am, ahem...

27:25.413 --> 27:28.115
about my parents' party...

27:28.149 --> 27:29.950
What? I thought
your parents were dead.

27:29.985 --> 27:31.986
<i>- No.
- No?</i>

27:32.020 --> 27:34.789
No. Um...

27:34.823 --> 27:37.325
It's their
40th wedding anniversary

27:37.359 --> 27:40.862
and you wanted to come and
we were gonna go dancing.

27:40.897 --> 27:42.664
You know, it's gonna be
a big blowout.

27:42.699 --> 27:45.434
Okay, I'm the Vice President
of the United States.

27:45.468 --> 27:46.902
<i>- Yeah.
- You know.</i>

27:46.937 --> 27:49.305
I can't be running off
to shindigs

27:49.339 --> 27:51.941
put on by the parents
of people on my staff.

27:51.975 --> 27:53.542
You know what I mean?
That's completely...

27:53.577 --> 27:56.245
- Yeah, sure.
- ...absurd, you know?

27:56.279 --> 27:58.981
I mean, you've never... never even
mentioned your parents before.

27:59.016 --> 28:01.617
I've just always assumed
that they were dead.

28:01.651 --> 28:03.790
I mean, why wouldn't
I make that assumption?

28:03.791 --> 28:05.575
Why wouldn't you, right?
Yeah, totally. Yeah.

28:05.610 --> 28:07.593
Let's get back for a second here...

28:07.628 --> 28:10.060
- Your parents are not dead?
- No.

28:10.095 --> 28:12.705
It's so funny that you thought
that they were too.

28:12.940 --> 28:14.992
I thought you were adopted.
