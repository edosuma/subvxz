WEBVTT

00:06.026 --> 00:08.260
In New York, they have soirees.

00:08.362 --> 00:10.347
In L.A., they have galas.

00:10.354 --> 00:11.654
But at East Indiana State,

00:11.722 --> 00:13.455
you haven't lived
till you've been to the annual

00:13.557 --> 00:16.058
Axl, Hutch, and Kenny 'Bago Bash...

00:16.126 --> 00:18.160
beverages and food not included.

00:18.229 --> 00:21.018
All right!

00:21.120 --> 00:22.641
We did it, man.

00:22.787 --> 00:24.333
Senior year... We're going out on top.

00:24.435 --> 00:27.136
- Whoa!
- Whatcha got in the bag?

00:27.171 --> 00:30.005
Pita chips and no hummus.

00:30.059 --> 00:31.325
The flier specified

00:31.427 --> 00:34.128
"All chips to be accompanied
by their respective dips."

00:34.197 --> 00:35.529
Well, let's send it through the skylight

00:35.598 --> 00:37.131
and see what the people have to say.

00:40.737 --> 00:42.269
You got lucky. The people are drunk.

00:42.372 --> 00:44.105
All right. Come on.

00:44.140 --> 00:45.806
Come on in.

00:45.908 --> 00:48.668
Wow. We're legends on this campus,

00:48.771 --> 00:50.751
and we owe it all to the 'Bago.

00:50.812 --> 00:52.212
She's been good to us.

00:52.314 --> 00:53.480
Yes, she has.

00:53.582 --> 00:56.016
Wait. What are we gonna do
with it when we graduate?

00:56.118 --> 00:57.284
I mean, I can't take it with me,

00:57.386 --> 00:58.518
'cause I'm gonna be in grad school.

00:58.620 --> 00:59.886
Well, I can't take it.

00:59.955 --> 01:01.755
I got a business degree
from East Indiana State.

01:01.823 --> 01:04.424
I'm gonna be, like...
a C.E.O. of a business,

01:04.525 --> 01:06.326
doing business stuff, you know?

01:06.428 --> 01:07.761
Carrying a briefcase down hallways,

01:07.863 --> 01:09.129
asking people about their weekends.

01:09.231 --> 01:10.196
Okay.

01:10.299 --> 01:12.132
What if we give it to a needy freshman,

01:12.234 --> 01:13.300
let the legend continue?

01:13.402 --> 01:15.969
Or... we could sell it
to a needy freshman

01:16.071 --> 01:17.304
and let the legend continue.

01:17.406 --> 01:20.307
Oh, you are a business man.

01:20.409 --> 01:21.775
Mm-hmm.

01:21.877 --> 01:23.843
Whoo-hoo!

01:26.748 --> 01:29.783
Oh, hey! Is it Crazy Hat Day?
That's one of my favorites.

01:29.885 --> 01:31.251
No, it is not.

01:33.455 --> 01:35.488
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

01:35.591 --> 01:37.557
You can't be the beret kid.

01:37.659 --> 01:40.393
I don't care how many
bullying seminars they have.

01:40.462 --> 01:42.696
A beret is just a big,
fat target on your back.

01:42.764 --> 01:44.698
It isn't a beret. It's a "tam."

01:44.800 --> 01:48.134
Yeah, well, be prepared to fish
your tam out of the toilet.

01:48.819 --> 01:51.538
Anyway, you've heard
of the musical "Hamilton"?

01:51.640 --> 01:52.606
No. Yes.

01:52.708 --> 01:53.974
Well, the school is voting on

01:54.076 --> 01:55.775
what the spring play
should be this year,

01:55.877 --> 01:56.977
and I was thinking,

01:57.112 --> 01:58.712
with the recent popularity
of "Hamilton,"

01:58.814 --> 02:00.280
that I would write and submit my own.

02:00.382 --> 02:02.882
Because if we're celebrating
unsung heroes,

02:02.985 --> 02:05.185
I believe there's someone
we're all forgetting.

02:05.954 --> 02:08.321
Sergeant Charles Stuart MacKenzie!

02:08.423 --> 02:09.556
It's got everything...

02:09.657 --> 02:12.525
World War I, bagpipes, Scottish rap.

02:12.628 --> 02:14.227
I can't leave work today to pick him up

02:14.296 --> 02:16.029
- when the nurse calls.
- Well, I can't, either.

02:16.131 --> 02:18.164
Dr. Goodwin's getting me
to take me to some seminar.

02:18.266 --> 02:19.699
Well, hopefully it'll happen on the bus

02:19.801 --> 02:21.801
and the driver will just
carry him to the stoop.

02:21.870 --> 02:24.037
They all laughed at Lin-Manuel Miranda.

02:24.139 --> 02:25.836
- That's true.
- Who's she?

02:28.210 --> 02:30.677
Well, hey, there, Brick. Nice tam.

02:30.746 --> 02:32.379
Thank you for saying so.

02:32.481 --> 02:35.582
Now you have a great day and be fierce.

02:35.684 --> 02:36.683
I will.

02:36.785 --> 02:39.285
See, that's supportive parenting
right there.

02:42.290 --> 02:43.490
Hey!

02:43.592 --> 02:46.026
Who is ready for an eight-hour
lecture on polymers?

02:46.128 --> 02:47.360
I'll give you hint...

02:47.429 --> 02:48.361
It's me!

02:48.463 --> 02:49.729
Yeah. Can't wait.

02:49.831 --> 02:52.165
Uh, so, Mike, uh,
how's things at the quarry?

02:52.267 --> 02:55.035
A little rocky?

02:55.103 --> 02:56.936
Kidding.

02:57.039 --> 02:59.606
Uh, anyhoo, do you guys
have seminars, too?

02:59.708 --> 03:01.541
No. Not really.

03:01.643 --> 03:04.044
The job's pretty much the job.

03:04.112 --> 03:05.945
Mm-hmm. Well, uh, what do you have then?

03:06.048 --> 03:07.847
And feel free to go into detail.

03:09.384 --> 03:10.316
Drive safe.

03:13.355 --> 03:15.021
You were looking on the wrong side.

03:15.123 --> 03:16.856
I told you,
the pain is on his left side.

03:16.958 --> 03:18.958
Frankie, this is cuckoo.

03:19.061 --> 03:21.728
I need my chair and my light
and my spit sucker.

03:21.830 --> 03:23.663
His tooth is killing him,
but I haven't been able

03:23.765 --> 03:25.565
to get him to a dentist
in years, so I am sorry,

03:25.667 --> 03:27.934
but if you want to diagnose him,
you got to do it here.

03:28.036 --> 03:29.332
Now get in there.

03:33.575 --> 03:35.875
Oh. I see you're drinking coffee.

03:35.944 --> 03:37.310
I sure like coffee.

03:37.412 --> 03:39.112
Uh, how do you take your coffee?

03:39.214 --> 03:42.558
Do you take it bla-a-ck
or with cre-e-e-am?

03:43.085 --> 03:44.284
Black.

03:44.386 --> 03:45.351
Cool.

03:45.454 --> 03:46.486
Ooh!

03:46.588 --> 03:47.654
Hey, can I show you my new phone?

03:47.729 --> 03:49.895
It's got all sorts
of neat stuff on here.

03:49.958 --> 03:51.725
It can tell you how many steps
you've stepped.

03:51.827 --> 03:53.193
It can tell you
the temperature in Charlotte.

03:53.261 --> 03:55.428
It's even got a camera on it.

03:55.530 --> 03:56.596
Smile!

03:58.533 --> 03:59.766
Frankie!

04:02.557 --> 04:03.661
Really?

04:03.730 --> 04:06.002
Well, I'm sorry, but you've been
in pain for months,

04:06.027 --> 04:07.360
and you won't go see anybody.

04:07.429 --> 04:09.562
You won't go see the dentist.
You won't see the doctor.

04:09.631 --> 04:11.431
And I haven't died yet.

04:11.499 --> 04:13.866
You don't have to feel
embarrassed, you know?

04:13.935 --> 04:16.803
A lot of people are hinky
about the dentist.

04:16.870 --> 04:18.070
Well, thank you for that,

04:18.106 --> 04:19.738
but I'm not hinky about anything.

04:19.841 --> 04:21.741
I just don't like the idea
of someone poking around

04:21.810 --> 04:23.643
where they got no business being.

04:23.711 --> 04:25.511
I just want you to take care
of yourself, all right,

04:25.580 --> 04:28.147
and now is the time to do it
when I have free dental care.

04:28.249 --> 04:30.731
Please? I need you.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.053
I can't get Axl to do anything.

04:32.140 --> 04:33.806
Right. All right. Enough.

04:33.875 --> 04:35.441
Enough talking about it.
I'll do it, okay?

04:35.543 --> 04:37.076
- You happy?
- Oh.

04:37.145 --> 04:39.445
There's a lot of road to travel
between me and that destination,

04:39.547 --> 04:40.746
but I am relieved.

04:40.848 --> 04:41.847
Thank you.

04:42.718 --> 04:44.056
And don't worry, Mike.

04:44.191 --> 04:45.924
I promise, I'll be gentle.

04:47.126 --> 04:48.593
Look at these little woman hands.

04:48.696 --> 04:50.028
When I hold hands with a girl,

04:50.130 --> 04:51.596
sometimes I can't tell who's who.

04:55.602 --> 04:57.302
Lexie, we're gonna need more milk.

04:57.404 --> 04:59.871
"Milk" has been added
to your shopping list.

04:59.940 --> 05:02.374
Okay, I'm sorry.
I just cannot get used to that.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.443
You got used to the 36 jets in the tub.

05:04.545 --> 05:06.262
You can do this.

05:06.336 --> 05:08.236
I'll tell you another thing
I can get used to...

05:08.338 --> 05:10.138
a possible boyfriend!

05:10.207 --> 05:12.073
Is it the super-hot guy
that drives the Jeep?

05:12.175 --> 05:14.142
No, it's the attainable
guy who drives a golf cart.

05:14.244 --> 05:15.210
Who?

05:15.278 --> 05:16.544
You know, Tyler, the safety-cart guy

05:16.580 --> 05:18.113
who takes injured people around
during the day

05:18.181 --> 05:19.280
and drunk people home at night?

05:19.349 --> 05:21.077
He kind of looks like
Woody from "Toy Story."

05:21.131 --> 05:22.464
Oh!

05:22.533 --> 05:24.399
Well, Woody's definitely
the hottest one in "Toy Story."

05:24.501 --> 05:26.034
I know, right?

05:26.103 --> 05:28.503
Anyway, he seems super sweet and nice,

05:28.572 --> 05:30.405
but I'm not sure
if he's interested in me.

05:30.474 --> 05:33.709
Every time it seems
like something's maybe about to happen,

05:33.744 --> 05:35.978
we get to where we're going,
and I have to get out.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.714
Next time, tell him you have
to go to the Pharmacy Building.

05:38.816 --> 05:40.961
That's, like, practically off campus.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.242
Oh. Good idea.

05:43.277 --> 05:44.944
I hope he likes me.

05:45.046 --> 05:46.345
I need a man!

05:46.447 --> 05:49.648
"Man" has been added
to your shopping list.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.716
Oh, she's good.

05:50.785 --> 05:51.851
Mm-hmm.

05:53.154 --> 05:54.720
I'm surprised you didn't want to come in

05:54.822 --> 05:56.121
on a day Frankie was working.

05:56.224 --> 05:58.023
She is such a hoot.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.427
Sometimes she pretends
to nod off while working

06:01.529 --> 06:03.896
and slumps right over onto her patient.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.365
So, here's how this is gonna work.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.200
You're gonna tell Frankie
you checked out my tooth,

06:08.269 --> 06:10.434
it's fine, and that's
gonna be the end of it.

06:10.522 --> 06:12.689
Oh. Oh, I don't know, Mike.

06:12.757 --> 06:15.591
That would be a lie.
I don't like to lie.

06:15.660 --> 06:17.260
What would I tell Frankie?

06:17.362 --> 06:19.095
Well, if it makes you feel
better, we can go grab a beer

06:19.197 --> 06:20.563
and that way when she says,
"How'd it go?"

06:20.665 --> 06:22.865
you can say you spent an hour with me

06:22.968 --> 06:25.101
and I was happy,
and that would all be true.

06:25.537 --> 06:27.437
Okay, I guess I'm in.

06:27.539 --> 06:28.838
All right.

06:28.940 --> 06:30.340
Uh! This feels so wrong!

06:30.442 --> 06:32.375
We're like Thelma and Louise.

06:32.444 --> 06:33.609
No, we're not.

06:37.044 --> 06:39.345
All right. Thank you all for signing in.

06:39.532 --> 06:42.334
As you can see, we are sitting
in the dining room

06:42.359 --> 06:44.826
featuring a low-maintenance
Formica table.

06:44.895 --> 06:47.696
And over here, we have
the European-style kitchen

06:47.731 --> 06:51.366
featuring a fridge
and bonus second-story access.

06:52.150 --> 06:53.849
Now, the fridge holds up to three cans

06:53.952 --> 06:55.518
of your favorite beverage and an apple.

06:55.553 --> 06:57.119
Now, you might want to supplement that

06:57.155 --> 06:59.522
with a cooler or two,
but on the plus side,

06:59.591 --> 07:01.324
you can use them for seats.
That's right.

07:01.392 --> 07:03.960
The possibilities
of 'Bago living are endless.

07:04.028 --> 07:06.162
Now if you'll kindly
follow us to the bathroom.

07:06.230 --> 07:07.863
And I urge all of you to stay together.

07:07.966 --> 07:09.498
I don't want to lose anyone.

07:14.706 --> 07:16.973
You get used to that! You...

07:17.075 --> 07:19.575
It's not for everyone.

07:23.232 --> 07:25.047
- Hello?
- Are you alone?

07:25.611 --> 07:26.977
Yes. Good.

07:27.046 --> 07:28.279
So, I did what you said.

07:28.347 --> 07:30.114
When Frankie asked how it went,
I said, "Fine."

07:30.216 --> 07:31.315
Great.

07:31.350 --> 07:32.249
Wait. There's more.

07:32.351 --> 07:33.984
I said you had mesial distal occlusal

07:34.053 --> 07:36.023
with a slight pulp horn exposure.

07:36.048 --> 07:37.014
You got that?

07:37.083 --> 07:38.582
Mesial distal occlusal

07:38.651 --> 07:40.951
with a slight pulp horn exposure.

07:41.053 --> 07:42.453
Or you could have just said

07:42.521 --> 07:44.021
you took care of it, and we're done.

07:44.090 --> 07:45.823
I wish you would have
told me that before,

07:45.925 --> 07:47.057
'cause I said yoneed to come in

07:47.126 --> 07:48.125
for a follow-up appointment.

07:48.227 --> 07:49.569
Why'd you tell her that?

07:49.638 --> 07:51.195
Because you had a mesial distal occlusal

07:51.263 --> 07:53.364
- with a slight pulp horn exposure!
- I didn't!

07:53.432 --> 07:55.214
Listen, if we're gonna
get away with this,

07:55.321 --> 07:56.687
we got to get our story straight.

07:56.755 --> 07:59.289
This thing lives or dies in the details.

07:59.358 --> 08:01.525
Now, Frankie's coming home
with the appointment card.

08:01.627 --> 08:03.493
Just act casual.

08:03.529 --> 08:05.229
This conversation never happened.

08:07.981 --> 08:09.314
So...

08:09.383 --> 08:11.416
I hear someone had
a mesial distal occlusal

08:11.485 --> 08:13.418
with a slight pulp horn exposure.

08:13.487 --> 08:15.153
Mm-hmm. See?

08:15.255 --> 08:17.022
I told you it wasn't nothing.

08:17.091 --> 08:18.824
Here's your card for the follow-up.

08:18.926 --> 08:20.392
Oh, yeah.

08:20.461 --> 08:22.194
Oh, w... Thursday? No.

08:22.262 --> 08:24.029
Th-That's a... That's a Pacers game.

08:24.131 --> 08:26.031
It's... You know what?
I'll... I'll call him.

08:26.133 --> 08:27.450
I'll figure it out.

08:29.803 --> 08:31.136
Can I run a few things by you, Dad?

08:31.205 --> 08:32.571
You know a lot about musicals.

08:32.972 --> 08:33.638
No, I don't.

08:33.777 --> 08:35.811
Ane, twa, three.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:45.164 --> 08:46.314
Wait a minute.

08:46.377 --> 08:47.943
As I hear "goat," I'm not loving it.

08:48.012 --> 08:49.211
I'm gonna work on that.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.213
Good idea. Don't rush it. It's art.

08:51.315 --> 08:52.381
Hmm.

08:52.795 --> 08:54.140
Okay.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.787
I changed your appointment for you.

08:55.860 --> 08:57.460
It's with Dr. Lambert now.

08:58.187 --> 08:59.920
What? Why'd you do that?

08:59.989 --> 09:01.355
So you could see your game.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.389
No.

09:02.491 --> 09:03.557
That... That's not gonna work.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.958
I-I don't want to see some other doctor.

09:05.027 --> 09:06.693
I-I only want Dr. Goodwin.

09:06.796 --> 09:07.761
Aww, that's sweet.

09:07.863 --> 09:09.663
But Dr. Lambert is really good.

09:09.732 --> 09:10.964
He's even staying late

09:11.033 --> 09:13.233
and missing his kid's volleyball
game so he can do this.

09:13.302 --> 09:16.370
Well, hang on. I don't think
I want to see a guy like that.

09:16.438 --> 09:18.472
I mean, a guy who doesn't
put his own kids first?

09:18.541 --> 09:21.044
Brick, knock it off.

09:21.146 --> 09:22.843
I want Dr. Goodwin.

09:22.912 --> 09:25.112
I-I-I will only accept Dr. Goodwin.

09:25.214 --> 09:28.282
You were right. He is the best.

09:28.827 --> 09:29.660
All right.

09:29.685 --> 09:30.750
I'll change it back for you,

09:30.819 --> 09:31.952
but you're gonna miss
some of the Pacers game.

09:32.020 --> 09:33.086
I-I don't care.

09:33.155 --> 09:35.155
It's worth it if I can see
the world's best doctor.

09:35.257 --> 09:37.557
Wow. You must be really
in a lot of pain.

09:37.659 --> 09:40.060
You have no idea.

09:42.664 --> 09:44.664
Hey, I got your call,
and I rushed right over.

09:44.733 --> 09:47.067
Of course, I'm not sure it can
be classified as rushing

09:47.169 --> 09:48.969
at six miles an hour. Yeah.

09:49.472 --> 09:51.171
Oh, thanks for picking me up
from the party.

09:51.240 --> 09:52.806
I walked by some kids who were smoking,

09:52.875 --> 09:54.608
and I held my breath
for as long as I could,

09:54.677 --> 09:55.943
but then I had to take a breath.

09:56.045 --> 09:57.511
And I don't know what they were smoking,

09:57.580 --> 09:58.846
but it could have been marijuana,

09:58.914 --> 10:00.681
because one of them had a knit hat on.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.583
- Sounds like I got here just in time.
- Mm-hmm.

10:02.685 --> 10:03.942
Yeah.

10:07.205 --> 10:10.591
Yeah, so... the whole party
thing's not really my scene.

10:10.660 --> 10:12.901
- Yeah, me neither.
- Oh, really?

10:12.970 --> 10:15.060
Yeah, I'd much rather have,
like, a nice dinner,

10:15.134 --> 10:17.835
cozy evening in,
maybe watch some Netflix.

10:17.937 --> 10:18.936
I'm basically 40.

10:19.005 --> 10:20.771
Mm-hmm.

10:20.873 --> 10:22.339
Anyway, I'll have you home
in just a minute.

10:22.408 --> 10:25.176
Oh, actually, I have to go
to the Pharmacy Building

10:25.244 --> 10:26.644
to pick up a notebook.

10:26.746 --> 10:29.413
Sorry. I know it's all the way
on the other side of campus.

10:29.482 --> 10:32.683
No, I don't mind.
There's beautiful moon tonight.

10:32.752 --> 10:34.818
It is beautiful, isn't it?

10:35.913 --> 10:37.469
You know what? It actually
reminds me of that movie

10:37.538 --> 10:38.837
"A Tree Falls for Forest."

10:38.878 --> 10:39.844
What's that?

10:39.913 --> 10:41.279
Oh, it's so bad, it's good.

10:41.347 --> 10:42.546
It's about this freakishly tall girl

10:42.649 --> 10:44.605
who falls for a guy named Forest.

10:44.707 --> 10:45.806
Yeah, you got to see it.

10:45.874 --> 10:47.451
Oh. I got to check it out.

10:47.520 --> 10:48.653
I love movies that are good

10:48.688 --> 10:50.354
but you make fun of
and are about tall people.

10:51.724 --> 10:53.758
Well, you know,
if you wanted to see it, uh...

10:53.860 --> 10:56.093
Dude, you got to get me
to the grad dorm fast,

10:56.195 --> 10:57.828
'cause that's where I live.

10:57.897 --> 10:58.896
Jeremy?

10:58.998 --> 11:00.917
Well, well, well.

11:01.011 --> 11:02.377
Look who's here.

11:02.446 --> 11:05.747
The girl who fracked my heart!

11:05.849 --> 11:07.315
Shh! Do you know this guy?

11:07.417 --> 11:09.017
Uh, yeah. No.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.718
We kind of dated a little bit.

11:10.821 --> 11:12.287
Oh! Oh! Is that we did?

11:12.389 --> 11:13.922
W-We dated a little bit?

11:13.990 --> 11:16.524
I haven't had the energy
to chain my myself to anything

11:16.593 --> 11:17.659
in months.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.894
So... So is this the guy
you replaced me with?

11:19.963 --> 11:21.930
- Huh? Huh?
- Hey, Woody, where's Buzz?

11:21.998 --> 11:25.500
No! Shh, no, no, no.
I mean, Tyler and I aren't...

11:25.569 --> 11:28.536
I-I-I just breathed something in
that I shouldn't have, okay?

11:28.638 --> 11:30.405
That's all. I just wanted to feel safe.

11:30.507 --> 11:32.440
Wait, Jeremy.
Is that meat in your beard?

11:32.509 --> 11:34.943
You get over yourself.
You didn't drive me to eat meat.

11:35.011 --> 11:37.579
It's imitation... just like your love.

11:37.647 --> 11:38.947
Stop!

11:39.049 --> 11:41.315
I have to puke, and I want
to do it on the Econ Building

11:41.351 --> 11:42.884
- so it'll mean something.
- Ugh!

11:47.043 --> 11:49.644
I'm sorry. That was totally awkward.

11:49.679 --> 11:51.679
Uh... we broke up a couple months ago.

11:52.715 --> 11:54.582
You can just drop me off
at my apartment.

11:54.651 --> 11:55.750
Well, in that case,
it looks like we're here.

11:55.852 --> 11:57.551
Oh.

11:57.654 --> 11:59.720
Okay, well...

11:59.789 --> 12:01.822
You know what? I think
you need to see that movie.

12:01.924 --> 12:03.491
So consider my cart at your disposal.

12:03.559 --> 12:05.026
I'll pick you up tomorrow at 8:00?

12:05.094 --> 12:07.328
You could even pick me up at 7:00.

12:07.397 --> 12:09.363
Or 8:00. 8:00's fine.

12:11.987 --> 12:14.153
Brilliant! Brilliant, I say.

12:14.213 --> 12:16.814
All I know is,
nobody can resist the lure

12:16.882 --> 12:19.349
of a car-dealership blow-up wiggly guy.

12:19.451 --> 12:21.018
Wiggly-guy high five!

12:21.120 --> 12:23.603
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

12:23.710 --> 12:25.710
I don't even need to ask any question,

12:25.735 --> 12:27.191
I'll take it.

12:27.293 --> 12:28.659
Yeah.

12:30.863 --> 12:32.740
- Okay.
- Not a bad day.

12:32.809 --> 12:34.898
We made $54.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.400
I can sell anything.

12:36.468 --> 12:38.869
- Except for the 'Bago, apparently.
- Yeah. Why... God!

12:38.904 --> 12:40.537
I can't believe there aren't
three dudes like us out there,

12:40.606 --> 12:42.703
looking to live in a rocking 'Bago.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.347
Hey, is this Winnebago still for sale?

12:46.269 --> 12:48.391
Uh... well, there is someone

12:48.416 --> 12:50.550
who's very interested
coming by to look at it,

12:50.585 --> 12:52.585
but since you guys are here now,
first come, first serve.

12:52.687 --> 12:54.554
Ah. I like it.

12:54.656 --> 12:55.688
What do you think?

12:55.757 --> 12:58.057
It's cool. What do you think, Kyle?

13:05.734 --> 13:07.767
- Hey, Sue.
- Hi!

13:07.869 --> 13:09.502
Oh.

13:09.571 --> 13:11.104
Oh! I get it.

13:11.172 --> 13:13.279
Did she have
a little too much?

13:13.388 --> 13:14.520
What? Oh. Oh, no.

13:14.589 --> 13:16.022
Uh, t-this is my girlfriend, Julia.

13:16.124 --> 13:17.690
- Julia, this is Sue.
- Hi.

13:17.759 --> 13:20.093
Oh. Hi. Hi!

13:20.195 --> 13:21.628
I like your necklace.

13:21.696 --> 13:23.363
It looks really good on your neck.

13:23.465 --> 13:24.397
Oh, thanks.

13:24.466 --> 13:25.898
Tyler gave it to me for Christmas.

13:25.934 --> 13:29.202
Oh. That's so Tyler!

13:29.271 --> 13:30.970
I always thought he was sweet and nice.

13:31.072 --> 13:34.173
And aha! He is!

13:34.242 --> 13:37.343
Well, anyway, I will hop on...

13:37.445 --> 13:38.945
I'll hop on... I'll hop on in.

13:43.752 --> 13:46.631
Well... this is...

13:46.700 --> 13:48.621
This is gonna be so much fun.

13:48.723 --> 13:51.275
Uh, I brought
some Milk Dudes in my purse

13:51.394 --> 13:53.461
if anyone wants for later.

13:58.001 --> 13:59.901
Aah!

14:01.337 --> 14:02.670
Mike!

14:02.772 --> 14:04.138
What are you doing?!

14:04.207 --> 14:06.340
Listen, I realized when we left
the office to go get a beer,

14:06.443 --> 14:08.574
- we were onthe security cam.
- So?

14:08.643 --> 14:11.446
So if Frankie sees the tape,
she'll know that we left early,

14:11.514 --> 14:14.135
and I wouldn't have had time
to do a mesial distal occlusal

14:14.168 --> 14:15.634
with slight pulp horn exposure.

14:15.703 --> 14:17.303
Look, you're way overthinking this.

14:17.372 --> 14:19.746
Why would Frankie ever look
at the security tape?

14:19.860 --> 14:21.360
Doesn't matter. I got ahead of this.

14:21.526 --> 14:23.959
I told Frankie you and I went outside

14:24.028 --> 14:25.961
because there were miscreants
in the parking lot.

14:26.030 --> 14:27.263
We wanted to see what they were up to.

14:27.365 --> 14:28.464
They ran away,

14:28.533 --> 14:30.900
but they'd broken into my car
and stole my coat.

14:31.002 --> 14:32.334
That's why I'm not wearing one now.

14:32.436 --> 14:33.769
By the way, I donated it to charity

14:33.871 --> 14:35.404
so I wouldn't mess up
and wear it to work.

14:35.506 --> 14:37.773
Wait. If Frankie was looking
at the security tape,

14:37.842 --> 14:40.308
wouldn't she wonder why
we didn't go back in

14:40.382 --> 14:41.682
and finish the procedure?

14:41.784 --> 14:44.518
Ah, ding-dangit! You're right.

14:45.921 --> 14:48.922
Okay! We can tell her
we came in the side door,

14:48.991 --> 14:50.958
because the miscreants
might still be out there.

14:51.026 --> 14:53.393
Okay, so, what's our next move?

14:53.821 --> 14:55.621
My next move is going in the house.

14:55.723 --> 14:57.589
Good idea. Act normal.

15:03.530 --> 15:05.664
Oh, hey, you're home
earlier than I expected.

15:05.766 --> 15:07.666
- How'd it go?
- Oh, it went great.

15:07.735 --> 15:09.835
We had so much fun.

15:09.903 --> 15:11.703
Me and him...

15:11.772 --> 15:13.839
and his girlfriend!

15:13.941 --> 15:15.540
What? No!

15:15.643 --> 15:17.876
Why wouldn't Tyler tell you
he had a girlfriend?

15:17.978 --> 15:19.745
I don't know, but her name is Julia,

15:19.847 --> 15:21.513
and the sad thing is, she's not awful.

15:21.615 --> 15:22.748
We shared popcorn,

15:22.850 --> 15:24.383
and she mixed in M&M'S,
which is a really good idea,

15:24.485 --> 15:25.717
and I can't believe
I haven't thought of it before,

15:25.819 --> 15:27.386
and, oh, my God, I'm so stupid!

15:27.488 --> 15:28.854
I read all his signals wrong.

15:28.922 --> 15:30.155
Tyler only thought of me as a friend.

15:30.257 --> 15:33.692
Oh, Sue. This sucks. I am so sorry.

15:33.794 --> 15:35.160
No, it's my fault, really.

15:35.262 --> 15:36.828
I talked too much
about my heavy periods.

15:36.930 --> 15:38.597
I dropped myself
right into the friend zone.

15:38.699 --> 15:39.898
Yeah, that'd do it.

15:39.900 --> 15:41.833
Uhh! I'm so embarrassed!

15:41.935 --> 15:44.569
Aurora, put sugar in my mouth.

15:44.672 --> 15:46.038
I'm sorry.

15:46.140 --> 15:47.939
I cannot process your request.

15:48.536 --> 15:50.442
Aurora can't, but I can.

15:56.337 --> 15:58.570
Well, they voted on the musical,

15:58.630 --> 15:59.729
and I lost.

15:59.798 --> 16:02.447
Which means either Cindy or Troy
did not vote for me.

16:02.706 --> 16:04.206
They went with "Carousel."

16:04.308 --> 16:06.141
- Fa-resh.
- Oh, well.

16:06.210 --> 16:08.543
At least you tried.
That's the main thing.

16:08.645 --> 16:10.697
For a Heck, that's a win.

16:10.757 --> 16:13.091
I'm telling you, it's "Orson,
The Heartland's Hidden Gem"

16:13.193 --> 16:14.125
all over again.

16:14.228 --> 16:15.861
I was so close...

16:15.929 --> 16:18.530
to have victory snatched
from my grasp like that.

16:18.599 --> 16:21.733
I guess America's just not ready
for historical Scottish rap.

16:21.835 --> 16:23.468
Boy, I read that wrong.

16:23.537 --> 16:25.637
Ah, you're just too cutting edge
for people around here.

16:25.739 --> 16:27.706
I mean, we just got a P.F. Chang's.

16:28.003 --> 16:29.702
Anyway, there's always next year.

16:29.805 --> 16:31.604
Oh, I'm not giving up on my musical.

16:31.706 --> 16:33.173
I'll be workshopping it every weekend

16:33.241 --> 16:34.474
here at the house if need be.

16:34.543 --> 16:36.443
Oh. But no bagpipe music.

16:36.511 --> 16:38.945
I-It's a whole homeowners'
association thing.

16:39.014 --> 16:40.969
That's why we can't paint the house.

16:40.994 --> 16:41.880
Hmm.

16:41.905 --> 16:45.141
Hey, why didn't you tell me

16:45.320 --> 16:47.220
about all that excitement
the other night?

16:47.322 --> 16:50.490
Oh, uh... well,
there's nothing much to tell.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.725
There were some miscreants.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.094
I'm going to bed.

16:54.162 --> 16:56.496
It's only 6:30.

16:56.565 --> 16:59.365
Pfft. It must be the medication
he's got me on, I guess.

16:59.468 --> 17:01.617
I'm babbling.

17:01.642 --> 17:03.109
Why are we talking?
I don't like talking.

17:03.177 --> 17:04.210
Good night.

17:06.380 --> 17:07.413
Oh, wait.

17:07.482 --> 17:09.321
I just remembered.
There's a security camera.

17:09.442 --> 17:11.308
We could get the footage for that night

17:11.377 --> 17:12.409
and find out who it is.

17:12.511 --> 17:15.679
Um... if you look at the tape,

17:15.781 --> 17:17.381
you won't see us
coming back in the building,

17:17.483 --> 17:18.968
'cause we came in through a side door.

17:19.056 --> 17:20.288
Didn't the alarm go off?

17:20.391 --> 17:21.890
Uh, no.

17:21.992 --> 17:23.791
Uh, Dr. Goodwin had a special key.

17:23.861 --> 17:25.827
What? That door has a keypad.

17:25.929 --> 17:27.691
Yeah. Keypad. You cut me off.

17:27.771 --> 17:29.671
So, he does have the code.

17:29.740 --> 17:30.739
I can't believe Dr. Goodwin

17:30.841 --> 17:32.808
keeps telling me
he doesn't have the code.

17:32.910 --> 17:34.109
I have to park on the side

17:34.211 --> 17:35.477
and walk all the way around
to the front,

17:35.546 --> 17:36.878
and he knows I hate walking.

17:36.980 --> 17:38.513
I'm gonna talk to him about that.

17:38.582 --> 17:40.315
Uh, you know, don't.

17:40.417 --> 17:41.783
He's having a bad week.

17:41.885 --> 17:43.518
Why do you say that?

17:44.352 --> 17:45.454
Uh...

17:48.325 --> 17:50.459
If anyone asks... your aunt died.

17:50.561 --> 17:52.294
Lilah or Pauline?

17:52.362 --> 17:54.463
Let's make it Pauline.
She's a real bitch.

17:57.334 --> 18:00.335
Well... guess this is it.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.886
This 'Bago gave us a lot of good times.

18:03.926 --> 18:07.041
And several fairly serious
recurring leg rashes.

18:07.730 --> 18:10.197
Hey, you remember that time
Kenny was sitting right there,

18:10.299 --> 18:11.699
and he laughed?

18:11.801 --> 18:13.067
Hell yeah.

18:13.169 --> 18:15.102
You don't forget Kenny's first laugh.

18:16.749 --> 18:18.015
Well, if you need me,

18:18.117 --> 18:19.816
I'm staying with
my girlfriend's cousin Ronald.

18:19.885 --> 18:21.184
His nickname is "Bear."

18:21.253 --> 18:22.886
He thinks guys bond by wrestling.

18:22.988 --> 18:25.122
Hey, it's not like this is goodbye.

18:25.190 --> 18:27.024
No, no. Of course not.

18:27.126 --> 18:29.593
We're still gonna be seeing
a lot of each other.

18:29.695 --> 18:31.061
Oh, sure. Sure.

18:31.130 --> 18:33.781
I mean, weren't we gonna have to
do this in three months anyway?

18:37.903 --> 18:40.370
That's three more
months we could have had together.

18:46.737 --> 18:48.603
Frankie, listen, I forgot to tell you...

18:48.936 --> 18:51.470
Dr. Goodwin isn't gonna leave
for his aunt's funeral

18:51.539 --> 18:55.707
until Tuesday 'cause he's got
to stop at the vet first.

18:55.809 --> 18:58.277
Good idea. Tell her that.
You're a genius.

18:58.379 --> 19:00.145
Aah!

19:01.826 --> 19:04.316
Drill it! Drill the hell out of it.

19:17.016 --> 19:18.048
I got it back.

19:18.150 --> 19:19.116
Yeah, I see.

19:19.218 --> 19:20.184
Now we're gonna have to rehearse

19:20.286 --> 19:21.318
what we're gonna say to the police?

19:21.387 --> 19:22.920
Nah, it's cool.

19:22.988 --> 19:24.221
How'd you get it back?

19:24.323 --> 19:26.290
I just told those guys that
they're now legally responsible

19:26.392 --> 19:28.425
for all the 40 parking tickets
we left unpaid.

19:28.494 --> 19:29.560
No, they're not.

19:29.662 --> 19:31.962
They don't know that,
but as a law student, I do.

19:32.064 --> 19:33.097
You're not a law student.

19:33.199 --> 19:34.331
They don't know that, either.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.150
Now we're gonna take this thing
down to the quad

19:36.252 --> 19:38.035
and throw the most epic rager
in the history of East Indy!

19:38.479 --> 19:39.678
Wiggly-guy high five.

19:39.780 --> 19:41.413
Whoa!

19:44.785 --> 19:47.786
Sue. Hey, Sue!

19:48.248 --> 19:49.748
Sue. Hey! Wait up.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.540
It's okay. I don't need a ride now.

19:51.642 --> 19:52.941
The walking helps my cramps,

19:53.043 --> 19:54.476
but I've already shared too much.

19:54.578 --> 19:55.644
Sue, stop.

19:55.746 --> 19:57.546
I need to talk to you. It's important.

19:57.648 --> 19:59.247
My girlfriend broke up with me.

20:00.651 --> 20:01.850
What? Why?

20:01.952 --> 20:03.785
Julia thinks I might like another girl,

20:03.887 --> 20:05.921
and she's not wrong.

20:06.023 --> 20:07.439
Oh, my God.

20:07.508 --> 20:08.890
There's another one?!

20:08.992 --> 20:10.058
You are sick!

20:10.160 --> 20:12.394
You have a girlfriend,
you like another girl,

20:12.463 --> 20:14.196
and, I'm sorry,
but it seems like you were being

20:14.298 --> 20:15.831
a little bit flirty with me.

20:15.933 --> 20:18.266
So if you were looking
for a woman friend

20:18.368 --> 20:19.901
to talk about
your relationship problems,

20:20.003 --> 20:21.369
I am not going down that road again.

20:21.472 --> 20:22.971
Sue. Sue.

20:23.073 --> 20:24.306
I do like another girl.

20:30.047 --> 20:31.313
Really?

20:31.415 --> 20:33.115
Yeah, Julia pointed out
that at the movies,

20:33.217 --> 20:35.050
I spent the whole time
looking at someone else.

20:35.152 --> 20:37.853
Oh. Hmm.

20:41.391 --> 20:43.425
Just to be clear, it's me, right?

20:45.095 --> 20:47.963
Okay, but if you could just
put it into words so I could...

20:48.065 --> 20:49.331
Sue...

20:49.433 --> 20:50.499
it's you.

21:00.902 --> 21:01.968
Bagpipe beatbox!

21:05.574 --> 21:07.974
How many more hours till I can
take another pain pill?

21:08.076 --> 21:09.209
You just took one.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.844
Damn.
