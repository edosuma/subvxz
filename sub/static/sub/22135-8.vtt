00:01.835 --> 00:03.204
Family is the ultimate power
on The Gifted.

00:03.237 --> 00:05.573
A lot of people
have been fighting this fight
for a long time,

00:05.606 --> 00:07.141
and now it's our turn.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.976
Catch all-new episodes Mondays.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.711
And check out our other
Fox programs-- The Orville,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.546
Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.715
Gotham needs more people
who are willing
to fight for her.

00:14.748 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.553
Pulse, it's me.
(groans)

00:20.554 --> 00:22.390
-(grunting) -ECLIPSE:
There are rumors of mutants

00:22.423 --> 00:24.358
hunting other mutants
for Sentinel Services.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.394
Reed Strucker worked
with a judge at the courthouse.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.496
If we break in, we might be
able to figure out what

00:28.529 --> 00:29.863
-the hell's going on. -It looks
like it's mostly information

00:29.897 --> 00:31.999
on mutants who were sent
to Trask Industries.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.268
Whatever this is,
they're behind it.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.304
My father worked there
for 35 years.

00:37.305 --> 00:38.739
CARMEN:
I call,

00:38.772 --> 00:40.074
you come,

00:40.108 --> 00:44.011
and you do
exactly what I ask you to do.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.379
ECLIPSE:
I did this for you

00:45.413 --> 00:46.314
and for our baby.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.216
Lorna.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.550
Your friend Dreamer

00:49.583 --> 00:50.884
stuck a memory in my head.

00:50.918 --> 00:52.286
I've got my own issues
to sort out.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.721
You're tough to track,
you know that?

00:53.754 --> 00:54.755
BLINK:
Remember when I got sick?

00:54.788 --> 00:56.090
I kept
trying to portal to that road?

00:56.124 --> 00:57.057
Let me help you find it.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.092
BLINK:
That's the farmhouse.

00:58.892 --> 00:59.727
Carl? Denise?

00:59.760 --> 01:02.230
Clarice, I'm sorry.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.298
JACE: I don't just want them!
Shut down every safe house,

01:04.332 --> 01:07.235
every sympathizer, anyone who's
ever helped 'em. I want 'em all!

01:07.268 --> 01:09.570
I hear you're working
with a Dr. Campbell?

01:09.603 --> 01:11.605
He runs a program
that officially doesn't exist.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.608
I'm requesting a court order
if you don't... (coughs)

01:14.642 --> 01:16.277
CAMPBELL: We've started
with the assets who can target

01:16.310 --> 01:17.211
the Underground immediately.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.379
Don't think of 'em as spies.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.448
More like weapons.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.583
We may finally be in a position
to win this war.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.520
(man singing operatically)

01:30.023 --> 01:32.360
*

01:54.348 --> 01:56.284
(phone ringing)

02:02.856 --> 02:05.326
-(tires screeching in distance)
-Hello?

02:07.195 --> 02:09.630
WOMAN:
What's wrong?

02:09.663 --> 02:10.931
What happened?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.132
They found us, sister.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.234
-(crashing)
-MAN: Interpol!

02:15.403 --> 02:16.304
Quick!

02:16.337 --> 02:17.905
You're under arrest.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.712
Pity. I liked this place.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.719
(agents screaming)

02:33.654 --> 02:35.556
*

02:42.996 --> 02:44.898
Hey, guys.
So, we need to talk,

02:44.932 --> 02:47.368
and I know it's late,
but I just learned something

02:47.401 --> 02:50.371
and it's important that
you hear about it from me.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.705
What's going on?

02:51.739 --> 02:53.006
Yeah, you're kind of
freaking me out.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.542
You know we've been looking into

02:54.575 --> 02:56.710
the Sentinel Services program

02:56.744 --> 03:00.047
that's turning mutants
into weapons against other...

03:00.080 --> 03:02.483
well, against all of us here.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.818
Yeah, you were searching
those computer drives.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.086
You found something?

03:06.119 --> 03:07.521
I'm afraid so.

03:07.555 --> 03:10.258
Sentinel Services have been
working with

03:10.291 --> 03:12.993
a defense contractor
called Trask Industries.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.662
CAITLIN:
Wait.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.097
The same Trask Industries
where your father worked?

03:17.130 --> 03:19.733
REED:
Yeah.

03:19.767 --> 03:22.336
ANDY: You said
Grandpa disappeared years ago.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.837
That he ran out
on you and Grandma.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.773
That's not entirely true.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.176
He lives up in Chattanooga.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.344
That's only two hours away.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.446
We've never even met him.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.914
Okay, that was intentional.

03:33.947 --> 03:37.050
He wasn't good to your father,
growing up.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.519
He's a difficult man.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.688
He was always working,
he was never home.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.189
We weren't close.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.692
I got sick when I was a kid.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.261
I almost died, and...

03:47.295 --> 03:49.763
he didn't even bother
to come to the hospital.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.798
Harsh.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.802
REED: I haven't spoken
to him since before

03:54.835 --> 03:56.169
you guys were born.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.108
Well, I think you're going
to need to speak to him now.

04:02.643 --> 04:05.713
(blade whisks through air,
powers whirr)

04:05.746 --> 04:07.648
ECLIPSE:
I hate it when you do that.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.354
You coming to bed?

04:14.488 --> 04:15.956
I thought I'd sleep here.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.058
Lorna, we can't go on like this.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.960
Ask your ex-girlfriend
from the cartel.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.062
-Maybe she can help.
-Babe.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.298
I went to Carmen to save you.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.733
Part of the deal
was working for her.

04:25.766 --> 04:26.934
What was I supposed to do?

04:26.967 --> 04:28.068
You could've started

04:28.101 --> 04:29.136
by not enjoying it so much.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.306
I saw you with her, Marcos.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.942
I saw the look on your face
as you torched that truck.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.544
I saw her kiss you
when you were done.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.581
(scoffs)

04:40.614 --> 04:43.317
We are already in a war.

04:43.351 --> 04:44.952
You want to start another one
with the cartel?

04:44.985 --> 04:46.186
With a baby on the way?

04:46.219 --> 04:48.622
How are we supposed
to raise a baby?

04:48.656 --> 04:50.458
Our world is falling apart.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.993
We do it together.
That's it.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.996
Whatever happens...

04:56.029 --> 04:58.265
we can protect it.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.801
We can barely protect ourselves.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.138
Lorna...

05:13.013 --> 05:16.684
(birds singing)

05:16.717 --> 05:19.119
We're going to need to talk
to the folks in Gainesville,

05:19.152 --> 05:20.354
make sure they're ready
for more refugees.

05:20.388 --> 05:21.555
I'm on it.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.192
Hey, John, can I have a word?

05:26.827 --> 05:28.962
We need to go see my father
in Chattanooga.

05:28.996 --> 05:32.199
I know it's a risk, but he is
our only connection to Trask.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.801
You think he'll know something?

05:33.834 --> 05:34.968
Maybe, maybe not.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.504
We don't have much choice.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.038
(sighs)

05:38.071 --> 05:40.007
The station in Perry just fell.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.675
We're going to pick up
survivors now.

05:41.709 --> 05:42.843
You prep a car, some supplies.

05:42.876 --> 05:43.777
We'll leave
as soon as I get back.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.085
Clarice is getting
the cars ready.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.754
Clarice?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.723
Lorna's not coming, man.

05:55.756 --> 05:56.924
Is something wrong?

05:56.957 --> 05:58.659
Everything's fine.

05:58.692 --> 06:02.062
Marcos, a problem between
you two affects everyone.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.096
You're both leaders
at this station...

06:03.130 --> 06:05.833
She's just not coming, okay?

06:05.866 --> 06:08.035
All right.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.610
Hey.

06:16.644 --> 06:19.279
I know things have been awkward
since you got back.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.381
I hope there's no hard feelings
between us.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.852
Well, I'm going to have
to disappoint you.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.787
I'm only here for one reason:

06:26.820 --> 06:28.522
my foster parents
were slaughtered

06:28.556 --> 06:30.624
by the Sentinel Services
and I'm gonna fight back.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.561
This is a war.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.463
And we're on the same side.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.631
It's the only relationship
we need.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.767
(engine starts)

06:51.912 --> 06:53.413
MAN:
Grateful you came so quick.

06:53.447 --> 06:56.116
Sentinel Services
is even coming after us now.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.085
So much for sanctuary.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.753
How many refugees are there?

06:59.787 --> 07:02.422
A dozen fled here when
the station in Perry got hit.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.458
Plus a few strays.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.059
Let's load them up.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.095
I just have to hide them in here
during services.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.863
I got you, Padre.

07:18.706 --> 07:19.840
PASTOR:
It's all right.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.074
These are friends.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.175
They'll get you to safety.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.777
-(murmuring)
-Wow.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.779
Toss your stuff in the back,
grab a seat, quick as you can.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.314
We'll brief you on everything
once we get where we're going.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.153
ECLIPSE:
You want to keep it?

07:33.186 --> 07:34.688
Here you go.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.627
BLINK:
Hey.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.328
You okay?

07:41.361 --> 07:43.096
It's all right.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.798
Come on. I got you.

07:48.368 --> 07:49.703
WOMAN:
Hey.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.505
I need to talk to you.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.974
-What is it?
-I'm a telepath.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.043
I can sense thoughts,
if I'm close enough,

07:56.076 --> 07:57.444
and I've been getting
some very weird thoughts

07:57.477 --> 07:59.046
from one of the others.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.949
-The big guy there?
-Not him.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.216
Her.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.855
Excuse me. Ma'am?

08:07.888 --> 08:10.357
What's your name?

08:10.390 --> 08:11.892
Hey.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.464
(groans)

08:17.497 --> 08:18.265
(grunts)

08:20.333 --> 08:21.168
Everybody, get down!

08:24.705 --> 08:25.573
(boy screams)

08:32.546 --> 08:34.381
-Can you get me above her?
-Go!

08:49.797 --> 08:50.898
-Stay down. -WOMAN: We got you.
-THUNDERBIRD: Stop!

09:00.207 --> 09:01.341
DREAMER:
So she was sent as a spy?

09:01.374 --> 09:02.509
ECLIPSE:
Something between a spy

09:02.542 --> 09:03.844
and a suicide bomber.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.579
She had a beacon in her bag
she could've activated

09:05.613 --> 09:06.880
when we brought her in.

09:06.914 --> 09:07.881
It would've sent
Sentinel Services

09:07.915 --> 09:09.116
right to our front door.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.283
She had weapons, too.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.620
Yeah, it sounds like
the station in Perry

09:12.653 --> 09:14.988
was hit by another one of these,
uh, things.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.092
SAGE:
If Sentinel Services is planting

09:19.126 --> 09:21.261
these things out there, we may
need to stop taking in refugees.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.796
THUNDERBIRD:
You don't turn your back

09:22.830 --> 09:25.565
on desperate people because
one of them might be dangerous.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.736
Reed--

09:28.769 --> 09:30.137
We should get on the road.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.972
Try and figure out
whatever we can from your dad

09:32.005 --> 09:34.141
-before it's too late.
-Yeah.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.308
Hey, what about
Little Miss Vicious?

09:35.342 --> 09:37.310
THUNDERBIRD: We got to get
what we can out of her.

09:37.344 --> 09:40.113
See if you can figure out
who she is.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.182
Do you think
you can handle this?

09:43.516 --> 09:44.818
Yeah.

09:44.852 --> 09:46.954
We'll be fine.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.332
-REED (quietly): Hey.
-ANDY: See you.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.200
Bye, baby.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.771
I should be going with you.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.673
I know how hard
this is gonna be,

10:05.706 --> 10:07.607
to see your dad
after all this time,

10:07.641 --> 10:10.310
all the disappointments and...
and the arguments...

10:10.343 --> 10:13.580
I can cross-examine
a murder suspect,

10:13.613 --> 10:15.582
but the thought of having
a conversation with my father

10:15.615 --> 10:17.818
for the first time
in 20 years... I...

10:17.851 --> 10:20.587
I'm proud of you.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.856
Look, if talking to him
helps protect us all from...

10:22.890 --> 10:24.457
this threat, then...

10:24.491 --> 10:26.226
it's a small price to pay.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.863
I'll keep them safe.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.164
I love you.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.302
I love you.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.911
(sighs)

10:46.814 --> 10:48.381
Hey, are you okay?

10:55.388 --> 10:56.957
My name's Clarice.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.458
What's your name?

10:58.491 --> 11:01.061
-Norah.
-Norah.

11:01.094 --> 11:04.164
It was pretty rough back there.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.365
I know.

11:05.398 --> 11:08.335
Do you want to talk about it?

11:11.338 --> 11:16.009
If you change your mind,
my bunk's right down there.

11:16.043 --> 11:17.010
Okay.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.946
Here. In case you get cold.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.265
Okay. It's gonna get worse
for a second,

11:38.298 --> 11:39.532
and then it's gonna get better.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.001
-I have to pop it back in.
-Hey.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.102
Want to look at me?

11:42.135 --> 11:43.403
Bite down on this.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.404
Really hard, okay?

11:44.437 --> 11:47.074
Three, two, one.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.208
-(elbow pops)
-(muffled scream)

11:48.241 --> 11:49.209
All right.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.610
There you go.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.179
All done. Better?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.580
All right, move your fingers.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.415
Hmm?

11:55.448 --> 11:56.449
Move your nose.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.450
(Caitlin and boy laugh)

11:57.484 --> 11:58.585
All right.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.353
I think you're gonna be okay.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.721
-You got that?
-Mm-hmm.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.257
-Let's get him a sling.
-Yeah, a sling.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.693
Okay, you're in good hands.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.229
Good job.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.630
Yo, I'm Andy.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.532
We're gonna sing
the sling song, okay?

12:12.565 --> 12:13.967
Join in anytime.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.602
(beatboxing)

12:15.635 --> 12:16.636
* Sling...

12:16.669 --> 12:17.938
Let's see it. Okay.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.807
Let's see what
we're working with here.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.408
It's really nothing.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.710
-I mean, if you need to help
someone else or... -No.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.813
It's your turn.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.215
Um, I'm afraid you're gonna
need some stitches.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.484
Keep some pressure on that.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.954
I heard you were
a bit of a hero today.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.589
You're psychic?

12:36.623 --> 12:39.126
Yeah. Uh, sort of.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.560
I'm a telepath.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.063
I can feel thoughts
if I'm close.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.799
Is that right?

12:45.833 --> 12:47.935
How about me?

12:53.807 --> 12:57.577
You're... concerned.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.113
About what's going on
between mutants and humans.

13:00.147 --> 13:04.484
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
everyone's concerned about that.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.486
And you don't want
you and your husband

13:06.519 --> 13:08.989
to end up on the opposite side
as your kids.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.093
Sorry.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.195
Uh, I don't mean to pry.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.197
Uh...

13:17.230 --> 13:19.833
No. (chuckles)

13:19.867 --> 13:22.035
Just don't go looking into
my college experimentations.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.503
It's a deal.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.138
(both chuckle)

13:25.172 --> 13:27.440
All right, well,
now that you've read my mind,

13:27.474 --> 13:30.010
I feel like I should
at least get your name.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.511
I'm Esme.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.513
-Hey.
-Hi.

13:33.546 --> 13:34.647
(both chuckle)

13:36.549 --> 13:39.186
And, um, just so you know...

13:40.687 --> 13:42.689
...people value you around here.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.057
(Esme chuckles softly)

13:48.661 --> 13:49.796
POLARIS:
She won't talk to us.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.564
Just smoke her.
Get whatever memories you can.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.733
DREAMER: I really don't think
this is gonna work.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.068
POLARIS:
One way to find out.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.542
DREAMER: I'm not good
at hitting moving targets.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.344
Even if she breathed it in,

14:04.377 --> 14:08.148
I think her metabolism is
too fast for me to get anything.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.082
(Polaris sighs)

14:12.452 --> 14:14.554
Yeah, so you're fast,
but you don't have

14:14.587 --> 14:16.189
eyes in the back of your head.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.590
You gonna talk to us?

14:17.624 --> 14:19.259
Lorna! What are you doing?

14:19.292 --> 14:20.860
Just letting her know
we're serious.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.562
ECLIPSE: You think she's gonna
talk to you if you stab her?

14:22.595 --> 14:23.931
Put the knives down.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.238
Is this a joke?

14:31.271 --> 14:32.339
-What?
-Weren't you the inquisitor

14:32.372 --> 14:33.873
for your cartel friends?

14:33.907 --> 14:35.175
What, it's okay
when you do it for Carmen,

14:35.208 --> 14:37.077
-but it's not okay for us?
-It's not...

14:37.110 --> 14:38.245
Look, it's hard to explain.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.679
It seems like a lot of things

14:39.712 --> 14:41.848
are hard for you to explain
these days.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.483
Lorna...

14:48.088 --> 14:49.856
It's just up here.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.458
Your father runs
an antique store?

14:51.491 --> 14:52.759
Thought he was a scientist.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.461
He took it over when he retired.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.429
He's big on living in the past.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.967
That's it.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.273
(music box playing)

15:11.278 --> 15:12.912
(doorbells jingle)

15:21.754 --> 15:24.124
Reed.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.259
Hello.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.800
I never thought
I'd see you again.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.635
Well, I'm here.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.004
We need to talk.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.611
Listen, I want information
as much as you do.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.146
Then why won't you
help us get it?

15:46.179 --> 15:47.280
We're running out of time.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.681
She's not talking.
You can make her talk.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.850
-It's not that simple, okay?
-That right?

15:50.883 --> 15:52.652
From what I've heard about
what you used to do,

15:52.685 --> 15:54.287
it sounded pretty simple.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.189
Lorna, one of the reasons
I joined the Underground

15:56.223 --> 15:59.326
in the first place is so I don't
have to do that kind of thing.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.428
I mean, you're asking me
to burn someone.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.031
Now, I got enough
nightmares as it is.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.798
-She tried to kill us.
-I know that.

16:05.832 --> 16:08.001
But believe me, when you start
down this road, it gets ugly.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.537
Look, I know you're mad.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.106
I know you're mad
that I went to Carmen.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.343
I was not gonna leave you
out there and let them do...

16:16.376 --> 16:18.878
-that... to you.
-They're gonna do that

16:18.911 --> 16:21.614
to all of us if we don't
figure something out.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.783
Me, you and the baby.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.285
Babe, don't-don't ever say that.

16:25.318 --> 16:28.521
-You...
-(cell bars clank)

16:28.555 --> 16:31.191
ECLIPSE: Hang on.
There might be something.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.726
-You see how she's acting?
-Screwing up her manicure?

16:33.760 --> 16:37.230
One thing I saw a lot of with
the cartel was drug addicts.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.832
-Do you think
she's on something? -Yeah.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.801
Yeah, I do.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.537
CAITLIN: I can't be sure
without examining her,

16:44.571 --> 16:46.573
but you could be right.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.841
She's got all the symptoms
of withdrawal.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.843
Have you ever seen
a mutant on Kick?

16:50.877 --> 16:53.646
-Um, what's Kick?
-LAUREN: It's a mutant drug.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.348
I read about it.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.817
Boosts your powers for a while.
Makes you feel invincible.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.219
Yeah, and it gets you hooked

16:59.252 --> 17:00.587
before you even know
what hit you.

17:00.620 --> 17:01.821
CAITLIN:
Well, if that's the case,

17:01.854 --> 17:03.323
we might be able to treat her.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.325
Wait a second.
We're treating her?

17:05.358 --> 17:07.927
Why don't we just bring her a
fruit basket while we're at it?

17:07.960 --> 17:09.996
If we treat her, she might be
willing to cooperate.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.731
Yeah, or she might just
get stronger and try to

17:11.764 --> 17:13.566
-kill us all again. -Can you
just listen for one second?

17:13.600 --> 17:15.702
-Could you not be...
-Stop it! Both of you.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.670
Let's try to remember,
we're fighting for

17:17.704 --> 17:20.006
a world where people can
actually live together.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.842
That starts here.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.512
(sighs)

17:25.545 --> 17:27.780
Now we just have to figure out
a way to restrain her.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.424
She likes you.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.194
You know, Zingo--

17:41.228 --> 17:43.330
she's pretty particular
about the people she likes.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.303
She likes me, too.

17:50.337 --> 17:51.871
You know why?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.940
It's 'cause we're special.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.942
We are.

17:55.975 --> 17:58.711
There's a lot of folks in here
that just walk around,

17:58.745 --> 18:00.247
you can't even tell
they're mutants.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.714
But not us.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.716
I got my eyes, my ears,

18:03.750 --> 18:06.919
you have your skin, and
Zingo here is covered in fur.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.389
You're covered all in hair,
aren't you, Zingo?

18:09.422 --> 18:10.323
Yeah.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.061
How'd you end up here?

18:15.094 --> 18:17.330
I mean, at the church.

18:21.634 --> 18:24.237
Mama D and I
were making dinner...

18:24.271 --> 18:26.105
Mama D?

18:29.842 --> 18:32.412
Norah, were you at the
foster home on Burnhill Road?

18:32.445 --> 18:33.846
Yes.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.785
The men with the guns...

18:38.818 --> 18:41.020
they came.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.091
I wanted to help.

18:45.124 --> 18:49.296
Every time...

18:49.329 --> 18:52.765
I go to bed, I see them.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.201
I'm sorry.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.371
I'm so sorry.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.814
You should have called.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.650
I would have told you
not to waste your time.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.885
Who is this?

19:12.919 --> 19:16.523
My name's John Proudstar,
Thunderbird.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.525
Ah, Thunderbird.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.227
Very heroic.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.562
REED: He's with
the Mutant Underground.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.031
-They've been helping my family.
-OTTO: Is that so?

19:25.064 --> 19:28.635
The men from Sentinel Services
came by.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.205
They seemed to think they were
a terrorist organization.

19:32.239 --> 19:34.040
-We're not terrorists, sir.
-No, no.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.843
Of course not.
Freedom fighters, I'm sure.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.878
We're not here to have
a political debate.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.380
(sighs)

19:40.413 --> 19:42.249
Did you hear what happened?

19:42.282 --> 19:44.217
At the school? Yes.

19:44.251 --> 19:46.419
They told me about it
when they interrogated me.

19:46.453 --> 19:49.055
What'd you tell them?

19:49.088 --> 19:53.192
That I never met
my grandchildren

19:53.226 --> 19:56.062
and haven't spoken
to my son in years.

19:56.095 --> 19:58.765
In other words, the truth.

19:58.798 --> 20:03.370
We need to talk to you
about your work at Trask.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.104
My work at Trask was classified.

20:05.137 --> 20:07.106
I'm your son.

20:07.139 --> 20:10.109
Son or not, it's a crime to
reveal classified intelligence.

20:10.142 --> 20:14.080
It's also a crime
to harbor a fugitive.

20:14.113 --> 20:16.549
I assume they covered this
in law school.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.118
My kids are being hunted
by Sentinel Services.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.921
This has nothing to do with me.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.257
-I have nothing to say.
-You said for years

20:24.291 --> 20:26.759
that Trask was just
a defense contractor.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.395
Trask no longer exists.
I don't have any...

20:28.428 --> 20:29.929
It opened up again!

20:29.962 --> 20:33.400
And they are doing
anti-mutant research.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.469
Now, you worked there
for 30 years.

20:36.503 --> 20:38.305
And it just turns out
that your grandchildren

20:38.338 --> 20:40.106
happen to be mutants.

20:40.139 --> 20:42.875
Do you expect me to believe
that that's a coincidence?

20:42.909 --> 20:45.478
They're experimenting
on mutants.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.146
My own best friend
was turned, somehow.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.248
He's working for
Sentinel Services.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.453
REED:
Dad...

20:53.486 --> 20:54.854
I need you.

20:58.991 --> 21:02.395
Come.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.297
Upstairs.

21:08.535 --> 21:09.936
THUNDERBIRD:
It's all right.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.871
Go.

21:30.022 --> 21:33.292
Your mother, Ellen, is she...?

21:33.326 --> 21:35.194
She's fine.
She's still in Atlanta.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.464
We see her, um... well,

21:37.497 --> 21:40.433
we used to see her
every couple of weeks.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.701
I miss her, you know.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.606
Does she know about all this?

21:46.639 --> 21:49.275
Some, yeah.
They questioned her.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.043
Ah.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.278
The children,

21:52.311 --> 21:55.882
how old are they?

21:55.915 --> 21:58.651
Andy's 15 and...

21:58.685 --> 22:01.621
Lauren just turned 17.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.356
May I...

22:03.390 --> 22:05.191
may I see them?
You have a...

22:05.224 --> 22:07.293
a photograph of something?

22:07.326 --> 22:10.363
I do, actually.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.001
This was taken last summer.

22:17.770 --> 22:21.240
Look, we don't have much time.

22:21.273 --> 22:24.210
Anything that you could
tell me about Trask?

22:24.243 --> 22:27.814
There's nothing to tell.
My research was peaceful.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.716
This project, whatever it is,

22:29.749 --> 22:31.884
-isn't my fault.
-This isn't about blame.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.853
My family are fighting
for their lives.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.422
OTTO:
I told you, I don't know.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.356
I know I didn't
mean much to you,

22:37.390 --> 22:38.491
but the kids
mean everything to me...

22:38.525 --> 22:40.527
Don't you dare say that!

22:40.560 --> 22:44.531
Everything I did in my life
was for you. Everything.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.966
What?

22:50.637 --> 22:53.406
The children... their powers.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.908
What can they do?

22:55.942 --> 22:58.878
Uh... (sighs)

22:58.911 --> 23:01.881
Lauren makes shields.

23:01.914 --> 23:04.283
Shields?
What do you mean "shields"?

23:04.316 --> 23:06.853
She says it's like
pushing the air together.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.088
And the other one?
The boy, Andy?

23:09.121 --> 23:10.557
He kind of tears things apart.

23:10.590 --> 23:17.263
Oh, God. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

23:17.296 --> 23:18.798
Dad?

23:18.831 --> 23:20.066
What is it?

23:20.099 --> 23:22.168
I failed.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.005
It came back.

23:32.278 --> 23:33.279
SS AGENT:
You're sure? All right.

23:33.312 --> 23:35.748
Keep me posted
if things change.

23:35.782 --> 23:36.816
What's the situation?

23:36.849 --> 23:38.284
They've searched the entire area

23:38.317 --> 23:40.119
around Eternal Grace Church,
sir.

23:40.152 --> 23:43.222
The asset is gone, and her
surveillance beacon is inactive.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.757
And the mutants?

23:44.791 --> 23:47.293
There were signs of a struggle,
but... I'm sorry.

23:47.326 --> 23:49.762
-Damn it. -Sir, if you're
worried about the asset...

23:49.796 --> 23:52.164
With the mental conditioning,
she can't tell them anything.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.900
They're mutants--
she may not have to.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.402
They're wounded; wounded animals
do desperate things.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.138
We have to assume
we've been compromised.

23:59.171 --> 24:02.141
Contact headquarters, tell them
I need an additional asset.

24:02.174 --> 24:03.976
We're going on a road trip.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.278
We're not giving up
on this search just yet.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.983
Mom, you said she needs to be
restrained, right?

24:11.017 --> 24:13.119
We can restrain her.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.954
Yeah, if I can push her
against the bars,

24:14.987 --> 24:16.823
she can hold her back
with a shield, and you can

24:16.856 --> 24:18.791
give her the sleep juice
or whatever.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.993
(sighs) All right.

24:21.027 --> 24:22.294
Let's get this over with.

24:26.165 --> 24:27.534
I'm just guessing on the dosage.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.168
Hopefully, this knocks her out,
but if something goes wrong...

24:29.201 --> 24:30.637
We'll all be ready.

24:30.670 --> 24:31.838
(sighs): Okay.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.842
(bars banging)

24:41.881 --> 24:42.849
ANDY:
Lauren, now!

24:42.882 --> 24:44.717
I got her. Go!

24:50.590 --> 24:52.925
Okay. Okay.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.163
(panting)

24:59.832 --> 25:02.134
Well, that was exciting.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.671
(welder crackling)

25:20.286 --> 25:21.854
LAUREN:
She looks so small.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.022
Yeah, for real.
Is she gonna be okay?

25:23.055 --> 25:24.256
She's used to

25:24.290 --> 25:26.192
massive doses of this drug
they're giving her.

25:26.225 --> 25:29.862
This'll help,
but I don't know for how long.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.664
I think she's dying.

25:31.698 --> 25:34.100
Well, if that's true, she's got
no reason to give us anything.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.868
CAITLIN:
Mm, you'd be surprised.

25:35.902 --> 25:39.939
I once treated a gang member
with a fatal gunshot wound.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.008
As he was dying, he told
the cops everything he'd done,

25:42.041 --> 25:44.410
just to get it off his chest.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.247
We have to hope
she's in there, somewhere.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.221
OTTO: There's something
you need to see.

25:55.254 --> 25:58.057
It's better you know everything.

26:01.093 --> 26:05.431
This is my father,
Andreas von Strucker.

26:05.464 --> 26:09.535
My father and his sister Andrea
did unspeakable things.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.970
They were terrorists.

26:12.772 --> 26:15.241
They were also mutants.

26:21.513 --> 26:23.315
This was all them?

26:23.349 --> 26:26.285
All of it... and more.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.287
What could they do?

26:28.320 --> 26:33.259
Apart, they had the same
abilities as your children.

26:33.292 --> 26:36.395
Together, though...

26:36.428 --> 26:40.166
they were known as Fenris.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.801
The Wolf.

26:41.834 --> 26:45.604
And they were more powerful
than you can imagine.

26:46.973 --> 26:50.977
(sighs) Wait.
If they were mutants...

26:51.010 --> 26:52.311
Yes, Reed.

26:52.344 --> 26:55.748
Your children's mutations
were inherited.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.350
I am a mutant.

27:01.487 --> 27:02.955
Wha...?

27:02.989 --> 27:05.024
-It's not possible.
-Please,

27:05.057 --> 27:06.993
just let me finish.

27:07.026 --> 27:11.630
They tried to raise me to be
like them, but I ran away.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.365
REED:
That's you?

27:13.399 --> 27:16.468
OTTO:
I hid my powers from everyone,

27:16.502 --> 27:17.804
even your mother.

27:17.837 --> 27:20.372
You have to understand,

27:20.406 --> 27:22.508
our family's abilities
set us apart,

27:22.541 --> 27:24.376
even from other mutants.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.979
It was too much.
I had to stop it.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.848
How could you possibly stop it?

27:28.881 --> 27:32.384
That was what
brought me to Trask--

27:32.418 --> 27:35.788
a research project
to eliminate the X-Gene.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.990
I never found what they wanted--

27:38.024 --> 27:41.360
a serum that worked
on all mutants--

27:41.393 --> 27:45.832
but I made a version
that worked on one mutant

27:45.865 --> 27:48.534
and gave it to you.

27:51.603 --> 27:54.073
(softly):
Wait.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.742
When I, when I was sick?

27:55.775 --> 27:57.209
Was that...

27:57.243 --> 28:00.679
It had to be done before
any powers manifested.

28:06.552 --> 28:09.922
Dad, I-I... I nearly died.

28:09.956 --> 28:12.524
OTTO:
You were in such pain.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.528
I hated myself.

28:18.865 --> 28:22.701
I could never look you
in the eye after that.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.605
And all of it...

28:29.541 --> 28:31.277
...for nothing.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.618
HULKING MUTANT:
Are you people crazy?

28:39.651 --> 28:41.287
-Taking her out of the cage?
-I get it, you're upset.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.421
But just stay back, okay?

28:42.454 --> 28:44.290
I don't understand
why that thing

28:44.323 --> 28:45.758
is even here.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.860
-She gets loose, she can
kill everyone. -They need to

28:47.894 --> 28:49.695
figure out who she is
and where she came from.

28:49.728 --> 28:50.696
We need to keep everyone safe.

28:50.729 --> 28:51.864
We'll be safe when she's back

28:51.898 --> 28:53.065
in a cage where she belongs.

28:53.099 --> 28:55.067
Hey. Back off.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.903
-It's okay, Andy. -No,
this guy has something to say,

28:56.936 --> 28:58.304
he'll say it to me. Right?

29:02.975 --> 29:04.476
(rumbling)

29:10.416 --> 29:12.318
Okay, cool off.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.453
Just...

29:14.486 --> 29:17.289
tell them to be careful
down there.

29:17.323 --> 29:21.994
-We will.
-All right, let's cool it, man.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.229
Thanks.

29:23.262 --> 29:26.165
No problem. You're my sister.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.867
Nobody talks to you
like that but me.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.439
SAGE: I found something
on the hard drives

29:33.472 --> 29:34.573
we got in Baton Rouge.

29:34.606 --> 29:38.510
I might know who she is...
or was.

29:38.544 --> 29:41.480
Okay, so Miss Vicious
is named Chloe?

29:41.513 --> 29:42.849
ECLIPSE:
Well, anything of use?

29:42.882 --> 29:46.118
Maybe. She used to live in a
trailer park outside of Jasper.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.586
Her kid got sick,

29:47.619 --> 29:49.755
and the pediatrician
wouldn't treat mutants.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.690
She destroyed
the doctor's office,

29:51.723 --> 29:53.292
got busted by Sentinel Services.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.965
(gasping)

29:58.998 --> 30:00.599
CAITLIN:
Chloe?

30:00.632 --> 30:02.869
Chloe, can you hear me?

30:02.902 --> 30:06.638
Chloe, I-I need you
to listen to me.

30:06.672 --> 30:08.374
We-we need to...

30:08.407 --> 30:10.442
-It's not safe. -We're not
gonna get through to her

30:10.476 --> 30:11.810
if we treat her like an animal.

30:19.919 --> 30:23.822
Chloe, we know you were arrested
by the Sentinel Services.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.657
What did they do to you?

30:25.691 --> 30:28.227
I...

30:28.260 --> 30:30.362
Look, hey, it's okay.

30:33.332 --> 30:36.735
Please. Talk to us,
we want to help.

30:36.768 --> 30:38.704
-(gasps) Uh...
-CAITLIN: Okay.

30:38.737 --> 30:40.139
Try to relax, just...

30:40.172 --> 30:42.208
Just tell us what you can.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.378
I think she wants
to communicate,

30:46.412 --> 30:47.713
but I don't,
I don't think she can talk.

30:47.746 --> 30:48.814
What do you mean,
she can't talk?

30:48.847 --> 30:49.982
I don't know.

30:50.016 --> 30:51.884
It could be physical,

30:51.918 --> 30:53.685
it could be some sort
of mental block.

30:53.719 --> 30:55.787
What the hell do we do?

30:58.224 --> 31:00.759
The telepath. (stammers)

31:00.792 --> 31:02.428
Esme, she read her mind before.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.763
Maybe-maybe she could
do it again.

31:07.533 --> 31:10.569
What did they do to you?

31:13.239 --> 31:17.109
REED: All that time,
all those years.

31:17.143 --> 31:18.444
How could you not tell me?

31:18.477 --> 31:23.215
I was trying to
give you a normal life.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.952
You had no right to keep it...

31:25.985 --> 31:29.721
To protect you?
You're my son, I had no choice.

31:29.755 --> 31:33.792
These people are family.
They were monsters, Reed.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.127
But just because
we shared the same genes

31:35.161 --> 31:36.395
doesn't mean we were gonna...

31:36.428 --> 31:38.764
I couldn't take that chance.
I couldn't.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.906
How much did my mother know?

31:50.576 --> 31:55.747
All she really knew was
that I had secrets.

31:57.649 --> 32:00.919
That was what destroyed
what I had with her.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.621
And with me.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.025
Yes.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.461
*

32:11.363 --> 32:15.234
We need to talk
about the children.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.503
What about them?

32:17.536 --> 32:19.805
Have they used
their abilities together?

32:19.838 --> 32:22.174
A little.

32:22.208 --> 32:25.311
Since they found their powers...

32:25.344 --> 32:28.114
have they held hands?

32:28.147 --> 32:29.515
I...

32:29.548 --> 32:30.983
THUNDERBIRD:
Reed!

32:31.017 --> 32:33.052
There's cars outside.
I think it's Sentinel Services.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.457
Sir, with all due respect,

32:38.490 --> 32:40.926
we had Otto Strucker
under surveillance for weeks.

32:40.959 --> 32:44.163
-We didn't get anything.
-Yes, I've read the reports.

32:44.196 --> 32:46.865
At this point, we have to assume
the mutants are aware of Trask.

32:46.898 --> 32:49.535
And if that's the case, they
have every reason to be here.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.537
Well, we're putting
a lot of pressure on them.

32:51.570 --> 32:52.638
I doubt they'd make
a move like this.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.040
What you don't understand is

32:54.073 --> 32:56.042
a move like this
is all they've got.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.077
Indulge me.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.652
Lock down the area.

33:07.753 --> 33:09.321
Watch this.

33:11.923 --> 33:13.259
(neck popping)

33:22.401 --> 33:24.170
THUNDERBIRD:
The mutant down there,

33:24.203 --> 33:25.871
that's my friend,
the one they turned.

33:25.904 --> 33:27.506
-He can suppress powers.
-Is there another way

33:27.539 --> 33:28.974
-out of here?
-(knocking)

33:29.007 --> 33:30.142
-Only the stairs.
-No, we can't fight

33:30.176 --> 33:32.010
our way out,
not with Pulse down there.

33:32.044 --> 33:34.046
They can cut me down
same as you.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.247
I'll go down.

33:35.281 --> 33:37.883
-You can't.
-I have to.

33:37.916 --> 33:38.984
Maybe I can do something.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.352
I told you,

33:40.386 --> 33:42.421
our family is different.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.393
I'm sorry, Reed.

33:47.426 --> 33:49.595
For everything.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.563
Tell your mother, will you?

33:51.597 --> 33:53.265
Take care of Lauren and Andy.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.401
Protect them, son.

33:55.434 --> 33:57.803
Protect the world from them.

33:59.438 --> 34:01.740
*

34:13.585 --> 34:16.255
(music box playing
simple melody)

34:18.056 --> 34:18.957
Can I help you?

34:18.990 --> 34:20.726
I certainly hope so.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.129
Otto Strucker, yes?

34:23.162 --> 34:25.431
And you are?

34:27.166 --> 34:29.568
It is an honor, sir.

34:29.601 --> 34:32.070
Dr. Roderick Campbell.
I'm a big admirer of your work.

34:32.104 --> 34:33.539
My work?

34:33.572 --> 34:35.774
I'm an antiques dealer.

34:35.807 --> 34:37.609
Before this, of course.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.445
I'm a fellow Trask man.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.547
I dug up your old research

34:41.580 --> 34:43.415
when the company
was reestablished.

34:43.449 --> 34:46.618
Your work on suppressing
the X-Gene was quite brilliant.

34:46.652 --> 34:48.220
It led directly to mine...

34:48.254 --> 34:50.389
enhancing it.

34:50.422 --> 34:53.292
As much as I would love
to talk shop, however, I'm here

34:53.325 --> 34:54.726
on a different matter.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.429
-I'm looking for your son.
-My son?

34:57.463 --> 35:01.099
We haven't spoken
to each other for years.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.834
CAMPBELL:
Is that so?

35:02.868 --> 35:04.803
(whispering):
We have to go down there.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.605
We can't. It's suicide.

35:06.638 --> 35:09.241
Reed, we have people
depending on us.

35:09.275 --> 35:12.511
The station. Your kids.

35:12.544 --> 35:15.681
I think you and your friend
should leave.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.783
Oh, I'm afraid I can't do that.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.618
I know you told the
investigators who came before

35:19.651 --> 35:21.953
that you were out of touch
with your family.

35:21.987 --> 35:23.989
As a man of science,
I'm sure you'll understand

35:24.022 --> 35:25.391
my need for verification.

35:27.159 --> 35:30.329
We're gonna search the place.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.498
-Send a team upstairs.
-OTTO: No, you won't.

35:32.531 --> 35:35.667
-AGENT: Sir, sir, look!
-I told you to lock this down!

35:37.836 --> 35:38.870
What's happening?

35:38.904 --> 35:40.539
I don't know. I...
(gasps)

35:41.873 --> 35:43.909
CAMPBELL:
Shut him down!

35:46.077 --> 35:47.846
Shoot him!

35:49.881 --> 35:51.082
-No.
-No. No!

35:53.919 --> 35:55.854
CAMPBELL:
Get out!

35:55.887 --> 35:57.523
(explosion)

35:57.556 --> 36:00.359
(high-pitched ringing)

36:00.392 --> 36:02.728
(distorted, echoing panting)

36:07.032 --> 36:09.100
(distorted, echoing gasps)

36:14.039 --> 36:16.442
(excited chatter in distance)

36:19.611 --> 36:21.046
AGENT:
Don't worry, Dr. Campbell.

36:21.079 --> 36:22.080
We're gonna get you
to a hospital.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.184
(tires squealing)

36:26.218 --> 36:27.118
Come on!

36:36.628 --> 36:38.196
*

36:54.446 --> 36:56.382
*

36:58.884 --> 37:00.286
Gus?

37:17.303 --> 37:19.271
Sorry.

37:19.305 --> 37:22.274
I am, too, brother.

37:22.308 --> 37:25.243
I'm gonna make them pay
for what they did to you.

37:29.615 --> 37:31.983
(faint grunting)

37:32.017 --> 37:34.019
(grunting stops)

37:44.963 --> 37:46.732
REED:
We should go.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.100
(sirens wailing in distance)

37:55.607 --> 37:57.643
I'm sorry to spring this on you.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.277
I-I don't know what else to do.

37:59.311 --> 38:00.912
I don't think she has long.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.581
It's okay.
I just hope I can help.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.316
-So, you think you can do this?
-Maybe.

38:04.350 --> 38:05.917
You understand what
we're fighting for, right?

38:05.951 --> 38:07.986
Sentinel Services
have my family.

38:08.019 --> 38:10.088
I'm here to fight.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.290
CAITLIN:
Don't worry.

38:12.324 --> 38:13.559
She's gonna help you.

38:19.665 --> 38:22.868
What are you getting?

38:22.901 --> 38:24.370
Need.

38:24.403 --> 38:26.605
And pain.

38:26.638 --> 38:27.973
ESME:
Oh, God,

38:28.006 --> 38:30.709
it's... awful.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.544
You don't have to talk.
Just think.

38:32.578 --> 38:34.580
(faint shuddering)

38:37.583 --> 38:39.451
MAN: Get on the ground!
Chloe, run!

38:39.485 --> 38:41.720
-CHLOE: Don't take my baby! Aah!
-(distorted gunshots)

38:41.753 --> 38:44.390
-Okay, what's happening?
-Are you getting something?

38:44.423 --> 38:46.858
ESME: She wants you to know
they killed her husband

38:46.892 --> 38:48.560
and took her daughter.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.962
Who-who did this to you?
Where are they?

38:50.996 --> 38:53.331
She gave me a vision of it.
I can see it.

38:53.365 --> 38:54.332
CAMPBELL (distorted):
...like weapons.

38:54.366 --> 38:56.334
...win this war.

38:56.368 --> 38:57.335
ESME:
It's a building.

38:57.369 --> 38:59.204
Some kind of lab.

38:59.237 --> 39:01.006
North of here.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.340
Well, can you find it?

39:02.374 --> 39:03.509
I-I think so.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.877
(shuddering breaths)

39:05.911 --> 39:08.580
CAITLIN:
Listen to me, Chloe.

39:08.614 --> 39:11.216
We will find the people
who did this to you

39:11.249 --> 39:12.718
and make sure it never...

39:12.751 --> 39:14.653
(dying exhale)

39:14.686 --> 39:17.856
*

39:31.970 --> 39:35.741
Those don't look so good.

39:35.774 --> 39:39.110
Look, I'm sorry about
what I said earlier, okay?

39:39.144 --> 39:41.547
I need a favor.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.515
You're the only one
that can help.

39:43.549 --> 39:46.518
-What is it?
-There's a new kid that came in.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.186
A refugee.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.922
She had the same
foster parents as me.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.958
When I got sick

39:52.991 --> 39:54.626
and my portals went crazy,

39:54.660 --> 39:57.228
I kept trying to portal
back there, and...

39:57.262 --> 39:58.764
that's how they found them.

40:01.166 --> 40:03.401
She watched them die,

40:03.435 --> 40:06.638
and now she can't stop
dreaming about it.

40:06.672 --> 40:08.206
It's all my fault.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.375
I can't take those memories
away from her.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.478
But you can.

40:16.682 --> 40:18.484
Okay.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.852
* Oh...

40:24.155 --> 40:25.724
* Adeline

40:25.757 --> 40:26.958
* Oh, Adeline

40:26.992 --> 40:28.994
(soft, distorted whooshing)

40:29.027 --> 40:32.464
* Oh, Adeline, oh, Adeline

40:32.498 --> 40:34.566
* Oh, Adeline

40:34.600 --> 40:36.935
* Oh...

40:39.605 --> 40:42.974
* Kodachrome blue sky

40:47.613 --> 40:49.915
* Strokes

40:49.948 --> 40:53.752
* From patch to warm patch

40:53.785 --> 40:55.654
* My sweet Adeline

40:59.858 --> 41:03.394
* Ooh, ooh, ooh...

41:07.232 --> 41:09.100
* I wish you well

41:09.134 --> 41:11.136
* Ah, ah, ah, ah

41:11.169 --> 41:13.872
* Oh, Adeline

41:13.905 --> 41:16.041
* I wish you well

41:20.746 --> 41:22.981
* I wish you well

41:23.014 --> 41:24.616
* Ah, ah, ah, ah

41:24.650 --> 41:27.218
* Oh, Adeline

41:27.252 --> 41:29.821
* I wish you well

41:34.760 --> 41:37.863
* And the old triangle

41:37.896 --> 41:41.633
* Went jingle-jangle

41:41.667 --> 41:45.937
* All along the Royal Canal

41:48.439 --> 41:51.677
* My Adeline was swimming

41:51.710 --> 41:55.180
* Sweet Adeline was singing

41:55.213 --> 41:56.982
* To the tune

41:57.015 --> 41:59.551
* Of the Royal Canal

42:01.553 --> 42:04.489
* She's a swim... *

42:04.522 --> 42:06.024
-(knocking)
-Dad!

42:07.693 --> 42:09.027
LAUREN:
What took you so long?

42:09.060 --> 42:10.528
* Swimmer...

42:10.562 --> 42:12.831
Are you all right?

42:12.864 --> 42:15.567
-(takes deep breath) Um...
-ANDY: What is it?

42:15.601 --> 42:17.235
* Swim...

42:18.937 --> 42:20.271
What happened with your dad?

42:20.305 --> 42:23.341
I, um...

42:23.374 --> 42:25.210
* Swimmer

42:25.243 --> 42:26.778
* Swimmer...

42:28.880 --> 42:30.782

on The Gifted.

43:33.378 --> 43:35.814
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.617
People have been fighting
for a long time.

43:40.652 --> 43:42.220
And now it's our turn.
