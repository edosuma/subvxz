WEBVTT

00:06.740 --> 00:09.543
( music plays in elevator )

00:09.577 --> 00:12.480
DOOLEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY ELEVATOR?!

00:12.513 --> 00:15.716
I'M ENJOYING THE MUSIC.
TODAY IS "LOVE SONGS
FROM THE NINETIES."

00:15.749 --> 00:18.986
USE THE STAIRS!

00:19.019 --> 00:22.556
THIS IS EXACTLY HOW
HEALTHY KIDS BECOME
UNHEALTHY ADULTS.

00:22.590 --> 00:26.627
REALLY? ARE WE
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION?

00:26.660 --> 00:30.030
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
I'M A SPEED WALKER.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.600
PERHAPS YOU'VE SEEN ME
AT THE MISSION CREEK MALL

00:32.633 --> 00:35.703
GIVING THE SHOPPERS
A LITTLE EYE CANDY?

00:37.638 --> 00:39.607
LISTEN UP, SPACE-FILLERS!

00:39.640 --> 00:42.042
THIS IS EMERGENCY
PREPAREDNESS WEEK.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.545
AN EMERGENCY DRILL
CAN HAPPEN AT ANY TIME.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.514
SO WHEN THE ALARM SOUNDS,

00:46.547 --> 00:50.251
YOU MUST EVACUATE THE BUILDING
IN AN ORDERLY FASHION--

00:50.284 --> 00:54.655
LIKE CATTLE,
IF CATTLE HAD ACNE...
AND BRACES...

00:54.688 --> 00:59.660
AND A FUTURE FILLING UP
MY GAS TANK. (laughs)

00:59.693 --> 01:02.696
OH, MAN! I WISH I HAD
BREE'S SUPER-SPEED!

01:02.730 --> 01:06.667
BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT
TO BE STUCK WALKING BEHIND
COWS IN AN EMERGENCY,

01:06.700 --> 01:08.669
TRUST ME ON THAT.

01:08.702 --> 01:11.105
YOU WOULD TRADE
YOUR SUPER-STRENGTH

01:11.139 --> 01:12.806
FOR BREE'S SUPER-SPEED?

01:12.840 --> 01:14.542
MAN, IF I HAD YOUR STRENGTH,

01:14.575 --> 01:18.312
I'D JUST RUN OUT OF THE BUILDING
JUGGLING THOSE COWS.

01:18.346 --> 01:20.381
YEAH, AND IF I HAD
YOUR SUPER-INTELLIGENCE,

01:20.414 --> 01:24.718
I'D HAVE WALKED AWAY
FROM THIS CONVERSATION
THIRTY SECONDS AGO.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.487
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD BE AWESOME?

01:26.520 --> 01:29.557
IF YOU GUYS TOOK OUT
YOUR BIONIC CHIPS
AND SWITCHED YOUR ABILITIES.

01:30.824 --> 01:33.461
I CALL YOUR SUPER-SMARTS!

01:33.494 --> 01:35.729
I CALL YOUR SUPER-STRENGTH!

01:35.763 --> 01:38.732
I CALL GOOD LOOKS AND CHARISMA.
OH, TOO LATE. ALREADY GOT 'EM.

01:41.302 --> 01:44.272
Narrator:
 THE WORLD'S FIRST
 BIONIC SUPERHUMANS--

01:44.305 --> 01:48.576
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,
 FASTER, SMARTER.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.078
THE NEXT GENERATION
 OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

01:51.111 --> 01:53.314
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?!

01:53.347 --> 01:56.650
**

02:01.789 --> 02:03.624
( all screaming )

02:32.286 --> 02:35.223
IF YOU GUYS ARE GONNA SWITCH
YOUR CHIPS BEFORE BEFORE SCHOOL,

02:35.256 --> 02:37.758
DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD
RUN THIS BY DAVENPORT FIRST?

02:37.791 --> 02:39.693
THEWELL, YEAH,IPS.

02:39.727 --> 02:42.463
BUT WHAT IF
SOMETHING GLITCHES OUT
AND YOU END UP WITH

02:42.496 --> 02:46.567
ADAM'S GIGANTIC HEAD
ON CHASE'S TINY,
DOLL-LIKE BODY?

02:46.600 --> 02:50.271
WE DON'T HAVE TO
ASK "DADDY" FOR PERMISSION
ON EVERY SINGLE THING WE DO.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.540
YEAH. I MEAN, DO YOU THINK
I ASK DAVENPORT

02:52.573 --> 02:54.642
WHICH SHOE GOES ON WHICH FOOT?

02:54.675 --> 02:59.146
NO! I LABEL THEM
"LEFT" AND "NOT LEFT."

02:59.179 --> 03:03.217
OKAY, BREE. ATTACH
THE CHIP EXTRACTORS
TO THE CAPSULES.

03:03.251 --> 03:05.653
I'LL PROGRAM THE COMPUTER
FOR CHIP REMOVAL.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.388
AND ADAM, YOU...

03:07.421 --> 03:09.657
JUS-JUST GET IN YOUR CAPSULE.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.359
WHOO!

03:11.392 --> 03:15.863
NOW, LEO, I HAVE
 THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB
 OF ALL FOR YOU.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.732
NOW, ONCE WE GET INSIDE,

03:18.766 --> 03:21.201
I'M GOING TO NEED YOU...

03:21.235 --> 03:24.505
TO PUSH THIS
GREEN BUTTON.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.507
YEAH. AND THEN
I'LL PUSH THE BUTTON

03:26.540 --> 03:29.977
THAT MAKES YOU STOP
TALKING TO ME LIKE I'M FIVE.

03:34.648 --> 03:35.849
( beep )

03:35.883 --> 03:38.852
( whooshing, beeping )

03:43.457 --> 03:45.659
OH, NO!
MY HEAD'S COMING OFF!

03:46.894 --> 03:48.228
KIDDING.

03:50.598 --> 03:53.701
( whooshing,
powering down )

03:57.271 --> 03:58.506
DO YOU THINK IT WORKED?

03:58.539 --> 04:01.675
I DON'T KNOW.
HEY, ADAM, LET'S ARM WRESTLE.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.546
AHH!

04:05.579 --> 04:07.281
YES!

04:07.315 --> 04:10.017
WHO'S GOT THE TINY,
DOLL-LIKE BODY NOW?

04:11.685 --> 04:13.454
IOH, LEO.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.689
THIS IS GONNA BE
A PIECE OF CAKE--

04:15.723 --> 04:17.591
AAAH!

04:17.625 --> 04:20.861
HEY, HURRY UP, YOU GUYS.
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.796
OH. HEY, BIG D. UM...

04:22.830 --> 04:25.533
JUST A SIMPLE QUESTION.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.301
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

04:27.335 --> 04:30.538
IF THREE TOTALLY
RANDOM BIONIC KIDS

04:30.571 --> 04:33.774
DECIDED TO
SWITCH THEIR CHIPS?

04:33.807 --> 04:37.378
I'M NOT ASKING FOR THEM,
IT'S FOR THREE OF
MY OTHE BIONIC FRIENDS.

04:37.411 --> 04:41.915
WAIT-- YOU HAVE
THREE OTHER BIONIC FRIENDS?
HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL US?

04:41.949 --> 04:44.318
WE COULD GET, LIKE,
A MINI-VAN AND CAR POOL.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.987
YOU GUYS DIDN'T
SWITCH YOUR CHIPS,
DID YOU?

04:47.020 --> 04:49.957
NO.

04:49.990 --> 04:53.761
OH, GOOD, 'CAUSE THAT
WOULD BE A CRAZY IDEA.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.564
SEE, I CALIBRATED THEIR BIONICS
TO MATCH THEIR BIOLOGY.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.299
ADAM HAS HEIGHT,
SO I PAIRED THAT WITH STRENGTH,

04:59.333 --> 05:01.635
AND BREE IS LEAN,
SO THAT INCREASES HER SPEED,

05:01.669 --> 05:05.673
AND CHASE, OF COURSE,
NOBODY QUESTIONS CHASE'S
IMPOSSIBLE WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE

05:05.706 --> 05:07.608
BECAUSE HE'S, YOU KNOW, NERDY.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.943
YEP.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.846
I GOT ALL SORTS OF SMARTS
UP IN HERE.

05:12.880 --> 05:16.517
HEH. LIKE NUMBERS
AND MATHY STUFF.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.787
THE POINT IS,

05:19.820 --> 05:21.622
SWITCHING THEIR CHIPS
COULD CAUSE

05:21.655 --> 05:24.425
ALL KINDS OF
UNPREDICTABLE PROBLEMS,

05:24.458 --> 05:28.061
SO YOU SHOULD NEVER DO IT...
 EVER.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.999
I HAVE SPOKEN!

05:34.835 --> 05:39.039
(scoffs) MR. DAVENPORT
IS MAKING SUCH A BIG DEAL
ABOUT NOTHING.

05:39.072 --> 05:42.342
I KNOW. I MEAN,
WE ALREADY SWITCHED OUR CHIPS
AND NOTHING BAD HAPPENED.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.512
WE'RE FINE.
RACE YOU TO SCHOOL!

05:45.546 --> 05:47.080
( cOHH! )

05:47.114 --> 05:48.749
( laughing )

05:48.782 --> 05:50.751
OH...

05:54.388 --> 05:56.089
OH, I ALMOST
FORGOT TO MENTION--

05:56.123 --> 05:58.325
BEFORE YOU TRY
LIFTING SOMETHING HEAVY,

05:58.358 --> 05:59.660
ALWAYS STRETCH FIRST.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.061
OKAY.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.096
( Chase grunts )

06:07.801 --> 06:11.071
OKAY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD STRETCH
BEFORE YOU STRETCH.

06:12.773 --> 06:13.774
( loud clank )

06:13.807 --> 06:15.375
EW! WHAT IS THAT?

06:15.409 --> 06:18.412
OH, MAN, I GOT SOME
GUACAMOLE ON MY SHIRT.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.417
ADAM, YOU FORGOT
TO CHANGE YOUR SHIRT.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.953
(laughs) I DIDN'T
GO HOME TO CHANGE,

06:25.986 --> 06:28.856
I JUST NEEDED SOME CHIPS
FOR MY GUAC.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.361
MORNING, FRANK.

06:34.394 --> 06:38.466
YOU KNOW, I DON'T TAKE THE TIME
TO GET TO KNOW MY STUDENTS.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.400
WHO IS FRANK?

06:40.434 --> 06:42.069
WHAT MAKES FRANK TICK?

06:42.102 --> 06:45.038
WHAT ARE FRANK'S DREAMS?

06:45.072 --> 06:46.740
FIRE DRILL!
( aGET UP, FRANK!s )

06:46.774 --> 06:48.809
GO! YOUR DREAMS JUST
BECAME A NIGHTMARE!

06:48.842 --> 06:51.779
( alarm bell continues )

06:51.812 --> 06:53.447
OH, MY EARS!

06:53.481 --> 06:56.717
OWWW!!!

06:56.750 --> 06:59.019
SHE'S NOT USED TO
MY BIONIC HEARING.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.989
I'VE CONDITIONED MYSELF
TO THE BELL. SHE HASN'T.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.390
( laughs )

07:03.423 --> 07:06.026
REMEMBER WHEN I
WAS THAT STUPID?

07:06.059 --> 07:07.427
( laughs )

07:07.461 --> 07:10.130
REMEMBER WHEN I WAS STUPID?

07:10.163 --> 07:11.665
OWWW!!!

07:11.699 --> 07:14.001
COME ON, SLOWPOKES,
PRETEND IT'S THE MALL!

07:14.034 --> 07:16.670
SWING THOSE ARMS!
SHOW THOSE SHOPPERS!

07:16.704 --> 07:18.872
THERE'S A FOOD COURT
AT THE FINISH LINE!

07:20.173 --> 07:21.441
OHH! PERRY!

07:24.177 --> 07:25.779
NOT SO FAST.

07:25.813 --> 07:28.015
DOOLEY, WHAT ARE
YOU THINKING?

07:28.048 --> 07:30.784
IN AN EMERGENCY THIS ELEVATOR
IS THE WORST PLACE YOU COULD BE!

07:30.818 --> 07:33.521
WELL, IT IS
NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.791
Leo:
WE'RE GOING UP.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.660
DID YOU PUSH A BUTTON?

07:39.693 --> 07:43.130
NO! YOU MUST HAVE BUMPED IT
WHEN YOU SHIFTED YOUR
CENTER OF GRAVY. GRAVITY.

07:44.598 --> 07:48.035
REMAIN CALM.
I'LL SUPER-SPEED US
OUT OF HERE.

07:48.068 --> 07:51.839
PLEASE KEEP YOUR HANDS AND LEGS
INSIDE AT ALL TIMES.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.473
WHOA. NOPE, CHASE.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.876
YOU HAVE TO BE
AT LEAST THIS TALL
TO RIDE THE RIDE.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.511
( both laughing )

07:57.545 --> 08:00.548
YOU GET IT? 'CAUSE YOU'RE
EMBARRASSINGLY SMALL.

08:00.581 --> 08:04.151
OH! WAIT. SPEAKING OF
EMBARRASSINGLY SMALL,
WHERE'S LEO?

08:04.184 --> 08:08.589
BREE, TRY TO USE
MY SUPER-HEARING
TO DETECT HIS VOICE.

08:08.622 --> 08:11.158
ALL I CAN HEAR IS
THAT STUPID ALARM!

08:11.191 --> 08:14.595
ADAM, USE YOUR HEAT VISION
TO TAKE OUT THAT ALARM.

08:14.628 --> 08:18.031
OR YOU USE MY HEAT VISION
TO TAKE OUT THE ALARM.

08:18.065 --> 08:21.034
SOMEBODY JUST DO
SOMETHING AND SOMETHING!

08:21.068 --> 08:23.837
( alarm bell continues )

08:23.871 --> 08:26.940
( zapping,
( electrical crackling )

08:26.974 --> 08:28.141
( lAAAAAH!nk )

08:29.509 --> 08:31.111
( crackling )

08:31.144 --> 08:33.145
NICE GOIN'.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.149
WELL, YOU TRY AIMING
A THOUSAND-DEGREE LASER
WITH YOUR EYEBALL.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.785
OH, I WILL, IF I CAN USE
YOUR EARS TO AIM IT.

08:38.818 --> 08:41.254
GET OFF ME!

08:44.191 --> 08:47.695
HUH! POWER'S STILL ON.
MUST BE A FUSE.

08:47.728 --> 08:51.298
THE ONE DAY I DON'T
WEAR MY TOOL BELT.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.602
HEY, I HAVE A PAPER CLIP.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.970
WELL, THAT WILL CERTAINLY
COME IN HANDY

08:57.004 --> 08:59.206
IF WE NEED TO HOLD
TWO PAPERS TOGETHER!

09:01.074 --> 09:03.977
( grunting loudly )

09:04.011 --> 09:06.013
OHH!

09:06.046 --> 09:08.281
GREAT. WE'RE STUCK
BETWEEN FLOORS.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.551
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

09:11.585 --> 09:14.788
IN HIGH SCHOOL I WAS
AN ALL-STATE SQUATTER.

09:14.822 --> 09:18.859
HEY, LISTEN UP,
GENERATION EPIC FAIL.

09:18.892 --> 09:23.230
IT'S YOUR FEARLESS
YET LOVEABLE LEADER
PRINCIPAL PERRY.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.298
I AM STUCK IN THE ELEVATOR.

09:25.332 --> 09:28.535
REPEAT: I AM STUCK
IN THE ELEVATOR. AGAIN:

09:28.568 --> 09:31.805
I AM STUCK IN THE ELEVATOR!!!

09:31.839 --> 09:34.241
SERVES HER RIGHT
FOR NOT TAKING THE STAIRS.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.244
HEY, I'M IN HERE TOO!

09:37.277 --> 09:39.747
REPEAT: I AM IN HERE TOO!
AGAIN:

09:39.780 --> 09:41.782
I AM IN HERE TOO!!!

09:41.815 --> 09:43.316
OH, NO.
THAT'S LEO!

09:43.350 --> 09:47.988
YOU JUST TRAPPED LEO
IN THE ELEVATOR WITH
PRINCIPAL PERRY.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.991
IF ANY SUPERHEROES
ARE LISTENING, I COULD
SURE USE SOME HELP!

09:52.359 --> 09:54.227
WHAT?! HE KNOWS SUPERHEROES?

09:54.261 --> 09:57.965
OH, IT'S PROBABLY THE OTHER
THREE BIONIC KIDS.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.867
WE ARE THE BIONIC KIDS.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.969
US. ME, YOU, AND HIM.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.336
US!

10:03.370 --> 10:05.605
LOOK OUT. I-I CAN FIX THIS.

10:07.074 --> 10:10.377
I JUST NEED SOMEONE
TO SHOW ME HOW.

10:12.312 --> 10:15.749
WITHOUT MY BIONICS,
THIS JUST LOOKS LIKE
A BUNCH OF PRETTY-COLORED WIRES!

10:15.783 --> 10:18.585
I WANT MY CHIP BACK.
 I WANT MY CHIP BACK!!!

10:18.618 --> 10:21.755
( zapping )

10:21.789 --> 10:24.658
( sizzling )

10:26.860 --> 10:27.995
OKAY.

10:28.028 --> 10:31.264
I HAVE TO STAY CALM
SO I DON'T GLITCH AGAIN,

10:31.298 --> 10:34.735
BUT JUST FOR THE RECORD
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY:

10:34.768 --> 10:37.337
NOT A FAN OF THE HEAT VISION.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.875
I SMELL SOMETHING BURNING.
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A FIRE?!

10:41.909 --> 10:43.376
WELL, IF THERE IS,

10:43.410 --> 10:45.278
THE FIRE IS EITHER
GONNA MELT THE CABLES

10:45.312 --> 10:47.014
AND WE'LL PLUMMET
THREE STORIES,

10:47.047 --> 10:50.283
OR THE FIRE WILL MELT US
 AND WE'LL PLUMMET
 THREE STORIES!

10:51.685 --> 10:54.087
IS IT TOO LATE
TO TAKE THE STAIRS?

10:56.056 --> 10:59.259
( crashAAAAAH!mbling )

11:05.232 --> 11:07.234
AHH, MR. DAVENPORT WAS RIGHT.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.169
WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE
SWITCHED OUR CHIPS.

11:09.202 --> 11:12.272
WITHOUT MY BIONIC INTELLIGENCE,
I'M JUST A DUMB BAG OF MEAT.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.743
NO OFFENSE, ADAM.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.244
AW, NONE TAKEN.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.213
MAN, WITHOUT MY SUPER-STRENGTH,
I JUST FEEL LIKE A PUNY,

11:20.247 --> 11:22.916
WEAK, DOLL-BODIED CHUMP
WITH AN UGLY SHIRT.

11:24.384 --> 11:27.020
NO OFFENSE, CHASE.

11:27.054 --> 11:32.225
LOOK, I'M CALCULATING
A RISK PROBABILITY ANALYSIS
OF THE SITUATION.

11:32.259 --> 11:36.163
YOU KNOW, MEASURING
THE STATISTICAL LIKELIHOOD OF
LEO'S SURVIVAL IN THE ELEVATOR

11:36.196 --> 11:38.932
VERSUS THE REAL CALCULATED RISKS
OF A PRECISION RESCUE ATTEMPT.

11:38.966 --> 11:42.702
SO BASED ON MY CALCULATIONS,
THE ANSWER TO SAVING LEO
IS OBVIOUS.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.238
YUP, WE CAN'T DO IT.
SORRY, BUDDY!

11:45.272 --> 11:48.075
OH! LET'NO! ADAM.A MOVIE!

11:48.108 --> 11:50.410
WE JUST HAVE TO RUSH HOME
AND SWITCH OUR CHIPS BACK.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.880
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

11:52.913 --> 11:54.948
LEO, WE HAVE TO
RUN HOME REAL QUICK.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.283
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.185
REALLY?
WHERE AM I GONNA GO?!

11:59.452 --> 12:01.154
DON'T COME OVER HERE.

12:06.293 --> 12:09.229
HEY! THERE'S A HATCH
ON THE ROOF. MAYBE
WE CAN CLIMB OUT.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.932
GREAT IDEA!
LOCK YOUR HANDS!

12:11.965 --> 12:14.935
I'LL USE 'EM
AS A STEPLADDER!

12:14.968 --> 12:18.738
YEAH, HOW ABOUT
YOU LOCK YOUR HANDS?

12:19.973 --> 12:21.274
OKAY?

12:21.308 --> 12:23.877
( grunting,
shrieking )

12:23.911 --> 12:25.445
OW!!! HEY--

12:25.478 --> 12:27.180
THAT'S NOT A HANDHOLD!

12:27.214 --> 12:28.982
CLIMB FASTER!

12:29.016 --> 12:32.519
I CAN'T! IT'S LIKE CLIMBING
A MARSHMALLOW MOUNTAIN!

12:39.326 --> 12:40.961
YOU'RE A NAIL-BITER?

12:40.994 --> 12:43.363
WELL, YEAH, SOMETIMES
WHEN I GET NERVOUS.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.132
ME TOO!

12:45.165 --> 12:46.333
IT HELPS ME FEEL--

12:46.366 --> 12:50.237
Both:
MORE IN CONTROL.

12:50.270 --> 12:54.274
THE THUMB'S MY FAVORITE.
IT'S THE FILET MIGNON
OF FINGERS.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.978
GOOD TO KNOW,
PRINCIPAL PERRY.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.914
CALL ME TERRY.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.116
CALL ME A CAB.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.521
( whooshing )

13:08.555 --> 13:10.357
( powering down )

13:12.325 --> 13:14.127
GREAT.
WE'RE BACK TO NORMAL.

13:14.161 --> 13:17.064
GRAB ON AND I'LL SUPER-SPEED US
BACK TO SCHOOL.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.365
HI!

13:19.466 --> 13:21.401
WHY AREN'T YOU GUYS
AT SCHOOL?

13:21.434 --> 13:26.039
AND WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT CLIMBING EACH OTHER?

13:27.340 --> 13:29.376
UH...(nervous laughter)...

13:29.409 --> 13:32.846
ADAM GOES ON THE BOTTOM
'CAUSE HE'S THE STURDIEST?

13:33.881 --> 13:36.884
UH, WE FORGOT OUR HOMEWORK.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.053
THERE IT IS.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.221
HEH HEH HEH.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.956
Chase: YEAH...

13:42.990 --> 13:46.426
NOW WE CAN...
 HAND IN OUR HOMEWORK

13:46.459 --> 13:49.362
FOR OUR ROBOTICS
ASSIGNMENT.

13:51.865 --> 13:55.268
YOU HAVE A ROBOTICS CLASS
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

13:55.302 --> 13:57.237
AND YOUR HOMEWORK

13:57.270 --> 14:00.874
IS A HAND THAT I DESIGNED.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.179
JUST TAKE US
BACK TO SCHOOL.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.881
UH-HUH.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.454
( loud creaking )

14:14.487 --> 14:18.425
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
IF IT COMES DOWN TO YOU OR ME,

14:18.458 --> 14:21.561
I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS FOR YA.

14:21.594 --> 14:25.098
WELL, DON'T WORRY. I KNOW
ADAM, BREE AND CHASE'LL
GET US OUT OF HERE.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.433
THEY ALWAYS GOT MY BACK.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.536
MUST BE NICE TO HAVE FRIENDS
WHO CARE ABOUT YOU SO MUCH.

14:29.569 --> 14:32.605
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE
I GOT PICKED ON ALL THE TIME.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.442
"ISN'T TERRY A BOY'S NAME?
(nasty laughter)"

14:35.475 --> 14:37.945
"NO!!!"

14:37.978 --> 14:40.981
I'M JUST GLAD THEY NEVER FOUND
OUT MY MIDDLE NAME IS "CHERRY."

14:41.014 --> 14:44.417
(stifled laughter)
WAIT. SO YOUR FULL NAME...

14:44.451 --> 14:47.054
IS TERRY CHERRY PERRY?

14:47.087 --> 14:48.421
I KNOW, RIGHT?

14:48.455 --> 14:51.959
WHEN I SAY IT PEOPLE THINK
I'M ORDERING ICE CREAM.

14:51.992 --> 14:55.128
WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,
AT MY LAST SCHOOL,

14:55.162 --> 14:59.199
THE MEAN KIDS DIDN'T
CALL ME LEO DOOLEY,
THEY CALLED ME LEO "DOODY."

14:59.232 --> 15:01.401
( snorting laughter )

15:01.434 --> 15:04.004
HEY, HEY,
EASE UP THERE, CHERRY.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.339
SORRY.

15:06.373 --> 15:10.910
I BECAME A PRINCIPAL SO
I COULD MAKE SURE KIDS LIKE ME
NEVER GET PICKED ON.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.580
NOW HERE I AM USING MY POWER
TO PICK ON KIDS!

15:13.613 --> 15:19.652
(crying) I'M NO BETTER
THAN THOSE BULLIES WERE!

15:19.686 --> 15:23.456
SORRY, DOOLEY.
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU
TO SEE ME LIKE THIS.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.626
CALL ME LEO.

15:26.659 --> 15:29.162
DON'T BE FRESH.

15:29.196 --> 15:31.164
( sobbing )

15:31.198 --> 15:35.368
OKAY, YOU HAVE
YOUR SMART CHIP BACK,
PROFESSOR. DO YOUR THING.

15:35.402 --> 15:39.372
OKAY. IF I CROSS A RED WIRE
WITH A PINK WIRE,

15:39.406 --> 15:43.043
I'LL END UP WITH A RED WIRE
CROSSED WITH A PINK WIRE.

15:45.412 --> 15:49.449
WAIT A SECOND.
THIS IS STILL ALL JUST
A BUNCH OF PRETTY COLORS TO ME!

15:49.482 --> 15:51.218
WHERE ARE MY SUPER-SMARTS?

15:51.251 --> 15:53.453
SINCE TRACTION ELEVATORS
OPERATE ON A PULLEY SYSTEM,

15:53.486 --> 15:56.423
WE JUST HAVE TO CALCULATE
THE WEIGHT OF THE CARS
PLUS PASSENGERS,

15:56.456 --> 15:58.491
MULTIPLY THAT BY
THE HEIGHT WE NEED TO MOVE IT,

15:58.525 --> 16:00.093
AND THAT WILL DETERMINE
THE ENERGY NEEDED.

16:00.127 --> 16:04.064
ALSO, A GROUP OF
TWELVE OR MORE COWS
IS CALLED A "FLINK."

16:04.097 --> 16:07.200
OH! I THINK MY BRAIN
JUST THREW UP!

16:07.234 --> 16:10.970
WAIT A SECOND. IF HE HAS
YOUR SUPER-INTELLIGENCE,

16:11.004 --> 16:13.440
DOES THAT MEAN THAT
YOU HAVE MY SPEED?

16:17.244 --> 16:19.579
AAAH! I RUN LIKE
A NORMAL PERSON!

16:19.612 --> 16:21.648
( whimpering )

16:21.681 --> 16:23.516
WE MUST HAVE SWITCHED
THE CHIPS AGAIN!

16:23.550 --> 16:25.518
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!

16:25.552 --> 16:29.022
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!

16:29.056 --> 16:30.390
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.525
(gasps)
I KNOW WHAT TO DO!

16:32.559 --> 16:35.195
THE ELEVATOR'S STUCK BETWEEN
THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.164
THERE ARE TWO REMAINING
HOIST CABLES LEFT HOLDING IT UP.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.399
BREE, IF YOUR REACH
THROUGH THE VENT
AND GRAB ONE OF THEM,

16:39.432 --> 16:42.602
YOU CAN USE YOUR SUPER-STRENGTH
TO PULL THE CAR UP TO
THE SECOND FLOOR.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.671
GOT IT.

16:44.704 --> 16:48.475
MAN, IT IS SO PECULIAR
WATCHING BREE HAVE
SUPER-STRENGTH.

16:48.508 --> 16:53.113
NOT AS PECULIAR AS YOU
USING THE WORD "PECULIAR."

16:55.315 --> 16:57.517
( grunting )

16:57.550 --> 16:58.985
( loud creaking )

16:59.018 --> 17:00.520
GREAT! PULL IT ANOTHER FIVE FEET

17:00.553 --> 17:02.555
AND IT SHOULD RAISE THE ELEVATOR
TO THE SECOND FLOOR LANDING.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.491
COME ON, BREE,
USE YOUR STRENGTH!

17:04.523 --> 17:05.724
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.694
( loud snapping )

17:09.162 --> 17:10.663
I GOTCHA, BABY! I GOTCHA!

17:10.696 --> 17:12.665
I-I HAD IT.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.737
( loud crash )

17:17.770 --> 17:19.739
I DON'T KNOW
MY OWN SUPER-STRENGTH.

17:19.771 --> 17:22.142
GREAT IDEA, ADAM.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.743
NOW THERE'S...

17:24.777 --> 17:28.047
(gasps) ONE CABLE
HOLDING THE ELEVATOR!

17:28.080 --> 17:30.483
OOH! CHASE CAN
COUNT TO ONE!

17:30.517 --> 17:32.419
BRAVO!

17:32.452 --> 17:35.021
NOW I KNOW WHY YOU GUYS ARE
ALWAYS MAKING FUN OF ME SO MUCH.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.589
I'M STUPID!

17:46.666 --> 17:48.601
IT'S TIMES LIKE THESE
I THINK:

17:48.635 --> 17:50.703
WHO'S GONNA FEEL
ALL MY CATS?

17:50.737 --> 17:51.738
(gasps)

17:51.771 --> 17:54.207
I HOPE THEY
DON'T EAT MOTHER.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.642
(gasps louder)

17:55.675 --> 17:57.377
I HOPE SHE DOESN'T
EAT THEM!

18:01.414 --> 18:02.682
HEY, DOOLEY.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.485
I'M SORRY FOR BEING
SO HARD ON YOU.

18:05.518 --> 18:08.255
YOU'RE NOT
SUCH A BAD KID.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.656
THANKS.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.491
AND YOU...

18:11.524 --> 18:14.694
ARE A TOLERABLE MIDDLE-AGED
AUTHORITY FIGURE.

18:16.663 --> 18:19.299
THAT'S THE NICEST THING
ANYONE'S EVER SAID TO ME.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.733
THANKS, LEO.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.536
"DOODY."
HA HA HA HA!

18:23.570 --> 18:25.238
SORRY, I COULDN'T RESIST.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.207
HA HA HA HA HA!

18:27.240 --> 18:28.608
MMM!

18:30.577 --> 18:32.845
OKAY, THERE'S ONLY
ONE CABLE LEFT.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.348
DON'T PULL IT TOO OKAY.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.517
AND DON'T PULL IT
TOO OKAY.

18:37.550 --> 18:38.851
ACTUALLY,
YOU MIGHT WANT TO--

18:38.885 --> 18:40.687
YOU MAY WANT TO
STOP TALKING!

18:42.555 --> 18:44.591
WHAT IF THIS DOESN'T WORK?

18:44.624 --> 18:46.526
THE TRACTION CABLE WILL SEVER,

18:46.559 --> 18:48.495
CAUSING THE ELEVATOR CAR
TO VERTICALLY FREE-FALL

18:48.528 --> 18:49.862
UNTIL IT CRASHES
INTO THE BASEMENT,

18:49.896 --> 18:53.233
CRUSHING IT
AND ANYONE INSIDE.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.202
BUT YOU WILL
BE ABLE TO DO IT!

18:57.604 --> 18:59.639
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
CONTROL YOUR BIONICS.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.442
I'LL TEACH YOU. THE KEY TO
PULLING SOMETHING HEAVY

19:02.475 --> 19:04.677
IS REMEMBERING TO KEEP
A STRONG CENTER OF GRAVITY.

19:04.711 --> 19:08.415
THAT WAY, YOU'RE LIFTING
WITH YOUR ENTIRE BODY
INSTEAD OF ANY ONE PART.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.150
IT ALSO HELPS TO
KEEP A BLANK MIND.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.752
OH, MAN, I MISS THAT.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.390
OKAY...
STRONG CENTER OF GRAVITY...

19:17.424 --> 19:19.659
MIND IS BLANK.

19:19.692 --> 19:20.893
HERE I GO.

19:22.695 --> 19:27.667
( creaking,
metallic whining )

19:29.602 --> 19:31.638
YES! IT'S WORKING!

19:37.477 --> 19:39.312
( elevator bell dings )

19:44.651 --> 19:46.886
WE DIDYES!

19:46.919 --> 19:48.721
Both:
WE MADE IT!

19:48.755 --> 19:49.589
(laughing)

19:49.622 --> 19:50.757
UGHH.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.826
I THOUGHT WE BONDED.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.729
I WAS DESPERATE!
DON'T GET ALL WEIRD, DOODY!

19:58.531 --> 20:00.400
( elevator bell dings )

20:00.433 --> 20:03.536
UHHH! UHH!

20:05.204 --> 20:09.476
DOOLEY! WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT BEING IN AN ELEVATOR

20:09.509 --> 20:10.710
IN AN EMERGENCY?!

20:10.743 --> 20:13.913
THAT IF YOU GET STUCK
GOTTA GO. EAT YOUR MOM.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.685
OH, GUYS!

20:18.718 --> 20:21.721
THANK YOU FOR
SAVING MY LIFE!

20:21.754 --> 20:23.556
I OWE YOU GUYS.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.659
ACTUALLY, WE'RE THE ONES
THAT GOT YOU STUCK IN THERE.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.796
OH. WELL THEN, YOU'LL BE
HEARING FROM MY LAWYERS.

20:40.273 --> 20:43.543
HEY, GUYS,
HOW WAS SCHOOL?
HOW'D THE CHIP SWITCH GO?

20:43.576 --> 20:45.778
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

20:45.812 --> 20:50.717
FIRST OF ALL,
ADAM IS READING A BOOK
INSTEAD OF GNAWING ON IT...

20:50.750 --> 20:52.785
AND YOU LEFT THE EXTRACTORS OUT.

20:52.819 --> 20:56.623
LOOK, MR. DAVENPORT,
WE KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,

20:56.656 --> 20:58.591
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.894
WITHOUT OUR CHIPS, WE'RE,
LIKE, TOTALLY USELESS--

21:01.928 --> 21:03.896
LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.934
LOOK, I'M GLAD YOU GUYS
LEARNED YOUR LESSON,

21:07.967 --> 21:09.536
BUT I'M VERY
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

21:09.569 --> 21:13.473
NOW, HOW BIG OF A BILL
CAN I EXPECT FROM THE SCHOOL?

21:13.506 --> 21:16.576
NONE. WE MADE IT ALL
LOOK LIKE AN ACCIDENT.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.812
HA! YES! WAY TO GO!

21:19.846 --> 21:22.615
OW! SHE HAS THE STRENGTH
RIGHT NOW, RIGHT?

21:22.649 --> 21:23.716
YEAH.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.059
**
