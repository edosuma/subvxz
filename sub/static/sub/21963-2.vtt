00:01.335 --> 00:03.304
You're teaming up
with the guys from Ghosted.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.039
I could have died
in there!

00:05.073 --> 00:06.974
Aw, somebody
need a hug?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.642
Catch all-new episodes Sundays.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.244
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.278 --> 00:13.081
The Orville, Gotham,
and Lucifer.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.548
Remember me?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.686 --> 00:22.090
-Previously on Ghosted... -The
Bureau Underground was created

00:22.123 --> 00:25.259
to protect humanity
from paranormal forces.

00:25.293 --> 00:28.762
Leroy, you were the best missing
persons detective the LAPD

00:28.796 --> 00:32.266
ever had. Max, you were
a brilliant astrophysicist.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.434
LEROY:
What happened with your wife?

00:33.467 --> 00:34.502
She was abducted.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.003
Oh, my God.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.405
-That's my wife.
-(shrieks)

00:37.438 --> 00:39.840
Everything I was called crazy
for believing

00:39.873 --> 00:41.942
is real.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.244
I mean, we were right there.

00:43.277 --> 00:47.181
Gentlemen, welcome
to the Bureau Underground.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.582
("The Power of Love" by
Huey Lewis & the News playing)

00:48.616 --> 00:51.085
Look at us.
Look at... l-look at us.

00:51.119 --> 00:53.787
We're just driving to work.
Just a couple of guys.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.023
Two Bureau Underground agents.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.691
Can you believe this is our job?

00:57.725 --> 01:00.228
You mean, can I believe there's
an entire government agency

01:00.261 --> 01:02.696
dedicated to hunting down
make-believe stuff?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.465
No, I cannot.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.234
Well, you're working for 'em.
You better believe it.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.969
Man, starting a dream job.

01:09.002 --> 01:11.639
LaFrey says I get to see my wife
in a few days.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.242
This might be the most exciting
week of my life.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.577
Mine was first week of summer,
senior year.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.045
I saw Prince that week.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.547
Was it the Lovesexy Tour?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.282
Or, no, the-the Nude Tour?

01:21.315 --> 01:23.551
He was coming out of a JCPenney.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.753
Huh. That's cool.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.555
That's a pretty good
celebrity sighting.

01:27.588 --> 01:31.459
Mm, I think I have it beat,
but, you know, no biggie.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.726
Over Prince?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.128
* Stronger and harder...

01:34.162 --> 01:36.130
It was Blaine Torgen.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.331
I don't know who that is.

01:37.365 --> 01:38.899
Celebrity professor
Blaine Torgen.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.568
Author of The Spaghetti Theorem.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.570
-No one has heard of
Blaine Torgen. -Blaine Torgen.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.972
Spaghe... The Spaghetti
Theorem. Blaine Torgen.

01:45.005 --> 01:47.141
-Pro... Celebrity professor.
-Stop saying "Spaghetti Theorem,

01:47.175 --> 01:49.109
celebrity professor."
Nobody heard of him.

01:49.143 --> 01:50.978
Just 'cause you know
who he is...

01:51.011 --> 01:52.913
I went as him for Halloween
last year.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.448
What'd you wear, a turtleneck?

01:54.482 --> 01:56.150
Ah, see,
I knew you knew who he was.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.951
Hey, speaking of Halloween,
you excited?

01:57.985 --> 02:00.854
I'm taking my old LAPD partner's
kid trick-or-treating.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.090
-No way. -Yeah,
he's been reaching out lately.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.693
-So it was... it was exciting
to hear from him. -That's great.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.027
(clicks tongue)

02:07.060 --> 02:09.430
So...

02:09.463 --> 02:13.033
* First time you feel it,
it might make you sad... *

02:13.066 --> 02:14.702
What am I doing?
Oh, I'm probably...

02:14.735 --> 02:16.036
You know what, I'm
probably just gonna stay home.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.006
Would you like to hang with us?

02:19.039 --> 02:20.441
Very much. Thank you.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.042
Oh, my God,
what a nice invitation.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.211
This is gonna be so fun.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.778
Boom. Halloween.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.047
It's gonna be
the best one ever, I promise.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.082
*

02:31.685 --> 02:34.188
-(rock music playing)
-(metallic rattling, crashing)

02:35.756 --> 02:37.758
(snarling)

02:39.193 --> 02:42.162
MAN:
Damn animal in here again.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.130
* Warriors!

02:43.163 --> 02:44.565
(screeching)

02:44.598 --> 02:47.100
-(line ringing)
-(alert beeping)

02:49.002 --> 02:50.971
DISPATCHER: 911. What's
the nature of your emergency?

02:51.004 --> 02:53.507
(cat yowls, snarls)

02:53.541 --> 02:55.776
(screeching)

03:02.550 --> 03:05.018
(alert beeping)

03:05.052 --> 03:07.921
(gasps)
Ay, papi.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.423
Captain
LaFrey!

03:09.457 --> 03:11.659
Oh, that came out significantly
louder than I intended.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.160
Barry, it is Halloween,

03:13.193 --> 03:16.029
there is a full moon
and a meteor shower on the way.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.399
It's a paranormal perfect storm.
What do you want?

03:18.432 --> 03:22.102
When I look back up,
you better not be a cat.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.171
We've got to get a team on this.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.274
-Who's available? -Our
top agents are all deployed.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.709
Between a reported lycanthrope
sighting, multiple hauntings,

03:28.742 --> 03:31.111
and Sad Brian's destination
wedding in Sacramento,

03:31.144 --> 03:32.212
-we're really short-staffed.
-(sighs) Okay,

03:32.246 --> 03:33.581
well, just get whoever's left.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.083
Go. Now.

03:36.116 --> 03:39.119
Anyway, look, uh, thank you for
letting me tag along tonight,

03:39.152 --> 03:40.788
you know? It's...

03:40.821 --> 03:43.056
Who are you again?

03:43.090 --> 03:45.025
Max.

03:45.058 --> 03:49.129
I mean, I'm sure Leroy...
must've mentioned me.

03:49.162 --> 03:50.931
His cool new friend, Max?

03:50.964 --> 03:52.232
Max-a-million?

03:52.266 --> 03:53.734
The Max Man?

03:53.767 --> 03:55.202
No? Nothing? No nicknames?

03:55.235 --> 03:57.204
No? It's all right.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.473
I'm sure he mentioned me and
you just... couldn't hear him.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.409
Must have been loud there.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.610
Where?

04:02.643 --> 04:05.112
Nothing.

04:05.145 --> 04:07.481
Thanks again for this.
He's been asking all week,

04:07.515 --> 04:08.982
"Can I go trick-or-treating
with Leroy?

04:09.016 --> 04:10.484
I want to spend time
with Leroy."

04:10.518 --> 04:12.820
That's nice to hear. Those
last couple times I hit him up,

04:12.853 --> 04:14.722
he was like,
"Oh, I'm already booked."

04:14.755 --> 04:16.223
You know, with his dad gone,

04:16.256 --> 04:19.092
it means a lot to me,
you spending time with him.

04:19.126 --> 04:21.094
But, Leroy, I don't want him
coming home

04:21.128 --> 04:23.964
knowing any new swear words.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.766
I did not teach him
"tig ol' bitties."

04:25.799 --> 04:28.135
That was his friend...
in geometry class.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.838
-Uh-huh. -I swear to God.
I'll see you later.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.174
LEROY:
Halloween.

04:34.207 --> 04:37.678
All right, Jermaine, we're
gonna hit some condo complexes.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.113
The doors are close together,
like at apartment buildings,

04:40.147 --> 04:41.148
but they got
a little bit more money,

04:41.181 --> 04:42.683
so none of that fun size crap.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.184
Why do I smell cologne?

04:44.217 --> 04:47.821
Jermaine, I know you didn't
put on cologne for me.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.123
So, this girl at school
is having a party,

04:50.157 --> 04:52.159
-and she asked me to come.
-(chuckles)

04:52.192 --> 04:55.295
Whoa! Look at that,
Big J laying it down.

04:55.329 --> 04:57.531
My mom said I can't go,
but I figured

04:57.565 --> 04:59.967
you could just drop me off.
It's not far.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.670
Wait, so is that the reason
you asked me

05:02.703 --> 05:04.137
to take you trick-or-treating?

05:04.171 --> 05:06.340
Come on.
I can't miss this party.

05:06.374 --> 05:09.777
-I heard there's even gonna be
a backrub circle. -Oh.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.479
I mean, it sounds
like you got to go.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.180
Exactly. He gets it.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.348
I'm just calling it
like I see it.

05:14.382 --> 05:17.050
And this jam sounds can't-miss.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.353
Max, I will turn this car around
and take you right home.

05:19.387 --> 05:23.624
-Yep. Sorry. -Jermaine, if your
mom says you can't go, then...

05:23.657 --> 05:25.192
I can't believe this.

05:25.225 --> 05:26.627
You used to be cool.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.596
Now you're just a lame mall cop.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.366
(ringtone plays)

05:32.400 --> 05:33.967
-Hello?
-Leroy, it's Captain LaFrey.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.836
-I need you and Max to check
something out for me. -Oh,

05:35.869 --> 05:38.472
come on, Captain, I specifically
requested this night off.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.040
Tell you what,
you just do what you need to do,

05:40.073 --> 05:42.209
and I'll touch base
with the monstrous creature

05:42.242 --> 05:45.012
and let it know
that its timing is not ideal.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.580
Leroy, just find the damn thing.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.916
Barry's sending the info now.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.186
Agent Lu,

05:53.220 --> 05:55.255
-he's on you. Get out now.
-(shouting)

05:55.288 --> 05:56.890
-(phone chimes)
-Here, check this out.

05:56.924 --> 06:00.561
MAX: Um, okay, this could be
a... important situation.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.862
What are we gonna do
with our friend here?

06:01.895 --> 06:03.196
We'll check it out.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.898
If it's nothing, we'll move on.

06:04.932 --> 06:07.267
*

06:14.975 --> 06:17.210
Jermaine, stay in the car.
We'll be right back.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.747
-Come on, man. I'm gonna be late
to the party. -Ugh.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.049
Heard that. Two times.
Listen, give us, like, five,

06:22.082 --> 06:24.051
-then we'll roll
to your thing, bro. Huh?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.453
-(knocking)
-Let's go! -Yep.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.889
What the hell is your problem?

06:28.922 --> 06:30.458
Was that rhetorical

06:30.491 --> 06:32.893
or do you legitimately want
to discuss my flaws?

06:32.926 --> 06:35.563
'Cause I'm happy to have
that conversation.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.098
Dude, you know
what I'm talking about.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.133
Look, I am trying
to help you, okay?

06:40.167 --> 06:41.969
Because, right now,
Jermaine sees you

06:42.002 --> 06:44.638
as the lame guy
who's trying to ruin his life.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.273
And we need to rehab that image.

06:46.306 --> 06:47.975
I'm responsible for that kid.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.777
Can I just give you
a little advice on kids?

06:49.810 --> 06:51.445
-No, you cannot. -Look,
if you want to win a kid over,

06:51.479 --> 06:53.313
you treat him as your equal.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.549
I mean, that's what my mom did.
We're still best friends.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.085
She was the best man
at my wedding.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.252
What?

06:59.286 --> 07:01.154
(snarling)

07:01.188 --> 07:03.323
Hey.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.458
What are you doing?

07:04.492 --> 07:05.893
There's a cool cat under here.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.160
Can I rescue him?

07:07.194 --> 07:08.962
I told you to stay in the car.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.831
Why would you disobey me?

07:10.864 --> 07:13.200
Dude, why are you trying
to be my dad?

07:14.034 --> 07:16.136
Okay, bring the cat.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.304
Hurry up.

07:17.337 --> 07:18.972
(hisses)

07:19.006 --> 07:21.074
Wait, Leroy, what are you doing?

07:21.108 --> 07:23.076
Isn't this
what you told me to do?

07:23.110 --> 07:25.312
Well, yeah, but,
I mean, a feral cat?

07:25.345 --> 07:26.980
It's-it's a lot of work.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.983
I mean, we'd have to get it
into a socialization program...

07:30.017 --> 07:32.620
-(snarls)
-Ow! (groans)

07:33.621 --> 07:35.188
You okay?

07:35.222 --> 07:36.790
I'm fine.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.992
It was a stupid cat anyway.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.194
LEROY:
Nothing there, LaFrey.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.964
-No creature, no mummy,
no ghost, no Dracula. -(snarls)

07:43.997 --> 07:46.333
And I'd keep going, but that's
all the monsters I know.

07:46.366 --> 07:48.301
-(snarling)
-Nothing there.

07:48.335 --> 07:49.970
Waste of time, end of story.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.204
(tires screeching)

07:53.874 --> 07:56.176
(growling, hissing)

07:56.209 --> 07:57.678
Let me call you back.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.353
-He kicked the door off the car.
-Come on!

08:07.988 --> 08:10.858
How'd he get so strong?
Hormones kicking in?

08:10.891 --> 08:13.827
Puberty doesn't make you
kick the door off the car.

08:13.861 --> 08:16.196
It gives you pimples
and makes you get a boner

08:16.229 --> 08:18.065
in front of your aunt.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.233
It only happened once.
She didn't even notice.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.570
Quit talking about your
aunt boners.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.037
Wait.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.573
The cat bit him.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.040
That's right.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.076
The-the cat--
the cat is the creature.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.844
(pants)

08:30.878 --> 08:33.113
-He's too fast. Come on,
let's get the car. -Yeah.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.849
Jenkins, can you hear me?

08:35.883 --> 08:38.218
I need you to keep moving and
check the area for radiation.

08:38.251 --> 08:41.054
Agent Simons, chop off the head
and blow it up.

08:41.088 --> 08:43.256
Look at her go.
She's magnificent.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.225
Well, she doesn't do it alone.

08:46.627 --> 08:49.029
-Oh.
-(phone vibrates)

08:49.062 --> 08:50.263
Hola.

08:50.297 --> 08:53.166
Barry. The creature is a cat.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.902
It bit Jermaine
and he kicked a door

08:54.935 --> 08:56.536
off the car and ran off.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.105
I'm sorry. Who's Jermaine?

08:58.138 --> 09:00.540
Oh. That's so nice
Leroy does that.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.409
How is he still single?

09:02.442 --> 09:04.277
Well, I don't know, Barry.
I'll give it some thought

09:04.311 --> 09:06.113
and get back to you, okay?

09:06.146 --> 09:08.281
But listen. Annie needs
to track Jermaine's phone.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.450
And Barry, the infection
took hold within minutes,

09:10.483 --> 09:12.052
so we have to contain this.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.021
We need your help right now.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.789
I'll call you right back.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.390
Barrie, you and Annie load up
with suppressive,

09:17.424 --> 09:19.259
non-lethal weaponry,
head out and make a drop.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.795
Then double back,
find the cat, hit the lab,

09:21.829 --> 09:23.764
and use that big nerdy head of
yours to come up an antidote.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.198
On six.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.100
How the hell did you know that?

09:27.134 --> 09:29.569
Barry, I know everything.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.205
Pull yourself together,
O'Connor, it feeds on fear.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.541
We are witnessing a master
at work; it's incredible.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.576
Yes, yes, but I'm just wondering
if she knows

09:36.610 --> 09:38.712
about my daily
two-and-a-half-hour siesta.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.580
It's for digestive purposes.
Doctor's orders. Come on.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.115
(doorbell rings)

09:42.149 --> 09:44.652
(indistinct chatter)

09:44.685 --> 09:46.586
Jermaine, you made it.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.321
Come on in.

09:55.528 --> 09:58.098
Oh, my God, Jermaine,
you're hilarious.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.833
(hissing, growling)

10:02.803 --> 10:04.672
MAX:
Okay. We're on Palm Street.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.908
I think Jermaine was still
trying to get to his party.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.476
LEROY:
Pretty quiet for a party.

10:09.509 --> 10:13.146
Parties tend to be loud,
boisterous affairs.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.148
Uh, yeah, Leroy.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.117
I've been to a party or two
in my time.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.151
One or two?

10:18.185 --> 10:19.987
You know what?

10:20.020 --> 10:21.689
I used to show up so early,

10:21.722 --> 10:25.659
people would be like,
"What? This guy's crazy."

10:27.194 --> 10:29.062
Uh, Leroy?

10:30.363 --> 10:34.001
(spooky music playing)

10:34.034 --> 10:35.102
(door squeaks, closes)

10:35.135 --> 10:36.336
Jermaine!

10:36.369 --> 10:39.172
Jermaine, you in here?

10:41.341 --> 10:42.810
Hey.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.177
Are you okay?

10:44.211 --> 10:45.713
Wh-what's going on?
What happened to you?

10:45.746 --> 10:47.047
(cracking, snarling)

10:49.216 --> 10:50.818
Okay, that-that's abnormal.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.786
-(growls)
-(gasps)

10:52.820 --> 10:55.155
-(screams)
-(glass breaking) -Max?

10:55.188 --> 10:56.156
(snarls and growls)

10:56.189 --> 10:58.158
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.193
Stay back. Stay back!

11:00.227 --> 11:02.730
-Max!
-(grunts)

11:03.997 --> 11:05.398
-What do I do?
-Punch her! Hit her!

11:05.432 --> 11:08.135
-Knock her out!
-Wait. I can't hit a kid.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.870
-Quit being a baby, man.
-Okay, wait.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.972
I'm a baby because
I won't punch a child?

11:12.005 --> 11:14.241
-That logic does not check out.
-Find something to hit her with

11:14.274 --> 11:16.143
hard enough to knock her out,

11:16.176 --> 11:17.377
soft enough I don't feel bad
about it.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.914
-Do it!
-(yells)

11:23.250 --> 11:26.754
And stay down,
you little psycho!

11:26.787 --> 11:28.121
Damn.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.592
Can't believe you struck
a child.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.929
(low growls nearby)

11:38.065 --> 11:40.433
Leroy, do you hear that?

11:42.269 --> 11:44.104
(growling and snarling)

11:45.105 --> 11:46.807
(screams)

11:47.908 --> 11:49.877
Hey, guys. What's the situation?

11:49.910 --> 11:52.079
Okay. It is really bad in there.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.781
The infection has spread.
Luckily, it is contained

11:53.814 --> 11:55.849
in the house, but,
unfortunately, that house

11:55.883 --> 11:58.051
is filled with really angry
little zombie kids.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.352
Jermaine is in there.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.720
I need to get him out now.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.457
Stun guns, smoke grenades,

12:04.491 --> 12:06.359
tranq rifles
and full body armor.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.962
Now, the plan is to storm
the house, subdue the infected,

12:08.996 --> 12:12.265
pack 'em in the van, and
get 'em back to the Bureau.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.067
Now, don't make me regret
giving you this.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.069
Uh, look.
I am not a big drinker,

12:16.103 --> 12:18.138
but if I survive this,

12:18.171 --> 12:21.074
you owe me a really stiff
Midori Sour.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.243
I-I will owe you a drink,

12:23.276 --> 12:26.146
but I will be getting myself
a real one.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.580
What do you mean?

12:27.614 --> 12:29.149
Leroy,

12:29.182 --> 12:31.118
I want you to tell me something,
and be honest.

12:31.151 --> 12:35.455
This stuff is heavy, right?
It's not just me?

12:35.488 --> 12:38.225
Leroy? You okay?

12:38.258 --> 12:41.061
Bee-mo.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.096
That's what he used to call me.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.098
It meant Beast Mode,
but he was a little kid

12:45.132 --> 12:47.067
with a squeaky voice,
so it came out,

12:47.100 --> 12:49.369
(squeaky):
Bee-mo. Bee-mo.

12:51.538 --> 12:55.108
He used to think
I was the coolest.

12:55.142 --> 12:58.645
I guess I was just trying
to show I still was.

12:58.678 --> 13:01.581
But, if something happens
to him in there...

13:01.614 --> 13:03.483
Yeah, Leroy, I hear ya.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.485
But right now, Jermaine

13:05.518 --> 13:08.088
and every one else in that house
is counting on us.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.191
And by "us," I mean you,

13:11.224 --> 13:13.493
'cause I don't really know
how to do any of this stuff.

13:13.526 --> 13:16.196
Those kids need our help, Leroy.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.665
They need Bee-mo.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.670
Let's go get Jermaine.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.207
*

13:42.755 --> 13:44.157
(door closes)

13:44.191 --> 13:46.193
(panting)

13:53.033 --> 13:54.501
Sorry.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.173
Hey, Leroy.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.976
Did you bring spare batteries
for the flashlights?

14:03.010 --> 14:05.212
(gunshots, shrieking)

14:07.547 --> 14:09.049
That was so awesome.

14:11.384 --> 14:14.021
(growling)

14:14.054 --> 14:15.388
LEROY:
Max, shoot her!

14:17.224 --> 14:20.193
(growling, gunshot)

14:23.130 --> 14:24.331
That was exciting.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.432
-Stay focused.
-Okay.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.239
-I got one dart left.
-I think I've got four.

14:32.272 --> 14:35.042
I've been really smart about
my shot selection, so...

14:35.075 --> 14:37.644
Stay that way;
we might need it.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.514
What's that mean?

14:41.548 --> 14:42.715
What does...

14:42.749 --> 14:44.217
what does that mean?

14:50.057 --> 14:50.958
-(growling)
-Doc!

14:50.991 --> 14:53.026
-Whoa!
-Get him off me!

14:53.060 --> 14:54.962
(darts striking wall)

14:54.995 --> 14:57.030
-(gun clicks) -Okay, I'm
officially out of darts.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.465
What?! You missed?

14:58.498 --> 15:00.233
Well, you
weren't standing still.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.135
I got a demon kid on my back!

15:02.169 --> 15:03.803
I mean, I got really close
on a couple of them, so...

15:03.836 --> 15:05.905
-(ringtone plays) -It's his mom.
She's video calling me.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.807
-Don't answer.
-I'm not gonna answer.

15:07.840 --> 15:08.908
-(ringtone stops)
-I answered!

15:08.942 --> 15:11.044
-What?!
-Hey, Rose! What's up?

15:11.078 --> 15:12.612
Hi, Jermaine!

15:12.645 --> 15:14.214
He's really into Halloween
this year.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.815
-(Jermaine growling)
-Let me call you back.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.485
-(phone beeps)
-(growling)

15:18.518 --> 15:19.953
(yells)

15:19.987 --> 15:21.154
Damn!

15:22.355 --> 15:24.291
-(spooky laughter)
-(gasping)

15:24.324 --> 15:26.559
(grunts)
God...

15:26.593 --> 15:29.129
My God, he's headed
for those kids.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.167
Is that Mom?

15:34.201 --> 15:36.103
The house had a mom.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.170
(gun clicking)

15:40.140 --> 15:41.808
(Mom snarls)

15:44.611 --> 15:46.146
Lord, if I only do
one thing right

15:46.179 --> 15:50.017
for the rest of my life,
let it be this.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.154
(Max grunting)

15:55.388 --> 15:56.956
Take the shot.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.391
(fires dart)

16:00.227 --> 16:01.328
(exhales)

16:03.363 --> 16:05.098
All right,
so Barry's got the cat,

16:05.132 --> 16:07.100
and he thinks
he has the antidote.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.136
Great. We will see you guys
back at the Bureau.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.104
Great. And you guys
are all okay?

16:11.138 --> 16:12.972
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

16:13.006 --> 16:16.109
It was, uh, you know,
it was pretty intense in there

16:16.143 --> 16:19.179
for a while, but luckily,
I was able to, you know...

16:19.212 --> 16:22.015
like, keep my cool
and be super chill and stuff.

16:22.049 --> 16:24.017
-And Leroy did everything?
-Yeah, pretty much.

16:24.051 --> 16:27.854
Yeah. Uh, well, I guess
I owe you that Midori Sour.

16:27.887 --> 16:30.123
Which still continues
to baffle me.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.658
Oh, yeah.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.293
Well, I was kidding, though.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.862
That's not... I don't...
I don't care about that drink.

16:35.895 --> 16:39.066
-It's gross. -(Annie laughs)
-(engine starts)

16:39.099 --> 16:41.668
MAX:
Dude, that just happened.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.170
-Yeah.
-Okay? We did that.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.971
I can't believe it.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.005
That was us!

16:46.039 --> 16:48.041
-We pulled it off!
-Oh, my God!

16:48.075 --> 16:49.809
-(cackling)
-That was awesome!

16:49.842 --> 16:51.244
I-I feel like The Rock.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.413
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Okay? Like-like Dwayne Johnson,

16:53.446 --> 16:55.014
not the Nick Cage-
Sean Connery movie.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.149
-I know what you meant.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.817
But that movie's badass, so...

16:57.850 --> 16:58.985
-That movie is badass.
-(exhales)

16:59.018 --> 17:00.253
It's hot in here.

17:00.287 --> 17:01.988
You got, uh...

17:02.021 --> 17:03.990
(groaning):
Ah, oh. Actually...

17:04.023 --> 17:05.392
What's wrong? What?

17:05.425 --> 17:07.026
I don't know,
I'm feeling kind of funny, man.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.695
-(exhales)
-Funny?

17:08.728 --> 17:10.197
-(groans)
-Funny like how?

17:10.230 --> 17:11.864
Like, I don't know,
like maybe...

17:11.898 --> 17:13.266
-You...
-Got bit?

17:13.300 --> 17:15.268
-You think you got bit?
-I got bit?

17:15.302 --> 17:16.703
-You think that?
-You said it.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.571
You said. What are you...

17:18.605 --> 17:20.173
-Don't touch me! What are you
doing? -I'm checking!

17:20.207 --> 17:21.274
-Check yourself! Check!
-Oh, my God.

17:21.308 --> 17:22.742
I don't remember getting bit.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.411
How do I... how do I...

17:24.444 --> 17:26.179
how do I look?

17:26.213 --> 17:27.013
You look pale.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.415
But you always look pale.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.883
What do we do, man?
What do you think?

17:34.987 --> 17:36.723
(exhales)

17:36.756 --> 17:39.526
Leroy, thank you.

17:39.559 --> 17:43.196
Duct-taping you to the seat
was legitimately my pleasure.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.098
Listen, before the virus
takes hold

17:45.132 --> 17:47.100
and I start trying
to eat your face,

17:47.134 --> 17:49.236
I just want to say
that Jermaine

17:49.269 --> 17:51.738
is so lucky to have you, man.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.107
I mean, in that case, so am I.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.976
(Leroy grunting)

17:58.678 --> 18:00.880
You know what? I feel fine.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.882
I mean, not a hundred percent,
but I...

18:02.915 --> 18:05.152
I don't know,
I think I'm all right.

18:05.185 --> 18:08.087
Must have just been
low blood sugar or something.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.089
I mean, I did have
half a Baby Ruth for breakfast.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.825
-(tires squealing)
-You okay, man?

18:12.859 --> 18:15.228
If this is some sort of
Halloween prank, it's hilarious,

18:15.262 --> 18:17.964
but you got to keep your eyes
on the road.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.932
(tires squeal)

18:19.966 --> 18:22.735
Whoa! Whoa, Leroy! Oh!

18:22.769 --> 18:25.338
Whoa, Leroy! Leroy!

18:26.606 --> 18:28.141
Aah!

18:29.176 --> 18:31.010
-Whoa!
-(snarling)

18:31.043 --> 18:32.145
Leroy...!

18:38.485 --> 18:41.354
No! No, seat belt!
Seat belt, stay!

18:41.388 --> 18:42.589
-(snarling)
-(screams)

18:42.622 --> 18:45.358
Oh! No! No!

18:45.392 --> 18:46.493
No!

18:48.395 --> 18:50.297
Yeah! Eat it, zombie Leroy!

18:50.330 --> 18:51.998
-Eat it!
-(airbag pops)

18:52.031 --> 18:53.700
-Oh, no, don't eat it.
-(air hissing)

18:53.733 --> 18:55.935
-No, no. Disregard.
-(snarls)

18:55.968 --> 18:58.505
Oh! Aah! Somebody help me!

18:58.538 --> 19:00.373
(syringe hisses)

19:00.407 --> 19:03.510
Well, he wasn't infected long.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.645
Should be fine in no time.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.548
Are you duct-taped to the seat?

19:08.581 --> 19:10.617
Yes, I am. Yeah, I-I...

19:10.650 --> 19:13.520
I was actually about to move
into phase two of my plan,

19:13.553 --> 19:15.555
which was just... to escape,

19:15.588 --> 19:18.124
but then you came along,
so we can just move into that,

19:18.157 --> 19:21.127
uh, that phase a little quicker.
How are you?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.829
Longest night of the year.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.197
Nice work, everyone.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.932
Let's get some sleep.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.040
LaFREY:
I'm sorry to interrupt,

19:34.073 --> 19:37.076
-but... what the hell is this?
-Nothing.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.579
That's clearly not true.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.314
I don't know why I said that.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.049
The infected.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.385
This one is
my old partner's son.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.586
Is he okay?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.020
His vitals check out.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.922
The rest of them seem
to have stabilized.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.691
On the way to a full recovery.

19:51.724 --> 19:55.061
As for me, I got a bit of a rash
from the duct tape.

19:55.094 --> 19:57.163
But I applied calamine
to the affected area--

19:57.196 --> 19:59.499
should be good
in four to six days.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.067
Thank God for that.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.336
Let's report this
as a bacterial infection.

20:03.370 --> 20:06.205
Chalk it up
to party dip gone bad.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.341
Let's get these kids home, okay?

20:08.375 --> 20:10.243
(sighs):
I am gonna go...

20:10.277 --> 20:12.979
do what I do when I'm not here.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.883
What do you think that is?

20:19.319 --> 20:21.288
LEROY:
There he is.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.189
What's up, champ?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.792
I feel... w-weird.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.226
Bet you do after all that.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.296
You know what?
You two should talk.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.798
I'll pop my earbuds in,
lay back--

20:31.831 --> 20:33.633
I am not here.

20:38.104 --> 20:39.939
Listen, man,

20:39.972 --> 20:42.141
sorry I had to be
the bad guy today.

20:42.174 --> 20:45.111
But as much as I want you
to think I'm the coolest,

20:45.144 --> 20:48.214
most badass dude around,
I got to do what's best for you.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.083
That's the promise
I made your dad.

20:51.117 --> 20:54.987
And I'll always do
whatever it takes to keep it.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.724
You understand?

20:57.757 --> 20:59.392
Yeah.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.094
(sighs)
I really miss him.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.431
(exhales)
I know.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.666
I do, too.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.668
But he's always with you...

21:08.701 --> 21:10.303
watching over you.

21:10.337 --> 21:13.473
And I know
he's damn proud of you.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.977
Bee-mo!

21:21.848 --> 21:24.116
You guys...

21:24.150 --> 21:26.118
these earbuds are terrible.

21:26.152 --> 21:29.155
I heard that whole thing,
and it was beautiful.

21:29.188 --> 21:30.857
Truly.

21:33.225 --> 21:34.727
Bee-mo.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.064
Bee-mo.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.100
Bee-mo.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.703
(whispers):
Bee-mo.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.039
Bee-mo-- okay.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.977
What's his deal?

21:51.010 --> 21:56.282
(whispers):
I don't know.
