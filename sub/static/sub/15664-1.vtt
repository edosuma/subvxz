grew up here together,

I would have to say
before we were born.

is buy our refreshments.

even fighting for?

that big a deal.

(CLEARS THROAT)
does not make you from here.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.879

08:38.960 --> 08:40.712
Nothing bad happened.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.153
In fact,
I learned some new moves

08:42.240 --> 08:43.753
from this girl that I battled.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.559
(SIGHS) She was dope.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.153
(CHUCKLES) I think I might
use some of the moves

08:48.240 --> 08:49.912
in my Romeo and Juliet thesis.

08:50.640 --> 08:51.959

a one-track mind.

about dance with you?

it's about you.

to figure out, Erik.

out of school,

10:56.200 --> 10:59.078
and I won't be able to
present my thesis project.

It's our thesis project, and
I'm just as upset as you are.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.195
No, you're not.

Come over,
and we'll talk about it.

MELEA: My tuition is overdue, and I
can't return to class until it's paid.

11:30.280 --> 11:32.032
And what about
your scholarships?

11:32.960 --> 11:34.359
Not enough.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.595
And you weren't
going to tell me?

11:39.800 --> 11:42.678
I mean, you already let me stay here.
You put food on the table.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.671
The least I can
do is handle this.

11:46.280 --> 11:50.353
Melea, you know I will do
anything to help you.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.830
But you have to talk to me.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.790
Well, you know I promised Mom
that I would get my degree.

11:58.760 --> 12:02.070
Ever since I started doing this
Romeo and Juliet thesis...

12:02.640 --> 12:03.629
Phew.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.952
I thought it was the perfect
way to honor her memory.

12:07.760 --> 12:12.595
I'm pretty sure that giving up is
a lousy way to honor your mother.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.552
You're probably right.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.234
And I'm pretty sure
you're gonna beat this.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.515
(SCOFFS)
What makes you so sure?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.991
I screwed everything
up so much already.

12:24.080 --> 12:27.197
Well, you're a smart young lady.
And that's important.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.959
But mostly, you're very
stubborn and thick-headed.

12:32.520 --> 12:33.953
Gee, thanks. (CHUCKLES)

12:34.800 --> 12:38.475

figure it out.

12:47.920 --> 12:48.989
How?

12:50.240 --> 12:52.470
I don't know.
I'll find a space.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.319
I'll mount it myself.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.556
I don't know why it's
so important to you.

12:56.640 --> 12:59.200

something to say, Erik.

I want to do it.

to tell this story,

out to people.

I want to honor her with it.

You will.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.476
Why does it have
to be right now?

13:19.720 --> 13:21.756
I mean, I get it. I'm the
same way with my music,

13:21.840 --> 13:25.833
but I think you need to focus on
money and getting back into school,

13:25.920 --> 13:28.354
and then worry
about your show.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.353
(SIGHS)

13:30.440 --> 13:32.510
I'm gonna figure
out a way to do both.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.034
And costumes, and sets.
It's not cheap.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.997
How're you gonna
afford all that?

13:39.800 --> 13:42.109
Ticket sales, eventually. Oh!

Um... And you're still gonna
help me with the music, right?

You're serious?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.198
I'm dead serious.

But if you pull this off,
then, yes, I'll do the music.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.149
Great.

13:54.360 --> 13:55.998
Now, all I have
to do is find a job,

Oh, it's like that? Okay.

16:04.560 --> 16:05.549
Whoo!

16:07.560 --> 16:09.994
Oh, Crystal, you do not want
to mess with my friend.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.398
Melea is no joke.

16:12.760 --> 16:14.034
Yeah, right. (SCOFFS)

16:16.640 --> 16:19.108
Okay, everybody,
get back to class now.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.519
I don't want
anyone being late.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.753
Go hit those books
like you hit those moves.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.349
Zam, you, too.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.155
I've seen you before.
You are good.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.389
(CHUCKLES) Thank you.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.998
Wow! You really impressed him.

16:39.080 --> 16:42.038
That was his version of rambling.
He never says anything.

16:42.360 --> 16:43.588
He seems like a cool kid.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.950
Oh, he is.
He's just hard to reach.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.155
Hmm.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.832
What are you doing today?

16:48.920 --> 16:52.390
Oh, just a job search, but
they don't have anything here.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.319
Yeah, budget cuts.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.594
Why the need for
money all of a sudden?

16:55.680 --> 16:56.829
For school.

16:56.920 --> 17:00.674
All my scholarships ran out.
And now they want cash.

17:01.360 --> 17:04.238
Welcome to the real world.
Tell me about it.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.152
Okay, well,
I better get inside

17:06.240 --> 17:07.877
before my students
form a coup. Good luck.

17:07.960 --> 17:08.994
Okay, thank you.
Call me.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.194
All right.
Ooh, give me my phone?

17:10.520 --> 17:12.271
Oh, shoot,
I almost forgot.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.310
Here you are. Bye.
Thanks, girl.

Don't ever give up.

it's any of your business,

17:33.200 --> 17:34.758
but I'm taking
a break from school.

17:34.920 --> 17:35.955
Oh!

17:36.040 --> 17:40.352

Bumped down to our level.

I live in this neighborhood.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.758

it a bump-down.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.109
What's your name, girl?

17:48.120 --> 17:50.076
Was gonna ask you
the same thing.

17:50.160 --> 17:53.152

And you should get to know me
before you judge me.

17:59.160 --> 18:02.118
So, what? You want to have me
over for tea or something?

ISHANI: This girl's a trip.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.309

18:07.760 --> 18:09.637
MELEA: Yeah, Taariq.
We're cool.

If you're looking for friends,
go back to America,

find them here.

We got better things to do.

Are you sure about that?

Yeah, I can't believe
you remember me.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.751
Well, you look
just like your mother.

21:00.840 --> 21:03.070
How's she doing?
Is she with you?

21:03.440 --> 21:06.910
Um, no. She passed.
About a year ago.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.719
Oh, Lord. I am sorry.

21:11.120 --> 21:13.076
She was one fine lady.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.037
Yeah, she was.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.798
Hey, I wanted to talk to you
about working here at Bijou.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.792
Is there anything I
can do around here?

21:20.880 --> 21:22.393
Melea, you're too late.

21:22.920 --> 21:25.878
The lady who
just left, uh, Miss Lee,

21:25.960 --> 21:27.632
she's thinking
of buying the place.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.988
Well, you're gonna sell it?
Like, why?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.149
(SIGHS) Because I'm old.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.630
And I ain't made
a dime in years.

but can I ask you a favor?

Okay, now, close your eyes.

How can I look? Your hands
are covering my eyes.

Oh, wow!

21:56.600 --> 21:59.353
This place is amazing.
I know, right?

Well, it needs
a lot of work, but...

and nails won't fix.

would say that,

you telling her your business?

that he kissed you

is the way a brother
kisses his little sister.

famous guy like that

27:47.800 --> 27:50.553
could have any girl
that he wants.

29:11.560 --> 29:12.595
Dajon. How's it going?

29:12.680 --> 29:13.669
Good, yeah.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.591
He's my boyfriend
and composer.

29:15.680 --> 29:17.193
Act one, fight scene.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.077
It's just the first take.

29:20.560 --> 29:21.549
What's wrong?

29:24.040 --> 29:26.873
I mean, this scene
is just not working.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.313
Yeah.
Yeah.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.153
What's not working?

29:30.240 --> 29:34.119
I mean, I don't know. It's... These
kids are in rival gangs, right?

29:34.200 --> 29:37.158
Right, right, and we should
be playing into that, right?

29:37.240 --> 29:40.038
Well, yeah, because when their parents
find out, they're gonna freak.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.109
Yep.

29:41.200 --> 29:44.237
So, maybe we can
sex it up a little?

29:44.320 --> 29:45.469
It's a love scene.

29:45.560 --> 29:48.552
No, he might be right.
Play into the tension.

29:48.680 --> 29:49.669
Yeah.

29:49.760 --> 29:52.638
So, maybe, we can add something
like this, you know, like...

29:52.720 --> 29:54.199
Like there,
and then, maybe, you know...

29:54.280 --> 29:55.349
Mm-hmm.
Something like that.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.590
Yeah? No, it's supposed
to be romantic.

29:58.680 --> 30:00.511
You should do
something like this.

30:02.800 --> 30:03.869
Okay.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.276
All right, well,
that's not bad.

30:08.360 --> 30:09.395
Yeah. It was...
It was perfect.

30:09.480 --> 30:13.268
Oh, if you say so, Romeo.
Melea, let's take five.

30:13.360 --> 30:14.759
Yeah, good idea.
Yeah, take five.

30:14.840 --> 30:15.909
Thanks.
All right.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.109
Take 10.

30:17.800 --> 30:19.028
What was all that about?

30:19.120 --> 30:20.473
What? I don't like the way
you're dancing with him.

30:21.240 --> 30:22.229
You're jealous?

30:22.320 --> 30:24.356
No, I'm not jealous.

30:25.560 --> 30:26.879
Okay, maybe a little.

30:27.640 --> 30:28.993
I'm not exactly his type.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.991
What are you talking about?
You're everyone's type.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.958
Not the kind of guy
that likes other guys.

30:35.880 --> 30:37.518
Oh, right.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.549
Ah, yes. I... I missed that.
(CHUCKLES)

30:40.640 --> 30:42.517
Yeah, that's obvious.
Yeah. Sorry.

30:44.680 --> 30:48.229
Cool. Can we get out of here? Grab
a bite or something? Anything?

30:48.320 --> 30:51.471
I can't. I have to keep
practicing with Dajon,

30:51.560 --> 30:53.596
if I want our chemistry
to be believable, you know?

30:53.680 --> 30:55.159
We're new partners.
Mm-hmm.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.434
So we have to
feel each other out.

30:56.520 --> 30:57.475
Right.

30:57.560 --> 31:00.279
Promise after all this is over,
everything will be different.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.759
Cool. All right.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.279
Bye, guys.
Bye.

Hey.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.110
The ballet, for inspiration.

31:30.600 --> 31:33.876
(CHUCKLES) You know, when Nureyev did
this, they applauded for 40 minutes.

31:33.960 --> 31:37.236
Don't compare yourself. I mean,
you're doing hip-hop, right?

31:37.600 --> 31:38.715
Yeah.

31:39.080 --> 31:42.038
But this is a classic.
It sets the bar.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.588
Yeah, but it
was written, when?

31:45.240 --> 31:47.708
You have to speak
to your audience.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.559
I mean, you got Romeos and
Juliets all over The Flats.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.594
Good, man.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.348
What's up?

32:11.800 --> 32:13.153
Why are we
here, again?

32:13.640 --> 32:16.279
Because I want to change the
tone of our Romeo and Juliet.

32:16.360 --> 32:19.158
I want the reality of
this place to inspire us.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.472
We've got company.

NADINE:
Do you know who that is?

32:26.040 --> 32:28.429
Yeah, I know him.
Who invited him?

32:28.520 --> 32:29.635
Who cares?

32:29.800 --> 32:31.995
My view just got 100% better.

Hey, I didn't know
you would make it.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.278
I listened to that
score you sent me.

32:42.360 --> 32:43.588
Oh, you did?

32:43.680 --> 32:46.399
Oh, like that's not what
you wanted me to do.

32:46.480 --> 32:49.119
I mean, I was hoping so.
Yeah, I figured.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.112
I took a shot at that parting
scene, where you and Romeo split.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.470
Yeah. And I came up with this.

everything worked out.

Listen,
I gotta hit a session,

34:58.480 --> 35:01.313
but I'm having a party Saturday,
if you all wanna stop by.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.549
I'm there.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.834
You can apologize to your
other guests in advance,

35:05.920 --> 35:07.797

able to resist me.

Wow, Nadine. Really?

Shush. He has a private jet.
I can come visit you.

35:14.520 --> 35:18.115
I'm flattered,
but I'm kinda seeing someone.

Damn.
All the good ones are taken.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.470
Hey. I'm a good one.

35:24.320 --> 35:27.153
Ew. You're like my brother.
Don't be weird.

35:27.680 --> 35:29.318
You two are funny.

35:29.720 --> 35:32.393
What about you, Melea?
See you at the party?

35:32.480 --> 35:34.550
I don't know, I have
a lot to do with the show.

35:34.640 --> 35:36.949
I don't know if I can
make it, but I'll try.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.917
Yo, you might meet some folks
who could help you.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.479
And your girl
Ishani will be there.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.912
That's the girl you've been telling
me about? The one we battled?

35:45.000 --> 35:45.989
Yeah.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.593
Now I know
I can't make it.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.477
A'ight, come on.
She's cool.

35:52.160 --> 35:55.596
Talks a lot of trash, but she's
going through some deep shit.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.514
Like what?

35:57.880 --> 36:01.156
Her little brother, Emmanuel,
was killed last year.

36:01.680 --> 36:04.399
Some messed-up gang thing over
a fancy chain he was wearing.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.119
I didn't realize.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.191
Yeah, I know a lot of kids
going through the same thing.

36:09.720 --> 36:11.199
Yeah, it's bad.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.594
So, cut her some slack, maybe.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.714
She could use more
good people in her life.

36:18.760 --> 36:19.829
See ya.

Bye.

save the world" look.

37:17.320 --> 37:18.355
Come in.

37:21.400 --> 37:24.233
I had already written
music for that scene.

37:24.960 --> 37:27.394
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

37:29.520 --> 37:31.556
Babe, you know I
can't do this without you.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.392
You sure seemed like
you were doing fine earlier.

37:35.080 --> 37:36.798
You know what Taj
brings to this project.

37:36.880 --> 37:41.192
Yeah, credibility. I know, I get it.
He's an established artist.

37:41.320 --> 37:43.959
Yeah, but that doesn't change
how I feel about you.

37:44.040 --> 37:45.439
It just seems like
the only thing you care about

37:45.520 --> 37:47.909
is this Romeo and Juliet show.

37:48.840 --> 37:51.070
(CHUCKLES)
Well, it is important to me.

37:51.160 --> 37:54.709
Especially without school, and
being where my mom grew up,

37:54.800 --> 37:58.759
seeing how it is here,
it makes me feel obligated.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.397
Yeah, so you want
me to play the role

38:01.480 --> 38:03.994
of the understanding
boyfriend?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.070
If you don't mind.
Okay. Yeah.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.479
Love you when you're crazy.

38:08.560 --> 38:09.913
I've had plenty of
practice for that.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.911
So, we should be okay.
Thanks.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.629
Besides, there's one thing I know
I can do way better than Taj.

38:15.720 --> 38:17.153

Do you really know
what this play is about?

That's what I thought.
Sit down.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.954
All right, so I'm gonna
give you the lowdown.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.873
So, the Capulets
are Juliet's parents.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.597
They don't get along
with Romeo's parents.

40:20.680 --> 40:25.276
You guys hate each other. It's kind
of like rival gangs in The Flats.

40:25.400 --> 40:27.391
(MUSIC PLAYING)

40:30.600 --> 40:33.353
Everyone knows
the basic plot of the story.

40:34.520 --> 40:37.432
Boy and girl fall in love,
and die in the end.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.150
But it's so much
more than that.

40:48.840 --> 40:53.709
It's a story of forbidden love surrounded
by violence, revenge, and death.

40:54.920 --> 40:59.835
People died basically for no reason,
just like here in The Flats.

41:06.680 --> 41:09.353
And Juliet is in
the middle of it all.

41:09.440 --> 41:12.318
Alone, confused, and afraid.

41:17.280 --> 41:20.795
So, Benvolio and Mercutio,
they're Romeo's friends.

41:20.880 --> 41:24.555
And they get into it with
Tybalt, who is Juliet's cousin.

41:24.640 --> 41:25.755
He's one badass dude.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.432
(ALL CHUCKLING)

41:28.040 --> 41:29.632

41:29.720 --> 41:32.154
on a big rumble
between the families.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.277
Everyone's fighting like it's a
Saturday night in The Flats.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.157
And these fights are sick.

41:37.240 --> 41:39.390
During one of the fights,
Romeo ends up getting killed

41:39.480 --> 41:41.471
by Juliet's
badass cousin, Tybalt.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.272
Eventually,
Romeo gets run out of town

41:43.360 --> 41:44.998
and that makes
things much worse.

41:45.080 --> 41:48.038
But during our
opening fight, this cop,

41:48.120 --> 41:49.633
better known as
the Prince of Verona,

41:49.720 --> 41:51.551
shows up and
breaks up the fight.

41:55.560 --> 41:57.312
He tells them that
the next guy to start a fight

41:57.400 --> 41:59.516
is gonna be punished
with death.

42:00.040 --> 42:01.871
So, they all scatter.

42:03.320 --> 42:05.356
But let's get back to the
Capulets and the Montagues.

42:06.720 --> 42:09.359
Juliet's parents are
talking to this guy, Paris.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.631
He's one of their own,

42:11.720 --> 42:14.632
but he's just a rich guy
that's got his eye on Juliet.

42:14.760 --> 42:16.751
(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

42:22.760 --> 42:24.273
And right then and there,

42:24.360 --> 42:27.591
they tell her that she has to marry
the guy, without even asking.

42:29.240 --> 42:32.391
So, they send out
invites for a party

42:32.480 --> 42:34.152
to get the two
of them together,

42:34.280 --> 42:36.077
and it's Capulets only.

42:51.400 --> 42:55.188
And my man, Romeo, shows up,
steals the invite,

42:55.280 --> 42:58.397
and has the bright idea
of crashing the party.

42:58.480 --> 43:00.710
That's where he meets Juliet.

43:01.280 --> 43:03.475
And it's love at first sight.

43:05.720 --> 43:08.109
And that, folks,
is just the beginning.

43:08.520 --> 43:09.953
Yeah!

Yes.

Bye, Melea.
Bye.

43:15.920 --> 43:17.239
Great stuff today.
Yeah, you, too.

43:17.320 --> 43:18.753
Thank you. Thank you.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.870
All right, see you soon.
Bye, see you soon.

43:20.960 --> 43:23.474
Bye, girl.
Bye.

43:23.560 --> 43:24.709
See you later.
Bye.

43:24.800 --> 43:26.028
Melea?

43:26.120 --> 43:29.396
Just wanted to tell you I'm proud of you.
You're doing a great job.

43:29.520 --> 43:31.909
Thank you, Mr. Diego.
You're welcome.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.594
And I think you can
call me Eduardo now.

43:34.680 --> 43:37.319
Especially since you're in charge.

that I'm missing something.

The piece needs more.

Yes.

A lot of shows have
more than one choreographer.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.316
You need someone with a fresh set of eyes.
A different flair.

43:54.000 --> 43:59.154
Someone with a raw passion. You
find them, and this show will sing.

I just think you could find something
better to do with your time.

Ishani, you keep telling me I could
do so much to help The Flats,

44:30.760 --> 44:34.070
and now that I'm doing it,
you're still not happy.

44:34.160 --> 44:36.196
(SCOFFS) How is helping that
American chick helping us?

44:36.280 --> 44:38.589
Whoa!
Forget I'm American, too?

44:38.680 --> 44:39.999
Not like her.

44:41.440 --> 44:44.352
Look, Melea's got
a lot of kids dancing for her.

Kids who would usually
be out on the streets

44:46.560 --> 44:48.516
getting into trouble
like your...

44:50.240 --> 44:52.993
I'm... Yo, I'm... I'm sorry.

44:53.080 --> 44:54.718
Yeah, you should be.

45:04.200 --> 45:05.997
Rented out a private...

45:06.080 --> 45:07.513
Probably, yes.

45:15.560 --> 45:17.596
Great, right on cue.

45:18.080 --> 45:19.877
Sniffing around
for Taj, I guess.

45:20.240 --> 45:21.992
No, I was actually
coming to see you.

Girl, you need to stay out of
my face before I hurt you.

NADINE: MeMe.

45:26.400 --> 45:27.799
Hey, you made it.

45:27.880 --> 45:29.677
Yeah, I came
to talk to Ishani.

45:30.360 --> 45:32.157
Oh. The kind of talk
where I need

45:32.240 --> 45:34.390
to take off my
shoes and earrings?

45:34.480 --> 45:36.675
Wasn't planning on it.
That's on Ishani.

45:36.760 --> 45:39.274
You need to leave before
you both get a beatdown.

You're not the only one
with friends around here.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.756
Okay, you guys, it's
not going down like that.

45:47.840 --> 45:48.829
Mm.

45:50.760 --> 45:53.399
You need to accept the fact
that I'm not scared of you.

45:53.520 --> 45:55.078
You should be.

45:55.640 --> 45:56.868
Whatever.

45:56.960 --> 45:58.518
Look, I need you
to work on my show.

45:58.920 --> 45:59.989
What?

46:01.240 --> 46:03.071
(CHUCKLES) No, thanks.

46:03.960 --> 46:05.234
Why not?

46:07.040 --> 46:09.031
Do you have
something better to do?

46:09.160 --> 46:11.879
I know your type,
and you're not gonna play me.

You put on a show,
and when it's over,

46:14.480 --> 46:17.790
you take off back to America,
and we're still here.

46:17.920 --> 46:23.153

money, no hope, nowhere to go.

What would work for you?

46:35.160 --> 46:36.718
What would make you happy?

46:36.800 --> 46:38.233
I don't know.

46:38.880 --> 46:41.917
Maybe a rec center,
or a dance hall.

46:43.240 --> 46:46.312
Some place a kid could go and
do something besides drugs.

46:48.600 --> 46:49.669
Then let's do it.

she ain't man enough,

And this must...
This little one. Okay?

01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:58.709
Phew.

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.872
Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.914
Right. You do this
all the time, bro.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.877
I feel like I'm gonna
have a heart attack.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.036
Then before you die,
you should know something.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.709
What?

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.958
You hit like a girl.

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.229
Thanks.

Better?
Better, yes. Thanks.

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.756
All right.
Gotta get to my seat.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.159
All right. Enjoy.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.429
Phew.

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.397
Then it's like...
Okay, round...

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:33.228
So, you ready to get serious?

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.599
Thank you, Mama.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:47.234
Yes, thank you,
Mrs. Mfeke, so much.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.232
So, any last words
for the troops?

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.353
Let's do this.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.556
(ALL CHEERING)

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.352
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Ladies and
gentlemen, please take your seats,

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.670
turn off your cell phones,
and enjoy the show.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.749
Sit down.

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.030
(APPLAUSE)

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.874
For never was a story
of more woe than this,

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:21.269
of Juliet and her Romeo.

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.999
Two young people from
different sides of the track,

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.479
two lovers star-crossed.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:31.032
Now, Romeo, being a Montague,
and Juliet, being a Capulet,

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.475
meant that their love
could never be accurate.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.359
Their families
were sworn enemies,

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.351
so them being in love
would just add to it.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.753
The ongoing fights about
who's wrong and right,

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.957
but after all these years, still,
two wrongs don't make a right.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.353
Sharing a love strong
enough to die and kill for,

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.590
the kind of love that everyone
should try and live for.

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:54.032
So, please, if you will,
open eyes, all attend,

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.759
the show must begin, but
I'll be back before it ends.

No, Mama. It's so much more.

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.229
It's insane.

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.593
Ishani, you okay, baby?

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:44.591
You want me to get some
revenge on Romeo over there?

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.908
Nah, it's cool.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.558
Hey, you okay?

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:52.876
What's wrong? Nothing at all.
I'm fine.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:56.837
Guess I just can't believe that
this is all finally happening.

01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.033
I wish my mom
could've seen it.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:06.833

all of this for the stage.

have violent ends,

drawing swords,
spilling blood.

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.112
Vicious brawls over grudges.

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:37.673
Vengeance and
rage lead to death,

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.591
leaving no room
for discussions.

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:43.078
Banished for his actions,
Romeo has got to leave.

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:46.837
Will they ever be together? We'll
just have to wait and see.

Nah, she's just faking.

Things have come full circle
in the state of despair.

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:36.353
Juliet holds the solution in
her hand and just stares.

Slowly dancing
with the potion,

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.752
yeah, she's going
through the motions.

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:44.709
A selfless sacrifice, hoping
the gates of love will open.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:47.917
Ready to die for her love,
ready to rise up above.

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.874
Putting an end to all the pain is
all she's hoping that it does.

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.271
So, will Romeo come save his
only love before her time's out?

01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.313
Will true love prevail?

still don't have a space.

that will be a problem.

a permanent dance center,

The community
needs this place.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.835
That's great, but what
made you change your mind?

01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:29.633
Consider it
a charitable gesture.

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:32.553
Yeah. Her company wants
to have the appearance
