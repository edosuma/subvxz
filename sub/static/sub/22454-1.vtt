'This is fucking wicked.

00:30.757 --> 00:33.476
'I'm almost definitely a musical genius. '

00:34.517 --> 00:36.348
# This is outrageous

00:36.397 --> 00:39.355
# This is contagious
Yeah?

00:39.397 --> 00:41.752
'Maybe a tattoo on my chest.

00:41.797 --> 00:43.833
'But of my face.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.186
'Yeah. Double me!

00:46.237 --> 00:48.228
'Feel it. '

00:48.277 --> 00:50.745
# So futile... #

00:50.797 --> 00:53.357
'She's on there. '

00:53.397 --> 00:57.026
'Got to get the same bus home.
Don't go. Almost there.

00:58.397 --> 01:01.389
'Yes. I am the lord of the bus, said he.

01:02.957 --> 01:04.549
'Where is she?

01:04.596 --> 01:06.747
'Knickers, she's not on. '

01:06.797 --> 01:08.469
- Hey, Mark.
- Sophie!

01:08.517 --> 01:11.748
- We must stop meeting like this.
- Heh, yeah.

01:11.797 --> 01:14.265
I was... running. Were you... running?

01:14.317 --> 01:18.515
- Right behind you. I shouted but...
- Of course. Stupid... music.

01:18.557 --> 01:21.151
- Why don't you...?
- What did you make of...?

01:21.197 --> 01:23.870
'Oh, no, shit, she's... I should say.

01:24.477 --> 01:27.389
'No, too late. Already it's too late.

01:27.437 --> 01:29.997
'Maybe if we hit a bump I can slip it out.

01:30.037 --> 01:32.073
'Or keep shtoom, ride it out.

01:32.117 --> 01:36.110
'Gonna need to waggle eventually
to keep the circulation going. '

01:36.157 --> 01:38.148
God, there's something Mark...

01:38.197 --> 01:40.108
- Your hand!
- Er, oh.

01:41.277 --> 01:45.509
I was gonna say but... I just... Sorry.

01:45.557 --> 01:47.548
No, no, it's fine.

01:48.757 --> 01:51.635
'Of course, she's giving you the book-off.

01:51.677 --> 01:55.306
'Women don't want your hand
under their bottoms, Mark.

01:55.357 --> 01:57.951
'That's been established, that's a given.

01:57.997 --> 02:00.875
"'She sat on it, officer,
it was an accident. "

02:00.917 --> 02:05.195
"'Of course it was, now get in
with the nonces. " What a disaster. '

02:07.717 --> 02:11.187
Oi, mate, er, can I have
some of your Coke?

02:11.237 --> 02:14.673
'They'll trap me
and their brothers will hack me to... '

02:14.717 --> 02:16.708
- I said, can I have...
- Here.

02:16.757 --> 02:19.191
- Look, he's a paedo!
- Paedo!

02:19.237 --> 02:22.752
'You're not a paedo.
You're definitely not a paedo. '

02:22.797 --> 02:24.753
Go home, man!

02:24.797 --> 02:29.268
'Those kids have no idea whatsoever
of what went on at Stalingrad.

02:29.317 --> 02:32.787
'Although I can in no way
compare my struggle reading it

02:32.837 --> 02:34.828
'with that of the Red Army,

02:34.877 --> 02:36.868
'it has been a very big read. '

02:36.917 --> 02:40.307
I'm basically wanting to meet someone
like myself.

02:40.357 --> 02:43.349
'That's the opposite
of what I'm looking for. '

02:43.397 --> 02:45.388
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

02:47.317 --> 02:52.755
Now I know how whatshisname
felt when he finished the Mona Lisa.

02:52.797 --> 02:56.346
Knackered. So how was your day?

02:56.957 --> 02:58.436
Shit.

02:58.477 --> 03:01.037
Well, Toni came round to drop this off.

03:01.757 --> 03:03.554
Oh. A party.

03:03.597 --> 03:06.316
Did you, you know, make your move?

03:06.357 --> 03:10.669
No, no. She was going to Starbucks
to read a book. It's one of her things.

03:10.717 --> 03:15.427
Besides, the move... it's not a whole
Sophie uptight situation.

03:15.477 --> 03:19.595
We're just gradually sliding into
a fuck buddy scenario.

03:19.637 --> 03:23.232
- Fuck buddy?
- Yeah. A buddy you can fuck.

03:23.277 --> 03:27.793
We're both so relaxed about sex. Last
time I was there, we watched a porno.

03:27.837 --> 03:30.146
Four in the afternoon, just me and her.

03:30.197 --> 03:32.188
I mean, that's me.

03:32.237 --> 03:36.150
I'm not ready for the kind of thing
you're after. The whole...

03:36.197 --> 03:39.587
- someone to go to Waitrose with.
- Yeah, I suppose.

03:39.637 --> 03:43.027
'I don't want to go to Waitrose,
I want a fuck buddy. '

03:43.077 --> 03:47.707
'I wish I was her fuck buddy
next door, we'd do it through the wall. '

03:47.757 --> 03:50.555
- How thick is wall?
- Depends.

03:50.597 --> 03:53.873
So, er, which Starbucks does she go to?

03:55.837 --> 03:59.910
'Come on, come on, piss off.
I want to go to the shop.

03:59.957 --> 04:02.869
'Need a poo, got to have loo paper.

04:02.917 --> 04:07.195
'I should be able to walk out of
my own door. What's wrong with me?

04:07.237 --> 04:10.786
'Be great if a car just ploughed
into the lot of them.

04:10.837 --> 04:12.793
'Twisted broken bones. '

04:12.837 --> 04:15.795
Jesus, Mark! Are you OK?

04:15.837 --> 04:17.987
Hi, Toni. I'm fine. I was just...

04:18.036 --> 04:20.107
checking the letter box for...

04:20.156 --> 04:24.389
Sometimes they get stuck in there
and next thing your phone's cut off.

04:24.437 --> 04:25.836
Right.

04:25.877 --> 04:28.869
You know they haven't got Alpen
at that corner shop?

04:28.917 --> 04:31.750
- No.
- I said, "Have you got any Alpen?"

04:31.797 --> 04:35.346
He said, "No. "
I said, "Are you going to order any in?"

04:35.397 --> 04:38.355
- And he said he didn't know.
- That is a bit crap.

04:38.397 --> 04:41.753
It's ridiculous!
What kind of shop doesn't have Alpen?

04:41.797 --> 04:44.265
- I don't know.
- 'Go on. '

04:44.317 --> 04:46.911
I've got Alpen!

04:47.597 --> 04:50.634
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I mean, you can have some.

04:50.677 --> 04:53.271
'What are you doing?
What about the poo? '

04:54.637 --> 04:56.628
'Lf I can just... hold it in.

04:56.677 --> 04:58.827
'I think it's retreating. '

04:58.877 --> 05:02.028
So, here we are then. Bowl o' Alpen.

05:02.077 --> 05:06.707
Makes me think of skiing holidays.
We always used to go skiing.

05:06.757 --> 05:09.146
- Me, my mum, my sister.
- Wicked.

05:09.197 --> 05:12.109
I've got a sister. She's a lawyer, actually.

05:12.157 --> 05:13.590
'Don't boast. '

05:13.637 --> 05:15.673
What does your sister do?

05:15.717 --> 05:18.709
Not much. She's got leukaemia.

05:18.757 --> 05:21.396
'That's what you get for trying to flirt. '

05:21.437 --> 05:23.507
That's terrible. I'm so sorry.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.388
I suppose...

05:25.437 --> 05:27.428
I mean, at least it's not cancer.

05:27.477 --> 05:29.547
It's a form of cancer.

05:29.597 --> 05:32.236
Shit. That's terrible.

05:32.277 --> 05:35.110
My gran... died of cancer.

05:35.997 --> 05:39.148
Although, hopefully, your sister... won't.

05:40.397 --> 05:44.993
Obviously. Listen, let's talk about
something else. Something fun.

05:45.037 --> 05:48.825
Do you like Blackadder?
I got the Blackadder set for Christmas.

05:48.877 --> 05:52.790
- I never really...
- No, sure, forget it. Terrible idea.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.672
I know. I know something funny.

05:56.717 --> 05:58.309
# This is outrageous!

05:58.357 --> 06:00.473
# This is contagious!#

06:00.517 --> 06:02.985
And he's been working on it for a month!

06:03.037 --> 06:06.074
- # So futile... #
- Wait, this is the best bit.

06:06.117 --> 06:09.553
# Waaaaaaaaaah!#

06:10.557 --> 06:13.833
'This Grammy goes out
to my homeboys in Compton,

06:13.877 --> 06:16.914
'the Japanese people
who mean so much to me.

06:16.957 --> 06:20.472
'Mark's playing my track!
He can't get enough of that shit. '

06:20.517 --> 06:23.509
#... dangerous!#

06:25.557 --> 06:28.230
- Jez.
- What's going...?

06:28.277 --> 06:30.268
Toni. I...

06:30.797 --> 06:33.265
# And it's dangerous

06:34.237 --> 06:35.636
# Keep away from it... #

06:37.477 --> 06:40.833
'Great idea, Mark.
Humiliate your best mate just to...

06:40.877 --> 06:44.028
'Why didn't we play Othello?

06:44.077 --> 06:46.068
'I'd love to bang her.

06:46.117 --> 06:49.996
'Just buckle down, do your time,
like Leslie Grantham. '

06:50.037 --> 06:52.028
Hey, Jez, you're up.

06:52.077 --> 06:54.511
Yes, that's right. I'm up.

06:54.557 --> 06:58.835
I'm making chicken tikka.
Plus I've bought us loads of great stuff.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.914
Dune on DVD, Bakewell slices,

07:01.957 --> 07:03.754
gin, and...

07:03.797 --> 07:05.788
Sara Lee.

07:07.357 --> 07:10.713
Plus I was thinking -
you know that 30 quid you owe me?

07:10.757 --> 07:13.112
Let's call it quits, yeah?

07:13.157 --> 07:15.432
I mean, not quits but, you know...

07:18.597 --> 07:22.510
I'm just really, really, really, really sorry,
Jeremy.

07:22.557 --> 07:27.347
'Does he mind? Maybe nobody
minds about things as much as me. '

07:27.397 --> 07:31.072
Cos it was only a balls-up. I ballsed up.
And now we're fine.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.666
This'll be ready soon. We can eat it
in front of Hitler's Henchmen.

07:34.717 --> 07:36.628
Yeah.

07:36.677 --> 07:39.237
Listen, you know Kerry, cancer Kerry?

07:39.277 --> 07:42.269
- Yeah?
- I need to find out for a friend

07:42.317 --> 07:46.515
the name of that Chinese doctor she was
raving about. Can you remember?

07:46.557 --> 07:48.195
Sure.

07:49.997 --> 07:53.228
It was Dr Ying Fu Yip.

07:54.237 --> 07:56.228
Wang Shong.

07:57.597 --> 07:59.474
Pang Fang Wang

07:59.517 --> 08:01.826
Dang Dong Ning Po Ku.

08:02.557 --> 08:04.548
Oh, right.

08:04.597 --> 08:06.906
I see. I get it.

08:06.957 --> 08:09.073
You were lampooning me.

08:09.117 --> 08:11.426
It was a simple lampoon.

08:12.117 --> 08:15.234
- Hey, Jez, what's up, man?
- Super Hans.

08:16.637 --> 08:19.629
Pint of Guinness, please.
No logo on the foam.

08:19.677 --> 08:22.145
- No logo?
- You don't buy into that, do ya?

08:22.197 --> 08:26.031
The old, "Ooh, I've got a clover
in me foam.

08:26.077 --> 08:28.068
"I'm so important. " No.

08:28.117 --> 08:33.111
What you're doing there is you're
drinking an advert, ain't ya, eh, shithead?

08:33.157 --> 08:35.591
- Thank you.
- Right.

08:35.636 --> 08:38.788
- So you got our track?
- Er, no.

08:38.837 --> 08:41.111
I've been thinking, I'm not sure.

08:41.157 --> 08:43.546
I think maybe it's shit.

08:43.597 --> 08:46.634
Whoa. Hold it, cowboy. Rewind. Wash it.

08:46.677 --> 08:49.953
The track's shit?
Jez, the track's THE shit.

08:49.997 --> 08:53.034
It's just I found Mark laughing at it.

08:53.077 --> 08:57.070
What, so, Mr fuckin' Ocean Colour Pants
don't get it?

08:57.117 --> 08:58.675
Quelle fuckin' surprise.

08:58.717 --> 09:01.277
Plus he was doing it in front of Toni.

09:01.317 --> 09:03.956
Mate, you gotta get some rewengay.

09:03.997 --> 09:05.589
He broke omertà.

09:05.637 --> 09:07.628
- You think?
- Listen,

09:07.677 --> 09:11.033
the whole industry is run
by suits like your mate.

09:11.077 --> 09:14.547
- Is that why we haven't got a deal?
- Course. They're all Marks.

09:14.597 --> 09:17.714
Sitting at marble desks,
ties done up to eleven,

09:17.757 --> 09:20.749
clicking their fingers
to the Lighthouse Family,

09:20.797 --> 09:23.152
getting their dick sucked by an Alsatian.

09:23.197 --> 09:24.676
Yeah?

09:24.717 --> 09:28.107
They're all perverts, mate.
All in with each other.

09:28.157 --> 09:30.591
It's not who you know, it's who you blow.

09:31.517 --> 09:33.109
Right.

09:33.157 --> 09:35.591
'So Toni scares me.

09:35.637 --> 09:39.869
'I can have a relationship with someone
that scares me. Look at me and Dad. '

09:39.917 --> 09:42.715
'Oh, shit. Relax, relax, it's OK.

09:42.757 --> 09:47.387
'You're not a paedo, you're just a normal
man walking past some simple children. '

09:47.437 --> 09:50.076
- Hi there.
- Look, it's Clean Shirt.

09:50.117 --> 09:52.870
'Clean Shirt? Isn't that good? '

09:52.917 --> 09:57.593
- How do you get that shirt so clean?
- 'Use the power of reason. '

09:57.637 --> 10:02.916
Look, I know it must be difficult
being a kid. Not a lot of schemes.

10:02.957 --> 10:06.711
But... You know, I'm not the borough.
I wish I was but...

10:06.757 --> 10:10.636
- Fuck off, Clean Shirt.
- I'm just a man. Can't we just...?

10:10.677 --> 10:13.191
Hey, no! No! Kicking's not...

10:13.237 --> 10:16.035
Don't kick my foot! That's my... Stop it!

10:16.077 --> 10:18.716
Don't kick my foot!

10:21.117 --> 10:23.585
'Me and Toni, Toni and me.

10:23.637 --> 10:27.152
'When his kooky charm starts to cloy,
I'll be there.

'Fuck buddy number two.

'Great. Wait for the crumbs to fall
while my nuts slowly shrivel.

10:33.157 --> 10:35.466
'Actually, I hope they do shrivel... '

10:35.517 --> 10:37.508
- Oh!
- What's the matter?

10:37.557 --> 10:40.435
I thought you liked pork.

10:40.477 --> 10:43.071
How did...? What does it mean?

10:43.117 --> 10:45.426
It means... omertà.

10:45.477 --> 10:47.832
It means rewengay.

10:47.877 --> 10:52.029
I'm sorry, OK? I'm sorry I humiliated you
in front of Toni.

10:52.077 --> 10:55.387
Don't think I can't see you
trying to get a slice of my action

10:55.437 --> 10:57.428
because Sophie won't put out.

10:57.477 --> 11:02.267
Oh, the gloves are off? Perhaps you
should know what I think of your music.

11:02.317 --> 11:05.229
Well, let's have some more truth,
shall we?

11:05.277 --> 11:07.916
Cos the truth is you're a posh spaz.

11:07.957 --> 11:11.791
Oh, really? I'd love to know
in what way I am a posh spaz.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.476
In the way that you do
posh spazzy things

11:14.517 --> 11:17.350
like tidying up and ironing your socks.

11:17.397 --> 11:19.388
I do not iron my socks.

11:19.437 --> 11:21.507
Socks, shirt, whatever.

11:27.037 --> 11:30.791
'I'm going to the party
and I'll get her in the end.

11:30.837 --> 11:34.512
'I have the power of the brain -
the most erotic muscle.

11:34.557 --> 11:38.072
'A longbow beats the crossbow,
my idiotic friend. '

11:42.237 --> 11:45.149
Hey, look, just lay off.

11:45.877 --> 11:48.949
- That's my bit of lager!
- Oh, I get it.

11:48.997 --> 11:52.114
- Are you gonna do me in?
- Don't be ridiculous.

11:52.157 --> 11:55.945
Are you gonna punch me, Mark?
Is that what's going to happen?

11:55.997 --> 11:59.114
You just... You... You're lucky I don't...

11:59.157 --> 12:02.035
- You're just very lucky.
- You're an animal.

12:02.077 --> 12:04.307
You keep your tie done up to eleven

12:04.357 --> 12:08.145
otherwise all this grey office envy sludge
will spill out.

12:08.197 --> 12:10.188
And you've got weird nuts!

12:10.237 --> 12:12.512
What? How did you...?

12:12.557 --> 12:17.426
If you're watching TV in your dressing
gown, you should put some pants on.

12:22.317 --> 12:25.354
So I'm glad we cleared the air.

12:25.397 --> 12:26.989
Me too.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.631
I feel better. Much better.

12:29.677 --> 12:31.668
Like a weight has been lifted.

12:31.717 --> 12:34.311
Me too. That's exactly how I feel.

12:38.237 --> 12:41.274
Hey, hey, hey. It's the guys.

12:41.317 --> 12:43.308
Come on in.

12:47.197 --> 12:49.188
So... Toni's friends.

12:49.237 --> 12:51.671
Who, what, why, and where?

12:51.717 --> 12:54.629
Well, that's the fun - I don't know anyone!

12:54.677 --> 12:57.475
- These are our neighbours.
- Neighbours?

12:57.517 --> 12:59.633
Did you think I'd invited friends?

12:59.677 --> 13:02.669
You know who your friends are when
you set fire to Hampton Court maze

13:02.717 --> 13:04.708
because you can't take
your husband's shit.

13:04.757 --> 13:08.545
It's great to know your neighbours,
not just for security...

13:08.597 --> 13:11.111
Right, exactly. Drinks?

13:11.157 --> 13:12.875
Wicked.

13:15.157 --> 13:19.150
'If I laugh at everything she says,
I'll at least get a suck job. '

13:20.317 --> 13:24.708
'I should forget it, leave her
to him. Concentrate on the long game.

13:24.757 --> 13:27.555
'Work on a six-pack by Christmas, then...

13:27.597 --> 13:32.910
'Why should I? We had something going
when we were laughing at Jeremy. '

13:32.957 --> 13:36.233
'Oh, too late. They're bonding. '

13:37.397 --> 13:42.346
- What's funny? It's a fridge magnet.
- I know but it looks just like a fried egg.

13:46.277 --> 13:47.949
'Heh-heh. Twot. '

13:50.397 --> 13:53.628
But if I pull out now,
that's the deposit gone.

13:53.677 --> 13:55.827
Right. Nightmare.

13:55.877 --> 13:59.552
- On the other hand...
- 'How did I get trapped with her?

13:59.597 --> 14:01.986
'She's the most boring person here.

14:02.037 --> 14:08.431
'They look great. They might be talking
about making a porno. I'll do the music. '

14:08.477 --> 14:11.150
So where do you live in the building?

14:11.197 --> 14:13.836
Oh, I don't live here, I'm Toni's sister.

14:13.877 --> 14:17.995
- And what do you do?
- I work in the music business.

14:18.037 --> 14:20.028
You do?

14:20.797 --> 14:24.710
Well, that's amazing.
That's just really amazing.

14:24.757 --> 14:27.430
Everyone writes down
someone famous.

14:27.477 --> 14:29.945
We swap, put them on our foreheads,

14:29.997 --> 14:35.276
and you work out who we are by asking
questions. It's really funny because...

14:35.317 --> 14:37.672
Anyway, let's just play.

14:38.837 --> 14:42.432
'Heh-heh. Yeah, this is it.
Paula's gonna love this.

14:42.477 --> 14:44.468
'Very Iggy. '

14:46.917 --> 14:50.387
No, when you've finished,
drop your Rizla in the bowl.

14:50.437 --> 14:53.270
Oh. Er, I'll... Could I do mine again?

14:53.317 --> 14:55.706
We're not playing for points, mate.

14:55.757 --> 14:57.987
Come on, just drop it in, old chap.

14:58.717 --> 15:00.435
That's it.

15:00.477 --> 15:04.311
- I give up.
- No, don't. Just one... This one's mine.

15:04.357 --> 15:07.349
- Tim Henman?
- Yeah, how did you...?

15:07.397 --> 15:11.310
- Jeremy, have you worked out your...?
- Don't even go there.

15:11.357 --> 15:14.633
It is literally impossible.
I'm just someone's secretary.

15:14.677 --> 15:19.114
- The Home Secretary, Jeremy.
- Yeah, right, whatever.

15:19.157 --> 15:21.876
- We're popping next door.
- You're going?

15:21.917 --> 15:24.272
'The coast is clear! '

15:24.317 --> 15:27.468
Yeah, I'm taking Paula
to listen to my work.

15:27.517 --> 15:30.714
She seems like she'd appreciate
a good track.

15:30.757 --> 15:34.147
Cool! Don't do anything
I wouldn't do, sis. Ha-ha!

15:34.197 --> 15:36.916
Which leaves her a hell of a lot of leeway!

15:36.957 --> 15:39.915
'Heh-heh-heh. I am in here!

15:39.957 --> 15:42.471
'Sis... Sister! Shit! '

15:42.517 --> 15:44.428
Excuse me.

15:44.477 --> 15:49.551
- Jez, can I have a word?
- Yeah, I'm going, the coast is clear.

15:49.597 --> 15:53.306
I don't expect you'll get very far
but by all means have a pop.

15:53.357 --> 15:56.190
I thought I'd better tell you. Paula, she's...

15:56.237 --> 15:58.228
She has cancer.

15:58.277 --> 16:00.871
What? Are you serious?

16:00.917 --> 16:04.671
I thought I'd better mention it.
You don't wanna drop a clanger.

16:04.717 --> 16:06.309
No. Right.

16:07.037 --> 16:08.550
Blimey.

16:08.597 --> 16:10.428
Is it Jamie Oliver?

16:10.477 --> 16:13.230
Look, you're a cockmuncher, OK?

16:14.517 --> 16:16.473
# Feel it, yeah#

16:16.517 --> 16:20.795
'You can't catch cancer.
I'd have heard. Someone would've said. '

16:20.837 --> 16:23.226
OK, I think I've heard enough.

16:25.637 --> 16:28.754
- Yeah. It's OK.
- Do you really think so?

16:28.797 --> 16:31.948
'What kind? Blood? Bone? Knee? Face? '

16:31.997 --> 16:34.670
- Yeah, I mean, I like it.
- Great!

16:34.717 --> 16:36.673
I mean, that's great.

16:36.717 --> 16:42.110
But I'm guessing you didn't invite me
to your room just to listen to some tape.

16:42.157 --> 16:45.274
'Shit. Of Course. "It's who you blow. "'

16:45.317 --> 16:49.310
No. No, sure. I know the rules.

16:49.357 --> 16:52.952
Yeah, let's get it on... baby.

16:55.117 --> 16:57.267
Barry.

16:57.317 --> 17:02.311
That guy is one serious power tripper.
He was all over my Rizla game.

17:02.357 --> 17:05.473
'OK, Mark, you asked for it,
now you've got it.

17:05.517 --> 17:09.669
'She's looking for a fuck buddy.
Change gears, sauce things up. '

17:09.717 --> 17:13.425
He's just so, "Yah, take the A304."

17:13.477 --> 17:16.867
I mean, yes! We can see your hairy chest.

17:16.916 --> 17:18.907
And no, we're not impressed!

17:18.957 --> 17:24.634
Yeah, so, er, Jeremy tells me
you two watched a porno together.

17:24.676 --> 17:26.667
You know, I'd be into...

17:26.717 --> 17:28.947
No, that was The English Patient.

17:28.997 --> 17:32.785
'Ha! What an idiotic boob.
He's out, I'm in.

17:32.837 --> 17:35.590
'Now, what's my shtick? Yeah... '

17:35.637 --> 17:41.428
You know, the Red Army shot 16,000
of their own men at Stalingrad.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.069
OK.

17:43.117 --> 17:47.110
And of course, the majority of
the Wehrmacht had no winter clothing.

17:47.157 --> 17:49.148
'I'm the tank commander now, Barry. '

17:49.197 --> 17:53.475
I know how they feel. You buy classic
but classic keeps changing.

17:54.677 --> 17:57.908
See, by the winter of '42,

17:57.957 --> 18:00.425
the whole city was surrounded

18:00.477 --> 18:02.468
by the massed Sixth Army.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.633
It was pressing...

18:05.677 --> 18:08.032
and pressing.

18:08.077 --> 18:12.514
The Russians couldn't hold on
much longer. Many wanted to submit.

18:12.557 --> 18:16.789
Mark, I don't just bang anyone.
I'm not some next-door fuck jar.

18:17.517 --> 18:19.906
No. No, of course not.

18:20.957 --> 18:25.508
What I mean is that the German
supply lines were stretched.

18:25.557 --> 18:27.946
Zhukov countered...

18:27.997 --> 18:29.988
and the siege was broken.

18:31.717 --> 18:35.232
And that's all the story of Stalingrad.

18:36.517 --> 18:39.907
'You're a sunshine coach,
bringing a last smile to... '

18:39.957 --> 18:43.791
Erm, if we've got to do this,
do you mind keeping the hat on?

18:43.837 --> 18:45.793
It's just...

18:45.837 --> 18:48.795
- Sorry.
- We don't have to do anything, Jeremy.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.112
- No?
- No.

18:51.157 --> 18:54.035
I mean, I don't mind. I'd just rather not...

18:54.077 --> 18:57.387
We could take Polaroids of me,
you know, all excited

18:57.437 --> 18:59.905
and you could take them away...

18:59.957 --> 19:03.791
I am very keen to sort you out,
so to speak.

19:05.797 --> 19:07.230
'That was embarrassing.

19:07.277 --> 19:10.587
"'Not a fuck jar".
Don't dwell. No need to dwell.

19:10.637 --> 19:13.515
'Think charming, considerate. '

19:14.197 --> 19:17.428
So your sister,
she looks great considering...

19:17.477 --> 19:20.116
Considering what?
She doesn't have any dress sense?

19:20.157 --> 19:23.832
No. You know, the whole thing,
the leukaemia.

19:23.877 --> 19:27.711
Oh, no, that's not Paula.
Paula's my half-sister.

19:27.757 --> 19:32.626
Paula's doing fine! Except her idea
of a present is a bunch of CD singles,

19:32.677 --> 19:35.316
and I do know you get them for free.

19:35.357 --> 19:40.385
Toni, we're dry. I was thinking someone
should run to the offy before it shuts.

19:40.437 --> 19:43.668
'The second front.
I can win on the second front.

19:43.717 --> 19:47.312
'This is perfect. I'm gonna be
the knight on horseback

19:47.357 --> 19:51.396
'with an armful of booze and enough
nachos to feed the Mexican army.

19:51.437 --> 19:55.828
'Oh, shit. Shit! Fuck off.
Why don't you fuck the fuck off?

19:55.877 --> 19:59.233
'Just run the gauntlet.
The little bastards will...

19:59.277 --> 20:01.586
'It's gonna shut as well. '

20:01.637 --> 20:03.593
Er, excuse me, mate.

20:03.637 --> 20:06.026
Er, sorry to bother you.

20:06.077 --> 20:08.307
This is a bit embarrassing, really.

20:08.357 --> 20:12.111
You couldn't possibly buy me
a couple of bottles of wine?

20:12.157 --> 20:14.512
Pinot grigio, maybe. Or...

20:14.557 --> 20:17.151
Oi! Look, it's that paedo!

20:17.197 --> 20:18.516
- Ha-haaa!
- Paedo.

20:21.197 --> 20:23.757
But on the song, do you really like it?

20:23.797 --> 20:26.550
Yeah, it's hard to get that excited about.

20:26.597 --> 20:28.713
I guess you're not
in the right frame of mind...

20:28.757 --> 20:31.112
'Don't go on about it. Jesus. '

20:31.157 --> 20:34.752
- Are you gonna do more work on it?
- 'How much time has she got? '

20:34.797 --> 20:38.836
Maybe. I mean, how long are you
planning to... stay in your job?

20:38.877 --> 20:42.028
- Oh, you know, as long as I last.
- Right.

20:44.317 --> 20:48.674
- Look, should you be doing that?
- Probably not. But, you know, fuck it.

20:48.717 --> 20:50.833
Jesus.

20:50.877 --> 20:53.675
You know, I do think you're brave.

20:54.597 --> 20:57.794
I just think you're very, very brave.

20:57.837 --> 21:00.635
I make my decisions, I stick by them.

21:01.517 --> 21:05.749
Everybody said you couldn't market
acid jazz to the over 30s,

21:05.797 --> 21:08.675
and I was like, "Fuck that shit. "

21:09.917 --> 21:13.956
Listen to you, you beautiful, crazy thing.

21:14.597 --> 21:16.588
I meant the cancer.

21:17.397 --> 21:19.388
I'm sorry... which cancer?

21:19.437 --> 21:21.553
The bloody cancer eating you away.

21:22.437 --> 21:24.393
OK.

21:24.437 --> 21:27.588
Would you like it if I did have cancer?

21:27.637 --> 21:30.197
'I bet Zhukov
would've got booze. Oh. '

21:31.757 --> 21:36.467
Oh. You're back. I think it's winding
down a bit now, actually, mate.

21:36.517 --> 21:39.509
- 'Bastard. '
- Oh, yeah, very funny!

21:39.557 --> 21:43.106
I suppose you think cancer is just
this huge practical joke!

21:43.157 --> 21:46.274
What? Oh, Jeremy, I'm so sorry.

21:46.317 --> 21:48.467
- I thought...
- You're quite the guy.

21:48.517 --> 21:52.715
Certainly not the kind of sicko
to ruin someone's music career

21:52.757 --> 21:56.306
by suggesting that certain people
have cancer.

21:56.357 --> 21:59.588
What joke is next?
"Hey, Jez, your mum's dead!"

21:59.637 --> 22:01.832
- Bloody hilarious.
- What's going on?

22:01.877 --> 22:04.949
I accidentally told him Paula had cancer.

22:04.997 --> 22:10.230
Jeremy, Mark got it wrong. He thought
Paula was ill. She's not, it was a mistake.

22:10.277 --> 22:13.474
I'm sure Kerry would be rolling
round the floor

22:13.517 --> 22:17.351
except she's head to toe
in acupuncture needles.

22:17.397 --> 22:22.425
I made a mistake. You wouldn't give
the name of the doctor for Toni's sister.

22:22.477 --> 22:24.547
He wouldn't give the name for Sal?

22:25.597 --> 22:30.193
What's the big deal? So I didn't give him
the number for Dr Tang?

22:30.237 --> 22:36.267
She's got leukaemia. Sticking a few
needles in her face is not gonna fix that.

22:38.357 --> 22:41.747
OK. I think it's time for you boys

22:41.797 --> 22:44.231
to fuck off now. Hmm?

22:50.877 --> 22:54.995
Well, really, really nice to catch up, Soph.
See you tomorrow?

22:55.037 --> 22:57.392
- Tomorrow. Great.
- 'Yeah, that's the way.

22:57.437 --> 22:59.314
'Sophie's the one.

22:59.357 --> 23:02.872
'Toni is Russia -
vast, mysterious, unconquerable.

23:02.917 --> 23:07.627
'Sophie is Poland - manageable,
won't put up too much of a fight.

23:08.437 --> 23:10.997
'Shit. Oh, shit. '

23:11.037 --> 23:14.825
- It's paedo!
- 'OK, you want some, do you?

23:14.877 --> 23:16.993
'Do you want a taste of my steel? '

23:26.837 --> 23:30.307
# And did those feet in ancient times

23:30.357 --> 23:34.908
# Feel it!
# Walk upon England's pastures green

23:34.957 --> 23:37.312
# Rah!
# Outrageous

23:37.357 --> 23:39.348
# Ah, yeah!

23:39.397 --> 23:41.592
# Uh! Uh! Eeh! Oh!

23:41.637 --> 23:43.628
# Ohhh!

23:45.997 --> 23:48.670
