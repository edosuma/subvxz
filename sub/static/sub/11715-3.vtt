WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:05.714
Wow, Audrey.
So you have to have
a procedure?

00:05.756 --> 00:07.633
Is it...
Is it serious?

00:07.675 --> 00:08.509
No, she's just having
a node removed.

00:08.550 --> 00:11.804
It's no big deal.

00:11.846 --> 00:14.014
No big deal?
I'm having surgery, Jef.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.309
I know. I'm just saying,
it's gonna be fine.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.520
A doctor is removing
a part of my body.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.647
My God,
you are insensitive.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.484
It's gonna be fine,
Audrey.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.610
Thank you, Jen.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.574
Wait a minute,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

00:32.616 --> 00:33.408
Isn't that... Isn't that
what Jeff was just...

00:33.450 --> 00:34.451
Oh, it's not worth it.

00:36.578 --> 00:37.913
Marriage, it's not a wo,
it's a sentence.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.039
Am I right, fellas?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.210
God, it's still so weird
that Russell's married.

00:43.251 --> 00:45.004
Yeah. It's like seeing
a horse wearing a top h.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.256
Need a refill?

00:48.298 --> 00:50.175
Oh, yeah, thanks.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.135
Can I get you
anything else?
Uh, I think I'm good.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.762
(WAITRESS GIGGLES)
Ooh, actually,
I could use...

00:53.804 --> 00:57.307
Sorry, not my section.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.226
You see that,
everybody?

00:59.267 --> 01:00.728
She gives him coffee
and ignores me.

01:02.604 --> 01:03.605
It worked out this time,
'cause I looked down
her shirt,

01:03.647 --> 01:04.523
but still.

01:06.817 --> 01:08.318
Yeah, well, life's prety
for Mr. Handsome here.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.028
Exactly.

01:10.487 --> 01:13.741
Hey, well, maybe I'm inr
section and Russell isn.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.492
You're at the same tabl.

01:15.534 --> 01:18.495
You don't know
how they divvy it up.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.663
He's right.
Let me check.

01:19.705 --> 01:21.081
Uh, excuse me.

01:21.122 --> 01:21.874
Yes?

01:22.833 --> 01:24.585
Hey, uh,
is he in your section

01:24.626 --> 01:26.085
but the rest of the tabe
is not?

01:26.127 --> 01:27.671
That's kind of
a dumb question.

01:27.713 --> 01:28.839
Actually,
it's his theory.

01:28.881 --> 01:29.882
Oh. (LAUGHS)

01:31.550 --> 01:33.886
You're adorable.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.763
Let me get you
some free pie.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.265
Oh.
How... How 'bout
that?

01:40.017 --> 01:46.690
Hey, you guys should see
if they're giving away e
in your section.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.358
♪ How many ways to say
I love you?

01:52.237 --> 01:54.281
♪ How many ways to say
that I'm not scared?

01:56.533 --> 02:00.579
♪ With you by my side
there is no denying

02:01.622 --> 02:13.008
♪ I can't wait
for me and you ♪

02:13.050 --> 02:16.637
TIMMY: Sir...

02:16.678 --> 02:17.888
Your wife is
on the phone.

02:18.806 --> 02:19.640
(GROANS)

02:22.350 --> 02:23.852
Tell her I'm
in a meeting.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.270
Wait,
I don't want to lie.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.313
Set up a meeting.

02:26.939 --> 02:27.856
Fine.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.358
And can you go to
that meeting for me?

02:30.400 --> 02:34.738
Those things
are so pointless.

02:34.780 --> 02:35.864
Mrs. Dunbar,
hello again.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.617
Um, I can't seem
to locate him.

02:38.659 --> 02:42.496
Is there a message
I can give?

02:42.537 --> 02:46.166
You can't wait
to do what with him?

02:46.207 --> 02:47.584
(SIGHS)
This seems wildly perso.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.045
Do I really have to...
Okay, go on.

02:52.171 --> 02:52.840
(GROANS)

02:53.757 --> 02:56.301
Uh-huh.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.469
Uh, sorry, wait.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.680
Was that
"beside" or "inside"?

03:02.099 --> 03:03.182
"Inside," of course.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.021
And as the vomit
gushes upward,

03:08.105 --> 03:12.818
I bid you adieu.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.070
Sir, if my duties have
expanded to include
this type of thing,

03:16.363 --> 03:18.448
I'm going to insist
on your giving me a rai.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.741
Does this say "glow"?

03:19.783 --> 03:25.789
That's a "B."
Now...

03:25.831 --> 03:26.874
It's been three years.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.460
All you need to do
is sign a piece of pape.

03:30.502 --> 03:31.920
All right,
I'll sign it,

03:31.962 --> 03:33.505
but first you have to do
something for me.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.132
The company's going through
a little reorg action

03:36.383 --> 03:37.718
and somebody
has to be fired.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.011
Me. Please say it's me.

03:41.429 --> 03:42.723
It's Lester in Accounti.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.474
I tell you what.

03:44.516 --> 03:45.934
You help me
break the news to Leste,

03:47.227 --> 03:49.437
and I'll give you
your little raise.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.398
And why can't you
just do it, sir?

03:51.439 --> 03:52.900
Ah, you know how
I hate to be the bad gu.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.986
I don't know that at al.

03:56.028 --> 03:58.113
Just the other day,
you pantsed Gil
at his retirement lunch.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.116
I did that dude a favor.

04:01.158 --> 04:09.249
His thank you speech
was bombing.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.043
Hey. Great news.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.503
Oh, did your throat thig
go well?

04:13.545 --> 04:14.588
That is great news.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.464
Well, it's good news.

04:17.674 --> 04:20.510
The great news is
are you ready for this?

04:20.552 --> 04:21.511
She can't talk.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.394
Not for a whole week.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.897
So bingo,
daddy wins the lottery.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.358
That's big.
Congratulations.

04:36.317 --> 04:39.362
Thanks, buddy.
I appreciate it.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.655
(HOARSELY)
You are such a jerk.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.531
(COUGHS)

04:42.741 --> 04:44.451
That's the best part.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.120
If she tries to talk,
it's really painful.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.331
Hey, I'm just
kidding around.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.168
I'm glad it went well.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.255
All I want is for you
to feel better, okay?

04:56.296 --> 04:57.714
That being said, I've bn
waiting for this day

04:57.756 --> 04:58.840
since our honeymoon.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.095
Hey, listen, if it's to,
say the word and I'll s.

05:03.137 --> 05:03.929
Great.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.935
Ah, well, there's
an age-appropriate snac.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.771
Why are you eating
a candy apple?

05:14.148 --> 05:17.525
Finally get to the bottm
of your Halloween bag?

05:17.567 --> 05:19.945
No. The lady at
the street fair gave it
to me.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.656
Gave it to you? Oh, I'mk
of you getting free stu.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.574
He gets
free drinks at bars.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.201
Well, that's for everyo,
right?

05:26.243 --> 05:27.953
Your first drink's free
from lady bartenders.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.163
Or the gay-man ones.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.793
No, it's just for you be
they think you're attra.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.378
Like the waitress
with the free pie.

05:37.420 --> 05:41.675
I could get that waitress en
if I didn't look like t.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.678
Actually, we're engaged,
so you can't "get her."

05:44.719 --> 05:45.637
Whatever.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.557
I'm just saying,
people are into me

05:49.599 --> 05:50.642
'cause of my personalit.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.476
(RUSSELL LAUGHS)

05:52.435 --> 05:54.479
Yeah,
and girls like Brad Pitt

05:54.521 --> 06:04.031
because he cares
about New Orleans.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.782
Lester in there?

06:05.824 --> 06:08.535
As you requested, sir.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.245
All right, this is gonne
tough firing him,
be we can do it.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.579
Okay, now you start,

06:13.123 --> 06:14.499
but when it comes time
to bring down the hamme,

06:14.541 --> 06:16.210
I take over.
You got it?

06:16.251 --> 06:17.502
Got it.

06:17.544 --> 06:30.140
(SIGHS) Okay.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.266
Hey, Timmy.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.269
Ah, Lester.
It's good to see you.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.063
Yeah. Any idea why
Mr. Dunbar called me in?

06:37.856 --> 06:38.899
Actually, yes.

06:42.361 --> 06:43.278
(GROANS)

06:44.279 --> 06:45.197
Do your job!

06:48.325 --> 06:49.159
(SIGHS)

06:51.786 --> 06:53.914
All right, then.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.750
Now, Lester,

06:58.877 --> 07:01.380
as you know,

07:01.420 --> 07:02.463
the economy
is in pretty rough shap.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.298
Oh, I know.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.344
That's why I'm so thankl
to have this job.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.428
Yes, but the fact is,

07:09.470 --> 07:11.390
uh, even Dunbar Industrs
is forced to reduce its.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.142
Oh, that sounds
like a great chance

07:15.227 --> 07:17.396
for me to assume
more responsibility.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.106
Uh, that actually
won't be necessary.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.316
Oh, I'm happy to do it.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.359
I won't even
take time off next week

07:22.401 --> 07:24.694
when my wife gives birt.

07:24.736 --> 07:25.820
You're having a baby?

07:25.862 --> 07:27.072
Well, babies. Twins.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.034
Oh, well, at least
you have your health.

07:32.744 --> 07:49.094
Actually...
You've got to be
kidding me.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.929
Hey, hon,
how was your day?

07:53.307 --> 07:54.933
Oh, that's right.
You can't talk. Darn it.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.229
'cause, uh, tonight
I was gonna sit down

08:00.730 --> 08:02.690
and have you tell me abt
your thoughts and feeli,

08:05.277 --> 08:06.320
all about your friends

08:07.404 --> 08:08.863
and the fascinating this
they said.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.534
Oh, well, I guess I'll t
have to drink beer

08:13.576 --> 08:14.661
and watch TV instead.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.249
"My dad called.
Call him back."

08:19.791 --> 08:22.461
Aw, come on.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.296
Your dad goes on forever
about stuff I could
care less about.

08:26.089 --> 08:32.137
I guess you're not adop.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.764
"You're a moron."

08:34.806 --> 08:38.352
Had that one pre-writte,
did we?

08:38.393 --> 08:39.102
Fine.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.191
Yeah, hey, Earl,
it's Jeff.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.984
Uh, Audrey's doing well.
She said you called.

08:46.026 --> 08:46.860
Oh, okay.

08:48.111 --> 08:48.862
Okay.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.198
I will. Thanks.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.494
Wow. That was the best
conversation we ever ha.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.080
Concise
and right to the point.

09:02.334 --> 09:11.926
Oh, your aunt died.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.428
So, what were you like
before you met Adam?

09:13.470 --> 09:14.513
Pretty easy or?

09:17.265 --> 09:19.017
You had to buy me
a few drinks or a drink.

09:21.602 --> 09:22.854
But here's a little sec.

09:22.896 --> 09:23.938
Women enjoy sex, too.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.235
That has not been
my experience.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.194
Hi, guys.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.366
What did you do
to yourself?

09:34.408 --> 09:36.576
I busted out
the Halloween makeup ki.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.953
I'm gonna prove a point.

09:38.995 --> 09:42.165
I don't know
what's going on here,
but this is gonna be gr.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.667
Everyone thinks the word
is nice to me
because of my looks.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.295
I'm gonna prove
you're all wrong.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.129
Yo, yo.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.008
Could I get a
vodka tonic?

09:52.050 --> 09:54.969
Sure thing.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.680
See, even looking like ,
people are gonna treat e
the same way.

09:57.722 --> 10:01.476
Tonight when we get hom,
I'm not.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.479
Thanks, sweet cheeks.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.147
Uh, sir,
that's $8.

10:07.524 --> 10:08.816
Oh, no,
this is my first one.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.738
Congratulations.
It's still $8.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.659
I didn't bring
my wallet.

10:18.701 --> 10:19.911
Just put it
on our tab.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.582
Now will you please
take the makeup off?

10:23.623 --> 10:26.501
Don't listen to her.
Keep going.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.961
Yeah, well,
I didn't get a chance

10:28.002 --> 10:30.088
to use my personality
on the bartender.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.257
ADAM: Yeah?
You'll see.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.760
My personality could get haf
the girls here into the.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.512
But again, you can't.
We're engaged.

10:39.514 --> 10:42.476
Would you stop obsessing
about that?

10:42.517 --> 10:44.436
Watch this.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.980
Hey, there.
Hey.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.982
Bet you don't need sugar
in that drink

10:49.023 --> 10:52.819
'cause you're sweet enough.

10:52.860 --> 10:53.945
Could you be any cheesi?

10:54.404 --> 10:55.029
(GROANS)

11:00.827 --> 11:02.912
I can't believe this.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.332
I can't believe
you're marrying him.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.167
Hi. My name's Jill.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.712
Oh, I'm sorry. There's
been a misunderstanding.

11:13.548 --> 11:26.811
You see, I'm actually
incredibly handsome.

11:26.853 --> 11:30.565
I'm so sorry
about Aunt Lucy.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.317
She was the really big ,
right?

11:37.738 --> 11:39.073
She always smelled
like Funyuns?

11:46.289 --> 11:48.041
She was a good egg.

11:48.082 --> 11:53.254
She also smelled like e.

11:53.296 --> 11:54.506
What are you writing?

11:54.548 --> 11:55.674

11:59.802 --> 12:03.390
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Things I remember
about Aunt Lucy.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.723
You found a way to talk.

12:08.186 --> 12:10.063
What medicine gave me,
technology has taken aw.

FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
I want to give a eulogy
at the funeral.

12:17.904 --> 12:18.737
How?

12:19.614 --> 12:20.739
(TYPING)

12:24.661 --> 12:28.331
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
My voice should be
better by then.

12:28.373 --> 12:29.999
If it isn't,
you can always have

12:37.882 --> 12:39.300
You really think this ve
is sexy?

12:40.635 --> 12:41.469
I do.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.726
I wonder
what she has
to say next.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.563

12:54.815 --> 12:56.901

You are so hot, Jeff.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.279
Let's have sex
and then cut up
all my credit cards.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.162
Hi, Timmy.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.540
Oh, hello, Mr. Rhodes.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.709
Hey, why don't cannibals
eat clowns?

13:16.421 --> 13:17.338
What now?

13:19.173 --> 13:22.594
Because they taste funn.

13:22.636 --> 13:23.511
(LAUGHS)

13:24.345 --> 13:25.888
Indeed.
Okay, all right.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.600
Um, what do you call a g
with no legs?

13:28.642 --> 13:29.850
I really am...
it doesn't matter
what you call him,

13:29.892 --> 13:34.439
because he ain't comin'.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.148
(LAUGHS)

13:36.023 --> 13:40.403
That's pretty funny, ri?

13:40.445 --> 13:42.697
Mr. Rhodes, to what do
I owe this rather
odd verbal assault?

13:44.949 --> 13:46.785
(SIGHS) Well, Timmy, you kn,
I've realized

13:46.825 --> 13:48.119
that I kind of skate by
on my looks,

13:49.370 --> 13:51.080
so I've decided to
let my personality emer.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.837
You really think
that's wise?

13:58.879 --> 13:59.922
Yes. I'm funny.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.802
And I'm also
a very good listener.

14:03.842 --> 14:07.681
People like that.
Go on.

14:07.722 --> 14:10.767
It's a little more compd
than that, don't you th?

14:10.809 --> 14:11.976
Sir?
Oh, I'm so sorry.

14:12.851 --> 14:17.440
I was thinking about bi.

14:17.482 --> 14:20.401
What I was trying to sas
that you can't just invt
a personality overnight.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.570
It's something that
takes shape over time.

14:22.612 --> 14:25.448
Like a nest.
Enough with the birds.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.493
All right. All right, T.
I'll just let you get bk
to work.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.745
Actually,
it's not work at all.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.331
I felt so badly about
firing poor Lester,

14:33.373 --> 14:37.210
I've taken it upon mysef
to find him another job.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.086
"Eco-friendly buildings
for low-income housing."

14:39.128 --> 14:41.798
Mmm-hmm.
Good salary,
solid benefits.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.923
Well, Lester should be
pretty happy.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.551
Mmm, I should think so.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.261
This job is actually
way better than, uh...

14:47.303 --> 14:48.179
Than mine.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.313
Tastefully decorated ro.

14:57.980 --> 14:58.857
Lovely flowers.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.611
Hey, it looks like
they squeezed her
into a regular-sized ca.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.120
Sir, a moment,
please.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.205
Timmy, can you come in here
for a second?

15:14.247 --> 15:14.873
I'm...

15:16.040 --> 15:18.459
Take a look
at this photo.

15:18.501 --> 15:21.838
Do you think this pictus
a fake?

15:21.880 --> 15:23.923
Oh, no, I'm sure
it's a genuine photograh

15:23.964 --> 15:27.594
of Pippa Middleton
and J. Lo going at it.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.096
Now, as you know, sir,
I let Lester go.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.975
I mean,
where would
they have met?

15:35.017 --> 15:36.394
Sir.
She lives in England.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.104
Sir, I held up
my end of the deal.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.108
Now it's your turn
to hold up yours.

15:42.149 --> 15:43.735
Oh, yeah, your raise.
What a buzz kill.

15:45.904 --> 15:46.905
I don't know, Tim.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.743
I mean, the economy's kind f
in a shambles right now.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.080
You are going to give me
a substantial raise,

15:56.122 --> 15:58.165
and if you don't,
I will leave
and take this job.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.090
"Eco-friendly housing"?
Snore.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.303
Sent them my resume,
had a meeting.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.056
The job's mine
if I want it.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.975
But look at
this crappy salary.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.393
It's 20% more
than I make here.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.650
But can you really put a pre
on working with friends?

16:23.691 --> 16:25.192
Hmm.
I detest you.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.030
And in addition
to matching their offer,

16:31.699 --> 16:33.576
you will also start
treating me like
a human being.

16:33.618 --> 16:34.619
Oh...

16:37.413 --> 16:38.122
Wowee.

16:38.957 --> 16:39.958
Well, that's asking a l.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.010
Oh, man, at least Lucy
gets to lie down.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.932
Do you still think
you can speak?

17:37.974 --> 17:39.058
How's your voice?

17:39.099 --> 17:40.518
(HOARSELY) Better.

Aud, you can't do this.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.522

It is important to me.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.817
And the next speaker will be
Lucy's beloved niece Audrey.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.738
Hey, I'll tell you what.

17:51.779 --> 18:07.086
We'll go up there together d
I'll read your speech for y.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.462
This just says,
"You're a moron."

18:16.888 --> 18:21.141
(WHISPERING) You left
your speech at home?

18:21.183 --> 18:22.393
Don't worry.
I've got this.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.730
Hey, Jeff Bingham here.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.192
I'm speaking for
my dumb wife Audrey.

18:31.402 --> 18:33.237
Dumb in that she can't spea,
not stupid.

18:35.364 --> 18:38.034
She's actually really s,

18:38.076 --> 18:41.621
which often comes back
to bite me in the ass.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.289
Anyway, yeah, Aunt Lucy.
She's right in there.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.419
Well, where does
where does one start?

18:48.461 --> 18:49.587
Uh, she loved Funyuns.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.132
Eggs.
(HOARSELY)
That's enough.

18:56.719 --> 18:57.887
I want to do this.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.601
I want to tell you someg
about Aunt Lucy

19:03.643 --> 19:06.437
that even Audrey doesn't kn.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.355
When Audrey and I
were first dating,

19:08.397 --> 19:09.857
uh, I came out here
to meet her family,

19:11.109 --> 19:12.860
and it was
pretty intimidating.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.904
I was feeling
a lot of pressure.

19:14.946 --> 19:17.073
And one night Aunt Lucy
came up to me

19:17.115 --> 19:19.408
and she said, "Jeff,
Audrey is a strong woman

19:20.660 --> 19:23.412
"because she comes from
this strong family,

19:23.454 --> 19:25.665
"but as long as you love he,
we will all love you."

19:27.959 --> 19:32.379
She was right, and for ,
I will always remember .

19:36.968 --> 19:37.969
That was me!

19:40.554 --> 19:42.306
I told you that, not Lu.

19:47.436 --> 19:57.864
Just know I've got thaty
in the hopper for you
when you go.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.032
Hey, sunshine.

19:59.073 --> 20:00.658
Hey. How was work?

20:01.241 --> 20:03.119
Oh, the usual.

20:03.161 --> 20:04.453
And it sounds like your voie
is back to normal.

20:04.495 --> 20:05.872
Yeah, I think it is.

20:05.913 --> 20:14.005
Well, all good things,
right?

20:14.047 --> 20:15.631
Where's the remote?

20:15.673 --> 20:16.716
I hid it.
(CLEARS THROAT)

20:19.301 --> 20:20.136
Why?

20:22.138 --> 20:24.264
I thought I'd take you p
on your earlier offer

20:24.306 --> 20:26.809
to talk about work,
my friends, my feelings.

20:30.813 --> 20:31.731
I'm sorry.

20:34.608 --> 20:35.902
It was
a onetime-only offer.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.573
Hmm, I'm starting to fot
where I hid that remote.

20:41.615 --> 20:42.616
Well played.

20:44.660 --> 20:45.828
So...
(CLEARS THROAT)

20:47.538 --> 20:50.041
Work was good.
I was in the copy room today
and I ran into Wendy.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.000
You remember Wendy?

20:52.626 --> 20:55.254
I told you about her
and her husband Phil's p
to Yosemite?

20:55.295 --> 20:58.549
Well, it seems that
Phil suggested Wendy
lose a few pounds.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.801
She was crying.

21:01.844 --> 21:03.971
I mean, Phil himself is
no prize,

21:04.013 --> 21:06.015
but I was not gonna
bring that up.
