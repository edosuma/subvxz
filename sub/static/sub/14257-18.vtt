01:10.052 --> 01:11.555
I'M SO HUNGRY,

01:11.556 --> 01:13.394
I COULD EVEN EAT
THAT PICKLED TOFU.

01:13.395 --> 01:17.072
WE BETTER SEE
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG
HEATING THOSE PIZZAS.

01:18.344 --> 01:19.847
UH-OH.

01:19.848 --> 01:21.820
THE OVEN'S EMPTY!

01:21.821 --> 01:24.294
OUR PIZZAS ARE GONE!

01:25.365 --> 01:27.403
HMM. I'VE GOT A THEORY.

01:30.246 --> 01:31.315
YO, DUDES.

01:31.316 --> 01:33.488
HUH,
WHAT'S THE HAPS?

01:33.489 --> 01:36.498
THE HAPS IS YOU ATE
ALL OF OUR PIZZAS.

01:36.499 --> 01:38.269
<i>WHO, MOI?</i>

01:38.270 --> 01:41.914
MASTER, MICHELANGELO
ATE ALL OUR PIZZAS AGAIN.

01:41.915 --> 01:43.419
YOU WERE WARNED,
MICHELANGELO.

01:43.420 --> 01:46.361
I SHALL HAVE TO
APPLY KUNG PAO.

01:46.362 --> 01:48.434
KUNG PAO?

01:49.939 --> 01:52.914
KUNG PAO IS AN ANCIENT FORM
OF MIND CONTROL.

01:52.915 --> 01:55.956
I ASSURE YOU
IT WILL NOT HURT.

01:55.957 --> 01:57.527
REPEAT AFTER ME.

01:57.528 --> 02:00.503
I CRAVE PIZZA NO MORE.

02:00.504 --> 02:03.980
I CRAVE PIZZA NO MORE.

02:03.981 --> 02:06.554
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS.

02:06.555 --> 02:10.066
I HAVE A FEELING
THIS WILL NOT BE EASY.

02:13.008 --> 02:15.816
WELL, SHREDDER,

02:15.817 --> 02:17.488
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN MANAGE

02:17.489 --> 02:21.467
TO OBLITERATE
THE TURTLES THIS TIME?

02:21.468 --> 02:22.804
IT'S EASY
TO CRITICIZE,

02:22.805 --> 02:25.211
BUT I'M THE ONE
WHO'S DOING
ALL THE WORK.

02:25.212 --> 02:27.017
DO YOU HAVE THE DISKS?

02:27.018 --> 02:28.655
RIGHT HERE.

02:28.656 --> 02:30.126
SOON, WITH THESE,

02:30.127 --> 02:32.667
WE'LL BE USING
THE SHELLS
OF THOSE TURTLES

02:32.668 --> 02:34.272
AS HUBCAPS!

02:42.498 --> 02:45.740
WHAT DOES SHREDDER
THINK WE ARE, ANYWAY?
A COUPLE OF HOUSEMAIDS?

02:45.741 --> 02:46.743
[EXPLOSION]

02:46.744 --> 02:49.049
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:55.604 --> 02:58.244
OH, HI, BOSS.

02:59.950 --> 03:01.788
THIS PLACE IS A PIGSTY!

03:01.789 --> 03:03.494
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO CLEAN UP?

03:03.495 --> 03:07.706
WE DID, BUT THEN YOU
CAME BUSTING IN AND WE--

03:07.707 --> 03:09.077
NO EXCUSES.

03:09.078 --> 03:11.217
GET TO YOUR POSITIONS.

03:11.218 --> 03:14.226
WE MUST ACTIVATE
THE HOLOGRAPHIC SYNTHESIZER.

03:14.227 --> 03:16.065
SURE THING, BOSS.

03:19.008 --> 03:20.746
POWER ON.

03:23.421 --> 03:27.867
IT LOOKS
JUST LIKE CHRISTMASTIME
AT THE STATE PEN.

03:27.868 --> 03:28.870
QUIET!

03:28.871 --> 03:30.743
INSERT THIS
GRAPHICS DISK.

03:32.816 --> 03:35.423
"SUBJECT--
MI--MI--

03:35.424 --> 03:38.032
MICHELANGELO."

03:38.033 --> 03:41.374
THAT DISK CONTAINS ALL
THE PHYSICAL DATA WE NEED

03:41.375 --> 03:43.481
TO CREATE
A DIMENSIONAL HOLOGRAM.

03:43.482 --> 03:46.490
IT'S THAT SURFER TURTLE.

03:46.491 --> 03:50.536
BLAH, LET'S TURN HIM
INTO TURTLE MUSH.

03:52.241 --> 03:56.387
CRETINS!
DIDN'T I JUST SAY
IT'S A HOLOGRAM?

03:56.388 --> 03:58.693
YEAH.
UH, WHAT'S A HOLOGRAM?

03:58.694 --> 04:01.870
IT'S AN EXACT LIKENESS
OF MICHELANGELO

04:01.871 --> 04:04.879
THAT I WILL PROGRAM
TO INFILTRATE
THE TURTLE'S LAIR

04:04.880 --> 04:06.217
AND DESTROY THEM!

04:06.218 --> 04:08.523
IT WILL TALK,
ACT, AND THINK

04:08.524 --> 04:10.897
JUST LIKE THE REAL
MICHELANGELO.

04:10.898 --> 04:12.903
NOW REMOVE
THE GRAPHICS DISK.

04:12.904 --> 04:14.408
OK, OK.

04:14.409 --> 04:17.750
DON'T GET YOUR RAZORS
ALL RUFFLED.

04:17.752 --> 04:19.490
NOW...

04:19.491 --> 04:20.995
THIS DISK CONTAINS

04:20.995 --> 04:23.502
EVERYTHING WE KNOW
ABOUT MICHELANGELO,

04:23.503 --> 04:26.343
EVEN HIS ENDLESS APPETITE
FOR PIZZA.

04:26.344 --> 04:28.952
INSERT IT GENTLY.

04:28.953 --> 04:30.356
PSST.

04:30.357 --> 04:33.599
YOU'RE PUTTING IT IN
BACKWARDS.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.104
BIG DEAL.

04:35.105 --> 04:37.076
SO WHAT COULD HAPPEN?

04:37.077 --> 04:39.752
[BEEPING]

04:41.992 --> 04:43.128
WHOA!

04:45.269 --> 04:48.611
I...I FEEL SO STRANGE.

04:48.612 --> 04:52.389
HEY, WHERE'S
THE BOSS GOING?

04:52.390 --> 04:54.630
ONCE MORE,
MICHELANGELO.

04:54.631 --> 04:57.204
I CRAVE PIZZA
NO MORE.

04:57.205 --> 05:00.982
I CRAVE PIZZA NO MORE.

05:00.983 --> 05:02.319
EXCELLENT.

05:02.320 --> 05:03.422
NOW AWAKEN.

05:03.423 --> 05:06.231

THE ACID TEST.

05:06.232 --> 05:07.669

05:07.670 --> 05:11.246

A PIZZA WITH THE WORKS?

05:11.247 --> 05:14.021
PIZZA?
NO WAY, DUDE.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.130
I CRAVE PIZZA
NO MORE.

05:17.131 --> 05:18.435
AMAZING.

05:18.436 --> 05:19.471
ASTONISHING.

05:19.472 --> 05:20.742
NOT BAD.

05:20.743 --> 05:23.450
MAYBE NOW IT'S SAFE
TO ORDER OUT
FOR SOME PIZZAS.

05:23.451 --> 05:24.954
NO NEED, DUDES.

05:24.955 --> 05:27.462
I BROUGHT BACK
SOME TAKEOUT.

05:27.463 --> 05:29.268
SO, LIKE, LET'S
GET DOWN AND PIG OUT.

05:29.269 --> 05:30.906
IT'S SHREDDER.

05:30.907 --> 05:31.909
WHERE? WHERE?

05:34.652 --> 05:37.660
YO! LET'S SCARF
SOME PIZZAS, COMPADRES.

05:37.661 --> 05:40.769
JUST WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING,
TIN GRIN?

05:40.770 --> 05:42.541
MELLOW OUT, DUDE.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.212
THIS IS MY PAD.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.985
I LIVE HERE.

05:45.986 --> 05:47.723
WELL, NOT
FOR LONG.

05:47.724 --> 05:48.961
MICHELANGELO.

05:48.962 --> 05:51.233
<i>YES, SENSEI?
YES, SENSEI?</i>

05:51.234 --> 05:52.338
KNEEL DOWN, PLEASE.

05:54.478 --> 05:57.051
WHO ARE YOU, HOW DID
YOU FIND THIS PLACE,

05:57.052 --> 05:58.489
AND WHAT IS
YOUR MISSION?

05:58.490 --> 05:59.994
I AM MICHELANGELO.

05:59.995 --> 06:02.000
THIS IS MY HOME.

06:02.001 --> 06:05.577
MY MISSION IS TO SERVE
THE COOL FORCES OF GOOD,

06:05.578 --> 06:08.954
TO OBEY MY TOTALLY HIP
MASTER SPLINTER,

06:08.955 --> 06:10.760
AND, WHENEVER POSSIBLE,

06:10.761 --> 06:14.137
TO CONSUME
MONDO PORTIONS OF PIZZA.

06:14.138 --> 06:15.975
HE'S REALLY IN TROUBLE.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.479
HE THINKS HE'S
MICHELANGELO.

06:17.480 --> 06:21.358
AS MICHELANGELO, HE
SEEMS TO KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT SHREDDER.

06:21.359 --> 06:23.799
I MUST SPEAK
TO SHREDDER HIMSELF.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.273
WHEN YOU HEAR
THE NAME SHREDDER,

06:26.274 --> 06:28.981
YOU WILL BECOME
YOUR FORMER
INSIDIOUS SELF.

06:28.982 --> 06:32.459
SHREDDER.
SHREDDER. SHREDDER.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.331
SHREDDER.

06:34.332 --> 06:37.239
SPLINTER, MY SWORN ENEMY!

06:38.478 --> 06:40.884
HOW DID I GET HERE?
LET ME GO!

06:40.885 --> 06:43.391
I'LL SHELL YOU
LIKE WALNUTS.

06:43.392 --> 06:46.400
YUP, HE'S HIS FORMER
INSIDIOUS SELF,
ALL RIGHT.

06:46.401 --> 06:48.240
YOU STUPID TURTLES

06:48.241 --> 06:50.179
WON'T GET ANYTHING
OUT OF ME.

06:50.180 --> 06:51.482
I'LL NEVER TALK!

06:51.483 --> 06:54.826
IT'S NO USE. I HAVE
TO CHANGE HIM BACK.

06:54.827 --> 06:57.400
WHEN I SAY THE NAME
MICHELANGELO,

06:57.401 --> 06:59.807
YOU WILL BECOME HIM
ONCE AGAIN.

06:59.808 --> 07:01.647
MICHELANGELO.
MICHELANGELO.

07:01.648 --> 07:03.185
MICHELANGELO.

07:03.186 --> 07:06.595
YOU'LL NEVER SPEAK
THE NAME OF MY ARCH ENEMY.

07:06.596 --> 07:10.607
INSTEAD, YOU WILL REFER
TO HIM AS YOU-KNOW-WHO.

07:10.608 --> 07:12.680
AND THAT GOES
FOR ALL OF YOU.

07:12.681 --> 07:15.187
ONE MENTION OF
YOU-KNOW-WHO'S NAME

07:15.188 --> 07:17.494
WILL CHANGE HIM BACK
TO HIS FORMER SELF.

07:17.495 --> 07:20.270
AND THAT WOULD BE
DISASTROUS.

07:20.271 --> 07:23.011
HOW LONG DO WE
HAVE TO PUT UP WITH
CANHEAD LIKE THIS?

07:23.012 --> 07:26.355
UNTIL WE DISCOVER
WHAT HIS PLAN IS.

07:26.356 --> 07:28.729
IT'S GETTING
TOO CROWDED IN HERE.

07:28.730 --> 07:31.470
I'M GOING FOR A SPIN
AROUND THE SEWERS.

07:31.471 --> 07:35.783
OH, WOW!
MONDO NOTION, MAN.
INCLUDE ME IN, OK?

07:35.784 --> 07:39.294
JUST WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING, DUDE?

07:39.295 --> 07:40.798
SEWER SURFING, MAN.

07:40.799 --> 07:42.804
I HUNGER

07:42.805 --> 07:45.780
WELL, NOT ON
MY CHEAP SKATE, YOU DON'T.

07:45.781 --> 07:49.893
YOUR CHEAP SKATE?
IT'S MY CHEAP SKATE!

07:49.894 --> 07:52.299
THIS SEWER'S
NOT BIG ENOUGH

07:52.300 --> 07:53.302
FOR THE TWO OF US.

07:53.303 --> 07:54.773
I'M OUT OF HERE!

07:57.248 --> 07:58.786
MASTER, SHR--
YOU-KNOW-WHO

07:58.787 --> 08:01.294
SEEMS TO HAVE
DROPPED THIS.

08:01.295 --> 08:03.433
IT'S A GRAPHICS DISK.

08:03.434 --> 08:08.013
HMM. THIS MAY
BE THE CLUE WE'VE
BEEN SEARCHING FOR.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.400
GUESS I'LL
JUST DROWN MY SORROWS

08:14.401 --> 08:18.880
HERE AT VINNIE'S
WITH A PIZZA.

08:18.881 --> 08:20.384
THE WEIRD THING

08:20.385 --> 08:24.396
IS I CRAVE PIZZA
NO MORE.

08:25.835 --> 08:27.473
WOW! A TURTLE.

08:27.474 --> 08:31.485
THIS IS EVEN BETTER
THAN FINDING THE BOSS.

08:31.486 --> 08:32.520
YEAH!

08:32.522 --> 08:34.427
I'M IN THE MOOD

08:34.428 --> 08:38.539
FOR SOME SERIOUS
TURTLE BASHING.

08:39.878 --> 08:42.284
IT'S A GOOD THING
APRIL IS WORKING LATE.

08:42.284 --> 08:44.022
YEAH. WE COULD USE
HER COMPUTER EQUIPMENT

08:44.023 --> 08:45.560
TO READ THIS DISK

08:45.561 --> 08:48.837
THAT WAY WE CAN FIGURE OUT
YOU-KNOW-WHO'S PLAN.

08:51.714 --> 08:53.619
PSST. YO, APRIL.

08:53.620 --> 08:56.560
TURTLES, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

08:56.561 --> 08:59.637
HEY, BABE!
WHAT'S GOING DOWN
IN THIS HERE TOWN?

08:59.638 --> 09:03.014
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
THAT'S SHRED--

09:03.015 --> 09:06.056
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T SAY HIS NAME.

09:06.057 --> 09:07.527
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

09:07.528 --> 09:09.667
WE'VE GOT TO ACCESS
YOUR COMPUTER.

09:09.668 --> 09:10.670
WHAT'S ON THE DISK?

09:10.671 --> 09:12.509
WE'RE ABOUT
TO FIND OUT.

09:17.123 --> 09:19.296
OH, WOW, DUDES.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.901
IT'S ME!

09:20.902 --> 09:22.907
WHAT THE HECK
IS IT, DONATELLO?

09:22.908 --> 09:25.681
IT LOOKS LIKE
SOME SORT OF
HOLOGRAM PROGRAM.

09:25.682 --> 09:27.554
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:29.159 --> 09:31.667
THE PROGRAM OVERLOADED
THE CIRCUITS.

09:31.668 --> 09:35.411
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU-KNOW-WHO
PLANS TO CLONE MICHELANGELO.

09:35.412 --> 09:37.049
OH, YEAH?

09:37.050 --> 09:39.724
IF METAL-MOUTH
TRIES ANYTHING ON ME,

09:39.725 --> 09:41.229
HYAH!

09:41.230 --> 09:43.068
IF YOU WERE
MICHELANGELO,

09:43.069 --> 09:44.706
AND YOU ARE,

09:44.707 --> 09:46.344
WHERE WOULD YOU
GO TO SULK?

09:46.345 --> 09:50.222
LIKE, WHERE ELSE, DUDE?
VINNIE'S PIZZA.

09:50.223 --> 09:53.633
TIME TO CRACK
SOME SHELLS.

09:53.634 --> 09:56.140
LOOK, PAL, THIS AIN'T
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.

09:56.141 --> 09:57.812
YOU GONNA READ
OR ARE YOU GONNA
ORDER PIZZA?

09:57.813 --> 10:02.092
I DON'T KNOW, DUDE.
FOR SOME BIZARRO REASON,

10:02.093 --> 10:04.098
I CAN'T
MAKE UP MY MIND.

10:04.099 --> 10:06.204
GEEZ, YOU'RE SLOWER
THAN A TURTLE.

10:06.205 --> 10:07.743
HOW ABOUT THE WORKS?

10:07.744 --> 10:09.682
THE WORKS?
RIGHTEOUS.

10:09.683 --> 10:10.918
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT I W--

10:10.919 --> 10:14.697
<i>I CRAVE PIZZA NO MORE.</i>

10:14.698 --> 10:16.201
UH, SCRATCH
THAT NOTION, DUDE.

10:16.202 --> 10:18.709
I CRAVE PIZZA NO MORE.

10:18.710 --> 10:20.615
JUST GIVE ME
A SOFT DRINK.

10:20.616 --> 10:24.492
YEAH, WHY NOT?
IT GOES PERFECT
WITH YOUR SOFT HEAD.

10:24.494 --> 10:26.431
OH, WHAT A PITY.

10:26.432 --> 10:30.645
HE WON'T EVEN
GET TO ENJOY
HIS LAST PIZZA.

10:32.885 --> 10:34.690
AAH!
AAH!

10:34.691 --> 10:36.261
WHERE'D HE GO?

10:36.262 --> 10:37.699
I CAN'T SEE!

10:37.700 --> 10:39.037

10:39.038 --> 10:40.408
JUST KEEP FIRING.

10:41.813 --> 10:42.882
HEY.

10:43.886 --> 10:45.389
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:45.390 --> 10:46.392
OHH!

10:46.393 --> 10:50.471
I'LL FIND YOU
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

10:50.472 --> 10:52.109
DUE NORTH, DUDE.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.882
BUMMER.

10:53.883 --> 10:57.927
GOTCHA NOW, SHELLBACK.

10:57.928 --> 11:00.903
LOOKS LIKE
WE GOT OURSELVES
A CANNED TURTLE.

11:09.329 --> 11:10.832
WELL, ALL RIGHT!

11:10.833 --> 11:13.173
CHOWTIME!

11:13.174 --> 11:14.778
I HOPE MICHELANGELO'S

11:14.779 --> 11:17.955
I HOPE HE'S
IN ONE PIECE.

11:17.956 --> 11:19.024
MICHELANGELO.

11:19.025 --> 11:21.030

11:27.785 --> 11:30.359
FOR SURE.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.866
I'M IN MONDO DANGER,
RIGHT?

11:32.867 --> 11:33.869
RIGHT.

11:33.870 --> 11:35.173
NOW LET'S
KEEP LOOKING.

11:38.618 --> 11:41.458
OH, WOW.
TRULY AWESOME.

11:41.459 --> 11:44.067
OH, TUBULOSO.

11:44.068 --> 11:47.309
THERE'S SOME CHEESE
LEFT IN THIS SHREDDER.

11:47.310 --> 11:48.514
<i>SHREDDER?</i>

11:48.515 --> 11:49.517
<i>SHREDDER.</i>

11:49.518 --> 11:51.021
<i>SHREDDER.</i>

11:51.022 --> 11:53.027
OH. WHERE AM I?

11:53.028 --> 11:55.100
HOW DID I GET HERE?

11:55.101 --> 11:57.006
TURTLES.

11:57.007 --> 11:59.279
THEY MUST'VE GRABBED
MICHELANGELO.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.790
NOW I'LL BET THEY PLAN
ON INFILTRATING US
WITH HIS HOLOGRAM.

12:02.791 --> 12:04.295
LET'S HEAD BACK
TO CHANNEL 6

12:04.296 --> 12:06.501
AND SEE
IF DONATELLO
FOUND ANYTHING.

12:06.502 --> 12:08.507
FORGET IT! YOU'RE
NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

12:08.508 --> 12:09.845
AAH!

12:14.660 --> 12:16.231
HAVE THE WORKS,
TURTLES.

12:16.232 --> 12:17.400
IT'S ON ME.

12:17.401 --> 12:19.908
OR BETTER YET,
IT'S ON YOU.

12:22.015 --> 12:24.656
¶ WE GOT US A TURTLE ¶

12:24.657 --> 12:26.394
¶ WE GOT US A TURTLE ¶

12:26.395 --> 12:28.902
PUT A SOCK IN IT,
WILL YA?

12:28.903 --> 12:31.409
YOU'RE GIVING ME
A MONDO MIGRAINE.

12:31.410 --> 12:33.918
<i>YOU PUT A SOCK IN IT.</i>

12:33.919 --> 12:35.789
[BOTH LAUGHING]

12:35.790 --> 12:37.728
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

12:37.729 --> 12:39.467
LOOK, BOSS,

12:39.468 --> 12:41.407
¶ WE GOT US
A TURTLE ¶

12:41.408 --> 12:43.111
SO, YOU SIMPLETONS

12:43.112 --> 12:45.920
FINALLY MANAGED
TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT.

12:45.921 --> 12:49.129
SHREDDER, ARE YOU THERE?

12:49.130 --> 12:51.838
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN,
SHREDDER?

12:51.839 --> 12:53.844
I--I'M NOT SURE.

12:53.845 --> 12:56.953
I MUST'VE BEEN HIJACKED
BY THE TURTLES.

12:56.954 --> 13:00.832
WELL, YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO HIJACK THEM!

13:00.833 --> 13:02.771
I GOT ONE OF THEM,
DIDN'T I?

13:02.772 --> 13:04.175
I'M WORKING ON IT.

13:04.176 --> 13:06.015
OH, GOOD.

13:06.016 --> 13:09.024
ONCE PHASE ONE
IS ACCOMPLISHED,

13:09.025 --> 13:13.904
WE'LL PROCEED TO
FINE-TUNE THE MASTER PLAN.

13:13.905 --> 13:15.410
SHREDDER'S
HOLOGRAPHIC SYNTHESIZER

13:15.411 --> 13:18.385
MAY BE MORE POWERFUL
THAN WE IMAGINED,

13:18.386 --> 13:21.160
BUT MAYBE
THIS WILL MATCH IT.

13:21.161 --> 13:22.832
NOW, LET'S TRY
TO READ THAT DISK.

13:27.447 --> 13:30.053
"PHASE TWO--
THE MASTER PLAN"?

13:30.054 --> 13:31.826
WHAT'S IT DOING?

13:31.827 --> 13:34.099
WE BOOTED UP
ANOTHER FILE.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.573
IT'S ANOTHER HOLOGRAM.

13:36.574 --> 13:39.482
[GASPS]
IT'S THE PRESIDENT!

13:39.483 --> 13:42.491
I BETTER CONTACT
LEONARDO AND RAPHAEL
RIGHT AWAY.

13:42.492 --> 13:45.968
<i>LEONARDO! RAPHAEL!
DO YOU READ ME?</i>

13:47.674 --> 13:51.351
<i>LEONARDO! RAPHAEL!
COME IN!</i>

13:54.327 --> 13:57.135
LEONARDO! RAPHAEL!

13:57.136 --> 13:58.640
THERE'S NO ANSWER.

13:58.641 --> 14:00.278
THEY MUST BE IN TROUBLE.

14:02.151 --> 14:04.758
<i>OH, YIPPIE!</i>

14:04.759 --> 14:07.768
<i>ONCE OUR PRESIDENTIAL
HOLOGRAM</i>

14:07.769 --> 14:11.044
<i>IS OFFICIALLY
INAUGURATED,</i>

14:11.045 --> 14:13.284
<i>I WILL CONTROL</i>

14:13.285 --> 14:17.530
<i>THE MOST POWERFUL OFFICE
IN THE WORLD.</i>

14:17.531 --> 14:20.071
<i>YOU MEAN WE,
DON'T YOU?</i>

14:20.072 --> 14:22.579
<i>YOU CAN BE
VICE PRESIDENT.</i>

14:22.580 --> 14:26.090
HMM. JUST A HEARTBEAT
AWAY. NOT BAD.

14:26.091 --> 14:28.196
ROCK STEADY, BEBOP,

14:28.197 --> 14:30.269
POWER UP THE SYNTHESIZER.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.910
SURE THING,
MR. VICE PRESIDENT.

14:36.957 --> 14:39.564
NOW, INSERT
THE GRAPHICS DISK,

14:39.565 --> 14:41.703
AND THIS TIME, DO IT RIGHT.

14:41.704 --> 14:45.381
UH...ME, BOSS?
BUT YOU GOT THE DISK.

14:45.382 --> 14:47.721
IT'S GONE!

14:47.722 --> 14:49.393
<i>WHAT?</i>

14:49.394 --> 14:53.372
<i>I KNEW I NEVER SHOULD
HAVE TRUSTED YOU.</i>

14:53.373 --> 14:55.445
BLAST IT!

14:55.446 --> 14:57.284
THOSE TURTLES
MUST HAVE IT!

14:57.285 --> 15:00.126
IT SURE IS
HOT IN HERE.

15:00.127 --> 15:02.466
NO WONDER!

15:02.467 --> 15:05.475
WE'RE ABOUT TO BECOME
TODAY'S HOT PLATE SPECIAL.

15:05.476 --> 15:08.117
WHAT A WAY TO GO.

15:08.118 --> 15:11.259
WE'LL PROBABLY GET
EATEN BY SHREDDER.

15:11.260 --> 15:14.268
OR, WORSE YET,
MICHELANGELO.

15:16.643 --> 15:19.718
WHEW! TALK ABOUT CLOSE.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.390
HEY, IS THAT YOU,
DONATELLO?

15:21.391 --> 15:25.402
GUESS AGAIN.
NOW HAND OVER
THAT GRAPHICS DISK.

15:25.403 --> 15:28.243
SURE THING,
MICHELANGELO...

15:28.244 --> 15:31.420
MICHELANGELO...
MICHELANGELO...

15:31.421 --> 15:35.332
OH, WOW! HEY, DUDES.
HOW'D YOU GET
IN THIS FIX?

15:35.333 --> 15:37.505
OR, SHOULD I SAY,
FIXINGS?

15:37.506 --> 15:40.615
IT'S A LONG
STORY. JUST HELP
US OUT OF HERE.

15:40.616 --> 15:42.988
OH, WITH MUCHO GUSTO,
AMIGOS.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.697
ARE YOU GUYS OK?

15:45.698 --> 15:47.870
WE'RE FINE.
WHO DOESN'T ENJOY

15:47.871 --> 15:50.545
BEING WRAPPED IN
MELTED MOZZARELLA?

15:50.546 --> 15:52.083
WELL, COME WITH ME.

15:52.084 --> 15:55.693
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO SHOW YOU.

15:55.694 --> 15:57.533
SO, THEY PLAN ON
REPLACING THE PRESIDENT

15:57.534 --> 15:59.304
WITH A HOLOGRAM, TOO?

15:59.305 --> 16:01.310
THIS DISK IS JUST
A BLUEPRINT.

16:01.311 --> 16:02.581
THEY MUST HAVE

16:02.582 --> 16:05.222
AN ADVANCED HOLOGRAPHIC
SYNTHESIZER SOMEWHERE.

16:05.223 --> 16:07.663
THEN WE'VE
GOT TO FIND IT
AND DESTROY IT.

16:07.664 --> 16:10.338
WE'VE GOT TO FIND
POOR MICHELANGELO, TOO.

16:10.339 --> 16:13.581
DON'T BE A DUFUS, BABE.
I'M RIGHT HERE.

16:13.582 --> 16:15.420
THERE'S ONE PERSON
WHO CAN TELL US

16:15.421 --> 16:18.195
WHERE BOTH THE DISK
AND OUR BUDDY ARE.

16:19.499 --> 16:20.903
WHAT ARE YOU DUDES
STARING AT?

16:20.904 --> 16:22.909
IS MY HEADBAND
ON BACKWARDS?

16:22.910 --> 16:26.086
DONATELLO, CAN YOU
REPROGRAM THAT DISK?

16:26.087 --> 16:28.860
DO TURTLES
HAVE SHELLS?

16:31.369 --> 16:33.040
HEY, HEY, HOLD
THE ANCHOVIES, HUH?

16:33.041 --> 16:34.878
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO BREAK OUT
OF THIS STUFF.

16:34.879 --> 16:37.787
EVERYTHING'S GOT
TO LOOK EXACTLY
AS IT DID BEFORE

16:37.788 --> 16:41.732
SO YOU-KNOW-WHO WON'T
SUSPECT ANY TIME
HAS PASSED.

16:41.733 --> 16:43.940
DONATELLO,
YOU STAKE OUT THE FRONT.

16:43.941 --> 16:45.477
CHECK!

16:45.478 --> 16:48.788
MICHELANGELO, YOU PULL
OUT THE LASER GUN
AND HOLD IT ON US.

16:48.789 --> 16:51.729
I STILL THINK YOU DUDES
HAVE GONE NUTZOID.

16:51.730 --> 16:55.006
WE'RE JUST SETTING
UP A LITTLE STING
OPERATION FOR...

16:55.007 --> 16:56.009
SHREDDER.

16:56.010 --> 16:57.881
SHREDDER.

16:57.882 --> 16:59.186
SHREDDER.

16:59.187 --> 17:00.189
SHREDDER.

17:00.190 --> 17:02.763
YOU HEARD ME!
I WANT THAT DISK!

17:02.764 --> 17:04.501
HERE. CATCH!

17:05.873 --> 17:07.210
NOW!

17:08.949 --> 17:12.258
THIS SHOULD KEEP HIM
BUSY FOR A WHILE.

17:12.259 --> 17:14.866
BLAST IT!
GIVE ME THAT DISK!

17:15.869 --> 17:17.875
LET'S ROLL!

17:17.876 --> 17:19.646
ENOUGH GAMES.

17:21.353 --> 17:22.924
GIVE ME THAT.

17:22.925 --> 17:27.337
TURTLES, YOUR DESTINY
IS IN MY HANDS NOW.

17:36.967 --> 17:38.939
THAT MUST BE
HIS HIDEOUT.

17:40.043 --> 17:44.355
GEE, I ALWAYS
WANTED TO HAVE
A PET TURTLE.

17:44.356 --> 17:47.866
YEAH. IT'S TOO BAD
WE'VE GOT TO FLUSH HIM.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.140
NOT NOW,
YOU CRETINS.

17:50.141 --> 17:53.850
WE MUST CONCENTRATE
ON CAPTURING THE OTHER
TURTLES, TOO.

17:55.857 --> 17:58.030
LOTS OF LUCK,
PAL.

17:58.031 --> 18:01.541
SHH! HE'S ABOUT TO INPUT
THAT REPROGRAMMED DISK.

18:01.542 --> 18:04.148
PREPARE FOR PHASE ONE--

18:04.149 --> 18:07.257
THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE TURTLES.

18:19.562 --> 18:22.069
WHAT--WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:22.070 --> 18:25.914
OH, BOY. JUST LIKE
A SHOOTING GALLERY.

18:25.915 --> 18:29.391
YEAH. IT'S TIMES LIKE THIS
I WISH I COULD COUNT

18:29.392 --> 18:30.862
SO I COULD KEEP SCORE.

18:32.234 --> 18:35.075
STOP, YOU IDIOTS!
YOU'LL HIT SOMETHING.

18:35.076 --> 18:37.549
YEAH. LIKE TURTLES.

18:39.590 --> 18:41.360
HOLD STILL, MICHELANGELO.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.905
COWABUNGA, DUDES!

18:44.906 --> 18:47.780
HOW'D YOU MAKE
ALL OF THOSE MEs?

18:47.781 --> 18:50.422
EASY. I PROGRAMMED
THE DISK FOR INFINITE
REPLICATION.

18:50.423 --> 18:52.226
LIKE THEY SAY,

18:52.227 --> 18:54.902
YOU CAN'T GET TOO MUCH
OF A GOOD THING.

18:58.781 --> 19:00.986
SEE, YOU
MORONIC MUTANTS.

19:00.987 --> 19:02.826
NO MORE TURTLES!

19:02.827 --> 19:05.266
LOOK AGAIN, SHREDHEAD.

19:05.267 --> 19:08.142
FOUR--COUNT 'EM!
FOUR TURTLES.

19:08.143 --> 19:11.652
AND WE'RE HERE TO BREAK
YOUR NEW TOY.

19:11.653 --> 19:12.922
ALLOW ME.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.975
<i>MY SAI!
IT DISAPPEARED.</i>

19:18.976 --> 19:22.752
WHO'S GOING TO BREAK
WHOSE TOY?

19:24.860 --> 19:27.801
IT'S AN ELECTROMAGNETIC
FORCE FIELD.

19:27.802 --> 19:29.740
WE CAN'T GET THROUGH.

19:29.741 --> 19:32.682
I'M ALREADY THERE, DUDES.
CHECK IT OUT.

19:32.683 --> 19:35.357
YO, MICHELANGELO!

19:35.358 --> 19:37.597
MICHELANGELO!

19:37.598 --> 19:39.001
MICHELANGELO!

19:39.002 --> 19:41.576
WHAT'S HAPPENING,
COMPADRES?

19:41.577 --> 19:44.551
QUICK! THE SYNTHESIZER.
WASTE IT!

19:44.552 --> 19:47.327
RIGHT ON!
TURTLE POWER!

19:47.328 --> 19:50.804
HEY, BOSS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:50.805 --> 19:52.877
YOU GONE NUTS
OR SOMETHING?

19:56.021 --> 19:58.594
COWABUNGA!

19:59.598 --> 20:02.439
UHH! HUH?
WHERE AM I?

20:02.440 --> 20:04.947
HEY, HE AIN'T THE BOSS.

20:04.948 --> 20:07.454
HE'S A TURTLE
IN DISGUISE.

20:07.455 --> 20:10.062
WELL, LET'S
RIP IT OFF HIM.

20:10.063 --> 20:13.238
WHAT HAPPENED TO
MY BEAUTIFUL SYNTHESIZER?

20:14.610 --> 20:16.080
GREAT DISGUISE.

20:16.081 --> 20:19.657
YEAH. BUT NOT GOOD
ENOUGH TO FOOL US.

20:19.658 --> 20:22.299
OH, YOU IDIOTS!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:23.838 --> 20:26.779
THE SYNTHESIZER'S
GOING TO BLOW.

20:26.780 --> 20:27.849
LET'S BOOGIE, DUDES.

20:27.850 --> 20:30.290
WE BETTER GET
OUT OF HERE.

20:30.291 --> 20:32.028
THIS PLACE
IS HISTORY.

20:32.029 --> 20:35.438
OH, YOU TWO WILL BE HISTORY
WHEN I'M THROUGH WITH YOU.

20:35.439 --> 20:38.347
WE BETTER TAKE
THIS TURTLE
WITH US.

20:38.348 --> 20:40.788
YEAH. KRANG
WILL HAVE SOMETHING

20:40.789 --> 20:43.029
WE CAN PEEL OFF
HIS DISGUISE WITH.

20:48.546 --> 20:52.156
WELL, MASTER, WE DIDN'T
CATCH YOU-KNOW-WHO,

20:52.157 --> 20:54.998
BUT WE PUT A STOP TO
THEIR HOLOGRAM SCHEME.

20:54.999 --> 20:58.007
OK, EVERYONE.
DINNER IS SERVED.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.311
ALL RIGHT!

20:59.312 --> 21:02.287
MICHELANGELO,
NO PIZZA FOR YOU?

21:02.288 --> 21:07.770
PIZZA? YUCK!
I CRAVE PIZZA NO MORE.

21:07.771 --> 21:09.809
HOW FORGETFUL OF ME.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.849
IT COMPLETELY
SLIPPED MY MIND.

21:11.850 --> 21:17.365
MICHELANGELO,
YOU SHALL CRAVE
PIZZA ONCE AGAIN.

21:17.366 --> 21:22.347
UH, ON SECOND THOUGHT,
I CRAVE PIZZA ONCE AGAIN.

21:22.348 --> 21:25.022
I'LL HAVE TWO OF THEM.

21:25.023 --> 21:26.660
UH, NO. FOUR.

21:26.661 --> 21:29.669
WAIT A MINUTE.
BETTER MAKE THAT EIGHT.

21:32.044 --> 21:35.186
WITH HIS APPETITE,
WHO NEEDS CLONES?
