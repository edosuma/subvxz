[buck slurping]

00:33.149 --> 00:34.401
you want potatoes
with that, buck?

00:34.784 --> 00:36.286
You know I do, Miss fybel.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.904
Scattered,smothered and covered.

00:37.904 --> 00:39.406
Hank will have the same.

00:39.406 --> 00:40.407
Actually, uh,

00:40.907 --> 00:42.909
I prefer my potatoes
diced and chunked--

00:42.909 --> 00:44.411
I already ordered for you.

00:44.411 --> 00:46.379
Now listen up.
Chamber of commerce

00:46.379 --> 00:48.248
is puttin' together
a coed softball league.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.083
I want you to play
and be head coach.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.753
Head coach?
Like--like tom landry?

00:53.753 --> 00:56.673
Uh, I'm--i'm gonna need
a moment here, sir.

00:56.673 --> 00:58.174
[slurping]

00:58.174 --> 01:00.393
(thatherton)
what you got, buck?
Vanilla milkshake?

01:00.727 --> 01:03.229
Doctor wants you to put on
another 40 pounds?

01:03.646 --> 01:05.230
Get out of here,
thatherton.

01:05.230 --> 01:07.233
Oh, where are my manners?

01:07.233 --> 01:09.235
Allow me to introduce
the newest dispatcher

01:09.235 --> 01:10.737
at thatherton fuels

01:10.737 --> 01:12.238
mrs. Rita bevacqua.

01:12.689 --> 01:14.691
Bevacqua? Huh.
Is that any relation

01:14.691 --> 01:18.194
to former texas rangers
3rd baseman, kurt bevacqua
?

01:18.661 --> 01:20.330
kurt's my husband
by marriage.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.115
(thatherton)
the chamber of commerce
rule book

01:22.115 --> 01:24.284
says immediate family
is eligible to play.

01:24.284 --> 01:26.286
Husband falls
under the category

01:26.286 --> 01:28.288
of immediate family,
don't it, boys?

01:30.206 --> 01:31.257
Thatherton!

01:33.760 --> 01:36.179
I hope my picture isn't
at the edge of the page.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.465
Last year it just said
, "connie soup."

01:38.465 --> 01:40.967
Yeah, but I could
still tell it was you,

01:40.967 --> 01:42.852
even without
the "hanousinphone."

01:42.852 --> 01:44.804
You're so sweet,
bobby.

01:44.804 --> 01:46.689
I can't help it.

01:47.690 --> 01:49.943
You guys are a couple.

01:51.861 --> 01:54.364
Can you believe
they put that
picture in there?

01:54.364 --> 01:56.866
Yeah. Can you
believe it?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.495
hank, what
are you doing here?

02:08.495 --> 02:09.746
[gasps]

02:09.746 --> 02:10.964
did bobby do something
to his eye?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.382
No, no, no.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.717
Strickland propane is
gonna have a softball team

02:14.717 --> 02:16.136
.
and I was name
d the head coach

02:16.136 --> 02:18.004
well, congratulations, hank.

02:18.004 --> 02:19.472
My game went well.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.224
Thank you so much
for asking.

02:21.508 --> 02:22.559
Here's the best part.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.061
It's a coed league
with a woman-must-pitch rule.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.063
So you'll be pitching
for team strickland.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.482
But I already
pitch for a team, hank.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.350
The lady giants.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.318
But this is
a chance to play

02:32.318 --> 02:34.020
in a serious leagu
e against men.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.522
s
See how you do
against batter

02:35.522 --> 02:37.524
.
who can really put som
e aluminum into the ball

02:38.024 --> 02:39.325
I am in a serious league,
hank.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.244
Of course, you
wouldn't know how serious

02:41.744 --> 02:43.696
because you've never come
to one of my games.

02:43.696 --> 02:45.498
Peggy, you know
that tuesday's my night

02:45.498 --> 02:47.500
to drink beer in the alley
with the guys.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.252
It has been for years.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.089
Let's see, I got
enrique at shortstop

02:53.089 --> 02:54.841
and joe jack
in center field.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.627
I'll have to put
mr. Strickland at catcher.

02:57.627 --> 03:00.630
It's the only position
his cardiologist
would clear him to play.

03:00.630 --> 03:03.132
And he, uh, has to sit
on a stool.

03:03.132 --> 03:04.634
I wish you
could coach

03:04.634 --> 03:06.719
my army softball team,
hank.

03:06.719 --> 03:09.222
We don't have
any good leaders.

03:09.222 --> 03:11.057
That's classified.

03:11.057 --> 03:13.560
This chamber
of commie-erce league

03:13.560 --> 03:15.562
discriminates against
the self-employed.

03:15.562 --> 03:18.565
I'm a one-man
extermination corporation.

03:18.565 --> 03:19.949
How am I
supposed to play?

03:19.949 --> 03:21.901
Those are the rules, dale.

03:21.901 --> 03:24.871
You gotta have
a strickland pay stub
or be a strickland wife.

03:24.871 --> 03:25.989
[grunting]

03:26.489 --> 03:28.208
I've sprayed stricklan
d for termites.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.542
I have a pay stub.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.995
I'm on the team!
I'm on the team!

hey, connie,
wanna see me do a...

03:39.419 --> 03:40.837
[bobby yells]

03:42.171 --> 03:43.089
what a dork.

03:43.089 --> 03:46.226
My mom spent 2 hours
stacking those boxes.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.560
Got milk?

03:49.229 --> 03:52.432
'cause you got cookies.
Am I right?

03:52.432 --> 03:55.151
Connie, tell your
boyfriend to go away.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.186
He's hurting business.

03:58.187 --> 04:00.189
Just 'cause we're
on the "couples" page

04:00.189 --> 04:01.741
doesn't mean
he's my boyfriend.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.243
I know that.

04:03.243 --> 04:07.030
Uh, I--I just came to buy
a box of arrow girl cookies.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.668
[grunting]

04:11.668 --> 04:13.169
these cookies stink.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.288
.
They're waxy and stale

04:15.288 --> 04:16.372
[munching]

04:18.041 --> 04:20.343
bobby, maybe
you should go, ok?

04:25.598 --> 04:27.850
All right, debbie,
fire one in there.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.802
Let's see what
joe jack's got.

04:29.802 --> 04:30.803
[players chattering]

04:30.803 --> 04:32.272
get out of here, baby.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.108
(both outfielders)
I got it. I got it.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.894
(hank)
all right. Somebody pick up
the dang ball.

04:37.894 --> 04:39.696
[crowd chattering]

04:42.565 --> 04:43.733
[grunting]

04:44.734 --> 04:47.737
back it up, fellas.
I'm going deep.

04:50.740 --> 04:51.958
[dale laughing]

04:51.958 --> 04:53.409
doggone it, hank!

04:53.409 --> 04:56.496
Give me a boost
off this dang stool,
would you?

04:56.996 --> 04:58.498

05:00.333 --> 05:01.301
[buck grunting]

05:01.301 --> 05:04.387

that son of a bitch.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.254
[moans]

05:06.889 --> 05:09.759
mr. Strickland, sir,
throw the dang ball!

05:09.759 --> 05:10.927
[yells]

05:10.927 --> 05:12.395
no, I got him.
I--I got him!

05:12.895 --> 05:14.230
[screaming]

05:14.230 --> 05:16.482

an infarction!

oh, my god!
Mr. Strickland

05:19.652 --> 05:20.570
safe!

05:24.273 --> 05:25.525
[laughs]

05:26.025 --> 05:27.493
(hank)
you know,
my offer's still open.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.997
We could really
use a good pitcher,
I tell you what.

05:30.997 --> 05:34.500
Mmm. 'cause if you
can pitch as good
as you make cookies--

05:34.500 --> 05:36.502
My answer
is still no.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.787
And bobby baked them.

05:37.787 --> 05:38.671
What?

05:39.172 --> 05:41.174
I used double the butter.
Aren't they great?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.842
Better than the arrow girls'.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.795
Oh, god! You didn't join
the arrow girls, did you?

05:45.795 --> 05:48.381
No, and I never will.

05:48.381 --> 05:51.884
But I will sell more cookies
than troop number 159,

05:51.884 --> 05:55.555
connie souphanousinphone,
secretary-treasurer.

05:55.555 --> 05:58.558
Just don't wear the apron
out of the house, please.

06:00.893 --> 06:01.894
[ball bouncing off fence]

06:02.895 --> 06:04.897
ok, hank.

06:04.897 --> 06:07.200
I drove you here,
and I helped you
carry the bats.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.068
They seemed light
enough for one person,

06:09.068 --> 06:10.403
but what's done is done.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.655
,
Yeah, well,
as long as you're here

06:12.655 --> 06:15.792
maybe you could give debbi
e some pointers on pitching.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.044
Here, I brough
t your mitt.

06:18.578 --> 06:21.164
Goodbye, honey.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.000
.
(thatherton)
now I know
what stinks so bad

06:24.000 --> 06:25.301
strickland's pitching.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.803
Oh, what can they do?

06:26.803 --> 06:28.805
The league requires
a woman pitcher.

06:28.805 --> 06:32.809
Like I tell my gym class,
girls can't play sports.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.311
At least I found one
that can get it
over the plate,

06:35.728 --> 06:37.230
if you know what I mean.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.067
I'm having sex with her.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.568
[both guffawing]

06:42.568 --> 06:44.987
but she's no good
at sports, right?

06:44.987 --> 06:46.572
Oh, thatherton.

06:51.944 --> 06:52.945
Oh, yeah!

06:53.362 --> 06:54.864
[groans]

is the strickland bobtails!

07:58.678 --> 08:02.181
uh, you know, this team
didn't coach itself.

08:02.181 --> 08:05.184
He's right.
Nice job, hank.

08:10.740 --> 08:11.741
Oh, man!

08:12.241 --> 08:15.244
Did you see that
2nd bunt I laid down?

08:15.244 --> 08:18.748
They threw you out
in about 20 feet,
you sweet gazelle.

08:19.749 --> 08:20.750
[whistling]

08:20.750 --> 08:22.702
all right. Quiet down, team.

08:22.702 --> 08:25.922
Ok, I'd like to say
a few words as coach.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.841
That was a good team effort
out there, everybody.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.793
Joe jack, you got yourself
a couple r.b.i.s.

08:31.294 --> 08:32.094
Nice goin'.

08:32.094 --> 08:34.462
Enrique, dynamite job
of catchin'.

08:34.462 --> 08:36.182
Aren't you
forgetting someone, coach?

08:36.182 --> 08:37.683
All right. All right.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.019
I might be a little biased,

08:40.019 --> 08:44.222
but, uh, I did coach
one heck of a game,
I tell you what.

08:44.557 --> 08:47.059
So thank you,
and enjoy your pizza.

08:48.978 --> 08:51.480
And not one
of my beauty school credits

08:51.480 --> 08:53.983
has transferred
to junior college.

08:53.983 --> 08:56.485
It turns out you have
to get at least a "c."

08:56.485 --> 08:57.486
tsk.

08:57.486 --> 08:59.872
Never hurts to quit.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.908
I'm hungry.
Where's dad?

09:01.908 --> 09:03.910
Probably busy
patting himself on the back

09:03.910 --> 09:05.912
for giving birth
to you.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.132
Morning. Oops,
time to flip 'em.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.304
Uh-uh,
they're not ready yet.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.089
They're brown
around the edges, peggy.

09:17.089 --> 09:18.641
You don't want
to burn 'em.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.060
Hank, I have been
flapping jacks
for 32 years.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.061
Well, it's never
too late

09:22.562 --> 09:24.180
to learn how
to do it right.

09:24.180 --> 09:25.181
[grunting]

09:25.181 --> 09:26.816
here, let me show you.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.318
There is nothing
you can show me.

09:29.318 --> 09:32.104
Please be careful
with the pancakes.

09:35.491 --> 09:38.277
Don't buy inferior
arrow girl cookies.

09:38.277 --> 09:39.779
What are they offering?

09:40.279 --> 09:42.782
Oatmeal.
That's for breakfast.

09:42.782 --> 09:45.201
Mints. What are you, 60?

09:45.501 --> 09:47.169
And dog poop.

09:47.169 --> 09:50.039
What kind of flavor
is that for a cookie?

09:50.039 --> 09:54.176
.
Oh, my mistake.
That's their peanut butter

09:54.176 --> 09:55.678
hello, ladies.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.513
?
Bobby,
what are you doing

09:57.513 --> 10:00.967
I am trying to restore
the good name of cookies.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.218
Here, taste.

10:03.719 --> 10:04.720
[grunts]

10:04.720 --> 10:06.555
this tastes like mud.

10:06.555 --> 10:09.775
What? That's a lie.
You take that back.

10:09.775 --> 10:10.776
Taste it, connie.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.194
Don't do it.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.696
Don't let him
make you eat mud.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.197
This isn't funny, bobby.

10:15.197 --> 10:18.451
Connie, wait!
There's nothing wrong
with bobby's cookies.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.403
Look at me. I'm eating 'em.

10:20.403 --> 10:23.406
They've got your head
all turned around.

10:23.406 --> 10:24.907
[munching]

10:29.578 --> 10:30.880
.
sorry I'm late

10:30.880 --> 10:32.331
that's what I get
for picking

10:32.331 --> 10:34.634
the most popular
gynecologist in arlen.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.469
Well, try not to let it
happen again.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.970
I can't let
the players think

10:37.970 --> 10:40.973
i'm givin' you
special treatment
'cause you're, you know...

10:41.257 --> 10:42.591
The best?
...my wife.

10:42.591 --> 10:44.093
Good afternoon, luanne.

10:44.093 --> 10:45.311
Hey, uncle hank.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.179
Run along, now.

10:47.179 --> 10:50.149
.
Hank, luanne
has been my catcher
for the last 2 seasons

10:50.149 --> 10:51.984
I need her
behind the plate.

10:51.984 --> 10:55.104
Enrique is a nice man,
but he has got
a porcelain hand.

10:55.104 --> 10:56.522
I'm afraid
to throw full speed.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.491
Look, the roster's
already set

10:58.491 --> 11:00.693
and we already have 3 women
on the team.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.662
Did--did I
hear you right?

11:02.662 --> 11:05.781
You said you wanna replace
our catcher enrique
with this little filly?

11:05.781 --> 11:08.084
Luanne has a lot
of experience catching me.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.503
But I told her, sir,
that we didn't
have any room--

11:10.920 --> 11:12.538
Enrique, you're fired!

11:12.538 --> 11:13.956
[speaking spanish]

11:13.956 --> 11:16.959
huh. Just kiddin'.
Hank, stick him somewhere.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.353
[players chattering]

11:28.304 --> 11:29.638
(announcer)
strike 3!

11:29.638 --> 11:32.641
Put up another "k"
for peggy hill!

11:37.363 --> 11:38.731
[players shouting]

11:38.731 --> 11:40.199
peggy, peggy,
throw it here.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.200
[sighing]

11:45.121 --> 11:47.623
strike, dag on, 3, man.

11:48.074 --> 11:49.408
[all cheering]

11:51.127 --> 11:53.963
(woman)
looking good! All right.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.464
[crowd chattering]

11:55.464 --> 11:57.466
ok, let's walk
this next batter,

11:57.466 --> 11:58.968
.
set up the double play

11:58.968 --> 12:02.471
oh, hank, I can strike out
this lap dancer in my sleep.

12:02.471 --> 12:03.973
No, it's not
good strategy.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.975
Walk this gal,
and pitch to the one

12:05.975 --> 12:08.344
with the ridiculous implants
up next.

12:10.596 --> 12:12.398
[crowd yelling]

12:17.520 --> 12:18.654
[grunting]

12:20.406 --> 12:21.240
oh, yeah!

12:21.657 --> 12:22.608
[spitting]

12:29.365 --> 12:31.784
outfield shift.

12:31.784 --> 12:34.453
No, no, no, shift back.
That's right. Little more.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.206
[grunts]

12:40.459 --> 12:41.210
safe.

12:41.710 --> 12:43.262
What?

12:43.262 --> 12:45.214
Are you blind?
He was out by 2 steps.

12:45.514 --> 12:46.715
Hey, man, get--
Get out of my face!

12:46.715 --> 12:49.385
You haven't made
a right call
since this game started.

12:49.385 --> 12:50.219
[mumbling]

12:50.219 --> 12:51.353
this isn't about my wife.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.689
I'll kick your ass,
i'll tell you what.

12:53.973 --> 12:54.974
You're out of here!

12:55.474 --> 12:56.475
[grunts]

13:00.312 --> 13:01.063
peggy.

13:01.363 --> 13:02.648
Hello, hank.

13:02.648 --> 13:04.650
?
So, uh, did we win

13:05.151 --> 13:06.452
uh-huh.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.871
How could you
get me thrown
out of the game?

13:08.871 --> 13:10.706
Me? What did I
have to do with it?

13:10.706 --> 13:12.158
It never would
have happened

13:12.658 --> 13:15.161
if you didn't
shift the fielders bac
k after I moved 'em.

13:15.161 --> 13:17.163
You embarrassed me
as your husband,

13:17.663 --> 13:18.798
i--I mean coach.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.800
Well, coach, if you had
moved them to the right place

13:20.800 --> 13:21.967
in the first place--

13:21.967 --> 13:23.636
I told you
to walk that stripper.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.471
What--
That was a week ago.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.474
And I always got
to position players
in my other league.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.975
Oh, sorry. That's right.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.478
You wouldn't know that
because you never
came to watch me.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.347
Well, you never
watched me sell propane.

13:35.848 --> 13:38.851
Hank, I am sick and tired
of always batting last.

13:38.851 --> 13:40.519
It's not fair to me.

13:40.519 --> 13:43.022
You? You're the one
who won't run fast

13:43.022 --> 13:45.024
'cause you're afraid
your hat'll fall off

13:45.024 --> 13:47.026
and your bald spot
will show.

13:47.026 --> 13:47.827
[moaning]

13:47.827 --> 13:50.496
everybody wants
to be a superstar today.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.997
Nobody wants
to be a team player.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.000
You know, when the coach
told mickey mantle
to take a pitch,

13:55.501 --> 13:57.503
and he wasn't too hung-over
to see the sign,

13:57.503 --> 14:00.589
he took the pitch,
I tell you what.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.708
(announcer)
now batting for the army,

14:03.125 --> 14:07.012
william fontaine
delatur dauterive.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.965
[crowd chattering]

14:09.965 --> 14:12.301
all right,
I want you to throw him
some chin music.

14:12.301 --> 14:14.803
Get him off the plate
so he can't
put his gut into it.

14:14.803 --> 14:16.972
You don't know how
to position an outfield.

14:16.972 --> 14:18.941
.
You don't know
when to flip a pancake

14:19.441 --> 14:21.310
and you don't
know jack smith
about pitching.

14:21.310 --> 14:22.645
So back off, coach!

14:22.645 --> 14:24.613
I'm not asking
you as your coach.

14:24.613 --> 14:26.615
I'm asking you
as your husband.

14:26.615 --> 14:28.400
They're all looking at us.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.202
Well, I am not your wife.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.488
I mean, I am your...
Well, on the field, I am--

14:32.905 --> 14:33.906
[whispering]
I love you.

14:44.833 --> 14:45.918
Oh, yeah!

14:46.418 --> 14:46.919
[groans]

14:47.419 --> 14:48.420
[peggy gasps]

14:48.420 --> 14:49.421
[yells]

14:49.421 --> 14:50.923
i'm all right.

14:50.923 --> 14:53.225
I'm all right.

14:53.592 --> 14:54.810
[moans]

14:54.810 --> 14:55.895
[gasping]

14:56.395 --> 14:57.680
[moaning]

15:15.698 --> 15:17.700
ok, peggy,
I get the message.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.585
.
Now put it
over the plate

15:21.503 --> 15:22.504
[laughs]

15:22.504 --> 15:23.622
made your point.

15:23.622 --> 15:26.175
I am trying, hank.
I really am.

15:27.042 --> 15:28.294
[grunts]

15:28.594 --> 15:29.545
[fence clanking]

15:32.514 --> 15:33.515
oh, peggy.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.017
[mumbling]

15:35.517 --> 15:36.518
[groaning]

15:37.436 --> 15:38.721
[laughing]

15:39.521 --> 15:40.723
[moaning]

15:40.723 --> 15:41.974
[gasping]

15:45.728 --> 15:48.814
there's nothin'
wrong with you that
good coaching can't fix.

15:48.814 --> 15:51.150
Bobby, come on
in here, son.

15:51.150 --> 15:52.368
ok.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.736
[mumbling]

15:56.872 --> 15:58.374
all right. Play ball.

16:04.246 --> 16:05.247
hey!

16:06.215 --> 16:09.218
I--i--I can't find
the plate anymore.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.220
Without my pitching,
what am i?

16:11.220 --> 16:13.722
I am just one more
4-eyed boggle champion.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.224
Ok, here's your problem.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.226
You need to tuck
your elbow in more

16:17.226 --> 16:19.094
and release earlie
r in your windmill.

16:19.094 --> 16:21.513
Really? Are you sure?
I think--

16:21.513 --> 16:22.514
Don't think.

16:22.514 --> 16:24.016
Thinking leads
to overthinking.

16:24.016 --> 16:26.352
Just listen to your coach.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.827
(kahn)
oh, my god!
You killed my minh!

16:34.827 --> 16:36.445
Not really.

16:36.445 --> 16:38.447
But you really do suck,
peggy hill.

16:38.747 --> 16:40.199
[sighs]

16:43.202 --> 16:44.703
[peggy grunting]

16:47.339 --> 16:49.174
oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

16:49.675 --> 16:50.459
oh!

16:50.793 --> 16:52.044
Oh, yeah!

16:52.628 --> 16:53.962
ok.

16:56.048 --> 16:58.600
(hank)
we're playin' thatherton's
team today, luanne.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.102
.
Be careful

17:00.102 --> 17:02.604
he'll try
every trick in the book
to mess with the catcher,

17:03.105 --> 17:06.058
including the use
of off-color language.

17:06.058 --> 17:07.358
Tatherton!

17:07.776 --> 17:10.279
Luanne, while
the rest of arlen
was sleeping,

17:10.279 --> 17:13.065
I was out in the yard
throwing strikes.

17:13.065 --> 17:16.234
And it is safe to say
the pitch is back!

17:16.234 --> 17:17.736
[laughing]

17:17.736 --> 17:19.238
oh, peggy.

17:19.238 --> 17:21.740
?
Yeah. I'll bet
you were tucking
that elbow in, huh

17:21.740 --> 17:23.157
just like I told you.

17:25.327 --> 17:28.464
(boomhauer)
tell you what, man,
let's play some dang old ball.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.965
Here we go, peggy.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.467
Keep tuckin'
that elbow in.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.634
[crowd chattering]

17:33.719 --> 17:35.220
(boomhauer)
dang old. Dang old.

17:35.637 --> 17:36.755
Take your base.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.590
(luanne)
aunt peggy, watch out!

17:38.590 --> 17:40.142
[all yelling]

17:40.642 --> 17:41.927
[growls]

17:41.927 --> 17:43.929
who's ready to take
the cookie challenge?

17:44.346 --> 17:45.347
On the left,

17:45.347 --> 17:46.899
bobby's cookies.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.650
Fresh and buttery.

17:48.934 --> 17:51.520
On the right,
arrow girl cookies.

17:51.520 --> 17:54.323
Foul and musty.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.743
Bobby hill, you have mocked
your last arrow girl cookie.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.578
[screams]

17:59.578 --> 18:01.747
[girls muttering]

18:03.332 --> 18:05.367
hey, what are you doing?

18:05.367 --> 18:07.336
Connie, help!
Save the cookies!

18:07.786 --> 18:09.788
No, we're getting rid
of the mud cookies.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.590
Connie, smash 'em.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.595
[munching]

18:18.097 --> 18:19.098
hey!

18:19.098 --> 18:22.017
these are great.
They don't taste like mud.

18:22.017 --> 18:23.051
They taste like...

18:23.051 --> 18:23.936
Uh, butter.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.437
[groaning]

18:25.437 --> 18:26.638
double the butter.

18:26.638 --> 18:28.140
You lied to me.

18:28.140 --> 18:30.142
My boyfriend
is a cookie genius.

18:30.559 --> 18:34.062
Yeah, I am a cookie...
Boyfriend?

18:34.062 --> 18:35.647
man!

18:35.647 --> 18:36.982
[crowd chattering]

18:39.952 --> 18:42.371
(announcer)
going, going, gone!

18:42.371 --> 18:44.823
How are you fixed
for propane, thatherton?

18:45.908 --> 18:47.543
[crowd whooping]

18:47.543 --> 18:50.329
oh, there's a double
off the back fence.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.414
Thatherton takes the lead!

18:54.333 --> 18:57.553
It's the bottom of the 7th
and final inning.

18:58.003 --> 19:00.222
2 outs. Runners
on first and second

19:00.222 --> 19:03.842
and strickland
up only by a run.

19:05.260 --> 19:08.647
Hey, hank, your wife seems
to have lost her stuff.

19:08.647 --> 19:11.733
.
Maybe it's the presence
of a real man on the field

19:11.733 --> 19:12.768
no, it is not.

19:12.768 --> 19:15.270
Tuck that elbow, peggy
. Square your hips.

19:15.270 --> 19:18.574
Drive off the rubber
concurrent with
your release plane.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.826
.
Concurrent, I said

19:20.826 --> 19:22.161
[crowd chattering]

19:22.661 --> 19:23.662
[grunts]

19:24.079 --> 19:25.247
[gasps]

19:25.247 --> 19:27.366
the bases are juiced.

19:27.366 --> 19:32.004
Next up,
former texas ranger
kurt bevacqua.

19:33.455 --> 19:36.708
Time-out there, ump.
God dang it, hank!

19:36.708 --> 19:39.211
Thatherton's got
more people on the bases

19:39.211 --> 19:40.762
than he does
on his payroll.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.764
Oh, shoot!

19:43.265 --> 19:45.300
Your gal's broke,
hank. She's broke.

19:45.801 --> 19:48.720
Find a way to fix her.
You're her husband.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.223
Husband? What does that
have to do with...

19:52.391 --> 19:53.225
hmm.

20:01.984 --> 20:04.152
I got to make
a change, peggy.

20:07.289 --> 20:10.125
I'm sorry. I--I thought
I had it worked out.

20:11.710 --> 20:14.713
Debbie, you're playing
first base.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.549
And you, you strike
this ringer out.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.726
What are you
doing, dad?

20:27.726 --> 20:31.230
I'm making the best
coaching decision
I ever made.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.232
I'm taking myself
out of the game
