WEBVTT

00:12.583 --> 00:14.250
We're all around you.

00:16.583 --> 00:18.583
Living right under your noses…

00:20.583 --> 00:22.083
and you have no idea.

00:23.916 --> 00:26.625
Things were a lot simpler in the old days.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.208
We hunted you,

00:29.958 --> 00:31.750
and you hunted us.

00:33.541 --> 00:34.625
In Los Angeles,

00:35.541 --> 00:39.250
no one fought harder
than a place called Boyle Heights.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.791
So, we struck up a truce

00:43.875 --> 00:47.041
to maintain the peace
between our kind and yours.

00:47.541 --> 00:48.916
We lived in secret,

00:49.666 --> 00:52.625
and you convinced yourselves
you had never really believed.

00:52.708 --> 00:54.208
You forgot to be afraid.

00:54.791 --> 00:58.958
You made books and movies about us
and got most of the details wrong,

00:59.666 --> 01:01.125
while we became richer

01:01.208 --> 01:03.958
and more powerful
than you could ever imagine.

01:04.958 --> 01:08.125
To this day, there are some
who still uphold the truce,

01:08.208 --> 01:09.333
who keep our secret.

01:09.833 --> 01:11.958
As long as we stick to the three rules.

01:12.541 --> 01:15.041
Don't let humans know we exist,

01:15.125 --> 01:17.291
don't feed on the unwilling,

01:17.875 --> 01:22.708
and never ever enter Boyle Heights
without permission.

01:50.875 --> 01:52.583
-Jay!
-Sorry.

01:53.083 --> 01:55.708
-You scared me.
-I got distracted.

01:56.375 --> 01:57.625
How sorry?

01:57.708 --> 01:59.291
I'll-make-it-up-to-you sorry.

01:59.375 --> 02:01.541
Oh, you'll-make-it-up-to-me kind of sorry.

02:01.625 --> 02:02.958
How are you gonna do that?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.250
What?

02:17.333 --> 02:18.416
Nah, you look nice.

02:18.500 --> 02:19.958
I look nice?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.416
You're so stupid.

02:34.250 --> 02:35.083
What the--

02:35.166 --> 02:37.916
-What is it?
-They shouldn't be over here.

02:49.041 --> 02:51.375
-Oh my God. Jay, who is that?

02:51.458 --> 02:52.750
A dead man.

02:55.166 --> 02:56.833
Put the gun back.
We cannot do this.

02:57.416 --> 03:01.875
Holy shit, please keep driving. Jay.
Jay, it's green, just go!

03:10.250 --> 03:12.625
-Jay, what's going on?
-I gotta warn my guys.

03:12.708 --> 03:15.416
I need you to take the car
and go to your brother's. Okay?

03:55.375 --> 03:56.625
Maria!

04:35.875 --> 04:39.041
Good morning, Mr. Perez.
What were you dreaming about?

04:39.541 --> 04:41.416
Sorry. I…

05:35.000 --> 05:37.208
Hey, uh, B-plus, 60 bucks.

05:37.291 --> 05:39.875
Thank you, sir.
You're a lifesaver, you know that?

05:39.958 --> 05:41.875
You're saving my ass with this paper, bro.

05:45.250 --> 05:47.666
We're gonna check out
this club downtown, Three Kings?

05:47.750 --> 05:49.583
Table, bottle service.

05:49.666 --> 05:51.916
-Right.
-It's 300 a head. You wanna roll with?

05:52.000 --> 05:54.208
Shit, 300 a head? Uh…

05:54.291 --> 05:55.291
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:55.375 --> 05:57.833
Nah, I already got some stuff
I gotta get into.

05:57.916 --> 05:59.416
-I bet you do.
-Next time, my bad.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.875
All right. Stay easy.

06:12.416 --> 06:13.458
Yo!

06:13.541 --> 06:14.916
Yo, what's good, Benny?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.375
Hey, what's up, slick?
You got that kit for me?

06:17.458 --> 06:19.083
Let's call it an even 40, bro.

06:19.166 --> 06:21.625
40, like 40 bucks?

06:21.708 --> 06:23.125
-That's what I said.

06:26.708 --> 06:29.958
I'mma put The Heights
on the map. I'm telling you, bro.

06:30.041 --> 06:32.666
Step one, finish this track.
Two, set up the label.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.500
Three, world domination. It's simple.

06:34.583 --> 06:37.333
Building an empire,
but you can't even play me one track, bro?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.583
Hey.
When it's ready, it's ready, all right?

06:59.625 --> 07:01.000
Hello, Benny.

07:01.083 --> 07:02.208
Hey, Grandma.

07:03.541 --> 07:05.250
You came at a good time.

07:05.333 --> 07:07.041
Yeah? Why's that?

07:07.125 --> 07:10.500
I just took out
some flautitas and some empanadas.

07:10.583 --> 07:11.833
Nice!

07:11.916 --> 07:13.333
Are you hungry?

07:13.416 --> 07:16.208
You know it.
But why do I bother shopping

07:16.291 --> 07:18.250
if you're never
going to cook me a sancoche?

07:19.291 --> 07:20.916
You know I don't cook that.

07:21.416 --> 07:24.416
You know that one of these days
I'm going to buy you a house.

07:25.041 --> 07:28.166
I don't need
my own home, my love.

07:28.250 --> 07:31.291
What I do need is for you
to finish your studies

07:31.375 --> 07:33.250
so you can take care of yourself.

07:33.333 --> 07:35.833
Because someday
I'm gonna die, and so will you.

07:35.916 --> 07:39.041
Ay, Ma, why you gotta talk like that?
So negative. I don't like it.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.083
Well, that's life, son.

07:41.166 --> 07:42.708
We all come tumbling down.

08:06.166 --> 08:08.291
Bro, you told me
you could handle it.

08:09.166 --> 08:10.750
No, I told you. This is--

08:11.291 --> 08:13.666
Come on, Jessie,
you're really gonna do me like that?

08:14.875 --> 08:16.875
I need someone to cover the car tonight.

08:17.458 --> 08:18.708
It's about Maria.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.791
Yeah, well, I thought I could rely on you!

08:24.125 --> 08:25.291
Yeah, fine, whatever.

08:27.916 --> 08:29.291
Why are you creeping?

08:29.375 --> 08:32.291
If I'd know you was coming through,
I would've rolled out the red carpet.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.833
I have to pick up some things,
check in on Grandma.

08:34.916 --> 08:36.791
-Check in on your punk ass.
-Ha.

08:39.083 --> 08:43.125
Oh, wait a minute. What's this?
Bro, that some gray hairs on your head?

08:43.208 --> 08:45.208
Hey, I'm serious.
You're getting old, papi.

08:45.291 --> 08:47.375
-Just wait. It's gonna happen to you too.

08:47.458 --> 08:51.125
I don't know if you're working tonight,
but maybe we could go to Mario's,

08:51.208 --> 08:52.833
grab a pizza, watch the game.

08:52.916 --> 08:54.333
I got something else tonight.

08:54.416 --> 08:56.500
All right,
then who's covering the car, then?

08:56.583 --> 08:58.750
I had to cancel.
Everyone's booked up.

08:58.833 --> 09:01.166
All right, but you see,
I was thinking, like, what if,

09:01.250 --> 09:03.291
you see, what if I take the car? Right?

09:03.375 --> 09:05.083
-'Cause I could use the money.
-No way.

09:05.166 --> 09:07.125
-Why not?
-One, you're a bad driver.

09:07.208 --> 09:08.333
Bad… That's bullshit.

09:08.416 --> 09:10.166
When was the last time
you were west of K-Town?

09:10.250 --> 09:12.791
Hey, Jay, my man, look,
I am way more responsible

09:12.875 --> 09:15.000
than all them dudes
you got out there at the depot.

09:15.083 --> 09:18.291
Yeah, except them dudes at the depot,
they got chauffeur's license,

09:18.375 --> 09:21.041
they're insured by the company,
and they actually own a suit.

09:21.125 --> 09:25.875
I… You see, the thing is, though,
Jay, I got a suit. I got a suit, Jay.

09:27.458 --> 09:30.083
What, you and Maria been fighting?
That's what it is?

09:30.625 --> 09:32.875
You having some relationship issues?

09:32.958 --> 09:35.041
If you want to talk to me,
you can talk to me.

09:35.125 --> 09:37.208
I give great advice.
That's what people be saying.

09:37.291 --> 09:38.791
-Yeah, right.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.583
Man, whatever.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.458
Where'd you get that?

09:52.875 --> 09:54.041
Don't worry about it.

09:57.375 --> 09:59.791
-What's this thing you gotta do tonight?
-I said don't worry about it.

10:02.583 --> 10:05.875
All right. Fine, man.
I didn't even…

10:05.958 --> 10:08.333
-So secretive, man.

10:10.375 --> 10:12.208
-Hey, Benny.

10:12.833 --> 10:14.791
Scratch it, I'll kill you.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.083
Yo. You serious?

10:17.291 --> 10:19.916
Man! I'm gonna need me one of these.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.208
You can't afford it.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.875
Well, I'mma flip my beats,
and I'mma get me a better one.

10:23.958 --> 10:25.666
-What do you think about that?
-Listen to me.

10:26.166 --> 10:28.166
Take them where they need to go,
come straight back.

10:28.250 --> 10:30.375
-Understand?
-Yeah, I understand.

10:31.875 --> 10:34.041
-Check it out.

10:36.166 --> 10:37.125
Oh shit.

10:38.041 --> 10:39.375
-That's pretty cool.

10:39.458 --> 10:42.750
Insurance and registration
are in the glove compartment.

10:42.833 --> 10:44.625
Chauffeur's license on the visor.

10:44.708 --> 10:47.625
Everything's under my name,
so if anyone asks, you're me.

10:47.708 --> 10:50.041
-I'm going to Beverly Hills?
-Hey, pay attention.

10:50.125 --> 10:52.750
If anyone asks, you're me, got it?

10:52.833 --> 10:55.083
-Yeah.
-Dispatch says it's an all-nighter.

10:55.166 --> 10:58.083
Probably a twentysomething
director wannabe high out of his mind.

10:58.166 --> 11:01.041
Act professional, and he'll give you
a fat tip at the end of the night.

11:02.125 --> 11:04.666
Hey. Don't blow the sub, Dr. Dre.

11:04.750 --> 11:07.000
Look, if the subs want to bark,
you gotta let 'em bark.

11:07.083 --> 11:11.250
No, the subs don't wanna bark. Okay?
I'm serious. I'll yank you out of here.

11:11.333 --> 11:14.500
-I'll take the no-show penalty.
-Okay. No barking, you got it.

11:16.750 --> 11:17.875
Thanks for doing this.

11:19.750 --> 11:22.458
Hey, just, um, be careful, all right?

11:23.375 --> 11:24.500
I'm always careful.

11:40.708 --> 11:42.583
I got… I got the car!

11:47.083 --> 11:48.083
Huh? What?

11:52.666 --> 11:53.625
-Oh!

11:53.708 --> 11:55.166
That was a cop. That was a cop.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.291
What? I went in front of the guy!

12:39.500 --> 12:41.375
Wow.

12:42.583 --> 12:43.666
Wow, wow.

13:01.791 --> 13:03.250
Okay.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.000
Um, good… good evening, Miss Moreau.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.083
You're the driver?

13:21.083 --> 13:23.583
Uh, yeah. Yes. Yes, I am.

13:25.208 --> 13:28.708
Miss Moreau is running a little bit late.
I'm her friend Blaire.

13:29.625 --> 13:32.916
Okay, cool. I'm… I'm… I'm Jay.

13:33.833 --> 13:34.708
Hi, Jay.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.916
-Something wrong?

13:41.833 --> 13:42.666
No.

13:43.583 --> 13:44.500
Mm-mm.

13:45.291 --> 13:46.125
What?

13:49.041 --> 13:50.250
Your zipper is down.

13:51.625 --> 13:53.125
Oh shit.

13:53.208 --> 13:54.750
-Wow.

13:54.833 --> 13:58.333
Sorry, I… I… I don't…
I don't mean to be unprofessional.

13:58.416 --> 14:00.833
I just… I should…
I had no idea that it was down.

14:00.916 --> 14:02.541
-Yeah.

14:02.625 --> 14:06.041
I'm just gonna stop talking 'cause I feel
like I'm making it worse now.

14:06.625 --> 14:10.833
Well, how about you open the door for me,
and then maybe we can call it even?

14:11.833 --> 14:12.708
Thanks.

14:20.791 --> 14:22.166
Thanks.

14:37.583 --> 14:40.541
You know, if you need me
to adjust anything, like the…

14:40.625 --> 14:42.916
-like the AC, I… I can do that.
-Hmm?

14:43.000 --> 14:47.541
Or… or more warm, if you're like…
if it feels chilly for you 'cause I know--

14:47.625 --> 14:49.833
-Okay.
-You know, women's bodies--

14:49.916 --> 14:51.708
Women's bodies?

14:53.625 --> 14:54.666
I'm good. Thank you.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.458
Like, I know
people get cold, so whatever--

14:57.541 --> 14:59.083
Yeah. Thank you.

14:59.625 --> 15:00.833
Yeah. I got you.

15:03.541 --> 15:05.875
She's gonna be pissed
if you don't open the door for her.

15:06.416 --> 15:09.041
Oh.
You're right. My bad. Thanks.

15:16.958 --> 15:20.291
Hello, Miss Moreau.
I… I'm Jay. I'll be your driver tonight.

15:20.916 --> 15:22.416
You're adorable.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.041
Do you need help with your bags?

15:25.541 --> 15:27.375
You don't look like a driver.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.666
-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

15:43.625 --> 15:45.125
-Uh…

15:45.208 --> 15:47.500
Are you sure you know
what you're doing there, Jay?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.791
Um, no, I was just trying
to put the address in.

15:50.875 --> 15:53.791
Except I haven't given you
the address yet, have I?

15:55.083 --> 15:56.875
Right. Yeah. I know.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.208
We're hitting every one
of these parties tonight,

16:01.291 --> 16:03.750
and we need to get
to the last stop by morning.

16:03.833 --> 16:05.583
That's nonnegotiable.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.333
Are we clear?

16:07.416 --> 16:08.416
Yeah.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.208
Oh, and Jay, can you turn the air on?

16:11.291 --> 16:13.916
Yeah. Make it icy.

16:29.333 --> 16:32.208
Hey, driver. You wanna put on something
that doesn't suck?

16:32.291 --> 16:33.541
Yes, ma'am.

16:38.291 --> 16:39.416
Actually, Jay…

16:41.458 --> 16:42.833
let's play a game.

16:42.916 --> 16:46.625
What would you do if you knew
tonight was your last night on Earth?

16:46.708 --> 16:50.625
Wow, uh… I never really thought
about it, to be honest.

16:50.708 --> 16:53.125
-Okay. Well, think about it.

16:53.208 --> 16:54.708
I mean, you must have some fantasies.

16:54.791 --> 16:57.375
I don't… I don't really like
to think that way, you know.

16:57.875 --> 16:59.500
Like, to fantasize?

17:00.125 --> 17:02.166
Yeah, you know, it's like,
I'm doing things today.

17:02.250 --> 17:05.583
I'm building things for the future.
You know what I mean?

17:05.666 --> 17:09.291
-I'm not sure you understand how to play.
-I do. What I'm trying to say is--

17:09.375 --> 17:11.625
Last night on Earth, Jay.
Drugs, women, men,

17:11.708 --> 17:14.208
old enemies you're just waiting to pop.

17:14.291 --> 17:17.083
Nah, sorry,
I'm a pretty chill guy.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.541
You know,
I go to school, live with my abuela--

17:19.625 --> 17:21.458
You live with your abuela?

17:21.541 --> 17:23.375
-Yeah.
-That's cute.

17:23.458 --> 17:27.125
New game. Fuck, marry, kill.
Me, Blaire, your abuela.

17:28.541 --> 17:29.375
S… sorry, what?

17:29.458 --> 17:33.000
-I know you know this game.
-No, I do. I… I know this game.

17:33.083 --> 17:35.666
It's just, you know,
I'm trying to be professional.

17:35.750 --> 17:39.416
-Look, Blaire. Me, the Pope, the driver.
-You're not even trying.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.291
-Personally, I would bang me.
-Fine. Okay, you could get it.

17:42.375 --> 17:46.708
Kill the Pope, which I guess
puts me marrying Jay, the driver.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.750
-He seems like husband material.
-You hear that, driver?

17:50.833 --> 17:53.458
Come on, fess up.
Me, Blaire, your grandma.

17:53.541 --> 17:55.208
I'd definitely kill you.

17:55.291 --> 17:58.166
Finally, he bites back.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.666
Maybe he's not a total dud.

18:02.083 --> 18:04.500
I don't know. Maybe not.

18:06.708 --> 18:09.083
Hey, driver. Keep your eyes on the road.

18:40.833 --> 18:41.708
Thanks.

18:44.458 --> 18:45.541
Some party.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.791
You wouldn't know a party
if it fucked you in the face.

19:10.875 --> 19:12.208
What's up, G?

19:12.291 --> 19:13.500
What's the word?

19:15.583 --> 19:18.375
Three generations deep,
and I'm the one to break the peace.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.875
That's on him. Not us.

19:20.958 --> 19:25.125
Victor knows we're off-limits.
He's starting a war with Boyle Heights.

19:25.208 --> 19:28.458
He took Maria… to get to me.

19:30.083 --> 19:32.208
-There's no turning back.

19:32.291 --> 19:33.958
We have until tomorrow morning.

19:34.791 --> 19:35.791
After that,

19:36.291 --> 19:39.500
either Victor's dead, or we are.

19:41.791 --> 19:43.208
Let's go put this work in.

20:32.208 --> 20:35.083
-Back in the car, driver!

20:54.375 --> 20:55.416
Yo, Jay.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.875
You want some?

20:56.958 --> 20:58.875
Uh, I… I can't really do that.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.666
-Sorry.
-You can't?

21:00.750 --> 21:03.083
-I can't.
-That's boring.

21:05.083 --> 21:05.916
Zoé!

21:06.500 --> 21:08.666
-That's gonna be a fine.
-Oh, there's a fine?

21:08.750 --> 21:11.958
-Yeah.
-Don't worry, driver. We can afford it.

21:52.541 --> 21:53.541
Stay.

21:54.708 --> 21:55.625
See you soon.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.000
Hey, it's Jay.
Leave a message.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.833
Yo, it's Benny. Um, look,
I don't know what you're up to,

23:00.916 --> 23:05.166
but, um, I… I think there's
something… something weird going on,

23:05.250 --> 23:08.500
and just whenever you get a chance,
just hit me back, aight?

23:09.458 --> 23:10.375
Serious.

23:27.791 --> 23:28.916
Whoa.

23:32.958 --> 23:35.750
What the… Oh my…

23:35.833 --> 23:38.791
Oh, no, no, no.

23:52.083 --> 23:53.000
No, no, no.

25:01.625 --> 25:02.458
Hey!

25:30.500 --> 25:32.500
How may I help you, sir?

25:39.083 --> 25:40.625
Hi. Uh…

25:41.125 --> 25:43.000
-Sir, you are sweating.
-Oh.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.666
-Is everything all right?
-Yeah, yeah.

25:44.750 --> 25:46.541
-I, um… I was just…
-Mm-hmm.

25:46.625 --> 25:48.666
-I… I was outside and--
-What's that on your shirt?

25:48.750 --> 25:50.125
-Huh?
-Your shirt.

25:50.208 --> 25:51.250
I…

25:52.458 --> 25:53.833
I… I got, um…

25:53.916 --> 25:57.125
This is a members-only establishment,
so perhaps I should call somebody.

25:57.208 --> 26:00.083
-No, no, no, I'm fine. It's just--
-It's okay. It'll just be one second.

26:00.166 --> 26:03.083
No, no, no, no, hey, hey.
It's… it's okay. I just… I, um…

26:03.166 --> 26:06.833
Please accept
my most sincere apology, sir.

26:10.625 --> 26:11.458
May I?

26:14.041 --> 26:15.041
Yeah.

26:16.250 --> 26:19.083
Mmm. Will you be meeting anyone upstairs?

26:20.458 --> 26:22.125
Mm-hmm, yeah. I, um…

26:22.750 --> 26:24.750
I'm… I'm meeting the… the two girls,

26:24.833 --> 26:27.958
uh, Blaire and… and… and… and Zoé.

26:28.041 --> 26:31.041
Of course, sir.
They're with Daniel and Max as we speak.

26:33.375 --> 26:34.708
The owners, sir.

26:35.208 --> 26:36.083
-Great.
-Mm-hmm.

26:36.166 --> 26:38.250
-Yeah.
-Allow me to escort you to the elevator.

26:38.333 --> 26:39.208
-Mm-hmm, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

26:39.291 --> 26:42.041
Please, I don't…
I don't… I don't have all day.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.916
Should you need anything at all,

27:07.000 --> 27:10.375
there's a phone located in your room
that links directly to my desk.

27:10.458 --> 27:13.500
Myself or a member of my staff
will be happy to assist you.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
And, please, drink responsibly.

28:06.291 --> 28:07.125
Hey.

28:08.083 --> 28:09.041
H… hey.

28:11.083 --> 28:13.583
-This isn't what it looks like.
-Okay. I'm just…

28:17.208 --> 28:18.583
Oh my God.

28:19.083 --> 28:20.291
He's shaking.

28:20.375 --> 28:22.625
I love it when they shake.

28:22.708 --> 28:25.333
It's so cute.

28:25.958 --> 28:29.166
-Max over there tasted like motor oil.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.500
I bet Jay gives good blood.

28:34.250 --> 28:35.833
-Don't you, Jay?

28:36.375 --> 28:37.833
I'm not Jay.

28:39.208 --> 28:42.083
-What?
-I'm not Jay. My name's Benny.

28:42.166 --> 28:45.875
I'm just… I'm his brother.
I'm just covering for him.

28:49.166 --> 28:50.333
I knew it.

28:51.625 --> 28:52.958
What did I tell you?

28:53.708 --> 28:56.208
I knew this little shit
couldn't be Jay Perez.

28:59.041 --> 29:01.500
All right.

29:01.583 --> 29:03.250
Let's drink the driver.

29:03.333 --> 29:05.166
What? No, no, no, no.

29:05.250 --> 29:07.958
-I don't know. He could come in handy.
-Handy for what?

29:08.583 --> 29:10.958
I don't need someone
to hold the door for me tonight.

29:11.041 --> 29:13.000
-No.
-Wait, wait.

29:13.083 --> 29:14.875
I bet he could take us to Jay.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.000
Benny, do you think you could do that?

29:18.083 --> 29:20.000
You think you could show us
where your brother is?

29:20.083 --> 29:23.791
That was great.

29:28.541 --> 29:30.000
Oh, is he okay?

29:30.875 --> 29:32.666
Hey, Max, buddy!

29:32.750 --> 29:35.791
-Did they go a little too hard on you?
-You had one thing to do.

29:35.875 --> 29:38.166
-Just one.
-I know. I'm sorry.

29:38.250 --> 29:41.250
I got a little distracted
because someone walked in on us.

29:41.333 --> 29:42.541
Max!

29:43.416 --> 29:45.125
Hey, what's wrong with him?

29:45.208 --> 29:46.083
Max.

29:46.666 --> 29:48.500
-What… what did you do?
-Max?

29:48.583 --> 29:49.958
Hey, Max. You okay?

29:51.000 --> 29:54.500
Yeah, man, I'm fine.
I'm living my best life.

29:54.583 --> 29:56.333
Are you crazy? Is he…

29:57.375 --> 29:59.666
-Is he--
-He's dead. Yes, Daniel.

29:59.750 --> 30:02.125
Yes, he's dead.

30:02.208 --> 30:03.291
I killed him.

30:03.375 --> 30:05.041
-No, you can't do this.
-No?

30:05.125 --> 30:07.833
We're protected. This place is protected!

30:07.916 --> 30:11.791
You're protected?
How protected do you feel right now?

30:11.875 --> 30:13.750
Hmm?

30:13.833 --> 30:16.041
Blaire, finish your drink.
We're running behind schedule.

30:16.125 --> 30:19.791
-Hey. You stupid bitches.
-Mmm.

30:19.875 --> 30:23.000
They're gonna come after you for this.
The bosses will burn you alive.

30:23.083 --> 30:24.083
-Oh.
-Yeah.

30:24.166 --> 30:26.791
-You can't kill in here. It's off-limits.

30:26.875 --> 30:28.208
Oh, are those the rules?

30:29.250 --> 30:30.958
You can't. You're gonna ruin this place.

30:31.041 --> 30:33.750
Well, that's the point.
No more happy endings.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.416
-No, wait, hey!

30:35.500 --> 30:37.708
Wait, no, no, no. Don't, please, wait.

30:37.791 --> 30:40.583
You can't kill me.
You can't. What about the truce?

30:40.666 --> 30:44.041
-The truce is dead, handsome.
-Wait. Wait.

31:02.166 --> 31:04.583
Hey, uh, officer, listen. Um, I…

31:05.083 --> 31:07.291
I need… I need your help. I… I got this…

31:07.375 --> 31:09.291
It's an emergency.
There's these two women, right?

31:09.375 --> 31:10.958
-And they're after me and--
-Two women?

31:11.041 --> 31:12.333
-Mm-hmm.
-After you?

31:12.416 --> 31:16.291
Yeah, I've been… I've been driving them
around all night, but I think that's--

31:16.375 --> 31:18.250
Is there anything
you want to tell me about, son?

31:18.333 --> 31:21.791
-No, listen, I'm trying--
-How much have you had to drink tonight?

31:21.875 --> 31:23.333
-I haven't drank anything.
-Any drugs?

31:23.416 --> 31:24.541
-No drugs.
-Weapons on you?

31:24.625 --> 31:27.250
Listen, there's
this secret floor in there, okay?

31:27.333 --> 31:29.541
There's this crazy shit
that's going on in there.

31:29.625 --> 31:32.458
I need you to call backup.
I need you to call everyone, call--

31:32.541 --> 31:34.000
Exactly what'd you see up there?

31:36.416 --> 31:39.708
They killed these two guys, all right?
They were drinking their blood, man.

31:39.791 --> 31:42.125
Okay, that's enough.
Put your hands behind your back.

31:42.208 --> 31:44.000
Put your hands behind your back!

31:44.083 --> 31:44.916
Hey!

31:47.916 --> 31:50.125
Come on. Take… take me to jail right now.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.041
Get me… get me out of here.

31:52.541 --> 31:53.500
Mm-hmm. Let's go.

31:54.083 --> 31:56.375
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no.

31:56.458 --> 31:59.000
-What happens upstairs stays upstairs.
-No. Okay.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.583
-You should know better.
-Yeah, I'm not gonna say--

32:01.666 --> 32:04.625
-Get in the trunk. In the trunk!
-I won't say nothing!

32:04.708 --> 32:08.250
-I'm not gonna say anything!
-Excuse me, Officer Anderson.

32:13.333 --> 32:14.291
You girls.

32:14.375 --> 32:16.250
Yes, us girls.

32:18.500 --> 32:21.833
This kid is saying
you killed two men upstairs.

32:21.916 --> 32:24.041
-That can't be right, right?
-Of course not.

32:24.125 --> 32:26.583
Benny here has no idea what he saw.

32:26.666 --> 32:27.625
Do you, Benny?

32:28.208 --> 32:31.375
We just gave those boys
the best suck they're ever gonna get.

32:32.291 --> 32:34.000
Let him go. He's ours.

32:35.875 --> 32:37.333
Yeah. Victor know about this?

32:37.416 --> 32:38.958
What do you think, dipshit?

32:39.041 --> 32:42.250
We're just making our collections.
Business as usual.

32:42.333 --> 32:45.416
-Well, I didn't get a call.
-Oh, you didn't get a call?

32:45.500 --> 32:47.333
Maybe you're not important enough
to get a call.

32:47.416 --> 32:50.000
Yeah, maybe I should just call Victor now.

32:50.083 --> 32:51.625
Why don't you do that?

32:51.708 --> 32:56.750
I'm sure Victor would love to hear
from his favorite little piggy.

32:58.250 --> 32:59.583
Hand him over.

33:05.375 --> 33:06.833
Okay, all right. Fine.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.125
Go turn the car around.

33:20.833 --> 33:21.666
Huh? Hey!

33:23.583 --> 33:25.291
No more funny games.

34:24.666 --> 34:29.458
Wait! No.
Don't go! Wait! Don't leave!

35:00.750 --> 35:01.833
Yeah.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.291
-Yeah, you count this out?

35:36.416 --> 35:38.041
Back in the car, driver.

35:39.541 --> 35:40.541
Hmm.

36:25.333 --> 36:27.125
Don't get up. I know where the bar is.

36:27.208 --> 36:30.375
-What the hell are you doing here?
-I'm having a drink with my bosses, Eva.

36:33.375 --> 36:35.000
Better make it a good one.

36:37.750 --> 36:40.708
-It's gonna be your last.
-I'll keep that in mind.

36:41.291 --> 36:44.666
We told you what would happen
if you stepped foot in Boyle Heights,

36:44.750 --> 36:47.000
and yet, here you are,

36:47.083 --> 36:48.541
being reckless as ever.

36:48.625 --> 36:49.833
Drinking blood cocktails

36:49.916 --> 36:52.250
on white upholstery,
and I'm the reckless one?

36:52.333 --> 36:56.291
You need to remember your place,
Victor. You're middle management.

36:56.375 --> 36:59.416
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't call Martin right now.

37:01.541 --> 37:05.125
-Because I've had a change of heart.
-What heart?

37:06.333 --> 37:07.583
I deserve that.

37:20.958 --> 37:22.958
This view never gets old.

37:23.041 --> 37:26.458
Yeah. But now we're gonna have to ruin it
with your dead body.

37:28.458 --> 37:30.750
I should have let her do
what she wanted with you.

37:30.833 --> 37:33.916
I wanted to barbecue you
the moment you fed outside the lines.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.708
But Grace said that would be impulsive.

37:36.791 --> 37:39.458
I think the word I used was tacky.

37:40.291 --> 37:41.625
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

37:42.125 --> 37:45.458
I know you've never trusted me,
never given me any real power.

37:45.541 --> 37:48.166
But if you hadn't tried
to run me out of my own city,

37:48.791 --> 37:50.666
I wouldn't be seeing so clearly now.

37:50.750 --> 37:53.250
-Are you on something?
-You violated the truce.

37:53.875 --> 37:56.208
It's the one thing that's kept
our kind safe all these years,

37:56.291 --> 37:58.416
and you just pissed on it.

38:02.458 --> 38:06.666
For years we've been told
who to feed on and where

38:06.750 --> 38:09.291
and treating humans
like they're our equals.

38:09.833 --> 38:11.541
It started to feel like a prison.

38:12.375 --> 38:15.625
So I got frustrated
and did something impulsive.

38:17.166 --> 38:18.250
Should we say

38:19.875 --> 38:21.000
tacky?

38:21.083 --> 38:22.000
Tacky?

38:22.500 --> 38:26.500
You fed where you weren't supposed to
and started a war with Jay Perez.

38:26.583 --> 38:29.875
If he comes for us,
Boyle Heights will follow.

38:29.958 --> 38:33.083
Do you like your fancy clothes
and your concrete mansion?

38:34.333 --> 38:38.166
Because if we get exposed,
that all goes away. For all of us.

38:39.166 --> 38:40.125
I know.

38:40.916 --> 38:42.833
I put you two in a terrible position.

38:44.041 --> 38:46.208
Do you think that I don't get frustrated?

38:46.916 --> 38:51.208
Do you think that when my pool boy
leaves a leaf in the pool,

38:51.291 --> 38:54.958
that I don't wanna string him upside down
and suck him dry?

38:55.666 --> 38:59.625
But if I pitch a fit every time
somebody pisses me off,

38:59.708 --> 39:00.791
what does that make me?

39:00.875 --> 39:01.958
A man.

39:02.041 --> 39:03.250
Stupid as shit.

39:03.333 --> 39:04.333
Like I said.

39:06.666 --> 39:07.625
I'm sorry.

39:09.875 --> 39:11.125
No, a ban is a ban.

39:11.208 --> 39:14.208
You're gonna have to do a lot better
than that if you want me to reverse it.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.208
You know, forever is a very long time.

39:18.875 --> 39:21.458
Give it 40, 50 years.

39:21.541 --> 39:25.000
Who knows? Maybe this will blow over,
and you'll be able to come back.

39:25.750 --> 39:28.708
Oh, I think you've misunderstood.

39:29.666 --> 39:31.083
I'm not going anywhere.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.666
In fact, my girls
are down there right now,

39:36.583 --> 39:39.958
ripping your entire network apart
one neck at a time.

39:40.041 --> 39:45.083
So, everything you see belongs to me.

39:46.291 --> 39:48.250
After I kill both of you, of course.

39:49.250 --> 39:50.750
-Martin!

39:50.833 --> 39:54.333
I, uh, think you might
have to speak up a little.

40:01.333 --> 40:03.875
This is not real. This is…

40:03.958 --> 40:06.458
Come on. She's here, then she's there.

40:12.708 --> 40:14.625
-You need to calm down.
-Calm? Be calm?

40:14.708 --> 40:16.166
-You want me to calm down?
-Yeah.

40:16.250 --> 40:17.916
-I'm calm.
-Oh, you're calm?

40:18.000 --> 40:20.125
-Yeah. This is me calm.
-This is you calm?

40:20.208 --> 40:22.708
-You seem kind of worked up.
-What do you want me to do, huh?

40:22.791 --> 40:27.750
I'm here… I'm here in this car with…
with you and whatever the hell you are.

40:27.833 --> 40:29.166
-Oh.

40:29.250 --> 40:31.375
-This is… this is stupid.
-Oh, wow.

40:31.458 --> 40:33.041
-I… I honestly--
-So dumb.

40:33.125 --> 40:35.250
I don't expect people to understand.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.208
-It's a lot. It's a lot.
-Yeah. Yeah.

40:37.833 --> 40:39.708
Yeah, I mean, especially for you.

40:40.875 --> 40:42.666
What is that supposed to mean, huh?

40:43.708 --> 40:45.458
It means you're a kid.

40:45.541 --> 40:46.458
Like, you…

40:47.958 --> 40:51.958
You… you think majoring in economics
is gonna solve all your problems?

40:52.041 --> 40:54.166
Do you think
that this is how the world works?

40:54.750 --> 40:56.041
Okay. All right.

40:56.125 --> 40:57.083
Well…

40:57.791 --> 40:59.625
Don't worry.

41:00.708 --> 41:01.916
It'll all be over soon.

41:02.708 --> 41:04.500
All over? All over? How?

41:07.166 --> 41:09.958
Is… is my brother… is he like a, um…

41:13.125 --> 41:14.791
No, it's not like that.

41:14.875 --> 41:17.083
Then what's it like, then? What's it like?

41:17.833 --> 41:21.750
Let's just say your people
and my people don't really get along.

41:24.625 --> 41:26.250
Who do you think runs the city?

41:28.375 --> 41:29.458
Cops?

41:29.541 --> 41:30.791
Politicians?

41:31.750 --> 41:32.708
We do.

41:33.541 --> 41:34.416
We?

41:36.333 --> 41:37.416
Right.

41:37.500 --> 41:40.833
And… and our kind, like your kind,
answer to leaders.

41:42.083 --> 41:43.125
All right.

41:43.208 --> 41:46.583
There are five bosses that control
most of the major territories of LA.

41:46.666 --> 41:50.625
-It sounds like the mob.
-Please. We're not amateurs.

41:50.708 --> 41:52.541
Victor's, what, like, your boss?

41:53.375 --> 41:54.291
Your boyfriend?

41:55.250 --> 41:57.000
Oh, twist. Benny's the jealous type.

41:57.083 --> 42:00.416
No, no, no. I just…
I don't… I don't know what's going on.

42:01.291 --> 42:03.875
So, Zoé and Victor are together.

42:04.416 --> 42:06.000
And then, Zoé's my girl.

42:06.625 --> 42:08.208
So, she and I manage money

42:08.291 --> 42:10.458
at the different businesses
and blood clubs.

42:10.541 --> 42:12.500
-We manage the--
-Blood clubs?

42:13.250 --> 42:16.333
Yeah, but Victor's sick
of not having any real power,

42:16.416 --> 42:20.291
so tonight, we're making our move.

42:20.875 --> 42:23.250
The problem is you can't make a move
against one of the bosses

42:23.333 --> 42:26.958
without the rest of them
coming for your head unless you--

42:27.041 --> 42:30.083
Unless you take them all out
at the same time. Same night.

42:30.666 --> 42:31.666
Exactly.

42:32.666 --> 42:34.166
And… and my brother?

42:34.833 --> 42:36.875
Jay's crew runs Boyle Heights.

42:37.750 --> 42:41.541
They know what we are and how to kill us.

42:42.833 --> 42:44.958
Victor thought he could use him.

42:45.791 --> 42:49.083
Just turn Jay's crew loose on the bosses.

42:49.916 --> 42:52.958
Jay kindly instructed him to go to hell,

42:53.625 --> 42:56.500
which Victor didn't like very much,
so the plan was for us

42:56.583 --> 42:59.541
to bring Jay to Victor
after all of this was done.

43:00.541 --> 43:01.791
That was the plan

43:02.708 --> 43:04.375
until you showed up.

43:04.458 --> 43:08.500
So, Benny, you know
where your brother is tonight?

43:25.708 --> 43:28.250
Hey, no, you can't smoke that in here.
It's gonna…

43:29.125 --> 43:30.625
It's gonna get in the leather.

43:36.250 --> 43:37.166
That's funny.

43:38.791 --> 43:39.875
Mmm.

43:41.166 --> 43:42.291
You wanna hit this?

43:42.875 --> 43:45.875
-Honestly, it might make you feel better.
-No, I'm… I'm okay.

43:48.458 --> 43:50.125
Here. Let me.

44:04.791 --> 44:06.125
So, how did it go?

44:06.208 --> 44:08.333
Well, my shirt is ruined.

44:08.416 --> 44:10.416
I think we might actually pull this off.

44:10.500 --> 44:11.458
Yeah.

44:11.541 --> 44:13.000
Three bosses down.

44:13.083 --> 44:14.708
And two to go.

44:14.791 --> 44:17.250
Ah, you should've seen
the looks on their faces.

44:17.333 --> 44:19.416
I wish
I could've been there with you.

44:20.416 --> 44:22.000
So, how's Jay?

44:22.958 --> 44:24.083
Yeah.

44:24.166 --> 44:26.458
About that.
I… I need to tell you something.

44:26.541 --> 44:27.916
What is it?

44:28.000 --> 44:32.208
We, um, got his little brother instead.

44:34.833 --> 44:37.166
I'm sorry. We didn't know.

44:37.250 --> 44:38.583
It's okay, baby.

44:39.958 --> 44:41.750
It's okay. We can use the brother.

44:42.583 --> 44:43.416
Really?

44:43.500 --> 44:47.375
Really. It makes it more fun.
Think of him like insurance.

44:47.958 --> 44:49.041
Okay, babe.

44:49.958 --> 44:52.791
-Do you think he gives good blood?
-Yeah.

44:53.416 --> 44:55.708
I think he gives real good blood.

44:56.250 --> 44:59.625
I'll take care of Jay.
I don't want you to get distracted.

45:01.625 --> 45:05.083
Clear downtown and Venice.
Then the city is ours.

45:05.958 --> 45:08.250
We can't let them regroup after tonight.

45:15.583 --> 45:17.958
You sure about this? I don't like him.

45:18.625 --> 45:20.833
I don't even like breathing
the same air as this vato.

45:20.916 --> 45:22.666
This is the only chance we got.

45:23.500 --> 45:25.625
-What if we don't know where Victor's at?

45:26.333 --> 45:27.833
Gio made Victor.

45:28.583 --> 45:29.541
He'll know.

45:32.041 --> 45:33.750
-I want him alive.
-All right.

45:49.375 --> 45:50.458
Shit.

45:51.416 --> 45:53.291
What the hell happened in here?

46:01.833 --> 46:03.166
Sweep the house.

46:04.125 --> 46:06.041
Split up. Three and three.

46:06.125 --> 46:07.166
Watch out.

46:27.250 --> 46:30.750
Don't move. Move, I gotta put
this knife through your heart.

46:31.291 --> 46:33.291
I don't think you want that, do you, Gio?

46:33.375 --> 46:37.000
Right, baby. I don't want that.

46:37.083 --> 46:38.416
Yo, what the hell happened to you?

46:38.500 --> 46:40.958
Oh, don't look at me.
I look hideous.

46:41.541 --> 46:43.208
-You know what I need?
-Hmm?

46:43.291 --> 46:46.458
I need some blood.
Can you get me some blood, Jay?

46:46.541 --> 46:48.500
First, you gotta tell me
where Victor's at tonight.

46:50.458 --> 46:52.875
He's coming for all of us.

46:52.958 --> 46:56.000
All the bosses.
All the territories.

46:56.541 --> 46:58.250
He's clearing the board.

46:58.333 --> 46:59.625
Victor did this?

46:59.708 --> 47:01.041
His girls did this.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.458
-You know the ones.
-Haven't had the pleasure.

47:05.125 --> 47:08.541
His little monsters
left me like this to suffer.

47:08.625 --> 47:11.083
Hey. Hey, wake up.
Rise and shine, come on.

47:11.166 --> 47:13.208
-I'm awake.
-Where were they going?

47:13.291 --> 47:15.416
I'll tell you if you give me some blood.

47:15.500 --> 47:17.208
You gotta tell me what they said first.

47:18.416 --> 47:21.000
Three Kings.

47:21.500 --> 47:23.750
Get the boys. We're going downtown.

47:23.833 --> 47:26.875
But first, give me some blood!

47:52.583 --> 47:54.000
Can you hear that?

47:57.458 --> 47:58.958
What did I just smoke? I…

47:59.541 --> 48:00.541
I feel weird.

48:01.041 --> 48:02.375
Angel dust.

48:03.041 --> 48:05.250
-What?
-Relax.

48:05.333 --> 48:07.208
-I'm joking.
-Are you?

48:07.291 --> 48:10.250
Uh, maybe. Maybe not.

48:11.625 --> 48:13.458
Ask Blaire. She rolled it.

48:16.416 --> 48:18.416
That girl really needs to get laid.

48:20.875 --> 48:25.000
Well, that's a different kind of service
than the one this car company offers, but…

48:26.791 --> 48:28.708
That's good, Benny.

48:29.541 --> 48:31.166
Can I call you Benny Boy?

48:31.916 --> 48:32.750
No.

48:36.041 --> 48:39.083
You know, it's not your fault
that she likes you.

48:39.833 --> 48:43.708
She likes everyone,
so don't feel special or anything.

48:43.791 --> 48:47.250
Yeah, I know,
it's not… it's not like that.

48:47.333 --> 48:50.250
I… I mean, I'm not…
I'm not saying she isn't attractive.

48:50.333 --> 48:53.833
I'm just not really looking
for a relationship right now.

48:53.916 --> 48:55.250
Is he looking at me?

48:57.583 --> 48:58.750
Who?

48:58.833 --> 48:59.916
The clerk.

49:00.875 --> 49:04.041
I… I don't think so.

49:04.125 --> 49:05.083
You sure?

49:05.166 --> 49:06.083
Yeah, you know.

49:06.583 --> 49:08.541
Nobody's looking at you, Zoé.

49:08.625 --> 49:09.875
He's calling someone.

49:11.208 --> 49:12.041
Zoé.

49:12.125 --> 49:14.666
Zoé, chill, yo. Hey. Chill.

49:14.750 --> 49:18.166
…three bodies appeared
to have been drained of all blood.

49:18.250 --> 49:19.583
Wait.

49:19.666 --> 49:20.875
Just a slushy?

49:20.958 --> 49:23.333
-Yeah, just the slushy.
-Okay.

49:23.416 --> 49:25.708
-Is that…
-Okay, that's gonna be two--

49:27.833 --> 49:29.750
-Who was on the phone?

49:29.833 --> 49:31.666
-Do we really have to do this?
-Take the money!

49:31.750 --> 49:33.666
Get out of here, okay?
I don't want any trouble!

49:33.750 --> 49:34.833
You a tattletale?

49:34.916 --> 49:37.625
-What? You're insane!

49:37.708 --> 49:40.208
-Get her off of me! Do something!
-Just do what she says, man.

49:40.291 --> 49:42.625
-Who was on the phone?
-It was my mom!

49:42.708 --> 49:46.500
Okay? She just wanted me to pick up
more cat food on the way home from work.

49:46.583 --> 49:50.291
I swear to God. I just…
Jesus Christ, are those…

49:50.375 --> 49:51.416
Shut him up!

49:51.500 --> 49:53.625
Shut him up?
What do you mean, shut him up? No!

49:55.833 --> 49:58.708
-That's my girl.

49:58.791 --> 50:00.333
-Let's go.

50:05.000 --> 50:05.833
What?

50:05.916 --> 50:07.791
What is wrong with you?

50:08.416 --> 50:11.875
You can't be alive for 200 years
and not go a little crazy.

50:43.250 --> 50:45.625
What should we do with Benny?

50:45.708 --> 50:47.875
I mean,
we can't just leave him in the car.

50:47.958 --> 50:50.666
Hey, so, um, listen,
I… I got this idea, right?

50:50.750 --> 50:53.250
And I… I was thinking,
maybe why don't I just go?

50:53.333 --> 50:55.416
You guys can just take the car,

50:55.500 --> 50:59.000
and… and… and… and I'll find my way home.
I'll find a bus.

50:59.083 --> 51:01.375
-It sounds like you're trying to ditch us.
-No, I'm not--

51:01.458 --> 51:05.833
Hey, you know what? I actually think
that's a really smart idea.

51:05.916 --> 51:07.083
Yeah?

51:07.166 --> 51:08.125
Yeah.

51:08.208 --> 51:11.250
Yeah. You know,
'cause, you know, all… all this shit,

51:11.333 --> 51:13.666
I'm not gonna say nothing about all this.

51:13.750 --> 51:17.958
I just think this is a time where I feel
like we should go our separate ways,

51:18.041 --> 51:21.166
and… and believe me, it was…
it was great meeting you guys, you know.

51:21.250 --> 51:24.708
-It was great meeting you too.
-And the secrets, they're safe with me.

51:24.791 --> 51:26.333
-It's me, you know.
-Okay.

51:26.416 --> 51:28.416
Well, if he says
he's not gonna say anything,

51:28.500 --> 51:31.000
then we can trust him.

51:31.083 --> 51:31.958
Right?

51:32.041 --> 51:34.666
-Sweet. Uh, okay, great. I mean--

51:34.750 --> 51:37.375
You're gonna stick around
a little while longer, Benny Boy.

51:37.458 --> 51:39.583
-We're not quite through.

51:39.666 --> 51:42.833
You remember what I did
to that guy at the hotel?

51:45.458 --> 51:48.166
I tore his neck open like a bag of candy.

51:48.666 --> 51:51.625
If you do anything stupid inside,

51:52.375 --> 51:54.541
I'll start stacking bodies.

51:55.541 --> 51:57.666
I think what she's trying to say,

51:57.750 --> 52:00.375
Benny, is we would love
if you came with us.

52:01.208 --> 52:02.125
-Good?

52:03.041 --> 52:05.875
-Fun! Fun!

52:08.416 --> 52:10.791
Hey, uh, your friend over there?

52:10.875 --> 52:13.291
Yeah, she's insane.
I'm talking next-level crazy.

52:13.375 --> 52:15.958
Yeah. You wanna stay out of her way. Okay?

52:16.041 --> 52:18.291
I gotta get out of here.
I can't do this shit.

52:18.791 --> 52:21.791
I need you to be smart. All right?
If you do anything stupid,

52:21.875 --> 52:24.375
like try and run or tell anyone about us,

52:24.458 --> 52:28.250
I'm gonna have to kill you. Okay?
And I don't want to have to do that.

52:28.333 --> 52:29.708
-Bruce!
-Hey.

52:29.791 --> 52:33.125
You don't want to have to kill me.
Great, I mean, that's fantastic.

52:33.208 --> 52:34.500
I'm looking out for you.

52:34.583 --> 52:37.916
-You call this looking out for somebody?
-Benny! Come on.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.750
-Hey.
-Excuse me.

52:42.125 --> 52:43.666
-Benny?
-Go on, man.

52:43.750 --> 52:44.833
Oh, no way.

52:45.375 --> 52:48.666
Hey, um, do you think
you could help us out?

52:49.250 --> 52:51.875
You know, tell them
that we're your friends.

52:51.958 --> 52:53.750
Like, we're with you or something?

52:53.833 --> 52:55.000
Please?

52:55.791 --> 52:58.083
Sorry, I don't know. I… I just, uh…

52:58.166 --> 53:01.166
He can't help you because he is the help.

53:01.250 --> 53:04.458
I mean, look at him.
Looks like a butler or something.

53:04.541 --> 53:05.666
Uh…

53:05.750 --> 53:07.083
Oh shit.

53:07.166 --> 53:09.250
-I was right?

53:34.875 --> 53:36.708
Benny has his hands full tonight.

53:38.166 --> 53:40.458
Maybe find someone else to leech onto.

53:41.708 --> 53:43.083
Do us a favor.

53:43.166 --> 53:45.375
Send the Gen Z
off to the back of the line.

53:46.166 --> 53:47.791
Back of the line. Let's go.

53:47.875 --> 53:49.083
-You kidding?
-Wait. No.

53:49.166 --> 53:51.208
-You heard me. Not tonight.
-Look, no--

53:57.041 --> 53:58.333
What are you looking at?

53:58.958 --> 54:01.458
I don't think
I've ever met anybody like you.

54:02.708 --> 54:05.833
Well, don't get weird.
I was just trying to make you look cool.

54:06.708 --> 54:08.750
Yeah, well, it worked.

54:10.250 --> 54:12.416
I don't know why you care what they think.

54:12.500 --> 54:13.333
I don't.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.166
You're never gonna remember their faces.
They're insignificant.

54:17.250 --> 54:18.666
What does that make me?

54:19.250 --> 54:21.125
I guess we're gonna have to find out.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.041
Whoa.

54:36.125 --> 54:37.166
Busy night.

54:37.250 --> 54:39.708
Yeah.
And not a lot of friendly faces.

54:39.791 --> 54:41.375
Let's keep this cool and quiet.

54:41.458 --> 54:44.041
-I hate going in quiet.
-Zoé.

54:44.125 --> 54:46.250
You wanna get the bag, I'll get Big Lou?

54:46.333 --> 54:47.416
Mm-hmm.

54:48.375 --> 54:50.583
It might get a little messy in there.

54:51.583 --> 54:54.958
-Drink up. You won't feel a thing.

54:59.291 --> 55:01.458
There'll be
a lot of sharp teeth in there.

55:01.541 --> 55:04.333
Nobody makes a move
until we see Victor's girls, all right?

55:04.833 --> 55:05.791
Y'all hear that?

55:30.541 --> 55:31.958
Good evening, ladies.

55:32.041 --> 55:33.916
Who are you? Where's Big Lou?

55:34.000 --> 55:35.875
Big Lou is no longer with us.

55:37.541 --> 55:39.083
Don't you recognize me?

55:40.750 --> 55:42.666
I don't think we've had the pleasure.

56:00.500 --> 56:03.125
I don't like this. We should move.

56:04.750 --> 56:06.625
We're not going anywhere yet.

56:08.125 --> 56:10.458
Lost a lot of friends
to things like you.

56:11.958 --> 56:13.083
You don't remember me?

56:13.791 --> 56:15.041
Remember what?

56:15.125 --> 56:19.500
I gave you that,
but I didn't get to finish the job.

56:19.583 --> 56:21.791
LA was always off-limits.

56:23.125 --> 56:25.250
Yeah, I think it's brave
what you're doing,

56:25.750 --> 56:27.750
stepping out on your own like this.

56:27.833 --> 56:30.208
But, if you break the rules,

56:30.291 --> 56:32.791
you lose certain protections.

56:32.875 --> 56:37.416
I mean, with the truce falling apart,
it's open season on you freaks.

56:38.583 --> 56:39.625
See my friend here?

56:41.000 --> 56:44.375
She can drain your whole body
before you even pull the trigger.

56:46.083 --> 56:48.708
You think I'm here alone?

56:57.250 --> 56:58.416
Oh…

56:59.125 --> 57:00.541
What were you saying?

57:53.666 --> 57:55.791
Ah. Look at them.

57:56.625 --> 57:57.958
For once,

57:59.583 --> 58:00.708
they're helpless.

58:08.541 --> 58:09.750
Kill them.

58:39.375 --> 58:40.958
Who still uses crossbows?

58:42.541 --> 58:43.708
Night Legion.

58:48.791 --> 58:51.583
-What?
-You asked who still uses crossbows.

58:51.666 --> 58:54.791
Night Legion does.
They like to hunt things like us.

58:54.875 --> 58:56.625
They've been at it for centuries.

58:57.416 --> 59:02.458
And Benny, like, totally bottles them
in the face, apparently.

59:02.541 --> 59:03.666
Yes, he does.

59:04.250 --> 59:08.083
Come on.
These scumbags are like cockroaches.

59:09.625 --> 59:12.125
When there's one, there's many.

1:00:11.250 --> 1:00:12.250
Benny!

1:00:20.500 --> 1:00:21.791
Is there a problem?

1:00:21.875 --> 1:00:24.166
-You know you're not allowed to be here.
-Move.

1:00:24.958 --> 1:00:26.083
No.

1:00:41.375 --> 1:00:42.625
Oh shit!

1:00:48.916 --> 1:00:51.833
-We gotta get off the streets.
-Yeah, we need to lay low.

1:00:51.916 --> 1:00:53.875
Is there someplace safe you could take us?

1:00:53.958 --> 1:00:55.833
No. We're not going anywhere
until I find out

1:00:55.916 --> 1:00:58.000
where this Victor is
and what he wants from my brother.

1:00:58.083 --> 1:00:59.541
Well, look at you.

1:00:59.625 --> 1:01:02.708
Benny Boy. Making demands
like he's running the show tonight.

1:01:03.208 --> 1:01:04.583
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

1:01:04.666 --> 1:01:07.375
I like you, Benny.
I think you're kind of sweet,

1:01:07.458 --> 1:01:10.083
so I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

1:01:10.166 --> 1:01:13.750
Victor's gonna find Jay tonight,
and when he does, well…

1:01:13.833 --> 1:01:15.208
Well? Well, what?

1:01:15.291 --> 1:01:18.625
Well, if you stick with us,
then maybe we could get to Jay first,

1:01:18.708 --> 1:01:21.333
and we could convince Victor
to go easy on him.

1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:23.375
So, Benny, what's it gonna be?

1:01:23.458 --> 1:01:25.416
You wanna see your brother,
or you wanna piss off?

1:01:25.500 --> 1:01:26.750
-Shit!

1:01:28.166 --> 1:01:29.000
Run!

1:01:43.708 --> 1:01:46.250
Come on! Try and get me, dickheads!

1:02:08.041 --> 1:02:09.125
Crazy night, huh?

1:02:11.791 --> 1:02:13.583
Tell him to put his gear down.

1:02:18.166 --> 1:02:19.375
It's all right.

1:02:20.041 --> 1:02:23.666
You see the light now, don't you?
I heard what they did to your girl.

1:02:24.250 --> 1:02:28.166
I know what that's like.
We all do. That's why we're out here.

1:02:28.250 --> 1:02:30.000
We got resources. We got a network.

1:02:30.083 --> 1:02:32.708
Wake up, Jay.
You can't beat them on your own.

1:02:33.375 --> 1:02:34.875
Yeah, I don't wanna beat them.

1:02:36.166 --> 1:02:37.166
I want Victor.

1:02:39.083 --> 1:02:39.958
Okay.

1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.583
If you survive the night,

1:02:43.875 --> 1:02:45.083
come find me.

1:02:54.083 --> 1:02:55.416
Hey, uh, Benny?

1:02:57.083 --> 1:02:58.875
Are you sure that we're safe here?

1:02:59.500 --> 1:03:02.583
Yeah, of course. Nowhere safer.
I've lived here my whole life.

1:03:02.666 --> 1:03:05.250
-I know, I just meant maybe--
-Listen, um…

1:03:05.333 --> 1:03:08.208
So, my grandma works nights,
but sometimes she comes home early.

1:03:08.291 --> 1:03:12.083
So, all I'm asking
is that you guys be quiet, please.

1:03:12.166 --> 1:03:13.625
-I got it. Yes.
-You got it?

1:03:13.708 --> 1:03:16.083
We will be on our best behavior.

1:03:17.041 --> 1:03:18.000
Right, Zoé?

1:03:32.500 --> 1:03:34.250
-Well, this is quaint.
-Shh.

1:03:34.333 --> 1:03:36.083
-Hey! It's me!

1:03:36.166 --> 1:03:38.541
Oh my God!
I almost killed you!

1:03:38.625 --> 1:03:41.250
All day by myself!
If you're gonna be studying--

1:03:42.791 --> 1:03:43.750
Hello.

1:03:45.166 --> 1:03:48.208
Can you please put the bat down? Please?

1:03:50.208 --> 1:03:51.583
-Where have you been?
-I--

1:03:51.666 --> 1:03:53.958
These two
don't look like college students.

1:03:54.041 --> 1:03:56.375
Look, I…
I lost my phone and, uh…

1:03:56.458 --> 1:03:58.958
Blaire, Zoé, this is my grandma, Rosa.

1:03:59.041 --> 1:04:02.583
Grandma, this is Blaire and… and Zoé.

1:04:03.166 --> 1:04:04.250
-'Sup?
-Hey.

1:04:04.333 --> 1:04:07.958
Okay. Good night now. Have a nice evening.

1:04:09.583 --> 1:04:11.458
Listen, they're waiting for a ride,

1:04:11.541 --> 1:04:14.250
so I was thinking maybe they could,
you know, wait here a bit.

1:04:14.333 --> 1:04:15.958
What happened to your hand?

1:04:16.041 --> 1:04:18.125
No, it's fine.
I'll get a Band-Aid--

1:04:18.208 --> 1:04:19.791
What Band-Aid? No Band-Aid!

1:04:19.875 --> 1:04:22.458
-You're gonna need stitches!
-Ma, it's okay. It's okay.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.625
-Who did this to you?

1:04:26.708 --> 1:04:29.041
Nothing. It was an accident.

1:04:30.416 --> 1:04:32.333
Yo, that was a bloodbath, G.

1:04:33.125 --> 1:04:36.333
We keep going like this,
it's suicide for sure.

1:04:42.541 --> 1:04:43.375
Damn.

1:04:58.291 --> 1:05:00.833
Hands on the dash.
Eyes forward.

1:05:02.875 --> 1:05:06.083
You. You got any weapons
or drugs in the vehicle?

1:05:06.666 --> 1:05:07.750
No, sir.

1:05:08.291 --> 1:05:09.500
Hey. Hands.

1:05:10.333 --> 1:05:12.375
-My ID.
-I don't need to see that.

1:05:12.458 --> 1:05:14.375
I know who the two of you are.

1:05:14.958 --> 1:05:17.666
Victor would like to meet for a drink.

1:05:17.750 --> 1:05:19.041
Rosso Puro.

1:05:20.125 --> 1:05:21.125
Thirty minutes.

1:05:21.208 --> 1:05:22.333
We're free to go?

1:05:22.416 --> 1:05:24.250
Oh yeah. I almost forgot.

1:05:25.125 --> 1:05:25.958
Benny says hi.

1:05:32.875 --> 1:05:34.791
How did this happen to you?

1:05:35.291 --> 1:05:37.375
Grandma, that is a long story.

1:05:38.541 --> 1:05:40.625
But I swear I'll tell you later.

1:05:40.708 --> 1:05:41.583
Okay?

1:05:42.333 --> 1:05:43.500
Do they speak Spanish?

1:05:43.583 --> 1:05:44.625
I don't know.

1:05:46.125 --> 1:05:48.458
Is this little Benny?

1:05:48.541 --> 1:05:49.916
Yo, put that back.

1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:51.500
No. It's so good.

1:05:52.708 --> 1:05:53.541
You know,

1:05:55.125 --> 1:05:57.083
Benny's never brought a girl home before.

1:05:57.166 --> 1:05:59.458
-Let alone two.
-Abuela, seriously?

1:05:59.541 --> 1:06:00.791
What?

1:06:03.458 --> 1:06:05.125
Can I help you out with that?

1:06:06.291 --> 1:06:08.625
I… That's okay.

1:06:09.208 --> 1:06:11.041
I… I think we're fine here.

1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:13.166
Thank you, dear.

1:06:29.875 --> 1:06:34.000
Yeah, all right,
you know what? I think we're good here.

1:06:34.083 --> 1:06:37.083
You know, I feel good.
Hand feels good. Uh…

1:06:37.166 --> 1:06:39.666
You… uh, you… you… you feel good?

1:06:39.750 --> 1:06:43.750
Do I feel good? You woke me up
in the middle of the night, Benny.

1:06:44.625 --> 1:06:47.833
I'm… I'm sorry, but maybe
you should get back to sleep?

1:06:50.458 --> 1:06:52.708
I like this one better
than the other one.

1:06:54.333 --> 1:06:57.291
But be careful.
I don't need great-grandchildren.

1:06:59.125 --> 1:07:00.750
Good evening, Rosa.

1:07:00.833 --> 1:07:02.125
It was a pleasure.

1:07:08.041 --> 1:07:10.916
-What's wrong, baby?
-We got jumped downtown.

1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.125
Night Legion was all over us.

1:07:13.208 --> 1:07:15.000
At least they took care of Big Lou.

1:07:15.583 --> 1:07:17.041
How many did you kill?

1:07:17.125 --> 1:07:17.958
Three.

1:07:18.041 --> 1:07:21.625
Maybe four. Boyle Heights was there too.

1:07:22.750 --> 1:07:25.083
I thought you said
you were gonna take care of Jay.

1:07:25.791 --> 1:07:28.208
Don't worry.
I'm on my way to meet Jay.

1:07:28.291 --> 1:07:29.583
Just stopped for a drink.

1:07:29.666 --> 1:07:30.541
Okay.

1:07:31.833 --> 1:07:34.750
I don't know. I'm getting worried.

1:07:35.541 --> 1:07:37.750
This night's going sideways.

1:07:37.833 --> 1:07:40.083
We can't stop now. We're nearly done.

1:07:41.208 --> 1:07:43.916
I'm gonna drain the kid.
I'm gonna smother the grandma,

1:07:44.541 --> 1:07:46.166
and we can hit Venice tomorrow.

1:07:46.250 --> 1:07:49.708
We need to clear Venice tonight.
Rocko is too unpredictable.

1:07:49.791 --> 1:07:52.416
If we mess this up,
there will be no tomorrow.

1:07:52.500 --> 1:07:54.750
-Venice is the last kill.

1:07:54.833 --> 1:07:56.791
-I know you can do it.

1:07:56.875 --> 1:07:59.625
Just keep a hold of the kid,
and we'll party at dawn.

1:08:01.083 --> 1:08:02.541
The world will be ours, babe,

1:08:03.125 --> 1:08:04.375
just me and you.

1:08:08.041 --> 1:08:08.875
Yeah.

1:08:10.250 --> 1:08:11.541
Let's get it done.

1:08:12.041 --> 1:08:13.166
Now,

1:08:14.833 --> 1:08:15.916
where were we?

1:08:26.875 --> 1:08:28.458
It's kind of cool.

1:08:33.250 --> 1:08:34.250
Huh.

1:08:36.875 --> 1:08:37.791
All right.

1:08:52.333 --> 1:08:53.791
This is super cool.

1:08:54.291 --> 1:08:56.333
Yeah, all right.

1:08:56.416 --> 1:08:58.041
You… you can put that down.

1:08:58.958 --> 1:09:00.041
Sorry.

1:09:00.125 --> 1:09:02.500
This is all just leftover
from when I was a kid.

1:09:02.583 --> 1:09:06.333
I was gonna get rid of all of this stuff.
I haven't really had the time to upgrade--

1:09:06.416 --> 1:09:08.416
Yes. Did you build all of this?

1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:12.666
Yeah, but you know,
can we just maybe turn this down--

1:09:12.750 --> 1:09:14.791
Mm-mm. No.

1:09:16.125 --> 1:09:17.291
Why not?

1:09:17.375 --> 1:09:18.458
'Cause I like it.

1:09:19.541 --> 1:09:20.833
I think it's really good.

1:09:21.500 --> 1:09:26.333
I mean, I'm assuming
B's Session Number Three, that's you?

1:09:26.958 --> 1:09:30.250
Oh yeah. You know,
this is actually… it's a… it's a classic.

1:09:30.333 --> 1:09:31.458
Oh, this is a classic?

1:09:31.541 --> 1:09:33.375
Oh yeah, yeah. Everyone says so.

1:09:33.458 --> 1:09:35.041
-Oh, everyone says so?
-Mm-hmm.

1:09:35.125 --> 1:09:36.500
People, like who?

1:09:37.208 --> 1:09:40.125
You know, people like… my grandma?

1:09:40.208 --> 1:09:42.458
-Yeah.

1:09:42.541 --> 1:09:45.500
So, when are you gonna play this
for other people?

1:09:46.291 --> 1:09:50.833
Well, I'm planning on it. I… I want
to do something… something with this.

1:09:50.916 --> 1:09:53.791
It's more than fun.
I wanna turn it into something real.

1:09:55.291 --> 1:09:56.458
And when I do, you know,

1:09:56.541 --> 1:09:59.875
then you could tell people
that you're my first fan.

1:09:59.958 --> 1:10:02.458
-So, in a way, you're welcome.
-Oh, I can?

1:10:02.541 --> 1:10:04.500
Yeah, you know, if you want.

1:10:04.583 --> 1:10:06.583
Well, I mean, for what it's worth,

1:10:07.333 --> 1:10:10.041
I believe you. It's really good.

1:10:10.541 --> 1:10:12.041
You're really talented.

1:10:12.541 --> 1:10:14.458
And you're a very good driver.

1:10:14.541 --> 1:10:16.666
-Thanks.
-Mmm.

1:10:18.875 --> 1:10:20.750
Well, what… what about you?

1:10:22.041 --> 1:10:23.125
What about me?

1:10:23.208 --> 1:10:26.791
You know, is there anything that you like?
Anything you're passionate about?

1:10:28.125 --> 1:10:31.500
I mean, like, in a past life.

1:10:33.458 --> 1:10:36.708
Zoé and I are always talking
about, like, the shit we're gonna do.

1:10:36.791 --> 1:10:39.250
-You know?
-When did you two meet?

1:10:39.333 --> 1:10:41.291
Um…

1:10:41.375 --> 1:10:44.875
She had this place
in Laurel Canyon in the '70s,

1:10:44.958 --> 1:10:46.708
and she would throw these parties.

1:10:46.791 --> 1:10:49.125
So, they would go
for like three or four days.

1:10:49.208 --> 1:10:51.291
Everyone was there. And she loved Bowie,

1:10:51.375 --> 1:10:54.083
so she had this, like…
the Bowie haircut, you know.

1:10:54.166 --> 1:10:56.375
She was cool, man.
The queen bitch, that was her.

1:10:56.458 --> 1:10:58.166
-Yeah, that checks out.

1:10:58.250 --> 1:11:02.791
And I was, like, just like a stray
when I first moved here,

1:11:02.875 --> 1:11:06.500
and I didn't feel like I fit anywhere.

1:11:07.250 --> 1:11:08.916
And it was like she saw me.

1:11:10.125 --> 1:11:14.125
She told me everything could be beautiful.

1:11:16.500 --> 1:11:18.166
She said a bunch of stuff.

1:11:19.416 --> 1:11:22.333
And then she turned me,

1:11:23.375 --> 1:11:25.000
and she gave me this life.

1:11:31.333 --> 1:11:34.041
Honestly, you should take this
to a producer.

1:11:34.125 --> 1:11:36.125
-Yeah.
-You could make real money.

1:11:36.208 --> 1:11:39.333
I know, I know, it's just
I don't think it's where it has to be yet.

1:11:39.416 --> 1:11:41.166
Where does it have to be?
What's it missing?

1:11:41.250 --> 1:11:43.458
It's missing a little something
before it becomes like a--

1:11:43.541 --> 1:11:45.250
-Like, what? A classic?
-Yeah.

1:11:45.333 --> 1:11:46.750
-Mmm.
-Yeah, a classic.

1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.041
We need to leave.

1:11:55.916 --> 1:11:57.416
Yeah. Cool.

1:12:01.791 --> 1:12:02.625
Hi.

1:12:03.750 --> 1:12:06.583
We're done with Benny, right?
He can stay here.

1:12:06.666 --> 1:12:07.833
I don't think so.

1:12:08.958 --> 1:12:12.583
-Well, this has nothing to do with him.
-He's coming. That's how it's gotta be.

1:12:14.083 --> 1:12:15.500
Why are you being like this?

1:12:17.333 --> 1:12:19.875
Do you want to be the one to tell Victor?

1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:25.000
Hey.

1:12:26.208 --> 1:12:27.416
I'm coming with you.

1:12:28.791 --> 1:12:29.708
Good.

1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:32.000
Let's go.

1:12:35.083 --> 1:12:36.875
Anything happens to me,

1:12:37.875 --> 1:12:39.250
you take care of Benny.

1:12:40.625 --> 1:12:41.958
You protect him.

1:12:43.083 --> 1:12:44.333
Consider it done.

1:13:01.041 --> 1:13:01.958
Where's Benny?

1:13:03.708 --> 1:13:07.416
-Jay. So glad you could make it.

1:13:07.500 --> 1:13:09.833
You put a hand on him or Maria,
I swear to God--

1:13:09.916 --> 1:13:12.833
Is that her name? We'll get to her.

1:13:13.375 --> 1:13:14.875
But first, sit.

1:13:14.958 --> 1:13:16.875
-Where are they?
-Sit.

1:13:23.125 --> 1:13:24.916
It's funny to think, though.

1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:26.958
Almost a hundred years ago,

1:13:27.833 --> 1:13:30.875
my kind sat across from your kind,

1:13:30.958 --> 1:13:32.916
much like you and I right now.

1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.458
And then they came up with that truce.

1:13:36.083 --> 1:13:38.291
Well, you broke that truce.

1:13:38.791 --> 1:13:41.000
You took people from my neighborhood.

1:13:41.666 --> 1:13:42.750
Innocent people.

1:13:43.458 --> 1:13:45.541
Did you think we were gonna let
you get away with that?

1:13:45.625 --> 1:13:49.333
We? Who's this "we" you're talking about?

1:13:50.083 --> 1:13:53.333
Everyone's gone. I had them all killed.

1:13:54.291 --> 1:13:58.416
You should have taken my offer.
Now it's all going to be mine.

1:13:59.500 --> 1:14:02.166
You see, you're the last piece.

1:14:03.291 --> 1:14:07.458
Once you're gone,
this city's just one fat neck

1:14:08.458 --> 1:14:09.958
waiting to get sucked.

1:14:10.916 --> 1:14:11.875
You want me?

1:14:13.500 --> 1:14:15.250
Fine. Fair game.

1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.375
Maria and Benny
have nothing to do with this.

1:14:19.416 --> 1:14:20.458
Let them go.

1:14:21.791 --> 1:14:25.458
That's not how this is going to go.
Nobody walks.

1:14:26.750 --> 1:14:27.791
You know that.

1:14:33.458 --> 1:14:37.000
-How do I look? Do I look okay?

1:14:40.291 --> 1:14:41.916
-Do you want some?

1:14:42.500 --> 1:14:43.791
I saved her for you.

1:14:44.416 --> 1:14:45.708
Your sweet Maria.

1:14:45.791 --> 1:14:46.625
What?

1:14:47.250 --> 1:14:48.958
I saved her for you, Jay.

1:14:50.125 --> 1:14:52.916
-No. No.

1:14:53.583 --> 1:14:55.583
Don't go soft on me now.

1:14:56.291 --> 1:14:58.375
We haven't even gotten started yet.

1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:23.208
Last kill.

1:15:25.875 --> 1:15:27.083
Let's do this.

1:15:42.500 --> 1:15:44.958
Maybe lean close. This guy's a freak.

1:15:49.458 --> 1:15:51.125
Look what the night dragged in.

1:15:51.916 --> 1:15:53.583
Couple of strays.

1:15:53.666 --> 1:15:56.125
Good morning, Rocko.

1:15:57.083 --> 1:15:58.708
No such thing as a good morning.

1:15:58.791 --> 1:16:00.250
Mmm, maybe not for you.

1:16:04.625 --> 1:16:06.000
I don't know you, do I?

1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:08.708
No, but I'm… I'm with them.

1:16:08.791 --> 1:16:12.000
That doesn't really change
your problem, amigo.

1:16:14.916 --> 1:16:17.875
-I don't know you.
-Don't worry about him. He's cool.

1:16:17.958 --> 1:16:19.291
Yeah, chill, he's with us.

1:16:21.166 --> 1:16:22.125
You cool?

1:16:27.250 --> 1:16:28.291
Cool, dude.

1:16:29.416 --> 1:16:30.416
Rough night?

1:16:32.625 --> 1:16:36.166
You look a little, uh, banged up, bro.

1:16:38.166 --> 1:16:40.166
Yeah, I'm… I'm a little banged up, bro.

1:16:49.625 --> 1:16:52.875
Oh, I'm just messing with you, man!
I'm goofing!

1:16:52.958 --> 1:16:55.250
Mi casa es su casa!

1:16:56.125 --> 1:16:57.708
Enter at your leisure.

1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:00.083
-Madam.
-Mmm.

1:17:16.041 --> 1:17:18.041
Oh, you smell nice.

1:17:19.041 --> 1:17:21.333
You give good blood, don't you?

1:17:22.208 --> 1:17:23.250
I can tell.

1:17:24.458 --> 1:17:26.458
I have a nose for these things.

1:17:28.416 --> 1:17:30.000
I see things, man.

1:17:31.208 --> 1:17:32.291
Visions.

1:17:33.750 --> 1:17:37.958
Some people say
I'm like a… like a psychic or something.

1:17:38.041 --> 1:17:40.791
-Yeah, I… I bet they do say that.
-They do.

1:17:43.041 --> 1:17:44.041
Rocko.

1:17:44.583 --> 1:17:45.583
Yes?

1:17:46.083 --> 1:17:47.208
Not this one.

1:17:49.625 --> 1:17:53.041
Oh, whatever, man.
I'm not into virgins. You know that.

1:17:54.208 --> 1:17:57.166
-I'm… I'm not even a--
-Hey. Don't lie, man.

1:17:58.500 --> 1:18:00.041
Third eye sees all.

1:18:06.041 --> 1:18:07.333
This is weird.

1:18:08.625 --> 1:18:11.833
You guys didn't call.
You showed up unannounced.

1:18:13.708 --> 1:18:16.333
Is this like a booty call or something?

1:18:16.416 --> 1:18:18.125
I'm not that kind of girl.

1:18:18.791 --> 1:18:21.375
We just wanted
to surprise you, Rocko.

1:18:22.250 --> 1:18:25.000
What, you don't like surprises anymore?

1:18:26.500 --> 1:18:28.541
You know I love surprises.

1:18:29.666 --> 1:18:31.375
Surprises are tight.

1:18:34.750 --> 1:18:37.083
Do you want to leave us for a minute?

1:18:37.958 --> 1:18:39.250
-Yeah.

1:18:39.333 --> 1:18:41.083
Yeah, why don't you guys, uh,

1:18:41.750 --> 1:18:44.958
leave us to it for the minute
and go out to the pool?

1:18:45.041 --> 1:18:48.708
Let the grown-ups, uh, conversate.

1:18:54.250 --> 1:18:55.666
We'll be out there soon.

1:18:58.166 --> 1:18:59.791
-Bye, virgin.

1:19:03.250 --> 1:19:04.083
Drink?

1:19:12.041 --> 1:19:13.041
What?

1:19:15.375 --> 1:19:17.958
I don't know how you could be
so chill about all this.

1:19:18.041 --> 1:19:19.416
You know? It's like,

1:19:20.041 --> 1:19:23.791
you're out here every night
doing this Kill Bill-type shit.

1:19:23.875 --> 1:19:25.125
-It's crazy.

1:19:25.208 --> 1:19:28.041
-It's kind of… it's kind of crazy.
-It's not every night.

1:19:28.625 --> 1:19:29.750
-It's not?
-No.

1:19:31.458 --> 1:19:34.416
If I'm still alive tomorrow,
I am sleeping all day.

1:19:36.333 --> 1:19:37.458
-Mmm.
-Sounds nice.

1:19:37.541 --> 1:19:38.500
Mmm.

1:19:39.666 --> 1:19:40.583
It is.

1:19:46.666 --> 1:19:47.625
What's it like?

1:19:48.291 --> 1:19:49.291
Hmm?

1:19:50.791 --> 1:19:51.791
You know.

1:19:55.625 --> 1:19:56.625
Honestly…

1:19:59.750 --> 1:20:01.416
sometimes it feels awesome.

1:20:02.208 --> 1:20:03.500
You can do whatever you want.

1:20:04.500 --> 1:20:06.041
You don't have to hold back.

1:20:06.541 --> 1:20:08.208
You're completely free.

1:20:10.916 --> 1:20:11.958
Sometimes.

1:20:14.041 --> 1:20:16.208
I just killed this dude an hour ago.

1:20:16.791 --> 1:20:17.916
Mm-hmm.

1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:19.291
Fresh type O.

1:20:21.791 --> 1:20:22.833
Clean blood.

1:20:26.416 --> 1:20:27.250
Can't beat it.

1:20:30.833 --> 1:20:31.958
Cheers.

1:20:39.625 --> 1:20:40.541
So,

1:20:42.041 --> 1:20:44.375
what's with the late-night hang?

1:20:45.916 --> 1:20:48.083
You girls never cross the 405.

1:20:48.166 --> 1:20:50.791
We were in the neighborhood.
Figured we'd stop by.

1:20:52.125 --> 1:20:53.166
Knew you'd be up late.

1:21:14.250 --> 1:21:15.500
So, you got any family?

1:21:17.375 --> 1:21:18.458
I got Zoé.

1:21:19.416 --> 1:21:20.375
She's got me.

1:21:20.875 --> 1:21:21.875
No, but like…

1:21:23.708 --> 1:21:24.916
like real family.

1:21:31.416 --> 1:21:32.625
You know, my, uh…

1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:38.583
my grandma scooped me up
after my mom passed,

1:21:38.666 --> 1:21:41.500
and it was me, and it was her,

1:21:42.208 --> 1:21:43.250
and it was Jay.

1:21:43.750 --> 1:21:45.083
And Jay, he… he…

1:21:47.708 --> 1:21:49.041
he took care of me.

1:21:50.041 --> 1:21:51.750
He… he didn't have to.

1:21:52.791 --> 1:21:54.916
You know, he's… he's just my half brother,

1:21:55.750 --> 1:21:59.041
but he's… he's like
the only father I've ever had.

1:22:00.416 --> 1:22:01.375
I'm sorry.

1:22:05.625 --> 1:22:08.541
You're not like her, you know? Like Zoé.

1:22:11.708 --> 1:22:13.375
I mean, I… I see you, you're…

1:22:14.708 --> 1:22:15.916
you're alive.

1:22:27.916 --> 1:22:29.208
Can I ask you something?

1:22:32.458 --> 1:22:33.625
Are you gonna kill me?

1:22:39.625 --> 1:22:40.583
No.

1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:45.416
I don't want you like that.

1:23:09.333 --> 1:23:11.916
So how come
you never come to visit anymore?

1:23:12.791 --> 1:23:15.625
-We had a good thing going back then.

1:23:19.708 --> 1:23:20.875
Reagan was president.

1:23:21.458 --> 1:23:23.125
Shit, it was that long ago?

1:23:23.208 --> 1:23:25.125
-Mm-hmm.
-Wow.

1:23:28.875 --> 1:23:30.083
Time flies.

1:23:34.333 --> 1:23:35.166
What?

1:23:39.250 --> 1:23:40.083
What?

1:23:41.666 --> 1:23:43.041
Is something wrong?

1:23:43.125 --> 1:23:46.333
No. No. Nothing wrong.

1:23:48.208 --> 1:23:51.333
Oh, it just hit me.
Maybe just this one thing.

1:23:52.791 --> 1:23:54.625
The part where you and Victor

1:23:54.708 --> 1:23:57.333
decide to kill and steal
from your own blood.

1:23:58.083 --> 1:24:00.375
-You wicked bitch.

1:24:00.458 --> 1:24:01.708
Oh, you bloodsucker.

1:24:10.500 --> 1:24:11.333
What?

1:24:12.500 --> 1:24:14.666
-I have to tell you something.
-What happened?

1:24:15.333 --> 1:24:17.583
Your brother. Victor has him.

1:24:24.125 --> 1:24:25.166
Benny, get the car.

1:24:51.666 --> 1:24:52.583
Tango down!

1:25:37.458 --> 1:25:38.625
Drive! Drive!

1:25:57.125 --> 1:25:59.208
Babe, you're okay. We did it.

1:25:59.291 --> 1:26:01.625
-I'm sorry.

1:26:02.916 --> 1:26:04.166
The night's over.

1:26:05.166 --> 1:26:07.166
We'll go home, and you'll be okay.

1:26:08.166 --> 1:26:09.500
Benny, she needs blood.

1:26:13.125 --> 1:26:14.041
Oh God.

1:26:14.625 --> 1:26:16.500
We have to get to the last stop.

1:26:17.333 --> 1:26:19.333
Okay. Okay.

1:26:46.916 --> 1:26:50.125
-Okay, let's get her inside.
-No. Hey, you take the car and run.

1:26:50.208 --> 1:26:52.375
-Okay?
-What are you talking about?

1:26:52.458 --> 1:26:53.833
This is Victor's house.

1:26:55.291 --> 1:26:57.708
Okay, and he has Jay,
so I'm not going anywhere.

1:26:57.791 --> 1:27:00.958
I'm sorry. Okay?
I'm sorry, I am. But it's too late.

1:27:01.041 --> 1:27:05.166
No, it's not too late. If there's a chance
that he's in there, then I'm going in!

1:27:05.250 --> 1:27:08.250
You're dead the second you go in there.
Don't you understand?

1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:10.458
Not if you help me.

1:27:13.916 --> 1:27:14.750
It's over.

1:27:16.083 --> 1:27:17.208
Promise me.

1:27:18.291 --> 1:27:21.125
-Okay. Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

1:27:21.208 --> 1:27:23.833
You're good.
All right. Ready? Ready?

1:27:24.666 --> 1:27:25.750
Okay. Come on.

1:28:56.666 --> 1:28:57.541
Jay.

1:28:59.750 --> 1:29:00.791
Jay.

1:29:01.833 --> 1:29:02.708
Jay.

1:29:02.791 --> 1:29:03.708
Hey, Jay.

1:29:03.791 --> 1:29:07.250
Hey. Hey, yo, Jay.
Hey, it's me. It's Benny, hey.

1:29:10.125 --> 1:29:12.208
You see me? Hey.

1:29:12.833 --> 1:29:14.708
I'mma get you out.

1:29:14.791 --> 1:29:16.291
I'mma… I'mma…

1:29:18.291 --> 1:29:20.708
I'mma get you out of here.
I'mma get you out.

1:29:30.083 --> 1:29:32.500
Look who's decided to join us.

1:29:32.583 --> 1:29:33.958
Benny.

1:29:34.041 --> 1:29:38.083
Did you miss us? You missed us.

1:29:38.166 --> 1:29:39.750
I'm sensing some tension here.

1:29:40.708 --> 1:29:42.958
Yeah, Benny's had a busy night.

1:29:43.041 --> 1:29:47.041
I've heard so much about you.
Why don't you join us? Take a seat.

1:29:47.125 --> 1:29:49.291
-I'd rather stand.
-Oh.

1:29:49.375 --> 1:29:52.333
So, tell us, Benny.
What are you doing here?

1:29:52.416 --> 1:29:53.875
I'd like to make a deal.

1:29:54.541 --> 1:29:57.625
Let Jay go. Take me instead.

1:29:59.416 --> 1:30:01.041
It's an interesting proposal.

1:30:01.125 --> 1:30:03.083
Benny.

1:30:03.791 --> 1:30:04.625
Hey, Blaire.

1:30:05.750 --> 1:30:06.875
What's wrong?

1:30:06.958 --> 1:30:08.291
I didn't say anything.

1:30:08.375 --> 1:30:10.583
Benny, have you ever tried fresh blood?

1:30:11.541 --> 1:30:13.458
There's nothing like it.

1:30:16.208 --> 1:30:18.125
I remember when I first came here.

1:30:19.500 --> 1:30:20.958
The blood tastes different.

1:30:22.541 --> 1:30:24.291
I had to get used to it.

1:30:25.958 --> 1:30:27.750
I had to develop my palate.

1:30:29.250 --> 1:30:30.500
Now I can't get enough.

1:30:35.958 --> 1:30:38.833
After considering your proposal,
unfortunately,

1:30:38.916 --> 1:30:40.416
I'm going to have to decline.

1:30:41.708 --> 1:30:43.625
-But here's my counteroffer.

1:30:44.166 --> 1:30:46.750
Because I run things now,

1:30:46.833 --> 1:30:48.541
you will be our appetizer.

1:30:50.333 --> 1:30:55.083
Jay will be our main course.
And I think I'll save abuela for dessert.

1:30:57.083 --> 1:31:00.625
Hey! Don't you fucking touch him!
What are you doing? He saved us tonight.

1:31:00.708 --> 1:31:02.750
Well, then I guess
we'll make it quick, then.

1:31:02.833 --> 1:31:05.375
Hold him down. It's time to drink.

1:31:07.500 --> 1:31:09.750
-Don't.
-Oh. This is interesting.

1:31:09.833 --> 1:31:11.000
She's just confused.

1:31:11.083 --> 1:31:13.500
-You're not confused, are you?
-Not at all, actually.

1:31:13.583 --> 1:31:14.583
Hey.

1:31:15.208 --> 1:31:16.916
Everything's okay. What's going on?

1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:18.708
-We won! We won!
-We won?

1:31:18.791 --> 1:31:20.416
Blaire, stop. You don't gotta do this.

1:31:20.500 --> 1:31:23.666
-I'll tell you when you can talk!
-I don't work for you anymore.

1:31:24.250 --> 1:31:26.500
So I'm not gonna listen
to any more of your crazy bullshit.

1:31:26.583 --> 1:31:29.250
You're gonna let him
talk to us like that, Blaire?

1:31:30.500 --> 1:31:31.375
I can't do this.

1:31:31.458 --> 1:31:35.416
No, no, no, no!
Everything is finally good.

1:31:35.500 --> 1:31:38.916
-We're finally good.
-I'm telling you, I'm done.

1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:40.791
Hey! I need you.

1:31:41.375 --> 1:31:46.166
I can't do this without you.
I don't want to do this without you.

1:31:46.250 --> 1:31:48.500
-I want out. Oh!
-No, Blaire, no!

1:31:48.583 --> 1:31:50.125
You were nothing!

1:31:50.208 --> 1:31:53.041
I made you! I made you!

1:31:53.125 --> 1:31:54.791
You can't leave me.

1:31:55.291 --> 1:31:57.000
-You need me.
-Not anymore.

1:31:58.083 --> 1:31:59.208
-No!
-No!

1:32:05.250 --> 1:32:07.375
-Look at what you did, Benny.
-No!

1:32:07.458 --> 1:32:09.000
Look at what you did.

1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:15.333
She's had a weak heart.
Put her out of her misery.

1:32:15.416 --> 1:32:17.375
This was supposed to be our night.

1:32:18.125 --> 1:32:19.125
No.

1:32:20.875 --> 1:32:21.958
Night's over.

1:33:34.666 --> 1:33:35.500
Benny.

1:33:37.125 --> 1:33:38.250
Jay?

1:33:38.333 --> 1:33:39.916
-Hey. Jay.
-Run.

1:33:40.458 --> 1:33:43.208
-Jay. Where is he? Where is he?
-Run. Run. Now.

1:33:43.291 --> 1:33:45.708
It's a trap. Benny--

1:34:52.041 --> 1:34:54.916
Benny, you're okay. No, Benny. Benny.

1:34:55.541 --> 1:34:59.291
Hey. No. You're okay. You're okay.

1:35:04.416 --> 1:35:05.583
It's okay.

1:35:19.250 --> 1:35:20.125
Here.

1:37:17.708 --> 1:37:20.458
-I, uh, spoke to the depot.
-Right.

1:37:20.541 --> 1:37:22.958
"Jay, you can never ever drive
for the company again."

1:37:23.458 --> 1:37:26.791
-I told you not to scratch it, fool.
-I did a little more than a scratch it.

1:37:26.875 --> 1:37:29.458
-Yeah, you did, man. Yeah, you did.

1:37:29.541 --> 1:37:31.291
But, um, I wouldn't be here

1:37:31.375 --> 1:37:34.041
eating this fine slice of pizza
if it weren't for you.

1:37:35.333 --> 1:37:37.041
Well, you'd do the same for me so…

1:37:41.083 --> 1:37:43.083
Things are gonna be different, you know.

1:37:43.583 --> 1:37:45.208
The whole world's changed.

1:37:46.083 --> 1:37:48.166
And everyone's gonna have to take a side.

1:37:51.625 --> 1:37:54.666
Just don't forget where you came from.

1:37:56.125 --> 1:37:57.458
I know where home is.

1:38:06.083 --> 1:38:09.208
Oh, I, uh, left you a little something.

1:39:04.291 --> 1:39:06.750
Come on. Ask him what happened.

1:39:06.833 --> 1:39:07.666
Yo.

1:39:08.291 --> 1:39:09.333
Benny, man. Hold up.

1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:12.833
What's up?

1:39:12.916 --> 1:39:14.500
Where you been, man?

1:39:15.166 --> 1:39:17.250
We see you at the club,
and then you went MIA.

1:39:17.333 --> 1:39:18.958
Yeah. Um, Benny.

1:39:22.625 --> 1:39:23.458
Are you okay?

1:39:28.083 --> 1:39:29.208
Never been better.

1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.000
Hey.

1:39:32.875 --> 1:39:35.083
Get in. We're running late.

1:39:40.708 --> 1:39:42.958
Yeah, I gotta go,
but I'll see y'all later, yeah?

1:39:43.916 --> 1:39:44.958
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:39:56.625 --> 1:39:57.625
Y'all want a ride?
