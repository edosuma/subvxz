00:57.600 --> 01:00.637
Good morning, Mr. Basset.
This is your wake-up call.

01:01.271 --> 01:02.980
Please move your ass.

01:17.876 --> 01:18.991
Stampede!

01:20.004 --> 01:22.543
Stampede, Earl! Get out of the way!

01:27.472 --> 01:29.181
You dumb shit.

01:31.561 --> 01:33.269
l was in a stampede once.

01:34.690 --> 01:37.608
300 head going hell-bent for the horizon.

01:38.403 --> 01:42.069
Exactly how many cows
are required for a stampede, Earl?

01:42.617 --> 01:45.535
l mean, is it like three or more?
ls there a minimum speed?

01:46.038 --> 01:48.031
l wish a stampede up your ass.

02:20.749 --> 02:21.864
No breakfast?

02:22.502 --> 02:25.338
l did it yesterday.
lt was bologna and beans.

02:26.799 --> 02:29.884
No. lt was eggs. l did eggs...

02:30.429 --> 02:31.460
...over easy.

02:31.555 --> 02:35.388
The hell you did.
Bologna and beans. lt's your turn.

02:44.948 --> 02:46.691
l guess when l'm your age...

02:46.950 --> 02:48.742
...l'll forget what l eat, too.

02:55.336 --> 02:56.747
Goddamn it!

02:57.756 --> 03:00.426
l ask you, is this a job for intelligent men?

03:00.509 --> 03:02.253
Show me one. l'll ask him.

03:03.555 --> 03:06.557
lf we were serious about money,
we'd quit being hired hands.

03:06.642 --> 03:09.893
Handymen, Earl. We are handymen.

03:10.230 --> 03:12.223
We should quit this job...

03:12.316 --> 03:14.559
...and find ourselves
some real employment.

03:14.653 --> 03:17.323
Are you going to give up
all this personal freedom?

03:17.406 --> 03:18.652
l don't know.

03:32.843 --> 03:33.874
Freeway!

03:34.846 --> 03:36.673
What's on the agenda for today?

03:36.765 --> 03:40.135
-lt's garbage day.
-Man! Already?

03:40.728 --> 03:42.437
What's Nestor paying us?

03:43.482 --> 03:46.649
$50. And that's $47 more than we got.

03:47.362 --> 03:50.696
Burt and Heather's place is closer.
Let's do their linoleum today...

03:50.783 --> 03:52.361
...and the garbage tomorrow.

03:52.452 --> 03:55.619
Nestor's not home tomorrow.
We don't dig today, we're not paid.

03:55.748 --> 03:58.074
Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.

03:58.418 --> 04:00.910
You never take the long view.
Here it is Monday...

04:01.004 --> 04:03.247
...and l'm already thinking of Wednesday.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.629
lt is Monday, right?

04:09.515 --> 04:12.351
Who the hell's that?
That's not the grad student?

04:12.436 --> 04:15.604
-No. He graduated. Must be the new one.
-The new one?

04:17.401 --> 04:19.144
That's supposed to be a girl.

04:27.038 --> 04:29.744
You will have long, blonde hair...

04:29.959 --> 04:32.747
...big green eyes, world-class breasts...

04:33.088 --> 04:37.466
...ass that won't quit
and legs that go all the way up!

04:46.730 --> 04:51.275
Hi! l'm Rhonda LeBeck.
l'm up here for the semester.

04:51.487 --> 04:53.812
-Yeah, geography.
-Geology.

04:54.365 --> 04:57.403
Well, actually seismology. Earthquakes.

04:57.995 --> 04:59.703
You two must be Val and Earl.

04:59.956 --> 05:02.578
-l've heard all about you.
-We deny everything.

05:04.837 --> 05:06.546
l've got a question for you.

05:06.631 --> 05:09.668
Do you know if anybody's
doing any drilling or blasting...

05:09.760 --> 05:11.421
...or anything like that?

05:12.556 --> 05:15.094
Around here? No, ma'am.

05:16.394 --> 05:19.146
l'm supposed to monitor the seismographs.

05:20.107 --> 05:22.266
You know, they measure vibrations.

05:22.819 --> 05:24.444
Vibrations in the ground.

05:24.947 --> 05:25.812
Yeah.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.952
l've been getting
some really strange readings.

05:30.078 --> 05:34.160
The school's had the machines here, and
we've never recorded anything like this.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.786
We'll ask around.
See if anyone's heard anything.

05:38.881 --> 05:39.877
Thanks.

05:40.342 --> 05:44.008
God, l hope they're not broken.
l might have to bag the whole semester.

05:44.847 --> 05:46.888
Anyway, sorry to bother you.

05:47.392 --> 05:48.555
No problem.

05:49.103 --> 05:51.642
Nice meeting you.
Hope you get it all sorted out.

06:07.377 --> 06:10.331
lf you wanted,
we could take a look at those...

06:11.841 --> 06:13.798
...seismographs for her if you want.

06:13.885 --> 06:16.293
What the hell do we know
about seismographs?

06:16.555 --> 06:17.587
Nothing.

06:18.057 --> 06:20.727
-lt might be a slick way to get to know her.
-Why?

06:21.895 --> 06:23.307
Damn it, Valentine.

06:23.523 --> 06:27.189
You don't go for any gal
unless she fits your list, top to bottom.

06:27.277 --> 06:29.769
-Well sure!
-lt's dumber than my hind end.

06:29.864 --> 06:31.323
l mean, like that...

06:31.950 --> 06:33.694
...Bobby Lynn Dexter.

06:33.953 --> 06:35.495
Tammy Lynn Baxter.

06:35.997 --> 06:38.703
lt don't matter.
They're all the same: dead weight.

06:39.251 --> 06:40.960
''Oh, l broke a nail!''

06:42.380 --> 06:43.756
Makes my skin crawl.

06:44.174 --> 06:46.713
l'm a victim of circumstance.

06:48.555 --> 06:50.347
l thought you call it your pecker.

07:22.891 --> 07:24.137
Pizza-face!

07:25.019 --> 07:26.098
Melvin.

07:26.312 --> 07:29.065
You touch that truck and die.

07:30.610 --> 07:32.686
Man, l'm really shaking.

07:35.616 --> 07:36.648
Thanks, Walter.

07:36.784 --> 07:39.988
These are hollow points,
but not hydro-shock hollow points.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.916
-Bullets are bullets.
-Hi, guys. What's happening?

07:43.001 --> 07:45.623
We ran into that new college student,
that Rona.

07:45.963 --> 07:49.249
Rhonda. She's having trouble with her...

07:51.053 --> 07:52.002
...things.

07:52.555 --> 07:56.885
Those college kids turn up
oil or uranium or something out there...

07:57.311 --> 08:03.018
...next thing the Feds will be at our door.
''Sorry. Time to move. Eminent domain.''

08:03.235 --> 08:04.611
Down, honey. Down.

08:04.695 --> 08:06.854
Yeah, Burt. The way you worry...

08:06.948 --> 08:10.864
...you'll get a heart attack before
you get a chance to survive World War lll.

08:10.954 --> 08:12.116
We'll see.

08:15.835 --> 08:19.252
Guys, listen. Bearing going out.
What do you think?

08:19.631 --> 08:22.717
-Could be.
-Later, Chang. We got a schedule to keep.

08:22.802 --> 08:27.097
Yeah. See, we plan ahead.
That way we don't do anything right now.

08:27.183 --> 08:28.381
Earl explained it to me.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.149
Cocktail?

10:18.953 --> 10:20.068
You bet.

10:26.045 --> 10:27.244
l'll tell you.

10:27.923 --> 10:30.046
Nobody handles garbage
better than we do.

10:34.223 --> 10:37.474
Come on, Earl. This is low.

10:38.019 --> 10:40.891
We have got to set our sights
a little bit higher.

10:46.196 --> 10:50.112
Melvin, why don't you give us a hand?
Most of this shit is yours anyway.

10:50.911 --> 10:54.779
Listen, run to the store
and pick me up a six-pack. l'll pay for it.

10:54.916 --> 10:57.289
Son, beer is for adults.

10:59.839 --> 11:02.757
Not having a plan
is what keeps us doing jobs like this.

11:02.968 --> 11:06.005
Just doing jobs like this
is you dragging your feet.

11:06.389 --> 11:10.768
Are you going to stand there and tell me
l'm the reason we're still in Perfection?

11:10.853 --> 11:13.606
You know how close l am
to leaving this place right now?

11:13.690 --> 11:16.265
l'll call that little bluff. How close?

11:17.988 --> 11:20.314
-Shit!
-Goddamn!

11:21.409 --> 11:25.110
Jesus Christ! Goddamn!

11:27.709 --> 11:29.203
Don't forget the TV.

11:29.586 --> 11:32.623
-Why you bringing the vacuum cleaner?
-l like it.

11:32.715 --> 11:35.337
-You never use it.
-lt's good for parts.

11:37.805 --> 11:41.009
Besides, maybe we'll hire a maid.
You think about that?

11:41.101 --> 11:42.512
Get in the truck.

11:51.531 --> 11:52.646
Guys!

11:55.161 --> 11:56.869
Guys, wait!

12:01.628 --> 12:04.416
Sorry, Nancy.
We're not delivering firewood anymore.

12:04.715 --> 12:07.289
-We're heading for Bixby permanent.
-Sure.

12:08.637 --> 12:10.594
Oh, my God. You really are!

12:12.141 --> 12:14.763
Mindy, what's the count?

12:14.853 --> 12:16.597
640.

12:17.106 --> 12:21.983
l don't need firewood. l have this big order
to fill and have to build my pottery kiln.

12:22.697 --> 12:24.986
Come on, it'll be at least a month's work.

12:26.034 --> 12:27.577
l'll throw in lunches.

12:28.788 --> 12:30.117
And beer.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.956
l can't believe we said no to free beer.

12:40.052 --> 12:43.553
We did it! We faced temptation
and did not bend!

12:43.640 --> 12:45.432
Goddamn! Praise the Lord!

12:46.394 --> 12:50.262
Now there's nothing, and l mean nothing,
between us and Bixby.

12:56.282 --> 12:57.527
Look at that guy!

12:57.659 --> 13:00.696
That's one job l'd never do.
Working around electricity.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.788
Hold up.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.744
That's Edgar Deems.

13:05.627 --> 13:06.576
Come on.

13:06.962 --> 13:09.335
He only wears that one damn jacket.

13:09.674 --> 13:11.584
That's him, l'm telling you.

13:25.361 --> 13:27.734
He sure must've been drunk this time.

13:28.073 --> 13:30.113
Get your butt down from there!

13:37.043 --> 13:38.870
Shit.

13:39.296 --> 13:41.206
We can't leave him up there.

13:50.936 --> 13:52.347
Thank you, Edgar.

13:55.525 --> 13:58.444
You owe me on this one,
you damned old boozehound.

14:05.747 --> 14:09.615
One of these days, you'll have
to get your ass on a wagon and stay there.

14:09.835 --> 14:13.252
lt's not like l don't have
better things to do than climb towers...

14:13.549 --> 14:15.957
...and drag your hairy ass down.

14:18.013 --> 14:19.211
Jesus!

14:26.941 --> 14:28.566
Was it a heart attack, doctor?

14:30.779 --> 14:31.645
No.

14:32.824 --> 14:35.315
He died of dehydration. Thirst.

14:35.994 --> 14:39.495
That doesn't make any sense.
That takes a couple of days, doesn't it?

14:39.582 --> 14:41.160
Maybe even three or four.

14:42.920 --> 14:45.127
You mean he sat up there
three or four days?

14:45.215 --> 14:47.541
He sat up there and just died of thirst?

15:58.852 --> 16:01.474
You reckon he hated Perfection
more than us?

16:02.815 --> 16:06.814
-Do you suppose he wanted to kill himself?
-Somebody must've chased him up there.

16:07.363 --> 16:10.400
You mean someone that ain't scared
of a Winchester rifle?

16:11.577 --> 16:15.658
Then what'd they do?
Camp out and wait for him to die?

16:17.876 --> 16:19.122
What the hell?

16:34.606 --> 16:36.814
What the shit?

16:38.987 --> 16:40.233
Fred!

17:02.726 --> 17:05.561
-This is weird.
-This is real weird.

17:09.944 --> 17:12.103
-Jesus!
-What the hell's going on?

17:12.823 --> 17:14.982
l mean, what the hell is going on?

17:24.755 --> 17:27.590
Get the hell out of here!
There's a killer on the loose!

17:28.092 --> 17:30.465
-What?
-A murderer, man! A real psycho!

17:30.763 --> 17:33.433
He's cutting people's heads off.
l'm not kidding!

17:34.726 --> 17:36.600
They're pulling our chain.

17:38.815 --> 17:39.728
Yeah.

17:58.215 --> 17:59.211
What?

18:06.893 --> 18:08.056
Howard!

18:11.566 --> 18:12.597
Carmine?

18:21.787 --> 18:23.246
Who could be doing it?

18:23.414 --> 18:27.544
l'm not accusing anybody,
but some of my cattle are missing.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.870
Are you serious? Old Fred's dead?

18:30.882 --> 18:33.588
-You're bullshitting me.
-What happened to Fred?

18:33.678 --> 18:34.876
Worse than Edgar.

18:34.971 --> 18:37.213
-What happened to him?
-You won't believe it.

18:37.307 --> 18:40.808
-l need a candy bar.
-l don't believe this. The phone's dead.

18:40.895 --> 18:43.352
-Walter, your phone is dead!
-l didn't do it.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.184
Nestor, what's happening?

18:45.526 --> 18:48.777
-Somebody killed old Fred.
-What's going on?

18:48.989 --> 18:54.198
Val, you've got to get to Bixby,
and get the police up here. And step on it.

18:56.082 --> 18:57.873
Consider it stepped on.

19:04.593 --> 19:08.722
We decided to leave this place
one damn day too late, you know?

19:09.557 --> 19:12.345
There's sure as hell
nothing to stop us now.

19:13.229 --> 19:16.100
Everybody we know between here
and Bixby is already dead.

19:16.191 --> 19:17.520
Look out!

19:23.033 --> 19:25.359
ls there some higher force at work here?

19:27.497 --> 19:29.621
l mean, are we asking too much of life?

19:29.750 --> 19:31.743
Where the hell are these guys?

19:32.629 --> 19:34.622
What are they doing? Blasting?

19:37.093 --> 19:40.629
Where are you guys?
lt's not like there's another road, assholes!

20:10.386 --> 20:13.092
-Jesus! l don't believe this!
-You're hung up.

20:14.767 --> 20:15.930
l am not!

20:19.273 --> 20:21.100
You're hung up, l tell you!

20:21.818 --> 20:23.775
You're going to burn the clutch!

20:33.833 --> 20:37.417
-You could break an axle like that.
-Could you shut up?

20:38.297 --> 20:40.623
l don't need to spend the night out here.

20:44.848 --> 20:45.963
Crybaby.

20:47.226 --> 20:48.601
-Could it have been coyotes?
-No way.

20:48.686 --> 20:50.513
Coyotes didn't kill Fred.

20:51.773 --> 20:53.932
lt's Val and Earl.

20:54.318 --> 20:56.146
They shouldn't be here already.

20:58.240 --> 21:01.610
-Thought you two were in Bixby by now.
-You're won't believe this.

21:01.703 --> 21:03.910
-Mom!
-Oh, my God!

21:08.962 --> 21:11.205
-Burt, be careful.
-Unreal.

21:11.924 --> 21:14.796
-Where'd you get it?
-l didn't know we had it.

21:15.012 --> 21:17.338
-lt's disgusting.
-Some kind of snake?

21:17.473 --> 21:21.852
-lt's more like an eel to me.
-Eels live in the water, don't they?

21:22.521 --> 21:25.096
-Big mother slug, maybe.
-Don't touch!

21:25.275 --> 21:27.767
Relax. lt's dead.

21:44.633 --> 21:46.176
lt must've grabbed us!

21:46.261 --> 21:49.049
-That's why the truck stalled.
-l said l wasn't hung up.

21:49.139 --> 21:50.800
This stalled out your truck?

21:52.519 --> 21:54.761
lt'd have to be one strong son of a bitch.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.186
Stinks, too.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.191
l'll give you boys $5 for this.

22:02.448 --> 22:03.444
$20.

22:03.867 --> 22:05.907
-Okay, $10!
-$15.

22:07.747 --> 22:10.618
-Okay, $15.
-Damn right, $15.

22:10.959 --> 22:12.537
l don't believe you guys.

22:14.047 --> 22:15.625
Could be a snake!

22:17.217 --> 22:18.842
Some kind of mutation.

22:24.101 --> 22:25.512
Whatever it is...

22:27.314 --> 22:30.850
...just one of these couldn't eat up Fred
and his whole flock of sheep.

22:31.152 --> 22:33.395
You think there are more out there?

22:47.673 --> 22:51.008
l'm dead.
Let's put this stuff up in the morning.

22:54.098 --> 22:56.471
We have to go to Bixby in the morning.

22:57.186 --> 23:01.600
-The cinder blocks are in.
-The cinder blocks. Oh, my God!

23:01.984 --> 23:04.986
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.

23:05.196 --> 23:08.732
That's the sky that'll be
over our roof every night when we're done.

23:08.826 --> 23:13.904
What if we don't finish the roof?
Then we can look at the sky all the time.

23:17.546 --> 23:19.503
That damn thing.

23:28.143 --> 23:30.848
Maybe it's time we buy a new generator.

23:38.114 --> 23:39.145
lt's gone!

23:39.366 --> 23:41.275
What do you mean, it's gone?

23:46.124 --> 23:47.952
You sure this is where it was?

23:48.169 --> 23:51.752
lt was right here! There's the cord.
Hold this.

24:00.184 --> 24:03.519
Maybe the ground caved in.
There's mines and stuff around here.

24:03.647 --> 24:06.982
Well, don't then. You don't want to fall in.

24:14.912 --> 24:15.991
Let's go.

24:16.706 --> 24:18.533
God, what is that stink?

24:21.670 --> 24:22.869
You hear that?

24:25.467 --> 24:27.591
Come on. Let's just go.

24:28.221 --> 24:31.887
Let's go back to town or something.
Please, Jim!

24:32.101 --> 24:35.387
Maybe it's a geological thing
like natural gas...

24:35.730 --> 24:39.396
...or a geyser. They stink like that.
Remember in Yellowstone?

24:41.154 --> 24:42.732
Something's got me!

24:46.536 --> 24:48.529
Something's got me down here!

24:55.256 --> 24:57.961
Get something. Get me out of here!

25:06.312 --> 25:09.183
Something's got me. Please get me out!

25:11.610 --> 25:13.021
Help me!

25:37.101 --> 25:38.347
Oh, my God.

26:40.100 --> 26:44.514
-Don't look so afraid. lt won't hurt you.
-Mindy look up. Smile.

26:44.689 --> 26:45.934
Hold it.

26:46.859 --> 26:49.018
Melvin, get out of there!

26:50.947 --> 26:55.657
-Old Chang, slick as snot, and l ain't lying.
-A lousy $15.

26:56.913 --> 26:58.574
A man who plans ahead.

26:59.166 --> 27:04.375
We arm ourselves,
we set perimeters, we stand guard.

27:05.091 --> 27:08.342
Any of those snake things show up here,
we make 'em extinct.

27:08.679 --> 27:11.170
-All right!
-Burt, get serious.

27:11.432 --> 27:13.509
Yeah! You make it sound like a war.

27:14.102 --> 27:16.226
What've you got against being prepared?

27:16.313 --> 27:17.227
Rambo.

27:17.440 --> 27:21.902
Walter's got a CB radio.
Why aren't you calling Bixby? The police--

27:22.113 --> 27:25.198
We can't reach outside the valley
because of the mountains.

27:25.283 --> 27:28.985
You're next. Sit down, look scared.

27:29.414 --> 27:32.784
The phone's out. The road's out.
We're on our own.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.411
You two are just loving it, aren't you?

27:35.505 --> 27:38.756
Nancy, don't get personal about this!
We've got to do something.

27:38.843 --> 27:40.006
Hell, yes!

27:40.929 --> 27:42.756
We are completely cut off.

27:44.099 --> 27:47.552
We got the cliffs to the north,
mountains to the east and the west.

27:49.148 --> 27:52.648
That's why Heather and me settled here.
Geographic isolation.

27:53.278 --> 27:57.324
-There's got to be a way we can get help.
-This isn't the moon!

27:57.826 --> 28:00.364
What are you going to do,
walk the 38 miles to Bixby?

28:02.999 --> 28:05.751
There's Walter's saddle horses.

28:05.878 --> 28:08.334
That's it. You're welcome to them.

28:09.299 --> 28:11.257
Somebody could ride to Bixby.

28:12.344 --> 28:14.551
That's not bad.

28:15.098 --> 28:16.723
Who's best on a horse?

28:27.489 --> 28:29.399
They better be fast.

28:29.492 --> 28:31.900
We don't want to be stuck
on a couple of canners.

28:32.621 --> 28:36.667
-Those snakes couldn't travel that fast.
-For all you know they could fly.

28:37.168 --> 28:40.455
What do you want?
This Colt or Edgar's old rifle?

28:40.548 --> 28:41.461
Rifle.

28:47.098 --> 28:50.634
-Here's some Swiss cheese and bullets.
-Thanks.

28:56.777 --> 28:59.351
-You guys all set?
-Ready as we'll ever be.

29:00.156 --> 29:04.405
We're going to find that college girl,
tell her to get her ass back into town.

29:04.704 --> 29:08.785
Good idea. We'll stop by the doctor's place
and see if they went into Bixby.

29:08.876 --> 29:10.157
Wait a minute, guys.

29:10.253 --> 29:13.338
Take something that packs
more of a punch than that .30-.30.

29:13.632 --> 29:16.005
Why don't you take
one of our Browning autos?

29:16.302 --> 29:18.675
Or better than that. Take my Model 70?

29:18.889 --> 29:21.178
lt's .375 ''H and H'' mag.

29:21.809 --> 29:23.185
Thanks, Heather.

29:23.854 --> 29:25.847
l hope we don't need to use it.

29:27.317 --> 29:28.515
lt's got me!

29:29.194 --> 29:30.523
lt's got me!

29:33.700 --> 29:35.492
-Grow up!
-Damn it!

29:37.580 --> 29:40.072
-He's only kidding.
-You came that close.

29:41.335 --> 29:43.458
Too close. No more games.

29:47.426 --> 29:50.096
One of these days
somebody's going to kick your ass.

30:29.522 --> 30:30.602
Doctor?

30:49.340 --> 30:51.416
l hate this shit.

30:53.178 --> 30:54.507
Wait a minute.

30:56.098 --> 30:58.851
The car's gone.
We just missed 'em, that's all.

31:01.355 --> 31:03.894
Where's the goddamn golden oldie
coming from?

31:19.504 --> 31:21.711
-What the hell's this?
-You got me.

31:32.479 --> 31:35.896
Here's the plan. We don't even stop.
We ride like hell.

31:36.484 --> 31:39.402
Tonight we'll keep right on going.
We'll walk the horses.

31:39.488 --> 31:44.235
That is the plan.
What the hell are those things?

31:44.328 --> 31:47.662
-How could they bury a station wagon?
-Why would they do it?

31:52.255 --> 31:53.666
Come on, git!

31:54.466 --> 31:57.752
Walter wouldn't know
a decent horse if it bit him in the ass.

31:58.137 --> 32:01.222
Wait a minute.
They got wind of something they don't like.

32:06.231 --> 32:07.607
Something's going on.

32:07.691 --> 32:09.768
l don't see anything anywhere!

32:21.542 --> 32:23.868
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. What about my horse?

32:26.257 --> 32:27.835
What in the name of--

32:32.640 --> 32:36.224
That's how they get you.
They're under the goddamn ground.

32:38.106 --> 32:41.143
-What the hell are they?
-Sons of bitches!

32:54.168 --> 32:55.746
Must be a million of 'em!

32:57.548 --> 32:59.173
Nope. Just one.

33:04.223 --> 33:05.468
Come on.

33:27.962 --> 33:29.421
He's gaining on us!

33:31.759 --> 33:32.838
Look!

33:36.097 --> 33:38.091
We can make it!

33:50.283 --> 33:51.861
Stupid son of a bitch.

33:52.953 --> 33:54.613
lt knocked itself cold.

33:56.916 --> 33:58.245
Cold, my ass!

33:59.503 --> 34:00.499
He's dead.

34:03.049 --> 34:04.212
We killed it.

34:06.470 --> 34:07.716
We killed it!

34:07.972 --> 34:09.846
Fuck you!

34:13.855 --> 34:15.728
Hey, guys. What's going on?

34:16.900 --> 34:19.190
Did you notice anything weird
a minute ago?

34:19.320 --> 34:20.898
l mean, it just happened--

34:25.911 --> 34:27.027
What's that?

34:27.205 --> 34:30.456
All right, together. One, two, three.

34:35.550 --> 34:37.043
Jesus Christ!

34:38.136 --> 34:40.426
Does it smell like that 'cause it's dead?

34:54.616 --> 34:56.194
l don't see any eyes.

34:56.994 --> 34:58.952
Must be totally subterranean.

35:02.209 --> 35:03.490
And those tentacles.

35:05.881 --> 35:09.297
You know, l think
they shoot right out of its mouth...

35:10.303 --> 35:13.305
...and they hook you and pull you right in.

35:13.974 --> 35:16.680
Good thing we stopped it
before it killed anybody else.

35:16.770 --> 35:19.012
This is important, you know.

35:19.648 --> 35:20.929
This is like...

35:21.109 --> 35:22.687
...well, let's just say it.

35:22.777 --> 35:26.194
This is probably the biggest
zoological discovery of the century.

35:27.993 --> 35:29.535
Check this out.

35:32.665 --> 35:34.290
l found the ass end.

35:35.836 --> 35:38.244
Jesus, we really caught something here.

35:44.597 --> 35:45.843
-Wow!
-Man!

35:46.892 --> 35:48.517
That's one big mother.

35:49.771 --> 35:52.773
This must be the old boy
had your seismos working overtime.

35:56.613 --> 35:58.939
lt must push itself along with these.

35:59.325 --> 36:01.235
All of them pushing at once.

36:02.913 --> 36:04.823
That's why it moved so fast.

36:06.584 --> 36:09.456
This thing had sensors tripping
all over the place. No--

36:09.546 --> 36:12.038
Rhonda, you ever heard
of anything like this?

36:12.133 --> 36:15.135
Everybody knows about 'em.
We just didn't tell you.

36:15.679 --> 36:18.385
Hell, man,
no one ever saw anything like this!

36:18.558 --> 36:20.267
We're really onto something.

36:20.519 --> 36:25.479
l'll tell you, old Chang don't get
his slick mitts on this for no measly $15.

36:25.943 --> 36:27.318
You got that right.

36:27.612 --> 36:30.186
All right, here's the plan.
We need a flatbed--

36:30.282 --> 36:32.690
-Right, with a winch.
-A five-ton maybe.

36:33.578 --> 36:36.248
No, don't want a winch. lt'd tear it all up.

36:36.331 --> 36:38.905
-A crane?
-Yeah, a crane with lifting straps.

36:39.001 --> 36:40.164
Shut up.

36:41.505 --> 36:44.293
-There are three more of these things.
-What?

36:46.136 --> 36:47.049
Three more?

36:47.137 --> 36:50.304
l've got seismographs all over the valley.
Compare the readings.

36:50.391 --> 36:52.135
Here's one at 2:00 yesterday.

36:52.477 --> 36:55.598
But here's one three miles away
at the exact time. That's two.

36:55.773 --> 36:57.647
-But here--
-We'll take your word.

36:57.734 --> 37:00.486
-Yeah, where's your truck?
-Just beyond that hill.

37:07.830 --> 37:09.029
What?

37:13.171 --> 37:17.252
-Damn prairie dog burrow.
-Little sons of bitches.

37:30.234 --> 37:31.314
This way!

37:34.532 --> 37:35.907
Up on that rock!

37:50.511 --> 37:52.468
Looks like the one that got our truck.

37:52.555 --> 37:55.391
-Where the hell's your truck?
-Right over there.

37:55.851 --> 37:58.093
l don't think we can make that.

38:00.607 --> 38:01.936
At least he can't climb.

38:09.702 --> 38:11.826
Live ones smell worse than the dead ones.

38:31.397 --> 38:32.892
l got it.

38:33.191 --> 38:35.564
They're mutations caused by radiation.

38:36.195 --> 38:37.226
Or no.

38:37.822 --> 38:41.073
The government built 'em.
Big surprise for the Russians.

38:41.535 --> 38:44.870
There's nothing like them
in the fossil record. l'm sure.

38:46.124 --> 38:49.874
Okay, so, they predate the fossil record.

38:51.340 --> 38:54.092
That would make 'em
a couple billion years old.

38:54.385 --> 38:56.793
And we've just never seen one 'til now.

38:57.514 --> 38:58.463
Right.

38:58.682 --> 39:02.183
l vote for outer space.
No way these are local boys.

39:06.776 --> 39:09.778
Well, haven't seen a sign for hours.

39:12.116 --> 39:13.576
Must be long gone.

39:13.869 --> 39:15.114
Yeah, must be.

39:16.622 --> 39:19.244
Why don't you take
a little stroll and find out?

39:23.256 --> 39:24.715
We've got to do something.

39:35.605 --> 39:37.314
''We've got to do something.''

39:37.483 --> 39:40.983
l don't know why ''we''
always has to be ''me'' every damn time.

39:41.613 --> 39:45.826
We, we, we. What do l look like?
An expert on worms?

39:45.910 --> 39:48.319
Watch it, it's got a good six-foot reach.

39:48.414 --> 39:49.789
Thank you, Earl.

39:53.879 --> 39:55.457
Son of a bitch!

39:55.631 --> 39:59.250
Son of a goddamn bitch!
Pardon my French.

40:00.513 --> 40:04.761
Shit! lt's been waiting here all this time?
How's it know we're still here?

40:07.104 --> 40:10.771
lt's got no eyes, right?
Sure as hell can't smell us underground.

40:10.859 --> 40:12.058
lt's been listening.

40:13.112 --> 40:14.227
Of course!

40:14.781 --> 40:17.237
lt senses seismic vibration.

40:17.451 --> 40:21.532
lt can hear every move we make
on this rock. lt's a perfect conductor!

40:21.915 --> 40:24.489
That means we're stuck.
That pisses me off!

40:34.390 --> 40:38.091
l hate to be crude,
but l've got to take care of business.

40:38.687 --> 40:40.894
-Me, too.
-Same here.

41:10.019 --> 41:11.015
Thanks.

41:12.856 --> 41:14.933
No problem. Anytime.

41:27.041 --> 41:28.666
Well, what's the plan?

41:29.461 --> 41:33.543
The first thing we've got to do
is see if old Stumpy's still out there.

41:36.303 --> 41:38.380
-Can l borrow that shovel?
-Yeah.

41:47.777 --> 41:49.853
Doesn't he have a home to go to?

41:50.030 --> 41:52.700
That's why Edgar never got down
off that damn tower.

41:52.783 --> 41:53.982
l have an idea.

41:54.076 --> 41:58.656
You know, we have to come up with a plan
or he's going to wait us to death.

41:58.958 --> 42:02.043
-l was thinking--
-Why not run? We outran him yesterday.

42:02.129 --> 42:06.210
Run for it? Running's not a plan.
Running's what you do when a plan fails.

42:06.301 --> 42:08.341
You're not trying to think of a plan.

42:08.428 --> 42:10.885
lt ain't like we got a hell of a lot of options.

42:10.973 --> 42:14.094
There's always options.
We've just got to think of them.

42:14.186 --> 42:15.930
Why don't you start thinking?

42:16.147 --> 42:18.473
Why do l always
have to do all the thinking?

42:18.567 --> 42:22.067
-Who died and made you Einstein?
-You know how to pole vault?

42:27.829 --> 42:29.620
We just stay where he can't get us...

42:31.417 --> 42:34.869
...on these residual boulders.
My truck's parked next to one.

42:47.688 --> 42:49.480
Stay on those residual boulders!

42:52.068 --> 42:55.937
That Tammy Lynn Baxter,
she do much pole vaulting?

43:19.020 --> 43:20.515
That's pretty good.

43:40.715 --> 43:43.717
That slimebag won't give us much time
once we hit that truck.

43:44.011 --> 43:46.218
-l say we all jump together.
-Right.

43:46.806 --> 43:47.837
Wait.

43:50.561 --> 43:52.103
Okay, ready.

43:52.647 --> 43:55.518
One, two, three!

44:03.703 --> 44:05.245
Go!

44:08.292 --> 44:09.324
Watch it, Val!

44:13.215 --> 44:14.674
Move!

44:25.815 --> 44:28.817
Can somebody, perhaps, help me?

44:30.821 --> 44:32.067
No!

44:32.156 --> 44:36.025
The snake things are just their tongues.
These animals are huge!

44:36.162 --> 44:39.199
l'm sorry.
l'm having a real difficult time with this.

44:40.334 --> 44:43.454
Come on, you guys, answer.

44:43.713 --> 44:46.383
-Where's Burt and Heather?
-l can't reach them.

44:47.551 --> 44:49.675
l guess they're still driving around.

44:49.763 --> 44:52.468
What's the name you call those things?

44:52.600 --> 44:54.343
Where do they come from?

44:55.311 --> 44:57.934
-l don't know.
-You're a scientist, aren't you?

44:58.023 --> 45:00.016
Aren't you supposed to have a theory?

45:01.194 --> 45:03.602
These creatures
are absolutely unprecedented.

45:03.906 --> 45:05.983
But where do they come from?

45:06.075 --> 45:07.107
Yeah!

45:09.121 --> 45:11.114
lt doesn't matter where they come from.

45:12.208 --> 45:14.000
No name.

45:14.545 --> 45:16.953
We discovered them,
we should name them!

45:18.341 --> 45:19.919
Forget the damn name!

45:21.011 --> 45:23.337
Now me and Earl need to get
out of this valley.

45:23.473 --> 45:25.715
Hang on. Let's not go off half-cocked.

45:25.809 --> 45:30.473
Somebody's bound to come check on us
once they see the road is out...

45:30.565 --> 45:33.318
-...and the lines are down.
-That's how it works.

45:54.513 --> 45:59.307
-''Suckoids.''
-''Oids.'' l like ''snakeoids.''

45:59.394 --> 46:03.144
One of them comes near me
and l'll hit him with a five-pound pickax.

46:03.275 --> 46:06.645
You don't understand. They come up
from the ground and grab you.

46:06.737 --> 46:09.407
They sense the slightest vibration
through the ground.

46:09.491 --> 46:12.161
Even footsteps. That's how they hunt.

46:13.580 --> 46:15.656
So we don't vibrate, right?

46:16.417 --> 46:18.624
Maybe they won't even come through here.

46:19.003 --> 46:20.628
Maybe they'll leave us alone!

46:21.131 --> 46:23.290
Chain saw. That's what l'll use.

46:24.510 --> 46:25.625
Wake up!

46:26.054 --> 46:27.383
Now, look!

46:32.479 --> 46:34.437
They're headed right for us!

46:35.024 --> 46:37.812
They trapped Edgar here.
Grabbed old Fred right here.

46:37.986 --> 46:41.736
Nailed those two poor suckers on the road
and the doctor's place is here!

46:42.283 --> 46:45.155
This valley is just one long smorgasbord.

46:45.538 --> 46:48.575
We have got to get out.

46:51.754 --> 46:53.297
l'm going to get Mindy.

46:53.381 --> 46:56.051
She's okay.
l saw her playing down the street.

46:56.510 --> 47:00.379
That's what l like, ''Graboids''!
That's it, ''graboids''!

47:00.766 --> 47:02.308
Jesus, Walter.

47:02.476 --> 47:04.885
We're going to be sorry
if we don't give it a name.

47:05.313 --> 47:09.098
Okay, you say let's get out of here.
Where are we supposed to go?

47:11.112 --> 47:13.438
Rhonda's got an idea about that.

47:13.699 --> 47:17.235
See, they move very easily
through the Pleistocene alluvials.

47:20.249 --> 47:23.750
The dirt. The loose soil
that covers the valley floor.

47:23.837 --> 47:25.629
But they can't move through rock.

47:25.840 --> 47:29.376
-We should go west to the mountains.
-She means up the old Jeep trail.

47:29.470 --> 47:31.759
lf those mountains are granite
we'd be safe.

47:31.848 --> 47:34.256
We could hike along them to Bixby if we--

47:37.438 --> 47:39.182
l scared you, didn't l?

47:40.818 --> 47:42.443
You little ass wipe.

47:42.528 --> 47:46.230
You don't knock it off,
you're going to be shitting this basketball.

47:48.703 --> 47:50.079
Pardon my French.

48:00.134 --> 48:03.220
lt's going to take us days
to get back with help with Nestor.

48:03.305 --> 48:05.548
We're not going to leave you alone.

48:09.772 --> 48:12.893
-Damn it! l'm going to kick his ass!
-l'm going to help you.

48:17.448 --> 48:19.572
Where is that little shit stain?

48:24.791 --> 48:26.500
Melvin, get your--

48:30.048 --> 48:31.211
Get inside!

48:45.610 --> 48:48.528
-Run! Come on!
-Come on, get in!

48:50.616 --> 48:53.322
-Walter, you got a gun?
-No!

48:54.038 --> 48:56.576
-What are we going to do?
-Be quiet!

48:58.919 --> 49:00.082
Where is he?

49:19.738 --> 49:24.531
Now remember, no noise, no vibrations.

49:34.715 --> 49:36.507
No, Mindy.

49:36.843 --> 49:37.792
Stop.

49:37.886 --> 49:39.844
Mindy, get off the pogo stick.

49:44.728 --> 49:46.805
-Get her, Val!
-Mindy, come back!

49:59.247 --> 50:00.623
Be quiet. Don't move.

50:04.546 --> 50:06.539
Mindy, get back.

50:07.883 --> 50:09.841
Run! Get in the house!

50:19.231 --> 50:21.355
Get him off or it'll suck that truck down.

50:23.278 --> 50:25.022
Go back, for Chrissake!

50:27.742 --> 50:29.451
Jesus, here comes another one!

50:31.497 --> 50:33.325
Run! Come on!

51:29.823 --> 51:31.282
Get out of your pants!

51:38.125 --> 51:39.205
Look out!

51:52.352 --> 51:53.218
Run!

51:58.694 --> 52:00.651
Don't look back. Come on!

52:16.675 --> 52:17.541
Sorry.

52:40.456 --> 52:43.328
-Rhonda, here.
-Thank you.

52:45.212 --> 52:49.211
What are we going to do?
How long 'til they go away?

52:50.052 --> 52:52.092
They got the patience of Job.

52:53.098 --> 52:56.799
They sit and wait until they hear
something that sounds like lunch.

52:57.019 --> 52:59.772
-We've got to have a plan.
-l got a plan.

52:59.898 --> 53:04.395
You drive the truck up to the mountain,
walk to Bixby, get some help.

53:04.612 --> 53:08.658
-Those scumsuckers ate our radials.
-You can take my truck.

53:09.243 --> 53:13.159
No, we need a major four-wheel drive
just to get up that Jeep trail.

53:13.916 --> 53:15.744
That trail's all messed up.

53:19.090 --> 53:20.833
Turn it off!

53:22.511 --> 53:23.460
Pull it back!

53:29.311 --> 53:30.640
l got it.

53:42.453 --> 53:44.162
Give me your hand!

53:55.887 --> 53:57.512
Son of a bitch.

53:58.933 --> 54:00.475
Son of a bitch!

54:16.873 --> 54:18.747
Come on, let's go! The roof!

54:39.360 --> 54:40.143
Come on!

54:46.036 --> 54:48.658
-Jump! You can do it!
-l can't!

54:54.588 --> 54:57.294
Don't stop. Keep moving!

55:01.431 --> 55:03.139
Oh, my God.

55:10.609 --> 55:11.724
You okay?

55:15.032 --> 55:17.404
What's going on? Where are you guys?

55:18.035 --> 55:21.037
What's up?
What the hell are you doing up there?

55:21.290 --> 55:23.247
Shut the hell up.

55:23.376 --> 55:25.250
-Get up on your roof.
-No way!

55:47.782 --> 55:50.452
Nancy, get up on your roofs.

55:50.578 --> 55:53.864
Up on your roofs!
They come through the floor.

56:05.722 --> 56:08.131
l don't know. l can't believe it.

56:09.269 --> 56:10.514
No tracks.

56:11.480 --> 56:13.639
No sign. No spoor.

56:14.692 --> 56:18.643
You'd think after eating all those sheep
they'd have to take a dump someplace.

56:18.739 --> 56:20.863
Yeah. l don't understand it.

56:41.477 --> 56:44.147
<i>Walter, this is Burt. Come back</i>.

56:46.692 --> 56:49.314
<i>Walter? Anybody copy?</i>

56:51.031 --> 56:52.526
<i>l'm waiting</i>.

56:52.992 --> 56:56.160
<i>-Walter, you there? Come back!</i>
-Okay, l got it.

57:05.758 --> 57:08.167
<i>Who's minding the store, for God's sake?</i>

57:08.470 --> 57:12.255
Burt, listen.
We found out what's been killing people.

57:12.559 --> 57:14.433
-Say ''over.''
-Over.

57:14.645 --> 57:18.181
Negative copy on that, Walter.
Check your frequency.

57:19.359 --> 57:21.518
l'm on 22. Come back.

57:21.654 --> 57:24.490
<i>Burt, can you hear me now? Over</i>.

57:24.741 --> 57:26.948
ls that you?
What're you doing back already?

57:27.036 --> 57:29.243
Something real weird's going on
over there.

57:29.331 --> 57:30.956
They're up on top of the roof.

57:48.188 --> 57:50.431
l think they're going for Burt's.

57:53.946 --> 57:55.904
Man! They're going!

57:56.658 --> 57:59.778
Burt, get out of your basement.
Take your radio.

57:59.995 --> 58:03.412
You and Heather get up on your roof.
We'll talk later. Over.

58:03.750 --> 58:06.123
Up on the roof?
What are you talking about?

58:06.212 --> 58:08.882
Damn it, Burt. Listen to him.
Something's wrong.

58:09.716 --> 58:11.092
<i>Burt, Jesus Christ!</i>

58:11.427 --> 58:13.385
Get up on your roof! The things!

58:13.471 --> 58:16.343
<i>They're under the ground</i>.
<i>They're bigger than we thought</i>.

58:16.433 --> 58:19.886
<i>They're huge. They're coming after you</i>.
<i>They're coming right now!</i>

58:37.169 --> 58:40.788
We don't see anything. What the hell
are you talking about? Over.

58:41.424 --> 58:44.379
They're under the ground!

58:44.470 --> 58:48.219
<i>They can dig. Big monsters!</i>
<i>Underground! Now get out!</i>

58:48.308 --> 58:49.553
<i>Hurry!</i>

59:10.879 --> 59:12.208
<i>Jesus--</i>

59:52.141 --> 59:53.635
Burt, come on.

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:04.275
Magazine!

01:00:27.145 --> 01:00:28.604
Here!

01:01:14.498 --> 01:01:18.746
Broke into the wrong goddamn rec room,
didn't you, you bastard?

01:01:20.672 --> 01:01:24.588
<i>We killed it! You got that?</i>
<i>We killed that motherhumper! Come back</i>.

01:01:26.138 --> 01:01:29.223
Roger that, Burt. And congratulations.

01:01:29.308 --> 01:01:33.473
Be advised, however, there are two more.
Repeat, two more motherhumpers.

01:01:46.205 --> 01:01:47.914
Burt got one! He killed one!

01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:51.708
-Way to go, dude!
-All right!

01:01:57.178 --> 01:02:00.464
l guess we don't get to make fun
of Burt's lifestyle anymore.

01:02:00.724 --> 01:02:01.673
Say, Burt?

01:02:01.976 --> 01:02:04.681
<i>Any chance you can get the other two?</i>
<i>Come back</i>.

01:02:05.856 --> 01:02:07.600
One second, pal.

01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:19.408
You didn't get penetration
even with the elephant gun.

01:02:21.209 --> 01:02:22.620
Good Lord!

01:02:29.595 --> 01:02:30.758
<i>We can't get 'em</i>.

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.589
<i>l never figured</i>
<i>on having to shoot through dirt</i>.

01:02:33.684 --> 01:02:36.555
<i>The best goddamn bullet stop there is</i>.
<i>Come back</i>.

01:02:38.398 --> 01:02:39.643
Let me see that.

01:02:41.193 --> 01:02:44.480
Forget shooting them.
Can you get to your truck?

01:02:44.823 --> 01:02:46.021
<i>-Over</i>.
-No problem.

01:02:46.116 --> 01:02:48.952
<i>You have the only truck</i>
<i>that can get up that Jeep trail</i>.

01:02:49.287 --> 01:02:50.996
Now listen. Here's the plan.

01:02:51.081 --> 01:02:53.999
You and Heather go for help.
You get to the mountains and--

01:02:54.085 --> 01:02:55.877
You guys!

01:02:57.047 --> 01:02:58.756
-Come over.
-Hang on a sec.

01:03:00.468 --> 01:03:04.052
-He's up to something.
-lf it isn't our old pal Stumpy.

01:03:04.557 --> 01:03:05.672
Bastard.

01:03:14.028 --> 01:03:16.353
What do you think it's trying to do?

01:03:16.906 --> 01:03:18.816
Why do you keep asking me?

01:03:44.442 --> 01:03:45.818
What the hell was that?

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:49.775
<i>Breaker there, Earl</i>.
<i>What did you want us to do?</i>

01:03:49.907 --> 01:03:50.939
<i>Come back</i>.

01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:55.114
Hang on, Burt.
This bastard's trying something new.

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:57.365
Over.

01:04:13.688 --> 01:04:17.687
They wasn't making no noise.
Why is he bothering them?

01:04:17.902 --> 01:04:21.070
lt's like it's studying the buildings,
trying to figure them out.

01:04:21.448 --> 01:04:24.569
They can feel our vibrations
but they can't find us.

01:04:24.744 --> 01:04:27.236
Looks to me
like they're coming up with a plan.

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:36.000
Watch it, Nestor!

01:04:48.316 --> 01:04:50.191
Shit! Enough!

01:04:57.203 --> 01:05:01.416
-Get off the ground! Get moving!
-Get out of there!

01:05:02.335 --> 01:05:03.533
Move it!

01:05:04.963 --> 01:05:08.131
No, that's no good!
You've got to get higher!

01:05:19.524 --> 01:05:21.433
No way!

01:05:22.402 --> 01:05:25.108
No! You guys have got to do something!

01:05:26.449 --> 01:05:28.692
You've got to do something!

01:05:32.666 --> 01:05:34.992
<i>Burt? Heather?</i>

01:05:37.797 --> 01:05:39.956
You got us. Come on back. Over.

01:05:40.634 --> 01:05:44.051
<i>We're in deep shit over here</i>.
<i>We'll have to change that plan</i>.

01:05:46.851 --> 01:05:49.342
-Burt, cut it out!
-l think l scared him.

01:05:49.729 --> 01:05:51.189
<i>No use going for help</i>.

01:05:51.899 --> 01:05:54.473
<i>We'd be dead</i>
<i>long before you'd ever get back</i>.

01:05:55.153 --> 01:05:57.561
<i>We're with you</i>.
<i>Tell us what you want to do</i>.

01:05:58.783 --> 01:06:01.275
This one's going to tear this town
out from under us.

01:06:01.369 --> 01:06:03.695
We're going to have to
get out of here together...

01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:05.581
-...<i>now</i>.
-Okay.

01:06:05.667 --> 01:06:08.704
We're coming after everybody.
Just hang tight. Over.

01:06:34.162 --> 01:06:36.451
<i>You're going to have to</i>
<i>forget about the truck</i>.

01:06:36.916 --> 01:06:38.576
Yeah, we've got you, Heather.

01:06:42.214 --> 01:06:43.792
The situation hasn't changed.

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:47.336
We still have to make it to solid rock.
There's got to be a way.

01:06:47.638 --> 01:06:51.589
Like what? There's nothing left
that can make it to those mountains.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.058
Quiet, man.

01:06:56.649 --> 01:06:58.975
lt doesn't matter now.
They know we're here.

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:03.273
We need a helicopter. Or a goddamn tank!

01:07:03.617 --> 01:07:07.069
Wait a minute. The Cat!

01:07:07.372 --> 01:07:10.658
-Could we take the Cat?
-Jesus. lt's slower than hell.

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:14.544
But it weighs more than 30 tons.
There's no way they could lift that.

01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:18.500
-Could they? l mean--
-But we can't all fit on the bulldozer.

01:07:22.767 --> 01:07:24.511
No, but we could...

01:07:24.894 --> 01:07:29.356
...drag something, though.
We could pull a car behind it. l don't know.

01:07:30.110 --> 01:07:32.399
Hell, that old semitrailer.

01:07:33.072 --> 01:07:35.148
-lts tires are flat.
-Doesn't matter.

01:07:35.283 --> 01:07:37.193
That Cat can pull anything.

01:07:39.163 --> 01:07:42.367
-We just roll on out of here.
-We've got a plan!

01:07:47.424 --> 01:07:50.260
Of course, that's a hell of a long walk.

01:07:51.596 --> 01:07:54.004
They only respond to vibration, right?

01:07:54.182 --> 01:07:56.757
Couldn't we distract them somehow?

01:07:58.313 --> 01:08:01.897
Good. Something to keep 'em busy.
Like a decoy.

01:08:03.361 --> 01:08:05.687
Melvin, you want to make a buck?

01:08:06.365 --> 01:08:07.279
Eat it!

01:08:07.366 --> 01:08:11.116
How about Walter's little tractor?
Start him up.

01:08:11.622 --> 01:08:13.330
Let him go out by himself.

01:08:13.416 --> 01:08:16.582
Let those things follow him all over
if they like that noise.

01:08:17.837 --> 01:08:19.997
Not bad. What do you think?

01:08:33.024 --> 01:08:36.359
Ground's getting closer.
l say we go with Miguel's plan.

01:09:04.064 --> 01:09:05.475
Hold on, Nancy!

01:09:05.567 --> 01:09:07.856
-l'm making the run for the Cat.
-Like hell.

01:09:07.944 --> 01:09:10.697
-l'm faster than you.
-But l'm best at driving the Cat.

01:09:10.782 --> 01:09:14.697
-Not while l'm around.
-Listen to me. l'm older and wiser.

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:16.662
Well you're half right.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:23.295
Damn! l lost. Guess l'll have to do it.

01:09:23.881 --> 01:09:25.591
l won. l pick who does it.

01:09:26.551 --> 01:09:28.176
Ready when you are, Miguel.

01:09:43.491 --> 01:09:46.064
There he is. There he goes!

01:09:46.328 --> 01:09:47.407
He's chasing it!

01:09:52.961 --> 01:09:56.047
lt's going. This one's going, too!

01:09:57.634 --> 01:10:00.921
-Good luck, shithead.
-Don't worry about me, jerk-off.

01:10:11.611 --> 01:10:14.696
You suicidal son of a bitch.

01:10:30.677 --> 01:10:31.958
Keep going!

01:10:40.231 --> 01:10:41.774
Oh, my God.

01:10:45.363 --> 01:10:46.193
Come on!

01:10:48.575 --> 01:10:50.118
They're going to get him!

01:10:51.913 --> 01:10:54.915
Val, stop! They're coming! Be quiet!

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.199
Don't move!

01:11:06.974 --> 01:11:09.644
lt worked. They can't find him.

01:11:17.488 --> 01:11:18.733
We've got to...

01:11:20.074 --> 01:11:21.866
...make some noise.

01:11:22.327 --> 01:11:23.738
A lot of noise!

01:11:24.413 --> 01:11:27.830
You sorry sons of bitches.
Come and get my ass!

01:11:27.918 --> 01:11:31.584
Over here, you slime bucket!
Come get me!

01:11:42.478 --> 01:11:44.637
What are you, scared? Come on.

01:11:57.164 --> 01:11:58.363
What's she doing?

01:12:11.766 --> 01:12:14.804
That did it, girl! Goddamn good thinking.

01:13:41.257 --> 01:13:42.835
-You okay?
-Yeah.

01:13:48.392 --> 01:13:49.305
Here goes.

01:14:00.199 --> 01:14:01.397
-Here.
-Yeah.

01:14:20.725 --> 01:14:23.846
Goddamn! Armored transport.

01:14:26.107 --> 01:14:28.100
Let's get going!

01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:33.448
Come on, let's go, you two.
We're headed for the mountains.

01:14:33.617 --> 01:14:36.191
lf that's how we're doing it,
we're going prepared.

01:14:36.329 --> 01:14:39.699
We can't hold still long.
These things are damn smart.

01:14:39.792 --> 01:14:42.366
-They're getting smarter by the minute.
-Fine.

01:14:42.754 --> 01:14:44.830
We've got some new things to teach 'em.

01:14:58.649 --> 01:14:59.895
You see that?

01:15:00.277 --> 01:15:03.611
They're doing it again.
They try it every time we stop!

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:08.073
Jesus Christ! We're only going nine miles.

01:15:08.412 --> 01:15:11.829
Those things will be on our ass
every foot of the way, right?

01:15:11.917 --> 01:15:15.334
-Just hurry!
-What are you doing up there?

01:15:15.421 --> 01:15:17.995
-Can't you see we are sinking.
-Get in the trailer!

01:15:18.091 --> 01:15:20.665
What do you think? Max firepower or this?

01:15:20.761 --> 01:15:25.010
l go for penetration. The .458,
shooting solids. Less ammo to carry.

01:15:25.184 --> 01:15:26.844
Come on. Move it!

01:15:27.854 --> 01:15:29.598
Watch these ammo boxes!

01:15:30.107 --> 01:15:32.599
-Come on, Burt!
-Heather, hurry!

01:15:33.152 --> 01:15:35.276
-Tell 'em to come on!
-Okay, now!

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:37.488
Now! Come on!

01:15:43.499 --> 01:15:45.124
Give me a gun. l'll take one.

01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:48.295
l wouldn't give you a gun
if it was World War lll.

01:16:07.071 --> 01:16:09.646
Food for five years.

01:16:10.534 --> 01:16:14.580
1,000 gallons of gas,
air and water filtration, Geiger counter...

01:16:14.957 --> 01:16:16.617
...bomb shelter.

01:16:19.588 --> 01:16:22.755
Underground. Goddamn monsters!

01:16:35.817 --> 01:16:38.523
There we go! Fallen Rock.

01:16:46.247 --> 01:16:47.825
Any sign of them?

01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:50.951
Maybe they just gave up, you know?

01:16:54.508 --> 01:16:55.623
What's that?

01:16:57.762 --> 01:17:00.336
Damn it! What the hell are they doing?

01:17:00.432 --> 01:17:04.763
l don't care what they're doing
as long as they're doing it way over there.

01:17:11.572 --> 01:17:13.280
Wait! Look out!

01:17:21.835 --> 01:17:23.496
-Burt, you okay?
-l'm okay.

01:17:23.587 --> 01:17:25.711
Are they going to get us? What happened?

01:17:27.759 --> 01:17:30.430
-Burt, you sure you're okay?
-Yeah.

01:17:32.057 --> 01:17:33.516
What happened?

01:17:34.435 --> 01:17:36.013
They dug a trap.

01:17:36.521 --> 01:17:38.015
l can't believe this.

01:17:40.025 --> 01:17:41.306
All right.

01:17:42.195 --> 01:17:43.144
Here.

01:17:56.755 --> 01:17:58.084
Let me have my gun.

01:18:02.847 --> 01:18:05.303
Hungry? Eat this!

01:18:05.934 --> 01:18:07.642
Everybody down!

01:18:17.157 --> 01:18:18.153
There they are!

01:18:18.909 --> 01:18:20.902
-Did you kill one?
-l don't know.

01:18:21.204 --> 01:18:22.782
No, there's still two of them.

01:18:22.873 --> 01:18:26.077
-There're two different dust trails.
-Made them think twice.

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:27.497
What's in those?

01:18:27.587 --> 01:18:30.209
A few household chemicals
in the proper proportion.

01:18:35.556 --> 01:18:37.632
Here they come. They're coming back!

01:18:45.443 --> 01:18:47.650
We'll have to make a run for those rocks.

01:18:47.822 --> 01:18:51.026
-l don't know. That's a long way.
-They'll get us!

01:18:51.117 --> 01:18:53.740
They're going to get us if we stay here.

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:57.701
-You have any more of those bombs?
-We've got you covered.

01:18:57.793 --> 01:19:02.041
What if we throw one that way, the way
we want to go? Then when it explodes...

01:19:02.173 --> 01:19:05.341
...if it drives them away,
we run like goddamn bastards.

01:19:06.262 --> 01:19:07.377
Pardon my French.

01:19:08.974 --> 01:19:11.810
What if they don't get scared?
What if they don't run?

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:15.012
l don't think it does scare them.
lt hurts them.

01:19:15.107 --> 01:19:17.314
They're sensitive to sound, they'll run.

01:19:17.402 --> 01:19:19.062
Hell, she's got my vote!

01:19:19.196 --> 01:19:21.818
That's it! We're making a run for it!

01:19:21.907 --> 01:19:25.075
-We're going for the rocks.
-l don't know. They're too fast.

01:19:25.162 --> 01:19:29.741
-You can't out run 'em. No way!
-This'll make 'em think twice.

01:19:29.834 --> 01:19:33.002
Everybody ready to run?

01:19:38.929 --> 01:19:40.554
Heads down!

01:19:48.984 --> 01:19:50.942
lt worked! There they go!

01:19:51.237 --> 01:19:52.400
Let's go!

01:19:58.663 --> 01:20:00.039
Come on, Burt.

01:20:05.506 --> 01:20:06.965
You asshole!

01:20:12.723 --> 01:20:13.969
Get up.

01:20:22.319 --> 01:20:24.526
-Get up here!
-l'm with you, honey.

01:20:25.365 --> 01:20:26.990
Go!

01:20:33.792 --> 01:20:36.830
You asshole!
There are no bullets in this gun.

01:20:37.589 --> 01:20:39.381
Got you moving, didn't it?

01:21:08.963 --> 01:21:10.457
So now what?

01:21:11.424 --> 01:21:14.711
Could we make it to the mountains?
Use Burt's explosives?

01:21:14.929 --> 01:21:16.092
No way.

01:21:16.765 --> 01:21:18.557
We'd need 50 of those bombs.

01:21:19.143 --> 01:21:20.258
That's it.

01:21:21.437 --> 01:21:23.146
We're not getting off this rock.

01:21:25.568 --> 01:21:29.234
We're not going to pole vault out of here.
That's for damn sure.

01:21:29.948 --> 01:21:33.069
Wait a minute. What're you talking about?

01:21:33.662 --> 01:21:35.405
lt's like you're giving up.

01:21:35.497 --> 01:21:39.745
They'll wait out there 'til we're dead.
That's exactly what they do.

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:42.376
Wait!

01:21:43.466 --> 01:21:47.963
For Chrissake, we could've made a stand
at our place. We had food, water....

01:21:48.306 --> 01:21:49.966
You can't fight 'em like that.

01:21:50.058 --> 01:21:53.095
So you two screw-ups
hauled us way the hell out here?

01:21:57.985 --> 01:22:02.529
Why don't you just back off, string bean?
We could've left your ass on the roof!

01:22:02.616 --> 01:22:05.820
l wish you had, fearless leader.
Who put you two in charge?

01:22:05.912 --> 01:22:08.154
Don't push me!

01:22:11.252 --> 01:22:13.411
lf them graboids don't kill him, l will.

01:22:13.839 --> 01:22:14.752
What?

01:22:15.841 --> 01:22:18.333
They'd have torn up your place
in half an hour.

01:22:18.428 --> 01:22:21.845
Come on. Just let it go. Forget about it.

01:22:23.268 --> 01:22:25.890
l know he does.
He thinks he knows everything.

01:22:37.494 --> 01:22:41.078
lf it comes to starvation,
l know what l'm doing.

01:22:42.876 --> 01:22:44.252
Take one of these...

01:22:45.129 --> 01:22:49.543
...walk right out there with the fuse lit
and let 'em take me down.

01:22:55.726 --> 01:22:57.351
Good Lord, honey.

01:22:59.231 --> 01:23:00.891
Now that's not a bad idea.

01:23:02.443 --> 01:23:04.401
No. lt gives me an idea.

01:23:04.947 --> 01:23:06.227
Going fishing.

01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:13.537
There's one. Straight out in front.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.207
Let's see if we can keep him right there.

01:23:16.461 --> 01:23:19.380
-How much we need?
-l don't know. They're pretty quick.

01:23:19.674 --> 01:23:21.085
Fifteen seconds at least.

01:23:23.554 --> 01:23:26.224
-Which kind of fuse is that?
-Cannon fuse.

01:23:26.308 --> 01:23:29.262
-What the hell you use if for?
-My cannon.

01:23:29.729 --> 01:23:31.805
You guys watch yourselves.

01:23:35.027 --> 01:23:37.067
Right out there, about 30--

01:23:37.405 --> 01:23:41.487
-You're not going do your lasso thing?
-Just 'cause you're no good with a rope.

01:23:46.417 --> 01:23:47.912
All right, get back!

01:23:57.765 --> 01:23:58.963
Come on, baby.

01:23:59.559 --> 01:24:01.517
Take it. Take the bait!

01:24:07.528 --> 01:24:09.236
Yeah! All right!

01:24:14.036 --> 01:24:15.151
Look at it!

01:24:34.855 --> 01:24:36.682
Okay, one to go.

01:24:38.276 --> 01:24:40.234
Damn! Where the hell is he?

01:24:41.697 --> 01:24:43.524
Hope he didn't wise up.

01:24:46.370 --> 01:24:47.651
There.

01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:50.035
Look who it is.

01:24:51.126 --> 01:24:52.751
Give me that thing.

01:24:53.295 --> 01:24:55.170
This son of a bitch is mine.

01:24:58.552 --> 01:24:59.928
There it goes!

01:25:00.471 --> 01:25:02.299
-All right, get back!
-l got it.

01:25:02.474 --> 01:25:03.672
Come on.

01:25:16.868 --> 01:25:18.825
Come on. Lunchtime, slophead.

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:23.458
All right, get down!

01:25:31.011 --> 01:25:32.506
Oh, my God! lt's coming--

01:25:32.638 --> 01:25:34.263
Get back! Run!

01:25:36.101 --> 01:25:37.180
Get up, come on!

01:25:53.332 --> 01:25:55.325
What're you doing out there?

01:26:10.562 --> 01:26:14.347
Okay, let's make some noise.
Try to distract them.

01:26:29.712 --> 01:26:30.875
Fresh meat!

01:26:45.107 --> 01:26:46.388
Wait.

01:26:49.154 --> 01:26:51.277
This one's not falling for it.

01:26:53.284 --> 01:26:54.909
This one ain't dumb.

01:26:56.121 --> 01:26:57.865
He's trying to trick us.

01:27:00.001 --> 01:27:01.496
Use your bomb.

01:27:02.129 --> 01:27:04.169
lt's our last one.

01:27:05.592 --> 01:27:07.300
What else you going use it for?

01:27:08.888 --> 01:27:13.017
So what if we make it to the rocks.
We'll be dead in three days anyway.

01:27:13.602 --> 01:27:15.679
l want to live for the three days.

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:17.689
What the hell? What's the matter?

01:27:17.858 --> 01:27:21.025
-Use the bomb, for God's sake!
-Throw that bomb, man!

01:27:21.362 --> 01:27:23.272
Scare 'em away!

01:27:24.074 --> 01:27:25.818
Throw the bomb!

01:27:29.498 --> 01:27:31.705
This bastard ain't smarter than us.

01:27:33.128 --> 01:27:35.037
For Chrissake, Val!

01:27:35.172 --> 01:27:37.580
-l'm going to go for it.
-Go for what?

01:27:49.691 --> 01:27:53.025
-What are you doing?
-l got a goddamn plan!

01:27:56.241 --> 01:27:57.486
Where the hell is it?

01:28:01.623 --> 01:28:03.201
l've got it!

01:28:08.674 --> 01:28:11.212
This better be one hell of a great plan!

01:28:18.895 --> 01:28:19.975
Get ready!

01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:22.933
-Light it, man!
-Not yet.

01:28:23.610 --> 01:28:24.985
What are you waiting for?

01:28:26.488 --> 01:28:27.603
Go!

01:28:28.866 --> 01:28:30.195
Come on!

01:28:32.663 --> 01:28:34.870
Too far! You threw it behind him.

01:28:42.718 --> 01:28:43.714
Run!

01:28:51.271 --> 01:28:53.430
Can you fly, you sucker?

01:29:23.604 --> 01:29:26.392
lt just suddenly hit me, you know.

01:29:27.192 --> 01:29:28.735
Stampede.

01:29:45.716 --> 01:29:46.796
Now...

01:29:47.468 --> 01:29:50.470
...the second we hit Bixby,
we start making phone calls.

01:29:50.597 --> 01:29:53.220
We could make some real money
on this thing.

01:29:53.309 --> 01:29:55.682
We could get in <i>People</i> magazine.

01:29:55.938 --> 01:29:58.726
<i>People</i> ? Hell! National Geographic.

01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.986
Smile.

01:30:16.923 --> 01:30:18.751
Burt loaned me his camera.

01:30:19.009 --> 01:30:21.252
Yeah. He gave us these tires, too.

01:30:26.519 --> 01:30:28.429
lt's all pretty exciting, huh?

01:30:29.523 --> 01:30:32.727
There's going to be research,
and l'm going to be in on it.

01:30:34.112 --> 01:30:37.529
The first thing to do
is take pictures of that one we dug up.

01:30:38.535 --> 01:30:42.403
Yeah. Pictures seem like a good idea.

01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:48.628
Thanks for everything.
Saving my life and stuff.

01:30:51.969 --> 01:30:53.463
You're welcome.

01:30:55.473 --> 01:30:57.348
Maybe l'll see you sometime?

01:31:10.618 --> 01:31:11.697

01:31:17.794 --> 01:31:21.045

01:31:21.757 --> 01:31:23.086
What am l doing?

01:31:23.343 --> 01:31:26.298
What's a woman like her want
with a guy like me?

01:31:26.388 --> 01:31:28.382
She's going for her damn Ph.D.

01:31:33.564 --> 01:31:34.560

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.559
