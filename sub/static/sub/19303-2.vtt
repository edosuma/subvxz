WEBVTT

00:20.772 --> 00:25.443
<i>Well, we know where we're going</i>

00:26.861 --> 00:29.698
<i>But we don't know</i>

00:29.864 --> 00:31.574
<i>Where we've been</i>

00:31.741 --> 00:33.368
<i>And so we ran on...</i>

00:35.412 --> 00:36.830
<i>...into Summerland...</i>

00:36.996 --> 00:38.915
<i>...and the place they said did not exist.</i>

00:39.082 --> 00:43.420
<i>And we know what we're knowing</i>

00:43.586 --> 00:47.924
<i>But we can't say what we've seen</i>

00:48.091 --> 00:51.177
<i>And all the while,
wolves were at our heels.</i>

00:54.389 --> 00:56.766
<i>Black masks, boots...</i>

00:57.684 --> 01:01.146
<i>...and the one they called The Eye.</i>

01:01.312 --> 01:07.277
<i>And we're not little children</i>

01:07.444 --> 01:13.241
<i>And we know what we want</i>

01:13.408 --> 01:17.454
<i>We had come to do the work
that must be done...</i>

01:17.996 --> 01:21.833
<i>...to strip ourselves
of the fog of life before.</i>

01:24.002 --> 01:29.883
The human race is beginning to evolve.

01:32.010 --> 01:35.472
<i>Exterior temperature is 20 degrees Celsius.</i>

01:36.139 --> 01:40.185
<i>Give us time to work it out</i>

01:41.519 --> 01:42.729
<i>David.</i>

01:46.566 --> 01:52.530
<i>We believe, myself and the people
here, that you're a very powerful telepath.</i>

01:57.202 --> 01:58.620
David.

01:58.787 --> 02:01.206
<i>Telekinetic, potentially.</i>

02:03.583 --> 02:06.211
Which means you can control matter
with your mind.

02:09.297 --> 02:10.465
Ah!

02:12.383 --> 02:15.386
The Divisions were created
by our government to track and study people...

02:15.553 --> 02:16.930
<i>...like you and Syd.</i>

02:17.096 --> 02:19.724
<i>And the ones they can't control, they kill.</i>

02:26.981 --> 02:29.025
Are you hearing voices? Now?

02:30.568 --> 02:31.611
They're louder here.

02:32.904 --> 02:34.072
So much power.

02:34.239 --> 02:36.032
It's making you sick.

02:36.866 --> 02:39.536
- I want you to focus on the voices.
- No.

02:39.702 --> 02:41.037
That's what-- That's worse.

02:41.204 --> 02:43.456
Trust me. You're safe here.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.584
Now, close your eyes. Focus.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.380
There's a single voice calling your name.

02:50.547 --> 02:51.548
<i>David?</i>

02:51.714 --> 02:53.550
- Can you hear it?
<i>- David?</i>

02:53.716 --> 02:55.009
Can you find it?

02:55.176 --> 02:56.469
<i>David.</i>

02:58.012 --> 02:59.514
<i>David.</i>

03:00.223 --> 03:02.308
<i>David.</i>

03:03.268 --> 03:04.561
<i>- David.
- Do it!</i>

03:06.938 --> 03:09.190
All right, I want you to concentrate on it.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.400
<i>David.</i>

03:10.567 --> 03:12.694
- Now, dial out all the other voices.
<i>- David.</i>

03:12.861 --> 03:16.781
Imagine there's a big knob,
like a volume knob...

03:16.948 --> 03:19.576
<i>- David.
- ...and just turn it down...</i>

03:19.742 --> 03:22.745
<i>- David.
- ...until all you hear is that one voice.</i>

03:22.912 --> 03:24.497
<i>David?</i>

03:25.957 --> 03:27.333
<i>David.</i>

03:28.042 --> 03:30.086
That's good, David.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.256
Very good.

03:33.423 --> 03:35.925
That's what we call telepathy.

03:37.886 --> 03:39.095
Get some sleep.

03:40.722 --> 03:43.433
Tomorrow memory work begins.

03:54.736 --> 03:57.572
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:57.739 --> 03:58.823
You feeling better?

04:02.869 --> 04:08.458
Um, what did she mean "memory work"?

04:10.209 --> 04:13.254
David, your whole life
people have told you you're sick.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.840
What if I told you that's a lie?

04:16.007 --> 04:19.510
What if I told you every memory you have
of mental illness...

04:19.677 --> 04:22.764
...the voices, hallucinations,
was just your power?

04:23.723 --> 04:26.768
And what if I could do more
than just tell you?

04:27.894 --> 04:30.647
What if I could show you?

04:33.524 --> 04:36.527
Help you rewrite the story of your life.

04:38.738 --> 04:40.490
Do--? Do we have time for that?

04:40.657 --> 04:43.242
- Didn't you say Division Three--?
- We'll make time.

04:49.499 --> 04:52.001
You're very important to us, David.

04:52.502 --> 04:54.087
To me.

04:54.629 --> 04:56.005
I need you clear.

04:56.172 --> 04:58.383
I need you focused.

04:59.717 --> 05:01.469
This is how we do it.

05:02.971 --> 05:04.472
We look back...

05:04.639 --> 05:08.893
...we find your powers,
we see what triggers them.

05:10.937 --> 05:15.400
But what matters most,
we make you whole.

06:03.239 --> 06:04.449
Amy.

06:04.615 --> 06:05.867
Wait up, Amy.

06:18.588 --> 06:19.922
Come on, King.

06:21.257 --> 06:22.842
Come on.

06:30.516 --> 06:33.978
You can see why I said
you need to see this for yourself.

06:36.147 --> 06:38.441
We call this memory work.

06:40.485 --> 06:41.778
Amy.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.780
Your sister.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.742
What was I, like 8? How is it--?

06:47.909 --> 06:50.787
Are we like--? Are we--?
Are we inside my head?

06:50.953 --> 06:53.831
Ptonomy is what we call our memory artist.

06:53.998 --> 06:55.875
That's his gift.

06:57.001 --> 06:59.879
- Can I talk to them?
- You can, but it's better if you don't.

07:00.046 --> 07:01.798
It changes the memory.

07:01.964 --> 07:03.508
Just take it in for now.

07:03.674 --> 07:06.177
This first time is about accepting that it's real.

07:06.344 --> 07:08.346
And then we can focus on work.

07:08.513 --> 07:10.807
Taking you back
to those moments in your past...

07:10.973 --> 07:14.977
...when you first felt
your so-called illness coming on.

07:16.354 --> 07:19.357
I'll show you
that it was really just your gift.

07:23.194 --> 07:25.154
We're gonna make you whole again.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.574
Come on, Davey. Mom said home by 6.

07:28.741 --> 07:31.202
Okay. Come on, King.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.666
Can I--? Can we--? Can we follow them?

07:36.833 --> 07:38.751
Pretend we're in a museum.

07:38.918 --> 07:40.336
The museum of you.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.255
It's your place. You're the boss.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.882
Where do you wanna go?
What do you want to see?

07:45.299 --> 07:46.926
<i>Feel it all again.</i>

07:47.927 --> 07:51.931
<i>- You're back in your body, in the moment.</i>
- King!

07:57.728 --> 07:59.438
King.

07:59.605 --> 08:01.274
- Come on.
- Come on, King.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.611
Heh. No, no, no.

08:05.778 --> 08:07.446
Not like this.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.365
In rows. See?

08:09.532 --> 08:11.492
- Okay.
- And let....

08:13.578 --> 08:15.079
- Yeah?
- All right.

08:15.538 --> 08:16.539
Big one.

08:16.747 --> 08:19.625
<i>And then take a deep breath.</i>

08:19.792 --> 08:22.712
<i>Now, try to see it from the outside.
Find some distance.</i>

08:23.379 --> 08:26.507
- Okay. Stand still.
- I am.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.926
Hey. No cheating.

08:29.093 --> 08:30.928
- Heh, I'm not.
- Right here.

08:31.095 --> 08:34.015
- That's your mother?
- Right there.

08:35.141 --> 08:37.268
I've grown a lot.

08:37.643 --> 08:40.104
We live in the country.

08:40.271 --> 08:44.692
Upstate. There's no, um, light pollution.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.321
My dad...

08:48.779 --> 08:50.364
...he's an astronomer.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.951
He, uh, was.

08:56.913 --> 08:59.582
He-- He died last year.

08:59.749 --> 09:02.752
"'To bed, to bed,' the mother said.

09:02.919 --> 09:05.630
- They wouldn't let me....
- 'To bed,' she said.

09:05.796 --> 09:10.509
- The angry boy, his face turned red.
- I was still in the hospital.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.347
His face turned red."

09:14.972 --> 09:16.891
But why can't I see his face?

09:17.058 --> 09:20.228
You can. This is your memory.
All you have to do is look up.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.313
"His face turned red.

09:22.480 --> 09:26.067
And with a cry, he chopped her head."

09:37.620 --> 09:40.081
"'No bed,' he said.

09:40.706 --> 09:44.335
And snicker snack, his mom was dead.

09:44.502 --> 09:45.962
Dead, dead."

10:05.940 --> 10:08.901
Ahh! No, no, no!

10:10.278 --> 10:11.404
No, I can't.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.406
- No, I-- I can't. No.
- Da--

10:13.572 --> 10:16.492
- I can't. I--
- Hey, now, it's okay.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.869
It's not real. They're just memories.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.622
I felt the same way the first time. Yeah?

10:21.789 --> 10:22.957
Okay. Slow down.

10:23.124 --> 10:25.793
You see these things. You're back there.
These feelings. I did it too.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.337
- How do I get out?
- David. It's all right.

10:28.504 --> 10:29.839
No. How do I--? I just want--

10:30.006 --> 10:31.549
Sleep.

10:53.904 --> 10:57.033
And we both know
who that angry boy was.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.161
We do?

11:00.328 --> 11:01.787
David.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.000
Me?

11:07.460 --> 11:09.003
Very good.

11:13.007 --> 11:14.342
That's, um....

11:14.508 --> 11:18.012
Ahem, I'm not sure that's-- Quiet, I'm talking.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.305
Sorry.

11:19.472 --> 11:21.098
You seem twitchy today.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.100
No. This--

11:23.392 --> 11:24.727
This is me normal.

11:24.894 --> 11:27.313
Everything okay at home?
Your girlfriend?

11:28.439 --> 11:30.024
She's--

11:30.441 --> 11:31.484
We don't--

11:31.650 --> 11:34.320
I don't wanna talk about it, okay? God!

11:34.487 --> 11:38.282
I'm not an easy guy to....

11:40.993 --> 11:43.371
She left. Philly.

11:43.829 --> 11:47.041
No. I-- She wanted to, and--

11:47.208 --> 11:50.002
And lightning, you know? Like, ahem...

11:50.211 --> 11:52.797
Do you--? Do you have any gum?
Or, like, a lozenge?

11:52.963 --> 11:54.799
Or, like, liquid or something?
My mouth--

11:54.965 --> 11:57.593
The breakup of a relationship
can be very disruptive...

11:57.760 --> 12:01.847
...for someone with your condition, David.
Are you sleeping?

12:03.933 --> 12:05.351
At night, you mean?

12:05.518 --> 12:07.686
Uh, yeah. No, I'm fine.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.980
The vapor, and....

12:10.147 --> 12:12.066
I mean, it's not like--

12:12.233 --> 12:15.152
I mean, maybe she'll come back.

12:16.028 --> 12:19.240
I think.
It's kind of our dynamic, you know.

12:19.407 --> 12:21.575
And we talked
about how that's not healthy.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.120
High stress, the push-pull.

12:24.662 --> 12:26.539
What--? What did you mean, "the vapor"?

12:26.705 --> 12:29.125
- The what?
- You said "the vapor."

12:30.251 --> 12:34.422
No, I was just repeating something
the voices said.

12:35.464 --> 12:36.632
I see.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.677
Well, as I said, this dynamic,
always fighting and making up...

12:41.971 --> 12:43.764
...it's not good for your condition, David.

12:43.931 --> 12:47.393
- You need a more settled environment.
- Okay, yeah.

12:48.144 --> 12:50.312
I will work on that.

12:58.654 --> 12:59.822
Hey!

13:02.074 --> 13:04.869
All good in the head now?

13:11.625 --> 13:13.252
What--? What is this?

13:13.419 --> 13:14.879
I thought you might be hungry.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.505
I could whip us up some....

13:16.672 --> 13:18.924
Whatever, eggs.

13:20.301 --> 13:21.635
The Greek?

13:22.720 --> 13:24.847
So is this, like, my stove or...?

13:25.014 --> 13:31.979
Ha! Some girl I finger-banged
took a real shine to me.

13:32.146 --> 13:35.566
She had, like, all these menus
on her fridge, you know...

13:35.733 --> 13:38.110
...so I figured bitch could probably live...

13:38.277 --> 13:40.779
...without stewing any more ragout
or whatever.

13:40.946 --> 13:42.448
<i>David.</i>

13:42.865 --> 13:44.074
<i>David.</i>

13:45.159 --> 13:46.202
<i>David.</i>

13:51.457 --> 13:52.666
Hey.

13:55.961 --> 13:57.713
It's cool.

13:58.589 --> 14:00.216
Drink this.

14:00.758 --> 14:03.260
It's milk. It helps.

14:03.427 --> 14:06.514
<i>Reminder, the dining hall
is a levitation-free zone.</i>

14:06.680 --> 14:08.474
First time is always the worst.

14:08.641 --> 14:10.267
The memory work.

14:10.434 --> 14:12.561
- Your girlfriend threw up.
- Hmm?

14:13.687 --> 14:15.439
Syd.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.317
She's in with Melanie, doing talk work.

14:18.484 --> 14:22.321
That's the deal. Do memory work with me,
you gotta do talk work with Dr. Bird.

14:22.488 --> 14:24.907
Figure out what it all means.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.412
Melanie thinks you're the key.

14:31.413 --> 14:32.748
The key to what?

14:32.915 --> 14:34.708
Winning the war...

14:35.501 --> 14:37.586
...and other things.

14:37.920 --> 14:41.298
<i>Dr. Baker's Advanced Time Travel class
has been canceled.</i>

14:41.966 --> 14:45.135
She called you a memory artist.

14:45.302 --> 14:47.555
Melanie-- You....

14:47.721 --> 14:48.764
That was all you?

14:50.391 --> 14:52.935
That is weirdly impressive.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.647
My pops had a crap memory.

14:56.814 --> 14:59.525
Artillery shell in the war.
Went deaf in one ear.

15:02.069 --> 15:05.322
But then, he was never good with facts
and, like, dates and stuff.

15:05.489 --> 15:09.827
He used to snap his fingers at me
when he forgot my name.

15:10.411 --> 15:14.164
Which is funny,
because I remember everything.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.250
What do you mean, everything?

15:16.417 --> 15:18.752
Like I remember my birth.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.421
Before, even. The womb.

15:20.588 --> 15:23.382
You know how loud the heartbeat is?

15:23.549 --> 15:26.510
Imagine you can remember
being inside your mother's body...

15:26.677 --> 15:30.472
...warm and blind,
and then just this intense pressure...

15:30.639 --> 15:32.391
...and suddenly...

15:34.560 --> 15:35.603
...light.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.479
Tell me about the book.

15:37.938 --> 15:41.317
- What book?
<i>- The World's Angriest Boy in the World.</i>

15:42.359 --> 15:47.197
Oh, I-- I don't know.
I don't-- I don't remember.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.782
Not really.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.910
The memory seemed clear to me.

15:53.370 --> 15:56.999
Was that really...? Did your parents
really read that at bedtime?

15:57.166 --> 15:58.500
Because that would be....

15:59.835 --> 16:01.587
That's messed up.

16:04.340 --> 16:06.884
I don't wanna talk about it.

16:08.218 --> 16:11.305
Mm, I don't either.

16:11.597 --> 16:12.973
That's not my deal.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.018
I'm the memory guy. Not the talk guy.

16:16.727 --> 16:18.896
Take your time getting up.

16:19.521 --> 16:23.275
Like I said, first time's a bitch.

16:26.487 --> 16:30.282
<i>Earth is the only planet in our
solar system not named after a god.</i>

16:47.800 --> 16:49.259
Hi.

16:51.512 --> 16:53.055
Hey.

16:59.728 --> 17:02.690
I don't know how this is helping.

17:03.023 --> 17:07.569
- The memory work.
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:08.570 --> 17:10.698
I thought that too.

17:12.199 --> 17:15.452
When I got here,
all I wanted was to get you.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.419
What did it matter
if my mommy was mean to me?

17:24.128 --> 17:26.380
Or what I saw when I was you.

17:31.009 --> 17:33.721
I still don't really understand it.

17:37.391 --> 17:39.643
There was a flash.

17:41.812 --> 17:44.148
That's all I remember.

17:47.609 --> 17:48.652
We changed places...

17:48.819 --> 17:52.656
...and everything in the dayroom
was so loud.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.535
People yelling.

17:59.997 --> 18:01.623
And the lights.

18:02.750 --> 18:05.210
Drums in my head.

18:05.377 --> 18:08.088
I've never felt that way before. And....

18:10.466 --> 18:12.176
Something else.

18:17.014 --> 18:18.974
Something....

18:23.896 --> 18:25.147
That's when it happened.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.029
David, I think...

18:33.655 --> 18:38.160
...I killed your friend.

18:42.831 --> 18:45.292
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

18:45.459 --> 18:47.211
It's not your fault.

18:48.378 --> 18:49.797
Don't give a newbie a--

18:49.963 --> 18:52.299
--bazooka and act surprised
when she blows shit up.

18:52.466 --> 18:53.550
What?

18:54.468 --> 18:56.470
Nothing. I just....

18:56.637 --> 18:58.722
Well, they heard it.

18:58.889 --> 19:00.808
When I used your power.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.100
<i>Melanie and the others.</i>

19:03.268 --> 19:04.645
<i>They heard it and they came.</i>

19:05.813 --> 19:09.233
<i>And Division Three came
because they heard it too.</i>

19:11.109 --> 19:14.780
<i>They thought they found you.</i>

19:16.114 --> 19:18.200
<i>But it was really me.</i>

19:18.951 --> 19:23.455
<i>And someday
Someday, baby</i>

19:23.622 --> 19:25.123
Surprise.

19:34.675 --> 19:36.218
I--

19:36.552 --> 19:38.595
I wanna hug you.

19:40.973 --> 19:42.182
You can't.

19:43.433 --> 19:46.061
We could hold hands.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.437
- Can I be honest?
- Mm-hmm.

19:47.604 --> 19:49.189
It's really uncomfortable for me.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.608
- Even with the gloves.
- Oh.

19:51.775 --> 19:55.237
There's this feeling.
The closer I get to someone.

19:55.404 --> 19:57.239
It's like being covered with ants.

19:57.823 --> 20:01.618
These little anxious needles
under my skin.

20:01.785 --> 20:04.746
Sometimes it's all I can do not to scream.

20:05.873 --> 20:08.166
Well, we wouldn't want that.

20:08.333 --> 20:09.918
No.

20:10.752 --> 20:13.463
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

20:17.801 --> 20:20.554
We're having a romance of the mind.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.435
I like that.

20:40.407 --> 20:43.410
All right, Mr. Haller, try not to sneeze.

20:43.577 --> 20:44.995
Why would I sneeze?

20:47.623 --> 20:49.291
Well, for example.

20:49.458 --> 20:51.710
Move, basically.

20:51.877 --> 20:54.379
It-- It jumbles the scan.

20:59.051 --> 21:00.594
Apple.

21:02.638 --> 21:03.931
Nixon.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.974
Uh, onion.

21:06.141 --> 21:07.559
No. Onion.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.728
- Santa.
- Are you talking to me?

21:09.895 --> 21:11.563
No, I'm not. Sorry.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.690
Alaska.

21:13.857 --> 21:17.152
Ah, no, you don't play like this. Shh.

21:19.821 --> 21:22.449
I talk to myself sometimes too.

21:22.616 --> 21:26.036
Well, not myself. The-- The voices.

21:26.203 --> 21:27.913
You're supposed to ignore them.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.290
- Sometimes--
- Also, don't talk.

21:30.457 --> 21:33.335
Sorry.
On the list of things not to do. Talk.

21:33.502 --> 21:35.420
Oh, like sneeze?

21:36.046 --> 21:37.798
- Do you have to sneeze?
- No. Just....

21:40.217 --> 21:43.428
For the record, I wasn't talking to myself.
I was talking to Kerry.

21:43.595 --> 21:45.555
Wait, I thought your name was Cary.

21:45.722 --> 21:46.723
Yes, it is.

21:46.890 --> 21:50.185
So you're talking to Cary, just not
the Cary that happens to be yourself.

21:50.352 --> 21:53.480
Correct.
You have an extremely large amygdala.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.482
Thank you.

21:55.649 --> 21:56.984
Okay.

21:57.150 --> 22:03.573
Deep breath.
Try to think of something or someone you...

22:04.282 --> 22:05.325
...love.

22:10.914 --> 22:12.791
<i>Is he okay?</i>

22:14.918 --> 22:16.670
<i>Don't worry, I can walk.</i>

22:17.838 --> 22:21.049
He gets back into town on Thursday.

22:21.717 --> 22:23.468
I think he's gonna propose.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.183
David.

22:33.228 --> 22:35.147
Oh, that's....

22:36.898 --> 22:38.525
Good job.

22:39.151 --> 22:41.028
Good job?

22:41.653 --> 22:43.363
No, I-- That's-- That's great.

22:43.530 --> 22:47.075
I'm-- I'm happy for you.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.578
You're sweet, but....

22:50.037 --> 22:52.539
I mean, I don't know for sure.

22:52.873 --> 22:53.999
Men, right?

22:55.500 --> 22:59.254
But who knows? Maybe you and Philly.

23:02.716 --> 23:05.802
You know, she's nice, though, you know?

23:06.678 --> 23:09.639
I think she-- She gets you.

23:18.315 --> 23:21.109
No, that-- That's-- That's dumb.

23:21.276 --> 23:23.070
- I'm-- That's not gonna....
- Well...

23:23.820 --> 23:28.867
...why can't you have a--?
What everyone else has?

23:29.034 --> 23:32.245
A nice home, a family.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.582
Because I'm sick.

23:46.051 --> 23:48.595
The point of a stove being what?

23:49.554 --> 23:51.848
- Like its function?
- To me.

23:52.015 --> 23:54.184
I look like a guy who needs a stove?

23:54.351 --> 23:59.606
You know how in baseball they say,
"So-and-so's a utility player"?

23:59.773 --> 24:03.235
The stove
is the utility player of the modern home.

24:03.401 --> 24:07.322
You know, you can cook with it,
you can heat a room with it...

24:07.489 --> 24:09.950
...you can read by it.

24:10.117 --> 24:13.203
Some of your finer poets
even knock themselves off...

24:13.370 --> 24:16.790
...with the old
"head in the oven" scenario.

24:17.290 --> 24:19.334
You're saying I should kill myself?

24:20.544 --> 24:25.215
Dude, look,
I don't, um, care what you do with it.

24:25.382 --> 24:28.969
I'm just trying to trade a kitchen range
for some drugs.

24:29.136 --> 24:30.762
That's all.

24:31.555 --> 24:33.640
We could go by weight....

24:39.771 --> 24:40.897
Kid.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.817
Mazel tov.

25:05.088 --> 25:06.256
Why is it blue?

25:07.424 --> 25:09.593
It's always blue.

25:12.220 --> 25:14.014
Oh, yeah.

25:21.062 --> 25:23.648
Hey, we should, um....
You know that doctor that you see?

25:23.815 --> 25:25.859
Does he have any good--?

25:26.026 --> 25:28.403
You've been to his place, right?
Is it, like, fancy?

25:28.570 --> 25:30.989
- You mean Dr. Poole?
- Yeah.

25:31.156 --> 25:32.407
His, um....

25:32.574 --> 25:36.620
I'm asking because I was thinking
maybe, like, one night, you know...

25:36.786 --> 25:40.248
...when he's not there,
we could, like, slip in and....

25:40.415 --> 25:42.292
Because that could be....

25:44.336 --> 25:47.339
I'm asking,
it's got great score potential, you know.

25:47.505 --> 25:49.257
And I'm saying like action movie...

25:49.424 --> 25:52.469
..."one last job and I'm out" type of thing.
You know?

25:53.845 --> 25:55.347
- Lenny.
- What?

26:31.633 --> 26:34.344
Red leather, yellow leather.

26:34.511 --> 26:39.140
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather.

26:43.436 --> 26:44.479
Freeze.

26:47.065 --> 26:49.025
What just happened?

26:49.276 --> 26:50.777
Nothing.

26:51.236 --> 26:54.781
Your reaction to Lenny, what were
you seeing when you looked at her?

26:54.948 --> 26:57.367
Nothing. We were high, okay.

26:57.534 --> 26:58.910
I-- I see things, okay?

26:59.077 --> 27:01.663
It's not real. It's my brain.

27:01.830 --> 27:04.082
That's the old narrative, son.

27:04.249 --> 27:06.042
The schizophrenic delusions.

27:06.209 --> 27:08.503
You're not schizophrenic.

27:09.129 --> 27:10.171
You have powers.

27:10.338 --> 27:12.507
The things you see are real.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.509
Like I showed you with the voices.

27:15.760 --> 27:16.886
Which reminds me.

27:17.053 --> 27:19.389
I'd like to go back to something else.

27:19.556 --> 27:21.725
Quiet, I'm talking. Sorry.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.643
You seem twitchy today.

27:23.810 --> 27:27.022
Nope. Nope, this is me normal.

27:27.188 --> 27:28.773
Everything okay at home?

27:28.940 --> 27:30.400
Your girlfriend?

27:30.567 --> 27:34.029
We don't-- I'm not an easy guy to....

27:34.195 --> 27:36.614
She left. Philly.

27:38.992 --> 27:42.162
No. I-- She wanted to and--
And lightning, you know?

27:42.329 --> 27:44.039
Freeze.

27:44.205 --> 27:46.124
What happened there?

27:46.333 --> 27:47.625
I don't know.

27:47.792 --> 27:49.377
You saw it?

27:49.544 --> 27:52.881
- There was a glitch, a time jump.
- Yes.

27:53.048 --> 27:56.634
David, it's very important
that you remember everything.

27:56.801 --> 27:59.721
I am. I do. I will.
Maybe I was distracted or--

27:59.888 --> 28:02.223
No. Even if you were focused on
something else...

28:02.390 --> 28:04.434
...the surrounding memory
should be intact.

28:04.601 --> 28:07.270
It's okay to be confused.

28:07.437 --> 28:09.606
We'll find the truth together.

28:10.357 --> 28:11.775
Take us back.

28:14.110 --> 28:17.530
She left. Philly.

28:18.490 --> 28:21.659
No. I-- She wanted to and....

28:22.369 --> 28:24.120
Something happened, and....

28:25.497 --> 28:26.956
Lightning, you know?

28:27.123 --> 28:30.377
- Do you have any gum or, like, a--?
- Wait.

28:31.044 --> 28:33.046
There was a flash. Did you see that?

28:33.630 --> 28:36.549
You were in a kitchen.
Maybe six years ago?

28:36.716 --> 28:38.968
You were using your powers.

28:39.511 --> 28:41.763
I don't know. I didn't see anything.

28:41.930 --> 28:46.101
Concentrate. Try and focus
on where you went just now.

28:46.476 --> 28:49.562
An apartment.
There was some kind of an incident.

28:50.230 --> 28:52.774
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

28:56.528 --> 28:59.322
Just make your mind blank...

28:59.906 --> 29:01.991
...and I'll get us there.

29:13.211 --> 29:15.004
What happened?

29:15.171 --> 29:17.257
I don't know. I couldn't....

29:25.849 --> 29:27.684
He's too strong.

29:27.851 --> 29:29.769
It's not me. I didn't--

29:29.936 --> 29:32.397
- David. You have to trust us.
- I do.

29:32.564 --> 29:33.982
I told you.

29:35.984 --> 29:37.861
David?

29:39.821 --> 29:41.448
David?

30:10.268 --> 30:11.811
<i>David.</i>

30:15.023 --> 30:16.733
<i>David.</i>

30:17.734 --> 30:18.943
<i>David.</i>

30:20.778 --> 30:22.530
What?

30:22.697 --> 30:24.657
- I said, how are you?
- Oh. Heh.

30:24.824 --> 30:28.536
Um, ahem, I'm fine.

30:28.703 --> 30:30.663
Just, you know....

30:30.830 --> 30:33.583
- It's a lot to take in.
- I know.

30:35.251 --> 30:37.086
I was worried.

30:38.421 --> 30:40.131
Yeah.

30:41.424 --> 30:43.426
What was it? In the memory.

30:43.593 --> 30:45.512
- Melanie won't tell me.
- Ah....

30:46.888 --> 30:48.973
It was kid stuff.

30:57.482 --> 31:00.360
It's okay, though, that I brought you here?

31:00.610 --> 31:03.488
Yeah, of course. Are you kidding?
This place is beautiful.

31:09.077 --> 31:10.578
You think we're safe here?

31:12.497 --> 31:14.207
Right now.

31:14.958 --> 31:16.626
But I know they're looking for us.

31:17.752 --> 31:20.213
To experiment on or....

31:22.257 --> 31:23.424
<i>But I'll protect you.</i>

31:23.591 --> 31:24.842
What?

31:25.009 --> 31:27.887
- Huh?
- No, you said--

31:28.054 --> 31:29.639
I thought you--

31:30.557 --> 31:32.225
Never mind.

31:32.725 --> 31:35.520
- No, what?
- No, nothing. I just....

31:36.187 --> 31:40.483
Did you just think--? In your head,
did you think, "I'll protect you"?

31:42.235 --> 31:43.653
No. I don't know.

31:43.820 --> 31:45.989
Sorry, I'm-- I'm not listening.

31:46.155 --> 31:49.993
- I just-- I can't control it yet.
- Well, learn.

31:50.493 --> 31:53.162
Because not everything is--

31:53.329 --> 31:55.206
No, I know. Just....

31:58.209 --> 32:00.211
<i>You are cute, though.</i>

32:03.423 --> 32:05.174
<i>David.</i>

32:06.467 --> 32:08.136
You're moving.

32:08.303 --> 32:10.346
I told you not to.

32:11.014 --> 32:13.099
I'm sorry. It's just--

32:13.266 --> 32:14.976
How much longer?

32:15.143 --> 32:18.062
A couple of-- Let's, uh....

32:18.229 --> 32:21.816
We're just trying to figure out
where all your memories are stored.

32:22.567 --> 32:26.321
We're trying to map the network.

32:28.489 --> 32:31.242
Now, think about what happened next.

32:34.329 --> 32:35.872
And this sense you have...

32:36.039 --> 32:38.958
...of seeing another world
out of the corner of your eye...

32:39.125 --> 32:40.501
...when did that start?

32:40.668 --> 32:45.048
Uh, maybe 10 or 11.

32:45.423 --> 32:48.134
<i>One last job, and we're out.</i>

32:48.926 --> 32:51.095
It's kind of hard to....

32:53.056 --> 32:56.184
Like trying to make a list,
people yelling in your ear.

32:56.351 --> 32:57.602
<i>Big score potential.</i>

32:57.769 --> 33:00.355
The pills I prescribed
should help with that.

33:00.521 --> 33:03.775
They do. Some.

33:03.941 --> 33:05.818
<i>It's always blue.</i>

33:05.985 --> 33:08.571
- You're not supplementing, are you?
- What do you mean?

33:08.738 --> 33:12.200
Last time you used the word "vapor,"
I looked it up. There's a new drug.

33:12.367 --> 33:13.618
No. I don't.

33:13.785 --> 33:15.578
The pills. The prescription.

33:15.745 --> 33:16.788
I'm clean.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.290
Ten or 11...

33:19.457 --> 33:22.752
- Hmm?
- ...you said the visions started.

33:23.002 --> 33:25.129
What do you remember most
about those years?

33:25.838 --> 33:31.052
Uh, well, uh....

33:32.178 --> 33:34.055
Andromeda...

33:35.723 --> 33:37.725
...Cassiopeia...

33:39.560 --> 33:43.731
...Boötes, Canis Major, Lupus. Uh, heh....

33:45.650 --> 33:47.568
Telescopia....

33:50.113 --> 33:51.698
In the sky.

33:51.864 --> 33:54.075
My dad was a....

33:56.202 --> 34:02.041
My father was a-- He studied the, uh, stars.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.585
- An astronomer.
- Yes.

34:04.752 --> 34:10.925
And he used to wake me up
in the middle of the....

34:11.092 --> 34:12.719
And....

34:13.428 --> 34:16.931
<i>We'd drive out in his truck to....</i>

34:19.767 --> 34:24.230
And I'd look up at the lights in the sky
and...

34:27.233 --> 34:29.026
...they'd talk to me.

34:29.193 --> 34:30.319
The stars.

34:30.486 --> 34:33.698
Which was....
I thought they talked to everybody.

34:33.865 --> 34:38.578
And I told my dad and he said--
At first he said, "They talk to me too."

34:38.911 --> 34:42.623
But he meant it like a metaphor.

34:42.790 --> 34:45.251
And what did the stars say?

34:56.971 --> 34:59.223
No. That's....

35:01.642 --> 35:04.896
I'm not--
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

35:05.563 --> 35:08.191
This is a safe place, David.
Nothing can hurt you here.

35:10.193 --> 35:12.320
No, I'm-- I'm fine. I just....

35:17.450 --> 35:18.493
Wait, we should, uh....

35:20.620 --> 35:22.955
Let's talk about something else, okay?
Uh....

35:30.922 --> 35:32.924
What did you say
that article was about?

35:33.090 --> 35:35.343
A new, uh, drug or something?

35:39.722 --> 35:42.975
It's just a closet, David.
Nothing to worry about.

35:50.024 --> 35:53.528
Hmm? You see?

35:53.820 --> 35:55.613
Nothing to worry about.

36:01.244 --> 36:02.745
So...

36:03.621 --> 36:05.998
...why don't you tell me
what the stars said?

36:07.917 --> 36:09.210
<i>David.</i>

36:10.670 --> 36:12.255
What?

36:12.880 --> 36:14.465
I didn't say anything.

36:14.632 --> 36:15.925
No, is...?

36:16.092 --> 36:17.677
It sounded like a woman.

36:18.386 --> 36:19.679
I didn't--

36:19.846 --> 36:21.597
Did you say something?

36:22.390 --> 36:25.101
- No.
- She says she didn't say anything.

36:25.268 --> 36:28.062
- Who?
- Kerry.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.939
I thought your name was--

36:30.106 --> 36:34.110
Look, can we--? Are we--? Are we done?

36:34.277 --> 36:35.528
Because I-- I gotta--

36:35.695 --> 36:39.156
We're almost done, all right?

36:41.576 --> 36:44.203
<i>David. Where are you?</i>

36:44.370 --> 36:45.830
Amy?

36:47.707 --> 36:49.542
<i>David.</i>

36:54.881 --> 36:57.425
<i>I told you. David Haller.</i>

36:57.592 --> 36:59.760
<i>H-A-L-L-E-R.</i>

36:59.927 --> 37:01.429
As I said on the phone...

37:01.596 --> 37:04.307
...we've never had a David Haller
at this facility.

37:04.473 --> 37:06.350
Well, that's just crazy.

37:06.517 --> 37:08.269
We don't use that word here.

37:08.436 --> 37:11.022
I don't know what other word to use.

37:11.188 --> 37:13.983
Mrs. Haller, if your brother was here--

37:14.150 --> 37:15.276
He was.

37:15.443 --> 37:17.528
<i>Then there would be a record.</i>

37:17.778 --> 37:21.949
Look, I don't know anything
about your records.

37:22.116 --> 37:24.410
I've been to this hospital
a hundred times.

37:24.577 --> 37:27.288
I've been visiting him for years.

37:27.455 --> 37:29.040
Do you understand?

37:29.206 --> 37:34.253
- I-- I sat in that room. I met with his doctor.
- This Kissinger you mentioned....

37:34.420 --> 37:36.589
Yes. Dr. Kissinger.

37:36.756 --> 37:37.840
Douglas. Dennis.

37:38.799 --> 37:42.136
Kissinger.
He worked with David for nearly two years...

37:42.303 --> 37:45.473
...and they were making progress.
Real progress.

37:46.933 --> 37:48.517
Oh, let me guess.

37:49.060 --> 37:51.020
You don't have any record of him either.

37:51.187 --> 37:54.315
Perhaps you have us confused
with another facility.

37:56.609 --> 37:58.277
Is someone putting you up to this?

37:59.862 --> 38:02.031
Are you being coerced?

38:02.198 --> 38:03.616
Miss Haller...

38:03.783 --> 38:07.370
...I'm beginning to wonder
if we shouldn't admit you for observation.

38:07.536 --> 38:09.038
- What?
- Tell me...

38:09.205 --> 38:13.042
...have you ever seen a psychiatrist
for paranoid delusions?

38:27.223 --> 38:28.808
Amy.

38:32.103 --> 38:33.771
<i>Amy!</i>

38:35.773 --> 38:37.400
David?

38:38.317 --> 38:39.986
<i>Amy!</i>

38:42.405 --> 38:43.531
<i>Amy!</i>

38:44.699 --> 38:48.202
David, what--? What just happened?

38:48.744 --> 38:49.996
What?

38:50.162 --> 38:53.916
Your brain just lit up.
There's all kinds of neural activity.

38:55.209 --> 38:57.962
I've never seen anything
like this, really. It's--

38:59.797 --> 39:01.882
- That wasn't a memory.
- I just....

39:02.425 --> 39:04.427
I just heard my sister.

39:05.219 --> 39:06.554
Hey, don't move.

39:06.721 --> 39:08.347
- What?
- I gotta-- Don't move.

39:08.514 --> 39:10.266
I'll be right back.

39:11.267 --> 39:12.893
Did you--?

39:13.227 --> 39:15.104
Did you leave?

39:17.982 --> 39:19.567
Hello?

39:22.111 --> 39:23.237
Hello?

39:29.702 --> 39:31.203
Hello?

39:35.916 --> 39:36.959
Shit.

39:55.561 --> 39:58.064
Oh, come on.

39:58.856 --> 40:00.274
Okay.

40:00.441 --> 40:02.610
I am-- I'm done with this shit.

40:20.002 --> 40:21.253
No!

40:32.473 --> 40:33.682
Yeah, see?

40:33.849 --> 40:36.185
- Check it out, look!
- Oh, my God!

40:36.352 --> 40:39.188
- Look at this. Do you see this? Come on.
- Oh, my God.

40:39.355 --> 40:41.315
- Come over here.
- Check it out.

40:43.317 --> 40:45.194
You guys gotta check this out.

40:49.615 --> 40:50.616
Look at this.

41:02.419 --> 41:03.879
<i>David Haller.</i>

41:04.046 --> 41:08.050
<i>- H-A-L-L-E-R.
- As I said....</i>

41:11.011 --> 41:15.266
<i>- They have her. Division Three.
- They probably do.</i>

41:17.393 --> 41:19.353
<i>You can't help her.</i>

41:23.691 --> 41:24.900
<i>I have to go.</i>

41:34.034 --> 41:35.744
<i>Elevator going up.</i>

41:44.253 --> 41:45.546
<i>Ascending.</i>

41:45.713 --> 41:47.965
- You're leaving.
- Just for a day or two.

41:48.132 --> 41:49.633
Is it me?

41:49.800 --> 41:51.760
Because of me?

41:52.094 --> 41:53.679
We can hold hands.

41:53.846 --> 41:56.682
- I want to.
- Syd, I--

41:58.559 --> 42:04.732
I was in the machine, the MRI,
and I saw Amy.

42:04.940 --> 42:07.610
You saw your sister in the MRI machine?

42:07.776 --> 42:11.071
No. She-- I found her.

42:11.238 --> 42:13.824
I heard her, and she's looking for me.

42:13.991 --> 42:16.243
And they-- I think they found her.

42:16.410 --> 42:18.329
Division Three.

42:18.495 --> 42:20.289
She's in trouble.

42:20.456 --> 42:22.750
I don't know. I can't--

42:22.917 --> 42:24.919
It-- It's jumbled up.

42:25.085 --> 42:28.422
There is something wrong with me, I know,
but I cannot just leave her.

42:28.589 --> 42:29.673
Stay.

42:31.634 --> 42:33.093
Do the work.

42:34.428 --> 42:41.018
Not long. Just enough,
to learn what you can do...

42:41.435 --> 42:44.521
...what we can do together.

42:45.105 --> 42:47.650
Then we can rescue her
like we rescued you.

42:51.528 --> 42:53.447
Do the work.

43:01.413 --> 43:03.374
Well, how do I know they won't kill her?

43:05.417 --> 43:07.836
Because she's bait.

43:30.734 --> 43:33.362
- Down.
<i>- Descending.</i>

44:41.472 --> 44:43.599
Shall we begin?

44:51.357 --> 44:54.526
- Mm!
- Tell me about your childhood.

45:03.452 --> 45:04.953
<i>Oh</i>

45:05.621 --> 45:09.917
<i>At the tender age of 3
I was hooked to a machine</i>

45:10.084 --> 45:14.546
<i>Just to keep my mouth
From spouting junk, ha</i>

45:14.713 --> 45:16.715
<i>Must have took me for a fool</i>

45:16.882 --> 45:19.051
<i>'Cause they chucked me
Out of school</i>

45:19.218 --> 45:23.430
<i>'Cause the teacher knew
I had the funk</i>

45:23.597 --> 45:28.018
<i>But tonight I'm on the edge
You better shut me in the fridge</i>

45:28.185 --> 45:32.689
<i>Because I'm burning up, ha
I'm burning up</i>

45:32.856 --> 45:37.277
<i>With the vision in my brain
And the music in my veins</i>

45:37.444 --> 45:41.698
<i>And the dirty rhythm in my blood</i>

45:41.865 --> 45:45.327
<i>They are messing with my heart</i>

45:46.286 --> 45:50.833
<i>And they're messing with my heart</i>

45:50.999 --> 45:55.129
<i>And they're messing with my heart</i>

45:55.295 --> 45:59.967
<i>Won't stop messing with my
Oh, ripping me apart</i>

46:00.134 --> 46:04.471
<i>Hyperactive when I'm small
Hyperactive now I'm tall</i>

46:04.638 --> 46:09.059
<i>Hyperactive as the day is long</i>

46:09.226 --> 46:11.311
<i>Hyperactive in my bones</i>

46:11.478 --> 46:13.522
<i>Hyperactive in your phones</i>

46:13.689 --> 46:17.943
<i>Hyperactive and the night is young</i>
