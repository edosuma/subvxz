Turn this thing off.

02:01.880 --> 02:05.520
- You're Pusher, I presume.
- You must be Frank Burst.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.759
You know, I gotta tell you.
You got the greatest name.

02:08.840 --> 02:12.120
Agent Collins, read him his rights
and let's get him out of here.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.160
You have the right
to remain silent.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.840
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

02:16.960 --> 02:20.240
- Think you’re gonna hold me ?
- I want him in a waist chain
and leg irons.

02:20.320 --> 02:24.480
I want him in a car with a cage.
Loudoun County unit whatever.
I'll ride shotgun.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.960
You know, it'd really help me out
if you gave us your name.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.040
Pusher is good enough.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.960
You know, Deputy,
I just gotta say...

02:47.080 --> 02:49.640
that your uniform is really
the most soothing shade of blue.

02:51.840 --> 02:55.840
I'm not kidding you.
I notice those things. It's a sky blue.

03:00.760 --> 03:03.680
Very calming.
Very tranquil.

03:05.240 --> 03:09.560
I think the word for that particular
shade is "cerulean, "actually.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.640
Cerulean blue.

03:12.720 --> 03:16.400
- Okay, we get it.
It's a nice shade of blue.
- Cerulean blue.

03:16.480 --> 03:20.520
Cerulean makes me
think of a breeze,

03:20.640 --> 03:23.080
a gentle breeze.

03:23.160 --> 03:28.520
- Hey, Mr. Blackwell, put a sock in it.
- Cerulean is a gentle breeze.

03:28.600 --> 03:32.640
Cerulean, a gentle breeze.

- [Horn Blaring]
- Stop !

04:10.800 --> 04:14.280
[Burst] When the truck hit us
I was knocked unconscious.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.920
Deputy Scott Kerber
was mortally injured.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.959
Before he succumbed, he managed
to pull himself out of the car,

04:20.040 --> 04:22.960
dig his keys
out of his pocket,

04:23.040 --> 04:26.960
and his last breath was spent
unlocking my prisoner...

04:27.040 --> 04:31.480
who, despite his own injuries,
managed to escape on foot.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.040
He calls himself Pusher.

04:34.120 --> 04:37.200
- What's his story ?
- He cold-called me about a month ago.

04:37.280 --> 04:41.400
He confessed to a series
of contract killings going back
over the course of two years.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.880
- He wanted to turn himself in ?
- No.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.280
It was a game.
He was bragging.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.960
See, the thing about these murders
is nobody considers them murders.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.720
They went down
in the books as suicides.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.480
- So you think he was just a crank ?
- No.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.640
He knows too much
about each case,

04:58.720 --> 05:02.080
too many details that were
only in the police reports.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.600
What connection did this
dead deputy have with him ?

05:04.680 --> 05:08.480
None, as far as I can tell.
Kerber was a good cop.

05:08.560 --> 05:11.440
Then why did he free him ?

05:14.280 --> 05:17.560
Pusher kept rambling
about cerulean blue--

05:17.640 --> 05:22.600
kept saying how it reminded him
of a breeze or something.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.600
"Cerulean blue
is like a gentle breeze."

05:25.680 --> 05:29.120
Over and over.

05:29.200 --> 05:33.040
And then Kerber pulled
into the truck and blammo.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.280
So you think that Pusher
somehow talked him into doing this ?

05:36.360 --> 05:40.200
- He willed him into doing that ?
- Willed him ? How ?

05:40.280 --> 05:42.200
No kidding.
How ?

05:44.240 --> 05:46.720
You’re guess is as good as mine
on this one.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.440
See, Pusher
likes to leave clues.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.440
- " Ronin."
- Ronin.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.720
It's a samurai
without a master.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.480
- What, you never saw Yojimbo ?
- Still, what does it mean ?

06:18.520 --> 06:22.080
It means I bet I know ten to one
what this guy's got stacked
on the back of his toilet.

06:27.960 --> 06:31.160
- Agents, here's volume ten.
- Oh, thanks.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.960
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help noticing.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.000
I was in Georgetown
this weekend.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.000
A guy knocked me down
and stole my purse.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.840
- They get him ?
- Do they ever?

06:42.880 --> 06:45.120
No offense.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.120
Excuse me.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.960
Mulder, I'm still not sure
what we're looking for.

06:54.040 --> 06:58.160
- Samurais without masters
have to advertise.
- Yes, but advertise for what ?

06:58.240 --> 07:00.760
I mean, how--
How did this Pusher...

07:00.880 --> 07:06.200
convince an otherwise honest
deputy sheriff to free him ?

07:06.280 --> 07:08.240
I mean, I'm sure
you have a theory.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.240
Suggestion
is a powerful force.

07:10.280 --> 07:13.600
The science of hypnosis is predicated
on it as are most TV commercials.

07:13.680 --> 07:16.080
I mean, they're designed
to plant thoughts in your head.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.600
Inducing someone to buy hair color
is a little different...

07:18.680 --> 07:21.000
than inducing them to drive
in front of a speeding truck.

07:21.080 --> 07:25.080
But the mechanism of suggestion
is the same. It’s just a lot
more powerful in this case.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.600
I mean, this guy
calls himself Pusher.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.560
Can't we take that to mean that he
pushes his will onto other people ?

07:30.600 --> 07:32.560
Well, even if he could
push his will,

07:32.680 --> 07:35.960
why would he cause an accident
when he himself was in the car ?

07:36.040 --> 07:39.840
Maybe he really
didn't want to go to jail.

07:41.960 --> 07:45.000

Agent Mulder, does the F.B.I.
believe that this defendant...

14:28.560 --> 14:31.000
is responsible
for 1 4 murders ?

14:31.080 --> 14:34.160
That is correct,
Your Honor.

14:34.240 --> 14:38.320
Well, in each of the cases,
the coroner's office ruled suicide.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.000
We believe that they
were indeed murders, Your Honor.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.280
You believe ?

14:43.360 --> 14:46.640
- But do you have any evidence ?
- We have the defendant on audiotape...

14:46.720 --> 14:49.640
confessing to the murders
on several separate occasions--

14:49.720 --> 14:51.640
he clearly identifies
them as such.

14:51.720 --> 14:54.000
Furthermore, the defendant
knows crime scene details...

14:54.080 --> 14:56.080
that were only available
to the police.

14:56.200 --> 15:01.360
Your Honor, one of these
so-called murder victims threw
herself under a commuter train.

15:01.440 --> 15:05.320
This was a crowded platform.
A hundred witnesses. Nobody pushed her.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.560
No one was
within30 feet of her.

15:07.640 --> 15:11.080
- But your client was present.
- Which is how he knew your
crime scene details.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.960
- Make your point, Agent Mulder.
- I believe that these people died...

15:14.040 --> 15:18.800
because it was the defendant's
express will that they do so.

15:18.880 --> 15:23.360
- His will ?
- This man admitted to being
a killer for hire.

15:23.440 --> 15:26.560
I believe he has a unique suggestive
ability which makes for the perfect M.O.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.280
He is able to talk his victims
into injuring themselves.

Your Honor, the evidence chain
to this case has been rather
difficult to establish.

We're asking the court's indulgence
while we complete our investigation...

held for trial...

of every case, Your Honor.

16:18.280 --> 16:23.760
And Robert deeply regrets the distress
and confusion this situation has caused.

16:23.840 --> 16:26.280
Do you deny these charges ?

16:28.120 --> 16:31.960
Absolutely, Your Honor.
I'm not guilty.

I made you look.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.400
How do you do it ?

17:17.040 --> 17:18.960
Hey, Modell.

17:20.119 --> 17:22.079
I know your name now.

17:22.119 --> 17:25.200
I know where you live.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.800
I dug up a few more things
on our Robert Patrick Modell.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.800
Let me guess.
He was an average student.

17:55.880 --> 17:59.360
He attended
an average community college.
He did an average stint in the military.

17:59.440 --> 18:01.480
- Which branch of service ?
- Not his first choice.

18:01.560 --> 18:05.400
He wanted to be a Navy Seal
and then he wanted to be an Army
Special Forces, Green Beret.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.280
Promptly washed out of both,
though not for lack of intelligence.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.560
He ended up being
a supply clerk at Fort Bragg.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.760
Served two years,
general discharge.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.800
Did you know that he applied
to the F.B.I. ?

18:15.920 --> 18:19.840
- He didn't even come close
to passing the psych screening.
- You got a copy of that ?

18:19.920 --> 18:24.360
Yeah. They found him to be
"acutely ego-centered."

18:24.440 --> 18:26.360
He has no regard
for the feelings of others,

18:26.440 --> 18:28.360
instead perceiving
people as objects.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.760
He is extremely suspicious
of governments and authority.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.960
Yet he wants
to be in authority.

18:34.040 --> 18:37.440
The screener caught him in a dozen
self-aggrandizing lies.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.440
Saying that he was a master
of martial arts,

18:39.520 --> 18:43.000
that he had been trained by Gurk has
in Nepal and ninjas in Japan.

18:43.080 --> 18:47.000
And ninjas are said to have the ability
to cloud the minds of their opponents.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.600
Now, are we talking
kung fu movies, Mulder ?

18:49.680 --> 18:51.680
He certainly clouded the mind
of that judge, Scully.

18:51.800 --> 18:55.120
Even if Modell could, he didn't need to.
We barely had a case.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.160
Oh, we had enough to get past
a simple preliminary hearing.

18:58.240 --> 19:01.120
Modell psyched the guy out.
He put the "whammy" on him.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.680
Please explain to me
the scientific nature of the "whammy."

19:03.760 --> 19:07.280
I don't know. Maybe it's some mental
aspect of some Eastern martial art.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.920
You know, the temporary suppression
of the brain's chemistry...

19:10.000 --> 19:12.400
produced by a specific timbre
or cadence in Modell's voice.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.400
His voice
seems to be the key.

19:14.480 --> 19:19.400
Mulder, Modell's last known employment
was as a convenience store clerk.

19:19.480 --> 19:23.600
He has never been trained by ninjas.
He has never even been out of the U.S.

19:23.680 --> 19:27.440
He is just a little man who wishes
that he were someone big.

19:27.520 --> 19:29.600
And we're feeding that wish.

19:29.680 --> 19:34.480
That failed psych screening, if Modell
could actually control people's minds,

19:34.520 --> 19:36.600
right now he'd be
an F.B.I. agent, right ?

19:36.680 --> 19:39.120
He'd be a Green Beret,
a Navy Seal.

19:39.200 --> 19:43.800
Maybe the ability came to him more
recently, like in the last two years.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.440
Well, okay.
What's your big theory ?

19:46.520 --> 19:48.440

that I believe that Modell
is guilty of murder ?

19:59.320 --> 20:04.680
I do. I'm just looking for
an explanation a little more
mundane than the "whammy."

You're dying,
aren’t you, Bob ?

What, do you want to take a few innocent
people with you before you go ?

31:29.680 --> 31:32.160
Biology tells us
we’re all dying,

31:32.240 --> 31:35.280
and original sin tells me
ain't nobody innocent.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.960
Yeah, and some are more innocent
than others. Why don't you just
tell me where you are ?

31:39.040 --> 31:42.200
You want the phone number?

31:42.280 --> 31:48.040
Sure, just, uh--
It's 555-01 97.

31:48.120 --> 31:50.120
You know, it's just a payphone.
In two minutes, I'll be gone.

[ Line Clicks ]

32:06.160 --> 32:10.400
- Where's Modell calling from ?
- A gas station parking lot.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.440
1 200 block, Chain Bridge Road.

32:12.480 --> 32:16.120
It’s payphone,
just like he said.

Fairfax Mercy Hospital is right down
the street from there, huh ?

[ Whispering ]
Fairfax Mercy Pharmacy.

32:27.360 --> 32:29.800
" Fairfax Mercy Pharmacy."

32:29.880 --> 32:32.320
He must need regular
treatment, Mulder.

[ Man On Radio ]
We found Modell's car.

33:08.480 --> 33:12.240
The engine's still warm.
He's probably in the building.

covered. Do we hold or goin ?

33:15.480 --> 33:17.440
Hold.

33:18.840 --> 33:21.080
- Hold.
-[Man On Radio] Roger.

33:21.160 --> 33:25.680
The outpatient office says
Modell is scheduled for a 2:30 M.R.I.
That's right now.

33:27.240 --> 33:30.400
- How do you want to play this ?
- I think I should go in alone.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.640
- Why ?
- My team can flush him out.

33:32.720 --> 33:36.960
What if Modell turns one
of your men against the others
in a crowded hospital ?

33:39.480 --> 33:43.320
- I think we should
give him what he wants.
- You.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.720
We stand a better chance
if we’re separated.

33:45.800 --> 33:49.640
I'll go in miked. That way
you’ll know what he’s doing,
where he is at all times.

33:51.240 --> 33:53.480
You got a radio, something
to keep my hands free ?

- Looks like the guard
shot the technician,

- Over here ?

36:25.160 --> 36:27.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right there.

There. That light mass
in his temporal lobe.

Right here.

36:34.280 --> 36:36.200
You were right, Mulder.

36:36.280 --> 36:40.720
Now check around you. Modell's chart
should be somewhere around there.

36:50.840 --> 36:53.880
We're batting a thousand, Scully.
Modell's dying.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.920

37:14.240 --> 37:16.200
We think they're
three doors down.

37:16.280 --> 37:18.200
We've got both ends
sewn up tight,

37:18.280 --> 37:20.360
but there're six critical care rooms
we can't get to.

37:20.480 --> 37:23.400
If we gas the halls,
we might kill those patients.

Why do we keep giving this guy
exactly what he wants ?

Thanks for joining us.

officers outside in the hall,

of Japanese budo--

39:19.600 --> 39:23.080
the way of war.

39:23.160 --> 39:28.880
Budo teaches the warrior
to leave himself outside the battle.

39:28.960 --> 39:32.040
In other words,

39:32.120 --> 39:34.560
to disregard his own death.

39:38.480 --> 39:42.000
Because of that,
the budo warrior always wins.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.880
I am that warrior.

I don't fear my death.

against me.

if you pull that trigger.

walk outside of this room.

have to do this.

the rules. Pull the trigger, Mulder.

regain consciousness.

You know how we thought he was
undergoing treatment ? We were wrong.

43:00.320 --> 43:03.160
- What do you mean ?
- Read his chart.

43:03.240 --> 43:05.200
The M.R.I.s were a way to gauge
how much life he had left,

43:05.280 --> 43:08.200
but he consistently
refused treatment.

43:08.280 --> 43:12.320
The tumor remained operable
right up until the end,
but he refused to have it removed.

43:12.400 --> 43:15.880
- Why ?
- I think it's like you said,

43:16.960 --> 43:21.400
he was always such
a little man.

that made him feel big.
