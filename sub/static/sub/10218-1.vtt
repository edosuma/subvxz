03:03.745 --> 03:05.163
Who are you?

04:39.757 --> 04:40.883
Jesus.

04:50.810 --> 04:52.270
You ok?

04:55.064 --> 04:56.441
Do I look ok?

04:57.150 --> 04:59.902
If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist

05:03.865 --> 05:05.783
No...

05:17.211 --> 05:18.171
Trevor...

05:20.214 --> 05:22.008
You still got half an hour.

05:23.051 --> 05:24.886
I can fix you some eggs.

05:26.387 --> 05:29.640
I am tired but thanks.

06:18.189 --> 06:21.317
Let's go, monkeys.
Watch your work, not your ass.

06:25.988 --> 06:27.907
Come on guys, keep it moving.

06:28.032 --> 06:31.327
Yes sir, yes sir,
Master Tucker, motherfucker

06:33.412 --> 06:36.541
Hey, why is that machine down!

06:37.583 --> 06:40.503
- I am cleaning this.
- It takes 7 minutes to power up that mill

06:40.711 --> 06:42.797
Where am I going to make up
that 7 minutes? Miller?

06:42.964 --> 06:44.382
Your paycheck?

06:44.674 --> 06:49.804
- Back off Tucker, you don't sketch regulations.
- What regulations?

06:50.304 --> 06:55.518
Lock out devices must be in place during cleaning
and maintenance of all heavy machineries,

06:57.645 --> 07:02.608
Ya! Write to your congressman and hurry that up.

07:07.947 --> 07:13.286
Congratulations, Reznik.
You just made my shitlist.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.337
And he's like, you know, babe this babe that...
Chatting like mother fucking Barry White.

07:23.379 --> 07:26.757
Talking about what he is going to do to her,
and how to make her Cucci feel and all that.

07:26.841 --> 07:28.217
That is right.

07:28.301 --> 07:29.427
So then, she stopped

07:29.552 --> 07:33.472
She looked back at him with these
big puppy eyes she's like...

07:33.597 --> 07:38.019
That sounds good puppy,
but me no have no Cucci

07:38.060 --> 07:43.274
So, my man said, what?!
He looked down and realised that SHE IS A HE!

07:44.317 --> 07:45.776
Man, that's bullshit!

07:46.068 --> 07:50.531
You meant to tell me that this whore was wearing nothing
but a thong and this fool can't tell no difference.

07:50.614 --> 07:54.035
Hey, man. he had one of those "tuck jobs".
Come on Jones, you know how to do that.

07:54.327 --> 07:56.162
You might, I don't!

07:56.203 --> 07:57.455
Yeah, whatever.

07:57.538 --> 07:59.957
You Reznik, you wanna go for some cards tonight?

07:59.999 --> 08:01.167
Can't, got plans.

08:01.250 --> 08:06.422
Shit! See, this nigger say the same thing every poker night.
Hey, what is up with you? you used to be alright.

08:07.173 --> 08:10.051
Well, he used to hang but he ain't never been alright.

08:10.342 --> 08:13.596
Hey, Jackson, you need to realise that
some men prefer the company of women.

08:13.679 --> 08:17.975
Who! hotty duty, he ain't get no booty.

08:18.142 --> 08:21.020
Maybe he has got a date by the name "tuck jobs"

08:21.145 --> 08:25.816
No, your mother said she couldn't make it.

08:26.942 --> 08:30.613
Oh! Reznik talking smack,
I can't even respond to that.

08:51.675 --> 08:52.510
You ok?

08:54.804 --> 08:56.472
Do I look ok?

08:57.765 --> 09:00.184
If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist.

09:02.937 --> 09:03.646
What's wrong?

09:05.523 --> 09:07.566
I don't know, deja vu.

09:09.610 --> 09:11.320
You are tired, you need to sleep.

09:23.874 --> 09:25.835
How do you do it?

09:26.085 --> 09:26.627
What?

09:26.919 --> 09:29.505
Sleep so little and still look so good.

09:30.464 --> 09:31.507
Are you flirting with me?

09:32.550 --> 09:33.467
Commiserating

09:36.720 --> 09:39.098
- Try to fatten me up?
- What if I am?

09:39.974 --> 09:42.059
Suppose I wanted blueberry.

09:42.685 --> 09:44.228
You had that last night.

09:44.436 --> 09:47.731
You don't fool me, Trevor Reznik.
I have you figured out.

09:48.399 --> 09:50.359
- You do, huh?
- Muhmmm

09:52.069 --> 09:53.988
What else do you know about me?

09:55.864 --> 09:57.074
That you are lonely.

09:59.368 --> 10:03.664
When you work here as long as I have,
you get to know the type.

10:04.748 --> 10:10.212
Hey, everyone gets lonely, Trevor.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.

10:11.005 --> 10:15.718
How can I be lonely,
when I have you to keep me company?

10:15.801 --> 10:16.468
Check please

12:35.858 --> 12:40.445
You, Reznik, Furman's office. Now!

12:45.450 --> 12:46.910
How are you doing, Reznik?

12:47.953 --> 12:48.996
What is this about?

12:50.038 --> 12:51.498
Frankly I am concerned about you.

12:53.166 --> 12:56.086
To be honest, I think you look like toasted shit.

13:00.591 --> 13:02.718
I felt a lot on my mind lately.

13:02.843 --> 13:06.305
- Anything we can help with?
- No, thanks. There's nothing I can't handle.

13:06.471 --> 13:09.558
- Wanna see a doctor?
- It is not necessary, I am fine really.

13:09.683 --> 13:11.476
Are you doing drugs Reznik?

13:15.814 --> 13:17.649
Where is Stewart?

13:17.684 --> 13:19.484
He couldn't make it

13:19.651 --> 13:22.154
- Shouldn't even be in here with an union
- See what I mean.

13:22.279 --> 13:27.367
Look, Trevor, I understand how you feel, but believe me,
there is absolutely nothing to worry about

13:27.909 --> 13:29.161
Then I will just get back to work

13:29.196 --> 13:31.622
Er... Trevor, not yet.

13:34.082 --> 13:35.917
I need to ask you for a UA

14:51.701 --> 14:52.828
Look like rain.

15:03.839 --> 15:05.882
Radio says there is a storm on the way.

15:10.387 --> 15:13.063
they said right.

15:13.098 --> 15:14.891
I'd say it's already here.

15:19.771 --> 15:21.231
You are on the first shift?

15:23.316 --> 15:25.193
- Yeah
- Me too

15:28.530 --> 15:30.240
Funny I never seen you before.

15:31.449 --> 15:33.500
I've been here.

15:33.535 --> 15:37.539
I work in the pit
I just picked up Reynolds's shift.

15:38.039 --> 15:39.749
Where is Reynolds?

15:41.167 --> 15:44.588
Feds picked him up.
On warrant.

15:52.804 --> 15:53.513
I am Ivan.

16:00.020 --> 16:00.604
Trevor

16:04.941 --> 16:09.703
Well, I guess I'd better begin by...

16:09.738 --> 16:12.657
I hear that Tucker guy can be a real prick.

16:13.158 --> 16:14.492
You got that right.

16:16.077 --> 16:17.412
I will see you around.

16:46.441 --> 16:47.233
what is wrong?

16:48.610 --> 16:50.403
I just want to lie here.

16:51.446 --> 16:52.697
We can do that.

16:55.408 --> 16:57.994
I'm... so... tired

16:58.828 --> 17:02.499
You can fall asleep if you want, off the meter.

17:02.666 --> 17:06.086
That is the problem. I can't sleep.

17:07.087 --> 17:08.421
Nothing helps.

17:10.298 --> 17:12.925
Don't worry about it honey.

17:13.050 --> 17:15.595
Everyone get insomnia every now and then.

17:17.680 --> 17:18.848
Stevie

17:22.185 --> 17:25.313
I haven't slept in a year.

17:33.363 --> 17:35.824
Jesus Christ!

17:36.866 --> 17:38.368
I tried him too...

17:44.499 --> 17:45.542
I am sorry.

17:49.838 --> 17:50.880
Hello?

17:52.757 --> 17:58.096
Yeah. No I can't.
I can't talk now. Okay.

18:02.642 --> 18:06.813
My ex, he's a fucking Psycho.

18:10.066 --> 18:12.152
Trevor, I am worried about you.

18:12.652 --> 18:17.448
Don't worry, no one ever died of insomnia.

18:18.366 --> 18:23.580
I hope not, you are my best client.
Can't afford to lose ya.

18:23.615 --> 18:26.708
Geee... thanks

18:29.335 --> 18:32.088
Reznik, I need a hand

18:41.431 --> 18:43.933
Gotta get this dead level here, help me out

18:46.019 --> 18:48.104
- Safety on?
- Oh Yeah

18:54.360 --> 18:55.528
How is that?

18:55.945 --> 18:56.863
A little to the left.

19:08.791 --> 19:09.709
Do I need more?

19:10.627 --> 19:14.547
Hey, you sleep on your own time, need some help here.

19:15.882 --> 19:17.717
Better, now try the other side.

19:19.802 --> 19:20.762
I hate this bitch.

19:45.119 --> 19:46.496
Hey! what did you do?

19:48.373 --> 19:50.333
I am hooked up here.
Kill it, will ya?

19:52.877 --> 19:55.046
- Come on, kill it.
- Not working.

19:55.463 --> 19:56.964
Damn it! Reznik!
Shit!

19:57.882 --> 19:58.800
- Kill it!
- Not working

20:02.970 --> 20:03.805
God! Jesus!

20:04.639 --> 20:06.349
- Hit the breaker!
- What?

20:07.350 --> 20:08.142
Hit the breaker!

20:13.106 --> 20:18.861
Hey, hey, hey!
We some help over here!

20:19.737 --> 20:20.905
We need some help

20:24.867 --> 20:26.953
- Come on man, come on.
- What's happening here, man?

20:28.538 --> 20:30.081
Call an ambulance!

20:31.541 --> 20:32.709
What happened here?

20:32.834 --> 20:35.086
I was helping him with the belt.
I thought the safety was on.

20:35.336 --> 20:36.129
You thought?!

20:38.631 --> 20:40.425
Somebody kill that fucking machine!

21:50.161 --> 21:51.204
Shit!

22:21.233 --> 22:23.986
Hello, Mrs. Shrike. I come to give you the rent.

22:24.153 --> 22:29.784
And so early. Oh Mr Reznik, I only wish
all my tenants are considerate as you.

22:30.034 --> 22:31.577
I will give you a receipt in the morning

22:32.995 --> 22:34.163
Good night mr. Reznik.

22:34.372 --> 22:37.249
Err... Mrs. Shrike, Forgive me

22:37.375 --> 22:41.337
but... if you noticed anyone
hanging around my apartment?

22:42.380 --> 22:46.258
- Has there been a burglary?
- No, no, no, I just wondered if...

22:46.467 --> 22:51.681
You know errr... if you noticed anything unusual lately?

22:52.223 --> 22:53.432
Unusual?

22:55.518 --> 22:57.937
Ah, never mind, Mrs. Shrike.

22:58.145 --> 23:02.692
I am sorry... to disturb you so late.
Good night.

23:08.489 --> 23:11.283
What we know is this:

23:11.784 --> 23:16.997
One: Miller was operating the mill in long sleeves.

23:17.665 --> 23:22.837
Two: Miller's arm was in the cutting zone
of mill while it was off.

23:23.045 --> 23:26.048
Three: the mill suddenly activates,

23:26.173 --> 23:30.344
catching Miller's sleeve, resulting in this.

23:40.813 --> 23:42.440
What is the fucking point?

23:42.982 --> 23:45.609
These accidents are never pretty, Mr. Reznik.

23:45.818 --> 23:49.196
Our job is to investigate these events
from every possible angles...

23:49.321 --> 23:52.825
So that we might prevent their reoccurrence.

23:52.908 --> 23:57.079
So we'd appreciate it if you are a bit more co-operative.

23:58.330 --> 24:01.542
I knocked into the fucking activator by mistake.

24:02.001 --> 24:03.919
What caused the mistake, Mr. Reznik?

24:04.962 --> 24:06.380
I was distracted.

24:06.547 --> 24:09.884
By what?
What distracted you?

24:18.642 --> 24:20.519
It was Ivan,
I was watching Ivan on the pit.

24:20.728 --> 24:23.272
The whole thing is my fault, okay.

24:24.356 --> 24:25.774
Who did you say?

24:25.941 --> 24:28.903
The new arcwelder,
I don't know his last name.

24:29.069 --> 24:32.406
- What new arcwelder?
- Ivan, the guy from the swing shift.

24:32.490 --> 24:35.910
Reynolds was picked up on a warrant
This guy got his place.

24:36.076 --> 24:38.078
What the fuck are you talking about, Reznik?

24:38.245 --> 24:41.624
Reynolds is right over there
on the pit as usual, busting his ass.

24:42.208 --> 24:46.587
There is no Ivan in National Machine, Reznik.

25:05.773 --> 25:07.024
What is this?

25:07.942 --> 25:11.320
Mr. Reznik
Have you recently suffered any head injuries?

26:19.388 --> 26:21.640
Ever hear of pumpkin pie?

26:21.807 --> 26:23.058
No

26:24.101 --> 26:25.894
- Trevor
- Yeah

26:26.061 --> 26:28.313
Can I ask you a question?
Sure

26:29.356 --> 26:32.401
Why do you go all of your way
to come here every night?

26:32.436 --> 26:34.486
Is it all the way?

26:34.737 --> 26:38.073
An airport? For coffee and pie?

26:38.574 --> 26:40.874
Suppose I went to Danni's...

26:40.909 --> 26:44.455
Suddenly I get an overwhelming urge to skip town.

26:44.705 --> 26:47.207
Could I do that just in any diner?

26:48.167 --> 26:50.586
Is someone chasing you?

26:51.086 --> 26:55.132
Not yet. But they will
when they find out who I am.

26:55.466 --> 26:58.469
Oh really! Who are you?

26:59.094 --> 27:00.846
Can you keep a secret?

27:01.722 --> 27:03.766
To the grave.

27:04.433 --> 27:05.684
I am Elvis Presley.

27:06.643 --> 27:10.189
I ran away from home
to pursue my blue-collar aspirations.

27:10.397 --> 27:12.816
I thought you looked familiar.

27:21.325 --> 27:23.660
Got plans for mother's day?

27:24.161 --> 27:26.747
I am taking my little boy to the amusement park.

27:26.955 --> 27:30.250
Suppose to be my day and he gets all the fun.

27:30.501 --> 27:32.544
That is ok, when he is older

27:32.579 --> 27:34.588
I will let him make it up to me.

27:35.005 --> 27:37.216
A little guilt goes a long way.

27:37.591 --> 27:38.675
How about you?

27:39.176 --> 27:40.427
Cemetery

27:41.261 --> 27:44.681
- Oh, I am sorry
- Thanks

27:45.724 --> 27:49.102
I lost mine too. Still hurts.

27:50.145 --> 27:52.940
I am not so good at losing family.

27:53.357 --> 27:53.941
Who is?

27:56.777 --> 28:00.822
What's weird is that it did not hit
until I picked out her burial dress.

28:01.865 --> 28:04.451
I pictured her while buying it...

28:04.576 --> 28:08.413
...Not knowing it would...

28:08.539 --> 28:10.415
You know, be the one.

28:13.043 --> 28:14.920
Seems unfair, isn't it?

28:16.255 --> 28:17.965
Not knowing things like that

28:21.093 --> 28:26.306
Hey, how about spending the day
with me and Nicolas after the cemetery?

28:34.606 --> 28:36.400
Sounds dreamy

29:08.932 --> 29:11.309
Hey Reynolds, what did the Feds want you for?

29:12.352 --> 29:13.645
Armed robbery.

29:14.062 --> 29:17.524
Oh yeah, that is right, because I and Jackson
had you packed and pantified... ain't that right, Jackson?

29:19.776 --> 29:21.778
HEY, I don't see what is so fucking funny.

29:22.821 --> 29:27.075
You clowns think this's fucking like some big joke
but it ain't!

29:28.827 --> 29:33.040
Personally, I don't feel too comfortable working with you.

29:33.999 --> 29:35.333
You made me nervous.

29:36.376 --> 29:40.547
You look like shit, acting all crazy.
What is up with you?

29:41.256 --> 29:42.299
Nothing is up with me.

29:42.924 --> 29:46.053
It was an accident and I am the one
who gotta live with it, not you.

29:49.181 --> 29:51.683
You ain't hearing me, man.

29:52.350 --> 29:56.646
Nobody wants you here.
Nobody.

30:17.626 --> 30:18.668
See you tomorrow.

30:35.185 --> 30:35.852
Hey

31:09.886 --> 31:11.096
Howdy, partner.

31:11.137 --> 31:14.266
You gotta go back to the shop.
Tucker needs to see you.

31:14.432 --> 31:17.394
- What about?
- I don't know, but it seemed important.

31:17.519 --> 31:21.773
What! He's ganna have to wait,
it is Miller time.

31:25.527 --> 31:26.653
We need to talk.

31:29.781 --> 31:30.448
Follow me.

31:41.501 --> 31:42.377
Come on!

31:55.432 --> 31:56.266
Another Bourbon.

32:01.646 --> 32:02.939
Make it double.

32:13.575 --> 32:15.118
You shooting coke or something?

32:17.037 --> 32:20.749
You look like a dope fiend to me.
No offence.

32:20.874 --> 32:24.377
I don't use drugs.
I mean I don't even drink.

32:24.461 --> 32:26.004
How about abnormally?

32:29.257 --> 32:31.634
I see Reynolds is back to work.

32:33.928 --> 32:35.388
Gets to me bail

32:36.097 --> 32:39.768
I will tell you one thing,
If I dig, You are showing carbon to it.

32:39.851 --> 32:44.397
Would you? never trust a con, cowboy!

32:44.564 --> 32:46.232
They ain't get to live to be honest.

32:48.318 --> 32:50.195
Where they hiding you these days?

32:52.072 --> 32:53.031
Around

32:58.661 --> 33:00.246
Hey, you wanna see something?

33:04.459 --> 33:08.671
Look at that. Lost them on a lake.

33:09.839 --> 33:14.094
They took a big toe from the left foot
and a finger from my right.

33:14.219 --> 33:16.679
That is why I walk with a gimp.

33:17.722 --> 33:22.936
Yeah, I can't shuffle my cock like I used to
but the ladies sure like it.

33:27.232 --> 33:30.026
Oh, no. You look like you have seen a ghost.

33:30.860 --> 33:36.074
Funny you should say that.
The guys from work don't think you exist.

33:37.200 --> 33:41.496
- That is why I can't get a raise.
- According to Tucker, you are not even on the payroll.

33:42.121 --> 33:43.248
You believe that?

33:44.290 --> 33:47.752
- Why would they lie?
- They just have a little bit of fun with you.

33:48.586 --> 33:50.213
I am not laughing.

33:54.300 --> 33:58.179
Quit fucking around, a guy lost his arm.
He could have died.

34:00.348 --> 34:01.891
That ain't my problem.

34:03.393 --> 34:08.606
You caused the accident, not me.

34:14.237 --> 34:15.737
Where are you going?

34:17.657 --> 34:21.828
Take a leak, you wanna watch?

34:23.705 --> 34:26.833
I will be right back, don't just bail me now.

35:06.581 --> 35:11.794
- Hello?
- Hey Reynolds, it's Trevor.

35:12.837 --> 35:14.756
What time is it?

35:16.174 --> 35:18.176
How are they biting Reynolds?

35:20.261 --> 35:27.769
- You, you are drunk, Reznik.
- The game's over. I got proof on you.

35:28.478 --> 35:30.730
I could use it.

35:31.439 --> 35:35.735
You better watch your fucking ass buddy,
before you lose it.

36:36.587 --> 36:37.588
Trevor?

36:38.214 --> 36:40.049
I need to see you, Stevie.

36:42.301 --> 36:46.889
- Well, Jesus, Trevor, I am not exactly alone here.
- Please, Stevie.

36:47.014 --> 36:50.810
- I think I am falling apart.
- Can you come back in an hour?

36:51.102 --> 36:53.980
No, no, no, no, I need to see you now.

36:54.021 --> 36:58.067
In case of something happens,
I need someone to know.

37:02.238 --> 37:03.364
Ok, give me a minute.

37:06.784 --> 37:09.912
I appreciate you making time for me,
you are the only one I can talk to.

37:12.748 --> 37:13.958
My pleasure.

37:15.585 --> 37:18.796
Most guys don't come here for my conversation.

37:22.675 --> 37:25.928
Something is happening to me, Stevie.

37:26.846 --> 37:30.349
Some kind of... plot.

37:32.143 --> 37:37.440
There was an accident at the shop.
A man was nearly killed thanks to me.

37:37.857 --> 37:40.776
- Oh, my god!
- Now the guys at work are against me.

37:40.901 --> 37:46.115
They want me out and I don't blame them.
Just the way they're going about it...

37:46.240 --> 37:50.411
Their eyes, their little games.

37:54.457 --> 37:55.583
What?

37:57.293 --> 38:00.671
E R.. E R..

38:00.796 --> 38:05.426
- T U C K E R
- Trevor?

38:05.676 --> 38:07.386
TUCKER?

38:08.429 --> 38:13.100
Maybe err you take this accident thing a bit too hard.

38:13.851 --> 38:14.143
I mean...

38:17.271 --> 38:21.484
If they wanted you out,
they could just fire you.

38:22.276 --> 38:24.153
I am not worried about being fired.

38:25.112 --> 38:26.989
Then what are you worried about?

38:30.201 --> 38:31.410
I don't know yet.

38:43.756 --> 38:45.925
There you go, made to order.

38:46.092 --> 38:48.677
- Thanks.
- Surprise!

38:50.763 --> 38:53.724
Got ya! That one's going on the fridge.

38:53.849 --> 38:56.310
Here, let me get one of you and Nicolas.

38:58.604 --> 38:59.688
By the carousel.

39:01.607 --> 39:02.650
Just a minute.

39:07.113 --> 39:08.406
Okay, ready.

39:09.865 --> 39:10.825
Smile!

39:19.333 --> 39:21.168
It helps if you push the button.

39:27.049 --> 39:28.717
Trevor? What is it?

39:36.350 --> 39:41.021
- This place, brings back memories.
- Good memories I hope.

39:41.188 --> 39:44.400
Yeah, I haven't been here since I was a kid.

39:48.028 --> 39:52.199
My ex, probably phone
to ruin a happy Mother's Day

39:53.450 --> 39:55.786
Could you...?

39:55.995 --> 40:00.082
- Yes, no sweat. I will take Nicolas for a ride.
- Thanks.

40:06.797 --> 40:08.674
How long have you known my mother?

40:09.717 --> 40:10.801
About a year.

40:13.137 --> 40:14.763
How did you meet her?

40:15.764 --> 40:16.849
We just kind of met.

40:18.767 --> 40:20.895
Are you going to see her again?

40:21.061 --> 40:22.271
I hope so.

40:23.564 --> 40:25.149
Would you like that?

40:25.316 --> 40:26.317
I guess so

40:29.945 --> 40:32.156
Hey, you wanna know a secret?

40:32.740 --> 40:33.616
What?

40:34.325 --> 40:38.579
My father left us when I was your age.
You wanna know something else?

40:38.704 --> 40:41.582
Made me realised what a wonderful mother I had.

40:42.750 --> 40:45.377
You will realise that too some day.

40:45.669 --> 40:46.712
What is that?

40:47.755 --> 40:48.923
Monster ride.

40:49.214 --> 40:52.927
Route six hundred and sixty six.
What does that mean?

40:53.802 --> 40:57.973
Well, a route is a road you take
when you're on a long journey.

40:58.307 --> 40:59.433
Can we go in?

41:00.893 --> 41:03.437
Well, Nicolas, maybe we should wait for your mother.

41:03.562 --> 41:04.647
What for?

41:04.855 --> 41:08.817
You are going straight
to hell on route 666.

41:09.610 --> 41:16.867
Ride here if you dare!
You are going straight to hell on route 666.

41:20.371 --> 41:22.581
Look like someone had a bad crack up.

41:24.708 --> 41:26.418
Fill her up, cowboy.

41:34.760 --> 41:37.262
We wouldn't be eating in there
anytime soon, Nicolas?

41:53.112 --> 41:54.613
Eww.. look at that.

41:59.410 --> 42:00.953
You should close your eyes.

42:13.173 --> 42:14.007
Jesus!

42:20.347 --> 42:23.559
- Boy, this is one heck of a ride.
- Yeah.

42:28.188 --> 42:29.565
Shady Lady

42:33.569 --> 42:34.778
Oh, my God.

42:36.405 --> 42:37.364
Stop!

42:37.739 --> 42:38.490
Woo

42:54.756 --> 42:58.177
Take a right, Nicolas!
Right, a right!

43:27.414 --> 43:32.586
Nicolas, Nicolas!
Hey, Nicolas!

43:47.517 --> 43:49.019
I need some help here.

43:50.938 --> 43:52.981
Okay, somebody gets a doctor.

43:53.690 --> 43:55.484
Hang on Nicolas, I'm going for help.

43:55.651 --> 43:56.568
Nicolas!

44:04.743 --> 44:07.120
I swear to God, I don't know what happened.

44:07.663 --> 44:09.498
He is epileptic.
I should have told you.

44:11.583 --> 44:13.919
- I will call an ambulance.
- No, thanks.

44:15.545 --> 44:16.713
It is ok, baby.

44:30.477 --> 44:34.231
It hasn't happened for a while.
I didn't think to mention it.

44:34.731 --> 44:37.192
I could have killed myself
for taking him on that ride.

44:37.359 --> 44:39.027
It's ok, it's not your fault.

44:41.113 --> 44:44.241
He won't even remember it,
as if nothing ever happened.

44:53.542 --> 44:54.668
Wanna come in?

44:55.711 --> 44:57.254
I think you could use a drink.

45:43.383 --> 45:45.010
I hope wine is okay with you.

45:47.846 --> 45:48.805
That'll work.

45:52.976 --> 45:56.646
What good is it at home
if you can't relax in it.

45:57.689 --> 45:59.232
I will have to remember that.

46:10.827 --> 46:13.163
Trevor? Can I ask you something?

46:15.373 --> 46:17.500
Should my lawyer be present?

46:20.795 --> 46:24.007
Why are you always leaving such generous tips?

46:24.341 --> 46:27.552
- Do I?
- 20 dollars for coffee and pie?

46:27.636 --> 46:29.471
And entertainment.

46:30.889 --> 46:32.724
- Entertainment?
- You.

46:34.976 --> 46:38.396
Trevor, you don't have to buy my companionship.

46:39.773 --> 46:42.943
Sorry, I wasn't meant that way.

46:45.403 --> 46:49.240
If you really wanna spoil me,
take me to a movie sometime.

46:49.908 --> 46:50.659
Hmmm?

46:52.619 --> 46:53.536
That is a deal.

46:59.834 --> 47:02.379
My goodness, there must be a hole in this glass.

47:04.464 --> 47:05.715
I will get it.

47:06.925 --> 47:09.135
- You wait on me.
- Thanks

47:14.599 --> 47:16.184
It is the last door on the left.

50:52.025 --> 50:52.859
Reznik

50:55.361 --> 50:58.072
I want you on the Swansea-leave today.

50:59.115 --> 51:03.786
- Where is Sanchez?
- That is an irrelevant question, Reznik, I'm asking you.

51:19.302 --> 51:20.261
Shit!

51:36.402 --> 51:40.364
- If there's anything else we can do for you, let us know.
- Thank you, Mr Furman.

51:40.907 --> 51:43.701
Bye. See you now.

51:44.243 --> 51:47.497
Hey, look who it is.
Bombay Miller, you ok?

51:47.580 --> 51:50.458
- Good, good.
- You be easy now.

51:50.541 --> 51:51.709
Yeah, man, take it easy.

51:53.628 --> 51:57.173
My God, Miller.
I don't know where to begin.

51:58.424 --> 52:01.260
Nah, don't sweat it, kid.
There is nothing to say.

52:01.677 --> 52:04.180
I wish there is someway I can repay you.

52:07.808 --> 52:10.645
Well, for a start, you can give me your left arm.

52:11.020 --> 52:13.689
In fact, that is why I came
by here today. Isn't it, Tucker?

52:13.773 --> 52:14.982
Fair is fair

52:16.901 --> 52:19.278
We are just razzing you, kid

52:20.312 --> 52:22.648
You keep your left arm,
I will keep my settlement.

52:23.023 --> 52:26.902
Hell! How can a guy lost an arm
end up like getting a deal like this?

52:26.937 --> 52:28.529
So, I guess you can call me lucky.

52:28.738 --> 52:32.450
Well, Miller,
if there is anything I can do...

52:34.410 --> 52:38.372
Nah, forget it.
No hard feelings, huh.

52:40.249 --> 52:41.542
I will see you around, pal.

53:18.204 --> 53:18.746
Ah!

53:19.622 --> 53:20.581
Hey!

53:21.624 --> 53:22.791
Help!

53:29.048 --> 53:29.882
Hey!

53:30.591 --> 53:31.300
Hey!

53:33.552 --> 53:36.347
Someone help me!
Someone help me!

53:51.028 --> 53:51.904
Reznik

53:52.071 --> 53:52.953
Ah...

53:52.988 --> 53:53.989
I got ya, I got ya.

53:54.156 --> 53:56.033
Be cool, be cool, alright?

53:59.912 --> 54:03.415
Who did it, huh?

54:03.666 --> 54:05.501
Why did you turn the fucking braker!

54:05.876 --> 54:07.628
Was it all of you?

54:08.671 --> 54:09.922
Was it you, Jones?

54:10.256 --> 54:11.840
Was it you? Was it you?

54:12.007 --> 54:13.133
Or was it you?

54:13.384 --> 54:15.177
You sick bastard,
you're imagining things again!

54:15.344 --> 54:18.389
Oh yeah? You've been fishing
with Ivan lately, Reynolds?

54:19.098 --> 54:23.644
How's that... How's that tuna biting?
Let's see how you talk yourself out of this one!

54:32.027 --> 54:33.570
Where is it?

54:33.988 --> 54:35.823
Right, what the fuck now, Reznik!

54:39.076 --> 54:40.577
Get him off me!

54:43.580 --> 54:45.374
Pick up your shit and get the fuck out of here.

54:45.666 --> 54:46.750
You are fired.

54:56.176 --> 54:57.302
This motherfucker's crazy.

54:57.886 --> 54:59.221
You lost it, man.

55:20.409 --> 55:21.285
Shit!

55:30.210 --> 55:31.545
Damn it! Where is it?

55:40.929 --> 55:41.805
Asshole!

55:43.348 --> 55:45.225
What the fuck did you do with it?

55:47.978 --> 55:48.854
Idiot!

57:18.735 --> 57:19.319
Hey! Fuck you!

57:20.862 --> 57:21.822
Get out!

57:38.547 --> 57:39.506
What?

57:42.634 --> 57:44.219
It's an occupational hazard.

58:01.403 --> 58:08.243
So, Trevor, are you gonna rescue me from
this miserable life or what?

58:15.959 --> 58:17.669
I could give it up for the right guy.

58:24.092 --> 58:26.053
Oh, that came out wrong.

58:29.347 --> 58:30.682
What I mean is...

58:31.933 --> 58:38.607
I would, you know,
stop hooking if you wanted me to.

58:41.318 --> 58:43.445
I mean, there are lots of
pancakes out there, right?

58:51.119 --> 58:52.579
I think I'd like that.

01:00:16.246 --> 01:00:17.414
Mr. Reznik.

01:00:17.581 --> 01:00:20.083
I am sorry, I thought it was somebody else.

01:00:20.125 --> 01:00:21.751
You leave me in such a scare.

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:27.632
What are you doing in my apartment?

01:00:27.841 --> 01:00:30.260
There is a leak in my ceiling.
It's coming from your apartment.

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:31.970
That's impossible.

01:00:32.304 --> 01:00:34.306
I'm gonna leave a note.

01:00:34.341 --> 01:00:36.308
A note? What kind of note?

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.268
About the leak.

01:00:39.978 --> 01:00:41.521
What's that terrible smell?

01:00:42.022 --> 01:00:43.565
There is no leak in this apartment.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.824
Now if you would excuse me...

01:00:45.859 --> 01:00:46.491
You're sure you're alright, Mr. Reznik?

01:00:46.526 --> 01:00:50.488
Yeah, I'm sure. If you need anything,
please call first.

01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:17.992
Miller!

01:02:19.494 --> 01:02:20.620
Hey, Reznik.

01:02:21.579 --> 01:02:23.206
It's a pleasant surprise.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.291
We need to talk.

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:27.502
Take a look at this, huh?

01:02:27.794 --> 01:02:29.587
Picked it up at Grossens, top of the line.

01:02:30.755 --> 01:02:33.299
Let's not trim anyting for a while.

01:02:33.334 --> 01:02:34.307
I need to be doing something.

01:02:34.342 --> 01:02:36.392
Can't just watch the soap opera all day.

01:02:36.427 --> 01:02:41.140
That hydro will be here tomorrow.
You won't. Listen to the doctor.

01:02:41.175 --> 01:02:45.228
Margie, this is Reznik.
The man who cost me my arm.

01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:50.692
How do you do, Mrs. Miller?

01:02:52.026 --> 01:02:53.903
I've been better, Mr. Reznik.

01:02:58.866 --> 01:03:00.743
Is there some place we can talk?

01:03:03.037 --> 01:03:08.293
Check it out.
It's a beauty.

01:03:10.003 --> 01:03:11.421
8 cylinders

01:03:13.798 --> 01:03:15.640
Speed sensitive steering

01:03:15.675 --> 01:03:19.269
ABS breaking with road texure and tension

01:03:19.304 --> 01:03:24.392
Defence lock-up helps you
maintain control in emergencies.

01:03:24.427 --> 01:03:25.977
Of course, it's automatic.

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:27.193
Hell I wanted a stick...

01:03:27.228 --> 01:03:30.648
but I figured my shifting ability
wouldn't be so hot.

01:03:33.568 --> 01:03:35.361
You know I am not at
National any more, right?

01:03:35.612 --> 01:03:36.863
Yeah, I heard about it.

01:03:37.155 --> 01:03:39.073
It sounds like you almost
lost one yourself, huh?

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:42.452
Did you find that a bit ironic, Miller?

01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:43.953
Ironic?

01:03:44.996 --> 01:03:47.123
I'm sorry kid, I never got over sixth grade.

01:03:47.915 --> 01:03:49.751
I'll break it down for you, Miller.

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:52.670
Moments after you left the shop,

01:03:52.705 --> 01:03:54.547
someone powered up my machine.

01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:56.507
With my arm in it.

01:03:57.175 --> 01:03:58.384
I nearly got killed.

01:03:58.718 --> 01:03:59.726
Accidents happen.

01:03:59.761 --> 01:04:00.803
It wasn't an accident.

01:04:02.889 --> 01:04:04.682
Accidents happen out of negligence

01:04:05.725 --> 01:04:07.650
This happened down the spike.

01:04:07.685 --> 01:04:09.354
That's some vocabulary you got kid.

01:04:09.389 --> 01:04:10.271
Spike.

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:13.670
It wields vengeance,
vengeance means revenge Miller.

01:04:13.705 --> 01:04:16.027
I am sure you know
what revenge means, don't you?

01:04:16.062 --> 01:04:17.327
I am onto you Miller.

01:04:17.362 --> 01:04:20.740
Despite your stupid jokes,
you secretly balme me for the accident.

01:04:20.775 --> 01:04:23.409
New car, huh? You despise me for it.

01:04:23.444 --> 01:04:24.949
How did you get into my place?

01:04:24.984 --> 01:04:26.454
Duplicate keys? credit card? What?

01:04:26.489 --> 01:04:28.379
Fuck you, Miller!

01:04:28.414 --> 01:04:29.665
This shit is gonna stop!

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:40.843
Get off my property, punk!

01:05:02.949 --> 01:05:03.991
Bastards.

01:05:08.246 --> 01:05:19.674
Shit.

01:05:34.981 --> 01:05:35.815
Come on.

01:06:15.396 --> 01:06:16.960
7-4...

01:06:16.995 --> 01:06:18.552
...3-C-R

01:06:18.587 --> 01:06:20.109
It's 743CR.

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:30.036
What?

01:06:33.873 --> 01:06:34.665
Shit.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.760
Fuck!

01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:50.730
I'm sorry sir, but we don't provide...

01:06:50.765 --> 01:06:52.808
...motor's information to the general public.

01:06:52.843 --> 01:06:54.852
I'm not just a memeber of the general public.

01:06:54.887 --> 01:06:56.604
This guy is a friend of mine.

01:06:57.313 --> 01:06:59.482
But you don't know your firend's address?

01:06:59.517 --> 01:07:01.651
We just met, I don't know him that well.

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:05.446
Sir, this is the DMV, not the dating service.

01:07:05.481 --> 01:07:07.323
I just want talk to him.

01:07:08.074 --> 01:07:11.285
I'm sorry sir, I can't help you
unless a crime has been committed.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.328
Has a crime been committed?

01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:17.917
Please, I wouldn't ask
if it weren't extremly important.

01:07:17.952 --> 01:07:19.960
Sorry sir. No crime, no information.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.762
What if I told you I was hit by this car?

01:07:31.639 --> 01:07:33.189
I don't see any bruises.

01:07:33.224 --> 01:07:35.101
If you did,
would you give me an address?

01:07:36.268 --> 01:07:37.895
No, but the police might.

01:09:22.875 --> 01:09:24.376
I want to report a hit and run.

01:09:34.678 --> 01:09:38.390
Bring it back when you are finished.
Fill it out over there.

01:10:18.889 --> 01:10:20.057
Mr. Reznik.

01:10:22.059 --> 01:10:24.228
You sure about these plate numbers?

01:10:24.937 --> 01:10:27.606
743CR. All right, that's the one.

01:10:27.641 --> 01:10:30.275
Do you ever have a car stolen?

01:10:31.235 --> 01:10:32.444
No, what?

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.572
Cause the car that
allegedly hit you was your own.

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:41.829
1969, red pontiac viper
registered to your name.

01:10:42.329 --> 01:10:44.748
Nearly a year ago you reported it
as being totally wrecked.

01:10:56.009 --> 01:10:58.387
Do you know it is a felony
to file a bogus police report?

01:11:00.597 --> 01:11:03.100
Hey, wait a minute.
You got some explaining to do.

01:11:03.135 --> 01:11:04.059
Hey! Hey!

01:12:33.815 --> 01:12:36.026
Jesus, Reznik. Just wanna talk to you.

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:42.157
Hey come back. Reznik, Reznik!

01:14:10.287 --> 01:14:10.996
Trevor?

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:14.958
Oh, no.

01:14:22.257 --> 01:14:23.842
Trevor, what do you want?

01:14:26.303 --> 01:14:28.847
Trevor, it's okay.

01:14:33.935 --> 01:14:35.395
Oh God, what happend?

01:14:36.855 --> 01:14:40.942
I was crossing the street.
Lights changed on me.

01:14:43.111 --> 01:14:44.821
Did he stop?

01:14:46.156 --> 01:14:49.367
No, he just kept going.

01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:52.579
He fucking hit my drivers man.

01:14:53.246 --> 01:14:55.123
He gotta be hanged.

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:57.883
It was my fault.

01:14:57.918 --> 01:15:00.253
I wasn't paying attention.

01:15:00.837 --> 01:15:03.006
Trevor, we got get you to a hospital.

01:15:04.507 --> 01:15:05.926
You may have some internal injuries.

01:15:05.961 --> 01:15:07.636
it is just bruises.

01:15:08.261 --> 01:15:09.512
Okay, you see this?

01:15:10.096 --> 01:15:13.475
This is a bruise,
and this is a train wreck, alright?

01:15:15.101 --> 01:15:17.562
What is it with you and doctors?
Don't you trust anyone?

01:15:20.482 --> 01:15:21.691
I trust you.

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:25.320
Now I know.
You are crazy.

01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:28.448
Can I stay here tonight?

01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:31.493
Babe, you can stay here every night.

01:15:33.036 --> 01:15:34.120
You know that?

01:15:36.581 --> 01:15:37.415
What?

01:15:38.833 --> 01:15:41.586
What,Babe,
what's going on in that crazy head of yours?

01:15:43.505 --> 01:15:45.173
I really want this to work, Stevie

01:15:49.052 --> 01:15:49.844
But?

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:54.140
You know so little about me.

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:58.311
What if I turned into a warewolf or something?

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:04.442
I will buy you a flea collar.

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:11.658
I love you.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:20.875
Stevie

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:21.751
Yeah.

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:23.294
Thanks.

01:16:38.351 --> 01:16:42.689
I set out some clean cloth for you,
your stuff is not dry yet.

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.316
You always keep men's cloth lying around?

01:16:46.359 --> 01:16:50.238
Some of my regulars.
They like to keep their clean change cloth here.

01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:53.032
I probably just throw
them out now, alright?

01:16:53.783 --> 01:16:55.452
Hey, perfect fit.

01:16:57.328 --> 01:16:58.663
Yeah, whatever Trevor.

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.541
I don't have a size 26 waist here.

01:17:02.625 --> 01:17:04.335
Hey, how about that idea.

01:17:05.378 --> 01:17:06.963
I can get a job selling man's wear.

01:17:08.256 --> 01:17:10.675
Those chicks got paid vacations too.

01:17:11.384 --> 01:17:12.969
I'll settle for that.

01:17:14.554 --> 01:17:15.972
That's not a bad life.

01:17:16.473 --> 01:17:18.314
Could be worse.
You know whatelse I want to do?

01:17:18.349 --> 01:17:23.062
I want to clean up this place,
just get rid of all the fucking junk.

01:17:24.022 --> 01:17:26.608
Probably look like I'm a terrible housekeeper,
which I sometimes am...

01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:30.278
...but I can also be very very,
you know, organised and neat.

01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:32.030
And I wanna do more of that.

01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:35.074
I would love to paint a place.

01:17:36.117 --> 01:17:40.580
Just make it nice, just be organised,
and neat and paint it white.

01:17:42.874 --> 01:17:46.920
What I would also like is a decent stove.
This one is covered in fat.

01:18:11.444 --> 01:18:16.699
Just like a white, beautiful place
and a decent stove.

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.326
Not a lot to ask.

01:18:21.329 --> 01:18:25.750
Wow, don't look so surprised.
A call girl scrambling eggs...

01:18:29.170 --> 01:18:32.423
Yeah that's funny,
I dont think I ever cooked for a guy before.

01:18:35.551 --> 01:18:36.678
Not even my husband.

01:18:40.348 --> 01:18:41.766
Jesus Christ.

01:18:43.184 --> 01:18:44.102
Where is he?

01:18:46.312 --> 01:18:46.980
Who?

01:18:47.313 --> 01:18:48.189
You know who.

01:18:51.067 --> 01:18:52.944
- Trevor.
- Don't.

01:18:55.238 --> 01:18:57.448
Jesus, Trevor, what's wrong?

01:18:58.032 --> 01:19:00.576
This, Ivan.

01:19:01.619 --> 01:19:03.371
He's your ex, isn't he?

01:19:03.406 --> 01:19:04.420
What?

01:19:04.455 --> 01:19:05.873
Why is he doing this?

01:19:06.624 --> 01:19:08.459
Just becuase i'm fucking you, isn't it?

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:10.760
Now it all makes sense.

01:19:10.795 --> 01:19:13.798
I'm fucking you, so he's fucking me.

01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:14.639
Where is he?

01:19:14.674 --> 01:19:16.808
Hiding in the closet, beneath the bed?

01:19:16.843 --> 01:19:19.012
I don't know what you are talking about, babe.

01:19:19.047 --> 01:19:21.097
Ah, don't babe me.

01:19:22.348 --> 01:19:23.850
Yeah, babe.

01:19:24.892 --> 01:19:28.813
I'll change my whole fucking life for you.
I'll do anything you want, babe.

01:19:31.107 --> 01:19:33.860
You know what, I don't deserve this.

01:19:34.152 --> 01:19:35.028
What did you do?

01:19:35.695 --> 01:19:38.823
- Hey!
- Slip this from my wallet from me while proposing to me?

01:19:38.858 --> 01:19:39.741
Fuck you!

01:19:40.199 --> 01:19:42.750
- You left it in my tip jar the other night.
- Bullshit.

01:19:42.785 --> 01:19:45.997
- I thought you wanted me to have it.
- Cut the crap, Stevie.

01:19:47.039 --> 01:19:51.669
- What is a big deal about a goddamn picture?
- They said that the guy in the photo doesn't exsit.

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:56.758
- This says he does.
- Trevor, I don't understand what the fuck you are talking about.

01:19:56.793 --> 01:19:58.468
I'm talking about your ex!

01:19:58.843 --> 01:19:59.677
Ivan.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:06.350
- Who? This guy standing next to you with a fish?
- I'm not in that photo.

01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:10.646
Trevor, I'm looking at a picture of you.

01:20:11.814 --> 01:20:14.484
You are stading next to some fat guy
with glasses holding a fish.

01:20:23.659 --> 01:20:24.786
That's not me.

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:34.420
Trevor, it's you.
Look.

01:20:41.886 --> 01:20:43.971
You lying whore.

01:20:48.392 --> 01:20:49.727
You get the fuck out.

01:20:49.762 --> 01:20:51.486
Fucking freak.

01:20:51.521 --> 01:20:53.606
You are a fucking pig

01:20:53.641 --> 01:20:55.656
You fucking whore

01:20:55.691 --> 01:20:58.485
You are a fucking freak.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.280
You are a fucking psycho.

01:21:01.315 --> 01:21:21.551
Fucking psycho

01:21:50.621 --> 01:21:53.416
Where is Marie?

01:21:53.451 --> 01:21:54.674
Who?

01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:57.718
You know who.

01:21:57.753 --> 01:22:00.805
Marie my waitress.

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.823
My! You are chatty tonight.

01:22:04.858 --> 01:22:08.806
Darling, I am your waitress!

01:22:08.841 --> 01:22:09.563
What's going on here?

01:22:09.598 --> 01:22:11.579
I've never seen you before.

01:22:11.614 --> 01:22:13.526
What are you talking about?

01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:18.774
You come here every night, stay on that same stool, staring at your coffee.

01:22:20.443 --> 01:22:24.030
Honest, I am starting to think that you are mute.

01:22:24.065 --> 01:22:26.664
I wanna see Marie!

01:22:26.699 --> 01:22:31.912
Mister, there is no Marie that works here.

01:22:34.331 --> 01:22:38.968
Is everybody at it?

01:22:39.003 --> 01:22:44.216
Let's have a laugh on Trevor.

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:48.262
Whatever Ivan was paying you is wasting his money.

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:52.304
Go home, Mister.

01:22:52.339 --> 01:22:56.312
Get some sleep.

01:24:21.730 --> 01:24:26.902
How could you!

01:25:47.316 --> 01:25:51.910
You have to pay your utility bill, partner

01:25:51.945 --> 01:25:56.950
You know how difficult it is to shave in the dark.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:26:02.164
What have you done with Nicholas?

01:26:02.831 --> 01:26:08.087
What have I done with Nicholas?

01:26:12.966 --> 01:26:18.180
He can't hear you now, pal.

01:26:19.473 --> 01:26:24.645
Oh, come on what know what you is dead. heya

01:26:27.773 --> 01:26:32.986
You going to do something with that faulty memory of yours. Pal

01:26:33.654 --> 01:26:37.331
Might make life a little bit easier.

01:26:37.366 --> 01:26:42.579
by the way, I just loved them no chilly myself

01:26:46.542 --> 01:26:51.755
That one on the refrigerator just kills me.

01:26:53.215 --> 01:26:58.428
Where is your hospitality, partner?

01:27:03.934 --> 01:27:09.189
If some had walked in, he might get the wrong idea.

01:29:17.651 --> 01:29:18.610
Who are you?

01:29:22.656 --> 01:29:25.242
Oh hell, look like you got
some explaining to do, partner.

01:30:30.599 --> 01:30:32.100
I know who you are.

01:32:42.730 --> 01:32:44.524
You going some where, Mr. Reznik?

01:32:46.818 --> 01:32:49.737
Yeah, Mrs.shrike, I'm moving.

01:32:50.655 --> 01:32:51.823
I didn't receive notice.

01:32:52.657 --> 01:32:55.493
Your lease requires you
to get 30 days notice in writing.

01:32:56.536 --> 01:32:58.997
It wasn't planned,
something came up.

01:32:59.747 --> 01:33:03.501
You can keep my security deposite.
I won't be needing it anyway.

01:33:06.921 --> 01:33:11.593
Really? Mr. Reznik.
You used to be such a good tenant.

01:33:12.969 --> 01:33:14.512
I just don't understand it.

01:33:27.650 --> 01:33:28.985
Oh, isn't that pretty?

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:33.740
Would you care to sell it?

01:33:36.451 --> 01:33:38.620
No, it was my mother's.

01:33:41.748 --> 01:33:46.669
I made all arrangements. Don't move my things.
A truck will be coming by this afternoon.

01:33:46.961 --> 01:33:47.712
You just want to get away...

01:33:48.087 --> 01:33:51.820
If you are going to give it away...

01:33:51.855 --> 01:33:55.553
Mrs. Shrike, If you'll excuse me.

01:34:53.361 --> 01:34:55.071
I like to report a hit-and-run.

01:35:11.337 --> 01:35:13.089
Some one will record your statement.

01:35:14.132 --> 01:35:19.762
Later, right now I just want to sleep.

01:35:28.354 --> 01:35:30.064
Just want to sleep.

01:35:31.305 --> 01:35:37.471
