00:33.680 --> 00:37.468
THE SHOOTER

01:19.240 --> 01:24.109
<i>Town Office, Hanne speaking.</i>
- I'm calling about my postal vote.

01:25.080 --> 01:31.792
<i>Social security number, please?</i>
- 271 166-1883.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.719
<i>One moment, please.</i>

01:36.760 --> 01:40.833
This election is important,
don't you agree?

01:42.280 --> 01:47.479
<i>Yes. Your vote has been registered.</i>
- Great. Thanks.

01:47.680 --> 01:50.831
The climate change in recent years
has made an impression on Danes.

01:51.040 --> 01:54.350
The opposition is thundering ahead ...

01:54.560 --> 01:56.835
... a 50% increase in oil prices.

01:57.040 --> 02:01.079
Denmark must drill for oil in the sea,
or Greenland will look elsewhere ...

02:01.280 --> 02:06.195
And now on to a hot subject
during this election.

02:06.400 --> 02:11.554
The oil drillings in Greenland. Should
or shouldn't we drill for oil there?

02:11.760 --> 02:12.875
Yes or no?

02:13.080 --> 02:17.232
Becoming independent of oil is the
greatest issue our generation faces.

02:17.440 --> 02:21.353
What are we talking about?
The survival of our planet.

02:21.560 --> 02:26.680
A reduced demand for oil isn't enough.
We must reduce the exploration.

02:26.880 --> 02:32.318
We won't allow Danish state companies
to drill for oil. That's for sure.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.112
The voters have spoken:

02:34.320 --> 02:39.474
Martin Felding is to form Denmark's
new green cabinet and may become PM.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.035
We'll release the roster on Tuesday.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.674
Are you the new climate
and energy minister?

02:44.880 --> 02:49.874
I'm very passionate about climate
issues, but let's wait and see.

02:50.080 --> 02:54.278
Thomas Borby, our new foreign minister?
- I can't comment on that.

02:54.480 --> 02:57.438
Welcome, Mia Moesgaard, political
commentator with the Morning Paper.

02:57.640 --> 03:00.837
Your comments
on the new government?

03:01.040 --> 03:03.554
It'll be interesting to see -

03:03.760 --> 03:08.390
if they can live up to the
climate policy that got them elected.

03:08.600 --> 03:13.879
7 MONTHS LATER

04:01.320 --> 04:02.799
Watching the news?
- I'm on my way up.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.752
Turn on your TV.

04:10.240 --> 04:14.870
We have reached an agreement today
between the Danish government -

04:15.080 --> 04:17.719
Greenland and the oil industry.

04:17.920 --> 04:21.230
Negotiations have taken place
behind closed doors -

04:21.440 --> 04:24.989
and come as a surprise to both
Danish and American commentators.

04:25.200 --> 04:29.239
The deal includes
a consortium and a climate fund.

04:29.440 --> 04:34.468
The consortium, made up of Denmark,
the US and Greenland, will be drilling -

04:34.680 --> 04:39.117
in North Greenland close to Station
North, Denmark's northern-most base.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.869
But Foreign Minister Thomas Borby is
more excited about the climate fund.

04:43.080 --> 04:46.675
Means derived from the oil profits
will be set aside for a fund -

04:46.880 --> 04:48.996
to protect the environment.

04:49.200 --> 04:54.513
Getting the US to commit to a green deal
makes me one happy foreign minister.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.235
The deal will make Denmark less
dependent on unstable oil states -

04:58.440 --> 05:03.673
and create more jobs, according
to the government's press release.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.792
A trilateral treaty will be ratified
on Friday in Copenhagen.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.357
The American foreign minister will stop
in Copenhagen on her European tour -

05:11.560 --> 05:14.552
to throw light on the deal.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.512
MONDAY

05:54.720 --> 05:58.235
Denmark is dependent
on military alliances in the Arctic.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.396
Only <i>we</i> saw this coming.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.275
Mia did the research, and
she should have a go at the minister.

06:04.480 --> 06:08.314
When is she leaving?
- Tomorrow.

06:08.520 --> 06:13.196
But this is going to be a hot topic
until they ratify the treaty on Friday.

06:14.760 --> 06:19.072
I'm leaving tomorrow.
- Guess you'll bring the kid round?

06:19.280 --> 06:22.397
You like kids?
- Sure.

06:24.200 --> 06:29.593
This is the worst time possible.
DR wants you on Deadline.

06:29.800 --> 06:35.591
I need you. You're the best. It's all
about the government's flip flop.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.717
It's a debate with Thomas Borby.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.753
Give him hell.
Ask him why they lied.

06:43.680 --> 06:48.151
I have to pack.
- I'll pack your suitcase for you.

06:49.280 --> 06:53.990
It's not such a bad thing
to leave packing a victory.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.475
Mia ...

06:57.320 --> 07:00.118
I'll do it.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.275
Here you go.
- Thanks.

07:26.840 --> 07:32.995
You're on maternity leave now.
- I have to get used to that phrase.

07:33.200 --> 07:38.228
Have you had time to prepare?
- I've done my best.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.749
So you're ready?

07:41.960 --> 07:45.999
Well, I've packed 36 boxes of formula.

07:46.200 --> 07:51.354
Toys, baby clothes and some gifts
for the women at the orphanage.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.711
I just got off the phone with them.
They're ready for you.

07:54.920 --> 08:00.119
You have a court appointment there on
Friday, and then you'll get to meet her.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.435
Yes.

08:12.360 --> 08:16.512
<i>Welcome to Copenhagen.</i>
<i>The local time is 2: 15 p.m.</i>

08:47.120 --> 08:49.759
Let me, Dad.

09:11.920 --> 09:15.993
My guests in this debate are
political commentator Mia Moesgaard -

09:16.200 --> 09:22.196
and Foreign Minister Thomas Borby.
Let's go over the facts.

09:22.400 --> 09:27.633
Here, in North Eastern Greenland,
deep below the sea is our new oil field.

09:27.840 --> 09:32.994
Albeit no new North Sea adventure,
the government says it's promising.

09:33.200 --> 09:38.832
Mia Moesgaard, you're skeptical about
Thomas Borby's deal with the US. Why?

09:39.040 --> 09:43.750
You win an election on a green agenda.
A year later you go back on all that.

09:43.960 --> 09:47.953
Peter Hostrup has made it clear ...
- The government's climate expert.

09:48.160 --> 09:53.029
This deal enables us, by using the oil
there, to convert to green energy -

09:53.240 --> 09:59.395
on a scale otherwise unimaginable
in the light of the global crisis.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.955
The deal creates new Danish jobs -

10:02.160 --> 10:06.312
and makes us independent
of unstable oil states.

10:06.520 --> 10:12.038
Moesgaard, this deal sounds
like a win-win situation.

10:12.240 --> 10:16.279
But they were elected on the promise
of not going anywhere near that oil -

10:16.480 --> 10:19.472
and their arguments were -

10:19.680 --> 10:24.549
that rising CO2 emissions pose a
threat globally and not just to Denmark.

10:24.760 --> 10:29.914
I think many people would say you're
lobotomizing democracy, Thomas Borby.

10:30.120 --> 10:34.875
Are you lobotomizing democracy, Borby?
- That's an insane allegation.

10:35.080 --> 10:40.598
Negotiations have been steamrolled -

10:40.800 --> 10:43.633
over the heads of the voters -

10:43.840 --> 10:48.516
and the ensuing frustration
may result in violent reactions.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.870
Should you have given it more time?

10:51.080 --> 10:57.269
Violent reactions as in extreme?
- I didn't say that.

10:57.480 --> 11:01.678
Are you encouraging riots
or worse?

11:03.160 --> 11:08.029
I didn't say that, Thomas Borby.
- No, but you thought it.

11:08.240 --> 11:14.190
Mia Moesgaard, are you in fact
encouraging riots and violent methods -

11:14.400 --> 11:17.551
as part of a political struggle?
Is that your job as a reporter ...

11:17.760 --> 11:23.039
No, but you can't disregard the way
Danish voters feel right now.

11:23.240 --> 11:29.713
History has shown repeatedly that voters
who feel muzzled shout louder.

11:29.920 --> 11:34.948
We'll see if anyone takes you up
on that. Thank you both for coming.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.836
<i>You did great.</i>
- I was vague and too personal.

11:57.040 --> 11:59.838
<i>No, you were sharp and passionate.</i>

12:00.040 --> 12:04.158
Stop by on your way to the airport.
- Sure.

12:41.200 --> 12:45.955
Mia Moesgaard.
<i>- How dare you?</i>

12:46.160 --> 12:49.436
Excuse me?
<i>- Encouraging violence on TV?</i>

12:49.640 --> 12:52.916
<i>Shame on you.</i>
- But ...

12:53.920 --> 12:56.559
Hello?

13:47.080 --> 13:50.117
Shortly after meeting
with the American foreign minister -

13:50.320 --> 13:54.108
Thomas Borby met with three other
principle players behind the oil deal:

13:54.320 --> 13:58.074
Environmental expert Peter Hostrup,
Climate and Energy Minister Løvschall -

13:58.280 --> 14:04.310
and Steen Birger Brask, Dan Oil.
Critics dub them the Oil Quartet.

14:07.240 --> 14:11.870
Hey, Sis.
- Leaving tomorrow?

14:12.080 --> 14:14.594
Yes.
Don't you have school tomorrow?

14:14.800 --> 14:19.078
You're never home, so we wanted
to catch you before your trip.

14:20.640 --> 14:23.029
We've got a gift for the new cousin.

14:24.840 --> 14:29.789
I just saw Deadline.
Thomas was really far out.

14:30.680 --> 14:34.514
Can we bring the pictures?
- Sure.

14:34.720 --> 14:39.669
This is for the baby,
and this is your baby shower gift.

14:39.880 --> 14:44.590
I haven't even left yet.
- No, but you're on maternity leave.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.952
Can we play on your computer?
- Sure, if you know how to switch it on.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.711
She's so cute.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.556
Are you nervous?

15:06.160 --> 15:09.914
I was so scared
when I was expecting my first child.

15:10.120 --> 15:13.192
I imagined -

15:13.400 --> 15:17.871
I'd give birth to some weird monster.

15:22.560 --> 15:25.393
Everything's going to be alright.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.919
Sure.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.588
I'm getting cold.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.158
TUESDAY

15:49.000 --> 15:54.028
I haven't quite got it.
- Relax your shoulder.

15:58.720 --> 16:02.759
Hell, Rasmus.
Long time.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.757
One year, Detlev.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.713
Come see our new gear.

16:11.520 --> 16:15.911
Look at this.
It's a Sabatti rifle, and I modified it.

16:16.800 --> 16:21.237
I'm pretty pleased with the result.
Let me show you the ammo.

16:21.960 --> 16:23.757
300 Whisper.

16:23.960 --> 16:26.269
Feel it.

16:26.480 --> 16:32.237
All the instructors want to borrow it.
We don't own it officially.

16:32.440 --> 16:35.477
You want to cancel your subscription?
<i>- Yes!</i>

16:35.680 --> 16:37.671
Hello?

16:37.880 --> 16:41.509
Mia, please don't scare off all the
subscribers. They do pay our salary.

16:41.720 --> 16:45.633
Stupid people can grab
a free paper on the subway.

16:45.840 --> 16:48.912
Back in the day they had
400 papers in New York alone.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.953
We may not always have
three morning papers in Denmark.

16:52.160 --> 16:56.676
We're doing a background feature
on civil disobedience.

16:56.880 --> 17:01.908
The Resistance, the anti-nuclear
marches, '68, Greenpeace, squatters -

17:02.120 --> 17:07.114
G8, COP 15, and now
the resistance to the Arctic drillings.

17:07.319 --> 17:10.278
I liked your little showdown
with Borby last night.

17:10.480 --> 17:14.678
We've got the government up against
the wall. How do we keep our edge?

17:14.880 --> 17:17.109
Raise the issue of democracy.

17:17.319 --> 17:20.232
Go into the environmental hazards,
the horse-trade.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.876
Does the US need the climate fund?
No, but the Danish government does.

17:24.079 --> 17:27.277
So we put the pressure on the
government and Thomas Borby.

17:29.040 --> 17:32.316
When is your flight?
- I'm being picked up in ten.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.671
I want you back in the ring with him.
- No.

17:35.880 --> 17:39.316
The way he dodged the issue
and made you out to be a terrorist -

17:39.520 --> 17:42.751
proves you're on to something.
You can't just up and leave.

17:42.960 --> 17:46.157
You have a chance to change
the course of history.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.555
Just stay until Thursday.

17:48.760 --> 17:52.548
You'll get plenty of time with your kid
and oatmeal and dirty diapers.

17:52.760 --> 17:55.115
I think Mia's got the message.

17:55.320 --> 18:00.394
This is our chance to prove ourselves
as more than intellectual darlings.

18:00.600 --> 18:04.036
Hey, fight for it.
Just until Thursday, okay?

18:06.360 --> 18:09.750
Fight for it, Steffen!

18:11.280 --> 18:15.319
You know how happy I am for you.

18:15.520 --> 18:19.433
I don't have kids of my own,
but it must be wonderful.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.959
Get to the point.

18:21.160 --> 18:26.393
I checked the flights this morning,
and there's one for Kolkata on Thursday.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.232
Your sister's here.

18:37.880 --> 18:41.998
It's a lot to ask, but we're buying.
First-class, peanuts, white wine -

18:42.200 --> 18:46.478
and you won't arrive
with swollen ankles. What do you say?

18:49.240 --> 18:51.959
<i>You may not make it there in time.</i>

18:52.160 --> 18:56.233
If you miss that court appointment,
someone else will get the baby.

18:56.440 --> 19:02.276
But I'm going to arrive Thursday night.
<i>- You need to be rested.</i>

19:02.480 --> 19:08.237
I'm used to tight deadlines.
I'll sleep on the plane. I'll be ready.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.750
Have you made up your mind?

19:14.400 --> 19:18.439
Yes.
I'm going to leave on Thursday.

19:18.640 --> 19:23.509
<i>You're going to leave on Thursday.</i>
- Thanks.

20:43.120 --> 20:46.715
The foreign minister
will see you shortly.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.039
Mia Moesgaard.
<i>- Hello.</i>

20:55.240 --> 21:00.155
You don't know me, but I saw you on TV,
and you said something important.

21:00.360 --> 21:04.797
<i>I've got some info for you.</i>
- Who is this?

21:05.000 --> 21:10.632
<i>I agree with you.</i>
- Thanks, but please tell me your name.

21:10.840 --> 21:16.597
<i>It's time to act. The government's</i>
<i>lying about the quantities.</i>

21:16.800 --> 21:21.032
Please tell me your name,
or I can't talk to you.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.913
<i>I thought I'd return your plants.</i>

21:27.120 --> 21:29.031
Your plants.
- Sure.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.117
<i>Hello?</i>
- Sorry.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.230
Anything wrong?
- No.

21:35.440 --> 21:38.113
Thanks for seeing me.
- Any time.

21:40.480 --> 21:43.392
I've repotted them.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.637
They won't do it by themselves.

21:46.840 --> 21:51.038
They're plants.
They haven't got any arms.

21:51.240 --> 21:55.472
This one's got a little baby.

22:01.880 --> 22:06.590
Anyway ... thanks
for letting me look after them.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.950
No, thank <i>you.</i>

22:24.280 --> 22:29.229
Thanks. I thought you were
all set to go away and become a mom?

22:30.640 --> 22:34.633
Well, we just opened the debate,
so let's finish it.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.951
Can I tape this?

22:58.760 --> 23:02.833
Remember Schröder?
- Schröder?

23:03.040 --> 23:07.352
He took pictures of us
in order to document police violence.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.075
I found this in my drawer.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.829
18 May, 1993.
The Maastricht Treaty.

23:15.040 --> 23:18.157
That's you throwing that brick,
isn't it?

23:27.920 --> 23:32.755
You do know what'll happen,
if you print that?

23:32.960 --> 23:38.080
Don't pull cheap tricks on me
like you did last night on Deadline.

23:39.960 --> 23:45.318
Do you intend to print that picture?
- Of course not.

23:50.840 --> 23:55.595
Let's agree that that was then,
and we've both moved on since.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.314
Okay.

24:01.160 --> 24:04.197
Let's talk politics.
- Let's.

24:05.880 --> 24:09.555
So give me something.
- Mia, look.

24:09.760 --> 24:15.790
You know politics better than most.
We choose our battles. It's not easy.

24:18.640 --> 24:22.838
We didn't go to the polls on our
climate policy. It won us the election -

24:23.040 --> 24:25.873
but we'll be judged
on our welfare policy.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.675
So anyone can be pro-climate,
as long as it doesn't hurt welfare?

24:29.880 --> 24:32.599
Can I quote you on that?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.036
Of course not.

24:36.240 --> 24:41.792
We're convinced this deal was drafted
with the US during the campaign.

24:43.680 --> 24:48.834
You may think we aren't friends anymore.
- Let's not mix things up.

24:52.400 --> 24:56.518
When did you start negotiations
with the Americans?

24:59.600 --> 25:03.718
If this isn't
a new North Sea adventure -

25:03.920 --> 25:08.152
what's in it for the Americans?

25:10.360 --> 25:13.875
No further comments.

25:23.880 --> 25:27.793
Today's peaceful rally
against the oil deal -

25:28.000 --> 25:30.912
was marred by a few troublemakers.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.680
The police had to intervene -

25:33.880 --> 25:38.795
when protesters started
throwing fireworks and bottles.

25:57.800 --> 26:03.557
The police have arrested
20-25 protesters.

26:03.760 --> 26:06.718
Friday sees
the ratification of the oil deal ...

26:06.920 --> 26:08.911
Peter!

26:10.680 --> 26:15.993
Are you okay?
- Look where you're going, man!

26:16.200 --> 26:20.830
I was looking! You're riding with a kid.
Maybe you ought to be more careful.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.912
What's going on?

26:36.600 --> 26:40.275
Get out of here!
- Let go!

26:59.880 --> 27:03.998
THOMAS BORBY WON'T COMMENT

27:33.440 --> 27:38.833
Environmental expert Peter Hostrup
was shot at outside his home today.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.156
Nobody was hurt -

27:41.360 --> 27:46.514
but the police say shots fired at his
car came from a high-caliber weapon.

27:46.720 --> 27:50.759
The police have no suspects, but as
Hostrup is part of the Oil Quartet -

27:50.960 --> 27:55.033
the shooting could be related to the
public outrage against the deal -

27:55.240 --> 27:58.391
which is being ratified on Friday.

27:59.360 --> 28:03.239
Mia, follow up.
- I've seen it.

28:09.720 --> 28:13.633
Do they know who took the shots?

28:15.840 --> 28:21.119
Mia Moesgaard.
<i>- I'm sorry I hung up the other day.</i>

28:21.320 --> 28:25.598
Who are you?
<i>- Heard the news about Peter Hostrup?</i>

28:25.800 --> 28:31.079
Yes.
<i>- I've got some info for you.</i>

28:32.480 --> 28:38.555
Can we meet?
<i>- The Jaguar Bar on Holmbladsgade.</i>

28:42.480 --> 28:46.234
Where are you going?
- I'll be back in an hour.

29:15.320 --> 29:18.198
Don't look at me.
Just go.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.960
Just keep driving.

29:25.200 --> 29:28.317
We must get the government
to call off the drilling.

29:28.520 --> 29:31.512
We must tell the public
about the quantities below the sea.

29:31.720 --> 29:34.188
What do you mean "we"?

29:35.720 --> 29:39.190
Sorry, but you can't use your phone.
I'm going to keep it here.

29:39.400 --> 29:43.075
What do you want?
- I want you to do your job.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.714
Tell the public what they need to know.

29:45.920 --> 29:50.550
That deal is a standard corporate deal.

29:50.760 --> 29:55.629
No, the politicians and the
oil companies are deceiving us.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.076
Print this.

29:59.280 --> 30:04.149
Maps showing the fields and quantities
in our deal with the US.

30:04.360 --> 30:08.069
Print the climate tables too
against the deposits.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.396
How?

30:22.120 --> 30:25.351
"Tipping point diagrams."
- It's a great story.

30:25.560 --> 30:29.951
CO2 surveys, gas and oil deposits ...
He thinks we're going to print this?

30:30.160 --> 30:34.551
Climate terrorist goes vigilante.
- We're calling him a terrorist?

30:34.760 --> 30:37.911
Environmental activist then.
If it is him.

30:38.120 --> 30:41.829
If we write about this, we might end up
hoping he'll carry out his threat.

30:42.040 --> 30:46.636
Mia's the only one in the country
in contact with him. It's a scoop.

30:46.840 --> 30:49.832
We need to get an interview.
- He shot a climate expert.

30:50.040 --> 30:53.749
No, he punctured two tires
and shattered a side-view mirror.

30:53.960 --> 30:59.239
Are you sure this isn't just some loony
out to get his 15 minutes of fame?

30:59.440 --> 31:04.434
He called me before shots were fired at
Peter Hostrup. He didn't say his name.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.473
Sure it was him?
- Pretty sure.

31:09.280 --> 31:14.513
We have a kick-ass exclusive here.
Let's print excerpts of this ...

31:14.720 --> 31:19.555
We may have an exclusive in which
Mia provided the ideological fuel -

31:19.760 --> 31:22.718
for a potential terrorist,
about to open fire in the streets.

31:22.920 --> 31:25.229
Terrorist?
- That doesn't hurt the story.

31:25.440 --> 31:29.479
No, but it might blow up in our face,
if we're not careful.

31:29.680 --> 31:33.798
Go get the editor-in-chief's permission.
- Shut the fuck up.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.312
Hvid is away, so I make the decisions.
- You sure do.

31:38.520 --> 31:43.514
Let's find a number cruncher for this.
- I'll call Holger.

31:43.720 --> 31:49.317
And, Mia, look into the possibility
for an interview with the shooter.

31:49.520 --> 31:53.798
I'll never call you a wuss again.
You're a modern-day newspaperman.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.992
You call the shots.
- Jesper, you're fired.

31:57.200 --> 32:00.590
I should've asked for his number.
- Your ticket is ready.

32:00.800 --> 32:04.554
I keep my promises,
and I appreciate this.

32:05.160 --> 32:10.314
<i>North Eastern Greenland is a risky</i>
<i>area because of ice and isolation.</i>

32:10.520 --> 32:16.197
But this summer the Arctic may be free
of ice, posing an even bigger problem.

32:16.400 --> 32:19.312
No ice will give easy access to the oil.

32:19.520 --> 32:24.355
<i>If there are huge quantities,</i>
<i>which there in theory could be -</i>

32:24.560 --> 32:28.792
it will mean higher CO2 emissions
and escalate the situation.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.709
<i>Extreme weather conditions are</i>
<i>becoming a global problem.</i>

32:32.920 --> 32:36.959
And Borby's climate fund ...
<i>- What about it?</i>

32:37.160 --> 32:41.438
In my book he has a double agenda.

32:41.640 --> 32:45.918
<i>He wants to shift</i>
<i>public focus to a positive thing.</i>

32:46.120 --> 32:49.874
A drilling hole is a drilling hole.
I smell big-time politics.

32:50.080 --> 32:55.632
Thanks, Holger. See you tomorrow.
<i>- See you. Bye.</i>

33:23.280 --> 33:26.477
Mia Moesgaard.
<i>- Sorry to bother you.</i>

33:26.680 --> 33:32.835
<i>Why don't you write I contacted you?</i>
<i>Why don't you publish my reports?</i>

33:33.040 --> 33:35.395
We only met a few hours ago.

33:35.600 --> 33:38.876
Just hold my figures
up against the politicians'.

33:39.080 --> 33:43.471
<i>We're double-checking your info.</i>

33:43.680 --> 33:48.435
You shoot and bring people in mortal
danger. Why should they listen to you?

33:50.640 --> 33:54.952
Why shouldn't they?
I think they will.

33:57.760 --> 34:00.832
Can I interview you?
<i>- No.</i>

34:01.040 --> 34:03.235
I'm not important.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.431
Hold my figures
up against the politicians'.

34:05.640 --> 34:08.518
<i>Let the public decide.</i>

34:10.000 --> 34:14.471
You can't make demands on me
nor my paper unless you cooperate.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.835
The clock is ticking.

34:34.080 --> 34:37.197
WEDNESDAY

34:43.760 --> 34:45.909
Good morning.

34:48.440 --> 34:49.668
Bye.

34:49.880 --> 34:53.395
Frida, let's go home.

35:58.440 --> 36:01.830
Christian!

36:03.840 --> 36:06.070
Christian Løvschall,
are you happy -

36:06.280 --> 36:10.478
with your ministry's influence
on the climate deal with the US?

36:10.680 --> 36:15.231
It's a green deal,
and we're very happy with that.

36:17.520 --> 36:20.080
What's up?

36:23.160 --> 36:26.232
Is it the deal you wished for?

36:26.440 --> 36:30.592
The environment is a top priority
in the deal -

36:30.800 --> 36:34.236
and we're very happy with that.

36:37.720 --> 36:42.430
WHAT'S IN IT FOR THE USA?

36:53.840 --> 36:56.195
POLICE

37:36.200 --> 37:41.320
We have to tell parents their children
have been shot at. This isn't Denmark.

37:41.520 --> 37:45.832
The shooting incident took place
less than an hour ago in Copenhagen.

37:46.040 --> 37:50.158
We were walking along with the children,
and then we met the lady with the dog -

37:50.360 --> 37:54.433
and the children wanted to pat the
dog, and suddenly we hear a crack.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.473
They're calling him a terrorist.
Did he call?

38:12.080 --> 38:18.599
Rasmus?
- I've run out. Can you spare a little?

38:19.520 --> 38:23.991
You're in luck.
I was about to wash a load myself.

38:33.120 --> 38:38.592
Let's hear your expert opinion, Holger.
- We're looking at huge quantities.

38:38.800 --> 38:43.078
How huge?
- Very huge. If these figures are true.

38:43.280 --> 38:46.078
Some of it looks confidential.
Where did you get it?

38:46.280 --> 38:48.350
Sorry, my source is anonymous.

38:48.560 --> 38:52.678
Sum it up for me. How huge?
- I need time to work it out.

38:52.880 --> 38:56.919
I'll get you some coffee. Milk?
- No, black.

38:58.120 --> 39:01.829
Hvid is "pondering"
and reading up on the press laws.

39:02.040 --> 39:06.556
Pondering my ass. Our only problem is
that we haven't written about it yet!

39:06.760 --> 39:10.036
Someone who's been in contact with
our paper is on a shooting rampage.

39:10.240 --> 39:12.037
How did this contact come about?

39:12.240 --> 39:14.196
He called Mia and said
someone had to act.

39:14.400 --> 39:18.029
After the Hostrup shooting he called
back, and she tried to reason with him.

39:18.240 --> 39:22.028
Obviously in vain.
- Did Mia contact him?

39:22.240 --> 39:26.233
She's met him.
It's her job.

39:26.440 --> 39:31.070
If he calls again, we're going to try to
set up an interview. This story is hot.

39:31.280 --> 39:35.592
We aren't at liberty to protect a source
who risks over four years of prison.

39:36.960 --> 39:40.873
He shot a dog, for Christ's sake.
You don't get four years for that.

39:41.080 --> 39:44.470
We met with a man who attacks
politicians, and we hushed it up.

39:44.680 --> 39:48.434
No one is ever going to give us
another story, if they go to the police.

39:48.640 --> 39:52.155
Mia, your phone.

39:53.520 --> 39:54.589
Shit!

39:54.800 --> 40:00.193
It's of interest to our readers.
- Sure, but we mustn't politicize.

40:00.400 --> 40:04.188
Mia, they want you on Debate Night.
- Who else?

40:04.400 --> 40:06.675
The climate and energy minister.
- Gutsy.

40:06.880 --> 40:10.350
Steen Birger Brask from Dan Oil
and a Greenpeace spokesman.

40:10.560 --> 40:12.278
We'll do it.

40:12.480 --> 40:16.314
Hvid isn't sure about our contact with
the shooter, so we'll have to stall.

40:16.520 --> 40:20.957
Stall? Well, that'll sell
a shitload of papers!

40:21.880 --> 40:24.189
Coffee.
- Thanks.

40:28.080 --> 40:31.311
My source mentioned
the finance ministry.

40:31.520 --> 40:34.956
What does it mean that the decision to
drill was made in the finance ministry?

40:35.160 --> 40:40.154
Well, 76% of the state oil company
are owned by the finance ministry.

40:41.160 --> 40:43.116
Who's strongest?

40:43.320 --> 40:47.359
The climate and energy minister
or the finance minister?

40:48.360 --> 40:52.399
The same person shot
at Peter Hostrup and Kiki Løvschall.

40:52.600 --> 40:57.674
He's a good marksman,
so we've looked at rifle clubs.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.916
War veterans.

41:00.120 --> 41:03.476
We've infiltrated
the militant activists -

41:03.680 --> 41:06.990
but haven't come across
these methods.

41:07.720 --> 41:12.316
We're probably looking
at a single-issue activist -

41:12.520 --> 41:15.273
and that means
he could be anyone.

41:27.760 --> 41:30.354
You're not worried, are you?

41:30.560 --> 41:34.872
If we <i>are</i> on this madman's hit list,
as the intelligence service believes.

41:35.080 --> 41:40.393
I don't know. I've never tried
anything like this before.

41:40.600 --> 41:44.718
No. Well, I've been posted
in both Brazil and Nigeria.

41:44.920 --> 41:48.196
There, death threats come with the job.

41:48.400 --> 41:51.995
Usually they're just out
to rattle our cage.

41:52.200 --> 41:56.239
And I have bodyguards,
so I'll be fine.

41:56.440 --> 41:57.668
Sure.

42:02.920 --> 42:06.435
40 activists were arrested
after the pincer movement.

42:06.640 --> 42:11.668
Still the situation escalated,
and an hour ago 60 more ...

42:11.880 --> 42:13.916
Excuse me.

42:15.720 --> 42:18.598
Mia Moesgaard.
- They listen to you.

42:20.840 --> 42:25.630
What's all that racket?
- People listen to you.

42:28.400 --> 42:32.075
Can I interview you?
<i>- Now?</i>

42:32.280 --> 42:34.589
No, face to face.

42:35.520 --> 42:37.750
Maybe.

42:39.280 --> 42:41.316
Hello?

42:42.320 --> 42:47.633
... as extensive as the riots after
the Maastricht Treaty vote in 1993.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.796
Yes.
<i>- It's Holger.</i>

42:50.000 --> 42:55.154
If I say 900 million cubic meters ...
- Is that a lot?

42:55.360 --> 42:59.319
It's three times Denmark's current
oil reserves in the North Sea.

42:59.520 --> 43:02.717
<i>We're talking gigantic quantities.</i>

43:02.920 --> 43:05.514
Thanks, Holger.

43:10.360 --> 43:14.990
Don't use those figures. We need
two independent verified sources.

43:15.200 --> 43:18.510
Two sources. We know Holger, but
we don't know the other guy, damn it.

43:18.720 --> 43:23.748
Stick to the subject,
but don't wave any figures about.

43:32.560 --> 43:38.999
Nørrebro is a battleground,
and several arrests have been made.

43:41.800 --> 43:44.030
Let me remind you -

43:44.240 --> 43:48.472
that the American foreign minister
is flying in in two days -

43:48.680 --> 43:51.877
to ratify the oil treaty.

43:52.080 --> 43:56.153
Mia Moesgaard should tell
her henchmen ...

43:56.360 --> 43:58.635
Oh, come on!

43:58.840 --> 44:01.957
... that these acts of violence
are unacceptable.

44:02.160 --> 44:06.995
Mia Moesgaard, your part in all this ...
Don't you feel responsible at all?

44:07.200 --> 44:11.637
No. I find the situation alarming too -

44:11.840 --> 44:15.310
and I respect the climate minister
for participating today.

44:15.520 --> 44:18.159
But it's my job as a reporter -

44:18.360 --> 44:21.750
to ask the politicians the questions
the voters want answered.

44:21.960 --> 44:26.351
Like this: How much oil did you find?
- Løvschall.

44:26.560 --> 44:28.835
I can't say exactly -

44:29.040 --> 44:32.157
but the quantities are big enough -

44:32.360 --> 44:36.148
for us to uphold our end of the deal.

44:36.360 --> 44:39.989
How many cubic meters?

44:43.040 --> 44:45.429
Christian Løvschall, care to answer?

44:45.640 --> 44:48.996
Attempts to pinpoint exact figures -

44:49.200 --> 44:53.876
are always bound to fail.

44:54.080 --> 44:58.358
I trust the experts when they say
the quantities aren't huge.

44:58.560 --> 45:02.678
What do the Americans
get in return for the fund?

45:02.880 --> 45:05.792
A piece of the Danish oil revenues?

45:35.560 --> 45:38.438
Want to talk somewhere else?

45:42.040 --> 45:43.996
No.

46:04.320 --> 46:06.311
Going somewhere?

46:08.960 --> 46:11.190
Sit down.

46:16.800 --> 46:20.713
I'll record it ...
- No, please take notes.

46:33.840 --> 46:38.960
What the hell do you hope to achieve
by shooting at a group of children?

46:39.160 --> 46:42.948
I was sure I wouldn't hit them.

46:44.280 --> 46:49.229
How does it help your cause
that you're branded a terrorist now?

47:04.320 --> 47:07.790
What do you have to say?

47:08.000 --> 47:10.355
It's violence.

47:12.040 --> 47:14.998
Even if it's far away.

47:15.200 --> 47:18.237
Even if it affects
someone we don't know.

47:18.440 --> 47:22.991
Violence?
- Caused by our oil exploration.

47:24.040 --> 47:25.758
A child -

47:25.960 --> 47:32.035
in Cambodia, Thailand,
India or Bangladesh, drowns.

47:33.280 --> 47:37.478
Or falls ill.
Because of flooding.

47:45.360 --> 47:48.875
900 million cubic meters?

47:49.080 --> 47:53.710
I've double-checked your info.
Where did you get it?

47:54.880 --> 47:58.998
Are you employed in the oil industry?
- I can't reveal my identity.

47:59.200 --> 48:02.875
But the quantities are correct,
and I want you to write about them.

48:03.080 --> 48:07.153
While you're busy shooting more dogs?
- No.

48:07.360 --> 48:11.512
What then?
When are you going to stop?

48:16.880 --> 48:21.032
I'm going to stop
when the deal is annulled.

48:34.200 --> 48:36.555
I can't.

48:40.080 --> 48:43.311
I can't have you visiting me here.

48:44.600 --> 48:47.433
I want you to leave.
I'm sorry.

49:05.520 --> 49:11.197
You're not the type who lies on rooftops
taking shots at people.

49:12.160 --> 49:15.277
You didn't plan for it to go this far.

49:16.960 --> 49:20.714
Unless you stop now, you're going
to help the people you oppose.

49:20.920 --> 49:23.514
Don't you see?

49:37.000 --> 49:39.514
Thanks for the coffee.

49:45.640 --> 49:49.030
So I don't think
you remember what I look like.

49:53.720 --> 49:59.158
Okay?
- This meeting never took place.

50:16.200 --> 50:19.317
THURSDAY

50:24.800 --> 50:27.917
Jesper, the interview's off.
Sorry.

50:28.120 --> 50:33.035
We have a visitor. They're waiting
for you in Steffen's office.

50:41.960 --> 50:46.829
Mia. This is Adam Larsen from
the Security and Intelligence Service.

50:47.040 --> 50:51.352
This is Mia Moesgaard
who's been in contact with the suspect.

50:53.920 --> 50:57.833
We need help with our investigation.
Do you recognize this voice?

50:58.520 --> 51:02.718
<i>Why don't you print the documents</i>
<i>I entrusted your paper?</i>

51:02.920 --> 51:07.994
<i>Come forward and we'll talk. I won't</i>
<i>waste my time on it, unless you do.</i>

51:08.200 --> 51:11.033
<i>This isn't your time,</i>
<i>Steffen Husfeldt.</i>

51:11.240 --> 51:17.076
<i>Look at the clock and do as I say.</i>
<i>- Don't you threaten me.</i>

51:17.280 --> 51:20.955
Is it him?
- He called you?

51:21.160 --> 51:25.153
Can you confirm this is the man?
- Yes.

51:25.360 --> 51:28.989
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- Sure.

51:29.200 --> 51:33.910
When he got into your car,
could you tell how tall he was?

51:34.120 --> 51:38.716
Normal height, I guess.
- Normal height.

51:38.920 --> 51:42.754
You've got a Peugeot 306. If his head
was 10 cm from the roof -

51:42.960 --> 51:46.430
that makes him about 180 cm.
Would you call that normal height?

51:46.640 --> 51:49.837
Sure, 180?

51:50.040 --> 51:52.918
Did you see his face?

51:56.720 --> 51:58.472
No.

52:00.720 --> 52:06.033
He was wearing a hoodie,
so I couldn't see his face.

52:48.200 --> 52:50.873
I knocked several times.

52:51.080 --> 52:54.595
I found that metal thing in your pocket.

52:54.800 --> 52:58.713
You really should remember
to empty your pockets.

53:29.800 --> 53:32.917
I'll drop you off at the airport.

53:34.280 --> 53:37.875
May I?
- That would be great.

54:03.280 --> 54:06.989
<i>Look at the clock and do as I say.</i>
<i>- Don't you threaten me.</i>

54:07.200 --> 54:10.749
We filtered out the background noise
and may be on to something.

54:10.960 --> 54:15.351
This church bell.
It's a single-clang profile.

54:15.560 --> 54:19.997
If we compare it with,
say, the Church of our Lady -

54:20.200 --> 54:22.236
look at the reading.

54:22.440 --> 54:28.879
All church bells have their own distinct
profile. This is a double clang.

54:29.080 --> 54:33.995
We're looking for a single-clang profile
like the one in the conversation.

54:34.200 --> 54:37.909
How many churches fit that profile?
- In Copenhagen?

54:38.120 --> 54:39.712
78.

54:58.480 --> 55:01.916
I think ...

55:02.760 --> 55:05.797
Hey.
<i>- Hi, it's me.</i>

55:06.000 --> 55:09.072
<i>Where do you think I am?</i>
- On your way to the airport, I hope.

55:09.280 --> 55:14.673
I am.
<i>- I can't wait to see you both.</i>

55:14.880 --> 55:17.599
Me too.
<i>- Have a good trip.</i>

55:17.800 --> 55:22.590
Kiss the others from me. And thanks.
<i>- Bye.</i>

55:22.800 --> 55:27.999
Forget all about us now and think only
of yourself and your little girl.

55:33.160 --> 55:36.550
A packed lunch?
- On home-baked rye.

57:10.400 --> 57:14.075
It's Christian's Church on the tape.
We know the time -

57:14.280 --> 57:19.559
and we've collected over
ten surveillance tapes from the area.

57:19.760 --> 57:22.991
Two tapes show passers-by
talking on the phone.

57:23.200 --> 57:28.069
One shows a man dumping his phone
at the end of Langebrogade. Add sound.

57:28.280 --> 57:33.434
<i>Look at the clock and do as I say.</i>
- Heavyset, 40-45 years.

57:33.640 --> 57:36.200
Can we get a better view of his face?

57:39.920 --> 57:41.638
Sorry.

57:41.840 --> 57:44.149
Get this material to the media -

57:44.360 --> 57:48.114
and go to Langebrogade
and find out if anyone's seen anything.

57:48.320 --> 57:51.835
There's been a shooting at Dan Oil.
One dead.

57:52.040 --> 57:57.672
<i>K7 49 to Kolkata,</i>
<i>please proceed to gate B42.</i>

57:59.400 --> 58:01.960
Mia Moesgaard?
- Yes.

58:02.160 --> 58:05.994
Michael Smith, the Security
and Intelligence Service. Follow us.

58:06.200 --> 58:11.069
I have to be on this plane.
- You're detained. Passport, please.

58:14.000 --> 58:18.790
We're conducting
a terrorism investigation. Come along.

58:20.080 --> 58:22.833
Don't touch me.

58:32.960 --> 58:36.430
A bodyguard was killed
and Steen Birger Brask wounded -

58:36.640 --> 58:42.431
in the shooting at Dan Oil today.
The authorities have a suspect:

58:42.640 --> 58:46.997
This isn't your time.
Look at the clock and do as I say.

58:47.200 --> 58:51.478
The police just released the
surveillance tape and the conversation -

58:51.680 --> 58:55.719
with the suspect
behind the recent shootings.

58:55.920 --> 59:00.436
The police would like to talk to anyone
who can assist in identifying the man.

59:00.640 --> 59:05.236
The suspect looks Danish,
about 180 cm tall, heavyset -

59:05.440 --> 59:10.434
about 45 years old
and wears a green parka with a hood.

59:27.640 --> 59:29.915
Rasmus Holm Jensen, 46.

59:30.120 --> 59:33.396
Single-issue activist.
Unknown to us.

59:33.600 --> 59:38.879
Described as intelligent,
shy and polite.

59:39.080 --> 59:42.789
A bodyguard was killed and
Steen Birger Brask was wounded -

59:43.000 --> 59:46.709
after a shooting
at Dan Oil earlier today.

59:46.920 --> 59:51.038
Rasmus Holm Jensen, 46,
is believed -

59:51.240 --> 59:56.951
by Head of Intelligence Adam Larsen
to be the man behind the shootings.

59:57.160 --> 01:00:02.632
The capital is in a state of shock,
and the authorities are on the alert.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:06.469
A trained geophysicist, since 2003
employed with the GDG -

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.638
the Department of Geological Surveys
for Denmark and Greenland.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:14.197
Periodically stationed in Nuuk
specializing in oil deposit studies.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:19.349
For years he's been producing material
for the climate and energy ministry.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:23.235
Three days ago he came back to Denmark.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:27.194
He went to see
his 86-year-old demented father.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.834
Then he approached Mia Moesgaard -

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.715
who for personal or political reasons
covers up for him.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:48.633
I have a little girl waiting for me.
Who'll let her know I'm not coming?

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:54.437
The Indian authorities have suspended
your approval for the time being.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.074
You can't leave Copenhagen.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.158
I know my rights.
I'm going to write about this.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:04.751
You're being detained as a key witness
in the case against Rasmus Holm Jensen.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.872
You can call these two numbers
around the clock.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.719
Goodbye.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:16.514
It seems Rasmus Holm Jensen
for several years -

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.598
has been active on the Internet
under the alias Earth.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.839
Since his youth he's been a member
of rifle clubs, first in Holbæk -

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.191
and then in Copenhagen
where he won almost all tournaments.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.075
He got the ammo and the weapon
through the Copenhagen Rifle Club.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.398
A super subsonic modified Sabatti rifle.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.319
We know all this about him.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:44.038
The problem is he's one step
ahead of us. He could be anywhere.

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:31.792
<i>You've touched down?</i>
- I never left.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.116
<i>I don't believe it!</i>

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:38.438
<i>The flight got cancelled?</i>
- Intelligence took my passport.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.200
<i>I'm at home.</i>

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.392
Meet me at the paper.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.239
<i>We'll work this out.</i>
- Okay.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.030
Mia.

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.953
Hand over your phone.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.794
Go.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:53.678
There's a sleeping bag for you too,
if you get cold.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:02.109
It was an accident.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:10.350
I didn't mean to kill him.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.075
I was on my way
to fetch my little daughter.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.910
I was going to adopt a little girl,
and now someone else will get her.

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.680
Those are the rules.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.916
It's your fault. I covered up for you,
and then you chose to kill a man.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.470
What kind of man are you?

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:09.197
If I can save thousands,
maybe hundreds of thousands -

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:12.437
are my actions wrong?

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.116
Are they immoral?

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:21.474
Or should we keep talking
and covering up for politicians -

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:26.515
and a democracy
that lies to the people?

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:33.156
You shot a man.

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.549
What are we doing here?
What do you want?

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.955
I need your car.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:16.116
I'm going to Germany
at the break of dawn.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.037
There's nothing more for me to do here.

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.154
No.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:37.555
<i>You have called Mia Moesgaard.</i>
<i>Leave a message or text me.</i>

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:42.477
FRIDAY

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.909
What are you doing?

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.156
Don't try to fight me.

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:21.394
You won't get cold,
if you stay here.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.433
For how long?

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.712
The police will find you.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:33.040
Outside the Climate and Energy Ministry
hundreds of protesters are gathered.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:38.553
They're waiting for the
American foreign minister ...

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.076
Thanks.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:54.390
<i>Steffen Husfeldt.</i>
- It's your boss.

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.637
Mia?
<i>- Steffen Husfeldt.</i>

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:02.152
Mia Moesgaard's life is in danger unless
the government calls off the deal.

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.828
Don't touch Mia!
She's got nothing to do with ...

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:10.677
We've got a death threat.
The suspect is targeting the reporter.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:34.554
The police aren't taking any chances
after the shootings in Copenhagen.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.320
They're here in full force -

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:41.752
and I've even seen sharpshooters
posted on the rooftops behind me.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.714
Can we proceed
before we know Mia Moesgaard is safe?

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.754
We very much want to stick
to the security plan we've drawn up.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.633
But it's up to you, Minister.

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:34.078
Let's do it.
- Copy that.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:48.357
Don't be mean!
Let's go green!

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.478
There you go.

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:03.839
Feel the lining.
- I'll take it.

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:08.795
Oh, you have to try the dark suit first.
- Okay then.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.719
I'll find one in your size.

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:28.717
<i>The police.</i>
- I just went jogging in the common.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.549
I noticed a suspicious-looking tent.

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:35.638
<i>Your name, please?</i>
- Conrad Pedersen.

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:39.230
<i>We've localized a tent in the common.</i>

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:46.230
Police!
- I'm alone!

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.628
Are you Mia Moesgaard?

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.434
Yes.
- Kurt Jensen, team leader.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.918
Do you know
where Rasmus Holm Jensen is?

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.589
Heading for the border in my car.

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.671
Any news?
- We've found the shooter's tent.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:22.000
The suspect seems to be on his way
to Germany. We've set up check points.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.077
Moesgaard?
- Safe.

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:28.990
He probably took her hostage
to gain time to flee the country.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:33.193
That's the best news today.
Thanks.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.630
Thanks for driving me home.

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:42.791
<i>The suspect car has been found</i>
<i>carrying stolen license plates.</i>

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.632
<i>Stolen cars will be inspected. The</i>
<i>suspect probably got a new vehicle.</i>

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:40.038
Hi. What are you doing here?
- I live on the top floor.

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:43.073
Your name?
- Kasper Dahl.

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:46.590
Can I check your briefcase?
- Sure.

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:03.436
Fine.
- Thanks.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.869
Thomas, when do you think your fellow
Danes will be ready to hear the news -

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:20.755
that we'll be moving
into Station North?

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:25.636
Well, the Thule base is still
after 50 years a very sensitive subject.

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:28.354
We have to approach this
one step at a time.

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:33.680
I suggest that that first step
be taken as soon as possible.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:41.320
<i>Do a last reconnaissance round.</i>
- Copy that. 703 out.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.910
<i>Calling 703.</i>

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:21.036
<i>Do you copy, 703?</i>

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:25.995
Don't be mean!
Let's go green!

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.108
<i>The motorcade will be</i>
<i>arriving shortly.</i>

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:49.157
<i>703, please respond.</i>
<i>Do you copy, 703?</i>

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:10.831
<i>Calling all units.</i>
<i>The suspect may be in the vicinity.</i>

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:16.679
<i>Calling all units.</i>

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:21.075
<i>The motorcade is arriving in one.</i>

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:30.239
Can I borrow this?

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.919
I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.680
<i>Thomas Borby.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:49.279
Thomas, it's Mia. The shooter is
out to get you. Stay away!

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:54.395
Here comes the motorcade
with the American foreign minister.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:04.550
<i>Calling all units.</i>
<i>The motorcade has arrived.</i>

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:14.036
It is a pleasure working with you.
- The pleasure's all mine.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:20.109
<i>Code red.</i>
<i>Switch to ...</i>

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:32.350
The motorcade just left.

01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.118
So it's now.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.430
Rasmus!

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.749
Don't do it.
Look at me.

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:39.079
Look at me.

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:48.950
No!

01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:54.915
Inside!

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:11.519
2 MONTHS LATER

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:20.918
Mia.
- Thomas.

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:23.554
Take this.

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:31.600
I asked our consul in West Bengal
to get you approved again.

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:39.357
We'll just have to see if he succeeds.

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:44.715
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:49.594
See you.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.349
Felding, any comments?

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:08.998
The oil field in Greenland
contains considerable quantities.

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:12.590
This is a complete surprise to us,
albeit a happy one.

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:16.236
Two or three times the current
oil reserves in the North Sea.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:20.558
New offshore drilling techniques mean
we will be collaborating with the USA -

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:23.991
on many projects
over the next 50 to 70 years.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:27.988
Sources in the defense department say
that Denmark's Station North -

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:31.192
over the next five years
will be expanded to comprise -

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.789
an American strategic military base -

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.949
which will monitor the north eastern
passage through the Arctic Ocean.
