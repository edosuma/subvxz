00:21.440 --> 00:23.639
These are the only three people left.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.940
This is Mr Alex Steele,
Mrs Juliette Ashby,

00:26.040 --> 00:27.479
- Mrs Amy Winehouse.
- Ah, my boobie.

00:27.600 --> 00:28.940
In other words, Mrs Amy Winehouse.

00:29.040 --> 00:32.100
Um, everyone else has gone.
This was my fourteenth...

00:32.200 --> 00:33.319
D'you want a lick of the lollipop?

00:33.440 --> 00:34.399
- Come on, have a lick.
- No, I don't.

00:34.520 --> 00:35.340
- Have a lick.
- No, no, no.

00:35.440 --> 00:36.500
Come here and lick it.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.420
No-one wants, I'm trying to talk.

00:38.520 --> 00:41.100
No-one wants to lick
your slobbery lollipop.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.159
Lick it.

00:44.120 --> 00:48.039
It's my 14th birthday evening and party.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.340
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

00:50.440 --> 00:53.519
<i>- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to you.</i>

00:54.160 --> 00:59.079
<i>Happy birthday dear Lauren</i>

00:59.720 --> 01:02.999
<i>Happy birthday</i>

01:03.120 --> 01:07.439
<i>to you.</i>

01:07.800 --> 01:08.879
Oh, wow!

01:18.920 --> 01:23.540
<i>Moon river, wider than a mile</i>

01:23.640 --> 01:28.820
<i>I'm crossing you in style someday...</i>

01:28.920 --> 01:30.380
I was singing with a little jazz unit,

01:30.480 --> 01:32.479
the National Youth Jazz Orchestra.

01:33.080 --> 01:36.919
I must have been about 16
and I just loved jazz.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.119
Dinah Washington,

01:40.080 --> 01:42.559
Sarah Vaughan, Tony Bennett.

01:43.520 --> 01:48.580
I learnt to sing from listening to stuff
like Monk and a lot of soloists as well

01:48.680 --> 01:50.700
rather than just listening to singers.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.420
I learnt from everything really.

01:52.520 --> 01:56.020
<i>...same rainbow's end</i>

01:56.120 --> 01:58.479
<i>Waiting 'round the bend</i>

01:58.600 --> 02:00.999
<i>My huckleberry friend</i>

02:01.160 --> 02:07.159
<i>Moon river and me.</i>

02:08.199 --> 02:10.119
So singing has always been
important to me

02:10.280 --> 02:13.479
but I never thought I would end
up singing, I'd be a singer.

02:14.120 --> 02:17.420
I just thought I'm lucky that it's something
I can always do if I want to.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.319
I'm so lucky like that.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.679
But I didn't think
it would be a career choice.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.999
<i>...And me</i>

02:27.200 --> 02:30.919
<i>Moon river and me.</i>

02:35.640 --> 02:36.799
What's the date?

02:37.400 --> 02:38.519
- Today?
- 24th.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.540
- Is it?
- Yeah.

02:40.640 --> 02:41.780
- The what?
- 24th.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.919
- Of what?
- January.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.279
- And what day is it?
- Saturday.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.759
And, um, what year is it?

02:50.360 --> 02:52.620
- Lunchtime.
- No, it's lunchtime...

02:52.720 --> 02:55.159
I was a 19 year old office junior

02:55.600 --> 02:58.799
for a promotions
company owned by Simon Fuller.

03:00.040 --> 03:04.279
I just started to try and kind
of blag it myself as a talent scout.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.239
I was definitely out of my depth.

03:09.720 --> 03:12.039
My friend Tyler is a singer.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.519
He was with Nicky Shymansky
and Tyler said,

03:14.640 --> 03:17.199
"My friend Amy sings jazz
and she's great."

03:17.320 --> 03:18.660
And Nicky said to me,

03:18.760 --> 03:21.439
"D'you want some studio time?"
And I said, 'For what?'

03:21.560 --> 03:25.479
He was like, "Well, if you write songs,
we'd make a record, get a record deal."

03:25.880 --> 03:28.759
I was like, "What d'you get out of it?"

03:30.760 --> 03:31.719
Hello.

03:33.320 --> 03:34.519
I look ugly.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.479
Yeah, look at you. You look lovely.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.719
I don't. My chin's massive.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.879
- Worried about your chin?
- That's there forever.

03:45.560 --> 03:50.839
<i>There is no greater thrill</i>

03:54.640 --> 03:59.479
<i>Than what you bring to me</i>

04:04.160 --> 04:07.239
<i>Those sweeter songs</i>

04:08.840 --> 04:11.079
<i>Than what you sing</i>

04:11.760 --> 04:15.879
<i>Sing to me...</i>

04:17.320 --> 04:19.039
Did you decide to record it?

04:19.160 --> 04:24.919
Yeah. Hello.
I'm just here smoking a fag.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.319
I'd just like to... I look so grim.

04:31.720 --> 04:34.980
I look like a floating head,
I've got no hair.

04:35.080 --> 04:39.679
I'm just on a black screen.
There's my hand. What's going on?

04:40.160 --> 04:43.519
We'd recorded quite a few
demo recordings.

04:43.640 --> 04:48.119
I started to talk about whether
she'd ever consider writing.

04:48.440 --> 04:52.340
She said she's not sure about writing
songs but she's written a lot of poems.

04:52.440 --> 04:53.900
<i>...he's my life...</i>

04:54.000 --> 04:56.660
She knew full well
she'd been writing songs

04:56.760 --> 04:58.879
but they were very personal songs.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.340
I wouldn't write anything
unless it was personal to me

05:36.440 --> 05:38.980
just cos I wouldn't be able
to tell the story right

05:39.080 --> 05:40.740
because I wouldn't have done it.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.900
Even though some of it is
personal in a sad way

05:44.000 --> 05:45.540
I'd never let it just be that.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.959
I'll always put a punchline in the song.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.639
Just try and be different
with my lyrics.

05:56.680 --> 05:59.839
Someone gave me a CD, two songs

06:00.320 --> 06:03.100
and they weren't necessarily
what you'd call hit songs

06:03.200 --> 06:06.439
but they conveyed an emotion
that just touched me.

06:08.400 --> 06:13.199
When you have that as an artist,
you usually have a story to tell behind it.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.479
But it was a big leap of faith.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.599
I think my boss even questioned the deal

06:17.720 --> 06:21.340
because we were committing
to giving an unsigned artist

06:21.440 --> 06:23.919
close to a quarter of a million pounds.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.119
We knew that we wanted
to live with each other.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.639
We both knew that we wanted to move out.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.519
She had her family issues.

07:07.720 --> 07:12.220
And I had lots of things going on with my
family and we looked after each other.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.519
It was amazing. We were young kids

07:14.640 --> 07:17.999
and we were best friends
in a flat on our own.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.399
She loved it.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.620
Juliette would sing, Amy would sing

07:26.720 --> 07:29.119
and we just used to see
each other all the time.

07:30.480 --> 07:32.399
We used to go to so many gigs with Amy.

07:33.560 --> 07:36.100
And when she first started
doing her music,

07:36.200 --> 07:38.319
we were all so excited and proud of it.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.220
- Where are we, Amy?
- We're in Brighton.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.140
- But what are we in now?
- A cab.

07:45.240 --> 07:48.620
We're in Regency Square
in a black cab...

07:48.720 --> 07:50.639
- No but, no but...
- In a white beautiful cab.

07:50.800 --> 07:51.879
- And Lauren's with us.
- Ah!

07:54.360 --> 07:56.759
D'you know what my favourite
thing about Nicky is?

07:57.080 --> 07:58.399
His legs.

08:00.520 --> 08:01.559
Ah!

08:02.720 --> 08:04.260
Know what my other favourite thing is...

08:04.360 --> 08:07.239
- What?
- Not your hair.

08:09.240 --> 08:13.279
She could make you feel so important.

08:13.400 --> 08:17.959
And then, all of a sudden,
very unimportant.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.679
And then make you feel
so important again.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.300
That was what she did.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.559
She liked to get people
into a comfortable position

08:25.680 --> 08:27.559
and then shock them.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.460
If I got my hair right,
then what would that mean?

08:30.560 --> 08:33.438
That would mean
you were ready to marry me.

08:49.960 --> 08:53.879
Her first relationship was
with an older guy called Chris.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.479
She really got the hots for him.

08:56.600 --> 08:57.820
Madly in love with him.

08:57.920 --> 09:01.060
She wrote a few songs
about having the hots for him.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.879
And then eventually
she lost interest and...

09:04.360 --> 09:07.639
She used to talk about it and
she started writing about that.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.100
I think when I was growing up,
the music that was

10:27.200 --> 10:32.860
in the pop charts or the music
that people released at the time

10:32.960 --> 10:37.580
I just thought this isn't music, this is
watered down, or you know, just crap.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.580
Someone has written it for you
and you have to sing it.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.700
It's very much the case
with some music today.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.479
So I started writing music
to challenge myself.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.599
To see what I could write or, you know,

10:46.760 --> 10:50.500
just because there was nothing else there
that I could listen to at the time.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.740
And having listened to jazz

10:52.840 --> 10:55.900
and great songwriters like
James Taylor and Carole King.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.540
I felt like I had nothing new
that was coming out at the time

10:59.640 --> 11:01.940
that really represented me
or the way I felt.

11:02.040 --> 11:05.599
So I just started writing
really my own stuff

11:05.720 --> 11:07.399
and from personal experience.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.959
This is "I Heard Love Is Blind."

11:11.440 --> 11:16.439
I'll clip my hair out the way
cos it's getting on my nerves.

11:17.800 --> 11:21.799
I remember thinking when she walked in
she was this complete force of nature

11:21.920 --> 11:23.340
and I thought, "Wow,
there's something about you."

11:23.440 --> 11:25.380
And I remember thinking,
"Please be good."

11:25.480 --> 11:28.719
I wrote this in Miami
with a guy called Salaam

11:28.840 --> 11:33.159
and... I'm really proud of it.

11:33.520 --> 11:38.020
She was 18 and a very classic
North London Jewish girl,

11:38.120 --> 11:39.679
a lot of attitude.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.079
Quite shy.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.719
Something emanated from her.
She had a charisma.

12:09.520 --> 12:13.140
When you looked at her lyrical capability
and her melodic capability

12:13.240 --> 12:16.159
she was a very old soul
in a very young body.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.559
And we did the deal very, very quickly.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.300
Amy's album came out yesterday
and how many has it sold so far?

13:02.400 --> 13:04.620
A pretty staggering
eight hundred, actually.

13:04.720 --> 13:05.599
That is at least.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.780
I've emptied my bank account
buying six hundred of them.

13:07.880 --> 13:10.119
At least half my friends
have bought the album.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.279
Bastards. I'd better call
the other half up today.

13:16.040 --> 13:20.279
Snug in a rug.
She's going to get annoyed.

13:20.960 --> 13:25.380
Amy. Explain what your little
hub is all about.

13:25.480 --> 13:28.359
- Oh, you're coming...
- Sleeping.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.959
Just give us a smile
and then we can turn the camera off.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.700
- I'm in the car now.
- Give us a quick one.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.879
- A one second flash.
- Is picking me up at ten o'clock.

13:48.320 --> 13:51.079
How big d'you think you're going to be?

13:51.200 --> 13:57.039
I don't, at all, because
my music is not on that scale.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.919
Sometimes I wish it was,

14:00.040 --> 14:03.839
but I don't think
I'm gonna be at all famous.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.279
I don't think I could handle it.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.559
I'd probably go mad, I would go mad.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.260
- Where are we going?
- We're going to Birmingham!

14:18.360 --> 14:21.879
- Why are we going there?
- We're going to sing songs.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.999
- Yeah?
- And make merry.

14:26.880 --> 14:30.420
Oh, that was sick! That was sick!

14:30.520 --> 14:33.319
- Get me, get me.
- Nicky that was beautiful.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.519
What are your thoughts
on how beautiful that was?

14:46.600 --> 14:48.599
My turn, my turn.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.159
Let me get a really good shot.
Oh, what a shot.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.639
She don't even care.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.479
Watch it, watch it go in there.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.919
Got no light in here.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.519
Don't get my spots in.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.799
What spots?

15:10.120 --> 15:12.300
- I love you.
- Do you know I'm zooming in then?

15:12.400 --> 15:15.959
You're zooming in on my spots.
You're a fucking cunt.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.719
- Does my hair look okay?
- Yeah, very good.

15:22.600 --> 15:23.700
Looks lovely.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.319
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

15:27.560 --> 15:31.220
- What song should I do first?
- Start off with...

15:31.320 --> 15:34.279
Oh, I love your little cap,
it's so cute.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.260
I think you should start off
with a song called...

15:37.360 --> 15:39.759
Oh, on camera. Okay.

15:40.360 --> 15:43.879
- Go, sister. Go get done.
- Shut up.

16:29.320 --> 16:34.959
<i>In my bed.</i>

16:43.520 --> 16:45.420
Could you please introduce yourself?

16:45.520 --> 16:48.300
Yes. Hello, I'm Amy Winehouse. I'm 20.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.119
I'm a jazz singer.

16:50.240 --> 16:53.700
I've heard your record
and it sounds very mature.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.119
Is it all live?

16:55.240 --> 16:57.620
Also not only the singing
but also the instruments?

16:57.720 --> 17:00.220
Yeah, all the instrumentation
is completely live.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.399
I wouldn't have any fake horns
on my record.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.959
I think they put fake strings
on "Take The Box",

17:06.079 --> 17:07.398
but I wasn't a part of that.

17:07.520 --> 17:12.300
I would never, ever have put
strings on my record, ever.

17:12.400 --> 17:16.159
And this guy doing the mix
of this song, he just...

17:16.440 --> 17:18.519
I didn't even think about it.

17:21.520 --> 17:24.398
Okay. Just a couple of questions.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.079
- Upset?
- Yeah.

17:32.680 --> 17:33.919
Oh, okay.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.799
Okay, okay. Okay.

17:37.960 --> 17:41.599
There wasn't a girl that
had been gobby in the media

17:41.760 --> 17:45.439
for a long time.
And she could be very cutting.

17:45.920 --> 17:49.559
Especially if she got bored
or felt misunderstood.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.140
It seems to me, though,

17:52.240 --> 17:54.540
that every woman who
writes about, you know,

17:54.640 --> 17:56.559
kind of puts it down on a record,

17:56.680 --> 17:59.260
doesn't do them any harm,
really. Look at Dido.

17:59.360 --> 18:04.159
She used that album to clean out
her emotional closet.

18:04.360 --> 18:06.639
- Did she?
- Yeah.

18:06.760 --> 18:09.519
It's all about the break-up
of her relationship

18:09.640 --> 18:11.719
and kind of like surviving.

18:11.840 --> 18:16.239
Like the whole thing about
not going down with the ship.

18:16.360 --> 18:17.479
Yeah.

18:17.600 --> 18:21.940
Dido's Dido, but you know, I mean...

18:24.040 --> 18:26.020
I think she's one of the most
exciting and brilliantly

18:26.120 --> 18:28.820
talented vocalists to emerge
in this country in many years.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.919
It is Amy Winehouse.

18:35.560 --> 18:36.599
Fantastic.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.999
You're managed by the company
who look after S Club 7,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.780
who used to look after
the Spice Girls, Simon Fuller.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.900
Have they tried to mould you any way?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.959
Have they tried to change the
way you look, speak or behave?

18:49.080 --> 18:51.860
One of them tried to mould me
into a big triangle shape

18:51.960 --> 18:53.860
and I went 'No'.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.279
No. You know, I've got my own style.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.919
I've got my own style
and I wrote my own songs.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.799
If someone has so much
of something already,

19:02.920 --> 19:05.300
there's very little you can add.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.220
Yeah. You know what I like
about you as well,

19:07.320 --> 19:10.100
- you sound so common.
- Thanks.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.500
No, because I am common.

19:12.600 --> 19:16.540
It's so refreshing to hear someone
who isn't speaking like

19:16.640 --> 19:18.340
they've taken elocution lessons.

19:18.440 --> 19:19.500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.199
They gave me elocution lessons
but they kind of...

19:22.960 --> 19:25.239
- They didn't stick?
- Off my back, yeah.

19:36.960 --> 19:41.860
I realised early on when Amy
made her mind up, she made her mind up

19:41.960 --> 19:45.399
and I found it difficult
to stand up to her.

19:47.240 --> 19:51.180
She would say: "Oh, Mum,
you're so soft with me.

19:51.280 --> 19:55.239
I can get away with murder.
You should be tougher, Mum."

19:56.360 --> 19:58.479
Well, I just accepted it.

19:59.080 --> 20:02.679
I wasn't strong enough
to say to her "Stop".

20:35.920 --> 20:39.399
I met another woman when
Amy was about 18 months old.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.159
We worked together.
We were having an affair.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.119
But eight or nine years
were to pass before I left home.

20:47.320 --> 20:48.879
I was a coward.

20:50.120 --> 20:53.479
But I felt that Amy
was over it pretty quick.

21:28.840 --> 21:32.580
When Amy was a teenager, 13 and 14
she was being taken to the doctors

21:32.680 --> 21:34.879
and she was on antidepressants.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.940
Amy used to always say
to me that that was her dream

23:54.040 --> 23:56.260
to do those sorts of shows.

23:56.360 --> 23:59.239
To play in jazz clubs
to small audiences.

24:00.320 --> 24:03.639
She had one of the most pure
relationships to music.

24:03.760 --> 24:06.439
Such an emotional relationship to music.

24:06.560 --> 24:09.420
It's like she needed music
as if it was a person

24:09.520 --> 24:11.719
and that she would die for it.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.719
Let me read this.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.799
Oh, my God.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.239
And the winner

24:23.440 --> 24:26.119
and the song is "Stronger Than Man"

24:26.240 --> 24:28.839
by Amy Winehouse and Salaam Remi.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.279
Let's give it up!

24:36.520 --> 24:38.799
This is me, this is me, isn't?
Right here.

24:39.360 --> 24:40.439
Wow.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.919
I don't believe this.

24:43.720 --> 24:47.079
Thank you, Salaam.
There's no picture of him

24:47.240 --> 24:49.759
but Salaam is
the most inspirational producer

24:49.920 --> 24:51.559
I've ever worked with.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.679
He has that unique skill
of not just having

24:53.800 --> 24:57.500
the most appropriate beat,

24:57.600 --> 24:59.919
but also drawing the artistry out.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.420
And I guess
that's the story of this song...

25:02.520 --> 25:06.079
What I allowed her to do
was to put her wit into her songs.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.559
When I heard her sing in front of me,

25:08.760 --> 25:11.319
I could tell she was really
like a jazz singer.

25:11.440 --> 25:14.319
She had the stylings
of a 65 year old jazz singer

25:14.440 --> 25:16.439
who knew the ropes up and down.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.420
It was like, "Okay, if this is
what you are when you're 18

25:19.520 --> 25:21.599
then what are you gonna be
when you're 25?"

25:34.000 --> 25:36.100
We're now joined
by Mos Def in the backstage area.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.140
Thanks for coming and taking
time out and chatting to us.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.919
I heard they was doing
something so I came down.

25:42.640 --> 25:46.660
I became aware of Amy in 2004.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.519
I was out in England.

25:50.320 --> 25:53.279
I'm a big jazz fan and I really
liked what she was doing.

25:53.800 --> 25:54.759
I thought it was unique.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.940
I thought it was edgy and sincere

25:57.040 --> 25:59.260
and that's the thing
I liked most about Amy is that

25:59.360 --> 26:02.540
she didn't have any airs. She was real.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.700
I had a chance to meet her
while I was here

26:11.800 --> 26:14.039
and we hit it off.
We became fast friends.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.799
She was just a charming, sweet lady.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.159
I had a bit of a crush on her,
to be honest.

26:20.840 --> 26:23.740
She was raw, she was fast
with a blue joke.

26:23.840 --> 26:26.119
Could drink anybody under the table.

26:26.320 --> 26:30.159
Wasn't afraid to roll a smoke.
Had a big giant laugh.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.999
And was just a sweetheart, you know.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.919
You don't seem
that bothered about everything.

26:53.080 --> 26:57.039
Some artists step in here and go,
"I want that number one spot.

26:57.160 --> 26:58.380
- I want my album to go number one.
- Yeah.

26:58.480 --> 26:59.940
- I wanna chase up with a second album.
- Yeah.

27:00.040 --> 27:02.500
- What's up with you?
- I'm determined on the next thing.

27:02.600 --> 27:04.620
I'm not interested in...

27:04.720 --> 27:08.359
Success to me is not success
to the record company or whoever.

27:08.680 --> 27:11.340
Success to me is having
the freedom to work

27:11.440 --> 27:13.159
- with whoever I wanna work.
- Yeah.

27:13.280 --> 27:16.740
To always be able
to just fuck everything off

27:16.840 --> 27:18.999
and go to the studio
when I have to go to the studio.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.220
- Or...
- But you can't do that.

27:21.320 --> 27:23.060
You have other responsibilities now.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.079
- You're becoming an artist in the public eye.
- Yeah.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.719
So all of a sudden you're gonna be...

27:26.920 --> 27:28.919
I'm not saying you're gonna be
hounded by the press,

27:29.080 --> 27:30.639
but you're gonna have
certain responsibilities

27:30.760 --> 27:32.959
that you may not particularly welcome.

27:33.120 --> 27:36.679
That's cool but I think
the more people see of me,

27:36.800 --> 27:39.759
the more they'll realise that
all I'm good for is making tunes.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.700
So leave me alone and I'll do it.

27:41.800 --> 27:46.279
I will do the music.
I need time to do the music.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.940
When she went to Camden
it was very exciting

28:21.040 --> 28:24.780
cos it was her first property that she'd
bought and we were all really happy.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.959
She loved Camden. She loved it up there.

28:29.200 --> 28:32.959
But when she went to Camden,
things started changing.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.959
We were the Indi kids.

28:56.920 --> 28:59.239
Gazelles, The Rakes, Babyshambles.

28:59.360 --> 29:02.039
Every one was a Camden band.
Like, it was cool again.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.879
In them days it was
very much like, basically

29:06.280 --> 29:10.079
if you were in a signed
band you were a cunt

29:10.840 --> 29:13.860
because the best looking
and the best dressed

29:13.960 --> 29:17.479
and the coolest people were the ones
who were born to lose really.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.799
The Libertines, yeah? I slept on them.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.519
I came to the Libertines
like a year later than everyone else.

29:24.880 --> 29:28.220
But, I'm not being funny,
they made people proud to be British.

29:28.320 --> 29:31.039
That was London
for a real spell, you know.

29:33.640 --> 29:36.799
I run a club called Trash
with my friend Errol.

29:37.280 --> 29:38.719
Did the door there.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.420
Blake would give out flyers for Trash.

29:40.520 --> 29:41.580
We wouldn't have met each other

29:41.680 --> 29:43.119
and a lot of people wouldn't
have all known each other

29:43.240 --> 29:44.559
- had it not been for Trash.
- Yeah.

29:44.680 --> 29:46.119
- That's fair enough, innit?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:46.280 --> 29:49.079
It's the first place
I learnt how to pull a bird.

29:49.360 --> 29:51.199
He just loved girls, you know.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.879
He loved partying and he loved shagging.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.879
Always in and out of bed.

29:56.760 --> 29:59.719
We met in a pub
in "The Good Mixer" in Camden.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.599
I was at the bar and then she came in.

30:02.720 --> 30:06.660
We just sort of started playing
pool, then we went to another pub.

30:06.760 --> 30:08.919
And then we went back to Amy's house.

30:09.040 --> 30:12.319
She was seeing somebody else
and I was seeing somebody else

30:12.480 --> 30:15.199
but I didn't think of it as infidelity.

30:15.360 --> 30:17.100
I just thought she was like a young girl

30:17.200 --> 30:19.879
and she was a bit naughty.
And I was the same.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.759
- Are you alright?
- How you doing? You okay?

30:42.160 --> 30:43.599
What's going on with you at the moment?

30:43.720 --> 30:45.220
Cos obviously "Frank" was last year

30:45.320 --> 30:47.719
and we haven't really heard
much from you since then.

30:47.840 --> 30:48.999
So when are we gonna hear from you next?

30:49.160 --> 30:51.860
- What's the next single?
- I can't think of the next single.

30:51.960 --> 30:55.580
I'm just gonna write
the next album at the minute.

30:55.680 --> 30:59.239
- You having writer's block or...
- Yeah, man. It's hard to write

30:59.360 --> 31:01.540
because you can write
a million things a day

31:01.640 --> 31:04.039
but it's hard to write
something that you're proud of.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.079
So I'm just trying, you know.

31:09.800 --> 31:11.239
I asked to see her.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.759
She was late and she came in with Nicky.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.719
She was a character.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.719
She called me Uncle Lucian,
and I really liked her.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.780
And I had enough
of a relationship with her

31:21.880 --> 31:24.039
so there's no flattery.
It was like blunt.

31:24.200 --> 31:26.020
And I said:
"Enough, I need another album.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.639
Now go and write one.
This is horse shit.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.839
"Frank" was then, this is now.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.799
They're all gonna forget you."

31:35.080 --> 31:36.879
She didn't like it.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.679
- Nick Shymansky.
- Yes.

31:42.040 --> 31:43.519
Sit up a bit.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.359
- Yes?
- How are you today, darling?

31:47.560 --> 31:49.660
Very good, actually. Thanks.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.959
- What about you?
- Really good.

31:52.440 --> 31:53.940
In between all this,

31:54.040 --> 31:58.479
she decided she wanted me to leave 19

31:58.680 --> 32:00.519
with Simon Fuller to go and manage her.

32:02.040 --> 32:06.919
She didn't like being connected
with Pop Idol and the Spice Girls

32:07.040 --> 32:09.500
but I thought
it would be incredibly disloyal,

32:09.600 --> 32:11.919
at this point, to walk away.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.860
And Blake was very quickly becoming

32:17.960 --> 32:20.100
bigger and bigger character in all this.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.479
She was with him the whole time

32:22.600 --> 32:25.559
and didn't want
to go places without him.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.999
We spent the summer together.

32:30.760 --> 32:34.719
She used to say we were like twins
and that was our relationship.

32:34.880 --> 32:39.479
I'd like to sabotage myself and I think
Amy would like to sabotage herself.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.919
Maybe that was our nature.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.879
I used to ask her
why was she promiscuous

32:47.000 --> 32:49.479
and why she was
more like a man with sex.

32:49.600 --> 32:53.239
It's indicative of somebody
that's had a traumatic event,

32:53.400 --> 32:55.239
maybe sexually, themselves.

32:55.360 --> 32:58.119
Sort of made sense to me
from the way she was.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.820
She'd just say, "It's nothing.

33:00.920 --> 33:04.159
I weren't abused when I was a kid.
Nothing like that."

33:04.280 --> 33:09.740
And she said her dad leaving her mum
was what caused this

33:09.840 --> 33:12.039
and her not really seeing her dad.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.479
I understood.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.140
I cut my wrists
when I was nine years old.

33:19.240 --> 33:22.140
I don't know if I wanted
to necessarily die,

33:22.240 --> 33:25.279
I just wanted my mum
to leave my stepdad.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.199
Me and Amy were quite similar.

33:30.960 --> 33:34.799
I fell in love with someone
who I would have died for.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.759
We were in love and we were together.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.639
And that's like a real drug, isn't it?

34:02.240 --> 34:05.599
<i>If my man was fighting</i>

34:05.880 --> 34:08.679
<i>some unholy war</i>

34:08.960 --> 34:11.478
<i>I would be behind him</i>

34:11.639 --> 34:14.518
<i>Straight shook up beside him</i>

34:15.040 --> 34:17.799
<i>With strength he didn't know</i>

34:17.920 --> 34:20.958
<i>It's you I'm fighting for</i>

34:22.239 --> 34:27.319
<i>He can't lose with me in tow</i>

34:27.520 --> 34:30.780
<i>With me in tow.</i>

34:30.880 --> 34:36.438
<i>I refuse to let him go</i>

34:37.679 --> 34:40.179
<i>To let him go.</i>

34:40.280 --> 34:43.438
<i>At his side</i>

34:44.000 --> 34:48.399
<i>and drunk on pride</i>

34:49.199 --> 34:54.958
<i>We wait for the blow.</i>

35:12.640 --> 35:16.159
Oh, let's see who's gonna
be behind the green door.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.060
Master of the house is not in right now.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.639
She is gone somewhere
for a minute to be somewhere.

35:21.760 --> 35:22.980
She's having dinner

35:23.080 --> 35:25.380
so I'm having a cheeky
cigarette while she gone.

35:25.480 --> 35:26.820
Don't tell her. Shh. Don't tell her.

35:26.920 --> 35:31.340
Cheeky. "Mi scusi".
Tell me about this place.

35:31.440 --> 35:34.220
While she's away, I'll give you
a tour of the house.

35:34.320 --> 35:35.940
Okay, ready? Okay.

35:36.040 --> 35:38.540
First of all I lead you
into the main room.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.820
This is usually reserved
for entertaining guests

35:40.920 --> 35:43.519
but you can be my guest,
because no-one's here today.

35:43.640 --> 35:46.239
Okay, I lead you out to the grand patio.

35:46.520 --> 35:49.399
Please, please follow.
Don't mind me in my...

35:50.240 --> 35:52.839
Okay, darling. This is the grand patio.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.479
This is Cecil.

35:55.040 --> 35:56.479
Cecil lives here.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.119
Cecil.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.540
Then we have the bedroom.
It's very nice.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.239
There are some cupboards.

36:02.360 --> 36:06.159
See up here, this is where I
sleep when the master come home.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.300
The toilet.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.839
Sometimes when I'm alone,
I have a shower in all my clothes.

36:11.960 --> 36:14.460
I find this is the only true
way to relax.

36:14.560 --> 36:18.380
Also here, this is the hook
I hang from when I'm in trouble.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.399
It's not very often, I'm a good boy.

36:20.600 --> 36:23.340
I'm a good boy. Okay, well this is it.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.119
Welcome to my humble abode.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.319
Amy.

36:30.840 --> 36:34.199
We are sitting in a little bar

36:34.320 --> 36:37.279
drinking cocktails. There's my cocktail.

36:38.240 --> 36:40.479
There's Amy's little cocktail.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.439
I think it's got Rohypnol in it.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.340
All of a sudden she went to me:

36:57.440 --> 37:01.879
"Lauren, listen to this message.
This is a message from Blake."

37:04.240 --> 37:06.879
I said to her that I didn't
wanna leave my girlfriend

37:07.800 --> 37:09.919
and we'd probably be better as friends.

37:13.760 --> 37:16.719
She was obsessing
over these text messages.

37:16.920 --> 37:20.399
He wanted nothing to do with her
and she was obsessing over it.

37:21.360 --> 37:25.199
All she wanted was
for him to wanna see her.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.039
It got messy.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.759
He went back to his girlfriend,
then she got her own back.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.799
She slept with his friend.

38:17.400 --> 38:19.039
The person that lived
opposite in the little court

38:19.160 --> 38:22.100
had Juliette's number and
had called Juliette up to say:

38:22.200 --> 38:24.540
"Amy's fallen over
and she's hurt her head."

38:24.640 --> 38:26.140
So we've gone round there.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.940
It looked like people had
been squatting in her house.

38:29.040 --> 38:32.660
It stank, it was dirty.
And she was lying on the bed,

38:32.760 --> 38:35.679
and she had this golf ball
coming out of her head.

38:35.840 --> 38:38.839
So we worked till like three
in the morning and cleaned the house.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.999
And I called her dad,
and we called Nick.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.999
We all met there and it was like,

39:04.160 --> 39:07.999
"This is getting out of control."
"We need to get her some help."

39:08.960 --> 39:14.039
I've tried speaking to the parents
and they really wanna kinda take it on.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.519
And so I, technically,
I sort of kidnapped her.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.980
I picked her up and I thought,

39:30.080 --> 39:32.100
"I'm driving you
to the middle of nowhere

39:32.200 --> 39:36.319
and we're gonna sit there until
you acknowledge what's going on."

39:37.080 --> 39:40.439
I drove her to Black Park in Iver.

39:43.520 --> 39:46.220
And it started off with her
sort of laughing,

39:46.320 --> 39:48.159
"you're such an idiot."

39:48.600 --> 39:50.919
And then it turned into
"Don't be a prick."

39:51.040 --> 39:52.959
She kicked my car.

39:54.080 --> 39:56.780
And then she just broke down eventually.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.420
Opened up about everything.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.900
She said she thinks she's got a problem,

40:01.000 --> 40:05.239
she was lost and out of her depth.
Horrible.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.039
She agreed to go to rehab.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.919
I took her to see the rehab guy.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.799
She was like,
"I don't wanna talk about it.

40:14.920 --> 40:17.039
I'll go if my dad thinks I should go."

40:18.400 --> 40:21.559
We'd spoken to Mitch. We'd set it all up

40:22.240 --> 40:24.919
and she turned into
a seven year old child.

40:25.120 --> 40:28.279
Sat on her father's lap
and put her arm round him.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.199
I said to the managers,

40:32.320 --> 40:34.799
"She doesn't need
to go to rehab, she's fine."

40:35.960 --> 40:38.220
My dad said "you're alright,
you don't need to go."

40:38.320 --> 40:41.999
I said, "Alright, Dad, I'll go and meet him
and then we'll back out", which I did.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.879
She didn't need to go to rehab.

40:47.160 --> 40:51.999
That was the moment we lost
a very key opportunity.

40:52.240 --> 40:53.780
I'm not saying it would have worked.

40:53.880 --> 40:56.220
Very often you have to go
two or three times

40:56.320 --> 41:00.319
but she wasn't a star.
She wasn't swarmed by paparazzi.

41:00.440 --> 41:03.100
We could've just fucked
"Back To Black" off,

41:03.200 --> 41:05.020
and "Back To Black"
might have never happened

41:05.120 --> 41:07.740
but she'd have had a chance
to have been dealt with

41:07.840 --> 41:13.119
by professionals before
the world wanted a piece of her.

42:13.480 --> 42:18.359
<i>I never wanted you to be my man</i>

42:19.440 --> 42:24.239
<i>I just wanted to see
what you can do. Yeah.</i>

42:24.800 --> 42:28.639
<i>No. Yo, yeah.</i>

42:29.320 --> 42:32.119
The label were considering
letting her go.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.959
She ends up coming back to Miami.

42:35.280 --> 42:37.580
Guy Moot calls me up, like "Hey,
are you sure you wanna do this?"

42:37.680 --> 42:40.380
And I said, "Listen,
even if you dropped her,

42:40.480 --> 42:44.500
I would pay her to come to my house
and sing cos this shit fucking moves me."

42:44.600 --> 42:49.119
<i>Many times when I tried
to set you right</i>

42:50.360 --> 42:52.860
<i>It's just too hard</i>

42:52.960 --> 42:56.559
<i>I never wanted you</i>

42:56.680 --> 43:00.700
<i>to be my man but I really...</i>

43:00.800 --> 43:03.679
And she totally didn't drink
the whole time while she was here.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.180
And she sat out
in my back garden for four days.

43:09.280 --> 43:12.159
She'd just take her little
notebook and just keep writing.

43:22.600 --> 43:26.220
<i>All I can ever be to you
is the darkness that we knew</i>

43:26.320 --> 43:29.599
<i>And this regret I got accustomed to</i>

43:30.480 --> 43:34.119
<i>Once it was so right
When we were at our height</i>

43:34.400 --> 43:37.279
<i>Waiting for you in the hotel at night</i>

43:37.960 --> 43:39.799
<i>I knew I hadn't met my match</i>

43:39.960 --> 43:41.919
<i>With every moment we could snatch</i>

43:42.080 --> 43:45.279
<i>I don't know why I got so attached.</i>

44:10.120 --> 44:13.679
It took me a while
to get my head round a lot of things.

44:14.440 --> 44:15.999
The actual turning point
when I was alright with it was

44:16.360 --> 44:18.079
when I started writing the album.

44:18.200 --> 44:20.599
I write songs because
I'm fucked up in the head

44:20.760 --> 44:21.940
and I need to put it on paper

44:22.040 --> 44:24.140
and then write a song to it
and to feel better about it.

44:24.240 --> 44:25.580
Have something good
out of something bad.

44:25.680 --> 44:27.119
<i>He walks away</i>

44:28.000 --> 44:31.500
<i>The sun goes down, he takes the day</i>

44:31.600 --> 44:34.599
<i>But I'm grown, and in your way</i>

44:34.880 --> 44:40.159
<i>My deep shade, my tears dry.</i>

44:50.840 --> 44:54.679
The ideas were there.
Four or five songs were there.

44:55.160 --> 44:58.799
You can feel something
creatively starting to happen.

45:00.160 --> 45:03.020
But I was still very worried
about her health.

45:03.120 --> 45:06.199
She's really vulnerable
and not in a good place.

45:09.280 --> 45:13.759
And then she said, "Listen,
are you leaving 19 to manage me?"

45:13.880 --> 45:15.580
And I said, "D'you know what,

45:15.680 --> 45:17.700
unless you let me help you
sort yourself out

45:17.800 --> 45:19.519
I'm not doing this shit for you.

45:19.640 --> 45:22.399
I can't watch you
do yourself in like this."

45:24.880 --> 45:28.180
I remember she came to talk about
wanting to change management.

45:28.280 --> 45:30.260
I said, "Look, that's entirely
your decision.

45:30.360 --> 45:32.959
We will support you whatever
you wanna do."

45:33.920 --> 45:36.220
And then she said she wanted
to be managed by Raye Cosbert.

45:36.320 --> 45:39.759
All I thought is, "Why are you gonna
be managed by your promoter?"

45:40.160 --> 45:43.820
I remember thinking "We'll deal
with a promoter whose main interest

45:43.920 --> 45:45.660
will be to get her out on the road."

45:45.760 --> 45:48.159
And we knew she was
very vulnerable on the road.

45:52.480 --> 45:55.039
When I first met Amy,
I was her concert promoter.

45:56.120 --> 45:59.260
We talked and she said
that her contract was up with 19

45:59.360 --> 46:01.879
and she wanted to explore
other possibilities.

46:02.040 --> 46:03.500
She said, "Would you like to do it?"

46:03.600 --> 46:06.079
And I was like, "Well, yeah,
let's talk about it."

46:07.160 --> 46:08.700
We got on quite well.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.039
I'd be the guy that'd turn up
after the gig

46:10.240 --> 46:13.740
and say "Well done". Have a glass
of bubbly and I thought, well,

46:13.840 --> 46:15.580
sometimes someone just wants a change

46:15.680 --> 46:18.180
because they feel
it's right for them to change.

46:18.280 --> 46:20.279
It's like switching bank accounts.

46:31.440 --> 46:32.959
I was way too close to Amy.

46:33.080 --> 46:34.679
I shouldn't have ever been that close.

46:34.800 --> 46:36.519
It should have been business.

46:37.120 --> 46:39.879
But when you're 19
and you meet a 16 year old

46:40.000 --> 46:43.319
and you go through that
you don't understand that.

46:55.360 --> 46:58.399
We'd spent all these years together

46:59.760 --> 47:03.679
and all of a sudden,
out of nowhere, I wasn't there.

47:14.640 --> 47:16.439
Let's get this taped.

47:16.560 --> 47:17.820
And you'll keep that one.

47:17.920 --> 47:20.199
When I started writing
the first song about Blake

47:20.320 --> 47:22.319
the other songs just wrote themselves.

47:22.520 --> 47:25.599
I really was on a roll
because I had these feelings,

47:25.760 --> 47:27.679
had these words floating around in me.

47:27.800 --> 47:29.799
When you write a song,
you have to remember how you felt.

47:29.920 --> 47:31.220
You have to remember
what the weather was like.

47:31.320 --> 47:33.340
You have to remember
what his neck smelt like.

47:33.440 --> 47:35.439
You have to remember all of it.

47:42.080 --> 47:43.999
She would tell me stories about Blake

47:44.120 --> 47:48.319
and this tempestuous,
extreme relationship.

47:48.600 --> 47:51.100
That first day she wrote "Back To Black"

47:51.200 --> 47:54.359
all the lyrics and the melody
in two or three hours.

49:16.760 --> 49:19.659
<i>Black</i>

49:21.126 --> 49:24.377
<i>Black</i>

49:25.360 --> 49:27.999
<i>Black.</i>

49:29.440 --> 49:32.479
Oh, it's a bit upsetting
at the end, isn't it?

49:32.600 --> 49:36.119
- Rrrr, boom, boom, boom.
- I love that. Yes, Amy.

49:36.800 --> 49:37.959
Yeah!

49:41.040 --> 49:43.119
It was just one
of those serendipitous things.

49:43.240 --> 49:45.660
Like I just caught her
at that magic moment.

49:45.760 --> 49:47.839
And she was just ready to get it going.

49:47.960 --> 49:50.220
That's why I couldn't understand
what everyone else was saying

49:50.320 --> 49:54.279
about this procrastinating,
troubled artist.

49:57.560 --> 50:01.119
I went out to New York to hear
what they were doing.

50:01.600 --> 50:04.860
When I was flying out I got
a call from management saying

50:04.960 --> 50:07.620
that Amy's nan had fallen ill

50:07.720 --> 50:11.639
and she wanted
to get straight back to her nan.

50:39.800 --> 50:42.399
Cynthia used to look after Amy.

50:43.040 --> 50:46.999
She was like the mother
that I didn't have.

50:48.120 --> 50:52.359
My own mother was not
really motherly to me.

50:54.160 --> 50:58.679
So, Amy and Cynthia
were very very close.

51:01.680 --> 51:04.340
My mum died May the 5th, 2006.

51:04.440 --> 51:06.279
She had lung cancer.

51:09.640 --> 51:12.300
Cynthia was a strong person in her life

51:12.400 --> 51:16.359
and used to tell her how it is.
So it was horrible for her.

51:17.920 --> 51:20.199
That killed her inside.

51:27.520 --> 51:29.900
Hang on, I'm not playing this track now.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.919
Not playing this track now.

51:32.400 --> 51:34.780
I'm not playing this track now.

51:34.880 --> 51:37.860
I spoke to them and they said
it's just unnecessary.

51:37.960 --> 51:40.639
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

51:41.240 --> 51:43.340
We were making
the back end of the record

51:43.440 --> 51:47.279
and we were at Metropolis Studios
and Amy had bits of vocal to finish.

51:48.920 --> 51:51.519
Have I got any drink?
Did they bring up that drink?

51:52.440 --> 51:55.220
- It's quite fun really.
- An acoustic session.

51:55.320 --> 51:58.039
I haven't been filmed like this.
I haven't done it before.

51:59.440 --> 52:02.319
She was having a couple
of whisky and cokes.

52:02.440 --> 52:04.460
We had broke for lunch.

52:04.560 --> 52:07.420
Amy had ordered
this massive plate of food

52:07.520 --> 52:10.039
and she had a big dessert as well.

52:10.400 --> 52:15.020
She finished the whole thing off
and she disappeared for a while

52:15.120 --> 52:18.879
and 45 minutes later came back,
a bit kind of dazed.

52:23.160 --> 52:26.820
And the studio manager pulled
me out of the session and said,

52:26.920 --> 52:29.439
"Look, I need you to come
and see something."

52:29.600 --> 52:33.940
She took me to the women's toilets
and Amy had thrown everything up

52:34.040 --> 52:36.719
and literally redecorated the toilets.

52:37.120 --> 52:39.380
She'd obviously been wiping her face

52:39.480 --> 52:43.039
and all the mascara had been
rubbed off on the towels.

52:43.520 --> 52:47.959
And that's when I kinda realised
that something serious was wrong.

52:50.920 --> 52:53.919
I had a toffee fudge. But I ate it.

52:55.640 --> 52:56.679
Yummy.

52:56.880 --> 52:59.679
When she was probably 15.

53:00.440 --> 53:03.599
She one day said, 'I've got
this really great diet, Mum.

53:04.240 --> 53:08.319
I eat what I want
and then I just bring it all up'.

53:09.560 --> 53:11.079
I know I'm a pig.

53:12.240 --> 53:15.039
I know I'm a pig, I just can't help it.

53:15.760 --> 53:18.879
I obviously did not think
that deeply of it.

53:19.040 --> 53:21.719
My feeling was it would pass.

53:23.160 --> 53:25.599
And then she told Mitchell about it.

53:26.360 --> 53:31.519
He also sort of pushed it aside
not taking it seriously.

53:33.240 --> 53:38.919
That basically is bulimia
and it doesn't pass.

53:43.360 --> 53:45.740
- Hello. Welcome to the show.
- Hello, you alright?

53:45.840 --> 53:47.660
You've been away for a while.
What have you been up to?

53:47.760 --> 53:49.479
I've done an album,
it's called "Back To Black".

53:49.600 --> 53:53.679
- How would you describe it?
- It's a lot more...

53:54.400 --> 53:58.020
I don't wanna say more raw but it's not
got all the clever like jazz chords.

53:58.120 --> 53:59.340
It's not really like that now.

53:59.440 --> 54:02.079
I've listened to a lot of
girl groups and garage bands.

54:02.240 --> 54:03.780
It's kinda what it's like.
It's a lot more guitar.

54:03.880 --> 54:06.839
I mean I'm a guitarist, I've been
listening to a lot more guitar bands.

54:06.960 --> 54:09.060
I mean in Camden,
you can't really get away from it so...

54:09.160 --> 54:10.719
- You can't.
- It's rubbed off on me.

54:11.200 --> 54:14.719
Would you say it's more accessible
than your debut?

54:14.840 --> 54:16.639
I'd say it's more,
I'd say it was more accessible.

54:16.760 --> 54:20.580
It's not necessarily more poppy
but jazz is quite an exclusive.

54:20.680 --> 54:25.679
It's quite an elitist music.
This album's a lot less like that.

54:54.440 --> 54:58.399
<i>I'd rather be at home with friends.</i>

55:00.960 --> 55:03.180
Let's talk about your music then.

55:03.280 --> 55:08.559
"Rehab" has gone down so well.
Are you surprised by the reaction?

55:08.720 --> 55:10.100
I am actually.

55:10.200 --> 55:12.679
I never even thought
it'd be a single really.

55:12.800 --> 55:14.039
But the record company were just like,

55:14.200 --> 55:15.820
"We want it to be a single",
and I was like 'Okay'.

55:15.920 --> 55:18.439
I love all of it.
I'm really proud of it.

55:19.480 --> 55:21.399
The Q Awards,
which you were at yesterday.

55:21.520 --> 55:22.540
Did you have a good time?

55:22.640 --> 55:24.079
I had too good a time, to be honest.

55:24.600 --> 55:26.239
If that's possible.

55:27.080 --> 55:28.799
Alcohol is bad, kids.

55:30.040 --> 55:32.839
<i>...in a shot glass</i>

55:32.960 --> 55:35.239
<i>They tried to make me go to rehab</i>

55:35.360 --> 55:38.199
<i>I said, no, no, no...</i>

55:45.320 --> 55:47.340
Can you tie that any tighter?
What are you doing?

55:47.440 --> 55:48.380
You have to be able to sing.

55:48.480 --> 55:50.399
How can you breathe when you're singing?

55:50.520 --> 55:53.992
- That's tight.
- Breathe? Sing? What?

55:55.480 --> 56:01.279
There was this atmosphere
of celebrity all tied into "Rehab".

56:02.200 --> 56:04.239
"Rehab" was the pivotal song.

56:04.400 --> 56:07.679
It was the song that gets her
into a particular place.

56:08.160 --> 56:10.159
Her becoming a commercial star.

56:11.920 --> 56:15.199
The winner of the Best
British Female this year

56:16.240 --> 56:18.540
way more rock and roll
than Liam Gallagher,

56:18.640 --> 56:21.519
it's the one, the only... Amy Winehouse!

57:17.880 --> 57:18.900
Amy.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.079
Amy!

57:22.400 --> 57:24.799
Okay, let's just go.
Get the, get the, go.

57:26.320 --> 57:27.839
Let's go, man!

58:41.480 --> 58:46.777
<i>We're, we're still friends</i>

58:48.923 --> 58:53.424
<i>We're still friends</i>

58:54.040 --> 58:58.559
<i>We're still friends.</i>

59:19.520 --> 59:22.159
Rach, this is Blake, he's my fiancÃ©.

59:22.280 --> 59:23.239
- Hi.
- Hello.

59:38.120 --> 59:39.439
Turn the volume up.

59:39.560 --> 59:42.439
We're kicking off for one
hundred and seven days of summer

59:42.560 --> 59:45.999
on 107.5 WBLS.

59:47.840 --> 59:52.159
<i>The man said,
Why do you think you're here?</i>

59:54.320 --> 59:57.039
<i>I said, I got no...</i>

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:05.359
<i>I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby</i>

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:13.639
<i>So I always keep a bottle near</i>

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.239
<i>He said,
I just think you're depressed,</i>

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:26.780
<i>Kiss me, yeah baby, and go rest.</i>

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.719
I love not like,

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.540
Amy Winehouse because her voice is
the most original voice

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.359
I've heard in the last ten years.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.159
My daughter has turned
everybody on to it.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.159
And I've turned all my friends on to it.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.119
Her CD is entitled "Back To Black".
Please welcome Amy Winehouse.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.319
<i>I just...</i>

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.119
<i>Oh, I just need a friend</i>

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:58.159
<i>See I'm not gonna spare ten weeks</i>

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:02.319
<i>Have everyone think I'm</i>

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:07.180
<i>on the mend</i>

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.399
<i>It's not just my pride</i>

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:18.439
<i>It's just till these tears have dried</i>

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.460
<i>Tried to make me go to rehab...</i>

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.719
Amy called me.
And then I saw her in New York.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.300
She wasn't puffed up
about herself at all.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.319
She was almost embarrassed by
the fact that she was doing so well.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:34.380
She expressed a lot of concern
and fear about the way things

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.439
were gonna go and how she was
gonna handle it, you know.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.799
She was like, "What am I supposed
to do in this space?"

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.599
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.759
Amy Winehouse. Nice job.
Thank you very much.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.359
Amy!

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.559
Everybody just wanted
to spend time with Amy.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:06.039
In our business there's nothing
that can prepare you

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.359
for that level of success.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.919
There's no textbook.
You can warn an artist,

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.599
you can try and prepare them for it

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.100
but at the end of the day,
until you go through it

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.799
it's unlike anything
you've ever encountered.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.159
By yourself, by yourself.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.919
By yourself!

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.940
How do you think
the shoot's going, baby?

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.660
Really well, baby.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.119
- Enjoying yourself?
- Yeah.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:57.580
What's it like to be shot
by Terry Richardson?

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.519
What's he like at shooting?

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.460
It's a lifelong dream come true.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.039
What d'you think about the broken glass?

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.599
I wrote "I love Blake on my tummy."

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.799
Did you? Did you outline it?

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.839
No, I wrote "I love Blake" on my tummy.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.679
I can't see any scars.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.119
It's just chicken scratch.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.680
Have you seen how good I am?

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.679
So what's been
your highlight of the day?

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.820
- It'll be in five minutes...
- When...?

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.679
We go in the toilet and I fucking...

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.479
Blake, sit here.

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.479
Yes, Terry sir.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.759
Amy, sit there.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:01.159
That's good, that's lovely.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.879
You've been famous in
the UK for a little while longer.

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:14.599
Does it seem different
how you're treated here in a way

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.479
compared to the way
that people write about you,

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.740
it's almost like a 23 year old's never
wanted to go and have fun before.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.959
It's you know, it's kind
of hypocritical in a way.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.119
I wouldn't know. I really wouldn't know.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.079
You have known each other a long time?

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.799
You've known each other.
You grew up together?

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.799
You were fighting to get her back?

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:29.839
And what happened?

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.319
Always plays up to it.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.599
The day we got married,
we went out on a boat round Miami.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.100
Smoked a cigar
and it was like a real achievement,

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.439
an amazing thing
that me and her had actually done.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.439
We'd actually gone and got married.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.319
And we did it exactly how we wanted to.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.999
You lazy people.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.239
Wave.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:16.140
Her whole thing was
she wanted to feel how he felt.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.519
And she was like, "I just
wanna feel what he's feeling.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.439
I wanna be on the same level
otherwise he's there and I'm here."

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.399
That's what she wanted,
that was the goal.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.719
Welcome back to 45th and 9th.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:46.279
Please give a warm, warm round
of applause for Amy Winehouse.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:44.639
<i>Yeah I cheated myself</i>

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:49.079
<i>Like I knew I knew I would</i>

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.500
<i>I told you</i>

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.540
<i>I was trouble</i>

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:59.359
<i>Yeah you know that I'm no good.</i>

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.479
Thank you very much.

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:17.580
Have they? Bollocks.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.439
Have they? Fuck.
I heard about that as well.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:25.839
Amy... go and talk in the kitchen.

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:30.799
I dunno.

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:33.999
Yeah, I dunno.

01:08:42.359 --> 01:08:44.919
After we came back from America, married

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.279
that was the first time Amy
tried crack cocaine and heroin.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.819
I'd used by then and enjoyed it.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:55.599
It completely eradicates
any sort of negative feelings.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.759
And then Amy tried it with me.

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:02.879
Then it just got a grip of both of us
really quickly from then.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.719
- Amy.
- Yeah.

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.238
Come in here.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.439
Coming.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.959
Oh, change the record. Just come on.

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.839
Pass me a little...

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.639
Come on, Amy!

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.799
Guys, will you stand back
from the car there, please.

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.079
Are you alright keeping the rollers in?

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.439
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.820
D'you ever have time
to stand back and think

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:35.439
- "This is alright, quite good this?"
- Yeah.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.119
I dunno, yeah, I suppose so.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.159
I suppose if my husband's happy,
I'm happy.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.999
But yeah, yeah, I've done well.
I've done really well.

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:55.799
But I just wanna be able to go
and do an album again

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:00.679
and keep doing it. Just keep doing
music really rather than...

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.919
I love doing gigs, though.

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.279
I just wanna go and do
another album now... Yeah.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.559
I got a phone call
in the middle of the night

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.060
and Blake said to me
'Something's happened.

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:36.559
She doesn't know who I am and
she keeps saying your name.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:37.740
Can you come round?'

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:40.799
So I got up and I got
in the car and I started driving.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:46.740
I got a phone call
from Blake freaking out, off his nut,

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.679
saying "She's overdosed."

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.719
And I said, "Right go
to the closest hospital, now,

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.559
and I'll be there."

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.980
She was petrified. He was petrified.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:05.079
She looked like a child.
She'd scared herself, basically.

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.700
And the doctor called us
into a room and said,

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:14.380
"With the amount of cocaine,
heroin, alcohol

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.559
and crack cocaine in her blood system,

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:19.780
we're amazed she's not in a coma.

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:24.399
You've got away with it this time.
But she's a petite, young girl,

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.279
her body can't keep up with this."

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.820
She was asleep and it was very calm.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:33.140
Nicky was one side of the bed,
I was the other side of the bed

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.639
and we said, "What are we gonna do now?

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.359
How do we deal with this?"

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.879
And then it all just started up.
The whole circus started up again.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:47.159
And that's when Raye and Mitch
decided to do an intervention.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.460
Within hours there were Sun, The Mirror,

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.319
News Of The World journalists
booked up in every room.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:10.119
Every single conversation that happened
was in The Sun and The Mirror.

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.879
Fuck knows if they were hacking
the phones or whatever.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.559
And there's pictures of all
of us there, sat outside.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.279
Amy was awake by then and she was eating

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:23.959
but she wasn't well
and she wasn't right.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:28.839
The doctor that they got in
looked me dead in the eye

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:32.559
and he said to me, "If she has
another seizure, she'll die."

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:38.639
Then I was told that
she was going to America to perform.

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.839
I was like, "No, she's not."

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:45.279
We had Mitchell in a hotel room with us

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.759
begging him "Please do something."

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.959
"What am I gonna do?
She's gotta go on tour."

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.420
"Take her passport away from her.

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.700
Do something, she can't
go on tour." "She needs help."

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.919
"Can't do that,
she's got a tour booked."

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.759
So I went into her room
and I stole her passport

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.119
and then I got told,
"Well what you done that for?

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.999
She's gotta go to America.
Why have you done that?"

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:12.039
The doctor has been round to check
her blood and check everything.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:17.119
Blake's managed to get to Hook
get into her bedroom

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.519
and the next check-up
the doctors found out

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:22.119
she'd got heroin in her blood again.

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.580
When I found out with the girls
that she was taking heroin

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:30.359
and we went to this hotel
room that she was staying in,

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:33.159
and Amy just sat there
and didn't really say anything.

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:35.580
Her manager then said something like,

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.500
"Girls, there are professionals,
lawyers and doctors,

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.479
all sorts of people
that function on this stuff.

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:49.860
In helping promote the album
and get the shows on the road

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.980
I kind of done what I was supposed to do

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:55.719
and I felt that it's now
the family's responsibility.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.479
I'm here but there's only
so much I can do about this.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.399
Amy Winehouse has pulled
out of a string of concerts

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:07.719
in the US and Canada next month
because of health issues.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.540
Now she's one of Britain's
brightest talents,

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.820
but the singer Amy Winehouse
has cancelled yet more gigs,

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:16.639
this time in Norway, after she was
admitted to hospital in London yesterday.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:19.620
Her record company say it was
just down to severe exhaustion

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:22.980
but with her reputation for
hard drinking and drugs and fast...

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.860
The Amy link came about
through Russell Brand

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:29.519
who was trying to get Amy
to come into rehab.

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:33.279
And then also Mitch had got involved

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.780
and I first met Amy
when she came with Blake

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:42.540
to be assessed for treatment.
It was very much being led by Blake.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:47.679
Although she was more willing
to go to rehab than he was.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:55.340
She was a very vulnerable woman
and I felt very clearly that

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:59.559
it was a common case of
one person having a situation

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.679
that was very beneficial to their using

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.900
and not wanting the other
person to get better

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.159
for fear of losing the gravy train.

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.839
They were insistent
on doing rehab together

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:15.319
which we would have considered
to be disastrous.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:18.180
I would personally find it
almost unethical

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.279
to take the couple
into treatment at the same time.

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:24.020
But her management, and Mitch,

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.319
managed to find somewhere
where they could go together.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.479
Oh, it's recording, shit. It won't stop.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:49.119
Hey... Say hello.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.420
Hello.

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.359
Amy, got anything to say?

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.799
Only if you sing
your favourite hit 'Rehab'.

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:02.719
<i>They tried to make me go I said no.</i>

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.239
Where are we right now?

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.879
Alex? Can you say where are we?

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.519
Known to some as...

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:22.719
Can we have the new updated
version of 'Rehab', Amy? First time.

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:24.700
Amy?

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.540
I want the new version of 'Rehab'.

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.479
Please, baby,
it's for our personal private movie.

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.639
They came back from Osea Island.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:56.959
And had a suite at the hotel.
And they binged.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.180
It was ugly.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:02.359
They weren't happy souls
when they were high.

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.279
I kicked off,
I broke a bottle and I cut my arm.

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:15.199
Then she grabbed the bottle off me
and she nicked her arm.

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:18.679
And she said, "I'll do anything you do."

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.119
Come on. Amy. Look, Amy.

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:39.799
She said, "Love is,
in some ways, killing me, Raye."

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.719
She felt torn between those two things.

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.759
A guy that she really loved,

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:50.940
but having to keep up
with the consumption of substances

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.319
that they both were trying to do
at the same time.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.780
It was a horrible pendulum
of swinging one way to the other,

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:01.359
one extreme to the other all the time.

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.880
Thank you.

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:41.719
Ladies and gentlemen, Amy Winehouse.
I've worked with a lot of people.

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:45.660
She has one of the best voices
of anybody of all time.

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.279
Amy Winehouse!

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:52.919
More trouble for Amy Winehouse.

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:56.100
The singer's Camden home
was raided by police last night

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:59.679
who used a battering ram
to smash down her front door.

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.940
This was the moment police
arrested and handcuffed

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:04.719
Blake Fielder-Civil

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:08.100
on suspicion of attempting
to pervert the course of justice.

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:09.900
A spokesman for the star saying

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.399
she was in no way connected
with the arrest.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.239
Can you shut the door?

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.180
When he went to jail,

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.319
she spiralled downward very quickly.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.839
- Amy, how are you?
- Amy!

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.159
Get out of the way.

01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:58.039
Oi, out!

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:12.919
For Album of the Year

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.980
Amy Winehouse for 'Back To Black'.

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:19.740
For Best Female Pop Vocal Performance

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:22.519
Amy Winehouse for 'Rehab'.

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:27.519
Can somebody wake her up this afternoon
around six and tell her.

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.159
Drunk ass.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:34.319
For Best New Artist
the nominees are Amy Winehouse...

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:41.999
We did everything within
our power to help Amy.

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:45.759
But you can't force treatment
on somebody.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:50.439
Amy's responsibility was
to get herself well.

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.580
Okay, fellas, make some room, please.

01:23:58.680 --> 01:23:59.660
This way, this way.

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.959
I can't see the steps.

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:05.900
By then she was incredibly famous.
Very wealthy.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.700
And she had a complete
infrastructure around her

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.799
where everybody was doing
everything for her.

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:12.999
And that's not real life.

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:22.580
We had the Grammys coming up.
I said, "You need to be clean.

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:25.879
If you're not clean,
you're not doing anything."

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:31.999
So I had a contract drawn up
and it said, "You, Amy Winehouse,

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:36.239
have agreed to go to a facility now.

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.100
You're never gonna make
another record again.

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:43.500
You're never going to perform again
unless you get clean."

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.159
God bless her, she did.

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:49.479
Thank you.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:01.300
Live. It's music's biggest
night of the year

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.879
as the National Academy
of Recording Arts and Sciences

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:07.420
presents the annual Grammy Awards.

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:14.159
This is going live tonight
to the Grammys in the States.

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.600
Now the lady behind me
is up for six awards!

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:22.399
She's already won two.

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.319
I thank you.

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:32.959
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
two Grammy favourites.

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.960
Natalie Cole and Tony Bennett.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:49.180
Good evening.
Grammy history has never sounded

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:51.980
or looked any better
than this man right here.

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.319
That's right.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:00.519
Dad. Dad. Tony Bennett.

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:06.660
These are this year's nominees
for Record of the Year.

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.759
"Irreplaceable", Beyonce.

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.959
"The Pretender", Foo Fighters.

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:20.959
"Umbrella", Rihanna. Featuring Jay-Z.

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:25.759
"What Goes Around Comes Around",
Justin Timberlake.

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.060
His album's called
"What Goes Around Comes Around"?

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:30.680
And "Rehab", Amy Winehouse.

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.879
And the Grammy goes to...

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.540
Amy Winehouse!

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:03.039
Amy! Amy!

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:08.559
Er... Thank you to everyone
at Island Records.

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:12.439
Everyone at EMI Music Publishing.

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:16.180
To Raye Raye.
To Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi.

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.479
To my mum and dad.

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:24.980
For my Blake, my Blake
incarcerated and for London.

01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:26.159
This is for London.

01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.359
It was a beautiful evening.

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:43.420
You get those awards like that

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.319
it just made all the work
seem worthwhile.

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:53.999
Amy's completely clean
and looking amazing.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.159
It's just overwhelming.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.119
I was just hysterically crying.

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.620
I was so overwhelmed,
I was so proud of her.

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:10.100
And I was just flashing our whole life,

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:13.399
our childhood and then
she saw me crying.

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:17.039
Juliette, come up.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:23.079
She grabbed me, pulled me up on stage
and took me off the stage.

01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:27.100
And I was like
having a bit of a panic attack.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:28.820
I was like "I can't believe
this is happening.

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:31.159
This is amazing. I'm so proud of you."

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:36.159
And I'm looking at her trying
to get some form of reaction.

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:40.159
She went "Jules, this is
so boring without drugs."

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:46.599
And I felt really,
really, really sad for her.

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:03.959
Amy.

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:07.319
Amy, how d'you feel
after winning a Grammy?

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:08.980
Congratulations.

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.860
- Did you enjoy it? Whoops, sorry.
- I'm going to see my husband.

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:14.079
I was staying at the K-West Hotel.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:21.740
Very late in the night
she knocks on the door and I'm alone.

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.639
She comes in
and she just sits on the couch.

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:27.780
I remember feeling
like really happy for her

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:31.020
and also concerned
cos she really didn't know

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:35.359
how to be that thing that
she had been pushed to become

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:37.559
from her own success.

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:42.559
Then she pulled out this aluminium foil.

01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:45.719
She said, "Does this bother you?"

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:51.580
And I said, "Amy, I love you.
I don't mind that you get high

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:54.399
but I mind that you'll get high."

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.540
She did what she did

01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:03.039
and it was like this is someone
who is trying to disappear.

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.119
Alright, gents, give her a break now.

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:38.340
Gents, get away from the door, please.

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:41.420
Go on, mate, fuck off, please.
Sorry, mate.

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:44.300
I was called out to do security for her.

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:45.900
The security that she had

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.260
it just could not handle
the whole paparazzi situation.

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.319
See ya.

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.719
Night-night, Amy.

01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:59.460
I could feel that
she was a humble person

01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:03.100
but she was just
caught up in a bad situation.

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:06.959
Amy!

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:15.599
Amy!

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:22.999
She was not well at all physically,
mentally not well.

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:27.599
All she ever wanted
was people to tell her

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:29.999
"Pack it in, stop it."

01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:33.719
And me and Lauren
would not tolerate any of it.

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:40.639
Amy!

01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.159
It was Nick that said,

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.660
"The only thing you girls
can do is show her that

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.660
you don't wanna be a part of it

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:51.199
and when she needs help
you're there for her." Tough love.

01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:53.340
And I just said to her,

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:56.199
"If you want me to help you,
I'll help you.

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:59.820
I love you but I don't like
who you've become

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:02.239
and I don't wanna be around you'.

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:20.959
Where a lot of money,
and a lot of expectation is at stake

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:24.239
people's ideas become a bit skewed.

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:29.700
They want to try and get it
sorted out in a way that

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:34.319
doesn't upset this financial
trajectory that's going on.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.740
From the 6th of September,

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:45.540
we're not doing any more work
for the foreseeable future.

01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:49.599
Amy's going to be concentrating
on writing her new album.

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:54.740
There's five gigs
which we are obliged to do.

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:56.279
There's a couple this weekend.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.820
It was all over the media that Amy was
getting a million dollars for some shows.

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:11.079
Huge money.

01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:13.460
But by that point
it was much more likely

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.879
to not be a good show
than to be a good show.

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:20.660
She just wanted to get better.
She knew that things were wrong

01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:25.079
and she was just very exhausted
and tired of the whole situation.

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:28.420
<i>...my daddy thinks I'm fine</i>

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:31.900
<i>He's tried to make me go to rehab</i>

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.119
<i>but I won't go, go, go.</i>

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:42.159
She couldn't escape her life
in this horrible goldfish bowl.

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:45.140
She began to unravel in public
and the media treatment

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:47.740
pushed her further and further
over the edge.

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:50.620
D'you see Amy Winehouse
in the paper this week?

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:54.220
My God, she looks like a campaign poster

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.359
for neglected horses.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:33:59.919
Amy!

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:05.759
- Easy, lad.
- Fuck off!

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.599
It was like a feeding frenzy.

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.700
Suddenly it was cool to crack jokes

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:18.439
about a bulimic's appearance,
or her drug addictions.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.820
According to Contact Music dot com

01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.220
Amy Winehouse's next album
will feature songs about cooking.

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.039
About cooking, that's what they say.

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.172
Cooking crystal meth, black tar heroin.

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:46.599
Amy, cheer up.

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.599
She couldn't escape it.

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:57.439
No-one would leave her alone.
It was just disgusting.

01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:00.679
The mainstream media
were just all over her.

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:05.319
Amy Winehouse, she's like a mad person.

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:19.300
St Lucia was our place.

01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:21.980
We were supposed to be there for a week.

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:25.199
We ended up there for like six months.

01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:30.740
She decided that St Lucia was a place

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:33.039
that she really liked
and she invited me to go.

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:38.300
As soon as she went to St Lucia
there was no more crack cocaine.

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:41.679
That was done, and that's
when the heroin stopped.

01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:46.679
But give her a free bar
of course she's gonna drink.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:50.999
It was obvious
that she was supplementing

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:53.199
alcohol for drugs.

01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:00.399
I haven't seen Amy for six weeks.
We've got a lot to talk about,

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.519
a lot of exciting things happening.

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:05.100
We're talking about
the forthcoming album,

01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.319
some other business matters.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.740
So I think it's gonna be
an exciting time.

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.359
Ah-ah, naughty.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.359
Amy, Amy...

01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:19.820
She was like,

01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:22.959
"Yo, why is he bringing another
camera crew to St Lucia?

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.559
Dad, you want money?
I'll give you the money.

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:29.199
Why are you doing your life story
which is my life story?"

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:32.940
She just felt like, you know,

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:36.119
"My dad's doing a lot of stuff
for money or limelight."

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:38.020
- D'you want me to go with you?
- Yeah.

01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:39.479
You can follow us if you want.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.279
I'll ask her.

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:50.599
Amy.

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:53.020
- How d'you do it?
- We're sorry to bother you.

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:55.399
I'm really sorry. Is that alright?

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.319
- Cheers, darling.
- Okay.

01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:05.039
- How's that? Okay? Pleasure
- Thank you.

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:08.260
I've gotta say, why have you
gotta make a comment like that?

01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:11.279
Why have you gotta do that?

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:17.399
They asked to take a picture of you.

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:20.199
No... Richard,
I don't want you to do this.

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:26.319
No, that's got nothing to do with it.

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:27.759
- Dad, I don't mind.
- I'm talking to you

01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:30.639
about those two people
who wanted a lousy photograph

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:32.079
and you've gotta make 'em feel
bad about it.

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:42.839
She just wanted her dad.

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:45.340
And he didn't just come by his self.

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:48.319
He came with cameras and audio guys.

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:54.239
But she worshipped
the ground he walked on.

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:10.100
I was in jail with 500 fellas
reading the papers

01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:13.559
and there's a picture of my wife
on a beach with a fella.

01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:17.199
It's not easy to go through
things like that.

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.740
To put it bluntly, I didn't
have a high opinion of myself

01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:29.300
after the treatment I've had

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.140
for the past two years with my wife.

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:34.100
I've had the wind
knocked out of my sails.

01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.700
So I just thought, "Fuck this",
you know, I'm a big man.

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:40.079
I'm a handsome fucking guy.
I ain't on heroin.

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:42.740
I'm going to the gym a lot,
I dress well.

01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:45.639
So what the fuck am I doing
wasting my time with her?

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:31.439
And then the chorus come in
and on the last verse is:

01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:51.759
My son came up with the idea of getting

01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:54.740
the most contemporary artists
and I kept saying to myself

01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:57.919
"Who sings the right way?
The real jazz singing?"

01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:00.959
And when I heard Amy Winehouse

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:04.359
I immediately said, "This one's got it."

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:06.719
Everybody just said,

01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:08.660
"Oh, I don't know
how you're gonna handle her."

01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:10.940
- Where d'you wanna be?
- I'll be here and you there.

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:15.759
Okay. This is weird.
I've never done anything like this.

01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:17.399
I've never done anything like this.

01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:18.460
In which way?

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:21.420
- To sing with one of my idols.
- Oh, no.

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:24.700
And have it filmed.
But it's good, it's good.

01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:27.660
It's good cos then I can make
my dad jealous after,

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:29.599
when I show him. When he sees it.

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:33.319
<i>I can't believe it</i>

01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:36.119
<i>It's hard to conceive it</i>

01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:43.319
<i>That you would turn away romance</i>

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:48.399
<i>Are you pretending</i>

01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:51.959
<i>It looks like the ending</i>

01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:54.380
<i>Unless I could have</i>

01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:59.719
<i>one more chance to prove, dear.</i>

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:03.660
Sorry, sorry, it was me. I was terrible.

01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:06.140
- No, no, no, you were...
- I don't want waste your time.

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:08.660
It's getting better each time.
No, really...

01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:11.639
I just don't wanna waste
your time, that's all.

01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:20.199
We'll keep doing it till we got one.
It's right in there, okay?

01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:22.300
You're not in any hurry, are you?

01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:23.820
- No, of course I'm not.
- I'm not either.

01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:24.980
- I just...
- So we have time.

01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:27.879
I've just gotta get it right.
I'm not getting it right.

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:29.399
Oh, you are. You are.

01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:32.559
It's getting better each time
and you sound wonderful.

01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:35.239
Just a minute, I'm getting some water.

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.839
The most famous artists I ever met

01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:41.759
are the most nervous
before they hit that stage.

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:45.980
No matter how much you feel it,
you wanna feel it even more

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:48.780
so that it becomes an honest recording.

01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:51.860
And that's what Amy had.
She had that gift.

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:55.319
She was a natural, true jazz singer.

01:44:56.080 --> 01:45:00.519
And a jazz artist doesn't like
50,000 people in front of him.

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:10.119
<i>My life a wreck you're making</i>

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:17.199
<i>You know I'm yours just for the taking</i>

01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:24.879
<i>I gladly surrender</i>

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:28.519
<i>myself to you</i>

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:35.359
<i>Body and soul.</i>

01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:48.020
Beautiful.

01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:50.239
- Thank you.
- I think we got it.

01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:52.060
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:55.020
Yeah, I'm like you.
Each time it's different.

01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:57.220
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's different, you know.

01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:00.119
- It's never the same thing twice.
- Yeah, right, right.

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.620
Well, no, I'm like you.
Not you're like me.

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:08.279
I'm like you.
I get it from my idols like you.

01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:12.679
That's the right way to do it.

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:20.940
She Skyped me.

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:23.940
She was happy. The Tony Bennett thing.

01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:26.799
I mean, she was a fan.
It was about her saying

01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:28.540
"I'm not a singer, I'm a jazz singer."

01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:29.580
Hello.

01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:32.399
Then she said, "Let's do
this jazz project with Questlove."

01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:36.599
She's such a jazz snob.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.140
She would always be on
her computer sending me mp3s.

01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:42.159
"Listen to this, listen to this."

01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:46.020
I thought I'd had my doctorate
in jazz but, no, I'm like...

01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:47.919
She taught me a lot.

01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:50.220
She was like, "Alright, we're
gonna start a super group.

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:55.580
You, me, Mos and Raphael Siddiq."
I was like, "Okay".

01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:56.860
And she would like assign homework.

01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:59.639
"Alright, study this record.
Study this record."

01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:05.119
Amy had a good period.

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:10.119
She could go for four weeks
at a time with no alcohol.

01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:15.759
And she very much felt that she was
the best that she has ever been.

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:21.839
But she went to the Priory
in May to be checked

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.159
and there was some very serious
things that were being spotted.

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:30.559
There was the cumulative effect
of drinking and bulimia.

01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:37.639
She could feel perfectly fine
and have heart irregularities.

01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:41.279
Her heart can stop
if she started drinking again.

01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:47.439
I said, "Look, is this what you want?
Do you want to die?"

01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:49.759
And she said, "No, I don't want to die."

01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:57.799
All the signs were positive
and I thought,

01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:00.719
"Right, okay, we've got
a little chink of light."

01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:04.140
The Tony Bennett thing
was a good catalyst

01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:06.359
and it shows that she still had it.

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:09.919
We had the offers to do these shows.

01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:12.500
And I said to her,
"You don't have to do them.

01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:15.020
There's no pressure.
We've got no record to promote."

01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:16.999
But she wanted to do it.

01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:21.060
She Skyped me, she wanted
to do all these other projects

01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:23.420
with Questlove and Mos Def.

01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:27.399
She was like, "I don't need this."
She just didn't wanna go.

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:32.079
The material felt so tired

01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:34.860
and didn't feel relevant
to her any more.

01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:36.879
But because she was such a huge star

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.799
and there was all
of these different pressures

01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:41.980
she had to keep performing
'Back To Black'.

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:44.079
She didn't wanna do that.

01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:49.199
As soon as she knew
that tour was looming

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:51.839
she got wasted.

01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:54.719
Wasted so that
she wouldn't be able to go.

01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:14.639
Amy was passed out, asleep, on her sofa.

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:18.159
She gets put in the back
of a car, asleep

01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:23.999
and she wakes up at the airport
and gets put on a private jet.

01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:59.359
Amy! Amy!

01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:00.860
Amy! Amy!

01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:06.559
Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy!

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.879
Introducing Amy Winehouse!

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:02.439
Amy! Amy!

01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:12.719
I wasn't sure what was going on.

01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:15.460
She just wouldn't sing.

01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:17.999
It was the first time ever
that had happened.

01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:21.239
It felt like the end.

01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:26.599
It was someone who just
really didn't care anymore.

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:32.540
To the extent where
she was willing to sabotage

01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:36.140
not just her career but her friendships

01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:38.919
and her musical relationships.

01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:57.220
But it's amazing to me, why do they
keep putting her on the stage?

01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:59.919
Because surely her managers
know she has a problem?

01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:02.239
This was supposed to be
a major comeback,

01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:04.559
and she totally blew it.

01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:16.359
Go!

01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:34.399
The 24th of July was my wedding day

01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:38.260
and Amy was due to be
at the wedding and we'd spoken.

01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:41.319
And I felt like she was really
excited about my wedding.

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:43.060
And she said she hadn't been drinking

01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:46.020
and she can't wait to
see the family, and Salaam.

01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:49.119
Some people that were
on the journey were gonna be there.

01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:58.900
She rang me up and I looked at the phone

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.580
and I thought, "Oh, my God".
Like, "What's happened now?

01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:02.919
"cos that's the first thing
that goes in my head

01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:04.180
and she just went "Jules".

01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:07.239
And it was my Amy, completely normal.

01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:10.700
And all she kept saying was,

01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:13.780
and she'd never done this before,
She just kept saying "Sorry".

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:16.180
It was like complete clarity
over the whole situation

01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:17.620
of the nightmare of the past

01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:20.020
however many years
that we'd just gone through.

01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:22.119
"Jules, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:23.759
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry."

01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:25.479
You know like
when you're a kid and you panic

01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:27.220
that you've done something wrong

01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:31.340
and you wanna just fix
it there and then, that's how it was.

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:34.500
I just wanted to go and grab her,
bring her back to me.

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:37.119
Wrap her in my house, not let her out.

01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:40.180
And she called me the next day.

01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:42.940
And it was just so weird
hearing her talk normally

01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:46.340
because, for so long,
we'd just been pining for her

01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:48.519
to just like I missed my best friend.

01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:49.980
Lauren missed her best friend.

01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:52.839
We just wanted to have
a normal conversation.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.300
She just kept going, "Can I see you?"

01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:57.820
"Will Lauren speak to me?"
"Can we start again?"

01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:00.519
I was like "Of course we can.
We're always here, you know we are.

01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:02.740
We've been waiting for you
to talk to us."

01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:04.380
And she said,
"Right, I'm gonna call you tomorrow",

01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:08.319
and I was like "Okay, I love you."
"I love you, too."

01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:31.039
She just looked like she was sleeping.

01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:34.999
She was on top of the bed
just... sleeping.

01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:39.999
But she was gone.

01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:16.959
No!

01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:20.119
Oh, my God!

01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:24.719
Rest in peace, Amy.

01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:35.079
Amy's blood alcohol level was

01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:38.359
four to five times higher
than the drink driving limit.

01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:41.439
Maybe a combination
of her eating disorders

01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:45.479
and the alcohol
just made her heart stop.

01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:58.999
She was one of the truest
jazz singers I ever heard.

01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:02.919
To me she should be treated
like Ella Fitzgerald,

01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:06.679
like Billie Holiday.
She had the complete gift.

01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:10.439
If she had lived, I would have said,

01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:14.159
"Slow down, you're too important.

01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:16.679
Life teaches you really how to live it,

01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:19.079
if you can live long enough."

01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:41.519
<i>Well, sometimes I go out by myself</i>

01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:44.799
<i>And I look across the water</i>

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:51.420
<i>And I think of all the things
what you're doing</i>

01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:55.319
<i>And in my head I paint a picture</i>

01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:03.119
<i>Since I've come home
Well my body's been a mess</i>

02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:05.620
<i>And I've missed your ginger hair</i>

02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:08.879
<i>And the way you like to dress</i>

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.460
<i>Won't you come on over</i>

02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:15.999
<i>Stop making a fool out of me</i>

02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:20.319
<i>Why don't you come on over, Valerie</i>

02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:27.345
<i>Valerie</i>

02:00:28.270 --> 02:00:31.304
<i>Valerie</i>

02:00:33.437 --> 02:00:36.936
<i>Valerie</i>

02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:41.119
<i>Did you have to go to jail</i>

02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:43.260
<i>Put your house up for sale</i>

02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:46.599
<i>Did you get a good lawyer</i>

02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:51.119
<i>I hope you didn't catch a tan</i>

02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:56.199
<i>I hope you find the right man
who'll fix it for ya</i>

02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:01.119
<i>And now you're shopping anywhere</i>

02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:03.300
<i>Changed the colour of your hair</i>

02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:05.999
<i>And are you busy?</i>

02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:11.079
<i>And did you have to pay that fine?</i>

02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:13.100
<i>That you were dodging all the time</i>

02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:15.799
<i>Are you still dizzy?</i>

02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:20.780
<i>Since I've come home</i>

02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:23.479
<i>Well my body's been a mess</i>

02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:25.780
<i>And I've missed your ginger hair</i>

02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:29.039
<i>And the way you like to dress</i>

02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:31.620
<i>Won't you come on over</i>

02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:35.879
<i>Stop making a fool out of me</i>

02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:40.919
<i>Why don't you come on over, Valerie</i>

02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:46.011
