LINDSAY:
Previously on "The Practice"...

00:02.150 --> 00:03.150
- This is an emergency.

00:03.150 --> 00:04.220
I need to talk to someone.

00:04.220 --> 00:06.100
- George?

00:06.100 --> 00:08.000
- My bag, open it.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.150
- [screams]

00:09.150 --> 00:10.180
- What?

00:10.180 --> 00:12.150
- There's a head in the bag.

00:12.150 --> 00:14.030
- It's the woman I met
at the bar last night.

00:14.030 --> 00:15.170
- What are you doing
with her head?

00:15.170 --> 00:16.200
- I don't know.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.070
Somebody put it in there.

00:18.070 --> 00:20.040
MAN: George Vogelman,
you are under arrest

00:20.040 --> 00:22.050
for the murder of Susan Robin.

00:22.050 --> 00:24.010
- Anderson Pearson,
my stuffed shirt professor?

00:24.010 --> 00:25.120
He just shot somebody dead.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.220
- I'd like to go self-defense.

00:26.220 --> 00:28.130
- The man was unarmed.

00:28.130 --> 00:30.000
- And talking to your wife,
you two felt like

00:30.000 --> 00:32.180
this man might end up
hurting you one day.

00:32.180 --> 00:35.210
- But we weren't at that point
when your client shot him.

00:35.210 --> 00:37.210
- I think that's a question
of fact left for the jury.

00:37.210 --> 00:40.030
- The jury is not going
to get that question, Bobby.

00:40.030 --> 00:41.220
- You can't limit our defense
to what you--

00:41.220 --> 00:44.120
- You don't want to be
arguing self-defense.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.140
- Do you think you were acting
in self-defense,

00:46.140 --> 00:49.120
or do you think
you involuntarily

00:49.120 --> 00:51.220
just started squeezing?

00:51.220 --> 00:54.050
- I don't remember
pulling the trigger.

00:54.050 --> 00:55.140
- Good.

00:55.140 --> 00:57.060
- We need an expert
to take the stand

00:57.060 --> 00:59.150
and basically testify
that between the light trigger

00:59.150 --> 01:01.190
and the automatic recoil,
it is possible

01:01.190 --> 01:03.130
for a man
to just sort of squeeze

01:03.130 --> 01:05.090
and have
the entire magazine empty.

01:05.090 --> 01:06.230
- What's the fee?

01:06.230 --> 01:09.070
- The victim was being treated.
- Shrink?

01:09.070 --> 01:10.200
- Dr. Walter Matthews
diagnosed him

01:10.200 --> 01:12.070
as a schizophrenic.

01:12.070 --> 01:13.190
This is good.
- We need to meet with him.

01:13.190 --> 01:15.100
- Things I learn in therapy,

01:15.100 --> 01:16.190
they're privileged.

01:16.190 --> 01:20.020
- This case involves
a murder, Doctor.

01:25.070 --> 01:27.000
LINDSAY: Too personal?
BOBBY: I don't think so.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.030
- It certainly isn't
relevant to how--

01:28.030 --> 01:29.030
- You'll get slack.

01:29.030 --> 01:30.130
The last thing the DA wants

01:30.130 --> 01:31.230
is to get up and object
to an opening statement,

01:31.230 --> 01:33.190
but here
starting on page three,

01:33.190 --> 01:35.170
you got to tone this down.

01:35.170 --> 01:37.030
- That's sort of
our story, Bobby.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.180
- The problem is,
if you tell it,

01:38.180 --> 01:41.090
you steal the thunder
of Pearson's testimony.

01:41.090 --> 01:42.230
That's where this thing
is won or lost,

01:42.230 --> 01:44.100
with him on the stand.

01:44.100 --> 01:46.180
Don't go near the dead cat.
- Really?

01:46.180 --> 01:49.140
- They got to
hear that from him.

01:49.140 --> 01:52.140
- Do you think he's guilty?

01:52.140 --> 01:55.230
- I think under that
set of circumstances,

01:55.230 --> 01:57.070
a lot of people would have
pulled the trigger.

01:57.070 --> 01:58.100
- Yeah, out of revenge,
maybe,

01:58.100 --> 01:59.130
but we can't go with revenge.

01:59.130 --> 02:01.030
Our case is accident.
God.

02:01.030 --> 02:03.050
- Our case is getting the jury
to want to let him go.

02:03.050 --> 02:06.070
If we can do that,
they'll find accident.

02:06.070 --> 02:07.080
- Then Judge Hiller
will give them

02:07.080 --> 02:08.190
the instruction of a lifetime.

He's like my father.

10:26.140 --> 10:28.160
- Eugene, they're not even
looking for anybody else.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.220
- They usually don't,
Ellenor,

10:29.220 --> 10:31.180
when they think they got a guy.

10:31.180 --> 10:33.090
To them,
this case is solved,

10:33.090 --> 10:34.210
which means
we got to investigate,

10:34.210 --> 10:36.200
and we start
by making two lists.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.180
One: who would want
to frame George Vogelman?

10:39.180 --> 10:42.030
Two: who would want
Susan Robin dead?

10:42.030 --> 10:43.100
It's possible George

10:43.100 --> 10:44.170
just represented
somebody's chance

10:44.170 --> 10:46.030
to get away with murder,

10:46.030 --> 10:48.170
and this whole thing
is more about that.

10:48.170 --> 10:50.220
- Just got a little
inside tip from Lindsay.

10:50.220 --> 10:52.130
Helen told her.

10:52.130 --> 10:54.220
George and the victim
did not leave the bar together.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.090
- Did he make
any statement to the effect

11:01.090 --> 11:03.120
that he thought
the victim was armed?

11:03.120 --> 11:05.020
- No, he didn't.

11:05.020 --> 11:06.100
- And detective,

11:06.100 --> 11:07.160
was there any evidence
of a struggle?

11:07.160 --> 11:09.030
- No, sir.

11:09.030 --> 11:11.100
- Any evidence that suggested
that the victim

11:11.100 --> 11:13.190
could have been
moving toward the defendant?

11:13.190 --> 11:15.080
- No.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.060
We concluded the victim
was standing flat-footed,

11:17.060 --> 11:19.020
about 40 inches
away from the defendant

11:19.020 --> 11:20.020
at the time of shooting.

11:20.020 --> 11:21.200
- How could you tell that?

11:21.200 --> 11:23.120
- The powder burns
on the victim,

11:23.120 --> 11:26.120
footprints,
the defendant's statement.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.060
He said so himself.

11:28.060 --> 11:30.140
- In fact, Mr. Pearson
was very forthcoming, wasn't he?

11:30.140 --> 11:32.060
- Yes.

11:32.060 --> 11:34.030
- And it was Mr. Pearson's wife
that called the police.

11:34.030 --> 11:35.170
- That's correct.

11:35.170 --> 11:39.050
- Did the Pearsons ever
ask the police to do something,

11:39.050 --> 11:40.180
to protect them from Mr. Breyer?

11:40.180 --> 11:42.180
- They did.
- And how did you respond?

11:42.180 --> 11:44.160
- We advised them
to seek a restraining order.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.060
- And to your knowledge,

11:46.060 --> 11:47.180
they got a restraining order,
didn't they?

11:47.180 --> 11:49.150
- Yes, they did.

11:49.150 --> 11:52.110
- And yet,
here was Mr. Breyer again,

11:52.110 --> 11:53.200
coming to their house.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.110
- That seems to be the case.

11:55.110 --> 11:57.140
- And this Mr. Breyer,
he had a police record, correct?

11:57.140 --> 11:58.140
- That's correct.

11:58.140 --> 12:00.000
- Three assault convictions,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.130
one battery with a tire iron.

12:02.130 --> 12:05.010
Did you also have knowledge that
he was a paranoid schizophrenic?

12:05.010 --> 12:06.210
- I have knowledge of it today,
yes, I do.

12:06.210 --> 12:09.150
- If he were harassing you,
Detective,

12:09.150 --> 12:12.060
and he rang your doorbell
one night,

12:12.060 --> 12:15.110
would you answer the door
without your gun?

12:15.110 --> 12:16.230
- Probably not.

12:16.230 --> 12:19.060
- Thank you.

12:23.170 --> 12:25.220
- Would you shoot him
five times?

12:25.220 --> 12:27.130
- No, I wouldn't.

12:30.180 --> 12:33.080
JUDGE HILLER: The witness
may step down.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.160
Mr. Bullock?

12:42.230 --> 12:46.080
- The Commonwealth rests,
Your Honor.

12:46.080 --> 12:54.070
<i>♪ ♪</i>

13:05.150 --> 13:08.060
- Maybe it's good.
- It's not good!

13:08.060 --> 13:10.160
You don't just put up
one witness in a murder trial.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.100
- So what are they up to?

13:12.100 --> 13:14.110
- My bet is they're saving
their case for rebuttal,

13:14.110 --> 13:16.100
hoping to get you in a lie.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.100
- But he's admitted everything.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.130
What's to impeach?

13:18.130 --> 13:20.170
- Is there anything?
- No.

13:20.170 --> 13:22.180
- Well, if you make a single
mistake of fact up there,

13:22.180 --> 13:24.100
they'll put up
the coroner or whoever

13:24.100 --> 13:26.140
to paint it as a lie.

13:26.140 --> 13:28.120
That's what this is about.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.150
Smart.

13:29.150 --> 13:31.030
- Except if we don't put him on,

13:31.030 --> 13:33.150
those experts
can't testify at all now.

13:33.150 --> 13:35.030
- They satisfied their burden.

13:35.030 --> 13:37.010
He has to go up.

13:37.010 --> 13:38.120
Go over the autopsy reports
with him.

13:38.120 --> 13:39.190
I got to get a hold
of Dr. Matthews

13:39.190 --> 13:41.060
and our weapons guy.

13:41.060 --> 13:43.150
They could be taking
the stand by tomorrow.

13:43.150 --> 13:45.040
I'll see you after lunch.

13:57.050 --> 14:00.100
- This isn't that perverted.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.060
I mean,
at least it's film.

14:02.060 --> 14:03.210
Some of the stuff
on videotape...

14:03.210 --> 14:06.080
- That last scene had
some sadomasochism going on.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.230
- You have to
suppress this, Ellenor.

14:07.230 --> 14:09.220
- Well, you can get this
late at night on Showtime,

14:09.220 --> 14:11.000
I mean, what's the--

14:11.000 --> 14:13.210
oh, not that, you can't.

14:13.210 --> 14:15.070
- If this gets
admitted into evidence,

14:15.070 --> 14:16.180
George is gonna
look like a sicko--

14:16.180 --> 14:18.070
- Let's mark up
a motion to suppress.

14:18.070 --> 14:20.030
Jimmy, I could use
that research you did on Davis.

14:20.030 --> 14:21.170
- All right,
I can pull it right up.

14:21.170 --> 14:24.170
You know, I think two women
together can be sensual.

14:24.170 --> 14:26.060
- Well great.

14:26.060 --> 14:28.120
We'll call you up
as a character witness.

14:32.160 --> 14:34.100
- He would call.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.180
He would drive by the house.

14:36.180 --> 14:38.080
He was terrifying us.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.130
- You said he would call.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.200
Did you talk to him?

14:41.200 --> 14:43.020
- Well,
at first we answered,

14:43.020 --> 14:45.170
but then we knew better
than to pick up,

14:45.170 --> 14:47.090
so he began leaving messages.

14:47.090 --> 14:48.160
- What kind of messages?

14:48.160 --> 14:51.020
- Most of them
were along the lines of,

14:51.020 --> 14:53.200
"You think you're better
than I am because you're rich,

14:53.200 --> 14:56.150
but money can't buy
your health, you know."

14:56.150 --> 14:58.020
He did say that all the time.

14:58.020 --> 15:00.010
- And when you got
the restraining order?

15:00.010 --> 15:01.070
- Well, it stopped
for a few weeks.

15:01.070 --> 15:03.090
Then--well,
one morning I went out,

15:03.090 --> 15:05.120
and I saw the garage
had been broken into,

15:05.120 --> 15:08.090
my car had been scraped,
a window had been smashed.

15:08.090 --> 15:09.190
- Mr. Breyer did it?

15:09.190 --> 15:13.050
- Yeah, we can only assume.

15:13.050 --> 15:15.230
A few days later,

15:15.230 --> 15:18.060
we were watching television
at night.

15:22.230 --> 15:27.070
I got up to go to the kitchen,

15:27.070 --> 15:29.090
and there he was at the window.

15:29.090 --> 15:32.050
- So what did you do?
- I called the police.

15:32.050 --> 15:33.060
They said they'd arrest him.

15:33.060 --> 15:35.020
- Did they?
- No.

15:35.020 --> 15:39.040
On the next night,
I had just gotten home.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.180
It was barely dark,

15:41.180 --> 15:46.010
and suddenly Meredith yelled,
"He's back!"

15:51.080 --> 15:53.160
I looked out,
and there he was

15:53.160 --> 15:55.040
coming up the walkway.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.000
BOBBY: So what did you do?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.120
ANDERSON: I went and got my gun.
BOBBY: You keep a gun.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.100
ANDERSON: Well, I bought it
because of this man.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.140
- And when you went
to get your gun,

16:04.140 --> 16:07.140
was if your intent to use it?

16:07.140 --> 16:10.020
- My intent was
to let him know I was armed,

16:10.020 --> 16:12.100
and I would use it
to protect myself or my family.

16:12.100 --> 16:14.030
- So what happened?

16:14.030 --> 16:16.160
- I opened the door, and he...

16:18.120 --> 16:21.170
He held up my cat.

16:21.170 --> 16:23.020
It was dead.

16:23.020 --> 16:25.070
It looked as if
it had been strangled.

16:25.070 --> 16:27.060
- And then what happened?

16:27.060 --> 16:29.080
ANDERSON: He dropped it
at my feet,

16:29.080 --> 16:33.210
said, "Something seems to be
wrong with your cat."

16:35.130 --> 16:40.040
The next thing I remember,
I was raising my gun,

16:40.040 --> 16:41.040
pointing it at him.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.140
I threatened him.

16:42.140 --> 16:44.180
I told him if he ever
tried to hurt us--

16:44.180 --> 16:46.050
- And how did he respond?

16:46.050 --> 16:47.200
- Well, he--he--he mocked me.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.200
How could he hurt us?

16:48.200 --> 16:50.070
He was just a mouse.

16:50.070 --> 16:52.020
And then--then he said

16:52.020 --> 16:55.080
"Maybe it was a mouse
that got your cat."

16:55.080 --> 16:59.060
And--and I could see it

16:59.060 --> 17:00.120
in his eyes.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.130
BOBBY: See what?

17:01.130 --> 17:04.050
- He was going to hurt us.

17:04.050 --> 17:06.010
- Then what?

17:06.010 --> 17:08.200
- The next thing I remember,
the gun was going off,

17:08.200 --> 17:12.060
and he was falling backwards.

17:12.060 --> 17:13.119
Meredith was screaming,

17:13.119 --> 17:17.060
and he was lying there bleeding.

17:20.069 --> 17:23.040
- You shot him.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.210
- Yes.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.089
- Professor Pearson,

17:26.089 --> 17:31.090
did you willfully
shoot this man?

17:31.090 --> 17:33.010
- I don't know.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.110
- You don't know.

17:34.110 --> 17:37.220
- But I felt myself
getting angry,

17:37.220 --> 17:39.120
and I looked at the cat,

17:39.120 --> 17:42.080
and my hand,
it just clenched,

17:42.080 --> 17:43.220
and I was squeezing the gun,

17:43.220 --> 17:46.150
and bullets were coming out.

17:46.150 --> 17:51.060
It was not something
I decided to do.

depressed about that?

get in the car with you?

19:51.050 --> 19:52.110

What, they think
I abducted her now?

go to a motel, George?

You've got your place;
she has hers.

Why a motel?

I don't know.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.170
I'll find somebody else.

20:34.110 --> 20:38.040
- I have a motion scheduled
to suppress the videotapes.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.190
We don't want them
coming into evidence.

will try to use them.

21:04.140 --> 21:07.050
Anybody I can call for you?

21:07.050 --> 21:08.230
- No.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.230
- You say that your hand
just squeezed,

21:22.230 --> 21:24.190
and bullets started coming out?

21:24.190 --> 21:25.190
- Yes.

21:25.190 --> 21:27.060
- Did you squeeze just once,

21:27.060 --> 21:29.020
or did you squeeze five times?

21:30.020 --> 21:31.120
- You don't remember.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.180

Mr. Bullock.

21:33.180 --> 21:34.180
Enraged.

21:34.180 --> 21:36.170
The man had killed my cat.

I was thinking probably
he'd kill me, maybe my wife.

21:39.070 --> 21:42.030

about to kill you or your wife

21:42.030 --> 21:43.190
when you pulled the trigger?

21:43.190 --> 21:45.120
- Well no,
not at that second, but--

21:45.120 --> 21:49.010
- So you do have some memory
of what you were thinking,

21:49.010 --> 21:51.110
and you did pull the trigger?

21:51.110 --> 21:54.020
- I didn't consciously pull it.

21:54.020 --> 21:55.230
It just went off.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.230
- Five times!
- Yes.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.140
the squeeze and release.

22:07.140 --> 22:09.160
Which, I am told,
is the only way

22:09.160 --> 22:12.220

have gone off five times.

24:44.020 --> 24:48.160
We still need only one juror.

All he had to do was
stick with, "I don't remember."

24:53.160 --> 24:55.180
I guess we should have
coached him a little better.

24:55.180 --> 24:59.050
- Bobby, we did everything
but suborn perjury as it was.

24:59.050 --> 25:02.020

this isn't over.

25:15.050 --> 25:17.140

no relevance whatsoever,

25:17.140 --> 25:19.100
except a comment
on my client's character,

25:19.100 --> 25:20.230
which is totally inadmissible.

25:20.230 --> 25:22.050
- We'd be offering the tapes

25:22.050 --> 25:23.100
only to show a pattern,
Your Honor.

25:23.100 --> 25:24.210
- A pattern?

25:24.210 --> 25:26.160
- Some of the tapes
involve sexual scenes,

25:26.160 --> 25:28.090
which border on sadomasochism.

25:28.090 --> 25:31.080
We believe we can show
a statistical correlation

25:31.080 --> 25:33.070
between the men
who commit sex crimes--

25:33.070 --> 25:36.040
- This is so ridiculous!
- Can I finish?

25:36.040 --> 25:37.090
- This is a homicide case.

25:37.090 --> 25:39.020
It is not a sex crime.

25:39.020 --> 25:40.130
- We don't know that, Counsel.

25:40.130 --> 25:42.040
- There is no evidence
of rape or forced--

25:42.040 --> 25:45.210
- Nor is there
any conclusive evidence

25:45.210 --> 25:47.210
that the intercourse
didn't occur

25:47.210 --> 25:49.060
after she was headless.

25:52.030 --> 25:54.170
- Your Honor,
as an officer of this court,

25:54.170 --> 25:55.220
I must go on record

25:55.220 --> 25:57.140
with my disgust
with that comment.

25:57.140 --> 26:00.130
- Take exception all you want,
but the fact remains--

26:00.130 --> 26:03.090
- The police have never even
suggested such a scenario.

26:03.090 --> 26:05.020
I doubt they even considered it.

26:05.020 --> 26:06.090
- Maybe they should.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.080
- Under the heading
that depravity, too,

26:10.080 --> 26:11.210
can be in the eye
of the beholder,

26:11.210 --> 26:13.120
I would ask that you
be recused from this case.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.140

26:14.140 --> 26:16.050

George Vogelman

26:16.050 --> 26:18.050
could not be capable
of having such a sick thought.

26:18.050 --> 26:19.100
I would hate for him
to be in the hands

26:19.100 --> 26:20.220
of a judge who could be.

26:20.220 --> 26:22.040
- Look, we're getting
way off track now.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.080
The issue today
is these videotapes.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.090
- I want to see
the specific tapes

26:26.090 --> 26:28.020
we are talking about before--

26:28.020 --> 26:30.010
- You would.
- Ellenor.

26:30.010 --> 26:32.200
- I will see
the tapes in question.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.190
Then I'll make my ruling.

26:40.050 --> 26:41.200
- Defense calls
Dr. Walter Matthews

26:41.200 --> 26:43.180
to the stand.

26:43.180 --> 26:45.160
- Sidebar, Your Honor.

26:53.170 --> 26:56.100
We object to this witness
on grounds of relevance.

26:56.100 --> 26:58.060
- What's your offer of proof?

26:58.060 --> 27:00.020
- Dr. Matthews will testify
that Mr. Breyer

27:00.020 --> 27:02.050
posed a risk of danger
to my client and his family.

27:02.050 --> 27:03.140
- Which might be relevant

27:03.140 --> 27:04.200
if you were
arguing self-defense,

27:04.200 --> 27:07.050
but under the theory
that Mr. Pearson

27:07.050 --> 27:09.210
involuntarily pulled
the trigger,

27:09.210 --> 27:12.100
the victim's state of mind
has no meaning.

27:12.100 --> 27:14.030
- I agree.
- Your Honor.

27:14.030 --> 27:15.210
Panic, fear, anger.

27:15.210 --> 27:19.070
It all factored into my client
clenching on to that gun

27:19.070 --> 27:22.150
to the extent that the victim
posed a risk of bodily harm.

27:22.150 --> 27:25.150
- You're trying to squeeze
in self-defense, Counsel.

27:25.150 --> 27:26.180
- We're not.

27:26.180 --> 27:28.060
- The only thing relevant

27:28.060 --> 27:30.050
is your client's
state of mind.

27:30.050 --> 27:32.100
This witness has
nothing to say to that.

27:32.100 --> 27:33.210
This witness will speak
to the threat

27:33.210 --> 27:35.110
posed by the victim,

27:35.110 --> 27:37.060
which goes to Anderson Pearson's
state of mind.

27:37.060 --> 27:39.020
- It's a nice try.

27:39.020 --> 27:41.000
- You are shutting down
our whole defense.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.190
- I'm shutting down this guy.

27:43.190 --> 27:45.070
He's not relevant.

27:45.070 --> 27:47.070
- I want our objection
noted for the record.

27:47.070 --> 27:49.050
- So noted.
Step back.

27:51.110 --> 27:54.090
- Dr. Matthews,
you're excused.

28:00.070 --> 28:01.120
- Get out of my face, Eugene.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.160
- I'm in your face, Ellenor,

28:02.160 --> 28:04.050
and I will stay
in your face until--

28:04.050 --> 28:05.160
- A guy says something
like that in open court,

28:05.160 --> 28:06.190
I don't care
if he's a judge, or--

28:06.190 --> 28:08.080
- The point is
to win a motion.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.090
You taking on a judge
doesn't help us if--

28:09.090 --> 28:10.190
- We already lost the motion.

28:10.190 --> 28:12.060
- You don't know that!
- What happened?

28:12.060 --> 28:13.150
- She went ballistic on a judge
in open court.

28:13.150 --> 28:15.150
- I did not go ballistic.
- All right.

28:15.150 --> 28:18.190
- He suggested that my client
had sex with a headless corpse.

28:18.190 --> 28:21.040
I'm supposed to just--
- Maybe he did us a favor.

28:21.040 --> 28:22.200
- What?

28:22.200 --> 28:24.140
- Well, now we got an idea
of how people see things.

28:24.140 --> 28:26.170
Ellenor, this was a beautiful
woman with a boyfriend.

28:26.170 --> 28:28.000
You ever ask yourself
what the hell

28:28.000 --> 28:29.110
she's doing with George?

28:29.110 --> 28:30.230
Maybe you just assume
a pretty girl

28:30.230 --> 28:32.150
would go to a motel
with a schlub like him,

28:32.150 --> 28:33.210
but the jury won't.

28:33.210 --> 28:35.010
You keep looking at this
and saying,

28:35.010 --> 28:36.090
"Of course he's innocent,"

28:36.090 --> 28:38.020
but you're the only
one doing that,

28:38.020 --> 28:39.220
and if you don't get
some perspective real fast,

28:39.220 --> 28:41.160
than at least be a good lawyer
and a good friend

28:41.160 --> 28:43.100
and tell George to hire himself
a new attorney,

28:43.100 --> 28:45.080
'cause he didn't have
a good one in court today.

28:48.170 --> 28:51.020
- It's an extremely
light trigger.

28:51.020 --> 28:54.010
This is a sophisticated
and sensitive firearm.

28:54.010 --> 28:56.100
- Now, you heard
Mr. Pearson's testimony,

28:56.100 --> 28:59.070
that his hand clenched
on the trigger,

28:59.070 --> 29:01.190
and five shots fired.

29:01.190 --> 29:03.230
Is that possible, Mr. Schramm?

29:03.230 --> 29:05.060
- If he squeezed
the trigger one time,

29:05.060 --> 29:06.170
it would not be possible

29:06.170 --> 29:08.160
for the weapon
to discharge five times, no.

29:11.090 --> 29:12.180
- Is it your testimony

29:12.180 --> 29:14.060
that it's impossible,
Mr. Schramm?

29:14.060 --> 29:16.220
- The way he described it.

29:16.220 --> 29:18.110
I think what happened was this:

29:18.110 --> 29:22.130
his hand seized up a little,
and it trembled,

29:22.130 --> 29:25.100
causing the fingers to shake,

29:25.100 --> 29:26.230
maybe even twitch a little bit.

29:26.230 --> 29:29.000
If that happened,
it's not only possible

29:29.000 --> 29:31.090
for the gun to go off
again and again.

29:31.090 --> 29:34.120
I would consider it likely.
- Likely.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.190
- Yeah,
you have to understand

29:35.190 --> 29:39.000
this gun has
an automatic recoil.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.180
If his hand is trembling,
pulling at the trigger--

29:41.180 --> 29:43.090
but not pulling too hard--

29:43.090 --> 29:47.230
it will recoil automatically
and fire automatically.

29:47.230 --> 29:51.150
It's extremely plausible.

29:51.150 --> 29:52.220
- Thank you.

29:52.220 --> 29:54.170
- Not only do I reject
that likelihood,

29:54.170 --> 29:57.020
I'm offended
by Mr. Schramm's testimony.

29:57.020 --> 29:58.160
- Why is that, sir?

29:58.160 --> 30:01.000
- Well, as manufacturer
of this particular firearm,

30:01.000 --> 30:05.120
I take exception to the notion
that these weapons just go off

30:05.120 --> 30:07.100
with the tremble of a finger.

30:07.100 --> 30:08.180
It's preposterous.

30:08.180 --> 30:10.110
You have to pull,

30:10.110 --> 30:12.110
semiautomatic or not.

30:12.110 --> 30:14.060
- Of course,
if these guns could go off

30:14.060 --> 30:16.110
with a trembling squeeze,
you might be exposed

30:16.110 --> 30:18.100
to a massive
product liability action.

30:18.100 --> 30:20.010
- Which is one of the reasons
we wouldn't let the gun

30:20.010 --> 30:21.170
be so temperamental.

30:21.170 --> 30:23.040
- And also a reason you'd be
be sitting in court

30:23.040 --> 30:24.230
spouting that it could
never happen.

30:28.150 --> 30:30.180
- I can't say
the morning went well,

30:30.180 --> 30:32.180
but Schramm was much better
than I ever thought.

30:32.180 --> 30:34.030
The trembling fingers.

30:34.030 --> 30:36.000
He could have bought us
reasonable doubt.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.200
- So where are we?

30:38.200 --> 30:40.110
- I would love to be able
to put on a witness

30:40.110 --> 30:42.180

his face going red.

to your husband?

31:47.090 --> 31:48.120

31:49.190 --> 31:51.080
his face is going red,

31:51.080 --> 31:53.050

No.

for executing a man.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.220
