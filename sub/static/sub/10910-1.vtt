00:42.275 --> 00:44.818
Aw! Enough of that shit!

00:46.154 --> 00:47.780
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.782
Don't call me a bitch.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.299
You're so beautiful.

01:39.541 --> 01:41.875
Get out of your fucking room!
Turn it lower, for God's sake!

01:42.043 --> 01:43.877
Sorry, Mom!

02:20.248 --> 02:21.707
Are you all right, kid?

02:25.253 --> 02:27.504
You little fuck!

02:38.308 --> 02:41.477
- Did you make this?
- No.

02:43.229 --> 02:45.105
Your cellmate told me
you made this.

02:45.273 --> 02:46.815
Don't hit me again.

02:50.278 --> 02:52.071
Don't do that again, man!

02:52.238 --> 02:54.948
- Are you threatening me, boy?
- I'm fucking threatening you, man!

02:55.116 --> 02:57.701
- Do you know where you are?
- Fucking right, bitch!

02:57.869 --> 02:59.995
Fuck you!
Don't do it again!

03:05.460 --> 03:08.712
I'm gonna come back in five
and you're gonna give me a name.

03:10.298 --> 03:11.632
And that's an order.

03:24.145 --> 03:25.437
Fucking cunt!

03:26.898 --> 03:27.981
Fuck you!

03:47.752 --> 03:49.503
Gentlemen, strip out of
your civilian clothes

03:49.671 --> 03:52.506
and place all of your belongings
in the box with your name on it.

03:52.674 --> 03:55.217
We'll give back your shoes
once this search is complete.

03:55.385 --> 03:57.636
All of your belongings.

03:58.805 --> 03:59.972
Shake your hair.

04:01.141 --> 04:02.808
Wiggle your fingers.

04:03.143 --> 04:04.518
Spread your toes.

04:05.436 --> 04:06.728
Blow your nose.

04:13.736 --> 04:15.362
Now turn around.

04:19.659 --> 04:20.868
Bend over.

04:23.788 --> 04:25.205
Cough.

04:26.749 --> 04:27.749
Harder.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.002
Stand up.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.255
Turn around.

04:35.133 --> 04:37.050
Okay, boys,
now we'll get you dressed.

04:38.386 --> 04:41.013
Gentlemen, welcome to Enola Vale
Youth Correctional Facility.

04:41.181 --> 04:43.015
I'm your superintendent,
Mr. Sands.

04:43.183 --> 04:46.768
If you have any problems
or any questions during your stay here,

04:46.936 --> 04:48.896
you will report them
to your unit supervisor,

04:49.063 --> 04:50.731
in this case,
Officer Goodyear.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.774
He will then report it to me.

04:52.942 --> 04:55.736
As for school,
your re-socialization unit supervisor...

04:57.280 --> 04:58.780
...basic rules around the place.

04:58.948 --> 05:00.991
You better be listening.

05:01.159 --> 05:03.869
No weapons, no sharp items.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.954
No pornographic material,
no illegal substance,

05:06.122 --> 05:08.415
no tobacco, no alcohol

05:08.583 --> 05:11.793
and no signs of gang activity
will be permitted

05:11.961 --> 05:13.754
on the facility of Enola Vale.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.797
Any questions?

05:15.965 --> 05:17.216
Excellent.

05:22.555 --> 05:24.640
You're 30 minutes late again.
What's your excuse this time?

05:24.807 --> 05:26.642
- Did I miss something?
- That's not the point.

05:26.809 --> 05:29.144
You're late and it's becoming
an ongoing habit.

05:29.312 --> 05:31.730
- Were they prepped on the basics?
- I just did that.

05:31.898 --> 05:33.398
Good. Perfect timing.

05:34.317 --> 05:36.568
Well, what fresh hellions
are these?

05:39.739 --> 05:41.198
Angel.

05:44.619 --> 05:45.661
Davis.

05:45.828 --> 05:47.246
Guilty as charged.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.206
Yeah, well, do me a favor,
sunshine.

05:49.374 --> 05:50.415
Yank the pants up.

05:50.583 --> 05:52.292
There's no gangster wannabes
on my unit.

05:55.046 --> 05:56.213
Butch.

06:01.344 --> 06:03.595
Gentlemen,
pick up your belongings.

06:03.763 --> 06:04.846
Single file.

06:19.445 --> 06:21.280
Where are you two mutts
coming from?

06:21.447 --> 06:24.032
We just finished
Social Studies class, Mr. G.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.909
- And where are you going?
- Going to the library.

06:26.077 --> 06:27.494
I'm gone the weekend,
I come back,

06:27.662 --> 06:29.454
and you're in Special Unit.
What happened?

06:29.622 --> 06:30.747
- Nothing.
- What you do?

06:30.915 --> 06:32.082
I didn't do nothing.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.459
No, you didn't do anything.
And that makes sense.

06:34.627 --> 06:37.170
They throw you in the hole
for two days for not doing nothing.

06:37.338 --> 06:40.465
Why are you bothering him?
He told you he didn't do anything.

06:41.342 --> 06:44.011
- What, are you his lawyer?
- No.

06:44.178 --> 06:45.929
I'm a judge.

06:47.098 --> 06:49.725
- Pull your pants up and move on.
- All right, Mr. G.

06:49.892 --> 06:52.853
Like to see you out of that costume
by the end of the week too.

06:55.982 --> 06:56.982
Let's go.

07:06.492 --> 07:09.369
Butch, bed on the far left.
Davis, straight ahead.

07:09.537 --> 07:10.662
Angel, right here.

07:11.414 --> 07:13.415
Stow your gear and come over here
and line up.

07:17.712 --> 07:19.796
Listen carefully.
This is a new day for you gentlemen.

07:20.590 --> 07:23.633
No one in here cares about any felonies
you may have committed in the past.

07:23.801 --> 07:25.594
The judge may have given you
a sentence,

07:25.762 --> 07:28.096
but in reality, your sentence
all depends on your behavior.

07:28.264 --> 07:29.848
You show some good will
towards change

07:30.016 --> 07:32.392
and you get an earlier parole hearing
with the judge.

07:32.685 --> 07:34.353
Am I boring you, sunshine?

07:36.522 --> 07:37.814
No, sir.

07:37.982 --> 07:38.940
Good.

07:39.108 --> 07:42.361
'Cause I read your report
and you should be listening the closest.

07:43.905 --> 07:45.489
Right now, you're all Level 1.

07:45.782 --> 07:46.907
Evaluations will determine for us

07:47.075 --> 07:49.743
whether you actually want to change
and rehabilitate.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.330
Show us some improvements
and you can move to Level 2

07:53.498 --> 07:54.915
and become a trustee.

07:55.541 --> 07:56.500
You'll notice these gentlemen

07:56.667 --> 07:58.960
by their sports black pants
and their polo shirts.

07:59.253 --> 08:02.089
They've acknowledged they've made
some poor choices in life,

08:02.340 --> 08:03.924
but they've proven to staff,

08:04.092 --> 08:05.634
and more importantly
to themselves,

08:06.094 --> 08:08.345
that they're ready to re-enter society
with the necessary skills

08:08.513 --> 08:11.139
to avoid further criminal behavior.

08:11.808 --> 08:14.476
Becoming a trustee
comes with a lot of privileges.

08:14.644 --> 08:16.269
But if you mess up,

08:16.437 --> 08:20.440
if you try any crazy stuff
on anybody in here or yourself

08:21.109 --> 08:23.568
or you try to bust out,
well, congratulations.

08:23.736 --> 08:26.988
You just won an orange suit
and a free trip to Special Unit.

08:29.951 --> 08:32.159
So, gentlemen,
make your stay pleasant here

08:32.328 --> 08:34.162
by being good to yourself,

08:34.664 --> 08:38.457
your peers and the staff,
and I guarantee you'll be all right.

08:39.919 --> 08:40.961
All right, unpack.

08:49.804 --> 08:52.222
Good, boys.
Hot bowl of shit coming right up.

08:52.390 --> 08:54.474
- You stinkin' like shit.
- No, I don't.

08:56.978 --> 08:58.728
Thanks, partner.

08:58.896 --> 09:01.815
Do some dishes
or something, Loony. Fuck!

09:01.983 --> 09:03.483
Fuck your dishes!

09:04.861 --> 09:06.445
Loony, he thinks he's...

09:23.004 --> 09:24.171
No.

09:24.839 --> 09:26.840
Hurry up.
Keep it moving.

09:34.599 --> 09:35.932
Is this seat taken?

09:46.486 --> 09:48.403
Somebody get clumsy
with the ladle?

09:50.615 --> 09:51.781
Don't move on it, man.

09:51.949 --> 09:54.493
You'll just end up in the hole
where that asshole Banks wants you.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.206
The best thing...

10:00.625 --> 10:02.209
just pay no mind.

10:02.376 --> 10:04.419
Eventually, they'll
leave you alone like they did me.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.925
I mean, that was also
because I have AIDS.

10:16.974 --> 10:19.226
You know, we all know
why you're in here,

10:19.393 --> 10:20.644
especially Banks.

11:12.321 --> 11:13.905
You like that one, huh?

11:15.241 --> 11:16.741
It's pretty cool.

11:18.119 --> 11:20.787
It's for all the virgins
I corrupted, man.

11:44.645 --> 11:46.563
Yo, drop it and flush it!

11:46.731 --> 11:48.023
Don't worry 'bout it.

11:50.109 --> 11:51.568
What the fuck?

11:51.736 --> 11:54.112
- Throw me back my toothpaste, man.
- Fuck you! Get it yourself!

11:57.241 --> 11:58.992
Fucking prairie nigger.

12:00.077 --> 12:01.453
Sal!
- What?

12:01.621 --> 12:02.746
Come here.

12:02.913 --> 12:05.081
All right, gentlemen.
Let's settle down.

12:05.249 --> 12:07.042
Sal, get back in your bed.

12:10.046 --> 12:11.630
Good night, gentlemen.

13:15.778 --> 13:18.613
- Hey, Goodyear.
- Morning. How was the night?

13:18.781 --> 13:19.989
No problems.

13:21.242 --> 13:24.160
Control, open gate B2, please.

13:27.164 --> 13:29.207
- Thank you, sir.
- Have a good day.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.500
You too.

13:44.974 --> 13:47.350
Control, open dormitory A1.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.022
Wakey, wakey!

13:53.190 --> 13:55.358
Hands off snaky! Let's go!

13:57.319 --> 13:58.236
Let's go, gentlemen.

13:58.404 --> 14:00.655
A two-minute window
to get the bed made.

14:04.827 --> 14:06.536
Ends of the bed when you're done.

14:08.456 --> 14:10.081
Let's go, guys.
Shake it off.

14:30.936 --> 14:33.730
Mr. Angel Ortiz,
grab your bucket and mop.

14:33.898 --> 14:34.981
Come with me.

14:52.541 --> 14:53.875
He's right here.

15:04.845 --> 15:06.095
What's up, man?

15:08.057 --> 15:09.682
How's it going, man?

15:09.850 --> 15:10.975
What's up?

15:11.143 --> 15:12.894
You just get here?
Yeah.

15:13.062 --> 15:14.020
Yeah, that's cool.

15:14.188 --> 15:15.688
How much time did you get?

15:15.856 --> 15:17.690
- Three months, man.
- Oh!

15:17.858 --> 15:19.692
- Just three?
- Just three.

15:19.860 --> 15:21.653
- Shit!
- That ain't shit, cuz.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.780
You know, I just did
three months fucking three times.

15:23.948 --> 15:27.242
I could do that on my fucking head
in the hole. You know what I mean?

15:27.409 --> 15:30.495
Yeah. Yeah.
So how long you got, man?

15:31.747 --> 15:33.331
What do you mean,
how long I got?

15:33.833 --> 15:35.750
Who the fuck's business is that, man?

15:35.918 --> 15:37.919
Just asking, man.
I don't know.

15:38.087 --> 15:40.880
Don't be asking no stupid
punk-ass questions around here.

15:41.590 --> 15:43.216
You'll go get yourself hurt, boy.

15:43.592 --> 15:44.843
Yeah, all right, man.

15:46.095 --> 15:48.471
- You looking to get fucked up?
- No, man.

15:48.639 --> 15:50.014
- Looking to get fucked up?
- Relax, relax!

15:50.182 --> 15:51.724
Huh? Looking to get fucked up?

15:54.019 --> 15:56.688
Just fucking with you, man.
This nigger's a bitch, cuz.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.732
- No, man.
- Brush it off. Calm down, man.

16:00.818 --> 16:02.193
Your boots, though, man...

16:03.279 --> 16:05.154
They're looking, uh,
pretty nice, man.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.365
Where did you get those at?

16:07.533 --> 16:08.950
- At the mall.
- At the mall?

16:09.118 --> 16:10.994
- Yeah.
- How much were they?

16:11.412 --> 16:13.538
They were, like,
I don't know, 100 bucks.

16:13.706 --> 16:16.457
Your mom give you those kicks
or something? A little present?

16:16.625 --> 16:17.709
- From mommy?
- No, man.

16:17.877 --> 16:18.877
No?

16:19.044 --> 16:21.045
- No, man. I bought these.
- You bought 'em?

16:21.213 --> 16:22.797
- Yeah.
- You a hustler, all right.

16:22.965 --> 16:23.965
Yeah.

16:24.258 --> 16:27.886
Fuck! Hustler hustlin'.
What size are you, 10? Big man?

16:28.053 --> 16:29.929
Let me check them boots out.
Cop 'em over.

16:30.097 --> 16:31.431
No, man. I'm only an 8.

16:31.599 --> 16:34.559
What the fuck you mean,
you is only an 8? Don't look like no 8!

16:34.727 --> 16:37.562
- You fucking lying to my boy?
- Don't look like a fucking 8 to me!

16:37.730 --> 16:39.022
All right, man.

16:40.858 --> 16:42.483
Come on, man.
Don't be a bitch, man.

16:45.487 --> 16:48.156
- They are nice-ass boots.
- Whoo-hee!

16:48.324 --> 16:50.825
Yeah. I lookin' fresh to death.
You feeling me?

16:50.993 --> 16:53.578
- Man, fresh as fuck.
- How am I looking, cuz?

16:53.746 --> 16:54.704
Nice. Nice, cuz.

16:54.872 --> 16:56.789
- How am I looking?
- They look good, man...

16:56.957 --> 16:58.166
They're nice-ass boots.

16:58.334 --> 17:01.377
- Can I have it back now?
- Just feeling it out. They're comfy.

17:01.545 --> 17:03.463
- Let me see that other one.
- Try that shit.

17:06.383 --> 17:07.884
I'm gonna try that.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.012
It's all good, man.
It's all good. You feeling me?

17:11.180 --> 17:13.598
Fuck, they're real nice, bro,
but fuck, too big for me, man.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.059
Let me check that.
Let me try both of them on at once.

17:16.226 --> 17:17.852
Now that they're on my feet,

17:18.020 --> 17:20.813
I don't really feel like
taking them off.

17:20.981 --> 17:23.148
They're too comfy. Plus, I'm fresh.
You know what I mean?

17:23.317 --> 17:25.777
Some boots right there,
they ain't tricking. They're nice.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.945
Don't take no offence,
you know what I mean?

17:28.113 --> 17:29.447
Let's peace-out of here, boys.

17:31.033 --> 17:32.408
Fucking bitch.

17:37.665 --> 17:39.791
Fuck!

17:53.430 --> 17:54.847
Wake up.

17:55.015 --> 17:56.933
The floor's not gonna mop itself.

18:18.789 --> 18:20.206
Let's do it.

18:22.459 --> 18:24.836
Faggot.

18:26.588 --> 18:27.797
Fucking bitch.

18:27.965 --> 18:30.008
You got him-
Butch!

18:30.175 --> 18:33.011
What did I just say to you?
Get back to work.

18:51.238 --> 18:52.447
What's up, Shadow?

19:00.247 --> 19:02.248
Wipe that smile off.

19:03.167 --> 19:05.251
That's it, boys.

19:05.419 --> 19:07.670
Let's get this shit cleaned up.

19:44.333 --> 19:47.835
Loony.
Get the fuck up, man.

19:49.421 --> 19:50.713
Get the fuck up.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.514
Get the fuck up, man.

20:05.979 --> 20:09.023
Loony. You go first.

20:29.461 --> 20:31.963
What the fuck you doing, man?
Not in the face, nigger!

20:32.131 --> 20:34.048
Shut up, man!

20:34.216 --> 20:36.843
I swear to God,
if you fucking rat, man,

20:37.010 --> 20:40.138
I'll kill you my fucking self, man.
You feel me?

21:07.457 --> 21:09.458
Time's up.
Get in front of your bunks.

21:09.626 --> 21:10.835
Ready for inspection.

21:28.979 --> 21:30.521
You call this making a bed?

21:31.523 --> 21:33.900
Whatever. Fuck.

21:37.362 --> 21:39.363
Why the fuck did you do that?

21:40.407 --> 21:42.200
You better learn to control
your mouth, kid.

21:44.328 --> 21:46.037
I'm gonna mess it up tonight
anyways.

21:46.205 --> 21:47.246
Fuck, like...

21:47.414 --> 21:51.334
You are on solitary report
by supper.

21:52.127 --> 21:55.213
Now make your bed properly.

22:05.390 --> 22:07.433
Stand up straight, Frank.

22:16.401 --> 22:18.778
All right, boys.
Let's go. Wash up.

22:18.946 --> 22:21.739
Come on! Move it!

22:23.283 --> 22:24.533
Let's go.

22:25.494 --> 22:26.702
You stay put.

22:31.917 --> 22:35.294
That looks kind of painful.
Wanna tell me what happened?

22:37.297 --> 22:38.506
I slipped and fell.

22:42.552 --> 22:44.512
Do I look like an asshole to you?

22:48.225 --> 22:50.309
Well, fortunately for us,
we have some procedures in place.

22:51.436 --> 22:53.562
You and I are gonna issue a report.

22:53.730 --> 22:55.231
And what good would that do?

22:55.399 --> 22:58.859
I just told you I slipped
and fell in the dark.

22:59.027 --> 23:01.028
- In the dark?
- Yeah.

23:01.405 --> 23:05.992
Well, maybe a few days in solitary,
you'll come up with a few more details.

23:06.451 --> 23:07.368
Maybe.

23:09.913 --> 23:11.163
Can I go?

23:12.291 --> 23:14.000
Yeah, you can go.

23:19.381 --> 23:21.173
Don't slip.

23:59.546 --> 24:03.174
- Fuck you, Banks!
- Banks, knock it off!

24:05.552 --> 24:07.970
Control, open gates B1.

24:30.702 --> 24:32.620
All right, I want two lines!

24:32.788 --> 24:34.955
Side by side in front of the dirt.
Line 'em up.

24:49.262 --> 24:50.304
Banks!

24:59.189 --> 25:01.649
How are you, son?
Sir, how are you?

25:01.817 --> 25:03.275
You doing a good job?

25:03.443 --> 25:05.611
I've been out of the dirt
for a while now.

25:05.779 --> 25:08.781
...an interview with construction
after this.

25:08.949 --> 25:10.449
Yeah, I'd like that.

25:16.289 --> 25:18.624
Aw!

25:24.047 --> 25:25.089
Max!

25:26.299 --> 25:28.050
Can you at least pretend
that you're working?

25:41.106 --> 25:43.399
Kill it, Banks. Shut it down.

25:47.237 --> 25:48.362
Lunch!

25:53.535 --> 25:55.661
Goodyear.
Move.

26:11.178 --> 26:12.470
Sit straight.

26:15.932 --> 26:18.434
You were transferred
to Enola Vale

26:18.602 --> 26:21.228
because you assaulted
a correctional officer.

26:22.063 --> 26:24.607
Not 24 hours inside,
you wake up all bruised up.

26:26.568 --> 26:30.613
I'm going to ask you for the last time:
what happened?

26:31.531 --> 26:33.574
I slipped and fell.

26:33.700 --> 26:35.743
Butch, I know you're not gonna rat,

26:35.911 --> 26:38.287
but our concern is
for your personal safety.

26:38.455 --> 26:41.332
Look, I am not your punishment.

26:42.959 --> 26:47.588
But if you refuse to cooperate,
I have no choice but to isolate you.

26:48.089 --> 26:49.089
Okay.

26:51.551 --> 26:53.636
Goodyear, get him out of here.

27:06.942 --> 27:08.442
Come on in.

27:17.661 --> 27:19.578
Hurry up, Max.
I don't have all day.

27:20.664 --> 27:22.414
What's the rush,
Miss Biggs?

27:26.211 --> 27:28.796
So, what is it today, Max?
Is it about your HIV test?

27:28.964 --> 27:32.007
Don't worry, it's negative,
you can stop spreading those rumors.

27:34.636 --> 27:36.053
No, the truth is...

27:36.221 --> 27:39.431
I've fallen deeply in love
with a woman

27:39.599 --> 27:41.600
and I just...
I don't know how to tell her.

27:41.768 --> 27:43.310
Well, I can't help you with that.

27:43.478 --> 27:45.312
Maybe Sands can give you
some good advice.

27:45.855 --> 27:48.065
You know, I wanna tell her
so many things.

27:48.233 --> 27:49.817
I got so much inside,
I just wanna...

27:51.152 --> 27:52.528
I just...

27:52.696 --> 27:54.738
You know, I wrote her a poem,
because, you know,

27:54.906 --> 27:57.491
poetry is really the only way
I can truly express myself.

27:57.659 --> 27:58.742
Can I read it to you?

28:02.664 --> 28:04.456
"She's a caretaker,

28:04.624 --> 28:07.710
"but there's no one
to take care of her.

28:08.712 --> 28:10.129
"She listens to others

28:10.297 --> 28:12.965
"to avoid listening to her. "

28:13.133 --> 28:15.050
That part doesn't rhyme.
It's just an early draft, though.

28:15.218 --> 28:18.137
"In a world surrounded by men,
I am her only admirer.

28:18.305 --> 28:19.638
"The clock is ticking,
she's getting older,

28:19.806 --> 28:21.432
"but still no rock on the finger-"

28:21.600 --> 28:23.142
Max, I get the point.

28:23.310 --> 28:25.603
I got a lot of work here.
I think you should go.

28:26.730 --> 28:29.565
Miss Biggs,
I am seriously offended here.

28:29.733 --> 28:32.818
I don't know if you know this,
but when it comes to creativity,

28:32.986 --> 28:35.529
a subject us artists
are particularly sensitive to,

28:35.697 --> 28:38.490
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't interrupt me again.

28:40.827 --> 28:41.994
Fine.

28:43.830 --> 28:47.041
"I dream she's...

28:47.208 --> 28:49.168
"lying naked on fur,
glistening crotch

28:49.336 --> 28:50.544
tickled by her pinkie finger. "

28:50.712 --> 28:53.213
Enough Max!
Get out of here now!

28:54.424 --> 28:55.924
You don't get it.

28:56.092 --> 28:58.302
You crossed the line big time.
Get out now.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.471
Since one of us
doesn't see the value in art,

29:00.639 --> 29:02.014
there won't be a next time.

29:13.735 --> 29:15.903
You probably thought
I was alluding to you in that poem.

29:16.071 --> 29:18.405
Uh, I wasn't,
so sorry to disappoint.

29:18.573 --> 29:19.907
And have a good day.

29:21.034 --> 29:22.493
Davis.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.789
You know, man,
when you first come here and shit,

29:26.956 --> 29:28.582
boys thought you was a bitch.

29:28.750 --> 29:30.584
At least you ain't rat
on nobody, man.

29:30.752 --> 29:32.419
So, you know, we're all straight?

29:32.587 --> 29:35.339
- Cool.
- Everything's all right, man.

29:35.507 --> 29:36.507
Thanks, man.

29:37.384 --> 29:40.928
What the fuck is it
you've got on going down there?

29:41.096 --> 29:43.472
Pissin' sweat out your armpits, man!

29:43.640 --> 29:45.724
Yeah, man, I need to change
my shirt or some shit.

29:45.892 --> 29:47.226
What the fuck's wrong
with you, man?

29:47.394 --> 29:49.645
Why you always walking 'round here
all worried and shit, man?

29:49.813 --> 29:51.647
You ain't gotta be scared.
You scared?

29:51.815 --> 29:55.150
- No, man. I'm not scared.
- You ain't got no reason to be scared.

29:55.318 --> 29:56.902
You know what I mean, player?

29:57.070 --> 29:58.487
- Yeah.
- Everything's all good.

29:58.655 --> 29:59.905
Hustlers ain't scared of shit.

30:00.073 --> 30:01.281
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:01.449 --> 30:02.991
- You is a hustler, right?
- Yeah.

30:03.159 --> 30:05.494
What you hustlin'?
So you hustlin' some weed and shit?

30:05.662 --> 30:06.662
No, man. Pills and coke.

30:06.830 --> 30:08.580
- You hustle that "yay"?
- Yeah.

30:08.748 --> 30:10.999
Movin' that "yayo"?
You like that raw shit?

30:11.167 --> 30:12.626
- Yeah.
- You like that shit?

30:12.794 --> 30:14.169
Mm-hmm.

30:14.337 --> 30:17.214
Yeah, so, uh, what if I had
some of that raw shit, man?

30:17.382 --> 30:18.757
You want a bump?

30:18.925 --> 30:20.634
What, you have some of that?

30:20.802 --> 30:21.802
Yo, Loony.

30:21.970 --> 30:24.388
Get that white shit out
for the pretty boy, man.

30:24.556 --> 30:26.014
He wanna get fucked up.

30:26.182 --> 30:27.766
All right. See you later.

30:27.934 --> 30:29.685
Hey, what the fuck
you doing in here?

30:29.853 --> 30:33.313
We're doing some big-man business.
Get the fuck out of here!

30:35.024 --> 30:37.735
Nice throw, you fucking faggot!
I'm gonna cut you up right now, bitch,

30:37.902 --> 30:39.820
and all your little bitches
are gonna see.

30:39.988 --> 30:42.239
- Are you shitting me, Sal?
- Yo, fuck you!

30:45.368 --> 30:47.578
Suck on my nuts, mutt!

30:47.746 --> 30:49.621
You got that white shit
for me Loony?

30:54.169 --> 30:56.962
Cut you a six, man.
Don't even worry about it.

31:01.092 --> 31:02.593
It's all straight.

31:04.929 --> 31:07.806
Get that into you, man.
That's some good.

31:09.934 --> 31:12.686
Oh, shit!

31:12.854 --> 31:14.480
How you like that, man?

31:14.647 --> 31:16.440
Is that good shit?

31:16.608 --> 31:17.691
It's different.

31:17.859 --> 31:20.611
Yeah, that's just 'cause it's pure.
Don't worry about it.

31:42.133 --> 31:46.303
Shhh! Just be quiet, man.
Shhh! Be quiet.

31:46.846 --> 31:48.639
- Yeah.
- Just be easy.

31:48.807 --> 31:50.682
Everything's okay, man.

31:50.850 --> 31:53.811
- Yeah.
- You're just tripping.

31:53.978 --> 31:55.854
- Yeah.
- It's all good.

31:56.022 --> 31:58.357
- Yeah.
- Shhh!

31:59.734 --> 32:01.276
You feel good, man.

32:01.444 --> 32:04.988
It is the best feeling ever, man.

32:05.573 --> 32:07.115
Deep into your hole, man.

32:08.618 --> 32:12.287
You feel so good.
You're gonna be fine.

32:12.455 --> 32:13.747
You love being fucked up.

32:13.915 --> 32:14.915
No.

32:19.087 --> 32:20.170
What?

32:20.338 --> 32:21.839
What you guys give me?

32:22.006 --> 32:22.923
Shhh!

32:23.091 --> 32:24.758
Just some special medicine, man.

32:24.926 --> 32:27.553
Just the good medicine.

32:27.720 --> 32:29.137
You love it, man.

32:29.305 --> 32:31.932
You feel good, dog.

32:32.100 --> 32:34.643
Oh, look at these!

32:34.811 --> 32:36.270
That's the good shit, man.

32:36.437 --> 32:37.813
Don't wake up.

32:37.981 --> 32:39.773
Just go to sleep.

32:39.941 --> 32:42.776
Hey, is that your mom
and your sister in this photo?

32:43.486 --> 32:45.779
Damn, that bitch is fine!

32:46.155 --> 32:48.782
Tell that bitch to come see me
next visiting day, man.

32:48.950 --> 32:49.992
I'll beat that pussy up.

32:51.452 --> 32:54.413
Yeah, you know,
your mom was just here.

32:54.581 --> 32:55.497
Yeah, man.

32:55.665 --> 32:58.792
You know,
she left happier than she came.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.920
I'm so sad she left.
I miss her already.

33:02.714 --> 33:05.632
Yeah, you know,
she was sad when she was here.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.092
No.

33:07.260 --> 33:09.720
- She was looking for you.
- You missed her.

33:09.888 --> 33:11.638
But she found me.

33:11.806 --> 33:14.683
- No!
- You know, she was so beautiful.

33:16.019 --> 33:17.686
She wants me.

33:19.230 --> 33:20.772
You know,
your mom loves me.

33:20.940 --> 33:21.982
No.

33:22.150 --> 33:24.902
Your mom calls me Daddy.
NO!

33:25.069 --> 33:27.279
Shut up, man.
Shut the fuck up.

33:27.447 --> 33:28.697
Where is she? Mom!

33:28.865 --> 33:30.949
Shut up, man!
He's a fucking heat bag.

33:31.117 --> 33:32.993
Fuck it. Let's go.
Let's go, man.

33:33.161 --> 33:35.495
Fucking too much.

33:58.478 --> 33:59.978
Help...

34:02.523 --> 34:04.232
Help!

34:09.072 --> 34:10.072
Help!

34:13.784 --> 34:15.327
- Get on your feet, boy.
- I can't.

34:15.495 --> 34:17.454
- Come on, get up.
- No.

34:17.621 --> 34:18.914
Come on, boy.
Get on your feet.

34:20.166 --> 34:21.208
Come on.

34:24.170 --> 34:25.212
Come on.

34:36.975 --> 34:38.684
Stand here.
Don't move.

34:38.851 --> 34:40.851
Oh! Oh!

34:51.989 --> 34:53.114
Come here.

34:53.866 --> 34:54.866
Swallow.

35:21.769 --> 35:23.478
Solitary Control.

35:24.480 --> 35:25.939
Unlock 7.

35:34.449 --> 35:36.575
This is not a punishment.
It's for your own good.

35:36.743 --> 35:39.578
Try to drink lots of water
to flush that shit out of your system.

36:04.645 --> 36:08.815
I wait along the borders of disdain

36:11.652 --> 36:13.153
Staring in

36:13.321 --> 36:14.571
Open your mouth.

36:15.364 --> 36:16.573
What I would give

36:16.741 --> 36:19.493
To be within your arms

36:20.078 --> 36:21.286
Thank you.

36:21.454 --> 36:23.747
Dry and warm

36:26.751 --> 36:29.419
- Where's the file, eh? Come on. Oh!
- Stop it.

36:29.587 --> 36:31.922
- Where's those files that you stole?
- Stop it.

36:32.090 --> 36:36.134
Give me the scent of free

36:36.302 --> 36:39.763
Syringa tree

36:41.641 --> 36:44.226
It's final call

36:47.605 --> 36:51.066
Lonely voice upon a mountaintop

36:53.277 --> 36:55.070
Shouting out

36:58.157 --> 37:01.243
The secrets of a generation told

37:03.704 --> 37:06.164
All the lies

37:09.585 --> 37:13.296
Blind and riding
on the ocean's spine

37:14.215 --> 37:15.632
No fault of mine

37:15.800 --> 37:16.967
Davis.

37:19.595 --> 37:23.140
Drowning is what I've perfected for

37:24.392 --> 37:25.725
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

37:25.893 --> 37:27.227
All my life

37:27.812 --> 37:29.437
Hasty!

37:29.605 --> 37:30.689
What happened here?

37:33.109 --> 37:34.067
Getting a little rough.

37:34.235 --> 37:36.111
No, man, I can't wait
to dig up ditches again tomorrow.

37:36.988 --> 37:39.030
- I don't care.
- Should be a good time.

37:39.198 --> 37:41.408
- That's all he cares about.
- Wishful thoughts, eh?

37:41.742 --> 37:45.412
Banks, let's go.
Good night, gentlemen.

37:51.377 --> 37:52.586
Give me

37:54.338 --> 37:56.673
The scent of free

37:56.841 --> 37:59.009
Syringa tree

37:59.886 --> 38:02.387
Crowning me

38:02.555 --> 38:03.972
My victory march

38:04.849 --> 38:07.434
The marble arch

38:07.602 --> 38:10.145
Trumpet horn

38:10.313 --> 38:12.606
It's final call

38:30.166 --> 38:31.541
All right, boys.

38:31.709 --> 38:33.210
Go back to the dorms,

38:33.377 --> 38:35.545
wash up, change your clothes.

38:36.339 --> 38:37.964
Move out.

39:16.170 --> 39:17.587
Yo, faggot,
throw the ball back.

39:20.633 --> 39:22.676
Yo, I'm talking to you, faggot!

39:27.306 --> 39:28.932
Look, fuck you, man,
all right?

39:29.100 --> 39:30.642
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

39:31.686 --> 39:34.312
You want me to fuck you up,
faggot?

39:35.439 --> 39:37.607
Got your friend here.
What are you-

39:40.695 --> 39:42.112
Ow!

39:45.908 --> 39:48.285
You get the fuck back!
Where the fuck's Banks?

39:48.452 --> 39:50.036
- He's upstairs.
- Thank you.

39:50.204 --> 39:51.496
Let's go.

40:13.311 --> 40:14.311
Let's go.

40:25.031 --> 40:26.239
Keep watch.

40:26.407 --> 40:27.741
All right.

41:05.488 --> 41:06.905
Davis!

41:09.492 --> 41:11.117
Get rid of it.

41:19.794 --> 41:22.212
-10-99, rec room.
What the hell happened here?

41:22.380 --> 41:24.422
On your belly.
Arms by your side.

41:29.553 --> 41:30.762
Who did this to you?

41:37.144 --> 41:38.478
Who did this to him?

41:38.646 --> 41:40.105
Don't know.

41:46.237 --> 41:47.779
Sands to Control.

41:48.781 --> 41:51.408
10-66, lavatory, dorm A.

41:53.160 --> 41:55.787
Get to the end of the bed,
both of you, now.

42:00.209 --> 42:01.418
What did I say to you?

42:02.461 --> 42:05.171
I said no retaliation,
you fucking moron!

42:05.339 --> 42:07.048
What are you talking about?

42:07.216 --> 42:09.092
You really do think I'm stupid,
don't you?

42:09.260 --> 42:10.468
No, I don't.

42:10.636 --> 42:13.555
You think you're the first tough guy
to walk through these halls?

42:14.515 --> 42:17.559
Think you're the first guy to ever lay
a beat down on somebody?

42:18.936 --> 42:20.270
Probably not.

42:20.438 --> 42:23.940
Well, I know I'm not your first CO,
so let's go, you and me.

42:27.319 --> 42:29.154
Yo, he didn't fucking do anything.
Chill!

42:29.321 --> 42:31.448
- Shut your mouth.
- Don't do that again.

42:31.615 --> 42:33.283
Don't do what again?

42:33.868 --> 42:36.536
- Don't fucking do that again.
- Come on, let's go.

42:39.457 --> 42:40.874
Come on. Throw down.

43:06.066 --> 43:07.775
Oh! Baby!

43:08.777 --> 43:11.029
Oh, my sweetie.
Okay, Mom.

43:17.870 --> 43:20.205
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

43:21.207 --> 43:24.459
- Are the kids still picking on you?
- No one's picking on me, Mom.

43:24.627 --> 43:26.669
I took care of that on my own,
all right?

43:26.837 --> 43:30.465
Baby, I'm taking care of it.
I filed a suit against this institution.

43:30.633 --> 43:33.218
Why the fuck
would you do that, Mom?

43:34.678 --> 43:36.513
Baby, I called Uncle Conrad,

43:36.680 --> 43:38.973
and he has put me in touch
with a top lawyer.

43:41.060 --> 43:43.811
So what can I tell the lawyer?
When can he come and visit you?

43:43.979 --> 43:45.688
You can tell him to go fuck himself.

43:46.607 --> 43:47.732
Davis.

43:47.900 --> 43:49.484
I gotta go, Mom.

43:49.652 --> 43:51.319
No, sweetie.
Let me help you.

43:51.487 --> 43:52.695
No.

43:58.744 --> 44:00.370
Remove the hat, please.

44:23.644 --> 44:25.853
It's good.

44:26.730 --> 44:29.107
Ah! That's...

44:29.942 --> 44:32.819
And your family is missing you, huh?

44:37.783 --> 44:40.451
You keep on saying that.

44:40.619 --> 44:42.495
You keep on saying that.
Whatever.

44:42.663 --> 44:44.497
You guys aren't doing anything, so...

45:03.767 --> 45:04.726
Boys!

45:24.705 --> 45:26.497
...they had the door unlocked.

45:26.665 --> 45:28.708
We opened it up
and it was just sitting there.

45:28.876 --> 45:31.294
It was just sitting there.

45:31.462 --> 45:33.796
It was just like... like...
Watch this right here.

45:33.964 --> 45:35.465
Just fucking sitting there...

45:41.764 --> 45:45.350
- Hey, give me your bread!
- There's this special school...

46:18.342 --> 46:19.801
Hey, yo, are you Butch?

46:21.053 --> 46:22.637
Who wants to know?

46:22.805 --> 46:25.056
This nigger Shadow
wants to talk to you.

46:26.058 --> 46:27.684
For what?

46:29.186 --> 46:30.770
Don't know.

46:43.409 --> 46:45.410
Harrel, could you please
close the door?

46:54.920 --> 46:56.629
It's nice to see everyone here.

46:57.715 --> 46:59.841
Let's start by grading the day.

47:00.008 --> 47:01.676
Who wants to go first?

47:05.139 --> 47:06.681
Okay, I'll go first.

47:06.849 --> 47:09.559
For me, today is a 6...

47:09.727 --> 47:11.728
because this morning

47:11.895 --> 47:15.022
I lost my temper in traffic
with a jerk at a red light.

47:16.024 --> 47:17.525
Butch?

47:17.693 --> 47:20.486
- Seven.
- You wanna tell us why?

47:20.654 --> 47:22.697
Just got out
of the fucking hole today.

47:22.865 --> 47:26.075
- Good.
- Zero.

47:27.870 --> 47:29.579
Do you want to tell us why?

47:32.833 --> 47:34.208
No.

47:34.376 --> 47:36.919
Frank, you've been at zero now
for months.

47:37.087 --> 47:40.256
Is there nothing that's positive?

47:42.342 --> 47:43.551
No.

47:43.719 --> 47:46.471
Okay, we can talk
about that later.

47:47.931 --> 47:50.057
Harrel, can you read
what we're talking about today?

47:50.225 --> 47:54.812
"Evaluating and rel... re-label... "

47:58.025 --> 48:00.067
- Shut up, man.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

48:00.235 --> 48:01.569
I'll read it.

48:01.737 --> 48:03.279
"Anger and aggression. "

48:03.447 --> 48:06.949
I think we all realize
that everybody feels anger,

48:07.117 --> 48:09.911
but not everybody can control it,

48:10.078 --> 48:12.747
which is why
you guys are here today.

48:12.915 --> 48:16.918
So anger is a good thing
if you can control it,

48:17.085 --> 48:20.755
but it's a definite disadvantage
if you can't control it.

48:20.923 --> 48:23.841
So, let's start by talking
about what makes us angry.

48:24.009 --> 48:25.802
Harrel, what makes you angry?

48:25.969 --> 48:29.263
That I'm not next to you at night,
Miss Biggs.

48:29.431 --> 48:30.556
Harrel, that's enough.

48:30.599 --> 48:33.684
What kind of ass-ugly nigger like you
would want to get a girl like her?

48:33.852 --> 48:35.436
Don't fucking call me no nigger!

48:35.604 --> 48:37.271
Thank you, gentlemen,
for going down.

48:37.439 --> 48:39.690
- What's wrong with you?
- Frank, what about you?

48:39.858 --> 48:41.400
What makes you angry?

48:42.402 --> 48:43.611
Fat people.

48:43.779 --> 48:46.656
They walk slowly in the middle
of the hallway.

48:46.824 --> 48:50.117
They're always sweating,
farting, funking up the dorm.

48:50.285 --> 48:53.037
Takes them an hour for them
to drop fat,

48:53.205 --> 48:54.956
anaconda shits
while I'm face-to-face with them

48:55.123 --> 48:58.042
trying to wash my face
or brush my motherfucking teeth.

48:58.210 --> 49:00.628
- That's a lot of f-words.
- Blame your mom.

49:02.422 --> 49:03.381
My mom?

49:03.549 --> 49:06.175
For giving you the big-ass nostrils
that look like sunglasses, son.

49:06.343 --> 49:08.678
This is a good example of-

49:08.846 --> 49:11.722
Every time we're talking,
you know what it really does?

49:11.890 --> 49:12.807
- What?
- It pisses me off.

49:12.975 --> 49:15.017
One day, I'm gonna get up
and snap your neck.

49:15.185 --> 49:18.145
- Move those lips so much.
- You wanna test me?

49:18.313 --> 49:19.814
- I'm right here!
- I'll break your neck.

49:19.982 --> 49:22.733
This is really-
You ain't making no moves.

49:22.901 --> 49:24.652
That's nothing. I'll show you.

49:24.820 --> 49:26.362
Sit!

49:26.530 --> 49:27.488
Boys, that's enough.

49:27.656 --> 49:30.491
- You wanna fucking do this?
- Frank, that's enough.

49:30.659 --> 49:32.660
- What are you gonna do?
- No touching! Break it up.

49:32.828 --> 49:35.371
Break it up!

49:35.539 --> 49:37.665
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Right now!

49:37.833 --> 49:39.166
Let's do this!
I'm right here!

49:39.334 --> 49:40.585
You wanna go?

49:40.752 --> 49:42.879
You wanna go?
Let's go!

49:43.046 --> 49:45.006
Emergency A-23.
Send me a CO now.

49:48.760 --> 49:50.928
I'll, uh... I'll come and see you
after the family visits.

49:51.096 --> 49:52.680
Okay, bro?

49:52.848 --> 49:53.973
Settle down!

49:57.019 --> 49:59.312
- Get off him!
- Stop it!

49:59.479 --> 50:00.855
Let go!

50:01.773 --> 50:04.609
- You want some, huh?
- Frank!

50:06.111 --> 50:07.361
Okay, take him!

50:07.529 --> 50:09.155
I got you, baby!

50:09.323 --> 50:11.532
You are done!
You hear that?

50:21.001 --> 50:23.628
Here. I gotta go.
The CO's waiting for me upstairs.

50:25.088 --> 50:26.547
Let me see the other guy's cut.

50:26.715 --> 50:28.049
What?

50:28.216 --> 50:30.051
Let me see the other guy's cut.

50:31.053 --> 50:32.845
Oh, here we go!

50:35.807 --> 50:38.059
Shadow paid for that.
He's expecting it.

50:38.226 --> 50:40.227
Turn around
and spread your legs.

50:40.395 --> 50:43.564
- There's a fucking CO waiting-
- Turn around and spread your legs.

50:45.817 --> 50:46.817
That's not how it works.

50:54.117 --> 50:56.452
I don't like sneaky people
doing sneaky shit behind my back.

50:56.620 --> 50:58.913
Don't know what you're talking about,
but we have a system here.

50:59.081 --> 51:02.041
Fuck your system.
Today is my way.

51:24.898 --> 51:26.440
What the hell?

51:27.401 --> 51:29.402
Fuck off with that shit, man!

51:29.569 --> 51:30.945
Fuck!

51:31.113 --> 51:32.780
Or tell us what you're thinkin'.

51:32.948 --> 51:34.615
Shit, man!
You just ruined it.

51:36.618 --> 51:38.786
- Tell us one of your lady stories, B.
- Good idea!

51:38.954 --> 51:40.496
Yeah, boy!
Yeah, yeah!

51:40.664 --> 51:44.000
- Yeah, man!
- Oh! All right.

51:44.167 --> 51:45.418
Make it good.

51:45.585 --> 51:47.962
So I'm sleeping over
at my girl's house, right?

51:48.422 --> 51:51.257
And she's on the rag,
so she just wants to go to sleep.

51:51.425 --> 51:53.509
I got the worst case
of blue balls, all right?

51:55.137 --> 51:57.179
Fuck that bitch, dog.
Fuck that bitch!

52:00.017 --> 52:02.893
So I... I just go downstairs
to the living room.

52:03.061 --> 52:04.478
I'm in my boxers.

52:04.646 --> 52:07.815
And chilling out, throw on the TV
and I just light up a "J".

52:13.447 --> 52:16.198
But then the front door opens.

52:16.366 --> 52:18.325
And who walks in?

52:18.493 --> 52:19.785
Her fucking mom!

52:19.953 --> 52:21.495
I think she's gonna
either bitch me out

52:21.663 --> 52:24.248
or make some small talk
and go off to bed, but no.

52:24.416 --> 52:26.167
She takes off her jacket.

52:26.334 --> 52:30.212
She's wearing this dress that makes
her titties just pop right out.

52:30.380 --> 52:33.174
And then she comes
and she sits right next to me.

52:33.842 --> 52:37.553
I don't know what the hell to say,
so I'm just trying to watch TV.

52:37.721 --> 52:41.057
But I could see out of the corner
of my eye that's she's looking at me.

52:41.224 --> 52:44.310
And then she says:
"Can I get a drag of that?"

52:45.771 --> 52:47.104
And I'm like: "Sure".

52:47.272 --> 52:49.398
So I'm watching her smoke this thing,

52:49.566 --> 52:51.609
and she's got these big,
juicy lips,

52:51.777 --> 52:54.111
and she's getting red lipstick
all over the tip of it.

52:54.279 --> 52:58.032
And she's blowing smoke in my face,
and I'm trying to concentrate on TV.

52:58.200 --> 52:59.742
But when she gives the spliff back,

52:59.910 --> 53:02.995
some ash falls right on my boxers.

53:03.163 --> 53:04.622
And before I can even do anything,

53:04.790 --> 53:08.793
she bends over and blows the ash off
with her mouth.

53:08.960 --> 53:10.878
And the bitch just sits back and says:

53:11.046 --> 53:12.963
"I'm gonna go to bed now. "

53:13.131 --> 53:16.050
I'm watching her go,
and before she gets to the doorway,

53:16.218 --> 53:18.928
she turns back and says:
"Good night, Davis. "

53:20.639 --> 53:23.224
You want that bitch!
You want that, white boy!

53:25.393 --> 53:27.978
So, what the fuck would you do?
What would you do?

53:28.146 --> 53:29.980
I knew I had to do something, right?

53:30.148 --> 53:31.982
I'm not a fucking idiot.
So I start...

53:32.150 --> 53:34.652
I start sneaking up the stairs
really slowly.

53:34.820 --> 53:37.530
And I walk into her room
really, really slowly.

53:37.697 --> 53:38.823
She can't hear me.

53:38.990 --> 53:40.783
And when I get there,

53:40.951 --> 53:43.035
she's just combing her hair
in her vanity mirror.

53:43.203 --> 53:46.413
And she's just, like,
looking all sultry, all sexy.

53:46.581 --> 53:49.041
And then when she notices me
standing there,

53:49.209 --> 53:50.376
what does she say?

53:51.753 --> 53:53.754
"Would you help me
with my zipper?"

53:59.177 --> 54:00.511
Mommy's naughty!

54:00.679 --> 54:03.180
- Damn, son!
- So now I'm fucking...

54:03.348 --> 54:05.558
Now I'm standing behind her, right?

54:05.725 --> 54:08.769
I'm standing behind her,
unzipping her dress,

54:08.937 --> 54:11.605
and she starts leaning forward
towards the mirror

54:11.773 --> 54:13.107
so she could see her face
closer in the mirror.

54:13.275 --> 54:16.652
And that means that her ass
is back up against my dick,

54:16.820 --> 54:18.028
like, brushing against me.

54:18.196 --> 54:21.157
And I don't know what the fuck
goes through my head,

54:21.324 --> 54:24.285
but I slap her ass and then I go:

54:24.452 --> 54:26.787
Lay back on the bed, bitch,
and open your legs.

54:26.955 --> 54:28.873
"What the fuck did you just say?"

54:29.040 --> 54:31.167
And then she grabs me
by the throat,

54:31.334 --> 54:32.960
throws me down
on that fucking bed,

54:33.128 --> 54:35.963
jumps on me
and starts sucking on my face, man.

54:37.966 --> 54:39.842
Yeah! Yeah!

54:41.052 --> 54:42.178
That's my boy!

54:49.811 --> 54:51.103
Whoa!

55:01.239 --> 55:05.242
Good morning, ladies!
Gather round the middle.

55:12.542 --> 55:14.460
Let's see how your team spirit
is this morning.

55:14.628 --> 55:16.629
We're gonna play a game
called dodge ball.

55:16.796 --> 55:18.839
Now mix up into two teams.

55:41.404 --> 55:43.280
We're not gonna have
any of this bullshit

55:43.448 --> 55:44.823
on my court this morning.

55:45.867 --> 55:48.118
You ain't no wiggers,
no niggers, no fucking crackers.

55:48.286 --> 55:50.412
I don't give a shit
what you think you is.

55:50.580 --> 55:54.124
You're a bunch of stray dogs
that got locked up in this dog pound

55:55.126 --> 55:56.418
and you all stink the same!

55:56.586 --> 55:58.170
Now mix this shit up!

56:01.967 --> 56:03.717
Sweat Marks,
get your ass over there now.

56:05.512 --> 56:08.639
Anybody else want my foot in their ass?
Now mix this shit up!

56:16.314 --> 56:18.190
My rules are simple.

56:18.775 --> 56:20.317
Strike your opponent with the ball.

56:20.485 --> 56:22.278
Dodge it, catch it

56:22.445 --> 56:24.947
and do not step on the line
or your team loses.

56:25.740 --> 56:27.074
Ready?

56:30.453 --> 56:33.038
On your mark... set...

56:42.465 --> 56:43.841
You're out!

56:45.719 --> 56:46.719
Come on!

56:49.431 --> 56:50.889
You're out, big boy!

56:52.434 --> 56:54.768
Come on, man. You're gone.

57:01.318 --> 57:03.861
This is your time
to get your aggression out.

57:04.029 --> 57:05.696
Now, brother!

57:05.864 --> 57:07.406
You're out! You're out.

57:08.199 --> 57:10.034
Let's go! Come on!

57:11.328 --> 57:13.287
- Come on!
- Get him!

57:13.455 --> 57:15.456
Come on!
Come on, take him out!

57:16.541 --> 57:17.624
Sweat Marks!

57:17.792 --> 57:19.460
Yeah, Sweat Marks!

57:19.627 --> 57:22.963
Sweat Marks! Sweat Marks!

57:23.131 --> 57:24.340
Oh!

57:24.507 --> 57:26.383
Sweat Marks!
Sweat Marks!

57:26.551 --> 57:27.718
One more!

57:27.886 --> 57:29.678
Sweat Marks!
Sweat Marks!

57:45.403 --> 57:47.654
Yeah!
You're my bitch now!

57:47.822 --> 57:49.823
Oh, shit!

57:51.493 --> 57:52.701
Yo, man,
what's in there?

57:52.869 --> 57:56.038
Sour OJ,
bread and a lot of sugar.

57:56.331 --> 57:58.457
Angel, was that your dad
that came to visit today?

57:58.625 --> 57:59.833
Yep.

58:00.001 --> 58:01.585
When's your mom gonna come?

58:03.713 --> 58:06.382
Man, I'll fucking slit your throat
if you go there.

58:06.549 --> 58:07.508
- What?
- Seriously.

58:07.675 --> 58:10.177
When's you mom gonna come.
Is she cute?

58:10.345 --> 58:12.096
I don't know, fuck.

58:12.263 --> 58:14.223
You can tell if a woman's pretty
even if it's your mom.

58:14.391 --> 58:16.683
- I dunno.
- Is she an attractive woman?

58:16.851 --> 58:17.893
She's my mom, man!

58:18.061 --> 58:20.687
Would you have sex with her
if you were not her son?

58:22.482 --> 58:24.400
- Uh-oh!
- Are you stupid?

58:24.567 --> 58:26.193
You gettin' at my neck, boy?

58:27.195 --> 58:28.695
What's this? What the fuck?

58:28.863 --> 58:30.406
What are you gonna do,
little man?

58:30.573 --> 58:33.033
Come on. Oh!
You fag!

58:33.284 --> 58:35.536
Fuck! All right! All right.

58:36.538 --> 58:37.871
Don't fucking kiss me,
you fucking fag!

58:38.039 --> 58:40.541
All right, dog. All right.

58:41.918 --> 58:44.294
- Thank you.
- Yo, why don't we talk about your mom?

58:45.588 --> 58:48.715
My mom's a cunt.
When I get out, I'm moving out.

58:48.883 --> 58:50.134
Don't worry about my mom.

58:50.301 --> 58:52.428
Perfect,
because when I get out of here,

58:53.388 --> 58:55.556
when you move,
I'm moving in.

58:55.974 --> 58:57.975
Into your mama's ass.

58:58.143 --> 59:00.227
Shut up, man! Shut up!

59:00.395 --> 59:02.104
What are you actually gonna do
when you get out, man?

59:02.730 --> 59:03.939
Uh, I wanna join the circus.

59:04.107 --> 59:06.108
Oh, yeah? Join the circus.

59:06.276 --> 59:08.235
Yeah, me too.
We'll all be in a clown costume.

59:08.403 --> 59:10.070
No, bro.
That's not funny, man.

59:10.238 --> 59:11.613
I'm serious.
Sure.

59:12.365 --> 59:13.824
My father was in the circus.

59:14.826 --> 59:16.452
He died when I was 10, man.

59:17.579 --> 59:20.497
He was doing a show
where he had to juggle some chainsaws,

59:20.665 --> 59:22.291
kind of like what I'm doing right now.

59:22.459 --> 59:24.209
But one of them fell out of his hand,

59:24.377 --> 59:26.462
and as it fell down,
it cut his cock right off.

59:34.262 --> 59:35.971
COs! COs!

59:42.770 --> 59:44.271
What are you guys doing?

59:46.024 --> 59:48.192
- Laundry.
- You haven't even started your chores.

59:48.359 --> 59:49.318
Well, on that happy note,

59:49.486 --> 59:51.111
you're all drawing extra work duty
on Sunday.

59:51.279 --> 59:52.863
Fuck!

59:53.031 --> 59:54.698
Butch, follow me.

01:00:34.447 --> 01:00:35.739
Sit down.

01:00:39.911 --> 01:00:42.079
What's your plan, son?

01:00:42.247 --> 01:00:43.747
My plan?

01:00:43.915 --> 01:00:46.667
I mean after all this,
incarceration.

01:00:49.295 --> 01:00:51.505
Well, I want to study
at a circus school.

01:00:51.673 --> 01:00:53.590
Are you being sarcastic?

01:00:54.926 --> 01:00:56.343
Not at all.

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:57.761
Hmm...

01:00:57.929 --> 01:01:00.472
The reason I'm asking you this
is because authorities

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.767
have investigated the officer
you blinded.

01:01:03.977 --> 01:01:06.853
More than 10 parties of legal guardians
have complained

01:01:07.021 --> 01:01:10.107
that their children
were physically abused by this man.

01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:13.735
I assume you acted in self-defense.

01:01:13.903 --> 01:01:15.571
To cut to the chase,
you have an opportunity here-

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:17.072
No, no, no.

01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:20.993
I took a careful look
at your report, son.

01:01:21.703 --> 01:01:24.580
If that incident with this officer
hadn't occurred,

01:01:25.456 --> 01:01:27.708
technically,
you'd be released this week.

01:01:27.875 --> 01:01:30.919
But in those next two weeks,
any misconduct on your part,

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:34.131
we withdraw the plea and it goes back
to the original charge,

01:01:34.299 --> 01:01:35.257
which is, as you know,

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:39.052
four years in an adult facility
starting the day you turn 19.

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:41.054
So with that in mind, son,

01:01:42.056 --> 01:01:44.141
I think you're responsible enough

01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:47.144
to make the right choices inside,

01:01:47.895 --> 01:01:49.855
and then in the outside world...

01:01:50.815 --> 01:01:52.441
hopefully,
in a circus school.

01:01:55.194 --> 01:01:56.862
Am I right?

01:01:59.324 --> 01:02:01.241
Yes, sir. Thank you.

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:05.287
Good. You can go.

01:02:20.261 --> 01:02:22.512
Where's my cheeseburger?

01:02:25.767 --> 01:02:27.559
Slow down, man.
You're gonna get some indigestion.

01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:30.729
You eating your nuggets?

01:02:30.897 --> 01:02:33.649
Yeah, I'm eating my nuggets.
I'm saving the best for last.

01:02:34.525 --> 01:02:35.776
Why the fuck would you do that?

01:02:37.528 --> 01:02:40.530
Eating's like making love, man.
It's a ritual, you know?

01:02:40.698 --> 01:02:42.157
You got your appetizer,

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:44.409
I sniff deeply into her scalp

01:02:44.577 --> 01:02:47.454
and grab onto her firm,
but voluptuous hips,

01:02:47.622 --> 01:02:49.581
nibble just ever so gently
on the earlobe.

01:02:49.749 --> 01:02:51.333
I mean, girls,
they go wild for that.

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:54.419
Why don't you skip the appetizer
and go straight to the main course?

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:55.921
Well, what's the main course?

01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:58.048
Main course:
you bust a nut, she bounces,

01:02:58.216 --> 01:02:59.716
play some video games,

01:02:59.884 --> 01:03:02.636
do whatever the fuck you want
and then you go to sleep.

01:03:04.097 --> 01:03:06.765
You're an animal, you know that?
You disgust me.

01:03:06.933 --> 01:03:09.101
For me, the entrée is,

01:03:09.268 --> 01:03:11.478
you know,
gentle circling the areola,

01:03:11.646 --> 01:03:13.980
kissing every notch of her spine,
lower and lower and lower

01:03:14.148 --> 01:03:16.400
until my tongue hovers
on her bellybutton.

01:03:16.567 --> 01:03:18.026
I take my time.

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:20.821
Yeah, you take so much time
that this girl's gonna be half asleep

01:03:20.988 --> 01:03:22.823
by the time you even get
to her cookie.

01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:25.701
Just like your food is getting all cold
and soggy now.

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:27.661
And you don't know
what food tastes like,

01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:30.956
'cause you wolf that shit down
like you haven't eaten in days.

01:03:31.124 --> 01:03:32.833
Come on!
These are women.

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:36.586
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Dude!

01:03:38.798 --> 01:03:40.382
No, no, man!
That's my protein!

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.717
You're hungry?

01:03:43.302 --> 01:03:44.803
I can't even get that nugget.
It's disgusting.

01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:48.306
Rebound. Rebound. You like that?
It was a rebound.

01:03:50.852 --> 01:03:52.769
Butch!
Come on, man!

01:03:52.937 --> 01:03:54.187
That was awesome!

01:03:54.355 --> 01:03:55.939
You know how old this spinach is?

01:03:56.107 --> 01:03:58.692
It's like, six-month-old spinach
on my face.

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:01.445
That was a sweet move.
You're a jerk, you know that?

01:04:01.612 --> 01:04:02.612
Oh!

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:03.864
Good job, bro.

01:04:05.032 --> 01:04:06.324
Oh! You like that?

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:09.494
I'm gonna kill you, man.
Don't do it again, please.

01:04:33.436 --> 01:04:35.479
Look at us.

01:04:35.646 --> 01:04:37.856
Look at us.
Okay, we need gloves for this.

01:04:38.024 --> 01:04:39.149
10-66...

01:04:39.317 --> 01:04:40.942
Did you see anyone?

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:42.527
Did you see anyone?

01:04:43.196 --> 01:04:44.196
Anyone see what happened?

01:04:44.363 --> 01:04:46.865
Sit back down.

01:04:49.118 --> 01:04:51.036
Nobody saw anything, huh?

01:04:52.497 --> 01:04:55.582
Simple.
Everyone's to blame.

01:04:57.835 --> 01:04:59.711
Greaves.

01:04:59.879 --> 01:05:01.922
What do you got?

01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:06.635
- I haven't found anything so far.
- Okay.

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:14.851
All right, get back in there,

01:05:15.019 --> 01:05:16.645
clean up that mess
and make your beds.

01:05:16.813 --> 01:05:18.897
Lights go out in five. Move.

01:05:24.612 --> 01:05:27.155
That's okay.
You just have to explain.

01:05:30.451 --> 01:05:32.953
Look, I gotta call you...
I'm... I gotta call you back.

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:37.666
The way we tossed the dorm
scared the hell out of them.

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:39.543
I don't think we're gonna have
any further problems.

01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:40.794
Let's hope so.

01:05:41.838 --> 01:05:43.004
I'd like to also remind you

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:45.006
that I've booked tomorrow off
for my daughter's party.

01:05:45.174 --> 01:05:46.716
Out of the question.

01:05:47.969 --> 01:05:49.636
My wife has been planning this
for months.

01:05:49.804 --> 01:05:51.012
We've had five assaults this week.

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.223
I got two COs down.
It's out of the question.

01:05:53.391 --> 01:05:55.433
I got people flying in
from all over the place.

01:05:55.601 --> 01:05:57.561
Do I need to remind you
of your responsibilities

01:05:57.728 --> 01:05:58.979
as a unit supervisor?

01:06:02.275 --> 01:06:03.275
It's my kid's birthday.

01:06:03.442 --> 01:06:05.110
These are your kids too.

01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:39.436
This message was the final threat.

01:06:40.938 --> 01:06:42.898
Don't ever do it again.

01:06:57.997 --> 01:07:00.332
Yeah, I put in for the shift change
two weeks ago.

01:07:03.586 --> 01:07:04.586
You know what?

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:07.255
Sometimes I don't think you understand
what I do for a fucking living!

01:07:09.508 --> 01:07:10.926
Hold on.

01:07:12.011 --> 01:07:14.262
What are you looking at?
Get back to work!

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:18.642
I can't talk about this now.

01:07:18.809 --> 01:07:20.644
Man, that fool is pussy-whipped.

01:07:20.811 --> 01:07:23.021
He has no idea
how to talk to his woman.

01:07:23.189 --> 01:07:25.774
My girls would never talk to me
like that.

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:29.110
You ain't got no fucking girls.

01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:30.695
Don't get me started.
All right, man?

01:07:30.863 --> 01:07:32.364
I am way out of your league.

01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:35.700
No, Melissa, I'm not the only one
ruining Grace's birthday

01:07:35.868 --> 01:07:38.203
if they're in the room
while you're screaming at me.

01:07:38.371 --> 01:07:39.621
Name one.

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:41.039
What, like, all of them?

01:07:41.207 --> 01:07:43.541
Shit! It would take me all day
just to get started.

01:07:43.709 --> 01:07:44.626
Just name one of them.

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:47.462
I'm not asking for a list.
Give me a single, solitary name.

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:48.755
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:07:48.923 --> 01:07:51.132
- You don't got nothing, bro.
- I got... Okay, don't worry.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:52.467
Nothing.

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:55.387
Listen, I'll give you one,
but you gotta keep it on the hush-hush.

01:07:55.554 --> 01:07:56.846
Just give us the name, man.

01:07:57.014 --> 01:07:59.015
All right, but I don't wanna get her
in trouble.

01:07:59.183 --> 01:08:01.017
I won't tell no one.

01:08:01.185 --> 01:08:02.268
You know Miss Biggs?

01:08:04.105 --> 01:08:05.814
No.
Oh, yeah.

01:08:05.982 --> 01:08:07.816
What a whore.

01:08:07.984 --> 01:08:09.192
I knew something was up, though,

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.444
'cause we haven't been connecting
in the same way.

01:08:11.612 --> 01:08:14.781
You know why it is? She doesn't like
that earlobe shit that you do.

01:08:14.949 --> 01:08:17.033
You're so full of shit!
You know that?

01:08:17.201 --> 01:08:18.910
Calm down!
It was just a one-time thing.

01:08:19.078 --> 01:08:21.746
I promise. I just had to do the job
for you once.

01:08:21.913 --> 01:08:23.999
And now she's all yours.
It's good. It's good.

01:08:25.917 --> 01:08:28.252
All right, you've seen her naked,
so what does she look like?

01:08:30.089 --> 01:08:33.133
She's got these perfect,
36D titties, all right?

01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:36.011
And then she's got
these firm love handles

01:08:36.178 --> 01:08:38.179
and then that big, flat ass,
you know, that's all right.

01:08:38.346 --> 01:08:40.640
But when you get it going,
it slaps and it claps together.

01:08:40.808 --> 01:08:41.765
It's beautiful.

01:08:41.934 --> 01:08:43.810
What about her labia?

01:08:44.185 --> 01:08:45.562
She was definitely
on that old-school tip,

01:08:45.729 --> 01:08:48.439
you know, with the big bush,
but I still found her spot.

01:08:48.607 --> 01:08:51.734
I just had to machete my way
through her little tropical jungle

01:08:51.902 --> 01:08:53.153
but it was there.

01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:56.865
No doubt.
Oh, it was beautiful. Tasty!

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:01.368
It probably looks something like this.

01:09:04.081 --> 01:09:06.291
Oh, ho, ho, man!
Yeah, that's her.

01:09:09.336 --> 01:09:11.212
You know what, Melissa?
Fuck you too!

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:12.881
That's fucking good!

01:09:14.175 --> 01:09:16.843
How wet is that pussy?
It's just dripping!

01:09:17.011 --> 01:09:18.886
Hey, what are you guys doing?

01:09:20.639 --> 01:09:21.890
Line up, all of you!

01:09:24.643 --> 01:09:26.019
Who drew that?

01:09:28.647 --> 01:09:29.981
Who drew that?

01:09:34.612 --> 01:09:36.071
I did.

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:37.322
Your phone's ringing.

01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:38.656
Shut up!

01:09:38.823 --> 01:09:40.700
Why don't you answer it?

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:43.078
You did.

01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:49.167
Let's take a closer look at your work.

01:09:49.335 --> 01:09:50.251
Don't fucking touch me!

01:09:50.419 --> 01:09:53.004
- Let him go!
- Don't fucking touch me!

01:09:53.546 --> 01:09:56.508
Come on, chill!

01:10:03.682 --> 01:10:04.891
Yo, Angel.

01:10:05.726 --> 01:10:08.103
Hey, bro.
Come on, man. Get up.

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:12.315
Yo, Angel. Get up, man.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.567
What the...

01:10:21.909 --> 01:10:22.992
What the fuck did you do?

01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:25.912
What the fuck, man?

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.289
What the fuck did you do?

01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:29.916
On the ground now.

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:32.669
What the hell happened?

01:10:32.837 --> 01:10:34.629
Goodyear,
what the hell happened?

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:36.756
Tell him what happened!

01:10:36.924 --> 01:10:38.383
- On your belly!
- No!

01:10:38.551 --> 01:10:40.009
On your belly.
Arms to the side.

01:10:40.177 --> 01:10:42.637
Tell him what happened!
What the fuck are you doing?

01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:45.265
Why don't you tell him
what happened, Goodyear?!

01:10:45.432 --> 01:10:46.432
Fucking pussies!

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.976
Tell him what fucking happened!

01:10:48.144 --> 01:10:50.562
If I were you,
I'd be calling my union rep.

01:10:50.729 --> 01:10:53.982
We didn't fucking do anything!
Where's that ammo?

01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:55.859
10-66, south main corridor now!

01:10:56.026 --> 01:10:57.902
Tell him what fucking happened!

01:11:18.591 --> 01:11:20.216
Break it up right now!

01:11:23.304 --> 01:11:25.138
Get away from there.

01:11:26.223 --> 01:11:27.724
What's up, bro?

01:11:28.934 --> 01:11:30.393
I'm back, kid.

01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:44.032
Knock it off! Relax!

01:11:47.328 --> 01:11:49.162
...with Steve Quailer.

01:11:49.330 --> 01:11:51.372
McCleod to Quailer.
And shot! Score!

01:11:52.124 --> 01:11:53.166
Yes!

01:11:55.502 --> 01:11:58.046
You've reached
St. Patrick's Hospital.

01:11:58.214 --> 01:11:59.547
Your call is important to us.

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:02.508
A representative will be
with you shortly.

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:05.303
We appreciate your patience.

01:12:14.355 --> 01:12:16.064
Get the fuck out of here.

01:12:28.285 --> 01:12:29.953
No!

01:12:32.373 --> 01:12:33.915
No! No!

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:35.166
Ah!

01:12:38.671 --> 01:12:39.671
Ow!

01:12:39.838 --> 01:12:41.089
Hello?

01:12:41.257 --> 01:12:43.007
Yes...

01:12:43.175 --> 01:12:45.343
I... I'm calling from Enola Vale
Youth Correctional.

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:48.972
We had somebody admitted there
earlier this evening.

01:12:49.139 --> 01:12:51.224
His name's Angel Ortiz.

01:12:51.642 --> 01:12:54.018
- Well, Officer...
- Come on, man!

01:12:54.186 --> 01:12:55.186
We're sorry to inform you

01:12:55.354 --> 01:12:57.605
that the boy was pronounced dead
two hours ago.

01:12:58.524 --> 01:13:00.066
I'm very sorry.

01:13:21.213 --> 01:13:22.588
Yo, what the fuck are you doing?

01:13:22.756 --> 01:13:24.507
Just fucking hold him.

01:13:28.304 --> 01:13:30.638
No! No!

01:13:51.577 --> 01:13:53.786
Solitary Control.

01:13:55.789 --> 01:13:57.248
Open up cell 9.

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:18.287
Butch. Butch!

01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:28.506
What's up with Angel?

01:15:28.674 --> 01:15:30.258
I don't know.
I didn't hear.

01:15:30.426 --> 01:15:31.843
I'm glad you're back, though.

01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:34.679
Not for long.
I'll be out of this shithole in a week.

01:15:34.847 --> 01:15:36.556
I have some...
Wait, wait.

01:15:37.516 --> 01:15:39.183
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm...

01:16:29.693 --> 01:16:31.486
Who's ringing the bell?

01:16:31.653 --> 01:16:34.155
It's Davis.
I need to use the phone. Please.

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:36.073
Go back to bed.

01:16:37.618 --> 01:16:41.370
Give me the phone.
Let me use the phone, okay?

01:16:42.289 --> 01:16:43.539
Calm down.
He's coming.

01:16:50.464 --> 01:16:53.257
- Davis, what's up, kid?
- I need to use the phone, man.

01:16:53.425 --> 01:16:54.967
Sorry, pal.
I can't let you out.

01:16:55.135 --> 01:16:56.427
Two minutes?

01:16:56.595 --> 01:16:58.554
I can't.
I'll give in a word to Sands

01:16:58.722 --> 01:17:00.389
and you can call
in the morning, okay?

01:17:00.557 --> 01:17:01.724
It has to be now.

01:17:01.892 --> 01:17:04.268
I understand
you're feeling a little homesick,

01:17:04.436 --> 01:17:05.728
but it's 3:00 in the morning.

01:17:08.273 --> 01:17:10.191
I need to talk to my mother.

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:11.400
- Okay.
- Please.

01:17:11.568 --> 01:17:13.694
Try and get some sleep,
and I promise tomorrow,

01:17:13.862 --> 01:17:15.363
everything's gonna be a lot better,
all right?

01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:17.698
- Please...
- Back to bed. Good night.

01:19:01.595 --> 01:19:03.387
Control, open B2.

01:19:27.371 --> 01:19:29.705
Control, open dormitory A1.

01:20:33.145 --> 01:20:35.521
- Hunger strike.
- Hmm.

01:20:52.873 --> 01:20:54.206
Dead.

01:20:57.586 --> 01:20:58.753
Dead.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.629
- Frank.
- Dead.

01:21:00.797 --> 01:21:02.214
Dead.

01:21:02.382 --> 01:21:03.924
Dead.

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:06.427
Dead.

01:21:06.595 --> 01:21:08.888
Dead. Dead.

01:21:09.055 --> 01:21:11.098
Shut the fuck up, Frank.

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:12.349
Dead.

01:21:12.517 --> 01:21:14.226
Dead. Dead.

01:21:14.394 --> 01:21:16.604
Dead. Dead.

01:21:16.772 --> 01:21:18.564
Dead. Dead.

01:21:20.358 --> 01:21:22.401
Shut the fuck up now, Frank.

01:21:22.569 --> 01:21:23.652
Dead! Dead!

01:21:25.363 --> 01:21:28.574
Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:06.904
Get out of here!

01:22:10.075 --> 01:22:11.075
Now go to your left!

01:22:13.078 --> 01:22:14.620
Get the fuck back there!

01:22:15.997 --> 01:22:17.039
Fuck you!

01:22:37.477 --> 01:22:38.936
You fucker!

01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:05.504
Sit the fuck down!
What the fuck are you doing?

01:23:05.672 --> 01:23:07.214
Back off me!

01:23:13.513 --> 01:23:15.931
How about you,
you motherfucker?

01:23:17.934 --> 01:23:20.895
Sands to Control.
I want a permanent lockdown now.

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:23.522
I want you to neutralize this
in five minutes!

01:23:23.690 --> 01:23:26.901
- Sands, we don't have to do this!
- Goodyear, there's no "we"!

01:23:27.068 --> 01:23:29.361
I make the decisions around here!
You got that?

01:23:31.364 --> 01:23:34.116
Get out of here!
Let's go!

01:23:52.928 --> 01:23:54.637
Hey!

01:23:57.057 --> 01:23:59.934
You pussy!
Fucking bitches!

01:25:02.122 --> 01:25:05.374
- Ow!
- Butch! Follow me!

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:19.555
Butch.

01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:21.473
What, man?

01:25:23.977 --> 01:25:25.602
Let's fucking go, man!

01:26:27.332 --> 01:26:28.707
No, no!

01:26:28.875 --> 01:26:29.875
Fuck! No!

01:26:30.043 --> 01:26:32.461
Oh, fuck! No!

01:26:32.879 --> 01:26:33.879
Fuck!

01:26:35.048 --> 01:26:36.924
Oh! No!
