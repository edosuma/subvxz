00:01.014 --> 00:03.947
MAN: <i>So... do you
want to talk about it?</i>

00:05.480 --> 00:06.700
Talk about what?

00:06.785 --> 00:08.523
What happened in gym class.

00:08.991 --> 00:10.271
It was an accident.

00:10.355 --> 00:12.066
And nothing triggered it?

00:12.487 --> 00:13.864
(whistle blowing)

00:22.456 --> 00:24.238
(crowd groaning)

00:27.232 --> 00:28.171
HOPE:
No.

00:28.256 --> 00:30.482
- Like I said, it was an accident.
- Do you think maybe

00:30.567 --> 00:33.043
you were working out
some anger, maybe some

00:33.128 --> 00:34.891
relationship issues?

00:35.997 --> 00:37.110
Okay.

00:38.032 --> 00:40.008
Why don't you tell me
what happened yesterday?

00:40.093 --> 00:41.219
(sighs)

00:41.963 --> 00:43.050
Check this out.

00:43.135 --> 00:45.397
Klaus Mikaelson,
the Great Evil.

00:45.482 --> 00:47.993
Hey, guys,
this is so creepy.

00:48.676 --> 00:50.996
Hope's dad was, like,
 a mass murderer or something.

00:51.081 --> 00:52.799
Well, that makes sense.

00:52.884 --> 00:54.531
(laughter)

00:59.738 --> 01:01.072
Oh!

01:09.335 --> 01:11.105
HOPE:
Yesterday, um,

01:11.213 --> 01:13.138
I had a really bad headache.

01:13.223 --> 01:14.724
- Mm-hmm.
- (door opens)

01:16.671 --> 01:17.995
What is he doing here?

01:18.080 --> 01:19.258
Well, I thought
it would be good

01:19.342 --> 01:21.169
for the
three of us to have a chat.

01:21.262 --> 01:22.971
Well, you can't really have
a couple's session if we're not

01:23.055 --> 01:24.556
a couple, can you?

01:24.910 --> 01:26.077
Right?

01:26.176 --> 01:27.788
I don't know what we are.

01:28.310 --> 01:29.811
Well, he walked away

01:29.896 --> 01:32.071
because he thinks
I can't handle him being human.

01:32.156 --> 01:34.700
Because you can't,
and I didn't walk away.

01:34.785 --> 01:36.998
Your feet physically moved
in a direction away from me.

01:37.083 --> 01:39.352
I mean, I didn't walk away
from the relationship.

01:39.437 --> 01:40.668
Not permanently.

01:40.753 --> 01:42.192
I just needed... I...

01:42.295 --> 01:43.638
What?

01:43.886 --> 01:45.103
I don't know.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.310
HOPE: Yeah, well,
things are complicated, clearly.

01:47.395 --> 01:48.853
I actually think

01:49.035 --> 01:51.498
that it's all connected.

01:51.705 --> 01:53.770
Landon, the anger,

01:53.952 --> 01:55.209
your father.

01:55.293 --> 01:57.099
(laughs)
You're wrong.

01:57.253 --> 01:58.796
I don't have time for this,
all right?

01:58.880 --> 02:00.381
I was on the trail
of a monster,

02:00.465 --> 02:02.049
- A monster?
- So... Yes.

02:02.133 --> 02:03.426
I saw it walk
on the school grounds,

02:03.510 --> 02:05.916
and I tracked it
into the building, and

02:06.337 --> 02:08.693
I tracked it
into this room, actually.

02:13.943 --> 02:15.110
Oh, my God.

02:15.579 --> 02:17.222
You're the monster.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.216
(chuckling):
Hope.

02:19.503 --> 02:21.130
You know who I am.

02:21.262 --> 02:24.063
I'm Dr. Goodfellow.
I'm the guidance counselor here.

02:24.155 --> 02:27.328
You have known me
your whole life.

02:29.212 --> 02:30.870
Remember?

02:35.226 --> 02:37.982
Right.
Sorry.

02:43.609 --> 02:44.960
I can-can go, too.

02:45.045 --> 02:46.762
No, Landon,

02:46.999 --> 02:48.844
I think you should stay.

02:48.971 --> 02:51.355
We need to talk
about your future.

GOODFELLOW:
Don't do it.

03:17.774 --> 03:19.477
You're not ready.

03:20.679 --> 03:22.108
I'm sorry.

03:22.224 --> 03:23.974
- Who are you?
- Ric,

03:24.326 --> 03:27.105
it's me,
Robin Goodfellow,

03:27.190 --> 03:30.123
guidance counselor,
one of your oldest friends?

03:31.179 --> 03:32.745
Remember?

03:35.621 --> 03:37.007
Right.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.991
- (chuckles): Right.
- (laughs)

03:39.258 --> 03:40.947
(chuckling):
I'm sorry. I was so confused.

03:41.032 --> 03:42.438
Yeah.

03:42.522 --> 03:44.565
Well, as someone
who has been there through

03:44.649 --> 03:47.061
all of your relationships,
I have to say,

03:47.146 --> 03:49.676
this feels like a risky time
to start something new.

03:51.083 --> 03:52.358
You're probably right.

03:52.443 --> 03:54.133
Mm-hmm.
Until I figure out a way

03:54.218 --> 03:56.386
to defeat the Necromancer,
I don't have time

03:56.471 --> 03:58.170
to worry
about anything else.

03:58.390 --> 03:59.988
I can see you got
a lot on your mind.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.853
You should take some time.

04:02.333 --> 04:03.886
You know what?

04:04.336 --> 04:06.001
I could run the school
for a little bit.

04:06.213 --> 04:08.196
Handle the day-to-day,
take some stuff off your plate.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.203
You have been running
on empty for

04:10.288 --> 04:12.640
- so long now.
- Hmm.

04:12.725 --> 04:14.309
(laughs)

04:14.554 --> 04:16.082
I could use a break.

04:16.853 --> 04:18.307
It's done.

04:18.546 --> 04:21.216
(snaps fingers)
(laughing): You say no more.

04:21.358 --> 04:23.884
I tell you what you should do
is take some time

04:24.067 --> 04:26.429
to think about
what your real problem is.

04:26.514 --> 04:29.589
And what risks
you're willing to take.

04:30.265 --> 04:32.426
Oh, um, and you know
that accreditation letter

04:32.521 --> 04:33.715
that's sitting
on your desk?

04:33.800 --> 04:36.878
I have come up with a marvelous
new arts program

04:36.963 --> 04:39.037
to satisfy the requirement.

04:45.729 --> 04:47.490
Uh...

04:47.815 --> 04:49.266
Salvatore: The Musical.

04:49.351 --> 04:50.653
Yeah, it's a musical about

04:50.738 --> 04:51.923
the founding of the school.

04:52.008 --> 04:53.886
Dr. Goodfellow said
now that I'm human, that I have

04:53.970 --> 04:55.293
to start thinking
about colleges, and

04:55.377 --> 04:56.920
he told me I'm talented
at writing music.

04:57.004 --> 04:59.065
And apparently, the school
needs a musical program

04:59.150 --> 05:01.318
for the-the accredi...
accreditation board, so...

05:01.403 --> 05:02.585
I don't sing in public.

05:02.625 --> 05:04.376
Okay. Uh, actually,
I-I wanted to...

05:04.460 --> 05:06.391
Sorry.
I wanted to ask.

05:06.550 --> 05:08.816
I know things are
awkward, and we don't

05:08.901 --> 05:10.048
really know what's going on
between us,

05:10.132 --> 05:11.842
but I could really use
your help with all this stuff,

05:11.926 --> 05:14.288
because, I mean, you knew
all these people for real.

05:14.373 --> 05:15.775
Some of it involves your dad.

05:15.860 --> 05:16.888
- What?
- Yeah.

05:16.972 --> 05:18.276
He's part of the story
of the school. You both are.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.912
We're not characters
in your musical, Landon.

05:20.997 --> 05:23.154
- Oh, no. I-I...
- My family stays out of it.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.328
Okay.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.577
Be right back. I'm-a go
kill it. I thought we were

05:29.661 --> 05:31.371
looking for Alyssa.

05:31.715 --> 05:35.236
Dude, she chose to go,
all right? Let her go.

05:35.321 --> 05:37.461
Besides, there's a
sign-up sheet out there

05:37.546 --> 05:38.910
for the musical
auditions.

05:38.994 --> 05:41.663
And I got to get a premium slot.
Apparently, you're not supposed

05:41.747 --> 05:44.082
to be in the first three or
after lunch, unless you can be

05:44.166 --> 05:46.544
second to last. There's a whole
science to this stuff, bruh.

05:49.446 --> 05:51.574
(door closes)
Hey, Greasley.

05:52.329 --> 05:54.032
- What-what are you...
- I'm astral projecting.

05:54.116 --> 05:57.013
Listen, The Necromancer's
preparing for his big evil plan,

05:57.098 --> 05:59.078
so he sent a monster
to distract the school.

05:59.163 --> 06:00.932
But you won't even know
he's a monster.

06:01.016 --> 06:03.978
He can trick you into believing
anything he wants.

06:04.414 --> 06:06.110
Aren't you on the Necro's side?

06:06.195 --> 06:08.957
Sure.
Except...

06:09.625 --> 06:12.469
I can't figure out
how to not care about you.

06:13.122 --> 06:14.486
(whooshing)

06:15.367 --> 06:16.661
Look, I got to go.

06:17.012 --> 06:19.137
Don't be a hero, for once.

06:19.222 --> 06:21.409
Get out.
Even if you figure out

06:21.494 --> 06:24.541
who the monster is,
no one will believe you.

06:28.599 --> 06:32.259
<i>Kaleb vocalizing...

Uh, and which role are
you reading for? (scoffs)

06:47.251 --> 06:48.824
Uh, Damon.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.655
Okay. Cool.
Thanks, man.

06:51.740 --> 06:52.901
I'll be reading for Damon.

06:53.201 --> 06:54.493
Okay.

06:54.578 --> 06:56.301
- Damon.
- Uh-huh.

06:56.396 --> 06:58.930
I see myself as more of a Damon.

06:59.604 --> 07:02.157
Let me guess... Damon?

07:02.615 --> 07:04.293
Uh, actually...

07:04.980 --> 07:06.717
I kind of like Stefan.

07:06.907 --> 07:08.363
- Me, too.
- I mean, he's like the anchor

07:08.447 --> 07:11.200
- to the whole story.
- Exactly.

07:11.644 --> 07:13.143
Yeah, well, you got the part.

07:13.251 --> 07:14.796
- Are-are you serious?
- Yeah.

07:15.056 --> 07:16.473
No one else auditioned
for Stefan.

07:16.629 --> 07:18.713
- Yes! Thank you.
- Yeah,

07:18.806 --> 07:20.898
no, thank you. Nice work.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.484
Yes!

07:22.723 --> 07:24.197
I'm playing Caroline.

07:24.282 --> 07:25.555
Lizzie.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.405
You have to audition.

07:27.962 --> 07:31.878
Are you saying someone knows
my mom better than I do?

07:32.557 --> 07:33.991
Got it.

07:34.540 --> 07:36.962
And I know who
should play Elena.

07:39.369 --> 07:41.310
Me?
We all know you can sing.

07:41.398 --> 07:43.399
Well, that doesn't mean I want
to be the lead in a musical.

07:43.483 --> 07:46.427
But I thought you were step,
stepping into the light.

07:46.512 --> 07:47.982
(gasps) You promised.
Look, you're just

07:48.066 --> 07:51.004
back from a great visit
with Mom, you're feeling good.

07:51.089 --> 07:53.442
This could be a great
opportunity for a non-magic

07:53.527 --> 07:54.886
human to participate

07:54.971 --> 07:56.545
in the school's community.

07:59.019 --> 08:01.179
Can I... read the
script at least?

08:01.264 --> 08:02.996
- Uh... it's... I... It's a work
- Oh, yeah, I want to...

08:03.080 --> 08:06.653
in... progress. Um...

08:08.388 --> 08:10.831
I'm working on it, okay?

08:13.235 --> 08:15.069
I think I've almost cracked it.

08:15.154 --> 08:17.532
Milton, it's me.

08:20.379 --> 08:21.755
I'm the monster.

08:22.249 --> 08:25.094
Oh. (laughs)
Oh.

08:25.241 --> 08:26.912
(English accent):
You're the monster.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.001
(both laugh)

08:28.086 --> 08:30.046
But, look,
Dr. Goodfellow,

08:30.398 --> 08:32.244
uh, that's ridiculous.

08:32.328 --> 08:33.705
I've known you
my entire life,

08:33.789 --> 08:35.961
just like everyone else
at this school.

08:39.072 --> 08:41.684
Which doesn't make much sense,

08:41.770 --> 08:44.256
because how could... 
all of us have known you

08:44.342 --> 08:45.574
our whole lives?

08:47.966 --> 08:49.387
Oh, my God.

08:50.182 --> 08:51.751
The monster's you.

08:51.836 --> 08:55.164
The name's Puck.
Technically,

08:55.577 --> 08:57.007
I am a sprite,

08:57.579 --> 08:59.605
a cousin of the Faerie Folk.

08:59.690 --> 09:01.679
And I always do two things.

09:02.148 --> 09:03.316
The first:

09:03.401 --> 09:05.414
I break people apart.

09:05.771 --> 09:07.774
What's the second thing?

09:13.171 --> 09:15.331
(singing scale): ♪ Me, me, me,
me, me, me, me, me, me ♪

09:15.435 --> 09:21.217
♪ Me, me, me, me, me...
me, me, me, me ♪

09:21.427 --> 09:23.246
- ♪ May, may, may, may, may... ♪
- Kaleb?

09:23.331 --> 09:25.257
- Hey, what?
- Alyssa was telling the truth.

09:25.342 --> 09:26.888
I know who the monster is.

09:26.973 --> 09:28.249
Who?

09:30.010 --> 09:31.556
(stammering)

09:33.312 --> 09:35.695
Who is it? Uh, um...
(speaks gibberish)

09:36.132 --> 09:37.692
Man, you're throwing me,
man. I'm in my groove,

09:37.776 --> 09:39.770
and you just... you
throw it, you know? I...

09:39.977 --> 09:42.345
I just had it,
I-I swear.

09:43.496 --> 09:45.349
I think I got him.

09:48.216 --> 09:50.329
It's like
I can almost see it.

09:50.414 --> 09:52.583
I can picture his face, but...

09:56.988 --> 09:58.033
(gasps)

09:58.133 --> 10:01.055
Dr. Goodfellow,
there's a monster in the school!

10:01.166 --> 10:03.177
It's me, Milton.

10:03.997 --> 10:05.583
(gasps)

10:12.449 --> 10:14.362
So,
I've been able to piece together

10:14.447 --> 10:16.001
that he presents
himself as male.

10:16.093 --> 10:19.517
- Mm.
- And as a doctor of some sort.

10:19.602 --> 10:21.605
And his name starts
with a P,

10:21.690 --> 10:24.236
and he's got this, uh...
this two-part plan.

10:24.321 --> 10:25.692
I just can't
figure out

10:25.777 --> 10:27.403
what the second part is.

10:28.474 --> 10:29.751
It's a mystery.

10:29.836 --> 10:32.126
I feel like I'm this close.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.956
This close.

10:37.406 --> 10:39.241
<i>Singers vocalize...</i>

10:41.388 --> 10:43.056
(vocalizing stops)

10:48.389 --> 10:50.051
Let's take a break.

10:57.321 --> 10:58.529
Hey.

10:58.632 --> 11:00.714
I, uh, really didn't like my
speech on page 43,

11:00.841 --> 11:02.842
so I took a stab at
rewriting it. Trust me,

11:02.927 --> 11:05.816
- this is way better.
- I'll add it to the pile.

11:05.901 --> 11:06.968
Nice.

11:07.053 --> 11:08.292
JOSIE:
Hey.

11:08.466 --> 11:10.675
- Hi.
- So, I don't get Elena at all.

11:10.850 --> 11:12.519
I mean, she can't decide
what she wants, and when she finally

11:12.603 --> 11:14.813
does decide, she makes
a super selfish choice.

11:14.897 --> 11:16.982
Yeah, well, I think everything
around her is changing,

11:17.066 --> 11:19.336
and she wants a normal life,
so she chooses herself.

11:19.421 --> 11:20.932
Ah, see? Selfish.

11:21.016 --> 11:22.857
Oh, oh, and the ending song is
all wrong.

11:22.941 --> 11:24.406
I mean, why would she sing
about undying love

11:24.490 --> 11:26.112
when she's experienced
so much loss?

11:26.197 --> 11:28.490
Because I think the show is
about never giving up on love,

11:28.575 --> 11:29.854
no matter what.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.418
You don't believe that,
though, because

11:31.502 --> 11:33.436
you gave up on Hope,
like, twice.

11:41.540 --> 11:43.592
Let's run Caroline's
number next.

12:01.929 --> 12:05.193
Sorry.
I'm not feeling well today.

12:17.422 --> 12:18.923
I'm fine, Jo.

12:19.861 --> 12:21.896
Does that mean
the bowl's working?

12:21.981 --> 12:23.268
(scoffs softly)

12:24.860 --> 12:26.875
Not even close.

12:30.912 --> 12:32.332
I can't do this.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.527
I can't live up to
our perfect mother.

12:37.133 --> 12:38.794
You should have played her.

12:39.478 --> 12:41.357
- You two are more alike.
- No,

12:41.442 --> 12:43.926
- we're not.
- You're both mature and...

12:44.011 --> 12:45.592
and thoughtful.

12:46.497 --> 12:48.644
I'm just a wild mess.

12:51.674 --> 12:54.826
I've made so much
progress this year,

12:55.666 --> 12:59.815
but no matter how far I come,
I can feel my own mind

12:59.950 --> 13:01.795
plotting against me,

13:01.945 --> 13:05.341
like it's trying to make me lose
everything that I've worked for.

13:08.332 --> 13:10.708
Mom became a vampire,

13:11.469 --> 13:13.139
and everything was just...

13:13.710 --> 13:14.974
clear.

13:15.864 --> 13:18.728
Like she had this one moment

13:18.834 --> 13:21.999
that set her whole life
on course.

13:23.530 --> 13:25.121
What if...

13:26.327 --> 13:27.932
I never get that?

13:36.187 --> 13:38.332
I don't know how
I'm gonna do this.

13:39.112 --> 13:41.984
There's just... there's just
too much going on.

13:42.180 --> 13:43.664
There's travelers and sirens,

13:43.749 --> 13:45.897
and Bonnie just disappears
for long periods of time,

13:45.982 --> 13:46.923
and don't even get me started

13:47.007 --> 13:49.509
on Elena
and the Sleeping Beauty spell.

13:50.448 --> 13:52.188
I'm gonna have to change
the whole ending.

13:52.273 --> 13:54.683
I'm sure you'll make the right
editorial decisions.

13:54.775 --> 13:57.531
Apparently, Dr. Saltzman
used to be this badass,

13:57.616 --> 13:59.123
hard-boiled vampire hunter.

13:59.322 --> 14:01.674
And I think Caroline
was one of his students.

14:02.483 --> 14:03.646
That's kind of weird.

14:03.731 --> 14:04.734
(sighs)

14:04.862 --> 14:06.817
Josie's right.
I have no idea

14:06.902 --> 14:08.653
what I really want
this play to be about.

14:08.785 --> 14:10.545
I have no idea what
I'm really trying to say.

14:10.723 --> 14:12.026
(sighs)

14:16.329 --> 14:18.096
Maybe there's a missing piece

14:18.317 --> 14:20.299
that will unlock
the whole thing.

14:21.783 --> 14:23.308
What if...

14:24.976 --> 14:27.908
there was a way for you
to tell the story you want

14:28.486 --> 14:31.427
and
get Hope back?

14:40.034 --> 14:41.566
(knocking)

14:42.383 --> 14:45.252
Hey. I just
need to say something.

14:46.337 --> 14:48.256
Uh, this whole time I've
been working on the show,

14:48.340 --> 14:51.774
it's felt like I was
missing something, and I was.

14:52.774 --> 14:54.268
You.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.128
I was talking
to Dr. Goodfellow

14:56.213 --> 14:57.756
about what your family
used to say...

14:57.841 --> 14:58.956
Always and forever...

14:59.041 --> 15:01.936
and the last song
suddenly clicked, and...

15:02.552 --> 15:04.343
I want you to read it.

15:06.210 --> 15:09.170
Because you were right
about our separation,

15:09.255 --> 15:10.548
or whatever this is.

15:10.663 --> 15:12.164
I was an absolute idiot.

15:12.303 --> 15:13.648
I want to be
with you,

15:13.733 --> 15:16.259
and I can face anything
if you're by my side.

15:16.344 --> 15:18.346
You used the letter
that my dad wrote me,

15:18.593 --> 15:21.733
that I let you read, as lyrics?

15:22.569 --> 15:24.316
Is that bad?

15:25.195 --> 15:27.764
Okay, it's bad, but
they're beautiful and poetic,

15:27.849 --> 15:29.942
and it shows your dad
in such a great light.

15:30.027 --> 15:32.237
I asked you
not to use my family.

15:32.337 --> 15:34.383
And I tried,
but he's literally

15:34.529 --> 15:36.174
the original vampire
in Mystic Falls.

15:36.259 --> 15:38.554
He's one of the biggest parts
of the whole story.

15:42.711 --> 15:44.791
Look, I figured out
what I want to say.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.770
What I believe
about love and death

15:47.866 --> 15:49.617
and all of it.

15:50.358 --> 15:52.459
- It's this.
- Congratulations.

15:52.544 --> 15:54.888
You cleared up
your musical problem.

16:20.790 --> 16:24.223
Uh, one sec.
Geez! Sorry, sorry.

16:24.308 --> 16:27.129
- Uh, here you go... jackets, scarf.
- Oh, there it is, damn.

16:27.479 --> 16:30.419
Oh, hey, yeah, this line right
here... I'm not saying that.

16:30.599 --> 16:32.395
Okay, well, it's, uh...

16:34.328 --> 16:36.185
Can you come up
with something else

16:36.270 --> 16:37.437
for me to say here?

16:37.662 --> 16:40.373
Thanks.
Uh, uh, okay, I'll, uh...

16:40.529 --> 16:42.875
Thank you, thank you,
I think, um...

16:43.612 --> 16:45.739
- Do you need me to change something?
- No, no, no, no.

16:45.823 --> 16:47.045
You are doing wonderfully.

16:47.130 --> 16:48.673
Yeah, well, you were
wrong about Hope.

16:48.782 --> 16:49.796
She hated the changes.

16:49.881 --> 16:51.376
I'm pretty sure
she hates me now, too.

16:51.495 --> 16:53.752
The cost of following your muse.
Uh, speaking of,

16:53.837 --> 16:56.261
I have further bad news
for you, I'm afraid.

16:56.792 --> 16:59.377
Uh, that one.
Thanks. Thank you.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.626
It would seem that
your Klaus

17:01.733 --> 17:04.112
has been struck down
with a terrible stomachache.

17:04.281 --> 17:05.589
Yes, I know. Tragic.

17:05.679 --> 17:07.608
But there is some
good news.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.030
There is another performer
who is ready to step in.

17:10.115 --> 17:11.548
He already knows
all the music.

17:11.633 --> 17:14.051
Possesses a certain
gravitas.

17:14.137 --> 17:16.593
(laughing):
If I may say.

17:16.852 --> 17:19.771

Thank you.
I feel like I finally get Elena.

25:38.154 --> 25:39.506
At first I thought
that she was selfish,

25:39.590 --> 25:42.242
but she was just being honest
about how she's changed.

25:42.327 --> 25:43.412

I don't know.
I think I tripped.

26:06.688 --> 26:08.762
Hey, she's almost on.
What are we gonna do?

26:11.028 --> 26:12.570
We put Elena in a sleep spell.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.431
Lizzie, in your next scene,
you take all of her lines.

26:14.515 --> 26:15.939
JED:
What about Elena's final song?

26:16.024 --> 26:16.899
It's the end of the
whole show.

26:16.984 --> 26:18.165
Yeah, we'll get there when
we get there. Okay, well,

26:18.249 --> 26:19.204
I'll definitely need
to change some

26:19.289 --> 26:21.289
- of those lines...
- You say the lines as written.

26:22.569 --> 26:23.913
All of you.

26:25.327 --> 26:27.037
(whispers):
Every single word.

26:28.145 --> 26:29.270
Okay.
I liked what you wrote.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.675
(overlapping chatter)
I'm into it.

26:30.793 --> 26:32.503
It's probably my fault anyway...

to reset the bone.

Jade?

26:39.626 --> 26:40.717
Sorry.

26:40.802 --> 26:42.806
I heard the
discussion backstage.

26:43.585 --> 26:44.919
Let me help.

26:46.013 --> 26:47.423
Thanks.

27:10.905 --> 27:12.615
you're special.

27:13.286 --> 27:15.396
Your very existence
is a miracle.

27:19.521 --> 27:22.148
One day you'll grow
into an extraordinary woman

27:22.835 --> 27:24.336
and continue
the legacy

27:24.421 --> 27:25.647
of the Mikaelson name.

27:25.732 --> 27:26.982
AUDIENCE:
Aw.

27:27.602 --> 27:29.312
You'll carry us all
with you.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.438
Carry us well.

27:38.836 --> 27:41.845
I believe this
will be sufficient

27:42.874 --> 27:45.210
to fund your new school.

27:46.300 --> 27:48.385

LIZZIE:
Oh, hey.

27:52.346 --> 27:53.472
Welcome to hell.

27:53.831 --> 27:55.666
Uh, this came for you.

28:05.708 --> 28:07.054
Do you want to ask
me something?

28:07.590 --> 28:10.152
That sounded exactly
like how my father

28:10.237 --> 28:11.259
- would have said it.
- Right,

28:11.343 --> 28:13.344
well, I did meet him
once before.

28:13.436 --> 28:14.801
He was an exceptional
conversationalist.

28:14.885 --> 28:17.159
Very entertaining.
Terrible painter.

28:17.514 --> 28:20.791
Can I ask you something,
and you can... answer it,

28:20.876 --> 28:23.230
I guess, how you think
he would have said it?

28:23.564 --> 28:25.274
Um...

28:27.706 --> 28:29.355
Am I doing enough?

28:29.973 --> 28:33.947
Am I... the person that
he would have wanted me to be?

28:35.107 --> 28:37.150
Oh, my dear girl,

28:37.820 --> 28:40.224
you are entirely
too hard on yourself.

28:41.247 --> 28:45.389
You think that... feeling pain
and heartbreak

28:45.474 --> 28:47.153
means you've done
something wrong.

28:47.631 --> 28:49.868
But we lose everyone
we love eventually.

28:50.601 --> 28:52.578
But feeling that loss,

28:53.307 --> 28:55.406
well, that means you have done
something right.

28:56.162 --> 28:59.801
You opened up your heart
despite the risks.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.931
And that is the legacy
that you will carry on.

29:05.006 --> 29:06.924
(laughs softly)

29:07.461 --> 29:09.380
And now I think you're ready.

29:13.102 --> 29:14.982
Time for the grand finale.

29:26.761 --> 29:30.560
KALEB: I am not letting
you sacrifice yourself like this.

29:31.143 --> 29:32.769
JED:
I already did.

29:34.717 --> 29:36.469
I died, Damon.

29:37.802 --> 29:39.679
But I just wanted
to say goodbye.

29:40.416 --> 29:42.130
I don't have long.

29:44.628 --> 29:47.130
How could you be so stupid?

29:49.828 --> 29:54.021
I was just trying to be
more like you... brother.

29:54.529 --> 29:56.865
AUDIENCE:
Aw.

30:06.677 --> 30:08.506

any minute.

30:17.093 --> 30:18.849
I'm here.

30:19.633 --> 30:21.758
I'm sorry.
There was no other way.

30:22.383 --> 30:24.077
It's okay.

30:24.282 --> 30:26.200
I understand
why you did it.

30:26.722 --> 30:28.312

and grow old with somebody.

37:16.580 --> 37:19.224
But a friend of mine
asked me recently

37:19.309 --> 37:21.844
to think about what I am
willing to risk.

37:22.202 --> 37:25.012
And falling for somebody will
always feel terrifying to me.

37:25.097 --> 37:26.181
But...

37:28.901 --> 37:30.416
(exhales)

37:30.501 --> 37:33.960
I'm here to say
that I-I really think that you

37:34.214 --> 37:36.675
are worth the risk.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.878
(mutters, chuckles)

37:40.011 --> 37:41.304
(laughs)

37:41.427 --> 37:43.000
Get in here.

37:43.878 --> 37:45.295
CAROLINE:
<i>Dear Lizzie,</i>

37:45.854 --> 37:47.642
<i>hopefully this can give you
some perspective</i>

37:47.727 --> 37:49.255
<i>on who I used to be.</i>

37:49.340 --> 37:52.401
<i>When I was your age,
I remember feeling like</i>

37:52.486 --> 37:54.363
<i>I was a total mess.</i>

37:54.966 --> 37:57.778
Like I was waiting to become
a better version of me

37:57.862 --> 37:59.924
so my real life could start.

38:00.448 --> 38:03.576
But it wasn't becoming a vampire
that changed everything.

38:03.660 --> 38:06.245
Change is a series
of small moments

38:06.329 --> 38:10.249
that build on each other like
steps up the side of a mountain.

38:10.514 --> 38:14.003
Your life isn't on hold
until you figure everything out.

38:14.598 --> 38:16.623
It's already happening.

38:16.766 --> 38:20.111
You're already changing,
moment by moment.

38:20.452 --> 38:25.068
And, Elizabeth,
there is nothing wrong with you.

38:25.608 --> 38:28.662
Your brain chemistry creates
unique challenges for you,

38:28.747 --> 38:31.059
but you are not broken.

38:31.409 --> 38:35.412
You are growing and changing
every day.

38:36.016 --> 38:38.687
And it is beautiful to watch.

38:41.882 --> 38:43.828
LANDON: You want
to go first, or should I?

38:44.264 --> 38:46.003
HOPE:
How about at the same time?

38:47.633 --> 38:49.356
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

38:49.441 --> 38:50.900
(laughs softly)

38:51.893 --> 38:55.431
<i>♪ You're my secret appetite,
served up... ♪</i>

38:55.516 --> 38:57.166
Thank you for
saving the show.

38:58.540 --> 39:00.166
<i>♪ You're the taste
to satisfy... ♪</i>

39:00.314 --> 39:02.870
I figured out why I was
so obsessed with it.

39:04.220 --> 39:06.684
The story's about learning
how to say goodbye.

39:06.769 --> 39:08.853
♪ So many nights
to find the one... ♪

39:08.938 --> 39:10.627
I think Rafael leaving
is hitting me harder

39:10.712 --> 39:11.853

39:13.582 --> 39:15.973
<i>♪ Right when I thought... ♪</i>

39:16.163 --> 39:17.393
I know.

39:17.478 --> 39:19.442
<i>♪ You showed the sun to me... ♪</i>

39:19.862 --> 39:21.348
You were right.

39:22.814 --> 39:25.336
About my dad
being in the play.

39:25.421 --> 39:27.656
<i>♪ In and out of love... ♪</i>

39:27.776 --> 39:30.468
You made everyone see him

39:32.416 --> 39:33.541
Thank you.

39:33.862 --> 39:35.196
Always.

39:35.687 --> 39:36.787

39:51.036 --> 39:52.203
MG:
So...

39:52.635 --> 39:54.577
that was your plan all along?

39:54.709 --> 39:58.211
Eh. I sort of make it up
as I go, to be honest.

39:58.296 --> 39:59.547
(both chuckle)

39:59.686 --> 40:01.161
Oh.

40:05.136 --> 40:07.010
You know, the chap
with the terrible acne scars

40:07.095 --> 40:09.097
and the, uh, pit of goo,

40:09.406 --> 40:10.997
he wanted me
to cause chaos

40:11.082 --> 40:14.555
and distract you all, but, uh,
couldn't really help myself.

40:14.640 --> 40:15.725
(chuckles)

40:22.105 --> 40:23.700
Hey.

40:24.008 --> 40:25.982
You're not much of
a monster, are you?

40:26.156 --> 40:27.323
(laughs)

40:27.514 --> 40:29.040
Given the show tonight,

40:29.249 --> 40:32.804
it seems to me that even
monsters can be redeemed.

40:33.814 --> 40:35.643
Especially the ones
that everyone else here

40:35.728 --> 40:37.856
has given up on,
for instance.

40:41.132 --> 40:42.703
I'll see you around, mate.

40:52.883 --> 40:54.580
(groans)

40:54.664 --> 40:56.624
(Necromancer laughs)

40:57.705 --> 40:59.049
NECROMANCER:
The soul exchange

40:59.134 --> 41:00.855
is consecrated.

41:01.097 --> 41:02.228
(laughs)

41:02.313 --> 41:03.714
For every life we take,

41:03.798 --> 41:05.919
we can draw a monster
from the dark.

41:07.266 --> 41:08.726
All we need now

41:08.811 --> 41:10.513
is the final piece
of the triad spell.

41:10.837 --> 41:12.632
I assume you've secured

41:12.717 --> 41:14.010
a vampire?

41:15.810 --> 41:17.186
MG:
Alyssa,

41:17.270 --> 41:19.353
take my hand,
I'll vamp us out of here.

41:28.573 --> 41:30.302
Ad Somnum.

41:32.525 --> 41:34.282
Oh.

41:38.596 --> 41:40.074
Sure did.
