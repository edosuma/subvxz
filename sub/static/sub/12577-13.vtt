the temperature.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.267
Outside temperature

00:42.333 --> 00:45.433

00:49.533 --> 00:51.433
out of way of working man.

00:51.500 --> 00:52.933
I try to get home.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.900
Kahn, even old lady matlow
can drive down the alley

00:55.967 --> 00:57.633
without asking anyone
to move.

00:57.700 --> 00:59.233
What's that say
about you?

00:59.300 --> 01:00.933
I leave for work
when you sleeping.

01:01.067 --> 01:02.367
I come home when you drinking.

01:02.433 --> 01:03.533
What that say about you?

01:03.600 --> 01:06.200
So the man likes
to drink, so what?

01:06.267 --> 01:08.067
It say you not get promotion.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.333
Same old job for you.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.067
Great new project for kahn.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.633
Come with company car.

01:12.700 --> 01:15.833
Inflatable side curtains
almost make you want to crash.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.333
I don't need a promotion.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.833
As assistant manager
of strickland propane

01:19.900 --> 01:21.300

01:21.367 --> 01:23.133
Yeah. Okay.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.200
I leave you to think
about that one.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.333

01:29.400 --> 01:34.133

01:39.133 --> 01:40.067
Beck.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.267
Dark or light?

01:41.333 --> 01:42.467
Dark. Beck dark.

01:42.533 --> 01:44.133
Oh, shoot, I gamble and lose.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.067
Just have heineken

01:46.067 --> 01:48.067
No dark beer

01:48.100 --> 01:50.067
of coordinated project systems?

01:50.067 --> 01:52.067
Oh, kahn!

01:52.067 --> 01:54.067
It is finally yours.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.400
Do you remember
your last promotion?

01:56.467 --> 01:59.200
We had pa son pate

01:59.267 --> 02:00.233
Make love to me.

02:00.300 --> 02:01.433

02:01.500 --> 02:03.433
( howling with laughter )

02:03.500 --> 02:05.367
( gasping ):
aw...

02:05.433 --> 02:08.267
Kahn:
boy, howdy!

02:11.300 --> 02:13.233
Where's redneck?

02:15.467 --> 02:17.367
So, kahn, you need
some propane?

02:17.433 --> 02:18.867
Haven't they
replaced you

02:18.933 --> 02:20.867
with a coin-operated
machine yet?

02:20.933 --> 02:23.067
( sighing ):
just give me
your tank.

02:23.067 --> 02:25.300
I need it filled
to the top this time.

02:25.367 --> 02:26.867
No more screwing me.

02:26.933 --> 02:29.733
I have big party tomorrow
to celebrate my promotion.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.100
I new systems manager.

02:31.167 --> 02:32.333
"systems manager."

02:32.400 --> 02:34.433
Well, hell, I like
the sound of that.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.600
Debbie, that's
your new title.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.067
No! She not in systems.

02:38.133 --> 02:39.933
You disrespect important job.

02:40.067 --> 02:42.700
Well, I can't imagine
anything more important

02:42.767 --> 02:44.233
than what debbie does.

02:44.300 --> 02:47.267
So, uh, so, what kind of
systems do you manage, kahn?

02:47.333 --> 02:48.567
Like a phone system?

02:48.633 --> 02:50.200
Aw, I can't tell you.

02:50.267 --> 02:52.233
We have big army contract.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.767
So, kahn, these phones
that you answer--

02:54.833 --> 02:58.400
Do they sit on a big, fancy
desk, like in a lobby, say?

02:58.467 --> 03:00.633
Hank, you come
to work with me.

03:00.700 --> 03:02.433
You see, it humble you.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.133
No, I don't
think so, kahn.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.133
You see, we have phones
right here in the office.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.133
( chuckles )

03:08.200 --> 03:09.433
I give you tour.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.767
Maybe we give you
big propane contract.

03:11.833 --> 03:14.800
So, you're looking
for a propane contractor.

03:14.867 --> 03:18.500
Well, you know, we at strickland
propane believe that...

03:18.567 --> 03:20.733
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
we be big client.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.967
You sure you can handle this
by yourself?

03:23.067 --> 03:23.967
Maybe I need

03:24.067 --> 03:25.300
more senior redneck.

03:25.367 --> 03:27.667
No. I-i-i, uh... You
got me there, kahn.

03:27.733 --> 03:29.767
We at strickland
propane believe...

03:29.833 --> 03:31.133
( groans )

03:31.200 --> 03:33.100
so, if you could tell me
a little bit

03:33.167 --> 03:36.100
about the company's propane
needs, then I can...

03:36.167 --> 03:38.333
This all mine, hank--
private office.

03:38.400 --> 03:41.133
You got such a bug
in your bonnet
about phones?

03:41.200 --> 03:42.600
Check this out.

03:42.667 --> 03:44.833
I call france on this phone
whenever I want.

03:44.900 --> 03:47.267
France, europe,
huckleberry.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.067
No window?

03:49.067 --> 03:50.433
Na-hah! For security.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.933
Look at this computer.

03:52.067 --> 03:54.067
Fastest processors
in the world.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.367
You got to do
your own typing, huh?

03:56.433 --> 03:58.700
Okay, you come with me.

03:58.767 --> 04:01.867
Hank, you tell anyone
about any of this stuff

04:01.933 --> 04:03.933
they will hunt you down.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.400
You don't have
the clearance.

04:09.467 --> 04:11.933
Nobody trust you
like they trust me.

04:21.267 --> 04:22.733
Now prepare your brain

04:22.800 --> 04:24.367
for razzle-dazzle!

04:24.433 --> 04:27.067
Kahn, I don't have to play golf
with you to sell you

04:27.100 --> 04:28.167
because propane

04:28.233 --> 04:30.267
hits a hole in one
every time.

04:30.333 --> 04:31.767
Now...

04:34.900 --> 04:35.833
Whoa!

04:35.900 --> 04:37.067
Company created

04:37.133 --> 04:39.533
most resilient
ceramic composite ever.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.900
Army want to use it
on all new tanks.

04:41.967 --> 04:43.867
We put it on
this golf club...

04:43.933 --> 04:44.933
Bango!

04:45.067 --> 04:47.067
Ball go 400 yards
every time.

04:47.133 --> 04:48.733
You try. Go ahead.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.067
Take a swing.

04:55.567 --> 04:56.900
( gasping ):
oh...

04:56.967 --> 04:58.200
Impressive?

04:58.267 --> 04:59.567
Yeah.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.233
Aha! You impressed
with kahn's great job.

05:02.300 --> 05:05.300
Huh?
No, no, I'm not.

05:05.367 --> 05:06.667
Too late--
you say it.

05:06.733 --> 05:08.067
Baha!

05:08.067 --> 05:10.200
You impressed-- I win.

05:10.267 --> 05:13.767
Now... Get off my
company's property!

05:13.833 --> 05:15.933
If this is your way
of negotiating

05:16.067 --> 05:17.100
it's working.

05:17.167 --> 05:18.633
Now, I'm prepared
to offer you

05:18.700 --> 05:20.533
a five percent
discount per gallon.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.167
No one want
your dinosaur gas.

05:22.233 --> 05:24.667
This whole place run
on underground fuel cells

05:24.733 --> 05:26.300
that safer
and more efficient.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.833
You mean this whole time...

05:27.900 --> 05:30.333
Yeah. I yank you all afternoon.

05:36.167 --> 05:38.467
( laughing )

05:39.833 --> 05:42.667
you know, this can
never get back to kahn

05:42.733 --> 05:44.667
but after swinging
that club

05:44.733 --> 05:46.800
I literally felt
like dancing.

05:46.867 --> 05:48.267
You know,
in japan

05:48.333 --> 05:51.500
a round of golf
costs $12,000.

05:51.567 --> 05:53.733
You play
from rooftop to rooftop.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.333
The balls are made
out of rice somehow.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.633
And when
you're all done

05:57.700 --> 05:59.733
you got to go home
and sleep in a tube.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.700
You know, I work
in the military

06:01.767 --> 06:04.267
and I have never even
heard of that club.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.167
Hank, you ever
have any regrets

06:06.233 --> 06:08.133
that you didn't go
into systems?

06:08.200 --> 06:10.633
Well, if I couldn't
sell propane like...

06:10.700 --> 06:13.067
Like if I hit my head
and went dumb

06:13.133 --> 06:15.633
and just couldn't
be trusted with it

06:15.700 --> 06:19.067
then, yeah, I might consider
going into systems.

06:19.133 --> 06:22.333
The wind was
really against you
in the back nine, general.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.333
No one could drive
through that.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.533
You did. If you're
going to suck up

06:26.600 --> 06:28.267
make some sense
of it, man.

06:28.333 --> 06:29.233
Well, general

06:29.300 --> 06:31.133
you should try that new club

06:31.200 --> 06:33.833
with the special ceramic
you're developing

06:33.900 --> 06:35.667
with the composite company.

06:35.733 --> 06:37.533
400 yards, every drive--

06:37.600 --> 06:38.967
That's what I hear.

06:39.067 --> 06:41.667
Well, didn't you all
know about the club?

06:41.733 --> 06:44.200
Maybe I shouldn't
have said nothing.

06:45.700 --> 06:49.200
We're going to use that stuff
on our tanks.

06:49.267 --> 06:53.067
Private taylor is gay.

06:53.133 --> 06:54.833
As tu fais
du bicyclette recenment?

06:54.900 --> 06:56.933
Non. J'attend pour
une nouveau bicyclette

06:57.067 --> 06:58.200
avec le cool suspension.

06:58.267 --> 07:00.867
Kahn, we're terminating
your contract.

07:00.933 --> 07:03.567
This business
call, I swear.

07:03.633 --> 07:05.933
I pay for it--
just bill me.

07:06.067 --> 07:08.233
Kahn, you broke
your security agreement.

07:08.300 --> 07:11.200
Vacate the building
within four minutes... Please.

07:11.267 --> 07:14.400
I didn't say
anything to anybody.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.567
Aw, dang.

07:25.333 --> 07:28.433
Say, look-- there's
a ta... It's a taxi.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.867
Dale:
company car trouble, kahn?

07:31.933 --> 07:33.733
Hank hill, you sell me out.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.933
You blab secrets
everywhere

07:36.067 --> 07:37.367
and I get fired.

07:37.433 --> 07:39.133
I didn't. Dale...

07:39.200 --> 07:42.200
Are you posting
our conversations
on the internet again?

07:42.267 --> 07:43.567
Conversations, no.

07:43.633 --> 07:46.333
Actions, whereabouts,
your mowing schedule--

07:46.400 --> 07:47.600
No comment.

07:47.667 --> 07:51.433
See, kahn, nobody
told anybody anything.

07:51.500 --> 07:54.767
I was having a casual
conversation with the general.

07:54.833 --> 07:57.067
I didn't know
we were on the record.

07:57.133 --> 08:00.700
Hank, I confide in you
and you go tell your dog?

08:00.767 --> 08:02.800
They were your secrets
for you to keep.

08:02.867 --> 08:05.867
Now, I'm sorry you were fired,
but it was your own fault.

08:05.933 --> 08:07.067
You sorry for kahn?!

08:07.067 --> 08:08.467
Kahn sitting pretty.

08:08.533 --> 08:10.833
I got severance package
bigger than a year of...

08:14.233 --> 08:15.833
Your salary.

08:17.533 --> 08:19.133
( laughs )

08:19.200 --> 08:20.633
joke's on him.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.733
I don't even make
a living wage.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.700
( chuckles )

08:31.067 --> 08:32.967
hey, peggy, did you hear?

08:33.067 --> 08:34.967
Kahn lost his job.

08:35.067 --> 08:36.299
( mirthless chuckle )

08:36.366 --> 08:38.799
aah, boy,
it's just awful.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.933
Well, systems
is like that.

08:41.067 --> 08:42.732
It's a crazy business.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.167
Why'd you do it, hank?

08:44.232 --> 08:45.133
Do what?

08:45.200 --> 08:46.667
Oh, good lord, hank.

08:46.733 --> 08:48.800
Everybody knows
you can't tell bill anything.

08:48.867 --> 08:51.133
Hey, don't try to make me
into the bad guy.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.200
Kahn's the bad guy.

08:52.267 --> 08:53.833
He leaked government secrets.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.633
He's lucky
they didn't shoot him.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.533
You know who's responsible
for gossip? Gossipers.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.067
You are nothing
but a chatty cathy, hank.

09:01.100 --> 09:03.767
A giant, 200-pound
chatty cathy.

09:05.233 --> 09:07.100
Hi. I heard kahn
lost his job

09:07.167 --> 09:08.467
and that reminded me

09:08.533 --> 09:10.567
I still hadn't
returned your bowl.

09:11.967 --> 09:14.367
Oh, thank you
for dropping by,
peggy hill

09:14.433 --> 09:16.100
but we gonna be just fine.

09:16.167 --> 09:18.700
Something like this
only make us appreciate

09:18.767 --> 09:20.200
how many things we have.

09:20.267 --> 09:22.333
How many, many things.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.767
Just look around you.

09:23.833 --> 09:25.933
Take your time
for peggy hill.

09:26.067 --> 09:28.267
Savor, like you
in museum.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.833
Well, very, very nice.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.333
Oh, breadmaker,
mm-hmm.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.167
Oh, fruit processor.

09:34.233 --> 09:36.167
Oh! A ceramic panda.

09:36.233 --> 09:37.900
Huh, what do you know?

09:37.967 --> 09:40.233
Well, when you need
a shoulder to cry on

09:40.300 --> 09:41.833
I am just across the yard.

09:41.900 --> 09:43.100
As doyle harcavy says

09:43.167 --> 09:45.733
"shoulders make
the best tissues."

09:52.467 --> 09:54.600
...with the marine forecast.
a small...

09:54.667 --> 09:56.433
I fill out form.

09:56.500 --> 09:57.500
I unemployed.

09:57.567 --> 09:58.733
Where my check?!

09:58.800 --> 10:00.400
I'm sorry, sir.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.167
Your past employer
apparently has filed
an objection.

10:03.233 --> 10:04.533
Let's see here.

10:04.600 --> 10:08.067
Under reason for dismissal,
they checked "other"

10:08.133 --> 10:10.067
and then wrote in "treason."

10:10.133 --> 10:12.200
Where my check?!

10:12.267 --> 10:13.900
I'm sorry. Next.

10:16.767 --> 10:18.867
Shackleford, rusty.

10:18.933 --> 10:21.033
Here you go,
mr. Shackleford.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.433
Thank you.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.367
Well, all right, kahn.

10:26.433 --> 10:29.533
You know, you almost look
good enough to sell propane.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.433
You got a job interview already?

10:31.500 --> 10:32.833
You need interview.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.833
I got job-- good job!

10:34.900 --> 10:37.533
In reprographic
imaging industry.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.933
Hey, man, I'm having
a concert this sunday.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.200
Could I put up one of my
posters in your window?

10:45.267 --> 10:48.233
Get out before I
three-hole punch your face!

10:48.300 --> 10:49.800
Dale:
help! I'm stuck.

10:49.867 --> 10:50.867
Mayday!

10:51.900 --> 10:53.733
Well, well, well.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.400
How the mighty have fallen.

10:56.467 --> 10:58.400
Anyhoo, this is what

10:58.467 --> 10:59.700
i'm trying to do:

10:59.767 --> 11:02.300
combine my logo with
a personal message.

11:02.367 --> 11:04.600
Do you now how to
work paintbrush?

11:04.667 --> 11:05.767
Wait. First...

11:05.833 --> 11:07.067
I need you to swear

11:07.067 --> 11:09.100
that what you see here
goes no further

11:09.167 --> 11:10.900
given your history of blabbing

11:10.967 --> 11:13.667
about every top-secret thing
that comes your way.

11:13.733 --> 11:15.133
( frustrated groan )

11:15.200 --> 11:16.467
I can't help you!

11:16.533 --> 11:19.067
I can't help any
of you stupid people!

11:20.467 --> 11:22.733
"how does this machine work,
mr. Kahn?"

11:22.800 --> 11:24.067
"how do I print?"

11:24.133 --> 11:25.133
"how do I save?"

11:25.200 --> 11:26.900
it "control-s," you morons.

11:26.967 --> 11:28.467
It's always "control-s"!

11:28.533 --> 11:30.900
All right, that's
three strikes, kahn.

11:30.967 --> 11:31.833
You're fired.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.500
Three?! That's only two!

11:33.567 --> 11:35.933
I heard what you said
to Mr. Mangione.

11:36.067 --> 11:38.233
( defeated sigh )

11:38.300 --> 11:40.067
see, the man
can't keep a job.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.100
It's his personality--
not me.

11:42.167 --> 11:44.500
Does this mean
connie's broke, too?

11:44.567 --> 11:46.567
They have all got
nothing, bobby.

11:46.633 --> 11:48.467
Connie, too.
nothing.

11:48.533 --> 11:49.733
That's why
I've asked minh

11:49.800 --> 11:50.933
to teach laotian
to bobby.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.967
It's a way to
give them money

11:53.067 --> 11:55.333
without humiliating
them so terribly.

11:55.400 --> 11:59.900
Well, I suppose we could throw
a couple of bucks his way

12:00.067 --> 12:03.533
and, uh, I mean two bucks.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.333
Bobby, there are
only four tone markers

12:07.400 --> 12:08.700
in the laotian language.

12:08.767 --> 12:11.133
Four. That's not so bad.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.300
And 42 consonants and 35 vowel
and vowel clusters.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.333
Connie:
oh, bobby

12:15.400 --> 12:16.833
pretty soon we'll have

12:16.900 --> 12:19.600
a secret language
we can speak in school.

12:19.667 --> 12:20.667
No, connie.

12:20.733 --> 12:22.600
I teach him
southern dialect.

12:22.667 --> 12:24.167
He not the same class.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.067
Hey, flabbermouth.

12:28.067 --> 12:30.533
You break it,
you buy it.

12:32.433 --> 12:35.067
Peggy hill,
so glad you came.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.200
Let me show you

12:36.267 --> 12:37.967
what designer
clothes look like.

12:38.067 --> 12:39.600
Maybe you interested.

12:39.667 --> 12:43.600
Kahn, I love this
ceramic panda
marine radio.

12:43.667 --> 12:44.600
How much?

12:44.667 --> 12:45.833
It too much for you.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.133
No price is
too high.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.167
Just name it.

12:48.233 --> 12:49.567
$700.

12:49.633 --> 12:50.500
Sold.

12:50.567 --> 12:51.167
I mean, $800.

12:51.233 --> 12:52.300
Sold!

12:52.367 --> 12:53.933
No, I take this
off the market.

12:54.067 --> 12:55.967
Delicate equipment
not for redneck.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.167
Kahn, you sell him
that stupid panda.

12:58.233 --> 12:59.300
We need the money.

12:59.367 --> 13:00.333
no!

13:00.400 --> 13:02.533
Yes! You sabotage our sale.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.200
Gribble, make the check
out to me.

13:04.267 --> 13:05.133
With pleasure.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.567
And your name is?

13:06.633 --> 13:09.400
Ahhggg!

13:09.467 --> 13:11.367
Now nobody buy it.

13:11.433 --> 13:12.533
Happy?!

13:12.600 --> 13:13.767
Everyone get off my lawn!

13:13.833 --> 13:14.633
off!

13:14.700 --> 13:15.700
And stay off

13:15.767 --> 13:17.100
or I turn hose on you!

13:17.167 --> 13:19.867
Minh, where my hose?

13:19.933 --> 13:21.200
It went quickly.

13:21.267 --> 13:22.567
( sighs sadly )

13:22.633 --> 13:26.367
the man attacked
his own garage sale, peggy.

13:26.433 --> 13:27.467
He's gone insane.

13:27.533 --> 13:29.367
Hank, you have
to understand.

13:29.433 --> 13:32.133
Kahn, is well aware
that he has been reduced

13:32.200 --> 13:34.400
to the status
of a cafeteria worker.

13:34.467 --> 13:37.700
And you, my dear, you put
that hair net on his head.

13:37.767 --> 13:40.733
Peggy, is it my fault
he makes people hate him?

13:40.800 --> 13:44.267
I don't whisper in his ear
every morning "be a jerk."

13:44.333 --> 13:46.633
That comes from within.

13:46.700 --> 13:51.467
Dad, can I have 15 ngeun bak-gow
for my laotian lesson?

13:51.533 --> 13:55.233
Ngeun bak-gow
better not mean dollar.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.867
( sighs ):
that's it.

14:02.233 --> 14:04.600
Hello, minh. Where's kahn?

14:07.167 --> 14:09.267
Go shout through bathroom door.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.600
He lock himself in.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.067
Nothing wrong with that.

14:12.133 --> 14:13.933
You're supposed
to lock the door.

14:14.067 --> 14:16.067
It helps avoid
embarrassing mishaps.

14:16.067 --> 14:18.100
He not talking to me.

14:18.167 --> 14:19.100
Excuse me.

14:19.167 --> 14:20.967
Things right now...

14:21.067 --> 14:23.300
You know.

14:23.367 --> 14:25.600
This not the first time
khan fired.

14:25.667 --> 14:29.133
Orange county, portland,
mississippi, for god's sake.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.933
Well, the severance that
khan told me about...

14:32.067 --> 14:34.267
Oh, there's no severance,
hear me?

14:34.333 --> 14:35.633
Khan leaked secret.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.067
Broke the contract.

14:37.067 --> 14:38.167
We get nothing.

14:38.233 --> 14:40.333
We live from paycheck
to paycheck

14:40.400 --> 14:42.500
and now we broker
than a stone.

14:42.567 --> 14:46.767
Listen, ah, peggy and I
have just been marveling

14:46.833 --> 14:50.133
at bobby's progress
with laotian so...

14:50.200 --> 14:53.967
Well, I thought I'd pay
for ten lessons up front.

14:55.133 --> 14:56.433
Yeah. Good idea.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.700
What you doing?

15:00.767 --> 15:02.200
We are not charity case.

15:02.267 --> 15:03.200
Yes, we are.

15:03.267 --> 15:04.533
You make us one.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.133
Oh-ho, so, now it's
my fault I fired?

15:07.200 --> 15:08.400
I'm out of here.

15:13.267 --> 15:14.467
( car starts )

15:14.533 --> 15:16.167
( tires screech )

15:20.067 --> 15:20.933
yep.

15:21.067 --> 15:22.367
yeah.

15:22.433 --> 15:23.400
Mm-hmm.

15:23.467 --> 15:24.600
Minh:
connie?

15:24.667 --> 15:26.833
Connie, cow
mah nung num cu!

15:26.900 --> 15:29.067
Mae', how linv
num moo how?

15:29.133 --> 15:30.400
Cow ma nie diao nee!

15:30.467 --> 15:32.567
Tah cawp cuah took
jow gaw took ku gun.

15:32.633 --> 15:34.367
I gotta go.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.467
What was that about?

15:36.533 --> 15:40.067
That was a series
of vowel clusters.

15:42.467 --> 15:44.700
Please tell me
I never looked that bad.

15:44.767 --> 15:46.833
Well, kahn's been gone
for three days

15:46.900 --> 15:48.500
and hasn't so much
as called.

15:48.567 --> 15:50.233
I'll bet he's on an adventure.

15:50.300 --> 15:52.067
It's not him
i'm thinking about.

15:52.100 --> 15:55.133
I mean, what would you do
if dale just suddenly left you

15:55.200 --> 15:56.600
high and dry like that?

15:56.667 --> 16:00.800
Oh, sug, I wouldn't get
out of bed for a week.

16:11.067 --> 16:14.133
Why don't you go
help her out, honey?

16:14.200 --> 16:18.933
Well, the neighborly
thing to do is to
keep our distance.

16:19.067 --> 16:20.067
( sighs )

16:22.667 --> 16:25.600
oh, my!

16:25.667 --> 16:27.067
Need a hand there?

16:27.133 --> 16:29.200
Oh, I surrounded by trash.

16:29.267 --> 16:33.133
Kahn, used to say that
when he look at neighbors.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.067
Well, if there's
anything else you need...

16:36.067 --> 16:38.667
Refrigerator
make terrible noise.

16:38.733 --> 16:40.667
It will break
any second.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.867
Gutters are clogged,
bedroom door stuck

16:43.933 --> 16:45.867
lawn go wild
like jungle.

16:45.933 --> 16:47.900
Come, get your ladder.

16:47.967 --> 16:51.567
Come on, hank hill,
you go on roof now.

17:08.967 --> 17:10.933
So, hank, I certainly
have noticed

17:11.067 --> 17:12.967
how helpful
you've been to minh.

17:13.067 --> 17:14.300
Yeah, and I told her

17:14.367 --> 17:16.233
i'd seal her
driveway tomorrow.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.333
But what about drinking
in the alley?

17:18.400 --> 17:19.467
Yes, exactly.

17:19.532 --> 17:20.867
I can't get
this time back.

17:20.933 --> 17:23.200
I'm just trying to
do the neighborly thing

17:23.267 --> 17:24.300
like you said.

17:24.367 --> 17:25.867
Well, just try
to keep in mind

17:25.933 --> 17:28.067
we don't like them
very much, remember?

17:48.767 --> 17:51.067
It's like he's got
two families.

17:51.133 --> 17:52.067
Two families.

17:52.100 --> 17:53.467
I think that's unfair

17:53.533 --> 17:55.900
when some of us
don't even have the one.

17:55.967 --> 17:57.633
I'd think he likes

17:57.700 --> 18:00.333
being bossed
around by women

18:00.400 --> 18:03.933
if I didn't know
better, which I don't.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.133
Bill.
hank.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.133
Dale.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.133
Hank.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.433
Boomhauer.

18:12.500 --> 18:13.433
Hank.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.267
Polygamist!

18:19.100 --> 18:20.200
( grunts )

18:20.267 --> 18:22.533
minh, uh, I think
what you need is

18:22.600 --> 18:24.867
a new compressor cable
right here.

18:24.933 --> 18:26.600
Preferably a copper one.

18:26.667 --> 18:29.067
So, how would
I get that part?

18:29.067 --> 18:31.067
From the hardware store.

18:31.067 --> 18:33.300
That kind of
far away, right?

18:33.367 --> 18:35.067
Yeah.

18:36.133 --> 18:37.067
( sighs )

18:37.133 --> 18:38.667
i'll pick one up for you.

18:38.733 --> 18:41.067
I was going
to head over there myself.

18:41.067 --> 18:42.400
Just for fun, though.

18:44.800 --> 18:45.933
Is that...?

18:56.533 --> 18:58.067
Where the hell
have you been?

18:58.100 --> 19:00.300
Looking for new wife
since you buy mine.

19:00.367 --> 19:02.867
I was just paying her
for laotian lessons.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.067
And do you know
what I'm doing now?

19:05.133 --> 19:07.400
Buying a part
for your damn refrigerator.

19:07.467 --> 19:08.500
Not in there!

19:08.567 --> 19:10.400
I got shirts soaking
in woolite.

19:10.467 --> 19:12.967
Kahn, go home
and take care of business.

19:13.067 --> 19:15.500
I not go back
without new kickass job.

19:15.567 --> 19:16.767
I show you.

19:16.833 --> 19:19.400
I get job that make you cry
every day.

19:19.467 --> 19:20.533
Look, kahn

19:20.600 --> 19:22.633
I love propane
through-and-through

19:22.700 --> 19:24.633
but-- okay, I'll
give you this.

19:24.700 --> 19:27.500
You're old job was
something else, okay?

19:27.567 --> 19:28.500
Now, go home.

19:28.567 --> 19:29.767
No. I can't fail.

19:29.833 --> 19:32.700
This not supposed
to happen to me.

19:32.767 --> 19:35.200
I'm asian, for god's sake.

19:35.267 --> 19:37.067
More expected of me.

19:37.067 --> 19:38.467
You not understand.

19:38.533 --> 19:40.467
You somebody's worker bee.

19:40.533 --> 19:42.600
If I accept
your redneck life

19:42.667 --> 19:44.667
it like I bury
myself alive.

19:44.733 --> 19:46.967
What about minh and connie?

19:47.067 --> 19:48.333
You my best friend.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.867
You take care of them.

19:49.933 --> 19:51.467
I'm your best friend?

19:51.533 --> 19:52.767
No, I take it back.

19:52.833 --> 19:54.533
Nobody takes care of them.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.767
Time's hard,
but minh's a fighter.

19:56.833 --> 19:57.800
They be okay.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.967
Why you keep watching
me, you pervert?

20:03.033 --> 20:05.333
Somebody get the manager!

20:05.400 --> 20:06.333
noi.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.867
noi.

20:07.933 --> 20:08.867
( snickering )

20:08.933 --> 20:11.133
no. Noi.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.533
noi.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.733
No. Noi.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.833
Bobby, dinner's ready.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.533
Oh, uh, by the way

20:18.600 --> 20:21.533
I accidentally
picked up an extra
bucket of chicken

20:21.600 --> 20:24.200
on the way home, if
you guys are interested.

20:24.267 --> 20:26.667
How do you know
it's extra yet?

20:28.200 --> 20:33.000
( horn honking )

20:34.567 --> 20:37.267
kahn, you got a lot of
( speaks laotian )

20:37.333 --> 20:38.467
to come back here.

20:38.533 --> 20:39.467
I got new job.

20:39.533 --> 20:41.200
Make $20,000 more a year.

20:41.267 --> 20:43.133
Okay. Maybe I let
you back in

20:43.200 --> 20:44.967
but you sleep
on the couch.

20:45.033 --> 20:48.300
I thought you'd be happy
so we pack up quickly.

20:48.367 --> 20:49.467
Job in houston.

20:49.533 --> 20:51.833
Oh, no. I'm not
moving again.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.600
People here grudgingly
accept us.

20:54.667 --> 20:55.633
That's rare.

20:55.700 --> 20:57.200
It three-hour drive.

20:57.267 --> 20:58.467
Not negotiable.

20:58.533 --> 20:59.467
You commute.

20:59.533 --> 21:00.533
Hey, neighbor.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.133
Maybe I buy
your house.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.933
Storage for
my old things.

21:04.067 --> 21:05.533
What you think
of that?

21:05.600 --> 21:07.433
My house is not for sale.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.600
Oh, then I guess I buy your bank
and foreclose on you.

21:12.900 --> 21:15.067
( chuckles )

21:15.133 --> 21:16.733
that's a good one, khan.

21:16.800 --> 21:20.267
Are you laughing or crying
because of my great new car?

21:20.333 --> 21:23.733
Turbo engine, halogen light,
six-cd changer in trunk.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.267
In the trunk?

21:25.333 --> 21:28.167
Well, if you need a hand
installing it in your dash

21:28.233 --> 21:29.200
let me know.

21:29.267 --> 21:30.733
It supposed
to be in trunk.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.500
It plays cds in trunk.

21:32.567 --> 21:35.733
Why? Who's going to want
to ride in the trunk?

21:35.800 --> 21:37.933
You wish you could ride
in my trunk.

21:38.067 --> 21:40.600
My trunk so plush,
it like movie star trunk.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.800
Well, you got
me there, khan.

21:42.867 --> 21:45.900
My trunk is not like
a movie star trunk.

21:45.967 --> 21:48.133
It's just a
family-man trunk.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.067
Thank you, hank.

22:27.067 --> 22:29.767
Kahn: prepare your brain
for razzle-dazzle!
