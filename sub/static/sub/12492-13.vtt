WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:08.776
ALL RIGHT, CLASS.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.478
THESE PROGRESS REPORTS
WILL LET YOU KNOW

00:10.511 --> 00:12.346
HOW YOU'RE DOING
IN ENGLISH SO FAR,

00:12.380 --> 00:16.784
AND FOR MANY OF YOU
I USE THE WORD "PROGRESS"
LOOSELY.

00:16.817 --> 00:19.287
PLEASE LET IT BE AN "A".
PLEASE LET IT BE AN "A".

00:19.320 --> 00:22.456
PLEASE LET IT BE A "C".
PLEASE LET IT BE A "C".

00:22.490 --> 00:26.194
MR. GERKIN, THE FAST FOOD
INDUSTRY IS BOOMING

00:26.227 --> 00:27.595
AND OFFERS
A BRIGHT FUTURE.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.500
- THIS IS GREAT.
- THIS IS TERRIBLE.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.602
- I GOT A "B".
- SO DID I.

00:34.635 --> 00:38.472
( bell rings )

00:38.506 --> 00:41.342
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I GOT A REAL "B".

00:41.375 --> 00:43.211
AS OPPOSED TO WHAT?

00:43.244 --> 00:45.446
A "D" THAT I HAVE TO
WRITE ANOTHER "D" ON TOP OF

00:45.479 --> 00:48.349
TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE A "B".

00:50.284 --> 00:53.354
MR. DINGWALL,

00:53.387 --> 00:55.323
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUICK QUESTION?

00:55.356 --> 00:57.258
YOU JUST DID.
GOODBYE.

00:58.559 --> 01:02.530
NO, ACTUALLY
IT'S ABOUT MY GRADE.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.266
I WAS KIND OF
EXPECTING AN "A".

01:05.299 --> 01:06.334
"A"--

01:06.367 --> 01:09.470
THE SAME LETTER THAT BEGINS
THE WORDS "ANNOYING"

01:09.503 --> 01:11.172
AND "ADIOS."

01:13.241 --> 01:16.244
CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY I GOT A "B"?

01:16.277 --> 01:18.146
ENGLISH IS
MY BEST SUBJECT.

01:18.179 --> 01:22.616
ALTHOUGH MY MATH
AND SCIENCE TEACHERS
WOULD ARGUE WITH THAT.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.619
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE--
ALOHA.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.157
( rock music playing )

01:29.190 --> 01:30.624
* TODAY'S ALL BURNT TOAST

01:30.658 --> 01:32.293
* RUNNING LATE,
AND DAD SAYS *

01:32.326 --> 01:34.595
* HAS ANYBODY
SEEN MY LEFT SHOE? *

01:34.628 --> 01:37.131
* I CLOSE MY EYES,
TAKE A BITE *

01:37.165 --> 01:38.599
* GRAB A RIDE,
LAUGH OUT LOUD *

01:38.632 --> 01:41.502
* THERE IT IS
UP ON THE ROOF *

01:41.535 --> 01:44.872
* I'VE BEEN THERE,
I'VE SURVIVED *

01:44.905 --> 01:48.142
* SO JUST TAKE
MY ADVICE *

01:48.176 --> 01:50.278
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

01:50.311 --> 01:51.679
* THINGS ARE CRAZY

01:51.712 --> 01:54.648
* BUT I KNOW
YOUR FUTURE'S BRIGHT *

01:54.682 --> 01:56.884
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

01:56.917 --> 01:58.419
* THERE'S NO MAYBE

01:58.452 --> 02:01.322
* EVERYTHING
TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT *

02:01.355 --> 02:03.624
* YOUR LIFE
IS UP AND DOWN *

02:03.657 --> 02:07.261
* BUT TRUST ME,
IT COMES BACK AROUND *

02:07.295 --> 02:11.365
* YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
WHO YOU TURN OUT TO BE *

02:12.700 --> 02:15.403
* HANG IN THERE, BABY.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.679
HEY, READY FOR YOUR
BASKETBALL GAME?

02:25.713 --> 02:27.548
DO I HAVE TO GO?

02:27.581 --> 02:29.450
ALL WE EVER DO IS LOSE.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.185
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

02:31.219 --> 02:34.288
SOMETIMES YOU FORFEIT.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.490
OH, HONEY, IT'S IMPORTANT
TO THINK POSITIVE.

02:36.524 --> 02:39.627
TRUE, YOU'VE LOST 11 GAMES
IN A ROW

02:39.660 --> 02:42.330
AND YOU'RE DEAD LAST
IN THE LEAGUE, BUT--

02:42.363 --> 02:45.599
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
I'M GOING WITH THIS.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.301
BAD NEWS, GABE.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.370
I CAN'T COACH
YOUR GAME TODAY.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.671
JUST GOT AN EMERGENCY
EXTERMINATION CALL.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.206
WHAT'S THE BIG EMERGENCY?

02:52.240 --> 02:53.541
LADYBUG INFESTATION.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.343
AWW.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.378
OH, SURE, ONE'S CUTE.

02:57.411 --> 03:01.582
THOUSANDS--
UNSPEAKABLE HORROR.

03:01.615 --> 03:04.452
SO I GUESS
WITHOUT A COACH

03:04.485 --> 03:06.620
WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO PLAY OUR GAME TODAY.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.457
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
I CAN COACH.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.992
( laughs )
THAT'S CUTE, HONEY,

03:12.025 --> 03:14.462
BUT COACHING'S A LITTLE
YOU MIGHT THINK. THAN

03:14.495 --> 03:19.333
OH, HONEY, I CAN LOSE
JUST AS GOOD AS YOU CAN.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.502
WHAT AM I SAYING?
I CAN'T COACH.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.371
I HAVE MOMMY & ME
WITH CHARLIE.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.406
I COULD TAKE CHARLIE
TO MOMMY & ME.

03:25.439 --> 03:28.409
HONEY, THAT'S CUTE,
BUT MOMMY & ME

03:28.442 --> 03:31.745
IS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED
THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.

03:31.779 --> 03:35.349
ACTUALLY, IT'S REALLY NOT.
YOU GO AHEAD AND TAKE HER.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.651
ALL RIGHT, HONEY,
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE IN.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.253
HERE'S THE PLAYBOOK.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.788
NOW THIS MIGHT BE
A LITTLE OVER YOUR HEAD,

03:40.821 --> 03:43.257
SO JUST DO YOUR BEST.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.459
Xs ARE OUR TEAM.
Os ARE THE OTHER GUYS.

03:45.493 --> 03:48.729
OKAY, THE Xs HAVE LOST
11 GAMES IN A ROW, RIGHT?

03:48.762 --> 03:51.432
- RIGHT.
- WE'RE GONNA BE THE Os
THIS WEEK.

03:57.338 --> 04:00.274
Hi, Charlie, it's your
big sister Teddy here.

04:00.308 --> 04:03.544
Or should I say
Big Failure Teddy?

04:03.577 --> 04:06.814
I just wanted to show you
how sad I look

04:06.847 --> 04:08.682
after I got
my first "B".

04:08.716 --> 04:10.818
And I just want to show you
how happy I look

04:10.851 --> 04:12.853
when I got
my first "B".

04:20.861 --> 04:22.363
Whoo!

04:22.396 --> 04:24.398
Sorry you had to
see that.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.369
I DO NOT DESERVE A "B".

04:28.402 --> 04:31.339
I FELT THE SAME WAY.

04:31.372 --> 04:34.575
YOU KNOW, I KNOW WHY DINGWALL
GAVE ME A BAD GRADE.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.510
HE JUST DOESN'T LIKE ME.

04:36.544 --> 04:39.413
YOU KNOW,
THAT COULD BE.

04:39.447 --> 04:42.450
WHENEVER HE TALKS TO YOU,
HE MAKES A FACE LIKE
SOMEBODY JUST CUT ONE.

04:42.483 --> 04:45.386
BUT IT'S NOT FAIR.

04:45.419 --> 04:47.321
I NEVER CUT ONE.
IT'S ALWAYS GERKIN.

04:47.355 --> 04:50.458
SO WHAT IF DINGWALL
DOESN'T LIKE YOU?
WHO CARES?

04:50.491 --> 04:52.760
I CARE.
NO ONE'S EVER
NOT LIKED ME BEFORE.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.629
I DON'T MEAN TO BE CONCEITED,
BUT LIKABLE PEOPLE LIKE ME
ARE LIKED.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.531
IT'S JUST A FACT.

04:57.565 --> 05:00.868
AS LONG AS
YOU'RE NOT CONCEITED.

05:00.901 --> 05:04.472
I KNOW WHAT I GOTTA DO--
GET DINGWALL TO LIKE ME.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.707
I KNOW WHAT I GOTTA DO--
MORE DANCING.

05:06.740 --> 05:10.344
I STILL GOT SOME HAPPY
LEFT IN ME.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.846
YOU'D BETTER WATCH OUT
IF I EVER GET AN "A".

05:19.587 --> 05:22.856
- HEY, DAD.
- HEY, HOW WAS MOMMY & ME?

05:22.890 --> 05:24.858
IT WAS AWESOME.
THE MOMS LOVED ME.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.894
I TOLD THEM SOME JOKES,
MADE THEM LAUGH,

05:26.927 --> 05:29.863
TAUGHT THEM HOW TO CHANGE
THEIR RINGTONES.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.699
DID CHARLIE HAVE
A GOOD TIME?

05:31.732 --> 05:35.469
I DON'T KNOW.
I WASN'T REALLY
WATCHING HER.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.473
SO?
HOW BAD WAS IT?

05:39.507 --> 05:41.842
IT WAS TERRIBLE.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.778
IT WAS TERRIBLE
FOR THE OTHER TEAM

05:44.812 --> 05:48.382
BECAUSE WE WON!
WE WON. OOH OOH!

05:48.416 --> 05:50.484
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
WHERE'S GABE?

05:50.518 --> 05:52.653
HE WENT OUT FOR ICE CREAM
WITH THE REST OF THE TEAM,

05:52.686 --> 05:57.591
RIGHT AFTER THEY
CARRIED ME TO MY CAR,
CHANTING "AMY! AMY!"

05:57.625 --> 06:01.595
REALLY, SUCH A FUSS.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.531
DID THE OTHER TEAM
JUST NOT SHOW UP?

06:03.564 --> 06:05.399
OH, THEY SHOWED UP,

06:05.433 --> 06:07.801
BUT THEY WISH THEY HADN'T.
KAPOW!

06:07.835 --> 06:11.505
THAT'S AMAZING.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.641
ACTUALLY, IT WASN'T
AS HARD AS YOU THOUGHT.

06:13.674 --> 06:16.577
I JUST TOLD THE BOYS
TO GO OUT THERE
AND HAVE FUN.

06:16.610 --> 06:17.845
DID YOU AT LEAST
USE THE PLAYBOOK?

06:17.878 --> 06:19.480
ABSOLUTELY.

06:19.513 --> 06:22.783
THE BENCH WAS FREEZING,
SO I SAT ON IT.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.553
( phone ringing )

06:25.586 --> 06:27.688
HELLO.
HEY, ANGIE.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.858
LOOK, I'M SORRY I COULDN'T
MAKE IT TO MOMMY & ME--

06:30.891 --> 06:33.427
YOU WANT TO TALK
TO P.J.?

06:33.461 --> 06:35.796
I THINK HE'S HERE.
HANG ON A SEC.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.832
- P.J.
- YEAH?

06:38.866 --> 06:41.469
HELLO.
OH, HEY, ANGE.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.737
YEAH, IT WAS FUN
HANGING OUT WITH YOU TOO.

06:43.771 --> 06:46.607
( laughing )

06:48.609 --> 06:51.845
THAT'S HILARIOUS.

06:51.879 --> 06:56.517
OH NO, YOU DIDN'T.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.752
YOU GUYS MIND?
THIS IS KINDA PERSONAL.

07:00.688 --> 07:03.724
BY THE WAY, DID YOU SEE
LINDA'S HAIR?

07:03.757 --> 07:06.927
RIGHT?

07:11.532 --> 07:13.667
HEY, THERE'S MY WINNER.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.736
( laughs )

07:15.769 --> 07:18.238
- HEY, DAD.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.574
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY
A FLUKE, RIGHT,

07:20.608 --> 07:22.610
HAPPENING WHEN
YOUR MOM WAS COACHING?

07:22.643 --> 07:24.612
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK WE CAN BUILD ON THIS.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.981
YEAH YEAH.
DAD, WE NEED TO TALK.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.683
- WHAT ABOUT?
- HAVE A SEAT.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.585
OKAY.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.555
WHAT'S UP?

07:34.588 --> 07:36.490
THESE THINGS
ARE NEVER EASY.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.592
WHAT THINGS?

07:38.626 --> 07:40.794
LOOK, THE TEAM
TALKED THINGS OVER

07:40.828 --> 07:43.664
AND WE THINK IT'S
IN EVERYONE'S BEST INTEREST

07:43.697 --> 07:47.000
IF WE MAKE SOME CHANGES
INVOLVING THE COACHING STAFF.

07:47.034 --> 07:50.638
THE COACHING STAFF?
I'M THE COACHING STAFF.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.675
YEAH.

07:56.910 --> 08:00.047
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

08:00.080 --> 08:03.984
ARE YOU FIRING ME?

08:04.017 --> 08:06.654
AFTER EVERYTHING
I'VE DONE FOR THIS TEAM?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.656
WE WISH YOU THE BEST.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.293
OH, COME ON.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.729
OH, COME ON.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.765
HEY, GIVE ME
ANOTHER CHANCE.

08:17.798 --> 08:18.866
I CAN TURN
THIS THING AROUND.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.602
I THINK
WE'RE DONE HERE.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.676
OH, DAD,

08:28.709 --> 08:31.712
WOULD YOU SEND MOM IN?
I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS
FOR HER.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.320
HEY, MR. "D".

08:40.353 --> 08:42.556
GOT A LITTLE
PRESENT FOR YOU--

08:42.590 --> 08:45.893
SOME YUMMY HOMEMADE BROWNIES,
JUST 'CAUSE.

08:45.926 --> 08:49.763
SCHOOL DISTRICT POLICY
PROHIBITS ME FROM
RECEIVING GIFTS

08:49.797 --> 08:51.799
WHICH, JUDGING BY THESE,

08:51.832 --> 08:55.603
DOES NOT APPEAR
TO BE A TRAGEDY.

08:55.636 --> 08:59.707
WELL, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
HAVE A SWEET TOOTH LIKE ME--

08:59.740 --> 09:02.710
JUST ONE MORE THING
WE HAVE IN COMMON,

09:02.743 --> 09:05.779
I MEAN, BESIDES OUR
ETHNIC HERITAGE.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.981
THIS SHOULD BE GOOD.

09:08.015 --> 09:11.018
DINGWALL IS A SCOTTISH NAME,
LIKE DUNCAN.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.786
I LOOKED UP
YOUR FAMILY CREST.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.321
DID YOU KNOW THAT IT'S
TWO EAGLES IN FLIGHT?

09:14.354 --> 09:17.024
MISS DUNCAN,
LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.326
YOU'RE HERE ABOUT
YOUR GRADE, RIGHT?

09:19.359 --> 09:22.596
YOU ARE ONE SHARP
SCOTTISH COOKIE.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.134
THE ISSUE IS
YOUR ORAL BOOK REPORTS.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.002
I WORK VERY HARD
ON THOSE.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.871
THEY'RE LIFELESS
AND DRY,

09:30.904 --> 09:33.907
AND THAT'S
COMING FROM ME.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.043
OKAY, SO I'LL
JAZZ THEM UP.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.345
FIND A WAY TO MAKE
THE BOOK COME ALIVE.

09:38.378 --> 09:41.381
PUT YOUR ENERGY INTO THAT
INSTEAD OF KISSING UP
TO YOUR TEACHER,

09:41.414 --> 09:44.151
WHICH I FIND SHALLOW,
INSULTING AND--

09:44.184 --> 09:46.019
ADORABLE!

09:46.053 --> 09:49.156
- WHAT?
- HONEY, COME ON, LET'S GO.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.759
WHO-- WHO--
WHO IS THAT?

09:51.792 --> 09:54.027
WHO IS THAT?

09:54.061 --> 09:56.029
THAT'S MY MOM
AND MY SISTER CHARLIE.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.699
AREN'T YOU
THE CUTEST BABY EVER?

09:58.732 --> 10:00.400
WE LIKE TO THINK SO.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.670
AND YOU LOOK
JUST LIKE YOUR MOMMY.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.072
IF YOU'RE SAYING
I'M THE CUTEST MOMMY EVER,

10:05.105 --> 10:07.775
I ACCEPT.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.711
TEDDY DEAR, I HAD NO IDEA
YOU HAD A BABY SISTER.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.179
TEDDY?
DEAR?

10:12.212 --> 10:16.183
WHO IS THAT?
WHO IS THAT?

10:16.216 --> 10:17.918
WHO IS THAT?

10:17.951 --> 10:19.787
PEEK-A-BOO.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.933
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M WATCHING MY BOOK.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.036
FOR YOUR BOOK REPORT?

10:36.069 --> 10:38.138
THAT'S RIGHT.

10:38.171 --> 10:41.074
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO,
OH, I DON'T KNOW,
READ YOUR BOOK?

10:41.108 --> 10:42.943
TEDDY, GET WITH IT.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.979
KIDS DON'T READ ANYMORE.
YOU'RE SO OLD SCHOOL.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.048
AND IF YOU DON'T READ
YOUR BOOK, YOU'RE GONNA BE

10:48.081 --> 10:50.684
OLD AND STILL GOING
TO SCHOOL.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.219
HEY.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.888
SORRY. I'M JUST
A LITTLE UPSET

10:54.922 --> 10:57.424
ABOUT MY CONVERSATION
WITH MR. DINGWALL.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.460
HE WAS TELLING ME
HOW BORING I WAS,

11:00.493 --> 11:03.096
AND THEN CHARLIE CAME IN
AND HE LIT UP LIKE
A CHRISTMAS TREE.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.432
- WELL, THERE'S YOUR ANSWER.
- TO WHAT?

11:05.465 --> 11:07.901
TO GETTING AN "A".

11:07.935 --> 11:09.703
YOU SHOULD DO
YOUR PRESENTATION

11:09.737 --> 11:12.773
DRESSED UP LIKE A BABY.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.242
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I MIGHT HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.044
AND I'D LOVE
TO HEAR IT,

11:17.077 --> 11:20.748
BUT THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS
JUST TOOK OFF HIS SHIRT.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.119
GABE.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.255
HEY, HONEY, YOU COMING
TO GABE'S BASKETBALL GAME?

11:28.288 --> 11:31.124
- WHAT FOR?
- BECAUSE YOU'RE HIS FATHER.

11:31.158 --> 11:34.094
OR HAS HE FIRED ME
FROM THAT TOO?

11:34.127 --> 11:37.931
YOU'RE STILL UPSET
ABOUT THIS COACHING THING?

11:37.965 --> 11:40.133
OF COURSE NOT.

11:40.167 --> 11:43.470
ALTHOUGH ACCORDING TO THE
BY-LAWS OF THE DENVER JUNIOR
BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION,

11:43.503 --> 11:45.172
ARTICLE 17, SECTION 9,

11:45.205 --> 11:48.008
THE TEAM IS NOT ALLOWED
TO TAKE A VOTE AND REPLACE ME,

11:48.041 --> 11:51.311
BUT I'VE LET IT GO.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.815
GOOD.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.118
OH.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.286
HI, DAD.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.054
GABE.

12:01.088 --> 12:04.825
THIS IS AWKWARD.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.493
I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU HERE.

12:06.526 --> 12:10.330
IN MY HOME?

12:13.100 --> 12:15.068
GABE, HONEY,

12:15.102 --> 12:18.205
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WOULD
LIKE TO SAY TO YOUR FATHER?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.107
YEAH.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.875
DAD, I'M GONNA NEED
THE WHISTLE.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.812
( doorbell rings )

12:24.845 --> 12:27.147
HEY, ANGE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:27.180 --> 12:28.916
IT'S GIRLS' NIGHT OUT.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.819
OH, YOU'RE KIDDING.
TONIGHT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.553
ACTUALLY, I'M HERE
TO PICK UP P.J.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.856
WHAT'S UP, GIRLFRIEND?

12:35.889 --> 12:37.024
OOH OOH!

12:38.892 --> 12:40.193
ARE YOU GOING OUT
WITH THE MOMS?

12:40.227 --> 12:42.229
YEAH, GONNA HAVE
SOME APPETIZERS,

12:42.262 --> 12:45.933
MAYBE DO A LITTLE KARAOKE,
JUST LET OUR HAIR DOWN.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.868
ACTUALLY, JEANNIE RENTED
A CHICK FLICK,

12:47.901 --> 12:49.136
SO WE'RE GONNA HANG
AT HER PLACE.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.805
A CHICK FLICK?

12:51.839 --> 12:54.174
I'M GOOD TO GO.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.143
DON'T WAIT UP.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.178
OKAY, THAT'S JUST WEIRD.

12:58.211 --> 13:01.181
NO, WHAT'S WEIRD IS
THAT I COACH THOSE KIDS
FOR HALF A SEASON AND--

13:01.214 --> 13:03.216
OH, LET IT GO, BOB.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.824
( boys cheering )

13:13.193 --> 13:15.295
ARE YOU HAVING FUN
OUT THERE, KIDDO?

13:15.328 --> 13:18.331
MOM, CAN YOU NOT SEE
THE SCOREBOARD?

13:18.365 --> 13:22.269
IT'S 44-12.
WE'RE GETTING CREAMED.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.308
GABE, OVER HERE NOW.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.310
WHAT?

13:30.343 --> 13:32.880
WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE
FIRED YOUR DAD.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.114
IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.117
DUDE, I WAS HOPPED UP
ON ICE CREAM.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.853
WELL, IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.254
OR IS IT?

13:41.288 --> 13:43.991
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.359
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
- I'M SAYING IT'S TIME

13:46.393 --> 13:50.297
TO HIKE UP YOUR SKIRT
AND FIRE YOUR MOM.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.344
HEY, MOM,
WE NEED TO TALK.

14:04.377 --> 14:08.415
SURE. WHAT'S ON
YOUR MIND, HONEY?

14:08.448 --> 14:10.283
THESE THINGS
ARE NEVER EASY.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.652
YOU'RE FIRING ME,
AREN'T YOU?

14:12.685 --> 14:15.655
YEP.

14:15.688 --> 14:19.993
WELL, AT LEAST ONE OF US
IS UNDEFEATED.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.896
GOOD LUCK, LOSERS.

14:25.265 --> 14:29.236
HEY, DAD, OLD PAL,
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

14:29.269 --> 14:31.171
LET ME GUESS--

14:31.204 --> 14:33.173
COACH "FUN"
DIDN'T WORK OUT,

14:33.206 --> 14:34.674
SO NOW YOU'RE
CRAWLING BACK TO DAD.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.310
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE I'VE MOVED ON.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.446
FINE.
I'LL GO ASK NICK'S DAD.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.649
NO NO NO.
I'LL DO IT.
I'LL DO IT.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.185
GUYS, MEN, COME ON,
GATHER ROUND.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.220
LISTEN UP.
ALL RIGHT.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.257
WE'RE GONNA PULL TOGETHER.
WE'RE GONNA PLAY AS A TEAM.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.259
AND WE'RE GONNA
GIVE IT OUR ALL.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.694
- AND THEN WE'LL WIN?
- NOT A CHANCE.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.230
BUT HERE'S
WHAT WE CAN DO--

14:57.264 --> 15:02.202
WE CAN GO OUT THERE
AND WE CAN LOSE WITH DIGNITY.

15:02.235 --> 15:06.039
LOSE WITH DIGNITY!
LOSE WITH DIGNITY!

15:06.073 --> 15:08.241
YEAH!

15:09.977 --> 15:12.312
HEY, GUYS,

15:12.345 --> 15:14.948
COME ON BACK.
IT'S ONLY HALFTIME.

15:23.190 --> 15:26.393
"ANIMAL FARM"
BY GEORGE ORWELL.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.362
"ANIMAL FARM" IS A STORY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS

15:29.396 --> 15:31.698
WHEN IDEALISTIC ANIMALS
TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR FARM

15:31.731 --> 15:33.466
FROM THE EVIL
HUMAN OWNERS.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.735
OOF.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.106
NOW I'D LIKE
TO INTRODUCE YOU

15:39.139 --> 15:41.975
TO SOME OF THE ANIMALS.

15:42.009 --> 15:45.378
MEET SNOWBALL THE PIG.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.414
CHARLIE'S A PIG.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.749
I'VE DIED
AND GONE TO HEAVEN.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.319
SNOWBALL, TELL US
ABOUT YOURSELF.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.387
OH, I'M GOOD-HEARTED

15:54.421 --> 15:57.224
AND I BELIEVE
THAT ALL ANIMALS
SHOULD BE TREATED FAIRLY

15:57.257 --> 16:00.393
AND SHARE THEIR
PROPERTY EQUALLY.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.129
THANKS, SNOWBALL.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.730
TIME TO GET BACK
TO THE FARM.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.133
BYE, SNOWBALL.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.401
BYE.

16:09.569 --> 16:13.006
BUT ALL IS NOT WELL
ON THE FARM,

16:13.040 --> 16:15.275
BECAUSE HERE COMES--

16:15.308 --> 16:18.278
- ( hums an ominous tune )
- ( gasps )

16:18.311 --> 16:22.282
--NAPOLEON,
THE CONQUEROR PIG.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.185
( laughs )

16:25.218 --> 16:28.088
( in French accent )
I AM A TROUBLEMAKER.

16:28.121 --> 16:31.224
I TELL SOME OF THE ANIMALS
THEY'RE BETTER THAN OTHERS.

16:31.258 --> 16:34.061
THAT'S RIGHT,
I'M A BAD PIG.

16:35.462 --> 16:39.766
( muttering )

16:39.799 --> 16:41.468
OH OH OH.

16:43.570 --> 16:47.440
THAT IS MY NEW
SCREEN SAVER.

16:47.474 --> 16:50.210
BUT THANKFULLY,
MURIEL THE GOAT

16:50.243 --> 16:53.280
CALMS THINGS DOWN
WITH SOME OF HER
WORDS OF WISDOM.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.549
( clears throat )

16:56.583 --> 16:59.552
COME ON, MURIEL.

16:59.586 --> 17:02.555
I'M GONNA SEE
WHAT'S KEEPING HER.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.425
- WHAT'S THE HOLDUP?
- CHARLIE'S KINDA GASSY.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.095
MIGHT BE THOSE FISH STICKS
WE FED HER IN THE CAFETERIA.

17:08.128 --> 17:10.497
- ( Charlie fusses )
- THEY'RE TALKING BACK
TO ME TOO.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.400
OKAY, I'D BETTER
WRAP THINGS UP.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.335
COME HERE.
COME HERE.
YES YES YES.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.370
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.

17:17.404 --> 17:23.143
AND HERE IS MURIEL
THE FAST-TALKING GOAT.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.112
HEY, KIDS.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.613
WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY?

17:26.646 --> 17:29.316
READ THE BOOK.

17:29.349 --> 17:32.319
SO IN THE END
THE ANIMALS BECOME

17:32.352 --> 17:34.321
JUST AS EVIL AS THE HUMANS
THEY OVERTHREW.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.856
AND NOW YOU CAN'T
TELL THE ANIMALS...
FROM THE HUMANS.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.626
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

17:39.659 --> 17:43.096
BRAVO, MISS DUNCAN.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.597
YOU MADE THE BOOK
COME ALIVE,

17:44.631 --> 17:48.201
AND IN THE MOST
ADORABLE WAY.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.411
I'M-- I'M--
I'M SO SORRY.

17:58.445 --> 17:59.579
IVY, HELP.

18:03.683 --> 18:07.254
OH, HERE COME
THE STICKS.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.291
( retches )

18:23.436 --> 18:26.373
WELL,

18:26.406 --> 18:30.143
NOW IT SMELLS
LIKE AN ANIMAL FARM.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.316
HEY, MOM.
HEY, DAD.

18:36.349 --> 18:39.552
HEY, HOW WAS STORY TIME
AT THE LIBRARY?

18:39.586 --> 18:42.189
IT WAS OKAY.
WE READ "EVERYBODY POOPS."

18:42.222 --> 18:45.325
THE TITLE KIND OF
GIVES AWAY THE ENDING.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.626
DID CHARLIE HAVE FUN?

18:46.659 --> 18:48.528
I DON'T KNOW.
WE DIDN'T SIT TOGETHER.

18:48.561 --> 18:51.431
ANYWAY, I'M GONNA BE
TAKING OFF AGAIN SOON.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.565
GOING OUT
WITH THE MOMS AGAIN?

18:52.599 --> 18:55.302
NO NO, I'M DONE
WITH THAT.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.936
- I'M GLAD YOU'RE OVER IT.
- ME TOO.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.172
WHAT WAS I THINKING?
WHAT DO I HAVE IN COMMON

18:59.206 --> 19:00.707
WITH A BUNCH OF WOMEN
IN THEIR 30s?

19:00.740 --> 19:03.510
( doorbell rings )

19:05.312 --> 19:08.548
MOM, DAD,
THIS IS MARGE,

19:08.581 --> 19:11.584
THE STORY LADY
FROM THE LIBRARY.

19:11.618 --> 19:14.287
WE'RE GOING TO TEA.

19:19.659 --> 19:23.596
THESE ARE YOUR GRADES
ON YESTERDAY'S FINAL
PRESENTATIONS.

19:23.630 --> 19:28.601
MR. GERKIN, FIT YOURSELF
WITH A HAIRNET.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.537
MISS WENTZ.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.606
OH MY GOSH.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.742
MISS DUNCAN, YOUR GRADE

19:35.775 --> 19:38.278
AND MY DRY-CLEANING BILL.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.213
OH MY GOSH.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.615
( bell rings )

19:44.551 --> 19:45.952
TWO "B"s IN A ROW?

19:45.985 --> 19:48.555
WHAT IF MY MOM STARTS
TO EXPECT THIS?

19:48.588 --> 19:50.623
I'D BETTER
TURN THIS INTO A "D".

19:54.327 --> 19:56.463
- MR. DINGWALL.
- YES?

19:56.496 --> 19:58.565
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THANK YOU FOR MY "A".

19:58.598 --> 20:00.967
YOU EARNED IT,
FOR CREATIVITY,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.403
IMAGINATION AND STYLE.
NICELY DONE.

20:03.436 --> 20:04.637
THANK YOU.

20:04.671 --> 20:06.639
NOW PRETEND THAT BELL
WAS A FIRE ALARM

20:06.673 --> 20:10.777
AND THE FLAMES ARE
UPON US.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.346
JUST ONE MORE THING.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.348
YOU KNOW,
I HAD THIS CRAZY IDEA

20:15.382 --> 20:17.984
THAT THE REASON YOU WERE
BEING SO TOUGH ON ME

20:18.017 --> 20:19.652
WAS BECAUSE
YOU DIDN'T LIKE ME.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.422
IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

20:24.657 --> 20:27.594
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
YOU LIKE ME, RIGHT?

20:27.627 --> 20:30.530
TEDDY,

20:30.563 --> 20:32.799
NOT EVERYONE IN YOUR LIFE
IS GOING TO LIKE YOU,

20:32.832 --> 20:35.502
AND THE REASON MAY HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.270
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'VE FAILED.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.539
JUST MEANS YOU'RE HUMAN.
OKAY?

20:39.572 --> 20:41.741
OKAY.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.544
BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU NEVER ACTUALLY SAID
IF YOU LIKE ME--

20:44.577 --> 20:48.047
OKAY.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.683
OKAY, IF YOU LIKE ME,
DON'T SAY A WORD.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.619
- GOODBYE.
- UGH!

20:57.724 --> 21:00.760
Well, Charlie, no more
fish sticks for you.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.763
But thanks for all your help
with Mr. Dingwall.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.299
Because of you
I got an "A". Whoo!

21:06.333 --> 21:09.302
And I learned that not everyone
is going to like me,

21:09.336 --> 21:12.672
and I'm okay
with that.

21:12.705 --> 21:15.742
I'm working on being
okay with that.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.844
But just in case...

21:17.877 --> 21:20.847
Wish me good luck,
Charlie.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.361
GO GO GO.
COME ON, COME ON.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.699
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE TEAM?

21:39.732 --> 21:41.634
THEY WENT THATAWAY.

21:47.574 --> 21:49.642
COME ON, COME ON.

21:57.650 --> 22:01.388
HAVE YOU SEEN THE--?

22:04.424 --> 22:06.793
DUNCANS.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.599
STILL CAN'T FIND THEM?

22:12.632 --> 22:14.701
NO.

22:14.734 --> 22:18.137
AND I'VE SEARCHED
THE ENTIRE CITY.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.673
WHERE WAS ALL THIS ENERGY
DURING THE GAME?

22:27.714 --> 22:30.116
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS COACHING

22:30.149 --> 22:32.719
WE DIDN'T HAVE
THIS PROBLEM.
