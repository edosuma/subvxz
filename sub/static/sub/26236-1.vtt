02:05.208 --> 02:07.961
- Ora Blackwood, illustrator.
- Avis Tasker, nursing.

02:08.252 --> 02:10.922
- Ah, the live wire.
- Don't flatter.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.133
- Four papers on opiates, Miss Tasker?

02:13.425 --> 02:14.676
Flattery's in order.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.472
- Charles, this is Matsudaira
Basho, a taxonomist.

02:18.764 --> 02:19.931
- You can call me Matt.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.808
- Charles Horne, cartography.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.061
- Welcome to the last run.
- Yes.

02:24.353 --> 02:26.938
Skip the next three months,
cap and gown me now.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.274
A second.

02:31.276 --> 02:34.738
Ah, sorry, allergies,
rushing to get better.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.493
- So where is my little brother?

02:41.453 --> 02:43.330
- Preserving a little culture.

02:43.622 --> 02:44.373
- Oh, radish!

02:44.665 --> 02:45.999
- That's not my name!

02:46.291 --> 02:47.376
And I'm gonna go put this with the canoes.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.044
- Here, Rudy, I'll take--
- I can do it.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.046
- I'll take it.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.255
- Come here.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.090
Come here.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.676
- Yeah, yeah, who else is
gonna buy you out of that mess?

02:55.967 --> 02:58.595
- Ah, not dad.
- No, not dad.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.806
You're bigger.
- You're cleaner.

03:01.098 --> 03:04.559
- University life, brother,
makes a gentleman of us all.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.937
- So where's your professor?

03:07.229 --> 03:08.397
- What do you mean?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.190
- I mean, we got in last night,

03:10.482 --> 03:13.777
there were no lamps, no
welcome party, no nothing.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.320
- He hasn't been here this morning?

03:15.612 --> 03:16.613
- Nope.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.157
- Great, probably forgot what month it is.

03:19.449 --> 03:22.035
We'll head out, I'm sure,
meet up along the way.

03:22.327 --> 03:22.869
- Right.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.997
- Gentlemen, you wanna
quit jabbing and help?

03:40.220 --> 03:41.680
Be careful with that.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.474
- Don't you worry, Miss
Blackwood, I have a steady hand.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.226
- Tell that to the hundred
dollars worth of paint

03:46.518 --> 03:48.228
and colors in that box.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.371
- Ora.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.747
- I love you guys.

05:31.039 --> 05:31.748
Hey, c'mon!

05:32.749 --> 05:33.750
Hey, wait up!

06:10.871 --> 06:12.205
- Doctor Keating!

06:13.415 --> 06:14.165
'Om?

06:14.457 --> 06:15.166
- What?

06:15.458 --> 06:19.254
- What if he's sleeping?
- What if he's sleeping?

06:32.392 --> 06:33.310
- It's dead.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.155
- Sleeping, huh?

07:11.056 --> 07:13.391
Doctor Keating!
- Doctor Keating!

07:13.683 --> 07:15.936
- Doctor Keating!
- Doctor!

07:16.227 --> 07:19.147
- Doctor Keating!
- Professor!

07:19.439 --> 07:21.650
- Doctor Keating!
- Professor!

07:22.651 --> 07:25.195
Doctor Keating!
- Professor!

07:25.487 --> 07:27.530
- Doctor!
- Doctor Keating!

07:29.699 --> 07:31.534
- Doctor Keating!

07:46.174 --> 07:47.258
- I guess that
just depends, buddy.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.469
Wouldn't he be hunting for us?

07:49.761 --> 07:51.596
That's what I thought.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.182
Maybe you should leave
the hunting with me.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.350
Oh, this gun?

07:56.935 --> 07:59.020
- Oh wait, don't put
that, don't get that big hammer.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.939
- Yeah, I've had
it for a little while now.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.608
Top of my most prized possessions.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.694
- Really, you kidding now?

08:05.986 --> 08:07.821
- Rudy, get your hands off.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.287
- Ah, great.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.380
- Four days.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.383
- What?
- It's enough for four days.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.302
He burned everything fresh.

08:31.594 --> 08:34.222
All the vegetables and the meat.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.475
- Is there any chance those
chests just went rotten?

08:37.767 --> 08:39.936
- Well, Keating's a
doctor of plant biology.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.605
He wouldn't just burn everything
in his student's research

08:42.897 --> 08:45.275
camp to get rid of a few spots of mold.

08:45.567 --> 08:46.860
- I say we focus on where he is.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.653
- I am focusing on where he is.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.489
- All we know is he's been
missing for the last 15

08:51.781 --> 08:53.324
- 19, about 20 hours.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.369
- Right and I've been
going through his papers

08:56.661 --> 08:58.913
and he's done about 50 sketches.

08:59.205 --> 08:59.748
- Which means?

09:00.040 --> 09:02.709
- He's been working steadily
for at least 10 days.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.086
- And he's been here how long?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.004
- Two weeks.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.173
- So, either Keating left camp

09:08.465 --> 09:12.177
in the past four or
something's happened to him.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.595
That's what you're saying?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.347
- No, I think we're
saying he should be here.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.224
- His trunk's locked.

09:18.516 --> 09:19.142
- What?

09:21.269 --> 09:22.979
- I was putting away everyone's things,

09:23.271 --> 09:24.647
setting up cots and I looked to see

09:24.939 --> 09:27.525
what I could find in his tent.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.111
His trunk is locked and there's no key.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.156
- I mean, that could just be privacy.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.574
- Or something else.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.242
- Well, I also found
medicine and chemicals

09:36.534 --> 09:37.786
in the kitchen and by
the fire this morning.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.081
- Like what?
- Like disinfectants, mainly.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.582
Boric acid, some sal volatile.

09:42.874 --> 09:43.917
- Why is it we're not just getting on

09:44.209 --> 09:45.460
with what we're here to do?

09:45.752 --> 09:47.462
- Right, Charles.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.048
And ignore the fact that
we have four days of food

09:50.340 --> 09:54.010
and our next supply drop is in a month.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.708
- You were on The Discovery?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.293
The Discovery?

11:08.585 --> 11:09.878
- The ship Shackleton died on?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.212
- Shackleton died on the Quest.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.714
- He didn't die on the Quest.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.132
The Quest brought him to Antarctica,

11:14.424 --> 11:16.301
where he died on his quest.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.219
- I mean, you worked with whales?

11:18.511 --> 11:19.220
- Well, no.

11:20.138 --> 11:24.142
I worked with the man who
worked with whales, but yeah.

11:24.434 --> 11:27.437
Long before you saw me on that road,

11:27.729 --> 11:31.024
I was this close to a South Georgian Blue.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.651
- Such a spinster.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.947
- Why, I think it sounds
terribly exciting?

11:38.239 --> 11:41.910
Ventures in the Atlantic, marine mammals,

11:42.202 --> 11:44.787
working on a Antarctic research ship.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.041
- Avis, he wasn't working on
a Antarctic research ship,

11:48.333 --> 11:50.501
he was dish washing.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.795
- Basho, nine months under the same roof,

11:53.087 --> 11:53.963
where's the loyalty?

11:54.255 --> 11:56.424
- Alright, enough beating the gums.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.509
I bring the bootleg!

11:58.801 --> 11:59.677
- Yeah, Rudy!

12:00.678 --> 12:02.680
- Ora, you drink like a mouse in the city,

12:02.972 --> 12:03.890
you're going blind tonight.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.975
- Well, look at this.
- Haviland, not a word.

12:06.267 --> 12:10.605
I smuggled it in, I'm
making the toast, this is to

12:10.897 --> 12:12.941
a hunter who not only
didn't catch anything today,

12:13.233 --> 12:14.442
he says he didn't see anything.

12:14.734 --> 12:15.693
' Boo.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.657
- A nurse, who builds
a fire like a soldier,

12:22.492 --> 12:26.955
a man who's gonna chart
more dreams than maps.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.040
Boo!

12:29.332 --> 12:31.000
- Good first impression, sheik.

12:31.292 --> 12:34.254
- And my best friend, also Ora.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.090
- Thanks.

12:37.382 --> 12:41.094
- No, this is my first
expedition and whatever this is,

12:41.386 --> 12:44.264
whatever balled-up trip for
biscuits this has turned into,

12:44.555 --> 12:46.641
wherever the hell Keating is,

12:46.933 --> 12:49.352
we are certainly without supervision,

12:49.644 --> 12:52.855
so tomorrow we're gonna
search for the parents,

12:53.147 --> 12:55.483
but tonight, we're gonna get sauced

12:55.775 --> 12:58.987
'cause if we're out of food
and I have to walk out of here

12:59.279 --> 13:02.657
after one day in camp, I need a drink.

13:02.949 --> 13:06.703
I need to get so bent, fried, horri-eyed

13:06.995 --> 13:09.580
and ossified that I can't remember

13:09.872 --> 13:13.918
what every epiphytic
bryophyte species grows

13:14.210 --> 13:15.920
on an a sear's sag ram.

13:16.879 --> 13:17.630
- What?

13:17.922 --> 13:20.174
- He doesn't even know what that means.

13:22.844 --> 13:26.347
- I've already found what
I need in this place.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.265
To us.

13:30.727 --> 13:33.563
And to the shortest of expeditions.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.192
Also, here.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.694
I had these made.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.031
I was gonna give 'em
out on our first dinner,

13:43.323 --> 13:45.450
but well, you know how that goes.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.585
- This is one of the best
damn things I ever got.

13:55.877 --> 13:59.255
- Yeah, yeah, it
cost more than your shirt.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.883
Now let's make dead soldiers
out of this liniment.

15:12.245 --> 15:17.125
R on, my Papa I

15:41.566 --> 15:42.316
- So...

15:44.110 --> 15:46.362
But how did a girl like that

15:47.822 --> 15:50.241
get wrapped up with this lot?

15:50.533 --> 15:51.826
- You seen her art?

15:52.118 --> 15:53.786
- Her what?
- Her art.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.205
Keating, famous for his art.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.876
Ora makes him look like a child.

16:00.168 --> 16:01.878
- Oh, right.

16:02.837 --> 16:05.798
- She grew up in greenhouses
the size of this camp.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.383
I think--

16:07.675 --> 16:10.219
Haviland, she's taking, Haviland,

16:10.511 --> 16:11.971
she's taken care of more plants

16:12.263 --> 16:14.765
than half the professors who teach us.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.101
Her mother's a horticulturist.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.103
- Her mother's a what?
- A Hortibidulterous.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.938
- A what?

16:21.230 --> 16:22.773
- Wouldn't say it.

16:23.065 --> 16:26.736
Her mother's a, her mother's a florist.

16:27.028 --> 16:27.653
- I see.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.157
At the university, she's a woman,

16:31.449 --> 16:32.700
they see flowers, they see--

16:32.992 --> 16:37.705
- The first woman in the
country with a botany degree.

16:37.997 --> 16:41.584
But it wasn't easy, she
had to fight to get in.

16:41.876 --> 16:44.253
Keating persuaded 'em, saw her art,

16:44.545 --> 16:48.841
but there's still a lot
who don't believe in her.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.427
I think they're scared.

16:51.719 --> 16:52.762
She's too good.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.516
- Well...

16:56.807 --> 16:59.727
- Oh.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.646
- That's something.

17:01.938 --> 17:02.563
- Quite.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.484
Oaf, someone's half under.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.319
- Oh, in your dreams.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.955
- No practice with the British, huh?

17:20.248 --> 17:24.210
- You know what it's like
playing chess on a ship?

17:27.296 --> 17:29.298
I'm gonna go take a piss.

17:31.759 --> 17:32.510
- Hey yo.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.174
- Smoke?

18:14.051 --> 18:14.802
Basho.

18:15.970 --> 18:16.721
Basho!

18:17.930 --> 18:19.557
- What is it?
- Basho!

18:19.849 --> 18:21.225
- What?

18:21.517 --> 18:22.852
- Look.

18:23.144 --> 18:23.686
- What?

18:23.978 --> 18:25.688
Forget how to use it?
- Oh, shut up.

18:25.980 --> 18:26.606
Look.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.190
- What?

18:28.482 --> 18:29.108
- There.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.026
- Where?
- Smoke.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.068
Hanging between the trees.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.361
- What smoke?

18:32.653 --> 18:33.529
- Do you think maybe it's the professor?

18:33.821 --> 18:35.990
Or maybe a distress signal or--

18:36.282 --> 18:36.907
- Shh.

18:39.952 --> 18:40.703
Hold this.

18:41.912 --> 18:45.875
- Where are you going?
- Button your pants.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.001
- What?

18:47.293 --> 18:48.669
What are you doing?

18:50.504 --> 18:51.255
Matt.

18:53.591 --> 18:54.342
Matt.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.309
- Run!

19:03.601 --> 19:04.644
- What?
- Pollen!

19:06.395 --> 19:07.021
- Pollen?

19:10.691 --> 19:13.194
- Man, I got it all over me.
- That's a good look on you.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.781
- It's not just smoke, it's pollen.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.842
- Hello!

20:25.307 --> 20:25.933
Hello!

20:42.950 --> 20:44.785
- So this is the area where
you've been collecting?

20:45.077 --> 20:46.412
- And we walked it yesterday, no sign.

20:46.704 --> 20:50.249
- Alright, and these?
- All the grids we strung.

20:50.541 --> 20:52.084
- Right, so
we've come up the river,

20:52.376 --> 20:54.628
seen the north coast of two lakes

20:54.920 --> 20:57.757
and I've been up here on
the mountain and nothing?

20:58.048 --> 20:59.800
- What's that?
- What?

21:00.092 --> 21:00.843
- There.

21:01.135 --> 21:02.553
- Train tracks.
- A train?

21:02.845 --> 21:04.180
- It's a train line that
comes from a copper mine

21:04.472 --> 21:05.473
up near the Labrador shelf.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.183
- From Labrador?
- Yeah.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.560
The track's about a week
out and I think they said

21:09.852 --> 21:11.270
the engine comes through twice a month,

21:11.562 --> 21:13.147
first Wednesday or Thursday or--

21:13.439 --> 21:15.357
- Any maps?
- No they don't have any maps.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.151
Or they don't want to give them up.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.196
They came in, cut the woods,
laid tracks, moved on.

21:20.488 --> 21:21.947
Industry at its finest.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.366
Now, the way I like to do this is

21:24.658 --> 21:27.536
instead of starting
everywhere we don't know,

21:27.828 --> 21:30.372
we start in the places we do.

21:30.664 --> 21:31.332
- What's he saying?

21:31.624 --> 21:33.542
- He's saying he wants to go to the mill.

21:33.834 --> 21:34.835
- What?
- We need to go to the mill.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.462
- Charles, you can't--
- What, Rudyard?

21:36.754 --> 21:37.463
What are they gonna do?

21:37.755 --> 21:39.048
We're paying them, there's
nothing down there,

21:39.340 --> 21:41.550
except for rotting shacks
and abandoned juice joints.

21:41.842 --> 21:42.968
- I think he means why on earth

21:43.260 --> 21:44.261
would Keating go to the mill.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.472
- Because it's the only
place marked on this map

21:46.764 --> 21:47.723
that we haven't checked.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.266
- There's also lakes marked on the map.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.393
- Alright, listen to
me, in times of crisis

21:51.685 --> 21:54.230
human beings move towards what they know.

21:54.522 --> 21:58.067
And I found this in
his notes this morning.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.451
- So, you're whining because
you're not getting bitten?

22:07.743 --> 22:09.954
- I'm not whining, I'm simply asking

22:10.246 --> 22:11.872
where all the bugs are!

22:12.164 --> 22:14.291
I wake up this morning
expecting hills of red

22:14.583 --> 22:16.293
and not only am I barren,
I don't know anyone

22:16.585 --> 22:18.170
who got bit around that fire last night.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.423
- So you're whining because
you're not getting bitten.

22:21.715 --> 22:24.009
- Alight, how far are we?

22:24.301 --> 22:25.219
- Should be coming up.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.763
Trip down is faster
than the trip coming up.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.306
- Yeah, that's called a current, Charles,

22:29.598 --> 22:31.475
and it's gonna hurt later today.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.978
- Jack to me as long as
we're not riding a waterfall.

22:34.270 --> 22:35.646
- A waterfall?

22:35.938 --> 22:36.689
- Awaterfall powers the mill.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.983
You'll hear it once we
start getting closer.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.235
The lakes in this river all lead into it.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.529
The current's not so bad
if here where we tie up,

22:43.821 --> 22:46.657
but keep going down
further, gets pretty bad.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.993
- And you cats wanna paddle back tonight?

22:49.285 --> 22:50.494
- I'm not the one in charge here.

22:50.786 --> 22:54.832
- Matt, man, how
long is this gonna take?

25:01.583 --> 25:02.501
- Ora.
- Yes?

26:38.597 --> 26:39.473
- Ora!
- What?

26:40.516 --> 26:43.727
- Haviland, have you seen any animals?

26:44.019 --> 26:45.562
- What?

26:45.854 --> 26:47.981
- Have you seen any animals?

26:49.525 --> 26:51.902
- Basho, I just busted through
a quarter mile of forest.

26:52.194 --> 26:54.196
I probably stepped on a few,
but I am not in the mood

26:54.488 --> 26:55.614
right now to be questioned
as to my skills as a hunter.

26:55.906 --> 26:56.657
- No, that's not what we're saying,

26:56.949 --> 26:58.826
we're saying have you seen anything?

26:59.118 --> 27:03.330
Any fish, any squirrels,
any bugs here in the forest?

27:04.998 --> 27:06.041
- No.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.584
- No?

27:07.876 --> 27:08.502
- No.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.172
- Alright, we need to search.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.174
We really need to search right now.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.010
- For what?
- For anything.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.138
Any animals, any bird or insect.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.765
Anything living in this forest.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.774
- Doesn't make much sense, does it?

27:31.066 --> 27:32.526
- What?

27:32.818 --> 27:34.111
- Building a pulp mill all the way up here

27:34.403 --> 27:35.612
and then abandoning it.

27:35.904 --> 27:39.116
- Yeah, it's called bad business.

27:39.408 --> 27:42.369
- How many families lived down there?

27:42.661 --> 27:45.164
- We don't know, we've had
trouble finding any records.

27:45.455 --> 27:48.041
- Maybe that's because...

27:48.333 --> 27:49.459
They never left.

27:50.794 --> 27:53.547
Come on, ladies, no time to waste.

28:03.223 --> 28:04.933
- You ever seen one?

28:05.225 --> 28:05.851
- What?

28:07.060 --> 28:08.228
- A ghost town.

28:09.521 --> 28:10.272
- No.

30:25.240 --> 30:25.991
- Oh.

30:36.084 --> 30:36.835
Oh my god.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.359
- So what the hell's that mean?

31:00.650 --> 31:02.944
- It means two hours, not one of us

31:03.236 --> 31:06.656
has seen so much a ruffle in the leaves.

31:06.948 --> 31:08.200
- Maybe there was a forest fire?

31:08.492 --> 31:11.536
- Does it look there was a forest fire?

31:15.665 --> 31:17.918
- We need to open his trunk.

31:19.002 --> 31:21.588
- Avis, he's fine, he's just...

31:23.507 --> 31:24.841
Avis, he's nuts.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.385
- Rudyard, stand back.

31:26.676 --> 31:30.055
- You have
to calm down, Rudyard.

31:41.108 --> 31:42.859
- Charles, let him go.

31:45.195 --> 31:46.613
Charles!- Get off!

31:49.199 --> 31:49.950
No.

31:51.118 --> 31:53.286
No, why is he wearing that?

31:54.579 --> 31:56.081
What the hell is he wearing a mask for?

31:56.373 --> 31:58.708
We're not suppose to be out here!

32:30.532 --> 32:33.326
- You're the god damn nurse!
- Don't yell at me, Charles.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.078
- You're the god damn nurse.

32:35.370 --> 32:36.663
- And you're in shock,
you're losing your head.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.165
- I'm losing my head?

32:38.457 --> 32:39.249
I'm losing my head?

32:39.541 --> 32:41.501
I'm not the one suggesting
we drag his body

32:41.793 --> 32:43.378
back to our camp!
- We have to!

32:43.670 --> 32:46.089
- You have to shut up, Avis.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.382
Shut up.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.551
If either of you thinks
we're dragging that body back

32:49.843 --> 32:51.678
to our camp with its sickness,

32:51.970 --> 32:54.431
you have another think coming.
- Don't yell at her, Charles.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.224
- His eyes and neck are swollen and blue.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.894
He's not contagious, the
man's carrying smelling salts!

32:59.186 --> 33:01.480
- To what?
- To use on himself!

33:01.771 --> 33:04.524
He died of a reaction to
something that he was breathing.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.401
He's wearing a mask!

33:06.693 --> 33:09.237
- It's idiotic.
- What's idiotic?

33:09.529 --> 33:12.491
- He's bleeding from the mouth, Avis.

33:12.782 --> 33:14.701
You're honestly going to pretend

33:14.993 --> 33:16.661
that you know what's going on here?

33:16.953 --> 33:18.705
- Yes, I know
that whatever he inhaled

33:18.997 --> 33:20.624
acted like a corrosive.

33:20.916 --> 33:22.083
Fine, I don't know!

33:22.375 --> 33:23.668
I don't know, Charles, I
don't know what did this

33:23.960 --> 33:25.045
and that's why I need to
bring him back to camp.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.379
- To what?

33:26.671 --> 33:28.840
Cut him open, swap around, let him bleed

33:29.132 --> 33:30.425
on our mess table?

33:31.426 --> 33:35.263
We're not bringing some diseased corpse...

33:35.555 --> 33:36.765
I'm going.
- What?

33:37.807 --> 33:39.351
- L'm going.

33:39.643 --> 33:40.268
- Charles.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.355
You're panicking.

33:43.647 --> 33:46.358
- Don't talk to me about panic, Avis.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.276
Since day one this whole expedition

33:48.568 --> 33:50.028
has been a disaster.

33:51.738 --> 33:53.114
I'm leaving this forest,

33:53.406 --> 33:54.991
I'm leaving this god damn village

33:55.283 --> 33:57.410
and if you two tarts
wanna stick around here,

33:57.702 --> 33:58.828
scavenging around in the night

33:59.120 --> 34:01.122
for whatever in god's name killed him,

34:01.414 --> 34:03.750
be my guest, but I'm not bringing his rank

34:04.042 --> 34:06.670
or I'm not fighting his stupidity.

34:06.962 --> 34:08.170
I've done my job!

34:09.214 --> 34:11.841
Of everyone standing
here on this expedition,

34:12.132 --> 34:14.594
I'm the only one doing my job!

34:27.899 --> 34:31.235
- Stop, stop, take it back, take it back.

35:22.078 --> 35:22.954
- "SOS, stop.

35:23.913 --> 35:25.248
"SOS, stop.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.459
"Please send all vehicles to pick up women

35:27.751 --> 35:29.210
"and children, stop.

35:30.587 --> 35:33.757
"We are burning what we can, stop.

35:34.049 --> 35:36.509
"We are wearing the masks, stop.

35:37.927 --> 35:40.347
"It is inside of us, stop.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.766
"It is in our clothes, stop.

35:43.892 --> 35:45.727
"We are bleeding, stop.

35:47.228 --> 35:49.147
"We can't breathe, stop.

35:50.815 --> 35:51.650
"SOS, stop.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.235
"SOS, stop."

36:16.299 --> 36:17.050
- Charles!

36:19.094 --> 36:19.844
" Rudy!

36:20.845 --> 36:21.596
- Avis!

36:23.264 --> 36:24.015
- Charles!

36:25.350 --> 36:26.101
- Rudyard!

36:27.811 --> 36:29.562
- Avis!

36:29.854 --> 36:30.980
- Charles!

36:32.065 --> 36:33.650
- Rudyard!
- Rudyard!

37:04.347 --> 37:06.057
- Rudyard, get my medicine.
- On your bed?

37:06.349 --> 37:08.810
- Under my bed.
- What happened?

37:09.102 --> 37:13.064
- What in god's name?
- Ora, take my place.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.608
- What in god's name?

37:15.900 --> 37:17.360
- He left before us.
- What?

37:17.652 --> 37:18.778
- We got to the mill,
Charles left before us.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.155
We found him by the
river bank this morning.

37:20.447 --> 37:20.989
He slept on the forest floor.

37:21.281 --> 37:21.906
- Rudyard, we need to hold him down.

37:22.198 --> 37:23.700
Everybody get on his arms and legs.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.368
Matt, on his chest.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.620
Ora, tilt his head back.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.372
His throat's about to close
and if he stops breathing,

37:29.664 --> 37:31.040
he's gonna die, give me that.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.333
- Why don't you just knock him out?

37:32.625 --> 37:35.378
- I can't do that without
guaranteeing an airway first.

37:35.670 --> 37:36.421
- Anyone want to tell me what's wrong

37:36.713 --> 37:38.173
with sleeping on the forest floor?

37:38.465 --> 37:39.507
- The floor's covered in bacteria.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.801
It's leaves decomposing,
you can get sick from--

37:42.093 --> 37:42.927
- It's like a stomach.

37:43.219 --> 37:44.304
- Well, he's having
an allergic reaction

37:44.596 --> 37:45.555
to something he inhaled.

37:45.847 --> 37:48.057
Rudyard, pass me that bottle.

38:14.751 --> 38:16.836
- So, you got to the mill?

38:21.007 --> 38:22.675
- We got to the mill.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.982
- Based on Keating's notes,
the samples I've looked at,

38:38.274 --> 38:40.944
and the information Keating
had locked in his trunk,

38:41.236 --> 38:42.904
it appears the only things
living in this forest

38:43.196 --> 38:45.657
are plants, bacteria, and fungi.

38:48.243 --> 38:49.911
There are no animals.

38:51.871 --> 38:54.207
- How is that possible?

38:54.499 --> 38:56.125
- You heard of an endophyte?
- A what?

38:56.417 --> 38:58.503
- An endophyte, like fields
in Europe endophytes?

38:58.795 --> 39:00.046
- Yes.
- Where those cows were dying?

39:00.338 --> 39:01.422
- Sorry, what are we talking about here?

39:01.714 --> 39:03.132
- Afungi that makes plants inedible.

39:03.424 --> 39:05.176
- Right, except endophytes
are a grass fungi

39:05.468 --> 39:06.553
and they don't grow in trees.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.805
- Rudy, think about
it, it could explain--

39:09.097 --> 39:10.515
- What, Ora, are you gonna
tell me the entire forest

39:10.807 --> 39:12.225
is full of endophytic fungi?

39:12.517 --> 39:13.017
We've only surveyed an area--

39:13.309 --> 39:14.227
- Rudyard, we have Keating's notes

39:14.519 --> 39:16.604
and they are in everything
I put under a microscope.

39:16.896 --> 39:17.856
- Maybe you need a new microscope.

39:18.147 --> 39:20.525
- Rudyard, there are no
people living in this forest.

39:20.817 --> 39:21.943
Do you see any animals?

39:22.235 --> 39:25.029
There's no flora with any color,
nothing to allure insects!

39:25.321 --> 39:27.323
- And you jump to this!

39:27.615 --> 39:28.950
Ora, the forest's deciduous!

39:29.242 --> 39:30.910
How's it gonna live without animals?

39:31.202 --> 39:32.954
You morons are saying it drops its leaves,

39:33.246 --> 39:35.665
the bacteria, the fungi
breaks it all down, then what?

39:35.957 --> 39:37.750
Spring waters it anew and
the whole cycle starts over?

39:38.042 --> 39:39.419
- Closed ecosystem.

39:42.338 --> 39:43.089
No fauna.

39:45.133 --> 39:49.012
- This is some science-fiction.

39:49.304 --> 39:50.638
- Why didn't we see it?

39:50.930 --> 39:53.224
If this fungi is in everything,
why doesn't it show?

39:53.516 --> 39:57.020
- Because it hides inside the plants.

39:57.312 --> 40:02.025
The only way botanists have
caught it in the past is this.

40:02.317 --> 40:03.735
- What's that?

40:04.027 --> 40:06.821
- That is his hand.
- That's my hand.

40:08.197 --> 40:12.619
And I'm not moving it.

40:22.462 --> 40:23.296
- Staggers.

40:25.882 --> 40:27.050
Human staggers.

40:34.390 --> 40:37.852
- Endophytes attack an animal's
motor control, they cause,

40:38.144 --> 40:41.773
they first cause an
animal to tremor, stagger.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.192
- Followed by?

40:44.484 --> 40:49.113
- There's no documented cases
in humans, but in livestock,

40:49.405 --> 40:53.368
consuming or inhaling
endophytes results in death.

40:56.412 --> 40:57.538
- But the mill.

40:58.873 --> 41:02.418
- The mill closed down because
people started getting sick.

41:02.710 --> 41:06.214
Pollen in their hair, in
their clothes, in their lungs.

41:06.506 --> 41:08.132
- You must be joking.
- No.

41:08.424 --> 41:11.886
And this brilliance is why the
professor brought us up here.

41:12.178 --> 41:14.514
The man wanted to investigate
why a mill was abandoned

41:14.806 --> 41:15.890
because of the trees it was cutting down.

41:16.182 --> 41:17.183
- I'm sure Keating
didn't just bring us--

41:17.475 --> 41:18.434
- Rud, he did.

41:20.436 --> 41:25.274
We spent all of yesterday
combing through his trunk.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.902
The man knew what was up here.

41:28.945 --> 41:30.780
- So why did he burn our food?

41:31.072 --> 41:33.866
- Look at your clothes.

41:34.158 --> 41:35.118
It's all over.

41:39.122 --> 41:41.374
- And who knows what
state of mind he was in.

41:41.666 --> 41:42.750
' What?

41:43.042 --> 41:45.086
- He was out here for two weeks.

41:45.378 --> 41:46.254
- What do you think, he went crazy?

41:46.546 --> 41:49.340
- Why was he at the mill?
- Research!

41:53.219 --> 41:54.804
- How many days are we
from the nearest town?

41:55.096 --> 41:57.765
- Half a day's
paddling and then two by car.

41:58.057 --> 42:01.060
- Traveling at--
- 30 miles per hour.

42:01.352 --> 42:04.522
- So we're looking at 480 miles.

42:04.814 --> 42:07.817
That's about 21 days of walking.

42:08.109 --> 42:10.153
Three and a half weeks and
our next supply drop is in--

42:10.445 --> 42:11.988
- A month.

42:13.865 --> 42:18.786
- So short of finding some
way to turn water into food...

42:19.245 --> 42:22.165
We really are gonna starve out here.

42:30.798 --> 42:34.010
- Maybe not.

42:34.302 --> 42:36.888
Boiling anything will,
more often than not,

42:37.180 --> 42:41.267
kill any bacteria living
in or around a plant.

42:41.559 --> 42:42.435
Kidney beans.

42:43.936 --> 42:47.356
Eat 'em raw and you'll vomit for hours.

42:47.648 --> 42:48.524
But boil 'em?

42:48.816 --> 42:50.109
Not a wink.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.986
Then of course there are apple seeds,

42:52.278 --> 42:55.031
a handful of which will
kill you, cherries, peaches,

42:55.323 --> 42:58.493
plums, apricots and almond
leaves are all poisonous,

42:58.785 --> 43:00.536
everything but the stalk
of a rhubarb will put you

43:00.828 --> 43:04.415
into a coma and tomatoes are nightshades.

43:04.707 --> 43:07.960
You say that these killers are fungi, yes,

43:09.670 --> 43:11.672
so white vinegar.

43:11.964 --> 43:15.218
Most vinegar contains a mild acid.

43:15.510 --> 43:16.511
Cures toe fungus.

43:16.803 --> 43:20.014
- Are you suggesting that we
use cooking vinegar to save us?

43:20.306 --> 43:23.184
- No, I'm suggesting we
don't all panic, because all

43:23.476 --> 43:25.812
of a sudden we're surrounded
by poisonous plants.

43:26.104 --> 43:28.856
- Why not?
- Because we always have been.

43:29.148 --> 43:30.066
Humans are dominant on Earth

43:30.358 --> 43:32.110
because we never take what we get.

43:32.401 --> 43:36.697
We can cook, boil, fry
our way out of bacteria.

43:36.989 --> 43:37.615
- That's right, Ritz.

43:37.907 --> 43:41.828
- Alright, for all those
who didn't study botany.

43:42.120 --> 43:46.916
This is a rag weed, this is
the main cause of hay fever.

43:47.208 --> 43:49.669
- No, Rudyard, this is a plant,

43:51.504 --> 43:55.633
whose seeds happen to be
about 50% crude protein.

43:55.925 --> 43:57.969
- And you learned this studying whales?

43:58.261 --> 43:59.887
- I learnt this reading a book.

44:00.179 --> 44:03.182
- Haviland, you're talking
about poaching a bush that's

44:03.474 --> 44:06.936
notorious for causing the worst
allergies on the continent.

44:07.228 --> 44:09.730
You can't just eat wild plants,

44:10.022 --> 44:12.733
and hope everything turns out fine.

44:13.985 --> 44:16.654
- Then what do you wanna do, Rud?

44:16.946 --> 44:19.073
What do any of you wanna do?

44:19.365 --> 44:20.283
Wait here?

44:20.575 --> 44:21.617
Drink water?

44:21.909 --> 44:24.829
Conserve energy off of
two cans of tomatoes,

44:25.121 --> 44:27.707
and a couple of well-oiled sardines?

44:27.999 --> 44:30.126
- None of us are seeing it.

44:30.418 --> 44:33.254
- None of us are seeing what?

44:33.546 --> 44:37.383
- We have to run.

44:38.968 --> 44:39.719
- What?

44:41.387 --> 44:43.014
- These grasses are
going to start releasing,

44:43.306 --> 44:45.516
and along with these trees,
this forest is gonna fill

44:45.808 --> 44:49.520
with so much pollen, we won't
be able to open our eyes

44:49.812 --> 44:52.273
without it getting inside of us.

44:53.941 --> 44:56.736
We're not going to starve in these woods.

44:57.028 --> 44:59.572
We're going to suffocate.

44:59.864 --> 45:01.240
Charles, step one.

45:01.532 --> 45:02.825
Keating, step two.

45:04.410 --> 45:05.578
We have to run.

45:11.125 --> 45:13.586
So this is us, this is the
mill, and that is the road.

45:13.878 --> 45:14.420
- The road will take too long.

45:14.712 --> 45:15.588
- Well, what about the river here?

45:15.880 --> 45:16.756
- The river empties out of the lake,

45:17.048 --> 45:18.591
flows down into the canoe camp and then--

45:18.883 --> 45:20.426
- Hits a waterfall.
- Yeah, we saw it.

45:20.718 --> 45:22.220
- Right, so no paddling out that way.

45:22.511 --> 45:23.471
What about the other side?

45:23.763 --> 45:25.806
- Upstream.
- Right, and it's uncharted.

45:26.098 --> 45:28.267
- But if we travel by
water, we can stay hydrated.

45:28.559 --> 45:29.977
- Also carry Charles in one of the canoes.

45:30.269 --> 45:31.479
- And the water should trap the pollen.

45:31.771 --> 45:32.480
- Wash it off our skin.

45:32.772 --> 45:35.858
- You all do understand the
concept of uncharted, right?

45:36.150 --> 45:38.027
- No, is that a word, what is that?

45:38.319 --> 45:40.571
- Listen, we don't know
how far this forest goes.

45:40.863 --> 45:43.741
We could be paddling up
that thing for weeks.

45:44.033 --> 45:46.827
- What other option do we have?

45:47.119 --> 45:47.954
- The train.

45:48.246 --> 45:50.915
- What was that?
- What about the train?

45:51.207 --> 45:52.583
There's a train that passes through here,

45:52.875 --> 45:54.210
on its way from the bay going south.

45:54.502 --> 45:56.504
- Every two weeks.
- Every two weeks.

45:56.796 --> 45:59.048
- Strike me dead.
- How far is that?

45:59.340 --> 46:01.676
- Well, the tracks, from where we are,

46:01.968 --> 46:05.137
this map is a quadrangle and we are here.

46:06.430 --> 46:11.310
So that means it's about 200
kilometers, or about 120 miles.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.396
- If we're moving about 18 a day, then--

46:13.688 --> 46:15.189
- That's--
- A seven day trek.

46:15.481 --> 46:17.733
- A week, so if we got for that train,

46:18.025 --> 46:20.361
we could get out in a week.

46:20.653 --> 46:22.446
- But we'd have to go
straight through the woods.

46:22.738 --> 46:24.657
- And carry water and supplies.

46:24.949 --> 46:25.783
- Build suits.

46:26.075 --> 46:27.118
- We could use Keating's masks.

46:27.410 --> 46:29.870
- You'll have to cut your hair.

46:30.162 --> 46:30.788
- What?

46:31.831 --> 46:33.457
- It's too long.

46:33.749 --> 46:36.294
- Pollen would get trapped in it.

46:44.427 --> 46:46.345
<i>- Tomorrow, we scavenge.</i>

46:47.722 --> 46:51.100
Use Haviland's science,
then boil up everything,

46:51.392 --> 46:53.019
and test on ourselves.

47:01.068 --> 47:01.986
Then we run.

47:04.363 --> 47:05.448
- And Charles?

47:08.326 --> 47:09.493
- We carry him.

47:10.703 --> 47:13.873
Either he gets better, or we carry him.

49:02.773 --> 49:05.109
- So, we have noodles, jerky,

49:06.444 --> 49:09.697
pickles, spinach, and baby carrots.

49:09.989 --> 49:12.575
Also known as cattails,
pine bark, water lily root,

49:12.867 --> 49:14.869
wood nanals and rag weeds.

49:15.161 --> 49:18.205
Everything here should be edible.

49:18.497 --> 49:20.499
Doc, take it away.

49:20.791 --> 49:24.753
- Right, so none of us have
eaten anything since we woke.

49:25.045 --> 49:27.006
Which means that our bodies
are gonna react to this,

49:27.298 --> 49:29.091
and only this.

49:29.383 --> 49:31.802
So the way that you do
it is, you pick a plant,

49:32.094 --> 49:35.097
and then you hold it to
your lips and you wait.

49:35.389 --> 49:39.518
Any burning, tingling, just
stop, throw it out, torch it.

49:39.810 --> 49:44.106
But if not, then put the
plant on your tongue,

49:44.398 --> 49:45.900
and again, you wait.

49:46.192 --> 49:50.905
No biting, chewing, breaking
the leaf for about 10 seconds.

49:52.364 --> 49:55.326
And then, and only then, you chew.

49:55.618 --> 49:58.621
Do not swallow, just chew and wait.

49:58.913 --> 50:02.500
After a few seconds, then
if everything is still jake,

50:02.791 --> 50:04.293
you swallow.

50:04.585 --> 50:06.545
Then over the next eight
hours, we see what happens.

50:06.837 --> 50:10.174
And if by this evening
everything is still okay,

50:10.466 --> 50:13.010
then we try the plants again,
and by tomorrow morning,

50:13.302 --> 50:16.138
we will know for sure, and that's it.

50:18.766 --> 50:19.892
<i>'</i> That's it?

50:20.184 --> 50:21.477
- Yeah, that's it.

50:22.561 --> 50:25.898
And if any of us does get sick,
we have some bowls nearby.

50:26.190 --> 50:27.983
So aim for that.

50:28.275 --> 50:30.653
We could leave some nice
samples for the university.

50:30.945 --> 50:34.698
Give 'em a nice thank you
for treating us so kindly.

50:34.990 --> 50:36.825
Also, I have some ipecac,
some sal volatile,

50:37.117 --> 50:39.828
some salt water nearby,
and some clean water, so--

50:40.120 --> 50:41.747
- So let's start this.

50:55.302 --> 50:56.053
- Alright.

50:58.430 --> 50:59.765
I'll do the pine.

51:15.197 --> 51:15.948
Nothing.

51:35.551 --> 51:36.302
Bitter.

51:38.679 --> 51:40.264
- Pardon?

51:40.556 --> 51:42.182
- Bitter, it's bitter.

52:00.451 --> 52:01.535
Right.

52:01.827 --> 52:02.453
Next?

52:05.122 --> 52:06.540
- Well, I'll take the lily pad.

52:06.832 --> 52:08.292
- Nettles.
- Cattail.

52:11.295 --> 52:12.046
- Well...

52:13.088 --> 52:15.591
Guess it's me and the rag weed.

53:02.096 --> 53:02.846
- Matt?

53:04.848 --> 53:06.433
Matt, are you sure about this?

53:06.725 --> 53:07.601
- Yes.
- Sure?

53:08.602 --> 53:09.645
- Do you hear me?

53:09.937 --> 53:12.981
Everything I've tested, what
we just ate, is endophytic.

53:13.273 --> 53:14.983
- Why are you asking this, Rudyard?

53:15.275 --> 53:18.070
- Why? Because I don't feel a thing.

53:19.279 --> 53:22.408
The whole damn experiment's based on...

53:22.700 --> 53:24.451
- Based on what, Rudyard?

53:24.743 --> 53:28.539
Don't shut up now.

53:44.138 --> 53:45.681
- Avis!
- Avis!

53:51.979 --> 53:55.149
- Rudyard, I need you to drink this.

53:55.441 --> 53:58.026
Put his head back, put his head back!

53:58.318 --> 53:59.069
Breathe through your nose, Rudyard.

53:59.361 --> 54:01.321
Breathe through your nose.

54:03.240 --> 54:04.908
Turn him on his side!

54:15.169 --> 54:16.336
No, no, no, no, no!

54:16.628 --> 54:17.963
No, Rud, no!

54:18.255 --> 54:20.591
No, no, I need a towel!
- What?

54:20.883 --> 54:22.718
- A towel, it's corrosive!
- What are you doing?

54:23.010 --> 54:24.928
Haviland, what are you doing?
- It's burning his throat!

54:25.220 --> 54:26.555
- No, stop!
- The air's not getting in!

54:26.847 --> 54:28.140
- No, stop!

55:19.399 --> 55:21.318
- Nine hours till we go.

55:25.739 --> 55:27.574
- How's Charles?

55:32.621 --> 55:33.372
- Worse.

55:35.541 --> 55:37.167
- You?

55:37.459 --> 55:38.168
- I'm fine.

55:41.213 --> 55:42.381
How's Haviland?

55:45.717 --> 55:50.305
- I can see his lamp flash
sometimes, between the trees.

55:56.436 --> 55:58.814
- Can I ask you something?

55:59.106 --> 55:59.731
- Yes.

56:01.024 --> 56:03.026
- You know cowbane?

56:03.318 --> 56:04.278
Water hemlock?

56:05.946 --> 56:10.117
15 minutes from ingestion,
it's vomiting, seizures.

56:13.161 --> 56:14.746
Then cardiac arrest.

56:17.916 --> 56:19.376
Those nettles acted like one of the most

56:19.668 --> 56:21.628
poisonous plants on Earth.

56:22.838 --> 56:26.341
There with ipecac roots or cinnamon.

56:26.633 --> 56:31.430
Vomiting, convulsions and then
burning like a hog weed sap.

56:31.763 --> 56:34.391
And Charles is like a drip poison.

56:34.683 --> 56:37.477
Soporific and inflammatory
and these staggers are like

56:37.769 --> 56:42.232
contractions and I don't know,
I can't find cross-symptoms.

56:42.524 --> 56:46.069
Matt, there could be allergies
in all of us, inconsistencies

56:46.361 --> 56:50.365
in the time of year that
the plants were picked.

56:50.657 --> 56:52.534
And the fact that the leaves
were ingested instead of

56:52.826 --> 56:55.245
the roots or the stalks
and I just don't, Charles--

56:55.537 --> 56:57.998
- Avis, stop.
- I'm not a doctor!

57:02.794 --> 57:04.546
My father is a doctor.

57:08.967 --> 57:10.886
They won't let me train.

57:26.443 --> 57:30.322
- My father was Japanese infantry.

57:30.614 --> 57:31.239
In Aomori.

57:34.952 --> 57:38.372
My father doesn't want me to study botany.

57:38.664 --> 57:41.625
My father doesn't know what botany is.

57:46.630 --> 57:48.215
My father is a fool.

57:51.510 --> 57:52.260
I am not.

57:54.721 --> 57:59.518
You are not.

57:59.810 --> 58:01.436
And they are not here.

58:07.401 --> 58:11.238
- "Suddenly, the humor of the
situation came into my mind.

58:11.530 --> 58:14.741
"The thought of the years I
had spent in study and in toil

58:15.033 --> 58:17.077
"to get into the future age,

58:17.369 --> 58:21.289
"and now my passion of
anxiety to get out of it.

58:21.581 --> 58:23.875
"L had made myself the most
complicated and the most

58:24.167 --> 58:27.295
"hopeless trap that ever a man devised."

59:04.416 --> 59:06.543
- We're almost ready.

59:06.835 --> 59:09.463
Avis is just finishing up Ora now.

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:08.188
- Ora Blackwood, meet 1929.

01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:08.339
- We need to talk about Charles.

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:13.761
He's not getting any better.

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.268
- What are you saying?

01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:26.232
What is Avis telling you to say?

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:30.403
- Ora, I haven't been able
to give him any water.

01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:37.076
His digestive system has
been slowly shutting down.

01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:39.287
Not pulling the tube out, he
would die within two days.

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:40.455
- Avis.

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:44.584
- We don't have time.

01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:48.922
- So we leave him?

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:51.758
Pull out his tube, let him choke?

01:06:57.805 --> 01:06:59.641
Is there any other way?

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.021
- Ora.

01:07:06.648 --> 01:07:08.066
It's already done.

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:45.228
- I think I can see a break in the trees.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.145
- Where?

01:07:48.106 --> 01:07:49.190
- Turn.

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:50.108
Northwest.

01:07:51.818 --> 01:07:52.652
You see it?

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:54.737
- Yeah.

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:56.573
Maybe a path?

01:07:56.864 --> 01:07:59.576
It's too close to be the train yet.

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:02.829
Hello.

01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:06.958
- What do you see?

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.668
- A pine forest.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.086
- A pine forest?

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:12.964
- Is that interesting?

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:14.382
- A pine forest.

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:18.051
Pine trees produce a lot of
pollen, but they do it quickly,

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:20.095
and their needles
contain an acid that kill

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:21.639
all other deciduous flora.

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:23.224
- In a pine forest, we'd be free

01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:25.018
from the rest of the
plants in these woods.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.562
- It's like an oasis.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:29.647
- Well, how far is that?

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:34.319
- It looks like two days from here.

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:38.573
- So, we head there, finish
packing and make pace.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:50.542
- Tell me.

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:56.049
Does this look like death to you?

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:00.136
- No.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:03.389
It looks like life.

01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:07.143
- The strongest I've ever seen.

01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:08.765
Run!

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:23.214
It's herbaceous, Matt, shrub
understory and then canape.

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:25.550
There's no way you're
convincing me that shrub is more

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:28.594
complex than something
working at a canape level.

01:12:28.886 --> 01:12:30.763
It's not like we didn't pay for it.

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:32.557
- My entire torso's in bandages.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:35.142
- Don't exaggerate.
- I'm not exaggerating!

01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:37.061
- You're exaggerating.

01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:43.234
- Matt.

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:44.151
Your mask.

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:55.162
Everything's dry.

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:56.080
Jake.

01:12:58.416 --> 01:12:59.166
Haviland.

01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:02.253
- Yes, doc.

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:03.921
- Your mask.

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:17.184
- Avis, look at me.

01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:19.604
- What?
- Look at me.

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:21.939
- What is it, sheik?

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.524
- Check your nose.

01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:27.695
- Yeah.

01:13:29.363 --> 01:13:31.574
It's fine, it's dry.

01:13:31.866 --> 01:13:33.159
- It's dry?
- Yeah.

01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:35.703
Perfect.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.498
- Avis.

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:40.416
- Yeah?

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.085
- I've watched you bandage all of us.

01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:45.713
I barely see you doing yourself.

01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:48.090
We're not making it far without a doctor.

01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:50.176
- I'm a nurse, Haviland.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:53.012
- Sure.

01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:57.308
Just take care of yourself.

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:12.401
- Avis, wake up!

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:13.319
Avis!

01:16:14.278 --> 01:16:16.697
Avis!

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.910
- Avis, Avis!

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:47.872
Avis, wake up, wake up, wake up, Avis!

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:48.789
Wake up!

01:17:49.707 --> 01:17:53.460
Avis, please wake up, wake up, wake up.

01:17:53.752 --> 01:17:56.046
Haviland, she's not breathing!

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:00.176
No.

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:02.928
- Avis.

01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:04.096
Avis!

01:18:04.388 --> 01:18:05.764
Avis!
- Where's Matt?

01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:07.183
- Come on.

01:18:07.474 --> 01:18:09.435
Come on, Avis.
- Where's Matt?

01:18:09.727 --> 01:18:11.520
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:18:11.812 --> 01:18:13.022
- Where's Matt?

01:18:13.314 --> 01:18:14.231
- Did you see
him anywhere along the path?

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:15.816
" No!

01:18:16.108 --> 01:18:17.943
- Jesus, I just
told her this morning she--

01:18:18.235 --> 01:18:20.738
- Haviland, we need to--
- I know!

01:18:24.825 --> 01:18:26.285
- He was right behind me.

01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:28.454
- Well, when was
the last time you checked?

01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:29.788
- I don't know!

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:35.461
- We go for the forest.
- What?

01:18:35.753 --> 01:18:37.463
- We keep goin', we get
to that pine forest.

01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:38.464
- What?

01:18:38.756 --> 01:18:40.716
- We make him find us.

01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:43.260
- Are you insane?
- I am not insane.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:45.554
It's a half a day's trek,
Matt knows where it is.

01:18:45.846 --> 01:18:48.182
- Haviland, he could be dying
on the ground somewhere.

01:18:48.474 --> 01:18:50.434
- He is stubborn
and I guarantee you he is just

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:52.728
off path and he could be trying
to find his way back to us.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.314
- But what if he's lost?
- He's not lost, Ora.

01:18:55.606 --> 01:18:57.608
He is just off the path.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:01.528
Now we have a heading and
we need to keep moving,

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:04.365
or else we don't get out of here.

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:06.825
Matt Will find us!

01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:07.428
- Did you come to sleep?

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.346
We're all sleeping in the woods tonight.

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.515
My hammock is over there.

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:19.315
Where is your hammock, near the mill?

01:20:25.404 --> 01:20:29.658
I like your mask, I
wish mine wasn't so big.

01:20:52.556 --> 01:20:53.307
- Matt!

01:20:56.852 --> 01:20:58.020
Matt.

01:21:01.106 --> 01:21:02.024
- We.

01:21:02.316 --> 01:21:03.150
Don't.

01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:04.693
Need.

01:21:04.985 --> 01:21:06.153
You, Matt.

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:08.238
We live stronger, alone!

01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:43.315
- Should have gone up that river.

01:21:46.527 --> 01:21:47.152
What?

01:22:02.793 --> 01:22:04.837
- I'm coming!
- No, you're not.

01:22:05.129 --> 01:22:06.171
- Haviland, you can't stop me!

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:07.965
- You spent all clay blowing that whistle,

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:10.008
not protecting yourself,
if you go out there now,

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:13.929
you won't make it four
yards before you collapse.

01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:16.890
I will be back here by morning.

01:22:17.182 --> 01:22:20.477
I will find him and we will
get out of here together.

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:22.438
But I need someone to be here,

01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:24.857
in case I miss him in the dark.

01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:27.985
- Haviland...

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:32.739
If you're not back here by
morning, I'm coming out there.

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:34.741
- Ora.

01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:35.909
I'll be here.

01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:11.361
I'll see you soon.

01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:24.685
- Haviland!

01:24:33.819 --> 01:24:34.570
Haviland!

01:24:45.706 --> 01:24:46.456
Haviland!

01:24:59.886 --> 01:25:00.512
Haviland!

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:00.822
- I found him.

01:26:02.741 --> 01:26:03.992
- You found him.

01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:08.664
- His mask was off, lost.

01:26:13.752 --> 01:26:15.754
- You gave him your mask?

01:26:18.298 --> 01:26:19.383
- Ora, please.

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:26.598
If I make it through this,

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:30.560
you're never gonna sketch my rocks.

01:26:37.275 --> 01:26:40.028
- Haviland, you're coming with me.

01:26:48.286 --> 01:26:49.955
- I brought him back.

01:26:52.332 --> 01:26:54.418
I brought my brother back.

01:29:09.427 --> 01:29:10.178
- Don't.

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:19.938
I'm not going.

01:29:20.230 --> 01:29:21.356
Ora, Ora.

01:29:21.648 --> 01:29:24.734
Ora, you've lost a day,
it's two more to the train.

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:29.406
It's supposed to be passing
tomorrow and you have to run.

01:29:29.698 --> 01:29:31.074
And I can't.
- Yes, you can!

01:29:31.366 --> 01:29:32.284
Matt, let go of me!

01:29:32.576 --> 01:29:33.451
Matt, let go!

01:29:34.369 --> 01:29:35.036
Matt!

01:29:35.328 --> 01:29:35.954
<i>'</i> Ora!

01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:47.716
You have to go and show them this.

01:29:52.429 --> 01:29:54.598
We don't know how it works.

01:29:55.891 --> 01:29:59.477
We study all this and
make up growth levels.

01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:03.690
We don't know how it thinks.

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:04.858
Why it grows.

01:30:07.527 --> 01:30:08.612
It's like you.

01:30:10.655 --> 01:30:11.573
Frightening.

01:30:12.991 --> 01:30:13.742
Wild.

01:30:16.494 --> 01:30:17.245
Beautiful.

01:30:22.876 --> 01:30:26.588
It's not forcing us out, it's living.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.089
Stronger than us.

01:30:30.884 --> 01:30:32.385
We have to meet it.

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:38.016
You have to meet it.

01:30:58.161 --> 01:30:59.496
Get to the train.

01:31:01.247 --> 01:31:02.999
Get to the university.

01:31:04.417 --> 01:31:05.168
Then...

01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:08.421
Come find us.
