00:00.542 --> 00:03.378
Previously on Legacies...
If I’m gonna be a vampire,

00:03.378 --> 00:06.215
feed me blood,
feed me whatever it takes.

00:06.215 --> 00:08.884
There you go. MG, dude’s not
that big, okay? That’s enough.

00:08.884 --> 00:10.260
(blade stabs)

00:10.260 --> 00:11.428
DORIAN:
A ripper

00:11.428 --> 00:14.389
is a vampire who
is driven by obsession.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.141
And do you know what kind
of vamps are susceptible,

00:16.141 --> 00:17.351
I’d say an impressionable,

00:17.351 --> 00:18.393
horny little kid

00:18.393 --> 00:21.021
like Milton Greasley.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.690
Who are your parents?
My mom’s name is Seylah.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.234
Gave me up for adoption
when I was young.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.401
You wanted to find answers

00:26.401 --> 00:28.195
about who or what you are.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.279
I want those answers, too.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.530
LANDON:
Thanks again

00:30.530 --> 00:33.408
for coming to help me.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.160
Sorry you didn’t
find your mother.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.245
What did you want
to talk to me about?

00:36.245 --> 00:38.914
I’m really happy
that you’re back.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.999
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

00:40.999 --> 00:43.835
LANDON:
I’d really like that.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.130
(insects trilling)

00:51.343 --> 00:53.262
(snaps fingers)
Dr. S.

00:53.262 --> 00:54.930
Kaleb. We just killed a mummy

00:54.930 --> 00:56.932
and spent six hours in a van
together, and I’m not sure...

00:56.932 --> 00:58.976
I can’t find MG.
What do you mean?

00:58.976 --> 01:01.645
I just checked in with his hall
monitor, but he missed curfew.

01:01.645 --> 01:02.896
Monitor said
he tried calling you.

01:04.648 --> 01:06.984
Ah, that guy from Triad
Enterprises took my phone.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.110
All right, whatever.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.444
We... we got to find him.

01:09.444 --> 01:10.946
This ain’t the
night for vampires

01:10.946 --> 01:12.239
to be walking
around unchecked.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.244
HOPE:
Have you seen Landon?

01:17.244 --> 01:19.955
I thought he might down here
with Raf for moral support.

01:19.955 --> 01:21.415
Raf’s not here.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.541
Wait, he’s... What?
The supervisors

01:22.541 --> 01:24.126
said he didn’t check in.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.877
And now MG’s missing, too.

01:25.877 --> 01:28.171
But it’s a full moon.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.756
(howling in distance)

01:33.010 --> 01:34.970
Oh, God.

01:34.970 --> 01:37.723
HOPE: I don’t know why
my locator spell didn’t work.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.683
If you can’t find them, it means
they’re being cloaked or...

01:39.683 --> 01:40.976
Or they’re dead.
I’m aware.
What would possess them

01:40.976 --> 01:42.769
to leave campus?
Why would they be

01:42.769 --> 01:44.980
so irresponsible?
They wouldn’t. Something
must have happened.

01:46.982 --> 01:47.899
Hope.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.319
Raf? Raf!

01:51.403 --> 01:52.529
Hey, are you okay?

01:52.529 --> 01:55.741
MG... Landon...

01:55.741 --> 01:57.409
Hey, what’s going on?
Where’s Landon?

01:59.202 --> 02:01.079
I can’t remember.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.468
(breath trembling)

02:17.846 --> 02:19.306
Lunar psychosis?

02:19.306 --> 02:20.432
That’s a thing?

02:20.432 --> 02:21.475
Quit talking.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.560
Making noise.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.978
(low grunting)

02:26.480 --> 02:27.814
(growls)
(gasps)

02:27.814 --> 02:30.233
Tardus pulsatio.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.194
(amplified heartbeat)

02:32.194 --> 02:33.445
(low panting)

02:35.113 --> 02:37.783
It’s a thing.
What did you do to him?

02:37.783 --> 02:39.993
It’s okay. I’m just
slowing down his heart.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.453
It will calm him.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.955
(amplified heartbeat continues)

02:45.248 --> 02:47.334
What’s happening to me?

02:48.335 --> 02:50.128
I keep...

02:50.128 --> 02:52.005
losing time.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.215
As I said...

02:53.215 --> 02:54.716
lunar psychosis,

02:54.716 --> 02:56.968
which means that your
mind is in flux,

02:56.968 --> 02:58.095
trapped between...

02:58.095 --> 03:00.222
your wolf and human states,

03:00.222 --> 03:01.473
making it harder
to bridge the gap

03:01.473 --> 03:03.308
and access your memories
like you normally would.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.518
It’s very rare.

03:05.602 --> 03:06.895
It only happens

03:06.895 --> 03:08.605
after a premature reversion.

03:08.605 --> 03:12.234
So something caused
your body to shift back

03:12.234 --> 03:14.736
before the full moon was over,
leaving you like this.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.738
Wh-What kind of something?

03:16.738 --> 03:19.825
Usually trauma.
Something bad happened.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.284
We don’t know that.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.245
Three of them left,
and only one came back.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.830
Something bad happened.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.081
(sighs):
Hope...

03:26.081 --> 03:28.125
why don’t you give us a minute?

03:28.125 --> 03:30.794
Go on and check on
the other wolves.
I’m worried about this one.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.004
Hope... please.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.053
(scoffs)

03:47.936 --> 03:51.064
(breath trembling)

03:53.150 --> 03:55.110
What’s the danger of him
turning wolf again?

03:55.110 --> 03:57.779
I mean, this whole wing is
filled with sleeping vampires.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.364
Don’t worry,
I’ll keep him sealed in.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.574
What his mind needs now

04:00.574 --> 04:02.284
is to be surrounded
by all the things

04:02.284 --> 04:05.662
that are familiar to him, that
connect him to his humanity,

04:05.662 --> 04:07.414
not his lycanthropy.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.084
Corum spiritus.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.630
Rafael,

04:15.630 --> 04:17.048
we’ll do everything
we can to help you,

04:17.048 --> 04:19.134
but you need to tell us
exactly what happened.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.303
You were supposed
to be here on campus

04:21.303 --> 04:23.096
for spring break
with Landon and MG,

04:23.096 --> 04:24.639
and now we can’t find
either one of them.

04:24.639 --> 04:27.058
(exhales)

04:31.146 --> 04:33.899
(distorted, echoing):
Everyone was leaving.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.903
Heading home for spring break.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.405
All right, everyone, listen up.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.158
Absolutely no one leaves campus

04:43.158 --> 04:47.329
unless you’re in the custody
of your guardian.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.456
Now, with the full moon
approaching,

04:49.456 --> 04:53.126
this rule especially applies
to our wolves.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.252
Now, you know the drill.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.463
Vampires to your dorms.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.590
Wolves to your bunkers.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.259
Absolutely no exceptions.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.386
Just because we have a cure
for werewolf bites

05:03.386 --> 05:05.138
doesn’t mean
they won’t hurt like hell.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.141
Now, for those of you
who are staying behind,

05:08.141 --> 05:10.644
we have some activities planned
to ensure that your...

05:10.644 --> 05:12.103
vacation will be the...

05:13.897 --> 05:15.273
...dopest,

05:15.273 --> 05:16.525
coldest...

05:16.525 --> 05:18.193
spring break ever!

05:18.193 --> 05:21.029
(laughter)
All right, here’s MG, everybody.

05:22.197 --> 05:25.408
Are your mom and dad... dead?

05:25.408 --> 05:27.244
No place for you
in human society?

05:27.244 --> 05:30.163
Does being alone
leave you triggered?

05:30.163 --> 05:33.208
If your answer to any of these
questions is yes, it’s okay.

05:33.208 --> 05:35.794
The Holiday Committee
has your back.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.213
(quietly):
Hey, bro.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.297
(MG continues indistinctly)

05:39.297 --> 05:41.967
I need you to
do me a favor.

05:41.967 --> 05:45.303
Can you look after him while I’m
gone on this trip with Dr. S.?

05:45.303 --> 05:47.973
MG’s doing this little
"happy act" thing, but...

05:47.973 --> 05:50.225
he gets really weird
around holidays.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.726
Why?

05:51.726 --> 05:53.228
His family...

05:53.228 --> 05:55.939
they... they
never invite him home.

05:55.939 --> 05:59.234
So, you know, just...
hit up his little events

05:59.234 --> 06:01.152
and...
(groans softly):
Mm.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.738
Come on, man,
it’s-it’s the least you can do.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.448
Especially
after getting down and dirty

06:05.448 --> 06:06.783
with the love of his life.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.787
Oh, yeah,
everybody knows.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.290
Yeah, them, too.
They know.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.292
(sighs)

06:16.918 --> 06:18.795
So...
All right, uh,

06:18.795 --> 06:19.963
whatever, bro.

06:19.963 --> 06:22.007
Me and... and Lan
will hang with your boy,

06:22.007 --> 06:23.341
all right?

06:23.341 --> 06:26.094
It’s not like we have
anything else to do.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.268
MG:
Survey says--
you just got owned.

06:33.268 --> 06:36.313
Don’t be mad.
This stuff is in my blood.

06:36.313 --> 06:37.564
My dad’s a trivia god.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.441
We play games like this
all the time.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.443
Uh, we used to.

06:41.443 --> 06:43.278
You know, before the...

06:44.779 --> 06:46.781
Wait, so let me
get this straight.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.617
You died

06:48.617 --> 06:51.453
and then became a vampire,
and then your dad just...

06:51.453 --> 06:52.495
ghosted you?

06:52.495 --> 06:54.247
Pretty much.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.458
Uh, I hear from my mom
all the time,

06:56.458 --> 06:57.459
and she just says, like,

06:57.459 --> 06:59.377
he’s busy.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.504
Um, either way,
we don’t talk.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.380
Well, maybe you should.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.465
RAFAEL:
Or maybe some things

07:03.465 --> 07:06.009
are better left unsaid,
right, Lan?

07:06.009 --> 07:07.510
Sure. But, I mean,
the whole point

07:07.510 --> 07:09.220
of having a family
is so you can...

07:09.220 --> 07:10.847
be an actual family.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.475
Talk about stuff.
Look, what I’m
trying to say is,

07:13.475 --> 07:15.226
if you want answers...

07:15.226 --> 07:16.978
I hope you get them.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.355
Because I would
do anything

07:18.355 --> 07:20.398
to avoid another round
of Faction Feud.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.485
ALARIC:
No.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.904
Please tell me you
didn’t take MG home.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.572
We didn’t think it was
that big of a deal,

07:27.572 --> 07:28.990
Dr. Saltzman.
(exhales)

07:28.990 --> 07:30.617
They’re just right over
the state line in Maryland.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.619
We were supposed to make it back
before the full moon...

07:32.619 --> 07:33.912
Yeah, well, you didn’t.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.622
And now we’re here.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.998
Ric.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.500
Discipline can come

07:38.500 --> 07:39.876
after everyone
is healthy and safe.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.045
Rafael, I am sorry.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.797
I am not mad at you.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.549
I’m mad at myself.
For what?

07:46.549 --> 07:48.760
I got to go. I’ve got
a big mess I need to clean up.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.886
Hope, stay with Emma.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.388
Keep me posted
on what you learn, okay?

07:51.388 --> 07:53.682
I’ll have
the school phone on me.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.394
(knocking on door)

07:57.394 --> 07:59.104
(sighs)

07:59.104 --> 08:00.271
What’s up?

08:03.775 --> 08:05.360
What?

08:05.360 --> 08:06.403
Uh...
(clears throat)

08:06.403 --> 08:08.279
Did you find my boy?
Uh, no.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.115
I thought you said--
and I quote--

08:10.115 --> 08:11.449
"Everything’ll
be fine.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.701
I’ll handle it."

08:12.701 --> 08:14.661
Yeah. That’s why I’m here.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.079
I need your help.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.330
And so does MG.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.835
What’s with the needles?

08:21.835 --> 08:22.836
Sedatives.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.421
Sleep isn’t really
a priority.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.672
But safety is.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.424
Rafael told me

08:27.424 --> 08:28.967
why you couldn’t track them.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.927
Penelope Park aided them
in a cloaking spell

08:30.927 --> 08:32.429
before she left for break.

08:32.429 --> 08:36.641
Said it was gift for dumping
Lizzie on her birthday.

08:36.641 --> 08:38.476
HOPE: Great. Then
what happened?

08:40.228 --> 08:42.564
MG:
For the record, I didn’t know

08:42.564 --> 08:44.274
that grand theft auto
was a part of the plan.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.443
No, it’s not stealing
if you return it.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.528
MG: Yeah, well,
tell that to Dr. Saltzman.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.531
You got some vicious
street gangs around here.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.783
Why do you think we
parked in an alleyway?

08:53.783 --> 08:56.119
Everyone thinks I’m dead.
I can’t be seen here.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.121
You never mentioned
your dad was a politician.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.330
MG:
He’s not.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.832
At least he wasn’t.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.083
He’s running for mayor?

09:02.083 --> 09:04.377
Maybe Raf’s right--
maybe this is a mistake.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.963
No, the truth is
never a mistake.

09:08.590 --> 09:11.551
(sighs) Took me a long
time to figure that out.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.804
RAFAEL:
Landon!

09:14.804 --> 09:16.055
No!

09:16.055 --> 09:17.557
It’s happening again.
Hand me the syringe.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.309
Wait, he’s about to tell us
what happened to Landon.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.060
And if he stays
in this state any longer,

09:21.060 --> 09:22.562
it’ll be that much harder
to pull him out.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.481
Landon! Run!

09:24.481 --> 09:27.859
(Rafael grunting, panting)

09:27.859 --> 09:30.528
Raf! Hey, it’s okay.
Tell me

09:30.528 --> 09:31.863
who’s running after Landon.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.865
Please. Who’s chasing Landon?

09:34.991 --> 09:36.075
HOPE: Hey,
hey, hey...

09:36.075 --> 09:37.786
(grunts)

09:39.537 --> 09:40.997
(exhales)

09:43.166 --> 09:45.043
A monster.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.761
It doesn’t make any sense.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.679
Triad has the urn.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.014
There shouldn’t be
any more monsters,

09:58.014 --> 10:00.016
certainly none that made
their way through Maryland.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.142
He’s obviously confused.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.102
We need to wake him up.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.146
Sleep is the safest thing
for him right now.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.606
Once he’s out of
this lunar cycle,

10:06.606 --> 10:08.650
we’ll be able to recalibrate
his brain more easily.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.819
But he’s the only one who knows
where Landon and MG are.

10:10.819 --> 10:11.903
Plus, monster?

10:11.903 --> 10:13.738
I heard.
But as the closest thing

10:13.738 --> 10:15.323
this school has
to a psychiatrist,

10:15.323 --> 10:17.033
my responsibility is to him.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.034
And to you.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.369
You and I talked

10:19.369 --> 10:21.621
a lot about triggers
rooted in trauma.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.082
I don’t need a therapist
right now, Emma. I need answers.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.750
And you’ll get them when I do,

10:25.750 --> 10:26.876
causing the least
amount of harm

10:26.876 --> 10:28.670
to Rafael as possible.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.797
(exhales)

10:33.007 --> 10:36.344
MRS. GREASLEY:
I’m sorry, who are you
and why are you here?

10:39.347 --> 10:41.641
Uh, hi, Mom.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.892
Milton.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.353
I wasn’t expecting you.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.896
It’s spring break.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.314
Yes, I know. But
I thought we agreed

10:48.314 --> 10:50.024
it would be best for
you to stay on campus.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.318
Well...
Uh, Mrs. Greasley,

10:52.318 --> 10:54.195
hi. I’m Landon

10:54.195 --> 10:55.697
Kirby.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.699
Uh, my brother
Rafael and I,

10:57.699 --> 10:58.908
we’re new
at the school,

10:58.908 --> 11:00.285
and-and we didn’t
really have anywhere to go

11:00.285 --> 11:02.453
for spring break,
so we sort of...

11:02.453 --> 11:07.041
uh, talked your son into
a spontaneous road trip.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.294
Which now seems like it may
have been a hasty decision.

11:10.879 --> 11:13.590
We obviously came
at-at the wrong time,

11:13.590 --> 11:16.301
so I’ll just say hi to Dad,
uh, and we’ll be on our way.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.302
Where’s he at?

11:17.302 --> 11:19.095
Your father is not here.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.388
He’s...

11:20.388 --> 11:23.057
Running for mayor.

11:23.057 --> 11:25.435
The governor thinks
he has a great shot at winning.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.186
Y’all know the governor now?

11:27.186 --> 11:29.898
A lot has changed since you...

11:29.898 --> 11:31.149
died.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.151
Yeah.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.111
I can see that.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.989
You know we love you very much,
Milton.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.908
But the world
thinks you’re dead.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.451
If someone were to see you
walking around

11:41.451 --> 11:42.952
in your old hometown...
Then let us in.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.996
I just want to see Dad.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.210
Your father doesn’t want
to see you.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.129
His faith is
everything to him.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.923
And you know

11:54.923 --> 11:56.966
there’s no room in his belief
system for people dying

11:56.966 --> 11:58.384
and coming back to life.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.011
Except for Jesus.

12:00.011 --> 12:01.429
And Lazarus.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.354
He’ll come around.

12:09.354 --> 12:13.107
It’s just gonna take some time
for him to get used to the idea.

12:14.692 --> 12:17.153
That’s his loss then.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.155
Let’s-let’s just go, man.
Come on.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.616
Come on.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.050
Damn.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.719
When you said MG going home
would be catastrophic,

12:41.719 --> 12:43.304
I expected Chernobyl,

12:43.304 --> 12:45.014
not Wisteria Lane.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.308
Yeah, well, looks
can be deceiving.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.895
Just... let me do the talking.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.064
(clears throat)

12:53.064 --> 12:54.440
(exhales)

13:00.154 --> 13:02.073
Dr. Saltzman.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.992
Veronica.
(clears throat)

13:03.992 --> 13:05.702
I’m Kaleb.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.996
I assume you’re here
to apologize for my son

13:07.996 --> 13:09.580
showing up
yesterday.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.792
Actually, we’re here because
he never returned to school.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.335
He’s gone missing
and...

13:14.335 --> 13:16.921
we’re afraid he contacted
his father.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.798
Well, I can assure you
that didn’t happen.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.925
MR. GREASLEY:
Veronica, who’s at the door?

13:20.925 --> 13:21.926
Uh, just a solicitor, dear.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.428
I’ll be right in.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.181
So where’d MG go?

13:27.181 --> 13:28.474
I don’t know.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.059
But you’re gonna find him.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.728
We may not be able to
have him here with us,

13:31.728 --> 13:33.062
but he was supposed

13:33.062 --> 13:35.064
to be safe at
your school.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.274
We had an arrangement,

13:36.274 --> 13:39.068
and I expect you
to uphold it.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.282
An arrangement, huh?

13:44.282 --> 13:47.243
Good thing that
don’t sound suspicious.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.078
Hello?

13:49.078 --> 13:50.455
Why’d you bring
me all this way

13:50.455 --> 13:52.081
if you’re not gonna
tell me anything?

13:52.081 --> 13:53.082
Did you find them?

13:53.082 --> 13:54.250
No, not yet.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.418
What did you learn?

13:55.418 --> 13:56.961
Raf said they
got attacked by a monster.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.129
Well, that’s
impossible.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.130
Is it?
Where?

13:59.130 --> 14:00.298
And when?
I-I don’t know.

14:00.298 --> 14:02.091
I don’t know.
Emma sedated him,

14:02.091 --> 14:04.052
and he’s been sleeping it off
for hours.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.887
But I have an idea.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.472
It’s a family recipe
from my mom’s side,

14:07.472 --> 14:08.848
the Crescent Pack.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.391
Because they could control
their turns at will,

14:10.391 --> 14:12.518
they had access
to both sides of their minds.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.020
All right, well,
do what you need to do.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.314
I’ve got to find MG
before his father sees him.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.071
EMMA:
Absolutely not.

14:23.071 --> 14:26.240
This elixir has been
in my family for years.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.492
Dr. Saltzman
said that I...

14:27.492 --> 14:29.994
Dr. Saltzman, bless him,
is not a medical doctor.

14:29.994 --> 14:30.995
Nor am I.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.580
And most definitely
neither are you.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.290
The division
between the two sides

14:34.290 --> 14:36.292
of Rafael’s mind exists
for a reason,

14:36.292 --> 14:38.294
to protect his sanity and to...
Emma, please.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.546
Obviously, something
terrible happened.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.757
Landon and MG are out
there somewhere.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.258
Do you think
I’m not concerned about them?

14:44.258 --> 14:45.426
Of course I am.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.053
Then we need to do something.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.513
Hope, I said no.

14:48.513 --> 14:49.847
And I’m not gonna let you...

14:49.847 --> 14:52.517
(gasps)

14:52.517 --> 14:53.935
I’m sorry, Emma.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.188
But Hope’s right.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.899
Do what you got to do.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.867
Here.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.078
Just drink it.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.288
(exhales)

15:15.373 --> 15:17.250
(groans)
Here.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.876
(sniffs)

15:18.876 --> 15:19.877
Okay.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.337
(exhales)

15:22.839 --> 15:24.924
(both exhale)

15:24.924 --> 15:26.509
You said you saw a monster.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.386
I did?

15:28.386 --> 15:29.971
Yeah.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.722
I don’t-I don’t...
I don’t remember that.

15:31.722 --> 15:32.723
Okay.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.016
Tell me what you do remember.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.355
RAFAEL:
I know you think
you’re helping, but you’re not.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.899
I mean,
just look at him.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.153
Just take it from somebody

15:45.153 --> 15:46.445
that’s been kept in the dark
his whole life.

15:46.445 --> 15:47.697
At least he knows the truth.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.241
And sometimes the truth hurts.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.118
You know that better
than anybody.

15:52.118 --> 15:52.952
Hey.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.245
His dad is religious.

15:54.245 --> 15:57.248
If Hector and Maria
taught us anything,

15:57.248 --> 15:58.332
it’s what?

15:58.332 --> 15:59.792
Religious people
aren’t too flexible

15:59.792 --> 16:01.210
about their beliefs.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.170
Hey.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.462
Raf’s right.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.798
My dad’s not gonna want
a vampire in the family.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.258
It is what it is.

16:07.258 --> 16:08.467
It is what it...

16:09.385 --> 16:11.012
Or maybe it’s worse.

16:11.012 --> 16:11.762
Look,

16:11.762 --> 16:12.972
I took that

16:12.972 --> 16:14.724
from your
parents’ mailbox.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.434
Your dad became
a prominent figure

16:16.434 --> 16:18.227
after he gave a sermon
that went viral,

16:18.227 --> 16:22.398
a sermon about how he would give
anything to have you back.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.774
It is one thing to cut
you out of his life.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.444
It is another thing
to use your memory to get votes.

16:26.444 --> 16:27.320
(grunts)

16:27.320 --> 16:29.322
We can come back
another time.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.324
It’s only a couple hours
until moonrise...

16:31.324 --> 16:32.658
We can do both.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.410
Your dad is giving
another speech tonight.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.078
And-and it’s on the way home.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.080
Lan, please,
stop pushing.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.457
Landon,
I don’t know

16:39.457 --> 16:41.042
if I...
Listen to me,

16:41.042 --> 16:44.754
I would give anything to ask my
mom and dad why they gave me up.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.214
You actually have a chance to.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.303
MR. GREASLEY:
When my son used to get
in trouble,

16:52.303 --> 16:54.513
he’d always say,

16:54.513 --> 16:56.474
"But, Dad,

16:56.474 --> 17:00.853
you’re forgetting about all
the good things I did today."

17:00.853 --> 17:03.356
After I lost him,

17:03.356 --> 17:06.275
everything in the
world seemed bad.

17:06.275 --> 17:10.196
But I’m not going
to let despair win.

17:10.196 --> 17:13.491
I am running for mayor
because my son

17:13.491 --> 17:15.326
taught me a valuable lesson.

17:15.326 --> 17:18.204
Because I don’t
want us to forget

17:18.204 --> 17:20.206
all the good

17:20.206 --> 17:22.250
we still can do.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.336
What are you waiting for?

17:25.336 --> 17:27.755
For starters,
I can’t feel my legs,

17:27.755 --> 17:29.465
so...

17:29.465 --> 17:30.591
Someone there?

17:33.719 --> 17:36.138
If you’re so concerned
with... doing good,

17:36.138 --> 17:38.641
you might want to take the time
to see your own son.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.108
Milton?

17:48.484 --> 17:49.360
Is that you?

17:49.360 --> 17:50.486
Yeah.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.321
Obviously.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.994
Good Lord,

17:57.994 --> 18:00.329
my eyes
must be playing tricks on me.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.747
It’s me.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.333
Same son you’re preaching about.

18:04.333 --> 18:08.254
Who’s apparently gonna win
all these elections for you.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.424
Who you haven’t called in...

18:11.424 --> 18:13.301
almost a year.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.096
Lord, if this is a test,

18:17.096 --> 18:18.514
clear my eyes

18:18.514 --> 18:21.517
and let me see the truth.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.435
Pops.

18:23.686 --> 18:26.022
Don’t you love me anymore?

18:26.022 --> 18:27.857
My boy.

18:31.694 --> 18:34.155
My beautiful boy.

18:35.323 --> 18:37.074
I prayed

18:37.074 --> 18:38.617
and prayed.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.036
And the good Lord

18:40.036 --> 18:42.413
brought you back to me.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.415
Prayer’s cool and all,

18:44.415 --> 18:47.376
but you could’ve just picked up
the phone.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.545
(sniffles)

18:51.589 --> 18:53.174
I saw you

18:53.174 --> 18:55.551
on that terrible night.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.429
With my own two
eyes, I saw you.

18:58.429 --> 19:00.473
Now you’re here,

19:00.473 --> 19:02.183
risen.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.477
A miracle

19:04.477 --> 19:07.396
sent to me from
our Lord in heaven.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.447
HOPE:
Wait, wait, wait.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.324
So...

19:18.324 --> 19:20.993
you’re saying that MG’s dad
didn’t know he was a vampire?

19:20.993 --> 19:23.996
I’m saying that MG’s dad thought
that he was dead.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.505
RAFAEL:
We didn’t want
to leave MG behind,

19:32.505 --> 19:34.632
but it was getting late.

19:34.632 --> 19:37.635
And we knew that I had to get
back before I turned, and...

19:37.635 --> 19:38.761
(shuddering exhale)

19:38.761 --> 19:40.221
What?

19:40.221 --> 19:42.765
We didn’t make it back on time,
Hope.

19:47.478 --> 19:48.437
(grunts)

19:51.107 --> 19:52.400
All good.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.609
You sure this is gonna work?

19:53.609 --> 19:55.236
Oh, to be honest, bro,

19:55.236 --> 19:56.445
this is actually a first for me.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.406
But if you have a better idea,

19:58.406 --> 19:59.990
I’m all ears.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.243
A better plan would’ve been
not leaving the school at all.

20:02.243 --> 20:05.663
Well, excuse me
for wanting to help MG.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.915
(grunts)
Or you.

20:07.915 --> 20:10.418
And now we’re
both screwed.

20:10.418 --> 20:13.712
’Cause, what, you-you couldn’t
find your parents, so you...

20:13.712 --> 20:15.172
you made him get
answers from his?

20:15.172 --> 20:16.173
That’s not right.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.967
Answers
that made his life better.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.261
And this is coming
from the guy who won’t
even have the conversation?

20:20.261 --> 20:21.887
What conversation?

20:21.887 --> 20:23.681
The conversation

20:23.681 --> 20:25.683
you have been avoiding

20:25.683 --> 20:27.143
all week.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.894
And, hey, look at that.
I have the key to the padlocks.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.521
So... we’re having it.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.648
I don’t know what
you’re talking about.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.650
(sighs)
Raf.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.068
Come on, man.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.570
What?
Look...

20:37.570 --> 20:38.737
(panting)

20:38.737 --> 20:41.282
We both know

20:41.282 --> 20:42.533
you have feelings for Hope.

20:42.533 --> 20:43.534
(sighs)

20:43.534 --> 20:45.578
That was the slug talking.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.164
The slug lowered
your inhibitions.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.790
But it didn’t
make you do

20:49.790 --> 20:52.293
anything
you didn’t already want to do.

20:52.293 --> 20:55.421
Whether or not I have feelings,

20:55.421 --> 20:56.422
it don’t matter,

20:56.422 --> 20:58.257
’cause I would never

20:58.257 --> 21:00.050
act on them.
I would never.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.429
I know.
Of course I know that.

21:03.429 --> 21:06.432
Bro, then why did you
just make me say that?

21:06.432 --> 21:08.767
Because, Raf...

21:08.767 --> 21:12.938
I have seen what happens
when you bottle stuff up inside.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.274
Sooner or later,
that bottle’s gonna shatter.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.443
And I hate seeing you in pain.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.986
(grunts)
Whoa!

21:18.986 --> 21:21.363
(groans)
What do I do? What do I do?

21:21.363 --> 21:22.615
You got to get out of here.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.784
Grab MG

21:25.784 --> 21:27.786
and steer clear of the woods
until morning.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.455
No. There’s no way.
I’m gonna stay right here.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.372
We’re gonna
get through this together,

21:30.372 --> 21:31.749
like we always have.

21:31.749 --> 21:32.958
(growling)

21:32.958 --> 21:34.502
What the hell was that?

21:34.502 --> 21:36.295
(scream in distance)

21:36.295 --> 21:38.214
I don’t know.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.381
(growling continues)

21:42.384 --> 21:44.345
Oh. (exhales)

21:46.347 --> 21:48.599
Lan. Lan, look at me.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.559
You need to run.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.311
Not without you.

21:55.064 --> 21:58.150
(grunts) I said...

21:58.150 --> 21:59.401
Run!

21:59.401 --> 22:00.361
Raf. Raf.
(panting)

22:00.361 --> 22:02.154
Hey. Hey. Here.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.489
Here. Here, here,
here, here. Drink this.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.365
Drink this. Drink this.

22:04.365 --> 22:06.408
(groans)

22:06.408 --> 22:07.785
Okay.
(panting)

22:07.785 --> 22:09.745
Hey. What did you see?

22:09.745 --> 22:11.372
What did you see? What
were you running from?
I don’t know. I don’t know!

22:11.372 --> 22:13.832
Raf, whatever you saw
is what made you like this.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.417
Did the monster hurt Landon?

22:15.417 --> 22:16.627
(whispering):
I don’t know.

22:16.627 --> 22:19.004
Is Landon okay, Raf?!
I don’t know, Hope.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.005
I don’t know. I don’t know.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.428
Okay. Do you remember
where the woods were?

22:28.430 --> 22:30.307
I think so.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.354
Yeah, I remember.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.231
Okay. Okay.

22:37.231 --> 22:38.732
I’m gonna get one of the twins
to siphon you out of here.

22:38.732 --> 22:39.775
We’re gonna go find him.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.530
This is the place
Hope talked about.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.907
She happen to mention
that arrangement

22:46.907 --> 22:49.076
you made with Mrs. Greasley,
too, when she called?

22:52.037 --> 22:55.791
MG’s mother enrolled him
in the Salvatore School

22:55.791 --> 22:58.586
without his father knowing
that he was still alive.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.337
She didn’t think
his dad could handle

23:00.337 --> 23:02.172
the fact that MG
was a vampire.

23:02.172 --> 23:06.135
Our arrangement was
to keep that a secret.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.262
(chuckles softly)

23:08.262 --> 23:10.180
Shady.

23:10.180 --> 23:13.767
Shadiest part
being you saying yes.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.185
I didn’t want to.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.895
But I didn’t want to
turn MG away, either.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.606
I mean, admittedly, it’s
a bit of a gray area.

23:18.606 --> 23:21.191
No, it’s not.
Life is black and white.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.112
You’re a teenager, Kaleb.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.072
A smart one.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.616
Too smart, sometimes.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.784
But when you have been through
what I’ve been through

23:30.784 --> 23:33.037
and seen what I have seen,

23:33.037 --> 23:34.955
you’ll learn that life

23:34.955 --> 23:37.082
is rarely that simple.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.880
Do you smell that?

23:46.342 --> 23:48.177
Okay, what is it?

23:49.345 --> 23:50.721
Blood.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.732
MG?

24:01.732 --> 24:03.442
MG.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.694
MG!

24:05.694 --> 24:07.363
MG. MG.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.865
Oh. Oh.
(whimpering)

24:09.865 --> 24:12.701
Damn it. Damn it.
Oh, my God.
It’s okay. It’s okay.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.328
All right, take it easy.

24:14.328 --> 24:16.580
Stay away from me, Dr. Saltzman.

24:16.580 --> 24:17.581
I can’t control it.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.208
Shh. It’s okay. We’re here.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.709
We’re here.
Just tell me what happened.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.128
There are demons all around me.
What?

24:23.128 --> 24:25.172
Beast horns and devils’ tongues.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.508
What the hell is
wrong with him?
He’s delusional,

24:27.508 --> 24:29.343
which means only one thing.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.178
(groans)

24:31.178 --> 24:32.888
He’s been bitten.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.182
He’s a vampire.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.433
We do the biting.
By a werewolf.

24:36.433 --> 24:39.019
What?

24:39.019 --> 24:40.979
Rafael.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.190
He said he saw a monster.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.109
He is the damn monster.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.154
Oh, my God.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.614
The infection’s
spreading to his heart.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.242
If he was bitten last night,
he’s got maybe an hour.

24:53.242 --> 24:54.410
Two, tops.

24:54.410 --> 24:55.953
What?

24:55.953 --> 24:57.955
The cure.

24:57.955 --> 24:59.415
G-Give him the damn cure
you were talking about.

24:59.415 --> 25:01.542
Hope’s blood is the cure.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.502
The blood of the tribrid.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.921
Let’s just hope
she can get here soon.

25:08.966 --> 25:10.718
Just stay with us, MG.
All right?

25:10.718 --> 25:12.428
We got you. We got you.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.518
Why aren’t they
picking up the phone?

25:19.518 --> 25:21.395
I don’t know. They must’ve
left the building, okay?

25:21.395 --> 25:22.980
And I have the school
phone with me.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.523
Okay, well,
now would be the perfect time

25:24.523 --> 25:26.233
to add cellular privileges
to the many things

25:26.233 --> 25:27.818
that need to change
at the school.

25:27.818 --> 25:30.487
Don’t say that.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.239
Pop, why do you...
why do you got to say that?

25:32.239 --> 25:34.700
Hey, hey. MG, stay with me.
Stay with me, okay?

25:34.700 --> 25:36.076
Stay with me, man.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.578
(whispers):
I just want to go to sleep.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.663
No, no, no, no.
That’s-that’s not an option.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.081
Okay?

25:41.081 --> 25:43.208
So, talk-talk to me more
about your pops.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.418
Just-just talk to me.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.462
He was really happy to see me.

25:46.462 --> 25:48.547
He didn’t know I was there.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.967
And I didn’t know how
to tell him.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.469
MR. GREASLEY:
Your mother.

25:53.469 --> 25:56.096
We got to go back home
and tell your mother.

25:56.096 --> 25:58.557
Uh, sh-she knows.
I told her.

25:59.933 --> 26:01.435
She...

26:01.435 --> 26:04.062
wanted me to spend
some time alone

26:04.062 --> 26:05.272
with you.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.983
Oh. Well, then,

26:07.983 --> 26:10.694
let’s go across the street
to Tippy’s diner

26:10.694 --> 26:12.696
and talk it over.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.323
Almond crumble,

26:14.323 --> 26:17.075
two scoops of vanilla.

26:17.075 --> 26:20.454
Like we used to every Sunday
after mass, huh?
(chuckles): Yeah, yeah.

26:20.454 --> 26:24.082
Yeah, um, I am
kind of starving,

26:24.082 --> 26:27.127
but somebody might see me.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.004
I want the whole world
to see you.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.340
Shout it out to the rooftops.

26:31.340 --> 26:35.219
My boy is back
by the grace of God.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.806
Yeah, but...

26:38.806 --> 26:41.266
your campaign.

26:43.227 --> 26:44.978
No one will believe
that it’s real.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.522
They’ll think you
lied for votes.

26:46.522 --> 26:50.567
Well, if I lose an election
over that, so be it.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.987
The truth is the truth.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.535
About that...

26:59.535 --> 27:02.371
I-I have something
to show you.

27:02.371 --> 27:04.915
And I don’t think
you’re gonna like it,

27:04.915 --> 27:06.917
but you taught me

27:06.917 --> 27:09.169
to-to live by my truth,

27:09.169 --> 27:10.879
and-and I want to honor that.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.147
(whispers):
Okay. You got this.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.899
Son, what’s happening?

27:30.899 --> 27:32.734
Don’t hate me for this, Pop.

27:32.734 --> 27:35.279
I’m not human anymore.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.741
(gasps)

27:39.741 --> 27:41.827
(grunting)

27:44.371 --> 27:46.373
I-I’m sorry.

27:46.373 --> 27:47.416
Dear God.

27:47.416 --> 27:48.792
Look, it’s okay. It’s okay.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.752
I’m-I’m working on
controlling it.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.129
There’s this school
that I go to, and-and...

27:52.129 --> 27:55.424
In the name of almighty Jesus,

27:55.424 --> 27:58.635
get out of here! Begone!

27:58.635 --> 28:00.596
Pops, it’s-it’s me.
It’s Milton.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.055
You’re a demon.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.015
Stop!

28:05.851 --> 28:07.185
I’m a vampire.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.021
And I know you don’t
understand that,

28:09.021 --> 28:10.689
and I barely
understand it myself,

28:10.689 --> 28:13.567
but that doesn’t
mean that I’m evil.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.569
I-I just have to try
harder to be good.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.782
And I’d-I’d tell you
to speak your truth,

28:20.782 --> 28:22.576
but I kind of have
superpowers, so...

28:22.576 --> 28:25.621
you don’t really have a choice.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.836
And I want to know...

28:32.836 --> 28:34.630
Tell me...

28:36.548 --> 28:38.342
...how do you feel
about me right now?

28:38.342 --> 28:40.552
Me, your son?

28:42.679 --> 28:44.473
My son is dead.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.144
He didn’t want me anymore.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.355
(grunts)

28:54.191 --> 28:57.194
Listen, it takes time.

28:57.194 --> 28:59.947
It takes time for some
parents to understand.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.823
I’ll go back there.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.742
I’ll compel
his intolerant ass.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.703
Don’t bother.

29:06.703 --> 29:09.247
I took care of it.

29:21.343 --> 29:24.638
I’m still your boy, Pop.

29:24.638 --> 29:25.931
Th-The boy

29:25.931 --> 29:27.683
who-who sat here

29:27.683 --> 29:31.395
and watched you
practice your sermons.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.358
The boy who still has
a lot of good to do.

29:39.361 --> 29:43.240
But Mom was right.

29:43.240 --> 29:46.201
You’re better off
thinking that I’m dead.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.796
So you didn’t see me here today.

29:58.922 --> 30:02.300
But always believe that...

30:02.300 --> 30:04.428
you’re gonna see the...

30:04.428 --> 30:07.389
the boy that you love...

30:07.389 --> 30:08.640
again.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.279
(sighs)

30:23.321 --> 30:25.240
Know what?

30:25.240 --> 30:26.408
You’re better off, man.

30:27.492 --> 30:30.203
He was right to be afraid of me,

30:30.203 --> 30:32.789
’cause I can’t control it.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.124
Yes, you can. You
can control it, okay?

30:34.124 --> 30:35.584
You’ve been working
real hard at it, and when

30:35.584 --> 30:36.877
we get back to school, you’re
gonna keep working hard.

30:36.877 --> 30:38.962
I can’t go back to that school,
Dr. Saltzman.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.797
Not after what I did.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.299
Hey, hey,
you didn’t do anything.

30:42.299 --> 30:44.176
It’s your
sorry-ass parents, okay?

30:44.176 --> 30:45.802
They’re the bad guys, not you.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.472
You’re wrong.
I’m a killer.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.223
What’s he talking about?
HOPE: Hey.

30:50.223 --> 30:51.725
Dr. Saltzman?

30:51.725 --> 30:53.435
Oh, Hope, thank
God you made it.

30:53.435 --> 30:54.436
What-What’s going on?

30:54.436 --> 30:55.854
MG has a werewolf bite.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.064
He doesn’t have much time.

30:57.064 --> 30:59.941
(MG whimpering)
Oh, my God.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.193
KALEB:
All right, now. Okay...

31:01.193 --> 31:02.819
I bit you.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.488
What?

31:05.822 --> 31:07.699
This is all my fault.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.326
Raf, I’m so sorry.

31:09.326 --> 31:11.995
What, sorry?
What are you sorry for?

31:11.995 --> 31:14.122
He’s the one that should
be sorry. He’s the fool

31:14.122 --> 31:15.999
that bit you.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, stop.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.292
Don’t move.
Hey!

31:17.292 --> 31:18.627
Hey. Hey, what’s going on?

31:18.627 --> 31:20.796
What’s wrong? What’s
going on? What?

31:20.796 --> 31:22.881
Hey.
I remember now.

31:25.550 --> 31:28.845
The elixir. His face.

31:28.845 --> 31:32.224
Being back here...

31:32.224 --> 31:34.142
(breathing deeply)

31:37.896 --> 31:40.107
I remember who the monster was.

31:40.107 --> 31:42.025
I said run.

31:42.025 --> 31:45.070
I told you
I am not leaving you alone.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.865
(screeching in distance)

31:56.081 --> 31:59.251
Damn it, MG.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.294
You s-scared
the crap out of me.

32:01.294 --> 32:03.922
MG, you can’t be here.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.298
I’m about to turn.

32:05.298 --> 32:07.008
It’s not safe.

32:07.008 --> 32:07.884
For him.

32:09.136 --> 32:10.679
’Cause I’m about
to kick his ass.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.264
What? Why?

32:14.641 --> 32:16.643
This was all your fault.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.770
You made me come here.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.522
You rang that doorbell.

32:20.522 --> 32:21.898
You showed me
that paper.

32:21.898 --> 32:24.860
And you put all your crap on me.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.903
Lan. Lan, get me out
of these chains.

32:26.903 --> 32:29.030
MG, I’m sorry. What happ...

32:29.030 --> 32:31.074
(grunts)
Oh! Lan!

32:31.074 --> 32:32.409
Okay, I deserve that.

32:32.409 --> 32:33.952
Now calm down!

32:41.209 --> 32:44.171
RAFAEL:
Hey, look at me.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.213
MG.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.592
No.

32:48.592 --> 32:49.885
MG,

32:49.885 --> 32:51.553
you can fight this.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.889
You have to fight this.
Please.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.977
You don’t understand.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.813
(groaning)

33:01.813 --> 33:04.733
I don’t have anything left
to fight for.

33:06.067 --> 33:07.569
My dad was right.

33:07.569 --> 33:10.363
I’m a monster.
(quietly)
You’re not.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.866
(screaming)

33:12.866 --> 33:14.951
(growling)

33:14.951 --> 33:18.955
MG, no!

33:18.955 --> 33:21.917
(Rafael yelling, distorted)

33:23.126 --> 33:25.003
(gasps)

33:29.591 --> 33:30.842
(distorted screaming)

33:32.928 --> 33:34.930
MG!
(crying)

33:48.276 --> 33:50.403
MG:
I did it. It was me.

33:50.403 --> 33:52.239
I’m the monster.

33:53.907 --> 33:57.285
When you finished your turn,
y-you got loose and bit MG.

33:57.285 --> 34:00.538
Watching Landon die was
too traumatic, too human,

34:00.538 --> 34:03.208
so you reverted back
and scrambled your memory.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.835
I don’t want to remember
any of this.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.963
Raf, where are you going?

34:07.963 --> 34:09.798
Away from MG before
I finish the job.

34:09.798 --> 34:11.091
Hey.

34:13.218 --> 34:15.220
Landon’s body
is out there.

34:16.930 --> 34:19.557
I’m gonna go find it.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.729
MG:
I was so mad.

34:24.729 --> 34:27.315
I wanted to h-hurt Landon.

34:30.485 --> 34:33.238
I didn’t want his blood.

34:33.238 --> 34:35.031
I needed it.

34:35.031 --> 34:36.741
I needed all of it.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.827
’Cause I’m not a monster.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.537
I’m a demon.

34:40.537 --> 34:42.956
So many demons in hell.

34:42.956 --> 34:45.208
Okay, okay,
all right, all right.
Shh.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.502
Dr. S.?

34:50.130 --> 34:52.882
Just... just give
her a minute.

34:52.882 --> 34:54.467
But what if she won’t...

34:54.467 --> 34:57.345
She will. She will.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.398
I need your knife.
