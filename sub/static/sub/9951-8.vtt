WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:03.537
- Previously on Haven...

00:03.670 --> 00:05.331
- You really think this
Jess Minion is a witch?

00:05.464 --> 00:06.795
- What do you think
the troubles are?

00:06.924 --> 00:08.380
Magic is everywhere here.

00:08.509 --> 00:12.297
- Whatever she is,
she is interesting.

00:14.890 --> 00:17.381
- So you seriously
can't feel pain?

00:17.518 --> 00:19.224
- It's called
idiopathic neuropathy.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.810
- Jess, I think Detective
Wuornos needs to come by

00:21.939 --> 00:23.429
and conduct a safety review
of your home.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.226
I'd say around 8:00?
- Great.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.690
Maybe you can bring
a nice bottle.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.194
- Of wine?

00:28.320 --> 00:31.232
- Does she know you're not a...
a real boy?

00:31.365 --> 00:34.027
- I'm gonna do what I can
to help you find out

00:34.159 --> 00:35.399
about your mum.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.651
- You would do that?

00:36.787 --> 00:38.743
- Well, we gotta stick together
up here.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.863
- The troubles are back,
aren't they?

00:40.999 --> 00:43.376
- Yeah, I think so.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.834
- And I'm afraid they won't
go away this time.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.130
[loud smack]

01:35.429 --> 01:39.297
[punching sounds]

01:49.026 --> 01:51.608
[groans]

02:36.073 --> 02:39.861
- Nonfat almond mocha latte

02:39.993 --> 02:42.735
with a dusting of cinnamon,
I think.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.736
- Black, I think.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.285
- Nope, I decided
to try yours.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.702
- How do you like it?

02:48.835 --> 02:53.124
- Still working up
the nerve to try it.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.121
- You know you could have
come inside.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.509
- You were sleeping.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.500
- You could have been
sleeping too.

02:58.637 --> 03:01.720
- But then who would have
got us the coffees?

03:01.848 --> 03:04.100
- [chuckles]
- Right?

03:04.226 --> 03:06.717
- Oh, you're an odd man,
Detective Wuornos.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.265
- That's what
they keep telling me.

03:12.984 --> 03:16.693
- I have a few people
to visit today.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.029
Would you like
to come by tonight?

03:20.575 --> 03:22.702
- Yeah.

03:22.828 --> 03:23.943
I'd like that.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.239
[cell phone rings]

03:25.372 --> 03:27.237
- Tell Audrey I say hello.

03:27.374 --> 03:30.366
[ringing continues]

03:35.340 --> 03:36.546
- Hi.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.711
[police radio chatter]

03:43.724 --> 03:46.010
- Hey, thanks for
picking me up this morning.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.885
My car just wasn't feeling
up for it or something.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.679
Thanks.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.521
Mmm.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.981
What is this?

03:55.110 --> 03:56.771
- Dessert, I think.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.111
- Ah, Jess's influence,
I take it.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.946
- She has a sweet tooth.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.781
- All right, so you went out
with her last night,

04:03.910 --> 04:05.616
but you're bringing her
coffee in the morning?

04:05.746 --> 04:07.407
That means that you
didn't spend the night,

04:07.539 --> 04:09.279
and no sane man
leaves that woman's bed

04:09.416 --> 04:11.122
unless the world
is on fire.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.458
- If I hadn't picked you up,
who would you have called?

04:13.587 --> 04:16.124
- I don't know,
a bureau car, a cab.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.712
- Any friends you can call?

04:17.841 --> 04:19.126
- [chuckles]
Here?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.669
I've been here, what,
five minutes.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.338
- It's been a lot longer
than that.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.802
- Okay, you know what,

04:23.930 --> 04:25.215
if you don't want
to talk about Jess,

04:25.348 --> 04:26.508
just say so.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.381
- Would that work?

04:28.518 --> 04:31.225
- Probably not.
- Probably not.

04:31.354 --> 04:34.938
Who would you have called
in Boston?

04:35.066 --> 04:37.648
- A bureau car, a cab.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.564
l have friends!

04:39.696 --> 04:40.811
- Mm-hmm.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.778
What's that cop's name?

04:42.908 --> 04:44.990
- Steve.
- Stan.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.403
How 'bout her?

04:46.536 --> 04:47.912
- Okay, I get it.
You know, I get it.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.153
Good morning, Stu.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.201
- Morning, Audrey.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.824
- Morning, Stan.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.075
- Hey, Nathan.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.452
-Cmp

04:56.588 --> 04:57.873
All right, so who's
our friend here?

04:58.006 --> 04:59.121
- Bill Rand.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.713
Stabbed through the heart

05:00.842 --> 05:02.298
after he came out
of that bar at closing time.

05:02.427 --> 05:03.542
- Weapon?

05:03.678 --> 05:04.838
- Honestly not sure.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.256
A long knife, sword, spear.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.970
Whatever it was,
it went right through him.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.841
And whoever used it
took it with 'em.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.353
- Looks like Mr. Rand
was stabbed

05:12.479 --> 05:14.015
through his I.D. first
and then his heart.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.648
- Not easy to do.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.514
- Well, not unless you're
trying to make a point.

05:20.779 --> 05:21.894
Doesn't Jess work there?

05:22.030 --> 05:24.646
- Yeah, Jess works there
sometimes.

05:24.783 --> 05:27.149
So what do you think,
angry patient?

05:27.285 --> 05:28.616
coworker?

05:28.745 --> 05:31.612
- Yeah, it makes sense.
Let's start there.

05:31.748 --> 05:32.863
Thanks, Steve.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.864
-Uh...

05:35.001 --> 05:36.912
you're welcome.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.206
- Hmm.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.206
[dramatic music]

05:42.342 --> 05:50.340
J‘J‘

06:16.918 --> 06:19.079
- l have friends.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.543
- I shouldn't
have said anything.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.162
It's just this
whole thing with Jess,

06:22.299 --> 06:25.211
it's making me do things
I wouldn't normally do.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.459
- But, you know,
she's worth it.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.757
- Yeah.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.006
Yeah, she is.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.387
So...

06:35.520 --> 06:37.135
do you have friends?

06:37.272 --> 06:40.480
- l--l mean, I guess ljust,
I never had time for them.

06:40.609 --> 06:43.567
I worked two jobs in college,

06:43.695 --> 06:46.277
and then went to Quantico,
and then the bureau.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.646
- You should try
small talk.

06:47.782 --> 06:50.364
- Nathan Wuornos
promoting small talk?

06:50.493 --> 06:52.358
That's like Superman trying
to sell kryptonite.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.952
- I'm not the one
looking for friends.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.072
- Hey, I didn't say
that l was looking for friends.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.823
- Right this way, please.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.336
- Watch this.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.794
I like your hair.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.000
- All right,
I need practice.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.546
- Tons.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.340
- Can you think of anybody
that may have wanted

07:11.473 --> 07:12.588
to harm Mr. Rand?

07:12.724 --> 07:14.214
- No, I really don't.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.512
Bill was a nurse here
forever.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.808
The patients really liked him,
and so did the doctors.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.896
- Were there any incidents
here at the medical center

07:22.025 --> 07:23.140
that were related
to Mr. Rand?

07:23.276 --> 07:24.607
- Not that I can think of.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.897
- When we talk to his
coworkers and patients,

07:27.030 --> 07:28.520
we're not gonna hear
about anything?

07:30.909 --> 07:32.991
- The dark man.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.450
- Excuse me?

07:34.579 --> 07:36.035
- We deal with a lot
of sad stories here--

07:36.164 --> 07:37.665
people fighting
for their lives,

07:37.791 --> 07:38.997
taking terrible drugs,

07:39.125 --> 07:40.661
often just to have
a few more months.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.035
There's no explanation
as to why one person dies

07:43.171 --> 07:44.331
and another one lives.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.171
Some families make up stories

07:47.300 --> 07:48.631
to make some sort of sense
of it all.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.671
- Families believe
a dark man

07:50.804 --> 07:54.262
is responsible
for patient deaths?

07:54.391 --> 07:56.882
- It's not unusual at all.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.474
- Well, until we can meet
the dark man,

07:58.603 --> 08:00.764
I'd like to focus
on someone we can see.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.762
- And so he took
this terrible situation

08:02.899 --> 08:05.356
and, like he always did,
he made it a funny story.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.271
[laughter]

08:07.404 --> 08:09.611
I think maybe that's what
I miss most about Rubin.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.695
- Hey, we should go in.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.237
- No, I can see Jess
some other time.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.984
- No, actually I thought
it would be good

08:16.121 --> 08:17.782
to go in and see
if these people can tell us

08:17.914 --> 08:19.120
more about the place.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.989
- Oh, of course.
Yeah, absolutely.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.538
- That and his laugh
and his singing.

08:23.670 --> 08:28.255
And his--well,
I guess you get the idea.

08:28.383 --> 08:29.748
Thanks for listening.

08:29.884 --> 08:33.877
[applause]

08:34.014 --> 08:37.256
- Thornton, is there anything
you'd like to share

08:37.392 --> 08:40.475
about Sarabeth?

08:40.603 --> 08:41.809
-Um...

08:41.938 --> 08:43.803
I know that we're supposed

08:43.940 --> 08:45.441
to be remembering
our loved ones today,

08:45.567 --> 08:48.479
but I have to--
to remember something else.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.102
I was a miserable
and angry husband,

08:51.239 --> 08:54.447
and I treated my Sarabeth
like garbage.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.532
Now I'm not
that person anymore.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.401
And when she died,
that person went with her.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.996
I just wish that...

09:02.125 --> 09:03.535
just wish
she could have been married

09:03.668 --> 09:06.205
to the man I am now.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.967
- That was really
powerful stuff.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.882
- All those people
lost someone recently.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.763
Hello.
- Hi.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.057
- Jess, did you know
Bill Rand?

09:25.190 --> 09:27.602
- Nurse Rand?
Why?

09:27.734 --> 09:29.816
- He was killed
this morning.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.196
- Oh, my God.

09:32.322 --> 09:33.528
- Are you Jess's policeman?

09:33.656 --> 09:37.023
- Uh, guess I am.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.775
- We want you to know
that the dark man is real.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.448
- What exactly
is the dark man?

09:40.580 --> 09:41.695
- We don't know.

09:41.831 --> 09:42.991
We just know he's a killer

09:43.124 --> 09:44.455
and that he took
our families from us.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.915
- Maybe we should let
the officers go.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.454
- No, no, it's okay.

09:47.587 --> 09:51.250
Have any of you seen
the dark man kill anyone?

09:51.382 --> 09:53.418
- No, but we've seen him
lurking around here.

09:53.551 --> 09:54.927
We've all had family members

09:55.053 --> 09:57.385
die before their time
because of him.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.004
- We realize
how crazy it sounds.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.755
- Well, it would sound better
with evidence.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.883
- Here, why don't we take
your contact information,

10:03.019 --> 10:05.681
and if anything turns up,
we'll let you know.

10:05.814 --> 10:08.055
- Okay.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.726
- Unsurprisingly,

10:12.862 --> 10:14.602
there's nothing
about dark man in here.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.855
- No one seems
connected to Rand.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.777
- Or filed a complaint
against him.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.616
- Hey, thank you, Allan.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.906
- Hey, Audrey.
- Allan.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.121
He'd give me a ride
if I wanted him to.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.117
- That's nice.
Except his name is Bob.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.993
- Anyway, I would say
that we have nothing,

10:30.130 --> 10:32.542
but I think we have
less than nothing.

10:32.674 --> 10:33.789
- Actually,
you have dinner.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.506
- Awesome.

10:35.635 --> 10:40.174
Nathan, would you please
marry this woman?

10:40.306 --> 10:41.716
Sorry.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.511
Did ljust
make that awkward?

10:43.643 --> 10:45.725
- Well, we have to get
to second base first.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.015
Sorry, I made that
even more awkward.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.604
- [laughs]

10:49.732 --> 10:52.860
- Moo shu, kung pao,
Peking duck, the classics.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.149
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.612
Apparently it's what
I have to do

10:57.740 --> 10:59.241
if I want to see you
at night.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.653
- In that case, I will
keep him late every night.

11:01.786 --> 11:02.901
- Whoa.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.028
- Oops.
- That's all right.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.076
- Well,
hoW's it going today?

11:07.208 --> 11:10.700
- Um, murder,

11:10.837 --> 11:12.452
secrets, the usual.

11:12.589 --> 11:13.749
- Sounds sad.

11:13.882 --> 11:15.338
- Actually,
the saddest thing

11:15.466 --> 11:17.673
was those families today
at the Hessberg Center.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.508
Seemed like most of them
weren't able to accept

11:19.637 --> 11:21.047
the death of their
family members yet.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.762
- I've been trying
to talk them out of

11:22.891 --> 11:24.847
the dark man idea for weeks.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.092
- We don't exactly know
what's going on at the center,

11:27.228 --> 11:30.061
so maybe you should just take
a few days off until we do.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.226
- Isn't he cute when he wants
to take charge?

11:32.358 --> 11:33.518
- He is cute.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.107
You should see him
around babies.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.567
- [laughing]
Okay.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.985
Well, time to let you
get back to work.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.903
Maybe I'll see you later?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.321
- I will try.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.694
- Bye.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.378
- You sure you're up
for planning a trip?

11:55.506 --> 11:57.042
- No, but I need to think

11:57.175 --> 11:59.131
about something other
than Bill for a while.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.091
- You know, these tours
are pretty expensive.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.428
- We have the money.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.888
Where to begin.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.178
- I'm going
to order dinner.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.265
- Maybe France.

12:15.401 --> 12:19.064
Omelette du fromage,
s'il vous plait.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.483
Oh, café au Iait.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.607
Merci.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.450
Bien stir.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.787
Ooh la la.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.077
Mais, oui.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.747
[tense music]

12:43.096 --> 12:45.508
[gasping]

12:55.275 --> 12:57.391
- Found the hole.

12:57.527 --> 13:00.234
- So the knife went through her
and punctured the couch?

13:00.363 --> 13:02.024
- No, the ME. said that
she was stabbed from behind,

13:02.156 --> 13:03.737
so it had to go
through the couch first.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.243
- A knife that long
would never fit back there.

13:06.369 --> 13:08.280
- No, it wouldn't,
but it did.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.823
At this point,
the dark man's

13:09.956 --> 13:11.412
starting to make
a lot more sense to me.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.372
- Stabbing's emotional.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.037
Somebody was really
pissed off.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.625
- Hey, can you make sure
to get a picture

13:16.754 --> 13:17.869
of the back of the couch?

13:18.006 --> 13:19.246
- Sure.
- Thanks, Tony.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.843
Steve?
- Eddie.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.711
- Ed--damn.
That wasn't even an option.

13:25.847 --> 13:28.259
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie,
Eddie, great.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.927
Thanks for coming in,
Mrs. Halter.

13:34.063 --> 13:37.772
- Menchie.
- Menchie.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.891
Can you tell us
about the dark man?

13:40.028 --> 13:41.859
- Finally.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.524
Of course I can.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.612
He's tall and thin.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.824
- He's short and wide.
- 6'5".

13:47.952 --> 13:49.067
- Are you sure?

13:49.203 --> 13:50.818
- Absolutely, positive.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.070
And dark.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.332
Really dark.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.073
- I heard he carried a sword.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.335
That's what I heard.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.042
- But obviously you've--

13:58.171 --> 13:59.286
you've never seen him.

13:59.422 --> 14:00.753
- I'm a good listener.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.588
- No, no, not a sword.

14:02.717 --> 14:05.003
Maybe--maybe more like a bat.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.297
- Definitely dark, though.
- Everyone says dark.

14:07.430 --> 14:08.795
- Yes, dark.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.546
- Look, our family members
died too soon.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.264
It had to have been
the dark man.

14:12.393 --> 14:16.102
Who else could it be?

14:16.230 --> 14:17.436
- Thank you, Menchie.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.805
Thank you, Thornton.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.602
Thank you, Bart.
Thank you all for coming.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.726
Thank you.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.238
- Okay, well,
let's get to work

14:27.367 --> 14:31.235
looking for a tall, short,
thin, wide dark man,

14:31.371 --> 14:34.454
who may or may not
be carrying a sword.

14:36.459 --> 14:39.576
- Yes, you make
pretty pictures.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.122
But I don't want pretty.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.415
I want real.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.754
I want grungy.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.544
I want it to hurt.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.462
- Yes, you're a pain,
all right.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.586
- Mock away.
But photography is truth.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.428
It reveals things.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.672
It's how I roll.

14:52.809 --> 14:53.924
- Oh, please.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.391
- The only thing
your pictures reveal

14:55.520 --> 14:56.760
is your tortured soul.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.602
- At least I have a soul.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.971
- Yeah.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.348
- Ah.

15:01.484 --> 15:02.690
- Just the person
I was hoping for.

15:02.819 --> 15:03.934
- Hello.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.560
- We need you to settle
an argument.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.948
- Well, normally
I would love to, seriously,

15:08.074 --> 15:09.234
but actually
I was wondering

15:09.367 --> 15:10.652
if I could check
your archives.

15:10.785 --> 15:13.026
- Ah. Work before pleasure,
of course.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.493
- You know,
I actually used a computer

15:14.622 --> 15:15.737
a couple times in school.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.204
Do you care
if I give it a shot?

15:17.333 --> 15:18.869
- Well, of course you have.
I'm sorry.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.992
- Okay.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.498
- You know what
she's gonna pull up.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.090
- This'll be embarrassing.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.175
- So embarrassing.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.007
- It was a different time.

15:36.144 --> 15:39.011
- Maine was very short
on black people back then.

15:39.147 --> 15:42.105
- Haven had none,
to its detriment.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.019
- Does, uh...

15:44.152 --> 15:46.359
"Dark man" ring any bells
to you guys,

15:46.487 --> 15:48.728
maybe something
you didn't write about?

15:48.865 --> 15:50.480
- Sorry, no.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.901
- Me neither.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.650
- All right, well,
it was worth a try.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.449
Let's do some
real police work.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.294
- Two stabbings
in one week,

16:05.423 --> 16:07.630
and they both worked
at the medical center.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.840
- I know; I looked
into the cancer patients.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.426
27 deaths at the center
in the last three months.

16:12.555 --> 16:13.920
And 12 of those obituaries

16:14.056 --> 16:15.921
say they died
before their time.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.390
- But if patients are being
killed for some reason,

16:18.519 --> 16:20.055
maybe someone wants revenge.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.724
- Exactly.

16:21.856 --> 16:23.596
- Wait, is that what
you were actually thinking,

16:23.733 --> 16:25.394
or did you
just steal my idea?

16:25.526 --> 16:27.141
- Does it matter?

16:27.278 --> 16:29.189
All right, so Wilson
and Rand were stabbed, right?

16:29.322 --> 16:31.529
Do we know that all the patients
at the clinic died of cancer?

16:31.657 --> 16:33.158
Do we know that for sure?

16:33.284 --> 16:34.945
- They don't do autopsies
on cancer patients.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.568
- No, they don't,
but it's not too late.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.320
- You want to exhume them?

16:39.457 --> 16:40.993
- I mean, I don't want to.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.661
- We don't have enough
for a judge's order.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.169
- No, we don't.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.411
- Except
Beverly Jane McIntyre

16:46.547 --> 16:48.583
is Judge McIntyre's niece.

16:48.716 --> 16:51.674
My theory might convince her.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.463
You know, this is
gonna make us very unpopular

16:55.348 --> 16:57.179
- Yeah, but maybe when we
find out what's going on,

16:57.308 --> 16:58.468
they'll forgive us.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.216
I mean, I hope so.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.429
Hey, I thought you were
meeting with Jess tonight.

17:05.566 --> 17:09.024
- Yeah, I was until you talked
me into a pile of paperwork.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.689
- No, I can do this.

17:10.821 --> 17:12.402
I think we've established
that I don't have

17:12.532 --> 17:13.772
anybody waiting up for me.

17:13.908 --> 17:15.318
- No, it's fine.
I can see her tomorrow.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.657
- You don't want to go.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.492
- It's not that.

17:18.621 --> 17:19.781
- Know what,
you've been weird

17:19.914 --> 17:21.745
about this Jess thing
from the start.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.785
You have a beautiful woman
waiting up for you.

17:23.918 --> 17:26.284
You have a partner who's willing
to do the boring paperwork,

17:26.420 --> 17:28.502
and you still don't
want to go?

17:30.633 --> 17:32.373
Nathan, I wasn't gonna
say anything before,

17:32.510 --> 17:34.250
but it's not like you have
people calling you

17:34.387 --> 17:36.844
at all hours of the day
to hang out.

17:39.642 --> 17:43.134
Tell me.

17:43.271 --> 17:45.432
- [sighs]

17:47.900 --> 17:49.856
[shuts engine off]

17:49.986 --> 17:51.726
- Tell me.
Come on, what's going on?

17:51.862 --> 17:53.773
- I don't know if I can
make it happen.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.943
- Make what happen?

17:57.076 --> 17:59.067
Oh.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.370
Wait, this isn't
your first time, is it?

18:03.499 --> 18:05.035
- No.
- Is this your first time?

18:05.167 --> 18:06.498
Well, what--

18:06.627 --> 18:08.583
- It is my first time
since I've...

18:08.713 --> 18:10.374
been like this.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.248
I can't even feel
my own damn skin.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.874
I can't feel her skin.

18:15.011 --> 18:18.219
I don't know what else
I can't do.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.759
I don't...

18:20.891 --> 18:22.392
- Well, you should
just tell her.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.258
- Why?
What is she gonna say?

18:24.395 --> 18:26.681
- l don't--l don't think
she's gonna say anything.

18:28.149 --> 18:31.107
Listen, I'll--
I'll do this paperwork.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.691
You just go figure it out.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.732
- No, I should--
- You know what?

18:35.865 --> 18:38.356
You're welcome.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.660
- You seemed so nice.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.332
- I am nice.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.796
- How is exhuming
our families nice?

18:53.924 --> 18:55.209
- How did you know
about that?

18:55.343 --> 18:57.425
I just faxed that paperwork
an hour ago.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.054
- A friend of mine
works in that office.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.920
- I'm sorry.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.848
I really had no other choice.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.683
- You absolutely
had a choice.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.973
- If the dark man
killed your wife

19:09.106 --> 19:11.939
or anybody else,
we need to know how they died.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.901
I'm sorry,
but this is the only way.

19:15.029 --> 19:17.361
- If that's what it takes.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.106
But you shouldn't have gone
behind our backs.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.107
- I still don't like it.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.450
- Let's go, Thornton.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.490
Let's let the lady
do herjob.

19:34.632 --> 19:38.295
- I'm not saying
you need wine, but...

19:38.427 --> 19:40.679
I'm saying it wouldn't
be a bad idea.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.467
- It's that obvious, huh?

19:43.599 --> 19:46.887
- I know this isn't
your first date.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.226
- It feels like it.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.186
- [chuckles]

19:51.315 --> 19:54.432
[romantic music]

19:54.568 --> 19:56.149
J‘J‘

19:56.278 --> 19:59.441
- It is my first date
since I, um...

20:01.742 --> 20:04.279
Since I stopped
feeling anything.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.327
- Oh.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.121
Nathan, I'm so sorry.

20:13.254 --> 20:16.872
I didn't realize what
you were going through.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.918
I understand.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.258
Completely.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.679
- Well...

20:25.808 --> 20:29.801
okay, that makes
one of us.

20:29.937 --> 20:35.273
My stomach feels like, uh...

20:35.401 --> 20:39.986
when my dad caught me
with a girl in high school.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.572
- What was her name?

20:43.701 --> 20:44.986
- I believe it was Nicole

20:45.119 --> 20:46.404
he caught me with,

20:46.537 --> 20:48.493
first time anyway.

20:48.622 --> 20:50.123
- Nicole?

20:50.249 --> 20:52.035
- She was a good kisser.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.300
- Can you feel that?

21:03.429 --> 21:06.921
J‘J‘

21:07.057 --> 21:08.843
- No.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.433
- Let me try again.

21:11.562 --> 21:13.052
Nothing to lose.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.646
Everything to gain.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.731
Look at me this time.

21:17.860 --> 21:25.858
J‘J‘

21:27.745 --> 21:28.985
Don't stop looking at me.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.422
Now can you feel me?

21:53.813 --> 21:55.474
- Told you she would
still be here.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.562
- Oh, God, I hate it
when you're right.

21:57.691 --> 22:00.228
You should be in a bar
somewhere with your friends.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.898
- Or so I've been told.
What's going on?

22:03.030 --> 22:05.487
- Well, my brother and l
have a long-running argument

22:05.616 --> 22:07.402
about painting
and photography.

22:07.535 --> 22:08.775
- Did you come
all the way down here

22:08.911 --> 22:10.117
to have me
settle this for you?

22:10.246 --> 22:11.452
- No.
- Sort of.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.081
- I'd like to take
your picture.

22:13.207 --> 22:14.663
And Vince would like
to paint you.

22:14.792 --> 22:15.952
- And you choose
your favorite,

22:16.085 --> 22:17.746
and Dave will learn
to live with it.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.334
Eventually.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.795
- Is that gonna get you guys
to leave me alone?

22:21.924 --> 22:25.132
- Honestly?
Probably not.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.126
But I can paint
from the photo.

22:27.263 --> 22:28.594
It'll only take a minute.

22:28.722 --> 22:30.633
- Okay, fine.
Let's--let's do it.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.848
I mean, what else
do I have to do?

22:32.977 --> 22:35.810
- Just stand there
and be Audrey.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.053
- Is this good?

22:37.189 --> 22:39.020
- Maybe without
the weird smile.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.606
- Unbelievable.

22:41.735 --> 22:44.351
Jeez.

22:44.488 --> 22:45.773
- Beauty.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.484
Ah, nice.

22:53.831 --> 22:55.116
That's what they saw,
it's a shadow.

22:55.249 --> 22:57.365
That's the dark man.

22:57.501 --> 23:00.208
Hey, watch out.

23:00.337 --> 23:03.170
- Oh.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.631
- Is that shadow moving
on its own?

23:05.759 --> 23:07.465
- Yeah, it is.

23:07.595 --> 23:10.428
And I'm pretty sure that it
already killed two people.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.137
- Whoa.
- Turn out the lights.

23:12.266 --> 23:14.473
You can't have a shadow
without any light, right?

23:14.602 --> 23:16.684
- Well, how do you know that's
the way this shadow works?

23:16.812 --> 23:18.393
- I don't know.
I'm just making it up, okay?

23:18.522 --> 23:20.854
Just do it.
- All right.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.905
- Look.

23:27.031 --> 23:28.942
It does need the light.
It can't move without it.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.451
- It's too dark for it
to come over here, right?

23:34.580 --> 23:36.116
- Yeah, that's what
I'm thinking.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.784
- I still don't know
how you can know that.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.657
- It's in my supernatural
shadow guide.

23:39.793 --> 23:42.876
It says, hold on, yep.

23:44.840 --> 23:48.378
We're screwed.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.721
- You ready to try this?

24:02.942 --> 24:06.651
Oh, never mind.
You're ready.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.894
[cell phone rings]

24:08.030 --> 24:10.692
Don't get it.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.405
- I need to see who it is.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.661
- Why?
It's Audrey.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.152
It's always Audrey.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.494
You'll answer it,

24:17.623 --> 24:21.707
and after that
you'll be gone.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.668
[ringing continues]

24:25.923 --> 24:27.254
Fine, answer it.

24:27.383 --> 24:28.919
- [murmurs]

24:29.051 --> 24:31.258
- Promise me we'll
pick this up again tomorrow.

24:31.387 --> 24:33.093
- Promise.

24:43.357 --> 24:45.188
- Parker?

24:45.317 --> 24:47.353
- Nathan?

24:47.486 --> 24:49.647
- Parker?
- Yeah.

24:53.033 --> 24:56.070
- Nathan,
it's right over there.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.318
- Yeah.

24:57.454 --> 24:59.490
- What the hell is that?

25:11.260 --> 25:14.093
I think it's gone.

25:14.221 --> 25:16.086
- Okay then.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.838
Now we know what
the dark man is.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.556
- Yes, we do.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.721
- Yeah, and why everybody
described him differently.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.186
- Shadows change shape
depending on the light.

25:24.314 --> 25:25.599
But why'd he come after you?

25:25.733 --> 25:27.189
- Beats me.

25:27.317 --> 25:30.275
Do you think it's what killed
Wilson and Rand?

25:30.404 --> 25:31.769
- Maybe.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.611
- Dave, I need you
to download those images.

25:33.741 --> 25:35.447
There might be a picture
of the shadow on there.

25:35.576 --> 25:36.691
- He can't download them.

25:36.827 --> 25:38.192
- Oh, well, Nathan
can just show--

25:38.328 --> 25:40.319
- No, I know how to download.
I shoot on film.

25:40.456 --> 25:41.571
Warmer tones.

25:41.707 --> 25:43.038
- It's how he rolls.

25:43.167 --> 25:45.158
- Okay, all right.
That's great, good.

25:45.294 --> 25:46.579
So when can you get us
the images?

25:46.712 --> 25:48.077
- Target opens at 9:00,
I think.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.750
- Okay, all right.

25:50.883 --> 25:53.499
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

25:54.762 --> 25:56.127
- Listen, I'm sorry if I,

25:56.263 --> 25:58.094
you know, interrupted
anything with Jess.

25:58.223 --> 26:01.932
- No, no, no,
you had a good reason.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.892
- Yeah, it was
a pretty good reason.

26:05.731 --> 26:08.973
So did, uh, anything happen

26:09.109 --> 26:10.224
with Jess?

26:10.360 --> 26:12.521
- It was about to.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.781
- I'm sorry again.
Sorry.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.746
- "Some shall be pardoned
and some punished.

26:24.875 --> 26:27.708
"For never was a story
of more woe

26:27.836 --> 26:30.543
than this of Juliet
and her Romeo."

26:30.672 --> 26:32.799
- That was it.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.132
Sarabeth's favorite,
I don't know why.

26:35.260 --> 26:38.252
- Too sad for you?
- No, no, it was too long.

26:38.388 --> 26:39.764
[both chuckle]

26:39.890 --> 26:42.381
It's nice hearing it again.
Thank you.

26:44.061 --> 26:45.471
- How are you doing,
Thornton?

26:45.604 --> 26:49.017
- Hanging in there.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.481
Some days are better
than others but...

26:51.610 --> 26:53.817
- Of course.

26:53.946 --> 26:57.655
And how did you manage to take
care of Sarabeth at the end?

26:57.783 --> 26:59.319
- Well, she went so quickly,

26:59.451 --> 27:01.863
I didn't have to do much.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.486
See, the doctor gave her
a year or more.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.329
We planned to do
all these things.

27:06.458 --> 27:11.498
And--and then in a month,
she was gone.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.586
- Menchie's son
died quickly too?

27:13.715 --> 27:14.841
- Yeah.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.673
- Do you guys talk about it?

27:16.802 --> 27:18.963
- You kidding?
It's all we talk about.

27:22.349 --> 27:25.216
- Mind if I help myself
to a glass of water?

27:25.352 --> 27:27.013
- Oh, no, go ahead.
- Do you want some?

27:27.146 --> 27:30.183
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.

27:30.315 --> 27:31.930
- Got you your favorite,
Nathan.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.228
Extra whipped cream
and double caramel.

27:34.361 --> 27:36.022
All right, so what do
those reports say?

27:36.155 --> 27:37.941
- That these people all died
of the same thing.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.233
Cancer.

27:39.366 --> 27:40.481
- So not the shadow then.

27:40.617 --> 27:41.868
- Well, there is
something missing

27:41.994 --> 27:43.109
from the tox screen, though.

27:43.245 --> 27:44.451
- What?

27:44.580 --> 27:46.195
- Adriamycin,
bleomycin, herceptin.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.867
- Chemotherapy drugs.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.537
- The levels are either
too low or nonexistent.

27:50.669 --> 27:51.875
- They weren't being treated?

27:52.004 --> 27:53.289
- Well, maybe
with chamomile tea,

27:53.422 --> 27:55.037
but not with conventional
chemotherapy.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.210
- So then they would have
died before their time.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.878
- Well, not surprising.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.547
Untreated cancers
can kill you quickly.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.135
- Right, but what
would be the benefit

28:02.264 --> 28:03.470
to not treating them?

28:03.599 --> 28:04.839
- Beats me.

28:04.975 --> 28:06.465
That's your department,
isn't it?

28:27.080 --> 28:29.332
- Jess, you okay in there?

28:31.543 --> 28:33.534
- You see that?

28:35.631 --> 28:37.542
- That looks like
a long knife.

28:37.674 --> 28:38.789
- It's what killed Rand.

28:38.926 --> 28:40.462
- And Wilson.

28:40.594 --> 28:43.006
This is the knife
that can bend behind a couch.

28:43.138 --> 28:45.094
- Yeah, but look what's
happening in every photo.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.017
- What does all this have
to do with untreated cancer?

28:51.146 --> 28:52.932
- Don't know.
- Me neither.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.271
- It's not
a coincidence, though.

28:54.399 --> 28:55.935
- Yeah, not in Haven.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.854
All right,
what would be the motive

28:57.986 --> 28:59.851
to not treat patients?

28:59.988 --> 29:01.489
- Let's say money.

29:01.615 --> 29:03.446
Maybe Rand
withheld chemotherapy.

29:03.575 --> 29:04.690
He was a nurse.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.441
It would be easy
to switch bags.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.694
- And Wilson could have sold
the drugs to other clinics.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.957
Weren't all those travel
brochures at Wilson's house,

29:11.083 --> 29:12.289
weren't they
for spendy places?

29:12.417 --> 29:13.748
- Yes, they were.

29:13.877 --> 29:16.118
We need to see
Wilson's bank records.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.961
- Hey, you're kind of smart.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.251
- Kind of?

29:25.222 --> 29:28.510
- I see you haven't thrown away
Sarabeth's medicines yet.

29:28.642 --> 29:29.802
- Yeah, I know
I'm supposed to.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.516
I just like
having them around.

29:31.645 --> 29:34.387
Makes me, you know, feel like
she still lives here.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.730
- I understand.

29:36.858 --> 29:40.476
But these bottles are full.
- Yeah.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.273
- If she wasn't taking
her medications,

29:42.406 --> 29:44.397
how was she tolerating
the side effects of chemo?

29:44.533 --> 29:45.943
- Well, she never had
any side effects.

29:46.076 --> 29:47.407
- Really?

29:47.536 --> 29:49.276
- Yeah, I guess we just
felt lucky that way.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.952
- I'm off.

29:59.172 --> 30:00.708
I'll see you at the center,
right?

30:00.841 --> 30:02.172
- Yep.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.973
- Bank confirms Wilson
had large cash deposits

30:12.102 --> 30:13.467
going back several months.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.139
- Still doesn't link her
to Rand, though.

30:15.272 --> 30:17.228
- Same amounts on the same
dates in Rand's account.

30:17.357 --> 30:20.315
- Oh, well, that does.

30:20.444 --> 30:24.357
So Rand and Wilson were
stealing chemo from patients?

30:24.489 --> 30:27.026
God, there's got to be
a special room in hell for that.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.024
- And the shadow found out
what they were up to

30:29.161 --> 30:30.446
and killed them.

30:30.579 --> 30:33.286
- But then why would it
attack me?

30:33.415 --> 30:36.999
[cell phone rings]

30:37.127 --> 30:38.242
- Hi.

30:38.378 --> 30:41.120
I'm sort of busy right now.

30:41.256 --> 30:42.917
- It's important.
- Okay.

30:43.050 --> 30:44.711
- I think I know
why the center patients

30:44.843 --> 30:47.255
were dying prematurely,
and l have proof.

30:47.387 --> 30:48.968
- What do you mean?
- None of the patients

30:49.097 --> 30:51.213
were taking
their side effects medication.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.261
I don't think they were
getting their chemo.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.224
- Where are you?
- Home. Why?

30:55.354 --> 30:56.469
- Just stay there.
I'm on my way.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.061
- But why?
I'm fine.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.101
- Jess, people close
to this have died.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.565
Stay right there.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.230
- Wait, Nathan.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.022
Hey!
Talk to me.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.827
- Damn.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.592
[line trilling]
- Hello.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.383
- Menchie, I think Jess
came into our houses

31:32.516 --> 31:36.259
for only one reason,
and it wasn't therapy.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.068
- Hello?

31:57.916 --> 31:59.452
[phone beeping]

31:59.584 --> 32:01.666
Anybody there?

32:01.795 --> 32:03.376
- Jess, is that you?

32:03.505 --> 32:05.962
- Nathan, I think there's
somebody in the house.

32:06.091 --> 32:10.460
Jess, okay, please listen
to me closely.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.052
Find a closet, get in,
and close the door.

32:13.181 --> 32:15.968
[Jess screams]

32:16.101 --> 32:18.592
Jess? Jess?

32:21.940 --> 32:23.225
Jess?

32:30.782 --> 32:33.364
Jess.

32:33.493 --> 32:35.575
Jess?
- Nathan.

32:52.637 --> 32:54.013
- Nathan, she'll be okay.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.504
Why don't you just
go to the hospital?

32:55.640 --> 32:57.141
- I will.

32:57.267 --> 32:59.098
I just--l want to figure out
what happened first.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.342
- Nathan.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.686
- My job is to stop
this thing

33:02.814 --> 33:05.806
before it hurts
someone else.

33:09.404 --> 33:10.860
Okay, someone knew--

33:10.989 --> 33:12.399
someone knew
that she had taken these.

33:12.532 --> 33:15.524
Maybe that same someone
sent the shadow after her.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.652
- Sarabeth Arrons.
- That's Thornton's wife.

33:18.788 --> 33:20.779
- Okay, no, you know what,
I'll go talk to Thornton,

33:22.918 --> 33:24.158
- You can come along
if you want.

33:24.294 --> 33:25.659
- No, Nathan,
that is a bad idea.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.296
- Yeah, maybe,
but it's what I'm doing.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.253
So you can come or not.
- Fine.

33:29.382 --> 33:30.588
But I want your gun.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.958
- [scoffs]

33:33.094 --> 33:35.130
- That's the only way
this is gonna happen.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.366
- Just...

34:00.997 --> 34:02.112
- You see that?

34:02.249 --> 34:03.534
See his cane?

34:03.667 --> 34:04.952
That could be
the shadoW's sword.

34:05.085 --> 34:07.451
- Yeah, or it could
just be a cane.

34:07.587 --> 34:09.043
Wait.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.880
Look at that.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.591
- He doesn't have a shadow.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.634
- Yeah, but where is it?

34:26.022 --> 34:27.523
- Only one way to find out.

34:27.649 --> 34:29.605
- Okay, and by that you mean
talking to him, right?

34:29.734 --> 34:31.315
- Yes.

34:31.444 --> 34:33.435
- Because if it is his shadow
that's doing this,

34:33.572 --> 34:34.778
confronting him
in the light

34:34.906 --> 34:36.771
would be a really bad idea,
right?

34:36.908 --> 34:38.523
- Yeah.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.661
- What's this about, Officer?

34:42.789 --> 34:45.405
- We know about
the dark man.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.325
- You caught him?

34:48.461 --> 34:49.621
- You know who it is.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.290
- No, I don't.
No one knows.

34:51.423 --> 34:53.038
- He could be telling
the truth, all right?

34:53.174 --> 34:54.380
- You don't know that.

34:54.509 --> 34:55.874
- Yeah, but if he is,

34:56.011 --> 34:57.797
we need to handle this
carefully, okay?

34:57.929 --> 34:59.544
So just back me up on this.

34:59.681 --> 35:03.299
No, Nathan,
back me up on this.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.055
- Fine.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.231
- It was the center
that killed your wife.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.476
We think that they were
stealing medications

35:14.613 --> 35:15.944
that she was
supposed to get.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.573
- Oh, no.

35:17.699 --> 35:19.735
- We have the people responsible
for this in custody

35:19.868 --> 35:21.153
at the station right now.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.868
- I want them
held accountable.

35:23.997 --> 35:26.329
- That's what
we're counting on.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.035
Hey, would you like
to go to coffee?

35:32.172 --> 35:34.879
You would?
Great.

35:35.008 --> 35:36.589
And then, you know,
you can tell me

35:36.718 --> 35:38.003
about your brilliant kids,

35:38.136 --> 35:40.172
and I can pretend
to be interested.

35:40.305 --> 35:43.172
And then I'll tell you about
my something that I read,

35:43.308 --> 35:45.173
but then, you know,
pretty soon,

35:45.310 --> 35:47.471
I'll just want
to freaking kill myself.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.020
- You think I believe
you didn't know

35:51.149 --> 35:52.264
your shadow
was the dark man?

35:52.400 --> 35:53.515
- How could I know?

35:53.652 --> 35:54.767
I can't even wrap my head

35:54.903 --> 35:56.188
around what you just told me.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.528
You said
that it attacked you?

35:58.657 --> 36:01.194
- I saw him
attack my partner

36:01.326 --> 36:04.534
right after you found out
she was exhuming your wife.

36:04.663 --> 36:08.702
- I was furious at her.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.334
It didn't go after
any of the patients

36:10.460 --> 36:11.620
at the center, though,
did it?

36:11.753 --> 36:13.038
- We think he was just there

36:13.171 --> 36:15.036
looking for
your wife's killer.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.879
- When they told me
that Sarabeth had died,

36:20.011 --> 36:21.626
I felt the world
crash in on me,

36:21.763 --> 36:24.630
and then I felt it lift.

36:24.766 --> 36:26.097
The rage and the sadness,

36:26.226 --> 36:28.057
it just left me and--

36:28.186 --> 36:30.427
and I felt like
a new person.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.178
Maybe when my shadow left me,

36:32.315 --> 36:34.271
it took those feelings
with him.

36:34.401 --> 36:37.609
- Maybe.

36:37.737 --> 36:41.901
- Those other people
had it coming, though.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.648
- Excuse me?

36:43.785 --> 36:46.822
- Those other people who
took Sarabeth's time from her.

36:46.955 --> 36:48.866
I'm not crying for them.

36:50.333 --> 36:52.745
- What about Jess?

36:52.877 --> 36:56.085
Hmm?

36:56.214 --> 36:57.579
You gonna cry for her?

36:57.716 --> 36:59.502
- Why?
What happened?

37:01.720 --> 37:04.177
Oh, no.

37:04.305 --> 37:06.261
ls--

37:06.391 --> 37:08.256
is she dead?

37:08.393 --> 37:10.679
- She's in the hospital
because of you.

37:10.812 --> 37:12.018
- Nol

37:12.147 --> 37:14.263
Not me.

37:14.399 --> 37:17.516
Not me!

37:19.738 --> 37:21.694
But...

37:21.823 --> 37:23.279
I guess it was him,

37:23.408 --> 37:24.818
because when I thought

37:24.951 --> 37:27.192
that she was stealing
Sarabeth's drugs,

37:27.328 --> 37:29.114
I got angry,
and maybe he felt that,

37:29.247 --> 37:31.238
and he went after her.

37:33.668 --> 37:36.080
I'm sorry.
I can't control him.

37:41.009 --> 37:43.546
You should kill me.

37:43.678 --> 37:46.761
Kill me and maybe it will--

37:46.890 --> 37:48.801
it will kill him too.

37:50.518 --> 37:53.134
- Maybe it will.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.689
- Oh, my favorite movie.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.857
Um...

38:03.990 --> 38:07.278
l--l don't think I have
a favorite movie.

38:07.410 --> 38:10.026
Do you?

38:10.163 --> 38:11.448
Seriously?

38:11.581 --> 38:13.788
Whew.

38:31.935 --> 38:34.142
All right.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.806
Okay.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.685
Yeah, it's gone.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.650
Just make sure
it doesn't come back.

38:46.366 --> 38:48.322
- So you, uh--

38:48.451 --> 38:49.736
you're gonna kill me now?

38:49.869 --> 38:53.157
- I can't do that.

38:53.289 --> 38:56.076
I promised my partner.

38:56.209 --> 38:57.665
- Why are you still here
talking to me?

38:57.794 --> 39:01.412
- Need to see
if your shadow comes back.

39:01.548 --> 39:04.381
- And when it does,
are you putting me away?

39:15.728 --> 39:17.013
- Not just you.

39:17.146 --> 39:19.933
Your shadow.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.425
Nonfat mocha almond latte

39:52.557 --> 39:53.717
with a dusting of cinnamon.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.090
- I was gonna call you.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.511
- About?

39:59.689 --> 40:01.771
What's going on?

40:01.900 --> 40:03.015
- I'm
9
oin
9

40:03.151 --> 40:05.437
To Montreal.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.185
- That makes sense.

40:07.322 --> 40:10.405
A trip will clear your head.

40:10.533 --> 40:12.774
I could probably get
a few days off work

40:12.911 --> 40:16.870
if you want company.

40:16.998 --> 40:18.113
Or not.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.285
- It's not just a trip.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.919
- You're not coming back?

40:22.045 --> 40:23.410
- I don't want to go, Nathan.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.662
But there are all these
things happening here

40:25.798 --> 40:27.208
in Haven, the troubles.

40:27.342 --> 40:29.128
I can't be here,
not after--

40:29.260 --> 40:31.797
- I could, um...

40:31.930 --> 40:35.093
- These things have
a way of finding you.

40:35.224 --> 40:37.806
I'm sorry.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.097
I wish I was stronger.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.252
[pounding on door]

41:12.553 --> 41:14.009
- Hey, spill it.

41:14.138 --> 41:15.844
You didn't say one word
on the ride over here,

41:15.974 --> 41:17.339
and even for you
that's quiet.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.215
- Ah, it's nothing.
I'm fine.

41:19.352 --> 41:20.592
- No, what's wrong?

41:20.728 --> 41:22.013
ls Jess okay?

41:22.146 --> 41:24.307
- She's fine.
She left.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.055
- She left?

41:26.192 --> 41:27.523
- Not coming back.

41:27.652 --> 41:30.519
- Oh, Nathan.

41:30.655 --> 41:32.862
I am so--l'm so sorry.

41:32.991 --> 41:35.232
- It was bound to happen
sometime.

41:40.832 --> 41:44.074
- Hey, you know
that whole friends thing?

41:44.210 --> 41:46.622
You were right.
|__

41:46.754 --> 41:49.587
I don't think
I ever really had any.

41:51.509 --> 41:55.343
But I do now.

41:55.471 --> 41:57.928
And so do you.
