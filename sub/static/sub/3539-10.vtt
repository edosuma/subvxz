[Madame Kali] <i>She's the one
the Master seeks above all.</i>

00:04.370 --> 00:06.203
What do you want of me?

00:06.205 --> 00:08.705
Sometimes you tie a lamb
to lure a lion.

00:08.707 --> 00:10.807
The Wolf of God.

00:10.809 --> 00:13.076
<i>Stand alongside
the great winged Lucifer</i>

00:13.078 --> 00:15.712
<i>as he reconquers
heaven's bloody throne.</i>

00:15.714 --> 00:18.582
[Lily] <i>My beloved immortal.</i>

00:18.584 --> 00:21.285
This sad little world is ours.

00:21.287 --> 00:23.219
[Lavinia] Let's go explore
what Father's been building.

00:25.289 --> 00:27.023
[Octavia]
<i>Animals are right in cages.</i>

00:27.025 --> 00:28.391
You can't keep me here.

00:28.393 --> 00:29.726
But of course we can.

00:29.728 --> 00:30.960
[Rusk] <i>Ethan Talbot.</i>

00:30.962 --> 00:32.762
<i>You will not take
one step from this house</i>

00:32.764 --> 00:33.930
<i>when you will not be observed.</i>

00:33.932 --> 00:36.632
Cornered animals
are the most dangerous.

00:36.634 --> 00:38.068
But they are cornered,
nonetheless.

00:38.070 --> 00:39.802
- You're not real.
- [laughing]

00:39.804 --> 00:40.936
You're not here.

00:40.938 --> 00:42.104
[Frankenstein]
<i>Sir Malcolm's in trouble.</i>

00:42.106 --> 00:43.706
I will not
let him suffer alone.

00:43.708 --> 00:47.142
What if Miss Ives should prove
stronger than you think?

00:47.144 --> 00:48.977
If I were of
another constitution,

00:48.979 --> 00:50.713
I would fear you.

00:50.715 --> 00:51.847
She's gone.

00:51.849 --> 00:53.749
Oh, for fuck's sake!
Get the others!

00:53.751 --> 00:55.150
[Lyle] <i>You have no idea</i>

00:55.152 --> 00:56.885
<i>what hell
you are stepping into.</i>

00:56.887 --> 00:59.121
Welcome to my home, Miss Ives.

00:59.123 --> 01:01.190
- [gasps]
- [hisses]

01:01.192 --> 01:03.325
- Sir Malcolm...
- [gasps]

01:03.327 --> 01:04.626
It's Doctor Frankenstein.

01:04.628 --> 01:06.195
[Creature] Father.

01:06.197 --> 01:07.562
Your children have returned.

01:10.133 --> 01:11.200
[Ethan] <i>I can't stop it!</i>

01:11.202 --> 01:12.534
[snarling]

01:14.169 --> 01:16.271
I need to see
Sir Malcolm immediately.

01:16.273 --> 01:18.440
There's someone else
you need to see first.

01:18.442 --> 01:20.475
[Vanessa]
<i>So, I'm to meet your Master?</i>

01:20.477 --> 01:22.344
[Madame Kali]
<i>He's your Master as well.</i>

01:25.180 --> 01:26.548
Murderer.

03:14.386 --> 03:16.254
[Vanessa dummy] Murderer.

03:16.256 --> 03:18.323
How many scattered corpses
will you leave

03:18.325 --> 03:19.724
in your bloody wake

03:19.726 --> 03:21.860
before your life
has run its course?

03:21.862 --> 03:25.663
A hundred? A thousand? A race?

03:26.965 --> 03:29.667
Or will it be all of mankind
we devour?

03:36.241 --> 03:38.709
And you speak
for the Fallen Angel?

03:38.711 --> 03:40.778
"The Fallen Angel."

03:40.780 --> 03:42.980
Much the most
gentle appellation

03:42.982 --> 03:45.048
you could give me, beloved.

03:46.384 --> 03:47.751
Beloved, is it?

03:48.853 --> 03:51.755
Don't deny what you know
to be true, Amunet.

03:56.294 --> 03:58.428
And all of this...

03:58.430 --> 04:01.330
the witches, the attacks...

04:01.332 --> 04:02.866
just to bring me here.

04:03.967 --> 04:06.035
I've missed you, Vanessa.

04:09.573 --> 04:10.607
No.

04:13.343 --> 04:15.244
No, you need me to agree.

04:16.613 --> 04:18.647
You can't take my soul.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.149
I have to give it.

04:20.151 --> 04:21.617
[Vanessa dummy]
You must give it, freely,

04:21.619 --> 04:24.120
and of your own accord.

04:24.122 --> 04:25.788
I do not snatch tributes

04:25.790 --> 04:28.524
like a starving slave
grasping for bones.

04:30.493 --> 04:34.195
And for this carnival trickery
he promises you eternal youth?

04:34.197 --> 04:35.363
Nay...

04:36.666 --> 04:38.199
delivers.

04:38.201 --> 04:40.969
Can your vanity so blind you
to his duplicity?

04:42.071 --> 04:43.839
He is the Father of Lies.

04:43.841 --> 04:45.674
[Madame Kali]
Who's the liar here?

04:45.676 --> 04:47.042
You claim to stand
with the angel

04:47.044 --> 04:50.511
while your every action
speaks otherwise.

04:50.513 --> 04:51.879
[Vanessa dummy]
What is your life

04:51.881 --> 04:56.084
but a catalog of depravity,
betrayal, and now homicide?

04:56.086 --> 04:57.885
I will not compound my guilt

04:57.887 --> 05:00.155
by accepting
your ministrations.

05:00.157 --> 05:01.957
But you already have.

05:01.959 --> 05:03.925
The moment you opened
your mouth

05:03.927 --> 05:05.927
and spoke the Verbis Diablo.

05:05.929 --> 05:08.262
The moment you stretched
your midnight powers

05:08.264 --> 05:10.397
to take the life of another.

05:10.399 --> 05:11.899
[Vanessa dummy]
At that moment,

05:11.901 --> 05:15.035
you took me in your arms
and kissed me deep.

05:16.137 --> 05:18.873
Kiss me now and end the pain.

05:20.141 --> 05:21.842
My soul is mine...

05:21.844 --> 05:24.244
that part of God is mine!

05:24.246 --> 05:25.312
God has turned
his back on you.

05:26.414 --> 05:29.249
Church, God,
Ministers of Grace.

05:29.251 --> 05:31.118
You've left them behind,
you know you have.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.319
No!

05:32.321 --> 05:34.455
All of that is behind you,

05:34.457 --> 05:36.390
but what lies ahead?

05:39.326 --> 05:40.660
Think of it.

05:41.762 --> 05:43.597
All of time.

05:43.599 --> 05:45.932
All of history.

05:45.934 --> 05:48.434
Everlasting power
to rule the darkness

05:48.436 --> 05:51.738
with he who loves you,
and will never reject you.

05:54.074 --> 05:56.342
You have no power to tempt me.

05:56.344 --> 05:59.178
I have faced eyes
more cruel than yours, woman.

06:01.081 --> 06:02.248
[Vanessa dummy]
Then face mine.

06:04.684 --> 06:06.219
Face yourself.

06:08.588 --> 06:12.558
There is no more powerful
inducement to me than this.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.493
Know yourself.

06:18.665 --> 06:20.098
[hissing]

06:24.437 --> 06:26.838
[thunder rumbling]

06:26.840 --> 06:29.741
[Proteus]
Like a lamb I was, Victor.

06:29.743 --> 06:31.576
How could you let me be hurt?

06:33.212 --> 06:36.848
Him. It was him.

06:36.850 --> 06:39.151
What am I
but an extension of you?

06:40.286 --> 06:42.587
All your sin emptied into me.

06:44.023 --> 06:46.390
I'm your other half...

06:46.392 --> 06:48.426
- your truest self.
- [thunder cracking]

06:48.428 --> 06:50.695
[Lily]
Don't blame the children

06:50.697 --> 06:52.030
for the father's cruelty.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.634
[Proteus]
We were born innocent.

06:57.803 --> 07:00.037
You made us into monsters.

07:02.307 --> 07:04.341
[Gladys] I don't know how
you can live with it, Malcolm.

07:04.343 --> 07:06.777
[Mina] All those tombstones
in a row.

07:06.779 --> 07:09.280
Wife, daughter, son.

07:09.282 --> 07:10.714
Not me. Not my doing.

07:10.716 --> 07:12.183
You know it was.

07:12.185 --> 07:14.552
Who walked away as I starved?

07:14.554 --> 07:15.919
Who pulled the trigger
that killed me, Father?

07:15.921 --> 07:17.420
Did you name a mountain
after me?

07:17.422 --> 07:20.090
Did you enjoy her body
as I bled?

07:20.092 --> 07:22.092
Did we ask for this life?

07:23.294 --> 07:25.095
Or was it your pride?

07:26.530 --> 07:29.933
To conquer death is...
an ennobled calling.

07:31.402 --> 07:33.103
I am a scientist.

07:35.272 --> 07:36.772
A scientist.

07:36.774 --> 07:39.375
And when you touched
my naked body?

07:39.377 --> 07:42.145
Your fingertips
running along my flesh.

07:42.147 --> 07:44.247
This was abuse...

07:44.249 --> 07:45.648
not science.

07:47.618 --> 07:49.451
[Proteus] I was your friend.

07:51.021 --> 07:52.955
I never had another.

07:52.957 --> 07:56.092
You walked away
at the moment of my birth.

08:00.030 --> 08:02.364
[Sir Malcolm]
The past is dead.

08:06.436 --> 08:08.570
I cannot remake what's done.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.805
Come to the graveyard
on the hill

08:10.807 --> 08:12.807
and tell me the past is dead.

08:12.809 --> 08:13.975
[Peter] Touch the tombstones.

08:13.977 --> 08:15.511
We're still warm.

08:15.513 --> 08:17.613
And so we walk
with your sin...

08:18.714 --> 08:19.914
dead...

08:19.916 --> 08:21.816
and yet not fully alive.

08:22.918 --> 08:25.020
Haunting the twilight,

08:25.022 --> 08:26.420
living between.

08:31.426 --> 08:33.628
This is what you have made,
Victor.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.398
If I could go back...

08:39.467 --> 08:40.900
it would be different.

08:40.903 --> 08:43.304
Live my life again,
I would do such other things.

08:44.406 --> 08:48.709
Husband...
life only leads forward.

08:48.711 --> 08:51.646
There is no going back,
Creator.

08:51.648 --> 08:53.447
There is only
this moment on, Father.

08:54.550 --> 08:56.650
That's what you taught me.

08:56.652 --> 08:59.419
Intrepidly moving forward
no matter the obstacles.

08:59.421 --> 09:01.021
Explorers.

09:02.490 --> 09:06.293
[Creature] You are a man
who discovers new worlds,

09:06.295 --> 09:08.295
always grasping for tomorrow.

09:10.098 --> 09:12.199
[Proteus]
So will you do that now?

09:15.503 --> 09:17.036
How will you atone?

09:17.038 --> 09:19.972
What peace can there be
without atonement?

09:22.176 --> 09:23.243
How?

09:23.245 --> 09:25.612
[Sir Malcolm]
What would you have me do?

09:28.782 --> 09:31.951
You have the engines
of the future all around you.

09:31.953 --> 09:32.952
[Lily] The needle.

09:34.755 --> 09:37.423
The scalpel. The noose.

09:37.425 --> 09:39.225
The gun to the temple.

09:39.227 --> 09:41.327
Take your razor
and slit your throat.

09:41.329 --> 09:43.062
Join your family.

09:43.064 --> 09:44.763
A final tombstone on the hill.

09:46.132 --> 09:48.834
The sip of poison
from the amber bottle.

09:50.437 --> 09:51.704
A single bullet

09:51.706 --> 09:53.272
under the chin.

09:54.941 --> 09:57.943
There is no other peace
for thee, Frankenstein.

09:59.045 --> 10:01.246
Walk into the river...

10:01.248 --> 10:03.215
let it bring you quiet.

10:04.851 --> 10:07.119
Enjoy our company.

10:07.121 --> 10:08.920
One of us again.

10:08.922 --> 10:10.255
Father.

10:10.257 --> 10:11.857
[Gladys] Husband.

10:11.859 --> 10:12.891
Father.

10:14.127 --> 10:15.426
Lover.

10:16.896 --> 10:18.730
Brother.

10:18.732 --> 10:21.065
Come home. Please.

10:31.176 --> 10:32.377
End it.

10:34.646 --> 10:35.980
[Vanessa] <i>You can't tempt me.</i>

10:37.548 --> 10:39.549
You can take my body,

10:39.551 --> 10:41.252
but my soul is my own.

10:42.353 --> 10:44.889
Not one thing you seek?

10:44.891 --> 10:46.957
Not one jewel...

10:46.959 --> 10:49.927
you prize above all others?

10:49.929 --> 10:53.797
[Vanessa dummy] Yes.
There is an old dream in you.

10:53.799 --> 10:55.131
A deep longing.

10:56.301 --> 10:58.101
- You know it.
- No.

10:59.537 --> 11:01.037
Let me show you
what I can give you.

11:02.139 --> 11:03.907
No.

11:03.909 --> 11:05.475
[Vanessa dummy]
To be free of pain.

11:05.477 --> 11:09.378
To be loved,
simply for who you are.

11:09.380 --> 11:12.115
Is that not the engine
of all human creatures?

11:13.217 --> 11:15.218
To be normal.

11:44.513 --> 11:45.780
[gasps]

11:45.782 --> 11:49.584
Mother, I don't understand
why Charles is so awful to me.

11:50.686 --> 11:52.054
We were drawing pictures

11:52.056 --> 11:54.256
and I made fun
of her silly horse.

11:54.258 --> 11:55.523
It wasn't silly!

11:55.525 --> 11:56.958
Well, it looked
like a hippopotamus,

11:56.960 --> 11:57.925
doesn't it, Clare?

11:59.027 --> 12:00.762
I'm sure it doesn't.

12:00.764 --> 12:02.196
No, it really does.

12:02.198 --> 12:03.231
Charles!

12:04.333 --> 12:05.333
Morning, Van.

12:06.869 --> 12:08.970
Sorry,
I got lost in the paper.

12:08.972 --> 12:10.839
[Charles] Ew! Don't kiss!

12:15.244 --> 12:16.844
We were drawing horses.

12:16.846 --> 12:18.346
[Charles] And hippopotami.

12:19.481 --> 12:22.383
- Charles!
- [Ethan] Horses, is it?

12:22.385 --> 12:23.885
Well, you know, I've seen
a few of those in my day.

12:25.354 --> 12:28.789
Tell you what, go get 'em,
give me a look,

12:28.791 --> 12:30.457
and I'll judge
their authenticity.

12:38.933 --> 12:40.066
Ethan.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.704
Why are you looking at me
like that?

12:45.306 --> 12:47.941
Nothing. No reason.

12:51.578 --> 12:54.080
I'm sorry, you're right.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.083
Sundays are for family.

12:58.419 --> 13:00.020
Speaking of which...

13:03.524 --> 13:05.525
Let's send the kids
to the park.

13:05.527 --> 13:06.992
- Ethan.
- Just for an hour.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.093
Stop it.

13:08.095 --> 13:10.195
I thought you wanted
a whole brood of kids?

13:10.197 --> 13:11.798
You know perfectly well

13:11.800 --> 13:13.499
that Mina and Jonathan
are coming to tea.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.835
Oh, not for hours and hours.

13:30.951 --> 13:33.752
Daddy, does this
look like a hippopotamus?

13:35.288 --> 13:38.189
Not at all.
Maybe it looks like

13:38.191 --> 13:39.958
a horse that's eaten
a little too much.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.927
[Clare] I like fat horses.

13:41.929 --> 13:44.162
[Charles]
Fat horses are too slow.

13:44.164 --> 13:45.664
[Ethan]
Not if you're on a long trail.

13:45.666 --> 13:47.732
You want a little
extra muscle then.

13:47.734 --> 13:49.033
Take the pioneers,

13:49.035 --> 13:51.870
they had to ride
clear across the country.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.372
They couldn't stop
a horse carriage to...

13:54.374 --> 13:56.140
[voices fading]

14:12.123 --> 14:14.057
You're very cruel.

14:14.059 --> 14:15.025
[Vanessa dummy] No, Vanessa.

14:16.127 --> 14:18.095
This is kindness.

14:18.097 --> 14:20.498
It's what you truly want,
isn't it?

14:24.435 --> 14:26.370
[thunder cracking]

14:26.372 --> 14:29.739
[Lily] One last,
great experiment, Victor.

14:30.841 --> 14:33.343
The greatest of all.

14:33.345 --> 14:35.312
[Mina] One last expedition
into the unknown,

14:35.314 --> 14:36.846
Father.

14:36.848 --> 14:38.415
Terra Incognito.

14:38.417 --> 14:40.350
[Mina] Magical words.

14:40.352 --> 14:42.519
Piercing the tissue
that separates

14:42.521 --> 14:43.920
life from death.

14:45.022 --> 14:48.190
Your mission. Your calling.

14:48.192 --> 14:50.059
Be the man you are, Malcolm.

14:50.061 --> 14:51.961
End the suffering.

14:51.963 --> 14:54.697
- No more guilt.
- [Creature] Join the poets.

14:56.066 --> 14:59.502
The great explorers
of the past.

14:59.504 --> 15:01.404
Be with me.

15:01.406 --> 15:02.505
Please, Father.

15:03.606 --> 15:05.807
- Father.
- [Mina] <i>Join us, Father.</i>

15:06.910 --> 15:09.145
We need you.

15:09.147 --> 15:12.381
There will never be
peace for you otherwise.

15:12.383 --> 15:13.582
[Gladys] <i>Take my hand again.</i>

15:16.619 --> 15:18.053
Be at peace.

15:35.071 --> 15:36.471
[Vanessa dummy]
I will give you

15:36.473 --> 15:39.340
an eternity of peace
with the man you love.

15:39.342 --> 15:42.477
And at the moment
of your death, your family

15:42.479 --> 15:45.413
will gather around you
and hold your hand.

15:47.083 --> 15:50.150
- And then?
- No more suffering.

15:50.152 --> 15:53.253
No more
anguished nights of terror.

15:53.255 --> 15:57.058
Only the peace of being
who you were meant to be.

15:57.060 --> 15:59.994
At my side,
cherished bride.

15:59.996 --> 16:01.462
Your body will die,

16:01.464 --> 16:04.331
but your spirit
will be everlasting.

16:04.333 --> 16:05.632
Say yes.

16:06.901 --> 16:08.635
And my friends?

16:08.637 --> 16:11.538
Released. Left to live freely.

16:13.074 --> 16:14.874
And my God?

16:14.876 --> 16:16.977
A better God at your side.

16:18.580 --> 16:20.013
And me?

16:20.015 --> 16:21.681
You will be who you are.

16:22.783 --> 16:24.784
End the torment, Vanessa.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.587
Kiss me.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.437
You offer me a normal life...

16:45.606 --> 16:47.706
why do you think
I want that anymore?

16:50.877 --> 16:52.878
I know what I am.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.580
Do you?

16:58.618 --> 17:00.552
[Vanessa growling softly]

17:08.928 --> 17:11.029
[speaking demonic language]

17:28.613 --> 17:29.814
[rumbling]

17:32.685 --> 17:34.385
[dolls crashing]

17:55.674 --> 17:56.707
[screaming]

18:01.079 --> 18:02.345
[Vanessa dummy screaming]

18:29.273 --> 18:30.473
[panting]

18:35.178 --> 18:36.378
Beloved...

18:37.480 --> 18:39.281
know your master.

18:45.722 --> 18:46.922
[whimpering]

18:46.924 --> 18:47.957
No.

18:50.693 --> 18:51.960
No.

18:53.663 --> 18:54.829
[crying] No.

18:58.234 --> 18:59.568
No!

19:06.842 --> 19:07.976
[yelling]

19:09.078 --> 19:10.278
[Ethan growling]

19:28.430 --> 19:29.997
[growling softly]

19:31.166 --> 19:32.600
[panting]

20:04.965 --> 20:06.533
[breathing heavily]

20:28.155 --> 20:29.254
[Lyle choking]

20:35.428 --> 20:36.695
[gunshot]

20:40.266 --> 20:42.234
[breathing deeply]

20:42.236 --> 20:44.770
Never underestimate
the power of a queen

20:44.772 --> 20:47.005
with lovely hair, my dear.

20:49.608 --> 20:50.909
[panting]

21:07.192 --> 21:10.094
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Doctor?

21:10.096 --> 21:11.161
Mmm.

21:17.469 --> 21:18.936
The others are here.
I don't know where.

21:18.938 --> 21:20.437
- Vanessa?
- Yes.

21:28.113 --> 21:29.479
[shrieking]

21:40.725 --> 21:41.725
Come on.

23:31.665 --> 23:33.033
Mr. Chandler?

23:34.368 --> 23:35.701
He's safe.

23:39.106 --> 23:40.440
Mrs. Poole?

23:43.244 --> 23:44.511
Dead.

23:46.514 --> 23:47.980
It's done.

23:49.115 --> 23:50.550
[Sir Malcolm sighs]

24:31.423 --> 24:33.491
My dear Mr. Clare.

24:33.493 --> 24:36.794
Mrs. Putney's prepared you
some food.

24:36.796 --> 24:38.028
Though she's a bit
parsimonious

24:38.030 --> 24:39.197
when it comes to the victuals.

24:39.199 --> 24:41.665
- Husband!
- You know it's true.

24:42.968 --> 24:45.203
Heavy on the spices,
light on the joint,

24:45.205 --> 24:46.204
as they say.

24:50.542 --> 24:52.143
You haven't tried
screaming yet?

24:53.878 --> 24:55.980
I was not made to scream.

24:55.982 --> 24:57.247
[Putney] Some scream,

24:57.249 --> 24:59.182
some cause
others to scream, eh?

25:00.284 --> 25:02.486
Lord preserve us
from that face.

25:05.690 --> 25:07.725
Yes, that's right...

25:10.628 --> 25:13.696
sharpened up
the wardrobe, did I.

25:13.698 --> 25:15.932
Twenty shillings this cost me.

25:17.201 --> 25:20.170
Walked right into Harrods
like I owned the place,

25:20.172 --> 25:22.405
like a bleeding potentate.

25:22.407 --> 25:24.508
"My good man,"
says I to himself,

25:24.510 --> 25:26.408
"I'm in the mood
for a fresh bit of apparel

25:26.410 --> 25:28.177
"in which to bedeck myself.

25:29.279 --> 25:31.080
"Silk, if you please."

25:32.182 --> 25:33.315
[chuckles]

25:36.286 --> 25:38.587
What a feeling that was.

25:40.958 --> 25:42.658
What do you want?

25:47.864 --> 25:50.533
I've a proposition
I'd like you to consider.

25:51.734 --> 25:53.636
We have a future
ahead of us now,

25:53.638 --> 25:54.870
do the Putneys.

25:55.972 --> 25:58.607
As ballyhoos go,
my crime scenes

25:58.609 --> 26:00.642
were an ace success.

26:00.644 --> 26:03.011
And my freak show
will beggar that.

26:03.013 --> 26:07.248
Queues stretching from here
to Hackney, we'll have...

26:07.250 --> 26:09.017
once we get
a few more of you in.

26:09.019 --> 26:13.055
Why, right now
I've a line on a limbless boy

26:13.057 --> 26:15.523
who sits in an apple crate,

26:15.525 --> 26:17.825
and some malformed doxie

26:17.827 --> 26:19.060
we could claim as

26:19.062 --> 26:22.297
"sister to the late
and lamented Mr. Merrick,

26:22.299 --> 26:23.964
"the Elephant Man."

26:26.001 --> 26:27.502
And?

26:27.504 --> 26:29.036
[Putney] And you've a choice.

26:29.038 --> 26:30.538
You can share
in the success...

26:31.640 --> 26:33.273
or you can suffer.

26:35.177 --> 26:36.811
Join us, Mr. Clare.

26:38.379 --> 26:40.280
Join the great enterprise.

26:48.256 --> 26:49.756
That got his attention.

26:49.758 --> 26:51.991
Money has a way of doing that.

26:53.328 --> 26:55.862
Look here,
I don't think Harry Public

26:55.864 --> 26:57.664
enjoys seeing
miserable freaks,

26:57.666 --> 27:00.467
I think he likes to
look at jolly freaks,

27:00.469 --> 27:01.768
doing the odd trick.

27:01.770 --> 27:03.337
Odd trick, mmm.

27:04.572 --> 27:06.305
You play along,

27:06.307 --> 27:08.307
we'll give you a share
of the take.

27:09.610 --> 27:13.179
Think how nice a few shillings
will sound in your pocket.

27:18.018 --> 27:19.418
Go on.

27:19.420 --> 27:22.955
Now, we'll have to
leave you caged to start...

27:22.957 --> 27:24.223
you understand.

27:25.325 --> 27:27.293
- Yes.
- Could get you a blanket.

27:27.295 --> 27:29.061
Yeah, we could give you
a blanket.

27:30.163 --> 27:32.765
And a candle for the reading
if you like.

27:32.767 --> 27:34.199
More books.

27:34.201 --> 27:35.868
A library.

27:37.837 --> 27:40.873
And if you prove your fidelity
to the great enterprise,

27:40.875 --> 27:42.875
we'll speak about
letting you out on occasion.

27:49.548 --> 27:50.916
Until then?

27:54.787 --> 27:56.187
You do your job.

27:57.456 --> 27:59.691
You let the punters
take a good gander

27:59.693 --> 28:01.626
and you give 'em
a proper fright.

28:01.628 --> 28:02.727
A trick or two.

28:02.729 --> 28:04.763
[Putney] You welcome
the new arrivals,

28:04.765 --> 28:05.797
tell 'em what's what.

28:06.899 --> 28:09.534
Ease their transition
into servitude.

28:10.636 --> 28:11.735
[Putney chuckles]

28:12.838 --> 28:16.607
A father
to all the other freaks,

28:16.609 --> 28:17.975
if you will.

28:17.977 --> 28:19.543
King of the Freaks.

28:21.613 --> 28:22.880
[Mr. Clare grunts]

28:22.882 --> 28:23.981
[whimpering]

28:23.983 --> 28:25.016
[neck snaps]

28:26.919 --> 28:27.951
[grunting]

28:39.698 --> 28:40.864
[Lavinia] Father,

28:40.866 --> 28:42.599
are you down here?

28:47.538 --> 28:49.605
[breathing heavily]

28:49.607 --> 28:51.741
Are you sleeping, Mr. Clare?

28:58.115 --> 29:01.050
You're probably handsome
in your dreams.

29:01.052 --> 29:03.419
I'll bet you wish
you could sleep every second.

29:04.921 --> 29:08.924
No such luck,
you grotesque animal.

29:15.265 --> 29:16.198
Father?

29:17.300 --> 29:18.633
Mother?

29:20.436 --> 29:21.636
Father?

29:29.078 --> 29:30.812
[Lavinia screaming]

29:34.183 --> 29:37.418
[Hecate]
<i>â™ª My breast is cold as clay</i>

29:37.420 --> 29:40.889
<i>â™ª My breath is earthly strong</i>

29:40.891 --> 29:45.360
<i>â™ª And if you kiss
my cold clay lips</i>

29:45.362 --> 29:48.829
<i>â™ª Your days,
they won't be long</i>

29:48.831 --> 29:52.934
<i>â™ª How oft on yonder grave,
sweetheart</i>

29:52.936 --> 29:56.336
<i>â™ª Where we were wont to walk</i>

29:56.338 --> 30:00.340
<i>â™ª The fairest flower
that e'er I saw</i>

30:00.342 --> 30:03.811
<i>â™ª Has withered to a stalk</i>

30:03.813 --> 30:07.314
<i>â™ª When will we
meet again, sweetheart?</i>

30:08.417 --> 30:11.285
<i>â™ª When will we meet again?</i>

30:13.854 --> 30:18.191
<i>â™ª When the autumn leaves
that fall from the trees</i>

30:20.828 --> 30:24.697
<i>â™ª Are green
and spring up again â™ª</i>

31:07.039 --> 31:09.107
You didn't have to
accompany me.

31:10.276 --> 31:12.611
It's good to have a friend
on such a night.

31:12.613 --> 31:14.012
I'll be fine.

31:16.382 --> 31:18.283
I needed the friend, Doctor.

31:23.822 --> 31:27.359
I have not seen such things
or done such things.

31:29.996 --> 31:31.229
And with such relish.

31:32.331 --> 31:33.764
God help me.

31:35.433 --> 31:37.334
You will have a mind to my...

31:37.336 --> 31:38.268
particular secret, yes?

31:39.371 --> 31:40.838
I'm sorry?

31:40.840 --> 31:43.207
That tribe
into which I was born.

31:44.676 --> 31:46.276
Yes, of course.

31:48.847 --> 31:50.381
- Good night, Mr. Lyle.
- Good night.

31:50.383 --> 31:52.216
Do take care of yourself.

31:52.218 --> 31:55.486
And know that
beneath these silken tresses

31:55.488 --> 31:57.621
I have a good ear
for listening...

31:58.823 --> 32:00.590
should you need one.

32:07.932 --> 32:09.900
- [driver shouts]
- [horses neighing]

32:17.141 --> 32:18.708
[baby crying]

32:50.173 --> 32:51.273
Lily.

32:53.409 --> 32:54.509
Lily.

32:58.814 --> 33:00.382
[panting]

33:42.257 --> 33:43.924
<i>â™ª</i>

34:03.577 --> 34:05.278
[music stops]

34:05.280 --> 34:07.847
Victor! How lovely to see you!

34:07.849 --> 34:09.649
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Stop it!

34:11.051 --> 34:14.420
Cousin, how you look.
Are you quite all right?

34:14.422 --> 34:15.487
Would you like to sit down?

34:15.489 --> 34:17.456
Spare me your gallantry.

34:18.792 --> 34:20.760
Lily, you must come home.

34:22.262 --> 34:23.529
I am home, darling.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.799
Really, Doctor,

34:26.801 --> 34:29.601
Lily's not a girl for tenement
garrets, now, is she?

34:29.603 --> 34:32.071
- On the South Bank, no less.
- [Lily] Mmm.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.040
- [Lily laughs]
- [Dorian] Oh!

34:35.042 --> 34:36.574
Well, there's gallantry.

34:36.577 --> 34:37.909
Who did you have in mind
to shoot?

34:37.911 --> 34:39.077
Stop it!

34:42.315 --> 34:43.815
Please come back, Lily.

34:44.984 --> 34:46.284
I love you.

34:46.286 --> 34:49.588
We can make it our home again,
I promise.

34:49.590 --> 34:52.322
Our bed in the storm,
you mean?

34:53.693 --> 34:55.193
Oh...

34:55.195 --> 34:57.094
You're too sweet.

34:57.097 --> 34:59.931
That night I took
your awkward virginity,

34:59.933 --> 35:01.599
all thumbs he was.

35:01.601 --> 35:03.868
How trembling and terrified.

35:03.870 --> 35:05.103
Stop it.

35:05.105 --> 35:06.805
Like a grubby little boy

35:06.807 --> 35:09.240
cramming his hand
into the sweet jar.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.678
[exhales sharply]

35:13.680 --> 35:14.579
[gasps]

35:15.681 --> 35:17.348
Please, Creator...

35:18.584 --> 35:20.284
you made me too well for that.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.254
Oh, yes, I know.

35:25.356 --> 35:26.824
Always have.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.360
You were so...

35:31.462 --> 35:33.731
sublimely malleable.

35:43.608 --> 35:45.108
[Lily giggles]

35:52.950 --> 35:55.051
You'll have to do
better than that, sport.

35:57.354 --> 35:59.355
Shall we kill him?

35:59.357 --> 36:00.857
[Dorian]
They're made for killing.

36:00.859 --> 36:01.924
[Lily] Mmm.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.260
[Dorian] I've experienced

36:04.262 --> 36:07.096
so many sensations
over the years...

36:07.098 --> 36:09.365
but never one
precisely like this.

36:11.235 --> 36:12.568
Complete supremacy.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.036
Cruelty even.

36:15.038 --> 36:16.705
Ascendancy.

36:16.707 --> 36:18.039
Conquest.

36:19.842 --> 36:20.876
And him?

36:23.713 --> 36:25.581
Shall we murder him right now?

36:26.683 --> 36:28.417
Entirely up to you, darling.

36:30.286 --> 36:31.987
[Lily] No.

36:31.989 --> 36:34.222
He might still prove
useful to us.

36:35.424 --> 36:36.825
Let him live.

36:38.261 --> 36:40.461
Let him live
with what he has created...

36:41.563 --> 36:42.931
a master race.

36:44.033 --> 36:47.134
A race of immortals,
meant to command.

36:48.704 --> 36:52.640
- Soon, he will kneel to us.
- [Dorian] They all will.

36:52.642 --> 36:54.709
When our day has come...

36:55.977 --> 36:58.078
you will know terror.

37:01.417 --> 37:04.051
Until then, little man...

37:04.053 --> 37:08.022
live with the knowledge
of what you have spawned.

37:08.024 --> 37:09.389
And suffer.

37:28.609 --> 37:30.276
<i>â™ª</i>

37:39.753 --> 37:40.920
[Lily] Mmm.

38:02.776 --> 38:03.942
[bell tolling]

38:09.715 --> 38:12.751
[Sir Malcolm]
I'll bring him home to Africa.

38:12.753 --> 38:15.320
From whence I should
never have brought him.

38:16.822 --> 38:19.057
Let him lie
in his native earth.

38:22.028 --> 38:23.595
You'll be all right?

38:28.701 --> 38:29.934
Of course.

38:31.937 --> 38:33.971
Mr. Chandler will be here.

38:35.941 --> 38:37.742
Don't worry about me.

38:41.179 --> 38:43.447
Sembene was a proper man.

38:45.550 --> 38:47.184
I've not known many.

39:54.049 --> 39:55.749
You know what I am.

39:57.552 --> 39:58.786
Yes.

40:00.255 --> 40:01.889
And here I stand.

40:10.699 --> 40:13.200
Sir Malcolm
is going to Africa.

40:13.202 --> 40:15.102
This dreadful house
will soon be empty.

40:15.104 --> 40:17.905
We can lock the doors
and walk away forever.

40:21.977 --> 40:24.177
There's no walking away
from what I am.

40:25.279 --> 40:26.914
What we both are.

40:35.223 --> 40:38.025
I have run from the darkness
for so long...

40:39.127 --> 40:41.928
only to find myself
in a place darker still.

40:46.099 --> 40:47.700
Walk with me.

40:50.103 --> 40:52.939
You recall the night
I came to your room?

40:52.941 --> 40:54.707
I was so frightened.

40:54.709 --> 40:56.275
You were kind,

40:56.277 --> 40:58.477
and in the morning
I was not so afraid.

40:59.713 --> 41:01.480
Stay with me tonight.

41:19.999 --> 41:21.567
[Ethan] And tomorrow?

41:23.970 --> 41:26.337
I promise you,
we will be less afraid.

41:33.379 --> 41:34.979
I need to think.

41:56.768 --> 41:58.135
Forgive me.

42:01.339 --> 42:02.439
I do.

42:13.618 --> 42:14.884
[door opens]

42:18.323 --> 42:20.090
[men shouting indistinctly]

43:08.004 --> 43:11.506
- Hold on there!
- We tried to stop him, sir.

43:13.643 --> 43:14.876
Leave us.

43:16.679 --> 43:17.945
Go on now.

43:21.950 --> 43:23.285
Shut the door.

43:27.823 --> 43:29.023
[door closes]

43:34.462 --> 43:35.830
[Ethan] I did it.

43:37.900 --> 43:39.333
The Mariner's Inn.

43:40.535 --> 43:42.036
All of them.

43:44.073 --> 43:45.306
You'll confess?

43:45.308 --> 43:46.373
Yes.

43:58.786 --> 43:59.986
[sighs]

44:03.490 --> 44:05.025
Sit down, Mr. Talbot.

44:15.669 --> 44:17.403
May I ask one thing?

44:18.739 --> 44:20.540
You may ask anything.

44:21.642 --> 44:23.142
I'll confess to the lot.

44:24.245 --> 44:25.745
Just make it quick.

44:28.315 --> 44:30.916
- The hanging, you mean?
- Yes.

44:32.553 --> 44:34.186
There's not
going to be a hanging.

44:35.288 --> 44:37.322
At least not here.

44:40.460 --> 44:42.427
I've had this for weeks...

44:44.464 --> 44:45.631
but I wanted the satisfaction

44:45.633 --> 44:48.600
of writing finis
to this affair in my own way,

44:48.602 --> 44:50.269
- as I told you I would.
- [sighs]

44:51.371 --> 44:52.437
What is that?

44:53.539 --> 44:54.806
It's an extradition order.

44:58.311 --> 45:00.312
You're going home, Ethan.

45:18.898 --> 45:19.964
[Frankenstein groaning]

45:25.003 --> 45:26.203
[exhales deeply]

45:54.165 --> 45:55.565
[sniffling]

46:06.944 --> 46:08.211
Mmm.

46:23.861 --> 46:25.361
[train rumbling]

46:42.311 --> 46:43.579
Mr. Clare.

46:44.681 --> 46:46.014
[Mr. Clare] Miss Ives.

46:49.151 --> 46:50.785
Why are you here?

46:53.389 --> 46:55.123
I needed a friend.

47:01.597 --> 47:03.064
Won't you sit?

47:08.404 --> 47:10.070
[indistinct whisperings]

47:13.675 --> 47:15.242
Are you leaving?

47:18.514 --> 47:19.580
Yes.

47:20.715 --> 47:21.982
For long?

47:25.186 --> 47:26.420
Forever.

47:28.390 --> 47:29.456
Where will you go?

47:30.558 --> 47:31.926
Where I belong.

47:33.795 --> 47:35.462
Away from mankind.

47:38.098 --> 47:40.333
This dream I had... this...

47:42.102 --> 47:46.573
this long dream of kinship
with those unlike me...

47:50.478 --> 47:51.845
it is gone.

47:54.514 --> 47:55.915
Yes.

47:55.917 --> 47:58.851
When you have seen that
of which you are capable...

48:01.521 --> 48:04.057
when you have stood in blood
long enough...

48:06.093 --> 48:09.962
what is there left but to wade
to a desolate shore,

48:09.964 --> 48:11.764
away from all others?

48:13.099 --> 48:14.199
Yes.

48:17.471 --> 48:18.771
And you?

48:21.842 --> 48:23.509
Where is your shore?

48:29.682 --> 48:31.716
There is no place far enough.

48:34.687 --> 48:37.522
I've lost the immortal part
of myself, you see.

48:39.158 --> 48:41.059
No.

48:41.061 --> 48:42.827
I've thrown it away.

48:49.835 --> 48:52.971
No matter how far you have
walked from God...

48:54.940 --> 48:56.975
he is still waiting ahead.

48:58.377 --> 49:00.077
You don't believe in God.

49:01.846 --> 49:03.214
But you do.

49:07.452 --> 49:09.186
That dream is gone.

49:23.834 --> 49:25.367
Come with me?

49:29.239 --> 49:30.973
Our desolate shore?

49:36.279 --> 49:37.680
Mr. Clare...

49:44.387 --> 49:46.188
there is around me...

49:47.490 --> 49:49.758
a shroud
that brings only pain.

49:52.495 --> 49:55.063
I won't allow you to suffer.
Not you.

50:14.783 --> 50:17.085
I think you are
the most human man...

50:18.187 --> 50:19.520
I have ever known.

50:37.505 --> 50:38.806
[sobbing quietly]

51:13.006 --> 51:14.006
[sighs]

52:19.970 --> 52:21.705
[Ethan] <i>Dear Vanessa...</i>

52:24.975 --> 52:28.011
<i>your many kindnesses
I will always carry with me.</i>

52:29.279 --> 52:31.247
<i>Such generosity...</i>

52:31.249 --> 52:33.683
<i>has not been
a part of my life,</i>

52:33.685 --> 52:38.121
<i>and I thank you for your
affection and understanding.</i>

53:00.610 --> 53:03.278
<i>In my most frightened
and lonely moments...</i>

53:04.380 --> 53:05.914
<i>you were there.</i>

53:10.220 --> 53:12.554
<i>And such light
you brought to me.</i>

53:17.326 --> 53:20.161
<i>But I am made for the dark.
This we both know.</i>

53:21.797 --> 53:23.431
<i>I am fit for only one place</i>

53:23.433 --> 53:25.933
<i>and should have been there
long ago.</i>

53:27.703 --> 53:31.305
<i>Deep in the cold clay
on a forgotten hill.</i>

53:48.523 --> 53:51.292
<i>Your road may be difficult.</i>

53:53.928 --> 53:55.663
<i>But mine is doomed.</i>

54:01.936 --> 54:03.804
<i>So we walk alone.</i>

54:07.909 --> 54:10.376
<i>Written with love...</i>

54:13.214 --> 54:14.347
<i>Ethan.</i>

55:26.217 --> 55:27.885
So we walk alone.
