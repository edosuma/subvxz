BLUE SPRINGS, KENTUCKY

01:11.089 --> 01:13.657
Intel confirms three targets.

01:13.759 --> 01:15.325
Repeat this is a capture mission.

01:15.427 --> 01:18.128
Get the Guanos and go, copy that.

01:18.230 --> 01:19.596
Time to nut up, corn flake.

02:09.181 --> 02:10.614
All clear.

02:11.950 --> 02:13.817
Maintain communication
and clear your sector,

02:13.919 --> 02:15.219
return to position.

02:15.321 --> 02:16.986
Move it out.

02:18.657 --> 02:20.324
Watch yourself.

03:18.417 --> 03:19.750
I think I saw something.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.050
I'm going down to two.

03:21.153 --> 03:22.386
No, we go together.

03:22.488 --> 03:24.688
We wait, we could lose them.

03:24.790 --> 03:26.290
I'm going in.

03:26.392 --> 03:29.359
Regan, return to your
team at checkpoint alpha.

03:29.461 --> 03:32.128
Regan, give me your position.

03:32.230 --> 03:33.263
She's not responding.

03:33.365 --> 03:35.031
Always a team player.

03:35.133 --> 03:37.100
I'm going down to get her.

03:37.202 --> 03:38.134
Meet me back at alpha.

03:40.372 --> 03:43.072
Page? Page, are you there?

04:51.543 --> 04:54.043
Regan, give me your position.

05:00.886 --> 05:02.786
Regan, give us your position.

05:02.888 --> 05:04.988
We got our dicks flapping
in the wind up here.

05:26.378 --> 05:28.144
We heard shots fired.

05:28.246 --> 05:29.613
Page, what's your position?

05:32.317 --> 05:33.950
Briggs, we're under attack.

05:34.052 --> 05:34.918
I'm going after Regan.

05:35.020 --> 05:37.220
Page, say again. Page!

05:52.538 --> 05:54.037
Regan!

05:57.676 --> 05:59.910
Page! No!

06:17.796 --> 06:18.762
Page.

06:23.839 --> 06:38.881
Hunters 1x01 - The Beginning & the End

06:39.046 --> 06:43.176
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

06:55.433 --> 06:57.701
I hear something.

06:57.803 --> 06:59.268
Are you sure?

06:59.371 --> 07:02.205
There's someone downstairs.

07:02.307 --> 07:04.608
Maybe it's your hearing aid acting up.

07:04.710 --> 07:06.009
I'm sure.

07:08.547 --> 07:10.914
All right, all right, I got it.

07:11.016 --> 07:12.782
- Go check on Emme.
- Okay.

07:48.486 --> 07:50.620
Hey Ab, did you leave the window open?

07:50.722 --> 07:53.389
No, why?

07:53.491 --> 07:55.759
We got ourselves an intruder.

07:55.861 --> 07:57.393
Hey, hey...

07:57.495 --> 07:58.161
Come on, let's go.

07:58.263 --> 07:59.195
Wait, what are you doing?

07:59.297 --> 08:00.864
Putting him back where he belongs.

08:00.966 --> 08:02.899
What? No.

08:03.001 --> 08:05.669
He's so young and he's all alone.

08:05.771 --> 08:08.905
Abs, he'll be fine.

08:09.007 --> 08:10.740
You got enough on your plate.

08:10.842 --> 08:12.976
You can't keep every stray we find.

08:17.883 --> 08:20.550
Emme?

08:20.652 --> 08:22.351
Emme!

08:22.454 --> 08:24.153
How could you say that in front of her?

08:24.255 --> 08:25.088
I didn't mean her.

08:25.190 --> 08:27.691
You need to apologize to her... now.

08:28.660 --> 08:30.193
Of course.

08:30.295 --> 08:33.029
I'll meet you back upstairs.

08:33.131 --> 08:34.563
Okay.

08:34.666 --> 08:36.332
We're not keeping the cat.

08:39.370 --> 08:40.703
Emme...

09:05.163 --> 09:06.129
I'm sorry about what I said.

09:06.231 --> 09:08.564
I wasn't talking about you, I promise.

09:13.105 --> 09:15.138
Come on, Emme, say something.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.539
Shut the door, please.

09:17.575 --> 09:19.242
Emme...

09:21.113 --> 09:25.048
Okay.

09:25.150 --> 09:27.751
Good night.

09:34.159 --> 09:35.125
Preliminary exam confirms

09:35.226 --> 09:37.460
these bodies match those
previously found.

09:37.562 --> 09:38.862
I need full forensics.

09:38.964 --> 09:41.364
The more we know about how
our team took them out,

09:41.466 --> 09:42.966
the safer we'll be on our next op.

09:43.068 --> 09:44.034
And Agent Page, sir?

09:44.136 --> 09:46.169
We'll handle his autopsy internally.

09:46.271 --> 09:47.537
I'll notify his loved ones,

09:47.639 --> 09:50.073
cover why we need a closed casket.

10:31.817 --> 10:34.050
In case you're in any
doubt as to my opinion,

10:34.152 --> 10:35.985
the loss of Page is unacceptable.

10:36.922 --> 10:38.421
Full disclosure...

10:38.523 --> 10:41.758
Page's death was completely avoidable.

10:41.860 --> 10:44.761
- Was our intel bad?
- No.

10:44.863 --> 10:45.895
She was.

10:48.100 --> 10:49.599
It's a mother lode of information.

10:50.836 --> 10:53.838
Coahuila was a calcium carbonate plant
before they shut it down.

10:53.839 --> 10:55.171
Drug traffickers use that to cut heroin.

10:55.273 --> 10:56.472
It's actually limestone, sir.

10:56.574 --> 10:57.841
No signs of any drugs, sir,

10:57.943 --> 10:59.642
but the place was creepy as shit.

10:59.745 --> 11:01.344
We found a cage full of rabbits.

11:01.446 --> 11:03.046
And whatever the hell that thing is.

11:05.717 --> 11:07.083
What we do know is this...

11:07.185 --> 11:08.351
Coahuila cell was part of

11:08.453 --> 11:10.220
a larger terrorist network.

11:10.321 --> 11:11.855
The Hunter threat is imminent.

11:11.957 --> 11:14.224
We need to find a link
to their leadership.

11:14.325 --> 11:16.559
Stop the Hunters before
they strike again.

11:16.661 --> 11:18.694
After a highly successful operation,

11:18.797 --> 11:20.063
that resulted in the shutting down of

11:20.165 --> 11:22.841
the largest heroin producing
ring in the state,

11:22.842 --> 11:25.301
the FBI now finds itself the
subject of investigation.

11:25.403 --> 11:27.203
The "Washington Post" is reporting that

11:27.305 --> 11:30.039
an internal inquiry was
launched today prompted

11:30.142 --> 11:31.274
by a number of complaints about

11:31.376 --> 11:33.943
a highly decorated key officer involved

11:34.045 --> 11:35.645
in that heroin task force.

11:35.747 --> 11:38.014
In other news, the Royals
won over the Angels

11:38.116 --> 11:40.784
and now have a 1-0 lead
in the three game series.

11:40.886 --> 11:42.355
FBI REGIONAL OFFICE

11:42.356 --> 11:45.055
Agent Carroll, this is an official
inquiry and you are on record.

11:45.056 --> 11:46.790
How's the counseling going?

11:46.892 --> 11:48.958
It's not mandatory.

11:49.060 --> 11:50.927
No medication for your PTSD?

11:52.330 --> 11:54.363
Doing anything at all to help yourself?

11:54.465 --> 11:56.800
Walking along the beach at sunset.

11:56.902 --> 11:59.235
What about Dauson's daughter?

11:59.337 --> 12:01.570
Your partner dies, you take in his kid.

12:02.507 --> 12:03.807
Emme's got nothing to do with this.

12:03.909 --> 12:05.208
She's got issues of her own.

12:05.310 --> 12:06.242
That's gotta be a lot of stress.

12:06.344 --> 12:09.645
I said... it's got
nothing to do with Emme.

12:12.250 --> 12:13.416
Sir.

12:14.519 --> 12:16.252
My favorite piece.

12:16.354 --> 12:19.055
We'll start on it next week.

12:19.157 --> 12:21.357
Thanks, Abby.

12:33.972 --> 12:36.072
Three cell phones seized in the raid.

12:36.174 --> 12:38.541
Each received the same photo
an hour before the raid.

12:38.643 --> 12:39.309
Encryption?

12:39.410 --> 12:42.212
Yeah, top notch. RSA 4096.

12:42.314 --> 12:43.612
I ran it through the NSA's quantum.

12:43.715 --> 12:46.983
They just upgraded to eight
kilocubics, greedy bastards.

12:47.085 --> 12:48.284
I don't know what that means.

12:48.386 --> 12:50.053
It means I got this...

12:50.155 --> 12:54.457
Abby Carroll, 32. Piano teacher.

12:57.548 --> 12:59.165
FROM: FLYNN
KEPT MY COOL. ALL YOU. XD

13:03.034 --> 13:05.235
This is Agent Carroll, leave a message.

13:05.337 --> 13:06.336
Babe, it's me.

13:06.437 --> 13:08.238
Don't forget the wine.

13:08.340 --> 13:11.074
And don't be late. 8:30.

13:14.379 --> 13:17.113
It's okay, I'm right here.

13:20.585 --> 13:23.019
Hello? Who's there?

13:26.424 --> 13:30.260
They say that music is the
strangest form of magic.

13:30.362 --> 13:31.928
You know who said that?

13:32.030 --> 13:34.663
Marilyn Manson.

13:37.435 --> 13:39.869
I saw him at the Bowery
in New York last summer.

13:39.971 --> 13:41.504
Say what you will about the guy's music,

13:41.606 --> 13:42.906
he's one hell of a showman.

13:46.945 --> 13:49.045
Wanna hear my magic, Abby?

13:49.147 --> 13:50.914
Please, don't hurt me.

13:51.016 --> 13:53.682
On the contrary, I am here to help you.

13:57.588 --> 13:59.855
What about these?

13:59.958 --> 14:02.058
What about these sonic crutches?

14:04.129 --> 14:06.329
We don't need 'em, do we, Abby?

14:11.069 --> 14:13.903
We'll just...

14:14.005 --> 14:17.206
- turn it up.
- No!

14:17.309 --> 14:19.275
No!

14:42.267 --> 14:45.234
Please, no.

14:50.794 --> 14:53.329
Hey, babe, sorry I'm late.

14:53.798 --> 14:55.030
Traffic was crazy.

14:55.133 --> 14:57.333
I got the wine... Hey, where's Abby?

14:57.679 --> 14:58.945
She's not here.

14:59.047 --> 15:01.280
- What?
- She's not upstairs.

15:02.283 --> 15:03.783
That's weird.

15:03.885 --> 15:05.017
Her car's in the driveway.

15:05.119 --> 15:06.386
We got that potluck.

15:37.018 --> 15:39.619
I need to report a missing person.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.488
Yeah, it's been 48 hours.

15:44.359 --> 15:46.192
I appreciate that.

15:48.663 --> 15:51.431
I'm sure she will too.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.867
Thanks.

15:53.968 --> 15:57.637
I... saved you some anchovy.

16:04.112 --> 16:06.513
Are you okay?

16:07.516 --> 16:09.348
Yeah, not even close.

16:14.989 --> 16:16.456
We're gonna find her.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.391
I need to practice.

16:19.461 --> 16:21.227
Abby gave me a new piece of music.

16:21.329 --> 16:23.996
I want it to be good
when she comes home.

16:33.341 --> 16:36.142
Externally, the subject
presents as a human male,

16:36.244 --> 16:38.244
approximately 30 years of age.

16:38.346 --> 16:40.847
But as with previous Hunter specimens,

16:40.949 --> 16:42.982
the similarity to humans ends here.

16:43.084 --> 16:44.818
As observed in previous subjects,

16:44.920 --> 16:46.686
there is an outer layer
of human integumentary

16:46.788 --> 16:49.388
and vascular system,
including blood and skin.

16:51.993 --> 16:55.995
The ribcage is cross-braced,
with two resident chambers

16:56.097 --> 16:58.264
below the ribs in place of lungs.

17:07.576 --> 17:09.843
The heart is held in place by tendons

17:09.944 --> 17:11.611
thicker than those found in humans,

17:11.713 --> 17:13.646
possibly the result of evolution

17:13.748 --> 17:16.048
in a stronger gravitational environment.

17:17.050 --> 17:18.518
My God.

17:23.156 --> 17:25.290
This subject sustained severe injury

17:25.393 --> 17:26.826
from a gunshot to the face.

17:26.928 --> 17:28.828
- But it didn't kill him?
- No.

17:28.930 --> 17:33.466
A sonic blast to the cranial
region was the cause of death.

17:33.568 --> 17:35.434
We're lucky we only lost one man.

17:42.176 --> 17:44.744
Move your feet, come on, move your feet!

17:45.680 --> 17:47.413
Keep your hands high.

17:49.117 --> 17:50.550
Higher, that's good.

17:50.652 --> 17:51.651
That's it, that's it.

18:42.871 --> 18:44.804
Flynn? I'm home.

18:44.906 --> 18:46.138
Abby?

18:47.742 --> 18:49.375
Where've you been?

18:49.477 --> 18:51.578
I've been worried sick.

19:32.220 --> 19:33.886
Hey.

19:33.989 --> 19:36.555
Emme!

19:38.960 --> 19:40.392
Emme?

19:46.167 --> 19:48.267
There you are.

19:48.369 --> 19:50.069
You scared the hell out of me.

19:50.171 --> 19:51.904
So you do care.

19:52.007 --> 19:54.173
I thought you only wanted
me for my Ritalin.

20:06.054 --> 20:08.955
A policeman came to the house today.

20:09.057 --> 20:12.324
And he asked me a lot of
questions about you and Abby.

20:12.426 --> 20:13.292
Like what?

20:13.394 --> 20:15.028
Like, if you guys fight a lot.

20:15.130 --> 20:18.698
If you've ever hurt
her, things like that.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.368
It was like he thought you
did something to Abby.

20:22.470 --> 20:24.470
What do you think?

20:24.572 --> 20:26.272
I think he was an asshole.

20:30.211 --> 20:32.045
It's true.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.913
You would never hurt Abby.

20:35.349 --> 20:38.985
I mean, if you wanted someone
gone, it would be me.

20:42.523 --> 20:44.590
I need to ask you something.

20:44.693 --> 20:46.192
And you need to tell me the truth.

20:47.796 --> 20:49.095
Is there anything that she was doing

20:49.197 --> 20:51.263
that I didn't know about?

20:51.365 --> 20:53.232
Anything?

21:00.608 --> 21:03.609
Last Friday, Abby was late when
she picked up me at school.

21:03.712 --> 21:05.611
She said she went to a
music store in Dundalk,

21:05.714 --> 21:08.114
but when we got in the car I saw this.

21:09.450 --> 21:11.517
That's, like, in the total
opposite direction.

21:11.619 --> 21:16.255
Arrive at 1445 Quaker
Ridge Road in 45 minutes.

21:17.454 --> 21:19.320
ETU HEADQUARTERS
N.W. WASHINGTON D.C.

21:19.909 --> 21:21.176
Abby Carroll.

21:21.177 --> 21:22.944
Reported missing less than 24 hours

21:23.046 --> 21:26.414
after her picture was sent
to the Coahuila cell.

21:26.516 --> 21:27.282
Could be a sleeper agent.

21:27.383 --> 21:28.582
Or an innocent civilian.

21:28.685 --> 21:32.553
Whoever she is, she's also
married to an FBI agent.

21:32.655 --> 21:34.322
Flynn Carroll.

21:34.424 --> 21:37.025
Did two tours of Afghanistan
before joining the Bureau.

21:37.127 --> 21:40.695
Spent some time with
JTTF, mostly narcotics.

21:40.797 --> 21:42.396
Undercover of late.

21:42.498 --> 21:43.898
He's being investigated internally

21:44.000 --> 21:46.400
for questionable behavior.

21:46.502 --> 21:47.535
A Fed.

21:47.637 --> 21:49.603
He's gonna be sticking his
nose in our business.

21:49.706 --> 21:51.806
Well, we won't let that happen, will we?

22:21.137 --> 22:24.339
We have a lead on the
Carroll surveillance.

22:24.440 --> 22:25.840
Could be another cell.

22:25.942 --> 22:27.475
But when we got in the car, I saw this.

22:27.577 --> 22:32.780
Arrive at 1445 Quaker
Ridge Road in 45 minutes.

22:32.883 --> 22:34.849
All right, pull the thread,
see where it leads.

22:34.951 --> 22:38.253
Eyes only, 1445 Quaker Ridge Road.

23:15.591 --> 23:16.457
Yeah?

23:16.559 --> 23:17.225
Mr. Carroll?

23:17.327 --> 23:19.027
This is Principal Sherman.

23:19.129 --> 23:23.597
I'm afraid Emme has had another...
incident.

23:23.699 --> 23:24.632
How bad is it?

23:24.734 --> 23:26.500
She'll be fine, but...

23:26.602 --> 23:29.503
coupled with her spectrum disorder,

23:29.605 --> 23:31.839
I'm afraid self-harming is not something

23:31.942 --> 23:34.008
that we're equipped for here.

23:34.110 --> 23:37.378
We need to look at another option.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.713
I'll be there as soon as I can.

24:08.845 --> 24:10.445
Pretty boy's going in.

24:11.747 --> 24:14.248
Jackson said eyes only.

25:48.010 --> 25:49.243
FBI. Turn around!

25:49.345 --> 25:51.045
Put your hands where I can see 'em!

25:53.616 --> 25:55.416
Turn around!

26:00.034 --> 26:01.289
Be quiet.

26:01.391 --> 26:03.824
As quiet as a church mouse.

26:05.128 --> 26:09.263
Abby... where is she?

26:09.365 --> 26:11.466
She's gone, and you'll
never see her again.

26:11.568 --> 26:14.001
You took my wife, asshole.

26:15.004 --> 26:17.705
My, my, my, such strong language.

26:27.049 --> 26:28.782
I've got him. Get in the car! Go!

26:52.342 --> 26:54.342
Who are you?

26:54.444 --> 26:55.743
Agent Briggs.

26:55.845 --> 26:56.977
We're on the same side.

26:57.079 --> 26:59.380
I'm looking for your wife.

27:00.499 --> 27:01.582
Bullshit!

27:01.684 --> 27:04.718
Don't believe me? Ask my boss.

27:04.820 --> 27:06.654
He's very keen to meet you.

27:27.517 --> 27:29.417
Agent Carroll.

27:29.519 --> 27:32.154
I'll be handling your debriefing.

27:32.256 --> 27:33.622
Okay.

27:34.892 --> 27:36.524
Who the fuck are you people?

27:36.627 --> 27:39.327
Agents Regan and Briggs work for me.

27:39.429 --> 27:40.462
My name's Truss Jackson.

27:40.564 --> 27:43.565
I'm Commander of Joint Task Force Wotan.

27:43.667 --> 27:45.433
Though, we prefer to call ourselves

27:45.535 --> 27:47.903
the Exo-Terrorism Unit...

27:48.005 --> 27:49.204
E.T.U.

27:49.306 --> 27:50.572
I worked in counterterrorism.

27:50.674 --> 27:53.541
I never heard of any...
Exo-Terrorism Unit.

27:53.644 --> 27:55.110
The E.T.U. deals with
the kinds of terrorists

27:55.212 --> 27:58.080
other agencies aren't
equipped to handle.

27:58.182 --> 27:59.748
Like the ones we believe are responsible

27:59.850 --> 28:02.017
for the disappearance of your wife.

28:02.119 --> 28:05.453
You think terrorists kidnapped my wife?

28:06.924 --> 28:09.491
She's a piano teacher.

28:11.162 --> 28:12.995
How did you find that farmhouse?

28:13.097 --> 28:15.497
By reading a fortune cookie.

28:18.202 --> 28:20.402
Did you see the men inside?

28:22.940 --> 28:24.773
Could you identify the suspects

28:24.875 --> 28:27.109
inside the farmhouse?

28:27.211 --> 28:28.510
I couldn't make 'em in a lineup,

28:28.612 --> 28:30.212
but I got a glimpse.

28:31.748 --> 28:33.015
One guy had dreads.

28:33.117 --> 28:36.351
The other two looked like burn victims.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.086
Who are they?

28:38.189 --> 28:40.455
- It's classified.
- Yeah.

28:40.557 --> 28:43.859
Tell me what they have
to do with my wife.

28:44.595 --> 28:45.961
I'm not at liberty to say.

28:46.063 --> 28:48.297
Hey.

28:48.398 --> 28:51.533
Do those bastards have my wife?

28:51.635 --> 28:53.101
Go home.

28:53.204 --> 28:54.669
Get some rest.

28:56.273 --> 28:58.740
We'll talk some more later.

29:06.217 --> 29:07.482
So?

29:32.309 --> 29:35.177
Emme, I'm sorry I couldn't pick you up.

29:35.279 --> 29:36.979
Principal Sherman brought me home.

29:37.081 --> 29:40.282
She's not as much of a bitch
as I thought she was.

29:46.257 --> 29:48.090
What happened?

29:50.560 --> 29:54.729
A girl asked why I wasn't
crying about Abby.

29:57.034 --> 29:58.500
And I don't know.

30:00.037 --> 30:01.803
So I hurt myself.

30:03.607 --> 30:05.173
There's a therapeutic boarding school...

30:05.276 --> 30:08.510
- Boarding school?
- Therapeutic boarding school.

30:08.612 --> 30:11.813
Abby and I were looking into
it after your last incident.

30:14.151 --> 30:16.518
Emme, I'm sorry.

30:16.620 --> 30:18.553
Now that Abby's gone,
you're getting rid of me

30:18.655 --> 30:20.722
just like you always wanted.

30:20.824 --> 30:21.723
That isn't true.

30:21.825 --> 30:23.792
You promised my dad.

30:23.894 --> 30:24.993
He was your partner.

30:25.095 --> 30:27.195
- You promised him. You're a liar.
- I know.

30:27.298 --> 30:28.163
- Liar! Liar!
- No.

30:28.265 --> 30:30.765
Liar! Liar! Liar!

30:30.867 --> 30:32.134
Emme, no, no, no, no, no.

30:32.236 --> 30:35.570
Hey, hey. Hey. Hey.

30:37.007 --> 30:39.975
I don't want to stay with you anyway.

30:40.077 --> 30:41.343
Emme.

30:41.445 --> 30:42.777
Let go of me!

30:42.879 --> 30:44.546
Emme.

30:51.021 --> 30:52.220
You want some help?

30:52.323 --> 30:53.521
No.

30:55.125 --> 30:57.159
Hey, Emme.

30:57.261 --> 30:58.693
Emme.

30:58.795 --> 31:02.530
Carroll is a skilled agent
and a nosy one at that.

31:02.632 --> 31:06.160
More importantly, his wife seems
to mean something to the Hunters.

31:06.870 --> 31:09.338
And then there's the
business of the scar.

31:12.943 --> 31:14.576
I understand.

31:16.847 --> 31:18.880
He is a risk.

31:20.451 --> 31:22.050
All right.

31:22.152 --> 31:24.119
I'll handle it.

32:02.393 --> 32:03.858
Agent Carroll.

32:03.960 --> 32:06.061
You find my wife?

32:08.198 --> 32:09.864
Then what is it?

32:09.966 --> 32:12.901
Your transfer to Homeland Security.

32:13.003 --> 32:15.170
Homeland Security?

32:15.272 --> 32:16.871
It's a cover.

32:16.973 --> 32:18.407
Welcome to the E.T.U.

32:22.050 --> 32:22.791
ETU HEADQUARTERS

32:22.792 --> 32:24.779
All personnel are cleared
for classified operations.

32:24.881 --> 32:28.250
Briggs here comes courtesy of
Australian Special Ops Command.

32:28.352 --> 32:29.884
With your skills and experience,

32:29.986 --> 32:31.119
you'll be an excellent replacement

32:31.221 --> 32:33.121
for an agent we just lost.

32:33.223 --> 32:35.424
That's not a great sales pitch.

32:35.526 --> 32:38.327
What I'm about to show you
is known only to this unit

32:38.328 --> 32:41.329
and a handful of people
at the top of the D.O.D.

32:41.432 --> 32:45.467
This information remains
classified, period.

32:45.569 --> 32:46.601
Are we clear?

32:46.703 --> 32:48.103
Yeah.

32:49.239 --> 32:50.638
Yes, sir.

32:52.109 --> 32:55.777
The terrorists we're
chasing aren't human.

32:55.879 --> 32:59.181
We used to say the same
thing about the Hajis.

32:59.283 --> 33:00.782
Not like that.

33:05.855 --> 33:08.290
This Hunter and two others

33:08.392 --> 33:10.492
were part of a cell hiding
out in an abandoned

33:10.594 --> 33:13.161
calcium carbonate refinery in Kentucky.

33:13.263 --> 33:16.664
They were part of a larger,
international organization.

33:16.766 --> 33:21.388
The U.S. government first became
aware of their existence in 2009.

33:24.108 --> 33:26.475
This some kind of hoax?

33:32.583 --> 33:35.750
Does this look like a hoax to you?

33:52.345 --> 33:53.944
Hunter Number Seven,

33:54.013 --> 33:55.679
AKA Lionel McCarthy.

33:55.748 --> 33:58.949
He's a professional DJ who
uses the name Cymatic Society.

33:59.018 --> 34:00.751
Have we reached out to T.S.C.?

34:00.820 --> 34:02.453
McCarthy's on their watch list.

34:02.522 --> 34:03.754
He may attempt to travel
to the Middle East,

34:03.823 --> 34:06.957
where as far as we know,
Brother Number Four is based.

34:07.026 --> 34:08.092
That's their leader.

34:08.161 --> 34:11.929
He's like the bin Laden
of little green men.

34:11.998 --> 34:14.866
If McCarthy's on the no-fly list,
he won't get past security.

34:14.867 --> 34:16.300
Or an X-ray machine.

34:16.369 --> 34:19.370
He wont have to get past
all of them, just one.

34:19.438 --> 34:23.007
Randall Slavich runs security
at an airport near D.C.

34:23.074 --> 34:25.176
We suspect he's a sleeper agent.

34:25.245 --> 34:27.311
We've been monitoring his
communications for weeks,

34:27.380 --> 34:28.978
and our surveillance turned up nothing

34:29.047 --> 34:31.349
until last night, when Slavich received

34:31.417 --> 34:35.018
this link from McCarthy via
McCarthy's Spotify chat.

34:37.790 --> 34:39.889
That song was playing in the farmhouse.

34:39.958 --> 34:42.659
O.M.D., Orchestral
Manoeuvres in the Dark.

34:42.728 --> 34:44.695
'80s British New Wave group.

34:44.764 --> 34:47.231
They did that song, "If You Leave."

34:47.300 --> 34:48.366
It was in... "Pretty in Pink"

34:48.434 --> 34:50.768
- in the last scene, when Andie...
- Jules.

34:50.835 --> 34:52.570
My guess is that it's
an encoded message.

34:52.639 --> 34:54.272
I think McCarthy's telling Slavich

34:54.340 --> 34:56.340
that he needs help getting
out of the country.

34:56.409 --> 34:59.143
Slavich's next shift
starts in four hours.

34:59.212 --> 35:02.980
We're gonna take a team, stake
it out, see if McCarthy shows.

35:03.049 --> 35:05.416
Abby Carroll may turn up with McCarthy.

35:05.485 --> 35:07.485
And if she does?

35:07.554 --> 35:10.655
She's to be apprehended and
held for interrogation.

35:10.723 --> 35:12.890
That is all. Let's go, people.

35:12.958 --> 35:14.659
Let's bring 'em in this time.

35:19.632 --> 35:22.099
Hunters use sonic weapons.

35:22.168 --> 35:23.234
The two-eighty.

35:23.303 --> 35:25.269
- That's two-eighty as in...
- Decibels.

35:25.338 --> 35:26.737
Well, look at you with the science.

35:26.806 --> 35:28.239
E.T.U. weapons are reverse engineered

35:28.308 --> 35:30.040
using Hunter guns that we've seized.

35:30.109 --> 35:32.410
Battery snaps out, in, like so.

35:32.478 --> 35:34.679
Aim for the head. That's
how you take one down.

35:34.747 --> 35:37.014
There'll be a muffled
sound, some kickback.

35:37.083 --> 35:38.949
You'll get used to the feel.

35:39.018 --> 35:40.518
Like spooning a lover.

35:42.922 --> 35:45.523
A gun that shoots Martians.

35:46.049 --> 35:47.858
We don't know where they come from.

35:47.927 --> 35:50.261
Could be space. No one knows for sure.

35:50.330 --> 35:53.044
What we do know is that
Hunters don't come in peace.

35:53.499 --> 35:56.634
Stay calm, keep focused
and whatever you do,

35:56.703 --> 35:59.069
stay the hell away from this one.

36:01.989 --> 36:06.579
MARYLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

36:11.251 --> 36:13.851
She had a secret.

36:13.919 --> 36:14.852
Your wife.

36:14.920 --> 36:18.123
Something you didn't know.
Something that got her caught.

36:18.124 --> 36:20.524
You don't know anything about Abby.

36:20.593 --> 36:22.593
Everyone's hiding something.

36:27.533 --> 36:29.800
Sir, you need to hear this.

36:29.869 --> 36:32.803
On the surface, just another lame remix,

36:32.872 --> 36:34.938
but when we pull the tracks apart,

36:35.007 --> 36:37.275
that's when things get interesting.

36:44.584 --> 36:47.485
Those clicks were on the tape
from the Coahuila factory.

36:47.553 --> 36:49.887
Yeah, we'll see. We'll
start cracking it.

36:49.955 --> 36:51.088
That's not all, sir.

36:51.157 --> 36:53.357
There was another track
buried in the song.

36:53.426 --> 36:55.493
No code, no attempt to hide it.

36:55.561 --> 36:58.462
- What is it?
- It's a warning, sir.

36:58.531 --> 37:00.898
This is a warning from our leader,

37:00.966 --> 37:02.933
dear Brother Number Four.

37:03.002 --> 37:05.436
This is his one and only warning,

37:05.505 --> 37:07.805
so sit up and listen close.

37:07.873 --> 37:10.941
For years we have remained
hidden amongst you,

37:11.010 --> 37:13.110
watching, waiting.

37:13.179 --> 37:15.513
We take nothing without reason.

37:15.581 --> 37:19.550
What we want is good and right.

37:19.619 --> 37:21.786
It's what we've been waiting for.

37:23.189 --> 37:24.755
Their first direct communication,

37:24.824 --> 37:26.957
and it's a damn manifesto.

37:27.026 --> 37:28.459
Our cause is just.

37:28.528 --> 37:31.028
The end justifies our means.

37:31.096 --> 37:33.030
Love swings the hammer.

37:33.098 --> 37:36.534
Blood will be shed.

37:36.602 --> 37:40.538
You will bleed, you will cry,

37:40.606 --> 37:42.406
and you will die.

37:44.410 --> 37:46.377
You will not be safe.

37:46.446 --> 37:48.212
You will pay the price.

37:48.280 --> 37:51.281
We are many, we are everywhere,

37:51.351 --> 37:53.351
and we are angry.

37:53.419 --> 37:56.520
The end begins now.

37:58.758 --> 38:00.023
Escalator.

38:00.092 --> 38:02.426
McCarthy's here, headed to security.

38:02.495 --> 38:03.494
Alone?

38:03.563 --> 38:04.895
- Looks like.
- Stay with him.

38:04.964 --> 38:05.996
We're on him.

38:23.015 --> 38:25.416
We're at baggage carousel one.

38:25.485 --> 38:27.685
Slavich's letting McCarthy
through a secure door.

38:27.754 --> 38:29.186
We're in pursuit.

38:48.140 --> 38:50.608
Briggs, Slavich's been hit.

38:50.676 --> 38:52.175
He's heading to the service hangar.

38:52.244 --> 38:53.911
I'm on my way.

40:15.061 --> 40:16.327
Slavich!

40:21.167 --> 40:23.000
Slavich, stop!

40:24.270 --> 40:27.271
Tell me where my wife is.

40:27.373 --> 40:28.506
Tell me!

40:29.775 --> 40:32.110
Tell me where my wife is,

40:32.212 --> 40:34.678
or I'll blow your damn head off.

40:55.001 --> 40:56.200
Hello, Allison.

40:59.038 --> 41:01.172
You can't stop us.

41:01.274 --> 41:03.541
We're inside.

41:03.643 --> 41:05.643
Inside what?

41:06.712 --> 41:09.747
The E.T.U.

41:09.849 --> 41:11.415
We're inside.

41:11.518 --> 41:13.017
They're using you.

41:15.821 --> 41:17.221
Carroll?

41:18.991 --> 41:22.226
Where's Regan? Where's McCarthy?

41:24.964 --> 41:28.799
What a fine and fearsome
creature you are.

41:28.901 --> 41:30.834
Magnificent in every way.

41:30.936 --> 41:32.036
You don't know me.

41:32.138 --> 41:33.737
Oh, but I do.

41:33.839 --> 41:36.141
I know what's inside of both of us,

41:36.142 --> 41:41.379
and I know how badly
it wants to come out.

41:41.481 --> 41:43.881
Go on. Shoot me.

41:43.983 --> 41:46.931
Spill my blood, then lick it up,

41:46.932 --> 41:49.820
and then run with me
like the animal you are.

41:58.331 --> 41:59.363
He's got a gun!

41:59.465 --> 42:01.065
No!

42:09.676 --> 42:11.676
Holy shit.

42:11.777 --> 42:14.144
He escaped. He got a shot off first.

42:15.305 --> 42:21.922
