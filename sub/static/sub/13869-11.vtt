WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:03.180
MITCH: A year ago,
the animals started acting strangely,

00:03.204 --> 00:04.505
but no one noticed...

00:04.538 --> 00:05.573
(growling)

00:05.606 --> 00:06.750
until they began attacking,

00:06.774 --> 00:08.509
coordinating,

00:08.542 --> 00:09.543
evolving.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.412
The animals were mutating,

00:11.445 --> 00:13.223
and it was happening faster
than anyone expected.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.115
(screaming)

00:14.148 --> 00:16.517
The government came
up with a plan.

00:16.550 --> 00:17.627
PSA NARRATOR: Thanks
to the Noah Objective,

00:17.651 --> 00:20.388
in six to ten years,
the world's animal population

00:20.421 --> 00:22.723
will be thriving once again.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.793
You cannot exterminate
every animal on the planet

00:25.826 --> 00:27.195
and then repopulate it.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.729
MITCH: But messing
with Mother Nature

00:28.762 --> 00:30.531
could be catastrophic,

00:30.564 --> 00:32.375
so a group of us are
trying to save the animals.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.802
Jackson Oz and Abraham Kenyatta,

00:34.835 --> 00:36.404
animal experts.

00:36.437 --> 00:37.838
Dariela Marzan,

00:37.871 --> 00:39.140
army ranger.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.708
Jamie Campbell,

00:40.741 --> 00:43.477
a reporter who's been
following this story, found me,

00:43.511 --> 00:46.680
Mitch Morgan,
a veterinary pathologist.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.550
Together,
we're going to find a cure

00:49.583 --> 00:51.719
for the animals.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.621
Time is running out.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.224
Previously on Zoo...

00:56.257 --> 00:57.758
Jackson! (gunshot)

00:57.791 --> 00:59.293
He ran to the vehicle bay.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.495
He's gone.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.731
We can't do anything
without Jackson.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.366
I found something in
your blood results

01:05.399 --> 01:06.534
I thought you should know.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.569
ALLISON: Those horses
in England weren't

01:08.602 --> 01:10.504
ignoring everyone else;
they were targeting you.

01:11.472 --> 01:12.473
Because you're pregnant.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.275
You gonna tell everybody?

01:14.308 --> 01:16.610
That is what I was
going to ask you.

01:16.644 --> 01:19.480
Everything you said lined up
with a Noah Objective scientist

01:19.513 --> 01:20.848
we spoke with two days ago.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.850
His name is Dr. Robert Oz.

01:22.883 --> 01:23.884
It is a scary thing

01:23.917 --> 01:26.787
to realize the mutation
has jumped to humans.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.722
I must convince the
Cabinet of Ministers.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.425
They're meeting in
Washington in two days.

01:31.459 --> 01:33.437
I need you to come with me
to the embassy and convince

01:33.461 --> 01:36.230
the Minister of Defense
that we're close to a cure.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.865
Your father has
something I need.

01:37.898 --> 01:40.634
And he won't give it to
me unless he sees you.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.136
I'm willing to turn myself in,

01:42.170 --> 01:43.771
but I need proof
that you've got him.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.240
Sir, the field team just
called from the safe house.

01:46.274 --> 01:47.241
Robert Oz is gone.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.143
I want Jackson Oz dead.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.312
DAVIES: If we kill his son,
Robert Oz will find us.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.116
We should run.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.154
♪

02:07.661 --> 02:08.795
Any sign of Jackson?

02:08.829 --> 02:09.797
No. (Sighs)

02:09.830 --> 02:13.234
There are reports of
shots fired at IADG HQ.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.502
Great. Any casualties? Unclear.

02:14.535 --> 02:15.879
Story's not being picked
up by the news outlets.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.314
I'm piecing things
together from social media.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.740
MITCH: We're gonna need
surveillance at the IADG

02:19.773 --> 02:20.784
and surrounding traffic cams.

02:20.808 --> 02:21.875
Working on it.

02:22.943 --> 02:23.811
Here we go.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.747
Says here shots were
fired at 4:23 p.m.

02:26.780 --> 02:27.780
Fast-forward.

02:29.683 --> 02:30.651
Is that...?

02:30.684 --> 02:31.719
Robert Oz.

02:33.321 --> 02:36.190
Okay. Go to traffic cams.

02:38.326 --> 02:39.660
There.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.829
So that's 12th Street.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.497
There should be
another camera at G.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.899
ABRAHAM: They're heading north.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.501
Where is Robert taking him?

02:47.535 --> 02:49.837
We should be able to pick
him up at New York Avenue.

02:51.972 --> 02:52.873
Maybe they turned.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.675
Try Massachusetts.

02:56.877 --> 02:57.945
13th and M?

03:00.448 --> 03:01.982
They're gone.

03:02.015 --> 03:05.386
So, the Great and Powerful Oz.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.821
Crazy son of a bitch
is still alive.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.791
And now he has the one thing
that he has coveted the most.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.293
Jackson.

03:15.296 --> 03:18.499
(helicopter whirring
in distance)

03:18.532 --> 03:20.968
You lost Robert Oz?

03:21.001 --> 03:22.236
He disappeared, sir.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.441
He's a scientist,
not a sorcerer.

03:27.475 --> 03:30.311
You understand that without
him, we can't fix the TX gas.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.913
All the clean DNA in
the world won't help us

03:32.946 --> 03:34.982
if we can't first
wipe the slate clean.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.350
Yes, sir, I know.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.351
There's more.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.019
We just got word
from the Russians.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.830
It looks like they're voting
to reject the Noah Objective.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.623
They're making the
decision today.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.958
Don't you worry about the
Russians; I got that covered.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.528
You just find Robert
Oz and his mutant son.

03:50.964 --> 03:51.965
(door opens)

03:54.602 --> 03:56.042
JAMIE: Abe,
you've been up all night.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.905
You need to get some rest. No.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.473
We're running out of time.

03:59.507 --> 04:02.042
The Noah Objective launches
in less than 48 hours.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.010
ALLISON: Maybe not.

04:03.043 --> 04:06.347
I just got off the phone
with Leonid Ivankov.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.749
He believes he's
convinced enough ministers

04:08.782 --> 04:11.952
to vote against Davies to pull
out of the Noah Objective.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.454
Will that shut Davies down?

04:13.487 --> 04:14.622
JAMIE: In a heartbeat.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.957
His plan is to drop the gas
in the Siberian jet stream

04:16.990 --> 04:18.992
and spread it all
over Northern Europe.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.962
Without Russia,
the Noah Objective's done.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.465
Thanks to you,
and your little talk with Ivankov.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.075
Nice... nice work.
ALLISON: Jamie was very useful,

04:26.099 --> 04:28.035
but the ministers
still need to hear

04:28.068 --> 04:30.003
from the architect of the cure.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.773
The, um, tie-wearing architect.

04:34.007 --> 04:37.378
Nobody who ever saved the
world needed to wear a tie.

04:37.411 --> 04:40.381
Fine. Change into whatever
people who save the world wear,

04:40.414 --> 04:41.915
and meet me in the vehicle bay.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.985
No, I'm just gonna stay here and
continue looking for Jackson.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.763
But we have Vera Salvon
secured in a safe zone.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.055
She can synthesize the cure.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.358
So? So we don't need Jackson.

04:50.391 --> 04:53.727
I'm not going anywhere
until I find Jackson.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.763
And I'm staying with him.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.040
MITCH: All right,
how about this?

04:57.064 --> 04:57.965
Divide and conquer.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.368
You guys go crash the
Oz family reunion,

05:00.401 --> 05:02.770
and we'll go restart the Cold
War, okay?

05:02.803 --> 05:04.838
Sounds like a plan.

05:10.578 --> 05:13.747
I... I just can't
help thinking that

05:13.781 --> 05:17.951
if I had told Jackson about my
history with his father earlier,

05:17.985 --> 05:20.421
we could've avoided all of this.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.657
You were trying to
protect Jackson.

05:25.626 --> 05:29.530
Sometimes it's hard to find...

05:29.563 --> 05:32.566
the right moment
to share a secret.

05:34.602 --> 05:37.371
Secrets are just
another kind of lie.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.108
That's not the way you
treat people you love.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.479
Right.

05:45.513 --> 05:46.914
Coffee?

05:46.947 --> 05:48.616
Sure.

06:00.160 --> 06:03.564
(rumbling, whirring in distance)

06:03.597 --> 06:06.133
Dariela, did you hear...

06:08.736 --> 06:09.870
Jackson. (tires screech)

06:09.903 --> 06:12.740
Jackson, I'm-I'm sorry, rafiki,

06:12.773 --> 06:14.742
about everything.
No, Abe, I'm-I'm sorry.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.720
I-I did not mean... What happened?
We saw you with your father,

06:16.744 --> 06:19.012
and then where did you go?

06:19.046 --> 06:21.157
He knew where to go,
where-where Davies couldn't find us.

06:21.181 --> 06:24.184
And everything was fine,
but then he tried to poison me.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.596
What? I don't know what happened,
but, Abe, we got to get out of here.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.131
We got to get this plane up in the
air, because Davies

06:28.155 --> 06:29.723
is gonna be looking for us.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.892
Jackson, Jackson,
where is your father?

06:32.926 --> 06:34.762
Right there.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.871
Did Davies do this?

06:45.873 --> 06:47.808
I think I did.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.780
♪

07:31.985 --> 07:34.788
On my count. One, two...

07:34.822 --> 07:37.090
A little heads-up on the
takeoff would've been nice.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.191
Is this Jackson's car?

07:38.225 --> 07:39.226
We need to get out of.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.629
U.S. airspace before
General Davies can find us.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.530
Okay?

07:42.563 --> 07:43.731
You...

07:43.764 --> 07:45.232
Jackson.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.735
You were supposed to put me...
Jackson. Jackson, come.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.236
We need to restrain him!
(grunting)

07:49.269 --> 07:51.572
Jackson, no, stop!

08:03.216 --> 08:05.653
We had a deal.
You were supposed to put me down,

08:05.686 --> 08:07.988
not just shoot me.
You didn't do it, you coward.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.298
I want you to see
what you've done.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.534
Go over there,
see what you've done.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.225
(grunting)

08:14.094 --> 08:15.529
(Jackson snarls)

08:16.830 --> 08:17.865
The defiant pupil.

08:17.898 --> 08:18.898
(grunts)

08:20.968 --> 08:22.836
We're trying to help
you, Jackson.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.071
This isn't Jackson.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.573
We're doing this
for your safety.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.650
We'll be right back, rafiki.

08:26.674 --> 08:27.908
Come. Help me.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.209
JACKSON: Where are you going?

08:29.242 --> 08:32.111
Abe, don't do it!
Don't help him!

08:32.145 --> 08:34.782
He's evil. Don't trust him.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.249
He did this to me.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.284
You hear me? Don't trust him.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.589
(growling breaths)

08:41.621 --> 08:43.624
(door closes)

08:56.369 --> 08:58.939
ALLISON: The Russians have to
believe that we have the cure.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.674
Which would be a full-on lie.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.610
I could tell them we're close.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.953
But we're still
short one animal...

09:03.977 --> 09:06.146
An animal that's been
extinct for 14,000 years.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.948
So we're really not that
close, are we?

09:07.981 --> 09:10.951
I told them that,
but I left out the extinction part

09:10.984 --> 09:13.954
and the mysterious
island of Pangaea.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.890
Just get up there, smile,
and tell them that we can fix it.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.291
We'll figure out the rest later.

09:18.325 --> 09:21.128
Says the woman who doesn't
have to figure it out later.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.062
Mitch,
some people are born great.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.264
Others have greatness
thrust upon them.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.332
This is your chance.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.967
To become one of the thrusted?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.602
JAMIE: Minister Ivankov.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.671
Ms. Campbell.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.641
This is my wife Sabine,

09:33.674 --> 09:35.208
my daughter Tasha.

09:36.644 --> 09:37.811
(clears throat) Ms. Shaw.

09:37.845 --> 09:39.780
And you must be
Professor Morgan.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.650
I am. Thank you very
much for having us.

09:42.683 --> 09:43.851
Don't thank me.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.319
Just convince my cabinet that
your cure is our only option.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.287
That's exactly what we'll do.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.957
Not "we." You won't be
attending, Ms. Shaw.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.292
You're a high-ranking U.S.
government official.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.895
It cannot appear as though we
are pushing the U.S. agenda.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.997
Very well.
I will meet with you both

09:57.030 --> 09:58.799
after the vote is called.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.367
Good luck.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.173
These are the people
who are going to make

10:06.206 --> 10:08.175
so you can ride a
real horse again.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.977
You are going to
fix the animals?

10:11.111 --> 10:14.081
Uh, that's the plan, yeah.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.118
How's Jackson?

10:18.151 --> 10:20.788
He's... calmed down,

10:20.821 --> 10:22.389
but he's still not himself.

10:22.422 --> 10:25.092
(animals calling) (rumbling)

10:26.927 --> 10:28.361
(hissing)

10:35.102 --> 10:36.770
(animals chittering)

10:36.804 --> 10:39.072
Do you think they are
reacting to Jackson?

10:39.106 --> 10:41.008
(electricity zapping)

10:46.246 --> 10:48.248
Hard to say.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.955
You ever hit your old man?

10:54.988 --> 10:57.691
If I had tried to hit my father,

10:57.725 --> 11:00.293
that would have been the
last thing I had ever done.

11:00.327 --> 11:04.965
I got mad at my pops,
plenty of times.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.700
Never enough to hit him.

11:06.734 --> 11:10.103
Jackson says he
tried to poison him.

11:10.137 --> 11:13.406
Poison? Really?
I wouldn't put it past him.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.879
Dariela.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.782
This man is not to be trusted.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.388
(grunts)

11:33.493 --> 11:35.763
Abraham.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.166
You've grown.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.738
Hello, Professor.

11:44.772 --> 11:48.008
Uh-huh. Where's Jackson?

11:48.041 --> 11:50.778
He's in the other room.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.212
We had to restrain him.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.213
Who are you?

11:53.246 --> 11:54.447
Not important.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.784
Ah, very well, Not Important.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.351
Can you bring me my bag?

11:58.385 --> 12:00.420
Now, why would I do that?

12:00.453 --> 12:01.989
It's for Jackson.

12:02.022 --> 12:05.158
His brain chemistry's
betraying him.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.294
He doesn't have control.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.097
You have to trust me.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.832
Trust you?

12:11.865 --> 12:13.266
After all that you've done?

12:13.300 --> 12:15.402
That's right.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.772
If you want to help Jackson,
then you have to trust me.

12:18.806 --> 12:22.175
Now, please, bring me my bag.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.448
Sir, Dulles tower just reported

12:28.481 --> 12:31.351
an unauthorized departure
matching the tail number.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.187
It's them. You have confirmation
that Robert Oz is on board?

12:34.221 --> 12:35.498
They're not responding
to radio signals.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.357
Take that as a yes.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.827
Keep talking to Dulles
tower, track the plane,

12:39.860 --> 12:40.970
and then get me Admiral Rader.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.295
Yes, sir.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.199
What the hell is in here?
(quiet growling)

12:46.233 --> 12:48.869
Easy, easy.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.470
(gasps)

12:50.503 --> 12:52.372
Oh, that's disgusting!

12:55.608 --> 12:57.244
Oh...

12:58.245 --> 13:00.347
(hissing, growling)

13:00.380 --> 13:02.349
Is that a badger?

13:02.382 --> 13:04.051
It is.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.786
And it really doesn't
like Not Important.

13:09.923 --> 13:13.393
Badger's spray and saliva

13:13.426 --> 13:16.830
are some of the most
acidic compounds on Earth.

13:21.201 --> 13:24.237
Can you find a home
for our little friend?

13:24.271 --> 13:27.474
How's this gonna help Jackson?

13:27.507 --> 13:29.843
In nature,

13:29.877 --> 13:32.079
acids accelerate decay,

13:32.112 --> 13:34.347
breaking down organic compounds.

13:34.381 --> 13:37.284
In Jackson, I'm hoping

13:37.317 --> 13:39.887
to restore balance

13:39.920 --> 13:41.922
to his brain chemistry...

13:43.656 --> 13:46.193
break down the spreading
tendrils of the mutation.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.628
A mutation that you
inflicted upon him.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.598
And you tricked me to
inflict upon his mother.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.600
I know you're angry.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.535
But please...

13:55.568 --> 13:58.972
don't let your anger get in
the way of helping Jackson.

13:59.006 --> 14:02.275
His anger already cost
me one dose of this.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.945
The poison.
Did you try to give this to Jackson

14:04.978 --> 14:06.513
when you were with him earlier?

14:06.546 --> 14:08.415
It did not go well.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.217
Look, I can't fix him,

14:10.250 --> 14:12.219
but I can help him
if he'll let me.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.553
If you'll let me.

14:13.586 --> 14:17.390
Abraham,
whatever you think of me,

14:17.424 --> 14:20.627
you have to know that I'm
a man who loves his son.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.863
(sighs)

14:27.134 --> 14:29.136
(growling breaths)

14:31.504 --> 14:32.672
Hello, Jackson.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.007
(grunts)

14:35.642 --> 14:37.244
You're gonna have to trust me.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.412
Why would I ever trust you?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.283
Because I'm your father.

14:43.316 --> 14:46.153
I buried my father...

14:46.186 --> 14:47.554
two years ago.

14:47.587 --> 14:51.959
Take this, and I'll explain why.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.241
♪

15:25.392 --> 15:27.927
There you are.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.530
Dad?

15:32.732 --> 15:35.235
TROTTER: We've got
an incoming call.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.736
From who?

15:36.769 --> 15:39.939
General Davies.
He's asking to speak to Robert Oz.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.544
Okay. Patch him through.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.313
DAVIES: Professor Oz?

15:46.346 --> 15:48.715
You're mistaken. He's not here.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.251
Smart choice to leave U.S.
airspace.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.387
Small snag: you are headed
straight for the USS Kettner,

15:54.421 --> 15:58.025
and all its F-18s are fueled up
and itching to get in the air.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.127
I'm here, Davies.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.995
There's no need to
do anything rash.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.998
We had a deal.
Now, you have your son back,

16:05.032 --> 16:06.675
you give me the real
formula for the TX gas

16:06.699 --> 16:08.435
or your little
reunion will end up

16:08.468 --> 16:10.603
on the bottom of the Atlantic.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.639
(line clicks)

16:17.510 --> 16:20.513
You will explain in detail
how the cure is being made,

16:20.547 --> 16:23.016
how you will disperse
it into the world.

16:23.050 --> 16:25.785
The Cabinet will take a
vote, but it is symbolic.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.188
I've already
convinced the majority

16:28.221 --> 16:32.025
that the Noah Objective is
short-sighted and aggressive.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.802
Well, when the Russians think
a plan is too aggressive,

16:33.826 --> 16:35.128
you know something's wrong.

16:35.162 --> 16:38.298
The meeting is about to
begin, sir.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.499
Thank you.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.201
This DNA bank

16:41.234 --> 16:44.104
they plan to use to restart
the animal population...

16:44.137 --> 16:46.473
Can they prove it's viable?

16:46.506 --> 16:49.209
Even if it is,
the ecosystem will be destroyed.

16:49.242 --> 16:53.180
90% of all plants rely on
animals for pollination.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.382
What would humans eat
if all of the animals

16:55.415 --> 16:57.317
and 90% of plants are just gone?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.186
It would take decades
to restore balance,

16:59.219 --> 17:01.421
if we even survive that long.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.256
Davies has said none of this.

17:03.290 --> 17:06.059
(elevator bell dings)

17:06.093 --> 17:07.973
Well, somebody's been
paying attention in class.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.633
(animal growling,
man screaming) (gunshot)

17:13.665 --> 17:15.234
(crowd murmuring)

17:15.268 --> 17:16.502
What the hell was that?

17:16.536 --> 17:17.804
(gunfire)

17:17.837 --> 17:19.271
(crowd clamoring, screaming)

17:19.306 --> 17:21.074
(roaring)

17:26.779 --> 17:28.781
Sabine! Tasha!

17:28.815 --> 17:30.083
Get back!

17:30.550 --> 17:31.550
Tasha!

17:36.789 --> 17:38.525
(pounding, growling continues)

17:48.268 --> 17:49.836
We have to go back down there!

17:49.869 --> 17:51.304
We will, sir! Hold on!

17:51.338 --> 17:52.805
There's security everywhere.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.341
I'm sure Tasha and
Sabine are safe.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.610
There's no one picking up.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.346
No signal.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.614
Which should be expected,
'cause we're in a metal box.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.584
Yeah, well,
we got to get out of the metal box.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.321
(gorilla howling, roaring)

18:10.190 --> 18:13.793
This is where being in a
metal box works in our favor.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.331
(roaring)

18:22.302 --> 18:23.570
(men grunting)

18:28.441 --> 18:29.309
Fighter jets?

18:29.342 --> 18:31.178
How long will it
take him to find us?

18:31.211 --> 18:33.380
F-18s... 15, 20 minutes.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.781
Why does Davies think

18:34.814 --> 18:37.184
that you have the
TX gas formula?

18:37.217 --> 18:38.718
But he can't shoot us
down, not when

18:38.751 --> 18:40.253
he needs something from Robert.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.322
Because I created the TX gas.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.523
You created the TX gas?

18:43.556 --> 18:45.458
You want to kill all the animals

18:45.492 --> 18:47.260
and 2.2 million people?

18:47.294 --> 18:48.361
It's complicated.

18:48.395 --> 18:49.929
Think again... Davies is firmly

18:49.962 --> 18:52.232
in the "shoot now,
ask questions never" camp.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.234
We need to turn off
our transponders.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.769
But we're too close to
standard flight paths.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.906
It'd be different if
we had an EMP on board.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.774
I could build an EMP.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.377
Now you want to kill the pilots?

19:04.411 --> 19:05.854
The electromagnetic
pulse won't kill them,

19:05.878 --> 19:07.380
it'll kill their planes.

19:07.414 --> 19:10.317
That's what ejector
seats are for.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.784
You really think that'll work?

19:11.818 --> 19:14.221
It's just as cuckoo as
every other plan we've had.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.723
We cut the power to the
plane, fire the EMP,

19:16.756 --> 19:18.725
then turn our power back on.
ROBERT: Jackson,

19:18.758 --> 19:20.293
I know you have a
lot of questions,

19:20.327 --> 19:21.828
and I will answer them all.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.831
But first,
we have to build a bomb.

19:26.533 --> 19:29.769
We need alligator clips,
batteries, copper wire.

19:29.802 --> 19:32.872
I am not doing anything with
you until you give me answers.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.574
All right,
what would you like to know?

19:34.607 --> 19:36.943
Everything.
Why are you working for Davies?

19:36.976 --> 19:38.378
Why'd you fake your death?

19:38.411 --> 19:39.846
Where have you been?

19:39.879 --> 19:43.216
I know this may be hard
for you to believe...

19:43.250 --> 19:46.719
but everything I've ever done
was for you and your mother.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.388
You are a lying piece...

19:48.421 --> 19:50.657
I understand that you're upset.
You understand nothing!

19:50.690 --> 19:53.493
I killed her because of you.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.861
Who? Mom.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.763
Yeah.

19:56.796 --> 20:00.500
I killed Mom because of you.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.870
Because you turned her
into something horrible.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.938
So I put an end to it.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.375
Jackson, I had no idea.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.676
I never meant... Yes, you did!

20:09.709 --> 20:12.745
You created what she became.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.447
What I am becoming.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.785
I am so sorry.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.020
I was trying to protect you.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.555
You can't expect
me to believe that.

20:22.589 --> 20:25.292
I knew what was coming.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.760
And when the animals
changed, I wanted to know

20:27.794 --> 20:29.862
that you and your
mother would survive.

20:29.896 --> 20:33.533
I had no idea that you would
experience these side effects.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.535
The lab burned down.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.836
My research was cut short.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.339
I burned down the
lab, so it's my fault?

20:39.372 --> 20:41.341
No, of course not.
I'm not blaming you.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.509
Quite the opposite.

20:42.542 --> 20:46.746
You saw a situation
that troubled you.

20:46.779 --> 20:50.583
And you took a drastic action
to protect someone you love.

20:51.751 --> 20:55.021
We're not so
different, you and I.

20:55.054 --> 20:58.024
And you and I will both be
falling out of the sky soon

20:58.057 --> 20:59.726
if we don't get this done.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.832
(gorilla roaring)

21:05.865 --> 21:07.500
Hurry up!

21:07.534 --> 21:09.902
We're trying. Not all of us
are built like you, Mr. Clean.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.574
New plan. Get back!

21:18.945 --> 21:19.979
Is he dead?

21:20.012 --> 21:22.281
I think so.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.919
(screaming)

21:26.953 --> 21:28.755
(gunfire)

21:28.788 --> 21:29.756
Shut that!

21:29.789 --> 21:31.324
(Sven screaming)

21:35.695 --> 21:37.464
(gorilla roaring)

21:43.536 --> 21:45.838
We have to get out of here.

21:45.872 --> 21:49.008
(gorilla growling)

21:50.042 --> 21:51.411
(electricity crackles)

21:51.444 --> 21:53.446
This reminds me of
your third grade

21:53.480 --> 21:55.014
science fair project,
do you remember?

21:55.047 --> 21:55.948
No.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.083
You made a crystal radio,

21:57.116 --> 21:58.918
so you could try
to hear the aliens.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.520
It was a hell of a radio.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.755
What I do remember is
getting a phone call

22:02.789 --> 22:05.492
telling me that my
dad had gone crazy

22:05.525 --> 22:07.536
and thrown himself overboard
while deep-sea fishing.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.095
Oh, and that he drowned.

22:09.128 --> 22:10.630
That was years later.

22:10.663 --> 22:11.764
So what happened?

22:11.798 --> 22:12.932
Why'd you do it?

22:15.802 --> 22:17.970
I had a lab in Japan.

22:18.004 --> 22:18.971
On the island.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.373
Off of Fukushima.

22:20.407 --> 22:21.717
Yeah,
I know; Abe and I were there.

22:21.741 --> 22:22.985
Your dear old dad at his finest.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.478
I was discovered by
a group of people

22:25.512 --> 22:29.549
who thankfully looked past the
eccentric nature of my work.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.117
They recruited me to be part

22:31.150 --> 22:33.052
of a para-government
organization.

22:33.085 --> 22:36.856
I didn't know exactly who
these people were at the time.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.401
All that mattered was
that they believed me.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.092
They suggested that my research

22:40.126 --> 22:42.495
could be done more effectively
if I was off the grid.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.063
Meaning dead.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.468
Well, then how'd you
wind up with Davies?

22:48.501 --> 22:51.638
When the animals changed,
these people that recruited me

22:51.671 --> 22:53.440
told the government
that I wasn't

22:53.473 --> 22:56.476
quite as dead as they'd assumed.

22:56.509 --> 22:59.479
I started working on what
became the Noah Objective.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.080
Of course, everything changed

23:01.113 --> 23:02.157
when I learned
what was happening

23:02.181 --> 23:04.417
to the A3GC carriers.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.052
A3GC? The gene responsible

23:06.085 --> 23:07.920
for your mutation.

23:07.954 --> 23:10.723
We call that the ghost gene.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.825
That's a much cooler name.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.427
When I learned

23:14.461 --> 23:17.196
the ghost gene carriers were
experiencing side effects,

23:17.229 --> 23:19.098
I sabotaged my work on the gas.

23:19.131 --> 23:22.769
I demanded that Davies find
you, and I started working

23:22.802 --> 23:25.738
on ways that I could help you.

23:28.508 --> 23:30.977
Mom and I thought
that you were crazy.

23:32.679 --> 23:37.216
Turns out that you
were right all along.

23:37.249 --> 23:40.019
"Those who were seen dancing
were thought to be insane

23:40.052 --> 23:41.988
by those who could
not hear the music."

23:42.021 --> 23:43.856
You had that written
on a Post-it note

23:43.890 --> 23:46.659
in the Subaru by the radio.

23:46.693 --> 23:49.061
Nietzsche.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.197
Now, that you remember.

23:53.700 --> 23:54.601
(roaring)

23:54.634 --> 23:56.736
(pounding)

23:56.769 --> 23:58.838
We got to get these doors open.

23:58.871 --> 23:59.872
(gorilla roaring)

23:59.906 --> 24:01.140
Just in case we can't,

24:01.173 --> 24:04.477
have I thanked you lately for
dragging me into this adventure?

24:04.511 --> 24:05.778
Come to think of it, no.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.747
Thank you. Been a real treat.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.015
Come on! You know, I could've

24:09.048 --> 24:11.784
waited out the animal apocalypse
from the comfort of my couch.

24:11.818 --> 24:14.220
But where's the fun in that?

24:14.253 --> 24:15.493
You two should get bigger room!

24:18.525 --> 24:19.759
(grunts)

24:19.792 --> 24:20.760
(gasps)

24:20.793 --> 24:22.695
Let's go. (gorilla roaring)

24:22.729 --> 24:24.196
(people murmuring, screaming)

24:24.230 --> 24:25.732
Let me help you down.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.539
Oh, oh, excuse me.

24:32.572 --> 24:33.873
D-Do you know what's happening?

24:33.906 --> 24:35.250
The animals are
still in the lobby.

24:35.274 --> 24:36.943
The police are here,
but we don't know

24:36.976 --> 24:38.754
if they've contained them;
we don't know where to go.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.714
If that gorilla gets out
here, he's gonna slaughter

24:41.748 --> 24:43.983
all these people, and us.

24:44.016 --> 24:44.951
Fireman key.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.219
There's no fireman or key.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.188
If we can jam the key,
we can send the elevator

24:49.221 --> 24:51.691
back down to the lobby; it'll
take the gorilla with it.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.228
Hi. Uh...

24:56.262 --> 24:58.164
Can I borrow your shoe? What?

24:58.197 --> 25:00.032
Oh. Yeah. Give him your shoe.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.774
Brilliant. All right,
we got to get back in there.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.175
Back in? You can't do that.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.309
It will kill you.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.644
Just... we'll be fine.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.118
Just get these people
someplace safe.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.615
Everybody, follow me.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.227
All right, I've got to get all
the way back into the elevator,

25:19.251 --> 25:22.021
jam the key, and then get back
out before it cuts me in half.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.522
Sounds good. I'll watch.

25:30.062 --> 25:33.299
(gorilla howling, roaring)

25:34.967 --> 25:36.211
You're gonna have
to hoist me up.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.312
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know the drill.

25:37.336 --> 25:38.971
Well,
try to do it before King Kong

25:39.005 --> 25:40.272
rips my throat out, okay?
Uh-huh.

25:40.306 --> 25:44.010
TROTTER (over intercom): Got two
inbound aircraft heading our way.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.813
100 miles out.
Be on us in five minutes.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.314
Five minutes is generous.

25:48.347 --> 25:51.851
You're sure this thing isn't
going to fry our plane?

25:51.884 --> 25:53.986
EMP's directional
if it's wired right.

25:54.020 --> 25:57.256
Let's just hope Jackson's
dad knows what he's doing.

25:57.289 --> 25:58.825
Yeah.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.860
Say this thing actually works.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.962
Davies will just
send another plane,

26:02.995 --> 26:05.598
or have men waiting
for us when we land.

26:05.632 --> 26:08.300
And even if we do
actually escape,

26:08.334 --> 26:10.302
Jackson is still sick.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.238
And we're nowhere near a cure.

26:12.271 --> 26:16.943
We're just putting a Band-Aid
over a hatchet wound.

26:16.976 --> 26:18.377
What's wrong with you?

26:18.410 --> 26:20.279
What do you mean?

26:20.312 --> 26:23.249
When we met,
you were sunshine and bubble baths.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.618
We found a cure once
and we'll find it again.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.194
Perhaps you were
right all along.

26:35.227 --> 26:38.130
I don't want to be right.
I want to be wrong.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.368
Uh, it's just that

26:42.401 --> 26:45.071
taken all that has happened,

26:45.104 --> 26:49.308
you have to ask,
you have to wonder,

26:49.341 --> 26:52.645
why should we believe that our
future is any better than today?

26:52.679 --> 26:54.914
You cannot do this to me.

26:56.348 --> 26:59.986
You, of all people,
cannot give up on the future.

27:01.387 --> 27:02.388
Dariela.

27:04.423 --> 27:06.392
(distorted, echoing):
Dariela, are you all right?

27:06.425 --> 27:08.427
Oh, my God.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.829
Dariela! Oh, my God.

27:09.862 --> 27:12.765
Dariela! Dariela.

27:20.372 --> 27:22.108
I need help!

27:23.142 --> 27:24.410
What happened?

27:24.443 --> 27:25.945
I don't know.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.747
She just collapsed.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.121
Of course.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.456
I should have known when
the badger sprayed her.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.158
Known what?

27:39.191 --> 27:41.093
That she's pregnant.

27:41.127 --> 27:43.329
Pregnant? ROBERT: Yes.

27:43.362 --> 27:44.864
The carboxylic acids I harvested

27:44.897 --> 27:48.200
from the badger,
they attack duplicating cells.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.202
They don't distinguish
between cells

27:50.236 --> 27:51.804
that are duplicating
towards death

27:51.838 --> 27:53.105
and towards life.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.207
Dariela is pregnant.

27:55.241 --> 27:58.044
Uh, it would appear so.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.746
Any idea who the father is?

27:59.779 --> 28:02.114
Yes.

28:02.148 --> 28:03.950
Quite a good idea.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.217
Could she lose the baby?

28:05.251 --> 28:07.219
Not if we act fast.

28:07.253 --> 28:09.421
Please, do something. Of course.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.090
Wait.

28:11.123 --> 28:13.492
Dariela. Dariela, it's okay.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.994
We're going to fix this.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.062
Maybe we shouldn't.

28:16.095 --> 28:19.732
Animals are drawn to me.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.300
I'm a target. I'll just...

28:21.333 --> 28:23.102
I'll keep bringing
heat to the team.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.937
No. We can handle it.

28:24.971 --> 28:27.073
(groans): What
about what you said?

28:27.106 --> 28:30.142
About the future?

28:30.176 --> 28:32.779
Do we really want to bring
a child into this mess?

28:32.812 --> 28:35.281
Yes.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.016
Yes, we do.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.252
You can't answer that quickly.

28:40.286 --> 28:43.155
Before, I was wrong.

28:43.189 --> 28:46.158
But now I have
something to fight for.

28:48.027 --> 28:50.429
Unless you don't want to.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.131
I do.

28:52.164 --> 28:54.100
I think.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.835
But only if you're
sure, Bubble Bath.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.005
'Cause I can't do this alone.

29:04.944 --> 29:07.814
Please...
can you do what you can?

29:07.847 --> 29:10.917
Let's see if we can't neutralize
the effects of the acid.

29:11.951 --> 29:14.353
TROTTER (over intercom):
They found us.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.822
(jets whooshing)

29:15.855 --> 29:18.858
You need to put the EMP in place.
Now.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.860
I'll be back.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.364
(gorilla roaring, pounding)

29:25.397 --> 29:26.365
You ready?

29:26.398 --> 29:28.034
Yeah, as ready as I'll ever be.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.007
(gorilla roaring)

29:41.013 --> 29:42.014
(grunts)

29:42.915 --> 29:43.950
(roaring)

29:45.084 --> 29:46.361
Okay, that's it.
I'm pulling you out.

29:46.385 --> 29:47.887
No, I can almost reach it.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.459
(grunts) Okay, now, now!

29:54.226 --> 29:55.895
(elevator bell dings)

30:00.967 --> 30:02.301
(roaring fades)

30:02.334 --> 30:04.336
(panting)

30:08.340 --> 30:10.342
(chittering)

30:12.879 --> 30:14.622
They weren't kidding
about maternal instincts

30:14.646 --> 30:16.115
kicking in and all that.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.249
How so?

30:17.283 --> 30:19.485
'Cause all of a sudden,
I'm more worried

30:19.518 --> 30:22.388
about this potion
working than the F-18s

30:22.421 --> 30:24.857
turning us into a
fiery afterthought.

30:24.891 --> 30:27.393
Welcome to parenthood.

30:28.895 --> 30:32.498
The word "I" will disappear
from your vocabulary.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.033
You'll never go to sleep

30:34.066 --> 30:36.068
without thinking of
your child first,

30:36.102 --> 30:38.971
never again blow
out birthday candles

30:39.005 --> 30:40.539
and make a wish for yourself.

30:40.572 --> 30:43.309
Got to say, you talk good game

30:43.342 --> 30:45.611
for a guy who ran
out on his family.

30:47.313 --> 30:49.882
Not every parent knows
how to share their truth.

30:51.450 --> 30:54.020
Doesn't make their love a lie.

30:54.053 --> 30:56.989
Yeah, but you also kind of

30:57.023 --> 30:59.926
turned your family into
mutants, didn't you?

31:02.594 --> 31:04.931
I'm afraid this isn't
gonna be pleasant.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.867
Now, that I believe.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.442
Welcome to parenthood, right?

31:16.475 --> 31:19.078
Yes. Welcome to parenthood.

31:20.947 --> 31:22.414
(groans quietly)

31:25.217 --> 31:27.253
(sighs)

31:27.286 --> 31:30.923
Abe, you're gonna be a father.

31:30.957 --> 31:34.093
Yes. If we can manage not
to get shot out of the sky,

31:34.126 --> 31:35.394
I'm going to be a father.

31:35.427 --> 31:38.430
And you, you have a father again.
Yeah.

31:38.464 --> 31:42.368
If we manage not to get
shot out of the sky, then...

31:42.401 --> 31:43.702
I guess I do.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.080
TROTTER: They're
coming in for the kill.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.538
You better work your magic.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.040
We need to go, now.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.976
Okay, open the gate,
I'll finish this. Okay.

31:52.544 --> 31:55.047
(alarm blaring)

31:55.081 --> 31:57.950
(gate opening)

31:57.984 --> 31:59.351
(quietly): Okay,
okay, okay, okay.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.959
It's great to have you
back, rafiki.

32:06.993 --> 32:08.560
Good to be back.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.372
We need to go.
We need to power it up now.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.649
Trotter...

32:30.682 --> 32:32.184
cut the power!

32:32.218 --> 32:33.485
Now!

32:35.254 --> 32:37.423
(electricity pulses)

32:43.529 --> 32:45.531
(electricity whirring)

32:47.466 --> 32:49.068
It worked.

32:51.337 --> 32:53.239
ROBERT: You feeling better now?
Be better soon.

32:53.272 --> 32:56.008
(panting)

32:56.042 --> 32:58.777
Your lab's a little
short of seat belts.

32:58.810 --> 33:02.114
I thought it would be best to buckle
up, just in case.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.615
Are you...

33:03.649 --> 33:06.285
are you all right? Yeah.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.429
Let's just get one
thing straight.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.297
Just because I'm pregnant,
we're not gonna turn this

33:09.321 --> 33:11.490
into a whole overprotective
thing, right?

33:12.691 --> 33:14.193
JACKSON: Great.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.494
So you're still... Knocked up?

33:15.527 --> 33:18.297
That's what the doc tells me.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.166
I think the baby's
gonna be fine.

33:20.199 --> 33:23.102
I was able to reverse
the effects of the acid.

33:23.135 --> 33:25.304
Just steer clear of badgers.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.772
And otters.

33:26.805 --> 33:29.175
Actually, to be safe,

33:29.208 --> 33:32.244
let's give a wide berth to
the entire Mustelidae family.

33:32.278 --> 33:33.645
Copy that.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.215
Robert...

33:37.716 --> 33:39.718
I don't know what to say.

33:39.751 --> 33:42.088
Oh.

33:43.789 --> 33:46.225
(sighs)

33:46.258 --> 33:48.394
I know that you may never
be able to forgive me

33:48.427 --> 33:50.129
for Elizabeth.

33:50.162 --> 33:52.831
Both of you have the
right to hate me.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.709
But I hope eventually
you'll believe me when I say

33:54.733 --> 33:57.736
all I wanted was
the best for her.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.705
And you.

34:02.474 --> 34:05.544
Nice work.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.379
I wish I could say the same.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.748
You panicked.
You almost pulled me too soon.

34:11.617 --> 34:14.320
Well, you've already
lost a toe for this team.

34:14.353 --> 34:17.322
I think losing an arm or a head

34:17.356 --> 34:19.757
would just be showing off.
(chuckles)

34:22.428 --> 34:26.532
You know,
when we can manage to be...

34:26.565 --> 34:30.168
civil, we still make
a pretty good team.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.840
Yeah,
but where's the fun in that?

34:42.914 --> 34:44.650
MAN: Anybody up here?

34:44.683 --> 34:47.319
Lobby's been secured.
It's safe to come down.

34:50.856 --> 34:53.525
(sizzling)

34:53.559 --> 34:57.396
You know, no one's used the
stove since we've been here.

34:57.429 --> 35:00.799
Microwave, yeah, but stove, no.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.668
Can hardly blame you.

35:02.701 --> 35:05.704
With all the globe-trotting
and world-saving.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.439
But after the stunt we pulled,

35:07.473 --> 35:08.674
we deserve a home-cooked meal.

35:08.707 --> 35:11.677
Or at least some
melted cheese on bread.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.545
We've changed courses,
away from the carrier,

35:13.579 --> 35:15.214
so we should be okay.

35:15.247 --> 35:17.349
Davies will have
trouble finding us.

35:17.383 --> 35:19.751
But we're gonna have to
go back at some point.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.553
Find the others, refuel.

35:21.587 --> 35:24.590
And Davies will
probably find us then.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.426
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

35:29.428 --> 35:32.731
First, please tell me you
remember me making you

35:32.764 --> 35:34.200
grilled cheese sandwiches.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.701
What's with all these questions

35:35.734 --> 35:37.369
about what I remember?

35:37.403 --> 35:39.538
Guess I wanted to see where
I stood in your memories.

35:39.571 --> 35:41.340
Is it all mad scientist?

35:41.373 --> 35:44.643
Or if there's still
some good in there.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.713
Like crystal radios.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.348
Crystal radios.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.683
Grilled cheese sandwiches.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.652
Chess.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.854
I remember chess.

35:55.887 --> 35:56.755
You were good at chess.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.557
I was not good at chess.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.492
You beat me every
time we played.

36:00.526 --> 36:03.495
Not every time. Pender Island?

36:03.529 --> 36:07.366
That's right.
I did beat you once.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.368
You didn't let me win, did you?

36:09.401 --> 36:10.536
No, not even close.

36:10.569 --> 36:11.703
I always told you

36:11.737 --> 36:12.704
that you needed to think...

36:12.738 --> 36:13.939
Five moves ahead.

36:13.972 --> 36:15.541
I remember.

36:15.574 --> 36:16.808
And I did.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.577
And it was never good enough.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.546
It was enough that day.

36:20.579 --> 36:23.715
You were thinking five, six,

36:23.749 --> 36:25.717
even seven moves ahead.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.586
And you demolished me.

36:28.787 --> 36:32.458
That was the happiest
loss of my life.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.660
I was so proud of you.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.662
I am so proud of you.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.864
The man you've become.

36:38.897 --> 36:40.766
The work you've done.

36:40.799 --> 36:43.302
This is all very impressive.

36:43.335 --> 36:45.437
Hardly.

36:45.471 --> 36:46.972
What are you talking about?

36:47.005 --> 36:48.974
The sloth,

36:49.007 --> 36:52.678
the snake.

36:52.711 --> 36:56.382
All Triple-Helix, I'm guessing.

36:56.415 --> 36:59.785
You figured out the cure.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.654
No one in the government's
even come close.

37:02.688 --> 37:04.690
Yeah, well, that's just it.

37:05.991 --> 37:08.527
(sighs)

37:08.560 --> 37:12.030
We're close,
but that's not good enough.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.799
We, uh...

37:13.832 --> 37:18.003
we have to find a...
saber-toothed cat.

37:18.036 --> 37:20.339
Ooh,
that does present a challenge.

37:20.372 --> 37:22.341
What with their being extinct.

37:22.374 --> 37:25.344
There's a rumor that we
can find one on an island.

37:25.377 --> 37:26.745
Called Pangaea.

37:26.778 --> 37:29.047
(jet whooshing)

37:29.080 --> 37:30.449
(rattling)

37:31.483 --> 37:33.952
How'd Davies find us?

37:40.826 --> 37:42.828
(indistinct police
radio chatter)

37:47.733 --> 37:49.535
ALLISON: I'm so sorry.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.606
Are you okay?

37:56.475 --> 37:58.877
I-I came back as soon as
I heard about the attack.

38:05.351 --> 38:07.853
His daughter was killed.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.888
Along with 14 other people.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.024
They're not, um...

38:13.058 --> 38:15.026
they're not still on
board, are they?

38:15.060 --> 38:16.595
Would you be?

38:18.830 --> 38:21.066
Well,
this doesn't change the facts.

38:21.099 --> 38:24.403
The Noah Objective is still
gonna cost many, many more lives

38:24.436 --> 38:25.913
in the long run.
Try explaining to a man

38:25.937 --> 38:28.374
whose daughter was just
murdered by a crazed gorilla

38:28.407 --> 38:30.642
that any plan to rid the
world of crazed gorillas

38:30.676 --> 38:32.544
isn't a plan worth pursuing.

38:32.578 --> 38:34.980
I gave everything that I have

38:35.013 --> 38:35.814
to this team.

38:35.847 --> 38:38.684
I... believed in
what we were doing.

38:38.717 --> 38:39.885
But we lost.

38:39.918 --> 38:43.088
We just played our last card.
The gas is going to drop,

38:43.121 --> 38:45.323
and the world is never
gonna be the same.

38:47.393 --> 38:50.829
We made the animals our
enemies, the monsters.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.331
But we're the monsters.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.703
And now we're gonna punish
them for our mistakes.

38:57.736 --> 39:00.038
No.
Look, we'll find another way.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.374
Find another way.
For the first time in my life,

39:02.408 --> 39:04.576
I wish that you were
right and I was wrong.

39:04.610 --> 39:07.045
The plane is all yours,
but I have to get back to work.

39:08.747 --> 39:10.982
I couldn't help you save the
animals, but I can help

39:11.016 --> 39:14.686
the people of this country try
and survive whatever comes next.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.523
I, um,

39:17.556 --> 39:19.925
wish the best for you both.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.927
Jamie, would you mind?
Could I have a minute?

39:22.961 --> 39:25.130
Um...

39:25.163 --> 39:26.865
Allison, listen, I...

39:26.898 --> 39:29.167
It's okay. It is.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.769
I see the way that
you look at her.

39:30.802 --> 39:32.904
I know that you think that...

39:32.938 --> 39:36.775
she's special and you're
meant to be together.

39:36.808 --> 39:39.077
But as someone who
knows you very well...

39:40.846 --> 39:42.548
you're not.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.883
You're going to
destroy each other.

39:46.952 --> 39:49.054
Good-bye, Mitch.

40:11.142 --> 40:13.044
DAVIES: Excellent work.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.647
The attack was more
effective than I expected.

40:15.681 --> 40:18.517
You didn't tell me there
would be children there.

40:18.550 --> 40:21.119
If your conscience is bothering
you, feel free to donate this

40:21.152 --> 40:24.022
to the widows of the
Russian officials.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.066
That's one problem solved.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.935
We may have solved another one.

40:36.968 --> 40:39.505
You have an incoming call.
From Robert Oz.

40:39.538 --> 40:40.906
Excellent. Sir.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.074
What about the security guard?

40:43.108 --> 40:44.576
Take care of him.

40:48.179 --> 40:50.916
I've just e-mailed you
the correct formula.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.151
Test it.
I assure you it will work.

40:53.184 --> 40:55.120
Now leave me and my son alone.

40:55.153 --> 40:56.154
(beep)

40:59.290 --> 41:00.626
How could you do that?

41:00.659 --> 41:02.894
We underestimated him.

41:02.928 --> 41:06.097
He'd just send another
plane and then another.

41:06.131 --> 41:08.066
You just gave him
the TX gas formula.

41:08.099 --> 41:10.268
You are killing all the animals

41:10.301 --> 41:13.204
and me and anyone else
with the ghost gene.

41:13.238 --> 41:17.543
No. What I'm doing is
thinking seven moves ahead.

41:17.576 --> 41:19.144
How can you say that?

41:19.177 --> 41:22.213
I need you to turn off
the plane's transponders

41:22.247 --> 41:25.150
and give your pilot this.

41:25.183 --> 41:26.284
What is this?

41:26.317 --> 41:28.219
I'm taking you to
meet my friends.

41:28.253 --> 41:30.055
Your friends? That's right.

41:30.088 --> 41:32.190
They've been
waiting to meet you.

41:32.223 --> 41:35.026
Together, we will fix
you, fix the animals

41:35.060 --> 41:37.028
and save the world.

41:37.062 --> 41:39.030
After everything that
we have been through,

41:39.064 --> 41:41.232
how do you expect
me to believe a word

41:41.266 --> 41:42.901
that you are saying to me?

41:42.934 --> 41:45.036
It'll all become
clear in Pangaea.

41:45.070 --> 41:46.304
Pangaea? That's right.

41:46.337 --> 41:49.675
I'm taking you to meet my
friends, the Shepherds,

41:49.708 --> 41:53.178
who live on the
island of Pangaea.

42:05.156 --> 42:06.825
(beep)

42:06.858 --> 42:09.027
Trotter,

42:09.060 --> 42:11.029
I need you to turn
off the transponders

42:11.062 --> 42:13.565
and go to the
following coordinates.
