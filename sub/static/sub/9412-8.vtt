Is that why they call you
Sheena of the jungle?

00:48.400 --> 00:50.900
Hey, Sheena,
there's something down here.

00:50.900 --> 00:53.867
Forget it. I'm not falling for
another one of your dumb jokes.

00:54.867 --> 00:57.367
- Look at it.
- What is it?

00:58.367 --> 01:00.367
I don't know.

01:00.367 --> 01:02.867
Looks like a-- a shark's tooth.

01:03.367 --> 01:07.867
No way. I mean, any shark with
a tooth that big would have to be--

01:14.500 --> 01:16.200
Somebody's here.

- They go all the way to the door.

Whatever it was, I'm sure it left.

01:22.233 --> 01:25.733
I don't know about that.
Maybe he just came in.

01:27.233 --> 01:30.033
Wow.
Look at this place.

01:31.033 --> 01:33.533
I wouldn't touch that
if I were you.

01:35.033 --> 01:37.033
- It smells like the slime.
- Really?

01:37.033 --> 01:39.033
How exciting. Now put it back.

01:39.033 --> 01:41.033
No way. I'm gonna look at this
underneath a microscope.

No, Billy. We've been
down here long enough.

- Let go, okay?
- You let go.

01:44.533 --> 01:47.400

- Yeah, and I'm gonna have it last!

[ Screams ]

02:00.200 --> 02:02.200
It was Billy's idea, Uncle Harold.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.200
Oh, yeah, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.600
It doesn't matter whose idea it was.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.900
The point is,
you were told to stay out of the lab.

02:08.900 --> 02:11.933
We're working on some
very sensitive experiments in there.

- You can't go by yourself.

You may need help, Harry.
We'll all go.

I'm not gonna let you
throw away our work

02:51.700 --> 02:54.833
You can't just leave us on this island,

[ Sheena ] You think anybody's really
gonna see a fire from out there?

03:16.800 --> 03:18.800
[ Harold ]
This island's uninhabited.

03:18.800 --> 03:22.300
Any passing ship that sees
the smoke is bound to investigate.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.300
Why'd Ritter do that to us anyway?

03:24.300 --> 03:27.300
- I thought you guys were partners.
- We were.

03:27.300 --> 03:30.300
But I guess Ritter's greed
got the best of him.

03:30.300 --> 03:32.800
He wanted the D-13 all for himself.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.800
What's D-13?

03:34.800 --> 03:37.800
I guess after all this
you two deserve an explanation.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.900
Take a look out there.
What do you see?

03:40.900 --> 03:43.200
Uh... nothing.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.700
- Water. Duh.
- Well, you're both right.

03:47.700 --> 03:50.700
And wrong.

03:50.700 --> 03:53.033
The ocean's alive with
something called Plankton.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.033
It's a microscopic life-form,

03:55.033 --> 03:58.400
sort of a floating
all-you-can-eat buffet for fish.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.400
Ritter and I were working
on a new strain of it called D-13...

04:01.400 --> 04:05.200
That can turn carbon dioxide into oxygen
at four times the normal rate.

04:05.200 --> 04:09.133
But the growth hormone we used
had a side effect.

04:09.133 --> 04:12.600
It caused the creatures that ate
the Plankton to grow at an amazing rate.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.967
- Like that blowfish?
- Exactly.

04:14.967 --> 04:17.800
Then when you found
that giant shark's tooth,

04:17.800 --> 04:21.233
I knew that the plankton had somehow
made its way into open water.

04:21.233 --> 04:24.233
Maybe while Luis was cleaning
the lab equipment.

04:24.233 --> 04:27.733
At any rate, the marine life
in our cove has been feeding on it.

04:27.733 --> 04:30.233
- And growing?
- Mm-hmm.

04:32.233 --> 04:35.900
That's why I decided to stop the experiment.
It seems Ritter had other plans.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.400
Like what?

04:38.400 --> 04:41.400
Well, like making a lot of money.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.400
D-13 would be worth a fortune
to the right people.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.400
How do you make money
off of growing giant fish?

04:46.900 --> 04:49.900
You feed people. With enough
D-13 in the planet's oceans,

04:49.900 --> 04:52.400
you could end world hunger
in ten years.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.900
- That's good, isn't it?
- We don't know yet.

04:54.900 --> 04:57.900
It's never been tested on humans.
The side effects could be disastrous.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.633
Hey, guys!
I think I found something!

05:13.600 --> 05:17.100
That guy-- He must have
jumped overboard before it crashed.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.567
I don't think this boat just crashed.

05:19.567 --> 05:23.600
I think another one of our
deep-sea friends got hungry.

- It's gotta be here somewhere.

05:28.900 --> 05:31.400
- What?
- Something every boat this size has to have.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.433

was supposed to be deserted.

07:19.433 --> 07:22.433
This thing was made some time ago.

Those branches under it should have died
under the weight of the canoe.

07:27.433 --> 07:30.933
It's almost as if
someone hid it here recently.

You must believe me.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.367
He was my assistant.

17:08.367 --> 17:11.367
He had access to all my papers,
checkbooks, everything!

17:11.367 --> 17:13.367
It's too late.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.367
We will decide your fate,

17:15.867 --> 17:18.367
for your invention
has determined ours.

17:18.367 --> 17:21.367
[ Roaring, Hissing ]

17:21.367 --> 17:23.367
- No! Stop!
- Sheena!

17:23.367 --> 17:25.367
You and Billy stay back!

17:25.367 --> 17:27.867
Ritter used you all as his experiments
so he could get rich.

17:27.867 --> 17:30.367
- And we can prove it.
- How?

17:30.367 --> 17:34.833
Just think about it-- Why would
Uncle Harold, my brother and I...

17:34.833 --> 17:37.733
come to this island if we knew
what was going on?

17:37.733 --> 17:40.600
Ritter brought us here
to get us out of the way.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.333
Why?

17:42.333 --> 17:44.833
So he could have D-13 all to himself.

17:44.833 --> 17:46.333
He was probably planning to
sell it to a company

17:46.833 --> 17:48.000
with no regard for the consequences.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
So he could get rich
by hurting innocent people.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.500
[ Murmuring ]

17:55.500 --> 17:57.167
We'll go get Ritter.

17:57.167 --> 18:00.667
[ All Murmuring ]
Get Ritter! Get Ritter! Get Ritter!

18:11.100 --> 18:12.600
Huh?

18:18.100 --> 18:20.100
No.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.000
No!

18:24.833 --> 18:27.267
No! Stay away!

18:30.267 --> 18:32.267
Stay away from me!

18:41.600 --> 18:45.100
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!

18:49.767 --> 18:51.833
[ Luis ]
Hello, Dr. Ritter.

18:51.833 --> 18:54.333
Going somewhere?

18:59.133 --> 19:02.433
- [ Roars ]
- No!

19:13.400 --> 19:15.400
- See you, Luis.
- Take care.

19:24.500 --> 19:27.500
Well, that's the last of the antidote.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.167
Good.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.167
According to my calculations,

19:31.167 --> 19:33.600
that should get rid of
all traces of D-13.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.100
Okay, uh, what about the giant fish?
The others?

19:36.100 --> 19:38.100
Once the antidote starts to work,

19:38.100 --> 19:41.100
they should revert to normal size
within the next 48 hours.

19:41.100 --> 19:43.100
How are you feeling?

19:43.100 --> 19:46.100
I couldn't be better.
I haven't got a fin or scale on me.

19:46.100 --> 19:49.600
But I've kind of, uh,
lost my taste for seafood.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.533
[ Chuckling ]

19:52.533 --> 19:54.533
I promise you guys,

19:54.533 --> 19:57.533
the rest of your vacation
will be completely normal.

19:57.533 --> 20:00.500
No mad scientists, no monsters.
Just a nice, quiet summer.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.000
Good.
Just one thing, though.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.500
What do you think happened to Ritter?

20:06.500 --> 20:10.167
Yeah. He sorta disappeared
after those fish people got hold of him.

20:11.667 --> 20:14.667
Well, I don't think
we've heard the last of him.

20:14.667 --> 20:17.033
Guys like Ritter
always show up sooner or later.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.400
[ Female Barker ]
Come on down, folks!

20:22.400 --> 20:24.400
See the fish man!

20:24.400 --> 20:27.400
He's half man and half fish!

20:27.400 --> 20:29.900
And he's alive! Come on down!

20:29.900 --> 20:31.900
Oh, don't be shy, sweetie.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.900
Go on in.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.367
See, he's the fish man!
Half man, half fish!

20:37.367 --> 20:42.367
You won't believe it!
You have to see it with your own eyes!

20:43.867 --> 20:45.867
Man, what a rip-off.

20:45.867 --> 20:48.867
That looks totally fake.
