WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:11.595
I'll be right down!

00:15.348 --> 00:17.475
Hey. Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:17.560 --> 00:18.602
<i>That's all right.</i>

00:18.686 --> 00:23.023
<i>It's the same price,</i>
<i>whether I'm waiting or playing.</i>

00:23.106 --> 00:24.232
<i>At least you're cute.</i>

00:25.150 --> 00:27.152
How do you know?
You can't even see me.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.487
<i>Well...</i>
<i>You sound cute.</i>

00:31.114 --> 00:33.534
All I'm saying is that trying to achieve

00:33.617 --> 00:35.661
any true level of intimacy
over the Internet

00:35.744 --> 00:39.081
is like trying to
save the environment using oil.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.625
<i>Mmm, I love scented oils.</i>

00:42.668 --> 00:43.669
<i>Are you hard?</i>

00:47.047 --> 00:50.383
<i>So... if you don't want to do that...</i>

00:51.551 --> 00:52.678
<i>what do you wanna do?</i>

00:53.929 --> 00:55.848
I want you tell me about
when you were happiest.

01:19.037 --> 01:22.082
<i>I thought I was never gonna see her again.</i>

01:22.165 --> 01:24.710
<i>And it made me so happy to...</i>

01:24.793 --> 01:26.670
<i>to know she was gonna be okay.</i>

01:26.754 --> 01:28.046
<i>You know?</i>

01:28.130 --> 01:29.339
That's beautiful.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.486
What?

01:51.569 --> 01:55.282
<i>You really do sound hot.</i>
<i>Like, dad hot.</i>

01:55.365 --> 01:57.660
Yeah. Thanks. Uh...

01:57.743 --> 02:02.455
Look, Candy, you seem like a lovely girl,
and I'm sorry for what's about to happen,

02:02.539 --> 02:03.791
but this conversation is over.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.417
<i>But we just--</i>

02:39.367 --> 02:42.620
Traveler 4019... welcome to the 21st.

02:42.705 --> 02:43.872
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:43.956 --> 02:46.083
<i>Status report!</i>
<i>Everyone all right?</i>

02:46.166 --> 02:48.710
<i>All set. Let's get to work.</i>

02:48.794 --> 02:50.670
<i>Someone should check on Donner.</i>

03:46.309 --> 03:49.104
We've got multiple bodies
and remnants of the bomb out back.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.605
Uh-huh.

03:50.688 --> 03:53.650
Yeah, it looks like some kind
of adult industry webcam operation.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.068
Anything on these cameras?

03:55.152 --> 03:57.237
Nah, they're all fried.
Even the servers.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.572
- Survivors?
- None.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.867
The bomb was placed
right next to the gas line.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.745
- Where's the bomber's body?
- No idea.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.371
Local PD are canvassing the neighborhood

04:06.454 --> 04:08.081
to see if anyone saw
them leaving the scene.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.582
He's alive?

04:09.666 --> 04:11.418
Well, assuming it's a "he."

04:11.501 --> 04:14.421
Forensics should be here
any minute to do a sweep.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.339
I'm gonna go back
to the office,

04:16.423 --> 04:19.592
see what I can dig up about
the victims and this company.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.595
- Make me do the dirty work?
- I called it.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.057
Philip, you there?

04:25.140 --> 04:26.266
<i>What happened?</i>

04:26.349 --> 04:28.351
None of the girls survived,
and Donner's missing.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.436
<i>Missing?</i>

04:29.519 --> 04:31.521
He should be dead.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.190
If the traveler arrived,
he'd have defused the bomb

04:33.273 --> 04:35.108
like he was supposed to.
And if he misfired--

04:35.192 --> 04:37.110
Donner would have died.
I know.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.653
It doesn't make any sense.
What do you want to do?

04:38.737 --> 04:40.363
<i>Search the deep Web. Run SOS.</i>

04:40.447 --> 04:42.365
If the traveler made it,
hopefully he'll reach out.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.827
In the meantime,
send me the host's address.

04:44.910 --> 04:45.911
<i>Copy.</i>

04:54.502 --> 04:56.338
-Hi.
-Hey.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.547
You wanted to see me?

04:57.630 --> 04:59.674
Trevor, yes.
Uh, please have a seat.

05:01.093 --> 05:03.929
How're you doing?
Everything okay?

05:05.222 --> 05:07.015
Transcendent.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.392
Uh, I wanted to talk to you
about your physics midterm last week.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.394
Uh... Not bad, right?

05:11.478 --> 05:13.521
Well... also not good.

05:13.605 --> 05:16.108
I had a meeting
with Mr. Morrissy yesterday,

05:16.191 --> 05:17.567
and he believes you've been cheating.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.237
What?
That's ridiculous. I--

05:20.320 --> 05:21.989
Well, he wants to give you a zero.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.781
No, I mean, I put in the work.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.784
I got 90%. I told you I would.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.287
You believe him?

05:29.371 --> 05:33.500
You got every question right
except the last three.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.835
-Yeah, they were--
-Which were also correct,

05:34.918 --> 05:37.837
but you scratched out
to not seem suspicious.

05:38.796 --> 05:41.008
Now, Mr. Morrissy thinks
you had the answer key,

05:41.091 --> 05:43.010
and to be honest, Trevor,
it's hard to dispute that.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.137
I'm sorry.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.974
What are the repercussions?

05:49.057 --> 05:51.184
Well, I found a compromise.

05:51.268 --> 05:54.771
I have convinced him
to allow you one more crack at the midterm

05:54.854 --> 05:56.731
under both of our supervision tomorrow.

05:56.814 --> 06:00.068
Oh, uh... Okay.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.696
Why don't you come by
for third period today

06:03.780 --> 06:05.240
and I'll help you study?

06:07.242 --> 06:08.493
I'll be there.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.630
Oh, no!

06:21.673 --> 06:22.840
Hi!

06:22.925 --> 06:25.052
Gonna be extra good
for Mommy today, okay?

06:41.651 --> 06:42.694
Hey.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.322
Hey. I just got your message.
Jeffrey will be fine.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.033
The rash is just a common reaction
to a vaccine.

06:48.116 --> 06:51.036
But I can come over
and check on him later, if you'd like.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.288
Uh, thank you, but no, that's okay.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.748
-I... I have a meeting.
<i>-A meeting?</i>

06:58.501 --> 07:00.295
I have a hearing today.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.589
Jeffrey's father wants custody.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.466
<i>Oh, why don't you just let him have it?</i>

07:04.549 --> 07:05.592
I'm the boy's mother.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.635
No, actually, you're not.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.762
And it would make it a lot easier
to go on missions.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.307
I'm not leaving my son
in the custody of that man,

07:12.390 --> 07:14.059
<i>and that's all there is to it.</i>

07:14.142 --> 07:16.394
Well, then you're gonna
have to fight for him.

07:16.478 --> 07:17.812
I know.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.078
Oh, my God.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.621
Oh, my God!

07:34.704 --> 07:36.914
Oh, my God!
No!

07:38.041 --> 07:39.417
No!

07:40.335 --> 07:44.589
Oh, this is all my fault!
This is all my fault.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.346
- <i>Hey, boss?</i>
- Yeah?

07:51.429 --> 07:53.681
<i>-I sent you Donner's address.</i>
-Thanks.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.183
Hey, if you were injured in the field

07:55.267 --> 07:57.477
and needed to patch yourself up,
where would you go?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.604
<i>Pharmacy, veterinary clinic...</i>

08:01.939 --> 08:05.235
Hold on...
I'll get back to you.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.949
Can you help me?

08:12.034 --> 08:13.076
FBI.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.453
Is there something wrong?

08:15.537 --> 08:19.041
A hurt man came into my kitchen.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.418
He's bleeding!

08:21.501 --> 08:23.420
-You know this man?
-No.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.588
Is he still inside?

08:27.924 --> 08:29.176
Stay here.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.426
Aaron Donner. He was a regular.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.761
I'd do private shows for him,
twice a day sometimes,

09:13.845 --> 09:15.638
until things got weird.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.307
He started sending packages,

09:17.390 --> 09:19.934
and our policy is not to encourage
that sort of thing,

09:20.017 --> 09:22.104
so I didn't respond.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.981
Aaron blamed the company
for coming between us,

09:25.065 --> 09:26.274
and then the threats started.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.984
Threats?

09:28.068 --> 09:30.195
He'd send religious hate mail,

09:30.278 --> 09:33.365
saying that God would make
everyone pay for their sins,

09:33.448 --> 09:34.991
that a day of reckoning would come.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.284
He was crazy!

09:36.368 --> 09:37.827
And then this morning...

09:37.910 --> 09:39.496
You're doing good.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.624
He left me a voice mail
telling me not to come in,

09:42.707 --> 09:45.042
that today was the day
he'd make them all pay.

09:45.127 --> 09:47.504
I tried to warn the girl, but--

09:47.587 --> 09:49.964
It's okay.
You're being very helpful.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.635
Excuse me.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.811
Beth?

10:03.895 --> 10:06.856
Can you do a search
on an Aaron Donner for me?

10:23.080 --> 10:24.499
Aaron Donner?

10:53.110 --> 10:54.654
Aaron Donner!

10:58.325 --> 10:59.992
Do you know who I am?

11:01.703 --> 11:03.455
I'm 3468.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.916
If you were hurt in the blast,
I can take you to our medic.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.294
I'm here to assist you.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.547
Okay?

11:15.091 --> 11:16.426
You can trust me.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.866
These allegations are
fundamentally disgusting, David.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.409
Marcy Warton is a client of yours!

11:41.493 --> 11:43.245
She's not who you think she is.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.496
Are you in a relationship with her?

11:44.579 --> 11:45.830
It's purely platonic.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.374
So you don't deny living with her?

11:49.208 --> 11:52.962
Because I have a thorough report
from an Officer Jeff Conniker

11:53.045 --> 11:56.424
that clearly implicates you
as her romantic partner.

11:56.508 --> 11:59.511
Ken...
you know I would never do that.

11:59.594 --> 12:00.762
You're suspended until further notice.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.472
-What?
-And don't think

12:02.555 --> 12:04.891
that there won't be a full investigation,
David, because--

12:04.974 --> 12:06.976
You know, just meet with her. Please.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.103
Come see who we're talking about.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.522
That's all I'm asking.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.106
You won't change my mind.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.447
Please, be seated.

12:22.659 --> 12:26.579
Ms. Shannon, just so we're clear,
nobody's on trial today.

12:26.663 --> 12:27.830
Okay?

12:27.914 --> 12:31.751
This is just an opportunity for both sides
to state their case

12:31.834 --> 12:35.004
so we can work to find a resolution
that's best for your son.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.132
Have you no representation?

12:38.215 --> 12:40.593
Uh, actually, ma'am,

12:40.677 --> 12:43.305
I was hoping you would
consider a postponement.

12:43.388 --> 12:44.431
Sorry I'm late.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.600
I trust anything my client has said
up until this point

12:47.684 --> 12:49.644
will be struck from the record.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.648
We weren't notified
you'd be joining us, Mister...

12:53.731 --> 12:56.526
Really? Pearson.
We met twice.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.695
Right.
Sorry.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.363
If I may be frank, Your Honor,

13:00.447 --> 13:04.409
I believe my client feared the prospect
of Mr. Conniker's retribution

13:04.492 --> 13:07.286
in response to her
simply defending herself.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.831
I'm here to remind her
that she's not alone.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.557
Philip, do--

14:28.993 --> 14:30.828
Hey. Welcome home.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.456
Don't do that.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.126
Do what?

14:37.209 --> 14:38.795
That's what couples say,
when someone comes home,

14:38.878 --> 14:41.381
the other one says, "Hey, welcome home,"

14:41.464 --> 14:43.340
but we're not a couple.
It's platonic.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.553
Okay, what should I say, then?

14:46.636 --> 14:49.138
Just say hello like a normal person.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.433
Hello.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.477
Hi.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.692
What's going on?

15:00.775 --> 15:03.445
- Uh, Ken knows you're staying here.
- Ken?

15:03.528 --> 15:05.822
My boss. And I should've known
it was going to come out.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.199
-It's completely inappropriate.
-Okay, then I'll leave.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.951
I don't want you getting in trouble
for my actions.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.328
No. No, no, no.
I need you to stay.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.372
We have to prove that you're not
who they think you are.

15:15.457 --> 15:16.916
-That you're--
-Batgirl?

15:18.626 --> 15:20.795
That you're not the same person
that he met.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.214
Oh, I've met Ken?

15:23.297 --> 15:26.092
Ken... Yeah, like a dozen times.
Ken.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.719
Man, that hit on your head
really had an effect.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.471
Okay, you know what,
just tell me about him.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.180
I'll... I'll make it work.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.557
Well, I'm glad you're so confident,

15:32.640 --> 15:34.726
because I could lose my job, Marcy.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.310
Hell, I could go to jail.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.312
Okay, well, what's the plan?

15:38.395 --> 15:40.314
Right, so, it's not so much a plan

15:40.397 --> 15:43.317
as it is that he's coming
for dinner tonight.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.698
Okay.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.116
I just want what's best for my son.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.618
Then start by paying child support.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.245
Every time I come by
to talk to you about it, you assault me.

15:54.328 --> 15:57.081
- I assault you?
- Is this true, Ms. Shannon?

15:57.164 --> 15:58.583
Have you assaulted Mr. Conniker?

15:58.666 --> 16:00.460
Are we really getting into abuse here?

16:00.543 --> 16:02.169
You pay for everything in cash.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.255
-You're out crazy hours of the night.
-I'm working.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.674
And I think we all know
what your new job is.

16:06.758 --> 16:08.676
Ms. Shannon is providing for her child
as best she can.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.345
We're more concerned about
household environment

16:11.428 --> 16:12.972
as a result of manner of income.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.557
You know,
I'm just gonna come out and ask.

16:17.852 --> 16:18.895
Are you a ho now or what?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.187
Mr. Conniker!

16:20.271 --> 16:22.690
There's at least one old white guy
coming around all the time.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.359
-The money is coming from somewhere.
-You watch your mouth!

16:25.442 --> 16:26.569
-Carly, not helping.
-Shut up!

16:26.653 --> 16:29.781
You have no idea who I am
or what I'm capable of.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.240
Here's the rage
we've talked about.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.117
You haven't seen rage yet.

17:37.599 --> 17:39.767
-Freeze!
-Whoa! Easy, partner!

17:43.104 --> 17:45.773
Yeah, looks like we were just in time.
He's about to make a run for it.

17:45.857 --> 17:48.776
Packed bag, money, passport.

17:48.860 --> 17:49.861
You don't say.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.030
Tell us where you were going?

17:57.869 --> 17:59.286
Well, that went well.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.623
Fuck Protocol 3!
I want to kill that man!

18:01.706 --> 18:04.125
As your lawyer, I advise against that.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.586
<i>Philip?</i>

18:06.669 --> 18:08.087
What's up?

18:08.170 --> 18:09.589
Philip, can you arrange funds for me?

18:09.672 --> 18:11.674
I've had some unforeseen expenses.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.009
<i>Sure.</i>
<i>It'll be tomorrow.</i>

18:13.092 --> 18:15.302
Bets take a day.
How much do you need?

18:17.096 --> 18:18.389
Really?

18:19.223 --> 18:22.059
Field of reference states that
the speed of an object in motion

18:22.143 --> 18:24.646
is dictated in relation
from where you're viewing it.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.147
Good.
And how do you prove--

18:26.230 --> 18:29.776
V ax = V ay - V xy.

18:29.859 --> 18:33.487
When "y" is common in both vectors,
"y" is eliminated, and leaves for "ax"

18:33.570 --> 18:35.281
the final answer.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.326
Trevor, how have you learned all this?

18:39.410 --> 18:42.579
Were you just not
applying yourself before?

18:42.664 --> 18:44.874
Now that football's over, I can be myself.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.711
I don't have to conform
to anyone's expectations.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.463
Right, but your parents,
your teachers, me...

18:51.547 --> 18:54.008
We all want you to succeed,
with or without football.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.426
You see that, right?

18:57.094 --> 18:59.013
I feel that with you, yes.

19:00.431 --> 19:01.557
Good.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.685
But I'm tired of being told
who I should be,

19:04.601 --> 19:05.812
what I should do.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.522
I want to define my own future.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.651
I have a book I think you'd like.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.410
Here.

19:38.260 --> 19:41.806
Now, uh, let's get back to it,
get you ready for the test.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.067
The cameras are off.
Talk to me.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.278
-I have nothing to say.
-I can help you.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.655
Just tell me what happened with the bomb.

19:58.740 --> 20:00.157
It blew up.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.618
Did you make any attempt to defuse it?

20:02.702 --> 20:04.411
Why would I do that?

20:04.495 --> 20:06.580
A higher power wanted that bomb to go off.

20:06.663 --> 20:10.501
Cut the bullshit. I know you're 4022.
You know I'm 3468.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.128
There's no other way this makes sense.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.423
It was my mission to greet
your team upon arrival,

20:16.507 --> 20:18.467
so you need to talk to me.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.803
The longer you stay silent,
the less we can do.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.263
There's nothing you can do.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.681
You're in a tough spot.
I get it.

20:24.766 --> 20:27.101
I messed up my first mission, too.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.686
But you're not alone.
There are other travelers.

20:29.771 --> 20:33.232
If we have some information,
we can help you out of this.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.569
What the hell is a traveler?

20:46.453 --> 20:49.999
Divide these evenly amongst five races.
Put it on...

20:51.125 --> 20:53.795
Patience and Time, Down and Doubt,

20:54.711 --> 20:59.508
Touch of Malice, The Last Word
and The Fourth Horseman.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.178
Whoa!

21:02.261 --> 21:04.889
That is a lot of cash
you're flushing down the toilet.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.934
Normally doesn't pay
to bet on the outside odds.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.393
High risk, high reward.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.198
Aaron Donner, I have a witness that claims

21:22.281 --> 21:24.826
that you were
a longstanding client of hers.

21:24.909 --> 21:27.619
That is, until the company
slapped a court order on you.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.621
I follow the rule of God.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.374
I'm pretty sure "thou shalt not kill"
is in your rulebook.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.418
You were obsessed.
You terrorized the poor girl.

21:34.501 --> 21:37.629
I was saving Mindy.
She'll see that in time.

21:37.713 --> 21:41.008
You blew up her workplace
in order to save her?

21:41.092 --> 21:42.468
It was God's will.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.136
You're looking at three counts
of first-degree murder.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.471
They were sinful.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.598
They were?

21:47.681 --> 21:50.142
Well, it's gonna take
some kind of divine intervention

21:50.226 --> 21:52.436
to save you from lethal injection.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.231
Capital punishment?

21:55.314 --> 21:57.733
The state of Washington
carries the death sentence

21:57.817 --> 22:01.487
for first-degree murder charges
with aggravated reasons.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.990
- I want a lawyer.
- Now he wants a lawyer.

22:04.907 --> 22:07.368
Yeah, we still got you
for an hour and seven minutes

22:07.451 --> 22:09.286
before the presence
of a lawyer is mandatory.

22:09.370 --> 22:10.913
Then I'll wait.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.456
But I'm done talking.

22:40.609 --> 22:41.777
Marcy, I g--

22:54.623 --> 22:56.375
<i>Hi, David.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

22:56.458 --> 22:57.709
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

22:59.420 --> 23:01.505
I'll let you know
when the forensics come in.

23:01.588 --> 23:02.924
Thanks, partner.

23:17.939 --> 23:19.606
Hi! So glad you could join us.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.651
-Marcy?
-Ken.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.447
We got your text
that you were running late.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.741
David is just opening the wine,
and I think dinner is almost ready.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.077
How goes the battle?

23:31.160 --> 23:33.079
- Uh...
- Yeah.

23:33.662 --> 23:36.498
-David said your dog was sick.
-My--

23:37.499 --> 23:39.293
No, he's fine.
It was indigestion.

23:39.376 --> 23:40.377
Oh.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.048
This is Marcy?

23:44.131 --> 23:46.133
This is Marcy.
And, uh...

23:46.217 --> 23:48.177
now you know
why I wanted you to see her.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.013
I don't want to rush dinner,
but everything's ready, so...

23:51.097 --> 23:52.806
Do you want to just get started?

23:52.889 --> 23:53.975
I hope you're hungry.

23:54.058 --> 23:56.935
David made his famous pasta dish.

23:57.019 --> 23:58.020
Huh.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.232
Well, it's always that or chicken.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.275
Yeah.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.944
I'm sorry, Marcy,
you're gonna have to help me here.

24:06.028 --> 24:07.571
I'm confused.

24:07.654 --> 24:11.950
I understand you have some concerns
about David's conduct regarding me,

24:12.034 --> 24:15.121
but I can assure you that not only
am I no longer in his care,

24:15.204 --> 24:17.498
but that our relationship
is purely platonic.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.501
Platonic?

24:21.918 --> 24:23.337
Marcy?

24:24.671 --> 24:27.133
Excuse me. Uh, work.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.555
Hey, sorry, I know I'm breaking protocol,
but my com--

24:33.639 --> 24:35.891
- I'm interrupting.
- Agent MacLaren!

24:35.974 --> 24:37.768
Don't be ridiculous.
Why don't you come and join us?

24:37.851 --> 24:39.978
You know what, David?
This'll just take a second.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.367
It's a little late for a home visit.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.661
I don't mind.
Nice summer evening.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.289
Given what transpired
at the meeting today,

24:58.372 --> 24:59.790
I wanted to follow up.

24:59.873 --> 25:02.334
And... I have a warrant this time.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.754
Come on in.

25:16.348 --> 25:19.560
It's all pretty much the same
as last time you were here,

25:19.643 --> 25:21.895
except for the john in my closet,
of course.

25:21.978 --> 25:23.814
- Ms. Shannon.
- Carly.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.399
Carly.

25:25.482 --> 25:29.070
I didn't agree with how some aspects
of the meeting were handled...

25:29.153 --> 25:30.696
but your behavior was concerning.

25:30.779 --> 25:33.031
Yeah, I can tell by how
you're inside my house again.

25:33.115 --> 25:34.783
I'm not on anyone's side but Jeffrey Jr.

25:35.492 --> 25:39.288
My job is to make sure that
whatever happens is for his best welfare.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.123
I get that that's your job...

25:41.207 --> 25:42.916
but I'm tired of being grilled.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.295
I'm tired in general.

25:47.088 --> 25:50.299
It is so hard doing this with no help.

25:53.177 --> 25:54.636
Jeff is not a good man.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.432
And he's a cop, so I can't say anything.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.685
I can't go to anyone.

26:01.768 --> 26:03.895
He's doing this
because I won't be with him.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.356
He's punishing me.

26:07.608 --> 26:10.068
Seriously, he's FBI,
and she works with him.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.820
Though,
he can neither confirm nor deny it.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.284
It's a lot cooler when he says it.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.581
I tried to call.
Is everything all right?

26:22.664 --> 26:24.583
It will be,
but what do you need?

26:24.666 --> 26:26.918
I need you to replace my com.
It got busted.

26:27.002 --> 26:28.712
-How?
-An altercation.

26:28.795 --> 26:31.340
I don't know how, but,
apparently the new traveler's a misfire.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.634
I've been dealing with
a psychopath all day.

26:33.717 --> 26:36.094
All right, well,
I'll replace it first thing, okay?

26:36.178 --> 26:37.221
Excuse me.

26:37.304 --> 26:39.140
Can you please
show me some identification?

26:45.229 --> 26:48.106
"Special Agent Grant MacLaren."
And you are?

26:48.190 --> 26:51.026
Ken Palfy.
She works for you?

26:51.109 --> 26:55.030
-Marcy is my associate, yes.
-In what capacity?

26:56.323 --> 26:57.908
Well, that's...

26:59.785 --> 27:02.913
none of your goddamn business, Ken.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.500
Sorry for interrupting.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.834
Nice to see you again, David.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.564
Uh... Aaron Donner?

27:28.647 --> 27:30.065
Did you say anything to them?

27:30.148 --> 27:32.859
No, but they have everything.

27:32.943 --> 27:34.361
I'm familiar with your case.

27:35.111 --> 27:37.489
Right. Um, let's see here.

27:37.573 --> 27:40.158
Okay, so they found
your fingerprints on the bomb,

27:40.242 --> 27:42.661
and DNA came through with trace evidence
that places you at the scene.

27:42.744 --> 27:45.497
If I have information, can I make a deal?

27:45.581 --> 27:47.708
What, like a plea bargain?

27:47.791 --> 27:49.668
No, I want the charges dropped.

27:49.751 --> 27:52.379
I wanna go into witness protection,
new identity, everything.

27:52.463 --> 27:53.922
That's not likely.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.304
I've gained knowledge
of a secret organization

28:00.387 --> 28:02.097
that's infiltrated our society.

28:03.724 --> 28:04.725
What?

28:04.808 --> 28:06.142
There's a huge network of them.

28:06.227 --> 28:09.062
They operate outside the law,
and they're dangerous.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.566
They've even infiltrated the FBI.

28:12.649 --> 28:14.901
And how do you know all of this?

28:14.985 --> 28:16.820
One of their operatives gave himself away.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.282
I think the Defense Department
would be very interested

28:20.366 --> 28:22.409
to hear what I have to say.

28:25.496 --> 28:29.082
Okay.
What is this organization?

28:29.165 --> 28:30.792
They call themselves travelers.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.673
Agent MacLaren is one of them.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.390
You must've been born
with a horseshoe up your ass.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.894
Where's the rest of it?

28:48.977 --> 28:51.397
You got three races out of five
with those stupid odds.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.774
Consider yourself a lucky man.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.881
7-3-2-5.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.517
What?

29:45.992 --> 29:48.036
Guys, we need to assemble
back at ops ASAP.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.997
On my way.

29:51.081 --> 29:52.416
Copy.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.712
On my way. I just need to finish up
something at school.

30:01.007 --> 30:03.802
Trevor?
Your test isn't until three o'clock.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.763
Actually, Ms. Day,

30:06.847 --> 30:11.518
I wanted to thank you
for lending me that book.

30:11.602 --> 30:13.354
I really enjoyed it.

30:14.355 --> 30:16.315
You... finished it?

30:16.398 --> 30:17.983
Uh-huh.

30:18.066 --> 30:20.068
And I wanted to return the favor.

30:22.363 --> 30:27.743
It was something that gave me comfort
during a very... lonely time.

30:30.787 --> 30:32.789
Well, thank you.

30:36.793 --> 30:38.294
Enjoy.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.305
Hickman!

30:49.390 --> 30:51.558
You know he's just
gonna hang himself in there.

30:51.642 --> 30:53.935
My client wants an audience
with the DA's office,

30:54.019 --> 30:55.396
and they granted him that request.

30:55.479 --> 30:56.980
-It's his right.
-He's insane.

30:57.063 --> 30:58.732
Well, it's not for you to decide.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.359
Really?
'Cause I've pretty much already decided.

31:18.585 --> 31:19.586
Hey, you wanted to see me?

31:19.670 --> 31:21.755
Your letter of resignation
on my desk in an hour.

31:21.838 --> 31:24.800
- Turn in your ID and keys.
- What?

31:24.883 --> 31:28.178
And I think you'll understand
that I can't give you a reference.

31:28.261 --> 31:29.888
This can't still be about Marcy.

31:29.971 --> 31:31.097
What do you think?

31:31.181 --> 31:33.517
I think that you met her.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.686
You saw her.
You know what she does.

31:35.769 --> 31:39.147
Steal from people with actual disabilities
for over a year?

31:39.230 --> 31:41.357
Do you know how much
she's drained from the system?

31:41.442 --> 31:43.276
Because I do, dollar for dollar.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.821
Do you know how many grants
we've been turned down for?

31:45.904 --> 31:47.030
How many programs have been canceled

31:47.113 --> 31:50.075
because I can't rely on the government
to even keep the lights on?

31:50.158 --> 31:52.494
They won't support us but they
don't give a shit if they take from us.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.456
She didn't do any of that.
And what does this have to do with me?

31:55.539 --> 31:57.958
You helped that woman
commit social assistance fraud.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.418
I had no idea!

31:59.501 --> 32:01.086
But when you found out,
did you come to me?

32:01.169 --> 32:04.255
Did you?
Did you say, "Hey, Ken, friend, boss...

32:04.339 --> 32:06.633
Why don't you take a look at this?"

32:06.717 --> 32:10.053
No. And now we're out
her base benefits for two years,

32:10.136 --> 32:13.932
not to mention half the cost
of her apartment, outings, time.

32:14.015 --> 32:17.853
I know you did things for her
out of your own pocket.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.647
How can you not be
fucking furious at that?

32:20.731 --> 32:23.233
-It's important work she's doing.
-David...

32:23.316 --> 32:26.612
Wake up, man.
She was playing you.

32:26.695 --> 32:29.405
She was playing you then.
She's playing you now.

32:38.373 --> 32:39.541
You're right.

32:40.626 --> 32:43.419
When I thought Marcy was somebody who...

32:43.504 --> 32:46.006
needed my help...

32:46.089 --> 32:48.592
I did do things out of my own pocket...

32:50.260 --> 32:53.722
on my own time,
because I care about my clients.

32:53.805 --> 32:57.350
So, who are you gonna get
to do my case load now? Malcolm?

32:57.433 --> 32:59.310
'Cause he never does home visits.

32:59.394 --> 33:01.271
He never takes his clients
to their appointments

33:01.354 --> 33:02.814
or teaches them how to socialize.

33:02.898 --> 33:05.692
Will he know that when...
when Jason refuses to eat,

33:05.776 --> 33:08.319
you gotta pretend that
you're at his grandma's house?

33:08.403 --> 33:11.532
Or that he'll only take two...
two packs of crackers with his soup,

33:11.615 --> 33:13.575
'cause he only does things
in even numbers?

33:13.659 --> 33:17.788
I have put in more overtime than anyone,
and we don't get paid overtime!

33:17.871 --> 33:20.040
But good luck!
'Cause you're worried about a few dollars!

33:20.123 --> 33:22.959
-Try several thousand!
-Okay! Well, that's a lot!

33:23.043 --> 33:24.628
Yes, it is!

33:32.511 --> 33:33.845
Mr. Donner...

33:33.929 --> 33:35.722
the Department of Justice
doesn't take kindly

33:35.806 --> 33:37.473
to having its time wasted.

33:37.558 --> 33:40.852
In fact, that's why I'm here
and not the district attorney herself.

33:40.936 --> 33:44.230
Assistant DA Peckham,
my client stands behind his testimony.

33:44.314 --> 33:47.483
Know that we are taking this
very seriously.

33:47.568 --> 33:49.695
State your name for the camera,
then proceed.

33:49.778 --> 33:52.573
- Is the feed being broadcast in any way?
- Internal use only.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.867
My name is Aaron Donner,

33:55.951 --> 33:58.203
and I have information
on a secret organization

33:58.286 --> 34:00.205
that operates worldwide.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.915
They call themselves travelers.

34:01.998 --> 34:04.375
- A terrorist organization?
- Similar, yes,

34:04.459 --> 34:07.671
and they operate outside the law,
infiltrate government agencies.

34:07.754 --> 34:11.007
Yes, I was informed
you even implicated a federal agent.

34:11.091 --> 34:13.343
That's a very serious allegation,
Mr. Donner.

34:13.426 --> 34:14.595
Well, I was approached by him.

34:14.678 --> 34:18.389
He revealed himself as a double agent.
Said that he was part of a large network,

34:18.473 --> 34:21.602
and that if I joined them,
he could help me with my charges.

34:21.685 --> 34:23.103
Help you how?

34:23.186 --> 34:25.146
He just said that he could help me
if I was one of them.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.522
And how is it

34:26.607 --> 34:29.568
that no governmental department
is even aware of these travelers?

34:29.651 --> 34:31.236
Because they operate in secret.

34:32.528 --> 34:34.698
Mr. Donner,
I'm gonna need something more concrete

34:34.781 --> 34:36.407
than your conspiracy theories.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.368
- We're done here.
- He's right there.

34:38.451 --> 34:40.245
Why don't you ask him?
Why don't you ask...

34:40.328 --> 34:42.789
Ask him yourself.
Ask him about travelers. He knows.

34:42.873 --> 34:44.666
Aaron, you're confused.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.377
Special Agent MacLaren,
if you could please escort Mr. Donner

34:47.460 --> 34:50.255
back into federal custody,
where we can process him accordingly?

34:50.338 --> 34:51.882
No, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait!

34:51.965 --> 34:53.967
Wait! Wait!
I can prove it.

34:57.638 --> 34:58.930
I am one of them.

35:00.140 --> 35:02.100
What are you talking about?

35:02.183 --> 35:04.394
I'm Traveler 4022.

35:04.477 --> 35:06.396
And I will tell you everything.

35:06.479 --> 35:09.775
How we communicate,
how we receive our orders,

35:09.858 --> 35:12.778
our... our missions, our protocols,
just... Please.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.530
To finally live in the world above ground,
I will not give that up.

35:16.489 --> 35:18.158
I'll tell you everything.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.163
Continue.

35:23.246 --> 35:26.541
We communicate on secure servers
in the deep web.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.293
I... I can show you.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.253
You'll see messages that correspond

35:30.336 --> 35:33.048
with all the missions that we've done.
Heists, assassinations.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.966
The Van Huizen explosion?
That was us.

35:35.050 --> 35:39.304
And how can you determine
if someone is one of these travelers?

35:39.387 --> 35:42.307
We use a com device that's injected
just beneath the ear.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.309
That's how we communicate within our team.

35:44.392 --> 35:46.186
And you have
one of these devices?

35:46.269 --> 35:47.478
No, I was supposed to get one,

35:47.562 --> 35:49.564
but my team was killed
shortly after their arrival so I...

35:49.648 --> 35:52.150
-Arrival from where?
-The future!

35:56.947 --> 35:58.782
Please, I am telling the truth here.

35:58.865 --> 36:01.242
I swear. Just check... check his com.
Just look for yourself.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.953
-Look for yourself.
-Don't.

36:03.036 --> 36:06.665
Agent MacLaren was sent here
to brief me on my first mission.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.210
If I go down, you go down, too.

36:10.293 --> 36:12.879
I wish you hadn't said that.

36:12.963 --> 36:14.255
Is this true...

36:14.339 --> 36:18.301
Special Agent MacLaren?
Are you... one of these travelers?

36:24.307 --> 36:25.350
Yes.

36:26.559 --> 36:29.395
I'm Traveler 3468.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.614
And I'm not alone.

36:45.161 --> 36:49.124
Traveler 4022,
you are accused of treason.

36:49.207 --> 36:52.002
Your trial begins now.

36:58.174 --> 37:00.426
- Give him five more minutes.
- He's already had 30.

37:00.510 --> 37:01.552
I'm not missing dinner with my kids

37:01.636 --> 37:04.973
'cause the ex-football star had
better things to do. Good night, Grace.

37:06.516 --> 37:08.601
Dammit, Trevor.

37:10.270 --> 37:14.357
<i>Traveler 4022 failed to defuse the bomb</i>

37:14.440 --> 37:16.484
<i>that led to the death of his team.</i>

37:16.567 --> 37:20.405
<i>I'm sure it was a very difficult situation</i>
<i>to face alone.</i>

37:20.488 --> 37:22.240
<i>But he wasn't alone.</i>

37:22.323 --> 37:23.533
<i>No.</i>

37:23.616 --> 37:26.912
<i>You offered 4022</i>
<i>your assistance.</i>

37:26.995 --> 37:29.164
<i>Many times, but he was afraid.</i>

37:29.247 --> 37:31.666
<i>And do you think</i>
<i>this excuses his actions?</i>

37:33.960 --> 37:35.086
No, I don't.

37:37.213 --> 37:42.010
I practiced defusing that bomb
a thousand times.

37:42.093 --> 37:44.971
But when I got here, it didn't work.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.058
I swear, I tried it.

37:48.141 --> 37:50.143
The director didn't give me enough time.

37:50.226 --> 37:51.686
And what was I supposed to do?
Die?

37:51.770 --> 37:53.229
Instead, you betrayed all of us.

37:58.193 --> 37:59.861
It is now time to vote.

38:05.867 --> 38:08.453
<i>3569.</i>

38:09.745 --> 38:11.747
<i>0115.</i>

38:15.460 --> 38:17.253
<i>3326.</i>

38:18.754 --> 38:21.257
What's gonna happen to me?

38:36.606 --> 38:38.274
Traveler 4022,

38:38.358 --> 38:40.360
you have been found guilty of treason,

38:40.443 --> 38:43.321
for which the punishment
is death by immediate overwrite.

38:43.404 --> 38:46.908
No. No! No! No!

38:48.952 --> 38:52.122
<i>No! No!</i>

38:52.205 --> 38:54.374
<i>No!</i>

38:54.457 --> 38:57.335
<i>No. No!</i>

39:44.215 --> 39:47.135
Traveler 4024...

39:47.218 --> 39:49.262
welcome to the 21st century.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.026
Thank you.

40:10.992 --> 40:13.661
There, better?
Better.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.595
Yes?

40:30.678 --> 40:33.306
Carly, I was, uh...

40:33.389 --> 40:35.725
passing through the area
and wanted to drop by.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.685
Just for a moment.
I have another appointment.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.479
What's going on?
Is something wrong?

40:39.562 --> 40:42.190
I just wanted you to know
you're not alone.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.566
I'm gonna help you.

40:43.649 --> 40:46.945
I've seen this system fail women like you
too many times before,

40:47.028 --> 40:49.614
and I'd like to see this story
have a better ending.

40:49.697 --> 40:53.534
Okay. Um... thank you.

40:53.618 --> 40:56.121
The father does have a lot of leverage,

40:56.204 --> 40:59.124
so, in between now
and the next proceeding,

40:59.207 --> 41:00.791
we need to strengthen your case.

41:00.875 --> 41:04.212
Red flag number one... your liquid income.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.796
I swear to you,
I didn't make that money by--

41:05.880 --> 41:07.090
It doesn't matter.

41:07.173 --> 41:11.344
As far as I care, you did what you had to
in order to feed your child.

41:11.427 --> 41:13.846
But... the allegation was made,

41:13.929 --> 41:15.974
and so we have to combat it.

41:16.057 --> 41:17.392
How?

41:17.475 --> 41:19.519
You need to get a job.

41:21.562 --> 41:23.481
I'll help you get set up.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.691
Let's meet later this week.

41:42.625 --> 41:43.876
What's wrong?

41:43.959 --> 41:45.878
Donner got off.

41:45.961 --> 41:48.673
Out of the death penalty.
He's still gonna get life in prison.

41:48.756 --> 41:49.882
With a chance of parole.

41:49.965 --> 41:51.967
Not for a long time.

41:53.053 --> 41:55.638
He's just lucky
he killed the right people.

41:55.722 --> 41:56.848
What does that mean?

41:56.931 --> 42:00.059
Nobody cares about the deaths
of a few sex workers.

42:00.143 --> 42:02.228
They just sweep it underneath the rug.

42:03.146 --> 42:04.522
It's not right.

42:17.118 --> 42:19.662
- For Christ's sake.
- We need to talk.

42:19.745 --> 42:21.331
Didn't bring your FBI friend with you?

42:21.414 --> 42:23.374
No. Wasn't necessary.

42:24.917 --> 42:27.962
This should cover all the benefits
that I received under David's care...

42:28.046 --> 42:30.048
with interest.

42:31.757 --> 42:33.843
-Is this legal?
-Do you care?

42:33.926 --> 42:35.928
David needs to maintain his position here.

42:36.011 --> 42:37.847
He's doing a bit of work for us.

42:37.930 --> 42:39.140
That's blackmail.

42:39.890 --> 42:41.726
I could take the money back,
if you prefer,

42:41.809 --> 42:43.561
give it to your replacement.

42:45.646 --> 42:47.898
But David seems to like you.

42:53.154 --> 42:54.780
Tell him he can
come back to work on Monday.

42:57.575 --> 42:58.618
Bye, Ken.

43:09.129 --> 43:11.297
Hell of a first assignment.

43:11.381 --> 43:12.382
Well, honestly,

43:12.465 --> 43:15.593
I think even going to prison's
better than where I just came from.

43:15.676 --> 43:16.761
It's that bad?

43:17.720 --> 43:19.514
I was kind of hoping
the work we've been doing

43:19.597 --> 43:21.849
would have some effect, especially Helios.

43:21.932 --> 43:23.226
If anything, it's going the other way.

43:23.309 --> 43:25.270
Have we at least found
more fuel for the reactor?

43:26.104 --> 43:27.980
I shouldn't have said anything.

43:28.063 --> 43:29.899
Protocol 2.
You know we're not supposed to--

43:29.982 --> 43:31.526
Yeah, no, I get it.
I get it.

43:33.736 --> 43:35.488
Be strong.

44:05.185 --> 44:07.019
Rough jump into the 21st?

44:10.981 --> 44:13.193
I'm Traveler 2587.

44:14.527 --> 44:16.654
So, you're one of the director's
abandoned orphans, too?

44:16.737 --> 44:19.574
I'm on mission,
and you're breaking Protocol 2.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.909
Some mission.

44:23.244 --> 44:25.830
I trust in the grand plan.

44:25.913 --> 44:28.541
Give it some time.

44:28.624 --> 44:30.626
Then we'll talk.
