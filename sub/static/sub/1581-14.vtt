[ Angry Chittering ]

15:26.028 --> 15:28.195
Come on, Chop.
I'll give you a paint job.

15:28.197 --> 15:31.031
- The Empire won't know
the difference.
- [ Groans ]

15:31.033 --> 15:32.333
For Kanan.

15:32.335 --> 15:35.102
[ Droid Language ]

15:35.104 --> 15:38.172
[ Electricity Crackling ]
[ Kanan Screaming ]

15:38.174 --> 15:40.507
[ Screaming Continues ]

15:40.509 --> 15:42.810
The Jedi
is no good to me dead.

15:42.812 --> 15:45.179
[ Screams ]

15:45.181 --> 15:46.914
[ Groans ]

15:46.916 --> 15:50.384
His resistance
is impressive.

15:50.386 --> 15:54.421
Yes. He does possess
the will of a Jedi of old.

15:54.423 --> 15:57.124
Is it possible...

15:57.126 --> 16:01.128
he does not know
of any other rebels
to speak of?

16:01.863 --> 16:01.862
Perhaps.

16:01.864 --> 16:06.834
I recommend
we transfer him from Lothal
to another location.

16:06.836 --> 16:11.071
One that never fails
to extract a confession.

16:15.844 --> 16:18.078
- Behind you!
- Ha, I'm not gonna fall for--

16:18.080 --> 16:20.014
[ Growls ]

16:20.016 --> 16:24.251
[ Droid Language ]

16:24.253 --> 16:25.286
[ Squeals ]

16:26.154 --> 16:27.288
Ah.

16:30.992 --> 16:32.926
I know you can do this,
Chopper.

16:32.928 --> 16:34.795
[ Droid Language ]

16:37.999 --> 16:40.467
[ Electronic Muttering ]

16:40.469 --> 16:43.437
There's the courier.
Where's his escort?

16:43.439 --> 16:46.173
Not our problem.
We're running late
as it is.

16:46.175 --> 16:48.442
BN-749 to pilot.
Courier is aboard.

17:07.295 --> 17:10.297
Shuttle <i> Lagos </i> requesting
permission to dock.

17:10.299 --> 17:13.467
<i>Lagos,</i>
you are clear to proceed.

17:30.318 --> 17:32.920
[ Electronic Chittering ]

17:32.922 --> 17:35.222
Calm down, little guy.
We're not gonna hurt you.

17:35.224 --> 17:37.024
Do you have a lock
on Chopper's beacon?

17:37.026 --> 17:38.359
Looks like
he's aboard the cruiser.

17:39.327 --> 17:41.228
Come on, Chop, find Kanan.

17:42.564 --> 17:45.065
You're late, 264.
Plug in.

17:45.067 --> 17:47.034
[ Chittering ]

17:51.039 --> 17:53.607
Where's the data?
I'm not seeing it
on my monitor.

17:53.609 --> 17:56.877
[ Droid Language ]

17:56.879 --> 18:00.114
Hold it. You're not authorized
to copy communication logs.

18:00.116 --> 18:02.015
[ Droid Language ]

18:02.017 --> 18:05.386
What's the problem here?
This droid
is malfunctioning, sir.

18:06.388 --> 18:08.255
[ Beeping ]

18:08.257 --> 18:08.255
There's the signal.

18:08.257 --> 18:13.293
- He must have found something.
- Positions, everyone!
We're going in.

18:14.529 --> 18:17.131
- What about this guy?
- Take him with you.

18:17.133 --> 18:20.267
- Why me?
- Because you're intimidating.

18:21.169 --> 18:23.337
[ Chuckles ]
Can't argue with that.

18:23.339 --> 18:25.205
[ Growls ]
Come on, you.

18:25.207 --> 18:26.607
[ Electronic Chittering ]

18:27.942 --> 18:29.977
Mmm, looks like
an older model.

18:29.979 --> 18:32.212
You better check
its encryption codes.

18:32.214 --> 18:34.982
[ Explosion ]
[ Alarm Blaring ]

18:34.984 --> 18:37.084
We're under attack!

18:44.259 --> 18:47.094
Gonna make another pass.
Chopper better hurry.

18:54.602 --> 18:56.403
[ Grunts ]

18:56.405 --> 18:58.772
Zeb, I need some help!

18:58.774 --> 19:02.142
<i>Keep their cannons busy!</i>
Ah! <i> Karabast!</i>

19:02.144 --> 19:04.378
I'm the one
who needs some help.

19:04.380 --> 19:06.980
[ Droid Language ]

19:06.982 --> 19:10.384
Hey, I'm starting
to like you much better
than our regular droid.

19:10.386 --> 19:12.186
[ Chittering ]

19:12.188 --> 19:15.055
[ Alarm Blaring Continues ]

19:23.631 --> 19:26.333
[ Excited Chittering ]

19:26.335 --> 19:28.735
I see him.
Give me cover, Ezra.

19:28.737 --> 19:30.471
Okay, Chopper, hit it!

19:30.473 --> 19:32.439
[ Chittering ]

19:42.317 --> 19:45.285
[ Electronic Whooping ]

20:04.372 --> 20:07.174
That was amazing,
Chopper!
[ Chittering ]

20:07.176 --> 20:09.643
Not bad, not bad.

20:11.346 --> 20:14.047
- [ Chittering ]
- [ Droid Language ]

20:15.216 --> 20:17.184
He was actually
a big help around here...

20:17.186 --> 20:19.286
while you were off
spying.

20:19.288 --> 20:21.488
I say we keep him.

20:25.226 --> 20:27.394
[ Angry Chittering ]

20:28.630 --> 20:30.364
[ Yowls ]

20:31.466 --> 20:33.333
[ Chuckling ]

20:33.335 --> 20:36.069
I should've seen
that coming.

20:44.245 --> 20:47.047
[ Meowing ]

20:50.218 --> 20:53.487
I'm proud of you.
You stepped up
and took the lead.

20:53.489 --> 20:55.656
Kanan has taught you well.

20:55.658 --> 20:57.391
So have you.

20:57.393 --> 21:00.894
- <i> [ Electronic Chirping ]</i>
- I think we found something.

21:00.896 --> 21:04.231
Kanan is on
Governor Tarkin's Destroyer,
the <i> Sovereign.</i>

21:04.233 --> 21:08.168
It's still here
above Lothal, but it's
scheduled to leave soon.

21:08.170 --> 21:11.238
- Where to?
- The Mustafar system?

21:11.240 --> 21:13.206
I've never heard of it.
Hera?

21:13.208 --> 21:14.775
[ Sighs ]

21:14.777 --> 21:17.110
I've only heard
that name once.

21:17.112 --> 21:19.079
From Kanan.

21:19.081 --> 21:22.149
He said Mustafar
is where Jedi go to die.
