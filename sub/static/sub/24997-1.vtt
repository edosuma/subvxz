01:15.998 --> 01:17.834
Justin, let's go!

01:23.206 --> 01:25.743
Justin. Hello, Justin.

01:27.310 --> 01:29.177
Set an alarm for 11:00 p.m.

01:29.179 --> 01:31.778
and set another alarm
for 11:50 p.m.

01:38.655 --> 01:40.156
Rhi, 6:30, hon.

01:46.495 --> 01:47.561
Rhi!

01:47.563 --> 01:49.296
I'm up!

01:49.298 --> 01:50.467
Oh, my God.

02:41.149 --> 02:42.516
- Hello!
- Hi!

02:42.518 --> 02:43.598
Oh, thanks, babe.

02:44.254 --> 02:45.652
Hey...

02:45.654 --> 02:47.421
I need you to run those
errands today for me, please.

02:47.423 --> 02:49.723
I don't really know
about today.

02:49.725 --> 02:51.892
Just try. Okay, Nick?

02:51.894 --> 02:53.230
See you later.

02:53.730 --> 02:55.065
Bye.

03:04.374 --> 03:07.308
Jolene, breakfast. Come on!

03:07.310 --> 03:08.945
- No!
- We're gonna be late.

03:15.183 --> 03:16.416
God.

03:16.418 --> 03:19.854
Um... I could also drive,
if you want.

03:19.856 --> 03:22.226
I mean, I could actually
use the practice.

03:25.494 --> 03:27.594
Does that have spinach in it?

03:27.596 --> 03:30.198
Yeah, Dad says spinach
has antioxidants.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.898
Mmm. You know
what else has antioxidants?

03:31.900 --> 03:34.135
- Your balls. Yeah.
- My balls.

03:34.137 --> 03:36.271
Well, Dad says
it's important, so...

03:36.273 --> 03:38.239
Hey!

03:38.241 --> 03:39.610
What's going on up here, huh?

03:41.143 --> 03:42.479
Dumbass.

03:55.291 --> 03:56.792
Justin, my goon!

03:59.094 --> 04:01.162
Yo, don't ignore me, bro.

04:01.164 --> 04:03.167
Right, sorry. Hey, goon.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.265
You okay?

04:05.267 --> 04:07.187
Yeah, I'm good. All good.

04:07.769 --> 04:09.704
I'm so tired.

04:09.706 --> 04:11.004
I wanna drop Model UN,

04:11.006 --> 04:12.105
but if I don't get
into Stanford,

04:12.107 --> 04:14.141
I will literally cry to death.

04:14.143 --> 04:15.610
That campus is so beautiful.

04:15.612 --> 04:18.846
And their mascot is,
not even joking, a tree.

04:18.848 --> 04:20.014
You're gonna apply
with me, right?

04:20.016 --> 04:21.117
Yeah. For sure.

04:23.485 --> 04:25.087
Where even is Justin?

04:26.290 --> 04:28.355
I mean, what's up with him?

04:28.357 --> 04:29.456
He takes you
totally for granted.

04:29.458 --> 04:30.459
I'll be right back.

04:35.131 --> 04:37.098
Hey!

04:37.100 --> 04:39.466
Look, I'm sorry
for texting you so much.

04:39.468 --> 04:41.670
I was gonna text you "Sorry"
again this morning,

04:41.672 --> 04:43.571
but I'd already
texted you so much,

04:43.573 --> 04:45.740
And also, I know you don't
like it when I apologize,

04:45.742 --> 04:49.009
so I guess I'm sorry
for saying "I'm sorry."

04:49.011 --> 04:50.279
Rhiannon.

04:51.347 --> 04:52.747
- Yeah?
- Don't be sorry.

04:52.749 --> 04:55.516
That was on me.
I should've written you back.

04:55.518 --> 04:59.754
No, you don't have to text me
every time I text you.

04:59.756 --> 05:01.892
I think I do.

05:03.460 --> 05:04.759
Um...

05:04.761 --> 05:07.461
Well, I can come watch
your practice if you want.

05:07.463 --> 05:09.866
That doesn't sound
that much fun for you.

05:16.071 --> 05:18.074
Why are you
looking at me like that?

05:18.775 --> 05:19.910
Like what?

05:22.879 --> 05:24.681
What else do you have today?

05:25.381 --> 05:26.683
Other than practice?

05:27.951 --> 05:30.851
Nothing. No tests or anything.

05:30.853 --> 05:35.425
Maybe it would be fun
if we just went somewhere?

05:36.425 --> 05:37.624
Like, after school?

05:37.626 --> 05:39.929
Or even now?

05:41.530 --> 05:43.066
Is that something we do?

05:44.232 --> 05:46.937
Well, couldn't it be?

06:06.956 --> 06:08.288
<i>He's an outstanding player.</i>

06:08.290 --> 06:10.223
<i>He's young,
he has an ERA of 1.68.</i>

06:10.225 --> 06:12.360
<i>He's not that
young! Twenty-three! He's...</i>

06:12.362 --> 06:13.461
<i>Twenty-three years old!</i>

06:13.463 --> 06:14.595
This what you wanna listen to?

06:14.597 --> 06:15.997
- Yeah.
- <i>I mean, look at his record.</i>

06:15.999 --> 06:17.464
<i>He got eighteen wins...</i>

06:17.466 --> 06:18.966
How about you
throw on some music?

06:18.968 --> 06:20.567
<i>What are you talking about?
They're gonna dump him?</i>

06:20.569 --> 06:23.838
<i>Eighteen wins
against substandard teams...</i>

06:31.646 --> 06:34.447
<i>♪ All the money in the world</i>

06:34.449 --> 06:38.285
<i>♪ Couldn't buy back those days</i>

06:38.287 --> 06:40.588
<i>- ♪ You pull back
- ♪ You pull back the curtain</i>

06:40.590 --> 06:42.956
<i>♪ And the sun burns
into your eyes</i>

06:42.958 --> 06:44.292
You know this song?

06:44.294 --> 06:45.459
How did I not know that?

06:45.461 --> 06:47.761
<i>♪ You watch a plane flying</i>

06:47.763 --> 06:51.966
<i>♪ Across the clear blue sky</i>

06:51.968 --> 06:54.768
<i>♪ This is the day</i>

06:54.770 --> 06:57.574
<i>♪ Your life will surely change</i>

06:58.740 --> 07:01.274
<i>♪ This is the day</i>

07:01.276 --> 07:04.680
<i>♪ When things fall into place</i>

08:01.937 --> 08:03.272
Saved your life!
Saved your life!

08:05.574 --> 08:06.909
All right, come on!

08:16.384 --> 08:17.386
Hi.

08:28.530 --> 08:31.499
"You have a nice smile."

08:31.501 --> 08:34.134
Story checks out.
Good job, cookie.

08:34.135 --> 08:36.739
Bad job, cookie.
It's not a fortune.

08:37.438 --> 08:38.840
It's not?

08:38.842 --> 08:41.142
No. A fortune would be,
"You will have a nice smile."

08:41.144 --> 08:44.546
Because a fortune is supposed
to tell you the future.

08:44.548 --> 08:46.847
Or something
you don't already know.

08:46.849 --> 08:49.316
Like that you have
a nice smile.

08:53.689 --> 08:54.754
Um...

08:54.756 --> 08:56.924
It's just Dad.

08:58.761 --> 09:00.230
You don't talk about him.

09:02.064 --> 09:03.400
Like, ever.

09:03.967 --> 09:05.999
Um...

09:06.001 --> 09:09.573
He had a manic episode
a few years ago.

09:10.405 --> 09:11.641
It's no big deal.

09:12.775 --> 09:14.110
I had no idea.

09:16.179 --> 09:19.647
Yeah, I haven't really
told anyone about it.

09:19.649 --> 09:21.349
Not even Rebecca.

09:21.351 --> 09:23.420
You don't have to, obviously.

09:25.155 --> 09:27.756
Sometimes I want to.
It's just...

09:29.125 --> 09:30.323
I don't know.

09:30.325 --> 09:32.161
Well, what happened, exactly?

09:34.564 --> 09:35.929
He came home one day

09:35.931 --> 09:39.366
and told us he got
a big promotion.

09:39.368 --> 09:42.769
He took us out to some French
restaurant to celebrate.

09:42.771 --> 09:44.140
And then we went to a movie.

09:46.208 --> 09:49.110
He paid the guy
some crazy amount

09:49.112 --> 09:51.280
so we could have the whole
theater to ourselves.

09:52.314 --> 09:54.648
I'm guessing no promotion?

09:54.650 --> 09:57.487
No. He had actually
just gotten laid off

09:58.655 --> 10:00.187
and snapped.

10:00.189 --> 10:01.956
So, no new rich life.

10:01.958 --> 10:04.091
And my mom
had to take a second job

10:04.093 --> 10:05.862
and we almost lost our house.

10:06.828 --> 10:08.328
And now even if he could work,

10:08.330 --> 10:09.830
I don't know
who would hire him.

10:09.832 --> 10:13.770
He just sits around
and makes paintings of faces.

10:15.771 --> 10:19.008
Sometimes people need a break.

10:20.175 --> 10:21.877
Life gets too much.

10:24.313 --> 10:28.018
It sounds like you resent him
for checking out, though.

10:38.493 --> 10:42.129
I want to talk to him
about that day and why,

10:42.131 --> 10:45.135
but I can never seem
to figure out what to say.

10:46.835 --> 10:48.704
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

10:49.671 --> 10:50.906
I'm glad you did.

10:53.376 --> 10:54.678
It feels good.

11:09.458 --> 11:11.761
It's your turn. Go.

11:12.429 --> 11:13.860
Uh...

11:13.862 --> 11:16.697
Yeah, I mean,
I hate French food, too.

11:16.699 --> 11:18.865
Snails and croissants.

11:18.867 --> 11:21.235
Snail-croissants.
I mean, what's that about?

11:21.237 --> 11:23.740
- I meant, open your cookie.
- Oh.

11:51.567 --> 11:52.969
See you tomorrow.

11:55.036 --> 11:56.604
What's wrong?

11:56.606 --> 11:58.639
You know every day
won't be like this, right?

11:58.641 --> 12:00.273
I know.

12:00.275 --> 12:01.341
But, maybe,
it helps you remember

12:01.343 --> 12:03.479
you like spending
time with me?

12:06.583 --> 12:09.048
Look, I just mean, today...

12:09.050 --> 12:12.521
Today was the happiest day
I've had in a long time.

12:14.256 --> 12:15.891
Tomorrow is tomorrow.

12:17.827 --> 12:20.096
Let's end today
on a nice note.

12:24.666 --> 12:25.668
Okay.

12:33.541 --> 12:35.110
That's the nice note.

12:37.847 --> 12:39.879
Also, your mouth
tastes so much better

12:39.881 --> 12:41.948
when you don't smoke.

12:41.950 --> 12:43.118
I'll try to remember that.

13:09.279 --> 13:10.845
Set an alarm for 11:00 p.m.

13:10.847 --> 13:12.816
and set another alarm
for 11:50 p.m.

13:19.021 --> 13:20.457
Hello, Amy.

13:30.232 --> 13:31.701
Hey, what's going on?

13:33.669 --> 13:35.536
Excuse me.

13:35.538 --> 13:38.071
My family just moved
here from DC.

13:38.073 --> 13:40.039
My mom told me to shadow
someone at the school today,

13:40.041 --> 13:42.844
but she didn't
set anything up.

13:42.846 --> 13:45.578
So embarrassing.
Could I shadow you?

13:45.580 --> 13:47.149
Um...

13:48.718 --> 13:50.853
I don't know what that is, no.
What is that?

13:52.387 --> 13:53.622
Yeah, sure.

13:58.194 --> 14:00.360
Rebecca, Alexander,
this is Amy,

14:00.362 --> 14:01.762
who might be coming here.

14:01.764 --> 14:04.163
Hey, Amy. You've got a great
person to show you around.

14:04.165 --> 14:06.366
Yeah, Alexander's a huge fan.

14:06.368 --> 14:07.900
Okay, all I meant was Rhiannon

14:07.902 --> 14:09.068
is super generous
with her time.

14:09.070 --> 14:10.471
Yeah, you wish!

14:10.473 --> 14:12.105
Don't worry, we're friends.
He likes when I tease him.

14:12.107 --> 14:13.441
How about we get back
to the lab now?

14:13.443 --> 14:14.644
Hey, Justin!

14:15.243 --> 14:16.278
Justin!

14:19.348 --> 14:22.648
Coach is pissed off at me
for blowing off practice.

14:22.650 --> 14:24.284
Uh... Amy,
this is my boyfriend, Justin.

14:24.286 --> 14:25.754
Did we drink yesterday?

14:26.188 --> 14:27.788
No, why?

14:27.790 --> 14:31.225
We just left school and went
to Baltimore yesterday.

14:31.227 --> 14:33.393
Just out of the blue.
It was amazing.

14:33.395 --> 14:34.595
Yeah, I'll take
your word for it

14:34.597 --> 14:36.197
'cause I can't remember
a thing about it.

14:36.931 --> 14:38.097
What part?

14:38.099 --> 14:39.533
Pretty much the whole day.

14:39.535 --> 14:41.668
It's super foggy,

14:41.670 --> 14:43.137
like I'm hungover
or something.

14:43.139 --> 14:44.238
Now I've to make up work

14:44.240 --> 14:45.639
in three stupid classes
by tomorrow,

14:45.641 --> 14:47.674
but I have a shift
till 10:00 tonight.

14:47.676 --> 14:50.677
So my life basically
sucks right now.

14:50.679 --> 14:52.913
Okay, so you had
an amazing day

14:52.915 --> 14:55.248
with your gorgeous,
incredible girlfriend.

14:55.250 --> 14:56.419
And to you that sucks?

14:58.020 --> 15:00.654
I'm sorry. Who is this
and what is her deal?

15:00.656 --> 15:01.822
Who are you?

15:01.824 --> 15:02.923
Why are you
bitching and moaning

15:02.925 --> 15:04.023
about the only
good thing in your life?

15:04.025 --> 15:05.027
Amy!

15:05.928 --> 15:07.628
Chill, it's fine.

15:07.630 --> 15:09.929
Okay, great talk. Gotta go.

15:09.931 --> 15:12.134
Rhi, don't forget about
Steve's party on Saturday.

15:15.404 --> 15:16.671
I'm sorry.

15:16.673 --> 15:19.038
I'm just allergic to
unappreciative dicks.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.042
That's not who he is.

15:21.309 --> 15:22.311
You deserve better.

15:26.781 --> 15:29.316
I'm sorry.
It was in your face.

15:29.318 --> 15:31.684
It's okay. I'm okay.

15:31.686 --> 15:34.355
You're very sweet.

15:34.357 --> 15:36.322
But actually,
I'm not feeling great.

15:36.324 --> 15:37.490
Alexander, would you mind

15:37.492 --> 15:38.993
taking Amy for the rest
of the day?

15:38.995 --> 15:40.594
Sure.

15:40.596 --> 15:41.698
Thank you.

15:47.435 --> 15:49.435
I'm gonna need you to
ghostwrite some texts for me.

15:50.705 --> 15:52.673
First, text Abby.

15:52.675 --> 15:54.508
Just a bunch of tree emojis.

15:54.510 --> 15:55.676
And then, second,

15:55.678 --> 15:58.445
text Will something
cute but mean.

15:58.447 --> 16:01.014
Like, over-the-top mean,
but, like, still cute.

16:01.016 --> 16:03.051
Can't it just wait
until we get home?

16:04.085 --> 16:05.986
No, why?

16:05.988 --> 16:08.023
It's just stuff with Justin.

16:09.659 --> 16:11.361
Is this stuff
that he's a douchebag?

16:12.261 --> 16:13.860
All right, look.

16:13.862 --> 16:17.567
You have two options.
One, break up with him!

16:18.700 --> 16:21.201
And, two, cheat, like, a lot.

16:21.203 --> 16:23.470
Crazy amounts.
With crazy amounts of dudes.

16:23.472 --> 16:25.107
You know,
like how Lindsey does?

16:26.909 --> 16:28.278
Mom doesn't cheat.

16:32.482 --> 16:33.846
I don't wanna
talk about it anymore.

16:33.848 --> 16:35.184
All right. Great.

17:04.313 --> 17:06.546
Set an alarm for 11:00 p.m.

17:06.548 --> 17:09.585
and another alarm
for 11:50 p.m.

17:10.286 --> 17:11.287
Okay.

17:14.521 --> 17:16.521
- You sure you don't mind?
- No, of course not.

17:16.523 --> 17:18.557
Thanks, babe. I just need
to get super wasted tonight.

17:18.559 --> 17:19.992
- Yup.
- Steve, my goon!

17:19.993 --> 17:22.429
- My goon!
- What's up, man?

17:22.431 --> 17:23.998
Hey, Stephanie.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.700
Rhiannon.

17:25.702 --> 17:28.634
Hey, guys. What's going on?

17:44.486 --> 17:46.254
- Hey!
- Hi!

17:46.989 --> 17:48.154
Justin's over there.

17:48.156 --> 17:49.358
Thank you.

17:52.461 --> 17:54.161
Bro...

17:54.163 --> 17:55.665
That's so weak.

17:59.735 --> 18:00.837
Shoot it!

18:02.203 --> 18:04.173
- Oh!
- Hey!

18:23.326 --> 18:24.559
Oh!

18:55.223 --> 18:57.024

19:51.012 --> 19:54.381
I don't think I know you.
Do you go to Octavian?

19:54.383 --> 19:58.785
No, I'm Nathan.
Steve's cousin.

19:58.787 --> 20:00.123
I'm Rhiannon.

20:01.255 --> 20:03.624
That's a lovely name.

20:03.626 --> 20:05.659
Oh, thank you.

20:05.661 --> 20:06.762
I don't like it.

20:07.261 --> 20:08.429
Why?

20:08.431 --> 20:10.730
Well, everyone thinks
it's Rihanna,

20:10.732 --> 20:12.965
as in,
"Bitch Better Have My Money".

20:12.967 --> 20:14.800
Also, no one can spell it.

20:14.802 --> 20:17.304
That's their problem.
It's a beautiful name.

20:17.306 --> 20:18.739
Thank you.

20:18.741 --> 20:22.142
Yo! Hey! Who's this?

20:22.144 --> 20:23.679
This is Nathan,
Steve's cousin.

20:24.445 --> 20:25.612
Hey.

20:25.614 --> 20:28.647
Steve's gay cousin.

20:28.649 --> 20:30.349
All right. Hey.

20:30.351 --> 20:33.288
You got nothing
to worry about, Galahad.

20:34.690 --> 20:35.922
But your girlfriend might.

20:35.924 --> 20:37.292
Uh...

20:38.793 --> 20:40.295
Thanks, I guess.

20:41.262 --> 20:43.064
I'm gonna be upstairs.

20:43.999 --> 20:45.101
Yo!

20:50.473 --> 20:54.240
You wanna go someplace
not upstairs?

21:06.722 --> 21:08.257
Your boyfriend,

21:09.124 --> 21:11.624
not a dancer?

21:11.626 --> 21:13.159
Um...

21:13.161 --> 21:15.464
Not today, apparently.

21:18.134 --> 21:19.135
So...

21:19.867 --> 21:21.537
Why are you with him?

21:23.638 --> 21:24.639
Um...

21:25.741 --> 21:28.211
Because we love each other.

21:29.511 --> 21:31.847
Sometimes,
it's really good with him.

21:35.282 --> 21:37.453
I mean, he's my type.

21:38.287 --> 21:40.223
Ah, okay.

21:41.190 --> 21:42.325
And...

21:43.291 --> 21:44.292
What's your type?

21:44.894 --> 21:45.995
Um...

21:46.896 --> 21:51.166
Tall, slim, nice shoulders.

21:54.002 --> 21:55.469
What?

21:55.471 --> 21:56.869
What's wrong
with nice shoulders?

21:56.871 --> 21:59.506
No, nothing.

21:59.508 --> 22:03.143
I don't know, I guess I'm just
more of a butt guy myself.

22:03.145 --> 22:05.578
But, you know, I get it.

22:05.580 --> 22:07.146
I guess when
you've seen as many...

22:07.148 --> 22:08.582
Seen as many butts?

22:08.584 --> 22:10.419
No, no.

22:13.088 --> 22:14.721
Real talk?

22:14.723 --> 22:17.257
Not a fan of some dude
mackin' on my girlfriend.

22:17.259 --> 22:18.557
Don't care if he's gay.

22:18.559 --> 22:20.527
Real talk.

22:20.529 --> 22:22.732
You gotta get your cousin
Nathan in line.

22:25.701 --> 22:27.200
He is gay, right?

22:27.202 --> 22:28.771
Bro, what cousin?

22:39.080 --> 22:40.713
I just know that
you can be attracted

22:40.715 --> 22:42.417
to way more people
than you think.

22:43.551 --> 22:44.552
Me?

22:45.253 --> 22:46.454
Anyone.

22:49.191 --> 22:50.393
How do you know?

22:54.229 --> 22:56.128
I'm sorry, I have to go.

22:56.130 --> 22:57.364
Oh! We're not done here.

22:57.366 --> 22:59.967
I'll call myself
so that I have your number.

22:59.969 --> 23:01.567
You don't want this number.

23:01.569 --> 23:03.603
I'm gonna get a new
number tomorrow.

23:03.605 --> 23:05.204
- You're getting a new number?
- There he is!

23:05.206 --> 23:06.272
Rhi! That's not
Steve's cousin!

23:06.274 --> 23:07.373
I don't even think he's gay!

23:07.375 --> 23:08.909
- What?
- I'm sorry, I have to go.

23:08.911 --> 23:10.442
- I'll explain later. Promise.
- What?

23:10.444 --> 23:11.979
Where are you going?

23:11.981 --> 23:12.982
Go, go, go!

23:15.783 --> 23:17.416
Oh, hell no!

23:17.418 --> 23:18.584
Wait, you guys!

23:18.586 --> 23:19.787
Come on, come on!

23:19.789 --> 23:21.089
Leave him alone!

23:22.156 --> 23:23.655
Don't creep on our women,
little dude!

23:23.657 --> 23:24.859
Rhi, give me my keys!

23:25.924 --> 23:26.970
No, Justin, you can't!

23:26.994 --> 23:28.461
- Justin!
- My keys!

23:28.463 --> 23:30.463
No,
you cannot drive right now.

23:30.465 --> 23:32.167
Who even was that?

23:53.021 --> 23:55.657
Siri. Hey, Siri!

23:56.492 --> 23:58.157
Do I have a phone?

23:58.159 --> 24:00.862
<i>It is 6:29 a.m.</i>

24:17.378 --> 24:19.645
<i>This teenager missed curfew,</i>

24:19.647 --> 24:22.048
<i>then said the Devil
made him do it.</i>

24:22.050 --> 24:24.217
<i>Monroeville's Nathan Daldry,
was found</i>

24:24.219 --> 24:26.486
<i>asleep around 1:00,
Saturday morning,</i>

24:26.488 --> 24:29.622
<i>by the side of a highway
with a broken back windshield.</i>

24:29.624 --> 24:31.191
<i>His explanation...</i>

24:31.193 --> 24:32.625
<i>He had been
possessed by Satan.</i>

24:32.627 --> 24:33.894
Your boy took down
his social media.

24:33.896 --> 24:34.994
<i>So tell us what happened.</i>

24:34.996 --> 24:36.061
Guess I gotta
talk to him in person.

24:36.063 --> 24:38.263
Justin, what are you thinking?

24:38.265 --> 24:39.798
Leave him alone.
He's disturbed.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.070
Then why were you even
hanging out with him?

24:43.338 --> 24:44.737
I don't know.

24:44.739 --> 24:46.019
<i>And one day,
I was fine.</i>

24:47.076 --> 24:49.910
So, Friday night
he was super weird.

24:49.912 --> 24:51.010
And then, this morning,

24:51.012 --> 24:52.814
I get a text from
a random number.

24:53.848 --> 24:54.914
"If you meet me in person,

24:54.916 --> 24:57.182
somewhere public,
I can explain.

24:57.184 --> 24:58.718
Please come alone."

24:58.720 --> 25:00.287
Oh, my God. Are you going to?

25:00.289 --> 25:02.188
I don't know, should I?

25:02.190 --> 25:03.390
I think you have to.

25:03.392 --> 25:04.490
This is the coolest,
creepiest thing

25:04.492 --> 25:06.060
that has ever happened.

25:34.990 --> 25:36.692
Tell me you're alone.
You're alone, right?

25:37.892 --> 25:39.925
I'm sorry, do I know you?

25:39.927 --> 25:41.629
Oh, Nathan sent me.

25:43.698 --> 25:44.899
Oh, um...

25:45.434 --> 25:47.532
Where is Nathan?

25:47.534 --> 25:49.134
He's here.

25:49.136 --> 25:51.336
In a way. I mean, he's not,
like, "here" here,

25:51.338 --> 25:53.006
but he also wasn't there
on Friday when you met him.

25:53.008 --> 25:54.443
Or you thought
that you met him.

25:55.444 --> 25:56.744
You know, you actually didn't.

25:57.178 --> 25:58.413
What?

25:59.013 --> 26:00.946
Today I'm Megan.

26:00.948 --> 26:04.150
The day that you met Nathan,
I was Nathan. All right?

26:04.152 --> 26:06.486
And the day that Amy shadowed
you at school, I was Amy.

26:06.488 --> 26:09.158
And the day that you went
to the beach with Justin...

26:10.291 --> 26:11.827
I was Justin.

26:12.927 --> 26:15.894
Because I am someone
who wakes up

26:15.896 --> 26:17.599
in a different body every day.

26:19.734 --> 26:23.036
Always someone my age.
Never too far from the last,

26:23.038 --> 26:25.838
never the same person twice,

26:25.840 --> 26:29.509
and I have absolutely
no control over any of it.

26:29.511 --> 26:32.011
Okay, did Rebecca
tell you I'd be here?

26:32.013 --> 26:33.945
She wasn't supposed
to tell anyone.

26:33.947 --> 26:35.915
I don't know why it happens,
I don't know how.

26:35.917 --> 26:37.083
I mean, this is...

26:37.085 --> 26:38.317
No one's ever tried
to explain it to me.

26:38.319 --> 26:40.452
And this is the first time
I've ever actually

26:40.454 --> 26:41.756
told anyone about it.

26:43.625 --> 26:45.761
And I know
I'm not doing a good job.

26:49.364 --> 26:51.333
Okay. Um...

26:52.767 --> 26:57.336
Thank you.
This is all very good,

26:57.338 --> 26:59.174
but I think I should go.

27:01.976 --> 27:03.776
"You have a nice smile."

27:03.778 --> 27:06.112
That was the fortune
that you got.

27:06.114 --> 27:08.214
The fortune that we both got.

27:08.216 --> 27:10.048
You told me about the day
that your dad got laid off.

27:10.050 --> 27:11.317
You told me about
the French restaurant.

27:11.319 --> 27:12.952
Okay, just stop.

27:12.954 --> 27:14.887
I told Justin those things,
not you.

27:14.889 --> 27:17.057
He has nothing
to do with this.

27:17.059 --> 27:18.824
He's the only one who does.

27:18.826 --> 27:20.692
I spent the day with him.

27:20.694 --> 27:24.230
And now he and you and Nathan,
and God knows who else

27:24.232 --> 27:25.565
are playing some stupid joke.

27:25.567 --> 27:28.067
And, honestly,
I don't even want to know why.

27:28.069 --> 27:29.402
So just, please, stop.

27:29.404 --> 27:31.440
He doesn't talk to you
like this.

27:32.540 --> 27:34.039
He doesn't spend days with you

27:34.041 --> 27:35.601
like the one that
we had together, okay?

27:36.544 --> 27:38.046
He doesn't see you.

27:43.018 --> 27:46.722
You have to know
that that wasn't him.

27:50.091 --> 27:51.694
It's not possible.

27:52.360 --> 27:53.462
It is.

28:08.643 --> 28:10.276
Hey.

28:10.278 --> 28:11.845
Hey! I'm all right.

28:11.847 --> 28:14.383
I seem not all right to you?
I'm fine.

28:15.050 --> 28:16.649
Great.

28:16.651 --> 28:19.951
Do you wanna study at my place
after school?

28:19.953 --> 28:21.757
- "Study."
- Who's Megan?

28:22.723 --> 28:23.759
I don't know any Megan.

28:24.492 --> 28:26.660
Did you tell anyone

28:26.662 --> 28:29.865
about what I told you about
what happened with my dad?

28:30.299 --> 28:31.730
Um...

28:31.732 --> 28:33.231
Honestly, I don't
even remember

28:33.233 --> 28:35.436
what you told me
about your dad.

28:45.413 --> 28:48.584
What's wrong with you?
Are we hanging out or what?

28:52.588 --> 28:53.922
Whatever.

29:21.950 --> 29:24.349
Hey! It's me, A.

29:24.351 --> 29:25.719
Oh.

29:25.721 --> 29:26.722
Hi. Um...

29:29.491 --> 29:30.655
Wait, "A"?

29:30.657 --> 29:33.026
He's James, but I'm A.

29:33.028 --> 29:36.829
Like, just A, like the letter.

29:36.831 --> 29:39.635
I'm still not convinced
that this is real.

29:41.703 --> 29:43.836
Who named you A?

29:43.838 --> 29:48.674
I did. I wanted a name that no
one else was likely to have.

29:48.676 --> 29:51.711
Okay, the day you were Justin,
what was I wearing?

29:51.713 --> 29:54.049
Peasant blouse, jean shorts.

29:55.384 --> 29:56.548
What?

29:56.550 --> 29:58.217
You know what
a peasant blouse is?

29:58.219 --> 30:00.385
Half the time
I wake up as a girl.

30:00.387 --> 30:02.455
Although, I will say,
I think that James

30:02.457 --> 30:04.758
could totally pull it off.
I think...

30:04.760 --> 30:06.759
Got the physique for it,
all that good stuff.

30:06.761 --> 30:07.995
Okay.

30:10.065 --> 30:12.499
What was the last thing
I said to you that day?

30:12.501 --> 30:13.865
"Your mouth tastes
so much better

30:13.867 --> 30:14.933
when you don't smoke."

30:14.935 --> 30:16.035
And the name
you called Justin

30:16.037 --> 30:17.770
to his face when
you were Nathan?

30:17.772 --> 30:20.041
What? Oh, Galahad.

30:20.742 --> 30:21.840
And when you were Amy,

30:21.842 --> 30:23.308
who showed you around
after I did?

30:23.310 --> 30:24.545
Alexander.

30:27.382 --> 30:29.147
You still could be a liar.

30:29.149 --> 30:31.384
Just a ridiculously
well-prepared liar.

30:31.386 --> 30:33.086
Or I could be
telling you the truth.

30:33.088 --> 30:35.188
Or I could be going insane.

30:35.190 --> 30:37.890
Who are you?
Who are your parents?

30:37.892 --> 30:39.895
Do they switch
bodies every day?

30:40.895 --> 30:42.028
Hey, do you mind if we go

30:42.030 --> 30:43.762
somewhere a little
more private?

30:43.764 --> 30:46.499
Okay, maybe if you were
a petite cheerleader again.

30:46.501 --> 30:48.267
But I'm not sure
you fully realize this.

30:48.269 --> 30:49.434
You're a big,
threatening dude today,

30:49.436 --> 30:51.503
so, absolutely not.

30:51.505 --> 30:54.075
Right.
I get it.

30:55.876 --> 30:57.743
I don't know
if I have parents.

30:57.745 --> 30:58.810
Um...

30:58.812 --> 31:03.082
I assume so,
but I have no one to ask.

31:03.084 --> 31:06.184
So, every day of your life,
you've just woken up, and...

31:06.186 --> 31:09.454
Just tried to live that day
for that person.

31:09.456 --> 31:14.126
Not mess anything up for them,
make no mark, leave no trace.

31:14.128 --> 31:15.994
And you're never
that person again?

31:15.996 --> 31:18.798
No. I might see them
at school

31:18.800 --> 31:22.937
a week or a month later.
If I'm in the same area.

31:25.406 --> 31:28.274
So, like,
when you're somebody,

31:28.276 --> 31:30.943
are you them or still you?

31:30.945 --> 31:32.111
I'm me.

31:32.113 --> 31:35.381
You know, my consciousness,
my memories.

31:35.383 --> 31:37.383
But then I can also access

31:37.385 --> 31:39.218
their history
and their memories.

31:39.220 --> 31:41.621
But not all at once.

31:41.623 --> 31:44.024
The longer I'm in
someone that day,

31:44.026 --> 31:45.561
the more I know about them.

31:48.563 --> 31:49.961
Who else have you told this?

31:49.963 --> 31:52.932
I told you, no one else.

31:52.934 --> 31:54.970
That sounds really lonely.

31:57.638 --> 31:58.639
Can be.

31:59.473 --> 32:00.608
And sad.

32:02.511 --> 32:04.477
But it isn't

32:04.479 --> 32:08.482
because I've seen so much.

32:09.885 --> 32:13.118
I know what makes
each person different,

32:13.120 --> 32:15.020
and what makes everyone
the same, you know?

32:15.022 --> 32:17.757
I've seen the same
color blue

32:17.759 --> 32:21.128
look 50 different ways with
50 different pairs of eyes.

32:23.164 --> 32:24.297
But you never get to stay

32:24.299 --> 32:26.434
with anything long enough
to watch it grow.

32:28.435 --> 32:29.605
It's true.

32:31.306 --> 32:34.309
But I'd like to, though.

32:38.613 --> 32:40.180
If I show you something,

32:40.182 --> 32:42.084
will you promise
to show no one else?

32:45.153 --> 32:46.188
Check out my Instagram.

32:53.561 --> 32:56.496
I've posted pictures
any days that I could.

32:56.498 --> 33:00.266
Of people I've been,
and the things that I've seen.

33:00.268 --> 33:01.534
Of course it's a risk.

33:01.536 --> 33:03.469
I have to scrub
the login information

33:03.471 --> 33:05.503
every night
before I go to bed

33:05.505 --> 33:08.175
but it's good
to have a record.

33:15.116 --> 33:17.251
This still doesn't
prove anything.

33:18.520 --> 33:20.953
I mean, you could
just be getting these

33:20.955 --> 33:23.388
from other people
or the Internet.

33:23.390 --> 33:26.759
I could, but I'm not.
Wait, wait.

33:26.761 --> 33:28.763
Can we please meet again?

33:30.397 --> 33:33.301
I don't know. Yes, maybe.

33:35.103 --> 33:38.704
Just let me process this
for a little while, okay?

33:38.706 --> 33:40.038
Okay.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.510
Bye, A.

33:42.609 --> 33:44.212
Bye.

34:31.458 --> 34:32.893
Did you need me?

34:35.429 --> 34:36.431
No.

34:37.264 --> 34:38.367
I'm good.

35:05.093 --> 35:06.094
Hey!

35:08.463 --> 35:09.497
It's me.

35:10.564 --> 35:11.830
Remember?

35:11.832 --> 35:13.832
Yet another person
has the unique idea

35:13.834 --> 35:15.868
to prank me by pretending
to be the Devil.

35:15.870 --> 35:16.872
What?

35:19.006 --> 35:20.341
No, no.

35:22.243 --> 35:25.147
I'm hoping to write something
for my school newspaper.

35:28.348 --> 35:29.718
Actually, I do recognize you.

35:30.484 --> 35:31.486
You do?

35:33.421 --> 35:35.221
I'll meet with anyone
interested in the truth.

35:36.024 --> 35:37.723
Okay.

35:37.725 --> 35:39.859
See, he did something
to my memory

35:39.861 --> 35:41.963
so the whole night's
kind of hazy.

35:42.564 --> 35:43.665
But...

35:46.033 --> 35:48.169
I remember dancing.

35:48.970 --> 35:50.736
Then,

35:50.738 --> 35:53.508
I was in this unnaturally
tiny house.

35:54.408 --> 35:56.877
Then running for my life.

35:57.678 --> 35:59.044
Apparently, that evening,

35:59.046 --> 36:01.379
I told my mom that
he needed to borrow a car

36:01.381 --> 36:02.448
so I could go help
some friends

36:02.450 --> 36:04.549
write a musical about Jesus.

36:04.551 --> 36:06.720
And this should go
in your story.

36:07.388 --> 36:08.921
When he was within me

36:08.923 --> 36:11.225
he used my phone to access
his Instagram account.

36:13.727 --> 36:15.563
I was on Satan's social media.

36:16.863 --> 36:19.834
It was intense.

36:21.303 --> 36:23.401
It was a record
of all the other teenagers

36:23.403 --> 36:24.839
that he's taken over.

36:25.740 --> 36:27.473
Can I see?

36:27.475 --> 36:29.408
He kicked me off
and changed the password

36:29.410 --> 36:32.044
before I could save
any of the photos

36:32.046 --> 36:33.548
but I recognize you.

36:34.115 --> 36:35.548
What do you mean?

36:35.550 --> 36:38.084
From one of the photos.
In the aquarium.

36:38.086 --> 36:39.321
That was you.

36:41.321 --> 36:42.656
He possessed you, too,
didn't he?

36:43.790 --> 36:45.323
No.

36:45.325 --> 36:47.428
No, I wasn't possessed.

36:49.196 --> 36:54.133
When he was within you,
did he talk to you?

36:54.135 --> 36:55.567
I think that's
enough for today.

36:55.569 --> 36:57.336
Did you get a sense
of what he was like?

36:57.338 --> 36:59.471
Like, his personality?

36:59.473 --> 37:02.475
I know his personality.

37:02.477 --> 37:04.679
It's pure evil. He's Satan.

37:05.278 --> 37:06.514
Thank you.

37:13.354 --> 37:14.654
Justin, you cannot
threaten him!

37:14.656 --> 37:16.122
It's not a threat.

37:16.124 --> 37:17.455
I'm just gonna tell him,

37:17.457 --> 37:19.058
"Little dude, next time
you talk to my girlfriend

37:19.060 --> 37:20.125
I'mma help you out

37:20.127 --> 37:21.894
by beating the Devil
out of you."

37:21.896 --> 37:23.229
How is that a threat?

37:23.231 --> 37:24.696
Justin, that's the literal
definition of a threat.

37:24.698 --> 37:26.098
Rhiannon, tell him.

37:26.100 --> 37:28.600
Rhiannon, tell her.
No. Are you a dictionary?

37:28.602 --> 37:30.435
Are you a child?

37:30.437 --> 37:31.606
I'm not a child.

37:38.979 --> 37:39.981
Hey!

37:42.816 --> 37:44.452
How did you know it was me?

37:45.553 --> 37:47.955
Just the way you looked at me.

37:49.256 --> 37:50.990
Also, she doesn't go here.

37:50.992 --> 37:52.691
He doesn't go here.

37:52.693 --> 37:55.794
You're not very good
for his attendance record.

37:55.796 --> 37:58.430
I'm not good for anyone's
attendance record.

38:03.504 --> 38:04.539
Come on.

38:05.906 --> 38:07.071
Look, I thought you said

38:07.073 --> 38:08.439
you didn't wanna mess
anyone's life up.

38:08.441 --> 38:11.042
Speaking of which,
what happened to Nathan?

38:11.044 --> 38:12.377
I had to see you.

38:12.379 --> 38:15.480
I tried to get him home,
put him to bed

38:15.482 --> 38:18.216
but at 11:59, I pulled over
and passed out

38:18.218 --> 38:19.651
except I screwed up

38:19.653 --> 38:21.354
and forgot to erase
my Instagram info.

38:21.356 --> 38:22.453
He thinks you're the Devil.

38:23.557 --> 38:24.656
If I'm the Devil,

38:24.658 --> 38:26.158
humanity has nothing
to worry about.

38:26.160 --> 38:28.526
That's exactly what the Devil
would want humanity to think.

38:28.528 --> 38:32.730
I can't win with you
suspicious mortals, can I?

38:32.732 --> 38:35.870
Seriously,
why are you doing this?

38:36.771 --> 38:37.935
The day we met,

38:37.937 --> 38:40.740
I felt something
I've never felt before.

38:40.742 --> 38:42.510
And I don't wanna let that go.

38:44.611 --> 38:48.180
About that day,
how is it okay, what you did?

38:48.182 --> 38:50.549
I let you kiss me because
I thought you were Justin.

38:50.551 --> 38:52.517
I told you something
incredibly personal

38:52.519 --> 38:53.685
because I thought
you were Justin.

38:53.687 --> 38:55.020
He never would've understood.

38:55.022 --> 38:56.923
I was in his mind, Rhiannon.
I know him.

38:56.925 --> 38:58.256
Are you serious?

38:58.258 --> 39:00.558
I know him better than you do.
He is my boyfriend.

39:00.560 --> 39:01.894
You know you shouldn't
be with him.

39:01.896 --> 39:04.430
Who should I be with, then?
You?

39:04.432 --> 39:07.499
I mean, off the top
of my head, that's an option.

39:07.501 --> 39:08.700
This isn't funny, A.

39:08.702 --> 39:11.405
This is so weird.
I mean, today you're...

39:13.173 --> 39:16.709
Not everyone's body
aligns with their mind.

39:16.711 --> 39:19.944
But I'm not asking you to give
Vic a chance, Rhiannon,

39:19.946 --> 39:22.082
I'm asking you
to give me a chance.

39:34.294 --> 39:36.798
What do you remember
from that day at the beach?

39:38.566 --> 39:39.665
Um...

39:39.667 --> 39:40.902
That it was super good?

39:42.635 --> 39:46.540
I also remember this.

39:48.008 --> 39:49.910
Can I ask you something else?

39:51.479 --> 39:52.944
Yeah.

39:52.946 --> 39:55.383
What do you like about us?

39:57.618 --> 39:58.785
Us?

39:58.787 --> 40:00.922
Yeah, like, our connection.

40:03.390 --> 40:04.392
Uh...

40:05.392 --> 40:07.560
Um...

40:07.562 --> 40:10.595
We're so connected.
Because we're...

40:10.597 --> 40:12.232
We make a really great team.

40:15.435 --> 40:17.803
Like, we've always
got each other's backs,

40:17.805 --> 40:19.404
like, when you wouldn't
let me drive drunk

40:19.406 --> 40:20.571
the other night at Steve's.

40:20.573 --> 40:21.939
That was super clutch.

40:21.941 --> 40:26.111
And, I mean, that night
with that weird dude,

40:26.113 --> 40:28.180
it reminded me

40:28.182 --> 40:29.984
that I would fight like crazy
not to lose you.

40:30.685 --> 40:31.753
You know?

40:32.986 --> 40:36.223
'Cause our connection
is really powerful.

40:52.439 --> 40:54.205
Steve was so wasted
at the party.

40:54.207 --> 40:56.008
He's flirting with
this girl from Monroe

40:56.010 --> 40:58.209
and turns out that's
Stephanie's best friend.

41:13.493 --> 41:16.227
Jolene, can I have the car
when we get home?

41:16.229 --> 41:17.729
That's the shit I don't like.

41:17.731 --> 41:19.200
I have to hit the library.

41:19.700 --> 41:20.901
Nerd.

41:41.589 --> 41:42.787
Hey.

41:42.789 --> 41:44.490
I hope we still have
some time to do stuff.

41:44.492 --> 41:46.892
I basically had to steal
my sister's car.

41:46.894 --> 41:48.394
You were easy to find,
at least.

41:48.396 --> 41:50.129
You're the only person
here my age.

41:50.131 --> 41:51.830
Do I know you?

41:51.832 --> 41:53.832
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

41:53.834 --> 41:55.901
I mistook you
for someone else.

41:55.903 --> 41:57.903
I don't know
what he looks like.

41:57.905 --> 42:00.872
It's not a Tinder thing.

42:02.542 --> 42:03.944
I'm kidding. It's me, A.

42:04.879 --> 42:06.078
Oh, my God!

42:06.080 --> 42:07.712
- That was not funny!
- It was a joke.

42:07.714 --> 42:08.848
I can't believe
you just did that.

42:08.850 --> 42:10.690
- I never get to do this.
- That was not funny!

42:14.622 --> 42:16.087
Maybe it was a little funny.

42:16.089 --> 42:17.091
No.

42:21.062 --> 42:22.861
Nice shirt, by the way.

42:22.863 --> 42:24.729
His mom buys his clothes.

42:24.731 --> 42:26.165
Actually, I kinda like it.

42:26.167 --> 42:27.869
Well, he hates it.

42:29.870 --> 42:31.937
I've been in homeschool
situations before,

42:31.939 --> 42:33.872
and some were great.

42:33.874 --> 42:35.607
But this one's prison.

42:35.609 --> 42:37.942
And the warden is a mom

42:37.944 --> 42:41.712
who speaks really slowly.

42:41.714 --> 42:43.749
But you got her
to take you to a library?

42:43.751 --> 42:45.917
Yeah, for an hour.

42:45.919 --> 42:47.419
And I have to have
50 new facts

42:47.421 --> 42:49.455
memorized by the time
she picks me up.

42:49.457 --> 42:50.990
Okay, so let's get you
some facts.

42:50.992 --> 42:52.292
It can wait.

42:53.493 --> 42:55.329
Tell me about your day.

42:56.464 --> 42:58.466
It was just a day.

43:01.135 --> 43:02.968
I was thinking about you.

43:02.970 --> 43:04.250
You were?

43:05.339 --> 43:06.605
Jeez.

43:06.607 --> 43:07.609
You were?

43:08.908 --> 43:10.841
Yeah, well, I mean,

43:10.843 --> 43:13.548
what was it like
when you were younger,

43:14.281 --> 43:15.650
being you?

43:18.986 --> 43:21.185
Best I could tell,

43:21.187 --> 43:22.990
I was born somewhere
in Phoenix, maybe.

43:25.091 --> 43:27.758
But the family I was with,
this one day,

43:27.760 --> 43:31.464
they flew to Detroit
for a wedding.

43:31.466 --> 43:34.033
And I bounced around Michigan
for a while.

43:34.035 --> 43:36.134
You couldn't
get back to Arizona?

43:36.136 --> 43:38.169
No. Like I told you,

43:38.171 --> 43:39.971
I can't choose
who I wake up in.

43:39.973 --> 43:41.175
Right.

43:41.809 --> 43:43.044
But I meant,

43:43.877 --> 43:46.681
what was it like for you?

43:48.548 --> 43:50.515
Well...

43:50.517 --> 43:52.651
I didn't figure out I was
different from other people

43:52.653 --> 43:54.586
until I was six or so.

43:54.588 --> 43:56.022
<i>What tipped me off</i>

43:56.024 --> 43:59.491
was the way people would
talk about tomorrow.

43:59.493 --> 44:02.394
<i>The things we'd do,
the places we'd go.</i>

44:02.396 --> 44:04.029
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

44:04.031 --> 44:06.899
<i>As though
we'd all be together.</i>

44:06.901 --> 44:10.234
<i>Which I knew we wouldn't.</i>

44:10.236 --> 44:11.803
<i>But anytime
I tried to say that,</i>

44:11.805 --> 44:13.370
<i>the people,
they wouldn't understand.</i>

44:13.372 --> 44:14.908
<i>They'd think it was
a joke or a game.</i>

44:15.843 --> 44:17.609
<i>Or else they'd get worried.</i>

44:17.611 --> 44:20.611
After a while,
I just realized my tomorrows

44:20.613 --> 44:22.749
are very different
from everyone else's.

44:26.252 --> 44:29.053
And you never
found anyone else like you?

44:29.055 --> 44:30.390
No.

44:32.225 --> 44:34.426
I mean, I search online,

44:34.428 --> 44:36.028
message boards

44:36.030 --> 44:40.031
people talking about
being taken over.

44:40.033 --> 44:42.234
There's a subreddit
that's interesting.

44:43.937 --> 44:46.037
Should we get you some facts?

44:46.039 --> 44:47.307
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

44:48.209 --> 44:50.008
47, chicken.

44:50.010 --> 44:53.312
Chicken gestates for 22 days.

44:53.314 --> 44:54.946
48, goat.

44:54.948 --> 45:00.551
Goat gestates
for 136 to 160 days.

45:00.553 --> 45:02.654
49, groundhog.

45:02.656 --> 45:06.390
Groundhog gestates
for 31 to 32 days.

45:06.392 --> 45:07.859
50, kangaroo.

45:07.861 --> 45:11.665
Kangaroo gestates
for 32 to 39 days.

45:13.232 --> 45:15.232
Wow. These are great.

45:15.234 --> 45:17.271
They're really gonna
unsettle his mom.

45:18.037 --> 45:20.040
So, how'd I do?

45:21.742 --> 45:23.107
I don't know, I didn't check.

45:23.109 --> 45:24.875
You didn't check?

45:24.877 --> 45:26.212
I think I did all right.

45:26.214 --> 45:27.779
I think so, too.

45:27.781 --> 45:28.982
Where's my reward?

45:31.651 --> 45:32.753
George!

45:33.953 --> 45:37.288
What kind of a whore...

45:37.290 --> 45:38.658
- She really does talk slow.
- Yeah.

45:38.660 --> 45:40.359
- ...seduces my son?
- Hey, just run.

45:40.361 --> 45:41.963
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, run!

46:16.629 --> 46:17.798
Rhi, 6:30.

46:19.800 --> 46:21.169
Holy shit!

46:22.502 --> 46:23.901
What is it?

46:23.903 --> 46:25.272
Nothing.

46:37.850 --> 46:39.720
I will be cool about this.

46:41.754 --> 46:43.124
I promise.

46:46.993 --> 46:49.761
Nick, it's Walmart,
not the Yukon.

46:49.763 --> 46:51.698
I can't. Please?

46:53.734 --> 46:55.000
Hey.

46:55.002 --> 46:57.069
Everything okay?

46:57.071 --> 46:59.774
Yeah. Just,
have a good day at work.

47:01.341 --> 47:02.543
Hey, wait.

47:04.577 --> 47:05.746
Come here.

47:09.149 --> 47:12.584
I need to go to DC on Sunday
with my team for a pitch.

47:12.586 --> 47:14.419
We could squeeze in
a little sightseeing,

47:14.421 --> 47:16.323
little shopping,
if you wanna come?

47:18.091 --> 47:19.260
I wanna come.

47:20.193 --> 47:21.392
Good.

47:21.394 --> 47:22.627
Okay, have a good day.

47:22.629 --> 47:23.798
I love you.

47:27.234 --> 47:29.771
Be cool, be cool, be cool.

47:31.571 --> 47:33.404
I'm sorry!

47:33.406 --> 47:34.876
I didn't mean to look.

47:39.046 --> 47:40.812
Dude, were you gonna wake
me up? We're gonna be late.

47:40.814 --> 47:42.214
Sorry.

47:42.216 --> 47:43.718
What the shit are you doing?

47:47.088 --> 47:50.524
Siri, set an alarm
for 11:00 p.m.

47:58.999 --> 48:00.400
Your makeup looks different.

48:02.068 --> 48:03.236
It's good.

48:05.571 --> 48:06.839
Breakfast?

48:06.841 --> 48:08.573
Oh, my God!

48:08.575 --> 48:10.776
I'm sorry,
I completely forgot.

48:10.778 --> 48:12.477
It's okay, I hate that shit.

48:20.921 --> 48:22.156
Everything okay with you?

48:23.390 --> 48:25.426
You just look
really pretty today.

48:27.026 --> 48:28.428
So do your balls.

48:37.738 --> 48:39.573
All right,
keep your panties on.

49:12.872 --> 49:14.008
Hey.

49:14.908 --> 49:16.477
You're lookin' sexy today.

49:17.010 --> 49:18.312
Oh.

49:19.513 --> 49:21.379
I mean, more than usual.

49:21.381 --> 49:22.848
Well, thanks.

49:22.850 --> 49:25.185
Thank you for lookin' so sexy.

49:26.153 --> 49:27.553
So...

49:27.555 --> 49:29.675
Do you wanna get out of here,
and go back to my place?

49:30.156 --> 49:32.223
Maybe not today.

49:32.225 --> 49:33.861
I thought you like
when we do that.

49:36.731 --> 49:39.229
You have no idea
what I like, do you?

49:39.231 --> 49:40.634
Excuse me?

49:41.669 --> 49:43.200
I like leaving with you

49:43.202 --> 49:45.203
if you're going to give me
a special day.

49:45.205 --> 49:46.671
If you're going
to give me a day

49:46.673 --> 49:48.807
of fooling around
in your gross room

49:48.809 --> 49:50.075
watching you play video games,

49:50.077 --> 49:51.843
and maybe getting
McDonald's for lunch

49:51.845 --> 49:54.046
that does not qualify
as special.

49:54.048 --> 49:55.712
Qualifies as awesome, though.

49:55.714 --> 49:57.048
No, it doesn't.

49:57.050 --> 49:59.218
We've had one awesome day
in months.

49:59.220 --> 50:01.419
I'm sick of hearing
about this day!

50:01.421 --> 50:02.553
Is that because
you don't remember it,

50:02.555 --> 50:03.835
because you weren't
really there?

50:07.193 --> 50:08.694
Do me a favor

50:08.696 --> 50:10.698
and don't talk to me
again today.

50:11.765 --> 50:12.964
Are you on
your period already?

50:12.966 --> 50:14.366
It's been, like,
a week and a half.

50:14.368 --> 50:16.570
Congratulations,
you're not a father!

50:23.410 --> 50:25.209
I'm sorry.

50:25.211 --> 50:26.847
I lost control.

50:28.749 --> 50:31.419
Please, please don't be
mad at me tomorrow.

50:48.435 --> 50:49.770
Everything okay?

50:50.736 --> 50:52.005
Mmm-hmm.

50:55.876 --> 50:56.944
Thanks.

51:02.749 --> 51:05.017
Dad, why do you paint?

51:05.019 --> 51:06.587
You never ask about my work.

51:11.758 --> 51:14.091
Uh...

51:14.093 --> 51:18.562
I think when I started
doing insurance

51:18.564 --> 51:20.999
and gave up on painting,

51:21.001 --> 51:24.638
that maybe I bottled up things
that I shouldn't have.

51:26.205 --> 51:29.642
All those years, doing
something that wasn't me.

51:30.943 --> 51:32.312
Took its toll?

51:34.281 --> 51:35.316
Yeah.

51:40.821 --> 51:42.523
So why faces?

51:48.294 --> 51:52.330
I suppose it's like
"Write what you know."

51:52.332 --> 51:53.801
Paint what you see.

51:56.870 --> 51:58.305
In my mind's eye...

51:59.205 --> 52:01.205
This is what I see.

52:01.207 --> 52:03.176
Some face of someone
I don't know.

52:06.213 --> 52:07.515
They're just there.

52:08.881 --> 52:12.218
I wanna give 'em
the space to exist, live...

52:12.986 --> 52:13.988
Be.

52:16.990 --> 52:19.193
I could use a fresh face.

52:21.595 --> 52:22.830
Wanna sit for me?

52:24.865 --> 52:26.230
Yeah.

52:26.232 --> 52:27.566
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

52:27.568 --> 52:28.569
Okay.

52:30.336 --> 52:31.868
<i>So I was you yesterday.</i>

52:31.870 --> 52:35.006
<i>And I tried to leave you
every memory.</i>

52:35.008 --> 52:39.009
<i>I tried to change things
for you as little as possible.</i>

52:39.011 --> 52:41.044
<i>Although, I did do
a week of your homework.</i>

52:41.046 --> 52:43.247
<i>And I'm amazing at homework.</i>

52:43.249 --> 52:47.218
<i>No need to thank me.
Okay, fine, you're welcome.</i>

52:47.220 --> 52:50.421
<i>I need you to know that
I didn't choose to be you.</i>

52:50.423 --> 52:52.725
<i>I wouldn't choose that,
even if I could.</i>

52:53.894 --> 52:55.225
<i>And in all of my years</i>

52:55.227 --> 52:56.761
<i>I've never woken up
in the body</i>

52:56.763 --> 52:58.432
<i>of someone I care
so much about.</i>

52:59.932 --> 53:01.232
<i>It was the best</i>

53:01.234 --> 53:03.570
<i>and most terrifying day
of my life so far.</i>

53:05.571 --> 53:07.774
<i>You are the only reason why.</i>

53:09.542 --> 53:11.377
<i>Yours, A.</i>

53:40.807 --> 53:41.973
Hey.

53:41.975 --> 53:43.508
Hey, babe,
what are you doing here?

53:43.510 --> 53:45.613
I think we need
to take a break.

53:47.281 --> 53:51.415
But this stuff between us
is great, our connection.

53:51.417 --> 53:52.986
It's really not.

53:53.986 --> 53:55.620
You don't see me.

53:55.622 --> 53:56.821
I can see you.

53:56.823 --> 53:58.658
You have no idea who I am.

54:03.530 --> 54:04.999
Have a nice life.

54:20.881 --> 54:21.882
Hey.

54:24.618 --> 54:26.116
Are you kidding?

54:26.118 --> 54:29.789
I woke up feeling clearer than
I ever have in my entire life.

54:32.492 --> 54:34.359
Where are you today?

54:34.361 --> 54:35.563
<i>I wanna see you.</i>

54:47.740 --> 54:48.906
What?

54:48.908 --> 54:49.910
Nothing.

54:53.814 --> 54:55.580
What?

54:55.582 --> 54:57.480
Your hand feels different.

54:57.482 --> 54:59.553
Yours feels the same.

55:02.122 --> 55:04.723
Thanks for not breaking up
with Justin.

55:04.725 --> 55:07.694
Honestly, it was not easy.

55:21.874 --> 55:23.908
My uncle's
in California right now.

55:23.910 --> 55:26.611
He barely uses
this place, anyway.

55:26.613 --> 55:28.546
But I have to be home
by Sunday afternoon

55:28.548 --> 55:29.747
to hang with my mom.

55:29.749 --> 55:31.017
Oh, yeah. Right.

55:37.423 --> 55:39.392
So this is our weekend?

55:40.593 --> 55:42.328
This is our weekend.

55:52.372 --> 55:54.808
Was that just because
I look like this?

55:56.977 --> 55:58.779
It's because you're you.

56:01.080 --> 56:03.950
And ten percent
because you look like that.

56:05.352 --> 56:07.721
So, you actually
remember everything?

56:08.988 --> 56:10.622
Well, it was like
I went to bed Thursday

56:10.624 --> 56:11.955
and woke up today

56:11.957 --> 56:15.125
wearing a really strange bra,
thank you very much.

56:15.127 --> 56:18.365
But with all these memories,
somehow, with you in them.

56:19.798 --> 56:21.633
That must be really weird.

56:21.635 --> 56:24.269
No, it's amazing.

56:24.271 --> 56:27.404
A, I think you should let
people remember you.

56:27.406 --> 56:28.807
I think you should leave

56:28.809 --> 56:31.008
more memories behind
for more people

56:31.010 --> 56:32.576
and make more of a mark.

56:32.578 --> 56:35.647
You're such a bright,
beautiful, kind, funny...

56:35.649 --> 56:36.650
Thing.

56:37.216 --> 56:38.482
Person.

56:38.484 --> 56:39.584
You're not freaked out anymore

56:39.586 --> 56:40.986
that the first time
that we met,

56:40.988 --> 56:44.022
I let you kiss me, and tell me
all this personal stuff

56:44.024 --> 56:47.558
without knowing that...
That I was there?

56:47.560 --> 56:51.698
Well, you must kiss
a lot of people.

56:53.834 --> 56:56.036
And hear a lot
of personal stuff.

56:57.437 --> 56:58.639
Yeah, I...

57:01.841 --> 57:05.743
I've been a lot of boyfriends
and a lot of girlfriends.

57:05.745 --> 57:07.979
How does that not sound
terrible to you?

57:07.981 --> 57:11.216
A, it sounds incredible.

57:11.218 --> 57:12.950
So why midnight?

57:12.952 --> 57:16.888
As far as I can tell,
I get 24 hours in each house.

57:16.890 --> 57:19.790
After that, I get pushed out.

57:19.792 --> 57:21.426
"Pushed out"?

57:21.428 --> 57:23.194
By the person
whose place I'm taking.

57:23.196 --> 57:24.962
When they return,

57:24.964 --> 57:27.232
I don't know,
it's just what it feels like.

57:27.234 --> 57:29.232
What happens
when you push back?

57:29.234 --> 57:32.606
I don't. When it's time
to go, it's not my body.

57:33.707 --> 57:35.372
Look, we just
haven't gotten that far

57:35.374 --> 57:37.375
in AP paranormal biology, yet.

57:37.377 --> 57:39.142
But I think it's being covered
in the spring.

57:39.144 --> 57:40.380
Come on.

57:42.448 --> 57:45.985
So, do you consider yourself
a boy or a girl?

57:48.354 --> 57:49.356
Yes.

57:57.564 --> 57:59.363
See you tomorrow.

57:59.365 --> 58:00.400
I promise.

59:28.287 --> 59:29.967
You wanna up
and disappear, fine.

59:30.756 --> 59:32.022
You do it on a day

59:32.024 --> 59:34.758
when we're supposed to go
to DC together, rude!

59:34.760 --> 59:36.127
I didn't forget. I just...

59:36.129 --> 59:38.729
You can't expect me
to drop everything

59:38.731 --> 59:40.265
that I'm doing
for this family

59:40.267 --> 59:41.832
to drive for three hours

59:41.834 --> 59:43.033
to pick you up from a vacation

59:43.035 --> 59:45.136
you just up and decided
to give yourself.

59:45.138 --> 59:46.904
Apparently this family's
not the only thing

59:46.906 --> 59:48.471
keeping you busy after work.

59:48.473 --> 59:49.776
Excuse me?

59:51.943 --> 59:55.915
Rhiannon, what the hell
is going on with you?

59:58.452 --> 59:59.850
I just...

59:59.852 --> 01:00:01.287
You just what?

01:00:02.021 --> 01:00:03.022
I...

01:00:06.158 --> 01:00:07.827
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

01:00:37.122 --> 01:00:39.723
Michael! I thought you were
already up and showered!

01:00:39.725 --> 01:00:43.560
Oh, my goodness!
We are gonna miss our flight!

01:00:43.562 --> 01:00:45.698
Hustle your ass, Michael!

01:01:05.185 --> 01:01:07.218
Hey! Can you pick me up today?

01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:08.486
Mikey! God damn it, Michael!

01:01:08.488 --> 01:01:10.421
My family's supposed to
fly to Honolulu today.

01:01:10.423 --> 01:01:11.855
If I go,

01:01:11.857 --> 01:01:14.057
tomorrow, I wake up as a kid
who's not flying back here.

01:01:15.193 --> 01:01:16.361
Silver Springs.

01:01:16.363 --> 01:01:17.761
There's a Target
down the highway.

01:01:17.763 --> 01:01:19.296
Meet me in the parking lot.

01:01:19.298 --> 01:01:21.468
Oh, my God!
This kid does not exercise!

01:01:31.044 --> 01:01:33.310
- Michael!
- Shit!

01:01:33.312 --> 01:01:35.279
- Hey. Over here!
- Michael! Michael, get...

01:01:35.281 --> 01:01:36.446
Get back here!

01:01:36.448 --> 01:01:37.714
Okay! Slow down
but don't stop!

01:01:37.716 --> 01:01:39.183
I can't hear you!

01:01:39.185 --> 01:01:40.484
- Shit! Do stop!
- What?

01:01:40.486 --> 01:01:42.289
- Stop!
- Shit! Shit!

01:01:43.055 --> 01:01:44.057
Michael!

01:01:45.392 --> 01:01:46.491
- Got it!
- Oh, God.

01:01:46.493 --> 01:01:47.658
Jolene's gonna kill me.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.125
Michael!

01:01:49.127 --> 01:01:51.062
- Get back here!
- Go! Go!

01:01:51.064 --> 01:01:52.499
Okay, okay.

01:01:53.899 --> 01:01:55.801
What are you doing
with my son?

01:02:03.276 --> 01:02:04.609
I'm sorry.

01:02:04.611 --> 01:02:07.314
Well, had to be done.
Couldn't lose you to Hawaii.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.247
But where were you?

01:02:09.249 --> 01:02:10.480
I couldn't come.

01:02:10.482 --> 01:02:12.917
Well, I was alone, and cold,
and freaked out!

01:02:12.919 --> 01:02:14.019
And if my mom hadn't come,

01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:15.285
I don't know
what would've happened.

01:02:15.287 --> 01:02:17.587
Not to mention
that she's pissed at me,

01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:19.624
and I can't even
begin to explain why!

01:02:19.626 --> 01:02:21.258
- I'm sorry!
- Where were you, A?

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.127
- Getting a lung transplant.
- Shut up!

01:02:23.129 --> 01:02:24.962
I woke up in the evening.
I had no way to call you.

01:02:24.964 --> 01:02:27.464
I couldn't contact you. They
wouldn't even give me a phone.

01:02:27.466 --> 01:02:28.765
You're serious?

01:02:28.767 --> 01:02:29.769
Yes.

01:02:32.972 --> 01:02:34.973
Well, was it successful?

01:02:34.975 --> 01:02:36.540
I think so.

01:02:36.542 --> 01:02:38.508
Oh, God!

01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:41.345
I feel awful
about abandoning you.

01:02:41.347 --> 01:02:43.180
No.
No, it was my fault.

01:02:43.182 --> 01:02:45.519
The weekend
was my terrible idea.

01:02:47.118 --> 01:02:48.988
You think it was
a terrible idea?

01:02:49.488 --> 01:02:51.323
What? No.

01:02:52.258 --> 01:02:54.360
I mean, it was amazing, too.

01:02:55.796 --> 01:02:57.261
I just...

01:02:57.263 --> 01:02:59.332
I think we need
to be more careful.

01:03:01.301 --> 01:03:02.436
Yeah.

01:03:15.347 --> 01:03:17.516
<i>You know,
I thought you'd "left" left.</i>

01:03:18.484 --> 01:03:21.218
<i>I'd never leave.</i>

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:22.688
<i>Other than every day.</i>

01:03:32.932 --> 01:03:36.000
<i>Do you think
we can keep doing this?</i>

01:03:36.002 --> 01:03:37.901
<i>I mean, not knowing
who I'm gonna be</i>

01:03:37.903 --> 01:03:39.405
<i>or where I'm gonna
show up next?</i>

01:03:47.546 --> 01:03:49.145
<i>I guess I should
probably go clean up</i>

01:03:49.147 --> 01:03:50.916
<i>whatever chaos we caused
for this kid.</i>

01:03:55.588 --> 01:03:57.223
<i>We'll figure this out.</i>

01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:58.892
<i>I promise.</i>

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.795
Weird hands?

01:04:03.595 --> 01:04:05.264
Less than you'd think.

01:04:22.548 --> 01:04:24.785
Jo, I'm really
sorry about the car.

01:04:26.553 --> 01:04:28.255
I feel horrible.

01:04:33.459 --> 01:04:35.361
Can I tell you
what's happening?

01:04:39.432 --> 01:04:40.897
I'm in love with someone

01:04:40.899 --> 01:04:44.102
who wakes up in a different
body every day.

01:04:44.104 --> 01:04:47.904
Always the same age,
never the same person twice.

01:04:47.906 --> 01:04:49.272
Yesterday it was a kid

01:04:49.274 --> 01:04:51.408
I needed to save
from his family.

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:53.276
Saturday, it was the guy
in the pickup.

01:04:53.278 --> 01:04:55.779
And Sunday, it was someone who
couldn't make it to the cabin.

01:04:55.781 --> 01:04:59.683
So, that's what this is.

01:04:59.685 --> 01:05:01.319
Look,

01:05:01.321 --> 01:05:03.553
whatever weird,
fake, role-playing,

01:05:03.555 --> 01:05:05.488
polyamorous-type shit
you're into nowadays,

01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:06.691
just don't involve me.

01:05:06.693 --> 01:05:07.792
Jolene, it's real.

01:05:07.794 --> 01:05:09.396
And don't involve
my goddamn car.

01:05:29.048 --> 01:05:30.881
Because I'm stupidly nice,

01:05:30.883 --> 01:05:32.950
I'll excuse
yesterday's absence.

01:05:36.222 --> 01:05:37.622
Can't happen again, Rhiannon.

01:05:37.624 --> 01:05:38.692
It won't.

01:05:40.526 --> 01:05:43.593
Hey, where'd you go yesterday?

01:05:43.595 --> 01:05:46.430
I just didn't feel
like being at school.

01:05:46.432 --> 01:05:48.832
Rhiannon, why are you not
telling me anything anymore?

01:05:48.834 --> 01:05:50.033
And who is that rando
you hooked up with

01:05:50.035 --> 01:05:51.769
- over the weekend?
- What rando?

01:05:51.771 --> 01:05:53.803
What are you talking about?

01:05:53.805 --> 01:05:55.538
Jolene told her friends
that some guy abandoned you

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:57.174
in the middle of the woods
with no car.

01:05:57.176 --> 01:05:58.609
That's, like,
the ultimate rando move.

01:05:58.611 --> 01:06:00.480
Why is this
everyone's business?

01:06:01.046 --> 01:06:02.212
It's not.

01:06:02.214 --> 01:06:04.094
But I figured it's mine
because I'm your friend.

01:06:05.184 --> 01:06:06.720
At least I used to be.

01:06:19.198 --> 01:06:20.263
<i>Hello?</i>

01:06:20.265 --> 01:06:21.497
Is it you?

01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:22.501
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:06:23.535 --> 01:06:27.071
I got your message. Wow.

01:06:27.073 --> 01:06:30.207
<i>Yeah. I knew
she had some dark thoughts.</i>

01:06:30.209 --> 01:06:32.176
<i>Maybe an hour ago
I decided to draw</i>

01:06:32.178 --> 01:06:33.576
<i>something cheerful
in one of her notebooks.</i>

01:06:33.578 --> 01:06:35.546
<i>Make her feel better.</i>

01:06:35.548 --> 01:06:37.517
<i>That's where
she had it written down.</i>

01:06:43.222 --> 01:06:45.357
She's got it
all planned out.

01:06:49.963 --> 01:06:51.495
If her dad finds her pills,

01:06:51.497 --> 01:06:53.867
she's gonna drive into the
side of an overpass.

01:06:57.703 --> 01:06:59.270
When does her dad come home?

01:06:59.272 --> 01:07:00.504
He doesn't leave the hospital

01:07:00.506 --> 01:07:04.109
until 5:00 a.m.
He's in surgery until then.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.145
You've got to stop her.

01:07:09.147 --> 01:07:10.314
There's nothing I can do.

01:07:10.316 --> 01:07:11.318
You don't believe that.

01:07:12.919 --> 01:07:16.087
Call her father!
Call a counselor.

01:07:16.089 --> 01:07:17.754
It's Kelsea's life, not mine.

01:07:17.756 --> 01:07:19.423
So, if she were gonna
kill someone,

01:07:19.425 --> 01:07:20.758
what would you do then?

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.892
- I'd turn her in.
- Right!

01:07:22.894 --> 01:07:24.761
So how is this different?

01:07:24.763 --> 01:07:26.263
It's not fair of me
to do something

01:07:26.265 --> 01:07:28.799
that makes up
her mind for her.

01:07:28.801 --> 01:07:30.734
So you never,
ever get involved

01:07:30.736 --> 01:07:32.569
in the lives of the people
you're inhabiting?

01:07:32.571 --> 01:07:34.071
I can't.

01:07:34.073 --> 01:07:36.743
What about Justin?
What made that so different?

01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:38.611
You.

01:07:41.981 --> 01:07:43.613
If you leave her at midnight,

01:07:43.615 --> 01:07:45.749
she's going to go
through with it.

01:07:45.751 --> 01:07:47.953
So, you're just gonna have to
try and stay.

01:07:55.361 --> 01:07:57.163
I believe you can do it.

01:07:58.263 --> 01:08:00.834
And I need you
to believe it, too.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.102
How?

01:08:06.972 --> 01:08:08.174
Push back.

01:08:11.977 --> 01:08:13.312
Stay with me?

01:08:41.473 --> 01:08:43.006
Honey?

01:08:43.008 --> 01:08:44.778
You need to get me help, Dad.

01:08:48.314 --> 01:08:50.550
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

01:09:17.743 --> 01:09:20.046
Ugh! I'm up, Mom! Jeez.

01:09:23.281 --> 01:09:24.383
Sweetie?

01:09:30.721 --> 01:09:32.158
You feeling okay?

01:09:34.091 --> 01:09:38.528
Jo said you told her something
kinda strange.

01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:41.229
About meeting someone who's in
a different body every day?

01:09:41.232 --> 01:09:42.468
It was a joke.

01:09:43.033 --> 01:09:44.037
All right.

01:09:46.372 --> 01:09:47.372
Hey.

01:09:50.075 --> 01:09:51.410
I love you, Rhi.

01:09:52.609 --> 01:09:54.780
If you ever need to talk,
I'm always here.

01:10:01.454 --> 01:10:02.455
Dad?

01:10:05.022 --> 01:10:06.957
Do you still love Mom?

01:10:06.959 --> 01:10:08.560
Of course I do, sweetheart.

01:10:11.029 --> 01:10:14.064
I don't think we can know
what it's like

01:10:14.066 --> 01:10:16.101
when you're in love
with someone

01:10:18.471 --> 01:10:19.873
and they change.

01:10:30.115 --> 01:10:31.415
Hey, what's up, slut?

01:10:31.417 --> 01:10:34.151
Hey, don't shame the slut.
Rhi, I'm proud of you.

01:10:34.153 --> 01:10:35.318
Stay slutty.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.089
Shut up, dumbass!

01:10:40.793 --> 01:10:42.158
Hi.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.163
Hi.

01:10:44.363 --> 01:10:45.932
I really missed you yesterday.

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:50.134
I'm sorry about those guys.
It's my fault.

01:10:50.136 --> 01:10:53.306
It's nothing.
So tell me everything.

01:10:58.311 --> 01:11:00.710
She's got more
appointments tomorrow.

01:11:00.712 --> 01:11:03.513
Doctors,
maybe an overnight stay.

01:11:03.515 --> 01:11:06.715
Probably she goes
on medication.

01:11:06.717 --> 01:11:10.155
I hope it turns out okay.
I mean, I think it could,

01:11:11.356 --> 01:11:13.157
but it's her life, so...

01:11:13.159 --> 01:11:16.529
It is. And you saved it.

01:11:17.896 --> 01:11:18.897
You stayed.

01:11:20.199 --> 01:11:23.032
I stayed.

01:11:23.034 --> 01:11:26.338
So that means you can stay
in someone else, maybe?

01:11:28.574 --> 01:11:30.875
Maybe I could.

01:11:30.877 --> 01:11:32.712
What are you doing tonight?

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:36.345
Date.

01:11:36.347 --> 01:11:38.715
Not with you.

01:11:38.717 --> 01:11:40.751
With her boyfriend.
It's their anniversary.

01:11:40.753 --> 01:11:42.355
I probably shouldn't miss it.

01:11:43.388 --> 01:11:45.458
Well, maybe tomorrow then.

01:11:53.332 --> 01:11:54.334
Can I kiss you?

01:11:56.769 --> 01:11:57.770
Yeah.

01:12:10.548 --> 01:12:11.551
Hi.

01:12:13.918 --> 01:12:15.185
What are you doing up so late?

01:12:15.187 --> 01:12:17.089
I thought you had
a test tomorrow.

01:12:18.789 --> 01:12:22.729
Mom, I know you and Dad
are trying to make it work.

01:12:25.596 --> 01:12:29.032
But every day you can

01:12:29.034 --> 01:12:31.335
grow a little bit closer
to each other

01:12:31.337 --> 01:12:34.941
or you can grow
a little bit farther apart.

01:12:36.775 --> 01:12:37.809
Okay.

01:12:42.047 --> 01:12:46.283
Look, I know Dad
is not who he was.

01:12:46.285 --> 01:12:48.887
But you're not
who you were, either.

01:12:50.288 --> 01:12:52.257
Because we all change.

01:12:55.526 --> 01:12:58.263
And you've changed, too.

01:13:00.999 --> 01:13:02.200
So,

01:13:03.467 --> 01:13:04.803
please, just grow closer.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.514
He's amazing, Rhiannon.

01:14:24.516 --> 01:14:28.653
He's curious and kind,
and handsome.

01:14:30.154 --> 01:14:32.022
It's funny,
I've known him for so long,

01:14:32.024 --> 01:14:33.723
but I don't know
much about him.

01:14:33.725 --> 01:14:35.192
He's so shy at school.

01:14:35.194 --> 01:14:38.362
Yeah, he's not the kinda kid
that's built for high school.

01:14:38.364 --> 01:14:41.031
He's built for what
comes next.

01:14:41.033 --> 01:14:43.903
He remembers
beautiful things beautifully.

01:14:44.802 --> 01:14:46.469
He reads and he sees.

01:14:46.471 --> 01:14:49.572
And he listens
with every part of himself.

01:14:49.574 --> 01:14:52.675
He sees what's funny in people
without ever being cruel.

01:14:52.677 --> 01:14:54.344
Excuse me, I'll take this guy

01:14:54.346 --> 01:14:56.346
if you don't want him.
Who is he?

01:14:56.348 --> 01:14:58.383
He's talking about himself.

01:15:00.052 --> 01:15:01.053
Hi.

01:15:10.730 --> 01:15:12.962
So, do you have plans
after school?

01:15:12.964 --> 01:15:14.266
It is after school.

01:15:17.903 --> 01:15:19.969
What is happening?

01:15:19.971 --> 01:15:21.139
Where are we going?

01:16:24.101 --> 01:16:25.969
Do you think you could
stay in Alexander

01:16:25.971 --> 01:16:27.073
for one more day?

01:16:30.542 --> 01:16:31.811
I'm not sure.

01:16:33.745 --> 01:16:34.913
You did it with Kelsea.

01:16:36.449 --> 01:16:38.751
With Kelsea it was easier,
I think, 'cause

01:16:39.819 --> 01:16:41.921
I guess she didn't wanna
be here anymore.

01:16:44.088 --> 01:16:45.290
It's fine.

01:16:46.091 --> 01:16:47.927
I get it. It's all good.

01:16:53.464 --> 01:16:55.668
Would make things easier,
though, wouldn't it?

01:17:01.672 --> 01:17:02.675
Rhi?

01:17:04.008 --> 01:17:05.011
Hey.

01:17:18.156 --> 01:17:21.394
Oh, my God! You stayed!

01:17:22.961 --> 01:17:24.597
That's so exciting!

01:17:33.905 --> 01:17:35.607
I knew exactly what it was.

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.341
Date night again tonight?

01:17:38.343 --> 01:17:41.079
Tomorrow?
I have to study for a test.

01:17:41.913 --> 01:17:43.081
Tomorrow.

01:17:44.216 --> 01:17:45.685
Wow. Okay.

01:17:53.057 --> 01:17:54.890
Wow.

01:17:54.892 --> 01:17:57.029
Someone's excited
for learning.

01:18:36.901 --> 01:18:38.203
I love you.

01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:40.238
I love you, too.

01:18:43.242 --> 01:18:46.475
I better get home,
or my mom will kill me.

01:18:46.477 --> 01:18:48.213
Should we call it
a night, then?

01:18:50.449 --> 01:18:55.354
Actually, I guess I could
come in for a minute.

01:19:13.538 --> 01:19:14.837
I think
I should go now.

01:19:14.839 --> 01:19:15.841
Yeah.

01:19:26.818 --> 01:19:28.885
Who
forgets their own birthday?

01:19:28.887 --> 01:19:30.786
Is that the new girl's fault?

01:19:30.788 --> 01:19:32.456
Mom, I said I was sorry.

01:19:32.458 --> 01:19:34.023
Past few days,
I don't even recognize you.

01:19:34.025 --> 01:19:36.292
I don't know if this is some
teenage angst bullshit,

01:19:36.294 --> 01:19:37.460
but I won't have it.

01:19:37.462 --> 01:19:38.694
Mom, please don't be mad.

01:19:38.696 --> 01:19:41.163
I'm not mad.

01:19:41.165 --> 01:19:42.532
Your aunts and I
cooked literally all day

01:19:42.534 --> 01:19:43.700
preparing that dinner

01:19:43.702 --> 01:19:44.867
which was at your request.

01:19:44.869 --> 01:19:46.335
All of your favorites.

01:19:46.337 --> 01:19:47.338
I'm just disappointed.

01:19:48.507 --> 01:19:51.143
That was a shitty,
selfish thing you did.

01:19:54.178 --> 01:19:56.214
I'll make it up
to them somehow.

01:20:02.555 --> 01:20:04.890
You have a family
that loves you.

01:20:07.726 --> 01:20:09.562
Don't take that for granted.

01:20:20.337 --> 01:20:21.339
Hey!

01:20:21.739 --> 01:20:23.040
Hey.

01:20:23.042 --> 01:20:24.907
Where have you been?
You weren't in class.

01:20:24.909 --> 01:20:26.009
Rhiannon.

01:20:26.011 --> 01:20:27.376
Did you get in trouble?

01:20:27.378 --> 01:20:28.710
Not as much
as you might think.

01:20:28.712 --> 01:20:30.714
- Oh.
- Rhiannon.

01:20:30.716 --> 01:20:33.515
Hey, are we still on
for tonight?

01:20:33.517 --> 01:20:36.952
His parents went out of town.
So, my place at 8:00?

01:20:36.954 --> 01:20:38.755
Yeah, great.
I'll see you then.

01:20:38.757 --> 01:20:40.025
Hey, Rebecca!

01:20:42.494 --> 01:20:43.929
TGI Friday.

01:20:45.763 --> 01:20:47.897
I've been a bad friend.

01:20:47.899 --> 01:20:50.567
I'm sorry.
I'll tell you everything.

01:20:50.569 --> 01:20:51.971
I don't need an explanation.

01:20:53.337 --> 01:20:55.505
Well, good, because
I'm not really sure

01:20:55.507 --> 01:20:57.576
I would give you one
that would make any sense.

01:20:59.077 --> 01:21:01.344
Are you and Alexander
a thing now?

01:21:01.346 --> 01:21:02.545
Uh...

01:21:02.547 --> 01:21:04.046
Yeah.

01:21:04.048 --> 01:21:05.717
I always thought
you should be together.

01:21:06.517 --> 01:21:07.951
You did?

01:21:07.953 --> 01:21:08.954
Yeah.

01:21:10.623 --> 01:21:12.357
I'm glad you're happy, Rhi.

01:21:13.257 --> 01:21:15.260
I got practice, so, gotta go.

01:21:42.154 --> 01:21:43.652
Wow!

01:21:43.654 --> 01:21:45.390
What is this, the Last Supper?

01:21:46.225 --> 01:21:48.291
More like a first date.

01:21:48.293 --> 01:21:51.263
Turns out,
he's a really great cook.

01:21:51.997 --> 01:21:53.996
He's a really great guy.

01:21:53.998 --> 01:21:55.600
Okay. I know.

01:21:56.635 --> 01:21:58.033
So are you.

01:21:58.035 --> 01:21:59.435
I mean, really great.

01:21:59.437 --> 01:22:03.206
I've never had your cooking
so I can't speak to that.

01:22:03.208 --> 01:22:06.876
Rhiannon, he's got a family
that loves him,

01:22:06.878 --> 01:22:08.113
and that he loves.

01:22:09.314 --> 01:22:11.283
It's everything
I've ever wanted.

01:22:12.115 --> 01:22:14.619
Yeah. It's been nice.

01:22:15.988 --> 01:22:17.323
But it's not mine.

01:22:19.958 --> 01:22:22.994
I'm forcing Alexander out of
his own life, and it's wrong.

01:22:24.296 --> 01:22:26.231
And the longer I stay,
the more I'm damaging him.

01:22:27.199 --> 01:22:28.701
We'll go back to how it was.

01:22:31.503 --> 01:22:34.903
Do you know Flynn
in my algebra class?

01:22:34.905 --> 01:22:37.040
You cannot, under any
circumstance, be him.

01:22:37.042 --> 01:22:39.712
If that's who you wake up in,
then don't even call me.

01:22:43.381 --> 01:22:46.318
I mean, it can be Flynn.
It's not a deal-breaker.

01:22:48.253 --> 01:22:50.055
I can't do it to anybody.

01:22:54.092 --> 01:22:56.262
Not to Alexander,
not to Flynn.

01:22:58.363 --> 01:22:59.932
- Not to you.
- What are you saying?

01:23:01.999 --> 01:23:04.267
I've been thinking about this
over and over and over.

01:23:04.269 --> 01:23:05.835
I'm always going
to be blocking you

01:23:05.837 --> 01:23:08.073
from being with someone
who's perfect for you.

01:23:14.279 --> 01:23:16.013
How could you say that?

01:23:16.015 --> 01:23:18.517
Because Alexander's
perfect for you.

01:23:20.051 --> 01:23:21.216
He's your type!

01:23:21.218 --> 01:23:22.922
You're my type.

01:23:24.355 --> 01:23:26.958
Do you think I wanna
live without you?

01:23:28.526 --> 01:23:30.895
Do you think I'll ever be
happy in a place you're not?

01:23:32.931 --> 01:23:34.898
Go back to a life
that you're not in,

01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:38.367
back to seeing only faces
that aren't yours?

01:23:38.369 --> 01:23:40.506
Hearing only voices
that aren't yours?

01:23:43.574 --> 01:23:45.877
You should be with him.

01:23:48.279 --> 01:23:51.784
He's tall, slim,
nice shoulders.

01:23:57.788 --> 01:23:59.425
He's really smart.

01:24:01.126 --> 01:24:03.292
He's incredibly kind,
he's interesting,

01:24:03.294 --> 01:24:04.795
and thoughtful
on so many levels.

01:24:04.797 --> 01:24:08.264
No! We can make it work, A.

01:24:08.266 --> 01:24:11.000
I wanna believe that!

01:24:11.002 --> 01:24:12.972
You know I wanna believe that.

01:24:26.551 --> 01:24:29.419
Think about what happens
if you and I stay together.

01:24:29.421 --> 01:24:31.656
I mean, really, truly,
imagine it.

01:24:33.792 --> 01:24:35.761
What does that
look like in a year?

01:24:37.195 --> 01:24:38.761
In 10 years?

01:24:38.763 --> 01:24:40.263
What will happen
to your life

01:24:40.265 --> 01:24:43.566
if I'm the person in the world
that you're closest to?

01:24:43.568 --> 01:24:45.070
How alone will it make you

01:24:46.504 --> 01:24:49.372
<i>if the one
that you love is me?</i>

01:24:49.374 --> 01:24:51.308
<i>And the one
that you're with is me.</i>

01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:54.109
<i>And you can't tell
anyone about me.</i>

01:24:54.111 --> 01:24:56.614
<i>How much is that gonna cut you
off from your family?</i>

01:24:58.182 --> 01:25:01.086
<i>How much is that gonna cut you
off from everyone you know?</i>

01:25:06.190 --> 01:25:07.624
<i>And what happens
when I start waking up</i>

01:25:07.626 --> 01:25:09.360
<i>as someone in a marriage?</i>

01:25:11.329 --> 01:25:12.998
<i>Someone with kids?</i>

01:25:15.867 --> 01:25:17.403
<i>What if we want a kid?</i>

01:25:20.771 --> 01:25:22.971
<i>How will it feel for you
to raise that kid</i>

01:25:22.973 --> 01:25:24.340
<i>almost entirely alone</i>

01:25:24.342 --> 01:25:26.209
<i>and not be able
to explain to anyone</i>

01:25:26.211 --> 01:25:27.579
<i>why that's what you chose?</i>

01:25:30.714 --> 01:25:32.383
<i>Whose kid is that gonna be?</i>

01:25:34.319 --> 01:25:35.587
<i>Is that gonna be my kid?</i>

01:25:37.654 --> 01:25:39.255
Or will she be
the kid of some guy

01:25:39.257 --> 01:25:40.857
that you'll never see again

01:25:40.859 --> 01:25:43.992
while my kid leaves you
the day after she's born?

01:25:43.994 --> 01:25:46.196
Will my kid ever know
her parents?

01:25:46.198 --> 01:25:48.497
Or is she gonna have a life
like mine and always wonder...

01:25:48.499 --> 01:25:49.667
Stop.

01:26:00.744 --> 01:26:02.577
Most people know
that their first love

01:26:02.579 --> 01:26:04.149
won't be their only love.

01:26:07.552 --> 01:26:09.188
But for me, you're both.

01:26:18.462 --> 01:26:19.831
Say something.

01:26:35.413 --> 01:26:38.249
We have three hours
until midnight.

01:26:40.418 --> 01:26:42.287
Let's not waste it.

01:26:47.057 --> 01:26:48.791
What else?

01:26:48.793 --> 01:26:50.460
In some minds,

01:26:50.462 --> 01:26:52.728
everything feels
muted and dim.

01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:54.662
And in others,

01:26:54.664 --> 01:26:57.733
it's like everything is
supercharged and unfocused.

01:26:57.735 --> 01:27:00.939
Like a radio flipping
from station to station.

01:27:02.339 --> 01:27:04.142
Hard to get control of.

01:27:05.909 --> 01:27:07.078
What else?

01:27:08.046 --> 01:27:09.481
Um...

01:27:11.281 --> 01:27:12.484
I'm thinking.

01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:21.493
Am I going to see you again?

01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:31.470
I have to believe
that we will.

01:27:33.672 --> 01:27:35.807
But you have to believe
that we won't.

01:27:40.811 --> 01:27:42.446
<i>Where are you
going to go?</i>

01:27:44.515 --> 01:27:45.684
<i>Far away.</i>

01:27:47.318 --> 01:27:48.486
<i>New York.</i>

01:27:49.887 --> 01:27:51.523
<i>Chicago, if I can get there.</i>

01:27:53.792 --> 01:27:56.192
<i>Just some big, dense city</i>

01:27:56.194 --> 01:27:57.829
<i>where there's lots
of people to be.</i>

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:02.999
<i>There's still some things</i>

01:28:03.001 --> 01:28:04.436
<i>I need to figure out
about myself.</i>

01:28:09.673 --> 01:28:14.011
Make marks, okay?
Leave traces.

01:28:15.747 --> 01:28:16.748
Yeah.

01:28:22.753 --> 01:28:23.988
It's time.

01:28:30.994 --> 01:28:33.231
Will you remember
this tomorrow?

01:28:35.165 --> 01:28:36.834
I'll remember everything.

01:28:38.735 --> 01:28:40.137
So will I.

01:28:45.909 --> 01:28:47.845
This is the nice note.

01:28:51.917 --> 01:28:53.151
Good night.

01:29:13.803 --> 01:29:15.039
Good night.

01:29:31.455 --> 01:29:33.255
Katie!

01:29:33.958 --> 01:29:35.594
Katie, you up?

01:29:40.899 --> 01:29:41.932
Katie!

01:30:38.056 --> 01:30:39.156
Hi.

01:30:41.959 --> 01:30:44.796
Has anyone ever told you
you have a nice smile?

01:30:58.043 --> 01:30:59.478
Just being honest.

01:31:50.393 --> 01:31:55.393
