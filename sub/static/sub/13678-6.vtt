00:01.378 --> 00:03.588
<i>It's almost as if...</i>

00:03.672 --> 00:05.423
<i>Something's come alive.</i>

00:05.548 --> 00:07.175
<i>My perfectly
constructed loop.</i>

00:07.258 --> 00:09.511
<i>At 8:00 a.m., breakfast
with my friend Leon.</i>

00:09.594 --> 00:11.846
<i>At 2:00 p.m., we'll
check out a basketball game.</i>

00:11.930 --> 00:13.848
<i>Two days a week,
I go to a church group.</i>

00:13.932 --> 00:15.684
You could use
some practice.

00:15.767 --> 00:18.853
<i>If he's guilty,
I could destroy him
at a terminal.</i>

00:18.937 --> 00:20.271
I told you not to look.

00:21.189 --> 00:22.857
Hey, Daddy.
Hi, pumpkin.

00:22.941 --> 00:24.859
You were drunk,
eating shrimp cocktail,

00:24.943 --> 00:27.362
and it was raining
when you decided
my mother would die?

00:27.445 --> 00:28.780
If you want to
change things,

00:28.863 --> 00:31.282
perhaps you should
try from within.

00:31.408 --> 00:34.786
You want me to
convince the class
to remove the contingency.

00:34.911 --> 00:36.871
You're gonna give me
exactly what I want in return.

00:36.955 --> 00:39.374
<i>I can't wipe
the security footage of
you planting the femtocell.</i>

00:39.457 --> 00:40.709
Angela Moss.

00:40.792 --> 00:44.045
You won't be able to give me
anything I want out of life.

01:38.767 --> 01:40.769
No. I think so.

01:40.852 --> 01:44.898
Oh, Tyrell, Joanna,
meet my silent
partner in crime.

01:44.981 --> 01:46.107
Hi.
Sharon Knowles.

01:46.191 --> 01:47.525
I've heard
many good things.

01:47.609 --> 01:48.777
And her husband, Scott.

01:48.860 --> 01:49.861
How are you?

01:49.944 --> 01:52.071
Tyrell here is our
new rising young star

01:52.155 --> 01:53.740
with an eye on
the CTO position.

01:53.823 --> 01:56.868
But he's gonna have to
wait for Terry Colby's
golf career to take off

01:56.951 --> 01:58.453
or for an early stroke.

02:01.623 --> 02:02.874
Those earrings are stunning.

02:04.709 --> 02:05.919
Thank you.

02:06.085 --> 02:09.214
Tyrell's always surprising
me with little gifts.

02:26.356 --> 02:27.816
Capitalist pig!

02:51.005 --> 02:53.967
<i>"Hello. I see you.</i>

02:54.050 --> 02:55.885
<i>"I recognize you.</i>

02:55.969 --> 02:57.679
<i>"I acknowledge
your existence.</i>

02:58.930 --> 03:00.598
<i>"Let's talk.</i>

03:00.723 --> 03:03.017
<i>"Get to know who
each other really are."</i>

03:03.101 --> 03:04.894
<i>All of this is
said with the simple act</i>

03:04.978 --> 03:07.230
<i>of a handshake
between two people.</i>

03:07.981 --> 03:11.317
<i>It's not any
different between a client
connecting with a server.</i>

03:12.151 --> 03:14.028
<i>It all relies on
that first handshake</i>

03:14.112 --> 03:16.072
<i>and naturally grows
from there</i>

03:17.115 --> 03:18.700
<i>for most people.</i>

03:19.784 --> 03:21.119
<i>Me,</i>

03:22.120 --> 03:24.455
<i>I can't seem to
learn the rules.</i>

03:29.586 --> 03:31.588
What happened back there

03:32.630 --> 03:34.465
when you protected me?

03:35.800 --> 03:38.636
What was that?
I've never seen that before.

03:40.013 --> 03:42.015
That was
what you needed.

03:48.897 --> 03:51.232
Why were you
trying to hide him?

03:51.816 --> 03:52.817
What are you
talking about?

03:52.901 --> 03:54.068
Tyrell.

03:57.780 --> 04:00.491
You were acting like
he wasn't in the trunk.

04:00.575 --> 04:04.162
But Tyrell was there.
I saw him.

04:05.121 --> 04:06.664
I thought we moved
past this.

04:07.206 --> 04:08.374
Let's not go backwards.

04:12.045 --> 04:13.880
What are you
so afraid will happen

04:13.963 --> 04:15.089
if you tell me the truth?

04:16.466 --> 04:17.592
Why do you want
to know so bad?

04:17.675 --> 04:19.844
Why do you even
fucking care?

04:20.929 --> 04:23.806
I don't want to
be in denial anymore.

04:24.849 --> 04:28.478
I just want to accept
what I did and move on.

04:31.898 --> 04:33.107
Fine.

04:34.984 --> 04:35.985
I'll tell ya.

04:46.704 --> 04:49.457
What's the last thing
that you remember?

04:52.418 --> 04:53.836
Popcorn.

04:54.879 --> 04:56.923
I remember the popcorn.

05:02.762 --> 05:04.722
<i>Who the fuck?</i>

05:07.850 --> 05:10.937
I'm sorry, would you mind
holding for a moment?

05:12.230 --> 05:13.481
Thanks.

05:14.482 --> 05:15.858
I'll make this quick.

05:15.942 --> 05:18.111
I'm Agent DiPierro,
FBI Cyber Crime Division.

05:18.236 --> 05:20.405
We co-opted one
of your floors.

05:20.488 --> 05:23.992
I was heading to my
station when... I see you.

05:24.075 --> 05:26.828
And it wasn't an
"Oops, wrong floor"
kind of drop-in.

05:27.078 --> 05:28.079
From where I was,
it looked like

05:28.162 --> 05:29.664
you were coming
from somewhere.

05:29.747 --> 05:32.917
Now, this is
nothing official,
so don't worry...

05:33.001 --> 05:36.462
But I just had to ask,
what were you doing
on a restricted floor?

05:39.132 --> 05:42.760
Making plans
with Agent Thomas.

05:43.261 --> 05:44.262
We were trying to decide,

05:44.345 --> 05:46.931
drinks tomorrow
or lunch today.

05:48.641 --> 05:49.809
Where'd you land?

05:51.144 --> 05:52.353
Lunch.

05:53.312 --> 05:54.814
A Greek place nearby.

05:56.649 --> 05:58.568
How do you know each other?

05:59.694 --> 06:03.406
I'm sorry,
is there something
else I can help you with?

06:03.489 --> 06:07.493
I just really have to
get back to this call
before lunch.

06:10.913 --> 06:14.459
You know, this is the honest,
"cards on the table" truth,

06:16.919 --> 06:18.963
your story fascinates me.

06:20.298 --> 06:21.632
The luck...

06:24.260 --> 06:26.554
To leave Allsafe a week before
the company gets hacked

06:26.637 --> 06:29.098
and then to end
up here at E Corp.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.394
It's ironic
given your history.

06:33.478 --> 06:35.271
<i>Okay, don't freak.
She's got nothing.</i>

06:35.354 --> 06:37.607
<i>If she did,
you'd already be busted.</i>

06:38.149 --> 06:39.192
Well, I should
quit babbling.

06:39.275 --> 06:41.778
I was gonna have you
drop by soon, anyway.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.697
Drop by? For what?

06:45.323 --> 06:48.868
Just to get a statement,
answer a few questions,
no big.

06:49.327 --> 06:53.623
I'd be happy to.
I'm just really
busy right now.

07:01.339 --> 07:03.007
Whatever this is...

07:07.720 --> 07:09.180
It's not you.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.187
<i>Okay, final command,</i>

07:16.270 --> 07:20.233
<i>ifconfig, space,
wlan1, space, up.</i>

07:29.242 --> 07:31.702
And there it is.

07:31.786 --> 07:33.121
What?

07:34.539 --> 07:36.457
We just owned the FBI.

07:53.224 --> 07:54.851
I did it, didn't I?

07:56.936 --> 07:58.563
It was either us,

08:01.607 --> 08:02.859
or him.

08:16.706 --> 08:18.332
How did I do it?

08:21.002 --> 08:22.920
Elliot...

08:23.379 --> 08:24.964
The guy was
fucking batshit.

08:26.591 --> 08:30.261
He was raving about
killing some woman

08:31.262 --> 08:33.055
and the wonder of it all.

08:33.139 --> 08:35.516
I mean, we were
gonna be next.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.019
How did I do it?

08:40.605 --> 08:42.607
After I ran the scripts,

08:44.150 --> 08:46.319
he went off on us
being gods.

08:49.155 --> 08:50.615
The popcorn,

08:52.241 --> 08:55.119
that's where Darlene
said she hid that gun.

08:55.494 --> 08:59.332
I mean,
I didn't want to, but...

09:03.878 --> 09:05.254
...I shot him.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.425
No.

09:12.845 --> 09:14.263
I shot him.

09:22.355 --> 09:23.564
Harder.

09:24.357 --> 09:25.608
Harder.

09:33.032 --> 09:34.075
Harder.

09:34.158 --> 09:36.285
<i>I told my friends
you're coming.</i>

09:39.330 --> 09:41.249
You know that can't happen.

09:41.332 --> 09:43.459
I thought this
was our celebration.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.670
We love each other.
What's to hide?

09:46.504 --> 09:48.172
Derek.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.509
I mean, how many times
do you get to turn 30?

09:52.176 --> 09:55.263
Either come to
my party tonight
as my girlfriend,

09:56.180 --> 09:57.682
or we're done.

10:04.021 --> 10:05.898
Pull up two hours ago.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.243
Last week,
any day.

10:31.549 --> 10:33.175
The entire
archive's corrupt.

10:34.010 --> 10:37.763
Call the network team.
You guys just got hacked.

10:38.723 --> 10:41.976
I'd sweep the 23rd floor
and check Angela
Moss' computer.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.144
You won't find anything.

10:43.227 --> 10:45.062
I'm sure she
erased all traces,
but check anyway.

10:46.397 --> 10:47.898
Where are you going?

10:48.649 --> 10:49.650
Fourth of July tomorrow.

10:49.734 --> 10:51.986
I'm gonna find a barbeque
to be miserable at.

11:06.125 --> 11:07.251
<i>Trash pile-ups have now</i>

11:07.335 --> 11:09.462
<i>become a real
epidemic in the city.</i>

11:09.545 --> 11:12.089
<i>Due to the credit crisis
brought on by Five/Nine,</i>

11:12.173 --> 11:15.718
<i>many private businesses
cannot afford waste
management services,</i>

11:15.801 --> 11:17.553
<i>which has sparked
a cottage industry</i>

11:17.636 --> 11:20.431
<i>of roadside garbage
burning at discounted rates.</i>

11:20.514 --> 11:21.932
<i>Due to the events
of Five/Nine,</i>

11:22.016 --> 11:23.392
<i>the Taxi and
Limousine Commission</i>

11:23.476 --> 11:26.020
<i>asks that drivers
now accept Ecoin.</i>

11:26.103 --> 11:29.106
<i>Further Commission payment
can be made via mobile phone.</i>

11:29.231 --> 11:33.027
<i>Just download the Ecoin app
from the Play Store
or App Store,</i>

11:33.110 --> 11:35.654
<i>scan the QR code
once you reach
your destination,</i>

11:35.738 --> 11:38.449
<i>and the payment
will be withdrawn
from your Ecoin Wallet.</i>

11:51.128 --> 11:52.838
You had me worried,
not answering my calls

11:52.922 --> 11:54.131
after all that went down.

11:54.215 --> 11:55.299
I'm gonna go.

11:55.383 --> 11:57.301
You weren't the target.

11:58.803 --> 11:59.845
CISCO was just trying...

11:59.970 --> 12:01.013
Stop.

12:02.598 --> 12:05.684
I know you already
put the rest together,

12:06.519 --> 12:08.604
so, no more smokescreens.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.316
Okay, ask me anything,
I'm an open book.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.693
I owe you that.

12:14.777 --> 12:18.989
You guys always thought
that you were smarter
than me.

12:19.073 --> 12:20.491
But come on.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.828
You never actually
hid it that well.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.958
Every Halloween,
when we were kids,

12:29.959 --> 12:32.628
you and Elliot always
made me watch that
shitty scary movie.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.296
It was so bad.

12:35.047 --> 12:39.009
And all these years later,
I'd kind of forgotten
about it.

12:39.844 --> 12:43.431
Even when the masks
started popping up
in those videos.

12:44.223 --> 12:46.142
I didn't place it
at first.

12:48.602 --> 12:52.857
Maybe I did.
Maybe I didn't want to.

12:54.275 --> 12:56.318
I mean, come on,

12:56.402 --> 12:58.404
that's crazy, right?

13:00.489 --> 13:02.700
That you guys would...

13:27.183 --> 13:28.434
Had enough alone
time down there

13:28.517 --> 13:29.518
to get your
head right and do

13:29.602 --> 13:31.353
what needs to be done?

13:33.355 --> 13:35.149
Speak up!

13:38.694 --> 13:39.862
Yeah.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.035
You believe him?

13:54.627 --> 13:56.086
Yeah.

14:03.177 --> 14:04.637
Okay.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.599
This is how it's gonna go.

14:17.483 --> 14:20.778
You gonna sit
your ass right here

14:21.862 --> 14:25.157
until you do
what you got to do.

14:25.241 --> 14:27.910
Once the site's up,

14:27.993 --> 14:30.788
you gonna crawl
back into your hole

14:30.871 --> 14:32.540
until we're sure
this baby's

14:32.623 --> 14:34.583
purring like a kitten.

15:02.236 --> 15:03.946
How long is
this gonna take?

15:05.281 --> 15:06.824
A few hours.

15:06.991 --> 15:08.367
Once he gets
what he wants...

15:08.450 --> 15:10.369
Right now, he needs me.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.288
So, that makes us safe.

15:53.829 --> 15:55.289
What's with the looks?

15:56.165 --> 15:57.333
Mmm.

16:10.721 --> 16:13.057
And this is
happening tomorrow?
Mmm-hmm.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.189
Hello, Derek.

16:22.358 --> 16:23.817
You never showed up.

16:26.362 --> 16:29.114
Told you what would happen
if you didn't show up.

16:29.198 --> 16:32.534
No, no, no, that's
not gonna work anymore.

16:32.618 --> 16:35.287
You've been
messing with me
for way too long.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.665
I should've known.

16:37.748 --> 16:40.376
Somebody that I met working
at a stuck-up E Corp party

16:40.459 --> 16:42.252
would be bad news.

16:42.378 --> 16:44.630
Meeting you at that party
changed something for me.

16:46.548 --> 16:49.134
I'd be lost right
now without you.

16:49.218 --> 16:52.054
What you want,
I want it, too.

16:53.889 --> 16:56.684
I was busy tonight
because I was hassling
my lawyer on holiday

16:57.559 --> 16:59.228
to do this.

17:05.109 --> 17:07.319
It's my birthday
gift to you.

17:17.496 --> 17:18.539
Holy shit.

17:19.081 --> 17:21.333
We're getting more
traffic than ever.

17:21.417 --> 17:25.254
Says our
Bitcoin intake doubled
since we've been up.

17:26.755 --> 17:29.341
200,000 we could have made
while we were down,

17:29.425 --> 17:31.385
that's on you, boy.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.471
It's time to go back
to your cage,
shit brick.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.975
What about a game?

17:38.892 --> 17:40.394
Old times' sake.

17:42.438 --> 17:43.814
Give me and Elliot
a minute.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.275
Wait outside.

18:00.289 --> 18:01.874
All right, set it up.

18:06.462 --> 18:08.005
Thank you.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.550
For what?

18:11.633 --> 18:14.970
When we first met,
I thought I was helping you.

18:15.846 --> 18:17.848
I thought I was
gonna be your savior.

18:22.478 --> 18:24.188
I didn't tell
you about my wife.

18:25.731 --> 18:27.399
She was so smart.

18:29.693 --> 18:31.028
Way smarter than me.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.072
She was like you,

18:34.740 --> 18:36.700
real good with computers.

18:36.784 --> 18:38.202
That's what she
did for a living.

18:39.244 --> 18:42.372
So, when she had
this idea to do a site,

18:42.706 --> 18:44.374
it sounded good to me.

18:47.878 --> 18:51.048
I don't think
she ever meant it
to go where it went.

18:51.590 --> 18:54.051
She was wanting to
make some extra scratch.

18:55.427 --> 18:56.970
But the thing grew so fast,

18:57.554 --> 18:59.056
it took on a life
of its own.

19:00.766 --> 19:02.226
And the money,

19:03.060 --> 19:07.022
well, we're talking
about the type of money

19:07.105 --> 19:09.107
that makes you
question right and wrong.

19:10.442 --> 19:13.070
So, you know,
we made a deal.

19:13.153 --> 19:17.950
Decided we'd let
the market dictate
what was sold on the site.

19:19.076 --> 19:20.911
And we wouldn't look.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.208
She was better at
the denial than me.

19:26.291 --> 19:30.003
It ate at me,
all the things I
imagined were going on.

19:31.255 --> 19:33.257
I feared the worst.

19:34.091 --> 19:35.759
But I still didn't look.

19:37.261 --> 19:39.263
Not until you came along.

19:49.940 --> 19:52.192
After I found out
what was on there,

19:52.276 --> 19:56.530
what we did to you,
what we did to RT,

19:56.613 --> 19:58.448
it was weak.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.661
Way back when,

20:04.162 --> 20:05.622
when I said it
was about stumbling,

20:06.123 --> 20:07.332
I was wrong.

20:14.339 --> 20:16.800
I should've taken
a fucking stand.

20:26.727 --> 20:28.478
You are my answer.

20:34.026 --> 20:36.028
It's not the
other way around.

20:39.698 --> 20:41.533
So, thank you.

21:00.761 --> 21:02.846
How much time do I have?

21:09.102 --> 21:11.146
Come on, man.

21:11.229 --> 21:13.023
We both knew exactly
what you were gonna do

21:13.106 --> 21:15.025
when I let you go
back on that computer.

21:18.236 --> 21:20.072
With their response time,
I would guess

21:20.197 --> 21:22.366
they have us
surrounded by now.

21:34.711 --> 21:37.547
You better get out before
they get up here then.

21:38.215 --> 21:41.593
<i>World champion
chess master Emanuel Lasker
once said,</i>

21:42.719 --> 21:44.721
<i>"When you see a good move,</i>

21:46.723 --> 21:48.392
<i>"look for a better one."</i>

21:58.276 --> 21:59.403
Elliot.

22:06.410 --> 22:07.911
Be careful.

22:43.113 --> 22:45.782
<i>When I completed
the migration,</i>

22:45.866 --> 22:47.242
<i>I also took it upon myself</i>

22:47.325 --> 22:50.203
<i>to open the site to
more than just Tor traffic.</i>

22:51.705 --> 22:53.874
Stay right here
and don't move.

22:53.957 --> 22:56.460
<i>Just had to index it
on a few search engines</i>

22:56.543 --> 22:59.838
<i>and with the added touch
of adverts on the top
advertising sites,</i>

22:59.963 --> 23:02.716
<i>and now it's accessible
to any average scumbag</i>

23:02.799 --> 23:05.802
<i>that googles
"Thai girls for sale."</i>

23:05.886 --> 23:07.929
<i>Didn't take long for
the FBI to catch on</i>

23:08.013 --> 23:10.640
<i>after I emailed
them an anonymous tip.</i>

23:11.308 --> 23:12.851
<i>Mr. Robot was a part of me</i>

23:12.976 --> 23:16.229
<i>that I created
because of my pain.</i>

23:16.354 --> 23:19.191
<i>So, now we have
a chance to start again.</i>

23:19.316 --> 23:22.527
<i>Our handshake
negotiated us as partners.</i>

23:31.078 --> 23:32.579
The House will
come to order.

23:41.379 --> 23:45.175
<i>There has been
much mystery surrounding
the vandalism and castration</i>

23:45.258 --> 23:46.927
<i>of the Wall Street Bull.</i>

23:47.010 --> 23:50.388
<i>That mystery was solved
when the missing
anatomy of the Bull</i>

23:50.514 --> 23:52.849
<i>crashed through a skylight
of the House chamber.</i>

23:52.933 --> 23:56.186
<i>Police, FBI, and
the Department of
Homeland Security</i>

23:56.269 --> 23:58.021
<i>have begun
a full-fledged manhunt</i>

23:58.105 --> 23:59.856
<i>for those parties
responsible.</i>

24:01.441 --> 24:03.026
You haven't answered
my calls since the weekend.

24:04.027 --> 24:05.362
As you can see,
it's busy.

24:06.738 --> 24:08.573
Ever since this
bailout fiasco yesterday,

24:08.698 --> 24:10.742
these kits are
flying off the shelves.

24:10.867 --> 24:12.953
The end of civilization
is near,

24:13.036 --> 24:15.080
so this is
gonna have to wait.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.541
I can settle the lawsuit.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.628
Stay out of that.

24:21.711 --> 24:22.838
The lawyers are handling it.

24:22.921 --> 24:24.381
E Corp will settle.

24:24.548 --> 24:28.176
But there's a contingency
with the independent
inspections.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.219
If we drop it...

24:29.302 --> 24:30.470
I'm not discussing this
with you.

24:30.595 --> 24:32.681
If you drop the
independent inspections,

24:32.764 --> 24:33.890
they will settle.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.309
Did your boss
put you up to this?

24:39.980 --> 24:42.065
Look at what's happening.

24:43.441 --> 24:44.985
Who knows if this
company will be around

24:45.068 --> 24:48.238
long enough to see
this case through?

24:48.613 --> 24:50.991
Drop the contingency.
You'll get your money.

24:51.074 --> 24:52.742
The inspections are
there for a reason.

24:53.618 --> 24:57.164
Do you want what
happened to your mom
to happen again?

24:57.247 --> 24:59.749
I'll make sure
the inspections
go forward internally.

25:01.293 --> 25:03.253
Is that how
they're suckering you?

25:04.171 --> 25:05.839
Trust me,
they value me over there.

25:10.427 --> 25:14.681
You laugh,
but they respect me.

25:17.267 --> 25:20.228
I don't know
who this person is
who's in front of me,

25:20.312 --> 25:22.856
but I'm not
agreeing to any of this.

25:23.356 --> 25:25.108
I don't trust them.

25:26.109 --> 25:27.694
And to be honest?

25:28.278 --> 25:29.696
I don't trust you.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.199
Besides, you think
anyone else is gonna

25:32.324 --> 25:34.284
wanna sign on to
whatever you're selling?

25:34.367 --> 25:38.330
It's not just my vote,
it's the whole class.

25:38.455 --> 25:39.831
You need 2/3.

25:39.956 --> 25:41.875
I already got
the signatures.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.297
That's the trick
about money.

25:48.131 --> 25:51.051
Banks care more about
it than anything else.

25:54.054 --> 25:56.389
What exactly is
in this for you?

25:57.682 --> 25:59.976
You aren't getting
the money. I am.

26:00.310 --> 26:02.062
You know that, right?

26:02.187 --> 26:03.563
So, I'll ask you
one more time.

26:04.064 --> 26:06.149
Why did you come here?

26:06.233 --> 26:09.819
Because you certainly
didn't give a shit
about my opinion.

26:11.821 --> 26:13.823
This was just a courtesy.

26:31.508 --> 26:34.261
This Ray thing got
everyone talking.

26:40.183 --> 26:42.519
I didn't have
anything to do with that.

26:44.688 --> 26:46.731
Lying ain't your
friend right now, cuz.

26:48.066 --> 26:49.442
Everyone got
their eyes on you.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.365
Half of them love you.

26:56.283 --> 26:58.535
Half of them
want to kill you.

26:59.369 --> 27:02.247
Other half just want
to twist your shit up.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.376
But you know,
it's that last half

27:06.459 --> 27:08.920
I'm worried
about for you, bro.

27:09.713 --> 27:12.882
Hey, little man,
book it real quick
for me.

27:18.722 --> 27:20.223
I'm good here.

27:23.059 --> 27:25.145
What's that?
Didn't hear you.

27:25.562 --> 27:27.063
You heard.

27:36.489 --> 27:40.910
Fucking bravery
is contagious.

27:45.790 --> 27:48.335
I suggest you
talk to your boy.

27:49.586 --> 27:51.421
He's fine where he is.

27:53.465 --> 27:55.216
Ray's site.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.886
I had 800 Bitcoins
in my Wallet.

27:57.969 --> 28:00.347
Now, all of a sudden,
I got no access.

28:00.472 --> 28:03.683
Can't even make new sales
'cause the site's down.

28:05.268 --> 28:07.103
All of this
is on you.

28:07.187 --> 28:08.605
So, the way I see it,

28:09.147 --> 28:10.357
you're paying me back.

28:18.490 --> 28:21.284
We'll get some
one-on-one later on.

28:36.841 --> 28:38.551
Just remember, cuz,

28:39.677 --> 28:42.222
sitting under
the Sword of Damocles.

28:48.561 --> 28:51.648
Out of the blue,
I received a call
from my lawyer.

28:52.232 --> 28:55.402
Seems the contingency
on our biggest lawsuit

28:55.485 --> 28:57.529
was miraculously dropped.

28:58.696 --> 29:00.323
Care to explain?

29:01.491 --> 29:02.992
It's what
you wanted, isn't it?

29:04.077 --> 29:07.372
I remember telling you
exactly the opposite.

29:07.497 --> 29:09.999
You just didn't
want to ask for it.

29:12.043 --> 29:13.503
But it is what you wanted.

29:16.339 --> 29:19.050
You gonna
take the offer then?

29:21.428 --> 29:25.515
Well, it's not for
me to say, officially,

29:27.350 --> 29:30.270
but despite the fact that
we're hemorrhaging
money at the moment,

29:30.895 --> 29:32.230
settling this
would be a lot cheaper

29:32.355 --> 29:36.317
than dealing with
the legal expense.

29:36.401 --> 29:40.738
Can I ask why it was
so important for you
to drop this contingency?

29:46.911 --> 29:50.540
You protecting some evil,
secret agenda?

29:53.042 --> 29:57.464
Don't we all protect
our evil, secret agendas?

30:04.429 --> 30:06.806
In that case,
here's mine.

30:07.807 --> 30:09.100
One of the things
that Terry Colby

30:09.225 --> 30:10.977
said to me when
I took this job

30:11.144 --> 30:13.646
was I could make
changes from within.

30:16.941 --> 30:20.320
I want my position
moved to the Risk
Management Department.

30:20.653 --> 30:22.655
There's a manager
position available.

30:22.739 --> 30:24.407
And even though I may
lack the experience,

30:24.574 --> 30:26.576
I think you know
I can more than
make up for it

30:26.659 --> 30:29.078
with drive
and quick learning.

30:29.496 --> 30:31.206
That's how you
choose to squander

30:31.289 --> 30:33.917
the capital
you've just earned...

30:34.000 --> 30:36.836
You're aware
that's a lateral move?

30:36.920 --> 30:38.338
It's what I want.

30:51.184 --> 30:52.769
And I am asking.

31:01.986 --> 31:03.863
It's my birthday today.

31:05.949 --> 31:07.617
Did you know that?

31:09.452 --> 31:10.870
No.

31:12.372 --> 31:13.623
I thought...
No, no.

31:13.790 --> 31:14.999
Don't believe
what you read online.

31:15.124 --> 31:18.545
Today is my
actual birthday.

31:20.213 --> 31:22.632
I never share
the real one with anyone.

31:22.715 --> 31:25.468
Some things I like
to keep to myself.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.392
Happy birthday then.

31:41.317 --> 31:45.071
Would you like to
celebrate with me?

31:47.365 --> 31:48.700
Tonight?

31:54.706 --> 31:55.748
No.

32:06.843 --> 32:08.720
Well, maybe next year.

32:12.265 --> 32:16.185
<i>"Whither thou
goest to possess them,
and thou succeedest them,</i>

32:16.853 --> 32:18.938
"and dwellest
in their land."

32:21.357 --> 32:22.358
Amen.

32:22.525 --> 32:23.526
Amen.

32:41.711 --> 32:44.047
I wanted to
tell you I'm sorry.

32:45.548 --> 32:47.550
For my outburst last month.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.228
Can you let go
of me, please?

33:02.231 --> 33:04.067
I know you're afraid,

33:05.735 --> 33:08.321
but the fear you
have is a right one.

33:08.738 --> 33:11.240
It means you'll be
forever vigilant.

33:13.159 --> 33:15.286
You want to know
how I know?

33:17.580 --> 33:19.582
I've seen you
talking to him.

33:20.833 --> 33:23.503
Not out loud,
but I could tell.

33:23.753 --> 33:25.922
It's written all
over your face.

33:27.090 --> 33:31.344
It's not crazy,
Elliot, it's very normal.

33:33.596 --> 33:35.431
You've seen me
talking to him?

33:35.515 --> 33:37.350
Yes.

33:37.767 --> 33:39.936
But you don't have to
keep it such a secret.

33:42.605 --> 33:45.608
When you let
Jesus into your heart,

33:46.818 --> 33:48.611
he'll always listen.

33:54.450 --> 33:55.993
Tell you what,

33:57.036 --> 33:58.121
I'll give you
some alone time.

34:35.825 --> 34:37.493
I need your help.

34:40.079 --> 34:42.665
I've been lost
these past few weeks.

34:43.166 --> 34:45.168
Since the whole Ray thing.

34:45.877 --> 34:49.005
I need to finish what I
started with Evil Corp.

34:50.506 --> 34:52.675
But I don't know
what to do.

35:08.274 --> 35:11.027
Why did you first
start listening to me?

35:15.114 --> 35:18.534
When I sent you that note
on the server at Evil Corp,

35:20.745 --> 35:25.374
something inside you
told you to listen
and you did.

35:27.376 --> 35:30.880
Followed me off the subway,
came to fsociety,

35:31.631 --> 35:35.885
and then you, not me,
led us to hack Evil Corp.

35:38.554 --> 35:40.723
I didn't force
you to do any of it.

35:41.265 --> 35:44.268
It was all you.
Your choice.

35:44.936 --> 35:46.229
Truth is,

35:47.146 --> 35:49.065
I just followed
your lead.

35:55.112 --> 35:57.406
People want to
follow you, son.

36:00.117 --> 36:01.619
Why?

36:01.744 --> 36:05.456
Same reason why you
led the entire world
into a revolution.

36:06.833 --> 36:09.335
Because you are a leader.

36:15.299 --> 36:17.093
I don't want to
be a leader.

36:19.804 --> 36:21.347
You asked me
how to finish this.

36:21.597 --> 36:23.599
That's what
you need to do.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.643
You need to lead.

36:31.148 --> 36:34.318
And not unlike your floor,
coffee machine, file room.

36:34.443 --> 36:35.570
People in this bullpen,
these are

36:35.653 --> 36:37.029
your risk management
coordinators,

36:37.113 --> 36:38.531
you'll be
working with this team.

36:38.614 --> 36:40.616
Put out risk reports,
analyses,

36:40.783 --> 36:42.451
and you report
everything out to me.

36:42.535 --> 36:45.162
After Five/Nine,
almost all of our time

36:45.288 --> 36:49.417
is dedicated to helping
the crisis response team.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.335
That's what we do here.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.296
Our internal
investigation team

36:53.379 --> 36:55.423
make recommendations
to management

36:55.506 --> 36:59.510
about ways to
address the crisis
and course correct.

37:00.636 --> 37:01.679
Need you to be smart.

37:02.305 --> 37:04.974
Think outside the box
and be discreet.

37:05.141 --> 37:09.061
You get in, you get out,
assess the situation quickly,
find answers,

37:09.353 --> 37:11.689
figure out ways
to limit damage.

37:13.691 --> 37:17.069
I'm giving you access
to the case we're
working on now.

37:18.029 --> 37:23.034
It's a class action
lawsuit brewing in Flint
over water contamination.

37:24.493 --> 37:29.373
Nothing public yet,
but could be big
first quarter, 2016.

37:29.498 --> 37:31.709
Do I just go
into the file server
to access that?

37:31.834 --> 37:35.046
I'll have IT run you
through everything.

37:35.171 --> 37:37.757
Set up Outlook, Calendar.

37:40.343 --> 37:42.178
You knew Gideon Goddard?

37:43.012 --> 37:45.848
We worked together
on a couple projects
when he was a vendor.

37:46.599 --> 37:48.684
It's terrible
what happened to him.

37:50.019 --> 37:52.772
Well, why don't you go ahead
and get yourself up to speed?

37:52.855 --> 37:54.523
I'll check in once a week.

37:55.524 --> 37:56.901
Let me know
if you need anything.

38:06.285 --> 38:09.038
Can I sit in on
the daily debrief meeting?

38:11.582 --> 38:15.044
Look, that's
a director-level meeting.

38:15.127 --> 38:16.754
We don't really
invite managers to that.

38:16.837 --> 38:18.255
If I could just
sit and listen,

38:18.339 --> 38:20.091
it might help me get
up to speed faster.

38:20.174 --> 38:23.636
I want to make sure
I can add value
as soon as possible.

38:24.595 --> 38:27.473
All right.
It's later this afternoon.

38:27.556 --> 38:30.142
I'll send you
an invite with the details.

38:33.145 --> 38:35.022
Did you get in
okay this morning

38:35.106 --> 38:37.692
with these
protestors out here?

38:40.695 --> 38:42.029
It's crazy, right?

38:51.956 --> 38:55.543
<i>I was on a route
to cure myself
of Mr. Robot.</i>

38:55.626 --> 38:58.838
<i>The regimen was
supposed to be that path.</i>

39:00.798 --> 39:02.967
<i>I never thought the regimen
would be the thing</i>

39:03.050 --> 39:06.053
<i>that would lead me
right back where I started.</i>

39:07.847 --> 39:09.265
<i>People always
told me growing up</i>

39:09.348 --> 39:12.059
<i>that it's never
about the destination.</i>

39:12.143 --> 39:14.562
<i>It's about the journey.</i>

39:14.645 --> 39:17.189
<i>But what if
the destination is you?</i>

39:18.941 --> 39:20.943
<i>What if it's always you?</i>

39:28.826 --> 39:30.327
Hey!

39:30.619 --> 39:32.204
Help!

39:36.751 --> 39:38.169
I learned you got
a problem.

39:38.252 --> 39:39.879
You want to know
what your problem is?

39:39.962 --> 39:42.339
Too much courage.
Just like your nigger friend.

39:42.423 --> 39:44.800
People might tell
you it's a good thing,
but it ain't always.

39:44.884 --> 39:46.552
It makes you have
errors in judgment.

39:47.762 --> 39:49.597
But I'm gonna
do you a solid.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.849
I'm gonna fix that
courage problem of yours.

40:00.608 --> 40:03.444
We're gonna break
that brave, little soul
of yours, homey.

40:04.904 --> 40:07.448
You could've
avoided this if you'd
just given me my money.

40:07.531 --> 40:09.116
Think about that.

40:09.366 --> 40:10.951
Think about it.

40:12.161 --> 40:13.871
Think about it.

40:15.039 --> 40:16.624
No, no!

40:34.809 --> 40:37.103
Gonna get a letter
on Tuesday.

40:38.354 --> 40:39.980
Do what it says.

40:51.492 --> 40:52.743
Hey, yo, man,

40:52.827 --> 40:54.578
when you see Whiterose,

40:57.498 --> 40:59.667
make sure you say
I did you good.

41:09.426 --> 41:11.637
I'll be rooting
for you, cuz.

41:12.680 --> 41:13.848
Always.

41:31.991 --> 41:33.200
Usually, they feed us.

41:33.534 --> 41:35.286
It's one of the only reasons
to come to these meetings.

41:35.369 --> 41:37.872
Should we go ahead and start?
It doesn't look like
Susan's gonna make it.

41:37.955 --> 41:39.957
Is there any reason
to have this meeting
without her?

41:40.040 --> 41:41.917
The economy must
really be in the shitter

41:42.001 --> 41:44.962
if Susan Jacobs
finally decided
to take her vacation days.

41:46.130 --> 41:47.173
First order of business

41:47.256 --> 41:49.717
is the small independent
loan companies
we're servicing.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.093
I'm surprised
they're not suing us

41:51.177 --> 41:52.428
for breach of
the uptime clauses.

41:52.511 --> 41:55.181
I have three class actions
on that point alone
in my region.

41:55.264 --> 41:57.141
Contractual damages
on uptime are minimal

41:57.224 --> 41:58.642
I'm not even
worried about it.

41:58.726 --> 42:02.188
We'll settle.
But we should discuss that
when Susan comes back.

42:02.271 --> 42:04.690
Maybe it would be helpful
if I put together a summary

42:04.773 --> 42:07.860
of how we've
handled past cases.

42:07.943 --> 42:09.320
To see if there
are any patterns

42:09.403 --> 42:12.072
that might help us
figure out how to
address this issue.

42:14.575 --> 42:16.368
If we pull
milestone cases

42:16.452 --> 42:19.705
like Dakota Fracking and
Washington Township,

42:20.456 --> 42:23.125
I could put together
a summary briefing.

42:27.546 --> 42:29.340
All I would need is
access to the files

42:29.423 --> 42:32.551
and I could get
working on that right away.

42:48.067 --> 42:49.235
You know what?

42:49.610 --> 42:52.696
There's not much
we can do here today.

42:52.780 --> 42:54.949
Food never came,
Susan's out.

42:55.908 --> 42:56.951
Let's adjourn.

42:57.117 --> 42:58.452
Didn't I just say
that two minutes ago?

42:58.535 --> 42:59.954
We're really
leaving before the food?

43:00.037 --> 43:01.664
I said adjourned.

43:18.347 --> 43:19.890
I know who you are.

43:21.517 --> 43:24.311
You did what you did
to get a job here.

43:24.395 --> 43:26.689
You sucked whoever's dick
to get transferred here.

43:26.772 --> 43:29.149
And, frankly,
I don't really care.

43:31.735 --> 43:34.029
This is a favor to Price.

43:35.030 --> 43:36.323
You know
what he told me,

43:36.615 --> 43:39.326
when I asked him
how I should deal with you?

43:40.911 --> 43:44.456
He said, and I quote,
"However you want."

43:54.591 --> 43:56.635
Enjoy the shrimp cocktail.

44:00.139 --> 44:02.641
This is good news,
don't you think?

44:11.817 --> 44:13.944
But you're not
happy about it.

44:16.822 --> 44:18.324
I'm not sure.

44:19.992 --> 44:21.493
When did you get it?

44:23.454 --> 44:24.997
This morning.

44:28.792 --> 44:31.003
How are your
interactions with him?

44:33.547 --> 44:37.468
For the first time,
we trust each other.

44:38.302 --> 44:40.429
I help him,
and he helps me.

44:43.515 --> 44:44.975
Since I've been
at my mom's,

44:45.059 --> 44:47.061
I wanted to
get rid of him.

44:48.354 --> 44:50.064
But you were right.

44:52.107 --> 44:54.735
You can't destroy
a part of yourself.

45:02.159 --> 45:04.370
Elliot, I need to
ask you a question.

45:08.165 --> 45:10.751
Where do you think
you are right now?

45:14.463 --> 45:16.131
What do you mean?

45:21.428 --> 45:22.596
Elliot,

45:25.432 --> 45:28.435
you know you haven't
been staying with
your mother, right?

45:30.938 --> 45:32.106
I know.

45:49.123 --> 45:53.502
When you get released,
I hope you continue
seeing me in my office.

45:55.462 --> 45:58.215
I think it's important
we maintain our
regular schedule.

45:58.966 --> 46:00.551
Don't you agree?

46:02.678 --> 46:03.804
Yes.

46:16.108 --> 46:18.735
<i>Control can
sometimes be an illusion.</i>

46:20.154 --> 46:24.074
<i>But sometimes
you need illusion
to gain control.</i>

46:31.331 --> 46:34.668
<i>Fantasy is an easy way
to give meaning to the world,</i>

46:35.669 --> 46:38.839
<i>to cloak our harsh reality
in escapist comfort.</i>

46:41.967 --> 46:43.302
<i>After all,</i>

46:43.677 --> 46:47.306
<i>isn't that why we
surround ourselves
with so many screens?</i>

46:49.266 --> 46:53.770
<i>So we can avoid seeing?
So we can avoid each other.</i>

46:53.854 --> 46:57.107
I don't think I'm ready
to talk about it just yet.

46:57.733 --> 46:59.610
<i>So we can
avoid truth.</i>

47:02.571 --> 47:05.407
<i>I'm sorry for not
telling you everything.</i>

47:06.950 --> 47:09.786
<i>But I needed this
in order to get better.</i>

47:14.041 --> 47:16.335
<i>Please don't be mad
too long.</i>

47:16.418 --> 47:19.713
<i>This will be the last time
I keep things from you.</i>

47:19.796 --> 47:21.507
<i>I promise.</i>

47:41.443 --> 47:43.362
<i>I know what
you're thinking,</i>

47:44.363 --> 47:45.864
<i>and, no, I didn't
lie to you.</i>

47:46.907 --> 47:48.992
See you in the morning.

47:49.076 --> 47:50.494
<i>All of this
really happened.</i>

47:51.203 --> 47:53.997
<i>This was just my
way of coping with it.</i>

47:54.081 --> 47:57.709
<i>But now, I'd like it
if we could trust
each other again.</i>

47:58.835 --> 48:00.045
<i>Let's shake on it.</i>
