WEBVTT

00:01.276 --> 00:04.091
Ten years ago, our ship
crash-landed on Earth...

00:04.123 --> 00:06.200
we came here seeking refuge,

00:06.219 --> 00:08.686
but the Humans thought
that it was an invasion.

00:10.768 --> 00:13.703
That night, I met a human
girl who tried to protect me,

00:13.709 --> 00:15.875
a girl I never thought I'd see again.

00:16.161 --> 00:18.746
The surviving members
of my race, the Atrians,

00:18.808 --> 00:21.949
were rounded up and isolated
inside a militarized sector.

00:21.951 --> 00:23.852
Now it's 2024.

00:23.869 --> 00:25.804
Seven of us have been
chosen to attend high school

00:25.838 --> 00:28.119
as a part of a government
integration program,

00:28.137 --> 00:31.316
but the humans and Atrians
continue to distrust each other,

00:31.666 --> 00:33.637
while I fight to protect my people

00:33.693 --> 00:37.087
and the human girl who
saved my life at any cost.

00:37.562 --> 00:39.465
Previously on Star-Crossed...

00:39.534 --> 00:41.517
This program is the first step

00:41.573 --> 00:43.262
toward unifying our races.

00:43.268 --> 00:45.177
Dad, they're never gonna
treat us like equals.

00:45.191 --> 00:46.548
I have faith in them.

00:46.942 --> 00:47.980
Keep these guys back.

00:48.005 --> 00:49.701
Oh, my God, it's your dad.

00:51.190 --> 00:53.063
You're going home?

00:53.065 --> 00:54.648
The chemo isn't working.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:10.510 --> 01:12.663
How could you let my son go out there?

01:12.668 --> 01:13.884
Let me see your hands.

01:15.338 --> 01:16.686
Wait! No!

02:01.961 --> 02:03.600
Come on. You know the drill.

02:06.466 --> 02:07.521
Hey.

02:07.699 --> 02:09.363
You need a license to sell.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.110
Hey!

02:20.160 --> 02:21.656
It's all clear.

02:55.554 --> 02:57.317
Police are investigating an attack

02:57.323 --> 02:59.776
at the sector by a
militant group of Atrians.

02:59.789 --> 03:02.162
Officials believe they're
seeking retribution

03:02.205 --> 03:04.608
for the death of Atrian
leader and activist, Nox,

03:04.658 --> 03:06.836
who was killed two days ago by a guard.

03:06.867 --> 03:08.043
I can't stand this.

03:08.451 --> 03:10.082
My dad isn't a murderer.

03:10.202 --> 03:12.119
He didn't mean to kill Roman's dad.

03:12.239 --> 03:13.370
It was an accident.

03:14.055 --> 03:15.906
You have to stop watching that.

03:16.782 --> 03:18.465
I'll just have to tell him, "look,

03:18.478 --> 03:21.343
Roman, I know things are
complicated right now, but

03:21.362 --> 03:23.376
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you

03:23.395 --> 03:25.716
- and if you want to talk or..."
- Em,

03:25.723 --> 03:27.149
I know you care about Roman

03:27.186 --> 03:29.282
and want to find a way
to ease his pain, but...

03:29.557 --> 03:31.388
I don't think it's gonna be that simple.

03:33.055 --> 03:35.425
I'm sorry. We...

03:36.071 --> 03:38.799
haven't even properly celebrated you

03:38.824 --> 03:40.388
kicking cancer's ass.

03:40.407 --> 03:41.984
All in due time, my friend.

03:44.824 --> 03:46.870
I wish you were coming to school with me.

03:46.908 --> 03:48.122
In a few days.

03:48.124 --> 03:50.187
Doc Benson wants to run some more tests.

03:50.762 --> 03:52.746
I don't know if you've heard, but...

03:52.866 --> 03:54.166
I'm kind of a miracle.

03:58.878 --> 04:00.384
It's so strange.

04:00.386 --> 04:02.132
All I remember from that night

04:02.175 --> 04:03.902
is a dream about...

04:04.177 --> 04:07.936
a blue angel who came into
my hospital room and cured me.

04:08.144 --> 04:10.094
Freaky, huh?

04:11.346 --> 04:12.846
Yeah.

04:15.413 --> 04:17.634
Why do we have to crush the cyper?

04:18.596 --> 04:21.625
Dad said it releases
the higunu of the plant.

04:22.420 --> 04:23.834
Its energy.

04:24.165 --> 04:26.160
It's part of the ritual for dad's ceremony.

04:26.162 --> 04:29.026
There's so much I always wanted to ask him,

04:29.058 --> 04:30.315
but I never got the chance.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.987
I don't even know how cyper is grown.

04:33.018 --> 04:35.169
Or why we have to keep it a secret.

04:35.171 --> 04:36.703
Self-preservation.

04:36.705 --> 04:39.682
If humans ever learned of
the curative capabilities

04:39.695 --> 04:42.429
of combining an Atrian's blood and cyper,

04:42.660 --> 04:44.787
our tribesmen would all become lab rats.

04:44.819 --> 04:46.283
If there's anything you want to know,

04:46.326 --> 04:48.097
you could always ask your Uncle Castor.

04:48.133 --> 04:50.551
- Have things calmed down outside?
- For now.

04:50.553 --> 04:52.286
Luckily, no guards were killed.

04:52.406 --> 04:55.218
But I suspect more attacks
by the Trags will follow.

04:55.286 --> 04:56.794
Why are they doing this?

04:56.914 --> 04:59.443
Not a single human was punished
for your father's death.

04:59.445 --> 05:01.449
The Trags are sending
a message to our people

05:01.468 --> 05:02.778
that we are not powerless,

05:02.898 --> 05:05.691
that by joining them is the
only way to achieve freedom.

05:05.811 --> 05:07.868
So they're exploiting my father's death

05:07.887 --> 05:09.501
as a recruitment strategy.

05:14.505 --> 05:17.114
Roman, Castor's taking over preparations

05:17.133 --> 05:19.195
for your father's ogmon.

05:20.756 --> 05:21.907
This is my duty.

05:22.027 --> 05:23.333
There is much to do,

05:23.335 --> 05:25.802
- and you have school.
- I don't have to go.

05:26.721 --> 05:28.972
We should start preparing the soil.

05:38.051 --> 05:40.017
The only time Castor
used to come by to see us

05:40.072 --> 05:41.586
was to pick a fight with dad.

05:42.377 --> 05:44.098
Now he's so eager to be involved.

05:44.592 --> 05:46.240
Just give him a chance.

05:47.617 --> 05:50.817
It has been a trying couple
of days for our community.

05:51.305 --> 05:52.908
Our counselors are available to you

05:52.926 --> 05:54.509
should you need to speak with someone.

05:54.629 --> 05:56.749
I know you may have
concerns, but I assure you

05:56.780 --> 05:59.564
your safety and well-being
remain our highest priority.

05:59.602 --> 06:01.009
And how do we know one of them doesn't try

06:01.035 --> 06:02.092
to blow up the school next?

06:02.117 --> 06:03.431
The school board is meeting today

06:03.468 --> 06:05.533
to discuss heightening security measures,

06:05.777 --> 06:07.835
as well as whether or not to move forward

06:07.860 --> 06:09.734
with tomorrow night's homecoming carnival.

06:11.776 --> 06:13.478
I am all for equality,

06:13.598 --> 06:15.661
but when they start messing with tradition,

06:15.781 --> 06:17.657
that's when I go turbo bitch.

06:17.713 --> 06:20.504
- I mean, is nothing sacred?
- You guys murdered our leader,

06:20.560 --> 06:23.044
and you're worried about
cancelling some weird ritual

06:23.100 --> 06:24.339
where you celebrate, what,

06:24.351 --> 06:25.409
going home?

06:25.811 --> 06:27.845
I would celebrate you going home.

06:27.847 --> 06:29.788
Hey, Em.

06:30.219 --> 06:32.403
Your dad doing okay?

06:32.948 --> 06:34.099
It's hard to say.

06:34.606 --> 06:37.265
Any time I ask him about it,
he just changes the subject.

06:37.666 --> 06:39.605
Hey, your dad's a hero.

06:40.362 --> 06:41.495
Nox would've killed that guard

06:41.507 --> 06:42.627
if your dad hadn't shot him.

06:42.646 --> 06:44.629
I don't think that's how it happened.

06:44.817 --> 06:46.975
I think she lost all credibility

06:46.994 --> 06:48.733
the second she took off into the woods

06:48.853 --> 06:50.253
- with a tattie.
- Hey.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.224
Just give it a rest.

06:59.330 --> 07:00.675
Roman.

07:02.245 --> 07:03.882
You won't even talk to me now?

07:04.002 --> 07:05.017
I can't.

07:05.048 --> 07:06.337
It was an accident.

07:06.574 --> 07:08.086
Roman, it was an accident.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.684
- I am so sorry.
- Why?

07:09.709 --> 07:12.130
Because my father's dead? Or
because your father shot him?

07:13.963 --> 07:15.890
Because you're in pain.

07:19.351 --> 07:21.591
Will you at least let me thank you?

07:24.375 --> 07:25.595
For what?

07:30.394 --> 07:33.000
I found this in Julia's hospital room.

07:33.463 --> 07:35.202
You saved her life.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.261
She probably swiped it
as a souvenir when you two

07:37.280 --> 07:38.643
broke into the sector last week.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.902
- No, she would've told me if she had.
- It didn't happen.

07:41.647 --> 07:43.523
Just... please,

07:43.525 --> 07:44.958
let it go.

07:49.013 --> 07:51.520
We're from two different worlds, Emery.

07:52.859 --> 07:55.737
We can't keep pretending
like that doesn't matter.

07:56.694 --> 07:59.628
It only matters if we let it.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.100
Roman.

08:02.312 --> 08:04.665
Let's go. Bus is leaving.

08:05.063 --> 08:06.945
Time to get back to the sector.

08:08.867 --> 08:09.976
Yeah.

08:10.402 --> 08:12.367
Thanks, Beaumont.

08:12.780 --> 08:14.707
You all right, Emery?

08:15.445 --> 08:17.873
Yeah.

08:18.205 --> 08:19.594
Your dad's gonna be okay.

08:19.650 --> 08:21.545
We're all supporting him.

08:22.559 --> 08:23.785
Thank you.

08:23.905 --> 08:26.037
Good evening. I'm ray Whitehill.

08:26.075 --> 08:27.433
I will be taking

08:27.458 --> 08:30.179
a temporary leave of
absence from the force,

08:30.354 --> 08:32.876
but my colleague, officer Jack Beaumont,

08:32.996 --> 08:34.916
will be speaking on behalf of the SEU

08:34.947 --> 08:36.717
about last night's attack.

08:40.403 --> 08:42.655
In order to prevent another incident,

08:42.668 --> 08:45.120
we will be conducting
unscheduled pod searches.

08:45.133 --> 08:47.272
But what about the safety
of our kids in school?

08:47.285 --> 08:48.604
Each of the Atrian seven

08:48.629 --> 08:50.622
submit to a security scan before entering.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.884
Though we remind you the
seven are not to blame

08:52.902 --> 08:54.060
for last night's attack.

08:54.104 --> 08:55.949
This has been a difficult few days.

08:55.956 --> 08:57.094
For all of us.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.247
But we must now focus

08:59.251 --> 09:01.334
on healing relations between our races.

09:01.544 --> 09:03.852
Now, let's not forget
that this program presents

09:03.890 --> 09:05.529
a unique opportunity

09:05.723 --> 09:07.055
for not only our kids

09:07.074 --> 09:08.974
but for society as a whole

09:09.094 --> 09:10.127
to interact with

09:10.171 --> 09:13.287
- and learn from the Atrians.
- I know what I want to learn.

09:14.657 --> 09:17.266
How they plan to colonize our planet.

09:17.704 --> 09:20.225
'Cause we all know that's
what they're really here for.

09:20.238 --> 09:22.466
Mr. Vartan, you've made your views

09:22.507 --> 09:24.043
and those of your fellow Red Hawks

09:24.068 --> 09:25.694
very clear at these meetings.

09:25.738 --> 09:27.453
However, the government has no reason

09:27.465 --> 09:28.829
- to believe...
- What about the rumors

09:28.864 --> 09:30.014
that some of these tatties

09:30.018 --> 09:32.314
have learned how to remove their markings

09:32.339 --> 09:35.186
and embed themselves in our society?

09:35.236 --> 09:36.387
And our government.

09:36.406 --> 09:38.953
We're here to discuss
the integration program,

09:39.234 --> 09:41.180
not conspiracy theories.

09:41.424 --> 09:43.044
Who is that guy?

09:43.862 --> 09:45.384
Robert Vartan.

09:45.578 --> 09:46.911
Veteran red hawk.

09:47.031 --> 09:50.158
"And God said, let us
make man in our image,"

09:52.291 --> 09:54.380
"And let them have dominion over every

09:54.412 --> 09:56.820
creeping thing that creeps upon the Earth."

09:56.842 --> 09:58.384
Mr. Vartan, please take a seat.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.123
What about the homecoming carnival?

10:00.155 --> 10:01.481
Ms. Garcia and I have discussed it

10:01.494 --> 10:03.509
and we believe the community
should not be deprived

10:03.534 --> 10:05.223
of one of its most valued traditions.

10:05.273 --> 10:07.350
I... I think the board
should vote on the issue.

10:12.355 --> 10:14.169
All those in favor

10:14.213 --> 10:17.310
of the Atrian seven
attending homecoming carnival

10:17.430 --> 10:18.931
raise your hand.

10:30.388 --> 10:32.246
So it's settled then.

10:32.621 --> 10:34.561
The Atrian seven will not be permitted

10:34.580 --> 10:36.025
to attend the carnival.

10:36.057 --> 10:37.526
So, if there are any other issues...

10:37.564 --> 10:39.115
You don't even know them!

10:41.294 --> 10:43.496
The Atrian seven aren't terrorists.

10:43.715 --> 10:44.841
They're teenagers.

10:44.891 --> 10:47.094
Little girl, please. You don't
know what you're talking about.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.428
Hey, watch it. That's my daughter.

10:49.548 --> 10:51.405
You say you want to learn from them,

10:51.442 --> 10:54.226
but you won't even allow
them to come to our carnival?

10:54.527 --> 10:56.047
How can they learn to trust us

10:56.079 --> 10:58.318
when we don't give them reason to?

10:58.894 --> 11:00.787
Yeah, she's right.

11:02.457 --> 11:03.957
Any comment?

11:03.959 --> 11:06.493
How are you coping with
your father's death?

11:06.495 --> 11:08.679
Do you blame the guard?

11:09.131 --> 11:11.839
Do you have any idea who was
behind last night's attack?

11:12.014 --> 11:13.950
The guards must be bracing for riots.

11:13.952 --> 11:15.343
That's not all they're worried about.

11:15.355 --> 11:18.353
I heard the Trags used the attack on
the guards' booth as a distraction.

11:19.547 --> 11:21.903
A distraction? For what?

11:21.909 --> 11:24.550
- Steal a cache of the guards' weapons.
- Roman?

11:27.184 --> 11:29.780
The hwatab... they want to see you.

11:31.300 --> 11:32.986
Come.

11:42.779 --> 11:45.869
Roman, these are the
elders of the four tribes...

11:45.907 --> 11:47.721
the Vwasak, the Iwabas,

11:48.003 --> 11:49.918
the Swamad, and, our tribe,

11:50.038 --> 11:51.438
the Zwahan.

11:51.632 --> 11:54.147
_

11:54.454 --> 11:57.210
I'm sorry. My sondiv is a little rusty.

11:57.212 --> 11:59.472
My father encouraged us to speak English.

11:59.948 --> 12:03.289
Your father was a very progressive iksen.

12:03.409 --> 12:05.235
He had big plans for you.

12:12.261 --> 12:15.389
Many of our people still
believe in Nox's message

12:15.509 --> 12:17.753
that justice, peace and
equality can be attained

12:17.785 --> 12:19.718
using non-violent means.

12:19.943 --> 12:22.296
But we fear the Trags
are growing in number.

12:22.340 --> 12:24.123
We fear war with the humans

12:24.142 --> 12:26.626
- could be on the horizon.
- We've called on you

12:26.682 --> 12:28.703
because, as Nox's firstborn child

12:28.759 --> 12:31.387
and a member of the
ruling Zwahan tribe, you,

12:31.507 --> 12:33.477
are the next in line to lead.

12:33.597 --> 12:36.436
We know this is a daunting
task for someone so young,

12:36.556 --> 12:38.601
so we will appoint an interim leader

12:38.613 --> 12:40.703
until you feel you are ready.

12:41.629 --> 12:43.462
Who did you have in mind?

12:43.968 --> 12:45.120
Roman...

12:45.720 --> 12:47.479
I have volunteered myself.

12:48.811 --> 12:49.650
You?

12:49.856 --> 12:51.783
Opposing the Trags can be risky,

12:51.820 --> 12:54.054
but your Uncle is prepared to take them on.

12:54.060 --> 12:56.244
If you're looking for someone
to carry on my father's message,

12:56.262 --> 12:57.652
that person is not Castor.

12:57.664 --> 12:59.015
Your father wanted you to lead,

12:59.028 --> 13:00.698
but not if it meant your
life would be in danger.

13:00.717 --> 13:03.332
Don't pretend that you knew what my
father wanted. You were never even...

13:03.376 --> 13:05.473
Your father would want
what is best for our people.

13:05.523 --> 13:07.512
Let the boy speak.

13:08.826 --> 13:11.060
If you ever want to stop the Trags,

13:11.336 --> 13:13.963
we need a leader who's going
to look towards the future.

13:14.083 --> 13:16.978
Castor will only lead our
people backward into violence.

13:17.191 --> 13:19.700
So we should adapt to
be more like the humans?

13:20.175 --> 13:22.284
Even after they murdered your father?

13:23.810 --> 13:26.820
I will not let you tell
me how to honor my father.

13:28.303 --> 13:30.567
But the question still remains.

13:30.939 --> 13:32.657
If not Castor, then

13:32.682 --> 13:35.460
who will lead our people
and stand up to the Trags?

13:40.458 --> 13:41.546
I will.

13:53.728 --> 13:56.193
Em, that was amazing.

13:56.231 --> 13:58.214
Like, you were, like, "what up, Red Hawks?

13:58.221 --> 14:00.022
What up, school board? Do not mind me.

14:00.059 --> 14:02.913
I just came by to just drop some
knowledge at your front door."

14:02.957 --> 14:05.340
- It was good. I really enjoyed it.
- What's going on?

14:06.560 --> 14:10.164
Right. I may have uploaded
your speech to my vlog.

14:11.453 --> 14:12.686
Oh.

14:12.688 --> 14:14.050
Just so you know,

14:14.170 --> 14:16.171
if those tatties try
something at the carnival,

14:16.641 --> 14:18.442
blood's on your hands.

14:21.545 --> 14:22.796
Don't listen to Eric.

14:22.798 --> 14:24.498
What you did was seriously bad-ass.

14:24.618 --> 14:26.069
Thanks, Zoe.

14:32.399 --> 14:35.496
Roman, our people need a
strong, decisive leader,

14:35.515 --> 14:37.992
who is well-versed in the
politics of the sector.

14:38.013 --> 14:39.812
And that's you? A former Trag?

14:39.932 --> 14:42.071
My father caught you trying to build a bomb

14:42.101 --> 14:43.429
out of fertilizer and gasoline.

14:43.469 --> 14:44.862
I'm not the radical I once was.

14:44.905 --> 14:47.064
But my past... it gave me experience.

14:47.101 --> 14:48.535
And I've built relationships.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.638
How long have you been
plotting to replace my father?

14:50.663 --> 14:53.122
No one can replace your father, Roman.

14:53.341 --> 14:55.160
But you are too young to rule.

14:55.180 --> 14:56.757
Based on what?

14:59.691 --> 15:01.106
My whole life,

15:01.362 --> 15:03.735
my father's been grooming
me for this position.

15:03.746 --> 15:05.078
Well, then, as iksen,

15:05.366 --> 15:07.531
how are you gonna harness the Trags?

15:07.651 --> 15:10.778
How are you going to prevent
them from declaring war?

15:12.997 --> 15:15.198
They respected my father.

15:15.477 --> 15:17.623
And they'll respect me.

15:26.908 --> 15:29.610
When an apology comes with fried pickles,

15:29.730 --> 15:32.256
I'm told it's your duty to accept.

15:32.376 --> 15:33.858
But, uh,

15:34.202 --> 15:35.760
what are you apologizing for?

15:35.880 --> 15:38.194
For leaving you at the party on Friday.

15:38.231 --> 15:39.502
Don't worry about it.

15:39.622 --> 15:41.216
Take a seat.

15:45.583 --> 15:47.897
I'm sorry to hear about
what happened to your dad.

15:48.410 --> 15:50.294
It sounds like he, uh,

15:50.363 --> 15:51.583
didn't mean to hurt anyone.

15:51.703 --> 15:54.048
I just wish everyone saw it that way.

15:54.098 --> 15:55.424
You mean Roman?

15:56.600 --> 15:58.202
When you lose someone close to you,

15:58.233 --> 16:00.010
it can mess with your head for a while.

16:01.213 --> 16:02.632
I can relate.

16:03.070 --> 16:04.089
You can?

16:05.291 --> 16:07.651
I lost my brother ten years ago.

16:07.653 --> 16:09.288
He was in the national guard,

16:09.320 --> 16:11.497
and he was killed in action...

16:11.954 --> 16:13.549
on arrival day.

16:14.432 --> 16:17.166
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.000
I don't tell many people.

16:19.231 --> 16:20.508
Thanks.

16:20.683 --> 16:21.828
For what?

16:23.630 --> 16:26.152
I'm just glad you told me.

16:30.650 --> 16:32.375
Enjoy the pickles.

16:34.510 --> 16:36.262
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:36.331 --> 16:38.547
You are officially my hero.

16:38.667 --> 16:40.283
You saw the video?

16:40.285 --> 16:42.758
Um, everyone saw the video.

16:43.220 --> 16:45.210
Hey, how'd it go with Roman today?

16:45.779 --> 16:47.563
He could barely even look at me.

16:48.163 --> 16:50.108
It's okay, Em.

16:50.146 --> 16:52.029
He's just hurting right now.

16:52.323 --> 16:54.931
But that was one way to get his attention.

16:55.151 --> 16:56.790
Yeah, I guess so.

16:58.567 --> 17:00.075
Excuse.

17:01.847 --> 17:03.490
Hey, can I volunteer?

17:04.128 --> 17:06.781
If the Atrians are coming,
I don't want to miss it.

17:07.531 --> 17:10.104
I don't know you, and I know everyone.

17:10.291 --> 17:12.464
- Freshman?
- Junior.

17:12.925 --> 17:16.173
I am down a few ticket scanners.

17:16.223 --> 17:18.488
Some of my volunteers are
boycotting the carnival

17:18.507 --> 17:19.805
if the Atrians attend.

17:19.925 --> 17:21.160
Sorry.

17:21.178 --> 17:22.449
It's their loss.

17:22.569 --> 17:24.996
Homecoming is no place for politics.

17:37.174 --> 17:38.842
How did it go with the hwatab?

17:39.061 --> 17:41.063
I'll tell you later.

17:42.147 --> 17:43.728
I need to know where Hadar

17:43.753 --> 17:45.637
and the rest of the
Trags are meeting tonight.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.776
Roman, you don't want to
get mixed up in all that.

17:47.820 --> 17:50.304
I don't really have a choice.

17:50.317 --> 17:52.069
My mother said there's
a lot of heat on them

17:52.088 --> 17:53.445
- after last night's bombing.
- Teri.

17:55.178 --> 17:56.223
Please.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.304
It's initiation night for
the Trags' new recruits.

18:01.535 --> 18:02.555
They think

18:02.592 --> 18:03.911
they can control us,

18:05.098 --> 18:06.084
imprison us,

18:06.614 --> 18:08.722
murder our leader.

18:08.842 --> 18:11.574
But the tide is turning.

18:12.515 --> 18:13.893
We will show them

18:13.895 --> 18:15.809
that we are not powerless.

18:16.019 --> 18:20.524
Nox fell so that you all could rise up.

18:33.677 --> 18:36.704
You'd be wise to announce
yourself next time, Roman.

18:38.468 --> 18:41.715
I knew it was only a matter
of time before you came to us.

18:42.954 --> 18:46.170
You're using my father's
death to build an army?

18:46.402 --> 18:49.173
We must show the world what
makes us the superior race.

18:49.192 --> 18:50.286
In case you haven't noticed,

18:50.317 --> 18:52.689
we're outnumbered by
about seven billion people.

18:53.089 --> 18:55.984
A couple of stolen temblor guns
are not going to win this war.

18:56.387 --> 18:59.452
We've been amassing an
arsenal inside the sector.

19:00.647 --> 19:01.817
Where?

19:01.886 --> 19:03.369
Somewhere safe.

19:04.312 --> 19:05.671
As our new iksen,

19:05.884 --> 19:09.648
those weapons are as much
yours as they are ours.

19:09.669 --> 19:11.615
But only if you stand with us.

19:13.048 --> 19:14.371
Do you?

19:18.423 --> 19:19.424
Yes.

19:19.761 --> 19:21.493
I stand with you.

19:21.613 --> 19:25.048
Then tomorrow night, I will
take you to our weapons bunker.

19:25.317 --> 19:27.257
We will arm our people,

19:27.325 --> 19:29.252
and prepare for the uprising.

19:43.211 --> 19:45.407
The Atrian seven have done nothing wrong.

19:45.426 --> 19:47.134
Local news is all over this.

19:47.136 --> 19:49.384
Shut it off. I'm tired of hearing it.

19:49.504 --> 19:51.082
Because she's right...

19:51.426 --> 19:52.465
And you know it.

19:52.509 --> 19:54.767
All I know is I've got a
gaggle of angry parents calling

19:54.792 --> 19:57.492
for the Atrian seven to be sent
back to the sector for good.

19:57.514 --> 19:58.978
Oh, well, that's not an option.

19:59.098 --> 20:01.758
Not as long as my employers
in D.C. have a vested interest

20:01.762 --> 20:03.295
in seeing this program succeed.

20:03.318 --> 20:05.271
If we invite the Atrians to the carnival,

20:05.272 --> 20:07.424
the town might set fire to the school.

20:07.943 --> 20:09.955
Then I'll build you a new one.

20:10.402 --> 20:12.324
I'm overruling the board, Saul.

20:12.326 --> 20:14.294
Make the announcement.

20:18.222 --> 20:19.911
Attention, students.

20:20.031 --> 20:22.132
After much discussion, the
school board has decided

20:22.145 --> 20:23.396
to reverse its decision

20:23.516 --> 20:26.837
and allow the Atrian seven to
attend tonight's homecoming carnival.

20:26.868 --> 20:28.376
Whoa!

20:28.833 --> 20:31.229
- Oh, settle down, man!
- What's that all about?

20:31.248 --> 20:32.605
What's Eric's problem?

20:32.912 --> 20:34.545
Ugh!

20:34.547 --> 20:37.098
His dad used to own this restaurant.

20:37.117 --> 20:39.938
It was a popular neighborhood
joint over in Bunkhead.

20:39.985 --> 20:41.852
- Where they put the sector?
- Yup.

20:42.103 --> 20:45.038
People stopped coming around,
and the place shut down.

20:45.357 --> 20:48.954
Now, Eric's dad does a lot
of drinking his breakfast.

20:53.830 --> 20:56.833
Hey, I know you have no
reason to listen to me, but

20:56.834 --> 20:58.866
I hope you come to the
homecoming carnival tonight.

20:59.630 --> 21:00.549
So,

21:00.571 --> 21:02.788
you think that if we ride
around in circles together

21:02.807 --> 21:05.190
on wooden horses at high speeds...

21:05.541 --> 21:07.568
- That all of our problems will be solved.
- No,

21:07.578 --> 21:10.089
I... I just wanted to find
a way to bring us together.

21:10.458 --> 21:11.278
All of us.

21:13.081 --> 21:15.020
I heard what you said to the board.

21:15.070 --> 21:17.451
You tried to do a good thing.

21:17.684 --> 21:20.387
This is bigger than the two of us now.

21:21.871 --> 21:23.685
Maybe it's safer if we're apart.

21:32.933 --> 21:35.135
You're sure you won't reconsider
coming to the carnival?

21:36.756 --> 21:38.906
I need to meet with Hadar.

21:38.908 --> 21:41.179
Find out where the Trags
are hiding their weapons.

21:41.198 --> 21:43.488
I need to stop them from arming
every Trag in this sector.

21:43.507 --> 21:45.146
Roman, please be careful.

21:45.197 --> 21:46.648
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

21:49.163 --> 21:50.839
I'm a little surprised
you're going to the carnival.

21:50.864 --> 21:52.322
They shut down Weeble's tunnel.

21:52.341 --> 21:54.160
Got to find another way
to bust out of this slum.

21:54.168 --> 21:56.214
Even if you could escape,
where would you go?

21:56.239 --> 21:58.420
I heard about a place where
all the Atrians who escaped

21:58.466 --> 21:59.807
on arrival day have set up shop.

21:59.809 --> 22:02.103
Deep in the swamplands of Louisiana.

22:02.132 --> 22:04.090
No searches, no seizures. Just freedom.

22:04.210 --> 22:05.817
I think you've been smoking too much dovor.

22:05.842 --> 22:07.437
Hey, I'm serious, all right?

22:07.475 --> 22:09.728
These savages want to wipe us all out.

22:09.730 --> 22:11.260
We got to start thinking about
how we're going to make things

22:11.279 --> 22:12.042
better for ourselves.

22:12.067 --> 22:13.444
Remember what my dad said:

22:13.500 --> 22:15.046
If we ever want to be treated as equals,

22:15.064 --> 22:17.323
we need to show the humans
there's nothing to fear.

22:17.342 --> 22:19.493
I'll try to remember that while
they're deep frying our toes

22:19.518 --> 22:21.445
and sprinkling them with powdered sugar.

23:04.421 --> 23:07.155
We must send the message that our reach

23:07.174 --> 23:09.276
extends beyond the sector

23:09.295 --> 23:11.008
by taking action tonight.

23:11.315 --> 23:13.205
Not only against those

23:13.261 --> 23:14.975
who have wronged us,

23:15.232 --> 23:16.883
but also those

23:16.946 --> 23:18.785
they care most about.

23:35.421 --> 23:36.529
Castor.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.268
And we'll talk like this
at the meeting. Thank you.

23:39.650 --> 23:40.643
Roman.

23:41.001 --> 23:43.060
The Trags are planning an attack tonight

23:43.279 --> 23:44.461
at the carnival.

23:44.716 --> 23:46.641
- Can you stop it?
- I can try.

23:46.644 --> 23:48.221
But Hadar is also planning

23:48.228 --> 23:49.861
on arming his soldiers inside the sector.

23:49.901 --> 23:50.943
Where?

23:51.131 --> 23:52.489
I don't know.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.297
I convinced him to take
me there later tonight.

23:54.885 --> 23:57.187
But if I leave to stop
the attack at the carnival,

23:57.307 --> 23:59.896
I won't be here to prevent
him from mobilizing his army.

24:00.016 --> 24:02.499
Castor, if you want to prove
to me that you've changed,

24:02.987 --> 24:05.133
you have got to stop Hadar.

24:07.035 --> 24:08.612
Of course I will.

24:10.364 --> 24:11.302
Go.

24:11.484 --> 24:12.741
I got this.

24:24.140 --> 24:24.803
Hi.

24:24.834 --> 24:25.803
Thank you.

24:25.804 --> 24:26.980
Let me see.

24:27.725 --> 24:29.064
Have fun.

24:29.089 --> 24:31.303
Thank you.

24:33.543 --> 24:36.159
Do you guys realize this
is my first job ever?

24:36.334 --> 24:37.579
How exciting is that?

24:37.610 --> 24:39.838
Okay, you know that there's
a carnival going on, right?

24:39.869 --> 24:41.070
Like, um, games, rides.

24:41.076 --> 24:42.422
Artery-clogging treats.

24:42.991 --> 24:44.380
Everyone's a little on edge

24:44.391 --> 24:45.938
waiting for the Atrians to arrive.

24:46.476 --> 24:48.222
If they even show up.

24:49.273 --> 24:51.301
Do you still think I did the right thing?

24:51.421 --> 24:53.231
Was this about doing the right thing

24:53.233 --> 24:55.023
or was this about getting Roman alone

24:55.048 --> 24:57.651
so you could, you know, tilt his whirl?

24:57.705 --> 24:59.015
It doesn't matter. He's not coming.

24:59.077 --> 25:00.329
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:00.736 --> 25:03.650
- See you in there?
- Yeah. Sure.

25:06.434 --> 25:07.804
Grayson's a friend.

25:09.237 --> 25:11.552
When I come to school, promise
I can make friends like that?

25:11.583 --> 25:12.398
Hey, guys.

25:12.459 --> 25:14.374
Here they come.

25:18.410 --> 25:20.950
I thought you said he wasn't coming?

25:21.827 --> 25:24.110
I guess he changed his mind.

25:35.303 --> 25:38.025
You here to campaign for homecoming king?

25:38.056 --> 25:40.109
You show me your school
spirit, I'll show you mine.

26:05.330 --> 26:06.650
Here,

26:07.107 --> 26:08.790
I got this for you.

26:11.882 --> 26:12.972
Thanks, kid.

26:13.190 --> 26:14.508
You're welcome.

26:26.371 --> 26:27.820
Is that a fish?

26:30.323 --> 26:32.621
I was going for phi,

26:32.653 --> 26:35.437
which is the, um, the Greek
symbol for the golden ratio.

26:35.463 --> 26:37.369
A fish will work just as well.

26:37.432 --> 26:38.963
Here you go.

26:38.965 --> 26:41.293
Have fun, guys. Bye.

26:43.658 --> 26:45.369
I'm sorry about your dad.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.274
I thought he was really inspiring.

26:47.781 --> 26:48.606
Thanks.

26:49.276 --> 26:52.043
And I am keeping your family in my prayers.

26:52.367 --> 26:54.538
Oh, right, you guys do that.

26:54.658 --> 26:56.615
- Pray.
- Well, yes, it is the south.

26:56.627 --> 26:59.155
Everybody does that prayer thing.

27:00.500 --> 27:01.777
So, I'm guessing

27:01.783 --> 27:03.547
that you don't have bumper cars

27:03.579 --> 27:04.943
where you guys are from?

27:17.782 --> 27:20.128
I see you've had a change of heart.

27:20.622 --> 27:22.304
Or should I say hearts?

27:22.348 --> 27:24.173
Emery, you need to leave.

27:24.175 --> 27:26.884
You really know how to
sweep a girl off her feet.

27:26.910 --> 27:28.743
I think you could be in danger.

27:29.237 --> 27:30.739
What are you talking about?

27:30.745 --> 27:32.121
There are a group of Atrians

27:32.128 --> 27:34.349
who want revenge for my father's death.

27:34.384 --> 27:35.817
They've targeted your family.

27:36.251 --> 27:38.078
But they're in the sector.

27:38.116 --> 27:40.021
Trust me, they're resourceful.

27:40.023 --> 27:41.063
There are guards everywhere.

27:41.082 --> 27:42.533
Don't you think I'm safer in a crowd?

27:42.802 --> 27:44.224
Come on.

27:50.029 --> 27:52.900
Are you still seriously
trying to bang that drum?

27:54.803 --> 27:56.669
She likes dark and mysterious.

27:57.206 --> 27:58.989
I can be dark and mysterious.

28:11.671 --> 28:12.841
What is this place?

28:14.168 --> 28:15.687
It's mammoth rock.

28:16.576 --> 28:18.957
It's a tradition for every new student

28:18.959 --> 28:20.692
to leave their handprint

28:20.694 --> 28:22.608
as a way of forever making their mark.

28:23.333 --> 28:24.910
Of course, rocks weather over time,

28:24.935 --> 28:26.211
especially in human climates,

28:26.236 --> 28:27.876
so it doesn't actually last forever.

28:27.901 --> 28:29.840
Shut up. Give me your hand.

28:44.281 --> 28:46.146
We may be from two different worlds,

28:46.177 --> 28:49.337
but in some ways we're still the same.

28:51.083 --> 28:53.160
And now you're laughing at me.

28:53.161 --> 28:54.944
No. I'm not.

28:58.529 --> 28:59.997
You have faith.

29:01.035 --> 29:04.132
The same kind of faith my dad had.

29:06.894 --> 29:09.390
And I can't explain
why, but that feels good.

29:11.186 --> 29:12.531
Roman.

29:14.347 --> 29:16.293
Have you seen Drake? I
can't find him anywhere,

29:16.311 --> 29:18.329
- and I'm worried about him.
- Go.

29:18.648 --> 29:19.948
I'll be fine.

29:19.950 --> 29:21.348
Stay by the guards.

29:52.980 --> 29:54.146
Having fun?

29:56.550 --> 29:58.283
More fun than your friend Eric.

29:58.789 --> 30:00.352
Since when is he on trash duty?

30:01.710 --> 30:03.249
What are you talking about?

30:57.811 --> 30:59.519
Beaumont, what are you doing?

31:08.564 --> 31:10.051
You're an Atrian?

31:10.053 --> 31:11.398
What?

31:19.401 --> 31:20.364
What do you want with Emery?

31:20.484 --> 31:22.648
Killing the daughter of
the man who murdered Nox

31:22.666 --> 31:24.694
will send a message that we're serious

31:24.744 --> 31:26.221
about getting justice.

31:26.264 --> 31:27.678
She's innocent in all this.

31:27.798 --> 31:29.875
You spend a lot of time
with her, don't you?

31:30.363 --> 31:32.522
This will not please the Trags.

31:32.897 --> 31:34.974
We keep with our own kind.

31:34.991 --> 31:36.225
You should know better.

31:36.238 --> 31:38.284
You're gonna lecture me on Atrian purity

31:38.327 --> 31:39.908
when you've had your markings removed?

31:40.028 --> 31:41.130
It's a small price to pay

31:41.173 --> 31:42.813
to be able to help the Trags build an army

31:42.851 --> 31:44.079
outside of the sector.

31:44.652 --> 31:45.816
An army?

31:46.268 --> 31:48.401
How many of you are there?

31:48.737 --> 31:50.003
Enough.

31:50.005 --> 31:51.329
We lie in wait.

31:51.449 --> 31:52.424
For what?

31:52.741 --> 31:53.863
Instruction.

31:54.526 --> 31:57.147
And the Whitehill family
is only the beginning.

32:04.189 --> 32:05.691
Eric.

32:06.353 --> 32:08.220
What's going on?

32:08.413 --> 32:10.822
Nothing, man. I w... I was just taking off.

32:14.725 --> 32:17.347
- Oh, my God.
- What the hell are you doing?

32:17.366 --> 32:18.292
Okay, hold on a minute...

32:18.336 --> 32:19.746
This has gone way too far.

32:19.775 --> 32:21.489
We caught him trying to run away.

32:21.609 --> 32:23.472
No one touches him.

32:30.309 --> 32:33.631
Old alien Rambo here's got
a lot of meat on them bones.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.953
The gators are gonna love him.

32:36.148 --> 32:37.073
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:37.098 --> 32:38.893
Hey. I thought we were just
gonna scare him a little bit

32:38.906 --> 32:40.369
and then, you know, ditch him somewhere.

32:40.419 --> 32:42.309
Well, you don't make the plans.

32:42.429 --> 32:43.786
I do.

32:43.788 --> 32:45.412
What's wrong with you?

32:45.890 --> 32:47.276
Oh, I know you.

32:47.301 --> 32:49.942
You're that little race
traitor bitch, aren't you?

32:50.342 --> 32:52.707
Security guards were right behind us.

32:53.130 --> 32:55.341
I don't think they take
too kindly to vigilantes.

32:57.300 --> 32:58.456
Hey...

32:59.445 --> 33:00.552
Come on.

33:00.672 --> 33:02.070
Don't look at her.

33:02.072 --> 33:03.538
Look at me.

33:10.581 --> 33:12.207
Hey.

33:12.964 --> 33:14.141
Eric.

33:14.697 --> 33:16.174
Boys.

33:20.122 --> 33:21.542
You stay away from Emery.

33:21.767 --> 33:24.220
I should say the same thing to you.

33:25.759 --> 33:27.261
You're not gonna kill me.

33:27.267 --> 33:30.039
I am prepared to do whatever is necessary.

33:30.308 --> 33:32.610
If the Trags sent you here to kill Emery

33:32.617 --> 33:34.481
and I'm the one who ends up dead,

33:34.656 --> 33:36.602
who do you think they'll blame?

33:40.307 --> 33:41.815
Just know

33:41.935 --> 33:44.412
one of us is always watching.

33:54.345 --> 33:56.141
Get me the hell out of here.

33:56.210 --> 33:57.905
I'm trying. Hold still.

34:05.897 --> 34:07.981
You tell anyone about this and you're dead.

34:08.018 --> 34:09.275
You hear me?

34:10.346 --> 34:11.803
You're welcome.

34:20.033 --> 34:21.853
Belonged to my brother.

34:22.911 --> 34:24.675
Comes in handy sometimes.

34:26.597 --> 34:27.771
You okay?

34:27.978 --> 34:30.279
Just a little shaken up.

34:41.149 --> 34:43.598
Oh, hey. Roman. Hi.

34:44.224 --> 34:46.163
I don't know if you remember me

34:46.219 --> 34:47.821
from that whole failed cyper expedition,

34:47.840 --> 34:49.940
but can I just say how
psyched I am that you guys

34:49.942 --> 34:51.525
are finally able to
hang outside the sector.

34:51.550 --> 34:54.009
I... I'm sorry. Have
you seen Drake? Or Teri?

34:54.036 --> 34:56.963
The big guy and the scary
girl. Yeah. They're...

34:56.994 --> 34:58.145
heading back to the bus.

34:58.358 --> 34:59.372
Hey, what happened to your...

34:59.374 --> 35:00.843
I'm sorry. I have to go.

35:02.400 --> 35:03.343
Arm.

35:08.443 --> 35:09.514
Hey.

35:12.072 --> 35:13.085
Are you all right?

35:13.529 --> 35:15.487
You look like you saw a ghost.

35:16.445 --> 35:18.090
Not a ghost.

35:18.610 --> 35:21.362
But... maybe an angel.

36:12.902 --> 36:15.567
I looked everywhere for you
last night when I got back.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.621
Did you stop Hadar?

36:18.658 --> 36:19.910
Hadar is gone.

36:20.030 --> 36:21.010
What do you mean "he's gone"?

36:21.042 --> 36:23.663
The SEU guards raided
his bunker last night.

36:23.783 --> 36:25.108
They shipped him to the crate.

36:25.228 --> 36:26.222
You ratted him out?

36:26.272 --> 36:27.392
No, Roman.

36:27.436 --> 36:29.125
I played the politics.

36:29.582 --> 36:32.453
I convinced some of his
more enterprising underlings

36:32.497 --> 36:34.205
that it would be in their best interests

36:34.236 --> 36:35.381
to get rid of Hadar,

36:35.412 --> 36:37.108
make room for themselves at the top.

36:37.333 --> 36:39.029
And they listened to you?

36:39.149 --> 36:40.868
I told you.

36:41.618 --> 36:43.102
I'm not a Trag anymore,

36:43.587 --> 36:45.467
but I have sway over them.

36:45.673 --> 36:47.144
And as the new iksen,

36:47.550 --> 36:49.176
you will need to keep a watchful eye

36:49.214 --> 36:51.222
over the Trags' activities
inside the sector.

36:51.398 --> 36:53.831
I have reason to believe that
they're recruiting Atrians

36:53.856 --> 36:55.678
living outside the sector,

36:55.798 --> 36:58.423
amongst the humans, to join their army.

36:59.668 --> 37:01.801
I need to weed them out.

37:01.803 --> 37:03.810
If that's the case,

37:03.930 --> 37:06.619
war could be coming much
sooner than we thought.

37:11.647 --> 37:13.987
Right now our people need a leader

37:14.982 --> 37:17.782
who can fully devote
themselves to protecting them.

37:21.007 --> 37:23.215
That's why I'm stepping down.

37:23.540 --> 37:26.025
You will be the new iksen.

37:29.959 --> 37:33.200
I will make you and your father proud.

37:35.767 --> 37:38.281
But know the second
that I doubt your loyalty

37:38.331 --> 37:39.833
you will be replaced.

37:39.876 --> 37:41.159
As I should be.

37:42.004 --> 37:44.708
But I will not let our people down.

37:48.097 --> 37:49.542
One more thing.

37:49.724 --> 37:52.013
I need you to use your
influence over the Trags

37:52.051 --> 37:54.655
to get them to stop targeting
the Whitehill family.

37:56.031 --> 37:57.689
Can you do that?

37:59.698 --> 38:01.431
You have my word.

38:01.694 --> 38:03.333
I'll do what I can, Roman.

38:18.556 --> 38:19.775
Hey.

38:20.114 --> 38:23.065
I didn't get a chance to say
good-bye after the carnival.

38:23.067 --> 38:25.507
We keep with our own kind.

38:25.957 --> 38:26.770
Just know

38:26.771 --> 38:28.685
one of us is always watching.

38:35.592 --> 38:36.899
Roman?

38:37.019 --> 38:38.632
Is everything okay?

38:42.517 --> 38:44.232
It will be.

38:49.648 --> 38:50.987
Hey.

38:52.176 --> 38:53.515
Ready?

38:53.635 --> 38:54.841
Yeah.

39:11.940 --> 39:14.512
Roman knows the closer he
gets to that human girl,

39:14.632 --> 39:17.371
the more vulnerable she becomes
to an attack by the Trags.

39:17.802 --> 39:20.674
Well, unlike the Trags,
I mean no harm to Emery,

39:20.999 --> 39:24.153
but I do have my reasons
to keep those two apart.

39:24.810 --> 39:26.774
You still have spies in the school?

39:26.894 --> 39:28.607
- I do.
- Good.

39:28.845 --> 39:32.229
I need you to tell me every
move those Trags are making.

39:32.611 --> 39:34.544
I know they think that you're their dog,

39:34.839 --> 39:36.509
but you answer to me now.

39:36.629 --> 39:37.929
You understand?

39:38.386 --> 39:40.338
Whatever you say, iksen.

41:01.494 --> 41:02.793
Get in.

41:13.108 --> 41:15.160
You gonna tell me what that was all about?

41:15.280 --> 41:17.901
Going after them at a
carnival was too risky.

41:17.932 --> 41:20.647
There were guards everywhere,
and now he's seen your face.

41:20.767 --> 41:21.873
Relax.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.064
Tattie ain't gonna talk.

41:24.101 --> 41:25.596
He's the one trying to escape.

41:26.584 --> 41:29.724
I'm more concerned about you undermining me

41:29.725 --> 41:31.148
in front of my soldiers.

41:31.148 --> 41:33.233
