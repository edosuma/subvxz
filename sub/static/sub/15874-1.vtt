WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:01.802
I am Nikki Bella.

00:01.869 --> 00:02.870
I'm Brie Bella.

00:02.936 --> 00:04.371
And we're the Bella Twins.

00:04.438 --> 00:06.540
Not only do we get
to travel the world

00:06.607 --> 00:08.242
but we rock the red carpets,

00:08.308 --> 00:09.743
we attend charities,

00:09.810 --> 00:11.311
we mingle with celebrities.

00:11.378 --> 00:12.880
It's like a dream come true.

00:14.581 --> 00:16.383
Nikki is very loud.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.552
‐ She's more passive.
‐ I'm more sweet.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.354
Good luck.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.523
People constantly are like,
"You're what?"

00:24.491 --> 00:25.492
Look out!

00:25.559 --> 00:27.227
From Scottsdale, Arizona,

00:27.294 --> 00:29.663
the Bella Twins.

00:30.797 --> 00:33.066
We are WWE Divas.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.568
Great victory.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.637
When you walk out that ring,

00:36.703 --> 00:38.105
there's this energy.

00:38.171 --> 00:39.540
You just keep this feeling
in your body,

00:39.606 --> 00:41.074
I don't even have
the words for it.

00:41.508 --> 00:43.243
It's a drug
and I'm addicted to it.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.178
Oh, wild.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.515
WWE is a huge organization.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.317
We're in 144 countries.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.353
We have tens of thousands
of people that watches live.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.989
We've 14 million viewers
that watches on TV.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.625
We're sports entertainers.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.561
We are Broadway with body slams.

01:00.627 --> 01:02.229
Yeah! Shoulders down!

01:02.563 --> 01:04.096
The Bellas been so nasty

01:04.164 --> 01:06.233
since returning to WWE.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.069
Bree and I left the WWE
for 11 months.

01:09.136 --> 01:11.238
The other girls
are definitely mad we're back.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.873
These damned Bella Twins.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.308
Hey, baby girl!

01:15.776 --> 01:16.810
I'm Ariane.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.146
Trinity and I
make "The Funkadactyls."

01:19.479 --> 01:21.815
Trinity is my sister
from another mister.

01:22.182 --> 01:25.085
You're like the mouthpiece
and I'm like the action.

01:25.152 --> 01:27.955
When I think
of Trinity, I think it's plow!

01:28.021 --> 01:30.357
That girl has a freaking donk.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.826
She tossed her
that Rear View!

01:32.893 --> 01:35.362
The Rear View is
my signature move

01:35.429 --> 01:37.164
where I jump up in the air
doing toe touch

01:37.230 --> 01:39.066
and they run smack them
to my butt.

01:39.132 --> 01:40.701
Oh!
There's the rear view!

01:40.767 --> 01:42.769
Since the Bella Twins
have been on hiatus,

01:42.836 --> 01:45.505
The Funkadactyls have definitely
become the fan favorites.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.240
The Funkadactyls.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.611
The competition is
out of control

01:50.677 --> 01:52.079
when it comes to TV time.

01:52.145 --> 01:55.182
My goal is to be
the best diva ever in the ring.

01:55.248 --> 01:56.984
I'm gonna beat those Bellas.

01:57.050 --> 01:59.286
In the Divas division,
there has been a hierarchy.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.687
You have the people
who are at the top

02:00.754 --> 02:02.155
who are like,
the face of the company.

02:02.222 --> 02:03.690
Then you have like the mid‐card
who are like,

02:03.757 --> 02:04.758
not quite there yet.

02:04.858 --> 02:05.959
And you have veterans

02:06.026 --> 02:07.561
and they've been there
for years.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.496
My name is Nattie.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.165
I come from WWE royalty.

02:12.232 --> 02:13.433
They're called the Hart Family.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.268
My uncle's Bret Hart.

02:15.335 --> 02:16.737
My dad's Jim "Anvil" Niedhart.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.072
My family has been synonymous
with greatness.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.175
Being a diva is in my blood.

02:22.242 --> 02:24.044
You know, I trained
for almost 13 years.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.147
We're not just cheerleaders.

02:27.214 --> 02:28.215
We have to be glamorous,

02:28.281 --> 02:30.684
we have to be who would go
on the ring and kick some ass.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.419
In the end, it's entertainment.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.287
And we are pretty good
at what we do.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.555
I mean, if I wasn't
in a Bella Twin,

02:35.622 --> 02:36.823
I'd wanna be a Bella Twin,

02:36.890 --> 02:38.025
but.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.571 --> 02:52.939
After you, madam.

02:53.373 --> 02:56.243
When Brie and I left,
a little over a year ago,

02:56.309 --> 02:59.413
I was just mentally
and physically exhausted.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.350
Those 11 months being away,
I missed it.

03:03.417 --> 03:06.053
And now, coming back
and being refreshed,

03:06.119 --> 03:07.287
I can't get enough.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.588
There you go, that's‐‐

03:09.589 --> 03:12.793
Very excited to be back
for Wrestle Mania.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.428
Someone's hungry,
I'm gonna go eat some lunch.

03:14.494 --> 03:15.562
Oh, I could tell.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.963
So that's what that was.

03:17.464 --> 03:19.399
Grumpy 'cause you're hungry.
Go on.

03:19.466 --> 03:20.967
And you are PMS‐ing.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.074
Okay, come on,
let's get ready.
We gonna get worked out.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.842
Come on. Come on,
gotta get amped!

03:28.909 --> 03:31.845
Come on, come on, come on! Pow!

03:31.912 --> 03:34.281
I'm not working out with you
if you don't stop.

03:34.347 --> 03:35.949
Wrestle Mania is coming up.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.285
And Trinity and I get to wrestle
for the first time.

03:38.351 --> 03:40.487
It is like a dream come true.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.189
Five, six, seven, eight.

03:42.255 --> 03:44.825
Left, right, out, boom‐boom.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.827
Have you got to do like this?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.464
That... That... Is that
what you all do?

03:50.530 --> 03:52.065
‐ Yes!
‐ Ta da da da.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.533
I'm currently engaged to Jon,

03:53.600 --> 03:55.469
who also goes by Jimmy Uso.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.541
Jon helps me and Ariane.

04:01.608 --> 04:04.377
So having him,
works out perfectly for us.

04:04.444 --> 04:06.213
‐ I'll drop you.
‐ Hey, um...

04:06.279 --> 04:07.681
you got no Mania
around the corner.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.349
I mean, I'm just be saying.

04:12.285 --> 04:13.286
That's it.

04:13.353 --> 04:14.588
I definitely think
that Trinity and I

04:14.654 --> 04:15.655
complement each other.

04:15.722 --> 04:17.891
I'm like the feisty,
the sassy one,

04:17.958 --> 04:19.526
the one who brings
the personality in the ring.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.395
And she's the one who brings
experience to the ring.

04:22.462 --> 04:24.030
Okay, okay, okay!

04:24.097 --> 04:25.432
All right.

04:32.873 --> 04:35.408
Ouch. Take her again,
she had scissors you.

04:35.475 --> 04:38.645
What accentuates Nattie is
when someone goes after her.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.947
'Cause that's when Nattie
turns everything up.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.621
People will realize what kind
of shape they're...

04:47.687 --> 04:48.789
they're actually really in.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.360
Nice.

04:53.426 --> 04:54.628
Nice.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.798
But on that night,

04:57.864 --> 04:59.232
this is freaking wrestle mania.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.370
Every time you get touched,
they wind up like that.

05:03.436 --> 05:05.038
Wrestle Mania is
the biggest event

05:05.105 --> 05:06.339
of the year for the WWE.

05:06.406 --> 05:09.976
And if there are eight
or ten guys matches on the show,

05:10.043 --> 05:11.878
you only have one girl's match.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.147
So that leaves ten divas
in the locker room

05:14.214 --> 05:16.016
crawling and fighting
for that one spot.

05:16.082 --> 05:18.885
The irony about the family
that I come from is that

05:18.952 --> 05:20.887
a lot of people have
the misconception

05:20.954 --> 05:23.089
that "Oh, doors were open
for Nattie"

05:23.156 --> 05:25.592
and that, you know,
"The Harts they must have
that connection."

05:25.659 --> 05:27.194
But for me it was never easy.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.329
In fact,
it was the total opposite.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.598
I've had the doors slammed
in my face so many times

05:31.665 --> 05:34.467
and I have worked in Japan,
and England, and Canada,

05:34.534 --> 05:37.003
and all over the US
before I ever got to WWE.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.439
Nattie, keep in tune
on your facials on this stuff.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.541
If the fans don't know
what's going on,

05:41.608 --> 05:42.609
‐ they can't see your face.
‐ I know.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.677
‐ Those are big dimples.

05:43.743 --> 05:45.712
I can always kick her ass
and give her a big smile.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.481
Excellent!

05:56.223 --> 05:57.958
So, when's the last time
you had fishing?

05:58.024 --> 06:00.093
I think it was like
fourth or fifth grade.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.495
Fling it and when you fling it,
you let your finger go.

06:02.562 --> 06:03.563
Okay.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.233
My relationship status is
"Taken."

06:06.299 --> 06:07.334
Sorry, boys.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.937
I am madly in‐love
with the most amazing man

06:11.004 --> 06:13.039
that has ever set foot
on this earth

06:13.106 --> 06:14.741
and I couldn't be happier.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.176
That's a nice fishing
outfit.

06:16.243 --> 06:17.611
I like your fishing outfit too.

06:17.677 --> 06:20.647
This whole thing, I just...
I just gonna do this together.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.781
Is it all right?

06:21.848 --> 06:23.483
By the way, he's John Cena.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.086
The WWE Champion,

06:26.152 --> 06:28.955
John Cena!

06:29.022 --> 06:30.824
WWE's biggest star.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.159
Your signature move is
"Can't See Me."

06:33.226 --> 06:34.995
‐ You do the "Can't See Me"‐‐
‐ Yeah, just like that.

06:44.304 --> 06:45.472
It isn't too bad.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.607
I felt like we're The Notebook.

06:48.675 --> 06:49.976
What did you just say?

06:50.310 --> 06:52.279
You knew the movie
when they ran out of each other?

06:52.345 --> 06:53.680
It's like the hottest part.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.949
‐ So we gonna recreate
the Notebook scene?
‐ Yes.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.651
You're off in a distance
then you see me?

06:58.051 --> 06:59.819
No, it's just they finally,
you know,

06:59.886 --> 07:01.221
they're just supposed
to be together.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.789
It's like raining and‐‐
I don't know,

07:02.856 --> 07:04.190
like, she didn't want
to get married

07:04.257 --> 07:05.759
or she was about
to get married or,

07:05.825 --> 07:07.060
but she wanted to be with him,

07:07.127 --> 07:10.230
and they needed
to find each other
to talk or something.

07:10.563 --> 07:11.598
So what do you want me to do,

07:11.665 --> 07:13.767
just kinda see you
and be like "Whoa!"

07:13.833 --> 07:15.335
Maybe like, "Whoa."

07:15.402 --> 07:16.670
Was that cool?

07:16.736 --> 07:18.171
Like, "Oh!"

07:18.238 --> 07:19.773
What's that being by the tree?

07:21.308 --> 07:22.943
Fudge.

07:23.009 --> 07:24.010
Oh!

07:24.077 --> 07:25.712
I needed some fun.

07:25.779 --> 07:29.950
I've never met anyone
who truly cares about how I feel

07:30.016 --> 07:33.653
and he's just... I don't know,
he's just so sweet.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.155
And I'm on cloud nine.

07:35.722 --> 07:36.957
Watch your foot there.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.465
Let's go.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.001
‐ Oh, Josie.
‐ Oh!

07:48.068 --> 07:50.103
No, you're supposed to wait
for the grass.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.571
Should we put water on it?

07:52.205 --> 07:53.807
No?

07:53.873 --> 07:55.208
I live with my boyfriend.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.410
His TV name is Dan O'Brien

07:57.477 --> 07:59.813
but his real name is
Bryan Danielson.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.781
For the World
Heavyweight Champion,

08:01.848 --> 08:03.249
Dan O'Brien.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.785
‐ No!
‐ Yeah!

08:05.852 --> 08:06.886
We've been together now

08:06.953 --> 08:08.355
a little over two
and a half years.

08:08.688 --> 08:11.257
If I can't take Josie
on the road with me this week,

08:11.958 --> 08:14.561
I kinda need to ask my mom
if maybe she can have
minutes with her.

08:14.627 --> 08:15.628
Yeah.

08:15.695 --> 08:18.064
Whenever Nicole and I are not
on the road with WWE,

08:18.131 --> 08:20.633
we are back in sunny San Diego,

08:20.700 --> 08:22.669
where Bryan and I live
in Pacific Beach,

08:22.736 --> 08:25.839
and we're one mile away
from Nikki which is great.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.741
I have a very hippie mentality.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.342
I only shop
at the farmer's market,

08:29.409 --> 08:30.844
I like to cook my food.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.246
It's like the complete opposite
from Nikki.

08:33.313 --> 08:34.714
‐ You have the keys?
‐ No.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.251
What?

08:39.519 --> 08:40.720
Car is fancy.

08:40.787 --> 08:41.855
Yeah, it is.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.657
He got you a Range Rover?

08:45.091 --> 08:46.926
I am in shock.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.963
‐ Dang! This is nice!
‐ Where's the sunroof.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.831
About that sunroof,

08:51.898 --> 08:53.867
this thing
has a huge engine,

08:53.933 --> 08:56.102
and it's red inside.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.203
This is beautiful.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.505
Isn't this beautiful?

08:58.571 --> 09:00.240
Break that back seat in soon.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.244
Nikki has wanted that car

09:04.310 --> 09:05.779
since we couldn't even drive.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.781
I think it's adorable

09:07.847 --> 09:10.850
that John got her something
he knew she really wanted.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.819
Very nice gift.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.654
But she deserves it,
so I'm really happy for her.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.057
‐ Cheers being back in WWE.
‐ Yeah, cheers.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.858
And kick in some serious butts.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.227
‐ And to Nicole's new car.
‐ Yeah.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.163
That car,
that's a pretty big deal.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.232
That's like
a really serious gift.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.967
Didn't you think
that means, like,

09:28.001 --> 09:29.803
he wants to take
to the next level with you?

09:29.869 --> 09:31.104
I don't know.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.505
It's complicated.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.342
John being recently divorced

09:36.409 --> 09:38.978
and married to someone
that he truly cared for in life

09:39.045 --> 09:41.314
kinda puts him
in a delicate position.

09:41.381 --> 09:44.184
I understand that,
that can scar someone

09:44.250 --> 09:47.887
and make them afraid to ever
walk down the aisle again.

09:47.954 --> 09:49.522
I think sometimes
it takes a while

09:49.589 --> 09:50.857
for your heart to heal.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.493
It is slightly odd,
for a man's perspective,

09:53.560 --> 09:55.061
that he gave you a Range Rover

09:55.128 --> 09:56.596
before he gave you a ring.

09:56.663 --> 09:57.697
Maybe, what it is
it's you know,

09:57.764 --> 10:00.600
holding off on asking
for the ring for a while.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.413
Steph.
‐ Hi, Nattie.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.581
You look beautiful.

10:14.647 --> 10:16.382
‐ Oh, thank you.
‐ I'm sorry I missed the...

10:16.449 --> 10:18.618
the whole time I was doing
inciting an access.

10:18.685 --> 10:20.320
But I heard
your speech was great.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.689
‐ Mr. Stevens.
‐ I know.

10:22.755 --> 10:25.091
Today is the first day
of Wrestle Mania week.

10:25.158 --> 10:28.061
Wrestle Mania is
like the Super Bowl of the WWE.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.597
There's thousands of people
that work behind the scenes,

10:30.663 --> 10:32.398
setting up that ring
in that stage is

10:32.465 --> 10:34.367
a huge production
that takes days.

10:34.434 --> 10:37.170
And leading up to it
we have charity, we have press,

10:37.237 --> 10:38.805
we have all
these different campaigns,

10:38.872 --> 10:41.441
every thing from anti‐bullying
to our reading challenge.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.676
You know, this is
the most exciting time
of the year.

10:43.743 --> 10:46.012
It's the one show of the year
that everybody strives

10:46.079 --> 10:48.448
and fights tooth and nail
and claws their way to be on.

10:48.515 --> 10:49.549
It's pretty crazy.

10:52.585 --> 10:54.487
- ‐ Jane?
- Hi Nattie.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.755
- ‐ Hey.
- How are you?

10:55.822 --> 10:57.991
Good, it's nice
to hear your voice.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.626
Jane is my boss.

10:59.692 --> 11:01.094
She's the head
of Talent Relations.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.795
Do you have some time
right now to come down?

11:02.862 --> 11:03.963
Mark and I just wanna chat
with you.

11:04.063 --> 11:05.265
about a couple of things.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.236
‐ Hi, Nattie.
‐ Hi, Mark.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.738
‐ How are you?
‐ I missed you.

11:11.804 --> 11:13.173
Good to see you, sweetie.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.141
How's it going?

11:15.208 --> 11:16.209
Can we just sit
over here,
‐ Yeah.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.610
so we're not gonna
lounge in‐‐
‐ Yeah, no problem.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.678
Okay, cool.

11:18.745 --> 11:20.380
Couple of things we just
want to talk to you about.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.950
I don't know if you've seen
the card yet for Wrestle Mania.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.819
But we just wanna let you know

11:26.886 --> 11:29.422
that you'd not
gonna be in a match.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.592
We just wanna pull you aside
and let you know.

11:32.659 --> 11:33.693
And I know you have
a family coming in

11:33.760 --> 11:34.761
‐ and everything.
‐ Yeah.

11:36.596 --> 11:37.697
It's devastating.

11:37.764 --> 11:38.865
I'm devastated!

11:38.932 --> 11:40.900
I've been working
for this moment for so long

11:40.967 --> 11:42.235
and it's like now
I have to be the one

11:42.302 --> 11:43.336
to call my family and say,

11:43.403 --> 11:45.271
"Hey guys,
no Wrestle Mania this year.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.339
I'm not involved."

11:46.406 --> 11:47.707
Is there's a Diva's Match or‐‐

11:47.774 --> 11:49.776
Well, it's... It's a bit mixed
tag match.

11:49.842 --> 11:53.780
It's gonna be Cody and Damien
are gonna be with the Bellas.

11:53.846 --> 11:55.748
This is gonna be eight people,
and the Funkadactyls

11:55.815 --> 11:58.451
are gonna be
with Brodus and Tensai.

11:59.085 --> 12:00.553
I would be lying to say

12:00.620 --> 12:03.590
that I wasn't like,
a little disappointed by it.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.725
It's so frustrating.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.193
The Bellas leave for a year.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.629
They waltz right back in
like they never missed the beat.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.197
Like, how unfair is that?

12:11.264 --> 12:12.899
I actually taught them
how to wrestle.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.200
So, here I am.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.735
You know, on the sidelines

12:15.802 --> 12:17.937
and then you have the Bellas
capitalizing on the fact

12:18.004 --> 12:19.939
that they're twins,
the fact that they're beautiful,

12:20.039 --> 12:22.208
and they're throwing
their weight around.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.744
On the flipside of that,
we have two new girls are coming

12:24.811 --> 12:26.312
from the LA camp.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.847
They're developmental
so they're not...

12:27.914 --> 12:29.082
you know, they've been
on the ring for a month.

12:29.148 --> 12:32.685
‐ Okay.
‐ So, you know, we thought
that the best person here

12:32.752 --> 12:35.054
to chaperone them
for the week would be you.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.359
Seriously, Jane?

12:39.425 --> 12:41.060
"Nattie, we love you
so much here."

12:41.127 --> 12:42.595
"You're such a leader,
you're such a veteran,

12:42.662 --> 12:44.497
you're such a blah‐blah‐blah."

12:44.564 --> 12:46.232
"We want you in charge
of the new girls,

12:46.299 --> 12:48.368
teach them everything you know
and teach them all your secrets

12:48.434 --> 12:49.535
and just make them amazing

12:49.602 --> 12:51.004
so that they can take
your spot."

12:54.941 --> 12:59.012
Wrestle Mania
is the biggest event
in our careers.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.213
Right now is really not the time

13:00.280 --> 13:01.848
so I suggest you
just keep pushing.

13:01.914 --> 13:03.383
‐ Shh!
‐ No, you shush.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.785
My name is Eva Marie.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.353
JoJo and I are the newbies.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.222
I know that I can be
the baddest diva,

13:09.289 --> 13:10.523
I really believe that.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.125
‐ Newbies!
‐ Oh!

13:12.191 --> 13:13.526
Damn, this girl is hot.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.396
And this girl would
probably be competition.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.897
Make sure not to show us out

13:17.964 --> 13:19.232
'cause then the claws come out.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.005
Oh, my god.

13:27.540 --> 13:30.009
Hi, my name is Eva Marie,
I'm 28 years old,

13:30.076 --> 13:31.678
and I'm from the Bay Area.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.680
JoJo and I are the newbies.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.281
I'll take you over.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.524
I know that
I can be the best diva,

13:44.590 --> 13:45.825
I really believe that.

13:45.892 --> 13:48.828
I can't even say
that I have the slightest clue

13:48.895 --> 13:50.563
as to what's gonna happen. I'm‐‐

13:50.630 --> 13:52.498
All I know is
that I hope I packed right.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.435
My name is JoJo Offerman.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.636
I'm brand new.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.772
I've only started training
about a month or so ago.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.341
I'm learning different moves

14:01.407 --> 14:03.376
to set me apart
from everyone else.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.278
I am only 19.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.180
Being away from home
for the first time

14:07.246 --> 14:09.015
is kind of scary.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.751
‐ We really don't know
when we're coming back.
‐ Right.

14:11.818 --> 14:13.186
We're on a one way ticket, girl.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.758
Even though you won't have
a match, you'd be busy

14:18.825 --> 14:22.261
with the two new divas.
That would be like "What?"

14:22.328 --> 14:23.596
I am‐‐ no.

14:23.663 --> 14:24.764
‐ I'm‐‐
‐ BRIE: Mark.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.300
Hello, there she is.
Hello, how are you there?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.035
‐ Oh, my‐‐
‐ How's it going?

14:29.102 --> 14:30.970
‐ I'm doing good, thank you.
‐ Doing all right?
And how was your trip?

14:31.037 --> 14:32.171
‐ Hey, how are you?
‐ Very good.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.239
‐ Welcome.
‐ Good.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.775
‐ Nattie, how are you?
‐ Brie.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.745
I just heard that you guys
were gonna be part

14:38.811 --> 14:40.246
of the Wrestle Mania match.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.614
Yeah, isn't it exciting?

14:41.681 --> 14:43.416
‐ I'm happy for you Brie.
‐ Thank you , Nattie.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.486
I'm so happy, but there's
like some new girls that are,
I guess, coming up

14:46.552 --> 14:48.221
‐ Really?
‐ That is like, "No!"

14:48.287 --> 14:50.089
I don't know, I'm fine with it,
like, I'm excited

14:50.156 --> 14:52.492
that we're obviously excited
to have new girls come up but,

14:52.558 --> 14:53.793
‐ like‐‐
‐ I guess.

14:53.860 --> 14:57.163
Newbies aren't divas yet,
but they're trying to be.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.665
I don't want Jane to think
that I don't like the new girls.

15:03.936 --> 15:05.805
‐ Hi, Jane.
‐ You must be Eva Marie.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.173
‐ Yes.
‐ You must be JoJo.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.241
‐Yes
‐ This is Mark.

15:08.307 --> 15:09.942
Hi, nice to meet you.

15:10.009 --> 15:12.211
‐ Nice to meet you.
‐ Hi, nice to meet you.

15:12.278 --> 15:14.380
‐ Are you guys ready for this?
‐ Like were they?

15:14.447 --> 15:16.149
‐ Are you ready?
‐ I'm so excited.

15:16.215 --> 15:17.450
Walking in the room
meeting Jane

15:17.517 --> 15:18.684
already I'm freaking out.

15:18.751 --> 15:19.886
I feel like I'm living
in a dream.

15:19.952 --> 15:21.120
This is crazy.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.791
I know you cut your hair
just yesterday.

15:24.857 --> 15:28.494
But, we'd like for you
to turn your hair blonde.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.763
You okay with that?

15:31.998 --> 15:33.199
Oh, my goodness.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.967
I feel you're
the greatest blonde.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.469
I meant, oh, my god.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.172
I understand, like,
I'm Mexican‐Italian, like,

15:39.238 --> 15:41.140
I could be mistaken
as a Bella Twin.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.176
But inside
I'm like no way.

15:43.242 --> 15:45.211
‐ Thank you!
‐ Girls,

15:45.278 --> 15:46.446
Oh!

15:46.546 --> 15:47.847
‐ A couple of our new girls.
‐ Hi.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.549
- How are you?
- This is Eva Marie.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.017
‐ I'm Brie, nice to meet you.
‐ Nice to meet you.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.553
We'd like for Nattie to be

15:53.619 --> 15:55.154
your sort of your chaperone
this week

15:55.221 --> 15:57.790
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ And so she's gonna show
you around.

15:57.857 --> 16:00.693
I'm really excited like
if you guys need anything
like we're here for you.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.396
And if you're having
a life crisis or hair problem

16:03.463 --> 16:05.531
‐ or you need to know
where something is‐‐
‐ Speaking of hair problems‐‐

16:05.598 --> 16:06.966
Funny you said that.

16:07.033 --> 16:11.504
I actually just told Eva Marie
that we like for her
to go blonde.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.873
‐ So‐‐
‐ Oh!

16:15.775 --> 16:17.477
I think you look nice
with your hair like that.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.445
I mean, there's only room
for one blonde.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.214
You know, I'm just kidding.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.849
There's always a rhyme
and a reason

16:22.915 --> 16:25.117
for the decisions
that WWE makes.

16:25.184 --> 16:28.087
They want each individual girl
to stand out.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.856
They want everybody to be
different.

16:29.922 --> 16:33.125
So Eva can't have brown hair

16:33.192 --> 16:35.995
because the Bellas have
dark brown hair.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.563
But, hello!

16:37.630 --> 16:38.998
Natalia's blonde.

16:39.065 --> 16:41.501
I'm here, I'm right here.
You have a blonde girl already.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.836
That's great, I mean,
like I said, I‐‐

16:43.903 --> 16:45.805
What do you think about that?

16:45.872 --> 16:47.673
‐ It freaked you?
‐ Yeah, for sure.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.809
‐ Welcome to WWE.
‐ Yes.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.644
- ‐ Yeah.
- ‐ Yes.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.324
‐ Babe!
‐ Hey, baby.

17:05.391 --> 17:07.126
You made it!

17:07.193 --> 17:10.096
My boyfriend Vincent
just touched down in Jersey

17:10.162 --> 17:12.397
and I'm so excited
to see him right now

17:12.464 --> 17:14.867
because he's gonna be here
for Wrestle Mania.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.769
I'm little nervous for him
to come see me

17:16.868 --> 17:19.070
just because he's never see me
do my craft.

17:19.137 --> 17:20.940
What's going on?
How was your flight?

17:21.007 --> 17:22.575
‐ Nothing, tiring actually.
‐ Tiring?

17:22.642 --> 17:24.377
‐ Got to sit away in the back,
‐ Oh.

17:24.443 --> 17:27.079
and I couldn't recline
my chair the whole time.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.515
We have been together
for seven months.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.818
And growing up in a family
that had a lot of turmoil

17:32.885 --> 17:34.387
have always pushed guys away.

17:34.453 --> 17:36.956
Vincent is so different
from any other guy

17:37.023 --> 17:40.126
just because he's so sweet,
he knows how to balance me.

17:40.192 --> 17:41.827
Come on, use those man powers!

17:41.894 --> 17:43.963
Am I your assistant
or your boyfriend?
Both.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.500
My personality is
a little something crazy
at times

17:47.567 --> 17:49.068
that he just knows
how to mellow me

17:49.135 --> 17:51.037
and he's so supportive
with what I do.

17:51.103 --> 17:52.171
I know that you just got in

17:52.238 --> 17:54.140
but I'm about to go
do dress rehearsals for Mania.

17:54.206 --> 17:55.975
So come meet me
after you take your nap.

17:56.042 --> 17:59.278
Okay, yeah, 'cause this is
my first time in the city,
I wanna check it out.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.380
‐ Give me a kiss.
‐ All right, baby.

18:01.447 --> 18:02.848
‐ Have fun.
‐ And I will see you later.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.283
‐ All right, you take care,
okay?
‐ Okay.

18:04.350 --> 18:05.384
‐ I see you later, all right?
‐ All right.

18:05.451 --> 18:06.686
‐ If you need anything
just call me okay, baby?
‐ Okay.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.020
‐ I'll give you a call.
Bye, baby.
‐ All right, okay.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.522
‐ Bye.
‐ Bye, sweetie.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.730
I would love to be

18:17.830 --> 18:20.066
with the rest of the divas
practicing moves

18:20.132 --> 18:21.734
and getting ready
for that big moment.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.937
But I'm babysitting these girls
and Ariane's boyfriend.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.340
Oh, here they come!

18:28.541 --> 18:30.242
Tons of Funk consists of me,

18:30.309 --> 18:32.044
Trinity, Brodus, and Tinsai.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.312
Tons of Funk!

18:33.980 --> 18:37.350
We just finished our final
dress rehearsal
for Wrestle Mania

18:37.416 --> 18:38.951
and we're all excited
of each other

18:39.018 --> 18:40.953
because we can't
get stuff together

18:41.020 --> 18:42.488
and we're all just
pointing fingers

18:42.555 --> 18:44.957
and I don't know if it's
because of the pressure
of Wrestle Mania.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.193
But right now things are
really freaking stressful.

18:47.259 --> 18:48.961
- ‐ Hi, girls!
- You okay?

18:50.062 --> 18:51.130
Why? What happened?

18:55.868 --> 18:58.104
‐ What?
‐ I'll put him in check,
call him out.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.205
‐ Why?
‐ Why don't you call him out?

18:59.271 --> 19:01.874
Babe, come here,
come here, come here!

19:01.941 --> 19:04.176
Don't worry about it. Listen.

19:04.243 --> 19:05.244
Babe, listen‐‐

19:05.311 --> 19:07.013
I can't even be excited
for the match because‐‐

19:07.079 --> 19:08.614
I know, don't let him
get to you.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.650
- I... I'll talk to his ass.
- this job.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.955
This is Vincent's
first time backstage

19:16.022 --> 19:17.990
and he's
the sweetest person ever.

19:18.057 --> 19:20.226
But he gets so upset
just 'cause like,

19:20.292 --> 19:22.895
"You know what, I don't want
anyone yelling at my girl
like that."

19:22.962 --> 19:24.563
He doesn't talk to you
like that.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.099
respect, where is this ass?
 Call in this ass right now.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.235
I'm gonna lock in right now
his ass up, right now.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.871
Ariane and I are kinda
in a marriage together

19:31.937 --> 19:33.706
as far as our careers.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.242
If she messes up, it affects me.

19:36.308 --> 19:37.910
So, Vin is going off
in the back,

19:37.977 --> 19:39.912
he'll get fired over something
like this.

19:40.312 --> 19:41.814
No one talks to my woman
like that.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.116
I don't care who you are,
you could be president
of United States,

19:44.183 --> 19:45.584
you could be anybody,
I don't give a.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.920
I'll go to jail but I'll put
his ass down in the ground.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.161
I love you.
Don't cry, all right?

19:58.597 --> 20:00.232
No, I'm not gonna stop‐‐

20:00.299 --> 20:01.600
something I know.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.707
Vincent wants to fight Brodus

20:07.773 --> 20:09.041
and I grabbed him by the arm
and like,

20:09.108 --> 20:10.342
"You have got to calm down."

20:10.409 --> 20:12.712
You love her
so you want to defend her

20:12.778 --> 20:15.514
but by helping her,
you got to simmer down.

20:15.581 --> 20:16.582
It's a good thing I did.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.884
I was able to keep Vincent
from getting his ass kicked.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.621
- No, you don't.
- And you just‐‐

20:29.462 --> 20:30.963
What happened right there?

20:31.030 --> 20:34.467
Brodus really tore
Ariane a new one.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.670
And Vinny wanted
to fight Brodus,

20:37.737 --> 20:39.171
he started going off and‐‐

20:39.238 --> 20:41.240
What I couldn't understand
why he did it?

20:41.307 --> 20:43.175
‐ I understand 100 percent.
‐ Hell, I would've done it.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.510
Hell, I would've done it.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.845
It might've been handled wrong

20:45.911 --> 20:48.047
but I think he has
a legit reason to do it.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.716
You just see Ariane's boyfriend
in the back

20:50.783 --> 20:52.718
running his mouth and going off.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.220
It's not my place to tell her

20:54.286 --> 20:57.189
Vinny shouldn't be in the back
but there should be

20:57.256 --> 20:59.759
and there has to be
some kinda boundaries, right?

20:59.825 --> 21:01.193
Yeah.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.296
I really gotta have a talk

21:04.363 --> 21:05.598
with Ariane with this one.

21:05.664 --> 21:06.966
To me, it's very unprofessional.

21:07.032 --> 21:09.702
I understand your emotions
start getting away.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.704
But we can't be having this
at work.

21:11.771 --> 21:12.938
This is horrible!

21:13.005 --> 21:15.341
It should be fun and
I'm starting not to have fun

21:15.407 --> 21:16.842
because of stuff like this.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.283
So, those two new girls
who just signed on.

21:24.350 --> 21:26.118
And they're walking around
like they own the place.

21:26.185 --> 21:28.287
We're veterans, they're newbies.

21:28.354 --> 21:29.455
There's a packing order here.

21:29.522 --> 21:32.591
I don't wanna photobomb,
but I need a champagne.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.927
Are you kidding me?
Bitch, please.

21:38.664 --> 21:40.232
I know something's
not right here.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.534
They we're supposed
to be up right now.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.601
What?

21:42.668 --> 21:44.637
You worked that hard
and you have this happened.

21:44.703 --> 21:45.871
It... It sucks.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.107
There's nothing worst
that could've happened.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.451
Hell, I wanna go meet
these newbies real quick.

21:59.518 --> 22:01.754
‐ Yeah.
‐ Everyone keeps saying
one of them looks like me.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.189
No, she doesn't.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.523
Well, we're gonna go see.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.358
Inside, I'm freaking out

22:06.425 --> 22:10.930
like, why the heck that WWE
hired a girl that looks like me?

22:11.297 --> 22:12.698
Newbies!

22:14.466 --> 22:16.502
‐ Eva?
‐ Hey, you're not gonna cling.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.937
‐ You're not gonna‐‐
‐ Don't...

22:18.037 --> 22:19.705
Push me.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.908
Bellas are here. Hello.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.177
Wow!

22:25.244 --> 22:27.880
My first impression
of Eva Marie is damn!

22:27.947 --> 22:29.315
This girl is hot,

22:29.381 --> 22:32.318
and this girl would
probably be competition.

22:32.384 --> 22:34.119
‐ Nice to meet you.
‐ Nice to meet you.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.521
‐ Hi!
‐ Hi there.

22:35.588 --> 22:38.457
‐ This is Jojo.
‐ Your Jojo, nice to meet you.

22:38.524 --> 22:41.627
Jojo has this
just beautiful big smile

22:41.694 --> 22:44.964
and she's just is,
like a little girl to me.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.565
So, what are you guys' plans?

22:46.632 --> 22:48.400
I'm going to change my hair.

22:48.467 --> 22:49.535
‐ Oh, wow!
‐ Mm‐hm.

22:49.602 --> 22:50.903
‐ Hopefully it doesn't look bad.
‐ Blonde?

22:50.970 --> 22:51.971
I know.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.973
I'm kinda happy
'cause people were saying
you look like me,

22:54.039 --> 22:56.942
so I need you to be blonde.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.745
‐ Yeah, I definitely need
to be blonde, we can have that.
‐ Yeah.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.046
‐ Now.
‐ I know.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.383
I definitely think
Eva Marie is trouble.

23:04.450 --> 23:05.985
I see it in her eyes.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.320
I see in
that little grin she does.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.322
I guess we're supposed
to follow your guys' lead

23:10.389 --> 23:12.324
since we're the newbies,
you guys are the veterans,
right?

23:12.391 --> 23:14.727
‐ That's right.
‐ And make sure
not to show us out.

23:15.294 --> 23:16.896
‐ Yeah.
‐ 'Cause then
the claws come out.

23:16.962 --> 23:18.631
Yup, can't wait
to see the blonde hair.

23:18.697 --> 23:20.065
I know.

23:25.437 --> 23:26.672
Hi, how are you doing?

23:26.739 --> 23:27.940
Hey, girl! Hey!

23:28.007 --> 23:29.575
‐ Wanna go eat?
‐ Oh, yes.

23:29.642 --> 23:32.144
I'm gonna go sit down
and have breakfast with Ariane

23:32.211 --> 23:34.980
to talk about what happened
between Vincent and Brodus,

23:35.047 --> 23:36.215
our tag team partner.

23:36.282 --> 23:38.217
It's something that has
to be addressed.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.319
Okay, so what's going on

23:40.386 --> 23:41.887
with the whole Vinny situation?

23:41.954 --> 23:42.988
Did you talk?

23:43.055 --> 23:45.224
Have you talked since
about that after that or‐‐

23:45.291 --> 23:47.359
I insisted he got blamed
for a mistake he made

23:47.426 --> 23:50.095
but he couldn't admit it
and be a man himself

23:50.162 --> 23:51.430
so he had to fix
someone to blame.

23:51.497 --> 23:52.965
Who is it? Me.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.336
That whole situation,
he was very wrong

23:57.403 --> 24:00.306
for the way he handled that
and the way he dealt with.

24:00.372 --> 24:02.574
But I think it wasn't right

24:02.641 --> 24:05.411
for Vinny to be back there
involved with it,

24:05.477 --> 24:06.779
wanna... Want to fight Brodus

24:06.845 --> 24:08.781
because that's our workplace
and‐‐

24:08.847 --> 24:11.183
Yeah, it's work.
But then he would've been a punk

24:11.250 --> 24:13.218
if he just let
some guy just disrespect me.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.554
This is our job,
he cannot go him

24:15.621 --> 24:17.456
in the back like that, like,
that can't happen again.

24:17.523 --> 24:19.558
That's... That's just it.

24:20.426 --> 24:21.560
Whatever, I'm over.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.635
All right, here we go.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.604
‐ Hi!
‐ Hi, who are you seeing today?

24:33.272 --> 24:34.373
I think it's Erica.

24:36.241 --> 24:39.511
So I'm like freaking out.
I gotta change my hair blonde.

24:39.578 --> 24:42.281
All right, let me go
and mix my stuff up

24:42.348 --> 24:44.049
‐ and then we'll start there.
‐ Okay.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.754
I can't even imagine me blonde.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.290
I'm looking at myself right now
and I can't imagine me blonde.

24:51.357 --> 24:53.659
I have red highlights
in my hair already

24:53.726 --> 24:56.261
so now the colors is just like,
"We have to strip your color."

24:56.328 --> 24:58.364
It's kind of scary.

24:59.064 --> 25:00.933
‐ Oh, hell no!
‐ They haven't even dye it.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.901
Oh, my god! My hair

25:04.470 --> 25:06.238
I'm not going blonde, I'm not.

25:07.106 --> 25:08.173
No way.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.843
It doesn't go
with my personality,
it's not who I am.

25:10.909 --> 25:13.112
I'm this lighten firecracker,

25:13.178 --> 25:15.314
blonde just does not work
with me at all.

25:15.381 --> 25:17.316
I look like the Lion King.

25:17.383 --> 25:18.684
I look like Mufasa.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.185
I can't do blonde.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.587
So you're just gonna go
against them.

25:21.653 --> 25:22.654
Yes.

25:23.589 --> 25:25.758
‐ Coming up.
I get the phone call
saying,

25:25.824 --> 25:27.126
"Jane want to see my hair."

25:27.192 --> 25:28.794
What would happen to blonde?

25:28.861 --> 25:31.030
Blonde just...
It cannot work for me.

25:33.799 --> 25:35.934
Why are you snapping with me?
I just answer your question.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.406
I don't appreciate
you have an attitude.

25:48.113 --> 25:49.948
Are you ready
for the color process?

25:50.015 --> 25:51.550
There's now way I can go blonde.

25:51.617 --> 25:53.185
I have to do red.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.421
‐ How red you wanna be? Fire?
‐ Rhianna red.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.556
Rhianna red? Exciting!

25:57.623 --> 26:00.159
Considering that this could
possibly cost your job,

26:00.225 --> 26:02.361
that's kinda scary. But‐‐

26:02.428 --> 26:03.896
‐ I got you girl, don't worry.
‐ I'm fine.

26:03.962 --> 26:04.997
Let's do it.

26:10.936 --> 26:13.839
Oh my god. I cannot believe
you are doing this.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.549
Oh my god.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.218
Oh my goodness!

26:26.618 --> 26:29.254
Eva Marie has finally come
to life, my friends.

26:29.321 --> 26:30.689
Oh my god.

26:31.457 --> 26:33.425
‐ We in here‐‐
‐ She's a red head.

26:33.492 --> 26:34.793
I love it!

26:34.860 --> 26:36.795
I absolutely love my hair.

26:36.862 --> 26:38.764
This screams Eva Marie.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.200
This is heat, this is fire,
just like me.

26:41.567 --> 26:42.801
There's not gonna be any mix up

26:42.868 --> 26:44.536
between me
and the Bellas at all.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.538
No, not at all.

26:53.011 --> 26:55.180
I'm so nervous.
‐ Breathe.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.381
It's game time.

26:56.448 --> 26:59.651
I get the phone call saying,
"Come down and meet Jane."

26:59.718 --> 27:01.086
'Cause she wants to see my hair.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.221
Here we go.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.026
Hi, Jane.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.995
Wow.

27:11.363 --> 27:12.965
What would happened to blonde?

27:13.398 --> 27:15.501
Blonde just...
It can't worked for me.

27:16.201 --> 27:17.669
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

27:17.736 --> 27:20.639
To me, Eva Marie is
all about attitude

27:20.706 --> 27:24.109
and feeling really good,
and I couldn't do the blonde.

27:27.246 --> 27:31.517
You know, I... I actually
like it, I'm gonna hate to say.

27:32.050 --> 27:33.585
I hate to say it but,

27:33.652 --> 27:35.354
not that I hate to say it.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.322
This worked out well,
this time,

27:37.389 --> 27:41.293
but in the future,
when we say something,
we mean it, okay?

27:41.360 --> 27:43.362
‐ Okay.
‐ You know, we know
what we're doing

27:43.428 --> 27:44.796
and that's
why we're directing you.

27:44.863 --> 27:48.033
So, you know, in the future
you got... You got to rely.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.735
‐ It's what is this about.
‐ Sure, it won't happen again.

27:49.801 --> 27:51.770
Thank God, Jane loves my hair.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.039
Now, I just gonna rock
the out of this hair

27:54.106 --> 27:57.409
and show them that this is
exactly what I needed to do.

27:57.843 --> 27:58.944
Now, lets go show the world.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.519
John Cena! John Cena!

28:08.820 --> 28:09.855
Hi guys.

28:10.155 --> 28:11.857
Whoa!

28:13.258 --> 28:15.794
‐ Thank you.
‐ You girls are very pretty.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.129
Thank you.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.897
Here's the new poster child!

28:18.964 --> 28:21.633
I thought she was supposed
to be this blonde bombshell

28:21.700 --> 28:25.103
and all the sudden
it's just fiery red hair,

28:25.170 --> 28:26.672
I mean, what?

28:27.673 --> 28:29.374
I'm WWE Diva Natalia

28:29.441 --> 28:33.078
and we are here
at the Wrestle Mania
Kick‐off Party, to bene‐‐

28:33.145 --> 28:34.913
to benefit‐‐yuck,
let's start over.

28:34.980 --> 28:36.748
I would love to walk
the red carpet, too. I mean,

28:36.815 --> 28:38.984
I would love to be with the rest
of the divas

28:39.051 --> 28:41.553
feeling like a princess
for the day but instead,

28:41.620 --> 28:44.289
it's like, Nattie's a good kid,
you know, let's have her work.

28:45.190 --> 28:46.758
Eva Marie and Jojo.

28:46.825 --> 28:48.126
Look at here, please!

28:49.094 --> 28:50.095
Here it goes again,

28:50.162 --> 28:51.863
like I never did have
those diva moments.

28:51.930 --> 28:54.700
I'm just, again,
on the outside looking in.

29:02.441 --> 29:03.508
It's really amazing!

29:03.609 --> 29:05.344
It's actually
our first red carpet.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.745
Oh, for real?
‐ Yeah.

29:06.812 --> 29:09.348
So, those two new girls
who just signed on

29:09.414 --> 29:14.152
and we're noticing
how they've only been
with WWE for three day.

29:14.219 --> 29:15.854
Look how comfortable they are.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.522
And they're walking around
like they own the place.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.791
Are there any secret rooms
in Met Life Stadium

29:19.858 --> 29:21.393
we can lock them in?

29:22.494 --> 29:23.495
Yes.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.164
We have to get
our intimidation on.

29:26.231 --> 29:28.367
We're veterans, they're newbies.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.835
There's a pecking order here.

29:29.901 --> 29:30.902
Go get them.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.172
I don't wanna photobomb
but I don't have a champagne.

29:35.374 --> 29:36.742
So you gotta go,
I think it's free,

29:36.808 --> 29:38.477
Get another champagne for two,

29:38.543 --> 29:40.245
and I'm really thirsty.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.814
Guys, let me be taking photos,
they don't know who you are yet.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.884
Are you kidding me?
Are you... Are you serious?

29:46.285 --> 29:47.753
Like, bitch, please?

29:47.819 --> 29:49.421
Oh, just one second, girls.

29:50.989 --> 29:52.557
Oh, wait, one more.

29:55.827 --> 29:58.697
I take it as initiation
or whatever,

29:58.764 --> 30:00.899
but that will only happen
one time.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.301
That's it.

30:02.367 --> 30:04.002
Thank you.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.171
Happy?
Thank you so much.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.316
I'm so hungry
after rehearsal, too.

30:17.749 --> 30:19.184
I'm starving.

30:20.018 --> 30:22.621
‐ Oh!
‐ Oh, papi!

30:23.288 --> 30:24.890
Do you guys have hot sauce?

30:25.090 --> 30:26.458
We do, I'll bring it up.

30:26.525 --> 30:27.659
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

30:30.696 --> 30:31.730
That's cool.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.232
‐ I can't wait.
‐ About?

30:34.833 --> 30:36.401
You're so picky.

30:37.636 --> 30:42.774
Obviously, it'd be fun
if I can go ring shopping and...

30:44.276 --> 30:46.078
know that I have a wedding
in my future but...

30:48.246 --> 30:49.314
I'm excited for you.

30:49.381 --> 30:52.584
Do you ever get worried
that John wouldn't marry you
in the future

30:52.651 --> 30:54.820
‐ 'cause he's already
been married?
‐ Yeah.

30:56.121 --> 30:57.556
It's him.

30:57.956 --> 31:01.460
I like to think, if this man,
who's so perfect,

31:01.526 --> 31:03.261
like, doesn't wanna get married,

31:03.328 --> 31:04.896
but I wanna get married,

31:04.963 --> 31:07.199
so it's like I have
this battle now inside

31:07.265 --> 31:10.001
where it's like when do
I walk away

31:10.068 --> 31:12.137
or do I look like,
I'm even crying right now.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.373
‐ But‐‐
‐ Really? Aw!

31:14.840 --> 31:16.308
it just makes me upset.

31:16.742 --> 31:18.076
Don't cry.
‐ It's okay.

31:18.143 --> 31:20.412
Mama makes this
when you get sad.

31:20.479 --> 31:21.813
Just, I.‐‐sorry.

31:23.248 --> 31:24.249
I just...

31:25.050 --> 31:27.285
It's sad to think
if he's not my life one day,

31:27.352 --> 31:29.020
'cause I'm so happy.

31:29.087 --> 31:30.689
You have no idea
what the future holds

31:30.756 --> 31:31.757
for both of you.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.091
It sucks.

31:36.461 --> 31:37.529
Coming up.

31:37.596 --> 31:40.165
Two people feel like they're
meant for each other.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.500
Why not marry that person?

31:41.566 --> 31:44.569
You do know that I've...
I've tried that once.

31:47.205 --> 31:48.807
Our gear is still not even done.

31:48.874 --> 31:50.275
We have nothing to wear.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.577
Hello? Are you freaking
kidding me right now?

32:01.253 --> 32:03.221
Yo, yo, yo!

32:03.288 --> 32:04.656
Hey, girl.
‐ What's up?

32:04.756 --> 32:06.525
‐ You talked to your man yet?
‐ Jesus!

32:06.591 --> 32:08.026
Get off my back.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.195
When I get a chance,
I'll talk to him.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.632
Ever since I talked to Ariane
about the Vincent situation,

32:13.698 --> 32:17.002
things between us have been
a little weird.

32:17.068 --> 32:19.070
Why are you snapping with me?
I'm just asking you a question.

32:19.137 --> 32:20.639
You already
talked to me about it

32:20.705 --> 32:21.973
and now I'm being irritated

32:22.040 --> 32:23.542
‐ 'cause I don't want
to talk to him.
‐ You're always so defensive...

32:23.608 --> 32:25.477
‐ all the time for no reason.
‐ I am not!

32:25.544 --> 32:27.345
‐ You are! Look at you!
All I ask you is
‐ I am not!

32:27.412 --> 32:28.413
you talk to Vinny.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.650
‐ And you're gonna tell me‐‐
‐ And you're like I don't have
a time, when I get a time, and‐‐

32:33.919 --> 32:35.520
‐ And you all that.
‐ And walking off and that,

32:35.587 --> 32:37.722
it's just too much.
Your'e angry right now.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.691
I'm not, just because you're up
in my Kool aid.

32:39.758 --> 32:42.360
Thanks to Vinny, he's a part,
it's now my Kool‐Aid too.

32:42.427 --> 32:44.429
Because that what happened
affects me too.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.198
‐ Okay, I understand that
but I also have
‐ just appealing as a friend,

32:46.264 --> 32:47.866
‐ valid reason
‐ just talk to your man.

32:47.933 --> 32:49.301
on why he do, what he did.

32:49.701 --> 32:51.470
Well, I'm not trying to argue
with you about this.

32:51.536 --> 32:53.371
I love you, but as a friend,

32:53.438 --> 32:56.074
I think you have
some deep rooted issues.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.310
I deal with it 'cause I love you
and you're my girl

32:58.376 --> 33:00.378
but everybody else
doesn't understand that.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.617
I'm not trying to make you feel
like a crap but‐‐

33:06.418 --> 33:08.520
Okay. Well, I talk to Vinny‐‐

33:08.587 --> 33:11.356
Talk to him when you're ready
to talk to him, all right?

33:13.124 --> 33:14.259
You need a therapist.

33:23.869 --> 33:27.038
'Cause I'm busy,
you think?
Yup.

33:27.105 --> 33:30.008
Tonight,
John and I are going to dinner.

33:30.075 --> 33:31.877
And I just need to know

33:31.943 --> 33:35.046
if there's a possibility
that marriage is in our future.

33:35.113 --> 33:38.083
It's difficult to talk to you
while I'm staring at you.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.986
Your legs and boobs
are in front now.

33:41.052 --> 33:43.288
Can we just be serious
for five minutes?

33:43.655 --> 33:44.823
Okay, seriously, what's up?

33:46.892 --> 33:48.059
I don't know.

33:48.493 --> 33:51.630
I just feel that if someone
wants to be with someone
forever,

33:51.696 --> 33:53.732
like, why not marry that person?

33:55.133 --> 33:56.835
You do know that I've...

33:57.202 --> 33:58.537
I tried that once.

33:58.603 --> 34:00.739
That's why I feel like
I have this battle

34:00.805 --> 34:03.308
because here I'm so happy
with this man and what,

34:03.375 --> 34:04.409
I leave him?

34:04.476 --> 34:06.545
What if I never find someone
to be happy with,

34:06.611 --> 34:08.179
who I have this much fun with?

34:08.612 --> 34:11.917
Both marriage and family are
very difficult obstacles for me.

34:12.183 --> 34:14.619
You have no idea how much
you've changed me as a person.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.788
I feel so

34:16.855 --> 34:19.123
because there are certain things
I can't do but‐‐

34:24.129 --> 34:26.364
Because a random dinner
on a thursday night,

34:27.197 --> 34:28.800
or fishing in a morning,

34:29.100 --> 34:30.869
when it's pouring rain,

34:34.539 --> 34:37.342
I would never open my home
or my life to anybody else.

34:38.842 --> 34:40.645
You make me wanna do
all of these things.

34:43.848 --> 34:45.583
Its just...
'cause Brie and Bryan,

34:45.650 --> 34:48.887
do you know this ring shopping
and talking about their future,

34:48.954 --> 34:51.523
I guess this just skids
in your head, but I don't know.

34:51.590 --> 34:52.591
It's all right.

34:52.657 --> 34:54.492
In the end, I do see

34:54.559 --> 34:56.828
and feel the love
that John has for me.

34:56.895 --> 34:58.563
And so I need to be patient.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.599
‐ One day at a time.
‐ One day at a time.

35:16.681 --> 35:18.183
We are at Wrestle Mania!

35:20.685 --> 35:23.154
I'm so excited for the match.

35:23.221 --> 35:24.689
Look at them all piling in,

35:24.756 --> 35:25.790
it's insane.

35:25.857 --> 35:29.561
Wrestle Mania is
the biggest event in our career.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.767
Eighty thousand fans
in attendance.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.369
Millions of viewers,

35:37.435 --> 35:40.505
it's one of the biggest events
that happens in the world.

35:50.048 --> 35:52.283
Hey!

35:52.350 --> 35:53.885
‐ You're so excited?
‐ Oh my god!

35:53.952 --> 35:55.320
We're here at Wrestle Mania,

35:55.387 --> 35:58.056
eighty thousand people
are in this stadium.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.428
I'm living my dream
at this moment.

36:04.729 --> 36:08.366
The following
contest is for the WWE:

36:08.433 --> 36:11.836
Tag Team Championship.

36:13.938 --> 36:15.507
Oh, I'm just so nervous
right now.

36:15.573 --> 36:17.942
Wrestle Mania...

36:24.149 --> 36:25.150
He was good.

36:25.216 --> 36:27.952
Finishes him!

36:28.453 --> 36:30.655
This is obviously‐‐

36:30.722 --> 36:32.157
Here comes the Flying Goat.

36:32.223 --> 36:33.491
Oh.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.229
Daniels Bryan Diving Headbutt...

36:41.066 --> 36:43.034
Still the Tag Team Champions.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.473
Bellas are back.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.141
I love it!

36:50.208 --> 36:52.243
I love it guys! Have fun!

36:52.310 --> 36:53.745
Thank you!

36:58.249 --> 36:59.350
Two minutes, ladies.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.486
You said that two minutes ago.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.054
Oh, I'm sorry, I know I did.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.124
I am so nervous right now.

37:06.191 --> 37:07.792
Our gear is still not even done,

37:07.859 --> 37:09.260
we have nothing to wear.

37:09.327 --> 37:11.663
We have to go now,
I'm really going out with these.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.164
And I will be going out
with nothing.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.933
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

37:14.999 --> 37:17.368
Looks like though,
I'll be walking out naked today.

37:17.435 --> 37:19.037
You know what, right now,
it's really not the time.

37:19.104 --> 37:20.805
So I'd just suggest
that you keep pushing.

37:20.872 --> 37:22.741
‐ Sh!
‐ No, you shush!

37:22.807 --> 37:24.943
‐ We haven't any wardrobe
malfunction, are we?
‐ No.

37:25.009 --> 37:26.411
We might have
a wardrobe malfunction.

37:26.478 --> 37:27.612
Hang on.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.914
Hello! Are you freaking
kidding me right now?

37:32.817 --> 37:34.419
‐ We're up next.
‐ Yes.

37:34.486 --> 37:35.620
Our costumes aren't ready.

37:35.687 --> 37:36.888
They were supposed to be up,
right now.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.090
What?
‐ There's nothing worst
that could've happened.

37:52.070 --> 37:53.772
‐ We're up next.
‐ Yes.

37:53.838 --> 37:56.207
Give me a minute,
I'm going fast as I can.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.076
Our costumes aren't ready.

37:58.143 --> 37:59.844
This is the most important night

37:59.911 --> 38:02.814
and the most important match
of my career.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.519
All right, good to go.

38:07.585 --> 38:08.887
Okay, thank you.
Come, come on.
‐Okay, thank you.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.196
He's out!

38:23.434 --> 38:25.537
We worked so hard
all year long

38:25.603 --> 38:28.239
and finally the pay off
is about to happen.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.943
Okay, the Bellas are up.
Bellas are up! Bellas are up!

38:32.010 --> 38:33.478
Oh my god.

38:56.401 --> 38:57.969
I know something's
not right here

38:58.036 --> 39:00.939
because all of a sudden
I see John Cena in the ring.

39:02.841 --> 39:03.842
This is supposed to be

39:03.908 --> 39:05.810
where the girls have
their match.

39:05.877 --> 39:07.612
This is supposed
to be their moment.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.681
‐ They were supposed to be up,
right now.
‐ What?

39:09.747 --> 39:11.549
I wanna go downstairs
to find out what's going on.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.885
You have,
we're all good to go.
Yeah.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.555
When are you guys going out?

39:17.622 --> 39:19.057
Because you guys were supposed
to be up for this.

39:19.123 --> 39:21.159
‐ Never.
‐ We got cut.

39:21.226 --> 39:22.760
Oh my god.

39:35.139 --> 39:37.242
Hey guys,
when are you guys going out?

39:37.308 --> 39:38.943
‐ You guys were supposed
to be up before this‐‐
‐ Never.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.511
We got cut.

39:43.014 --> 39:44.515
‐ Match before us took off.
‐ Yeah.

39:44.582 --> 39:45.617
‐Yeah.
‐You're kidding.

39:45.683 --> 39:47.552
It is that
the natural force went..

39:47.952 --> 39:49.787
- ‐ you know, way over.
- So sorry, you guys.

39:49.854 --> 39:52.857
I feel like, if I show
any emotion, I'm gonna lose it.

39:52.924 --> 39:54.525
I'm just gonna freaking lose it.

39:55.526 --> 39:57.362
This was going to be
Brie and I

39:57.428 --> 39:59.430
first Wrestle Mania
to wrestle in.

39:59.497 --> 40:02.100
For it to be taken away,
it's just... It hurts.

40:02.166 --> 40:04.435
You worked that hard
and then you have this happened.

40:04.502 --> 40:05.503
It sucks.

40:05.570 --> 40:06.638
There's so many
different elements

40:06.704 --> 40:09.607
especially on live TV
that everything can change.

40:09.674 --> 40:11.776
So this match
that we had carefully planned

40:11.843 --> 40:13.444
and worked out during the day

40:13.511 --> 40:15.113
is all of the sudden
not happening.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.348
I'll take a second.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.053
I'll check on her.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.659
There's nothing worst
that could've happen

40:27.725 --> 40:30.662
than us getting cut
from Wrestle Mania.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.398
Are you okay?

40:33.464 --> 40:34.632
Yeah, I'm just...

40:37.502 --> 40:39.103
This is our whole life,
our whole world.

40:39.170 --> 40:42.707
We're here around these people,
in this business, in this job,

40:42.774 --> 40:44.175
more than our own family.

40:44.242 --> 40:45.677
Like, we put so much into it

40:45.743 --> 40:48.446
and what we want out of it is
Wrestle Mania.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.249
And when we don't get that
it's... It's devastating.

40:51.316 --> 40:53.051
I only have a couple
more years here, really.

40:53.117 --> 40:54.852
I wanna have kids and stuff, so,

40:54.919 --> 40:57.555
you know, like, four more years
I'm gonna be 30.

40:57.622 --> 41:00.959
Like, Am I still gonna be like
chasing Wrestle Mania?

41:01.025 --> 41:02.694
We, oh, get that mania!

41:03.194 --> 41:04.429
We gotta get that mania.

41:04.729 --> 41:07.465
Come on, let's get dressed
and get fitted beauty, baby.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.535
I love you, girl.

41:10.601 --> 41:11.602
Try again next year.

41:11.869 --> 41:12.971
The situation with Vincent

41:13.037 --> 41:14.272
it kinda got out of control.

41:14.339 --> 41:16.274
That's something
that definitely to be discussed

41:16.341 --> 41:18.076
and it's something
I'm gonna speak
to him about.

41:18.376 --> 41:20.211
But Trinity is my girl.

41:20.278 --> 41:22.447
I know that she's here for me
to work things out.

41:22.513 --> 41:23.681
And that we can do it together,

41:23.748 --> 41:24.983
that we're a group,
we're a team.

41:25.049 --> 41:27.352
And that no matter, whether,
if it's raining or shining,

41:27.418 --> 41:29.253
we have each other
and we support one another.

41:29.721 --> 41:31.789
Girl, this week has been
so stressful.

41:31.856 --> 41:34.592
I'm gotta go get a drink,
or two, or three, or four.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.435
This season on Total Divas.

41:45.903 --> 41:48.706
- What happened to Vegas...
- Stays in Vegas!

41:49.307 --> 41:51.042
Oh!

41:51.976 --> 41:52.977
Hey, boys.

41:53.244 --> 41:55.513
We have to work the face,
we have to work the camera.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.215
In the business we are in,

41:57.281 --> 41:58.783
you're supposed to look
a certain way.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.485
No wonder people call you fat
on Twitter, Nicole.

42:00.551 --> 42:01.853
Shut up, Brie.

42:01.919 --> 42:03.287
I'm asking you
to meet my family.

42:03.354 --> 42:04.689
I'm also asking them
to meet you.

42:04.756 --> 42:06.924
I'm like losing my breath,
freaking out.

42:06.991 --> 42:09.193
I've always just had
really small boobs.

42:09.260 --> 42:10.828
Let me see
those puppies of yours.

42:10.895 --> 42:13.097
What happened to my boobies?

42:13.164 --> 42:14.499
This things float.

42:14.565 --> 42:16.067
Huh, who knew?

42:18.269 --> 42:21.406
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

42:22.407 --> 42:25.009
They want you
to do a photoshoot.
‐ Shut up!

42:25.076 --> 42:26.878
Maxim wants me to shoot
for them.

42:26.944 --> 42:29.514
I have to say I feel
like a real diva.

42:29.580 --> 42:32.150
When I feel like people
are threatening my spot,

42:32.216 --> 42:34.585
well, then you'll see
the lion come out.

42:35.253 --> 42:37.121
‐ Ouch.
‐ Nicole's gonna be so mad

42:37.188 --> 42:38.923
You are a grown ass woman.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.091
You're just so ungrateful,

42:40.158 --> 42:41.426
it really makes me
hate you guys.

42:41.492 --> 42:43.127
You realized how selfish
something like that is?

42:43.227 --> 42:44.495
Justin's in his
thirties.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.764
JoJo is setting herself up
to have her heart broken.

42:46.831 --> 42:47.932
I'm done.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.534
You don't care
about our relationship at all.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.370
I come home and you give
me a noogie on the forehead,
drib me like I'm your friend.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.138
Get ready to eat dinner
in an hour.

42:54.205 --> 42:57.141
You don't take off
an engagement ring
for business meeting.

42:57.208 --> 42:59.377
This has gotten so out of hand.

42:59.877 --> 43:01.379
You embarrassed the company.

43:01.446 --> 43:02.680
You'll be gone.

43:02.747 --> 43:04.549
Heads up, it won't be with you
all the time.

43:04.615 --> 43:06.317
I will, if you give me
a chance.

43:09.020 --> 43:10.088
What do you make of this?

43:10.154 --> 43:11.322
Just staring down here.

43:12.156 --> 43:14.158
‐ Wow!
‐ My goodness!

43:14.959 --> 43:17.095
I just don't know
what his sacrifices are for me.

43:17.862 --> 43:19.997
It's just too much for me
to handle.

43:20.465 --> 43:22.667
Nattie's going low blows
and I'm about to snap.

43:24.268 --> 43:25.803
That wasn't supposed to happen.

43:27.839 --> 43:29.807
JoJo.
‐ First count concussion.

43:30.241 --> 43:31.642
My whole life is back home

43:31.709 --> 43:33.077
and I can't even do anything.

43:33.144 --> 43:35.346
Uh‐oh!
‐ It's pretty significant
fracture.

43:35.413 --> 43:36.747
My wrestling career is over.

43:36.814 --> 43:38.616
‐ I'm done with you.
‐ No, I'm done with you.

43:38.683 --> 43:40.184
‐ You just pushed me.
‐ What you gonna do, huh?

43:40.251 --> 43:41.519
Stop, just stop!
