WEBVTT

00:12.675 --> 00:14.176
Are you sure
you're okay to do this?

00:15.712 --> 00:19.649
Mr. Lowe,
you're telling me...

00:21.418 --> 00:25.154
that my son
may be in there.

00:25.187 --> 00:27.123
Are there any family members
or friends...

00:27.156 --> 00:29.258
I'm here.

01:20.042 --> 01:22.545
He was not in a gang.

01:22.579 --> 01:24.914
He was wearing
Crip colors.

01:24.947 --> 01:28.885
Mr. Lowe, I know--

01:28.918 --> 01:32.188
I knew my son.

01:33.523 --> 01:37.427
The jacket was a Christmas
present from an uncle.

01:37.460 --> 01:39.562
He was not in a gang.

01:39.596 --> 01:42.632
It is possible he was mistaken
for a Crip.

01:42.665 --> 01:44.534
Do you know who shot him?

01:44.567 --> 01:46.068
We think so, yes.

01:46.102 --> 01:50.740
Please get this person,
Mr. Lowe.

01:50.773 --> 01:54.344
I'm asking you
as his mother.

01:54.377 --> 01:57.514
Please get whoever
did this.

01:57.547 --> 02:00.583
I will.

02:03.553 --> 02:07.757
(music playing)

02:54.170 --> 02:55.738
It wasn't me.

02:55.772 --> 02:59.609
LESTER: I think we should just
give a statement, Ellenor.

02:59.642 --> 03:01.344
That is not
a good idea, Lester.

03:01.378 --> 03:03.346
LESTER: But if we don't talk,

03:03.380 --> 03:05.382
they'll just think
he's guilty.

03:05.415 --> 03:07.183
Which I'm not.

03:07.216 --> 03:08.518
FRUTT: What are you going
to tell them, Steven?

03:08.551 --> 03:10.286
that you and Terrance
just happened

03:10.320 --> 03:11.721
to be driving
through at the time?

03:11.754 --> 03:14.457
It's the truth.
Why don't you believe me?

03:14.491 --> 03:16.225
Steven, whether or not I do,

03:16.258 --> 03:18.695
you will not be
believed by the police.

03:18.728 --> 03:21.263
You've already been involved
in two prior drive-bys.

03:21.298 --> 03:24.233
I was not involved.
I happened to be in the car,

03:24.266 --> 03:26.102
but I had no part
in either of them.

03:26.135 --> 03:29.138
What about me?
I got no record.

03:29.171 --> 03:31.007
They're going to think you're
covering for your brother,

03:31.040 --> 03:33.009
or even worse,
that you're involved.

03:33.042 --> 03:34.311
Wait, whose side
are you on?

03:34.344 --> 03:37.046
FRUTT: Guys, hold on.

03:37.079 --> 03:39.482
At this point, you two
are the only suspects--

03:39.516 --> 03:41.784
specifically you, Steven.

03:41.818 --> 03:43.953
Now, they don't want to talk
to you to see if you can

03:43.986 --> 03:45.988
join them in their search
for justice.

03:46.022 --> 03:48.925
They want you to say something
incriminating

03:48.958 --> 03:52.429
or nail you down to a story
that they can check out.

03:52.462 --> 03:54.864
As your lawyer,
I am telling you both--

03:54.897 --> 03:57.834
I am imploring you--

03:57.867 --> 04:00.337
not to say a word.

04:00.370 --> 04:04.273
You think I did it?

04:04.307 --> 04:07.109
Once again, I don't know
what to believe at this point.

04:07.143 --> 04:08.745
You told them you were
in the area

04:08.778 --> 04:09.779
because you had a flat,

04:09.812 --> 04:12.549
but no flat tire was found
in the back of your car.

04:12.582 --> 04:14.884
STEVEN: That's because
I was scared.

04:14.917 --> 04:17.654
and I just got out
as quick as I could.

04:17.687 --> 04:19.922
I knew I was
on Crips turf.

04:19.956 --> 04:21.524
I used to be a Blood.

04:21.558 --> 04:23.192
Well, Terrance,
in his statement,

04:23.225 --> 04:25.995
forgot to mention
the flat tire.

04:26.028 --> 04:27.997
I also know
that ex-gang members

04:28.030 --> 04:30.232
don't get the benefit
of the doubt.

04:30.266 --> 04:33.836
You're talking
is not going to help,

04:33.870 --> 04:35.305
so I will advise you

04:35.338 --> 04:38.675
one last time not to.

04:49.185 --> 04:51.788
WOMAN: The Commonwealth vs.
Frank Vaughan.

04:51.821 --> 04:53.723
breaking and entering,
trespassing.

04:53.756 --> 04:55.392
CARLTON: Jeff Carlton
for the Commonwealth.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.327
His P. D.'s
a no-show again.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.497
Ms. Dole, how delightful
to see you again.

05:00.530 --> 05:02.632
I'm just filing some papers
with your clerk.

05:02.665 --> 05:04.534
JUDGE: Step up, counselor.

05:04.567 --> 05:05.802
take a moment.

05:05.835 --> 05:08.505
Maybe we can conference this
and be done with it.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.310
Lindsay Dole--
I'll be representing you.

05:13.343 --> 05:14.444
I didn't do anything.

05:14.477 --> 05:16.145
I'll get a trial date set,
then we can meet,

05:16.178 --> 05:19.115
and you can tell me
all about it.

05:19.148 --> 05:21.518
One second.
Your Honor?

05:21.551 --> 05:23.986
This complaint doesn't even
allege a criminal act.

05:24.020 --> 05:26.055
The door to the home
where Mr. Vaughan was found

05:26.088 --> 05:27.524
had been open all day.
He was just sitting

05:27.557 --> 05:28.925
in the doorway
of an empty house.

05:28.958 --> 05:31.328
It was private property,
and the lock was broken.

05:31.361 --> 05:32.629
I think we can infer
that the defendant--

05:32.662 --> 05:34.564
We can infer?
The neighbors called the police

05:34.597 --> 05:36.566
because they knew Mr. Vaughan
didn't belong there.

05:36.599 --> 05:38.668
DOLE: Hello? According
to the incident report,

05:38.701 --> 05:40.603
he was arrested
only because

05:40.637 --> 05:42.439
the police thought maybe
he was on drugs,

05:42.472 --> 05:44.574
which he wasn't,
according to subsequent tests.

05:44.607 --> 05:46.275
CARLTON: Look, the guy
is sitting there in a house--

05:46.309 --> 05:49.746
JUDGE: Come on, Mr. Carlton,
if that's all you've got--

05:49.779 --> 05:52.882
Is it?

05:52.915 --> 05:55.785
The charges against Mr. Vaughan
are dismissed without prejudice.

05:55.818 --> 05:58.455
You can always refile
if you get anything more,

05:58.488 --> 06:00.623
but please don't waste my time.

06:00.657 --> 06:01.658
(gavel bangs)

06:05.528 --> 06:09.131
Okay, you're free to go.

06:09.165 --> 06:10.433
Not with me.

06:10.467 --> 06:11.834
This way, pal.

06:18.708 --> 06:20.977
I thought you said
you knew who did this.

06:21.010 --> 06:22.979
We think we do,

06:23.012 --> 06:24.881
but we don't have
any real evidence.

06:24.914 --> 06:26.483
We can place the car
in the area--

06:26.516 --> 06:28.017
But weren't there
any witnesses?

06:28.050 --> 06:30.853
Only the brother,
and he's not saying anything.

06:30.887 --> 06:31.854
with the gang shootings,

06:31.888 --> 06:34.023
the witnesses usually
don't come forward.

06:34.056 --> 06:37.894
I told you,
my son was not in a gang.

06:37.927 --> 06:40.897
LOWE: I understand that,
but the shooter is or was.

06:42.164 --> 06:44.801
You'll just have to be
patient, Ms. Fletcher.

06:49.572 --> 06:52.742
You don't think you're going
to get him, do you?

06:52.775 --> 06:54.844
It's still very early
in the investigation.

06:54.877 --> 06:57.013
FLETCHER: Do you...

06:57.046 --> 06:59.582
think you'll get him,
Mr. Lowe?

07:03.386 --> 07:05.221
I don't know.

07:11.193 --> 07:12.929
Mike, anything?

07:12.962 --> 07:14.531
We combed the area.
We haven't been able

07:14.564 --> 07:16.333
to scare up anybody
who saw anything,

07:16.366 --> 07:19.969
but Steven Miller's
best friend was shot

07:20.002 --> 07:22.204
and killed by a Crip
two weeks ago.

07:22.238 --> 07:24.441
So he had motive.

07:24.907 --> 07:25.742
Where is he now?

07:25.775 --> 07:26.709
RANDALL: Both are still
in custody,

07:26.743 --> 07:28.445
Although Ellenor Frutt's
all over us on that.

07:31.781 --> 07:33.182
All right.

07:33.215 --> 07:34.584
Release him.

07:34.617 --> 07:37.620
Wait until they get home.
I'll get a warrant for Steven,

07:37.654 --> 07:39.356
You can re-arrest him there.

07:39.389 --> 07:42.592
Then you can do a protective
search of the house for weapons.

07:42.625 --> 07:45.662
With any luck,
you turn up the gun.

07:45.695 --> 07:47.930
Will that justify
searching the whole house?

07:47.964 --> 07:48.931
LOWE: He's a gang member.

07:48.965 --> 07:50.867
other gang members' weapons
could be present.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.402
Just do it.

07:52.435 --> 07:54.637
We'll worry about the fourth
amendment issues later.

07:54.671 --> 07:56.205
FRUTT: Alan, what's going on?

07:56.238 --> 07:57.940
You can't keep holding them
in perpetuity.

07:57.974 --> 08:01.110
We're releasing your clients,
Ellenor. They're free to go.

08:01.143 --> 08:02.078
Really.

08:08.184 --> 08:09.486
What do you mean
he just showed up?

08:09.519 --> 08:11.721
With Lindsay's card.

08:13.556 --> 08:14.791
What's your name, sir?

08:17.794 --> 08:20.330
Frank?

08:20.363 --> 08:22.231
I want to hire you.

08:22.264 --> 08:23.866
Well--

08:23.900 --> 08:24.767
Who is he?

08:24.801 --> 08:26.603
The Court appointment
I told you about.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.204
You don't need me
anymore, Frank.

08:28.237 --> 08:29.839
The charges were dropped.

08:29.872 --> 08:34.076
No, no, I want you
to help me find Andrea.

08:34.110 --> 08:36.212
I can--
I can pay you.

08:36.245 --> 08:37.279
DOLE: Who's Andrea?

08:37.313 --> 08:40.482
She's my daughter.
She's 3 years old.

08:40.517 --> 08:44.053
I had a baby.
She's my daughter.

08:47.056 --> 08:48.391
And she's gone?

08:48.425 --> 08:49.692
Yeah.

08:49.726 --> 08:53.029
Lindsay, he's got release
papers from Cedar Junction.

08:53.062 --> 08:55.865
And a bus ticket from Walpole
dated November 12th.

08:57.367 --> 08:59.402
Frank, have you been
in prison?

08:59.436 --> 09:01.404
Yeah.
The police lied.

09:01.438 --> 09:04.140
They lied
to everybody.

09:04.173 --> 09:05.442
Hey, Lucy,
did you page me?

09:05.475 --> 09:08.110
Yes. You got a call
from Lester Miller.

09:08.144 --> 09:09.912
Lester?
Was there a message?

09:09.946 --> 09:11.448
The police
are at his house.

09:19.255 --> 09:22.325
Can you help me find
Andrea?

09:22.359 --> 09:23.960
She's my daughter.

09:44.046 --> 09:45.515
Say nothing.
Don't say a word.

09:45.548 --> 09:46.449
That goes for both of you.

09:46.483 --> 09:49.786
I'll meet you down
at the police station.

09:49.819 --> 09:50.920
What the hell is this?

09:50.953 --> 09:52.489
Arrest warrant.
murder for Steven,

09:52.522 --> 09:54.424
possession of controlled
substance for Terrance.

09:54.457 --> 09:55.358
Where's your
search warrant?

09:55.392 --> 09:58.260
Exigent circumstances
to arrest, no time.

09:58.294 --> 10:01.263
This arrest is a pretext
so you can search his house.

10:01.297 --> 10:03.733
LOWE: We believe that the older
brother committed a murder.

10:03.766 --> 10:05.768
You had him in your custody.
Why did you release him?

10:05.802 --> 10:08.438
We decided not to press charges,
then we changed our minds.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.209
I am going to have this
kicked so fast.

10:13.242 --> 10:14.911
Do what you go to do,
Ellenor.

10:14.944 --> 10:16.178
Why are your men
still in there?

10:16.212 --> 10:18.348
Both of the suspects
are in your custody.

10:18.381 --> 10:20.783
It's a protective sweep of
the house for officers' safety.

10:20.817 --> 10:22.251
You are looking
for the gun.

10:22.284 --> 10:24.687
This is prosecutorial
misconduct, Alan.

10:24.721 --> 10:26.623
Ellenor, why don't you go back
to your office

10:26.656 --> 10:27.924
and draft your motion
to dismiss?

10:27.957 --> 10:30.560
That's what you do.
We'll do what we do, okay?

10:30.593 --> 10:31.994
You know what?

10:32.028 --> 10:33.830
If there is a gun,
I hope you find it.

10:33.863 --> 10:36.098
Because then I can suppress,
and you can rest assured,

10:36.132 --> 10:38.501
it will never
come into evidence.

10:38.535 --> 10:40.069
There you go.

10:49.178 --> 10:50.347
FRUTT: What he did was,

10:50.380 --> 10:52.649
by bringing the arrest warrant
here to your house,

10:52.682 --> 10:55.585
he could arguably look through
at least part of the house

10:55.618 --> 10:56.619
without a search warrant,

10:56.653 --> 11:00.056
which he probably couldn't
have gotten otherwise.

11:00.089 --> 11:01.123
He was looking
for the gun.

11:01.157 --> 11:02.659
But they arrested Terrance.

11:02.692 --> 11:06.228
I know, but I'm--
Ellenor, Terrance has--

11:06.262 --> 11:08.565
He has a right start
scholarship.

11:08.598 --> 11:10.667
He could lose
his whole education

11:10.700 --> 11:13.336
if he's busted on drugs.

11:13.370 --> 11:14.804
I'm going to be in Court
at 3:00.

11:14.837 --> 11:16.339
I am going to try
and get that kid.

11:16.373 --> 11:19.241
They just think we're
a gang family, don't they?

11:19.275 --> 11:22.545
We're not a gang family.

11:22.579 --> 11:26.082
We're not.

11:26.115 --> 11:27.884
LOWE: Unfortunately,
we didn't find anything

11:27.917 --> 11:29.151
to connect him
to the murder,

11:29.185 --> 11:31.354
but we did get some leverage
on the younger brother.

11:31.388 --> 11:32.822
We'll try
to force him to talk.

11:32.855 --> 11:35.291
Brothers don't talk,
Mr. Lowe.

11:35.325 --> 11:37.327
We're doing everything
we can.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.496
I wish
I could believe that.

11:42.365 --> 11:44.233
See those children?

11:44.266 --> 11:46.268
In addition to now
not having an older brother,

11:46.303 --> 11:48.338
they don't have a father.

11:48.371 --> 11:50.407
He was killed
in a hit-and-run.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.675
The police never caught
who did it.

11:52.709 --> 11:56.579
As far as I'm concerned,
they never really tried.

11:56.613 --> 12:00.583
I know we're not a priority,
Mr. Lowe.

12:00.617 --> 12:02.485
Ms. Fletcher,

12:02.519 --> 12:04.887
I give you my word

12:04.921 --> 12:07.156
I will do whatever I can.

12:15.097 --> 12:17.066
He served 15 years
of a life sentence.

12:17.099 --> 12:17.900
For what?

12:17.934 --> 12:19.502
Rape and murder.

12:19.536 --> 12:22.305
DNA tests just cleared him.
They expunged his record,

12:22.339 --> 12:23.205
let him go.

12:23.239 --> 12:26.208
What about--
Do we know where he lives?

12:26.242 --> 12:29.679
BERLUTI: He's homeless.
He's been out of prison a week.

12:29.712 --> 12:31.080
I contacted
his trial attorney.

12:31.113 --> 12:34.216
He does have
a daughter Andrea.

12:34.250 --> 12:35.385
Only she's not 3.

12:35.418 --> 12:36.919
How old is she?
18.

12:36.953 --> 12:40.390
I've got an address
on her.

12:40.423 --> 12:43.660
The murder and rape
Frank was cleared of,

12:43.693 --> 12:45.127
Andrea's mother.

12:50.733 --> 12:53.235
FRUTT: If he had enough evidence
to get a search warrant,

12:53.269 --> 12:54.504
why didn't he do so

12:54.537 --> 12:56.005
while the suspect
was still in custody?

12:56.038 --> 12:58.608
LOWE: As I explained
to Ms. Frutt, we first declined

12:58.641 --> 13:01.210
to press charges, and then
thought better of that decision.

13:01.243 --> 13:03.179
Yes, choosing
to re-arrest him at home

13:03.212 --> 13:05.882
where you could conveniently
but illegally conduct a search.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.317
Your characterization,
not mine.

13:07.350 --> 13:10.052
WHITE: Mr. Lowe, why'd you
suddenly change your mind

13:10.086 --> 13:11.521
after the suspect
was released?

13:11.554 --> 13:13.956
I first thought we'd wait
to collect more evidence,

13:13.990 --> 13:16.326
Your Honor, but then
I considered the threat

13:16.359 --> 13:18.795
to society
letting him stay at large,

13:18.828 --> 13:21.297
and I decided better
to continue the investigation

13:21.331 --> 13:22.532
with him in custody.

13:22.565 --> 13:25.134
And what exactly
is your evidence

13:25.167 --> 13:26.969
that Steven Miller
committed murder?

13:27.003 --> 13:29.138
LOWE: There's motive.
One of his best friends

13:29.171 --> 13:32.174
was murdered in a drive-by
by a Crip two weeks ago.

13:32.208 --> 13:33.410
And there's an M. O.

13:33.443 --> 13:35.412
Steven Miller himself
is implicated

13:35.445 --> 13:37.680
in two previous
drive-by shootings

13:37.714 --> 13:38.881
for which he served time.

13:38.915 --> 13:40.883
FRUTT: Two years
as an accessory.

13:40.917 --> 13:43.052
LOWE: And there's opportunity.

13:43.085 --> 13:45.855
Steven Miller's car was seen
speeding from the scene

13:45.888 --> 13:48.391
immediately after shouts
were heard.

13:48.425 --> 13:49.826
That's it?

13:49.859 --> 13:53.430
LOWE: That's certainly enough
to get an arrest warrant.

13:53.463 --> 13:54.431
I don't like it.

13:57.734 --> 13:59.902
I'll let the charges
stand for now,

13:59.936 --> 14:01.471
but if you don't get
anything more--

14:01.504 --> 14:03.540
Your Honor--
WHITE: You can bring your motion

14:03.573 --> 14:05.342
to dismiss down
the road, Ms. Frutt.

14:05.375 --> 14:06.809
I'll be willing to hear you.

14:06.843 --> 14:10.847
But for now,
he stays in custody, no bail.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.383
As for the drug charges
against Terrance Miller--

14:13.416 --> 14:14.216
WHITE: There again,

14:14.250 --> 14:15.752
you can file a motion
to suppress

14:15.785 --> 14:16.886
for Juvenile Court.

14:16.919 --> 14:19.288
I'm sure they'll hear you
on fourth amendment grounds.

14:19.322 --> 14:22.492
But for now,
those charges also stand.

14:22.525 --> 14:25.261
Terrance is released
on personal recognizance.

14:25.294 --> 14:27.930
We'll conference to set up
trial dates. Adjourned.

14:33.536 --> 14:35.405
What happens now?

14:35.438 --> 14:37.740
I don't know.

14:37.774 --> 14:39.676
Go someplace and talk?

14:47.650 --> 14:50.219
Ms. Dole,
I don't even know him.

14:50.252 --> 14:51.153
He's your father.

14:51.187 --> 14:52.755
Yeah, I understand,

14:52.789 --> 14:54.757
but he went to prison
when I was three.

14:54.791 --> 14:57.159
And since I thought
he killed my mother,

14:57.193 --> 14:59.295
I've spent my entire
lifetime hating him.

14:59.329 --> 15:00.930
But he didn't kill her.

15:00.963 --> 15:03.766
Yes, I realize this.

15:05.668 --> 15:07.670
He can't take care
of himself, you know. he's...

15:07.704 --> 15:09.372
Retarded?

15:09.406 --> 15:12.074
Yes.

15:12.108 --> 15:14.243
Are you suggesting
I take care of him?

15:14.276 --> 15:16.813
You're his only family.

15:16.846 --> 15:19.782
What makes you think I can?

15:19.816 --> 15:20.783
I don't know.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.121
What's he like?

15:25.154 --> 15:27.324
He's very sweet.

15:31.027 --> 15:32.895
That's all I can do.

15:32.929 --> 15:34.564
Would you like
to meet him?

15:34.597 --> 15:37.700
Um, oh, no, he'd be--

15:37.734 --> 15:39.602
No. Thank you.

15:42.639 --> 15:45.775
If he testifies
against the older brother,

15:45.808 --> 15:47.176
we drop the drug charges.

15:47.209 --> 15:48.578
How very big of you.

15:48.611 --> 15:50.179
LOWE: And all
the accessory charges

15:50.212 --> 15:51.348
for the murder itself.

15:51.381 --> 15:52.949
Alan, you don't have a case
against Steven Miller,

15:53.416 --> 15:54.283
and you know it.

15:54.317 --> 15:55.885
LOWE: Ellenor,
you have a conflict here.

15:55.918 --> 15:58.755
I've advised my clients
of the conflict, thank you.

15:58.788 --> 16:02.559
Mr. Miller, you live within
two blocks of the school.

16:02.592 --> 16:04.661
That means the drugs we found
in Terrance's room,

16:04.694 --> 16:07.464
that's possession with intent
in a school zone.

16:07.497 --> 16:08.665
Mandatory two years.

16:08.698 --> 16:09.999
For half an ounce of pot.

16:10.032 --> 16:12.134
LOWE: He will lose
his right start scholarship,

16:12.168 --> 16:13.336
guaranteed.

16:13.370 --> 16:16.939
Your son has a future.
Is it worth sacrificing--

16:16.973 --> 16:18.240
I'm shutting this down.

16:18.274 --> 16:22.144
We got a bad kid here,
and we got a good kid.

16:22.178 --> 16:24.714
You are letting the bad kid
take the good kid down.

16:24.747 --> 16:26.416
FRUTT: Neither of them
are going down.

16:26.449 --> 16:27.550
Your search was bogus,

16:27.584 --> 16:29.419
and I will have this arrest
tossed within the week.

16:29.452 --> 16:33.523
I don't think you will.

16:33.556 --> 16:34.724
Let's go, Lester.

16:56.012 --> 16:59.849
Did you find her?

16:59.882 --> 17:02.652
Um,

17:02.685 --> 17:04.521
No, I didn't, Frank.

17:04.554 --> 17:07.990
I'm not sure I will.

17:08.023 --> 17:09.791
VAUGHAN: Well,
maybe you could--

17:09.826 --> 17:13.128
could put an ad
in the paper.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.365
Let me think
about that, okay?

17:23.506 --> 17:24.941
I found her.

17:24.973 --> 17:26.208
She doesn't want him
in her life.

17:26.242 --> 17:28.711
What are you going to do?
He can't stay here.

17:28.745 --> 17:30.847
He stayed in a shelter
last night, and he got bullied.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.950
Lindsay,
he can't stay here.

17:33.983 --> 17:36.819
I'm going to talk to Helen.
Why?

17:36.853 --> 17:38.921
I don't know. Maybe there's
some kind of restitution program

17:38.955 --> 17:39.989
we're unaware of...

17:40.022 --> 17:41.290
I can give you
the answer to that.

17:41.324 --> 17:43.526
You don't need to go
to Helen.

17:43.560 --> 17:46.162
I'm going to go
to Helen.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.698
HELEN: I don't know
what to tell you.

17:48.731 --> 17:51.301
LOWE: If this were a rich
white kid who had been shot,

17:51.334 --> 17:53.403
we would have
triple the resources.

17:53.436 --> 17:55.004
Because this is
gang violence

17:55.037 --> 17:56.539
and we got a poor
black victim--

17:56.573 --> 17:58.541
Well, I'm not sure
that's the case, Alan,

17:58.575 --> 17:59.509
but I'll tell you this.

17:59.542 --> 18:02.111
If Steven Miller
took out a 14-year-old Crip,

18:02.144 --> 18:04.581
he should be thanking you
for the arrest.

18:04.614 --> 18:06.549
Because out on the street...

18:09.686 --> 18:11.521
Helen, you got a second?

18:11.554 --> 18:13.155
Do I, Alan?

18:15.425 --> 18:17.126
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

18:20.330 --> 18:22.432
You know anything
about the Frank Vaughan case?

18:22.465 --> 18:24.934
Just cleared through DNA.
What about it?

18:24.967 --> 18:26.536
Would you know why
he wasn't released

18:26.569 --> 18:28.638
into a managed care
facility?

18:28.671 --> 18:30.407
Uh, well, from what
I understand,

18:30.440 --> 18:32.809
he was never officially
labeled mentally retarded.

18:32.842 --> 18:36.045
Without that, the D. O. C.
has no obligation.

18:36.078 --> 18:38.448
What about the fact that
he was wrongfully incarcerated

18:38.481 --> 18:39.749
for 15 years?

18:39.782 --> 18:41.818
I would think that would
trigger some legal obligation.

18:41.851 --> 18:44.153
I'd think it, too,
but in Massachusetts,

18:44.186 --> 18:45.688
that's not the case.

18:45.722 --> 18:47.657
Are you telling me

18:47.690 --> 18:50.660
your office feels
no responsibility here?

18:50.693 --> 18:53.162
Lindsay, what I know
is it's the D. A.'s office

18:53.195 --> 18:56.433
that requested the DNA test
on this one.

18:56.466 --> 18:59.336
So let's not accuse us
of not caring, okay?

19:01.103 --> 19:04.374
LOWE: Any murder, of course,
is a tragedy.

19:04.407 --> 19:07.043
We hope to solve them all.

19:07.076 --> 19:09.412
But this one--

19:09.446 --> 19:12.582
a 14-year-old boy with
a bright future ahead of him

19:12.615 --> 19:16.653
was killed because
he was wearing a blue jacket.

19:16.686 --> 19:17.954
It appears that the suspect,

19:17.987 --> 19:19.922
a member of the gang
known as the Bloods,

19:19.956 --> 19:23.793
thought that Brian Fletcher
was a Crip.

19:23.826 --> 19:27.897
If anybody has any information
regarding this crime

19:27.930 --> 19:30.333
or the suspect Steven Miller,

19:30.367 --> 19:32.802
we ask that you come forward,

19:32.835 --> 19:34.571
because right now
we're dismissing this case

19:34.604 --> 19:36.773
due to a lack of evidence.
What?

19:36.806 --> 19:40.743
LOWE: At this time, he's deemed
innocent and faces no charges,

19:40.777 --> 19:43.380
but do not approach
this man.

19:43.413 --> 19:45.448
he is considered
to be possibly armed

19:45.482 --> 19:46.983
and dangerous.

19:47.016 --> 19:50.052
Simply notify the authorities
if you have any information.

19:50.086 --> 19:51.253
Thank you.

19:51.287 --> 19:52.522
REPORTER: Mr. Lowe,
can we please...

19:52.555 --> 19:54.090
REPORTER (over TV):
In other local news--

19:54.123 --> 19:56.493
Did he just do
what I think he did?

19:56.526 --> 19:59.529
We've pulled some tactics,
but that there was nasty.

20:02.599 --> 20:05.001
How'd you make out?

20:05.034 --> 20:06.369
It didn't.

20:06.403 --> 20:08.438
There's no automatic
restitution required

20:08.471 --> 20:09.339
in the Commonwealth,

20:09.372 --> 20:10.773
at least not without
a hard-to-win lawsuit.

20:10.807 --> 20:12.509
How about appealing
to her conscience?

20:12.542 --> 20:13.776
Helen's?

20:13.810 --> 20:15.478
Talk about
your small targets.

20:15.512 --> 20:17.947
DOLE: Evidently, the district
attorney's office is feeling

20:17.980 --> 20:21.418
quite good about itself since
they requested the DNA test.

20:21.451 --> 20:23.786
I wasn't in much of a position
to guilt them.

20:23.820 --> 20:25.855
What do you mean
they requested the DNA test?

20:25.888 --> 20:27.223
That's what Helen told me.

20:27.256 --> 20:29.926
YOUNG: Well, why would
the D. A.'s office ever do that

20:29.959 --> 20:33.162
on their own accord?

20:33.195 --> 20:35.398
Did you ask Helen that?

20:35.432 --> 20:37.767
No.

20:37.800 --> 20:38.801
I would.

20:42.905 --> 20:45.542
Lindsay, look. I found
another picture of her

20:45.575 --> 20:46.909
in my wallet.

20:46.943 --> 20:50.112
It was in a secret place.
I forgot.

20:50.146 --> 20:51.981
DOLE: Frank, Andrea doesn't look
like this anymore.

20:52.014 --> 20:53.716
She's all grown up now.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.952
I-I know,
but won't this help?

20:55.985 --> 20:59.055
I bet she still smiles
like that.

21:06.963 --> 21:08.164
I was told
you never knock.

21:08.197 --> 21:09.766
You just ordered
his execution.

21:09.799 --> 21:12.435
I did no such thing. I put out
a call for information.

21:12.469 --> 21:15.237
You put his face on the screen
and made an announcement

21:15.271 --> 21:16.873
that he was a Blood
who murdered a Crip,

21:16.906 --> 21:18.608
and then you freed him
from custody.

21:18.641 --> 21:20.510
I had no case,
just like you said.

21:20.543 --> 21:22.044
FRUTT: You set him up
to be killed.

21:22.078 --> 21:24.647
You issued a death sentence,
and it's vile!

21:24.681 --> 21:26.583
LOWE: Tantamount to
a death sentence, perhaps,

21:26.616 --> 21:29.151
but again,
not my intent.

21:29.185 --> 21:31.421
I'll grant you,
looking at the circumstances

21:31.454 --> 21:32.389
the way they are now,

21:32.422 --> 21:34.757
your client is safer in jail
than he is out.

21:34.791 --> 21:37.327
So let's make a deal,
and I'll do my best

21:37.360 --> 21:39.729
to swiftly get him
into protective custody.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.867
I am going to go to the judge

21:44.901 --> 21:47.337
and report this little act
of extortion.

21:47.370 --> 21:49.639
And if anything happens
to Steven Miller,

21:49.672 --> 21:52.609
I will personally see to it
that murder accessory charges

21:52.642 --> 21:53.843
are brought against you.

21:53.876 --> 21:57.447
Fine.
Go to the judge.

21:57.480 --> 21:58.748
And on your way home,

21:58.781 --> 22:00.350
perhaps you can
swing by the morgue

22:00.383 --> 22:02.251
and take a look
at Brian Fletcher.

22:20.036 --> 22:21.404
Bingo.

22:21.438 --> 22:23.506
The D. A.'s office
ordered investigations

22:23.540 --> 22:26.509
and some DNA tests
in 43 different cases

22:26.543 --> 22:27.744
involving
a bad police officer.

22:28.177 --> 22:29.111
What?

22:29.145 --> 22:31.981
In Frank's case,
the cop lied on the stand,

22:32.014 --> 22:34.317
and he allegedly
corrupted an eyewitness

22:34.351 --> 22:35.518
whose husband
was in jail.

22:35.552 --> 22:36.386
Whose husband?

22:36.419 --> 22:37.754
HATCHER: A prosecution witness.

22:37.787 --> 22:39.889
I mean, basically,
this rogue cop

22:39.922 --> 22:41.824
coerced witnesses
into lying.

22:41.858 --> 22:44.427
All his cases
are under review.

22:44.461 --> 22:46.529
Bobby, I'd like to bring
a civil rights action

22:46.563 --> 22:47.930
against the state.
Lindsay--

22:47.964 --> 22:49.666
Have you seen
those homeless shelters?

22:49.699 --> 22:51.401
Frank deserves
to get some money.

22:51.434 --> 22:53.269
False imprisonment
for 15 years?

22:53.303 --> 22:55.204
DONNELL: It'll take years
in discovery.

22:55.237 --> 22:56.439
Even if you survive
a summary judgment--

22:56.473 --> 22:58.975
I have to be able
to get something.

22:59.008 --> 23:00.543
Rebecca, could you start
filing the complaint for me?

23:00.577 --> 23:01.511
Sure.

23:01.544 --> 23:03.012
Look, Lindsay--

23:03.045 --> 23:04.447
Let me spend
one day on it.

23:04.481 --> 23:05.815
one day.

23:08.250 --> 23:11.421
He's trying to coerce my client
with the threat of death.

23:12.489 --> 23:14.023
Mr. Lowe?

23:14.056 --> 23:16.125
Ms. Frutt's client
is a gang member.

23:16.158 --> 23:17.627
Ex-gang member.
LOWE: His car was seen

23:17.660 --> 23:18.728
speeding from the scene.

23:18.761 --> 23:20.497
I was putting out
a call for information,

23:20.530 --> 23:21.898
which I am entitled to do.

23:21.931 --> 23:23.766
You declared him a killer
on television.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.668
I called him the suspect.

23:25.702 --> 23:28.037
MAN: Mr. Lowe, you're beginning
to get a reputation.

23:28.070 --> 23:30.340
Great.
Maybe the defense lawyers

23:30.373 --> 23:31.741
will be more inclined
to plea bargain.

23:31.774 --> 23:33.142
No, it's not great.

23:33.175 --> 23:35.244
Your reputation
is anything but great.

23:37.213 --> 23:39.281
But, Ms. Frutt,

23:39.316 --> 23:42.118
technically, he hasn't stepped
outside of the boundaries here.

23:43.686 --> 23:44.521
I would like the Court

23:44.554 --> 23:46.389
to put my client
into protective custody.

23:46.423 --> 23:48.625
That's a D. A.'s call,
and I'm not asking for that.

23:48.658 --> 23:51.160
To remove the coercion,
I need my client safe.

23:51.193 --> 23:53.195
Your Honor, if we're going
to put every suspect

23:53.229 --> 23:54.997
into protective custody--
How about just the ones

23:55.031 --> 23:56.733
who have televised bounties
on their head?

23:56.766 --> 23:59.336
I'm not putting him in
protective custody, counselor.

23:59.369 --> 24:01.504
Why not?
JUDGE: Because you haven't shown

24:01.538 --> 24:02.639
me any tangible threat.

24:02.672 --> 24:04.307
When you get one,
let me know.

24:04.341 --> 24:05.708
We're talking about gangs.

24:05.742 --> 24:08.845
The first warning
is often a bullet to the head.

24:10.046 --> 24:12.382
If you get a threat,
bring it to me.

24:12.415 --> 24:15.352
Until then,
I can't do anything.

24:16.986 --> 24:18.588
ANDREA: Why do you need me?

24:18.621 --> 24:20.122
I don't, technically,

24:20.156 --> 24:22.291
but, well, you know,
you might have a claim, too,

24:22.325 --> 24:24.427
Andrea.

24:24.461 --> 24:26.763
You lost your father.
They took him from you.

24:26.796 --> 24:30.300
He's not my dad.
He's my biological father.

24:30.333 --> 24:32.302
And how does it help him
if I sue?

24:32.335 --> 24:33.936
You don't have to sue,

24:33.970 --> 24:37.407
but if I had you on board
as a witness...

24:37.440 --> 24:38.908
A witness to what?

24:38.941 --> 24:40.877
To what he lost.

24:46.616 --> 24:50.353
You're all he's thought about
for 15 years.

24:50.387 --> 24:52.589
I don't need this.
I'm sorry.

24:52.622 --> 24:54.891
I'm here because
of what he needs.

24:54.924 --> 24:57.026
I'm going to have to
ask you to leave now.

24:57.059 --> 25:00.129
I don't understand why
you don't want to meet him.

25:00.162 --> 25:02.264
Oh.

25:02.299 --> 25:04.734
You don't understand that.

25:04.767 --> 25:06.869
I guess that means
you can otherwise

25:06.903 --> 25:08.638
understand my life,
Ms. Dole.

25:10.807 --> 25:13.075
My very first memory

25:13.109 --> 25:15.412
was finding my mother dead.

25:15.445 --> 25:17.880
I thought
she was just play-acting.

25:17.914 --> 25:20.550
I was crawling on her,
laughing,

25:20.583 --> 25:24.086
like it was all a game,
until...

25:24.120 --> 25:27.824
I've lived in seven different
foster homes.

25:32.395 --> 25:36.065
I'm sorry
you don't understand things,

25:37.066 --> 25:40.470
but let me see if I can
get you to understand this--

25:41.538 --> 25:44.941
My life,
for the first time,

25:44.974 --> 25:47.544
is moving forward.

25:47.577 --> 25:49.379
It's even normal.

25:49.412 --> 25:53.115
I've got a job,
a boyfriend, I--

25:56.819 --> 25:59.589
You're in here

25:59.622 --> 26:03.626
asking me to go backwards
to a place...

26:04.761 --> 26:07.664
I can't do it,

26:09.566 --> 26:11.734
and it's not...

26:11.768 --> 26:14.571
that I don't want
a father.

26:16.373 --> 26:18.641
I've wanted nothing more.

26:22.879 --> 26:26.115
But I can't do it.

26:26.148 --> 26:28.117
I can't.

26:34.857 --> 26:36.993
I don't know
what else to tell you.

26:37.026 --> 26:38.928
It isn't good.

26:38.961 --> 26:42.198
They're not even looking
for anybody else.

26:42.399 --> 26:46.135
I've never put the question
to you before, Lester,

26:46.168 --> 26:48.004
did Steven do this?

26:50.307 --> 26:52.174
Obviously,
you think he did.

26:52.208 --> 26:54.411
His best friend
was killed,

26:54.444 --> 26:55.978
he's seen speeding
from the scene,

26:56.012 --> 26:58.648
he's been involved
in two drive-bys before.

26:58.681 --> 26:59.682
I would be lying to you

26:59.716 --> 27:03.085
if I told you
I didn't have some doubts.

27:03.119 --> 27:05.221
Given everything
we're up against,

27:05.254 --> 27:08.991
this may be the time
to consider a deal.

27:10.159 --> 27:12.329
Add to the mix
the D. A. setting him up,

27:12.362 --> 27:15.598
Steven is probably safer
in jail.

27:15.632 --> 27:18.668
I can get the drug charges
dropped on Terrance.

27:19.769 --> 27:23.139
I hate to let the D. A. win
on this,

27:23.172 --> 27:26.576
but there are other things
I am more afraid of.

27:28.010 --> 27:30.313
You're asking me

27:30.347 --> 27:33.683
to advise my son
to plead guilty

27:33.716 --> 27:35.752
to a murder
he didn't commit.

27:39.088 --> 27:40.990
I-I have to go to Court?

27:41.023 --> 27:42.291
It's possible, but--

27:42.325 --> 27:43.926
But I didn't do anything.
Frank--

27:43.960 --> 27:45.628
I didn't do anything.
Okay.

27:45.662 --> 27:46.796
Don't make me go to Court.

27:46.829 --> 27:49.065
Frank, Frank, listen.

27:49.098 --> 27:51.200
You don't have to
go to jail.

27:51.233 --> 27:53.269
This isn't about that.

27:53.303 --> 27:55.972
This is about getting
the state to pay you money

27:56.005 --> 27:58.441
for putting you
in prison before.

27:58.475 --> 28:01.077
But I didn't do
anything before.

28:01.110 --> 28:02.712
I know that.
All right, please

28:02.745 --> 28:03.813
don't make me go to Court.

28:03.846 --> 28:05.715
Please don't make me.
Please.

28:05.748 --> 28:08.318
Okay, we won't.

28:13.456 --> 28:15.858
They think I killed her,
you know?

28:15.892 --> 28:18.395
No, no, they don't
think that anymore.

28:18.428 --> 28:22.399
Everybody knows
you didn't do anything wrong.

28:22.432 --> 28:23.566
Does Andrea know?

28:27.737 --> 28:30.773
We need to find her
to tell her.

28:37.480 --> 28:40.650
I did find her, Frank.

28:40.683 --> 28:42.452
You did?

28:42.485 --> 28:44.554
She wishes you well,

28:44.587 --> 28:47.256
and, um...

28:47.289 --> 28:50.360
she told me to tell you
she loves you.

28:50.393 --> 28:54.296
Is she coming over?

28:54.331 --> 28:56.533
No.

28:56.566 --> 28:59.402
Her life has been
very difficult.

28:59.436 --> 29:00.603
It's going well now,

29:00.637 --> 29:02.839
but she thinks it's best

29:02.872 --> 29:05.041
if she doesn't see you just yet.

29:06.443 --> 29:07.777
W--

29:07.810 --> 29:10.179
Why?

29:10.212 --> 29:11.781
Well...

29:11.814 --> 29:13.249
it's complicated.

29:13.282 --> 29:15.652
She still thinks I did
what they say I did.

29:15.685 --> 29:18.488
No, no. she doesn't think
you did anything wrong.

29:18.521 --> 29:21.624
Then why doesn't she want
to come over?

29:21.658 --> 29:25.428
Well, maybe in time,
she will,

29:25.462 --> 29:27.597
but for now...

29:27.630 --> 29:29.366
WASHINGTON: Hey.

29:29.399 --> 29:32.234
Let's look
at what is good here.

29:32.268 --> 29:33.970
Lindsay is going
to take this complaint

29:34.003 --> 29:35.872
to the attorney general's
office,

29:35.905 --> 29:37.807
and we're going
to file our claim,

29:37.840 --> 29:39.776
and hopefully
we're going to get you money

29:39.809 --> 29:41.878
so you can get
a place to live.

29:41.911 --> 29:44.481
You won't have to sleep
at the shelter.

29:44.514 --> 29:45.982
Isn't that great?

29:49.519 --> 29:52.755
One day
she will come over?

30:00.963 --> 30:02.365
I don't need
a lecture, Helen.

30:02.399 --> 30:03.433
I think you do.

30:03.466 --> 30:04.867
Least of all from you.

30:04.901 --> 30:06.068
GAMBLE: The way
you are behaving,

30:06.102 --> 30:07.970
your opinion doesn't
much matter to me.

30:08.004 --> 30:10.440
Well, nor yours
to me, so...

30:10.473 --> 30:12.609
GAMBLE: So fine,
but considering mine reflects

30:12.642 --> 30:13.710
an office consensus,

30:13.743 --> 30:17.113
you might want to listen
for the fun of it.

30:17.146 --> 30:18.515
Look,

30:18.548 --> 30:20.249
you've gone too far.

30:20.282 --> 30:22.419
Busting the younger brother
for leverage,

30:22.452 --> 30:23.853
calling a press conference

30:23.886 --> 30:26.022
for the purpose
of creating a death threat.

30:26.055 --> 30:28.758
I made a promise
to Brian Fletcher's mother

30:28.791 --> 30:31.227
that I would--
This isn't keeping promises.

30:31.260 --> 30:32.261
You've never played
hardball before. Is that--

30:32.294 --> 30:33.596
GAMBLE: Nor is this hardball.

30:33.630 --> 30:36.165
It goes beyond that.

30:37.700 --> 30:41.604
Alan, you came to me
asking for advice.

30:41.638 --> 30:43.306
Now I am giving it
to you.

30:45.942 --> 30:48.611
Your integrity
is at stake.

30:48.645 --> 30:52.181
The integrity of this office
is at stake.

30:57.454 --> 30:59.088
Mr. Lowe?

30:59.121 --> 31:00.657
I'm Lance Miller--

31:00.690 --> 31:04.193
Steven's brother.

31:04.226 --> 31:06.829
What can I do for you?

31:06.863 --> 31:08.531
I did it.

31:08.565 --> 31:09.832
I shot that kid.

31:20.310 --> 31:22.812
LANCE: I have a friend.
His name's Billy.

31:22.845 --> 31:25.915
I was going to see him.
That's why I was there.

31:25.948 --> 31:27.517
You went to see
your friend Billy.

31:27.550 --> 31:29.118
Yes.

31:29.151 --> 31:31.120
Two miles from your house.
You walked.

31:31.153 --> 31:31.854
Yes.

31:31.888 --> 31:33.690
With a gun.

31:33.723 --> 31:35.658
I was going
to show Billy the gun.

31:35.692 --> 31:37.427
Where'd you get the gun?

31:37.460 --> 31:38.495
LANCE: I found it.

31:38.528 --> 31:39.629
Where?

31:39.662 --> 31:41.964
In a ditch
behind the projects.

31:41.998 --> 31:44.367
So I was going
to show Billy,

31:44.401 --> 31:47.304
then that kid--
he started punking me.

31:47.337 --> 31:49.506
The Fletcher boy?
LANCE: Yeah.

31:49.539 --> 31:52.509
He was going
to beat me up and stuff,

31:52.542 --> 31:55.277
and I got scared,

31:55.312 --> 31:57.880
so I shot him.

31:57.914 --> 32:00.817
GAMBLE: What kind of gun
was it, Lance?

32:00.850 --> 32:01.918
A handgun.

32:05.322 --> 32:06.689
What's going on?

32:06.723 --> 32:09.959
Ellenor,
you know Lance Miller?

32:09.992 --> 32:12.595
FRUTT: Of course I know him.
what are you doing here, Lance?

32:12.629 --> 32:15.932
LOWE: He just confessed
to killing Brian Fletcher.

32:15.965 --> 32:17.400
Excuse me?

32:17.434 --> 32:21.137
That's why we called you.

32:21.170 --> 32:22.271
Give me just a second.

32:22.305 --> 32:23.806
Lance,
will you come with me?

32:31.247 --> 32:32.281
(door closes)

32:32.315 --> 32:36.018
LOWE: Now, if Steven
isn't the shooter,

32:36.052 --> 32:38.287
why would his kid brother
be down here

32:38.321 --> 32:39.622
trying to save him?

32:42.959 --> 32:44.861
I'm not defending
the policeman.

32:44.894 --> 32:46.896
I'm just saying
we don't know for sure

32:46.929 --> 32:48.331
he lied
in Frank Vaughan's case.

32:48.365 --> 32:51.934
He's known to lie.
DNA cleared Frank Vaughan.

32:51.968 --> 32:54.103
The likelihood is
this cop is responsible.

32:54.136 --> 32:56.773
Obviously, I'm not about
to comment on the merits.

32:56.806 --> 32:58.808
You haven't even filed
your complaint yet.

32:58.841 --> 33:02.044
My client isn't looking to win
a lottery here, Mr. Jenkins.

33:02.078 --> 33:03.446
All I'm asking for

33:03.480 --> 33:06.215
is to make sure
he's taken care of.

33:06.248 --> 33:08.017
I want to establish
a trust,

33:08.050 --> 33:10.186
I want temporary housing
in a private group home.

33:10.219 --> 33:11.688
I don't have authority
to do that.

33:11.721 --> 33:15.224
You have the authority
to make the recommendation.

33:15.257 --> 33:16.759
Look,

33:16.793 --> 33:20.129
the liability on this
isn't in question here.

33:20.162 --> 33:22.031
We both know it.

33:22.064 --> 33:23.800
Frank Vaughan
is mentally handicapped.

33:23.833 --> 33:25.802
I'm just asking
that we not drag this out.

33:25.835 --> 33:28.438
I'm giving you the chance
to settle this quickly

33:28.471 --> 33:29.706
and cheaply.

33:29.739 --> 33:33.175
I know you don't want this
in the hands of a jury.

33:33.209 --> 33:35.845
Let's just do something here

33:35.878 --> 33:38.247
because it's
the right thing to do.

33:43.320 --> 33:45.087
All right.

33:47.023 --> 33:48.525
He didn't shoot
the Fletcher boy.

33:48.558 --> 33:51.761
He decided
to confess to it since--

33:51.794 --> 33:54.331
Look, he figured
since he was 10,

33:54.364 --> 33:55.998
the punishment
would be less for him

33:56.032 --> 33:57.367
than Steven.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.935
Well, that's very astute,
Ellenor.

33:58.968 --> 34:00.269
Whose idea was it?

34:00.303 --> 34:02.772
FRUTT: He says it was his,
and I believe him, Helen.

34:02.805 --> 34:04.607
Lester would have never
sent down his 10-year-old

34:04.641 --> 34:05.475
to fall on a grenade.

34:05.508 --> 34:06.208
Well, then,
why would he--

34:06.242 --> 34:07.677
FRUTT: He was just convinced

34:07.710 --> 34:09.277
that Steven was going
to get arrested for it.

34:09.312 --> 34:11.648
He's scared, Helen.
That's all.

34:11.681 --> 34:13.049
His father's home crying,

34:13.081 --> 34:16.753
He's got two brother--
He just got scared.

34:16.786 --> 34:18.219
Where is he now?

34:18.254 --> 34:19.989
He's right outside.

34:20.022 --> 34:21.358
Could you bring him in,
please?

34:26.094 --> 34:28.030
FRUTT: Lance?

34:35.103 --> 34:37.407
Michael, place the boy
under arrest for murder, please,

34:37.440 --> 34:38.641
and transport him
to Juvenile Court.

34:38.675 --> 34:40.042
What?
LOWE: Read him his rights.

34:40.076 --> 34:42.445
FRUTT: For God's sake,
you know he made it all up.

34:42.478 --> 34:44.481
LOWE: You tell Mr. Miller
that if he has

34:44.514 --> 34:46.783
any information
on this crime,

34:46.815 --> 34:48.318
he should come forward.

34:48.351 --> 34:50.453
Otherwise, his 10-year-old
will be indicted

34:50.487 --> 34:51.621
as a youthful offender.

34:51.654 --> 34:53.322
FRUTT: First of all,
any confession you got--

34:53.356 --> 34:54.690
He's 10 years old.
without counsel present--

34:54.724 --> 34:56.225
LOWE: That confession
is not custodial.

34:56.257 --> 34:58.127
He just walked in
and announced that he did it.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.862
State of mind.
LOWE: You can try to suppress it

34:59.896 --> 35:01.063
if you want, Ellenor,

35:01.097 --> 35:02.098
but he will
be indicted.

35:02.131 --> 35:04.367
Read him his rights,
detective.

35:04.401 --> 35:05.335
Detective.

35:08.971 --> 35:10.039
MCGUIRE: Lance Miller,
you're under arrest

35:10.072 --> 35:12.108
for the murder
of Brian Fletcher.

35:12.141 --> 35:14.010
You have the right
to remain silent.

35:14.043 --> 35:15.678
Anything you say
can and will be used

35:15.712 --> 35:17.780
against you in a Court of law.

35:17.814 --> 35:19.281
You have the right
to an attorney.

35:19.316 --> 35:22.685
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

35:27.890 --> 35:29.859
There's a lot of details
to still work out.

35:29.892 --> 35:31.461
We haven't agreed
on how much money,

35:31.494 --> 35:32.194
but in the meantime,

35:32.228 --> 35:35.031
we have a place
for you to live,

35:35.064 --> 35:36.566
and soon
you'll be able to move

35:36.599 --> 35:37.867
to an even better place,

35:37.900 --> 35:41.304
and you'll have enough money
for rent, groceries...

35:41.338 --> 35:43.373
We can move you into
your temporary housing today.

35:43.406 --> 35:45.975
And--and Andrea.
Can she come?

35:47.610 --> 35:48.478
Frank...

35:48.511 --> 35:50.780
I told you.

35:50.813 --> 35:52.949
Andrea's not coming.

35:53.215 --> 35:55.385
We explained this,
remember?

35:55.418 --> 35:56.886
You lied to me.

35:56.919 --> 35:57.954
I didn't lie.

35:57.987 --> 36:00.357
You said you did not find her
when you did.

36:00.390 --> 36:01.257
Well--

36:01.290 --> 36:03.125
And now I don't believe you

36:03.159 --> 36:04.661
when you say she won't come.

36:04.694 --> 36:05.628
Why would I say that--

36:05.662 --> 36:07.530
You lied.
The police lied before,

36:07.564 --> 36:09.265
and you're lying now.

36:09.298 --> 36:11.401
Nobody wants me
to be with her

36:11.434 --> 36:13.135
because I am retarded.

36:13.169 --> 36:15.438
You--you think
that I am bad for her

36:15.472 --> 36:17.106
because I'm retarded.

36:17.139 --> 36:19.642
You think that I will--
I will hurt her.

36:19.676 --> 36:20.677
That is not the case.

36:20.710 --> 36:21.844
Where is she, then?

36:21.878 --> 36:23.112
Tell me where she is.

36:23.145 --> 36:24.514
I can't really do that.

36:24.547 --> 36:27.049
But why?
I promised her I wouldn't.

36:33.456 --> 36:35.325
This is...

36:35.358 --> 36:37.560
just too painful
for her, Frank.

36:37.594 --> 36:40.830
She needs time to adjust.

36:42.064 --> 36:44.867
The only thing
that I ever did

36:44.901 --> 36:48.170
was make a baby...

36:48.204 --> 36:51.207
A beautiful,
beautiful baby.

36:53.009 --> 36:55.211
Why can't I be with her?

36:57.480 --> 36:59.649
Maybe in time.

37:03.219 --> 37:05.655
Let's get you
to your new home, okay?

37:05.688 --> 37:09.459
I really think
you're going to like it.

37:09.492 --> 37:10.927
Okay.

37:12.695 --> 37:14.731
FRUTT: Don't tell me
this isn't your case, Helen.

37:14.764 --> 37:16.566
You've seen enough firsthand
to step in.

37:16.599 --> 37:18.401
I can't just step in.
Even if--

37:18.435 --> 37:20.770
He's using this
to turn the screw,

37:20.803 --> 37:22.405
and as an officer
of the Court,

37:22.439 --> 37:24.941
You have an obligation
to report him.

37:24.974 --> 37:26.075
For what?

37:26.108 --> 37:27.410
Bad faith.

37:27.444 --> 37:30.112
Even Richard Bay wouldn't
have pulled this kind of crap.

37:30.146 --> 37:32.415
You have to step in.

37:32.449 --> 37:34.751
(cell phone rings)

37:34.784 --> 37:36.185
(sighs)

37:36.218 --> 37:39.021
Ellenor Frutt.

37:39.055 --> 37:40.990
What?

37:42.659 --> 37:44.594
When?

37:46.596 --> 37:48.731
Steven Miller
was just stabbed.

37:48.765 --> 37:50.600
He's in surgery
at Brigham's.

37:56.072 --> 37:58.274
WOMAN (over PA):
Dr. Evans to ICU.

37:58.308 --> 38:00.710
Dr. Evans to ICU.

38:04.914 --> 38:07.817
On-call cardiologist, 3148.

38:07.850 --> 38:11.688
On-call cardiologist,
3148 stat.

38:18.561 --> 38:21.163
They think
he's going to be okay.

38:25.502 --> 38:27.604
Was it a retaliation hit?

38:27.637 --> 38:29.539
No.

38:29.572 --> 38:31.541
It was one of the Bloods--

38:31.574 --> 38:33.242
the gang he used to be in.

38:33.275 --> 38:34.611
I don't understand.

38:34.644 --> 38:37.146
LESTER: His name
is Lennard Stewart.

38:37.179 --> 38:39.716
He's also the one
who shot the Fletcher boy,

38:39.749 --> 38:41.217
Mr. Lowe.

38:41.250 --> 38:44.421
He evidently thought that Steven
would eventually find out

38:44.454 --> 38:45.788
that it was him,

38:45.822 --> 38:48.925
and that Steven would
turn him in to save himself,

38:48.958 --> 38:51.227
so he decided...

38:52.929 --> 38:56.466
He tried to shut Steven up
for good.

39:04.874 --> 39:06.275
Come on, come on.

39:06.309 --> 39:07.844
The doctor says
you can come in now. Come on.

39:07.877 --> 39:09.412
Come on.

39:16.185 --> 39:18.888
Feeling pretty good, Alan?

39:18.921 --> 39:21.858
Are you?

39:21.891 --> 39:25.227
I take my cues
from defense attorneys, Ellenor.

39:25.261 --> 39:27.730
They come to me
saying one of two things--

39:27.764 --> 39:29.766
"My client's innocent"

39:29.799 --> 39:32.369
or "You got no case."

39:32.402 --> 39:35.004
You were telling me
that I had no case.

39:42.379 --> 39:44.414
Your bathroom
is nicer than mine.

39:44.447 --> 39:47.283
(chuckles)

39:47.317 --> 39:49.251
It's really all mine?

39:49.285 --> 39:50.420
You don't own
the apartment,

39:50.453 --> 39:51.788
but it's all yours
to use.

39:51.821 --> 39:53.756
Eventually, you'll probably
move to another place

39:53.790 --> 39:55.925
which will also be yours,
but for now...

39:55.958 --> 39:57.894
Have you lived alone
before?

39:57.927 --> 40:00.597
Oh, yes.
Before the police took me,

40:00.630 --> 40:02.198
but, oh, this is--

40:02.231 --> 40:05.335
this is so much nicer
than--than--

40:10.340 --> 40:11.741
Hi, dad.

40:16.479 --> 40:17.347
(gasps)

40:22.018 --> 40:25.087
Andrea?

40:25.121 --> 40:27.457
How--

40:27.490 --> 40:29.258
How are you?

40:30.893 --> 40:32.395
I am good.

40:32.429 --> 40:33.696
How are you?

40:33.730 --> 40:36.499
I'm great.

40:36.533 --> 40:38.234
Oh.

40:38.267 --> 40:40.403
You--you--
you're so beautiful.

40:42.772 --> 40:43.573
Oh.

40:43.606 --> 40:46.443
She is so beautiful.

40:46.476 --> 40:48.411
ANDREA: Listen...

40:52.549 --> 40:54.917
All these years,

40:54.951 --> 40:57.019
I...

40:57.053 --> 40:59.288
They lied to you.

40:59.322 --> 41:00.256
Yeah.

41:04.327 --> 41:06.929
I--

41:06.963 --> 41:09.499
I've always wanted
to meet you.

41:09.532 --> 41:12.902
I have missed you

41:12.935 --> 41:14.937
so, so much.

41:23.045 --> 41:25.582
(sobbing)

41:30.920 --> 41:33.390
I do not want
to let go.

41:33.423 --> 41:34.724
Okay.

41:42.465 --> 41:43.466
Oh.

41:55.478 --> 41:57.647
Ms. Fletcher.

42:01.217 --> 42:05.154
They just arrested
the man who killed my son,

42:05.187 --> 42:08.558
not the man
you were after.

42:08.591 --> 42:12.329
But I know

42:12.362 --> 42:13.730
it never would have
come about

42:13.763 --> 42:15.565
if you had not pushed
the way you did.

42:17.900 --> 42:19.869
You kept your promise,

42:19.902 --> 42:22.339
Mr. Lowe.

42:24.106 --> 42:25.408
Thank you.

42:29.312 --> 42:32.449
You're a man of your word.

42:55.372 --> 42:59.108
(music playing)

43:21.764 --> 43:22.832
WOMAN: You stinker!
