WEBVTT

00:09.661 --> 00:11.750
All right!

00:11.794 --> 00:14.405
Oh, yeah, there she is.

00:14.449 --> 00:16.712
Look at you looking
just like me--

00:16.755 --> 00:19.280
strong, dark and smokin' hot.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.457
So what do you say, girl?

00:22.500 --> 00:26.069
You ready to bring a little
flavor to the neighborhood?

00:26.113 --> 00:28.637
Well, uh, I was just
going for a jog, but sure.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.858
I was talking
to my smoker, Dave.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.165
Getting ready
for the Yardecue this weekend.Oh, yeah.

00:35.209 --> 00:37.950
That's right. Your last Yardecue
was the day we moved in.

00:37.994 --> 00:40.475
Can you believe that we've
been neighbors for a year?

00:40.518 --> 00:44.044
I know. It feels like
so much longer, right?

00:45.828 --> 00:48.048
So, what can
I do to help?

00:50.267 --> 00:52.661
Uh, you can start
by wearing longer shorts.

00:54.663 --> 00:57.622
The only sausage I want to see
around here is on my grill.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.451
Look,

01:00.495 --> 01:03.367
besides, Dave,
I'm the big dog around here.

01:03.411 --> 01:05.369
It's my neighborhood,
my Yardecue.

01:05.413 --> 01:08.981
So...
Yeah, well, now that
I've been here a year,

01:09.025 --> 01:10.853
isn't it ourneighborhood?

01:10.896 --> 01:12.420
Couldn't it be ourYardecue?

01:12.463 --> 01:14.726
Or dare I say, Our-decue?

01:16.815 --> 01:18.774
That's... that's funny, man.

01:18.817 --> 01:20.341
No.

01:21.342 --> 01:22.734
Well, hold on.
Calvin, come on.

01:22.778 --> 01:25.128
I really want
to be a part of it.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.608
All right, fine.
What do you want to do?

01:26.651 --> 01:28.827
Well, you know,
I don't mean to brag,

01:28.871 --> 01:30.351
but back home in Kalamazoo,

01:30.394 --> 01:33.310
I was kind of known
for my barbecue.

01:33.354 --> 01:36.270
We called it "Kalama-Q."

01:37.140 --> 01:38.707
Yeah, you're on napkins.

01:38.750 --> 01:42.624
Come on. An-Any chump could
bring a bag of napkins.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.060
You said it, I didn't.

01:44.104 --> 01:47.977
Well, at least put me
in charge of desserts or drinks,

01:48.020 --> 01:50.632
or what about music?

01:50.675 --> 01:52.634
Okay. Okay, fine.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.157
May-Maybe not music,

01:54.201 --> 01:56.638
but putting me
on napkin duty feels like--

01:56.681 --> 01:58.988
I don't know--
a waste of my talents.

01:59.031 --> 02:01.164
Okay, well, uh,

02:01.208 --> 02:02.557
you want to do plates, too?

02:02.600 --> 02:03.862
All right, plates.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.516
Got my foot in the door.

02:06.822 --> 02:09.520
Great. Now go put your foot
in some pants!

02:10.478 --> 02:12.436
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:12.480 --> 02:14.003
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:18.703 --> 02:20.227
Hey, Ma.Hi, Mama.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.490
Hey, boys. How was work?Oh, it was great!

02:22.533 --> 02:24.013
One of our satellites
discovered water...

02:24.056 --> 02:25.449
Not you, Marty.
I meant Malcolm.

02:28.191 --> 02:29.584
Oh, it was kind of cool, Ma.

02:29.627 --> 02:31.107
I like being
a security guard.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.456
Today, I got
to handcuff somebody

02:32.500 --> 02:34.415
who tried to sneak in
without their ID badge.

02:34.458 --> 02:37.418
Ooh.Hey, man, I told you,
I left it in the car!

02:39.333 --> 02:42.249
Well, how was I supposed to know
you was telling the truth?

02:43.206 --> 02:44.686
You saw it in
the cupholder

02:44.729 --> 02:46.209
when I drove you to work.

02:47.819 --> 02:50.474
You know what? Thank you for
getting me the job, little bro,

02:50.518 --> 02:53.738
and, uh, don't forget
your badge tomorrow.

02:53.782 --> 02:55.740
Yeah, Marty.
Be more professional.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.525
What?!

02:57.568 --> 02:59.135
All right.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.877
Well, my smoker's clean,
my knives are sharp,

03:01.920 --> 03:03.487
and my playlist
is ready.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.620
I'm gonna start out with
a little Earth, Wind & Fire.

03:05.663 --> 03:07.883
Okay.And I'm gonna end it
with some Jimmy Buffett.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.363
Jimmy Buffett?Jimmy Buffett?

03:09.406 --> 03:12.148
It cracks me up
to see Dave dance.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.890
Okay. Okay.

03:14.933 --> 03:17.240
Okay. Okay.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.067
Okay.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.851
All right.Aw. Baby,

03:19.895 --> 03:23.072
I'm so proud of you for letting
him be a part of the Yardecue.

03:23.115 --> 03:25.640
Whoa. Wait a minute.
You're letting Dave help out?

03:25.683 --> 03:27.076
Oh, it's nothing.

03:27.119 --> 03:28.556
I'm just letting him
bring napkins and plates.

03:28.599 --> 03:32.255
Uh, wait, wait, Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.344
You gave Dave napkins
and plates?

03:34.388 --> 03:37.826
I've been stuck
on folding chairs for ten years!

03:37.869 --> 03:39.480
And when you get that right,

03:39.523 --> 03:42.352
I'll give you napkins
and plates.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.049
Uh, wait a minute.

03:44.093 --> 03:46.313
Admit it, Pop.
You like Dave.

03:46.356 --> 03:48.184
Yeah.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.186
What?! What?!Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.840
ALL:
Yeah.

03:51.883 --> 03:54.016
Don't nobody like no damn Dave.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.019
Baby, you two
look pretty happy

03:57.062 --> 03:58.890
in your photo at the top
of Splash Mountain.

03:58.934 --> 04:00.240
MALCOLM and MARTY:
Mm-hmm.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.198
He just got sprayed in the face

04:02.242 --> 04:03.808
by the mechanical rabbit.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.897
It's why I bought the photo.

04:07.072 --> 04:09.466
Okay, uh,
what about that farmer's market

04:09.510 --> 04:11.294
y'all went to
last Sunday?
Ah.
Oh.

04:11.338 --> 04:14.254
It's a farmer's market.
You got to take a white dude.

04:15.733 --> 04:18.606
Baby, there's no shame
in admitting that you like him.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.172
Yeah, he's a good guy, Dad.TINA:
Yeah.

04:20.216 --> 04:21.696
And he's a
good neighbor.

04:21.739 --> 04:25.177
Fine. I mean,
maybe he a'ight.

04:25.221 --> 04:27.049
He's all right.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.877
ALL:
Oh...

04:28.920 --> 04:30.922
you love him!

04:30.966 --> 04:32.272
You love him!

04:32.315 --> 04:34.012
Want to be together.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.666
MARTY:
Oh, that feeling.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.285
Hey, Tina.What's up, Gemma?

04:45.328 --> 04:46.721
Can I borrow some milk?

04:46.764 --> 04:48.244
Sure. What kind
do you want?

04:48.288 --> 04:51.073
We have almond, oat,
coconut, macadamia.

04:51.116 --> 04:52.553
Oh, so you don't have milk?

04:52.596 --> 04:54.119
I'll just go to the store.

04:54.163 --> 04:56.948
Hang on, hang on!
Before you go,

04:56.992 --> 04:59.037
I got you a present.

04:59.081 --> 05:01.736
It's for our one-year
anniversary as friends.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.085
Oh, that's so sweet.

05:03.128 --> 05:05.348
I didn't get you anything.
I feel bad.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.045
Oh, you don't have
to feel bad.

05:07.089 --> 05:09.483
I...
Let me see
what you got!

05:12.703 --> 05:15.358
It's a...
It's a, uh...

05:15.402 --> 05:16.794
Peasant blouse!

05:16.838 --> 05:19.231
Exactly!

05:19.275 --> 05:22.147
It's just like the one I have
that you complimented me on.

05:22.191 --> 05:26.630
Oh, what a good
memory you have.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.763
Do you love it?

05:28.806 --> 05:30.808
Well, to be honest...

05:30.852 --> 05:32.419
not really.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.464
No, no, no,
but listen.

05:34.508 --> 05:37.206
I really appreciate
the thought, honestly.

05:38.512 --> 05:40.035
Oh. I'm sorry.

05:40.078 --> 05:42.646
I just... I figured
you would like it.

05:42.690 --> 05:45.301
And maybe we'd be twinsies.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.781
Gemma, you don't
have to be sorry.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.957
I mean, we're not gonna
always like the gifts

05:49.000 --> 05:50.437
that we give each other.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.961
Like those hoop earrings
that I gave you that you hate.

05:54.789 --> 05:56.747
I don't hate
those earrings.

05:56.791 --> 05:59.271
I love them.

06:01.404 --> 06:02.579
Please.

06:02.623 --> 06:05.539
Well... I do.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.192
So why don't you
ever wear them?

06:07.236 --> 06:10.587
I was just waiting
for a special occasion.

06:10.631 --> 06:11.893
Okay.Like

06:11.936 --> 06:14.939
Grover's third grade graduation,
or his wedding.

06:14.983 --> 06:17.638
All right, I'll see you later.

06:17.681 --> 06:20.597
Wait. Since you don't like the
blouse, I'll just take it back.

06:20.641 --> 06:23.252
No, no, no. I'm gonna save it
for a special occasion,

06:23.295 --> 06:25.080
like Grover's wedding.

06:35.873 --> 06:38.006
DAVE:
Hey, Calvin, you
in the kitchen?

06:38.049 --> 06:42.227
Oh, we just letting ourselves
into each other's houses now?

06:43.359 --> 06:45.100
Picked up the napkins
and the plates.

06:45.143 --> 06:46.449
Went with the clear ones

06:46.493 --> 06:48.538
so you can see the food
from both sides.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.890
Ooh, looks like you're
making your sauce.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.501
Yeah, that's right.

06:54.544 --> 06:57.329
Everyone back at home
loved my sauce.

06:57.373 --> 06:58.766
I have a secret ingredient.

06:58.809 --> 07:01.464
Oh, good. Why don't you
keep it a secret?

07:02.813 --> 07:05.120
All right,
you dragged it out of me.

07:07.078 --> 07:08.689
It's Worcestershire sauce.

07:08.732 --> 07:10.691
Look, Sorry, Dave,

07:10.734 --> 07:12.780
but I'm not using anything
in my sauce

07:12.823 --> 07:14.738
that has the word "worst" in it.

07:14.782 --> 07:16.479
Are you sure?

07:16.523 --> 07:18.916
Because this stuff gives
the meat a certain tang.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.309
Hey, hey.

07:20.352 --> 07:21.963
You keep your tang away
from my meat.

07:22.006 --> 07:24.705
Okay, Calvin, you know,
you're not the only one

07:24.748 --> 07:26.924
around here who knows
how to make ribs.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.448
Come on, Dave.

07:28.491 --> 07:31.276
I mean, how would you feel
if I showed up in Kalamazoo

07:31.320 --> 07:35.411
and started hosting one
of your, uh, pumpkin festivals?

07:35.455 --> 07:38.283
Calvin, one call,
and I can make that happen.

07:39.894 --> 07:42.679
That's a big no-go
to both, okay?

07:42.723 --> 07:45.421
All right, but, uh,

07:45.465 --> 07:48.511
you don't know what
you're, uh, "Michigan."

07:50.513 --> 07:53.690
Come on. You laughed at
that at the farmer's market!

07:58.695 --> 08:01.524
Calvin, why do you tell
everyone to show up at noon

08:01.568 --> 08:03.308
if the ribs aren't
ready till 3:00?

08:03.352 --> 08:05.659
Because I know
this neighborhood,

08:05.702 --> 08:09.358
and if I told y'all 3:00,
you wouldn't show up till 5:00.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.883
Why? 'Cause we black?

08:12.927 --> 08:14.189
Yeah.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.675
Hey, Grover.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.503
I like your haircut.

08:23.546 --> 08:25.287
What are you talking about?

08:25.330 --> 08:27.724
I didn't get a haircut.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.813
Well, it looks nice.

08:29.857 --> 08:32.729
I'm gonna be over here.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.384
Hey, Grover, Grover.

08:35.427 --> 08:37.342
Come on over here, man.

08:37.386 --> 08:39.910
We saw you over there
talking to Kayla Watkins.

08:39.954 --> 08:42.173
Mm-hmm.
No. Blech!

08:42.957 --> 08:44.828
I think she likes you.

08:44.872 --> 08:46.351
Really?

08:46.395 --> 08:48.789
Yeah, man.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.094
Are you sure?

08:50.138 --> 08:53.097
'Cause she punched me
in the arm yesterday.

08:53.141 --> 08:55.099
BOTH:
Oh.

08:55.143 --> 08:57.667
You got a girlfriend.

09:07.982 --> 09:10.158
Oh. Hey, Tina.

09:10.201 --> 09:13.291
Oh. I see you're wearing
the earrings.

09:13.335 --> 09:15.859
I didn't know Grover
was getting married today.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.514
Well, I realized

09:18.558 --> 09:21.125
a lot of the neighbors
here don't know my name.

09:21.169 --> 09:23.388
They will now.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.913
Oh, come on, Gemma.

09:25.956 --> 09:28.393
I told you you don't have
to pretend to like them.

09:28.437 --> 09:30.570
I got them for you
before I knew your style.

09:30.613 --> 09:33.007
How can you say that?
They are totally me.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.835
Ow.

09:34.878 --> 09:37.054
Oh.
Ow, ow, ow! It's
caught on my sleeve.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.969
Oh. Uh, okay, okay.Ow. Ah, ow.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.536
Ow. Ow!Okay, well, don't...

09:40.580 --> 09:44.366
Calvin, how much longer we got
to wait for those ribs, man?

09:44.409 --> 09:45.628
Ten minutes.

09:45.672 --> 09:48.109
You said that
ten minutes ago!

09:48.152 --> 09:50.720
And what you gonna
do about it?

09:50.764 --> 09:53.462
I'm gonna go
get some chips.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.901
See, all y'all need
to learn some patience.

09:57.945 --> 10:00.774
You get ribs
when I give you ribs.

10:00.817 --> 10:03.690
It ain't like
you got another choice.

10:03.733 --> 10:06.257
Come on, everybody.
Who's ready for some ribs?!

10:08.738 --> 10:11.001
Take Jimmy Buffett
off the playlist!

10:16.572 --> 10:18.487
Get back. Get-get-get, y'all get
away from them ribs. Get back.

10:18.530 --> 10:22.491
You! You. You.

10:22.534 --> 10:24.058
Calvin, what
are you doing?

10:24.101 --> 10:26.713
What am Idoing?
What are you doing?

10:26.756 --> 10:28.018
Oh, I-I know, I know.

10:28.062 --> 10:29.672
But I just... I
couldn't help myself.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.674
Besides, what's wrong
with a little variety?

10:31.718 --> 10:33.023
Variety sound good to me.

10:34.068 --> 10:35.635
Stop testing me, Trey.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.680
Calvin, come on.

10:37.724 --> 10:38.986
People want to try them.

10:39.029 --> 10:42.554
Let them have a little
taste of my tang.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.166
I told you not to do this.

10:45.209 --> 10:47.081
Come on, man,
you crossed the line here.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.996
Why are you making such
a big deal out of this?

10:49.039 --> 10:52.216
Calvin, I'm a part of this
neighborhood, too.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.522
Just because you live here

10:53.565 --> 10:55.785
doesn't mean you're a part
of the neighborhood.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.831
Well, I disagree.Oh, really?

10:57.874 --> 11:00.660
Uh, what's Trey's real name?Leslie.

11:04.315 --> 11:08.319
And what did Old Miss Kim's
third husband die of?

11:08.363 --> 11:10.234
Diabetes, but...

11:10.278 --> 11:12.062
some say Old Miss Kim.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.588
Which neighbor danced
with MC Hammer?

11:16.632 --> 11:17.981
Again, Old Miss Kim.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.505
Oh, so we just telling

11:20.549 --> 11:22.594
everybody business now?

11:23.421 --> 11:24.596
You know,

11:24.640 --> 11:27.512
maybe I'm more a part
of this neighborhood

11:27.556 --> 11:28.731
than you thought, Calvin.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.254
You know what, I don't care.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.691
I want you and your ribs

11:31.734 --> 11:34.041
to get out of my yard.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.477
Go.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.392
Okay, fine. Fine.

11:37.435 --> 11:40.351
But if anybody wants some,
they'll be right over here.

11:40.395 --> 11:41.831
In myyard.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.703
You know what?

11:43.746 --> 11:45.052
You can stay out there all day.

11:45.095 --> 11:47.358
Nobody's gonna eat
your barbecue

11:47.402 --> 11:49.578
because they'll be too busy

11:49.621 --> 11:50.710
eating mine!

11:50.753 --> 11:52.059
All right!
All right, yeah!Hey, yeah!

11:52.102 --> 11:53.669
In, like, ten minutes, guys.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.023
Come on, Grover. Don't be shy.

12:00.067 --> 12:02.417
Just go over there
and talk to her.

12:02.460 --> 12:03.766
Okay.

12:03.810 --> 12:07.291
But do I tell her she's stupid
or she's gross?

12:08.336 --> 12:10.207
Uh, fair question.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.775
I was thinking
"I like your smile,"

12:12.819 --> 12:15.299
but you do you, man.Yeah.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.561
Hey, listen, man,

12:16.605 --> 12:18.520
opening lines
are always the hardest part.

12:18.563 --> 12:19.782
Yeah, you just
got to be cool.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.566
A-And tell her something
about yourself.

12:21.610 --> 12:24.395
Well, I'm starting third grade,

12:24.439 --> 12:26.267
and I like lizards.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.921
Oh!Sounds to me

12:27.964 --> 12:29.836
like you got this in the bag.

12:29.879 --> 12:32.316
I got you,
little brother.No? Okay, all right.

12:35.145 --> 12:37.104
What are you doing?

12:37.147 --> 12:38.801
Icing my ear.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.238
I hugged Old Miss Kim,
and it got caught

12:41.282 --> 12:43.806
on what everyone now knows
is a wig.

12:44.938 --> 12:46.896
Gemma, just take them off.

12:46.940 --> 12:50.247
No. I was taught that when
someone gives you a present,

12:50.291 --> 12:52.902
the right thing to do is
to show you appreciate it.

12:52.946 --> 12:55.426
Well, I was taught
that honesty is the best policy.

12:55.470 --> 12:58.255
Well, then, I guess I was
just raised differently.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.910
ALL:
Ooh!

13:02.869 --> 13:04.827
She just call your mama a ho.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.743
What?! No, I didn't!

13:07.787 --> 13:09.353
That's what I heard.

13:09.397 --> 13:11.007
No! No, no, no, no. Wait!

13:11.051 --> 13:14.924
Wait, I-I just meant that we
were raised in separate worlds.

13:14.968 --> 13:17.666
You know, separate but equal.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.323
Okay, let's get you inside

13:22.366 --> 13:24.847
before you have to ice
more than your ear. Come on.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.980
This way. This way.Okay.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.416
Don't you...Smell that?

13:28.459 --> 13:30.897
Delicious Michigan
barbecue right over here.Hey!

13:30.940 --> 13:33.769
Hey, you keep the smell
of your ribs off my property.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.989
Come on, everyone.
Try something new.

13:36.032 --> 13:39.949
Or stick with tradition
and don't be a sellout.

13:39.993 --> 13:42.125
What the hell are you doing,
Uncle Tom?

13:42.169 --> 13:43.474
Whoa!

13:43.518 --> 13:45.215
Calvin, don't you think
that's a little harsh?

13:45.259 --> 13:46.521
No.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.479
That's my Uncle Tom.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.613
And you would know that

13:51.656 --> 13:54.181
if you were really a part
of this neighborhood.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.748
Man, forget this.
I'm hungry.Trey,

13:56.792 --> 13:57.967
if you cross that line,

13:58.011 --> 14:00.056
I'm-a tell child
support you got a job.

14:01.318 --> 14:05.105
Now, Dave,
you can stand out here all day.

14:05.148 --> 14:08.369
But as long as I'm here,
nobody's crossing that line.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.197
Okay, fine, Calvin.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.853
It's your neighborhood,
your Yardecue.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.902
But I'm taking these
napkins with me!

14:21.425 --> 14:22.600
Somebody find Marty.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.515
He just got a promotion.

14:26.517 --> 14:28.606
Uh, hey, Kayla.

14:28.650 --> 14:29.956
Hey, Grover.

14:29.999 --> 14:33.133
So, uh... you like lizards?

14:33.176 --> 14:34.743
No.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.876
Me, neither.

14:38.747 --> 14:40.270
Um...

14:40.314 --> 14:43.491
are you excited about
starting third grade?

14:43.534 --> 14:44.448
Totally.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.276
Yeah, me, too.

14:50.237 --> 14:52.413
I asked you about lizards,
right?

14:54.719 --> 14:55.720
Check out little man.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.200
Got her over there smiling.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.245
Yeah, man.

14:58.288 --> 15:00.247
Clearly our swag
is contagious.

15:00.290 --> 15:03.076
We do make
a pretty good team.

15:03.119 --> 15:04.555
Hey, Malcolm. Hey, Marty.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.775
Looking good.

15:06.818 --> 15:09.778
Yeah, thank you. Appreciate
that, young lady.Oh, thank you.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.127
I was...

15:11.171 --> 15:12.520
Oh, wait, why were
you saying thank you?

15:12.563 --> 15:13.869
She was talking to me.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.958
Uh, no, she wasn't.
She was clearly talking to me.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.961
Well, if she was talking to
you, why was she looking at me?

15:19.005 --> 15:20.745
Uh, because I am
so good-looking,

15:20.789 --> 15:22.834
she couldn't believe
we're related.

15:24.488 --> 15:26.012
Damn, Calvin.

15:26.055 --> 15:28.014
Your ribs are worth the wait.

15:28.057 --> 15:30.538
That's what I been trying
to tell y'all.

15:31.539 --> 15:33.149
Who does that guy think he is?

15:33.193 --> 15:35.630
Bringing his weak-ass
ribs to yourYardecue.

15:35.673 --> 15:36.848
I know, right?

15:36.892 --> 15:38.502
And who buys clear plates?

15:38.546 --> 15:41.941
You're showing the ants
exactly what you got.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.508
I'm glad you put
him in his place.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.858
Now he knows not to
show up here next year.

15:46.902 --> 15:49.078
Well, I didn't say all that.

15:49.122 --> 15:51.341
That's what I heard.

15:53.387 --> 15:55.824
Well, if you ask me,
that dude's a clown.

15:55.867 --> 15:58.566
Whoa. Whoa, Dave is not a clown.

15:58.609 --> 16:00.046
He may overstep,

16:00.089 --> 16:03.049
but actually,
he's kind of my friend.

16:03.092 --> 16:05.094
If that's how you
treat your friends,

16:05.138 --> 16:07.140
I hate to see how
you treat your enemy.

16:07.183 --> 16:09.533
Well, let me show you.
Give me that.

16:09.577 --> 16:12.580
Go on, now. Go.

16:15.844 --> 16:17.802
Mmm.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.108
Yeah.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.023
That's all right
right there, boy.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.027
TINA:
Okay.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.290
I've got some
rubbing alcohol for you

16:27.334 --> 16:29.423
and some
drinking alcohol for me.

16:31.207 --> 16:33.644
Tina, I'm so sorry
for what I said.

16:33.688 --> 16:37.518
Oh.Could you please explain
to me what I said?

16:37.561 --> 16:40.564
Look, when a white person
says to a black person

16:40.608 --> 16:42.175
they were raised "different,"

16:42.218 --> 16:44.960
it's like saying
they were raised better.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.483
Oh, my God.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.703
I wasn't raised
better than you.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.052
I'm from Hickory Corners.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.054
My mom chews tobacco.

16:53.403 --> 16:56.363
It's okay.
You didn't offend me.Ow.

16:56.406 --> 16:57.407
I know your heart.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.627
But if anybody asks,
I beat your ass.

16:59.670 --> 17:02.369
Deal.

17:02.412 --> 17:03.544
All right.

17:03.587 --> 17:05.850
And I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you

17:05.894 --> 17:07.591
by telling you
I didn't like your gift.

17:07.635 --> 17:08.810
That's okay.

17:08.853 --> 17:10.377
I know your heart, too.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.726
Thank you.

17:11.769 --> 17:14.555
But why did you tell me
it looked cute on me?

17:14.598 --> 17:16.078
Okay.

17:16.122 --> 17:19.081
Here we go. See, on you,

17:19.125 --> 17:21.910
Little House on the Prairie.

17:21.953 --> 17:24.608
On me, 12 Years a Slave.

17:25.609 --> 17:27.089
Get it?Oh.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.091
Yeah.Yeah.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.794
I don't care what he thinks.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.492
I like the tang.

17:40.494 --> 17:42.365
Hey, Dave.

17:42.409 --> 17:45.934
Oh, I guess we're just walking
into each other's houses now.

17:45.977 --> 17:48.502
Come on, man.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.417
Now, it doesn't have
to be like this.

17:50.460 --> 17:51.592
Are you kidding?

17:51.635 --> 17:54.290
You humiliated me
in front of everyone.

17:54.334 --> 17:57.380
Well, you disrespected me when
you showed up with your ribs.

17:57.424 --> 17:58.773
Oh, you want to talk
about disrespect?

17:58.816 --> 18:02.168
I offered to help you out,
and you gave me napkins.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.431
I mean, sure,
I knocked napkins

18:04.474 --> 18:06.998
straight out
of the park, but...

18:07.042 --> 18:08.565
Come on, Dave.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.741
Look, you got to look at this
from where I'm standing.

18:10.785 --> 18:13.527
I've been hosting the
Yardecue for a decade.

18:13.570 --> 18:16.573
Now, here you come, just
trying to take it over.

18:16.617 --> 18:19.228
That's not what
I'm trying to do at all.

18:19.272 --> 18:21.665
I just want to be a part
of the neighborhood.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.102
Look, I know, all right?

18:23.145 --> 18:24.886
But you just got here.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.235
You haven't earned it yet.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.150
It took me 20 years

18:28.194 --> 18:29.717
to be put in charge
of the Yardecue.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.762
Three people had to die.

18:33.155 --> 18:36.376
Two of old age and
one of Old Miss Kim.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.641
Look, man, what I'm saying

18:40.684 --> 18:44.166
is that people have been
waiting a long time,

18:44.210 --> 18:46.299
and you just can't go
skipping the line.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.170
That's not what
you told me at Disneyland.

18:52.914 --> 18:54.829
But I gotcha.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.178
Good. We're cool?

18:56.222 --> 18:57.484
Yeah, we're cool.Cool, man.

18:57.527 --> 19:00.008
Come on, let's go back
outside and have a beer.

19:00.051 --> 19:01.140
Man, come on.Okay.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.663
Hey, so, next year...

19:02.706 --> 19:03.925
potato salad?

19:03.968 --> 19:05.274
I'll give you ice.

19:07.058 --> 19:09.191
Marty's gonna be so jealous.

19:18.113 --> 19:20.246
Hey, Vanessa.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.030
Hey, guys. What's up?

19:22.073 --> 19:23.466
When-when you walked by,

19:23.510 --> 19:26.426
uh, earlier...Earlier, we was
just wondering...

19:26.469 --> 19:28.123
You know, um...Which one of us...

19:28.167 --> 19:30.343
Amateurs.

19:34.085 --> 19:35.435
See? I told you

19:35.478 --> 19:36.914
you could rock
those earrings.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.916
You just needed
to adjust your look.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.831
And I told you you
could rock that blouse.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.920
You just needed the
right accessories.

19:42.964 --> 19:45.314
What up, Harriet Tubman?

19:47.969 --> 19:50.189
Aw, hell, no.

19:54.889 --> 19:57.196
So? What do you think?

19:57.239 --> 20:00.068
I got to admit,
Dave, not bad.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.680
I told you you'd like my tang.

20:03.724 --> 20:06.379
That's it. I'm done.
