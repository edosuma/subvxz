WEBVTT

00:07.572 --> 00:09.400
[exhales]

00:09.487 --> 00:11.054
Jane?

00:14.275 --> 00:16.233
[latch clinks]

00:16.320 --> 00:18.279
- Hi, Lisbon.
- What are you doing?

00:18.366 --> 00:19.802
Uh, just working.

00:19.889 --> 00:21.847
Okay, well, out here
in the real world

00:21.934 --> 00:23.458
we have a case.
We have to go.

00:23.545 --> 00:24.937
Yeah. Okay.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.200
Uh..

00:29.681 --> 00:30.682
[latch clinks]

00:43.391 --> 00:45.697
Let's go.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.743
You think you're so mysterious.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.440
I know what you're
doing in there.

00:49.527 --> 00:50.702
Oh, really? What?

00:50.789 --> 00:52.617
You're making a list
trying to figure out

00:52.704 --> 00:54.010
who it is that you've
met that's Red John.

00:54.097 --> 00:55.751
Not just met,
shaken hands with.

00:55.838 --> 00:57.144
How many people are on
that list, anyway?

00:57.231 --> 00:59.668
A lot.

00:59.755 --> 01:02.323
Got a male shooting victim.
Looks to be early 20s.

01:02.410 --> 01:04.107
Happened about an
hour ago. No ID.

01:04.194 --> 01:05.587
- Who called it in?
- Bartender.

01:05.674 --> 01:06.892
We're getting a statement.

01:06.979 --> 01:08.198
What do the witnesses
have to say?

01:08.285 --> 01:10.070
'Uh, not sure.
Cho's talking to them.'

01:10.157 --> 01:11.419
Has thecoroner taken
a look at him yet?

01:11.506 --> 01:12.507
Yeah, he's on his way.

01:12.594 --> 01:14.770
What... what's that on his face?

01:14.857 --> 01:16.076
- What?
- Oh, boy.

01:18.774 --> 01:20.341
Happy anniversary!

01:20.428 --> 01:21.777
[all cheering]

01:21.864 --> 01:25.650
- What's goin' on?
- Come in, everybody!

01:25.737 --> 01:27.348
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:27.435 --> 01:29.306
Ten years ago,
Teresa Lisbon

01:29.393 --> 01:31.091
left the San Francisco
Police Department

01:31.178 --> 01:33.658
'to join the California Bureau
of Investigation.'

01:33.745 --> 01:35.312
Today she is without doubt

01:35.399 --> 01:37.923
the rootinest, tootinest,
sharp-shootinest cop

01:38.010 --> 01:39.664
in the whole state
of California.

01:39.751 --> 01:40.839
Happy anniversary, boss.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.189
[all cheering]
Hear, hear.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.757
So if we could start
the music, please?

01:45.844 --> 01:47.498
- I had no idea.
- Let's party!

01:47.585 --> 01:48.760
Congratulations, Lisbon.

01:48.847 --> 01:50.197
Thank you, Ron.

01:50.284 --> 01:51.415
Why did you do this?

01:51.502 --> 01:52.808
It was Rigsby's idea.

01:54.462 --> 01:55.419
Yeah?

01:55.506 --> 01:57.291
Is he taking
his clothes off?

01:57.378 --> 01:58.814
- He is.
- Oh, my God.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.511
Uh-oh. Yeah.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.513
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Ray.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.167
Haffner. Good to see you.

02:04.254 --> 02:05.560
You know, I really enjoyed
when we worked together.

02:05.647 --> 02:06.735
We should do it again sometime.

02:06.822 --> 02:07.866
Oh, yeah, yeah, you mean

02:07.953 --> 02:09.041
when you almost got me fired?

02:09.129 --> 02:10.086
Yeah, that was
a lot of fun.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.783
Hey, um, can we grab lunch?

02:11.870 --> 02:13.089
There's just something
I wanna discuss with you.

02:13.176 --> 02:14.482
Yeah, sure.

02:14.569 --> 02:16.614
- Alright. I'll call you.
- Jane.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.834
How come he doesn't like me? You
got lunch here, you got..

02:18.921 --> 02:20.705
- Oh, look out.
- What?

02:20.792 --> 02:22.577
Okay, that's enough.
Shoo. Okay?

02:22.664 --> 02:24.405
It was fun.
But not my butt.

02:26.189 --> 02:29.105
That was the office.
Homicide out in Placer County.

02:29.192 --> 02:30.324
The team that was supposed
to cover for us today

02:30.411 --> 02:32.064
can't make it out there.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.632
Well, I don't think we can
drag Lisbon away from this.

02:34.719 --> 02:37.026
- Can't we cover it, Cho?
- Yeah. Yeah, we can.

02:37.113 --> 02:40.638
Okay. Where did you
find that guy?

02:40.725 --> 02:42.510
That was fun.
But we're done, okay?

02:42.597 --> 02:43.772
Oh, yeah.
Those are nice moves.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.695
CBI. I'm Agent Cho,
this is Patrick Jane.

02:53.782 --> 02:55.349
Rick Anaya.
Chief here in Elliston.

02:55.436 --> 02:57.351
Good to meet you.
This way.

02:57.438 --> 02:59.004
The bodies were found
in a secret basement

02:59.091 --> 03:00.876
under the barn floor.

03:00.963 --> 03:02.443
And what's with
the secret basement?

03:02.530 --> 03:03.618
Yeah, probably
built in the '20s

03:03.705 --> 03:05.750
to hide booze
during prohibition.

03:05.837 --> 03:07.274
My dad, who was
chief before me

03:07.361 --> 03:09.450
said there used to be stills
all through these parts.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.016
Kids were playing
in the barn

03:11.103 --> 03:15.107
found a trap door,
went in, found some bones.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.371
If you boys are still
in town for dinner

03:17.458 --> 03:19.286
Ella's Diner
on Allen street..

03:19.373 --> 03:21.418
...best damn chili in town.

03:25.335 --> 03:27.163
What's the coroner say?

03:27.250 --> 03:29.905
Well, right now he's guessing
they died 20, 25 years ago.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.211
Whoa.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.864
'He confirms
three bodies in all.'

03:37.086 --> 03:38.653
What is it?

03:38.740 --> 03:40.655
Uh, looks like
a shotgun pellet.

03:40.742 --> 03:42.961
Yeah, we found some
of those under the bones.

03:43.048 --> 03:46.138
Figured they fell out
the body as they decomposed.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.531
[Ricky]
'No shell casings
in here, though.'

03:47.618 --> 03:49.881
Must have shot them
somewhere else

03:49.968 --> 03:51.318
brought the bodies here.

03:53.015 --> 03:56.192
- 'Anything else?'
- Yeah, a couple of things.

03:56.279 --> 04:00.283
High school class ring.
Guess it fell off one of them.

04:00.370 --> 04:01.632
We'll check that out.
Is that it?

04:01.719 --> 04:04.635
No, this, .38.

04:04.722 --> 04:06.333
And one round's
been fired.

04:06.420 --> 04:09.771
Not in here,
as far as we can tell.

04:09.858 --> 04:12.121
You see that wire?

04:12.208 --> 04:13.688
On the wrist?

04:13.775 --> 04:15.167
'See, I'm guessing
at least two of the victims'

04:15.255 --> 04:16.473
'were tied up with it.'

04:16.560 --> 04:17.909
This is very depressing.

04:17.996 --> 04:19.737
I'm gonna wait outside.

04:20.869 --> 04:23.480
[intense music]

04:34.143 --> 04:37.059
[birds chirping]

04:42.020 --> 04:44.632
[music continues]

05:15.750 --> 05:18.013
[theme music]

05:26.238 --> 05:27.892
[birds chirping]

05:27.979 --> 05:30.025
The Red John symbol
was on the side of the barn?

05:30.112 --> 05:32.070
- That's weird.
- Yeah.

05:32.157 --> 05:34.334
Must have been there
15, 20 years.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.945
Wonder what it means.
What did Jane say?

05:37.032 --> 05:38.642
Nothing. Wouldn't talk about it.

05:38.729 --> 05:42.603
Okay. Everybody feel
as bad as I do?

05:42.690 --> 05:44.996
- Not if you feel like you look.
- I feel fine.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.824
What time did you get back
to the party last night?

05:46.911 --> 05:48.826
A little past 10:00.
Not that you noticed.

05:48.913 --> 05:51.873
Yeah. That, uh, Tequila
was a killer.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.661
Did I, uh...do
anything embarrassing?

05:57.748 --> 05:59.533
- Yes.
- Really? What?

05:59.620 --> 06:01.665
Good morning.
Thank you for the party.

06:01.752 --> 06:03.928
- It was very thoughtful.
- You're welcome.

06:04.015 --> 06:07.454
But I am never gonna forgive
you for that stripper.

06:07.541 --> 06:08.977
Where are we
with the three victims?

06:09.064 --> 06:12.415
Coroner says they probably
died 25 years ago, so 1988.

06:12.502 --> 06:13.982
Talked to
the ring manufacturer.

06:14.069 --> 06:16.680
They traced it back
to a Lester Bradovich

06:16.767 --> 06:18.203
who went to a high school
in Dixon.

06:18.290 --> 06:19.379
Checking him out now.

06:19.466 --> 06:20.380
The gun that was found near

06:20.467 --> 06:21.772
the bodies isn't registered.

06:21.859 --> 06:23.600
No sign of the bullet
that was fired, either.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.559
But I've got techs sweeping
the area around the barn.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.082
Nice work. Let me
know what you find.

06:28.953 --> 06:30.172
She was kidding, right?

06:30.259 --> 06:31.521
- About never forgiving?
- Nope.

06:35.525 --> 06:36.744
How was the rest
of the party?

06:36.831 --> 06:39.181
Torture. That can never,
ever happen again.

06:39.268 --> 06:40.617
Ten years, huh?

06:40.704 --> 06:42.053
More, actually.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.621
Every year with you
counts as two.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.318
Are those from the crime scene?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.711
Yes.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.110
This can't be
a coincidence, can it?

06:55.197 --> 06:57.329
There's no such thing.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.115
These murders happened ten years
before Red John was even active.

07:00.202 --> 07:01.725
A shotgun was never
his weapon of choice.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.379
True.

07:03.466 --> 07:05.468
'Well, what happened?
How'd it get there?'

07:06.513 --> 07:09.341
Hmm.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.606
They're excellent questions.
You know where to find me.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.350
Got a hit
on Lester Bradovich.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.700
He had a couple
of arrests in the mid-'80s.

07:19.787 --> 07:22.790
Small stuff. Possession,
drunk and disorderly.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.444
No record of him
after 1987.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.141
- Family?
- A brother in town.

07:26.228 --> 07:27.795
But here's the weird
thing, nobody ever filed

07:27.882 --> 07:29.361
a missing persons report on him.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.711
That's odd,
you and Rigsby go

07:30.798 --> 07:31.929
and see what
the brother has to say.

07:32.016 --> 07:33.191
Alright.

07:35.193 --> 07:39.067
So what didI do last night?
Come on. I'm dying here.

07:39.154 --> 07:41.809
You got up on the table
and sang "Bohemian Rhapsody."

07:41.896 --> 07:43.898
Oh. I do a pretty good
Freddie Mercury.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.421
That's not so embarrassing.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.162
Maybe not for you.

07:47.249 --> 07:48.424
Gordon Bradovich?

07:48.511 --> 07:50.426
Yeah?

07:50.513 --> 07:52.384
We need to talk to you
about your brother Lester.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.996
Lester? Are you serious?

07:55.083 --> 07:57.172
[sighs]

07:57.259 --> 07:59.609
You're-you're positive
it's Lester?

07:59.696 --> 08:01.959
We're waiting for final
confirmation from the coroner.

08:02.046 --> 08:04.005
But we're pretty sure, yeah.

08:04.092 --> 08:06.703
This is just unreal.

08:06.790 --> 08:09.184
When was your last contact
with your brother?

08:09.271 --> 08:12.013
Oh, God, uh, sometime
in the late '80s.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.754
So you haven't seen him
in almost 25 years

08:13.841 --> 08:15.233
but you never reported him
missing. Why is that?

08:15.320 --> 08:17.279
We didn't think
he was missing.

08:17.366 --> 08:18.541
I don't understand.

08:18.628 --> 08:21.762
Lester had been
in a lot of trouble.

08:21.849 --> 08:25.330
Drugs and scrapes
with the law, and..

08:25.417 --> 08:27.245
...then, uh when
he was about 24

08:27.332 --> 08:30.031
he-he joined with this,
uh, this group.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.511
A little weird, but, uh

08:31.598 --> 08:33.687
very strict, very
disciplined.

08:33.774 --> 08:34.949
Seemed to straighten him out.

08:35.036 --> 08:36.211
He, uh, he got calmer

08:36.298 --> 08:37.778
stopped getting
into trouble.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.649
And what does that have to do
with his disappearance?

08:39.736 --> 08:41.303
Well, after about
a year with them

08:41.390 --> 08:43.392
he, uh, he came
to my dad and me

08:43.479 --> 08:46.830
and he said that he had
to break off all contact

08:46.917 --> 08:49.964
with his biological family.

08:50.051 --> 08:52.053
Yeah, his group said
that this was the only way

08:52.140 --> 08:54.751
his true identity
could emerge.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.623
We were pretty hurt.

08:56.710 --> 08:59.016
But Lester, he was totally
matter-of-fact about it.

08:59.103 --> 09:01.236
Had to be done.

09:01.323 --> 09:05.588
That was...the last
time I talked to him.

09:05.675 --> 09:07.677
Now you're telling me
he's been dead all this time?

09:07.764 --> 09:10.375
I just, I-I don't
even know what to think.

09:10.462 --> 09:11.899
What's the name
of the group?

09:11.986 --> 09:13.727
Vision.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.076
No.

09:15.163 --> 09:18.383
Visualize.

09:18.470 --> 09:19.602
You've heardof it?

09:24.259 --> 09:25.695
- Hello?
- Teresa.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.218
Ray Haffner. I've been
looking for you.

09:27.305 --> 09:29.264
Hey, Ray. What's up?

09:29.351 --> 09:31.614
I was wondering if we could
snag that lunch today

09:31.701 --> 09:33.660
at one o'clock at
the State House Cafe.

09:33.747 --> 09:36.401
Sure. You wanna tell me what
this is about? I'm intrigued.

09:36.488 --> 09:38.795
Then my plan is working.
I'll see you then.

09:38.882 --> 09:40.449
- What does he want?
- Lunch.

09:40.536 --> 09:41.711
- Mm.
- Mm.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.452
Mr. Jane. Agent Lisbon.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.497
Good to see you again.
Jason Cooper.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.804
Brother Cooper. Ah.

09:47.891 --> 09:51.025
Last time, uh, I saw you was,
uh, when Bret Stiles

09:51.112 --> 09:53.070
had just uncovered your plan
to take over this place.

09:53.157 --> 09:54.419
I thought he would have
gutted you like a trout

09:54.506 --> 09:55.856
but here you are.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.597
Bret's generosity
is only exceeded

09:57.684 --> 09:59.816
by his capacity
for forgiveness.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.949
Is Mr. Stiles here? We need
to speak with him.

10:02.036 --> 10:04.038
Unfortunately, Bret was called
out of the country this morning.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.169
Convenient.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.431
But he asked me to answer

10:06.518 --> 10:07.868
any question you have.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.173
Won't you come this
way? There's tea.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.962
Lester Bradovich belonged
to our church, I believe there's

10:15.049 --> 10:16.572
a good chance that
all three of the bodies

10:16.659 --> 10:18.400
you found were church members.

10:18.487 --> 10:20.315
Well, what makes you
say that, Mr. Cooper?

10:20.402 --> 10:22.230
These murders occurred in 1988.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.928
At that time, Visualize
owned the Elliston farm.

10:25.015 --> 10:26.930
Everyone who worked there
was a member of the church.

10:27.017 --> 10:29.541
Why did Bret Stiles
own a farm?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.152
He had a dream.

10:31.239 --> 10:34.068
He saw Visualize controlling
an agricultural empire

10:34.155 --> 10:36.853
based on wheat, but he
wanted each of the farms

10:36.940 --> 10:38.594
to be a self-sustaining
bio-community.

10:38.681 --> 10:41.771
So they had to raise their own
vegetables and livestock.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.686
It was a grand vision.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.645
The church bought
a half-dozen farms.

10:45.732 --> 10:49.039
Half a dozen? All run by people
that knew nothing about farming?

10:49.126 --> 10:50.519
Let's just say that enthusiasm

10:50.606 --> 10:52.826
was a poor substitute
for expertise.

10:52.913 --> 10:55.611
They all failed
in a year or two.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.308
Lester Bradovich
ran the Elliston farm

10:57.395 --> 10:59.049
with two others..

10:59.136 --> 11:02.357
...Martin Talbot
and Allan Charney.

11:02.444 --> 11:05.839
That's what we have on them.

11:05.926 --> 11:08.885
'In July of 1988, when we hadn't
had any word for some weeks'

11:08.972 --> 11:11.322
we sent people down
to investigate.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.020
They found it empty.

11:13.107 --> 11:15.631
We assumed that Bradovich
and the others had abandoned it.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.634
Why didn't you file
a missing persons report?

11:18.721 --> 11:20.941
They were adults.
We weren't their parents.

11:21.028 --> 11:23.378
We assumed they'd run off.

11:23.465 --> 11:27.643
Besides, we have
found, then and now

11:27.730 --> 11:31.647
that the police rarely take
church complaints seriously

11:31.734 --> 11:33.649
when we do file them.

11:36.913 --> 11:40.090
But we are all horrified
by what happened.

11:40.177 --> 11:43.137
We'll do anything at all
to assist in your investigation.

11:43.224 --> 11:45.879
You have my word.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.228
Hmm.

11:47.315 --> 11:49.665
Martin Talbot was
older. No family.

11:49.752 --> 11:51.493
That explains why nobody
was looking for him.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.234
Allan Charney
had family in Idaho.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.062
They did file a missing
persons report

11:55.149 --> 11:57.020
but nothing ever came of it.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.630
There's no other information
on either one of them.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.241
Alright, call Charney's family

12:00.328 --> 12:01.851
and let them know
what happened.

12:01.938 --> 12:05.725
Visualize is sending down
their files on Elliston farm.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.901
Go through 'em. There might
be something useful.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.251
Alright. Will do.

12:10.338 --> 12:11.774
I hate cold cases.

12:11.861 --> 12:14.298
No evidence, no witnesses
and where do you start?

12:14.385 --> 12:16.474
Oh, it's not so bad.
You know what you need?

12:16.561 --> 12:17.824
A viable suspect?

12:17.911 --> 12:20.827
Big bowl of Chili Verde.
Come on. Let's go.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.706
[indistinct chattering]

12:34.362 --> 12:35.580
Ella's Diner?

12:35.667 --> 12:37.844
Best damn chili
in town, I'm told.

12:37.931 --> 12:40.237
Please tell me we're
not here for chili.

12:40.324 --> 12:43.675
Of course not. We're here
to find a killer.

12:49.551 --> 12:50.813
What are we doing here, Jane?

12:50.900 --> 12:52.641
Look around.

12:52.728 --> 12:57.037
The collective memory of this
entire town is in this room.

12:57.124 --> 12:59.343
Anything that happened
in the last 50 years

12:59.430 --> 13:00.780
you'll find out
about it here.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.564
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.740
- Lemon for your tea?
- No, thanks.

13:04.827 --> 13:06.481
'Ma'am, we're with the CBI.'

13:06.568 --> 13:08.222
We're investigating
some murders

13:08.309 --> 13:10.267
that took place
in town 20 years back.

13:10.354 --> 13:12.182
You mean the three
bodies in the barn?

13:12.269 --> 13:13.575
Yeah, I heard.

13:13.662 --> 13:16.186
The victims were from
a group called Visualize

13:16.273 --> 13:18.362
that owned the farm. Do
you know anything about that?

13:18.449 --> 13:21.670
All I know is that they
found three dead guys.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.019
Can I get you anything else?

13:23.106 --> 13:25.152
No, thanks.
Collective memory?

13:25.239 --> 13:26.762
Uh, if I may

13:26.849 --> 13:28.982
who told you about
the three dead guys?

13:29.069 --> 13:30.244
Everybody knows.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.855
Yes, but who told you?

13:41.821 --> 13:43.518
Look, I don't wanna
get anybody in trouble.

13:43.605 --> 13:46.869
Oh, of course. Thank you.

13:51.134 --> 13:52.919
Patrick Jane.
I'm with the CBI.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.268
What's your name?

13:54.355 --> 13:55.965
Miles MacCambridge. Why?

13:56.052 --> 13:57.662
[Jane]
'This is my colleague,
Teresa Lisbon.'

13:57.749 --> 13:59.099
- Hi.
- You're the town gossip.

13:59.186 --> 14:02.015
- I take it?
- I am?

14:02.102 --> 14:05.018
Retired schoolteacher,
by the looks.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.194
Who's your source
on the murders?

14:07.281 --> 14:08.499
Former student,
I'm guessing?

14:08.586 --> 14:10.414
Am I in some kind of trouble?

14:10.501 --> 14:11.633
- Possibly.
- No, you're not.

14:11.720 --> 14:12.808
Jury's still out.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.592
'We're investigating
the murders'

14:14.679 --> 14:16.681
and we'd really appreciate
it if you could tell us

14:16.768 --> 14:18.814
anything about that farm
that we found the bodies at.

14:18.901 --> 14:22.339
Oh, yeah. Well, it's-it's
been through a lot of hands.

14:22.426 --> 14:23.819
It's not very good land.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.126
No one's worked it
for at least a decade.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.954
What about the group,
Visualize?

14:28.041 --> 14:30.086
They owned the farm
back in the mid-'80s?

14:30.173 --> 14:33.002
Sure, I remember them.
They stuck out.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.135
Pretty useless as farm folk.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.485
How did they get along
with the other people in town?

14:37.572 --> 14:39.574
Were there any conflicts
that you remember?

14:39.661 --> 14:41.837
They mostly kept to themselves.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.795
I remember one person
bitching about 'em

14:43.883 --> 14:46.711
a farmer named Tom Crayhew.

14:46.798 --> 14:49.149
'Couldn't tell you what he was
upset about, too long ago.'

14:49.236 --> 14:51.586
Uh, we really appreciate it.
Thank you.

14:51.673 --> 14:54.328
- So I'm not in any trouble?
- Jury's still out.

14:54.415 --> 14:57.244
- You're fine.
- Look here.

14:57.331 --> 15:00.247
Took me up on
my recommendation, I see?

15:00.334 --> 15:02.205
Tell Elena to put
your check on my tab.

15:02.292 --> 15:06.122
-Aw, that's okay.
- Please. It's a long tab.

15:06.209 --> 15:08.733
Enjoy.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.387
You don't like him.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.389
- Former student?
- Yes.

15:12.476 --> 15:16.306
Mean kid? Pulled on
the girls' pigtails?

15:16.393 --> 15:17.742
He's chief of police

15:17.829 --> 15:20.789
which is a pretty powerful
position around here.

15:20.876 --> 15:21.921
If you'll excuse me.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.319
Is this the stuff
from Visualize?

15:29.406 --> 15:31.843
Yeah, it's mostly letters
from the farm to Visualize

15:31.931 --> 15:33.933
asking for more help
and more money.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.978
And Bradovich, Charney,
and Talbot were the only

15:36.065 --> 15:38.589
full-time workers, but Visualize
was sending temporary people

15:38.676 --> 15:41.723
all the time some members,
some potential recruits.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.551
Their names weren't even
recorded most of the time.

15:43.638 --> 15:45.422
- Most of the time?
- 'Yeah there's one lead.'

15:45.509 --> 15:47.424
A guy named Peter Dibuono
is listed

15:47.511 --> 15:49.687
as working at the
farm in '86 and '87.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.254
'He might be able
to tell us something.'

15:51.341 --> 15:52.952
I reached him on e-mail.
He's coming in to talk.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.823
Good. You and Rigsby
go to Elliston.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.999
Talk to a farmer
named Tom Crayhew.

15:57.086 --> 16:00.263
Apparently he had some sort
of beef with the Visualize farm.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.135
- I'll be back in an hour.
- Where you going?

16:02.222 --> 16:03.397
Lunch.

16:04.746 --> 16:06.269
[Haffner]
'No, no. My hat's off.'

16:06.356 --> 16:08.271
I-I only lasted two
days as Jane's boss.

16:08.358 --> 16:09.707
He nearly killed me.

16:09.794 --> 16:11.840
So you-you clearly
know things that I don't.

16:11.927 --> 16:13.537
He is not that hard to handle.

16:13.624 --> 16:16.758
Really? Seriously?
'Cause I know a couple..

16:16.845 --> 16:19.804
...thousand people who
would disagree with that.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.719
So...ten years?

16:21.806 --> 16:23.721
People keep on saying that.
I don't know why.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.723
I don't feel any different.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.638
I'm hoping it means
you're ready for a change.

16:27.725 --> 16:30.163
Oh, what is that
supposed to mean?

16:30.250 --> 16:32.078
I'm leaving CBI.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.602
I've lined up some capital.
I'm starting my own firm.

16:34.689 --> 16:39.215
Security and investigations
for high-end clients.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.087
I was wondering if you'd
consider coming with me.

16:41.174 --> 16:42.088
Ray.

16:42.175 --> 16:43.393
You're one of the top agents

16:43.480 --> 16:45.308
in the division.
Everyone knows it.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.658
You deserve a position
commensurate with your gifts.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.921
I am flattered, Ray,
but I like my job.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.793
Yeah, I like my job,
too, I'd like it better

16:51.880 --> 16:54.100
if I'd had a raise
in the past three years.

16:54.187 --> 16:56.189
California's broke,
if you didn't notice.

16:56.276 --> 16:59.844
It's not about the money.

16:59.931 --> 17:01.672
That's the starting salary.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.851
That'll keep you in
leather jackets, I think.

17:08.940 --> 17:12.335
It's not about the money.
I like what I do.

17:12.422 --> 17:15.034
It's a good job.
It's good work.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.861
Is it the work,
or is it Jane?

17:16.948 --> 17:18.602
He's part of the work.

17:18.689 --> 17:21.649
Sure. And you guys-you guys
have a track record

17:21.736 --> 17:23.520
I-I understand why you
wanna stick with that.

17:23.607 --> 17:26.567
But if there's one thing
that I've learned about Jane

17:26.654 --> 17:28.351
it's that catching bad guys
is a game to him

17:28.438 --> 17:30.875
and-and he's gonna
quit someday.

17:30.962 --> 17:32.181
Maybe because he gets Red John

17:32.268 --> 17:34.227
maybe because, what,
he just gets bored.

17:34.314 --> 17:37.534
When that happens, you're
gonna be on your own.

17:37.621 --> 17:39.449
Driving out
to some crime scene

17:39.536 --> 17:41.103
in the middle of
nowhere at 5:00 a.m.

17:41.190 --> 17:44.585
Asking Rigsby what
sort of sad story

17:44.672 --> 17:46.413
you gotta unravel this time.

17:49.720 --> 17:50.982
Is that what
you really want?

17:54.290 --> 17:56.553
Because I think
you deserve better.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.512
Think about it.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.093
Mr. Crayhew?

18:18.967 --> 18:22.013
Mr. Crayhew, we're
with CBI. Open up, please!

18:22.101 --> 18:23.319
'I will not be bullied!'

18:23.406 --> 18:24.973
Put the gun down.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.236
You cannot make a man
render unto Caesar

18:27.323 --> 18:29.064
that which he does not
choose to render.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.413
- What?
- Sir.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.893
Whatever the problem is,
we can work it out.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.808
Just put the gun away.

18:33.895 --> 18:35.853
Federal income tax
is an illegal taking

18:35.940 --> 18:38.117
under the Fifth Amendment of the
United States Constitution

18:38.204 --> 18:39.640
and I will not pay it!

18:39.727 --> 18:41.816
- Sir, we're not with the IRS.
- Says you.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.557
We have nothing to do
with your taxes.

18:43.644 --> 18:46.037
We wanna talk about some
killings at a nearby farm.

18:47.517 --> 18:50.607
You're not federal agents?

18:50.694 --> 18:52.043
- You're not here to collect?
- No, sir.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.785
California Bureau
of Investigation.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.570
Now put the gun down.
Do it now.

19:00.617 --> 19:04.012
Yeah, I remember those
clowns from Visualize.

19:04.099 --> 19:06.362
That land's right next to mine.

19:06.449 --> 19:08.495
Killed everything
they-they touched.

19:08.582 --> 19:09.670
Plus they were thieves.

19:09.757 --> 19:11.541
Why thieves?

19:11.628 --> 19:14.153
Well, they stole
my damn water.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.329
I got a stream
up that way.

19:16.416 --> 19:18.026
They diverted it
into their fields

19:18.113 --> 19:19.723
like I wouldn't notice.

19:19.810 --> 19:25.294
So me and my 12-gauge went
to talk it over with them.

19:25.381 --> 19:28.558
I told those wackadoodles
to stop stealing my water

19:28.645 --> 19:30.473
and one of 'em
pulled a revolver.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.258
I thought we were gonna
have a shooting right there.

19:32.345 --> 19:33.694
Do you recall what
kind of revolver it was?

19:33.781 --> 19:35.478
Nope.

19:35.565 --> 19:39.352
Was one of these...the man
that threatened you?

19:45.706 --> 19:47.838
It was that one.

19:47.925 --> 19:52.452
He was wound up.
Had that look, you know?

19:52.539 --> 19:54.280
Just ready to go.

19:54.367 --> 19:57.196
I truly thought I was gonna
have to shoot him right there.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.850
But I didn't.

19:59.937 --> 20:03.767
I didn't.
I swear to God.

20:03.854 --> 20:07.293
But I don't condemn whoever
did shoot him, though.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.556
You've heard how they
treated their animals?

20:09.643 --> 20:11.166
No. How?

20:11.253 --> 20:15.344
They...tortured 'em, basically.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.564
Unnatural stuff.

20:17.651 --> 20:19.087
Satanic ritual stuff.

20:19.174 --> 20:21.437
Really? You know that
for a fact?

20:21.524 --> 20:23.309
You don't believe me,
talk to the vet.

20:23.396 --> 20:24.788
She was on 'em all the time

20:24.875 --> 20:27.965
about how they were
treating their stock.

20:28.052 --> 20:30.229
She was ready to call
the county on 'em.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.795
And what's this vet's name?

20:31.882 --> 20:35.712
I think she retired now. Hmm.

20:35.799 --> 20:38.541
Preston. That's it.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.766
[Jane]
'Hello, Lisbon.'

20:45.853 --> 20:48.421
Are you ever gonna
let me in there again?

20:48.508 --> 20:49.726
'How was lunch?'

20:49.813 --> 20:51.989
Lovely. Haffner
offered me a job.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.778
Really?

20:57.865 --> 21:00.433
- You gonna take it?
- Right now I'm considering it.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.913
Come on. We have to
go talk to the vet.

21:18.233 --> 21:21.105
Wait, this one's for Doug.

21:21.192 --> 21:22.759
Dr. Ellen Preston?

21:22.846 --> 21:24.413
Oh, uh, no, I'm no one.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.286
Dr. Preston's my mom.
I'm Holly Preston.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.244
Holly. Pretty good
with those dogs.

21:29.331 --> 21:31.551
Oh, well, thanks.
I should be.

21:31.638 --> 21:34.510
I'm with them all day.
I run a doggy day care.

21:34.597 --> 21:35.859
Is there something
I can do for you?

21:35.946 --> 21:37.383
We're with the CBI.

21:37.470 --> 21:40.951
We need to ask your
mother some questions.

21:41.038 --> 21:44.085
- Oh.
- Is that a problem?

21:44.172 --> 21:46.435
[Holly Preston]
'She was diagnosed
with Alzheimer's'

21:46.522 --> 21:48.524
'about eight years ago.'

21:48.611 --> 21:50.787
'She still responds
but she's not very good'

21:50.874 --> 21:52.833
'at talking to people anymore.'

21:52.920 --> 21:54.356
'I'm sorry.'

21:54.443 --> 21:55.836
[Lisbon]
'Oh, don't be.'

21:55.923 --> 21:57.054
She looks peaceful.

21:57.141 --> 21:58.839
She is...mostly.

21:58.926 --> 22:00.275
You've probably heard.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.538
'We found three bodies
on a nearby farm.'

22:02.625 --> 22:04.410
'25 years ago,
the farm was owned'

22:04.497 --> 22:07.848
by a church called Visualize.
Does that ring a bell?

22:07.935 --> 22:10.764
I've heard about them.
They made kind of a splash.

22:10.851 --> 22:13.419
[Jane]
'Hi, little boy.
Who's a good boy?'

22:13.506 --> 22:15.464
Yeah. Oh, he likes that.
You like that?

22:15.551 --> 22:18.075
Is...that what you wanted
to talk to my mom about?

22:18.162 --> 22:19.816
We heard that she was concerned

22:19.903 --> 22:22.079
about the way some of the
animals were being treat.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.777
We just wanted to know
what that was about.

22:23.864 --> 22:27.302
Rumor has it they were
performing satanic rituals.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.130
- What?
- We'd heard.

22:29.217 --> 22:33.221
There may have been some
unnatural acts going on.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.571
Have you been talking
to Tom Crayhew?

22:35.658 --> 22:37.051
Why? Does it sound like him?

22:37.138 --> 22:39.532
Oh, exactly like him.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.229
'I would remember if my mom'

22:41.316 --> 22:42.883
'thought something was
happening.'

22:42.970 --> 22:44.711
There were no rituals.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.669
I think my mom
was just concerned

22:46.756 --> 22:48.715
that the farm was failing.

22:48.802 --> 22:50.151
People take it out
on the animals

22:50.238 --> 22:51.500
once a place goes south.

22:51.587 --> 22:52.893
- Did you ever go up there?
- No.

22:52.980 --> 22:57.071
I was 16, and I was
all about boys then.

22:57.158 --> 22:59.595
I wouldn't go to the farm
with my mom if I could avoid it.

22:59.682 --> 23:01.205
Well, all the academic
achievements

23:01.292 --> 23:04.208
suggest you were focused
on a little more than just boys.

23:04.295 --> 23:06.123
Well, maybe now and then

23:06.210 --> 23:08.822
but that was
a long time ago.

23:10.301 --> 23:12.739
Is that all you
wanted to ask about?

23:12.826 --> 23:15.524
Yes. Yeah.
Thank you for your time.

23:15.611 --> 23:17.352
- Jane. Jane.
- Yes. How good is that, huh?

23:17.439 --> 23:20.529
Is that good?
That's really good.

23:20.616 --> 23:22.226
- Jane?
- That's really good.

23:28.276 --> 23:30.060
- Agent Van Pelt?
- Yes?

23:30.147 --> 23:32.802
Father Peter Dibuono.
You asked to see me?

23:32.889 --> 23:34.369
Obviously, I haven't
been a member

23:34.456 --> 23:36.937
of Visualize for some time.

23:37.024 --> 23:39.592
If I were to be kind
to my younger self

23:39.679 --> 23:41.420
I would say that my
time with them

23:41.507 --> 23:45.119
was an early stage
in a long spiritual journey.

23:45.206 --> 23:46.816
What if you
weren't being kind?

23:46.903 --> 23:49.645
I was a stupid punk
who didn't know any better.

23:49.732 --> 23:52.256
Bret Stiles says a lot
of things that sound good

23:52.343 --> 23:54.171
if you don't think
about 'em too hard.

23:54.258 --> 23:55.956
Some of what he says
makes sense, though.

23:56.043 --> 24:00.917
Yes. Uh, there's a core
of truth in every good lie.

24:01.004 --> 24:03.180
All that talk
about self-actualization

24:03.267 --> 24:05.008
can be very, very seductive.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.054
Oh, it's not just seduction.

24:07.141 --> 24:09.056
What's wrong with wanting
to be the most powerful version

24:09.143 --> 24:10.405
of you, you can be?

24:10.492 --> 24:12.102
If you were a good
person it would just

24:12.189 --> 24:13.539
make you an even better one.

24:13.626 --> 24:16.759
Well, it depends on how
you look at it, I guess.

24:16.846 --> 24:19.632
You wanted to ask me
about the Elliston farm?

24:19.719 --> 24:21.242
You worked there, right?

24:21.329 --> 24:24.201
No, I ran it.
From mid-'86 to late '87.

24:24.288 --> 24:26.508
That was a crazy time.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.292
There was a lot of pressure
from Visualize to make

24:28.379 --> 24:31.034
that place work, we just
didn't have the people

24:31.121 --> 24:32.993
or the expertise.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.561
And that's why they brought
Bradovich in to take over.

24:35.648 --> 24:36.649
- Lester Bradovich?
- Mm-hmm

24:36.736 --> 24:38.825
And Lester,
he was..

24:38.912 --> 24:40.653
...a true believer.

24:40.740 --> 24:41.958
He worked people
insanely hard

24:42.045 --> 24:43.525
18, 20 hours a day.

24:43.612 --> 24:48.312
No one lasted long except
for him, Talbot and Charney.

24:48.399 --> 24:52.229
After I left, um, I heard,
this is just a rumor

24:52.316 --> 24:55.581
that-that Lester had been
giving people drugs

24:55.668 --> 24:57.583
to keep them working
when they were tired.

24:57.670 --> 24:58.932
What kind of drugs?

24:59.019 --> 25:00.237
I don't know.
I don't know.

25:00.324 --> 25:02.544
Speed, I would guess.

25:02.631 --> 25:03.893
But he must have
been desperate

25:03.980 --> 25:06.330
because there were
so many ex-addicts

25:06.417 --> 25:07.680
in the church at that time

25:07.767 --> 25:11.031
that Visualize was
very strict about drugs.

25:11.118 --> 25:13.076
If he couldn't get
the drugs from the church

25:13.163 --> 25:14.643
where would he get 'em?

25:14.730 --> 25:15.731
I have no idea.

25:17.777 --> 25:21.084
Father Dibuono.
Uh, Patrick Jane.

25:21.171 --> 25:22.433
Uh, Agent Van Pelt told
me you used to work

25:22.521 --> 25:23.870
on the Elliston farm.

25:23.957 --> 25:27.134
- That's right.
- May I show you something?

25:27.221 --> 25:29.397
Do you know what that is?

25:29.484 --> 25:33.401
Uh, sure.
Yeah, I saw that.

25:33.488 --> 25:34.707
When?

25:34.794 --> 25:36.360
A few months after
I left the farm

25:36.447 --> 25:39.276
I, uh, I went back
for a visit

25:39.363 --> 25:41.017
and that's when I saw it.

25:41.104 --> 25:43.933
Talbot said that some kid who
worked on the farm he did it.

25:44.020 --> 25:45.892
"Some kid," that's all
he said about it?

25:45.979 --> 25:48.068
Yeah, yeah. Some kid.

25:48.155 --> 25:49.678
How old was Talbot?

25:49.765 --> 25:51.811
Uh, 50-something?

25:51.898 --> 25:58.295
Ah. So anyone under the age
of 30 could be "some kid".

25:58.382 --> 26:00.297
You know, I asked
Talbot what it meant

26:00.384 --> 26:01.603
the smiley face.

26:01.690 --> 26:04.693
He said, "What does
anything mean?"

26:04.780 --> 26:09.959
But he said it with this really
deranged expression on his face.

26:10.046 --> 26:13.223
There was a bad vibe
about that place.

26:13.310 --> 26:14.790
Evil.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.925
I didn't spend more than
half an hour there

26:19.012 --> 26:20.230
and I never went back.

26:20.317 --> 26:22.406
And you've never
seen that image

26:22.493 --> 26:24.191
anywhere else ever since?

26:24.278 --> 26:27.716
No. No. But I've been out
of the country a lot.

26:27.803 --> 26:30.066
Missionary work.
Central America.

26:32.982 --> 26:34.375
Is something
the matter, Mr. Jane?

26:34.462 --> 26:37.421
No. No, not at all.
Appreciate your time.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.383
[instrumental music]

26:53.916 --> 26:55.222
When the murders occurred
Bradovich was pushing

26:55.309 --> 26:56.832
'the farm workers
as hard as possible.'

26:56.919 --> 26:58.878
They were stealing water
from neighboring farms

26:58.965 --> 27:01.097
and still failing
to make the farm produce.

27:01.184 --> 27:02.403
How does any of that get
the three of them killed?

27:02.490 --> 27:04.057
Well, I checked on Crayhew.

27:04.144 --> 27:05.493
'He spent some time with a
right-wing militia'

27:05.580 --> 27:07.626
in the mid-'80s. The county
sheriff still thinks

27:07.713 --> 27:09.149
he's got a lot more guns
on that farm.

27:09.236 --> 27:10.977
[Lisbon]
'It wouldn't surprise me.'

27:11.064 --> 27:12.413
What about the forensics team
that was searching the farm?

27:12.500 --> 27:13.632
Did they come up
with anything?

27:13.719 --> 27:14.807
Nothing yet. They're
still looking.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.635
Stay on 'em.

27:16.722 --> 27:19.289
I'm interested in the drugs
the good father mentioned.

27:19.376 --> 27:20.900
He said it was just a rumor.

27:20.987 --> 27:23.424
Well, if Bradovich is working
them around the clock

27:23.511 --> 27:25.861
I'm betting they had
a little chemical help.

27:25.948 --> 27:27.210
And if they didn't
get it from Visualize

27:27.297 --> 27:29.343
then where did
they get it from?

27:29.430 --> 27:32.607
Who knows? Everyone who
could tell us is dead.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.261
Not everyone.

27:35.566 --> 27:37.394
Hmm. Nope.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.528
Don't remember
any of 'em.

27:40.615 --> 27:43.966
Of course, I was just
17 at the time.

27:44.053 --> 27:46.795
Not likely to run
into boys like these.

27:46.882 --> 27:50.451
And, uh, as far
as drug deals in 1988

27:50.538 --> 27:52.627
I couldn't tell you
anything about that.

27:52.714 --> 27:56.065
Wasn't bustin' drug
dealers quite yet.

27:56.152 --> 27:57.676
Would your office
have any record

27:57.763 --> 27:59.678
of drug arrests back then?

27:59.765 --> 28:02.115
A lot of the old files
have been archived.

28:02.202 --> 28:05.031
They're in some
warehouse in Fresno.

28:05.118 --> 28:06.772
I can send somebody
to go look but it's gonna

28:06.859 --> 28:08.687
it's gonna take a while.

28:08.774 --> 28:12.299
Could do that. Or you could just
tell us what drugs you sold 'em.

28:12.386 --> 28:13.735
Excuse me?

28:13.822 --> 28:15.302
You were dealing drugs
back then, weren't you?

28:15.389 --> 28:16.695
And they were clients.

28:16.782 --> 28:19.349
Whatever gives you the
idea that I dealt drugs?

28:19.436 --> 28:22.439
You're self-indulgent.
You're corrupt.

28:22.526 --> 28:24.093
You pretended not
to know Bradovich

28:24.180 --> 28:26.139
when clearly,
you recognize him.

28:26.226 --> 28:27.531
You knew we were gonna
talk about drugs.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.969
So why lie about
not selling 'em?

28:30.056 --> 28:31.884
Look, I'm-I'm not sitting
still for this, okay?

28:31.971 --> 28:34.451
You withhold information from us
during this investigation

28:34.538 --> 28:36.323
it's considered
obstruction of justice.

28:36.410 --> 28:38.064
They'll take your
badge for that.

28:38.151 --> 28:41.154
You might have to start
paying for that Chili Verde.

28:42.155 --> 28:44.070
[gasps]

28:48.596 --> 28:52.165
I might have dealt
a little in high school.

28:52.252 --> 28:55.298
Lot of people did, okay?
It wasn't no big deal.

28:55.385 --> 28:57.823
And by the way, I'm pretty sure
the statute of limitations

28:57.910 --> 28:59.738
has expired on that.

28:59.825 --> 29:03.393
Did you sell drugs
to Bradovich?

29:03.480 --> 29:04.917
This is between us, right?

29:05.004 --> 29:06.353
Law officer
to law officer?

29:06.440 --> 29:07.615
Chief.

29:10.444 --> 29:13.969
He was looking for speed
to keep his people working.

29:14.056 --> 29:16.667
I sold him some.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.713
But right away, he
came back for more.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.150
A lot more.

29:21.237 --> 29:22.978
I didn't have the kind
of quantity he wanted

29:23.065 --> 29:27.983
so I put him in touch with some
serious guys I knew in Stockton.

29:28.070 --> 29:29.724
'Scary dudes.'

29:29.811 --> 29:31.552
Hell, maybe they killed 'em.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.512
I'm gonna need those names.

29:43.607 --> 29:46.001
Two of the drug dealers
Anaya gave us are dead.

29:46.088 --> 29:47.916
The other one's on
death row in Texas.

29:48.003 --> 29:49.613
'I've got a call in to the
Department of Corrections'

29:49.700 --> 29:50.963
'to see if I can interview him.'

29:51.050 --> 29:52.878
Oh, remember
the missing bullet

29:52.965 --> 29:55.010
from the gun we found
near the bodies?

29:55.097 --> 29:56.620
Techs finally found it.

29:56.707 --> 29:58.884
It was buried in the dirt
in front of the barn.

29:58.971 --> 30:00.276
Like somebody had
shot into the ground.

30:00.363 --> 30:01.669
Where outside the barn?

30:01.756 --> 30:03.802
Right in front
of the big painted face.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.021
- Hmm.
- So what do you think?

30:06.108 --> 30:07.806
Should I go to Texas
and talk to this guy?

30:07.893 --> 30:10.417
By all means, take a trek
to the Lone Star state.

30:10.504 --> 30:12.811
But I think I can
solve this case quicker.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.377
How?

30:14.464 --> 30:16.771
Get everyone we've
interviewed to Ella's Diner

30:16.858 --> 30:18.251
first thing tomorrow morning.

30:18.338 --> 30:21.515
- Well, why the diner?
- For the coffee, of course.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.088
Hey, Ray.

30:29.175 --> 30:31.438
Hey. I was, uh,
just checking in.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.266
Seeing if you had a chance
to think about the offer.

30:33.353 --> 30:36.138
I think you already
know my answer.

30:36.225 --> 30:37.748
You're missing out
on something big.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.968
- I'm sure I am.
- How's the case?

30:40.055 --> 30:42.275
- You getting anywhere?
- We're making progress.

30:42.362 --> 30:43.754
Did you get anything from
the stuff Cooper sent down?

30:43.842 --> 30:45.669
No, not much.

30:49.543 --> 30:53.895
Ray, Jason Cooper's name
isn't on that board.

30:53.982 --> 30:56.202
So?

30:56.289 --> 30:59.509
How did you know that
he sent us material?

30:59.596 --> 31:01.250
Someone on your team
must have told me.

31:01.337 --> 31:03.383
No one else knew
except myself and Jane.

31:06.908 --> 31:08.562
Did somebody from
the church tell you?

31:11.173 --> 31:12.653
Ray?

31:12.740 --> 31:14.394
Are you a member
of Visualize?

31:16.613 --> 31:20.487
As a matter of fact, I am.
I don't talk about it much.

31:20.574 --> 31:23.185
People tend to take
it the wrong way.

31:23.272 --> 31:25.274
The way that you're taking
it right now, I think.

31:25.361 --> 31:27.189
- Oh, that's not true.
- Really?

31:27.276 --> 31:29.017
No.

31:30.192 --> 31:31.933
Look, I was a screwed-up kid.

31:32.020 --> 31:35.458
I was headed down a bad path
and some people from Visualize

31:35.545 --> 31:40.289
took an interest and helped
straighten me out.

31:40.376 --> 31:42.988
I-I-I don't think
that Bret Stiles is God.

31:43.075 --> 31:46.382
You know, he just happens to say
some things that I believe.

31:46.469 --> 31:48.471
The money to fund
your agency

31:48.558 --> 31:50.169
is that coming
from Visualize?

31:50.256 --> 31:51.648
Some, not all.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.087
Teresa, stop looking at me

31:55.174 --> 31:56.697
like I just turned into a robot.

31:56.784 --> 31:58.133
It's just me.

32:03.399 --> 32:05.314
[instrumental music]

33:18.474 --> 33:19.649
Just in time, Lisbon.

33:19.736 --> 33:21.695
Morning, Jane. Nice party.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.175
Can I get some of that coffee?

33:23.262 --> 33:24.611
Nope.

33:24.698 --> 33:26.308
This is only for the suspects.

33:26.395 --> 33:27.657
- What?
- For who?

33:27.744 --> 33:29.703
- What did you say?
- That's right.

33:29.790 --> 33:33.272
You're all here because one
of you killed Lester Bradovich

33:33.359 --> 33:36.797
Martin Talbot,
and Allen Charney.

33:36.884 --> 33:39.147
Why would I kill three
members of my own church?

33:39.234 --> 33:40.931
Well, because the
farm was failing

33:41.019 --> 33:42.455
and Bret Stiles didn't
want that to happen.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.326
'But maybe it wasn't you.'

33:44.413 --> 33:46.546
Mr. Bradovich here
was angry with his brother

33:46.633 --> 33:48.548
for abandoning his family.

33:48.635 --> 33:51.333
Even if I was, why would
I kill the other two guys?

33:51.420 --> 33:53.857
Who knows how a
homicidal maniac thinks?

33:53.944 --> 33:55.555
Homicidal maniac?

33:55.642 --> 33:58.123
I was 16, Mr. Jane.

33:58.210 --> 33:59.733
Yes, but your mother
was an adult

33:59.820 --> 34:01.169
and she was angry
with the farmers

34:01.256 --> 34:02.692
over how they were
treating the animals.

34:02.779 --> 34:06.740
Are you seriously saying
my mother killed these people?

34:06.827 --> 34:08.698
You're right. Maybe
it was the priest.

34:08.785 --> 34:11.658
He was angry because he was
displaced as the farm's leader.

34:11.745 --> 34:12.920
No, I wasn't.

34:13.007 --> 34:14.574
Then there's the angry farmer

34:14.661 --> 34:16.315
and the police chief.

34:16.402 --> 34:19.318
Whoever did this, it was
definitely one of you

34:19.405 --> 34:21.363
'and in a moment, we're
gonna find out which one.'

34:21.450 --> 34:23.452
'But first..'

34:23.539 --> 34:25.541
...more coffee, anyone?

34:28.588 --> 34:31.852
- No. No. No. No. No.
- 'Mom, mom.'

34:31.939 --> 34:32.896
- 'No, no, no.'
- 'Mom.'

34:32.983 --> 34:34.420
Mom, take it easy.

34:34.507 --> 34:36.335
What's her problem?
Why's she so upset?

34:36.422 --> 34:38.902
She recognizes the symbol.
There was one at the farm.

34:38.989 --> 34:41.079
- You mean the face on the barn?
- Right.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.037
And she knows what
happened underneath it.

34:43.124 --> 34:44.169
Are you saying
she's the killer?

34:44.256 --> 34:45.474
We're gonna have to ask
your mother

34:45.561 --> 34:46.475
'some questions.'

34:46.562 --> 34:47.694
No. You can't.

34:47.781 --> 34:48.782
Ms. Preston,
you got no choice.

34:48.869 --> 34:50.000
[Holly]
'She won't understand.'

34:50.088 --> 34:51.306
Well, we're gonna
have to try.

34:51.393 --> 34:52.307
Come on. We'll
treat her right.

34:52.394 --> 34:54.092
No. It's not her.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.050
It's me.

34:58.531 --> 35:00.010
It's me.

35:01.795 --> 35:04.493
You thought it was me
when we met, didn't you?

35:04.580 --> 35:06.756
I thought that was
a possibility.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.106
Young woman, high-achieving

35:08.193 --> 35:10.760
ends up running
a doggy day care.

35:10.847 --> 35:14.112
Suggested something went
wrong along the way.

35:14.199 --> 35:16.026
Yeah.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.376
That sounds about right.

35:22.032 --> 35:27.081
My mother was concerned
about the Visualize farm.

35:27.168 --> 35:32.434
I was riding along... when
she made a visit in the area.

35:32.521 --> 35:35.220
[Holly]
And she said she
wanted to check on them.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.047
to see what was going on.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.964
It had rained that day..

35:41.051 --> 35:43.315
So the ground was wet.

35:46.970 --> 35:49.930
You stay here.
I'll be just a minute.

35:55.588 --> 35:58.547
Next thing I knew,
I heard someone shouting.

35:58.634 --> 36:00.375
Don't tell me what to do!
There are laws.

36:00.462 --> 36:01.594
I don't care about
any of your laws!

36:01.681 --> 36:03.030
Laws that say this animal

36:03.117 --> 36:04.684
has to be fed
and taken care of!

36:04.771 --> 36:07.600
And if you won't take care
of it, I will report you!

36:07.687 --> 36:10.429
I...I should..

36:10.516 --> 36:11.821
You want me to take
care of it? Fine!

36:11.908 --> 36:12.953
I'll take care of it!

36:13.040 --> 36:13.997
[gunshot]

36:16.826 --> 36:20.743
He looked so crazy.
Just out of his mind.

36:20.830 --> 36:22.267
Well, he was amped up on speed.

36:22.354 --> 36:24.007
He'd been sleep-deprived
for weeks.

36:24.094 --> 36:27.054
He wasout of his mind.

36:27.141 --> 36:28.969
What happened next?

36:29.056 --> 36:30.753
Oh, you son of a bitch!

36:33.843 --> 36:37.891
- 'Mom!'
- 'No!'

36:39.414 --> 36:42.461
I thought he was gonna
kill my mother.

36:42.548 --> 36:44.724
I had to do something.

36:44.811 --> 36:47.117
Help! Leave her.

36:47.683 --> 36:49.424
Hey!

36:49.511 --> 36:51.078
[gunshot]

36:52.297 --> 36:53.994
[gasping]

36:55.213 --> 36:57.258
I-I don't understand.

36:57.345 --> 37:00.130
Where were Charney and Talbot?
How did they get shot?

37:00.218 --> 37:02.959
I don't know.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.658
What?

37:05.745 --> 37:10.663
I-I don't know anything
about them, I swear. I..

37:10.750 --> 37:12.534
It wasn't me.

37:12.621 --> 37:16.016
What wasn't you?

37:16.103 --> 37:18.584
Holly.

37:18.671 --> 37:21.761
What happened when
you hid the body?

37:24.111 --> 37:27.114
My mother was sure
I could go to jail.

37:27.201 --> 37:29.116
And she couldn't
let that happen.

37:29.203 --> 37:31.988
She wouldn't
let that happen.

37:32.075 --> 37:36.950
[Holly]
She knew there was
a basement in the barn.

37:37.037 --> 37:39.257
So we went down there

37:39.344 --> 37:41.694
and that's when we
found the other two.

37:45.132 --> 37:49.571
Talbot and Charney's bodies
were already there?

37:49.658 --> 37:51.051
I-I guess it was them.

37:51.138 --> 37:53.445
Did you see anything else?
Anything at all?

37:53.532 --> 37:54.750
No.

37:54.837 --> 37:56.491
After we dumped the body

37:56.578 --> 37:58.667
we got out of there
as fast as we could.

38:00.147 --> 38:03.281
[Holly]
I had a feeling..

38:03.368 --> 38:06.458
...someone was there with us.

38:11.071 --> 38:14.030
Someone was watching us.

38:21.734 --> 38:25.041
- Hey. You got a second?
- Sure.

38:25.128 --> 38:28.741
Word is Holly Preston's only
gonna face manslaughter charges

38:28.828 --> 38:30.612
for the homicides.
That true?

38:30.699 --> 38:32.745
We suggested it
to the DDA and he agreed.

38:32.832 --> 38:34.181
Really.

38:34.268 --> 38:36.139
She claims she did it
in self-defense

38:36.226 --> 38:37.750
and we believed her.
She'll serve time.

38:37.837 --> 38:39.491
Three guys got killed.

38:39.578 --> 38:41.493
She only killed one of them,
and it was in self-defense.

38:41.580 --> 38:43.103
That's what she says.

38:43.190 --> 38:45.061
Are you in the business
of taking killers at their word?

38:45.148 --> 38:47.368
I believe her.

38:47.455 --> 38:50.458
Did someone from Visualize
ask you to talk to me?

38:50.545 --> 38:52.242
Because you've never
come to my office

38:52.330 --> 38:54.288
and questioned
my arrests before.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.377
Yeah, I might have
gotten some calls.

38:56.464 --> 38:57.596
Might've heard some concern

38:57.683 --> 38:59.293
that you pushed
for lighter sentences

38:59.380 --> 39:01.339
because the victims
were church

39:01.426 --> 39:03.210
and maybe you
don't like the church.

39:03.297 --> 39:04.777
Absolutely not.

39:04.864 --> 39:06.648
Would you be willing
to push for a murder charge

39:06.735 --> 39:08.258
have another talk
with the DDA?

39:08.346 --> 39:10.173
Absolutely not.

39:11.871 --> 39:14.743
Okay. Had to try.

39:14.830 --> 39:16.528
Thank you
for hearing me out.

39:18.747 --> 39:20.227
Hey, I-I heard
about Jane's trick.

39:20.314 --> 39:22.316
How did he make that symbol
appear on the table?

39:22.403 --> 39:24.579
Lemon juice.
Kid's invisible ink.

39:24.666 --> 39:26.929
The heat from the coffee
pot made it appear.

39:27.016 --> 39:29.105
Lemon juice. Of course.

39:30.803 --> 39:33.066
Hey, Ray.

39:33.153 --> 39:35.895
You said that you joined
Visualize as a teenager.

39:35.982 --> 39:37.984
So 1988, you would have been 21?

39:38.071 --> 39:39.681
Yeah, about that.

39:39.768 --> 39:42.771
Did they ever send you to work
at the Elliston farm?

39:42.858 --> 39:44.207
Were you there?

39:45.731 --> 39:48.821
Lisbon, we're still
friends, right?

39:48.908 --> 39:51.040
Why would you ask me that?

40:04.663 --> 40:05.664
Lisbon.

40:05.751 --> 40:08.188
- Hi, Jane.
- What's up?

40:08.275 --> 40:09.711
I had something
I wanted to tell you

40:09.798 --> 40:11.844
but I've had enough of this.
Let me in, or else.

40:11.931 --> 40:13.323
- Or else what?
- I don't know.

40:13.411 --> 40:14.847
But you're not gonna like it.

40:14.934 --> 40:16.544
Hmm.

40:16.631 --> 40:18.416
Are we partners or what?

40:20.330 --> 40:22.637
Come in, partner.

40:32.865 --> 40:34.649
Wow.

40:34.736 --> 40:36.782
[Jane]
'What did you want
to tell me?'

40:40.960 --> 40:42.788
Visualize absolutely refuses

40:42.875 --> 40:45.268
to let us look at a
membership list from 1988

40:45.355 --> 40:47.619
or any other year
before or after.

40:47.706 --> 40:50.186
And since they're a recognized
religious organization

40:50.273 --> 40:52.798
no judge will give us a warrant.

40:52.885 --> 40:55.235
If Red John was a member
of Visualize in 1988

40:55.322 --> 40:56.236
we'll never know.

40:56.323 --> 40:57.977
Figures.

40:58.064 --> 40:59.674
Never mind.

40:59.761 --> 41:03.591
We know that Red John
was at Elliston farm in 1988.

41:03.678 --> 41:06.115
That is a huge leap
forward, Lisbon. Huge.

41:06.202 --> 41:07.160
How so?

41:09.771 --> 41:13.427
I recalled all the names
of the 2,164 people

41:13.514 --> 41:15.734
that I met and shook hands

41:15.821 --> 41:18.911
with since Red John
murdered my family.

41:18.998 --> 41:21.522
I might have missed
one or two, but not many.

41:21.609 --> 41:25.918
807 of those names
were women.

41:26.005 --> 41:27.833
And Red John's
probably not a woman.

41:27.920 --> 41:31.750
Another 949 were men that
I had brief encounters

41:31.837 --> 41:34.840
with that I never saw
or heard from again.

41:34.927 --> 41:38.539
That leaves 408 names.

41:38.626 --> 41:43.979
And Elliston farm will
exclude a whole bunch more.
