WEBVTT

00:04.033 --> 00:04.867
>> CAITLYN: You know, I've

00:04.867 --> 00:08.667
got five weeks until the ESPYs.

00:08.667 --> 00:10.100
Scared to death of that.

00:10.100 --> 00:11.200
>> CANDIS: What are you most

00:11.200 --> 00:12.267
nervous about?

00:12.267 --> 00:14.333
>> CAITLYN (crying): My family.

00:14.333 --> 00:17.000
(sighs, sniffles)

00:17.000 --> 00:20.400
That's the tough part.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.000
I want them to be proud of their

00:22.000 --> 00:23.833
daddy.

00:23.833 --> 00:26.633
(sniffling)

00:26.633 --> 00:27.667
>> KHLOE: We want to support you

00:27.667 --> 00:29.667
and be there for you, but we

00:29.667 --> 00:31.533
don't think that that entails

00:31.533 --> 00:33.533
you speaking negatively about my

00:33.533 --> 00:34.567
mom.

00:34.567 --> 00:35.633
Let's not drag my mom through

00:35.633 --> 00:36.700
the mud.

00:36.700 --> 00:37.767
I would think you would come

00:37.767 --> 00:39.433
from a place of more compassion,

00:39.433 --> 00:40.733
especially when you have two

00:40.733 --> 00:42.000
young daughters who are greatly

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
affected by it.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.967
>> KIM: You said Kendall and

00:45.967 --> 00:48.400
Kylie were a distraction, and

00:48.400 --> 00:50.000
that's the most unfair thing in

00:50.000 --> 00:51.267
the world to say.

00:51.267 --> 00:52.533
You could have had a little bit

00:52.533 --> 00:53.867
more respect, but I think...

00:53.867 --> 00:55.200
>> CAITLYN: Don't-don't go...

00:55.200 --> 00:56.467
I can see where you're trying to

00:56.467 --> 00:57.400
go here.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.167
Don't go there.

00:59.167 --> 01:00.467
>> KIM: You're losing your

01:00.467 --> 01:03.967
family.

01:03.967 --> 01:04.967
>> CAITLYN: I feel so much

01:04.967 --> 01:06.533
pressure giving this speech.

01:06.533 --> 01:07.700
>> ABBY WAMBACH: Ladies and

01:07.700 --> 01:10.267
gentlemen, Caitlyn Jenner.

01:10.267 --> 01:11.367
(applause, cheering)

01:11.367 --> 01:13.333
*

01:16.733 --> 01:18.333
(Caitlyn exhales)

01:18.333 --> 01:20.733
>> CAITLYN: Kris is coming over.

01:20.733 --> 01:22.367
I have not seen her, talked to

01:22.367 --> 01:25.367
her...

01:25.367 --> 01:27.867
months and months and months.

01:27.867 --> 01:29.833
(knocking)

01:43.200 --> 01:45.167
(birds chirping)

01:47.467 --> 01:49.533
Jen Rade is coming over.

01:49.533 --> 01:50.967
She's the stylist who's gonna

01:50.967 --> 01:53.067
help me dress for the ESPYs.

01:53.067 --> 01:54.433
The bottom line is I really need

01:54.433 --> 01:55.967
a professional to kind of

01:55.967 --> 01:57.167
coordinate everything.

01:57.167 --> 01:59.067
And actually, she does Angelina

01:59.067 --> 02:02.167
Jolie, and I just love her look.

02:02.167 --> 02:05.167
Uh, very casual, very elegant.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.767
She, um...

02:06.767 --> 02:08.367
So, dying to meet her.

02:08.367 --> 02:11.367
(knocking)

02:11.367 --> 02:12.400
Hello there. How are you?

02:12.400 --> 02:13.400
>> JEN: Hi. Oh, my gosh.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.400
>> CAITLYN: Did you bring your

02:14.400 --> 02:14.900
own drink?

02:14.900 --> 02:15.900
>> JEN: Could you be more tall

02:15.900 --> 02:16.567
and gorgeous?

02:16.567 --> 02:17.567
>> CAITLYN: Oh, thank you, baby.

02:17.567 --> 02:18.233
How are you?

02:18.233 --> 02:19.233
Thanks for coming out.

02:19.233 --> 02:20.233
Come on, let's go in the

02:20.233 --> 02:21.233
bedroom, and let's talk first.

02:21.233 --> 02:22.233
>> JEN: That's my favorite

02:22.233 --> 02:23.267
words: Let's go in the bedroom.

02:23.267 --> 02:24.067
>> CAITLYN: Here we go.

02:24.067 --> 02:24.800
Well, here we go for now.

02:24.800 --> 02:25.800
>> JEN: Yes. Oh, my gosh, you

02:25.800 --> 02:26.800
have a great closet.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.900
Every one of these is so pretty.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.333
I mean, I was thinking, like,

02:30.333 --> 02:31.333
oh, my gosh, I want to go

02:31.333 --> 02:32.367
shopping for you, but this is

02:32.367 --> 02:33.067
beautiful.

02:33.067 --> 02:34.067
>> CAITLYN: You like that?

02:34.067 --> 02:35.067
This actually works quite well

02:35.067 --> 02:36.067
with a great belt.

02:36.067 --> 02:36.500
>> JEN: Love.

02:36.500 --> 02:37.500
>> CAITLYN: Fabulous.

02:37.500 --> 02:38.500
>> JEN: And they're all just...

02:38.500 --> 02:39.500
I'm just really getting a sense

02:39.500 --> 02:40.500
of easy classics.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.167
>> CAITLYN: Yes.

02:41.167 --> 02:42.167
>> JEN: Little bit of a hippie

02:42.167 --> 02:43.167
in you.

02:43.167 --> 02:44.167
>> CAITLYN: A little bit, yeah.

02:44.167 --> 02:45.167
More like a little bit, you

02:45.167 --> 02:46.433
know-- product of the '60s and

02:46.433 --> 02:47.433
'70s.

02:47.433 --> 02:48.100
>> JEN: Yeah, I get it.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.100
>> CAITLYN: I've been there.

02:49.100 --> 02:49.600
>> JEN: Uh-huh.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.600
>> CAITLYN: Because I like just

02:50.600 --> 02:51.800
kind of blending in. Um...

02:51.800 --> 02:52.933
>> JEN: Uh, I think it's a

02:52.933 --> 02:53.933
little late for that.

02:53.933 --> 02:54.933
>> CAITLYN: You think so?

02:54.933 --> 02:55.933
>> JEN: Yeah. Just FYI, little

02:55.933 --> 02:56.933
pause-- I think we've, yeah,

02:56.933 --> 02:57.933
we've leaped over that hurdle

02:57.933 --> 02:58.433
already.

02:58.433 --> 02:59.433
>> CAITLYN: Okay, we've passed

02:59.433 --> 03:00.500
that point. Okay.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.600
The big issue I have with the

03:02.600 --> 03:05.400
shoes is...

03:05.400 --> 03:07.600
Okay? That makes me about

03:07.600 --> 03:08.600
six-nine. (laughs)

03:08.600 --> 03:10.733
>> JEN: So?

03:10.733 --> 03:12.067
>> CAITLYN: Now, these...

03:12.067 --> 03:13.133
I don't need any more heel than

03:13.133 --> 03:13.800
that.

03:13.800 --> 03:14.800
>> JEN: That's, like, are you at

03:14.800 --> 03:16.100
max heel for your... for comfort

03:16.100 --> 03:17.100
of height?

03:17.100 --> 03:18.367
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. See how tall I

03:18.367 --> 03:19.467
am?

03:19.467 --> 03:20.600
>> JEN: It feels good.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.633
>> CAITLYN: Let's discuss this.

03:21.633 --> 03:22.300
>> JEN: Okay.

03:22.300 --> 03:23.300
>> CAITLYN: Kind of where we're

03:23.300 --> 03:24.633
at. All right?

03:24.633 --> 03:25.633
>> JEN: Yes.

03:25.633 --> 03:28.067
>> CAITLYN: Um... now, the next

03:28.067 --> 03:31.133
big thing is the ESPN ESPY

03:31.133 --> 03:32.133
Awards.

03:32.133 --> 03:32.800
>> JEN: Yeah.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.067
>> CAITLYN: The ESPYs are held

03:34.067 --> 03:35.200
every year to honor the world's

03:35.200 --> 03:36.533
greatest athletes and other

03:36.533 --> 03:37.900
sports-related achievements.

03:37.900 --> 03:40.100
This year, I'm getting the ESPY

03:40.100 --> 03:43.300
Arthur Ashe Award for Courage.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.867
Uh, I've tried to come up--

03:44.867 --> 03:46.267
we've been going around on

03:46.267 --> 03:48.067
styles, what we want to do, but

03:48.067 --> 03:49.233
all those things have to be

03:49.233 --> 03:50.267
coordinated.

03:50.267 --> 03:52.533
>> JEN: What is your level of,

03:52.533 --> 03:57.200
um... skill walking in heels?

03:57.200 --> 03:58.233
>> CAITLYN: I'm a professional.

03:58.233 --> 03:59.233
>> JEN: Okay. So you're good

03:59.233 --> 03:59.767
with a high heel.

03:59.767 --> 04:00.833
>> CAITLYN: I've been doing it a

04:00.833 --> 04:01.333
long time, girl.

04:01.333 --> 04:02.333
>> JEN (laughs): Okay.

04:02.333 --> 04:03.067
>> CAITLYN: But for something...

04:03.067 --> 04:04.067
>> JEN: I'm terrible, I'm

04:04.067 --> 04:04.567
terrible.

04:04.567 --> 04:05.567
>> CAITLYN: Something like that,

04:05.567 --> 04:06.567
I wouldn't go too high,

04:06.567 --> 04:07.367
something that's too difficult,

04:07.367 --> 04:08.067
'cause you want to be...

04:08.067 --> 04:09.067
>> JEN: Yes. Go on the safe

04:09.067 --> 04:09.733
side.

04:09.733 --> 04:10.733
>> CAITLYN: Yes. On the safe

04:10.733 --> 04:11.233
side, absolutely.

04:11.233 --> 04:12.233
>> JEN: That's a stylist's

04:12.233 --> 04:12.733
nightmare.

04:12.733 --> 04:13.733
>> CAITLYN: My heart will be

04:13.733 --> 04:14.433
pounding no matter what I do.

04:14.433 --> 04:15.433
>> JEN: Yeah. It probably will

04:15.433 --> 04:15.933
be.

04:15.933 --> 04:17.367
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, it will be.

04:17.367 --> 04:18.600
I'm basically going in during

04:18.600 --> 04:19.933
the commercial break, 'cause I'm

04:19.933 --> 04:20.933
not gonna do the red carpet, I'm

04:20.933 --> 04:21.567
not gonna do any of that.

04:21.567 --> 04:22.567
>> JEN: Oh. Okay, that was gonna

04:22.567 --> 04:23.467
be my next question.

04:23.467 --> 04:25.067
>> CAITLYN: Okay, because, uh, I

04:25.067 --> 04:26.333
don't want to be out in the

04:26.333 --> 04:27.367
media where they're asking me

04:27.367 --> 04:28.367
stupid questions.

04:28.367 --> 04:28.867
>> JEN: Yeah.

04:28.867 --> 04:29.867
>> CAITLYN: So basically, I'm

04:29.867 --> 04:31.067
walking out, I'm sitting down.

04:31.067 --> 04:32.300
After the commercial break, we

04:32.300 --> 04:34.433
do... the thing.

04:34.433 --> 04:35.433
I get up, I give my

04:35.433 --> 04:36.767
presentation, and then I go out

04:36.767 --> 04:37.900
the back door and back over to

04:37.900 --> 04:38.900
the hotel.

04:38.900 --> 04:39.400
>> JEN: Right.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.400
>> CAITLYN: Okay? So all they'll

04:40.400 --> 04:42.067
have is that image on stage.

04:42.067 --> 04:43.067
>> JEN: Right, and that'll be

04:43.067 --> 04:44.067
more powerful, it'll go further

04:44.067 --> 04:45.067
because it'll be all they have.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.067
>> CAITLYN: I can control my

04:46.067 --> 04:46.500
message.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.500
>> JEN: Yeah, it'll be all they

04:47.500 --> 04:48.500
have to work with.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.067
It should really just be about

04:50.067 --> 04:51.333
you having fun and doing it for

04:51.333 --> 04:52.333
yourself and not to impress a

04:52.333 --> 04:53.333
bunch of people.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.333
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, yeah.

04:54.333 --> 04:56.067
I have never been in a position

04:56.067 --> 04:58.167
of having a speech, like, at the

04:58.167 --> 05:00.167
ESPYs that's right in front of

05:00.167 --> 05:01.467
all of my peers.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.567
Biggest pressure thing I've ever

05:02.567 --> 05:03.733
done.

05:03.733 --> 05:04.733
>> JEN: Is it? That's the

05:04.733 --> 05:05.733
biggest pressure thing?

05:05.733 --> 05:06.733
>> CAITLYN: Probably. Yes, yes.

05:06.733 --> 05:07.733
After everything I've done in my

05:07.733 --> 05:08.733
life, yeah, this is probably

05:08.733 --> 05:09.933
the... Yeah.

05:09.933 --> 05:11.333
All I got to do is get through

05:11.333 --> 05:13.300
it.

05:21.967 --> 05:22.800
>> RONDA: Hey.

05:22.800 --> 05:23.800
>> COURTNEY: Hi.

05:23.800 --> 05:24.800
>> RONDA: You're out of here

05:24.800 --> 05:25.300
soon?

05:25.300 --> 05:26.300
>> COURTNEY: Yes.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.100
>> RONDA: Aw. Where's-where's

05:28.100 --> 05:29.100
Caitlyn?

05:29.100 --> 05:30.100
>> COURTNEY: I think she's in

05:30.100 --> 05:31.100
the closet.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.067
>> RONDA: Oh. Okay.

05:33.067 --> 05:33.533
Caitlyn.

05:33.533 --> 05:34.533
>> CAITLYN: Yeah?

05:34.533 --> 05:35.533
>> RONDA: We need to fill this

05:35.533 --> 05:36.733
out.

05:36.733 --> 05:37.867
>> CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

05:37.867 --> 05:39.067
This is the club.

05:39.067 --> 05:40.067
How are they gonna feel

05:40.067 --> 05:40.533
about...

05:40.533 --> 05:41.533
>> RONDA: Caitlyn.

05:41.533 --> 05:42.533
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. This name

05:42.533 --> 05:43.533
thing is, like, gonna drive me

05:43.533 --> 05:44.200
crazy.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.200
>> RONDA: No, I know.

05:45.200 --> 05:45.733
>> CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

05:45.733 --> 05:46.533
>> RONDA: All right, so

05:46.533 --> 05:47.233
you're... it's Bruce.

05:47.233 --> 05:48.233
>> CAITLYN: One place you're

05:48.233 --> 05:49.233
Bruce, the other place you're

05:49.233 --> 05:50.233
Caitlyn.

05:50.233 --> 05:52.067
>> RONDA: (laughs) What are we

05:52.067 --> 05:53.400
gonna do about your locker room?

05:53.400 --> 05:54.633
>> CAITLYN: Could it be any more

05:54.633 --> 05:56.567
complicated?!

05:56.567 --> 05:58.500
No. That's Sherwood-- we're

05:58.500 --> 06:00.067
still doing the old Bruce thing.

06:00.067 --> 06:01.067
>> RONDA: But I don't understand

06:01.067 --> 06:03.100
why you're putting "Bruce" down

06:03.100 --> 06:05.267
as opposed to "Caitlyn."

06:05.267 --> 06:06.367
I mean, really?

06:06.367 --> 06:07.367
>> CAITLYN: My membership is

06:07.367 --> 06:08.367
under "Bruce."

06:08.367 --> 06:10.900
My little Sherwood is down for

06:10.900 --> 06:12.733
construction on the golf course,

06:12.733 --> 06:14.233
and it'll be down for a long

06:14.233 --> 06:17.267
time, and there is another golf

06:17.267 --> 06:18.667
course at Sherwood-- a par three

06:18.667 --> 06:19.967
course, actually-- but you

06:19.967 --> 06:21.633
have... have to join that one.

06:21.633 --> 06:22.800
It's, like, separate from the

06:22.800 --> 06:23.467
main club.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.967
>> RONDA: Why can't you go in

06:24.967 --> 06:26.500
fresh as Caitlyn?

06:26.500 --> 06:27.567
>> CAITLYN: Because it's just

06:27.567 --> 06:28.333
not gonna work.

06:28.333 --> 06:29.833
>> RONDA: What are you gonna do,

06:29.833 --> 06:31.333
wear your... wear your hoodie

06:31.333 --> 06:32.367
and pretend it's not...

06:32.367 --> 06:33.267
>> CAITLYN: Probably. Yeah.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.833
And then once I get out on the

06:34.833 --> 06:35.933
course, I'll take that off.

06:35.933 --> 06:37.100
>> RONDA: Are you gonna wear a

06:37.100 --> 06:38.100
skirt or shorts, or are you...

06:38.100 --> 06:39.933
>> CAITLYN: No, no, no, no, no.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.600
Not right now-- I just-just want

06:41.600 --> 06:42.800
to get in to do the thing.

06:42.800 --> 06:43.467
>> JEN: Okay.

06:43.467 --> 06:44.467
>> CAITLYN: So let's just put

06:44.467 --> 06:45.300
"Bruce" down. It's fine.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.200
>> RONDA: All right, I'm just

06:46.200 --> 06:47.200
saying it doesn't make any sense

06:47.200 --> 06:48.200
to me, 'cause everyone's gonna

06:48.200 --> 06:48.933
know that you're Caitlyn and

06:48.933 --> 06:49.933
then it's gonna be more

06:49.933 --> 06:50.433
confusing.

06:50.433 --> 06:51.433
>> CAITLYN: I don't have to

06:51.433 --> 06:52.500
worry about locker rooms and all

06:52.500 --> 06:53.500
that crap right now, which I

06:53.500 --> 06:54.500
don't want to worry about.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.833
I'll worry about the locker

06:55.833 --> 06:56.833
rooms later on down the line.

06:56.833 --> 06:57.833
>> RONDA: I-I understand, but

06:57.833 --> 06:58.833
everyone's going to know that

06:58.833 --> 06:59.367
you're Caitlyn.

06:59.367 --> 07:00.433
>> CAITLYN: I know, I know, I

07:00.433 --> 07:00.933
know, but...

07:00.933 --> 07:01.933
>> RONDA: And then they're gonna

07:01.933 --> 07:02.667
be like, "Well, I don't want

07:02.667 --> 07:03.500
Caitlyn in my locker room."

07:03.500 --> 07:04.333
>> CAITLYN: I know, I know, I

07:04.333 --> 07:04.967
know.

07:04.967 --> 07:05.833
Well, that... we'll deal with

07:05.833 --> 07:07.933
all those issues down the way.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.933
I'm joining a... We have a par

07:16.933 --> 07:17.933
three course at the club.

07:17.933 --> 07:18.933
>> CANDIS: Right.

07:18.933 --> 07:19.933
>> CAITLYN: And so I'm getting

07:19.933 --> 07:21.333
ready to sign the little

07:21.333 --> 07:22.600
application, since the big

07:22.600 --> 07:23.867
course is gonna be down for nine

07:23.867 --> 07:24.533
months.

07:24.533 --> 07:27.067
Uh, so I go and join... I don't

07:27.067 --> 07:29.633
know what to say.

07:29.633 --> 07:31.600
How do I write my name?

07:31.600 --> 07:32.600
>> CANDIS: What do you mean, how

07:32.600 --> 07:34.400
do you write your name?

07:34.400 --> 07:36.333
>> CAITLYN: Is it Bruce?

07:36.333 --> 07:37.367
>> CANDIS: Well, you...

07:37.367 --> 07:38.833
It's Caitlyn.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.100
>> CAITLYN: Well, I know that,

07:40.100 --> 07:42.067
but, uh, to the club, it's a

07:42.067 --> 07:44.433
different deal.

07:44.433 --> 07:45.933
When it comes to the club,

07:45.933 --> 07:47.600
honestly, it's not easy for me,

07:47.600 --> 07:48.767
okay?

07:48.767 --> 07:50.100
These are all the people-- I was

07:50.100 --> 07:51.633
there basically every day.

07:51.633 --> 07:53.233
It's a very conservative club,

07:53.233 --> 07:54.733
so I have no idea how the

07:54.733 --> 07:56.233
members are feeling towards my

07:56.233 --> 07:57.267
issue.

07:57.267 --> 07:58.267
What are they gonna do with my

07:58.267 --> 07:58.767
locker?

07:58.767 --> 07:59.767
Is it going upstairs to the

07:59.767 --> 08:00.467
ladies' locker room?

08:00.467 --> 08:01.800
>> CANDIS: Well, it's going to.

08:01.800 --> 08:02.567
It has to.

08:02.567 --> 08:03.433
>> CAITLYN: But I'm wondering--

08:03.433 --> 08:04.733
I know-- but I'm wondering,

08:04.733 --> 08:06.267
like, these older ladies that,

08:06.267 --> 08:08.667
you know, in their 70s and 80s,

08:08.667 --> 08:11.233
going, "Uh... why is he in

08:11.233 --> 08:12.233
here?"

08:12.233 --> 08:13.833
>> CANDIS: Our transitions

08:13.833 --> 08:14.867
affect different people in

08:14.867 --> 08:16.700
different ways, and it's not

08:16.700 --> 08:18.433
about what they think, it's

08:18.433 --> 08:19.667
about how you feel, because

08:19.667 --> 08:20.900
you're living your life.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.067
They'll get over it.

08:22.067 --> 08:23.600
You can't play both sides of the

08:23.600 --> 08:24.767
fence anymore.

08:24.767 --> 08:26.167
You're way beyond that.

08:26.167 --> 08:28.367
Come on.

08:28.367 --> 08:30.667
There's no excuse-- just sign

08:30.667 --> 08:32.367
your name as Caitlyn from now on

08:32.367 --> 08:34.567
and move on.

08:41.067 --> 08:42.067
>> CANDIS: Come on, honey!

08:42.067 --> 08:43.067
>> CAITLYN: A new day, a new

08:43.067 --> 08:43.500
adventure.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.567
>> CANDIS (laughs): Yes.

08:44.567 --> 08:45.567
>> CAITLYN: We get to see Chandi

08:45.567 --> 08:46.300
today.

08:46.300 --> 08:47.067
>> CANDIS: I know.

08:47.067 --> 08:47.767
>> CAITLYN: That's good.

08:47.767 --> 08:49.067
Chandi has a program at

08:49.067 --> 08:49.933
Children's Hospital called

08:49.933 --> 08:51.200
Blush.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.400
They help gender-nonconforming

08:52.400 --> 08:53.567
youth.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.600
>> CHANDI: Hi!

08:54.600 --> 08:55.933
>> CAITLYN: I'm so excited to

08:55.933 --> 08:57.600
meet this group of kids that she

08:57.600 --> 08:58.767
works with.

08:58.767 --> 09:00.133
>> CHANDI: We do get into heavy

09:00.133 --> 09:01.367
discussions, you know.

09:01.367 --> 09:02.833
We lay it all on the line.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.967
'Cause that's the only way

09:03.967 --> 09:04.967
they'll work it out.

09:04.967 --> 09:05.967
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. I like that.

09:05.967 --> 09:06.967
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

09:06.967 --> 09:07.967
>> CAITLYN: Let's go meet them.

09:07.967 --> 09:08.967
>> CHANDI: Let's go.

09:08.967 --> 09:11.067
In our support group, we talk

09:11.067 --> 09:12.833
about all the different

09:12.833 --> 09:14.467
struggles, um, that they go

09:14.467 --> 09:16.133
through, and we make sure that

09:16.133 --> 09:17.567
they're doing the things that

09:17.567 --> 09:19.167
they need to do to get

09:19.167 --> 09:21.367
themselves to the next level.

09:21.367 --> 09:22.667
Some of them need that love,

09:22.667 --> 09:24.367
because the love that they've

09:24.367 --> 09:27.133
received at home wasn't any.

09:27.133 --> 09:30.267
It was, "Get out."

09:30.267 --> 09:31.800
Let's welcome our special guest.

09:31.800 --> 09:32.800
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God, there's

09:32.800 --> 09:33.800
that many?

09:33.800 --> 09:35.200
(laughter, applause)

09:35.200 --> 09:36.567
Hello, everybody!

09:36.567 --> 09:38.133
(whooping)

09:38.133 --> 09:41.067
Look at this group.

09:41.067 --> 09:44.600
I just have to say one thing.

09:44.600 --> 09:45.800
I love Chandi.

09:45.800 --> 09:46.800
>> CHANDI: Oh.

09:46.800 --> 09:47.800
(laughter)

09:47.800 --> 09:49.400
>> WOMAN: So do we.

09:49.400 --> 09:50.833
>> CAITLYN: She has taught me so

09:50.833 --> 09:53.067
much, and so you're very lucky

09:53.067 --> 09:54.933
to have her in your life.

09:54.933 --> 09:56.233
>> WOMAN: Yeah.

09:56.233 --> 09:57.467
>> CHANDI: Thank you.

09:57.467 --> 09:58.500
>> CAITLYN: Where do you go from

09:58.500 --> 09:59.200
there, right?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.200
>> CHANDI: Yeah, where do you

10:00.200 --> 10:01.667
go, where do you go?

10:01.667 --> 10:02.867
I guess what we're gonna get

10:02.867 --> 10:05.367
started talking about is: who

10:05.367 --> 10:07.500
in the group has had their names

10:07.500 --> 10:10.133
changed, and how was that

10:10.133 --> 10:11.367
process for you?

10:11.367 --> 10:12.533
>> SAM: For the papers to be

10:12.533 --> 10:13.767
filed, it took me, like, two

10:13.767 --> 10:15.333
weeks here, and then to wait for

10:15.333 --> 10:17.067
a court date, it can take them,

10:17.067 --> 10:18.667
like, a year, year and a half.

10:18.667 --> 10:19.700
Some people are still waiting.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.267
>> CHANDI: So how has it been

10:21.267 --> 10:23.233
for those of you who have your

10:23.233 --> 10:25.700
I.D. not matching who you are?

10:25.700 --> 10:26.700
Jessica?

10:26.700 --> 10:28.033
>> JESSICA: With volunteering

10:28.033 --> 10:29.500
and working, sometimes it can

10:29.500 --> 10:30.500
get a little bit intimidating.

10:30.500 --> 10:31.600
Do you put your legal name on

10:31.600 --> 10:32.600
the application, and then

10:32.600 --> 10:33.733
they're expecting something

10:33.733 --> 10:35.067
else.

10:35.067 --> 10:37.100
They see "Jason," but then they

10:37.100 --> 10:38.900
see "Jessica."

10:38.900 --> 10:40.467
It's like, "What?"

10:40.467 --> 10:42.100
So they don't really understand.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.433
>> CHANDI: Okay. There are still

10:43.433 --> 10:45.900
many obstacles in our community

10:45.900 --> 10:48.333
with having your I.D. match your

10:48.333 --> 10:49.867
authentic self.

10:49.867 --> 10:51.200
Luckily there have been some

10:51.200 --> 10:53.133
laws that have passed recently

10:53.133 --> 10:55.267
that allow less paperwork, but

10:55.267 --> 10:57.133
getting a court date, it's,

10:57.133 --> 10:58.133
like, a year.

10:58.133 --> 10:59.567
So it kind of makes that

10:59.567 --> 11:02.067
situation a little harder.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.767
So what about your I.D. not

11:03.767 --> 11:05.767
matching at the time of traffic

11:05.767 --> 11:06.767
stops?

11:06.767 --> 11:08.067
I'm sure we have plenty of

11:08.067 --> 11:09.533
stories about that one.

11:09.533 --> 11:11.167
>> ETHAN: When I interact with

11:11.167 --> 11:12.433
the police, they're-they're

11:12.433 --> 11:15.400
pretty cool to me all the way up

11:15.400 --> 11:17.967
until they ask me my legal name,

11:17.967 --> 11:19.067
'cause I haven't gotten that

11:19.067 --> 11:20.167
changed yet.

11:20.167 --> 11:22.267
And then, all of a sudden, they

11:22.267 --> 11:24.067
just keep calling me "ma'am."

11:24.067 --> 11:25.800
Like, "Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am,

11:25.800 --> 11:26.800
miss, ma'am."

11:26.800 --> 11:29.333
Like, do I look like a ma'am?

11:29.333 --> 11:31.533
And then I get all those

11:31.533 --> 11:33.100
messed-up questions.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.233
Like, you don't need to know

11:34.233 --> 11:35.667
what-what I have underneath my

11:35.667 --> 11:37.400
clothes.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.433
>> CINIA: Similar to that, I met

11:38.433 --> 11:39.800
this guy and he ended up

11:39.800 --> 11:40.800
getting stopped because he had a

11:40.800 --> 11:43.200
car and, um, his license-- he

11:43.200 --> 11:44.500
had the paper license, so they

11:44.500 --> 11:45.500
stopped him.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.333
And then they asked me for my

11:47.333 --> 11:48.367
I.D.

11:48.367 --> 11:49.367
And then it was like, "Oh,

11:49.367 --> 11:50.867
she's a (bleep)."

11:50.867 --> 11:52.633
You know, it stopped being about

11:52.633 --> 11:53.667
the traffic thing and then it

11:53.667 --> 11:54.767
turned... all-all their

11:54.767 --> 11:55.900
attention turned to me.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.333
They were laughing, they asked

11:57.333 --> 11:58.333
me, like, how much did my

11:58.333 --> 11:59.600
implants cost, how much did my

11:59.600 --> 12:00.667
wig cost, do I still have my

12:00.667 --> 12:01.667
(bleep).

12:01.667 --> 12:02.667
>> WOMAN: Did you put a

12:02.667 --> 12:04.233
complaint, sweetheart, on that?

12:04.233 --> 12:05.300
'Cause you know you could.

12:05.300 --> 12:06.500
Totally.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.533
>> CINIA: Actually, I did, but

12:07.533 --> 12:10.300
it never went anywhere.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.400
>> MAN: I don't know about

12:11.400 --> 12:12.400
everybody, but for me it's very

12:12.400 --> 12:13.400
difficult.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.600
Um, some people are very cruel,

12:15.600 --> 12:17.067
not accepting.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.067
Some people look at me as a

12:18.067 --> 12:19.067
human.

12:19.067 --> 12:20.367
And then some other people look

12:20.367 --> 12:22.967
at me as an animal.

12:22.967 --> 12:24.133
>> CAITLYN: Thank you for your

12:24.133 --> 12:25.267
openness.

12:25.267 --> 12:28.067
Um, uh, it's... it's extremely

12:28.067 --> 12:30.467
important that we're heard.

12:30.467 --> 12:31.733
We're heard.

12:31.733 --> 12:33.133
And that's what it's all about,

12:33.133 --> 12:34.133
you know?

12:34.133 --> 12:36.600
That we're just part of society.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.533
We're people.

12:38.533 --> 12:41.633
It makes me so sad to see what

12:41.633 --> 12:44.300
these kids have gone through.

12:44.300 --> 12:46.667
Um, been harassed by police or

12:46.667 --> 12:48.433
not just being able to get a job

12:48.433 --> 12:49.700
that they want because their

12:49.700 --> 12:50.700
I.D. doesn't match who they

12:50.700 --> 12:51.700
really are.

12:51.700 --> 12:53.333
This really puts my personal

12:53.333 --> 12:55.767
challenges into perspective.

12:55.767 --> 12:57.533
I want to learn from that, so we

12:57.533 --> 12:59.233
can change things in the future.

12:59.233 --> 13:01.500
I hope I can use my life and my

13:01.500 --> 13:03.600
resources to make it easier on

13:03.600 --> 13:05.533
the next generation.

13:05.533 --> 13:06.600
>> HOLLY: I just want to say

13:06.600 --> 13:07.700
thank you so much for the work

13:07.700 --> 13:08.700
that you're doing.

13:08.700 --> 13:09.800
You know, it's reaching a lot of

13:09.800 --> 13:11.633
people and I never thought, in a

13:11.633 --> 13:13.167
million years, that my father

13:13.167 --> 13:14.900
would, uh, reach out to me.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.867
And he sent me an e-mail a few

13:16.867 --> 13:18.700
days ago, and he wants to... he

13:18.700 --> 13:20.267
told me he wants to get to know

13:20.267 --> 13:21.333
me as Holly.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.933
And that's such a big deal to

13:22.933 --> 13:25.933
me, so thank you so much.

13:25.933 --> 13:27.867
I never thought it would happen.

13:27.867 --> 13:28.867
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

13:28.867 --> 13:30.800
That means so much to me.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.667
>> CHANDI: You know, you are the

13:32.667 --> 13:36.600
future, you are the example, and

13:36.600 --> 13:38.567
you being in that position, you

13:38.567 --> 13:40.267
need to be showing others the

13:40.267 --> 13:41.700
journey that they could have.

13:41.700 --> 13:42.700
>> CAITLYN: And thank you for

13:42.700 --> 13:43.700
your time.

13:43.700 --> 13:44.700
>> CHANDI: Yeah.

13:44.700 --> 13:45.300
>> CAITLYN: I certainly

13:45.300 --> 13:46.300
appreciate it.

13:46.300 --> 13:47.333
>> CHANDI: And we say thank you

13:47.333 --> 13:48.500
for everybody coming to group

13:48.500 --> 13:50.067
being on time today.

13:50.067 --> 13:51.267
>> CAITLYN: Yay!

13:51.267 --> 13:53.233
(applause)

14:01.767 --> 14:04.467
My speech for the ESPYs-- I

14:04.467 --> 14:05.967
really know, pretty much, what I

14:05.967 --> 14:06.967
want to say.

14:06.967 --> 14:07.967
>> RONDA: Like, it's five

14:07.967 --> 14:08.967
minutes, right?

14:08.967 --> 14:09.967
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, it's five to

14:09.967 --> 14:10.467
six minutes, yeah.

14:10.467 --> 14:11.967
>> RONDA: Do you want to read it

14:11.967 --> 14:12.967
out loud?

14:12.967 --> 14:14.300
>> CAITLYN: I don't know, but

14:14.300 --> 14:15.467
I've had enough.

14:15.467 --> 14:17.367
>> RONDA: Oh, my God, the drama.

14:17.367 --> 14:18.367
(laughs)

14:18.367 --> 14:19.367
>> CAITLYN: I'll just hand it

14:19.367 --> 14:20.100
off to you.

14:20.100 --> 14:20.867
You got this.

14:20.867 --> 14:21.867
>> RONDA: I'm here to help you.

14:21.867 --> 14:22.867
>> CAITLYN: To coach me through

14:22.867 --> 14:23.600
this.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.367
>> RONDA: I'll help you.

14:24.367 --> 14:25.367
>> CAITLYN: I have to

14:25.367 --> 14:26.367
practically memorize that

14:26.367 --> 14:27.367
speech.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.600
For me, it's never been easy on

14:28.600 --> 14:29.600
a teleprompter.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.600
I was a dyslexic kid-- my

14:30.600 --> 14:31.733
biggest fear in life was to go

14:31.733 --> 14:32.733
to school, 'cause I was afraid I

14:32.733 --> 14:33.733
was gonna have to read in front

14:33.733 --> 14:34.733
of the class.

14:34.733 --> 14:35.767
But I've got such a short amount

14:35.767 --> 14:36.767
of time to get it right.

14:36.767 --> 14:37.767
I've got to stick to the

14:37.767 --> 14:38.767
teleprompter.

14:38.767 --> 14:41.133
I just have to do it.

14:41.133 --> 14:43.100
Oh, God.

14:46.067 --> 14:47.067
>> ABBY WAMBACH: Ladies and

14:47.067 --> 14:49.467
gentlemen, Caitlyn Jenner.

14:49.467 --> 14:51.133
>> CAITLYN: I'm standing there

14:51.133 --> 14:52.800
in front of my peers.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.567
I feel so unbelievably

14:55.567 --> 14:57.433
vulnerable.

14:57.433 --> 14:58.433
>> JENNY: Hello?

14:58.433 --> 14:59.833
>> CAITLYN: Kris is coming over

14:59.833 --> 15:01.500
in, like, a half hour.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.667
>> JENNY: How do you feel?

15:02.667 --> 15:03.900
>> CAITLYN: Uh, a lot of

15:03.900 --> 15:05.067
anxiety.

15:05.067 --> 15:06.967
(knocking)

15:14.867 --> 15:17.733
(line ringing)

15:17.733 --> 15:19.267
>> PAM: Hey.

15:19.267 --> 15:21.200
>> CAITLYN: Hey, there you are.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.067
>> PAM: Yeah, I just got off the

15:23.067 --> 15:24.133
golf course.

15:24.133 --> 15:25.667
>> CAITLYN: Tough life, sis.

15:25.667 --> 15:28.433
Uh, did you talk to Mom today?

15:28.433 --> 15:30.067
>> PAM: Uh, this morning, yes.

15:30.067 --> 15:31.800
>> CAITLYN: I talked to her.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.400
She still thinks she can make it

15:33.400 --> 15:34.800
to the ESPYs.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.533
Break her hip and still come

15:36.533 --> 15:38.900
down here.

15:38.900 --> 15:41.067
What an ornery old girl.

15:41.067 --> 15:41.800
>> PAM: She is.

15:41.800 --> 15:42.500
>> RONDA: She is.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.400
She's a tough... she's a tough

15:43.400 --> 15:44.133
cookie.

15:44.133 --> 15:45.200
>> CAITLYN: She really is, yeah.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.400
Little fighter.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.667
Of course, right here, before

15:47.667 --> 15:49.433
the ESPYs, my mother breaks her

15:49.433 --> 15:50.667
hip.

15:50.667 --> 15:52.833
One problem after the next.

15:52.833 --> 15:54.733
If she can't make it, it would

15:54.733 --> 15:56.967
be devastating, because she's

15:56.967 --> 15:58.667
obviously been very important in

15:58.667 --> 16:00.067
my life.

16:00.067 --> 16:01.500
And I wouldn't be here if it

16:01.500 --> 16:02.833
wasn't for her.

16:02.833 --> 16:04.200
>> PAM: We'll know more today,

16:04.200 --> 16:05.967
because she's going into a rehab

16:05.967 --> 16:07.133
facility.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.300
>> CAITLYN: She's coming down...

16:08.300 --> 16:09.467
I'm just, you know, wondering if

16:09.467 --> 16:11.067
she's gonna make it or what.

16:11.067 --> 16:12.500
>> PAM: I know, I know.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.933
She really wants to go.

16:13.933 --> 16:15.900
>> CAITLYN: I know, I know.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.667
>> DRIAN: Hi! How are you?

16:29.667 --> 16:30.667
>> CAITLYN: Hello!

16:30.667 --> 16:31.833
You made it.

16:31.833 --> 16:32.833
Do you look so nice, babe?

16:32.833 --> 16:33.833
>> DRIAN: You look gorgeous.

16:33.833 --> 16:34.833
>> CAITLYN: Oh, same to you.

16:34.833 --> 16:35.600
How are you?

16:35.600 --> 16:36.233
>> DRIAN: Good, thank you.

16:36.233 --> 16:36.833
How are you?

16:36.833 --> 16:37.833
>> CAITLYN: Good to see you.

16:37.833 --> 16:38.433
Good to see you.

16:38.433 --> 16:40.067
>> DRIAN: Great to see you.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.133
>> CAITLYN: Have a seat.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.267
So, the big one.

16:42.267 --> 16:43.267
Name change.

16:43.267 --> 16:44.267
>> DRIAN: Oh, yeah.

16:44.267 --> 16:45.267
>> RONDA: Yes, and...

16:45.267 --> 16:46.267
>> DRIAN: Name and gender

16:46.267 --> 16:46.767
change.

16:46.767 --> 16:47.767
>> CAITLYN: Name and gender

16:47.767 --> 16:48.267
change.

16:48.267 --> 16:49.533
>> RONDA: And I'm, like...

16:49.533 --> 16:51.100
very confused about the whole

16:51.100 --> 16:52.800
thing, and I have no idea where

16:52.800 --> 16:54.333
to start, what to do, but we

16:54.333 --> 16:55.333
need to get the ball rolling.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.333
>> DRIAN: Yes.

16:56.333 --> 16:57.333
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

16:57.333 --> 16:58.267
>> DRIAN: You know, you have to

16:58.267 --> 16:59.333
go through the court-ordered

16:59.333 --> 17:00.333
process, which has been

17:00.333 --> 17:01.467
streamlined a bit.

17:01.467 --> 17:04.133
Before, uh, you had to have

17:04.133 --> 17:05.367
gender confirmation surgery

17:05.367 --> 17:07.100
before you could change your

17:07.100 --> 17:08.267
gender marker.

17:08.267 --> 17:10.333
Um, there was advocacy done to

17:10.333 --> 17:11.733
change that, and now you just

17:11.733 --> 17:13.067
have to have clinically

17:13.067 --> 17:14.367
appropriate treatment to change

17:14.367 --> 17:15.367
your gender marker.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.367
>> RONDA: Now, are you speaking

17:16.367 --> 17:17.367
just for California, or for most

17:17.367 --> 17:18.167
of the United States?

17:18.167 --> 17:18.967
>> DRIAN: This is just

17:18.967 --> 17:19.967
California.

17:19.967 --> 17:20.633
>> RONDA: Wow.

17:20.633 --> 17:21.500
>> DRIAN: Each state has its own

17:21.500 --> 17:22.233
regulations.

17:22.233 --> 17:23.067
>> CAITLYN: Which is something,

17:23.067 --> 17:23.867
I think, in the future, we

17:23.867 --> 17:24.667
should all work on and try and

17:24.667 --> 17:25.400
get changed.

17:25.400 --> 17:26.400
>> DRIAN: It should just be the

17:26.400 --> 17:27.167
same across the board.

17:27.167 --> 17:28.067
>> CAITLYN: So we're in the

17:28.067 --> 17:28.767
right state?

17:28.767 --> 17:29.667
>> DRIAN: We're in the right

17:29.667 --> 17:31.333
state-- this is one of the best

17:31.333 --> 17:32.633
states to be in for transgender

17:32.633 --> 17:33.600
people.

17:33.600 --> 17:34.667
There's lots of protection.

17:34.667 --> 17:35.667
>> CAITLYN: After hearing all

17:35.667 --> 17:37.067
the struggles that people go

17:37.067 --> 17:38.433
through because they don't have

17:38.433 --> 17:40.067
the proper documentation, I

17:40.067 --> 17:41.300
realize that I should be a

17:41.300 --> 17:43.067
little bit more aggressive in

17:43.067 --> 17:43.967
dealing with this issue of my

17:43.967 --> 17:44.867
identity.

17:44.867 --> 17:46.500
I think it's time to get that

17:46.500 --> 17:47.567
process started.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.800
>> DRIAN: I brought the forms to

17:48.800 --> 17:50.067
go over them, to sort of explain

17:50.067 --> 17:51.300
to you what the forms are.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.300
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

17:52.300 --> 17:53.300
>> DRIAN: There's about a dozen

17:53.300 --> 17:54.967
of them-- in total, it's about

17:54.967 --> 17:56.800
18 forms, 'cause some of them

17:56.800 --> 17:58.333
have a couple of pages.

17:58.333 --> 17:59.333
>> RONDA: It seems kind of fun.

17:59.333 --> 18:00.200
>> DRIAN: Yeah.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.067
>> RONDA: I mean, to me.

18:01.067 --> 18:02.067
It's, like, it's kind of

18:02.067 --> 18:02.700
exciting.

18:02.700 --> 18:03.500
>> DRIAN: Oh, yeah.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.733
Um, I brought you an overview

18:05.733 --> 18:07.933
of, uh, what it means to change

18:07.933 --> 18:09.767
your, uh, identity through the

18:09.767 --> 18:11.767
court and then what the process

18:11.767 --> 18:13.067
is for changing all of

18:13.067 --> 18:14.133
your I.D.s.

18:14.133 --> 18:15.300
>> CAITLYN: Um, what does it

18:15.300 --> 18:16.300
mean?

18:16.300 --> 18:18.200
>> DRIAN: So it... Okay.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.533
It means that the court is now

18:19.533 --> 18:21.333
legally recognizing you in your

18:21.333 --> 18:23.067
new identity and that that is

18:23.067 --> 18:24.233
your identity in all states.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.467
Once that's done, you can go in

18:25.467 --> 18:26.333
and pick up your decree.

18:26.333 --> 18:27.500
Then you go to the Social

18:27.500 --> 18:28.233
Security office.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.067
>> CAITLYN: That's the golden

18:29.067 --> 18:29.733
ticket.

18:29.733 --> 18:30.600
>> DRIAN: That's the golden

18:30.600 --> 18:31.467
ticket right there.

18:31.467 --> 18:32.300
>> CAITLYN: Baby, right there,

18:32.300 --> 18:33.200
that's what we're looking for.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.100
>> DRIAN: Okay? That's the

18:34.100 --> 18:35.267
golden ticket.

18:35.267 --> 18:37.133
When I finally was able to do my

18:37.133 --> 18:38.167
court-ordered name and gender

18:38.167 --> 18:39.167
change, it was like a birthday,

18:39.167 --> 18:40.067
you know.

18:40.067 --> 18:41.067
It was like, "Woo-hoo, I'm

18:41.067 --> 18:41.867
born!"

18:41.867 --> 18:43.067
Like, yay, I'm finally here.

18:43.067 --> 18:44.833
This is me. Like, look.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.167
I was happy; I wanted to show my

18:46.167 --> 18:47.567
I.D. to everyone.

18:47.567 --> 18:49.233
Up until then, it felt like a

18:49.233 --> 18:51.100
lie for so many of us.

18:51.100 --> 18:52.100
You're ready.

18:52.100 --> 18:52.600
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

18:52.600 --> 18:53.600
Yeah, we'll start the process.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.367
>> DRIAN: Yay, I'm so happy.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.367
>> CAITLYN: All right, and thank

18:55.367 --> 18:56.067
you for bringing these out.

18:56.067 --> 18:57.067
We'll get them filled out and

18:57.067 --> 18:57.600
get them back to you.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.700
>> DRIAN: Yes, let's do it.

18:58.700 --> 18:59.700
>> RONDA: Yeah, no, I think this

18:59.700 --> 19:00.500
is gonna be fun.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.267
>> CAITLYN: I know. I know.

19:01.267 --> 19:02.067
>> DRIAN: It's gonna be fun.

19:02.067 --> 19:03.067
It's gonna be really, really

19:03.067 --> 19:03.700
fun.

19:03.700 --> 19:05.667
>> CAITLYN: I know.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.167
(knocking)

19:12.167 --> 19:13.167
>> CAITLYN: Have you guys been

19:13.167 --> 19:13.967
waiting long?

19:13.967 --> 19:14.700
>> PAM: Yes.

19:14.700 --> 19:15.633
>> ESTHER: Have we been waiting?

19:15.633 --> 19:16.433
>> CAITLYN: Come on in.

19:16.433 --> 19:17.433
>> PAM: Watch your fingers.

19:17.433 --> 19:18.133
>> CAITLYN: There we go, there

19:18.133 --> 19:19.133
we go, there we go.

19:19.133 --> 19:19.800
>> ESTHER: Hey!

19:19.800 --> 19:20.633
>> CAITLYN: Aw, yay!

19:20.633 --> 19:21.633
>> ESTHER: I don't believe I got

19:21.633 --> 19:22.633
here.

19:22.633 --> 19:23.967
>> CAITLYN: You made it, Mom!

19:23.967 --> 19:24.633
Lisa's back.

19:24.633 --> 19:25.333
>> LISA: How you doing?

19:25.333 --> 19:26.333
>> CAITLYN: Samantha's here for

19:26.333 --> 19:27.133
the first time.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.167
>> SAMANTHA: I know.

19:28.167 --> 19:28.967
It's beautiful here.

19:28.967 --> 19:30.333
>> CAITLYN: I know. It is nice.

19:30.333 --> 19:31.300
Come on in.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.100
>> PAM: Hello.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.567
>> CAITLYN: Good.

19:33.567 --> 19:34.733
>> PAM: Last time, I was quite

19:34.733 --> 19:35.767
apprehensive.

19:35.767 --> 19:37.733
I know we were curious.

19:37.733 --> 19:39.633
>> ESTHER: There you are.

19:39.633 --> 19:42.233
>> CAITLYN: Now, everybody, it's

19:42.233 --> 19:43.400
okay.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.767
>> PAM: I thought you were gonna

19:44.767 --> 19:45.900
look more like me.

19:45.900 --> 19:48.333
(laughter)

19:48.333 --> 19:50.133
>> CAITLYN: Oh, sister.

19:50.133 --> 19:52.500
>> PAM: I have been s... always

19:52.500 --> 19:54.333
so very proud of my brother

19:54.333 --> 19:55.400
Bruce.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.467
But I can't tell you, uh, how

19:57.467 --> 19:59.700
proud I am now of my sister

19:59.700 --> 20:02.167
Caitlyn-- even more so.

20:02.167 --> 20:03.467
Even more so.

20:03.467 --> 20:04.467
>> CAITLYN: Come on, sisses.

20:04.467 --> 20:05.467
>> PAM: All right.

20:05.467 --> 20:07.300
Ooh-hoo.

20:07.300 --> 20:08.900
>> LISA: This life that you've

20:08.900 --> 20:11.467
had is just so extraordinary,

20:11.467 --> 20:12.833
you know?

20:12.833 --> 20:14.233
It really is, you know?

20:14.233 --> 20:15.433
That you-you went and

20:15.433 --> 20:17.067
accomplished that goal, and then

20:17.067 --> 20:18.400
now, um, the things that

20:18.400 --> 20:19.400
you're doing.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.400
And this is so much bigger, I

20:20.400 --> 20:21.067
think.

20:21.067 --> 20:22.100
>> CAITLYN: It's so much bigger.

20:22.100 --> 20:22.900
>> LISA: It is.

20:22.900 --> 20:23.900
>> CAITLYN: People die over this

20:23.900 --> 20:24.900
issue.

20:24.900 --> 20:25.900
Nobody was dying over the Games.

20:25.900 --> 20:26.900
>> LISA: No.

20:26.900 --> 20:27.900
>> CAITLYN: It was just the

20:27.900 --> 20:28.900
Games.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.433
This is a serious issue that

20:30.433 --> 20:32.233
affects a lot of people, a lot

20:32.233 --> 20:33.867
more than you think.

20:33.867 --> 20:34.867
>> PAM: Well, how is it gonna

20:34.867 --> 20:36.500
feel tomorrow night among...

20:36.500 --> 20:37.500
"your peers"?

20:37.500 --> 20:38.333
>> CAITLYN: My peers?

20:38.333 --> 20:39.100
>> PAM: Other athletes.

20:39.100 --> 20:40.100
>> CAITLYN: I think it'll be

20:40.100 --> 20:41.100
very good.

20:41.100 --> 20:42.767
Um, it's a tough place to have

20:42.767 --> 20:43.767
your first public appearance, to

20:43.767 --> 20:44.767
say the least.

20:44.767 --> 20:45.767
>> PAM: I would think so.

20:45.767 --> 20:46.767
>> CAITLYN: Let's just go right

20:46.767 --> 20:48.667
out in front of your peers and

20:48.667 --> 20:51.633
your friends and people I know

20:51.633 --> 20:53.233
and stand up there and tell your

20:53.233 --> 20:54.233
story.

20:54.233 --> 20:55.233
>> LISA: Are you getting

20:55.233 --> 20:57.700
nervous?

20:57.700 --> 20:58.767
>> CAITLYN: I feel so much

20:58.767 --> 21:00.633
pressure giving this speech,

21:00.633 --> 21:02.700
on a subject that I know very

21:02.700 --> 21:05.867
well, but have never, ever

21:05.867 --> 21:07.667
talked about it in public.

21:07.667 --> 21:08.667
>> CHANDI: How's the speech

21:08.667 --> 21:11.433
coming along?

21:11.433 --> 21:12.933
Oh.

21:12.933 --> 21:14.100
>> CANDIS: How long is it?

21:14.100 --> 21:15.100
>> CAITLYN: Five minutes, eight

21:15.100 --> 21:16.100
minutes.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.200
It's just, emotionally will you

21:17.200 --> 21:18.200
be able to take it?

21:18.200 --> 21:18.867
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

21:18.867 --> 21:19.700
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, that's the

21:19.700 --> 21:20.400
tough one.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.500
>> CANDIS: We'll be there to

21:21.500 --> 21:22.267
support you.

21:22.267 --> 21:23.267
>> CAITLYN: I know.

21:23.267 --> 21:24.333
>> CANDIS: For moral support.

21:24.333 --> 21:25.700
>> CAITLYN: Yay!

21:25.700 --> 21:27.667
(clapping)

21:29.667 --> 21:32.067
But it's so, so important that I

21:32.067 --> 21:33.667
get it right-- so important for

21:33.667 --> 21:36.633
me to represent myself well,

21:36.633 --> 21:39.233
so important for this community,

21:39.233 --> 21:40.833
so important for the public, and

21:40.833 --> 21:42.933
also so important of where

21:42.933 --> 21:45.067
I'm saying these words.

21:45.067 --> 21:46.067
It'll be really tough to

21:46.067 --> 21:47.067
get through.

21:47.067 --> 21:48.767
>> PAM: Is Kris gonna be there?

21:48.767 --> 21:50.300
>> CAITLYN: No.

21:50.300 --> 21:51.667
I didn't invite her.

21:51.667 --> 21:53.067
She hasn't called me, talked to

21:53.067 --> 21:54.833
me.

21:54.833 --> 21:56.467
Yeah, I've called her a couple

21:56.467 --> 21:59.067
times, but not many, you know?

21:59.067 --> 22:00.467
Okay.

22:00.467 --> 22:03.767
It is what it is.

22:03.767 --> 22:04.933
With Kris and I, I don't think

22:04.933 --> 22:05.933
she realized it would come to

22:05.933 --> 22:06.933
this.

22:06.933 --> 22:07.933
>> JENNY: How is she?

22:07.933 --> 22:08.933
>> CAITLYN: I don't know.

22:08.933 --> 22:09.933
She doesn't talk.

22:09.933 --> 22:10.933
>> DEEDIE: You haven't talked to

22:10.933 --> 22:11.933
her.

22:11.933 --> 22:12.933
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

22:12.933 --> 22:14.200
Honestly, I don't think I've

22:14.200 --> 22:17.200
been ready for the big "Kris"

22:17.200 --> 22:18.500
meeting and talk.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.933
You know, we did have a lot of

22:19.933 --> 22:21.067
great times.

22:21.067 --> 22:22.600
And so, for the kids, Kendall

22:22.600 --> 22:24.333
and Kylie, I don't want tension.

22:24.333 --> 22:26.933
(knocking)

22:26.933 --> 22:28.500
It is really very, very

22:28.500 --> 22:30.600
difficult.

22:32.067 --> 22:34.333
(birds chirping)

22:34.333 --> 22:35.800
>> CANDIS: Hi. I love it.

22:35.800 --> 22:36.800
>> CAITLYN: How are all my

22:36.800 --> 22:38.100
girls?

22:38.100 --> 22:39.267
How you doing?

22:39.267 --> 22:41.533
Good to see you.

22:41.533 --> 22:43.567
You all... you all get to meet

22:43.567 --> 22:44.567
my mother.

22:44.567 --> 22:45.767
>> CHANDI: Oh, my goodness.

22:45.767 --> 22:46.767
Mwah.

22:46.767 --> 22:47.767
>> CAITLYN: Look at you.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.100
Do you got any clothes on?

22:49.100 --> 22:51.300
Really. It's...

22:51.300 --> 22:52.300
We see through all of that...

22:52.300 --> 22:53.567
>> CANDIS: No, it's nude.

22:53.567 --> 22:55.167
It's nude. It's-it's fully...

22:55.167 --> 22:56.833
it's fully covered, honey.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.467
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God, Mom.

22:58.467 --> 23:00.600
>> WOMAN: Look who is here.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.900
>> CAITLYN: My mom, she really

23:01.900 --> 23:03.500
felt a need to come down here,

23:03.500 --> 23:05.633
and it makes me feel good that

23:05.633 --> 23:07.267
it's that important to her for

23:07.267 --> 23:09.133
her to be here to show her

23:09.133 --> 23:10.267
support.

23:10.267 --> 23:12.367
And I feel like my mom has to

23:12.367 --> 23:14.867
meet the other girls.

23:14.867 --> 23:16.167
>> CHANDI: Hi, Mom.

23:16.167 --> 23:17.500
Nice to meet you.

23:17.500 --> 23:18.500
>> CAITLYN: This is Chandi.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.500
>> ESTHER: Nice to meet you.

23:19.500 --> 23:20.500
I can't turn around.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.733
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

23:21.733 --> 23:22.733
>> CANDIS: I'm coming over here.

23:22.733 --> 23:24.933
>> ESTHER: Come on over here.

23:24.933 --> 23:27.100
Okay, Candis, you're a-a new

23:27.100 --> 23:28.300
friend of Bruce's?

23:28.300 --> 23:29.433
>> CANDIS: Yeah. Yeah.

23:29.433 --> 23:31.233
>> ESTHER: It's all new to me.

23:31.233 --> 23:32.233
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

23:32.233 --> 23:33.233
>> ESTHER: The hard thing is

23:33.233 --> 23:36.100
going to be...

23:36.100 --> 23:37.100
>> CANDIS: Pronouns.

23:37.100 --> 23:38.533
>> ESTHER (laughs): Pronouns.

23:38.533 --> 23:39.667
>> CAITLYN: I never thought the

23:39.667 --> 23:40.833
day would come that actually I

23:40.833 --> 23:42.400
would be with my two sisters, a

23:42.400 --> 23:45.400
bunch of trans women, and my

23:45.400 --> 23:46.767
89-year-old mother, and

23:46.767 --> 23:48.733
everybody having a good time.

23:48.733 --> 23:50.167
I'm having a good time, so...

23:50.167 --> 23:51.533
Yeah, it's just... it's just a

23:51.533 --> 23:52.900
good, comfortable feeling.

23:52.900 --> 23:56.400
>> ESTHER: How long has Candis

23:56.400 --> 23:58.433
come forward with her...

23:58.433 --> 23:59.433
>> CAITLYN: Transition.

23:59.433 --> 24:00.633
>> ESTHER: Transition, yeah.

24:00.633 --> 24:01.967
>> CAITLYN: When did you... go

24:01.967 --> 24:02.967
full-time?

24:02.967 --> 24:06.133
>> CANDIS: Uh, in '95?

24:06.133 --> 24:07.633
20 years ago.

24:07.633 --> 24:10.500
>> ESTHER: When did you realize

24:10.500 --> 24:12.200
that you felt differently about

24:12.200 --> 24:13.333
yourself?

24:13.333 --> 24:14.333
>> CHANDI: Well, I always felt

24:14.333 --> 24:15.333
different.

24:15.333 --> 24:16.800
Um, probably, like, around the

24:16.800 --> 24:18.567
age of 23, I started taking

24:18.567 --> 24:21.933
hormones, and, um, I decided to

24:21.933 --> 24:23.833
do it all the time.

24:23.833 --> 24:24.933
>> ESTHER: I got so much to

24:24.933 --> 24:26.067
learn.

24:26.067 --> 24:27.533
>> CHANDI: Oh!

24:27.533 --> 24:28.867
>> JEN: I think for the first

24:28.867 --> 24:30.300
half of our lives, our parents

24:30.300 --> 24:31.933
teach us, and then we teach our

24:31.933 --> 24:33.300
parents.

24:33.300 --> 24:34.633
>> CAITLYN: That's very true.

24:34.633 --> 24:35.633
>> PAM: It's gonna be quite a

24:35.633 --> 24:36.633
night, isn't it?

24:36.633 --> 24:37.633
What are you wearing for the

24:37.633 --> 24:38.633
ESPYs?

24:38.633 --> 24:39.633
>> CHANDI: Purplish fuchsia.

24:39.633 --> 24:40.633
Candis's designer made me a

24:40.633 --> 24:41.633
dress.

24:41.633 --> 24:42.633
>> JEN: What are you wearing,

24:42.633 --> 24:43.633
Esther?

24:43.633 --> 24:44.633
Do you have an outfit?

24:44.633 --> 24:45.633
>> ESTHER: You know, I have an

24:45.633 --> 24:46.633
old dress.

24:46.633 --> 24:48.500
I got it. Tomorrow, I got to

24:48.500 --> 24:51.067
find some thigh-high stockings.

24:51.067 --> 24:52.600
And those thigh-highs, I've had

24:52.600 --> 24:54.767
them before, and sometimes they

24:54.767 --> 24:55.767
slip.

24:55.767 --> 24:56.767
>> CANDIS: They do, but they're

24:56.767 --> 24:57.767
sexy.

24:57.767 --> 24:58.767
>> ESTHER: Yeah.

24:58.767 --> 24:59.767
>> CANDIS: Yeah. (laughs)

24:59.767 --> 25:00.833
>> ESTHER: But I'm not... I

25:00.833 --> 25:01.833
mean, I...

25:01.833 --> 25:02.833
>> CAITLYN: Mom doesn't need

25:02.833 --> 25:03.967
that-- she's had enough men in

25:03.967 --> 25:05.700
her life.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.167
>> ESTHER: What do you mean?

25:07.167 --> 25:08.167
>> CAITLYN: Oh, God.

25:08.167 --> 25:10.133
(laughter)

25:12.367 --> 25:14.333
(crickets chirping)

25:17.100 --> 25:19.067
(seagulls calling)

25:22.200 --> 25:24.400
>> CAITLYN: * Let's do it.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.467
(humming)

25:27.467 --> 25:29.433
Let's do it.

25:31.833 --> 25:33.567
Today's the big day.

25:33.567 --> 25:34.967
It's time for the ESPYs.

25:34.967 --> 25:36.133
I'm exc... Actually, I'm very

25:36.133 --> 25:37.267
excited about this.

25:37.267 --> 25:38.667
All right, I'm out of here.

25:38.667 --> 25:39.767
Hiding in the back.

25:39.767 --> 25:41.200
My whole family's going to be

25:41.200 --> 25:43.167
there, right by my side, but I

25:43.167 --> 25:45.267
really wonder what the reaction

25:45.267 --> 25:47.800
is going to be.

25:47.800 --> 25:48.800
Actually, this is quite

25:48.800 --> 25:50.367
comfortable.

25:50.367 --> 25:51.367
>> PRODUCER: You've got a

25:51.367 --> 25:52.367
pillow.

25:52.367 --> 25:53.367
>> CAITLYN: I've got my little

25:53.367 --> 25:55.333
pillow.

26:00.300 --> 26:02.267
(birds chirping)

26:05.267 --> 26:07.533
(horns honking)

26:11.167 --> 26:13.167
>> CANDIS: Hi, everybody.

26:13.167 --> 26:16.067
Um, I'm here with Chandi.

26:16.067 --> 26:18.667
We just went through the little

26:18.667 --> 26:21.967
red carpet, and, um, we're super

26:21.967 --> 26:23.500
excited to see Cait.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.767
>> CHANDI: This is going to be

26:25.767 --> 26:27.567
such a historical moment, and

26:27.567 --> 26:30.600
Candis felt like I needed my own

26:30.600 --> 26:32.467
staple ESPY dress, and that just

26:32.467 --> 26:33.867
meant the world to me.

26:33.867 --> 26:36.133
Wow.

26:36.133 --> 26:37.900
Yes, I am living.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.533
Let me give you triple hugs.

26:39.533 --> 26:41.600
Triple, triple, triple.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.767
I told my mom, "I didn't make it

26:43.767 --> 26:45.233
to the ESPYs playing football,

26:45.233 --> 26:46.667
but I made it, girl."

26:46.667 --> 26:48.633
I just don't know what to say.

26:48.633 --> 26:50.433
Having someone do something nice

26:50.433 --> 26:52.700
for me is just so touching,

26:52.700 --> 26:55.333
really.

26:55.333 --> 26:57.300
Thank you.

26:59.333 --> 27:00.400
>> CANDIS: It's gonna be fun.

27:00.400 --> 27:01.600
I'm excited.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.567
It's monumental.

27:06.667 --> 27:07.667
>> STYLIST: I got it real

27:07.667 --> 27:09.133
straight here.

27:09.133 --> 27:10.300
Yeah.

27:10.300 --> 27:11.467
>> CAITLYN: Here I am, getting

27:11.467 --> 27:13.867
real close to it.

27:13.867 --> 27:16.067
Donatella Versace sent this

27:16.067 --> 27:18.500
fabulous Versace gown.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.767
But I feel so much pressure

27:20.767 --> 27:22.933
giving this speech.

27:22.933 --> 27:25.267
Uh, I-I hope the reception is

27:25.267 --> 27:26.333
good.

27:26.333 --> 27:28.333
Um, I hope that I say the... all

27:28.333 --> 27:30.600
the right things.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.400
And I hope that, uh, most

27:32.400 --> 27:33.433
importantly, my kids are proud

27:33.433 --> 27:35.400
of me.

27:37.767 --> 27:39.067
>> ABBY WAMBACH: Ladies and

27:39.067 --> 27:41.800
gentlemen, the courageous, the

27:41.800 --> 27:44.533
stunning Caitlyn Jenner.

27:44.533 --> 27:46.500
(applause, cheering)

27:55.200 --> 27:56.400
(Caitlyn exhales)

27:56.400 --> 27:58.100
>> CAITLYN: I'm standing there,

27:58.100 --> 28:01.100
all Caitlyn, totally out.

28:01.100 --> 28:03.533
I feel...

28:03.533 --> 28:06.700
so unbelievably vulnerable.

28:08.733 --> 28:11.533
I'd like to thank my family.

28:11.533 --> 28:13.067
The biggest fear I've always had

28:13.067 --> 28:16.200
in coming out is I never wanted

28:16.200 --> 28:18.667
to hurt anyone else.

28:18.667 --> 28:21.400
Most of all...

28:21.400 --> 28:23.833
my family and my kids.

28:23.833 --> 28:25.067
I always wanted my children to

28:25.067 --> 28:27.100
be so proud of their dad.

28:27.100 --> 28:28.200
Love you very much.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.600
I'm so glad you're here to share

28:29.600 --> 28:30.800
this with me.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.567
(applause)

28:32.567 --> 28:34.067
If you want to call me names,

28:34.067 --> 28:35.800
make jokes, doubt my intentions,

28:35.800 --> 28:37.233
go ahead.

28:37.233 --> 28:39.167
Because the reality is: I can

28:39.167 --> 28:40.600
take it.

28:40.600 --> 28:41.900
But for the thousands of kids

28:41.900 --> 28:44.067
out there coming to terms with

28:44.067 --> 28:46.833
being true to who they are, they

28:46.833 --> 28:48.100
shouldn't have to take it.

28:48.100 --> 28:49.633
(applause)

28:49.633 --> 28:51.067
Thank you so much for this

28:51.067 --> 28:52.067
honor.

28:52.067 --> 28:54.067
Thank you.

28:56.433 --> 28:59.333
The ESPYs are over, and it was

28:59.333 --> 29:00.400
good.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.600
What an enormous amount of

29:02.600 --> 29:04.533
weight off my shoulders.

29:04.533 --> 29:06.533
I think I made all my points I

29:06.533 --> 29:08.933
wanted to make, um, because this

29:08.933 --> 29:10.933
is bigger than just me.

29:10.933 --> 29:12.533
This is about this community and

29:12.533 --> 29:14.267
the fight that we have to

29:14.267 --> 29:16.533
constantly have, uh, with the

29:16.533 --> 29:18.300
media, with the public, for

29:18.300 --> 29:19.967
understanding.

29:19.967 --> 29:21.500
I did it!

29:21.500 --> 29:23.500
Family support is everything.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.567
You have to have that structure

29:25.567 --> 29:27.433
below you to get to the next

29:27.433 --> 29:28.700
level.

29:28.700 --> 29:31.067
Kris and I still haven't spoken.

29:31.067 --> 29:32.300
I mean, she's been there for me

29:32.300 --> 29:33.567
for the last 25 years, you know,

29:33.567 --> 29:35.467
at all the big events.

29:35.467 --> 29:37.633
And she wasn't there.

29:37.633 --> 29:38.800
To be honest with you, that

29:38.800 --> 29:40.767
makes me sad.

29:46.733 --> 29:48.600
(sniffles)

29:48.600 --> 29:51.233
You know, in this whole...

29:51.233 --> 29:52.667
transition thing, Kris and I

29:52.667 --> 29:54.233
really have not talked.

29:54.233 --> 29:56.367
We haven't spent any time

29:56.367 --> 29:58.100
together in, really, the last

29:58.100 --> 29:59.167
year.

29:59.167 --> 30:00.333
Honestly, I don't think I've

30:00.333 --> 30:03.933
been ready for the big "Kris"

30:03.933 --> 30:06.433
meeting and talk, but...

30:08.467 --> 30:09.500
You know, that'll be a tough

30:09.500 --> 30:11.467
day.

30:15.100 --> 30:16.733
(birds chirping)

30:16.733 --> 30:17.733
(knocking)

30:17.733 --> 30:18.933
(door opens)

30:18.933 --> 30:19.967
>> CAITLYN: Oh, boy, we got

30:19.967 --> 30:21.167
designers. How are you?

30:21.167 --> 30:22.433
>> MARY: Hi. How are you?

30:22.433 --> 30:23.433
Mary Ta. Nice to meet you.

30:23.433 --> 30:24.433
>> CAITLYN: Mary, nice to meet

30:24.433 --> 30:25.100
you.

30:25.100 --> 30:25.767
>> SETH: Hi, Seth.

30:25.767 --> 30:26.633
Nice to meet you.

30:26.633 --> 30:27.633
>> CAITLYN: Nice to meet you.

30:27.633 --> 30:29.567
Come on in. Here we are.

30:29.567 --> 30:31.533
Uh, this is all furniture,

30:31.533 --> 30:32.733
actually, I had from the other

30:32.733 --> 30:33.733
house.

30:33.733 --> 30:34.733
>> SETH: Okay.

30:34.733 --> 30:35.800
>> CAITLYN: When I bought this

30:35.800 --> 30:37.733
house, it was the first time

30:37.733 --> 30:40.433
that I bought my own home.

30:40.433 --> 30:41.900
In fact, Kris bought one house

30:41.900 --> 30:43.200
that I didn't even see until

30:43.200 --> 30:44.600
after she bought it.

30:44.600 --> 30:45.667
Here's the main area that Kris

30:45.667 --> 30:46.667
designed.

30:46.667 --> 30:48.133
Kris used to take care of all of

30:48.133 --> 30:49.500
this-- the furniture, the rugs,

30:49.500 --> 30:50.500
the paint, the colors.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.500
>> KRIS: We got this.

30:51.500 --> 30:52.500
>> MAN: What colors?

30:52.500 --> 30:53.500
>> KRIS: That's the $60 million

30:53.500 --> 30:54.800
question.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.700
>> CAITLYN: I have actually

30:56.700 --> 30:59.067
never decorated one.

30:59.067 --> 31:00.133
>> LORI: We are Lori Margolis

31:00.133 --> 31:00.633
Interiors.

31:00.633 --> 31:01.467
>> CAITLYN: Right.

31:01.467 --> 31:02.300
>> LORI: We're gonna show you

31:02.300 --> 31:03.433
what your home could possibly

31:03.433 --> 31:04.067
look like.

31:04.067 --> 31:04.933
>> CAITLYN: I love the colors on

31:04.933 --> 31:05.600
that.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.067
I have no idea where to start.

31:07.067 --> 31:07.667
Caitlyn. Nice to see you.

31:07.667 --> 31:08.400
>> CHRISTOPHER: Nice to see you,

31:08.400 --> 31:09.067
Caitlyn.

31:09.067 --> 31:10.067
>> CAITLYN: Let's talk houses.

31:10.067 --> 31:11.067
>> CHRISTOPHER: I think once we

31:11.067 --> 31:12.067
know what we're doing in the

31:12.067 --> 31:13.067
living room, then we can sort of

31:13.067 --> 31:14.067
let that influence our decisions

31:14.067 --> 31:14.733
out here.

31:14.733 --> 31:15.467
>> RONDA: 'Cause this is...

31:15.467 --> 31:16.300
>> CHRISTOPHER: 'Cause it's

31:16.300 --> 31:17.100
gonna be more cohesive.

31:17.100 --> 31:17.967
I mean, that's what it's all

31:17.967 --> 31:18.967
about, living in California.

31:18.967 --> 31:20.100
>> CAITLYN: To me, this process

31:20.100 --> 31:21.100
is really interesting.

31:21.100 --> 31:21.833
>> CHRISTOPHER: Well, thank you

31:21.833 --> 31:22.500
very much.

31:22.500 --> 31:23.300
>> CAITLYN: Actually, I'm very

31:23.300 --> 31:24.300
excited to express myself in

31:24.300 --> 31:26.500
this way for the first time in

31:26.500 --> 31:28.167
my life.

31:28.167 --> 31:29.167
>> SUSAN: Welcome to Shine by

31:29.167 --> 31:30.167
S.H.O.

31:30.167 --> 31:31.167
We've got a lot of glamorous

31:31.167 --> 31:32.167
options for you.

31:32.167 --> 31:33.167
>> CAITLYN: Good.

31:33.167 --> 31:34.400
I think I'm gonna learn a lot

31:34.400 --> 31:35.600
about myself.

31:35.600 --> 31:36.967
Of course, Candis?

31:36.967 --> 31:37.967
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

31:37.967 --> 31:38.967
>> CAITLYN: Get the other side.

31:38.967 --> 31:40.667
>> WOMAN: Okay, ladies.

31:40.667 --> 31:43.100
Picture time! Oh, yes!

31:43.100 --> 31:44.667
>> CAITLYN: What do you think?

31:44.667 --> 31:45.867
>> CANDIS: It's comfortable.

31:45.867 --> 31:46.867
>> CAITLYN: Comfortable. It is.

31:46.867 --> 31:47.867
>> CANDIS: Yeah. I think we

31:47.867 --> 31:49.067
could do this.

31:49.067 --> 31:51.100
(laughter)

31:56.067 --> 31:57.067
>> CAITLYN: Kris and I right

31:57.067 --> 31:58.467
now-- uh, I learn more about her

31:58.467 --> 32:00.533
by reading stuff online.

32:00.533 --> 32:01.700
When Kris and I separated, it

32:01.700 --> 32:04.700
was as much, uh, her idea as it

32:04.700 --> 32:05.700
was mine.

32:05.700 --> 32:06.700
And we mutually decided to go

32:06.700 --> 32:07.700
our separate directions.

32:07.700 --> 32:08.700
She went out and found a house

32:08.700 --> 32:09.700
for me.

32:09.700 --> 32:10.700
She went out and decorated that

32:10.700 --> 32:11.700
house for me.

32:11.700 --> 32:13.533
She was ready for me to get out

32:13.533 --> 32:14.700
of that place, you know?

32:14.700 --> 32:15.767
It's been tough.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.233
You know, I feel bad about it.

32:17.233 --> 32:18.400
Um, you know, 'cause we've

32:18.400 --> 32:19.667
always wanted...

32:19.667 --> 32:20.667
It's so important.

32:20.667 --> 32:21.600
I've always wanted to keep a

32:21.600 --> 32:22.633
good relationship with her

32:22.633 --> 32:24.167
because of the kids.

32:24.167 --> 32:26.367
And I think it just creates more

32:26.367 --> 32:27.800
tension if we are showing

32:27.800 --> 32:28.800
tension.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.633
It puts the kids-- especially

32:30.633 --> 32:32.400
Kendall and Kylie-- in a real

32:32.400 --> 32:35.333
tough situation, so, um...

32:35.333 --> 32:36.600
Hey, I don't know.

32:36.600 --> 32:40.067
Maybe it's time... to kind of

32:40.067 --> 32:42.067
reach out to her, give her a

32:42.067 --> 32:43.267
call.

32:43.267 --> 32:44.600
(dialing)

32:44.600 --> 32:46.567
Uh...

32:52.667 --> 32:55.633
(line ringing)

33:00.233 --> 33:02.200
Come on.

33:07.400 --> 33:08.533
Maybe she's not answering my

33:08.533 --> 33:09.533
phone.

33:09.533 --> 33:10.533
>> FEMALE VOICE: I'm sorry.

33:10.533 --> 33:11.533
The person you are trying to

33:11.533 --> 33:12.667
reach has a voice mailbox that

33:12.667 --> 33:13.933
has not been set up yet.

33:13.933 --> 33:14.933
Please try your call again

33:14.933 --> 33:16.100
later.

33:16.100 --> 33:17.667
(phone beeps)

33:17.667 --> 33:19.067
>> CAITLYN: Call again later.

33:19.067 --> 33:21.067
That's my life.

33:27.300 --> 33:29.900
(birds chirping)

33:29.900 --> 33:30.933
Isn't it beautiful out here?

33:30.933 --> 33:31.833
>> JENNY: Look at you.

33:31.833 --> 33:33.133
Your skirt matches the, uh...

33:33.133 --> 33:34.367
all the... all the... all the

33:34.367 --> 33:35.067
chairs.

33:35.067 --> 33:35.733
>> CAITLYN: Hey, baby.

33:35.733 --> 33:36.600
>> JENNY: Hi, darlin' darlin'.

33:36.600 --> 33:37.400
>> CAITLYN: I haven't seen you.

33:37.400 --> 33:38.133
>> JENNY: Oh, my goodness.

33:38.133 --> 33:38.967
>> CAITLYN: Well, this must be

33:38.967 --> 33:39.967
Deedie.

33:39.967 --> 33:40.867
>> DEEDIE: That's right.

33:40.867 --> 33:41.700
>> JENNY: This is my wife

33:41.700 --> 33:42.200
Deedie.

33:42.200 --> 33:42.867
>> CAITLYN: Unbelievable.

33:42.867 --> 33:43.600
>> DEEDIE: What a pleasure to

33:43.600 --> 33:44.333
meet you. Oh, my God.

33:44.333 --> 33:45.067
>> CAITLYN: What a nice

33:45.067 --> 33:46.100
opportunity to meet you.

33:46.100 --> 33:47.067
So...

33:47.067 --> 33:48.067
>> JENNY: I'm so glad for you to

33:48.067 --> 33:50.067
meet Deedie, because Deedie is

33:50.067 --> 33:52.400
the center of my life, and it

33:52.400 --> 33:53.867
was her love that made it

33:53.867 --> 33:54.867
possible for me.

33:54.867 --> 33:55.867
>> CAITLYN: I can't believe you

33:55.867 --> 33:56.867
put up with her.

33:56.867 --> 33:57.867
>> DEEDIE: I know.

33:57.867 --> 33:58.533
It's impossible.

33:58.533 --> 33:59.500
>> CAITLYN: I don't know you do

33:59.500 --> 34:00.200
it.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.067
>> JENNY: Yeah, well, it's true.

34:01.067 --> 34:01.700
Well, how are you doing?

34:01.700 --> 34:02.600
>> CAITLYN: I bet you there's

34:02.600 --> 34:04.333
just a handful of woman who have

34:04.333 --> 34:06.233
stayed as their husbands would

34:06.233 --> 34:07.233
transition.

34:07.233 --> 34:08.233
>> JENNY: Something like a third

34:08.233 --> 34:09.233
of marriages stay together.

34:09.233 --> 34:10.233
>> CAITLYN: A third?

34:10.233 --> 34:11.233
>> JENNY: The longer you've been

34:11.233 --> 34:12.233
with someone, the more likely

34:12.233 --> 34:13.233
the marriage is to stay

34:13.233 --> 34:14.067
together.

34:14.067 --> 34:15.067
>> CAITLYN: This was a long time

34:15.067 --> 34:15.567
ago.

34:15.567 --> 34:16.367
How many years ago?

34:16.367 --> 34:17.433
>> JENNY: Uh, 14, 15 years.

34:17.433 --> 34:18.333
>> DEEDIE: Almost 15, yeah.

34:18.333 --> 34:19.067
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

34:19.067 --> 34:20.233
>> JENNY: Yeah. Um, yeah, we've

34:20.233 --> 34:22.500
now lived together as wife and

34:22.500 --> 34:23.667
wife longer than we lived as

34:23.667 --> 34:24.667
husband and wife.

34:24.667 --> 34:25.667
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

34:25.667 --> 34:27.600
See, I've thought about it.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.367
With Kris and I-- although I

34:29.367 --> 34:31.067
certainly was open with her

34:31.067 --> 34:32.367
before we got married...

34:32.367 --> 34:33.367
>> DEEDIE: Mm-hmm.

34:33.367 --> 34:34.500
>> CAITLYN: ...I don't think she

34:34.500 --> 34:36.067
realized it would come to this,

34:36.067 --> 34:38.433
which I get.

34:38.433 --> 34:40.600
And probably, knowing me, I

34:40.600 --> 34:41.733
downplayed it.

34:41.733 --> 34:42.733
>> JENNY: How is she?

34:42.733 --> 34:43.933
>> CAITLYN: Hmm?

34:43.933 --> 34:44.933
>> JENNY: How is she?

34:44.933 --> 34:45.933
>> CAITLYN: I don't know.

34:45.933 --> 34:46.933
She doesn't talk.

34:46.933 --> 34:47.933
>> DEEDIE: You haven't talked to

34:47.933 --> 34:48.933
her.

34:48.933 --> 34:51.200
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.200
Yeah.

34:52.200 --> 34:54.100
Last time Kris and I sat down,

34:54.100 --> 34:56.500
it was really tough.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.533
>> KRIS: You were angry...

34:57.533 --> 34:58.533
>> CAITLYN: When you're in...

34:58.533 --> 34:59.533
>> KRIS: ...which made me angry.

34:59.533 --> 35:00.600
>> CAITLYN: You know you treated

35:00.600 --> 35:02.267
me badly those last four or five

35:02.267 --> 35:04.167
years of our marriage.

35:04.167 --> 35:06.200
I wasn't happy.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.433
>> KRIS: You never even told me

35:07.433 --> 35:08.767
as a married couple that you

35:08.767 --> 35:10.200
were taking hormones.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.200
>> CAITLYN: It's much easier to

35:11.200 --> 35:12.200
talk to somebody that you're

35:12.200 --> 35:13.200
not gonna hurt.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.200
It's just...

35:14.200 --> 35:15.200
>> KRIS (crying): But you have

35:15.200 --> 35:16.200
to tell the truth.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.267
You just have to tell the truth.

35:17.267 --> 35:18.133
>> CAITLYN: That's what I'm

35:18.133 --> 35:19.133
trying to do.

35:19.133 --> 35:20.067
For the first time in my life,

35:20.067 --> 35:21.600
I'm trying to tell the truth.

35:21.600 --> 35:22.600
>> JENNY: You're gonna have to

35:22.600 --> 35:23.867
wait her out, and she may not

35:23.867 --> 35:25.967
feel about you the way you want

35:25.967 --> 35:26.967
and need her to feel about you.

35:26.967 --> 35:27.967
>> CAITLYN: Trust me, we haven't

35:27.967 --> 35:29.067
talked in months.

35:29.067 --> 35:30.067
>> DEEDIE: Mm.

35:30.067 --> 35:31.067
>> JENNY: Really?

35:31.067 --> 35:32.567
>> CAITLYN: No.

35:32.567 --> 35:35.167
>> JENNY: Do you want to talk?

35:40.067 --> 35:41.067
(birds chirping)

35:41.067 --> 35:42.300
>> CAITLYN: With Kris and I-- we

35:42.300 --> 35:43.300
haven't talked in months.

35:43.300 --> 35:44.300
>> DEEDIE: Mm.

35:44.300 --> 35:45.300
>> JENNY: Really?

35:45.300 --> 35:47.233
>> CAITLYN: No.

35:47.233 --> 35:49.200
>> JENNY: Do you want to talk?

35:53.300 --> 35:54.633
I wish... I wish that you had

35:54.633 --> 35:56.300
what I... the gift that I had.

35:56.300 --> 35:57.300
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

35:57.300 --> 35:58.300
>> JENNY: Um, because it's...

35:58.300 --> 35:59.333
>> CAITLYN: The understanding.

35:59.333 --> 36:00.400
>> DEEDIE: Well, the

36:00.400 --> 36:01.800
understanding didn't come

36:01.800 --> 36:03.367
immediately, but the support was

36:03.367 --> 36:04.600
always there.

36:04.600 --> 36:05.600
In families, processes don't

36:05.600 --> 36:06.600
happen...

36:06.600 --> 36:07.600
>> CAITLYN: Right. Yeah.

36:07.600 --> 36:08.600
>> DEEDIE: ...in sync often.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.600
>> JENNY: This is my wife, the

36:09.600 --> 36:10.600
social worker.

36:10.600 --> 36:11.533
(Deedie laughs)

36:11.533 --> 36:12.367
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I understand.

36:12.367 --> 36:13.200
>> JENNY: In addition to being

36:13.200 --> 36:14.333
the love of my life, she's also

36:14.333 --> 36:15.367
a social worker, which was a

36:15.367 --> 36:16.733
good skill to have.

36:16.733 --> 36:18.500
>> DEEDIE: As the trans person

36:18.500 --> 36:20.800
moves into their new, brilliant,

36:20.800 --> 36:23.667
always-wanted-to-be true self,

36:23.667 --> 36:25.167
the rest of the family is left

36:25.167 --> 36:27.067
kind of in the dust, still

36:27.067 --> 36:29.067
trying to figure out, um, what

36:29.067 --> 36:30.533
does this mean for me, and what

36:30.533 --> 36:32.167
about everything we had before.

36:32.167 --> 36:33.167
And at that moment, I was

36:33.167 --> 36:34.167
terrified.

36:34.167 --> 36:35.167
>> CAITLYN: Oh, of course.

36:35.167 --> 36:36.167
>> DEEDIE: You know, I didn't

36:36.167 --> 36:37.167
know what that meant.

36:37.167 --> 36:38.633
There's a period of real

36:38.633 --> 36:43.333
mourning, uh, the loss of your

36:43.333 --> 36:45.433
mate or your father or your

36:45.433 --> 36:46.600
partner.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.267
Even when things were very, very

36:48.267 --> 36:49.300
scary, and I didn't know what

36:49.300 --> 36:50.300
was gonna happen, and I felt

36:50.300 --> 36:51.400
like I was on, like, a-- I don't

36:51.400 --> 36:52.400
know-- a locomotive that was

36:52.400 --> 36:53.400
taking me out of control.

36:53.400 --> 36:54.400
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

36:54.400 --> 36:55.800
>> DEEDIE: And if I jumped off,

36:55.800 --> 36:56.633
I'd get hurt, and if I stayed

36:56.633 --> 36:57.467
on, I didn't know where we were

36:57.467 --> 36:58.467
going, right?

36:58.467 --> 36:59.300
>> CAITLYN: Ooh, yeah, that's

36:59.300 --> 37:00.367
exactly right.

37:00.367 --> 37:01.200
>> DEEDIE: So, but, um...

37:01.200 --> 37:02.067
>> CAITLYN: And how fast.

37:02.067 --> 37:02.900
>> DEEDIE: Right, exactly.

37:02.900 --> 37:03.700
>> CAITLYN: Going somewhere.

37:03.700 --> 37:04.533
>> DEEDIE: Or if I had to duck

37:04.533 --> 37:05.533
for the tunnel.

37:05.533 --> 37:06.367
I mean, I didn't even know how

37:06.367 --> 37:07.367
to think about it, right?

37:07.367 --> 37:08.333
People who transition

37:08.333 --> 37:10.367
get really giddy, and I was

37:10.367 --> 37:11.567
always kind... I was gonna be

37:11.567 --> 37:14.067
seen as the sad, uh, grumpy,

37:14.067 --> 37:15.300
grieving one.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.333
>> JENNY: I remember you said to

37:16.333 --> 37:17.167
me one time that you...

37:17.167 --> 37:18.300
You said something like, "I'll

37:18.300 --> 37:19.333
always be clo...

37:19.333 --> 37:20.533
I'll always be close to you.

37:20.533 --> 37:21.533
I just don't know how close."

37:21.533 --> 37:22.533
(laughter)

37:22.533 --> 37:23.533
Or something.

37:23.533 --> 37:24.867
>> DEEDIE: There were times when

37:24.867 --> 37:26.467
I said, "I can't help you with

37:26.467 --> 37:28.333
makeup and hair and jewelry, and

37:28.333 --> 37:29.333
you...

37:29.333 --> 37:30.367
By the way, you can't wear my

37:30.367 --> 37:31.367
jewelry, and you can't...

37:31.367 --> 37:32.367
And we won't be sharing

37:32.367 --> 37:33.367
clothes."

37:33.367 --> 37:34.367
That has gone away now.

37:34.367 --> 37:35.367
I steal her clothes all the

37:35.367 --> 37:36.367
time.

37:36.367 --> 37:37.367
(laughs)

37:37.367 --> 37:38.367
But she's much taller than I am.

37:38.367 --> 37:39.367
I have always thought that it's

37:39.367 --> 37:40.367
my...

37:40.367 --> 37:41.200
I get to make the choice every

37:41.200 --> 37:42.200
day.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.067
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

37:43.067 --> 37:44.067
>> DEEDIE: Every day when I wake

37:44.067 --> 37:44.833
up, whether or not this is the

37:44.833 --> 37:45.833
marriage I want or not.

37:45.833 --> 37:46.833
>> CAITLYN: Right.

37:46.833 --> 37:47.833
>> DEEDIE: And we're lucky that

37:47.833 --> 37:48.833
we continue... we continue to

37:48.833 --> 37:49.833
agree.

37:49.833 --> 37:50.833
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, you've got it.

37:50.833 --> 37:51.833
You got your partner.

37:51.833 --> 37:52.833
You're... Yeah. Yeah.

37:52.833 --> 37:53.867
>> DEEDIE: Right. And to share

37:53.867 --> 37:57.833
the same, um, vision.

37:57.833 --> 37:59.567
>> CAITLYN: Going through life

37:59.567 --> 38:02.333
with a partner, um, is

38:02.333 --> 38:04.567
extraordinarily important.

38:04.567 --> 38:05.567
Maybe I should reach out to her,

38:05.567 --> 38:06.567
give her a call.

38:06.567 --> 38:07.567
But I'm also pretty scared about

38:07.567 --> 38:08.567
it.

38:08.567 --> 38:09.567
>> DEEDIE: It's not like

38:09.567 --> 38:11.367
someone's not a good enough wife

38:11.367 --> 38:12.367
if they don't stay with their

38:12.367 --> 38:13.367
trans partner.

38:13.367 --> 38:15.600
Everybody has to decide what,

38:15.600 --> 38:16.933
um, and what makes their life

38:16.933 --> 38:18.900
the way they want it.

38:20.933 --> 38:23.333
(thunder rumbling softly)

38:28.433 --> 38:31.067
(line ringing)

38:36.333 --> 38:37.333
>> KRIS: Hello?

38:37.333 --> 38:38.333
>> CAITLYN: Hey.

38:38.333 --> 38:39.333
>> KRIS: Hey.

38:39.333 --> 38:42.333
>> CAITLYN: How are you doing?

38:42.333 --> 38:43.467
>> KRIS: I'm okay.

38:43.467 --> 38:44.800
>> CAITLYN: Good.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.100
Um, anyway, I-I just wanted to

38:47.100 --> 38:48.167
say, there's been a couple of

38:48.167 --> 38:49.300
things that have come out that

38:49.300 --> 38:51.567
have just not been very nice,

38:51.567 --> 38:55.067
you know, in the news.

38:55.067 --> 38:58.633
>> KRIS: Yeah, well... you know.

38:58.633 --> 39:00.533
>> CAITLYN: Um, you know, I am

39:00.533 --> 39:03.100
not talking to the media, uh, at

39:03.100 --> 39:04.100
all.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.200
>> KRIS: I think...

39:05.200 --> 39:06.867
Listen, you got to do what you

39:06.867 --> 39:07.867
got to do.

39:07.867 --> 39:09.467
I just think that that's gonna

39:09.467 --> 39:12.167
be expected.

39:12.167 --> 39:13.433
>> CAITLYN: You know what?

39:13.433 --> 39:14.433
I would like to see you...

39:14.433 --> 39:15.433
>> KRIS: Mm-hmm.

39:15.433 --> 39:16.433
>> CAITLYN: ...and talk for a

39:16.433 --> 39:18.067
while.

39:18.067 --> 39:19.433
>> KRIS: Yeah. I'm-I'm just...

39:19.433 --> 39:20.433
Yeah.

39:20.433 --> 39:21.433
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

39:21.433 --> 39:22.600
Kris and I really have not

39:22.600 --> 39:24.800
communicated that much,

39:24.800 --> 39:25.900
especially on the more important

39:25.900 --> 39:28.300
things, like our kids.

39:28.300 --> 39:31.067
And, uh, yeah, that really

39:31.067 --> 39:32.067
bothers me.

39:32.067 --> 39:33.133
There's a lot of

39:33.133 --> 39:34.333
miscommunication right now

39:34.333 --> 39:35.700
between the two of us.

39:35.700 --> 39:37.600
We have to talk and talk some of

39:37.600 --> 39:38.967
these things out.

39:38.967 --> 39:39.967
>> KRIS: Okay.

39:39.967 --> 39:40.967
>> CAITLYN: Good.

39:40.967 --> 39:43.933
Kris can be...

39:43.933 --> 39:47.800
very strong, very opinionated.

39:47.800 --> 39:48.800
Okay, see you tomorrow.

39:48.800 --> 39:49.800
>> KRIS: Okay, bye-bye.

39:49.800 --> 39:50.800
>> CAITLYN: Bye.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.467
It is kind of nerve-racking,

39:52.467 --> 39:55.533
but I just have to do it.

39:55.533 --> 39:57.500
(clears throat)

40:00.667 --> 40:04.033
(line ringing)

40:04.033 --> 40:05.033
>> JENNY: Hello?

40:05.033 --> 40:06.033
>> CAITLYN: Jenny!

40:06.033 --> 40:07.033
>> JENNY: Hey, what's happening,

40:07.033 --> 40:08.033
Caity?

40:08.033 --> 40:09.033
>> CAITLYN: I am still in the

40:09.033 --> 40:10.033
closet. Literally.

40:10.033 --> 40:11.033
(laughter)

40:11.033 --> 40:12.033
>> JENNY: Oh, my...

40:12.033 --> 40:13.033
>> CAITLYN: Yes.

40:13.033 --> 40:14.033
>> JENNY: I know what that

40:14.033 --> 40:15.033
closet looks like.

40:15.033 --> 40:16.033
>> CAITLYN: Yes, you know what

40:16.033 --> 40:17.867
the closet looks like. Um...

40:17.867 --> 40:18.733
>> COURTNEY: It's a really nice

40:18.733 --> 40:19.467
closet.

40:19.467 --> 40:20.233
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I haven't

40:20.233 --> 40:21.433
gotten out of the closet yet.

40:21.433 --> 40:22.667
Here's-here's the scoop.

40:22.667 --> 40:23.900
I need your advice.

40:23.900 --> 40:25.200
Kris is coming over in, like, a

40:25.200 --> 40:26.600
half hour.

40:26.600 --> 40:27.600
>> JENNY: Mm-hmm.

40:27.600 --> 40:28.600
>> CAITLYN: She's probably one

40:28.600 --> 40:31.767
of the hardest to talk to, and

40:31.767 --> 40:32.967
she technically hasn't met me.

40:32.967 --> 40:33.967
>> JENNY: Mm-hmm.

40:33.967 --> 40:34.967
>> CAITLYN: So...

40:34.967 --> 40:35.967
>> JENNY: Yeah.

40:35.967 --> 40:37.800
>> CAITLYN: Any suggestions?

40:37.800 --> 40:39.467
>> JENNY: Yeah. Remember, this

40:39.467 --> 40:40.733
is not the 400 meters.

40:40.733 --> 40:42.200
This is the marathon.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.367
Um, settling-- at least on this

40:44.367 --> 40:47.233
first day-- for letting her have

40:47.233 --> 40:48.133
her reaction, whatever it's

40:48.133 --> 40:50.367
gonna be, that's probably fine.

40:50.367 --> 40:51.267
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

40:51.267 --> 40:52.500
>> JENNY: How do you feel?

40:52.500 --> 40:53.733
>> CAITLYN: Uh, a lot of

40:53.733 --> 40:54.400
anxiety.

40:54.400 --> 40:55.167
>> JENNY: Yeah.

40:55.167 --> 40:56.067
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Yeah.

40:56.067 --> 40:57.200
>> JENNY: You have to think it's

40:57.200 --> 40:57.967
gonna be okay, and...

40:57.967 --> 40:58.733
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, all right,

40:58.733 --> 40:59.533
babe, thank you for the...

40:59.533 --> 41:00.467
>> JENNY: So, I think it's gonna

41:00.467 --> 41:01.067
be okay.

41:01.067 --> 41:01.833
>> CAITLYN: Okay. Thank you for

41:01.833 --> 41:02.500
the encouragement.

41:02.500 --> 41:03.300
I appreciate it.

41:03.300 --> 41:04.067
I got to get dressed.

41:04.067 --> 41:05.067
She's gonna be here in a little

41:05.067 --> 41:05.533
bit.

41:05.533 --> 41:06.333
>> JENNY: I'll see you later.

41:06.333 --> 41:07.067
>> CAITLYN: Love you. Bye.

41:07.067 --> 41:07.833
>> JENNY: Love you, too.

41:07.833 --> 41:08.333
Bye-bye.

41:08.333 --> 41:10.300
>> CAITLYN: Bye.

41:13.433 --> 41:14.733
>> RONDA: Time to get dressed.

41:14.733 --> 41:16.200
They are literally on their way.

41:16.200 --> 41:17.200
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

41:17.200 --> 41:20.367
(hair dryer whirring)

41:20.367 --> 41:24.233
Well, Kris is coming over.

41:24.233 --> 41:25.633
I have not seen her, talked to

41:25.633 --> 41:28.567
her...

41:28.567 --> 41:31.600
months and months and months.

41:31.600 --> 41:34.967
Finally, we're meeting today.

41:34.967 --> 41:36.233
Should be interesting.

41:36.233 --> 41:37.733
Uh, I don't know if we'll

41:37.733 --> 41:39.400
resolve anything or whatever,

41:39.400 --> 41:40.700
but, you know, I just probably

41:40.700 --> 41:41.867
should get some things off my

41:41.867 --> 41:43.867
chest, and probably her, too.

41:43.867 --> 41:44.933
You know, we did have a lot of

41:44.933 --> 41:46.067
great times.

41:46.067 --> 41:47.533
We've moved on, both of us, but

41:47.533 --> 41:48.533
I don't want to throw all the

41:48.533 --> 41:49.533
good times away.

41:49.533 --> 41:50.933
And so, for the kids-- Kendall

41:50.933 --> 41:51.967
and Kylie-- I don't want

41:51.967 --> 41:52.967
tension.

41:52.967 --> 41:53.967
I don't want to put them in a

41:53.967 --> 41:55.633
tough position.

41:55.633 --> 41:57.633
It's really very, very difficult

41:57.633 --> 42:00.067
on me.

42:00.067 --> 42:02.067
(knocking)

42:07.767 --> 42:08.767
>> KRIS: Hello.

42:08.767 --> 42:09.767
Oh, my goodness.

42:09.767 --> 42:11.133
>> CAITLYN: Look who's here.

42:11.133 --> 42:12.700
>> KRIS: Look at you!

42:12.700 --> 42:13.900
Nice shoes!

42:13.900 --> 42:14.967
>> CAITLYN: Do you like those?

42:14.967 --> 42:16.267
>> KRIS: Yeah.

42:16.267 --> 42:17.267
How are you? Oh...

42:17.267 --> 42:18.267
>> CAITLYN: Well, I'm fine.

42:18.267 --> 42:19.267
How are you?

42:19.267 --> 42:20.267
>> KRIS: I'm good.

42:20.267 --> 42:21.433
I brought you some cookies.

42:21.433 --> 42:23.400
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.067
>> KRIS: Where do you want to

42:31.067 --> 42:32.067
go?

42:32.067 --> 42:33.067
>> CAITLYN: Sit down here.

42:33.067 --> 42:35.067
>> KRIS: Okay.

42:44.167 --> 42:46.133
>> CAITLYN: So?

42:57.967 --> 42:58.967
>> CANDIS: You're changing your

42:58.967 --> 43:00.267
life, you're changing your name.

43:00.267 --> 43:01.300
Let's celebrate the new

43:01.300 --> 43:02.133
beginning.

43:02.133 --> 43:03.300
>> CAITLYN: Hello, everybody.

43:03.300 --> 43:04.300
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God, Boy

43:04.300 --> 43:05.300
George!

43:05.300 --> 43:06.300
(cheering)

43:06.300 --> 43:07.300
>> CAITLYN: For the first time,

43:07.300 --> 43:09.067
I feel like I fit in some place.

43:09.067 --> 43:10.067
(crying): Because of these

43:10.067 --> 43:11.100
ladies over here.

43:11.100 --> 43:12.100
(applause)

43:12.100 --> 43:13.533
>> KRIS: I was struggling and

43:13.533 --> 43:14.533
having a really hard time...

43:14.533 --> 43:15.533
>> CAITLYN: With what?

43:15.533 --> 43:16.533
>> KRIS: Your transition and

43:16.533 --> 43:17.533
this, like, leaving us in the

43:17.533 --> 43:18.533
dust.

43:18.533 --> 43:19.367
>> CAITLYN: Nobody's leaving you

43:19.367 --> 43:20.367
guys in the dust.

43:20.367 --> 43:21.200
>> KRIS: You left us in the

43:21.200 --> 43:21.867
dust.

43:21.867 --> 43:22.867
(crying): What happened to the

43:22.867 --> 43:23.867
life we had together?

43:23.867 --> 43:24.700
>> CAITLYN: Don't play the

43:24.700 --> 43:25.433
martyr.

43:25.433 --> 43:26.567
Never texted me, never said

43:26.567 --> 43:27.633
anything, never called.
