WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.135
- So, what now?
- We don't want two days without a paper,

00:04.160 --> 00:05.359
so let's just get on with it.

00:05.360 --> 00:06.919
- But West...
- We're not finished with West.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.325
Do something else.

00:08.326 --> 00:10.319
Tell me where you got it or you're fired.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.399
Duncan said that you're our best
reporter.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.796
Well, you were responsible
for our best story in weeks

00:14.797 --> 00:17.519
and you are standing in my office
with a staff card.

00:17.520 --> 00:18.879
Come and write for us.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.359
Break free!

00:20.360 --> 00:21.599
Everybody knows you're sleeping together.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.119
You think you're hiding it,
but you're not.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.239
Hey! Hey, hey!

00:24.240 --> 00:25.279
You need to move out.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.199
- Sorry?
- I'm working, and I can't trust you.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.399
The Herald won't exist in two years'
time, and you know that.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.799
That's why things are going to change.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.400
Make me an offer.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.719
Hey!

01:17.720 --> 01:19.360
Slow down!

01:26.840 --> 01:28.519
Whoa! I thought you'd left.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.679
I have.

01:29.680 --> 01:30.999
Why are you dressed like that?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.239
I don't know what you mean.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.479
Well, I didn't even know
you owned a skirt. Look, woo!

01:34.480 --> 01:36.159
- Jesus!
- What? I'm joking!

01:36.160 --> 01:38.120
I'm dressed like this
because I've got a new job.

01:38.606 --> 01:40.126
Where?

01:41.120 --> 01:42.440
Oh, Holly, no!

01:43.720 --> 01:45.640
Oh, no way! Come on!

01:48.760 --> 01:49.840
Holly!

02:49.840 --> 02:51.479
Holly?

02:51.480 --> 02:52.519
Yeah.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.919
I'm Lucy, Duncan's assistant.

02:53.920 --> 02:55.799
He's busy at the moment,

02:55.800 --> 02:57.359
but if you'd just like to wait over here,

02:57.360 --> 02:58.999
and he'll be with you shortly.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.559
Can I get you anything in the meantime?

03:00.560 --> 03:02.160
No, no, I'm fine, thanks.

03:18.415 --> 03:19.919
So, right,

03:19.920 --> 03:21.759
I hope you have a brilliant day.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.481
There's so much to see.

03:23.482 --> 03:26.159
And at the end of it,
I'll be around to answer questions,

03:26.160 --> 03:27.879
which is amazing, right?

03:27.880 --> 03:29.039
Yeah.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.440
Thank you. Thanks for that.

03:31.020 --> 03:32.359
Wow, thank you!

03:32.360 --> 03:33.759
Enjoy. Have a good time.

03:33.760 --> 03:34.799
Bye!

03:34.800 --> 03:36.060
Bye!

03:36.360 --> 03:40.599
Yeah, see, I like to do my bit
to educate the new generation.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.679
God knows they need it. How you feeling?

03:42.680 --> 03:45.119
- You... You nervous?
- Not really.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.799
I thought I told you to make an
effort with your appearance.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.439
Well, I have, actually, I bought a new...

03:49.440 --> 03:51.039
Oh, no, I was joking!

03:51.040 --> 03:53.399
You're not at the Herald now.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.999
You've got to bring the funny here
or you won't fit in.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.839
- Can you be funny?
- Yeah.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.079
Tell us a joke.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.660
- Now?
- Yeah.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.919
Um...

04:02.920 --> 04:05.239
What's the difference
between a buffalo and a bison?

04:05.240 --> 04:07.039
Oh, my God.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.799
You can't wash your hands in a buffalo.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.039
And you finished it!

04:10.040 --> 04:11.079
OK, well, we'll work on that.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.879
Look, induction. Coffee's over there.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.479
If you smoke, there's a terrace upstairs.

04:14.480 --> 04:15.799
Lucy'll give you the Wi-Fi code.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.039
- Have you met Lucy?
- Yeah.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.519
She's not the sharpest,

04:18.519 --> 04:19.677
but she doesn't get on my nerves

04:19.702 --> 04:21.159
like all the others assistants I've had

04:21.160 --> 04:22.839
and she stays out of my way.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.039
That's back bench.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.639
Digital. Pictures.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.319
And, oh, this is my office,
which you know.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.480
So, there.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.599
Uh, and you graduated this summer?

04:33.600 --> 04:34.679
- Yeah.
- Where from?

04:34.680 --> 04:36.839
Cambridge, Trinity.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.439
And how long are you here for?

04:38.440 --> 04:39.605
It's a week placement,

04:39.606 --> 04:42.060
but I hope if I get on,
they might ask me back.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.359
So, you're a reporter?

04:44.360 --> 04:45.399
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.879
I started earlier this year,
but I've done pretty well.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.039
I got... I got some stories
on the front page.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.119
Wow!

04:51.120 --> 04:52.319
Anything I would have seen?

04:52.320 --> 04:54.279
Uh, the Joshua West story?

04:54.280 --> 04:55.519
That was you?

04:55.520 --> 04:57.359
Yeah, well, I found it originally.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.679
- Wow!
- Yeah.

04:58.680 --> 04:59.879
A bit of a superstar.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.599
Well, I'm just doing my job, you know.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.959
Um...

05:02.960 --> 05:04.319
I'll give you the tour.

05:04.320 --> 05:06.319
Start with the coffee,
very important. You like coffee?

05:06.320 --> 05:07.799
- Sure.
- Oh, me too!

05:07.800 --> 05:10.959
Just remind me why you
were fired from the Herald again.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.799
Was it bad dress sense
or insubordination?

05:13.800 --> 05:15.279
I wasn't fired, I'd had enough.

05:15.280 --> 05:16.439
No, yeah, I can imagine.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.800
I'd love to put the Herald
out of business.

05:20.040 --> 05:24.399
Not because it's any sort of
competition, but it ruins my view, look.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.399
Maybe I could get it condemned
or something.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.850
Are you happy with what we're paying you?

05:28.851 --> 05:31.439
More than you were getting,
but you will have to work hard.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.759
I always work hard.

05:32.760 --> 05:35.199
You're here cos Mr Emmerson's keen
to do more serious journalism,

05:35.200 --> 05:37.919
and I like to keep him happy.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.560
So that's what you'll be all about.

05:39.860 --> 05:40.999
Sound good?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.079
- Perfect.
- We're sorting a desk.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.597
As we discussed, you've got status,

05:44.622 --> 05:46.944
special correspondent, report to me.

05:52.020 --> 05:53.720
Am I supposed to say something?

05:54.020 --> 05:55.360
Are you one of us?

05:56.400 --> 05:58.079
I've only just started, so...

05:58.080 --> 05:59.479
But are you committed?

05:59.480 --> 06:01.719
Your first day and all that,
but I need to know, are you in?

06:01.720 --> 06:03.239
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

06:03.240 --> 06:04.999
- Why?
- What?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.320
Tell me why.

06:06.980 --> 06:08.919
Because I want to write
for a bigger readership,

06:08.920 --> 06:10.279
to have more resources.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.599
OK.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.720
But even so, it's a big turnaround.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.159
Persuade me.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.360
More.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.119
There were three stories
that I wanted to follow

06:25.120 --> 06:26.399
when I was at the Herald,

06:26.400 --> 06:29.039
but I couldn't cos the people
involved wanted money.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.399
And the Herald doesn't have any.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.079
The Herald are ethically opposed.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.439
Oh, yeah, but we're not so squeamish.

06:34.440 --> 06:36.040
I want to start with this.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.159
A young Syrian called Adnan Homsi

06:40.160 --> 06:42.439
got caught up in the conflict
about three years ago.

06:42.440 --> 06:43.639
He joined IS for a couple of weeks,

06:43.640 --> 06:45.341
thinking it'd help his family escape.

06:45.342 --> 06:47.019
Instead, his mother, father,

06:47.593 --> 06:51.320
nine-year-old sister were executed.

06:53.640 --> 06:56.031
He's intelligent. He's got a lot to say.

06:56.032 --> 06:57.799
But he needs £5,000 for his story.

06:57.800 --> 06:58.959
Why does he want the money?

06:58.960 --> 06:59.999
Why does he want the money?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.719
Doesn't he just want his story told
anyway?

07:01.720 --> 07:04.279
His story's all he's got.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.919
He's got to look after his brother -
rent, food, clothes...

07:06.920 --> 07:09.319
What you just told me
isn't worth five grand.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.599
Yeah, but there's more to it.

07:10.600 --> 07:11.839
5,000 more?

07:11.840 --> 07:13.040
At least!

07:16.780 --> 07:18.602
So, can I get going?
You'll give him the money?

07:18.603 --> 07:19.622
Bring him in.

07:19.623 --> 07:20.919
- Why?
- Because I want to look him in the eye

07:20.920 --> 07:22.839
before I part with that kind of money.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.200
Anyway, there's something else
I want you to start with.

07:26.060 --> 07:27.239
Look,

07:27.240 --> 07:29.439
this is the legendary safe.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.879
I assume you've heard of it.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.959
Secrets stored for a rainy day.

07:33.960 --> 07:34.999
Right.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.640
Things in here you wouldn't believe.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.800
Do you know what that is?

07:43.320 --> 07:46.119
That is secretly filmed footage

07:46.120 --> 07:49.599
of Larry Desmond
having sex on a pool table.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.039
Larry Desmond?

07:51.040 --> 07:52.999
You know, the celebrity snooker player.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.439
Massive in the '80s.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.999
Larry "The Laser" Desmond.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.799
Come on, you're not that young!

07:57.800 --> 07:59.080
Isn't Larry Desmond dead?

08:00.600 --> 08:02.800
Oh, yeah, you're right.
I knew that, but...

08:04.880 --> 08:06.239
Where is it?

08:06.240 --> 08:08.200
Yeah, this is what I wanted to show you.

08:10.040 --> 08:14.919
I had this boozy lunch with a
recently retired security adviser.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.799
Now, he couldn't tell me openly,

08:16.800 --> 08:18.799
but he'd clearly been high up at MI5.

08:18.800 --> 08:19.959
And he...

08:19.960 --> 08:25.039
He wrote this on a napkin,
and he told me to look into it,

08:25.040 --> 08:28.239
and I've got a feeling
that it might compromise the PM.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.999
I soft-pedalled it for a while,

08:30.000 --> 08:31.759
but I think the time has come.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.400
Find out what that is.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.318
What's the date mean?

08:37.320 --> 08:39.720
No idea, that's your job.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.078
Oh, right, conference.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.359
Oh, great.

08:43.360 --> 08:46.159
Oh, no, no, it's to editors
and senior staff only.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.719
Hang on, you said I'd have status.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.919
Status, yeah, but no privileges.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.199
You have to earn these things,
and you've got work to do, so...

08:52.200 --> 08:54.700
Ask Lucy about your desk.

08:55.672 --> 08:58.159
So you can report whatever you want?

08:58.160 --> 09:01.119
Oh, well, yeah, within reason.
You have to check with Raz.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.119
He's news editor.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.999
Sometimes he'll give you a story,
sometimes you'll bring something to him.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.519
I'd love that,

09:07.520 --> 09:10.959
being able to use your instinct
to chase a story.

09:10.960 --> 09:14.039
I've done it at uni, but this is
the real world, isn't it?

09:14.040 --> 09:15.959
It certainly is.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.159
Are-are you staying in London, then?

09:18.160 --> 09:19.520
With my aunt.

09:20.100 --> 09:21.719
Where do you live?

09:21.720 --> 09:24.279
I'm sort of between places at the moment.

09:24.280 --> 09:27.479
I had this flatmate,
but it didn't work out.

09:27.480 --> 09:28.519
Why not?

09:28.520 --> 09:30.599
She worked for another paper.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.079
Professional rivalry issue.
She went a bit mental.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.119
- God!
- Yeah. It was messy.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.240
Who was it?

09:39.620 --> 09:41.040
What?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.599
What was her name? I might know her.

09:43.600 --> 09:44.640
Hiya.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.679
Uh...

09:47.680 --> 09:49.080
Wh-why are you here?

09:49.500 --> 09:50.799
I work here.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.040
Special correspondent.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.279
Hi, I'm Holly.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.319
Jools.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.559
Uh, Jools is doing work experience.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.599
Right.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.999
Shadowing me for the day.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.999
- Lucky you!
- Yeah, I know.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.039
- He's showing you the ropes, is he?
- Exactly.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.079
- Dishing out his pearls of wisdom.
- Maybe we should...

10:09.080 --> 10:11.199
Did he tell you
where he gets his stories from?

10:11.200 --> 10:12.479
We were just talking about that,
actually.

10:12.480 --> 10:13.519
Really?

10:13.520 --> 10:14.639
What did he say?

10:14.640 --> 10:15.719
Well...

10:15.720 --> 10:17.319
Instinct.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.700
Fascinating.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.239
Holly?

10:21.240 --> 10:23.252
- Mm-hm?
- Your desk's just over there.

10:23.253 --> 10:25.679
Duncan said to get you
something with a view.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.959
Excellent.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.399
I got you a nice chair as well.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.879
- Thanks.
- Wow, good desk.

10:31.880 --> 10:32.999
You did something right.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.359
Yeah, he seems to think
I can bring something to the paper.

10:35.360 --> 10:36.559
He likes what I do.

10:36.560 --> 10:37.760
Oh, I bet.

10:38.820 --> 10:40.879
He's not with his wife anymore, is he?

10:40.880 --> 10:42.279
I'm sorry?

10:42.280 --> 10:45.100
I'm just saying,
he recently split up with his wife.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.239
- Conference!
- I need to go.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.839
Uh, look, maybe you should just head in.

10:50.840 --> 10:52.599
I'll grab my stuff
and I'll see you in a minute.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.320
- It's good to meet you.
- You too, Jools.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.159
Nice of you to show her around.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.639
Why are you here?

11:00.640 --> 11:02.479
I told you already, I work here.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.080
Last call!

11:05.720 --> 11:07.519
Oh, no...

11:07.520 --> 11:10.320
It's editors and senior staff,
didn't he say?

11:10.660 --> 11:12.279
What about Jools?

11:12.280 --> 11:14.000
Oh, she's my guest.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.388
Oh, come on! Look at you.

11:23.413 --> 11:25.359
You all look knackered.
What's the matter with you?

11:25.360 --> 11:27.319
Kelly. Was there a big night last night?

11:27.320 --> 11:30.199
- Your eyes look like shopping bags.
- Thanks.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.716
You couldn't get on a plane with those.

11:31.741 --> 11:33.759
They'd charge you excess baggage.

11:33.760 --> 11:37.959
But you're lucky. You get to look at
me, peak of fitness that I am.

11:37.960 --> 11:43.119
But I look at you, looking like a
waiting room in a plastic surgeon's.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.999
Except for Jools.
Everyone, this is Jools.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.679
Work experience or intern?

11:47.680 --> 11:48.879
- Work experience.
- Right.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.399
Work experience. Right. Let's start.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.480
I'm really...

11:54.480 --> 11:55.920
Holly Evans.

11:58.080 --> 12:01.119
- I think I told you.
- Yeah, you did, but...

12:01.120 --> 12:03.798
Well, then, unless you've had
a massive promotion,

12:03.799 --> 12:05.959
which I can assure you you haven't,

12:05.960 --> 12:07.639
stay on the other side of that door.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.279
- I was a senior editor.
- Yeah, over there.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.679
Here you're just a plod.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.639
You have to earn your place.

12:13.640 --> 12:14.960
Out.

12:19.020 --> 12:21.480
I won't say anything. I'll just watch.

12:21.986 --> 12:23.066
Promise.

12:27.850 --> 12:28.840
Danny Lyons.

12:28.841 --> 12:30.519
It's struck a chord.

12:30.520 --> 12:34.159
Makes sense. We all want revenge on
the blokes who stole our lunch money.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.279
Yeah, but people are outraged that

12:35.280 --> 12:38.319
the parents of the kids that he
assaulted weren't listened to.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.279
Well, are we looking into that?

12:40.280 --> 12:41.639
Why he wasn't stopped?

12:41.640 --> 12:45.159
- Yeah. School, social services...
- What about his background?

12:45.160 --> 12:47.079
- Can someone hear a noise?
- He's not that well off.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.799
- Lives with his mum and brother.
- Sort of monotonous... but whiny.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.439
What I'd want to know is, where is
he getting the behaviour from?

12:52.440 --> 12:53.799
It sounds pretty extreme.

12:53.800 --> 12:58.199
Northern, irritating sound.
Where is he now?

12:58.200 --> 13:00.799
Why haven't we got a picture of him
today?

13:00.800 --> 13:02.799
He's at home. In his room.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.559
We've got people outside,
but it's a bit...

13:04.560 --> 13:06.879
- But what?
- He's 17. We've got to be careful.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.479
Yeah? You know what he did?

13:08.480 --> 13:10.519
Who's looking after him, is one of
the questions I'd be asking.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.399
- There's that noise again.
- Look, sorry,

13:12.400 --> 13:13.900
but there's a growing voice on Twitter

13:13.925 --> 13:15.439
saying that the way he's been treated

13:15.440 --> 13:19.239
by the media, especially the Post,
is bullying itself.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.839
What, we're bullying him?!

13:20.840 --> 13:22.519
This is what people are saying, yes.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.759
While he puts three people
in the hospital,

13:24.760 --> 13:27.119
pursues them at school,
hounds them online,

13:27.120 --> 13:28.719
and we're the ones in the wrong?

13:28.720 --> 13:30.679
The point is,
you've already done the story.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.479
Don't push it. I'd move on.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.660
Would you?

13:34.300 --> 13:35.800
Yeah.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.375
I want a new picture of him
on the front page tomorrow.

13:40.376 --> 13:42.679
Find out if there's anyone else
he went after.

13:42.680 --> 13:45.568
Find whichever judge let
him off with a caution

13:45.569 --> 13:47.799
and make his life a misery.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.986
Also, see if his brother's
doing the same thing.

13:49.987 --> 13:53.399
I want us spinning this all day.
Stoke it up.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.899
- No problem.
- Yep, OK.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.519
I know this isn't what the Herald
would do.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.519
I'm not saying
it's not what the Herald would do.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.679
- But check out our circulation...
- I'm saying

14:00.680 --> 14:02.879
- it's not what the Post should do.
- Holly, come here.

14:02.880 --> 14:06.040
Come on, I'll talk to you outside.
It's important.

14:07.919 --> 14:09.519
After you.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.440
Where was I?

14:15.806 --> 14:17.366
Danny Lyons.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.559
Adnan?

15:16.560 --> 15:19.600
Hi, it's Holly Evans.
We spoke a few weeks ago.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.440
I've got a request.

15:43.313 --> 15:44.513
With me.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.483
Lucy, get the Chancellor of the Exchequer

15:56.484 --> 15:58.759
to give me a call if he's got
a moment, would you?

15:58.760 --> 16:02.360
Tell him I know we're out of favour,
but it'll do him good, all right?

16:04.840 --> 16:07.479
We're doing a story about
how much cash is in your pocket.

16:07.480 --> 16:10.079
Thought we could have a look
in the Chancellor's.

16:10.080 --> 16:13.040
- What's this?
- That's nothing.

16:14.340 --> 16:15.399
Got it.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.399
Ooh, thanks, yeah.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.719
You want me to wrap it for you?

16:18.720 --> 16:21.340
No, I'll check it first. No problem.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.480
Oh, what's the camera?

16:27.472 --> 16:29.584
What was that in there? Just showing off?

16:29.585 --> 16:32.119
I just split up with
my wife because I was sick of nagging

16:32.120 --> 16:33.799
and now I get it at work.

16:33.800 --> 16:34.959
Yeah, Ed mentioned that.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.839
- You split up with her recently?
- Yes.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.443
- Why?
- If you met her,

16:38.468 --> 16:39.999
you'd understand pretty quickly.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.359
Now, coming back to you...

16:41.360 --> 16:43.880
I wasn't saying that you should
stop with the Danny Lyons story

16:43.881 --> 16:45.155
because it's what the Herald would do.

16:45.156 --> 16:47.159
I honestly think that
you've made the wrong call.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.120
- Well, if you do that again...
- I would.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.959
- Do that again...
- I'm saying I would.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.519
- Can we talk about Adnan?
- Is he here?

16:54.520 --> 16:56.559
- No, not yet.
- Have you started on Resonance?

16:56.560 --> 16:58.760
- Yeah, I will.
- Do that first.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.638
- What?
- It must be a present,

17:04.640 --> 17:07.199
the camera, cos she asked if you
wanted it wrapping. Who's it for?

17:07.200 --> 17:08.839
- Do you like your desk?
- Yeah.

17:08.839 --> 17:10.199
- Good view?
- Very.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.599
So fuck off and sit at it.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.840
Isn't she a bit young?

17:37.440 --> 17:39.199
- I'm young.
- Not that young.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.680
She just graduated.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.519
What are you working on?

17:50.520 --> 17:51.719
Can't say.

17:51.720 --> 17:54.880
- Why not?
- You wrote the Lyons story yesterday.

17:55.180 --> 17:56.319
Yeah.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.599
Vicious.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.879
He's 17.

17:58.880 --> 18:02.000
- He's nearly an adult.
- Sure, but right now he's a child.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.314
Jools know what you're working on?

18:04.315 --> 18:06.200
If you hate what we do, why are you here?

18:08.955 --> 18:11.320
New hair, new clothes,
but you're still you, aren't you?

18:13.420 --> 18:15.940
You completely changed your opinions
as well?

18:16.400 --> 18:18.359
Journalists move papers, Ed.

18:18.360 --> 18:19.999
Happens all the time.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.030
Yeah. Not Holly Evans.

18:22.031 --> 18:25.120
Look, I've got work to do.
And your desk's where?

18:27.426 --> 18:29.986
Oh, yeah. Over there, by the toilet.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.060
He knows what you're like.

18:33.900 --> 18:36.240
He must do. So why would he get you in?

18:36.580 --> 18:39.440
Just cos of the Joshua West story?
It doesn't make any sense.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.680
Are you listening to me?

18:45.260 --> 18:47.720
You are so angry, aren't you?

18:49.112 --> 18:51.319
What bothers you so much?
That I threw you out,

18:51.320 --> 18:52.820
or I slept with you first?

18:53.820 --> 18:54.839
No.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.815
Call me a bitch or a slut
or something like that.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.039
Go on, I can tell you want to.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.519
I don't want to call you anything.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.079
- Excuse me, Holly.
- Yeah.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.159
Er, there's a man waiting for you
downstairs.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.919
- Adnan Homsi.
- Good. Duncan will want to see him.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.240
Can you bring him up?
Oh, actually, don't worry about it.

19:09.619 --> 19:11.019
I'll get him.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.040
Adnan?

19:34.913 --> 19:36.193
Thanks for coming.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.960
I thought you worked at the Herald.

19:39.429 --> 19:40.320
I moved.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.120
Just started.

19:43.460 --> 19:44.680
It's big.

19:45.020 --> 19:46.359
Which helps us.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.120
More money, frankly.

19:49.240 --> 19:50.680
Shall we?

19:50.953 --> 19:52.713
We'll need a pass.

19:55.760 --> 19:58.359
- I'm sorry that took so long.
- I'm used to it.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.479
It was great that you could come
so quickly. Were you working?

20:00.480 --> 20:02.212
Yeah. I have to get back.

20:02.213 --> 20:04.119
Well, this shouldn't take too long.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.439
Now that I'm here,
the rules are different.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.559
Presumably the money
would make a big difference.

20:08.560 --> 20:11.359
- Yeah. It would be everything.
- How is your brother?

20:11.360 --> 20:13.839
- Yeah, he's at school now.
- How's he doing?

20:13.840 --> 20:16.159
I'm told he's the joker.
He makes them all laugh.

20:16.160 --> 20:18.079
- Really?
- Yeah. Just like his uncle.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.719
He likes to mess around.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.359
But he does love it.
And they're kind to him.

20:22.360 --> 20:25.679
Well, all you've got to do is
talk to Duncan Allen,

20:25.680 --> 20:27.000
tell him what you told me.

20:27.340 --> 20:28.460
What's he like?

20:29.640 --> 20:33.520
He values honesty, so just tell him
the truth and you'll be fine.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.999
Er, take a seat.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.859
We'll get you in to see
him as soon as possible.

20:49.884 --> 20:50.959
Do you want a coffee? Water?

20:50.960 --> 20:52.640
Er, water.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.840
Give me ten minutes.

21:33.486 --> 21:34.700
Yeah.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.839
We've spoken to the ambulance crew.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.240
He's dead.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.920
His mum found him.

21:45.199 --> 21:46.679
Killed himself.

22:09.640 --> 22:10.880
Come on, then.

22:10.905 --> 22:12.225
Come on!

22:39.040 --> 22:41.799
Today is saying our front page
may have been a contributing factor.

22:41.800 --> 22:45.560
They have a source saying our story
was on his iPad when he was found.

22:47.181 --> 22:49.559
- So what's the strategy?
- How old was he?

22:49.560 --> 22:52.559
- What?
- The boy. How old was he?

22:52.560 --> 22:53.780
The boy was 17.

22:55.046 --> 22:56.406
Right.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.400
Mate.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.559
Strategy is the same.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.399
He was troubled, and in the end,

23:06.400 --> 23:09.359
did the thing
he nearly made his victims do.

23:09.360 --> 23:10.449
Punishment fits the crime.

23:10.450 --> 23:12.431
Are you saying we're still going
down that same avenue?

23:12.432 --> 23:15.359
We report his death, "a sorry end".

23:15.360 --> 23:17.719
Image of his body coming
out of the house.

23:17.720 --> 23:22.959
Front and centre, no apology, "the
villain meets his just deserts".

23:22.960 --> 23:24.239
"Bad karma".

23:24.240 --> 23:25.759
That's not going to work.

23:25.760 --> 23:28.319
Right now, you're the story. If you
ignore it, you'll look unaware.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.199
- I didn't ask you.
- Actually, it's true.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.559
Everybody's saying that our headline
pushed him over the edge.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.304
- Who? Who's everybody?
- Everybody is...

23:34.305 --> 23:36.119
- Other news outlets. Twitter.
- Twitter!

23:36.120 --> 23:38.256
You can find anything you like on
Twitter.

23:38.257 --> 23:40.376
Monkeys on typewriters.

23:40.377 --> 23:42.319
If you keep pushing it,
you're going to seem...

23:42.320 --> 23:45.719
Consistent. Unapologetic.
Like we've got clout

23:45.720 --> 23:48.439
and don't submit to
the whims of the public.

23:48.440 --> 23:49.904
I was going to say you'll look

23:49.929 --> 23:50.880
- arrogant.
- I think

23:50.881 --> 23:53.199
I've had enough of your
constructive criticism.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.637
I'm sorry, but I think she's right.

23:54.662 --> 23:56.279
I... I do... We have to acknowledge it!

23:56.280 --> 23:57.519
And do what?!

23:57.520 --> 24:00.159
An apology to our readers?!

24:00.160 --> 24:04.079
"Oh, I'm really sorry. I think
we might have killed this boy."

24:04.080 --> 24:07.119
He was trouble.
And he was alerted to the extent

24:07.120 --> 24:10.039
of what he'd done, and felt guilty
about it. What do you think?

24:10.040 --> 24:12.479
- You wrote it.
- Er...

24:12.480 --> 24:14.639
Well, I think we stick to the line.

24:14.640 --> 24:16.079
Like you said.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.360
Bad karma.

24:17.980 --> 24:19.380
And you.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.320
Actually, mate,
I think she's got a point.

24:23.632 --> 24:24.832
She's got a point.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.040
Yeah.

24:27.540 --> 24:31.279
Well. You'll be pleased to hear
your collective opinion is noted,

24:31.280 --> 24:32.549
and rejected.

24:32.550 --> 24:34.559
So do what I am telling you,

24:34.560 --> 24:37.343
or there will be an Afternoon
of the Long Knives

24:37.368 --> 24:39.184
and I will stab the lot of you.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.360
Get the fuck on with it!

24:44.520 --> 24:46.180
Hi, kids, how's it going?

24:57.560 --> 24:59.120
Everything all right?

24:59.486 --> 25:00.926
Er, yeah, it's fine.

25:10.560 --> 25:11.720
Hey. Five minutes.

25:21.680 --> 25:25.399
Er, when he slams his door, it's a
sign he wants to be left on his own.

25:25.400 --> 25:26.999
Yeah. This is important.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.779
No. Seriously.

25:28.780 --> 25:29.879
You should leave it.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.999
What's the worst he can do? Let you
go? Fine, you work somewhere else.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.320
The worst?

25:35.480 --> 25:39.279
There was a reporter here who started
leaking stories to other papers.

25:39.280 --> 25:42.999
When Duncan found out, he put the
reporter's mam on the front page.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.119
Labelled her "benefit scum".

25:46.120 --> 25:49.360
He thinks I'm stupid.
That's what I want him to think.

25:51.100 --> 25:53.559
Maybe give him a few minutes.

25:53.560 --> 25:54.960
All right. Thanks.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.159
No, no-no-no, no.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.759
I need to solve a problem,
and you won't help.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.519
You need to demonstrate some compassion.

26:09.520 --> 26:12.600
Maybe I need to demonstrate you
the door again.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.719
When you froze in there,
you asked how old the boy was.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.119
That camera means something to you.

26:25.120 --> 26:26.680
Is it for your son?

26:27.100 --> 26:28.519
Something's distracting you today.

26:28.520 --> 26:32.040
I thought I hired a journalist,
I got a psychiatrist.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.960
It's his birthday, right,
and you can't see him cos you've...

26:35.180 --> 26:36.680
split up with your wife.

26:37.720 --> 26:39.039
Do you really wanna know?

26:39.040 --> 26:41.640
I'm interested in
what's making you unhappy, yeah.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.800
Everyone else is too scared to ask.

26:46.040 --> 26:48.119
She's sleeping with a billionaire banker.

26:48.120 --> 26:49.440
They've hired lawyers to cut me out.

26:49.465 --> 26:50.599
Why?

26:50.600 --> 26:52.160
I imagine because I'm a bad influence.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.600
You can't even give him a present?

26:57.200 --> 27:00.222
No-one tells you the truth here,
do you realise that?

27:00.223 --> 27:01.549
They're all so petrified of you,

27:01.574 --> 27:03.039
they just tell you what you want to hear.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.920
And that works fine for me.

27:06.120 --> 27:08.239
Adnan Homsi's here. You need to see him.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.479
I've got a bigger problem.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.239
Then fix it.

27:11.240 --> 27:13.217
And how do you suggest that I do that?

27:13.242 --> 27:14.334
I told you.

27:14.335 --> 27:16.999
- Compassion.
- Apologising would be a mistake.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.199
Of course, so don't.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.959
- You know what to do.
- Do I? Enlighten me.

27:20.960 --> 27:22.199
Say he's a victim.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.439
That it wasn't the print media
that did this, it was the public.

27:24.440 --> 27:27.370
Like you said, you can find anything
on Twitter, so find a load of hate

27:27.371 --> 27:29.429
that's been thrown at him
in the last 24 hours

27:29.430 --> 27:32.395
and stick it on the front page.
Make the trolls the enemy

27:32.396 --> 27:33.615
and the Post the solution -

27:33.616 --> 27:36.119
an anti-bullying campaign, slogans,
I don't know,

27:36.120 --> 27:38.626
a T-shirt. A complete contradiction
with what you did yesterday,

27:38.627 --> 27:40.844
but do it loud enough
and no-one will notice.

27:40.845 --> 27:42.200
Reverse ferret.

27:42.660 --> 27:43.759
Right.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.520
That's what they call it on Fleet Street.

27:46.020 --> 27:47.919
- Yeah.
- You head so hard

27:47.920 --> 27:49.540
in the opposite direction
that everyone's so confused,

27:49.565 --> 27:50.584
they don't notice.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.879
You're starting to earn your money.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.679
OK, so sort that out, and then see
Adnan. He's waiting.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.440
Yeah. Yeah. In a second.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.240
Yes?

28:04.022 --> 28:05.221
Change of plan.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.879
We're doing an anti-bullying campaign,

28:07.880 --> 28:09.399
and I want the boy's parents.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.399
- Danny?
- He only had his mum.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.559
Danny's mum, yeah,

28:12.560 --> 28:13.800
- get her here.
- His mum?

28:15.120 --> 28:17.359
Yeah. I don't care how you get her,

28:17.360 --> 28:20.959
but she needs to be endorsing
our campaign in two hours.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.079
Not enough time to get her here.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.999
Well then get a picture
and a statement, or a video.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.039
Video's better. Get her on Skype,
FaceTime, whatever.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.399
- Video conference, record it.
- That's going to be hard.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.559
I want to hear "no problem".

28:33.560 --> 28:35.679
You don't care how I do it?

28:35.680 --> 28:36.580
No.

28:37.900 --> 28:39.480
All right, then. No problem.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.640
Hey, it's me.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.720
Yeah, I need a phone number.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.620
Er, landline and mobile,
and I need it right now.

28:57.160 --> 29:00.540
Er, anyone associated with
the Lyons family...

29:01.840 --> 29:03.679
- Can I bring him to your office?
- Who?

29:03.680 --> 29:05.079
- Adnan.
- Not now!

29:05.080 --> 29:06.159
What? He's waiting!

29:06.160 --> 29:08.520
Don't worry about him,
do the thing I gave you.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.880
And that's a direct mobile?

29:18.946 --> 29:20.106
Amazing.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.119
Lucy, did you see the man we brought up?

29:26.120 --> 29:28.639
- He was waiting over there.
- Yeah, he just left.

29:28.640 --> 29:29.960
Shit.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.920
Adnan!

29:44.400 --> 29:46.199
Adnan, wait. I'm sorry.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.919
A new story broke,
everyone's focused on that.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.799
If you can wait half an hour...

29:49.800 --> 29:52.279
- No. I only have an hour off my work.
- OK, five minutes.

29:52.280 --> 29:53.359
Five minutes and I'll try and...

29:53.360 --> 29:55.600
Is it important to him, you know,
what happened to me?

29:56.600 --> 29:58.119
It...

29:58.120 --> 30:00.279
It's just how a paper works.

30:00.280 --> 30:01.759
There's a lot of competing stories.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.443
Why does he have to see me himself?

30:05.280 --> 30:07.239
It's a lot of money
for a story like this.

30:07.240 --> 30:10.039
I've only just started,
I haven't built up the trust yet.

30:10.040 --> 30:13.479
I saw 93 men, women
and children slaughtered,

30:13.480 --> 30:14.679
and then thrown into a pit.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.319
I stood there
and didn't do anything about it.

30:17.320 --> 30:19.199
I couldn't do anything about it.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.399
I know where they are,

30:20.400 --> 30:22.599
and I want someone to go out there,

30:22.600 --> 30:26.160
dig up their bodies and give them to
whatever family that is left.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.040
Do you think that's important?

30:29.920 --> 30:31.199
Of course.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.600
It's worth the money, huh?

30:33.220 --> 30:34.260
Yeah.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.800
Do you know how I know it was 93?

30:39.320 --> 30:40.599
I counted.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.280
It was all I could do.

30:42.740 --> 30:45.440
You know, at least try to remember
how many there were.

30:46.680 --> 30:48.040
Adnan.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.480
We will do this.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.040
But not today.

30:52.200 --> 30:55.799
What, is this other story more
important than mine? Or is it...

30:55.800 --> 30:58.119
Is it just closer to home?

31:01.800 --> 31:03.200
I have to work.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.480
I'll keep trying.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.999
Hi, Mrs Lyons. I'm fully aware of
what a difficult time this is

31:24.000 --> 31:27.479
and your feelings about
the Post's headline,

31:27.480 --> 31:30.400
but this is a chance
to save your son's reputation.

31:31.060 --> 31:32.840
Yeah, it's all right,
it's all right. Take your time.

31:44.280 --> 31:47.011
No, I know he was a victim of
circumstance himself.

31:47.012 --> 31:49.759
That's why I want you
to take part in our campaign.

31:49.760 --> 31:52.900
Let's make him a hero, together.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.119
I think it might be good for you too.

31:56.120 --> 31:59.439
You know, we'd look after you,
arrange everything, and...

31:59.440 --> 32:02.959
if you were able to record
a short message for us,

32:02.960 --> 32:06.240
maybe we can find a way to
contribute towards Danny's funeral.

32:07.320 --> 32:10.120
Something extra for you
at this difficult time.

32:12.100 --> 32:14.319
Your idea, you see.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.919
You're good here.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.799
I knew you would be, you're a natural.

32:17.800 --> 32:20.279
H-How much would cover your needs?

32:20.280 --> 32:21.400
2,000?

32:23.440 --> 32:24.839
Four!

32:24.840 --> 32:27.799
I didn't realise you'd call his mum.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.520
Oh, no half-measures.

32:30.800 --> 32:32.359
Adnan's gone.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.559
- So?
- He was waiting, and...

32:34.560 --> 32:39.279
So Freddie... So Freddie's mum
got him a mobile.

32:39.280 --> 32:42.008
Right? But she doesn't know
that I've got the number,

32:42.009 --> 32:46.039
so I could call him directly
to say happy birthday.

32:46.040 --> 32:47.559
What do you think?

32:47.560 --> 32:49.959
You said you were interested.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.279
It might cause problems
if his mum heard it.

32:52.280 --> 32:55.319
It might make everything worse.
But what do you think?

32:55.320 --> 32:56.679
Should I call him?

32:56.680 --> 32:59.397
Adnan's had to go to work.
We took too long.

32:59.398 --> 33:02.279
- Yeah, forget about him now.
- We've lost his trust!

33:02.280 --> 33:04.800
Well, that's your problem.
Can you help me with mine?

33:05.460 --> 33:07.320
Why would I do that?

33:11.860 --> 33:16.239
Well, look... You know what?
How about we say 5,000?

33:16.240 --> 33:17.319
Yeah?

33:17.320 --> 33:18.480
Excellent.

33:18.481 --> 33:19.994
Well, look, there should be
someone at your front door

33:20.019 --> 33:21.280
right now with an iPad.

33:21.800 --> 33:25.039
They'll set it up
and give you some instructions.

33:25.040 --> 33:28.560
Yeah, that's them. Yeah, if you can
just go and answer the door.

33:28.986 --> 33:30.426
Great.

33:30.455 --> 33:31.655
All right.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.440
All right, thank you.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.160
What?

33:36.240 --> 33:37.480
Are you learning a lot?

33:38.180 --> 33:39.440
Yeah.

33:41.126 --> 33:42.606
Come on.

33:46.240 --> 33:51.279
You know what? Actually, at least
I'm committed to something.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.564
Yeah, there are things the Post do
that feel bad,

33:53.565 --> 33:56.559
and-and-and sometimes
we're not proud of the means,

33:56.560 --> 33:59.319
but ultimately we do better news
to more people

33:59.320 --> 34:01.959
than anything at the Herald,
and we're funny at the same time.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.439
There's nothing wrong with that.

34:03.440 --> 34:04.999
So you're proud of this?

34:05.000 --> 34:06.359
Yeah, I am.

34:06.360 --> 34:08.239
Are you gonna tell your mum about it?

34:18.040 --> 34:19.319
Yeah, that's good.

34:19.320 --> 34:20.918
That's really good, Kate.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.719
Thank you. Nice work.

34:22.719 --> 34:23.839
Thank you.

34:23.840 --> 34:25.360
Oh!

34:26.920 --> 34:29.020
Right, we're on.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.359
Mrs Lyons.

34:47.360 --> 34:49.080
Mrs... Mrs Lyons?

34:49.940 --> 34:52.998
Sorry. Sorry, Mrs Lyons,
we're having trouble hearing you.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.399
Mrs Lyons? This is Duncan Allen,
editor at the Post.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.391
If you... If you look at the
screen in front of you,

34:58.416 --> 34:59.900
you might be able to see me.

35:00.560 --> 35:04.519
I'm so sorry for your loss.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.399
And I... Can she hear me?

35:06.400 --> 35:07.679
Yeah, should be able to.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.039
Mrs Lyons?

35:09.040 --> 35:10.559
Ah.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.519
I'm so sorry for your loss.

35:12.520 --> 35:16.800
I'm very pleased that you feel able
to help us with this campaign.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.679
Now, it would be great if you could

35:21.680 --> 35:24.199
say something like
what's on the paper there.

35:24.200 --> 35:27.199
And if you try to memorise it,
get familiar with it,

35:27.200 --> 35:29.399
it's better if doesn't sound like
you're reading.

35:29.400 --> 35:30.440
OK?

35:31.760 --> 35:32.959
Yeah.

35:32.960 --> 35:35.620
She needs to speak up.
She needs to be louder.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.959
I don't approve of what you did.

35:43.960 --> 35:47.479
Er, having trouble hearing you,
Mrs Lyons. Sorry.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.400
I want Danny to be remembered.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.479
He's a victim too.

35:52.480 --> 35:55.320
Yeah, exactly, that's how we all feel.

35:55.846 --> 35:57.286
He's not a monster.

35:58.140 --> 36:00.160
I understand. Of course.

36:06.780 --> 36:09.319
Are we... Are we ready? Are we...?

36:09.320 --> 36:11.040
- Can we go?
- Is she ready?

36:17.940 --> 36:19.919
I just heard this was your idea.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.559
- What?
- The reversal.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.240
To reposition us.

36:25.757 --> 36:27.440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.840
And now I get it.

36:31.420 --> 36:33.960
You're not here
because he wants to sleep with you.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.480
It's cos he wants to groom you.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.940
You're just as ruthless as him.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.320
She looks like my mum.

36:56.814 --> 36:57.839
What?

36:57.840 --> 36:59.240
The day my dad died.

37:00.480 --> 37:03.100
She came into school to tell me,
and she looked just like that.

37:06.720 --> 37:09.160
Like she had no idea what was going on.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.840
My son was a bully.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.240
But he was also a victim of bullying.

37:28.120 --> 37:31.320
That's why I want to support
the Post's new campaign -

37:32.900 --> 37:35.200
Bully For No-One.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.400
He's right.

37:42.060 --> 37:43.599
I am ruthless.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.719
What you doing?!

38:02.720 --> 38:04.360
Slow down!

38:07.440 --> 38:09.399
Oh! I thought you'd left.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.159
I have.

38:11.160 --> 38:13.679
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I don't know what you mean.

38:13.680 --> 38:16.319
Well, I didn't even know
you owned a skirt look, oh!

38:16.320 --> 38:17.839
- Jesus!
- What? I'm joking!

38:17.840 --> 38:19.319
I'm dressed like this
cos I've got a new job.

38:19.320 --> 38:20.640
Where?

38:22.360 --> 38:24.639
Oh, Holly, no!

38:24.640 --> 38:27.180
Oh, no way! Come on!

38:40.840 --> 38:42.199
I just saw Holly.

38:42.200 --> 38:44.599
- Where? At your house?
- No, in the square.

38:44.600 --> 38:47.119
- Literally just now.
- Does she want her old job back?

38:47.120 --> 38:48.159
No.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.759
She's working at the Post.

38:49.760 --> 38:50.839
What?

38:50.840 --> 38:52.239
Are you joking?

38:52.240 --> 38:53.759
Conference!

38:53.760 --> 38:54.941
So we'll keep pushing,

38:54.966 --> 38:57.999
and we'll print something
when you've got it. OK? Next.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.519
Er, yes.

38:59.520 --> 39:00.640
Er...

39:02.420 --> 39:03.559
Take your time.

39:03.560 --> 39:07.399
The cashless society.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.519
It's everywhere today.

39:08.520 --> 39:10.159
- Not interesting.
- I was thinking about

39:10.160 --> 39:11.519
doing an in-depth piece, actually.

39:11.520 --> 39:13.439
It's a non-issue. People don't use cash,

39:13.440 --> 39:14.999
- they haven't for years.
- I do.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.560
- Yeah, well...
- What?

39:18.120 --> 39:19.588
- What?
- Well, I mean,

39:19.589 --> 39:22.959
- you're not exactly tech-savvy.
- Sure, but I do have a credit card.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.239
Do you pay for things with your phone?

39:24.240 --> 39:25.926
I call up John Lewis sometimes...

39:25.927 --> 39:27.119
Not what I meant.

39:27.120 --> 39:28.479
Sorry, can I ask a question?

39:28.480 --> 39:30.639
How many of you bought
the print edition last year?

39:30.640 --> 39:31.840
Put your hand up.

39:33.400 --> 39:34.639
Right.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.879
Do the longer piece, but focus on

39:36.880 --> 39:38.719
the information they get
from our actions.

39:38.720 --> 39:40.924
- The intrusion, not the nostalgia.
- OK, sure.

39:40.925 --> 39:44.199
Shouldn't we also do a piece on
the people who actually use cash

39:44.200 --> 39:45.479
- and for what purpose?
- Sure, that's good.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.399
- I thought you just said...
- I changed my mind.

39:47.400 --> 39:48.893
- Hard to keep up. Do both.

39:48.894 --> 39:50.479
Next.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.160
- Next?
- Sorry, one minute.

39:52.820 --> 39:54.559
While we're waiting,

39:54.560 --> 39:56.780
I assume all of you can get
the paper here for free,

39:56.805 --> 39:58.119
so how many of you know someone

39:58.120 --> 40:00.840
who actually buys the print edition
regularly?

40:01.180 --> 40:02.399
Yeah, not many.

40:02.400 --> 40:06.359
And that makes sense,
cos we only sell 160,000 nationally.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.319
And it costs £2.

40:08.320 --> 40:11.119
£2 for 30 cheap pages.

40:11.120 --> 40:12.519
That's a lot for most people.

40:12.520 --> 40:13.559
OK.

40:13.560 --> 40:15.119
Craig!

40:15.120 --> 40:17.319
- That means carry on.
- Er...

40:17.320 --> 40:20.199
- Do you want me to start?
- Danny Lyons.

40:20.200 --> 40:23.039
I think we covered him pretty
comprehensively yesterday, right?

40:23.040 --> 40:24.239
But if there's any developments,

40:24.240 --> 40:26.080
- we can address...
- Nope.

40:27.560 --> 40:30.879
Sorry, Leona. Sorry, last thing.
Despite not reading it,

40:30.880 --> 40:32.559
or knowing anyone who reads it,

40:32.560 --> 40:35.000
who would miss the print edition
if it stopped?

40:37.120 --> 40:38.399
And there's the problem.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.679
Amina, I think we should...
WHISTLES ...stay.

40:40.680 --> 40:42.399
Yes, sorry. Please.

40:42.400 --> 40:45.079
Harry! Sport.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.799
Er, we're leading on the shock
resignation of Jessie Cox

40:47.800 --> 40:51.480
from Rangers last night.

40:52.760 --> 40:56.279
What... was... that?

40:56.280 --> 40:57.840
Just laying the groundwork.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.479
So, Holly... Oh! She's not there.

41:01.480 --> 41:03.253
Did you hear Holly's started at the Post?

41:03.254 --> 41:05.079
What? No way!

41:05.080 --> 41:06.799
- Why?
- I don't know.

41:06.800 --> 41:09.559
Well, I assume they're paying her
a lot of money. She's a talent.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.719
- Yeah, but her, of all people?
- Good luck to her.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.320
You all ready for this afternoon?

41:13.900 --> 41:15.079
Yes.

41:15.080 --> 41:17.280
- Big day.
- For you too.

41:17.860 --> 41:19.599
Like the jacket.

41:19.600 --> 41:20.940
Thank you.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.920
No, it's nice. No, it's good.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.679
Did I tell you I saw the Board yesterday?

41:30.680 --> 41:33.013
They've had the sign-off
from legal, commercial.

41:33.014 --> 41:34.920
- Full backing.
- That's good.

41:39.027 --> 41:40.467
What's the matter?

41:44.840 --> 41:46.924
I spoke to Susie last night.

41:47.458 --> 41:48.990
I assume you speak to her most nights.

41:48.991 --> 41:50.280
I told her.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.260
Oh.

41:56.026 --> 41:57.626
Oh, yeah.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.440
EXHALES She was so...

42:03.252 --> 42:04.652
...calm.

42:06.200 --> 42:07.920
Freaked me out, actually.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.039
We had dinner and we talked.

42:11.040 --> 42:13.719
We talked all night,
and went through everything.

42:13.720 --> 42:15.479
She says she wants to keep trying

42:15.480 --> 42:17.479
because of the children.

42:17.480 --> 42:19.279
She said she still loves me.

42:19.280 --> 42:20.519
And what did you say?

42:20.520 --> 42:22.840
I said I wanted to keep trying too.

42:24.840 --> 42:26.399
You still love her, I'm sure.

42:26.400 --> 42:29.680
I promised her that nothing would
ever happen between us again.

42:31.500 --> 42:33.520
Because you still love her.

42:33.900 --> 42:35.199
I mean, you and me

42:35.200 --> 42:37.420
was just something we needed to
get out of our systems.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.060
I don't want to lose my family.

42:41.580 --> 42:42.799
Right.

42:42.800 --> 42:45.319
Cos... she's the one.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.340
Not me. You love her.

42:48.900 --> 42:49.919
Yeah.

42:49.920 --> 42:51.679
I know. I knew that.

42:51.680 --> 42:53.839
- We both knew that.
- And with all the changes,

42:53.840 --> 42:56.559
with everything
that's happening in here today,

42:56.560 --> 42:58.479
you know, I wanted to
make sure that we were OK.

42:58.480 --> 43:00.999
Everyone's talking about us,
and it's not helpful.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.319
- Everyone's not talking about us.
- Yes, they are.

43:02.320 --> 43:03.839
There's even a name for it.

43:03.840 --> 43:06.120
- What?
- Pamina.

43:07.820 --> 43:09.720
- Pamina.
- Yeah.

43:10.100 --> 43:11.319
- Is that an opera reference?
- It's like a...

43:11.320 --> 43:12.742
It's a combination of Peter and Amina...

43:12.767 --> 43:14.199
Yeah, I know, but it's also a character

43:14.200 --> 43:16.319
- from The Magic Flute.
- Look, I don't know...

43:16.320 --> 43:17.999
Do you think our staff are that cultured?

43:18.000 --> 43:19.720
- I'd love to think so.
- Please.

43:22.340 --> 43:24.440
No, I get it, we're stopping.

43:33.520 --> 43:36.340
Yeah, OK.

43:38.840 --> 43:40.559
You ready for this afternoon?

43:40.560 --> 43:42.039
I think so.

43:42.040 --> 43:45.079
Leona's right,
got your special jacket on.

43:45.080 --> 43:46.679
Yeah, wanted to make an effort.

43:46.680 --> 43:47.840
Yeah.

44:04.680 --> 44:06.239
Attention, everybody.

44:06.240 --> 44:08.919
Attention, everyone. We've got a bit
of an announcement to make.

44:08.920 --> 44:11.719
If everyone could just head down
in this direction, please.

44:11.720 --> 44:14.160
In an orderly fashion, everybody.

44:20.760 --> 44:23.399
We're all passionate about
delivering our news

44:23.400 --> 44:26.359
to as many people as possible.

44:26.360 --> 44:28.544
But the truth is, our print edition

44:28.569 --> 44:31.039
barely reaches a dwindling readership.

44:31.040 --> 44:34.319
The website's well-attended,
but it's currently free of charge.

44:34.320 --> 44:37.079
We've tried to ask people
to donate voluntarily,

44:37.080 --> 44:39.840
but that hasn't been as successful
as we'd hoped.

44:40.420 --> 44:41.999
The culture's changing,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.500
and we are going to have to
change with it, quickly.

44:44.960 --> 44:46.520
So we're going to.

44:48.040 --> 44:53.140
In two weeks' time, the Herald
will become a free paper.

44:54.420 --> 44:57.079
It'll be distributed across the country,

44:57.080 --> 44:58.764
and our aim is to have a readership

44:58.789 --> 45:01.986
at least four times the current size.

45:01.987 --> 45:04.999
It'll be slimmed down,
and carry more advertising.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.719
The main news on the website
will continue to be free of charge,

45:07.720 --> 45:10.559
but for in-depth articles, people
are going to have to start to pay.

45:10.560 --> 45:14.879
We are aiming not to lose any staff
as we make this restructure,

45:14.880 --> 45:18.119
and if it goes well, we may even be
able to take on more people.

45:18.120 --> 45:22.799
Peter is going to be the day-to-day
editor of the new free Herald,

45:22.800 --> 45:26.799
and Leona is going to be his deputy.

45:26.800 --> 45:29.839
She is exactly what we need.
Herald through and through.

45:29.840 --> 45:33.039
Real energy, new ideas
and she'll keep Peter

45:33.040 --> 45:35.239
- in the 21st century.
- Well, she can try.

45:35.240 --> 45:37.639
I'll put all the details in an email

45:37.640 --> 45:40.999
so you can understand what it might
mean for you individually.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.879
I know it's a big change, for all of us.

45:44.880 --> 45:49.079
But it means that we won't just
survive, we will thrive.

45:49.080 --> 45:54.359
And many more different sorts of
people will get their news from us.

45:54.360 --> 45:59.320
If you've got any questions,
you know where to find us...

46:04.120 --> 46:05.480
Holly.

46:10.880 --> 46:13.240
Is that normal,
what happened with the mum?

46:15.640 --> 46:17.839
Er, it happens, yeah.

46:17.840 --> 46:19.119
Where's Holly gone?

46:19.120 --> 46:20.359
I don't know.

46:20.360 --> 46:21.999
She didn't seem to like it.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.919
Well, she's not a very good fit.

46:23.920 --> 46:25.480
I doubt she'll last the day.

46:27.493 --> 46:28.893
Do you want to get something to eat?

46:31.240 --> 46:33.480
Yeah, I'm not sure I'm a good fit either.

46:34.100 --> 46:35.159
What?

46:35.160 --> 46:37.439
That story they found on his computer,

46:37.440 --> 46:39.439
that Danny Lyons was looking at.

46:39.440 --> 46:40.720
You wrote that.

46:41.960 --> 46:45.000
- Yeah, I did.
- Calling him a monster?

46:45.380 --> 46:47.559
The headline was picked by
the back bench.

46:47.560 --> 46:49.559
But it says monster in the article,
I read it.

46:49.560 --> 46:51.959
He... He put other kids in hospital.

46:51.960 --> 46:53.200
Yeah.

46:54.640 --> 46:57.119
I might speak to Raz,
if that's all right?

46:57.120 --> 46:59.880
It's been great working with you,
but I might actually head off.

47:01.680 --> 47:03.199
I'm not sure this is for me.

47:07.960 --> 47:09.679
If Danny Lyons was normal,

47:09.680 --> 47:11.519
he wouldn't have hospitalised
three children.

47:11.520 --> 47:13.940
What I wrote didn't kill him.
He did that himself.

47:14.440 --> 47:17.400
You want to spend some time
with the pictures desk.

47:17.700 --> 47:23.079
You know, some of the stuff they see
from murder scenes and war zones.

47:23.080 --> 47:24.719
So much you can't even print.

47:24.720 --> 47:26.202
We tell people what's going on,

47:26.203 --> 47:28.879
but we can only do that
if we get their attention first.

47:28.880 --> 47:30.200
This is the real world.

47:31.200 --> 47:32.359
You don't like it?

47:32.360 --> 47:33.560
No.

47:33.940 --> 47:35.800
Then you're right. You should go home.

47:44.693 --> 47:45.853
What?

47:56.406 --> 47:57.486
Lucy?

47:58.460 --> 47:59.400
Where's Holly?

47:59.401 --> 48:00.760
Er, I don't know.

48:16.032 --> 48:18.711
_

48:38.803 --> 48:40.803
_

48:51.440 --> 48:53.060
Lucy!

48:55.340 --> 48:58.119
That man - the man that Holly brought in.

48:58.120 --> 49:00.079
- Did we get his details?
- He left.

49:00.080 --> 49:02.959
Yeah, I know, but did we get
his name, phone number,

49:02.960 --> 49:04.720
- where he lived...?
- Holly had them, I think?

49:05.840 --> 49:07.199
Holly's gone.

49:07.200 --> 49:08.140
She's...

49:08.960 --> 49:11.199
Well, then no. Sorry.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.760
Fine.

49:22.360 --> 49:23.839
Lucy?

49:23.840 --> 49:25.199
Yeah?

49:25.200 --> 49:26.880
Can you wrap this?

49:27.286 --> 49:28.726
No problem.

49:44.880 --> 49:46.223
They caused the boy's death.

49:46.224 --> 49:48.130
They offered his mother money
to cover themselves

49:48.131 --> 49:51.639
and then they all stood around and
forced her to record that message.

49:51.640 --> 49:53.319
The piece would expose all of it.

49:53.320 --> 49:56.439
How they operate, and, at the
centre of it, that horrific man.

49:56.440 --> 49:58.679
He even has a safe where he keeps
stories in case he needs them

49:58.680 --> 50:00.279
for blackmail or intimidation.

50:00.280 --> 50:01.799
- Did you see it?
- Yeah, he gave me

50:01.800 --> 50:03.519
something from it to look at.

50:03.520 --> 50:05.840
It would compromise
the Prime Minister, apparently.

50:06.340 --> 50:08.909
I want to write about the Post
for tonight's edition, all of it.

50:08.910 --> 50:10.382
So that people remember Danny Lyons

50:10.383 --> 50:12.640
and they understand what they did to him.

50:13.020 --> 50:15.680
You're saying you want to come back?

50:17.240 --> 50:19.080
Not to my old job.

50:19.460 --> 50:20.920
I...

50:21.300 --> 50:22.680
I want to be a reporter.

50:23.060 --> 50:24.079
That's all.

50:26.240 --> 50:28.199
You said a lot of things
when you walked out.

50:28.200 --> 50:30.959
- I know, look...
- That we were ignoring the problems,

50:30.960 --> 50:34.239
that if we didn't do something,
in a year, we'd be finished.

50:34.240 --> 50:35.799
Yeah. I was upset.

50:35.800 --> 50:39.319
You were right. Did you hear
what we were saying out there?

50:39.320 --> 50:41.039
- Most of it.
- There were problems,

50:41.040 --> 50:43.840
we weren't addressing them.
But now we are.

50:45.660 --> 50:46.799
As we're restructuring,

50:46.800 --> 50:48.840
I think it's a good time
to take people on.

50:51.360 --> 50:52.959
You should have always been writing.

50:52.960 --> 50:56.180
Say what you like about Duncan,
but he spotted it a while ago.

50:56.680 --> 50:58.279
We will pay you a retainer.

50:58.280 --> 51:02.199
You'll have work hard for it,
but all you do is report, write.

51:02.200 --> 51:03.500
Yeah.

51:03.920 --> 51:06.194
I ask one thing back. You have to accept

51:06.195 --> 51:07.480
that I'm your editor-in-chief.

51:08.060 --> 51:10.700
Ultimately, what I say is what happens.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.880
I'm sorry I went.

51:13.620 --> 51:15.440
Yeah, I was sorry, too.

51:15.860 --> 51:17.280
Yeah.

51:17.580 --> 51:21.039
Go on, then. Go and... work on
this story.

51:21.040 --> 51:23.039
Yeah, can I have an advance?

51:23.040 --> 51:24.107
Why?

51:24.108 --> 51:25.599
5,000.

51:25.600 --> 51:26.999
There's summat that I've got to sort out.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.477
5,000 of your salary?

51:28.478 --> 51:30.240
Yeah.

51:32.120 --> 51:33.479
All right.

51:33.480 --> 51:35.420
OK. Thanks.

51:36.113 --> 51:39.873
What was the story from the safe
that he wanted you to cover?

51:39.960 --> 51:41.439
I-I-I don't know.

51:41.440 --> 51:43.160
All it said was "Resonance".

51:43.500 --> 51:44.599
He thought it was...

51:44.600 --> 51:46.359
- Resonance?
- Yeah, he thought it was

51:46.360 --> 51:48.519
connected to MI5 or...?

51:48.520 --> 51:50.000
Hang on.

51:53.079 --> 51:54.679
James!

51:57.400 --> 52:01.159
Months ago, remember that man came
forward, said he worked for MI5?

52:01.160 --> 52:03.199
- Have I done something wrong?
- What was the name

52:03.200 --> 52:04.719
of the programme he told you about?

52:04.720 --> 52:06.040
Er, Resonance.

52:08.320 --> 52:09.359
Oh, what, what have I done?

52:09.360 --> 52:11.663
Holly, we're going to have to hold
that story on the Post.

52:11.664 --> 52:14.300
James, come in, shut the door.
We're going to have to talk.

52:20.480 --> 52:21.639
Yes?

52:21.640 --> 52:23.359
It's Duncan Allen.

52:23.360 --> 52:25.000
Oh, Jesus.

52:25.380 --> 52:28.160
I've got a present for Freddie.
Can I give it to him?

52:31.179 --> 52:32.739
Hello?

52:41.900 --> 52:42.760
Who are you?

52:42.761 --> 52:44.039
His assistant.

52:44.040 --> 52:45.679
He said you had something to deliver?

52:45.680 --> 52:48.319
Well, I want to deliver it myself.

52:48.320 --> 52:49.759
That's not possible.

52:49.760 --> 52:51.399
Whoa, be careful!

52:51.400 --> 52:54.399
It's... It's a bit fragile.

53:58.546 --> 54:00.706
I'm sorry that it's late.

54:02.540 --> 54:04.839
The Herald want to tell your story.

54:04.840 --> 54:06.479
You said the Herald doesn't pay.

54:06.480 --> 54:08.240
They don't. But I will.

54:09.900 --> 54:16.480
Here's 100 for goodwill and to say
sorry about this afternoon.

54:23.258 --> 54:24.279
You should call me.

54:24.280 --> 54:26.040
We can meet tomorrow lunchtime,
make a start.

54:26.380 --> 54:28.040
Back at the Herald now, huh?

54:28.420 --> 54:29.600
Yeah.

54:30.880 --> 54:32.040
For good?

54:33.720 --> 54:34.840
Yeah.

54:36.160 --> 54:37.720
Good.

55:01.172 --> 55:02.620
Thank you.

56:30.380 --> 56:32.839
The Herald has got something.

56:32.840 --> 56:35.199
- What's the story?
- Resonance.

56:35.200 --> 56:36.901
In the whole time that I have been
at the Herald, there has never been

56:36.902 --> 56:39.839
- a story as important as this.
- If we allow this to carry on,

56:39.840 --> 56:42.018
it's the complete end of society
as we know it.

56:42.019 --> 56:44.159
- Stop them printing it.
- It's not my job

56:44.160 --> 56:46.999
to shut down stories in other newspapers.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.879
I'm thinking maybe you're in decline.

56:48.880 --> 56:51.199
I've told him we're going to stop
him from seeing Fred.

56:51.200 --> 56:52.200
You won't.

56:52.201 --> 56:53.579
It's about Resonance.

56:53.580 --> 56:55.119
That's the sort of journalist
you want to be?

56:55.120 --> 56:56.399
I get the story.

56:56.400 --> 56:58.119
Turns out you're a bit of a shit,
really, aren't you?

56:58.120 --> 56:59.799
You want to talk, let's talk.

56:59.800 --> 57:01.119
You're my next story.

57:01.120 --> 57:02.479
Write what you like.

57:02.480 --> 57:03.760
I dare you.
