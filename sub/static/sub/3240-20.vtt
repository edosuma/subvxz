was made antemortem.

10:33.367 --> 10:34.866
Hanson found his address
in queens.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.001
You up for a field trip?

10:36.003 --> 10:37.869
Yes.
Lucas...

10:37.871 --> 10:41.473
Let me know when the tox report
comes back from the lab.

10:41.475 --> 10:42.540
Will do.

10:42.542 --> 10:46.544
[ woman speaking indistinctly
on p.A. ]

10:49.016 --> 10:50.649
Ah, lucas!

10:50.651 --> 10:53.251
If you're looking for henry,
you just missed him.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.253
Nope, you're
the one i wanted.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.321
I have a little favor to ask.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.522
Uh, it's about a woman --

10:57.524 --> 11:00.158
Oh, trouble with the ladies,
huh?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.093
Well, fear not.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.695
You've come
to the right place.

11:03.697 --> 11:04.863
I-i-it's my mother.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.031
Oh.
Yeah.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.233
See, she left my pops
'round 1985.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.435
And after that, she just
kind of vanished.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.970
Now, i think
i might have found

11:11.972 --> 11:13.304
The hospital
that she worked at.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.040
But the schmucks
at the records office

11:15.042 --> 11:16.441
Won't release
her employment files

11:16.443 --> 11:18.510
Unless someone from
the o.C.M.E. Requests it.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.412
So, that's...
Where you come in.

11:20.414 --> 11:21.780
Well, why don't you
ask henry?

11:21.782 --> 11:24.115
I mean, missing-persons case,
hidden files --

11:24.117 --> 11:25.850
Sounds like a rocking
saturday night for him.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.052
Oh, i forgot to mention --

11:27.054 --> 11:28.253
Henry must not know
about this,

11:28.255 --> 11:31.189
Because, um,
when my mother went missing,

11:31.191 --> 11:34.259
Things got kind of dark, uh,
for me, that is.

11:34.261 --> 11:35.894
I just don't want
to worry him.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.495
Right. Uh...

11:37.497 --> 11:38.897
It's just...

11:38.899 --> 11:40.231
I want to help you,

11:40.233 --> 11:43.435
But i have a lot of trouble
keeping secrets

11:43.437 --> 11:45.403
With henry,
because he sort of plays

11:45.405 --> 11:46.771
Those jedi mind tricks.

11:46.773 --> 11:48.073
I'm sure you've felt them.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.041
Yeah, i know it's
a lot to ask.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.010
But, um, henry just always

11:52.012 --> 11:55.013
[clears throat] speaks so
highly about -- about you.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.215
Calls you
his right-hand man.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.349
Henry says that?

11:58.351 --> 12:00.919
O-of course -- course
he says that.

12:00.921 --> 12:01.920
Look, i, uh...

12:01.922 --> 12:03.188
[ clears throat ]

12:03.190 --> 12:04.689
Yeah, i can make
some calls for you.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.224
Uh, what --
what's her name?

12:06.226 --> 12:07.325
Well,
she's had a few.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.461
Karen jones, alice smith.

12:09.463 --> 12:13.164
Wait, what do you mean,
like aliases?

12:13.166 --> 12:15.166
Does this have something
to do with your dad?

12:15.168 --> 12:17.702
It's a long story.

12:18.472 --> 12:21.339
Jo: When did you first
realize eva was missing?

12:21.341 --> 12:23.441
She was supposed
to meet me for lunch

12:23.443 --> 12:25.210
At the restaurant
where i work.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.745
But she never came.

12:26.747 --> 12:29.948
I tried to tell the cops
that she was in danger,

12:29.950 --> 12:32.383
That -- that someone from the
ballet had been following her.

12:32.385 --> 12:35.086
Wait, you're saying
eva had a stalker?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.521
Did she say who it was?

12:36.523 --> 12:38.156
Oh, no.
She -- she didn't say.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.358
She -- she said she
could handle it herself.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.127
By the looks of things,
she did.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.095
Eva was carrying a can

12:44.097 --> 12:45.497
Of pepper spray in her gym bag.

12:45.499 --> 12:47.499
It appears to be half empty.

12:47.501 --> 12:50.201
Perhaps she had a recent run-in
with her stalker.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.870
Is this eva's car?

12:51.872 --> 12:53.638
Yes.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.406
Was she driving it
the day she went missing?

12:55.408 --> 12:56.407
Yes.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.842
Henry, where are
you going with this?

12:57.844 --> 12:59.310
The carpet in cars nowadays

12:59.312 --> 13:00.912
Is made of synthetic materials,

13:00.914 --> 13:03.248
But the carpet in classic cars
is made

13:03.250 --> 13:05.216
Of 100% natural fiber,

13:05.218 --> 13:07.018
Like the wool we found
on eva's shoe.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.520
If we find that car --

13:08.522 --> 13:11.322
We may
find eva's body.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.359
Hanson: Parking authority
found it

13:14.361 --> 13:16.661
Abandoned this morning
on a curbside in the bronx.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.496
Interior appears to be clean,

13:18.498 --> 13:20.498
But check this out.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.401
Jo: Look at this
pool of blood.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.570
Henry: The stain
is too small.

13:25.572 --> 13:26.971
When eva's killer
cut her foot off,

13:26.973 --> 13:29.007
It would have been gushing
with blood, unless...

13:29.009 --> 13:30.508
Unless what?

13:30.510 --> 13:33.511
Unless she
stopped the bleeding.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.079
Eva's killer
put her in the trunk

13:35.081 --> 13:36.247
Believing that she was
either

13:36.249 --> 13:37.982
Unconscious
or perhaps even dead.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.185
But she was awake.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.786
[<i> screaming</i> ]

13:41.788 --> 13:42.987
[<i> sobbing</i> ]

13:42.989 --> 13:46.691
The rubber tubing
has been torn off this carpet.

13:46.693 --> 13:49.360
She must have ripped it out
to make a tourniquet.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.033
[<i> groans</i> ]

13:55.035 --> 13:57.569
Wait, doc,
are you saying --

13:57.571 --> 14:00.305
Our murder victim
might still be alive.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.980
Where are we
with suspects?

14:08.982 --> 14:10.949
Well, we're heading over
to stuhler center now.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.084
Eva's brother said
she was being stalked

14:13.086 --> 14:14.452
By someone at the ballet.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.787
Figure we head over there,

14:15.789 --> 14:17.288
Talk to some people,
see if we can flush 'em out.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.723
Good. In the meanwhile,

14:18.725 --> 14:20.291
State p.D. Is putting together
a search party,

14:20.293 --> 14:21.860
But they've got a lot
of ground to cover.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.329
It would be nice if they knew
exactly where to start.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.731
Well, henry's on it,
believe me.

14:28.869 --> 14:32.070
Dirt in her tires appears to be
a mixture of silt and clay.

14:33.306 --> 14:36.441
Grass under the tires seems to
be of the<i> paniculata</i> variety.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.775
Lucas: What exactly
does that mean?

14:37.777 --> 14:39.510
There must be something here
that can tell us

14:39.512 --> 14:41.479
Where eva's attacker
dumped her body.

14:41.481 --> 14:42.847
We only have
a few hours left.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.382
Time is of the essence!

14:44.384 --> 14:46.251
Woman:
Lucas, you got a minute?

14:46.253 --> 14:47.452
No!
No.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.821
Uh, a bunch a files
came for you

14:49.823 --> 14:51.589
From st. Timothy's
medical group.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.892
You have to sign for them.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.660
Medical files?
What are they about?

14:55.662 --> 14:57.896
Oh, that's, uh,
probably a mistake.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.631
T-they're not for me.
Anyway, i'll --

14:59.633 --> 15:01.566
I'll, uh,
i'll figure this out.

15:02.802 --> 15:06.471
Dmitry: It's a terrible thing
to lose a talent like eva.

15:06.473 --> 15:09.440
A director is lucky
if he sees a dancer like this

15:09.442 --> 15:12.410
Once, maybe, twice
in a lifetime.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.714
Everyone she worked with
adored her.

15:16.716 --> 15:19.517
Well, apparently
not everyone.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.420
We believe eva
may have had a stalker.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.155
Do you know of anyone
at the theater

15:24.157 --> 15:25.356
That may be jealous?

15:25.358 --> 15:27.058
There isn't a girl
in the company

15:27.060 --> 15:28.493
Who wasn't jealous of eva.

15:28.495 --> 15:31.095
She was replacing odessa kozlova
as the next prima.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.131
She was replacing odessa?

15:33.133 --> 15:34.799
We heard that odessa
was retiring.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.535
The injuries,
the -- the practice,

15:37.537 --> 15:39.837
They were beginning
to take its toll on odessa.

15:39.839 --> 15:41.806
The company
thought it would be best

15:41.808 --> 15:43.408
To pass the mantle on
to eva.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.543
How did odessa feel
about that?

15:45.545 --> 15:47.545
Well, she was upset,
naturally.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.547
But to think that she would do
something like this

15:49.549 --> 15:51.249
Is impossible.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.385
She was at rehearsal
the entire day eva went missing.

15:54.387 --> 15:58.723
Besides, i never heard her
threaten eva.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.925
They hardly even spoke.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.460
[ blows ]

16:03.296 --> 16:04.595
Looks like odessa found

16:04.597 --> 16:06.564
Another way
to get her message across.

16:06.566 --> 16:09.067
Did odessa have access
to this dressing room?

16:09.069 --> 16:10.535
Yes, she did.

16:13.707 --> 16:16.574
You think a prim little
ballet queen like odessa's

16:16.576 --> 16:18.443
Even got the power
to cut off a girl's foot?

16:18.445 --> 16:19.877
Well, every queen

16:19.879 --> 16:21.179
Has her henchmen.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.580
Russian mob,
by the looks of it.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.349
Jo: Check out
that one.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.917
His eyes are
almost swollen shut.

16:25.919 --> 16:27.452
Allergy season?

16:27.454 --> 16:29.687
No, pepper spray.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.356
Eva unloaded half a can
on the guy

16:31.358 --> 16:33.124
Who was supposedly
following her.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.794
No autographs.

16:36.796 --> 16:39.664
Oh, actually, we were
hoping for an interview.

16:43.003 --> 16:45.370
Odessa: You may call it
retirement.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.338
But when a ballet director
replaces you

16:47.340 --> 16:48.873
With some girl
from the slums

16:48.875 --> 16:50.641
Who can barely spin
on her toes.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.477
I call that an insult.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.879
Yeah, well,
i call it motive.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.314
Only a pretty girl
like you

16:56.316 --> 16:57.615
Didn't want to get
her hands dirty,

16:57.617 --> 16:59.384
So you went
to your pal sergei.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.487
Jo: Your record
is pretty impressive.

17:02.489 --> 17:06.057
Robbery, extortion,
aggravated assault.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.760
So, what the hell
is a thug like you doing

17:08.762 --> 17:10.862
Hanging out with
a bunch of ballerinas?

17:10.864 --> 17:13.398
My colleagues and i
are investors

17:13.400 --> 17:14.699
In odessa's career.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.368
We pay
for her dance coaches,

17:17.370 --> 17:18.503
Her living expenses --

17:18.505 --> 17:19.637
And in return, you take

17:19.639 --> 17:21.072
A portion of her earnings.

17:21.074 --> 17:24.242
<i>But all that money</i>
<i>was about to go away</i>

17:24.244 --> 17:26.611
<i>When eva took her job.</i>

17:26.613 --> 17:28.846
You chopped off eva's foot,

17:28.848 --> 17:31.149
And then you left it
at that ballet as a warning.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.683
I never touched eva!

17:32.685 --> 17:35.620
You got close enough
for her to pepper-spray you.

17:35.622 --> 17:38.022
You must have been following her
for a while,

17:38.024 --> 17:41.092
Waiting for that perfect
moment to kidnap her.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.127
Odessa: He was never
trying to kidnap her.

17:43.129 --> 17:44.662
He was only watching her.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.397
It's an old trick in russia.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.000
You hire a man
to follow from distance,

17:49.002 --> 17:50.501
Leave a few threats.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.504
Suddenly the dancer
gets distracted.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.974
I was just trying
to make eva slip up.

17:56.976 --> 17:59.577
<i>But i told sergei</i>
<i>never to touch her,</i>

17:59.579 --> 18:01.179
<i>Just to follow.</i>

18:01.181 --> 18:03.347
Jo:<i> Were you following her</i>
<i>the day she went missing?</i>

18:03.349 --> 18:04.449
<i>Yes.</i>

18:04.451 --> 18:06.951
She left rehearsal
around 3:00,

18:06.953 --> 18:10.154
Went to the courtyard,
hung around some statue,

18:10.156 --> 18:11.456
<i>And then she left.</i>

18:11.458 --> 18:12.990
Jo:<i> And you</i>
<i>didn't follow her?</i>

18:12.992 --> 18:15.093
She already pepper-sprayed
me once.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.562
I thought it best
to let her go.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.630
Besides, it was raining
outside.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.970
Hanson: Let me get this
straight, henry.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.772
You dragged us all the way
back out here

18:27.774 --> 18:30.241
Just because this cossack
meathead said it was raining?

18:30.243 --> 18:31.576
Henry: Don't you see?

18:31.578 --> 18:33.478
It was pouring
when eva left the studio,

18:33.480 --> 18:34.779
And yet she stood outside

18:34.781 --> 18:36.447
In front of this statue
for some time.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.849
Jo: Henry,
we still have two

18:37.851 --> 18:39.717
Perfectly good suspects
back at the station.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.486
Both have motive, both --

18:41.488 --> 18:42.720
Are innocent.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.422
Sergei and odessa
won't be able

18:44.424 --> 18:45.890
To tell us
where eva was going

18:45.892 --> 18:48.326
The afternoon she went missing
or who she was meeting.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.027
But this statue might.

18:50.029 --> 18:53.097
It's what the romans would call
a "talking statue."

18:53.099 --> 18:55.066
You see, in ancient rome,
young lovers

18:55.068 --> 18:57.101
Were forbidden from speaking
in public.

18:57.103 --> 18:59.737

would be necessary.

did this to her

33:05.451 --> 33:06.817
In my humble opinion,

33:06.819 --> 33:10.087
The single best thing to do
in paris is get lost.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.656
Yes.

33:12.658 --> 33:16.059

And get lost.

That you have no choice but
to stop at the nearest cafe

33:22.768 --> 33:24.901
And order something
wonderful to eat

33:24.903 --> 33:27.004
Along with a glass or two
of wine.

33:27.006 --> 33:29.339
And then set back out
into the city.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.041
And do it all over again.

that this regimen works best

Now.

early onset arthritis.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.791
She had a degenerative
bone condition.

I'd say she had about
a year of dancing left.
