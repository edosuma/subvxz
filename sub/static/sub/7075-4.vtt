00:04.480 --> 00:06.268
City college has a
space simulator.

00:06.269 --> 00:07.889
We know. Close the door.

00:07.890 --> 00:09.754
As I was saying...

00:09.755 --> 00:13.847
On Monday, city college
will be unveiling,

00:13.848 --> 00:15.907
the City College Cosmic Pioneer...

00:15.908 --> 00:18.724
their very own orbital
launch simulator.

00:18.725 --> 00:19.954
Pretty soon,

00:19.955 --> 00:23.548
they will have an astronaut
on their brochure,

00:23.549 --> 00:27.566
and we will still be bragging
about our foosball table.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.174
What do you think happens
to enrollment then?

00:32.988 --> 00:34.728
I don't know about you, gentlemen,

00:34.985 --> 00:37.468
but I love my campus,
and I don't want to watch it

00:37.469 --> 00:39.646
become a city college parking lot.

00:39.647 --> 00:41.114
Well, what can we do?

00:41.115 --> 00:44.295
We can launch our
own space simulator.

00:44.296 --> 00:46.763
Before they simulate
their launch on Monday,

00:46.764 --> 00:50.207
we simulate a launch this weekend.

00:50.208 --> 00:52.389
We make Greendale,
not city college,

00:52.390 --> 00:53.951
the first community college

00:53.952 --> 00:55.952
to pretend to put a man in space.

00:55.953 --> 00:57.535
Do we even have a simulator?

00:57.536 --> 00:58.806
We can get one.

00:59.147 --> 01:01.611
In 1980, the county museum

01:01.612 --> 01:04.777
had a state-of-the-art
space mission simulator

01:04.778 --> 01:06.997
sponsored by Kentucky
Fried Chicken

01:06.998 --> 01:09.053
called the "Kentucky Fried Chicken

01:09.054 --> 01:11.363
leven herbs & space experience".

01:11.364 --> 01:12.540
Gentlemen...

01:12.851 --> 01:14.908
Greendale's future!

01:14.909 --> 01:15.779
Oh!

01:15.780 --> 01:17.704
Actually, that photo's
from the past.

01:17.705 --> 01:19.674
Here's one more current.

01:20.293 --> 01:21.445
It's seen better days.

01:21.446 --> 01:24.138
I admit... it could
use a good wash.

01:25.483 --> 01:27.766
And I've got just the crew

01:27.780 --> 01:29.373
to wash it.

Can we stop walking in slo-mo now?

01:40.522 --> 01:41.677
20 more yards.

01:42.305 --> 01:44.209
You guys are walking in slo-mo?

02:16.323 --> 02:17.804
I think you know the reason

02:17.805 --> 02:20.199
this group has been
chosen for this job...

02:20.200 --> 02:21.627
to atone.

02:21.628 --> 02:23.750
For the obscene
entry you submitted

02:23.751 --> 02:26.345
in the Greendale
school-flag contest.

02:26.346 --> 02:29.421
That's right... I know
that this isn't a symbol

02:29.422 --> 02:31.439
for the crossroads of ideas.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.332
I now know it's a butt.

02:33.857 --> 02:35.546
Yeah, keep snickering.

02:35.547 --> 02:38.607
Pack yourselves with peanuts
and really be satisfied.

02:38.608 --> 02:39.917
But guess what?

02:40.111 --> 02:41.569
This won.

02:41.753 --> 02:44.340
This is now our
school flag forever.

02:44.561 --> 02:45.677
Proud of yourselves?

02:45.678 --> 02:47.181
How do you know it was our design?

02:47.182 --> 02:48.939
We submitted it anonymously.

02:48.940 --> 02:49.678
Whoops.

02:49.679 --> 02:52.028
One of you actually came forward.

02:53.456 --> 02:54.482
What?

02:54.483 --> 02:56.714
Now, somewhere beneath this dirt

02:56.715 --> 02:58.709
is Greendale's newest pride.

02:58.710 --> 03:00.987
And my hope is that
while you scrub it,

03:00.988 --> 03:03.780
you will find the school
pride in your hearts.

03:03.781 --> 03:05.296
After we clean it,
can we go inside?

03:05.297 --> 03:08.847
No. That is a job for
some upstanding students

03:08.848 --> 03:12.050
who are training right now
in the simulator simulator.

03:12.750 --> 03:15.169
Great job on this.

03:15.240 --> 03:18.416
Hard to believe I'm not
really not really in space.

03:18.417 --> 03:21.342
I expect this craft
to be squeaky clean

03:21.343 --> 03:23.235
in time for the pretend launch

03:23.236 --> 03:25.504
in front of the press at 3:00.

03:25.505 --> 03:26.727
Now, if you'll excuse me,

03:26.728 --> 03:29.360
I have to make this
into a butt flag.

03:30.306 --> 03:32.157
Man, I remember this
thing from High School.

03:32.158 --> 03:33.037
During field trips,

03:33.038 --> 03:34.928
we used to sneak inside and get...

03:35.437 --> 03:36.469
to praying.

03:36.470 --> 03:38.080
Oh, that's nice.

03:38.115 --> 03:39.371
We should take a coffee break.

03:39.372 --> 03:40.795
Let's all get coffee, okay?

03:40.879 --> 03:42.592
Where are Troy and Abed?

03:42.593 --> 03:43.865
I'm pretty sure they made
their way into that thing

03:43.866 --> 03:45.619
five seconds after the Dean left.

03:45.620 --> 03:46.569
What?

03:50.102 --> 03:52.725
It's more beautiful
than I ever imagined.

03:52.726 --> 03:55.208
- You've never been in it?
- My dad never let me.

03:55.465 --> 03:57.239
He always had grudge against
fast-food restaurants.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.961
They almost wiped out
his falafel stand.

03:59.710 --> 04:01.921
But I memorized every
detail of this old girl

04:01.922 --> 04:02.755
on the Internet.

04:02.756 --> 04:04.926
Guys, we can't be in here.

04:04.927 --> 04:06.222
Then get out.

04:06.223 --> 04:07.510
Wow, it's pretty well preserved

04:07.511 --> 04:09.201
for something that
survived the '80s...

04:09.866 --> 04:11.283
And apparently a local transient

04:11.284 --> 04:12.729
who liked to collect doll heads.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.487
The '80s.

04:14.654 --> 04:16.509
Our teen years, right, everybody?

04:16.620 --> 04:18.202
I feel like I'm
underdressed for this.

04:19.247 --> 04:20.601
I'm gonna get something
from the dorm.

04:21.584 --> 04:23.025
Guys, seriously,

04:23.026 --> 04:25.154
I have to ask that we
all step out of here.

04:25.155 --> 04:26.694
Or what, you're gonna tattle on us

04:26.695 --> 04:27.779
like you did with the flag?

04:27.780 --> 04:29.046
I didn't tattle about the flag,

04:29.047 --> 04:30.669
but you shouldn't have
made it in the first place.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.791
If you love Greendale so much,
why don't you marry it?

04:33.871 --> 04:35.073
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

04:35.074 --> 04:36.587
I'm a little claustrophobic,
that's all.

04:36.588 --> 04:39.091
It's no big deal, as long
as I'm standing near a door.

04:39.092 --> 04:41.853
In close situations,
I get a little nuts,

04:41.854 --> 04:43.322
and I don't know,
you know, what's...

04:43.323 --> 04:44.918
- no, no, no!
- Hey, hey!

04:45.264 --> 04:46.257
No!

04:49.441 --> 04:50.222
- Hello?
- Oh!

04:50.223 --> 04:51.475
Greetings.

04:52.096 --> 04:56.955
I am Systematic Android Network
Diode Energy Rocket System.

04:56.956 --> 04:59.635
But you may call me "Sanders".

04:59.861 --> 05:02.690
Sanders. Sanders,
this is Pierce Hawthorne.

05:02.691 --> 05:04.002
Can I get this door open, please?

05:04.003 --> 05:05.492
Hey, look for the handle.

05:05.493 --> 05:07.356
There's got to be a
handle on the door.

05:07.627 --> 05:09.346
You don't know that.
It was the '80s.

05:09.347 --> 05:11.010
Everybody who made
this was on cocaine.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.787
We can't be in here.

05:12.788 --> 05:14.889
Just as Kentucky fried chicken's

05:14.890 --> 05:17.465
secret process seals
in the flavor,

05:17.466 --> 05:19.586
I'm sealing the cabin's air

05:19.587 --> 05:21.898
so you don't explode
on your journey.

05:21.899 --> 05:23.999
- What?
- What does that mean?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.796
Please find a seat,
strap yourself in,

05:26.797 --> 05:28.735
and wait for mission control.

05:28.736 --> 05:30.891
Okay, we got to find a
handle on this door!

05:30.892 --> 05:33.290
Guys, guys, can we just
take a mental step backwards

05:33.291 --> 05:36.141
and realize we are
simply in a winnebago

05:36.142 --> 05:37.342
and we'll be fine.

05:40.158 --> 05:41.040
Oh, God!

05:41.041 --> 05:44.090
Please find a seat,
strap yourself in,

05:44.091 --> 05:45.677
and wait for mission control.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.455
I'm not strapping
myself into a coffin.

05:47.456 --> 05:50.611
We got to get out of here!
I hope you found a seat.

05:50.612 --> 05:54.251
I want you to be safe.
Did you just threaten me?

05:54.252 --> 05:57.052
Pierce, you're talking
to an atari cartridge.

05:57.053 --> 05:58.175
Sit down!

06:02.387 --> 06:04.584
This is part of the
simulation, right?

06:05.186 --> 06:07.343
I don't think this
is a simulation.

06:08.485 --> 06:10.294
I think we're being towed.

06:37.674 --> 06:38.880
- Come on!
- Hello?

06:38.881 --> 06:39.983
Hey, guys, forget it.

06:39.984 --> 06:41.851
Whosever towing us can't hear us.

06:41.852 --> 06:44.003
You know, this is
classic Greendale.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.010
That place deserves an anus flag.

06:46.011 --> 06:47.483
Can anyone get a phone signal?

06:47.484 --> 06:48.751
- No.
- No.

06:48.779 --> 06:50.445
Mine's working,
but it's the black guy

06:50.446 --> 06:51.579
with the wrong number again.

06:51.580 --> 06:54.276
Pierce, I keep telling
you that that is an iPod

06:54.277 --> 06:57.303
and you are listening to
Wesley Snipe's audiobook.

06:57.395 --> 06:59.021
Well, he sure hates
the government.

06:59.451 --> 07:00.842
This is a long shot.

07:01.827 --> 07:05.964
But maybe if I do this,
it will solve everything.

07:10.083 --> 07:11.074
Damn it!

07:12.240 --> 07:13.628
This is all my fault.

07:13.629 --> 07:15.345
- Very much so.
- Oh!

07:15.346 --> 07:17.720
Hey, when you go fishing,
sometimes you catch a boot.

07:18.884 --> 07:20.291
Where...Re...You....

07:20.680 --> 07:22.496
Tel...Where...You are!

07:24.632 --> 07:25.413
Hello?

07:25.414 --> 07:28.900
Where are you hoodlums?
Bring my spaceship back!

07:28.901 --> 07:30.803
Uh, we are...

07:31.362 --> 07:34.314
40 light years outside
of the buttermilk nebula,

07:34.315 --> 07:36.326
although it is possible...

07:38.099 --> 07:39.976
Yeah. It's a sticker.

07:40.215 --> 07:42.334
Hey, terrible Dean.

07:42.335 --> 07:45.513
This thing is being
towed with us in it.

07:45.973 --> 07:48.382
Oh. Oh. Okay, wait.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.777
So handicap spots
count on saturdays?

07:50.778 --> 07:52.723
Assuming we don't wind
up in a compactor,

07:52.724 --> 07:54.888
when we get back,
I'm going to step on you.

07:54.889 --> 07:57.005
Okay, as much as I might
enjoy that, Jeffrey,

07:57.006 --> 07:59.305
if you don't get back here
in time for the launch,

07:59.306 --> 08:00.916
City College wins,

08:00.917 --> 08:03.886
and Greendale becomes just
another school on my resume

08:03.887 --> 08:07.009
that no one can call,
because it doesn't exist.

08:07.010 --> 08:09.273
Now, tell me where you are!

08:09.302 --> 08:12.528
In a moving canister
with no phone and no GPS,

08:12.529 --> 08:15.170
because the only
window is sealed shut.

08:16.651 --> 08:17.857
Hel... hello?

08:18.019 --> 08:19.040
Jeffrey!

08:20.778 --> 08:22.110
It isn't sealed shut.

08:23.009 --> 08:23.882
Hmm?

08:23.905 --> 08:24.976
The window isn't sealed shut.

08:24.977 --> 08:26.891
It slides open when you
complete the simulation.

08:27.617 --> 08:29.330
Well, can you talk
them through it?

08:29.480 --> 08:32.309
Abed, if they can
open that window,

08:32.311 --> 08:35.220
they can tell us where they are,
and we can find them.

08:35.725 --> 08:37.484
I was supposed to
be on that thing.

08:38.625 --> 08:40.082
I know how she works.

08:40.572 --> 08:44.227
Hey. That's why they need
you to bring her home.

08:52.440 --> 08:53.834
I'll get us some coffee.

09:03.264 --> 09:05.092
- Troy.
- Abed?

09:05.093 --> 09:07.115
You can get that window open
by doing the simulation.

09:07.239 --> 09:08.246
Look at the panel on your right

09:08.247 --> 09:10.473
- ...and tell me your recipe.
- Original.

09:10.474 --> 09:11.628
- How many pieces?
- 6

09:11.629 --> 09:12.712
- Flavor heading?
- Tasty.

09:12.713 --> 09:14.158
We need to get it up to delicious.

09:14.496 --> 09:15.771
That makes sense.

09:17.411 --> 09:19.373
Excellent work, Captain.

09:19.374 --> 09:22.153
Now keep your herbs
and spices balanced

09:22.154 --> 09:24.462
while the crew helps
you with teamwork.

09:24.463 --> 09:26.291
Guys, we can get the window open

09:26.292 --> 09:28.572
if you man your terminals,
and we complete the simulation.

09:28.573 --> 09:30.377
Yeah. I got a better idea.

09:30.998 --> 09:32.436
- Oh!
- Jeffrey!

09:35.297 --> 09:36.619
We're all dying.

09:37.096 --> 09:38.634
We're all gonna die!

09:38.635 --> 09:42.465
My readings indicate the
need for cooperation.

09:42.466 --> 09:43.648
I hate to pull rank on you,

09:43.649 --> 09:45.776
but I need you to man
your station now, Jeff.

09:45.777 --> 09:47.636
I hate to pull reality on you,

09:47.637 --> 09:49.711
but you got your rank, Captain,

09:49.712 --> 09:52.616
by sitting in the chair
with the largest knobs!

09:55.008 --> 09:57.593
My readings indicate Pierce...

09:58.069 --> 09:59.178
- What?
- Pierce...

09:59.266 --> 10:00.805
My readings indicate

10:00.832 --> 10:03.469
you're going to die alone.

10:03.537 --> 10:05.205
Why's he saying that?
Why's he...

10:05.272 --> 10:06.940
why's he saying that to me?

10:07.008 --> 10:08.341
Uh, he... he's getting worse.

10:08.409 --> 10:10.676
Almost there.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.145
Stop talking, old man.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.380
You can't make me stop, Pierce,

10:14.447 --> 10:17.650
because Troy is killing
your life force.

10:17.717 --> 10:19.451
- I knew it!
- Oh!

10:19.519 --> 10:20.598
I knew it!

10:26.421 --> 10:27.592
Abed!

10:31.190 --> 10:31.997
Kentucky one...

10:32.677 --> 10:33.539
Do you read me?

10:34.267 --> 10:36.702
Kentucky one, Kentucky one,
do you read me?

10:36.770 --> 10:38.183
Kentucky one, copy.

10:39.152 --> 10:40.506
Kentucky. Come in, Kentucky.

10:40.574 --> 10:42.575
I've worked out a way for
them to reroute the power

10:42.610 --> 10:44.976
from the auxiliary battery.
Reroute to what?

10:48.380 --> 10:49.547
Everybody...

10:49.860 --> 10:51.698
Here is the situation.

10:53.484 --> 10:55.253
This is Greendale.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.727
This is the maximum
distance from Greendale

10:58.771 --> 11:01.332
we can drive to haul
them back up here in time

11:01.376 --> 11:02.739
for the simulated launch.

11:02.942 --> 11:05.970
And these are city impound lots...

11:05.971 --> 11:09.082
Any of which might
be their destination.

11:09.601 --> 11:10.701
What are these other circles?

11:10.903 --> 11:11.721
What other circles?

11:11.748 --> 11:13.648
Looks like you circled
public restrooms

11:13.665 --> 11:15.363
and truck stops. Yeah.

11:15.531 --> 11:17.273
There's another one. - Okay.

11:17.341 --> 11:18.917
That is a different
side of the map,

11:18.979 --> 11:22.511
and that is...
for a different project.

11:22.920 --> 11:23.826
Why do they have star ratings?

11:23.870 --> 11:25.621
- Let's get to work, people!
- Got it.

11:25.648 --> 11:27.099
Talk to me, Buddy. Come on!

11:27.460 --> 11:29.487
Uh, bro, we stopped moving.

11:29.555 --> 11:32.272
Pierce has got space madness,
or he's just old or something.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.820
They're locking him
up in the back.

11:33.874 --> 11:36.292
- Argh!
- Run, Jeff!

11:37.436 --> 11:38.797
You can't do this to me!

11:38.865 --> 11:39.961
We just did!

11:40.130 --> 11:42.178
Guys, please!
You're becoming animals!

11:42.257 --> 11:43.287
Oh, shut up!

11:43.331 --> 11:45.266
We wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for you.

11:45.319 --> 11:46.120
That's not true!

11:46.155 --> 11:48.381
We weren't supposed to be
in here when it happened!

11:51.355 --> 11:52.925
When what happened?

11:54.311 --> 11:55.780
When we got towed?

11:55.816 --> 11:58.279
How did you know we
were gonna get towed?

12:00.186 --> 12:01.869
I set it up.

12:02.749 --> 12:05.512
I called City College
about transferring,

12:05.538 --> 12:08.212
and the Dean told me
that he would get me in

12:08.221 --> 12:10.796
if I helped sabotage
Greendale's launch.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.901
I was supposed to make
sure nobody was around

12:12.919 --> 12:14.010
so that they could steal it.

12:14.036 --> 12:15.902
And then you guys were late,
and then...

12:16.306 --> 12:17.995
Wait, wait. You're transferring?

12:18.013 --> 12:18.470
Why?

12:19.843 --> 12:23.705
You guys thought that
butthole flag was so funny.

12:23.867 --> 12:26.907
I mean, I respect you all enough
to let you hate yourselves,

12:26.935 --> 12:30.230
but I respect myself too much
to let you hate my school.

12:32.050 --> 12:33.641
Eh. I'm not buying it.

12:33.694 --> 12:34.424
Yeah.

12:35.462 --> 12:36.377
Let's kill her.

12:36.404 --> 12:38.939
Wait! City College was behind this?

12:41.656 --> 12:43.193
We have to get back in
time for that launch.

12:43.231 --> 12:44.586
- Why?
- We earned the right

12:44.613 --> 12:47.665
to pick on Greendale
every day by going there.

12:47.732 --> 12:50.634
Our school may be a toilet,
but it's our toilet.

12:50.702 --> 12:53.770
- Nobody craps in it but us.
- Yeah.

12:53.838 --> 12:56.059
- Now, that was inspiring.
- Seriously?

12:59.225 --> 12:59.960
Captain.

13:01.979 --> 13:02.991
Get to your stations.

13:03.035 --> 13:03.897
Okay.

13:05.674 --> 13:07.317
- Thrusters.
- Full.

13:07.584 --> 13:09.300
- Turbo shield.
- On.

13:09.427 --> 13:11.165
- Navigation.
- Three.

13:11.261 --> 13:12.907
- Chicken.
- Yeah.

13:13.566 --> 13:15.739
- Ready?
- Ready.

13:16.258 --> 13:17.727
Suppertime.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.609
Hold it...

13:35.904 --> 13:37.681
Congratulations, crew.

13:37.708 --> 13:39.177
You've worked together.

13:39.203 --> 13:43.285
Now feast your eyes on the
wonders of the cosmos.

13:45.556 --> 13:47.055
Greendale. Greendale.

13:47.083 --> 13:48.702
Everybody be quiet.
Everybody quiet down.

13:48.709 --> 13:49.673
Quiet down.

13:50.468 --> 13:52.313
Say again.
Stand by for location.

14:05.531 --> 14:06.979
What do you see, gang?

14:09.738 --> 14:11.314
We are in...

14:11.877 --> 14:13.046
Coldwater.

14:22.294 --> 14:23.168
Here...

14:23.273 --> 14:25.214
Right next to the truck
stop with three thumbs.

14:28.529 --> 14:29.986
Those aren't thumbs.

14:31.259 --> 14:33.801
Greendale. Do you copy, Greendale?

14:37.562 --> 14:38.642
I'm sorry, Jeff.

14:39.145 --> 14:40.500
I'm afraid...

14:41.362 --> 14:42.603
You're out of town.

14:56.241 --> 14:59.048
I guess somebody'll
come get us eventually.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.872
I really miss Greendale.

15:02.073 --> 15:04.245
How many schools would let
you make a butt flag...

15:04.464 --> 15:06.188
Then actually fly it?

15:06.259 --> 15:08.054
How many schools would
let you get a degree

15:08.098 --> 15:09.983
in theoretical phys ed?

15:10.764 --> 15:11.652
Annie...

15:12.497 --> 15:14.247
We owe you an apology.

15:14.669 --> 15:15.655
Nobody should have to choose

15:15.699 --> 15:17.699
between their friends
and their school.

15:18.852 --> 15:19.942
Thanks.

15:20.291 --> 15:22.454
But you shouldn't have
tattled about the flag.

15:22.624 --> 15:23.571
I tattled.

15:25.350 --> 15:26.960
I told the Dean it was our design.

15:27.328 --> 15:28.928
And I told him it was a butt too.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.189
- What?
- Why, Jeffrey?

15:30.224 --> 15:33.153
He kept not seeing it.
I mean, it was driving me crazy.

15:33.171 --> 15:35.792
It says "e pluribus anus".

15:35.801 --> 15:37.703
I told you we should
have put cheeks on it.

15:37.942 --> 15:40.736
There's a time and
place for subtlety,

15:40.780 --> 15:43.274
and that time was
before Scary movie.

15:43.342 --> 15:44.369
Hey, guys?

15:45.434 --> 15:46.854
I'm feeling a lot better now.

15:48.021 --> 15:50.106
Well, you... you sound good.

15:50.107 --> 15:51.399
Yeah, you know, in a weird way,

15:51.434 --> 15:52.841
being in a smaller
place like this,

15:52.885 --> 15:54.759
I was able to work
through some things.

15:55.786 --> 15:57.748
I think I'm ready to come out.

16:10.825 --> 16:11.920
I'll kill you!

16:12.110 --> 16:14.423
I will kill you, Sanders!

16:14.511 --> 16:16.667
- Congratulations...
- Come on, man, come on.

16:16.799 --> 16:18.172
Let go!

16:20.740 --> 16:21.680
No!

16:21.840 --> 16:24.100
Get off my mommy! I'm her man!

16:24.294 --> 16:26.916
Pierce, stop! Stop it! Calm down!

16:31.420 --> 16:32.983
Who's feeling skinny?

16:36.910 --> 16:38.458
Dean? The press is here.

16:38.503 --> 16:40.026
- Oh...
- I tried to buy us some time

16:40.094 --> 16:41.617
with these double-icious
sandwiches,

16:41.687 --> 16:44.582
but they thought I was doing
product integration for KFC.

16:45.981 --> 16:48.624
This hawaiian bread
is so good, though.

16:50.636 --> 16:52.270
Time to face the music.

16:52.745 --> 16:53.907
Craig.

16:54.602 --> 16:55.380
Stephen.

16:56.203 --> 16:57.549
I'm surprised to see you here.

16:57.901 --> 17:00.469
You don't think I'd miss your
moment of triumph, do you?

17:00.566 --> 17:04.403
Greendale beating City College
into simulated space?

17:04.946 --> 17:06.204
Unless...

17:06.816 --> 17:09.496
You're having trouble
locating your ship.

17:10.692 --> 17:11.782
You.

17:12.592 --> 17:14.202
You were behind this?

17:15.575 --> 17:18.365
The next time you
provoke City College,

17:18.734 --> 17:21.271
you will lose more
than a winnebago.

17:24.224 --> 17:26.898
Greendale. Come in, greendale.

17:27.321 --> 17:28.703
Go ahead, Kentucky.

17:28.764 --> 17:30.473
You can call off the rescue.

17:30.541 --> 17:32.214
We're coming to save you.

17:44.619 --> 17:47.619
Come on, you family-sized
bucket of bolts.

17:56.056 --> 17:58.302
Abed, construction on spring road.

17:58.994 --> 18:00.487
I see it. Left on apple valley.

18:00.806 --> 18:02.768
Annie, left on apple.

18:02.803 --> 18:03.907
Hold tight!

18:09.191 --> 18:11.164
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:11.316 --> 18:13.824
- Hi.
- Get off of me.

18:16.449 --> 18:18.120
They'll never make it back, Craig.

18:18.490 --> 18:21.323
That thing might as well be
on a simulation of the moon.

18:21.358 --> 18:22.863
Oh, you know wha... 

18:25.762 --> 18:27.337
Ah, yes!

18:32.352 --> 18:33.455
Hey, look out!

18:41.345 --> 18:42.850
- Whoo!
- What just happened?

19:03.102 --> 19:04.105
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:04.149 --> 19:06.506
returning from their
maiden simulation,

19:06.568 --> 19:10.265
the fabulous Greendale
greenstronauts!

19:35.005 --> 19:36.712
Well, Annie...

19:36.924 --> 19:40.921
I suppose you're not City
College material after all.

19:41.745 --> 19:43.215
Thank you.

19:44.165 --> 19:45.232
- Annie!
- Good job.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.875
That's good!

19:48.929 --> 19:51.181
Just to say... could
you hold on one second?

19:55.443 --> 19:56.812
Great job up there, Captain.

19:56.943 --> 19:58.012
Really?

19:58.337 --> 20:00.148
You think I could be a
real astronaut someday?

20:00.279 --> 20:01.777
Well, if NASA ever needs someone

20:01.830 --> 20:04.584
to keep an arrow inside
of a moving rectangle,

20:04.716 --> 20:06.221
I know who I'd recommend.

20:09.546 --> 20:10.602
Abed...

20:10.987 --> 20:12.881
Want to ta a seat in
the Captain's chair?

20:13.156 --> 20:14.162
I think you've earned it.

20:14.403 --> 20:16.039
No, thanks.
I can't imagine anything

20:16.074 --> 20:17.958
that could have been cooler
than what I've done today.

20:20.439 --> 20:21.660
Okay, that was cooler.

20:36.147 --> 20:37.482
In the future...

20:38.800 --> 20:41.123
Mission control, headed for base.

20:42.699 --> 20:43.909
Target acquired.

20:46.359 --> 20:47.961
Mission control,
I've got a bogie on my 6.

20:47.962 --> 20:49.461
Yeah, I'm on your 6.

20:49.462 --> 20:50.579
Evasive maneuvers.

20:53.258 --> 20:54.538
Still on your 6.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.417
I took evasive maneuvers.
You can't be on my 6.

20:56.452 --> 20:57.544
Then I'm on your 12.

20:57.628 --> 20:59.093
That means I'm your 6.

21:00.620 --> 21:01.294
Good.
