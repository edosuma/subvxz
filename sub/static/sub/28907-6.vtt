I've seen lots of weird

blowing my mind.

I'm really, really
freaking pressed for time.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.220

00:22.220 --> 00:23.920
-Stop.
-Got something going on.

that all our parts?

Damn, that's some
power coats.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.690
What'd ya say?
I call it power coat.

01:00.690 --> 01:04.120
You see how color can be
laid down slick and shiny?

01:04.130 --> 01:06.490
No, the paint looks
better than this.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.600
Look at that, you call
that slick and shiny?

01:08.600 --> 01:10.400
Brian: The '33 shop truck
is moving right along.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.330
We just got our suspension
parts back from powder coat,

01:12.330 --> 01:14.270
and mike painted the
frame a matching green.

01:14.270 --> 01:15.600
For the rest of the truck,
richard wants to keep

01:15.600 --> 01:17.570
the old patina, and I think
that's the right call.

01:17.570 --> 01:19.310
When I bought the truck,
I envisioned it

01:19.310 --> 01:22.340
as being sort of this crusty,
beat-up hot rod truck,

01:22.340 --> 01:24.080
which would have
a fresh, new frame.

01:24.080 --> 01:26.310
A nice looking engine,
a rebuilt suspension,

01:26.320 --> 01:27.780
and really that's what
we're doing to it.

01:27.780 --> 01:29.220
It was a back-burner job for me,

01:29.220 --> 01:31.520
until richard came by my shop.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.750
This is a '33 ford
pickup, and actually--

01:33.760 --> 01:35.220
that's where richard
fell pretty hard

01:35.220 --> 01:36.690
for this '33 ford model b.

01:36.690 --> 01:38.360
No kiddin'.
I bought it for myself,

01:38.360 --> 01:39.560
just to build
as a shop truck.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.900
This thing's pretty sweet,
and you know I like green.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.660
Uh, oh, well, it's
not gonna be cheap.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.030
Here's the tricky trick,
I've got an h&h flathead,

01:46.040 --> 01:47.370
all built, in the box.

01:47.370 --> 01:48.700
Well, that'd bolt right
in there, just about.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.270
Mm-hmm.
You're money's green here.

01:50.270 --> 01:51.840
Hell, yeah.

01:51.840 --> 01:55.680
$15,000 later,
richard owns my truck,

01:55.680 --> 01:57.740
and I get to build
it on his dime.

01:57.750 --> 02:01.150
For me, that's like having
my cake and eating it too.

02:01.150 --> 02:02.750
Plus, I'm remembering
why I fell in love

02:02.750 --> 02:04.120
with this truck,
in the first place.

02:04.120 --> 02:07.350
So, I hope richard doesn't
turn around and sell it.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.720
Richard:
This is a great deal for me.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.660
Brian did the hard part
by finding the '33,

02:10.660 --> 02:12.530
and pulling it out
of somebody's barn.

02:12.530 --> 02:15.200
Plus, he's already got a
solid plan for it in his head.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.470
That's why he's here, to
bring his vision to the build.

02:18.470 --> 02:20.730
The fords that came out
in the early 1930s are what

02:20.740 --> 02:23.670
kicked off american hot-rodding
right after world war ii.

02:23.670 --> 02:25.840
These had the first v8s
that just about anybody

02:25.840 --> 02:27.980
could afford and
modify as they saw fit.

02:27.980 --> 02:29.980
The trucks had the advantage
that they could haul ass,

02:29.980 --> 02:32.480
as well as haul
just about anything else.

02:32.480 --> 02:33.750
What do you think
of my glass?

02:33.750 --> 02:35.020
I think you went a
little overboard.

02:35.020 --> 02:36.120
[ laughs ]
we're not using it.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.250
He figured
you could sell it.

02:37.250 --> 02:38.950
I been thinking
about keeping the '33

02:38.950 --> 02:40.920
as a shop truck, but,
seeing the build come along,

02:40.920 --> 02:42.520
I'm thinking it might
be worth a lot of money,

02:42.530 --> 02:44.320
so, everything's for sale.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.560
Brian wants to hold on to it,

02:45.560 --> 02:47.760
because he's an artist,
but, y'all know me.

02:47.760 --> 02:48.860
It's all about the benjamins.

02:48.860 --> 02:49.900
What's the deal with the bed?

02:49.900 --> 02:51.270
'cause I saw it has a rip in it.

02:51.270 --> 02:53.830
Yeah, the bed floor
is kinda trashed.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.800
Brian: Originally my idea
was to coat the bed

02:55.800 --> 02:57.340
with some kind of liner, just to

02:57.340 --> 02:59.010
protect cargo from
the rust and crap.

02:59.010 --> 03:00.470
But, I think it's
gonna be too cool

03:00.480 --> 03:02.440
to be just a parts
hauler, or something

03:02.440 --> 03:04.210
you throw dirty old
parts in the back,

03:04.210 --> 03:06.950
but, that's a catch-22
because if it is

03:06.950 --> 03:08.450
the hot rod shop truck,
we all get to maybe

03:08.450 --> 03:09.450
drive it every once in a while.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.220
But, if it's too
cool for that then

03:11.220 --> 03:12.920
it's gonna get
sold down the road

03:12.920 --> 03:14.090
and we'll never see
it again, probably.

03:14.090 --> 03:15.460
So yeah, that's a tough one.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.490
What's that hole for?

03:17.490 --> 03:19.960
You put a penny down there and
it starts the truck up.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.430
Brian: Richard set a
deadline of two weeks,

03:21.430 --> 03:22.800
and gave us $10,000.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.300
With the flathead
richard already bought,

03:24.300 --> 03:25.700
and supposedly ready to bolt in,

03:25.700 --> 03:28.040
that wouldn't be a big issue.

03:28.040 --> 03:31.040
But, as soon as we uncrated it,
I realized we had a problem.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.240
Uh, wait, this
isn't gonna bolt in to

03:33.240 --> 03:34.680
our truck the way it is.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.240
No, that is not gonna fit
without

03:36.250 --> 03:38.580
changing some stuff.
That sucks.

03:38.580 --> 03:40.380
All we're trying to do is
get it on the engine stand.

03:40.380 --> 03:42.250
That will work in
our truck, but,

03:42.250 --> 03:43.350
to make it work in
our truck we have to

03:43.350 --> 03:44.790
change everything on
the front of the engine.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.450
Water pumps, timing
cover, distributor.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.690
All that stuff's in the way.

03:48.690 --> 03:51.230
There's not enough room
to clear the radiator.

03:51.230 --> 03:52.660
We're gonna change all
that to make it fit,

03:52.660 --> 03:54.160
and that's gonna
add a lot of time, but,

03:54.160 --> 03:56.430
this is the engine we
gotta use, we gotta do it.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.800
Swapping out those parts
includes changing the cam,

04:02.810 --> 04:04.570
timing gear, and
the crank pulley.

04:04.570 --> 04:06.410
This is a seven ton
job right here, man.

04:06.410 --> 04:09.580
It takes a bunch of time,
and a little brute force.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.480
So, this is the one
we took off,

04:15.480 --> 04:17.350
this is the new one,
dye has to go outside.

04:17.350 --> 04:19.050
I like the flathead ford motors,

04:19.050 --> 04:20.690
I have one in my own
car, now I don't know

04:20.690 --> 04:22.360
if I would have chosen
this exact engine.

04:22.360 --> 04:25.430
But, that said, we're building a
very traditional hot rod pickup,

04:25.430 --> 04:26.960
and I'm just stoked about that.

04:28.460 --> 04:29.730
Boom, right there.

04:29.730 --> 04:31.060
I'm letting jason
apply the muscle,

04:31.070 --> 04:33.770
making this fix.

04:33.770 --> 04:35.270
Ugh, I knew that
was gonna happen.

04:35.270 --> 04:37.900
Ooh, I see a little mark,
ooh, you're gonna bleed.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.100
and he's just not
going to get to it.

05:07.100 --> 05:12.640
So I thought, shorty, full
size, ford van, '72.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.170
Please tell me
it's yellow.

05:14.180 --> 05:15.280
Oh, yeah, it's
all yellowed and --

05:15.280 --> 05:17.380
is it really?
Dave is like,

05:17.380 --> 05:19.750
the van dude,
he's the van connoisseur.

05:19.750 --> 05:22.050
He's the guy that
lived in the '70s,

05:22.050 --> 05:23.650
always had vans his whole life,

05:23.650 --> 05:25.120
even when vans weren't cool.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.590
'70s vans are hot right now,

05:26.590 --> 05:27.890
and a lot of people
are building 'em.

05:27.890 --> 05:29.860
Which means I gotta pounce
on all the vans I can

05:29.860 --> 05:31.960

time to make fat stacks.

of the fire hydrant either,

05:43.770 --> 05:44.940

for that as well.

05:52.850 --> 05:54.110

about two years ago,

06:21.740 --> 06:24.240

it's getting harder

07:02.850 --> 07:04.320

make any sense,

even spelled like that.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.290
[ laughs ]

07:42.290 --> 07:43.960
man, this thing's solid.

07:43.960 --> 07:47.030
I love it, I love the fact
that it's all original.

07:47.030 --> 07:48.760
-Hey, richard?
-Sir.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.530
Big chris: Just remember
we're back here, okay?

07:50.530 --> 07:52.130
Don't do anything...

07:52.130 --> 07:53.470
How's it do off-road?

07:53.470 --> 07:54.630
We can find out.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.700
Dennis:
Oh, you've gotta be kidding.

07:55.700 --> 07:58.840
Hold on!
This is a bad idea.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.410
[ laughter ]

08:01.410 --> 08:04.380
I told you this was
gonna be a bad idea.

08:04.380 --> 08:07.650
Big chris: Oh, my god.
The sand's comin' in here, dude!

08:07.650 --> 08:08.920
Richard: Cruised around
the neighborhood,

08:08.920 --> 08:09.950
which is very nice,
but then I've got

08:09.950 --> 08:12.150
a big giant sand lot to play in.

08:12.150 --> 08:13.320
Whoo!

08:13.320 --> 08:14.990
It's dusty now. [ coughing ]

08:14.990 --> 08:17.090
you know me and donuts, so.

08:17.090 --> 08:18.190
Where's your house?

08:18.190 --> 08:19.860
It's like call of the wild.

08:19.860 --> 08:22.700
Freakin' rad!

08:22.700 --> 08:24.430
Alright, well we passed
the donut test,

08:24.430 --> 08:27.400
and the driving test,
now we gotta talk money.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.670
Yes, sir.

08:28.670 --> 08:31.000
After taking this thing
for a drive, it is solid.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.140
And the market right now is
so hot for these things,

08:33.140 --> 08:34.470
if they're in good shape.

08:34.480 --> 08:35.910
I could probably even
just flip the thing

08:35.910 --> 08:38.650
and make a bundle, if I can
get it for the right price.

08:38.650 --> 08:42.020
Alright, so, what's
it gonna take, dave?

08:42.020 --> 08:43.580
Well, seeing ya
got her all dirty,

08:43.590 --> 08:45.050
probably can't
sell it now.

08:45.050 --> 08:46.420
[ laughter ]

08:46.420 --> 08:48.050
I'd like to get
10 grand out of it.

08:48.060 --> 08:51.460
[ scoffs ] it's a van
from the '70s.

08:51.460 --> 08:53.460
Exactly,
that's what I'm saying.

08:53.460 --> 08:56.130
He immediately says
he's gonna want 10,

08:56.130 --> 08:57.500
and I almost told him okay.

08:57.500 --> 09:01.300
You used to could buy this thing
for $1,000 bucks, ya know?

09:01.300 --> 09:03.840
Yeah.
So, how 'bout 5 grand?

09:03.840 --> 09:07.040
$5,000 ain't gonna
work, '70s vans are hot.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.280
Alright, how 'bout $6,500?

09:09.280 --> 09:11.080
I'll go $6,500.
[ sighs ]

09:11.080 --> 09:13.180
nope, nope.

09:13.180 --> 09:14.780
I'll work with you
a little bit, but --

09:14.780 --> 09:16.020
well, show me a little bit.
That's not a little bit.

09:16.020 --> 09:20.120
What's a little bit?
I'd say probably 9 grand.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.120
That's definitely way more
than I wanted to spend,

09:22.120 --> 09:23.720
but, whether I build it
or flip it,

09:23.730 --> 09:25.260
I think I'm still
gonna make money.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.060
Plus, I don't think
I'll find another one

09:27.060 --> 09:28.400
in better condition out there.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.900
I'm gonna pull the trigger.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.230
Alright, I really thought
I was coming out here

09:32.230 --> 09:33.730
to buy this thing
for about 5 grand,

09:33.740 --> 09:35.200
but how about $8,000?

09:36.510 --> 09:39.110
$8,000
and it's gotta be cash.

09:39.110 --> 09:40.340
[ laughs ]
cash?

09:40.340 --> 09:41.910
Is there any other
form of payment?

09:41.910 --> 09:43.240
Not in this house.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.810
Not in this house
either, brother.

09:44.810 --> 09:46.580
Alright.
That is super rad.

09:46.580 --> 09:48.380
While we had fun,
I got my van bought.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.520
I know you guys don't like it,

09:49.520 --> 09:51.620
you're out, you're
dirty, you're all dusty.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.890
Somebody over there on
that side of the camera

09:53.890 --> 09:55.920
decided that it'd be cool
if we were sitting

09:55.920 --> 09:57.890
on a rock waterfall,
now that we've got

09:57.890 --> 09:59.260
the scenic view out of the way,

09:59.260 --> 10:00.960
let's go find out if
this guy's got beer.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.000
Whoo!

10:02.000 --> 10:03.060
Let's go seal the deal,

10:03.070 --> 10:04.660
get ya paid,
do some paperwork.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.000
Ya got any beer here?
I do.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.370
Here's my beer assistant.

10:10.570 --> 10:12.770
Nice.

10:12.770 --> 10:15.010
Richard: Hey, van dave,
you mind if we take

10:15.010 --> 10:18.180
a quick dip in the pool
and wash this dust off?

10:18.180 --> 10:20.080
Narrator: Coming up
on "fast n' loud"...

10:20.080 --> 10:21.410
This one's kinda
blowing my mind.

10:21.420 --> 10:23.780
...The '33 ford starts buggin'.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.650
It's a ginormous wasp nest.
Yah!

10:25.650 --> 10:28.150
Narrator: And richard banks
on the big payday.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.490
So, what is the real hurry?

10:29.490 --> 10:30.790
You know me, man,
once it starts looking

10:30.790 --> 10:32.290
good like this, I
start thinking dollars.

10:32.290 --> 10:34.160
Maybe we sell it,
so, giddy up.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.160
What'd I tell ya.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.570
â™ª

10:44.570 --> 10:46.170
[ groan ]

10:46.170 --> 10:48.980
[ laughter ]
what are ya doin'?

10:48.980 --> 10:50.740
Isn't that how you hug?
No.

10:50.750 --> 10:51.910
I thought that was
how you wanted to hug?

10:51.910 --> 10:53.350
No, that was like
trying to tackle me.

10:53.350 --> 10:54.410
You guys do things
different around here.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.350
Yeah, I guess
apparently we do,

10:56.350 --> 10:58.220
that was kinda
violent, I like it.

10:58.220 --> 10:59.750
Brian: Today we're trying to
get back on schedule

10:59.760 --> 11:01.890
with the '33 shop truck build.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.290
Richard may have
saved money using

11:04.290 --> 11:05.730
the flathead he already
had, but we spent

11:05.730 --> 11:07.690
extra time making
changes so it would fit.

11:07.700 --> 11:08.960
[ hammering ]

11:08.960 --> 11:11.060
one, two, three, go.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.070
The suspension parts are
all back from powder coating,

11:13.070 --> 11:14.430
and if all goes together
smoothly,

11:14.440 --> 11:16.140
we'll be back on track
and have a rolling chassis

11:16.140 --> 11:17.200
by the end of the day.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.710
What are you doing
way up there?

11:18.710 --> 11:20.870
I'm going with a different rear
end, I'd say, for this truck.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.480
It's another part I tossed in
to the deal with richard.

11:25.050 --> 11:27.150
It has a higher gear
ratio that's a better match

11:27.150 --> 11:28.850
to the power our flathead
should be putting out.

11:28.850 --> 11:30.050
[ grunting ]

11:30.050 --> 11:31.450
keep that, there we go.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.920
I think you got this
with, like, one hand.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.090
There we go.

11:36.090 --> 11:37.560
Back in its day, the
model b's top speed

11:37.560 --> 11:39.130
was maybe 50 miles an hour,

11:39.130 --> 11:40.490
but with the added power
of the flathead,

11:40.500 --> 11:42.030
and a higher gear ratio,
this old truck

11:42.030 --> 11:44.430
will easily do 75.

11:44.430 --> 11:46.370
We're triple teaming this
thing to get it done fast,

11:46.370 --> 11:48.270
while charles is
assembling the front end,

11:48.270 --> 11:49.640
jeremy and I are
putting together

11:49.640 --> 11:51.270
the hubs and the
brakes in the rear.

11:52.940 --> 11:55.710
Well, that's not right,
what's going on here?

11:58.680 --> 12:00.250
The hub on one side
was rubbing bad,

12:00.250 --> 12:02.580
but okay on the other,
so, I measured both sides

12:02.580 --> 12:04.720
and somehow one axle was
shorter than the other.

12:04.720 --> 12:05.920
How's that possible?

12:05.920 --> 12:07.450
I don't see how it
could be any shorter.

12:07.460 --> 12:08.820
Doesn't make any sense.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.490
I'll double check
and measure it again.

12:10.490 --> 12:13.290
Right at five inches,

12:13.300 --> 12:15.360
and over here
we're at 4 and --

12:15.360 --> 12:17.230
so, we're seven-eighths
difference.

12:17.230 --> 12:18.470
How is that even possible?

12:18.470 --> 12:20.070
We can put the engine
and transmission in it,

12:20.070 --> 12:21.230
but if we have to take
the rear end back apart,

12:21.240 --> 12:22.400
then that's really
gonna slow it down.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.740
A pain in the -- yeah.

12:23.740 --> 12:25.510
I've seen lots of weird
stuff on these cars,

12:25.510 --> 12:27.110
and this one's kinda
blowing my mind.

12:27.110 --> 12:29.640
It's never easy,
it's gas monkey.

12:29.640 --> 12:30.810
We could probably
run it this way,

12:30.810 --> 12:32.080
it probably went down
the road just fine,

12:32.080 --> 12:34.950
but, the right thing
to do is fix it now.

12:34.950 --> 12:36.550
All we can figure, is
somewhere in this truck's life,

12:36.550 --> 12:38.380
something in the rear end broke,
and an axle got replaced

12:38.390 --> 12:40.490
with one from a later year.
And that was a different size.

12:40.490 --> 12:42.820
This thing has apparently been
bastardized through the years.

12:42.820 --> 12:44.560
You have to think
too, even though this truck

12:44.560 --> 12:47.390
has been sitting
for probably 30 or 40 years,

12:47.400 --> 12:49.360
they used it for 30 or
40 years before that,

12:49.360 --> 12:51.030
so who knows what
happened in that time.

12:51.030 --> 12:52.430
Call me a hoarder,
but there's a reason

12:52.430 --> 12:53.830
why I never throw anything away.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.540
Our solution, well,
it's out in the back.

12:55.540 --> 12:57.100
That's the original
'33 rear end.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.710
I'll let tony handle
the dismantling...

13:00.710 --> 13:02.140
Alright.

13:02.140 --> 13:03.540
...Because I'm just
after the axles.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.010
Alright, that's all we need.

13:05.010 --> 13:07.410
Merry christmas.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.650
What's up, guys?

13:09.650 --> 13:12.520
We're taking a couple
steps backwards right now.

13:12.520 --> 13:13.890
Why are we taking
a step backwards?

13:13.890 --> 13:15.520
It's got two
mix-matched axles in it,

13:15.520 --> 13:17.760
and none of us caught it
when we had it apart,

13:17.760 --> 13:19.290
so, we're working
to find that now.

13:19.290 --> 13:20.560
We're talking a half
inch difference.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.090
So, if we don't take
care of it now,

13:22.100 --> 13:23.330
it's gonna cost us
more time later.

13:23.330 --> 13:25.130
I get it, I'm just
really, really

13:25.130 --> 13:27.570
freakin' pressed for time.
So, what is the real hurry?

13:27.570 --> 13:29.000
You know me, man, once
it starts looking good

13:29.000 --> 13:30.740
like this, I start
thinking dollars.

13:30.740 --> 13:32.270
Richard: I know brian loves
his hand-crafted,

13:32.270 --> 13:34.340
original, artisanal
parts but, you know me.

13:34.340 --> 13:36.610
I'm just about the cash,
and anything that'll

13:36.610 --> 13:37.980
keep gas monkey blowin' up.

13:37.980 --> 13:39.650
Which means we can't
be wasting time.

13:39.650 --> 13:41.110
Maybe the flathead
surprise was mine,

13:41.120 --> 13:42.580
but this rear end,
is all on brian,

13:42.580 --> 13:44.420
and that makes us even,
so, giddy up.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.950
All we gotta do is
get the old one out --

13:47.960 --> 13:49.260
see, ya can't tell
that half inch

13:49.260 --> 13:50.260
difference like this.
No, you can't.

13:50.260 --> 13:51.320
Yeah.
Okay.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.690
Put new axles in it,
stick it back together,

13:52.690 --> 13:54.590
jam it back in
and we'll be done.

13:54.600 --> 14:01.500
â™ª

14:01.500 --> 14:05.000
it has been over a month since

14:05.010 --> 14:07.810
richard has taken a look
at any of this stuff.

14:07.810 --> 14:13.410
â™ª

14:13.420 --> 14:14.750
maybe we can corner
him, it looks

14:14.750 --> 14:16.220
like he just pulled up.
Yeah.

14:16.220 --> 14:17.980
Come on, boo, little peepee.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.890
Oh, wait, he's coming in.

14:20.890 --> 14:23.190
We have a bit of a
project for you, sir.

14:23.190 --> 14:24.890
You've sloughed this off
for about a month.

14:24.890 --> 14:27.060
Why am I reading all this
right now, it's morning.

14:27.060 --> 14:29.330
Everything is open,
and ready to go.

14:29.330 --> 14:31.200
Can't I get a cup of
coffee or something?

14:31.200 --> 14:32.400
That's what you
tell us every day,

14:32.400 --> 14:33.670
and nothing ever happens.

14:33.670 --> 14:34.830
You're gonna have to figure out

14:34.840 --> 14:36.270
what to do with all this mail.

14:36.270 --> 14:37.800
Richard: We got a lot going
on at gas monkey,

14:37.810 --> 14:39.340
so when I'm not out
growing the brand,

14:39.340 --> 14:41.070
or building cars,
or buying vans,

14:41.080 --> 14:42.740
I gotta stay on
top of my fan mail.

14:42.740 --> 14:45.480
The more you get, the bigger
you're gettin' right?

14:45.480 --> 14:47.380
That's pretty rad.

14:47.380 --> 14:50.920
There's 10 bucks in here.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.390
High five on that.
Yeah.

14:53.390 --> 14:56.990
We got the land of lincoln,
what's the land of lincoln?

14:56.990 --> 14:59.790
Nebraska. No?
No, it's not.

14:59.790 --> 15:02.500
What is that?

15:02.500 --> 15:05.230
Hey, squirrel.
Let's look at the cool stuff.

15:05.230 --> 15:06.570
Give me the little richard.

15:06.570 --> 15:07.730
I've been trying to give
you the richard for years.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.100
Oh, god,
give me the damn thing.

15:09.100 --> 15:10.700
Shut the hell up,
and just read 'em.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.010
Alright, alright, alright.

15:12.010 --> 15:13.570
This is from just
a couple weeks ago.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.640
[ cellphone rings ]

15:14.640 --> 15:15.940
hold on,
that could be my phone.

15:15.940 --> 15:17.840
Yeah, I've got stuff
to do guys.

15:22.550 --> 15:23.920
Hurry up.

15:26.860 --> 15:29.460
You're not done yet.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.930
[ laughter ]

15:35.560 --> 15:37.100
alright, alright,
give me a solid?

15:37.100 --> 15:39.370
Tap out!
Alright, tap out.

15:39.370 --> 15:40.570
Alright,
that's what I thought.

15:40.570 --> 15:41.800
You some kind
of judo boy, what?

15:41.800 --> 15:43.770
Do you know judo?
Jiu jitsu.

15:43.770 --> 15:45.410
I did jiu jitsu
for a few years.

15:45.410 --> 15:46.840
Yeah, apparently
I didn't.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.840
I need to work on that.

15:48.840 --> 15:53.850
â™ª

15:53.850 --> 15:56.380
I have an idea, but I guess
I need to run it by everybody,

15:56.380 --> 15:59.020
because it seems like
it'd be a good idea,

15:59.020 --> 16:00.320
if everybody was
on the same page.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.020
If you're really gonna
use this as a shop truck,

16:02.020 --> 16:04.090
I think having all
this dirt here, to transfer

16:04.090 --> 16:05.930
on to whatever you put in here,
is a bad idea.

16:05.930 --> 16:07.930
So, I think we need
to put something down,

16:07.930 --> 16:10.260
just so it's a clean
surface for hauling parts.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.230
We've built
shop trucks before,

16:12.230 --> 16:13.400
and the only thing
that happened,

16:13.400 --> 16:14.770
they never got used
as a shop truck,

16:14.770 --> 16:16.140
they got sold.
Okay.

16:16.140 --> 16:18.070
That's exact same thing
that's gonna happen with this.

16:18.070 --> 16:19.640
I know richard's always
looking to make a sale,

16:19.640 --> 16:21.070
but I'd much rather
the truck remain here

16:21.080 --> 16:23.710
at gas monkey, as a cool
piece of utilitarian art.

16:23.710 --> 16:26.110
It's not his build,
it's our build, so,

16:26.110 --> 16:28.480
it's a democracy, I say
we leave it like this.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.350
I like it like this, if we
clean it up or whatever,

16:30.350 --> 16:32.050
and just get the rust
off of it that's cool.

16:32.050 --> 16:33.950
Everything on this
truck is area specific.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.720
Okay, what's your opinion?

16:36.730 --> 16:38.020
Leave it the way it is.

16:38.030 --> 16:39.830
What's your opinion?
-My opinion,

16:39.830 --> 16:41.930
jeremy: I like the bed liner
for the shop truck thing,

16:41.930 --> 16:44.860
but I do agree that
it is way modern,

16:44.870 --> 16:46.200
for what we are building.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.600
I want it to look
right, and you guys

16:47.600 --> 16:49.070
are all telling me that
bed liner won't look right.

16:49.070 --> 16:51.100
I'm on board with that,
but the other concern

16:51.110 --> 16:52.570
is I want it
to be functional.

16:52.570 --> 16:55.310
If they want a new car they'll
just go and buy a 2018 car.

16:55.310 --> 16:56.880
So, are we gonna agree
to satin clear it,

16:56.880 --> 16:58.310
after we get done
with the repairs?

16:58.310 --> 16:59.950
Yeah, we can totally
satin clear it,

16:59.950 --> 17:02.020
that's easy.
Alright, there.

17:02.020 --> 17:03.950
Brian: I said my piece and
the monkeys have spoken.

17:03.950 --> 17:05.690
Repair and clear
the bed it shall be.

17:05.690 --> 17:07.250
So, that means
jeremy can move on to

17:07.260 --> 17:08.690
welding up the tear in the bed.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.290
Jeremy: I'm gonna do a really
crappy repair here,

17:13.290 --> 17:14.790
'cause I want it to
look like it's one

17:14.800 --> 17:17.330
of the old repairs that
was done a long time ago.

17:17.330 --> 17:19.430
The whole rest of the
truck is a rat rod patina

17:19.430 --> 17:21.970
kinda thing, so I could
spend all day trying

17:21.970 --> 17:24.000
to repair this, or, I
could just make it look

17:24.010 --> 17:28.880
like the rest of the truck,
which is more fitting.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.440
I actually want
this to look like

17:30.450 --> 17:31.710
old boy was working on the farm,

17:31.710 --> 17:33.280
he accidentally
messed up his bed,

17:33.280 --> 17:34.580
he just went in, took
the stoke welder,

17:34.580 --> 17:36.950
and fixed up his bed and
carried on with his work.

17:36.950 --> 17:38.820
Brian: The '33 build
is a different kind

17:38.820 --> 17:40.450
of an animal than the
monkeys are used to.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.690
We'll make the
running gear and motor

17:41.690 --> 17:43.360
like brand new,
while keeping

17:43.360 --> 17:45.060
the crusty shop truck
look on the outside.

17:45.060 --> 17:47.430
You'd think that'd be easy.

17:47.430 --> 17:48.800
Got you something.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.660
But the truck still has
to serve its purpose,

17:50.670 --> 17:53.130
hauling stuff from the
parts store, or whatever.

17:53.130 --> 17:55.540
Jeremy: This is the kind of
repairs I do, man.

17:55.540 --> 17:56.970
It's heavier than it looks.

17:56.970 --> 17:58.670
It's that water-logged wood,
man.

17:58.670 --> 18:01.110
That's what it is.
That old wood is heavy.

18:01.110 --> 18:03.610
My new plan is to seal
the rusty stuff with clear coat,

18:03.610 --> 18:05.210
but first, it
needs to be cleaned up.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.780
Oh, my god. [ laughs ]

18:07.780 --> 18:09.380
it's a ginormous
wasp nest.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.420
That's a housing complex
for dirt-dobbers.

18:11.420 --> 18:13.890
It's like a time share.
Ew!

18:15.120 --> 18:18.830
I guess they start as little
bugs and end up as wasps?

18:18.830 --> 18:20.430
I don't know.

18:20.430 --> 18:22.230
Just glad there's no wasps left.

18:22.230 --> 18:23.760
Here! Ah!

18:23.770 --> 18:25.930
[ laughs ]

18:25.930 --> 18:29.340
brian: Tony gets the pleasure
of sanding down the bed.

18:29.340 --> 18:33.140
Get it done, and
if time is money,

18:33.140 --> 18:34.740
I'm an hour past paid, buddy.

18:36.310 --> 18:38.380
Brian: And I apply a loving
coat of clear.

18:38.380 --> 18:39.950
It'll darken the metal
some, but still keep

18:39.950 --> 18:43.320
the 85-year-old look,
without being so damn crusty.

18:46.490 --> 18:48.050
One little adjustment,
we'll need to notch it

18:48.060 --> 18:49.890
to accommodate new shock mounts.

18:49.890 --> 18:51.590
Need some clearance clearance.

18:53.290 --> 18:54.790
Let's burn some wood.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.940
-that smells terrible.
-[ laughing ] whoo!

19:09.780 --> 19:11.580
I feel like I'm watching
you do a burn out.

19:11.580 --> 19:13.580
Oh, yeah, I feel like it.

Are we betting money on it?
It is vegas.

19:23.260 --> 19:24.560

something wrong.

didn't know

hug or something.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.380
-Nope.
-Brian?

19:46.380 --> 19:48.450
You wanna hug?
Somebody handing out hugs?

19:48.450 --> 19:49.850
Brian: Nope.
Are you afraid?

19:49.850 --> 19:50.980
I'll take a hug.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.080
I got personal boundaries.

19:52.090 --> 19:53.250
I think brian needs a hug.

19:53.250 --> 19:54.820
And I think I see
a distributor

19:54.820 --> 19:57.620
that just arrived,
this is a brand new

19:57.630 --> 19:59.290
stromberg electronic
distributor,

19:59.290 --> 20:00.560
came all the way from England.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.160
These are actually,
the timing is right

20:02.160 --> 20:05.770
for a flathead, and
it bolts right up.

20:05.770 --> 20:09.270
It's really a nice piece, I'm
glad we were able to get it.

20:09.270 --> 20:11.000
I need to make quick work
of buttoning up the motor

20:11.010 --> 20:12.540
because the goal today
is to get it installed.

20:12.540 --> 20:14.170
Along with the transmission
and the drivetrain.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.980
What up, what up?
Oh, this lookin' good.

20:15.980 --> 20:17.310
Yeah, this turned
out really well.

20:17.310 --> 20:18.680
Richard: I've gotta jet out
of here pretty quick

20:18.680 --> 20:20.550
for the monster jam
event in vegas.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.250
We've got a monster
jam muscle car

20:22.250 --> 20:24.150
with the gas monkey name
all over it out there

20:24.150 --> 20:27.250
to compete in the 2018
monster jam world finals.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.590
It's one of the
many ways I create

20:28.590 --> 20:30.760
brand recognition for
gas monkey garage.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.490
But first, I've gotta
make sure that the '33

20:32.490 --> 20:34.630
doesn't go off the
rails when I'm gone.

20:34.630 --> 20:35.800
-The wheels look fine.
-Yep.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.000
What about the bed?
Oh,

20:37.000 --> 20:38.800
that turned out better
than I thought it would.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.630
Jason: Yeah,
that's what we thought.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.570
And we're gonna try to
match the seat to this.

20:43.570 --> 20:45.400
What's up with this color
on the dashboard here?

20:45.410 --> 20:46.740
That's the same color
that's on the motor,

20:46.740 --> 20:48.940
it's just blocked.
Where's the motor?

20:48.940 --> 20:50.840
Oh, rad.
Right there beside you.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.550
Like it?
Yeah, yeah.

20:52.550 --> 20:54.450
Did you tear in to it,
brian?

20:54.450 --> 20:56.450
Brian: Yeah, so I had to take
it all the way apart.

20:56.450 --> 20:57.920
We have a different
distributor set up now,

20:57.920 --> 21:00.120
that entitled taking
the entire thing apart,

21:00.120 --> 21:01.790
pulling the cam,
changing the cam.

21:01.790 --> 21:03.790
So it's all back
together now,

21:03.790 --> 21:05.930
it's got a better cam in
it than it had before.

21:05.930 --> 21:07.260
Okay.
I think it was a good move.

21:07.260 --> 21:08.930
Kick-ass, it's different.

21:08.930 --> 21:10.430
You know, as far
as all the colors

21:10.430 --> 21:11.930
we've got going on here, it
really does work together.

21:11.930 --> 21:13.430
Yeah, it is kinda
clown colors.

21:13.430 --> 21:15.070
That might be your
target audience here.

21:15.070 --> 21:16.800
This clown's been making a lot
of money, for a while.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.400
-This is true.
-I'm outta here, man.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.470
Y'all get goin'.

21:19.470 --> 21:20.670
It's a good thing
when richard's happy,

21:20.680 --> 21:22.210
because then he
stays out of our way.

21:22.210 --> 21:24.480
But happiness also gets richard
thinking about making dollars,

21:24.480 --> 21:27.510
and I'm not hot to
sell the '33 ford.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.420
But anyway, now we just
have to bolt the drivetrain

21:29.420 --> 21:31.550
to the motor, drop it in,
and we're home free.

21:31.550 --> 21:34.420
Line it up and start
bringing it down.

21:34.420 --> 21:36.060
There we go.

21:36.060 --> 21:38.060
But I spoke too soon,
turns out the engine mounts --

21:38.060 --> 21:39.760
they aren't the right size.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.090
It can never be easy.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.060
This mount hangs over
the front across from her,

21:43.060 --> 21:44.100
to get it where it
needs to be it needs

21:44.100 --> 21:45.260
to come back two
and half inches.

21:45.270 --> 21:46.870
Yeah, that's gonna be
a pain in the butt.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.000
It'll work.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.300
Well, our motor
mounts are brand new,

21:49.300 --> 21:51.770
off the shelf, and
as usual, we have

21:51.770 --> 21:53.840
to modify more stuff
to make it work.

21:53.840 --> 21:56.780
So we're about two
and a half inches

21:56.780 --> 21:57.880
too long on the motor mount.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.010
Hey, is there some special
nut

22:00.010 --> 22:01.150
that goes back here?

22:01.150 --> 22:02.550
According to
my calculations,

22:02.550 --> 22:03.820
this [bleep]
ain't gonna work.

22:03.820 --> 22:05.180
Yeah, four castle nuts,
they're probably laying

22:05.190 --> 22:06.250
on the floor around
here somewhere,

22:06.250 --> 22:07.320
so you'll have to go find 'em.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.020
Having trouble
putting on your nuts?

22:09.020 --> 22:11.190
Having trouble
getting the nuts on?

22:11.190 --> 22:13.230
-Jason?
-What do you want to know?

22:13.230 --> 22:14.790
We need the castle
nuts that go on this.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.060
They're around here somewhere.

22:16.060 --> 22:17.560
I didn't think you
did, 'cause you're

22:17.570 --> 22:19.200
the one who's yelling at
us for not bagging stuff.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.630
Jason: Yes.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.670
I took this apart after
it was on the floor.

22:22.670 --> 22:23.700
Okay, do you know
where those --

22:23.710 --> 22:25.540
yes, they're in
a bag over here.

22:25.540 --> 22:27.340
If I'd lost those
nuts at my shop,

22:27.340 --> 22:28.270
you can rest
assured they'd never

22:28.280 --> 22:29.540
see the light of day again.

22:29.540 --> 22:30.780
But, not around here.

22:30.780 --> 22:33.680
They'll be in a bag,
alphabetized and stuff.

22:33.680 --> 22:36.550
Each nut, this one was
top left, top right.

22:36.550 --> 22:38.880
What did I label that
as, driveshaft, under d.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.450
When I took it off,
it was torqued to, uh,

22:41.460 --> 22:45.020
14-foot pounds.
Okay, found 'em.

22:45.030 --> 22:47.860
Reason I forgot I found
'em is when I took 'em out,

22:47.860 --> 22:50.600
I sandblasted, prepped 'em,
and put what torque they're at.

if the car's still

So, it's the 2018 world finals,

23:17.860 --> 23:19.230

23:19.230 --> 23:20.860
And this is an event I haven't
gotten to go to before,

23:20.860 --> 23:22.530
we've had the monster
truck on the track

23:22.530 --> 23:24.200
for a couple years
now, and it just

23:24.200 --> 23:25.560

with my schedule.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.130
This is friggin' crazy.

Tonight, it's freestyle,

If I can make it to the end,
I'm gonna pull it off.

This is the last

24:00.600 --> 24:01.630

What about son-uva digger dude?
Is he here?

24:04.910 --> 24:06.240
Yeah, he's here.
He's been over there

24:06.240 --> 24:07.610

like always.

24:12.950 --> 24:14.310

we didn't either.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.180
Richard: The thorn in our side

There goes grave digger.

it and brake, and what have ya.

crush it, because

we entered in to a bet
with son-uva digger.

a couple trucks go for it.

complete the corkscrew

place with a 7.571, so,

31:31.990 --> 31:33.950
my father had one.
I knew immediately

31:33.950 --> 31:36.220
that it was a project that I
probably wanted to take on.

31:36.220 --> 31:37.720
Larry, what's up, man?
How you doing?

31:37.730 --> 31:39.560
I didn't see you
in the mix here.

31:39.560 --> 31:40.760
I was across the
street and I heard

31:40.760 --> 31:42.260
the guys out here
running this thing

31:42.260 --> 31:43.600
and I came over
and we just took it

31:43.600 --> 31:44.860
for a little test drive.

31:44.870 --> 31:46.230
What?
Yeah, you said

31:46.230 --> 31:47.570
you sell everything on
the test drive.

31:47.570 --> 31:49.130
He's not allowed to buy
cars, his wife told him

31:49.140 --> 31:50.240
he had to get rid of cars.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.100
It's true when I snaked --
I mean -- bought

31:52.110 --> 31:55.440
the f-150 from larry, he was
probably motivated by the fact

31:55.440 --> 31:57.210
that his wife is always
pissed off because

31:57.210 --> 31:59.040
he's paying for storage on
all these old cars.

31:59.050 --> 32:01.810
If she kicks me out, I've
got somewhere I can sleep.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.480
What are you
mike coy now?

32:03.480 --> 32:05.180
I slept in a lot of vans.

32:05.190 --> 32:07.020
Man, your wife
said no more cars,

32:07.020 --> 32:08.090
that's why you
sold me the truck.

32:08.090 --> 32:09.960
I did very well on
that, by the way.

32:09.960 --> 32:10.960
I hear.
I'm not the one

32:10.960 --> 32:12.190
that's gonna get
beat up by your wife

32:12.190 --> 32:13.730
or kicked out, so
I'll sell it to ya.

32:13.730 --> 32:14.830
What are you asking for it?

32:14.830 --> 32:16.660
These things
are really popular.

32:16.660 --> 32:18.500
Especially the short
ones like this.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.700
I think
the "good times" van

32:20.700 --> 32:22.270
are making a comeback.
I think so, too.

32:22.270 --> 32:23.600
I know larry's still
reeling from the fact

32:23.600 --> 32:25.600
that I made bank on
the shiner bock truck

32:25.610 --> 32:27.940
which I bought from him
for only 7 grand.

32:27.940 --> 32:29.310
So he's probably
gonna try to get

32:29.310 --> 32:31.010
back to me and play
hard ball on this one.

32:31.010 --> 32:32.210
So 15 grand.

32:32.210 --> 32:33.310
Oh, that's a good deal.

32:33.310 --> 32:34.850
I'm not gonna pay the $15,000.

32:34.850 --> 32:36.110
That's a little
out of my budget,

32:36.120 --> 32:37.650
I was thinking more
like $12,000.

32:37.650 --> 32:40.390
-No way.
-Look at those rims, come on!

32:40.390 --> 32:41.850
Thing about larry
is he is a car guy,

32:41.860 --> 32:43.320
which means I know he
can't keep his paws

32:43.320 --> 32:45.720
off a classic car for more
than about five minutes.

32:45.730 --> 32:49.160
I can go up to $13,000 but
that's -- that's my limit.

32:49.160 --> 32:50.500
Richard: Basically, I'll be
making 5 grand

32:50.500 --> 32:51.960
off of larry on a straight flip.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.800
And you know what I always
say about a bird in the hand,

32:53.800 --> 32:55.470
well, I'd rather
have 5 grand.

32:55.470 --> 32:57.240
I'll take it.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.970
Thank you, deal.

32:58.970 --> 33:00.610
You want me to call your
wife, or you gonna take it?

33:00.610 --> 33:03.780
I'm gonna put it in my storage
unit across the street,

33:03.780 --> 33:05.910
and my wife's not gonna find
out about it for a while.

33:05.910 --> 33:07.050
Perfect!
Lets go in and

33:07.050 --> 33:08.280
do some paper work and
you can give me some cash.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.820
Russell: Yeah, what's our
commission on that?

33:09.820 --> 33:11.620
Mike: Where's ours at?
We split a grand?

33:13.420 --> 33:15.420
-Now I need people.
-It'll take more than

33:15.420 --> 33:17.460
just me and you.
-You guys ready?

33:17.460 --> 33:19.890
-Question is are you ready?
-Born ready.

33:19.890 --> 33:22.130
Brian: Today's a critical
day because the plan

33:22.130 --> 33:25.460
is to get all the big pieces
of the truck back together.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.630
If there aren't any
major hiccups, we can get

33:27.630 --> 33:29.670
her fired up and make
richard's deadline.

33:29.670 --> 33:30.800
I like it man, I
think it's cool.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.540
Oh, so it goes in?

33:32.540 --> 33:34.340
I just want to get you to
hold the inside if you would?

33:34.340 --> 33:35.570
-Yeah.
-Mike's had little paint work

33:35.580 --> 33:36.940
on this old truck
so I've got him helping

33:36.940 --> 33:38.140
with final assembly.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.510
Richard:
See, that's the right idea.

33:39.510 --> 33:42.110
Put mike's big self down
there to keep the bolts down.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.020
Well, what do you think of
it with the cab on it, man?

33:44.020 --> 33:45.180
I'm digging it, man.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.590
Paint on the frame
looks better with it on.

33:46.590 --> 33:48.220
Yeah.
I was busting your balls

33:48.220 --> 33:49.250
the other day about
it not matching

33:49.260 --> 33:50.590
but I think it's
good when it's on.

33:50.590 --> 33:51.760
Well I'm gonna go rest.

33:51.760 --> 33:54.930
Okay, take a break.
Lay off the miller's.

33:54.930 --> 33:56.430
Don't y'all worry about me.

33:56.430 --> 33:58.300
Hey, what's going
on over there?

33:58.300 --> 33:59.530
I don't know, we gotta
come over this way.

33:59.530 --> 34:01.600
-What are you doing?
-This might be a problem.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.000
-Oh, my god.
-Yahtzee.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.370
Brian:
The truck's looking good,

34:04.370 --> 34:06.340
but there's still a ton
of stuff left to do.

34:06.340 --> 34:07.510
-Oh, yeah.
-This gon' be a cool

34:07.510 --> 34:09.540
little truck, man.
-Oh, yes.

34:09.540 --> 34:11.280
I've had the guys focused
on buttoning up the wiring

34:11.280 --> 34:12.610
and plumbing so we can
get the motor running

34:12.610 --> 34:14.110
by the end of the day.

34:14.110 --> 34:16.680
With the fluids topped off
and the fuel system primed...

34:16.680 --> 34:18.380
Any leaks?
Not that I see.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.620
Brian: ...We're ready to
give it some spark

34:19.620 --> 34:20.820
and see if she'll bust off.

34:20.820 --> 34:22.350
Let's see what happens.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.890
[ engine sputters ]

34:23.890 --> 34:26.890
almost!
That was pretty good first blow.

[ sputtering continues ]

Got something going on.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.100
Something.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.300
I don't know, the belt
broke or something.

34:38.310 --> 34:41.040
Oh, we broke
the crank pulley.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.370
I guess the belt was
a little too tight,

34:42.380 --> 34:43.640
that's really weird.

34:43.640 --> 34:45.710
It happened because the belt
we put on was too tight.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.850
[ laughs ]
yeah, thanks, captain.

34:47.850 --> 34:50.080
I think you schwarzeneggered
that belt on there didn't you?

34:50.080 --> 34:51.880
-Dude.
-But for a motor

34:51.890 --> 34:54.720
that richard bought site on
scene, off a truck in a crate.

34:54.720 --> 34:55.850
Fired up within the
first five seconds.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.090
-Yeah.
-Yeah, of all things

34:57.090 --> 34:58.490
to break, the crank
shaft pulley was like

34:58.490 --> 35:00.260
the last thing I would
think we would break.

35:00.260 --> 35:03.400
Well guess what, it
was the first thing.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.130
We're gonna have
to weld that up.

35:05.130 --> 35:07.870
Narrator: Coming up,
on "fast n loud"...

35:07.870 --> 35:10.700
23.9 cents a gallon.

35:10.700 --> 35:12.540
...It's back to

35:12.540 --> 35:13.710
I don't know,
you tell me,

35:13.710 --> 35:14.840
what do you
think the truck's worth?

35:14.840 --> 35:17.610
But can richard
sell the '33 ford?

35:17.610 --> 35:20.610
20 grand and a sign?
No way, man.

35:20.610 --> 35:22.210
You know it's worth
more than that.

35:29.420 --> 35:31.190
Don't look.

35:31.190 --> 35:33.460
You totally made it.
Did I?

35:33.460 --> 35:36.830
I didn't even look,
I'm good.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.660
So, no look.

[ laughs ]
that wasn't even close.

35:43.040 --> 35:45.770
Did I make it?
No.

No?
Not even close.

Damn it.

Nice truck daddy-o.

Hello, sir,
that'll be $2.62.

Per gallon?

36:51.040 --> 36:52.270
No, sir, that's your total.

That's like 19 cents

37:31.480 --> 37:33.110
there's not a lot

37:33.110 --> 37:34.480
but one thing I put
my money on

37:34.480 --> 37:36.650
time and time again is trucks.

37:36.650 --> 37:38.220
They'll always be cool.

37:40.690 --> 37:43.190
When we dragged this '33 ford
out of brian bass' shop,

37:43.190 --> 37:44.860
we knew we had something cool.

37:44.860 --> 37:46.690
We just didn't know
how cool at the time.

37:46.690 --> 37:48.230
I'm gonna call mater,
and have him come get it

37:48.230 --> 37:50.000
so you have a lot of [bleep] to
move to get it out of here.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.330
That's not part of the deal.

37:51.330 --> 37:52.630
I think these guys need to
stick around and help me.

37:52.630 --> 37:54.430
No, no, unh-unh, we're not
getting money for that.

37:56.170 --> 37:57.870
Our initial plan was
to build a functional

37:57.870 --> 37:59.440
period-correct shop truck.

38:01.610 --> 38:02.810
The first thing we
wanted to do was

38:02.810 --> 38:04.110
put some power into the truck.

38:04.110 --> 38:05.680
So we replaced
that old tired motor

38:05.680 --> 38:08.650
with a badass flathead v8 that
I had laying around the shop.

38:08.650 --> 38:10.250
With this flathead v8,
we needed to get some

38:10.250 --> 38:12.150
carbs over to us that
could handle the power.

38:12.150 --> 38:15.420
The strong bird '97 carburetor,
well it did just that.

38:15.420 --> 38:19.390
â™ª

38:19.390 --> 38:20.690
whoo!

38:20.690 --> 38:22.330
Now, as far as the
exterior of the truck --

38:22.330 --> 38:24.000
it looks so cool from
the get-go that for

38:24.000 --> 38:26.430
the most part we wanted to
keep it just like that.

38:26.430 --> 38:28.870
The classic look but with
a touch of hot rod cool.

38:28.870 --> 38:30.340
You know, gas monkey style.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.440
The original paint -- well, it
was patined into perfection

38:34.440 --> 38:36.470
which took nature years to make.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.680
That being said, I wanted to
dress up the truck exterior

38:38.680 --> 38:41.050
just a bit, so we added a
little touch of nickel plating

38:41.050 --> 38:42.480
to break up the patina.

38:42.480 --> 38:44.780
That combined with the larger,
commercial headlights

38:44.780 --> 38:47.150
we stole off a big truck,
and the paint we splashed

38:47.150 --> 38:49.450
on the wheels, well, this
truck's really set off.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.960
Keeping most of the original
look of the exterior

38:53.960 --> 38:55.560
was the right call,
but the rest of the truck

38:55.560 --> 38:57.230
was a different story.

38:57.230 --> 38:59.300
We updated the chassis
and interior to make this

38:59.300 --> 39:02.230
the most comfortable, badass
driving '33 truck around.

39:03.840 --> 39:06.400
I've said it many times before,
I wish I could keep them all,

39:06.410 --> 39:08.440
but I've also said many times
before that I gotta sell

39:08.440 --> 39:10.210
these cars to keep
the business going.

39:10.210 --> 39:11.910
So it'd be cool to
keep this '33 around

39:11.910 --> 39:13.280
to use as a shop
truck, but you know

39:13.280 --> 39:14.610
what's even cooler than that?

39:14.610 --> 39:16.210
A fat stack of cash in my hands.

39:16.220 --> 39:19.420
Sorry monkeys, no
'33 truck for you.

39:19.420 --> 39:21.320

dress that way?

from the future?

Nah, I think he's one
of them city folk.

while he's eating tacos.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.780
But most importantly, I
think I've got a buyer.

39:48.780 --> 39:50.620
My buddy, shawn, from
minnesota is here.

39:50.620 --> 39:52.720
Sorry brian bass,
but business calls.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.590
What's going on?
Not too much.

39:54.590 --> 39:55.790
It's rad, dude!

39:55.790 --> 39:57.860
I mean h&h flathead.

39:57.860 --> 39:59.320
Looks like
everything's brand new.

39:59.330 --> 40:01.730
My name is shawn nolan, I'm
from annandale, minnesota.

40:01.730 --> 40:04.160
For a hobby and stuff I
buy and sell old signs.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.500
Richard:
For some reason, I've gotten
into collecting vintage signs.

40:06.500 --> 40:08.430
And shawn's brought
me a cool one.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.000
You got the pictures?
Yeah.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.270
Oh, very cool.

40:11.270 --> 40:14.870
The sign is 25 feet tall,
it's absolutely insane

40:14.880 --> 40:16.540
its an old gas station sign.

40:16.540 --> 40:19.180
The last time it was turned on
was 1972

40:19.180 --> 40:23.450
and the gas price
was 23.9 cents a gallon.

40:23.450 --> 40:24.950
What do you want for this?

40:24.950 --> 40:26.520
5 grand.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.690
It's a beat up old sign.
[ laughs ]

40:28.690 --> 40:31.460
it's probably worth
up to $10,000 maybe.

40:31.460 --> 40:33.220
So how much you
want for the truck?

40:33.230 --> 40:35.490
Well, I want like 30
grand for the truck.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.660
So I know it's still
just an old '33 pick up

40:37.660 --> 40:38.960
but everything's new,

40:38.970 --> 40:40.800
everything's fresh,
killer interior.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.630
I'll take you for a ride.
Okay

40:42.640 --> 40:44.200
then we can talk numbers.
Okay.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.270
Richard: I totally dig
the sign, and to make

40:46.270 --> 40:48.210
sure shawn is just as
hooked on the truck,

40:48.210 --> 40:50.540
it's time for a little
test drive.

40:50.540 --> 40:57.450
â™ª

40:57.450 --> 40:58.880
heck yeah.

40:58.890 --> 41:05.520
â™ª

41:05.530 --> 41:06.860
so I took him for a
test drive in the truck

41:06.860 --> 41:08.960
before and flawlessly
he's really into it.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.430
We just gotta make a deal,
there's gotta be

41:10.430 --> 41:12.830
some middle ground there.
He's at 5 grand on the sign,

41:12.830 --> 41:14.800
and I'm at 30 grand
on the truck.

41:14.800 --> 41:15.830
I don't know, you
tell me, what do you

41:15.840 --> 41:16.940
think the truck's worth?

41:16.940 --> 41:20.240
20 grand and the sign?
No way, man.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.810
We just gotta make a deal,
there's gotta

41:21.810 --> 41:23.010
be some middle ground there.

41:23.010 --> 41:25.840
I just wanted to at
least be 25 and the sign.

41:25.850 --> 41:28.150
How about 25 and the sign?

41:28.150 --> 41:30.050
22.
25 and the sign,

41:30.050 --> 41:31.650
that's my offer.
Okay.

41:31.650 --> 41:33.250
Is that a deal?
Yeah.

41:33.250 --> 41:34.990
Alright, man.

41:34.990 --> 41:37.320
Let's go do some paper work
and we'll find some of my guys

41:37.320 --> 41:38.790
to undo this sign.

41:38.790 --> 41:41.390
Basically I had 20 to
22 grand in the truck

41:41.390 --> 41:46.060
and it may be worth 30, now
I've got 5 grand in a sign.

41:46.070 --> 41:47.800
That's probably worth
somewhere around 10 grand.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.400
That's way less
money on the table,

41:49.400 --> 41:51.300
and much more product coming in.

41:51.300 --> 41:55.410
So there you go,
23.9 cents a gallon.
