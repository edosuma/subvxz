WEBVTT

00:01.204 --> 00:03.305
Peter and I have
made a decision.

00:03.373 --> 00:04.873
We will be moving to Dubai.

00:04.941 --> 00:07.308
Thought anymore about joining
the ring of fire tour?

00:07.376 --> 00:08.343
I'm still thinking about it.

00:08.410 --> 00:09.544
So what are you saying?

00:09.612 --> 00:10.712
I'm thinking about
asking Ashley

00:10.780 --> 00:12.413
to be more than just
a girlfriend.

00:12.482 --> 00:15.550
I guess this doesn't
mean much anymore.

00:15.618 --> 00:18.520
I present you Mr.
And Mrs. Peter Morris.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.859
Ty!

00:24.926 --> 00:26.727
I don't ever want to stand
in your way, okay?

00:26.795 --> 00:28.362
It has nothing to do with
wanting to leave you.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.163
I just want to be on my own.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.098
You should go on that tour.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.266
I'm going to.

01:20.278 --> 01:21.345
Get up, cow!

02:33.246 --> 02:34.981
Hey, hey, come on, Spartan.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.440
Hello?

03:03.508 --> 03:04.642
Ty!

03:04.709 --> 03:05.943
What...?

03:06.011 --> 03:07.645
Oh no, you're kidding me!

03:08.579 --> 03:11.749
Yeah, of course!
But how are you gonna...

03:11.816 --> 03:14.051
Okay! All right,
I'll see you soon!

03:18.188 --> 03:19.321
<i>Grampa!</i>

03:20.024 --> 03:22.591
Grampa, Ty's coming home!

03:25.362 --> 03:27.163
I gotta go!

03:28.298 --> 03:30.299
Hey, get up here.

03:37.907 --> 03:41.109
I never
seem to get ahead of myself.

03:41.177 --> 03:44.412
Maybe now that Ty's back
things'll ease up a bit.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.814
And what is wrong?!

03:46.916 --> 03:48.249
I just...

03:48.317 --> 03:50.751
It's been two hours
since Ty called and...

03:50.819 --> 03:53.020
Well, there's
construction on highway 2.

03:53.088 --> 03:55.790
Mind you there's always
construction on highway 2.

03:59.661 --> 04:00.695
Ty!

04:12.840 --> 04:13.907

Hey Amy!

05:06.090 --> 05:07.658
Hey, this is my good
friend Connor.

05:07.726 --> 05:09.759
Uh, Blair Connor.

05:09.826 --> 05:11.127
<i>This is my girlfriend Amy.</i>

05:11.194 --> 05:12.362
Hi. Yeah, I've heard
so much about you.

05:12.429 --> 05:14.897
I feel like I know you already.

05:14.965 --> 05:16.432
And you must be Jack.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.934
Jack Bartlett.
Good to meet you, Blair.

05:19.002 --> 05:20.936
Aw, thank God for my motorcycle!

05:21.004 --> 05:22.372
Damn truck broke down

05:22.439 --> 05:23.573
just when we were about
to cross the border.

05:23.641 --> 05:24.774
We?

05:24.841 --> 05:25.674
Yeah, me, Connor and Grant.

05:25.742 --> 05:26.841
My boyfriend.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.143
<i>Yeah, he's awesome.</i>

05:28.210 --> 05:29.144
He's hanging out with
the truck right now so...

05:29.211 --> 05:30.379
He's gonna find someone
to fix it,

05:30.446 --> 05:32.681
but Ty just could not
wait to get home.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.082
I just hopped on my bike!

05:34.150 --> 05:35.417
How long do you figure?

05:35.485 --> 05:37.619
Uh, a day or two maybe.

05:37.687 --> 05:39.421
<i>Not long.</i>

05:39.489 --> 05:42.189
I hope I'm not putting
anyone out or anything.

05:42.257 --> 05:43.557
I just didn't want
to sit on the side

05:43.625 --> 05:44.858
of the motorway for hours.

05:44.926 --> 05:46.627
No, of course not.
No, you're welcome to stay.

05:46.695 --> 05:49.497
We've got a...
Well, a lot of empty rooms.

05:49.564 --> 05:51.299
Sweet. Thanks.

05:52.967 --> 05:54.669
Do you have any idea
how much I missed you?

05:54.736 --> 05:57.470
Well, actually,
I need you to tell me.

06:11.151 --> 06:13.052
Feels like we've been gone
for ever!

06:13.120 --> 06:15.120
Home sweet home.

06:17.056 --> 06:19.157
Well, maybe not so sweet.

06:21.093 --> 06:23.228
Caleb, can't we at least
unpack before getting into that?

06:23.296 --> 06:25.263
Well, this is bad, Ashley.

06:25.331 --> 06:26.431
Okay, it's bad.

06:26.498 --> 06:28.200
No, it's like...

06:28.267 --> 06:30.334
Really bad.

06:30.401 --> 06:31.902
<i>Look at these bills.</i>

06:31.970 --> 06:34.705
Well, maybe we can get my mom
to give us a small loan,

06:34.772 --> 06:37.441
I mean, if she ever starts
speaking to us again.

06:37.508 --> 06:39.276
No way.
This is my fault.

06:39.344 --> 06:42.713
<i>I didn't do half as good
on the circuit as I planned to.</i>

06:42.780 --> 06:46.249
By the next rodeo your leg will
be 100 percent back to normal

06:46.317 --> 06:48.751
and Soroya wants me working
back at Maggies

06:48.819 --> 06:51.221
so we'll be just fine.

06:54.725 --> 06:56.559
Well, I hooked up with
Connor and Grant in Utah

06:56.626 --> 06:57.961
and we hit it off right away.

06:58.028 --> 06:59.996
So we decided to travel
and work together.

07:00.064 --> 07:01.197
Yeah?

07:01.265 --> 07:02.430
And I got them jobs
exercising horses

07:02.498 --> 07:03.665
at the same ranch
that I was working at

07:03.733 --> 07:05.533
so it was a lot of fun.

07:05.601 --> 07:07.269
So you guys were all headed
here then?

07:07.337 --> 07:12.841
Yeah, well, they wanted
to see heartland and meet you.

07:12.909 --> 07:14.843
Chase powers
was on the tour too.

07:16.579 --> 07:18.145
Yes, he was.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.516
I'm really glad you're home.

07:22.584 --> 07:24.285
Me too.

07:24.353 --> 07:25.552
Did you miss me?

07:25.620 --> 07:26.653
Mmm...

07:26.721 --> 07:27.621
Come on.

07:29.291 --> 07:33.160
The other day I woke up
and I knew I had to come home.

07:33.228 --> 07:34.560
I missed you so much.

07:34.628 --> 07:36.062
I missed you more.

07:38.399 --> 07:40.033
Oh my God, Ty!
Do you remember this?

07:43.871 --> 07:46.439
We were in this county fair
in this little town in Utah

07:46.507 --> 07:47.440
and it was hysterical.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.075
Ty enters a donkey race,

07:49.143 --> 07:51.277
which he would have run
except this little kid...

07:51.344 --> 07:53.379
He couldn't have been
more than 4 or 5 years-old.

07:53.446 --> 07:55.881
And this little kid came
out of nowhere at top speed,

07:55.949 --> 07:59.184
passing everyone.
Ty's donkey goes crazy.

07:59.252 --> 08:00.786
It goes right of the course

08:00.853 --> 08:02.888
and I go into this like
hotdog concession stand thing!

08:02.956 --> 08:05.024
<i>And Ty gets covered
in ketchup and mustard!</i>

08:05.091 --> 08:07.792
It was so funny!
Donkey man.

08:07.859 --> 08:09.294
Donkey man. Nice.

08:11.964 --> 08:13.464
So how's it been going here?

08:13.532 --> 08:15.466
How's Lou and your dad and...

08:15.534 --> 08:16.534
- Lou's good.
- Yeah?

08:16.601 --> 08:17.936
Yeah, she's loving Dubai,

08:18.003 --> 08:20.738
living this crazy rich
and famous lifestyle.

08:20.806 --> 08:23.173
And dad, he should be back
from California any day now.

08:23.241 --> 08:24.841
He's actually been cleaning up
on the track.

08:24.909 --> 08:27.077
Can't wait to hear
all about that.

08:27.145 --> 08:29.779
So, Blair, working your way
across the country,

08:29.847 --> 08:31.214
what made you decide
to do that?

08:31.282 --> 08:32.515
Oh, I'm taking a gap year.

08:32.582 --> 08:34.484
Grant and I,
we both really needed a break

08:34.552 --> 08:36.153
so we decided
to go backpacking.

08:36.220 --> 08:38.087
I picked them up in Utah
in the pouring rain.

08:38.155 --> 08:40.556
Seriously crazy rain.

08:40.623 --> 08:42.357
And we've had so much fun,
like the three amigos.

08:42.426 --> 08:43.359
Three amigos!

08:44.727 --> 08:47.228
Three amigos.
That's so cute.

08:52.268 --> 08:53.501
She is trouble.

08:53.569 --> 08:55.236
Shhh, Mallory!

08:55.304 --> 08:57.105
Okay, I don't know
what Ty was thinking.

08:57.173 --> 08:58.974
Has he completely
lost his mind?

08:59.041 --> 09:00.942
Blair has a boyfriend, okay?

09:01.010 --> 09:02.977
Ty and her are just buddies.
That's it.

09:03.044 --> 09:06.546
Well that's what you think.
Things are never as they seem,

09:06.614 --> 09:08.515
especially when
it concerns boys.

09:08.583 --> 09:10.050
I should know.

09:10.118 --> 09:12.119
Badger has completely dropped
off the side of the planet

09:12.187 --> 09:14.355
and Jake is dating that
stupid little Chelsea bun.

09:14.422 --> 09:16.790
I don't see how that has
anything to do with this.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.828
Where's Blair?

09:22.896 --> 09:25.031
She's out in the field
befriending the horses.

09:25.099 --> 09:28.468
So, how come in all of your
texts and emails

09:28.535 --> 09:30.603
you never mentioned her?

09:30.670 --> 09:31.904
Yeah, I did.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.540
No, you always talked
about Grant and Connor.

09:34.608 --> 09:37.009
I just assumed that
Connor was a guy.

09:39.512 --> 09:42.447
Okay, was Blair the reason
that your three weeks

09:42.515 --> 09:44.149
turned into three months?

09:44.217 --> 09:45.250
No.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.551
It turned into three months

09:46.619 --> 09:48.853
'cause that's how much
time I needed.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.522
To what?
Find yourself?

09:50.589 --> 09:53.057
No, just to figure it out.

09:53.125 --> 09:55.059
I'm gonna get all the practical
experience I can with Scott

09:55.127 --> 09:56.860
before school in the fall.

09:56.928 --> 10:00.498
And the good news is I found
a great pre-vet program

10:00.565 --> 10:02.233
at the university of Calgary.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.967
So I can stay here.
I don't have to leave.

10:04.036 --> 10:05.569
Really?!
Yes.

10:05.637 --> 10:08.505
You're gonna stay here, Ty?!
Are you serious?!

10:08.572 --> 10:10.106
Yes.

10:12.809 --> 10:14.844
Oh God, I'm sorry, guys.

10:19.417 --> 10:20.883
Well, uh, who's this guy?

10:20.951 --> 10:23.385
Oh, it's Simcoe.
He's a friend's horse.

10:23.453 --> 10:25.454
Just be careful he has
a problem with real sudden...

10:28.024 --> 10:29.691
Movements and...

10:29.759 --> 10:31.226
Oh my God.

10:31.294 --> 10:32.227
Sorry.

10:32.295 --> 10:33.695
I'm working with him,

10:33.763 --> 10:35.931
but he's really strung out
and unpredictable.

10:35.998 --> 10:37.832
So it's
not going very well.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.034
Oh, right, yeah.

10:39.101 --> 10:41.835
Ty said you were
like a horse whisperer.

10:41.903 --> 10:43.003
Yeah.

10:46.775 --> 10:48.709
You guys probably want
some alone time.

10:48.777 --> 10:50.078
I feel like such an idiot.

10:50.145 --> 10:53.181
I'll catch up with you later.

10:56.850 --> 10:58.285
Chase powers.

10:58.352 --> 10:59.786
So he's the friend?

10:59.853 --> 11:02.689
Yeah, I've been working with
a few of his horses.

11:02.756 --> 11:04.091
Oh.

11:04.858 --> 11:09.429
That's something you didn't
mention in your emails.

11:10.498 --> 11:11.897
Well, I'm pretty beat.

11:11.965 --> 11:14.032
I think I'm gonna hit the hay.

11:14.101 --> 11:16.635
It's good to be home, Amy.

11:16.703 --> 11:18.971
See you in the morning.

11:27.580 --> 11:28.879
Hey.

11:29.915 --> 11:32.517
Uh, Bill Couchman.
Is Caleb Odell around?

11:32.585 --> 11:34.419
No, he's not.
Can I help you?

11:34.487 --> 11:35.753
I'm Mrs. Odell.

11:35.821 --> 11:37.589
I own the land that
this trailer sits on

11:37.656 --> 11:39.657
and the rent's been owing
for three months.

11:39.725 --> 11:41.192
Oh, really.

11:41.260 --> 11:43.160
I've come here a dozen times
and no one's ever home.

11:43.228 --> 11:45.162
Oh, well, that's because
we just came back

11:45.230 --> 11:46.296
from our honeymoon.

11:46.364 --> 11:48.098
We're newlyweds!

11:48.166 --> 11:50.000
Whatever.

11:50.067 --> 11:51.835
I want the rent caught up
by the end of the month.

11:51.902 --> 11:53.103
Oh.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.605
Well, we'll try,

11:54.672 --> 11:57.407
but a tiny extension
would be great.

11:57.475 --> 12:01.076
You know what it's like
to be young, poor and in love.

12:01.145 --> 12:02.678
No, I don't.

12:02.746 --> 12:04.213
I want my rent.

12:04.281 --> 12:06.649
And if you don't pay
it by the end of the month,

12:06.716 --> 12:10.520
you can be young, poor,
and in love somewhere else.

12:14.391 --> 12:15.857
Sorry, cowboy.

12:15.924 --> 12:17.959
So much for sweet talking him.

12:18.027 --> 12:20.629
How are we gonna come up with
three months worth of rent

12:20.696 --> 12:22.930
on top of the bills?

12:29.405 --> 12:32.806
Can I ask you one
simple question?

12:35.977 --> 12:38.579
Are you out of your mind?

12:38.647 --> 12:39.813
This Blair girl,

12:39.881 --> 12:40.914
how do you think
it looks to Amy?

12:40.982 --> 12:42.949
Relax!
We're just friends.

12:43.017 --> 12:44.251
Amy's fine with it.

12:44.319 --> 12:45.419
Is that so?

12:45.487 --> 12:46.587
Yeah.

12:46.655 --> 12:48.288
She trusts me just
like I trust her.

12:48.355 --> 12:50.856
Well, aren't we mature.

12:53.794 --> 12:56.128
<i>I expected you sooner.</i>

12:56.197 --> 12:58.598
What happened to a few weeks?

12:58.666 --> 13:00.966
It felt right
so I stayed a little longer.

13:01.034 --> 13:04.203
Well, it didn't feel right
from my end.

13:04.270 --> 13:07.172
I've been running this place
on my own.

13:07.240 --> 13:10.676
With Caleb gone, Lou gone,
Tim gone, you gone,

13:10.743 --> 13:13.078
Amy off on that tour...

13:14.013 --> 13:15.581
I hate to admit it,

13:15.648 --> 13:18.584
but this ranch work's getting
to be a bit much for me.

13:18.651 --> 13:21.285
Well, have you thought about
hiring a new hand or...

13:21.353 --> 13:23.354
Don't need. Got you.

13:24.289 --> 13:26.457
Well, no, Jack, uh,

13:26.525 --> 13:28.693
I'm gonna be working with Scott
and in the fall...

13:28.760 --> 13:32.162
Yeah, yeah,
university of Calgary.

13:33.665 --> 13:35.032
Amy told me.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.299
I can help you out
whenever I can,

13:36.367 --> 13:39.436
but this can't be
my main job anymore.

13:39.503 --> 13:41.504
So I get it if you need
me to move out of the loft

13:41.572 --> 13:43.206
to make room for someone else.

13:43.274 --> 13:44.874
No need.

13:44.942 --> 13:48.144
You know,
the whole time I was away

13:48.212 --> 13:50.947
I thought of this as home
and I thought about it a lot.

13:51.014 --> 13:54.583
Obviously not enough
to get your ass back here.

13:54.651 --> 13:55.751
Jack!

13:57.220 --> 13:58.854
Do you know if uh...

13:58.921 --> 14:01.323
This chase powers guy was at
all the shows that Amy was at?

14:01.391 --> 14:03.191
Oh.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.594
Not as mature as we think.

14:05.662 --> 14:06.995
I'm just askin'.

14:07.063 --> 14:11.299
Ah, as far as I know
he was at all of 'em.

14:11.367 --> 14:13.033
Okay.

14:13.101 --> 14:14.335
Please, Soroya,

14:14.403 --> 14:15.503
you know I wouldn't ask
for an advance

14:15.571 --> 14:17.104
if it wasn't serious.

14:17.172 --> 14:18.172
I'm sorry.
I just know my mom

14:18.240 --> 14:19.407
would never go for it.

14:19.475 --> 14:21.142
Well, you could at least
ask her, right?

14:21.209 --> 14:23.343
Well, I'll try,
but you just got back.

14:23.411 --> 14:24.444
<i>Val!</i>

14:24.512 --> 14:25.646
<i>Hi, how are you?</i>

14:25.713 --> 14:28.415
<i>I'm fine.</i>

14:30.752 --> 14:32.319
Mom?!

14:32.387 --> 14:35.155
Oh, Ashley, you're back!

14:35.222 --> 14:37.123
You're back! Oh honey!

14:38.793 --> 14:39.792
Oh!

14:39.859 --> 14:40.993
It's so good to see you.

14:42.329 --> 14:45.264
Other than the obvious
what's new?

14:45.332 --> 14:49.335
Um, the rodeo was fun
and Caleb was great.

14:49.403 --> 14:52.070
He's so good to me
and I'm so happy.

14:52.138 --> 14:53.306
Good.

14:53.373 --> 14:55.640
Um, but the honeymoon's
over now

14:55.708 --> 14:59.678
and we have a few little
rough spots to get over.

14:59.745 --> 15:01.346
Every marriage has those.

15:01.414 --> 15:03.281
And Caleb's accident
slowed him down

15:03.349 --> 15:06.751
so he didn't win as much
as he expected.

15:06.819 --> 15:07.919
So I...

15:10.122 --> 15:12.923
Um, might need a favour.

15:12.990 --> 15:14.891
Money?

15:14.959 --> 15:17.428
Mom, please, we need to talk.

15:17.495 --> 15:19.296
Did you need to talk
when you took off

15:19.364 --> 15:21.164
to some fly-by-night
justice of the peace

15:21.232 --> 15:22.499
and threw your life away?

15:22.567 --> 15:23.500
I'm sorry.

15:23.568 --> 15:24.601
Huh.

15:25.503 --> 15:27.837
You made your bed, sweetheart,

15:27.904 --> 15:29.772
lie in it.

15:29.840 --> 15:30.906
Mom!

15:38.081 --> 15:39.148
Giddy up!

15:40.651 --> 15:41.818
Giddy up!

15:44.453 --> 15:45.519
Hey, Simcoe!

15:48.190 --> 15:49.257
Hey!

15:52.394 --> 15:54.495
Simcoe.

16:04.038 --> 16:05.705
Good boy. Good boy.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.520
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:21.588 --> 16:24.123
You know, this horse
is driving me crazy.

16:24.191 --> 16:26.759
I get close to him and five
minutes later he runs.

16:28.128 --> 16:30.029
So did you call Grant
about your truck?

16:30.097 --> 16:32.830
I texted him but he hasn't
got back to me yet so...

16:35.534 --> 16:36.434
You're back!

16:36.502 --> 16:37.735
Hey, Caleb.

16:37.803 --> 16:39.104
Hi, Amy!

16:39.171 --> 16:40.505
Hey, man, congratulations!

16:40.572 --> 16:41.973
That's took a lot of guts!

16:42.041 --> 16:42.974
What? Getting married?

16:43.042 --> 16:43.741
Yeah.

16:43.809 --> 16:45.076
Naw, man!

16:45.144 --> 16:46.945
The best thing I ever did!

16:47.013 --> 16:48.212
<i>But, uh,</i>

16:48.280 --> 16:49.713
now that I am a husband
and provider,

16:49.781 --> 16:51.081
I've got a little appointment
with Jack

16:51.149 --> 16:53.850
so catch you guys later.

16:53.919 --> 16:54.851
Good luck.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.623
He's nuts. He really is.

16:59.690 --> 17:01.691
Yes, he is.

17:02.627 --> 17:05.395
Two seconds.

17:05.462 --> 17:07.530
<i>Hey, Blair, what's up?</i>

17:07.597 --> 17:09.598
I'm just outside. Okay.

17:16.473 --> 17:19.142
Don't you run away from me too.

17:21.481 --> 17:24.915
So you wanna come back full time?

17:25.819 --> 17:27.619
Yes sir.

17:27.688 --> 17:29.288
Do you actually
know the meaning

17:29.356 --> 17:30.824
of working full time?

17:30.891 --> 17:34.392
Doesn't that 8 second lifestyle
of yours apply pretty much

17:34.461 --> 17:36.962
to your entire philosophy
of employment?

17:37.029 --> 17:38.196
No sir.

17:38.264 --> 17:39.565
Not anymore.

17:39.632 --> 17:43.268
Besides,
I'm doing just fine on my own.

17:43.336 --> 17:44.603
Ty's back now.

17:46.305 --> 17:49.874
Jack, I'm not proud of this,
but I'm really low on money

17:49.942 --> 17:52.577
and I don't want to get
kicked out of my trailer

17:52.644 --> 17:53.978
and I've got a wife now.

17:54.045 --> 17:55.279
I understand.

17:55.347 --> 17:59.350
The weight of the world
is on your shoulders.

18:01.653 --> 18:03.187
All right.

18:03.254 --> 18:04.555
I'll take you back,

18:04.623 --> 18:07.123
but I don't know if can
pay you what I used to.

18:10.595 --> 18:12.295
Well, howdy.

18:12.363 --> 18:13.563
Caleb Odell.

18:13.631 --> 18:14.865
Blair Connor.

18:14.932 --> 18:16.533
<i>Pleasure.</i>

18:17.468 --> 18:19.636
Jack hired you back?
That's great!

18:19.704 --> 18:23.405
But we still can't come up with
the rent money on time.

18:23.473 --> 18:26.074
Look, we have to make
an effort with my mom

18:26.142 --> 18:29.545
I saw her today
and she was really ticked off.

18:29.613 --> 18:30.913
We have to talk to her together

18:30.981 --> 18:32.681
and make her understand
that we love each other

18:32.749 --> 18:33.949
and that we're gonna
make this work.

18:34.017 --> 18:35.217
Ash, I just...

18:35.284 --> 18:36.919
I really don't want to take
your mom's money.

18:36.987 --> 18:38.252
It'll just be a loan

18:38.320 --> 18:40.154
and now that we're both working

18:40.222 --> 18:42.289
we'll pay her back in no time.

18:42.357 --> 18:43.491
Please.

18:45.127 --> 18:46.193
You.

18:51.166 --> 18:52.834
He looks great!

18:52.902 --> 18:54.935
Man, who ever designed
that course was pretty tricky!

18:55.003 --> 18:57.103
But I think we're ready.

18:57.171 --> 18:58.104
You look ready to me

18:58.172 --> 18:59.305
and thank you for signing up.

18:59.373 --> 19:00.707
It's for a good cause.

19:00.775 --> 19:02.676
Oh, no problem.

19:02.744 --> 19:04.745
Excuse me, ladies.

19:04.812 --> 19:05.746
<i>Lisa Stillman.</i>

19:07.982 --> 19:09.549
The two amigos.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.951
<i>Have you noticed that
no boyfriend has showed up yet?</i>

19:12.019 --> 19:13.419
Doesn't that make you
a little bit nervous?

19:13.886 --> 19:15.955
No, it doesn't, Mallory.

19:18.959 --> 19:20.459
Any word on your truck yet?

19:20.526 --> 19:22.094
I just talked to Grant.
It's still in the garage.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.429
They're waiting on a part.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.629
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.130
Have you finished
practicing already?

19:26.198 --> 19:27.731
Yeah, I just did.

19:27.799 --> 19:29.467
Too bad.
I would have loved to watch.

19:29.534 --> 19:31.836
Actually, would you mind
if I checked out the course?

19:31.903 --> 19:32.937
Go ahead.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.072
Cool.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.942
Why would she check
out the course?

19:41.513 --> 19:42.446
What?

19:42.513 --> 19:44.481
Good homecoming, Ty.

19:47.952 --> 19:49.686
Hey Jack!

19:49.753 --> 19:52.356
Well, well, look what
the Santa Ana winds blew in!

19:52.423 --> 19:54.091
Aw, come on!

19:54.158 --> 19:55.692
How ya been?

19:55.759 --> 19:57.427
Pretty good.
How'd it go?

19:57.495 --> 19:58.961
Well, how didn't it go?

19:59.029 --> 20:00.463
I gotta thank you for freeing
me up for that adventure.

20:00.530 --> 20:01.697
It was a hell of a ride.

20:01.764 --> 20:02.831
Oh really.

20:02.899 --> 20:03.932
Yeah, that horse made
a name for me.

20:04.001 --> 20:05.634
And with that name comes talent

20:05.702 --> 20:08.137
and I found myself a star.
Best jockey I've ever seen.

20:08.205 --> 20:09.972
Rode lightning Dexter
to five wins in a row.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.674
So who knows? Maybe it's the derby next.

20:12.742 --> 20:14.209
Well, maybe.

20:14.276 --> 20:16.311
I don't have time to stand
around jawing with you.

20:16.379 --> 20:17.979
Ty's gone who knows where.

20:18.047 --> 20:20.948
Amy's off practicing on some
cross country course.

20:21.017 --> 20:23.118
I'm pretty sure that
I hired Caleb

20:23.185 --> 20:24.652
and he hasn't shown up yet
and you,

20:24.720 --> 20:26.454
you never helped matters
much by leavin'!

20:26.522 --> 20:27.688
You told me to leave.

20:27.756 --> 20:29.190
Yeah, well sometimes things
don't turn out

20:29.258 --> 20:31.425
the way you figure they should.

20:31.493 --> 20:34.061
Well, I'm back now
so I can help ya.

20:35.330 --> 20:36.330
Whoa whoa!

20:36.398 --> 20:37.464
Jack!

20:38.866 --> 20:39.699
You all right?

20:39.767 --> 20:40.867
Yeah.

20:44.339 --> 20:45.605
You all right?

20:45.673 --> 20:46.605
Yeah, I'm fine.

20:46.673 --> 20:48.441
Get him before
he's on the road!

20:53.213 --> 20:55.181
Here, put those frozen peas
on your ribs

20:55.249 --> 20:56.516
and you should
get 'em x-rayed.

20:56.583 --> 20:57.850
Oh right.

20:57.918 --> 21:00.619
Sit for hours in some
hospital emergency room.

21:00.687 --> 21:02.287
Well, it's not always
like that.

21:02.355 --> 21:03.821
Dad! Hey!

21:03.889 --> 21:04.956
Amy!

21:05.024 --> 21:05.790
- How are ya?
- I'm great.

21:05.858 --> 21:06.724
How are you doing?

21:06.792 --> 21:07.725
Good.

21:07.793 --> 21:08.693
Ty.

21:08.761 --> 21:09.794
Hey, this is uh...

21:09.862 --> 21:11.096
- Hi, I'm Blair.
- Hi.

21:11.164 --> 21:12.064
<i>We worked together in Montana.</i>

21:12.131 --> 21:13.231
<i>Hi.</i>

21:13.299 --> 21:13.965
What happened to you, Jack?

21:14.033 --> 21:15.200
Nothin'.

21:15.268 --> 21:17.469
He got kicked by a horse.
Stupid.

21:17.537 --> 21:18.436
What horse?

21:18.503 --> 21:20.504
Chase power's horse.

21:20.572 --> 21:21.838
Aw, great.

21:21.906 --> 21:22.873
I'm really sorry.
No one should go near him.

21:22.941 --> 21:24.942
Well, you shouldn't either.

21:25.009 --> 21:26.077
What?

21:27.011 --> 21:27.844
Never mind.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.646
Ty.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.484
Excuse me.

21:34.985 --> 21:36.052
Ty!

21:36.120 --> 21:37.720
Ty!

21:37.788 --> 21:39.655
Okay, so I'm working with
Chase's horse!

21:39.723 --> 21:40.790
So what?
Why are you trying feel...

21:40.857 --> 21:42.258
I just don't understand

21:42.326 --> 21:42.992
why you would be doing
that guy any favours!

21:43.060 --> 21:44.160
Because he's a client!

21:44.228 --> 21:45.562
His horse just kicked Jack!

21:45.629 --> 21:46.729
Put him in a trailer
and return it to him!

21:46.797 --> 21:47.863
No, you can't come here
and tell me...

21:47.931 --> 21:50.599
and tell you what to do?!

21:52.602 --> 21:54.436
Look, let's
just chill, all right?

21:54.504 --> 21:58.240
We're getting used
to being together again.

21:58.308 --> 22:01.143
Ty, you're the one who left.

22:02.078 --> 22:04.146
I know. I'm sorry.

22:06.748 --> 22:08.149
Come here.

22:08.883 --> 22:10.351
<i>Hey!</i>

22:11.620 --> 22:13.121
Are you guys okay?

22:13.188 --> 22:14.255
Yeah.

22:21.630 --> 22:25.999
So, um, this financial
bump is just that - a bump.

22:26.066 --> 22:27.300
And we're both working now

22:27.368 --> 22:28.835
so we'll be on our feet
in no time.

22:28.902 --> 22:31.704
It's just now it's a bit hard.

22:32.640 --> 22:36.276
And I know that this
is a huge thing to ask, but...

22:37.645 --> 22:40.379
Look, I have no doubt
that you're honourable

22:40.447 --> 22:42.981
when it comes
to paying back debts,

22:43.049 --> 22:44.750
so I am willing to help.

22:44.817 --> 22:46.385
Oh, thank you, mom,
you're amazing!

22:46.453 --> 22:49.688
However, I had hoped
that Caleb's accident

22:49.756 --> 22:51.490
would have convinced
him to look for other ways

22:51.558 --> 22:52.958
to make a living.

22:53.026 --> 22:54.059
Well, uh,

22:54.127 --> 22:55.893
I mean,
I'm working for Jack now.

22:55.961 --> 22:57.395
Right.

22:58.230 --> 23:00.931
And you can't possibly think
that waitressing at Maggies

23:00.999 --> 23:03.635
even counts as a job, Ashley.

23:03.702 --> 23:05.403
I mean, come on.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.639
You should get yourself
back to school.

23:07.706 --> 23:11.775
And you should at least
start learning a trade.

23:13.077 --> 23:14.144
A trade.

23:15.547 --> 23:17.481
You know...

23:17.549 --> 23:19.049
You both are wearing blinders

23:19.116 --> 23:21.451
as far as your future
is concerned.

23:21.519 --> 23:24.821
Of course I don't know
why I'm surprised.

23:24.889 --> 23:25.922
You're both still kids.

23:25.990 --> 23:27.423
I'm no kid,
Ms. Stanton.

23:27.491 --> 23:29.358
- Caleb.
- No.

23:29.426 --> 23:31.394
Look, Val,

23:31.461 --> 23:32.495
we really appreciate
you offering

23:32.563 --> 23:34.430
to give us a hand and all,

23:34.498 --> 23:37.433
but what Ashley and I do
with our life,

23:37.501 --> 23:39.302
well, that's up to us.

23:39.369 --> 23:40.636
Mm-hmm.

23:40.704 --> 23:42.737
Because your choices so far
have been stellar.

23:42.805 --> 23:43.838
Mom.

23:43.906 --> 23:45.273
Maybe not.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.542
But at the end of the day
they're our choices.

23:50.379 --> 23:52.080
You obviously don't need me.

23:52.147 --> 23:53.615
You're just fine on your own,

23:53.683 --> 23:57.085
living your life
the way you choose.

23:57.152 --> 23:58.885
Mom!

24:01.889 --> 24:02.723
I'm sorry.

24:09.831 --> 24:11.098
I should get going.

24:11.165 --> 24:12.700
Lot of last minute details
to take care of.

24:12.767 --> 24:14.967
I had two competitors
drop out today,

24:15.035 --> 24:16.603
two that I was really
counting on.

24:16.670 --> 24:18.271
Well, the course looks amazing.

24:18.339 --> 24:19.739
I walked it earlier.
Really professional.

24:19.806 --> 24:22.074
Oh, thanks.
Have you done cross country?

24:22.142 --> 24:24.410
Uh, actually, yeah,
I belong to a club back home.

24:24.478 --> 24:27.313
Well, please, sign up.
I could use the rider.

24:27.381 --> 24:29.282
Oh, I can't.
I don't have a horse.

24:29.350 --> 24:30.549
Well, you can have your pick
of the horses

24:30.617 --> 24:31.783
and I'm sure that Amy
has some gear

24:31.851 --> 24:33.785
<i>that you can borrow.</i>

24:33.853 --> 24:35.254
Nah, I don't think so.

24:35.321 --> 24:36.722
You should do it!

24:36.789 --> 24:38.523
Lise, uh, could you...

24:39.692 --> 24:41.192
Give me a hand with
some coffee?

24:41.261 --> 24:42.160
Sure.

24:42.228 --> 24:44.028
Think about it.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.800
Why did you have to go

24:49.868 --> 24:52.035
and get Blair involved
in the competition?

24:52.103 --> 24:53.904
Didn't you see the look
on Amy's face?

24:53.972 --> 24:55.539
No.

24:55.607 --> 24:57.541
I didn't know there was a
problem between those two.

24:57.609 --> 24:58.776
Oh!

24:58.843 --> 25:00.444
Oh! Oh, Jack!

25:00.512 --> 25:03.246
So you're really hurt.

25:03.314 --> 25:04.414
I think you're gonna
have to consider hiring

25:04.482 --> 25:05.782
some extra hands.

25:05.849 --> 25:06.583
I mean, this is all
just getting a bit too much

25:06.651 --> 25:07.850
for you at this stage.

25:07.918 --> 25:10.219
At my age? Is that
what you're tellin' me?

25:10.287 --> 25:13.855
No, this is a big job to run
this ranch at any age.

25:13.923 --> 25:16.392
I didn't think I needed
more hands.

25:16.459 --> 25:18.193
I figured once everybody
got back home

25:18.261 --> 25:20.462
it'd all be fine but...

25:20.530 --> 25:24.199
Well, it hasn't exactly worked
out that way, has it?

25:32.107 --> 25:33.174
Grampa?

25:35.844 --> 25:37.178
How are your ribs?

25:37.245 --> 25:38.212
Oh, good.

25:40.783 --> 25:42.283
Sorry about that horse.

25:42.350 --> 25:47.020
That was my own fault.
I wasn't paying attention.

25:48.356 --> 25:49.856
You know, I'm really not
getting very far

25:49.924 --> 25:51.991
with him either.

25:52.059 --> 25:54.394
I can't seem to concentrate
or something.

25:58.098 --> 25:59.932
And by the way that
Blair situation,

25:59.999 --> 26:02.134
I think you're handling
that pretty well.

26:02.202 --> 26:03.703
Right.

26:03.770 --> 26:06.305
Grampa, Ty is acting like
it's the most normal thing

26:06.373 --> 26:09.642
in the world to have her here.

26:09.710 --> 26:11.544
It's just...

26:11.611 --> 26:15.146
I feel like this
green-eyed monster.

26:15.214 --> 26:17.315
I don't want him to think
that I'm that girl,

26:17.383 --> 26:20.151
you know, jealous, insecure,

26:21.086 --> 26:23.755
even though I sort of am.

26:26.024 --> 26:27.492
I miss Lou.

26:30.662 --> 26:31.895
So do I.

26:34.466 --> 26:36.567
She'd know what to do.

26:36.634 --> 26:38.535
Yeah, she would.

26:47.266 --> 26:49.301
Honey, you're looking
good out there.

26:51.971 --> 26:53.104
Yeah, amazing.

26:53.171 --> 26:54.438
Thanks, guys.

26:54.506 --> 26:57.575
Go ahead, ask her.

26:57.643 --> 27:00.979
Were you serious before
about lending me a horse?

27:01.046 --> 27:03.615
Uh, yes, I'm serious.

27:03.682 --> 27:05.316
Okay, 'cause I
think I've reconsidered.

27:05.383 --> 27:07.350
Just watching Amy
I have to try it

27:07.418 --> 27:09.019
and Ty said
I'd be crazy not to.

27:09.087 --> 27:11.454
Okay, all right, good.
Then, uh,

27:11.522 --> 27:13.356
will you come with me and
we'll get her a horse.

27:13.424 --> 27:16.059
- All right.
- Great.

27:16.995 --> 27:18.095
Now watch
me fall on my face.

27:19.430 --> 27:20.897
No, the more competitors
the better, right?

27:20.965 --> 27:23.365
It's for a good cause.

27:25.502 --> 27:27.569
Blair, um, look I...

27:29.472 --> 27:30.673
I know you and Ty
are really close

27:30.741 --> 27:31.974
and that's-that's great.

27:32.042 --> 27:34.376
It is. I just...

27:34.444 --> 27:36.746
I want to make sure that
you understand that he...

27:38.681 --> 27:40.749
What?

27:40.816 --> 27:43.584
I guess what I'm trying
to say is that...

27:43.653 --> 27:45.620
You know what? I don't know
what I'm trying to say.

27:45.688 --> 27:47.722
Me and Ty?

27:47.790 --> 27:48.857
Wow.

27:51.027 --> 27:53.895
That's a bit old fashioned,
don't you think?

27:53.963 --> 27:55.328
A guy and girl
can't be friends?

27:55.396 --> 27:56.463
Blair...

27:57.999 --> 27:59.667
Thanks a lot.

28:10.078 --> 28:11.811
<i>So the mechanic
just got the part.</i>

28:11.879 --> 28:13.479
Grant says the truck should
be fixed by tomorrow

28:13.547 --> 28:15.948
or the day after at the latest.

28:17.017 --> 28:18.551
You done here?

28:18.618 --> 28:19.686
Yeah.

28:21.955 --> 28:23.690
Hey, Connor, you mind getting
a ride home with Lisa?

28:23.757 --> 28:25.758
Amy and I are gonna take off.

28:25.826 --> 28:27.125
Yeah, no problem.

28:27.193 --> 28:28.794
See ya.

28:28.861 --> 28:29.928
Okay.

28:33.700 --> 28:35.500
I like being the girl
on the back of the bike.

28:51.016 --> 28:52.482
Lou!

28:52.550 --> 28:54.384
I don't believe it!
What-?

28:54.452 --> 28:56.187
What are you doing here?!

28:56.254 --> 28:58.022
Peter had a business
trip to Tokyo

28:58.090 --> 29:02.058
so I grabbed a last minute
ticket and here I am.

29:03.094 --> 29:04.393
Hey!

29:04.461 --> 29:06.029
I didn't even know how much
I missed this place

29:06.097 --> 29:07.463
until I got out of the cab

29:07.531 --> 29:10.934
and I saw the house
and I smelt the air.

29:11.001 --> 29:12.368
Nothing beats it.

29:12.436 --> 29:13.803
Come on, I got you something.

29:13.871 --> 29:15.904
What? You got me something?

29:15.972 --> 29:18.440
Come on, tell me!
What is it?

29:27.150 --> 29:29.517
You gonna come to bed, babe?

29:29.585 --> 29:31.152
Nope. I'm reading.

29:34.422 --> 29:36.858
I really don't know
why you're mad at me.

29:36.925 --> 29:38.059
You don't?

29:38.127 --> 29:39.627
Mm-mmm.

29:39.694 --> 29:41.495
Well, let me tell you then.

29:41.563 --> 29:43.965
How could you say those things
to my mother?

29:44.032 --> 29:47.000
Everything was going so well
and you blew it!

29:47.068 --> 29:48.368
Well, it's not up to her

29:48.435 --> 29:50.070
to tell me I should
be learning a trade.

29:50.138 --> 29:51.337
I mean, what does she think
rodeo is?

29:51.405 --> 29:53.273
She thinks it's crazy
and dangerous.

29:53.340 --> 29:55.242
She acted like
I was a total loser.

29:55.309 --> 29:56.709
No, she didn't.

29:56.778 --> 29:58.044
Yes, she did.

29:59.280 --> 30:00.680
How do you think that
makes me feel?

30:00.748 --> 30:01.948
Like I can't provide for you.

30:02.016 --> 30:03.182
Oh my God.

30:03.250 --> 30:04.716
Ever since we got married

30:04.785 --> 30:06.852
you've been acting like
I'm your pet or something.

30:06.920 --> 30:08.154
That you need to provide for me

30:08.221 --> 30:10.689
like I'm your
responsibility now!

30:10.757 --> 30:12.024
You kinda are.

30:12.092 --> 30:13.425
No!

30:13.493 --> 30:15.828
I wasn't before we got married
and I'm not now.

30:15.896 --> 30:17.096
Don't go all

30:17.164 --> 30:18.963
"leave it to beaver" on me,
ward.

30:19.031 --> 30:20.398
Who's ward?

30:21.834 --> 30:25.069
I'm not your little wife
who needs protection.

30:25.137 --> 30:26.604
Look, I get that.

30:27.572 --> 30:29.040
I just don't want to start
our marriage off

30:29.108 --> 30:30.775
on the wrong foot.

30:30.843 --> 30:31.976
You know as well as I do,

30:32.044 --> 30:33.511
if we accept a loan
from your mom

30:33.578 --> 30:35.946
she's gonna own us.

30:36.014 --> 30:38.982
We agreed to get
my mom on our side.

30:39.050 --> 30:41.484
It's not just about the money.

30:41.552 --> 30:45.055
I don't want to be enemies
with her again.

30:45.123 --> 30:46.589
I need her.

30:47.826 --> 30:48.725
I miss her.

30:48.793 --> 30:50.593
I know, I know.

30:51.661 --> 30:53.562
We're gonna figure this out,
all right?

30:53.630 --> 30:55.031
I promise.

30:58.668 --> 31:00.169
Hey, kiddo.

31:00.237 --> 31:01.403
Hey.

31:02.372 --> 31:04.140
You were pretty quiet
at dinner.

31:04.208 --> 31:07.008
I've just missed you a lot.

31:08.277 --> 31:10.245
I missed you too.

31:11.214 --> 31:13.014
I've really had no one
to talk to.

31:13.082 --> 31:15.450
Well, you must be happy
Ty's back.

31:15.517 --> 31:17.552
Hey, I'm gonna
pack it in early.

31:17.619 --> 31:19.787
I just wanted to say it was
lovely to meet you, too.

31:19.855 --> 31:21.088
It was nice to meet you too.

31:21.156 --> 31:22.056
Goodnight.

31:22.123 --> 31:23.224
Night.

31:25.494 --> 31:28.863
Okay, what is the story here?

31:28.930 --> 31:30.630
I don't know.

31:31.666 --> 31:33.767
Hey, are you okay?

31:35.002 --> 31:36.102
Not really.

31:37.071 --> 31:38.104
Oh, honey.

31:39.073 --> 31:40.574
What is it?

31:40.641 --> 31:44.478
It's just that I've missed
Ty so much and...

31:45.446 --> 31:47.847
I imagined him coming home
in my head

31:47.914 --> 31:50.816
and it was gonna
be great and...

31:50.884 --> 31:53.919
It was nothing like
I expected and...

31:53.987 --> 31:57.356
And then I made a total
fool of myself today.

31:57.424 --> 31:58.957
How?

31:59.025 --> 32:01.159
Blair. I...

32:02.295 --> 32:04.629
I basically accused
her of being

32:04.697 --> 32:06.964
more than a friend to Ty.

32:08.934 --> 32:11.369
I don't know, I just...

32:11.437 --> 32:13.938
Why couldn't he have
come home alone?

32:14.006 --> 32:17.675
Lou, this was supposed
to be our homecoming and...

32:17.743 --> 32:20.377
It was completely spoiled.

32:20.445 --> 32:22.112
Okay.

32:22.179 --> 32:24.615
Everything you just said?

32:24.682 --> 32:27.150
Don't tell me, tell Ty.

32:34.792 --> 32:35.892
Hey.

32:37.661 --> 32:39.595
Can I talk to you?

32:40.497 --> 32:42.331
Yeah, sure, what's up?

32:44.134 --> 32:45.367
I know I shouldn't
be feeling this way,

32:45.436 --> 32:48.504
but I can't stop
thinking about it.

32:48.572 --> 32:49.872
Um..

32:50.706 --> 32:53.408
You and Blair,
was there anything at all

32:53.476 --> 32:55.877
between you guys when
you were travelling like...

32:55.945 --> 32:58.647
St be honest with me.

32:58.714 --> 33:00.315
No.

33:00.382 --> 33:02.551
Of course not.
We're just friends, Amy.

33:02.618 --> 33:03.652
Okay.

33:07.021 --> 33:09.924
Why did you bring her here, Ty?

33:09.991 --> 33:13.393
You know how much I was looking
forward to seeing you and...

33:13.462 --> 33:14.862
Amy...

33:14.930 --> 33:16.831
It's just we haven't had
a moment alone together

33:16.932 --> 33:19.467
since you got back and..

33:19.534 --> 33:21.101
It's just not fair!

33:21.169 --> 33:25.371
I didn't know Grant was gonna
take this long to get here.

33:25.439 --> 33:26.439
What could I have said
to her when she asked

33:26.507 --> 33:28.575
if she could come with me?

33:28.642 --> 33:31.110
You could have said no.

33:51.076 --> 33:52.877
<i>Hi, thanks for coming.</i>

33:52.945 --> 33:54.477
Lou!

33:54.545 --> 33:56.479
Hi! What a great surprise!

33:57.415 --> 33:58.415
Look at you all married.

33:58.482 --> 34:00.683
Oh my gosh, is it that obvious?

34:00.751 --> 34:02.719
No, you look fantastic!

34:02.787 --> 34:03.954
And you, Mr. ribs,

34:04.022 --> 34:04.922
can I give you
a good old tickle?

34:04.989 --> 34:06.924
Don't you dare!

34:06.991 --> 34:08.425
All right, well let's get
to the starting line.

34:08.492 --> 34:09.492
It's about to begin.

34:09.560 --> 34:10.993
Oh, okay, woo hoo!

34:15.532 --> 34:16.998
Good boy.

34:17.067 --> 34:18.600
Okay.

34:18.668 --> 34:21.070
I shouldn't have brought
Blair to heartland.

34:21.138 --> 34:23.205
I should have known
how you'd react.

34:23.273 --> 34:25.841
As in badly?
Thanks.

34:25.909 --> 34:26.975
No.

34:29.011 --> 34:32.647
I guess anyone would have
reacted that way.

34:32.714 --> 34:36.318
I need you to know that there's
nothing going on, okay?

34:36.385 --> 34:38.186
Wish me luck, Ty.

34:39.788 --> 34:42.522
<i>And we have our
first rider on course!</i>

34:42.590 --> 34:46.092
<i>Number 612!
Mary Kane riding apache!</i>

34:47.929 --> 34:50.130
This should be fun.

34:50.197 --> 34:51.297
Mm-hmm.

34:51.366 --> 34:53.533
<i>Next up is 607!</i>

34:54.469 --> 34:55.601
Lots of people.

34:55.670 --> 34:56.870
Yeah.

34:56.938 --> 34:57.604
<i>...On Cote D'Azur!</i>

34:59.773 --> 35:01.474
I'm just warning you I'm...

35:01.541 --> 35:04.143
I'm pretty competitive.

35:04.211 --> 35:08.081
Yeah, well you haven't
seen anything yet.

35:08.148 --> 35:13.052
<i>And now on course 608!
Amy Fleming riding spartan!</i>

35:16.055 --> 35:17.422
<i>There she goes!</i>

35:17.490 --> 35:19.791
Go Amy! Let's go!
Come on, honey!

35:19.859 --> 35:24.729
<i>And we have 609!
Blair Connor on new castle!</i>

36:21.650 --> 36:24.285
<i>Yah! Yah!</i>

36:25.954 --> 36:27.221
Whoa, easy.

36:28.857 --> 36:29.924
Are you okay?

36:29.991 --> 36:31.759
Yeah, I'm fine.

36:38.966 --> 36:40.633
No, don't! I'm fine!

36:42.603 --> 36:44.003
Blair, you're disqualified.

36:44.072 --> 36:45.705
You shouldn't have done that.
I'm fine.

36:45.773 --> 36:48.708
Let's get you up before
we both get trampled on.

36:48.776 --> 36:49.842
Come on.

36:51.144 --> 36:52.078
Thanks.

36:52.145 --> 36:53.312
No problem.

36:53.380 --> 36:54.814
No, it is a problem.

36:54.882 --> 36:56.248
You probably would have won
if you hadn't have done that.

36:56.316 --> 36:58.585
No, it's nothing a friend
wouldn't do.

36:58.652 --> 36:59.886
Besides,

36:59.954 --> 37:02.755
I don't have to win
all the time.

37:06.093 --> 37:09.294
<i>All right, honey, just
listen to me for a second, okay?</i>

37:09.361 --> 37:12.064
I know that Caleb and I have
our differences,

37:12.131 --> 37:14.432
but you shouldn't have
to suffer for that.

37:14.500 --> 37:15.533
Mom, I'm...

37:15.602 --> 37:18.103
No just-
just hear me out.

37:19.038 --> 37:20.939
This is more than
three months rent.

37:21.007 --> 37:22.540
It should hold you for a while,

37:22.608 --> 37:25.843
and I know you'll pay me back.

37:25.911 --> 37:29.480
You don't have to rush though,
okay?

37:32.083 --> 37:33.817
Thank you, mom.

37:34.852 --> 37:37.721
I'm sorry.
I can't accept this.

37:37.788 --> 37:39.423
Caleb doesn't want to start
married life

37:39.491 --> 37:41.858
in debt to you and...

37:41.926 --> 37:43.793
I think he's right.

37:43.861 --> 37:45.428
So now he's...

37:48.365 --> 37:50.199
Now he's made you feel bad
about accepting help

37:50.267 --> 37:52.368
from your mother.

37:52.436 --> 37:55.104
What kind of a man is that,
Ashley?

37:55.172 --> 37:57.906
A proud one?

37:57.974 --> 38:00.075
Well, you know what pride
goes before, don't ya?

38:00.144 --> 38:01.209
I...

38:03.312 --> 38:06.381
Whatever.
Just trying to help.

38:08.384 --> 38:09.951
You okay?

38:11.053 --> 38:15.056
I just hate it
when she might be right.

38:21.129 --> 38:23.096
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:23.165 --> 38:25.332
Thanks again for helping
Amy out on the course.

38:25.400 --> 38:27.301
Like I wouldn't?

38:28.336 --> 38:31.738
Well, thanks anyway.

38:42.149 --> 38:43.216
Uh...

38:46.587 --> 38:48.688
What was that?

38:48.755 --> 38:51.356
You know what that was.

38:51.424 --> 38:52.791
No, I don't, um...

38:52.858 --> 38:54.626
Oh, come on, Ty.

38:55.562 --> 38:57.162
It's been there since the moment
you picked me up in that rain.

38:57.230 --> 38:59.431
I know it.
You know it.

38:59.499 --> 39:01.233
Uh, Connor...

39:01.301 --> 39:02.901
Look, that's why I wanted
to come here with you

39:02.968 --> 39:05.536
and not wait with Grant.

39:07.105 --> 39:10.374
Look, I think I'm falling
in love with you.

39:10.442 --> 39:12.109
Okay...

39:12.177 --> 39:14.679
Stop, okay, um...

39:14.746 --> 39:17.215
Blair, you have a boyfriend
and I have a girlfriend.

39:17.282 --> 39:19.217
Let's just keep this
at a friendship thing.

39:19.284 --> 39:20.718
No.

39:20.785 --> 39:24.721
No, you feel something for me.
I know. I can tell.

39:24.788 --> 39:27.190
I like you a lot, but...

39:29.193 --> 39:30.260
I...

39:32.796 --> 39:34.531
You led me on.

39:36.166 --> 39:37.700
No, I didn't.

39:38.635 --> 39:40.369
And I'm sorry
if you thought that I...

39:40.437 --> 39:42.137
You're sorry?

Ah, well, make it short.

41:06.084 --> 41:07.385
We need a lift

Well, so soon?

41:11.989 --> 41:15.425

I should tell you or not,

but my mother gave me a cheque

41:36.579 --> 41:39.248

Well, you did the right thing.

I'm proud of you.

41:45.087 --> 41:46.787
By the way,
I talked to Bill Couchman

41:46.855 --> 41:50.958
and he's gonna give
us an extension on the rent.
