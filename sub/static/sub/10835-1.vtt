And he's being a big bitch
about the fact that I haven't

08:27.048 --> 08:29.301
turned in my book report
on A Tale of Two Cities.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.385
Oh, I love
that book.

08:30.427 --> 08:31.386
(chuckles)
Good one.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.804
I did a paper
on it last year.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.347
Doesn't matter.
I'm gonna get it done next week.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.932
I've been telling him that.
He just doesn't listen.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.308
My mom's gonna
take care of it, and...

08:37.351 --> 08:38.477
Ethan!

08:38.518 --> 08:39.477
Hi, honey.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.479
I was looking

08:40.520 --> 08:42.022
all over for you
this morning.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.357
Uh...

08:43.398 --> 08:44.483
Completely got busted
by Matthews.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.151
(chuckles)
Where were you?

08:46.193 --> 08:48.987
Uh, I, uh, just had
some lacrosse stuff to do.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.156
ETHAN:
Well, I'm sorry.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.241
Ethan, this is Annie, the
new principal's daughter.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.534
Annie, my
boyfriend Ethan.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.077
Yeah, well, actually,
yeah, we-we know each other.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.996
Yeah, we...
We met, like, two summers ago?

08:58.038 --> 08:59.664
Yeah, our, uh, grandmothers
are friends.

08:59.706 --> 09:00.665
Oh, so you've
hung out.

09:00.707 --> 09:01.749
ANNIE:
Yeah!
Well, I mean...

09:01.791 --> 09:02.876
Uh, just a little.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.419
Adrianna!
Not-not really.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.671
Come here.
Uh, this is Annie.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.006
You guys should meet,
'cause, uh,
Hi!

09:08.048 --> 09:09.007
Hi.
she's... you're into
plays, right?

09:09.049 --> 09:11.009
Yeah.
NAOMI:
You're into plays?

09:11.051 --> 09:12.844
Well, Adrianna's the lead
in Spring Awakening,

09:12.886 --> 09:14.762
our musical here
at the school.
Oh, my God!

09:14.804 --> 09:16.056
Really? Ugh.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.682
I'm so jealous.
I love Spring Awakening.

09:17.724 --> 09:18.683
I really wanted
to audition,

09:18.725 --> 09:20.894
but I moved here too late.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.354
Actually,
I had to leave

09:22.396 --> 09:23.688
my play back home.

09:23.730 --> 09:24.772
And what was that?

09:26.774 --> 09:29.403
♪ I'm very good at integral
and differential calculus ♪

09:29.444 --> 09:32.113
♪ I know the scientific names
of beings animaloulous. ♪

09:32.155 --> 09:34.157
Um...

09:34.199 --> 09:36.868
it was this, uh, new, edgy

09:36.910 --> 09:38.412
Rent-ish thing.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.414
Anyway... (chuckles)

09:40.455 --> 09:42.207
I'm doing scenery and stuff now.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.958
Oh.
(chuckles)

09:44.000 --> 09:46.253
Well, that seems like
the perfect place for you.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.712
NAOMI:
Well, it was a
pleasure, Annie.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.423
Ethan?
Uh, yeah.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.424
We'll see you around, Annie.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.632
It was, uh...
We'll talk.

09:51.674 --> 09:52.633
Great.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.471
They are such an
amazing couple.

09:56.513 --> 09:57.472
(school bell ringing)

09:57.514 --> 09:58.390
(sighs)

10:03.562 --> 10:05.522
Are you lost?

10:05.564 --> 10:06.773
Completely.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.671
So.

10:30.713 --> 10:31.965
Hi.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.258
Uh, how's your day going?

10:33.300 --> 10:34.593
Apparently not as good as yours.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.594
Yeah, listen,

10:35.635 --> 10:36.761
I want to explain.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.597
Uh, you don't need
to explain a thing.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.598
No, I-I feel like I do.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.933
If you're gonna
tell Naomi...

10:41.975 --> 10:43.435
Uh, I'm not gonna tell her.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.769
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.188
Wow, that's
really cool.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.649
Look, I'm not that guy.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.234
What guy?
Uh...

10:53.069 --> 10:54.988
Can't get enough
of this guy.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.197
See you around, Annie.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.125
I accidentally
grabbed your book.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.210
Yeah, I think
I grabbed yours, too.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.635
Listen, time's up.
You owe $200.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.386
Needs it by tomorrow.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.888
Well, I don't have that.

11:23.724 --> 11:24.809
But I'll get it.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.936
Tomorrow.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.855
I'll get it.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.275
GIRL:
What's this?

11:33.443 --> 11:34.986
A notebook.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.071
No, this.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.240
A Division Day sticker.

11:39.282 --> 11:40.741
That's impossible.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.577
They have like eight fans total.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.205
Where'd you get
the sticker, new kid?

11:45.246 --> 11:48.249
Brandon Flowers put one of their
songs on his celebrity playlist.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.168
And can you get your foot
off my notebook?

11:50.210 --> 11:51.836
Oh, tough girl.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.796
Nice.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.756
That's exactly how I found them.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.008
Thank you.
What?

11:57.050 --> 11:58.510
Have some fries.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.387
Will do. I'm Silver.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.596
Silver?

12:01.638 --> 12:04.182
Well, you can call me Erin,

12:04.224 --> 12:05.975
but I'm not gonna respond.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.603
So, look,
I wasn't planning

12:08.645 --> 12:10.230
on making you
feel welcome here,

12:10.271 --> 12:12.190
but then I saw the sticker,
and I thought,

12:12.232 --> 12:13.233
hey, maybe the
principal's daughter

12:13.274 --> 12:14.693
isn't such a big loser
after all.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.110
(chuckles)
Thanks.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.529
You'll learn to dig me--
trust me.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.488
Yeah.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.700
I need you now, pronto.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.410
Come on.
Hey, Naomi.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.119
Hey, oh, if you need
some help later

12:25.161 --> 12:26.371
turning those
Wheel of Fortune letters,

12:26.413 --> 12:27.914
I can totally
carve out some time.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.167
Hey, sis.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.675
What's going on?
I'm saving you.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.927
She's out of her mind, and
you should not trust her.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.095
She has this Web site,

12:42.136 --> 12:43.722
and she makes messed-up
videos of people.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.557
Really? She seemed
so nice to me.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.725
Yeah, that's her MO.

12:46.765 --> 12:49.018
So, listen, Ethan told
me how cool you are

12:49.060 --> 12:50.562
and how you're
practically like family,

12:50.604 --> 12:53.398
so I decided I'm
gonna invite you

12:53.440 --> 12:54.733
to my birthday party,

12:54.773 --> 12:57.485
my not-so-sweet 16
birthday party.

12:57.527 --> 12:58.695
It's this Friday.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.739
It's going to be
the night of your life.

13:00.779 --> 13:01.780
What do you say?

13:01.822 --> 13:03.824
Oh, my God,
I'd love to.

13:03.866 --> 13:04.867
Of course you would,

13:04.909 --> 13:06.244
but you're gonna
need new clothes,

13:06.286 --> 13:07.704
so we'll go shopping
after school.

13:07.746 --> 13:10.081
Oh.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.417
I just don't get why this paper
can't wait till next week.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.918
Naomi's got a huge
birthday party,

13:13.960 --> 13:15.920
and I don't want her
all stressed out for it.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.380
Come on, man.
It's a birthday party

13:17.422 --> 13:18.590
for a spoiled
little princess.

13:18.632 --> 13:19.966
I got it, Mr. Matthews.

13:20.007 --> 13:22.594
Harry, we've spent
a fortune on this party.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.763
Surely, there's something
you can do for us.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.973
(chuckles)
She didn't do the assignment.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.475
What am I missing here?

13:28.516 --> 13:30.101
Just have her write
the paper, Charlie.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.144
Nonnegotiable.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.604
I'm taking this
up to the board

13:32.646 --> 13:34.397
because you're
being ridiculous.

13:38.652 --> 13:39.986
Ironic, isn't it, Harry?

13:40.027 --> 13:41.279
If things had
happened differently,

13:41.321 --> 13:43.990
we'd be talking about our kid.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.787
Yowza.

13:48.827 --> 13:49.996
Whoa.

13:50.037 --> 13:52.123
A lot going on there, huh?
I would get back

13:52.165 --> 13:54.334
to your class
if I were you, Mr. Matthews.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.795
See you around.

13:56.835 --> 13:58.588
(sighs)

14:01.549 --> 14:05.136
Mrs. Clark and I went out
for a bit back in high school.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.013
(suppressed giggling)

14:18.650 --> 14:21.194
I'm never gonna learn
to work this machine.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.404
Whatever happened
to regular coffee?

14:23.446 --> 14:24.823
Willie!

14:24.864 --> 14:27.659
And you really do that
when you go online?

14:27.701 --> 14:29.076
Ethan loves it.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.121
I do everything to that boy.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.247
I should do more, actually.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.541
He's been
a little distant lately.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.795
Uh, hey, uh, listen,

14:38.837 --> 14:41.047
thanks so much
for taking me out.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.465
No problem.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.509
(phone ringing)
Hello, I had fun.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.844
I just really wish

14:45.885 --> 14:47.554
you would've let me
buy you that dress.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.013
It looked amazing on you.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.390
I cannot let you buy me

14:50.431 --> 14:51.932
an $800 dress.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.852
My dad would...
Are you kidding me?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.353
What?
My mom just texted me.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.564
I have to write that paper
for Matthews by tomorrow.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.524
How much have you written?

14:59.566 --> 15:01.192
I haven't even started yet!

15:01.234 --> 15:03.695
Oh, my God, I-I...
I can't do this right now.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.196
This is so not what I need.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.365
I mean, I know
if I just sat down

15:07.407 --> 15:09.200
and started writing it,
that I could get it done,

15:09.242 --> 15:10.368
but thinking
about staring

15:10.410 --> 15:11.703
at a blank piece of paper...

15:11.745 --> 15:12.746
What am I gonna do?

15:15.248 --> 15:16.666
Well, I can help.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.335
I told you, I got an "A"
on that paper last year,

15:19.377 --> 15:21.045
so I can give it to you,

15:21.087 --> 15:22.714
and you can take
some ideas from it.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.048
Really?

15:24.090 --> 15:25.216
(sighs)

15:25.258 --> 15:26.885
That would be so awesome.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.845
Sure... that way, you can see
what it should look like.

15:28.887 --> 15:29.888
I'll just email it to you

15:29.929 --> 15:31.097
when I get home.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.932
Oh, my God,
you are a lifesaver.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.142
Thank you so much.
You're such a good friend.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.733

MATTHEWS:
Come on, man.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.736
Keep it going.
Stay on him. There you go.

Yo, man, you got
some sick moves.

Thanks, Ethan.

MATTHEWS:
All right, Wilson,

16:32.325 --> 16:33.367
you made the team.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.119
Why don't you roll
with the ones, George?

16:35.161 --> 16:37.789
Why don't you drop down
to the twos for now?

16:37.831 --> 16:39.624
Come on, guys, you
can make out later.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.417
Let's keep playing.
Let's go!

16:49.216 --> 16:50.969
Hey, come on, George.

Hey, guys, hey,
break it up!

Did you kick his ass?

17:13.449 --> 17:14.659
Mom.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.076
What, that's not
the first thing

17:16.117 --> 17:18.454
you thought of when you heard
he was in a fight?

17:18.496 --> 17:20.122
Then, maybe that's why
he lost.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.374
I didn't lose.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.750
Never worry about being fair.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.210
Just grab on
to those jewels,

17:24.251 --> 17:26.462
and twist them
like a garbage bag.

Okay, okay.

He checked me first.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.762
Well, you have got
to control your anger.

17:34.804 --> 17:35.930
People don't know you here.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.223
They're gonna judge you
more harshly.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.307
I just reacted.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.852
I say it was racially motivated.
Mom.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.564
HARRY:
Look,

17:44.605 --> 17:46.399
I'm gonna talk
to your coach tomorrow.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.817
We'll get this all worked out.

17:47.859 --> 17:50.110
And make sure he's not
too rough on our baby.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.739
Yeah, 'cause he
is such a delicate flower.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.073
(chuckling)

17:54.114 --> 17:55.115
ANNIE:
So listen,

17:55.157 --> 17:56.868
you guys are cool with me going

17:56.910 --> 17:58.494
to Naomi Clark's
amazing birthday party

17:58.536 --> 17:59.746
tomorrow night, right?

17:59.787 --> 18:01.789
Well, that was fast--
I mean, Harry,

18:01.831 --> 18:03.708
do you know
this girl?
Yeah, I know her family.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.920
You can go.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.671
Thanks, Dad.

18:08.713 --> 18:09.797
TABITHA:
Well, I'm going

18:09.839 --> 18:12.008
to call Dan Tana's
for some takeout...

18:12.050 --> 18:14.677
not that your tater tots
aren't to die for.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.477
Whoa.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.520
(chuckles)

18:24.562 --> 18:28.107
You cannot tell anybody.
You saw that?

18:28.148 --> 18:29.776
Oh, I saw that.
(laughing)

18:29.817 --> 18:31.819
Oh, I saw
all of that.
Wow.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.153
The thing is,
I totally don't get

18:33.195 --> 18:34.697
why Ethan would cheat
on someone like Naomi.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.115
Believe me...

18:36.156 --> 18:38.409
if a dude is cheating
on a chick like that,

18:38.451 --> 18:40.036
he doesn't want
to be with her anymore.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.621
But she's so beautiful.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.957
That doesn't mean
she's not a pain in the ass.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.708
(both laughing)

18:50.170 --> 18:52.548
I love that dress.
Oh, you know me,
Adrianna.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.216
Early birthday present
to myself from myself.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.802
Aren't I nice?

18:55.843 --> 18:56.803
Uh, here, let me, uh...

18:56.844 --> 18:57.971
let me get this one, ladies.

18:58.012 --> 18:59.973
No, baby,
it's on me tonight.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.933
You guys get the table;
I'll get the drinks.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.476
Thank you.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.561
(phone ringing)
This is gonna
be so much fun.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.654
Excuse me.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.447
How'd you get up here?

19:18.032 --> 19:19.993
I could ask the same
question about you.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.410
You're just a teacher;
didn't the cover charge

19:21.452 --> 19:22.745
eat up your
month's salary?

19:22.787 --> 19:24.705
You should try applying
some of that caustic wit

19:24.747 --> 19:26.206
to your term paper
that's due tomorrow.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.458
Actually, it's done.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.669
I decided it was better
to do it than to fight it.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.088
Well, I cannot wait
to read that masterpiece.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.758
You know, why are you always
so mean to me?

19:35.800 --> 19:37.426
Who says I'm being mean?

19:38.552 --> 19:39.929
She's underage.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.055
Don't serve her.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.975
Oh, I guess that was mean.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.434
Oops.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.107
(doorbell ringing)

19:52.232 --> 19:54.110
Welcome wagon.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.699
So, then, Harry...

19:59.740 --> 20:01.367
what were we, like 17?

20:01.408 --> 20:02.535
I don't know.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.537
Uh, you know, maybe
we should call it...

20:04.578 --> 20:05.705
So, then, Harry decides

20:05.746 --> 20:06.706
that he wants
to climb

20:06.747 --> 20:08.082
on the "H" of the
Hollywood sign

20:08.124 --> 20:09.709
because he thinks it looks
like a ladder.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.128
Well, the whole thing
comes crashing down,

20:12.170 --> 20:14.463
and he slides on it
for like 50 feet.

20:14.505 --> 20:16.465
Oh, my God, did we laugh.

20:16.507 --> 20:19.093
I mean, he's lucky
he wasn't killed.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.344
Well, that was
a long time ago.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.387
Can I call you a cab?

20:21.428 --> 20:24.057
Oh, I have a
better idea.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.808
Why don't you drive me home?

20:25.850 --> 20:28.310
Ooh, or even better,
I could drive you home,

20:28.352 --> 20:31.147
and we could swap stories
about Harry's penis.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.401
I have enough of my own.
Thank you.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.945
I'll see myself out.
Good night.

20:37.987 --> 20:40.114
(clearing throat)

20:40.156 --> 20:41.574
Uh...

20:41.615 --> 20:43.826
Okay, don't you ever
give me grief

20:43.868 --> 20:46.120
about dating Morris Kornblum
ever again,

20:46.162 --> 20:47.914
because that lady is crazy town.

20:47.955 --> 20:51.291
Well, yeah, in my defense,
I was a teenager.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.418
She had a beach house.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.128
Oh, Harry.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.756
But Morris... he lived
in a teepee; you were 22.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.507
Yeah, yeah, let's go
see Annie's dress

20:58.549 --> 20:59.759
for tomorrow night.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.845
DEBBIE:
You are not gonna
win this one.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.263
Wow.

21:04.304 --> 21:05.765
Who is this
hot babe?

21:05.806 --> 21:06.974
You like it, Mom?

21:07.016 --> 21:08.267
It's beautiful.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.936
Look at her ass.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.687
You could crack
an egg on it.

21:11.729 --> 21:14.107
And I say that because,
when I was her age,

21:14.148 --> 21:17.026
Ricardo Montalban literally
cracked an egg on mine.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.028
I won't tell the rest
of the story

21:19.070 --> 21:20.446
because I don't remember it.

21:20.487 --> 21:21.614
Sweetie, don't
you think

21:21.655 --> 21:24.408
that this is just a
little less revealing?

21:24.450 --> 21:26.035
Oh, for God's sake,
who are you,

21:26.077 --> 21:27.912
Jedidiah
the Amish farmer?

21:27.954 --> 21:30.039
Why don't you go
churn us some butter.

21:30.081 --> 21:31.207
(chuckling)

21:31.249 --> 21:32.625
Beautiful.

21:32.666 --> 21:33.960
It looks really
beautiful.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.586
I like it.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.178
The thing is, Dixon
didn't start it; George did.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.180
He's just mad the guy's better,
but George is all like,

21:46.222 --> 21:47.807
"Oh, you have
to do this for me, man.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.433
"Just say he slashed me first
and jumped me

21:49.475 --> 21:51.185
and get him kicked off the team
instead of me."

21:51.227 --> 21:53.146
So, you have to lie for a
guy you don't even like?

21:53.187 --> 21:55.355
We're teammates.
It's different.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.732
Yes, if we weren't
on the same team,

21:56.774 --> 21:58.484
maybe I wouldn't hang out
with him, but we are.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.319
See, that's exactly
why I hate lacrosse, Ethan.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.238
You're not like those guys.
You're not into anything,

22:02.280 --> 22:03.656
so you don't understand.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.658
I'm not into anything?
What is that supposed to mean?

22:05.699 --> 22:07.868
Well, not like sports or music.
You shop.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.870
(laughs)
You think that's all I'm into?

22:09.912 --> 22:11.455
God, we're talking about me,

22:11.497 --> 22:13.415
and then, all of a sudden,
it's about you.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.627
Just forget it.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.045
I'm gonna go home.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.507
Ethan, wait.

22:21.548 --> 22:23.550
I'm coming with you.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.428
♪ ♪

22:54.207 --> 22:56.083
(mooing)

22:57.668 --> 22:59.670
Where's your cow?

22:59.712 --> 23:01.588
Where's your boyfriend
the cow?

23:01.630 --> 23:03.257
(boys laughing)

23:03.299 --> 23:05.176
Moo!

23:06.760 --> 23:08.888
What is that all about?

23:08.929 --> 23:11.265
Something you got to see.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.267
This is Silver's blog,
"The Vicious Circle."

23:13.309 --> 23:15.144
And what do you know,
half a million hits.

23:15.186 --> 23:16.603
I'm Navid, by the way.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.189
I produce the Blaze news.
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.357
Um, can you forward
to the part?

23:19.439 --> 23:20.774
Please.
Thanks.

23:20.816 --> 23:21.984
Way to block, dude.

23:22.026 --> 23:23.110
Thanks.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.654
Did you guys hear

23:25.696 --> 23:27.823
that Beverly Hills
just got invaded?

23:27.865 --> 23:28.991
Yeah, it did.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.326
So I got something
special for you.

23:30.368 --> 23:32.328
Something a little bit personal.

23:32.370 --> 23:33.662
Check it out.

23:33.704 --> 23:36.165
(banjo music playing)

23:36.207 --> 23:38.334
Beverly Hills sure is nice.

23:38.376 --> 23:40.211
Ain't it sweet,
ol' love of mine.

23:40.253 --> 23:43.047
(cow mooing)
I like being
a backstabbing bitch.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.464
(laughter)

23:44.506 --> 23:45.841
(school bell ringing)

23:45.883 --> 23:47.676
I can't believe
someone stole my purse.

23:47.718 --> 23:49.595
Hey, they stole
mine, too.

23:51.264 --> 23:52.598
Hey.
Saw the cow video.

23:52.639 --> 23:54.308
Funny stuff.

23:54.350 --> 23:56.185
Thanks.

23:56.227 --> 23:57.644
I just don't get what I did

23:57.686 --> 23:59.272
to make you so angry
that you had to go

23:59.313 --> 24:00.898
and do that.
Gee, I don't know.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.692
Maybe dissing me like
I was a piece of garbage

24:03.734 --> 24:05.403
to go sit with the
Bratz dolls.

24:05.443 --> 24:08.322
Okay, first of all,
I didn't diss you.

24:08.364 --> 24:09.782
Naomi pulled me away.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.200
If I hurt your feelings

24:11.242 --> 24:12.743
by sitting with someone
you don't like, then I'm sorry.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.079
It's not that I don't
like her. I hate her.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.497
Naomi is the Antichrist.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.666
Well, the Antichrist
didn't trash me

24:19.708 --> 24:21.252
in front of half
a million people.

24:21.294 --> 24:22.211
You did.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.342
So, how'd that go?

24:28.384 --> 24:30.844
She wasn't so into it.

24:30.886 --> 24:33.306
Can you blame her?

24:33.347 --> 24:35.182
Silver, how many times
have we had a talk

24:35.224 --> 24:37.017
about this blog
of yours?

24:37.059 --> 24:38.560
All it does is
cause problems.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.562
Yeah, well, that's
a blog's supposed to do.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.189
Cause problems.

24:42.231 --> 24:43.690
You know, you can't
make me stop.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.359
It's not like it's a
school activity or...

24:45.401 --> 24:47.027
Okay, I'm not
talking to you

24:47.069 --> 24:48.528
as the guidance counselor
right now.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.530
I am talking to you
as your sister.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.866
Okay, then as my sister

24:52.908 --> 24:55.035
you know what Naomi did
and why I hate her.

24:55.077 --> 24:57.288
Yes, but this didn't hurt Naomi.
It hurt Annie.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.539
Come on. You've got
to let go of that anger.

24:59.581 --> 25:00.958
It's not doing you any good.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.584
You don't want to end up
like Mom.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.128
Come on.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.130
Please.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.466
Just try, please.

25:08.506 --> 25:10.134
Okay.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.136
I'll try.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.762
So...

25:13.804 --> 25:15.513
how is Mom?
She's fine.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.599
You know, she's Mom.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.517
I gotta go.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.688
DIXON:
Ethan.

25:22.729 --> 25:24.357
Ethan, when you talk
to the coach today

25:24.398 --> 25:26.025
you're gonna tell him
the truth, right?

25:26.066 --> 25:28.068
You're gonna tell him that
George started it, right?

25:28.110 --> 25:29.611
Let's go, Ward. Now.

25:29.653 --> 25:31.447
Dude, I gotta go.

25:31.489 --> 25:32.530
GEORGE:
We gotta talk.

25:36.494 --> 25:37.703
And then Dixon

25:37.744 --> 25:39.372
slashed George and...

25:39.413 --> 25:40.914
George just reacted
like anyone would have.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.249
And you saw this?

25:42.291 --> 25:43.709
Yeah.

25:43.750 --> 25:46.170
You understand the consequences
if you're lying?

25:46.212 --> 25:48.297
Yes.

25:48.339 --> 25:49.423
Mr. Wilson,

25:49.465 --> 25:51.217
Ethan's never lied to me.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.426
You wouldn't do that,
right, Ethan?

25:52.468 --> 25:54.011
You wouldn't look me
in the eye

25:54.053 --> 25:55.304
and lie to my face, would you?

25:56.472 --> 25:58.640
No.

25:58.682 --> 26:00.558
All right, well, because
of what you just said,

26:00.600 --> 26:02.520
I have no choice
but to keep Dixon

26:02.560 --> 26:03.812
from joining the team.
We can't have players

26:03.854 --> 26:04.855
who start fights.

26:04.897 --> 26:05.647
You can go, Ethan.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.405
That kid is lying.

26:12.446 --> 26:15.282
Well, maybe, maybe not.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.326
Were you there?
I was and I didn't see it.

26:17.368 --> 26:18.327
I know my son.

26:18.369 --> 26:20.746
Harry, how many times
you hear that from parents?

26:23.123 --> 26:24.375
And what if

26:24.417 --> 26:26.043
Dad can't get me back
on the team?

26:27.211 --> 26:29.171
I-I mean, I can't tell
him this,

26:29.213 --> 26:32.590
but he's, like, the whole
reason why I play.

26:32.632 --> 26:34.592
Like, he played lacrosse

26:34.634 --> 26:38.222
so, you know, I thought
if I played...

26:38.264 --> 26:40.057
What?

26:40.099 --> 26:41.892
When I'm on the field,

26:41.934 --> 26:43.894
when he talks to me
after a game,

26:43.936 --> 26:46.146
it's like something we have
together.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.316
That's like our thing.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.529
Like we're really
father and son.

26:53.571 --> 26:56.031
You are really
father and son.

26:56.073 --> 26:57.074
Don't even say that.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.117
It's been eight years,

26:58.158 --> 26:59.118
Dixon.

27:00.494 --> 27:01.619
You're us.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.372
I...

27:03.414 --> 27:04.790
I just really
want to play.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.295
How could you do that

27:09.336 --> 27:11.213
to my brother?
How could you lie like that?

27:11.255 --> 27:13.382
It's-it's not that simple.
It is!

27:13.424 --> 27:16.051
My God, you... you lie.

27:16.093 --> 27:17.303
You cheat on your girlfriend.

27:17.344 --> 27:19.721
A girl who,
by the way, I like.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.723
Do you remember what
I told you I liked about you

27:21.765 --> 27:24.726
the first time
we met?

27:24.768 --> 27:27.229
That I was frighteningly honest.

27:27.271 --> 27:28.897
Yeah, I guess

27:28.939 --> 27:31.191
I'm just wondering
what the hell happened

27:31.233 --> 27:33.902
to that guy that I liked
from a couple summers ago.

27:33.944 --> 27:35.821
Because this new one
is an ass.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.075
(school bell ringing)

27:40.117 --> 27:42.077
"But more than a historical
snapshot of divisions

27:42.119 --> 27:44.079
"between classes,
A Tale of Two Cities makes us

27:44.121 --> 27:45.705
"examine the morality
in our own lives

27:45.747 --> 27:47.333
and the true meaning
of sacrifice."

27:47.374 --> 27:48.834
(applause)

27:48.875 --> 27:50.252
Thank you, Naomi.

27:50.294 --> 27:51.920
That was...

27:51.962 --> 27:54.089
that was very well written.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.592
I can't believe you copied
the whole thing word for word.

27:56.634 --> 27:58.469
What did you think
I was going to do?

27:58.511 --> 27:59.637
Not that.

27:59.677 --> 28:01.347
Maybe take some ideas,

28:01.388 --> 28:02.764
at least change it
around a little.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.724
What do you care?
It was an old paper, right?

28:04.766 --> 28:06.726
You should have
asked me first.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.146
I would have helped you
if you needed it.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.230
That's what
friends do.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.649
You did help me, Annie.
You did.

28:11.731 --> 28:13.317
I don't know why
you're so hung up

28:13.359 --> 28:14.734
on this.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.778
Here.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.238
It's the dress you loved
from Maxfield.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.115
I bought it for you,
anyway, because

28:20.157 --> 28:22.493
that's what friends do.

NAOMI:
I'm so excited for
the party tonight.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.852
Everyone has
RSVP'd already.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.522
Um, Cory Kennedy
is coming.

28:51.564 --> 28:54.316
And Tillie and the Wall
are performing.

28:54.358 --> 28:56.360
I'm so excited.

29:15.462 --> 29:17.506
Let's do the reprise
to "Mama."

29:17.548 --> 29:18.757
You know,

29:18.798 --> 29:20.050
it's feeling a little thin,
guys.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.260
We need to thicken it up.

29:21.301 --> 29:23.095
The vocals need
to be strong,

29:23.136 --> 29:24.597
okay?
Hey, Miss Austin.

29:24.638 --> 29:25.431
Why don't you add Annie?

29:25.472 --> 29:26.432
She's been watching
the rehearsal.

29:26.473 --> 29:27.600
I'm sure she knows

29:27.641 --> 29:29.768
all the words.
Well, I think it's
a little bit late.

29:29.809 --> 29:30.810
I-I really do.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.563
I really do, Miss Austin.

29:32.605 --> 29:33.606
I've listened to the CD
like a billion times

29:33.647 --> 29:34.648
and I've been
watching

29:34.690 --> 29:35.733
all the steps, so,

29:35.774 --> 29:37.150
I think I could
really do this.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.027
Um, okay, uh,

29:39.069 --> 29:40.904
let's see what you can do.
Grab a mic.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.615
Take the center
spot on stage.

29:44.824 --> 29:46.952
Okay, let's take
it from the top.

29:46.993 --> 29:49.455

30:23.947 --> 30:25.240
Annie.

30:25.282 --> 30:26.659
How would you like
to put down the paintbrush

30:26.700 --> 30:27.534
and join the chorus?

30:27.576 --> 30:28.827
I would so love to.

30:28.868 --> 30:30.496
Thank you!
Thank you so much.
It was great.

30:30.537 --> 30:31.497
(chuckles)

30:31.538 --> 30:32.872
You're welcome.
See you tomorrow.

30:33.873 --> 30:35.041
Dad, I just got to perform.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.209
Did you see that?
It was...

30:36.251 --> 30:38.044
so much fun!

30:38.086 --> 30:40.005
We need to talk.

30:40.046 --> 30:41.923
Why did Naomi Clark
turn in your paper?

30:56.355 --> 30:58.482
Naomi, I'll deal with you
after I make a call.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.484
Annie, you wait
for me here

31:00.526 --> 31:02.402
till the end
of the day.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.865
I cannot believe you told
your dad everything.

31:06.906 --> 31:08.492
Are you kidding me?
He recognized the paper.

31:08.534 --> 31:09.660
And Mr. Matthews
could tell, too.

31:09.702 --> 31:10.828
What was I supposed to do?

31:10.869 --> 31:12.120
Cry. Threaten him.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.163
Be creative.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.748
You sound like a spoiled brat.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.166
Well, you sound like
a little bitch.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.460
And just so we're clear,
you're completely

31:18.502 --> 31:19.961
disinvited to my birthday party.

31:20.003 --> 31:20.838
'Cause I care.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.339
Oh, you should.

31:25.759 --> 31:26.802
Did you see
if Wilson was crying?

31:26.844 --> 31:28.178
Dude, shut up.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.638
Dude, don't be
such a puss.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.056
Who cares
about that puss?

31:35.394 --> 31:37.145
You want to fight?

31:37.187 --> 31:38.814
She wants to keep the cheating
off her record,

31:38.856 --> 31:41.191
she writes me a new paper on a
new book by the end of the day.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.442
Well, that's
impossible.

31:42.484 --> 31:43.569
She can't.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.237
Well, then that kills
any chance she has

31:45.278 --> 31:46.655
of joining her sister at Yale.

31:46.697 --> 31:47.740
She's not going to Yale.

31:47.781 --> 31:49.575
What does that mean?

31:49.616 --> 31:51.993
Just that you have
other interests.

31:52.035 --> 31:53.537
I'm just as smart as Jen, Mom.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.706
Honey, all I meant is that
you have your big party tonight.

31:55.748 --> 31:56.998
You have to have

31:57.040 --> 31:58.041
your final fitting.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.000
Sweetie, you've
been emotional.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.753
You've had your purse stolen...

32:00.794 --> 32:03.088
Can you stop making excuses
for her?

32:03.129 --> 32:04.214
Naomi, do you hear this?

32:04.256 --> 32:06.007
Mr. Matthews
doesn't think

32:06.049 --> 32:07.843
you can do it; your mother
doesn't think you can do it.

32:07.885 --> 32:09.344
Oh, don't talk to my daughter
like that.

32:09.386 --> 32:12.180
I am trying to get her to take
responsibility for her life.

32:12.222 --> 32:13.473
Oh, you're one to talk.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.810
This is about Naomi.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.854
And you're being lazy.

32:18.896 --> 32:20.856
I think you're smart.

32:20.898 --> 32:22.148
I think you
can do it.

32:22.190 --> 32:23.692
Come on, Naomi. Prove 'em wrong.

32:23.734 --> 32:25.778
Unless, of course, I'm way
off base, and you cheated

32:25.819 --> 32:27.279
because you aren't
smart enough

32:27.320 --> 32:28.405
and you do need another week.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.907
Honey, take
another week.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.784
I don't need another week!

32:31.825 --> 32:33.577
I didn't cheat because
I couldn't write the paper.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.537
I'll write the stupid paper
right now, Mom.

32:35.579 --> 32:36.580
I'll show you...

32:36.622 --> 32:38.123
Naomi, you...
Mom,

32:38.164 --> 32:39.958
could you just...

32:39.999 --> 32:41.418
could you just leave?

32:59.937 --> 33:02.981
So, look,
I'm not great at apologies,

33:03.022 --> 33:06.902
but I shouldn't have posted
that cow video,

33:06.944 --> 33:09.404
and I was hoping that by
helping you get in the play,

33:09.446 --> 33:12.073
I don't know,
maybe that makes us cool.

33:12.115 --> 33:13.575
Maybe friends.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.953
Yeah, that'd be great.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.996
(both chuckle)

33:19.456 --> 33:21.750
Ethan, what
happened to you?

33:21.792 --> 33:23.335
Tell your brother
he's back on the team.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.171
(car starts)

33:28.298 --> 33:31.259
Dixon, Dixon.

33:31.301 --> 33:32.511
You're back on the team.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.179
What?
Yeah, I know,
I wanted

33:34.220 --> 33:35.597
to see your face
when I told you.

33:35.639 --> 33:38.600
I spoke to Ethan and I guess
he told the coach the truth.

33:38.642 --> 33:39.810
Oh, man.

33:39.852 --> 33:41.520
Ethan is going to kill me
when he finds out

33:41.561 --> 33:42.813
what I did
to get even with him.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.773
(groaning):
What did you do?

33:44.815 --> 33:47.818
I, uh, sent the text to Naomi

33:47.860 --> 33:50.278
saying that Ethan
was cheating on her.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.322
What?! Why?
Why would you do that?

33:52.364 --> 33:54.199
Look, I'm sorry, all right,
but I just reacted.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.617
I was angry.
I'm the only one

33:55.659 --> 33:56.869
who saw him with that girl.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.119
He's going to think that I...

33:58.161 --> 33:59.371
What am I
going to do?

34:00.831 --> 34:02.708
What am I
going to do?

34:08.505 --> 34:10.340
DEBBIE:
Do you think
it's fair that we

34:10.382 --> 34:13.134
let Dixon go to the party
after he gets into a fight

34:13.176 --> 34:14.427
but we ground Annie?

34:14.469 --> 34:16.346
Wha-What, we should just let
her not have any punishment?

34:16.388 --> 34:17.806
No, but it could have
started tomorrow.

34:17.848 --> 34:19.098
Back home, yeah,
but here,

34:19.139 --> 34:20.976
I just feel like there's
so much more temptation

34:21.018 --> 34:21.976
and ways to get
into trouble.

34:22.018 --> 34:25.188
I feel like we need
to be tougher.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.188
I guess I feel
like sometimes

34:26.231 --> 34:27.607
we bend over
backwards for Dixon,

34:27.649 --> 34:30.360
but we don't do
the same for Annie.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.070
(knocking)

34:32.110 --> 34:34.781
Annie.

34:34.822 --> 34:36.949
Sweetheart?

34:36.992 --> 34:38.159
Your mom and I
have talked

34:38.201 --> 34:40.746
and we've decided
you can go to the party.

34:40.786 --> 34:42.831
Annie?

34:42.873 --> 34:45.042
That's weird.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.043
Mom, have you seen Annie?

34:47.085 --> 34:48.085
Yes,

34:48.127 --> 34:52.674
just before she left,
and she looked smoking.

34:52.716 --> 34:55.677
(rhythmic clapping)

46:47.054 --> 46:49.181
Hi.

46:49.223 --> 46:51.850
Hi.

46:51.892 --> 46:54.562
Here, I, uh,

46:54.604 --> 46:56.897
got this.
It didn't travel well,

46:56.939 --> 46:59.442
but it made me
think of you, so...

46:59.484 --> 47:03.028
Because it's crushed?

47:03.070 --> 47:04.405
Are we gonna be okay?

47:07.824 --> 47:09.619
I hope so.

47:13.581 --> 47:15.333
I'll meet you after class.

47:21.673 --> 47:25.050
Why don't you watch where
you're going, Ward?

47:25.092 --> 47:26.302
You need a hug, dude?

47:26.344 --> 47:27.720
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

47:27.762 --> 47:29.597
Everything's gonna be okay.

47:31.432 --> 47:33.476
Hey, Annie.

47:35.645 --> 47:37.938
Hey.
Hey, uh, listen,
I just want to say

47:37.980 --> 47:40.483
I'm sorry for all the stuff
I put you through last week.

47:40.525 --> 47:41.442
It's okay.

47:41.484 --> 47:42.401
Well, no, it's not,

47:42.443 --> 47:46.405
but anyway, um, how are you?

47:46.447 --> 47:48.324
Um, Jason broke up with me.

47:48.366 --> 47:50.242
My boyfriend
from back home?

47:50.284 --> 47:51.910
Wow, that sucks.

47:51.952 --> 47:53.579
Yeah.
Um,

47:53.621 --> 47:55.456
Do you want me to, like,
kick his ass?

47:55.498 --> 47:57.082
'Cause I could totally do that
for you.

47:57.124 --> 47:59.669
He'd kill you, but, uh, thanks
for the thought.

48:03.922 --> 48:05.383
Wait. He'd kill me?

48:06.843 --> 48:08.761

48:24.151 --> 48:25.361
Was I that bad?

48:25.403 --> 48:28.030
Oh, my God, no-no-no.
Uh, not...

48:28.072 --> 48:29.198
It was great.

48:29.240 --> 48:32.451
You just...
You have a really nice voice.

48:32.493 --> 48:35.371
Uh, I-I'm Annie.

48:35.413 --> 48:36.873
I'm in the musical, too.

48:36.913 --> 48:37.998
But I'm just in the chorus.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.166
You probably never noticed me

48:39.208 --> 48:41.627
'cause why would you look
behind you?

48:41.669 --> 48:43.379
I've noticed you, Annie.

48:43.421 --> 48:45.297
Oh.

48:45.339 --> 48:49.009
Oh, you dropped this.

48:49.051 --> 48:51.136
Thank you.

48:51.178 --> 48:52.722
I'm just, I'm in rehearsal.

48:52.764 --> 48:55.140
Please go do your thing.

48:55.182 --> 48:57.393
Thanks. We'll just start
from the top, I guess.

49:00.396 --> 49:02.022
All right, let's start

49:02.064 --> 49:03.023
with last night's reading.

49:03.065 --> 49:05.234
Uh, who wants to tell me
what a haiku is?

49:05.276 --> 49:08.070
And if you say a haiku
is the new sushi roll at Koi,

49:08.112 --> 49:10.573
well, that would be incorrect.

49:10.615 --> 49:13.868

49:28.549 --> 49:30.175
Adriana, what's up with you?
Are you okay?

49:30.217 --> 49:32.344
Yeah. I'm just distracted.

49:32.386 --> 49:33.679
I have this
really big audition

49:33.721 --> 49:34.513
for this movie this week

49:34.555 --> 49:35.932
and I just haven't

49:35.972 --> 49:37.266
been able to sleep.

49:37.308 --> 49:39.268
And if you get it, what then?

49:39.310 --> 49:44.106
Well, then I'd be in a movie,
make lots of money.

49:44.148 --> 49:46.066
So, what, you can buy
a new cell phone

49:46.108 --> 49:47.693
or maybe a fancy pair of shoes?

49:47.735 --> 49:49.194
Maybe an expensive car
you really don't need?

49:49.236 --> 49:50.613
No,

49:50.655 --> 49:54.158
so I can pay the mortgage
'cause my mom can't.

50:00.915 --> 50:03.334
Well, did you
enjoy my party?

50:03.375 --> 50:05.419
I know we shouldn't have
crashed, but...

50:05.461 --> 50:07.713
Oh! Cool tattoo.

50:07.755 --> 50:09.924
Yeah. No, I don't blame you.

50:09.966 --> 50:11.759
I mean, it was
a fabulous party.

50:11.801 --> 50:14.219
I just didn't expect
to see you there, you know,

50:14.261 --> 50:16.054
with all your morals
and everything.

50:16.096 --> 50:17.473
Thank you.

50:17.515 --> 50:19.224
(huffs)

50:19.266 --> 50:21.727
Ms. Taylor?

50:21.769 --> 50:23.270
Mr. Matthews.

50:23.312 --> 50:24.897
You know,
if you sit with me,

50:24.939 --> 50:26.816
I'll let you have
half my sandwich.

50:26.858 --> 50:29.610
How about I sit with you
and you keep your sandwich?

50:29.652 --> 50:30.862
Well, you're too easy.

50:30.903 --> 50:32.154
Anyone ever tell you that?

50:32.196 --> 50:33.823
Not lately.

50:33.865 --> 50:36.116
(whispering)

50:40.120 --> 50:43.791
So, guys, uh...

50:43.833 --> 50:45.793
are we gonna get 'em back
or what?

50:45.835 --> 50:47.419
Uh, no, man.
I mean, you heard

50:47.461 --> 50:48.587
what Mr. Wilson said.

50:48.629 --> 50:50.172
I mean, uh, your dad.

50:50.214 --> 50:52.257
No retaliation,
right?

50:52.299 --> 50:55.177
Come on, guys.
I want in on this.

50:55.219 --> 50:56.428
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

50:56.470 --> 50:58.848
Dude, you're
the principal's kid.

50:58.890 --> 51:00.474
I mean,
what are we,

51:00.516 --> 51:01.934
stupid?

51:04.979 --> 51:07.272
I think this may be
my best blogisode yet.

51:07.314 --> 51:08.983
Now, why does that scare me?

51:09.025 --> 51:11.443
You shouldn't be scared.
Others should be scared.

51:11.485 --> 51:13.362
Okay, seriously, Silver,
it's kinda mean,

51:13.404 --> 51:15.781
and it makes me feel
like I can't tell you stuff.

51:15.823 --> 51:17.867
In fact, I probably
already told you too much.

51:21.537 --> 51:22.788
Okay, what was that?

51:22.830 --> 51:24.498
What?
"What?"

51:24.540 --> 51:26.834
Mm, Ty Collins just practically
put his tongue in your mouth.

51:26.876 --> 51:27.835
That's what.

51:27.877 --> 51:29.003
Shut up!

51:29.045 --> 51:30.546
Okay, you are obviously
too messed up

51:30.588 --> 51:32.297
to see what's right
in front of you,

51:32.339 --> 51:33.716
so let me be your eyes.

51:33.758 --> 51:35.384
Ty Collins
is into you?

51:35.426 --> 51:38.262
You should be into Ty Collins.

51:38.303 --> 51:39.346
Or so to speak.

51:39.388 --> 51:41.306
Okay, can you just give me
one second

51:41.348 --> 51:43.684
because my old relationship
ended six hours ago?

51:43.726 --> 51:45.477
Okay, the cure for a breakup
is a hookup.

51:45.519 --> 51:46.645
Now, he does
tend to leave

51:46.687 --> 51:48.814
brokenhearted girls
sobbing at his locker,

51:48.856 --> 51:52.359
but for a temporary distraction,
he's your man.

51:52.401 --> 51:54.278
That is a terrible
recommendation.

51:54.319 --> 51:57.656
And I really don't think
he's that into me.

51:57.698 --> 51:59.825
(scoffs):
Yeah...

51:59.867 --> 52:00.868
'cause you're such a dork.

52:00.910 --> 52:02.870
Thanks.

52:08.876 --> 52:09.919
Hey, Annie.

52:09.961 --> 52:11.670
Hey. Hey, Ty.

52:11.712 --> 52:13.213
Want to grab dinner tonight
after rehearsal?

52:13.255 --> 52:16.550
Um... uh, yeah.

52:16.592 --> 52:17.802
Great.

52:21.388 --> 52:24.308
I'm so sorry
that happened to you.

52:24.349 --> 52:26.184
I don't know why people cheat.

52:26.226 --> 52:27.061
Who are you

52:27.103 --> 52:29.021
and why are you speaking to me?

52:29.063 --> 52:34.192
(Silver's voice):
Welcome to my first installment
of Puppet Revenge Theater.

52:34.234 --> 52:38.572

"We're Fighting... Again"

52:38.614 --> 52:40.198
How could you
cheat on me?!

52:40.240 --> 52:41.909
I think I'm
so beautiful.

52:41.951 --> 52:43.953
I love lacrosse.

52:43.995 --> 52:45.537
No! No, no, you're supposed
to love me!

52:45.579 --> 52:46.538
'Cause you're
the only one

52:46.580 --> 52:47.957
stupid enough
to actually think

52:47.999 --> 52:49.625
that I'm interesting.

52:49.667 --> 52:50.918
I love lacrosse.

52:50.960 --> 52:51.919

52:51.961 --> 52:53.712

to be legendary.

Too bad that's not
on Silver's site.

53:28.873 --> 53:30.749
Maybe you can
reenact it.

53:30.791 --> 53:31.917
Ooh.

53:31.959 --> 53:34.545
The harder the slap,
the faster they run back.

53:34.586 --> 53:36.130
You should so write
a relationship blog.

NAOMI:
Mm-hmm. Wait till you see
the second part of my plan.

53:43.261 --> 53:45.430
Why do you want to do anything
with those jock asses anyway?

53:45.472 --> 53:47.391
They're just gonna end up
selling tires or car insurance.

53:47.432 --> 53:49.225
Oh! Killed ya!

53:49.267 --> 53:50.394
Buh-bye.

53:50.435 --> 53:52.354
Look, the fun part
about being on a team

53:52.396 --> 53:53.981
is being part of the team,

53:54.023 --> 53:57.109
and you wouldn't know that
because you were never on one.

53:57.151 --> 53:58.402
How do you keep doing that?!

53:58.443 --> 53:59.737
Because you are my bitch.

53:59.778 --> 54:01.864
I was on a team
in the sixth grade.

54:01.906 --> 54:03.532
I played soccer
with all those guys.

54:03.574 --> 54:05.241
But I kept scoring
for the other team,

54:05.283 --> 54:06.284
so we respectfully
parted ways.

54:07.870 --> 54:08.829
I hit you first!

54:08.871 --> 54:10.956
Then why are
you dead?

54:10.998 --> 54:14.250
Look, I just got to come up
with the dopest prank ever, kid.

54:14.292 --> 54:16.420
Like, just crazy.

54:16.461 --> 54:19.090
So they won't even think of me
as the principal's kid anymore.

54:19.131 --> 54:20.424
Suck on that!
Suck on that!

54:20.465 --> 54:22.467
Sweet, dude, you ate my head.

54:22.509 --> 54:23.928
(chuckles)

54:23.969 --> 54:25.137
So what are you going to do?

54:25.179 --> 54:26.680
I don't know.

54:26.722 --> 54:28.224
You got anything?

Honey, I'm swamped at
work. Is this important?

54:35.147 --> 54:38.525
ANNIE:
I'm just going to go grab a bite
with a friend from the play.

54:38.567 --> 54:40.819
Is that okay?
What bite, what friend?

54:40.861 --> 54:42.947
Just this guy, who...

54:42.988 --> 54:44.949
Is this a date?
That was fast.

54:44.990 --> 54:46.324
It's not a date, Mom.

54:46.366 --> 54:47.785
It's just a hang.

54:47.826 --> 54:49.369
A hang?
On a school night?

54:49.411 --> 54:51.622
I know it's a school night,

54:51.663 --> 54:53.331
but it's just a guy
from the play.

54:53.373 --> 54:54.666
His name is Ty,

54:54.708 --> 54:56.460
and we just want to, you know,
talk about the play...

54:56.501 --> 54:58.670
Nothing special,
we just want to hang...

54:58.712 --> 55:00.131
Okay, slow down.

55:00.172 --> 55:01.590
It'd be nice to have something

55:01.632 --> 55:03.592
to take my mind off Jason,
you know.

55:03.634 --> 55:05.719
And I promise
I won't be out late.

55:05.761 --> 55:07.179
I didn't say yes yet.

55:07.221 --> 55:09.305
Come on, Mom, please.

55:09.347 --> 55:11.725
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

55:11.767 --> 55:13.644
I'm going to be working
later than I thought,

55:13.685 --> 55:16.021
so can you and Ty stop by,
pick up Grandma's computer

55:16.063 --> 55:17.982
and drop it off to her
before your hang?

55:18.023 --> 55:18.983
Will do.

55:19.024 --> 55:21.277
Be home by 10:00.
I love you.

55:21.317 --> 55:23.237
I will see you at 9:59.

55:23.279 --> 55:26.282
All right,
here we go.

55:26.322 --> 55:30.452
Bullitt Central High School
in Shepherdsville, Kentucky,

55:30.494 --> 55:32.746
put Nair in
the other team's

55:32.788 --> 55:36.000
jockstraps.
Do you really want to touch
the other team's jockstraps?

55:36.041 --> 55:37.668
Good point.

55:37.709 --> 55:40.378
Hello, gentlemen.

55:40.420 --> 55:41.797
Hey Grandma, what's up?

55:41.839 --> 55:44.382
Oh, just waiting for Annie
to bring my computer back.

55:44.424 --> 55:46.342
I heard about the trash
at school.

55:46.384 --> 55:48.137
Yeah.

55:48.179 --> 55:50.430
You know, your dad

55:50.472 --> 55:51.682
loved a good prank.

55:51.723 --> 55:53.642
His senior year,
he and the team

55:53.684 --> 55:56.520
got 50 pigs, God only
knows from where--

55:56.561 --> 55:58.022
and released them on
Palisade's field.

55:58.063 --> 55:59.564
Took them
six hours

55:59.606 --> 56:01.733
to catch them all

56:01.775 --> 56:03.735
and then they had to play
the game in pig poop.

56:03.777 --> 56:05.029
(chuckles)

56:05.070 --> 56:08.157
I'll let you get back
to your studies.

56:09.491 --> 56:13.078
I think I have
an idea.

56:20.585 --> 56:22.378
So where are we?

56:22.420 --> 56:24.215
This looks like an airport.

56:24.256 --> 56:25.423
TY:
It is.

56:25.465 --> 56:27.051
ANNIE:
The planes seem small.

56:27.092 --> 56:31.263
TY:
Private planes,
private airport.

56:31.305 --> 56:33.891

the restaurant.

56:33.932 --> 56:35.017

56:37.686 --> 56:38.812
Ooh.

56:44.068 --> 56:45.986
He has a jet, Silver. A jet.

56:46.028 --> 56:47.654
Okay, it's the
coolest thing ever.

56:47.696 --> 56:49.531
It's like Pretty Woman,
but I'm not a whore.

56:49.573 --> 56:52.368
Yeah, well, he is
the richest guy in school.

56:52.408 --> 56:54.912
And I have a solid
say-yes-to-jet policy,

56:54.953 --> 56:56.288

56:56.330 --> 57:00.792

would kill me,

57:00.834 --> 57:02.961

didn't let me go

57:03.003 --> 57:04.796

at Astro Burger.

57:04.838 --> 57:06.757
Well, okay, it's,
like, an hour flight, right?

57:06.798 --> 57:09.134
It's like being stuck
on Sunset in traffic.

57:09.176 --> 57:11.303

I should...?

57:11.345 --> 57:13.389

and go.

57:13.429 --> 57:14.723

57:19.937 --> 57:22.022
Hey, Naomi,
I'm so sorry

57:22.064 --> 57:23.899
to hear about Ethan
rejecting you.

57:23.941 --> 57:25.650
You are such a good person.

57:25.692 --> 57:27.111
You really deserve
to be happy.

57:27.152 --> 57:28.486
He didn't reject her,
Bitch Lips.

57:28.528 --> 57:29.821
She slapped him.

57:29.863 --> 57:32.324
Yeah, his cheating was
really an act of love.

57:32.366 --> 57:33.658

Just so you know,
I'm going to try
and play it cool,

57:43.085 --> 57:44.962
but I am totally
freaking out right now.

57:45.003 --> 57:46.713
I'm freaking out, too.

57:46.755 --> 57:49.258
I just talked to the pilot
and he's slurring his words.

57:49.300 --> 57:50.259
Are you serious?

57:50.301 --> 57:51.802
(chuckles):
No, I'm not.

freak out about a plane...

57:57.433 --> 57:58.892
it's cute.

57:58.934 --> 58:00.518

like a good thing.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.396
It's a great thing.

58:08.902 --> 58:11.405
Yes, I hated
the business side

58:11.447 --> 58:14.199
of the fashion world
and I had my degree
in psychology,

58:14.241 --> 58:16.076
so I thought, why not?

58:16.118 --> 58:19.037
I went back and got
my Masters and here I am.

58:19.079 --> 58:20.289
How about you?

58:20.331 --> 58:21.873
How did you get
started in teaching?

58:21.915 --> 58:24.084
For the chicks.

58:24.126 --> 58:26.253
Listen, I wanted
to ask you something

58:26.295 --> 58:28.797
outside of school.

58:28.839 --> 58:31.425
Will you go to dinner
with me sometime?

58:31.467 --> 58:33.427
I don't know.

58:33.469 --> 58:35.095
Yikes. Is that like a,
I'm-just-not-that-into-you,

58:35.137 --> 58:37.139
"I don't know,"
or is it more of a

58:39.308 --> 58:41.268

a babysitter.

01:05:04.568 --> 01:05:07.195
(laughs)
And anything else you
put in front of him.

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:08.279
(laughter)

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:09.322
(knocking)

01:05:09.364 --> 01:05:10.490
Tabitha, someone's here

01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:12.033
to check on you.

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:14.369
Grandma... are you okay?

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:15.453
Oh, sweetie, I'm fine.

01:05:15.495 --> 01:05:16.454
Did you hear?

01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:17.997
I nailed an SUV.

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:19.957
The big bastard
was taking up three spots.

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:22.168
(laughs):
Hi, Mrs. Brewer.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:24.629
(laughs):
Hi, Annie.
It's so good to see you.

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:26.798
I believe you
know my grandson.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.675
Hey.

01:05:28.717 --> 01:05:30.093
Hi.

01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:40.437
So...

01:05:40.478 --> 01:05:42.980
you like him?

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:45.525
Yeah. Yeah, I like him.

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:47.193
We had fun.

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:49.987
A-At the very least,
we'll be friends.

01:05:51.698 --> 01:05:52.824
Just friends, or...?

01:05:52.866 --> 01:05:55.076
Well, that's the most
important thing.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:57.370
If we can't be that, then
we can't be anything else.

01:05:57.412 --> 01:05:59.247
right?
Right.

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:02.626
♪ Nothing's gonna stop me
but divine intervention... ♪

01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:05.295
Are we friends?
(laughs softly)

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:11.843
Hey, remember that
Fourth of July at the pier?

01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:13.094
That was fun.

01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:14.095
Oh yeah! Yeah!

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:15.680
I'm still mad at you
about that,

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:17.014
by the way--
you were supposed

01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:18.558
to send me those pictures
of the octopus...

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.518
Oh, the penta-pus-- it
only had five tentacles.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.019
Yes, yes, the penta-pus.
Yes.

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:24.648
Of course, the penta-pus
that I won, yeah.
That I won.

01:06:24.689 --> 01:06:26.524
E-Excuse me--
who was the one

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:28.485
who threw the ball
that knocked over

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:31.195
the last milk bottle?
Aw, it was wobbling already.

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:32.656
It was already
falling down.

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:34.115
You just grabbed
the ball and threw it

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:35.408
as it was going down--
that doesn't...

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:37.702
And knocked it over--
which is why I won

01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:39.704
the penta-pus,
thank you very much.

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:42.206
God, that was
the ugliest thing
I've ever seen.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:43.792
(laughs)
It was.

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:46.294
I-I bet you it was stuffed
with asbestos or something.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.713
I got a rash for a week
after holding that thing.

01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:50.632
It was not good.
Not good.

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:52.175
Whatever happened
to that thing?

01:06:52.216 --> 01:06:53.593
I don't know.

01:06:53.635 --> 01:06:56.220
Probably just... dissolved.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:01.017
So...

01:07:01.058 --> 01:07:03.561
how are things
with you and Naomi?

01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:05.897
Not good.

01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:08.358
I'm sorry.

01:07:08.399 --> 01:07:10.276
Yeah, I am, too.

01:07:10.318 --> 01:07:12.153
About a lot of things.

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:17.158
VIRGINIA:
Ethan, time to go.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.244
Well, that's my exit.

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:23.373
(exhales):
Your grandmother has trouble
driving, too, huh?

01:07:23.414 --> 01:07:25.876
God, it must suck getting old.

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:27.293
Yeah, actually, uh...

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:29.086
she drives just fine.

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:33.550
See you around, Annie.

01:07:46.103 --> 01:07:48.481
HARRY:
So, nobody knows anything
about the four pigs

01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:51.609
that destroyed Palisades Hall's
cafeteria last night?

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:55.947
Really.

01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:57.574
Interesting.

01:07:57.615 --> 01:07:59.242
Besides extensive
property damage,

01:07:59.283 --> 01:08:01.452
they had to call
animal control,
who's been looking

01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:04.163
for the pigs, trying to round
them up for the last ten hours,

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:06.123
and just can't seem
to find them all.

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:07.542
(quiet laughing)

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:09.126
You know, a lot
of schools hate Palisades.

01:08:09.168 --> 01:08:10.253
It could've been any of them..

01:08:10.294 --> 01:08:11.462
No. These pigs
were wearing

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.006
West Beverly
lacrosse jerseys.

01:08:13.048 --> 01:08:14.966
Yeah, it's probably us.

01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:16.843
Was I not clear
when I said

01:08:16.885 --> 01:08:18.094
no retaliation?

01:08:18.135 --> 01:08:19.804
Let me be clear
about this--

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:21.639
if one of you
doesn't step forward

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.682
by 1:00 today

01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:24.140
and take responsibility
for this,

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:26.728
your lacrosse season... is over.

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.688
Aw, come on!
What?!

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.481
That's not fair.
You can't do that.

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:33.568
It's funny guys,
but someone's got to come clean.

01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:40.241
Still running lines?

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.243
Yeah, I'm almost off script.

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:43.453
You ready for
your audition?

01:08:43.493 --> 01:08:44.787
My mom thinks I am.

01:08:44.828 --> 01:08:45.872
What about you?

01:08:45.913 --> 01:08:48.041
Yeah. That's what I meant.

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:50.292
I'm ready. I'm on it.

01:08:50.334 --> 01:08:52.377
You know, it's all
over school,

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.880
about you and George.

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:56.256
(laughs):
I know.

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:57.634
Has Ethan called?

01:08:57.675 --> 01:08:58.969
Meeting tonight.

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:01.136
Told you it would work.
Good luck.

01:09:01.178 --> 01:09:02.889
You, too.

01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:05.683
(bell rings)

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:09.020
I need you to tell me
if you know anything.
How can you

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:11.731
ask me that?
It'll be much better
if somebody steps forward.

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:14.109
So you're asking me
to rat on my team?

01:09:14.191 --> 01:09:16.402
They barely trust me as it is.

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:18.738
You don't think that they
know I'm in here right now,

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:20.281
thinking I'm giving them up?

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.033
Is there something to give up?

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:24.868
Are you asking me this
as my dad or as my principal?

01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:26.787
Because my dad
would be on my side.

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:28.038
Your father and your principal

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:30.041
are trying to teach you
something about character.

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:31.709
By ratting on my team.
No.

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:34.252
By taking responsibility
for your actions.

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:36.756
Whoever is involved with this
has to come forward,

01:09:36.798 --> 01:09:39.134
or the entire team
gets punished.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:40.844
Fine! It was me.

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:42.053
What was?

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:43.261
I did it.

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:45.765
Did what?
I-I-I...

01:09:45.807 --> 01:09:47.642
let the pigs loose,
I-I planned everything,

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:48.977
I did everything by myself.

01:09:49.019 --> 01:09:50.560
(laughs)

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:52.229
Come on, Dixon.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:53.898
What? You don't
believe me?

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:55.817
No. No, I don't believe you.

01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:57.694
Where do you think
I got the idea from?

01:09:57.735 --> 01:10:00.196
Grandma told me about your pig
prank when you were on the team.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:03.992
(groans)

01:10:07.745 --> 01:10:09.288
(exhales)

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:12.542
Okay.

01:10:12.583 --> 01:10:15.670
Are you absolutely
certain that...

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:19.049
you want to take
full responsibility for this?

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:21.467
All on your head?

01:10:21.509 --> 01:10:24.595
All of it, by yourself?

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:28.099
Easiest decision I've made
since I got here.

01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:30.185
Okay.

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:34.022
Skyler.

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:46.826
(coughs)

01:10:46.868 --> 01:10:47.994
Adrianna?

01:10:48.036 --> 01:10:49.746
I think she left.

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:50.872
Okay.

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:54.291
SILVER:
So, come on, spill it.

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:55.919
Did you join
the Mile-High Club?

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.253
We didn't even kiss.

01:10:57.294 --> 01:10:58.755
Of course,
I was so nervous

01:10:58.796 --> 01:11:00.090
that I was
talking incessantly

01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:01.841
and didn't give him
the chance to.

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:04.635
Yeah. Well, you did get
to fly on a private jet.

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:06.930
That makes
you a winner;
I am a loser.

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:09.473
I stayed at the Pit and
drank coffee all night.

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:10.600
Loser!

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:12.769
(both laugh)

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.353
Hey, uh, cool tattoo.

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:16.480
What does it mean?

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:19.776
Um... it's the Chinese symbol
for friendship,

01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:22.278
'cause, you know,
friends are cool.

01:11:22.319 --> 01:11:23.738
Naomi has the same one.

01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:27.366
Yeah.

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:31.495
(groans softly):
All right...

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:33.664
in eighth grade,
my dad had an affair

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:35.499
with my mom's best friend.

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:38.128
(laughs):
I was... God,
I was so angry.

01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:41.505
You know, so
unbelievably scared

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:45.093
that she'd find out, you know,
and she'd get a divorce

01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:47.845
or... start drinking again.

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:51.682
So I... I didn't tell anybody,
I kept it a secret,

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:54.852
but then it started
eating away at me,
and I just...

01:11:54.894 --> 01:11:56.229
I had to tell someone.

01:11:56.271 --> 01:12:00.066
So... I told
my best friend, Naomi.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.987
She promised me that
she wouldn't tell anyone.

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:07.698
So she told everyone.
Why-why would she

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.366
do that?

01:12:09.408 --> 01:12:12.036
Because she needs to know
more than anyone else.

01:12:12.078 --> 01:12:15.581
Because it gives her power
to tear people down.

01:12:15.623 --> 01:12:17.083
So...

01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:18.251
my mom found out.

01:12:18.293 --> 01:12:20.253
She confronted my dad,

01:12:20.295 --> 01:12:24.590
and everything that I prayed
wouldn't happen happened.

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:27.969
So...

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:32.182
now it is my greatest pleasure
to make her pay for it.

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:35.726
Wow.

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:37.478
I'm sorry.

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:48.656
Adrianna... hey.

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:49.824
Hi.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:52.368
Listen, um, how
was the audition?

01:12:52.409 --> 01:12:55.038
Oh, it was great!
Really great.

01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:57.456
Actually, um, it's
between me and one
other girl,

01:12:57.498 --> 01:12:59.876
so keep you fingers
crossed.

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:01.418
Wow, I will.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.129
Hey, congratulations.

01:13:03.171 --> 01:13:04.797
Thank you.

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:11.637
You didn't have
to do that, man.

01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:12.680
Don't worry
about it, man.

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:13.806
It was my idea anyway.

01:13:13.848 --> 01:13:15.808
Yeah, but now he cut
you from the team.

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:17.852
Yeah, but there
were other guys
on the team

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:19.395
who had nothing
to do with it.

01:13:19.436 --> 01:13:20.813
And they would have
been screwed

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:21.814
for the whole season.

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:23.149
I had to do it, man.

01:13:23.191 --> 01:13:24.901
See you later.

put him back on the team?

01:13:37.372 --> 01:13:40.333
Hey, Mr. Wilson.

01:13:40.375 --> 01:13:42.585
What can I do
for you, Mr. Ward?

01:13:43.794 --> 01:13:47.506
Dixon didn't do it
alone. I helped.

01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:49.508
So, I mean,

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:52.011
if you suspend him,
you have to suspend me.

01:13:52.053 --> 01:13:53.596
Me, too.

01:13:53.637 --> 01:13:55.348
Navid, you, too?

01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:58.226
They're my pigs, sir,
and I can prove it.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:02.105
They respond
to their names
when called.

01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:04.399
Really?

01:14:08.069 --> 01:14:09.237
Hey.
Hey.

01:14:09.279 --> 01:14:11.948
Look what I found
in my daughter's pocket.

01:14:11.989 --> 01:14:13.449
San Francisco, Annie?

01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:22.417
ANNIE:
I was just so bummed
about Jason,

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:25.086
and Ty was fun and nice,

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:26.754
and I knew
you would say no.

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:29.299
Wait a minute.
I said yes to a date
on a school night,

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:30.967
which I thought was
pretty cool of me.

01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:32.927
I'm sorry if I have
to draw the line

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:34.262
at my 15-year-old
daughter jetting off

01:14:34.304 --> 01:14:36.222
to San Francisco
with a guy

01:14:36.264 --> 01:14:37.432
she barely knows.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:38.808
That's what kids
here do.

01:14:38.849 --> 01:14:40.601
They have planes
and they go places

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:42.019
and they don't
tell their parents

01:14:42.061 --> 01:14:43.604
'cause it's no big deal.

01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:46.190
It takes an hour to get
to San Francisco by jet,

01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:49.402
and that's like being
in traffic on Sunset.

01:14:49.444 --> 01:14:51.070
We have rules, Annie!

01:14:51.112 --> 01:14:52.947
What if you're somewhere
and we don't know where,

01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:54.240
and you get hurt?

01:14:54.282 --> 01:14:56.575
I will work with you, but I
have to be able to trust you,

01:14:56.617 --> 01:14:57.701
and right now I don't know

01:14:57.743 --> 01:14:59.287
when I'm gonna be able
to do that again.

01:14:59.329 --> 01:15:01.372
Are you gonna tell Dad?

01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:03.540
Of course, I'm gonna tell Dad.

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:06.627

01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:15.886
why him...
in front of everyone?

01:15:15.928 --> 01:15:17.888
Well, I guess I just did to you
what you did to me.

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:19.640
What I did to you was terrible.

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:21.267
I feel horrible.

01:15:21.309 --> 01:15:24.228
But, I mean, I hurt you,
you hurt me.

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:25.646
Is that how it works with us?

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:27.898
I wouldn't do that to a friend,

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:29.900
and we're supposed
to be more than friends.

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:31.402
But we are more than that.

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:33.946
We're more than friends, Ethan.

01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:36.324
And we've fought before.
We always work it out.

01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:43.706

why I did it.

01:15:43.747 --> 01:15:45.541
I said I didn't know.

01:15:47.293 --> 01:15:49.003

01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:54.842
I wanted out.

01:16:00.181 --> 01:16:02.266

01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:05.769

Wasn't fair of me
to ask you to give
up your buddies.
