00:00.615 --> 00:01.930
All right, Mrs. Cropper,

00:01.931 --> 00:04.143
I think you'll gonna be fine without the antibiotics

00:04.144 --> 00:06.759
And you don't think that I'll need a pelvic exam?

00:06.760 --> 00:08.434
But not for the cold, no

00:11.453 --> 00:12.849
Do it with the gloves off.

00:12.850 --> 00:15.825
Ok. Either step a side, or I'm gonna go through you

00:15.826 --> 00:17.215
Then you go through me...

00:17.216 --> 00:18.911
you go through me hard.

00:19.479 --> 00:22.836
Mrs. Cropper wasn't the only one showing agression

00:23.267 --> 00:25.751
Every since Turk visited his bother last month,

00:25.752 --> 00:27.460
he'd been more alpha-male than ever

00:27.461 --> 00:28.455
All right,

00:28.456 --> 00:30.619
we all know the rules of remote wrestling

00:30.620 --> 00:33.449
last man standing decides what we watch.

00:34.656 --> 00:36.156

00:57.662 --> 01:00.316
Thank you for let me think about it.

01:11.070 --> 01:12.029
Right here.

01:12.324 --> 01:15.080
I can't believe I've never said this to you,

01:15.081 --> 01:17.134
nobody cares whats you think.

01:19.842 --> 01:20.858
Listen, guys.

01:20.859 --> 01:24.218
It's come to my attention that nobody around here cares what we think.

01:24.219 --> 01:25.346
Tell me about it.

01:29.951 --> 01:30.907
But no!

01:31.219 --> 01:32.296
Exactly.

01:32.297 --> 01:33.256
Sort of.

01:33.257 --> 01:36.893
I've figured a way to get our voices heard, ok?

01:36.894 --> 01:38.847
It's a little news letter called...

01:38.848 --> 01:40.237
Brace yourselves...

01:41.145 --> 01:43.162
Seriously, brace yourselves.

01:43.469 --> 01:45.141
The Janitorial

01:51.881 --> 01:53.024
Todd has a question.

01:53.025 --> 01:54.958
Yes, could I be the photographer,

01:54.959 --> 01:57.122
so I have a value excuse for wearing this?

02:09.729 --> 02:13.048
What I need, is an investigate of reporter.

02:13.638 --> 02:17.394
Somebody, who is blend enough, insignificant enough

02:17.395 --> 02:20.386
that he'll be listening in a private conversation

02:20.387 --> 02:24.160
get the secrets, but nobody even know if he was there.

02:25.156 --> 02:26.484
I'll do it!

02:27.144 --> 02:28.939
Have you been sitting here all time?

02:28.940 --> 02:32.325
No, first I was in your chair, but you sat on my lap,

02:32.326 --> 02:33.825
remember?

02:34.700 --> 02:37.688
I said "excuse me", and you said "get up and sit over there"

02:37.689 --> 02:39.470
and I did.

02:40.103 --> 02:41.136
Right?

02:41.394 --> 02:42.513
And...

02:42.771 --> 02:44.099
Hey, Janitor?

02:44.320 --> 02:45.500
Oh, hey, Ted!

03:00.607 --> 03:02.624
Rate Dr.Reid's butt?

03:03.398 --> 03:05.316
Yes, 9.2!

03:09.743 --> 03:11.546
Come down, Enid.

03:11.743 --> 03:15.764
It's not my fault that I've been forced down out my job.

03:24.358 --> 03:25.648
Now Enid...

03:25.649 --> 03:27.438
I've got to go back to work...

03:33.498 --> 03:37.260
Don't be too pleased with that 9.2, that's out 100.

03:43.439 --> 03:46.747
Dr.Cox, can Sam watch West Side Story?

03:46.748 --> 03:48.210
Helps him fall sleep.

03:48.211 --> 03:50.169
And it makes my heart sing...

03:58.663 --> 04:01.651
All right, I just do it in my head then.

04:03.956 --> 04:05.824
Wow, we're watching the game

04:06.685 --> 04:09.353
Put that remote down or be prepared to wrestle.

04:09.354 --> 04:13.387
Who ordered to care whop ass? I think you did...

04:13.778 --> 04:15.511
I want you to see this.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.303
Do you see a TV from there, buddy?

04:24.339 --> 04:28.126
Unfortunately, you're going to have to get used to events like this.

04:28.421 --> 04:31.527
Don't... listen... to him... Sam...

04:31.626 --> 04:33.814

Dude...

05:13.072 --> 05:15.250
Oh, sorry, Tracy and Stacy.

05:15.717 --> 05:18.637
See you, guys, are wearing each others oxygen mask(?).

05:19.049 --> 05:20.230
That's cute.

05:20.721 --> 05:21.959
All right, they win.

05:24.996 --> 05:26.399
-Get two!
-I know.

05:51.790 --> 05:55.491
It's great having a silver bullets like that on everyone in a hospital.

05:55.492 --> 05:57.882
-You sure told him.
-Thanks, herpis.

05:59.748 --> 06:00.768
I'm so sorry

06:03.252 --> 06:05.934
Oh, sweetheart, you should. It's your fault.

06:25.346 --> 06:27.823
Don't help me. And keep this to yourself.

06:28.610 --> 06:30.233
That'll be our secret!

06:30.661 --> 06:32.912
This is your new patient John, what's your secret?

06:32.913 --> 06:34.224
I can't tell.

06:34.225 --> 06:36.191
And besides, you are terrible in keeping secrets.

06:36.192 --> 06:38.589
You know, my brothers are great in keeping secrets.

06:43.233 --> 06:44.720
There was only for a second!

06:44.721 --> 06:46.146
Still gay, though...

06:46.323 --> 06:47.725
Told you!

06:48.998 --> 06:49.994
It's official,

06:49.995 --> 06:51.826
The Janitorial is a hit.

06:51.827 --> 06:53.461
But no time to rest,

06:57.668 --> 07:00.556
Doug, the Janitorial is a try daily.

07:03.486 --> 07:04.948
I'm right here.

07:05.286 --> 07:07.376
I bought you that scone.

07:15.443 --> 07:16.922
I'm kidding, Ted.

07:19.474 --> 07:21.466
Actually, I was't kidding.

07:22.388 --> 07:24.196
Todd, how's the weather section shaping up?

07:42.527 --> 07:44.604
You called me stupid?

07:44.605 --> 07:47.504
Well, it's your stupid paper, right? So...

07:47.627 --> 07:49.041
yeah, you're stupid.

07:50.487 --> 07:51.526
And...

07:51.527 --> 07:52.522
Done.

07:53.457 --> 07:55.276
What did I miss?

08:14.164 --> 08:15.159
Hey, dude...

08:15.368 --> 08:16.720
I want you to let him go.

08:16.757 --> 08:18.715
I don't have a problem with you, man.

08:18.924 --> 08:21.334
I should warn you, I've killed the man.

08:27.061 --> 08:29.333
-Sorry.
-That's why. Walk away!

08:29.334 --> 08:30.404
Walk away!

08:30.478 --> 08:31.461
We got him.

08:31.462 --> 08:32.759
Well, that was a close one, wasn't it?

08:32.760 --> 08:35.155
Thank godness, your big brave man friend was here.

08:35.763 --> 08:36.759
Sam,

08:37.201 --> 08:39.291
I wanna be real clear about this:

08:39.292 --> 08:40.619
that's your daddy.

08:40.852 --> 08:42.168
Not your mommy.

08:42.736 --> 08:44.630
How you get Sam out of day care?

09:07.180 --> 09:08.992
I'll be right here.

09:10.190 --> 09:11.149
It's a nice guy, isn't he?

09:11.150 --> 09:13.706
He's incredible, what's your secret?

09:13.952 --> 09:15.422
Aah, are you pregnant?

09:18.198 --> 09:21.333
-It's his baby.
-That was one dream, Carla!

09:24.575 --> 09:25.903
Which have?

10:12.550 --> 10:13.927
I'm kidding, Ted.

10:14.099 --> 10:15.980
I don't wanna eat it again.

10:16.017 --> 10:17.013
Ted.

10:21.642 --> 10:23.241
Here's John's labwork.

10:23.242 --> 10:26.339
If you tell me your secret, I won't tell anybody about the time you ate a cricket.

10:59.566 --> 11:01.852
But dude, that's my job, remember?

11:01.853 --> 11:04.447
When Sam gets older I'll teach him about sports and stuff,

11:09.329 --> 11:10.673
Turk, we are not married.

11:10.674 --> 11:12.155
Dude, we are little married.

11:12.156 --> 11:13.671
I know, I love it.

11:19.234 --> 11:20.276
You know?

11:21.570 --> 11:23.110
That's it! I am a man,

11:41.663 --> 11:42.694
Thank you.

11:50.846 --> 11:52.424
I feel alone too...

11:55.567 --> 11:56.598
Oh no...

12:11.158 --> 12:12.151
Get up!

12:14.356 --> 12:16.033
I knew I had two choices.

12:16.034 --> 12:18.456
Apologize to Turk and admit it was an accident.

12:18.457 --> 12:19.446
Or this...

12:20.142 --> 12:22.279
Yeah, how you like me now, bitch!

12:27.286 --> 12:28.602
So uncool.

12:31.170 --> 12:33.009
I'm gonna kill him... where...

12:44.087 --> 12:45.469
Why are you here?

12:55.002 --> 12:56.424
Could question?

12:56.505 --> 12:59.064
How can I possibly have breast cancer?

12:59.065 --> 13:00.555
Anyone can get it, John.

13:30.708 --> 13:31.663
What?

13:31.664 --> 13:34.981
No, Dr.Kelso, my cousin didn,t hang himself, ok?

13:35.784 --> 13:37.921
He did, but he lived.

13:38.145 --> 13:39.536
That's a nice story.

13:40.918 --> 13:41.956
Stop, stop,

13:41.957 --> 13:43.104
stop it, please...

13:43.193 --> 13:44.339
There is no touching.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.491
No please, no touching me...

13:45.492 --> 13:47.659
Ok, everyone! Can I get your attention?

13:47.784 --> 13:50.005
That interview is a fake.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.138
It never happens.

13:51.139 --> 13:51.873
So,

13:52.016 --> 13:53.681
there is no more touching me.

13:53.825 --> 13:55.436
not now, not never!

13:55.848 --> 13:57.102
Knock, knock, knock.

14:07.290 --> 14:08.679
You've the interview too?

14:08.950 --> 14:09.712
What interview?

14:17.306 --> 14:18.019
Oh, thank God,

14:18.020 --> 14:20.085
Turk will never beat me in front of Carla.

14:22.704 --> 14:23.798
What is John's problem?

14:23.982 --> 14:25.974
Yeah, Carla, what is his problem?

14:59.747 --> 15:01.653
One testicle.

15:08.092 --> 15:09.666
These conditions are perfect.

15:17.926 --> 15:19.856
He's a beautiful.

15:20.115 --> 15:22.414
Oh my God! It is totally awesome.

15:35.661 --> 15:37.788
Stop, Turk, you're making him cry.

15:40.161 --> 15:41.956
It's ok, plant Turk.

15:42.675 --> 15:43.739
Friends.

15:47.172 --> 15:49.238
See? He's learning.

15:55.269 --> 15:56.646
We have to find your ball, Turk.

15:56.831 --> 15:58.945
We have to find it and destroy it.

16:09.464 --> 16:11.973
Look at him, he's dying in there.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.092
Good, he's not dying.

17:09.425 --> 17:10.028
Josh.

17:13.550 --> 17:15.898
Fair enough.

17:16.605 --> 17:17.269
I'm sorry.

17:17.944 --> 17:18.892
Apologize accepted.

17:35.853 --> 17:36.935
Occupied!

17:42.578 --> 17:43.279
I know!

17:43.340 --> 17:45.603
Stupid doctor-patient confident 

17:45.687 --> 17:46.670
It's like to be silenced.

17:46.707 --> 17:47.875
It's like last month,

18:15.909 --> 18:16.709
Oh my God.

18:17.932 --> 18:19.592
Dr Kelso wants my help.

18:19.870 --> 18:22.562
I swear, Elliot, if you don't tell me this secret,

18:28.755 --> 18:29.948
So which one's you lose?

18:36.032 --> 18:36.850
How did it happened?

18:39.794 --> 18:40.962
That sucks.

19:01.693 --> 19:02.780
I'm not really sure.

19:07.839 --> 19:09.108
Turk, if you not being listening...

19:09.167 --> 19:09.767
Sam.

19:09.983 --> 19:10.741
Rule model.

19:10.839 --> 19:11.941
I have to win.

19:12.791 --> 19:13.952
So what's you wanna do?

19:14.001 --> 19:15.644
And then we had it.

19:27.822 --> 19:28.609
Check out the scar.

19:39.419 --> 19:40.236
This is brilliant.

19:40.570 --> 19:41.691
I've thought you'd like it.

19:42.919 --> 19:45.698
It can even make so afraid to ask for a help, bur instead

19:46.190 --> 19:48.462
we just quietly hope for someone to notice.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.238
Dr.Kelso, I told Carla your secret

19:52.239 --> 19:53.575
we'll gonna help you.

19:53.733 --> 19:55.632
We're going to try to regroup all of the hospital

19:59.834 --> 20:02.077
Are you in on this too, Perry?

20:02.342 --> 20:02.687
Nope.
