00:00.834 --> 00:02.973
Narrator:
In New York City war on crime,

00:03.003 --> 00:06.678
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:06.707 --> 00:08.618
of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.642 --> 00:10.178
These are their stories.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.151
Don't you put me off, Bernard.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.218
I've been trying to reach you all morning.

00:18.085 --> 00:21.157
I can't do this over the phone.
I'm coming down to the city.

00:21.188 --> 00:24.192
Yes, it's that important.

00:24.224 --> 00:28.195
Prototype just arrived.
You should be very proud.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.801
Gloria, I--

00:31.832 --> 00:34.369
I've got to go home.

00:34.401 --> 00:37.348
This kid emergency, and I--

00:37.371 --> 00:39.248
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:41.108 --> 00:43.520
Man: Americans always panic.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.047
Don't patronize me.

00:46.079 --> 00:48.286
This is potentially ruinous to both of us.

00:48.315 --> 00:50.192
Who else knows?

00:50.217 --> 00:53.391
She didn't say. My impression is
it's new information.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.798
I don't think she told anybody else.

00:55.822 --> 00:58.928
- Will she take money?
- it's not about that with her.

00:58.959 --> 01:01.098
She's worried about her reputation.

01:01.128 --> 01:02.766
Okay.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.833
Okay what?

01:04.864 --> 01:07.368
I'll help you.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.278
I have to go back to the studio tonight.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.180
Again? Bernie--

01:11.204 --> 01:13.582
- Listen, could you not--
- Could I not what?

01:13.607 --> 01:16.213
We've been talking for months
about your taking on less work.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.450
- I'm still tied up with a few things.
- Bernie,

01:18.478 --> 01:22.483
you're exhausted all the time
and stressed out. It's not worth it.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.053
So we have less money. Big deal.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.929
You know? Big deal.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.968
(buzzer sounds)

01:47.107 --> 01:50.054
I'm sorry. I couldn't find a cab and--

01:52.479 --> 01:54.755
I thought this was going to be private.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.317
Mr. Langer knows all about it.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.888
I'm sure we can sort this out
like civilized people, my dear.

02:01.521 --> 02:04.866
That's hard to imagine
with the position you've put me in.

02:06.259 --> 02:08.967
This can work to your advantage.

02:10.896 --> 02:12.376
(buzzer sounds)

02:12.399 --> 02:14.504
Now who's that?

02:28.649 --> 02:31.095
Bernard? Bernard, where are you?

02:31.118 --> 02:32.825
Didn't you hear the phone--

02:32.853 --> 02:35.026
Oh my God.

02:49.369 --> 02:51.508
( theme music playing )

03:36.483 --> 03:38.895
The wife ID'd this one. Bernard Jackson.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.796
Some kind of art authenticator.

03:40.821 --> 03:44.064
My LT thought we should call you
guys on account of the art angle.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.367
This one's about art?
You better call the mayor, too.

03:46.393 --> 03:49.636
The wife said that's her husband's
.38 which he kept for protection.

03:49.663 --> 03:52.143
She doesn't know the hanging beauty.

03:52.165 --> 03:55.544
Anne Ellis. ID from the Champlain
Museum of Art up in Troy.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.106
She's the curator.

03:58.138 --> 04:01.483
Pictures, car keys, hotel passkey.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.249
What's Mrs. Jackson's story?

04:03.276 --> 04:06.382
Bernard was working late.
When he didn't come home in the morning,

04:06.413 --> 04:08.791
she cabbed it down here.
Found everything as is.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.257
She's got gunpowder on the right one.

04:13.286 --> 04:15.027
We'll, do a test, just to be sure.

04:15.055 --> 04:18.593
Test her shirt and sleeve.
I want to see the dispersal pattern.

04:18.625 --> 04:22.505
And check the box cutter near
the spool for prints.

04:22.529 --> 04:26.671
Popular opinion's got this
pegged as a murder-suicide.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.238
I never trust opinion polls.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.740
This rope is frayed down to here.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.947
- She was hoisted up?
- Could be.

04:35.976 --> 04:39.446
Officer: The fraying doesn't mean
anything one way or the other.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.727
Does this mean anything?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.062
( blows )

04:58.765 --> 05:01.041
Glasses are missing.

05:02.869 --> 05:05.645
Yes, and probably washed.

05:05.672 --> 05:08.881
Tell the ME's to run a tox on both victims

05:08.909 --> 05:11.515
for alcohol and sedatives.

05:19.553 --> 05:23.592
Well, I think we're ready to see Mrs. Jackson.

05:23.623 --> 05:27.264
I've been told they want to check my hands
for gunpowder, as if I shot Bernie.

05:27.294 --> 05:30.332
- It's just routine procedure.
- It's not routine for me.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.843
I don't know what I'm going to do now.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.403
We're very sorry for your loss.

05:35.435 --> 05:38.211
The dead woman's name is Anne Ellis.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.411
She's the curator at a museum up in Troy.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.717
- Your husband ever mention her?
- No.

05:43.743 --> 05:45.745
Maybe he was doing some work for her.

05:45.779 --> 05:49.522
Are you sure their relationship

05:49.549 --> 05:51.790
was strictly... professional?

05:51.818 --> 05:54.458
It had to be.

05:54.487 --> 05:57.900
4 months ago my husband had prostate surgery.

05:57.924 --> 05:59.961
It affected his--

05:59.993 --> 06:03.873
nothing we tried worked.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.672
He was planning to slow down,

06:05.699 --> 06:08.441
maybe go back to teaching
at the Art Institute.

06:08.468 --> 06:11.608
The surgery really scared him.

06:11.638 --> 06:14.380
Why would that woman do this to him?

06:16.309 --> 06:18.255
You say double homicide, this test says

06:18.278 --> 06:20.485
the dead woman's hand
was positive for gunpowder.

06:20.513 --> 06:23.494
The back-blast pattern's wrong.
There was no residue on her shirt.

06:23.516 --> 06:26.122
And the ME's found enough
Ruphinol in her system

06:26.152 --> 06:27.358
to knock out a horse.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.628
Does it work the other way?
He slips her a mickey,

06:29.656 --> 06:31.397
strings her up, and shoots himself?

06:31.424 --> 06:34.030
Doesn't jibe with the blast
pattern around his wound.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.631
A double homicide it is.
What about Jackson's wife?

06:36.663 --> 06:40.076
No gunpowder on her. Her doorman has
her home until 6:00 in the morning.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.843
And Anne Ellie's husband was home
in Troy all night with their kid.

06:43.870 --> 06:47.079
That checks out with the calls he
made to her hotel during the night.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.417
All right, I'm going to give
this one last shot.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.388
This guy kept a lot of art in his workshop.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.857
I saw a Tibetan thangka worth over 100 grand,

06:53.880 --> 06:56.622
a Goya etching worth a half a mil easy.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.654
A Chinese blue and white
moon vase worth 200 grand.

06:59.686 --> 07:02.997
A lot of stuff that would've
been easy pickings in a robbery.

07:03.023 --> 07:06.334
All my favorite theories
shot to hell in 60 seconds.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.134
Anything in her hotel room?

07:08.161 --> 07:10.038
An overnight bag, no sexy lingerie.

07:10.063 --> 07:14.068
There's a Mr. Ellis here.
Says he's supposed to talk to you.

07:19.439 --> 07:23.353
She was found hanging
in the workshop of Bernard Jackson.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.117
She had been drugged.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.489
What was she doing there?

07:27.514 --> 07:30.051
Eames: We were hoping you could tell us.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.222
I don't know who Bernard Jackson is.

07:32.252 --> 07:35.631
This was a business trip
for the museum, kinda last minute.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.598
She made a lot of business trips to the city?

07:39.626 --> 07:43.631
Last few months, every couple of weeks.

07:43.663 --> 07:47.338
She found these donors who were
giving a painting to the museum.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.278
Monet.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.408
A painting like that, that's...

07:53.440 --> 07:55.078
Quite a coup for a small museum.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.815
It was very important to her

07:56.843 --> 08:01.087
She spent a lot of time
sucking up to these people.

08:01.114 --> 08:04.687
I thought that's who she was
seeing last night.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.163
You know their names?

08:06.186 --> 08:10.566
Blunt. Rachel and Bill, I think.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.900
Annie said they had a big place

08:12.926 --> 08:15.566
on 5th Avenue just up from the Met.

08:15.595 --> 08:18.337
Oh, God.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.874
What the hell happened to her?

08:28.942 --> 08:31.320
Eames: She didn't call you at all that day?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.482
No. Neither did Bernard.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.356
Bernard Jackson? You knew him as well?

08:35.381 --> 08:37.554
He authenticated the Monet
when we bought it.

08:37.583 --> 08:39.655
Goren: You bought it at auction?

08:39.686 --> 08:42.462
Uh, no. From a collector in Europe.

08:42.489 --> 08:45.493
Whose idea was it to donate
it to the Champlain Museum?

08:45.525 --> 08:49.337
Rachel spent her summers in the area.
Thought it would be a nice gesture.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.739
Bernard gave me the idea.

08:50.764 --> 08:54.678
He'd said places like the Met have more
art than they know what to do with.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.511
- But up in Troy--
- Our little Monet would be a star.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.346
That's what Bernard said.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.320
You like art, Detective?

09:02.342 --> 09:05.152
I like this. It's a Lachaise.

09:05.178 --> 09:08.489
Bronze. One of only three cast from the mold.

09:09.582 --> 09:11.493
How do you know?

09:11.518 --> 09:13.998
Does it have a number on the bottom?

09:14.020 --> 09:16.193
There's no number.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.897
It's just a documented fact.

09:19.926 --> 09:22.736
Eames: Were you aware Jackson and Mrs.
Ellis knew each other?

09:22.762 --> 09:24.708
They met because of our Monet.

09:24.731 --> 09:29.009
- But we didn't know how well
they knew each other.
- Oh.

09:29.035 --> 09:31.515
You think there was something going on there?

09:31.538 --> 09:35.350
Well, murder-suicide speaks
for itself, doesn't it?

09:36.309 --> 09:38.152
It certainly does.

09:39.512 --> 09:42.322
When's the last time
you spoke with Mrs. Ellis?

09:43.383 --> 09:44.953
A few days ago.

09:44.984 --> 09:48.557
But there was supposed to be a little
ceremony to dedicate the new gallery.

09:48.588 --> 09:52.263
But she said it was going to have to
be postponed a couple of weeks.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.703
She say why?

09:53.726 --> 09:55.535
Um...

09:55.562 --> 09:58.839
Some problem with the contractor.
They botched the lighting.

09:58.865 --> 10:02.403
Right. It's a Monet. It's all in the lighting.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.914
Thank you.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.509
They're simply investigating the tragic end

10:07.540 --> 10:09.747
of a tragic love affair.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.653
He tried to pretend he didn't,

10:11.678 --> 10:13.749
but one of them knew a lot about art.

10:13.780 --> 10:17.455
And where did he come by this
knowledge, at the police academy?

10:17.484 --> 10:19.293
Come on, William,

10:19.319 --> 10:21.890
even the art world
doesn't know a lot about art.

10:21.921 --> 10:24.299
You said nothing could go wrong.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.235
Nothing has gone wrong.

10:26.259 --> 10:29.365
Jackson just could not keep it in his pants.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.839
How could he have been so stupid

10:32.866 --> 10:35.278
getting involved with that girl?

10:35.301 --> 10:37.338
Look on the bright side--

10:37.370 --> 10:39.748
if anything does go wrong,

10:39.772 --> 10:42.048
we can always blame Jackson.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.316
He's hardly in a position to deny it.

10:48.515 --> 10:50.722
It's beautiful.

10:51.718 --> 10:54.130
Impressionists are too pretty.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.795
Right. You probably like those sweaty
naked people in the next room.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.395
Lucien Freud? As a matter of fact, I do.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.269
You can't put that stuff in your home.

11:02.295 --> 11:05.003
- You can't live with it.
- I'm not interested in living with it,

11:05.031 --> 11:07.443
I'm interested in thinking about it.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.845
Woman: Hello.

11:09.869 --> 11:12.076
I see you found our treasure.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.312
- Exquisite, isn't it?
- it's beautiful.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.684
It's destined to be Annie's
legacy, I'm afraid.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.746
She worked so hard to line up the donation--

11:18.778 --> 11:21.122
the funding to build this gallery.

11:21.147 --> 11:22.649
She had a lot riding on it?

11:22.682 --> 11:24.389
Well, we're not a rich museum.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.624
The added security alone is a burden.

11:26.653 --> 11:30.066
But a $10 million gift will put us on the map.

11:30.089 --> 11:34.128
We heard the gallery dedication was
postponed because of a lighting problem.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.300
The lighting? Oh, no.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.605
No, the Blunts had a last minute conflict.

11:38.631 --> 11:41.578
Annie was adamant we couldn't
go ahead without them.

11:42.835 --> 11:45.338
Could we see her office?

11:45.371 --> 11:46.873
Mm-hmm.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.486
I can't tell you how shocked we were.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.890
Annie was the last person we expected to--

11:54.914 --> 11:56.325
well, you know.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.821
- Die?
- I mean in those circumstances.

12:00.853 --> 12:03.697
I can only imagine how her husband must feel.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.670
Have you heard of the Vaughn-Dixon
Chem-Test company?

12:10.697 --> 12:14.372
- No.
- They're in New Mexico.

12:14.400 --> 12:18.348
They sent Annie a receipt to test
paint chips from an oil painting.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.577
I don't see why.

12:19.606 --> 12:23.076
We use two companies here,
in New York and in New Jersey.

12:23.109 --> 12:26.556
She probably didn't want anyone
to know she was having tests done.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.685
This says that the test
on the paint was inconclusive.

12:29.716 --> 12:31.696
What paint?

12:33.553 --> 12:37.023
Well, apparently Annie thought
your exquisite Monet

12:37.056 --> 12:39.536
might be an exquisite fake.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.936
The museum just let you take their painting?

12:45.965 --> 12:47.410
With the help of a court order.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.812
They're afraid of looking like idiots
if it turns out it's a forgery.

12:50.837 --> 12:53.443
If it is, it's a damn good one.
The paints were hand-made

12:53.473 --> 12:55.646
by grinding naturally occurring minerals,

12:55.675 --> 12:58.622
mixing them with linseed oil.
It's the way Monet would've done it.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.886
You found cadmium red in the paint.

13:00.913 --> 13:03.689
- Didn't they use Vermillion back then?
- Only until 1872.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.992
That's 4 years before
the date of this painting.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.329
"Green specks of unknown origin."

13:08.354 --> 13:10.425
Yeah, well, we're still working on that one.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.801
Maybe Madame Monet dropped some
green beans in the paint bucket.

13:13.826 --> 13:16.170
- What about the canvas?
- Mid-19th century.

13:16.195 --> 13:19.267
Forgers take paintings by unknown
artists of the same period,

13:19.299 --> 13:21.643
strip them down to the canvas
and paint over them.

13:21.668 --> 13:24.842
Then what would've tipped off
Annie that it might be a fake?

13:24.871 --> 13:27.784
The craquelure of the paint varnish.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.414
When it's-- when it ages naturally,

13:31.444 --> 13:33.219
the cracks are uneven.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.226
When it's aged artificially,

13:35.248 --> 13:39.162
the cracks have a uniform pattern like this.

13:39.185 --> 13:41.187
- You did your homework.
- Yeah.

13:41.220 --> 13:43.496
- (beeping)
- Okay...

13:43.523 --> 13:46.163
Here's how it works.

13:46.192 --> 13:49.765
1945 on-- Hiroshima, Nagasaki,

13:49.796 --> 13:52.800
A-bomb tests, worldwide radiation
levels go through the roof.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.971
Radiation is absorbed by every living thing,

13:55.001 --> 13:56.981
including linseed, which finds its way

13:57.003 --> 14:00.348
into oil paints mixed after 1945.

14:00.373 --> 14:03.752
Paintings made after 1945
have a higher radiation level.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.450
Which this one shouldn't have, but does.

14:06.479 --> 14:09.926
This Monet was painted at least
30 years after Monet died.

14:09.949 --> 14:12.054
Wouldn't he be surprised?

14:13.686 --> 14:16.292
If he knew who the previous
owner was, he wrote it down.

14:16.322 --> 14:18.666
But I couldn't tell you where
he kept those records.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.534
Do you think that's who killed Bernie?

14:20.560 --> 14:22.972
Seeing as they sold a forgery
to the Blunts for millions,

14:22.995 --> 14:24.702
they have a pretty good motive.

14:24.731 --> 14:27.575
You're not saying Bernie
knew it was a forgery?

14:28.568 --> 14:31.276
Our experts think he did.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.011
We're sorry.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.041
He could've been fooled.

14:35.074 --> 14:37.076
It could have been an honest mistake.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.284
Why? He's made mistakes before?

14:40.313 --> 14:42.623
He used to work almost exclusively

14:42.648 --> 14:44.491
for an insurance company.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.828
Last year, it was discovered
a rare Greek statue

14:47.854 --> 14:50.130
he authenticated for a museum in Los Angeles

14:50.156 --> 14:52.466
turned out to be a Roman copy.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.529
And the company let him go?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.403
It worked out for the best.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.409
He was making more money freelancing.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.342
- For RSL Galleries.
- Among others.

15:00.366 --> 15:03.438
He authenticated the Monet for them.
They must've handled the sale.

15:03.469 --> 15:06.279
We got 11 invoices to RSL,

15:06.305 --> 15:08.683
half dozen to other clients.

15:08.708 --> 15:12.656
- Totals just over 100 grand.
- No, that can't be right.

15:12.678 --> 15:14.783
Bernie put almost a million dollars

15:14.814 --> 15:16.657
into our accounts over the last year.

15:16.682 --> 15:20.653
- From his art business?
- Yes.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.471
This report is unreliable.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.942
The radiation test didn't lie, Mr. Langer.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.309
Americans are so impressed with science,

15:35.334 --> 15:38.144
when it's as much myth as religion.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.447
There's also the cracking
of the paint varnish.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.111
Again, a matter of opinion.

15:42.141 --> 15:44.849
You'll forgive me if I credit my expertise,

15:44.877 --> 15:48.791
as well as Bernard's, with a bit more
authority than some stupid machine.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.954
Then you're not worried the other paintings

15:50.983 --> 15:53.293
that Jackson authenticated
might be forgeries?

15:53.319 --> 15:56.528
- Not at all.
- Then where did the paintings come from?

15:57.523 --> 16:01.198
From European sellers
who wish to remain anonymous.

16:01.227 --> 16:04.868
How about a list of the paintings
and the American buyers?

16:06.299 --> 16:09.109
That information is also confidential.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.173
Americans are also impressed
with other things, like subpoenas.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.583
We'd be glad to show you
how impressive they can be.

16:15.842 --> 16:18.482
There's nothing in life I enjoy quite as much

16:18.511 --> 16:21.151
as being threatened by a beautiful woman.

16:22.882 --> 16:25.055
Let me get you that list.

16:27.887 --> 16:31.164
Monet's "Spring Violets" was
in the Albertina Museum

16:31.190 --> 16:33.261
...in Vienna in 1935.

16:33.292 --> 16:36.603
But the painting was on loan
from a private collection.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.768
Ursula and David Leibermann.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.005
Lesen sie Deutsch?

16:41.033 --> 16:42.774
Ja, ausrechend.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.373
I learned in the Army.

16:46.906 --> 16:49.079
This day is ever more delightful.

16:49.108 --> 16:51.349
Is that where you got the painting from,

16:51.377 --> 16:52.549
the Leibermann family?

16:52.578 --> 16:56.583
No. They all met an unfortunate end.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.891
Wonderful collection they had. Very tragic.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.596
Here's your information.

17:12.298 --> 17:13.834
Six months ago, Langer sold

17:13.866 --> 17:16.869
"Rainy Night" by Pissarro.

17:16.903 --> 17:20.248
- What's the next painting?
- A Cezanne.

17:22.808 --> 17:24.878
Here. "Rainy Night" by Pissarro,

17:24.911 --> 17:26.481
property of the Abraham family,

17:26.512 --> 17:28.549
Linz, Austria, 1936.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.859
"The Stone Road" by Cezanne,

17:31.884 --> 17:34.421
property of the Sternberg family,

17:34.453 --> 17:36.626
Vienna, 1938.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.761
"Mister Langlois" by Renoir,

17:38.791 --> 17:41.635
property of Julius Schkolnick,
Vienna, 1937.

17:44.096 --> 17:47.475
Langer's paintings were owned
by Jewish families.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.175
And they all met an unfortunate end.

17:56.275 --> 17:59.745
We have the most extensive list
of stolen Jewish art,

17:59.779 --> 18:01.986
thanks ironically to the Nazis themselves.

18:02.014 --> 18:05.427
They kept very precise records.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.988
Uh-huh, here's one. Let
me just check something.

18:08.020 --> 18:11.900
How come alarms didn't go off when
this Monet went out on the market?

18:11.924 --> 18:14.928
These were private sales.
We never knew they were on the market.

18:14.961 --> 18:18.568
Here. Those the paintings on your list?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.512
They're all there. What's this list from?

18:23.536 --> 18:28.849
The manifest of a U-boat that sank
in the North Sea in 1945.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.649
All your paintings were on board,

18:30.676 --> 18:33.088
presumably on their way to South America.

18:34.246 --> 18:38.160
What I don't understand is how could
anyone recover these masterpieces

18:38.184 --> 18:41.393
from the bottom of the ocean?

18:41.420 --> 18:43.798
By painting them yourself.

18:48.594 --> 18:50.665
Maybe the paintings never made it on the sub.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.869
Maybe some Nazi SOB stored them in his attic.

18:52.898 --> 18:56.311
- I nominate one of Langer's relatives.
- I'm betting they're all forgeries.

18:56.335 --> 18:59.043
There's only one way to find out
for sure-- test each painting.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.347
- You have a list. Start dialing.
- We left messages.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.820
- No one's rushing to call back.
- What's that about?

19:03.843 --> 19:05.845
Nobody likes to be told they're a sucker.

19:05.878 --> 19:09.348
Even the Blunts and the Champlain
Museum are disputing the test results.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.658
That's one explanation for their behavior.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.028
Why don't you find the
explanation that works for you?

19:17.890 --> 19:20.393
As for the Renoir we bought from Mr. Langer,

19:20.426 --> 19:22.565
we donated it to the Tufnel Museum.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.735
- The Tufnel?
- It's in Des Plaines, Illinois.

19:25.765 --> 19:26.937
Why that museum?

19:26.966 --> 19:30.243
The bigger museums are
swimming with Impressionists.

19:30.269 --> 19:33.182
- But in Des Plaines--
- Your Renoir would be a star.

19:33.205 --> 19:38.917
- That's precisely what DeWitt said.
- After speaking with Mr. Jackson and Mr. Langer.

19:38.944 --> 19:41.618
We consulted with them, naturally.

19:41.647 --> 19:44.890
If you don't mind me asking, how
much did you pay for the Renoir?

19:44.917 --> 19:46.954
One and a half million dollars.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.398
Bit of a bargain.

19:49.422 --> 19:52.562
Still, a nice gift for a small museum.

19:54.393 --> 19:57.135
Here's the deal. Last year, Mr. DeWitt Foster

19:57.163 --> 19:59.302
decided to exercise his stock options.

19:59.331 --> 20:00.969
Overnight he's worth $20 million.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.243
He thinks his stocks are going to be
worth more if he holds onto them.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.546
- Except the market takes a dive.
- Right.

20:06.572 --> 20:08.609
So now his stocks are worth $3 million.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.621
The crunch comes when he gets his tax bill.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.920
The IRS assessed his taxes based
upon what the stocks were worth

20:13.946 --> 20:15.983
back when he exercised his options.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.996
- When they were worth $20 million.
- He gets a tax bill for $8 million.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.622
He needs to cut his tax bill.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.530
Hence the donation to a museum.

20:22.555 --> 20:26.093
The assessed value of this painting
is $14 million bucks.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.968
That's a $7 million tax break.

20:27.993 --> 20:30.599
And he paid only $1 million-five
for the painting.

20:31.797 --> 20:34.505
That's why they call it a bargain.

20:34.533 --> 20:37.139
- A tax scam?
- A very good tax scam.

20:37.169 --> 20:38.876
- Are the museums in on it?
- Doubtful.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.612
Langer and his clients targeted
small regional museums

20:41.640 --> 20:43.551
who couldn't afford their own testing.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.113
They took Jackson's
authentication at face value.

20:46.145 --> 20:48.125
Except for Mrs. Ellis up in Troy.

20:48.147 --> 20:50.286
Her suspicions gave Jackson second thoughts

20:50.316 --> 20:53.160
about his participation in the scam.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.392
Langer killed them both.

20:55.421 --> 20:58.334
- You think.
- I think.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.166
This scam has a built-in defense--

21:00.192 --> 21:01.796
plausible deniability.

21:01.827 --> 21:04.967
The buyers can claim they didn't
know they were buying forgeries.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.635
Langer can claim he was duped

21:06.665 --> 21:08.906
by whoever supplied him with the paintings.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.608
They all can point their finger at Jackson.

21:11.637 --> 21:14.049
There is one person that
can't say they didn't know.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.984
The forger.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.887
Find him, and the dominoes will fall.

21:21.413 --> 21:24.986
The art theft squad at the FBI might
have a line on this guy.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.429
Talk to them. I need to practice my German.

21:28.487 --> 21:31.696
Tax fraud? How mundane.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.227
But smart, and I like smart.

21:34.260 --> 21:37.207
I want to get one thing straight between us.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.300
It's not a crime selling forgeries

21:39.331 --> 21:42.073
to people who know they're buying forgeries.

21:42.101 --> 21:45.548
Am I correct to assume
murder is still a crime?

21:45.571 --> 21:47.642
Yes.

21:47.673 --> 21:50.244
There's a lot of people
involved here, Mr. Langer.

21:50.276 --> 21:52.517
But we're light on evidence.

21:52.545 --> 21:56.516
If we put pressure on people, someone'll talk.

21:56.549 --> 21:59.052
Why start with me?

21:59.084 --> 22:02.190
(speaking German)

22:10.930 --> 22:14.002
- I have nothing to tell you.
- You have a lot to tell me.

22:15.301 --> 22:17.941
You not only sold those paintings,

22:17.970 --> 22:20.314
you painted them.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.444
What makes you think that?

22:22.474 --> 22:26.422
They were made by a master technician.

22:26.445 --> 22:29.892
Not like Van Meegeren and his fake Vermeers,

22:29.915 --> 22:32.395
but someone who could recreate the--

22:32.418 --> 22:34.364
the work of many artists.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.388
An artist in his own right.

22:36.422 --> 22:39.096
No. This person would have to be

22:39.124 --> 22:41.764
devoid of artistic vision
and an American.

22:42.761 --> 22:46.334
Americans have no idea what art is anymore.

22:47.499 --> 22:50.708
You filled this building with motorcycles...

22:50.736 --> 22:53.376
und called it art.

22:53.405 --> 22:55.544
Is that what you're doing
with these paintings?

22:55.574 --> 22:56.814
Thumbing your nose at us?

22:56.842 --> 23:00.187
Whatever I'm doing, it hardly entails

23:00.212 --> 23:02.385
painting frauds...

23:02.414 --> 23:04.189
And signing someone else's name.

23:04.216 --> 23:08.631
I do not know of any man who could
subjugate his ego to such an extent.

23:13.259 --> 23:16.672
A woman. He said a man's
ego would get in the way.

23:16.695 --> 23:19.938
- Do you have transparencies
of the paintings?
- Yeah.

23:24.303 --> 23:27.182
Reproductions. You make any money at this?

23:27.206 --> 23:30.244
They retail for $500 at art fairs,

23:30.276 --> 23:32.278
cost me $20. You tell me.

23:32.311 --> 23:34.587
Hit the lights.

23:41.020 --> 23:44.467
This is one of the best
forgeries I've seen in a long time.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.367
Tell me about the materials.

23:46.392 --> 23:48.201
Period canvas,

23:48.227 --> 23:50.639
paints hand-mixed with linseed oil.

23:50.663 --> 23:53.269
It's hanging in a museum,

23:53.299 --> 23:56.075
like a couple of yours, I'll bet.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.274
I'll never tell.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.382
Goren: What, you seeing something?

24:03.409 --> 24:05.411
Maybe.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.524
See this?

24:15.554 --> 24:17.864
Yeah, it's like a cut in the paint.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.166
With a palette knife. They all have it.

24:20.192 --> 24:22.069
Crescent shape.

24:26.532 --> 24:29.342
She's gotten good.

24:29.368 --> 24:31.871
- You know her?
- Yeah.

24:31.904 --> 24:36.478
She used to do restorations for
the Met to support her painting.

24:36.508 --> 24:38.852
Name's Sylvia Moon.

24:40.346 --> 24:43.293
You've been saying and
saying it's about to happen.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.762
This is not a good day
to issue ultimatums, my dear.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.594
I want people looking at my paintings.

24:48.620 --> 24:51.328
- They are looking at your paintings.
- You made me promises,

24:51.357 --> 24:53.633
you son of a bitch. You better keep them.

24:56.261 --> 24:58.707
Artists.

24:58.731 --> 25:01.439
You owe me two canvases.

25:01.467 --> 25:03.606
You finish them,

25:03.635 --> 25:05.672
then you get your show.

25:11.410 --> 25:13.117
Goren: Sylvia Moon?

25:13.145 --> 25:14.886
Yes. Who are you?

25:14.913 --> 25:16.915
I'm Detective Eames. This is Detective Goren.

25:16.949 --> 25:20.419
- We need to talk to you.
- I'm in the middle of some work.

25:20.452 --> 25:22.625
We'll only take a few minutes.

25:22.654 --> 25:25.692
Hey, this-- it's nice.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.961
He can't help himself. Can I come in?

25:28.994 --> 25:30.996
I guess so.

25:35.601 --> 25:37.945
Careful. it's still drying.

25:37.970 --> 25:41.816
That smell,
linseed oil--

25:41.840 --> 25:44.081
you grind your own paints.

25:44.109 --> 25:46.020
The pigments are better that way.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.184
Just the way the Impressionists used to do it.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.557
Some of them.

25:50.582 --> 25:52.653
What is it you want to talk about?

25:52.684 --> 25:56.393
- You grind them in this?
- Yes.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.600
I'm sorry, my studio isn't open for tours.

26:02.628 --> 26:05.666
Now, I'm trying to get a show ready.

26:06.799 --> 26:09.040
Eames: Do you know Rudy Langer?

26:09.068 --> 26:10.672
He owns a gallery.

26:10.702 --> 26:13.740
Everybody knows Rudy.

26:13.772 --> 26:16.412
You should put this in your show.

26:18.610 --> 26:20.317
Where's it going to be?

26:20.345 --> 26:23.224
That hasn't been finalized yet.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.956
Yellow tangs, clownfish.

26:25.984 --> 26:29.693
I like your set-up. it's very... relaxing.

26:33.358 --> 26:35.497
This how you control the algae?

26:35.527 --> 26:36.631
Yes.

26:36.662 --> 26:38.733
It says here you crush the tablets

26:38.764 --> 26:40.835
before you put them in the aquarium.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.279
Yes.

26:43.302 --> 26:47.079
You crush these green tablets in there...

26:47.106 --> 26:49.086
Same as your paints.

26:50.776 --> 26:53.052
Yes. Why?

26:53.078 --> 26:56.218
Guess it wasn't the green beans after all.

27:01.987 --> 27:05.196
The chemical analysis showed
the green specks in the paint

27:05.224 --> 27:07.204
were composed of simazine,

27:07.226 --> 27:10.673
which is the active ingredient
in the algae tablets.

27:10.696 --> 27:15.167
You did the Monet, the Renoir, the Cezanne,

27:15.200 --> 27:16.804
and all the other forgeries.

27:16.835 --> 27:18.542
- They're not forgeries.
- Sylvia--

27:18.570 --> 27:21.551
They're original works based on
source material by other artists.

27:21.573 --> 27:23.780
I even signed them with my mark.

27:23.809 --> 27:26.585
Why did you paint them in the first place?

27:26.612 --> 27:28.250
As color exercises.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.557
That's how you learn to paint.
By copying the masters.

27:31.583 --> 27:34.223
They teach you it's okay to pass
them off as the real thing?

27:34.253 --> 27:37.234
I didn't. Rudy knew exactly
what he was getting,

27:37.256 --> 27:38.929
and so did the buyers.

27:38.957 --> 27:41.699
Goren: An original painting by Sylvia Moon?

27:41.727 --> 27:43.070
Yes.

27:44.363 --> 27:48.334
Identical in every respect to a Monet?

27:48.367 --> 27:50.608
Not at all.

27:50.636 --> 27:52.707
Art is about context.

27:52.738 --> 27:54.649
A romanticist like Monet,

27:54.673 --> 27:57.051
painting flowers at the
dawn of the machine age,

27:57.075 --> 27:59.817
isn't the same as a 21st century woman

27:59.845 --> 28:02.621
painting the same flowers
at the dawn of the cyber age.

28:02.648 --> 28:05.094
The message is different.

28:09.555 --> 28:12.399
What was Bernard Jackson's message

28:12.424 --> 28:14.529
when he signed the authentications?

28:14.560 --> 28:16.870
I don't know what you're talking about.

28:16.895 --> 28:19.876
He certified that your painting was a Monet.

28:19.898 --> 28:23.812
I don't know who this person is,

28:23.835 --> 28:27.715
and I have no control over what people
do with my paintings once they buy them.

28:27.739 --> 28:29.946
And that's the bottom line, Detectives.

28:29.975 --> 28:32.182
Now... this interview's over.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.025
A lot of people have bought your work?

28:38.083 --> 28:40.029
I mean...

28:40.052 --> 28:43.124
Aside from color exercises?

28:44.790 --> 28:47.999
There are several collectors very interested.

28:48.026 --> 28:49.664
They're waiting for my new show.

28:49.695 --> 28:51.902
Your new show? Who's putting it on?

28:53.065 --> 28:55.511
- Rudy Langer.
- Well, that's funny.

28:55.534 --> 28:58.344
He told me that...

28:58.370 --> 29:01.874
Only someone devoid of artistic vision

29:01.907 --> 29:04.717
could paint those forgeries.

29:11.149 --> 29:13.026
If she didn't misrepresent her paintings

29:13.051 --> 29:15.463
to Langer or anybody else,
she might be off the hook.

29:15.487 --> 29:18.491
- Doesn't give us much leverage.
- So much for falling dominoes.

29:18.523 --> 29:20.799
Take another run at the Blunts
and the other buyers.

29:20.826 --> 29:22.806
They're all alibied
for the night of the murder,

29:22.828 --> 29:25.172
and they're saying they
were misled by Jackson.

29:25.197 --> 29:27.336
Carver: Seems like we've been here before.

29:27.366 --> 29:29.539
- Sylvia Moon knew Jackson.
- Carver: What?

29:29.568 --> 29:31.605
This is from a group show two years ago.

29:31.637 --> 29:34.481
It says that she graduated from
the New York Art Institute in '91.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.350
Katherine Jackson said her
husband used to teach there.

29:39.244 --> 29:42.885
I knew. Some part of me knew
you were stringing me along!

29:42.914 --> 29:45.326
- Never.
- But to go bragging about it?

29:45.350 --> 29:47.626
To tell the police that I am

29:47.653 --> 29:49.929
"devoid of artistic vision"?!

29:49.955 --> 29:52.128
I had to throw them off the track.

29:52.157 --> 29:54.433
Don't you know what this is like for me?

29:54.459 --> 29:58.339
Can you even conceive what this show meant?

29:58.363 --> 30:00.843
- You can't--
- Sylvia, don't be like this.

30:00.866 --> 30:02.345
We have to be careful now.

30:02.367 --> 30:04.677
I don't care anymore!

30:04.703 --> 30:08.674
Don't look at those! That's bad art!

30:08.707 --> 30:11.415
There's no art in this gallery.

30:11.443 --> 30:13.616
This man is a fraud!

30:13.645 --> 30:15.454
Stop looking!

30:24.589 --> 30:27.229
Yes, Bernard had a reputation.

30:27.259 --> 30:29.205
There were flings with other faculty.

30:29.227 --> 30:31.400
What about the students? Sylvia Moon?

30:31.430 --> 30:34.775
That's a name I haven't heard in a long time.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.007
Yes, there was some involvement.

30:37.035 --> 30:39.641
Bernard had to leave when we found out.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.912
Under threat of a lawsuit,

30:41.940 --> 30:43.817
we allowed Sylvia to graduate.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.753
Or otherwise she wouldn't have graduated?

30:45.777 --> 30:48.587
There was always strong
draftsmanship in her work.

30:48.613 --> 30:50.923
That's not the same thing as artistry.

30:50.949 --> 30:53.225
Was she admitted the same way she graduated?

30:53.251 --> 30:56.755
No. She had to apply twice
before she was accepted.

30:56.788 --> 30:58.358
The second time, the committee

30:58.390 --> 31:00.870
thought she showed
impressive growth in a year.

31:00.892 --> 31:04.362
There's no question,
her second canvas was brilliant.

31:04.396 --> 31:07.536
We even used it in our publicity materials.

31:07.566 --> 31:10.638
- We'd love to see it.
- Oh.

31:19.077 --> 31:21.751
And would you happen to know
where she got her BFA?

31:21.780 --> 31:23.691
I'll look it up.

31:26.451 --> 31:27.930
Her last year here

31:27.953 --> 31:31.662
she took "Art of Southeast Asia"
with Professor Gilsdorf,

31:31.690 --> 31:35.228
"Portraiture" with Professor Diniacopoulos--

31:35.260 --> 31:37.968
- This is odd.
- Eames: What?

31:37.996 --> 31:41.136
She got credit for her classes, but no grades.

31:41.166 --> 31:43.703
No grades? I wish I had
known about this place.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.147
Okay, I remember this.

31:46.171 --> 31:48.845
Ms. Moon was in residence that year,

31:48.874 --> 31:51.480
and her roommate, Zoe Payton, she suicided.

31:51.510 --> 31:55.549
So the college gave Sylvia a "bye."

31:55.580 --> 31:58.083
College policy. Because of the trauma.

31:58.116 --> 32:00.653
Do you remember how
the roommate killed herself?

32:02.053 --> 32:03.930
Hanged herself in her room.

32:07.559 --> 32:10.870
Zoe was our only child. Killed my wife.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.898
Just took 10 years to do it.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.673
Did you have any warning
Zoe might hurt herself?

32:15.700 --> 32:17.702
She'd keep things to herself,

32:17.736 --> 32:20.580
but she felt things very deep,
just like my wife.

32:20.605 --> 32:23.643
She'd broken up with some boy
a few weeks before.

32:23.675 --> 32:26.155
Did she ever mention
her roommate, Sylvia Moon?

32:26.178 --> 32:28.590
She found her, poor girl.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.116
Really broke her up. They were friends.

32:31.149 --> 32:32.628
Took art classes together

32:33.618 --> 32:35.256
This room hasn't changed much

32:35.287 --> 32:37.528
- since your daughter died, has it?
- No.

32:41.893 --> 32:43.895
Eames.

32:59.010 --> 33:00.512
What's the matter?

33:02.481 --> 33:04.483
Did Sylvia visit here?

33:04.516 --> 33:06.757
No, I don't think so.

33:06.785 --> 33:10.164
And this is one of your
daughter's paintings?

33:10.188 --> 33:12.134
She did that her freshman year.

33:12.157 --> 33:15.104
Same person did both paintings.

33:23.235 --> 33:25.442
She flipped the rope over the crossbeam--

33:25.470 --> 33:27.677
those acoustic tiles come out--

33:27.706 --> 33:30.312
and tied it to the radiator.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.322
The chair was kicked over right here.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.017
Was she tested for drugs?

33:34.045 --> 33:35.854
They found Quaaludes.

33:37.782 --> 33:39.728
Goren: Is this her bed here?

33:39.751 --> 33:43.324
Uh, yes. Think so.

33:46.224 --> 33:49.967
These tiles have been replaced.

33:49.995 --> 33:52.999
You have the maintenance
record for this room?

33:54.432 --> 33:56.173
Yep, a few years ago...

33:57.269 --> 33:59.681
Replaced a bent pipe and some broken brackets.

34:05.443 --> 34:07.650
Well, now I see it.

34:09.748 --> 34:13.355
- Joan, thank God. They arrested me.
- For what?

34:13.385 --> 34:15.364
- Carver: Tax fraud.
- Not this again.

34:15.387 --> 34:18.527
- Eames: She knew Bernard Jackson.
- Carver: Knew him quite well.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.333
You had a relationship with him
at the Art Institute.

34:21.359 --> 34:24.272
- No, I didn't --
- Carver: Don't even try denying it.

34:24.295 --> 34:27.038
Now as to the murders,

34:27.065 --> 34:29.272
we believe Mr. Langer committed them,

34:29.301 --> 34:31.907
but we need your help to prove it.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.940
I don't know. I wasn't there.

34:34.973 --> 34:38.476
We lifted over 120 different
fingerprints from the workshop.

34:38.510 --> 34:41.821
It won't take much to match
yours with one of those.

34:41.846 --> 34:43.848
She helps you, what does she get in return?

34:43.882 --> 34:46.385
She pleads to grand larceny two,
she gets probation,

34:46.418 --> 34:50.127
and we'll talk to the US Attorney
about the tax charges.

34:50.155 --> 34:54.159
That's if we get her full cooperation.

35:06.972 --> 35:09.714
Rudy asked me to...

35:09.741 --> 35:14.247
Help them talk to this woman, this curator.

35:14.279 --> 35:17.419
They said they were going to pay her off

35:17.449 --> 35:19.622
I stayed a half an hour.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.125
She was still alive when I left.

35:24.189 --> 35:28.069
When you left, where was Mrs. Ellis standing?

35:29.995 --> 35:33.875
- Near the table.
- Which table?

35:33.898 --> 35:36.640
One of them. I don't know which one.

35:36.668 --> 35:40.707
- Where was Mr. Langer?
- He was near the bookcase.

35:40.739 --> 35:44.050
At least four bookcases.

35:44.075 --> 35:46.817
I'm getting lost in the geography here.

35:49.114 --> 35:52.926
We're going to have to bring her
down to Jackson's loft to show us.

35:54.986 --> 35:58.695
Do I need to explain
what full cooperation means?

36:03.061 --> 36:05.302
She was standing right here.

36:07.966 --> 36:11.812
So just about two feet from
where she was hanged.

36:11.836 --> 36:14.248
You don't mind? I'm going to put this here.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.851
Was she drinking anything?

36:17.876 --> 36:20.186
She had a glass of wine.

36:20.211 --> 36:22.987
What half-full, almost empty?

36:23.014 --> 36:25.756
- Less than half-full.
- Eames: Who poured it for her?

36:25.784 --> 36:27.991
- Rudy.
- Goren: Who else had wine?

36:28.019 --> 36:31.660
- I did-- and Rudy.
- Jackson was where?

36:31.690 --> 36:35.035
There, next to that bookcase.

36:35.060 --> 36:38.371
- And Rudy?
- Leaning against that table.

36:42.767 --> 36:45.338
There was a bottle and a ring

36:45.370 --> 36:46.815
left by a glass.

36:51.242 --> 36:54.121
Then who was sitting in this chair?

36:54.145 --> 36:57.058
You see, we found two rings

36:57.082 --> 37:00.825
left by glasses on this table.

37:02.520 --> 37:05.296
Yeah, I'm thinking...

37:05.323 --> 37:08.566
Annie Ellis was feeling woozy

37:08.593 --> 37:10.971
from the knockout pills in her drink.

37:10.995 --> 37:13.908
- Mm-hm.
- She sat down

37:13.932 --> 37:16.173
and put her glass here.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.386
That leaves one glass unaccounted for.

37:27.979 --> 37:30.118
Rudy's glass was over by the bottle.

37:31.116 --> 37:33.392
So whose glass do you think--

37:33.418 --> 37:35.398
Maybe Jackson had a glass after I left.

37:35.420 --> 37:39.163
The Medical Examiner checked him for alcohol.
He didn't have anything to drink.

37:41.159 --> 37:43.070
Then that leaves only your glass.

37:43.094 --> 37:46.598
It's possible I could've
put my glass there when I left.

37:46.631 --> 37:50.010
Right next to Annie's. She was already
sitting in this chair when you left.

37:50.034 --> 37:52.105
No, she was standing right there.

37:52.137 --> 37:54.344
No way. Not with all the pills in her system.

37:54.372 --> 37:56.477
You said yourself her
drink was almost finished.

37:56.508 --> 38:00.149
If she had passed out and fallen down...

38:03.148 --> 38:06.391
There'd be bruises on her
and-- and broken glass.

38:06.417 --> 38:09.626
No, she was passed out
in this chair, wasn't she?

38:10.822 --> 38:13.063
I don't remember now.

38:17.195 --> 38:20.733
And the plan was what?
To kill her and dispose of her body?

38:20.765 --> 38:22.244
I don't know what they planned.

38:22.267 --> 38:24.770
But Jackson got cold feet.
Langer had to shoot him,

38:24.803 --> 38:26.373
and then he wiped gunpowder on Annie.

38:26.404 --> 38:27.781
I wouldn't know.

38:27.806 --> 38:31.618
And why did he drag Annie all the way
over there-- hang her from a rafter?

38:31.643 --> 38:35.250
There are perfectly good pipes
right above this chair.

38:37.582 --> 38:40.028
Strong looking pipes.

38:41.452 --> 38:44.160
Ah, what do you think?

38:48.927 --> 38:51.430
They strong enough to hold Annie's weight?

38:53.364 --> 38:55.776
I think she's told you everything she knows.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.711
I don't think so.

38:59.304 --> 39:01.215
I think she has experience

39:01.239 --> 39:03.446
in hanging things from pipes.

39:03.474 --> 39:05.351
Remember these pipes?

39:07.712 --> 39:11.683
You should, they were in your dorm room.

39:11.716 --> 39:14.458
Goren: How about it, Sylvia?

39:14.485 --> 39:17.364
You tried hanging something from these pipes,

39:17.388 --> 39:19.527
and they broke on you.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.473
You didn't want that happening again.

39:24.495 --> 39:26.941
It's not true.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.945
So you and Langer,

39:28.967 --> 39:30.571
you dragged Annie all the way over here.

39:30.602 --> 39:33.515
- You hanged her from this beam...
- No, I wasn't here then!

39:33.538 --> 39:35.518
...and tied the rope off at the radiator,

39:35.540 --> 39:38.248
just like you did Zoe Payton.

39:43.314 --> 39:46.386
Zoe committed suicide.

39:46.417 --> 39:49.057
You didn't kill her?

39:49.087 --> 39:53.934
- You didn't steal her painting?
- No, that was my painting.

39:53.958 --> 39:57.269
Your painting of her parents' living room?

39:57.295 --> 39:59.673
Yes. I've been there.

40:00.765 --> 40:04.110
Then what happened to you?

40:04.135 --> 40:07.981
How come they say that you
never lived up to your promise?

40:08.006 --> 40:10.987
I have. I've done great paintings.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.018
But they just didn't look like this.

40:18.516 --> 40:21.395
IS that it?

40:21.419 --> 40:24.696
Everybody just wanted you
to keep doing the same thing?

40:24.722 --> 40:26.599
They wouldn't give me a chance.

40:28.660 --> 40:31.197
But Rudy Langer did.

40:31.229 --> 40:33.402
He was giving you your own show...

40:33.431 --> 40:36.537
In return for knocking off

40:36.567 --> 40:38.171
a Monet, a Cezanne--

40:38.202 --> 40:41.445
- She already admitted to that.
- It was worth it.

40:41.472 --> 40:46.353
Your one chance to make them
see your vision...

40:47.812 --> 40:49.314
Your talent.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.728
Make them see you, right?

40:52.750 --> 40:54.752
That's all I needed.

40:56.587 --> 41:01.696
Then that stupid woman
from that stupid little museum

41:01.726 --> 41:03.399
was going to mess the whole thing up.

41:03.428 --> 41:06.034
- We were going to pay her off.
- She wouldn't take the money.

41:06.064 --> 41:09.568
She wanted to expose you as a fraud--

41:09.600 --> 41:13.844
as someone who made a living
off the work of dead artists.

41:13.871 --> 41:15.976
I told you, I left.

41:17.408 --> 41:20.446
Jackson wanted to let her go.

41:22.380 --> 41:26.294
This man who slept with you, used you...

41:27.318 --> 41:29.491
Was going to let her ruin you...

41:30.688 --> 41:33.100
- So you killed him!
- It was Rudy.

41:33.124 --> 41:35.764
- No, you shot him!
- Rudy did it. He knew where the gun was.

41:35.793 --> 41:37.830
He did it. I couldn't stop him.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.513
Goren: You were there.

41:51.609 --> 41:53.850
Oh my God.

41:58.683 --> 42:01.425
And then you helped him kill Annie.

42:08.426 --> 42:10.736
You don't know--

42:10.762 --> 42:13.265
you don't know what it's like.

42:15.433 --> 42:17.344
What, to work so hard?

42:17.368 --> 42:18.847
Yes.

42:19.837 --> 42:22.283
And still be a nobody.

42:25.443 --> 42:27.650
Yes.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.385
Welcome to the human race.

42:38.856 --> 42:41.496
Goren: Heir Langer...

42:41.526 --> 42:42.834
What is it now?

42:42.860 --> 42:45.534
Did you know there's
an original Salvador Dali

42:45.563 --> 42:48.407
hanging at Rikers Island?
He donated it in the '60s.

42:48.433 --> 42:49.844
That's fascinating.

42:49.867 --> 42:51.778
You're going to get to see it firsthand.

42:51.803 --> 42:53.646
You're under arrest for murder.

42:53.671 --> 42:55.548
That's impossible. You can't do this to me.

42:55.573 --> 42:56.916
We can and we just did.

42:56.941 --> 42:59.979
(speaking German)

43:14.358 --> 43:16.304
What was that all about?

43:16.327 --> 43:18.807
Told him he missed the boat
on Sylvia Moon.

43:18.830 --> 43:21.106
Now that she's an admitted killer,

43:21.132 --> 43:23.738
he could've made a fortune off her paintings.
