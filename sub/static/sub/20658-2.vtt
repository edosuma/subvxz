00:30.464 --> 00:32.433
No. No, I, um...

00:32.433 --> 00:33.534

00:33.534 --> 00:35.069
they're patting people down and

00:35.069 --> 00:35.769
we have to take our off shoes.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.037
So, it's all very, um,

00:37.037 --> 00:38.306
state-of-the-art, so I'm just

00:38.306 --> 00:40.274

They didn't stop the shoe

The increased number of

The heightened awareness of

01:52.045 --> 01:53.381
passengers like you and me.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.015
And intelligence agencies that

01:55.015 --> 01:56.550
work to stop attacks before they

01:56.550 --> 01:57.485
even happen.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.052

suck at screening.

02:10.664 --> 02:11.899
When the Department of Homeland

02:11.899 --> 02:13.734

02:13.734 --> 02:15.203
failed to find mock weapons

02:15.203 --> 02:18.306
and explosives 95% of the time.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.086
they confiscate to Instagram,

02:40.394 --> 02:41.061
Most of the stuff they

02:41.061 --> 02:42.696
confiscate is just novelty crap.

02:42.696 --> 02:43.931
No, look, that's a grenade.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.266
No, that's just a vape that's

02:45.266 --> 02:46.334
shaped like a grenade.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.568
How is that dangerous?

02:47.568 --> 02:49.237
That's a samurai sword.

02:49.237 --> 02:49.937
That's a weapon.

02:49.937 --> 02:50.838
No, those aren't weapons.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.406
Those are replica weapons.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.674
And their owner isn't a

02:53.674 --> 02:55.676
terrorist, he's a dweeb.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.177
And stop calling them samurai

02:57.177 --> 02:57.845
swords.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.680
It's a Master Sword replica from

02:59.680 --> 03:00.948
"The Legend of Zelda,"

03:00.948 --> 03:01.615
all right?

03:01.615 --> 03:03.183
Confiscating fake weapons and

03:03.183 --> 03:05.052
stopping people from just saying

03:05.052 --> 03:05.786
the word "bomb"--

03:05.786 --> 03:06.920
Don't say "bomb"!

Come on, man.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.357

Those things do nothing to

03:10.791 --> 03:12.092
stop terrorism.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.727
They just create the illusion

03:13.727 --> 03:14.595
of security.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.464
It's a concept called security

03:36.750 --> 03:38.319
Security theater is a show

03:38.319 --> 03:39.920
the agency puts on to make it

03:39.920 --> 03:40.821
look like they're doing a lot

03:40.821 --> 03:42.923
to protect us...

03:42.923 --> 03:44.825
Found another grenade vape!

03:44.825 --> 03:45.493

03:45.493 --> 03:47.160

03:47.160 --> 03:48.095

03:48.095 --> 03:48.762
What?

03:48.762 --> 03:49.463
Who's that?

03:49.463 --> 03:50.731
I was hoping you'd show up.

03:50.731 --> 03:51.799
That's Bruce Schneier.

03:51.799 --> 03:52.900
He's a renowned expert on

03:52.900 --> 03:53.734
security theater.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.168
Why is he a scooter?

03:55.168 --> 03:55.903
I'm broadcasting from a

03:55.936 --> 03:57.137
secure location.

03:57.137 --> 03:58.005
And I couldn't get through the

03:58.005 --> 03:58.839
metal detector.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.474
Anyway, as far as screening

04:00.474 --> 04:02.142
goes, what we had before

04:02.142 --> 04:03.511
September 11th is actually quite

04:03.511 --> 04:04.345
adequate.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.646
Taking your shoes off and

04:05.646 --> 04:06.647
putting your liquids in a

04:06.647 --> 04:08.181
separate bag doesn't actually

04:08.181 --> 04:09.082
make you safer.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.284
It just makes you feel safer.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.919
But if we feel safer, isn't

04:11.919 --> 04:13.020
that-- isn't that good?

04:13.020 --> 04:14.121
Well, first, the illusion of

04:14.121 --> 04:15.489
security isn't worth it if you

04:15.489 --> 04:16.524
have to give up essential

04:16.524 --> 04:17.691
freedoms and privacies

04:17.691 --> 04:18.359
to get it.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.026
Ooh!

04:19.026 --> 04:19.760
Hey, watch it!

04:19.760 --> 04:21.094
Stop clenching.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.463
And secondly, it's dangerous

04:22.463 --> 04:23.531
to present the illusion of

04:23.531 --> 04:24.965
security when the system is

04:24.965 --> 04:25.799
actually quite vulnerable to

04:25.799 --> 04:26.467
terrorist attacks.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.134
What?

04:27.134 --> 04:27.801
It is?

04:27.801 --> 04:28.869
Oh, yeah, even if this

04:28.869 --> 04:29.937
screening worked, it would only

04:29.937 --> 04:31.372
protect us against the last way

04:31.372 --> 04:32.272
we were attacked.

04:32.272 --> 04:32.940
It does nothing to stop

04:32.940 --> 04:33.941
terrorists from finding new ways

04:33.941 --> 04:35.676
to hurt us.

04:35.676 --> 04:36.844
The terrorists can see our

04:36.844 --> 04:37.711
security.

04:37.711 --> 04:38.979
They can figure out how to get

04:38.979 --> 04:39.713
around it.

04:39.713 --> 04:40.548
So instead of trying to make

04:40.548 --> 04:42.149
airports impregnable, we should

04:42.149 --> 04:43.216
take the money we're wasting on

04:43.216 --> 04:45.052
the TSA and spend it on things

04:45.052 --> 04:46.487
that work-- intelligence,

04:46.487 --> 04:48.121
investigation, and emergency

04:48.121 --> 04:48.889
response.

04:48.889 --> 04:49.823
Face it, Phil.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.625
The TSA does nothing but violate

04:51.625 --> 04:53.561
your privacy and waste your

04:53.561 --> 04:54.462

06:16.410 --> 06:17.377
What the hell?

06:17.377 --> 06:19.379
In 1982, seven people were

06:19.379 --> 06:21.048
killed from cyanide placed

06:21.048 --> 06:22.650
inside of Tylenol bottles.

06:22.650 --> 06:23.884
We don't know who did it and we

06:23.884 --> 06:25.586
don't know why they did it, but

06:25.586 --> 06:27.555
let's make the educated guess

06:27.555 --> 06:29.156
that it was a crazy person.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.991
I'm doing this for no reason!

06:30.991 --> 06:33.427
I make no sense!

06:33.427 --> 06:34.227
There were also a few

06:34.227 --> 06:36.263
copycats, which, that's kind of

06:36.263 --> 06:37.397
a weird phrase, isn't it, come

06:37.397 --> 06:38.065
to think of it?

06:38.065 --> 06:39.567
Like, who's ever seen a cat copy

06:39.567 --> 06:40.233
another cat?

06:40.233 --> 06:41.134
Hey, can we focus, please?

06:41.134 --> 06:44.004
There is a murderer with no

06:44.004 --> 06:45.405
motive, like, one aisle--

06:45.405 --> 06:46.674
That's terrifying.

06:46.674 --> 06:47.808
Yeah, it is.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.443
And that's why the world went

06:49.443 --> 06:51.612
nuts over this story, which left

06:51.612 --> 06:53.246
Tylenol with a wee bit of

06:53.246 --> 06:55.115
a PR problem.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.750
Gentlemen, and one tough lady

06:56.750 --> 06:57.585
who we don't respect because

06:57.585 --> 06:59.086
it's the early '80s, what do

06:59.086 --> 06:59.753
we do?

06:59.753 --> 07:00.921
Make people feel safe, sir.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.122
Make people feel safe, sir.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.290
Great idea, Brian.

07:03.290 --> 07:04.692
I love your male brain.

07:04.692 --> 07:07.160
Let us make people feel safe!

07:07.160 --> 07:08.428
And that's what they did.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.763
They yanked Tylenol off the

07:09.763 --> 07:11.164
shelves and a few months later

07:11.164 --> 07:12.099
introduced the world to the

07:12.099 --> 07:14.001
first tamper-resistant seal.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.335
The public was reassured,

07:15.335 --> 07:16.637
Tylenol sales completely

07:16.637 --> 07:18.038
rebounded, and every other

07:18.038 --> 07:19.673
medicine soon did the same.

07:19.673 --> 07:20.608
Phil?

07:20.608 --> 07:21.975
Phil?

07:21.975 --> 07:23.176
Phil?

07:23.176 --> 07:23.977
Hey!

07:23.977 --> 07:24.978
But the tamper-resistant

07:24.978 --> 07:27.147
seal is just more security

07:27.147 --> 07:27.815
theater.

07:27.815 --> 07:28.482
It is?

07:28.482 --> 07:29.149
Yeah.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.984
It may make you feel safer, but

07:30.984 --> 07:32.720
it doesn't actually protect you

07:32.720 --> 07:33.787
from murderers.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.454
Think about it.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.123
If a real whackadoo really

07:36.123 --> 07:37.357
wanted to hurt you, you think a

07:37.357 --> 07:38.859
little piece of plastic is gonna

07:38.859 --> 07:39.693
stop him?

07:39.693 --> 07:41.529
Hey, that's true!

07:41.529 --> 07:43.163
I could-- I could poke a syringe

07:43.163 --> 07:45.332
through the seal, or put contact

07:45.332 --> 07:46.466
poison on the outside of the

07:46.466 --> 07:49.302
bottle, or what if I broke into

07:49.302 --> 07:50.337
the factory?

07:50.337 --> 07:51.171
Stop!

07:51.171 --> 07:52.139
And why limit yourself

07:52.139 --> 07:53.073
to Tylenol?

07:53.073 --> 07:54.041
You could hurt people any number

07:54.041 --> 07:54.875
of ways.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.309
Yeah, yeah, like I could put

07:56.309 --> 07:58.078
rat poison in a salad bar.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.079
I could hide barbed wire

07:59.079 --> 07:59.813
in a sandbox.

07:59.813 --> 08:00.581
Oh, yeah, or-- I'm just

08:00.581 --> 08:01.649
spitballing here-- what if you

08:01.649 --> 08:03.684
put arsenic in a Super Soaker?

08:03.684 --> 08:04.351
Yeah.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.719
Ooh, okay, hi.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.420
I'm a lawyer from the network.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.589
We'd prefer if you didn't give

08:08.589 --> 08:10.223
crazy people ideas for how to

08:10.223 --> 08:12.359
kill, on the air.

08:12.359 --> 08:13.260
Fair point.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.662
Luckily, serial killers

08:14.662 --> 08:15.328
are rare.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.363
You don't really need to worry

08:16.363 --> 08:17.030
about them.

08:17.030 --> 08:17.931
Yeah, but he killed seven

08:17.931 --> 08:18.599
people.

08:18.599 --> 08:19.266
That's a lot.

08:19.266 --> 08:19.933
That's, like, all the

08:19.933 --> 08:20.768
Kardashians.

08:20.768 --> 08:21.935
Or half the Duggars.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.503
But while we were focused on one

08:23.503 --> 08:25.205
fluke incident, we ignored the

08:25.205 --> 08:27.741
hard truth that 150 people die

08:27.741 --> 08:29.442
every year from what's in these

08:29.442 --> 08:30.177
bottles.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.344
Asbestos?

08:31.344 --> 08:32.079
BPAs?

08:32.079 --> 08:33.346
(gasps) Little bugs?

08:33.346 --> 08:35.415
No, the pills.

08:35.415 --> 08:36.684
The pills, that's crazy.

08:36.684 --> 08:37.350
I know.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.919
Because for years, Tylenol was

08:38.919 --> 08:40.420
advertised as if it were one of

08:40.420 --> 08:42.189
the safest drugs on the market.

08:42.189 --> 08:45.726
♪♪

08:45.726 --> 08:47.127
Bobby has a fever.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.095
Should I give him aspirin?

08:48.095 --> 08:50.063
I'm a doctor, and Tylenol is

08:50.063 --> 08:51.364
the number-one pain reliever

08:51.364 --> 08:52.365
more doctors give their

08:52.365 --> 08:53.533
own kids.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.702
Aw, don't you feel safe

08:54.702 --> 08:55.402
and warm?

08:55.402 --> 08:56.604
Aah, stranger danger!

08:56.604 --> 08:57.605
Don't worry, kid.

08:57.605 --> 08:58.772
Statistically, you're far more

08:58.772 --> 09:00.140
likely to be hurt by a family

09:00.140 --> 09:01.875
member than a stranger, so...

09:01.875 --> 09:03.143
Why are you here?

09:03.143 --> 09:04.377
To save your son.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.446
Tylenol has an incredibly narrow

09:06.446 --> 09:07.247
safety margin.

09:07.247 --> 09:07.915
Ooh.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.549
The company says that this is

09:09.549 --> 09:11.885
a safe daily dose of Tylenol,

09:11.885 --> 09:13.821
but the FDA says that this is

09:13.821 --> 09:15.756
a dangerous daily dose.

09:15.756 --> 09:16.924
That's only four more pills.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.225
I pop that many at dinner.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.226
Yeah, well, you really

09:19.226 --> 09:19.993
shouldn't.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.061
Acetaminophen, the active

09:21.061 --> 09:22.495
ingredient in Tylenol, is the

09:22.495 --> 09:24.431
number-one cause of acute liver

09:24.431 --> 09:25.966
failure in America.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.567
In one year alone, it sent as

09:27.567 --> 09:29.803
many as 78,000 people to

09:29.803 --> 09:30.604
the hospital.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.005
Oh, my God, why would you lie

09:32.005 --> 09:32.673
to us?

09:32.673 --> 09:34.107
I'm just an actor.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.409
In fact, perhaps you recognize

09:36.409 --> 09:38.511
me from earlier.

09:38.511 --> 09:39.579
Maybe all those Tylenol

09:39.579 --> 09:40.513
commercials should have gone

09:40.513 --> 09:42.983
a little more like this.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.117
Bobby has a fever.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.452
Should I give him aspirin?

09:45.452 --> 09:46.119
I'm a doctor.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.154
Give him Tylenol.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.588
But be very careful.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.123
It's one of the most dangerous

09:50.123 --> 09:51.424
over-the-counter pain relievers

09:51.424 --> 09:52.092
available.

09:52.092 --> 09:52.960
Tylenol.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.994
Use as directed,

09:53.994 --> 09:57.965
or else. (echoing)

09:57.965 --> 09:59.166
My God, how--

09:59.166 --> 10:00.300
how is that legal?

10:00.300 --> 10:01.468
A lot of doctors don't think

10:01.468 --> 10:02.435
it should be.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.070
The medical journal,

10:03.103 --> 10:04.271
"The Lancet," said that if the

10:04.271 --> 10:05.806
drug were discovered today, it

10:05.806 --> 10:07.540
would never be freely available

10:07.540 --> 10:09.643
without a prescription.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.945
Well, I'm sure the FDA

10:11.945 --> 10:12.612
is on it.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.981
Yeah, 30 years late.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.650
That quote was from 1975.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.018
But the FDA didn't even require

10:18.018 --> 10:19.119
them to put a warning label on

10:19.119 --> 10:21.388
the bottle until 2009.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.222
(static)

10:22.222 --> 10:24.124
And even that wasn't enough.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.392
This is Dr. Sidney Wolfe,

10:25.392 --> 10:26.960
a physician and co-founder of

10:26.960 --> 10:27.828
Public Citizen's

10:27.861 --> 10:29.062
Health Research Group.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.463
Not only is acetaminophen the

10:30.463 --> 10:31.832
leading cause of acute liver

10:31.832 --> 10:33.834
failure, but it exceeds all

10:33.867 --> 10:35.568
other causes combined.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.204
I served on an FDA advisory

10:37.204 --> 10:38.806
committee that voted

10:38.806 --> 10:40.908
overwhelmingly to lower the

10:40.908 --> 10:43.076
maximum non-prescription dose of

10:43.076 --> 10:45.312
acetaminophen, but for the past

10:45.312 --> 10:47.480
six years, the FDA leadership

10:47.480 --> 10:49.316
has effectively ignored our

10:49.316 --> 10:50.550
important recommendation.

10:50.550 --> 10:51.218
What?

10:51.218 --> 10:53.253
The FDA has essentially

10:53.253 --> 10:55.255
failed to protect people from

10:55.255 --> 10:58.591
preventable liver toxicity.

10:58.591 --> 10:59.927
Excuse me.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.829
Is there a cave somewhere I can

11:01.829 --> 11:02.595
crawl into?

11:02.595 --> 11:04.231
No, but there is a damp

11:04.231 --> 11:06.934
bridge in the back.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.068
Look, the point is,

11:08.068 --> 11:09.837
sometimes we overreact to a

11:09.837 --> 11:12.172
small problem while ignoring

11:12.172 --> 11:13.106
the bigger one.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.674
That's the problem with security

11:14.674 --> 11:15.342
theater.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.676
Did someone say "theater"?

11:16.676 --> 11:17.344
(clears throat)

11:17.344 --> 11:19.079
Betty Botta bought some butter.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.347
Around the rugged rocks the

11:20.347 --> 11:21.414
ragged rascals ran.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.082
We're good, man.

11:22.082 --> 11:22.850
Yeah?

11:22.850 --> 11:24.217
All right.

11:24.217 --> 11:24.918
Whatever.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.019
Can I please get a bottle

11:26.019 --> 11:26.686
of aspirin?

11:26.686 --> 11:27.687
Oh, get the generic.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.856
It's exactly the same, but much

11:28.856 --> 11:29.689
cheaper.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.891
Whatever.

11:30.891 --> 11:31.959
I just need you to sign this.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.626
Great.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.228
Ah, my signature.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.030
That way, no one can steal my--

11:37.030 --> 11:37.765
What?

11:37.765 --> 11:39.099
What?

11:39.099 --> 11:39.867
Please tell me you don't have

11:39.867 --> 11:41.034
something against signatures.

11:41.034 --> 11:41.902
Actually, I do.

11:41.902 --> 11:42.870
Come on.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.037
If my wife is watching this,

11:44.037 --> 11:44.938
please know I love you!

11:48.075 --> 11:49.476
Let's see, I'll get this

11:49.476 --> 11:52.980
drone, and this GoPro, and this

11:52.980 --> 11:55.448
toy dog that does backflips.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.817
Man, you carry a lot

11:56.817 --> 11:57.484
of stuff.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.318
Put it on this.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.486
Hey.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.587
Excuse me.

12:00.587 --> 12:01.321
That's my credit card.

12:01.321 --> 12:01.989
You can't sign for

12:01.989 --> 12:02.823
my credit card.

12:02.823 --> 12:03.590
Yes, I can.

12:03.590 --> 12:04.591
I'm committing fraud.

12:04.591 --> 12:05.826
Here.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.896
"I am a fraud man."

12:08.896 --> 12:10.163
The bank is gonna know that's

12:10.163 --> 12:11.331
not my signature.

12:11.331 --> 12:11.999
No.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.133
It doesn't work that way.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.267
Here's what you think happens

12:14.267 --> 12:15.635
when you sign a receipt.

12:15.635 --> 12:16.937
According to my 30 years of

12:16.937 --> 12:18.005
handwriting expertise and

12:18.005 --> 12:19.472
intimate knowledge of Phil,

12:19.472 --> 12:20.941
I don't believe this is the way

12:20.941 --> 12:23.676
he dots his "I"s!

12:23.676 --> 12:25.012
Shut down the account!

12:25.012 --> 12:26.479
(siren blaring)

12:26.479 --> 12:27.915
It's all for you, buddy.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.316
It's all for you.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.851
And here's what actually

12:30.851 --> 12:31.584
happens.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.922
(store music playing)

12:34.922 --> 12:35.588
Nothing happened.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.090
Yeah, nothing happens.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.358
No one ever compares your

12:38.358 --> 12:39.526
signature on the receipt to the

12:39.526 --> 12:40.193
real one.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.195
It's more security theater.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.496
Yeah, but then what secures

12:43.496 --> 12:44.264
my credit card?

12:44.264 --> 12:45.198
Nothing, again.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.034
Oh, you might not know this.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.435
The credit card system is a

12:48.435 --> 12:49.769
pre-Internet relic with

12:49.769 --> 12:51.538
virtually no built-in security.

12:51.538 --> 12:52.205
Oh.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.706
Back in the '50s, a retailer

12:53.706 --> 12:55.208
would just copy down your number

12:55.208 --> 12:57.210
and phone it into the bank.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.711
The credit card number is

12:58.711 --> 12:59.512
four!

12:59.512 --> 13:00.280
Two!

13:00.280 --> 13:00.981
Fiver!

13:00.981 --> 13:01.815
Zero!

13:01.815 --> 13:03.350
Yeah, but things are way more

13:03.350 --> 13:04.051
advanced now.

13:04.051 --> 13:04.717
Yeah.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.319
Now a machine copies down your

13:06.319 --> 13:08.188
number and sends it to the bank.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.556
(energy shimmering)

13:09.556 --> 13:13.026
Aah!

13:13.026 --> 13:13.894
(computer voice) Welcome to

13:13.894 --> 13:15.062
the Internet.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.629
The truth is, all a thief

13:16.629 --> 13:17.865
needs to purchase something as

13:17.865 --> 13:20.133
you is this string of numbers.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.201
What-- No!

13:21.201 --> 13:22.069
Hey, that is private

13:22.069 --> 13:22.735
information!

13:22.735 --> 13:23.403
No, it isn't.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.071
It's one of the most public

13:24.071 --> 13:24.905
facts about you.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.373
You give it out every time you

13:26.373 --> 13:27.340
buy something.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.341
That's a real credit card number

13:28.341 --> 13:29.009
by the way.

13:29.009 --> 13:29.910
It's probably maxed out by now,

13:29.910 --> 13:30.743
but give it a shot.

13:30.743 --> 13:31.511
Don't.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.679
And in the Internet age, it

13:32.679 --> 13:34.848
is impossible to keep a single

13:34.848 --> 13:36.416
16-digit number a secret.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.384
But how does it get on

13:37.384 --> 13:38.051
the Internet?

13:38.051 --> 13:38.919
Any number of ways.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.220
A cashier could just write it

13:40.220 --> 13:41.354
down, it could be phished from

13:41.354 --> 13:42.755
an e-mail, it could be hacked

13:42.755 --> 13:43.823
from a vendor like Target or

13:43.823 --> 13:44.691
Wal-Mart.

13:44.691 --> 13:45.825
A card skimmer could harvest it

13:45.825 --> 13:46.927
from an ATM.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.428
A sneaky teen could snap a pic

13:48.428 --> 13:49.262
with a selfie stick.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.931
An NSA satellite could spy on

13:50.931 --> 13:51.865
you while you buy shaved ice at

13:51.865 --> 13:52.532
the beach.

13:52.532 --> 13:53.934
Ooh, a clever zoo monkey could

13:53.934 --> 13:54.601
peek at you while you--

13:54.601 --> 13:55.402
Okay, enough, enough.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.703
I get it.

13:56.703 --> 13:57.938
The fact is, if you have a

13:57.938 --> 13:59.272
credit card, you should just

13:59.272 --> 14:00.340
assume the number's already

14:00.340 --> 14:01.274
been stolen.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.742
In fact, there are so many

14:02.742 --> 14:04.011
numbers out here in the big

14:04.011 --> 14:05.445
Internet sea that getting

14:05.445 --> 14:07.014
defrauded just means your number

14:07.014 --> 14:08.781
was randomly chosen from a pile

14:08.781 --> 14:09.782
of millions.

14:09.782 --> 14:10.951
It's like an awful reverse

14:10.951 --> 14:11.784
lottery.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.887
Ugh, it's expired.

14:13.887 --> 14:14.621
Maxed out.

14:14.621 --> 14:15.455
Oh!

14:15.455 --> 14:16.957
Frequent flier miles.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.959
(laughs) There's a fresh one.

14:18.959 --> 14:19.759
Time to buy that new

14:19.759 --> 14:20.793
Bruce Schneier book.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.395
Very interested in security

14:22.395 --> 14:23.063
theater.

14:23.063 --> 14:23.730
No!

14:23.730 --> 14:24.397
That fisherman is using my

14:24.397 --> 14:25.398
credit card to purchase relevant

14:25.398 --> 14:26.266
nonfiction!

14:26.266 --> 14:26.967
What do I do?

14:26.967 --> 14:27.800
Nothing.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.635
Credit card fraud is so

14:28.635 --> 14:29.970
pervasive, banks have started

14:29.970 --> 14:31.638
just covering the charges so

14:31.638 --> 14:32.639
people don't freak out and

14:32.639 --> 14:33.473
cancel their cards.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.307
No, no.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.143
There is nothing that you can

14:36.143 --> 14:38.545
personally do to stop credit

14:38.545 --> 14:39.712
card theft.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.647
Nothing?

14:40.647 --> 14:41.648
Nothing.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.716
You know, I am having a very

14:43.716 --> 14:45.318
difficult time believing you.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.053
All right, let's talk to

14:46.053 --> 14:47.254
someone you might believe.

14:47.254 --> 14:51.224
(energy shimmering)

14:51.224 --> 14:51.925
Aah!

14:51.925 --> 14:53.160
Oh, hey, Kevin.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.494
Phil, this is Kevin Poulsen,

14:54.494 --> 14:55.562
journalist, author of the book

14:55.562 --> 14:57.130
"Kingpin," and an expert on

14:57.130 --> 14:57.998
computer crime.

14:57.998 --> 14:58.898
Adam, I'm kind of in the

14:58.898 --> 14:59.799
middle of a story right now.

14:59.799 --> 15:00.467
Yeah, but you can take a

15:00.467 --> 15:01.134
second to tell Phil about

15:01.134 --> 15:01.801
credit card fraud.

15:01.801 --> 15:02.469
No, no, I'm not saved!

15:02.469 --> 15:03.136
Come on, come on, just--

15:03.136 --> 15:03.770
Here you go, come on, just

15:03.803 --> 15:04.504
tell him.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.138
All right.

15:05.138 --> 15:05.838
Phil, the truth is, there are so

15:05.838 --> 15:07.174
many stolen credit card numbers

15:07.174 --> 15:08.408
out there that thieves are

15:08.408 --> 15:09.309
buying and selling them as

15:09.342 --> 15:10.177
commodities.

15:10.177 --> 15:11.011
Can you show us where

15:11.011 --> 15:11.678
that happens?

15:11.678 --> 15:12.345
Sure.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.513
So here's a website where you

15:13.513 --> 15:15.182
can buy credit card numbers for

15:15.182 --> 15:16.683
around $5 apiece.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.251
Crooks buy these by the tens, by

15:18.251 --> 15:19.619
the hundreds, and this isn't

15:19.619 --> 15:20.753
even a Dark Web site.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.989
This is a website that anybody

15:21.989 --> 15:22.855
could easily search for

15:22.855 --> 15:23.523
and find.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.092
It's grade school level stuff.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.126
Okay.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.494
So what-- what can I do?

15:27.494 --> 15:28.161
Nothing.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.496
It's a systemic problem.

15:29.496 --> 15:30.863
Credit card numbers are static

15:30.863 --> 15:32.199
and unchanging.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.766
Good security is dynamic and it

15:33.766 --> 15:34.834
changes every time.

15:34.834 --> 15:35.969
Is there, any, like,

15:35.969 --> 15:37.370
technological solution to this?

15:37.370 --> 15:38.038
In Europe, they have

15:38.038 --> 15:39.206
something called chip and PIN,

15:39.206 --> 15:40.840
or chip and signature, and this

15:40.840 --> 15:42.275
is a much more secure way of--

15:42.275 --> 15:43.210
of handling credit card

15:43.210 --> 15:44.211
transactions.

15:44.211 --> 15:45.645
It's only just now coming to the

15:45.645 --> 15:47.047
United States, which means for

15:47.047 --> 15:48.648
the next few years, we're still

15:48.648 --> 15:49.849
gonna be vulnerable.

15:49.849 --> 15:50.550
Thanks, Kevin!

15:50.550 --> 15:51.218
No! Aah!

15:51.218 --> 15:51.884
Whoa!

15:51.884 --> 15:52.685
(energy shimmering, popping)

15:55.055 --> 15:58.325
♪♪

15:58.358 --> 15:59.726
(energy shimmering)

15:59.726 --> 16:01.894
(both) Aah!

16:01.894 --> 16:03.730
Look, this is all a long way

16:03.730 --> 16:05.232
of saying that signatures on

16:05.232 --> 16:06.733
credit card receipts are just

16:06.733 --> 16:07.867
another form of security

16:07.867 --> 16:08.535
theater.

16:08.535 --> 16:09.969
Hackers already have your credit

16:09.969 --> 16:11.571
card number, and there's nothing

16:11.571 --> 16:12.405
you can do to stop 'em.

16:12.405 --> 16:16.543
(chuckles)

16:16.543 --> 16:19.179
I have tried very hard to

16:19.179 --> 16:21.714
keep my composure today.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.083
But I'm so close to crying

16:23.083 --> 16:24.917
right now.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.886
Does nothing keep me safe?

16:26.886 --> 16:28.855
Oh, yeah, there is one thing.

16:28.855 --> 16:29.522
What?

16:29.522 --> 16:30.357
What is it?

16:30.357 --> 16:31.024
Tell me what can--

16:31.024 --> 16:31.691
Well, I--

16:31.691 --> 16:32.359
Oh, this is my neighborhood.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.926
(gasps) Oh, that's my house!

16:33.926 --> 16:34.594
Yeah.

16:34.594 --> 16:35.395
It's my house!

16:35.395 --> 16:37.930
Yeah, yeah.

16:37.930 --> 16:38.865
Hey!

16:38.865 --> 16:40.267
You guys live here, too?

16:40.267 --> 16:41.068
Oh, my gosh!

16:41.068 --> 16:42.369
Hey!

16:42.369 --> 16:43.170
It's the TSA agent.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.437
I know that.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.272
From the airport.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.706
No!

16:50.009 --> 16:50.677
Phil, you're home!

16:50.677 --> 16:51.344
Oh! Oh!

16:51.344 --> 16:52.279
Are you okay?

16:52.279 --> 16:52.945
No!

16:52.945 --> 16:54.114
No, I'm not okay!

16:54.114 --> 16:55.248
I'm not okay!

16:55.248 --> 16:56.949
This man is terrifying!

16:56.949 --> 16:58.785
He got me detained by the TSA,

16:58.785 --> 17:00.220
he told me that Tylenol is gonna

17:00.220 --> 17:00.887
kill me.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.389
He put our credit card number on

17:02.389 --> 17:04.224
his television show.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.025
Eh, look, everything is theater,

17:06.025 --> 17:07.294
nothing is secure.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.296
So no, I'm not okay.

17:09.296 --> 17:10.363
Phil, you're missing

17:10.363 --> 17:11.198
the point.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.632
You and your family have nothing

17:12.632 --> 17:15.735
to worry about.

17:15.735 --> 17:18.205
What?

17:18.205 --> 17:20.140
Slow down.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.375
Look, we have weak, imperfect

17:22.375 --> 17:24.244
security everywhere in life.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.645
And it's totally fine.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.147
Like, I'll give you one example.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.881
That padlock right there?

17:28.881 --> 17:30.817
Locks like that are insanely

17:30.817 --> 17:31.551
easy to pick.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.819
You could take a class, learn

17:32.819 --> 17:33.920
how to do it in a day.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.322
Yeah, but, like, who cares?

17:35.322 --> 17:36.456
All that's in there are some old

17:36.456 --> 17:37.890
hoses and your Beanie Baby

17:37.890 --> 17:38.658
collection.

17:38.658 --> 17:39.559
Yeah.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.493
Yeah, who cares?

17:40.493 --> 17:41.628
Yeah, exactly.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.230
You know that no one's gonna go

17:43.230 --> 17:44.164
through the effort to get into

17:44.164 --> 17:45.332
your old shed, so you don't have

17:45.332 --> 17:46.999
to stress out about making it

17:46.999 --> 17:48.268
perfectly safe.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.336
You can take that off of

17:49.336 --> 17:50.803
yourself.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.071
That means you trust other

17:52.071 --> 17:53.072
people, Phil.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.174
And trusting people is an

17:54.174 --> 17:55.808
essential part of security,

17:55.808 --> 17:56.809
because it's how you make an

17:56.809 --> 17:58.111
accurate assessment of

17:58.111 --> 17:59.279
the real risks.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.749
You are smart, scooter man.

18:02.749 --> 18:03.850
Thanks.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.185
We're fortunate to live in

18:05.185 --> 18:06.653
a pretty safe country.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.020
And we make it safer when we

18:08.020 --> 18:09.456
build our security systems

18:09.456 --> 18:11.658
