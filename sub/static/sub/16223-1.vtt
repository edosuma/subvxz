00:18.809 --> 00:24.059
Repacked Subtitle by Pil0uFace for Yifi BRRIP release

00:24.037 --> 00:27.950
You put us like a fool, huh?

00:28.079 --> 00:30.700
You did not think we would see
, eh, Boyd?

00:30.709 --> 00:33.200
You make people want to laugh, Boyd?

00:38.200 --> 00:40.950
See?
That is funny.

01:05.244 --> 01:11.920
You're late again.
- I know. Is he mad?

01:12.045 --> 01:15.110
Glad he is not.

01:15.846 --> 01:19.800
Please sheriff. As always.
- Thank you, Al.

01:19.929 --> 01:24.267
That looks good. For me one
with a ball and chocolate sprinkles.

01:24.389 --> 01:29.200
Easy, cowboy. We are still
service. Give him a sorbet.

01:29.209 --> 01:32.830
Coming.
Keep our city safe keeping, eh.

01:33.609 --> 01:36.600
Hello, laatkomertje.

01:38.019 --> 01:42.259
When they told me that just released
crazy not to believe, I ignored them.

01:42.359 --> 01:45.011
I appreciate that, sir.
- Put me not to embarrass, Boyd.

01:45.111 --> 01:47.291
Yes, sir.
Sorry.

01:48.419 --> 01:52.462
If you would set your alarm for once,
you would not get that drivel.

01:57.939 --> 02:02.928
Yours are tastier, Kenny.
- Thank you, Sheriff.

02:03.059 --> 02:07.651
What do you say, Irv?
- I live just my dream, Sheriff.

02:07.779 --> 02:12.531
today I'm going with your mother
along with some exotic oils.

02:12.656 --> 02:17.170
Maybe then it depends
a eucalyptus scent.

02:17.297 --> 02:20.970
Boyd, come here in your party uniform.
You have a birthday do.

02:20.978 --> 02:22.490
It is someone's big day, huh?

02:22.618 --> 02:26.810
Yes, Marty Prichard, 34. Great news.
The whole world celebrates it.

02:27.659 --> 02:33.760
Marty Prichard?
Yes, that is good for you?

02:33.909 --> 02:36.460
Yes.
- Then a little further.

02:50.789 --> 02:54.936
Can I have an ice cream, please?
- But of course.

03:02.989 --> 03:07.377
Enjoy your delicious scoop.
- Thank you.

03:08.149 --> 03:11.901
I think he has not understood it.
What do you think?

03:16.189 --> 03:19.339
Now he will be afraid.

03:27.389 --> 03:34.140
What do you recommend?
- Banaanza The chocolate is really nice.

03:34.271 --> 03:38.740
Banaanza?
- Like Bonanza, but banana... Thu.

03:38.871 --> 03:43.540
That is ridiculous.
- This flavor is gluten-free...

03:43.672 --> 03:48.820
but there can still nuts in it.
Do not take it there if you're allergic to.

03:49.433 --> 03:52.291
I'm not allergic to nuts.
- Then that's probably something for you.

03:52.391 --> 03:55.130
Unless you want to taste Raisins
Perk.

03:57.155 --> 04:00.900
I give you each a spoon.

04:02.319 --> 04:05.865
Thank you.

04:05.999 --> 04:10.434
Ken
- Stephanie. Thank you.

04:15.039 --> 04:20.317
Kenny Boyd. How are you, friend?
Nice to see that you've accomplished something.

04:20.439 --> 04:26.350
Look at yourself sometimes.
- Hi, sweetie.

04:26.480 --> 04:30.470
Have you seen Kenny Boyd?
- Hi, Kenny.

04:30.609 --> 04:35.960
This is a great party, honey.
Come. Kenny Boyd.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.520
Leave me alone.

04:54.889 --> 04:57.797
Need an aspirin?
I have a splitting headache.

04:57.929 --> 05:02.235
I always carry it with me so
you don't need to aks (axe)

05:02.689 --> 05:08.796
This was no accident.
- This is guy's going to heaven.

05:08.929 --> 05:12.841
the ax.
- What are you doing?

05:12.969 --> 05:19.568
Did not we  puns?
- Why would we do that?

05:19.689 --> 05:25.360
That guy was after his birthday
dumped in his yard with an ax in his head.

05:26.010 --> 05:31.840
Our guy knew his victim.
And he hated him too.

05:31.971 --> 05:36.920
Why would someone pour gasoline
over a corpse and not burn?

05:38.373 --> 05:41.330
So we would find.

05:41.453 --> 05:47.050
The coroner found these two cards
in his mouth. What do you think, boss?

06:04.697 --> 06:07.970
I would not know.

06:08.098 --> 06:10.210
That would be my ex with ax shelf
done.

06:10.218 --> 06:12.751
Good pun.

06:19.260 --> 06:24.699
How was your day?
- Good.

06:25.821 --> 06:30.213
34 years and all I get is good.

06:30.342 --> 06:36.657
Not now, Mom.
- Another thing you said if you're irritated.

06:36.783 --> 06:43.576
'Good' and 'not now'.

07:15.630 --> 07:22.423
Marty had his vices, but he was
far as I know, not a gambler.

07:22.551 --> 07:26.625
He had no money?
- I think not.

07:26.752 --> 07:32.430
That should be fun.
- I do not like to talk about, but...

07:32.553 --> 07:36.663
Marty had a lot of girlfriends.

07:37.114 --> 07:44.351
When he came home that night,
I thought he was such a bitch to Sat

07:44.475 --> 07:47.308
Sluts?

07:49.316 --> 07:54.870
this guy? Really?
- Can I be honest, Sheriff?

07:54.871 --> 07:56.371
course.

07:56.637 --> 08:02.952
Marty I have not killed,
but I do not mind that he is dead.

08:03.078 --> 08:06.628
Am I therefore a bad person?

08:07.759 --> 08:11.275
No.
course not.

08:19.801 --> 08:25.274
Boyd, you move into your new house?

08:26.442 --> 08:31.871
Would not you be in a madhouse where you sit
own shit eats?

08:38.525 --> 08:41.756
You put us like a fool, huh?

08:41.758 --> 08:43.258
No?

08:43.804 --> 08:47.162
There seems to be different?

08:48.206 --> 08:54.316
I will give you even embarrass you.
How about that?

08:55.127 --> 08:59.519
Hold him.

08:59.648 --> 09:03.688
He shakes.
He is afraid.

09:03.809 --> 09:06.722
For example, the. Cut into him.
Let him bleed.

09:09.410 --> 09:12.960
Keep him quiet.
What do you like that, asshole?

09:17.892 --> 09:21.282
Boyd, you have the street.

09:21.412 --> 09:25.770
And last,
cover that, will you? That's disgusting.

09:28.573 --> 09:32.806
?
He's right. They are not pretty.

09:41.536 --> 09:44.050
Take care, buddy.

09:53.738 --> 09:58.051
Thank you.
- Anytime. Is it?

09:58.179 --> 10:02.889
My back...

10:04.740 --> 10:10.179
Thank you.
- No problem. Later.

10:13.821 --> 10:16.939
Before there was Ronald,
if I do you play basketball.

10:17.062 --> 10:22.137
Ronald gave me the errors
them see that you and I were in our lives.

10:22.263 --> 10:29.022
He and I now think the time you put
in sports, you now can spend Bible.

10:30.184 --> 10:32.677
Shall we?
Jesus hates latecomers.

10:32.678 --> 10:35.177
ugly sweaters But apparently not.

10:35.545 --> 10:40.904
Lord, please send someone who
child on the right path can bring. Amen.

10:41.906 --> 10:45.582
I do not like how it appeals to me.
- I'll talk to her.

10:46.867 --> 10:49.860
whom also He sent, hopefully he
pizza with him. I'm starved.

11:10.671 --> 11:16.543
Indeed. Do not let anyone see it.
Keep it all for yourself.

11:31.755 --> 11:36.750
That was I can tackle.
- And come out of your shell?

11:36.876 --> 11:41.393
What kind of mother would I be if I would allow
?

11:47.638 --> 11:51.473
The doctor said that 70% again
wants to commit suicide.

11:51.599 --> 11:56.515
yourself from side to make
that you have to earn.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.765
Love, Dad.

13:22.895 --> 13:25.329
later.

13:33.417 --> 13:38.446
I found Tammy's dress
simply inappropriate for a church.

13:38.578 --> 13:42.332
This music box was yours, you had said.
- Amy, you made us scared.

13:42.458 --> 13:47.772
my music box is on the bottom
something engraved. "Love, Dad".

13:47.899 --> 13:50.858
knew that you probably not, huh?

13:50.980 --> 13:54.860
I put some chamomile tea.

14:09.783 --> 14:15.142
When I met him, he had
in the hospital because of depression.

14:17.705 --> 14:21.254
He was a mistake in my life
that I wanted to leave behind me.

14:21.385 --> 14:25.982
And you did not think about what I want?
- It was the best. He's crazy.

14:26.106 --> 14:30.817
eleven years I thought my father had gone through its
.

14:30.947 --> 14:34.304
I know you're upset.
- You think?

14:36.908 --> 14:40.026
Do you know where he is?

14:41.069 --> 14:44.301
What does the Lord lie about, Mom?
What is his position on this?

14:46.550 --> 14:49.508
I think he lives in Green Oaks.

14:52.711 --> 14:55.862
What's his name?
- Amy, please.

14:55.991 --> 14:58.904
What is my father?

15:32.758 --> 15:38.072
Hey, asshole.
You owe me 100.

15:39.119 --> 15:43.716
You said I could not go away.
That I was not good in my head.

15:43.840 --> 15:47.993
Guess gay.
I have just done.

15:48.961 --> 15:55.720
Shut up. I gotta go.
Sure but you have my money.

15:56.362 --> 15:58.398
Bitch.

15:59.203 --> 16:04.562
I hope you're high
of something better than what I smoke.

16:06.644 --> 16:10.081
What's this?

16:12.605 --> 16:14.405
What's this?

16:16.606 --> 16:19.404
I am not come to see a movie.

17:07.855 --> 17:11.856
What you got for me, Ernie?
- Another corpse. One Wade Hutchinson.

17:12.015 --> 17:15.214
Need a box for me?
- No, I...

17:15.214 --> 17:16.714
Thank you.

17:17.256 --> 17:22.729
Are there witnesses?
- No. According to the manager there is no way.

17:22.857 --> 17:26.931
It wasn'ta robbery.
Wade had more than 200 dollars.

17:27.058 --> 17:30.632
It has no head.
Most seem to have a head.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.129
Where is his head?
- No idea.

17:33.229 --> 17:36.129
That we are left to go and search.
- Good idea, sir.

17:36.260 --> 17:40.857
You just do not cut someone's head off
unless you are very angry.

17:45.982 --> 17:50.180
I found the head, sir.
- Bring it here.

18:01.864 --> 18:05.335
See?
That's funny?

18:06.585 --> 18:09.976
You have deserved.

18:14.227 --> 18:20.747
Agent Dotkins. Sheriff, a journalist of the Gazet
is on line one.

18:28.909 --> 18:31.185
Hello.

18:32.550 --> 18:37.750
say we still do not meet the press?
- You heard him. No press, no panic.

18:38.791 --> 18:44.503
We find that bastard, Ernie.
We skinned him.

18:44.632 --> 18:48.421
And we go his own skin
bear.

18:56.794 --> 19:01.710
We have yesterday a second corpse found.
- Really?

19:01.835 --> 19:08.833
Wade Hutchinson Did you know?
- You were at school together, right?

19:09.876 --> 19:16.032
He says yes.
- Someone him harshly.

19:16.157 --> 19:21.027
Beheaded.
A dirty affair.

19:22.879 --> 19:30.798
Give me a break. Keep it quiet because if this
convenience, we have some experience.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.719
course, Sheriff.

19:37.681 --> 19:40.560
I've had enough.

19:45.643 --> 19:50.399
A good kid.
Though he is not exactly charismatic.

19:51.884 --> 19:57.357
He beheaded him with one blow.
At one time off with a machete.

19:57.485 --> 20:02.276
Or with a samurai sword .
That would be cool.

20:02.406 --> 20:06.081
It's like his eyes follow you.

20:07.687 --> 20:12.397
I think you'll also
are interested.

20:23.369 --> 20:29.765
Why is there a teepee in his chest carved?
- Tipi?

20:29.891 --> 20:32.644
I think it's a V.

20:38.892 --> 20:41.851
Yes.
- Maybe. Yes.

20:42.593 --> 20:46.044
dick Why you think all of Fooger?
- I love my job. I do not want problems.

20:46.173 --> 20:50.565
Can not you see that a problem?

20:53.255 --> 20:59.365
Previously I looked forward to the dirt
out there. In the madhouse.

21:02.376 --> 21:07.815
We had dirt
to bring the loading dock...

21:07.937 --> 21:12.250
and there was a mural of a jungle...

21:13.338 --> 21:18.049
long ago by a few patients had been signed.

21:18.899 --> 21:25.612
It was hidden behind the container.
Almost nobody knew about it off.

21:26.621 --> 21:29.970
But if the container
a little moved...

21:31.021 --> 21:38.370
And because the sun never shone,
the colors were as beautiful as ever.

21:39.423 --> 21:44.100
So you got going by
a finger painting of a few crazies?

21:44.224 --> 21:48.342
That hospital was a zombie you, Ken
. You had no business there.

21:48.464 --> 21:52.814
Certainly not with all those people who walk around with
freedoms they do not deserve.

21:52.815 --> 21:54.810
That is a fucking joke.

22:00.947 --> 22:08.130
We're outta here. Have you counted the cash register?
- Sure.

22:08.268 --> 22:14.139
I have everything cleaned.
- You have the door is not locked.

22:19.710 --> 22:24.262
Sorry, we're closed.
- Do you have something?

22:27.231 --> 22:29.366
Okay, we're closed.

22:29.466 --> 22:34.325
I just wanted to thank you for the music
.

22:36.793 --> 22:39.831
My mother said that you had given me.

22:39.954 --> 22:43.867
But she did not think I knew
because she did not want that I met you.

22:47.675 --> 22:50.986
Amy?
- Yes.

22:53.516 --> 22:57.635
So I guess I just wanted to thank
.

23:00.197 --> 23:02.677
welcome.

23:02.878 --> 23:04.458
Yes.

23:05.198 --> 23:10.512
Have a good evening then.
- Yes, you too.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.278
Thank you.

23:14.320 --> 23:17.710
You have really good ice.

23:25.682 --> 23:30.177
You have a daughter.
- Yes.

23:30.178 --> 23:32.578
How old is she?
- Elf.

23:33.043 --> 23:38.477
Who is the mother?
- Janet Wheeler.

23:41.845 --> 23:47.796
That girl one week where you had something?
Did you pregnant?

23:49.206 --> 23:55.282
I heard it after she had dumped me.
I looked her afterwards.

23:55.407 --> 24:01.278
I bought all my money with an engagement ring.
So hear. I asked her to marry him.

24:05.209 --> 24:08.918
She wanted nothing to do with me.
She said it was better if...

24:09.049 --> 24:12.281
they pretended did not exist.
I could not really blame her.

24:13.450 --> 24:16.363
So when you...

24:17.491 --> 24:19.482
Yes.

24:35.574 --> 24:37.929
Hi, Dad.

24:42.935 --> 24:47.331
Right. I knew I had to tell you something
. Your daughter is here.

24:47.332 --> 24:49.332
Yes. I've noticed.

24:49.457 --> 24:54.611
An hour ago she stood on the sidewalk
so surprised that stuff I already did.

24:54.737 --> 25:01.497
And you let her just walk in?
- She touched on my obstacle.

25:01.619 --> 25:04.850
Did you even tell me this?
- Not now, Mom.

25:04.979 --> 25:11.853
That seems a bit late for that.
Now go in and say hello, as normal.

25:11.981 --> 25:16.418
I know nothing about her.
- She's eleven and talkative.

25:16.541 --> 25:22.936
has a big appetite.
- She can not stay here.

25:23.062 --> 25:27.342
It continues.
But you could leave.

25:29.704 --> 25:34.654
Turn around.
Forward.

25:34.785 --> 25:37.982
Can you say "hello"?

25:38.105 --> 25:43.658
Ga just say hello. Can you?
She's your daughter.

25:51.708 --> 25:54.745
instance, I know him.

25:54.868 --> 25:57.289
Did they just show up at your house?
- Yes.

25:57.389 --> 26:01.183
That's great, Ken.
- No, you know. I do not know what to do.

26:02.349 --> 26:08.620
Put your life back on track.
You're 34 and working in an ice cream parlor.

26:08.751 --> 26:12.426
Just like you.
- Yes, but I'm a loser, Ken.

26:12.551 --> 26:17.228
You used to have enthusiasm and ambition.
- You're not a loser.

26:17.352 --> 26:20.823
I wish you would not
in the wrong.

26:20.953 --> 26:25.026
After you left I tried
a few other things.

26:25.153 --> 26:30.182
delivered newspapers, was a vuilman,
I removed even snow.

26:30.754 --> 26:37.275
I even wanted to go to the police.
But the sheriff laughed at me.

26:37.396 --> 26:41.355
Wild  your agent?
- That's not the point.

26:41.476 --> 26:46.073
That girl is your daughter.
You have the right to be with her.

26:48.118 --> 26:50.473
Yes, but it just comes
not look good.

26:50.598 --> 26:54.228
You said it yourself.
That Janet wants you to fail.

26:54.359 --> 26:59.354
Go home and do some trouble
instead of hanging around here.

26:59.480 --> 27:03.837
If you do not for yourself,
do it for me. Please?

27:14.162 --> 27:20.159
Where is my father going?
- That pull I usually do not.

27:20.283 --> 27:23.401
It must be weird for him.

27:24.444 --> 27:28.474
At one time he does his thing
and suddenly I'm there.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.798
You know me, Grandma?

27:32.845 --> 27:39.002
call me Ruth. Grandma sounds so old.
- Ruth just sounds old.

27:42.207 --> 27:45.120
I like you.

27:47.128 --> 27:48.858
Let's talk.

28:03.020 --> 28:05.020
An eye for an eye.

28:11.212 --> 28:14.250
Sleep well, dear.

28:18.374 --> 28:21.332
How do you think, asshole?

28:28.695 --> 28:31.574
Morning.

28:32.696 --> 28:37.612
Good morning.
- Where were you last night go?

28:38.657 --> 28:44.176
I had to do everything.
- Like what?

28:46.138 --> 28:50.655
I had a friend.
- That is good.

28:51.899 --> 28:54.460
Just so you know, my mother
know I'm here.

28:54.580 --> 28:58.938
After 11 years of lying,
she let me spend a week with you.

29:01.741 --> 29:04.133
Do not have a school?
- It's Sunday.

29:04.134 --> 29:06.134
course.

29:07.702 --> 29:10.695
course.

29:15.623 --> 29:19.655
If you are 11 years,
then you're still in sixth grade?

29:19.784 --> 29:24.336
Group seven. I have beaten a year.
I have a good brain.

29:27.426 --> 29:31.943
Can you believe that we have come together against
? This should be a sign.

29:32.067 --> 29:37.142
must mean that we had to spend time together.

29:38.188 --> 29:40.827
Maybe.

29:42.268 --> 29:46.247
Would you like coffee?
- No thank you, have ever tried...

29:46.348 --> 29:48.726
and spent one week can not sleep.

29:51.270 --> 29:54.676
We have a lot to do,
I want to know everything about you.

29:54.977 --> 29:57.620
What is my father like to do?
Do you like to fix things?

29:57.751 --> 30:02.826
No, not really.
- Are you good in bowling?

30:02.952 --> 30:06.628
I'm sure not.

30:09.913 --> 30:14.305
Did you know that I
basketball team is? In the defense.

30:14.434 --> 30:16.949
Then you're so pretty good.

30:17.150 --> 30:20.465
Yes, actually I
the best of the team.

30:22.516 --> 30:26.794
I gotta go. Training.
Bye, Dad.

30:29.997 --> 30:34.594
I start a daily schedule to get
to where I can not get used.

30:35.638 --> 30:38.311
That will  you later.

30:39.959 --> 30:44.077
I would appreciate that you
have arranged this job for me.

30:45.520 --> 30:49.752
I wish I could do.
I mean it really.

30:56.922 --> 31:01.112
What a workout, I was always good
but tonight it was horrible.

31:01.242 --> 31:06.840
I was really good rock, rose
the three points and position did...

31:06.963 --> 31:10.513
Frankly I had pity
with the other girls.

31:11.844 --> 31:16.555
Would you like some ice cream?
- No, I came to keep you company...

31:16.685 --> 31:19.201
to get to know each other better.

31:19.326 --> 31:22.794
This is not a cocktail bar.
- Of course not, sir.

31:22.926 --> 31:27.840
Table  four has
new chewing gum under the table. Go to work.

31:30.768 --> 31:34.602
Hello, sir?
You're rich, right?

31:36.328 --> 31:40.418
Well, I do it well.
- Believe me best. Which car do you have?

31:40.649 --> 31:44.444
Champagne Camry.
- So that's a nice car, sir.

31:44.545 --> 31:49.247
How fast is he?
- I once drove 145 km / h along.

31:49.371 --> 31:53.477
Cool, I'll say
my parents that I want a car when I grow up.

31:53.478 --> 31:57.891
Thank you, sir.
- Nice girl.

32:28.098 --> 32:31.249
Now shit you have in your pants, huh?

32:44.221 --> 32:48.533
Hello .
- Where the hell are you?

32:48.661 --> 32:52.701
I'm doing something.
- Come home.

32:52.822 --> 32:56.372
How old was my father in this picture?
- I have some pressure, Mom.

32:56.503 --> 33:01.703
She does not stop talking.
- Is this my father with a beard?

33:01.824 --> 33:06.103
Home. Now.
- Give me 10 minutes.

33:45.952 --> 33:50.867
It would be easier if a return address on it.

33:50.992 --> 33:55.032
<i> I bring righteousness' </ i></i>

34:31.679 --> 34:36.311
That's odd.

34:38.920 --> 34:44.792
What happens in my town, Sheriff?
- We do everything we can, sir.

34:44.922 --> 34:48.962
This is clearly not sufficient.
- With all due respect...

34:49.083 --> 34:54.954
no outside help if you ask
then Ernie and I fix it.

34:55.083 --> 34:58.599
These other two
there can not even read properly.

35:00.805 --> 35:04.685
You can not tie our feet
and ask us to sprint.

35:04.806 --> 35:09.800
Ask
strengthen and take my badge, and shut up.

35:15.207 --> 35:18.484
Very fascinating eh, Ernie.
- Fascinating?

35:18.608 --> 35:24.559
Look at it from a larger perspective.
This part of the hole.

35:24.689 --> 35:29.810
The killer used
abstract expressionism...

35:30.850 --> 35:36.804
and Dadaism
a tribute to the great work of Marcel Duchamp.

35:38.732 --> 35:41.750
The body is displayed as...

35:41.951 --> 35:45.969
a sense of minimalist
unnatural now.

35:46.093 --> 35:49.244
Like
container and wicker chair.

35:49.373 --> 35:54.289
Then you see a bathtub, where
person is imprisoned.

35:56.215 --> 35:59.252
I bring justice.

36:01.216 --> 36:05.732
Punishment.
- Punishment for what?

36:16.098 --> 36:18.408
I have no idea.

36:21.899 --> 36:25.712
Why to smell eucalyptus?
- How is the spaghetti, honey?

36:25.740 --> 36:29.856
Great, thank you.
Cook you, Daddy?

36:29.981 --> 36:32.933
I once made lasagna.
- It was pretty good.

36:32.934 --> 36:34.134
Really?

36:34.261 --> 36:37.095
Do not make me a lie
time, Ken.

36:38.822 --> 36:44.455
What do you think of Green Oaks?
- It's fun, not much actually happens.

36:44.583 --> 36:48.338
We have an owl
festival a few weeks.

36:50.264 --> 36:54.702
There are some murders.
- Walt, here we do not talk about.

36:54.825 --> 36:56.419
She is a big girl.
How old are you 19?

36:56.720 --> 36:58.614
11.
- That was close.

36:58.746 --> 37:02.056
Do you have any idea who does it?
- Let me put it this way, baby.

37:02.186 --> 37:04.621
If you already have the instructions
stops in a bucket...

37:04.747 --> 37:08.497
and you put your head in,
you would not drown.

37:09.828 --> 37:12.677
Do not say that the mayor.

37:31.532 --> 37:34.392
Dad?
- Hi.

37:34.512 --> 37:39.029
What are you doing?
- Shopping.

37:39.153 --> 37:44.087
In Clifton? You have come
to give me a lift right?

37:45.634 --> 37:48.786
That should be 'Yes' mean.

37:54.976 --> 38:00.282
What is this?
- This is for when it rains...

38:00.283 --> 38:04.191
then the floor is wet.
Then I use that to absorb it.

38:05.418 --> 38:08.075
Your car stinks.
- I'm sorry.

38:08.110 --> 38:09.633
Does not matter.

38:09.978 --> 38:14.911
Good that you drive. I have eight times
driving under the influence.

38:15.039 --> 38:19.272
I'm joking.
Let's go.

38:22.521 --> 38:25.821
What's this?
- It's an ice cream sundae.

38:25.822 --> 38:28.777
boring though.
- Would not you?

38:28.802 --> 38:32.511
We need as many
flavors blend.

38:32.642 --> 38:35.816
Cranberries, yogurt candy...

38:35.817 --> 38:39.191
coconut, caramel sauce.

38:42.804 --> 38:46.161
You must make it tasteful.

38:48.845 --> 38:52.441
Have candy worms here?
- That's disgusting.

38:52.566 --> 38:55.106
You should be ashamed.
- I do too.

38:55.207 --> 38:57.846
Look what I
at the gas station bought.

38:57.967 --> 38:59.559
<i> 'Honk at me,
I'm an idiot.' </ i></i>

38:59.687 --> 39:02.447
I know a few who need it.
- Yes , me too.

39:02.548 --> 39:05.208
I am no longer able to get.
That was the last.

39:09.729 --> 39:14.402
Do not look now, but a woman
you is viewing.

39:18.999 --> 39:22.023
She is looking, going to help her.

39:22.824 --> 39:24.648
Betsy can help her.

39:26.779 --> 39:29.351
Betsy, can you come here?
- What do you do?

39:29.552 --> 39:33.323
My father helps the customer does.
I have a question about bees.

39:33.953 --> 39:36.585
Ken, do you want to do here.

39:38.334 --> 39:43.648
Hi, Ken, right?
- Stephanie.

39:43.779 --> 39:47.772
Hi, Stephanie.
- Is that your daughter?

39:48.496 --> 39:53.013
So you
awaiting the outcome of the paternity test?

39:53.139 --> 39:56.115
No, she's my daughter.

39:59.738 --> 40:02.552
She loves you.
- You think so?

40:02.753 --> 40:04.767
Yes, certainly.

40:05.939 --> 40:11.060
know what, I write
my phone number...

40:11.180 --> 40:15.732
for a banana shake
if you can make for me.

40:18.421 --> 40:23.242
course, if you pay $ 2.90,
then that is fine.

40:24.702 --> 40:29.902
I'm serious,
if my boss finds out he makes me.

40:40.205 --> 40:43.112
You think it's nice, huh?
- Natural...

40:43.113 --> 40:46.019
why would I order it.

40:49.207 --> 40:52.175
Thank you.

40:54.668 --> 40:57.978
Goodbye.
- Bye.

41:05.449 --> 41:09.926
Well, where you take her with you?
- I'll not call her.

41:10.550 --> 41:15.261
That's what women want fun.
- I'm not in shape for dating.

41:15.391 --> 41:18.609
Then you work to it.
I have homework.

41:19.010 --> 41:22.628
Think about where your hair grows,
we are talking about it later.

41:25.793 --> 41:29.868
Besides, Betsy
know a lot of sex off.

41:55.378 --> 41:57.947
seat.

41:58.248 --> 42:02.016
Am I interrupting?
- We have a date.

42:02.339 --> 42:05.555
date?
- We need to practice.

42:06.600 --> 42:10.253
I do not know much about you, and I
know you're not a talker.

42:10.681 --> 42:14.794
It does not matter. Let her talk.
Women like to talk.

42:15.022 --> 42:17.400
Listen.

42:18.923 --> 42:22.913
Listening?
I can do.

42:26.324 --> 42:30.716
Can you give me a question?
- Ask a Question? So I have to talk?

42:30.845 --> 42:34.399
A little, at the entrance
bring.

42:42.887 --> 42:46.846
No? Nothing?
- Give me a minute.

42:50.828 --> 42:53.019
Okay, I start it.

42:54.649 --> 42:56.777
How did you get that?
- I do not talk about it.

42:56.778 --> 42:58.529
An attack by a cave bear?

42:58.649 --> 43:03.246
A sword fight?
- Not quite.

43:04.451 --> 43:08.707
Your scar is better than that of Harry Potter. Lightning Bolt.

43:15.813 --> 43:20.568
I must have a nickname.
- A nickname?

43:20.693 --> 43:23.291
The iron man, the admiral, the postman.

43:23.714 --> 43:26.521
If you have a nickname, then suddenly people
invent a nickname for you.

43:26.522 --> 43:31.453
Because Amy is a bit drowsy.
I see myself more as a Georgina.

43:33.296 --> 43:37.325
I like Amy.
- I liked today.

43:37.957 --> 43:42.370
Really?
- We should do that more often.

43:47.578 --> 43:51.794
Would you tuck me in?
Come on, it's easy.

43:52.619 --> 43:55.330
According to statistics, die five to ten
people to tuck their daughter...

43:55.331 --> 43:57.331
in each year.

44:10.542 --> 44:14.821
Who is the eleven year old girl here?

44:18.804 --> 44:22.814
Sleep well, you.

44:29.866 --> 44:33.575
Open or closed?
- Open.

44:35.427 --> 44:39.102
much?
- Yes, that's good. Thank you.

44:41.728 --> 44:45.345
not screwed up.

44:51.950 --> 44:55.738
We make it exciting
in our folding.

44:59.191 --> 45:02.946
I would like the vegetable.

45:04.592 --> 45:09.542
I would like curried goat,
and if I want extra chops.

45:15.853 --> 45:20.990
I'm here about 8 months, I think.
I wanted to get away from Cincinnati.

45:22.315 --> 45:25.828
Cincinnati?
- Before London.

45:26.756 --> 45:29.907
I followed a boy to the U.S.,
when it appeared that he was married.

45:30.036 --> 45:33.871
We knew nothing of each other.
What I do not recommend.

45:35.437 --> 45:38.896
What do you think of Green Oaks?

45:38.897 --> 45:42.355
So far, so good.

45:42.479 --> 45:46.416
I work at a travel agency,
which worked pretty fucked up.

45:46.517 --> 45:48.953
That other woman smells like charcoal.

45:49.080 --> 45:52.311
I use it only to
cheap to buy tickets.

45:52.440 --> 45:55.535
I would like
fly back to England to see my parents...

45:55.536 --> 45:58.630
and pie eating.

46:06.723 --> 46:08.962
Do you like traveling?

46:09.963 --> 46:12.401
I do not know.
- You do not know?

46:14.564 --> 46:19.559
I've never really traveled.
- Never go anywhere?

46:19.594 --> 46:21.755
How is that possible?

46:24.326 --> 46:28.403
I am gone.
- Gone? In prison?

46:29.507 --> 46:33.342
Something like that.
Cotton Valley Hospital.

46:33.377 --> 46:37.174
Is not that...

46:37.175 --> 46:41.081
A place for the insane? Yes.

46:44.730 --> 46:47.290
I close my eyes and I'll give you
the chance to leave.

46:47.291 --> 46:49.850
I'm not offended.

46:52.771 --> 46:58.644
My ex-husband was a graduate of Harvard
pediatrician.

47:00.152 --> 47:03.619
It turned out he was an alcoholic,
and filmed me while I slept...

47:03.720 --> 47:06.286
and he deceived me and
verklootte the entire marriage.

47:08.174 --> 47:10.210
I would not condemn anyone.

47:37.299 --> 47:42.010
It always amazes me how people
as detailed painting.

47:43.300 --> 47:46.896
If I were to paint a painting,
with a sword somewhere pointing.

47:47.021 --> 47:50.650
Would you really think
what she has now painted?

47:50.781 --> 47:53.660
This is really great.

47:54.402 --> 47:57.614
Yes, it is beautiful.

47:58.703 --> 48:01.459
What have we here?

48:01.460 --> 48:04.215
A frustrated artist or a harsh critic?

48:04.744 --> 48:08.775
No, I let the art
about the artists.

48:11.045 --> 48:12.979
No.

48:18.666 --> 48:22.626
I can not believe they
I have no compulsion to buy.

48:28.428 --> 48:32.120
Crazy, huh?
- It was fun.

48:32.221 --> 48:33.221
Thank you.
- I.

48:34.449 --> 48:36.944
I enjoyed.
- This is beautiful.

48:42.270 --> 48:44.250
Good evening.
- This painting is for you.

48:44.571 --> 48:47.061
beautiful. Thank you.

48:47.991 --> 48:49.246
I do not know where...

48:50.147 --> 48:53.102
Can you open the door.
- Sure.

48:55.313 --> 48:58.073
Take it easy.

49:27.038 --> 49:29.517
What are you doing, Kenny?
- Hey, Sheriff.

49:29.918 --> 49:32.796
Just a little time for myself
to sign.

49:32.919 --> 49:36.833
To my thoughts straight.
- I understand.

49:37.380 --> 49:43.035
happens a lot lately.
So signs will help you with that.

49:44.281 --> 49:48.958
For me it's chess.
I play the game, but to think about...

49:49.082 --> 49:52.598
relaxes me do,
for some reason.

49:55.283 --> 49:58.240
Let me see that.

50:04.165 --> 50:07.400
Come on, Ken, I've heard
you're talented.

50:07.926 --> 50:10.916
Who said that?
- From your pal Irv.

50:11.246 --> 50:14.723
I heard that he wanted to give you
to the man of the owls festival...

50:15.024 --> 50:18.724
giving you a brochure, or flyer for them
can make.

50:18.847 --> 50:23.000
Really?
- Yes, certainly.

50:23.128 --> 50:28.203
He forced Glen so what, but I think he
has already found someone.

50:28.329 --> 50:33.388
Irv I've never seen so nervous,
especially for something that captivated him.

50:33.489 --> 50:35.247
Would you like gum?

50:36.391 --> 50:39.651
Yes.
- Please.

50:40.651 --> 50:44.645
Let me see that.

50:53.434 --> 50:56.190
Wait.
Do you see that.

50:56.914 --> 51:00.571
That's nice, Kenny.
Brilliant.

51:01.855 --> 51:05.644
I really think...
- Do you?

51:07.036 --> 51:10.727
You have an eye for detail, boy.

51:16.618 --> 51:20.652
Well, I'll leave you alone.

51:21.139 --> 51:24.128
nice day further.

51:31.420 --> 51:35.596
I do not see Ernie,
what I see tire tracks are...

51:35.631 --> 51:37.573
and mud.
You say I...

51:37.701 --> 51:42.093
a hidden picture of Jesus should look like.

51:42.222 --> 51:46.261
No, only the tracks. These are
traces of the outdoor cinema.

51:46.283 --> 51:49.889
They are the brand of Yokohama Avid T4.

51:49.890 --> 51:53.495
It is a normal band.

51:54.965 --> 51:57.914
Why?
- Gary the tire shop said...

51:57.915 --> 52:00.863
model that he has sold hundreds of customers
in this area alone.

52:01.666 --> 52:04.942
Ga but with Gary
get a list and then...

52:05.887 --> 52:08.204
check your references
of Green Oaks High.

52:08.205 --> 52:12.762
Green Oaks High?
- All the victims were from Green Oaks High.

52:12.763 --> 52:16.197
is currently the only connection we have.

52:18.629 --> 52:23.020
extra ijsbol at my expense.
- Thank you.

52:23.150 --> 52:25.606
a nice day.

52:25.807 --> 52:28.862
Irv, can you do me a favor?
- Yes, say it again.

52:28.991 --> 52:31.530
I want to train Amy are
you can fill in for me?

52:31.931 --> 52:34.831
Yeah man, of course.
- Thanks a lot.

52:36.672 --> 52:42.383
Come on, it smells like dirty
we call it basketball?

52:42.513 --> 52:47.049
Does anyone know how you play?
This is terrible, ladies. Come on.

52:47.474 --> 52:51.787
I get headaches from you.
This is nonsense.

52:51.915 --> 52:55.032
My apologies, you should do your best
more.

52:55.155 --> 52:59.627
And you must learn to cook.
You can not play basketball.

52:59.756 --> 53:01.796
Okay, ladies
all stand for the hoop.

53:02.197 --> 53:05.036
Very good.

53:05.157 --> 53:09.068
One more and I swooned.
Very nice.

53:09.998 --> 53:13.513
Keep moving.
Faster.

53:17.759 --> 53:21.688
That was a good,
I saw your conversion.

53:23.500 --> 53:26.252
Okay, come on.

53:26.781 --> 53:30.451
I'm going outside.
And you keep playing.

53:30.482 --> 53:34.221
Would you like Wheeler are?
No, you do not.

53:34.742 --> 53:39.036
Keep playing like you or
know how you play basketball.

53:46.284 --> 53:51.395
Hey, Wheeler.
- Is this about the game?

53:51.525 --> 53:55.022
I'm trying to figure out why you still on the team...

53:55.123 --> 53:57.920
if you know you do not get playing time.
- Yes.

53:58.046 --> 54:02.967
wear dress makes you really have no player.

54:03.287 --> 54:06.325
That you kuisheidsring
wears really makes you not a virgin.

54:06.448 --> 54:08.643
What did you say?

54:12.069 --> 54:14.842
Ga but the suits.

54:29.872 --> 54:34.351
Next time you see someone your own age approaches.

54:36.453 --> 54:39.014
Well done, friend.

54:43.174 --> 54:47.374
Sorry, I'm not laughing at you
accident.

54:47.375 --> 54:48.375
know...

54:49.815 --> 54:53.092
It's okay, if you follow the same time
car looks...

54:53.193 --> 54:54.970
will be a bit uncomfortable.

54:55.096 --> 54:58.545
I refuse to drive.
It's about control.

54:58.645 --> 55:01.334
a small wrong move,
than someone dies.

55:01.435 --> 55:04.051
That's too much power for me.

55:04.178 --> 55:08.650
I want all the power.
- You're father, you have all the power.

55:08.779 --> 55:12.294
That's the worst comment of the world.

55:12.419 --> 55:15.355
Hey, good thing, come take a
times along the Surplus Store along.

55:15.390 --> 55:17.892
I see you
secondhand goods with you.

55:22.681 --> 55:24.796
Here we go.

55:31.623 --> 55:34.501
What an asshole.

55:34.644 --> 55:38.637
know what we should do?
We need to buy something for Amy.

55:39.064 --> 55:43.675
buy her? What then?
- I do not know. Use your imagination.

55:56.167 --> 56:00.915
Are you ready for some action?
- I'm tired.

56:01.116 --> 56:03.664
I had a tough workout.
- I know.

56:04.088 --> 56:06.637
What do you know?
- I know that you are bad.

56:06.738 --> 56:09.787
I came to pick you up.

56:10.450 --> 56:12.439
I've seen.

56:12.570 --> 56:16.343
The coach had eight players needed
but I do not bake much.

56:16.471 --> 56:19.428
It does not matter.
Show me what you can.

56:19.829 --> 56:21.785
Come on.

56:25.993 --> 56:28.224
I can throw that
learn, if you wish.

56:29.453 --> 56:34.111
Balance. Legs equal
with the shoulders.

56:35.454 --> 56:39.681
Bend your knees. Keep
ball with this hand...

56:39.982 --> 56:42.508
and you throw the ball with
the other hand, okay?

56:43.976 --> 56:45.753
That is good.

56:47.600 --> 56:49.158
Look at me.

56:53.320 --> 56:58.838
Were you in the team at school?
- Not really.

56:59.300 --> 57:01.575
You like mystery?

57:03.600 --> 57:08.689
I have not met the team.
- A reply. That was not so difficult?

57:11.840 --> 57:13.413
Shooting .

57:21.640 --> 57:24.057
I think that was it closer.

57:28.960 --> 57:32.714
It looks like a terrible card,
I do not understand.

57:38.080 --> 57:41.871
yet six more,
and we have a basketball team.

57:42.600 --> 57:47.355
Not the right time, sorry.
- Where are the yearbooks?

57:53.760 --> 57:56.157
you going out?
- Yeah, so.

57:57.080 --> 58:00.314
Where are you going?
- I need to arrange things.

58:03.600 --> 58:09.851
We have a big game Thursday.
I want you to come watch, will you come?

58:11.640 --> 58:16.592
Of course, I will follow.
- Stephanie And bring along.

58:17.320 --> 58:20.392
You find her cute, right?
- Yes.

58:20.520 --> 58:22.359
Player.

58:24.480 --> 58:29.600
Okay, I'll call her.
- Well, I'm the one who sits on the couch.

58:34.720 --> 58:37.998
Okay, goodnight.
- Goodnight.

59:15.560 --> 59:21.317
They're all in the same team.
Yes, look, the B. ..

59:21.440 --> 59:23.502
Black Jack and the map of the U.S..

59:23.602 --> 59:28.198
He goes the whole team down.
- One of whom lives here.

59:40.680 --> 59:44.870
Miller's. No, we are closed.

59:45.600 --> 59:48.475
We open at nine o'clock.
Nine o'clock.

59:52.520 --> 59:56.035
Damn, motherfucker.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:05.211
Who is it doing?

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:15.410
I just cleaned this weapon.
This does not do that.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:31.618
I sat in the Green Berets, asshole.
And in the navy.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.269
And I sat in Gettysburg.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.913
What's this?

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:49.635
I think I still have bullets.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:08.112
He has not dumped the body, why?
- Well, given the track outside...

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.753
he departed with great haste.
Something has disturbed him.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.819
He was scared.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.672
Do you think he is ready?

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.115
Sir?

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.433
Thank you, darling.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.810
We found a body last night.

01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:45.510
Really?

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.150
What happened to your hand?

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.737
I opened a box of chocolate sprinkles,
and cut the box in my hand.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.954
You have a risky job.
You should be more careful.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:11.435
And if your hand gets a scar
your wrist gets a new friend.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.658
I gotta go.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:25.835
tire tracks at Miller's shop, come
reflect those of the drive-in cinema.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:31.239
And according to Gary, the tire business, Ken has
a few months ago bought a set.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:37.638
Yes, it is the same band.
But enough with Boyd to hold.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:42.753
He went to the Green Oaks High.
- What is his connection with the basketball?

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.877
Can we pick him
to interrogate?

01:04:45.878 --> 01:04:50.118
No, not yet. Boyd may be crazy,
but I can not nab him for that.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.917
Besides, I like Ruth and his son inreken
it'm wrong...

01:04:53.717 --> 01:04:56.713
the story is over.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.798
Hi, how are you?

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:06.920
Hi, I'm going to work.
- Good.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:26.654
I'm going to buy cigarettes, you want some?
- No, too much to multiply fractions.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:28.755
Okay, I'll be back soon.

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.913
What have you done?

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:54.055
Pardon?
- She's gone.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.970
I went away, and when I came back,
she was gone.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.873
I thought I told you that you do not
had to screw up.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:40.073
It did not work.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:48.719
I hate to say I told you so '.
- Do not do it.

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:58.676
Now you know why I wanted to keep away from him
. He is a loser, Amy.

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:43.233
Asshole.

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:47.538
It's been three days.
Come inside, you're just in time.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:52.638
I know what it is about.
But I follow the speed limit.

01:09:53.979 --> 01:09:56.330
<i> horn TO ME, I AM an asshole </ i></i>

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.101
you working tonight?

01:10:05.121 --> 01:10:07.993
I asked for Betsy's service.
- I thought you had to Amy's race?

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.636
No, I did not go.
- Why?

01:10:11.569 --> 01:10:15.729
She is gone.
- Why?

01:10:15.829 --> 01:10:17.669
I do not know.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.839
Have her call?
Come on Ken, why not?

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.433
Because I have not done.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.017
Who I took the mickey,
I am her father.

01:10:29.905 --> 01:10:32.136
It was better if I had thought
that I was not there.

01:10:32.137 --> 01:10:34.687
I told you not to come near me
.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.713
Whatever, man.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.414
No extra scoop?
- Not today.

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:02.599
me.
Stephanie...

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:06.517
I called just to see if everything was okay.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:12.237
I think we had plans for tonight
to Amy's race to go.

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:17.034
So, give us a call, or...

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:27.796
Come on, if you do not want to lose.
Keep moving.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.790
Defense, ladies.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:46.038
What was that? Come on, Frasier.
You're a jackal. Be hard. Come here.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:50.358
Wheeler, inside.
- Very funny, coach.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:53.346
with 28 points and six seconds to go
I'm curious...

01:11:53.446 --> 01:11:55.600
to see if you have a few points in
can make.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.755
Insanely

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:10.574
What are you doing here?
- It's nice to see you.

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:13.914
What do you want?

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:22.958
I came along to hear
why you have let me down.

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:27.789
I had to work.
- Could not you call it?

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.992
This will not work.

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:43.557
I do not understand.
Because, we had a nice time together.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.435
<i> There are a series of crimes reported. </ I></i>

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.996
<i>
There are four murders in the small town, Green Oaks. .. </ i></i>

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:33.636
<i> Kenneth Boyd, 34, a citizen,
was arrested late last night... </ i></i>

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.038
<i> for his involvement in the gruesome murders of four other civilians
from Green Oaks. </ i></i>

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.311
<i> All of them are killed, according to the police, < br /> premeditated... </ i></i>

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.962
<i> with an ax, a machete and a butcher knife
... </ i></i>

01:14:44.062 --> 01:14:46.798
<i> Boyd was recently discharged from the hospital
Cotton Valley... </ i></i>

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:50.230
<i> after he stayed there after a heavy
depression, and suicidal. </ i></i>

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.636
<i> The victims were identified as
Marty Prichard, Wade Hutchinson... </ i></i>

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.352
<i> Lyle Bagwell and Brett Miller. </ i></i>

01:14:55.452 --> 01:14:57.392
<i>
All local people from the business... </ i></i>

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:11.589
I must admit, Kenny ,
I was hoping you would not be.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:15.554
Put that thing on, please.
The red button and then play.

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:24.959
Sorry I've been in your room.
But, but these drawings...

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.992
these drawings are beautiful, everyone.

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:31.215
Check it out.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:36.516
a warped way.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:44.670
also left you behind at the crime scene.

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:49.053
That is now with tires,
they leave traces.

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:58.072
It took a while to relate
with you to see.

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:02.857
Who would so hate basketball,
he kills them after so many years?

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:12.275
I was with the mayor today...
Want some gum?

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:16.415
We discussed the upcoming festival...

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:24.953
Then it hit me.
Who has a motive? Who?

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.209
Who?

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.296
Who?

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.490
Exactly.

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.176
Owl.

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:04.914
Irv Listen, I'm sorry about your friend.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:10.460
You came for him, and he let you down.
But how shocking is that?

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.396
I mean, your whole life all screw up, then you
sometime flipping.

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:21.394
Come on, show me what Fooger energy.

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:59.775
I hoped we could talk about my father?
- You mean now?

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.116
You knew him well.
Maybe you can clarify something for me.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:09.357
Yes, of course. Come inside.
- Thank you.

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:16.858
Visited him often as he was gone?

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:23.912
No.
Ga a seat there.

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.891
How so?

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:36.093
You should know that I wanted to, but it was difficult
.

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:41.874
I did not see him so happy.

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:47.735
Why he hate basketball so much?

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:54.911
He wanted to love the team.

01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:00.518
When he did not, he was bitter.
He became their mascot.

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:06.468
,
a while he felt like one of them.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:10.673
But the assholes of the team
saw it not.

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:21.670
And it got worse and worse,
to a certain point...

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:26.179
that they thought they could do anything with him.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.878
came from his comic book
and he let them look like idiots.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.596
Those players were accustomed to
be treated like kings.

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:41.191
And now, the whole school laughed them off.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:51.172
one night...

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.459
they decided to take revenge.

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.473
What did they do?

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:08.708
Want some water?
I get you some water.

01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:16.236
He has not known?
- No.

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.916
But he has not been denied.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.770
He just sat there.

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:33.190
I never thought that he would do something to someone.

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:40.858
It is hard to imagine
what they have done with him.

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.256
Whatever it was, fed very deep.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.873
It sounds a bit strange because I
your son just got arrested...

01:20:55.874 --> 01:20:58.334
for the murder of a bunch of people.
But I hope...

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:04.233
that with time,
comes over it.

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.594
I think not.

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:20.371
Do you mind if I grab a beer
the go?

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.775
I'll drink and drive.
So do not tell the police.

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:37.036
that Amy has for me.
Damn cute or not?

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:51.076
I wish I was creative.
It must be incredibly liberating.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:59.516
Please .
- Thank you.

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.824
What was that?

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:13.294
That's my cat.
He hates being locked up.

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:16.271
I did not know you had a cat.
Which race?

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.950
I do not know, an ordinary cat.
Are there other types?

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:28.632
Yes, there are 40 different species.
- Look, I did not know.

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:34.153
These were very good, Kenny.
Who does not love to get mail?

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:39.060
You probably very scared.

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:41.635
Do you know which is my favorite?

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:46.955
"I'm a monster '.
I got the creeps from.

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.913
You've done well.
- Thank you.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:59.073
What are you doing, Kenny?
We have never gotten that message.

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:03.637
"I'm a monster '.
That was the" Son of Sam' or something similar.

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:16.515
That was good water, thank you.

01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:23.335
Was there something you wanted to know?
- The cat does not sound so good.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:27.709
Can I greet him?
- No, he is very jumpy.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.238
So I locked him in the room when the doorbell
heard.

01:23:30.273 --> 01:23:33.890
I am good with cats.
- I'd rather not.

01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:36.868
Why?
- I'm a little overprotective.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.278
I'll be good for him, I promise.
- Not today, Amy.

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:45.029
Your cat sounds sick.
- All is well with the cat.

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:49.609
I thought it was a he.
- I can not now use.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:58.438
I think it is better that
you're going home.

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:01.497
Okay, I'll go. I'm sorry.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.139
That's probably the best.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.053
Goodbye, Amy.

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:27.745
I looked closely at the evidence.

01:24:27.845 --> 01:24:31.318
These drawings do not indicate your direction,
but exactly the opposite.

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:34.557
You let it out in your work.

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:38.355
You kill them in your drawings,
so you do not really need to murder.

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.836
You hate those bastards
clear and you think they would be dead.

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:46.954
Maybe you even
a few crime scenes visited.

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:50.436
Maybe you even thought that
you could do.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.570
You're an artist, not a murderer.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.179
The only person you can hurt is yourself.

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:08.512
Boy, that brings us to
an interesting place here.

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:15.917
You kill a bunch of guys on paper
and then they are dead also.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:21.092
You need not have been, but there is
someone they hate as much as you.

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:28.319
Who would
would like to be punished?

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.596
Just so sick.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:42.799
Where is your friend Irv
doing lately?

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:18.729
Still, please be quiet.

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:33.192
Your father gave everything he had.
And they wanted to destroy him.

01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:37.598
They have his soul removed. They
him his life from him. I could have quit.

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:38.725
You're hurting me.

01:27:38.826 --> 01:27:41.156
Something had to happen.
I could not let them get away.

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:44.255
let me go.
- I can not, you start talking.

01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:04.073
It's over, man.
Easy.

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.576
I've never killed anyone.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.754
But when I  Prichard had murdered
felt good.

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:22.176
And when I  Wade Hutchinson had killed,
I felt really great.

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:30.593
My hatred was building. And with every asshole
I killed, I felt better.

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:41.272
<i> Ken
had never been able to do this. </ I></i>

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:45.188
<i> He could not do what had to happen. < / i></i>

01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:01.791
You have five boys.
Fooger Why?

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:05.752
I ever failed to protect him.

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.799
I did not want him back in the lurch.

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:14.517
The bad guys should be punished.

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:18.312
You are quite a friend, Irv.

01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.352
But you would have been a bad cop.

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:57.874
I wanted them dead sheriff, more than anything else.
- Yes, but you did not.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.382
thinking about a few assholes
murder, would be punishable...

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.630
life we ??would all be locked up.

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:21.573
Wait.
I must ask you something, Kenny.

01:30:23.374 --> 01:30:25.912
Why did you make pay?

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:34.573
I'm not sure what my place in this world.

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:38.808
Locked down, seemed so much easier.

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:46.268
If you do not know your purpose here,
then you're dumber than I thought.

01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:58.544
Hi, I can help.
- Yes, I'm here for my daughter.

01:30:58.745 --> 01:31:00.918
Sorry, and you are?
- Her father.

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.453
Amy.
- Ken, what are you doing here?

01:31:03.454 --> 01:31:04.654
Daddy?

01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:08.380
Hi, do you want with me?
- Totally.

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:10.094
Get your stuff.

01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:12.839
Ken, you can not just come and take her
.

01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:16.490
11 years, Janet.
It is now my turn.

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:26.109
How are you?
Good?

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:32.896
This is for you.
- What is it?

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:37.318
A little something.
- Is it a puppy?

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:48.710
<i> THE SAVIOR. </ I></i>

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:54.158
That's the best nickname ever.
Thank you, Dad.

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:27.760
I'm sorry.

01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:37.756
I'm sorry about last time,
I'm really sorry.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.995
innocent.

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:10.156
I'm excited for the weekend.
Who else is excited?

01:33:10.157 --> 01:33:11.657
What have you planned?

01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:14.464
the owls
festival... - And what have you got planned?

01:33:14.465 --> 01:33:16.879
We can do some basketball.
Can you shoot well?

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.312
It is still bad. But it gets better.
- That is good.

01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:25.956
Ma, Amy is there.
- No, really, Kenny?

01:33:35.036 --> 01:33:39.036
