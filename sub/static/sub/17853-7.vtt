WEBVTT

00:00.267 --> 00:03.068
<i>Tonight on</i>
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.070 --> 00:05.070
Here we go.

00:05.072 --> 00:08.073
As soon as that drops in you're
fifteen feet away from the void.

00:08.074 --> 00:10.075
There's a shiny gold thing
down there.

00:10.077 --> 00:11.276
- David!
- What?

00:11.278 --> 00:13.078
Drain the swamp!

00:13.080 --> 00:14.680
Way to go!

00:14.682 --> 00:17.282
We can finally start
excavating in the swamp.

00:17.284 --> 00:18.650
Look at that!

00:18.652 --> 00:20.586
This is a piece
of the Spanish Galleon.

00:20.588 --> 00:23.689
Six people have lost
their lives trying to do

00:23.691 --> 00:25.457
what you may be able to do
this afternoon.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.059
It's definitely inside
the cavity.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.221
Here you go. The door's open.

00:31.532 --> 00:35.167
<i>There is an island
in the north Atlantic...</i>

00:35.169 --> 00:37.503
<i>where people have been
looking for an incredible</i>

00:37.505 --> 00:41.273
<i>treasure for more
than 200 years.</i>

00:41.275 --> 00:45.244
<i>So far, they have found
bits of gold chain...</i>

00:45.246 --> 00:49.381
<i>a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it...</i>

00:49.383 --> 00:52.751
<i>even a 17th century
Spanish coin.</i>

00:52.753 --> 00:57.056
<i>To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.</i>

00:58.192 --> 01:00.559
<i>And, according to legend,</i>

01:00.561 --> 01:03.429
<i>one more will have to die,</i>

01:03.431 --> 01:06.331
<i>before the treasure
can be found.</i>

01:20.147 --> 01:23.082
Well, how you feeling,
Rick? V-3 is done.

01:23.084 --> 01:25.417
I'm disappointed,
I will say that.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.119
Yeah. I agree.

01:30.157 --> 01:32.658
<i>For brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina,</i>

01:32.660 --> 01:36.528
<i>their life-long dream to
solve the Oak Island mystery</i>

01:36.530 --> 01:40.232
<i>has proved to be more
elusive than they hoped.</i>

01:40.234 --> 01:41.700
Definitely got wood.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.368
<i>Two years ago,</i>

01:43.370 --> 01:44.703
<i>while searching for the location</i>

01:44.705 --> 01:46.171
<i>of the so-called Money Pit...</i>

01:46.173 --> 01:48.440
Concrete and then wood.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.741
That's the description.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.743
<i>They found what they believed</i>

01:51.745 --> 01:55.314
<i>to be evidence of
a long-lost treasure vault,</i>

01:55.316 --> 01:57.616
<i>first discovered by treasure
hunters Frederick Blair</i>

01:57.618 --> 02:00.853
<i>and William Chappell in 1897.</i>

02:00.855 --> 02:02.588
You think you're on the vault?

02:04.592 --> 02:07.759
<i>But last week, after
commissioning a massive dig</i>

02:07.761 --> 02:10.628
<i>at the same location,
known as Valley Three...</i>

02:10.631 --> 02:12.831
Got wood.

02:12.833 --> 02:16.468
<i>Their hopes of finding
the vault were crushed</i>

02:16.470 --> 02:18.737
<i>when it was discovered
that the wooden structure</i>

02:18.739 --> 02:21.173
<i>they located was in fact,</i>

02:21.175 --> 02:23.475
<i>a section of
a searcher tunnel built</i>

02:23.477 --> 02:26.845
<i>by William Chappell's son
in the 1930s.</i>

02:26.847 --> 02:28.747
Well, Rick, things here
on Oak Island

02:28.749 --> 02:30.149
seem to be changing by
the minute.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.583
What do you think of that?

02:31.585 --> 02:33.318
That would be a circular
saw cutting.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.587
If that really is
a circular saw,

02:35.589 --> 02:38.190
then it's truly not 1600.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.458
Correct.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.464
There's the island.
Let's get back to digging.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.166
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

02:47.168 --> 02:48.600
Right.

02:48.602 --> 02:51.403
Coming off of V-3,
I mean it is such

02:51.405 --> 02:53.405
a roller coaster ride from
thinking we were

02:53.407 --> 02:57.409
scraping at the top of
a sacred vault of some sort to,

02:57.411 --> 02:59.912
to breaking through and finding
out it was a searcher tunnel.

02:59.914 --> 03:02.447
I mean, it was just an
emotional roller coaster.

03:02.449 --> 03:05.417
Now we go onto C-1 and
as a team,

03:05.419 --> 03:08.453
we all think it's worth
digging and we're gonna dig it,

03:08.455 --> 03:11.690
and be prepared to be surprised.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.193
<i>The Oak Island team
has now moved</i>

03:14.195 --> 03:15.794
<i>20 feet northwest</i>

03:15.796 --> 03:17.596
<i>from their
first borehole to their</i>

03:17.598 --> 03:21.967
<i>second target in the Money Pit,
known as C-1.</i>

03:21.969 --> 03:25.470
<i>It was at this location
where last year,</i>

03:25.472 --> 03:28.807
<i>Rick Lagina and Oak Island
historian Charles Barkhouse</i>

03:28.809 --> 03:32.978
<i>discovered what they believed
to be a large cavern</i>

03:32.980 --> 03:36.815
<i>approximately 171 feet
underground.</i>

03:36.817 --> 03:39.718
- Still dropping?
- Huge cavern!

03:40.487 --> 03:42.554
Here we go.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.524
<i>But even more incredible was
what they found after they put</i>

03:45.526 --> 03:48.927
<i>a pipe inspection
camera down the hole.</i>

03:48.929 --> 03:50.896
What the hell is that?

03:50.898 --> 03:52.864
It's your gold color, David.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.300
<i>A shiny, golden object?</i>

03:55.302 --> 04:01.540
<i>Embedded in rock more than
170 feet underground?</i>

04:01.542 --> 04:04.910
<i>Could it be a piece of the
fabled Oak Island treasure?</i>

04:04.912 --> 04:07.546
<i>The one that people have
been searching for,</i>

04:07.548 --> 04:09.314
<i>and dying for,</i>

04:09.316 --> 04:11.316
<i>for more than two centuries?</i>

04:13.954 --> 04:16.521
I think what happened
in the Money Pit

04:16.523 --> 04:18.724
is still in the Money Pit,
above the bedrock.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.259
There's so question about it.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.827
Well, then it's still there.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.630
Nobody recovered that
because they couldn't have.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.966
- Exactly.
- Hole one is done.

04:27.968 --> 04:31.303
Hole two begins anew.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.974
<i>Oak Island is doing its thing.</i>

04:35.976 --> 04:40.479
It's doing what it's done to
people for 221 years.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.881
But we're still hopeful.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.584
<i>Oak Island's a giant puzzle.</i>

04:45.586 --> 04:47.286
<i>Mom used to tell us all the time</i>

04:47.288 --> 04:48.987
<i>when we would be making puzzles,</i>

04:48.989 --> 04:51.523
she'd say,
"Find the four corners.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.959
Find the four corners,
and then you can build it."

04:53.961 --> 04:57.596
Maybe, we might have one,
maybe two.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.564
But without the four corners,

04:59.566 --> 05:01.466
it's a tough puzzle to
put together.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.788
And I think that's where
we're at.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.385
- Gentlemen.
- Here we are again.

05:20.387 --> 05:21.387
How you doing?

05:22.623 --> 05:23.655
Ed.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.525
What are those rocks over there?

05:26.527 --> 05:28.527
What's those rocks? You tell me.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.961
The rocks are gettin' bigger.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.930
Really? No wood?

05:31.932 --> 05:34.099
Very little bit, very
little bits of wood.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.801
Well, let's go look at
the big rocks.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.035
Go look at the rock, yeah.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.506
<i>A lot of the areas
we've dug, it's been</i>

05:41.508 --> 05:44.042
merely on hope,
speculation and theory.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.844
Here we have an object,
a hard object

05:45.846 --> 05:47.479
to go locate and retrieve.

05:47.481 --> 05:50.615
I mean, that's
what we're here for,

05:50.617 --> 05:52.451
find something deep underground.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.885
Wow.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.054
We're lucky to get that one out.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.856
Well, that one is just barely
be able to grab.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.091
That guy's a granite boulder
there.

05:59.093 --> 06:00.792
Yeah.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.694
Not too sure what he is,
but he's a big rock.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.930
- How deep are we?
- 85 feet right now

06:04.932 --> 06:06.498
with casing and excavation.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.934
The rock was down about 73.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.936
Did you have to mess with it
for a while, or did...

06:10.938 --> 06:13.739
No. I think he just lowered
down and gripped onto it.

06:13.741 --> 06:14.973
He might have played around with
it a little bit,

06:14.975 --> 06:17.843
but came in and out in one.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.411
If we're in undisturbed ground,

06:19.413 --> 06:23.148
undisturbed by searchers,

06:23.150 --> 06:25.417
hell, we could break into
anything at any time.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.052
You're still on track though,
right? I mean...

06:27.054 --> 06:28.620
Yeah.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.055
Maybe a little bit
ahead of the curve?

06:30.057 --> 06:31.857
We're gaining ground on this one
right now.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.725
We'll see what happens when we
hit the bedrock.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.694
But we're gaining ground.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.863
Where do we expect that bedrock
to be on this one, Charles?

06:37.865 --> 06:39.998
- 150.
- 150.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.833
All right.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.935
<i>Although the team from Irving</i>

06:43.937 --> 06:47.406
<i>is currently drilling
through softer topsoil,</i>

06:47.408 --> 06:51.843
<i>once they reach the anhydrite
bedrock at 150 feet,</i>

06:51.845 --> 06:54.579
<i>they will need to take
a more cautious approach</i>

06:54.581 --> 06:56.848
<i>in their attempt to enter
the approximately</i>

06:56.850 --> 06:58.850
<i>21 foot deep void.</i>

07:00.854 --> 07:03.422
<i>Because the sections
of steel caissons</i>

07:03.424 --> 07:06.525
<i>weigh in access of 60 tons,</i>

07:06.527 --> 07:09.094
<i>they will need to be anchored
in bedrock at a depth</i>

07:09.096 --> 07:11.763
<i>of 160 feet,</i>

07:11.765 --> 07:15.700
<i>so that they don't collapse
through the chamber.</i>

07:15.702 --> 07:19.538
<i>From there, a 39-inch wide
drill bit will be used</i>

07:19.540 --> 07:22.707
<i>to cut a hole in the top
of the cavity.</i>

07:22.709 --> 07:26.111
<i>C-1 is going swimmingly
well. It's going great.</i>

07:26.113 --> 07:28.613
We'll be in that cavity
in a day or two.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.515
Look, I can't argue with
any of that.

07:30.517 --> 07:32.117
It is going well.

07:32.119 --> 07:35.220
<i>As progress at borehole C-1</i>

07:35.222 --> 07:37.789
<i>continues at the Money Pit,</i>

07:37.791 --> 07:39.958
<i>Rick, Marty, and their partners,</i>

07:39.960 --> 07:44.229
<i>shift their attention to
another project this season:</i>

07:44.231 --> 07:46.198
<i>The Oak Island swamp.</i>

07:46.200 --> 07:47.960
So you should straighten it out
a little bit.

07:50.604 --> 07:51.804
Why do we got all these hoses?

07:56.710 --> 08:00.645
Okay, so I think Marty's set up,
he's gotta get that culvert,

08:00.647 --> 08:02.848
so we can get across the
road right away.

08:02.850 --> 08:05.750
And then you guys are just gonna
have to follow the beach here.

08:05.752 --> 08:09.020
Then you can run up next to
those birch trees on the other

08:09.022 --> 08:11.957
side and then just keep heading
towards the Cave-In Pit...

08:13.494 --> 08:15.160
- and that's it.
- Got it.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.162
All right, we'll make it happen.

08:17.164 --> 08:21.500
<i>Because environmental
regulations prohibit dumping</i>

08:21.502 --> 08:23.635
<i>swamp water into the ocean,</i>

08:23.637 --> 08:28.240
<i>the team will use a 63
horsepower pump and more than</i>

08:28.242 --> 08:32.110
<i>1200 feet of hose to transfer
thousands of gallons</i>

08:32.111 --> 08:35.647
<i>of brackish water to an area
near Smith's Cove</i>

08:35.649 --> 08:38.283
<i>known as "The Cave-in Pit,"</i>

08:38.284 --> 08:42.187
<i>so named because it was formed
after an old searcher tunnel</i>

08:42.188 --> 08:44.789
<i>collapsed deep underground.</i>

08:46.560 --> 08:47.959
You got enough hose from here,
Alex?

08:47.961 --> 08:49.594
- Yeah.
- I'll back it out?

08:49.596 --> 08:52.697
Yep.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.037
<i>A few weeks ago,
after a metal detector</i>

08:59.039 --> 09:01.907
<i>indicated the presence
of a large metal object</i>

09:01.909 --> 09:04.209
<i>at the southeastern edge
of the swamp,</i>

09:04.211 --> 09:07.178
<i>Rick, Marty and the team invited</i>

09:07.180 --> 09:11.016
<i>area diver, Tony Sampson,
to try and find it.</i>

09:11.018 --> 09:13.552
There's where the anomaly
is, Tony. Right over there.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.587
Two meters
to the left of that stake.

09:15.589 --> 09:16.321
It should be quite large.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.123
Fantastic.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.991
<i>But although Tony was unable</i>

09:19.993 --> 09:22.060
<i>to locate the metal object,</i>

09:22.062 --> 09:24.963
<i>he did make an
incredible discovery.</i>

09:24.965 --> 09:27.232
- What is that?
- Wow. It's huge.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.067
Looks like a piece of wood.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.136
It's a large board.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.071
<i>Convinced that the swamp may be</i>

09:33.073 --> 09:35.173
<i>hiding important clues,</i>

09:35.175 --> 09:37.909
<i>Rick and Marty are more
determined than ever</i>

09:37.911 --> 09:40.145
<i>to drain it down to the botto,</i>

09:40.147 --> 09:42.981
<i>something now possible
because of an agreement</i>

09:42.983 --> 09:45.850
<i>the team reached with landowner
Fred Nolan,</i>

09:45.852 --> 09:49.654
<i>shortly before
his death earlier this year.</i>

09:49.656 --> 09:53.358
<i>But with all of the activity
now underway at The Money Pit,</i>

09:53.360 --> 09:55.794
<i>running hundreds of feet of hose</i>

09:55.796 --> 09:59.965
<i>across the island landscape is
not without its challenges.</i>

09:59.967 --> 10:01.633
<i>These hoses can't interfere</i>

10:01.635 --> 10:03.301
<i>with the big
project at the Money Pit.</i>

10:03.303 --> 10:04.903
There's gonna be trucks in and
out of there all the time,

10:04.905 --> 10:07.305
we can't just lay that hose up
to the swamp.

10:07.307 --> 10:10.041
So we decided we needed
to take an old pipe

10:10.043 --> 10:13.178
and ditch the road
and stick this old pipe in

10:13.180 --> 10:14.679
and pull the hose through it.

10:14.681 --> 10:17.015
Okay that's good.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.017
It looks good.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.389
- Yep.
- Okay, guys, hey!

10:24.391 --> 10:26.191
Let's pull this thing through.
Let's see if it works.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.359
- All right.
- Enough of this.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.296
All right!

10:33.300 --> 10:35.400
- Yeah, man!
- Yay!

10:35.402 --> 10:37.702
<i>So everything goes
relatively smoothly,</i>

10:37.704 --> 10:39.270
<i>certainly by Oak Island
standards.</i>

10:39.272 --> 10:41.406
Pipe's in.
We pull the hose through.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.742
By God, it fits.

10:43.744 --> 10:47.245
<i>We hook it up to the pump and
everything looks really good.</i>

10:47.247 --> 10:50.081
<i>We now have what's called
a dry prime pump.</i>

10:50.083 --> 10:53.318
This thing can run "dry",
if you will, for hours

10:53.320 --> 10:55.920
and hours and not harm the pump.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.122
Now that should be,
that should be all right.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.723
Well, thanks.

10:58.725 --> 11:00.892
We flip the switch.
We start the pump.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.761
It's a full go.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.996
- David!
- What?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.364
Drain the swamp!

11:22.416 --> 11:25.183
<i>At borehole C-1,
the massive Coming</i>

11:25.185 --> 11:27.886
<i>stack of 40-inch wide
steel caissons</i>

11:27.888 --> 11:30.455
<i>are only a few feet
away from reaching their</i>

11:30.457 --> 11:33.925
<i>target depth of 171 feet.</i>

11:36.096 --> 11:40.432
<i>Meanwhile, Rick, Marty and the
team are ready to begin their</i>

11:40.434 --> 11:43.134
<i>excavation of the swamp,</i>

11:43.136 --> 11:45.704
<i>where just a few weeks ago,</i>

11:45.706 --> 11:49.441
<i>they discovered a mysterious
18-foot long wooden plank,</i>

11:49.443 --> 11:52.077
<i>making the team wonder
if theories</i>

11:52.079 --> 11:56.181
<i>of a possible shipwreck buried
there could be true.</i>

11:56.183 --> 12:00.151
<i>With water successfully
diverted to the Cave-in Pit,</i>

12:00.153 --> 12:04.122
<i>the area is nearly 90% dry,</i>

12:04.124 --> 12:06.291
<i>and, for the first time
in decades,</i>

12:06.293 --> 12:08.993
<i>excavation is finally possibl.</i>

12:10.897 --> 12:12.430
Okay, I'm gonna start digging.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.199
Where's the exact dig point?
Or is there not one?

12:14.201 --> 12:15.233
It's the stake.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.237
<i>This is going to sound crazy,</i>

12:19.239 --> 12:22.273
<i>'cause I hate the swamp.
I don't like working in it.</i>

12:22.275 --> 12:25.043
But I'm very excited
to dig in the swamp.

12:25.045 --> 12:28.346
<i>I'm sitting up high and dry
in an excavator and I can't</i>

12:28.348 --> 12:31.750
<i>wait to stick that scoop down
in there and</i>

12:31.752 --> 12:34.753
pull back some of the material
and see what this is all about.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.090
That actually worked
pretty good.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.025
It's actually not as wet
as I thought it would be.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.128
No, it's dried off a bit.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.030
<i>Per the permit we have to
isolate the organic material</i>

12:46.032 --> 12:49.901
<i>from the inorganic material,
i.e. the, the liquid mud</i>

12:49.903 --> 12:51.936
<i>and the peat has to be
completely</i>

12:51.938 --> 12:54.405
<i>isolated and separated
from the hard clays,</i>

12:54.407 --> 12:56.374
<i>bits of rock material,</i>

12:56.376 --> 12:59.077
because they have to go back
in the same order they came out.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.982
Gosh! This smells rancid.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.117
<i>You cannot mix the two materials</i>

13:06.119 --> 13:10.388
<i>so basically we've created two
cattle pens for the material.</i>

13:10.390 --> 13:13.258
<i>We can finally start
excavating in the swamp.</i>

13:13.260 --> 13:15.293
<i>I think there's something
in the swamp.</i>

13:15.295 --> 13:17.162
Is it at this point?

13:17.164 --> 13:19.230
I don't know but this is a
hard target and we need to,

13:19.232 --> 13:20.592
we need to get to the bottom
of it.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.002
It's better.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.136
It's pretty solid.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.286
- Anything?
- Nothing.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.966
We should have picked it
up by now.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.502
I'm not seeing anything.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.442
How far does that thing read?

14:04.444 --> 14:05.910
About a foot down.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.549
- I'm not getting anything.
- All right,

14:11.551 --> 14:13.051
I'll tell you what would
be best:

14:13.053 --> 14:14.953
You need to pick up that
piece of plywood,

14:14.955 --> 14:16.054
I'll reach back further.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.121
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.927
Put it on top of this,
Jack, just...

14:22.929 --> 14:24.409
- Need to get back over there.
- Yeah.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.426
Is that your foot?

14:55.428 --> 14:56.995
- Yeah, what's going on there?
- No.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.267
It's kinda saying
there's something a foot down.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.301
Okay.

15:09.142 --> 15:12.176
It doesn't ever actually hit and
say this is the point, though.

15:12.178 --> 15:13.578
I understand. Just stay with it.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.079
Okay.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.619
Nothing.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.057
If there's something here,

15:26.059 --> 15:28.092
it shouldn't just be
a ghost hit.

15:28.094 --> 15:31.262
It can do that sometimes
if something's deeper.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.264
That's what I'm wondering.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.400
Like it's just picking up the
trail of it's magnetic field.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.669
All right. I'm going to dig
that out a little bit.

15:37.671 --> 15:42.073
<i>A metal target,
buried deep within the thick,</i>

15:42.075 --> 15:44.976
<i>rich mud of
the Oak Island swamp?</i>

15:44.978 --> 15:47.178
<i>Could it be connected in
some way</i>

15:47.180 --> 15:50.682
<i>to the team's earlier
discovery of a wooden plank,</i>

15:50.684 --> 15:53.551
<i>perhaps more evidence
that a sailing ship</i>

15:53.553 --> 15:55.253
<i>could have been buried
on the island,</i>

15:55.255 --> 15:56.721
<i>centuries ago?</i>

16:01.294 --> 16:03.628
<i>As Rick, Marty and the rest
of the team</i>

16:03.630 --> 16:06.431
<i>continue to dig at the swamp,</i>

16:06.433 --> 16:09.534
<i>Oak Island historian,
Charles Barkhouse,</i>

16:09.536 --> 16:11.636
<i>travels to the port town
of Lunenburg</i>

16:11.638 --> 16:14.639
<i>20 miles southwest
of the island.</i>

16:14.641 --> 16:16.374
I've arranged for us
to go down to the.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.343
South Shore Genealogical
Society.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.412
<i>With him is author and
investigative journalist,</i>

16:21.414 --> 16:24.983
<i>Randall Sullivan,
who is gathering research for</i>

16:24.985 --> 16:28.453
<i>a new book he is writing on
the Oak Island mystery.</i>

16:28.455 --> 16:31.422
They have records of a lot of
people that were on Oak Island;

16:31.424 --> 16:34.258
Maybe we can find
something that can

16:34.260 --> 16:35.727
add a little bit to the mystery,

16:35.729 --> 16:37.562
or take it away from the
mystery, I should say.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.397
I mean, even though we'll be

16:39.399 --> 16:40.732
looking at dusty old records,
it could be pretty thrilling

16:40.734 --> 16:43.134
to find certain names in there,
don't you think?

16:43.136 --> 16:46.104
You know what, I never mind
looking at dusty old records.

16:46.106 --> 16:49.273
Well, I share the same
pleasure. So, good.

16:49.275 --> 16:52.543
<i>If Randall can bring us
back a few puzzle pieces,</i>

16:52.545 --> 16:55.780
that would be fantastic.
X marks the spot would be...

16:55.782 --> 16:57.382
I guess that would be bringing
all the puzzle pieces.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.250
Exactly.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.386
He can bring all 400 in a box,
that'd be good, too.

17:01.388 --> 17:04.055
Exactly. Let's see where his
investigative nose takes him.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.790
Hello! How do you do today?

17:05.791 --> 17:07.625
I'm Randall Sullivan.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.527
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Sullivan.
- Hi, Charles Barkhouse.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.295
Hello. Stephen Ernst.

17:11.297 --> 17:12.463
Welcome to the South Shore
Genealogical Society.

17:12.464 --> 17:14.165
What can I help you with today?

17:14.166 --> 17:16.134
Well, we're actually here to
do a little research

17:16.136 --> 17:17.667
on the early families on
Oak Island.

17:17.670 --> 17:21.138
Okay, certainly. Yeah, if you'd
like to come this way.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.307
Our card catalog's here,
we have information

17:23.309 --> 17:27.045
on most of the families
of Lunenberg County.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.713
So if you want to take a look
through some of these,

17:28.715 --> 17:30.548
it should give you some
information on...

17:30.550 --> 17:32.283
- Okay.
- Do you have any early maps

17:32.285 --> 17:34.252
of Oak Island, or that area?

17:34.254 --> 17:35.486
- Absolutely.
- Really?

17:35.488 --> 17:37.155
Yeah.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.157
One moment.

17:53.239 --> 17:56.174
This is what is
known as the Church map.

17:56.176 --> 18:00.144
A.F. Church and Company was a
firm out of Bedford that was

18:00.146 --> 18:03.081
authorized to do a series
of maps of Nova Scotia,

18:03.083 --> 18:04.615
starting in 1864.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.285
And if you'd like to come right
over here.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.854
The beauty of this map is
not only does it tell you

18:09.856 --> 18:11.856
what everything is,

18:11.858 --> 18:15.226
but it also names the heads of
the eholds in each area.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.661
So when was this dating from?

18:16.663 --> 18:19.130
This one is about 1883.

18:19.132 --> 18:21.299
- A very curious map.
- Yeah, it's wonderful.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.134
- Here. Look.
- Yeah.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.735
Wow, this says
"Kidd's Treasure."

18:32.312 --> 18:33.644
Here, look.
NARRATOR-Yeah.<i> ng up...</i>

18:33.646 --> 18:35.580
That says "Kidd's Treasure."

18:35.582 --> 18:37.715
<i>At the South Shore
Genealogy Center</i>

18:37.717 --> 18:40.218
<i>in the nearby town of Lunenburg,</i>

18:40.220 --> 18:43.454
<i>Charles Barkhouse and
investigative journalist,</i>

18:43.456 --> 18:46.424
<i>Randall Sullivan,

18:46.426 --> 18:49.760
<i>important clue connecting
the Oak Island mystery</i>

18:49.762 --> 18:54.265
<i>to the 17th century pirate,
Captain William Kidd.</i>

18:54.267 --> 18:56.767
One of the things that was
kind of curious on the map

18:56.769 --> 18:58.402
is they list Kidd's Treasure.

18:58.404 --> 18:59.604
It was written in pen,
right there.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.873
Even back then,
they believed that.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.175
Captain Kidd's treasure
was buried on Oak Island.

19:04.177 --> 19:06.244
It was obviously recognized as
a treasure site

19:06.246 --> 19:07.445
by the mapmaker, even.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.382
<i>During the late 17th century,</i>

19:11.384 --> 19:13.618
<i>Captain William Kidd became</i>

19:13.620 --> 19:17.255
<i>notorious for attacking and
looting merchant ships,</i>

19:17.257 --> 19:21.292
<i>from the Caribbean Sea
to the Indian Ocean.</i>

19:21.294 --> 19:24.829
<i>In 1699, he was finally arrested</i>

19:24.831 --> 19:28.566
<i>and sent to England where
he stood trial for piracy,</i>

19:28.568 --> 19:31.802
<i>and was sentenced to death.</i>

19:31.804 --> 19:34.772
<i>Despite a desperate
plea for clemency,</i>

19:34.774 --> 19:37.742
<i>by offering to trade
his life in exchange</i>

19:37.744 --> 19:39.577
<i>for a mysterious treasure whih</i>

19:39.579 --> 19:42.480
<i>he claimed was buried
somewhere east of Boston,</i>

19:42.482 --> 19:47.618
<i>Kidd was hanged
on May 23rd, 1701.</i>

19:47.620 --> 19:51.889
<i>Is it possible that Captain
William Kidd was really the man</i>

19:51.891 --> 19:54.659
<i>behind the Oak Island mystery?</i>

19:54.661 --> 19:57.595
<i>Are the countless legends
connecting Oak Island</i>

19:57.597 --> 20:01.966
<i>to pirates and pirate gold
really true after all?</i>

20:04.237 --> 20:07.838
Very interesting how they put,
put the property owners on here.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.275
Got a Boutilier,
two McGinnis' and a Graves.

20:11.277 --> 20:13.844
So the McGinnis' stayed
on the island until...

20:15.949 --> 20:17.381
Should we take a look
at the card file?

20:17.383 --> 20:19.684
Yeah. Absolutely.
Let's take a look.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.985
You know, we were looking
in the McGinnis file

20:20.987 --> 20:22.520
for Daniel McGinnis because,

20:22.522 --> 20:23.888
you know, he's supposedly one of

20:23.890 --> 20:26.357
the original finders
of the Money Pit.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.994
Now there's various
spellings of McGinnis.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.729
Here's the McGinnis.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.930
- Here's the McGinnis.
- You got a McGinnis?

20:32.932 --> 20:34.332
Yeah.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.668
It's a book:

20:37.670 --> 20:41.572
Western Shore, Gold River,
Martins Point Communities.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.773
Let's ask him if we can take
a look at that.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.675
Yeah, I'll go up and ask him.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.677
<i>Genealogists tend to be</i>

20:46.679 --> 20:49.981
people that only put in what
they can find written,

20:49.983 --> 20:51.449
written down somewhere.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.552
There's a listing
of a book here.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.520
Wonderful. Yes, right over here.

20:56.522 --> 20:57.655
Okay.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.523
They don't make something up.

20:59.525 --> 21:02.426
It's at least something solid
to start with.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.962
Well thank you, giving me
the book.

21:04.964 --> 21:08.866
Is there a, index...
or how is it listed?

21:08.868 --> 21:10.568
Pages numbers, or...

21:10.570 --> 21:11.602
Here we are.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.839
<i>There's a story of a, this</i>

21:14.841 --> 21:16.507
<i>ancient sailor,
he's on his deathbed.</i>

21:16.509 --> 21:18.342
And he's relating this story

21:18.344 --> 21:20.544
of him being a member
of Captain Kidd's crew.

21:20.546 --> 21:24.415
It's published on
December 20th, 1863,

21:24.417 --> 21:27.318
and subsequently by a member
of the Oak Island association,

21:27.320 --> 21:29.053
who said that, more than
a century before,

21:29.055 --> 21:31.589
an old man died in what was then
known as the British...

21:31.591 --> 21:33.357
My god, I didn't realize...

21:33.359 --> 21:35.693
as the British
Colony of New England,

21:35.695 --> 21:38.496
who on his death bed confessed
to having been one of the crew

21:38.498 --> 21:41.666
of the famous Captain Kidd, and
assured those who attended him

21:41.668 --> 21:43.934
in his last moments that he
had many years previously

21:43.936 --> 21:47.772
assisted that noted pirate
and his followers in burying

21:47.774 --> 21:50.541
over two millions in money
beneath the soil of a secluded

21:50.543 --> 21:51.976
island east of Boston.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.545
<i>Two million?</i>

21:54.547 --> 21:56.747
<i>In buried treasure?</i>

21:56.749 --> 22:00.584
<i>In 1804, while digging
in the Money Pit,</i>

22:00.586 --> 22:03.621
<i>searchers from the Onslow
company found a large,</i>

22:03.623 --> 22:07.625
<i>smooth stone slab at
a depth of 90 feet.</i>

22:07.627 --> 22:10.428
<i>On it were strange
carvings which,</i>

22:10.430 --> 22:12.630
<i>when later translated, read:</i>

22:12.632 --> 22:16.967
<i>"Forty Feet Below,
Two Million Pounds Are Buried."</i>

22:16.969 --> 22:20.604
<i>Could the markings on the
so-called 90 Foot Stone be</i>

22:20.606 --> 22:25.710
<i>evidence that the old sailor's
deathbed confession was true?</i>

22:25.712 --> 22:29.380
<i>Is Captain William Kidd's
treasure really buried at</i>

22:29.382 --> 22:31.882
<i>the bottom of the Oak
Island Money Pit?</i>

22:33.820 --> 22:35.686
<i>One of the problems
with Oak Island</i>

22:35.688 --> 22:37.588
<i>from a writer,
researcher's point of view,</i>

22:37.590 --> 22:40.424
<i>is that the historical
record is scant.</i>

22:40.426 --> 22:42.593
There are bits and pieces
that you can hold on to,

22:42.595 --> 22:46.464
but it's a process of putting
pieces together and try to

22:46.466 --> 22:50.801
find out whatever I can
that'll be worth all this work.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.436
Well, I mean it's fascinating.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.472
It's, you know, and I'm glad
we made the trip,

22:54.474 --> 22:57.541
but it's like added one
more layer of what if, maybe.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.976
It's fascinating and
exasperating at the same time.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.811
- Yeah, It is.
- You know, so.

23:00.813 --> 23:03.013
I guess you got your work cut
out for you.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.950
I don't have to solve it.
I just have to tell the story.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.790
We need to see if we get
a big hit

23:12.792 --> 23:14.859
that's coming from
below that bedrock.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.427
- Yeah.
- Well let me just clean it out

23:16.429 --> 23:17.862
but you're going to need to

23:17.864 --> 23:19.430
jump right in
there 'cause it's coming...

23:19.432 --> 23:20.598
- I'm already dirty.
- Yeah, I didn't think

23:20.600 --> 23:22.099
- you'd mind.
- No.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.901
<i>While metal detecting in the mud</i>

23:23.903 --> 23:25.903
<i>of the recently drained swamp,</i>

23:25.905 --> 23:29.507
<i>Jack Begley may have
located a target,</i>

23:29.509 --> 23:32.743
<i>where, just a few weeks ago,
he and other members of</i>

23:32.745 --> 23:36.547
the Oak Island team found
a long wooden board,

23:36.549 --> 23:39.450
<i>thought to be the planking
of an ancient shipwreck.</i>

23:41.654 --> 23:43.187
All right, I got this now.

23:46.726 --> 23:50.528
<i>So we pulled a few scoops,
got Jack to metal detect that,</i>

23:50.530 --> 23:52.129
he was getting all kinds
of hits,

23:52.131 --> 23:53.998
<i>and it's like, well there's
something there.</i>

23:54.000 --> 23:56.200
<i>What is it? Any one of
those could be it,</i>

23:56.202 --> 23:58.436
<i>could be the find that
sets us on fire.</i>

24:08.581 --> 24:10.147
Well now, I'm not seeing
anything.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.984
So we're done digging.

24:13.986 --> 24:17.521
<i>Curiously, the metal
detector is no longer</i>

24:17.523 --> 24:19.557
<i>picking up the signals.</i>

24:19.559 --> 24:22.493
<i>Could it be that the target
is simply much deeper than</i>

24:22.495 --> 24:24.228
<i>the team's equipment can reac?</i>

24:24.230 --> 24:26.163
You know, if somebody buried
something in this swamp,

24:26.165 --> 24:28.165
they picked a damn good
hiding place.

24:28.167 --> 24:30.167
We might need to rethink
this whole thing.

24:30.169 --> 24:32.736
- Why?
- We haven't found anything.

24:32.738 --> 24:35.005
That's why it's a treasure hunt.

24:36.909 --> 24:39.477
<i>Of all the places on Oak Island,</i>

24:39.479 --> 24:43.080
<i>the swamp has proven to be
the most difficult to explore.</i>

24:43.082 --> 24:47.184
<i>Drilling through water and mud
is virtually impossible,</i>

24:47.186 --> 24:50.254
<i>and draining the swamp dry
has proven to be</i>

24:50.256 --> 24:54.625
<i>both logistically challenging
and hugely expensive.</i>

24:54.627 --> 24:58.195
<i>Nevertheless, the strange,
triangle-shape of the swamp,</i>

24:58.197 --> 25:00.064
<i>coupled with recent discoveries</i>

25:00.066 --> 25:02.900
<i>like the 17th century
Spanish coin,</i>

25:02.902 --> 25:05.903
<i>have made the area one
of Rick and Marty Lagina's</i>

25:05.905 --> 25:10.107
<i>most intriguing, as well as
frustrating, target sites.</i>

25:10.109 --> 25:11.242
<i>It's disappointing, you know,</i>

25:11.244 --> 25:13.210
<i>we haven't found anything.</i>

25:13.212 --> 25:17.815
But the swamp still intrigues me
and I'm not done with it yet.

25:17.817 --> 25:20.918
The truth is, we went
with that EM-61

25:20.920 --> 25:23.287
because, for depth penetration.

25:23.289 --> 25:28.158
Maybe we bring the more accurate
one back for a couple hours.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.860
It may be worth it.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.795
Okay, that's where I think
the decision is.

25:31.797 --> 25:35.099
Either we, we have somebody come
out and look at this area again,

25:35.101 --> 25:36.800
or we continue with the process.

25:36.802 --> 25:38.536
I think, I think we should,
we should run

25:38.538 --> 25:40.738
another piece of gear for
a couple hours.

25:40.740 --> 25:43.173
- Yeah, get 'em out here.
- Fine. I'll call

25:43.175 --> 25:45.276
Gary Drayton and see if he can't
come out tonight.

25:45.278 --> 25:46.277
You should probably go out
in the ocean.

25:46.279 --> 25:47.878
I'd love to get cleaned up.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.613
I can feel stuff crawling
around on me.

25:49.615 --> 25:51.916
- Okay. Let's go, let's do it.
- Awesome.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.217
I'll... I'll make the call.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.927
<i>As a new day begins</i>
NAR <i> on Oak Island...</i>

26:02.929 --> 26:05.696
- Morning!
- Morning, Andrew.

26:05.698 --> 26:09.199
<i>The team assembles at the
Money Pit to get an update on</i>

26:09.201 --> 26:12.303
<i>the excavation of borehole C-.</i>

26:12.305 --> 26:14.605
We're not making much headway,
are we?

26:14.607 --> 26:17.207
Right now we're on something
very, very solid.

26:17.209 --> 26:20.144
Chisels not advancing it.

26:20.146 --> 26:22.580
The oscillators not advancing
it, nor is the hammer grab.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.248
- So...
- What do you think it is?

26:24.250 --> 26:27.918
It's, it's, either a very,
very hard boulder,

26:27.920 --> 26:31.322
like a granite boulder,
or it's solid rock.

26:31.324 --> 26:33.757
The boulder's big enough,
if it is a boulder,

26:33.759 --> 26:35.659
that it's not going
inside the can.

26:35.661 --> 26:37.161
- Yeah.
- And we're not fortunate

26:37.163 --> 26:39.196
enough to just go in and
pluck it out.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.898
- So...
- It's bigger than the can.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.800
Yeah. I'm gonna go back
over here and we're gonna

26:42.802 --> 26:45.035
start throwing drill rod in
and we'll sees you in a bit.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.070
- Yeah, okay.
- Thanks for the update.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.871
See you, guys.

26:47.873 --> 26:49.807
<i>This hole is a lot different</i>

26:49.809 --> 26:51.342
<i>in terms of how we need to
structure it</i>

26:51.344 --> 26:54.778
than the first one because,
we know the chamber,

26:54.780 --> 26:56.313
the ultimate objective here,
is in bedrock.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.182
Hey, boss!

26:58.184 --> 27:00.918
<i>So we can't just
keep going because</i>

27:00.920 --> 27:03.020
<i>when it gets into that chamber,
there's nothing to hold it.</i>

27:03.022 --> 27:05.089
It could just keep going.

27:05.091 --> 27:07.992
<i>So the plan right now is to
stop in the bedrock and then</i>

27:07.994 --> 27:10.034
<i>we'll drill out and get into
the chamber that way.</i>

27:11.864 --> 27:14.632
<i>Because the stacked
caissons in C-1,</i>

27:14.634 --> 27:17.401
<i>weigh in excess of 60 tons,</i>

27:17.403 --> 27:20.304
<i>the team from Irving
Equipment Limited must now</i>

27:20.306 --> 27:24.074
<i>cease drilling at a depth of
160 feet,</i>

27:24.076 --> 27:27.144
<i>just shy of the 21-foot
deep void they</i>

27:27.146 --> 27:28.779
<i>encountered last year.</i>

27:30.016 --> 27:32.182
Once firmly anchored in bedrock,

27:32.184 --> 27:36.720
a 39-inch drill bit will be used
to grind through the remaining

27:36.722 --> 27:41.258
10 to 20 feet to create a stable
entrance into the cavity below

27:41.260 --> 27:44.328
and allow for safe,
human exploration.

27:45.297 --> 27:46.897
Here we go.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.265
Okay, get after it.

27:52.038 --> 27:54.738
- Big dog two.
- Yeah.

27:54.740 --> 27:57.441
That's big stuff. I gotta admit,
I'm impressed with that.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.411
It is huge.

28:00.413 --> 28:03.013
So Charles, as soon as that
drops in,

28:03.015 --> 28:05.315
you're 15 feet away from
the void.

28:05.317 --> 28:06.850
How do you feel?

28:06.852 --> 28:08.252
I just hope there's something
there.

28:09.722 --> 28:12.690
- Hey, Andrew.
- Gentlemen.

28:12.692 --> 28:16.694
So we got 173 feet of string
in the casing right now.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.129
We're going to lift the lead up,
hook it up.

28:19.131 --> 28:21.265
And then you're ready to let
the big dog eat.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.233
Yep. Yep.

28:23.235 --> 28:26.904
<i>The prospect of
excavating borehole C-1</i>

28:26.906 --> 28:28.839
<i>to a diameter large enough</i>

28:28.841 --> 28:31.875
<i>for human exploration, has
the team filled with both</i>

28:31.877 --> 28:35.045
<i>excitement and anticipation.</i>

28:35.047 --> 28:37.314
<i>It is now just a matter of hours</i>

28:37.316 --> 28:39.783
<i>before they reach
the strange void</i>

28:39.785 --> 28:43.120
<i>in the bedrock
some 170 feet deep</i>

28:43.122 --> 28:45.322
<i>to confirm what the
gold-colored object</i>

28:45.324 --> 28:46.824
<i>might really be.</i>

28:51.797 --> 28:54.198
Excavation has been removed so

28:54.200 --> 28:56.233
we'd like you to go through
those spoils piles as well,

28:56.235 --> 28:59.169
but here's the current
condition of the swamp.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.904
<i>While the drilling operation</i>

29:00.906 --> 29:03.907
<i>at the Money Pit continues...</i>

29:03.909 --> 29:05.776
Okay, let's get you out there.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.911
<i>Rick and the team have brought</i>

29:07.913 --> 29:10.047
<i>metal detection expert,
Gary Drayton,</i>

29:10.049 --> 29:11.815
<i>out to the swamp.</i>

29:11.817 --> 29:14.251
Wow, you weren't joking
when you said it was dry.

29:14.253 --> 29:17.054
- It's dry. It's dry.
- That's fantastic.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.956
<i>They are hoping that someone</i>

29:18.958 --> 29:21.458
<i>of Gary's extensive experience</i>

29:21.460 --> 29:25.062
<i>will succeed in locating the
elusive metal object that.</i>

29:25.064 --> 29:27.865
<i>Jack's equipment
was unable to reach.</i>

29:27.867 --> 29:31.769
I can't speak highly enough
about Gary as an individual,

29:31.771 --> 29:34.271
and his skill set as
a metal detectorist.

29:34.273 --> 29:37.241
He's back to try to
locate something in

29:37.243 --> 29:39.409
the swamp and I know that if
there's something to be

29:39.411 --> 29:41.044
found in there Gary can find it.

29:41.046 --> 29:42.813
Rick, if we find
anything important

29:42.815 --> 29:44.014
we'll give
you a call right away.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.115
- Perfect.
- Well, you might hear

29:45.117 --> 29:47.151
a scream too but...

29:47.153 --> 29:49.153
I don't care, scream or phone
call, you just make it happen.

29:49.155 --> 29:52.856
And you'll see me dancing.
That's my gold dance.

29:52.858 --> 29:54.124
I love it.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.960
Where, where at?

29:56.962 --> 29:58.529
I would put the boards
over there.

29:58.531 --> 30:00.998
Because obviously I've got to
get in there.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.099
Okay.

30:04.170 --> 30:08.372
No signals yet.
Come on gold, where are you?

30:08.374 --> 30:10.440
I just want to try up in here,
this...

30:12.278 --> 30:14.178
You're going everywhere where
we're not plying, Gary.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.914
Yeah, I know. But I don't want
to walk away from here and leave

30:16.916 --> 30:18.081
these little nooks and crannies.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.516
No, be thorough about it.

30:19.518 --> 30:21.151
This is one of the few chances
we'll get.

30:21.153 --> 30:24.221
Exactly, that's what
I'm thinking.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.923
<i>Because draining the swamp</i>

30:25.925 --> 30:27.891
<i>has always been difficult,</i>

30:27.893 --> 30:31.061
<i>owing to the need to obtain
permissions from both</i>

30:31.063 --> 30:34.131
<i>landowner Fred Nolan and
the Canadian government,</i>

30:34.133 --> 30:36.099
<i>the fact that the swamp is now</i>

30:36.101 --> 30:38.869
<i>almost completely
drained offers a rare,</i>

30:38.871 --> 30:41.839
<i>but time sensitive, opportunity.</i>

30:41.841 --> 30:45.843
<i>The Laginas and their partners
have only a few more weeks to</i>

30:45.845 --> 30:49.379
<i>search the swamp for possible
artifacts or clues that could</i>

30:49.381 --> 30:51.181
<i>help them solve the mystery.</i>

30:52.384 --> 30:54.618
It's always in the swamp.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.453
Well, I'd like to agree,

30:56.455 --> 30:59.056
but we need more evidence
if we want to continue here.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.260
<i>Suddenly...</i>

31:03.262 --> 31:05.629
Oooh! Now that's a good signal.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.567
And it's under...
It's underneath the board.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.402
- Here.
- Thanks.

31:15.174 --> 31:17.341
That's what we're waiting for.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.409
- Good signal.
- Really?

31:20.579 --> 31:22.379
I'll just dig a bunch of dirt.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.501
Yeah, just... Yep, just dig it
up. It's not that deep.

31:27.920 --> 31:31.922
It says it's 6-7 inches so we
should have it in one scoop.

31:31.924 --> 31:34.024
Please be something good.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.526
Okay, I'll give it a little
test.

31:41.166 --> 31:43.100
- All right!
- It's somewhere around there.

31:43.102 --> 31:44.167
So we got it out of there.

31:50.075 --> 31:51.075
- Yeah.
- Look at that!

31:56.582 --> 31:58.348
All right!

31:58.350 --> 32:00.250
It's somewhere around there.

32:05.391 --> 32:08.659
- Yeah.
- Look at that, that's nice!

32:08.661 --> 32:11.461

32:28.547 --> 32:30.447
for putting decks down,

32:30.449 --> 32:34.318
thick decking, on the old boats.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.019
You see the size of the head?

32:36.021 --> 32:38.488
That was so the planks
couldn't come up.

32:38.490 --> 32:42.592
Well, the board that Tony found
in the south part of the swamp

32:42.594 --> 32:44.962
looked like decking.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.630
It probably is.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.499
It was very long and didn't seem

32:49.501 --> 32:51.435
even close to thick enough to be

32:51.437 --> 32:54.037
a part of of the outside of the
ship, the hull.

32:54.039 --> 32:56.974
If you guys have found some,
like, wooden decking,

32:56.976 --> 33:00.277
this is exactly the type of
handmade nail that they would

33:00.279 --> 33:02.479
have put into decking
to hold decking down.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.714
Look at it, I mean it's...

33:03.716 --> 33:05.649
- Yeah.
- That's a beautiful thing.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.551
So does this mean we actually
found something in the swamp?

33:07.553 --> 33:11.555
Yeah, I think this is
an artifact, for sure.

33:11.557 --> 33:14.624
I found exactly
the same objects as this on,

33:14.626 --> 33:19.763
off Spanish galleons from the
late 1600s, early 1700s.

33:19.765 --> 33:23.500
<i>An artifact from
a Spanish Galleon?</i>

33:23.502 --> 33:27.170
<i>Could it be connected
in some way to the 18 foot long</i>

33:27.172 --> 33:29.272
<i>plank found a few weeks ago...</i>

33:29.274 --> 33:31.241
It's a large board.

33:31.243 --> 33:33.276
<i>And which was thought to be
part of the deck from</i>

33:33.278 --> 33:35.178
<i>an old sailing ship?</i>

33:35.180 --> 33:38.015
<i>Veteran Oak Island researchers
and treasure hunters</i>

33:38.017 --> 33:40.751
<i>like Fred Nolan have long
believed that</i>

33:40.753 --> 33:43.220
<i>the mysterious triangle-shaped
swamp</i>

33:43.222 --> 33:44.755
<i>could have been
deliberately created</i>

33:44.757 --> 33:48.592
<i>centuries ago to hide an old
shipwreck.</i>

33:48.594 --> 33:53.530
<i>If so, who would have hidden
it? Spanish Pirates?</i>

33:53.532 --> 33:57.367
<i>Or might it be further evidence
that supports Randall Sullivan</i>

33:57.369 --> 34:00.370
<i>and Charles Barkhouse's
research suggesting</i>

34:00.372 --> 34:03.173
<i>that Captain William Kidd
really did</i>

34:03.175 --> 34:06.710
<i>bury a valuable
treasure on Oak Island?</i>

34:06.712 --> 34:08.445
For me, this is one of
the coolest things

34:08.447 --> 34:09.478
we've found out here.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.514
It's a fantastic find.

34:11.516 --> 34:12.449
- Yeah, it is.
- And there's probably...

34:12.451 --> 34:14.518
Hey, and you found it!

34:14.520 --> 34:17.654
<i>Gary's excitement, I mean,
this guy has done this a lot,</i>

34:17.656 --> 34:19.523
<i>and one of the things
that he looks for</i>

34:19.525 --> 34:21.425
<i>in Florida are
Spanish shipwrecks.</i>

34:21.427 --> 34:23.460
<i>So, he has found a lot of
these pins,</i>

34:23.462 --> 34:25.594
and he was really excited
about this.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.831
He seems to sincerely,
100% believe

34:27.833 --> 34:29.433
that this is from an old ship.

34:29.435 --> 34:32.268
We're the first people
to touch that

34:32.271 --> 34:34.804
in probably 300 years.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.273
- That's pretty cool.
- What?!

34:36.275 --> 34:38.775
Well, let's see,

34:38.777 --> 34:41.511
let's do a spiral pattern around
here and see if there's anymore.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.112
- Okay.
- That's sweet.

34:43.114 --> 34:45.449
At least we found something.
That's cool.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.184
Bag it and tag it.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.857
<i>After a day full of
hopeful anticipation</i>

34:53.859 --> 34:56.159
<i>at the Money Pit,</i>

34:56.161 --> 34:59.796
<i>and a potentially important
breakthrough in the swamp...</i>

34:59.798 --> 35:01.665
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.668
<i>Rick, Marty and other
members of the Oak Island team</i>

35:04.670 --> 35:07.471
<i>have gathered at the nearby
Fo'c'sle Tavern.</i>

35:07.473 --> 35:11.241
A well deserved rest,
if I do say so myself.

35:11.243 --> 35:13.543
Well, a little bit of business,
too.

35:13.545 --> 35:16.313
Any results from Gary Drayton?

35:16.315 --> 35:18.849
Yeah, I mean look, they, they've
made significant progress,

35:18.851 --> 35:21.651
specifically in the Swamp;
I think Alex, you were there,

35:21.653 --> 35:23.753
and Jack, you were there, so...

35:23.755 --> 35:26.423
I know a little bit about
the finds but you found one

35:26.425 --> 35:28.158
curious thing for certain.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.559
Yeah, we found some cool stuff.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.261
Jack, you can kind of
talk about it.

35:31.263 --> 35:34.598
The most interesting
was a spike.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.434
It looked like a railroad
tie at first and my

35:37.436 --> 35:39.202
first assumption was
looking back...

35:39.204 --> 35:41.838
A railroad tie, you mean
a railroad tie spike?

35:41.840 --> 35:43.807
- Yeah, a railroad tie spike.
- Okay.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.542
Then Gary pointed out, "Hey",

35:45.544 --> 35:47.744
I've found hundreds
of these before.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.413
This is from a Spanish Galleon
and it's used to pin...

35:50.415 --> 35:51.915
- Really?
- The top decking down

35:51.917 --> 35:53.717
on their boats."
He said, you know

35:53.719 --> 35:55.485
you can tell the
differences cause they're

35:55.487 --> 35:58.321
not like a normal railroad
spike because they're a lot

35:58.323 --> 36:00.557
shorter and also,

36:00.559 --> 36:02.792
on the very end,
with a railroad spike,

36:02.794 --> 36:05.162
it has another spike sticking
out from it.

36:05.164 --> 36:07.731
Yeah, to get another, more grip.

36:07.733 --> 36:09.432
And this didn't have that.

36:09.434 --> 36:10.901
Where was that found?

36:10.903 --> 36:12.602
It was towards the north end
of the Swamp.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.738
It's bagged and tagged,
as you say.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.640
- Yeah.
- So, we can show it to you.

36:16.642 --> 36:19.543
Ask Gary.

36:19.545 --> 36:23.914
He must have sourced someone who
could say definitively this is

36:23.916 --> 36:26.917
from nailing the deck
boards on an old ship.

36:26.919 --> 36:29.719
I'm sure there's a,
you know, spike expert.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.555
Let's find this person.

36:31.557 --> 36:33.623
Look it's a weird thing to
find there no matter what.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.826
Yeah. C-1, everything's
going well?

36:36.828 --> 36:38.862
So far. I hope we're going to
find that shiny gold thing

36:38.864 --> 36:40.697
that David saw on the monitor.

36:40.699 --> 36:43.900
Is it gold? I had, that I have
no idea but it was a shiny

36:43.902 --> 36:47.270
gold thing about like that,
that tall.

36:47.272 --> 36:50.273
The only, the real concern is
as we come through the cavity,

36:50.275 --> 36:52.943
what happens to the ceiling,
the roof?

36:52.945 --> 36:56.513
Surely there's going to be
some fall.

36:56.515 --> 36:57.981
- So...
- That's unavoidable.

36:57.983 --> 37:00.283
The last bit's gonna, you know,
cave in.

37:00.285 --> 37:03.553
- The bit is very heavy.
- So Andrew has agreed that,

37:03.555 --> 37:05.522
generally speaking,
they never do this;

37:05.524 --> 37:07.958
They never put the hammer grab
well beyond the hole.

37:07.960 --> 37:10.493
Well, he's agreed to do
that cause we think

37:10.495 --> 37:12.729
the bottom's 21 feet.

37:12.731 --> 37:15.298
- So, but he's willing...
- So you just go down,

37:15.300 --> 37:17.534
whatever you knocked to bottom
you go down and grab.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.836
Exactly, because if
that object is in there

37:19.838 --> 37:22.305
- and that collapse happens...
- We want it.

37:22.307 --> 37:24.007
- That's right! We definitely do.
- Yeah.

37:24.009 --> 37:26.509
- We'll find it.
- Yep.

37:26.511 --> 37:28.378
Okay, well here's to that.
That's exciting.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.614
Let's drink
to the gold shiny thing.

37:30.616 --> 37:33.316
Shiny gold thing.
Shiny gold thing.

37:33.318 --> 37:34.584
I'll drink to that, you David?

37:34.586 --> 37:35.752
Definitely.

37:42.661 --> 37:45.595
<i>As a new day dawns
on Oak Island,</i>

37:45.597 --> 37:49.299
<i>Rick Lagina and
Charles Barkhouse are excited</i>

37:49.301 --> 37:51.801
<i>to learn that the massive
steel drill is just</i>

37:51.803 --> 37:54.004
<i>inches away from reaching
its target depth</i>

37:54.006 --> 37:56.373
<i>at borehole C-1.</i>

37:56.375 --> 37:57.807
- Gentlemen, how are ya?
- Good.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.676
- Good, how are you?
- Good, good.

37:59.678 --> 38:02.312
<i>This is the same place where,
just last summer,</i>

38:02.314 --> 38:06.416
<i>the two spotted what appeared
to be a shiny golden object</i>

38:06.418 --> 38:09.753
<i>embedded in the walls
of an underground cavern.</i>

38:09.755 --> 38:12.555
We're monitoring the weight
on the bit right now.

38:12.557 --> 38:16.426
We've backed everything off,
so I expect that the bottom

38:16.428 --> 38:18.328
twelve inches or maybe
a little more,

38:18.330 --> 38:20.030
might just fall away abruptly.

38:20.032 --> 38:21.998
Might go down about an inch
or two,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.567
I don't anticipate that it'll
be any more than that.

38:24.569 --> 38:27.003
That'll mean we've penetrated
through something soft,

38:27.005 --> 38:28.905
very soft.

38:28.907 --> 38:31.374
Whether you believe it or not,
Charles can attest,

38:31.376 --> 38:33.543
it's historically significant,
right, Charles?

38:33.545 --> 38:35.945
It is. You pull something out of
there, that's the,

38:35.947 --> 38:37.847
that's the first thing that's
come out of that Money Pit.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.616
I mean, you'd go down
in history.

38:39.618 --> 38:43.653
That is a major turning point
in Oak Island.

38:43.655 --> 38:46.790
Six people have lost their lives
on this island,

38:46.792 --> 38:50.794
trying to do what you may
be able to do this afternoon.

38:50.796 --> 38:53.363
What we may be able to do
this afternoon. That's great.

38:53.365 --> 38:54.931
- Yeah, we. We.
- That's great.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.366
All right.
I'll see you guys in a bit.

38:56.368 --> 38:58.068
- Thanks, Andrew.
- Okay.

38:58.070 --> 39:00.337
<i>Today is a pretty exciting
day on Oak Island.</i>

39:00.339 --> 39:03.473
We're going to break through
the ceiling of C-1

39:03.475 --> 39:06.042
and finally be able
to investigate it properly.

39:06.044 --> 39:08.611
<i>We can put a sonar down.</i>

39:08.613 --> 39:09.746
<i>We can put a camera down.</i>

39:09.748 --> 39:11.548
<i>We can airlift the void.</i>

39:11.550 --> 39:13.850
<i>We can get a diver to go down.</i>

39:13.852 --> 39:16.820
We've gone from putting
a little tiny sewer camera down

39:16.822 --> 39:19.789
to now possibly getting
a man down hole.

39:19.791 --> 39:23.059
<i>We know that it can be explored.</i>

39:23.061 --> 39:25.929
<i>Key question is,
is there a tunnel?</i>

39:25.931 --> 39:28.732
Is there a connection to perhaps
the original Money Pit?

39:28.734 --> 39:29.933
That's the answer I want.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.636
Did it go through?

39:33.638 --> 39:35.398
They're lowering it right now,
there they go.

39:40.412 --> 39:42.779
There it goes.

39:42.781 --> 39:43.980
Boy, she's rocking.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.448
Jumping around now.

39:45.450 --> 39:46.549
Jumping.

39:49.087 --> 39:50.887
That big chunk of gold,

39:50.889 --> 39:52.389
she's having a hard
time getting through, Charles.

39:52.391 --> 39:53.790
I hope you're right.

39:57.429 --> 39:59.229
- Whoa, there she is locking up.
- Whoa, whoa.

40:00.699 --> 40:02.565
Really torque up on it.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.134
Yeah, I think it dropped a few
inches right there.

40:04.136 --> 40:06.469
Yeah, yeah, it did.

40:06.471 --> 40:09.939
Yeah, it looked like it might
have just broke through.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.775
She dropped, it's gotta be
through.

40:11.777 --> 40:14.911
And smooth, so it's definitely
inside the cavity.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.417
Here you go, the door's open!

40:20.419 --> 40:22.886
I think we got a pretty
clear unobstructed hole,

40:22.888 --> 40:24.721
the whole way through.

40:24.723 --> 40:26.489
- Okay, we're home.
- Yeah.

40:28.627 --> 40:31.161
<i>After more than
a decade of searching,</i>

40:31.163 --> 40:34.831
<i>and after spending millions
of hard-earned dollars,</i>

40:34.833 --> 40:37.867
<i>Rick, Marty and their
partners may be close to</i>

40:37.869 --> 40:41.604
<i>realizing yet another
incredible goal.</i>

40:41.606 --> 40:44.674
Charles, he just said,
the door's open.

40:44.676 --> 40:47.744
- How do you feel?
- Excited.

40:47.746 --> 40:50.947
- Anxious.
- Then here, here's the thing is,

40:50.949 --> 40:52.816
whatever that object was,

40:52.818 --> 40:54.884
it's now resting on the bottom.

40:54.886 --> 40:59.589
I mean we're within a, you know,
192 feet of grabbing it.

40:59.591 --> 41:02.725
<i>The team has finally reached</i>

41:02.727 --> 41:04.761
<i>the 21-foot deep void</i>

41:04.763 --> 41:09.532
<i>located some 170 feet
deep below Oak Island.</i>

41:09.534 --> 41:11.801
<i>But what will they find?</i>

41:11.803 --> 41:14.938
<i>A golden treasure
buried by pirates?</i>

41:14.940 --> 41:16.706
<i>Priceless artifacts,</i>

41:16.708 --> 41:20.543
<i>hidden centuries ago
by the Knights Templar?</i>

41:20.545 --> 41:24.047
<i>Or could it be a key...</i>

41:24.049 --> 41:27.116
<i>one that will unlock
the door to a mystery</i>

41:27.118 --> 41:29.719
<i>that was intended
to remain closed...</i>

41:29.721 --> 41:31.054
<i>forever?</i>

41:35.694 --> 41:38.127
<i>Next time on</i> The Curse
of Oak Island...

41:38.129 --> 41:39.896
- Ho-ho!
- Is that a coin?

41:39.898 --> 41:41.664
- That's a king jewel.
- That's amazing.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.233
This is a treasure hunter's
dream.

41:43.235 --> 41:45.902
That changes a lot.
They're not supposed to be here.

41:45.904 --> 41:48.538
The people who did this
wanted it to be found.

41:48.540 --> 41:51.241
- Take it slow.
- The world hasn't seen this.

41:51.243 --> 41:52.742
Hey, what's that
gold shiny thing right there?

41:52.744 --> 41:54.177
Holy smokes.

41:54.179 --> 41:55.778
That's amazing looking.

41:55.780 --> 41:56.913
Here we go.

41:56.915 --> 41:58.515
My hope as I'm watching,

41:58.517 --> 42:00.650
is just show me one
man made object.

42:00.652 --> 42:02.018
- What's that?
- Wow!

42:02.020 --> 42:03.119
That's amazing.
