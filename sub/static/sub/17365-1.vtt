00:11.980 --> 00:15.020
Tonight - James gets lost in a Lamborghini.

00:15.590 --> 00:18.180
Richard drives over a bridge in a Ferrari.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.100
And I wear a small hat in an Aston Martin.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074

00:30.660 --> 00:32.600
Hello! Thank you!

00:33.210 --> 00:34.880
Thank you very much, thank you.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.400
We're back! We're back.

00:38.300 --> 00:42.240
And while we were off air, the three of us had a bit of an argument

00:42.240 --> 00:47.120
about what would be the best car to take on a Grand Tour of Europe.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.800
I reckon, and I'm right,

00:48.800 --> 00:51.860
it's the Aston Martin DBS Volante.

00:51.860 --> 00:53.700
Richard says, no, it isn't,

00:53.700 --> 00:56.350
it's the Ferrari California,

00:56.350 --> 00:59.250
and James - who's a bit weird -

00:59.250 --> 01:04.900
says it's the Lamborghini Gallardo, the new one with the 560-horsepower engine.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.020
Well, it is.

01:06.020 --> 01:07.060
No, it isn't!

01:07.060 --> 01:11.370
What that is is a two-seater, mid-engine, 560-horsepower supercar.

01:11.370 --> 01:14.180
What you want for a Grand Tour is engine at the front,

01:14.180 --> 01:17.340
nice comfy suspension,four seats and a boot for all your luggage.

01:17.340 --> 01:18.950
Exactly, like the Aston.

01:19.630 --> 01:24.620
Well, yeah, it's the best apart from the fact that the Ferrari costs GBP140,000,

01:24.620 --> 01:28.300
the Lambo GBP150,000 and the Aston is the best part of GBP170,000.

01:28.300 --> 01:29.440
Yes.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.070
And it's the slowest to 60mph.

01:31.070 --> 01:31.870
Yes.

01:31.880 --> 01:32.880
And it's got the smallest top speed.

01:32.880 --> 01:36.440
Yes. But...That's a V8, that's a V10,

01:36.440 --> 01:40.030
that's a V12. More is better.

01:40.890 --> 01:42.520
No! It is.

01:42.520 --> 01:43.320
Isn't.It is.

01:43.320 --> 01:43.420
It isn't.

01:43.420 --> 01:44.710
I'll hold my breath.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.700
He is now holding his breath.

01:48.420 --> 01:51.030
Anyway. The producers said that the only real way to sort this out

01:51.030 --> 01:54.110
was to take these cars on an actual Grand Tour.

01:54.110 --> 01:56.440
So we thought, "Yes! South of France,

01:56.440 --> 01:58.780
or Italy,or the Black Forest."

01:58.780 --> 02:03.270
But then they said no. They said that we had to take them...to Romania.

02:07.480 --> 02:10.919
This is what springs to mind when we think about Romania.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.530
Not that we do very often.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.160
We imagine it's full of oxes and

02:16.160 --> 02:18.870
people throwing stones at gypsies.

02:24.870 --> 02:30.110
So you'd imagine that turning up in cars like this might look like showing off.

02:30.110 --> 02:31.600
We did, too.

02:32.380 --> 02:37.060
Coming here in a car that costs GBP168,000

02:37.060 --> 02:39.960
is a bit like turning up in the Sudan in a suit

02:39.960 --> 02:42.050
made entirely out of food.

02:43.540 --> 02:46.790
'But then we arrived in the Black Sea town of Mamaia.

02:43.790 --> 02:47.400
{\a6}{\fn??????}{\c&HFFDC35&\fs16} 

02:47.400 --> 02:49.950
'And it wasn't really what we were expecting.'

02:52.150 --> 02:54.120
My God!

02:57.790 --> 03:01.040
Jag. Porsche. Ferrari. Ferrari.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.170
Audi R8 V10. Another Ferrari.

03:04.460 --> 03:07.370
If Simon Cowell came here they'd put him on income support.

03:07.370 --> 03:08.450
Look at it!

03:08.450 --> 03:12.030
That's a 430. That's a 599.

03:12.030 --> 03:17.350
OK. We're not as conspicuous as I first feared.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.250
Have you ever seen the like, Hammond?

03:19.250 --> 03:20.930
No, it's staggering!

03:20.930 --> 03:24.250
'And then, just when we thought the car park couldn't get any better...'

03:24.990 --> 03:27.750
Oh my God! That is, isn't it?

03:27.750 --> 03:29.360
It is a Dacia Sandero.

03:29.940 --> 03:30.760
That is it.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.130
I think this is the 1.6.

03:32.130 --> 03:33.420
I think it is the 1.6.

03:33.420 --> 03:36.610
I forgot that this is where the Sandero is from.

03:36.610 --> 03:38.700
I've been thinking about that car for two years.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.700
'Sadly, before he could think about it any more,

03:41.700 --> 03:43.760
'a challenge arrived.'

03:44.360 --> 03:48.250
"You are here to seek out a road "built by a former dictator.

03:48.250 --> 03:52.250
"Officially it's called the Transf... Transfi..."

03:52.880 --> 03:53.400
That. Trans...

03:53.400 --> 03:54.870
Transfgs...

03:54.870 --> 03:57.780
"..Transfagarasan Highway.

03:57.780 --> 04:00.350
Unofficially it's known as Ceausescu's Folly.

04:00.620 --> 04:02.750
"People speak of it in hushed whispers.

04:02.750 --> 04:06.090
"They say it's the best road in the world."

04:06.090 --> 04:07.860
So we're here to look for it.

04:07.860 --> 04:09.110
We've got to find it.

04:11.600 --> 04:16.360
We decided to look in the mountains,which were 300 miles away.

04:16.360 --> 04:21.140
And on the journey, each of us would hope to prove our car was best.

04:22.940 --> 04:26.410
Yes, if you used facts and figures

04:26.410 --> 04:30.370
when buying a car, you probably would end up with the Lamborghini or the Ferrari,

04:30.370 --> 04:34.410
in the same way that if you used facts and figures to buy a house,

04:34.410 --> 04:36.210
you'd end up in Dunfermline.

04:36.210 --> 04:37.990
Because you get a lot more for your money.

04:40.840 --> 04:43.340
This is a whole new type of car for Ferrari.

04:44.190 --> 04:46.770
This is the first with the V8 engine in the front.

04:46.770 --> 04:49.550
It's the first direct injection engine they've produced,

04:49.550 --> 04:52.390
it's the first Ferrari with a metal folding roof.

04:52.390 --> 04:56.170
This is the first time Ferrari have produced a car with a DSG gearbox

04:56.170 --> 04:59.740
which means you get absolutely seamless gear changes.

05:02.890 --> 05:04.570
This isn't a Ferrari for the track,

05:05.340 --> 05:08.430
it's for long journeys exactly like this one.

05:10.490 --> 05:12.850
'And now James had the chance to explain

05:12.850 --> 05:17.510
"why he brought a mid-engine two-seater supercar on a Grand Tour.'

05:18.330 --> 05:23.380
By driving around in a Lamborghini,you are actually doing the world a favour.

05:23.380 --> 05:27.630
Because it's a thing of beauty,other people can look at it and they can enjoy it.

05:27.630 --> 05:30.000
It's like owning one of Raphael's virgins

05:30.000 --> 05:32.340
and running around the streets holding it above your head

05:32.340 --> 05:33.900
rather than just putting it on the wall.

05:35.730 --> 05:38.620
'So that we could talk to each other on our long journey,

05:38.620 --> 05:42.760
'we decided to pull over and connect our phones into the cars' Bluetooth systems.

05:44.020 --> 05:47.160
'In the Aston and the Lamborghini,this was very easy.'

05:48.060 --> 05:49.300
Bluetooth, on.

05:49.300 --> 05:50.760
Press enter to continue.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.750
Bluetooth on the phone.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.970
'However, in the Ferrari...'

05:54.970 --> 05:58.430
'Every new phone must be prepared before it is used.'

05:58.430 --> 05:59.410
Yes, preparing my phone.

05:59.410 --> 06:00.710
'You may have...'

06:00.710 --> 06:01.650
Yes, yes, yes.

06:01.650 --> 06:05.700
'..so that you can press the phone's button and say "Call Mary"

06:05.700 --> 06:08.190
to place a call to Mary.

06:08.190 --> 06:10.690
'Pressing the VR button while the system is speaking...'

06:10.690 --> 06:12.970
Please stop!

06:12.970 --> 06:15.300
Synchronising...yes!

06:15.300 --> 06:18.160
I'm there! I'm connected! I'm Bluetoothed!

06:18.160 --> 06:20.470
Bluetooth switched on. Oh, joy.

06:20.470 --> 06:23.300
'..Home, work, mobile or pager.'

06:24.030 --> 06:25.590
Work! I'm at work!

06:25.590 --> 06:27.200
'Name, please.'

06:27.200 --> 06:29.250
Richard! How does that help?!

06:30.340 --> 06:32.370
'Please repeat the name after the beep.'

06:34.040 --> 06:37.720
'With our phones connected -eventually - we put our roofs up,

06:37.720 --> 06:40.870
'which, without wishing to boast,you can do on the move in the Aston,

06:40.870 --> 06:45.170
'and then we were ready for a motorway blast to Bucharest.'

06:52.360 --> 06:54.480
Oh! There's the V12!

06:56.010 --> 06:58.530
"1  2  5  0  8
'1, 2, 5, 0, 8...'

06:58.530 --> 06:59.250
What?!

06:59.250 --> 07:04.530
"...0  2  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1
'..0, 2, 0, 0, 0,'0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1...'

07:04.530 --> 07:05.890
CLEAR!

07:11.230 --> 07:13.840
'Then we did what we weren't supposed to do.'

07:14.520 --> 07:18.780
In 3, 2, 1, go!

07:20.800 --> 07:22.590
Oh, yeah, this is what we mustn't do.

07:31.180 --> 07:33.930
It just has the legs, that Ferrari.

07:34.940 --> 07:37.250
Just, just, just.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.810
Yeah, this might be a GT car,but it's...

07:40.640 --> 07:41.900
It's not a slouch.

07:42.850 --> 07:45.850
Aston Martin has gone to simply enormous lengths

07:46.510 --> 07:48.850
to make the DVS convertible as light as possible.

07:48.850 --> 07:51.110
It has a carbon-fibre bonnet,

07:51.110 --> 07:52.310
carbon-fibre wings,

07:52.310 --> 07:53.810
carbon-fibre boot,

07:53.810 --> 07:55.740
carbon-fibre door-pulls, even.

07:55.740 --> 08:00.500
They've even made the carpet out of a specially lightweight weave.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.530
And the results speak for themselves.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.730
This is by far and away the heaviest car of the three.

08:10.130 --> 08:11.910
Have you noticed something, Hammond?

08:11.910 --> 08:12.880
What?

08:13.530 --> 08:16.860
I don't see a black Lamborghini anywhere near us.

08:16.860 --> 08:20.350
What, you mean the one that is on paper the fastest here?

08:21.970 --> 08:23.870
'James was merrily tootling along,

08:23.870 --> 08:27.760
'apparently under the illusion he was presenting his wine programme.'

08:29.180 --> 08:30.780
Good place to stop for a bag of grapes.

08:30.780 --> 08:33.390
There's three more people holding up grapes, there's a fourth...

08:33.390 --> 08:38.330
a fifth, a sixth. I think we're well covered for grapes, there.

08:38.960 --> 08:43.539
'Meanwhile, Hammond's Ferrari had decided all on its own 'to make a telephone call.'

08:44.380 --> 08:46.970
'Selected. Calling...Vernon Kay.'

08:46.970 --> 08:48.020
What?! Vernon...?

08:48.020 --> 08:48.840
'Is this correct?'

08:48.840 --> 08:50.580
Why are you calling Vernon Kay?

08:51.270 --> 08:52.560
Why are you doing that?

08:53.140 --> 08:53.980
'Hello?'

08:53.980 --> 08:54.830
Vernon?

08:55.520 --> 08:57.170
'Hi?'

08:57.170 --> 08:59.260
Hello, mate,it's Richard Hammond.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.630
'For miles, our convoy ruled the road. But then...'

09:03.630 --> 09:05.250
Oh, my God! Look here!

09:07.610 --> 09:09.780
What's that?! Wha..?

09:09.780 --> 09:11.800
That's the Dacia Sandero.

09:12.660 --> 09:14.660
I'm going to see if I can hold on to the back of it.

09:15.450 --> 09:17.840
The 1.2 16-valve -that thing can shift!

09:18.400 --> 09:22.060
Come on! Keep up with the Sandero!

09:23.190 --> 09:26.260
'Hammond's Ferrari might have got it, but unfortunately...'

09:27.070 --> 09:28.120
Why are you doing that now?

09:28.120 --> 09:30.220
Why are you calling Vernon Kay again?

09:30.910 --> 09:31.840
'Hi, Richard!'

09:31.840 --> 09:35.730
Vernon! Er, it's Richard Hammond. Again.

09:35.730 --> 09:37.450
Er...I'm really sorry.

09:37.450 --> 09:41.940
'No, it's fine. I'm just in the studio, everyone's stopped work...'

09:41.940 --> 09:43.950
Good. Good.

09:48.990 --> 09:51.950
'While refuelling on the outskirts of Bucharest,

09:51.950 --> 09:54.000
'James and Richard bought me a present.'

09:54.000 --> 09:54.950
Great(!)

09:54.950 --> 09:55.550
What now?

09:55.550 --> 09:57.350
My life is complete, that's what.

09:57.350 --> 09:59.590
Very big round here, apparently.

09:59.590 --> 10:01.730
'And then James thought of a new game.'

10:01.730 --> 10:05.010
Why don't we have a sat-nav challenge?

10:05.010 --> 10:08.620
Because mine is a German one and will be superior.

10:08.620 --> 10:10.670
It's Audi, isn't it? It is.

10:10.670 --> 10:12.480
Good idea. We can start here.

10:12.480 --> 10:15.830
Ready steady go, set your sat-nav for the People's Palace.

10:15.830 --> 10:20.430
I know it exists. First to get to the People's Palace is the winner.

10:20.430 --> 10:21.250
Are you ready?

10:21.250 --> 10:22.060
Yes.

10:22.060 --> 10:23.580
Steady? Yes.

10:23.580 --> 10:24.900
Go!

10:24.900 --> 10:27.960
Now, I should explain before we start, I have a Volvo system.

10:28.620 --> 10:33.250
Unanimously, everybody agrees it's the worst sat-nav in the world.

10:33.860 --> 10:36.960
Rise! Rise!

10:37.880 --> 10:39.530
'Mercifully, in the California,

10:39.530 --> 10:42.760
the sat-nav system was much better than the Bluetooth.'

10:43.370 --> 10:46.300
Nearby point of interest, that's the first order of business.

10:47.030 --> 10:48.120
'Whereas in the Lambo,

10:48.120 --> 10:50.460
James was regretting his new game.'

10:50.460 --> 10:53.340
Country.

10:53.340 --> 10:56.380
I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q... 
I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q...

10:56.380 --> 10:57.620
It goes from Portugal to Sam...

10:57.620 --> 10:58.610
How can it not have...?

10:59.710 --> 11:03.750
The Italians don't acknowledge the existence of Romania.

11:04.470 --> 11:05.800
1-1-7
. 1 1 7

11:06.430 --> 11:07.190
1 1 
1-1...

11:07.190 --> 11:10.690
No, no, no. 1 to 42, that is all.

11:10.690 --> 11:11.850
Right, I've got it.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.830
No! No, no!

11:17.840 --> 11:20.700
Er, People's Palace? People?

11:22.450 --> 11:25.010
Not the best present I've ever had,if I'm honest,

11:25.010 --> 11:27.440
but it's tactless to just ignore them.

11:28.130 --> 11:30.060
'Please follow the road.'

11:30.060 --> 11:31.420
Yes.I will gladly follow the road,

11:32.030 --> 11:34.310
for...7.3kms.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.720
Technology and I are now getting on absolutely fine.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.550
'Calling Stephen Accountant.'

11:40.550 --> 11:42.310
No, no, no, don't do that.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.590
Go to the roundabout here. Yep.

11:44.590 --> 11:46.190
And here...

11:47.140 --> 11:49.660
Here in sub... No.

11:49.660 --> 11:54.220
One of the most irritating things about the Volvo system that Aston use,

11:54.220 --> 11:56.570
 is that it tells you where you've been.

11:56.570 --> 12:00.190
Which is only of any use if you think your wife's having an affair.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.490
James was now on the move,

12:02.490 --> 12:05.990
but obviously his map had been drawn by a distant relative.

12:05.990 --> 12:09.110
When he said roundabout, did he mean roundabout?

12:09.110 --> 12:11.070
Or did he mean crossroads?

12:11.830 --> 12:15.370
Fortunately, the producers had given me a Romanian phrasebook.

12:15.980 --> 12:18.500
Unfortunately,it was a bit confusing.

12:32.330 --> 12:35.070
the sat-nav race was hotting up.

12:35.930 --> 12:38.200
Hammond! Get him!

12:38.200 --> 12:39.480
What's he doing here?

12:39.480 --> 12:40.650
Come on!

12:42.960 --> 12:45.220
I'm winning by 1.5 metres.

12:45.220 --> 12:46.800
I found it first.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.610
No, I found it with my eyes.

12:48.610 --> 12:50.570
No, you didn't. I found it first.

13:01.930 --> 13:03.220
This...

13:05.450 --> 13:07.680
But when we saw the People's Palace,

13:07.680 --> 13:09.560
we sort of stopped.

13:12.780 --> 13:15.320
Today it's the Romanian Parliament building.

13:15.320 --> 13:20.750
But it was once the private house of notorious dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.990
If that's his idea of a house,

13:25.710 --> 13:27.660
what's his idea of a road gonna be like?

13:27.660 --> 13:31.310
You know that is the heaviest building in the world?

13:31.310 --> 13:32.860
That's what you'd build, isn't it?

13:32.860 --> 13:35.730
It is. A million cubic metres of marble in there.

13:36.580 --> 13:39.110
Ceausescu was a mental, wasn't he? Complete mental.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.650
And an unpleasant mental.

13:40.650 --> 13:44.150
He had people go ahead of him and paint the leaves green, wherever he went.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.100
As we waited,

13:46.100 --> 13:48.770
James had become really lost.

14:02.810 --> 14:04.060
That's it.

14:05.410 --> 14:09.900
While we waited we were informed we might get a visit from a local dignitary.

14:11.270 --> 14:15.320
The Secretary General of the Chamber of Deputies.

14:15.910 --> 14:18.250
Jeremy, you are familiar with the local customs, aren't you?

14:18.250 --> 14:19.120
What?

14:19.120 --> 14:22.630
Penis out. When she stands to shake hands, you just plop it in.

14:23.180 --> 14:24.400
And that's what you do.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.890
That's how it works.

14:25.890 --> 14:27.580
Hello, sir. Hello.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.100
It was a Lam...Lam...Lamborghini.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.160
Behold the People's Palace.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.460
James, you lost that one. Quite badly.

14:51.420 --> 14:54.660
While waiting for James the local dignitary had given us permission

14:54.660 --> 14:59.260
to drive in the network of tunnels underneath the government building.

15:00.860 --> 15:04.690
This, we feel, is not something that would be allowed in Britain.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.730
Start the music!

15:24.040 --> 15:26.010
Jeez, there's a corner there!

15:35.060 --> 15:36.560
Dust. Dust!

15:37.360 --> 15:38.670
Can't see a thing!

15:40.040 --> 15:45.350
We then decided to bring a bit of science to the party.

15:47.920 --> 15:53.400
That is a decibel-o-meter and I'm going to see how loud the Ferrari is. Ready?

15:54.320 --> 15:55.910
Not too bad, 70...82.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.620
 89? 89

16:10.620 --> 16:13.290
I saw an 89 average. -I saw 89. -89, yeah.

16:13.290 --> 16:14.440
What a lot of dust, jeez.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.460
It's quite dusty down there.

16:15.460 --> 16:17.320
This is our best game yet.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.990
All you need to play this game,

16:18.990 --> 16:20.330
in case you're interested at home,

16:20.330 --> 16:23.240
is a People's Palace, with a tunnel underneath it. Yeah.

16:23.240 --> 16:26.350
Three supercars and a cheap app and you're there! You're there!

16:29.760 --> 16:33.040
It turned out that all three cars were equally loud.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.100
So, we abandoned the science

16:37.950 --> 16:39.340
and went to the pub.

16:40.810 --> 16:44.950
Where we were just in time to catch the local version of Top Gear.

16:46.610 --> 16:49.180
SPEAKS IN ROMANIAN

16:49.220 --> 16:51.530
I just wish that girl would get out the way,

16:51.530 --> 16:53.700
so we could see the car more!

16:55.000 --> 16:56.810
I bet that would sound good in the tunnels.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.110
What a magnificent thing.

17:07.930 --> 17:08.920
We'll pick that, er,

17:08.920 --> 17:10.430
we'll pick that up later on.

17:11.410 --> 17:14.829
But now it is time to do the news.

17:15.420 --> 17:17.619
And we begin with a story from Australia, in fact.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.109
Er, Australian authorities

17:20.109 --> 17:22.980
are really going to get tough on boozed up fans

17:22.980 --> 17:25.230
at the Bathurst Motor Race.

17:25.230 --> 17:27.619
Well, I say motor race, it's actually a fight

17:27.619 --> 17:31.730
between rival gangs of Ford supporters and GM supporters.

17:31.730 --> 17:34.530
OK, now the way they've cracked this, is they say

17:34.530 --> 17:40.400
each fan is going to be limited to just 24 cans of lager each per day.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.010
Just 24?

17:42.010 --> 17:43.620
24 a day, no more than that.

17:43.620 --> 17:47.510
And Australians, don't think you can get round this by switching to wine,

17:47.510 --> 17:49.420
because that's limited as well,

17:49.420 --> 17:51.260
to four litres a day.

17:52.630 --> 17:54.730
Do you know what they're doing,to get round it?

17:54.730 --> 17:56.000
What, Australians? Yeah.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.250
Australians are going there two weeks before the race

17:58.250 --> 18:01.510
and burying beer.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.530
We have an Australian guest on later,

18:03.530 --> 18:05.710
I'm going to talk to him about this. I'm fascinated. Yes.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.070
Now. We must move on. We must.

18:08.070 --> 18:10.520
McLaren have a announced a new supercar, here it is.

18:10.520 --> 18:13.510
It's called the MP4-12C.

18:13.510 --> 18:16.330
Mmmm. That'll sound good with adenoids.

18:16.330 --> 18:20.530
"Wanna come for a ride in my MP4 dash 12C?"

18:20.530 --> 18:22.510
No, I don't, it sounds like a telephone.

18:22.510 --> 18:25.180
However, um, interesting thing about this car particularly

18:25.180 --> 18:28.620
is the previous McLaren supercars, the F1 and the Merc SLR,

18:28.620 --> 18:31.010
were very, very expensive.

18:31.010 --> 18:33.370
This - GBP170,000.

18:33.370 --> 18:35.020
-Oh, cheap.-Oh, that's all right then.

18:35.020 --> 18:36.590
As I said that I realised...

18:36.590 --> 18:38.140
I know what you mean it's cheap-er.

18:38.140 --> 18:39.050
Absolutely.

18:39.050 --> 18:40.780
It's same...Half the price of the SLR.

18:40.780 --> 18:43.190
This is the first time they've put their own engine into it,

18:43.190 --> 18:46.520
3.8 litre 2 turbo V8, so there's a lot of exciting things about it.

18:46.520 --> 18:49.090
I hope that works, McLaren have had a rotten week.

18:49.090 --> 18:51.110
All their vehicles have been recalled,

18:51.110 --> 18:52.790
cos they've been amputating peoples' limbs.

18:52.790 --> 18:54.670
No that's not... no, yeah.

18:54.670 --> 18:55.500
What?

18:55.500 --> 18:57.590
It's not the vehicles, mate,

18:57.590 --> 18:59.640
it's the prams, the pushchairs,

18:59.640 --> 19:00.800
Maclaren buggies.

19:00.800 --> 19:04.830
Oh! I thought Rowan Atkinson had had his arm cut off by his car. -No.

19:04.830 --> 19:06.280
It's Maclaren prams?

19:06.280 --> 19:07.520
Yes, the buggies, the pushchairs.

19:07.520 --> 19:08.280
Oh, God!

19:08.280 --> 19:09.940
Interesting thing about this story

19:09.940 --> 19:13.420
is it's come about because of 12 cases in the States

19:13.420 --> 19:15.890
of children having their fingers amputated.

19:15.890 --> 19:18.770
So, as a result they've recalled all the pushchairs.

19:18.770 --> 19:20.570
But the pushchairs are the same all over the world

19:20.570 --> 19:23.820
and it's only in the States they're recalling them. Not here.

19:23.820 --> 19:26.900
No, there's a very good reason for that though.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.460
British parents are more...

19:30.310 --> 19:32.040
What's the word I'm looking for?

19:32.040 --> 19:33.880
Intelligent. Yes!

19:35.510 --> 19:36.630
Cos how could you? Hey!

19:36.920 --> 19:38.140
US ACCENT: I can't shut this buggy down,

19:38.140 --> 19:40.440
there's these pink things in the way.

19:40.440 --> 19:45.350
I've got the kid screaming his head off! Shut-up, Junior.

19:46.110 --> 19:47.200
That's got it!

19:47.200 --> 19:48.320
Stop yelling.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.450
It's...there you go.

19:49.450 --> 19:52.680
Now, do you want to combine your love of camping,

19:52.680 --> 19:55.330
 with your love of buying the wrong Porsche?

19:56.760 --> 19:58.610
No, because I have good news, OK?

19:58.610 --> 20:01.510
Because you can now buy, um, well,

20:01.510 --> 20:03.410
it's a new type of Boxster, OK?

20:03.410 --> 20:05.160
With a tent on the top of it.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.220
Here it is.

20:06.840 --> 20:07.790
Look at that roof!

20:08.610 --> 20:10.330
It looks like a tramp's hat.

20:10.330 --> 20:13.530
It's called the Boxster Spyder

20:13.530 --> 20:15.410
and it's a super lightweight version.

20:15.410 --> 20:18.010
It only weighs 1,250 kilos, top speed

20:18.010 --> 20:21.030
166mph, 0-60 in 4.8 seconds.

20:21.030 --> 20:23.630
And it's that fast because it's got a very clever gearbox.

20:23.630 --> 20:25.620
It's called a... it's...

20:25.620 --> 20:26.590
Well, it's...

20:26.590 --> 20:27.290
Is it German?

20:27.290 --> 20:29.210
It's a German name. And it's complicated.

20:29.210 --> 20:30.570
Let me just spell this out -

20:30.570 --> 20:34.000
it's a D-O-P-P-E-L

20:34.000 --> 20:37.060
K-U-P-P-L

20:37.060 --> 20:39.250
U-N-G

20:39.970 --> 20:44.450
S-G-E-T...

20:45.230 --> 20:47.520
R...

20:47.520 --> 20:49.200
I-E...

20:49.200 --> 20:51.370
B...

20:51.370 --> 20:53.290
E.

20:53.290 --> 20:54.530
That's what it is...I...

20:54.530 --> 20:56.500
Can we? Get it on the screen.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.870
Are there any Germans here?

20:59.490 --> 21:00.440
That's a long word!

21:00.440 --> 21:01.130
That is a...

21:01.130 --> 21:01.870
Do you know what that means?You speak German.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.140
I do.

21:03.140 --> 21:05.160
What's the only German you can say?

21:05.160 --> 21:08.140
Naturlich ist Hans nass, er steht unter dem Wasserfall

21:08.140 --> 21:08.890
What's that mean?

21:08.890 --> 21:11.350
Naturally Hans is wet he's standing under a waterfall.

21:13.660 --> 21:14.520
OK.

21:14.520 --> 21:15.700
I use it all the time.

21:15.700 --> 21:18.820
That's kind of a one shot deal,isn't it?

21:18.820 --> 21:21.630
Er, anyway, if you want the wrong car,

21:21.630 --> 21:23.400
which has no door handles,

21:23.400 --> 21:25.750
and no air conditioning and no radio

21:25.750 --> 21:27.620
and has a tent on the top of it,

21:27.620 --> 21:28.780
then there you are,

21:28.780 --> 21:30.660
the Boxster double line. Spyder.

21:30.660 --> 21:32.010
It's not got all those things to keep it light

21:32.010 --> 21:33.500
 cos it's still GBP44,000.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.060
GBP44,000, you don't even get door handles.

21:37.470 --> 21:38.680
We've been sent this.

21:38.680 --> 21:41.490
It's an eco-friendly, portable,

21:41.490 --> 21:44.600
disposable, cardboard lavatory,

21:44.600 --> 21:46.850
for use by the side of the road.

21:46.850 --> 21:48.690
The idea is you're driving along, you get caught a bit short,

21:48.690 --> 21:50.560
can't find the nearest karzy,

21:50.560 --> 21:53.340
you pop this out, erect it and do what you have to do.

21:53.340 --> 21:55.400
Are you about to tell us you have been caught short? No.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.760
Cos I don't think you should.

21:56.760 --> 21:57.710
No, I was going to say,

21:57.710 --> 22:00.430
we shall give this a fair test on Top Gear

22:00.430 --> 22:03.700
by giving it to the world's most practical man, Clarkson.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.110
What you want me to build it?

22:07.110 --> 22:08.110
I do.

22:08.110 --> 22:10.620
Oh, God, I hate this sort of thing.

22:11.300 --> 22:12.620
Where's the instructions?

22:12.620 --> 22:13.970
Have you ever noticed,

22:13.970 --> 22:15.430
watching him do anything practical,

22:15.430 --> 22:17.420
it's like watching an orangutan?

22:18.470 --> 22:19.920
It is! Look at his face.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.280
-Honestly, look at his face,-it goes all...It's very long.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.300
He's happy, but confused.

22:25.220 --> 22:27.070
They actually put a picture of Jeremy on the bag, look,

22:27.070 --> 22:28.630
showing you how to assemble it.

22:29.470 --> 22:31.630
These instructions, look!

22:31.630 --> 22:34.420
They bear no relation, as always,

22:34.420 --> 22:36.600
to the thing they're supplied with.

22:36.600 --> 22:37.930
See, he's doing the ape thing.

22:37.930 --> 22:38.790
And bear in mind,

22:38.790 --> 22:39.890
you have to erect this...

22:40.720 --> 22:42.650
while basically desperate for a number two, with...

22:42.650 --> 22:43.730
I was going to say...

22:43.730 --> 22:45.040
With lorries going by.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.990
Could you erect this while you were touching cloth? You can?

22:50.080 --> 22:51.700
See if you can get that erected.

22:51.700 --> 22:55.430
I'm prepared to bet that question has never been asked on any other car show.

22:57.550 --> 22:58.330
She's good.

22:58.330 --> 22:59.460
How've you done that?

23:00.070 --> 23:01.630
She's bloody done it, look.

23:01.630 --> 23:02.710
That was it.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.000
How did you do that?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.580
Look she's made a lavatory.

23:10.900 --> 23:11.790
You did what?

23:11.790 --> 23:13.260
I'm female.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.690
You're a...she's a female.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.590
So, you just put that up at the side of the road and then...

23:21.590 --> 23:23.160
There's no need to demonstrate!

23:29.810 --> 23:31.780
How did you think that was going to go?

23:31.780 --> 23:34.320
How did you think that was going to work?

23:35.000 --> 23:36.970
You great dumb ape.

23:36.970 --> 23:38.900
Do you know what, honestly?

23:38.900 --> 23:40.630
I'd rather just crap myself.

23:41.560 --> 23:42.980
I think I just did!

23:45.540 --> 23:46.610
Can we move on?

23:46.610 --> 23:49.470
I'm not the world's most unpractical man. -You are.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.400
I am, actually. You're right.

23:51.400 --> 23:52.220
Anyway, we've got to get on.

23:52.220 --> 23:54.690
Yes, anyway, we've had a letter.

23:54.690 --> 23:56.650
It's literally from some bankers

23:56.650 --> 23:57.870
and it says,

23:57.870 --> 24:00.410
"Dear Top Gear, this time last year

24:00.410 --> 24:02.000
we didn't have any money,

24:02.000 --> 24:03.830
"but the Government has given us some now.

24:03.830 --> 24:07.010
"However, we don't want the public to know that we're loaded again,

24:07.080 --> 24:10.850
"so we need really fast, expensive cars that are quite discreet.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.860
"Can you help?  Yours sincerely, some bankers."

24:13.860 --> 24:17.810
Well, as it happens, yes, we can help.

24:22.180 --> 24:24.580
And we begin with something from BMW.

24:30.650 --> 24:34.210
This here is the BMW 760Li.

24:34.210 --> 24:35.160
Or to give it it's other name -

24:35.160 --> 24:37.850
the BMW Move Over Poor Person.

24:37.850 --> 24:40.230
Because this is the biggest,most expensive

24:40.230 --> 24:44.130
and most powerful car BMW makes.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.340
It has a six litre V12,

24:49.340 --> 24:50.740
which sounds like plenty.

24:51.590 --> 24:54.140
But, obviously,someone at BMW thought, "No".

24:54.760 --> 24:56.970
So, for a bit of extra "schnell,"

24:56.970 --> 24:59.420
this car has got two turbo chargers.

25:01.360 --> 25:04.590
The result is 544 BHP.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.810
And the power station under the bonnet is connected to

25:06.810 --> 25:10.380
a brand new eight speed gearbox.

25:11.660 --> 25:14.910
Put all that together and even someone as laid back as me

25:14.910 --> 25:21.120
can quite easily, look, get a bit of a lick on.

25:22.650 --> 25:25.660
It'll batter most 911's in a sprint to 60,

25:26.820 --> 25:30.730
and de-limited, it would hit 188 miles per hour.

25:31.600 --> 25:35.420
But those numbers only tell half the story.

25:37.520 --> 25:40.020
This is a bizarre kind of fast.

25:40.020 --> 25:43.080
It's quiet and relaxed and smooth.

25:43.080 --> 25:46.520
It's like swimming over a waterfall of double cream.

25:51.470 --> 25:53.280
A luxurious waterfall, too.

25:54.150 --> 25:56.610
The 760 has seats that massage you,

25:56.610 --> 25:59.940
and an SAS spec night vision system.

26:02.840 --> 26:03.940
And here's a clever thing.

26:03.940 --> 26:05.400
Pulling up to this junction,

26:05.400 --> 26:06.810
the view is quite obstructed,

26:06.810 --> 26:08.230
I can't really see what's coming.

26:08.230 --> 26:10.010
But if I press this button,

26:10.010 --> 26:11.970
there are little cameras mounted on the wings

26:11.970 --> 26:15.590
that give you eyes on the side of your head. It's like being a rabbit.

26:17.210 --> 26:18.150
And the price?

26:18.150 --> 26:21.140
A smudge under GBP100,000.

26:21.790 --> 26:23.900
If you have that sort of money to spend on a car,

26:23.900 --> 26:27.460
there's a good chance you'll want to pay someone to drive it for you.

26:27.460 --> 26:30.640
So that's exactly what I've done,I've got myself a chauffeur.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.970
He's in a bit of a bad mood to be honest,

26:33.970 --> 26:35.830
because I've told him this is my test.

26:35.830 --> 26:38.550
It's not about tyre smoke and going sideways.

26:38.550 --> 26:41.090
Dignified driving is what I want.

26:42.180 --> 26:44.340
This version of the seven series is only available

26:44.340 --> 26:46.130
as a long wheel base model,

26:46.130 --> 26:49.010
which means you get an extra five inches of leg room in the back.

26:49.010 --> 26:51.050
Doesn't sound like much, but it makes a world of difference.

26:51.050 --> 26:53.130
And I can watch the TV.

26:53.130 --> 26:56.540
I've got something on here, it's interesting, it's about antiques...

26:56.540 --> 27:00.750
What are you doing, man?

27:05.410 --> 27:06.400
Bloody hell!

27:07.220 --> 27:08.590
Oh, God, I see the problem.

27:08.590 --> 27:11.130
The Mercedes S63 has turned up,

27:11.130 --> 27:13.090
that's the other car I was going to test,

27:14.150 --> 27:16.410
and that sort of puts Stigs on heat.

27:20.500 --> 27:23.860
That S-class is actually the AMG tuned version.

27:23.860 --> 27:25.390
Apparently it's a bit of a rocket ship,

27:25.390 --> 27:27.480
I can see why Stig's got the red mist.

27:29.210 --> 27:31.400
Luckily, Stig's a bit too stupid

27:31.400 --> 27:33.510
to work out where all the driver aids are on this.

27:35.870 --> 27:37.190
Oh no, he's found it.

27:37.190 --> 27:41.190
Stig has put the dynamic driving control into sport plus,

27:41.190 --> 27:44.270
that sharpens up throttle response and gear changes!

27:46.880 --> 27:47.680
Bloody Nora.

27:52.450 --> 27:54.590
God, he's switched the stability control off altogether...

27:59.810 --> 28:03.660
That locks up the rear differential for extra....ow! Hooligan!

28:13.020 --> 28:17.840
So, the Mercedes. The most powerful non-turbo V8 car in the world.

28:18.930 --> 28:20.580
It costs the same as the BMW,

28:20.580 --> 28:24.610
it comes only in business class,long wheel base form, like the BMW,

28:24.610 --> 28:28.130
and like the BMW, it's dripping with technology.

28:30.110 --> 28:34.190
Even the interior lighting has three different colour settings.

28:35.520 --> 28:39.080
In fact, there's such a bewildering array of gizmos on both cars,

28:39.080 --> 28:43.840
that it's almost impossible to choose between them.

28:49.180 --> 28:51.770
We're going to make it easier with a game of Top Trumps.

28:51.770 --> 28:53.450
Here's my opponent, the Stig.

28:53.450 --> 28:54.760
It's like normal Top Trumps,

28:54.760 --> 28:57.290
except all of Stiggy's cards are the BMW,

28:57.290 --> 29:00.090
and all of mine are the Mercedes. Ready?

29:02.040 --> 29:05.470
OK, TV screens.Mercedes has TV in the front.

29:08.150 --> 29:09.830
BMW...I know the answer to this,

29:09.830 --> 29:11.270
it's got two, isn't it?

29:11.270 --> 29:14.910
Front and rear, so you win that pair.

29:16.910 --> 29:18.010
Climate control.

29:18.010 --> 29:20.200
Mercedes - two zone.

29:20.990 --> 29:22.490
And the BMW, we know,

29:22.490 --> 29:24.330
has four zone climate control,

29:24.330 --> 29:25.950
so you win that pair.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.000
It's not difficult.

29:28.830 --> 29:32.620
Seat massage system. Mercedes -front and rear seat massage.

29:34.280 --> 29:40.860
And the BMW, massage seat only in the front, so I win that pair.

29:40.860 --> 29:42.700
Right, BHP...

29:47.950 --> 29:49.970
OK, that's not working,

29:49.970 --> 29:53.480
so let's go back to the traditional,philistine Top Gear method.

29:54.230 --> 29:55.360
A drag race.

29:56.470 --> 29:59.140
I went in the Mercedes with Stig at the wheel.

30:00.110 --> 30:02.140
I think I'll have "Firm massage" for this.

30:07.890 --> 30:10.300
The BMW quickly took the lead.

30:11.910 --> 30:13.710
And stayed there till the end.

30:15.380 --> 30:18.140
That made Stig so angry he went home.

30:20.270 --> 30:22.350
So, the S-class. When you drive it,

30:22.350 --> 30:26.360
you realise it's got much more of a split personality than the BMW.

30:28.070 --> 30:31.170
On the one hand, it has lots of very civilising features,

30:31.170 --> 30:33.650
it has active body control,

30:33.650 --> 30:37.860
and it's so clever it can detect a cross-wind and compensate for it.

30:37.860 --> 30:42.050
It even has a drowsiness sensor to prevent you from nodding off.

30:44.040 --> 30:50.560
But put your foot down and suddenly it erupts with typical AMG volcanic storm and fury.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.990
And here's something that really baffles me.

30:57.760 --> 31:00.820
On the dashboard I have a race timer

31:00.820 --> 31:03.350
that allows you to record your lap times. But why?

31:04.330 --> 31:06.460
I mean, in a 911 GT3, yes.

31:06.460 --> 31:08.310
But who's that for?

31:08.920 --> 31:10.630
Sir Alan Sugar on a track day?

31:12.290 --> 31:14.030
And that's the problem with the Mercedes,

31:14.030 --> 31:16.850
it has a strangely confused personality.

31:17.020 --> 31:18.560
And for that reason,

31:18.560 --> 31:21.110
Mercedes S63 AMG...

31:22.650 --> 31:24.020
..you're fired.

31:31.060 --> 31:32.440
So, let's just get this straight.

31:33.150 --> 31:35.840
Quite wrongly, you prefer the BMW.

31:36.390 --> 31:38.380
No, I think they're both completely pointless.

31:38.380 --> 31:39.890
Couldn't agree with you more.

31:39.890 --> 31:41.330
They are absolutely pointless.

31:41.330 --> 31:43.370
And now, I'm afraid,

31:43.370 --> 31:47.380
we must dive even more deeply into the murky waters of their irrelevance

31:47.380 --> 31:50.270
by handing them over to our tame racing driver.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.500
Some say, that in the autumn,

31:53.500 --> 31:56.960
all his arms go brown and fall off.

31:53.960 --> 31:58.530
{\a6\fn??????\c&HFFDC35&\fs16}

31:58.530 --> 32:00.770
And that if he wrote you a letter of condolence,

31:58.770 --> 32:02.770
{\a6\fn??????\c&HFFDC35&\fs16} 

32:00.770 --> 32:02.530
he would at least get your name right.

32:04.490 --> 32:07.460
All we know is, he's called the Stog

32:07.460 --> 32:08.460
You mean the Stig.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.240
That's what I said. I said it!

32:12.790 --> 32:13.620
And they're off!

32:13.620 --> 32:15.390
It is very wet out there,

32:15.390 --> 32:18.350
tiny wiggle of the hips from the BMW as the turbos spool up.

32:18.970 --> 32:20.370
Here's something not very interesting,

32:20.370 --> 32:24.370
that 760 has BMW's first petrol V12 with two turbos.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.380
That is much more interesting there,

32:27.380 --> 32:29.200
he's going very sideways!

32:30.090 --> 32:34.490
{\c&H26F4FF&}{\fs14}MUSIC: "Rabbit" By Chas and Dave

32:34.020 --> 32:36.740
I should say the Stig is deeply saddened

32:34.540 --> 32:41.740
{\a6\fn??????\c&HFFDC35&\fs16} 

32:36.740 --> 32:38.560
that Chas and Dave have split up.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.750
This is his way of getting through the pain.

32:41.400 --> 32:43.400
That BMW is very sideways there,

32:43.400 --> 32:46.450
coming up to the hammerhead we're expecting understeer here

32:46.450 --> 32:49.110
from these two-tonne barges.

32:49.910 --> 32:53.610
And, yep, the seven series is ploughing wide, but more composed.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.940
I suspect because the traction control can't be fully switched off.

32:58.380 --> 32:59.760
Here we are, follow-through.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.410
It really is wet out there.

33:02.520 --> 33:05.490
Stig would be better off in an actual barge, I think.

33:05.490 --> 33:06.810
Quick through the tyres,

33:06.810 --> 33:09.520
look up "brave" in the dictionary it says "See The Stig".

33:09.520 --> 33:10.950
Two corners left.

33:10.950 --> 33:13.030
BMW's all over the shop.

33:13.030 --> 33:14.830
That let the S-class ahead,

33:14.830 --> 33:16.740
but they're evenly matched coming through Gambon!

33:16.740 --> 33:18.550
Across the line!

33:20.640 --> 33:21.520
Does it go here?

33:22.190 --> 33:23.110
No, it doesn't.

33:23.960 --> 33:24.860
Does it go here?

33:24.860 --> 33:25.950
No, it doesn't.

33:27.290 --> 33:27.990
Go on then.

33:27.990 --> 33:31.850
Right, the Mercedes S63 did it there in 1.32.1.

33:31.850 --> 33:36.060
The BMW did it in... 1.31.2

33:36.860 --> 33:39.110
There we are. If you are a banker

33:39.110 --> 33:41.300
and you like to get anywhere in a big hurry,

33:41.300 --> 33:42.570
go for the BMW.

33:43.700 --> 33:44.860
Consumer advice for you there.

33:45.530 --> 33:48.280
Now, it is time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.

33:49.120 --> 33:52.910
My guest tonight, it seems,always wanted to be a racing driver,

33:52.910 --> 33:56.420
but then he accidentally ended up being in films like

33:56.720 --> 33:59.100
Star Trek, Finding Nemo,

33:59.100 --> 34:02.100
Blackhawk Down, Troy,

34:02.100 --> 34:03.880
and so on and so forth.

34:03.880 --> 34:06.530
So, here to find out what on earth went wrong,

34:06.530 --> 34:08.650
from somewhere called Australia,

34:08.650 --> 34:10.350
ladies and gentlemen, Eric Bana!

34:14.620 --> 34:15.760
Good to see you, how are you?

34:15.760 --> 34:16.929
Very well, very well.

34:16.929 --> 34:17.920
Have a seat.

34:19.830 --> 34:21.550
A proper superstar is here!

34:22.949 --> 34:23.790
What's in there?

34:24.639 --> 34:25.520
There?

34:26.409 --> 34:29.040
It's water, it's OK, it won't have anything dangerous in it. -Yeah.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.070
This Bathurst Motor Race we were talking about,

34:32.070 --> 34:33.830
have you heard about the beer thing?

34:33.830 --> 34:39.190
They're limiting the amount of beer each fan can take to 24 cans a day.

34:39.190 --> 34:41.090
That's a serious restriction.

34:42.719 --> 34:45.100
That's practically tee-totalling, isn't it?

34:45.860 --> 34:49.400
This rivalry between Ford and GM,

34:49.400 --> 34:52.270
it's ingrained from birth,isn't it, in all Australians?

34:52.270 --> 34:54.840
It's pretty deep seated.

34:54.840 --> 34:57.920
They were the two main manufacturers, if you're my age,

34:57.920 --> 35:00.280
when you were growing up. It was, you know,

35:00.280 --> 35:02.140
the General Motors product which was Holden,

35:02.140 --> 35:05.660
Commodores and Toranas and for me it was Falcons.

35:05.660 --> 35:07.920
I said to the two guys,

35:07.920 --> 35:09.900
the two Aussies who are here in the audience somewhere,

35:09.900 --> 35:12.550
I said "Eric Bana's coming on,"they went "Ah, Ford bloke."

35:13.580 --> 35:14.420
That was it. You're a Ford bloke

35:14.420 --> 35:16.120
so you're no good. You're a Ford bloke,

35:16.120 --> 35:17.360
they're Holden blokes.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.530
Completely discounted me, huh?

35:18.530 --> 35:20.450
Yeah, exactly.

35:20.450 --> 35:23.360
It seems to me that Bathurst combines everything, really,

35:23.360 --> 35:25.030
that you need in Australia.

35:25.030 --> 35:26.310
Outside cooking, obviously.

35:26.310 --> 35:28.400
Drinking and sport.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.620
This sport thing, it's weird,

35:30.620 --> 35:32.630
cos you're no good at it.

35:32.630 --> 35:33.520
Oh, really?

35:33.520 --> 35:37.030
Really? Cite a couple of examples.

35:37.030 --> 35:38.640
The Ashes.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.160
The most recent one,

35:40.160 --> 35:40.940
the most recent one.

35:40.940 --> 35:42.050
Rugby, the other day?

35:42.050 --> 35:43.130
Didn't we beat you last week?

35:43.130 --> 35:44.840
We weren't playing! It was Jonny

35:44.840 --> 35:46.810
Wilkinson and some lawyers.

35:49.120 --> 35:51.190
Do you know the best thing about having an Aussie here,

35:51.190 --> 35:53.770
and I don't know if it's the same in Australia,

35:53.770 --> 35:57.760
there are very few countrymen or countrywomen that we can tease.

35:57.760 --> 36:01.750
Australia and England, it seems to me, are the last two countries

36:01.750 --> 36:03.460
where if you can go there and go,

36:03.460 --> 36:05.400
"Hide your wallet under the soap, he won't find it there."

36:06.350 --> 36:08.280
If you said to the Americans you lost in Vietnam!

36:11.790 --> 36:13.040
They just don't find that funny.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.910
I mean, to be honest, we're happy, we ended up in the best country.

36:15.910 --> 36:20.240
It's not a bad second prize as far as you're concerned. -It's dangerous.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.700
 It's quite dangerous, Australia. -Why?

36:22.720 --> 36:23.920
How old are you?

36:23.920 --> 36:24.930
41.

36:24.930 --> 36:27.570
You must be the oldest Australian that hasn't been eaten by a shark

36:27.570 --> 36:29.430
or bitten by a spider that killed him.

36:29.430 --> 36:35.710
That's what happens when you have great beaches. Ha ha!

36:36.890 --> 36:38.520
We've got great beaches. -Oh, you do!

36:39.500 --> 36:40.830
I know. Awesome surf, too.

36:40.830 --> 36:43.040
At least we have nice names.

36:43.040 --> 36:44.380
Give me an example.

36:44.380 --> 36:46.180
The thing I love about Australia

36:46.180 --> 36:48.220
is the literal names.

36:48.220 --> 36:50.380
"We've got this big, sandy desert in the middle, what shall we call it?

36:50.380 --> 36:51.530
"The Great Sandy Desert."

36:52.370 --> 36:54.420
"We've got this reef off the coast, it's like a barrier.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.690
"The Great Barrier Reef."

36:56.690 --> 36:58.480
This is, of course, as opposed to...

36:59.200 --> 37:00.900
The White Cliffs of Dover,

37:00.900 --> 37:01.750
Yeah.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.810
-Green Park. -That's true, Green Park isn't very good.

37:04.810 --> 37:06.370
Four Weddings And A Funeral.

37:06.370 --> 37:07.410
That wasn't a very good...

37:07.410 --> 37:08.610
What about Mad Max?

37:08.610 --> 37:11.110
"It's about a bloke who's mad and he's called Max."

37:11.110 --> 37:12.100
Perfect title.

37:12.840 --> 37:14.670
I want to get on to the car thing,

37:14.670 --> 37:18.180
cos let's be honest, this proper love that you have,

37:18.180 --> 37:22.460
you are now a bona fide Australian racing driver.

37:22.460 --> 37:26.230
I just have a bit of fun in the Australian GT series,

37:26.230 --> 37:31.150
which is like your version of, it'd be FIA, GT3 racing,

37:31.150 --> 37:33.410
so I'm in a Porsche cup car, 911.

37:33.410 --> 37:36.530
But you're pretty good, it's not like you're some actor who's...

37:36.530 --> 37:38.290
I don't know. I enjoy it

37:38.290 --> 37:39.780
and I'd never stop doing it,

37:39.780 --> 37:41.980
I'm just, you know, I'm obsessed.

37:41.980 --> 37:45.350
Do you say "I'm not gonna do that film because I wanna do that race?"

37:46.590 --> 37:47.980
Is this on in America?

37:47.980 --> 37:50.770
America is the only country in the world this isn't shown.

37:50.770 --> 37:52.480
Of course I've done that! Are you kidding me!

37:56.090 --> 37:56.810
Good man!

37:57.380 --> 37:59.290
Everywhere else in the world will hear that, but not America.

38:00.290 --> 38:01.330
They'll never find out.

38:01.330 --> 38:04.900
If I could just say, you've been in some massive films,

38:05.630 --> 38:08.460
but the one that seems to me to be closest to your heart is the one

38:08.460 --> 38:10.340
you've just brought out now,

38:10.340 --> 38:11.840
which is Love The Beast.

38:11.840 --> 38:12.640
Love The Beast.

38:12.640 --> 38:13.550
Tell me about that,

38:13.550 --> 38:17.140
because it's a very small film compared to, let's say, Troy.

38:17.140 --> 38:19.520
It's a documentary I directed.

38:19.520 --> 38:22.520
I, one day, was looking at my beast,

38:22.520 --> 38:24.650
which is my Ford Falcon coupe.

38:24.650 --> 38:26.510
I've had this car since I was 15.

38:26.510 --> 38:28.390
And I thought this actually isn't a car,

38:28.390 --> 38:33.260
it's some kind of a personal possession

38:33.260 --> 38:37.170
that gets carted around through all kinds of different circumstances.

38:37.170 --> 38:41.650
I started thinking more and more about that, and how cars,

38:41.650 --> 38:43.900
objects in particular, cars,

38:43.900 --> 38:46.610
I feel can transcend themselves to become something else.

38:46.610 --> 38:48.690
I feel very deeply about it.

38:48.690 --> 38:50.380
I couldn't agree more. -Right.

38:50.380 --> 38:53.420
I really do believe that cars take on a personality.

38:53.420 --> 38:54.760
Not all cars, but some do.

38:54.760 --> 38:58.930
So this film is about your relationship with this car?

38:58.930 --> 39:03.560
Yeah, and then I was competing in Targa Tasmania that year,

39:03.560 --> 39:06.010
so I thought well, we'll just make the rally

39:06.010 --> 39:08.620
a bit of an action backdrop to this story

39:08.620 --> 39:11.670
about a guy having a car for his whole life.

39:11.670 --> 39:13.280
Having a relationship with a car. -Yeah.

39:13.280 --> 39:14.520
OK, we have a clip here

39:14.520 --> 39:15.590
which I'd like to show everyone.

39:15.590 --> 39:18.340
3..2..1..go!

39:24.400 --> 39:25.770
Then a five left.

39:28.260 --> 39:29.310
It's slippery apparently.

39:29.310 --> 39:30.490
I feel like I'm breaking in a horse.

39:30.490 --> 39:33.250
I feel like both horses are learning, me and the car.

39:33.250 --> 39:35.350
Take the left, we need to stay on.

39:35.350 --> 39:39.090
Six left, one-two right, 100.

39:39.700 --> 39:40.520
Cut up here.

39:45.430 --> 39:46.940
Jeez!

39:47.350 --> 39:48.360
That hurt?

39:51.170 --> 39:54.200
I think what hurt the most was

39:54.200 --> 39:55.680
just knowing it was gonna happen,

39:55.680 --> 39:57.070
you know, before it happened.

39:57.070 --> 39:59.260
I could have told you that,

39:59.260 --> 40:00.730
if you've got a muscle car, you go round a corner,

40:00.730 --> 40:03.880
you're gonna hit a tree.

40:03.880 --> 40:07.200
Now you end wondering whether to rebuild that car again.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.470
True.

40:08.470 --> 40:10.450
One of the things I was facing...

40:10.450 --> 40:12.130
Whilst I was shooting the documentary,

40:12.130 --> 40:14.690
I never planned on crashing the bloody car.honestly

40:14.690 --> 40:16.950
You know, I'd killed it basically,

40:16.950 --> 40:18.590
and then for a couple of months we thought it was...

40:18.650 --> 40:22.240
It was dead and that we couldn't in fact repair it.

40:22.590 --> 40:25.310
And I decided that if it required a reshell,

40:25.310 --> 40:27.530
that I would not rebuild the car.

40:27.530 --> 40:29.780
But does it? -It doesn't.

40:29.780 --> 40:31.440
So you're gonna rebuild it again?

40:31.440 --> 40:32.570
We're gonna rebuild it again.

40:32.570 --> 40:35.280
You realise everything you earned from Star Trek

40:35.280 --> 40:38.070
is going to be lost the next time you try to go round a

40:38.070 --> 40:40.010
corner when you've rebuilt it. -Yeah.

40:40.010 --> 40:44.220
Now, obviously, you didn't come thousands of miles

40:44.220 --> 40:45.880
to just sit and talk about this.

40:46.540 --> 40:50.480
You came to have a go out there in the reasonably priced car.

40:50.480 --> 40:51.650
So, how was it?

40:51.650 --> 40:53.370
It was slippery,

40:53.370 --> 40:54.780
but it was a lot of fun.

40:54.780 --> 40:58.990
It's been a while since I've driven such a reasonably priced car.

41:00.370 --> 41:02.580
Who would like to see Eric's lap?

41:02.580 --> 41:04.040
Yes!

41:04.040 --> 41:05.320
Let's have a look!

41:07.440 --> 41:08.550
That is slippery.

41:08.550 --> 41:10.270
I'll never play Test cricket,

41:10.980 --> 41:13.610
but I'll drive the Top Gear track!

41:15.050 --> 41:16.110
First corner, now...

41:16.110 --> 41:20.390
Oooh, you see, there's somebody who knows how to drive, look at that!

41:22.290 --> 41:25.090
Feel the grip from the reasonably priced Lacetti now.

41:26.060 --> 41:27.120
Get over!

41:29.010 --> 41:30.880
Were you really putting your heart and soul into this?

41:30.880 --> 41:33.580
Yes, you were!  -I'm not even

41:33.580 --> 41:36.250
going to pretend I don't care what my lap time is.

41:36.250 --> 41:37.790
Get out of the way, birds!

41:38.600 --> 41:40.580
Look, non-dangerous birds.

41:40.580 --> 41:42.500
Not like those ones that burst on your windscreen,

41:42.500 --> 41:45.660
showering you in worms which is what happens in Australia.

41:45.660 --> 41:48.060
Ooh, bit of understeer there.

41:48.060 --> 41:49.660
Lots of understeer there.

41:51.490 --> 41:52.570
Time to put it away.

41:52.570 --> 41:53.590
Ah, these  slots!

41:53.590 --> 41:54.890
Gearbox, sorry about that.

41:54.890 --> 41:55.830
Hasn't mended.

41:56.540 --> 41:58.530
Follow throyuth, I may need to ask you, flat through there?

41:58.530 --> 41:59.990
Flat.

41:59.990 --> 42:01.540
And flat through the tyres,

42:01.540 --> 42:02.470
I'm guessing.

42:03.160 --> 42:05.120
Yep, that looks pretty flat to me.

42:05.120 --> 42:06.390
Second to last corner,

42:06.390 --> 42:07.560
this is the tricky one.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.250
I don't think I ever got this one right.

42:09.250 --> 42:12.410
Let's have a look. You've got to cut it a bit, yes. Perfect.

42:12.410 --> 42:13.930
Now, just Gambon.

42:14.710 --> 42:17.120
Ooh, that's quite legal, most people cheat.

42:17.120 --> 42:20.260
There we are, across the line!

42:24.660 --> 42:29.850
Aha! Now, bearing in mind that that was a wet lap...

42:29.850 --> 42:34.160
It was very slippery. I was waiting for it to dry out, but...

42:34.160 --> 42:35.670
All right! Enough excuses!

42:35.670 --> 42:38.330
It's a wet lap. You were being a racing driver there.

42:38.330 --> 42:40.720
I was looking for the fastest ever wet lap,

42:40.720 --> 42:44.800
which I think was Jamie Oliver on 147.7.

42:45.510 --> 42:47.790
I'm in two minds, I'd like to beat him.

42:47.790 --> 42:49.600
But my wife loves him.

42:51.280 --> 42:55.170
Eric Bana, you did it in 1...

43:09.330 --> 43:14.010
That is the fastest wet lap.....We've ever had.

43:14.920 --> 43:16.510
The fastest.

43:18.070 --> 43:23.230
You are 0.2 of a second faster than a chef.

43:24.590 --> 43:26.380
But you are the fastest Australian.

43:26.380 --> 43:29.450
Is there a wet track Ashes I can take back to Australia?

43:30.880 --> 43:32.820
Tell you what, we'll burn the car and put it in a little thing,

43:32.820 --> 43:34.760
Tell you what, we'll burn the car and put it in a little thing,

43:34.760 --> 43:38.000
you can take it back and Australia can have some ashes. -All right.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.460
Ladies and gentlemen, Eric Bana!

43:48.060 --> 43:52.050
Now, tonight we're in Romania,

43:52.050 --> 43:54.570
looking for the best road in the world.

43:54.570 --> 43:57.230
We're driving an Aston Martin,a Ferrari and a Lamborghini

43:57.230 --> 44:00.340
and so far we'd each decided that our car was the best.

44:00.340 --> 44:05.240
James had got lost, and we'd ended up by mistake in Bucharest.

44:16.620 --> 44:19.680
We left Bucharest the next morning and headed west,

44:19.680 --> 44:24.190
still full of wonderment for this amazing country and our cars.

44:26.880 --> 44:30.590
This car is actually filling me with a sort of primordial lust.

44:30.590 --> 44:34.330
It actually tingles down in my bowels. It's sinful.

44:36.360 --> 44:40.250
I cannot tell you how joyful it is to drive

44:40.250 --> 44:44.150
 a V12 sports car with a proper manual gearbox.

44:46.620 --> 44:50.120
Manual gearbox, really in a GT car?

44:50.120 --> 44:52.540
You want that? It's about making your life easier.

44:52.540 --> 44:54.530
Fast, but easier and more comfortable.

44:54.530 --> 44:56.960
If you're gonna go GTing,

44:58.030 --> 45:00.410
Ferrari, surely

45:04.630 --> 45:06.570
Then disaster.

45:06.570 --> 45:09.920
Romania only has 143 miles of motorway

45:09.920 --> 45:13.900
and by 11am we'd used every one of them.

45:13.900 --> 45:18.740
Ah, James, policemen. Many, many traditions and rituals surrounding policemen.

45:18.740 --> 45:22.790
Amongst them, if he has a gun, you must go and unbutton him,

45:22.790 --> 45:25.870
just because that says I trust you with your weapon.

45:25.870 --> 45:27.560
Go and unbutton one.

45:27.560 --> 45:28.600
Righto.

45:29.360 --> 45:30.970
No, just knock his hat off, James.

45:30.970 --> 45:32.300
They think it's funny.

45:32.300 --> 45:35.260
They often express their humour here with gunfire.

45:38.580 --> 45:42.020
We then told James we were stopping to put our wind deflectors up.

45:42.700 --> 45:44.870
But in fact, the real reason we stopped here

45:44.870 --> 45:48.270
is so that I could give him a surprise present.

45:50.070 --> 45:51.860
Oh, God! Is it an ox?

45:52.590 --> 45:54.710
Is it a gypsy? A big one?

45:54.710 --> 45:55.880
Nope.

45:56.470 --> 45:57.390
It's over there.

45:58.970 --> 46:00.170
What, some wood?

46:00.170 --> 46:02.310
In front of the wood.

46:02.310 --> 46:03.370
No!

46:03.370 --> 46:04.590
Yep, seriously.

46:05.130 --> 46:06.820
I have bought you, it's second hand,

46:06.820 --> 46:10.490
but I have bought you a Dacia Sandero.

46:11.110 --> 46:12.400
Really? Yes.

46:12.400 --> 46:14.520
Oh, mate! That's my Dacia Sandero?

46:14.520 --> 46:17.350
No piano's going to land on it, it's not a Morris Marina.

46:17.350 --> 46:18.640
I'm quite touched.

46:18.640 --> 46:19.550
That's fantastic!

46:19.550 --> 46:20.410
Can I drive it?

46:20.410 --> 46:22.730
You go and drive it while we're putting these on.

46:24.570 --> 46:26.730
He's genuinely chuffed to bits!

46:28.340 --> 46:30.820
For two years, I've been dreaming about this car,

46:30.820 --> 46:34.340
and now I was actually driving it.

46:34.340 --> 46:36.510
The Lamborghini is all very well,

46:36.510 --> 46:39.100
that's like the ultimate expression of what a car can be,

46:39.100 --> 46:41.380
but this is the essence of a car.

46:41.380 --> 46:44.430
All the bits you need, nothing more. No flim-flam.

46:45.120 --> 46:46.820
This is a bit of a faff, isn't it?

46:47.630 --> 46:52.260
Ah! A cool, refreshing, communist water.

46:53.120 --> 46:54.300
Jesus!

46:55.250 --> 46:57.870
I could buy that for Hammond,that could be his present.

46:59.560 --> 47:00.500
Listen to this!

47:03.190 --> 47:05.240
Nice throaty little warble from the engine.

47:06.010 --> 47:08.420
It's a happy car. Dacia Sandero.

47:09.450 --> 47:10.600
That is an excellent present.

47:10.600 --> 47:12.120
I don't know what he was thinking of there,

47:12.120 --> 47:13.720
cos his presents are supposed to be irritating,

47:13.720 --> 47:17.480
but that's not irritating. That's superb!

47:18.240 --> 47:19.830
Could you see anything in your screen?

47:19.830 --> 47:21.580
Nothing.

47:21.580 --> 47:22.640
When the roof's down?

47:22.640 --> 47:24.690
As soon as the roof's down, the slightest hint of sun, it's gone.

47:24.690 --> 47:26.190
-You're back! -Ya.

47:26.190 --> 47:27.120
How is it?

47:27.120 --> 47:30.050
-And? -Good fun, basic, small, sporty.

47:30.050 --> 47:33.280
But you haven't got the little side joke, have you?

47:33.280 --> 47:34.120
What?

47:34.120 --> 47:35.610
Well, you can't take it back hand luggage.

47:35.610 --> 47:36.700
I'll drive it back.

47:36.700 --> 47:37.500
All the way? Yeah.

47:37.500 --> 47:40.040
It took 2 and a half days to get here...

47:40.040 --> 47:41.310
No!

47:43.390 --> 47:44.410
Stop!

47:45.220 --> 47:46.530
Stop!

47:46.530 --> 47:48.150
My car's parked there.

47:49.520 --> 47:50.560
You're supposed to look.

47:50.560 --> 47:52.440
Look! Mirrors!

47:55.250 --> 47:58.160
My arse! You just backed straight into it, man!

47:58.160 --> 48:00.130
Why did you leave it parked behind a lorry?

48:00.130 --> 48:01.780
I didn't know there was anybody in it.

48:01.780 --> 48:03.700
I was leaving it out of shot.

48:04.530 --> 48:06.900
I've only had it about half an hour. Yeah.

48:06.900 --> 48:10.540
I think he was saying in Hungarian, or whatever it is,

48:11.500 --> 48:13.420
it's my fault for parking the car.

48:13.420 --> 48:14.560
Well... Probably was.

48:14.560 --> 48:15.740
It sort of is.

48:17.550 --> 48:19.450
Jeez!

48:20.730 --> 48:21.790
Oh, well.

48:22.370 --> 48:24.460
You'd have used it for work and everything, wouldn't you?

48:24.460 --> 48:25.580
Why don't you go away?

48:25.580 --> 48:28.930
It would have made you happier.

48:28.930 --> 48:30.960
There is an old tradition in this country

48:30.960 --> 48:33.390
that on the third Wednesday of every month,

48:33.390 --> 48:35.140
which is what today is,

48:35.140 --> 48:36.390
people with a black T-shirt on

48:36.390 --> 48:39.100
and a picture of a stupid Russian sparkplug shut up.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.540
I liked the Dacia Sandero.

48:45.110 --> 48:46.650
It was honest and simple.

48:46.650 --> 48:48.400
It was refreshing.

48:49.680 --> 48:50.870
It's broken.

48:52.260 --> 48:54.090
As we travelled further west,

48:54.090 --> 48:58.010
the high-tech modern Romania we knew ran out.

49:00.610 --> 49:04.360
It's getting a bit more Borat round here.

49:01.360 --> 49:04.970
{\a6\fn??????\c&HFFDC35&\fs16} 

49:04.970 --> 49:06.450
It's gypsy country here.

49:07.080 --> 49:10.190
I am told they can be a bit violent

49:10.190 --> 49:11.760
if they don't like the look of you.

49:12.450 --> 49:13.630
And on top of that,

49:13.630 --> 49:15.830
guess who was leading the convoy?

49:16.790 --> 49:19.530
I'm gonna take a punt on going right now.

49:20.600 --> 49:22.470
Do we know that this is the right way?

49:22.470 --> 49:25.040
Oh, sorry, Hammond, I'm just following May.

49:25.040 --> 49:27.210
You do know what you just said, don't you?

49:29.120 --> 49:31.800
This road is becoming alarmingly lumpy.

49:32.540 --> 49:34.940
I'm worried about my Reventon-style nose.

49:35.800 --> 49:37.570
The nose is too low.

49:37.570 --> 49:40.420
He's gonna have to admit he's brought the wrong car.

49:41.010 --> 49:43.630
Soon, we were really lost.

49:43.630 --> 49:45.970
They're building what can only be...

49:45.970 --> 49:46.960
Yes, it's a public execution.

49:48.220 --> 49:49.130
Where on the map does it say

49:49.130 --> 49:51.950
"Turn right at the partially built gallows?"

49:51.950 --> 49:53.190
That woman has an axe.

49:53.190 --> 49:55.080
That big woman has an axe.She has an axe.

49:56.200 --> 49:59.370
We drove deeper and deeper into Borat country.

49:59.370 --> 50:03.310
But luckily, I brought something that would help me blend in.

50:05.530 --> 50:06.760
I'm wearing this hat,

50:06.760 --> 50:09.560
so gypsies think I am one.

50:09.560 --> 50:10.810
And that's fine.

50:10.810 --> 50:12.430
I'm just a lucky gypsy.

50:13.170 --> 50:14.920
A pools-winning gypsy.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.630
James said the next turning would take us back to the main road.

50:20.280 --> 50:21.560
It didn't.

50:24.670 --> 50:25.930
Holy moly.

50:26.750 --> 50:27.880
Oh, yeah!

50:30.260 --> 50:32.450
Oh, no, wait. If you look what's behind you...

50:34.650 --> 50:36.520
The evidence is not stacking up!

50:36.520 --> 50:38.640
Is this the horse and cart? That's a horse.

50:38.640 --> 50:41.420
We wanted to hit James over the head with a hammer,

50:41.420 --> 50:43.920
but the kids beat us to it.

50:47.550 --> 50:49.130
Are you seeing this?

50:53.960 --> 50:56.630
Did you shrink the man in the car behind?

50:56.630 --> 50:58.860
Did you shrink that man, gypsies?

50:59.790 --> 51:02.130
Getting through the village was bad enough,

51:02.130 --> 51:04.900
getting out of it was even trickier.

51:05.700 --> 51:08.320
Oh, my God, you're joking!

51:10.510 --> 51:12.990
Please fall off! Please fall off! Please fall off!

51:14.060 --> 51:16.420
OK, this is certainly a Grand Tour for these cars.

51:17.400 --> 51:20.410
But with the village behind us and armed with some directions,

51:20.410 --> 51:23.290
it was plain sailing back to the main road.

51:32.750 --> 51:36.730
'He's at the end of the road with another car.'

51:38.870 --> 51:40.840
Thankfully, the damage was light.

51:40.840 --> 51:41.690
My hat!

51:41.690 --> 51:42.520
Give me a washer bottle.

51:42.520 --> 51:44.530
Yeah, it smells of detergent.

51:44.530 --> 51:46.950
Is everybody all right in that car?

51:46.950 --> 51:50.510
That's his second bit of bad luck.

51:50.510 --> 51:51.210
Whose?

51:51.210 --> 51:53.240
James's. That's his second car of the day.

51:53.950 --> 51:55.960
James... Are there any cars you won't destroy?

51:55.960 --> 51:57.870
How many cars have you destroyed today?

51:57.870 --> 52:00.020
I didn't destroy it. I stopped, as you saw.

52:00.020 --> 52:04.030
I saw you driving like an absolute maniac...

52:04.030 --> 52:04.920
Shut up!

52:04.920 --> 52:06.630
..Into this poor man's classic Dacia.

52:07.420 --> 52:09.480
Anyway, James, as you know on Top Gear...

52:10.320 --> 52:11.310
Yes, goodbye.

52:11.310 --> 52:12.440
Thank you.

52:22.070 --> 52:25.410
Our hunt for the fabled road was not going well.

52:25.410 --> 52:27.530
And then it got worse.

52:30.010 --> 52:32.540
It went dark, we couldn't find a hotel,

52:32.540 --> 52:36.110
the petrol stations were closed,and because I was very low on fuel,

52:36.110 --> 52:38.280
I found a quiet dead-end road

52:38.280 --> 52:40.900
and suggested we sleep in the cars.

52:40.900 --> 52:44.270
That put James and Richard in a bit of a mood.

52:44.960 --> 52:46.790
Listen, I can cheer you two up.

52:46.790 --> 52:49.270
Would you like some cannabis?

52:49.270 --> 52:50.720
Yes, please. Right.

52:52.390 --> 52:53.910
-Thanks. -Eh?

52:54.870 --> 52:57.090
That's cannabis. No, specifically,

52:57.090 --> 53:00.510
it says it's Swiss cannabis ice tea.

53:00.510 --> 53:01.830
That's the best sort.

53:01.830 --> 53:03.140
You can get this in petrol stations.

53:03.140 --> 53:05.360
They sell cannabis in petrol stations here?

53:05.360 --> 53:09.490
Would you like some plum liqueur in a bottle the shape of a violin?

53:09.490 --> 53:10.290
Say yes.

53:10.290 --> 53:11.850
Yes, it's just what the doctor ordered.

53:14.150 --> 53:15.610
Oh, dear...God!

53:15.610 --> 53:16.870
It gives you a fantastic natural feeling.

53:17.770 --> 53:19.610
Plum liqueur and cannabis!

53:22.480 --> 53:23.880
That's never been tried before.

53:23.880 --> 53:25.390
Give us a go.

53:26.020 --> 53:26.830
It's good.

53:26.830 --> 53:28.120
So we sleep in our cars?

53:28.120 --> 53:29.000
Yes.

53:29.660 --> 53:30.800
I haven't got a back seat.

53:30.800 --> 53:32.220
I told you,

53:32.220 --> 53:33.400
you brought the wrong car.

53:33.400 --> 53:34.800
When I chose it,

53:34.800 --> 53:37.340
I should have thought "Better get one with a crap back seat!"

53:37.340 --> 53:38.990
Just get in your car.

53:40.180 --> 53:41.940
Well, that's the plum liqueur gone!

53:43.120 --> 53:46.520
We set about our unplanned consumer test.

53:46.520 --> 53:49.430
So, it is a four-seater, they sell it as a four-seater.

53:50.020 --> 53:53.030
That must mean a human being can get in the back.

53:58.720 --> 54:00.330
Sorry! Sorry, everyone.

54:00.330 --> 54:01.520
What are you doing?

54:01.520 --> 54:02.610
It's a design fault.

54:02.610 --> 54:03.790
People are trying to sleep!

54:07.760 --> 54:09.630
I'm gonna sleep in the front.

54:35.900 --> 54:37.860
Bloody hell!

54:41.700 --> 54:43.500
Oh, sorry, mate!

54:44.650 --> 54:45.790
You sleep all right?

54:45.790 --> 54:47.320
Yeah. Yeah, well.

54:47.320 --> 54:48.450
Good.

54:48.450 --> 54:49.970
Did you use the back?

54:49.970 --> 54:50.970
No, I tried...

54:58.170 --> 54:59.800
What's that?

55:08.520 --> 55:09.520
It's a dam.

55:09.520 --> 55:11.260
It's all right, it's quite safe.

55:11.260 --> 55:12.470
I should imagine it was built by the Russians

55:12.470 --> 55:14.840
or the North Koreans. So we'll be fine.

55:15.290 --> 55:16.190
Had I known...

55:16.190 --> 55:16.990
Sorry, mate.

55:16.990 --> 55:18.760
..You'd parked us next to that,

55:18.760 --> 55:20.050
I wouldn't have enjoyed such a deep sleep.

55:20.730 --> 55:23.140
The quality of all Soviet buildings is fantastic.

55:23.140 --> 55:24.340
I'm sure that'll be...

55:26.110 --> 55:27.490
Why don't you shut up?

55:29.740 --> 55:32.980
We set off once more in search of our road.

55:35.660 --> 55:37.100
Oh, my God!

55:41.390 --> 55:42.990
Suddenly, I'm awake.

55:45.570 --> 55:48.590
And soon we reach the mountains where the road surface

55:48.590 --> 55:51.770
became as pimply as a teenager's face.

55:54.140 --> 55:56.380
Look at the road now! It's practically ploughed!

55:58.370 --> 56:01.850
This was yet another problem for James in his supercar.

56:06.670 --> 56:08.410
Please let it end!

56:10.180 --> 56:12.480
The torture went on for hours,

56:12.480 --> 56:16.430
but eventually, the mountains gave up their secret.

56:17.140 --> 56:18.010
Look!

56:18.670 --> 56:19.730
God!

56:19.730 --> 56:24.000
Ha! Ha! That's the most amazing road I've ever seen.

56:27.450 --> 56:28.870
Built in the Seventies,

56:28.870 --> 56:31.660
this is the Transfagarasan Highway.

56:32.580 --> 56:36.270
6,000 tonnes of dynamite were used to make it.

56:36.270 --> 56:39.060
And 40 lives lost.

56:43.300 --> 56:44.740
But from above,

56:44.740 --> 56:46.180
it looks like every great corner

56:46.180 --> 56:48.800
from every great racetrack in the world

56:48.800 --> 56:57.980
has been knitted together to create one unbroken grey ribbon of automotive perfection.

57:15.220 --> 57:17.420
This is what we came here for!

57:18.140 --> 57:19.530
Oh, yes!

57:19.530 --> 57:21.270
Our cars had done motorways

57:21.270 --> 57:23.540
and city centres and gypsy villages,

57:24.170 --> 57:26.290
they'd been slept in and written on,

57:26.290 --> 57:30.120
but now they had a chance to let their hair down.

57:44.130 --> 57:44.890
Oh, that's heavenly.

57:45.750 --> 57:48.890
That traction control in a setting that allows a little bit of slip.

57:58.960 --> 58:00.020
Look at that!

58:00.990 --> 58:02.910
The grip! The balance!

58:02.910 --> 58:04.620
Can't beat the work on this.

58:06.990 --> 58:08.920
But here on this road,

58:08.920 --> 58:11.850
the happiest bunny of us all, was James.

58:16.550 --> 58:18.920
I brought the right car!

58:22.190 --> 58:24.240
Lamborghini pay-back time!

58:25.540 --> 58:26.910
Oh, yeah!

58:32.710 --> 58:33.490
I have to say,

58:33.490 --> 58:36.760
this is one of the two or three best cars in the world right now.

58:41.590 --> 58:45.850
The strange thing is, those two are driving two of the others.

58:47.370 --> 58:50.510
The road just got better and better.

58:51.280 --> 58:52.320
We were wrong!

58:52.320 --> 58:54.300
This is better than the Stelvio.

58:52.300 --> 58:57.300
{\a6\fn??????\c&HFFDC35&\fs16} 

58:54.300 --> 58:56.720
This is the best road in the world.

58:58.050 --> 59:01.540
And the Romanian helicopter cameraman wasn't bad either.

59:10.350 --> 59:12.980
What a finale to our Grand Tour!

59:14.070 --> 59:15.530
Just wanna say, Romania,

59:15.530 --> 59:17.080
thank you for having us!

59:17.710 --> 59:19.330
And can we stay?

59:19.330 --> 59:22.500
For ever!

59:41.250 --> 59:42.670
Anyway...

59:43.610 --> 59:45.990
What we learned from our lengthy trip to Romania

59:45.990 --> 59:50.070
was that the Aston Martin, as I predicted at the beginning, was the best.

59:50.070 --> 59:51.760
Except it was the Lamborghini.

59:51.760 --> 59:53.380
The Ferrari was the best.

59:53.380 --> 59:58.340
Look, guys, the two people whose opinion I respect most of all

59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.470
on all matters motoring -

01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:02.500
the Stig and Tiffany Dell -

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:07.290
both say that the Aston Martin is the best car in the world right now.

01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:08.580
Well, they're both wrong.

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:10.520
Aha! Let me draw your attention to this.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.890
This is a report of our visit in one of the leading Romanian newspapers,

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:17.410
and look at the caption to this picture here.

01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:19.210
It's in Romanian, but I'll translate,

01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:20.750
"Jeremy Clarkson in the Aston Martin,

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:21.850
"is the best car in the world,

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:23.460
camera video."

01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:26.040
It doesn't say that.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.170
Yes, it does.

01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:29.250
On that bombshell,it is time to end.

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:31.340
Thank you so much for watching.Good night!
