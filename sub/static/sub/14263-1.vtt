Shh. Keep it
stealthy, guys.

14:23.361 --> 14:27.264
Yeah, those big cans
may have tin ears,
but they're sensitive.

14:27.332 --> 14:29.933
Hey! Hey, guys!
Over here!

14:31.202 --> 14:33.937
You are guilty
of trespassing
on private property.

14:34.005 --> 14:36.974
Nice going, loudmouth.
You led 'em right to us!

14:37.042 --> 14:41.878
Uh, guys, don't look now,
but I think our biggest problem
is right behind us!

14:45.850 --> 14:48.753
[ Gasps ]
No!

14:49.788 --> 14:51.555
I am Dregg,

14:51.622 --> 14:55.259
Supreme Warlord
of the Seven Galaxies.

14:55.327 --> 14:59.463
I've come to conquer
this miserable world,

14:59.530 --> 15:02.967
starting with you!

15:09.240 --> 15:13.177
Bow before your new lord
and master, deviants.

15:13.244 --> 15:15.846
Go suck an egg,
you alien sleazoid!

15:15.914 --> 15:18.315
Oh, now, surely
a little bowing
couldn't hurt.

15:18.383 --> 15:20.318
Insolent insects!

15:20.385 --> 15:23.253
You've just sealed
your doom.

15:26.357 --> 15:29.727
Come on, guys!
You've got some slick ninja
moves to handle this, right?

15:29.794 --> 15:32.129
- Hai!
- Actually, we do.

15:32.196 --> 15:34.832
- First thing
Splinter taught us.
- And what's that?

15:36.735 --> 15:38.468
[ Turtles ]
Know when to duck!

15:44.910 --> 15:47.144
You call that
a cool ninja move?

15:47.212 --> 15:50.714
Don't knock it, dude!
It worked.
Hit 'em, guys!

15:50.782 --> 15:52.649
[ Yelling ]

15:58.723 --> 16:01.725
[ Grunts ]
Eat foot, fists-for-brains!

16:03.127 --> 16:04.595
Hi-yeow!

16:07.165 --> 16:09.567
[ Shouting ]

16:16.841 --> 16:18.008
Come to papa!

16:19.511 --> 16:20.777
Yah!

16:20.845 --> 16:23.046
They've damaged
the steering controls!

16:23.114 --> 16:27.017
[ Alarm Shrieking ]
Shake off the two on the ship,
and we'll destroy them all.

16:27.084 --> 16:28.385
Yes, Lord Dregg.

16:30.221 --> 16:32.956
[ Grunting ]
Yaah!

16:34.792 --> 16:36.726
[ All Shouting ]

16:36.794 --> 16:38.161
Now finish them!

16:38.229 --> 16:40.864
I cannot. Tracking systems
are nonfunctional.

16:40.932 --> 16:42.566
[ Grunting ]

16:42.634 --> 16:45.435
Man, you guys gotta
lay off the pepperoni.

16:45.503 --> 16:48.405
Time to terminate.
Affirmative.

16:51.876 --> 16:53.644
No!

17:00.084 --> 17:02.018
Thanks for the assist,
Carter.

17:02.086 --> 17:05.588
Yeah. I hate to admit it,
but that was a slick play.

17:05.656 --> 17:10.261
Whoa! Take a rain check
on those high fives, dudes!
Look!

17:10.328 --> 17:12.329
Man, don't these
robo-creeps ever quit?

17:12.396 --> 17:16.700
This escapade
is taking far too much time.
I must get that gold.

17:16.768 --> 17:19.236
Once I use it to repair
my ship's weaponry,

17:19.304 --> 17:21.738
I can dominate this planet
by force!

17:21.806 --> 17:25.875
Without functional weapons,
those mutant Turtles will
continue to be a problem.

17:25.943 --> 17:29.546
Not if I have a bargaining chip.

17:33.318 --> 17:34.718
Heads up! Yaah!

17:39.424 --> 17:43.260
- Carter, look out!
- [ Screams ]

17:43.328 --> 17:45.428
Dudes,
we've gotta help him!

17:45.496 --> 17:49.566
Now to ensure
those Turtles stay busy--

17:52.137 --> 17:53.938
[ Turtles ]
Whoa!

17:57.141 --> 17:59.109
Weapons systems enhanced.

17:59.177 --> 18:02.279
Affirmative. Open fire.

18:02.347 --> 18:03.914
[ All Screaming ]

18:05.484 --> 18:08.452
Yaaah!

18:18.763 --> 18:20.430
[ Murmuring ]
[ Man ]
What's going on?

18:20.498 --> 18:22.599
[ Man #2 ]
I don't know.
What's happening up there?

18:22.667 --> 18:24.134
I don't know.
I couldn't see!

18:25.970 --> 18:28.806
Looks like those goons
took Carter. But why?

18:28.873 --> 18:31.074
[ Leonardo ]
I don't know, but we've
got bigger problems.

18:31.142 --> 18:33.744
We've gotta take these
king-sized creeps down.

18:33.811 --> 18:35.379
Now!

18:38.517 --> 18:39.884
Yaah!

18:42.954 --> 18:44.254
[ Beeps ]

18:46.224 --> 18:49.259
Partner self-destruct
sequence initiated.

18:49.326 --> 18:51.828
Leonardo, get away
from that thing!

18:54.265 --> 18:57.801
Those things must be
programmed to self-destruct
if they're defeated.

18:57.869 --> 19:00.237
You mean they're
like walking bombs?

19:00.304 --> 19:02.039
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

19:02.106 --> 19:05.342
[ Leonardo ] Donatello,
is there some way you could
take control of that thing?

19:05.410 --> 19:07.244
Well, if we could get
at its circuits,

19:07.311 --> 19:10.614
I might be able to patch them
into my lab computer
with the Turtle-com.

19:10.682 --> 19:14.618
I can handle that.
Raphael, you and Michelangelo
keep it distracted.

19:14.686 --> 19:17.454
Oh, sure.
Give us the fun jobs.

19:28.165 --> 19:30.100
Step it up,
Donatello.

19:30.167 --> 19:31.468
[ Beeping ]

19:33.304 --> 19:36.272
I've got it
under my control.
Climb aboard!

19:37.642 --> 19:39.376
Follow that ship!

19:39.443 --> 19:42.112
Man, I just hope Carter's
doing okay.

19:46.584 --> 19:51.688
[ Grunting ]
Man! This claw
is crushing me!

19:51.756 --> 19:54.191
Gotta be strong.

19:54.259 --> 19:56.293
Gotta be strong!

19:56.361 --> 19:59.396
Gotta be strong!

19:59.464 --> 20:03.266
Whoa. What's...
happening to me?

20:03.334 --> 20:06.402
I'm changing. I'm...

20:08.940 --> 20:10.573
strong!

20:20.986 --> 20:23.587
[ Coughing, Groaning ]

20:23.655 --> 20:26.490
I'm getting sleepy.

20:29.894 --> 20:32.629
In a few moments,
I will have all the gold
I need...

20:32.697 --> 20:35.032
to repair my <i> Dreggnaught's</i>
weapons systems.

20:35.099 --> 20:39.269
And then the Earth
shall be mine.

20:39.271 --> 20:42.739
[ Loud Crash ]
Aah! No!

20:42.807 --> 20:46.476
Hey, Dregg-face,
we're back!

20:46.544 --> 20:49.045
We don't mean
to bring you down
or anything--

20:49.114 --> 20:51.315
But we're here
to bring you down!

20:51.383 --> 20:53.116
Hee-yah!

21:00.824 --> 21:02.960
Gotta stop
those techno-creeps.

[ Beeping ]

21:06.597 --> 21:10.667
[ All Screaming ]

21:15.006 --> 21:20.009
Now, to start
the autodestruct.
[ Beeps ]

21:28.486 --> 21:31.621
All right, you space case.
Hand over the kid!

21:31.689 --> 21:34.658
You meddling mutants
will share your friend's fate.

but he might be right.

21:51.275 --> 21:53.643
It's another
mutant dude!

[ Hi-Tech Screams ]

22:03.420 --> 22:06.022
- What do you think
<i>you're</i> doing?
- [ Beeps ]

No. Wait.
We've gotta get Carter!

You wretched deviants
will pay for this!

22:21.005 --> 22:24.508
Hey. What happened to
that humongo mutant dude?

22:24.576 --> 22:27.310
[ Raphael ]
We'll deal with him later.
We've gotta find Carter.

22:28.912 --> 22:33.283
Man, we searched
that wreckage for hours and
didn't find a trace of him.

22:33.351 --> 22:38.155
I think we have to face it.
There's no way Carter could
have survived that crash.

22:38.223 --> 22:41.391
- Somebody mention my name?
- Dude! You're alive!

22:41.458 --> 22:43.660
But--
But it's impossible.

22:43.728 --> 22:46.863
Man, how did you escape
that explosion?

22:47.932 --> 22:49.866
Yeah. Hey!

22:49.934 --> 22:52.268
A good ninja can get
out of any tight spot.

22:52.336 --> 22:56.607
I gotta hand it to you, Carter.
You've really got what it takes.

22:56.609 --> 22:59.242
Yep. And you
really came through
in that battle.

22:59.309 --> 23:01.444
I tried to tell you
I've got skills.

23:01.579 --> 23:05.615
Any young man who could survive
such overwhelming odds...

23:05.683 --> 23:08.117
surely has unusual powers...

23:08.185 --> 23:11.221
which are unknown
even to me.

23:11.289 --> 23:13.824
I am ready
to begin my training,

23:13.891 --> 23:16.126
I have much to learn
from you.

to learn from <i> you,</i> Carter.
