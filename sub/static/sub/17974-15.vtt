01:08.102 --> 01:11.437
For it was exactly
three years ago to the day

01:11.439 --> 01:15.207
that I gave up
my lifelong dream
of moving to L.A.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.042
and being a scout
for the Dodgers

01:17.044 --> 01:19.945
so that I could stay here
in Stoolbend...

We look so young.

When did we take this?

01:33.460 --> 01:35.594
Well, I'm off to work.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.962
Oh, wait a minute.

01:36.964 --> 01:38.697
This isn't what I do
for a living.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.532
Know why?

01:40.534 --> 01:44.570
Because three years ago today,
I gave up my dream

01:44.572 --> 01:48.207
so that a sad divorce's
two at-risk children

01:48.209 --> 01:50.375
could have a chance
at their dreams.

01:50.377 --> 01:52.744
Yeah, right. My dream
is to have a fat man

01:52.746 --> 01:54.713
lie on top of my mom
every night.

01:54.715 --> 01:59.118
What I do when your mother
sleeps is my business.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.820
Kids, mama's gonna do
something extremely rash

02:01.822 --> 02:03.989
and spiteful
without considering
the consequences

02:03.991 --> 02:05.924
of her actions on her family.

02:05.926 --> 02:08.093
(kids cheering)

02:08.095 --> 02:10.462
Happy anniversary!

02:10.464 --> 02:12.664
I got you a gift.

02:12.666 --> 02:13.999
I'll give you a hint.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.901
It's the dream
you gave up for me.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.336
I'm going back
to  <i>The Family Guy?</i>

02:17.338 --> 02:19.238
I'm going to be
on     <i>The Family G</i>again?

02:19.240 --> 02:21.073
No. Look.

02:21.075 --> 02:22.141
(cheering)

02:22.143 --> 02:23.842
(gasps) Donna!

02:23.844 --> 02:25.344

02:25.346 --> 02:26.845
Bye-bye!

02:26.847 --> 02:28.647
No, we're all going.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.450
I felt so bad about all
you've given up for us,

02:31.452 --> 02:33.152
so I called the Dodgers
and convinced them

02:33.154 --> 02:35.354
to hire you as a scout--
don't ask me how--

02:35.356 --> 02:37.422
and I quit our jobs,
pulled the kids from school

02:37.424 --> 02:39.024
and rented the house
to Reverend Jenkins.

02:39.026 --> 02:42.094
And because he lay
with an Olive Garden hostess,

02:42.096 --> 02:44.796
the reverend was cast
from his home

02:44.798 --> 02:47.966
and forced to live
in this furnished sublet

02:47.968 --> 02:51.003
with carpet stains,
which he marked
on the contract

02:51.005 --> 02:53.772
so he shall receive
his full deposit!

not the terrible remake.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.060
Well, since you all
did the packing,

03:15.062 --> 03:17.696
it's probably best
that you do the unpacking.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.032
I am off to the ballpark.

03:20.034 --> 03:23.268
Today, I become a "Doyer."

03:24.737 --> 03:26.805
Trust me, we'll be
back in Stoolbend

03:26.807 --> 03:28.740
as soon as Cleveland learns
that being a scout

03:28.742 --> 03:31.243
is nothing like the
romantic fantasy in his head.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.414

Hey, hey, aren't you
a little old to be a rookie?

03:49.163 --> 03:51.597
Rookie?
I don't think so, Ethier.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.165
Coming at you, Matt Kemp.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.833

Get that fat fool!

Now, get the hell
out of here!

04:20.928 --> 04:22.361
We got a game to play.

05:28.128 --> 05:31.463
the CW was lying to me
about these places,

05:31.465 --> 05:34.032

telling the truth.

with the brooding artist.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.540

And there's the math teacher

05:41.542 --> 05:44.343
who paid for that
bookish freshman's abortion.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.044
Which means I'm...

05:46.046 --> 05:49.614
the new girl who's brought in
to stir things up.

06:48.007 --> 06:49.908
I kind of hoped my office

06:49.910 --> 06:52.110
would be closer
to the stadium.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.945
Well, I hoped
our new scout

06:53.947 --> 06:55.580
would be a talking
pair of breasts.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.015
You're salty.

Now, I need you

high school baseball games.

07:03.289 --> 07:05.457

Kid's last name

07:36.890 --> 07:38.623
and props and such?

07:38.625 --> 07:40.125
I'm a paparazzo.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.994
Tonight, I'm covering
the Teen Mom Choice Awards.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.896
Batman told me
I could hang out with him

if I bring him a sandwich
and a change of underwear.

You did?
Oh, baby, to be honest,

08:02.783 --> 08:04.583
I was skeptical
about moving to L.A.,

08:04.585 --> 08:06.952
but look at us all happy
and thriving out here.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.921
Yay. We're all
living our dreams.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.857

all the way home.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.975
I am called Cleveland.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.177
I am a scout
for the Dodgers.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.812
Oh, I love baseball.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.981
The hitting,
the throwing,

08:35.983 --> 08:37.215
the umpires.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.384
"You're out, Babe Ruth!"

08:39.386 --> 08:42.787
I'm an aspiring
actress, obviously.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.890
Well, good luck succeeding
in something

08:44.892 --> 08:47.459
that every mildly attractive
former cheerleader

08:47.461 --> 08:49.027
thinks they have a shot at.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.796
Aw, that's
the nicest thing anyone

08:51.798 --> 08:54.232
in Los Angeles
has ever said to anyone.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.001
Good luck to you, too.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.470
I'm going to need
a lot more than luck.

08:58.472 --> 09:01.239
Turns out my dream job
is way different

09:01.241 --> 09:03.074

it would be.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.210
Well, don't give up

09:11.018 --> 09:13.818
Don't give up
on your dream, either.

09:13.820 --> 09:14.986
Or do.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.154
Do.

09:18.190 --> 09:21.426
What? You're too good
to take a picture

09:21.428 --> 09:23.995
with Catwoman
for five bucks?

09:26.365 --> 09:28.333
Holy shoplifting, Batman!

09:28.335 --> 09:30.368
And right in front
of you guys, no less.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.937
This is going to be epic.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.506
Go get 'em, superheroes!

09:38.945 --> 09:40.612
(moans)

09:40.614 --> 09:41.880
(grunting)

09:41.882 --> 09:44.416
My heroes have lost their way.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.385
The world needs heroes.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.054
The world needs you.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.056
So, who's with me?

09:51.058 --> 09:52.424
Okay.
I'm in.

09:52.426 --> 09:53.959
Sure. Why not?

09:53.961 --> 09:56.194
I don't know how to flush you!

09:56.196 --> 09:59.431
Together, we will fight
for justice in L.A.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.366
and beyond!

10:03.903 --> 10:05.870
(grunts)

10:09.976 --> 10:11.543
All right, scouts.

10:11.545 --> 10:13.912
What do we think of that
high school kid, Nate Schafer?

10:13.914 --> 10:16.648
We project his BABIP
to return to his mean,

10:16.650 --> 10:18.617
increasing his WARP by...
Can it, nerd.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.753
GINA:
<i>Don't give up on your dream.</i>

10:21.755 --> 10:26.291
Gentlemen, I think I have
what you're looking for.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.394
I've discovered some players,
who, with a little polish,

10:29.396 --> 10:32.430
I truly believe
could be difference makers.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.898
Introducing...

10:33.900 --> 10:37.335
Joey Votto, Jimmy Rollins
and David Ortiz.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.304
Hmm?

10:39.306 --> 10:40.739
Hey, good game
last week.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.507
Hi, fellas.
I'm Jimmy Rollins.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.843
(laughing)

10:44.845 --> 10:46.811
Cleveland, you do
know that these guys

10:46.813 --> 10:48.947
are current major-league
players on other teams.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.349
I offered them
a billion dollars.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.618
Don't make me look
like an (bleep).

10:53.620 --> 10:55.453
So, there's not
a billion dollars?

10:55.455 --> 10:57.122
Man, I wish you had
told me that,

10:57.124 --> 10:59.190
because I just bought
an aircraft carrier.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.259
An aircraft carrier?
(chuckles)

11:01.261 --> 11:03.161
They'll never
take that back.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.963
Next time,
sign the credit card
bill with your wrong hand

11:04.965 --> 11:06.631
so you can tell them
it wasn't you.

11:06.633 --> 11:07.966
Good one, Joey.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.635
Did you know left-handed
pitchers are called southpaws?

11:10.637 --> 11:12.370
Oh, come on!

11:12.372 --> 11:14.105
Cleveland, you
would be so fired

11:14.107 --> 11:15.807
if your wife didn't
still have pictures

11:15.809 --> 11:18.043
of me and Marge Schott
horseplaying in the shower.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.277
Yuck.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.379
And from now on, your
job is to clean up

11:21.381 --> 11:24.349
all the horseplaying
mess in the showers.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.384
Hey, as long as
we're in Los Angeles,

11:26.386 --> 11:28.453
want to go visit the
world-famous Tar Pits?

11:28.455 --> 11:30.221
No.
I went yesterday.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.790
It was awesome.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.692
There was an ice cream cart.
Mmm.

11:33.694 --> 11:34.993
I'll go.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.195
I'm not riding
with a stranger.
Aw.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.797
Every time you get
on an airplane,

11:38.799 --> 11:39.898
you're riding
with a stranger.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.032
You don't know the pilot.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.667
That's a good point.
You know what?

11:42.669 --> 11:44.135
I don't want to go.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.837
I need to work
on my scouting.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.238
(chuckles)
Ya think?
A-doy.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.544
If y'all want to meet my pig,
I wanna hear ya say,

11:52.546 --> 11:54.579
"Suuuweeeee!"

11:54.581 --> 11:56.481
ALL:
Suuuuweeeeeeee!

11:56.483 --> 11:58.917
(pig squeals)

11:58.919 --> 12:00.418
(cheering)

12:00.420 --> 12:01.586
(clanging)

12:01.588 --> 12:03.755
Hey, farmhands,
someone's trying to get

12:03.757 --> 12:06.057
Old MacDonna on the ol' horn.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.992
Howdy, partner!

12:07.994 --> 12:09.661
Donna, hey.

12:09.663 --> 12:11.830
Just calling you while
walking the ball field,

12:11.832 --> 12:14.666
living "la dreama loca."

12:14.668 --> 12:16.367
Been scouting
so many guys today,

12:16.369 --> 12:18.603
you'd think I was
in West Hollywood.

12:18.605 --> 12:21.372
Sorry, but Old MacDonna
can't chitchat

12:21.374 --> 12:24.576
because it's time to put
a piece of straw in my teeth.

12:26.178 --> 12:28.113
(cheering)

12:28.115 --> 12:29.514
(camera shutters snapping,
crowd muttering)

12:29.516 --> 12:32.083
Alec. Alec. Alec.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.419
So, my guy calls me
and says, he says,

12:34.421 --> 12:38.523
"Megan Fox's plane is touching
down at LAX in an hour."

12:38.525 --> 12:41.059
So, you know me,
I says to him, I says,

12:41.061 --> 12:43.528
"Unless her plane's
touching down in 2008,

12:43.530 --> 12:44.729
I'm not interested."

12:44.731 --> 12:45.930
(chuckles)

12:45.932 --> 12:48.833
Tyra. Tyra. Tyra.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.371
(moaning sigh)

12:53.373 --> 12:54.739
(horn beeps outside)

12:54.741 --> 12:57.575
You know what?
You need some cheering up.

12:57.577 --> 13:00.311
I'm going to take you to my
favorite place in Los Angeles.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.247
The house where
Sharon Tate was killed?

13:02.249 --> 13:03.481
What? No.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.749
Just come with me.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.384
(pigeons cooing)

13:06.386 --> 13:08.620
This is the Grove.

13:08.622 --> 13:09.888
(trolley car dings)

13:11.490 --> 13:15.260
Wow, it's like a small town
right in the middle of L.A.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.095
It probably reminds you
of back home.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.763
What?!

13:18.765 --> 13:20.732
I-I said it probably
reminds you of back home.

13:20.734 --> 13:22.967
Oh. I thought you
said "black home."

13:22.969 --> 13:25.937
A little pond!
My town has one of those!

13:25.939 --> 13:28.673
And a trolley, just like
the one on Main Street

13:28.675 --> 13:31.309
that they shut down after
it crushed four kids!

13:31.311 --> 13:33.912
Ah! A disproportionate
number of Asians!

13:33.914 --> 13:35.814
Just like we fear
in Stoolbend!

13:35.816 --> 13:38.850
Wow, Cleveland, in the three
days I've known you,

13:38.852 --> 13:42.020
and the two times I saw you
within those three days,

13:42.022 --> 13:43.922
I've never seen you
this happy.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.291
Seems to me your dream
was what you already had.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.660
You should go back
to your small town.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.795
And if you like
baseball so much,

13:50.797 --> 13:52.864
why don't you be
a high school baseball coach?

13:52.866 --> 13:54.999
You could get another job
to pay the bills like,

13:55.001 --> 13:56.935
I don't know,
cable installing.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.303
Are you a witch?

13:58.305 --> 13:59.971
What?
You're right.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.841
I need to get my
family black home.

14:03.943 --> 14:05.510
(grunts)
Help!

14:05.512 --> 14:07.579
That man just stole my purse!

14:11.951 --> 14:14.385
Look, uh, I don't want
no horrible-smelling trouble.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.356
(crowd cheering)

14:20.292 --> 14:22.861
Thank you, um...?

14:22.863 --> 14:25.496
Call me Juniorman!

14:25.498 --> 14:27.298
And I'm sure we'll be
seeing you again,

14:27.300 --> 14:29.534
as you are old and frail
and are sure to be

14:29.536 --> 14:31.636
repeatedly victimized.

14:35.474 --> 14:38.243
Super Friends,
I am so proud of you.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.245
Think of all
the good we've done.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.380
Now, from this vantage point,

14:42.382 --> 14:44.849
we can find our next crime
in progress.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.885
(blood-curdling scream,
gunshots)

14:46.887 --> 14:48.419
(chain saw revs, screaming)

14:48.421 --> 14:50.421
Let's go!
Let's go!

14:51.891 --> 14:53.324
(echoing thuds)

14:54.660 --> 14:58.563
Hmm, maybe I'm more
of a supervillain.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.202
Sweet Plantains and
Donna Entertains, please hold.

15:04.204 --> 15:07.405
Sweet Plantains and Donna
Entertains, please hold.

15:09.341 --> 15:11.576
I'm looking for...

15:14.413 --> 15:17.015
Donna, listen,
I don't think L.A. is my bag.

15:18.217 --> 15:19.584
Who the hell are you?!

15:19.586 --> 15:20.919
Howdy, partner.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.287
I'm Old MacDonna.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.022
What the...? Mmm, mmm...

15:24.024 --> 15:26.090
(whimpering)

15:27.059 --> 15:28.660
Donna?

15:31.096 --> 15:32.697
Oh, it is you.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.966
But why does everyone
here look like you?

15:34.968 --> 15:37.068
Oh, these are the
Old MacDonnas-in-training.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.269
Now, I can personally work

15:38.271 --> 15:39.737
with the Amy Adamses
of the world,

15:39.739 --> 15:40.972
while the B-team
can work with

15:40.974 --> 15:42.206
the Jaime Presslys
of the world.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.975
And the C-team...

15:43.977 --> 15:45.710
can work
with Melissa Rivers.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.578
Melissa Rivers has kids?

15:47.580 --> 15:50.048
Oh, they must be
so small and loud

15:50.050 --> 15:51.816
and living off
their grandmother.

15:51.818 --> 15:54.919
Listen, Donna,
scouting isn't my dream.

15:54.921 --> 15:57.655
My dream is the life
I hated back home.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.457
So I've packed up
our apartment,

15:59.459 --> 16:00.925
and we're heading
back toni...

16:00.927 --> 16:02.560
What the hell is this?!

16:02.562 --> 16:03.761
Arabica beans?!

16:03.763 --> 16:05.296
I said Kona!

16:05.298 --> 16:07.065
Maybe I should just
move to Burbank, huh?

16:07.067 --> 16:09.500
Is that what you think of me?
I should move to Burbank,

16:09.502 --> 16:11.169
hang out at
Papoo's Hot Dog Show

16:11.171 --> 16:12.737
which is a restaurant
in Burbank?

16:12.739 --> 16:14.605
I don't know how they
ran things down at  <i>Ellen,</i>

16:14.607 --> 16:16.007
but that (bleep)
don't fly here.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.909
I'm Old Mac-(bleep)-Donna!

16:17.911 --> 16:20.278
Whoa, Donna, calm down.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.246
Now, tell me
where this Papoo's is.

16:22.248 --> 16:24.615
Look,
Cleveland, I came out here
to support your dream.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.985
Now it's your turn
to support mine.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.419
We're staying in L.A.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.355
Now, I got to go
train these idiots.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.423
(blows short note)
All right, idiots,

16:32.425 --> 16:34.359
when is she coming
'round that mountain?

16:34.361 --> 16:36.594
ALL:
When she comes!

16:36.596 --> 16:40.999
(playing "She'll Be Coming
'Round the Mountain")

16:45.371 --> 16:48.306
Hey, so how did it
go with Donna?

16:48.308 --> 16:50.041
She doesn't want
to go back.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.342
She's turned into some kind

16:51.344 --> 16:53.378
of Katherine Heigl-esque
monster.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.380
Oh, Cleveland, she
can't be that bad.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.547
You're right.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.316
Donna has comedic timing.

16:58.318 --> 17:01.519
But she's not the woman
I fell in love with.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.221
(gasps)
What happened to you?

17:03.223 --> 17:06.524
Let's just say
the Lily Tomlin nip-slip

17:06.526 --> 17:09.127
was not worth it.

17:09.129 --> 17:11.562
Hold up, Rallo.
I'll catch a ride with you.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.231
I'm on my way
to my first all-girl,

17:13.233 --> 17:15.666
teen make-out party
for sweeps week.

17:15.668 --> 17:18.369
And I just killed four people.

17:20.139 --> 17:22.373
Wow, your whole
family is awful.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.541
But they're not!

17:23.543 --> 17:25.143
I don't know
what's happened to them!

17:25.145 --> 17:26.878
L.A. happened
to them, Cleveland.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.746
And it'll happen
to you, too.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.648
Unless you get out now.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.016
I'm sorry I slapped you.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.918
I just came back from
my soap opera class.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.487
Your performance was forced
and unbelievable.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.724
But you've given me...

17:39.726 --> 17:41.826
an idea!

17:44.363 --> 17:46.831
Listen,
pig, you can crash here
for the night,

17:46.833 --> 17:48.499
but if you're still here
in the morning,

17:48.501 --> 17:49.834
Junior's going to eat you.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.235
You should leave now.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.071
Hello, family.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.172
Cleveland?

17:54.174 --> 17:55.706
Are you in Stoolbend?

17:55.708 --> 17:57.909
Yeah, tried to tell you all
I was leaving,

17:57.911 --> 17:59.377
but you were too busy.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.546
I just couldn't bring myself

18:01.548 --> 18:04.282
to miss Mama Franklin's
Peach Pie Bake Off.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.584
We missed Mama Franklin's
Peach Pie Bake Off?

18:06.586 --> 18:07.752
No!

18:07.754 --> 18:09.353
Yup, had three slices.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.589
You sure did, honey.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.191
You're my peach pie.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.692
Oh-ho-ho.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.295
And, Rallo, look who wanted
to say hi.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.031
Hey, Rallo. Mrs. Lowenstein
announced that today

18:20.033 --> 18:22.366
was bubblegum day and
we were allowed to have

18:22.368 --> 18:23.568
bubblegum at school.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.203
And we found a gun.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.471
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.738
What kind of bubblegum?

18:27.740 --> 18:29.373
Oh, and, Donna,
there's a few people

18:29.375 --> 18:31.142
who wanted to say hi to you.

18:31.144 --> 18:32.477
ALL:
Hi, Donna!

18:32.479 --> 18:33.611
Aw.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.979
See that, Donna?

18:34.981 --> 18:37.448
Back home,
everyone knows your name.

18:38.317 --> 18:39.750
Man, what am I doing

18:39.752 --> 18:41.552
wasting my life
chasing celebrities?

18:41.554 --> 18:43.254
I ain't Dr. Drew.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.289
Yeah, and they're
making me be friends

18:45.291 --> 18:47.058
with the girl
in the wheelchair.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.993
I killed four people.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.561
Well, we got to go.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.830
Having a block party
with all our friends.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.065
Don't worry, Cleveland.

18:54.067 --> 18:56.167
I'd love to join you
in the sack race.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.301
What the he...?

18:57.303 --> 18:58.836
Is that the skinny bitch
from the trash cans?

18:58.838 --> 19:00.071
That is me!

19:00.073 --> 19:01.906
(gasps)
Someone recognized me!

19:01.908 --> 19:04.609
All right, gonna go jump
in the sack with Gina.

19:04.611 --> 19:05.676
Bye-bye.

19:05.678 --> 19:06.978
Cleveland, wait.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.779
I just want to go home.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.915
Me, too.
We all do.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.950
I'm clicking my heels.

19:12.952 --> 19:16.020
(deep rumbling)

19:16.022 --> 19:18.322
ALL: Earthquake!
(pig squeals)

19:18.324 --> 19:20.091
Damn this city!

19:20.093 --> 19:22.994
Damn it all to hell!

19:30.502 --> 19:32.737
(fanfare music plays)

19:34.940 --> 19:36.541
What's... what's going on?

19:36.543 --> 19:38.209
Hollywood magic, Donna.

19:38.211 --> 19:41.812
We built a set out of Gina's
surprisingly big apartment.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.515
But... but all of our friends
from Stoolbend...

19:44.517 --> 19:45.616
Actors.

19:45.618 --> 19:48.986
We even got Tom Hanks
to play Lester.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.454
I like World War Two.

19:50.456 --> 19:51.656
Yeah, we noticed.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.959
(latex snapping)

19:54.961 --> 19:57.495
And thanks to the
San Diego Zoo

19:57.497 --> 20:00.364
for providing
"Tim and Arianna."

20:00.366 --> 20:02.967
(ferocious roaring)

20:02.969 --> 20:05.002
Oh, Cleveland, I'm sorry.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.171
I must have lost my mind.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.307
I became what I hate
most in the world:

20:09.309 --> 20:11.676
a successful,
entrepreneurial woman.

20:11.678 --> 20:14.378
We got to get the hell
back to Stoolbend.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.847
Thank you for showing me
the light, baby.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.082
Well, don't thank me.

20:18.084 --> 20:19.684
Thank "Gina."

20:19.686 --> 20:22.653
Or, should I say,
Reese Witherspoon.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.754
Thanks, Witchiepoo.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.556
I hated your last four movies.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.326
And thank you, Gina,
for helping put this together.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.328
I'm sorry I didn't cast you
as yourself,

20:30.330 --> 20:33.264
but your audition just wasn't
where it needed to be.

20:33.266 --> 20:35.166
But look at what you did.

20:35.168 --> 20:37.568
You designed the sets,
you wrote the script,

20:37.570 --> 20:40.171
you produced this thing
from top to bottom.

20:40.173 --> 20:42.573
Your future
is behind the camera.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.442
Nah, I just want to be
a famous actor.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.944
Ugh. Let's go home,
Cleveland.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.780
There's one thing
I have to do first.

20:51.750 --> 20:56.587
(echoing): Today...
I consider Los Angeles...

20:56.589 --> 20:58.122
to be the worst place...

20:58.124 --> 21:02.026
on the face of the Earth.
(crowd cheers)
