00:01.853 --> 00:02.514
Caspere...

00:02.549 --> 00:04.153
This ain't the type of
party allows cameras.

00:04.188 --> 00:06.380
What do you think?
Some kind of blackmail?

00:06.415 --> 00:09.076
You really think
we cleared the Caspere case?

00:09.159 --> 00:11.004
I'm not a cop any more.

00:11.039 --> 00:12.230
Follow Blake.

00:12.265 --> 00:14.330
He's gotten too smooth
for my peace of mind.

00:14.365 --> 00:15.568
I can do that.

00:15.604 --> 00:17.376
These must certainly be stolen.

00:17.411 --> 00:18.694
I told the other
policeman the same.

00:18.780 --> 00:19.733
He gives me his card,

00:19.815 --> 00:21.775
says to let him know
if I hear anything.

00:21.810 --> 00:24.247
If you can get a line
on an invite, the next party.

00:24.282 --> 00:26.332
- Might be tough.
- I need to look into it.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.866
We're putting together
a special investigation

00:28.901 --> 00:31.209
- to track down Irina Rulfo.
- What's the real purpose?

00:31.244 --> 00:32.786
Uncovering evidence of collusion

00:32.821 --> 00:35.232
between Vinci PD and
any other state parties.

00:35.267 --> 00:37.182
- Frank Semyon?
- Who are you?

00:37.217 --> 00:39.436
We had an arrangement
with Santos.

00:39.471 --> 00:40.983
- Nobody's seen him.
- We heard.

00:41.018 --> 00:42.966
So it's time to ratify
our arrangement.

00:42.967 --> 00:44.115
I don't need partners.

00:44.263 --> 00:46.425
That man that you tracked down,
that was a lie?

00:49.419 --> 00:51.085
He set me up.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.961
( knocking on door )
( gun clicks )

00:52.996 --> 00:54.328
Got a problem?

00:54.363 --> 00:55.845
You and me need to talk.

You bang down my door
for a staring contest?

03:17.636 --> 03:20.705
A long time ago,

03:21.073 --> 03:23.541
you gave me a man's name
on a piece of paper.

03:24.977 --> 03:26.010
I did.

03:26.278 --> 03:27.711
Because you knew what I'd do.

03:27.946 --> 03:30.747
I knew what I'd do.

03:30.982 --> 03:32.950
I didn't know you at all.

03:33.251 --> 03:36.620
Who was he to you, that man?

03:36.821 --> 03:39.290
Me? Nobody.

03:39.557 --> 03:41.892
Some greaser crankhead.

03:42.093 --> 03:44.127
Info come to me,

03:44.328 --> 03:45.995
I pass it on.

03:46.397 --> 03:49.598
Because why not get blackmail
on a sheriff's deputy?

03:49.833 --> 03:51.667
<i>That didn't hurt.</i>

03:51.969 --> 03:54.603
But I have a sense of justice.

03:54.805 --> 03:56.239
You know that.

03:56.573 --> 03:58.174
That's why this was
so surprising.

04:02.245 --> 04:04.612
That name
on the piece of paper,

04:04.814 --> 04:06.481
whoever he was...

04:08.484 --> 04:10.953
he wasn't the man
who hurt my wife.

04:12.755 --> 04:14.089
How's that?

04:14.357 --> 04:18.326
They caught the guy last month.

04:18.493 --> 04:21.028
DNA.

04:21.296 --> 04:23.431
I didn't know about it.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.799
I thought the info was solid.

04:28.770 --> 04:30.604
So none of this
is a new development.

04:30.872 --> 04:33.107
You've never been in control.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.377
We gonna fight, Raymond?

04:37.644 --> 04:40.313
I would have been different.

04:40.647 --> 04:43.116
<i>Of all the lies</i>
<i>people tell themselves,</i>

04:43.384 --> 04:45.285
I bet that's the most common.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.786
I could have.

04:46.988 --> 04:51.656
You fucked me.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.525
I sold my soul for nothing.

04:55.395 --> 04:57.696
If you were selling,
it wasn't me buying.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.298
You wanted your hooks in a cop,

04:59.632 --> 05:01.933
so you used my wife's
fucking tragedy

05:02.202 --> 05:04.069
to get me to kill somebody.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.605
I didn't get you
to do anything.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.772
I gave you a name

05:09.041 --> 05:10.574
and you made your choice.

05:10.909 --> 05:12.676
And that choice was
in you before your wife

05:12.978 --> 05:14.345
or any of this other stuff.

05:14.646 --> 05:17.382
<i>It was always</i>
<i>there... waiting.</i>

05:19.251 --> 05:20.451
And didn't you use that man

05:20.819 --> 05:23.321
to be what you were
always waiting to become?

05:23.522 --> 05:24.688
( scoffs )

05:24.923 --> 05:28.392
This thing, your wife--

05:28.659 --> 05:31.161
Those are just excuses.

05:31.496 --> 05:33.230
<i>You think you were</i>
<i>Superman previous?</i>

05:33.498 --> 05:38.701
( scoffs )
And, hey, own it.

05:39.003 --> 05:41.804
You think I'd have done less?

05:42.205 --> 05:45.607
If that's the kind of thing
that keeps you out of heaven,

05:45.842 --> 05:47.709
I don't want to go.

05:50.880 --> 05:54.750
Who gave you the name?

05:56.219 --> 05:58.521
Guy one of my guys knew,
as I remember.

06:01.023 --> 06:03.124
Told me your story.

06:03.459 --> 06:05.660
Gave up the crankhead
talking up the rape.

06:06.062 --> 06:09.130
<i>I never heard of the dude until then.
Or you.</i>

06:11.100 --> 06:14.735
He was scum, I know that.

06:17.105 --> 06:19.306
I never even
asked him anything.

06:21.309 --> 06:23.710
That guy, I just...

06:26.981 --> 06:28.815
You want out?

06:30.418 --> 06:32.319
You're free.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.055
You ain't had the nerve
for this for a while.

06:40.927 --> 06:42.895
( clicks )

06:43.330 --> 06:46.265
<i>I don't want a shoot-out in
my fucking kitchen, Raymond.</i>

06:46.567 --> 06:49.835
And I don't want
to see you die.

06:50.103 --> 06:53.138
By me or one of my other guys.

06:56.775 --> 06:58.876
I didn't set you up.

06:59.178 --> 07:01.513
And I ain't
your suicide ticket.

07:08.786 --> 07:10.421
- <i>( camera clicking )</i>
<i>- ( Police radio chatter )</i>

07:12.757 --> 07:14.658
State lands
start at the forest.

07:14.993 --> 07:18.462
Mostly we watch
for fires and weed farms.

07:18.830 --> 07:21.232
Some of these shacks have
been here since the '30s.

07:21.633 --> 07:23.900
Tech: <i>Scene looks weeks old.
Could be a lot more.</i>

07:24.168 --> 07:25.668
Place is totally contaminated.

07:26.103 --> 07:28.171
<i>We'll process, but we might
not get anything else.</i>

07:28.506 --> 07:29.905
- You have anything now?
- The blood is female.

07:30.174 --> 07:32.375
<i>Dead gonorrhea biophages.</i>

07:32.776 --> 07:34.810
All right, I want a grid
search and a cadaver dog.

07:40.117 --> 07:42.684
Jesus Christ.
You don't have enough to do?

07:42.985 --> 07:44.786
Give this to Sonoma Sheriff's.

07:51.561 --> 07:53.762
Blake's been running girls

07:54.063 --> 07:55.864
behind your back
outside the clubs.

07:56.166 --> 07:58.732
That's not
a tremendous surprise.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.468
Ambition fucked him up.

08:00.735 --> 08:02.236
No, it's bigger than you think.

08:02.571 --> 08:05.773
He's got a special stable
with Chessani's kid.

08:06.007 --> 08:08.909
Eastern Bloc girls.

08:09.311 --> 08:12.146
Surgery at the Pitlor Clinic,
make 'em top gear.

08:12.481 --> 08:16.149
He'll fill me in on it.
Don't worry.

08:16.484 --> 08:18.618
You know about
these parties they throw?

08:18.819 --> 08:20.720
Rich men.

08:20.988 --> 08:23.890
Politicians, developers.

08:25.359 --> 08:27.760
Caspere was going
<i>to these things.</i>

08:27.995 --> 08:30.697
Deals get done.

08:30.998 --> 08:33.131
I need you to give up the man

08:33.400 --> 08:35.833
who tipped you to my rapist.

08:37.437 --> 08:40.539
Give me some time.
I'll look him up.

08:40.773 --> 08:43.008
You sure you got time?

08:44.877 --> 08:47.179
On the ropes ain't the same
thing as bleeding out.

08:47.380 --> 08:49.347
You know that.

08:49.715 --> 08:52.617
<i>I'm back in the corridor</i>
<i>and we're legit.</i>

08:52.918 --> 08:56.120
This past shit
you're worked up on,

08:56.355 --> 08:58.456
it can go away.

09:01.260 --> 09:03.661
State's following up, too.

09:03.862 --> 09:05.663
On the DL.

09:05.964 --> 09:07.831
Want my help
looking for the girl

09:08.199 --> 09:10.567
who pawned the shit
that sent us to the shoot-out.

09:10.768 --> 09:14.471
Irina Rulfo.

09:16.407 --> 09:19.276
<i>We're looking for her, too.</i>

09:21.246 --> 09:25.114
I'm gonna put
my other hand up now.

09:25.415 --> 09:27.283
Don't you fucking
shoot me, Raymond.

09:53.643 --> 09:56.311
You help me find
that hard drive,

09:56.646 --> 09:59.913
<i>I'll give you the man</i>
<i>who put you wrong.</i>

10:00.181 --> 10:01.782
Who wants the hard drive?

10:01.983 --> 10:04.017
Corporate guy.

10:07.088 --> 10:09.256
Could be a lot of sensitive
footage on that thing.

10:16.997 --> 10:19.131
Where you going now?

10:20.501 --> 10:23.369
To see about killing a man.

10:23.704 --> 10:25.938
You sit back down
with a gun on me again...

10:29.310 --> 10:31.310
don't let me see you coming.

10:34.681 --> 10:36.481
I'd like to avoid that, Frank.

10:37.883 --> 10:39.818
Good.

10:42.588 --> 10:44.523
You might be one of
the last friends I got.

10:46.426 --> 10:48.426
Wouldn't that be fucked up?

10:51.396 --> 10:54.498
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

11:22.792 --> 11:25.227
This is part of it.
Vinci, Caspere,

11:25.562 --> 11:27.028
those parties
we've been talking about.

11:27.263 --> 11:29.064
The missing girl, Vera,

11:29.432 --> 11:31.299
she made her last phone call
from that lodge a mile back.

11:31.601 --> 11:33.669
Caspere's GPS
put him right here.

11:34.070 --> 11:35.871
Now we've got a scene where
a girl's been butchered.

11:36.138 --> 11:37.439
I'm interested in collusions.

11:37.940 --> 11:39.940
And maybe those parties are where
your collusions get sealed.

11:40.275 --> 11:42.176
This is important.
Somebody died here.

11:42.478 --> 11:43.578
Somebody dies
every second of the day

11:43.979 --> 11:45.780
and they're not all lucky
enough to do it California.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.249
Uh, ladies, I've been briefed.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.117
I think we've got this
now, you don't mind.

11:50.486 --> 11:53.287
This connects to a state's
missing persons case, hm?

11:53.622 --> 11:55.122
And we'll be happy
to share our findings.

11:56.957 --> 11:59.292
You know of any parties
get thrown up here?

11:59.594 --> 12:01.995
A lodge a mile back,
off the road?

12:02.463 --> 12:05.899
No, can't say we have. It's private
property and not state forest.

12:06.166 --> 12:07.667
Sold it off a few years back.

12:07.968 --> 12:09.403
No noise in the forest?
Commotion?

12:09.737 --> 12:12.839
( sighs )
This is my scene, Miss Davis.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.574
So get to it, Sheriff.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.848
<i>( faint police radio playing )</i>

12:23.149 --> 12:24.950
Work the girls and the parties.

12:25.184 --> 12:26.585
You work the diamonds.

12:26.953 --> 12:29.021
Figure out where they
came from originally.

12:29.355 --> 12:30.688
Maybe we can finger
<i>whoever took them.</i>

12:30.856 --> 12:32.724
Velcoro?

12:32.991 --> 12:35.627
He's on the Rulfo girl.

13:28.811 --> 13:29.644
What?

13:34.484 --> 13:36.485
I thought I killed you.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.855
11 years ago.

13:41.055 --> 13:43.390
Thereabouts.

13:44.593 --> 13:46.293
Maybe I still will.

13:46.495 --> 13:48.529
That right?

13:48.763 --> 13:51.365
Who'd you really kill?

13:51.666 --> 13:54.034

There was a woman,

13:54.235 --> 13:56.870
29 years old.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.905
September 2004.

13:59.106 --> 14:01.440
An attorney.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.776
Dark brown hair.

14:04.111 --> 14:07.079
Underground
parking garage downtown.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.350
Yeah, you remember.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.219
They're saying I did
a lot of things.

14:14.453 --> 14:17.055
Got a brain condition.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.592
I forget things.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.427
( scoffs )
Huh.

14:22.762 --> 14:25.564
I feel like I should
have my lawyer here.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.499
How'd you get in to see me?

14:27.734 --> 14:29.901
She was my wife.

14:31.870 --> 14:33.738
I used to be a cop.

14:36.274 --> 14:39.744
You have no idea
what you cost me.

14:40.145 --> 14:42.246
Hey, look, man, I ain't talking
to you whatever this is about.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.915
You heard what this is about!

14:44.215 --> 14:47.551
I needed to look in your eyes.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.288
It was you.

14:53.891 --> 14:56.325
You don't even look
like him, either.

14:56.493 --> 14:58.528
Who?

14:58.896 --> 15:01.397
My eyes look same as yours,
you ask me.

15:01.632 --> 15:03.666
They're gonna burn you.

15:03.934 --> 15:05.000
That remains to be seen.

15:05.268 --> 15:07.736
You better hope they do.

15:08.004 --> 15:10.172
Key on my eyes, dipshit.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.340
See if I'm whistling Dixie.

15:12.609 --> 15:14.577
If they don't give you life,

15:14.911 --> 15:16.812
I will have every
inch of your flesh

15:17.180 --> 15:20.182
removed with a cheese grater
starting with your prick.

15:20.483 --> 15:23.117
I'll cut off your nose
and your lips.

15:23.318 --> 15:25.119
Your nuts, too.

15:25.420 --> 15:28.189
And I'll make sure you live.

15:28.457 --> 15:30.692
Hell, they give you life,

15:30.960 --> 15:32.493
I might do it anyway.

15:32.695 --> 15:35.329
Like I said.

15:37.599 --> 15:40.734
Hey.
Hey, who are you?

15:41.002 --> 15:42.469
<i>You got the wrong dude.</i>

15:42.770 --> 15:44.137
I don't even know you, man.

15:44.338 --> 15:46.773
You know me.

15:47.041 --> 15:49.876
You just didn't know you did.

15:57.183 --> 16:00.653
When you said blue diamonds,
I remembered something.

16:00.854 --> 16:02.855
'92, the riots.

16:03.189 --> 16:05.491
Bad time to be in
the insurance business.

16:05.792 --> 16:07.192
This could be the same stones.

16:07.527 --> 16:09.461
Two and a half million
in blue diamonds,

16:09.830 --> 16:12.296
Peruzzi-cut.
That's what you got, I think.

16:12.632 --> 16:15.399
<i>Sable Fine Jewelers</i>
<i>in Hollywood.</i>

16:15.701 --> 16:18.803
There was a robbery
April 30, 1992.

16:21.641 --> 16:23.675
Man: You got to understand
what it was like back then.

16:23.909 --> 16:27.445
Fires starting everywhere.

16:27.713 --> 16:29.579
Snipers taking
potshots at cops.

16:29.814 --> 16:32.215
Tanks in the street.

16:32.550 --> 16:35.318
"Fuck the police"
coming out of every...

16:37.722 --> 16:39.256
A lot of our guys
just up and quit.

16:41.526 --> 16:43.794
The Sable Fine
Jewelers robbery,

16:44.162 --> 16:46.796
that's two and a half
million in blue diamonds.

16:47.164 --> 16:49.966
Yeah, I was the one you
talked to on the phone.

16:50.333 --> 16:53.703
Double homicide,
husband and wife proprietors.

16:53.937 --> 16:55.772
Woman was pregnant.

16:57.541 --> 17:00.877
Margaret Osterman.
I remember her name.

17:02.912 --> 17:05.113
Report doesn't list a suspect,

17:05.381 --> 17:06.682
zero people of interest.

17:06.949 --> 17:08.717
- Yeah, well...
- Nothing.

17:09.085 --> 17:11.319
Place was looted right
after the actual robberies,

17:11.587 --> 17:13.922
so no crime scene integrity.

17:16.925 --> 17:19.060
Wasn't no looters, either.

17:22.297 --> 17:24.631
Security tape was missing.

17:24.933 --> 17:27.434
Those two people were executed.

17:27.736 --> 17:28.969
They knew what they were doing.

17:29.204 --> 17:30.938
Tactical, like.

17:33.541 --> 17:35.442
Then those poor kids.

17:37.611 --> 17:39.478
Leonard and Laura.

17:41.648 --> 17:44.084
They witnessed it
or something, right?

17:47.788 --> 17:49.455
Christ.

17:51.658 --> 17:53.926
You had to show me this?

18:01.634 --> 18:04.302
They were hiding

18:04.604 --> 18:06.638
in one of the display cabinets.

18:06.973 --> 18:09.474
Had to stay like that
for a long time.

18:12.111 --> 18:14.979
Hiding with their parents
lying there like...

18:21.987 --> 18:23.687
I had quadruple
my normal caseload.

18:23.989 --> 18:26.124
Riots overwhelmed the system.

18:26.424 --> 18:27.858
Something didn't close fast,

18:28.092 --> 18:31.194
you moved on.

18:31.495 --> 18:33.864
Kids couldn't
offer up anything?

18:36.600 --> 18:38.601
They could barely talk.

18:39.703 --> 18:42.272
Girl was maybe four.

18:42.506 --> 18:44.474
Boy a little older.

18:45.976 --> 18:47.943
Men wore masks.

18:51.681 --> 18:53.548
That's about it.

18:55.819 --> 18:57.853
Ended up in the foster system.

19:02.191 --> 19:04.025
You got kids?

19:06.461 --> 19:08.529
One on the way.

19:11.133 --> 19:13.567
Oh, God.

19:13.836 --> 19:16.971
Those kids fucked me up.

19:17.339 --> 19:19.173
Coming from where they did,
going into the system.

19:21.075 --> 19:23.543
All that and the city burning
to the fucking ground.

19:30.685 --> 19:32.719
( banging )

19:32.921 --> 19:34.254
( grunting )

19:34.588 --> 19:36.789
Athena: <i>Be at the
Kali Klub in Ventura</i>

19:37.057 --> 19:38.657
next Saturday
at 6:00 PM.

19:39.026 --> 19:41.093
Say you're me.
Say you're there to see Bogdan.

19:41.494 --> 19:43.863
And you've got to dress like
you're worth $2,000 a night.

19:44.231 --> 19:46.065
You're gonna need
somebody's help with that.

19:46.233 --> 19:47.800
Ha.

19:48.235 --> 19:51.637
This bus is gonna take you up to
wherever the party is, I heard.

19:52.072 --> 19:54.873
And they're not gonna let you take
in a purse or a phone or anything.

19:55.208 --> 19:57.575
They're gonna make you
turn all that stuff in.

19:59.578 --> 20:02.080
Okay.

20:02.281 --> 20:04.316
( grunting )

20:04.616 --> 20:06.651
You're gonna be around
a lot of guys

20:06.919 --> 20:08.720
<i>that expect easy sex.</i>

20:09.055 --> 20:10.754
<i>What are you</i>
<i>gonna do about that?</i>

20:11.056 --> 20:13.790
I'll figure it out.
( huffing )

20:16.895 --> 20:18.863
If those webcam guys were bad,

20:19.097 --> 20:20.497
this is <i>way</i> worse.

20:20.732 --> 20:21.798
Thena, I'm police.

20:22.100 --> 20:23.567
I know how to
take care of myself.

20:23.902 --> 20:25.970
They're not gonna
let you take in a knife

20:26.204 --> 20:28.137
<i>or anything.</i>

20:28.538 --> 20:31.374
<i>They're gonna pat you down</i>
<i>and make you strip.</i>

20:33.643 --> 20:35.245
That's what I heard.

20:35.445 --> 20:37.747
( panting )

20:39.149 --> 20:41.684
That all I need to know?

20:41.919 --> 20:42.852
<i>( blade scraping )</i>

20:43.087 --> 20:45.153
I made that for you.

20:47.623 --> 20:50.525
<i>I was thinking about a woman</i>
<i>drowning on dry land.</i>

20:50.793 --> 20:53.262
Well, I don't really get art.

20:53.496 --> 20:55.330
<i>( blade scraping )</i>

20:55.731 --> 20:58.666
I just don't understand
why you work so hard to be alone.

21:00.103 --> 21:01.802
( panting )

21:02.137 --> 21:04.438
I find it really doesn't
take that much work.

21:04.773 --> 21:07.942
I've been here for 10
minutes and you're just

21:08.277 --> 21:10.544
playing with knives
just to keep me away.

21:10.845 --> 21:12.914
I was working out
when you knocked.

21:14.616 --> 21:16.817
( blade scraping )

21:22.256 --> 21:23.790
( panting )
Okay.

21:24.091 --> 21:26.326
Anything else about this party?

21:28.462 --> 21:30.397
Just that...

21:30.631 --> 21:32.799
whatever you plan,

21:33.134 --> 21:34.700
you get on that bus,
and it's fuck or run.

21:41.141 --> 21:44.543
Woman:
<i>It's hard, I won't lie.</i>

21:44.844 --> 21:46.045
<i>He filled this house up,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

21:46.379 --> 21:50.615
He loved you both as much
as any man I ever knew.

21:50.984 --> 21:54.118
He never wanted anything,
but it was for his family.

21:56.688 --> 21:58.656
It's ridiculous, I know.

22:04.796 --> 22:07.131
This isn't consolation.

22:08.567 --> 22:10.000
This was his, Joyce.

22:15.573 --> 22:17.574
Joyce: <i>That Blake guy's
not outside, right?</i>

22:17.741 --> 22:20.543
Right now?

22:20.711 --> 22:22.346
No.

22:22.546 --> 22:24.781
You know Blake?

22:25.083 --> 22:27.916
He turned up here
right after the funeral.

22:28.185 --> 22:30.819
Asked how I was doing.

22:31.154 --> 22:33.222
Condolences
and all that bullshit.

22:36.326 --> 22:37.526
And when he got
through the bullshit?

22:39.562 --> 22:42.798
Asked if Stan had shared
anything with me,

22:43.165 --> 22:45.467
<i>might help him figure out</i>
<i>who killed him.</i>

22:45.767 --> 22:47.602
Had Stan said
anything like that?

22:47.836 --> 22:49.670
Joyce:
<i>No.</i>

22:50.006 --> 22:52.840
I mean, he wasn't
running things for you

22:53.109 --> 22:54.709
like that Blake guy, right?

22:59.215 --> 23:02.049
That's just skillsets.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.051
I loved Stan.

23:10.558 --> 23:12.426
Mikey doesn't know what to do.

23:14.795 --> 23:18.697
Stan was a great father.

23:18.965 --> 23:22.601
Not like a lot of--
Of them.

23:22.936 --> 23:26.406
I think about my
little boy not having--

23:26.573 --> 23:29.409
( sobs )

23:33.113 --> 23:34.546
Joyce: <i>- I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Woman: - It's okay.</i>

23:42.422 --> 23:45.157
Joyce: <i>- I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Woman: - It's okay, Joyce.</i>

23:52.664 --> 23:53.630
<i>( sobbing continues )</i>

23:58.470 --> 24:00.804
Ray: <i>And this is a
stealth bomber.</i>

24:02.640 --> 24:05.142
Yeah.

24:05.410 --> 24:08.144
It can carry 80 smart bombs.

24:08.412 --> 24:10.680
Means they never miss.

24:16.120 --> 24:17.253
It's called
"The Spirit."

24:20.757 --> 24:23.025
You--

24:23.427 --> 24:25.827
Maybe you're not that interested
in this stuff anymore, huh?

24:26.028 --> 24:27.429
That's okay.

24:27.630 --> 24:29.364
It kills people.

24:34.971 --> 24:36.771
Yeah.

24:44.012 --> 24:47.081
Maybe some TV, then? You want to
watch anything? I DVR'd the Cardinals.

24:47.382 --> 24:49.317
We could watch "Friends."
It's always on.

24:49.684 --> 24:52.153
"Friends"?
That show that's like 20 years old?

24:52.488 --> 24:54.388
I had an old girlfriend
that used to watch it.

24:54.656 --> 24:56.757
<i>( pencil scratching )</i>

24:59.327 --> 25:01.828
What-all you
scribbling over there?

25:02.196 --> 25:04.731
There some high drama
happening I don't see?

25:05.032 --> 25:06.866
Please limit our interaction.

25:07.168 --> 25:09.169
I have a mandate to observe.

25:18.512 --> 25:21.380
By all means, buddy,
find "Friends."

25:24.618 --> 25:26.585
<i>( faint TV audio plays )</i>

25:32.425 --> 25:34.359
Your dad teach you that?

25:37.463 --> 25:40.231
My old man never
had time for sports.

25:44.603 --> 25:46.304
You want to sit for a second?

26:00.285 --> 26:02.852
Your father...

26:03.120 --> 26:06.623
was a good, good man.

26:09.226 --> 26:10.993
He was one of the best.

26:11.161 --> 26:13.095
I know that.

26:13.430 --> 26:16.098
Everybody doesn't need
to keep saying.

26:19.002 --> 26:21.770
Things are gonna be
hard for a while,

26:22.005 --> 26:24.272
but you'll come out.

26:24.507 --> 26:27.008
'Cause you got him in you.

26:27.243 --> 26:30.412
His fight is in you.

26:32.315 --> 26:33.948
Sometimes--

26:37.253 --> 26:41.788
Sometimes a thing happens,
splits your life.

26:42.090 --> 26:45.759
There's a before and after.

26:46.094 --> 26:49.296
I got like five
of them at this point.

26:49.531 --> 26:53.601
And this is your first.

26:55.604 --> 26:57.338
But if you
use it right--

26:57.539 --> 27:00.473
The bad thing--

27:00.708 --> 27:02.609
You use it right and...

27:05.646 --> 27:07.880
it makes you better.

27:09.015 --> 27:11.217
Stronger.

27:11.552 --> 27:13.853
It gives you something
most people don't have.

27:17.290 --> 27:20.992
Bad as this is,
wrong as it is...

27:22.395 --> 27:23.995
this hurt...

27:25.965 --> 27:28.199
it can make you a better man.

27:31.304 --> 27:33.003
That's what pain does.

27:35.039 --> 27:37.541
It shows you what
was on the inside.

27:40.011 --> 27:41.679
And inside of you...

27:43.715 --> 27:45.549
is pure gold.

27:47.018 --> 27:48.586
And I know that.

27:48.853 --> 27:51.087
Your father knew that, too.

27:52.990 --> 27:55.759
Pure, solid gold.

27:55.993 --> 27:56.926
That's what you got.

You okay with that?

I guess not.

they might--

They might tell you
things about you

41:01.165 --> 41:04.634
Sounds like you want

41:04.968 --> 41:07.237
But you told us
you don't need partners.

41:07.505 --> 41:10.972
Her name is Irina Rulfo.

41:12.675 --> 41:15.044
Amarillo used to pimp her out.

I want her to answer

42:20.372 --> 42:23.441
First year,
I don't take a percentage.

42:25.177 --> 42:26.944
You keep what you make.

42:27.113 --> 42:29.080
100%.

42:29.381 --> 42:32.049
We'll get her

50:20.991 --> 50:22.625
Fuck. Shit.

50:22.893 --> 50:24.627
I've been watching you, miss.

50:24.895 --> 50:26.362
You know, I said to myself,

50:26.630 --> 50:28.631
now there is a real woman.

50:28.899 --> 50:30.666
Not like these little girls.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.101
Oh, they try to make
like they understand,

50:33.369 --> 50:35.904
but it's just empty eyes.

50:38.808 --> 50:42.310
You see, for me, it's just
as much about the dialogue.

50:45.081 --> 50:46.582
I could talk to you all day
about the oil business,

50:46.916 --> 50:49.183
but I'm sure you'd like
to do something else.

51:34.027 --> 51:35.794
( voices murmuring )

51:40.132 --> 51:42.734
$12 million doesn't
fit in a briefcase.

51:43.068 --> 51:44.568
Jacob: <i>The exchange
will be secure.</i>

51:44.903 --> 51:46.804
We can enter the money
into the system

51:47.139 --> 51:49.540
as marketing costs,
investment overlay.

51:49.775 --> 51:51.208
Like you did with Semyon?

51:52.711 --> 51:54.245
That was between
him and Caspere.

51:55.880 --> 51:57.814
And your people's investments

51:58.116 --> 52:00.350
are worth considerably
more to us.

52:00.618 --> 52:02.753
Now, please, enjoy the evening.

52:03.121 --> 52:06.589
Full moon is the best time
to ratify alliances.

52:21.271 --> 52:23.139
( clicking )

52:32.414 --> 52:35.249
Man: A nation's strength
is determined by two things--

52:37.319 --> 52:40.488
( voice echoes )
Its energy resources...

52:40.756 --> 52:42.991
and its capacity for war.

52:47.128 --> 52:49.163
Oh, yes, here we are.

52:52.366 --> 52:54.568
You care to watch for a while?

52:54.869 --> 52:57.437
<i>I do so enjoy</i>
<i>the natural state.</i>

53:00.508 --> 53:03.443
You're the prettiest
little girl I ever seen.

53:06.847 --> 53:09.849
I heard there's a unicorn
in those woods.

53:13.787 --> 53:15.354
You want to help me
look for it?

53:15.555 --> 53:18.958
( panting )

53:19.159 --> 53:20.593
( whimpers )

53:20.827 --> 53:22.794
Why don't you partake

53:23.062 --> 53:24.529
and I'll join you momentarily?

53:24.831 --> 53:27.032
( Russian accent )
Excuse, please.

53:27.299 --> 53:31.136
I-- bathroom.
I return.

53:31.403 --> 53:34.639
You come right back here, now.

53:34.974 --> 53:37.142
Don't make me have
to find you, miss.

53:39.510 --> 53:41.445
Splash of water.

53:41.646 --> 53:43.480
Perfume.

53:43.681 --> 53:46.050
( panting )

53:57.194 --> 53:59.963
<i>( women moaning )</i>

54:35.330 --> 54:38.132
<i>( faint thunder rumbles )</i>

54:40.502 --> 54:41.769

54:44.973 --> 54:48.074
- ( bangs )
- ( gasping )

54:52.413 --> 54:54.681
( gagging, gulping )

54:59.520 --> 55:01.288
( panting )

55:31.483 --> 55:33.184
Fuck.

55:38.689 --> 55:40.457
<i>( Ray grunting )</i>

55:47.165 --> 55:49.399
Woman: Some of them taste
better than others.

55:49.567 --> 55:51.534
( panting )

55:58.575 --> 55:59.408
Vera?

56:04.681 --> 56:07.216
Vera.
Vera Machiado?

56:07.417 --> 56:09.018
Oh, my God.

56:11.153 --> 56:13.154
I'm a friend
of your sister Dani's.

56:13.422 --> 56:14.722
We got to get you out of here.

56:14.991 --> 56:16.624
Vera: - No. No...
- Come on.

56:16.859 --> 56:18.760
Come on.
Get up.

56:18.928 --> 56:21.062
Come on.

56:35.243 --> 56:37.344
Now, I know I said don't make
me have to come and find you,

56:37.578 --> 56:39.546
but--
( groans )

56:41.349 --> 56:43.284
( groans )

56:44.786 --> 56:46.752
Fucking whore.

56:50.424 --> 56:51.958
( bangs )

56:52.126 --> 56:54.360
( gasping )

57:04.737 --> 57:05.870
( coughing )

57:10.977 --> 57:13.211
Fuck you do?

57:17.984 --> 57:20.318
( panting )

57:29.995 --> 57:31.929
Oh, God. Take her.
Take her, take her.

57:32.130 --> 57:34.765
Go, go, go, go.

57:35.900 --> 57:38.134
Move.

57:38.469 --> 57:40.437
Paul: - Who is she?
- My missing person.

57:40.737 --> 57:42.572
- Take her.
- <i>( men yelling )</i>

57:42.840 --> 57:44.174
Velcoro's getting
the car. Go.

57:44.342 --> 57:46.109
Fuck.

57:46.310 --> 57:48.078
( yelling )

57:48.412 --> 57:50.580
Ani: Okay, you got to run.
You got to run.

57:50.781 --> 57:52.748
Go, go, go.

57:52.950 --> 57:54.450
Man:
Hey!

58:00.656 --> 58:02.557
<i>( engine roaring )</i>

58:02.792 --> 58:05.327
Fuck. Come on...!

58:08.131 --> 58:09.031
Paul:
Look. That's him.

58:09.265 --> 58:10.331
( tires squeal )

58:13.768 --> 58:15.636
- ( gunshots popping )
Ani: - Get down! Get down!

58:17.272 --> 58:19.874
- Go.

58:24.046 --> 58:25.813
Paul:
Kill the lights.

58:26.181 --> 58:28.648
- Who's the girl?
- Bezzerides's missing person.

58:28.849 --> 58:31.151
( gasping )

58:31.386 --> 58:33.153
Paul:
I got this stuff.

58:36.491 --> 58:38.425
Some kind of deal going down.

58:38.726 --> 58:40.327
<i>Same land area</i>
<i>as we were talking.</i>

58:40.561 --> 58:42.195
Fuck.
What happened?

58:42.530 --> 58:44.196
They gave me something.
I don't know.

58:45.832 --> 58:47.500
I think I killed someone.

58:50.837 --> 58:52.571
Oh, Jesus.

58:52.805 --> 58:54.907
Those motherfuckers.

59:05.751 --> 59:07.419
These contracts...

59:08.987 --> 59:11.022
signatures all over them.
