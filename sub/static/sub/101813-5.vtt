19:20.246 --> 19:21.551
of a wild child
in his youth?

19:21.595 --> 19:23.771
I'm just glad my
juvenile delinquency

19:23.814 --> 19:25.773
is coming in useful now.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.210
There you have it.

19:28.254 --> 19:29.777
Let's go.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.914
No, no. Hold on, hold on.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.481
Let me try something.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.279
Put the towel in.
It creates a seal.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.759
There you go.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.285
[blowing]

19:59.328 --> 20:01.156
[gas pouring]

20:02.288 --> 20:04.768
Got it!Not bad. [chuckles]

20:07.597 --> 20:10.426
Hey, can I ask you something?Shoot.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.951
I feel like there's, uh...

20:13.995 --> 20:15.649
tension between us.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.782
I get the sense
you don't like me.

20:19.783 --> 20:21.916
What're you talking about?

20:21.959 --> 20:23.657
We're out here
stealing gas in...

20:23.700 --> 20:25.049
in the middle of a hurricane.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.747
How could I not like you?

20:26.790 --> 20:28.314
Come on, man.

20:28.357 --> 20:29.967
Level with me.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.582
I don't have any issues
with you.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.410
Higgy and I,

20:37.453 --> 20:39.325
we work really closely together,

20:39.368 --> 20:40.935
and...

20:40.978 --> 20:42.415
[chuckles]

20:42.458 --> 20:44.112
Now I got to share her
with somebody else.

20:44.155 --> 20:46.288
That's...

20:46.332 --> 20:48.377
I don't know, it's new for me.

20:50.379 --> 20:53.034
I know it's kind of
selfish, but...

20:53.077 --> 20:55.645
it's the truth.

20:55.689 --> 20:58.300
And I just got to get
used to the idea

20:58.344 --> 21:01.303
that I'm gonna have to share her
with somebody.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.697
It's a little hard.
Not gonna lie.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.613
I get it.

21:06.656 --> 21:09.833
And for what it's worth,
what you guys have,

21:09.877 --> 21:12.793
as far as I'm concerned,
that came first.

21:12.836 --> 21:14.360
You're a team.

21:14.403 --> 21:17.232
A good one,
from what I hear.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.625
And I wouldn't want
to do anything

21:18.668 --> 21:20.366
to get in the way of that.

21:21.584 --> 21:23.238
Appreciate it.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.503
[knocking]EARL:
Open up!

21:27.547 --> 21:29.157
Let me in!

21:29.200 --> 21:32.116
What happened to going
down with the ship, Earl?

21:32.160 --> 21:33.901
I was drunk then. I'm sober now.

21:33.944 --> 21:36.251
Give me a drink.[knocking]

21:36.295 --> 21:38.340
Yeah. Come on, come on!

21:38.384 --> 21:40.560
[groans, laughs]

21:40.603 --> 21:41.865
It's wet.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.563
You're soaked.

21:43.606 --> 21:45.216
Valiant effort.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.348
Don't know what
you're missing, huh?

21:46.392 --> 21:47.567
[laughs]

21:47.610 --> 21:49.046
Thank you.

21:49.090 --> 21:50.657
Thomas?

21:50.700 --> 21:53.007
Thanks.

21:55.270 --> 21:57.794
[explosive thudding]

22:04.845 --> 22:06.107
You okay?Yeah.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.022
Ethan?Yeah, I'm okay.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.851
KUMU: Help!BOOKY:
We need help over here!

22:11.808 --> 22:14.985
[grunting]SHAMMY: You need leverage!
Grab a table!

22:24.255 --> 22:25.822
One, two, three!

22:25.866 --> 22:27.563
[grunting]

22:28.825 --> 22:30.261
You okay?

22:31.480 --> 22:33.308
Ah, his leg's fractured.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.876
You're gonna be all right.
Let's get him moved to the bar.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.181
Easy.

22:38.182 --> 22:40.620
[groaning]

22:40.663 --> 22:42.622
We got to pack this up.
I got some tarps in the back.

22:42.665 --> 22:45.102
I'm on it.All right. I'm gonna
get the power on.

22:58.028 --> 23:00.466
[generator humming]

23:00.509 --> 23:02.685
[Hawaiian music playing softly]

23:07.211 --> 23:09.736
What are you thinking?There's got to be
a radio on board.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.390
Might be able to use it
to call Katsumoto.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.479
HIGGINS:
If those two notice,
it'll force their hand.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.655
Yeah, which could
get ugly really quick.

23:15.698 --> 23:18.527
We have to figure out a way
to keep 'em occupied.

23:18.571 --> 23:19.659
Kumu?

23:19.702 --> 23:21.443
Yeah?

23:23.097 --> 23:24.490
We need you to distract

23:24.533 --> 23:26.361
our unwanted guests
for a little while.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.884
Do you think you can get that
poker game started up again?

23:27.928 --> 23:29.277
No problem.Hey, Kumu.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.844
Keep 'em as far away as you can.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.411
Okay.

23:35.805 --> 23:37.981
Okay. Let's move you
to a booth.

23:39.069 --> 23:41.420
Okay. Good.

23:42.725 --> 23:45.032
Now that all
the excitement's over,

23:45.075 --> 23:46.860
it's time
to get back to poker.

23:46.903 --> 23:48.296
Gonna pick up the game in here.

23:49.645 --> 23:51.125
Come on. Let's go.

23:58.132 --> 24:00.439
This is one of those rare
moments you never want to have,

24:00.482 --> 24:03.354
when having insurance
actually pays off.

24:04.355 --> 24:06.183
Yeah.

24:06.227 --> 24:08.229
Only problem is we don't.

24:08.272 --> 24:09.970
We don't what?

24:10.013 --> 24:12.276
Have insurance.

24:14.104 --> 24:16.063
What are you talking about?

24:16.106 --> 24:19.893
Look, man, when we shut down,
I-I let the premiums slide.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.808
I was gonna start
paying 'em again next month.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.418
So you're telling me that
all of this damage here--

24:23.462 --> 24:24.550
none of it's covered?

24:24.593 --> 24:27.248
Look, I-I had to make some cuts.

24:27.291 --> 24:30.251
You know? It was
a calculated risk.

24:30.294 --> 24:32.122
Well, I'd say you
miscalculated.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.995
Man, I'm sorry, all right?
I made a mistake.

24:35.038 --> 24:37.171
You think?

24:43.482 --> 24:46.789
[creaking]

24:59.323 --> 25:02.152
Mayday, Mayday.
Anyone there?

25:02.196 --> 25:03.589

25:03.632 --> 25:05.460
This is an emergency.
Anybody out there?

25:05.504 --> 25:07.506

25:08.942 --> 25:11.945
MAN:
This is Liberty,a cargo vessel
five miles south of Maui.

25:11.988 --> 25:14.164
Liberty,
this is Thomas Magnum.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.731
I'm in Ke'ehi Harbor.

25:15.775 --> 25:17.777
I need you to reach out
to Detective Katsumoto

25:17.820 --> 25:19.605
of the Honolulu
Police Department.

25:19.648 --> 25:21.476
Have him call me back
on this channel.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.913
[static]

25:23.957 --> 25:25.915
Hello? Anybody there?

25:25.959 --> 25:27.917
Whoever you are,
this channel is reserved

25:27.961 --> 25:29.179
for distress calls only.

25:29.223 --> 25:30.659
Yeah, this is a distress call!

25:30.703 --> 25:32.269
I repeat:
I need you to reach out

25:32.313 --> 25:34.489
to Detective Katsumoto of HPD.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.751
Call me back on this channel.

25:35.795 --> 25:37.840
Please. This is an emergency.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.322
Trips, aces.

25:41.365 --> 25:42.889
Yeah, baby.

25:42.932 --> 25:44.673
[chuckling]

25:44.717 --> 25:46.806
All right, I need
to hit the head.

25:46.849 --> 25:48.155
Oh, come on. One more hand?

25:48.198 --> 25:49.852
I'll be right back.

25:51.288 --> 25:55.075
[Booky laughs loudly]

26:11.700 --> 26:13.310
[static]

26:13.354 --> 26:15.617
This is Detective Katsumoto,
HPD. Anyone there?

26:15.661 --> 26:17.358
[sighs]
Thank God, Gordie.

26:17.401 --> 26:19.621
MAGNUM:
We got a problem.What's wrong?

26:19.665 --> 26:22.668
There are two guys in here
dressed as armored car guys.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.495
They hit a truck earlier,
killed the two guards,

26:24.539 --> 26:27.107
and now they're taking shelter
with us in La Mariana.

26:27.150 --> 26:28.848
How quickly can you get
some officers here?

26:28.891 --> 26:30.589
Not now.
I mean, the roads are flooded.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.852
But we'll get there
as soon as we can.

26:32.895 --> 26:34.375
Great.

26:34.418 --> 26:36.812
What are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

26:38.771 --> 26:41.251
How do you propose
we keep them here?

26:41.295 --> 26:42.470
I'm working on it.

26:42.513 --> 26:44.298
[door closes]

26:47.823 --> 26:49.912
We could sabotage
the armored car.

26:49.956 --> 26:53.524
We can't access the engine,
and the tires are run-flats.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.880
I have an idea.

27:02.359 --> 27:04.274
[engine revving]

27:20.769 --> 27:23.119
[engine starts, revs]

[car alarm blaring]

27:33.173 --> 27:34.609
Car alarm.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.045
Wind must have
set it off.

27:40.789 --> 27:42.443
Anyone gonna kill it?

27:42.486 --> 27:45.489
Uh, yeah. I think it's mine.
Left the key in the car.

27:51.582 --> 27:53.846
[car alarm blaring]

27:57.588 --> 27:59.765
You got to shut that thing off!

27:59.808 --> 28:01.331
I'm working on it!

28:03.638 --> 28:05.248
[car alarm chirps, stops]

28:11.907 --> 28:13.953
[door opens]

28:18.218 --> 28:19.785
Hey.

28:19.828 --> 28:21.090
Where'd you go?

28:22.831 --> 28:24.659
Check the dock lines.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.488
We don't want another boat
coming through the wall, do we?

28:27.531 --> 28:29.316
Yeah. We wouldn't want that.

28:29.359 --> 28:31.057
So, how's it looking out there?

28:31.100 --> 28:32.188
I think we're in good shape.

28:32.232 --> 28:34.321
Yeah? You own a boat?

28:34.364 --> 28:37.150
No. No, I served in the Navy.

28:37.193 --> 28:41.676
Well, thank you
for your service.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.460
It was an honor.

28:46.202 --> 28:47.987
Hey, sailor.

28:48.030 --> 28:49.249
[guns clicking]

28:50.293 --> 28:51.599
What were you really
doing out there?

28:53.470 --> 28:54.820
Leave it.RICK:
Hey, hey.

28:54.863 --> 28:55.864
Come on, guys.
What's going on here?

28:55.908 --> 28:57.083
Shut up!

28:57.126 --> 28:58.519
You gonna answer me, sailor?

28:58.562 --> 28:59.912
Just calm down, all right?

28:59.955 --> 29:02.001
Everybody's a little bit
on edge right now.

29:02.044 --> 29:03.393
I understand...[grunting]

Open it! Move!

29:24.414 --> 29:25.894
You stick us in there,
we're gonna die.

You'll be fine.

29:27.417 --> 29:30.377
[Ethan groaning]

29:30.420 --> 29:32.771
Can I please just grab some
supplies to treat his wound?

29:32.814 --> 29:34.207
It's very serious. Please.

29:34.250 --> 29:35.295
Make it fast.

Okay, come on. Come on.
That's it. Move.

29:44.913 --> 29:47.307
Right here. Come on.

29:48.438 --> 29:51.790
All right, everyone
just relax.

[whispering]:
Where is Booky?

29:57.273 --> 29:58.709
[whispering]:
I don't know.

30:03.932 --> 30:05.804
Let's go![panting]

30:08.328 --> 30:09.982
For the pain.

30:23.691 --> 30:25.432
I'm sorry.

30:25.475 --> 30:26.825
What are you
apologizing for?

30:26.868 --> 30:28.783
I'm not usually this dumb.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.785
Please. You're being brave.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.831
[panting]:
You're very kind.

30:32.874 --> 30:34.441
No, she's right, Doc.

30:34.484 --> 30:35.790
That took guts.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.792
[panting, groaning softly]

30:37.836 --> 30:40.621
[groaning]

30:40.664 --> 30:42.144
Why didn't they just kill us?

30:42.188 --> 30:43.885
Good?
Yeah.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.844
Well, because
they're thinking tactically.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.889
Yeah, right now, there's
no point in killing anyone.

30:47.933 --> 30:50.109
They're stuck here.
Hostages give 'em

30:50.152 --> 30:51.980
leverage if the cops come
before they can leave.

30:52.024 --> 30:55.027
The only problem is, Katsumoto
won't know what happened.

30:55.070 --> 30:57.116
No, but we might have
an ace in the hole.

30:57.159 --> 30:58.639
When I was looking
for supplies,

30:58.682 --> 31:00.075
I saw Booky. He's hiding.

31:00.119 --> 31:02.338
He must have slipped out
during the commotion.

31:02.382 --> 31:03.949
Hopefully, they don't notice
he's missing.

31:03.992 --> 31:06.125
Well, if we're lucky,
he can sneak out the back,

31:06.168 --> 31:07.953
maybe get some help.TC: In this storm?

31:07.996 --> 31:09.302
At his age?

31:09.345 --> 31:10.956
Man, that's
a suicide mission.

31:10.999 --> 31:13.480
I wish that fool
would stay where he is.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.656
[groaning loudly]Sorry.

31:15.699 --> 31:17.658
[muffled groaning]

31:17.701 --> 31:19.834
You're gonna have to
tell me what to do.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.183
The bullet's near
the femoral artery.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.272
You need to take it out.

31:23.316 --> 31:25.579
[groans]
I'll talk you through it.

31:25.622 --> 31:26.710
If I can stay conscious.

31:26.754 --> 31:29.365
Okay, drink this.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.586
Why don't you guys figure out
a way to get us out of here?

31:32.629 --> 31:33.804
Isn't there a safety feature

31:33.848 --> 31:35.154
where you can't
get trapped inside?

31:35.197 --> 31:36.764
Yeah, it's this handle,

31:36.807 --> 31:38.287
but it's got to be unlocked
on the other side.

31:38.331 --> 31:40.159
Maybe if we can
pop this off,

31:40.202 --> 31:41.812
we can get
to the locking mechanism.

31:41.856 --> 31:43.945
Yeah, we just need something
like a screwdriver,

31:43.989 --> 31:45.686
something with a flat edge.

31:45.729 --> 31:46.992
Uh...

31:47.035 --> 31:48.210
maybe, uh...

31:48.254 --> 31:50.343
Oh, here we go,
here we go.

31:50.386 --> 31:52.562
This is gonna work.

31:52.606 --> 31:53.781
[grunts]

31:54.913 --> 31:57.567
You need to...
irrigate the wound first.

31:57.611 --> 31:58.917
Uh-huh.

31:59.874 --> 32:01.223
[rapid panting]

32:01.267 --> 32:02.529
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

32:02.572 --> 32:03.530
[gasping]

32:03.573 --> 32:05.010
You'll need to use

32:05.053 --> 32:06.011
those tongs...

32:06.054 --> 32:07.534
to get the bullet out.

32:07.577 --> 32:09.014
Okay.And then you'll need

32:09.057 --> 32:10.754
to cauterize the wound.

32:12.800 --> 32:13.757
Yeah.

32:13.801 --> 32:15.759
[cell phone beeping]

32:15.803 --> 32:17.457
[wind howling]

32:17.500 --> 32:19.938
Looks like
it's getting worse.

32:21.156 --> 32:23.550
You all right, missy?

32:23.593 --> 32:24.899
I'm fine.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.335
Sadly, this isn't the first time

32:26.379 --> 32:28.294
I've been on the wrong side
of a gun.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.649
Where's your friend?

32:35.692 --> 32:37.694
The one who was playing poker
with us.

32:37.738 --> 32:39.000
What do you mean?

32:39.044 --> 32:40.741
I mean look around--
he's not here.

32:40.784 --> 32:42.743
That's because he left,

32:42.786 --> 32:44.440
right before you
pulled your guns.

32:44.484 --> 32:46.225
Said he was tired
of being cooped up,

32:46.268 --> 32:47.835
would rather take his chances
out there.

32:48.836 --> 32:50.664
Watch them.
I'm gonna have a look around.

32:52.274 --> 32:53.928
And you're gonna help.Hey!

32:53.972 --> 32:56.061
Leave her alone! [groans][gasps] Shammy.

32:56.104 --> 32:58.324
Let's go!

33:00.717 --> 33:02.241
[grunts]
Damn it!Here, come on,

33:02.284 --> 33:03.329
let me... let me
give it a shot.

33:03.372 --> 33:04.895
Be my guest.

33:08.725 --> 33:10.249
[panting]

33:10.292 --> 33:12.599
Look, man, I get why
you're upset, all right?

33:12.642 --> 33:14.993
I just, I thought we agreed
we-we'd keep paying the staff

33:15.036 --> 33:16.864
through the shutdown.What's your point?

33:16.907 --> 33:19.040
My point is, how was
I supposed to do that

33:19.084 --> 33:20.607
without cutting
some corners?

33:20.650 --> 33:22.391
Cutting corners
ain't the problem.

33:22.435 --> 33:24.567
It's making a huge decision
like dropping our insurance

33:24.611 --> 33:26.352
without so much as a heads-up.

33:26.395 --> 33:27.831
I didn't want to stress you out.

33:27.875 --> 33:29.268
What does that say
about our partnership?

33:29.311 --> 33:30.965
About our friendship?

33:31.009 --> 33:33.794
Look, man, I know this thing
was never totally risk-free--

33:33.837 --> 33:35.187
I get that--

33:35.230 --> 33:37.450
but I signed on
because I believe in you.

33:37.493 --> 33:39.278
And this place.

33:39.321 --> 33:42.020
But if you're hiding things,
that's a problem.

33:43.064 --> 33:44.892
Y-You're absolutely right.

33:44.935 --> 33:46.328
I'm sorry.

33:46.372 --> 33:48.939
A hundred percent
honesty from here on.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.376
All right.

33:52.204 --> 33:53.988
Well, we'll figure it out.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.859
We'll fix
whatever we can ourselves,

33:55.903 --> 33:58.384
then I'll borrow against Island
Hoppers to pay for the rest.

33:58.427 --> 33:59.776
That's never gonna happen.

33:59.820 --> 34:01.387
But thank you.

34:03.128 --> 34:05.173
[Ethan gasps]

34:07.349 --> 34:09.090
[grunting]

34:09.134 --> 34:12.920
Ah, yes, it's just like, uh,
the first time we met, except...

34:12.963 --> 34:14.530
now I'm taking a bullet
out of you.

34:21.885 --> 34:23.757
Okay, you ready?

34:25.367 --> 34:27.195
Bite down on this.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.457
[panting]

34:32.679 --> 34:33.897

Okay.

[gasps]

34:41.296 --> 34:43.429
[Ethan panting loudly]

34:52.916 --> 34:54.353
You did good.

34:54.396 --> 34:55.702
So did you.

34:55.745 --> 34:57.399
We did good.

35:00.750 --> 35:03.188
Man, why couldn't Booky
just stay put?

35:03.231 --> 35:05.799
He's out there in this giant
hurricane, or he's hiding.

35:05.842 --> 35:07.061
Either way, he's in danger.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.715
Well, if he's still in there

35:08.758 --> 35:10.891
and they find him,
they're not gonna hurt him.

35:10.934 --> 35:13.067
He's an old man, and
he's no threat to them.

35:13.111 --> 35:16.157
Worst case, they-they put him
with the rest of the hostages.

35:16.201 --> 35:18.420
Or maybe they'll make
an example out of him.

35:22.990 --> 35:26.298
All right, my friend,
I got Ms. Tuileta out here.

35:26.341 --> 35:28.169
If you don't come out
and join the others,

35:28.213 --> 35:30.476
I'm gonna put a bullet in her.

35:31.390 --> 35:33.740
If you come out now...

35:36.177 --> 35:38.005
...nothing's
gonna happen.

35:38.048 --> 35:39.920
But if you don't...

35:39.963 --> 35:42.096
this nice lady's blood
is on your hands.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.446
Booky, if you're still here,
don't believe him.

35:45.795 --> 35:47.841
You think I'm bluffing?

35:47.884 --> 35:50.017
I think you've already killed
two men today.

35:50.060 --> 35:51.671
Why would anyone trust you?

36:02.899 --> 36:04.031
You see? He's not here.

36:04.074 --> 36:06.512
Let's go.

36:13.475 --> 36:15.477
MAGNUM:
How's it going?

36:15.521 --> 36:17.000
Not good.

36:17.044 --> 36:18.785
A few more minutes,
he's gonna go into shock.

36:18.828 --> 36:20.178
We got to get out of here.

36:21.309 --> 36:23.442
[car horn honking repeatedly]

36:23.485 --> 36:24.965
Do you hear that?

36:25.008 --> 36:26.314
[honking continues]

36:26.358 --> 36:27.968
It's a car horn.

36:28.011 --> 36:30.275
It's got a pattern to it.It's Morse code.

36:30.318 --> 36:32.190
You think...?
It's got to be Booky.

36:34.409 --> 36:37.195
[continues honking]

36:40.589 --> 36:42.069
"Move back."

36:42.112 --> 36:43.723
Wait, wait, you don't think
he-he's gonna...?

36:43.766 --> 36:45.768
Yeah, I think he is.Move-move him back!

Great. First, the boat crashes
through the bar,

36:58.303 --> 36:59.652
and now a van.

36:59.695 --> 37:00.914
Would you rather be stuck
in here?

37:00.957 --> 37:02.132
Good point.Come on.

37:07.529 --> 37:09.052
Book, you all right?

37:09.096 --> 37:11.403
[chuckles]
Too old to drive, huh?

37:11.446 --> 37:13.187
[chuckling]

37:13.231 --> 37:14.928
Let's get Ethan in the van!

37:15.929 --> 37:17.800
I'm telling you,
that wasn't the wind.

37:17.844 --> 37:19.062
I'm gonna go check it out.

gonna be napping

for a little while.

37:57.187 --> 37:58.711
Put the gun down. It's over.

37:58.754 --> 37:59.973
Oh, yeah?

Can he pull that trigger

38:01.931 --> 38:03.368
before I pop
your friend here?

38:03.411 --> 38:05.239
Calm down, all right?

38:05.283 --> 38:07.372
Nobody else has to die today.

38:07.415 --> 38:10.070
Look, there's an
armored car full of cash.

38:10.113 --> 38:11.767
Why don't you be on your way?

38:11.811 --> 38:14.379
I'm not doing anything till you
take your gun off of me.

38:14.422 --> 38:15.815
And I'm not leaving
without my partner.

Wow, such...

to him about being brave.

a little bit foolish
