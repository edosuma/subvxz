He's a regular listener
to the program,

03:26.606 --> 03:28.267
and he texted me
a while ago, and he said,

03:28.341 --> 03:30.002
"Any chance you might
play a piece of music

03:30.076 --> 03:31.509
"which Mary Coogan used

03:31.578 --> 03:35.275

mine and Cat's.

You're safe now.
Come on.

- Martha.

20:32.331 --> 20:33.764
- Come on.
- Martha.

20:33.832 --> 20:36.767
- Come on.

20:36.835 --> 20:40.293
That's it, good girl.

20:40.372 --> 20:43.239
It's okay.

20:43.308 --> 20:44.297
- Move along now, folks.

20:44.376 --> 20:45.707
Thanks,
there's no more to be done.

- Jenny!

20:52.451 --> 20:53.418
- Come on!

20:53.485 --> 20:56.352
- It's Jenny.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.389
- You should have
left her to burn.

21:03.428 --> 21:04.793
Dia linn.

21:04.863 --> 21:05.921
Dia linn.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.226
Dia linn.

21:07.299 --> 21:09.790

another deep breath in for me.

21:09.868 --> 21:12.200
- [inhales]

21:12.271 --> 21:14.068
- Good girl.

21:14.139 --> 21:16.699
Well, her lungs are clear,
thank God.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.265
- She doesn't need
to go to the hospital?

21:18.343 --> 21:20.868
- Ah, she's fine,
just exhausted.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.073
- Ah, the social worker's going
to be a couple of hours yet.

21:23.148 --> 21:24.945
- Maybe she could sleep here.

21:25.017 --> 21:25.984
- Of course.

21:26.051 --> 21:27.882
Whatever's best for Daisy.

21:27.953 --> 21:32.481
- Let me take these off,
because they're all dirty.

21:32.557 --> 21:35.082
Here.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.593
Thank you.

21:36.662 --> 21:38.960
Keep you nice and warm.

21:39.031 --> 21:42.694
Here.

21:42.768 --> 21:43.792
Yeah.

21:43.869 --> 21:44.995
You put your feet
under there.

21:45.070 --> 21:47.129
You keep warm.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.745
What does "dia linn"
mean?

21:58.817 --> 22:02.309
- "God be with us."

22:32.751 --> 22:33.775
Do you like porridge?

22:33.852 --> 22:35.945
Here, let me cook it for you.
Come on.

[Daisy crunching food]

22:48.200 --> 22:50.464
Martha!

22:56.608 --> 22:58.041
- Morning, Mr. Conroy.

22:58.110 --> 22:59.441
I'm Margaret Lindsay from

22:59.511 --> 23:01.843
the Western Health Service's
social work department.

23:01.913 --> 23:03.039
You have Daisy Gahan?

23:03.115 --> 23:04.082
- We do.

23:04.149 --> 23:05.411
- Is everything okay?

23:05.484 --> 23:06.951
- Ah, well, now it is.

23:07.018 --> 23:09.782
Come on in.

23:14.926 --> 23:17.156
- Look, I can't find
any extended family,

23:17.229 --> 23:20.357
and there's a dire shortage
of foster carers available.

23:20.432 --> 23:22.662
She's lucky to get a bed.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.565
- Maybe she could stay here
for a couple of nights

23:24.636 --> 23:26.263
until they find
a foster family for her.

23:26.338 --> 23:28.169
- No, but, Martha,
you're exhausted.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.140
- No, no, I'm fine.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.937
You know, it's Daisy
that I'm worried about

23:32.010 --> 23:33.034
and her mental stability.

23:33.111 --> 23:34.703
- But there are procedures
to be followed.

23:34.780 --> 23:37.840
You're not qualified,
and she needs to be assessed.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.850
- Well, she clearly
has difficulties.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.545
I mean,
do you think it's--

23:41.620 --> 23:42.746
do you think it's possible

23:42.821 --> 23:44.880
she has something like autism
or something?

23:44.956 --> 23:47.254
- Maybe, she's just in shock,
you know, after what she's seen.

23:47.325 --> 23:48.292
- I'm afraid I don't know.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.827
There's been no file
on Daisy.

23:49.895 --> 23:52.125
- Yeah, but surely her school
had some idea?

23:52.197 --> 23:53.323
- She never started school.

23:53.398 --> 23:54.695
- [sighs]

23:54.766 --> 23:58.600
- Look, can you get her things,
and I'll take her now.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.661
- That's ridiculous.

24:00.739 --> 24:01.933
- Come on, Daisy, love.

24:02.007 --> 24:02.974
- I'll get her things.

24:03.041 --> 24:04.065
- Do you like ice cream?

24:04.142 --> 24:05.370
What's your favorite?
Chocolate?

24:05.444 --> 24:06.411
- [screaming]

24:06.478 --> 24:07.445
- Come on now, Daisy.

24:07.512 --> 24:08.479
Daisy, stop it now.

24:08.547 --> 24:10.037
Daisy,
you're all right.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.207
Daisy, stop it!

24:11.283 --> 24:12.375
- Please, just leave her.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.418
- [screams]

24:13.485 --> 24:15.282
- Daisy, it's Martha.

24:15.353 --> 24:16.615
Come on, Daisy.

24:16.688 --> 24:18.519
Daisy, it's Martha.
Come on.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.182
Daisy, come on.

24:20.258 --> 24:22.692
Come on.

24:22.761 --> 24:26.595
[whispering]
That's it, good girl.

24:26.665 --> 24:27.927
I mean, maybe, you know,

24:27.999 --> 24:29.626
she could stay
just for a couple of days

24:29.701 --> 24:31.464
while you get
a foster family for her?

24:31.536 --> 24:33.902
- I'll have to speak
to my team leader but, yeah,

24:33.972 --> 24:36.907
maybe for a couple of days
till she's settled,

24:36.975 --> 24:39.068
but I'll be back for her.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.135
Here's my card
if you need to contact me.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.340
- All right, thanks.

24:47.285 --> 24:48.809
- No one's going to hurt you.

24:48.887 --> 24:49.854
[door clicks shut]

24:49.921 --> 24:50.888

25:50.148 --> 25:51.547
- There was no sign of her
in the house,

25:51.616 --> 25:53.550
not even a toy.

25:53.618 --> 25:57.054
Looks like
she's been living in the shed.

25:57.122 --> 25:59.056
Has she said anything
about what happened?

25:59.124 --> 26:01.422
- She hasn't said a word.

26:01.493 --> 26:03.654
Do you think
it was an accident?

26:03.728 --> 26:05.992
- Petrol all over the place.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.396
Would have gone up
like a bomb.

26:08.466 --> 26:10.229
One of them could
have caught fire.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.997
The other one
tries to help.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.038
They catch fire too.

26:16.474 --> 26:19.409
But what really bothers me

26:19.477 --> 26:22.913
is why they built it
in a fairy ring.

26:22.981 --> 26:24.846
- It wouldn't
mean anything to them.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.851
- Yeah, but, Tomas,

26:27.919 --> 26:29.250
they could have built it
anywhere.

26:29.321 --> 26:33.018
And on Halloween night...

26:50.275 --> 26:54.143
- [screaming]

26:56.781 --> 26:58.544
- I'm going
to take her home, okay?

26:58.617 --> 27:01.586
- One of us should stay.

27:20.772 --> 27:24.469
- No, we love Daisy.

27:24.542 --> 27:30.310
Smile at Daisy
like you smile at Martha.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.179
Yeah.

27:32.250 --> 27:33.683
- Tell Martha I sorted it,
though.

27:33.752 --> 27:35.310
I bought only the best.

27:35.387 --> 27:38.379
- [squeals]
Mine, my doll, mine!

27:38.456 --> 27:39.787
- That's grand, thanks.

27:39.858 --> 27:40.825
- Give me it.

27:40.892 --> 27:41.916
Give it.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.051
Give it!

27:43.128 --> 27:44.095
It's mine.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.129
- Oh.
Daisy?

27:45.196 --> 27:46.754
Will you give the doll
back to Eva?

27:46.831 --> 27:48.992
- Eva, love,
give Daisy the doll.

27:49.067 --> 27:51.092
You promise to look after him,
don't you, Daisy?

27:51.169 --> 27:52.431

No.

I like Eddie.

Shall we call him Eddie?

28:17.862 --> 28:19.295
Okay.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.355
I think it's time for Eddie
to have a sleep now.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.526

Good night, Eddie.

like to tuck him in?

28:30.508 --> 28:32.499
His new blanket.

28:37.649 --> 28:39.583
Oh, no.

28:39.651 --> 28:41.949
No, we mustn't do that.

28:42.020 --> 28:45.615
If you look, the baby needs
to be able to breathe,

28:45.690 --> 28:48.784
so we pull the blanket back down
and tuck him in.

28:48.860 --> 28:50.987
He can breathe now.

they're going to be?

- They didn't say.

29:14.819 --> 29:17.344
- Yeah, okay,
we'll see.

Thank you for coming.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.356
- Okay.
Thank you.

34:52.422 --> 34:54.357
- Very nice to meet you.

34:54.425 --> 34:56.393
- Tomas, bye.

35:00.331 --> 35:02.424
- Thank you for coming.

[door clicks shut]

35:09.574 --> 35:12.737
- What's going on?

35:12.810 --> 35:16.906
- I've had to apply for us
to foster Daisy.

35:16.981 --> 35:18.141
- Do I have any say in this
at all?

35:18.216 --> 35:19.205
- Yes, of course.

35:19.283 --> 35:21.945
I mean,
nothing's been decided yet.

35:22.019 --> 35:23.111
You know, there's--

35:23.187 --> 35:24.882
there's still assessments
to be made.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.719
Tomas, she needs a family.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.088
- Is this about Chloe?

35:28.159 --> 35:31.595
- No, not at all, no.

35:31.662 --> 35:36.429
This is about Daisy
and what she needs.

35:36.501 --> 35:39.436
She's happy here.

35:39.504 --> 35:40.766
She makes me happy.

35:40.838 --> 35:44.740
I love her.

35:44.809 --> 35:45.776
- Hello?

35:45.843 --> 35:52.180
Everybody,
quiet please.

35:52.250 --> 35:57.449
Can everyone say hello
to Daisy Gahan.

35:57.522 --> 36:00.457
all: Hello, Daisy Gahan.

36:02.793 --> 36:05.557
Two times two is four.

36:05.630 --> 36:08.224
Two times three is six.

36:08.299 --> 36:10.699
Two times four is eight.

Look at me.

I'm a fairy.

37:15.366 --> 37:19.325
- Why lock it
with your one inside?

37:19.403 --> 37:20.370
- Evening, Sean.

37:20.438 --> 37:22.804
- No one mixes
with that crowd

37:22.873 --> 37:24.272
and comes away unmarked.

37:24.342 --> 37:26.071
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

37:26.143 --> 37:27.906
- She has Martha bewitched.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.446
There'll be no room
for your little one.

37:29.513 --> 37:30.480
- Stop it, Sean.

37:30.548 --> 37:33.483
That's enough.

37:33.551 --> 37:37.578
I don't want you
around the house, okay?

37:37.655 --> 37:42.251
- Whatever you do,
don't say no to her.

37:45.363 --> 37:48.332

38:14.859 --> 38:16.121
It's pretty,
isn't it?

38:16.193 --> 38:17.160
Daisy chose it.

38:17.228 --> 38:18.559
Do you like it?

38:18.629 --> 38:21.257
- Yeah, but this is
the baby's room, isn't it?

38:21.332 --> 38:22.856
- No, no, the baby's
going to sleep with us

38:22.933 --> 38:24.696
to start with, anyway.

38:24.769 --> 38:28.705
- Right.

38:28.773 --> 38:31.401
Hey, take it easy.

38:31.475 --> 38:32.442
Let me do it.

38:32.510 --> 38:33.841
- Thank you.
That bit up there.

No, Eva, come back.

to have a go?

39:39.210 --> 39:41.007
Oh, you dropped it.

39:41.078 --> 39:42.602

Cat!

- Oh, my God.

40:59.890 --> 41:01.858
Oh, my God!

41:03.294 --> 41:04.955
- She's a changeling.

41:07.198 --> 41:08.187
- How's Eva?

41:08.265 --> 41:09.459
- She's fine.

41:09.533 --> 41:11.467
Can we just get in the car
and go home?

41:11.535 --> 41:13.196
Daisy, get in the car.

41:13.270 --> 41:14.897
Tomas!

41:17.808 --> 41:19.207
- They're saying
she's a changeling.

41:19.276 --> 41:21.210
- Oh, come on,
it's bullshit.

41:21.278 --> 41:24.441
It's superstitious bullshit.

41:24.515 --> 41:26.574
- Eva could have
died in there.

41:26.650 --> 41:30.017
- Cat, it was my fault,
and it was an accident.

41:30.087 --> 41:31.714
- Cat?

41:35.759 --> 41:39.456
- Daisy, I asked you
to get in the car.

41:39.530 --> 41:40.997
- Did you see what happened?

41:41.065 --> 41:42.430
- No, I didn't.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.626
I left them alone
for a minute.

41:43.701 --> 41:45.635
It was an accident.

41:45.703 --> 41:47.170
- What happened, Daisy?

41:47.238 --> 41:50.833
- It was an accident.

if it's engaged or not yet.

You really, really
should get that looked at.

Oh, God, help us.

Oh, God.

the doctor in the morning.

44:21.125 --> 44:23.753
- What about Daisy?

44:25.696 --> 44:27.857
- He thinks that
she's a fairy changeling.

44:27.931 --> 44:30.024
- A fairy?

44:30.100 --> 44:33.695
- Yeah,
that she's not human.

44:33.771 --> 44:36.399
- He's completely mad.

44:50.888 --> 44:52.822
It's not just him.

44:52.890 --> 44:55.620
I've seen the way
people look at her.

44:55.693 --> 44:57.854
It's like they're afraid.

44:57.928 --> 44:59.725
- It's a small place.

44:59.797 --> 45:03.233
Things don't change.

45:03.300 --> 45:07.737
People really
believe that stuff.

45:07.805 --> 45:14.074
If they thought that Daisy
was a a fairy changeling,

45:14.144 --> 45:17.910
then Halloween
is the one night of the year

45:17.981 --> 45:24.580
when the door between
this world and the next is open,

45:24.655 --> 45:28.921
and burning the changeling
would force the fairies

45:28.992 --> 45:31.017
to bring back
their real daughter.

45:33.997 --> 45:36.465
- Then they're all crazy.

She was probably

We'll go

I'm sorry.

Martha held on to her.

51:06.396 --> 51:08.523
She wouldn't let her go.

And at first,
it was the right thing to do.

51:19.643 --> 51:23.306
You know, the counselors
encouraged us to hold her,

51:23.380 --> 51:25.678
say good-bye.

51:29.886 --> 51:31.786
But then
Martha wouldn't eat.

51:31.855 --> 51:35.313
She wouldn't talk.

51:41.498 --> 51:42.829
I had to wait

Come on then.

52:21.872 --> 52:22.839
Hold my hand.

52:22.906 --> 52:26.808
- Come on, Róisín,
good girl.

52:26.877 --> 52:30.973
- What would you like to do?

52:31.047 --> 52:33.072
Would you like
to do some painting?

52:33.150 --> 52:36.085
- Yeah.

52:36.153 --> 52:39.520
- When the bough breaks,
the cradle will fall,

52:39.589 --> 52:43.719
and down will come baby,
cradle and all.

52:43.793 --> 52:47.752
Baby is drowsing,
cozy and fair.

52:47.831 --> 52:49.799
- Marty?

52:58.708 --> 53:01.677
Marty,
where are you?

53:18.862 --> 53:19.829
- Boo!

53:19.896 --> 53:24.424
- Oh!

53:24.501 --> 53:27.095
What's this?

53:27.170 --> 53:30.003
- Just having a bit of fun,
that's all.

53:37.547 --> 53:38.707
- What the fuck...

53:38.782 --> 53:40.249
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

53:40.317 --> 53:41.284
- I'm having a laugh.

53:41.351 --> 53:42.318
- What?
A laugh, is it?

53:42.385 --> 53:43.409
- Yes.
- Is it?

53:43.486 --> 53:44.783
- Yes.
- Well, who's laughing, then?

53:44.854 --> 53:45.821
- I am.

53:45.889 --> 53:46.856
Why are you afraid of her?

53:46.923 --> 53:48.015
- I'm not afraid of her.

53:48.091 --> 53:49.888
- Do you know what changelings
really were?

53:49.960 --> 53:52.986
Listen, they were the children
that no one wanted, okay?

53:53.063 --> 53:55.361
They were the sick
and the crippled,

53:55.432 --> 53:56.694
you know,
the ones who ate too much

53:56.766 --> 53:58.563
when there wasn't
enough food to go round.

53:58.635 --> 54:00.398
Their parents didn't know
what to do with them.

54:00.470 --> 54:01.596
They wanted
to get rid of them,

54:01.671 --> 54:02.797
so they burned them
or drowned them,

54:02.872 --> 54:04.396
and they blame it
on the fucking fairies.

54:04.474 --> 54:05.441
- Yeah?

54:05.508 --> 54:07.840
Well, there's a tidy logic
in that.

54:07.911 --> 54:11.210
Tell me, Martha.

54:11.281 --> 54:12.714
Tell me, what's--

54:12.782 --> 54:14.044
What are we
going to call him?

54:14.117 --> 54:15.209
- Who?

54:15.285 --> 54:16.513
- [sighs]
Come on, our baby.

54:16.586 --> 54:17.746
- Oh,
don't change the subject.

54:17.821 --> 54:18.788
- Our baby,
our baby boy.

54:18.855 --> 54:19.981
I'm not
changing the subject.

54:20.056 --> 54:21.318
What are we
going to call him, huh?

54:21.391 --> 54:22.551
Have you even
thought about it?

54:22.626 --> 54:24.389
I mean, have you thought
of even one name?

54:24.461 --> 54:28.363
Have you?

54:28.431 --> 54:32.231
You're completely obsessed
with her.

54:39.209 --> 54:42.508
Fuck you.

54:48.351 --> 54:50.717
[door slams shut]

55:13.009 --> 55:15.477
- Hello, stranger.

55:15.545 --> 55:16.978
- Hey.

55:17.047 --> 55:18.571
- Where's Martha?

55:18.648 --> 55:19.910
- She's at home.

55:19.983 --> 55:24.545
You want a drink?

55:24.621 --> 55:27.317
- I see
you're making friends.

55:27.390 --> 55:30.223
- No one
wants to play with me.

55:30.293 --> 55:31.760
- It's your little fairy.

55:31.828 --> 55:35.161
And Sean Cryan
is terrified of her.

55:35.231 --> 55:38.860
I mean,
I don't believe a word of it.

55:38.935 --> 55:40.232
But, really,
what do you expect

55:40.303 --> 55:44.296
if you let her run around town
dressed like a fairy?

55:44.374 --> 55:46.308
Come on, Tomo.

55:46.376 --> 55:48.344
Think about it.

55:55.018 --> 55:57.612
Honestly, it's hard enough
bringing up your own kids.

55:57.687 --> 56:00.952
Brian and I never got a break,
and look where we ended up.

56:01.024 --> 56:02.855
But to take on
a child like that...

56:02.926 --> 56:06.020
- We haven't exactly
taken her on.

56:06.096 --> 56:08.121
- Does Martha know that?

56:10.433 --> 56:12.731
Do you want a lift?

56:12.802 --> 56:14.099
- Great.

56:27.884 --> 56:33.151
- You could have called
when you went away,

56:33.223 --> 56:35.020
sent a note.

56:39.062 --> 56:41.326
- You made your choice.

56:41.398 --> 56:42.490
- [laughs]

56:42.565 --> 56:45.830
Brian had a car.

56:45.902 --> 56:48.837
[laughter]

56:48.905 --> 56:51.203
- Yeah, Brian's car.

56:56.679 --> 56:59.341
- All you had to do
was say something.

57:05.054 --> 57:07.852
- [sighs]

57:19.135 --> 57:24.072
- Tomas, Tomas,
stop, stop.

57:24.140 --> 57:27.303
You're drunk,
and I'm stupid.

57:27.377 --> 57:30.346
- [sighs]

57:33.116 --> 57:36.051
- Oh, you love Martha.

57:36.119 --> 57:38.383
[sighs]

57:38.455 --> 57:41.049
You look at her
the way you used to look at me.

57:43.626 --> 57:45.594
[chuckles]

57:48.298 --> 57:50.596
You have to tell her
how you feel.

57:53.903 --> 57:55.871
- Yeah.

58:04.547 --> 58:06.879
[engine turning]

58:27.203 --> 58:29.501
[knocking at door]

58:31.407 --> 58:35.070
- Do you want
to play with us, Daisy?

58:35.144 --> 58:40.241
- Come on, Daisy,
want to play with us?

58:40.316 --> 58:42.011
- [giggles]

58:50.927 --> 58:53.862
- Come on,
let's get her.

59:01.371 --> 59:05.307
Stand still,
or I'll shoot, Daisy.

59:05.375 --> 59:06.399
Are you a fairy?

59:06.476 --> 59:08.910
- [giggles]

59:08.978 --> 59:11.071
- She's warm.

59:11.147 --> 59:12.171
- Play with me.

59:12.248 --> 59:13.681
all: No.

59:13.750 --> 59:15.650
- Play with me.

59:15.718 --> 59:17.208
Play with me.

59:17.287 --> 59:18.754
- No.

59:18.821 --> 59:20.379
- Play with me.

59:20.456 --> 59:21.582
- [screams]

59:21.658 --> 59:22.625
- Play with me.

59:22.692 --> 59:24.489
- Away with you.
Quick.

59:24.561 --> 59:27.553
Away, away!

59:27.630 --> 59:28.654
Go home now!

59:28.731 --> 59:29.698
- [mimicking]
Go home now.

59:29.766 --> 59:30.733
- Go home now.

59:30.800 --> 59:33.268
- Go home now.

59:33.336 --> 59:35.429
Go home now!

59:35.505 --> 59:37.439
Go home now!

59:37.507 --> 59:40.601
Go home now!

59:40.677 --> 59:42.804
- None of the children
turned up for school today.

59:42.879 --> 59:44.972
The parents say they
are keeping their kids at home

59:45.048 --> 59:47.175
until Daisy is removed,

59:47.250 --> 59:49.514
that she doesn't belong
in the school.

59:49.586 --> 59:50.553
I'm sorry.

59:50.620 --> 59:51.985
I've never
heard anything like it.

59:58.194 --> 59:59.183
- Hello?

59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.287
Help, please.
Help!

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:09.705
- Daisy?

01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:30.925
[door clicks shut]

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:33.554
- Why are you here?

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:34.654
Is Daisy sick?

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.961
- I came
to see how Lucy is.

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:41.167
- It's meningitis.

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:42.864
- [sighs]
Oh.

01:00:42.939 --> 01:00:49.401
- They were all together,
you know, yesterday, with Daisy.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:52.744
She turned on them.

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:55.784
Tell me why
Daisy isn't sick too.

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:58.946
- I don't know.

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:00.046
Oh, you don't believe this.

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:01.556
[alarms blaring]

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:02.716
- Oh.

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.316
What's happening?

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:06.021
Lucy?

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:11.226
- I talked
to the three of them.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:14.394
They all
said the same thing.

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:19.908
Maybe she didn't realize
they were so close to the edge.

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:22.376
You need to keep
a closer eye on Daisy.

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:28.846
- "Fierce hatred
of a fairy woman,

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:31.853
"and so bewildered and now
staggering in her flight,

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:34.446
she followed Tink
to her doom."

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:40.952
Come on,
it's bedtime now.

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.258
Night-night.

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:43.298
[kissing sound]

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:44.833
Love you.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.249
[door clicks shut]

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:03.684
What?

01:02:03.753 --> 01:02:07.348
What is it?

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:12.326
- Sergeant Riley
came to see me today.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.761
Apparently,
Daisy thought it would be fun

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:17.925
to play catch
at the cliffs

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.128
with Lucy
and a couple of other kids.

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:29.070
They all have meningitis now,
except Daisy.

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:31.739
- [scoffs]

01:02:31.814 --> 01:02:33.577
What are you saying?

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:35.082
She's infected them?

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:38.746
- No.

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:40.413
- Well,
what are you saying, then?

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:41.923
- I don't want her
in my life.

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:44.892
I don't want her
in my family.

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:51.793
I'm saying she has to go.

01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:56.495
I love you.

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:58.665
I miss you, come on.

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:01.505
Come on,
you have to put him first.

01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:04.842
There'll be no room for him
when he comes.

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:06.438
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:07.676
I don't care
what's it called--

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:11.584
fucking fairies,
autism, abuse,

01:03:11.654 --> 01:03:12.712
whatever came first.

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:14.279
She's sucking
everything out of us.

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:16.325
- Mummy!

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:21.997
- You have to choose.

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:25.427
- Daisy, sweetheart,
come on.

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:26.559
You've got
to go back to bed.

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:27.762
- Martha, my love,
come on.

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:29.270
Don't do this.
Don't do this, Martha.

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:32.307
- Get off me, Tomas.

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:02.132
- What are you doing?

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:06.972
- It was dirty.

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:08.408
- Oh, come on.
Not all this again.

01:04:08.477 --> 01:04:09.910
It's the middle of the night.

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:11.742
- I've finished now.
It's all done.

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:14.783
Come on,
let's go to bed.

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:39.900
No, no,
please, don't touch this.

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:42.767
Thank you, Daisy.

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:49.337
No.
Please, don't touch that.

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:51.073
Put it back.

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:55.041
- Tomas doesn't want us.

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:57.915
We're bad.

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:19.708
[cans clanking]

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:02.078
- Daisy!

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:05.120
[car engine rumbling]

01:07:10.726 --> 01:07:11.715
I can't find Daisy.

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:13.056
I've been looking everywhere
for her.

01:07:13.129 --> 01:07:14.153
I can't find her.

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:15.561
- I'll bring you home.
Bringing you home.

01:07:15.631 --> 01:07:17.155
- No, no, no, no, no,
we've got to find her.

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:19.758
- Come on, I'll call Riley.
We'll find her.

01:07:25.007 --> 01:07:27.976
- [humming softly]

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:42.257
La, ah, la.

01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:48.388
[giggling]

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:52.697
- Daisy!

01:07:52.768 --> 01:07:53.735
Daisy!

01:07:53.803 --> 01:07:55.464
- Daisy!

01:07:58.407 --> 01:08:01.376
- Daisy!

01:08:11.787 --> 01:08:13.755
- Daisy!

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:34.904
- [shouts]

01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:35.944
Get back.

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:38.479
Go away, go away!

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:49.457
- Away!

01:08:49.524 --> 01:08:50.492
- [screams]

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:51.526
[muffled screams]

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:53.357
- This way, come on.

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:55.055
- [yelping screams]

01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:04.835
[agonized screaming]

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:05.965
- Sean, put it down.

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:07.008
- Daisy!
- Leave it!

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:08.042
- Help me!

01:09:08.109 --> 01:09:09.077
- [yells]

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.237
- Daddy!
[screams]

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:11.404
- Grab my hand.

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:13.743
Grab my hand!
Come on!

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:14.908
- Burn her!

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.008
- Come on, grab it.
- Help me!

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:19.816
- Kill her!
Kill--

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:21.117
Burn her!

01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:22.714
- Come on, Daisy.

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:24.725
- [screams]
I can't!

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:26.124
[screams]

01:09:26.194 --> 01:09:27.162
- Kill her!

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:28.787
- You're okay.

01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:30.354
- Dia linn!

01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:33.401
[screaming]

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:41.564
- [gasping]

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:51.982
- She should sleep
till tomorrow afternoon.

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:55.990
It's not your fault,
love.

01:09:56.058 --> 01:09:58.492
- No, I know.

01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:00.825
It's this place.

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:04.059
- I don't want to tell you
what to do.

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:06.124
But she's not safe here.

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:07.794
- But he's gone.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.838
Cryan's dead.

01:10:13.742 --> 01:10:15.437
- And your baby?

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:20.005
Moving?
Regular, vigorous?

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:21.276
- Yeah.

01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:24.319
- You need to take care
of yourself, Martha.

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:27.721
Good night now.

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:30.759
- Good night, doctor.

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:41.060
[man speaking indistinctly
over radio]

01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:42.865
- I'm still
at Tomas Conroy's.

01:10:42.938 --> 01:10:44.906
I'll be back at the station
later.

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:55.209
- She's asleep.

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:12.059
- Sergeant Riley
was suggesting that Daisy

01:11:12.134 --> 01:11:16.594
needs to be somewhere
where they have experience.

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:18.697
You know,
she needs counseling.

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:21.368
She needs proper support.

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:24.537
- In a home?

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:27.047
She is not the problem.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:29.107
Everybody else
is the problem.

01:11:29.184 --> 01:11:32.085
- But you can't deny
that she has problems.

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:36.022
And what about Eva, you know,
Lucy, the kids?

01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:43.632
[liquid pouring]

01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:46.964
[cup bangs on table]

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:48.128
- Look,
nobody in this room

01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:52.640
is saying that Daisy
is a fairy changeling.

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:55.438
But I have no doubt
that she is very troubled,

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:57.240
and she might be
dangerous.

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:05.448
- What have you
seen her do?

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:07.546
Hey?

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:10.888
What's anybody
seen her do?

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:14.895
- I know that Daisy tried
to smother her little brother

01:12:14.963 --> 01:12:17.625
when he was a newborn.

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:21.329
Now, Jenny Gahan told me that,
and I believed her.

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:26.207
And after that happened,

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:30.644
Jenny never left Daisy alone
in the room with him again.

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:35.980
The day that she put him down
for his nap,

01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:40.988
she put a latch
across his door.

01:12:41.056 --> 01:12:43.991
Nobody else could have let him
out of the room.

01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:49.998
Nobody else could have taken him
to the beach.

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:53.159
It had to be Daisy.

01:12:53.235 --> 01:12:58.673
Now we need to think about
what's best for Daisy.

01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:03.178
Okay?

01:13:03.245 --> 01:13:06.180
I've contacted
the health services.

01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:10.514
They want to take her.

01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:13.521
- When?

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:15.352
When, when are they going
to come and get her?

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:17.790
- Do you think maybe
that you could take her tonight?

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.725
- No.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:13:19.795 --> 01:13:22.059
- Martha, Martha,
please.

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:23.792
- After what
she's been through tonight,

01:13:23.866 --> 01:13:26.801
she just should sleep here.

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:28.393
You come back
and get her in the morning.

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:29.562
Okay?

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:33.404
- Well,
that seems fair enough.

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:35.602
I'll be back first thing.

01:13:42.284 --> 01:13:43.911
[door clicks shut]

01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:12.008
[baby doll cries]

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.049
[taps squeaking,
water running]

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:29.290
- Everything's
going to be all right.

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:37.098
There's something
I have to do outside.

01:14:57.559 --> 01:15:00.528
[sandpaper scraping]

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:12.273

[door latches clanking]

01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:51.913
[door creaks]

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:57.784
- Go back to bed.
It's really, really late.

01:15:57.853 --> 01:16:00.447
- I want to stay with you,
Mummy.

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:04.788
Please,
let me stay with you.

01:16:09.932 --> 01:16:12.901
[water sloshing]

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:18.663
- Do you want a bath?

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:21.368
Come on.

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:31.152
There, sit down.

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:33.653
Tell me something,
Daisy.

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:36.156
What happened
to your little brother?

01:16:36.224 --> 01:16:40.058
- He drowned.

01:16:40.128 --> 01:16:43.393
- Did you
take him swimming?

01:16:43.465 --> 01:16:45.729
Did you wake him up
from his nap?

01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:50.431
Did you undo
the latch on the door?

01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:52.439
- Latch on the door.

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:53.940
- Did you?

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:56.102
- Did you?

01:16:56.178 --> 01:17:00.774
- Remember that day
with Cat and Eva at the pool?

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:05.582
- Remember that day
with Cat and Eva at the pool?

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:10.284
- Did--did you push Eva
into the water?

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:18.925
Daisy, look at me.

01:17:19.001 --> 01:17:22.596
What happened
to your mummy and daddy?

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:24.263
- Play with me.

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:25.931
- No, sweetheart, no.

01:17:26.008 --> 01:17:31.605
- Play with me.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:35.810
- [whispering]
What are you?

01:17:35.884 --> 01:17:38.978
- I'm a fairy.

01:17:39.054 --> 01:17:40.419
I'm a fairy.

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:41.922
- No, you're not.

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:44.390
No, no, don't.
No, no, please.

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:45.483
No, no, no.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.963

No, no, no.

Daisy.

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:54.997
Daisy, you're hurting me.

- ¶ When the wind blows,
the cradle will rock ¶

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:58.237
- Please, Daisy,
just let go.

01:17:58.306 --> 01:18:00.137
Daisy,
you're hurting my tummy now.

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:02.005
Daisy, please.

Ah.
