what you and Seamus need.

I'm feeling this flyer idea.

It's perfect, dude.

How else are three guys
in their late 20s
supposed to make friends?

There's no system in place.
A flyer does all the work.
It does the work for us, man.

so far because I don't--
Okay.

"What up? We're three cool guys
looking for other cool guys...

in our party mansion."

It sounds a little gay.

Yeah.
It does sound gay.
Right?

10:00.634 --> 10:03.101

Write, um, "nothing sexual."
Good. Okay.

for other cool guys who wanna
hang out in our party mansion."

"Nothing sexual."

10:09.209 --> 10:10.742
Good, good. And add,
"Fighters welcome."

10:10.744 --> 10:12.877
'Cause, you know,
we want some tough dudes
and some big dudes.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.980
I don't want a bunch
of tough guys in here
wanting to fight me.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.382
No, I didn't mean that.
But it would be good
to have extra protection.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.651
Yeah.
Extra protection and--
All right.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.820
Well, uh, put
"fitness encouraged."

10:21.822 --> 10:23.021
Beautiful.
That sounds confusing.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.823
Do you think so?
I'll put,
"Dudes in good shape."

10:24.825 --> 10:26.291
Oh, there you go!
That solves it. Nice.

in good shape.
There we go.

Okay. But we also need
a guy who's funny and fat.
We need a funny fat guy.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.430
We need a funny fat guy.
Because every crew
has a funny fat guy.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.399
Well, no.
I'm the funny fat guy.
So don't worry about that.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.334
You're not fat, dude.
Yeah.
You're also not funny.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.236

observational humor.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.905
Oh, you know what?
That would be good.
Observational humor is cool.

10:40.907 --> 10:44.342
You know what, guys?
I'm just gonna put "nothing
sexual" again just to reiterate.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.276

Be very clear with that.

that the flyer should be
in the shape of a beer mug.

Too complicated.
I don't like that.

a good sense of style.
He's about the same age.

through my fingers.

in the palm of my hand,

been perfect for you.

we changed it. I thought
you guys were changing it.

meant to be a bicep.
It was a bicep, bro.

cut it like-- 'Cause it
looks totally like a dick.

Good point.
