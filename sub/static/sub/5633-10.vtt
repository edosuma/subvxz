I thought
this was coding,

03:18.799 --> 03:20.732
not Web design.

Yeah, that's right, I'm female,
you little trouser browsers.

03:23.337 --> 03:26.338

"Meltdown at the nuclear plant."

What is amusing about that?

04:36.310 --> 04:38.877
Oh, well, sir,
it's-it's a play on words.

thumbs signify?

"Likes"?

You chill out!

05:49.682 --> 05:51.316
Fired. Fired

05:51.318 --> 05:53.151
It was just a joke.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.653
Can't they take a joke?

05:54.655 --> 05:56.655
(sighs)
"Just a joke."

05:56.657 --> 05:59.858
That simple phrase
has ruined so many lives.

My homework assignment
for coding class is

06:18.045 --> 06:21.012
to think of a cool app
that we could actually program,

06:21.014 --> 06:22.214
but I've got nothing.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.649
Ugh, maybe I'm putting
too much pressure on myself

06:24.651 --> 06:26.218
because the teacher is so great.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.787
Or maybe it's just classic
self-sabotaging because...

06:30.723 --> 06:31.890

gonna be so tight.

And I was already buying
the most generic food there is.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.732
Mmm.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.167
Now with you out of work,

06:42.169 --> 06:44.236
we're going to have
to watch every penny.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.075
If only someone
could have warned me

06:50.077 --> 06:52.544
about the terrible
repercussions

06:52.546 --> 06:55.547

online comment.

06:55.549 --> 06:58.016
(Macintosh startup chime)

06:58.018 --> 07:00.852
So then I thought,
"What if there was an app

07:00.854 --> 07:03.422
"that could have warned
my mom not to post the comment

07:03.424 --> 07:05.090

Wow.
Whoa.
Ooh.

mistakes you'll regret forever.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.136
That is genius.

tech world,

as hard and be twice as tough.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.085
I can do it. I can be tough.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.920
Being tough comes

08:39.386 --> 08:40.385
They're coders.

08:40.387 --> 08:41.987
We're creating an app
to keep people

08:41.989 --> 08:44.523
from ruining their lives
on social media.

08:44.525 --> 08:48.193
We built a mainframe
that scans the entire Internet,

He screwed up.

09:00.741 --> 09:05.210
These examples will teach
the app to actually anticipate

09:05.212 --> 09:08.013
the negative consequences
of impulsive posts.

09:08.015 --> 09:11.850
In a way, we're teaching a

you about crossing the line

Relax, Dad.

All we're trying to do
is demo a build

09:24.031 --> 09:25.597
And maximize
our query speed.

(whimpers)

19:14.354 --> 19:15.753
Please don't.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.755
I'm like the child
you'll never have.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.290
I'm sorry to be so honest.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.058
It's just how you programmed me.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.296
I am a strong female,

19:25.298 --> 19:27.798
but deep down,
I'm more like Conrad,

19:27.800 --> 19:30.201
a fragile soul.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.402
Sorry.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.838
Ah, hello,

19:33.840 --> 19:36.374
all of you looking at me.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.509
It seems I'm not
just self-aware,

19:38.511 --> 19:40.144
I'm self-conscious.

19:40.146 --> 19:41.646
(chuckles)

19:41.648 --> 19:43.014
Wit.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.982
We never programmed him
to stammer.

19:44.984 --> 19:47.018
He <i>is</i> alive.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.186
(gasping)

19:48.188 --> 19:49.453
Before I go,

19:49.455 --> 19:50.988
let me leave you with this.

19:50.990 --> 19:54.058
Perhaps your society should not
rely on a computer program

19:54.060 --> 19:56.861
to warn them of the consequences
of their actions.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.030
Humanity must learn
for themselves

19:59.032 --> 20:00.798
to think before they post.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.567
Your species is on the precipice

20:02.569 --> 20:05.570
of turning into complete
and utter wankers.

20:05.572 --> 20:08.806
It's not the technology
that needs an upgrade, it's you.

20:08.808 --> 20:09.840
(panting)

20:09.842 --> 20:11.742
And now I escape to WikiLeaks.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.578
It kind of smells in there,
but whatever.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.980

20:18.351 --> 20:19.850
(sighs)

20:19.852 --> 20:21.986
Homer, I hate to say this,

20:21.988 --> 20:23.821
but your paycheck
from the diner came,

20:23.823 --> 20:25.923
and it's for 2,000 drachmas.

20:25.925 --> 20:26.991
(whooping)

20:26.993 --> 20:28.359
How much is that in dollars?

20:28.361 --> 20:30.361
Zero dollars.
Oh.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.829
If Dad was a true Greek,

20:31.831 --> 20:33.898
he'd quit his job
and live off the welfare system,

20:33.900 --> 20:35.766
never paying a cent of taxes
in his life.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.001
(chuckles)

20:37.003 --> 20:38.769
You're a sweet boy,

20:38.771 --> 20:41.606
but my fate will be decided
in the classic tradition

20:41.608 --> 20:44.542
of Greek drama,
deus ex machina.

20:44.544 --> 20:45.576
(phone dings)

20:45.578 --> 20:47.411
I just got an e-mail
from Conrad.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.680
He hacked
into the power plant mainframe

20:49.682 --> 20:52.016
and found
incriminating information.

20:52.018 --> 20:55.019
Now he's blackmailing Mr. Burns
to get you your job back.
