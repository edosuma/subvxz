WEBVTT

01:18.246 --> 01:19.956
The hacker is on the ninth floor.

01:20.039 --> 01:22.041
Move quickly. Quietly.

01:22.125 --> 01:24.210
When we are done,
we bring the boss all ten fingers.

01:24.293 --> 01:25.294
Questions?

03:10.066 --> 03:11.275
Hungry?

04:17.842 --> 04:19.886
Mmm.

04:19.969 --> 04:22.638
Come on, that's enough.
You've eaten enough. Talk.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.015
Warm that up for you?

04:28.644 --> 04:30.271
Pie?

04:30.354 --> 04:32.065
Don't tell me you're watching your figure.

04:32.148 --> 04:33.942
-We just fought the Yakuza.
-And won!

04:34.025 --> 04:37.570
You might've mentioned the Japanese mafia
before butterfly knives started flying.

04:37.653 --> 04:40.198
-I told you I needed help, no?
-You said you needed a lawyer.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.241
-I lied.
-Yeah, no shit.

04:42.325 --> 04:43.952
You've been lying since you got here.

04:44.035 --> 04:45.703
- And that ends now.

04:45.787 --> 04:48.081
I want to know
what you're doing back here,

04:48.164 --> 04:49.999
- what's happening with the Yakuza...

04:50.083 --> 04:53.878
- And I wanna know how you know...

04:57.715 --> 04:59.342
I wanna know how you know about me.

04:59.884 --> 05:02.053
I know who you are
because I watch the news.

05:02.136 --> 05:04.138
"The successful apprehension
of Wilson Fisk."

05:04.222 --> 05:05.431
I wear a mask.

05:05.514 --> 05:09.227
Well, you can't mask that ass.
I'd know it anywhere.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.520
You've been working out, by the way.
I appreciate that.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.983
The Yakuza are a powerful organization
with powerful enemies.

05:15.066 --> 05:16.818
-Mmm-hmm.
-What do they want with you?

05:17.819 --> 05:19.737
I guess I have a way of
pissing people off sometimes.

05:19.821 --> 05:21.990
-Yeah, I agree.
-Come on.

05:22.073 --> 05:23.741
Don't be angry, Matthew.

05:23.825 --> 05:24.826
I told you.

05:24.909 --> 05:28.872
My money's planted deeply inside
investments with the Roxxon Corporation.

05:28.955 --> 05:30.414
And Roxxon has ties to crime.

05:30.498 --> 05:33.167
-How long have you known that?
-I didn't.

05:33.251 --> 05:34.710
Until last night.

05:36.087 --> 05:38.214
I stirred the pot a little
on the business side.

05:38.297 --> 05:41.134
And when I did, who came knocking
on my door but the Yakuza.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.803
Their mistake, because now,
they're after us.

05:45.596 --> 05:48.933
No. Uh-uh. There is no us.
This is your problem.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.854
Why can't you just divest your funds
from Roxxon and be done with it?

05:53.938 --> 05:55.481
That's a coward's way out.

05:57.150 --> 05:59.068
Someone screwed with me.
I don't like that.

05:59.152 --> 06:01.487
-Then get a lawyer.
-I thought I did.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.781
- Call the police.
- You're one to talk.

06:03.864 --> 06:07.076
-Devil of Hell's Kitchen--
-Would you keep your voice down?

06:09.578 --> 06:12.373
What I do is none of your business,
all right? Not anymore.

06:12.456 --> 06:13.707
Matthew--

06:14.583 --> 06:16.419
Let me tell you what's gonna happen now.

06:16.502 --> 06:17.711
You're gonna finish your food,

06:17.795 --> 06:20.006
you're gonna leave the waitress
the biggest tip she's ever seen,

06:20.089 --> 06:22.258
then you're gonna get up and leave.

06:22.341 --> 06:25.719
You're gonna book yourself on the first
available flight out of New York...

06:25.803 --> 06:27.931
and get on it,
go back to whatever spa,

06:28.014 --> 06:30.599
or resort,
or five-star hotel you just came from,

06:30.683 --> 06:32.393
and stay out of my city.

06:34.145 --> 06:37.065
If the Yakuza have their sights
set on something bigger

06:37.148 --> 06:40.859
than your spoiled little rich ass,
then I will take care of them.

06:40.944 --> 06:42.153
Let me tell you.

06:42.236 --> 06:45.614
The Yakuza do have a bigger plan,
and I'm not going anywhere.

06:45.698 --> 06:48.326
-You can't fight them.
-And you can?

06:48.409 --> 06:50.369
I drove them out of New York once before.

06:50.453 --> 06:53.456
Oh, no, you didn't.
The Yakuza never left.

06:53.539 --> 06:57.210
They just hibernated and watched you
take out all of their enemies.

06:57.293 --> 06:58.627
Now, New York is ripe for the taking,

06:58.711 --> 07:00.964
and they plan on getting
to the top of the hill first.

07:01.047 --> 07:02.590
Well, I'll scare 'em back
into hibernation--

07:02.673 --> 07:04.383
I came to you.

07:04.467 --> 07:07.011
If you don't want to be partners,
I'll handle it on my own--

07:07.095 --> 07:08.512
- Partners?
- More coffee?

07:08.596 --> 07:09.763
No.

07:12.016 --> 07:13.267
I don't need a partner.

07:13.351 --> 07:15.019
Yes, you do.

07:15.103 --> 07:16.479
And so do I.

07:16.562 --> 07:21.067
Because you have skills.
You fight better than anyone I know.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.736
But I have information.

07:23.819 --> 07:27.740
I gained access to Roxxon's servers right
in front of their little criminal faces.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.536
We do it together,
we take them down fast and hard.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.581
The second it's done,
I'm out of your city.

07:35.664 --> 07:36.749
Forever.

07:38.001 --> 07:39.585
The last time I saw you,

07:39.668 --> 07:42.505
you put a knife in my hand and asked me
to slit Roscoe Sweeney's throat.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.633
I happen to respect human life.

07:45.716 --> 07:47.969
If we do this...

07:48.052 --> 07:49.053
If...

07:50.096 --> 07:52.015
then I need to know
you're at least gonna pretend

07:52.098 --> 07:53.307
to feel the same way.

07:53.391 --> 07:55.101
Nobody dies.

07:55.184 --> 07:56.185
Do you understand?

07:57.645 --> 07:58.646
Do you understand?

07:58.729 --> 08:00.106
Oh, perfectly.

08:02.066 --> 08:03.067
Good.

08:03.151 --> 08:05.028
I have a rule of my own.

08:05.111 --> 08:06.112
Shoot.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.447
No sex.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.158
Oh, my God.

08:10.241 --> 08:12.285
You have a pair on you.

08:12.368 --> 08:13.369
Mmm?

08:13.452 --> 08:15.579
This may come as a surprise to you,

08:15.663 --> 08:18.207
but I've actually moved on
in the ten years since you left.

08:18.291 --> 08:20.876
I'm seeing someone now,
which is only part of the reason

08:20.959 --> 08:24.963
why I have zero interest in ever
starting anything up with you ever again.

08:25.048 --> 08:26.049
Of course you do.

08:26.132 --> 08:27.133
--Check, please.

08:27.216 --> 08:28.551
You're still so arrogant.

08:28.634 --> 08:29.927
Just realistic.

08:30.011 --> 08:32.138
What makes you think every man you meet
wants to sleep with you?

08:32.221 --> 08:34.682
Because so far, they have.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.687
We do this...

08:39.770 --> 08:40.771
we work together,

08:40.854 --> 08:43.024
we take down the Yakuza,
and then you're gone.

08:43.107 --> 08:44.817
I don't wanna
ever see you again.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.985
-Absolutely.
-Fine.

08:47.070 --> 08:48.779
One last thing.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.948
And this is the deal-breaker.

08:51.699 --> 08:54.660
You have to give me back that pie.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.084
So, um, Miss Page,

09:01.167 --> 09:03.919
I drew this up based on
your official statement to the police,

09:04.002 --> 09:05.338
about the Metro-General shooting.

09:06.297 --> 09:07.965
You new to New York, Mr. Roth?

09:08.716 --> 09:10.343
Born and raised.

09:10.426 --> 09:12.678
-Is this your first case?
-Second.

09:12.761 --> 09:13.929
I won my first.

09:14.597 --> 09:15.806
Domestic violence.

09:16.515 --> 09:18.351
I believe in protecting women.

09:18.434 --> 09:19.685
Thanks. From all of us.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.146
Uh, here, this says that Castle
pursued me down the stairwell,

09:22.230 --> 09:24.190
but I went down,
he went up.

09:24.273 --> 09:26.734
Um, okay, that's a change I can make.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.528
Also, I didn't escape on foot,
I had a car.

09:29.612 --> 09:32.573
-I know I told the NYPD about that.
-Um... car.

09:32.656 --> 09:35.534
I was also not Castle's only target.

09:35.618 --> 09:38.329
That's just flat out wrong.
What about Grotto? Where...

09:38.412 --> 09:39.497
Where did you get my statement?

09:39.580 --> 09:41.249
- Grotto?
- Grote.

09:41.332 --> 09:43.584
Oh, Elliot Grote.
Yeah, he's on the victim list.

09:43.667 --> 09:48.297
Ballistics matched him to one of the many
guns connected to Frank Castle.

09:48.381 --> 09:50.341
- Early start today?
- Matt.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.635
Uh, this is Christopher Roth.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.845
He's the public defender
assigned to the Castle case.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.390
I just dropped by to get Miss Page's
signature on this statement.

09:57.473 --> 09:59.308
Once we've got that,
we're all done.

09:59.392 --> 10:00.518
Well, with this meeting.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.478
With this case.

10:02.561 --> 10:03.812
How so?

10:03.896 --> 10:05.148
Castle's awake.

10:05.231 --> 10:07.191
Soon, he'll plead guilty,
then it's open and shut.

10:07.275 --> 10:08.859
Open and shut is good.

10:08.942 --> 10:12.321
New York will sleep better knowing
Frank Castle's behind bars. I know I will.

10:12.405 --> 10:14.865
Sleep even better when he's dead.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.284
Uh, dead?

10:16.367 --> 10:17.868
Well, lethal injection, probably,

10:17.951 --> 10:20.413
although the electric chair
is a possibility.

10:21.414 --> 10:22.873
New York doesn't have the death penalty.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.708
Yeah, but Delaware does.

10:25.626 --> 10:28.629
Some Dogs of Hell were murdered
out there along Interstate 95.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.424
DA Reyes just has to link
the killings to Castle,

10:31.507 --> 10:34.135
and then they'll be well within
their rights to extradite him.

10:34.218 --> 10:35.511
And...

10:35.594 --> 10:36.970
you know...

10:37.596 --> 10:39.182
Are you and DA Reyes friends?

10:40.057 --> 10:42.100
-I met her once.
-When?

10:42.185 --> 10:44.687
Yesterday, when the judge
assigned me to the case.

10:46.772 --> 10:47.815
But, look...

10:47.898 --> 10:49.358
She's the one who took down the Punisher.

10:49.442 --> 10:51.777
She's not going through all these paces

10:51.860 --> 10:54.613
so that she can
not put the final nail in his coffin.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.031
Literally.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.701
I'm sorry, Mr. Roth,
I can't sign this yet.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.118
Um...

11:01.162 --> 11:02.746
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.624
We'll be in touch, Mr. Roth.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.876
I'm sure we will.

11:15.259 --> 11:18.887
Statement he wanted me to sign?
Complete work of fiction.

11:18.971 --> 11:20.764
Probably handcrafted by Reyes.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.433
Well, we could write an anonymous letter,

11:22.516 --> 11:24.477
and maybe the judge
will assign a new public defender.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.020
Yeah, or we could help Castle ourselves.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.689
- No way.
- Yeah.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.983
We don't have to defend him.
We could just negotiate a plea deal.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.193
Without extradition,
or an electric chair.

11:33.277 --> 11:36.905
And then, Castle goes away,
Reyes gets her ticker-tape parade...

11:36.989 --> 11:38.491
everyone wins.

11:38.574 --> 11:40.033
Everyone except us.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.369
You see the front door?

11:41.452 --> 11:44.121
The "open" sign is up,
but nobody's walking in.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.456
If we keep messing with Reyes,

11:45.539 --> 11:47.040
we'll be shuttered
by the end of the month.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.166
Come on, if we stand up to her,

11:48.251 --> 11:50.043
we could actually end
her incessant bullying.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.629
And possibly save this guy's life.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.339
A murderer who shot at you.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.383
For reasons
that I don't fully understand yet.

11:55.466 --> 11:56.675
Roth said Castle's
gonna plead guilty.

11:56.759 --> 11:57.843
So we get in there,
we talk to him--

11:57.926 --> 12:00.012
Ask him some questions about
what really happened to his family,

12:00.095 --> 12:01.096
why Reyes wants him dead.

12:01.179 --> 12:04.517
Build a fair plea,
and show the DA our justice system...

12:04.600 --> 12:05.934
still has a backbone.

12:06.018 --> 12:08.771
This is a bad idea, Matt.

12:12.275 --> 12:13.609
Um...

12:13.692 --> 12:15.986
It's okay,
I'll be outside.

12:23.035 --> 12:24.620
I can't believe
we're even discussing this.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.289
He chained you to a roof.

12:26.372 --> 12:28.123
You, of all people,
should know he's a psychopath.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.626
Okay,
his methodology is clearly wrong,

12:30.709 --> 12:35.506
but... in his own kind of way,
he was trying to do something noble.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.508
- Do you hear yourself?
- Yeah.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.511
He wanted justice,
Foggy, like us.

12:41.512 --> 12:44.014
So we should risk everything...

12:44.097 --> 12:45.849
our firm, our reputation, and...

12:45.933 --> 12:48.769
and let's be honest, our safety?

12:48.852 --> 12:50.979
We should put it all on the line
to help him?

12:51.063 --> 12:52.773
Kinda. Yeah.

12:52.856 --> 12:57.361
Is this about saving a man
or saving a vigilante?

12:59.572 --> 13:00.864
He's a person.

13:02.074 --> 13:04.159
Like you, Foggy. Like me.

13:06.078 --> 13:08.539
And he shouldn't have to die.

13:18.382 --> 13:19.925
Karen, grab your stuff.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.136
We're going to the hospital.

13:28.726 --> 13:31.395
You can't have cell phones
in this area, sir!

13:31.479 --> 13:33.439
-What's going on?
-Reporters.

13:33.522 --> 13:36.609
Looks like every outlet in town
wants a word with Castle.

13:36.692 --> 13:39.069
Or a report on who does.
Come on.

13:41.113 --> 13:42.239
You press?

13:42.740 --> 13:44.324
Uh, no, attorneys.

13:44.408 --> 13:46.869
IDs?

13:51.707 --> 13:53.626
This much spotlight
concern anyone else?

13:53.709 --> 13:57.045
I mean, we're about to step onto
a big proscenium stage here.

13:57.129 --> 13:58.547
And how do I know what proscenium means?

13:58.631 --> 14:00.383
- Because I did theater in summer camp...

14:00.466 --> 14:01.675
...which is exactly the kind of thing

14:01.759 --> 14:04.302
that these reporters will find out
if they start digging into me.

14:04.387 --> 14:05.429
Come on, jazz hands.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.517
What the hell are you three doing here?

14:09.600 --> 14:10.601
Brett...

14:10.684 --> 14:13.646
You're wearing a tie, and...
it's not a clip-on.

14:13.729 --> 14:15.481
This ain't a good time, Foggy.

14:15.564 --> 14:18.359
-How'd you get babysitting duty, Sergeant?
-A detective sergeant now.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.486
- A promotion?
- Uh, just lucky.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.237
Top dogs like the press of a good collar.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.781
Yeah, and the cops that get 'em.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.157
Congratulations, Detective.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.827
I'm sorry, but the area is restricted
beyond this point. You can't be here.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.664
What if we have business
with Frank Castle?

14:31.747 --> 14:33.331
Business?
Guy's barely conscious.

14:33.416 --> 14:35.083
Our firm wants to represent him.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.502
Man's already got a lawyer.

14:36.585 --> 14:37.920
Yeah, we met that benchwarmer.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.464
Not the freshest fish
the city could've drummed up, but...

14:40.548 --> 14:42.299
he's in the running.

14:42.383 --> 14:44.217
Brett, we feel Nelson and Murdock
is better equipped

14:44.301 --> 14:46.261
to represent Mr. Castle's best interests.

14:46.344 --> 14:48.514
Certainly over that
of his current legal counsel.

14:48.597 --> 14:51.767
Look, I don't ask questions, but every
firm in the city's passed this one by.

14:51.850 --> 14:54.520
Must be a reason.
You're chasing the wrong ambulance.

14:54.603 --> 14:56.021
DA wants the death penalty.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.065
The public defender is all but ready
to roll over and help.

14:58.148 --> 15:01.359
They'll even extradite Castle
out of New York if that's what it takes.

15:01.444 --> 15:04.071
So we thought he'd respond
to our strategy of, you know,

15:04.154 --> 15:05.197
keeping him alive.

15:07.491 --> 15:08.534
Come over here.

15:12.455 --> 15:14.665
Look,
none of this is my problem.

15:14.748 --> 15:17.710
But all I know is,
you go up against this DA and lose?

15:17.793 --> 15:20.629
The only funeral to attend
will be your firm's.

15:20.713 --> 15:23.757
You're talkin' career suicide.

15:23.841 --> 15:25.718
If we walk away...

15:25.801 --> 15:27.010
we're letting him die.

15:30.222 --> 15:32.099
Bags and briefcases get searched.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.852
Do not give Castle anything.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.813
Do not take anything from him.
Arms up.

15:37.896 --> 15:40.190
They already searched us
when we came in downstairs.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.485
Yeah?
And we're gonna do it again.

15:43.819 --> 15:46.614
Everything's been removed
from inside the room.

15:46.697 --> 15:49.742
He's tied down, but keep your distance
and mind the tape.

15:49.825 --> 15:54.079
Do not step past it or I get to make
my dream come true and arrest you.

16:09.887 --> 16:10.888
Oh, my God.

16:23.901 --> 16:25.443
Matt, the tape.

16:27.488 --> 16:29.072
Frank Castle.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.743
My name is Matthew Murdock.

16:34.077 --> 16:37.581
These are my associates,
Franklin Nelson and Karen Page.

16:37.665 --> 16:38.832
Yeah.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.459
I know who you are.

16:43.796 --> 16:45.548
You protect shitbags.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.346
We came here today to make you an offer.

16:54.515 --> 16:57.142
We don't want money for our services,
we're not...

16:57.225 --> 16:59.477
interested in fame or free advertising.

16:59.562 --> 17:02.606
Weren't even assigned to your case.
We don't have to be here.

17:02.690 --> 17:06.569
But you take a quick look around,
you'll notice we're the only ones who are.

17:06.652 --> 17:08.070
As you may well know,

17:08.153 --> 17:10.989
your list of enemies extends well beyond
the gangs you've killed.

17:11.073 --> 17:14.618
You're very good
at making powerful enemies.

17:14.702 --> 17:16.620
And the day you were admitted
to Metro-General

17:16.704 --> 17:18.455
for the round you took to the head,

17:18.539 --> 17:20.749
a do-not-resuscitate order
was placed on you.

17:20.833 --> 17:24.753
And a shoot-to-kill order,
just a few days ago.

17:24.837 --> 17:26.755
We know, because we heard it given.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.799
These orders were issued
by the District Attorney.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.802
And the fact that she's had it in for us
ever since we started asking questions

17:31.885 --> 17:33.679
tells us we're on the right track.

17:33.762 --> 17:36.431
Someone in the DA's office wants
you dead, Mr. Castle...

17:36.514 --> 17:39.351
and we'd like to know why.

17:41.269 --> 17:44.815
You let us take your case,
we can soften your sentence,

17:44.898 --> 17:46.441
and give you a shot.

17:46.524 --> 17:49.527
Maybe even find out who's responsible
for what happened to you.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.783
We're talking about your life, Mr. Castle.

17:54.867 --> 17:57.995
- We can help you keep what's left of it.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.246
Yeah.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.750
Kinda like what you did for Grotto, huh?

18:04.793 --> 18:06.086
Karen. Karen! Karen!

18:06.169 --> 18:07.671
-Foggy!
-You want answers?

18:08.463 --> 18:10.758
So do we, but none of us will
get them if you're dead.

18:12.009 --> 18:13.844
Where did you get that?

18:14.887 --> 18:15.929
From your home.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.599
You were in my home?

18:19.975 --> 18:21.059
Why were you in my house?

18:21.143 --> 18:23.020
Who's in there? What?

18:23.103 --> 18:25.563
- Open the door! Open...
- You go in my house--

18:25.648 --> 18:28.776
Someone is lying about what happened
to your family, Mr. Castle.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.570
You three, out! Now!

18:41.329 --> 18:42.330
We're on shaky ground.

18:42.414 --> 18:44.041
- You need to be really careful.
- Excuse me.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.043
-How can we help you, Ms. Reyes?
-Get your things and go.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.961
Uh, we have a little bit
of business here left.

18:48.045 --> 18:49.672
Frank Castle already has counsel.

18:49.755 --> 18:52.675
So, unless you've asked
the public defender for permission

18:52.758 --> 18:54.467
to speak to his client,

18:54.551 --> 18:57.595
you are in violation
of New York legal ethics.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.932
We spoke to the PD this morning.

19:00.015 --> 19:02.559
To be honest, he doesn't seem
all that prepared to tackle this case.

19:02.643 --> 19:05.896
Although, he did mention the conversation
that you had with him yesterday.

19:09.524 --> 19:11.234
Matt Murdock, is it?

19:11.318 --> 19:13.696
- Yeah, pleasure to meet you.
- Mmm-hmm.

19:14.780 --> 19:18.784
You have a reputation of being
a smart man, Mr. Murdock.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.744
And since your colleagues seem unable

19:20.828 --> 19:23.496
to grasp the hornets' nest
they keep kicking,

19:23.580 --> 19:26.124
let me direct this at you.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.794
Leave this ward,
leave this man,

19:28.877 --> 19:32.047
leave this entire case behind
before you wake up

19:32.130 --> 19:35.759
six feet under the ash that was your
reputation and promising legal career.

19:35.843 --> 19:38.762
We have a right to a private conversation
with a prospective client.

19:38.846 --> 19:40.180
Not if there's a conflict of interest.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.683
- And what conflict is that?
- Elliot Grote.

19:42.766 --> 19:46.186
You can't represent Castle when
one of his victims was your former client.

19:46.269 --> 19:48.396
- Alleged victims.
- All the same.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.232
Representing Grotto might have
complicated matters,

19:50.315 --> 19:53.193
but then again, all evidence of our work
with him and our deal with you

19:53.276 --> 19:55.278
seems to have disappeared
from public record.

19:55.362 --> 19:59.282
It's almost as if someone didn't want it
known that you violated a witpro contract,

19:59.366 --> 20:01.534
jeopardized the safety of said witness,

20:01.618 --> 20:02.995
and then ordered
a shoot-to-kill on Castle.

20:03.078 --> 20:05.247
But I guess Ms. Reyes
could just confess to that

20:05.330 --> 20:07.791
when she files
this conflict of interest complaint.

20:07.875 --> 20:10.127
We have our case files
to back up our story.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.294
How's your side looking?

20:11.378 --> 20:12.420
The fact of the matter is,
Ms. Reyes,

20:12.504 --> 20:14.464
the only person who shouldn't
be here right now is you.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.885
Seeing as it's a breach of ethics for
the prosecuting attorney to communicate

20:17.968 --> 20:19.970
with the defendant without his assigned
legal counsel present.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.514
So, if you'll excuse us,

20:22.597 --> 20:25.017
we'd like to resume
convincing Mr. Castle that,

20:25.100 --> 20:27.936
unlike his current legal counsel,
we can actually help him.

20:28.020 --> 20:30.230
- You already did.
- What?

20:30.313 --> 20:32.900
Castle doesn't want the public defender.

20:32.983 --> 20:35.568
Says Nelson and Murdock
are his lawyers now.

20:36.361 --> 20:39.072
Thank you, Detective Sergeant.
If you'll excuse us.

20:39.156 --> 20:40.741
Foggy, do you have my cane?

20:41.742 --> 20:43.076
Thank you.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.412
Finally feel like we have the upper hand
against that woman.

20:45.495 --> 20:46.830
Yeah, she bluffs well,
but she'll negotiate.

20:46.914 --> 20:49.041
-She doesn't want this going to trial.
-Of course.

20:49.124 --> 20:51.752
She wants it to end quickly,
so she can move on to burying us--

20:51.835 --> 20:54.504
-Just deal with one problem at a time.
-So where are we supposed to start?

20:54.587 --> 20:56.548
Let's have the charges
and evidence summary brought in here.

20:56.631 --> 20:59.301
We can weed through it and work out
what terms we want directly with Frank.

20:59.384 --> 21:00.969
-It'll save time.
-Can't believe this is happening.

21:01.053 --> 21:02.345
Oh, this is happening all right.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.347
--Yeah, come in.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.102
Car service for a Mr. Murdock.

21:09.937 --> 21:11.063
Car service?

21:12.773 --> 21:15.150
Um... It's, uh, not a very good time.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.734
My employer was quite insistent.

21:16.819 --> 21:19.196
-His employer?
-Yeah, the new... the new client.

21:19.279 --> 21:22.157
Um, could you just give us a minute?

21:24.534 --> 21:25.535
Yeah, the...

21:25.618 --> 21:29.206
That new client I mentioned,
um, I forgot I scheduled a meeting.

21:29.289 --> 21:30.457
When?

21:30.540 --> 21:33.919
- I guess it's now, I suppose--
- Seriously?

21:34.002 --> 21:36.754
-After you insisted we come here?
-Foggy, you saw the bank deposit.

21:36.839 --> 21:39.174
What kind of client
sends a driver anyways--

21:39.257 --> 21:41.093
The kind that pays.

21:41.176 --> 21:42.385
A lot.

21:43.929 --> 21:45.763
I know the timing is awful, um...

21:46.807 --> 21:49.184
It's okay, just go.

21:49.267 --> 21:50.435
Go.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.815
All right.
Um, call me with any issues.

21:54.898 --> 21:56.984
This shouldn't take long, anyway.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.443
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

21:58.526 --> 21:59.862
Whoa.

21:59.945 --> 22:01.654
Okay.

22:02.322 --> 22:04.324
Is this officially happening?

22:04.407 --> 22:06.409
Are you guys dating?

22:06.493 --> 22:08.370
- Uh, we're...
- Ooh. Uh, we--

22:08.453 --> 22:09.913
Um...

22:09.997 --> 22:12.165
Not... not labeling it.

22:14.251 --> 22:17.087
You know, why don't I...
Why don't I walk you out?

22:25.095 --> 22:27.472
You think he'll be okay?
With this?

22:30.225 --> 22:33.103
Yeah, I mean,
it's a pretty small office.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.980
It's gonna take some getting used to.

22:35.063 --> 22:36.314
Yeah, I guess.

22:38.483 --> 22:41.819
But I'm not misremembering, am I?

22:41.904 --> 22:44.114
It really was the best...

22:44.197 --> 22:45.407
curry on the planet?

22:45.490 --> 22:46.783
- Mmm, yes.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.535
Great, great curry.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.329
Even better company.

22:54.499 --> 22:56.084
I'll try to make this go quick.

22:57.169 --> 22:58.170
You know what?

22:58.253 --> 23:00.047
Foggy and I have got our hands full
with everything here.

23:00.130 --> 23:02.465
Why not just make dinner
for tomorrow night?

23:02.549 --> 23:04.592
-Yeah, can we?
-Yeah.

23:04.676 --> 23:08.096
-And thanks for backing me up earlier.
-Well, I didn't do it for us.

23:08.180 --> 23:10.348
I did it 'cause helping Frank,
getting to the truth,

23:10.432 --> 23:12.684
that's the right thing to do.

23:12.767 --> 23:15.103
--What?

23:16.188 --> 23:17.605
I know.

23:19.191 --> 23:20.733
-All right.
-Okay.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.594
You can't just send a car for me
whenever you decide--

23:47.677 --> 23:50.347
-Get undressed.
-What?

23:51.764 --> 23:54.351
The invite says 7:00 p.m. sharp.

23:54.434 --> 23:55.768
No, I... I can't do this right now.

23:55.852 --> 23:57.604
-I got more important--
-We've been working so hard.

23:57.687 --> 23:58.981
I thought we'd get boozy
and let loose for a night.

23:59.064 --> 24:00.065
That's funny.

24:00.148 --> 24:03.818
We're going to a gala to steal
a top secret Roxxon ledger

24:03.901 --> 24:06.779
that details certain illegal goings-on
in Hell's Kitchen.

24:09.366 --> 24:10.950
The way in is Stan Gibson.

24:12.910 --> 24:13.953
Armed?

24:14.037 --> 24:16.831
Doubt it.
Works for Roxxon.

24:16.914 --> 24:19.959
And according to my intel,
every employee carries a key card

24:20.043 --> 24:23.921
that grants them access to their
secret floor in the Yakatomi building.

24:24.006 --> 24:28.093
What sets our friend Stan apart
is that he's just an accountant.

24:28.176 --> 24:30.012
Zero fighting chops.

24:31.596 --> 24:33.890
So you're gonna pickpocket his key card?

24:33.973 --> 24:36.351
-Yes.
-In the middle of a gala?

24:36.434 --> 24:38.311
That's the idea.

24:39.979 --> 24:44.109
After last night, the Yakuza know
they've been compromised,

24:44.192 --> 24:47.612
which means security's
gonna be tight.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.614
There was a time when you trusted me.

24:49.697 --> 24:50.782
When was that?

24:51.866 --> 24:53.160
We'll be fine.

24:54.244 --> 24:55.453
I have a life.

24:57.039 --> 24:59.916
Certain things I want to protect.
I need to know every step of this plan.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.419
Matthew, where's the fun in that?

25:02.502 --> 25:04.921
There isn't any. It's not about fun.
We have a deal.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.464
I told you, one and done.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.175
-After tonight--
-Farewell.

25:08.258 --> 25:09.342
I know.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.010
Yeah.

25:13.221 --> 25:15.098
Let's make it count, then.

25:19.227 --> 25:22.021
It's worse than I thought.

25:23.398 --> 25:25.733
Thirty-seven separate murder charges.

25:25.817 --> 25:26.984
What about you?

25:27.069 --> 25:29.612
Uh, 98 lesser...

25:29.696 --> 25:32.407
I mean,
felony assault, burglary...

25:32.490 --> 25:35.452
criminal possession of a weapon,
reckless endangerment...

25:35.535 --> 25:38.871
Any number
of criminal mischief charges.

25:38.955 --> 25:40.373
We're so screwed.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.877
You ready to go in?

25:44.961 --> 25:46.003
No.

25:47.130 --> 25:48.673
But considering the arraignment's
in a couple hours,

25:48.756 --> 25:50.007
we don't have much of a choice.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.685
Time to play twenty questions
with a killer.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.938
I've reviewed
the charges you're facing.

26:05.148 --> 26:07.150
It's my understanding that...

26:07.234 --> 26:09.569
you wish to plead guilty to all of them?

26:13.531 --> 26:15.158
I'm gonna need a...

26:15.242 --> 26:17.869
verbal confirmation
if we're gonna continue.

26:25.877 --> 26:28.421
Look, you asked us to represent you.
In order to do my job--

26:28.505 --> 26:29.589
I'm guilty.

26:31.174 --> 26:33.801
- Great, uh...
- I'm not talking to you.

26:36.179 --> 26:37.180
What?

26:39.516 --> 26:40.517
Her.

26:43.353 --> 26:45.355
I need to talk to her alone.

26:46.523 --> 26:47.940
Absolutely not.

26:49.442 --> 26:52.279
-My colleague is--
-I'll... I'll do it.

27:05.708 --> 27:08.295
- If you're feeling up to it, I--
- My family.

27:09.379 --> 27:10.463
What do you know?

27:11.506 --> 27:12.590
Uh, we can get to that.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.842
What do you know...

27:16.386 --> 27:18.095
about my family?

27:27.439 --> 27:28.648
Have you ever seen this?

27:29.732 --> 27:32.860
Police report,
complaint number 211974.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.617
"Victims were stopped at a traffic light
northbound on Buellton Ave,

27:39.701 --> 27:44.038
when an unidentified male suspect began
firing a 9mm handgun at their vehicle.

27:45.957 --> 27:48.751
Juvenile male, juvenile female,
and adult woman

27:48.835 --> 27:50.628
were found dead at the scene.

27:50.712 --> 27:53.506
Adult male driver was critically wounded
and taken to Metro-General."

27:54.299 --> 27:55.342
That's horseshit.

27:56.926 --> 27:58.886
That's the story Reyes is running with.

28:01.138 --> 28:03.850
But you and I know
you and your family, you...

28:04.976 --> 28:06.978
you were at the carousel that day.

28:08.771 --> 28:10.189
From what I can piece together,

28:10.273 --> 28:12.984
it seems like you were caught
in some kind of firefight.

28:17.364 --> 28:18.698
How much can you remember?

28:19.282 --> 28:20.450
This ain't about what I remember.

28:20.533 --> 28:21.993
Yes. Yes, it is.

28:23.703 --> 28:27.707
Mr. Castle,
I've got a lot of puzzle pieces, but...

28:27.790 --> 28:32.003
trust me, this moves a lot smoother
if you can tell me anything.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.219
It goes in and out.

28:39.302 --> 28:41.012
-Yeah.
-Okay.

28:42.222 --> 28:44.724
The fact that it fades...

28:46.976 --> 28:50.397
We took our blanket down to...
our spot.

28:50.480 --> 28:53.441
She was by the carousel on the lawn...

28:54.901 --> 28:56.694
Then I heard her shout.

28:57.904 --> 28:59.155
Scream.

29:01.824 --> 29:03.117
It was a grown man.

29:05.287 --> 29:06.663
Who did you see?

29:07.580 --> 29:08.873
I didn't.

29:10.625 --> 29:12.460
But I found out later.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.130
The Cartel.

29:16.213 --> 29:17.257
Irish.

29:18.425 --> 29:19.509
Bikers.

29:20.635 --> 29:21.886
Anyone else?

29:24.055 --> 29:25.557
I should've seen it coming.

29:27.016 --> 29:28.518
-How could you know?
-What'd I just say to you?

29:28.601 --> 29:29.811
I said that I heard it.

29:31.313 --> 29:32.439
I heard it...

29:34.274 --> 29:35.983
and I didn't do anything.

29:38.320 --> 29:40.530
My job was to keep them safe.

29:40.613 --> 29:42.782
I didn't.

29:46.869 --> 29:48.330
I didn't do it.

29:50.206 --> 29:51.916
Uh, I think...

29:51.999 --> 29:53.751
The questions can wait a minute,
I'll just...

29:53.835 --> 29:54.961
Um...

29:55.044 --> 29:56.128
Why don't I, uh...

29:57.129 --> 29:59.424
Why don't I come back when you're...

29:59.507 --> 30:00.633
You stay.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.265
Please.

30:19.276 --> 30:21.070
Wait, just hold on a second.

30:27.369 --> 30:29.245
You like my stupid tie now?

30:30.455 --> 30:32.540
-I love your stupid tie now.
-Yeah.

30:33.708 --> 30:35.543
Come on,
let's go get what we came for.

30:55.062 --> 30:57.982
- You must look nice.
- How would you know?

30:58.065 --> 31:01.486
Turned a lot of heads.
Raising a lot of heart rates.

31:04.822 --> 31:06.699
Too bad you can't enjoy the party.

31:06.783 --> 31:08.785
I think I'll manage a good time.

31:08.868 --> 31:10.412
Don't you love jazz?

31:11.328 --> 31:14.541
Eh... I'm more accustomed to '90s Top 40.

31:14.624 --> 31:17.293
Then you definitely
deserve a drink.

31:18.503 --> 31:20.463
-Elektra.
-Relax.

31:20.547 --> 31:23.591
It'll make people less self-conscious
around you.

31:23.675 --> 31:27.929
Ms. Natchios, delighted to have you
here with us this evening.

31:28.012 --> 31:31.766
You know I never pass up a chance
to have my ass kissed, Mr. Hirochi.

31:33.059 --> 31:36.604
Then, unless this fine gentleman
has beaten me to the punch,

31:36.688 --> 31:40.149
allow me to be the first kisser
this evening.

31:41.859 --> 31:43.277
You look divine, my dear.

31:44.404 --> 31:46.155
-Excuse me.
-Mmm-hmm.

31:47.407 --> 31:49.158
First kisser, huh?

31:49.241 --> 31:51.035
That's him, at the bar.

31:53.705 --> 31:55.247
Finish your drink.

31:55.331 --> 31:56.666
Why? We gonna dance?

31:56.749 --> 32:00.753
Ah, just not my song,
but Stan's thirsty.

32:00.837 --> 32:02.464
And now, so are we.

32:08.511 --> 32:11.138
Macallan still your drink?

32:11.222 --> 32:13.516
- No, it's good. Consistent.

32:13.600 --> 32:14.601
Neat.

32:14.684 --> 32:16.436
- Yes, I know.

32:22.567 --> 32:23.568
Here we go.

32:23.651 --> 32:25.903
--Wait.

32:25.987 --> 32:27.279
-Elektra.
-What?

32:27.363 --> 32:30.157
Eyes on Gibson at the bar.

32:30.241 --> 32:32.159
I guess Roxxon upped their security.

32:33.786 --> 32:34.912
They're watching him pretty close.

32:36.247 --> 32:38.040
They've pinpointed
their weak link.

32:38.124 --> 32:40.251
They're smarter than they know.

32:41.210 --> 32:44.213
And chances are,
they've got eyes everywhere else, too.

32:50.512 --> 32:53.389
Well, this is going to be
more fun than I thought.

32:55.808 --> 32:58.060
We have to get him alone somehow.

33:00.855 --> 33:02.732
Leave it to me.

33:02.815 --> 33:04.692
You just hang tight.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.417
--Oh, no!

33:21.501 --> 33:23.169
- Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
- Ugh!

33:23.252 --> 33:25.171
Shit. Oh, God.

33:25.254 --> 33:27.464
- Did I get any on you?

33:28.424 --> 33:29.634
Oh.

33:29.717 --> 33:32.011
- It's nothing.
- Please, forgive me.

33:32.094 --> 33:34.013
I insist you send me
the dry cleaning bill.

33:34.096 --> 33:36.891
No, no, I should watch
where I'm going. It's my fault.

33:36.974 --> 33:38.100
Here, allow me.

33:38.184 --> 33:40.603
Ugh, I'm such an idiot.

33:40.687 --> 33:41.729
Thank you, sir.

33:41.813 --> 33:43.272
Once again, I'm so sorry.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.481
- Think nothing of it.

33:44.566 --> 33:46.943
- Enjoy the party.
- Thank you.

33:57.537 --> 33:59.163
You were never in any danger.

34:01.290 --> 34:02.333
What?

34:02.416 --> 34:04.001
The other night.

34:05.294 --> 34:08.631
Babysitting that shit brick,
running around with that Grotto.

34:08.715 --> 34:10.466
I just...

34:10.550 --> 34:13.595
I only hurt people that deserve it.
I wanted you to know that.

34:14.596 --> 34:15.638
You think he deserved it?

34:15.722 --> 34:16.848
I do.

34:21.936 --> 34:23.730
You know he used to do hits for the Irish?

34:23.813 --> 34:25.189
Huh?

34:25.272 --> 34:28.109
One time, he shot an old lady
because she saw his face.

34:29.026 --> 34:30.319
I guess he...

34:30.402 --> 34:33.030
He didn't tell you that, huh?

34:33.114 --> 34:34.240
Yeah.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.118
The point is,
you were safe, okay?

34:37.201 --> 34:39.328
I just... wanted you to know that.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.413
Guess I'm just supposed to
take your word on that.

34:41.497 --> 34:42.498
Classy.

34:42.582 --> 34:44.584
-Nothing to do with my word, lady.
-No?

34:44.667 --> 34:45.710
No.

34:47.294 --> 34:49.130
Look, you got any idea what
a scout sniper is?

34:49.213 --> 34:50.632
- You ever heard of that? No?
- No.

34:50.715 --> 34:52.424
Okay, well, you're looking at one.

34:54.260 --> 34:57.805
My class in Quantico was class 307.

34:57.889 --> 34:59.015
And we had a... a motto.

34:59.098 --> 35:01.308
It was a saying, yeah?
It was, "One shot, one kill."

35:01.392 --> 35:03.895
The point is, if I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

35:03.978 --> 35:07.815
Why... why am I here?
Why did you ask me to stay?

35:11.903 --> 35:13.320
I don't...

35:18.034 --> 35:20.912
I guess I worry that... the memories
are just gonna go away.

35:24.165 --> 35:26.375
-Mr. Castle--
-Look, you...

35:29.086 --> 35:31.839
You went to...
You were in my house.

35:33.382 --> 35:34.884
You...

35:34.967 --> 35:36.010
You never went back?

35:37.762 --> 35:40.264
-After your family was...
-No.

35:42.099 --> 35:45.269
Can I just ask you, did you...
Were you in the kitchen?

35:46.353 --> 35:47.354
Yes.

35:49.106 --> 35:50.650
The plates, were they...

35:50.733 --> 35:54.570
Were they on the table,
or did they get into the sink?

35:54.654 --> 35:55.822
Um...

35:57.073 --> 35:58.825
Uh...

35:58.908 --> 36:00.326
I think, washed.

36:00.409 --> 36:01.744
In the rack.

36:03.162 --> 36:05.081
How about in the next room,
did you...

36:05.164 --> 36:07.083
Did you see that piano that was there?

36:07.166 --> 36:09.043
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

36:10.837 --> 36:12.922
My son, Frank Junior, he...

36:13.005 --> 36:16.467
He used to grab a handful of cookies
and take 'em and hide 'em in that bench.

36:16.550 --> 36:18.803
You know, he'd play soldier.

36:18.886 --> 36:20.387
-Guard it, protect it.
-Oh, yeah?

36:20.471 --> 36:21.806
Then he'd fall asleep down there.

36:21.889 --> 36:23.349
--We'd find him...

36:23.432 --> 36:26.435
He'd be sleeping on a pile of...
pile of cookie crumbs.

36:26.518 --> 36:27.979
Yeah, I, um...

36:29.480 --> 36:31.816
When I was little girl,
I did the same thing.

36:33.109 --> 36:36.528
Except ginger snaps and,
um, broom closet.

36:36.612 --> 36:37.989
- Oh, yeah?

36:38.072 --> 36:39.866
Pretend it was a spaceship.

36:39.949 --> 36:42.243
Take me... far away.

36:42.326 --> 36:44.787
Did you? Yeah.

36:45.955 --> 36:50.209
I guess we need that, right?
We need to get away sometimes.

36:53.796 --> 36:55.923
I went up into the kids' bedrooms.

36:57.466 --> 37:02.138
There were drawings on the walls and, uh,
sports trophies on the dressers.

37:04.473 --> 37:06.558
Yeah, I was gone a lot, so I didn't...

37:06.642 --> 37:08.352
I missed a lot of that.

37:08.435 --> 37:09.812
There were toys...

37:09.896 --> 37:12.314
scattered all over the ground, um...

37:13.524 --> 37:14.984
A lot of plastic dinosaurs.

37:15.067 --> 37:18.070
Yeah, those were my little girl's.
Those were Lisa's.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.573
When she was little,

37:21.657 --> 37:24.243
she used to make these little noises
when she played with them.

37:27.246 --> 37:29.832
What about the little...
the little car?

37:29.916 --> 37:31.000
Like a...

37:31.083 --> 37:33.419
Like a remote-controlled Jeep.

37:33.502 --> 37:36.547
Yeah, yeah, that, uh...
That was Frank Junior's.

37:36.630 --> 37:38.590
I got that for him for his
seventh birthday.

37:38.674 --> 37:39.926
He used to...

37:40.009 --> 37:42.887
- Yeah, he drove me crazy with that thing.

37:47.391 --> 37:48.642
Look, Frank, it's...

37:48.725 --> 37:51.062
It's really not for me to say...

37:52.855 --> 37:54.857
but they clearly loved you.

37:56.150 --> 37:57.318
Very much.

37:59.028 --> 38:00.988
Yeah...

38:01.072 --> 38:02.573
Okay...

38:12.917 --> 38:14.001
Here.

38:20.632 --> 38:21.801
Thank you.

38:27.098 --> 38:29.100
Thank you, ma'am.

38:29.183 --> 38:31.393
For what?

38:32.061 --> 38:34.730
You helped...
You helped me remember.

38:36.773 --> 38:37.859
You're welcome.

38:40.987 --> 38:43.405
If you wanna ask your questions,
you can go ahead.

39:01.798 --> 39:03.425
Blind bastard.

39:04.635 --> 39:07.638
Ugh, could one of you grab me a club soda?

39:07.721 --> 39:09.390
Come on.

39:09.473 --> 39:11.725
Oh, for Christ's sake.

39:11.808 --> 39:14.854
What the hell? Did the power go out,
or did you hit the switch?

40:14.997 --> 40:17.458
This will erase the recordings
and loop the security cameras.

40:26.550 --> 40:28.010
- This way.
- One second.

40:30.304 --> 40:31.388
Floor's crawling with security.

40:31.472 --> 40:33.015
Come with me.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.496
It's your lucky day,
Mr. Castle.

40:55.579 --> 40:58.665
The six Dogs of Hell gang members
you wiped out in Delaware?

40:58.749 --> 40:59.875
Won't be an issue anymore.

41:00.459 --> 41:03.337
Delaware doesn't have the evidence
to charge and extradite, so...

41:03.420 --> 41:06.465
the death penalty
is officially off the table.

41:06.548 --> 41:11.553
But Reyes also wanted three life sentences
without the possibility of parole.

41:12.596 --> 41:15.141
But as the Nelson in Nelson and Murdock,
I got her down to one,

41:15.224 --> 41:18.935
with the possibility of parole
in 25 years.

41:19.020 --> 41:20.687
That's the good news.

41:21.313 --> 41:22.606
And the bad?

41:23.524 --> 41:27.361
She wouldn't budge on protective custody.
He's gonna have to be in general pop.

41:27.444 --> 41:29.530
Uh, no, that's bullshit.
All right? He'll be...

41:29.613 --> 41:32.324
He'll be surrounded by criminals,
people out for his blood.

41:32.408 --> 41:33.784
Sounds like a party.

41:33.867 --> 41:35.494
No doubt you can handle yourself,

41:35.577 --> 41:36.996
but I think Reyes
is betting on the gangs here.

41:37.871 --> 41:39.415
Legally, though?

41:39.498 --> 41:42.293
I think this is the best possible deal
we're gonna make right now.

41:42.376 --> 41:43.377
So...

41:44.211 --> 41:45.837
I recommend you take it.

41:47.256 --> 41:48.257
Okay.

41:49.425 --> 41:52.761
Okay, so,
when the judge and Reyes come in...

41:52.844 --> 41:55.806
all you have to do
is say three simple words.

41:56.807 --> 41:57.891
"Guilty, Your Honor."

41:59.226 --> 42:01.395
And you'll never have to see us again.

42:04.315 --> 42:05.399
Can do.

42:08.610 --> 42:12.156
Case number 4854,
The People v. Frank Castle.

42:12.239 --> 42:13.824
Do you waive the reading of the charges?

42:13.907 --> 42:14.950
Yes, Your Honor.

42:15.034 --> 42:16.785
All right, then.

42:16.868 --> 42:19.038
How does the defendant plead?

42:32.593 --> 42:33.719
I plead not guilty.

42:35.429 --> 42:36.430
You hear that, witch?

42:36.513 --> 42:38.140
I'm gonna watch you burn
right along with me.

42:38.224 --> 42:39.766
-You hear me?
-Counselor, please control your client.

42:39.850 --> 42:41.935
- Do you hear me?
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

42:42.018 --> 42:44.188
The defendant has entered
a plea of not guilty.

42:44.271 --> 42:46.940
Due to the nature and severity
of the crimes he is accused of,

42:47.023 --> 42:48.442
bail is denied.

42:48.525 --> 42:51.987
A court date will be set upon consultation
with the DA's office.

42:52.071 --> 42:53.447
We are adjourned.

42:57.159 --> 42:59.495
Holy shit.

42:59.578 --> 43:01.913
That was not supposed to happen.

43:01.997 --> 43:04.416
-What'd you say to him?
-What?

43:04.500 --> 43:05.959
Three hours ago,
he was pleading guilty.

43:06.042 --> 43:08.087
-Why did he change his mind?
-Maybe he just wants the truth.

43:08.170 --> 43:09.921
About Grotto, about his family,
about the...

43:10.005 --> 43:12.007
--...the cover-up.

43:12.091 --> 43:14.718
I mean, if we go to trial,
then it all comes out, right?

43:14.801 --> 43:18.555
There's no "if."
This is happening.

43:18.639 --> 43:20.266
Trial of the century.

43:20.349 --> 43:23.018
We need to find Matt
before this goes wide.

43:23.102 --> 43:24.936
Tell him everything's about to change.

43:29.150 --> 43:30.317
Elektra. Elektra.

44:17.989 --> 44:19.700
Not bad, Magoo.

44:29.918 --> 44:31.212
Eyes on Gibson?

44:31.295 --> 44:33.004
He's in the men's room, sir.

44:44.891 --> 44:46.101
It's there.

45:22.846 --> 45:24.640
It's not there.

45:24.723 --> 45:26.433
It was supposed to be there.

45:38.904 --> 45:40.238
I take it it's not here.

45:40.322 --> 45:42.240
It was supposed to be there.

45:44.951 --> 45:47.746
--If they find Gibson, we're toast.

45:47.829 --> 45:50.165
- We have to go.

45:50.248 --> 45:52.167
-Matthew!
-Shh.

46:04.012 --> 46:06.765
Stop the elevators.
We have an intruder on the 13th floor.

46:06.848 --> 46:10.226
Pull up security footage.
I want to know who got to them.

46:15.816 --> 46:18.777
Quick! Pull up
the cameras on the 13th floor.

46:22.197 --> 46:23.198
What?

46:23.281 --> 46:25.534
--There's something behind this wall.

46:29.746 --> 46:31.832
There's an electrical current
running through it.

46:32.874 --> 46:34.000
Yeah?

46:35.669 --> 46:36.878
Where?

46:38.213 --> 46:40.591
An interruption in the signal...

46:41.550 --> 46:42.884
here.

46:42.968 --> 46:44.511
Okay.

46:44.595 --> 46:45.596
Okay...

46:53.520 --> 46:54.730
- Ah.

46:58.316 --> 46:59.610
I'm a genius.

47:08.369 --> 47:09.495
- Here, this one.

47:09.578 --> 47:10.746
Books, paper.

47:21.089 --> 47:23.049
Hiro, get in here.

47:23.967 --> 47:25.176
They're on a loop.

47:32.308 --> 47:34.185
Sir, we found the problem.

47:34.936 --> 47:37.648
All security, report to the 13th floor.

47:41.985 --> 47:43.278
This is it.

47:44.237 --> 47:45.906
The Roxxon ledger.

47:47.449 --> 47:48.617
Not now, we gotta go.

47:58.126 --> 48:00.211
I don't speak Japanese,
but I think they know we're here.

48:00.295 --> 48:02.798
- It's not working.

48:02.881 --> 48:04.090
They're gonna see us.

48:04.174 --> 48:06.176
Shut the power.
Close the gates.

48:10.639 --> 48:12.766
- Shit, they found us.
- Let's go.

48:12.849 --> 48:14.643
They've shut down the floor.
They're coming.

48:31.201 --> 48:32.786
Now.

49:43.481 --> 49:45.441
- Don't move!
- Oh! Oh, my goodness!

49:45.526 --> 49:46.943
We got something.
11th floor.

49:47.027 --> 49:49.362
We are so sorry.

49:49.445 --> 49:51.281
This is, uh, very embarrassing.

49:51.364 --> 49:54.701
We just... thought we could,
uh, sneak in here.

49:54.785 --> 49:57.037
But we'll be right out of here...

49:57.120 --> 49:58.329
Sir...

49:58.413 --> 50:00.874
He'll make a big donation.
He's very rich.

50:00.957 --> 50:02.083
Oh...

50:02.167 --> 50:04.085
-Please, sweetheart, just...
-Ow.

50:05.837 --> 50:07.047
-Very sorry, sir.
-Shut up!

50:21.687 --> 50:24.856
Nothing but a couple drunks.
Keep checking the 13th floor.

50:25.523 --> 50:26.650
Thank you.

50:26.733 --> 50:28.026
-You need to leave.
-Yes, certainly.

50:28.109 --> 50:29.736
Once again,
we're so sorry, we didn't--

50:29.820 --> 50:31.738
- Now!

50:42.999 --> 50:45.836
- Would you keep your shit together?
- Calm down.

50:51.633 --> 50:54.094
Invoices for arms.

50:54.177 --> 50:57.180
-Guns, ammunition...
-You read Japanese?

50:57.263 --> 50:58.640
Mmm-hmm.

50:58.724 --> 51:02.060
Drugs. Designer stuff, mostly.

51:02.143 --> 51:03.561
And this looks like people.

51:04.605 --> 51:06.064
Laborers of some sort.

51:07.148 --> 51:08.650
Sounds like a lot of them.

51:08.734 --> 51:10.694
Over the past several months.

51:10.777 --> 51:12.195
And all from Japan.

51:15.866 --> 51:19.285
- Oh, what is this?
- What is it?

51:19.369 --> 51:22.247
I don't know.
This one, I can't read.

51:22.330 --> 51:25.166
- What do you mean?
- It's in some kind of code.

51:25.250 --> 51:26.459
This doesn't make sense.

51:26.542 --> 51:29.921
If invoices for drugs and guns
and human trafficking aren't encrypted,

51:30.005 --> 51:31.464
then what is?

51:33.424 --> 51:35.468
Wow, what are they hiding?

51:46.521 --> 51:48.649
Same time tomorrow, Matthew?

52:01.870 --> 52:04.580
We have spent
hundreds of millions of dollars,

52:04.665 --> 52:07.458
and decades of planning on this operation.

52:07.542 --> 52:09.377
And now...

52:09.460 --> 52:12.839
our most valuable secrets
have been stolen.

52:12.923 --> 52:14.716
I'd be very disappointed

52:14.800 --> 52:18.344
to learn you aided this theft in any way,
Gibson-san.

52:18.428 --> 52:19.763
I...

52:19.846 --> 52:22.140
I had nothing to do with it.

52:22.223 --> 52:24.685
We entrusted you with access.

52:24.768 --> 52:31.274
Even employed security to protect you
and ensure the sanctity of our operation.

52:31.357 --> 52:33.026
I was in the bathroom.

52:33.109 --> 52:34.945
We were attacked.

52:40.033 --> 52:42.243
Listen!
Listen, I would never betray you!

52:42.327 --> 52:44.746
I have nothing but respect for the Yakuza!

52:45.997 --> 52:48.374
Who said I was Yakuza?

53:02.430 --> 53:04.099
- Foggy?

53:04.182 --> 53:05.892
You weren't answering your phone.

53:12.858 --> 53:14.901
-Why are you fancy?
-What's going on?

53:16.737 --> 53:18.321
The arraignment.

53:21.616 --> 53:23.827
Frank pled not guilty, Matt.

53:23.910 --> 53:25.787
-What?
-And it gets worse.

53:25.871 --> 53:29.750
Reyes pulled every string she has
and fast-tracked the trial.

53:30.333 --> 53:31.417
What...

53:33.754 --> 53:34.796
All right.

53:34.880 --> 53:36.882
All right, all right, so we, uh...
we motion to extend.

53:36.965 --> 53:38.133
We, um...

53:38.216 --> 53:41.302
maybe streamline our case theory,
and not waste time fighting any charges--

53:41.386 --> 53:43.429
You don't understand, Matt!

53:44.514 --> 53:45.556
Frank agreed!

53:46.474 --> 53:48.977
He thinks he's stickin' it to Reyes
or something.

53:50.896 --> 53:53.731
I hope your schedule is clear, buddy.

53:53.815 --> 53:56.067
'Cause The People v. Frank Castle...

53:57.152 --> 53:58.820
starts next week.
