07:18.146 --> 07:19.898
here is arguing

07:19.940 --> 07:22.192
that since the show

07:19.940 --> 07:22.192
is changing its image

07:22.234 --> 07:25.653
other changes

07:22.234 --> 07:25.653
might be long overdue.

07:25.695 --> 07:29.449
I-I thought we discussed all the

07:25.695 --> 07:29.449
changes that needed changing.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.785
If you're making changes

07:29.490 --> 07:31.785
just for the sake of changes

07:31.826 --> 07:35.496
well, that changes

07:31.826 --> 07:35.496
everything, doesn't it?

07:35.538 --> 07:38.125
Danny, I just thought the show

07:35.538 --> 07:38.125
would be a little more balanced

07:38.166 --> 07:41.628
if, let's say, well,

07:38.166 --> 07:41.628
I talked a little more

07:41.669 --> 07:44.547
and you talked

07:41.669 --> 07:44.547
a little less.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.967
Well, maybe I do

07:44.589 --> 07:46.967
go on a bit

07:47.008 --> 07:48.551
but you always

07:47.008 --> 07:48.551
seem to enjoy it.

07:48.593 --> 07:49.677
You're always sitting there

07:49.719 --> 07:51.805
you know, happy

07:49.719 --> 07:51.805
and, huh, perky.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.766
You got a problem

07:52.931 --> 07:54.766
with perky?

07:54.808 --> 07:57.018
Perky's great.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.018
Maybe it's a coffee thing.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.437
'Maybe you've been drinking

07:57.060 --> 07:58.437
a lot of coffee.'

07:58.478 --> 08:00.105
Maybe we could do this

07:58.478 --> 08:00.105
with puppets.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.982
Yeah, I think

08:00.147 --> 08:01.982
little hand puppets.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.992
Thank you.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.410
Thank you.

08:13.452 --> 08:15.162
Hey, Bitterman,

08:13.452 --> 08:15.162
you got your article?

08:15.203 --> 08:17.289
Some article, I mean,

08:15.203 --> 08:17.289
all I do is copy

08:17.331 --> 08:19.874
the menu from

08:17.331 --> 08:19.874
the school cafeteria.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.626
Come on, you write

08:19.916 --> 08:21.626
the most popular column

08:21.668 --> 08:24.296
in the whole paper,

08:21.668 --> 08:24.296
"Today's Lunch."

not your best friend,

08:25.964 --> 08:29.550
Kimmy Gibbler.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.761
Deej, you're

08:29.592 --> 08:31.761
gonna go nuts.

08:31.803 --> 08:34.306
I got an exclusive interview

08:31.803 --> 08:34.306
with Robbie Hawkins

08:34.348 --> 08:35.849
the star of

08:34.348 --> 08:35.849
the basketball team.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.935
Robbie Hawkins isn't even

08:35.890 --> 08:38.935
on the basketball team.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.480
He's the equipment manager.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.440
Yeah, but he looks

08:41.521 --> 08:43.440
so cute passing out

08:43.482 --> 08:46.485
these little cups

08:43.482 --> 08:46.485
of Gatorade.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.028
See what I mean?

08:48.069 --> 08:51.823
Well, I'm sure it's a very

08:48.069 --> 08:51.823
well written article.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.908
Written on a napkin.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.370
Read it out loud.

08:56.411 --> 08:57.871
This ought

08:56.411 --> 08:57.871
to be good.

08:57.912 --> 09:00.165
What's for lunch,

08:57.912 --> 09:00.165

09:23.855 --> 09:26.107
How's that for

09:23.855 --> 09:26.107

09:28.609 --> 09:31.363
Kimmy, you forgot to investigate

09:28.609 --> 09:31.363
who won the game.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.114
You've got to

09:31.405 --> 09:33.114
rewrite this.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.324
Rewrite it?

09:34.366 --> 09:36.576
You mean,

09:34.366 --> 09:36.576
write it again?

09:36.617 --> 09:38.537
Yes, with

09:36.617 --> 09:38.537
different words..

09:38.578 --> 09:40.288
...words about sports.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.498
If you think

09:40.330 --> 09:41.498
I'm so bad

09:41.540 --> 09:43.624
why did you even give

09:41.540 --> 09:43.624
me the job?

09:43.666 --> 09:46.086
I gave it to you

09:43.666 --> 09:46.086
because we're best friends.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.254
That's nepotism.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.671
It is not.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.965
It's favoritism.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.927
It's still an "ism."

09:53.968 --> 09:57.347
Look, Kimmy, I need a new

09:53.968 --> 09:57.347
article written right away.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.182
Then go ahead

09:57.389 --> 09:59.182
and write one.

09:59.224 --> 10:00.559
That's your job.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.894
What's your job?

Queen of the paper?

10:06.523 --> 10:08.608
Look, I'm the editor

10:06.523 --> 10:08.608
and I'm telling you

10:08.649 --> 10:09.901
to do this over.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.903
No way,

10:09.943 --> 10:11.903
I skipped my nap

10:11.945 --> 10:13.530
in algebra to write that.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.240
I'm not doing it.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.700
Well, then I guess

10:15.282 --> 10:17.700
you're not sports editor.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.744
Then I guess

10:17.742 --> 10:19.744
we're not friends.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.371
- Fine.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.540

Steph, not now.

11:06.958 --> 11:09.294
I've had a horrible day.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.963
Kimmy and I are never speaking

11:09.336 --> 11:11.963
to each other again.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.425
Gee, that's a shame.

11:15.467 --> 11:18.637
"Gee, that's a shame."

11:18.677 --> 11:20.263
Okay, big shot

11:20.305 --> 11:23.141
let's see you try

11:20.305 --> 11:23.141
and handle this.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.851
"I pledge allegiance to the flag

- Try that.

- "Try that."

"Aye, ye-yei, ye-yei."

D.J., I thought about

11:46.039 --> 11:48.583
what you said to me today

11:48.625 --> 11:50.210
and that's why

11:48.625 --> 11:50.210
I wrote this.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.794
Oh, Kimmy, you did

11:50.251 --> 11:51.794
the rewrite..

...on real paper.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.266

- And I'm Rebecca Donaldson.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.111
And starting next week, you'll

12:55.983 --> 12:58.111
be seeing a new and improved--

12:58.152 --> 12:59.946
Uh-ha, I'm sorry,

12:58.152 --> 12:59.946
I hate to interrupt.

12:59.987 --> 13:02.282
Here we go.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.242
At the risk

13:02.323 --> 13:04.242
of talking too much

13:04.284 --> 13:07.245
guys shouldn't we be waking up

13:04.284 --> 13:07.245
a little more naturally?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.497

13:10.873 --> 13:15.002
for being so perky

13:15.044 --> 13:16.588
but I thought the idea

13:15.044 --> 13:16.588
was to wake up

13:16.630 --> 13:19.382
with some energy.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.382
Right, pumpkin?

13:19.424 --> 13:20.675
Yes, sweetheart.

13:20.717 --> 13:21.842
I'll handle her.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.928
- You handle the tall one.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.928
- Okay.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.013
Aw, honey muffin,

13:23.970 --> 13:26.013
I love you.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.890

13:31.810 --> 13:34.147
Aw, honey muffin..

13:36.524 --> 13:39.110
...I love you, and I love

13:36.524 --> 13:39.110
the way you woke up.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.279
Mwah-mwah-mwah.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.448
There. Now you feel

13:41.321 --> 13:43.448
better, Danny?

13:44.532 --> 13:46.867
- A little bit.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.867
- Okay, alright.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.036
Now, come on,

13:46.909 --> 13:49.036
let's compromise here.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.456
Danny, when you wake up,

13:49.078 --> 13:51.456
wake up a little more..

13:51.498 --> 13:52.831
...pop tarty.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.167
Alright, sweetheart,

13:52.873 --> 13:54.167
when you wake up try to be

13:54.208 --> 13:55.834
a little more stiff,

13:54.208 --> 13:55.834
like your partner.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.545
Okay, a little more makeup

13:55.876 --> 13:57.545
for Miss Donaldson, please.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.422
Accentuate the cheekbones.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.422
Very nice.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.924
Watch the hair.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.924
Thank you, girls.

14:01.966 --> 14:06.471
- Uh, how do I look?

14:01.966 --> 14:06.471
- Danny...you're a fox.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.598
- Thanks, Joey.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.598
- Alright.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.890
Alright, let's try

14:08.640 --> 14:09.890
it again.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.393
I feel a lotta love

14:09.932 --> 14:12.393
in this room.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.729
And...action!

14:14.771 --> 14:16.314
- Cut!

14:14.771 --> 14:16.314
- Ah!

14:16.356 --> 14:17.691
Look, I ' sorry,

14:16.356 --> 14:17.691
just one more

14:17.732 --> 14:19.400
teensy-weensy

14:17.732 --> 14:19.400
little problem.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.820
How come all the lights are over

14:19.442 --> 14:21.820
on her side of the bed

14:21.861 --> 14:23.321
and I'm sitting here

14:21.861 --> 14:23.321
in the shadows

14:23.363 --> 14:25.906
like a troll

14:23.363 --> 14:25.906

Daniel, Daniel,

14:25.948 --> 14:27.074
Daniel.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.786
We...we feel that

14:27.116 --> 14:29.786
too much light

14:29.828 --> 14:32.330
may accentuate

14:29.828 --> 14:32.330
the angularity

14:32.372 --> 14:33.956
of your features.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.167
Are you saying

14:33.998 --> 14:36.167
my nose is too big?

14:37.544 --> 14:40.463
No, no, no, your nose

14:37.544 --> 14:40.463
is just the right size.

14:40.505 --> 14:43.132
Your face is just

14:40.505 --> 14:43.132
a little too small.

14:43.174 --> 14:45.259
Ha! Good one, honey.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.845
Thank you, sweetheart.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.722
Okay, let's just rehearse

14:46.886 --> 14:48.722
this beginning to end

14:48.763 --> 14:50.348
once with no stops please.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.767
That's right. Danny, perk it up,

14:50.390 --> 14:52.767
Becky, perk it down.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.061
And...action!

14:55.102 --> 14:57.021
- "Wake Up, San Francisco!"

14:57.063 --> 14:59.440
Hey, I'm the perky

14:57.063 --> 14:59.440
Danny Tanner.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.484
And I'm the stiff

14:59.482 --> 15:01.484
Rebecca Donaldson.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.778
And starting next week,

15:01.526 --> 15:03.778
you'll seeing a new

15:03.820 --> 15:05.279
and improved

15:03.820 --> 15:05.279
"Wake Up, San Francisco."

15:05.321 --> 15:06.740
It's warmer.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.032
It's friendlier.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.534
So let our happy home..

15:09.576 --> 15:11.661
Be a part

15:09.576 --> 15:11.661
of your happy home.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.205
Get yourself comfortable.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.624
Grab yourself

15:14.247 --> 15:16.624
a cup of coffee..

15:16.666 --> 15:18.125
And a pop tart.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.087
And join us every morning

15:18.167 --> 15:21.087
at 9:00 as we say..

15:21.128 --> 15:23.798
(Both)

15:21.128 --> 15:23.798
"Wake Up, San Francisco."

15:26.593 --> 15:28.386
- That looked really good.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.386
- Yeah, it works for me.

Are you still typing?

15:40.774 --> 15:43.109
"Are you still typing?"

15:43.150 --> 15:45.194
Michelle, aren't you tired

15:43.150 --> 15:45.194
of the shadow game yet?

15:45.236 --> 15:47.947
No way, Jose.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.407
"No way, Jose."

15:49.449 --> 15:51.075
Hey, that's my game.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.577
"Hey, that's my game."

15:52.619 --> 15:55.204
- I quit.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.204
- "I quit."

15:57.373 --> 15:59.041
I'm free!

16:00.042 --> 16:01.920
"I'm free!"

16:03.755 --> 16:05.632
Please give me

16:05.673 --> 16:07.926
"Please give me

16:05.673 --> 16:07.926

16:09.636 --> 16:11.763
I love this game.

[typewriter keys clanking]

16:17.644 --> 16:20.104
- Hey Deej.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.104
- Hey, how'd it go?

16:20.146 --> 16:21.689
Well, we shot

16:20.146 --> 16:21.689
a great commercial.

16:21.731 --> 16:22.732
Unfortunately, it took us

16:22.774 --> 16:24.734
24 coffee cups to get it.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.152
You keep saying

16:24.776 --> 16:26.152
it's my fault.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.612
- No, because it's, uh--

16:26.193 --> 16:27.612
- It's not my fault.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.072
Hey, hey, hey, no fighting

16:27.654 --> 16:30.072
in front of the kid.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.199
- Fine.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.662
It's okay, I 've been

16:33.576 --> 16:35.662
fighting all day.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.538
I fired Kimmy

16:35.703 --> 16:37.538
from the paper.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.165
You fired

16:37.580 --> 16:39.165
your best friend?

16:39.206 --> 16:41.584
Ex-best friend.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.336
Deej, I can't believe

16:41.626 --> 16:43.336
I'm actually saying this

16:43.377 --> 16:44.420
but don't you think you

16:43.377 --> 16:44.420
and Kimmy ought to try

16:44.462 --> 16:45.630
to work this out?

16:45.672 --> 16:48.174
I am, I'm working

I've got secrets stored up

16:50.760 --> 16:53.721
since kindergarten.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.349
Yeah, but you've been through

16:53.763 --> 16:56.349
so much together.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.225
You're a team.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.225
You're partners.

16:58.267 --> 17:01.312
Yeah, take a look

16:58.267 --> 17:01.312
at your dad and Becky.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.898
They'd never let a little

17:01.354 --> 17:03.898
squabble come between them.

17:05.274 --> 17:07.485
'They're way too mature

17:05.274 --> 17:07.485
for that.'

17:08.945 --> 17:12.031
Yeah, Deej, no matter what

17:08.945 --> 17:12.031
your differences are

17:12.072 --> 17:14.617
you and Kimmy have always been

17:12.072 --> 17:14.617
there for each other, right?

17:14.659 --> 17:17.370
'Cause you two care

17:14.659 --> 17:17.370
about each other.

17:17.411 --> 17:21.081
Deej, it doesn't take strength

17:17.411 --> 17:21.081
to hold a grudge.

17:21.123 --> 17:24.251
It takes strength

17:21.123 --> 17:24.251
to let go of one.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.629
Now, the most important thing

17:24.293 --> 17:26.629
in a friendship is forgiveness.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.341
- I'm sorry.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.341
- Oh, I'm sorry too.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.885
I'm sorry.

17:33.636 --> 17:34.804
You see that, Deej?

17:34.846 --> 17:36.263
Now, doesn't that

17:34.846 --> 17:36.263
make you wanna..

17:36.305 --> 17:39.183
...run next door

17:36.305 --> 17:39.183
and give Kimmy a big hug?

17:39.225 --> 17:40.518
No, not really.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.103
Thanks for the talk.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.648
I wonder if "Cheese for

17:43.145 --> 17:45.648
brains" is hyphenated.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.319
Well, at least our speech

17:47.066 --> 17:50.319
saved one friendship.

17:50.361 --> 17:52.238
Danny, if my perkiness

17:50.361 --> 17:52.238
ever gets

17:52.279 --> 17:53.948
on your nerves,

17:52.279 --> 17:53.948
you just let me know.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.616
And if I start talking

17:53.990 --> 17:55.616
too much or rambling

17:55.658 --> 17:57.410
or babbling, or just running

17:55.658 --> 17:57.410
off the mouth--

17:57.451 --> 17:58.745
Danny.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.454
I'll shut up.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.122
Okay, boys.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.416
This is the last time

18:02.164 --> 18:03.416
you'll see

Kimmy Gibbler

18:03.457 --> 18:05.251
in this house.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.378
I'm returning

18:05.292 --> 18:07.378
all your stuff.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.548
Jesse, here's your hairbrush.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.599
Here. You can keep

18:16.971 --> 18:19.599
the hair.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.976
Joey, here are

18:19.640 --> 18:21.976
your car keys.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.311
Time for a new car stereo.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.273

18:27.314 --> 18:30.192
And Mr. T., here is your

18:27.314 --> 18:30.192
answering machine beeper.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.987
By the way,

18:30.234 --> 18:32.987
call your mom.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.281
That's all I borrowed

18:33.029 --> 18:35.281
from you guys.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.783
Alright, Kimmy..

18:36.824 --> 18:38.242
...to borrow,

18:36.824 --> 18:38.242
you need consent.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.327
Otherwise,

18:38.284 --> 18:40.327
it's called stealing.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.204
Mr. T...I'll miss

18:42.246 --> 18:44.164

18:42.246 --> 18:44.164
most of all.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.638
I did it.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.723

19:03.101 --> 19:05.937
be Michelle.

19:18.449 --> 19:21.702
Tell Kimmy to leave

19:18.449 --> 19:21.702
my stuff and go.

19:22.954 --> 19:25.123
and your chicken legs

19:22.954 --> 19:25.123

19:26.916 --> 19:30.670
Tell your sister I want all

19:26.916 --> 19:30.670
of my stuff back too.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.255
Kimmy says she wants her stuff

19:30.711 --> 19:33.255
back so she can leave

19:33.297 --> 19:37.093
and never ever come

19:33.297 --> 19:37.093
back here again. Ever.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.219
I'll be happy to

19:37.135 --> 19:39.219
give it to her.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.350
Fine, here's

19:42.306 --> 19:44.350
the Bananarama tape

19:44.391 --> 19:46.477
you got me

19:44.391 --> 19:46.477
for my birthday.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.770
Shows what you know.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.856
I gave you Bananarama

19:47.812 --> 19:49.856
for Christmas.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.942
For your birthday,

19:49.897 --> 19:52.942
I bought you the bangles.

19:52.984 --> 19:56.988
Bangles, Bananarama,

19:52.984 --> 19:56.988
what's the difference?

19:57.030 --> 20:00.033
What's important is,

19:57.030 --> 20:00.033
you two are history.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.703
Here's your

20:02.118 --> 20:03.703
fanny pack.

20:07.081 --> 20:09.583
Here are your leg warmers.

20:22.013 --> 20:24.974
Your shrunken head.

20:25.016 --> 20:27.727
You guys had

20:25.016 --> 20:27.727
a weird relationship.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.981
This is not my

20:29.311 --> 20:31.981
shrunken head.

20:32.023 --> 20:34.775
Yes, it is, you gave it to me

20:32.023 --> 20:34.775
in the third grade

20:34.817 --> 20:37.361
at the carnival.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.155
Oh, right.

20:39.197 --> 20:42.116
We rode on the screaming siren,

20:39.197 --> 20:42.116
and you got sick.

20:42.158 --> 20:43.283
And you gave him to me

20:43.325 --> 20:45.119
to make me feel better.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.328
Yeah, and then

20:45.161 --> 20:46.328
you said it looked

20:46.370 --> 20:48.539
like our teacher Mrs. Hunt.

20:48.581 --> 20:52.292
Actually, Mrs. Hunt's head

20:48.581 --> 20:52.292
was smaller.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.628
Girls, why are we laughing?

20:54.670 --> 20:56.756
We are supposed to

20:54.670 --> 20:56.756
be fighting.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.095
We've been through

21:00.134 --> 21:02.095
a lot together, huh?

21:02.136 --> 21:03.637
No.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.892
Yeah. It would

21:06.057 --> 21:07.892
be a shame

21:07.934 --> 21:09.560
to give all this

21:07.934 --> 21:09.560
good stuff back.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.104
No.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.565
I'm sorry, Kimmy.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.151
I'm sorry, too, D.J.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.694
No.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.322
I'm sorry about

21:20.613 --> 21:22.322
"The Gibbler Gazette."

21:22.364 --> 21:24.075
I'll tear them all up.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.993
I hated what you

21:24.117 --> 21:25.993
wrote about me

21:26.035 --> 21:27.703
but loved the way

21:26.035 --> 21:27.703
you wrote it.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.830
You've got

21:27.745 --> 21:29.830
a real style there.

21:29.872 --> 21:31.958
How'd you like to be our

21:29.872 --> 21:31.958
new gossip columnist?

21:31.999 --> 21:33.167
Really?

21:33.209 --> 21:34.334
You want me

21:33.209 --> 21:34.334
to poke my nose

21:34.376 --> 21:35.669
into other

21:34.376 --> 21:35.669
people's business

21:35.711 --> 21:37.797
and spread wild rumors

21:35.711 --> 21:37.797
around school?

21:37.838 --> 21:40.549
You do it anyway. You might

21:37.838 --> 21:40.549
as well write it down.

21:40.591 --> 21:43.261
This is great! We can spend

21:40.591 --> 21:43.261
even more time together.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.598
Stop. You're killing me.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.600
"Stop. You're killing me."

21:51.894 --> 21:53.437
Hey, Kimmy..

21:53.479 --> 21:54.772
...wanna play shadow?

21:54.814 --> 21:56.774
"Hey, Kimmy, do you

21:54.814 --> 21:56.774
wanna play shadow?"

21:56.816 --> 22:00.778
- No, I hate that game.

21:56.816 --> 22:00.778
- "No, I hate that game."

22:00.820 --> 22:02.529
- I said no.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.529
- "I said no."

22:02.571 --> 22:04.949
- I really mean it.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.949
- "I really mean it."

22:04.991 --> 22:06.575
- Stop it!

22:04.991 --> 22:06.575
- "Stop it!"

22:06.617 --> 22:08.202
- Stop it!

22:06.617 --> 22:08.202
- "Stop it!"

22:08.244 --> 22:10.830
- I'm getting annoyed.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.830
- "I'm getting annoyed."

22:11.956 --> 22:13.582
- Michelle.

22:11.956 --> 22:13.582
- "Michelle."

22:13.624 --> 22:15.459
- I'm not joking.

22:13.624 --> 22:15.459
- "I'm not joking."

22:15.501 --> 22:16.794
- Enough!

22:15.501 --> 22:16.794
- "Enough!"

22:16.836 --> 22:18.378
- Stop it!

22:16.836 --> 22:18.378
- "Stop it!"

22:18.420 --> 22:19.880
- I'm serious.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.880
- "I'm serious."

22:19.922 --> 22:22.049
