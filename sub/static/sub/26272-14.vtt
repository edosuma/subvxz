11:33.170 --> 11:36.043
Why bother staying married
if you can't be faithful?

11:36.086 --> 11:39.350
Maybe you don't want
to lose someone, so you...

11:39.394 --> 11:42.702
start making compromises
with yourself.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.747
I don't understand it.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.794
And by the way,
neither will a jury.

11:47.837 --> 11:50.361
I don't know how
to sell this to a jury.

11:50.405 --> 11:52.320
Well, then let's not sell it.

11:52.363 --> 11:55.410
Yeah, but... we have
to present a case.

11:55.453 --> 11:59.153
You heard Nate-- he believes
his wife isn't actually dead.

11:59.196 --> 12:01.938
So maybe our defense is:
she isn't.

12:01.982 --> 12:03.461
BENNY:
Jury-wise,

12:03.505 --> 12:05.681
I'm guessing we'll be
looking to get rid

12:05.725 --> 12:07.683
of any potential Ava
Lewis Raynor superfans.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.816
They're gonna be looking
for someone to blame,

12:09.859 --> 12:11.818
and Nathan will be
sitting right there.

12:11.861 --> 12:14.124
I don't know, I'm still
kind of hoping they'll be

12:14.168 --> 12:17.562
the most desperate to believe
Ava is still with us, you know?

12:17.606 --> 12:20.217
It's like the people who think
Tupac faked his own death

12:20.261 --> 12:22.567
or Elvis never left
the building.

12:22.611 --> 12:25.048
I need a jury who will
go for our

12:25.092 --> 12:26.746
"no body, no death"
narrative.

12:26.789 --> 12:30.575
I need people for whom
seeing is believing.

12:30.619 --> 12:32.708
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.101
Anybody here believe in ghosts?

12:40.150 --> 12:42.370
Your Honor,
we'd like to thank

12:42.413 --> 12:43.980
and excuse
these three jurors.

12:44.024 --> 12:46.766
I'm confused. Isn't he supposed
to ask them a question?

12:46.809 --> 12:48.463
Somebody said
they believe in ghosts.

12:49.420 --> 12:52.075
Well... if they're willing
to believe in ghosts,

12:52.119 --> 12:53.990
they might be willing to
believe someone was killed

12:54.034 --> 12:55.949
without anybody being
able to find a body,

12:55.992 --> 12:59.430
and those are not the
kind of jurors we need.

12:59.474 --> 13:02.259
But we also need to be wary
of jurors with a propensity

13:02.303 --> 13:03.739
to blame the husband.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.524
That is a very real
and a very powerful bias.

13:06.568 --> 13:08.613
Anyone who feels
wronged or slighted

13:08.657 --> 13:11.573
by a current or former partner
might be more likely

13:11.616 --> 13:14.315
to hold Nathan responsible
regardless of the facts.

13:14.358 --> 13:17.187
So we need to weed out
anyone with an ax to grind.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.843
Good morning.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.672
Now, I couldn't help but notice
your beautiful wedding ring.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.239
How long have you
been married?

13:25.282 --> 13:26.936
Almost nine months.Nine months.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.330
[chuckles]: Wow. You're
practically a newlywed.

13:29.373 --> 13:30.853
Congratulations.

13:30.897 --> 13:34.161
And how is it going
so far, if I may ask?

13:34.204 --> 13:37.120
Hmm. I keep pinching myself.
My husband's a dream.

13:37.164 --> 13:39.296
I'm the luckiest girl
in the world.

13:39.340 --> 13:42.909
[quietly]: Marissa,
is there a reason not to?

13:42.952 --> 13:44.519
Yeah, I know
she presents well, Bull,

13:44.562 --> 13:46.782
but juror number two is
on husband number three.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.219
And she was so vindictive
toward her last ex

13:49.263 --> 13:52.396
that she papered his Yelp page
with bad reviews

13:52.440 --> 13:54.050
until his business closed down.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.878
Oh, my.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.098
We'd like to thank

13:58.141 --> 13:59.882
and excuse this
juror, Your Honor.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.102
Juror number two,
you're excused.

14:02.145 --> 14:05.540
What about you,
Ms. Nelson?

14:05.583 --> 14:07.020
Are you married?

14:07.063 --> 14:09.196
Nope. Single as single could be.

14:09.239 --> 14:11.198
Ah. And how do you
feel about that?

14:11.241 --> 14:12.939
Feeling good.

14:12.982 --> 14:14.505
I like dating.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.290
I've met lots of great guys.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.553
I just... always find
a reason to break it off.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.729
I think I'm just
one of those people

14:20.772 --> 14:22.818
that doesn't want
to be tied down.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.125
I think I've found "the one."

14:25.168 --> 14:27.127
Free spirit.
Doesn't hold a grudge.

14:27.170 --> 14:29.477
Please don't tell me
she's a serial killer

14:29.520 --> 14:32.045
with men buried under her house.

14:32.088 --> 14:33.916
All sunshine and rainbows
on my end, Bull.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.223
She doesn't spend a lot of time
on social media,

14:36.266 --> 14:38.703
but when she does,
she's usually trying to debunk

14:38.747 --> 14:40.314
her aunt's conspiracy theories.

14:40.357 --> 14:41.576
She likes facts.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.752
So we like her.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.363
This juror's acceptable

14:46.407 --> 14:48.148
to the defense,
Your Honor.

14:48.191 --> 14:50.367
JUDGE:
Then, ladies and gentlemen,

14:50.411 --> 14:51.891
we have our jury.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.109
[gavel bangs]

14:54.719 --> 14:55.851
DANNY:
Clara?

14:55.895 --> 14:56.896
Yes.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.158
Are you Danny?

14:59.333 --> 15:01.378
Thanks for coming down.

15:01.422 --> 15:04.338
I have a desk
at Ava's publisher's office,

15:04.381 --> 15:07.428
but this was her
favorite spot in the city.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.647
How long have you been
her assistant?

15:09.691 --> 15:11.258
Seven years.

15:11.301 --> 15:13.216
So you must really like the job.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.175
[chuckles]
Well, if you love books,

15:15.218 --> 15:16.916
if you love writing, it's...

15:16.959 --> 15:18.918
it's kind of like
winning the lottery.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.397
Ava let me edit her drafts.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.530
She helped me
with my own writing.

15:22.573 --> 15:25.098
Even offered to pass along
my work to her publisher.

15:26.142 --> 15:27.578
I mean, there was

15:27.622 --> 15:29.102
the normal stuff, too:

15:29.145 --> 15:31.974
pick up her dry cleaning,
run her dog to the vet.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.716
But that notwithstanding,
it was...

15:34.759 --> 15:37.632
kind of like a dream job.

15:37.675 --> 15:40.200
Well, she sounds like
a very nice person to work for.

15:40.243 --> 15:42.376
I know that these
last few days

15:42.419 --> 15:44.334
have had to be difficult.

15:44.378 --> 15:47.033
And I appreciate you taking
the time to meet with me.

15:47.076 --> 15:49.905
I'm told that you were
involved in almost...

15:49.949 --> 15:52.212
every aspect of Ava's life.

15:52.255 --> 15:55.258
I guess.And we know that Ava

15:55.302 --> 15:58.305
sometimes kept company with
people other than her husband.

15:58.348 --> 16:01.090
It would be
incredibly helpful

16:01.134 --> 16:02.483
for Nathan and his defense

16:02.526 --> 16:04.572
if you could provide me
with some of those names.

16:04.615 --> 16:07.401
I don't know where you're
getting your information,

16:07.444 --> 16:09.620
but Ava loved her husband.

16:09.664 --> 16:12.101
Ava adored her husband.

16:12.145 --> 16:13.798
I don't doubt that.
And I appreciate

16:13.842 --> 16:15.452
that you're trying
to protect Ava's legacy.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.411
But we know she
was seeing someone else

16:17.454 --> 16:19.021
and wanted to call it off.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.675
We just don't know who.

16:23.373 --> 16:24.984
Look...

16:25.027 --> 16:27.464
I don't know anything for sure,

16:27.508 --> 16:29.989
but after the last
Springersmovie premiere,

16:30.032 --> 16:33.035
Ava left a necklace
in her hotel room.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.559
I... went over
the next day

16:35.603 --> 16:37.257
to get it...

16:37.300 --> 16:41.348
and I also found a man's watch.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.306
It wasn't Nathan's.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.221
Do you know whose it was?

16:45.265 --> 16:47.310
Not for sure.

16:47.354 --> 16:50.400
But Chris wore one just like it.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.055
Who's Chris?

16:53.099 --> 16:54.796
Her driver.

16:54.839 --> 16:56.406
Her bodyguard.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.105
[gavel banging]

16:59.148 --> 17:02.673
Your Honor, in light of
the ubiquitous media coverage

17:02.717 --> 17:04.371
surrounding this case,
the People move

17:04.414 --> 17:05.981
to sequester the jury.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.330
Your Honor, please.

17:07.374 --> 17:09.680
Jury sequestration is

17:09.724 --> 17:12.509
an extraordinary
and unwarranted step.

17:12.553 --> 17:14.076
That's why
it's rarely used

17:14.120 --> 17:15.599
in the state
of New York.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.079
It costs
the taxpayers

17:17.123 --> 17:19.864
an exorbitant amount of money
and puts an undue burden

17:19.908 --> 17:22.780
on jurors by taking them away
from their homes

17:22.824 --> 17:23.999
and their families.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.523
Furthermore, this
jury was not selected

17:26.567 --> 17:30.092
based on who could bear
the burden of sequestration.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.399
There could be,
uh, medical issues,

17:32.442 --> 17:35.315
childcare considerations...Your Honor,
the People realize

17:35.358 --> 17:37.752
this is an extreme ask,

17:37.795 --> 17:39.536
but if ever a case
warranted it...

17:39.580 --> 17:41.147
JUDGE:
Though your argument

17:41.190 --> 17:44.324
is well-taken, Mr. Colón, given
the extraordinary attention

17:44.367 --> 17:48.023
this case has received,
the People's motion is granted.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.070
I order the jury sequestered.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.201
I don't understand.

17:52.245 --> 17:55.291
Why is a sequestered jury
so bad for us?

17:55.335 --> 17:58.077
This jury's gonna be cut off
from the outside world.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.080
They will be angry and
want someone to blame.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.908
And in their minds, you're
the reason they're here,

18:03.952 --> 18:06.302
so that someone
will be you.

18:12.656 --> 18:14.484
A background check on the
bodyguard, Chris, turned up

18:14.528 --> 18:17.139
a couple of misdemeanor
assault charges in his past,

18:17.183 --> 18:18.793
all domestic, all dismissed.

18:18.836 --> 18:22.144
Which is why the security firm
was able to hire him, but...

18:22.188 --> 18:25.060
he's a strong guy
with a quick temper
and no alibi.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.933
Claims he was home alone when
the cops think Ava was murdered.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.674
Well, that sounds promising.

18:30.718 --> 18:32.894
[sighs]:
Keep digging.CHUNK: Okay, uh,

18:32.937 --> 18:35.549
how are we gonna deal
with the sequestration problem?

18:35.592 --> 18:37.420
I still don't get
why it's a problem.

18:37.464 --> 18:40.031
I mean, is it just me,
or doesn't a hotel stay

18:40.075 --> 18:42.556
with someone else footing
the bill sound like heaven?

18:42.599 --> 18:43.818
Mm.
I mean,
who cares

18:43.861 --> 18:46.255
if the jury doesn't
get to watch the news?

18:46.299 --> 18:47.822
They aren't supposed
to anyway.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.563
BENNY: It's not
just the news.

18:49.606 --> 18:52.609
All the computers and
televisions are removed
from their rooms.

18:52.653 --> 18:55.917
Their only entertainment
will be group viewings

18:55.960 --> 18:58.920
of preapproved DVDs.

18:58.963 --> 19:01.749
They also handed over
their cell phones.

19:01.792 --> 19:04.055
Any calls with family
have to be on speaker

19:04.099 --> 19:06.841
from a court officer's phone
with him or her listening.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.538
Big Brother, anyone?

19:08.582 --> 19:09.887
Hey!

19:09.931 --> 19:12.586
It's not like they're
in some 4-Diamond property

19:12.629 --> 19:16.198
with a spa and day trips
to the local museum.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.287
They'll have takeout
from the same three restaurants

19:18.331 --> 19:19.593
every day.

19:19.636 --> 19:21.203
DANNY: Hmm. Point
of information.

19:21.247 --> 19:23.379
Wehave takeout from the same
three restaurants every day.

19:23.423 --> 19:24.728
But we don't
spend 24/7

19:24.772 --> 19:26.730
with only each other to talk to.

19:26.774 --> 19:28.079
A sequestered jury does,

19:28.123 --> 19:30.734
and that creates
a groupthink mentality.

19:30.778 --> 19:33.128
Okay, uh, not to pour salt
on the wound,

19:33.172 --> 19:34.912
but we go second, right?

19:34.956 --> 19:36.218
We are the defense.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.438
By the time
we get to make our case,

19:38.481 --> 19:40.744
won't they just be...
sick of the whole thing?

19:40.788 --> 19:42.833
BULL:
Yep.

19:42.877 --> 19:45.227
Unless they aren't.

19:46.533 --> 19:48.752
Well, the A.D.A. is smart.
To Chunk's point,

19:48.796 --> 19:51.146
she'll want
to slow-play her hand

19:51.190 --> 19:52.974
so that the jury is

19:53.017 --> 19:55.411
out of patience
by the time it's our turn.

19:55.455 --> 19:58.022
We can't let that happen.
We got to keep things moving.

19:58.066 --> 19:59.546
We need to show those jurors

19:59.589 --> 20:01.069
that we're on their side--
we want this thing

20:01.112 --> 20:03.332
to be over with
as quickly as they do.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.204
TRUMAN: So, is
it fair to say

20:05.247 --> 20:07.249
that the knife was
the murder weapon?BENNY: Objection!

20:07.293 --> 20:08.903
Asked and answered.

20:08.946 --> 20:11.558
The jury has already heard
Mr. Richards say

20:11.601 --> 20:14.125
it was the knife.JUDGE: Sustained.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.954
Isn't it true, Mr. Richards,
that DNA was discovered

20:16.998 --> 20:19.305
from both the defendant
and the deceased

20:19.348 --> 20:22.221
on the handle
of the knife?Your Honor,

20:22.264 --> 20:25.789
we just keep going over
the same ground again and again.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.530
The defense
will happily stipulate

20:27.574 --> 20:29.445
to the evidence at the scene.

20:29.489 --> 20:32.274
Anything to keep these
proceedings moving.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.233
Marissa, can you break out
some numbers for me

20:34.276 --> 20:36.583
on how the jury's feeling
towards the A.D.A.?

20:38.019 --> 20:40.021
Wow, show's you what Iknow.

20:40.064 --> 20:42.632
I wasn't sure your strategy
would actually work,

20:42.676 --> 20:44.939
but the jury
seems annoyed with her.

20:44.982 --> 20:47.942
Even better, they're starting
to view Benny as their champion,

20:47.985 --> 20:51.467
and some of that goodwill is
starting to flow Nathan's way.

20:51.511 --> 20:52.729
In light of this stipulation,

20:52.773 --> 20:54.296
do you have any more questions,
Ms. Truman?

20:54.340 --> 20:56.994
If not, I'm gonna turn
this witness over to Mr. Colón.

20:57.038 --> 20:59.780
As a matter
of fact, I do.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.173
In addition to
the weapon,

21:02.217 --> 21:03.871
what, if anything,

21:03.914 --> 21:07.701
do these spatter patterns tell
us about the crime itself?

21:07.744 --> 21:09.920
About who might have
done it and why?

21:09.964 --> 21:11.922
Well, there are two types

21:11.966 --> 21:13.402
of violent crimes:

21:13.446 --> 21:16.797
what we call instrumental crimes
and expressive crimes.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.800
An instrumental crime is likely
to occur between strangers

21:19.843 --> 21:21.541
and is usually a means
to an end.

21:21.584 --> 21:22.977
How do you mean?

21:23.020 --> 21:24.979
Someone kills a guy
in a convenience store

21:25.022 --> 21:26.981
to get the money
in the cash register.

21:27.024 --> 21:28.243
What you'll usually see

21:28.287 --> 21:30.071
is just enough violence
to get the job done.

21:30.114 --> 21:33.074
But that's not
what happened here?No.

21:33.117 --> 21:35.337
In this case, we're looking
at multiple stab wounds

21:35.381 --> 21:37.339
when one or two
would have been enough

21:37.383 --> 21:38.862
to end the victim's life.

21:38.906 --> 21:40.560
That's why
we call it expressive.

21:40.603 --> 21:43.258
It usually happens
when emotion runs high.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.129
It suggests
an intimate relationship

21:45.173 --> 21:48.263
between the victim
and the killer.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.439
An intimate relationship.

21:50.483 --> 21:53.399
Like a husband and wife?

21:53.442 --> 21:54.922
Like a husband and wife.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.750
TRUMAN:
So,

21:56.793 --> 21:58.839
if I were to surmise
that Nathan Raynor

21:58.882 --> 22:00.841
flew into a murderous rage

22:00.884 --> 22:02.930
at the news
his wife was leaving him

22:02.973 --> 22:05.193
and stabbed her
multiple times...

22:05.236 --> 22:06.368
BENNY:
Objection!

22:06.412 --> 22:09.763
Sustained.
You're pushing it, Ms. Truman.

22:09.806 --> 22:11.808
Apologies, Your Honor.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.114
I'll withdraw.

22:13.157 --> 22:16.204
No further questions.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.206
Remember what I said
about goodwill towards Nathan?

22:18.249 --> 22:19.903
I do.

22:19.947 --> 22:21.688
I think
I may have spoken too soon.

22:21.731 --> 22:23.385
BENNY:
Forensic Specialist

22:23.429 --> 22:24.734
Joaquin Richards.

22:24.778 --> 22:27.433
Let's talk
about expressive violence.

22:27.476 --> 22:29.478
Violence committed
by an intimate.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.262
Now, that intimate

22:31.306 --> 22:34.788
wouldn't have to be a husband,
would it?

22:34.831 --> 22:36.355
What do you mean?

22:36.398 --> 22:40.620
Well, couldn't it
just as easily be... a lover?

22:40.663 --> 22:42.143
[gallery murmuring]

22:42.186 --> 22:43.405
I suppose.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.320
But I'm not aware
of any evidence

22:45.364 --> 22:47.366
indicating that
to have been the case.

22:47.409 --> 22:48.889
Ah, evidence.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.543
[sighs]

22:50.586 --> 22:52.545
You know,
I-I must be missing something,

22:52.588 --> 22:56.026
but it looks to me
like all of this evidence

22:56.070 --> 22:57.637
that everyone's been discussing

22:57.680 --> 22:59.682
is very much open
to interpretation.

22:59.726 --> 23:02.424
Now, here's an example.

23:02.468 --> 23:05.471
Can you say without a doubt

23:05.514 --> 23:07.386
how many times

23:07.429 --> 23:10.171
the victim was actually stabbed
in that kitchen?

23:10.214 --> 23:12.695
Well, the patterns suggest...It's a yes or no question,

23:12.739 --> 23:14.697
Mr. Richards.

23:15.742 --> 23:18.266
No. I cannot.

23:18.309 --> 23:19.920
Hmm, I didn't think so.

23:19.963 --> 23:22.749
And can you remind the jury,
please?

23:22.792 --> 23:27.057
Is there any non-circumstantial
evidence that proves my client,

23:27.101 --> 23:29.233
Nathan Raynor,
was the one

23:29.277 --> 23:32.411
who committed whatever violence
occurred in that kitchen?

23:32.454 --> 23:35.370
Well, no. But...

23:35.414 --> 23:36.415
No! Of course not.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.373
And is there any real proof,

23:38.417 --> 23:39.853
any scientific proof

23:39.896 --> 23:42.246
that the blood found
in that kitchen

23:42.290 --> 23:46.381
is that of my client's wife,
Ava Lewis Raynor?

23:48.731 --> 23:50.341
Mr. Richards?

23:50.385 --> 23:53.344
No. The bleach
degraded the blood.

23:53.388 --> 23:56.260
But we did get enough DNA
in our sample

23:56.304 --> 23:59.307
to indicate a likely match
to Ava Lewis Raynor.

23:59.350 --> 24:01.701
Ah. Likely, but not certainly?

24:02.745 --> 24:04.965
Not certainly.

24:05.008 --> 24:06.619
BENNY:
So you have

24:06.662 --> 24:10.274
neither conclusive proof
that Ava is actually dead

24:10.318 --> 24:11.841
or that Nathan killed her.

24:11.885 --> 24:14.017
Objection! Compound.

24:14.061 --> 24:16.411
Overruled. The witness
will answer the question.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.673
No.

24:17.717 --> 24:19.936
I cannot prove
that Ava Lewis Raynor is dead

24:19.980 --> 24:22.069
or that her husband killed her.

24:22.112 --> 24:23.549
Thank you.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.942
No further questions,
Your Honor.

24:25.986 --> 24:28.597
Well, that worked out
quite nicely.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.120
[elevator bell chimes]

24:30.164 --> 24:32.253
BENNY: Where did Nathan
say he was gonna meet us?

24:32.296 --> 24:35.604
Sooner we can round him up and
head into the city, the better.

24:35.648 --> 24:39.652
Traffic heading into town is
gonna be horrible at this hour.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.571
I got this.Okay.

24:48.574 --> 24:50.532
Nate, you coming?

24:50.576 --> 24:53.666
We really need
to head back into town.

24:53.709 --> 24:57.060
All that stuff your lawyer said
in court today...

24:59.193 --> 25:01.891
Neither of you guys
really believe that.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.980
Do you?

25:04.024 --> 25:06.243
I believe you're my friend.

25:06.287 --> 25:08.550
I believe you love your wife.

25:08.594 --> 25:11.553
And I believe it's my job
to do everything I can

25:11.597 --> 25:12.815
to keep you out of prison.

25:12.859 --> 25:14.861
That's very well said.

25:16.863 --> 25:19.822
You're a clever man, Jason.
You always were.

25:19.866 --> 25:22.825
[exhales]

25:22.869 --> 25:26.916
Attorney-client privilege apply
to lifelong friends

25:26.960 --> 25:29.266
even though
you're not a real attorney?

25:32.313 --> 25:34.881
I'm part of your legal team.

25:34.924 --> 25:37.405
You can say anything you want.

25:37.448 --> 25:40.408
And even if I weren't...I did it.

25:40.451 --> 25:42.453
I did this.

25:44.455 --> 25:46.414
I didn't kill her.

25:46.457 --> 25:48.416
But I...

25:48.459 --> 25:50.461
but I caused it.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.115
I was the one.

25:52.159 --> 25:54.465
I cheated first. I...

25:54.509 --> 25:56.511
I broke us.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.951
I was this wildly successful
finance guy,

26:01.995 --> 26:04.606
and she was my adoring wife.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.436
Then the first
Springersbook hit,

26:08.479 --> 26:11.787
and suddenly she belonged
to the whole world.

26:11.831 --> 26:13.833
Not just to me.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.141
I couldn't handle it.

26:18.185 --> 26:20.796
My ego couldn't handle it.

26:20.840 --> 26:24.626
I don't know why
I let her success do that to me.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.628
Makes no sense, but...

26:26.672 --> 26:28.674
then I needed...

26:30.676 --> 26:33.635
Then I needed a shoulder
to cry on.

26:35.681 --> 26:38.031
So I went out and found one.

26:38.074 --> 26:40.076
And then another.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.557
And another.

26:44.559 --> 26:45.821
[chuckles softly]

26:45.865 --> 26:48.868
And then she found shoulders
of her own.

26:53.220 --> 26:55.178
[chuckles softly]

26:55.222 --> 26:58.573
So if some angry lover
killed Ava...

27:00.575 --> 27:02.577
...it was my fault.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.275
I set the whole thing in motion.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.496
I did it.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.543
[sighs]

27:14.197 --> 27:16.199
[phone vibrates]

27:22.118 --> 27:24.120
I'll be right back.

27:27.123 --> 27:30.300
Sorry to pull you away,
but we have a problem.

27:30.344 --> 27:33.216
The A.D.A. just called.

27:33.260 --> 27:36.350
A hunter and his dog just found
a corpse in the forest

27:36.393 --> 27:39.788
27 miles north of here.

27:39.832 --> 27:42.269
They found the body.

27:42.312 --> 27:44.314
They found Ava.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.193
Look at these jurors.
They're all red,

27:53.236 --> 27:55.369
and they're all miserable.

27:55.412 --> 27:56.675
They haven't even
had the thrill

27:56.718 --> 27:58.328
of being in court
for the last two days

27:58.372 --> 27:59.982
while they wait
for the medical examiner

28:00.026 --> 28:01.288
to finish examining the body.

28:01.331 --> 28:02.419
TAYLOR:
They miss their families.

28:02.463 --> 28:03.682
They miss their own beds.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.858
They miss food
that doesn't come out of a box.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.511
I don't think
it can get any worse.

28:07.555 --> 28:09.252
Oh, it can.

28:09.296 --> 28:10.863
And it will.

28:10.906 --> 28:13.039
We chose
a "seeing is believing" jury,

28:13.082 --> 28:15.737
and as soon as
the forensic testing is done

28:15.781 --> 28:18.044
and court resumes,

28:18.087 --> 28:20.916
they are going to actually see
that there actually is a body.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.223
A body that was
stabbed 12 times.

28:23.266 --> 28:24.790
By a kitchen knife.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.443
Most likely by
an intimate.

28:26.487 --> 28:28.184
Everything the
A.D.A. asserted.

28:28.228 --> 28:31.231
Sounds like it's time
for a plan B.

28:32.711 --> 28:36.192
What if we put the
driver/bodyguard on the stand?

28:36.236 --> 28:38.194
Chris?

28:38.238 --> 28:40.893
Ask him about the watch he
left behind at the hotel.

28:40.936 --> 28:43.591
Let the jurors pick up
on the inference.

28:43.634 --> 28:45.158
Maybe rile the
guy up a bit.

28:45.201 --> 28:46.942
Show the jurors
his temper.

28:46.986 --> 28:49.858
Let them see that he could just
as easily have been Ava's killer

28:49.902 --> 28:51.947
as Nathan.BENNY: Not bad.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.601
More reasonable doubt.

28:53.644 --> 28:55.559
I don't think
you want to go there.

28:55.603 --> 28:58.606
I've been going back over the
medical examiner's report,

28:58.649 --> 29:01.304
and there's a lot of postmortem
bruising on Ava's corpse.

29:01.348 --> 29:03.611
That points to somebody
really manhandling the body.

29:03.654 --> 29:05.004
Struggling with it.

29:05.047 --> 29:08.007
Having a hard time moving it,
burying it.

29:08.050 --> 29:11.227
Ava weighs 106 pounds.

29:11.271 --> 29:13.664
Her bodyguard could bench-press
that in his sleep.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.797
MARISSA: Yeah, but we don't need
to prove that Chris did it.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.103
Just that he could have.

29:17.146 --> 29:19.714
Well, I don't think
he could have.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.281
Dr. Bull.

29:21.324 --> 29:23.979
Oh, what do we have here?

29:24.023 --> 29:26.068
"Further investigation revealed

29:26.112 --> 29:28.114
"that the vast majority
of the wounds

29:28.157 --> 29:29.985
were on the left side
of the victim's body."

29:30.029 --> 29:31.682
And she was stabbed
from the front,

29:31.726 --> 29:33.772
which means the killer
was right-handed.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.208
Chris is left-handed.

29:36.209 --> 29:38.167
So, what's our play?

29:38.211 --> 29:40.474
BULL:
The only one we have.

29:40.517 --> 29:42.084
We put Nathan on the stand.

29:42.128 --> 29:44.652
Let him tell the truth and...

29:44.695 --> 29:46.654
hope to God
the jury believes him.

29:46.697 --> 29:49.396
Did you kill your wife,
Mr. Raynor?

29:50.440 --> 29:52.181
No.

29:52.225 --> 29:53.922
We made mistakes.

29:53.966 --> 29:55.663
Imade mistakes.

29:55.706 --> 29:57.230
But there wasn't a moment

29:57.273 --> 30:00.059
from the time we met

30:00.102 --> 30:02.801
that we weren't together here.

30:02.844 --> 30:04.803
Here.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.326
BENNY:
Thank you.

30:06.369 --> 30:09.024
No further questions,
Your Honor.

30:11.374 --> 30:13.333
No real movement here.

30:13.376 --> 30:15.422
Well, that's better
than the alternative.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.032
Let's brace for impact.

30:18.033 --> 30:19.861
Mr. Raynor,

30:19.905 --> 30:22.733
do you, by any chance,
wear reading glasses?

30:25.258 --> 30:27.477
Yes. I wear reading glasses.

30:27.521 --> 30:30.393
Could you describe
those glasses for me?

30:30.437 --> 30:33.396
Uh, well, I have
quite a few.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.834
Um, they're inexpensive.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.923
Usually get them
at the drug store.

30:37.966 --> 30:39.794
Usually buy black. 2.0.

30:39.838 --> 30:40.969
Marissa, why are we talking

30:41.013 --> 30:42.971
about reading glasses?
I don't know,

30:43.015 --> 30:44.712
and I don't like
that I don't know.

30:44.755 --> 30:46.888
I'm sorry, Bull. I-I'm
not seeing anything

30:46.932 --> 30:48.629
in discovery about
reading glasses.

30:48.672 --> 30:51.066
Nothing in the reports.

30:51.110 --> 30:54.113
Are these your glasses,
Mr. Raynor?

30:56.115 --> 30:57.420
I don't know.

30:57.464 --> 30:59.118
They look like they could be.

30:59.161 --> 31:02.469
Your Honor, the People would
like to enter into evidence

31:02.512 --> 31:05.689
this pair of reading glasses
found in a forest preserve

31:05.733 --> 31:08.910
five yards
from Ava Lewis Raynor's corpse

31:08.954 --> 31:10.781
and this report

31:10.825 --> 31:12.914
stating that several
of Nathan Raynor's cells

31:12.958 --> 31:15.961
were found on these glasses.

31:19.399 --> 31:21.488
I don't really have
any great answers

31:21.531 --> 31:23.316
for you.
Ava would borrow

31:23.359 --> 31:25.492
my glasses sometimes.

31:25.535 --> 31:27.668
That's all I can think of.

31:34.109 --> 31:35.458
The problem is,

31:35.502 --> 31:37.765
our "seeing is believing" jury

31:37.808 --> 31:39.941
is now convinced that,
when they're looking at you,

31:39.985 --> 31:41.987
they're looking at
your wife's killer.

31:43.466 --> 31:45.207
Are they right?

31:49.951 --> 31:52.258
I'm not a killer, Jason.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.086
You know that.

31:54.129 --> 31:55.957
You know me.

31:56.001 --> 31:57.959
Yeah, well,

31:58.003 --> 31:59.961
I thought I did.

32:00.005 --> 32:03.399
What, you mean
my-my marriage?

32:03.443 --> 32:06.054
[scoffs]
What do you want me to say?

32:06.098 --> 32:08.752
It's not something
you share with friends.

32:08.796 --> 32:11.320
It's not something
I'm terribly proud of.

32:11.364 --> 32:14.802
It does not make me a killer.

32:14.845 --> 32:17.718
I know.

32:17.761 --> 32:20.242
And I know this sounds
ridiculous, but...

32:20.286 --> 32:22.984
I thought you guys were it.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.987
[scoffs]
Nobody's "it."

32:26.031 --> 32:29.034
We're all just people,

32:29.077 --> 32:32.167
living our lives.

32:32.211 --> 32:33.516
[elevator bell chimes]

32:34.517 --> 32:36.519
[exhales]

32:38.260 --> 32:39.218
[knocking]

32:39.261 --> 32:41.002
Yeah.

32:41.046 --> 32:43.613
We were all thinking
of getting out of here.

32:43.657 --> 32:46.529
Do you need anything
before I go?

32:48.792 --> 32:51.534
[exhales]
I think my friend

32:51.578 --> 32:54.015
is gonna spend the rest
of his life in prison.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.409
And I think I failed him.

32:56.452 --> 32:58.541
And I'm embarrassed to say that,

32:58.585 --> 32:59.890
at one point today,

32:59.934 --> 33:01.544
I actually made the conversation

33:01.588 --> 33:05.635
about how he might have
failed me.

33:09.378 --> 33:10.858
Bull, come on.

33:10.901 --> 33:13.687
You haven't
failed anybody.

33:13.730 --> 33:15.341
This thing
isn't over yet.

33:15.384 --> 33:16.429
[knocking]

33:16.472 --> 33:17.865
They just want to know
if they can go.

33:17.908 --> 33:20.041
It's okay! Go ahead!
I'll be leaving in a minute.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.522
Can I show you something I was
just finally able to decrypt?

33:22.565 --> 33:24.393
Do you mind if I
turn on the light?

33:28.397 --> 33:30.747
[exhales]
What am I looking at?

33:30.791 --> 33:33.011
TAYLOR: Text messages.
Every number Ava texted

33:33.054 --> 33:34.316
during the last week
of her life.

33:34.360 --> 33:35.404
There are only four.

33:35.448 --> 33:37.363
Nathan, Chris,
her assistant,

33:37.406 --> 33:39.756
and her publisher.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.368
And where do I start?

33:42.411 --> 33:44.935
"I want to spare you
the soul-crushing pain

33:44.979 --> 33:48.069
of reading Clara's attempt
at a book."

33:48.113 --> 33:50.985
And who is she texting,
her publisher?

33:51.029 --> 33:52.247
Hmm.

33:52.291 --> 33:54.989
"Her novel is excruciating.
Unpublishable.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.295
"I'm just
gonna tell her

33:56.338 --> 34:00.429
"you passed
and let her down gently.

34:00.473 --> 34:04.781
I'm just giving you a heads-up
in case she asks about it."

34:04.825 --> 34:06.435
And this Clara...?

34:06.479 --> 34:07.567
She's Ava's assistant.

34:07.610 --> 34:09.177
She told me that
she was writing a book

34:09.221 --> 34:11.223
and that Ava promised to help
get it to the right people.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.834
And that proves...?

34:13.877 --> 34:15.444
[exhales]
I mean,

34:15.488 --> 34:18.708
if this Clara was angry
that her publisher rejected her,

34:18.752 --> 34:20.319
why would she go after Ava?

34:20.362 --> 34:22.277
TAYLOR: What if she saw
Ava's phone, saw the text,

34:22.321 --> 34:24.845
found out Ava never even sent
the manuscript?

34:24.888 --> 34:27.326
Mm. Well, the problem is,
it's just a theory,

34:27.369 --> 34:29.284
and the jury needs proof

34:29.328 --> 34:30.981
if they are going
to acquit Nathan.

34:31.025 --> 34:31.721
DANNY:
What about

34:31.765 --> 34:32.940
the postmortem bruising?

34:32.983 --> 34:34.768
I mean, it makes sense
that a female killer

34:34.811 --> 34:36.465
would have a much harder
time moving Ava's body

34:36.509 --> 34:37.597
than some big burly guy.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.599
A female killer.

34:39.642 --> 34:42.471
MARISSA: We were scouring
for sightings of a man.

34:42.515 --> 34:44.299
A supposed lover, not a woman.

34:44.343 --> 34:45.866
Let me go back
through the database,

34:45.909 --> 34:47.476
see if there are
any statements that mention

34:47.520 --> 34:49.478
a woman fitting
Clara's description.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.654
And I'll try and trace
where she was the day Ava died.

34:51.698 --> 34:54.875
Maybe there's traffic cameras
near the lake house?

34:58.400 --> 35:00.054
I'm sorry,

35:00.098 --> 35:03.840
you were saying something
about failing someone?

35:03.884 --> 35:05.712
Did I even say "come in"?

35:05.755 --> 35:07.540
Can't a man wallow in self-pity

35:07.583 --> 35:10.412
without his employees barging in
and pelting him with hope?

35:10.456 --> 35:14.503
People take all the fun
out of feeling bad.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.549
[grunts softly]

35:23.077 --> 35:24.296
BENNY: Good morning,
Ms. Larson.

35:24.339 --> 35:25.862
Really appreciate

35:25.906 --> 35:27.473
you being here.

35:27.516 --> 35:30.824
I know you must still be reeling
from Mrs. Raynor's death.

35:30.867 --> 35:32.652
I'm not sure
I'll ever stop reeling.

35:32.695 --> 35:34.219
Ah.

35:34.262 --> 35:37.570
Can you please explain
to the jury

35:37.613 --> 35:42.662
exactly who you were
to the late Ava Lewis Raynor?

35:42.705 --> 35:44.968
I was her personal assistant.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.883
Mm. In fact,

35:46.927 --> 35:48.146
she called you her other,

35:48.189 --> 35:49.147
didn't she?Mm.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.626
[chuckles]

35:50.670 --> 35:53.629
I'm sorry, I'm gonna need you
to speak your answers.

35:53.673 --> 35:54.848
Uh, yes.

35:54.891 --> 35:56.371
That's what she called me.Ah.

35:56.415 --> 35:58.721
And just to help the jury
paint a picture here,

35:58.765 --> 36:01.985
you were Ava's personal
assistant for over seven years.

36:02.029 --> 36:04.336
Isn't that correct?

36:04.379 --> 36:06.686
Yes. Seven years-plus.

36:06.729 --> 36:09.602
And what does being
a personal assistant

36:09.645 --> 36:12.213
for a famous novelist entail?

36:12.257 --> 36:15.129
Well, in the beginning,
it was mostly mundane things.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.218
Um, pick up her cleaning,

36:17.262 --> 36:18.480
take her
to doctors' appointments.

36:18.524 --> 36:19.960
But, over the years,

36:20.003 --> 36:22.049
it got much more...

36:22.092 --> 36:24.094
creative, much more intimate.

36:24.138 --> 36:26.358
Copy edit her early
drafts, discuss

36:26.401 --> 36:29.535
plot points,
function as a sounding board.

36:29.578 --> 36:30.753
Wow.

36:30.797 --> 36:33.626
So you really had
a front row seat.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.889
I-I'm guessing you
weren't just...

36:35.932 --> 36:38.674
intimately involved
in her creative life.

36:38.718 --> 36:40.328
You must have been

36:40.372 --> 36:43.810
very aware of what was
happening in her personal life.

36:43.853 --> 36:45.420
Well...

36:45.464 --> 36:46.900
to an extent.

36:46.943 --> 36:49.903
Um, we were really close.

36:49.946 --> 36:52.819
Which, I suppose,
was to be expected.Mm.

36:52.862 --> 36:55.474
And how were you compensated
for your work, Ms. Larson?

36:55.517 --> 36:56.562
Compensated?

36:56.605 --> 36:57.824
You mean paid?

36:57.867 --> 36:58.781
Mm.

36:58.825 --> 36:59.826
I got a salary.

36:59.869 --> 37:00.827
Every week.

37:00.870 --> 37:02.089
Anything else?

37:02.132 --> 37:04.874
Any... perks?

37:04.918 --> 37:07.747
I mean, you wanted to be
a writer, right?

37:07.790 --> 37:10.315
Did she offer any tips?

37:10.358 --> 37:13.883
Uh, promise to open up
some doors for you or...?

37:13.927 --> 37:15.233
Objection. Where
are we going?

37:15.276 --> 37:16.712
What are we doing?
Relevance?

37:16.756 --> 37:18.410
BENNY: I can assure the court
that the relationship

37:18.453 --> 37:21.021
between Ms. Larson
and the deceased

37:21.064 --> 37:24.851
is extremely relevant
to my client's defense.

37:24.894 --> 37:26.853
Overruled.

37:26.896 --> 37:28.724
BENNY:
Thank you.

37:30.596 --> 37:32.250
Didn't Mrs. Raynor

37:32.293 --> 37:35.731
offer to show your work
to her publisher?

37:35.775 --> 37:36.906
Yes.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.865
Yes, she did.

37:38.908 --> 37:42.042
And I'd bet you'd be
pretty upset if she didn't.

37:42.085 --> 37:43.913
Huh?

37:43.957 --> 37:47.787
After all of these years
of doing everything for her,

37:47.830 --> 37:49.919
if she went back on her word...

37:49.963 --> 37:52.226
Objection. Counsel
is testifying.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.793
Sustained.

37:57.187 --> 37:59.320
Now, you mentioned

37:59.364 --> 38:02.802
dropping Mrs. Raynor off
at appointments.

38:02.845 --> 38:04.891
You own a car, Ms. Larson?

38:04.934 --> 38:06.153
I do.

38:06.196 --> 38:07.328
A gray sedan?

38:07.372 --> 38:09.287
Is that correct?Yes.

38:09.330 --> 38:12.594
And where were you
on Monday the 28th,

38:12.638 --> 38:15.467
the night the police believe

38:15.510 --> 38:17.686
Ava Lewis Raynor was murdered?

38:17.730 --> 38:18.948
I was at home.

38:18.992 --> 38:20.298
By myself.

38:20.341 --> 38:22.865
Ah. Really?

38:22.909 --> 38:24.389
That's...

38:24.432 --> 38:27.174
that's interesting.

38:27.217 --> 38:30.786
Because a young lady
with blonde hair, about...

38:30.830 --> 38:32.397
your height,
your weight,

38:32.440 --> 38:34.355
your age was seen

38:34.399 --> 38:35.443
driving a sedan

38:35.487 --> 38:38.141
on the very night in question.

38:38.185 --> 38:39.317
Here it comes.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.361
Wait for it.

38:40.405 --> 38:41.797
BENNY:
A few days ago,

38:41.841 --> 38:45.366
after Ava's body was found
in the forest,

38:45.410 --> 38:47.412
the owner
of a nearby hardware store

38:47.455 --> 38:50.240
had reported that
he'd sold a shovel

38:50.284 --> 38:52.547
to a young blonde woman

38:52.591 --> 38:55.724
on the night we now know
Ava was murdered.

38:55.768 --> 38:57.857
Yeah, he said
that she was

38:57.900 --> 38:58.945
pretty anxious,

38:58.988 --> 39:01.164
even shaking a little.

39:01.208 --> 39:04.472
And after we reviewed
the in-store video,

39:04.516 --> 39:07.083
ooh, he was absolutely right.

39:07.127 --> 39:09.782
She sure was anxious.

39:09.825 --> 39:12.393
She was shaking.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.395
See,

39:14.439 --> 39:17.355
that's the thing
about crimes of passion.

39:17.398 --> 39:20.488
They're very difficult
to plan for.

39:20.532 --> 39:23.404
Someone's
always forgetting a shovel.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.711
[gallery murmuring][gavel banging]

39:27.582 --> 39:29.236
BULL:
Come on,

39:29.279 --> 39:31.151
was that worth the wait or what?

39:31.194 --> 39:33.849
You sure you weren't shovel
shopping that night, Ms. Larson?

39:33.893 --> 39:36.374
[loud murmuring]

39:36.417 --> 39:37.897
JUDGE:
Order!

39:39.333 --> 39:41.683
The witness
will answer the question.

39:41.727 --> 39:43.381
Ooh, that's okay.
That's all right.

39:43.424 --> 39:45.295
She doesn't need to answer.

39:45.339 --> 39:48.951
See, the store owner
got a partial license plate,

39:48.995 --> 39:52.520
and my office handed it over
to the FBI this morning.

39:52.564 --> 39:55.305
Th-They're actually searching
your car as we speak.

39:55.349 --> 39:56.872
I'm sure their findings

39:56.916 --> 39:59.440
will make the answer
abundantly clear.

39:59.484 --> 40:01.399
[exhales]
Thank you.

40:01.442 --> 40:03.575
No further questions,
Your Honor.

40:13.672 --> 40:14.977
[Nathan exhales]

40:15.021 --> 40:17.893
Still can't bring myself
to go inside the house.

40:17.937 --> 40:20.418
I should probably
just sell it.

40:20.461 --> 40:22.420
But the lake...

40:22.463 --> 40:25.771
the lake
reminds me of Ava.

40:26.946 --> 40:30.297
When I'm here,
it's like she's...

40:30.340 --> 40:33.431
still with me, you know?

40:36.172 --> 40:39.001
Nathan,

40:39.045 --> 40:41.526
I'm sorry.

40:43.745 --> 40:45.443
I owe you an apology.

40:45.486 --> 40:46.966
Are you kidding me?

40:47.009 --> 40:48.184
You kept me out of prison.

40:48.228 --> 40:50.099
I owe you.

40:51.144 --> 40:52.754
I said some things.

40:52.798 --> 40:55.148
I made some judgments.

40:55.191 --> 40:56.497
[sighs]

40:56.541 --> 40:57.803
I wasn't there.

40:57.846 --> 41:01.154
I wasn't inside your marriage.

41:01.197 --> 41:03.722
I'm sorry.

41:04.810 --> 41:06.855
It's okay.

41:06.899 --> 41:10.380
You're just a guy who loved
his wife the best he could.

41:10.424 --> 41:13.035
Nothing else really matters.

41:13.079 --> 41:15.690
I just hope Ava knew.

41:17.736 --> 41:21.000
I'm pretty sure she did.
