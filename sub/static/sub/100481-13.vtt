>> John: HELLO THERE!

00:34.008 --> 00:35.014
WELCOME AGAIN TO THE SHOW,

00:35.016 --> 00:36.004
WHERE I'M STILL STUCK IN

00:36.006 --> 00:37.006
THIS WHITE VOID.

00:37.008 --> 00:37.023
AND I DON'T ACTUALLY MEAN

00:37.025 --> 00:38.025
MY BODY.

00:38.027 --> 00:40.001
BUT NOW I MENTION IT, SCRATCH

00:40.003 --> 00:42.008
THAT, MAKE IT TWO WHITE VOIDS.

00:42.010 --> 00:43.026
LOOK, IT'S BEEN A TRULY BRUTAL

00:43.028 --> 00:45.007
WEEK, WITH PROTESTS ACROSS

00:45.009 --> 00:46.017
THE COUNTRY IN RESPONSE

00:46.019 --> 00:48.000
TO THE HORRIFIC KILLING OF

00:48.002 --> 00:48.024
GEORGE FLOYD AT THE HANDS

00:48.026 --> 00:52.023
OF THE MINNEAPOLIS POLICE.

00:52.025 --> 00:53.015
AND THERE IS CLEARLY A LOT

00:53.017 --> 00:54.011
TO DISCUSS HERE.

00:54.013 --> 00:55.002
HOW THESE PROTESTS ARE A

00:55.004 --> 00:57.008
RESPONSE TO A LEGACY OF POLICE

00:57.010 --> 00:58.010
MISCONDUCT BOTH IN MINNEAPOLIS

00:58.012 --> 00:59.020
AND IN THE NATION AT LARGE, AND

00:59.022 --> 01:00.025
HOW THAT MISCONDUCT IS,

01:00.027 --> 01:02.021
IN AND OF ITSELF, BUILT ON A

01:02.023 --> 01:03.017
LEGACY OF WHITE SUPREMACY THAT

01:03.019 --> 01:04.021
PRIORITIZES THE COMFORT OF

01:04.023 --> 01:05.013
WHITE AMERICANS OVER THE SAFETY

01:05.015 --> 01:06.026
OF PEOPLE OF COLOR.

01:06.028 --> 01:08.028
THERE IS SO MUCH TO SAY HERE --

01:09.000 --> 01:10.002
SOME COMPLICATED, MUCH OF IT ALL

01:10.004 --> 01:11.009
TOO CLEAR.

01:11.011 --> 01:13.001
OR, YOU KNOW...

01:13.003 --> 01:14.015
YOU COULD JUST GO ON TV, OPEN

01:14.017 --> 01:15.022
YOUR MOUTH, AND LET THIS SHIT

01:15.024 --> 01:16.019
FALL OUT:

01:16.021 --> 01:18.002
>> RIOTING IS THE ONE THING YOU

01:18.004 --> 01:20.004
DON'T WANT.

01:20.006 --> 01:23.000
UGLY OPINIONS, POLICE BRUTALITY,

01:23.002 --> 01:25.005
OFFICIOUS BIRD WATCHERS, RUDE,

01:25.007 --> 01:26.005
ENTITLED LADIES WALKING THEIR

01:26.007 --> 01:28.012
DOGS IN BIG CITY PARKS -- ALL

01:28.014 --> 01:30.015
OF THAT IS BAD, BUT NONE OF IT

01:30.017 --> 01:31.019
IS NEARLY AS BAD AS WHAT YOU

01:31.021 --> 01:32.025
JUST SAW.

01:32.027 --> 01:34.013
>> John: OKAY, FIRST: FUCK YOU,

01:34.015 --> 01:35.009
TUCKER.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.021
THAT'S JUST A GENERAL POINT.

01:36.023 --> 01:39.001
SECOND: SAYING "OFFICIOUS BIRD

01:39.003 --> 01:40.017
WATCHER" IS DEEPLY OFFENSIVE,

01:40.019 --> 01:41.026
BECAUSE YOU'RE EITHER TRYING TO

01:41.028 --> 01:43.021
"BOTH-SIDES" THAT CENTRAL PARK

01:43.023 --> 01:45.006
INCIDENT, OR INSULTING FANS OF

01:45.008 --> 01:46.010
THIS SHOW, WHO PROUDLY CALL

01:46.012 --> 01:47.007
THEMSELVES "OFFICIOUS BIRD

01:47.009 --> 01:47.020
WATCHERS."

01:47.022 --> 01:49.006
I AM THE OFFICIOUS BIRD.

01:49.008 --> 01:52.010
THEY ARE THE WATCHERS.

01:52.012 --> 01:53.003
KEEP THEIR NAME OUT OF YOUR

01:53.005 --> 01:54.003
MOUTH!

01:54.005 --> 01:56.014
BUT LOOK, THE LARGER POINT

01:56.016 --> 01:58.021
HERE, PEOPLE LIKE TUCKER

01:58.023 --> 02:00.013
LOVE TO VENERATE ORDER AT

02:00.015 --> 02:01.006
MOMENTS LIKE THIS.

02:01.008 --> 02:02.001
THAT'S EASY TO DO WHEN ORDER,

02:02.003 --> 02:03.010
IN ITS CURRENT FORM, IS DESIGNED

02:03.012 --> 02:04.015
TO BENEFIT AND PROTECT YOU.

02:04.017 --> 02:05.017
BUT IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE HOW

02:05.019 --> 02:06.026
CLEARLY WE'VE BEEN REMINDED

02:06.028 --> 02:08.019
LATELY OF THE HOSTILITY OF OUR

02:08.021 --> 02:10.000
EXISTING ORDER TOWARD

02:10.002 --> 02:11.011
BLACK PEOPLE, WHO HAVE BEEN

02:11.013 --> 02:12.024
KILLED BY POLICE ON THE STREET,

02:12.026 --> 02:14.002
KILLED BY POLICE IN THEIR OWN

02:14.004 --> 02:15.015
HOME, KILLED BY WANNA-BE POLICE

02:15.017 --> 02:16.024
IN THE STREET, AND THREATENED

02:16.026 --> 02:17.014
WITH STATE VIOLENCE WHILE

02:17.016 --> 02:18.023
LITERALLY BIRDING.

02:18.025 --> 02:20.027
AND COLLECTIVELY, THAT HAS JUST

02:20.029 --> 02:22.012
GOT TO BE SOME SORT OF BRUTALITY

02:22.014 --> 02:23.016
BINGO RIGHT THERE.

02:23.018 --> 02:25.005
AND WHEN "ORDER" RESULTS IN YOU

02:25.007 --> 02:27.018
LYING FACE DOWN ON A LAWN WHILE

02:27.020 --> 02:29.018
YOUR GRANDMA STANDS BETWEEN YOU

02:29.020 --> 02:30.023
AND THE POLICE WHO'VE PULLED

02:30.025 --> 02:31.025
THEIR GUNS ON YOU, AFTER YOU

02:31.027 --> 02:33.019
ALLEGEDLY JUST ROLLED

02:33.021 --> 02:37.019
A STOP SIGN, I CAN SEE WHY

02:37.021 --> 02:39.000
BEING LECTURED ABOUT THE

02:39.002 --> 02:41.003
IMPORTANCE OF ORDER AT THE

02:41.005 --> 02:42.018
EXPENSE OF ALL ELSE IS JUST NOT

02:42.020 --> 02:43.026
WHAT YOU WANT TO FUCKING HERE

02:43.028 --> 02:44.015
RIGHT NOW.

02:44.017 --> 02:45.010
AND IN THE INITIAL AFTERMATH OF

02:45.012 --> 02:46.007
THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD,

02:46.009 --> 02:47.002
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED

02:47.004 --> 02:47.029
CONDOLENCES, BUT YOU JUST KNEW

02:48.001 --> 02:49.000
SOMETHING WORSE WAS COMING.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.008
AND TRUE ENOUGH, IT SOON DID.

02:51.010 --> 02:53.029
>> THE PRESIDENT TWEETED,

02:54.001 --> 02:54.028
"THESE THUGS," ALL CAPS,

02:55.000 --> 02:55.027
"ARE DISHONORING THE MEMORY OF

02:55.029 --> 02:57.022
GEORGE FLOYD, AND I WON'T LET

02:57.024 --> 02:58.021
THAT HAPPEN.

02:58.023 --> 03:00.020
ANY DIFFICULTY AND WE WILL

03:00.022 --> 03:01.024
ASSUME CONTROL BUT, WHEN THE

03:01.026 --> 03:03.015
LOOTING STARTS, THE SHOOTING

03:03.017 --> 03:04.010
STARTS."

03:04.012 --> 03:08.005
>> John: WOW.

03:08.007 --> 03:10.005
SET ASIDE THAT

03:10.007 --> 03:11.014
WHEN A MAN LIKE DONALD TRUMP

03:11.016 --> 03:12.008
SAYS THE WORD "THUGS," YOU KNOW

03:12.010 --> 03:13.005
EXACTLY WHAT IT'S CODE FOR.

03:13.007 --> 03:14.018
"WHEN THE LOOTING STARTS,

03:14.020 --> 03:16.010
THE SHOOTING STARTS,"

03:16.012 --> 03:17.014
IS ACTUALLY A QUOTE FROM A

03:17.016 --> 03:18.007
NOTORIOUSLY RACIST 1960s

03:18.009 --> 03:21.024
MIAMI POLICE CHIEF.

03:21.026 --> 03:23.002
AND IT IS TRULY ASTOUNDING HOW

03:23.004 --> 03:24.009
DONALD TRUMP HAS MANAGED TO LIVE

03:24.011 --> 03:25.007
NEARLY 74 YEARS WITH A REMEDIAL

03:25.009 --> 03:25.027
UNDERSTANDING OF SPELLING,

03:25.029 --> 03:27.018
GRAMMAR, GEOGRAPHY, SCIENCE,

03:27.020 --> 03:29.017
CIVICS, NUTRITION, AND CHILD

03:29.019 --> 03:30.023
DEVELOPMENT, AND YET HE'S THE

03:30.025 --> 03:32.020
FUCKING LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA

03:32.022 --> 03:33.024
WHEN IT COMES TO RACIST MAXIMS

03:33.026 --> 03:38.005
OF THE 20TH CENTURY.

03:38.007 --> 03:39.005
BUT LOOK,

03:39.007 --> 03:40.017
FOR OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT,

03:40.019 --> 03:41.010
I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT

03:41.012 --> 03:42.011
HOW THE PRESIDENT SPENT

03:42.013 --> 03:43.012
THE FIRST HALF OF HIS WEEK.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.023
BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON, IN THE

03:44.025 --> 03:45.027
MIDST OF 40 MILLION AMERICANS

03:45.029 --> 03:47.021
UNEMPLOYED, 100,000 AMERICANS

03:47.023 --> 03:48.029
DEAD, AND RACIAL TENSIONS

03:49.001 --> 03:51.000
BOILING OVER, HE CHOSE TO SPEND

03:51.002 --> 03:52.010
HIS DAYS FOCUSING ON THIS:

03:52.012 --> 03:53.028
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP OVERNIGHT

03:54.001 --> 03:55.011
TAKING TO TWITTER TO TAKE ON

03:55.013 --> 03:57.024
TWITTER, ALONG WITH OTHER SOCIAL

03:57.026 --> 03:58.028
MEDIA GIANTS FOR WHAT HE CALLS

03:59.000 --> 04:00.017
POLITICAL BIAS.

04:00.019 --> 04:01.021
IT COMES AFTER TWITTER, FOR THE

04:01.023 --> 04:03.021
FIRST TIME, ADDED A FACT CHECK

04:03.023 --> 04:05.015
FOOTNOTE ON TWO OF HIS TWEETS

04:05.017 --> 04:06.014
THAT CALLED MAIL-IN BALLOTS

04:06.016 --> 04:08.021
SUBSTANTIALLY FRAUDULENT.

04:08.023 --> 04:09.025
>> John: YEAH, TWITTER

04:09.027 --> 04:11.000
FACT-CHECKED THE PRESIDENT'S

04:11.002 --> 04:11.017
TWEETS.

04:11.019 --> 04:12.020
THEY'RE ALSO APPARENTLY

04:12.022 --> 04:13.018
FACT-CHECKING OTHER TWEETS AS

04:13.020 --> 04:14.021
WELL, BUT CLEARLY NOT ALL OF

04:14.023 --> 04:16.012
THEM, BECAUSE WE JUST TWEETED

04:16.014 --> 04:17.023
"LUKE IS THE BEST HEMSWORTH,"

04:17.025 --> 04:19.002
AND SO FAR, THAT HAS NOT BEEN

04:19.004 --> 04:20.026
FLAGGED AS A DAMAGING LIE.

04:20.028 --> 04:22.007
AND COME ON, TWITTER!

04:22.009 --> 04:23.002
EITHER YOUR SYSTEM WORKS OR IT

04:23.004 --> 04:23.023
DOESN'T!

04:23.025 --> 04:25.016
IT IS A KNOWN FACT THAT THE

04:25.018 --> 04:27.007
ORDER GOES CHRIS HEMSWORTH,

04:27.009 --> 04:29.007
LIAM HEMSWORTH, NO HEMSWORTHS,

04:29.009 --> 04:30.022
THEN, LUKE.

04:30.024 --> 04:33.018
BUT IT IS WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT

04:33.020 --> 04:34.018
THE UNDERLYING STATEMENT THAT

04:34.020 --> 04:36.015
CAUSED TWITTER TO ACT -- TRUMP'S

04:36.017 --> 04:37.010
CLAIM THAT VOTING BY MAIL-IN

04:37.012 --> 04:38.026
THIS YEAR'S ELECTIONS WILL BE

04:38.028 --> 04:40.008
"SUBSTANTIALLY FRAUDULENT."

04:40.010 --> 04:41.010
BECAUSE THAT IS A FAVORITE

04:41.012 --> 04:42.020
SUBJECT OF HIS.

04:42.022 --> 04:44.007
HE'S TWEETED ABOUT IT

04:44.009 --> 04:46.001
A RIDICULOUS NUMBER OF TIMES IN

04:46.003 --> 04:47.004
THE LAST TWO MONTHS, AND BRINGS

04:47.006 --> 04:48.010
IT UP CONSTANTLY.

04:48.012 --> 04:48.029
>> MAIL BALLOTS ARE A VERY

04:49.001 --> 04:50.000
DANGEROUS THING FOR THIS

04:50.002 --> 04:50.019
COUNTRY, BECAUSE THEY'RE

04:50.021 --> 04:51.013
CHEATERS.

04:51.015 --> 04:52.021
THEY GO AND COLLECT THEM.

04:52.023 --> 04:53.010
THEY'RE FRAUDULENT IN MANY

04:53.012 --> 04:54.017
CASES.

04:54.019 --> 04:55.014
THE MAILED BALLOTS ARE

04:55.016 --> 04:58.017
CORRUPT, IN MY OPINION.

04:58.019 --> 05:00.002
AND THEY COLLECT THEM, AND THEY

05:00.004 --> 05:00.026
GET PEOPLE TO GO IN AND SIGN

05:00.028 --> 05:01.015
THEM.

05:01.017 --> 05:02.010
AND THEN THEY -- THEY'RE

05:02.012 --> 05:03.018
FORGERIES IN MANY CASES.

05:03.020 --> 05:05.018
IT'S A HORRIBLE THING.

05:05.020 --> 05:07.001
>> John: NOW, WHAT HE JUST SAID

05:07.003 --> 05:08.027
THERE WAS COMPLETE BULLSHIT AND

05:08.029 --> 05:09.015
ACTIVELY HARMFUL TO THE

05:09.017 --> 05:10.018
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

05:10.020 --> 05:12.013
BUT IN A WEIRD WAY, IT'S ALMOST

05:12.015 --> 05:13.025
COMFORTING TO HEAR HIM BUSTING

05:13.027 --> 05:15.007
OUT HIS CLASSIC 2016 HITS ABOUT

05:15.009 --> 05:16.012
VOTER FRAUD AND RIGGED

05:16.014 --> 05:17.005
ELECTIONS.

05:17.007 --> 05:18.018
IT BRINGS YOU BACK TO A SIMPLER

05:18.020 --> 05:20.023
TIME, DOESN'T IT, WHEN WE COULD

05:20.025 --> 05:24.013
GO TO RESTAURANTS FREELY, HAD NO

05:24.015 --> 05:25.022
IDEA WHAT ZOOM WAS, AND WERE

05:25.024 --> 05:26.010
SURE AN OBVIOUSLY UNQUALIFIED

05:26.012 --> 05:26.029
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WAS GOING

05:27.001 --> 05:29.004
TO LOSE IN A HISTORIC LANDSLIDE.

05:29.006 --> 05:31.008
OH, 2016, YOU TRULY WERE THE

05:31.010 --> 05:32.013
GOOD, OLD,

05:32.015 --> 05:33.006
ONLY-LESS-HORRIFYING-IN-CONTEXT

05:33.008 --> 05:35.008
DAYS.

05:35.010 --> 05:37.017
AND THE THING IS, VOTING BY MAIL

05:37.019 --> 05:39.012
IS A POPULAR IDEA -- 70% OF US

05:39.014 --> 05:41.010
ARE IN FAVOR OF ALLOWING ANY

05:41.012 --> 05:42.001
VOTER TO VOTE BY MAIL IF THEY

05:42.003 --> 05:43.010
WANT TO.

05:43.012 --> 05:44.024
AND IF THIS PANDEMIC CONTINUES

05:44.026 --> 05:46.000
INTO THE FALL, AS IT ALMOST

05:46.002 --> 05:47.025
CERTAINLY WILL, MANY VOTERS WILL

05:47.027 --> 05:48.028
WANT TO DO EXACTLY THAT.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT:

05:51.002 --> 05:52.015
HOLDING AN IN-PERSON ELECTION

05:52.017 --> 05:53.020
DURING A PANDEMIC IS AN ABSOLUTE

05:53.022 --> 05:54.023
NIGHTMARE.

05:54.025 --> 05:57.003
ELECTIONS USUALLY INVOLVE

05:57.005 --> 05:58.008
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE CYCLING IN

05:58.010 --> 05:59.012
AND OUT OF A SINGLE, ENCLOSED

05:59.014 --> 06:00.007
LOCATION.

06:00.009 --> 06:01.029
PLUS, POLLING PLACES ARE OFTEN

06:02.001 --> 06:03.008
LOCATED IN COMMUNAL BUILDINGS --

06:03.010 --> 06:04.024
LIKE SCHOOLS AND NURSING HOMES

06:04.026 --> 06:06.001
-- AND MANY OF THOSE ARE OUT

06:06.003 --> 06:07.009
OF THE QUESTION RIGHT NOW.

06:07.011 --> 06:08.009
EVEN KEEPING POLL WORKERS SAFE

06:08.011 --> 06:09.021
CAN BE DIFFICULT, BECAUSE,

06:09.023 --> 06:10.019
ACCORDING TO ONE ESTIMATE,

06:10.021 --> 06:12.002
WHILE THE TYPICAL VOTER MAY

06:12.004 --> 06:13.002
ENCOUNTER ONLY ABOUT 20 OTHER

06:13.004 --> 06:14.008
PEOPLE WHEN THEY GO TO THE

06:14.010 --> 06:15.025
POLLS, THE TYPICAL POLL WORKER

06:15.027 --> 06:17.025
WILL ENCOUNTER ABOUT 700.

06:17.027 --> 06:19.000
AND MANY ARE UNDERSTANDABLY

06:19.002 --> 06:21.002
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

06:21.004 --> 06:22.004
>> I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS

06:22.006 --> 06:23.024
IN MY TIME, BUT THIS REALLY

06:23.026 --> 06:24.022
SCARES ME, THIS KIND OF THING.

06:24.024 --> 06:26.006
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE IT.

06:26.008 --> 06:29.000
>> FOR McGHEE AND A MAJORITY OF

06:29.002 --> 06:29.018
POLL WORKERS, THEY'RE RETIRED,

06:29.020 --> 06:31.019
IN THEIR 60s OR 70s, AND HEALTH

06:31.021 --> 06:33.005
EXPERTS SAY THIS AGE GROUP IS

06:33.007 --> 06:33.022
AMONG SOME OF THE MOST

06:33.024 --> 06:34.021
VULNERABLE TO THE VIRUS.

06:34.023 --> 06:36.019
>> EVEN IF WE HAVE A LINE OF

06:36.021 --> 06:37.024
TEN PEOPLE, HOW ARE WE GONNA

06:37.026 --> 06:39.008
KEEP EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW,

06:39.010 --> 06:41.004
SAFE FROM THE GERMS?

06:41.006 --> 06:42.023
WE HAVE A TOUCH SCREEN.

06:42.025 --> 06:43.023
WE'LL HAVE TO WIPE THAT DOWN

06:43.025 --> 06:44.020
EVERY TIME.

06:44.022 --> 06:46.017
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE PEOPLE

06:46.019 --> 06:47.008
BRING THEIR OWN PENCIL?

06:47.010 --> 06:48.016
>> John: NO, OF COURSE NOT!

06:48.018 --> 06:50.012
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY

06:50.014 --> 06:51.025
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO, BUT ALSO:

06:51.027 --> 06:53.010
WHO THE HELL OWNS A FULLY

06:53.012 --> 06:54.014
FUNCTIONING PENCIL?

06:54.016 --> 06:56.010
I MEAN, SURE, YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE

06:56.012 --> 06:57.017
WITH A USABLE ERASER, BUT AN

06:57.019 --> 06:58.015
UNUSABLE TIP.

06:58.017 --> 06:59.017
OR MAYBE YOU HAVE ONE WITH

06:59.019 --> 07:00.003
A SHARPENED TIP, BUT THE

07:00.005 --> 07:01.005
ERASER'S GONE.

07:01.007 --> 07:02.011
OR MAYBE YOU'VE GOT ONE WITH

07:02.013 --> 07:04.004
A FUNCTIONING TIP, BUT THE

07:04.006 --> 07:05.004
ERASER'S ALL HARD AND LEAVES,

07:05.006 --> 07:05.018
LIKE, A BROWN STREAK

07:05.020 --> 07:06.023
ON THE PAPER?

07:06.025 --> 07:08.011
AND YEAH, YOU COULD SHARPEN ANY

07:08.013 --> 07:09.023
OF THESE PENCILS, BUT WITH WHAT?

07:09.025 --> 07:11.005
A PENCIL SHARPENER?

07:11.007 --> 07:12.025
YOU DON'T OWN ONE OF THOSE!

07:12.027 --> 07:14.003
OH, UNLESS YOU DO, IN WHICH

07:14.005 --> 07:15.012
CASE, JUST ANSWER ME THIS:

07:15.014 --> 07:16.015
WHERE IS IT?

07:16.017 --> 07:18.011
EXACTLY.

07:18.013 --> 07:19.021
IF YOU THINK YOU ARE IN ANY WAY

07:19.023 --> 07:21.007
PREPARED TO BRING A WORKING

07:21.009 --> 07:22.010
PENCIL TO A POLLING STATION,

07:22.012 --> 07:23.018
THEN YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE LIVING

07:23.020 --> 07:25.023
IN A FUCKING FANTASY WORLD!

07:25.025 --> 07:28.009
NOW, THAT WOMAN ACTUALLY DECIDED

07:28.011 --> 07:29.002
NOT TO WORK HER STATE'S PRIMARY

07:29.004 --> 07:30.001
OUT OF FEAR FOR HER SAFETY

07:30.003 --> 07:30.027
AND MANY VOTERS SHARE HER

07:30.029 --> 07:32.018
CONCERNS.

07:32.020 --> 07:37.013
BUT NOT ALL STATE OFFICIALS ARE

07:37.015 --> 07:38.002
ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS

07:38.004 --> 07:39.004
ESPECIALLY WELL.

07:39.006 --> 07:40.010
JUST LISTEN TO MISSOURI'S

07:40.012 --> 07:41.008
GOVERNOR MIKE PARSON OFFER

07:41.010 --> 07:42.010
ADVICE AHEAD OF NEXT WEEK'S

07:42.012 --> 07:43.013
LOCAL ELECTIONS THERE.

07:43.015 --> 07:44.026
>> YOU KNOW, I HOPE PEOPLE FEEL

07:44.028 --> 07:45.025
SAFE BUT, UH, TO GO OUT AND

07:45.027 --> 07:46.011
VOTE, BUT IF THEY DON'T,

07:46.013 --> 07:47.006
YOU KNOW, THE NUMBER ONE THING

07:47.008 --> 07:48.014
IS, THEIR SAFETY SHOULD BE

07:48.016 --> 07:51.013
NUMBER ONE.

07:51.015 --> 07:52.018
SO IF THEY DON'T, THEN DON'T GO

07:52.020 --> 07:54.006
OUT AND VOTE.

07:54.008 --> 07:56.015
I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD'VE EVER

07:56.017 --> 07:57.021
HEARD MYSELF SAY THAT, BUT IF

07:57.023 --> 07:58.018
YOU DIDN'T FEEL SAFE, THEN I

07:58.020 --> 07:59.002
WOULDN'T DO THAT.

07:59.004 --> 08:00.018
>> John: WELL, HOLD ON THERE.

08:00.020 --> 08:01.023
VOTING IS A RIGHT.

08:01.025 --> 08:05.024
IT HAS TO BE EASY TO UNDERSTAND

08:05.026 --> 08:07.006
AND ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE,

08:07.008 --> 08:09.009
UNLIKE, SAY, HBO MAX.

08:09.011 --> 08:10.010
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT,

08:10.012 --> 08:11.008
BY THE WAY?

08:11.010 --> 08:12.016
SERIOUSLY, DOES ANYONE KNOW?

08:12.018 --> 08:13.015
HOW DO I GET IT?

08:13.017 --> 08:15.010
I'M ON IT AND I DON'T KNOW.

08:15.012 --> 08:16.020
AND WHY IS IT SO PURPLE?

08:16.022 --> 08:18.004
IT'S LIKE I'M WATCHING

08:18.006 --> 08:18.029
TELEVISION FROM INSIDE GRIMACE'S

08:19.001 --> 08:20.001
ASSHOLE.

08:20.003 --> 08:22.021
AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY.

08:22.023 --> 08:24.024
NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO

08:24.026 --> 08:26.001
MITIGATE THE DANGERS, BUT

08:26.003 --> 08:27.023
PERHAPS THE BIGGEST IS EXPANDING

08:27.025 --> 08:29.020
THE OPTION TO VOTE BY MAIL.

08:29.022 --> 08:30.028
YOU KNOW, THE THING THAT TRUMP

08:31.000 --> 08:31.028
LIES ABOUT SO OFTEN, TWITTER

08:32.000 --> 08:33.020
FINALLY DECIDED TO STEP IN.

08:33.022 --> 08:34.025
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT

08:34.027 --> 08:36.027
WHY THE OPTION OF VOTING BY MAIL

08:36.029 --> 08:38.014
IS SO NECESSARY, WHY CONCERNS

08:38.016 --> 08:40.016
ABOUT IT ARE OFTEN OVERBLOWN,

08:40.018 --> 08:41.020
AND WHY TALKING ABOUT IT RIGHT

08:41.022 --> 08:42.012
NOW IS ACTUALLY REALLY

08:42.014 --> 08:43.029
IMPORTANT.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.016
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

08:45.018 --> 08:46.018
THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PRETTY

08:46.020 --> 08:48.003
GOOD LESSON FOR JUST HOW BADLY

08:48.005 --> 08:48.027
AN ELECTION DURING A PANDEMIC

08:48.029 --> 08:50.006
CAN BE BUNGLED, THANKS TO

08:50.008 --> 08:51.004
WISCONSIN.

08:51.006 --> 08:56.019
THEY HELD THEIR PRIMARY LAST

08:56.021 --> 08:58.013
MONTH, AND IT WAS ABSOLUTE CHAOS

08:58.015 --> 08:59.022
-- PARTLY BECAUSE THEIR

08:59.024 --> 09:01.000
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR HAD TRIED TO

09:01.002 --> 09:01.008
DELAY IT,

09:01.010 --> 09:02.002
ONLY TO BE THWARTED BY

09:02.004 --> 09:03.012
THE REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED STATE

09:03.014 --> 09:04.009
LEGISLATURE AND SUPREME COURT.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.006
AND THE REPUBLICAN ASSEMBLY

09:05.008 --> 09:06.009
SPEAKER, ROBIN VOS, TRIED TO

09:06.011 --> 09:07.007
REASSURE PEOPLE EVERYTHING WAS

09:07.009 --> 09:08.009
SAFE WHILE VOLUNTEERING AT

09:08.011 --> 09:09.005
A POLLING PLACE.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.001
BUT SOMETHING ABOUT HOW HE

09:10.003 --> 09:11.013
DELIVERED THAT MESSAGE WAS

09:11.015 --> 09:13.001
A LITTLE UNCONVINCING.

09:13.003 --> 09:13.023
>> YOU THINK VOTING IN PERSON IS

09:13.025 --> 09:15.001
PUTTING PEOPLE AT RISK TODAY?

09:15.003 --> 09:16.018
>> I DON'T.

09:16.020 --> 09:18.008
I MEAN, I LOOK AT THIS AND SAY

09:18.010 --> 09:19.005
TO MYSELF, WE HAVE EVERY SINGLE

09:19.007 --> 09:20.014
OPPORTUNITY TO BE SAFE.

09:20.016 --> 09:23.007
>> John: DO YOU, ROBIN?

09:23.009 --> 09:24.014
DO YOU?

09:24.016 --> 09:25.021
BECAUSE YOU'RE SENDING TWO VERY

09:25.023 --> 09:26.007
DIFFERENT MESSAGES THERE.

09:26.009 --> 09:28.015
YOUR MOUTH IS SAYING, "DON'T

09:28.017 --> 09:30.003
WORRY, EVERYTHING IS SAFE AND

09:30.005 --> 09:31.000
COOL," BUT IT'S BEING UNDERCUT

09:31.002 --> 09:31.025
BY THE FACT YOUR DRESS CODE IS

09:31.027 --> 09:33.026
"CHERNOBYL CASUAL."

09:33.028 --> 09:35.012
AND UNSURPRISINGLY, MANY DIDN'T

09:35.014 --> 09:36.026
BUY HIS ASSURANCES.

09:36.028 --> 09:38.012
DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, THERE

09:38.014 --> 09:40.005
WAS A MASSIVE REDUCTION OF

09:40.007 --> 09:41.021
POLLING SITES IN SOME BIG

09:41.023 --> 09:43.003
CITIES, WITH MILWAUKEE'S 180

09:43.005 --> 09:45.025
POLLING SITES BEING REDUCED TO

09:45.027 --> 09:46.023
JUST FIVE, RESULTING IN MASSIVE

09:46.025 --> 09:48.012
LINES.

09:48.014 --> 09:49.023
ADDING TO THE CHAOS WAS THE FACT

09:49.025 --> 09:52.020
A RECORD NUMBER OF MAIL BALLOTS

09:52.022 --> 09:53.015
WERE REQUESTED, HUNDREDS OF

09:53.017 --> 09:54.004
WHICH NEVER ARRIVED, OR ARRIVED

09:54.006 --> 09:54.018
LATE.

09:54.020 --> 09:57.003
ALL OF WHICH RESULTED IN SIGHTS

09:57.005 --> 09:58.013
LIKE THIS IMMUNOCOMPROMISED

09:58.015 --> 09:59.025
WOMAN CASTING HER BALLOT WHILE

09:59.027 --> 10:01.029
WEARING A GARBAGE BAG.

10:02.001 --> 10:03.006
AND NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WEAR

10:03.008 --> 10:04.008
A GARBAGE BAG BECAUSE THEY'RE

10:04.010 --> 10:05.018
TRYING TO VOTE.

10:05.020 --> 10:06.015
YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO WEAR ONE

10:06.017 --> 10:07.027
BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO SHED

10:07.029 --> 10:11.009
EXCESS WATER WEIGHT SO YOU LOOK

10:11.011 --> 10:12.009
EXTRA JACKED.

10:12.011 --> 10:13.005
OH, I HAVEN'T STOPPED MY PUMP

10:13.007 --> 10:14.001
ROUTINE JUST BECAUSE OF THE

10:14.003 --> 10:15.000
LOCKDOWN.

10:15.002 --> 10:16.019
I STILL CATCH THE DIESEL EXPRESS

10:16.021 --> 10:17.029
EVERY DAY -- THE SUN DOESN'T

10:18.001 --> 10:18.024
SHINE BEFORE THIS SWOLE-AR

10:18.026 --> 10:20.019
ECLIPSE RUNS ITS COURSE.

10:20.021 --> 10:21.011
YOU MIGHT AS WELL PUT ME IN

10:21.013 --> 10:22.018
A TORTILLA WITH SOME SALSA AND

10:22.020 --> 10:23.013
LIME, BECAUSE MY BEEF IS

10:23.015 --> 10:28.012
SHREDDED.

10:28.014 --> 10:29.029
AND LOOK, HAVING BEEN PUT IN

10:30.001 --> 10:31.022
THIS POSITION, YOU CAN

10:31.024 --> 10:34.015
UNDERSTAND WHY THE VOTERS IN

10:34.017 --> 10:35.029
WISCONSIN WERE SO PISSED:

10:36.001 --> 10:36.012
>> THIS IS SO WRONG.

10:36.014 --> 10:36.027
THIS IS JUST SO WRONG.

10:36.029 --> 10:38.001
THIS -- THIS ELECTION SHOULD

10:38.003 --> 10:39.015
HAVE BEEN CALLED OFF.

10:39.017 --> 10:40.004
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE TELLING US TO

10:40.006 --> 10:42.024
STAY IN THE HOUSE AND, YOU KNOW,

10:42.026 --> 10:43.013
STAND SIX FEET FROM EACH OTHER.

10:43.015 --> 10:44.022
BUT THEN, ONE OF THE MOST

10:44.024 --> 10:49.021
IMPORTANT TIMES, THEY'RE FORCING

10:49.023 --> 10:50.023
US TO COME OUT HERE IN A GROUP.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.024
STOP PLAYING POLITICS WITH OUR

10:51.026 --> 10:51.029
LIVES.

10:52.001 --> 10:54.001
>> John: YEAH, THAT MUST'VE BEEN

10:54.003 --> 10:55.000
FRUSTRATING.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.015
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRETEND

10:56.017 --> 10:57.021
CORONAVIRUS HAS STOPPED FOR

10:57.023 --> 10:58.029
A DAY IN ORDER TO DO AN

10:59.001 --> 10:59.026
ELECTION.

10:59.028 --> 11:01.003
IT DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT

11:01.005 --> 11:02.010
DEMOCRACY.

11:02.012 --> 11:03.008
IT'S JUST ONE OF THE MANY WAYS

11:03.010 --> 11:03.019
THAT COVID-19 IS

11:03.021 --> 11:04.017
THE DONALD TRUMP OF

11:04.019 --> 11:06.007
INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

11:06.009 --> 11:06.026
IT'S ALSO, OF COURSE, WEIRDLY

11:06.028 --> 11:08.010
SHAPED, AND DISPROPORTIONATELY

11:08.012 --> 11:09.016
HARMFUL TO MINORITIES.

11:09.018 --> 11:11.005
AND REMEMBER: THAT WAS JUST

11:11.007 --> 11:13.006
A PRIMARY.

11:13.008 --> 11:14.023
NOVEMBER'S GENERAL ELECTION WILL

11:14.025 --> 11:17.006
HAVE A MUCH HIGHER TURNOUT.

11:17.008 --> 11:18.021
SO HOW DO WE PREVENT WHAT

11:18.023 --> 11:19.010
HAPPENED IN WISCONSIN FROM

11:19.012 --> 11:21.009
HAPPENING 50 TIMES OVER?

11:21.011 --> 11:23.003
WELL, ONE OBVIOUS ANSWER IS TO

11:23.005 --> 11:26.029
MAKE IT EASIER TO VOTE BY MAIL.

11:27.001 --> 11:27.018
BUT SOME ARGUE THAT THAT'S A

11:27.020 --> 11:30.002
DANGEROUSLY RADICAL PROPOSITION.

11:30.004 --> 11:32.001
>> EVERYONE'S AFRAID.

11:32.003 --> 11:33.018
EVERYONE'S RETHINKING HOW WE DO

11:33.020 --> 11:33.025
THINGS.

11:33.027 --> 11:34.021
SHOULD WE DO IT A NEW WAY?

11:34.023 --> 11:35.018
AND THAT'S OKAY.

11:35.020 --> 11:37.004
WE SHOULD BE OPEN-MINDED.

11:37.006 --> 11:37.028
WHY HAVEN'T WE HAD MAIL-IN

11:38.000 --> 11:41.020
BALLOTS FOR THE LAST 230 YEARS?

11:41.022 --> 11:42.015
MAYBE THE REASON IS MAIL-IN

11:42.017 --> 11:44.006
BALLOTS ARE AN INVITATION TO

11:44.008 --> 11:45.006
WIDESPREAD FRAUD AND

11:45.008 --> 11:46.009
MANIPULATION.

11:46.011 --> 11:48.006
AND IF YOU WANT TO RATTLE

11:48.008 --> 11:49.021
PEOPLE'S FAITH IN THE SYSTEM

11:49.023 --> 11:50.022
THAT WE'VE HAD FOR CENTURIES,

11:50.024 --> 11:51.017
MAYBE YOU WOULD DO THAT.

11:51.019 --> 11:56.023
I DON'T KNOW.

11:56.025 --> 11:57.020
>> John: OH, I'M SORRY,

11:57.022 --> 11:58.012
YOU DON'T KNOW?

11:58.014 --> 11:59.020
WELL, FIRST OFF, TUCKER, THANKS

11:59.022 --> 12:00.015
SO MUCH FOR ADMITTING THAT.

12:00.017 --> 12:01.004
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH

12:01.006 --> 12:01.027
MODERN DISCOURSE IS THAT PEOPLE

12:01.029 --> 12:02.018
THINK ADMITTING A LACK OF

12:02.020 --> 12:03.007
KNOWLEDGE IS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS,

12:03.009 --> 12:04.009
WHEN IT'S NOT!

12:04.011 --> 12:05.006
IT'S HOW WE LEARN AND GROW AS

12:05.008 --> 12:06.028
INDIVIDUALS.

12:07.000 --> 12:07.023
SO IT'S REALLY HEARTENING TO SEE

12:07.025 --> 12:08.017
SOMEONE IN YOUR POSITION ADMIT

12:08.019 --> 12:09.006
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ALL THE

12:09.008 --> 12:09.017
FACTS.

12:09.019 --> 12:11.016
FACTS LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, WE'VE

12:11.018 --> 12:12.019
ACTUALLY HAD VOTING BY MAIL

12:12.021 --> 12:13.026
SINCE THE CIVIL WAR, AND THAT

12:13.028 --> 12:15.014
ONE IN FOUR AMERICANS ACTUALLY

12:15.016 --> 12:16.011
CAST A MAIL BALLOT IN THE LAST

12:16.013 --> 12:17.021
TWO FEDERAL ELECTIONS.

12:17.023 --> 12:19.009
SO YOUR PREMISE THAT VOTING BY

12:19.011 --> 12:21.006
MAIL IS A NEW IDEA THAT WOULD

12:21.008 --> 12:22.015
SHATTER DEMOCRACY IS, IN FACT,

12:22.017 --> 12:23.002
COMPLETELY WRONG AND DEEPLY

12:23.004 --> 12:23.013
STUPID.

12:23.015 --> 12:25.007
THAT'S NOT A REFLECTION ON YOU,

12:25.009 --> 12:26.021
THOUGH -- YOU JUST ENGAGED

12:26.023 --> 12:27.025
IN A DIALOGUE IN GOOD FAITH,

12:27.027 --> 12:28.023
SO THANK YOU.

12:28.025 --> 12:30.013
UNLESS YOU WEREN'T DOING THAT,

12:30.015 --> 12:32.024
IN WHICH CASE, GO FUCK YOURSELF,

12:32.026 --> 12:34.024
YOU HUMAN BOAT SHOE.

12:34.026 --> 12:36.022
SO CLEARLY, THE QUESTION ISN'T,

12:36.024 --> 12:37.011
"SHOULD WE HAVE VOTING BY MAIL

12:37.013 --> 12:40.029
AT ALL?"

12:41.001 --> 12:41.021
BECAUSE WE ALREADY DO.

12:41.023 --> 12:42.021
IT'S "HOW HARD SHOULD WE MAKE

12:42.023 --> 12:42.029
IT?"

12:43.001 --> 12:43.027
AND DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE,

12:43.029 --> 12:46.009
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION CAN

12:46.011 --> 12:46.018
VARY WIDELY.

12:46.020 --> 12:47.027
FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU LIVE IN

12:48.000 --> 12:48.008
WILL

12:48.010 --> 12:48.020
THESE FIVE STATES,

12:48.022 --> 12:50.009
CONGRATULATIONS.

12:50.011 --> 12:51.017
YOU ALREADY HAVE UNIVERSAL,

12:51.019 --> 12:52.024
ALL-MAIL VOTING, WHERE A BALLOT

12:52.026 --> 12:54.016
IS AUTOMATICALLY SENT TO EVERY

12:54.018 --> 12:55.028
ELIGIBLE VOTER.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.004
IF YOU LIVE IN THESE 29 STATES,

12:58.006 --> 12:59.006
YOU CAN REQUEST AN ABSENTEE

12:59.008 --> 13:01.015
BALLOT FOR ANY REASON.

13:01.017 --> 13:02.029
IF YOU LIVE IN THESE 16 STATES,

13:03.001 --> 13:05.011
YOU DO HAVE TO PROVIDE A REASON

13:05.013 --> 13:06.017
TO VOTE ABSENTEE, AND WHILE

13:06.019 --> 13:08.014
THESE 11 HAVE -- AT LEAST IN

13:08.016 --> 13:10.015
SOME CASES -- ALLOWED THE "FEAR

13:10.017 --> 13:12.000
OF CORONAVIRUS" TO BE A VALID

13:12.002 --> 13:14.022
ONE, THESE FIVE STATES HAVEN'T.

13:14.024 --> 13:17.021
ALSO: ALMOST NO STATES HAVE

13:17.023 --> 13:19.011
DECIDED WHETHER OR NOT IT'LL BE

13:19.013 --> 13:20.004
A VALID EXCUSE FOR THE GENERAL

13:20.006 --> 13:21.022
ELECTION THIS NOVEMBER.

13:21.024 --> 13:23.012
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN GETTING INTO

13:23.014 --> 13:24.027
SOME OF THE OTHER RESTRICTIONS

13:24.029 --> 13:25.020
STATES HAVE PUT IN PLACE, THE

13:25.022 --> 13:26.019
MOST RIDICULOUS OF WHICH IS

13:26.021 --> 13:28.011
ALABAMA, WHERE, TO VOTE

13:28.013 --> 13:29.020
ABSENTEE, YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT A

13:29.022 --> 13:31.022
PHOTOCOPY OF YOUR PHOTO I.D.,

13:31.024 --> 13:33.020
IN ADDITION TO SIGNING IT BEFORE

13:33.022 --> 13:35.019
A NOTARY OR TWO WITNESSES.

13:35.021 --> 13:37.004
AND THE ARGUMENT FOR PUTTING

13:37.006 --> 13:41.011
LIMITS ON VOTING BY MAIL IS THAT

13:41.013 --> 13:43.005
IF YOU DON'T DO THAT, PEOPLE

13:43.007 --> 13:47.020
WILL JUST CHEAT.

13:47.022 --> 13:49.002
>> THINK ABOUT THE VOTER --

13:49.004 --> 13:49.019
THE REGISTRATION RECORDS IN

13:49.021 --> 13:50.007
STATES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN

13:50.009 --> 13:51.004
PURGED.

13:51.006 --> 13:51.023
BY THAT, I MEAN, DEAD PEOPLE

13:51.025 --> 13:53.016
HAVE NOT BEEN REMOVED.

13:53.018 --> 13:55.005
YOU CAN REQUEST AN ABSENTEE

13:55.007 --> 13:58.009
BALLOT IN THAT NAME, HAVE IT

13:58.011 --> 13:59.017
MAILED TO A DIFFERENT ADDRESS

13:59.019 --> 14:01.009
SAYING YOU MOVED, BUT YOU KNOW

14:01.011 --> 14:02.015
THE PERSON'S DEAD, AND THEN SAY

14:02.017 --> 14:04.001
YOU'RE BACK AT THE OLD ADDRESS

14:04.003 --> 14:07.017
AND GO AND VOTE.

14:07.019 --> 14:09.007
>> John: OKAY.

14:09.009 --> 14:10.012
NOW WHILE THAT MIGHT

14:10.014 --> 14:11.012
SOUND PLAUSIBLE AT FIRST, JUST

14:11.014 --> 14:12.003
THINK HOW MANY STEPS YOU'D HAVE

14:12.005 --> 14:12.021
TO TAKE TO SUCCESSFULLY MAKE

14:12.023 --> 14:13.012
THAT HAPPEN.

14:13.014 --> 14:15.028
FIRST, YOU HAVE TO KNOW A DEAD

14:16.000 --> 14:17.019
PERSON -- THAT'S HARD TO DO,

14:17.021 --> 14:18.007
THEY'RE ANTISOCIAL.

14:18.009 --> 14:19.000
THEN, YOU HAVE TO KNOW THEY WERE

14:19.002 --> 14:19.019
REGISTERED TO VOTE WHEN THEY

14:19.021 --> 14:20.008
WERE ALIVE.

14:20.010 --> 14:21.003
THEN, YOU HAVE TO FILL OUT

14:21.005 --> 14:22.007
A FORM TO REQUEST AN ABSENTEE

14:22.009 --> 14:23.001
BALLOT BE MAILED TO YOUR ADDRESS

14:23.003 --> 14:24.007
INSTEAD OF THEIRS.

14:24.009 --> 14:25.024
NOW, TO DO THAT, YOU'D LIKELY

14:25.026 --> 14:27.004
HAVE TO REDO THEIR ENTIRE VOTER

14:27.006 --> 14:27.025
REGISTRATION.

14:27.027 --> 14:29.017
WHICH WOULD REQUIRE YOU TO KNOW

14:29.019 --> 14:30.016
PERSONAL INFORMATION LIKE THEIR

14:30.018 --> 14:31.023
ADDRESS, DATE OF BIRTH, THE LAST

14:31.025 --> 14:33.017
FOUR DIGITS OF THEIR SOCIAL

14:33.019 --> 14:34.007
SECURITY, AND POSSIBLY THEIR

14:34.009 --> 14:34.026
DRIVERS LICENSE NUMBER AND

14:34.028 --> 14:36.027
DATE WHEN IT WAS ISSUED.

14:36.029 --> 14:38.000
BUT OKAY, LET'S SAY YOU DO ALL

14:38.002 --> 14:39.011
THIS AND YOU GET THEIR BALLOT IN

14:39.013 --> 14:40.007
THE MAIL.

14:40.009 --> 14:41.016
YOU MIGHT ALSO HAVE TO KNOW WHAT

14:41.018 --> 14:42.008
THE DEAD PERSON'S SIGNATURE

14:42.010 --> 14:43.012
LOOKS LIKE TO CONVINCINGLY FORGE

14:43.014 --> 14:45.017
IT, BECAUSE IT COULD BE COMPARED

14:45.019 --> 14:46.004
TO THEIR SIGNATURE ALREADY ON

14:46.006 --> 14:48.027
FILE.

14:48.029 --> 14:50.001
AND YOU HAD BETTER HOPE THAT

14:50.003 --> 14:51.003
NOTIFICATION OF THEIR DEATH

14:51.005 --> 14:52.005
NEVER REACHES THE ELECTIONS

14:52.007 --> 14:53.028
OFFICE THROUGH ANY OF THE ROUTES

14:54.000 --> 14:54.015
IT COULD, AS -- DESPITE WHAT

14:54.017 --> 14:55.015
JUDGE JEANINE WOULD HAVE YOU

14:55.017 --> 14:56.019
BELIEVE -- VOTER ROLLS GO

14:56.021 --> 14:57.023
THROUGH PERIODIC LIST

14:57.025 --> 14:58.015
MAINTENANCE, INCLUDING

14:58.017 --> 14:59.014
CROSS CHECKING SOCIAL SECURITY

14:59.016 --> 15:01.008
DEATH RECORDS.

15:01.010 --> 15:02.015
AND HAVING DONE ALL THIS -- AND,

15:02.017 --> 15:04.014
REMEMBER, TOLD AUTHORITIES WHERE

15:04.016 --> 15:05.023
YOU LIVE -- IF YOU'RE CAUGHT,

15:05.025 --> 15:06.029
YOU'RE RISKING SEVERAL FELONIES,

15:07.001 --> 15:08.001
WHICH IN MANY STATES INVOLVE

15:08.003 --> 15:10.006
PRISON TIME -- ALL TO GAIN THE

15:10.008 --> 15:13.022
GRAND TOTAL OF ONE VOTE.

15:13.024 --> 15:14.027
IT IS A CRIME THAT'S DIFFICULT,

15:14.029 --> 15:15.015
HIGH RISK, AND LOW REWARD.

15:15.017 --> 15:17.002
IT'S AS IF AT THE END OF

15:17.004 --> 15:18.008
"OCEAN'S 8," WE LEARNED

15:18.010 --> 15:19.013
SANDRA BULLOCK HAD GONE TO ALL

15:19.015 --> 15:20.013
THE TROUBLE OF BREAKING INTO THE

15:20.015 --> 15:21.018
MET GALA TO STEAL A MAP OF

15:21.020 --> 15:27.004
STATE QUARTERS.

15:27.006 --> 15:27.028
SANDRA, WHY?

15:28.000 --> 15:28.022
THAT'S $12.50 WORTH OF

15:28.024 --> 15:29.014
QUARTERS.

15:29.016 --> 15:30.011
THAT'S A COMPLETE WASTE OF YOUR

15:30.013 --> 15:31.008
TIME, CATE BLANCHETT'S TIME,

15:31.010 --> 15:32.025
AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, RIHANNA'S

15:32.027 --> 15:33.024
TIME.

15:33.026 --> 15:35.018
AND LOOK: FRAUD CAN HAPPEN IN

15:35.020 --> 15:37.021
MAIL-IN VOTING.

15:37.023 --> 15:40.007
OPPONENTS LOVE TO CITE A 2005

15:40.009 --> 15:41.021
BIPARTISAN REPORT THAT SAID

15:41.023 --> 15:43.002
ABSENTEE BALLOTS REMAIN

15:43.004 --> 15:44.013
THE LARGEST SOURCE OF POTENTIAL

15:44.015 --> 15:46.019
VOTER FRAUD.

15:46.021 --> 15:47.027
BUT WHAT THEY DON'T MENTION IS

15:47.029 --> 15:49.002
THAT, IN PRACTICE, IT'S STILL

15:49.004 --> 15:51.001
INCREDIBLY RARE.

15:51.003 --> 15:53.028
IN OREGON IN 2016, OUT OF THE

15:54.000 --> 15:55.003
MORE THAN 2 MILLION VOTES CAST

15:55.005 --> 15:56.020
BY MAIL, THERE WERE JUST

15:56.022 --> 15:57.026
54 CASES OF SUSPECTED

15:57.028 --> 16:01.010
VOTER FRAUD.

16:01.012 --> 16:02.027
THAT IS 0.002%.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.021
AND TO HEAR OREGON'S FORMER

16:04.023 --> 16:05.016
SECRETARY OF STATE TELL IT,

16:05.018 --> 16:06.007
THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD

16:06.009 --> 16:07.010
EXPLANATION FOR THAT.

16:07.012 --> 16:10.009
>> THE VAST MAJORITY OF

16:10.011 --> 16:12.022
OREGONIANS ARE -- DON'T CARE

16:12.024 --> 16:14.001
ABOUT POLITICS TO THE LEVEL THAT

16:14.003 --> 16:15.010
THEY'RE WILLING TO RISK PRISON

16:15.012 --> 16:16.008
TIME FOR IT.

16:16.010 --> 16:17.017
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE THEY

16:17.019 --> 16:18.014
DON'T!

16:18.016 --> 16:21.009
THE ONLY VOTE OREGONIANS WOULD

16:21.011 --> 16:22.016
RISK PRISON OVER WOULD BE A VOTE

16:22.018 --> 16:23.016
TO GET PORTLAND TRAILBLAZER

16:23.018 --> 16:25.016
DAMIAN LILLARD INTO THE MVP

16:25.018 --> 16:28.018
CONVERSATION.

16:28.020 --> 16:29.025
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:29.027 --> 16:30.029
AND THEY'D BE RIGHT, DAME DOLLA

16:31.001 --> 16:31.025
FOR LIFE.

16:31.027 --> 16:33.003
AND LOOK: I'M NOT SAYING VOTING

16:33.005 --> 16:34.004
BY MAIL IS PERFECT.

16:34.006 --> 16:35.009
MAILED BALLOTS ARE REJECTED

16:35.011 --> 16:36.006
AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THOSE CAST

16:36.008 --> 16:36.026
IN PERSON.

16:36.028 --> 16:39.004
AND IT DOESN'T WORK FOR ALL

16:39.006 --> 16:40.003
COMMUNITIES.

16:40.005 --> 16:41.009
SOME PEOPLE WITH

16:41.011 --> 16:42.004
DISABILITIES NEED TO GO TO AN

16:42.006 --> 16:43.012
IN-PERSON VOTING PLACE FOR HELP

16:43.014 --> 16:44.003
CASTING A BALLOT, AND PLACES

16:44.005 --> 16:45.015
LIKE NATIVE AMERICAN

16:45.017 --> 16:46.004
RESERVATIONS AND REMOTE ALASKAN

16:46.006 --> 16:47.029
VILLAGES MAY HAVE UNRELIABLE

16:48.001 --> 16:48.010
POSTAL SERVICE.

16:48.012 --> 16:50.010
PLUS, IF YOU VOTE BY MAIL, YOU

16:50.012 --> 16:51.021
PROBABLY DON'T GET ONE OF THOSE

16:51.023 --> 16:52.021
"I VOTED" STICKERS.

16:52.023 --> 16:54.008
WHICH, IF YOU LIVE IN LOUISIANA,

16:54.010 --> 16:59.022
MEANS YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE GOT

16:59.024 --> 17:02.017
THIS ACTUAL STICKER,

17:02.019 --> 17:07.002
FEATURING A TR EXCELLENT PELICA.

17:07.004 --> 17:08.020
LOOK AT THIS ABSOLUTE KING.

17:08.022 --> 17:09.026
IT'S HARD TO PICK MY FAVORITE

17:09.028 --> 17:10.022
PART OF THAT.

17:10.024 --> 17:11.024
HIS STEELY BLUE GAZE.

17:11.026 --> 17:12.017
HIS CROWN THAT SAYS "THE STATE

17:12.019 --> 17:13.018
OF LOUISIANA HAS A MONARCH, AND

17:13.020 --> 17:14.018
I AM IT," OR HIS

17:14.020 --> 17:15.015
PROMINENTLY-DISPLAYED EARRING

17:15.017 --> 17:16.018
DESPITE NOT HAVING ANY EARS TO

17:16.020 --> 17:19.006
SPEAK OF.

17:19.008 --> 17:20.023
NO QUESTION HERE:

17:20.025 --> 17:21.029
THAT LARGE WATER BIRD FUCKS.

17:22.001 --> 17:22.018
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE MOTIVATOR TO

17:22.020 --> 17:23.015
GET OUT AND VOTE IN LOUISIANA,

17:23.017 --> 17:24.019
THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY BACKFIRE

17:24.021 --> 17:25.009
WHEN EVERYONE WRITES IN THAT

17:25.011 --> 17:26.004
PELICAN AS THEIR CHOICE FOR

17:26.006 --> 17:27.019
GOVERNOR.

17:27.021 --> 17:30.006
BUT ADVOCATES ARGUE VOTE BY MAIL

17:30.008 --> 17:31.010
IS STILL A GOOD IDEA THAT WOULD

17:31.012 --> 17:34.011
REDUCE OBSTACLES TO CIVIC

17:34.013 --> 17:34.021
PARTICIPATION.

17:34.023 --> 17:37.009
BUT THAT, IN ITLF, MIGHT BE

17:37.011 --> 17:37.021
WHY IT'S BECOME SO

17:37.023 --> 17:39.009
CONTROVERSIAL.

17:39.011 --> 17:40.022
CONSERVATIVE OPPONENTS OFTEN

17:40.024 --> 17:41.029
SPECULATE THAT ANY INCREASED

17:42.001 --> 17:43.028
PARTICIPATION WOULD BENEFIT

17:44.000 --> 17:45.020
DEMOCRATS, DESPITE THE FACT

17:45.022 --> 17:47.024
RESEARCHERS HAVE CONSISTENTLY

17:47.026 --> 17:49.000
FOUND THAT IT HASN'T OBVIOUSLY

17:49.002 --> 17:49.029
HELPED ONE PARTY OR THE OTHER.

17:50.001 --> 17:51.023
AND YET, SOME ARE WILLING TO GO

17:51.025 --> 17:53.025
TO EXTREMES TO FIGHT THIS.

17:53.027 --> 17:55.025
TEXAS'S A.G. THREATENED TO

17:55.027 --> 17:57.013
PROSECUTE ANYONE WHO ENCOURAGED

17:57.015 --> 17:58.005
PEOPLE TO GET AN ABSENTEE BALLOT

17:58.007 --> 17:59.009
BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF THE

17:59.011 --> 18:00.017
CORONAVIRUS.

18:00.019 --> 18:03.006
AND THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

18:03.008 --> 18:06.028
THERE HAS BEEN DOING SOME TRULY

18:07.000 --> 18:07.019
TRUMP-CALIBER LEVEL

18:07.021 --> 18:08.017
FEARMONGERING:

18:08.019 --> 18:09.021
>> WHEN YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

18:09.023 --> 18:12.010
TO STEAL A VOTE, THE DEMOCRATS

18:12.012 --> 18:13.002
WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT, AND

18:13.004 --> 18:14.000
THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

18:14.002 --> 18:15.012
THERE IS NO REASON --

18:15.014 --> 18:16.017
CAPITAL N, CAPITAL O -- NO

18:16.019 --> 18:17.009
REASON THAT ANYONE UNDER 65

18:17.011 --> 18:18.003
SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY,

18:18.005 --> 18:18.024
"I'M AFRAID TO GO VOTE."

18:18.026 --> 18:19.012
HAVE THEY BEEN TO A GROCERY

18:19.014 --> 18:19.022
STORE?

18:19.024 --> 18:20.021
HAVE THEY BEEN TO WALMART?

18:20.023 --> 18:21.014
HAVE THEY BEEN TO LOWE'S?

18:21.016 --> 18:22.004
HAVE THEY BEEN TO HOME DEPOT?

18:22.006 --> 18:23.006
HAVE THEY BEEN ANYWHERE?

18:23.008 --> 18:24.027
HAVE THEY BEEN AFRAID TO GO OUT

18:24.029 --> 18:25.008
OF THEIR HOUSE?

18:25.010 --> 18:26.006
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A SCAM BY THE

18:26.008 --> 18:28.014
DEMOCRATS TO STEAL THE ELECTION.

18:28.016 --> 18:30.014
>> John: LOOK: FAR BE IT FOR ME

18:30.016 --> 18:31.025
TO CHALLENGE THE WISDOM OF A

18:31.027 --> 18:33.024
WELL-READ GUY WHOSE BOOKSHELF IS

18:33.026 --> 18:36.008
ONLY HALF-OCCUPIED BY FOOTBALLS.

18:36.010 --> 18:38.002
BUT GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE

18:38.004 --> 18:39.027
DOESN'T MEAN PEOPLE AREN'T

18:39.029 --> 18:40.015
AFRAID, IT MEANS THEY NEED TO

18:40.017 --> 18:40.021
EAT.

18:40.023 --> 18:42.015
AT A CERTAIN POINT,

18:42.017 --> 18:43.029
HUNGER OUTWEIGHS FEAR.

18:44.001 --> 18:45.019
WHICH IS ALSO, INCIDENTALLY, THE

18:45.021 --> 18:48.022
OFFICIAL SLOGAN OF TACO BELL.

18:48.024 --> 18:51.004
BUT EVEN IN STATES THAT TRY TO

18:51.006 --> 18:52.008
FIGHT IT, THE ODDS ARE, THERE

18:52.010 --> 18:53.024
WILL BE A LOT MORE PEOPLE VOTING

18:53.026 --> 18:56.024
BY MAIL COME THIS FALL.

18:56.026 --> 18:57.021
WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR FINAL

18:57.023 --> 18:58.014
POINT: HOW WILL STATES HANDLE

18:58.016 --> 18:59.005
THAT?

18:59.007 --> 19:01.018
WELL, FIRST, THEY NEED MONEY.

19:01.020 --> 19:02.010
FAST.

19:02.012 --> 19:03.005
SOME ESTIMATE THE COSTS OF

19:03.007 --> 19:04.016
PROPERLY RUNNING THE 2020

19:04.018 --> 19:05.029
ELECTIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC

19:06.001 --> 19:06.029
COULD REACH $4 BILLION.

19:07.001 --> 19:10.005
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE CARES ACT

19:10.007 --> 19:11.012
DIRECTED JUST $400 MILLION TO

19:11.014 --> 19:12.019
STATES, WHICH IS JUST NOWHERE

19:12.021 --> 19:13.010
NEAR ENOUGH.

19:13.012 --> 19:14.003
AND THIS FUNDING NEEDS TO COME

19:14.005 --> 19:15.020
QUICKLY.

19:15.022 --> 19:17.002
SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE GOING TO

19:17.004 --> 19:20.024
STRUGGLE TO HANDLE A HIGH VOLUME

19:20.026 --> 19:23.015
OF MAIL BALLOTS.

19:23.017 --> 19:24.016
IN FACT, TAKE THE SWING

19:24.018 --> 19:25.015
STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, WHICH

19:25.017 --> 19:26.004
ONLY HAD 107,000 ABSENTEE

19:26.006 --> 19:27.015
BALLOTS IN THEIR 2016 PRIMARY,

19:27.017 --> 19:28.025
BUT RECEIVED APPLICATIONS FOR

19:28.027 --> 19:30.021
OVER 1.8 MILLION THIS YEAR.

19:30.023 --> 19:32.020
AND COPING WITH SURGES LIKE THAT

19:32.022 --> 19:33.029
WON'T BE EASY.

19:34.001 --> 19:36.001
IT COULD REQUIRE HIRING AND

19:36.003 --> 19:36.027
TRAINING DOZENS OF ADDITIONAL

19:36.029 --> 19:40.004
WORKERS TO PROCESS BALLOTS OR

19:40.006 --> 19:41.017
PURCHASING MACHINERY COSTING UP

19:41.019 --> 19:42.024
TO A MILLION DOLLARS PER UNIT.

19:42.026 --> 19:46.008
AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT,

19:46.010 --> 19:47.024
YOU NEED TO DECIDE RIGHT NOW,

19:47.026 --> 19:49.023
BECAUSE MACHINES LIKE HIGH-SPEED

19:49.025 --> 19:55.006
SCANNERS AND SORTERS CAN TAKE

19:55.008 --> 19:56.017
SEVERAL MONTHS TO ORDER AND

19:56.019 --> 19:56.024
INSTALL.

19:56.026 --> 19:57.029
ALL OF WHICH MAKES IT CONCERNING

19:58.001 --> 19:58.022
THAT SOME, LIKE MISSOURI

19:58.024 --> 19:59.011
GOVERNOR MIKE PARSON -- THE MAN

19:59.013 --> 20:00.012
YOU SAW EARLIER TELLING VOTERS

20:00.014 --> 20:02.012
TO STAY AT HOME IF THEY DIDN'T

20:02.014 --> 20:04.003
FEEL SAFE -- HAVE ARGUED THAT

20:04.005 --> 20:07.008
EVERYONE SHOULD RELAX, BECAUSE

20:07.010 --> 20:09.004
THERE'S JUST NO RUSH TO DEAL

20:09.006 --> 20:09.012
WITH THIS.

20:09.014 --> 20:10.013
>> RIGHT NOW, IT'S ABOUT

20:10.015 --> 20:12.000
REPAIRING -- BEING PREPARED FOR

20:12.002 --> 20:12.025
COVID-19, DOING WHAT WE CAN FOR

20:12.027 --> 20:13.012
THAT.

20:13.014 --> 20:14.011
IT'S ABOUT GETTING THE ECONOMY

20:14.013 --> 20:15.016
STARTED BACK UP.

20:15.018 --> 20:17.000
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE MOVING BACK TO

20:17.002 --> 20:19.011
WORK.

20:19.013 --> 20:20.002
THEY'LL BE TIME TO TALK ABOUT

20:20.004 --> 20:21.001
THE ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER AND

20:21.003 --> 20:21.022
AUGUST BUT NOW'S NOT THE TIME

20:21.024 --> 20:23.001
FOR THAT.

20:23.003 --> 20:24.009
THEY'LL BE TIME FOR THAT.

20:24.011 --> 20:27.017
>> John: BUT NOW IS ABSOLUTELY

20:27.019 --> 20:30.020
THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THIS!

20:30.022 --> 20:31.017
YOU CANNOT PREPARE FOR AN

20:31.019 --> 20:33.022
ELECTION THE SAME WAY YOU UPDATE

20:33.024 --> 20:34.016
YOUR COMPUTER SOFTWARE, BY

20:34.018 --> 20:35.015
JUST PUTTING IT OFF FOR MONTHS

20:35.017 --> 20:36.017
ON END AND SECRETLY HOPING THAT

20:36.019 --> 20:37.006
MAYBE YOU'LL BE DEAD BEFORE YOU

20:37.008 --> 20:38.004
ACTUALLY HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.

20:38.006 --> 20:41.006
WE NEED TO GET THIS RIGHT NOW!

20:41.008 --> 20:42.001
AND IT DOESN'T STOP THERE --

20:42.003 --> 20:43.019
OFFICIALS SHOULD ALSO BE

20:43.021 --> 20:45.007
COMMUNICATING TO VOTERS EXACTLY

20:45.009 --> 20:46.006
HOW TO GET A MAIL-IN BALLOT,

20:46.008 --> 20:48.023
WHEN THEY NEED TO DO IT BY, AND

20:48.025 --> 20:52.023
HOW TO PROPERLY FILL IT OUT.

20:52.025 --> 20:54.007
AND THERE'S ACTUALLY ONE

20:54.009 --> 20:55.023
LAST THING THAT WE MAY NEED TO

20:55.025 --> 20:57.015
PERSONALLY PREPARE OURSELVES

20:57.017 --> 21:00.016
FOR, AND THAT'S THAT, IN

21:00.018 --> 21:01.010
NOVEMBER, IF THERE IS -- AS

21:01.012 --> 21:02.006
SEEMS LIKELY -- A

21:02.008 --> 21:03.019
SURGE IN MAIL-IN VOTING, IT MAY

21:03.021 --> 21:04.019
TAKE MUCH, MUCH LONGER FOR ALL

21:04.021 --> 21:05.022
THE BALLOTS TO BE COUNTED.

21:05.024 --> 21:06.016
IN FACT, WE MAY NOT KNOW WHO WON

21:06.018 --> 21:07.016
UNTIL A FEW DAYS AFTER ELECTION

21:07.018 --> 21:08.016
DAY -- AND IF IT DOESN'T LOOK

21:08.018 --> 21:09.029
GOOD FOR DONALD TRUMP, LOOK FOR

21:10.001 --> 21:13.018
HIM TO USE THAT TO SOW DISCORD

21:13.020 --> 21:14.002
AMONG HIS SUPPORTERS.

21:14.004 --> 21:17.010
I'M JUST KIDDING, OF COURSE,

21:17.012 --> 21:18.003
HE'LL WIN IN A LANDSLIDE AND

21:18.005 --> 21:18.021
HIS VICTORY SPEECH WILL BE

21:18.023 --> 21:19.020
TAKING A SHIT ON THE STAGE TO

21:19.022 --> 21:20.011
THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.015
THAT'S REALLY IN KEEPING WITH

21:21.017 --> 21:24.022
THE VIBE 2020 HAS SET SO FAR.

21:24.024 --> 21:26.005
BUT REGARDLESS: THERE ARE A FEW

21:26.007 --> 21:27.029
THINGS YOU CAN DO: IF YOUR STATE

21:28.001 --> 21:30.000
DOES ALLOW VOTING BY MAIL, YOU

21:30.002 --> 21:31.000
CAN REQUEST AND RETURN YOUR

21:31.002 --> 21:32.003
ABSENTEE BALLOT EARLY.

21:32.005 --> 21:33.007
THIS WILL HELP

21:33.009 --> 21:34.005
"FLATTEN THE CURVE" OF

21:34.007 --> 21:36.008
VOTE-TABULATING ON ELECTION DAY.

21:36.010 --> 21:37.023
AND AS A REMINDER, IF YOU NEED A

21:37.025 --> 21:39.015
STAMP, THESE LITTLE BEAUTIES ARE

21:39.017 --> 21:42.001
AVAILABLE FOR TWO MORE WEEKS.

21:42.003 --> 21:43.019

21:43.021 --> 21:46.001
THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP WITH

21:46.003 --> 21:47.001
BECAUSE IF THE THING THAT'S

21:47.003 --> 21:51.007
STOPPING YOU FROM VOTING BY MAIL

21:51.009 --> 21:53.002
IS NOT BEING ABLE TO GET A FUN,

21:53.004 --> 21:53.028
FREE STICKER, WE HAVE YOU

21:54.000 --> 21:54.019
COVERED THERE.

21:55.015 --> 21:56.021

21:57.018 --> 21:58.004

21:58.006 --> 21:59.028
PRINTED OUT THIS STICKER," ONE

22:00.000 --> 22:01.004
THAT SAYS "I VOTED BY MALE" WITH

AN IMAGE OF THIS HAMSTER IN A

22:02.010 --> 22:03.026

22:03.028 --> 22:05.002
WITH AN X THROUGH IT AND THE

22:05.004 --> 22:06.015
CAPTION, "I'M NOT DEAD AND I

22:06.017 --> 22:09.005
VOTED BY MAIL!," AND FINALLY, IN

22:09.007 --> 22:10.021

FEATURING THIS EMU WEARING A TOP

22:16.022 --> 22:20.001
YOU AT IVotedByMail.com.

22:20.003 --> 22:21.002
AND I WOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER

22:21.004 --> 22:21.021
IT.

22:21.023 --> 22:23.012
BECAUSE IF YOU VOTE BY MAIL, NOT

22:23.014 --> 22:25.007
ONLY WILL YOU BE EXERCISING YOUR

22:25.009 --> 22:26.009
CIVIC DUTY, YOU'LL ALSO BE

22:26.011 --> 22:28.008
MAKING TUCKER CARLSON REALLY

22:28.010 --> 22:29.014
FUCKING MAD.

23:02.007 --> 23:03.018
HAVE THAT IN ME TO MOVE IT.

23:03.020 --> 23:05.008

23:05.010 --> 23:06.027
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT

23:06.029 --> 23:07.002
IS.

YOU GUYS TO COME INTO MY HOME.

24:13.027 --> 24:14.022
FINALLY, TONIGHT, A QUICK WORD

24:14.024 --> 24:15.019
ABOUT THE UFC, THE BEST PLACE TO

24:15.021 --> 24:16.025
WATCH GROWN ADULTS FIGHT EACH

24:16.027 --> 24:17.015
OTHER IN AN ENCLOSED SPACE,

24:17.017 --> 24:18.022
OTHER THAN AT THANKSGIVING.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.023
YOU MAY REMEMBER ON OUR LAST

24:19.025 --> 24:21.002
EPISODE, WE COVERED HOW THE

24:21.004 --> 24:22.017
WORLD OF SPORTS IS REACTING TO

24:22.019 --> 24:24.004
THE CORONAVIRUS, AND MENTIONED

24:24.006 --> 24:25.022
THAT THE UFC'S PRESIDENT,

24:25.024 --> 24:27.008
DANA WHITE, WAS PLANNING TO

24:27.010 --> 24:28.025
STAGE FIGHTS ON A PRIVATE ISLAND

24:28.027 --> 24:29.028
TO SKIRT TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS

24:30.000 --> 24:30.008
INTO THE U.S.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.009
AND IT WASN'T JUST THE IDEA THAT

24:31.011 --> 24:32.004
WE FOUND RIDICULOUS, IT WAS THE

24:32.006 --> 24:34.023
NAME THEY CHOSE FOR IT.

24:34.025 --> 24:36.025
>> John: THE UFC IS APPARENTLY

24:36.027 --> 24:37.014
BUILDING A FACILITY ON A PRIVATE

24:37.016 --> 24:38.001
ISLAND THAT THEY'RE CALLING

24:38.003 --> 24:39.010
"FIGHT ISLAND."

24:39.012 --> 24:40.007
NOW, IS THAT A CLEVER NAME?

24:40.009 --> 24:40.027
NO.

24:40.029 --> 24:42.007
IS IT THE PERFECT NAME?

24:42.009 --> 24:44.028
YES, BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST

24:45.000 --> 24:46.028
THOUGHT AN IDIOT WOULD HAVE IF

24:47.000 --> 24:47.028
THEY WANTED TO NAME A PRIVATE

24:48.000 --> 24:49.006
ISLAND WHERE FIGHTS HAPPEN.

24:49.008 --> 24:50.005
HE DIDN'T EVEN GO WITH THE

24:50.007 --> 24:51.012
OBVIOUS NAME FOR AN ISLAND WHERE

24:51.014 --> 24:54.010
YOU STAGE UFC FIGHTS, WHICH IS

24:54.012 --> 24:55.008
SIMPLY, "UFSEA."

24:55.010 --> 24:56.007
LOOK AT ME, DANA.

24:56.009 --> 24:57.025
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST CALL IT

24:57.027 --> 24:58.004
UFSEA?

24:58.006 --> 25:04.002
IT'S PERFECT.

25:04.004 --> 25:05.012
>> John: YEAH, AND I

25:05.014 --> 25:06.010
ABSOLUTELY STAND BY THAT.

25:06.012 --> 25:07.002
AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M NOT THE

25:07.004 --> 25:08.000
ONLY ONE WHO THINKS IT'S A

25:08.002 --> 25:08.026
BETTER NAME THAN FIGHT ISLAND.

25:08.028 --> 25:09.022
BECAUSE TWO DAYS AFTER THE SHOW

25:09.024 --> 25:10.020
AIRED, UFC FILED TRADEMARK

25:10.022 --> 25:11.017
APPLICATIONS FOR THE TERM

25:11.019 --> 25:12.016
"UFSEA."

25:12.018 --> 25:14.001
AND DANA WHITE EVEN CONFIRMED IT

25:14.003 --> 25:17.002
WASN'T A COINCIDENCE.

25:17.004 --> 25:18.025
>> SO, UH, WHAT'S HIS NAME?

25:18.027 --> 25:19.015
THE -- THE GUY THAT CAME OUT AND

25:19.017 --> 25:20.000
SAID --

25:20.002 --> 25:20.027
>> JOHN OLIVER.

25:20.029 --> 25:21.022
>> WELL, YEAH.

25:21.024 --> 25:28.006
JOHN OLIVER, YOU KNOW, CAME OUT

25:28.008 --> 25:29.013
AND DID THAT PIECE -- WITH

25:29.015 --> 25:30.012
SOME SELECTIVE FACTS -- YOU

25:30.014 --> 25:31.005
KNOW, ABOUT WHAT WE HAD DONE IN

25:31.007 --> 25:33.003
FLORIDA AND ALL THAT STUFF AND

25:33.005 --> 25:33.008
UFC.

25:33.010 --> 25:33.024
SO I TOLD MY LAWYERS AFTER

25:33.026 --> 25:35.015
THAT, I SAID, "SEE IF THE

25:35.017 --> 25:37.011
TRADEMARKS ARE THERE FOR UFSEA."

25:37.013 --> 25:38.000
SO, OBVIOUSLY DID AND OBVIOUSLY

25:38.002 --> 25:39.001
YOU GUYS KNOW ABOUT IT.

25:39.003 --> 25:40.016
DID WE GET 'EM?

25:40.018 --> 25:41.021
YEAH, I THINK WE GOT IT.

25:41.023 --> 25:45.011
THANKS, JOHN OLIVER.

25:45.013 --> 25:46.011
>> John: OKAY, FIRST: DANA WHITE

25:46.013 --> 25:47.023
INTENTIONALLY FORGETTING MY NAME

25:47.025 --> 25:50.006
IS A TRULY EXCELLENT NEG.

25:50.008 --> 25:52.000
OR IT WOULD BE, IF HE WEREN'T

25:52.002 --> 25:54.005
ONLY NUMBER 83 ON GQ'S LIST OF

25:54.007 --> 25:55.004
THE 100 MOST POWERFUL BALD MEN

25:55.006 --> 25:57.019
IN THE WORLD FROM 2013.

25:57.021 --> 25:58.021
NOW THAT IS A NEG, DANA!

25:58.023 --> 26:00.017
YOU GOT BEAT BY JASON ALEXANDER.

26:00.019 --> 26:04.025
YOU GOT COSTANZA-ED.

26:04.027 --> 26:06.007
BUT LOOK, MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY,

26:06.009 --> 26:10.002
I'M NOT F REMOTELY MAD HERE.

26:10.004 --> 26:11.001
I WANT YOU TO USE THAT NAME.

26:11.003 --> 26:12.003
IN FACT, I THINK YOU SHOULD

26:12.005 --> 26:13.009
LET US RENAME ALL YOUR EVENTS,

26:13.011 --> 26:13.028
BECAUSE FRANKLY, YOU'RE NOT VERY

26:14.000 --> 26:15.014
GOOD AT IT.

26:15.016 --> 26:16.012
TAKE UFC 249.

26:16.014 --> 26:16.028
IT'S JUST YOUR LOGO PLUS A

26:17.000 --> 26:17.022
NUMBER.

26:17.024 --> 26:20.004
WHERE'S THE PIZZAZZ THERE?

26:20.006 --> 26:21.012
HOW ABOUT THIS?

26:21.014 --> 26:22.010
UFC: KNUCKLE OPERA?

26:22.012 --> 26:23.013
OR DUST-UP AT THE BEEF FACTORY?

26:23.015 --> 26:24.020
OR LARGE HAMBOY COLLIDER?

26:24.022 --> 26:25.003
IT'S BETTER, RIGHT?

26:25.005 --> 26:25.022
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO SEE SOME

26:25.024 --> 26:27.022
HAMBOYS COLLIDE RIGHT NOW?

26:27.024 --> 26:28.022
HONESTLY, EVEN THE NAME

26:28.024 --> 26:29.015
"DANA WHITE" COULD USE A LITTLE

26:29.017 --> 26:30.020
PUNCH-UP.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.027
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THE HEAD

26:31.029 --> 26:32.026
OF THE ULTIMATE FIGHTING

26:32.028 --> 26:33.021
CHAMPIONSHIP.

26:33.023 --> 26:35.024
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE THIRD BEST

26:35.026 --> 26:37.010
REAL ESTATE AGENT IN SACRAMENTO,

26:37.012 --> 26:38.006
OR A VIDEO WHERE A WHITE WOMAN

26:38.008 --> 26:40.022
CALLS THE COPS ON A BLACK FAMILY

26:40.024 --> 26:41.028
FOR SMILING TOO HARD.

26:42.001 --> 26:46.000
SO HERE ARE SOME NAME

26:46.002 --> 26:46.025
IMPROVEMENTS FOR YOU

26:46.027 --> 26:47.024
FREE OF CHARGE:

26:47.026 --> 26:48.022
DUMPS McFIGHTMAN.

26:48.024 --> 26:49.023
LUG STEAKFACE,

26:49.025 --> 26:51.002
SPAMIEL MUSCLEMILK,

26:51.004 --> 26:52.013
SKULL BRISKET,

26:52.015 --> 26:54.011
TUMMYBUNS BIN LADEN,

26:54.013 --> 26:54.027
RUFUS T. NAMETHIEF, OR MY

26:54.029 --> 26:55.021
PERSONAL FAVORITE: DOUG.

26:55.023 --> 26:56.027
JUST DOUG.

26:56.029 --> 26:58.012
NO LAST NAME, LIKE CHER AND

26:58.014 --> 27:02.013
MADONNA.

27:02.015 --> 27:04.016
BECAUSE THAT'S THE DOUGEST DOUG

27:04.018 --> 27:07.006
I'VE EVER SEEN -- MAXIMUM

27:07.008 --> 27:08.002
DOUGNESS RIGHT THERE.

27:08.004 --> 27:09.003
THE POINT IS, I'M NOT MAD AT

27:09.005 --> 27:09.028
TUG SLABMEAT FOR STEALING OUR

27:10.000 --> 27:10.027
IDEA FOR "UF-SEA."

27:10.029 --> 27:12.016
WE MAY NOT EVEN BE THE FIRST

27:12.018 --> 27:14.003
PERSON HE'S STOLEN FROM -- HE

27:14.005 --> 27:17.019
ONLY TRADEMARKED "FIGHT ISLAND"

27:17.021 --> 27:18.006
A WEEK AFTER A TMZ REPORTER

27:18.008 --> 27:19.003
SUGGESTED TO HIM THAT HE CALL IT

27:19.005 --> 27:20.010
THAT.

27:20.012 --> 27:21.019
IN FACT, THE ONLY THING HE'S

27:21.021 --> 27:22.015
DONE HERE THAT ANNOYED ME WAS

27:22.017 --> 27:23.015
ACCUSING US OF USING

27:23.017 --> 27:24.019
"SELECTIVE FACTS."

27:24.021 --> 27:25.025
BECAUSE FACTS ARE TO ME WHAT

27:25.027 --> 27:27.024
OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS ARE TO

27:27.026 --> 27:28.017
DANA WHITE -- THEY'RE SOMETHING

27:28.019 --> 27:30.019
I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT.

27:30.021 --> 27:31.020
WHAT APPARENTLY UPSET HIM WAS

27:31.022 --> 27:33.012
THAT IN OUR PIECE, WE POINTED

27:33.014 --> 27:35.002
OUT THAT THREE PEOPLE, A UFC

27:35.004 --> 27:36.025
FIGHTER AND HIS TWO CORNERMEN,

27:36.027 --> 27:38.017
ALL TESTED POSITIVE FOR

27:38.019 --> 27:40.023
CORONAVIRUS BEFORE A RECENT

27:40.025 --> 27:43.017
EVENT, UNDERSCORING THE FACT

27:43.019 --> 27:44.027
THAT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO

27:44.029 --> 27:46.009
RETURN TO SPORTS COMPLETELY

27:46.011 --> 27:48.001
WITHOUT RISK RIGHT NOW.

27:48.003 --> 27:48.027
NOW WHITE RESPONDED ON TWITTER,

27:49.000 --> 27:49.017
SAYING "WE HAD THREE EVENTS, NOT

27:49.019 --> 27:50.024
ONE," WHICH IS IRRELEVANT, AND

27:50.026 --> 27:54.001
THOSE THREE POSITIVES CAME FROM

27:54.003 --> 27:55.006
1100 TESTS, WHICH DOES

27:55.008 --> 27:57.013
INITIALLY SEEM TO MINIMIZE IT,

27:57.015 --> 27:58.013
UNTIL YOU LEARN THAT ALL THOSE

27:58.015 --> 27:59.029
TESTS WERE ADMINISTERED TO JUST

28:00.001 --> 28:01.001
300 PEOPLE.

28:01.003 --> 28:03.007
BASICALLY, DANA WAS QUOTING

28:03.009 --> 28:05.005
A LARGER NUMBER TO MAKE THE

28:05.007 --> 28:05.028
POSITIVE RESULT LOOK LESS

28:06.000 --> 28:07.023
SIGNIFICANT, WHICH SEEMS LIKE,

28:07.025 --> 28:11.005
I DUNNO, A SELECTIVE FACT.

28:11.007 --> 28:12.018
HONESTLY, I THINK DANA WHITE'S

28:12.020 --> 28:14.003
JUST LOOKING FOR A FIGHT HERE.

28:14.005 --> 28:15.005
IN FACT, I'M ALMOST SURE HE IS,

28:15.007 --> 28:16.019
BECAUSE HE'S LITERALLY

28:16.021 --> 28:18.010
TRADEMARKED THE PHRASE

28:18.012 --> 28:18.023
"DANA WHITE LOOKIN'

28:18.025 --> 28:20.004
FOR A FIGHT."

28:20.006 --> 28:22.002
THAT'S REAL, AND -- AS WE

28:22.004 --> 28:23.014
LEARNED WHEN LOOKING UP HIS

28:23.016 --> 28:25.018
FILING FOR UFSEA -- IT'S JUST

28:25.020 --> 28:28.011
ONE OF THE MANY PHRASES HE'S

28:28.013 --> 28:29.021
TRADEMARKED IN THE PAST.

28:29.023 --> 28:31.000
THERE'S "FIGHT LIBRARY," WHICH

28:31.002 --> 28:32.010
IS EXCELLENT.

28:32.012 --> 28:33.029
"CHICKEN MONSTER," WHICH IS EVEN

28:34.001 --> 28:34.022
BETTER.

28:34.024 --> 28:36.004
AND "BADDEST MOTHERFUCKER."

28:36.006 --> 28:37.004
WHICH I ALWAYS ASSUMED WAS OWNED

28:37.006 --> 28:37.022
BY SAMUEL L. JACKSON.

28:37.024 --> 28:41.008
ALTHOUGH INTERESTINGLY, UFC'S

28:41.010 --> 28:42.006
TRADEMARK FOR THAT CITES ONLY

28:42.008 --> 28:43.008
A HANDFUL OF POTENTIAL USES,

28:43.010 --> 28:44.000
AMONG THEM "TOY FIGURES" AND

28:44.002 --> 28:45.021
"ACTION FIGURES."

28:45.023 --> 28:46.016
WHICH DOES MAKES SENSE.

28:46.018 --> 28:48.029
IT'S THE PERFECT PHRASE TO HAVE

28:49.001 --> 28:49.020
ON A CHILD'S TOY, BUT THAT DOES

28:49.022 --> 28:50.025
MAKE YOU WONDER WHETHER IT'S

28:50.027 --> 28:52.015
LEGAL TO PUT THAT PHRASE ON

28:52.017 --> 28:55.020
OTHER OBJECTS.

28:55.022 --> 28:58.006
WOULD DANA WHITE SUE YOU IF YOU

28:58.008 --> 29:00.024
PUT IT ON SOMETHING NOT COVERED

29:00.026 --> 29:01.006
BY HIS TRADEMARK?

29:01.008 --> 29:02.024
A MUG, FOR INSTANCE?

29:02.026 --> 29:03.026
WELL, I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW,

29:03.028 --> 29:04.003
WILL WE?

29:04.005 --> 29:07.006
CHEERS, DANA!

29:07.008 --> 29:08.015
CHEERS TO YOU.

29:08.017 --> 29:09.024
BUT WHEN WE STARTED LOOKING

29:09.026 --> 29:10.013
DEEPER, WE REALIZED THERE'S

29:10.015 --> 29:12.014
ACTUALLY A NUMBER OF TRADEMARKS

29:12.016 --> 29:15.009
THAT THEY APPLIED FOR, AND GOT,

29:15.011 --> 29:17.020
AND THEN LET EXPIRE, MY FAVORITE

29:17.022 --> 29:23.026
OF WHICH IS "YOU WILL SUBMIT"

29:23.028 --> 29:25.027
ON BABY BOOTIES, FANNY PACKS,

29:25.029 --> 29:26.013
AND WALKING CANES.

29:26.015 --> 29:27.014
BECAUSE NOTHING SAYS "I'M GONNA

29:27.016 --> 29:28.018
BEAT YOU INTO SUBMISSION" LIKE A

29:28.020 --> 29:29.008
BABY WITH A CANE WEARING A FANNY

29:29.010 --> 29:30.027
PACK.

29:30.029 --> 29:32.027
AND LOOK, SINCE DANA TOOK

29:32.029 --> 29:34.013
SOMETHING WE CAME UP WITH, WE'RE

29:34.015 --> 29:34.029
GOING TO RETURN THE FAVOR.

29:35.001 --> 29:35.020
BECAUSE GUESS WHO'S NOW

29:35.022 --> 29:36.008
OFFICIALLY IN THE PROCESS OF

29:36.010 --> 29:37.003
OWNING THE TRADEMARK

29:37.005 --> 29:38.001
"YOU WILL SUBMIT?"

29:38.003 --> 29:39.021
I'LL GIVE YOU A CLUE: IT'S GOT

29:39.023 --> 29:41.006
TWO THUMBS, IT'S SHELTERING IN

29:41.008 --> 29:43.007
A WHITE VOID, AND IT'S ABOUT TO

29:43.009 --> 29:44.004
SELL THIS BABY ONESIE, WHICH YOU

29:44.006 --> 29:45.025
CAN FIND AT

29:45.027 --> 29:48.005
TugSlabMeat'sBabyPalace.com.

29:48.007 --> 29:49.026
WHO'S THE BADDEST MOTHERFUCKER

29:49.028 --> 29:50.022
NOW, DANA?

29:50.024 --> 29:56.022
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

29:56.024 --> 29:59.001
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

29:59.003 --> 30:01.008
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

30:01.010 --> 30:02.023
GOOD NIGHT!

30:02.025 --> 30:03.014
BUY A ONESIE!

30:03.016 --> 30:04.016
DO IT!
