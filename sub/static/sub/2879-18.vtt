WEBVTT

00:01.807 --> 00:04.008
Look, I know you guys don't want
to do this,

00:04.010 --> 00:05.142
but we have no choice.

00:05.144 --> 00:06.511
So, you can either
bitch and whine

00:06.513 --> 00:08.012
or we can
just get it over with.

00:08.013 --> 00:08.896
I got "whine."

00:08.898 --> 00:10.565
I got the "b word."

00:10.567 --> 00:12.717
Yeah, well,
it's in our contract

00:12.719 --> 00:14.402
to serve on a
university committee.

00:14.404 --> 00:15.403
And frankly,

00:15.405 --> 00:16.654
this is one I believe in.

00:16.656 --> 00:17.989
Okay, here we go.

00:17.991 --> 00:20.891
Encouraging more women to
pursue a career in the sciences.

00:20.893 --> 00:22.326
Come on,
if I was any good

00:22.328 --> 00:23.727
at convincing women to do stuff,

00:23.729 --> 00:26.497
I wouldn't have spent so much of
my 20s in the shower.

00:28.116 --> 00:29.183
If you ask me,

00:29.185 --> 00:31.002
this whole thing is a waste of
our time.

00:31.004 --> 00:32.253
Helping women?

00:32.255 --> 00:34.905
Yeah, helping anyone.

00:34.907 --> 00:37.291
People should take care
of themselves.

00:37.293 --> 00:38.843
Oh, like yesterday,

00:38.845 --> 00:41.045
when you made me drive you
to the dry cleaners,

00:41.047 --> 00:42.913
the pharmacy
and the post office?

00:42.915 --> 00:45.683
I'm not saying people
can't use tools.

00:47.286 --> 00:50.354
Even an otter picks up a rock
when he wants a clam.

00:51.773 --> 00:52.940
You don't think it's worthwhile

00:52.942 --> 00:55.026
to try to get more women
working in science.

00:55.028 --> 00:57.194
I think
that's incredibly sexist of you.

00:57.196 --> 00:59.530
I believe in a
gender-blind society

00:59.532 --> 01:02.533
like in <i>Star Trek,</i>
where women and men

01:02.535 --> 01:06.120
of all races and creeds
work side by side as equals.

01:06.122 --> 01:08.623
You mean
where they were advanced enough

01:08.625 --> 01:10.675
to invent
an interstellar warp drive,

01:10.677 --> 01:14.078
but a black lady still answered
the space phone?

01:15.080 --> 01:16.714
Oh, I did spend a lot of my

01:16.716 --> 01:18.666
shower time
with Lieutenant Uhura.

01:20.052 --> 01:23.454
Howard's
disturbing recollections aside,

01:23.456 --> 01:25.840
I don't appreciate
being forced to do

01:25.842 --> 01:26.974
banal committee work.

01:26.976 --> 01:28.893
Yes, I know,
you're too smart for this.

01:28.895 --> 01:29.877
Exactly.

01:29.879 --> 01:31.345
It's like
asking the Human Torch

01:31.347 --> 01:34.065
to heat up your frozen burrito.

01:34.067 --> 01:35.149
Got it.

01:35.151 --> 01:37.151
All right,
I'm thinking one way

01:37.153 --> 01:39.070
to counter bias
in the peer-review process,

01:39.072 --> 01:41.522
is for papers to be submitted
under gender-neutral names.

01:41.524 --> 01:42.907
Like S. Smith

01:42.909 --> 01:44.158
instead of Samantha Smith.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.944
I suppose there is a history of
professional women

01:46.946 --> 01:49.614
using their initials,
so as not to be pre-judged.

01:49.616 --> 01:51.866
<i>Harry Potter's</i> J.K. Rowling,

01:51.868 --> 01:54.035
uh, <i>Star Trek's</i> D.C. Fontana.

01:54.037 --> 01:57.088
Van Nuys pole-dancer
D.D. Melons.

01:59.424 --> 02:01.876
All right, I think we've
really helped women today.

02:01.878 --> 02:03.427
Let's fire
up the old Xbox.

02:03.429 --> 02:05.713
Guys, please don't make this
a school project

02:05.715 --> 02:07.548
where I'm the smart kid doing
all the work

02:07.550 --> 02:09.183
while the slackers
sit back and watch.

02:09.185 --> 02:10.434
No, we're not.

02:10.436 --> 02:11.786
This time you're the smart
kid doing all the work

02:11.788 --> 02:14.639
while the even smarter kids
sit back and watch.

02:15.557 --> 02:17.608
So, you think I'm
one of the smarter kids?

02:17.610 --> 02:20.111
No, you're a tool I was
using to make my point.

02:52.826 --> 02:55.660
Guys, our topic is "Encouraging
Women in Science."

02:55.662 --> 02:58.079
Can you at least play
a less sexist game

03:02.184 --> 03:04.418
How is it sexist?

03:04.420 --> 03:08.339
My character wields a
battle axe as well as any man.

03:09.475 --> 03:11.392
Not to mention she
has mammary glands

03:11.394 --> 03:13.094
that could
nurse a family of 30.

03:14.396 --> 03:19.650
And have enough milk left over
to open a Baskin Robbins.

03:19.652 --> 03:23.488
Mother, warrior-princess,
franchise owner--

03:23.490 --> 03:26.858
I hear glass ceilings
shattering all over town.

03:26.860 --> 03:28.609
Sheldon,
you're always saying

03:28.611 --> 03:30.495
how much smarter
you are than me.

03:30.497 --> 03:32.363
Spend five seconds
and come up with one idea

03:32.365 --> 03:34.248
on how to get more women
into science.

03:36.001 --> 03:39.453
All your ideas address the issue
at a university level.

03:39.455 --> 03:40.505
By then it's too late.

03:40.507 --> 03:42.723
You need to
design an outreach program

03:42.725 --> 03:44.425
that targets girls
at the middle school level

03:44.427 --> 03:46.294
and sets them on an
academic track

03:46.296 --> 03:47.762
towards the hard sciences.

03:47.764 --> 03:49.497
That's actually good.

03:49.499 --> 03:51.883
Why didn't I
think of that?

03:51.885 --> 03:54.051
Some people are otters,
some people are rocks.

03:57.940 --> 03:59.440
I wonder if there's a way

03:59.442 --> 04:01.842
we could give the idea
a trial run.

04:01.844 --> 04:05.363
Maybe I could call my old
middle school,

04:05.365 --> 04:08.182
see if we can talk to some of
the female students.

04:08.184 --> 04:09.350
That's great--
try to set up something

04:09.352 --> 04:10.985
for the three of us
to go over there.

04:10.987 --> 04:12.203
Oh, hold on.

04:12.205 --> 04:14.005
While I'm comfortable speaking
about science,

04:14.007 --> 04:16.991
I'm not sure I know how to spark
the interest of schoolchildren.

04:16.993 --> 04:19.459
Better Google it.

04:19.462 --> 04:21.512
What exactly are you looking up?

04:21.514 --> 04:25.750
"How do I get
12-year-old girls excited."

04:25.752 --> 04:27.618
No!
No!

04:32.457 --> 04:35.142
Thanks again for letting
me crash "girls' night."

04:35.144 --> 04:36.177
Are you kidding?

04:36.179 --> 04:38.212
You brought fancy
wine and made fondue.

04:38.214 --> 04:40.598
I've slept
with guys for less.

04:45.437 --> 04:47.355
It's a joke.

04:47.357 --> 04:49.556
Based on real events.

04:49.558 --> 04:52.827
Anyway,
I was hoping I could, uh,

04:52.829 --> 04:53.945
pick your brains a little.

04:53.947 --> 04:55.663
I'm supposed to take
Lucy out Friday

04:55.665 --> 04:57.448
and I need a killer first date.

04:57.450 --> 05:00.785
Well, evolutionary biology
says that women are attracted

05:00.787 --> 05:03.254
to a man who is steady
in the face of danger,

05:03.256 --> 05:05.873
so I recommend an
unsafe environment.

05:06.925 --> 05:10.845
Seedy bar on the wrong
side of the tracks...

05:10.847 --> 05:14.248
picnic near
a lunatic asylum...

05:14.250 --> 05:17.351
a wine tasting on Skid Row.

05:18.437 --> 05:21.806
Eh, Lucy has some,
uh, social anxiety issues.

05:21.808 --> 05:23.641
Maybe we could start
with something simpler.

05:23.643 --> 05:26.060
Why don't you take
her to Disneyland?

05:26.062 --> 05:27.528
You go on Space Mountain,

05:27.530 --> 05:29.413
you're in the dark,
she's holding onto you.

05:29.415 --> 05:30.531
Yeah, but you
just have to remember,

05:30.533 --> 05:31.983
that ride is
shorter than you think

05:31.985 --> 05:33.934
and they take a
picture of you at the end,

05:33.936 --> 05:36.070
so make sure
you got your clothes back on.

05:38.407 --> 05:41.292
It's a joke.

05:41.294 --> 05:43.244
Based on real events.

05:43.246 --> 05:44.278
Mm, Disneyland?

05:44.280 --> 05:45.663
I don't know.

05:45.665 --> 05:47.748
With all the crowds and the
weird characters walking around,

05:47.750 --> 05:49.750
just reminds me
too much of India.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.587
I haven't been to Disneyland
since I was a kid.

05:53.589 --> 05:54.922
We should
definitely go one weekend.

05:54.924 --> 05:56.307
Weekends are too crowded.

05:56.309 --> 05:58.009
So, blow off work,
go on a weekday.

05:58.011 --> 05:59.644
Hooky?

05:59.646 --> 06:01.696
I've never
played hooky in my life.

06:01.698 --> 06:03.581
My mom said
that's how girls end up

06:03.583 --> 06:06.183
addicted to
reefer and jazz music.

06:07.619 --> 06:10.471
It's more like how girls end up
at a Best Western hotel

06:10.473 --> 06:12.907
with a 34-year-old guy
named Luther.

06:15.027 --> 06:16.027
Joke?

06:16.029 --> 06:18.579
I can laugh about it now.

06:21.667 --> 06:22.867
So, what do you say?

06:22.869 --> 06:24.535
This Friday we ditch work
and go to Disneyland?

06:24.537 --> 06:25.569
I'm in.

06:25.571 --> 06:27.204
Me, too.

06:27.206 --> 06:28.372
Excuse me,

06:28.374 --> 06:30.958
I thought we were trying to
solve my problem?

06:30.960 --> 06:32.510
Oh, yeah, right.

06:32.512 --> 06:33.794
Wait, what was your problem
again?

06:33.796 --> 06:37.164
I am a man
who can't talk to women,

06:37.166 --> 06:39.517
trying to figure out how to go
on a romantic date

06:39.519 --> 06:41.552
with a girl who suffers
from such crippling

06:41.554 --> 06:44.772
social anxiety she can't be
around other people.

06:44.774 --> 06:47.425
Yeah, that's a toughie.

06:48.627 --> 06:50.761
Let's think.

06:50.763 --> 06:51.929
Hmm.

06:57.135 --> 07:01.572
We doing just Disney
or California Adventure, too?

07:02.708 --> 07:04.709
It's nice
of your old school

07:04.711 --> 07:07.745
to let us try out our science
talk on some female students.

07:07.747 --> 07:08.963
Well, they're
actually pretty excited.

07:08.965 --> 07:11.148
I'm their
most famous alum.

07:11.150 --> 07:12.483
If you don't
count the serial killer

07:12.485 --> 07:14.201
who ate all
those prostitutes.

07:16.338 --> 07:17.755
This must feel
pretty good for you,

07:17.757 --> 07:20.141
coming back to your
alma mater as an astronaut.

07:20.143 --> 07:25.012
Yeah, last time I was here, I
was just a scrawny little nerd.

07:25.014 --> 07:28.715
And now
you're also an astronaut.

07:28.717 --> 07:29.900
So many memories.

07:29.902 --> 07:32.353
I mean, how many
times in these hallways

07:32.355 --> 07:36.407
was I tripped,
punched and spit on?

07:36.409 --> 07:38.559
Oh, look,
here's my old locker.

07:38.561 --> 07:41.212
I have a
masters in engineering

07:41.214 --> 07:44.749
and I still can't figure out
how Scott Kapinski

07:44.751 --> 07:46.917
got me and my briefcase
to fit in there.

07:50.622 --> 07:51.839
Hey.

07:51.841 --> 07:53.907
What?

07:53.909 --> 07:55.543
Nothing.

07:57.963 --> 08:00.214
Smart. We don't
want any problems.

08:02.434 --> 08:04.718
I can't believe I ditched work
for Disneyland.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.470
What did you
tell your boss?

08:06.472 --> 08:08.889
Oh, I was very clever,
I did it in stages.

08:08.891 --> 08:10.524
At 7:00 last night,

08:10.526 --> 08:12.276
I called about
a problem at the lab

08:12.278 --> 08:14.695
and casually mentioned
I was going out for seafood.

08:14.697 --> 08:16.147
At 9:30,

08:16.149 --> 08:19.733
I called and told him that
one of my scallops tasted weird.

08:19.735 --> 08:21.452
At 11:30, I called and said

08:21.454 --> 08:23.404
I was
throwing up like a fire hose.

08:25.073 --> 08:29.276
At 12:45, I called and made
nothing but dry heaving sounds,

08:29.278 --> 08:31.579
and now I'm
going to Disneyland.

08:33.248 --> 08:35.166
Penny, what did you say?

08:35.168 --> 08:36.467
I work at the
Cheesecake Factory,

08:36.469 --> 08:38.251
I said "bye."

08:39.721 --> 08:41.755
So, what are we
gonna do first?

08:41.756 --> 08:42.972
I don't know
about you guys,

08:42.975 --> 08:44.258
but I'm gonna make
a beeline for the place

08:44.260 --> 08:45.643
that gives you
a princess makeover.

08:45.645 --> 08:47.261
Ooh, that sounds like fun.

08:47.263 --> 08:48.762
You're
kidding, right?

08:48.764 --> 08:51.348
We're not just gonna get drunk
and go on rides?

08:51.350 --> 08:54.401
Come on, do it with us.

08:54.403 --> 08:56.187
All right, whatever.

08:56.189 --> 08:57.404
How does it work?

08:57.406 --> 08:58.639
Okay, so,
you pick your princess--

08:58.641 --> 09:00.691
Sleeping Beauty, Snow White
Cinderella--

09:00.693 --> 09:03.027
they give you
hair, makeup, the works.

09:03.029 --> 09:06.313
Guess it would be fun
to be Cinderella.

09:06.315 --> 09:07.865
Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too.
Yeah.

09:09.035 --> 09:11.085
We can't all be Cinderella.

09:14.122 --> 09:15.422
Then how do we decide?

09:15.424 --> 09:16.540
Well, it's simple.

09:16.542 --> 09:17.824
This was my idea.

09:17.826 --> 09:18.843
I'm driving.

09:18.845 --> 09:19.760
I'm Cinderella.

09:19.762 --> 09:21.328
You bitches
got a problem with that,

09:21.330 --> 09:23.347
we could stop the car right now.

09:25.000 --> 09:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:35.843 --> 09:39.680
Excuse me,
I'm meeting a girl here.

09:39.682 --> 09:40.981
It's kind of our first date.

09:40.983 --> 09:43.534
In a library?

09:43.536 --> 09:46.520
She and I
are both a little awkward

09:46.522 --> 09:49.740
in social situations,
so this seemed like a good idea.

09:49.742 --> 09:54.795
People say
I'm a little awkward, too.

09:54.797 --> 09:56.680
May I join you?

09:56.682 --> 09:59.750
No, you can't join us.

09:59.752 --> 10:01.552
Just go-go climb back up

10:01.554 --> 10:04.004
whatever beanstalk you came
down from.

10:09.394 --> 10:11.228
You can do better.

10:15.967 --> 10:18.018
Oh, we're eating here?

10:24.159 --> 10:26.076
We're having
a texting date?

10:30.498 --> 10:31.916
<i>I love that.</i>

10:35.069 --> 10:38.238
<i>As you're reading,</i>
<i>it will help to remember</i>

10:38.240 --> 10:42.293
<i>I have an adorable accent.</i>

10:44.629 --> 10:49.600
Okay,
who's ready for some science?

10:53.087 --> 10:55.255
Me, too.

10:55.257 --> 10:57.391
Okay, I am
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

10:57.393 --> 10:59.143
I am here with my friends
Dr. Cooper

10:59.145 --> 11:02.529
and real-life astronaut
Howard Wolowitz,

11:02.531 --> 11:04.148
and we are going
to show you girls

11:04.150 --> 11:07.901
how cool a job
in science can be.

11:07.903 --> 11:09.119
How cool, you ask?

11:09.121 --> 11:12.156
Well, how about
negative 273 degrees,

11:12.158 --> 11:13.240
'cause that's the temperature

11:13.242 --> 11:16.927
at which entropy reaches
its minimum value.

11:18.947 --> 11:21.832
Did I just learn something new
and have fun doing it?

11:21.834 --> 11:24.134
What?

11:26.471 --> 11:29.073
All right!

11:29.075 --> 11:31.058
So now let's bring out

11:31.060 --> 11:32.959
theoretical physicist

11:32.961 --> 11:36.347
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

11:40.769 --> 11:42.936
Hello, female children.

11:43.805 --> 11:46.874
Allow me to inspire you

11:46.876 --> 11:50.544
with a story
about a great female scientist.

11:50.546 --> 11:55.499
Polish-born, French-educated
Madame Curie.

11:55.501 --> 11:57.368
Codiscoverer of
radioactivity,

11:57.370 --> 11:59.336
she was a hero

11:59.338 --> 12:03.173
of science...
until her hair fell out;

12:03.175 --> 12:06.593
her vomit and stool became
filled with blood...

12:06.595 --> 12:08.228
and she was poisoned

12:08.230 --> 12:11.098
to death by her own discovery.

12:12.467 --> 12:14.018
With a little hard work,

12:14.020 --> 12:17.971
I see no reason why
that can't happen to any of you.

12:21.192 --> 12:22.643
Are we done?

12:22.645 --> 12:24.795
Can we go?

12:32.342 --> 12:34.542
The thing to remember is

12:34.544 --> 12:36.761
you can go to outer space, too.

12:36.763 --> 12:38.630
I mean, look at me.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.998
I went to this very school.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.718
Those desks you're sitting in,

12:43.720 --> 12:46.220
I was once superglued
to one of them.

12:49.007 --> 12:50.108
Did you go to the moon?

12:50.110 --> 12:52.193
No, but I did go

12:52.195 --> 12:55.313
to the
International Space Station.

12:55.315 --> 12:56.180
Did you fly the rocket?

12:56.182 --> 12:57.765
No,

12:57.767 --> 13:00.518
but I was in the rocket.

13:00.520 --> 13:02.186
I didn't actually...

13:02.188 --> 13:04.289
So you just flew around?
That's kind of like my uncle.

13:04.291 --> 13:05.690
He's a flight attendant.

13:10.129 --> 13:11.296
No...

13:11.298 --> 13:12.714
I'm an American hero.

13:12.716 --> 13:14.699
Your uncle
brings people nuts, okay?

13:14.701 --> 13:18.002
Boy, we are learning
a lot here, huh?

13:18.004 --> 13:20.221
Thank you, astronaut Howard.

13:21.791 --> 13:24.225
Um, I am what's called
an experimental physicist,

13:24.227 --> 13:28.146
which is super-fun,
because I get to test theories

13:28.148 --> 13:29.480
and work with lasers.

13:29.482 --> 13:30.782
Yes?

13:30.784 --> 13:32.900
How did you decide
to become a scientist?

13:32.902 --> 13:34.352
Uh, excellent question.

13:34.354 --> 13:38.222
Um, I suppose I've always been
into science, you know...

13:38.224 --> 13:40.057
My mother and father
are scientists,

13:40.059 --> 13:42.059
so I was kind of led
in that direction.

13:42.061 --> 13:44.862
Eh, pushed might be
a better way to describe it.

13:44.864 --> 13:46.614
To be honest
with you guys,

13:46.616 --> 13:47.915
when I was your age,

13:47.917 --> 13:49.784
I wanted to be a rap star.

13:51.003 --> 13:52.203
Like Snoop Dogg,

13:52.205 --> 13:54.405
but with a healthy respect
for the police.

13:56.508 --> 13:58.259
Yeah, no, sure, you laugh.

13:58.261 --> 14:00.795
Just like my mother did.

14:01.597 --> 14:04.081
After I confided,
I was derided

14:04.083 --> 14:05.667
and chided,
my moms and I collided.

14:05.669 --> 14:07.918
She said my dreams
were misguided.

14:13.225 --> 14:16.427
That's just a little freestyle.

14:19.064 --> 14:21.866
<i>My dad's a gynecologist</i>
<i>in India,</i>

14:21.868 --> 14:24.435
<i>so if you're over there</i>
<i>and need a check up,</i>

14:24.437 --> 14:27.938
<i>as he likes to say,</i>
<i>he's "at your cervix."</i>

14:32.711 --> 14:34.829
<i>That's terrible.</i>

14:34.831 --> 14:37.598
<i>Your dad should be sent</i>
<i>to the pun-itentiary.</i>

14:42.137 --> 14:44.172
<i>That's a fitting</i>

14:44.174 --> 14:45.673
<i>pun-ishment.</i>

14:50.562 --> 14:52.930
<i>I still don't know</i>
<i>what you do for a living.</i>

14:54.633 --> 14:57.235
<i>Web design.</i>

14:59.805 --> 15:02.090
<i>Anything I might have seen?</i>

15:03.525 --> 15:05.610
<i>I don't know.</i>

15:05.612 --> 15:07.712
<i>You ever look</i>
<i>at porn Web sites?</i>

15:18.474 --> 15:20.508
<i>No, never.</i>

15:20.510 --> 15:22.760
<i>What is porn?</i>

15:25.631 --> 15:27.749
<i>Sorry. Autocorrect.</i>

15:27.751 --> 15:29.767
<i>That was supposed to say</i>

15:29.769 --> 15:32.002
<i>"prom Web sites."</i>

15:35.691 --> 15:39.076
<i>Ooh, fun. I love prom.</i>

15:39.078 --> 15:40.545
<i>The romance, the gowns,</i>

15:40.547 --> 15:43.114
<i>it's like a fairy tale come</i>
<i>to life.</i>

15:51.290 --> 15:52.723
<i>Sorry. Autocorrect.</i>

15:52.725 --> 15:53.958
<i>That was supposed to say,</i>

15:53.960 --> 15:56.327
<i>"I like sports."</i>

15:59.214 --> 16:02.650
I never wanted to play
the cello.

16:03.886 --> 16:06.254
How do you meet girls
playing the cello?

16:06.256 --> 16:08.089
"Hey, you want
to come over to my house

16:08.091 --> 16:09.574
"and listen to me play
an instrument

16:09.576 --> 16:11.809
that sounds like
a suicidal bumblebee?"

16:12.978 --> 16:14.846
Quick,
pull the fire alarm.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.064
Let's get out of here.

16:17.066 --> 16:18.649
Uh, hello again.

16:18.651 --> 16:22.520
Um, yeah, I don't know
if women in general

16:22.522 --> 16:26.107
have been actively discouraged
from pursuing the sciences,

16:26.109 --> 16:31.061
but it's clear you young women
here, today, have been.

16:35.167 --> 16:38.419
While I was listening to
my colleagues waste your time,

16:38.421 --> 16:41.906
it occurred to me that it
might be much more meaningful

16:41.908 --> 16:44.208
to hear about women in science

16:44.210 --> 16:46.761
from actual women in science,

16:46.763 --> 16:49.764
and, uh, I happen to know
two brilliant examples

16:49.766 --> 16:53.050
who have agreed to speak
to you on the phone right now.

16:53.052 --> 16:56.554
Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski,
Dr. Fowler, are you there?

16:56.556 --> 16:58.689
We're here.

16:58.691 --> 17:01.309
Thank you for taking time
out of your very busy schedule

17:01.311 --> 17:04.228
to enlighten these young women.

17:04.230 --> 17:06.931
It's our pleasure.

17:10.536 --> 17:12.904
I'm Dr. Fowler, and
I'm a neuroscientist.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.105
And I'm
Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz,

17:15.107 --> 17:16.707
and I'm a microbiologist.

17:16.709 --> 17:19.292
The world of science
needs more women,

17:19.295 --> 17:22.579
but from a young age, we
girls are encouraged to care

17:22.582 --> 17:24.214
more about the way we look

17:24.217 --> 17:27.551
than about the
power of our minds.

17:29.154 --> 17:30.788
That's true.

17:30.790 --> 17:32.673
Every one of you has
the capacity

17:32.675 --> 17:34.508
to be anything you want to be.

17:34.510 --> 17:37.962
Unless you want
to be Cinderella.

17:37.964 --> 17:39.513
Come at me.

17:39.515 --> 17:41.015
See what happens.

17:44.086 --> 17:46.470
<i>This was really fun.</i>

17:48.306 --> 17:52.109
My battery's dying,
so I'm just gonna talk.

17:52.111 --> 17:54.362
Thanks for today.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.981
I've been trying to do
more things that scare me,

17:56.983 --> 17:59.984
and coming here
was definitely one of them.

18:00.786 --> 18:02.420
But it was also really nice.

18:02.422 --> 18:05.423
So thanks, and, um,

18:05.425 --> 18:06.958
I'm gonna go.

18:11.013 --> 18:14.265
Maybe I could do
one more scary thing

18:14.267 --> 18:17.668
before I go
and give you a kiss good-bye?

18:17.670 --> 18:19.186
You know,

18:19.188 --> 18:21.272
if that's okay.

18:24.476 --> 18:27.278
Okay.

18:28.814 --> 18:30.998
Panic attack!
Maybe next time.

18:35.186 --> 18:37.354
I'm counting that as foreplay.

18:46.631 --> 18:47.871
Bernie,

18:47.872 --> 18:50.022
I'm home.

18:50.024 --> 18:51.874
You have fun today?

18:51.876 --> 18:55.128
Yes, and I have a
surprise for you.

18:55.130 --> 18:58.764
Please be Cinderella.
Please be Cinderella.

18:58.766 --> 19:02.251
Well, hello, Prince Charming.

19:05.839 --> 19:08.374
Milady.

19:20.104 --> 19:23.189
Hey, how was your... what?

19:23.191 --> 19:24.774
I can explain.

19:24.776 --> 19:26.359
I played hooky with the girls,

19:26.361 --> 19:28.578
then we all went to Disneyland
and got...

19:28.580 --> 19:29.829
What are you doing?

19:29.831 --> 19:32.949
Disneyland. Go on,
I'm listening.

19:35.285 --> 19:41.007
Sheldon, all Snow White needs
is one little kiss to wake up.

19:41.009 --> 19:43.686
Heard you the first time.
