to try another card?

22:06.551 --> 22:08.551
- Uh, okay.

22:10.275 --> 22:13.206
Uh...
Just...

22:13.275 --> 22:15.103
- Yeah.

22:15.172 --> 22:17.172
- Thank you.

22:17.241 --> 22:19.034
- Shit.

22:19.103 --> 22:21.620
This is embarrassing.
I guess I'm a relic too.

22:21.689 --> 22:25.068
You write for "Vanity Fair."

22:25.137 --> 22:27.344
And "Vogue."
- Wrote.

22:27.413 --> 22:29.000
Past tense.

22:29.068 --> 22:31.413
Magazines are dying
even faster than books.

22:31.482 --> 22:35.172
This is what I write now.

22:35.241 --> 22:38.172
- "You won't believe which
of these sexy stars is trans."

22:38.241 --> 22:39.896
Is he?
- Nope.

22:39.965 --> 22:41.793
But you have to click through
19 photos and 6 ads

22:41.862 --> 22:43.620
to find that out.

22:43.689 --> 22:46.827
I'm barely pulling in
what I made in my twenties.

22:46.896 --> 22:49.172
- But you're out at A-list
parties every night.

22:49.241 --> 22:51.206
- Free food.
Open bar.

22:51.275 --> 22:53.172
Gift bags.
.

22:53.241 --> 22:55.275
Oh, God.

22:56.965 --> 23:01.034
- Well, look, none of us is
exactly who we say we are.

23:01.103 --> 23:03.034
I've been there.
I'll get dinner.

23:03.103 --> 23:06.000
- No, I can't.
It is too pathetic.

23:06.068 --> 23:07.517
There's a 20.
- Hey.

23:07.586 --> 23:10.620
- Uh, this gift card has $14.

23:10.689 --> 23:13.206
And for the tip.

23:13.275 --> 23:14.862
Solid hustle.
- Yeah.

23:14.931 --> 23:16.620
Could we go, before she
realizes that her tip

23:16.689 --> 23:19.000
is only half a latte?

23:19.068 --> 23:20.862
- No, I'm serious.
I feel bad.

23:20.931 --> 23:23.586
Okay.
- Phone, wallet, purse, go.

23:23.655 --> 23:25.172
Casual, casual,
nothing's wrong.

23:25.241 --> 23:27.172
Everything's wrong. Go.
- Okay, ah!

23:27.241 --> 23:29.586
- She's coming.
She does not look happy.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.655
It's all right.
Thank you.

23:33.724 --> 23:35.482
- Oh, God.

23:38.206 --> 23:41.551
- Okay, well, we can't end
the night like that.

23:41.620 --> 23:45.000
Let's see.
Uh...oh.

23:45.068 --> 23:47.000
There's a Cinema Society
premiere.

23:47.068 --> 23:49.862
I am, uh,
on Andrew Saffir's list.

23:49.931 --> 23:52.172
- Uh, it doesn't matter.

23:52.241 --> 23:55.517
The alcohol's top shelf
and the food's great.

23:55.586 --> 23:58.206
Are you in?

23:58.275 --> 24:00.034
- I'm in.

24:00.103 --> 24:01.758

Somebody" playing]
