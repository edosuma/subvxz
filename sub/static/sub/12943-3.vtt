NARRATOR: <i>For centuries,
life's big questions</i>

00:04.680 --> 00:07.445
<i>have challenged same of the
world's greatest minds.</i>

00:08.600 --> 00:11.729
<i>The need for love, marriage
and lifelong commitment.</i>

00:11.800 --> 00:15.885
<i>The yearning to reproduce and
the survival of the human race.</i>

00:15.960 --> 00:20.363
<i>The search for a vocation,
the desire to find happiness</i>

00:20.720 --> 00:23.087
<i>-and the inevitable end death.</i>
-(BELL TOLLS)

00:24.920 --> 00:29.130
<i>But Karl Pilkington has not given
a second thought to any of these issues.</i>

00:29.200 --> 00:31.771
This cat's cross-eyed.
I've never seen that before.

00:32.479 --> 00:35.370
NARRATOR: <i>Now he's turned 40,
he thinks it's time he did.</i>

00:35.440 --> 00:36.646
(BURPS)

00:37.040 --> 00:38.804
<i>He's travelling around the world to see</i>

00:38.880 --> 00:42.202
<i>how other people deal
with life's big questions.</i>

00:43.440 --> 00:46.330
KARL: <i>We've had the Iron Age,
the Stone Age.</i>

00:46.400 --> 00:48.004
<i>This is the Pissing-About Age.</i>

00:48.080 --> 00:50.765
NARRATOR: <i>And to see if the issues
are such a big deal, anyway.</i>

00:50.840 --> 00:52.569
KARL: just because two people
love each other

00:52.640 --> 00:55.120
and drag other people into it.
Get on with it.

00:56.040 --> 00:59.681
NARRATOR: <i>In this episode, Karl wants
to know why people have children.</i>

00:59.840 --> 01:01.285
KARL: <i>Lazy little shits at home.</i>

01:01.360 --> 01:03.647
Call Childline of you
ask them to put the kettle on.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.323
NARRATOR: <i>Whether he can have kids.</i>

01:07.920 --> 01:11.322
How much are you meant to release?
It goes up to, like, 100 ml.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.442
<i>NARRATOR:
And what it's like being a parent.</i>

01:14.640 --> 01:17.166
(BABY CRYING)

01:17.240 --> 01:18.287
Shh.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.847
NARRATOR: This is The Meaning of Life.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.491
KARL: <i>It's like,
who's the mental one here?</i>

01:22.560 --> 01:25.803
Is it me or everyone else?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.924
You've got to be a certain type
of person to be a good parent.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.764
And I don't think I'm cut out for it.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.248
You know, I'm happy with the way things
are. I think I'm scared to change.

01:40.920 --> 01:42.649
And then bring something else along.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.563
There might be people watching,
going "Oh, that's really sad,

01:44.640 --> 01:46.802
"you're missing out there,"
but, you know...

01:46.880 --> 01:49.326
Like, when people say that,
"It's life-changing..."

01:49.840 --> 01:52.002
Well, that doesn't necessarily
mean a good thing, does it?

01:52.320 --> 01:54.766
Take one of me legs off,
that'll change me life.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.607
We're not short of people,
so you don't have to worry.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.004
It's not like, "Karl, you've got to
save the human race, have a kid."

02:01.400 --> 02:03.641
There's loads of them out there,
can't move for them.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

02:24.920 --> 02:27.287
<i>RICHARD: Karl, you ready
to go to the festival?</i>

02:28.040 --> 02:31.203
Come on in. I didn't sleep much.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.161
RICHARD: How come?

02:36.120 --> 02:37.201
'Cause of this.

02:38.040 --> 02:40.486
I bought a turtle. [just bought it.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.244
RICHARD: You can't go buying turtles.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.482
I know, but it was there.
I didn't walk past a pet shop and go,

02:44.560 --> 02:45.800
"Oh, I quite fancy a turtle."

02:45.880 --> 02:47.564
It was outside a restaurant,
ready to be eaten.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.403
And I just felt a bit bad when I saw its
eyes and it was just sort of scratching

02:51.480 --> 02:54.450
in the plastic box.
And it just bothered me.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.688
RICHARD: You've got it in a bath,
you can't keep it like that!

02:56.760 --> 02:58.250
KARL: Don't be coming in, having a go.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.685
This has been going
through me head all night.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.641
I kept worrying about it, I kept hearing
noises and what have you.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.484
I was coming in here about
half one, two o'clock,

03:04.560 --> 03:06.847
checking it hadn't strangled
itself on the plug chain.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.010
I was sat there, looking at it,
thinking "Is it even breathing?"

03:10.800 --> 03:12.404
But that's what I'd be
doing with a baby.

03:12.480 --> 03:13.970
I'd be going in, poking it all night.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.400
'Cause I'd be on edge.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.482
In a way, it's evidence to me

03:18.000 --> 03:19.684
that I wouldn't be good with kids.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.167
'Cause I couldn't, sort of, be at ease.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.891
I'd be worried about it, it'd be
bothering me. "What's it doing now?"

03:26.680 --> 03:28.205
RICHARD: Have you got a name for it?

03:28.600 --> 03:29.681
Tony.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.001
Tony the turtle. just seemed
to roll off the tongue.

03:36.280 --> 03:37.520
<i>I'm annoyed with meself.</i>

03:38.320 --> 03:40.004
You shouldn't interfere,
should you, really?

03:40.120 --> 03:42.487
If I hadn't even walked down
that street, I wouldn't have seen it,

03:42.560 --> 03:43.721
and it'd be gone by now.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.201
It would have been fried, a bit of
wasabi on its head,

03:46.280 --> 03:47.441
someone would have eaten it.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.203
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm meant to do.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.567
RICHARD: You're gonna
have to sort it out later, Karl,

03:53.640 --> 03:54.880
'cause we've got to go to the festival.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.049
KARL: <i>Put the
"Don't disturb " sign an the door.</i>

03:57.160 --> 03:58.491
<i>You're not meant to have pets in here.</i>

04:14.480 --> 04:15.811
KARL: The world's gone mental.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.849
There's a bloke just on the entrance
there with a knob on his head.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.730
Just looked like a low-rent
Doctor Who character.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.811
KARL: They were queuing up,
wanting a picture taken with him.

04:25.880 --> 04:27.723
Knob on his head,
holding a sort of red knob here.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.080
People laughing and all that.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.128
New, where I grew up, there was
a bloke called Mad john.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.646
Used to get on the 261 bus and
sit at the back and get his cock out.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.848
People weren't laughing,
having pictures taken with him.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.209
He was put away for being a nutter.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.041
KARL: He'd be a star here.

04:45.520 --> 04:48.330
I don't quite get it, I don't know
what I'm meant to get from this.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.323
I don't know if I'm a miserable bastard,

04:50.760 --> 04:52.125
but everyone else is loving it.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.727
RICHARD: They're just
celebrating the gift of life.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.884
But you celebrate life
by enjoying your life.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.889
You don't have to walk around
with a cock on your head.

05:01.160 --> 05:05.051
And that bit isn't really that important
in the big scheme of things, is it?

05:05.520 --> 05:07.682
It's the bollocks that do the hard work.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.487
That's the important bit.
It's always the way, isn't it?

05:10.560 --> 05:13.166
The things that do the hard work
in life never get the credit.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.327
Everyone should be walking around

05:14.400 --> 05:15.925
with bollocks on their head,
if we're gonna do it.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.880
KARL: <i>I'm meeting a woman called Hai.</i>

05:22.480 --> 05:24.687
<i>Wants to show me what,
you know, all this is about.</i>

05:25.040 --> 05:27.361
Hai? Hiya, Hai!

05:27.440 --> 05:28.680
- Hi!
- I'm Karl, nice to see you.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.882
KARL: So what do you want then,
do you want a boy or a girl?

05:36.800 --> 05:39.167
KARL: Oh, so you want more than one?

05:39.240 --> 05:42.642
KARL: Yeah... I don't want any kids.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.563
I've just never fancied it.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.528
I don't know, we're just not bothered.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.331
We haven't tried for it, it's not like,
"Right, tonight, we're gonna go at it

05:51.400 --> 05:54.085
"hammer and tongs
and we want to create a baby."

05:55.520 --> 05:57.887
Does me head in, this. Crowds.

05:58.680 --> 05:59.761
It's funny, 'cause she wants a baby.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.649
We're pushed that close together,
she might get one.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.281
If you want kids, be at home.
Be having it away.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.601
It's not going to happen here, is it?

06:07.280 --> 06:09.044
They're carrying the knob, yeah?

06:14.080 --> 06:15.320
Yeah, it's... Fucking hell.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.087
KARL: Everyone's doing
their own thing here.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.406
Who's in charge?

06:28.800 --> 06:30.245
And how far are we going with it?

06:30.320 --> 06:32.084
RICHARD: I think it's
to the shopping mall and back.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.329
Why are we taking this to the shops?

06:37.560 --> 06:38.721
I've had enough of it.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.482
Nearly electrified meself, they've got
electric wires going over the streets,

06:42.600 --> 06:45.171
pushing it up and down.
What a way to go.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.571
Electrified by a knob.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.281
KARL: <i>Do you work at the moment, then?
like, do you have a job?</i>

07:04.160 --> 07:06.083
So would you have to stop that,
though, if you had a kid?

07:08.840 --> 07:11.605
Are you sure, though? You're gonna be
up all night, changing nappies.

07:11.680 --> 07:15.366
You can't spend money on art stuff,
you have to spend it on the baby.

07:15.880 --> 07:18.850
There will be no more holidays,
you won't be able to go out the same.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.168
<i>You can't pick what sort of
a kid you're going to have.</i>

07:22.360 --> 07:24.931
You might have a kid,
and he might be a right little shit,

07:25.000 --> 07:26.889
do you know what I mean?
He might be loads of trouble.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.850
For me, that's a gamble
that I don't want to take.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.161
KARL: <i>Yeah.</i>

07:35.880 --> 07:37.564
KARL: So what's this bit about?

07:41.240 --> 07:43.129
KARL: Hello, baby.
What are these saying?

07:43.200 --> 07:44.964
What have other people wrote down?

07:50.400 --> 07:51.811
KARL: Everybody wants a healthy baby.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.245
I mean, don't feel like you have to

08:01.320 --> 08:03.687
write one down if you
don't know what you want...

08:03.760 --> 08:04.886
Hmm...

08:04.960 --> 08:06.883
Don't do it, 'cause you're not sure,
are you?

08:13.240 --> 08:15.402
RICHARD: <i>You just talked her out
of having a kid there.</i>

08:15.560 --> 08:19.531
I don't want to talk her out of
anything, I just was getting across that

08:19.600 --> 08:21.090
it's a big decision.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.641
<i>People never really think it through.</i>

08:24.040 --> 08:26.168
They wish for things, and think,
"Yeah, that's the answer,"

08:26.360 --> 08:27.725
when they don't really know.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.165
<i>"Am I wish I had a baby.</i> ”

08:29.240 --> 08:32.448
Well, I tell you what, if you wish you
have a baby, and you have a baby,

08:32.520 --> 08:35.922
and it's keeping you up all night,
you'll be wishing again at about

08:36.039 --> 08:38.121
3:00 a.m. in the morning,
you'll be wishing it goes to sleep.

08:38.200 --> 08:41.921
"I wish it'd stop crying."
"I wish it'd stop shitting on the sofa."

08:42.080 --> 08:43.844
You'll do a lot more wishing
once you've had a baby.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.127
KARL: Good one. That's a good answer.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.328
- That's the best one in here, that.
-HA[: Uh-huh.

09:05.840 --> 09:06.921
RICHARD: How's Tony?

09:07.560 --> 09:10.450
KARL: Yeah, he's all right. Quiet.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.004
They piss through the mouth.
That's what it says here.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.363
RICHARD: Anything about
how you look after them?

09:19.880 --> 09:21.325
It's more about how to cook 'em.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.726
Make you wonder, doesn't it?
They way they eat shit here.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.884
Did a meteorite wipe out
the dinosaurs, or what?

09:29.680 --> 09:32.206
Or these lot here, chewing down on them.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.931
I shouldn't have got involved.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.964
I do wonder if the amount of people that
have kids have them by accident,

09:41.360 --> 09:44.250
and they're just suddenly in your life,
and that's like this.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.324
I didn't think it would be
that much of a headache.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.368
<i>I called the aquariums,
they're not interested.</i>

09:50.840 --> 09:53.491
<i>I called the conservation thing,
they're not bothered,</i>

09:53.560 --> 09:54.686
<i>'cause they're not endangered.</i>

09:56.600 --> 09:58.409
<i>RICHARD: Are you sure
we should be doing this?</i>

09:58.640 --> 09:59.971
KARL: <i>Well, what are the other options?</i>

10:00.320 --> 10:01.367
We could take it back
to the restaurant...

10:01.440 --> 10:03.329
No, no, I'm not taking it back.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.486
We've gone through too
much now to turn round.

10:07.520 --> 10:08.760
We'll set him free.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.970
I've spent enough time trying
to find somewhere for it.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.090
I think this is pretty good.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.926
Fresh water, shaley, which is
what it said on the Internet.

10:27.880 --> 10:31.327
Oh, fuck... Don't let him bite me now,
after everything I've been through.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.644
Come on. You've got to get out.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.521
It's fresh water, so he
should be quite happy.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.048
There you are! Look at that,
he's loving it, isn't he?

10:43.480 --> 10:44.561
Look at that, that's
what they're meant to do,

10:44.640 --> 10:46.130
they're meant to sort of go under.

10:48.360 --> 10:49.646
It's well happy.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.325
I hope it's happy, anyway.

10:52.440 --> 10:55.205
Probably thinking, "Twelve hours ago,
[was in a three-star hotel."

10:57.280 --> 10:59.408
That is the fastest it's
moved, isn't it?

11:27.760 --> 11:31.048
KARL: <i>ifs sort of funny that everyone's
asking, "Are you having kids?</i>

11:31.160 --> 11:33.527
<i>"Oh, you're missing out," and all the
rest of it. I might not be able to.</i>

11:34.440 --> 11:37.364
I don't know what condition
me sperm is in.

11:37.880 --> 11:41.202
No idea. So that's
what I'm gonna do today.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.130
<i>Get me sperm checked out.</i>

11:44.000 --> 11:45.286
<i>See what state it's in.</i>

11:45.640 --> 11:48.371
I might have shit sperm,
can't have a kid.

11:48.680 --> 11:52.480
Or maybe that's good,
maybe it just puts a line under it.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.530
So when people say, "You're not
having kids?" I can say, "Ah, I can't."

36:16.480 --> 36:17.641
They know what they're doing.

36:19.280 --> 36:20.566
They live here.
They know what they're doing.

36:20.640 --> 36:21.971
I don't know what I'm doing.

36:22.040 --> 36:23.530
- They're only eight!
- I'm a guest.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.881
If they get tired, I'll take over,
but they're fine with it.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.523
I'll just watch. Best way to learn.

36:29.760 --> 36:30.761
Just watch and observe.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.607
<i>He's get one already!
That was quick, wasn't it?</i>

36:43.600 --> 36:44.681
<i>Did he bring that with him?</i>

36:46.400 --> 36:47.526
<i>It's good, that.</i>

36:49.240 --> 36:50.321
<i>RICHARD: You 're not getting involved?</i>

36:51.160 --> 36:52.924
KARL: <i>I'm happier here,
just looking after the boat.</i>

36:53.200 --> 36:54.281
<i>That's my little job.</i>

36:55.640 --> 36:56.766
<i>Keeping an eye on things.</i>

36:57.200 --> 36:58.247
They've chucked a few in here.

36:58.360 --> 37:00.283
Just keeping an eye on these,
so they don't escape.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.281
<i>For some reason, at home,</i>

37:03.360 --> 37:06.011
<i>everyone thinks you're bad
if you give a kid a job to do.</i>

37:06.680 --> 37:09.251
They call Childline of you ask them
to put the kettle on.

37:09.800 --> 37:10.926
Can't get them to do anything.

37:11.920 --> 37:13.081
<i>Lazy little shits at home.</i>

37:13.720 --> 37:15.927
<i>If they helped out
around the house and everything,</i>

37:16.000 --> 37:17.570
<i>at least there's
a reason to having them.</i>

37:18.080 --> 37:21.050
You're paying for them. You've got to
buy them clothes, give them food.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.361
What do they give back?

37:24.120 --> 37:26.168
At least these,
they're helping them get the food.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.326
<i>Only eight.</i>

37:29.520 --> 37:33.002
<i>If! had kids and I could use them like
this, get them out working, helping out,</i>

37:33.800 --> 37:36.007
<i>honestly, Pd consider it.</i>

37:39.080 --> 37:40.127
Have they come up for air since?

37:44.480 --> 37:45.561
Hello?

37:56.760 --> 37:59.570
KARL: <i>I mean, it was all right with the
Sea Gypsies, but you know,</i>

38:00.000 --> 38:01.081
<i>it was a lot of kids, wasn't it?</i>

38:02.160 --> 38:03.286
Glad to get away.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.448
RICHARD: <i>I thought that
might've changed your mind.</i>

38:06.520 --> 38:07.521
KARL: <i>You're having a laugh, are you?</i>

38:07.960 --> 38:11.282
Well, I'll tell you what confirmed,
to me, that I didn't want a kid.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.884
It was in Bali, the babysitting.

38:14.440 --> 38:15.487
That was it.

38:15.880 --> 38:19.407
That hour I had with that baby,
that was it.

38:20.480 --> 38:22.209
But out of that came an idea.

38:22.800 --> 38:26.282
When you think of how major it is
to make a decision to have a kid,

38:26.400 --> 38:29.165
and yet a lot of people go into it
totally blind.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.362
They've never even had a baby stop over.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.962
But no one's ever sort of
thought about just

38:34.040 --> 38:36.168
letting you have
a trial period with a kid.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.044
And that's why we're in LA.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.404
It's full of actors and that, isn't it?

38:41.120 --> 38:42.201
So that's me idea.

38:42.880 --> 38:46.407
Using actors to act as kids.

38:59.720 --> 39:01.131
Joe? How are you doing?

39:01.200 --> 39:02.247
Hey. Hi.

39:02.320 --> 39:03.810
- Good to see you.
- Hi! How are you doing?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.570
KARL: You know the Little job
I've got for you?

39:05.640 --> 39:06.801
JOE: Yes, sir. Yes sir.
DAVE: Yes. Yes.

39:06.880 --> 39:10.407
KARL: Going to a couple's house, and you
just got to basically act

39:10.520 --> 39:12.841
like, sort of, five-, six-year-olds.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.485
- Don't go over the top.
- DAVE: Right.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.965
- Don't wreck the place.
- DAVE: Right.

39:16.240 --> 39:19.562
But you've got kids yourselves,
so just imagine what your kids did

39:19.640 --> 39:21.369
-when they were that age.
- Yeah.

39:21.720 --> 39:23.643
<i>We. Right.
KARL'. Sammy's going to be your dad,</i>

39:23.800 --> 39:25.643
<i>and Megan will be your mother
for the night.</i>

39:25.720 --> 39:26.767
<i>DAVE: Sounds good.</i>

39:26.840 --> 39:28.490
KARL: <i>I want them to sort of
experience it properly.</i>

39:28.560 --> 39:29.607
<i>we. Right.</i>

39:29.680 --> 39:31.011
<i>“Rt. And by the end, they can
make their minds up</i>

39:31.080 --> 39:32.650
<i>whether they want a kid or not.</i>

39:33.080 --> 39:34.161
You see, look at that.

39:34.280 --> 39:36.681
Look out for dangerous.
They've left the door open.

39:36.760 --> 39:38.808
So you could have easily got
out there and got run over.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.007
Stupid.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.050
- This is Joe.
- Nice to meet you.

39:42.360 --> 39:44.362
And he's six.

39:44.440 --> 39:45.441
That's Dave, five.

39:46.040 --> 39:48.202
KARL: just treat them as if, you know,
they were your own.

39:48.440 --> 39:52.968
You're in charge of... You know, you've
got to remember these are five and six.

39:53.320 --> 39:56.290
So, uh, just look after them
and see how you get on.

have a fairly decent life.

all over the wall.

MEGAN: David!

40:19.680 --> 40:22.650
They knew they had kids coming.
And yet they had all the windows open.

40:23.400 --> 40:25.528
It's like they haven't even thought
about that. They can climb out.

40:25.760 --> 40:28.366
<i>It's almost like they were going to use
the window ledge as a naughty step.</i>

40:28.720 --> 40:29.881

40:30.040 --> 40:32.202
Daddy, it's so high up here.
It's fun, come on.

40:32.280 --> 40:34.442
I know, but it's dangerous,
and you can't stand there.

before one of them found</i>

I wanted them to experience.

SAMMY: Yeah, it was tiring.

I'm beat today.

It's just an extra set of hands
that you have to watch out for.

They get into everything.

42:57.640 --> 43:00.962
So, the big question is, you know,
you've had a bit of an experience,

43:01.600 --> 43:04.570
has it changed your mind in any way?

43:04.880 --> 43:06.006
- MEGAN: Yeah.
- Ha!

around 2:30 it did.

was having a bad dream.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.404

43:16.480 --> 43:17.845
MEGAN: So I think we still want them,

43:17.920 --> 43:20.730
but we're still happy just
the two of us.

43:22.080 --> 43:23.161
For right now.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.083
I don't want to have kids until I can
afford to get a nanny or a babysitter.

43:27.160 --> 43:29.242
So that way, if we have to go shopping
or something...

43:29.400 --> 43:31.289
Yeah, then it's okay.

43:31.800 --> 43:34.007
- All right, brilliant.
- Definitely a learning experience.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.970

good luck with it all.

DAVE: Yeah. I think it's a great idea.

43:51.240 --> 43:53.402
And they were talking about telling
their friends too, so I think the word

is, you know, definitely going
to get out.
