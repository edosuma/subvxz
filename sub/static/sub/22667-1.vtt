39:41.880 --> 39:44.377
Well, it's possible that
Kross knew Rachel Weller

39:44.379 --> 39:46.710
before his time at the Bureau.

39:46.712 --> 39:51.111
Possible? Find out for certain.
I wanna know who she is.

39:51.113 --> 39:53.211
If they share a past,

39:53.213 --> 39:56.077
I wanna know why they've run
off into the desert.

39:56.079 --> 39:58.378
I'm told Kross was your friend,
a good friend,

39:58.380 --> 40:01.844
as good as friends get and yet
he didn't confide in you?

40:01.846 --> 40:03.811
What are you insinuating?

40:03.813 --> 40:05.845
There are those...

40:05.847 --> 40:09.111
subversives hiding among us

40:09.113 --> 40:11.810
who would destroy
what we have left.

40:11.812 --> 40:13.778
They don't believe
this government

40:13.780 --> 40:16.677
is a democracy anymore.

40:16.679 --> 40:20.310
And whatever Kross is planning,

40:20.312 --> 40:24.810
it's your responsibility to make
sure he doesn't succeed.

40:24.812 --> 40:27.644
Those we've deemed expendable
need to believe

40:27.646 --> 40:30.378
there's a better life
waiting for them.

40:30.380 --> 40:33.377
They need hope.

40:33.379 --> 40:37.013
And we can't allow that
illusion to be destroyed.

40:48.813 --> 40:52.614
I had these brought here
so I could make a point.

40:54.646 --> 40:56.613
Huh.

41:00.245 --> 41:02.180
What is that?

41:02.879 --> 41:05.179
Is that tooth or bone?

41:06.879 --> 41:09.243
I believe that's
a child's tooth.

41:09.245 --> 41:12.746
Yeah, you're right, it is.

41:14.746 --> 41:18.044
So you take a good look
at that, Westinghouse.

41:18.046 --> 41:21.144
Now you find Kross, and
you find him quickly

41:21.146 --> 41:24.714
or you may find yourself
in New Eden as well.

41:48.145 --> 41:50.680
[flies buzzing]

42:12.412 --> 42:14.077
Is it yours?

42:14.079 --> 42:18.410
Yes... but it's yours now.

42:18.412 --> 42:21.313
I want you to have it.

42:22.145 --> 42:24.844
- For keeps?
- Yeah.

42:24.846 --> 42:27.012
Thanks.

42:29.680 --> 42:32.343
Why do you look so sad?

42:32.345 --> 42:35.647
- Have we run out of luck?
- No. We've got plenty left.

42:39.045 --> 42:40.946
Check that out.

42:43.412 --> 42:45.943
Jackfish Lake.

42:45.945 --> 42:47.876
Is that where we're going?

42:47.878 --> 42:49.880
What?

42:52.113 --> 42:55.311
Canada. That's your plan.
There are no lakes anymore.

42:55.313 --> 42:57.913
Not there or anywhere else.

43:00.245 --> 43:01.944
It looks really nice.

43:01.946 --> 43:04.212
[Noah] Lucas, let's get
back in the car.

43:06.213 --> 43:09.777
- You can't...
- Don't disappoint him.

43:09.779 --> 43:12.980
[Lucas] Next stop,
Jackfish Lake.

43:19.812 --> 43:22.781
[footsteps]

43:37.646 --> 43:40.680
Second place, national
fly fishing competition.

43:51.212 --> 43:53.146
[clatters]

43:55.213 --> 43:57.147
[can opens]

44:38.778 --> 44:40.910
It's in great shape for its age.

44:40.912 --> 44:44.711
Its age? They stopped making
vehicles 30 years ago.

44:44.713 --> 44:47.344
This is an El Camino.
The last of its kind.

44:47.346 --> 44:49.143
You won't find
anything better.

44:49.145 --> 44:51.580
Can you open the hood?

44:54.711 --> 44:56.809
It's smells, mom.

44:56.811 --> 44:59.845
Yeah, but it has four wheels,
and that's what counts.

45:02.346 --> 45:04.179
[sighs]

45:06.113 --> 45:08.147
[door closes]

45:08.878 --> 45:11.277
And if I get caught
with your vehicle?

45:11.279 --> 45:13.913
That battery alone
is worth $1000.

45:17.680 --> 45:21.011
Straight swap. Your El Camino
for the station wagon.

45:21.013 --> 45:23.143
I need some food and water.

45:23.145 --> 45:26.410
Twenty bottles of water,
and a case of baked beans.

45:26.412 --> 45:30.343
- Clean water.
- Clean enough.

45:30.345 --> 45:33.812
And I'll need that fancy watch
on your wrist.

45:36.179 --> 45:38.746
I need directions.

45:41.647 --> 45:45.110
There are no roads north,
not anymore.

45:45.112 --> 45:48.111
- You won't get across the border.
- Says who?

45:48.113 --> 45:52.180
Says those who tried and came
back. You're not the first.

45:58.711 --> 46:02.810
[sighs]
There's a man I met years ago.

46:02.812 --> 46:06.713
He might be able to help you
if he's still alive.

46:20.045 --> 46:22.212
Thank you.

46:22.846 --> 46:25.143
- Floor?
- Uh, three please.

46:25.145 --> 46:27.046
Three.

46:30.379 --> 46:33.677
Well, isn't that so very odd.

46:33.679 --> 46:36.311
The key that I found
in your bedroom

46:36.313 --> 46:40.244
fits the control panel
in this elevator.

46:40.246 --> 46:43.910
- Who are you?
- What did you give Noah Kross?

46:43.912 --> 46:47.077
I don't know that name. I don't
know what you're talking about.

46:47.079 --> 46:50.076
Listen to me, Irving Ravetch.

46:50.078 --> 46:53.909
You're a subcontractor for the
Department of National Defense.

46:53.911 --> 46:56.676
You are given very
sensitive information,

46:56.678 --> 46:59.146
and you are sworn to secrecy.

47:00.246 --> 47:02.976
This is your son.

47:02.978 --> 47:06.809
This... is your wife.

47:06.811 --> 47:08.709
Would you like to see
them again?

47:08.711 --> 47:10.277
They are not involved.

47:10.279 --> 47:14.043
What did you give him?
How much does he know?

47:14.045 --> 47:16.710
You have ten seconds to
save your family, Irving.

47:16.712 --> 47:19.744
Nine, eight, seven, six...

47:19.746 --> 47:22.144
- Project Eden.
- five, four...

47:22.146 --> 47:25.277
- I gave him Eden.
- three, two...

47:25.279 --> 47:27.280
one.

47:30.245 --> 47:33.410
Did he...

47:33.412 --> 47:36.177
come to you...

47:36.179 --> 47:38.877
for this information, Irving?

47:38.879 --> 47:41.780
All he wanted was the truth.

47:49.313 --> 47:53.144
Pick up the pictures...

47:53.146 --> 47:57.111
of your wife and son, Irving.
Do it now.

47:57.113 --> 47:59.047
[gasps]

48:07.146 --> 48:12.277
Go home, Irving, to your family.

48:12.279 --> 48:14.680
They're waiting for you.

48:38.046 --> 48:40.343
[Rachel] Hey, you wear
those shoes out,

48:40.345 --> 48:42.745
you're walking barefoot
in the snow.

48:46.145 --> 48:47.810
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

48:47.812 --> 48:50.110
[crashing]

48:50.112 --> 48:52.177
[grunts]

48:52.179 --> 48:54.779
- Damn it, where is he? He's gone.
- Lucas.

48:58.146 --> 48:59.879
[gunshot]

49:02.412 --> 49:04.143
Hey!

49:04.145 --> 49:06.713
What is your business
here, stranger?

49:28.778 --> 49:30.776
I am sorry for your
welcoming committee,

49:30.778 --> 49:32.877
but we can't be too careful.

49:32.879 --> 49:35.176
My wife was murdered by
scavengers last year,

49:35.178 --> 49:38.313
and my daughter raped.

49:40.878 --> 49:42.909
Adolf Schroder.

49:42.911 --> 49:46.076
Mm.

49:46.078 --> 49:48.776
I am German.

49:48.778 --> 49:52.676
I came here on vacation
with my parents as a boy.

49:52.678 --> 49:54.710
[chuckles]

49:54.712 --> 49:58.144
Things... did not go well.

49:58.146 --> 50:01.779
And as you can see, they
didn't get much better.

50:04.078 --> 50:06.780
It's not wise to mess
with Mother Nature.

50:08.678 --> 50:11.344
You can only spew so much
shit into the air and water

50:11.346 --> 50:13.780
before she starts
to fight back.

50:17.246 --> 50:20.409
We were told you could help us.

50:20.411 --> 50:22.677
Who told you this lie?

50:22.679 --> 50:26.977
- [Rachel] Farmer.
- I know no farmer.

50:26.979 --> 50:30.144
That's you in the picture,
isn't it?

50:30.146 --> 50:34.176
Ah, yes, I remember her now.

50:34.178 --> 50:38.744
We were very young.

50:38.746 --> 50:42.977
Her father sold us a car.
We didn't get very far in it.

50:42.979 --> 50:45.213
You can keep it.

50:51.113 --> 50:54.243
[exhales] What do you need?

50:54.245 --> 50:56.943
A way north.

50:56.945 --> 51:00.080
Across the border,
into Canada.

51:04.145 --> 51:07.777
The land of a thousand lakes.

51:07.779 --> 51:09.310
When did you last visit?

51:09.312 --> 51:12.044
When I was seven with
my mother. Why?

51:12.046 --> 51:17.643
Like the farmer,
your lakes may have changed.

51:17.645 --> 51:21.144
Then again, they may
not be there at all.

51:21.146 --> 51:24.076
But you are going to find out
when you get there.

51:24.078 --> 51:26.010
That is certain.

51:26.012 --> 51:28.779
[laughs]

51:46.678 --> 51:50.177
Yes, that is done. Yes, yes,
now. Where was I?

51:50.179 --> 51:53.310
Ah, yes. There is only
one way north.

51:53.312 --> 51:57.810
If you go, you cannot come back.

51:57.812 --> 52:01.342
Chances are highly likely
you won't make it at all.

52:01.344 --> 52:03.643
You will need this.

52:03.645 --> 52:06.211
[grunts]

52:06.213 --> 52:10.880
It's, uh, it's old,
but it still works.

52:13.845 --> 52:16.876
It measures radiation.

52:16.878 --> 52:19.612
Yeah, I-I know what it's for.

52:29.179 --> 52:31.944
What's, what's this?

52:31.946 --> 52:36.044
It's a rabbit's foot.
You know, for luck.

52:36.046 --> 52:40.080
- Not for the rabbit.
- I'm sure it was delicious.

52:43.945 --> 52:46.112
[glass shattering]

53:04.012 --> 53:06.712
[ripping]

53:11.312 --> 53:13.146
[sighs]

53:15.911 --> 53:20.310
The border is heavily fortified
from sea to sea.

53:20.312 --> 53:25.176
There is no way over, under,
or through it. Mm-hm?

53:25.178 --> 53:28.643
No one knows what's on
the other side for sure,

53:28.645 --> 53:35.077
but if you are determined, first
you must go west, then north.

53:35.079 --> 53:37.744
There will be no food or water.

53:37.746 --> 53:40.977
Do not eat the snow,
as it will make you sick.

53:40.979 --> 53:45.343
Now, anyone who approaches
you will be hostile.

53:45.345 --> 53:47.743
So don't be fooled
by false smiles.

53:47.745 --> 53:51.343
They will rape you
and the boy.

53:51.345 --> 53:55.909
You will go where
no one dares to go.

53:55.911 --> 53:59.710
Now here you will see the column
of a nuclear power station.

53:59.712 --> 54:02.144
There was a meltdown in
reactors three and four

54:02.146 --> 54:04.877
and the government tried to hush
it up, but was unsuccessful.

54:04.879 --> 54:07.243
As a result the area is
highly contaminated

54:07.245 --> 54:09.276
with radioactive isotopes.

54:09.278 --> 54:11.910
Nobody dares go near it.

54:11.912 --> 54:13.913
Oh, yes.

54:17.911 --> 54:21.910
You will need this.
Iodine tablets.

54:21.912 --> 54:24.810
The directions
are on the label.

54:24.812 --> 54:27.176
You start taking them
as soon as you see

54:27.178 --> 54:29.947
the reactor's cooling towers.

54:33.312 --> 54:35.746
Thank you.

54:48.811 --> 54:51.210
[cocks gun]

54:51.212 --> 54:53.844
Glock 18.

54:53.846 --> 54:56.713
Nine millimeter.

54:58.412 --> 55:01.776
Have you killed anyone?

55:01.778 --> 55:03.809
Not yet.

55:03.811 --> 55:06.612
But I will if I have to.

55:20.078 --> 55:22.346
[banging, dishes breaking]

55:25.879 --> 55:29.046
[clattering]

55:35.911 --> 55:38.312
Amanda Douglas.

55:40.145 --> 55:43.846
Will the real Rachel Weller
please stand up?

55:56.278 --> 55:58.844
We'll die if we head north.

55:58.846 --> 56:01.276
It's suicide.

56:01.278 --> 56:03.977
We'll die if we stay here.

56:03.979 --> 56:06.744
I'll tell them
it was all my fault.

56:06.746 --> 56:08.809
I'll tell them whatever
they want.

56:08.811 --> 56:11.110
There's no going back.

56:11.112 --> 56:13.713
What you had doesn't
exist anymore.

56:15.811 --> 56:17.910
You said New Eden
was a beginning.

56:17.912 --> 56:20.643
Forget what I said.

56:20.645 --> 56:23.310
Well, it can't be worse
than this.

56:23.312 --> 56:26.809
Well why don't you just
try and get some sleep.

56:26.811 --> 56:30.109
We've got a long journey
ahead of us.

56:30.111 --> 56:33.746
Mexican asters
don't grow anymore.

56:57.311 --> 57:00.777
Hey, Lucas, where's your
rabbit's foot?

57:00.779 --> 57:03.109
- My pocket.
- Don't lose it.

57:03.111 --> 57:05.645
I won't.

57:26.177 --> 57:29.009
I come here once a month,
Porter.

57:29.011 --> 57:32.343
Whether I want to or not.

57:32.345 --> 57:34.810
It's a time share.

57:34.812 --> 57:37.178
You would hate me if you
knew how much it cost.

57:38.411 --> 57:42.075
Um... So I ran the ration
card you gave me.

57:42.077 --> 57:43.909
And according to our records

57:43.911 --> 57:45.975
Amanda Douglas died
nine years ago.

57:45.977 --> 57:47.877
The coroner's report?

57:47.879 --> 57:50.343
Oh, uh, no sir.
It was a famine year.

57:50.345 --> 57:52.275
Mass burials were
quite common.

57:52.277 --> 57:54.243
Many deaths weren't
reported at all.

57:54.245 --> 57:56.143
Well, she's alive, Porter.
We know it.

57:56.145 --> 57:58.777
Amanda Douglas assumed the
identity of Rachel Weller,

57:58.779 --> 58:03.176
who I'm guessing is just
lying in a mass grave somewhere.

58:03.178 --> 58:06.810
Hm. But why assume the identity
of a dead woman?

58:06.812 --> 58:08.746
I don't know, Porter.

58:13.811 --> 58:16.009
You should come in for a swim.

58:16.011 --> 58:18.175
[laughs]

58:18.177 --> 58:20.309
[splashing]

58:20.311 --> 58:24.809
No sir, I'll, I'll...
Afraid I'll drown, sir.

58:24.811 --> 58:29.644
It's a very real possibility.

58:29.646 --> 58:33.242
This is a lost art, Porter.

58:33.244 --> 58:37.745
The trick is to hold your
breath before you go under.

58:42.345 --> 58:44.745
Mm.

59:09.679 --> 59:11.410
How long was I asleep?
[clears throat]

59:11.412 --> 59:13.945
A few hours.

59:15.978 --> 59:18.043
Where are we?

59:18.045 --> 59:22.209
Somewhere west of North Dakota
on what's left of the I-94.

59:22.211 --> 59:24.010
[Lucas muttering]

59:24.012 --> 59:25.946
He talks in his sleep.

59:30.212 --> 59:34.242
When he twitches like that,
it means he's dreaming.

59:34.244 --> 59:36.579
[chuckles]

59:41.910 --> 59:44.146
What was his father like?

59:47.112 --> 59:50.310
Um...

59:50.312 --> 59:53.876
he came, he stayed a week,
he left.

59:53.878 --> 59:58.709
He was some city dweller.
Lucas never knew him.

59:58.711 --> 01:00:03.210
But lately he's been
asking a lot of questions.

01:00:03.212 --> 01:00:05.808
What do you tell him?

01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:08.777
I make things up.

01:00:08.779 --> 01:00:12.342
Fill in the blanks, and...

01:00:12.344 --> 01:00:15.676
I mean he wants to hear that
he's a knight in shining armor.

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:18.011
[scoffs]

01:00:20.311 --> 01:00:25.309
What about you?
What's your story?

01:00:25.311 --> 01:00:29.142
I assume you have one.
I mean we all do.

01:00:29.144 --> 01:00:31.809
My mother died when I was 12.

01:00:31.811 --> 01:00:33.842
I was shipped off
to a state orphanage.

01:00:33.844 --> 01:00:36.010
Wasn't a very nice place.

01:00:36.012 --> 01:00:38.842
I don't remember my father.

01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:42.343
There was a man,
friend of my mother's,

01:00:42.345 --> 01:00:45.146
taught me how to fish.

01:00:54.777 --> 01:00:58.111
I wonder what the world's
gonna be like when he grows up.

01:01:00.777 --> 01:01:04.276
If he makes it that far.

01:01:04.278 --> 01:01:08.580
When I was a boy, I couldn't
wait for summer vacation.

01:01:13.145 --> 01:01:16.979
[water gurgling]

01:01:34.278 --> 01:01:36.912
[car running noisily]

01:01:43.844 --> 01:01:46.580
Lucas Weller,
six pounds, eight ounces.

01:01:49.777 --> 01:01:52.245
Hello, Rachel.

01:01:53.078 --> 01:01:55.676
Father unknown.

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:58.711
In lieu of kin, Amanda Douglas.

01:01:59.845 --> 01:02:03.644
Relationship, neighbour.

01:02:03.646 --> 01:02:07.245
Your imposter's your neighbour.
Convenient.

01:02:17.877 --> 01:02:20.679
[car running noisily]

01:02:26.711 --> 01:02:29.613
[drone whirring]

01:02:35.344 --> 01:02:38.310
[Noah] I tell you to run,
you run for your life.

01:02:38.312 --> 01:02:41.012
You run and you don't look back,
you hear me?

01:02:51.711 --> 01:02:53.210
Is it looking for us?

01:02:53.212 --> 01:02:55.943
It's military.

01:02:55.945 --> 01:02:58.209
I think it's replenishing
its solar cells.

01:02:58.211 --> 01:03:01.875
- It can stay up there for days.
- What are we gonna do?

01:03:01.877 --> 01:03:04.009
Stay put, that's all
we can do.

01:03:04.011 --> 01:03:07.377
If you know a long story, now
would be the time to tell it.

01:03:07.379 --> 01:03:10.410
[Lucas] It's circling.
It has teeth. I can see 'em.

01:03:10.412 --> 01:03:14.346
Yeah, and a 20mm mini gun capable
of firing 40 rounds per second.

01:03:17.012 --> 01:03:19.276
- I have to pee.
- Hold it.

01:03:19.278 --> 01:03:21.175
I don't think it knows
we're down here.

01:03:21.177 --> 01:03:23.211
If it did,
we'd be dead by now.

01:03:30.678 --> 01:03:32.242
What have you got?

01:03:32.244 --> 01:03:35.342
Um, sir, a military drone has
picked up some movement

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:38.843
in a sector that hasn't seen
vehicle traffic in months.

01:03:38.845 --> 01:03:40.377
There's something down there.

01:03:40.379 --> 01:03:42.709
Zoom in.

01:03:42.711 --> 01:03:45.876
Um, we can't, sir.

01:03:45.878 --> 01:03:47.909
We're borrowing the feed
from the military

01:03:47.911 --> 01:03:51.009
so we have no control over
the drone's functions.

01:03:51.011 --> 01:03:53.875
Do they not know how
important this is, Porter?

01:03:53.877 --> 01:03:56.276
I don't think they care, sir.

01:03:56.278 --> 01:03:58.711
It's Kross. He's down there
and I know it.

01:04:07.178 --> 01:04:09.109
This car smells.

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:10.909
Do you think something
died in here?

01:04:10.911 --> 01:04:12.912
[Rachel] It's possible.

01:04:21.312 --> 01:04:23.109
What's it doing?

01:04:23.111 --> 01:04:25.878
It's just making another
long lazy circle, okay?

01:04:29.878 --> 01:04:31.711
Hey, don't.

01:04:32.144 --> 01:04:34.076
Stop that, Lucas.

01:04:34.078 --> 01:04:35.676
[sighs]

01:04:35.678 --> 01:04:38.043
Um, okay.

01:04:38.045 --> 01:04:44.142
Once upon a time there was, in
a land far, far, away, a giant.

01:04:44.144 --> 01:04:47.076
And this giant...

01:04:47.078 --> 01:04:50.343
- Come on! This giant...
- It's a stupid game, Mom!

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:53.242
I'm not a little kid anymore.
I hate giants.

01:04:53.244 --> 01:04:56.642
He died of sunstroke, okay?
The only thing worse right now

01:04:56.644 --> 01:04:58.776
would be "I spy with
my little eye."

01:04:58.778 --> 01:05:01.779
I spy with my little eye
something white.

01:05:03.345 --> 01:05:06.142
Do that again and I'll break
your little arm.

01:05:06.144 --> 01:05:08.343
Lucas, put that out!

01:05:08.345 --> 01:05:11.010
You know what the braves
at the Indian camp told me?

01:05:11.012 --> 01:05:13.043
They're not real Indians, Lucas.

01:05:13.045 --> 01:05:16.409
- New Eden is a death camp.
- What?

01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:20.143
It's where millions of people
are burnt, turned into ash.

01:05:20.145 --> 01:05:23.009
That's why they promise
to write, but never do.

01:05:23.011 --> 01:05:25.042
Because they don't have
any fingers or arms.

01:05:25.044 --> 01:05:26.942
They're burnt to a crisp.

01:05:26.944 --> 01:05:29.110
Well that is a horrible
thing to say.

01:05:29.112 --> 01:05:31.409
It's true. First they force you
into a gas chamber,

01:05:31.411 --> 01:05:34.143
and then they burn you
in an oven.

01:05:34.145 --> 01:05:36.709
Happy endings only happen
in storybooks.

01:05:36.711 --> 01:05:39.744
The giants always step
on the little people.

01:05:43.644 --> 01:05:45.809
[Rachel] Noah.

01:05:45.811 --> 01:05:49.979
Noah, look at me.
Tell my son he's mistaken.

01:05:55.244 --> 01:05:58.908
- [Noah] What am I looking at?
- [female voice] New Eden.

01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:01.842
- What is this?
- Crematorium Six.

01:06:01.844 --> 01:06:03.611
Enhance.

01:06:12.412 --> 01:06:15.911
What have we done?

01:06:19.044 --> 01:06:21.312
There isn't enough food
or water.

01:06:26.978 --> 01:06:29.578
He's telling the truth.

01:06:33.144 --> 01:06:36.678
Mom, look. The drone's gone.

01:06:46.811 --> 01:06:49.376
That is a hell of
a secret to keep.

01:06:49.378 --> 01:06:52.176
Here's a pamphlet that
explains everything?

01:06:52.178 --> 01:06:54.642
- How do you sleep at night?
- I don't sleep.

01:06:54.644 --> 01:06:58.175
Why me? Why my son? Why save us?

01:06:58.177 --> 01:07:01.345
This is the Rachel Weller
I knew. Who are you?

01:07:05.145 --> 01:07:08.042
So you finally came
to look for your son.

01:07:08.044 --> 01:07:11.242
What took you so long?

01:07:11.244 --> 01:07:13.875
Is he everything you imagined?

01:07:13.877 --> 01:07:15.978
Yes.

01:07:21.078 --> 01:07:24.111
[car running noisily]

01:07:44.878 --> 01:07:46.946
Shit.

01:07:53.144 --> 01:07:56.375
[cocks gun] Don't worry, kid.
Keep your heads down.

01:07:56.377 --> 01:07:58.578
Get down, stay down.

01:07:59.811 --> 01:08:01.579
[gunfire]

01:08:03.678 --> 01:08:05.912
[crashing, glass shattering]

01:08:41.743 --> 01:08:43.808
Hey, you got your flashlight?

01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:47.242
- Yes, Mom. Okay. I gotta go.
- Be careful.

01:08:47.243 --> 01:08:50.178
[sighs]

01:09:10.144 --> 01:09:12.912
[dripping]

01:09:27.176 --> 01:09:29.211
[door squeaks]

01:09:37.277 --> 01:09:39.943
[door squeaking]

01:09:39.944 --> 01:09:42.242
Hello?

01:09:42.243 --> 01:09:45.011
[stammers] I-I said hello.

01:09:51.745 --> 01:09:54.342
You let him go in the washroom
on his own?

01:09:54.344 --> 01:09:57.274
- You think that's wise.
- It was number two.

01:09:57.276 --> 01:10:00.009
He insisted. He's not
a little kid anymore.

01:10:00.011 --> 01:10:02.976
All right, well,
she's running hot.

01:10:02.978 --> 01:10:05.945
There's gotta be some
water in those toilet tanks.

01:10:07.778 --> 01:10:10.312
I'll check on Lucas
while I'm there.

01:10:12.045 --> 01:10:15.109
[door squeaks]

01:10:15.111 --> 01:10:18.244
[tap dripping]

01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:35.208
[Adam] It's all fun and games
until someone loses an eye.

01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:37.274
[gurgling]

01:10:37.276 --> 01:10:39.808
[gasping for air]

01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:42.143
[gurgling]

01:10:42.145 --> 01:10:45.408
The world can be a very dangerous
place, my little friend.

01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:47.843
[Noah] Lucas? Lucas?

01:10:47.845 --> 01:10:49.879
[gunshot]

01:10:51.711 --> 01:10:53.144
[clattering]

01:10:54.945 --> 01:10:57.312
[rapid gunfire]

01:11:05.344 --> 01:11:07.178
Run!

01:11:09.176 --> 01:11:12.144
- We can't leave without Lucas.
- We're getting him back right now.

01:11:19.911 --> 01:11:22.278
[gunshot, car accelerates]

01:11:23.911 --> 01:11:25.975
[gunshots]

01:11:25.977 --> 01:11:28.142
Three's a crowd. The sooner
you figure that out,

01:11:28.144 --> 01:11:29.943
the better off you're gonna be.

01:11:29.945 --> 01:11:32.275
You must think you're tough,
picking on a little kid.

01:11:32.277 --> 01:11:34.844
Someone should take a picture.
You could show all your friends.

01:11:36.877 --> 01:11:39.210
You little pick pocket!
Where is it?

01:11:41.144 --> 01:11:43.579
[laughing] It looks so real.

01:11:44.144 --> 01:11:45.909
[clatters]

01:11:45.911 --> 01:11:48.042
I'll get it.

01:11:48.044 --> 01:11:50.312
Little brat.

01:11:57.710 --> 01:11:59.209
What is the plan?

01:11:59.211 --> 01:12:01.579
The plan is to get him
through the back door.

01:12:06.211 --> 01:12:09.011
- [Noah] Shit!
- [Lucas gasps]

01:12:14.811 --> 01:12:17.046
[gunshots]

01:12:23.678 --> 01:12:25.946
Oh boy, okay.

01:12:29.711 --> 01:12:31.409
Um, sir.

01:12:31.411 --> 01:12:33.376
What is it?

01:12:33.378 --> 01:12:36.045
We found this.

01:12:43.911 --> 01:12:46.309
Thank you, Porter.

01:12:46.311 --> 01:12:48.211
No problem, sir.

01:12:49.011 --> 01:12:51.742
[fire crackling]

01:12:51.744 --> 01:12:55.578
These instructions
were printed in 1951.

01:13:06.111 --> 01:13:09.975
A rem is a unit of
ionizing radiation.

01:13:09.977 --> 01:13:11.942
According to the
government of the day,

01:13:11.944 --> 01:13:15.642
exposure should not exceed
5000 millirems per year.

01:13:15.644 --> 01:13:18.744
An exposure of 600,000
millirems is fatal.

01:13:24.644 --> 01:13:29.809
You know, Rachel and I were...
we were friends.

01:13:29.811 --> 01:13:33.976
We lived up the road
from each other.

01:13:33.978 --> 01:13:39.141
Lucas was two and Rachel
wanted to sell him.

01:13:39.143 --> 01:13:42.210
She wanted to sell
her little boy.

01:13:45.276 --> 01:13:47.208
You need to understand
that people

01:13:47.210 --> 01:13:52.008
were eating their
neighbors then.

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:56.044
But, you know, Lucas was...

01:13:59.211 --> 01:14:03.779
he was just so beautiful,
I couldn't let that happen.

01:14:05.411 --> 01:14:10.643
And... we fought, and...

01:14:10.645 --> 01:14:14.579
you know, there was an accident.

01:14:26.277 --> 01:14:28.676
Lucas thinks you're his mother.

01:14:28.678 --> 01:14:31.111
I am his mother.

01:14:33.677 --> 01:14:36.842
I am his mother. I love him.
I protect him.

01:14:36.844 --> 01:14:40.178
I would, I would do
anything for him.

01:14:42.276 --> 01:14:44.676
You know, I worry
every single day

01:14:44.678 --> 01:14:47.709
what this world is
gonna do to him.

01:14:47.711 --> 01:14:49.642
But what about...

01:14:49.644 --> 01:14:52.845
[fire crackling]

01:15:01.711 --> 01:15:04.210
Are you gonna tell him
you're his father?

01:15:08.044 --> 01:15:10.142
Well, what am I gonna do?

01:15:10.144 --> 01:15:13.341
I'm gonna say I'm his dad,
but you're not his real mom.

01:15:13.343 --> 01:15:15.808
Or-or we did know each other,

01:15:15.810 --> 01:15:18.142
but we were just acting
like we didn't?

01:15:18.144 --> 01:15:20.845
You think he's ready
for the truth?

01:15:27.043 --> 01:15:29.578
[zips jacket]

01:15:34.344 --> 01:15:37.712
That lake had
better be there.

01:15:48.311 --> 01:15:50.944
[car running noisily]

01:16:05.943 --> 01:16:08.978
[car stops]

01:16:23.010 --> 01:16:26.075
[detector clicking rapidly]

01:16:26.077 --> 01:16:28.275
[Noah] 2000 millirems.
[Rachel] How bad is that?

01:16:28.277 --> 01:16:30.375
It's not good.

01:16:30.377 --> 01:16:32.342
All right, uh, go back
to the car.

01:16:32.344 --> 01:16:34.612
Make sure Lucas doesn't get out.

01:16:35.711 --> 01:16:37.679
[gate creaks]

01:16:43.378 --> 01:16:46.875
How you doing back there, champ?

01:16:46.877 --> 01:16:49.345
I'll let you know when
my hair falls out.

01:16:58.077 --> 01:17:00.907
Tell me about the lake. Tell me
how you learned to fish.

01:17:00.909 --> 01:17:03.409
You've heard it a hundred times!

01:17:03.411 --> 01:17:06.375
- I wanna hear it again.
- There's nothing left to tell.

01:17:06.377 --> 01:17:09.341
Why don't you tell me a story?

01:17:09.343 --> 01:17:11.975
I haven't done anything
worth telling.

01:17:11.977 --> 01:17:15.209
Will you teach me how to fish?

01:17:15.211 --> 01:17:17.978
Let's get there first.

01:17:26.678 --> 01:17:29.041
I have a nosebleed.

01:17:29.043 --> 01:17:31.210
Oh.

01:17:35.378 --> 01:17:37.375
Is my hair falling out?

01:17:37.377 --> 01:17:40.907
No, you look as handsome
as ever.

01:17:40.909 --> 01:17:44.875
I get nosebleeds sometimes.

01:17:44.877 --> 01:17:47.209
He'll be fine.

01:17:47.211 --> 01:17:50.345
- You promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

01:17:58.210 --> 01:18:00.278
When you're ready, sir.

01:18:01.809 --> 01:18:05.775
Kross seems to have adapted well
to life outside the city.

01:18:05.777 --> 01:18:09.174
He's running towards his past.

01:18:09.176 --> 01:18:12.842
The idea of something better.

01:18:12.844 --> 01:18:16.042
It'll lead him nowhere, sir.

01:18:16.044 --> 01:18:19.208
Perhaps.

01:18:19.210 --> 01:18:25.707
But if we all ran,
who would keep our secret?

01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:29.707
Well it's possible some
are too big to keep, sir.

01:18:29.709 --> 01:18:33.275
I agree.

01:18:33.277 --> 01:18:35.941
You can't kill 7 million people
and get away with it.

01:18:35.943 --> 01:18:38.944
Eventually you'll be found out.

01:18:42.177 --> 01:18:45.211
We're on the wrong side
of history, Porter.

01:19:00.677 --> 01:19:04.278
- Hey, the last page is missing.
- It's in my pocket.

01:19:07.277 --> 01:19:09.707
It's got my nuclear
submarine on it.

01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:12.210
As soon as I save six bucks,
I can order one.

01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:19.741
You know this is 80
years old, right?

01:19:19.743 --> 01:19:22.944
- I know.
- [laughs] Yeah. Okay.

01:19:25.411 --> 01:19:27.644
Thanks.

01:19:31.210 --> 01:19:32.808
You need some water?

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:35.278
Uh, no thanks.

01:19:40.843 --> 01:19:44.008
Two millirems. It's standard
background radiation.

01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:45.942
We can see the cooling towers.

01:19:45.944 --> 01:19:48.312
This needle should be posted
to the top of the meter.

01:19:57.277 --> 01:19:59.644
You wanna hand me that lantern?

01:20:02.244 --> 01:20:04.110
Smart.

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:16.208
[clicking slowly]

01:20:16.210 --> 01:20:18.775
It's two millirems.

01:20:18.777 --> 01:20:20.975
We're safe.

01:20:20.977 --> 01:20:23.641
Why would they say there's
radiation when there's none?

01:20:23.643 --> 01:20:26.175
Mom, why would they
scare us like that?

01:20:26.177 --> 01:20:29.409
Because it's easier to
build fear than build a wall.

01:20:29.411 --> 01:20:31.907
Let's go.

01:20:31.909 --> 01:20:34.210
[car starts]

01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:57.242
I spy with my little eye
something green.

01:20:57.244 --> 01:21:01.178
- A tree.
- I've never seen so many.

01:21:02.343 --> 01:21:05.008
Maybe we're dead and
we don't know it.

01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:07.209
Maybe the afterlife
is stuffed with trees.

01:21:07.211 --> 01:21:09.643
[Rachel laughs] Lucas!

01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:15.141
Uh, what's that
red light mean?

01:21:15.143 --> 01:21:17.042
[steam hissing]

01:21:17.044 --> 01:21:19.811
Oh, forget it. I think I know.

01:21:30.876 --> 01:21:32.875
[vehicle accelerating]

01:21:32.877 --> 01:21:35.577
[Noah] Run! Run!

01:21:37.043 --> 01:21:39.241
He thinks he's home free.

01:21:39.243 --> 01:21:41.110
[gunshots]

01:21:43.277 --> 01:21:45.245
That was close.

01:21:46.343 --> 01:21:50.009
[Lucas] Help us, please
help us. Come on, please.

01:21:50.011 --> 01:21:51.743
What.

01:21:58.643 --> 01:22:00.175
[gunshot]

01:22:00.177 --> 01:22:02.678
[Adam] I will shoot you
in the back.

01:22:07.277 --> 01:22:10.342
[Noah]
You have no jurisdiction here.

01:22:10.344 --> 01:22:13.341
You know, this place just
looks more impressive on a map.

01:22:13.343 --> 01:22:15.874
It's a nice spot.

01:22:15.876 --> 01:22:18.341
How'd you know
there's no radiation?

01:22:18.343 --> 01:22:21.742
I didn't.

01:22:21.744 --> 01:22:26.974
It takes balls, Noah. This road
leads nowhere. Never did.

01:22:26.976 --> 01:22:29.977
Shoulda known that.

01:22:33.243 --> 01:22:35.610
I will take that.

01:22:38.977 --> 01:22:40.842
All right, look.

01:22:40.844 --> 01:22:43.208
Nobody needs to know
what you've done here.

01:22:43.210 --> 01:22:45.874
Just return what you've stolen.
We'll redeem your reputation.

01:22:45.876 --> 01:22:48.644
You can start over.

01:22:55.243 --> 01:22:58.775
You know, unfortunately, I-I...

01:22:58.777 --> 01:23:00.774
I only have the one
return ticket.

01:23:00.776 --> 01:23:02.977
- [gunshot]
- Mom!

01:23:09.143 --> 01:23:13.941
You are not a hero, Noah.
And you never will be.

01:23:13.943 --> 01:23:16.974
Give me the memory card.

01:23:16.976 --> 01:23:22.075
You want the memory card,
let the boy go free.

01:23:22.077 --> 01:23:24.675
Let him go, Adam.

01:23:24.677 --> 01:23:27.308
He's a child.

01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:30.011
This isn't his fight.

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:37.707
He's not a child.
He's a monster.

01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:40.045
And I should take your eye out.

01:23:47.644 --> 01:23:49.975
All right, run.

01:23:49.977 --> 01:23:53.075
Go before I change my mind.
Give me the memory card.

01:23:53.077 --> 01:23:56.041
Go! Get outta here, go!

01:23:56.043 --> 01:23:58.710
- You come...
- Get out, run!

01:24:04.276 --> 01:24:06.075
He doesn't know
you're his father, huh?

01:24:06.077 --> 01:24:08.042
No.

01:24:08.044 --> 01:24:10.245
Probably for the better.

01:24:19.276 --> 01:24:21.910
[breathing hard]

01:24:26.143 --> 01:24:28.344
[buzzing]

01:24:35.976 --> 01:24:37.977
It's empty.

01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:41.778
It's blank! It's empty!

01:24:46.309 --> 01:24:49.041
[gunshot]

01:24:49.043 --> 01:24:52.944
[water splashing]

01:24:59.376 --> 01:25:02.577
[gunshot in distance]

01:25:12.211 --> 01:25:14.577
[panting]

01:25:16.276 --> 01:25:18.842
He told you to run.
Do you not listen?

01:25:18.844 --> 01:25:20.407
[Lucas grunting]

01:25:20.409 --> 01:25:22.975
That'll do, that'll do,
that'll do, you little monster.

01:25:22.977 --> 01:25:25.111
[gunshots]

01:25:31.844 --> 01:25:34.311
[cocks gun]

01:25:39.211 --> 01:25:42.208
Yes, I'm certain it's Kross.

01:25:42.210 --> 01:25:44.642
There's trouble.

01:25:44.644 --> 01:25:46.911
[Lucas crying] Mom.

01:25:50.010 --> 01:25:52.177
Mom.
[crying]

01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:57.178
[sniffling]

01:26:03.077 --> 01:26:05.844
You can find me.

01:26:32.777 --> 01:26:34.274
[fire crackling]

01:26:34.276 --> 01:26:38.341
Been waiting almost
a week for Noah.

01:26:38.343 --> 01:26:43.111
And that memory card he gave
Agent Westinghouse was blank.

01:26:49.209 --> 01:26:51.674
[sighs]

01:26:51.676 --> 01:26:54.711
Did Noah give you anything?

01:27:29.776 --> 01:27:34.042
New Eden is a death factory.

01:27:34.044 --> 01:27:38.808
A 20-square-acre gas chamber
containing six crematoriums.

01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:41.173
These are the faces
of the innocent,

01:27:41.175 --> 01:27:44.674
the 7 million victims of
state-sanctioned genocide.

01:27:44.676 --> 01:27:46.841
Be scared.

01:27:46.843 --> 01:27:49.240
Be very scared.

01:27:49.242 --> 01:27:52.674
You may be next.

01:27:52.676 --> 01:27:54.941
Let the revolution begin.

01:27:54.943 --> 01:27:57.877
[yelling]

01:28:11.342 --> 01:28:12.941
Where are we going?

01:28:12.943 --> 01:28:15.674
To the city. All of us.

01:28:15.676 --> 01:28:18.340
There's a revolution.
Haven't you heard?

01:28:18.342 --> 01:28:20.209
[laughs]

01:28:21.844 --> 01:28:24.711
[yelling]

01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:32.209
What the hell is going on?

01:28:36.744 --> 01:28:40.045
[rioting]

01:28:56.309 --> 01:28:58.643
Oh, shit.

01:28:59.843 --> 01:29:02.611
[gunshot]

01:29:04.109 --> 01:29:07.044
[sounds of nature]

01:29:12.209 --> 01:29:15.977
[splash]

01:29:23.410 --> 01:29:28.110
[Noah] When I was a boy, I
couldn't wait for summer vacation.
