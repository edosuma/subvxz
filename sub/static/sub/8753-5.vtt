00:11.208 --> 00:14.377
There's up to 50 dead people down in here.

00:14.379 --> 00:18.015
I wake up with my heart racing,
scared to death.

00:18.017 --> 00:21.418
That creature... I don't think it's good.

00:21.420 --> 00:24.421
For a small town, it was scandalous.

00:24.423 --> 00:28.191
He's like, "I just want to make them bleed."

00:28.193 --> 00:31.328
I don't like it at all,
and I want it to stop.

00:31.330 --> 00:33.930
What are they doing down here?

00:33.932 --> 00:36.867
This place is, like, insane.

00:38.402 --> 00:40.093
"You're mine. You can't escape."

00:40.193 --> 00:43.394
My name is Amy Allan.

00:43.396 --> 00:45.429
What's happening?

00:45.431 --> 00:46.530
I see dead people.

00:46.532 --> 00:48.966
It seems like a devil.

00:48.968 --> 00:50.701
I speak to dead people.

00:50.703 --> 00:52.336
He's pissed off.

00:52.338 --> 00:53.771
And they speak to me.

00:53.773 --> 00:55.939
I felt real fear.

00:55.941 --> 00:58.909
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.911 --> 01:00.477
I think she's being murdered.

01:00.479 --> 01:02.479
I rely on my partner.

01:02.481 --> 01:03.747
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.749 --> 01:05.783
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:05.785 --> 01:07.518
Serial killer pops in my head.

01:07.520 --> 01:11.088
And I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

01:11.090 --> 01:12.290
Nobody believes me.

01:12.292 --> 01:13.757
It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.759 --> 01:16.027
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

01:16.029 --> 01:17.761
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.763 --> 01:19.796
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.798 --> 01:20.998
Until the very end.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.866
You got problems. I got news for you.

01:22.868 --> 01:24.968
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:24.970 --> 01:27.038
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

01:27.040 --> 01:28.305
Or time to get out.

01:28.307 --> 01:31.051
This is their house, the house of the dead.

01:49.994 --> 01:52.296
I'm in the small town of Leslie, Michigan,

01:52.298 --> 01:54.398
about a half-hour outside of Lansing.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.268
Amy and I got called in
by a woman named Michelle.

01:57.270 --> 02:00.504
Now, she told me on the phone
that whatever's in the house

02:00.506 --> 02:02.606
is attacking her and her daughter.

02:05.543 --> 02:06.944
She begged me to rush over

02:06.946 --> 02:09.347
because she thinks she's
running out of time.

02:20.259 --> 02:22.293
Before Amy arrives,

02:22.295 --> 02:25.162
I do a complete sweep of the house.

02:25.164 --> 02:29.466
What's common in most homes,
like family photographs,

02:29.468 --> 02:32.369
can influence her findings.

02:32.371 --> 02:35.940
So it's important I remove them
all before she begins her walk.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.193
Oh, boy.

02:58.730 --> 03:01.432
The living people here...

03:01.434 --> 03:04.435
It feels like they're, like,
weighted, weighted down

03:04.437 --> 03:08.105
because there's too much...

03:08.107 --> 03:10.007
death here.

03:12.110 --> 03:16.247
This house is just really dark,

03:16.249 --> 03:18.615
really bad with crazy,

03:18.617 --> 03:22.553
with people acting out
and doing bad things.

03:24.156 --> 03:26.189
It's not...

03:26.191 --> 03:28.225
It's not good.

03:36.068 --> 03:37.701
Michelle, I'm glad I'm here,

03:37.703 --> 03:39.836
'cause you sounded really
concerned on the phone

03:39.838 --> 03:41.138
about what's happening.

03:41.140 --> 03:44.174
Things have been going on
in this house for years.

03:44.176 --> 03:46.109
We've seen apparitions.

03:46.111 --> 03:49.213
We hear footsteps.
Then the last couple years,

03:49.215 --> 03:52.883
it has become extremely physical.

03:52.885 --> 03:55.085
It's attacking my daughter and I,

03:55.087 --> 03:58.522
scratching us, leaving bruises.

03:58.524 --> 03:59.790
Wow.

03:59.792 --> 04:02.225
Who lives in the house, exactly?

04:02.227 --> 04:05.729
My husband, my 16-year-old daughter,

04:05.731 --> 04:07.898
and my 17-year-old son.

04:07.900 --> 04:10.768
This is your daughter that's
being affected by this stuff?

04:10.770 --> 04:12.703
Yes.

04:12.705 --> 04:16.039
As a mother, it absolutely eats at my gut.

04:16.041 --> 04:17.940
I would do anything to protect her,

04:17.942 --> 04:20.511
but if you can't see something,

04:20.512 --> 04:22.179
then how do you stop it from happening?

04:22.181 --> 04:24.582
With all this going on,
how you dealing with it?

04:24.584 --> 04:27.084
Well, we're not dealing with it well lately.

04:27.086 --> 04:30.087
As soon as we walk into the house,
it's like a switch.

04:30.089 --> 04:32.790
The mood will absolutely change.

04:32.792 --> 04:35.492
You'll go from, you know,
being in a great mood

04:35.494 --> 04:37.961
to being completely angry,

04:37.963 --> 04:40.764
and I've definitely been sick a lot

04:40.766 --> 04:43.066
since I've moved into this house.

04:43.068 --> 04:44.701
What kind of sick we talking about?

04:44.703 --> 04:47.137
My daughter and I both get
debilitating headaches,

04:47.139 --> 04:50.373
and I've had several surgeries.

04:50.375 --> 04:53.176
I've had shoulder surgery.
I've had a hysterectomy.

04:53.178 --> 04:55.813
I lost a baby in this house.

04:55.815 --> 04:58.782
Wow. I'm sorry to hear that.

04:58.784 --> 05:02.519
This house is beautiful.
I mean, why don't you just move?

05:02.521 --> 05:04.321
Somebody would buy it.

05:04.323 --> 05:05.856
I love this house.

05:05.858 --> 05:08.792
I've put my heart and soul into this house.

05:08.794 --> 05:12.229
I've been praying for, you know,
when you guys get here

05:12.231 --> 05:15.699
- that you're really able to help us.
- Okay.

05:20.538 --> 05:22.306
Someone's panicking.

05:22.308 --> 05:24.442
Um, there's a woman.

05:24.444 --> 05:28.279
Living. She has long hair, brown.

05:28.281 --> 05:32.215
She's got something wrong with her heart.

05:32.217 --> 05:34.818
It's just...

05:34.820 --> 05:37.154
a [bleep] mess, man.

05:37.156 --> 05:40.557
She's so scared.

05:42.760 --> 05:46.163
[Bleep] She can't breathe, man.

05:53.204 --> 05:55.372
Okay, so, what's going on in here?

05:55.374 --> 05:58.676
I have physically been
attacked in this room.

05:58.678 --> 06:00.211
I receive scratches.

06:00.213 --> 06:03.880
I actually have a picture
that I took last week.

06:06.851 --> 06:08.752
Wow.

06:08.754 --> 06:10.987
Do you remember scratching yourself at all?

06:10.989 --> 06:14.825
No. And it's happened in
this room several times.

06:14.827 --> 06:17.561
Geez. Amy's gonna want to see this.

06:17.563 --> 06:20.163
You mind if I hold onto
this for a little bit?

06:20.165 --> 06:21.565
- Sure.
- Okay.

06:21.567 --> 06:23.934
Now,
do you have anything else going on in here?

06:23.936 --> 06:28.205
I will hear footsteps
coming down the stairs,

06:28.207 --> 06:31.675
and shortly after, a shadow will appear

06:31.677 --> 06:34.978
walking down the stairways
over there to our basement.

06:36.047 --> 06:40.384
I would describe it like a man,
but as a black mass.

06:40.386 --> 06:41.785
I know it's taller than I am.

06:41.787 --> 06:44.788
And you're not on medication
or anything like that?

06:44.790 --> 06:46.824
No, I'm not on any medication.

06:46.826 --> 06:49.059
You drink at night before you go to bed?

06:49.061 --> 06:51.028
- No.
- Okay.

06:51.030 --> 06:54.498
I wake up with my heart racing,
like, scared to death.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.199
Okay.

07:00.405 --> 07:02.205
Whoa.

07:02.207 --> 07:04.307
What?

07:07.078 --> 07:10.981
There's a really big shadow person here,

07:10.983 --> 07:15.252
a shadow being. It doesn't even have a face.

07:15.254 --> 07:19.523
Really tall, really...

07:19.525 --> 07:20.523
big.

07:24.763 --> 07:28.198
I don't like it. I-I don't think it's good.

07:28.200 --> 07:31.134
It's, like...

07:31.136 --> 07:35.138
trying to make me follow it up the stairs.

07:40.412 --> 07:45.482
It's, like, crawling oddly down the hall.

07:47.952 --> 07:52.022
And it's climbing the ceilings
and climbing the walls.

07:52.024 --> 07:54.391
And it's like this on the ceiling.

07:54.393 --> 07:56.026
You know what I'm saying?

07:57.929 --> 07:59.863
Man, it gets...

07:59.865 --> 08:03.166
It gets bad at night. It gets bad at night.

08:05.469 --> 08:08.038
Thing, like, tortures her.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.407
No sleeping, no sleep.

08:19.417 --> 08:21.285
So, what's going on up here?

08:21.287 --> 08:24.622
I will see the shadow man

08:24.624 --> 08:27.491
roll right across my ceiling over my bed.

08:27.493 --> 08:30.927
Okay. Kind of like the shadow
guy you described downstairs?

08:30.929 --> 08:33.563
- Exactly like that.
- That's bizarre.

08:33.566 --> 08:36.332
Is anything else going on?

08:36.335 --> 08:40.236
The other thing is,
I have repeated nightmares.

08:40.239 --> 08:43.173
And when I wake up from these dreams,

08:43.174 --> 08:49.412
I will have bruises on my thighs
in the shape of fingerprints.

08:53.584 --> 08:54.852
You okay?

08:55.920 --> 08:57.087
Um...

08:57.089 --> 09:00.090
it just reminds me of the times

09:00.092 --> 09:03.827
when I was sexually assaulted as a child.

09:03.829 --> 09:05.996
I wasn't aware of that. Okay.

09:07.064 --> 09:10.033
I was attacked in a very brutal manner.

09:10.035 --> 09:13.370
I was chased around by a babysitter

09:13.372 --> 09:15.406
who would strip naked,

09:15.408 --> 09:18.075
and he would chase me around the house.

09:18.077 --> 09:21.211
And most of the time,
I would hide under the bed

09:21.213 --> 09:23.880
until he would drag me out by my ankles

09:23.882 --> 09:28.318
and physically assault me, so...

09:28.320 --> 09:32.989
I don't like it at all,
and I do want it to stop.

09:35.927 --> 09:38.862
It's like you're reliving it, I know. Okay?

09:41.233 --> 09:45.336
I told myself not to cry.

09:45.338 --> 09:47.871
It's not easy to talk about.

09:50.174 --> 09:53.076
How often did this happen
when you were younger?

09:53.078 --> 09:54.378
This happen one time?

09:54.380 --> 09:58.582
No, I was left with him
on several occasions.

09:58.584 --> 10:01.451
This guy ever get arrested for this?

10:01.453 --> 10:02.986
No, he did not.

10:02.988 --> 10:06.457
He committed suicide as a teenager.

10:06.459 --> 10:08.125
Okay. All right.

10:09.462 --> 10:11.528
I'm sorry.

10:11.530 --> 10:13.797
I know. It's gonna be all right.

10:15.367 --> 10:18.001
You'll be okay.

10:21.373 --> 10:23.940
Mm, this woman again...

10:27.011 --> 10:29.179
Something happened to her.

10:29.181 --> 10:31.949
What?

10:31.951 --> 10:36.286
I don't know. Like, she was
physically abused or something.

10:36.288 --> 10:39.322
And, like, because of that experience,

10:39.324 --> 10:41.925
like, maybe she's just opened,

10:41.927 --> 10:44.061
'cause this person has abilities.

10:51.903 --> 10:54.337
There's, like, this creepy guy.

10:54.339 --> 10:57.207
And this woman in particular...

10:57.209 --> 11:00.411
She's aware that he does bad things.

11:00.413 --> 11:02.979
Do you know when he's from?

11:04.882 --> 11:06.884
Not that long ago.

11:06.886 --> 11:11.454
He's focused on...

11:11.456 --> 11:14.224
the suicide?

11:14.226 --> 11:16.760
I think he killed himself,

11:16.762 --> 11:21.097
and I think he would like to
make others kill themselves.

11:23.901 --> 11:26.336
His endgame...

11:26.338 --> 11:27.771
is death.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.726
I was talking to your wife.

11:50.728 --> 11:52.965
What your daughter and her
are both going through,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.202
that would drive me to
want to shoot somebody.

11:55.204 --> 11:58.205
I do. I do want to shoot somebody,

11:58.207 --> 12:00.273
but there's nobody to shoot, Steve.

12:00.275 --> 12:02.275
Have you had any experiences here?

12:02.277 --> 12:04.745
Yeah. I was outside here with my son, Lucas,

12:04.747 --> 12:06.710
building him something.

12:06.810 --> 12:10.044
I put my circular saw down to my right.

12:10.046 --> 12:11.713
And Luke's eyes opened up.

12:11.715 --> 12:15.116
And at that point, I looked,
and the saw had levitated.

12:15.118 --> 12:17.152
It went through my tennis shoes

12:17.154 --> 12:20.722
and cut off my three middle toes.

12:20.724 --> 12:22.791
- You're joking.
- No, sir.

12:22.793 --> 12:24.492
You know, Dan, looking at this,

12:24.494 --> 12:27.161
I've had friends that have
hurt themselves pretty bad,

12:27.163 --> 12:29.297
and they never want to
admit they made a mistake.

12:29.299 --> 12:32.700
I'd tell you if I made a mistake.
I've looked at it a million times.

12:32.702 --> 12:34.836
I didn't place the saw down on my own foot.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.538
Is it possible you dropped it down,

12:36.540 --> 12:38.140
and it bounced off of something?

12:38.142 --> 12:39.307
No, I set it down.

12:39.309 --> 12:42.110
You set it down? Because I'm very cognizant

12:42.112 --> 12:45.380
of this place and how people
have gotten hurt here.

12:45.382 --> 12:49.551
We had the leading tile guy in
town cut his thumb off here.

12:49.553 --> 12:52.386
Numerous contractors have
been hurt while working here.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.493
This creepy guy...

13:03.366 --> 13:05.133
He's like, "I just go in the ground,

13:05.135 --> 13:07.235
and I just want to make them bleed."

13:09.938 --> 13:12.173
He's very disturbed.

13:12.175 --> 13:14.209
He creeps.

13:14.211 --> 13:17.312
He's a creeper.

13:17.314 --> 13:21.883
I see him, like,
coming up behind a living dude,

13:21.885 --> 13:24.519
and then his head is, like,
right here, you know?

13:24.521 --> 13:27.255
The dead dude's face is right here,

13:27.257 --> 13:29.991
And he turns, you know?

13:29.993 --> 13:32.294
And he's, like, whispering...

13:32.296 --> 13:34.662
you know? And...

13:34.664 --> 13:38.300
this gets inside the living dude's head.

13:38.302 --> 13:39.868
He tells him what to do.

13:39.870 --> 13:41.903
What does he tell him to do?

13:41.905 --> 13:44.106
I think kill himself, you know?

13:48.977 --> 13:52.446
Holy [bleep]

13:52.448 --> 13:54.048
What?

13:54.050 --> 13:57.485
There's probably up to 50
dead people down in here.

13:57.487 --> 14:00.988
Who the [bleep]...
you know what I'm saying?

14:00.990 --> 14:03.157
Has 50 [bleep] bad dead people

14:03.159 --> 14:06.628
in their house in the middle of nowhere?

14:08.698 --> 14:11.366
What are they doing down here?

14:13.468 --> 14:18.406
Wow. Something's wrong with
these [bleep] people, man.

14:18.408 --> 14:21.509
This place is, like, insane.

14:31.754 --> 14:33.388
So, Shayna, I was talking to Mom,

14:33.390 --> 14:35.624
and I really wanted to
sit down and talk to you,

14:35.626 --> 14:36.658
'cause she told me

14:36.660 --> 14:37.892
whatever's happening in the house

14:37.894 --> 14:39.461
is happening to her <i> and</i> you.

14:39.463 --> 14:42.029
- Mm-hmm. - So I just wanted to
hear from you what's going on.

14:42.031 --> 14:44.266
I'm being scratched and bruised.

14:44.268 --> 14:47.101
This just comes out of nowhere?

14:47.103 --> 14:48.870
Yes, I wake up with it.

14:48.872 --> 14:50.539
So, where else have you been scratched?

14:50.541 --> 14:52.239
On my face.

14:52.241 --> 14:55.476
- On your face?
- Yes, and I have a picture.

14:58.781 --> 15:01.583
Wow. There's nothing sharp in
the bed or anything like that,

15:01.585 --> 15:03.418
- like a zipper or anything, like...
- No.

15:03.420 --> 15:05.853
A pillowcase or anything
that could've done this?

15:05.855 --> 15:07.388
- No.
- Okay.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.159
Now, what else is happening to you?

15:11.161 --> 15:14.262
I see a shadow man in my room every night.

15:14.264 --> 15:17.532
He can appear close to my bed,

15:17.534 --> 15:20.368
but he's, like, this black figure,

15:20.370 --> 15:24.172
and he's, like, tall,
and he's just pitch black.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.541
He's darker than the night.

15:26.543 --> 15:28.910
So, it sounds like you're
experiencing a lot.

15:28.912 --> 15:31.278
- I mean, anything else happening?
- My door.

15:31.280 --> 15:35.183
It's either the bathroom
door or my bedroom door.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.719
I'll shut it,
and I'll lock it so I feel safer,

15:37.721 --> 15:39.788
and it will shake it and pound on it

15:39.790 --> 15:41.823
and try to get in. It'll push on it.

15:41.825 --> 15:46.427
Sometimes, I wake up at night,
and it will be happening.

15:46.429 --> 15:47.995
What do you think it is?

15:47.997 --> 15:53.335
I think it's the spirit that
shows himself as a dark man.

15:53.337 --> 15:56.671
- That's frightening stuff.
- Yeah.

15:58.674 --> 16:01.843
The shadow thing tries to get in here,
but it can't.

16:01.845 --> 16:04.412
When the door's closed, it can't get in.

16:04.414 --> 16:07.214
Door's very important.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.651
That creature...

16:09.653 --> 16:11.386
- shadow...
- It's there?

16:11.388 --> 16:13.821
Yeah, he's...

16:13.823 --> 16:17.759
This is his area.
He likes it over there by the window.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.864
There, he crumples up.

16:22.866 --> 16:26.968
Like, he gets all hunched,
and he just... He waits, He waits.

16:26.970 --> 16:32.040
Then he'll crawl out the
door and crawl down the hall,

16:32.042 --> 16:34.809
you know, and go [bleep] with people.

16:34.811 --> 16:38.580
He might be [bleep] crazy.

16:52.100 --> 16:55.269
I don't doubt Michelle's
testimony for one minute,

16:55.271 --> 16:57.705
but one thing that's nagging at me...

16:57.707 --> 17:00.542
I'm wondering if the traumatic
event in her childhood

17:00.642 --> 17:02.432
could be making her relive that nightmare

17:02.633 --> 17:04.299
night after night after night.

17:04.300 --> 17:07.402
It might not be paranormal at all.
Maybe it's psychological.

17:07.404 --> 17:09.805
I'm heading over to meet with a psychologist

17:09.807 --> 17:11.205
to see if that's possible.

17:17.414 --> 17:19.646
Dr. Sivyer, thanks for meeting me.

17:19.648 --> 17:21.016
I appreciate it.

17:21.018 --> 17:25.186
So, I have a client who was
molested as a young child,

17:25.189 --> 17:28.957
and she seems to be having
reoccurring nightmares

17:28.959 --> 17:31.492
duplicating what happened to her.

17:31.494 --> 17:33.561
- Okay.
- Is that common?

17:33.563 --> 17:38.099
Generally speaking,
on post-traumatic stress disorder,

17:38.101 --> 17:40.568
one of the things that can manifest

17:40.570 --> 17:43.338
is called flashbacks,

17:43.340 --> 17:45.507
where they're reliving the traumatic event

17:45.509 --> 17:46.608
over and over again.

17:46.610 --> 17:48.476
Okay. Now, here's the weird part.

17:48.478 --> 17:52.881
She's actually waking up with
the bruising from an attack.

17:52.883 --> 17:56.251
Individuals that suffer from
borderline personality disorder,

17:56.253 --> 18:00.488
they sometimes cut themselves
or bruise themselves.

18:00.490 --> 18:02.558
What would I, as an investigator, look for

18:02.560 --> 18:05.994
in a person to see if they're
that type of personality

18:05.996 --> 18:07.629
to do that to themselves?

18:07.631 --> 18:10.899
They have a hard time with their emotions.

18:10.901 --> 18:13.935
They like a lot of attention
directed towards them.

18:13.937 --> 18:16.371
Yeah, that doesn't describe this woman.

18:16.373 --> 18:18.807
- She's the total opposite.
- Okay.

18:18.809 --> 18:21.443
This is the weird part,
if you could help me out with this.

18:21.445 --> 18:24.512
- She has a 16-year-old daughter...
- Okay.

18:24.514 --> 18:27.082
Who's having the same type
of nightmares every night...

18:27.084 --> 18:29.384
All right... same bruising.

18:29.386 --> 18:32.454
It could be that her mom has explained

18:32.456 --> 18:35.791
these events over and over again,

18:35.793 --> 18:38.293
and they're seeing the same things.

18:38.295 --> 18:41.997
Could those dreams possibly cause bruises?

18:41.999 --> 18:45.967
There's no clinical
evidence that I'm aware of

18:45.969 --> 18:50.472
that bruising and scratches
just manifest themselves.

18:54.877 --> 19:00.148
So, I'm seeing,
like, this living woman.

19:00.150 --> 19:02.918
I feel like she feels like
she's losing her mind.

19:02.920 --> 19:05.754
I want to say it's stress,

19:05.756 --> 19:08.590
and I want to say it's due to her abilities.

19:11.794 --> 19:14.162
But it's [bleep] her body up bad.

19:14.164 --> 19:17.499
This might be what's affecting her heart.

19:17.501 --> 19:21.302
It's debilitating.
It's becoming debilitating for her.

19:24.440 --> 19:27.109
I'm confident that
Michelle and Shayna's bruises

19:27.111 --> 19:28.276
are not self-inflicted,

19:28.278 --> 19:30.145
so I need to look for an explanation

19:30.147 --> 19:31.913
of what's going on in this house.

19:31.915 --> 19:34.749
So I'm hitting the books
at the local library.

19:34.751 --> 19:37.085
Searching old property records,

19:37.087 --> 19:40.888
I find the original owner is
a man named Lafayette Peek.

19:40.890 --> 19:44.092
Turns out,
he suffered a lot during his time,

19:44.094 --> 19:47.128
losing three children
all under the age of 1.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.867
I'm heading over to meet
with a local genealogist

19:52.869 --> 19:54.169
who says those deaths

19:54.171 --> 19:56.838
were just the beginning
of the family's tragedies.

20:02.011 --> 20:03.812
Lafayette Peek and his wife, Harriet,

20:03.814 --> 20:05.547
purchased the property in the 1860s.

20:05.549 --> 20:07.749
And along with his brother, Theodore,

20:07.751 --> 20:08.984
they ran an apple orchard.

20:08.986 --> 20:11.152
And you can see their
property here at the top.

20:11.154 --> 20:14.556
The three kids dying,
I guess that's not uncommon

20:14.558 --> 20:16.958
back in those days,
but you say that was just the beginning

20:16.960 --> 20:18.960
of his problems. What'd you mean by that?

20:18.962 --> 20:21.196
In addition to Lafayette's children dying,
his brother,

20:21.198 --> 20:23.365
Theodore, and his wife, Sally,
also had five children,

20:23.367 --> 20:25.533
and they lost three of those children,
as well.

20:25.535 --> 20:28.770
He does not take this very well.

20:28.772 --> 20:30.839
He definitely had a mental
breakdown of some sort.

20:30.841 --> 20:33.641
He was wandering through the streets.

20:33.643 --> 20:37.478
He was shouting and screaming
and disturbing the neighbors.

20:37.480 --> 20:40.348
His daughter filed a
petition with the court,

20:40.350 --> 20:42.717
asking him to be declared insane

20:42.719 --> 20:43.915
and committed to the
Kalamazoo State Hospital

20:44.015 --> 20:45.081
for treatment.

20:46.839 --> 20:49.026
What happened to him? Did he get committed?

20:49.107 --> 20:51.808
He did not. So one of his
daughters petitioned the court

20:51.810 --> 20:53.943
to, in fact, have him
released into her custody.

20:53.945 --> 20:55.544
And so he went and lived with her

20:55.546 --> 20:57.613
until he died of a stroke
several years later.

20:57.615 --> 21:00.382
Well, that's kind of a sad
story for this guy...

21:00.384 --> 21:03.452
all this death around him,
and then he goes crazy.

21:03.454 --> 21:05.722
Unfortunately, that's not where it ends.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.923
I also located several other individuals

21:07.925 --> 21:10.959
related to the family,
but not necessarily by blood.

21:10.961 --> 21:13.662
They were neighbors who had
various forms of mental illness.

21:13.664 --> 21:16.159
That's odd. So it wasn't...

21:16.259 --> 21:18.454
You know mental illness can
run in families, but...

21:18.554 --> 21:20.520
It seems to have run in this neighborhood.

21:23.808 --> 21:25.175
I see this man.

21:25.177 --> 21:28.545
I think he lived here,
and I think he's mentally ill.

21:28.547 --> 21:31.148
This person feels crazy.

21:33.986 --> 21:37.087
This house...
It's caused people to go insane.

21:40.025 --> 21:42.525
Oh, I'm getting really pissed. Aah.

21:42.527 --> 21:47.364
This is a mess with the people here...

21:47.366 --> 21:49.866
big-time mess.

22:06.631 --> 22:07.819
During my research,

22:07.919 --> 22:10.086
I came across something
else that caught my eye.

22:10.088 --> 22:11.354
There was a huge legal battle

22:11.356 --> 22:13.390
over Dan and Michelle's property.

22:13.392 --> 22:15.391
And when I called a local historian,

22:15.393 --> 22:18.028
he said it involved betrayal,
death, and insanity.

22:26.303 --> 22:29.105
When I contacted you, you said there was

22:29.107 --> 22:30.606
a lot more to the story.

22:30.608 --> 22:32.342
It's quite an involved case.

22:32.344 --> 22:34.511
The property was owned
by John and Maria Stitt,

22:34.513 --> 22:38.114
and between the two of them,
they had a daughter named Rosa.

22:38.116 --> 22:40.116
Okay.

22:40.118 --> 22:43.453
Well, John was not the
most faithful of husbands.

22:43.455 --> 22:45.822
And after about 20 years of marriage,

22:45.824 --> 22:47.958
Maria had decided she had enough.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.293
And in 1887, she filed for a divorce.

22:50.295 --> 22:53.964
In that same year,
John is sued by one of his neighbors,

22:53.966 --> 22:57.567
Albert Blackmore,
for alienating his wife's affections.

22:58.603 --> 23:01.371
- So, he's going after this other guy's wife?
- He is.

23:01.373 --> 23:03.006
Okay.

23:03.008 --> 23:04.474
So, how's that work out?

23:04.476 --> 23:06.409
They settle out of court financially.

23:06.411 --> 23:09.746
And then he would marry
Elizabeth Blackmore,

23:09.748 --> 23:14.918
And she has adopted an
African-American child

23:14.920 --> 23:18.221
who's 14 years old by
the name of Etta Mecklin.

23:18.223 --> 23:20.256
And it's not much time goes by,

23:20.258 --> 23:22.258
then rumors are circulating

23:22.260 --> 23:26.329
- that John is now having
affections for Etta... - Okay.

23:26.331 --> 23:28.532
- The 14-year-old.
- This guy's a real piece of work.

23:28.534 --> 23:33.036
And then his wife,
his current wife, Elizabeth,

23:33.038 --> 23:37.107
in 1898, develops liver and breast cancer.

23:37.109 --> 23:40.310
- Okay.
- She passes away in 1902,

23:40.312 --> 23:43.380
so that leaves Etta and John in the home.

23:45.116 --> 23:50.186
John passes away within a few
weeks of his wife's death,

23:50.188 --> 23:53.623
and he's found in Etta's bed.

23:53.625 --> 23:55.425
Here's an article.

23:55.427 --> 24:00.296
The big thing is,
John willed most of his estate to Etta.

24:01.799 --> 24:02.866
Wow.

24:02.868 --> 24:05.635
For a small town, it was scandalous.

24:05.637 --> 24:06.736
What happens next?

24:06.738 --> 24:08.905
This is where the lawsuit begins.

24:08.907 --> 24:12.876
His biological daughter
really felt slighted...

24:12.878 --> 24:15.812
- Okay...
- and contests the will.

24:15.814 --> 24:17.948
Rosa felt that her father

24:17.950 --> 24:20.116
was so overcome with passion for Etta

24:20.118 --> 24:23.052
- that he rewrote his will.
- You had mentioned on the phone

24:23.054 --> 24:25.188
there was a little bit of insanity.
I guess that came...

24:25.190 --> 24:26.923
talking about him being under her influence?

24:26.925 --> 24:30.393
- That's what it seems.
- Okay, so, how'd it work out?

24:30.395 --> 24:33.763
Well, in the end, Etta won the case.

24:33.765 --> 24:34.798
Really?

24:34.800 --> 24:36.966
Rosa appealed this on two occasions

24:36.968 --> 24:39.535
and lost on appeal both times.

24:43.140 --> 24:45.775
This image I'm seeing
is really strange.

24:45.777 --> 24:50.179
This is that weird [bleep]
creature thing...

24:50.181 --> 24:54.383
crawling oddly down the hall.

24:56.387 --> 24:59.122
Like, I don't know what this
[bleep] thing is, really.

24:59.124 --> 25:00.423
I can't figure out

25:00.425 --> 25:04.227
what this shadow creature
is or where it came from,

25:04.229 --> 25:07.163
but I know that it's been
here for a very long time,

25:07.165 --> 25:09.565
and its goal is to torment living people.

25:09.567 --> 25:11.935
- Does it interact physically?
- Yes.

25:11.937 --> 25:15.105
It makes people kind of [bleep] crazy.

25:23.981 --> 25:27.083
I encountered many entities during my walk,

25:27.085 --> 25:29.285
but two stood out the most...

25:29.287 --> 25:30.453
first, the creepy guy

25:30.455 --> 25:32.889
who's whispering to a
living man in the house.

25:32.891 --> 25:35.158
It was in this room.

25:35.160 --> 25:38.094
His eyes are kind of roundish.

25:38.096 --> 25:40.564
Seemed to have lighter-colored hair.

25:40.566 --> 25:43.433
And what about the second
person that you saw?

25:43.435 --> 25:49.038
He had dark hair,
and he looked like a corpse.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.273
Next, I described

25:50.275 --> 25:53.476
the shadow creature
tormenting a living woman.

25:53.478 --> 25:57.313
She had long hair. Late 30s or early 40s.

25:57.315 --> 25:59.883
And there's this thing in the hallway.

25:59.885 --> 26:05.588
Its skin is really smooth,
a gray/brown kind of color.

26:05.590 --> 26:08.558
Coming down the hallway,
it actually had to be on all fours,

26:08.560 --> 26:11.194
because it's so large.

26:13.297 --> 26:14.831
Amy, is this what you saw?

26:16.834 --> 26:18.034
Yes.

26:38.601 --> 26:41.519
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:41.619 --> 26:42.820
we're ready to reveal our findings

26:42.920 --> 26:46.137
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

26:46.237 --> 26:48.704
Amy, I'd like you to meet Dan and Michelle.

26:48.706 --> 26:50.306
This is their home.

26:50.308 --> 26:53.242
They're raising their two children here.

26:53.244 --> 26:56.145
This is Lucas, who's 17.
This is Shayna, who's 16.

26:56.147 --> 26:58.848
Now, things are pretty bad here

26:58.850 --> 27:00.783
because Michelle and Shayna

27:00.785 --> 27:03.586
are being physically
and emotionally attacked

27:03.588 --> 27:05.388
every night.

27:05.390 --> 27:07.590
The family's put their heart and soul

27:07.592 --> 27:09.825
into this home, as you can see,

27:09.827 --> 27:12.228
and they really don't want to leave.

27:12.230 --> 27:15.464
So now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

27:15.466 --> 27:18.201
I'm gonna ask her to tell us about her walk.

27:18.203 --> 27:20.236
When I got here, I entered the house,

27:20.238 --> 27:23.672
and it was extremely chaotic energy,

27:23.674 --> 27:26.742
especially in the basement.

27:26.744 --> 27:31.547
Like, when I went down there,
I saw all of these dead people.

27:31.549 --> 27:34.216
There was about 50 of them,

27:34.218 --> 27:37.586
which was very shocking.

27:39.889 --> 27:41.257
The scary thing is that

27:41.259 --> 27:43.793
all of those dead people are all negative.

27:43.795 --> 27:46.261
There's not one good person in there,

27:46.263 --> 27:48.964
and that was horrifying.

27:48.966 --> 27:51.567
And one of the things

27:51.569 --> 27:55.638
that also seemed to be a
constant throughout the walk

27:55.640 --> 27:59.175
was the feeling of people thinking

27:59.177 --> 28:03.646
that they're losing their minds,
that they're going crazy.

28:03.648 --> 28:07.917
You guys do experience pretty
bad mood swings, right?

28:07.919 --> 28:10.553
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

28:10.555 --> 28:12.221
We'll be happy and just loving.

28:12.223 --> 28:13.989
We love... We're a strong couple.

28:13.991 --> 28:16.625
And we come in the house,
and the energy just zaps us,

28:16.627 --> 28:18.661
and we'll start fighting immediately.

28:18.663 --> 28:21.764
You come in, you know, it drags you down.

28:21.766 --> 28:23.399
Mm-hmm.

28:23.401 --> 28:26.102
So, during my research of the property,
it turns out

28:26.104 --> 28:28.303
there's a long history of mental illness

28:28.305 --> 28:30.039
associated with the land here.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.708
Back in the 1860s,

28:32.710 --> 28:34.577
the original owners of your property

28:34.579 --> 28:38.013
were two brothers...
Lafayette and Theodore Peek.

28:38.015 --> 28:40.415
There was a little bit of
bad luck with this family.

28:40.417 --> 28:43.118
Both brothers had five kids.
Both brothers lost three kids.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.187
But it got a little bit worse for Theodore.

28:45.189 --> 28:47.290
Apparently, he went nuts...

28:47.292 --> 28:49.692
walking up and down the streets,
talking to himself,

28:49.694 --> 28:51.494
disturbing the peace, screaming,

28:51.496 --> 28:55.731
to the point where his daughter
tried to have him committed.

28:55.733 --> 28:57.099
So, I got the paperwork on that.

28:59.536 --> 29:01.370
The thing is, there's been other cases

29:01.372 --> 29:03.138
of neighbors in the area going crazy, too.

29:03.140 --> 29:06.309
There was another guy that lived
here by the name of John Stitt.

29:06.311 --> 29:09.211
Apparently, this guy was a womanizer.
He had an ex-wife.

29:09.213 --> 29:10.779
He had a daughter. Has an affair

29:10.781 --> 29:13.382
with his neighbor's wife.
He winds up marrying <i> her.</i>

29:13.384 --> 29:16.184
They adopt a little, 14-year-old black girl,

29:16.186 --> 29:17.786
and it was a rumor that he winds up

29:17.788 --> 29:21.290
having an affair with this kid.
She's 14 years old.

29:21.292 --> 29:22.324
Oh.

29:22.326 --> 29:25.260
You know, a little bit crazy.

29:25.262 --> 29:28.063
Yep. That all makes sense.

29:32.002 --> 29:34.703
When I made it over to
the foot of the stairs,

29:34.705 --> 29:36.906
I saw a woman with long, brown hair,

29:36.908 --> 29:40.008
and she was panicking.

29:40.010 --> 29:43.746
I could feel her fear.
She felt extremely overwhelmed.

29:43.748 --> 29:44.980
Somebody that's living?

29:44.982 --> 29:47.883
This is a living person, yes.

29:47.885 --> 29:50.085
The thing is, is that...

29:50.087 --> 29:53.989
the home is so filled with dead energy,

29:53.991 --> 29:57.760
it can negatively affect the body.

29:57.762 --> 30:00.229
And in this person in particular,

30:00.231 --> 30:01.964
I was getting that she might

30:01.966 --> 30:04.166
develop some type of heart issue?

30:06.069 --> 30:08.904
I actually had
a period of time...

30:08.906 --> 30:10.873
which I didn't think it was important,

30:10.875 --> 30:13.075
and I didn't mention it to anybody...

30:13.077 --> 30:16.078
that I was literally blacking out.

30:16.080 --> 30:19.782
And I had to go through
a bunch of heart tests.

30:19.784 --> 30:21.717
And they told me at the time

30:21.719 --> 30:25.654
that I had neural myocardial syncope.

30:25.656 --> 30:27.590
Okay.

30:27.592 --> 30:32.995
That is very common with sensitives.

30:32.997 --> 30:35.964
And unfortunately for mediums,

30:35.966 --> 30:39.802
we can attract things that
aren't particularly good.

30:39.804 --> 30:42.237
You think she's maybe sensitive?

30:42.239 --> 30:43.706
Mm-hmm.

30:43.708 --> 30:46.809
I think the house is full of sensitives.

30:54.050 --> 30:55.818
What else did you see?

30:55.820 --> 31:00.790
One of the other things that
I got was this female was,

31:00.792 --> 31:04.292
at some point in her life,
abused by a male...

31:05.762 --> 31:09.097
and is having a very difficult time

31:09.099 --> 31:11.367
letting that experience go.

31:15.305 --> 31:17.340
I'm sorry, sweetie. I didn't want to

31:17.342 --> 31:19.608
have to bring it up at the table.

31:19.610 --> 31:22.310
You know, could you just share with her

31:22.312 --> 31:24.780
what happened when you were a kid?

31:24.782 --> 31:29.819
When I was a little girl,
between the ages of 3 and 4,

31:29.821 --> 31:31.954
I was left with a male babysitter

31:31.956 --> 31:37.359
who sexually abused me on several occasions.

31:37.361 --> 31:41.930
He used to strip naked in front
of me and chase me around.

31:41.932 --> 31:44.333
And he has since committed suicide.

31:49.907 --> 31:53.175
Why'd you have that big reaction like that?

31:53.177 --> 31:55.177
Uh...

31:56.647 --> 32:01.349
I ran into a person in the basement,

32:01.351 --> 32:04.352
and I referred to him as "The Creeper."

32:06.857 --> 32:10.959
He's very disturbed,

32:10.961 --> 32:14.397
and he attempts to make the living here

32:14.399 --> 32:17.667
do bad things...

32:17.669 --> 32:21.069
make them feel like they're going crazy.

32:21.071 --> 32:25.040
He did not die that long ago,

32:25.042 --> 32:27.877
and I did get that he killed himself.

32:30.146 --> 32:33.315
Well, once you told me that
you thought he committed suicide,

32:33.317 --> 32:35.718
I made some calls.
He went into a parking lot

32:35.720 --> 32:37.720
with a car, broke the tail pipe off,

32:37.722 --> 32:40.355
turned on the heat, windows closed,

32:40.357 --> 32:41.757
in the end of August,

32:41.759 --> 32:44.694
and was found dead.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.561
And the caveat to the whole thing...

32:46.563 --> 32:48.497
He'd just came home from babysitting.

32:53.804 --> 32:55.004
Now, do me a favor

32:55.006 --> 32:58.140
and tell Amy about the attacks every night.

32:58.142 --> 33:02.345
One of the same nightmares
that I have every single night

33:02.347 --> 33:04.379
is that I'm being chased.

33:04.381 --> 33:07.382
You know, I try to, like,
defend myself in the dream,

33:07.384 --> 33:10.318
and I've woken up with fingerprints,

33:10.320 --> 33:12.120
bruises on my thighs.

33:14.359 --> 33:15.858
Wow.

33:15.860 --> 33:17.426
And I get scratched.

33:17.428 --> 33:20.596
My daughter came to us and shared with us

33:20.598 --> 33:24.833
that she felt like somebody
was trying to assault her,

33:24.835 --> 33:27.202
and she has woken up with...

33:27.204 --> 33:29.004
Similar bruises.

33:29.006 --> 33:31.273
Oh, my goodness.

33:31.275 --> 33:33.008
And they're unexplainable.

33:33.010 --> 33:34.409
They got photos.

33:34.411 --> 33:38.714
This is Michelle with some
scratches on her chest area.

33:38.716 --> 33:43.552
There's their daughter, Shayna,
with scratches on her face area.

33:43.554 --> 33:45.320
Wow.

33:45.322 --> 33:47.356
Now, I spoke to a psychologist

33:47.358 --> 33:49.491
just to get a grip on the whole thing,

33:49.493 --> 33:51.026
and you having the nightmares

33:51.028 --> 33:53.095
is totally explainable with the PTSD.

33:53.097 --> 33:54.830
Yes, absolutely.

33:54.832 --> 33:57.332
But the bruising and scratching don't add up

33:57.334 --> 34:00.402
- based on the profile she gave me.
- Okay.

34:00.404 --> 34:03.772
I did do a sketch with the creeper guy.

34:11.114 --> 34:12.347
Take a look.

34:18.487 --> 34:20.956
The sharp nose and the cheekbones...

34:22.958 --> 34:28.496
He definitely reminds me of him.

34:30.299 --> 34:32.301
The strange thing about him is,

34:32.303 --> 34:34.768
I don't think he's the one
harming the women here.

34:34.771 --> 34:39.408
He had very bad intentions
towards the males in the house.

34:39.409 --> 34:43.445
He's trying to plant harmful thoughts,

34:43.447 --> 34:47.149
telling the males in the
household to commit suicide,

34:47.150 --> 34:51.253
wanting to drive them insane.

34:51.255 --> 34:56.091
That's his main goal,
which is very concerning.

34:56.092 --> 34:58.693
He'll never be successful.

34:58.695 --> 35:01.263
Do me a favor and
tell her about the blade

35:01.265 --> 35:02.798
that landed on your foot.

35:02.800 --> 35:07.136
It was on September 11, 2005.

35:07.138 --> 35:09.738
I sat the saw down carefully,

35:09.740 --> 35:11.306
and the saw levitated,

35:11.308 --> 35:14.276
came over my foot,
and chopped off three of my toes.

35:14.278 --> 35:16.211
- Whoa.
- He had a picture of it, too.

35:20.116 --> 35:21.984
Oh, my God.

35:24.988 --> 35:27.289
There is something else that's here

35:27.291 --> 35:33.462
that might be doing the major damage.

35:33.464 --> 35:36.231
The first time I saw it

35:36.233 --> 35:38.901
was when I was about to go up the stairs,

35:38.903 --> 35:43.338
and it was just pitch-black and huge.

35:45.108 --> 35:48.844
It had no face, just kind of a mouth.

35:48.846 --> 35:54.016
It's, like, crawling oddly down the hall.

35:57.153 --> 36:00.089
It's like this on the ceiling.
You know what I'm saying?

36:01.857 --> 36:03.992
So, I did a sketch of a scene.

36:10.433 --> 36:12.300
Take a look.

36:18.474 --> 36:23.345
Sorry. It's really not a good situation.

36:37.078 --> 36:39.812
So, I did a sketch of a scene.

36:47.088 --> 36:49.122
Take a look.

36:57.498 --> 37:01.401
Sorry. It's really not a good situation.

37:13.881 --> 37:16.850
We see a shadow every night

37:16.852 --> 37:20.087
come across the stairwell to the basement...

37:22.223 --> 37:25.558
and it is completely dark.
You cannot see through it.

37:28.195 --> 37:30.763
But is the purpose for watching us?

37:30.765 --> 37:32.432
What is it trying to do?

37:40.742 --> 37:43.710
This thing is extremely old...

37:43.712 --> 37:46.579
never been human.

37:48.815 --> 37:51.751
And it's been wreaking
havoc around this area

37:51.753 --> 37:53.120
for quite some time.

37:53.122 --> 37:56.489
It's caused people to go insane.

37:57.425 --> 38:00.993
Could that explain what happened
to the Peeks and the Stitts

38:00.995 --> 38:03.696
that lived on this property at some point?

38:03.698 --> 38:04.865
Absolutely, yes.

38:08.769 --> 38:12.005
From a Christian standpoint,
you would call it the devil.

38:16.243 --> 38:19.479
There are many of them all over the world,

38:19.481 --> 38:23.350
and they are much more powerful than demons.

38:23.352 --> 38:27.220
Is it this thing that's
giving her all the bruises?

38:27.222 --> 38:28.488
Yes.

38:28.490 --> 38:31.424
Whatever it is that scares you,
whatever it is

38:31.426 --> 38:34.126
that will harm you,
it's going to provide it.

38:36.197 --> 38:40.400
So, this guy here... Did
this devil bring him?

38:40.402 --> 38:43.403
I think it's highly likely.

38:47.108 --> 38:49.342
I'm really worried now.

38:49.344 --> 38:52.278
If this is something
that we can't get rid of,

38:52.280 --> 38:58.819
how am I, you know,
ever gonna be free of that?

39:08.029 --> 39:10.763
Now, Dan, when we spoke,
you said you'd do anything

39:10.765 --> 39:12.965
- to protect your family.
- Absolutely.

39:12.967 --> 39:15.301
Now we're gonna see what it's gonna take

39:15.303 --> 39:18.405
to protect your wife and your daughter.

39:18.407 --> 39:21.007
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:25.746 --> 39:27.547
If you stay here,

39:27.549 --> 39:30.550
there's gonna be a lot
of things you need to do.

39:30.552 --> 39:33.486
You have the devil.

39:33.488 --> 39:36.689
You have the creeper.

39:36.691 --> 39:38.425
You have the 50 dead people.

39:38.427 --> 39:41.794
You would have to hit
everything simultaneously.

39:42.996 --> 39:46.466
So I would recommend a
minister and a Wiccan.

39:46.468 --> 39:51.638
Basically, you would have this
Wiccan priest or priestess

39:51.640 --> 39:54.474
do a clearing and a banishment.

39:54.476 --> 39:59.379
You would have the minister do a blessing.

39:59.381 --> 40:02.249
What they're going to do
is push everybody out.

40:03.717 --> 40:07.420
But... you ain't gonna
get rid of this devil.

40:09.156 --> 40:11.124
So, you're saying the devil

40:11.126 --> 40:14.027
would still be inside their house?

40:14.029 --> 40:16.362
No, they would push it
outside their property line.

40:16.364 --> 40:19.365
But it's not gonna keep him
out of the neighborhood?

40:19.367 --> 40:21.267
Mnh-mnh, no.

40:22.503 --> 40:24.804
It's always been here.

40:26.407 --> 40:28.942
So, now, once the Wiccan and the minister

40:28.944 --> 40:31.411
come in and they do what they need to do,

40:31.413 --> 40:33.846
how do they keep the dead away from here?

40:35.383 --> 40:38.818
What I would suggest is, once a week,

40:38.820 --> 40:41.488
you go out... And you can put a mixture

40:41.490 --> 40:43.790
of salt and holy water

40:43.792 --> 40:47.060
in just a regular spray bottle...

40:47.062 --> 40:49.930
Going around and spraying the perimeter,
and then

40:49.932 --> 40:55.635
spraying all of the window
ledges and all of the doors.

40:57.304 --> 41:00.540
Be very surprised if anything
happens inside the house

41:00.542 --> 41:02.575
once you guys are doing all of this.

41:02.577 --> 41:04.677
As far as your abilities are concerned,

41:04.679 --> 41:06.713
I would begin with

41:06.715 --> 41:10.350
finding an online or
in-person meditation workshop.

41:10.352 --> 41:14.454
I would also recommend therapy for you.

41:18.892 --> 41:22.362
I'm kind of disappointed
in myself right now

41:22.364 --> 41:26.533
that if I brought a lot
of this about my family.

41:26.535 --> 41:27.933
You can't blame yourself

41:27.935 --> 41:29.869
for what happened to you in the past.

41:29.871 --> 41:32.339
This thing was here before we got here.

41:32.341 --> 41:34.640
That's true.

41:36.009 --> 41:38.511
You can't help your family
until you help yourself.

41:38.513 --> 41:41.814
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I'd do anything to help my family.

41:41.816 --> 41:43.683
What are you gonna do?

41:43.685 --> 41:46.386
We're gonna take Amy's advice.

41:46.388 --> 41:48.721
We're gonna take her advice
and do everything as a team.

41:48.723 --> 41:50.823
As long as you do all of these steps,

41:50.825 --> 41:53.059
the safest place will be this house.

41:53.061 --> 41:57.297
I really hope Michelle
and Daniel follow my advice

41:57.299 --> 42:00.500
and deal with the evil that's
terrorizing their family.

42:00.502 --> 42:02.602
With the help of a Wiccan and a minister,

42:02.604 --> 42:04.537
they should be able to free themselves

42:04.539 --> 42:06.606
of the darkness living inside their home.
