02:20.920 --> 02:25.311
The only time I got petted was when
we were out of towels in the bathroom.

02:25.640 --> 02:29.599
Also, Al got a satellite dish
and tried to install it himself.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.268
Watch it, now!

02:35.680 --> 02:39.275
And proving once again that the nut
doesn't fall far from his father...

02:39.520 --> 02:42.796
...Bud decided to mak e
an exercise video starring Kelly.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.031
Raphael is the only star.

02:45.280 --> 02:48.989
Well, if l am not the star,
then l am walking.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.031
However, Bud's biggest problem is...

02:53.240 --> 02:55.800
...he borrowed money from a
little man named Capone...

02:56.000 --> 03:00.073
... who left a big man named Gino
to see that the video is done by 5.

03:00.320 --> 03:02.356
Yo, Gino!

03:09.680 --> 03:11.352
And now, back to the
adventures of...

03:11.560 --> 03:14.313
...Lucky: The Hungriest Dog
in the World.

03:14.560 --> 03:18.269
Or as you humans call it,
Married With Children.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.958
Remember, Bud, 5:00.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.070
Look, Gino...

03:40.320 --> 03:41.753
...let's say l don't make the--

03:42.000 --> 03:44.070
Cutoff point?

03:45.400 --> 03:47.550
Look, let's just say--

03:47.760 --> 03:49.955
What happens if l don't
finish the video on time?

03:50.200 --> 03:52.794
Vito said there was some kind
of easy-payment plan?

03:53.040 --> 03:56.555
lt is easy.
You don't pay us, we kill you.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.430
lt don't get no easier than that.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.831
What do you got in there?

04:03.080 --> 04:06.390
Vito said l had until 5.
lt's not 5:00 yet.

04:06.640 --> 04:10.269
No! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

04:10.520 --> 04:13.159
Take it easy, Spiel-bug.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.277
l'm just checking my e-mail.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.357
Oh, gee, a PowerBook?

04:24.600 --> 04:26.397
l never thought computers were for--

04:26.640 --> 04:28.710
Big, dumb thugs?

04:29.400 --> 04:33.552
See, we use computers now because
the family is very much into recycling.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.758
Oh, you mean, like
glass, papers, cans?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.389
No. Body parts.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.999
Say, for a hypothetical, it's 5:00...

04:43.240 --> 04:44.992
...Vito walks in, he ain't got no tape.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.156
So l look up in my PowerBook...

04:47.400 --> 04:49.960
...and see that Jim in Jersey
needs a spleen.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.317
So we recycle your spleen into Jim.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.434
Problem, solution.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.880
Can l live without a spleen?

05:02.960 --> 05:07.954
Perhaps, but little Joey in New Haven
needs a brain.

05:10.840 --> 05:14.799
Kelly, Raphael, it's showtime.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.040
-Hi, Officer Dan.
-Break a leg.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.992
Ante up.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.034
Peggy, thank you so much
for having us over to watch...

05:24.240 --> 05:29.792
-...our husbands fall off the roof.
-Yeah, my Dan does so little work...

05:30.000 --> 05:32.673
...around the house l never get to
see him step on a nail...

05:32.880 --> 05:36.316
...or accidentally shoot himself
cleaning his gun, or anything.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.629
Well, at least you get to see
your husband's gun.

05:43.160 --> 05:48.075
Okay, girls, now it's time to play
Who's Next to Fall...

05:49.480 --> 05:53.109
...where we will bet on
which husband will fall next.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.510
And where they'll land.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.876
l'll take Al on the patio.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.553
Bring a book.

06:00.560 --> 06:05.509
Oh, l'll take Bob Rooney
on the birdbath.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.160
Give me lke on the garden rake.

06:11.360 --> 06:15.478
Okay, l'll take Officer Dan on lke.

06:22.080 --> 06:26.119
lke got the garden rake.
We have a winner!

06:34.280 --> 06:39.195
Officer Dan on lke.
We have two winners!

06:40.040 --> 06:43.669
Maybe l should just paint a target
on my back the next time.

06:46.720 --> 06:50.395
Hey, gentlemen!
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.876
Now we've all hit the ground
at least twice.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.638
-Well, l haven't.
-Well, give us a second.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.197
All right, now.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.874
Now that we've got that
out of our systems.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.396
-No more fooling around.
-All right, all right. Let's see here.

07:19.640 --> 07:24.111
l've got bracket S and washer T.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.317
Hey, Dan, hand me screw U.

07:30.480 --> 07:33.870
-What?
-l said, screw U.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.712
Up yours, you--

07:35.920 --> 07:39.993
Hey, focus, gentlemen! Focus, focus.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.273
Now, we've all got a job to do.

07:48.080 --> 07:51.152
Well, l guess Al won't be needing
this old antenna anymore.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.868
Hey, wait, you can't tear that down.

07:54.120 --> 07:57.078
This is the home
of a future baby bird.

07:59.640 --> 08:03.474
The only future for this baby
is in an omelette for me.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.553
You're making a big mistake,
Bob Rooney.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.028
You touch an egg...

08:08.280 --> 08:11.192
...that makes the mama bird
really mad.

08:11.400 --> 08:15.393
Well, l don't see no
mama bird around.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.073
Maybe not...

08:17.320 --> 08:20.676
...but there's a B-52 with a beak.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.197
Hey! Hey! Put me down!

08:29.440 --> 08:32.273
Let me go!

08:34.200 --> 08:38.078
Who would have thought a bird could
lift Bob Rooney 7 0 feet in the air?

08:38.919 --> 08:42.071
Well, she won't make 1 00.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.480
Oh, it's Bob Rooney on Griff.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.075
Daily double.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.111
Do you have '' Mortal Kombat'' in there?

08:59.360 --> 09:02.670
Are you kidding?
l got the highest score in the mob.

09:04.840 --> 09:07.229
Gino, good news.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.436
l can kill you now?

09:10.600 --> 09:13.239
No, l meant good news for me.
l patched things up...

09:13.440 --> 09:15.670
-...between Kelly and Raphael.
-How?

09:15.920 --> 09:17.990
l did what any respectable director
would do.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.998
l lied to them and offered them points
in the film.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.038
-Net?
-Of course.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.074
Okay, guys.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.550
lf we're ready, everybody
on their opening marks.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.916
Places, babes.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.918
Okay! Let's cue the music.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.628
-Who brought the music?
-l did.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.350
Raphael did.

09:44.560 --> 09:45.879
This isn't a problem.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.588
l'm gonna listen to them both
and choose the best one.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.957
lf you don't use my music,
then l am walking.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.351
lf you don't use Raphael's music,
he is walking.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.353
And do not try to stop us.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.199
Bud, l got good news.

10:10.440 --> 10:13.000
You're gonna see Paris.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.558
You're gonna send me to Paris?

10:20.800 --> 10:22.597
No, just your eyes.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.878
Look, guys, we said
we'd give it a try.

10:33.120 --> 10:36.192
Raphael, l promised you your
name would come first...

10:36.440 --> 10:39.000
...when l report him to the lNS.

10:40.520 --> 10:44.354
And, Kelly, l promised you a star
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.989
Right next to Garfield, right?

10:48.800 --> 10:50.358
Okay.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.990
Raphael will do it,
but he will not smile.

10:54.240 --> 10:57.198
Okay. l will do it, and l will smile.

10:57.440 --> 11:01.433
But when l am facing Raphael, l am
going to stick out my tongue like this.

11:03.120 --> 11:06.032
Okay, okay. Now, that we're
all adults...

11:06.280 --> 11:08.748
...can we please start
this damn exercise video?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.833
Kelly, you won the toss,
we'll open the number with your music.

11:12.040 --> 11:16.079
Okay, okay? Ready, and....

11:33.600 --> 11:36.592
Cut! Cut! Cut!

11:41.160 --> 11:42.798
Raphael.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.639
What's the matter?

11:46.880 --> 11:48.518
Raphael is much man.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.718
He cannot work out to this noise.

11:51.960 --> 11:56.238
He would much rather give
CPR to Rosie O'Donell.

11:57.640 --> 12:01.235
Fine. Then let's see what you
have, munch man.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.278
That is much man.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.511
Not from here.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.918
Okay, okay, okay. Fine.

12:11.160 --> 12:14.596
Let's just dance
to Raphael's music, okay?

12:15.200 --> 12:18.909
Ready. Five, six, seven, eight.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.952
All right, stop the music!

12:34.200 --> 12:35.599
Cut!

12:39.120 --> 12:40.678
Now what?

12:40.920 --> 12:44.310
ls it just me or does anybody else here
feel like sneaking into Canada...

12:44.520 --> 12:46.954
...under the cover of darkness?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.277
That is it.

12:49.520 --> 12:50.999
We are walking.

12:51.240 --> 12:53.515
So are Kelly.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.116
Good teeth, Bud.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.790
l like that in a dead guy.

13:10.720 --> 13:13.439
Hey, Gino, how's the kid doing?

13:13.680 --> 13:16.592
He's not that talented, Bebe,
but he's got a lot of heart.

13:16.840 --> 13:21.277
That's good, because l got a guy
in Chattanooga that needs one.

13:23.760 --> 13:27.309
Gino, you'll never guess what me
and Vito did.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.993
You're gonna love this.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.195
Guys, can we just--?

13:30.400 --> 13:34.109
Can we just, please, work together
and decide on a song?

13:34.360 --> 13:37.830
l mean, we're talking about something
even more valuable than your pride.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.155
My life.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.597
Raphael would rather have you die
a thousand deaths before he dances...

13:42.800 --> 13:44.870
...to her trashy music.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.588
Yeah? l would rather have him die
a million deaths...

13:47.840 --> 13:51.310
...before l dance to your
coochie-hoochie music.

13:51.720 --> 13:54.871
Then Raphael would rather beat him
to death with his very own hands--

13:55.080 --> 13:56.718
-l'd rather--
-Thank you, thank you!

13:56.960 --> 13:59.679
Look, before my internal organs...

13:59.880 --> 14:03.555
...absolutely, positively
have to be there overnight...

14:05.680 --> 14:08.797
...l just wanna say,
l hate you both. Okay?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.070
Kelly, you want to dance
to your music? Fine.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.396
Dance to your music.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.590
And, Raphael, you can dance
to your music. Here.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.751
Okay. Okay, guys,
you can kill me now.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.956
But just do me one favour, okay?

14:24.200 --> 14:26.953
Tell me where to stand so the bullet
goes through them too.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.475
-Not a problem.
-lt would be a pleasure.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.996
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
These musics sound good together.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.275
l could dance to this.

14:34.480 --> 14:37.438
Raphael could dance
to this musics too.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.273
Hold it. Hold the killing.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.431
They're dancing.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.557
-Damn.
-Damn.

15:16.240 --> 15:20.153
l can't believe those idiots still
haven't got that satellite working.

15:20.400 --> 15:24.359
And look at this reception.
The more they try, the worse it gets.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.875
Just like in bed.

15:28.600 --> 15:32.957
Let's face it, girls, they are never
gonna get that dish hooked up.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.318
Man, this satellite dish is great.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.949
Look at all these
different channels. There's...

15:49.200 --> 15:51.430
...the wrestling channel.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.989
There's the oil-wrestling channel.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.789
The mud-wrestling channel.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.315
The violence channel.

16:03.400 --> 16:07.029
And best of all, no wife channel.

16:09.560 --> 16:12.711
The wives don't even realize
we've got the dish hooked up.

16:13.640 --> 16:18.794
What a bunch of fools,
living down there, inside the house.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.475
Hey. Hey, you know, Captain Kirk
was wrong.

16:21.720 --> 16:25.872
The final frontier isn't space.
lt's the roof.

16:26.360 --> 16:29.875
All those years lying on my back
staring at the ceiling...

16:30.120 --> 16:32.270
...just praying my misery
would go away...

16:32.520 --> 16:34.795
...how could l know
that my little bit of heaven...

16:35.000 --> 16:37.753
...was a mere 1 0 feet
above my head?

16:39.160 --> 16:41.594
How's it coming, Al?

16:41.840 --> 16:44.195
Oh, about five minutes, Peg.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.671
And cut it.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.480
Oh, that was beautiful.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.711
Great job, Kelly.

16:59.240 --> 17:01.800
Great job, Raphy baby.

17:04.079 --> 17:07.277
l just love you babes.

17:11.520 --> 17:16.833
Listen, when the dim blond
and El Boy-o Loco leave...

17:18.400 --> 17:22.279
...you guys stick around
and we'll make us a real movie.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.039
All right, that's a wrap.

17:26.280 --> 17:29.875
Except for you chicks,
who will soon be unwrapped.

17:31.760 --> 17:35.116
Excuse me, but Raphael
never leaves a shoot...

17:35.360 --> 17:40.639
...until he is certain the director
has featured his good buttock.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.237
Whoa, there, stomach, settle down.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.232
Well, since we finished
an hour early...

17:49.480 --> 17:52.199
...l guess we have time
to replay my masterpiece.

17:52.440 --> 17:53.998
Let's check it out.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.512
Oh, man.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.511
Hitchcock...

18:20.680 --> 18:22.352
...if you have a free hand...

18:22.600 --> 18:25.910
...would you mind rewinding the tape
so that we can see me dancing?

18:26.160 --> 18:28.913
Or Raphael dancing.

18:33.760 --> 18:37.309
Gino, you'll never guess what me
and Vito did.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.039
You're gonna love this.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.350
You remember Alderman Harris?

18:41.600 --> 18:43.272
The guy that stiffed us for 20 G's?

18:43.520 --> 18:45.476
Well, you know what our motto is.

18:45.720 --> 18:48.917
He who stiffs us becomes one.

18:49.560 --> 18:53.235
So Vito sends his kidneys to Texas.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.153
-He killed him?
-Not yet.

18:58.760 --> 19:05.233
Bud, l'm starting to get the feeling
that these guys may be, you know:

19:08.520 --> 19:11.432
What, really annoying?

19:12.560 --> 19:15.552
No. Mobsters.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.916
Wise guys.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.234
Jolly goodfellas.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.597
Do you think, Kel?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.675
lf they find out
we have this on tape...

19:29.920 --> 19:31.797
...they will kill Raphael
in such a way...

19:32.000 --> 19:34.753
... that he cannot have
an open-casket funeral.

19:35.520 --> 19:39.274
Listen, we got one hour. All we have to
do is edit out the incriminating stuff...

19:39.480 --> 19:41.869
...before Vito gets here,
and there's no problem.

19:42.360 --> 19:44.078
Hey, Bud.

19:44.760 --> 19:47.911
-Now there's a problem.
-l know l'm a little early...

19:48.120 --> 19:51.032
...but l couldn't wait
to see the tape. Here, give me.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.038
l would but....

19:55.440 --> 19:59.069
Raphael, tell him why we
can't give him the tape.

19:59.480 --> 20:03.359
Oh, well, you see, because--

20:03.560 --> 20:06.154
Kelly, why don't you tell them
why we can't give the tape.

20:06.400 --> 20:10.916
Because we recorded stuff about you
sending the guy's kidneys to Texas.

20:14.320 --> 20:16.709
Way to throw them off track, Kel.

20:17.640 --> 20:18.595
Do them.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.234
And when you're done, Bebe,
do yourself.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.993
Can do, boss.

20:23.240 --> 20:25.993
Wait, wait, wait. Look, look,
Mr. Capone.

20:26.240 --> 20:30.233
Please, look, l can understand you
wanting to kill us...

20:30.480 --> 20:32.516
...but please spare my sister.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.478
She's harmless.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.272
l mean, she could never
identify you.

20:36.480 --> 20:40.189
She can't even grasp the concept
of up and down.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.669
Down yours, Bud.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.879
Sorry, kid, but as they
say in Hollywood...

20:48.120 --> 20:49.917
...you'll never work
in this town again.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.116
Or any town.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.670
Hold it, Capone! Police.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.234
Put your guns down
and your hands against the wall.

21:03.480 --> 21:06.119
-Frisk them, Farrah.
-You got it, Kate.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.430
Come on, Jaclyn.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.675
l'd thank you,
but it's not proper for stars...

21:14.920 --> 21:17.992
...to associate
with background dancers.

21:25.040 --> 21:29.238
Where could you have possibly
concealed those weapons?

21:30.480 --> 21:32.038
l touched you all over.

21:32.280 --> 21:36.193
We know. That's why you're
going to jail.

21:36.760 --> 21:39.911
Soon you, too, will be
touched all over.

21:40.120 --> 21:43.032
Wait, wait! No!

21:53.600 --> 21:56.512
Good neighbour. Good neighbour.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.674
All right, lights out. Watch the news.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.997
And in local news,
three organized crime figures...

22:08.200 --> 22:10.953
...whose names have been withheld
to protect their privacy...

22:11.200 --> 22:13.555
... were convicted of murder
and rack eteering...

22:13.800 --> 22:18.351
.. fined $1 0 and given 50 hours
of community service.

22:19.240 --> 22:20.958
In a related crime story...

22:21.200 --> 22:23.555
...video director
Bud Franklin Bundy...

22:23.800 --> 22:27.156
... whose home address is
available upon request...

22:27.400 --> 22:30.995
... was the first man to be given
a life sentence under the new...

22:31.200 --> 22:35.318
... ''one strik e and you're out''
sexual-harassment law.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.434
Don't worry...

22:37.680 --> 22:40.638
...l have corrupt friends downtown.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.188
Let's go get him out.

22:44.520 --> 22:45.919
Hey, wait, guys.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.479
l see hooters.

22:47.720 --> 22:49.836
Hooters, hooters, hooters!

22:50.080 --> 22:53.356
Hooters, hooters, hooters!
