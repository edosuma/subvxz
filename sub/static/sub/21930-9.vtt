WEBVTT

00:01.597 --> 00:05.132
Why are they making
four more <i>Avatar</i> movies?

00:05.134 --> 00:07.535
It's not like the first one
is even that good.

00:07.537 --> 00:09.904
What are you talking about?
You love that movie.

00:09.906 --> 00:11.906
You even went as <i>Avatar</i>
for Halloween.

00:11.908 --> 00:16.043
I remember. That was
not a lot of clothes.

00:16.045 --> 00:18.045
Hey, guys.

00:18.047 --> 00:19.380
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:19.382 --> 00:22.416
I'm, uh, I'm running
a special today, uh,

00:22.418 --> 00:26.086
buy something, keep having
a comic book store to come to.

00:26.088 --> 00:28.055
This is awkward.

00:28.057 --> 00:29.890
I was actually gonna
return this.

00:29.892 --> 00:31.592
What's wrong with it?

00:31.594 --> 00:33.460
I-I finished it.

00:34.397 --> 00:37.865
Speaking of something
I find interesting,

00:37.867 --> 00:40.768
did anyone read that article
about Bitcoin I sent you?

00:40.770 --> 00:42.670
Yeah, I can't believe
a single Bitcoin

00:42.672 --> 00:45.072
is worth about $5,000 now.

00:45.074 --> 00:48.776
Wait, didn't we mine some
a few years ago?

00:48.778 --> 00:50.911
It was seven years ago.

00:50.913 --> 00:53.347
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

00:53.349 --> 00:55.316
Really? All I can remember
from seven years ago

00:55.318 --> 00:59.053
is I couldn't get Kesha's
"Tik Tok" out of my head.

00:59.055 --> 01:02.756
♪ Tik Tok, on the clock... ♪
Whoa, welcome home, Kesha.

01:04.193 --> 01:05.693
No, we-we definitely mined some.

01:05.695 --> 01:08.329
I-I remember sitting in your
bedroom and writing the program.

01:08.331 --> 01:10.497
I think we ended up
with a bunch of it.

01:10.499 --> 01:13.834
Wow, and at, like,
$5,000 apiece, that's...

01:13.836 --> 01:17.304
Sounds like a lot of money,
which we agreed to share

01:17.306 --> 01:20.874
'cause I-I was totally there.
I remember now.

01:21.944 --> 01:24.144
I can't believe
we forgot about it.

01:24.146 --> 01:25.212
It's not that surprising.

01:25.214 --> 01:27.047
They were basically worthless
when we got them.

01:27.049 --> 01:29.316
I wish I knew
how much we had.

01:29.318 --> 01:30.918
Sheldon,
you must remember.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.386
Of course I do.

01:32.388 --> 01:34.755
Oh, yeah, he and I
totally remember.

01:35.558 --> 01:38.058
You tell them, Sheldon.

01:39.295 --> 01:42.429
I can't believe you haven't
seen <i>Avatar</i> yet.

01:42.431 --> 01:43.764
What is wrong with you?

01:43.766 --> 01:45.299
Penny and I just started dating,

01:45.301 --> 01:47.201
and you know
I don't like big crowds.

01:47.203 --> 01:49.436
Because you're afraid Penny will
leave you for someone in them?

01:49.438 --> 01:50.971
Terrified.

01:52.074 --> 01:53.474
Yes, instead of going out,

01:53.476 --> 01:55.976
they just stay home
and have constant coitus.

01:55.978 --> 02:00.748
Well, I didn't want to say it,
but I-I do like to hear it.

02:01.584 --> 02:05.319
Yes, Ma, I'll be
home for dinner.

02:05.321 --> 02:09.156
No, I'm not ruining
my appetite with candy.

02:10.026 --> 02:11.925
Oh, we're having brisket?

02:11.927 --> 02:13.460
(spits)
Be home at 6:00.

02:15.598 --> 02:16.864
Maybe we should double date.

02:16.866 --> 02:19.099
I'll bring Penny
and you can bring your mom.

02:20.136 --> 02:21.302
Oh, make your jokes,

02:21.304 --> 02:23.037
but my date started
a savings account for me.

02:23.039 --> 02:24.238
Did yours?

02:25.975 --> 02:27.474
Hey, you guys.
OTHERS: Hey.

02:27.476 --> 02:28.842
Oh, Stuart, good.
I was wondering,

02:28.844 --> 02:30.678
will you be accepting Bitcoin?

02:30.680 --> 02:33.881
Well, I don't know what that is,
but it's got "coin" in it,

02:33.883 --> 02:38.952
and my cash register doesn't,
so... yeah.

02:39.689 --> 02:41.188
Wait, what's Bitcoin?

02:41.190 --> 02:43.824
It's a new online currency
that's been developed.

02:43.826 --> 02:45.759
Uh, it's just like
actual money,

02:45.761 --> 02:49.229
except you can't see it, hold
it, or spend it on anything.

02:49.231 --> 02:52.599
Sounds like the kind of money
I'm familiar with.

02:54.670 --> 02:56.437
If it's not tangible,
how do you know

02:56.439 --> 02:58.539
it's not just gonna
vanish tomorrow?

02:58.541 --> 03:00.607
Really? You're dating Penny, and
you're gonna poke at something

03:00.609 --> 03:02.309
that could vanish tomorrow?

03:03.312 --> 03:04.812
I'll buy some Bitcoin.

03:04.814 --> 03:06.714
I just came into
a little extra money

03:06.716 --> 03:08.649
when my dad raised my allowance.

03:08.651 --> 03:11.819
You don't have
to buy Bitcoin.

03:11.821 --> 03:13.153
You can mine it.

03:13.155 --> 03:15.923
Mine it?
Like, mining gold?

03:15.925 --> 03:17.591
Sort of.
There's a limited amount,

03:17.593 --> 03:20.194
and we find it,
not by tunneling into the earth,

03:20.196 --> 03:23.597
but by using a computer to solve
complex mathematical problems.

03:23.599 --> 03:24.732
So let me get this straight.

03:24.734 --> 03:26.533
We have to write
an elaborate program

03:26.535 --> 03:30.304
in order to find a fake coin
that we can't spend on anything?

03:30.306 --> 03:32.973
Yes.
That sounds fun.

03:32.975 --> 03:34.041
Yeah, I'm in.

03:34.043 --> 03:35.109
LEONARD:
Staying up late,

03:35.111 --> 03:37.678
writing code,
it sounds like a party.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.113
Hey, Stuart.

03:39.115 --> 03:40.614
You want to mine
some Bitcoin with us?

03:40.616 --> 03:42.015
We'll write the program,
you bring the snacks?

03:42.017 --> 03:44.651
Too rich for my blood.

03:44.653 --> 03:47.454
All right, so just
the four of us.

03:47.456 --> 03:48.689
Before we begin,

03:48.691 --> 03:52.559
this may have some
unprecedented tax implications.

03:52.561 --> 03:54.395
In fact, we should start
early 'cause we are gonna be

03:54.397 --> 03:56.230
on the phone with
the IRS for hours.

03:56.232 --> 03:58.832
(gasps) Did anybody else
just get goose bumps?

03:59.502 --> 04:01.769
Great, so just the three of us.

04:03.139 --> 04:05.539
Oh, yeah.
We did it without you.

04:05.541 --> 04:08.041
And do you remember
what happened next?

04:08.043 --> 04:11.278
Your mom called my mom
and said we were being mean?

04:11.280 --> 04:13.881
And after that?

04:14.850 --> 04:17.684
You said that someday
we'd regret this.

04:17.685 --> 04:19.219
And do you know

04:19.221 --> 04:20.587
what today is?

04:20.589 --> 04:23.724
The day we found out we're rich
and none of it is yours?

04:23.726 --> 04:25.793
(laughter, whooping)

04:25.795 --> 04:29.930
Yeah, that's right!

04:56.645 --> 04:58.278
I was using in 2010.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.146
The Bitcoin
must be on here.

05:00.148 --> 05:02.849
So what are you gonna do
with your share of the money?

05:02.851 --> 05:04.350
Uh, well,
as a responsible adult,

05:04.352 --> 05:06.986
I'll put that money into a CD,
wait for that CD to mature,

05:06.988 --> 05:09.389
and then buy a tiger.

05:15.464 --> 05:16.663
How about you?

05:16.665 --> 05:17.831
Oh, that depends on

05:17.833 --> 05:20.733
whether I tell
Bernadette or not.

05:20.735 --> 05:22.135
BERNADETTE:
Howard, I can hear you.

05:22.137 --> 05:23.937
The baby monitor is on.

05:25.340 --> 05:27.507
I know. I was joking.

05:27.509 --> 05:28.608
I'm gonna put it

05:28.610 --> 05:30.143
in a college fund.

05:34.950 --> 05:36.950
All right, all booted up.

05:36.952 --> 05:38.885
Wow, I-I knew you
were single back then,

05:38.887 --> 05:40.520
but that is
a lot of porn...

05:40.522 --> 05:42.956
Science!
A lot of science.

05:42.958 --> 05:46.893
Wow, you were really
into Asian science.

05:49.030 --> 05:50.763
I don't see the Bitcoin on here.

05:50.765 --> 05:52.465
Hey, maybe it's in
that folder marked

05:52.467 --> 05:53.800
"Private and Confidential."

05:53.802 --> 05:55.368
BERNADETTE:
It's not!

05:57.372 --> 06:00.073
Okay, the program
is almost ready to run.

06:00.075 --> 06:02.976
Mining for coins
sounds so manly.

06:02.978 --> 06:05.979
Ooh, we should sing
a mining song.

06:05.981 --> 06:07.647
Do you know a mining song?

06:07.649 --> 06:08.715
I don't know.

06:08.717 --> 06:10.583
Does "Tik Tok"
by Kesha count?

06:10.585 --> 06:13.720
Because it has tunneled
its way into my heart.

06:14.923 --> 06:16.723
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, what's going on?!

06:16.725 --> 06:18.525
Are you boys roughhousing?!

06:18.527 --> 06:20.827
No, we're not roughhousing!

06:20.829 --> 06:24.564
We're scientists!
Scientists don't roughhouse!

06:24.566 --> 06:28.067
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Excuse me, Mr. Grown-up.

06:29.638 --> 06:30.970
Aw, man,
what happened?

06:30.972 --> 06:32.238
It crashed.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.840
It's been doing that lately.

06:33.842 --> 06:36.476
I think it's got a virus
from all the...

06:36.478 --> 06:39.178
music I've been downloading.

06:39.180 --> 06:40.680
What kind of music?

06:40.682 --> 06:43.383
Mostly Asian.

06:45.787 --> 06:47.487
Some oldies.

06:47.489 --> 06:50.857
Well, we can
use my laptop.

06:50.859 --> 06:53.026
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, I made cookies

06:53.028 --> 06:55.361
for you and your little friends!

06:55.363 --> 06:58.331
They're not my little friends,
and we don't want cookies!

06:58.333 --> 06:59.365
Actually, a cookie sounds good.

06:59.367 --> 07:00.633
All right, we'll have cookies!

07:00.635 --> 07:02.235
Thank you very much!

07:03.305 --> 07:05.371
That's right.
It must be on my old laptop.

07:05.373 --> 07:06.639
Well, let's go.

07:06.641 --> 07:08.541
Hey, Bernie, you mind if
I run to Leonard's and...

07:08.543 --> 07:09.943
BERNADETTE:
Get a laptop full of money?

07:09.945 --> 07:13.046
Why are you still here?!
Go, go, go!

07:15.383 --> 07:17.050
So, how's the wedding
planning going?

07:17.052 --> 07:18.518
Great.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.054
Although, we're having trouble
agreeing on a location.

07:21.056 --> 07:22.889
I thought you were looking
at a cliff on the beach.

07:22.891 --> 07:25.858
We were, but Sheldon
didn't like any of them.

07:27.462 --> 07:32.131
Some were too beachy,
some were too cliffy.

07:32.133 --> 07:35.635
And all of them
were too outsidey.

07:36.705 --> 07:38.271
Well, weddings aren't
about the location.

07:38.273 --> 07:40.506
They're about standing up in
front of your family and friends

07:40.508 --> 07:43.710
and promising that Sheldon
will never move back in here.

07:45.180 --> 07:47.614
Hi.
PENNY: Hey.

07:47.616 --> 07:48.715
What are you guys doing?

07:48.717 --> 07:50.917
Uh, we have a bunch of Bitcoin
on an old laptop,

07:50.919 --> 07:52.885
and it could be worth,
like, a lot of money.

07:52.887 --> 07:53.920
What... You're kidding.

07:53.922 --> 07:56.422
No. We-we could be
sitting on a fortune.

07:56.424 --> 07:58.625
Okay, let the record show,
I did not marry you for money,

07:58.627 --> 08:00.994
but you just got
way more attractive.

08:00.996 --> 08:03.997
Damn it,
it's not in here.

08:03.999 --> 08:07.400
If only you had someone around
with an eidetic memory.

08:09.070 --> 08:11.571
I bet they would know
what happened to it.

08:11.573 --> 08:13.339
If you know, just tell us.

08:13.341 --> 08:15.541
Excuse me, but if I recall
from seven years ago,

08:15.543 --> 08:17.910
you don't want me
to be a part of this.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.446
Sheldon,
you can't still be mad.

08:20.448 --> 08:21.547
Oh, please.

08:21.549 --> 08:23.583
I have grudges that
go back to preschool.

08:24.986 --> 08:27.487
Someday, I'm gonna find
a grown-up Elaine Dwyer

08:27.489 --> 08:31.124
and eat her favorite crayon
while she watches.

08:31.126 --> 08:34.660
Is that why there's an
Elaine Dwyer on our guest list?

08:34.663 --> 08:36.095
Yes.

08:36.097 --> 08:38.231
That night, I'm going to have
the first dance

08:38.232 --> 08:41.200
and the last laugh.

08:41.202 --> 08:43.269
Sheldon, please.

08:43.270 --> 08:45.505
Should I be the bigger man?

08:45.507 --> 08:46.873
I think you should.

08:46.875 --> 08:48.841
(snorts)
Oh, why'd I ask you?

08:51.646 --> 08:54.313
Hey there, pretty lady.

08:54.315 --> 08:56.816
I'm not waiting
on your table for you.

08:56.818 --> 09:00.186
Come on,
this one is so annoying.

09:00.188 --> 09:02.055
Excuse me, waitress.

09:02.057 --> 09:04.590
You guys ready
to order?

09:04.592 --> 09:06.526
Can you take
our picture, please?

09:06.528 --> 09:07.927
Oh, sure.

09:07.929 --> 09:09.128
Smile!

09:13.268 --> 09:14.967
Perfect.

09:14.969 --> 09:16.969
Thank you.
You may go now.

09:16.971 --> 09:18.137
It was nice to meet you,

09:18.139 --> 09:21.708
and I mean that politely,
not sincerely.

09:22.744 --> 09:24.043
What was that?

09:24.045 --> 09:26.446
I need to prove to my mother
that I'm on a date.

09:26.448 --> 09:27.814
If she thinks
I faked the picture,

09:27.816 --> 09:29.649
I might need you as a witness.
What's your name?

09:29.651 --> 09:32.318
Bernadette.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.320
PENNY:
Hey, sweetie.

09:34.322 --> 09:35.254
Hey.
Everybody good?

09:35.256 --> 09:36.989
- Yeah. - Fine.
- Sure.

09:39.027 --> 09:42.161
You don't have to whisper,
you can just nod your head.

09:44.132 --> 09:46.499
Or you could just speak.

09:48.336 --> 09:49.769
You having a good day?

09:49.771 --> 09:51.204
No, I missed an audition

09:51.206 --> 09:53.072
because my computer broke,
and I didn't get the e-mail.

09:53.074 --> 09:55.074
Would've been
a perfect part for me.

09:55.076 --> 09:56.876
Was it waitress
who ignores her customers?

09:56.878 --> 09:59.212
Because that's the role
you were born to play.

09:59.214 --> 10:01.881
Shut up and eat your burger.

10:01.883 --> 10:04.117
Actually, it's a turkey club.

10:04.119 --> 10:05.118
Didn't you order a burger?

10:05.120 --> 10:07.386
I did, and yet here we are.

10:07.388 --> 10:10.223
You know what,
if you need a computer,

10:10.225 --> 10:11.891
you can use my laptop.

10:11.893 --> 10:14.093
Oh, that's sweet, but I'm not
gonna take your computer.

10:14.095 --> 10:15.728
Oh, it's fine.
I-I'm getting a new one anyway.

10:15.730 --> 10:17.363
Are you sure?
SHELDON: Don't be silly.

10:17.365 --> 10:19.198
He's desperate
to hold on to you.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.033
You can get anything out of him.

10:21.035 --> 10:22.502
His car, his watch...

10:22.504 --> 10:24.637
Maybe a kidney.
You already have his testicles.

10:24.639 --> 10:26.706
You can start a collection.

10:28.276 --> 10:30.810
Oh, my God, that's right.
You gave me your laptop.

10:30.812 --> 10:32.044
That was so sweet.

10:32.046 --> 10:33.579
So you know where it is?
Of course.

10:33.581 --> 10:34.914
- All right! - Yes!
- Great!

10:34.916 --> 10:36.182
I gave it to
my ex-boyfriend Zack.

10:36.184 --> 10:38.417
- Come on! - Why?!
- No!

10:41.519 --> 10:43.085
PENNY: Okay, Zack,
thank you so much.

10:43.087 --> 10:44.119
We'll be right over.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.754
He still has it.

10:45.756 --> 10:48.624
I can't believe you took
a gift from me

10:48.626 --> 10:50.159
and gave it to another man.

10:50.161 --> 10:51.694
SHELDON:
Really?

10:51.696 --> 10:53.762
Of all the things she's given
to other men,

10:53.764 --> 10:55.264
that's what you're
concerned about?

10:57.235 --> 10:59.668
Please don't make
a big deal about this.

10:59.670 --> 11:02.238
It was a long time ago,
we were broken up.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.405
Which breakup was that?

11:03.407 --> 11:05.774
Was that the Saint
Valentine's Day Massacre?

11:06.477 --> 11:07.843
No, no.

11:07.845 --> 11:10.312
This might've been during
the Comic-Con Dump-A-Thon.

11:11.215 --> 11:12.648
You have names for our breakups?

11:12.650 --> 11:15.417
Well, they would really
blur together if we didn't.

11:16.554 --> 11:18.287
The Comic-Con breakup's
easy to remember

11:18.289 --> 11:21.957
because Leonard
was the saddest Pikachu.

11:21.959 --> 11:24.360
Right, and he wiped his nose
on your cape,

11:24.362 --> 11:26.762
and then you were
the saddest Darth Vader.

11:28.666 --> 11:31.900
You know, Penny and I aren't
the only ones who've broken up.

11:31.902 --> 11:33.435
So did Howard and Bernadette.

11:33.437 --> 11:37.873
Uh, not to brag, but all
my breakups have lasted.

11:39.410 --> 11:41.744
I'm so sorry to hear
about you and Howard.

11:41.746 --> 11:43.979
Thanks. I just
didn't think he was

11:43.981 --> 11:46.649
the kind of guy who would be
doing weird stuff online.

11:46.651 --> 11:50.052
Really? Wow, I thought
it was so obvious, but okay.

11:51.289 --> 11:53.489
Look, I know it's hard,
but I think the best thing

11:53.491 --> 11:55.624
to do after a breakup
is to take some time

11:55.626 --> 11:56.659
and be by yourself.

11:56.661 --> 11:59.061
Yeah, that's healthy.

11:59.063 --> 12:00.229
Hey, babe,
ready to go?

12:00.231 --> 12:02.298
Do as I say, not as I do.

12:06.003 --> 12:08.671
I cannot believe you're mad.

12:08.673 --> 12:09.772
I'm not mad.

12:09.774 --> 12:12.074
Oh, really?
Tell that to your eyebrows.

12:12.076 --> 12:15.911
Bet I could place a
quarter between them,

12:15.913 --> 12:18.714
and it would
just stay there.

12:18.716 --> 12:20.883
Fine, I'm mad.

12:20.885 --> 12:23.485
I guess I was more upset
by our breakup than you.

12:23.487 --> 12:25.587
That is not true.
Of course I was upset.

12:25.589 --> 12:26.755
Didn't seem like it.

12:26.757 --> 12:28.157
You started dating the first

12:28.159 --> 12:30.359
tall, handsome hunk
you could find.

12:30.361 --> 12:31.660
I'm sorry,

12:31.662 --> 12:36.665
are you mad that I dated Zack
or that you didn't?

12:41.472 --> 12:43.372
- Hi. - Hi.
- Hey, Zack.

12:43.374 --> 12:45.741
So good to see you guys.

12:45.743 --> 12:48.644
Man, we should
do this more often.

12:48.646 --> 12:51.046
Come over to get laptops
back from you?

12:51.048 --> 12:52.414
Totally.

12:52.416 --> 12:55.084
So do you have it?

12:55.086 --> 12:57.186
Of course I do.
Penny gave it to me as a gift.

12:57.188 --> 12:59.021
You don't get rid
of something like that.

13:02.293 --> 13:04.626
Huh.

13:04.628 --> 13:06.862
All right, I'm sorry
I gave away your stupid laptop.

13:06.864 --> 13:09.732
You should be. We were broken
up for, like, five minutes.

13:09.734 --> 13:10.699
Are you guys fighting?

13:10.701 --> 13:11.867
Yeah.
No.

13:11.869 --> 13:13.035
Are you fighting about

13:13.037 --> 13:14.303
whether or not you're fighting?

13:14.305 --> 13:15.604
'Cause I've had
that fight before.

13:15.606 --> 13:18.240
Turns out we were,
and I lost.

13:18.242 --> 13:20.376
Leonard thinks when we broke up,
it didn't bother me.

13:20.378 --> 13:21.744
ZACK:
That's crazy.

13:21.746 --> 13:24.380
When we were going out, she used
to talk about you all the time.

13:24.382 --> 13:26.215
In fact, I think
she only dated me

13:26.217 --> 13:29.485
because I reminded her of you.

13:32.256 --> 13:35.057
Sure.

13:35.059 --> 13:37.092
Because we're both...

13:37.094 --> 13:39.128
people?

13:39.130 --> 13:41.096
Damn right we are.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.434
Oh, also, there was that video
about how much she missed you.

13:45.436 --> 13:48.103
What video?
The one on the laptop.

13:48.105 --> 13:52.174
I didn't mean to invade your
privacy, but I am a huge snoop.

13:52.176 --> 13:54.109
Ask my neighbor.
She'll tell you.

13:54.111 --> 13:56.345
But not right now;
she's in the shower.

14:01.018 --> 14:02.751
(clears throat)

14:04.855 --> 14:06.989
(slurring):
Hello, Leonard.

14:06.991 --> 14:10.492
I was gonna write you an e-mail,
but I'm a little drunk,

14:10.494 --> 14:14.763
and spelling is
a sober person's game, so...

14:16.967 --> 14:20.102
I feel I owe you a 'splanation.

14:20.104 --> 14:22.771
I-- I'm sorry.

14:22.773 --> 14:24.873
A 'splanation.

14:24.875 --> 14:26.175
(knock on door)

14:26.177 --> 14:28.210
SHELDON:
Penny. (knocking) Penny.

14:28.212 --> 14:29.344
(knocking) Penny.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.413
Sheldon, go away.
I'm making a video.

14:31.415 --> 14:32.581
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:32.583 --> 14:34.583
I'll come back
when you're alone.

14:34.585 --> 14:37.286
No, no, no.
I am alone.

14:37.288 --> 14:39.788
I'm just telling Leonard
why I broke up with him.

14:39.790 --> 14:41.356
Oh, he knows.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.791
The video I want to see

14:42.793 --> 14:45.260
is why you went out with him
in the first place.

14:45.262 --> 14:48.330
I went out with him
because he's great.

14:48.332 --> 14:50.399
And if I kept
going out with him,

14:50.401 --> 14:51.867
I probably would've married him,

14:51.869 --> 14:53.569
and that's
a little scary

14:53.571 --> 14:55.604
because I just don't think
I'm ready for that.

14:55.606 --> 15:00.609
You know, plus I have got to
learn how to spell Hofstadter.

15:00.611 --> 15:02.077
I-I know there's
a "D" in there,

15:02.079 --> 15:06.515
but it keeps moving
every time I try and write it.

15:06.517 --> 15:08.884
Sheldon, what do I do?

15:08.886 --> 15:12.654
Try to pass out facedown, so you
don't choke on your vomit.

15:13.557 --> 15:16.925
I am not
gonna pass out.

15:16.927 --> 15:20.062
But thank you anyway.

15:24.668 --> 15:26.902
Wow.
I know.

15:26.904 --> 15:29.905
There's, like, two more hours
of her just lying there.

15:32.476 --> 15:35.777
Aw, you love me
so much.

15:35.779 --> 15:38.046
I married you,
jackass.

15:38.048 --> 15:40.315
I... I know, and not
just out of pity

15:40.317 --> 15:43.519
like everyone said
in their wedding toast.

15:43.521 --> 15:45.454
You want to see the part
where she falls off the chair?

15:45.456 --> 15:47.155
No.
Totally.

15:54.298 --> 15:55.531
(thud)

15:58.736 --> 16:01.803
That's my wife.

16:01.805 --> 16:04.406
I got to see that again.

16:05.543 --> 16:09.044
Got the laptop.
Hand it here.

16:09.046 --> 16:10.946
Oh, this is
so exciting!

16:10.948 --> 16:13.482
Hey, when we sell the Bitcoin,
are you gonna pay your dad back

16:13.484 --> 16:15.284
all the money you took from him
over the years?

16:15.286 --> 16:18.620
Never even
crossed my mind.

16:18.622 --> 16:21.023
Okay, here's
the Bitcoin folder.

16:21.025 --> 16:22.724
Yeah, how much
is in there?

16:24.028 --> 16:25.994
It's empty.

16:25.996 --> 16:27.496
What?
Th-That's impossible.

16:27.498 --> 16:30.365
(stammers)
Do you think Zack stole it?

16:30.367 --> 16:32.634
No, he doesn't know
how to steal Bitcoin.

16:32.636 --> 16:34.836
I mean, he waves at trucks.

16:37.474 --> 16:40.609
Hmm...
who could it have been?

16:42.179 --> 16:44.680
Sheldon,
what did you do?

16:44.682 --> 16:46.248
I plotted my revenge.

16:46.250 --> 16:50.218
If you get a dish,
I'll serve you some cold.

16:50.220 --> 16:53.021
What, y-you stole
our Bitcoin?

16:53.023 --> 16:54.056
Oh, calm down.

16:54.058 --> 16:56.024
All I did was sneak
onto your computer

16:56.026 --> 16:58.794
and download your Bitcoin
onto a flash drive.

16:58.796 --> 17:00.228
What?

17:00.230 --> 17:01.196
I'm not keeping it.

17:01.198 --> 17:03.265
I just wanted
to watch you sweat.

17:03.267 --> 17:04.800
If you want to watch
him sweat,

17:04.801 --> 17:07.336
walk up a flight
of stairs with him.

17:09.138 --> 17:13.342
I've waited seven long years,
but it finally happened.

17:13.344 --> 17:14.710
Where's our money?

17:14.712 --> 17:16.144
That's the best part.

17:16.146 --> 17:19.915
It's on the Batman flash drive
on your key chain.

17:19.916 --> 17:22.117
You've had it
in your pocket all along.

17:25.255 --> 17:27.756
Sheldon...

17:27.758 --> 17:30.659
I lost that key chain years ago.

17:34.231 --> 17:37.099
Really?

17:37.101 --> 17:40.669
D-D-Did you look under things?

17:42.973 --> 17:46.174
Well, that is unfortunate.

17:46.176 --> 17:48.810
I guess we've all learned
a lesson today.

17:50.714 --> 17:52.180
What was the lesson?

17:52.182 --> 17:53.515
I don't know.

18:01.517 --> 18:04.851
STUART:
<i>Huh. What's that?</i>

18:05.243 --> 18:09.913
<i>Ooh, Batman flash drive.</i>

18:09.915 --> 18:12.715
<i>Pretty cool.</i>

18:12.717 --> 18:14.617
<i>Huh, if I erase this,</i>

18:14.619 --> 18:18.688
<i>I could probably resell it</i>
<i>for, like, ten bucks.</i>

18:18.690 --> 18:20.723
<i>Things are finally</i>
<i>going my way.</i>
