WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.203
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.203 --> 00:03.374
SUSAN DISCOVERED THAT PORTER

00:03.374 --> 00:06.137
WAS THE FATHER OF JULIE'S BABY.

00:06.137 --> 00:07.538
NO, THE FATHER WILL BE
AN ADOPTIVE PARENT

00:07.538 --> 00:08.639
WHO HAS GONE THROUGH
EXTENSIVE INTERVIEWS

00:08.639 --> 00:10.611
AND A BACKGROUND CHECK.
 BOTH OF YOU, STOP.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.443
I WANNA KEEP IT.

00:12.443 --> 00:14.115
THEN LYNETTE FOUND OUT...

00:14.115 --> 00:16.787
NO, NO, NO!
HE CAN'T BE HAVING A BABY!

00:16.787 --> 00:19.290
GABY TOOK IN A HOUSEGUEST...

00:19.290 --> 00:21.152
KAREN KICKED ME OUT.

00:21.152 --> 00:23.394
AND KAREN GOT BAD NEWS.

00:23.394 --> 00:24.625
THE CANCER'S BACK.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.398
BEN'S MONEY PROBLEMS
TOOK A TOLL...

00:27.398 --> 00:29.330
LET'S GET YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.661
AND RENEE STEPPED IN.

00:30.661 --> 00:32.203
NORMALLY,
I'D NEVER TAKE A CHECK,

00:32.203 --> 00:34.165
BUT I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.

00:34.165 --> 00:35.306
ORSON RETURNED...

00:35.306 --> 00:38.139
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT
A CHANGE OF SCENERY--MAINE?

00:38.139 --> 00:39.810
WITH A PLAN.

00:39.810 --> 00:42.173
YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHERE
IT'S GOING TO END UP.

00:48.179 --> 00:50.381
(Mary Alice) WHEN IT CAME
TO RAISING HER CHILDREN,

00:50.381 --> 00:55.186
LYNETTE SCAVO WAS USED
TO DOING THINGS WITHOUT HELP.

00:55.186 --> 00:58.789
HER HUSBAND WOULD OFTEN
TRAVEL ON BUSINESS...

01:01.192 --> 01:04.834
OR RUSH OUT
TO IMPORTANT MEETINGS...

01:06.797 --> 01:11.102
OR SNEAK OUT
FOR A GAME OF GOLF.

01:13.604 --> 01:15.306
BUT JUST BECAUSE LYNETTE

01:15.306 --> 01:18.078
WAS USED TO DOING EVERYTHING
HERSELF...

01:18.078 --> 01:21.252
YOU DONE YET?

01:21.252 --> 01:23.814
DIDN'T MEAN SHE LIKED IT.

01:23.814 --> 01:25.556
YES, I'M DONE.

01:25.556 --> 01:28.119
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

01:28.119 --> 01:31.162
OKAY, UH, I WANNA THANK YOU BOTH
FOR JOINING ME.

01:31.162 --> 01:34.325
I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT MY
DECISION TO BE A SINGLE FATHER.

01:34.325 --> 01:37.868
NO, NOT WORRIED. MORE LIKE
PANICKED AND TERRIFIED.

01:37.868 --> 01:41.272
WELL, I'M HERE TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT AS OF TODAY,

01:41.272 --> 01:43.204
I'VE GOT EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.175
I GOT A JOB.

01:44.175 --> 01:45.506
WOW!

01:45.506 --> 01:47.438
JUST WORKING IN A RESTAURANT,
BUT IT'S DECENT PAY,

01:47.438 --> 01:49.840
AND THERE'S HEALTH INSURANCE
FOR ME AND THE BABY.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.612
WELL, THAT IS GREAT NEWS.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.545
L-LYNETTE, DON'T YOU WANT TO
TELL OUR SON THAT'S GREAT NEWS?

01:54.545 --> 01:56.217
I'M WAITING FOR THE "BUT."

01:56.217 --> 01:58.149
THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
A "BUT."

01:58.149 --> 02:00.391
IT'S PORTER.
THERE'S ALWAYS A "BUT."

02:00.391 --> 02:04.295
BUT... THEY DON'T EXACTLY
PROVIDE CHILD CARE.

02:04.295 --> 02:05.756
AT A RESTAURANT?
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

02:05.756 --> 02:07.258
THEY USUALLY HAVE
A WHOLE PLAY AREA

02:07.258 --> 02:10.130
BETWEEN THE KNIFE BLOCK
AND THE DEEP FRYER.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.802
SO I'LL NEED A LITTLE HELP
WITH THE BABY.

02:11.802 --> 02:13.404
HOW MUCH HELP?

02:13.404 --> 02:16.237
I DON'T KNOW. EIGHT HOURS...

02:16.237 --> 02:18.769
A DAY...
EVERY DAY UNTIL...

02:18.769 --> 02:21.242
SHE TURNS 18?

02:21.242 --> 02:22.743
NO. (sighs)

02:22.743 --> 02:25.446
SHE COULD BE SUPER SMART AND END
UP GOING TO COLLEGE AT 15.

02:25.446 --> 02:28.649
AW, SWEETIE,
SHE'S NOT GONNA BE SUPER SMART.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.181
LYNETTE.

02:30.181 --> 02:33.224
PORTER, I'M SORRY.
I AM NOT GONNA KEEP TELLING YOU

02:33.224 --> 02:35.186
WHAT A BAD IDEA
RAISING THIS BABY IS.

02:35.186 --> 02:37.488
YOU'RE A GROWNUP AND YOU'VE MADE
YOUR OWN DECISION,

02:37.488 --> 02:40.591
AND I'M EVEN STARTING
TO MAKE MY PEACE WITH IT.

02:40.591 --> 02:41.762
BUT?

02:41.762 --> 02:44.735
BUT I CAN'T RAISE HER FOR YOU.

02:44.735 --> 02:48.339
WE--WE--WE CAN BARELY TAKE CARE
OF THIS ONE.
 YEAH.

02:48.339 --> 02:50.901
WAIT. WAIT.
WHERE--WHERE DID SHE GO?

02:50.901 --> 02:52.243
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
WATCHING HER.

02:52.243 --> 02:54.345
WELL, IT'S YOUR HOUSE.
 WELL... (scoffs)

02:54.345 --> 02:56.777
I'M SORRY. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
MAKE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

02:56.777 --> 02:57.948
I FOUND HER!

02:57.948 --> 03:00.251
WOW. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING,

03:00.251 --> 03:02.783
EXPECTING YOU TO CARE
ABOUT MY BABY.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.385
I MEAN, YOU'RE ONLY
THE GRANDMOTHER.

03:04.385 --> 03:05.556
UH-OH.

03:05.556 --> 03:06.717
(Paige fusses)

03:06.717 --> 03:09.320
(grunts)

03:09.320 --> 03:12.393
I AM HAPPY TO BE
HER GRANDMOTHER.

03:12.393 --> 03:15.366
I WILL FILL HER ROOM
WITH STUFFED ANIMALS.

03:15.366 --> 03:17.197
I WILL FEED HER ICE CREAM
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.969
I WILL SPOIL HER
LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS.

03:18.969 --> 03:21.472
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO
THE HEAVY LIFTING, I AM DONE.

03:21.472 --> 03:22.773
(whines)

03:22.773 --> 03:24.575
OR WILL BE VERY SHORTLY.

03:24.575 --> 03:27.338
OKAY.
I SEE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.

03:27.338 --> 03:29.580
(inhales deeply) I GUESS
I'LL HAVE TO FIND SOME STRANGER

03:29.580 --> 03:33.414
TO WATCH OVER
LITTLE BABY LYNETTE.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.886
(voice breaks) LYNETTE?

03:35.886 --> 03:39.290
YOU WERE GONNA NAME
YOUR DAUGHTER AFTER ME?

03:39.290 --> 03:42.293
THAT IS INCREDIBLY TOUCHING.

03:42.293 --> 03:43.954
IT CHANGES NOTHING.

03:43.954 --> 03:47.898
YES, LYNETTE SCAVO
HAD RAISED HER CHILDREN

03:47.898 --> 03:49.960
WITHOUT MUCH HELP...

03:49.960 --> 03:51.962
HERE YOU GO. PRACTICE.

03:51.962 --> 03:56.307
AND SHE WAS DETERMINED
THAT PORTER DO THE SAME.

04:08.579 --> 04:11.582
ORSON HODGE HAD A PLAN.

04:13.484 --> 04:18.358
HE WAS DETERMINED TO RECLAIM
THE HEART OF A WOMAN...

04:19.790 --> 04:23.263
WHOSE LOSS
HE HAD NEVER GOTTEN OVER.

04:25.035 --> 04:31.802
HE LOVED HER SO DEEPLY THAT
HE WAS WILLING TO BE PATIENT...

04:31.802 --> 04:35.876
AND OBSESS OVER EVERY DETAIL

04:35.876 --> 04:39.980
UNTIL AT LAST,
THE MOMENT ARRIVED

04:39.980 --> 04:43.754
WHEN SHE WAS JUST WITHIN REACH.

04:43.754 --> 04:46.016
OKAY, OPEN.

04:46.016 --> 04:47.518
WHAT IS THIS?

04:47.518 --> 04:48.719
IT'S A LITTLE BOOK
OF INSPIRATION

04:48.719 --> 04:51.592
I PUT TOGETHER FOR YOU.
 (gasps) OH!

04:51.592 --> 04:55.366
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU SOME
PICTURES OF MY COTTAGE IN MAINE.

04:55.366 --> 04:57.768
IT'S RIGHT ON THE COAST. LOOK.
SEE? THERE'S THE LIGHTHOUSE.

04:57.768 --> 05:00.801
OH! THESE PHOTOGRAPHS
ARE BREATHTAKING.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.673
IT'S EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL
IN PERSON,

05:02.673 --> 05:05.476
WHEN YOU HEAR THE FOGHORN
AND YOU... (inhales deeply)

05:05.476 --> 05:07.578
YOU BREATHE IN THE SEA AIR.

05:07.578 --> 05:10.711
OH, I FEEL IT ALREADY. HMM.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.384
OH, ORSON, I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW HAPPY THIS MAKES ME.

05:13.384 --> 05:15.315
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
I NEED RIGHT NOW.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.317
ABSOLUTELY.
YOU DESERVE A BREAK

05:17.317 --> 05:19.850
AFTER ALL THAT GHASTLY BUSINESS
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH LATELY.

05:19.850 --> 05:21.952
YEAH, THE MURDER,
THE INVESTIGATION,

05:21.952 --> 05:24.455
ALL THOSE CHILLING LETTERS
YOU RECEIVED.

05:24.455 --> 05:26.096
(sighs)

05:26.096 --> 05:27.628
LETTERS?

05:27.628 --> 05:29.600
YES, THE LETTER YOU RECEIVED
AFTER THE MURDER

05:29.600 --> 05:31.562
AND THE ONE AFTER
CHUCK VANCE WAS KILLED.

05:33.604 --> 05:37.468
(whispers) I NEVER TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE SECOND LETTER.

05:39.370 --> 05:42.513
THAT'S RIGHT.
I HEARD ABOUT IT FROM LYNETTE.

05:42.513 --> 05:44.475
YOU TALKED TO LYNETTE
ABOUT THE LETTERS?

05:44.475 --> 05:48.449
YES. THE OTHER DAY, WHEN SHE
CAME OVER WITH THE GIRLS.

05:48.449 --> 05:51.522
PERSONALLY, I THOUGHT IT WAS
VERY INDISCREET OF HER,

05:51.522 --> 05:53.424
BUT, WELL...

05:53.424 --> 05:56.427
YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW
THOSE WOMEN CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

06:00.130 --> 06:02.463
OH, LET ME SHOW YOU
THIS ONE.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.434
IT'S MY FAVORITE.

06:03.434 --> 06:04.665
(laughs)

06:04.665 --> 06:06.867
THAT PATCH OF DIRT
IS YOUR FAVORITE?

06:06.867 --> 06:10.571
FRESH-TILLED SOIL
IN A RAISED BED,

06:10.571 --> 06:12.372
OVERLOOKING THE OCEAN.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.445
THE PERFECT PLACE
FOR YOU TO PLANT A GARDEN.

06:14.445 --> 06:17.748
OH, ORSON, I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHEN I'VE BEEN THIS EXCITED.

06:17.748 --> 06:20.411
(sighs)
 (closes book)

06:20.411 --> 06:23.053
YOU HAVE TRULY THOUGHT
OF EVERYTHING, HAVEN'T YOU?

06:23.053 --> 06:25.886
LET'S HOPE SO, DARLING.

06:28.559 --> 06:30.390
(man on TV) AND OUR
DOPPLER RADAR WILL BE TRACKING

06:30.390 --> 06:31.662
THOSE SCATTERED SHOWERS

06:31.662 --> 06:33.794
AS THEY MOVE
FROM EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA

06:33.794 --> 06:36.396
RIGHT INTO
THE WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA AREA.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.428
NOW WHEN WE COME--

06:37.428 --> 06:38.569
(turns off TV)
 HEY!

06:38.569 --> 06:41.532
I COULD HEAR THAT
AT THE STORE!

06:41.532 --> 06:43.934
OH, NO. ONE OF YOUR GIRLS
HAVING A BIRTHDAY?

06:43.934 --> 06:46.106
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THEM
ON CAKE.

06:46.106 --> 06:49.910
NO. THIS IS FOR CARLOS.
HE'S COMING HOME THURSDAY.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.814
YOU GOT A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE
FOR A GUY GETTING OUT OF REHAB?

06:53.814 --> 06:55.916
WHAT, THEY WERE ALL OUT
OF OPIUM?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.117
NO, THIS IS FOR ME.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.190
THIS WHOLE REHAB THING
HAS BEEN VERY STRESSFUL.

07:00.190 --> 07:04.655
SO THIS IS HIS BIG HOMECOMING,
WATCHING YOU GET LOADED?

07:04.655 --> 07:06.897
AND A BALLOON.

07:06.897 --> 07:09.560
THAT GUY PUTS UP WITH A LOT
FROM YOU.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.532
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

07:11.532 --> 07:13.804
WHY DON'T YOU THINK
OF SOMEONE OTHER THAT YOURSELF

07:13.804 --> 07:16.537
JUST ONCE IN YOUR LIFE?

07:16.537 --> 07:18.669
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S HORRIBLE HERE.

07:18.669 --> 07:20.571
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
WALK OUT THE FRONT DOOR?

07:20.571 --> 07:23.443
BELIEVE ME, I WOULD
IF I HAD ANYPLACE ELSE TO GO.

07:23.443 --> 07:27.478
WELL, AS THE BALLOON TELLS US,
CARLOS IS COMING HOME SOON.

07:27.478 --> 07:28.719
SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

07:28.719 --> 07:30.881
I THOUGHT WE'D WATCH
THE BASKETBALL GAME,

07:30.881 --> 07:32.452
MAYBE DO A LITTLE GRILLING.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.885
CARLOS ALWAYS LIKED
MY TRI-TIP.

07:34.885 --> 07:38.128
WELL, YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
LIKES YOUR TRI-TIP? KAREN.

07:38.128 --> 07:39.730
YEAH, SHE DOES.

07:39.730 --> 07:42.493
I'M TALKING ABOUT STEAK, ROY!

07:42.493 --> 07:44.595
ISN'T IT TIME
YOU TWO PATCHED THINGS UP?

07:44.595 --> 07:46.567
SEND HER SOME FLOWERS.
MAKE NICE.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.698
I TRIED ALL THAT.

07:47.698 --> 07:51.171
IF SHE WANTS ME BACK,
SHE KNOWS WHERE TO FIND ME.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.044
(turns on TV)
 (man) NOW AFTER THE BREAK,

07:54.044 --> 07:55.946
WE'LL ANSWER
ALL YOUR BURNING QUESTIONS

07:55.946 --> 07:59.580
ABOUT BAROMETRIC PRESSURE,
SO MAKE SURE YOU STICK AROUND.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.982
HOW'D IT GO WITH JULIE?

08:01.982 --> 08:03.854
MADE IT TO THE TRAIN
WITH TIME TO SPARE.

08:03.854 --> 08:06.517
I THINK SHE WAS EAGER
TO GET BACK TO SCHOOL.

08:06.517 --> 08:08.559
AH. I WAS SORT OF HOPING
SHE'D CHANGE HER MIND

08:08.559 --> 08:09.820
AND COME BACK WITH YOU.

08:09.820 --> 08:12.062
"GUESS WHAT, MOM?
I DECIDED TO STAY."

08:12.062 --> 08:14.795
WELL, GIVE HER SOME TIME.
YOU NEVER KNOW.

08:14.795 --> 08:17.628
I THINK I KNOW.

08:24.575 --> 08:27.007
(sighs)

08:27.007 --> 08:28.679
PORTER?

08:28.679 --> 08:31.542
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

08:31.542 --> 08:35.515
NO. EVERYTHING PRETTY MUCH
SUCKS.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.687
I THOUGHT I HAD A JOB,

08:36.687 --> 08:39.850
BUT MY MOM SAYS
IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

08:39.850 --> 08:41.922
SO I WROTE UP A RESUME.

08:43.994 --> 08:45.726
WELL, THIS LOOKS GREAT.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.828
I MEAN, ANY BOSS
WOULD BE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.901
I MEAN, YOU'RE YOUNG,
ENERGETIC.

08:50.901 --> 08:52.532
YOU HAD A PAPER ROUTE

08:52.532 --> 08:55.105
AND YOU'RE "PROFICIENT
IN MARTIAL ARTS,"

08:55.105 --> 08:57.708
THOUGH NOT PROFICIENT
IN SPELLING IT.

08:57.708 --> 08:59.209
(chuckles)

08:59.209 --> 09:01.872
WHAT WAS THE JOB THAT YOUR MOM
SAID WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH?

09:01.872 --> 09:04.014
WAITING TABLES
AT THE CARLYLE.

09:04.014 --> 09:05.175
OH.

09:05.175 --> 09:07.277
I MEAN, I KNOW IT SOUNDS
KINDA LAME,

09:07.277 --> 09:08.619
BUT IT'S A STEPPING-STONE.

09:08.619 --> 09:12.853
I'D TAKE CLASSES,
LEARN ABOUT THE BUSINESS...

09:12.853 --> 09:14.825
TRY TO WORK MY WAY
INTO MANAGEMENT.

09:14.825 --> 09:17.858
OR EVEN OWN MY OWN RESTAURANT,
JUST LIKE MY PARENTS USED TO.

09:17.858 --> 09:21.592
WOW, PORTER, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
AN ACTUAL PLAN,

09:21.592 --> 09:22.763
AND A GOOD ONE.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.995
YEAH.
THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM.

09:24.995 --> 09:26.767
IT DOESN'T HAVE DAY CARE.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.643
YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT JOB.

09:32.643 --> 09:34.574
WHAT WILL I DO
WITH THE BABY?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.847
WELL, LUCKY FOR YOU,
YOU HAPPEN TO BE LOOKING

09:36.847 --> 09:40.651
AT FAIRVIEW'S FINEST
DAY CARE PROVIDER.

09:42.613 --> 09:45.315
PORTER, ME. I'M THE DAY CARE.

09:45.315 --> 09:46.787
OH!
 (laughs)

09:46.787 --> 09:48.288
WHEN THE BABY IS BORN,

09:48.288 --> 09:51.061
YOU JUST DROP HER OFF WITH ME
WHENEVER YOU NEED.

09:51.061 --> 09:52.793
I WILL SPOIL THE HECK
OUT OF HER.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.626
YOU DON'T MIND BEING STUCK
WITH A BABY ALL DAY?

09:55.626 --> 09:57.998
IT'S A BABY.
WHO COULD BE STUCK?

09:57.998 --> 09:59.830
MY MOTHER, FOR ONE.

09:59.830 --> 10:01.972
WELL, FOR ME,
IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE.

10:01.972 --> 10:04.905
HONESTLY, YOU WOULD
BE DOING ME A FAVOR.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.877
WOW.

10:06.877 --> 10:09.079
THANK YOU, MRS. DELFINO.

10:09.079 --> 10:12.142
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE GONNA
BE RAISING MY DAUGHTER'S CHILD.

10:12.142 --> 10:14.685
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU STARTED CALLING ME "SUSAN."

10:14.685 --> 10:16.887
OR BETTER YET, "GRANDMA."

10:16.887 --> 10:20.120
(laughs) NO. SUSAN.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.765
(grunts)

10:34.765 --> 10:36.206
(pants)

10:36.206 --> 10:38.669
(whispers) AAH! SON OF A BITCH!

10:40.811 --> 10:42.813
(door opens)
 AAH!

10:42.813 --> 10:44.875
OH!
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:44.875 --> 10:48.048
I... JUST NOTICED
YOU HAD SOME FLOWERS DELIVERED,

10:48.048 --> 10:50.650
AND I WAS SNOOPING TO SEE
WHO THEY WERE FROM.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.853
YOU WANNA KNOW WHO?
 NO.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.926
(gasps) THEY'RE FROM ROY!
HE WANTS YOU BACK!

10:55.926 --> 10:59.129
I JUST SAW YOU CUTTING
THOSE ROSES FROM BREE'S GARDEN.

10:59.129 --> 11:02.833
NO, YOU DIDN'T. YOU'RE OLD.
YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

11:02.833 --> 11:04.164
YOU'VE GOT CLIPPERS
IN YOUR POCKET.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.336
YOU HAVE CLIPPERS
IN YOUR POCKET!

11:06.336 --> 11:07.938
YOUR FINGER'S BLEEDING.

11:07.938 --> 11:10.901
YOUR FINGER'S BL--
ALL RIGHT, CAN I JUST COME IN?

11:12.743 --> 11:14.705
COME ON.

11:14.705 --> 11:17.177
LOOK, ROY MAY BE TOO PROUD
TO SEND FLOWERS HIMSELF,

11:17.177 --> 11:18.949
BUT HE MISSES YOU.

11:18.949 --> 11:20.110
WHATEVER.

11:20.110 --> 11:21.712
WHY ARE YOU BEING LIKE THIS?

11:21.712 --> 11:23.313
JUST GET OVER YOUR SILLY FIGHT
AND TAKE HIM BACK.

11:23.313 --> 11:25.355
HE'S CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

11:25.355 --> 11:29.059
REALLY? THEN HOW COME
YOU'RE OVER HERE AND NOT HIM?

11:29.059 --> 11:31.822
'CAUSE I'M KINDA TO BLAME
FOR THIS?

11:31.822 --> 11:33.293
(sighs)

11:33.293 --> 11:35.195
I FED THE FLAMES
OF YOUR LITTLE SPAT

11:35.195 --> 11:37.127
BECAUSE, LET'S FACE IT,
I'M SELFISH.

11:37.127 --> 11:39.099
MY GIRLS WERE OUT OF CONTROL,

11:39.099 --> 11:42.232
AND ROY'S A GENIUS
AT SCARING THE CRAP OUT OF KIDS.

11:42.232 --> 11:43.774
BUT NOW CARLOS
IS COMING BACK,

11:43.774 --> 11:45.705
SO I'M ALL ABOUT YOU TWO
BEING LOVEBIRDS AGAIN.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.739
SAVE YOUR BREATH, GABY.
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

11:48.739 --> 11:50.710
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU TWO?

11:50.710 --> 11:53.483
YOU KNOW,
NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS!

11:53.483 --> 11:56.716
NOW TAKE YOUR STOLEN FLOWERS
AND YOUR CLIPPERS AND...

11:56.716 --> 11:59.920
(coughing)
 KAREN, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

11:59.920 --> 12:01.451
(swallows) NOTHING.

12:01.451 --> 12:04.394
I'M ON NEW MEDICATION. SOMETIMES
I GET A LITTLE LIGHT-HEADED.

12:04.394 --> 12:05.926
YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.128
I'M--I'M GONNA GO AND LIE...
(inhales deeply)

12:08.128 --> 12:10.460
(whispers) LIE DOWN.
 KAREN!

12:10.460 --> 12:13.233
KAREN! OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!

12:13.233 --> 12:15.235
OKAY.
 (dials cell phone)

12:15.235 --> 12:17.968
HI. I NEED AN AMBULANCE
RIGHT AWAY.

12:17.968 --> 12:21.942
4358 WISTERIA LANE.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.154
(Susan) OH! (laughs)

12:34.154 --> 12:35.425
(Susan speaks indistinctly)

12:35.425 --> 12:37.127
(laughs)
 OH!

12:37.127 --> 12:41.291
(Porter and Susan
speaking indistinctly)

12:41.291 --> 12:43.763
(latch clicks)

12:43.763 --> 12:45.235
HEY, GUYS.

12:45.235 --> 12:47.097
WHATCHA DOING?

12:47.097 --> 12:48.268
UH...
 (clatter)

12:48.268 --> 12:51.071
I'M HELPING MRS. DELFINO
PAINT THE NURSERY.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.402
NURSERY?

12:52.402 --> 12:54.304
IT'S A ROOM
WHERE BABIES LIVE.

12:54.304 --> 12:57.307
YES, THANK YOU.
WHY WOULD SUSAN NEED A NURSERY?

12:57.307 --> 12:58.508
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER?

12:58.508 --> 12:59.980
UH... (sighs)

12:59.980 --> 13:01.281
I VOLUNTEERED
TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY

13:01.281 --> 13:04.184
SO PORTER COULD START
THAT NEW RESTAURANT JOB.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.056
OH.

13:06.056 --> 13:08.188
YEAH. HE SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO BE STUCK TAKING CARE OF HER

13:08.188 --> 13:10.290
ALL THE TIME,
AND I'M THRILLED TO DO IT.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.994
THAT'S... REALLY NICE OF YOU.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.195
AND OF COURSE
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING

13:15.195 --> 13:16.526
THAT YOU ARE WELCOME

13:16.526 --> 13:18.999
TO COME OVER AND PLAY ANYTIME
WITH MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.300
(chuckles)

13:20.300 --> 13:22.833
OUR GRANDDAUGHTER.

13:22.833 --> 13:25.135
UH, SORRY. (chuckles)

13:25.135 --> 13:29.009
OH, MOM. I-I WANTED TO ASK,
CAN WE TAKE THE OLD BASSINET?

13:29.009 --> 13:31.842
MY BASSINET? THE ONE ALL FIVE
OF YOU KIDS SLEPT IN?

13:31.842 --> 13:34.344
YEAH. THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT
IT WAS COOL.

13:34.344 --> 13:36.086
NOW MY KID
GETS TO SLEEP IN IT.

13:36.086 --> 13:38.318
OHH.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.021
DOESN'T IT MAKE YOU WANT TO CRY?
(chuckles)

13:42.352 --> 13:45.325
YEAH. YEAH, IT DOES.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.328
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

13:50.400 --> 13:52.332
RENEE.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.334
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:54.334 --> 13:57.337
LEARNING TEN NEW WAYS
TO COOK KALE.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.341
AND LETTING YOU KNOW YOUR
FINANCIAL TROUBLES ARE OVER.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.413
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:03.413 --> 14:05.445
I MET WITH YOUR LOAN SHARK--

14:05.445 --> 14:08.018
A SENTENCE I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE SAYING--

14:08.018 --> 14:10.080
AND I SETTLED YOUR ACCOUNT.

14:10.080 --> 14:13.483
ALL YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT NOW
IS GETTING BETTER.

14:13.483 --> 14:16.056
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO DO THAT.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.258
I THINK THE WORDS YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR ARE "THANK YOU."

14:18.258 --> 14:21.431
I'M SERIOUS. I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS.

14:21.431 --> 14:23.233
LOOK, IF YOU AND I ARE
GONNA KEEP HANGING OUT,

14:23.233 --> 14:25.435
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT ME.

14:25.435 --> 14:26.436
I DO WHAT I WANT.

14:26.436 --> 14:27.597
(magazine thuds)

14:31.341 --> 14:34.004
THANK YOU.

14:34.004 --> 14:35.175
BUT I WANT TO BE
PERFECTLY CLEAR.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.177
I-I WILL BE PAYING YOU
THAT MONEY BACK.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.508
OH, I KNOW.

14:38.508 --> 14:41.281
AND IT'S PROBABLY GONNA
TAKE A WHILE.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.613
GOOD THING I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

14:43.613 --> 14:45.385
IT COULD BE YEARS.

14:45.385 --> 14:49.459
SHH. JUST LIE THERE
AND LOOK PRETTY.

14:55.665 --> 14:57.397
(doorbell rings)

14:57.397 --> 14:59.930
UH, COME IN!

14:59.930 --> 15:01.671
AND DON'T BE AN AX MURDERER!

15:01.671 --> 15:03.073
(whispers) OH.

15:03.073 --> 15:04.334
HEY!

15:04.334 --> 15:06.206
HEY!
 HEY, KIDS, DAD'S HOME!

15:06.206 --> 15:08.338
WHAT'S GOING ON, TOM?
KINDA BUSY RIGHT NOW.

15:08.338 --> 15:10.680
ACTUALLY, THAT IS WHY I AM HERE.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.583
PARKER, PENNY, YOU GUYS AROUND?
 (descending footsteps)

15:13.583 --> 15:15.986
HEY, GUYS.
 (Penny) HEY, DAD.

15:15.986 --> 15:17.948
GO PACK YOUR BAGS.

15:17.948 --> 15:19.519
I'VE TRIED THAT, TOM.
THEY COME BACK.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.221
(chuckles) I FIGURED
I'D TAKE 'EM OFF YOUR HANDS

15:21.221 --> 15:22.993
FOR THE REST OF SPRING BREAK.
 OH, WE'RE GOING TO YOUR PLACE?

15:22.993 --> 15:24.324
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!
 COOL!

15:24.324 --> 15:25.956
AND YOU ALREADY GOT PLENTY
OF STUFF THERE ALREADY,

15:25.956 --> 15:27.127
SO PACK LIGHT!

15:27.127 --> 15:28.528
THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING?

15:28.528 --> 15:29.929
(chuckles)

15:29.929 --> 15:31.431
YOU'RE TAKING THE KIDS
FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK?

15:31.431 --> 15:33.533
WELL, UM, AFTER OUR TALK
WITH PORTER,

15:33.533 --> 15:36.436
I GOT TO THINKING THAT YOU NEVER
REALLY GET ANY TIME TO YOURSELF.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.069
AND WHEN I WAS OUT OF TOWN,
YOU HAD THE KIDS FOR WEEKS.

15:39.069 --> 15:41.941
SO... I OWE YA.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.413
WOW!

15:43.413 --> 15:46.416
IF WE WEREN'T SEPARATED,
THE THINGS I'D DO TO YOU...

15:48.478 --> 15:51.381
ANYWAY, UH, THANK YOU.

15:51.381 --> 15:53.483
IT'LL BE MUCH EASIER GETTING
THINGS DONE AROUND HERE

15:53.483 --> 15:55.955
WHEN IT'S JUST
ME AND THE BABY.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.128
NO, NO, NO.
I'M TAKING PAIGE, TOO.

15:58.128 --> 16:00.630
WELL, WHO'S GONNA WATCH HER
WHILE YOU'RE AT WORK?

16:00.630 --> 16:04.094
JANE.

16:04.094 --> 16:06.266
SHE HASN'T TAKEN CARE OF A BABY
IN FOREVER.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.438
SHE'S--SHE'S REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

16:08.438 --> 16:10.700
OKAY, THAT'S REALLY GENEROUS.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.743
(descending footsteps)
 AND HERE COMES THE HERD.

16:13.743 --> 16:15.375
(Parker) LATER, MOM.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.377
WAIT, WAIT. GIVE ME A HUG.

16:17.377 --> 16:18.708
BYE.
 ALL RIGHT. LOVE YOU.

16:18.708 --> 16:20.080
HAVE A GOOD TIME.
I LOVE YOU.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.052
HAVE A GOOD TIME. MWAH!
 I LOVE YOU, MOM.

16:22.052 --> 16:23.213
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

16:23.213 --> 16:25.585
(Tom chuckles)
 (chuckles)

16:27.287 --> 16:29.359
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH ALL THIS TIME TO YOURSELF?

16:29.359 --> 16:31.691
OH, THAT IS A PROBLEM
I LOOK FORWARD TO SOLVING.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.363
(chuckles)

16:33.363 --> 16:36.366
BYE, PAIGE. THANK YOU!

16:47.407 --> 16:49.539
I SPOKE WITH YOUR DOCTOR,
AND I KNOW.

16:49.539 --> 16:51.641
WHAT?

16:51.641 --> 16:55.145
DOCTORS AREN'T ALLOWED TO TALK
ABOUT PATIENTS' CONDITIONS.

16:55.145 --> 16:57.117
WELL, THEY CAN IF
YOU'RE FAMILY, MOM.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.449
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ANYONE
THE CANCER'S BACK?

16:59.449 --> 17:01.020
(inhales deeply)

17:01.020 --> 17:03.523
BECAUSE THIS TIME,
I AIN'T GONNA BEAT IT.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.425
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

17:05.425 --> 17:08.627
YEAH, I DO.

17:11.501 --> 17:13.433
(whispers) OH.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.665
SO THIS WHY YOU'VE BEEN
PUSHING ROY AWAY.

17:15.665 --> 17:18.768
LOOK AT MY SMART DAUGHTER,
PIECING IT TOGETHER. (chuckles)

17:18.768 --> 17:20.640
HE DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT ANY OF IT?

17:20.640 --> 17:23.512
NO, AND HE'S NOT GOING TO.

17:23.512 --> 17:26.516
BUT THIS IS A SCARY THING. MAYBE
YOU SHOULD LET HIM HELP YOU.

17:26.516 --> 17:28.478
WHY, SO HE CAN
BE MISERABLE, TOO?

17:28.478 --> 17:29.519
KAREN!

17:29.519 --> 17:32.552
ROY WENT THROUGH THIS
WHEN HIS FIRST WIFE DIED.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.225
I'M NOT PUTTING HIM THROUGH IT
AGAIN.

17:35.225 --> 17:39.229
GABY, I'M BEGGING YOU.

17:39.229 --> 17:41.591
DON'T DO THIS TO HIM.

17:41.591 --> 17:44.434
JUST DON'T TELL HIM.

17:44.434 --> 17:47.537
(sighs)

17:52.142 --> 17:53.473
OH! YOU KNOW WHAT
WE NEED HERE?

17:53.473 --> 17:56.276
OVER THE CRIB, A MOBILE
WITH TWINKLY LITTLE BUTTERFLIES.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.108
THOSE WERE JULIE'S FAVORITE.

17:58.108 --> 18:00.550
TWINKLY BUTTERFLIES.
 OOH!

18:00.550 --> 18:03.453
AND, YOU KNOW, WE COULD
PUT HER NAME ON THE WALL

18:03.453 --> 18:05.655
IN BIG, BRIGHT LETTERS.

18:05.655 --> 18:06.856
DO YOU HAVE A NAME YET?

18:06.856 --> 18:09.389
I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING
ABOUT "LYNETTE."

18:09.389 --> 18:11.121
FOR A BABY?

18:11.121 --> 18:12.392
HUH.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.763
LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT.

18:13.763 --> 18:15.525
OH! YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
WE COULD DO?

18:15.525 --> 18:18.468
A MURAL. LIKE, WINNIE THE POOH,

18:18.468 --> 18:21.701
AND HIS HEAD IS STUCK
IN THE HONEY POT. (laughs)

18:21.701 --> 18:23.573
I BROUGHT YOU GUYS
SOME COFFEE,

18:23.573 --> 18:25.104
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE
ONE OF YOU DOESN'T NEED IT.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.508
OH, I'M NOT CAFFEINATED.
I'M JUST HIGH ON BABY.

18:28.508 --> 18:29.839
IS THERE ANY SUGAR?

18:29.839 --> 18:31.711
UH, IN THE KITCHEN.

18:33.313 --> 18:36.286
(sighs) THAT BABY IS GONNA FEEL
RIGHT AT HOME HERE.

18:36.286 --> 18:39.149
OH, WELL, THAT'S WHY
I'M DOING THIS.

18:39.149 --> 18:42.192
UH-HUH. ARE YOU GONNA KEEP
JULIE'S BED?

18:42.192 --> 18:44.454
WELL, SHE WAS HERE FIRST.

18:44.454 --> 18:48.228
AND BESIDES, I MEAN, IF SHE--
IF SHE DOES COME BACK,

18:48.228 --> 18:49.629
SHE'LL NEED A PLACE TO STAY.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.202
RIGHT.
SO WHEN JULIE COMES TO VISIT,

18:52.202 --> 18:56.336
SHE'LL BE SLEEPING 4 FEET AWAY
FROM THE BABY SHE DOESN'T WANT.

18:56.336 --> 19:00.370
THINK I SHOULD MOVE
JULIE'S BED?

19:00.370 --> 19:03.543
I THINK YOU SHOULD DO
WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.516
(kisses)

19:06.516 --> 19:09.649
HON, DID YOU FIND THE SUGAR?

19:09.649 --> 19:12.322
THAT'S WHAT
I WAS LOOKING FOR.

19:13.823 --> 19:17.187
LETS JUST HOPE THE BABY
TAKES AFTER JULIE.

19:19.359 --> 19:22.732
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING
THAT CHAPS MY ASS.

19:22.732 --> 19:26.336
IF MARMADUKE ATE MY PILLOW,
I'D SHOOT HIM RIGHT IN THE HEAD.

19:28.538 --> 19:31.341
HEY, ROY?
 NO, GABY.

19:31.341 --> 19:34.204
I WOULDN'T ACTUALLY SHOOT A DOG.
IT WAS A JOKE.

19:35.645 --> 19:38.177
I JUST REALIZED
THE OTHER DAY,

19:38.177 --> 19:41.381
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HEARD
YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR FIRST WIFE.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.682
MIRIAM?

19:42.682 --> 19:44.514
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER NAME.

19:44.514 --> 19:47.287
MIRIAM.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.519
HOW LONG
WERE YOU GUYS MARRIED?

19:49.519 --> 19:51.190
39 YEARS.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.624
SHE DIED 2 WEEKS
BEFORE OUR 40th ANNIVERSARY.

19:54.624 --> 19:57.227
OH, MY GOD.

19:57.227 --> 19:58.568
CANCER, RIGHT?

19:58.568 --> 20:00.830
BRAIN.

20:00.830 --> 20:02.872
SON OF A BITCH, THAT KIND.

20:02.872 --> 20:05.275
A REAL SON OF A BITCH.

20:05.275 --> 20:08.538
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE WORST
THING YOU EVER WENT THROUGH.

20:09.779 --> 20:11.711
YOU'D THINK.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.644
WAIT, ARE YOU SAYING
IT WASN'T?

20:14.644 --> 20:17.287
SOUNDS WEIRD.

20:17.287 --> 20:19.519
IT--IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND.

20:23.553 --> 20:25.495
I WANNA UNDERSTAND.

20:25.495 --> 20:28.298
OKAY.

20:28.298 --> 20:30.430
WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEBODY,

20:30.430 --> 20:32.432
LOVE THEM A LONG TIME,

20:32.432 --> 20:34.604
YOU GET LAZY.

20:34.604 --> 20:38.668
YOU FIGURE THEY KNOW IT,
SO YOU STOP SAYING IT SO MUCH,

20:38.668 --> 20:40.410
STOP SHOWING IT.

20:40.410 --> 20:41.711
(whispers) YEAH.

20:41.711 --> 20:45.715
(voice breaks) BUT WHEN YOU KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE 'EM,

20:45.715 --> 20:49.419
THAT THEY WON'T BE THERE
TO HEAR YOU SAY IT...

20:49.419 --> 20:52.482
OH, BOY, YOU MAKE DAMN SURE
THEY KNOW IT

20:52.482 --> 20:54.724
EVERY SECOND OF EVERY DAY.

20:54.724 --> 20:56.986
(voice breaks)
I'M SO SORRY I BROUGHT IT UP.

20:56.986 --> 20:59.629
NAH. THESE?

20:59.629 --> 21:01.661
I EARNED 'EM.

21:01.661 --> 21:03.663
I WAS THERE FOR MIRIAM.

21:03.663 --> 21:09.439
I TOLD HER EVERYTHING
I NEEDED TO TELL HER,

21:09.439 --> 21:12.402
HELD HER HAND
WHEN SHE WAS SCARED.

21:12.402 --> 21:14.804
NAH, THESE DON'T BOTHER ME
AT ALL.

21:14.804 --> 21:16.346
(sniffles)

21:16.346 --> 21:18.378
(sighs)

21:18.378 --> 21:19.979
OH, ROY.

21:19.979 --> 21:23.653
I MADE A PROMISE TO SOMEONE,
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO BREAK IT.

21:28.718 --> 21:30.860
RENEE.

21:30.860 --> 21:33.423
IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

21:33.423 --> 21:36.766
A LOAN SHARK
 AND A JEHOVAH WITNESS?

21:36.766 --> 21:39.298
NOT A COMBO YOU SEE OFTEN.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.771
WHAT?

21:41.771 --> 21:42.932
(clears throat)

21:42.932 --> 21:44.474
I'M KIND OF EMBARRASSED
TO ADMIT THIS,

21:44.474 --> 21:46.376
BUT I'M A TERRIBLE BOOKKEEPER.

21:46.376 --> 21:49.639
THAT CHECK YOU WROTE ME TO
PAY OFF YOUR BOYFRIEND'S LOAN?

21:49.639 --> 21:51.040
I HAD THE AMOUNT WRONG.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.813
OH, SO YOU'RE HERE
TO GIVE ME A REFUND?

21:53.813 --> 21:55.815
NOT EXACTLY.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.647
I REALLY LIKE THIS HOUSE.

21:57.647 --> 22:00.049
TELL ME, WHAT DOES
FIRE INSURANCE COST

22:00.049 --> 22:01.791
FOR A PLACE LIKE THIS?

22:01.791 --> 22:04.894
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU PICK UP
YOUR VIOLIN CASE

22:04.894 --> 22:06.426
AND DRIVE
YOUR BIG CADILLAC BACK

22:06.426 --> 22:08.928
TO THE "GODFATHER" MOVIE
YOU CRAWLED OUT OF?

22:08.928 --> 22:10.860
YOU ARE NOT GONNA
INTIMIDATE ME.

22:10.860 --> 22:13.803
(chuckles)
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

22:13.803 --> 22:18.638
IT'S HOW I MAKE MY LIVING,
AND BUSINESS IS GOOD.

22:18.638 --> 22:21.371
AH, I GET IT.

22:21.371 --> 22:23.713
YOU SEE THE SWEET
SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD AND THINK,

22:23.713 --> 22:26.416
"I CAN
PUSH THOSE PEOPLE AROUND."

22:26.416 --> 22:27.517
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

22:27.517 --> 22:30.750
I DO NOT COME FROM
A PLACE LIKE THIS.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.884
YOU GOT ALL YOU'RE GONNA GET.
WE'RE DONE.

22:37.827 --> 22:40.890
I'M THE ONE THAT DECIDES
WHEN WE'RE DONE.

22:42.832 --> 22:44.794
SEE YA AROUND.

22:50.740 --> 22:52.902
(sighs)

22:52.902 --> 22:54.744
IS THAT EVERYTHING?

22:54.744 --> 22:56.776
I THINK SO.
 HAVE YOU TAKEN ONE LAST LOOK
DOWN THE LANE,

22:56.776 --> 22:58.077
FIXED AN IMAGE IN YOUR MIND?

22:58.077 --> 23:00.880
WHY? WE'LL ONLY BE GONE
FOR A MONTH.
 WILL WE?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.552
SOMETHING TELLS ME
THAT ONCE YOU TASTE

23:02.552 --> 23:04.614
ONE OF THOSE DELICIOUS
MAINE LOBSTER ROLLS,

23:04.614 --> 23:05.915
YOU'LL NEVER WANT
TO COME BACK.

23:05.915 --> 23:08.818
AREN'T WE GETTING AHEAD
OF OURSELVES?

23:08.818 --> 23:10.960
PROMISE ME YOU'LL KEEP
AN OPEN MIND.

23:10.960 --> 23:14.494
FINE. MIND OPEN.

23:15.725 --> 23:17.066
(car door closes)
 THIS IS GONNA SOUND SILLY,

23:17.066 --> 23:19.869
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M MOST EXCITED ABOUT?
 WHAT?

23:19.869 --> 23:21.901
WE FINALLY GET TO WEAR
THOSE HATS I BOUGHT

23:21.901 --> 23:24.434
FOR THAT ALASKAN CRUISE
WE NEVER GOT TO TAKE.

23:24.434 --> 23:27.737
JIMINY CHRISTMAS.
I LEFT MINE AT HOME.

23:27.737 --> 23:28.908
ORSON!

23:28.908 --> 23:30.780
WE'LL BUY ANOTHER ONE.

23:30.780 --> 23:32.882
BUT IT WON'T BE THE SAME THING.
I HAD THEM MONOGRAMMED,

23:32.882 --> 23:34.844
AND I ALWAYS IMAGINED US
WEARING THEM

23:34.844 --> 23:37.747
ON SOME WONDERFUL ADVENTURE
TOGETHER.

23:37.747 --> 23:39.088
(chuckles)
 OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

23:39.088 --> 23:41.651
WE'LL JUST STOP AND GET IT
FROM YOUR APARTMENT.

23:41.651 --> 23:43.923
(seat belt clicks)
 MY APARTMENT?

23:43.923 --> 23:45.054
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT.

23:45.054 --> 23:46.756
DON'T BE SILLY.
IT'S ON THE WAY.

23:46.756 --> 23:48.628
AND BESIDES, MOST PEOPLE
DON'T GET TO THE AIRPORT

23:48.628 --> 23:50.630
FOUR HOURS
 BEFORE THEIR FLIGHT.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.201
NO! NO, WE CAN'T.

23:52.201 --> 23:53.963
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES

23:53.963 --> 23:57.006
TO GO THROUGH SECURITY
IN A WHEELCHAIR?
 CERTAINLY NOT FOUR HOURS.

23:57.006 --> 23:58.808
BREE, PLEASE.

24:01.871 --> 24:03.913
ORSON, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

24:03.913 --> 24:05.044
(chuckles) NO. NO.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.778
YOU'RE TREMBLING.

24:08.778 --> 24:10.780
IT'S--IT'S--IT'S NOTHING.

24:10.780 --> 24:14.824
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW ME
AND PUNCTUALITY.

24:14.824 --> 24:16.185
WELL, THIS IS HARDLY
THE WAY TO START

24:16.185 --> 24:19.128
THAT RELAXING VACATION
YOU'VE BEEN PROMISING ME.

24:19.128 --> 24:21.090
(sighs)

24:21.090 --> 24:24.494
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY, DEAR.

24:24.494 --> 24:27.497
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

24:27.497 --> 24:28.738
NOW LET'S MAKE THAT

24:28.738 --> 24:31.971
THE LAST TIME WE QUIBBLE
ON THIS TRIP.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.805
NOW WE'RE OFF
TO YOUR APARTMENT.

24:35.805 --> 24:37.807
(starts engine, shifts gear)

24:51.721 --> 24:54.123
(whirring)

24:54.123 --> 24:58.227
(beeping)

24:58.227 --> 25:00.930
(plastic crinkles)

25:09.979 --> 25:11.841
(fork clatters)

25:17.016 --> 25:18.517
HI.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.219
LYNETTE, PORTER'S NOT HERE.
 NO, I KNOW.

25:20.219 --> 25:21.791
I JUST FELT BAD YOU WERE DOING
ALL THE WORK ON THE NURSERY,

25:21.791 --> 25:23.923
SO I FREED UP SOME TIME
IN MY SCHEDULE TO HELP.

25:23.923 --> 25:26.856
YOU KNOW, PAINTING, MOVING
FURNITURE, WHATEVER YOU NEED.

25:26.856 --> 25:29.198
UH, ACTUALLY, WE ALREADY
FINISHED. (chuckles)

25:29.198 --> 25:31.200
OH. CAN I SEE IT?

25:31.200 --> 25:34.734
OF COURSE. UH, SURE.
FOLLOW ME.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.608
I KNOW PINK IS
A LITTLE TRADITIONAL,

25:38.608 --> 25:39.909
BUT THEN I FOUND

25:39.909 --> 25:42.972
THIS BLACK AND WHITE BEDDING
FOR THE BASSINET I JUST LOVE.

25:42.972 --> 25:44.814
MAKES IT FEEL LIKE
A LITTLE FRENCH GIRL'S ROOM,

25:44.814 --> 25:46.045
DON'T YOU THINK?

25:46.045 --> 25:48.277
WHO'S SOPHIE?

25:50.079 --> 25:54.023
OH! UH, THAT'S WHAT PORTER
DECIDED TO NAME THE BABY.

25:54.023 --> 25:55.554
UH-HUH.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.327
PORTER DECIDED TO NAME THE BABY
AFTER YOUR MOTHER?

25:58.327 --> 26:01.891
(laughs) HE DID ASK ME
FOR SOME SUGGESTIONS.

26:01.891 --> 26:05.835
INTERESTING. HE TOLD ME
HE WAS NAMING HER LYNETTE.

26:05.835 --> 26:07.296
I KNOW, BUT...

26:07.296 --> 26:08.638
BABY LYNETTE?

26:08.638 --> 26:10.740
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

26:10.740 --> 26:14.143
OH, NOTHING. IT'S JUST,
"LYNETTE" IS SO...

26:14.143 --> 26:15.304
YOU.

26:15.304 --> 26:16.676
REALLY?

26:16.676 --> 26:18.007
WELL, YEAH.

26:18.007 --> 26:22.852
AND YOU HAVE SET THE BAR
SO HIGH ON THAT NAME.

26:22.852 --> 26:24.583
DO YOU WANT TO BURDEN
A TINY LITTLE BABY

26:24.583 --> 26:26.315
WITH TRYING
TO LIVE UP TO THAT?

26:26.315 --> 26:28.718
(chuckles)

26:28.718 --> 26:30.059
AND NOBODY THOUGHT
I'D BE INTERESTED

26:30.059 --> 26:32.692
IN HEARING
ABOUT THIS NAME CHANGE?

26:32.692 --> 26:34.864
OH, MY GOSH.

26:34.864 --> 26:36.766
ARE YOU UPSET ABOUT THIS?

26:36.766 --> 26:40.900
OH. I THOUGHT YOU WERE INTO
BEING THE HANDS-OFF GRANDMA.

26:40.900 --> 26:44.103
WELL, I'M TRYING TO GET MY SON
TO STAND ON HIS OWN TWO FEET,

26:44.103 --> 26:47.937
AND I GUESS I DIDN'T COUNT ON
YOU BEING THE PUSHY GRANDMA.

26:47.937 --> 26:50.609
(laughs) I GUESS
YOUR DEFINITION OF "PUSHY"

26:50.609 --> 26:53.012
IS BEING HELPFUL
AND WANTING TO GET INVOLVED.

26:53.012 --> 26:55.114
OH, I WANNA BE INVOLVED.
IT'S MY GRANDDAUGHTER, TOO.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.316
WELL , I DON'T SEE YOU SETTING
UP A NURSERY IN YOUR HOUSE.

26:57.316 --> 27:00.219
OH, WELL, MAYBE I WILL.
THERE'S JUST ONE THING I NEED.

27:02.652 --> 27:04.994
LYNETTE, GIVE THAT BACK!
 NO.

27:04.994 --> 27:07.927
PORTER WANTS IT HERE. HE SAYS IT
PULLS THE WHOLE ROOM TOGETHER.

27:07.927 --> 27:11.130
OH, YEAH, 'CAUSE PORTER HAS
SUCH A KEEN EYE FOR DESIGN.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.402
WHAT IS GOING ON?
WHAT'S WRONG?

27:13.402 --> 27:15.064
WHAT'S WRONG?

27:15.064 --> 27:17.867
YOU'RE CALLING LYNETTE "SOPHIE,"
YOU'RE MAKING MY SON A WAITER,

27:17.867 --> 27:19.008
AND YOU'RE TRYING
TO TURN MY GRANDDAUGHTER

27:19.008 --> 27:21.240
INTO A FRENCH GIRL.
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG!

27:21.240 --> 27:23.212
OKAY, THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE,

27:23.212 --> 27:24.974
AND IT'S INCREDIBLY PETTY.

27:24.974 --> 27:27.777
WELL, NOT AS PETTY AS TRYING
TO STEAL SOMEBODY'S GRANDCHILD!

27:27.777 --> 27:29.949
OH! (panting)

27:31.821 --> 27:33.382
(sighs)

27:37.126 --> 27:39.989
MY FIRST VISIT
TO YOUR APARTMENT.

27:39.989 --> 27:43.032
I MUST ADMIT, I'M A BIT ASHAMED
I NEVER CAME BY BEFORE.

27:43.032 --> 27:44.193
YES, WELL, TRUTH BE TOLD,

27:44.193 --> 27:46.696
I'M A BIT ASHAMED
OF HOW MODEST IT IS.

27:46.696 --> 27:49.098
SO IF IT'S ALL THE SAME, I'D
PREFER IT IF YOU WAIT OUT HERE.

27:49.098 --> 27:50.439
I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

27:50.439 --> 27:51.871
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

27:51.871 --> 27:53.743
I'M SURE
IT'S PERFECTLY CHARMING.

27:53.743 --> 27:56.105
ACTUALLY, IT'S ALSO A MESS.

27:56.105 --> 27:59.408
(chuckles) THERE, I SAID IT.
OH, WHAT YOU MUST THINK OF ME.

27:59.408 --> 28:01.180
ORSON, I KNOW YOU.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.213
A "MESS" MEANS YOU HAVEN'T
FLUFFED THE SOFA PILLOWS TODAY.

28:04.213 --> 28:06.085
NOW COME ON.
LET'S GET YOU THAT HAT.

28:06.085 --> 28:09.018
(sighs)

28:09.018 --> 28:10.990
OH, HELL'S BELLS.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.892
WHAT?
 I SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN
MY KEY.

28:12.892 --> 28:15.094
OH, DEAR.
 SOMETIMES I THINK
I'D FORGET MY HEAD

28:15.094 --> 28:17.266
IF IT WEREN'T ATTACHED
TO MY BODY.

28:17.266 --> 28:20.099
OF COURSE, THEN I WOULDN'T NEED
TO GET MY HAT.

28:20.099 --> 28:22.732
THE MANAGER HAS A MASTER KEY.

28:22.732 --> 28:25.104
WOULD YOU MIND RUNNING DOWN
TO THE OFFICE TO GET IT?

28:25.104 --> 28:29.078
OF COURSE NOT.
I'LL BE BACK IN A SEC.

28:29.078 --> 28:32.081
(keys jangling)

28:51.160 --> 28:54.463
ORSON? I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE
AND I CAN'T FIND THE MANAGER.

28:54.463 --> 28:56.365
OH, NOT TO WORRY. (sighs)

28:56.365 --> 28:58.207
I'M SUCH A MUDDLEHEAD.

28:58.207 --> 29:02.011
(keys jangling)
 I FORGOT THAT I KEEP A SPARE KEY
IN THE POUCH.

29:02.011 --> 29:03.913
IT'S ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS
ABOUT BEING IN A WHEELCHAIR.

29:03.913 --> 29:06.145
IT'S LIKE HAVING
A MOBILE PURSE.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.177
AFTER YOU.

29:12.221 --> 29:14.253
WHAT A LOVELY PLACE.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.785
(Orson chuckles)

29:15.785 --> 29:17.827
AND, OF COURSE, YOUR PILLOWS
ARE PERFECTLY PLUMPED.

29:17.827 --> 29:19.428
IT SERVED ITS PURPOSE.

29:19.428 --> 29:20.990
AND NOW...

29:20.990 --> 29:24.193
ON TO NEW ADVENTURES.

29:27.436 --> 29:29.538
(laughs)

29:29.538 --> 29:33.042
YOU LOOK VERY DASHING.
 THANK YOU.

29:33.042 --> 29:35.374
UH, LET'S NOT DILLYDALLY.

29:35.374 --> 29:38.107
WE--WE STILL HAVE A PLANE
TO CATCH.

29:40.109 --> 29:42.551
OH, WE--AND WE MUST STOP BY
A NEWSSTAND IN THE TERMINAL.

29:42.551 --> 29:46.115
THE NOVEL I'M READING
IS SIMPLY DREADFUL.

29:47.456 --> 29:50.059
OH, AND I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU DESPISE AIRPLANE FOOD.

29:50.059 --> 29:53.222
PERHAPS WE CAN PICK UP
A LITTLE BITE FOR YOU AS WELL.

29:54.994 --> 29:57.496
BREE?

30:04.874 --> 30:06.205
(whispering) IT WAS YOU?

30:08.377 --> 30:10.279
YOU DID IT?

30:10.279 --> 30:12.311
YOU WROTE THE LETTERS?

30:17.086 --> 30:19.248
OH, MY GOD.

30:19.248 --> 30:21.390
YOU KILLED CHUCK.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.593
YES.

30:27.126 --> 30:28.297
(door closes)

30:28.297 --> 30:29.458
FOR YOU.

30:29.458 --> 30:31.160
WHAT?

30:32.601 --> 30:34.263
HE WAS GOING TO ARREST YOU.

30:34.263 --> 30:36.165
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
TO STOP HIM.

30:36.165 --> 30:39.608
EVERYTHING I DID, BREE,
WAS TO PROTECT YOU.

30:39.608 --> 30:41.170
PROTECT ME?

30:41.170 --> 30:44.243
HOW WAS WRITING THE LETTERS
SUPPOSED TO PROTECT ME?

30:44.243 --> 30:46.475
THEY TORMENTED ME,
ALMOST DROVE ME TO SUICIDE.

30:46.475 --> 30:48.377
WELL, I'M SORRY IT WENT
THAT FAR.

30:48.377 --> 30:51.220
BUT I KNEW I HAD NO CHANCE
OF WINNING YOU BACK

30:51.220 --> 30:54.483
UNLESS I COULD ISOLATE YOU FROM
THOSE AWFUL FRIENDS OF YOURS.

30:54.483 --> 30:56.926
SO I WROTE THE LETTERS

30:56.926 --> 30:59.528
KNOWING THOSE WOMEN WOULD
TURN AGAINST YOU, AND THEY DID.

30:59.528 --> 31:00.960
BUT WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO TURN THEM AGAINST ME?

31:00.960 --> 31:02.431
BECAUSE AS LONG AS THEY WERE
IN YOUR LIFE,

31:02.431 --> 31:04.563
I KNEW I WOULD ALWAYS BE
A DISTANT SECOND,

31:04.563 --> 31:07.196
AND THAT WASN'T GOING
TO BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!

31:07.196 --> 31:08.898
NOT THIS TIME!

31:08.898 --> 31:11.440
I HAD TO HAVE YOU
ALL TO MYSELF.

31:11.440 --> 31:15.304
THAT'S HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU.

31:15.304 --> 31:18.207
YOU'RE INSANE.

31:18.207 --> 31:19.348
BREE.
 (sighs)

31:19.348 --> 31:21.510
BREE, WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS TO COMMIT A CRIME

31:21.510 --> 31:22.611
FOR THE GREATER GOOD.

31:22.611 --> 31:24.453
DO NOT COMPARE YOURSELF
TO ME!

31:24.453 --> 31:26.215
I WAS PROTECTING PEOPLE
I LOVE.

31:26.215 --> 31:28.887
YOU WERE ONLY PURSUING
YOUR OWN SELFISH DESIRES.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.419
NO, I DID IT FOR BOTH OF US!

31:30.419 --> 31:32.191
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME

31:32.191 --> 31:34.163
AT THE DARKEST MOMENT
OF MY LIFE.

31:34.163 --> 31:36.625
YOU'RE A SICK, PATHETIC MAN,

31:36.625 --> 31:39.328
AND I KNOW THAT SOMEDAY
YOU WILL PAY FOR YOUR SINS.

31:39.328 --> 31:42.331
BREE, DON'T GO!
YOU'RE EVERYTHING TO ME!

31:42.331 --> 31:44.603
WELL, YOU ARE NOTHING TO ME.

31:44.603 --> 31:47.236
AND I NEVER WANNA
SEE YOU AGAIN.

31:50.940 --> 31:52.181
(gasps)

31:53.682 --> 31:55.644
(whispers) OH.

32:00.449 --> 32:02.021
HEY.

32:02.021 --> 32:04.253
YOU MIND IF I COME IN?

32:04.253 --> 32:08.958
SURE, BUT I'VE ALREADY BEEN
SCREAMED AT BY ONE SCAVO TODAY,

32:08.958 --> 32:10.629
SO CAN WE KEEP IT CIVIL?

32:12.431 --> 32:14.633
IF THIS IS ABOUT SUSAN,
YOU CAN SAVE YOUR BREATH.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.165
OH, COME ON, LYNETTE.

32:16.165 --> 32:17.406
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU GUYS CARE
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

32:17.406 --> 32:18.567
UH-HUH.

32:18.567 --> 32:20.509
HEY, YOU WANNA
HAVE SEX WITH ME?

32:20.509 --> 32:22.111
THAT'D REALLY PISS HER OFF.

32:22.111 --> 32:25.514
UH, I'M GOING TO PASS ON THAT,
BUT THANKS.

32:25.514 --> 32:28.677
OKAY.

32:28.677 --> 32:30.379
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY SHE'S SO MAD AT ME.

32:30.379 --> 32:34.053
SHE SAID SHE WANTED NOTHING
TO DO WITH PORTER'S BABY.

32:34.053 --> 32:36.055
CAN I TELL YOU
A LITTLE SECRET?

32:36.055 --> 32:38.627
THAT WAS HER FIRST REACTION
TO ALL FIVE OF OUR KIDS.

32:38.627 --> 32:40.389
OH, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

32:40.389 --> 32:42.391
I MEAN, SHE IS A GREAT MOM.

32:42.391 --> 32:44.533
NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE.

32:44.533 --> 32:47.096
NOW WE'RE GETTIN' SOMEWHERE.

32:47.096 --> 32:50.639
I JUST NEVER THOUGHT
MY LIFE WOULD END UP LIKE THIS.

32:50.639 --> 32:52.471
IT'S LIKE
I'M TURNING INTO WHITE TRASH.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.444
(chuckles) LYNETTE,
I COME FROM WHITE TRASH.

32:55.444 --> 32:57.176
YOU ARE NOWHERE NEAR THAT.

32:57.176 --> 32:58.477
REALLY?

32:58.477 --> 33:00.009
I'M SEPARATED,

33:00.009 --> 33:02.411
MY KID IS HAVING A BABY
OUT OF WEDLOCK,

33:02.411 --> 33:04.083
I'M GETTING
INTO PUBLIC FIGHTS...

33:04.083 --> 33:07.256
I'M TWO WEEKS AWAY FROM HAVING
A WASHING MACHINE ON THE PORCH.

33:08.417 --> 33:11.460
MEANWHILE, SUSAN'S GETTING
EVERYTHING SHE WANTS.

33:11.460 --> 33:12.621
YEAH,
I DON'T THINK SUSAN'S LIFE

33:12.621 --> 33:14.363
IS GOING THE WAY SHE'D HOPED,
EITHER.

33:14.363 --> 33:15.724
ALL I KNOW IS,
SHE'S THE ONE OVER THERE

33:15.724 --> 33:18.097
PAINTING A NURSERY
FOR OUR GRANDCHILD.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.199
YEAH...

33:20.199 --> 33:22.171
WITH YOUR SON,

33:22.171 --> 33:23.632
NOT HER DAUGHTER.

33:23.632 --> 33:26.405
(Tom) THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT LYNETTE.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.577
SHE ALWAYS COMPLAINS THAT SHE
HAS TO DO EVERYTHING HERSELF.

33:28.577 --> 33:31.580
BUT GOD HELP YOU IF YOU TRY
TO DO ANYTHING FOR HER.

33:31.580 --> 33:34.183
I HAVE A BRUISED TAILBONE
TO PROVE IT.

33:34.183 --> 33:36.485
(chuckles) I MADE
THE SAME MISTAKE AS YOU.

33:36.485 --> 33:39.088
AND I WAS MARRIED TO HER.
I SHOULD KNOW.

33:39.088 --> 33:40.749
WHAT DID YOU DO?

33:40.749 --> 33:42.751
I TOOK THE KIDS OFF HER HANDS
FOR A WEEK.

33:42.751 --> 33:44.553
AND SHE WAS FINE AT FIRST.

33:44.553 --> 33:47.126
THEN SHE STARTED CALLING
EVERY TEN MINUTES

33:47.126 --> 33:48.527
TO REMIND ME
TO GIVE PAIGE HER MEDICINE

33:48.527 --> 33:51.430
OR TO MAKE SURE THAT PARKER
WORE HIS RETAINER.

33:51.430 --> 33:54.503
SHE NEEDS TO BE NEEDED.

33:54.503 --> 33:56.205
EXACTLY.

33:56.205 --> 33:57.566
AND GIVEN WHAT
I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH,

33:57.566 --> 33:59.438
I KINDA GET THAT.

33:59.438 --> 34:00.809
YEAH.

34:00.809 --> 34:04.743
SO IF YOU COULD, SUSAN,
CUT HER A BREAK.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.815
SHE'S LOST A LOT.

34:06.815 --> 34:09.547
I DON'T WANT
HER LOSING YOU, TOO.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.521
I THINK THAT'S WHY
SHE'S GOING SO OVERBOARD

34:12.521 --> 34:14.483
ON THIS NURSERY THING.

34:14.483 --> 34:17.786
SHE HOPES IT'LL GET JULIE
EXCITED ABOUT THE BABY,

34:17.786 --> 34:19.487
MAYBE BRING HER BACK.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.262
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TAKING
ALL MY ANGER AWAY,

34:23.262 --> 34:26.165
AND THAT'S NOT GONNA
LEAVE ME ANYTHING.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.437
YEAH, IT WILL.

34:28.437 --> 34:30.139
IT'LL LEAVE YOU YOUR FRIEND.

34:32.601 --> 34:34.603
(man on TV) ...MANY HOLES
IN THE METRO AREA.

34:34.603 --> 34:35.674
(switches channel)
 (gunshot)

34:35.674 --> 34:37.476
(switches channel)
 (man) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

34:37.476 --> 34:41.650
WHAT YOU WON'T DO TO GET OUT
OF BEING MARRIED TO ME.

34:41.650 --> 34:46.083
(turns off TV)
 AW, CRAP. (sighs)

34:46.083 --> 34:47.556
I KNEW I COULDN'T TRUST
THE JUMPING BEAN

34:47.556 --> 34:49.158
TO KEEP HER MOUTH SHUT.

34:49.158 --> 34:51.790
THESE ARE FOR YOU.

34:51.790 --> 34:54.123
RUSHING THINGS A BIT,
DON'T YA THINK?

34:54.123 --> 34:55.563
NOT DEAD YET. (chuckles)

34:55.563 --> 34:57.496
NO, BUT I'M ABOUT
TO KILL YA.

34:57.496 --> 35:00.469
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

35:00.469 --> 35:03.702
I DIDN'T WANT TO
PUT YOU THROUGH THIS AGAIN.

35:03.702 --> 35:08.337
KAREN, I MARRIED YOU
FOR BETTER OR WORSE.

35:08.337 --> 35:10.639
WE HAD THE BETTER,
AND NOW...

35:10.639 --> 35:13.582
WELL, WHAT IF I SAY
I DON'T WANT YOU HERE?

35:13.582 --> 35:16.515
YOU'RE AN OLD LADY.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

35:21.550 --> 35:24.893
(breathes deeply)

35:24.893 --> 35:27.196
(voice breaks) I'M SCARED.

35:27.196 --> 35:30.529
I KNOW.

35:34.603 --> 35:36.535
(cell phone rings and beeps)

35:36.535 --> 35:38.167
HEY, RENEE.

35:38.167 --> 35:40.509
Hey, uh, just wanted
to let you know

35:40.509 --> 35:42.311
THAT BEN'S TEST RESULTS
JUST GOT BACK,

35:42.311 --> 35:45.644
AND, UH, EVERYTHING IS NORMAL.
HE'S GETTING OUT TOMORROW.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.646
OH, THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
 Oh, and I got more.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.679
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER, AND I HAVE
YOU TO THANK FOR THAT.

35:50.679 --> 35:52.681
(chuckles) WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GIVE ME CREDIT.

35:52.681 --> 35:53.852
Uh, yeah, I do,

35:53.852 --> 35:55.754
BECAUSE IF
HE BREAKS MY HEART AGAIN,

35:55.754 --> 35:57.526
I'M GIVING YOU THE BLAME.

35:57.526 --> 35:59.688
(chuckles)
 (clatter)

36:00.929 --> 36:03.862
HEY, DID YOU SAY
YOU'RE AT THE HOSPITAL?

36:03.862 --> 36:05.394
Yeah.

36:05.394 --> 36:07.896
IS ANYBODY STAYING
AT YOUR PLACE?
 NO. WHY?

36:07.896 --> 36:10.269
I JUST THOUGHT I SAW A LIGHT
TURN ON.

36:10.269 --> 36:14.603
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING,
BUT I'LL GO CHECK IT OUT.

36:14.603 --> 36:16.605
(door creaks)

36:16.605 --> 36:18.777
(object shatters)

36:21.610 --> 36:23.612
(crash)

36:23.612 --> 36:25.314
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOIN'?

36:25.314 --> 36:26.555
(door closes)

36:26.555 --> 36:28.487
SOME PEOPLE USE VOICE MAIL.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.759
I PREFER TO DELIVER MY MESSAGES
IN PERSON.

36:30.759 --> 36:32.721
(ceramic shatters)

36:32.721 --> 36:34.223
SO...

36:34.223 --> 36:38.627
WHY DON'T YOU JUST MOVE ALONG
BEFORE YOU GET INVOLVED?

36:38.627 --> 36:40.869
TOO LATE.

36:40.869 --> 36:43.432
I KEEP FORGETTING YOU'RE
THE TOUGH GUY AROUND HERE.

36:43.432 --> 36:45.574
WELL... (sighs)

36:45.574 --> 36:47.936
I DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.542
(both grunt)

36:53.542 --> 36:54.683
UHH!

36:54.683 --> 36:56.285
AAH!

36:59.718 --> 37:01.850
OOH!

37:01.850 --> 37:05.354
(grunts)

37:06.425 --> 37:09.428
(grunting)

37:13.402 --> 37:16.234
I DON'T EVER WANNA SEE YOU
AGAIN.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.468
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE
KILLED ME.

37:30.579 --> 37:31.920
HEY. HEY. OOH!

37:31.920 --> 37:33.552
HANG ON.

37:33.552 --> 37:35.624
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

37:35.624 --> 37:37.556
SURPRISE! WELCOME HOME!

37:37.556 --> 37:39.628
(laughs) WHOA! WHO DID THIS?

37:39.628 --> 37:40.789
I DID.
 (door closes)

37:40.789 --> 37:41.960
REALLY?

37:41.960 --> 37:43.031
'CAUSE WHEN I GOT HOME
FROM PRISON,

37:43.031 --> 37:45.033
ALL YOU LEFT ME WAS
A POST-IT NOTE ON THE FRIDGE,

37:45.033 --> 37:48.337
AND IT SAID,
"TAKE OUT THE TRASH, EX-CON."

37:48.337 --> 37:50.999
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE YOU
FOR GRANTED ANYMORE.

37:52.901 --> 37:56.345
YOU SOUND LIKE
YOU ACTUALLY MEAN THAT.

37:56.345 --> 37:57.846
WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:57.846 --> 37:59.548
(sighs)

37:59.548 --> 38:00.949
KAREN'S CANCER IS BACK...

38:00.949 --> 38:02.511
(sighs)
 AND IT'S BAD.

38:02.511 --> 38:03.912
THAT'S WHY SHE THREW ROY OUT.

38:03.912 --> 38:06.014
OH, GOD.

38:06.014 --> 38:07.986
(bag thuds)

38:07.986 --> 38:09.988
KIND OF MAKES YOU THINK.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.360
I MEAN, WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,

38:11.360 --> 38:12.921
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
THE FINISH LINE.

38:12.921 --> 38:17.726
BUT IT'S NOT. DEATH IS.
NO ONE TOLD US THAT.

38:17.726 --> 38:19.297
YEAH, THEY DID.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.030
AT OUR WEDDING, THEY SAID,
"TILL DEATH DO US PART."

38:22.030 --> 38:23.572
OH, CARLOS, PLEASE.

38:23.572 --> 38:26.034
I HAD FOUR GLASSES OF CHAMPAGNE
BEFORE THE CEREMONY.

38:26.034 --> 38:27.376
I ALMOST MARRIED YOUR UNCLE.

38:27.376 --> 38:28.537
OH, COME ON, GABY.

38:28.537 --> 38:29.938
I MEAN, THE IDEA
THAT WE MIGHT DIE SOMEDAY

38:29.938 --> 38:31.780
MUST HAVE AT LEAST
CROSSED YOUR MIND.

38:31.780 --> 38:34.883
I JUST NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT IT REALLY MEANS,

38:34.883 --> 38:36.044
THAT ONE OF US IS GONNA DIE,

38:36.044 --> 38:37.816
AND THE OTHER ONE'S GONNA
LIVE THROUGH IT.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.419
AND IF IT'S YOU WHO'S FIRST?

38:40.419 --> 38:42.391
I DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT.

38:44.453 --> 38:46.995
YES, YOU CAN.

38:46.995 --> 38:48.997
YOU'RE ONE OF
THE BRAVEST PEOPLE I KNOW.

38:48.997 --> 38:52.501
LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
THIS YEAR.

38:52.501 --> 38:54.102
YOU'VE BEEN MY ROCK.

38:54.102 --> 38:56.635
I HAVE?

38:56.635 --> 38:58.967
WELL...

38:58.967 --> 39:00.909
YOU AND SCOTCH.

39:00.909 --> 39:02.741
BUT FROM NOW ON, JUST YOU.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.873
THANK YOU.

39:04.873 --> 39:07.446
(chuckles)

39:07.446 --> 39:09.848
AND, HEY, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

39:09.848 --> 39:12.621
YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE
THE EASY WAY OUT--DIE FIRST.

39:19.087 --> 39:20.789
(sighs)

39:22.491 --> 39:24.132
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE NAME?

39:24.132 --> 39:26.034
YOU DIDN'T CHANGE IT TO "SOP,"
DID YOU?

39:26.034 --> 39:28.437
'CAUSE THAT'S EVEN WORSE
THAN "LYNETTE."

39:30.969 --> 39:33.942
"LYNETTE" ISN'T SO BAD.

39:33.942 --> 39:36.405
(clatter)

39:36.405 --> 39:38.076
THANKS FOR THAT.

39:38.076 --> 39:39.848
YEAH, WELL...

39:39.848 --> 39:43.111
THANK YOU
FOR ALL THE REST OF THIS.

39:43.111 --> 39:44.553
SO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

39:44.553 --> 39:48.457
UM...

39:48.457 --> 39:51.119
THE NAIL HOLES
NEED TO BE SPACKLED.

39:51.119 --> 39:54.523
MM. I'M ON IT.

40:06.705 --> 40:10.038
(telephone rings)

40:11.179 --> 40:13.011
(ring)

40:13.011 --> 40:15.544
(sighs)
 (beep)

40:15.544 --> 40:16.715
HELLO?

40:16.715 --> 40:18.046
Bree, it's Orson.

40:18.046 --> 40:19.017
(beep)

40:19.017 --> 40:21.089
(clatter)

40:21.089 --> 40:24.152
(ring)

40:24.152 --> 40:26.755
(beep)

40:26.755 --> 40:28.557
(whispering) LISTEN TO ME.

40:28.557 --> 40:31.800
DON'T YOU EVER CALL MY HOUSE
AGAIN.

40:31.800 --> 40:34.563
I CAN ASSURE YOU THIS IS
THE LAST YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME.

40:34.563 --> 40:36.164
WHAT DO YOU WANT, ORSON?

40:36.164 --> 40:39.137
I've been thinking about what
you said, and you're right.

40:39.137 --> 40:42.070
THE SINS THAT HAVE BEEN
COMMITTED ARE SO REPREHENSIBLE

40:42.070 --> 40:45.143
THAT A SACRIFICE MUST BE MADE.

40:45.143 --> 40:47.045
THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.

40:49.047 --> 40:52.050
DO NOT CONSIDER SUICIDE.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.583
THAT WOULD ONLY BE ADDING
MORE SINS TO YOUR LIST.

40:54.583 --> 40:57.586
YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUDGE,
BREE.

40:57.586 --> 41:00.589
SOMEONE ELSE WILL DO THAT
FOR YOU.

41:00.589 --> 41:03.762
GOOD-BYE... FOREVER.

41:05.764 --> 41:08.897
(dial tone)

41:08.897 --> 41:10.238
YES.
 (beep)

41:10.238 --> 41:15.644
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE ALL
COULD USE A LITTLE HELP.

41:17.175 --> 41:21.710
WHEN OUR GENEROSITY
HAS BEEN REPAID WITH CRUELTY...

41:24.082 --> 41:29.788
WHEN OUR BEHAVIOR HAS FILLED US
WITH REGRET...

41:34.162 --> 41:39.167
AND WHEN OUR FUTURE HAS BECOME
TERRIBLY UNCERTAIN.

41:39.167 --> 41:41.700
♪♪♪

41:41.700 --> 41:43.672
(creaks)

41:46.805 --> 41:52.140
BUT THEN THERE ARE THOSE
WHO ARE PAST THE POINT OF HELP,

41:52.140 --> 41:54.182
AND IN THEIR WAKE,

41:54.182 --> 41:57.846
THEY LEAVE NOTHING
BUT DESTRUCTION.
