00:37.891 --> 00:41.555
(man) Mother, Father, what's afoot?

00:41.639 --> 00:44.515
Only Possum, black as soot.

00:44.599 --> 00:47.307
Mother, Father, where to tread?

00:47.391 --> 00:50.515
Far from Possum and his head.

00:51.807 --> 00:55.555
Here's a bag, now what's inside?

00:55.639 --> 00:58.223
Does he seek or does he hide?

00:59.267 --> 01:01.891
Can you spy him, deep within?

01:03.223 --> 01:06.307
Little Possum, black as sin.

03:30.183 --> 03:33.431
- (boy 1) Did you hear about it?
- (boy 2) I know where that happened.

03:33.515 --> 03:34.515
(boy 1) Where?

03:34.599 --> 03:36.683
- (boy 3) He doesn't know.
- (boy 2) All right.

03:36.767 --> 03:38.975
- (boy 1) Where, then?
- (boy 2) Fallmarsh Woods.

03:39.055 --> 03:40.975
(boy 3) Liar.
They ain't even said who it was.

03:41.055 --> 03:44.307
- Besides, it was the old army barracks.
- (boy 1) Whereabouts?

03:44.391 --> 03:46.599
(boy 2) Fallmarsh Woods,
the police said.

03:46.683 --> 03:47.683
(boy 3) Liar.

03:47.767 --> 03:50.515
(boy 2) Well, my uncle told me,
and his neighbour's a policeman.

03:50.599 --> 03:51.599
(boy 1) Bollocks is he.

03:51.683 --> 03:53.847
- (boy 2) He knows all about you.
- (boys laugh)

03:53.931 --> 03:57.015
(boy 1) Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop! Why you hittin' me? Stop.

03:57.099 --> 04:01.307
- Stop, both of you. Stop.
- (driver) Fallmarsh, next stop.

04:14.975 --> 04:16.430
What were you drawing?

05:27.267 --> 05:28.847
(lock turns)

07:31.555 --> 07:32.767
(shuts door)

07:56.599 --> 07:57.807
Maurice?

09:24.015 --> 09:25.475
(clattering)

10:19.015 --> 10:21.807
(man) Bag is open, growing wider.

10:21.891 --> 10:25.639
What's inside, man or spider?

10:25.723 --> 10:28.475
Little boy, don't lose your way.

10:28.555 --> 10:30.723
Possum wants to come and play.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.555
(water runs)

11:03.267 --> 11:04.475
(turns off tap)

11:53.347 --> 11:55.099
(man) Going in?

12:10.639 --> 12:11.639
No.

12:26.475 --> 12:28.767
Mind of its own?

12:41.055 --> 12:43.099
The legs are impressive.

12:45.267 --> 12:48.099
- What exactly is it?
- It's a puppet.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.555
You show that to children?

12:53.639 --> 12:56.267
- (pours tea)
- I'm destroying it.

13:00.099 --> 13:01.139
Even the head?

13:10.975 --> 13:13.807
I heard about your performance.

13:16.223 --> 13:19.515
An old teaching colleague of mine
wrote to me.

13:20.139 --> 13:22.723
A scandal, by all accounts.

13:22.807 --> 13:25.099
They'll take me back, once that's gone.

13:25.807 --> 13:27.099
(spits)

13:28.723 --> 13:31.683
Now you won't get something
from the jar.

13:34.307 --> 13:36.475
May I have a demonstration?

13:38.015 --> 13:40.683
I wanna see how the legs work.

13:43.931 --> 13:45.015
Before you kill it.

13:46.223 --> 13:47.975
Can't kill it, it's a puppet.

13:52.515 --> 13:54.683
Burn it, will you?

14:03.475 --> 14:05.683
This place is disgusting, Maurice.

14:14.055 --> 14:16.307
King of the castle.

14:20.267 --> 14:23.683
Remember, a demonstration.

16:29.267 --> 16:32.515
(man) Look at Possum, there he lies.

16:32.723 --> 16:35.683
Children, meet his lifeless eyes.

16:37.055 --> 16:39.475
See his nasty legs and tongue.

16:40.223 --> 16:43.099
When he wakens, watch him run.

16:44.099 --> 16:45.307
(man in distance) Philip!

17:31.639 --> 17:32.891
(Maurice) Come in.

17:36.347 --> 17:38.099
I want to borrow the tools.

17:42.767 --> 17:44.307
Please?

18:10.767 --> 18:12.807
- Hungry?
- No.

18:13.515 --> 18:15.099
Roast fox.

18:16.307 --> 18:17.767
Funny.

18:21.599 --> 18:23.431
Dismantling it, are you?

18:24.975 --> 18:27.475
- In my own time, yeah.
- Pity.

18:28.099 --> 18:30.891
Puppetry's the one thing
you were good at.

18:32.183 --> 18:33.683
Staying, are you?

18:34.723 --> 18:37.891
For a while. My house.

18:48.807 --> 18:50.099
Remember this one?

18:52.391 --> 18:53.847
Well made.

18:54.475 --> 18:56.515
My father taught me, you know.

18:57.099 --> 19:00.391
- Runs in the family.
- You're not my father, Maurice.

19:07.891 --> 19:09.891
Bring 'em back.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.931
(white noise)

19:34.599 --> 19:37.847
(woman on TV) Police are investigating
the disappearance of a 14-year-old boy

19:37.931 --> 19:39.723
near Fullmarsh, in Norfolk.

19:39.807 --> 19:42.475
Officers are searching
local woodlands and waste ground

19:42.555 --> 19:44.267
in an effort to find the teenager,

19:44.347 --> 19:47.683
who was last seen on his way home
from Marshwood Secondary School

19:47.767 --> 19:50.683
- in the area of Full...
- (white noise)

20:05.099 --> 20:06.307
(turns off TV)

20:18.515 --> 20:20.307
Is that you, pervert?

20:32.683 --> 20:33.683
Come on.

20:56.639 --> 20:58.307
(teacher) Can I ask what you're doing?

20:59.847 --> 21:01.183
Nothing.

21:02.139 --> 21:03.639
Why are you waiting there?

21:05.931 --> 21:07.683
Used to be my school.

21:10.055 --> 21:11.223
Move on, will you?

21:14.723 --> 21:17.639
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

21:37.515 --> 21:38.515
(Philip exhales)

22:48.723 --> 22:50.891
- (man in distance) Philip!
- (Philip gasps)

24:01.891 --> 24:03.891
(breathes heavily)

26:29.931 --> 26:35.723
(Philip) Wait awhile, my little child,
for what is playing dead.

26:35.807 --> 26:41.099
Possum, with his black balloons,
will eat you up in bed.

28:48.183 --> 28:49.891
Waking up, is it?

28:50.931 --> 28:52.223
Wants to get out.

29:16.847 --> 29:18.891
Something from the jar?

29:34.599 --> 29:36.055
What's in them?

29:36.555 --> 29:38.723
Same as always.

29:39.807 --> 29:41.099
No, then.

29:43.139 --> 29:44.767
All grown up now.

30:15.599 --> 30:17.891
Tell me again about the fox.

30:22.055 --> 30:23.223
Why?

30:24.599 --> 30:25.847
Why not?

30:29.055 --> 30:30.055
No.

30:31.099 --> 30:32.515
Tell me.

30:38.267 --> 30:40.267
We were on the marshes,

30:40.347 --> 30:41.891
me and the other boys.

30:42.767 --> 30:44.931
I'd built a den there.

30:45.015 --> 30:47.099
Out by the bridges there.

30:49.391 --> 30:51.055
I wanted to show 'em.

30:53.183 --> 30:56.267
When we got there, we found a fox.

30:56.975 --> 31:00.099
Thought it had swallowed something,
'cause it was pantin'.

31:00.891 --> 31:03.515
Whole body was shakin'
like it was dyin'.

31:07.015 --> 31:08.683
They started to kick it.

31:09.847 --> 31:11.683
All of 'em. Yeah.

31:14.639 --> 31:17.099
Kicked it around like it was a ball...

31:23.475 --> 31:25.599
Then stuck things in it,
till it was dead.

31:27.891 --> 31:29.099
Then what?

31:30.847 --> 31:32.683
Wanted me to pick it up.

31:34.347 --> 31:35.683
Made me.

31:37.599 --> 31:39.639
They grabbed my head,

31:39.723 --> 31:42.683
pushed my face inside
where it was rotten.

31:49.807 --> 31:51.683
I started to cry.

31:53.599 --> 31:54.891
They laughed.

31:55.807 --> 31:57.475
Ran off and left me.

32:02.099 --> 32:03.683
And then after a while...

32:07.015 --> 32:08.307
the fox...

32:09.555 --> 32:12.099
opened its eyes and stared at me.

32:15.055 --> 32:17.099
Stood up and walked away.

32:27.767 --> 32:28.767
There.

32:30.683 --> 32:32.267
(chuckles)

32:32.347 --> 32:34.891
(laughs)

32:36.431 --> 32:38.347
(coughs)

32:39.767 --> 32:41.307
Sly bugger.

32:42.223 --> 32:43.683
Playin' with ya.

32:51.099 --> 32:53.475
Yours, I believe.

32:57.807 --> 32:59.431
Like this house, Maurice.

33:11.807 --> 33:14.267
They're demolishing the old barracks.

33:16.391 --> 33:18.099
About bloody time.

33:19.391 --> 33:21.475
Black as sin, it is.

33:48.099 --> 33:49.807
Going in?

34:02.891 --> 34:04.475
(door opens)

39:27.807 --> 39:30.347
(breathes heavily)

39:30.431 --> 39:32.391
(gasps)

41:19.391 --> 41:20.391
Maurice?

42:12.015 --> 42:18.183
(Maurice in the distance) "Possum.
How he came into the world. 1978."

42:19.055 --> 42:21.099
"By Philip Connell."

42:25.767 --> 42:28.807
(Maurice in the distance)
"After the fire. Possum."

42:30.307 --> 42:34.183
"Was it he who blackened
the very sun above our town?"

42:36.055 --> 42:41.183
"Possum. Does his stare not seem
like the face of waking death?"

42:43.055 --> 42:46.599
"Behold how he came into the world."

42:49.475 --> 42:56.099
"Mother, Father, what's afoot?
Only Possum, black as soot."

42:57.807 --> 43:00.807
(Maurice's voice grows louder)
"Mother, Father, where to tread?"

43:02.223 --> 43:04.975
"Far from Possum and his head."

43:07.975 --> 43:14.183
"Wait awhile, my little child,
for what is playing dead."

43:14.267 --> 43:17.183
(Maurice's voice grows louder)
"Possum, with his black balloons,

43:17.267 --> 43:19.975
will eat you up in bed."

43:21.807 --> 43:24.599
"Look at Possum, there he lies."

43:26.347 --> 43:29.807
"Children, meet his lifeless eyes."

43:31.807 --> 43:38.599
"See his nasty legs and tongue.
When he wakens, watch him run."

43:40.391 --> 43:43.599
"Here's a bag, now what's inside?"

43:44.975 --> 43:47.975
"Does he seek, or does he hide?"

43:49.015 --> 43:52.183
"Can you spy him, deep within?"

43:52.267 --> 43:55.599
"Little Possum, black as sin."

43:58.975 --> 44:01.099
"Bag is open, growing wider."

44:02.391 --> 44:03.683
"What's inside it,

44:04.431 --> 44:06.807
man or spider?"

44:08.055 --> 44:10.931
"Little boy, don't lose your way."

44:11.015 --> 44:14.183
"Possum wants to come and play."

44:22.391 --> 44:26.639
- Where'd you get that?
- Fell. From there.

44:26.723 --> 44:28.475
Liar.

44:46.223 --> 44:48.391
(chuckles)

44:50.139 --> 44:51.391
(laughs)

44:57.599 --> 45:00.599
(laughs loudly)

45:09.475 --> 45:12.015
Didn't know you could draw as well.

45:13.055 --> 45:14.391
Private.

45:15.475 --> 45:17.639
Is it dead yet?

45:19.723 --> 45:21.847
Mind your own business.

45:21.931 --> 45:23.975
(Maurice) Perhaps it's still playin'.

45:28.475 --> 45:32.599
- You won't see me again, Maurice.
- Won't I?

45:32.723 --> 45:34.807
Train line's down.

45:34.891 --> 45:37.183
Home for the holidays, you are.

45:38.139 --> 45:41.055
But I'd watch
where you're treadin', lad.

45:41.139 --> 45:44.723
- People are talkin'.
- Talkin' about what?

45:44.807 --> 45:47.347
Don't you read the papers?

45:57.975 --> 46:00.267
Why didn't you burn, Maurice, eh?

46:01.807 --> 46:02.975
Hmm?

46:04.807 --> 46:07.055
Why wasn't it you?

46:07.139 --> 46:08.975
(chuckles)

46:09.975 --> 46:11.515
(laughs)

46:13.223 --> 46:15.515
(continues laughing)

46:22.223 --> 46:24.599
(coughs)

51:13.931 --> 51:15.307
Maurice?

51:32.267 --> 51:33.683
Maurice?

51:38.975 --> 51:41.307
(runs upstairs)

52:07.931 --> 52:14.099
(Philip) Happy valley, painted black,
all the children in a sack.

52:14.183 --> 52:17.639
Wave goodbye to sun and moon.

52:17.723 --> 52:20.099
Say hello to black balloon.

55:00.307 --> 55:03.015
Happened before, I recall.

55:03.099 --> 55:06.891
Your time. After the fire.

55:12.139 --> 55:13.847
Your school, wasn't it?

55:20.183 --> 55:23.015
I taught you there once, remember?

55:24.267 --> 55:28.099
- I remember.
- That business with the fox...

55:29.307 --> 55:32.891
A colleague asked me in
to teach them all a lesson.

55:33.931 --> 55:36.099
Remember their faces.

55:37.223 --> 55:38.847
We showed 'em, didn't we?

55:40.267 --> 55:42.307
Petrified, they were.

56:56.847 --> 56:58.931
Stuffed 'em inside a bag, didn't he?

57:00.139 --> 57:03.307
Wore a mask so they couldn't see him.

57:05.223 --> 57:06.683
There, there, lad.

57:06.767 --> 57:08.475
I had no idea.

57:13.723 --> 57:16.807
I'm sorry. Here.

57:28.723 --> 57:30.431
(Philip whimpers)

57:31.099 --> 57:34.099
- (Maurice) I had no idea.
- (gags)

57:35.639 --> 57:37.099
(gags)

01:00:05.767 --> 01:00:07.891
(breathes heavily)

01:00:41.639 --> 01:00:43.099
(knocking at door)

01:00:56.683 --> 01:00:59.099
(knocking continues)

01:01:43.891 --> 01:01:46.099
(car engine starts)

01:01:48.891 --> 01:01:51.099
(car drives away)

01:03:05.683 --> 01:03:07.347
Maurice?

01:03:07.431 --> 01:03:09.515
(white noise on TV)

01:03:22.307 --> 01:03:24.891
(woman's voice on TV)

01:03:35.599 --> 01:03:37.099
(white noise)

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:40.391
(woman on TV)
Police are widening their search

01:03:40.475 --> 01:03:42.139
for missing teenager Michael Browning

01:03:42.223 --> 01:03:45.599
who disappeared on his way home
from school on Tuesday afternoon.

01:03:45.683 --> 01:03:49.015
Officers are investigating reports
of a man acting suspiciously

01:03:49.099 --> 01:03:52.475
near woodlands and waste ground,
close to a former military barracks

01:03:52.555 --> 01:03:54.639
in the area of Fullmarsh.

01:03:55.139 --> 01:03:57.807
The suspect,
who was wearing a beige raincoat,

01:03:57.891 --> 01:04:02.099
was seen several times with a boy
matching Michael's description.

01:04:02.183 --> 01:04:05.515
Police are warning members of the public
not to approach the man,

01:04:05.599 --> 01:04:09.639
and urge anyone with information
to contact the police on this number...

01:05:46.807 --> 01:05:48.807
(Maurice) What are you lookin' for?

01:05:57.515 --> 01:05:59.683
I wanna talk to you.

01:06:12.807 --> 01:06:14.975
- (Philip knocks)
- (Maurice) Come.

01:06:22.015 --> 01:06:24.183
Someone come 'ere for you.

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:27.015
Who?

01:06:27.639 --> 01:06:29.347
Law, I reckon.

01:06:29.847 --> 01:06:33.347
- What did they want?
- None of my business.

01:06:33.431 --> 01:06:35.015
Said you were out.

01:06:37.055 --> 01:06:38.847
Did you find him?

01:06:39.807 --> 01:06:42.975
- Who?
- Who you're lookin' for.

01:06:45.723 --> 01:06:50.347
- No.
- He'll turn up. They always do.

01:06:51.723 --> 01:06:53.015
We burnt it.

01:06:53.975 --> 01:06:56.599
You and me, we burnt it, the puppet.

01:06:56.683 --> 01:06:58.391
You look confused, lad.

01:06:59.391 --> 01:07:00.767
You don't look well.

01:07:01.723 --> 01:07:02.975
Your face.

01:07:04.683 --> 01:07:07.683
Maybe you best lie low for a while.

01:07:12.391 --> 01:07:13.891
I'm goin' away.

01:07:16.183 --> 01:07:17.931
Where you goin'?

01:07:18.015 --> 01:07:19.807
My business.

01:07:21.847 --> 01:07:24.183
You'll have this place to yourself.

01:07:25.307 --> 01:07:26.767
Don't bring trouble home.

01:07:30.391 --> 01:07:32.307
Bloody kids.

01:08:37.099 --> 01:08:38.599
(woman) Wait there, please.

01:08:41.639 --> 01:08:45.183
Can I see him then, please, miss?
Will I... Will I see him, Mr Grant?

01:08:45.267 --> 01:08:47.139
He's my form teacher.

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:49.346
He knows all about it.
He knows what's happened.

01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:51.099
Said he'd come with me.

01:08:51.975 --> 01:08:55.346
- Come where?
- Police station, miss.

01:08:56.346 --> 01:08:57.807
Wait there, please.

01:09:31.055 --> 01:09:32.055
(indistinct talking)

01:09:32.139 --> 01:09:36.099
(man) OK, will you call them?
And I'll keep him here.

01:15:42.723 --> 01:15:46.391
(Maurice) The parcel opened,
out it sprang,

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:49.807
the black long-legged Possum man.

01:15:49.891 --> 01:15:55.183
Children, run! He'll eat and smother
any child without a mother.

01:15:57.015 --> 01:15:58.599
(Philip) Maurice!

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:01.767
Maurice!

01:16:01.847 --> 01:16:03.223

01:16:03.307 --> 01:16:04.599
(clattering)

01:16:05.639 --> 01:16:07.515
Maurice!

01:16:08.015 --> 01:16:09.599

01:19:27.307 --> 01:19:28.807
(Philip yells)

01:19:31.891 --> 01:19:33.223
(Philip moans)

01:19:33.683 --> 01:19:35.391
(breathes heavily)

01:19:44.555 --> 01:19:48.055
- Come to see Mummy and Daddy?
- No, no, no.

01:19:48.139 --> 01:19:50.555

01:19:50.639 --> 01:19:53.267

- No. (groans) No, no, no.

01:19:59.639 --> 01:20:01.475
Poor orphan boy.

01:20:01.555 --> 01:20:06.139
- Mummy and Daddy all burned away?
- No.

01:20:06.223 --> 01:20:11.515
There, there. Uncle's here, lad.
Uncle Maurice with his fingers.

01:20:11.599 --> 01:20:13.391

01:20:16.347 --> 01:20:17.475

01:20:21.475 --> 01:20:23.723
- (Maurice) Do you like my fingers, boy?
- No.

01:20:24.555 --> 01:20:25.975
Have you missed them?

01:20:26.391 --> 01:20:31.223
Please... Please, Uncle Maurice, don't.
Please, don't.

01:20:31.307 --> 01:20:34.223
Do you want my fingers,
you dirty, filthy boy?

01:20:34.307 --> 01:20:35.639
No!

01:20:35.723 --> 01:20:36.975

01:20:38.975 --> 01:20:40.139

01:20:40.223 --> 01:20:41.975
Open up, I said!

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:47.807

01:20:47.891 --> 01:20:50.139

01:20:51.891 --> 01:20:54.931
Leave your poor, wicked uncle all alone?

01:20:55.515 --> 01:21:00.307
- (groans) No, please.
- Poor Philip.

01:21:00.931 --> 01:21:02.767
Poor, broken Philip.

01:21:03.347 --> 01:21:05.099
All grown up.

01:21:05.847 --> 01:21:07.639

You knew it was me, didn't you, boy?
Out by the barracks.

Worked everywhere, I have.

But you said nothing. Silly boy.

01:21:38.599 --> 01:21:40.515
