00:21.021 --> 00:24.650
[Orson welles] for my next experiment,
ladies and gentlemen...

00:24.758 --> 00:28.922
I would appreciate the loan of any
small personal object from your pocket-

00:29.029 --> 00:31.725
a key or a box of matches, a coin.

00:31.831 --> 00:37.030
Ah, a key it is. Good sir.
Hold it up 10 feet over your head.

00:37.137 --> 00:41.938
And watch out for the slightest hint
of hanky-panky.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.910
And behold, before our very eyes...

00:46.012 --> 00:47.912
a transformation.

00:48.014 --> 00:50.141
We've changed your key...

00:52.652 --> 00:54.279
into a coin.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.855
What happened to the key?
It's been returned to you.

00:56.956 --> 01:00.892
Look closely, sir.
You'll find the key...

01:00.994 --> 01:02.894
back in your pocket.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.896
May we see it, please?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.595
Up to your old tricks, I see.

01:08.701 --> 01:11.295
Why not? I'm a charlatan.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.497
What's that, sir?
Did I used to be a magician?

01:13.606 --> 01:16.006
Sir, I'm still working on it.

01:16.109 --> 01:21.240
As for the key,
it was not symbolic of anything.

01:21.347 --> 01:23.247
This isn't that kind of movie.

01:23.349 --> 01:25.340
You'll find the coin now
in your pocket, sir.

01:25.452 --> 01:28.080
Keep your eyes on that coin, sir...

01:28.188 --> 01:31.589
while it's returned to you as your key.

01:31.691 --> 01:35.320
Shall we return you to your mother?
Is this your mother? No, of course not.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.521
Open your mouth, wide...

01:37.630 --> 01:40.690
and we'll return you your money.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.792
And by the way, have you ever
heard of Robert-Houdin?

01:44.838 --> 01:48.274
Speaking of magicians, I mean?
No, of course not.

01:48.374 --> 01:51.036
- But of course you do know my partner,
François Reichenbach?
- Hello.

01:51.144 --> 01:54.875
Houdin was the greatest magician
who ever lived.

01:54.981 --> 01:56.915
And do you know what he said?

02:02.122 --> 02:06.718
- "A magician," he said, "is just an actor."
- Well, good luck to you.

02:06.826 --> 02:10.626
Just an actor
playing the part of a magician.

02:18.004 --> 02:21.496
- [François] very nice.
- And she's fabulously rich too.

02:21.608 --> 02:24.008
- There's a good story about it.
- Do you want to tell it?

02:24.110 --> 02:26.374
We'll come to that one later.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.379
No, it's time for an introduction.

02:35.855 --> 02:38.380
Ladies and gentlemen,
by way of introduction...

02:38.491 --> 02:43.121
this is a film about trickery and fraud...

02:43.229 --> 02:46.164
about lies.

02:46.266 --> 02:50.134
Tell it by the fireside or
in a marketplace or in a movie...

02:50.236 --> 02:52.898
almost any story is almost certainly...

02:53.006 --> 02:54.906
some kind of lie.

02:56.342 --> 02:59.470
But not this time.
No, this is a promise.

02:59.579 --> 03:03.242
During the next hour, everything
you'll hear from us is really true...

03:03.349 --> 03:05.249
and based on solid facts.

03:06.719 --> 03:09.882
You don't talk about
napoleon or Julius Caesar.

03:09.989 --> 03:12.890
- You're talking about Elmyr.
- [Welles] Elmyr?

03:12.992 --> 03:14.857
- Elmyr?
- [Welles] who is Elmyr?

03:14.961 --> 03:18.590
That question has yet to be answered
with any real precision.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.792
- Can I kiss you too?
- Certainly.

03:21.901 --> 03:24.369
Anybody want to eat?

03:24.470 --> 03:27.962
[Welles] in the world of the jet-setters,
among us beautiful people...

03:28.074 --> 03:31.407
everybody knows Elmyr,
but Elmyr what?

03:31.511 --> 03:33.911
- He has about 60 time the same name.
- [Welles] de hory?

03:34.013 --> 03:38.882
He's called his name hory, heury,
bory, sury, kury, bury, dury-all the -

03:38.985 --> 03:40.748
[speaking french]

03:40.853 --> 03:42.718
With put u-r-y. Sixty names.

03:42.822 --> 03:46.952
- His real name was Elmyr Ferenc Huffman.
- Then 60 personalities...

03:47.093 --> 03:49.118
as much lies and as much real.

03:49.195 --> 03:52.892
Well, it sounds very jesuitical.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.628
Yes, his world
is a world of make-believe.

03:59.672 --> 04:03.130
- I'm not an actor.
- Not an actor? Elmyr?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.177
I'm not an actor.

04:06.546 --> 04:09.947
- I am not a professional actor.
- [Welles] he's a leading actor in this movie.

04:10.049 --> 04:13.246
His profession, it's true,
is painting-painting fakes.

04:13.353 --> 04:16.322
Among all fakers,
Elmyr is number two.

04:16.422 --> 04:19.050
[François]
Once I saw a man from Ibiza...

04:19.158 --> 04:22.184
writing a book on fake,
who came to see me to Paris.

04:22.295 --> 04:25.492
He said, "I heard you are
the first man who bought an Elmyr."

04:25.598 --> 04:29.967
- [Welles] and that man's name was-
- Clifford Irving.

04:33.306 --> 04:37.174
[Man] the important distinction
to make when you're talking about...

04:37.277 --> 04:41.338
the genuine quality of a painting...

04:42.382 --> 04:45.613
is not so much whether
it's a real painting or a fake.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.014
It's whether it's a good fake
or a bad fake.

05:28.027 --> 05:31.428
[High heels tapping]

05:40.606 --> 05:42.665
[Brakes squealing]

05:54.654 --> 05:58.181
[High heels tapping]

06:00.460 --> 06:02.894
[Horns honking]

06:07.066 --> 06:10.297
[Horns honking]

06:16.008 --> 06:18.738
[No audible dialogue]

06:26.219 --> 06:28.244
[Tires squealing]

06:43.770 --> 06:45.829
[Motorcycle revving]

06:48.174 --> 06:51.166
[High heels tapping]

06:58.284 --> 07:00.252
[No audible dialogue]

07:02.722 --> 07:05.350
[No audible dialogue]

07:41.160 --> 07:44.027
[Welles]
Her name...

07:44.130 --> 07:47.725
is Oja, Oja Kodar.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.234
And this, by the way,
is from quite another film...

07:50.336 --> 07:55.899
a sequence on the fine
outdoor sport of girl-watching.

07:56.008 --> 08:01.878
Our sneaky crew of cameramen hidden away
in camouflaged trucks and packing boxes...

08:01.981 --> 08:04.040
arranged for her to act for them.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.710
To act as bait.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.719
[Heels tapping]

08:11.023 --> 08:12.923
You see how it worked.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.086
The entire cast...

08:17.196 --> 08:20.097
all the performers, except one...

08:20.199 --> 08:23.225
acting away like crazy for us
without getting paid for it...

08:23.336 --> 08:25.702
- without even knowing they were movie actors.
- Mama mia.!

08:25.805 --> 08:28.740
- Simple larceny. Well, maybe not simple.
- Mama mia.!

08:28.841 --> 08:30.775
That year nothing was simple...

08:31.811 --> 08:33.711
least of all the larceny.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.905
Now in this little gag,
Lawrence Harvey...

08:36.015 --> 08:38.677
our leading man
from yet another movie...

08:38.784 --> 08:42.652
couldn't arrange space
for miss Kodar on a plane.

08:42.755 --> 08:45.952
Well, there's no room in this movie
to tell you why in that other one...

08:46.058 --> 08:49.516
we squeezed miss Kodar into
a more convenient size for traveling...

08:49.629 --> 08:51.756
by a magical illusion.

08:54.800 --> 08:58.566
But you really must believe that
what comes afterwards is solid fact.

08:58.671 --> 09:02.038
Yes, after this bit of hocus-pocus,
the next thing we heard about her...

09:02.141 --> 09:04.041
was not as an actress...

09:04.143 --> 09:08.136
but as the leading figure
in a notorious swindle.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.813
I took another plane,
grew another beard...

09:15.922 --> 09:18.652
made another movie
and well before miss Kodar-

09:20.560 --> 09:24.257
we'll leave miss Kodar
aside for the moment.

09:24.363 --> 09:26.763
But in case that mumbojumbo
might make it seem...

09:26.866 --> 09:30.199
that there's going to be some trickery
in this film about trickery...

09:30.303 --> 09:32.737
we'll repeat our promise...

09:32.838 --> 09:34.829
in writing.

09:34.941 --> 09:39.071
The girl-watching was evidence
of how much of all this was filmed...

09:39.178 --> 09:42.875
in blissful ignorance of the facts...

09:42.982 --> 09:44.950
about some of the various characters...

09:45.051 --> 09:47.485
who found their way
in front of our cameras.

09:47.587 --> 09:51.284
Well, Clifford Irving told
the story in the book.

09:51.390 --> 09:53.187
[Welles]
Maybe.

09:53.292 --> 09:57.126
Well, by now, you understand,
I'd fallen in with François.

09:57.229 --> 09:59.220
And on the island of Ibiza...

09:59.332 --> 10:02.301
we'd fallen smack into
the biggest series of scandals...

10:02.401 --> 10:04.198
in the whole history of hoaxing.

10:04.303 --> 10:07.363
It was a pretty queer experience
to start making yet another movie...

10:07.473 --> 10:10.271
and end up making yet another...

10:10.376 --> 10:14.176
with a story line
rotten with coincidence.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.681
For instance, that the author of
fake! A book about a faker...

10:17.783 --> 10:23.153
was himself a faker and the author
of a fake to end all fakes-

10:23.255 --> 10:25.951
and that he must have been cooking it up
when we were filming him.

10:26.058 --> 10:29.152
- [Sighs] well.
- [Man] quiet, please. Edith Irving.

10:29.261 --> 10:35.166
- Take three.
- Look, you've known Elmyr longer
than anyone else on this island.

10:35.267 --> 10:37.895
Do you really believe
he did all those fakes?

10:38.004 --> 10:40.370
- No, I really don't believe it.
- [Welles] sorry.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.464
I've been jumping around like this
because that's the way it was.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.475
- [Man] Clifford Irving, take two.
- [Welles chuckles]

10:44.577 --> 10:47.307
Let's pull ourselves together if we can
and begin at the beginning.

10:47.413 --> 10:51.247
Now, on this tablecloth, which is decorated
with a map, is where everything-

10:51.350 --> 10:54.251
- [crew laughing]
- Which I've just loused up with some wine.

10:54.353 --> 10:58.312
But I understand wine
brings good luck behind the ear.

10:58.424 --> 11:00.722
Well, we can use a little luck anywhere.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.852
And here is -
I'll have to mark it in.

11:03.963 --> 11:08.730
On this tiny island is where the two
great hoaxes were hatched - Ibiza.

11:11.937 --> 11:16.271
One island, two Ibizas.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.400
The serious, indeed,
the very sober part...

11:18.511 --> 11:20.911
is part of Spain.

11:21.013 --> 11:25.916
And the other, "an island in the sun,"
life magazine calls it...

11:26.018 --> 11:28.953
"where restless souls
may find each other."

11:30.156 --> 11:32.886
The restless souls being, I guess...

11:32.992 --> 11:35.552
cliff Irving, over there-

11:35.661 --> 11:38.425
and Elmyr.

11:38.531 --> 11:42.695
Coincidence number one:
That these two world leaders in fakery...

11:42.802 --> 11:46.101
operated, quite separately,
on the same tiny island.

11:47.873 --> 11:52.105
That's Mrs. Irving.
Elmyr and Mrs. Irving.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.236
[Man on TV] Clifford Irving,
who declared that he himself...

11:54.346 --> 11:56.871
had delivered to
Howard Hughes or his aides...

11:56.982 --> 12:00.281
the quarter of a million dollars
publisher's advance...

12:00.386 --> 12:03.378
suddenly confessed today
that Mrs. Irving...

12:03.489 --> 12:07.152
is the same Helga r. Hughes
wanted by the police -

12:07.259 --> 12:12.162
[man on TV speaking Spanish]

12:12.264 --> 12:15.028
[Continues in Spanish]

12:15.134 --> 12:18.262
"If Clifford dragged Edith
into this, "said Elmyr...

12:18.370 --> 12:20.964
"I spit on his face."

12:21.073 --> 12:24.304
This was later, of course,
when everything was finally hanging out...

12:24.410 --> 12:27.004
or as much of it as I guess
any of us will ever get to see.

12:27.113 --> 12:32.278
And then we had to stop these Moviolas,
use them as time machines...

12:32.384 --> 12:34.147
and then roll back and come in again...

12:34.253 --> 12:37.450
to the days when Clifford Irving,
as far as any of us knew...

12:37.556 --> 12:41.754
- was just a researcher into someone else's fakery.
- [Cuckoo clock cuckoos]

12:41.861 --> 12:43.886
And now for the truth, Clifford.

12:45.064 --> 12:48.124
We'd like to ask you a few question.

12:48.234 --> 12:52.967
My personal feelings
about Elmyr are... very mixed.

12:53.072 --> 12:55.370
He has developed
a fiction about his life...

12:55.474 --> 12:57.374
and to destroy that fiction...

12:57.476 --> 13:01.674
would tear down the whole castle
that he's built...

13:01.781 --> 13:03.681
of his illusions.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.809
The illusion, for example,
that he has not broken any law.

13:06.919 --> 13:08.819
As long as people enjoy it...

13:08.921 --> 13:11.481
and it gives them pleasure,
why shouldn't they have it?

13:11.590 --> 13:15.617
The illusion that the world
has always taken advantage of him.

13:15.728 --> 13:18.526
- Why they shouldn't have it? Why?
- If you were to put it to Elmyr...

13:18.631 --> 13:20.565
that he had taken advantage
of the world...

13:20.666 --> 13:22.896
that he had cheated people,
he'd be horrified.

13:23.002 --> 13:26.836
[Welles] these two
have made each other famous.

13:26.939 --> 13:29.806
They have much in common:

13:29.909 --> 13:32.776
- One of them is talent.
- [Moviola rattling]

13:32.878 --> 13:34.937
Well, let's start again.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.549
We'll patch this film together...

13:38.651 --> 13:43.520
and we'll try to patch together
Elmyr's version of this story.

13:43.622 --> 13:45.988
[Elmyr]
I came to Ibiza in 1959...

13:46.091 --> 13:50.858
after I found certain aspects
of my life in America...

13:50.963 --> 13:53.158
becoming too difficult.

13:53.265 --> 13:56.029
I wandered around Europe for a time.

13:56.135 --> 13:59.502
I eventually came here.
I liked life here.

13:59.605 --> 14:03.666
I liked the island.
I liked the atmosphere. I liked the people.

14:03.776 --> 14:07.542
And so I decided that is the place
where I want to settle.

14:07.646 --> 14:11.582
The island is, uh, simpatico...

14:11.684 --> 14:13.948
as they say in Chinese.

14:14.053 --> 14:17.887
There is always a group
of interesting people here.

14:17.990 --> 14:21.756
Uh, I find the people amusing.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.295
Sandy, come and say something witty.

14:24.396 --> 14:27.263
[Elmyr] Ibiza is not a place
for snobbish society.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.699
It's not London.
It's not Paris. It's not Omaha.

14:30.803 --> 14:34.000
It is Ibiza, and that's
the charm of Ibiza.

14:34.106 --> 14:36.802
That's what makes Ibiza
why we like to live here.

14:36.909 --> 14:40.072
Ibiza is Ibiza, and here people
are themselves, you know...

14:40.179 --> 14:43.637
doing rather strange things
all the time, you know.

14:43.749 --> 14:45.580
So they shouldn't really be shocked.

14:45.684 --> 14:50.815
- And, uh, everybody minds everybody
else's business very intensely.
- [No audible dialogue]

14:50.923 --> 14:55.121
[Man]
Several months ago, I read an article...

14:55.227 --> 14:57.718
about Elmyr de hory...

14:57.830 --> 15:00.390
and I was so impressed...

15:00.499 --> 15:03.593
that I decided to come from Minnesota...

15:03.702 --> 15:05.602
to Ibiza...

15:05.704 --> 15:07.604
in the hope of meeting Elmyr.

15:07.706 --> 15:10.937
And now I have become...

15:11.043 --> 15:12.943
his bodyguard.

15:13.045 --> 15:16.537
[Welles]
That's mark speaking, Elmyr's friend.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.549
He takes his duties seriously.

15:18.651 --> 15:23.281
Elmyr himself swears that he goes
in daily dread of being murdered.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.914
This takes us into murky waters...

15:26.025 --> 15:28.994
where the lawyers tell us
we'd be rash to go fishing.

15:29.094 --> 15:32.996
In fake! There's just a hint or two
about this violence and danger...

15:33.098 --> 15:36.363
as a result of which, Irving,
on top of all his other troubles...

15:36.468 --> 15:41.929
is being sued for
$55 million worth of slander.

15:42.041 --> 15:46.444
Interesting question: Is Clifford Irving
being sued for telling the truth?

15:46.545 --> 15:48.706
What makes a slight legal difference -

15:48.814 --> 15:52.841
well, if you buy the notion that
cliff Irving turned to forgery...

15:52.952 --> 15:55.147
before he turned to Elmyr...

15:55.254 --> 15:58.018
then I guess you can keep right on
through the looking glass...

15:58.123 --> 16:02.457
and believe that his book
about Elmyr is a pack of lies.

16:02.561 --> 16:04.461
I'm sorry.
A lie about what?

16:04.563 --> 16:07.964
That fake.! Is a fake,
and Elmyr himself...

16:08.067 --> 16:10.535
is a fake... faker.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.537
- Fake fakes! [chuckles]
- [Welles] fake, nothing.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.573
Elmyr's a true faker.

16:15.674 --> 16:19.405
Here, for instance,
is a van dongen by Elmyr.

16:19.511 --> 16:21.411
Van dongen studied it carefully...

16:21.513 --> 16:24.038
and then swore that
he'd painted it himself.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.913
He's now known as the greatest
art forger in the world.

16:27.019 --> 16:29.817
Well, I don't admit anything,
I just talk about it.

16:29.922 --> 16:33.688
'Cause he's scared. You know, there could
be a jail sentence hanging over his head.

16:33.792 --> 16:35.817
[Welles]
"Elmyr,"cries a french newspaper...

16:35.928 --> 16:38.362
"has sold his soul to the devil."

16:38.464 --> 16:40.159
They said that about
a wizard of the fiddle.

16:40.265 --> 16:42.495
Elmyr's another wizard
of another sort of fiddle-

16:42.601 --> 16:44.592
a true Paganini of the palette.

16:44.703 --> 16:48.935
It's no wonder
that a faker like Elmyr...

16:49.041 --> 16:51.942
can get away with it for 22 years.

16:52.044 --> 16:55.411
If you hang them in a museum
or your collection of great paintings...

16:55.514 --> 16:58.449
and if they hang long enough there,
they become real.

16:58.550 --> 17:00.450
[Irving] because there's always
a market for it.

17:00.552 --> 17:02.884
[Welles] how much is that drawing worth
on the market today?

17:02.988 --> 17:06.617
[Elmyr]
Probably around $8,000 till $10,000.

17:06.724 --> 17:09.090
[Irving] to my knowledge,
he has never made a mistake...

17:09.194 --> 17:11.992
when identifying a painting.

17:12.097 --> 17:16.590
- [Welles] what period is that Matisse?
- [Elmyr] uh, '36.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.762
I, uh, feel that we should burn it.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.035
[Irving] when he looks at a painting-
a Matisse, a Chagall-

17:23.142 --> 17:26.839
and says, "that's mine, I did it,"
he is always right.

17:26.944 --> 17:29.140
[Welles]
Elmyr.

17:29.248 --> 17:32.046
There is just no way
of talking about Elmyr...

17:32.151 --> 17:34.278
and leaving out cliff Irving.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.411
Not any longer.
Right up to the finish...

17:36.522 --> 17:41.391
Elmyr plays a very important role
in his biographer's own story.

17:41.493 --> 17:44.860
Now, just here, of course,
he's stage center.

17:44.963 --> 17:46.954
Willkommen.! Willkommen.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.091
[Welles] and Irving,
who, I'll have to admit...

17:49.201 --> 17:51.669
is a much better magician than I am...

17:51.770 --> 17:55.331
has yet to transform himself
before our very eyes...

17:55.441 --> 17:58.001
into a superstar.

17:58.110 --> 18:02.513
François, you know,
we talk about your shirt, Reichenbach.

18:02.614 --> 18:04.912
It was indecently ugly.

18:05.017 --> 18:09.010
- [Laughing]
- I can assure you.

18:10.889 --> 18:13.050
[Speaking french]

18:13.158 --> 18:16.616
- [Irving] I must tell you something.
I went to the airport today.
- Oh.

18:16.728 --> 18:20.630
I picked up a copy of
the London daily express.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.567
And there was an article:

18:23.669 --> 18:26.797
"Exposed: A man who holds
the art world to ransom."

18:26.905 --> 18:29.965
- [Woman] exposed.! Darling,
we can't have you exposed.!
- "Sitting in the sunny studio -"

18:30.075 --> 18:32.703
[speaking french]

18:32.811 --> 18:36.338
[Irving] and then it goes on to tell
the story of how I took the Modigliani...

18:36.448 --> 18:39.076
- to the metropolitan museum of art"-
- there's a big article!

18:39.184 --> 18:43.211
"A profound embarrassment to them all."

18:43.322 --> 18:47.622
Elmyr is a profound
embarrassment to them all.

18:47.726 --> 18:50.957
[Speaking french]

18:51.997 --> 18:54.795
The art world,
as it were, has been...

18:56.101 --> 18:58.001
a huge confidence trick.

18:58.103 --> 19:02.403
"Exposed: A man who holds
the art world to ransom."

19:02.508 --> 19:04.738
[Woman laughing]

19:04.843 --> 19:08.904
- "Sitting in the sunny studio
of his £60,000 villa...
- it's fantastic.

19:09.014 --> 19:11.073
"On the Mediterranean island of Ibiza...

19:11.183 --> 19:14.778
"it took Elmyr dory-boutin,
the world's greatest art forger...

19:14.887 --> 19:18.220
just one hour to draw
an original Modigliani."

19:18.323 --> 19:21.417
Today, on a sale,
it would bring somewhere around...

19:23.028 --> 19:24.655
$15,000.

19:24.863 --> 19:27.388
There was really no time
when he ever could have done it.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.866
And also as a man,
how I knew him...

19:30.969 --> 19:32.869
it was all much more a joke.

19:32.971 --> 19:36.873
[Welles] the world has yet to hear a word
about that wig she wore in the Swiss bank.

19:36.975 --> 19:39.535
There hasn't been a breath
about funny passports...

19:39.645 --> 19:42.375
or phony signatures,
and here's Edith...

19:42.481 --> 19:44.949
telling Clifford Irving
that she can't believe Elmyr...

19:45.050 --> 19:47.041
had anything to do with fakery.

19:47.152 --> 19:49.950
[Edith] therefore I never could think
or will even think now...

19:50.055 --> 19:53.547
that he sat down
and did those paintings.

19:53.659 --> 19:55.559
- [Elmyr] it's a good drawing.
- [Edith] If he did it, my compliment.

19:55.661 --> 20:01.065
- Should we burn it?
- [Edith] and I only hope
there are more people who do them.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.596
[Welles]
Irving's book about Elmyr...

20:06.705 --> 20:10.471
is the story of a man of talent taking the
mickey out of those who had rejected him...

20:10.576 --> 20:14.034
translating disappointments
into a gigantic joke.

20:14.146 --> 20:19.140
- [Laughing]
- You think I should keep it
for my old age? [chuckles]

20:22.821 --> 20:26.882
All right, I will.
So I put it back in.

20:26.992 --> 20:29.961
[Irving] you're a painter.
Why do you want people to do fakes?

20:30.062 --> 20:32.189
Because the fakes
are as good as the real ones...

20:32.297 --> 20:34.663
and there's a market,
and there's a demand.

20:34.766 --> 20:38.964
If you didn't have an art market,
then fakers could not exist.

20:40.839 --> 20:44.605
- So, the more, the better. No?
- [Irving] if you say so.

20:44.710 --> 20:47.144
[Welles]
Here's another little coincidence.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.146
A peculiar moment during a lunch party.

20:49.248 --> 20:54.049
And in Switzerland,
checks are not accepted.

20:54.152 --> 20:57.918
You pay cash on the table.

20:58.023 --> 21:01.151
- That's Switzerland. You are Swiss.
- [Laughing]

21:01.260 --> 21:03.353
And you know it.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.828
[Edith] if you did those paintings,
my compliments.

21:05.931 --> 21:09.867
And I only think it's a pity that
there are not more people like you.

21:09.968 --> 21:14.405
And we only pray that
he doesn't exist again.!

21:14.506 --> 21:17.771
[Man on TV] Mrs. Irving now claims
Mr. Hughes himself asked Mrs. Irving...

21:17.876 --> 21:21.368
to deposit the money in a Swiss bank
and then draw it out.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.176
The manuscript itself, however...

21:24.283 --> 21:26.183
he maintains is genuine.

21:27.386 --> 21:29.786
I've known Elmyr for about eight years.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.755
We met when I was broke -

21:32.858 --> 21:36.225
when I was writing fiction
and wasn't selling it very well.

21:37.496 --> 21:39.259
[Welles]
His fiction didn't sell.

21:39.364 --> 21:42.231
Elmyr's biographer
is a highly gifted writer.

21:42.334 --> 21:44.427
Does it say something
for this age of ours...

21:44.536 --> 21:47.801
- that he could only make it big by fakery?
- Je crois.

21:47.906 --> 21:52.900
- That a hoax has made him
the most famous writer in the world?
- La grande suprise.

21:53.011 --> 21:55.070
[Welles] cliff Irving's caper
may well be the hoax of the century...

21:55.180 --> 22:00.174
but really, this is not, you know,
in any way, the century of the hoax.

22:00.285 --> 22:02.981
We hanky-panky men
have always been with you.

22:03.088 --> 22:05.488
- That's a fact.
- [Welles] what's new are the-
- [Irving] the experts.

22:05.590 --> 22:08.184
- [Welles] the experts.
- [Elmyr] the so-called experts.

22:08.293 --> 22:12.093
- [Welles] experts are the new oracles.
- While greatly pretentious -

22:12.197 --> 22:15.496
they speak to us with the absolute
authority of the computer.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.500
Pretend to know something...

22:17.602 --> 22:20.901
what they only know
very superficially.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.974
And we bow down before them.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.407
They're god's own gift to the faker.

22:25.510 --> 22:28.946
All the world loves to see...

22:29.047 --> 22:32.813
the experts and the establishment
made a fool of.

22:32.918 --> 22:34.909
[Elmyr]
Let's say we could find...

22:35.020 --> 22:38.751
a Modigliani made by Kisling...

22:38.857 --> 22:41.883
a Modigliani by Elmyr...

22:42.928 --> 22:45.522
and one Modigliani by Modigliani.

22:45.630 --> 22:51.466
It could be anyone from Knoedler
to Paris or any of the great ones...

22:51.570 --> 22:55.597
who consider themselves
great and experts.

22:55.707 --> 22:59.973
If any of them recognize
which one is which -

23:00.078 --> 23:01.978
[welles]
And if the lawyers would just let us...

23:02.080 --> 23:05.379
we could name you
one highly respected museum...

23:05.484 --> 23:09.386
which boasts of an important collection
of postimpressionists...

23:09.488 --> 23:13.254
every single one of which
was painted by Elmyr.

23:13.358 --> 23:17.021
Elmyr, as the great faker
of the 20th century...

23:17.129 --> 23:20.428
becomes a modern folk hero
for the rest of us...

23:20.532 --> 23:23.592
who have a bit of larceny
in ourselves...

23:23.702 --> 23:28.469
but simply don't have the courage
or the opportunity to express it.

23:28.573 --> 23:33.010
When you wrote his biography, you don't
think you've been a little hard on him?

23:33.111 --> 23:36.808
Some people even say, "after I did read
the book of Clifford Irving about you...

23:36.915 --> 23:38.815
I like you even more than before."

23:38.917 --> 23:44.150
You exploded the myth
of the infallibility...

23:44.256 --> 23:47.657
of the art dealers
and museum directors...

23:47.759 --> 23:51.024
in that you exposed
their crookedness...

23:51.129 --> 23:53.791
their evilness and viciousness.

23:55.867 --> 23:58.700
I went around to the art galleries.

23:59.905 --> 24:02.999
Not with my book...

24:03.108 --> 24:06.077
but with a catalog...

24:06.178 --> 24:08.908
which included
a great many paintings...

24:09.014 --> 24:11.278
that had been sold
over the past few years.

24:12.317 --> 24:15.616
In this catalog was this Modigliani...

24:15.720 --> 24:18.211
which is a Modigliani by Elmyr.

24:18.323 --> 24:20.883
He worked very little.
He died very early...

24:20.992 --> 24:25.292
so if they're added to
a few paintings, a few drawings...

24:25.397 --> 24:27.991
it's not going to destroy his oeuvre.

24:28.099 --> 24:29.999
I would say, "this is a fake"...

24:30.101 --> 24:32.695
and the art gallery owner
would say, "well, yes, of course.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.965
"I mean, you can see it's a fake,
because Modigliani...

24:35.073 --> 24:37.234
"would never have drawn
the line of the arm...

24:37.342 --> 24:39.936
"parallel to the line
of the dress that way.

24:40.045 --> 24:43.845
And the background is very badly done,
and the signature isn't right."

24:43.949 --> 24:48.613
In the next gallery, I would show them
this Modigliani in the catalog and say...

24:48.720 --> 24:51.018
- "that's a genuine Modigliani."
- [Elmyr] possibly, yes.

24:51.122 --> 24:54.990
And they would look at it and say,
"yes, you can see it's one of his finest.

24:55.093 --> 24:57.391
"It's a portrait of mademoiselle hébuterne,"

24:57.496 --> 25:00.056
and "we know it very well,"
and "it's reproduced everywhere."

25:00.165 --> 25:02.633
After that, I must say...

25:02.734 --> 25:06.830
I lost my faith
in the concept of expertise.

25:06.938 --> 25:10.601
I don't feel bad for Modigliani.
I feel good for me.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.706
[Welles] you name them.
He paints them.

25:14.813 --> 25:16.610
He'll do you a dufy,
a van dongen...

25:16.715 --> 25:20.845
a derain, a braque,
a bonnard, a vlaminck.

25:20.952 --> 25:24.786
- Would you like a nice Matisse?
- [Elmyr] many of these drawings...

25:26.358 --> 25:28.349
are very weak.

25:28.460 --> 25:31.623
Matisse's lines
were never that sure as mine.

25:31.730 --> 25:35.860
He was hesitant when he made
the drawing, you know?

25:35.967 --> 25:40.301
He added to it a little more
and a little more.

25:40.405 --> 25:44.136
It wasn't as flowing,
it wasn't as sure as mine.

25:44.242 --> 25:46.210
I had to hesitate...

25:48.513 --> 25:51.175
to make it more Matisse-like.

25:52.517 --> 25:53.984
Et voilà()()

25:54.085 --> 25:57.612
I would like to see any expert...

25:57.722 --> 26:00.953
or any museum director,
or any art dealer...

26:01.059 --> 26:05.120
who'd know which one is a Matisse...

26:06.865 --> 26:09.231
and which one is by Elmyr.

26:12.137 --> 26:15.334
And I am ready
to accept the challenge.

26:16.441 --> 26:18.341
[Welles]
One nod from an expert...

26:18.443 --> 26:20.502
and that piece of canvas
would be worth...

26:20.612 --> 26:23.638
maybe a couple of
hundred thousand dollars.

26:23.748 --> 26:28.947
And now, with your permission,
a bit of verse... by Kipling.

26:33.592 --> 26:38.291
"When first the flush of a newborn sun
fell on the green and gold...

26:39.431 --> 26:44.198
"our father, Adam, sat under the tree...

26:44.302 --> 26:48.568
"and scratched with a stick
in the mold.

26:52.944 --> 26:58.041
"And the first rude sketch
that the world had seen...

26:58.149 --> 27:00.709
"was joy to his mighty heart.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.720
"Till the devil...

27:03.822 --> 27:06.723
"whispered behind the leaves...

27:08.126 --> 27:11.562
"'it's pretty, but is it art?"'

27:13.665 --> 27:17.863
It's pretty, but is it art?
Well, how is it valued?

27:17.969 --> 27:21.735
The value depends on opinion.
Opinion depends on the experts.

27:21.840 --> 27:25.901
A faker like Elmyr makes fools of
the experts, so who's the expert?

27:27.012 --> 27:29.742
- Who's the faker?
- [Elmyr] I know one thing.

27:29.848 --> 27:33.477
I never offered a painting
or a drawing...

27:33.585 --> 27:36.383
to a museum who didn't buy it.

27:36.488 --> 27:40.049
They never refused one. Never.!

27:40.158 --> 27:44.026
[Welles] what's he up to now?
This- this isn't a forgery.

27:44.129 --> 27:47.428
No, not this time.
This is a portrait by Elmyr...

27:48.533 --> 27:52.128
- Et voilà()()
- Of another famous art forger.

27:52.237 --> 27:55.035
- Michel-ange.
- [Welles] Michelangelo, no less, signed-

27:55.140 --> 27:57.438
[chuckles]
I must say I'm honored.

27:57.542 --> 28:01.342
My signature,
forged by Elmyr on a real Elmyr...

28:01.446 --> 28:03.346
is really something.

28:03.448 --> 28:06.975
You know, art forgery
used to be admired as an art.

28:07.085 --> 28:11.317
And though Michelangelo even used smoke
on some of his fakes to antique them...

28:11.423 --> 28:14.153
like some of the rest of us,
he finally went straight.

28:14.259 --> 28:16.159
[Elmyr]
Et voilà()()

28:16.961 --> 28:20.397
[Welles]
Elmyr, reformed...

28:20.498 --> 28:23.763
and exposed-
in the reverse order-

28:23.868 --> 28:27.463
was till just recently
the island's number-one celebrity.

28:27.572 --> 28:30.700
But now the crown has passed
from the old emperor of the hoax...

28:30.809 --> 28:32.709
to the pretender.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.711
Tomorrow at the party.
There's a big party.

28:34.813 --> 28:37.577
- Don't miss it. Tomorrow at 8:00.
- [Woman] what time?

28:37.682 --> 28:42.483
[Welles] the ex-grand master of fakery,
not only unmasked, but eclipsed...

28:42.587 --> 28:44.487
by his own biographer...

28:44.589 --> 28:46.614
is putting a brave face on it...

28:46.725 --> 28:49.751
- and giving another party.
- Eight o'clock.

28:49.861 --> 28:51.658
[Woman]
At your house?

28:51.763 --> 28:54.561
- [Welles] and here...
- I come to invite you for a big party.

28:54.666 --> 28:56.600
[Welles]
Yet another painter from Ibiza.

28:56.701 --> 29:00.660
Life hired him to illustrate
the tale as Irving told it.

29:00.772 --> 29:04.674
Nice to see you. Great.
Hello, David.

29:04.776 --> 29:06.937
[Welles]
David Walsh.

29:07.045 --> 29:09.843
And this is his impression,
based on Irving's report...

29:09.948 --> 29:13.406
of that secret meeting on the Mexican
pyramid with Howard Hughes.

29:13.518 --> 29:16.009
Here's how he's supposed
to have looked...

29:16.121 --> 29:19.454
based on Irving's reports of those secret
meetings which in fact never happened.

29:19.557 --> 29:21.457
But who cared about facts?

29:21.559 --> 29:24.687
Was Mr. Hughes a vegetable?
A spook?

29:24.796 --> 29:27.594
A gibbering lunatic?
Was his hair down to his knees?

29:27.699 --> 29:29.826
Were his fingernails nine inches long?

29:29.934 --> 29:32.334
Did Howard Hughes exist?

29:32.437 --> 29:36.498
Irving insisted that he did.
Hughes denied the existence of Irving.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.042
[Man on phone]
No, and I never saw him.
I never even heard of him.

29:39.144 --> 29:40.839
[Welles] "don't believe a word of it,"
said Irving.

29:40.945 --> 29:43.311
And believe it or not,
almost nobody did.

29:43.414 --> 29:46.383
Why, they were partners,
Hughes and Irving, said Irving.

29:46.484 --> 29:50.318
They were doing a book together.
Now the Hughes mystery would be solved.

29:51.956 --> 29:56.052
Now, of course Irving knew very well
that whatever made Hughes a mystery...

29:56.161 --> 29:59.062
was whatever had made Hughes himself
a born mystery maker.

29:59.164 --> 30:04.192
Here in the smoggy wonderland of Hollywood
is where I last had to talk to him.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.293
It was 5:00 in the morning
25 years ago.

30:06.404 --> 30:10.340
And I found him, as usual,
very bright, and pleasant, and polite.

30:10.441 --> 30:13.740
Well, now this is like most
of the Hughes legends.

30:13.845 --> 30:16.143
It's just something you hear,
and nothing you can prove...

30:16.247 --> 30:19.512
but for what it's worth,
it seems that hotel bungalow...

30:19.617 --> 30:24.611
was supposedly the H.Q. Of that rather
spooky brigade of midnight minions...

30:24.722 --> 30:27.691
we used to call
"Howard's secret police."

30:29.694 --> 30:31.662
That's where that tree comes in.

30:31.763 --> 30:35.290
Just precisely there, at 1:30 every morning,
for who knows how many years...

30:35.400 --> 30:39.496
some chosen operative placed,
at precisely the same angle...

30:39.604 --> 30:43.938
a small and very carefully
wrapped package.

30:44.042 --> 30:48.570
Howard Hughes in his nocturnal
wanderings never once paused there...

30:49.614 --> 30:53.573
but it was always ready for him
in case he should.

30:53.685 --> 30:58.145
What was it that
that mystery package contained?

30:59.757 --> 31:01.657
A ham sandwich.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.721
[Clock ticking]

31:06.831 --> 31:08.731
How can we believe that is true?

31:08.833 --> 31:10.562
[Welles] François is referring,
of course, to Elmyr.

31:10.668 --> 31:12.659
But about Hughes...

31:12.770 --> 31:14.965
well, who could blame
cliff Irving for believing...

31:15.073 --> 31:19.908
that Hughes himself wanted us
to believe almost anything?

31:20.011 --> 31:24.277
Look where we are now. When the old
Hollywood swinger turned hermit...

31:24.382 --> 31:27.818
- this is the hermitage he picked-his hideaway...
- [roulette wheel spinning]

31:27.919 --> 31:30.149
- His desert retreat.
- [Coins spilling from slot machine]

31:30.255 --> 31:32.155
The desert had retreated first,
of course...

31:32.257 --> 31:35.954
to make room for the slot machines
and the crap tables.

31:36.060 --> 31:40.292
Then came Hughes. He chased out
or bought off most of the Mafia...

31:40.398 --> 31:43.890
bought up most of the hotels,
and settled down up there...

31:44.002 --> 31:46.800
in a few rooms in the top floor
of that one.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.237
And all through the long years...

31:49.340 --> 31:53.106
not a shadow was seen
moving in that window.

31:53.211 --> 31:56.908
The good people of Las Vegas
kept their eyes peeled, saw nothing...

31:57.015 --> 31:59.142
and believed everything
they told each other.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.185
More than one bemused observer...

32:02.287 --> 32:04.812
claims to have seen
the whimsical tycoon...

32:04.923 --> 32:08.051
at 4:00 in the morning,
promenading this highway...

32:08.159 --> 32:10.184
with no socks on...

32:10.295 --> 32:13.093
and wearing, instead of shoes...

32:13.197 --> 32:17.258
a pair of empty Kleenex boxes.

32:17.368 --> 32:19.336
Do I believe that?
[Chuckling]

32:19.437 --> 32:23.703
But people pretend to be shocked.
They like to be shocked, you know.

32:23.808 --> 32:25.969
It's in their nature.
It's in human nature, you know.

32:26.077 --> 32:28.511
What was he doing up there?

32:28.613 --> 32:31.980
What were they doing to him?

32:35.887 --> 32:38.355
If he broke his silence,
would it be a...

32:40.291 --> 32:42.919
cry for help?

32:44.963 --> 32:48.126
Well, if Hughes couldn't speak,
or wouldn't...

32:48.232 --> 32:50.632
then somebody-
and why not Clifford Irving-

32:50.735 --> 32:53.067
could do the speaking for him.

32:53.171 --> 32:57.073
Nobody got near the man.
Just a tiny band of mystery Mormons...

32:57.175 --> 32:59.075
were admitted to his presence.

32:59.177 --> 33:01.338
Even high executives
in the Hughes empire...

33:01.446 --> 33:03.346
never so much as laid eyes on him.

33:03.448 --> 33:07.009
One man alone laid claim to
having made it into that fortress...

33:07.118 --> 33:09.143
and you can guess who that was.

33:09.253 --> 33:12.711
How had Irving got to Hughes
in the first place? "simple,"said Irving.

33:12.824 --> 33:16.282
He'd just mailed him a copy of fake!
With a friendly, sincere dedication...

33:16.394 --> 33:18.294
and the partnership was formed.

33:18.396 --> 33:21.263
And if you can believe the ham sandwich
and the Kleenex boxes...

33:21.366 --> 33:23.596
I guess you can swallow that.

33:23.701 --> 33:26.226
[Man on telephone] I mean,
this episode is just so fantastic...

33:26.337 --> 33:29.864
that it taxes your imagination...

33:29.974 --> 33:32.306
to believe that a thing
like this could happen.

33:32.410 --> 33:36.608
Was that the voice
of the real Howard Hughes?

33:36.714 --> 33:38.614
I only wish I was still
in the movie business.

33:38.716 --> 33:40.547
[Welles]
Well, now he's on television...

33:40.651 --> 33:44.451
and a committee of journalists
are interviewing his voice.

33:44.555 --> 33:46.614
[Man]
No, I don't remember any scripts...

33:46.724 --> 33:49.716
as wild or as stretching
of the imagination...

33:49.827 --> 33:52.796
as this yarn has turned out to be.

33:53.064 --> 33:56.898
Now remember how this went.
Irving announced that Hughes had decided...

33:57.001 --> 33:59.629
that Irving was just
the writer he could trust...

33:59.737 --> 34:02.205
not only with his book,
but with the money for it.

34:02.306 --> 34:04.797
And this involved an advance of some
three-quarters of a million dollars...

34:04.909 --> 34:07.207
and he had notes, memos
and manuscripts in what he claimed...

34:07.311 --> 34:09.210
was Hughes's own handwriting to prove it.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.543
Now they brought in
the handwriting experts.

34:11.649 --> 34:15.277
Now just here Irving should have
been feeling a bit nervous.

34:15.386 --> 34:18.719
Well, maybe he was
just as cool as he acted...

34:18.822 --> 34:21.223
remembering what he'd learned
from the old maestro himself.

34:21.324 --> 34:23.225
Elmyr was a good teacher,
if only by example...

34:23.327 --> 34:25.795
and his most valuable lesson was this:

34:25.897 --> 34:28.092
Don't be spooked by the experts.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.895
[Elmyr] my opinion about experts is
that it's something far too overestimated.

34:31.002 --> 34:33.766
It's a métier which
shouldn't even exist.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.498
And how right he was!

34:35.606 --> 34:40.771
It should not exist that one
single person makes a decision...

34:40.878 --> 34:42.777
about what's good or what's bad.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.780
Sure enough,
after much study and analysis...

34:44.882 --> 34:48.579
the experts on handwriting
handed in their verdict.

34:48.686 --> 34:51.416
The forgeries were genuine.
The proof, and I quote, was "irresistible...

34:51.522 --> 34:53.853
unanswerable, and overwhelming."

34:55.193 --> 34:59.027
Thus Irving's papers,
like Elmyr's paintings...

34:59.130 --> 35:01.598
were authenticated.

35:01.699 --> 35:06.602
I wanted to find out what it was really like
to try and get an expertise on a fake...

35:06.704 --> 35:08.831
and I asked Elmyr to do
three drawings for me:

35:08.940 --> 35:10.840
Two Matisse and a Modigliani -

35:10.942 --> 35:13.035
which he did before lunch...

35:13.144 --> 35:15.772
and put a little coffee stain
on the edge of the Modigliani...

35:15.880 --> 35:20.214
to make it look really as if Modigliani
had done it in some Paris café()()

35:20.318 --> 35:24.015
- [Chuckling]
- I then took the three drawings
to the museum of modern art.

35:24.122 --> 35:27.614
The museum examined them
for two hours...

35:27.725 --> 35:30.785
and came back with the verdict
that they were absolutely genuine...

35:30.895 --> 35:33.591
and, in fact, were horrified
that I wanted to sell them.

35:33.698 --> 35:36.929
Besides, it's a true story.
The story's absolutely true.

35:38.236 --> 35:41.205
Well, Mr. Irving pretends
that he destroyed them.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.205
I don't think that
Mr. Irving's character...

35:43.307 --> 35:46.799
is exactly a character
who would destroy something...

35:46.911 --> 35:49.903
what he got an offer of 15,000.

35:50.014 --> 35:53.506
I think it's a nice security
in a bank vault...

35:53.618 --> 35:56.644
what could be unwrapped
in 15 years again.

35:56.754 --> 35:58.654
All the tales he tells now...

35:58.756 --> 36:01.816
are things that he has built up
in his imagination over the years...

36:01.926 --> 36:03.826
and come to believe as true.

36:03.928 --> 36:06.954
[Welles]
"The tale is as old as the Eden tree-

36:07.064 --> 36:09.032
"and new as the new-cut tooth-

36:09.133 --> 36:12.899
"for each man knows
ere his lip-thatch grows...

36:13.004 --> 36:16.701
he is master of art and truth."

36:16.807 --> 36:21.710
[Irving] this created in him,
I think, the ability to live-

36:21.812 --> 36:25.270
I hesitate to say, a criminal life,
because I don't think of him as a criminal.

36:25.383 --> 36:29.012
- [Speaking french]
- He doesn't think of himself as a criminal.

36:29.120 --> 36:34.456
To fool, once in a while,
somebody very, very pompous...

36:34.559 --> 36:36.493
- or somebody very-
- pretentious.

36:36.594 --> 36:38.858
[Elmyr]
Pretentious, that, I like.

36:38.963 --> 36:41.022
[Irving]
Now that it's out in the open...

36:41.132 --> 36:44.192
that the world knows
who Elmyr is and what he's done...

36:44.302 --> 36:47.965
and now that Elmyr accepts it
and says to the world...

36:48.072 --> 36:52.008
"yes, it's me. I am the great
art forger of the 20th century."

36:52.109 --> 36:56.739
Now I think he can recapture
that personal honesty.

36:56.847 --> 37:00.283
- [Elmyr] good-bye, Matisse.
- I think Elmyr's problem for years...

37:00.384 --> 37:04.514
and the reason why he could not succeed
as a painter in his own right...

37:04.622 --> 37:08.080
was that the type of life he led...

37:08.192 --> 37:11.320
prohibited him from
having a personal vision.

37:11.429 --> 37:14.296
[Welles] "and each man hears
as the twilight nears...

37:14.398 --> 37:17.697
"to the beat of his dying heart...

37:17.802 --> 37:20.464
"the devil drum
on the darkened pane:

37:23.040 --> 37:25.008
"'It's pretty...

37:25.109 --> 37:28.101
but was it art?"'

37:28.212 --> 37:30.680
[Crew member]
Art. Take two.

37:30.781 --> 37:32.681
[Irving] and when an artist
has no personal vision...

37:32.783 --> 37:34.648
what can he communicate
onto the canvas?

37:34.752 --> 37:38.279
[Speaking french]

37:38.389 --> 37:40.653
- [Speaking french]
- Et voilà()()

37:42.893 --> 37:46.954
It's pretty, but is it rare?

37:47.064 --> 37:49.999
Lots of oysters, only a few pearls.

37:52.236 --> 37:56.673
The chief cause and encouragement
of fakery and phoniness in everything...

37:56.774 --> 37:59.106
even what we're given to eat-

37:59.210 --> 38:01.804
an awful lot of forgery is committed
these days in the kitchen.

38:01.912 --> 38:04.676
Oja?

38:07.885 --> 38:11.821
[Sighs] the seafood
isn't phony in here, thank god.

38:11.922 --> 38:13.856
You can take the word
of an expert.

38:13.958 --> 38:17.394
Three friends from the old days
who used to eat here were real painters:

38:17.495 --> 38:20.464
Jean Cocteau,
the poet and filmmaker-

38:20.564 --> 38:22.532
well, you might call him
a Monday painter.

38:22.633 --> 38:25.625
He drew the picture on the menu
and signed his name, as you know...

38:25.736 --> 38:27.704
to a whole epoch.

38:27.805 --> 38:30.171
Here on the walls
are samples of the famous charm...

38:30.274 --> 38:32.174
of Christian Bernard-
"baby,"as we called him.

38:32.276 --> 38:35.575
And speaking of charm,
here's vertès all around us.

38:35.680 --> 38:40.344
Vertès had to be charming.
He was Hungarian.

38:40.451 --> 38:43.147
He started his career-
and he told me this right here at this table-

38:43.254 --> 38:47.918
"as a charlatan.
I painted fake masterpieces.

38:48.025 --> 38:51.688
I began," he said, "as Lautrec."

38:51.796 --> 38:55.232
[Elmyr]
A woman, a titled English woman...

38:55.333 --> 38:57.233
walked in one day to my room...

38:57.335 --> 39:00.532
and she saw on the wall -
pinned on the wall, a drawing.

39:00.638 --> 39:03.539
Say, "hey, where you got that Picasso?"

39:03.641 --> 39:05.905
I say, "well, do you think it's a Picasso?"

39:06.010 --> 39:09.844
"And there was this art dealer" -
I won't give you his name -

39:09.947 --> 39:11.847
"turning down everything I showed him" -

39:11.949 --> 39:15.180
this is vertès speaking-
"when something caught his eye.

39:15.286 --> 39:17.516
"'Where did you get that? ' he said.

39:17.621 --> 39:19.521
"'That nice little Lautrec.'

39:19.623 --> 39:22.057
"I told him it was a very nice
little vertès.

39:22.159 --> 39:25.356
"'I'll take the Lautrec, 'he said.

39:25.463 --> 39:29.923
'And if you happen to find
any more, bring them in."'

39:30.034 --> 39:32.628
[Elmyr] she said, "would you sell it?"
I said, "well, delighted."

39:32.737 --> 39:35.968
And I suddenly realize
I can sell something...

39:36.073 --> 39:40.908
absolutely unexpectedly
for quite a great deal of money...

39:41.011 --> 39:45.141
in a time when I was unable,
but absolutely unable...

39:45.249 --> 39:47.149
to sell any of my paintings.

39:47.251 --> 39:50.049
"How could you blame me?
I had no money in my pocket...

39:50.154 --> 39:53.453
no socks in my shoes,
no real painting style of my own."

39:53.557 --> 39:58.256
[Elmyr] even the amount of five dollars
meant that am I going to eat.

39:58.362 --> 40:01.798
I don't meaning go home
and be full, but to eat.

40:01.899 --> 40:06.734
[Waiter speaking french]

40:06.837 --> 40:10.329
I would like to see that
poor Hungarian refugee...

40:10.441 --> 40:14.275
who would have resisted
of that temptation.

40:15.379 --> 40:17.279
[Welles]
Well, vertès didn't either.

40:17.381 --> 40:20.441
Like all Hungarians,
he told the best Hungarian jokes.

40:20.551 --> 40:22.815
The omelet,
you know that, don't you?

40:22.920 --> 40:25.081
Sure. It's a classic.

40:25.189 --> 40:28.681
An omelet,
it's in our Hungarian cookbook.

40:28.793 --> 40:31.387
"To make an omelet," it says...

40:31.495 --> 40:34.259
"first, steal an egg."

40:34.365 --> 40:37.129
[Elmyr] well, naturally,
to be Hungarian is not a nationality.

40:37.234 --> 40:39.225
It's a profession.

40:39.336 --> 40:41.270
[Welles] but the truth about Hungarians,
which they do try to cover up...

40:41.372 --> 40:44.273
is that they're not any more
crooked than the rest of us.

40:44.375 --> 40:47.503
But not the way they like to tell it.
Of all the Hungarian friends I've ever had...

40:47.611 --> 40:50.705
I can't remember one
who didn't want me to think of him...

40:50.815 --> 40:52.715
as a king of con men.

40:52.817 --> 40:56.253
As for this Hungarian's own tales
of his own lurid past...

40:56.353 --> 40:58.617
they don't,
according to his biographer...

40:58.722 --> 41:01.657
jive exactly with versions
of the same events...

41:01.759 --> 41:06.128
as told by certain art dealers.

41:06.230 --> 41:08.596
I do think art dealers...

41:08.699 --> 41:10.860
are crooked.

41:10.968 --> 41:12.868
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

41:12.970 --> 41:16.462
I put it to you that
between such witnesses...

41:16.574 --> 41:19.668
your choice, to phrase it nicely,
is not easy.

41:19.777 --> 41:25.079
Even if Clifford Irving
mentions in his book that -

41:25.182 --> 41:29.209
I must insist that
I never sell to privates.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.652
Some friend of mine say
you should buy a fantastic drawing...

41:31.755 --> 41:33.655
that own a refugee of Budapest.

41:33.757 --> 41:36.954
"Budapesht." it's not with a "pest."
It's with a "pesht."

41:37.061 --> 41:40.519
He want to sell 10 Modigliani
and 10, uh, Matisse.

41:40.631 --> 41:43.259
At that time,
when I sell to François...

41:43.367 --> 41:46.165
he was not a movie director.

41:46.270 --> 41:48.397
He was an art dealer.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.633
I tried to put it in art gallery.
Then it was an occasion...

41:50.741 --> 41:54.302
- because they were to sell for $200.
- [Welles] "occasion"is a bargain.

41:54.411 --> 41:57.175
[Laughing]

41:57.281 --> 41:59.181
[Welles]
Our whole story really starts, you know...

41:59.283 --> 42:02.377
with two famous collections of paintings.

42:02.486 --> 42:05.284
One belonged to the Reichenbach
and was real...

42:05.389 --> 42:08.517
the other Elmyr was supposed
to have smuggled out of Hungary.

42:08.626 --> 42:11.754
- From his family.
- Oh, no, that's a complete fabrication.

42:11.862 --> 42:14.387
I can tell you exactly who he was.

42:14.498 --> 42:16.693
After the book was published
I got a letter from a man...

42:16.800 --> 42:20.600
who had known him in
a concentration camp in Hungary.

42:20.704 --> 42:22.729
And he said he was not
from the aristocracy...

42:22.840 --> 42:27.573
but that he was from a normal
lower middle-class home...

42:27.678 --> 42:30.374
and since then
has refused to discuss it.

42:30.481 --> 42:33.211
He just evades the subject
whenever it's brought up.

42:33.317 --> 42:35.877
It's terribly convenient,
beside everything else!

42:35.986 --> 42:38.853
[Welles] François bought
some of Elmyr's paintings...

42:38.956 --> 42:42.084
and sold them again in his art gallery
for a couple of fast bucks.

42:42.192 --> 42:43.625
[François]
For double the price.

42:43.727 --> 42:46.059
- [Welles] you sold them for double
what you bought them for?
- Exactly.

42:46.163 --> 42:50.964
Before he did pay me
for the drawings he did buy...

42:51.068 --> 42:53.764
he sold it already
before he paid me.

42:53.871 --> 42:56.237
Then the third year,
I went back and -

42:56.340 --> 42:58.240
he came to see me.
He said, "I have other Modigliani."

42:58.342 --> 43:00.902
- I was a little suspicious.
- [Welles] Elmyr said he has more.

43:01.011 --> 43:05.607
- More, but you see, last time -
- and you thought maybe
that's a little too many Modigliani.

43:05.716 --> 43:08.879
Because the last time he say,
"it's my last one. Take it."

43:08.986 --> 43:11.216
Then, when he had others...

43:11.322 --> 43:14.587
I say, "where they come from?"
But I didn't try to investigate too much.

43:14.692 --> 43:16.592
- But I kept -
- [welles] why didn't you?

43:16.694 --> 43:20.755
- Like everyone.
- [Laughing]

43:20.864 --> 43:22.764
Because they were very-
I didn't want to -

43:22.866 --> 43:25.426
- you didn't want to know.!
- Not too much.

43:25.536 --> 43:28.403
The year after, he call me.
He say, "I have three mores."

43:28.505 --> 43:31.133
- Three more Modigliani.
- I say, "I have already 10 in my rooms.

43:31.241 --> 43:34.438
"I'm not a collector of Modigliani.

43:34.545 --> 43:36.877
"Of course, if you had a dessin-

43:36.981 --> 43:39.347
a portrait of soutine.
I love so much soutine."

43:39.450 --> 43:42.180
- But why did you want a portrait of soutine?
- Because I like soutine.

43:42.286 --> 43:44.754
- I see.
- And I asked to Elmyr if he had one.

43:44.855 --> 43:47.119
He say, "I don't have any soutine
by Modigliani. Why?"

43:47.224 --> 43:49.283
[Welles]
Soutine was a friend of Modigliani.

43:49.393 --> 43:51.293
- Exactement.
- You asked him if he had it.

43:51.395 --> 43:55.092
He say, "I don't have it."
I say, "then keep your three others,
even if they were very cheap."

43:55.199 --> 43:57.360
They were the double price,
but they were still very cheap.

43:58.402 --> 44:01.394
Then the night, during the night,
he call me.

44:01.505 --> 44:04.565
He say, "François, you are a genius.
You guessed I had one."

44:04.675 --> 44:06.575
[Laughing]

44:06.677 --> 44:09.339
"How could you know?
I found one in my drawer.

44:09.446 --> 44:13.109
A beautiful portrait of soutine
by Modigliani."

44:13.217 --> 44:16.084
[Elmyr] and now there's something else
again what I'm doing here.

44:16.186 --> 44:18.677
That is Picasso.

44:20.290 --> 44:22.281
[Welles]
And now the scene changes...

44:22.393 --> 44:24.520
from new york to Pamplona.

44:24.628 --> 44:27.096
This deep in the Hemingway country...

44:27.197 --> 44:29.392
you might not expect to find Elmyr.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.128
And he said,
"I'm going to reimburse you."

44:32.236 --> 44:34.136
- I said, "what are you" -
- reimburse you for what?

44:34.238 --> 44:36.934
- For the fake I sold you.
- Yeah, but you made a lot of money on it.

44:37.041 --> 44:39.271
- Yes, but he didn't know.
- [Chuckling] I see.

44:39.376 --> 44:41.503
And you know what he did?

44:41.612 --> 44:45.173
He gave me a check,
and the check had no money in the bank.

44:45.282 --> 44:46.943
- He gave you a false check.
- Yes.

44:47.051 --> 44:48.484
- For a false painting.
- Yes.

44:48.585 --> 44:50.246
[Welles]
There's a certain justice.

44:50.354 --> 44:52.185
Well...

44:52.289 --> 44:55.053
good-bye, Picasso.

44:55.159 --> 44:58.595
[Welles]
It's a fact of record that art dealers-

44:58.696 --> 45:02.928
would you take this away, please, and -
and bring me the steak au poivre?

45:03.033 --> 45:07.094
Thanks a lot.
That art dealers, either in ignorance...

45:07.204 --> 45:09.263
innocence, or simple greed...

45:09.373 --> 45:12.706
have made themselves fortunes
on the paintings of Elmyr.

45:12.810 --> 45:15.779
I have not the vaguest idea
the money they got.

45:15.879 --> 45:18.439
Those paintings
must have been pretty good...

45:18.549 --> 45:22.280
or the dealers must have been...
pretty bad.

45:22.386 --> 45:26.083
I could not estimate
if it was 10 million, 20 million -

45:26.190 --> 45:30.149
dollars, pounds, uh, zlotys.

45:30.260 --> 45:35.027
A whole lot of them anyway made profits of
a hundred percent and more on these affairs...

45:35.132 --> 45:37.623
and Elmyr himself
has really made very little.

45:37.735 --> 45:42.900
All I got was a little television
of that size for the $250,000.

45:43.006 --> 45:46.407
[Welles]
Even that handsome house of his, that isn't his.

45:46.510 --> 45:48.569
A dealer has a deal with him.

45:48.679 --> 45:52.945
Somebody must have made
some kind of strange -

45:53.050 --> 45:55.245
- [Irving] deal.
- Deal.

45:55.352 --> 45:57.650
[Elmyr]
I was fooled.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.655
I was used.

45:59.757 --> 46:04.524
And I was squeezed out-
squeezed out like the last drop.

46:13.470 --> 46:18.271
Because even the roof of that house
doesn't belong to me.

46:18.375 --> 46:21.970
I don't have a dime to my name.

46:23.514 --> 46:25.539
[Welles]
So after all these long years on the run...

46:25.649 --> 46:31.281
even now,
after his final reformation as a forger...

46:32.389 --> 46:35.881
Elmyr can't feel much real security
in this last refuge...

46:35.993 --> 46:38.461
in what people like to call...

46:38.562 --> 46:41.292
"the golden years."

46:41.398 --> 46:44.196
- [François] a little bit of luck.
- And a dash of larceny.

46:44.501 --> 46:46.492
[Welles] you've been freely
owning up to your own past.

46:46.603 --> 46:48.662
I'd better do some confessing myself.

46:48.772 --> 46:54.301
François was an art dealer, and l-
well, I was an artist.

46:54.411 --> 46:59.178
I thought I was anyway.
Like Elmyr, I too was once a hungry painter.

46:59.283 --> 47:02.514
But not here in France.
No, I was hungry in Ireland.

47:02.619 --> 47:05.747
I'd come there to paint,
bought a donkey and cart...

47:05.856 --> 47:10.225
filled the cart with paints and canvases
and went traveling.

47:10.327 --> 47:13.023
- At night I slept under the cart.
- [Bell tolling]

47:15.065 --> 47:17.158
It was a very nice summer.

47:18.202 --> 47:20.534
But then when I got to Dublin...

47:20.637 --> 47:22.901
the donkey had to go up for auction.

47:23.006 --> 47:25.406
And so did I.
My paintings were gone...

47:25.509 --> 47:28.205
all given away to the Irish farmers
who'd given me food.

47:28.312 --> 47:31.679
I'd run out of paint and money.

47:31.782 --> 47:34.910
I was 16 years old,
and my career, as you might say...

47:35.018 --> 47:36.952
was at the crossroads.

47:37.054 --> 47:39.113
Winter was coming in.

47:42.025 --> 47:44.755
Oh, I guess I could have
found myself an honest job...

47:44.862 --> 47:47.763
as a dishwasher or something,
but, no, I took the easy way.

47:47.865 --> 47:50.197
I went on the stage.

47:50.300 --> 47:52.700
I'd never been on the stage,
but I told them in Dublin...

47:52.803 --> 47:56.239
I was a famous star from new york,
and somehow got them to believe me.

47:56.340 --> 47:58.365
That's how I started.

47:58.475 --> 48:01.000
Began at the top, and have been
working my way down ever since.

48:01.111 --> 48:04.672
If acting is an art, cooking up
that bogus Broadway career...

48:04.781 --> 48:07.272
was a fine case of art forgery.

48:07.384 --> 48:11.115
And then later, on the radio -
well, we've seen how Elmyr started.

48:11.221 --> 48:13.189
In my past there aren't any Picasso.

48:13.290 --> 48:19.058
No. My next flight into fakery
was by flying saucer.

48:21.231 --> 48:23.563
[Saucer whirring]

48:26.703 --> 48:29.137
[Man on radio] we interrupt
this program to bring you a news bulletin.

48:29.239 --> 48:32.140
[Man #2 on radio]
High government sources have ceased to deny...

48:32.242 --> 48:35.075
the presence in many parts of the country
of nonterrestrial objects.

48:35.178 --> 48:38.614
[Man] we return you now to the starlight
terrace of the hotel glory in scranton...

48:38.715 --> 48:43.778
- to the singing strings of
laszlo gabor and his melodeons.
- ## [Orchestral]

48:43.887 --> 48:47.015
[Welles]
On the radio, I got my first job from Paul Stewart...

48:47.124 --> 48:49.957
and we were lucky enough
to have him join us later in the mercury.

48:50.060 --> 48:53.188
Paul was a real capo mafia
in the martian caper.

48:53.297 --> 48:56.664
"The war of the worlds" was
before world war ii, remember.

48:56.767 --> 48:59.292
Before television,
in the great days of radio.

48:59.403 --> 49:01.667
Maybe that's what made it all possible.

49:01.772 --> 49:03.501
[Man on radio]
Another bulletin, ladies and gentlemen.

49:03.607 --> 49:06.132
The latest word on the monsters
from outer space.

49:06.243 --> 49:07.938
[Man # 2] correction, from mars.

49:08.045 --> 49:12.106
Sorry, folks, that's what experts are saying.
They are martians.

49:12.215 --> 49:15.207
[Welles] TV would have shown us up.
Half the population...

49:15.319 --> 49:17.446
got the screaming jeebies
just because they couldn't see...

49:17.554 --> 49:20.546
how silly it all would have looked.

49:20.657 --> 49:23.455
[Stewart] we said that the martians
were releasing a noxious gas...

49:23.560 --> 49:27.621
across the jersey meadows
that was drifting towards new york.

49:27.731 --> 49:29.858
So, people took to the hills.

49:33.904 --> 49:36.065
[Welles]
I met a welfare worker years later...

49:36.173 --> 49:40.234
who told me he spent weeks trying to woo
some of the refugees back to civilization.

49:40.344 --> 49:43.040
[Man on radio] the entire state
of new jersey has now been cordoned off.

49:43.146 --> 49:45.706
State highways- uh, yes?

49:45.816 --> 49:47.977
Ladies and gentlemen,
a special news flash from Washington.

49:48.085 --> 49:50.383
Any moment now,
president Roosevelt will be receiving...

49:50.487 --> 49:52.512
a delegation from mars.

49:52.622 --> 49:55.056
From mars.
Peace talks are expected-

49:59.196 --> 50:00.925
[welles]
A woman-you just have to believe this-

50:01.031 --> 50:05.730
rushed into a police station out in San Francisco
with her clothes in tatters...

50:05.836 --> 50:09.499
to report that she'd been
repeatedly attacked by martians.

50:11.975 --> 50:13.875
She tried to take poison
for the shame of it...

50:13.977 --> 50:16.002
and they stopped her just in time.

50:16.113 --> 50:18.343
Were they little green men, or what?

50:20.784 --> 50:24.276
"I can't describe it,"she said. "it's hell."

50:24.388 --> 50:26.686
Somebody down in south America...

50:26.790 --> 50:29.918
did an imitation of that broadcast...

50:30.027 --> 50:31.619
and he ended up in prison.

50:31.728 --> 50:35.129
So I shouldn't complain, I guess.

50:35.232 --> 50:37.200
I didn't go to jail.

50:38.668 --> 50:40.568
I went to Hollywood.

50:40.670 --> 50:43.935
And to testify to yet another coincidence,
here's a leading film director.

50:44.041 --> 50:48.978
All those years ago, he went west with the rest
of us to make our first movie. Richard Wilson.

50:49.079 --> 50:51.104
Our first movie?

50:51.214 --> 50:55.173
Well, among the first of our projects
was to be a story...

50:55.285 --> 50:58.482
based on the fictionalized life
of a certain famous tycoon.

50:58.588 --> 51:01.182
Joe Cotten was to
have played the part.

51:01.291 --> 51:05.057
That certain famous tycoon, yes.
But when the character was changed...

51:05.162 --> 51:07.722
to the famous newspaper tycoon,
it became obvious...

51:07.831 --> 51:10.356
that Orson should play the part,
which, of course, he did.

51:10.467 --> 51:12.162
Oh, I'm not complaining.

51:12.269 --> 51:15.295
No. I had a fine part in citizen Kane.

51:15.405 --> 51:18.340
But I was just wondering.

51:18.442 --> 51:21.639
That original concept
may have been fun.

51:23.013 --> 51:24.913
Yes, I was just wondering...

51:25.015 --> 51:28.143
if I would have been the first or the last...

51:28.251 --> 51:30.276
to impersonate...

51:30.387 --> 51:32.287
Howard Hughes.

51:33.990 --> 51:36.891
#[Fanfare]

51:42.032 --> 51:45.195
[Announcer]
This week, as it must to all aviation's pioneers...

51:45.302 --> 51:47.668
the great heart
of a welcoming nation went out...

51:47.771 --> 51:51.298
to handsome, well-heeled hero, Howard Hughes.

51:51.408 --> 51:55.208
Broken for speed are all records
for round-the-world solo flights.

51:55.312 --> 51:59.772
Broken, too, is the garbage man's record
for sheer tonnage in ticker tape.

51:59.883 --> 52:03.512
Well noted by observers is
the appropriate nature of ticker tape...

52:03.620 --> 52:06.612
as a tribute to the high-flying
Mr. Moneybags himself.

52:06.723 --> 52:08.623
[Wilson]
Why did we change our minds?

52:08.725 --> 52:12.161
Change tycoons?
Of course, we'd have to change his name.

52:12.262 --> 52:15.288
And as a character in fiction...

52:15.398 --> 52:18.856
who could believe that a man
like Howard Hughes could exist?

52:18.969 --> 52:23.133
I put the sweat of my life into this thing.
I have my reputation rolled up in it.

52:24.474 --> 52:27.875
[Announcer] Hughes fighting here
for the future of a controversial airplane...

52:27.978 --> 52:31.607
an all-wood behemoth, the spruce goose.

52:31.715 --> 52:33.808
Other inventions had more success.

52:33.917 --> 52:35.817
One example, the brassiere.

52:35.919 --> 52:38.080
Hughes's design for
a Hughes-directed hit movie...

52:38.188 --> 52:40.088
was, for mammary America...

52:40.190 --> 52:42.681
the cause of a great uplift.

52:42.792 --> 52:45.158
- Less uplifting was the spruce goose...
- [engine whirring, sputtering]

52:46.096 --> 52:48.826
The biggest thing with wings
that ever happened-

52:49.699 --> 52:53.692
- [engine sputters, stops]
- In fact, it flew for a few minutes only,
a few feet in the air.

52:53.803 --> 52:56.397
And I have stated several times
that if it's a failure...

52:56.506 --> 52:59.737
I'll probably leave this country
and never come back, and I mean it.

52:59.843 --> 53:02.835
[Welles]
And that's what he did, finally.

53:02.946 --> 53:05.676
The supersecretive celebrity...

53:05.782 --> 53:08.751
went all out for world fame...

53:08.852 --> 53:13.482
won it, and then got to be
more famous trying for privacy.

53:16.193 --> 53:19.026
Maybe he's a loser after all.

53:19.129 --> 53:22.360
A lady from his past once told me
that's part of his charm.

53:23.800 --> 53:26.769
But this lady-killing, wheeling, dealing...

53:26.870 --> 53:30.738
death-defying, life-defying
mystery man supreme...

53:30.840 --> 53:34.276
has a strange habit of winning somehow-

53:34.377 --> 53:37.608
sometimes anyway-
just at the end.

53:37.714 --> 53:41.548
Is he winning now,
at the end of this story?

53:41.651 --> 53:43.983
[Man on phone]
I only wish I was still in the movie business.

53:44.087 --> 53:48.114
[Welles] our semimythological
night bird of a billionaire...

53:48.225 --> 53:50.887
has flown his Vegas coop.

53:50.994 --> 53:53.588
But only to go on mutely roosting...

53:53.697 --> 53:58.100
on the top of various other holiday hotels...

53:58.201 --> 54:00.192
in germfree...

54:00.303 --> 54:03.238
air-conditioned solitude.

54:04.541 --> 54:07.203
Ah, it's his decision.

54:07.310 --> 54:09.107
On this planet...

54:09.212 --> 54:12.306
crowded and computerized...

54:12.415 --> 54:15.248
being yourself-
whatever that may be -

54:15.352 --> 54:18.446
and keeping yourself to yourself isn't easy.

54:18.555 --> 54:22.218
Make what you want of Howard Hughes,
but not a movie.

54:22.325 --> 54:24.793
Cliff Irving had
more courage than we did...

54:24.894 --> 54:29.092
and as sure a hand,
certainly, at fiction.

54:29.199 --> 54:33.898
Also, I'll admit that he's nudging
the martians a bit...

54:34.004 --> 54:36.165
for the championship title.

54:36.273 --> 54:40.607
[Man on phone] it taxes your imagination
to believe that a thing like this could happen.

54:40.710 --> 54:44.441
[Welles]
"I do not know Clifford Irving,"said the voice.

54:44.547 --> 54:49.382
[Man] until a matter of days ago,
when this thing first came to my attention.

54:50.620 --> 54:54.317
[Welles] all over the world, people were saying
that the fishiest thing in this whole business...

54:54.424 --> 54:56.392
was not Irving's part in it...

54:56.493 --> 55:01.226
but the identity of whoever it was
who claimed to Irving he was Hughes.

55:01.331 --> 55:03.822
And who do you think
is still mixed up in all this?

55:03.933 --> 55:09.030
According to one theory, who else but Elmyr,
a man so skilled in art forgery...

55:09.139 --> 55:10.629
could have forged that manuscript?

55:10.740 --> 55:13.265
Irving's lawyer is speculating
about a host of theories.

55:13.376 --> 55:15.901
Theories, if, for instance,
that telephone voice...

55:16.012 --> 55:18.845
was Hughes and was telling the truth,
we should remember...

55:18.948 --> 55:23.885
that Hughes had been known
to make use of doubles.

55:23.987 --> 55:25.887
And here comes another theory:

55:25.989 --> 55:29.720
Now a double might be
making use of Hughes.

55:29.826 --> 55:33.728
According to informed sources,
high officials in the Hughes empire...

55:33.830 --> 55:38.164
are not even now fully satisfied
that the mystery is completely unraveled.

55:38.268 --> 55:42.364
They are searching for
a "Mr. Big" behind it all.

55:42.472 --> 55:45.839
[Welles]
Was "Mr. Big" Mrs. Big?

55:45.942 --> 55:48.570
- Edith, maybe?
- [Clock cuckoos]

55:48.678 --> 55:51.704
Cliff Irving topped all this
and stopped it dead...

55:51.815 --> 55:53.715
with a confession.

55:53.817 --> 55:57.116
[Man] charges could result
in as much as 100 years imprisonment.

55:57.220 --> 55:59.279
But this may be softened
if Clifford Irving...

55:59.389 --> 56:02.790
agrees to come clean on the whole story.

56:02.892 --> 56:05.087
[Welles]
He did. He told it all...

56:05.195 --> 56:07.026
not only to the courts, but in a book.

56:07.130 --> 56:10.258
And now, as Elmyr leaves that story...

56:10.367 --> 56:12.961
and a chapter in ours
comes to a close...

56:13.069 --> 56:14.969
things may well
be looking up just a bit...

56:15.071 --> 56:18.165
for his biographer, jail or not.

56:18.274 --> 56:21.038
This is a headline
in London's Sunday times:

56:21.144 --> 56:24.307
"Hoaxer Irving makes a handsome profit."

56:24.414 --> 56:28.680
- No, no, no.
- And for Elmyr, at least and at last...

56:28.785 --> 56:32.084
that story has a happy ending:
He's in the clear.

56:32.188 --> 56:33.678
[Phone ringing]

56:33.790 --> 56:35.781
[Welles] here's another coincidence for you.

56:35.892 --> 56:38.053
To Connecticut, yeah.

56:38.161 --> 56:41.324
[Welles] somebody else from Ibiza.
This is our coproducer.

56:41.431 --> 56:44.127
- [Woman on phone] who's calling?
- Richard Drewett.

56:44.234 --> 56:48.432
Richard Drewett, the only simon-pure
noncharlatan in this movie.

56:48.538 --> 56:51.974
Irving just now is holed up in Connecticut,
and we're calling him from Paris.

56:52.075 --> 56:56.273
And so excruciating is Richard's honesty,
that he's insisted on warning...

56:56.379 --> 56:58.870
time magazine's nomination
for con man of the year...

56:58.982 --> 57:01.007
that our call to him is being taped.

57:01.117 --> 57:03.017
- Hello?
- The book.

57:03.119 --> 57:05.144
Can you say anything
about the, um -

57:05.255 --> 57:07.155
the deal that you've managed
to do with the book?

57:07.257 --> 57:11.159
I mean, is it- h-has it turned out
as well as you'd expected?

57:13.096 --> 57:15.394
- [Irving] th-the deal?
- [Drewett] are you going to tell the whole truth?

57:15.498 --> 57:17.523
Yes. Absolutely.

57:17.634 --> 57:21.161
- Yeah.
- In fact the title is the book about the book.

57:21.271 --> 57:24.638
In two years, cliff, you are going to write
"the book about the book about the book."

57:24.741 --> 57:28.404
[Welles] gentlemen, was that
the real voice of Clifford Irving?

57:28.912 --> 57:31.676
Well, Irving's real voice as a writer...

57:31.781 --> 57:34.011
he may well have found now
in his new book.

57:34.117 --> 57:36.017
The new title is what really happened.

57:36.085 --> 57:38.144
[Elmyr]
I want to paint my own paintings.

57:38.288 --> 57:40.654
I want the right uniquely...

57:40.757 --> 57:44.557
and exclusively of my work.

57:44.661 --> 57:48.563
[Welles] and Elmyr?
Will there ever be another book about him?

57:48.665 --> 57:50.963
He's told so many stories about himself...

57:51.067 --> 57:56.004
- always telling this story
to that one and another story to that one.
- Uh, I don't -

57:56.105 --> 57:58.471
he's lived always on the run.

57:58.575 --> 58:04.036
[Elmyr] I, uh, stayed ultimately
12 years in the united states.

58:04.147 --> 58:07.412
Which he spent there illegally,
since he only had a three-month visa.

58:07.517 --> 58:11.578
[Elmyr] I lived very simply.
I lived, uh, on my own paintings.

58:11.688 --> 58:14.486
I sold them for $ 10, $ 15.

58:14.591 --> 58:18.584
My own canvases. And then sometimes
when I had absolutely no money...

58:18.695 --> 58:22.096
I was completely broke,
I made a Modigliani drawing.

58:22.198 --> 58:26.100
I took 'em to one of the big dealers
around Beverly hills.

58:26.202 --> 58:28.568
It never happened
that I didn't sell them.

58:28.671 --> 58:30.571
I always sold them.

58:30.673 --> 58:33.198
One reason he was able to get away
with what he was doing...

58:33.309 --> 58:37.040
for- for 22 years,
selling fakes all over the world...

58:37.146 --> 58:39.046
all over the united states...

58:39.148 --> 58:41.616
was the existence of something new
in the art world.

58:41.718 --> 58:44.380
And that was the art market.

58:44.487 --> 58:47.047
It enabled him to live from day to day...

58:47.156 --> 58:49.681
from painting to painting,
from fake to fake...

58:49.792 --> 58:54.092
from- from con man to con man,
from crook to crook...

58:54.197 --> 58:56.097
and from town to town.

58:56.199 --> 58:58.531
Who knows? What is it?
What -what makes you travel?

58:58.635 --> 59:01.069
You want a change of landscape.
You want to meet new people.

59:01.170 --> 59:02.797
You want to meet new faces.

59:02.906 --> 59:07.809
You think you'll meet somebody more attractive
in the next town as you met there.

59:07.911 --> 59:10.209
You never know. Why?
Why people travel. Do you know?

59:10.313 --> 59:14.079
Because the FBI And the police
in four different states were on his tail.

59:14.183 --> 59:17.277
- But, uh -
- and he had to be one jump ahead of them.

59:17.387 --> 59:21.414
He had to whip off to Mexico and then
up to Canada, and then back to new york.

59:21.524 --> 59:24.721
And then when he heard that the police
were knocking on his door in Miami beach...

59:24.827 --> 59:27.819
he had to scuttle out of town
on a greyhound bus to Texas.

59:27.931 --> 59:31.423
[Man on radio] hit hard by torborg,
but right to third baseman, aurelio rodriguez.

59:31.534 --> 59:33.764
After one hop,
the ball really flattened out for him.

59:33.870 --> 59:37.101
[Welles]
Then, finally, on a distant island...

59:37.206 --> 59:39.106
he did find a home.

59:40.910 --> 59:44.346
He doesn't own it, remember,
but it's a splendid villa...

59:44.447 --> 59:46.972
with a fine view of the village...

59:47.083 --> 59:48.983
and the village jail.

59:49.085 --> 59:51.576
To be in jail here is probably, I would say-

59:51.688 --> 59:53.588
here is better than somewhere else.

59:53.690 --> 59:57.990
- But a jail is a jail. Let's face it.
- [Welles] moment of truth.

59:58.094 --> 01:00:01.325
He's talking about the time
they took him down...

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:05.128
out of that villa, which he doesn't own,
and put him into prison.

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:08.694
Let me show you that again.

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:12.172
To be in jail here is probably, I would say-

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:14.175
here is better than somewhere else.

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:17.474
But a jail is a jail. Let's face it.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:21.380
Hemingway wrote a great short story...

01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:27.047
about an old bullfighter
called "the undefeated."

01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:31.618
Well, all the heroes aren't in the bullring.

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:34.720
Here's our hero, our ex-jailbird...

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:36.992
flying high above his troubles.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.000
Watch the quick recovery.

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:41.832
[Elmyr]
That was quite a disgusting person.

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:45.873
He looks disgusting too, doesn't he?

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:49.911
He was, again, a German...

01:00:50.013 --> 01:00:52.982
whose main preoccupation
was his mustache.

01:00:53.082 --> 01:00:56.074
He kept doing nothing
but touching his mustache.

01:00:56.185 --> 01:01:00.212
He just kept on curling and curling
and curling his mustache.

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:05.258
These other drawings are made
during the time I was in prison.

01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:09.855
In the very end,
the judge himself thanked me...

01:01:09.966 --> 01:01:14.266
and he declared that
I'm a very generous and a very kind person.

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:17.635
Now that he's out of prison,
what will he do?

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:22.836
He'll give a party. Another party.

01:01:22.945 --> 01:01:25.038
[Speaking french]

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:38.218
[Man] Elmyr, how do you mean
you were not in prison?

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:41.728
[Elmyr] because I wasn't a prisoner
in the full sense of word.

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:46.359
I was not imprisoned. I was interned.

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:50.428
- [Woman speaking french]
- She's a great friend of mine.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.270
She's a great friend of mine
she was very sweet and kind to me.

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:56.209
When I was in prison,
she came to see me every day.

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:58.780
Most of the days of the week.

01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:03.909
Jean-Pierre Ramon.
I had a Spanish-polish prince...

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:07.319
Charles-touriski bourbon,
who's a cousin germain...

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:11.655
of the next king of Spain,
Juan Carlos, who came every day.

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.661
I had every day coming in Nina.

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:16.254
[Welles]
Nina, that morsel plucked...

01:02:16.365 --> 01:02:19.163
from our name-dropper's
list of prison visitors...

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:21.862
is the baroness van pallandt.

01:02:21.971 --> 01:02:23.905
[Woman]
She was a witness against Irving.

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:27.669
It seems he couldn't have had a secret
rendezvous with Howard Hughes in Mexico...

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:29.745
because he spent every minute
there with the baroness.

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:33.475
She used to be a famous folk singer,
and now she's famous again.

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:38.177
Many other ladies
flitted across the front pages.

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:40.187
No, our cameras
never got close to them.

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:42.689
But Oja Kodar was something else.

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:46.853
- [Man] uh, miss Kodar-
- [woman] the newspapers have been
calling you the Hungarian connection.

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:48.863
[Kodar]
Because of my connection with Irving?

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:51.297
[Welles]
This is from the tape of a recent interview.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.925
- [Woman] there's quite a list.
- [Kodar] indeed.

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:59.269
- If only half of all that is true, I wonder
how he ever got away to his typewriter.
- [Woman] well, miss Kodar.

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:02.105
- [Man] you wouldn't say that forgery's a crime?
- [Woman] and the experts?

01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:06.307
[Kodar] as long as there are fakers,
I guess there'll have to be experts.

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:09.077
But if there weren't any experts...

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:11.676
would there be any fakers?

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:14.348
[Welles]
A friend-another friend-

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:17.051
once showed a Picasso to Picasso...

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.855
who said, no, it was a fake.

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:22.397
The same friend brought him,
from yet another source...

01:03:22.498 --> 01:03:26.025
another would-be Picasso,
and Picasso said that, too, was a fake.

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:28.865
Then yet another from another source.
"Also fake,"said Picasso.

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:31.667
"But, Pablo,"said his friend...

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:33.833
"I watched you paint that with my own eyes."

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:38.903
[Chuckles] said Picasso,
"I can paint false Picassos as well as anybody."

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:44.310
I'm not excusing myself.
I'm not trying to make an excuse.

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:48.015
I'm trying to explain
a psychological situation...

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:50.251
and a human weakness.

01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:52.919
[Irving] he's not in jail today
for basically two reasons.

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:57.489
A court case would bring such
publicity upon the art world...

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.435
that any art dealer who took the stand
would automatically become suspect.

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:04.870
The other reason he's not in jail is because...

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:08.910
the french police have explained to me
that in order to jail him in France...

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:11.377
they would have to have two witnesses...

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.380
who saw him doing the paintings...

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:15.507
who saw him signing the paintings...

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:18.052
as vlamincks or derains or Picassos.

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:20.088
[Elmyr] the signatures were put on...

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:23.124
much later than the paintings were painted.

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:26.855
I never signed any painting anyway.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.464
That's a very important matter.

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:34.761
[Clock ticking]

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:43.039
No, I never signed any of them.

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:48.380
No. Never did. No.

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:50.782
Never did.

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:08.435
Of course they were signed.

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:14.270
[Welles]
Well, whoever did sign them...

01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:17.107
his paintings are in
so many great collections...

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:19.113
that surely it must be said of Elmyr...

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:22.184
that he has achieved
a certain immortality...

01:05:23.819 --> 01:05:27.778
under various other signatures.

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:33.860
If you-you hang them in a museum
or your collection of great paintings...

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:36.989
and if they hang long enough there,
they become real.

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:42.302
[Welles]
Now, this has been standing here for centuries.

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:45.772
The premiere work of man, perhaps,
in the whole western world.

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:49.333
And it's without a signature.

01:05:50.379 --> 01:05:52.279
Chartres.

01:05:57.053 --> 01:06:02.047
A celebration to god's glory
and to the dignity of man.

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:08.094
Well, all that's left,
most artists seem to feel these days...

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:10.597
is man.

01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:14.802
Naked.

01:06:14.904 --> 01:06:18.533
Poor, forked radish.

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:23.036
There aren't any celebrations.

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:27.004
Ours, the scientists keep telling us...

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:30.415
is a universe which is disposable.

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:38.121
You know, it might be
just this one anonymous glory...

01:06:38.227 --> 01:06:40.320
of all things-

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:42.829
this rich stone forest...

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:45.833
this epic chant, this gaiety...

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:50.565
this grand choiring shout of affirmation...

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:52.834
which we choose...

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:55.433
when all our cities are dust...

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:57.569
to stand intact...

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.910
to mark where we have been...

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:04.710
to testify to what we had it in us...

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.015
to accomplish.

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:13.923
Our works in stone, in paint,
in print are spared-

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:17.727
some of them for a few decades,
or a millennium or two-

01:07:17.833 --> 01:07:21.462
but everything must finally fall in war...

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:26.337
or wear away into
the ultimate and universal ash.

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:29.206
The triumphs and the frauds...

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:31.472
the treasures and the fakes.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:34.413
A fact of life.

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.644
We're going to die.

01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:38.777
"Be of good heart"...

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:44.224
cry the dead artists out of the living past.

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:46.658
"Our songs...

01:07:46.762 --> 01:07:49.788
"will all be silenced.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:51.799
"But what of it?

01:07:54.503 --> 01:07:56.835
Go on singing."

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:01.874
Maybe a man's name...

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.812
doesn't matter...

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.175
all that much.

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:16.381
[Welles]
And now, at last, we come to Oja.

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:19.188
[Woman on p.a. Speaking french]

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:24.165
[Welles] for this true story,
and with her kind collaboration...

01:08:24.265 --> 01:08:28.134
we offer now- well, you might call it
a reenactment of recent history.

01:08:28.804 --> 01:08:32.103
As we told you at the start,
she comes into this only at the end.

01:08:32.207 --> 01:08:34.506
And that's where we've left her,
for the end.

01:08:38.647 --> 01:08:40.774
And as for coincidence-

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:44.444
[scoffs]just for instance,
I give you Oja's grandfather.

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:47.147
Oh, no.
[Chuckles]

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:50.247
No, let's take him back
for a while and save him for later.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:53.328
The mixture's rich enough as it is.

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:55.453
Oja, as far as I know...

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:58.624
never breathed a word
about him to any of us.

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:01.965
She comes into this
when she herself came to the attention of-

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:07.839
well, who else, but the first genius
among all the artists of our age.

01:09:07.943 --> 01:09:10.571
The most celebrated,
certainly the wealthiest painter...

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.977
in 6,000 years.

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:19.352
Well, Picasso is the biggest phenomenon
of our time.

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:24.825
It never existed that a painter was able...

01:09:24.926 --> 01:09:28.624
with one movement of his hand -

01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:33.566
what necessarily didn't involve
more than 10 seconds -

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:35.966
that movement of the hand...

01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:39.165
transformed in gold.

01:09:39.274 --> 01:09:43.211
Not even john d. Rockefeller
was able to do that.

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:46.770
- [Bells chiming]
- [Woman on p.a. Speaking french]

01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:49.214
[Chuckling]
His estate has been valued at...

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:53.220
$ 750 million.

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:58.015
[Chuckles]
Oja turned him into a girl watcher.

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:01.821
This happened not so very long ago...

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:03.796
when Picasso, for reasons of his own...

01:10:03.899 --> 01:10:07.630
went to paint for a while
in the little village of toussaint.

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:12.462
Oja was there too, on her holidays.

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:17.103
And she had a friend with her,
a boy named Olaf...

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:19.443
from somewhere
in the Viking country.

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:22.108
## [Jazz]

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.482
In his homeland,
up there in the frozen north...

01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:26.748
Olaf had been infected rather imperfectly...

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:29.619
with a taste for
the classic jazz of new Orleans...

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:33.855
and his researches in this area
took place under Picasso's window...

01:10:33.963 --> 01:10:38.263
where morning and night
he practiced the trombone.

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:41.268
#[Continues]

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:45.270
Olaf's trombone commenced early...

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:49.336
finished late...

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:51.777
and nearly drove Picasso
out of his skull.

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:57.682
And then - then there was
another distraction.

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:00.888
Far more disturbing.

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:05.492
Oja.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:11.066
Oja in the morning,
on her way to the beach.

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:15.602
Oja at 10:00,
coming back for the suntan lotion.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:21.266
To the beach again...

01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:25.336
and back once more
at noon for lunch.

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:32.982
In that climate,
after lunch one takes a siesta.

01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:35.852
Not Oja.
And not Picasso either.

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:40.524
Cocktail time.

01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:42.324
Dinnertime.

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:44.524
Anytime.

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:49.531
Oja on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday...

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:51.868
and all through the week.

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.841
Week after week.

01:11:56.612 --> 01:11:59.308
Oja checking on the trombone.

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:01.713
Oja escaping from it.

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:04.445
But no escaping for Picasso.

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.586
Was he tempted?

01:12:50.332 --> 01:12:53.631
Perhaps he was... inspired.

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:55.704
[Wings flapping]

01:12:57.339 --> 01:12:59.239
[High heels tapping]

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:16.679
[Trombone blows]

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:29.029
I can't tell you
what happened in there.

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:32.999
But Picasso was a fast worker,
by which -

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:35.160
I mean to say, you understand, that...

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:38.239
the results of this encounter
were, to say the least of it...

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.138
extremely fruitful.

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:07.561
Figs sweetened on the trees.

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:12.106
Grapes burst into ripeness
on the vines.

01:15:13.141 --> 01:15:15.837
And 22-22-

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:19.072
large portraits of miss Oja Kodar...

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:22.275
were born under that virile brush.

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:28.946
Money. We've heard Elmyr on that subject.

01:15:29.057 --> 01:15:31.525
Well, Picasso didn't make all that bread...

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:35.154
by casting any crumbs of it on the waters,
or feeding it to the birds...

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:38.256
or giving away any pictures to his models.

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:42.030
But Oja laid down conditions.
She put a price...

01:15:42.137 --> 01:15:43.695
on the sunshine.

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:47.536
To give it up, he had to give something to her.
And this is true, you know.

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:50.737
What she exacted from Picasso
was no less than this:

01:15:50.846 --> 01:15:53.974
All those pictures - all 22 of them -

01:15:54.082 --> 01:15:56.550
were to be hers, outright.

01:15:56.652 --> 01:16:00.850
Her property. Oja's very own
to pick up and carry away...

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:02.890
which is just exactly
what she did with them.

01:16:04.626 --> 01:16:08.323
The lot. Let's call it the loot.

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:11.263
She got away with it all.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.828
Well, no wonder she's rich, you'll say.

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:17.238
- But wait, there's more to this.
- [Bells chiming]

01:16:17.339 --> 01:16:21.105
Just now, Paris is fogbound.

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:24.337
Just then -
and this is important to our story-

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:26.914
there was another sort of paralysis.

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:29.745
Uh, Paris was suffering from august.

01:16:29.851 --> 01:16:31.751
[Chuckles]
This happens every year.

01:16:31.853 --> 01:16:34.344
It shuts down, closes up...

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:38.392
and this is the time when an invader
could take the country by telephone...

01:16:38.493 --> 01:16:40.961
if he could get somebody to answer it.

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:44.590
And this is the time, of all time...

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:47.897
when, down there in toussaint...

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:51.769
Picasso, opening his morning newspaper...

01:16:51.873 --> 01:16:54.239
read that in a little-known art gallery in Paris...

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:56.811
there had been opened
to the public an exposition...

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:59.278
of the works of Pablo Picasso.!

01:16:59.381 --> 01:17:03.681
- [Thunderclap]
- At this, a species of atomic blast...

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:06.310
stormed out of the riviera.!

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:09.981
In the American hemisphere...

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:12.788
we give our bigger tornadoes...

01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:17.228
names like Ethel, Mary Lou and Dolores.

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:20.460
Well, what shook
the south of France that day...

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:23.163
should've been called "Pablo."

01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:25.831
Booking a seat
on the first available plane...

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:28.535
the storm now moved toward Paris.

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:31.135
And there wasn't any improvement
in the atmospheric conditions...

01:17:31.246 --> 01:17:35.842
at the airport when another newspaper
came to the artist's furious attention.

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:37.919
"Picasso,"said the headline...

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.954
"has been born again."

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:45.118
Critics were hailing the freshness,
the force, the fecundity.

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:47.593
But who cared? Not Picasso.

01:17:47.696 --> 01:17:51.097
No. There'd been
a very clear understanding.

01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:55.158
None of those portraits
were ever to be sold.

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:59.400
Oja'd get rich,
but not a penny's profit for Pablo.

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:05.071
There are witnesses who swear
that an aureole of blue flame...

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.648
sizzled about that noble head...

01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:11.014
as the great painter
burst into the picture gallery.

01:18:12.054 --> 01:18:15.751
What is remembered -
what will never be forgotten -

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:19.918
is the terrible incandescence...

01:18:20.028 --> 01:18:22.428
of Picasso's rage.

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:25.989
And then there came a sudden...

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:28.797
and quite remarkable change.

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:32.738
Those famous staring eyes...

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:36.971
now stared as eyes
have never stared before.

01:18:43.351 --> 01:18:48.448
From picture to picture they traveled.

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:53.583
All 22 of them...

01:18:53.695 --> 01:18:55.788
recognizing...

01:18:55.897 --> 01:18:57.922
none.

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:05.200
Not one single canvas...

01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:07.832
in that whole collection...

01:19:10.479 --> 01:19:13.471
had been painted by Picasso.

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:18.744
And there she was...

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:21.584
standing beside him.

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:24.284
You told him about your...

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:28.152
grandfather...

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:30.163
that he was dying.

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:34.095
- He didn't even know he existed.
- Nobody did.

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:36.102
The greatest of all the art forgers...

01:19:36.204 --> 01:19:39.799
remained always a legend,
mentioned only in whispers.

01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:42.536
Oja, tell us what you did with Picasso.

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:44.942
I just took him by the hand
and led him out...

01:19:45.046 --> 01:19:46.946
and put him in my little car.

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:50.609
And drove him to your
grandfather's secret studio?

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.788
This is true, you know.
What's amazing is that he went with her.

01:19:55.891 --> 01:19:57.916
Here are some pictures.
These are the last I took of him.

01:19:58.026 --> 01:19:59.618
And the first to be made public, hmm?

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:02.891
[Oja] he was never photographed,
except in the family.

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:05.865
- He was very careful about that.
- [Welles] that's why he was never caught.

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:09.528
You know, I never thought to ask Elmyr about him.
After all, they're both Hungarians.

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:13.233
There are many great painters in the renaissance,
but only one da vinci.

01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:15.241
The point being,
that among great art forgers...

01:20:15.343 --> 01:20:17.311
your grandfather is the da vinci?

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:20.074
One of his da vinci's is so famous
I don't dare to name it.

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:23.640
Giving him credit is as tough
as nailing him for the crime.

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:25.811
- Crime?
- [Chuckling] well...

01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:27.889
he painted every last one
of those phony Picassos of you.

01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:32.050
For every last one of which
Picasso was very highly praised.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.926
But not, to put it mildly, highly pleased. You
must have known you couldn't get away with it.

01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:38.022
I got to meet Picasso.

01:20:38.133 --> 01:20:42.502
So, here they are,
the world's best and least known geniuses.

01:20:42.604 --> 01:20:45.767
My grandfather was very glad to see him.

01:20:45.874 --> 01:20:47.739
[Welles sighs]
"Picasso"...

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:49.834
said her grandfather...

01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:52.709
"I've been painting you for years.

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:57.281
All the great Picasso periods."

01:20:57.385 --> 01:21:00.183
I'm not trying too hard
for the Hungarian accent...

01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:02.620
- but I think that's how it went.
- Oh, yes.

01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:07.286
"This girl," said Picasso,
"claims that you're dying."

01:21:07.395 --> 01:21:10.262
"A dying art forger," he said,
"is still an art forger."

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:12.765
Well, you tell us what Picasso said.

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:14.802
He called us both a couple of crooks.

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:17.428
"Oja,"said your grandfather,
"is quite as honest...

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:20.872
"as anyone that young, that beautiful...

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:23.274
and that Hungarian has any need to be."

01:21:23.378 --> 01:21:26.370
"She's stolen my pictures," said Picasso.

01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:28.949
"She made you a gift, señor.
She gave you a whole summer."

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:33.248
"It's not more than the price of 22 Picassos.
And where, for god's sake, are they now?"

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:34.982
"Pablo -

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:37.058
"may I call you Pablo?

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.060
"No.

01:21:42.764 --> 01:21:45.130
"Well, señor...

01:21:45.233 --> 01:21:48.134
"it seems that in
my son-in-law's new little art gallery...

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:51.569
"there are 22 paintings,
every one of which has been acclaimed...

01:21:51.673 --> 01:21:53.937
"as a masterpiece.

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:57.478
At least, that's the best critical opinion."

01:21:57.579 --> 01:22:00.844
"The best critical opinion
is a load of horse manure."

01:22:00.949 --> 01:22:03.679
Or words to that effect.

01:22:03.785 --> 01:22:07.346
"How perfectly we agree on that, señor.

01:22:07.455 --> 01:22:09.946
"But you have
so little reason to be bitter.

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:13.516
"Is there a man in all the world
who doesn't know your name?

01:22:13.628 --> 01:22:15.619
And who in all the world knows mine?"

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:18.255
"You're one of those that use
so many names that you forget your own!"

01:22:18.366 --> 01:22:21.995
"I, señor, am not one...

01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:24.367
"of anything.

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:28.670
"Like you, I am unique.

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:32.213
"You've seen my big Cézanne
at the metropolitan?

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:36.410
"Is that just a forgery, my friend?

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:40.721
Is it not also a painting?"

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:46.121
Now, you tell us
what Picasso had to say to that.

01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:48.388
Something dirty in Spanish, I think.

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:51.192
He did accuse
your grandfather of arrogance.

01:22:51.299 --> 01:22:55.963
Arrogance? A man who never in his life
signed his own name to a picture.

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:57.971
What could be more modest than that?

01:22:58.073 --> 01:23:00.769
"It's true that when you think
of those great Rembrandt" -

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:04.208
- Chicago has five of them. Important ones.
- "And London.

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:09.716
"Why, just those two
small tintorettos in brazil.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:12.582
- "And Tokyo.
- The big one.

01:23:12.687 --> 01:23:17.021
In Cincinnati. Did all the Goyas
and most of the Grecos."

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:20.060
And the Monet.
And the Manet in Detroit.

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:23.221
"So, am I not then myself"...

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:26.892
said your grandfather,
"one of the great painters?

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:29.903
"No? No.

01:23:31.139 --> 01:23:35.508
"Yet here you are, Picasso,
standing at the deathbed of a ghost.

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.737
"For all my life I've been a ghost.

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:42.783
"And for all time, the galleries and museums
will be haunted with my works.

01:23:42.884 --> 01:23:47.048
"Do you think I should confess?
To what?

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:50.420
"Committing masterpieces?

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:55.394
"They'd all be torn down from the walls.
And what then would be left of me?

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:59.593
"But before I die,
I find I need something.

01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:03.197
"To believe -

01:24:05.774 --> 01:24:08.675
"I must believe...

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:11.769
"that art itself...

01:24:13.148 --> 01:24:15.048
"is real.

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:20.116
If it is not, señor" -

01:24:21.856 --> 01:24:24.689
here, my grandfather
was interrupted by Picasso...

01:24:24.793 --> 01:24:27.284
who asked him
to stop making speeches.

01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:29.625
"We've only to settle the fate...

01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:32.291
"of 22 large canvases...

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.300
"painted by me.

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:37.394
"Picasso, you move so easily...

01:24:37.505 --> 01:24:40.372
"from one Picasso period to another...

01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:43.342
"change like a-an actor...

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:46.608
"like an art forger yourself.

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:49.581
"Won't you give to me,
who admire you so much...

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:53.052
"a happy death?

01:24:53.154 --> 01:24:55.315
"Can you not let me go
knowing that at last...

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:59.189
"I've managed to give something new...

01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:01.194
"to the world?

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:05.290
"One whole Picasso period.

01:25:07.969 --> 01:25:09.869
Would you give me this?"

01:25:09.971 --> 01:25:13.202
"Give me my pictures," said Picasso.

01:25:13.308 --> 01:25:15.868
"Give me back my 22 paintings."

01:25:15.977 --> 01:25:19.413
"Ah,"said your grandfather.
"That is impossible.

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:24.117
I have burnt them."

01:25:25.753 --> 01:25:29.189
- [Elmyr] well, good-bye, Picasso.
- [Bells chiming]

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:31.189
Time for a confession?

01:25:32.827 --> 01:25:34.795
- Time to go.
- Good night, Oja.

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:38.698
That's her real name, you know.

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:42.095
Oja. Oja Kodar.

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:46.037
I don't think that young gentleman's
a trombone player...

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:49.042
but Oja's grandfather was Hungarian.

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:52.705
- Did he paint any pictures?
- Never in his life.

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:57.012
[Welles] ladies and gentlemen,
we did use Oja's grandfather...

01:25:57.118 --> 01:26:00.485
to lend verisimilitude to
the reenactment of this story.

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:03.648
But is "reenactment" really the word?

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:06.591
What I mean is,
with a story this hard to believe...

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:09.959
reenactment isn't easy.
[Chuckling]

01:26:10.064 --> 01:26:12.328
- Right, François?
- Right.

01:26:12.433 --> 01:26:15.834
At the very beginning, I - of all this -
I did make you a promise.

01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:18.804
Remember? I did promise...

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:22.536
that for one hour
I'd tell you only the truth.

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:29.743
That hour, ladies and gentlemen, is over.

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:33.719
For the past 17 minutes,
I've been lying my head off.

01:26:35.056 --> 01:26:38.514
[Welles] the truth-
and please forgive us for it-

01:26:38.626 --> 01:26:41.959
is that we've been forging an art story.

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:46.693
As a charlatan, of course,
my job was to try to make it real...

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:50.532
not that reality
has anything to do with it.

01:26:50.638 --> 01:26:53.971
Reality? It's the toothbrush...

01:26:54.075 --> 01:26:57.101
waiting at home for you in its glass.

01:26:57.212 --> 01:27:01.114
A bus ticket, a paycheck...

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:03.275
and the grave.

01:27:03.384 --> 01:27:06.945
In the right mood, perhaps,
Elmyr has just as few regrets...

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:08.955
as I have to have been a charlatan.

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:11.582
But we're not so proud, either of us...

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:13.820
as to lay any superior claim...

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:16.761
to being very much worse
than the rest of you.

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:25.964
No, what we professional liars
hope to serve is truth.

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:28.440
I'm afraid the pompous word
for that is "art."

01:27:28.543 --> 01:27:31.239
Picasso himself said it.

01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:33.906
"Art, "he said, "is a lie-

01:27:35.016 --> 01:27:37.484
"a lie that makes us...

01:27:37.585 --> 01:27:39.485
realize the truth."

01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:44.749
Oja's grandfather,
floating here in the air...

01:27:44.859 --> 01:27:46.656
has no comment, which isn't surprising...

01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:49.662
because he never existed.

01:27:49.764 --> 01:27:52.597
To the memory of that great man
who will never cease to exist...

01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:56.693
I offer my apologies...

01:27:56.804 --> 01:27:58.704
and wish you all...

01:27:58.806 --> 01:28:02.298
true and false...

01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:05.402
a very pleasant good evening.

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:36.937
