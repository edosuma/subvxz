buildings down,

they hunt for
anything left behind.

Look at that.

- Good deal.

- 100 bucks for all 4.

knock 'er down-er.

outside the city,

01:47.233 --> 01:49.133

taking down a wall 'cause

no big deal.

going from their houses.

01:55.834 --> 01:57.567
Obviously, you can't
take a risk there.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.133
This house is gonna be
a real test for him.

01:59.266 --> 02:01.934
It's a stepping stone in
his learning, for sure.

Just you and I on this one and,
Ted'll come down and

good salvage there.

Central chimneys kept rooms
comfortable during

The hotel was built
inside a ring of condos,

20:02.734 --> 20:05.767

swing it over the
top of the building,

20:07.900 --> 20:10.967

- Yeah, this could be perfect.

25:39.367 --> 25:40.166
Alright.

25:40.300 --> 25:41.233

No, I'm gonna keep
this treasure for myself.

sell that box.

and 1 buck for all the jewelry.

looking up that microscope.

26:19.700 --> 26:23.533
It's kinda cool.
It's an Austrian company, 1926.

26:23.667 --> 26:26.567
C. Reichert. But,
guess what the value is?

26:26.700 --> 26:30.600
- 6, 700 bucks.
- Well, they go from 3 to 1000.

26:30.734 --> 26:33.200
3 is rough though, right?
Like, 3 is hammered, right?

26:33.333 --> 26:35.667
- Yeah. Poor condition.
- 1000 is mint.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.333
- 1000's mint.
- I think we're 7, 750?

26:38.467 --> 26:39.667
- Sort of that range?
- Yeah.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.300
We can ask 800 bucks.
Look, if we get 500...

26:42.433 --> 26:43.867
- ...I'll be happy.
- I agree.

- Cool, eh?
- All salvage stuff.

43:19.834 --> 43:21.800
- Wow!
- Look at the salvage.

43:21.934 --> 43:23.734
- Bowlerama.
- That was right on the bar.

43:23.867 --> 43:27.000
That was above the bar
in Bowlerama, the snack bar.

43:27.133 --> 43:29.467
Those lights, these lights,
they're all from

43:29.600 --> 43:32.667
the Simpson's building.
This is all salvage.

43:32.800 --> 43:35.533
- This is what happens, man.
- Hey, did you see the amps?

43:35.667 --> 43:37.500
- Yeah, see?
- (laughs)

43:37.633 --> 43:40.133
All of those amps are from
the market village mall.

43:40.266 --> 43:42.934
This is a perfect example
of taking crap out a

43:43.066 --> 43:46.000
dirty old building, you put it
in a nice environment,

43:46.133 --> 43:47.967
and look at it.
Look at the place.

43:48.100 --> 43:49.900
It's beautiful.
Wicked cool.

43:50.033 --> 43:52.133
Yeah, I kind of see some beer
around here, so like...

43:52.266 --> 43:53.867
(bell rings)
You, you owe me a beer.

43:54.000 --> 43:54.967
How do I owe you a beer?

43:55.100 --> 43:55.867
How would I ever
owe you a beer?

43:56.000 --> 43:56.900
It sounds right.

43:57.033 --> 43:58.467
No, I think
you owe me a beer.

43:58.600 --> 44:00.700
We'll come back in
a couple of weeks.

44:00.834 --> 44:02.433
Whatever.

44:02.567 --> 44:04.133
(door bell chimes)

44:04.266 --> 44:14.233
