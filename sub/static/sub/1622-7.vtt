(CAWING)

02:10.520 --> 02:11.570
YGRITTE: How far are we?

02:12.280 --> 02:13.530
About a week, I think.

02:13.650 --> 02:14.950
You think?

02:15.400 --> 02:16.530
You don't know?

02:16.610 --> 02:20.240
JON: When we went to Castle Black, we took
the King's Road.

02:20.330 --> 02:22.950
(SCOFFS) You and your roads.

02:23.450 --> 02:25.380
Is that how you lot do your fighting?

02:25.460 --> 02:28.800
You march down the road
banging drums and waving banners?

02:28.880 --> 02:30.590
Most of the time, yes.

02:31.630 --> 02:33.850
How do the men holding the banners fight?

02:34.670 --> 02:36.050
They don't, really.

02:36.930 --> 02:39.300
It's a great honor to
carry your house sigil.

02:40.470 --> 02:43.440
And the drummers...
Is that a great honor, too?

02:43.970 --> 02:46.440
Usually it's the young boys
banging the drums.

02:46.730 --> 02:48.230
So, what good are they?

02:48.310 --> 02:50.030
They help the men march.

02:50.480 --> 02:51.570
How?

02:51.650 --> 02:53.320
Well, it's...

02:53.820 --> 02:55.070
It's the rhythm.

02:55.150 --> 02:57.450
Oh, you mean right foot, left foot,

02:57.570 --> 02:59.820
right foot, left foot, right foot?

02:59.910 --> 03:02.160
What, you need help remembering that?

03:03.040 --> 03:06.510
When Mance gives the signal
and we hit Castle Black,

03:06.580 --> 03:09.500
we won't be banging
on drums to let them know we're coming.

03:09.790 --> 03:10.960
No.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.140
No, you're just gonna
light the biggest fire

03:15.170 --> 03:17.330
the North has ever seen
to let them know you're coming.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.020
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

03:24.180 --> 03:26.230
ORELL: She's right, you don't.

03:29.140 --> 03:31.520
I know you cut me loose on the Wall.

03:31.690 --> 03:35.360
Cut her loose, too.
Do you see her sulking about it?

03:36.780 --> 03:39.200
That's because
she understands the way things are.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.290
And are you gonna share it with me,

03:44.160 --> 03:47.210
the deep wisdom you found
inside the head of a bird?

03:47.540 --> 03:49.420
People work together when it suits them.

03:49.540 --> 03:51.460
They're loyal when it suits them.

03:51.540 --> 03:53.970
They love each other when it suits them.

03:54.090 --> 03:56.560
And they kill each other
when it suits them.

03:57.090 --> 03:59.010
She knows that, you don't.

03:59.630 --> 04:02.230
Which is why you'll never hold on to her.

04:15.860 --> 04:18.079
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

04:18.149 --> 04:21.000
That rain will cost us another day.

04:22.570 --> 04:25.330
Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.

04:25.410 --> 04:27.580
Lord Walder is prickly by nature. If...

04:27.660 --> 04:29.790
"Prickly"? That what you call it?

04:29.910 --> 04:32.090
Might be the least pleasant
man I've ever met.

04:32.170 --> 04:33.290
Yes, and that is why...

04:33.380 --> 04:37.350
I've seen wet shits
I liked better than Walder Frey.

04:41.090 --> 04:42.680
Apologies, Your Grace.

04:42.760 --> 04:46.180
I've spent too many years
around lancers and pikemen.

04:46.260 --> 04:50.390
I've spent two years nursing wounded
men, watching them bleed and die.

04:51.020 --> 04:52.940
I'm not afraid of wet shits.

04:53.150 --> 04:54.520
(LAUGHING)

04:54.610 --> 04:57.200
Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.

04:57.270 --> 04:58.870
EDMURE: He can take it as he likes.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.950
He's getting the wedding he wanted.

05:01.070 --> 05:02.620
He's getting a wedding.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.160
It was a king he wanted.

05:05.280 --> 05:09.130
Edmure is the best match a Frey has
had in the history of their house.

05:10.290 --> 05:11.460
We should all get some sleep.

if you don't put some clothes on,

06:33.120 --> 06:34.960
I can't promise I won't attack you again.

06:35.290 --> 06:36.960
Attack. Attack.

My mother.

07:04.990 --> 07:06.240
Is that Valyrian?

07:06.860 --> 07:07.910
Gaaa.

07:08.410 --> 07:10.120
"Gaaa"?

"Ritsas."

07:23.300 --> 07:24.510
(LAUGHS)

07:25.050 --> 07:26.390
That was close enough.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.600
Does she know her daughter's a queen?

07:33.010 --> 07:34.310
Not yet.

07:36.310 --> 07:38.860
That will be a surprise, I expect.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.190
Many surprises for her.

07:47.650 --> 07:49.780
How am I supposed to sit
here planning a war

07:49.910 --> 07:52.000
when you're over there, looking like that?

07:56.660 --> 07:58.880
Will you come with me one day to Volantis?

08:00.460 --> 08:02.380
When all this is over?

08:02.460 --> 08:03.800
I will.

08:05.420 --> 08:06.590
I promise.

08:11.430 --> 08:13.390
I know she'd love to meet you.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.310
And her grandchild.

08:21.310 --> 08:22.400
What, now?

08:28.650 --> 08:30.370
Are you certain?

08:32.409 --> 08:34.000
Are you angry with me?

08:34.780 --> 08:36.250
Angry?

08:39.960 --> 08:41.669
You're my queen.

08:45.090 --> 08:48.760
And I have your
little prince or princess inside me.

08:49.510 --> 08:51.130
Maybe one of each.

08:52.300 --> 08:53.970

Can you leave the war for one night?

09:08.690 --> 09:10.240

09:11.950 --> 09:13.490
Do you hear me?

09:41.600 --> 09:44.190
You need to be patient. Give her time.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.150
Your cock shouldn't go near her

09:47.270 --> 09:49.820
till she's slick as a baby seal.

09:50.230 --> 09:54.030
And then you go inside, but slowly.

10:17.470 --> 10:20.390
What did he tell you?
He's gonna make you his lady

10:20.470 --> 10:22.770
and live with you in some castle?

10:22.850 --> 10:26.700
No, he didn't tell me anything.
He barely talks.

10:26.770 --> 10:31.280
I've seen you two whispering in the
night, giggling like a pair of girls.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.200
What, you're jealous?

10:33.280 --> 10:36.870
Of course I'm jealous.
You should be with one of your own.

10:36.950 --> 10:40.750
And you're one of my own? I've never
heard a kind word from your mouth.

10:40.950 --> 10:43.200
You would if you were mine.

10:46.040 --> 10:52.390
I'd tell you that
you're beautiful and fierce and wild.

10:52.460 --> 10:53.960
I'd be good to you.

10:57.010 --> 10:58.480
You love him?

11:05.810 --> 11:08.440
'Cause he's pretty? Is that it?

11:08.560 --> 11:11.190
You like his pretty hair
and his pretty eyes?

11:13.480 --> 11:14.610
You think pretty is gonna make you happy?

11:14.730 --> 11:15.860
Don't touch me.

11:15.940 --> 11:19.290
You won't love him so much
when you find out what he really is.

11:22.660 --> 11:24.160
SANSA: Growing up at Winterfell,

11:24.290 --> 11:25.790
all I ever wanted was to escape,

11:26.660 --> 11:30.170
to come here to the capital.

11:30.830 --> 11:33.260
See the southern knights
and their painted armor

11:33.340 --> 11:35.840
and King's Landing after dark.

11:38.050 --> 11:41.050
All the candles burning
in all those windows.

11:43.510 --> 11:45.440
I'm stupid.

11:46.430 --> 11:50.860
A stupid little girl
with stupid dreams who never learns.

11:50.940 --> 11:52.190
Come on.

11:54.860 --> 11:56.160
Come walk with me.

11:58.570 --> 12:01.490
I remember the first time
I saw you in the throne room.

12:01.570 --> 12:04.580
I'd never seen anyone
who looked so unhappy.

12:04.990 --> 12:09.000
I want very much for you to be happy,
Sansa, and so does my grandmother.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.760
You would have been happy at Highgarden,

12:14.840 --> 12:18.680
but women in our position
must make the best of our circumstances.

12:19.340 --> 12:23.350
How do I make the best
of my circumstances? I have to marry him.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.480
Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?

12:28.560 --> 12:29.560
No.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.440
Has he been kind to you?

12:32.230 --> 12:33.860
He's tried.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.070
You don't want him, though.

12:36.150 --> 12:37.150
He's a Lannister.

12:37.230 --> 12:39.950
Far from the worst Lannister,
wouldn't you say?

12:41.990 --> 12:45.870
I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you...

12:46.490 --> 12:48.250
My son will be king.

12:48.750 --> 12:52.120
Sons learn from their
mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal.

12:53.170 --> 12:55.790
And your son, if I'm not mistaken,

12:56.590 --> 13:01.470
your son might be the Lord of Casterly
Rock and the North someday.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.100
What?

13:06.930 --> 13:08.400
My son...

13:09.100 --> 13:10.520
With him.

13:12.940 --> 13:14.940
I'll have to...

13:15.650 --> 13:17.320
We'll have to...

13:17.400 --> 13:19.200
if it's the pain you're worried about...

13:19.280 --> 13:23.620
I'm not afraid of the
pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.

13:23.820 --> 13:25.120
What is it, then?

13:27.450 --> 13:32.080
He's rather good-looking, even with the scar.
Especially with the scar.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.260
He's a dwarf.

13:34.790 --> 13:36.260
And Loras...

13:37.250 --> 13:38.470
Loras.

13:41.760 --> 13:45.730
Some women like tall men.
Some like short men.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.350
Some like hairy men. Some like bald men.

13:48.430 --> 13:52.810
Gentle men, rough men,
ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls.

13:53.850 --> 13:56.780
Most women don't know
what they like until they've tried it.

13:57.150 --> 14:02.400
And, sadly, so many of us get to try
so little before we're old and gray.

14:04.610 --> 14:08.990
Tyrion may surprise you. From what
I've heard, he's quite experienced.

14:09.990 --> 14:13.210
And that's a good thing?

14:13.290 --> 14:14.590
It can be.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.970
We're very complicated,
you know. Pleasing us takes practice.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.720
How do you know all this?

14:21.710 --> 14:23.390
Did your mother teach you?

14:26.680 --> 14:29.400
Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me.

14:33.180 --> 14:34.780
TYRION: She's a child.

14:34.850 --> 14:36.350
BRONN: She's a foot taller than you.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.030
A tall child.

14:38.650 --> 14:40.400
What's the youngest you've ever had?

14:40.480 --> 14:41.900
Not that young.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.450
How much older?

14:44.860 --> 14:45.990
Older.

14:46.950 --> 14:49.370
You're a lord, she's a lady.

14:49.910 --> 14:52.630
And a beauty, at that. I
don't see the problem.

14:52.700 --> 14:54.800
Shae isn't going to like it.

14:54.870 --> 14:56.670
Shae is a whore.

14:56.750 --> 14:59.550
Are you gonna marry her, eh?

14:59.630 --> 15:02.800
How did marrying
a whore work out for you the first time?

15:02.880 --> 15:05.510
I should never have told you about that.

15:05.590 --> 15:09.020
You want Shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.

15:09.090 --> 15:12.060
All you have to do
is get a son in the Stark girl.

15:12.140 --> 15:13.890
He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day.

15:14.060 --> 15:15.860
You can rule the North in his name.

15:16.310 --> 15:18.980
You'll have two women
and a whole kingdom of your own.

15:19.060 --> 15:23.030
Two women to despise me
and a whole kingdom to join them.

15:24.900 --> 15:28.200
You waste time trying
to get people to love you,

15:28.280 --> 15:30.910
you'll end up
the most popular dead man in town.

15:30.990 --> 15:32.540
(BRONN CHUCKLES)

15:34.870 --> 15:36.670
You want to fuck that Stark girl.

15:36.790 --> 15:38.630
You just don't want to admit it.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.140
I don't pay you to put
evil notions in my head.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.390
The ones already there don't need company.

15:46.460 --> 15:49.310
You pay me to kill people who bother you.

15:51.510 --> 15:53.610
Evil notions come free.

16:18.710 --> 16:20.210
(DOOR CLOSES)

16:26.210 --> 16:27.510
Your Grace.

16:28.210 --> 16:29.680
Grandfather.

16:31.260 --> 16:32.760
You wanted to speak to me?

16:32.840 --> 16:34.390
Yes.

16:34.470 --> 16:38.020
I'd like a report on the
meetings of my Small Council.

16:38.810 --> 16:40.610
You're welcome to attend the meetings

16:40.730 --> 16:42.530
of your Small Council, Your Grace.

16:42.900 --> 16:44.070
Any or all of them.

16:44.150 --> 16:45.900
I've been very busy.

16:45.980 --> 16:48.580
Many important matters
require a king's attention.

16:48.650 --> 16:49.990
Of course.

16:51.780 --> 16:54.280
You've been holding the council meetings

16:54.370 --> 16:58.000
in the Tower of the Hand
instead of the Small Council chamber.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.550
I have, yes.

17:01.210 --> 17:02.750
May I ask why?

17:03.120 --> 17:05.550
Well, the Tower of the
Hand is where I work.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.710
To walk from there to here would take time,

17:08.839 --> 17:11.680
time I could otherwise spend productively.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.060
So if I wanted to attend a council meeting,

17:14.140 --> 17:18.060
I would now have to climb all the
stairs in the Tower of the Hand?

17:33.360 --> 17:36.330
We could arrange to have you carried.

17:39.790 --> 17:44.510
Tell me about the Targaryen girl
in the east and her dragons.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.250
Where did you hear about this?

17:46.540 --> 17:47.710
Is it true?

17:49.170 --> 17:50.640
Apparently so.

17:53.130 --> 17:56.680
Don't you think we ought
to do something about it?

17:58.470 --> 18:02.320
When I was Hand of
the King under your father's predecessor,

18:02.390 --> 18:07.240
the skulls of all the Targaryen
dragons were kept in this room.

18:09.070 --> 18:12.910
The skull of the last
of them was right here.

18:14.110 --> 18:16.110
It was the size of an apple.

18:17.570 --> 18:20.670
And the biggest was the size of a carriage.

18:20.740 --> 18:25.800
Yes, and the creature
to whom it belonged died 300 years ago.

18:26.830 --> 18:30.460
Curiosities on the far side of
the world are no threat to us.

18:30.590 --> 18:34.060
But how do we know
these dragons are just curiosities

18:34.130 --> 18:37.180
and not the beasts
that brought the whole world to heel?

18:37.260 --> 18:40.140
Because we have been told
as much by the many experts

18:40.220 --> 18:42.190
who serve the realm by counseling the King

18:42.310 --> 18:44.310
on matters about which he knows nothing.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.740
But I haven't been counseled.

18:47.190 --> 18:50.240
You are being counseled
at this very moment.

18:52.280 --> 18:55.280
I should be consulted about such things.

18:55.780 --> 18:58.280
From now on, I will see to it that you are

18:58.450 --> 19:00.950
appropriately consulted
on important matters

19:01.910 --> 19:03.540
whenever necessary.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.140
Your Grace.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.810
Yunkai. The Yellow City.

19:32.520 --> 19:37.200

not soldiers. We can defeat them.

19:37.820 --> 19:42.000
On the field, with ease.
But they won't meet us on the field.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.380
They have provisions,
patience, and strong walls.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.960
If they're wise, they'll
hide behind those walls

19:48.080 --> 19:50.580
and chip away at us, man by man.

19:50.670 --> 19:52.210
I don't want half my army killed

19:52.340 --> 19:53.930
before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

19:54.590 --> 19:57.340
We don't need Yunkai, Khaleesi.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.010
Taking this city will not bring you

20:00.130 --> 20:02.310
any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne.

20:05.010 --> 20:07.060
How many slaves are there in Yunkai?

20:08.020 --> 20:10.900
200,000, if not more.

20:11.730 --> 20:15.030
Then we have 200,000
reasons to take the city.

20:16.690 --> 20:18.110

20:18.280 --> 20:21.080

20:21.160 --> 20:25.540
Tell the slavers I will receive them here,
and accept their surrender.

20:25.870 --> 20:30.970
Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer
the same fate as Astapor.

22:52.720 --> 22:57.020

before dragons stirred in old Valyria.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.400
Many an army has broken against our walls.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.280
You shall find
no easy conquest here, Khaleesi.

23:06.780 --> 23:07.870
DAENERYS: Good.

23:08.450 --> 23:11.620
My Unsullied need
practice. I was told to blood them early.

23:11.700 --> 23:15.420
If blood is your desire, blood shall flow.

23:16.710 --> 23:17.800
But why?

23:18.580 --> 23:22.010
'Tis true you have
committed savageries in Astapor,

23:22.090 --> 23:25.510
but the Yunkai
are a forgiving and generous people.

23:29.890 --> 23:33.690
The wise masters of Yunkai have
sent a gift for the Silver Queen.

23:39.600 --> 23:43.030
There is far more than
this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.

23:44.150 --> 23:46.150
- My ship?
- Yes, Khaleesi.

23:46.240 --> 23:49.280
As I said, we are a generous people.

23:49.740 --> 23:51.710
You shall have as many
ships as you require.

23:51.820 --> 23:53.750
And what do you ask in return?

23:53.830 --> 23:58.250
All we ask
is that you make use of these ships.

23:58.330 --> 24:00.880
Sail them back to Westeros
where you belong,

24:01.000 --> 24:03.550
and leave us to conduct
our affairs in peace.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.630
I have a gift for you as well.

24:14.430 --> 24:16.520
But I also want something in return.

24:17.640 --> 24:20.110
You will release every slave in Yunkai.

Every man, woman, and child

24:23.020 --> 24:26.650
shall be given as much food, clothing,

24:26.730 --> 24:28.950
as payment for their years of servitude.

24:29.570 --> 24:33.790
Reject this gift,
and I shall show you no mercy.

24:33.870 --> 24:35.330
You are mad.

24:36.200 --> 24:41.050
We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are
Yunkai, and we have powerful friends.

24:41.120 --> 24:44.720
Friends who would
take great pleasure in destroying you.

24:44.790 --> 24:47.720

we shall enslave once more.

- What?

26:17.890 --> 26:20.560
So, am I invited to your wedding?

26:23.140 --> 26:26.520

I didn't want it.

No? She's a beautiful girl.
You said so yourself.

will tell yourself when you fuck her?

Safe journey, Kingslayer.

34:46.600 --> 34:47.780
Nothing to say?

34:48.310 --> 34:52.530
I liked you better before. I don't
remember chopping your balls off, too.

Go on, then. Tell us what it means.

45:12.480 --> 45:13.950
It's not like that.

I wish I could tell him all the answers.
It would be much easier.

I don't want you talking to him anymore.

We're not going to Castle Black.

45:25.870 --> 45:28.290
I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there.

raven beyond the Wall.

The raven's been coming
to me ever since I fell from that tower.

45:44.890 --> 45:46.980

This is what I have now.

45:53.060 --> 45:57.160
You have a family.
You need to go back to Castle Black

45:57.230 --> 45:59.830
so you can get back to
them, where you belong.

45:59.900 --> 46:01.820
What if I belong in the North?

46:02.950 --> 46:07.170
What if I fell from that
tower for a reason?

46:07.740 --> 46:11.250
Is that what he's
telling you? That it's all for a reason?

46:11.830 --> 46:15.930
All these bad things happened because the
Gods got big plans for you?

46:16.630 --> 46:17.950
I wish it were true, little lord.

46:17.960 --> 46:22.010
But the Gods wouldn't spare a raven's
cold shit for you or me or anyone.

46:22.090 --> 46:24.340
You don't understand. You don't know.

46:24.430 --> 46:26.390
You don't know. None of you know.

46:26.510 --> 46:28.480
None of you have been up there.

46:31.770 --> 46:35.860
I had a man once. A good man.

46:35.940 --> 46:40.240
Bruni, his name was.
I was his and he was mine.

46:41.610 --> 46:43.280
But one night Bruni disappears.

46:44.280 --> 46:47.870
People said he left me, but I knew him.

46:47.950 --> 46:51.450
He'd never leave me. Not for long.

46:52.450 --> 46:54.080
I knew he'd come back.

46:55.920 --> 46:57.130
And he did.

46:59.130 --> 47:01.970
He came in through the back of the hut.

47:03.300 --> 47:06.770
Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really.

47:08.340 --> 47:13.690
His skin was pale like a dead man's.

47:14.850 --> 47:17.270
His eyes bluer than clear sky.

47:21.150 --> 47:28.000
He came at me,
grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard

47:28.070 --> 47:30.500
I could feel the life slipping out of me.

47:33.370 --> 47:34.920
I don't know how I got the knife.

47:35.660 --> 47:40.760
When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart.

47:44.590 --> 47:46.560
And he hardly seemed to notice.

47:48.840 --> 47:52.520
I had to burn our hut down with him inside.

47:55.350 --> 47:58.020
I didn't ask the Gods what it meant.

47:58.140 --> 48:00.860
I didn't need to. I already knew.

48:01.980 --> 48:06.860
It meant the North was
no place for men to be. Not anymore.

48:09.200 --> 48:13.120
I promised your maester
I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.

48:22.750 --> 48:24.300
QYBURN: How is the pain, my lord?

48:27.470 --> 48:30.390
What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?

48:34.510 --> 48:37.230
Well, we've stymied the corruption.

48:37.310 --> 48:39.230
Yes, we've stymied the corruption.

48:40.140 --> 48:41.740
You're a learned man.

48:42.150 --> 48:43.650
All the good it's done me.

48:43.730 --> 48:45.610
You did well sewing up this mess.

48:46.730 --> 48:50.910
You're far better at this sort of
work than Grand Maester Pycelle.

48:51.280 --> 48:53.160
Faint praise, my lord.

48:55.410 --> 48:57.910
So, why did the Citadel take your chain?

48:58.660 --> 49:00.510
Did you fondle one boy too many?

49:00.580 --> 49:03.510
No, my lord. That's not my weakness.

49:05.380 --> 49:06.850
What is?

49:09.970 --> 49:11.470
Curiosity.

49:11.550 --> 49:14.900
The only way to treat disease
is to understand disease,

49:15.680 --> 49:18.730
and the only way
to understand it is to study the afflicted.

49:20.480 --> 49:22.600
You performed experiments on living men.

49:22.690 --> 49:24.690
- On dying men.
- With their permission?

49:24.770 --> 49:29.240
My studies have
given me insight that has saved many lives.

49:29.320 --> 49:34.320
Dying paupers, I assume.
Men with no families to complain.

49:35.700 --> 49:37.830
You found them moaning in the poorhouse

49:37.950 --> 49:40.130
and had them carted back to your garret

49:40.200 --> 49:42.200
and opened up their bellies
to see what was inside.

49:43.210 --> 49:45.080
How many men have you killed, my lord?

49:46.630 --> 49:48.130
- I don't know.
- 50?

49:49.050 --> 49:50.470
100?

49:52.380 --> 49:53.430
Countless.

49:54.640 --> 49:56.230
"Countless" has a nice ring to it.

49:56.300 --> 49:58.060
And how many lives have you saved?

49:58.970 --> 50:00.480
Half a million.

50:02.890 --> 50:04.690
The population of King's Landing.

50:10.230 --> 50:12.830
You were in charge of the
ravens at Harrenhal.

50:13.650 --> 50:17.750
Did you... Did you get a bird off
to Brienne's father in Tarth?

50:17.830 --> 50:20.670
A bird flew off and a bird flew back.

50:21.660 --> 50:24.090
Lord Selwyn Tarth

50:24.170 --> 50:28.140
offered 300 gold dragons
for his daughter's safe return.

50:28.210 --> 50:29.550
A fair offer.

50:29.630 --> 50:31.430
A fair offer. Locke won't take it.

50:33.340 --> 50:34.340
Why not?

50:35.010 --> 50:38.310
He's convinced Lord Tarth
owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.

50:39.640 --> 50:40.640
(SIGHS)

50:40.720 --> 50:42.520
He feels he's being cheated.

50:43.520 --> 50:45.440
They'd be fools to kill her.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.690
These men have been at war a long time.

50:47.810 --> 50:49.990
Most of them will be dead by winter.

50:50.070 --> 50:52.790
She'll be their entertainment tonight.

50:53.780 --> 50:56.370
Beyond tonight,
I don't think they care very much.

51:02.120 --> 51:03.670
(HORSE NEIGHING)

51:16.680 --> 51:18.390
We have to return to Harrenhal.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.770
- Why?
- I've left something behind.

51:21.850 --> 51:25.320
Absolutely not.
I've got orders from Lord Bolton.

51:25.390 --> 51:27.190
And what are those orders?

51:27.270 --> 51:30.020
To deliver you
to your father at King's Landing.

51:31.230 --> 51:32.730
You think you'll get a reward.

51:35.070 --> 51:37.740
I serve Lord Bolton.

51:38.160 --> 51:39.400
Any appreciation your father...

51:39.490 --> 51:40.710
You think you're getting a reward.

51:40.780 --> 51:43.540
Let me explain
something to you. When my father sees me,

51:43.620 --> 51:46.540
the first thing he's going to
ask is what happened to my hand,

51:46.620 --> 51:49.590
and I'm going to tell him
this man chopped it off.

51:49.670 --> 51:51.470
I had nothing...

51:51.590 --> 51:53.430
Or I could tell him this man saved my life.

51:55.590 --> 51:57.760
We return to Harrenhal. Now.

52:21.070 --> 52:22.950
- Eyes open, lads.
- Be quiet.

52:24.950 --> 52:26.500
(MEN SINGING)

52:28.160 --> 52:30.710
The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair

52:32.330 --> 52:33.930
From there to here, from here to there

52:34.000 --> 52:36.220
All black and brown and covered in hair

52:36.300 --> 52:38.390
He smelled that girl in the summer air

52:38.470 --> 52:40.890
The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair

52:40.970 --> 52:42.310
(ALL CHEERING)

52:45.680 --> 52:47.150
MAN: Don't spare her.

52:47.480 --> 52:49.070
Don't spare her!

52:49.140 --> 52:50.140
(GRUNTS)

52:50.310 --> 52:51.360
(ROARING)

52:51.690 --> 52:54.860
Well, this is one shameful
fucking performance.

52:55.020 --> 52:56.530
Stop running and fight.

52:56.820 --> 52:58.320
(BEAR GROWLING)

53:03.740 --> 53:04.960
A wooden sword?

53:05.830 --> 53:07.200
I thought you'd gone.

53:07.330 --> 53:08.710
You gave her a wooden sword!

53:09.000 --> 53:10.290
We've only got one bear.

53:10.410 --> 53:11.710
I'll pay her bloody ransom.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
Gold, sapphires, whatever you want.
Just get her out of there.

53:15.670 --> 53:18.220
All you lords and ladies still think that

53:18.340 --> 53:20.930
the only thing that matters is gold.

53:21.550 --> 53:24.520
This makes me happier
than all your gold ever could.

53:25.180 --> 53:27.430
And that makes me happier
than all her sapphires.

53:27.520 --> 53:32.440
So go buy yourself a golden
hand and fuck yourself with it!

53:33.190 --> 53:35.030
(ALL CHEERING)

53:35.110 --> 53:36.400

(SCREAMS)

53:45.030 --> 53:46.580
(ROARING)

53:51.500 --> 53:53.000
- Get behind me.
- I will not.

53:53.080 --> 53:54.250
(GRUNTING)

54:04.090 --> 54:06.270
What the fuck are you doing to my bear?

54:06.350 --> 54:09.690
Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him
back to King's Landing alive,

54:10.060 --> 54:11.310
and that's what I aim to do.

54:14.690 --> 54:15.690
Pull her up!

54:27.070 --> 54:28.330
(GRUNTING)

54:29.740 --> 54:30.920
Hold my legs.

54:51.930 --> 54:53.400
(GRUNTS)

54:54.770 --> 54:56.240
Pull him up!

(MEN JEERING)

55:04.110 --> 55:05.450
(PANTING)

55:06.660 --> 55:08.620
The bitch stays.

55:11.490 --> 55:14.920
We're taking her
to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.

55:17.710 --> 55:19.180
She belongs to me.

55:19.710 --> 55:22.050
Lord Bolton's orders.

55:22.130 --> 55:24.930
JAIME: What do you
think is more important to Lord Bolton?

55:25.260 --> 55:26.630
Getting his pet rat a reward

55:26.720 --> 55:30.020
or ensuring Tywin Lannister
gets his son back alive?

55:45.650 --> 55:47.160
(BEAR ROARING)

55:50.660 --> 55:53.160
Well, we must be on our way.

55:57.120 --> 55:58.840
Sorry about the sapphires.

56:15.680 --> 56:18.230
(BEAR ROARING)
