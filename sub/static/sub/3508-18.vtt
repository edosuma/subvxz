00:00.100 --> 00:00.902
<i>Previously on "Castle"...</i>

00:01.905 --> 00:03.007
Ask me why I'm here.

00:03.017 --> 00:04.917
You know, I ask myself
that question every day.

00:05.127 --> 00:07.028
That was Paula, my Agent,
with big news

00:07.029 --> 00:09.064
about my book, "Heat Wave."

00:09.074 --> 00:10.674
Are they really making
a Nikki Heat movie?

00:10.864 --> 00:12.366
Dude, did I call it or what?

00:12.376 --> 00:13.866
And you are
about to be immortalized

00:13.867 --> 00:15.101
on the silver screen.

00:15.206 --> 00:17.308
(Man) Yeah, I'd like to report
a murder. I did it.

00:17.370 --> 00:20.739
He called to report his crime.
It's like he did this for fun.
(Camera shutter clicks)

00:20.740 --> 00:23.642
Nikki Heat. He dedicated
this murder to me.

00:23.776 --> 00:26.277
Nikki Heat I presume.
It's Beckett.

00:26.312 --> 00:29.347
Special Agent Jordan Shaw.
Tell me everything you know
about Jordan Shaw.

00:29.381 --> 00:30.616
She is like the federal you.

00:30.626 --> 00:33.426
(Shaw) If our killer is obsessed with
Nikki Heat, Then so are we.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.649
So how long have you two
been sleeping together?

00:34.684 --> 00:38.079
Excuse me?
I <i>am not</i> going to leave you alone.

00:38.113 --> 00:41.325
Why don't you two escort
the body to the morgue?

00:41.360 --> 00:43.033
Once you're dressed,
of course.

00:43.068 --> 00:44.715
(Lanie) "b-u-r"--

00:44.749 --> 00:46.493
"burn."
Nikki will burn.

00:46.528 --> 00:48.537
Somebody always
has to die, Nikki.

00:48.547 --> 00:50.547
(Castle) If the man in the window...
(gunshot) was Ben Conrad

00:50.572 --> 00:51.812
he would've
shot himself on the left side.

00:52.036 --> 00:55.109
Ben's not our killer.
Beckett.
(cell phone rings)

00:55.143 --> 00:57.146
(beeps)
What, Castle?

00:58.493 --> 01:00.497
It wasn't Ben Conrad.
He's not the killer!

01:00.531 --> 01:03.803
The killer's still alive!
The killer's still alive!

01:03.838 --> 01:06.207
<i>(male voice) Good-bye, Nikki.</i>

01:06.242 --> 01:08.944
<i>Good-bye, Nikki.</i>

01:08.979 --> 01:12.250
(debris clatters)

01:19.593 --> 01:21.894
(Castle)
Kate, are you in there?!

01:21.929 --> 01:23.330
(bangs on door)
Kate!

01:23.365 --> 01:25.301
(bangs)

01:25.335 --> 01:26.703
Ouch.

01:26.737 --> 01:28.610
Ow! (grunts)

01:29.387 --> 01:31.155
Kate?

01:31.189 --> 01:33.592
Kate!

01:33.626 --> 01:36.427
(debris clattering)

01:36.462 --> 01:39.764
(coughing)

01:39.798 --> 01:42.936
Kate?

01:42.970 --> 01:46.475
(coughing)

01:46.510 --> 01:48.178
Kate.

01:48.212 --> 01:49.380
(coughing continues)

01:49.414 --> 01:51.383
You're alive.

01:51.417 --> 01:52.918
Whoa. And you're naked.

01:52.952 --> 01:54.420
Castle, turn around!

01:54.454 --> 01:55.822
(coughs)

01:55.856 --> 01:58.426
You know, your apartment
<i>is</i> on fire.

01:58.460 --> 02:00.963
Now might not be
the best time for modesty.

02:00.997 --> 02:03.533
Castle, hand me a towel.

02:03.567 --> 02:06.002
Your towels are on fire.
Well, what about the bathrobe?

02:06.037 --> 02:09.440
The... do you have anything
to wear that's nonflammable?

02:09.473 --> 02:11.709
Castle.
Sorry.

02:11.743 --> 02:13.645
Give me your jacket.

02:13.679 --> 02:15.147
(whispers) Okay, okay.

02:15.181 --> 02:17.415
Don't look.
(normal voice) I'm not.

02:17.449 --> 02:19.484
Don't look.
I'm no-not looking.

02:19.518 --> 02:21.654
Okay.

02:23.023 --> 02:25.593
All right?
Yeah.

02:25.627 --> 02:26.661
Okay.

02:26.695 --> 02:30.733
I dove into the tub
just as it blew.

02:30.767 --> 02:32.135
Yeah, can you walk?

02:32.169 --> 02:35.436
Ugh. Yeah, just...
A little banged up.

02:35.470 --> 02:37.637
Okay. Come on.
Nice and easy.

02:37.672 --> 02:39.706
Yeah.
Nice and easy.

02:39.740 --> 02:41.675
(grunts)
Are you in any pain?

02:41.709 --> 02:44.077
Well, not nearly
as much as you.
(sirens wailing)

02:44.112 --> 02:47.114
It's killing you, isn't it?
What?

02:47.149 --> 02:49.851
(wailing continues)
Having to wait this long
to tell me

02:49.885 --> 02:52.921
how you banged down the door.
You want me to start from the beginning?

02:52.956 --> 02:54.991
(helicopter blades whirring)

02:55.025 --> 02:58.295
(sirens wailing)

02:58.329 --> 02:59.963
FBI.
Right over there.

02:59.998 --> 03:01.966
(police radio chatter)

03:02.000 --> 03:04.001
Beckett. How you doing?

03:04.035 --> 03:06.634
Yeah, I'm fine.
What'd you see when you came home?

03:06.669 --> 03:08.736
The, uh, the doors were locked
like I left them,

03:08.771 --> 03:11.640
the windows were shut
and... I don't know.

03:11.674 --> 03:14.610
Nothing seemed out of place.
But I don't know,

03:14.644 --> 03:16.313
You know, 'cause I thought
the case was done.

03:16.323 --> 03:17.943
It's not, but you are.

03:19.357 --> 03:20.390
What?

03:20.423 --> 03:22.657
Till we find the right guy.

03:22.692 --> 03:24.792
Wait.
This is my apartment.

03:24.827 --> 03:27.928
Okay?
My life and my case.

03:27.962 --> 03:29.429
Okay, fine.

03:29.463 --> 03:31.362
My rules.

03:31.397 --> 03:33.696
You do what I say
when I say

03:33.731 --> 03:35.464
and how I say it.

03:35.499 --> 03:38.034
And there will be a security
detail on you at all times.

03:38.068 --> 03:39.535
Fine.
Good.

03:39.570 --> 03:42.571
Fire's out. You can
head up now if you want.

03:42.606 --> 03:45.574
(siren wails)

03:45.608 --> 03:48.878
(camera shutter clicking)
(man) ...Consistent with that pattern.

03:48.912 --> 03:51.114
(siren wailing)

03:51.148 --> 03:53.816
(man) checking for
secondary devices right now.

03:53.850 --> 03:55.017
(police radio chatter)

03:55.972 --> 03:58.006
Did anybody find
my father's watch?

03:58.040 --> 04:01.609
It's not in the hall.
The damage isn't as bad
in your bedroom.

04:01.644 --> 04:04.144
But your clothes do smell
like smoke and explosives.

04:04.179 --> 04:05.880
Does anyone know if insurance
pays for dry cleaning?

04:05.987 --> 04:08.455
I've got the blast seat here.
(camera shutter clicks)

04:08.489 --> 04:10.290
Well, it had to have been
a small device,

04:10.325 --> 04:11.360
otherwise I would've seen it.

04:11.470 --> 04:13.570
The lab will have
the breakdown by morning,

04:13.895 --> 04:15.795
but that's cyclonite.

04:15.829 --> 04:18.430
Same thing we found
in Ben Conrad's apartment.

04:18.464 --> 04:19.798
So what tipped you?

04:19.833 --> 04:23.036
It wasn't me. It was Castle.

04:23.070 --> 04:25.004
Uh, well, our supposed killer,
Ben Conrad,

04:25.039 --> 04:26.739
shot himself
with his right hand,

04:26.774 --> 04:28.341
Yet the man that
Detective Beckett and I

04:28.376 --> 04:31.510
saw in the window was holding
the gun in his left hand.

04:31.544 --> 04:34.278
The shot went off just as soon
as he stepped out of view.

04:34.313 --> 04:35.413
He wouldn't have--
couldn't have--had time

04:35.448 --> 04:37.048
to switch hands that fast.

04:37.169 --> 04:39.635
Our real killer shot Ben Conrad,
placed the gun in his hand,

04:39.670 --> 04:41.103
making it look like a suicide.

04:41.113 --> 04:42.337
We were outside the door.
We heard the shot.

04:42.338 --> 04:44.638
<i>Go!</i>
<i>(agents) FBI!</i>

04:44.672 --> 04:46.839
There's no way else
out of that apartment.

04:46.873 --> 04:48.507
So if Ben Conrad
didn't kill himself...

04:48.517 --> 04:50.917
then our killer was in
the apartment the whole time.

04:51.179 --> 04:52.281
How the hell
did we miss him?

04:52.291 --> 04:54.391
(Castle) Let's go find out.

04:56.583 --> 04:59.685
(knocking on walls)

05:05.291 --> 05:07.591
You guys.

05:07.625 --> 05:10.160
Take a look in here.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.422
I think I found something.

05:12.910 --> 05:14.843
(Castle)
What have you got?

05:14.878 --> 05:17.578
(grunts)
Maybe his hiding place.

05:25.517 --> 05:27.183
Whoa.

05:27.218 --> 05:28.951
Discarded clothing.

05:28.986 --> 05:31.987
(Shaw)
The exact same outfit

05:32.021 --> 05:34.455
Conrad was wearing
when we found him.

05:34.490 --> 05:36.991
(Beckett) Right down to
a fake beard to match Conrad's.

05:37.025 --> 05:39.827
The killer wanted us
to think he <i>was</i> Conrad.

05:39.861 --> 05:42.829
That's why the man
that I saw in the window,

05:42.863 --> 05:44.764
the one from
our eyewitness accounts,

05:44.798 --> 05:47.366
led us straight to Ben.
Which means the real Ben Conrad

05:47.400 --> 05:49.834
was being held hostage
in his own apartment

05:49.868 --> 05:51.702
the entire case.

05:51.736 --> 05:54.304
He must have been
bound and duct-taped,

05:54.338 --> 05:57.573
with no idea that he was
being blamed for three murders.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.574
Each of our victims
was carefully selected

05:59.642 --> 06:01.742
for their connection
to Ben Conrad,

06:01.777 --> 06:03.610
making him
the perfect patsy.

06:03.645 --> 06:05.011
The killer's a chameleon,

06:05.046 --> 06:08.014
changing his identity
to get close to the victims.

06:08.048 --> 06:10.582
He becomes Ben Conrad,
he becomes invisible.

06:10.617 --> 06:12.583
Nobody's looking for him.
And then we come here,

06:12.618 --> 06:15.053
and we find exactly
what we expect to find--

06:15.087 --> 06:17.355
our suspect dead on the ground--
case closed.

06:17.389 --> 06:19.456
Meanwhile, our killer
was right here,

06:19.490 --> 06:21.124
hidden in this secret room.

06:21.158 --> 06:23.193
He was here the whole time,
and we missed him.

06:23.289 --> 06:24.688
(cell phone ringing)

06:24.723 --> 06:26.723
(Shaw) I'll get
the evidence team down here,

06:26.757 --> 06:28.658
see what they can find.
Beckett.

06:28.692 --> 06:31.493
(man)
You are supposed to be dead.

06:32.253 --> 06:34.688
I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

06:34.723 --> 06:35.791
It was supposed to be over,
Nikki.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.907
It was supposed to be done.

06:37.942 --> 06:40.742
But now... now I have to keep going.
(woman) No! <i>No!</i>

06:40.777 --> 06:43.845

06:53.995 --> 06:55.429
He used her cell phone

06:55.463 --> 06:57.731
and then he left it on
so we could trace it.

06:57.828 --> 06:59.361
Gloria Rodriguez.

06:59.396 --> 07:02.162
This is her I.D. badge
from a hotel in Midtown.

07:02.197 --> 07:04.066
Probably on her way home
from work.

07:04.076 --> 07:05.296
Huh. Found a slug.

07:06.607 --> 07:08.007
Letter etching?

07:08.042 --> 07:10.843
(police radio chatter)
No, it looks clean.

07:10.877 --> 07:13.512
The other murders
were planned.

07:13.546 --> 07:15.546
This one
was done out of anger,

07:15.580 --> 07:18.783
wanting to be in control.
All because I lived.

07:18.817 --> 07:21.885
You can't blame yourself
for that.

07:21.919 --> 07:24.620
How did he know you lived?

07:24.654 --> 07:26.454
(police radio chatter)

07:26.488 --> 07:27.621
He was watching...

07:29.134 --> 07:30.269
at the aftermath.

07:30.401 --> 07:31.968
Everything about
this guy's profile

07:32.003 --> 07:34.903
tells me he was watching
at the other crime scenes.

07:34.938 --> 07:38.073
Yeah, but the first thing we did
was compare crime scene photos.

07:38.108 --> 07:40.342
Yeah, I know. We ran them
through facial recognition.

07:40.376 --> 07:42.311
But he was there.
I know he was there.

07:42.321 --> 07:43.921
He wouldn't be in the crowd.

07:44.045 --> 07:45.246
He'd know
that's where we'd look.

07:45.405 --> 07:48.773
(sirens wailing)
No, he hides in plain sight.
He's a chameleon.

07:48.808 --> 07:50.842
We didn't see him
in the crowd...

07:50.876 --> 07:53.544
because he was dressed
as one of us.

07:53.578 --> 07:55.445
(Shaw)
Same cop, 30 photos,

07:55.480 --> 07:58.515
not one of them has
a clear shot of his face.

07:58.549 --> 08:00.750
That is not a coincidence.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.685
He knew
where the camera was.

08:02.695 --> 08:04.215
He knows our playbook.

08:04.302 --> 08:06.403
I'm gonna get Ryan and Esposito
to canvass the other uniforms.

08:06.625 --> 08:07.693
Maybe they can get
a description.

08:07.703 --> 08:09.203
Not that it'll do any good.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.402
The last sketch we got of this guy,
He looked like Ben Conrad.

08:12.436 --> 08:15.171
Okay, do you have
a better idea?

08:15.205 --> 08:17.673
'cause I am all out.

08:17.707 --> 08:19.476
And if we don't catch him soon,
he's gonna kill again.

08:19.486 --> 08:20.786
You can't
take this personally.

08:20.936 --> 08:23.437
The hell I can't.
He just blew up my apartment.

08:23.471 --> 08:25.738
I think
that's pretty damn personal.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.441
Do you know how
they caught son of Sam?

08:28.427 --> 08:29.647
A p-parking ticket.

08:29.653 --> 08:31.121
Berkowitz parked too close
to a fire hydrant.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.979
All we need to find
is our parking ticket,

08:34.014 --> 08:35.981
and we catch
this son of a bitch.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.551
As smart as he is, he's got
a fatal flaw--hubris.

08:39.585 --> 08:42.720
It's not enough for him to be
smart. He wants us to know it.

08:42.755 --> 08:44.322
He wants us to <i>know</i>
he fooled us.

08:44.869 --> 08:46.736
All of his first victims...

08:46.770 --> 08:48.671
the personal injury lawyer,

08:48.705 --> 08:51.607
the dog Walker,
the taxidermist,

08:51.641 --> 08:56.511
they all link back to the death
of Ben Conrad's dog.

08:56.545 --> 08:58.279
How could our killer

08:58.313 --> 09:01.281
have known all the players
in someone else's life?

09:01.316 --> 09:02.583
He must have known
Ben Conrad.

09:03.139 --> 09:04.939
So that's where we start.

09:04.973 --> 09:06.374
We treat Ben Conrad

09:06.408 --> 09:08.375
as the first victim
in this case.

09:08.410 --> 09:11.278
And then we find out where
he intersected with our killer.

09:11.312 --> 09:14.147
<i>(man) The exact cause</i>
<i>of last night's explosion</i>

09:14.181 --> 09:15.881
<i>in Greenwich Village...</i>
Dad!

09:15.916 --> 09:18.485
Hey. Hey. Oh! Hey.
Aw, I'm all right.

09:18.518 --> 09:20.950
I'm all right.
Where's Detective Beckett?

09:20.984 --> 09:22.451
At the precinct.

09:22.485 --> 09:25.554
(exhales) I can't imagine
how she survived that explosion.

09:25.588 --> 09:27.555
Where was she
when it went off?

09:27.590 --> 09:30.558
She was there. She, uh...
jumped into the bathtub.

09:30.592 --> 09:32.626
The bathroom door
and the cast-iron tub

09:32.661 --> 09:34.630
protected her from the blast.
Oh! (blows air)

09:34.665 --> 09:37.699
Dad, why is that person
going after Detective Beckett?

09:37.733 --> 09:40.235
Well, at the moment,
all we have is a theory.

09:40.269 --> 09:42.837
But--but we know more now,
and we have a strategy.

09:42.871 --> 09:44.771
Do you think
he'll come after you?

09:44.806 --> 09:46.840
Oh, sweetheart.
I'm gonna be fine.

09:46.874 --> 09:48.577
You are stuck with me
for a long, long time.

09:48.587 --> 09:49.587
You know, I'm supposed to
move out today.

09:49.784 --> 09:52.018
I think I should stay here with Alexis.
Well, there's no need.

09:52.215 --> 09:54.582
Montgomery has someone keeping
an eagle eye on our building.

09:54.617 --> 09:57.051
But all the same,
we should be on the alert.

09:58.506 --> 10:00.540
(sniffs)
I need to go change...

10:00.575 --> 10:03.643
(grunts)
and go back and help.

10:03.677 --> 10:05.544
See?

10:05.579 --> 10:07.512
He's okay.

10:07.547 --> 10:09.514
(man) No, I appreciate
the information.

10:09.548 --> 10:10.882
Hey.

10:10.916 --> 10:12.384
Hey.

10:12.418 --> 10:14.453
Where is everybody?

10:14.488 --> 10:17.855
Ryan and Esposito
are talking to Conrad's sister,

10:17.890 --> 10:21.291
and... Agent Shaw
is briefing the mayor.

10:21.326 --> 10:24.227
Oh. I'm sure he'll be
less than thrilled

10:24.261 --> 10:26.862
to learn that Conrad
is just another victim.
Hmm.

10:26.896 --> 10:28.263
Nothing like the threat

10:28.297 --> 10:30.264
of being murdered
by a serial killer to stifle tourism.

10:30.298 --> 10:32.367
Yeah, and it doesn't help
that everyone in the city

10:32.401 --> 10:34.436
thinks that
we caught the guy.

10:34.470 --> 10:36.704
Speaking of Ben Conrad,
what have you found out?

10:36.738 --> 10:39.373
34 years old,
never married--

10:39.407 --> 10:41.874
I'm going out
on a limb here saying,

10:41.909 --> 10:44.510
judging from his relationship
with his dog, Mr. Bumpkins,

10:44.544 --> 10:46.578
he didn't have a girlfriend.
Yeah, well, other than the people

10:46.613 --> 10:48.981
that we've already run down
from the dog park,

10:49.015 --> 10:51.583
he doesn't even have friends.
The man stuffed his dog.

10:51.617 --> 10:54.886
Well, Conrad's sister
confirms that he was a loner.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.587
Told her that when he lost
his job a couple of months ago

10:57.622 --> 11:00.024
that he spent his days
e-mailing résumés

11:00.058 --> 11:02.526
at coffee shops that offer free internet.
And other than Bumpkins,

11:02.560 --> 11:04.661
his only other joy in life
was the Knicks.
Poor guy.

11:04.695 --> 11:06.729
Jordan said
the profile indicated that

11:06.764 --> 11:09.531
the killer hunted Conrad.
If he wasn't a friend,

11:09.566 --> 11:11.034
then he must have
met up with him somewhere

11:11.068 --> 11:12.703
where people strike up
a casual conversation.

11:12.713 --> 11:13.713
We figure if he camped out

11:13.899 --> 11:15.734
with his laptop
at a coffee shop, our killer

11:15.817 --> 11:18.116
could've sat down next to him,
and they got to talking.

11:18.126 --> 11:19.826
His sister said
that he was a Knicks fan?

11:21.226 --> 11:23.494
What's missing
from these pictures?

11:23.528 --> 11:24.662
Good taste.
Area rug.

11:24.823 --> 11:25.690
(Ryan) Decent lighting.

11:25.827 --> 11:28.761
A TV, which means he would
have to walk to a local bar

11:28.796 --> 11:31.197
in order to watch the games.
Yeah, if you're a Knicks fan,

11:31.231 --> 11:33.366
you gotta share your pain
with somebody.
True.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.535
Okay, you two
take all of the coffee shops

11:35.569 --> 11:37.403
within a 5-block radius
of Conrad's apartment.

11:37.437 --> 11:39.504
See if anyone remembers him
talking to a customer.

11:39.539 --> 11:42.440
Castle and I will take the bars.
And if you keep quoting Jordan,

11:42.475 --> 11:45.676
I am going to turn the radio <i>way</i> up.
(singsongy) Jealous.

11:45.710 --> 11:47.010
(snickers)

11:47.045 --> 11:50.447
<i>(the genders)</i>
<i>♪ and I said, hey, baby ♪</i>

11:52.392 --> 11:54.193
You know, pub crawls
are supposed to greet you

11:54.301 --> 11:55.767
with a smile
and a shot of jager,

11:55.843 --> 11:58.578
not, "no, we've never seen
the guy before. Keep moving."

11:58.612 --> 12:00.612
This is beginning
to feel pointless.

12:00.647 --> 12:02.147
Buck up, Castle.

12:02.182 --> 12:04.015
I got a feeling
this place is different.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.517
<i>♪ let's pretend ♪</i>

12:05.551 --> 12:07.552
<i>♪ let's pretend ♪</i>

12:07.586 --> 12:09.686
(Beckett) It's still
an ongoing investigation.

12:09.720 --> 12:13.054
So we're gonna need you
to take that banner down.

12:13.088 --> 12:15.056
I was just trying
to work an angle.

12:15.090 --> 12:17.024
You should understand
what it's like

12:17.058 --> 12:19.159
being a woman
in a man's world.

12:19.193 --> 12:22.729
Uh, did Ben Conrad
ever talk to you

12:22.763 --> 12:25.131
about the recent death of his dog?
Sure.

12:25.166 --> 12:27.933
He loved to flap his gums to me
about that little dropkick.

12:27.968 --> 12:30.602
One time, he cried.
Well, what about  the other customers,

12:30.637 --> 12:33.872
he ever talk to them?
He mostly drank alone and watched the games.

12:33.906 --> 12:35.340
Though a couple of weeks ago,

12:35.374 --> 12:37.708
he did strike it up with some guy.
Can you describe him?

12:37.742 --> 12:40.310
Average looking, a bit off,
like Conrad.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.779
They sat at that high top
over there.

12:42.813 --> 12:44.814
I figured,
hey, birds of a feather.

12:44.848 --> 12:48.417
This other guy, did he
ever pay with a edit card?

12:48.451 --> 12:50.885
The only time he ever said
two words to me

12:50.919 --> 12:52.453
was the other week when
he asked me to call him a cab.

12:52.463 --> 12:53.483
Do you remember when?

12:53.588 --> 12:56.089
I remember exactly when--
the Knicks were in overtime,

12:56.123 --> 12:59.392
and I missed the end
while I was on hold.
Thanks.

12:59.426 --> 13:01.893
Cab company said
that they sent a taxi there

13:01.928 --> 13:04.463
10:45, the night
of the Knicks game.

13:04.497 --> 13:05.365
You got the drop-off point?

13:05.523 --> 13:07.557
Yeah. West village, corner
of Varick and Downing.

13:08.994 --> 13:11.429
Home?
You know, I bet about 50,000 people

13:11.463 --> 13:13.196
live within walking distance
of that corner.

13:13.231 --> 13:14.864
We could canvass
local businesses.

13:14.898 --> 13:16.865
For an average-looking
white guy?

13:16.900 --> 13:19.969
I mean, we can't even be sure
what he looks like.

13:20.004 --> 13:21.505
Looks aren't
the only methods we have

13:21.639 --> 13:24.239
to identify him.
We also have behavior.

13:24.274 --> 13:27.408
You think you can idenfy
him through behavior?

13:27.443 --> 13:29.576
Well, originally, his behavior
seemed inconsistent,

13:29.610 --> 13:32.545
but that was because he was
pretending to be someone else.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.280
We know a lot more now.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.783
He is a show-off,

13:36.817 --> 13:38.985
a game player with
an exceptionally high I.Q.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.753
but it's not enough
to be smart.

13:41.788 --> 13:45.123
He also has a pathological need
to validate it,

13:45.157 --> 13:48.492
which tells me that he probably
belongs to an organization

13:48.527 --> 13:51.428
like Mensa or Prometheus.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.296
He is a chameleon.

13:53.331 --> 13:54.731
So we can assume

13:54.765 --> 13:57.266
that he is living under
a stolen identity.

13:57.301 --> 13:59.201
And he is. Literate.

13:59.236 --> 14:02.237
He has already shown
certain dispositions

14:02.271 --> 14:05.239
in his fascination
with Nikki Heat.

14:05.274 --> 14:08.542
So we've drawn up a list
of periodicals and magazines

14:08.577 --> 14:11.178
that he likely subscribes to.

14:11.212 --> 14:12.779
I get half of these.

14:12.813 --> 14:15.848
Yes, and you also
kill people for a living.

14:15.882 --> 14:17.516
In your books.

14:17.550 --> 14:19.518
This is a pretty wide net.

14:19.552 --> 14:21.453
So is Varick and Downing

14:21.487 --> 14:25.423
And so are memberships
in high-I.Q. societies.

14:25.457 --> 14:29.159
But put them all together,
and sometimes we get lucky.

14:29.194 --> 14:32.795
You mean like Berkowitz's parking ticket?
Oh, it's not always that neat.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.364
You just keep adding
pieces of the puzzle

14:35.399 --> 14:36.732
until a picture emerges.

14:36.766 --> 14:38.433
(Avery) We collated
subscription information

14:38.468 --> 14:39.868
from the profiled periodicals

14:39.902 --> 14:42.904
as well as member lists from
the high-I.Q. organizations

14:42.939 --> 14:45.838
within a 1-mile radius
of the Varick and Downing area.

14:45.873 --> 14:48.174
(computer beeps)
We got 17 hits.

14:48.208 --> 14:50.175
Run the names
through our database.

14:50.210 --> 14:52.244
Most serials have
some kind of indication

14:52.278 --> 14:53.379
Of violent behavior--

14:53.489 --> 14:56.190
Criminal or psychiatric records.
(beep)

14:56.224 --> 15:00.826
Negative for any matches.
All right. Well, at least
we gave it a shot.

15:01.215 --> 15:03.883
I'll have our teams interview these guys--
"huh" what?  Huh.

15:04.321 --> 15:05.822
This one here--
Chris Doherty.

15:05.856 --> 15:07.824
We've got
a recent driver's license,

15:07.858 --> 15:10.359
But according to
his social security number,

15:10.393 --> 15:13.627
Chris Doherty died
six years ago.

15:13.661 --> 15:16.162
His living
under a stolen identity.

15:17.840 --> 15:20.413
(Shaw) So does it say where
our dead guy supposedly lived?

15:23.380 --> 15:25.581
(Avery) his address
puts him half a block

15:25.616 --> 15:28.750
From Downing and Varick.
Okay. Now I'm officially impressed.

15:28.785 --> 15:31.719
Don't be.
Not until he's in our custody.

15:31.754 --> 15:33.888
Let's roll.

15:40.763 --> 15:41.796
(whirs)

15:41.864 --> 15:44.199
(crash)
(man) Go! Go! Go!

15:47.670 --> 15:50.104
(man) Bathroom's clear.
(man) Bedroom's clear.

15:50.138 --> 15:52.305
All clear.

16:55.457 --> 16:57.724
(Beckett)
He's done this before.

17:04.864 --> 17:06.432
Hey, I signed this.

17:06.465 --> 17:08.967
"to Scott,
write what you know."

17:09.001 --> 17:10.902
Scott?
Do you remember him?

17:10.935 --> 17:14.204
No, but I sign
hundreds of books.

17:14.238 --> 17:15.940
His manifesto?

17:15.973 --> 17:17.808
His manuscript.
"Dead Heat"?

17:17.843 --> 17:19.477
"Heat examined the bullets,

17:19.511 --> 17:22.046
"each of them perfectly engraved
with a letter.

17:22.079 --> 17:24.015
"she rearranged them
like scrabble tiles

17:24.049 --> 17:25.816
Until they spelled her name."

17:25.849 --> 17:28.883
A book? All of this
over a damn book.

17:28.918 --> 17:32.219
He was writing about his murders
long before Nikki Heat.

17:32.253 --> 17:33.687
"Night Terrors."

17:33.721 --> 17:36.455
Looks like it's about
killing prostitutes in Seattle.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.890
I remember that case.

17:37.924 --> 17:39.591
I thought
they caught that guy.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.795
Not so much caught
as found dead.

17:41.829 --> 17:43.363
He hanged himself.

17:43.397 --> 17:45.398
Another patsy
just like Ben Conrad.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.332
He gets away with murder.

17:47.367 --> 17:50.367
Why would he write about it?
Why risk it?

17:50.402 --> 17:53.436
Writing is probably
a symptom of his psychosis,

17:53.470 --> 17:55.472
like taking a trophy.

17:55.506 --> 17:57.408
He both memorializes the deed

17:57.443 --> 18:01.079
and distances himself from it
by turning fact into fiction.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.982
And then along comes
Nikki Heat...

18:04.016 --> 18:06.084
tailor-made
for his psychosis--

18:06.118 --> 18:07.652
one part fact,

18:07.687 --> 18:09.188
one part fiction,

18:09.222 --> 18:10.489
just like him.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.757
Who better
for him to challenge?

18:12.791 --> 18:15.226
He must've known,
by going after Beckett,

18:15.261 --> 18:17.162
we'd realize
Ben wasn't the killer.

18:17.196 --> 18:19.730
Why tip his hand?
It's part of the thrill.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.966
He needed to escalate
in order to feel alive.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.836
Or... he's a psychotic,
obsessive-compulsive

18:25.871 --> 18:28.872
and has already decided
how it has to end.

18:28.907 --> 18:31.742
Agent Shaw, we dusted for prints
trying to get an I.D.

18:31.776 --> 18:34.445
Problem is, there aren't any.
(Beckett) That's not possible.

18:34.479 --> 18:36.847
You can't live in a place
without leaving prints.

18:36.882 --> 18:39.817
Unless he doesn't have any.
He likes to play with fire.

18:39.851 --> 18:42.919
Maybe he burned them off.
Well, without prints, we can't get an I.D.

18:42.953 --> 18:46.189
We don't need an I.D. put this
back where you found it.

18:46.223 --> 18:47.924
Let's un-ass this place
right now.

18:47.959 --> 18:50.394
He's gotta come back sometime.

18:54.965 --> 18:56.165
(Avery) Agent Shaw,

18:56.199 --> 18:58.700
my surveillance team
is moving into position now.

18:58.734 --> 19:02.168
Copy that. Standing by.

19:02.202 --> 19:04.470
(Avery) Be advised,

19:04.504 --> 19:08.507
our subject is a white male,
6'2", approximately 200 pounds.

19:09.537 --> 19:11.305
Profile suggests
he's studied our tactics

19:11.561 --> 19:12.763
and has prepared
for contingencies,

19:12.940 --> 19:14.440
so communicate, people.

19:14.475 --> 19:15.909
If he shows, no one,

19:15.943 --> 19:18.210
I repeat, no one
is to make a move

19:18.244 --> 19:20.144
until Agent Shaw
gives the order.

19:21.629 --> 19:24.430
Man, it's all here--
the engraved bullets,

19:24.465 --> 19:26.400
the cat-and-mouse phone calls,
the cipher.

19:26.434 --> 19:28.202
Only it's--it's Nikki Heat
investigating,

19:28.236 --> 19:30.504
and she's always one step behind him.
Till now.

19:30.673 --> 19:34.207
Castle, what part of "un-ass"
don't you understand?

19:34.241 --> 19:36.272
All of it.

19:36.307 --> 19:38.305
For future reference,
it means,

19:38.340 --> 19:40.538
"get the hell out
and don't take anything."

19:40.572 --> 19:44.004
"un-ass." Nice.
(whispers) "un-ass."

19:44.039 --> 19:46.439
Is he always like this?

19:46.474 --> 19:50.043
Castle has the attention span
of a cocker spaniel.

19:50.077 --> 19:51.877
Mm. And the loyalty...

19:51.912 --> 19:53.779
the way
he follows you around.

19:53.813 --> 19:55.815
From what I've observed,

19:55.849 --> 19:58.718
this unorthodox partnership...

19:58.752 --> 20:00.453
works well for you.

20:00.487 --> 20:02.288
For now.

20:02.323 --> 20:04.357
Is it enough

20:04.391 --> 20:06.924
Is it enough for you
to hop on a Learjet

20:06.958 --> 20:08.225
six times a year,

20:08.259 --> 20:10.427
catching serial killers
across the country?

20:10.461 --> 20:13.129
I'd be lying
if I said it was easy.

20:13.849 --> 20:16.116
How do you manage?

20:16.151 --> 20:18.285
You miss a few birthdays

20:18.319 --> 20:21.387
and you make
a lot of phone calls.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.088
(police radio chatter)

20:23.123 --> 20:25.724
My husband tucks her in
every night,

20:25.758 --> 20:29.160
tells her that mommy's off
slaying dragons.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.863
The trick to this kind
of operation

20:31.897 --> 20:34.764
is having enough personnel in play
to take the target down,

20:34.966 --> 20:37.033
but not so many
that he can smell a trap,

20:37.432 --> 20:40.166
which is why we have to get
our people to go downwind.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.235
Avery, tell our guy
on the roof

20:42.269 --> 20:43.536
to find another spot.

20:43.570 --> 20:46.205
I can see him from the street.
Say again?

20:46.240 --> 20:48.240
The guy on the roof,
southeast corner.

20:48.275 --> 20:51.676
The one with binocs.
We don't have anybody up there.

20:51.711 --> 20:53.611
It's him.

20:53.646 --> 20:56.647
All units, be advised,
we have contact.

20:56.682 --> 20:59.016
Southeast corner
of Bedford and Downing.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.885
Subject is on the roof.

21:03.254 --> 21:05.021
We're blown. We're blown.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.490
All units, go hot now.

21:07.525 --> 21:10.193
(man) I repeat.
Subject is not in sight.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.761
Stay in the van.
You're the target.

21:12.796 --> 21:14.563
(scoffs)

21:16.506 --> 21:18.707
Now you know
what it's like for me.

21:18.741 --> 21:21.142
(police radio chatter)

21:21.176 --> 21:22.810
Take it.

21:22.844 --> 21:27.514
(man) ...Team,
seal off the West Side.

21:27.548 --> 21:30.850
That's him. He must have jumped
the rooftops.

21:31.010 --> 21:33.778
He's getting away.

21:33.812 --> 21:35.879
Beckett, wait!

21:35.914 --> 21:37.581
(grunts) Ow.

21:37.615 --> 21:39.917
(pants)

21:39.951 --> 21:43.787
(grunting)

21:43.822 --> 21:45.656
I said I--oh.

21:45.691 --> 21:47.158
Pardon me.

21:47.192 --> 21:51.060
(baby crying)

21:51.094 --> 21:52.794
<i>(crying echoes)</i>

21:52.828 --> 21:55.029
NYPD!
On the ground, now!

21:57.339 --> 21:59.473
(Beckett) Get down!
(grunting)

21:59.507 --> 22:02.175
(horns honks,
objects clatter)
oh!

22:04.744 --> 22:06.744
Stop!

22:06.779 --> 22:08.979
Stop! Police

22:09.014 --> 22:11.448
Oh! Whoa!

22:11.482 --> 22:14.350
(people shout indistinctly)

22:17.620 --> 22:19.887
(grunts)
Oh!

22:21.689 --> 22:24.824
(crowd gasps)
(man) What are you doing?!

22:24.859 --> 22:28.161
(indistinct conversations)

22:29.863 --> 22:31.664
(horn honks)

22:31.698 --> 22:33.531
(man) Hey!

22:33.565 --> 22:36.867
Watch it, watch it,
watch it!

22:36.901 --> 22:40.502
(grunting and yelling)

22:40.537 --> 22:42.771
<i>(man) Please stand clear</i>
<i>of the closing doors.</i>

22:42.805 --> 22:45.439
(door closing alert chimes)
(man) Are you crazy?!

22:45.474 --> 22:46.773
(buzzing noise)

22:56.633 --> 22:57.466
Freeze image.

22:57.680 --> 22:58.681
(keyboard keys click,
computer beeps)

22:58.930 --> 23:00.396
Zoom in.

23:00.431 --> 23:02.064
(beeps)

23:03.863 --> 23:05.932
Run it.

23:05.966 --> 23:08.368
(Avery)
Running facial recognition.

23:08.402 --> 23:10.370
(beeping)

23:10.404 --> 23:11.803
Scott Dunn.

23:11.838 --> 23:14.372
Busted,
you smug jackhole.

23:14.406 --> 23:15.773
(Avery) Foster child,
sealed juvie record,

23:15.922 --> 23:18.360
3-year stint in a bay area
psychiatric institute

23:18.427 --> 23:21.832
and a single arson conviction.
Where he burns his hands in a fire.

23:21.866 --> 23:23.299
He hit all the cliches.

23:23.418 --> 23:25.218
Last seen February 15, 2004.

23:25.253 --> 23:27.220
Six years ago,
he simply disappears.

23:27.254 --> 23:30.056
I want every bit of research
you have on this guy

23:30.091 --> 23:32.693
on my desk, half an hour.

23:32.727 --> 23:34.594
You know, I'll have my guys
contact Dunn's family

23:34.629 --> 23:36.429
in case he reaches out.
You're out.

23:36.463 --> 23:39.330
I'm sorry. What?
I told you to stay in the van.

23:39.561 --> 23:42.730
I just broke this case.
I need people backing me I can trust.

23:42.764 --> 23:45.399
Whoa. Hold on--
sorry, Detective. You're off the case.

23:49.372 --> 23:51.240
(Montgomery) She's got jurisdiction, Beckett.
There's nothing I can do.

23:51.442 --> 23:53.876
Sir, this is my case.
He's coming after me.

23:53.910 --> 23:56.612
Like it or not,
I'm already on the front line.

23:56.783 --> 23:59.250
You and Castle found him.
That's the hard part.

23:59.284 --> 24:01.250
They've frozen his financials.
They've alerted T.S.A.

24:01.285 --> 24:03.552
His face is all over the news.
We've got him cornered.

24:03.562 --> 24:04.662
And you're the one
who taught me

24:04.741 --> 24:05.974
that when you have
an animal cornered,

24:06.128 --> 24:07.996
that that's when they're
the most unpredictable.

24:08.006 --> 24:09.826
Yes, and that's also
when they make mistakes.

24:10.010 --> 24:11.777
He does something stupid,
and we will take him down.

24:12.135 --> 24:13.536
And you been
running flat out for days.

24:13.716 --> 24:14.618
You need to go home
and get some sleep.

24:14.628 --> 24:16.028
Sir, I don't have a home.

24:16.752 --> 24:18.754
Yes, you do.
It's a secured building

24:18.788 --> 24:21.824
with an extra bedroom,
with people who care about you,

24:21.858 --> 24:23.691
with a federal detail
at the door.

24:23.726 --> 24:24.828
It's the safest place
in the city.

24:24.838 --> 24:26.538
Thank you, Castle,
but I couldn't.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.301
You can and you will.

24:28.335 --> 24:30.805
Detective, I took that security
off of your apartment,

24:30.840 --> 24:33.108
and that gave him
an opportunity to get to you,

24:33.142 --> 24:35.976
and I'm <i>not</i> gonna make
the same mistake twice.

24:36.011 --> 24:38.145
Consider it an order.

24:45.036 --> 24:45.870
(Beckett)
Well, who would've thought

24:45.956 --> 24:49.524
that I would be homeless
and caseless in one day?

24:49.559 --> 24:52.027
I know I'm the king
of going rogue,

24:52.061 --> 24:55.396
but you were right
to chase after Dunn.

24:55.431 --> 24:57.932
And Agent Shaw was right
to kick me off the case.

24:57.966 --> 25:00.335
I would've done the same thing
if I was in her spot.

25:00.495 --> 25:02.496
I'm too close to it.

25:02.530 --> 25:04.130
I'm sure after all this,

25:04.165 --> 25:06.498
you're a little sorry
you let me follow you around.

25:06.640 --> 25:10.674
No, not this. All the other annoying
things that you do, but not this. Hmm.

25:12.387 --> 25:13.454
What about you?

25:14.085 --> 25:15.988
Are you sorry that you
ever wrote "Heat Wave"?

25:16.126 --> 25:19.228
The way I look at it now,
if it wasn't for Nikki Heat,

25:19.262 --> 25:21.162
this guy would've just
gone on killing because

25:21.197 --> 25:23.798
he wouldn't have met anyone
smart enough to catch him.

25:23.833 --> 25:26.067
I'm speaking, of course,
about special Agent Shaw.

25:28.470 --> 25:30.338
Night, Castle.

25:30.372 --> 25:31.839
Good night.

25:33.243 --> 25:35.743
First thing in the morning,
I'll check your homework, okay?

25:36.926 --> 25:38.662
It's time for you
to get some sleep.

25:40.129 --> 25:42.163
(laughs)

25:42.197 --> 25:43.931
Okay.

25:43.966 --> 25:47.302
Aw, I love you, too, sweetie.

25:47.336 --> 25:48.804
Good night.

25:48.838 --> 25:50.005
(cell phone beeps)

25:50.039 --> 25:52.672
(car alarm chirps)
(sighs)

25:57.042 --> 25:59.179
(engine turns over)

26:01.216 --> 26:03.250
(gun click)
(gasps)

26:03.285 --> 26:06.187
(exhales)
Hello, Jordan.

26:08.057 --> 26:11.426
(sizzling)

26:11.461 --> 26:13.259
(keys jangle)

26:13.294 --> 26:14.260
(sighs)

26:14.294 --> 26:16.128
Martha.

26:16.162 --> 26:17.862
Kate.

26:17.897 --> 26:21.765
I--I'm here on orders
from the FBI.

26:21.799 --> 26:24.367
(chuckles) Darling,
I am hardly the one to judge.

26:24.401 --> 26:27.303
I'm sorry. I wouldn't impose,
but my place is--

26:27.337 --> 26:29.104
Ashes. No, I know.

26:29.138 --> 26:32.007
Well,
that explains the pat down

26:32.041 --> 26:34.275
by the hunky guy
with the ear bud.

26:34.310 --> 26:36.211
I assumed it was Richard
making a dramatic statement

26:36.490 --> 26:39.558
about the conditions
for my dropping by unannounced.
Mm.

26:39.592 --> 26:41.993
I just woke up, and literally
smelled the coffee

26:42.027 --> 26:43.461
and the <i>bacon.</i>

26:44.446 --> 26:46.347
(chuckles)
Dropping by to return your key?

26:46.381 --> 26:48.515
(chuckles) Very funny.
Very funny.

26:48.550 --> 26:50.617
No, I am looking
for my aqua gloves

26:50.652 --> 26:52.051
because these clash.

26:52.086 --> 26:52.852
(smacks lips)

26:52.991 --> 26:55.192
Well, she cooks. Mm.
Mm.

26:55.226 --> 26:57.192
Actually, my mom
was an amazing cook.

26:57.227 --> 26:59.160
She used to make
Sunday brunch.

26:59.195 --> 27:01.296
And I would get the choice
between pancakes,

27:01.330 --> 27:03.299
omelets, waffles.

27:03.333 --> 27:04.867
Wow, that's funny.

27:04.902 --> 27:07.002
Every Sunday, my mom would
have me make her an ice pack

27:07.162 --> 27:09.230
and a bloody Mary.
(Beckett chuckles)

27:09.264 --> 27:10.598
Mm. Don't listen to him.

27:10.632 --> 27:12.934
That only happened twice...
Tops.
(laughing)

27:12.968 --> 27:15.402
Gram!
There's my girl.

27:15.437 --> 27:17.470
Oh! Oh, I missed you.
I missed you.

27:17.505 --> 27:18.871
Chaca-chaca-chaca.

27:20.015 --> 27:22.483
You'd think it was months.
It's been a day.

27:22.517 --> 27:24.785
(cell phone rings)
(chuckles) Excuse me.

27:24.819 --> 27:26.720
(rings and beeps)

27:26.754 --> 27:28.354
Beckett.

27:28.389 --> 27:30.489
(whispers) Hot. Hot.
Hot.

27:30.524 --> 27:33.458
Okay, I'll be right there.
Ooh-ooh. Hee-hee.

27:34.191 --> 27:36.325
Castle,
that was Agent Avery.

27:36.359 --> 27:38.393
Jordan never made it home
last night.

27:43.531 --> 27:44.967
She left the precinct
just after 9:00.

27:46.063 --> 27:48.498
Husband said she never came home.
What about the car?

27:48.499 --> 27:50.366
Stationary at this location

27:50.367 --> 27:52.400
since the transmitter
was activated 20 minutes ago.

27:52.401 --> 27:54.569
Our vehicle security tech
said this was his way in.

27:55.443 --> 27:56.610
So he was already
in the car

27:56.812 --> 27:58.979
waiting for her
when she got in.

28:01.902 --> 28:02.904
Her purse is still in here.

28:03.079 --> 28:05.079
There's no bullet hole.

28:05.113 --> 28:06.881
Medium velocity spatter.

28:06.916 --> 28:11.518
So he leans in from behind,
she elbows him in the nose,

28:11.553 --> 28:13.220
he recoils...

28:13.254 --> 28:16.155
and a blood trail
flies from that direction.

28:16.189 --> 28:17.523
She took her shot.

28:17.557 --> 28:20.092
And left us
some bread crumbs.

28:24.563 --> 28:26.364
Here's another one.

28:26.398 --> 28:27.932
And another one here.

28:27.966 --> 28:29.833
His nose is still bleeding,

28:29.867 --> 28:32.401
But he has Jordan
at gunpoint.

28:32.436 --> 28:34.136
And he brings her to here,

28:34.170 --> 28:36.271
where there's a car waiting.
There's tire treads.

28:36.305 --> 28:39.307
(cell phone ringing)
Let's run down reports
of all stolen vehicles

28:39.342 --> 28:40.875
from the past 24 hours.

28:40.910 --> 28:42.343
(rings and beeps)

28:42.378 --> 28:43.778
Beckett.

28:43.812 --> 28:45.346
(Dunn) There's nothing like
the bond between girlfriends,

28:45.504 --> 28:46.904
is there, Nikki?

28:46.938 --> 28:49.406
You must really miss her.
Where is she?

28:49.440 --> 28:52.442
Safe for now.
If you hurt her, I will--

28:52.476 --> 28:54.510
Well, that all depends
on you, doesn't it?

28:56.145 --> 28:58.380
This is your story, Nikki,
not hers.

28:58.414 --> 29:00.281
She's just an extra.

29:00.315 --> 29:02.582
The showdown only works
if it's between you and me.

29:02.617 --> 29:03.984
Come to the Battery Park
Ferry Terminal

29:04.065 --> 29:05.698
at midnight tonight, Nikki.

29:05.733 --> 29:07.568
And come alone... or she dies.

29:07.602 --> 29:09.669
How can I be sure
she's still alive?

29:09.704 --> 29:11.004
I'll send you an e-mail.

29:11.038 --> 29:12.238
(chirps)

29:12.273 --> 29:14.573

29:14.607 --> 29:17.509

29:17.543 --> 29:20.944
<i>Say hi to your friends,</i> <i>agent Shaw.</i>
<i>Go to hell, Dunn.</i>

29:22.301 --> 29:23.702
I don't care if it's
your story Detective,

29:23.903 --> 29:25.004
I'm bringing her back alive.

29:25.189 --> 29:27.157
It's not my story.
It's his.

29:27.937 --> 29:30.772
And if Agent Shaw was here,
she'd say the same thing.

29:30.852 --> 29:34.420
Whatever he's got planned, it's a trap.
If I don't show up, she dies.

29:34.455 --> 29:36.223
But if you do,
you both die.

29:36.482 --> 29:37.851
We need to get to him
before the exchange.

29:37.861 --> 29:39.761
We traced the e-mail's
I.P. address

29:39.785 --> 29:41.452
to an internet café
in Midtown.

29:41.453 --> 29:44.755
Not that it helps us
find her.

29:46.714 --> 29:48.182
There's
no reflective surfaces

29:48.217 --> 29:49.583
and the windows
are all blacked out.

29:49.795 --> 29:52.295
Not all of them. Look.

29:52.329 --> 29:54.129
What's out that window?

29:54.164 --> 29:57.598
Agent Avery, if you don't mind
me rejoining this investigation,

29:57.632 --> 29:59.566
I suggest we take this party
next door.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.535
(Avery) Zoom in.

30:01.570 --> 30:02.803
(beeping)

30:02.838 --> 30:04.905
(Esposito)
What are those, buildings?

30:04.939 --> 30:06.840
Bridge towers.

30:06.874 --> 30:08.875
Call up all the Bridges
in the city,

30:08.909 --> 30:10.843
See if
our partial view fits.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.578
(clicks keyboard keys,
computer chirps)

30:12.612 --> 30:14.445
(Ryan) Ah, the whitestone.

30:14.480 --> 30:18.017
That means we're looking South and east.
But we still need another coordinate

30:18.051 --> 30:20.352
to find him on the axis.
Play the audio again,

30:20.386 --> 30:22.087
but this time,
without the voices.

30:22.122 --> 30:25.023
(computer chirps)
<i>(horns honking,</i>
<i>vehicles moving)</i>

30:25.058 --> 30:28.125
And get rid of
all the traffic as well.
<i>(rumbling)</i>

30:28.988 --> 30:30.555
That's a subway,

30:30.680 --> 30:32.413
and not just any subway.

30:32.448 --> 30:33.415
Those are elevated tracks.

30:33.587 --> 30:35.957
I'll pull up
the subway map.

30:35.992 --> 30:37.492
(keyboard keys click)

30:37.527 --> 30:39.694
(computer chirps and beeps)

30:39.729 --> 30:41.995
(chirp)

30:43.205 --> 30:46.441
That's the I.R.T. Pelham line.

30:46.475 --> 30:48.376
What's the stop
that intersects?

30:48.411 --> 30:49.844
(clicks keyboard keys)

30:49.878 --> 30:51.145
(computer chirps)

30:51.179 --> 30:53.162
(Beckett)
Zerega Avenue station.

31:03.700 --> 31:06.567
(Beckett) Got it. 1756 48th Avenue,
the Bronx.

31:06.869 --> 31:08.868
Have hostage rescue team
meet us there.

31:09.269 --> 31:10.869
(helicopter blades whirring)

31:10.903 --> 31:13.371
(man) Alpha team in place.
Standing by.

31:13.405 --> 31:14.939
(Avery)
This is the place.

31:14.973 --> 31:16.439
Building's
supposed to be abandoned.

31:16.474 --> 31:18.741
Thermal confirms a hot spot
on the fourth floor.

31:18.776 --> 31:19.944
That's where
he's holding her.

31:20.467 --> 31:22.035
My team's gonna enter on
this blind side of the building.

31:22.045 --> 31:24.024
This is wrong.
What's wrong?

31:24.025 --> 31:26.625
I feel like Princess Leia
when the "Millennium Falcon"

31:26.659 --> 31:28.262
Escaped the "Death Star"--
it's too easy.

31:28.272 --> 31:29.372
What do you mean,
"too easy"?

31:29.596 --> 31:32.064
I mean the sneak peek out
the window, waiting to record

31:32.098 --> 31:34.498
the message just as the train
was going by. He led us here.

31:34.533 --> 31:36.034
You remember how perfect
everything was with Conrad?

31:36.044 --> 31:37.544
Yeah, I got
the trap memo, too.

31:38.093 --> 31:39.694
But that doesn't mean I'm gonna
sit on my ass and do nothing.

31:39.834 --> 31:41.067
That's my partner up there.

31:41.207 --> 31:43.041
(man) Alpha team standing by.

31:43.075 --> 31:45.576
She'll be dead the moment
you breach that door.

31:45.586 --> 31:46.886
That's why
we're not gonna breach.

31:47.369 --> 31:49.069
Hostage exchange
goes down at midnight.

31:49.104 --> 31:51.305
That means he has to move her
before then.

31:51.339 --> 31:53.273
We move in quietly,
take position...

31:53.308 --> 31:55.842
and then as soon as Dunn
comes out... I'll put him down...

31:55.876 --> 31:58.878
(gun slide clicks)
like the rabid dog he is.

32:04.050 --> 32:06.485
Making entry
on the South side.

32:33.342 --> 32:36.276
(beeping)

32:40.173 --> 32:42.675
(Castle) I don't know how he's
doing it, but he's not up there.

32:42.859 --> 32:43.859
And what are you
basing that on?

32:44.001 --> 32:47.735
I don't know how I know. I just...
You just what?

32:49.107 --> 32:51.208
Castle, you and I have known
each other long enough

32:51.218 --> 32:53.518
for me to know, that sometimes your
silly theories are right.

32:53.717 --> 32:56.120
So if you have a reason to
believe that he's not up there,

32:56.215 --> 32:58.216
then you need
to tell me why, now.

32:58.250 --> 33:00.018
Just because...

33:01.772 --> 33:03.573
It's not
how I would write it.

33:04.419 --> 33:06.021
What happens
in your version?

33:06.343 --> 33:09.312
He lets us think we found him
to lure us here.

33:09.347 --> 33:10.814
Lets the FBI

33:10.848 --> 33:12.284
converge on the building,
only he's not in there.

33:12.465 --> 33:13.401
Where is he?

33:13.411 --> 33:16.511
Nearby, watching.
Watching it all unfold.

33:16.765 --> 33:18.933
He's got something planned.
If it were me...

33:18.967 --> 33:22.168
<i>(Castle) I'd wait until</i>
<i>they all got inside,</i>

33:22.202 --> 33:24.035
<i>got settled into position...</i>
(beep)

33:24.069 --> 33:26.571
<i>and then</i>
<i>I'd blow the building.</i>
(beep)

33:26.605 --> 33:28.906
Where is he watching from?

33:28.940 --> 33:33.309
I don't know. He wants
to show he's smarter than us.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.345
<i>So he'll be somewhere close by</i>
<i>and out of the way.</i>

33:36.379 --> 33:38.280
<i>(Beckett) Castle...</i>

33:38.314 --> 33:40.014
If it were you,

33:40.048 --> 33:42.014
where would you
be watching from?

33:42.048 --> 33:45.183
I wouldn't be watching from
this building where they are.

33:45.217 --> 33:47.152
I'd be watching from here.

33:50.689 --> 33:52.888
Come on.

33:55.224 --> 33:56.691
(door opens)

33:56.725 --> 33:59.460
(footsteps retreat)

33:59.494 --> 34:02.761
(object clatters)

34:03.910 --> 34:05.210
Here.

34:05.351 --> 34:06.754
You want me to hold it
while you tie your shoe?

34:06.935 --> 34:08.904
No, I want you to take it,
just in case.

34:13.908 --> 34:16.242
All right. Let's go.
(gun slide clicks)

34:16.275 --> 34:17.643
(click)

34:28.454 --> 34:32.389
(Dunn) I'm almost sad to see it
come to an end, Agent Shaw.

34:32.424 --> 34:35.760
You know,
I'd expected more from you.

34:35.793 --> 34:38.161
(Dunn speaks indistinctly)
(whispering)
Castle, he's there.

34:38.196 --> 34:39.730
I'm gonna draw him away.

34:39.764 --> 34:42.364
You free Agent Shaw
and get some help.

34:42.399 --> 34:44.033
Castle...

34:44.067 --> 34:46.134
You're my only backup.

34:46.168 --> 34:48.268
Okay, go.

34:54.809 --> 34:58.710
I thought it was me
you were after.

35:01.779 --> 35:04.813
Nikki...

35:04.847 --> 35:07.217
You came.

35:09.434 --> 35:12.769
Put your hands up, Dunn,
or I will take you down.

35:18.745 --> 35:20.945
I've got
a better idea, Nikki.

35:20.980 --> 35:23.014
Why don't you
put your gun down?

35:24.243 --> 35:26.745
Or I'll detonate
the 19 pounds of cyclonite

35:26.779 --> 35:30.082
that I have in the building
across the street...

35:30.117 --> 35:32.618
<i>turning Agent avery</i>
<i>and his entry team into mist.</i>

35:33.122 --> 35:34.323
If you shoot me, Nikki,

35:34.991 --> 35:37.257
it might cause my thumb
to tense up

35:37.292 --> 35:38.291
and push the button.

35:38.635 --> 35:41.400
Do you really want
to take that chance?

35:41.435 --> 35:44.269
They're not
in the building anymore.

35:44.304 --> 35:48.007
I only sent them in there
to throw you off.

35:49.410 --> 35:51.344
You're lying. (chuckles)

35:51.378 --> 35:53.613
Why would they be in there

35:53.647 --> 35:56.115
if I knew
that you were in here?

35:56.149 --> 35:59.554
Face it, Dunn. I beat you.

35:59.588 --> 36:01.888
Nikki Heat won.

36:02.723 --> 36:05.590
No.

36:05.625 --> 36:07.725
No!
No!

36:07.760 --> 36:09.760
(Shaw grunts)

36:09.794 --> 36:11.394
(Dunn pants)
(gunshot)

36:11.428 --> 36:13.429
(Dunn grunts)
(gunshot)

36:19.703 --> 36:21.403
(rips)
Where's my people?

36:21.438 --> 36:24.173
Across the street, sitting
on 19 pounds of cyclonite.

36:24.291 --> 36:26.659
She was bluffing?!
She was profiling.

36:26.693 --> 36:28.394
Go help her.
He could flank her. Go! Go!

36:28.429 --> 36:30.196
I've got this.

36:40.304 --> 36:43.872
Dunn... give it up.

36:47.809 --> 36:50.478
Nobody has to die.
(banging noises)

37:06.198 --> 37:08.232
(thud)

37:08.266 --> 37:09.333
(grunts)

37:09.368 --> 37:12.438
(grunts)
Oh!

37:12.473 --> 37:14.040
(grunts) Ugh!

37:14.074 --> 37:16.175
Ah!

37:16.209 --> 37:19.311
(grunts)
Ohh.

37:19.346 --> 37:22.715
That's how all my stories end,
with someone else dead.
Ohh.

37:22.749 --> 37:23.982
No!

37:24.017 --> 37:25.984
(gunshot)
Ah!

37:26.019 --> 37:28.152
(grunting)

37:28.186 --> 37:30.987
I believe
this is your collar.

37:31.021 --> 37:32.521
Ohh!

37:32.589 --> 37:34.022
(Dunn pants)

37:34.057 --> 37:36.224
This isn't over, Heat.

37:36.258 --> 37:38.292
It's not Heat.
(handcuffs click)

37:38.327 --> 37:39.860
It's Beckett.

37:39.998 --> 37:41.366
(Dunn grunts)

37:41.400 --> 37:43.438
You have the right
to remain silent...

37:43.473 --> 37:45.509
so shut the hell up.

37:45.544 --> 37:47.413
(handcuffs click)

37:49.015 --> 37:51.217
Thank you.

37:51.251 --> 37:52.351
Ditto.

37:52.385 --> 37:55.387
(breathes heavily)

37:55.421 --> 37:56.788
Hell of a shot, Castle.

37:58.503 --> 38:01.805
I was aiming for his head.

38:03.649 --> 38:06.485
(elevator bell dings)
(indistinct conversations)

38:06.520 --> 38:09.487
Hey, we're thinking maybe
you could talk to Montgomery

38:09.522 --> 38:11.556
about finding some room
in the budget for those smart boards.

38:11.591 --> 38:14.492
Sure. While they're at it, maybe
they could buy us batmobiles.

38:14.726 --> 38:16.260
That'd be cool.
Yeah.

38:16.294 --> 38:19.262
Our murder boards are just fine.
For a caveman.

38:19.296 --> 38:20.963
(Ryan) mm.

38:21.997 --> 38:24.632
Agent Shaw.
I was just writing you a note.

38:24.666 --> 38:26.633
Dunn is being transported
to the tombs,

38:26.667 --> 38:29.535
where he'll enjoy his stay
in the intensive management unit

38:29.570 --> 38:31.935
with the state's
most dangerous criminals.

38:31.945 --> 38:34.065
Well, he's getting
his 15 minutes.

38:34.555 --> 38:35.656
That's what he wanted
this whole time.

38:35.666 --> 38:37.166
Yeah, but it'll be
on our terms.

38:40.010 --> 38:40.843
I want you to know

38:40.877 --> 38:42.945
that I learned a lot
from you on this one.

38:42.978 --> 38:44.945
You did
most of the heavy lifting.

38:44.980 --> 38:47.379
Honestly, the thing
that impressed me most

38:47.413 --> 38:48.846
is that you came in
with Castle.

38:48.856 --> 38:50.956
You know, some people
would call that foolish.

38:52.258 --> 38:53.858
You made a tough decision
on your feet,

38:53.893 --> 38:55.760
used the resources at hand.

38:55.894 --> 38:59.098
I'd say that's heroic
and somewhat poetic.

38:59.262 --> 39:02.397
In the end, Dunn did
actually face Nikki Heat.

39:02.431 --> 39:06.200
She is, after all,
part you, part Castle.

39:08.536 --> 39:10.470
He cares about you, Kate.

39:10.505 --> 39:13.505
You may not see it.
You may not be ready to.

39:13.540 --> 39:16.174
But he does.

39:16.208 --> 39:20.911
Yeah, well, the situation
with Castle is... complicated.

39:20.946 --> 39:22.112
Ah.

39:22.147 --> 39:23.614
(Castle) Ladies.

39:24.733 --> 39:27.834
Detective Beckett.

39:27.868 --> 39:28.836
It's been a pleasure.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.733
We'll see you around.

39:30.767 --> 39:32.968
Castle.
Thank you for your help.

39:33.002 --> 39:37.108
You are a valuable asset
to Detective Beckett's team.

39:37.143 --> 39:38.879
Well, it would be great
if you would call her

39:39.005 --> 39:41.472
and remind her of that
from time to time.
(chuckles)

39:41.507 --> 39:43.107
(laughs)

39:47.218 --> 39:48.886
Wow. What's this?

39:49.163 --> 39:51.130
Open it.

39:55.801 --> 39:59.103
My father's watch.

39:59.137 --> 40:02.305
Thank you.
You're welcome.

40:02.340 --> 40:06.041
I found it in the wreckage,
had it fixed.

40:06.076 --> 40:07.543
I've got good news.

40:07.577 --> 40:09.378
Yeah?
I talked to Avery

40:09.413 --> 40:11.414
about buying one of those
incredible fed-mobiles--

40:11.448 --> 40:13.015
without the weapons,
of course--

40:13.050 --> 40:14.950
But I could stock it
with my own gadgets.

40:14.984 --> 40:17.552
I could get "writer" airbrushed
across the back window.

40:17.586 --> 40:19.553
Ryan and Esposito have
a better car than you do.

40:19.587 --> 40:21.722
I'm just--I'm embarrassed
to have criminals in the back

40:21.756 --> 40:24.023
of that thing, and I don't know
about your seat,

40:24.057 --> 40:26.458
but mine's got a spring
that hits me in the--

40:27.393 --> 40:29.893
(laughs) Oh, Richard, darling,
you're just in time.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.326
I made dinner.

40:31.361 --> 40:33.395
Mother,
what are you doing here?

40:33.429 --> 40:34.863
Well, we're eating.

40:34.898 --> 40:37.699
You know, something families do
a couple of times a day.

40:37.733 --> 40:39.100
Hi, dad.

40:39.135 --> 40:41.803
Hi. So, uh,
what about Chet?

40:41.838 --> 40:43.237
Well, darling, I never said

40:43.272 --> 40:44.706
I was going to be chained
to the man's side.

40:45.423 --> 40:47.857
Besides, Martha Rodgers
is a woman of mystery.

40:49.705 --> 40:50.972
And in order
to maintain that,

40:51.006 --> 40:54.508
I'm going to have to...
divide my time accordingly.

40:54.668 --> 40:57.202
Like having dual citizenship.
Exactly.

40:57.236 --> 41:00.571
Besides, it's better
for my relationship with Chet.

41:00.606 --> 41:04.508
So if I have to eat
a few meals a week

41:04.543 --> 41:07.077
and do all
of my laundry here... (sighs)

41:07.112 --> 41:09.281
I'll just have to, um,
make that work.

41:09.291 --> 41:11.291
I think that sounds like
a fine plan.

41:11.315 --> 41:13.450
Hmm.
Well, I hope you'll be comfortable

41:13.584 --> 41:14.719
sleeping in
the home theater chairs

41:14.870 --> 41:16.338
I'm having delivered
to your room.

41:16.782 --> 41:19.548
They do recline.
Ahh.
