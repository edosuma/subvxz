WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.877
Previously on Black Lightning...

00:01.880 --> 00:05.140
The purpose of Black
Lightning was to kill Tobias

00:05.143 --> 00:09.078
for literally shoving my father's
articles down his throat until he died.

00:09.081 --> 00:11.163
Uncle Gambi discovered the
bodies of a bunch of kids

00:11.166 --> 00:12.366
who disappeared 30 years ago.

00:12.369 --> 00:14.192
He thought they were
dead, but they're alive,

00:14.195 --> 00:16.193
and they're kept in some
kind of suspended state.

00:26.937 --> 00:28.939
He's dead, you idiot!

00:28.942 --> 00:31.243
What about "alive"
didn't you understand?

00:32.679 --> 00:34.746
Dad. Dad, wake up.

00:39.639 --> 00:41.385
I'm gonna cloak this place against

00:41.388 --> 00:43.121
all surveillance,
satellite, you name it.

00:43.123 --> 00:44.664
You just need to stay inside.

00:47.289 --> 00:49.960
_

00:49.963 --> 00:51.997
I wish I could come to
work with you every day.

00:51.999 --> 00:53.532
I bet.

00:53.534 --> 00:56.134
But as soon as these fools
stop tearing up the city

00:56.136 --> 00:59.731
and your school reopens,
you're going back to class.

00:59.734 --> 01:03.341
"The future belongs to those
who prepare for it today."

01:03.344 --> 01:05.539
Malcolm X.

01:07.617 --> 01:09.514
Hey, go wait in the car, son.

01:09.516 --> 01:11.416
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:16.150 --> 01:17.549
All you were supposed to do

01:17.552 --> 01:20.223
was blow the whistle on human
experimentation in Freeland.

01:20.226 --> 01:22.894
Instead, you exposed
corruption, Al. You named names.

01:22.896 --> 01:24.029
- Good!
- No, no!

01:24.031 --> 01:25.263
Tobias Whale's been indicted.

01:25.265 --> 01:26.965
His corrupt ass needs to get indicted.

01:26.967 --> 01:28.733
You're playing with fire here, man.

01:28.735 --> 01:32.037
The last thing you need to be doing
right now is pushing for another story.

01:32.039 --> 01:34.806
But my editor killed it. But
you know that already, don't you?

01:34.808 --> 01:38.343
Take my advice and leave this
alone. Think about your son.

01:38.345 --> 01:40.278
I am thinking about my son.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.981
I had Jefferson take that damn
vaccine, and it was tainted.

01:42.983 --> 01:45.150
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

01:45.152 --> 01:47.085
There's no reason to get
yourself killed over it.

01:47.087 --> 01:49.325
No! There's no reason for
you to get yourself killed.

01:49.328 --> 01:52.791
All the reason I need in the world
is sitting in that car over there.

02:42.489 --> 02:45.457
More violence on day three of the riots

02:45.460 --> 02:49.281
after the shooting of unarmed
Andre Carter by Freeland police.

02:49.283 --> 02:52.017
Residents are advised to stay home.

02:52.019 --> 02:54.352
I've owned this store for over 20 years.

02:54.354 --> 02:56.421
Now, I don't condone riots,

02:56.423 --> 03:00.585
but they didn't have to shoot that
boy like that. He was running away.

03:11.554 --> 03:12.764
I got one.

03:12.767 --> 03:15.040
Need a little help out here!

03:16.810 --> 03:18.310
Stop resisting!

04:13.533 --> 04:15.476
Fever of 105 and irregular heartbeat.

04:15.479 --> 04:17.512
Is this normal after defibrillation?

04:18.553 --> 04:20.839
- Or did I...
- You saved his life.

04:20.841 --> 04:21.940
That's what you did.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.046
What's going on?

04:29.906 --> 04:31.583
He's got a short circuit in his powers.

04:31.585 --> 04:32.884
It's compromising his nervous system.

04:32.886 --> 04:34.352
Okay, okay. Well, we need
to get him to the hospital.

04:34.354 --> 04:36.221
We can't. The ASA is looking for us.

04:36.223 --> 04:38.590
So is Lady Eve's old cartel, and
not to mention The One Hundred.

04:38.592 --> 04:41.493
He'll make it. I know he will.

05:07.399 --> 05:08.598
Hey.

05:10.168 --> 05:11.774
Are you all right?

05:11.777 --> 05:13.544
Sure.

05:14.539 --> 05:17.340
I'm a freak from a family of freaks,

05:17.342 --> 05:19.843
and my dad's got one foot
in the grave. I'm fine.

05:19.845 --> 05:21.511
Well...

05:22.180 --> 05:24.014
when you say it like that.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.817
All right, not funny. Sorry.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.588
Who were those people with Khalil?

05:32.291 --> 05:35.125
Are they like us? Meta-humans?

05:35.627 --> 05:37.060
Not exactly.

05:38.196 --> 05:40.302
Meta-humans have organic powers,

05:40.305 --> 05:42.299
which means they come from within.

05:42.301 --> 05:43.566
Theirs are artificial.

05:43.568 --> 05:45.835
That albino man, he's their leader.

05:45.837 --> 05:47.871
His name is Tobias Whale.

05:47.873 --> 05:51.775
He takes a kind of a serum
which is like a super steroid.

05:51.777 --> 05:55.278
It makes him age slower
and get stronger over time.

05:55.280 --> 05:58.081
At this point, he's got
the strength of three men.

05:58.083 --> 05:59.449
My guess

05:59.451 --> 06:01.489
is he's the one who
turned your ex-boyfriend.

06:01.492 --> 06:02.724
Why?

06:02.727 --> 06:04.554
It's what he does.

06:05.672 --> 06:09.292
That man has a gift for seeing the
worst in people and bringing it out.

06:10.462 --> 06:13.863
That spooky-looking woman
with him, she's called Syonide.

06:13.865 --> 06:15.966
She was found in a dumpster
when she was an infant,

06:15.968 --> 06:18.232
with her umbilical cord
wrapped around her neck.

06:18.235 --> 06:19.430
Oh, my God!

06:19.433 --> 06:22.154
Tobias pulled her out of an orphanage
when she was eight years old.

06:22.157 --> 06:24.207
She was malnourished and abused.

06:24.943 --> 06:26.643
He clothed her and he fed her.

06:27.746 --> 06:30.036
And he trained her
to become an assassin.

06:30.039 --> 06:31.274
When she was fully grown,

06:31.277 --> 06:34.443
he had carbon-fiber body
armor implanted under her skin.

06:34.446 --> 06:39.422
And if she wasn't crazy before that
procedure, the pain did the rest.

06:41.393 --> 06:43.259
What did they do to Khalil?

06:43.261 --> 06:45.795
I'm not altogether sure.

06:45.797 --> 06:48.365
But it looks like he's gotten an implant

06:48.367 --> 06:50.467
with a synthetic liquid metal.

06:50.469 --> 06:52.369
It's bracing his spine,

06:52.371 --> 06:54.070
but it's also causing Khalil's body

06:54.072 --> 06:56.539
to produce a neurotoxin
like a snake's venom.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.289
It causes instant paralysis,

06:59.292 --> 07:02.961
so they weaponized him by giving
him darts as a delivery method.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.931
They made him into a weapon, but...

07:06.533 --> 07:08.366
he's not like that.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.588
Yes, he is.

07:11.590 --> 07:14.557
That young man had a
choice, and he made it.

07:14.559 --> 07:18.028
He is with Tobias Whale,
the worst of the worst.

07:18.905 --> 07:20.738
Sweetheart, whatever you may remember,

07:22.374 --> 07:24.633
he is not your Khalil anymore.

07:27.036 --> 07:31.906
If you wanna stay out here for
a while, okay. I'm going back in.

07:44.689 --> 07:47.123
Mr. Tobias, I'm sorry.

07:47.125 --> 07:50.260
I know you said not to
kill Black Lightning. I...

07:51.096 --> 07:52.762
I... I... I couldn't help it.

07:52.764 --> 07:56.232
So this is what, an apology?

07:57.399 --> 07:58.568
Yes, sir.

07:58.570 --> 08:01.263
Sy, what do you think?

08:01.266 --> 08:03.606
Should we accept Painkiller's apology?

08:05.243 --> 08:08.111
Good question. I have one too.

08:09.247 --> 08:11.815
Can you put a dart in me before
I shoot you full of holes?

08:12.851 --> 08:14.783
I know the answer to that one.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.689
Have a seat.

08:23.995 --> 08:25.929
"I am unlike other men.

08:25.931 --> 08:29.466
The laws of convention and
morality do not apply to me."

08:30.569 --> 08:34.404
That's Napoleon. And he
was a weak-ass Frenchman.

08:35.707 --> 08:37.758
You're Painkiller.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.995
Never apologize.

08:41.278 --> 08:44.480
So you killed Black Lightning
when Proctor wanted him alive?

08:44.483 --> 08:46.286
I'm not mad.

08:46.289 --> 08:48.435
Martin Proctor was down with Lady Eve.

08:48.438 --> 08:51.287
I always knew sooner
or later he had to go.

08:52.464 --> 08:55.265
Just gonna have to
be sooner, that's all.

08:55.927 --> 08:57.427
Real soon.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.181
Okay. Who's got 'em?

09:03.201 --> 09:04.968
We don't have them, sir.

09:08.473 --> 09:11.541
The only lead we could find to Tobias
is a street thug who works for him.

09:11.543 --> 09:13.024
Goes by the name of Lala.

09:13.745 --> 09:16.146
Really? That's it?

09:16.149 --> 09:18.782
A black drug dealer with a rap sheet?

09:19.742 --> 09:22.852
That's a rare find. This
the best you all could do?

09:22.854 --> 09:24.529
At the moment, sir.

09:24.532 --> 09:26.891
And the warehouse called.

09:26.894 --> 09:29.058
Putting the pods there
taxed the power grid.

09:29.060 --> 09:30.226
There's been a brownout.

09:30.229 --> 09:32.564
The backup generator
kicked in after 60 seconds,

09:32.567 --> 09:34.734
but the pods from
stage-one are failing.

09:35.711 --> 09:38.560
Actually, the pods are okay,
but the subjects inside are...

09:38.563 --> 09:40.003
How long?

09:41.163 --> 09:42.296
Ten hours.

09:43.408 --> 09:45.475
Unless we can get a DNA
sample from a meta-human

09:45.477 --> 09:47.911
with stable DNA to
rewrite the bad DNA from.

09:47.913 --> 09:50.613
In ten hours, I could
be back to square one?

09:50.615 --> 09:54.232
We'll still have the four stage-two
subjects, sir. As of now, they're stable.

09:54.235 --> 09:56.753
Four? Four subjects?

09:56.755 --> 09:58.855
Forget an army, that's not
enough for a study group.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.796
Everybody, stop working!

10:19.492 --> 10:21.547
I know you all think I'm a hard-ass.

10:24.431 --> 10:28.566
I'm a hard-ass because
this is a hard world.

10:30.121 --> 10:34.130
And now, we've got people running
around with superhuman powers.

10:34.133 --> 10:38.928
They are bioweapons, and we have to
have more of 'em than anyone else.

10:40.180 --> 10:43.114
It is up to us to make damn sure

10:44.259 --> 10:45.958
that if the American
flag gets any redder,

10:45.961 --> 10:48.755
it's with the blood of
our enemies, and not ours.

10:48.758 --> 10:52.029
Find Black Lightning's body
and this meta-human girl.

10:52.032 --> 10:54.649
We're confiscating the DNA we need.

10:55.796 --> 10:58.867
And let's find this Lala,
see if he knows anything.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.853
Let's make America great again.

11:05.890 --> 11:09.659
Failure is not an option.

11:14.232 --> 11:17.000
So you've known Dad the
whole time he's had powers?

11:17.003 --> 11:19.375
I knew about his powers before he did.

11:19.378 --> 11:22.216
You see, kids from the first
experiment who got powers

11:22.226 --> 11:25.782
usually had a flare before
their powers actually manifested.

11:26.645 --> 11:27.944
What was Dad's?

11:27.946 --> 11:29.846
Oh, he... he had two.

11:30.508 --> 11:34.771
First, he instinctively
shocked a couple of riot cops

11:34.774 --> 11:36.586
who were trying to whale on him.

11:36.588 --> 11:37.954
Then he got up and ran away,

11:37.956 --> 11:40.757
straight into an electrical
fence that should've killed him,

11:40.760 --> 11:43.294
but he absorbed the energy
without even meaning to.

11:44.229 --> 11:46.229
So why didn't you tell him what he was?

11:46.231 --> 11:49.297
Well, it wouldn't have done him any
good to know until it was a reality.

11:49.300 --> 11:52.841
It actually took him 15
years to fully manifest.

11:52.844 --> 11:55.685
And that's when he decided
to become Black Lightning?

11:55.688 --> 11:57.521
No.

11:57.524 --> 12:00.643
He made that choice when he saw
that Freeland was losing hope,

12:00.645 --> 12:02.266
and he knew he could provide it.

12:02.269 --> 12:05.959
Okay, we are literally walking down
memory lane, and this isn't helping us.

12:05.962 --> 12:09.263
I need to go out there and find
Martin Proctor before he finds us.

12:09.266 --> 12:10.591
Anissa, we are safe here.

12:10.594 --> 12:13.482
This whole property is
shielded against surveillance.

12:13.485 --> 12:15.552
And right now there are
satellites looking for us,

12:15.555 --> 12:18.003
listening stations trying to
pick up our communications,

12:18.006 --> 12:20.068
maybe even drones we can't see.

12:20.071 --> 12:23.966
Sweetheart, you are
the strongest among us.

12:23.969 --> 12:26.870
The best place for you
is right here with us.

12:30.442 --> 12:31.708
Come on.

12:43.079 --> 12:46.680
Yesterday, I felt this
coldness in my stomach,

12:47.759 --> 12:49.867
and I'd never felt it before.

12:52.263 --> 12:55.765
And somehow I knew it was death.

12:58.503 --> 13:04.040
And now I realize it was the
exact moment that you flatlined.

13:11.149 --> 13:12.782
We have a connection.

13:15.026 --> 13:17.399
I need you to find that connection

13:19.081 --> 13:21.125
and follow it back to me.

13:23.661 --> 13:25.061
Please.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.269
Please.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.143
Lala.

13:40.586 --> 13:41.985
I know you're thinking,

13:41.988 --> 13:45.499
"Why is this funny-looking
Negro always messing with me?"

13:46.878 --> 13:48.251
I love it though.

13:48.253 --> 13:50.646
Something about your
velour tracksuit-wearing ass

13:50.649 --> 13:52.588
I just like dragging.

13:52.590 --> 13:54.624
Anyway...

14:00.198 --> 14:02.999
Now, that's what they mean
when they say "levelin' up."

14:11.910 --> 14:13.543
Ah!

14:13.545 --> 14:16.312
- You hit like a bitch.
- Mmm.

14:17.215 --> 14:19.110
The Devil deals the cards.

14:24.621 --> 14:26.455
That's a corny-ass line too.

14:26.458 --> 14:28.124
But it's effective.

14:29.827 --> 14:33.462
I took your life in order to
make my purpose your purpose.

14:33.465 --> 14:35.974
I spent a cool mil on
your reanimation program.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.169
It's time for you to pay that back.

14:42.307 --> 14:46.809
Is LaWanda... and Will alive too?

14:46.811 --> 14:47.927
No.

14:47.930 --> 14:50.012
Just side effects of the reanimation.

14:51.285 --> 14:54.771
Eventually everyone you killed is
gonna come back to haunt your black ass.

14:54.774 --> 14:58.721
Tattooin' themselves on your
body until there's no skin left.

15:00.758 --> 15:02.458
"Tattoo-man."

15:04.062 --> 15:06.360
It's time to get back to work.

15:17.837 --> 15:19.985
Suspended, Jefferson?

15:19.988 --> 15:23.973
Haven't I told you that education is
the power they can't take away from you?

15:23.976 --> 15:25.509
He started it.

15:25.511 --> 15:27.645
Oh, but you finished it, right?

15:27.647 --> 15:28.746
Except you didn't.

15:28.748 --> 15:30.211
Sit down.

15:30.214 --> 15:33.416
Because you got suspended, and he
didn't, 'cause you broke his nose.

15:33.419 --> 15:36.880
You think that's the end of it
from him or one of his friends?

15:36.883 --> 15:38.275
I'm not scared of them.

15:38.278 --> 15:41.791
An eye-for-an-eye mentality
doesn't solve anything, son.

15:41.794 --> 15:43.682
Just makes the whole world blind.

15:43.685 --> 15:45.830
So, what I'm supposed to do?

15:45.832 --> 15:48.496
Just let him hit me and not do nothing?

15:51.771 --> 15:53.470
Listen, whose life is this?

15:53.472 --> 15:54.438
Mine's.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.085
And what're you gonna do with it?

15:56.088 --> 15:58.555
- Live it by any means necessary.
- Mmm-mmm.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.416
Speak up, son. What are
you gonna do with it?

16:00.419 --> 16:03.005
Live it by any means necessary.

16:03.008 --> 16:04.407
Exactly.

16:06.319 --> 16:07.918
I love you, son.

16:08.788 --> 16:10.087
Love you too, Dad.

16:11.023 --> 16:12.599
I gotta get back to work.

16:12.602 --> 16:15.059
- Read the Constitution.
- The whole thing?

16:15.061 --> 16:16.393
Mmm-hmm.

16:16.395 --> 16:18.796
Oh, you're not gonna sit around
here all day and watch TV.

16:19.398 --> 16:20.798
I'll quiz you at dinner.

16:29.442 --> 16:31.127
Jeff?

16:31.130 --> 16:32.588
- Jeff.
- What happened?

16:32.591 --> 16:35.112
His nervous system is shutting down.

16:35.114 --> 16:36.174
Mom...

16:36.177 --> 16:37.414
Is he gonna be okay?

16:45.191 --> 16:47.258
I told them not to bring me here.

16:49.395 --> 16:50.761
I'm sure you did.

16:52.064 --> 16:53.797
Where's Tobias Whale?

16:55.701 --> 16:57.935
I wanna tell you, but...

17:01.207 --> 17:02.476
But I can't.

17:03.776 --> 17:07.770
Then why ask to speak to me?
You're wasting my time, boy.

17:07.772 --> 17:10.513
Cuffs hurt. They too tight.

17:10.516 --> 17:13.498
Don't try to tell me you
people aren't used to those.

17:13.501 --> 17:15.334
Where's Tobias Whale?

17:29.735 --> 17:31.902
This idiot's got det cord in his mouth!

17:35.041 --> 17:36.407
A bomb mule.

17:36.409 --> 17:38.175
Albino son of a bitch is smart.

17:38.177 --> 17:40.844
He knew we could find Lala but
not him, so he booby-trapped him.

17:40.846 --> 17:43.247
Focus on Gambi and the meta-humans.

17:43.249 --> 17:44.432
That has the clock on it.

17:44.435 --> 17:46.635
We'll kill Tobias Whale when we're done.

17:51.823 --> 17:53.489
- Oh, my God.
- How bad is it?

17:53.492 --> 17:55.957
His vitals are dropping through
the floor. We're losing him.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.393
Daddy.

17:57.396 --> 17:58.929
Jeff?

17:58.931 --> 17:59.997
Jeff.

18:05.938 --> 18:07.471
Jefferson!

18:22.088 --> 18:23.220
Dad?

18:25.324 --> 18:26.590
Come on, sit down.

18:43.576 --> 18:45.175
When Tobias came...

18:49.148 --> 18:51.448
I should've... I should've helped you.

18:52.366 --> 18:56.135
You did help me, by
doing what you were told.

18:58.531 --> 19:00.765
Oh, but I always wanted to tell you...

19:03.996 --> 19:06.156
I'm so sorry.

19:06.159 --> 19:09.032
There's nothing to be sorry for, son.

19:09.035 --> 19:10.701
Black Lightning?

19:12.271 --> 19:15.239
All the violence?

19:16.042 --> 19:18.308
Peace ain't always peaceful, son.

19:19.686 --> 19:22.854
All the blood, broken
bones, pain you suffered...

19:24.050 --> 19:26.683
only you'll ever know it was worth it.

19:30.056 --> 19:31.822
Was it worth it for you?

19:33.392 --> 19:35.125
Your death?

19:39.098 --> 19:40.531
I don't know.

19:43.950 --> 19:47.652
What I do know... is that
I'm proud of you, son.

19:50.109 --> 19:52.843
And I apologize for leaving you.

19:59.952 --> 20:01.585
I love you, Dad.

20:04.890 --> 20:06.523
I love you too, son.

20:09.028 --> 20:10.828
But you can't stay here.

20:13.432 --> 20:15.132
Go handle your business.

21:06.318 --> 21:08.118
Everybody, he's awake!

21:11.615 --> 21:13.381
Daddy!

21:14.460 --> 21:15.726
It's about time.

21:15.728 --> 21:17.060
Dad, how do you feel?

21:25.120 --> 21:27.429
Take it easy, Jeff. Take it easy.

21:37.027 --> 21:38.594
My powers...

21:40.553 --> 21:41.952
I can't feel them.

21:43.088 --> 21:45.622
My powers are gone.

21:56.811 --> 21:58.547
We did a search of power company files,

21:58.550 --> 22:01.724
looking for a surge in energy output
right after the attack on Garfield.

22:01.727 --> 22:03.657
Got a hit. It was Freeland.

22:03.660 --> 22:04.944
Let me see it.

22:09.001 --> 22:11.568
I can't. It, uh... it won't come up.

22:11.570 --> 22:15.005
That's because it's cloaked from
satellite imaging. That has to be it.

22:15.007 --> 22:17.074
We are a go! Full tactical!

22:17.076 --> 22:18.341
Yes, sir!

22:19.111 --> 22:21.278
I've got your ass now, Peter.

23:07.593 --> 23:10.327
So, Lala never came out
of the ASA headquarters.

23:10.329 --> 23:13.013
We can't tell if he exploded, either.

23:13.016 --> 23:15.645
But some heavy tactical
is rolling out of there.

23:18.403 --> 23:20.370
Find out where they're going.

23:35.446 --> 23:38.054
Your vital signs are back to normal.

23:39.158 --> 23:40.891
Will I get my powers back?

23:40.893 --> 23:42.602
I don't know.

23:42.605 --> 23:44.727
What happens when you
drain a car battery?

23:45.922 --> 23:48.797
Well, it gets to a point where
it no longer holds a charge.

23:50.169 --> 23:52.029
My perimeter sensors are lighting up.

23:52.032 --> 23:53.565
They've found us.

23:56.241 --> 23:57.541
Damn.

23:58.610 --> 24:01.211
Anissa and Gambi can't
do this by themselves.

24:22.756 --> 24:24.256
Go, go, go!

24:24.259 --> 24:26.732
We're looking at 20 crack
operatives, combat spread.

24:26.735 --> 24:29.568
They're gonna breach attack from
the front and back simultaneously.

24:29.571 --> 24:30.803
Okay, so how do we stop 'em?

24:30.806 --> 24:31.915
We can't.

24:31.918 --> 24:34.943
These guys are every bit as good as
Delta Force and SEALs, maybe better.

24:34.946 --> 24:37.881
And they're gonna be equipped with
special weapons to deal with Thunder.

24:37.884 --> 24:39.783
Our best option is to retreat.

24:39.785 --> 24:42.430
Oh, Uncle Gambi, I'm not running away.

24:42.433 --> 24:44.687
Then your mom, dad, and sister will die.

24:44.690 --> 24:46.456
Okay, this is too much.

24:46.458 --> 24:48.058
- Jen. Jen.
- I'm telling you, this is too much.

24:48.060 --> 24:49.626
- Jen, we're good.
- Did you hear what he just said?

24:49.628 --> 24:50.860
- All right. Listen to me!
- I don't wanna die!

24:50.862 --> 24:52.062
Jen, listen!

24:52.064 --> 24:53.204
Listen!

24:53.207 --> 24:56.634
I'm gonna go out the front and
I'll engage them before they hit us.

24:56.637 --> 24:59.345
At the same time, Anissa,

24:59.348 --> 25:01.438
you make a hole in that wall.

25:02.741 --> 25:05.875
I'll lay down suppressive fire.
You thunderclap left and right.

25:05.877 --> 25:07.314
That'll shock them
enough to give your mom,

25:07.316 --> 25:08.979
sis, and dad time to make for the woods.

25:08.981 --> 25:10.696
- Got it.
- Okay.

25:10.699 --> 25:13.582
I'm in their comms, so we're
gonna know what they're up to.

25:13.585 --> 25:14.884
Bravo team set.

25:14.886 --> 25:16.186
We are go. Wait for command...

25:16.188 --> 25:17.520
- Okay.
- Jen, Jen...

25:17.522 --> 25:19.089
Listen, listen. There's
an emergency tunnel

25:19.091 --> 25:22.092
under a forked tree ten yards
into the brush. All right?

25:22.094 --> 25:23.526
There's a palm reader

25:23.528 --> 25:25.929
on the manhole that'll open for
any of you, but not for them.

25:25.931 --> 25:29.432
At the end of the tunnel, there's a
road where the van will be waiting.

25:29.434 --> 25:31.579
Okay? Is everybody ready?

25:31.582 --> 25:32.736
We're ready.

25:32.738 --> 25:34.070
All right.

25:35.841 --> 25:38.314
Can you light this thing
up without me powering it?

25:38.317 --> 25:39.743
Sure.

25:39.745 --> 25:41.211
Okay, new plan.

25:41.213 --> 25:43.103
I go out the front and draw their fire.

25:43.106 --> 25:46.489
Anissa takes them out, you
lead my family to the tunnel.

25:46.492 --> 25:50.219
Wait. But without your powers, how
can you do that and make it back?

25:50.222 --> 25:51.521
The suit's bulletproof.

25:51.523 --> 25:53.123
But your head's not.

25:56.461 --> 25:57.994
It's gonna be okay.

25:57.996 --> 25:59.296
Jeff...

26:06.371 --> 26:07.871
Be careful.

26:07.873 --> 26:09.306
Take care of them.

26:09.308 --> 26:10.640
I got you.

26:18.917 --> 26:20.583
This is suicide, Jeff.

26:21.575 --> 26:23.087
Light me up, old man.

26:35.708 --> 26:37.000
Jen...

26:39.451 --> 26:41.334
- Jen. Jennifer!
- Mom, don't get close.

26:41.336 --> 26:43.006
Jen!

26:43.008 --> 26:44.774
Jennifer?

26:48.700 --> 26:50.146
Jen!

26:53.685 --> 26:54.984
Dad!

26:57.676 --> 27:00.056
No, Jennifer, that's
enough! You're trembling!

27:00.058 --> 27:01.925
No! More.

27:06.919 --> 27:08.198
Jennifer!

27:08.848 --> 27:10.403
Jen, you good?

27:10.406 --> 27:11.901
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- What?

27:11.903 --> 27:13.336
I'm fine. I'm okay. I
just need to sit down.

27:13.338 --> 27:15.338
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Be
careful. Take your time.

27:15.340 --> 27:16.773
I'm okay. I just need to sit down.

27:16.775 --> 27:19.075
- Be careful. Careful, careful.
- Okay.

27:19.077 --> 27:20.176
Are you okay?

27:20.178 --> 27:21.745
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:21.748 --> 27:24.668
She's okay.

27:27.452 --> 27:28.518
I'm okay, Mom.

27:36.098 --> 27:39.362
Now, you are making a habit
of saving my life, young lady.

27:42.520 --> 27:46.472
Well, this is... this is what we do.

27:46.475 --> 27:47.841
Jeff.

27:52.243 --> 27:55.210
Even if you win, the ASA
isn't gonna disappear.

27:55.213 --> 27:57.680
If they think there's some
kind of meta-human arms race,

27:57.682 --> 27:59.661
they are gonna keep coming after you.

27:59.664 --> 28:02.318
Your best option would be to take off,

28:02.320 --> 28:04.366
make a life somewhere with your family.

28:04.369 --> 28:06.168
Whoa, and turn our back on the people?

28:06.171 --> 28:07.595
On Freeland?

28:07.598 --> 28:09.692
Let them make us leave?

28:09.694 --> 28:11.461
Nuh-uh, they don't know us.

28:15.100 --> 28:17.033
I'll help in any way I can.

28:19.712 --> 28:21.779
So that's it, then.

28:22.848 --> 28:24.315
High-low tactics.

28:25.584 --> 28:27.051
Let's do this.

28:30.927 --> 28:34.595
This is team leader Alpha.
All fire teams in position.

28:34.598 --> 28:36.595
You are go, team leader.

28:38.711 --> 28:40.510
Visual's dark, I'm moving up.

28:41.146 --> 28:42.279
Advancing.

28:43.382 --> 28:44.848
Got eyes on location.

29:15.810 --> 29:17.143
Team leader Alpha.

29:17.146 --> 29:19.858
We are not prepped for Black
Lightning. Request permission to abort.

29:19.861 --> 29:21.040
Denied!

29:21.043 --> 29:23.786
They came out of the house to
protect whatever or whoever's in it.

29:23.789 --> 29:26.295
Take out Thunder and get in there.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.301
- Buy me some leverage.
- Copy that.

29:28.304 --> 29:29.503
What are you doing?

29:30.129 --> 29:31.769
They're coming after us.

29:32.331 --> 29:34.743
Give me one of those.

29:34.746 --> 29:36.500
Give it to me.

29:39.071 --> 29:41.251
What?

29:41.254 --> 29:43.239
I grew up hunting with my dad.

29:43.242 --> 29:46.376
Now let's end this, 'cause
I want my damn life back!

29:48.113 --> 29:49.446
Talk to me.

29:50.314 --> 29:52.281
Major firefight in North Freeland.

29:52.284 --> 29:54.148
- A military team...
- Mmm.

29:54.151 --> 29:56.584
Up against Black Lightning and Thunder.

29:56.587 --> 29:59.456
That black son of a bitch
keeps rising from the dead.

29:59.458 --> 30:01.324
But this time, it's good for me.

30:01.326 --> 30:03.260
Proctor's best are all committed.

30:03.262 --> 30:05.862
Our best are right here.
Let's bring the party to him.

30:09.988 --> 30:12.855
Sir, multiple shots
fired, multiple perps.

30:12.858 --> 30:15.470
We got a war going
down in North Freeland.

30:15.473 --> 30:19.276
Scramble SWAT. I want everybody
with a badge in the car.

30:41.700 --> 30:42.933
Fall back! Fall back!

30:59.989 --> 31:02.422
Meta-human known as
Thunder has been packaged.

31:02.425 --> 31:03.725
Reel her in.

31:14.554 --> 31:16.321
Bravo team ready for breach.

31:37.210 --> 31:38.643
Mom!

32:17.951 --> 32:19.417
Damn it!

32:21.188 --> 32:24.456
Uh, sir, Freeland PD is on an
intercept with our firefight.

32:24.458 --> 32:25.857
Three minutes out.

32:26.860 --> 32:29.227
You're not helping, Klovic!

32:29.229 --> 32:30.728
Damn it!

32:30.730 --> 32:32.864
Abort! Abort assault!

32:32.866 --> 32:35.434
Secure the stage-two
pods for relocation.

32:35.437 --> 32:37.469
Send the operatives'
coordinates to the warehouse

32:37.471 --> 32:41.139
where they will secure the stage-two
pods and provide escort for relocation.

32:41.141 --> 32:42.340
Where, sir?

32:42.342 --> 32:44.409
Above your clearance, Klovic!

32:44.411 --> 32:46.010
I'll advise on site.

32:51.518 --> 32:54.119
Breach mode, everybody! Breach mode!

33:29.156 --> 33:30.588
Sir! I'm hailing all of our agents,

33:30.590 --> 33:31.956
but getting nothing but dead air.

33:31.958 --> 33:33.116
Burn the hard drives.

33:33.119 --> 33:34.218
With me.

33:44.934 --> 33:46.304
Go, go, go, go, go!

33:59.986 --> 34:01.019
Sir...

34:02.489 --> 34:05.490
Proctor. Proctor! Proctor!

35:17.109 --> 35:18.542
Where's tactical?

35:19.666 --> 35:20.732
Um...

35:22.002 --> 35:23.167
They couldn't make it.

35:27.641 --> 35:29.107
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:29.109 --> 35:31.142
You're not going anywhere.

35:33.813 --> 35:34.946
So...

35:37.033 --> 35:39.099
Family affair?

35:42.684 --> 35:43.921
I knew it was you.

35:43.923 --> 35:47.492
Yeah, and that's gonna be a problem.

35:47.494 --> 35:49.129
I am a federal agent.

35:49.132 --> 35:53.097
You will bring the weight of the United
States government down on your heads.

35:54.174 --> 35:55.770
That's bull.

35:55.773 --> 35:58.201
I suspected when you didn't
call in reinforcements

35:58.204 --> 35:59.837
after your Green Light lab was destroyed

35:59.839 --> 36:03.308
that this was a... rogue operation,

36:03.310 --> 36:05.777
which means we're not
up against the ASA.

36:06.746 --> 36:08.246
We're just up against you.

36:09.637 --> 36:12.705
Thank political correctness.
It's ruining the country.

36:12.708 --> 36:15.987
The first Freeland experiment
killed a lot of kids!

36:15.989 --> 36:18.122
And you thought it was a
good idea to do a sequel?

36:18.124 --> 36:21.025
They would've wound up on
welfare or in prison, anyway.

36:21.027 --> 36:22.460
Wow.

36:28.342 --> 36:29.741
Jennifer!

36:36.408 --> 36:40.243
Oh, man! That was
beautiful, little girl.

36:40.246 --> 36:42.313
- Is that right? You want some more?
- Jennifer.

36:42.315 --> 36:46.184
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Listen to me for one second.

36:46.186 --> 36:48.753
Most of them are dying.

36:48.756 --> 36:50.379
I can fix 'em.

36:51.725 --> 36:54.125
You wanna save your
people? Let's make a deal.

36:54.127 --> 36:58.629
All I need is a sample of
stable meta-human genetics.

36:58.631 --> 36:59.723
Yours.

36:59.726 --> 37:02.866
You want to save Freeland. I
want to make America great again.

37:02.869 --> 37:04.335
The ASA will back me up,

37:04.337 --> 37:09.107
especially when I give
'em the 411 on the Pierces.

37:09.109 --> 37:12.455
I'll get a blank check and
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

37:12.458 --> 37:16.914
So, either we deal or I come back
and kill each and every one of you.

37:16.916 --> 37:18.549
You're a monster.

37:18.551 --> 37:20.752
That's funny coming from you, Peter.

37:20.754 --> 37:22.120
You're right.

37:27.993 --> 37:29.826
I am a monster.

37:29.844 --> 37:32.245
And he is not gonna hurt any more kids.

37:33.456 --> 37:36.857
You all take care of the pods,
I'll take care of the trash.

37:43.080 --> 37:44.441
None of them are stable.

37:44.444 --> 37:46.110
Okay, how do we get them out the pods?

37:46.112 --> 37:48.713
If you open the pods, they will die.
They're too unstable from all the...

37:48.715 --> 37:50.848
How do we get them out?

37:50.850 --> 37:53.251
I... The briefcase.

37:53.253 --> 37:54.719
I need the briefcase.

37:58.124 --> 37:59.624
Never mind.

37:59.626 --> 38:01.845
I know someone that can help them.

38:01.848 --> 38:04.856
People are always calling
black folk paranoid.

38:04.859 --> 38:06.955
We always paranoid until
the truth comes out.

38:06.958 --> 38:10.501
They had them children for 30
years, and that wasn't enough?

38:10.503 --> 38:14.587
- They came back to get more?
- Damn. Bye, Felicia.

38:14.590 --> 38:19.076
This all ended with Black Lightning
and Thunder, not the police.

38:19.078 --> 38:21.145
That should tell you
something right there, right?

38:21.147 --> 38:23.400
The government put crack in the ghettos,

38:23.403 --> 38:26.567
they gave heroin to the white
folks in the rural areas,

38:26.570 --> 38:29.482
then they came back and
put Green Light in Freeland.

38:29.485 --> 38:33.498
And I know 'cause my son got caught
up in taking that Green Light.

38:33.501 --> 38:36.661
They gonna put something
else somewhere else.

38:36.663 --> 38:39.341
This is their MO. Ain't nothing new.

38:39.344 --> 38:42.233
The people of Freeland have
a right to a full explanation

38:42.235 --> 38:43.835
of what happened in this city.

38:43.837 --> 38:47.205
Hard questions are being
asked of the US government.

38:47.207 --> 38:48.873
And, in the meantime,

38:48.876 --> 38:52.811
although we do not condone
acts of vigilantism,

38:53.766 --> 38:58.282
the people of Freeland and this
department owe a great debt of thanks

38:58.284 --> 39:02.977
to so-called Black
Lightning and Thunder.

39:31.885 --> 39:35.152
They call us heroes, but
the real heroes are you,

39:35.154 --> 39:38.689
the people who, despite the
everyday struggles of life,

39:38.691 --> 39:41.592
continue to find hope,
meaning, and purpose

39:41.594 --> 39:43.694
in what can be a challenging world.

40:03.516 --> 40:06.717
We've been given a gift,
a blessing from God,

40:06.726 --> 40:10.895
and we intend to use it to
protect this city and its people.

40:14.694 --> 40:16.928
From our man in the coroner's office...

40:16.931 --> 40:18.529
Hmm.

40:18.531 --> 40:19.864
Proctor's thumbs.

40:38.017 --> 40:39.884
You...

40:41.626 --> 40:43.854
Shut up!

40:44.674 --> 40:46.440
You better hope this works.

41:08.781 --> 41:10.348
Mmm.

41:12.719 --> 41:14.071
Well, damn!

41:16.764 --> 41:18.235
Thank the man.

41:18.238 --> 41:19.522
No!

41:24.731 --> 41:26.540
Sy, baby,

41:26.543 --> 41:29.423
you're looking at the king of Freeland.

41:29.426 --> 41:31.435
Long live the king.

41:31.437 --> 41:33.104
First order of business,

41:33.106 --> 41:35.992
ripping the damn light
out of Black Lightning.
