01:15.709 --> 01:16.771
You OK?

01:17.669 --> 01:20.340
My head. I don't know
what's wrong. I can't sleep.

01:20.740 --> 01:24.780
A pain back here? Like...
like something bit you?

01:25.580 --> 01:27.889
Yeah. How do you know? You too?

01:33.730 --> 01:35.829
Mark? Listen,

01:35.929 --> 01:39.548
this may sound weird but...
is anyone else awake?

01:52.969 --> 01:56.279
Is anyone having trouble
sleeping or something?

02:05.749 --> 02:07.532
Mark, are you there?

02:08.919 --> 02:11.160
Wait for me here. I'll go.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.231
Gloria!

02:35.270 --> 02:39.389
We all need to get out of here.
It's a psychic attack.

02:40.030 --> 02:43.359
They're here! I tried
to make it back in time.

02:43.559 --> 02:44.930
It's too late.

02:50.969 --> 02:52.294
Yeah?

02:58.529 --> 03:00.068
- No!
- Come on!

03:01.790 --> 03:03.988
Remember your family.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.179
Remember the first time.

03:07.279 --> 03:08.979
Remember the terrorism.

03:30.309 --> 03:33.585
My head hurts.
I'm turning into one of them.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.650
Stop thinking.

03:36.750 --> 03:40.279
If you stop thinking they won't
be able to get into your mind.

03:40.379 --> 03:42.809
How am I supposed to do that?

03:45.449 --> 03:47.089
I know how.

04:08.740 --> 04:11.502
"Dark Sky: The Third Wave"!

04:11.889 --> 04:13.210
I know!

04:15.179 --> 04:19.060
All right, all right!
After this exclusive preview...

04:19.161 --> 04:20.320
by the way, thank you for that...

04:23.469 --> 04:25.389
which I should mention is being seen

04:25.489 --> 04:30.129
not only by everyone here but
also everybody on the Internet

04:30.229 --> 04:34.657
who's streaming the ceremony from
the official website. Hi, everybody!

04:35.989 --> 04:40.910
OK, but after this, let's bring an end to
this schlongfest, get down to business.

04:41.010 --> 04:45.183
Everybody give it
up for Jill Goddard!

05:02.259 --> 05:04.015
I love you!

05:04.470 --> 05:06.266
Thank you!

05:07.269 --> 05:08.369
We meant her.

05:08.470 --> 05:11.640
We? What do you mean, we?
You're the only one talking.

05:11.740 --> 05:13.739
I'm here with my friends.

05:14.389 --> 05:15.763
If they were your friends,

05:15.863 --> 05:18.770
they wouldn't let you make
such an ass out of yourself.

05:24.210 --> 05:29.810
OK, so, as I was saying,
after seeing this exclusive preview,

05:29.910 --> 05:33.224
I feel like I have to know

05:33.324 --> 05:39.193
if a certain "character"
gets killed this time around.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.270
The white t-shirt, Jill.

05:45.409 --> 05:49.309
You're asking me if the white t-shirt
I'm wearing in that scene survives.

05:49.409 --> 05:52.412
OK, I'm already a little embarrassed.

05:52.709 --> 05:55.589
Oh, come on, don't.
The "Coming Soon" sign appears

05:55.689 --> 05:59.110
right when my shirt is about to come off.
It's supposed to make you think about it.

05:59.210 --> 06:02.970
OK, I guess we're not gonna have
an answer for that question, folks.

06:04.569 --> 06:08.418
Jill, seriously, it is a huge
pleasure to have you here.

06:08.518 --> 06:10.129
Damn!

06:11.290 --> 06:14.591
I mean, in this one,
she's using her psychic powers...

06:17.470 --> 06:18.828
Well...

06:30.850 --> 06:35.169
Sorry. It started recording before
I had a chance to place the camera.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.831
Maybe I should stop
and start over again.

06:38.990 --> 06:42.249
Or you can just cut this part out.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.089
This is recording, right?

06:47.309 --> 06:50.137
Personal introduction.

06:53.050 --> 06:55.379
Hi, there. I'm Nick Chambers

06:55.479 --> 06:59.569
and I'm the webmaster
at jillgoddardcaught.com.

06:59.669 --> 07:04.570
You know, pictures of Jill,
scans, videos, articles.

07:04.670 --> 07:07.730
Some of my stuff is some
of the first posted of her.

07:07.830 --> 07:12.870
But that was just lucky. I'm not
a reporter. I don't work for an agency.

07:16.469 --> 07:17.599
Presentation of...

07:17.699 --> 07:20.282
I already talked about
my website. Sorry.

07:20.382 --> 07:22.370
What do I expect from...

07:25.240 --> 07:29.857
I'm really happy I won. I know a lot
of bloggers entered the contest.

07:35.370 --> 07:39.229
I've never been to Austin before.
It's really nice.

07:39.390 --> 07:42.782
Actually, I just checked in
the hotel a couple hours ago.

07:43.889 --> 07:46.643
I still can't believe I'm
going to meet Jill Goddard.

07:46.759 --> 07:51.122
I hope my interview with her works out.
I don't want to spoil her dinner.

07:52.430 --> 07:55.920
I promise I won't be as
nervous as I am right now.

07:57.236 --> 07:58.922
Thanks for everything.

08:02.010 --> 08:05.401
I'm surprised, honestly.
Have you shown us too much?

08:06.909 --> 08:08.719
OK, tell him that.

08:08.820 --> 08:12.639
Once you see this scene
in the final film,

08:12.749 --> 08:15.780
you'll see there's a lot more
to it than meets the eye.

08:16.070 --> 08:19.454
Oh, shit. It's a wet dream.
I knew it. I knew it...

08:19.559 --> 08:23.029
That's the exact moment when I wake
up from a dream... it is, isn't it?

08:23.129 --> 08:25.769
No, no, no, it's not a dream.
I assure you, it's not a dream.

08:25.869 --> 08:28.887
- I hate dreams in movies.
- Hate dreams in movies?

08:28.987 --> 08:31.169
What is that? Some thing
with European directors?

08:31.269 --> 08:34.179
- Hello? Nick Chambers?
- Yeah?

08:34.280 --> 08:35.938
Are you Nick Chambers?

08:36.039 --> 08:38.509
Are you the contest winner who gets
to have dinner with Jill Goddard?

08:38.609 --> 08:40.948
- That's me.
- I'm sorry to bother you.

08:41.849 --> 08:44.449
My name is Simon Chord.
I work for the official Dark Sky

08:44.549 --> 08:46.025
- website and...
- Yeah.

08:46.150 --> 08:50.089
I'm sorry, but did you just
try to send us a video?

08:50.189 --> 08:51.629
Yeah. Just now.

08:51.729 --> 08:55.330
I'm sorry. I clicked record before I
had a chance to position the camera.

08:55.430 --> 08:58.952
- Oh, that's OK.
- And I mixed two questions into one.

08:59.052 --> 09:03.640
That's OK. By the way,
where are you right now?

09:03.740 --> 09:05.240
I'm here, at the hotel.

09:05.340 --> 09:08.839
But the convention is
happening right now.

09:08.939 --> 09:12.749
- I know. I'm watching it.
- Aren't you at your hotel?

09:12.849 --> 09:15.679
I'm watching it on my laptop.
They're streaming it from the website.

09:15.779 --> 09:18.990
You mean they didn't
invite you to the event?

09:19.090 --> 09:21.719
- Yeah?
- Nobody has contacted you?

09:21.819 --> 09:26.773
The producers of the gala didn't call
you to say the contest was cancelled?

09:27.130 --> 09:30.953
What? No, I thought I was
supposed to wait here.

09:32.790 --> 09:35.252
- Cancelled?
- One second.

09:36.029 --> 09:38.180
I think we have another question.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.829
Yeah! Back there?

09:40.639 --> 09:44.409
OK, so, hi, Jill. Just wanted to say this
latest part of the saga looks great.

09:44.509 --> 09:48.581
Can't wait to see it. So, this is your
third movie with Dave and the first one

09:48.681 --> 09:51.272
you've made together now that
you're officially a couple in real life.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.060
Did it make a big difference
working together this time?

09:54.160 --> 09:57.119
Well, there was a lot
less sneaking around.

09:57.929 --> 10:01.199
- I've got a question for Richie.
- Nick, can you hear me?

10:01.299 --> 10:02.493
Yeah.

10:02.593 --> 10:06.144
I'm sorry, Nick.
There's nothing I can do.

10:07.270 --> 10:10.708
What happened? You mean I came
all the way out here for nothing?

10:10.810 --> 10:15.563
I don't know, Nick. Let's just
sit tight. I left them a message.

10:17.369 --> 10:20.802
- Man, this breaks my heart.
- But this doesn't make any sense.

10:20.909 --> 10:24.403
They just sent me an e-mail asking
me to record a greeting for you.

10:25.330 --> 10:28.356
What the hell is she staring at?

10:28.849 --> 10:29.949
What? Who?

10:30.050 --> 10:34.930
She's looking at her bag the whole time.
What, is she afraid her coke will fly out?

10:35.030 --> 10:37.312
What? What are you talking about?

10:37.599 --> 10:41.417
- Sorry, hold on a second.
- Last question of the night.

10:43.110 --> 10:47.896
First of all, congratulations for the
performance. I'm a big fan of the saga.

10:48.080 --> 10:52.810
Jill, I wanted to ask you about these
recent rumors, about a leaked video.

10:52.910 --> 10:56.050
I was not in any homemade
porn video that got stolen.

10:56.150 --> 10:59.344
That's right. I've got it here.
You have to pay.

11:03.269 --> 11:05.205
Come on, Richie. The movie's good.

11:05.305 --> 11:07.060
It's funny. You don't
need to make up a story

11:07.160 --> 11:10.322
about me appearing in a porn movie
to get people talking about it.

11:11.090 --> 11:15.636
Wait, wait, Jill. Are you saying
the producers started the rumor?

11:15.769 --> 11:18.640
- Hey, Nick.
- I made a joke with myself...

11:19.980 --> 11:21.907
But don't worry. Don't worry.

11:22.410 --> 11:26.721
Drag this link into the
Dark Sky website.

11:32.519 --> 11:33.689
What's this?

11:33.789 --> 11:36.659
It's a surveillance
camera in the theater.

11:36.759 --> 11:39.130
I can control it from here.

11:39.230 --> 11:41.831
I can zoom it.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.799
I can move it.

11:48.930 --> 11:50.552
Her cell phone.

11:50.669 --> 11:54.147
- The model is perfect.
- What for?

11:55.909 --> 12:00.166
Can't you take a photo?
We have the best view in the house.

12:00.909 --> 12:04.838
- What are you talking about?
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

12:04.949 --> 12:08.259
I've seen better cleavage,
but it'll look great on your website.

12:08.390 --> 12:12.720
She's never shown her tits before.
For us, that's the final frontier.

12:12.830 --> 12:15.729
Where are you calling from?
Where are you doing all this?

12:15.829 --> 12:19.355
Hold on. Hold on.

12:20.649 --> 12:24.789
There, all set. Click on there.

12:32.709 --> 12:35.019
Of course you were
trained up in Europe

12:35.119 --> 12:38.190
but you've been mainly making
movies for Americans lately.

12:38.290 --> 12:42.343
What is the difference between American
audiences and European audiences?

12:44.030 --> 12:45.693
What is this?

12:48.559 --> 12:49.819
Chord, are you there?

12:53.000 --> 12:57.139
Shut up! Turn off the volume of
the window or she'll hear us!

13:01.340 --> 13:05.110
Sorry. I forgot this program
boots with the mike open.

13:05.210 --> 13:10.090
- So, this is... this is...
- It's her phone.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.920
You can look at anything you want.

13:12.020 --> 13:16.220
Her messages, her pics,
her schedule, her contacts.

13:16.320 --> 13:20.360
Don't worry, there's no way
we can get caught doing this.

13:20.460 --> 13:23.616
She thinks her camera
is off right now.

13:24.230 --> 13:26.469
Why did you give this to me?

13:26.669 --> 13:29.129
Can you keep a secret?

13:30.509 --> 13:31.870
Yeah.

13:31.970 --> 13:35.799
She's the one who canceled
the dinner for no reason.

13:38.579 --> 13:41.032
All right, OK, OK,
we could go on for hours.

13:41.180 --> 13:45.350
Tomorrow somebody from the distributor
will make up some pretty excuse,

13:45.450 --> 13:48.282
like they always do when
she acts like a fucking bitch.

13:49.460 --> 13:52.929
- You mean she cancelled the dinner?
- Yeah. A little while ago.

13:53.030 --> 13:57.829
I can't believe it! I came all
this way and nobody told me.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.129
You can see who she's calling.

14:05.869 --> 14:07.679
Tony Hillman.

14:07.779 --> 14:12.266
I think that's her...
Yeah, that's her agent.

14:12.709 --> 14:14.350
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:14.450 --> 14:18.050
I'm sorry I couldn't pick up.
It just finished. I'm coming straight over.

14:18.150 --> 14:20.519
I didn't know what time the
cocktail party was over.

14:20.619 --> 14:22.559
- It's just starting.
- You're not staying?

14:22.659 --> 14:24.459
I thought it was on your schedule!

14:24.559 --> 14:27.109
I rushed out of there so
I could come and see you

14:27.209 --> 14:29.799
without having to
justify myself to anyone.

14:29.899 --> 14:34.140
Now I have to justify myself to you? I only
have a couple hours I can spend with you.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.424
- I'm sorry, damn it.
- You know that.

14:37.270 --> 14:38.810
I've been waiting all day to see you.

14:38.910 --> 14:42.180
Holy shit! That son of a bitch
booked a hotel room a month ago

14:42.280 --> 14:44.349
and flew all the way over here.
What a bastard.

14:44.449 --> 14:48.420
She's going to see him?
You mean, they're going to...?

14:48.520 --> 14:51.250
I can't believe it! Looks like
you'll be going back to L.A.

14:51.350 --> 14:54.555
with a much better souvenir
than dinner with that bimbo.

14:54.859 --> 14:57.729
Outside the theater,
on my way to the limo.

14:57.829 --> 14:59.729
You know where the Grand
Wells Hotel is, right?

14:59.829 --> 15:03.473
- I'll ask the driver. I think it's nearby.
- OK. I'll be waiting in the room.

15:03.573 --> 15:05.573
- See you in a flash.
- See you.

15:06.699 --> 15:09.370
Did she just say the Grand Wells?

15:09.470 --> 15:11.269
What's wrong?

15:12.250 --> 15:14.709
That's where I'm staying.

15:15.010 --> 15:17.950
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

15:18.180 --> 15:22.715
Hold on, wait a second.
What room are you in?

15:24.890 --> 15:26.990
Room 700.

15:27.489 --> 15:28.920
Why?

15:29.020 --> 15:32.678
- 700.
- Why?

15:33.430 --> 15:36.809
You taped the greeting with
a video camera, right?

15:36.909 --> 15:38.970
Yeah, I have one.

15:40.829 --> 15:42.140
They gave this to me in reception.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.010
- Good.
- Why?

15:44.110 --> 15:47.378
Wait, Nick. It's a video call.

15:53.029 --> 15:54.519
Jill, where are you?

15:54.619 --> 15:57.659
Hi. I'm going straight
back to the rental.

15:58.320 --> 16:01.820
- I talked to Richie. He's pissed.
- Yeah, well, so am I.

16:02.120 --> 16:05.260
- Not the same thing, Jill.
- They should have consulted me first.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.290
- Why didn't they? Were they too ashamed?
- Jill, please.

16:08.390 --> 16:10.830
"Jill, do you mind if we say"
you got caught masturbating

16:10.930 --> 16:13.248
- for your boyfriend on a webcam?"
- Give me a fucking break.

16:13.348 --> 16:16.769
- Rumors get thrown out there all the time.
- They're talking about it everywhere!

16:16.869 --> 16:19.409
It's the best rumor I've ever heard
and it's probably got its own

16:19.509 --> 16:23.111
- team of publicists spreading it.
- Jill, I don't give a fuck about that!

16:23.949 --> 16:27.129
- Should I click on this, Chord?
- Sure.

16:27.229 --> 16:29.519
...convention, and screw
up your schedule?

16:29.619 --> 16:32.990
You know what all those people you
stood up will think? You do, right?

16:33.090 --> 16:35.450
I bet people are saying they
saw you in the bathroom,

16:35.820 --> 16:38.229
- I bet people...
- Is that what you're worried about?

16:38.329 --> 16:42.229
Nobody saw me doing any drugs
because I didn't do any drugs.

16:42.329 --> 16:47.099
Yeah, right, bitch. Get the
camera closer to the window.

16:50.027 --> 16:51.009
Yeah.

16:51.110 --> 16:53.040
- I don't want to.
- I know you don't.

16:53.140 --> 16:58.220
No, I... I mean I don't
want to renegotiate.

16:58.910 --> 17:02.919
- What are you talking about?
- I can't do this anymore.

17:03.450 --> 17:06.229
Aim at the other
wing of the building.

17:10.529 --> 17:11.757
What?

17:13.180 --> 17:14.509
Perfect.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.473
You can do that?

17:16.939 --> 17:18.609
Wait a second.

17:19.598 --> 17:21.510
How is that possible?

17:22.839 --> 17:25.160
Room 686.

17:25.609 --> 17:28.679
OK? You'll feel better tomorrow.

17:28.779 --> 17:31.439
I didn't just decide this.

17:32.180 --> 17:35.249
It's been bugging me for a while now.

17:36.620 --> 17:40.250
It's been bugging you for a while now
and you didn't even say anything?

17:40.350 --> 17:42.289
I've got another call, Dave.
We'll talk tomorrow.

17:42.389 --> 17:44.759
No, Jill, Jill, Jill?

17:47.150 --> 17:48.655
- It's me, Jill.
- Hello?

17:48.770 --> 17:51.999
It's nothing. Reception just called.
There's a problem with the room.

17:52.099 --> 17:54.069
- What are we gonna do?
- A leak or something.

17:54.169 --> 17:57.510
They gave me another room.
Room 686. I'm on my way over now.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.430
- OK, I'm almost there.
- See you soon.

18:02.350 --> 18:04.950
Don't worry. Turn the lights off.

18:05.050 --> 18:08.219
They won't see you with your lights off,
especially if they're fucking,

18:08.319 --> 18:11.079
which is what it sounds
like they'll be doing.

18:11.280 --> 18:15.249
What? Chord, wait.
I'm not going to...

18:19.290 --> 18:20.839
What is this?

18:20.959 --> 18:22.689
What's what?

18:23.099 --> 18:24.499
What is this?

18:24.599 --> 18:28.454
- What are you talking about?
- Another window just opened up.

18:28.569 --> 18:30.939
- No, it didn't.
- What do you mean?

18:31.039 --> 18:32.909
Wait a second.

18:37.280 --> 18:41.402
It's him. It's Tony. Turn off
the lights or we're fucked.

18:42.849 --> 18:45.640
Shit, Chord. I'm done with this.

18:45.749 --> 18:49.720
Don't worry, Nick.
Just give me a second.

18:51.659 --> 18:57.029
OK, Nick. I have a
ton of work tonight.

18:57.129 --> 18:59.900
- I'm signing out.
- You're leaving?

19:00.000 --> 19:02.749
I'll still be here connected.
Call me anytime.

19:02.849 --> 19:05.070
- But...
- You can turn off the camera,

19:05.170 --> 19:08.010
you can turn off the computer,
do whatever you want.

19:08.110 --> 19:12.609
But remember, it's her fault
you're stranded at that hotel.

19:12.709 --> 19:14.920
I think it's only fair
she should offer you

19:15.020 --> 19:17.590
a little entertainment
in the meantime.

19:19.849 --> 19:23.489
- Hold on a second. I...
- You're a nice guy, Nick.

19:23.589 --> 19:27.499
She's the one who goes around
screwing over guys like you.

19:27.599 --> 19:32.010
I'm just getting even.
See you soon, Nick.

19:55.490 --> 19:56.560
Hello.

19:57.460 --> 19:58.429
Hello?

19:58.529 --> 20:02.900
First of all, we want to assure you that
nobody can detect or trace this line.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.788
It's personalized software we
recently created ourselves. So...

20:06.888 --> 20:10.199
if you want to talk to us,
you are completely safe.

20:13.369 --> 20:14.447
Well?

20:14.740 --> 20:17.249
Well, what? What do you want?

20:17.850 --> 20:20.577
We want to work for you, Nevada.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.355
What? What did you just call me?

20:25.550 --> 20:26.770
Nevada.

20:39.999 --> 20:41.593
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.459
- How are you?
- Good. Listen.

20:46.559 --> 20:48.469
You look great.

21:04.909 --> 21:06.480
What's wrong?

21:06.730 --> 21:10.369
Dave called me right after you hung up.
Imagine how scared I was.

21:10.469 --> 21:14.607
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, yeah. But don't worry.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.159
You know, he thinks I'm in L.A.

21:19.730 --> 21:23.160
- I didn't think he'd call you.
- Well, I'm your agent.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.790
Who else would he call?

21:29.270 --> 21:32.390
- Want some?
- No, I don't.

21:34.020 --> 21:36.509
You don't have to worry about Dave.

21:38.439 --> 21:40.590
I managed to calm him down.

21:42.499 --> 21:45.710
I've become an expert
at calming down actors.

21:47.150 --> 21:48.980
What did you tell him?

21:49.589 --> 21:51.439
That you're OK,

21:51.639 --> 21:54.970
a little stressed,
that it'll go away.

21:55.280 --> 21:59.349
That you weren't serious about not wanting
to renegotiate, that you're upset...

21:59.449 --> 22:01.820
You know I've been thinking
about it for months.

22:01.920 --> 22:06.239
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know,
I know, I know, but...

22:06.390 --> 22:10.490
but you weren't serious
about it. OK? All right.

22:11.799 --> 22:14.929
OK. You have to wait
until the timing is better.

22:15.029 --> 22:19.199
And you know Dave, he likes to
think that he's all up to date,

22:19.299 --> 22:20.899
and if you suddenly tell
him something like that,

22:20.999 --> 22:22.899
- he'll just go...
- I want to break up with him.

22:22.999 --> 22:24.939
What?

22:27.420 --> 22:29.089
Hey.

22:32.029 --> 22:35.430
We've been over this
a thousand times, Jill.

22:37.310 --> 22:42.685
It's too soon. OK?
Why can't you trust me on this?

22:44.629 --> 22:48.925
Maybe because you're such an
expert at calming down actors.

22:52.669 --> 22:56.129
OK, I'm going to order
something for dinner.

22:56.900 --> 22:59.540
Just think about it, OK?

23:28.689 --> 23:32.349
Jill? Jill, where are you going?

24:04.499 --> 24:05.695
Shit!

24:22.459 --> 24:25.359
- Nick?
- Chord, he's looking up here.

24:25.459 --> 24:27.699
The lights suddenly turned on
and then he saw the camera.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.900
Who?

24:29.000 --> 24:32.630
Jill's agent. Jill left but he's still
in there and he's looking up here.

24:32.730 --> 24:36.199
I dropped the camera. I can't see him.
I don't know what he's doing.

24:36.299 --> 24:39.670
He's left the room and he's
calling reception. We can hear it.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.479
- Let me check...
- Shit!

24:41.579 --> 24:43.196
Shut up.

24:44.080 --> 24:48.549
- Reception. Can I help you?
- Hi. I'm in room 686.

24:48.649 --> 24:51.649
I want to know what room
is right across from mine.

24:51.750 --> 24:53.549
One floor up. At the end of the hall.

24:53.649 --> 24:57.529
Oh, that's room 700.
It's not occupied.

24:57.630 --> 25:01.030
- Is there a reason you're asking?
- What? It's not occupied?

25:01.130 --> 25:03.358
If you'd like to take a look,
I can order a card key

25:03.528 --> 25:05.353
- from the main office.
- Shit!

25:06.771 --> 25:09.571
OK, thanks. I'm on my way.

25:09.671 --> 25:12.153
Great. Thanks for calling.

25:19.421 --> 25:20.881
What the...

25:20.981 --> 25:23.080
The main office.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.691
The first floor.

25:25.791 --> 25:29.311
It must be... there it is.

25:31.101 --> 25:32.711
He's coming this way.
I have to get out of here.

25:32.811 --> 25:35.700
You can't leave your laptop and
your video camera in there.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.670
- I'll bring them with me.
- There isn't time, Nick.

25:37.770 --> 25:41.530
He'll be there before you reach
the door. Do as I say, OK?

25:42.511 --> 25:45.510
Do as I say and
everything will be fine.

25:51.011 --> 25:54.580
Put your stuff under the bed
where the arrow's pointing.

25:55.510 --> 25:58.530
The video camera and that suitcase.

25:58.991 --> 26:02.790
- Everything but your laptop.
- Under the bed?

26:03.681 --> 26:05.330
Do it.

26:25.910 --> 26:27.141
In there.

26:27.620 --> 26:31.820
- What's in there?
- There's a bag. Open it. Hurry!

26:36.420 --> 26:40.970
See the two metal teeth?
The taser has a switch on the base.

26:41.940 --> 26:43.800
It's very simple.

26:44.430 --> 26:48.340
When the guy walks into the room,
you zap him with it from behind.

26:48.440 --> 26:53.540
He won't even see you. When he wakes up,
he'll be in an empty room, that's all.

26:53.870 --> 26:57.510
- I don't...
- Either that or you'll have to face him.

26:57.610 --> 27:01.980
No offense, but he looks like more
than you can handle. It's your call.

27:27.011 --> 27:28.471
Hello?

27:34.980 --> 27:36.350
Hello!

27:38.761 --> 27:40.451
What the...?

27:44.230 --> 27:47.970
Shit, shit. Shit!

27:48.410 --> 27:50.830
Quick, move that nightstand.

27:59.101 --> 28:00.770
What is this?

28:01.031 --> 28:04.181
The gag is for his mouth and the
cuffs on the wall are for his hands.

28:04.281 --> 28:05.610
- What?
- He didn't see your face

28:05.710 --> 28:08.618
and I erased you from the
hotel registry. You're clean.

28:08.718 --> 28:11.762
But you still need to get the hell out
of there before he sounds the alarm.

28:11.862 --> 28:15.921
This way we can make sure he stays quiet
but doesn't go anywhere when he wakes up.

28:16.021 --> 28:18.891
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- We don't know how long he'll be out.

28:18.991 --> 28:22.110
What will you do if he comes to and
you're still there? Zap him again?

28:22.210 --> 28:25.650
You know how dangerous
that would be? Do it for him, Nick.

28:26.920 --> 28:29.041
- What if I just leave?
- I can only get you out of this

28:29.141 --> 28:33.910
if you do everything I say. If you're
not going to, I'll sign out right now.

28:36.461 --> 28:39.210
- OK, see ya!
- No, no, no!

28:39.510 --> 28:41.810
Tie him up. Now.

28:57.700 --> 29:01.280
All this stuff...
you put it here. Why?

29:01.880 --> 29:05.791
Hurry up. Grab your laptop
and get out of there.

29:09.841 --> 29:11.480
What about my stuff?

29:13.901 --> 29:17.780
Come on, Nick, grab your
laptop and get out of there.

29:20.990 --> 29:25.129
Don't shut it, you idiot! I need to
guide you so nobody will see you.

29:25.229 --> 29:27.801
Keep it on. You have enough battery.

29:27.901 --> 29:31.150
The hallway is empty.
Go outside and turn right.

29:33.551 --> 29:37.670
There's a service elevator at the end
of the hall. I'll send it to your floor.

29:37.770 --> 29:39.360
You have a rental car
in the garage, right?

29:39.460 --> 29:42.040
- Yeah.
- No, wait!

29:42.440 --> 29:46.350
If you stay there they'll both see you.
You can't let anyone see you.

29:46.450 --> 29:48.320
- What do I do?
- They're headed right for you.

29:48.420 --> 29:53.321
The door on your left. Room 704.
I just opened it. Don't make any noise.

29:58.761 --> 30:01.361
Stay still. You're not alone.

30:05.321 --> 30:06.560
Hello?

30:07.130 --> 30:10.971
Good evening, sir.
Can I ask you for something?

30:11.071 --> 30:12.740
We're doing an equipment check.

30:12.841 --> 30:15.380
Would you mind turning up
the volume on your television?

30:15.480 --> 30:17.181
Oh, sure.

30:18.990 --> 30:21.011
Thank you very much.

30:21.111 --> 30:23.520
Leave the room. Now.

30:29.670 --> 30:33.290
Great. The elevator's right there.
Take it to the garage.

30:34.680 --> 30:37.400
That was you! The guy from reception?

30:37.500 --> 30:41.031
- It sounded just like the other voice.
- I'm pretty good at impersonations.

30:41.131 --> 30:44.440
Hurry up. There's no time to lose.
There's nobody on that floor right now.

30:44.540 --> 30:47.770
- We can do this, Nick. Hurry.
- Are you sure no one has seen me?

31:06.831 --> 31:08.483
So...

31:09.183 --> 31:12.044
all that stuff in my room,
the cameras...

31:12.144 --> 31:15.171
Don't worry. They're totally secure,
completely untraceable.

31:15.471 --> 31:17.640
Nobody will know you were there.

31:22.640 --> 31:27.111
That means...
you've already been in my room.

31:27.610 --> 31:31.450
If I'd told you I prepped the room
just in case, you'd have freaked out.

31:33.540 --> 31:35.381
Where are you right now?

31:36.385 --> 31:40.261
- Where are you talking to me?
- OK, you made it.

31:40.990 --> 31:43.521
We got lucky. The garage is empty.

31:46.370 --> 31:49.400
- Who are you?
- Quick. Quickly, get in the car.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.271
Our luck won't last.

31:54.941 --> 31:57.610
You're forgetting
the computer, damn it!

32:07.180 --> 32:09.321
Sorry, I must have left that on.

32:14.081 --> 32:15.281
You were in this car?

32:15.381 --> 32:18.960
That's right.
Open the glove compartment.

32:37.821 --> 32:41.130
Stick it on your dashboard
facing the road.

32:44.061 --> 32:47.861
No, I'm not hiding in the back seat.
Hurry up, damn it!

32:47.961 --> 32:51.930
Where are you?
Where are you watching me from?

32:52.030 --> 32:53.600
Do it.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.811
Why? What for?

32:58.911 --> 33:02.240
Put the camera on the dashboard.

33:02.340 --> 33:06.544
What for? Why are
you doing this to me?

33:06.680 --> 33:09.650
I want to see you. Show yourself!

33:13.790 --> 33:17.320
It's just as easy for me to
show this to the police, Nick.

33:17.420 --> 33:19.690
All I have to do is press a button.

33:24.931 --> 33:27.571
I'll explain it to them.
I'll tell them...

33:27.671 --> 33:31.410
They won't even ask you,
shit for brains.

33:31.510 --> 33:35.440
- They already know who you are.
- Hi, there. I'm Nick Chambers

33:35.540 --> 33:37.380
and I'm the webmaster...

33:37.480 --> 33:41.051
They'll have seen you explaining
how you won a blog contest,

33:41.151 --> 33:44.220
which nobody ever authorized.

33:44.320 --> 33:47.390
A blog contest which
all of a sudden...

33:47.490 --> 33:50.181
Poof! Just disappears.

33:51.750 --> 33:54.162
How long have you
been doing this to me?

33:56.220 --> 33:58.630
It's up to you, Nick.

34:09.944 --> 34:11.310
Where to?

34:11.411 --> 34:14.810
I gave you an arrow.
Follow the arrow.

34:14.909 --> 34:17.290
- Where are we going?
- Drive!

34:55.321 --> 34:59.062
Nick... turn off that
awful music, will you?

35:02.900 --> 35:07.170
- You're the one who left it on.
- I'm sorry, the CD has me curious.

35:07.270 --> 35:11.190
It's not exactly your style of music.
Actually, I know your tastes.

35:11.310 --> 35:14.111
You hate crap like
that as much as I do.

35:15.490 --> 35:19.131
Are you sure the CD is yours?

35:22.720 --> 35:24.820
If you'll excuse me,
I need to go for a second.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.990
Keep driving. I'll be right back.

35:45.170 --> 35:46.871
Excuse me, Nevada.

35:47.571 --> 35:49.851
What is this? Why are
you calling me Nevada?

35:49.951 --> 35:53.090
We've seen each other before.
We met on April.

35:53.190 --> 35:54.990
What? I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:55.090 --> 35:57.310
We know the rule. If a hacker
wants to work for you,

35:57.410 --> 35:59.891
he has to prove himself
by hacking you first.

35:59.991 --> 36:04.930
This is what we did, on April.
We uploaded a greeting onto your system.

36:05.330 --> 36:09.811
Then, later that day,
you called us back.

36:10.551 --> 36:12.131
Here's the video file.

36:18.641 --> 36:22.190
What makes you think you
can contact me like this?

36:22.951 --> 36:24.577
Hi...

36:26.356 --> 36:30.471
- Nevada? Are you Nevada?
- Yes, I am.

36:31.831 --> 36:35.511
At first we thought it was strange
of you to cut us off like that.

36:35.611 --> 36:39.410
If you wanted to meet us,
why cut us off?

36:39.510 --> 36:42.431
Then we figured you thought
the connection might be unsafe.

36:42.531 --> 36:44.970
So, we've been reinforcing it.

36:45.070 --> 36:49.190
Wait, wait, wait. I'm not Nevada!

36:57.240 --> 37:01.242
That's right. If you show your face,

37:01.742 --> 37:03.881
we show ours.

37:10.391 --> 37:15.500
My name is Pierre Da Rocha, Triop 1.
This is our base in Paris.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.100
Nick? Who's talking?

37:18.401 --> 37:20.230
Did you hear a voice?

37:21.590 --> 37:23.127
It was...

37:23.770 --> 37:27.951
- the radio.
- I don't see any radio on your computer.

37:29.290 --> 37:30.990
The car radio.

37:32.091 --> 37:35.631
You're almost there.
Wait for me when you get there.

37:37.751 --> 37:40.214
Excuse me, Nevada, sorry.

37:40.971 --> 37:43.751
You are in the middle
of an operation.

37:44.180 --> 37:46.410
That's not your real face,
it's make-up, right?

37:46.510 --> 37:47.730
What?

37:47.831 --> 37:51.770
We understand,
this is not the best time.

37:51.870 --> 37:57.012
We are going to leave an open window
for you to talk to us, whenever you want.

37:57.801 --> 38:03.280
Remember... you are the best...
but we are close second.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.980
Remember the trick I
played on Jill's cell phone?

38:40.080 --> 38:43.320
Well, it's even easier to
do it with her computer.

38:47.720 --> 38:50.220
She's in the apartment
they rent for her.

38:50.321 --> 38:53.831
She has no idea her webcam is on.

38:56.300 --> 39:00.830
- What's that?
- Her computer. From inside.

39:01.430 --> 39:04.859
I uploaded a file to your desktop.
The red rectangle...

39:04.959 --> 39:08.341
I want you to drag it to her windows.
Upper right corner.

39:08.441 --> 39:13.181
It will open automatically on
her computer. Do it right now.

39:17.420 --> 39:18.850
What is it?

39:19.050 --> 39:22.290
When it opens on hers,
it'll open on yours as well.

39:22.390 --> 39:24.660
You'll be able to see everything.

39:24.860 --> 39:27.690
- What is it?
- Do it.

39:35.770 --> 39:37.710
Chord? What is this?

39:39.210 --> 39:42.640
Is that you? What are you doing?

39:45.511 --> 39:47.011
What is this?

39:48.611 --> 39:52.046
You're the one who wanted
to see me so badly.

39:54.190 --> 39:58.930
Listen to me, Nick.
Right now you've two options.

39:59.030 --> 40:03.931
Either drag that message
for Jill to her computer

40:04.861 --> 40:06.399
or...

40:06.599 --> 40:10.361
I'll give it to her personally.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.680
Hello?

40:49.980 --> 40:53.381
Chord, wait! No!
What are you doing?

40:53.481 --> 40:58.591
It's up to you, Nick. Send her the
file or I'll go upstairs after her.

40:58.691 --> 41:00.791
Wait, wait! I'll do it!

41:06.190 --> 41:08.991
Shit! What the fuck is this?

41:17.501 --> 41:19.510
- Jill!
- Hi.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.910
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

41:22.010 --> 41:25.980
- You don't look so good.
- Why? Did you watch the presentation?

41:26.080 --> 41:28.920
No. I mean now. You look pissed.

41:30.400 --> 41:35.110
No, sorry. I just heard something
fall downstairs and I got scared.

41:35.851 --> 41:37.911
OK, Nick, wait until
they're done talking.

41:38.031 --> 41:39.911
Send the message as soon
as her friend hangs up.

41:40.011 --> 41:44.100
- OK. But tell me...
- I'll be back in a while.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.631
Hello? Chord?

41:48.150 --> 41:51.990
- It's impossible for me to reach you.
- You're talking to me right now.

41:52.991 --> 41:54.910
Tony called earlier.

41:56.051 --> 41:57.736
Carol, I...

41:58.336 --> 42:01.310
I'm going to sign off.
I want to go to bed.

42:01.410 --> 42:04.150
He said you and Dave
had another fight.

42:04.250 --> 42:06.370
Tony is worried about
your relationship.

42:06.470 --> 42:09.230
He thinks you should spend
more time together.

42:11.391 --> 42:13.290
So, Tony's worried.

42:13.390 --> 42:16.430
Yes. He said your...

42:16.830 --> 42:17.730
Nevada?!

42:17.830 --> 42:20.031
Can you get inside my computer
and see everything I see?

42:21.230 --> 42:22.591
Do it now.

42:24.791 --> 42:26.470
He's trying to help you, Jill.

42:26.570 --> 42:29.790
There's a man hiding in her house.
He's watching everything I do.

42:30.031 --> 42:32.850
He's hiding in her house.
She doesn't know. She's in danger.

42:33.250 --> 42:35.650
Have you got a ping-pong camera?

42:36.150 --> 42:38.650
- We can use it to geolocate you.
- What?

42:39.150 --> 42:41.721
OK, it is you.
It's on your dashboard.

42:41.821 --> 42:44.761
- Those cameras are awesome, Nevada.
- Forget about me.

42:44.861 --> 42:47.461
She's the one that matters.
She's the one in danger, damn it!

42:47.561 --> 42:50.930
It's a critical moment in your career.
You can't blow this.

42:51.990 --> 42:55.251
The media is just waiting
for you to fuck up again.

42:56.211 --> 42:58.011
You might think that
they've pardoned you

42:58.111 --> 43:02.011
because they've been off your
back for a while. But they haven't.

43:02.690 --> 43:06.111
If you announce that you're retiring now,
you'll be crucified. You know that.

43:06.411 --> 43:11.050
And if you change your mind and try to make
a comeback, you'll be a laughing stock.

43:11.150 --> 43:14.720
Seriously, is there anything I can
do to help? Anything you need?

43:14.820 --> 43:17.761
- Yeah.
- What?

43:30.571 --> 43:31.825
Well, Nick.

43:35.710 --> 43:37.881
What are you waiting for?

43:39.230 --> 43:40.951
Send it to her.

43:41.111 --> 43:44.020
Tell me what it is. As soon as
you tell me, I'll send it to her.

43:44.121 --> 43:46.690
Shit, Nick.

43:47.090 --> 43:49.320
We've already had this conversation.

43:49.421 --> 43:54.498
Even an idiot like you can figure
out that if I wanted to hurt her,

43:54.598 --> 43:58.835
I already would have.
I don't want to,

43:58.935 --> 44:02.700
but I will if you force me to.

44:04.390 --> 44:07.210
OK! I'll send it, I'll send it!

44:08.111 --> 44:09.471
Good.

44:09.910 --> 44:12.480
That wasn't so hard now, was it?

44:36.880 --> 44:39.341
Jesus Christ. No.

44:42.781 --> 44:44.810
Chord! Jesus, Chord!

44:46.080 --> 44:48.551
If she puts down the phone,
I'll turn off the juice.

44:48.651 --> 44:51.150
Tell her. Write it
in the text window.

45:02.701 --> 45:06.869
If she picks it up, Tony's mouth
will never be the same again.

45:09.871 --> 45:11.844
Tell her to stay put.

45:21.110 --> 45:24.471
- Can you see me?
- Tell her, damn it!

45:29.360 --> 45:31.821
OK, Nick.

45:31.921 --> 45:34.651
You can take it from here.

45:34.851 --> 45:36.630
Go ahead.

45:39.571 --> 45:41.971
Where... where's Tony?

45:42.851 --> 45:44.030
What do you want from me?

45:44.130 --> 45:47.811
- Tell her, Nick.
- Tell her what?

45:48.041 --> 45:50.341
What you want from her.

45:50.841 --> 45:54.710
- I don't want anything.
- She'll do anything you ask, Nick.

45:55.010 --> 45:58.420
- I don't want anything.
- Like at the hotel, right?

45:58.521 --> 46:00.291
You're a fraud.

46:00.391 --> 46:02.260
Stop! Please, stop!

46:04.420 --> 46:08.461
Chord, wait! OK, OK, OK!

46:22.611 --> 46:26.581
Good. See how easy this is?

46:26.681 --> 46:29.250
It's all in your head.

46:29.350 --> 46:31.821
It's already there.

46:38.260 --> 46:40.260
- OK, now let Tony go.
- Sorry.

46:41.060 --> 46:43.656
- Stop!
- I don't know what else to say.

46:43.756 --> 46:46.571
- No!
- OK, OK!

46:46.671 --> 46:48.370
Stop!

47:00.425 --> 47:04.435
- Good! Jesus Christ!
- Like this?

47:06.370 --> 47:08.611
Are you kidding me?

47:09.111 --> 47:11.591
OK, wait, wait!

47:14.530 --> 47:17.525
Yes, wider, of course.

47:19.190 --> 47:21.961
Before now you had to
settle for those lame photos

47:22.061 --> 47:24.910
you had on your filthy website.

47:25.570 --> 47:29.630
You're finally going beyond
the final frontier?

47:29.770 --> 47:31.190
Like this?

47:33.207 --> 47:35.484
- What do you want?
- OK.

47:35.584 --> 47:39.330
- What do you want?
- Chord, let me think, god damn it!

47:39.430 --> 47:41.761
What's there to think about?

47:45.491 --> 47:48.331
Oh, this is good stuff.

47:48.931 --> 47:53.571
Better than those pics of Jill where
you can barely see her panties.

47:53.890 --> 47:57.550
You like that stuff but it's
kind of a tease, isn't it?

47:57.650 --> 48:00.566
- Listen, I have an idea, OK?
- Come on.

48:00.666 --> 48:04.950
Tell me where you are and I can come
over there. I'll do anything you say, OK?

48:07.071 --> 48:10.470
Hold on. We're failing at something
pretty basic here, Nick.

48:10.570 --> 48:13.090
That bitter look on
her face has to go.

48:19.590 --> 48:21.188
I understand.

48:21.760 --> 48:23.860
Can I wipe my face?

48:23.960 --> 48:27.030
Yes, she can. Of course she can.

48:43.821 --> 48:47.150
I can... I can come
over there like this.

48:47.250 --> 48:50.060
Cut the crap, Nick.
We're off course here.

48:50.160 --> 48:53.330
Her robe's closed again.
Tell her to open it, damn it.

48:53.430 --> 48:55.592
You don't want to see me in person?

49:04.850 --> 49:06.311
How's this?

49:06.771 --> 49:08.950
Fuck you, Nick.

49:09.810 --> 49:13.450
Tell me... tell me how you want it,
you fucking son of a bitch!

49:13.551 --> 49:15.620
Hey, hey! Look, look!
Now we're talking!

49:15.720 --> 49:19.070
Keep going, damn it!
Don't let her close the robe again.

49:23.370 --> 49:27.351
That's a good idea.
Let's see how it goes.

49:28.750 --> 49:31.671
I understand. Just...
just give me a second.

49:39.640 --> 49:42.040
You're heading in
the right direction.

49:42.140 --> 49:44.180
- Keep going.
- OK.

49:45.590 --> 49:48.511
- Chord?
- Keep going.

50:03.431 --> 50:08.070
Oh, yeah. Very nice.
That's what I'm talking about.

50:08.470 --> 50:12.711
- What's... Oh, shit. I can't believe it.
- What was that?

50:12.811 --> 50:16.240
She must have picked up
her cell with her left hand.

50:16.341 --> 50:18.991
- She's calling the cops!
- The cops?

50:19.091 --> 50:24.330
Don't worry, I blocked her signal earlier.
We're the only ones who can hear her.

50:24.731 --> 50:28.430
Smart girl, smart girl.

50:28.990 --> 50:31.431
OK, Nick, where were we?

50:32.770 --> 50:35.070
She's already doing great.

50:35.931 --> 50:39.708
Maybe a little more... more...

50:44.471 --> 50:49.031
Well, sometimes the simplest
things work the best.

50:50.971 --> 50:52.790
OK.

50:54.651 --> 50:57.870
OK, Nick. This is all I need.

51:02.661 --> 51:04.361
He cut the connection.

51:04.761 --> 51:07.130
He cut it? Are you sure?

51:07.330 --> 51:08.670
You're on your own.

51:11.831 --> 51:13.570
Jill, it's over! It's over!

51:15.931 --> 51:20.140
- Help! Please help! It's an emergency!
- It's OK! Everything's fine.

51:20.240 --> 51:24.010
Help is coming. Stay where you are.
Don't go anywhere.

51:36.220 --> 51:38.930
Jill! Jill, no!

51:42.490 --> 51:44.051
No!

51:45.251 --> 51:46.791
No!

51:55.240 --> 51:57.280
Nevada! Nevada!

51:57.381 --> 52:00.710
It's OK, listen. We're extracting the
information from the police server.

52:00.810 --> 52:03.266
The police? Damn!

52:03.366 --> 52:06.911
- Are they far away?
- They've already sent units to the house.

52:07.551 --> 52:09.931
Fuck. Fuck.

52:10.031 --> 52:13.371
What is he doing? What is that?

52:14.830 --> 52:16.751
I don't know.

52:18.211 --> 52:21.390
- What do the police know?
- They've got the situation under control.

52:21.490 --> 52:24.311
They know he's in there
and they know he's armed.

52:28.270 --> 52:29.421
OK.

52:30.221 --> 52:35.221
Don't worry. They're almost there.
They will arrive in half a minute or so.

52:35.621 --> 52:39.780
Oh, putain! Guys! Guys!
Look at this.

52:40.551 --> 52:41.890
What is that?

52:42.390 --> 52:45.360
It's the police. They have access
to these security cameras.

52:45.460 --> 52:47.531
What? There were cameras all
over the house the whole time?

52:47.631 --> 52:51.231
Find Jill! She has to
be there somewhere.

52:53.111 --> 52:56.111
There he is! Wearing a mask!
That's him.

52:57.100 --> 53:00.270
He's by a woodpile
on the first floor.

53:00.370 --> 53:02.790
- I don't see her anywhere.
- Keep looking.

53:02.890 --> 53:04.830
I only see him.

53:07.710 --> 53:09.471
They're here! They're here!

53:13.050 --> 53:16.290
Pierre, what exactly
did you tell them?

53:16.391 --> 53:20.130
- Do they know about the guy at the hotel?
- What? We didn't talk to them.

53:20.230 --> 53:22.500
What? You didn't call them?

53:22.601 --> 53:27.411
No! They were already on their
way when we spiked them.

53:27.811 --> 53:29.050
I thought you did!

53:29.551 --> 53:30.750
No.

53:32.040 --> 53:33.840
Who the fuck did?

53:34.611 --> 53:36.170
One second.

53:42.931 --> 53:44.951
Assault team,
we've got all the exits covered.

53:45.051 --> 53:47.580
Green light. Green light.

53:50.711 --> 53:53.630
It doesn't seem like the
subjects can hear us.

53:53.731 --> 53:55.461
What is he doing?

53:57.131 --> 53:58.590
Hold on. Wait!

53:58.690 --> 54:01.701
What looks like a hunting knife.
He's holding it up at eye level.

54:01.801 --> 54:03.430
Wait a minute.

54:06.171 --> 54:09.140
- He's picking something up.
- It's the same log.

54:09.707 --> 54:13.650
The subject is coming out. I repeat.
He's coming out. I repeat.

54:13.751 --> 54:16.481
He's in there. Now he's trapped.

54:30.530 --> 54:32.631
He's pointing the rod
right at you, guys.

54:34.931 --> 54:36.031
What the fuck?

54:36.131 --> 54:39.670
It's a trap! He set them up! He's been
toying with them this whole time.

54:39.771 --> 54:42.811
Chord isn't in there.
It's a recording.

54:46.811 --> 54:50.021
So, it's a video with time delay.

54:50.121 --> 54:53.045
- Then where is he?
- Shit.

54:53.745 --> 54:56.890
Where's her house? What's the address?
How do I get there?

55:03.310 --> 55:07.271
Fuck. I'm right down
the street! Fuck!

55:14.111 --> 55:17.340
Wait, wait, wait, listen, stop!

55:17.440 --> 55:18.816
Fuck.

55:19.651 --> 55:23.350
Nevada, there's a problem.
The police are putting out an APB.

55:23.450 --> 55:25.851
They've traced the signals from
the cameras in your apartment.

55:26.051 --> 55:29.360
- What did they find?
- The cameras pointed to your computer!

55:29.460 --> 55:31.991
They think it's you!
They know where you are!

55:36.101 --> 55:37.512
Oh, my God!

55:37.612 --> 55:41.331
All the cameras in the house are
ping-pong cameras like yours, Nevada.

55:41.431 --> 55:43.197
Who is this guy?

55:50.740 --> 55:52.119
Hello, Nick.

55:53.819 --> 55:54.744
Sorry, Nick.

55:54.844 --> 55:56.380
Chord, listen. Where are you?
Where's Jill?

55:56.480 --> 55:58.881
I need you for one more thing.

55:58.981 --> 56:02.791
I need you to keep everybody
distracted for a few minutes.

56:02.991 --> 56:07.690
Do that for me and
I'm afraid that's all.

56:14.271 --> 56:17.111
- It's time to say good-bye.
- Chord, wait.

56:18.391 --> 56:20.630
I want you to know one thing.

56:21.030 --> 56:24.341
I hope you feel guilty when you find
out what happened to Jill tonight.

56:24.441 --> 56:27.380
- Why? What's going to happen to her?
- Because it's your fault, too.

56:28.210 --> 56:29.251
Fuck!

56:30.651 --> 56:32.379
Chord? Chord?

56:32.479 --> 56:35.291
There he is! I've found him!

56:36.071 --> 56:39.710
He caused an accident.
It seems he ran away.

56:40.091 --> 56:41.770
He can't be far.

56:41.870 --> 56:43.714
- There!
- Where is he?

56:44.526 --> 56:48.190
Corner of West 24. Half a mile
away from the crashed van.

56:48.830 --> 56:51.550
- Where is that?
- Forget it, you're headed right for him!

56:53.850 --> 56:55.555
No, no, no, no!

56:57.330 --> 57:00.131
- Where are you going?
- How far away is he?

57:00.231 --> 57:01.551
Nevada!

57:01.771 --> 57:04.551
Shit! Sh... Shit!

57:06.970 --> 57:09.271
The road! They're blocking it!

57:09.571 --> 57:10.830
Fuck!

57:14.061 --> 57:16.041
Can you tell me where
he is right now?

57:16.530 --> 57:18.471
Nevada, here.

57:19.110 --> 57:22.710
Turn right on the next intersection.

57:23.211 --> 57:24.790
Where is he now?

57:25.370 --> 57:29.662
He's turning down West 12!
You'll see the accident any second now.

57:30.091 --> 57:32.131
You need to turn around.

57:32.231 --> 57:34.210
Why around it?
I can't stay behind him?

57:34.310 --> 57:36.870
No! The accident blocked it!
You can't get through.

57:36.970 --> 57:39.950
You have to turn right.
If he turns right, he'll lose him.

57:40.051 --> 57:41.691
- What did he say?
- Turn right.

57:41.791 --> 57:44.105
What are you doing? Turn right!

57:45.230 --> 57:47.810
Goddamn it.
I can't get out! Fuck! Shit!

57:47.910 --> 57:51.590
Let me back on the road!
Get out of the way! Move it!

58:04.550 --> 58:06.850
OK, they're falling behind.

58:06.951 --> 58:09.950
But don't stop. Don't stop.

58:10.870 --> 58:12.351
Where is Chord?

58:13.211 --> 58:14.670
I lost him!

58:15.850 --> 58:19.311
There's an alley 100 yards... ahead.

58:19.911 --> 58:21.111
Turn in.

58:28.370 --> 58:29.630
Stop!

58:42.530 --> 58:44.981
We lost him? We lost Chord?

58:45.081 --> 58:49.891
Son of a bitch. We don't have a chance
unless he keeps flipping trucks over.

58:49.991 --> 58:54.660
We can't trace him and we don't know
what kind of hardware he's carrying.

58:57.091 --> 58:58.351
What's that?

59:02.031 --> 59:04.741
My website. Chord is controlling it.

59:04.841 --> 59:08.541
I'll do anything you say, OK?
I'll do anything you say, OK?

59:08.641 --> 59:10.711
Son of a bitch.

59:10.811 --> 59:13.130
I'll do anything you say, OK?

59:13.231 --> 59:14.480
What is that?

59:14.580 --> 59:19.650
It's not just your website. It's...
oh, my God. It's a massive virus.

59:19.751 --> 59:21.620
Most of the addresses are
showing the same thing.

59:21.721 --> 59:24.160
That's almost 1/3 of
the global network.

59:24.260 --> 59:28.391
- How can he do that?
- I have absolutely no idea.

59:29.490 --> 59:33.271
He's doing it from the same terminal
he used to get inside my computer.

59:33.371 --> 59:36.870
- You might be able to trace the source.
- Yeah. Right.

59:45.481 --> 59:49.490
You were able to tap the ping-pong cameras.
The ones he had all over the house.

59:49.881 --> 59:52.649
You want us to tap them again?
It could be dangerous.

59:52.749 --> 59:56.290
- The house is full of agents.
- No, not those. He has more.

59:56.390 --> 59:59.390
His bag is filled with them.
Didn't you see? They were spilling out.

59:59.490 --> 01:00:01.891
- Shit, you're right!
- Can you locate them?

01:00:01.991 --> 01:00:05.850
It's harder if they're moving, but...

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:07.991
I did it!

01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:11.941
I traced the website.
I found it. His server.

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:14.730
Seriously? Can we get in?

01:00:16.171 --> 01:00:19.610
He detected me and put in a firewall.
His equipment is very good.

01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:22.230
But I was able to copy a video file.

01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:27.160
What is this?

01:00:29.011 --> 01:00:30.607
Are those...?

01:00:32.361 --> 01:00:35.431
That's how he had the
Internet in his pocket.

01:00:36.071 --> 01:00:39.370
Where did he get
these kind of servers?

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:43.901
What made you pick that file?

01:00:44.001 --> 01:00:45.371
Look at the name.

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:50.091
Triops Team Call.
That's us! Wait a second.

01:00:50.211 --> 01:00:53.741
April 16th, that's the date of our...

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:56.570
What is it?

01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:59.350
That's our greeting.
Don't you remember?

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:02.670
We sent you this, then later,
you called us back.

01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:04.650
That's your equipment, Nevada.

01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:09.890
And if that's your equipment,
then, then that's you.

01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:24.744
Shit, shit.

01:01:25.344 --> 01:01:29.310
That's Nevada!
The guy with the mask is Nevada.

01:01:29.410 --> 01:01:32.610
Nevada's in the middle of an
operation and we're screwing it up!

01:01:32.770 --> 01:01:35.070
If Chord is Nevada,
then who's that guy?

01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:38.161
He's a nobody! He's a decoy!

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:41.530
Nevada has been using him and his
connection to throw off the police!

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:44.510
That's why we confused his shitty
laptop with Nevada's terminal.

01:01:44.610 --> 01:01:47.078
He's been tricking us the whole time!

01:01:47.278 --> 01:01:50.540
I never tricked you! I never said
I was Nevada. My name is Nick.

01:01:50.641 --> 01:01:55.140
There they are.
The 23 ping-pong cameras, all together.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.870
It's his car. He's heading
west on Endfield.

01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:01.510
- Turn that off!
- What? Jill is that car.

01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:03.590
Deconnecte ce trou du cul.

01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:06.791
Pas question de me deconnecter!
Fait es ça et vous verrez!

01:02:09.729 --> 01:02:11.840
Tu parles français aussi,
putain de mytho!

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:14.530
J'ai jamais dit que je
parlais pas français!

01:02:15.211 --> 01:02:17.161
Who cares if you do speak French!

01:02:17.261 --> 01:02:20.390
Why are we still connected
to this enfoiré?

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:22.971
If you disconnect me,
I'll tell the police about you!

01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:25.640
Oh, yes? And what will you say?

01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:29.111
We won't leave anything traceable
on that cheap laptop of yours.

01:02:32.810 --> 01:02:34.371
I got you!

01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:37.211
Erase his hard drive!

01:02:38.091 --> 01:02:39.650
It's right here.

01:02:40.191 --> 01:02:41.231
What did you say?

01:02:41.331 --> 01:02:44.890
It's right here.
I made a copy. Fuck you!

01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:48.270
Why did you do that?

01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:50.730
Because I'm sick of this shit!

01:02:52.161 --> 01:02:54.110
Should I turn left or right?

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:57.371
If you turn right on East 2nd,
you've got a clear path.

01:03:03.341 --> 01:03:06.750
Chord is nearby. I'm going to cross
the signal from the ping-pong cameras.

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:10.590
What are you doing?
Wait a second. Nick. Nick!

01:03:10.690 --> 01:03:13.451
Keep going. Keep going
until you get to the bridge.

01:03:13.751 --> 01:03:17.131
There is something very,
very few people know.

01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:23.256
Do you remember this?

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:28.549
That was Nevada!
He organized the heist,

01:03:28.649 --> 01:03:31.699
took the ransom money,
and returned the painting damaged.

01:03:32.699 --> 01:03:34.811
This is the police detective
who disappeared overnight

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:36.410
after arranging the ransom payment.

01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:39.341
And this is the restorer
who charged a fortune

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.351
to remove the stain
from the painting.

01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:44.581
Look closely. They're both Nevada!

01:03:45.181 --> 01:03:47.921
Remember when little Danny was
rescued and it was all a hoax?

01:03:48.021 --> 01:03:49.350
The Guinean flu epidemic?

01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:52.790
When Marker Financials disappeared?
And the Wall Street extortions?

01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:55.961
They were all Nevada operations.

01:03:56.061 --> 01:03:58.530
This was Nevada. This was Nevada.

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:03.431
And this guy. Even this guy.
He can be anyone!

01:04:05.011 --> 01:04:06.850
Do you understand?

01:04:07.241 --> 01:04:10.810
The man with the mask is Nevada.
We'd better stay out of it.

01:04:10.911 --> 01:04:12.081
- The map!
- What?

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:13.611
Look at the map!

01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:16.979
He's here. Nick?

01:04:17.079 --> 01:04:18.780
I'm looking right at him.

01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:22.890
You should see him any second now.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.540
He's going to pass right
in front of you in 3,

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:32.140
2, 1...

01:04:43.981 --> 01:04:45.780
He didn't recognize you.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.750
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

01:04:56.290 --> 01:04:59.131
- Let me try something.
- What are you doing?

01:05:00.411 --> 01:05:02.190
The feed from all the cameras,

01:05:02.291 --> 01:05:05.530
they can be generated as one
signal if we cross the frequency.

01:05:12.201 --> 01:05:14.311
OK, you can see it, right?

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:16.011
When the ping-pongs
are closed together,

01:05:16.111 --> 01:05:19.051
they can build a real-time
3D model like this.

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.350
It's a bag.

01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:24.886
All the cameras are inside of the bag.
From the shape of the bag,

01:05:24.986 --> 01:05:28.450
it could be lying inside a trunk.

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:30.990
- Hold on!
- What?

01:05:31.091 --> 01:05:33.460
Put it back like it was before,
when you could see the bottom.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.890
OK.

01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:38.291
Look how the shape of the
bag changes right there.

01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:42.131
- Look, right there.
- A foot! It's a foot!

01:05:42.231 --> 01:05:44.800
It's hers. She's in the trunk.

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:54.380
Nick, listen. In the last 5 years,

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:59.081
Nevada has organized more than 30
carefully designed revolutionary operations

01:05:59.181 --> 01:06:01.891
and has never produced
a single victim.

01:06:02.191 --> 01:06:05.415
A single victim! Don't you get it?
He isn't going to hurt her.

01:06:05.515 --> 01:06:07.991
- The girl is safe.
- He's already hurt her enough!

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.171
He's right, Pierre.

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:18.640
Is there any doubt it's him?

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:22.981
Nobody in the world has
this kind of technology.

01:06:23.081 --> 01:06:26.081
He's the only one capable of this.

01:06:26.181 --> 01:06:28.380
That's true, but Nevada would
never have done something...

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.720
You always have
to wait until the end!

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:35.651
It will make sense in the end!
It always does!

01:06:36.051 --> 01:06:38.790
What's that up there? Could it be...

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:41.651
Is that a cell phone?

01:06:42.050 --> 01:06:44.490
Yes! It's her cell phone!

01:06:46.331 --> 01:06:48.531
What are you doing now?

01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:54.770
Jill? Jill? Can you hear me?

01:06:56.371 --> 01:06:58.440
Behind you. In the bag.

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:02.051
Jill! Can you hear me?

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:05.631
It's me, the guy from before.

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:08.011
- You?
- Jill!

01:07:09.421 --> 01:07:12.430
- We're gonna get you out of there.
- How?

01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:17.111
- Just keep your voice down.
- I'm in the trunk. My hands are tied.

01:07:17.211 --> 01:07:20.031
- We're following your car.
- Where is he taking me?

01:07:20.431 --> 01:07:22.830
Jill, listen to me.
There's a knife in the bag.

01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:23.971
What?

01:07:24.371 --> 01:07:28.011
There's a knife in the bag. You can
reach your hand in there and take it out.

01:07:29.331 --> 01:07:31.611
You might be able to
use it to cut the rope.

01:07:33.031 --> 01:07:34.214
That's it.

01:07:36.631 --> 01:07:38.471
A little to the left, Jill.

01:07:39.799 --> 01:07:42.030
That's it. Can you feel the blade?

01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:44.611
Yeah, I got it.

01:07:49.631 --> 01:07:52.470
Shit, red light. Stay away from him.

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:56.191
- No, no, no, he should keep moving.
- No, he's going to see him.

01:07:56.291 --> 01:07:57.851
- He's going to see him.
- No, don't worry.

01:07:57.951 --> 01:08:00.131
- Listen to me. He won't see you.
- No, he must turn back.

01:08:00.231 --> 01:08:02.931
Just listen to me.
He should act normal.

01:08:03.031 --> 01:08:05.730
- He should keep moving.
- Nick! Turn back now!

01:08:10.951 --> 01:08:16.109
I see police cars just east of there.
They keep coming.

01:08:28.291 --> 01:08:30.810
What's he doing?
Why's he waiting there?

01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:35.371
Shit! He saw me!

01:08:47.751 --> 01:08:51.520
They saw you, Nick.
I can't divert them this time!

01:08:55.571 --> 01:08:57.611
Oh, no, no, no!

01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:03.151
We're losing him, we're losing him!

01:09:06.671 --> 01:09:07.710
Fuck.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:15.907
Fuck.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:48.430
Those sirens... is that you?

01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:52.790
Yeah, that's me.
Just give me a minute.

01:10:05.010 --> 01:10:06.710
What are you doing, Jill?

01:10:08.491 --> 01:10:11.470
There might be... a lever.

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:15.422
- Lever? What lever?
- The seats might be retractable.

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:30.511
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

01:10:32.691 --> 01:10:35.260
Jill... what are you doing?

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:39.160
- I might be able to get to him.
- And do what?

01:10:42.431 --> 01:10:45.571
- I have a knife.
- No, no, no. Don't do anything.

01:10:45.671 --> 01:10:49.410
Stay where you are. Don't let
go of the knife, just stay there.

01:10:49.611 --> 01:10:50.941
The sirens.

01:10:51.041 --> 01:10:53.291
We're behind you.
We're almost caught up.

01:10:53.391 --> 01:10:55.852
I don't hear the sirens anymore.

01:10:55.952 --> 01:10:59.626
He's 3 blocks ahead. Keep going.

01:11:04.861 --> 01:11:08.490
He's in front of you. You'll see
him any moment. Keep going straight.

01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:12.231
That car straight ahead?
He's coming in the opposite direction.

01:11:12.331 --> 01:11:14.751
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

01:11:14.851 --> 01:11:16.770
- Fuck! No!
- It's on the map!

01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:20.090
I know! Shit! Shit! Shit!

01:11:26.611 --> 01:11:29.031
- Jill, wait... listen.
- What?

01:11:29.231 --> 01:11:32.390
We're right behind you. Can you hear
the sirens again? Can you hear them now?

01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:34.251
- Yes.
- Then sit tight and wait!

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:46.400
Not in this trunk.

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:03.051
Nevada! It's me, Pierre!
With the Triops, in Paris!

01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:05.530
- Nevada!
- I blocked him!

01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:07.430
- What?
- I blocked him!

01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:08.891
Unblock Nevada!

01:12:13.171 --> 01:12:15.731
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:17.431
Pierre! Where are you going?

01:12:19.661 --> 01:12:22.151
Pierre! Pierre!

01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:25.610
- Pierre!
- Hey, what's going on?

01:12:27.441 --> 01:12:29.101
Pierre, where are you going?

01:12:31.509 --> 01:12:32.688
Pierre, stop!

01:12:32.788 --> 01:12:36.281
I have to help him! I have to help him!
I have to help Nevada!

01:12:36.381 --> 01:12:38.082
What's going on?

01:12:38.182 --> 01:12:41.191
What the fuck is... yeah, listen!

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:42.792
Listen...

01:13:10.752 --> 01:13:12.751
Nevada, behind you!

01:13:13.251 --> 01:13:14.650
No!

01:13:25.961 --> 01:13:27.338
No, no, no, no!

01:13:34.412 --> 01:13:35.770
No!

01:15:04.331 --> 01:15:09.853
That is the call he... he made
back... back to us... that day.

01:15:16.172 --> 01:15:20.512
But I don't understand.
Why is he hiding?

01:15:26.552 --> 01:15:28.858
What the fuck? Who is this?

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:35.852
What makes you think you
can contact me like this?

01:15:36.991 --> 01:15:39.661
Nevada! Are you Nevada?

01:15:39.961 --> 01:15:42.091
Yes, I am.

01:16:00.151 --> 01:16:01.692
I just killed Nevada.

01:16:03.363 --> 01:16:07.091
It may've looked simple enough,
but it was actually the hardest part.

01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:10.371
All the servers are mine now.

01:16:12.432 --> 01:16:17.493
Now I can make jillgoddardcaught.com
the most popular website of all time.

01:16:21.141 --> 01:16:23.191
This is what I took.

01:16:23.811 --> 01:16:25.852
And there's the rest of it.

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:36.672
There will be bigger fires, Jill.
Wait and see.

01:16:53.971 --> 01:16:55.611
I'm sorry.

01:17:08.621 --> 01:17:10.076
Jill...

01:17:11.151 --> 01:17:12.714
Jill...

01:17:14.652 --> 01:17:17.712
Jill... can you hear me?

01:17:31.211 --> 01:17:34.371
Chord! Where's Jill?

01:17:36.081 --> 01:17:38.133
Where she's always been.

01:17:40.325 --> 01:17:43.211
- On the Internet.
- I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:17:43.892 --> 01:17:46.032
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:48.912
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:17:49.592 --> 01:17:51.812
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:17:52.562 --> 01:17:55.502
- I'll do anything you say, OK?
- Please! Stop that music!

01:17:55.602 --> 01:17:57.871
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:17:58.371 --> 01:18:00.604
- Take out the CD.
- I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:18:01.417 --> 01:18:03.534
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:18:04.381 --> 01:18:06.511
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:18:07.111 --> 01:18:09.612
- Throw it away.
- I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:18:10.112 --> 01:18:12.321
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:18:13.021 --> 01:18:15.138
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:18:16.031 --> 01:18:18.172
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:18:19.011 --> 01:18:21.111
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:18:21.865 --> 01:18:24.732
- I'll do anything you say, OK?
- Shitty music.

01:18:24.832 --> 01:18:27.011
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:18:27.662 --> 01:18:29.831
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:18:30.502 --> 01:18:32.692
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:18:33.471 --> 01:18:35.652
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:18:36.371 --> 01:18:38.472
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:41.391
I'll do anything you say, OK?

01:18:45.552 --> 01:18:49.592
Hello. Sorry, what you're
seeing isn't a stolen video.

01:18:49.692 --> 01:18:51.952
This is not a recording.

01:18:54.991 --> 01:18:57.931
The explosives you see
behind Jill Goddard

01:18:58.031 --> 01:19:01.071
are programmed to
detonate in one minute.

01:19:01.171 --> 01:19:03.801
Jill will not survive the blast.

01:19:03.901 --> 01:19:07.472
The detonator is synchronized
with the counter on this website,

01:19:07.572 --> 01:19:09.742
which you can see right here.

01:19:09.842 --> 01:19:12.541
If more than half of you
who came to this website

01:19:12.641 --> 01:19:17.223
looking for a stolen video
leave right now, she lives.

01:19:17.323 --> 01:19:20.471
If you stay, she dies.

01:19:21.292 --> 01:19:23.551
You have 10 seconds.

01:19:43.642 --> 01:19:45.220
Yeah.

01:19:51.831 --> 01:19:53.751
It's amazing.

01:19:56.952 --> 01:19:59.131
You can watch it later.

01:19:59.391 --> 01:20:04.031
I'm recording it. I've been
recording everything I've done.

01:20:04.592 --> 01:20:07.192
This will be the final shot.

01:20:10.702 --> 01:20:15.391
Years from now,
everybody will see it.

01:20:15.642 --> 01:20:18.012
They'll know what I did for you.

01:20:19.311 --> 01:20:22.932
Everything I've said was true.
The counter was real.

01:20:24.281 --> 01:20:26.511
Do you want to know how
many people left the website?

01:20:26.611 --> 01:20:29.391
How many feared for your life?

01:20:35.361 --> 01:20:37.112
I'm sorry.

01:20:44.422 --> 01:20:47.852
Not even 10% of the bastards.

01:20:49.672 --> 01:20:51.450
There you have it.

01:20:51.712 --> 01:20:54.611
That's the world
you're leaving behind.

01:20:57.552 --> 01:21:02.271
By the way... sorry I
had to knock you out.

01:21:02.672 --> 01:21:04.622
- I just...
- Leave behind?

01:21:04.722 --> 01:21:07.107
What do you mean "leave behind"?

01:21:18.302 --> 01:21:20.031
What are you doing?

01:21:21.711 --> 01:21:22.871
No! Wait!

01:21:22.972 --> 01:21:25.682
- It's OK. Calm down.
- Wait a minute.

01:21:26.241 --> 01:21:28.076
Just wait!

01:21:30.011 --> 01:21:32.272
Are you still recording?

01:21:32.851 --> 01:21:34.353
Yeah.

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:37.074
Do you mind?

01:21:37.322 --> 01:21:39.521
No, but...

01:21:48.772 --> 01:21:50.932
Only 10%?

01:21:51.812 --> 01:21:54.171
Only 10%.

01:21:59.312 --> 01:22:01.712
I think I understand now.

01:22:03.011 --> 01:22:06.131
There were plenty of other
ways to do this, but...

01:22:09.191 --> 01:22:13.192
You wanted to open
my eyes, is that it?

01:22:14.345 --> 01:22:18.962
None of this is new to you.
But I wanted you to see it.

01:22:20.031 --> 01:22:21.892
Who are you?

01:22:22.572 --> 01:22:25.099
How do you know so much about me?

01:22:27.911 --> 01:22:31.181
I've been watching
you for a long time.

01:22:31.281 --> 01:22:33.611
I know you better than anyone.

01:22:33.711 --> 01:22:36.911
And I know what everybody
was doing to you.

01:22:41.191 --> 01:22:43.445
When people see this,

01:22:44.245 --> 01:22:49.371
I don't want them to
see me tied up like this.

01:22:50.692 --> 01:22:54.892
I want them to see me walk out
of here on my own two feet.

01:23:00.402 --> 01:23:02.752
No! No!

01:23:03.572 --> 01:23:05.691
Listen to me, please!

01:23:05.791 --> 01:23:10.211
Point the gun at me! Point it...
point it at me as I go in!

01:23:17.762 --> 01:23:19.872
If you're careful...

01:23:21.361 --> 01:23:24.852
people won't see the
gun in the video.

01:23:25.332 --> 01:23:28.572
They'll think I chose to go in.

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:34.542
I've been tied up for too long.

01:24:00.712 --> 01:24:04.292
I arranged for the fire to crush
the building in a few minutes.

01:24:04.392 --> 01:24:06.901
Nobody will find us down there.

01:24:07.112 --> 01:24:09.651
We'll be safe for a long time.

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:13.411
A very long time.

01:24:20.622 --> 01:24:23.491
Is the gun down so no one can see it?

01:24:23.592 --> 01:24:25.151
Yes.

01:24:29.991 --> 01:24:34.891
OK, I can start again...
from over there.

01:24:36.191 --> 01:24:37.568
And...

01:24:39.171 --> 01:24:40.932
you stay there.

01:24:43.132 --> 01:24:44.451
OK?

01:24:44.711 --> 01:24:46.241
OK.

01:24:52.882 --> 01:24:54.762
Actually...

01:24:55.662 --> 01:24:58.260
come closer so you can see me better.

01:25:08.502 --> 01:25:10.852
If you start at my feet...

01:25:11.902 --> 01:25:15.031
and slowly move back up to my face...

01:25:15.642 --> 01:25:18.952
when they see,
when they see how happy I am,

01:25:19.532 --> 01:25:21.671
it'll be a surprise.

01:25:46.212 --> 01:25:48.912
What a bunch of crap, Chord.

01:25:50.412 --> 01:25:52.712
What? Who are you?

01:25:52.842 --> 01:25:54.911
You know who I am.

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:04.722
Nevada?

01:26:05.472 --> 01:26:08.012
Yes, I am.

01:26:09.191 --> 01:26:13.432
It's pathetic enough that you went to
all this trouble to meet a movie star.

01:26:13.532 --> 01:26:16.501
Now I can't let you screw
things up like this.

01:26:17.501 --> 01:26:22.071
And don't even think about hanging up.
I'm trying to help you out.

01:26:22.571 --> 01:26:25.022
- What?
- I don't care if they catch you,

01:26:25.181 --> 01:26:28.281
but I can't let them confiscate
my servers, you idiot.

01:26:28.381 --> 01:26:29.682
- It makes me sick.
- But...

01:26:29.782 --> 01:26:33.782
But right now, I have to save
your ass. The kid saw your face.

01:26:33.882 --> 01:26:36.652
You mean Nick? Nick's dead.

01:26:36.752 --> 01:26:39.092
Nick's alive, you fool.

01:26:41.932 --> 01:26:43.303
Nick...

01:26:45.212 --> 01:26:46.451
but... but...

01:26:46.551 --> 01:26:50.112
Move, you dumbshit! Go after
him and shoot him for good.

01:26:50.212 --> 01:26:51.771
- Hurry!
- Shit!

01:26:55.341 --> 01:26:58.018
I have a lock on the police position.

01:26:58.812 --> 01:27:01.282
I'll let you know when they're close.

01:27:03.652 --> 01:27:06.851
- Then... you're alive.
- Of course I'm alive.

01:27:06.951 --> 01:27:10.752
You botched the job. You can't
even shoot someone in the back.

01:27:10.852 --> 01:27:15.592
I was coming from an operation.
I was wearing a bulletproof vest, genius.

01:27:15.692 --> 01:27:18.602
The saddest part is if you'd
looked closely at your recordings,

01:27:18.702 --> 01:27:22.001
you would've realized.
Go ahead. Take a look.

01:27:23.001 --> 01:27:25.795
Don't worry. He isn't going anywhere.

01:27:31.241 --> 01:27:34.182
Look for the moment
right after you shot me.

01:27:38.341 --> 01:27:41.781
Look at me. Look closely.

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:50.791
- You heard me.
- I didn't know who the fuck you were.

01:27:50.891 --> 01:27:53.802
But yes, I heard you
say something out loud.

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:59.472
"Now, I can make jillgoddardcaught.com
the most popular website of all time."

01:27:59.872 --> 01:28:01.211
And that was my only clue.

01:28:03.536 --> 01:28:07.482
As soon as I recovered, I checked
out that website and its owner.

01:28:07.582 --> 01:28:09.652
Nick Chambers.

01:28:09.752 --> 01:28:13.821
But he was just some poor kid
jerking off with a normal laptop.

01:28:13.921 --> 01:28:17.091
So, in order to find you,

01:28:17.191 --> 01:28:20.061
I did what I've done
many times before.

01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:23.462
Play a role. Change my face.

01:28:23.982 --> 01:28:26.401
I became Nick Chambers.

01:28:31.572 --> 01:28:34.052
- Son of a bitch.
- What? Don't shoot him!

01:28:34.152 --> 01:28:35.400
What's wrong?

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:39.040
Don't you get the real reason I
have you leave the warehouse?

01:28:39.381 --> 01:28:41.711
- You really don't see it.
- See what?

01:28:41.811 --> 01:28:44.382
That kid you're looking
at doesn't know a thing.

01:28:44.482 --> 01:28:46.243
- He's been asleep all day.
- What?

01:28:46.372 --> 01:28:48.512
Since I nabbed him at a gas
station on his way from L.A.

01:28:48.612 --> 01:28:50.982
- Wait a second!
- He's been in the trunk the whole time.

01:28:51.082 --> 01:28:52.021
What the fuck is this?

01:28:52.121 --> 01:28:55.831
He's not the one you've been
playing with all night. I am.

01:28:55.931 --> 01:28:58.092
- What?
- Look at your screen.

01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:05.331
- But...
- Hi, Chord.

01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:13.791
Well. It seems you're not the only one
driving around with someone in the trunk.

01:29:13.891 --> 01:29:15.881
How can it be?

01:29:33.832 --> 01:29:38.842
This is the real Nick Chambers.
Don't worry, he's OK.

01:29:38.942 --> 01:29:42.942
I stole his identity and his computer
so I could find out who you were.

01:29:43.042 --> 01:29:45.211
And find a way to hunt you down.

01:29:59.762 --> 01:30:02.832
And now what you're watching
here is time-delayed.

01:30:02.932 --> 01:30:06.532
I got the idea to use video
with time delay from you.

01:30:06.832 --> 01:30:10.901
By the time you see this,
I might already be saving her.

01:30:11.001 --> 01:30:14.201
This recording was the only
way I could thank you.

01:30:17.572 --> 01:30:19.441
Thank you, Chord.

01:30:27.752 --> 01:30:29.329
By the way...

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:36.591
this CD is mine. The band is called
"Suicide" and they are awesome.

01:30:52.542 --> 01:30:54.211
Fuck!

01:31:09.862 --> 01:31:12.361
- Over here!
- Yes!

01:31:18.771 --> 01:31:21.302
Fuck! Fuck, Fuck!

01:31:26.241 --> 01:31:28.011
Jesus Christ!

01:32:05.181 --> 01:32:07.552
Please, open the door.

01:32:07.692 --> 01:32:11.796
Jill. Please, you've got
to believe me. Jill.

01:32:12.396 --> 01:32:16.772
You... you... you need me!

01:32:35.592 --> 01:32:37.381
It's over.

01:33:04.241 --> 01:33:06.008
My God.

01:33:06.631 --> 01:33:08.690
All of my favorite movies,

01:33:09.490 --> 01:33:12.586
music, books...

01:33:27.632 --> 01:33:29.509
My equipment.

01:33:35.341 --> 01:33:38.642
Don't worry.
I can get us out of here.

01:33:38.842 --> 01:33:41.241
Not right now, of course, but...

01:33:41.341 --> 01:33:43.551
we can wait for them to...

01:33:44.281 --> 01:33:45.681
You want one?

01:33:45.781 --> 01:33:49.422
At this point, the producers of
"Dark Sky: The Third Wave,"

01:33:49.522 --> 01:33:51.421
the actress' latest premiere,

01:33:51.521 --> 01:33:55.361
have announced they will make an
official statement in the next few hours.

01:33:55.462 --> 01:33:57.692
I owe you an apology.

01:33:58.632 --> 01:34:02.592
I've been tracking that
madman all this time and...

01:34:02.852 --> 01:34:05.552
I had no idea of what
he was really up to.

01:34:06.472 --> 01:34:11.418
I didn't know you were in danger,
that he was going to hurt you.

01:34:12.742 --> 01:34:15.137
By the time I realized, I...

01:34:16.091 --> 01:34:19.152
I didn't have enough time to react.

01:34:20.731 --> 01:34:23.954
I think I could have prevented it.

01:34:24.912 --> 01:34:28.331
I could have prevented
everything that he...

01:34:29.231 --> 01:34:31.156
everything he...

01:34:35.059 --> 01:34:36.660
Sorry.

01:34:45.041 --> 01:34:47.392
Who the fuck are you?

01:34:47.492 --> 01:34:48.982
What?

01:34:49.891 --> 01:34:51.605
I'm...

01:34:52.005 --> 01:34:53.595
nobody.

01:35:01.832 --> 01:35:03.883
What are you going
to do after all of this?

01:35:03.983 --> 01:35:09.463
Disappear. Actually, I'd very much
appreciate it if you didn't mention me.

01:35:19.882 --> 01:35:22.582
- What's in it for me?
- What?

01:35:22.682 --> 01:35:26.382
What do I get out of it if I
don't tell anyone about you?

01:35:28.381 --> 01:35:31.001
While the Internet is
recovering from the attack,

01:35:31.101 --> 01:35:34.991
tickets for "Dark Sky:
The Third Wave," the film,

01:35:35.091 --> 01:35:38.612
are being sold at a
record-setting pace.

01:35:40.632 --> 01:35:43.171
It is a tragedy, a real tragedy.

01:35:43.271 --> 01:35:47.802
But now, I think the best way to
honor her is to enjoy her work.

01:35:50.612 --> 01:35:56.017
She was in the prime of her life,
of her career. She loved this movie.

01:35:56.117 --> 01:36:01.611
She was so enthusiastic about
her work. I can't believe it.

01:36:07.962 --> 01:36:10.152
I'd like to as well.

01:36:10.712 --> 01:36:12.679
You'd like to what?

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:16.291
Disappear.

01:36:17.802 --> 01:36:21.291
Sure. For how long?

01:36:24.512 --> 01:36:26.341
Long enough.
