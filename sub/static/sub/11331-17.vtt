00:00.840 --> 00:03.616
Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...

00:03.617 --> 00:04.948
You need some help.

00:04.949 --> 00:06.589
You can't get over what
happened to you alone!

00:06.590 --> 00:08.119
Would you just drop it, Grace!

00:08.121 --> 00:09.836
Ricky, I want to get married.

00:09.837 --> 00:11.076
And you want to go to school in New York?

00:11.077 --> 00:12.598
Yeah, kind of.

00:12.702 --> 00:15.256
It was a wedding gift.
There was no wedding.

00:15.425 --> 00:16.265
Okay.

00:16.267 --> 00:18.322
Amy's taking a little tour of the school?

00:18.323 --> 00:19.860
She should take a tour of the school.

00:19.861 --> 00:21.344
It's an honor to get into that school,

00:21.345 --> 00:23.245
and if she wants to go
there, she can go there.

00:23.246 --> 00:24.745
What happened to Dylan?

00:25.038 --> 00:26.088
We're just friends.

00:26.089 --> 00:27.980
Just like you'll be
friends with Ricky some day.

00:27.981 --> 00:30.127
You know I love you. I'm not
going to run off with this woman.

00:30.128 --> 00:33.975
She's flying you all the way
across the country for a sandwich.

00:33.976 --> 00:37.060
Adrian, Ms. Wilkenson is 73.

00:37.478 --> 00:38.445
You tell him!

00:39.516 --> 00:40.883
I bought the restaurant.

00:40.894 --> 00:42.135
This restaurant?

00:42.917 --> 00:44.531
Congratulations, George.

00:44.532 --> 00:45.409
To me!

00:45.646 --> 00:47.657
Listen to me, don't do anything stupid.

00:47.658 --> 00:49.840
Listen to me, you're doing something stupid

00:49.841 --> 00:52.217
when you let Amy go to
New York to go to school.

00:52.394 --> 00:53.338
It's me.

00:53.556 --> 00:55.367
Open up. Come on, we're going to my house.

00:57.027 --> 00:59.329
Don't shoot. It's me, George.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.412
Oh, no.

01:00.499 --> 01:02.494
I can't force him to go to therapy!

01:02.495 --> 01:04.563
He'll go when he's ready
to go! He's not ready!

01:04.565 --> 01:07.096
Oh, no, he's ready. He almost killed me!

01:07.097 --> 01:08.340
Well, what the hell are you doing

01:08.341 --> 01:10.819
breaking into the guest
house this time of night?

01:10.852 --> 01:13.037
If you knew he had an issue
with not being able to sleep

01:13.038 --> 01:14.575
because of a traumatic incident,

01:14.576 --> 01:16.968
why would you break in on him, George?

01:17.041 --> 01:19.185
Hell, hasn't my son been through enough?

01:19.186 --> 01:20.933
I sympathize, I do,

01:20.934 --> 01:23.264
but he can't be allowed to
go around shooting people.

01:23.265 --> 01:24.747
That guy is out of the country.

01:24.748 --> 01:27.395
The police said he's out of the
country. He's nowhere near here.

01:27.396 --> 01:28.668
And I almost got shot!

01:28.669 --> 01:30.164
His dad left him the gun.

01:30.165 --> 01:32.389
We didn't know he had
taken it from the house.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.685
When we moved back from the
condo into the parsonage here,

01:34.686 --> 01:35.948
we put it in the hall closet

01:35.949 --> 01:37.649
instead of our closet
where we'd always had it.

01:37.650 --> 01:40.851
You're supposed to keep it locked
up and unloaded at all times.

01:40.852 --> 01:43.133
It was. I thought it was.

01:43.642 --> 01:45.973
And we always stressed gun safety with him.

01:47.021 --> 01:48.642
It was the only thing his father left him,

01:48.643 --> 01:50.141
and he's never expressed interest in it

01:50.142 --> 01:52.280
other than as something
to remember his father by.

01:52.281 --> 01:54.297
And who ever thinks their
son will shoot someone?

01:54.298 --> 01:56.277
Well, apparently not the parents
of kids who shoot someone.

01:56.278 --> 01:57.430
Exactly!

01:57.679 --> 01:59.276
I know that "He doesn't seem like the type"

01:59.277 --> 02:00.298
is not a good excuse...

02:00.299 --> 02:01.832
There's no excuse.

02:01.971 --> 02:03.343
Did you know the biggest
threat from being shot

02:03.344 --> 02:04.991
comes from keeping a gun in the house?

02:04.999 --> 02:06.675
Some people say if you
have a gun in your house,

02:06.676 --> 02:09.440
it's over 20 times more likely
to hurt you than protect you.

02:09.441 --> 02:12.939
And most accidental shootings
happen to people under 25-years-old.

02:13.615 --> 02:15.125
I own guns. I know this stuff.

02:15.126 --> 02:17.421
Jack knew where the gun was, he took it.

02:18.485 --> 02:19.738
We didn't know.

02:20.722 --> 02:23.589
Look, I am really sorry.

02:24.989 --> 02:26.005
I'll talk to Jack.

02:26.006 --> 02:28.273
I've tried talking to him,
I'll talk to him again.

02:28.274 --> 02:30.068
We'd like him to stay with us.

02:30.570 --> 02:32.970
I mean, we tried to
get him to stay with us,

02:32.971 --> 02:34.832
but he doesn't like sleeping alone

02:34.833 --> 02:36.764
so he wants to be here with Grace.

02:37.721 --> 02:39.492
Guess he didn't know what
to do when she left town.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.521
But promise, I will talk to him

02:41.588 --> 02:43.221
and I'll try and get him
to see someone, again.

02:43.222 --> 02:45.405
Not good enough. Trying is not good enough.

02:45.406 --> 02:46.701
The coach made it conditional

02:46.702 --> 02:48.464
to his ever being part of the team again.

02:48.465 --> 02:50.838
He can't motivate him, how
am I supposed to motivate him?

02:50.839 --> 02:52.949
Grace can't even get him to do anything.

02:53.838 --> 02:55.313
You have no idea how frustrating it is

02:55.314 --> 02:58.089
to want to help Jack and
not be able to help him,

02:58.090 --> 03:00.307
especially when my job is helping people.

03:00.704 --> 03:03.507
Hey, I heard you were having
some problems with your ex?

03:03.508 --> 03:04.625
Nice segue, Reverend,

03:04.626 --> 03:06.433
but not the time or the place.

03:06.434 --> 03:08.368
Well, look, it's getting
late. I should get going.

03:08.369 --> 03:10.256
"I"? You mean "We."

03:10.257 --> 03:11.559
You're taking him with you.

03:11.560 --> 03:12.552
I don't care who he sleeps with.

03:12.553 --> 03:13.849
He scared the bejesus out of me.

03:13.850 --> 03:15.953
I'm sure. Good reflexes.

03:15.954 --> 03:17.853
- Goodnight, George.
- No, no, no, no, no goodnight.

03:17.854 --> 03:18.906
I said he's going with you.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.206
Wouldn't it be better if
he went with you and Tom?

03:22.027 --> 03:23.576
I can't sleep, Tom.

03:24.198 --> 03:26.893
Every time I close my
eyes, I see that guy's face.

03:27.727 --> 03:31.216
When I'm in traffic, I think
I see him in the car behind me.

03:31.217 --> 03:33.763
When I'm on campus, I think I
see him peering around doorways,

03:33.764 --> 03:35.716
or watching me in the parking lot.

03:36.159 --> 03:38.532
And when I drive-through
some place and get a burger,

03:38.533 --> 03:40.385
I think he's the guy handing it to me.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.475
I can't get his image
out of my head. I can't.

03:46.633 --> 03:48.406
You know the last thing he said to me?

03:48.855 --> 03:50.643
"Start praying, Christian."

03:51.507 --> 03:52.699
And yet I didn't.

03:53.912 --> 03:56.039
And God took care of me anyway.

03:57.006 --> 03:57.729
He saved me.

03:57.730 --> 04:02.729
He didn't do a very good job of it.

04:03.062 --> 04:03.722
What?

04:03.723 --> 04:06.857
God let you get beat up first,

04:06.858 --> 04:09.198
then he saved you.

04:09.461 --> 04:11.369
Yeah, well, I'm just thankful I'm alive.

04:11.471 --> 04:13.910
This isn't living.

04:13.911 --> 04:18.755
Walking around afraid
that guy will kill you.

04:36.963 --> 04:39.240
That's not how my mom does it.

04:39.319 --> 04:40.910
You're too old for this.
You make your own eggs.

04:40.911 --> 04:42.300
I don't know how.

04:42.301 --> 04:43.258
I'll teach you how.

04:43.259 --> 04:46.459
I know how. I just wanted you to make them.

04:46.460 --> 04:47.622
I already made them.

04:47.978 --> 04:49.244
I'm gonna put the pan in to soak,

04:49.245 --> 04:50.217
you eat your eggs,

04:50.218 --> 04:51.885
then you wash the pan and
put it away, all right?

04:51.886 --> 04:54.083
What is this, boot camp?

04:56.514 --> 04:58.049
Help youelf to anything in the kitchen.

04:58.050 --> 05:00.867
Everyone has to make their own
breakfast here, starting now.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.077
You have any whey?

05:02.134 --> 05:03.374
- Way what?
- Whey?

05:03.375 --> 05:05.170
- Way what?
- Whey.

05:05.171 --> 05:06.657
Protein powder.

05:06.658 --> 05:07.885
- Do you?
- No.

05:07.894 --> 05:08.750
Why do you have to have powder?

05:08.751 --> 05:10.678
Why can't you have the real
thing? Have some eggs and bacon.

05:10.679 --> 05:13.205
Yeah, all right. Can I
get, uh, three poached eggs,

05:13.206 --> 05:15.923
six pieces of well-done
bacon, some whole wheat toast,

05:15.924 --> 05:16.765
no butter, a little honey?

05:16.766 --> 05:18.055
I'll get you some whey.

05:18.309 --> 05:19.433
How long you planning on staying?

05:19.434 --> 05:21.243
How long can I stay? I
slept really great here.

05:21.244 --> 05:24.026
Well, we'll see how it goes.
But you can't, you know,

05:24.027 --> 05:26.572
keep sleeping in the bed
with me. It's not healthy.

05:26.573 --> 05:27.286
I think that's the most

05:27.287 --> 05:29.148
I've slept since I came
home from the hospital.

05:29.149 --> 05:31.633
- Jack...
- I know, I know.

05:31.634 --> 05:33.152
- I'm going to get some help.
- Today.

05:33.153 --> 05:34.814
You promised me if I let you stay over here

05:34.815 --> 05:36.414
you'd go talk to someone today.

05:36.415 --> 05:38.866
Yeah, I know I said that, but
after a good night's sleep,

05:38.867 --> 05:40.619
and after talking to Tom,

05:40.620 --> 05:43.744
and after shooting you, I
feel a lot better. I really do.

05:43.745 --> 05:46.226
You got two choices, this guy
Chan that your doctor recommended,

05:46.227 --> 05:48.306
or Dr. Fields, who I recommend.

05:49.508 --> 05:51.213
Everyone is afraid of something.

05:51.214 --> 05:55.213
You can either hide or
you can face your fears.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.793
What's it going to be?

06:02.317 --> 06:04.679
I told you I'd help you.
Just let me help you.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.935
No, I'm catching on. Really, I am.

06:06.936 --> 06:08.381
Uh, no, you're not.

06:08.382 --> 06:10.530
You're getting farther and farther behind.

06:10.531 --> 06:12.178
Is it further or farther?

06:12.179 --> 06:15.036
Farther. Further is more of a verb.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.694
To further your education,
to further a cause.

06:17.695 --> 06:20.056
Whereas farther indicates distance.

06:20.069 --> 06:21.221
Why did I ask?

06:21.222 --> 06:23.226
- I'll see you at lunch.
- Wait!

06:23.860 --> 06:25.896
My grandmother was hoping you could kind of

06:25.897 --> 06:28.381
hang out with me at the house
until she gets home tonight.

06:28.401 --> 06:29.627
Her friend is having surgery

06:29.628 --> 06:31.913
and she's going to stay at the
hospital with her as long as possible.

06:31.914 --> 06:33.961
And she wants me to stay there with you

06:33.962 --> 06:35.079
with no one else at home,

06:35.080 --> 06:37.402
the entire house to ourselves,
including your bedroom?

06:37.403 --> 06:39.171
Yeah. She totally trusts us.

06:39.234 --> 06:39.737
Why?

06:39.738 --> 06:41.296
Because we're trustworthy.

06:41.297 --> 06:44.153
- And she believed that?
- Yes, she believed it because it's true.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.100
Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.

06:46.146 --> 06:47.247
For all she knows we're going to be

06:47.248 --> 06:49.559
smoking pot and drinking
beer and fooling around.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.750
Yeah, right.

06:51.309 --> 06:53.253
I told her I was going to be
helping you with your algebra.

06:53.254 --> 06:55.291
Why did you do that? That
makes me sound stupid.

06:55.292 --> 06:56.515
No, it doesn't.

06:56.516 --> 06:59.308
It's just the one area of school
where you need a little help.

06:59.823 --> 07:01.445
You can't be good at everything.

07:01.446 --> 07:02.930
I'm not good with anything, am I?

07:02.931 --> 07:06.125
Of course you are. You're
a really good musician.

07:06.138 --> 07:07.184
And you're street smart.

07:07.185 --> 07:09.187
There's a lot to be said for street smart.

07:09.188 --> 07:10.145
Whatever.

07:10.914 --> 07:13.612
I'll come over, we'll
see about the algebra.

07:15.583 --> 07:16.450
What?

07:16.451 --> 07:18.041
Just let me help you.

07:18.042 --> 07:19.146
What are you so afraid of?

07:19.147 --> 07:21.053
That you'll actually learn
something about algebra?

07:21.054 --> 07:22.706
No. That's not it.

07:22.707 --> 07:25.190
And I doubt I will learn
something about algebra.

07:25.485 --> 07:27.618
I just don't do well in these situations.

07:27.619 --> 07:29.978
What situations? Where
someone is helping you?

07:29.979 --> 07:31.538
Where people trust me.

07:31.765 --> 07:33.764
I don't have a good moral compass.

07:33.765 --> 07:36.262
You know, for example, right
now, I'm debating whether or not

07:36.263 --> 07:37.570
I should ask Margaret if I can go

07:37.571 --> 07:39.951
or just lie to her and
not tell her where I am.

07:39.952 --> 07:41.883
Because if I tell her no one
will be home but the two of us,

07:41.884 --> 07:44.455
I think she's going to say,
"Then come on over to our house."

07:44.456 --> 07:45.997
All right. We could do that.

07:45.998 --> 07:47.382
When we could be alone at your house?

07:47.383 --> 07:48.948
We're not going to do anything.

07:48.949 --> 07:52.369
You say that now, but who knows?

07:52.370 --> 07:54.112
- I know.
- No, you don't.

08:00.742 --> 08:03.197
Good morning. I wasn't
expecting you, but good morning.

08:03.198 --> 08:04.584
Your mom left for work already.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.074
I need some help.

08:06.238 --> 08:07.770
Can you watch John?

08:07.771 --> 08:10.862
Some kid bit him at
daycare, he bit the kid back

08:10.863 --> 08:13.583
and they want me to
take him out for the day.

08:13.584 --> 08:16.019
They just called me and I
was on my way to school so...

08:16.033 --> 08:18.762
I know it's a huge favor,
but I can't miss class.

08:18.763 --> 08:19.958
Amy's in New York, you know,

08:19.959 --> 08:21.552
and I have to work this afternoon.

08:21.553 --> 08:24.830
I can't. I got to do
something before I go to work.

08:24.831 --> 08:26.653
Oh. Well, okay.

08:26.654 --> 08:27.916
Maybe Margaret can help you out.

08:27.917 --> 08:29.225
Um, I already called
her. She's working today.

08:29.226 --> 08:32.371
She has some sort of
emergency going on, she can't.

08:32.371 --> 08:35.183
Oh. Sorry, but like I said, I'm working.

08:35.183 --> 08:36.897
It's okay, I'll handle it.

08:36.948 --> 08:39.568
Amy and I have had it easy
between that church nursery

08:39.570 --> 08:41.355
and family helping us with John so...

08:41.599 --> 08:43.482
I'll just have to forget
school and stay home

08:43.484 --> 08:45.053
and take care of my son today.

08:45.054 --> 08:46.504
Mine and Amy's son.

08:46.505 --> 08:48.196
While she's in New York with Ben.

08:48.197 --> 08:50.393
You don't have to worry about
Ben. She's not interested in Ben.

08:50.394 --> 08:53.215
- Who's she interested in?
- No one but herself, apparently.

08:55.960 --> 08:56.534
Hello.

08:56.535 --> 08:57.378
I have a question for you.

08:57.379 --> 08:58.076
Make it quick.

08:58.077 --> 08:59.959
Kathy's invited me to
stay over at her house

08:59.960 --> 09:01.918
when her grandmother isn't
going to be home and...

09:01.919 --> 09:02.738
No.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.898
- Hey, Ricky!
- Hey.

09:05.899 --> 09:06.772
What's going on?

09:06.773 --> 09:09.738
Nothing. We had a little sleepover
while the girls are out of town.

09:10.118 --> 09:12.492
Jack tried to shoot him.

09:12.493 --> 09:14.559
- I missed.
- You shot at George? For what?

09:14.560 --> 09:16.221
I don't think we need
to tell everybody, Jack.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.840
It doesn't exactly make you look good, son.

09:17.841 --> 09:19.969
- You shot him with a gun?
- Yes.

09:19.970 --> 09:22.418
We dropped by after work.

09:22.526 --> 09:23.963
I say, after work.

09:24.832 --> 09:27.242
And when I knocked on the guest
house door, I startled Jack.

09:27.243 --> 09:28.581
It's nothing you need
to be concerned about.

09:28.582 --> 09:30.684
Okay. Uh, what work?

09:30.685 --> 09:31.804
- Finally.
- You didn't hear?

09:31.805 --> 09:33.499
- He bought Geoff's.
- Geoff's restaurant?

09:33.500 --> 09:35.597
- Yep.
- Can't you keep up?

09:35.598 --> 09:37.436
I guess not. When did that happen?

09:37.437 --> 09:38.222
I invited you and Amy to

09:38.223 --> 09:39.814
meet me for dinner last
night, and that's why.

09:39.815 --> 09:40.785
I wanted to surprise you.

09:40.786 --> 09:43.072
I'm surprise, all right. You bought Geoff's?

09:43.073 --> 09:45.275
I didn't know you knew anything
about the restaurant business.

09:45.276 --> 09:47.188
- He doesn't.
- How hard can it be?

09:47.189 --> 09:48.040
Hard.

09:48.299 --> 09:50.238
It's a risk. If you want
anything out of life,

09:50.239 --> 09:51.623
you've got to take a risk.

09:51.738 --> 09:52.920
You cannot be afraid of failing,

09:52.921 --> 09:54.626
or getting hurt, or getting shot.

09:54.627 --> 09:57.266
A man's got to do what a
man's got to do. You got it?

10:01.415 --> 10:05.117
He really misses Robie.

10:09.952 --> 10:11.257
Hey, George.

10:11.652 --> 10:13.505
Hey. What'd he say? How'd it go?

10:13.557 --> 10:15.131
- It didn't.
- What are you talking about?

10:15.132 --> 10:16.779
Dr. Fields canceled an
appointment to take him!

10:16.780 --> 10:18.153
Very nice of him.

10:18.766 --> 10:21.387
- Did you walk Jack up to the office?
- No.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.035
- He didn't show up.
- What?

10:23.036 --> 10:24.345
I let him out right in
front of the building.

10:24.346 --> 10:25.813
I saw him get on the elevator!

10:25.814 --> 10:27.300
You should have got on
the elevator with him

10:27.301 --> 10:28.586
and walked him up to the office.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.095
Should I have gone in
and talked for him, too?

10:30.096 --> 10:31.897
I told you, you can't make him get help.

10:31.898 --> 10:33.658
Dadgum it! I can make him get help!

10:33.659 --> 10:34.743
I wish.

10:35.432 --> 10:36.602
I wish you could.

10:37.908 --> 10:39.366
How did he do last night at your house?

10:39.367 --> 10:40.692
He slept fine, he seemed fine.

10:40.693 --> 10:42.333
He was reluctant to go
but he said he would go.

10:42.334 --> 10:44.481
- You're sure he slept?
- I'm sure he slept!

10:44.482 --> 10:46.819
- Where did he sleep?
- He slept in my bed.

10:47.642 --> 10:49.727
All right, he slept in my
bed with me, but he slept!

10:49.728 --> 10:51.242
And he promised me he was
going to talk to Dr. Fields

10:51.243 --> 10:52.932
- and I'm going to hold him to it!
- Good.

10:53.715 --> 10:54.790
Good for you.

10:55.702 --> 10:57.924
Sometimes it's easier for
someone who isn't the parent

10:57.925 --> 10:59.591
to get a kid to do
something they should do.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.730
I just hate to see him
so messed up like this.

11:02.548 --> 11:03.809
I hate to see the bad guy win.

11:03.810 --> 11:04.888
Yeah, me, too.

11:06.444 --> 11:10.180
I've always been afraid he'd
get hurt playing ball. This...

11:11.752 --> 11:13.355
I never saw this coming.

11:15.472 --> 11:18.283
I miss those days when
he was just a little kid

11:18.284 --> 11:20.837
and he'd reach up and grab
my hand when he was scared.

11:22.176 --> 11:24.421
And there was something I
could actually do about it.

11:26.000 --> 11:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:24.926 --> 12:25.980
- Hi, Amy.
- Hey.

12:25.981 --> 12:29.066
I just called the nursery.
They said they sent John home?

12:29.290 --> 12:30.987
You called the nursery
before you called me?

12:30.988 --> 12:33.378
Did I check on our son
before I checked on you? Yes.

12:33.379 --> 12:34.774
He bit a kid.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.467
The kid bit him first, but
that kid was only two, so...

12:37.468 --> 12:38.833
What? John's not a biter.

12:38.834 --> 12:40.874
Guess John was feeling
a little angry today.

12:40.875 --> 12:42.643
What? Because I left?

12:42.644 --> 12:43.962
I didn't say that.

12:44.345 --> 12:45.678
The other kid bit him first.

12:45.679 --> 12:46.829
You didn't say that, either.

12:46.830 --> 12:48.720
- I thought I did.
- Okay.

12:49.095 --> 12:50.438
I know Ben was on the plane.

12:50.439 --> 12:52.223
And I know you sat next to Omar.

12:52.224 --> 12:53.554
I got a text. From Ben.

12:53.555 --> 12:54.772
He is so immature.

12:54.773 --> 12:56.692
- Ben or Omar?
- Ben!

12:59.166 --> 13:01.759
Omar, he got this really great job. He's...

13:01.760 --> 13:04.343
I know. Adrian told me,
I've already heard about it.

13:04.344 --> 13:06.354
- Good for him.
- Yeah. Good for him.

13:06.355 --> 13:08.546
And so, how is it?

13:08.547 --> 13:09.535
Uh... the school?

13:09.536 --> 13:10.885
That's what you're there for, right?

13:10.886 --> 13:12.510
Yeah, that's what I'm here for.

13:12.511 --> 13:13.665
Hey, shouldn't you be at work?

13:13.666 --> 13:16.166
I couldn't work today and
I couldn't go to class today

13:16.167 --> 13:18.283
because I had to take care of John today.

13:19.206 --> 13:21.615
So, what do you think?

13:21.616 --> 13:24.940
I think it's nice to be
here for, like, a day or two,

13:24.941 --> 13:28.698
but obviously I can't go to school
here and leave John with you.

13:29.419 --> 13:30.958
That just wouldn't work out.

13:30.959 --> 13:32.726
And I think we both can see that.

13:32.727 --> 13:35.344
Can we? And what does that mean?

13:35.345 --> 13:39.784
It means that I'll, uh,
I'll find a school out there.

13:40.859 --> 13:42.884
- Okay.
- Or, you know,

13:42.950 --> 13:45.265
there is daycare available to us

13:45.266 --> 13:48.846
through that teen program
I was in, here, in New York.

13:48.847 --> 13:50.697
Why don't you check it
out while you're there?

13:50.698 --> 13:53.135
I kind of did. I stopped by there today.

13:53.136 --> 13:55.741
It was on the way back to,
uh, to where I was going.

13:55.742 --> 13:57.917
All right, we'll talk
about it when you get home.

13:58.008 --> 14:00.282
- You want to talk to John?
- Yeah, of course.

14:01.016 --> 14:03.904
John, Mommy's on the phone.
Want to talk to Mommy?

14:04.051 --> 14:04.890
No.

14:05.559 --> 14:07.415
- Talk to Mommy.
- Hey, John.

14:07.416 --> 14:09.366
- Say, "I love you."
- I love you.

14:09.367 --> 14:10.406
I love you, too, buddy.

14:10.407 --> 14:11.588
Say, "I miss you, Mommy."

14:11.589 --> 14:13.050
I miss you, Mommy.

14:18.016 --> 14:19.642
- He's gone.
- All right.

14:20.702 --> 14:23.030
Uh... well, I'll be...
I'll be home late tomorrow.

14:23.031 --> 14:24.352
- Will you?
- Yeah.

14:24.353 --> 14:27.833
Okay, well, if you decide
to stay longer, let me know.

14:27.834 --> 14:28.774
Okay.

14:41.779 --> 14:43.900
Hi. Hate to pull you out of class,

14:43.901 --> 14:46.019
but the couple who adopted the baby,

14:46.031 --> 14:48.340
they're trying to reach
you. Sonya called the office.

14:48.341 --> 14:49.545
Because...

14:49.546 --> 14:50.883
Because she's called
your grandmother's house,

14:50.884 --> 14:53.310
and she tried you on your
cell and she couldn't get you

14:53.580 --> 14:54.916
and she needs to talk to you.

14:54.917 --> 14:56.935
All right. Is the baby okay?

14:56.936 --> 14:59.161
I don't know, Kathy, she
just wants you to call her.

15:05.431 --> 15:07.336
My boyfriend called the baby's mom and dad.

15:07.337 --> 15:08.124
What does that mean?

15:08.125 --> 15:09.948
He said he wants to see the baby.

15:09.949 --> 15:12.409
Oh. Can he do that?

15:12.410 --> 15:14.248
I don't know. He signed the papers.

15:14.249 --> 15:16.401
He said she could be adopted, but...

15:17.029 --> 15:19.041
he just wants to see her.

15:20.576 --> 15:22.716
He had said he didn't want
to be involved in any way.

15:22.717 --> 15:23.514
He didn't want to see her,

15:23.515 --> 15:25.727
he never wanted to see me again and now...

15:25.728 --> 15:26.852
You need to call your parents.

15:26.853 --> 15:28.170
My parents went out of the country.

15:28.171 --> 15:29.599
They're in France buying a horse.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.331
I'm sure you can reach them.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.403
And until you do, I'm sure your
grandmother will know what to do.

15:34.404 --> 15:37.531
Yeah, but I don't want to
bother her with this today.

15:37.553 --> 15:38.918
She has a friend who needs her today.

15:38.919 --> 15:40.757
She's at the hospital with her friend.

15:41.578 --> 15:43.280
So I'm just going to go home

15:43.281 --> 15:45.381
and Ethan is going to come home with me

15:45.382 --> 15:47.113
and we're going to do algebra.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.215
And I'll think about this tomorrow.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.219
If there's anything I can do...

15:51.220 --> 15:52.188
Thanks.

15:59.132 --> 16:01.164
- Are you in trouble?
- Huh?

16:01.165 --> 16:02.712
You got called out by the counselor.

16:02.713 --> 16:06.471
Oh, yeah. She just wanted
to ask me something about

16:06.472 --> 16:08.648
running for class office next year,

16:08.787 --> 16:11.654
as a way of meeting more people
and being more social. That's all.

16:11.655 --> 16:14.591
Uh, that's not all. What's going on?

16:14.788 --> 16:15.819
That's what's going on.

16:15.820 --> 16:17.727
No, that's not what's going on.

16:17.728 --> 16:19.116
Oh, you're not going to tell me again

16:19.117 --> 16:22.129
about your magical powers of
reading people's faces, are you?

16:22.743 --> 16:24.944
The baby daddy called the adoptive couple.

16:25.476 --> 16:27.112
He wants to see the baby.

16:27.161 --> 16:28.717
It's my worst nightmare come true.

16:28.718 --> 16:30.744
- How dare he!
- I know.

16:30.745 --> 16:32.711
- I hate him.
- Did you call him?

16:32.734 --> 16:34.235
Call him, tell him to knock it off.

16:34.236 --> 16:35.186
I don't want to call him.

16:35.187 --> 16:36.594
Yeah, but you're going to have to call him.

16:36.595 --> 16:38.228
Why is he doing this? Why now?

16:38.229 --> 16:41.005
- I don't know.
- Oh. I bet I know.

16:41.006 --> 16:43.418
- You know?
- I bet he heard you have a boyfriend.

16:43.419 --> 16:44.898
You think that could be it?

16:44.899 --> 16:46.705
Why would he care if I have a boyfriend?

16:46.706 --> 16:48.297
Cause guys are like that.

16:49.059 --> 16:50.391
Did you tell Ethan what's going on?

16:50.392 --> 16:51.842
I haven't had a chance.

16:52.758 --> 16:54.419
And when I do have a chance,

16:55.047 --> 16:56.465
I don't know if I'm going to tell him

16:56.737 --> 16:59.152
because he's not going to like it and...

16:59.740 --> 17:02.486
things are just getting
back to normal, you know?

17:02.775 --> 17:04.338
I'm no longer the teen mom.

17:04.339 --> 17:08.192
I'm just his girlfriend
and he's my boyfriend

17:09.296 --> 17:10.820
and I don't want to go
back to being a teen mom

17:10.821 --> 17:14.362
who has problems with the baby
and the boyfriend and all that.

17:14.704 --> 17:16.497
Sooner or later, he's
going to want a normal girl.

17:16.498 --> 17:19.384
What? He's totally in love with you.

17:19.512 --> 17:23.252
He went to Texas to beg your
father to let you stay here.

17:23.252 --> 17:26.977
He's not going to dump you, if
that's what you're afraid of.

17:29.587 --> 17:31.310
Hey, Ethan.

17:31.877 --> 17:33.918
See ya, Ethan.

17:34.054 --> 17:34.960
Call me.

17:38.407 --> 17:40.844
So what were you doing in the
counselor's office so long?

17:40.845 --> 17:42.770
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

17:42.771 --> 17:45.312
I was just looking at some
options for next year's classes.

17:45.313 --> 17:47.540
Are there options? It's public school.

17:47.541 --> 17:49.821
It's a magnet school and
there are advanced classes.

17:49.822 --> 17:50.991
There are choices.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.245
So are you walking home with me?

17:53.246 --> 17:54.363
I guess I am.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.756
Thanks, I really appreciate it

17:56.757 --> 17:58.521
and so does my grandmother.

17:58.596 --> 18:00.325
I'll try to make the tutoring session fun.

18:00.326 --> 18:01.484
But not too fun.

18:01.485 --> 18:03.855
Nothing that would give
any indication to anyone

18:03.856 --> 18:05.791
that I really can't be trusted.

18:10.361 --> 18:12.353
Um... everything okay?

18:12.641 --> 18:14.136
Yeah, why do you ask?

18:14.156 --> 18:17.860
'Cause I'm losing circulation in my hand.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.094
Oops. Sorry.

18:24.636 --> 18:26.628
Hey, you know, Ricky's
not working this afternoon

18:26.629 --> 18:29.110
and I know you were
missing the butcher shop.

18:29.111 --> 18:31.889
Care to, uh, go over and
give Bunny a little help?

18:31.890 --> 18:33.028
Where's Ricky?

18:33.098 --> 18:34.374
Home with the kid.

18:34.375 --> 18:37.425
He bit some kid or some
kid bit him or something.

18:37.426 --> 18:39.057
- John?
- Yeah. John.

18:39.058 --> 18:42.004
Huh. He's probably angry that

18:42.005 --> 18:44.600
his mommy is in New
York with someone's son.

18:44.601 --> 18:45.935
He got into school there.

18:45.936 --> 18:48.078
He gets to go spend a weekend on campus

18:48.079 --> 18:50.414
before he signs on the dotted line.

18:50.444 --> 18:53.763
I doubt he even knew if
Amy was on that flight.

18:53.764 --> 18:54.789
Coincidence.

18:54.790 --> 18:57.009
Oh, I don't think so.

18:57.116 --> 19:00.026
I think someone found
out what flight she was on

19:00.027 --> 19:02.964
and booked a ticket hoping to
get the two of them back together.

19:02.965 --> 19:04.502
I just gave you a raise.

19:04.503 --> 19:06.490
Are you spending the time
you're supposed to be working

19:06.491 --> 19:08.419
coming up with conspiracy theories?

19:08.420 --> 19:11.275
I did not send Ben to
New York to be with Amy.

19:11.276 --> 19:13.980
Truthfully, I don't
want him to be with Amy.

19:13.981 --> 19:18.353
She's a nice girl, but too
much water under the bridge.

19:18.674 --> 19:20.898
Are you going to the butcher shop or not?

19:20.899 --> 19:22.893
- Yeah, I'll go.
- Go.

19:23.067 --> 19:23.948
I'm going.

19:23.949 --> 19:25.613
- You want bus fare?
- What?

19:25.614 --> 19:27.824
In addition to that raise? Nah.

19:27.825 --> 19:30.207
Hopefully I'll get there
before closing time.

19:30.208 --> 19:33.590
Just joking. The driver will take you over.

19:33.591 --> 19:35.386
Bye. And thank you for that.

19:35.387 --> 19:36.283
Goodbye.

19:37.387 --> 19:39.002
Oh. While you're over there,

19:39.003 --> 19:41.124
why don't you pick up one
of those little pamphlets

19:41.125 --> 19:43.855
on our restaurant supply
and take it home to George.

19:43.856 --> 19:46.098
Oh. Sneaky.

19:46.099 --> 19:47.713
I've been wanting that account for years.

19:47.714 --> 19:51.183
I've got every restaurant in
this part of town but that one

19:51.184 --> 19:53.050
and no matter how many steaks I ate there,

19:53.051 --> 19:55.776
I could never get that
Geoff to do business with me.

19:57.615 --> 19:58.779
Feel out George, will you?

19:58.779 --> 20:01.428
All right, Leo. I will see what I can do.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.320
Hey, there you are!

20:18.321 --> 20:20.028
- Here I am.
- You ready to go?

20:20.029 --> 20:23.392
- Yeah.
- Okay, but, um, first...

20:24.297 --> 20:26.878
You know when you asked
me for a ride this morning

20:26.879 --> 20:30.846
and all the way here we talked
about how great Dr. Fields is?

20:30.847 --> 20:33.291
- Yeah.
- You didn't see Dr. Fields.

20:33.292 --> 20:35.265
Grace called me looking for you.

20:38.146 --> 20:40.732
- You shot George Juergens?
- I missed.

20:40.733 --> 20:42.346
Why can you not accept that you need help?

20:42.347 --> 20:44.535
Why can't anyone accept the
fact that I don't need help

20:44.536 --> 20:47.498
when I've got all the help I
need in Jesus Christ our Lord?

20:47.711 --> 20:49.152
I'm fine.

20:49.153 --> 20:50.000
And I don't want to talk

20:50.001 --> 20:51.931
to a shrink who doesn't
even believe in God.

20:51.932 --> 20:52.894
How do you know?

20:54.201 --> 20:55.806
All right, let me ask you something.

20:57.562 --> 21:00.410
Do you think your dad
stopped each of the surgeons

21:00.411 --> 21:01.725
going into the operating room

21:01.726 --> 21:03.782
to ask them if they were Christians or not?

21:04.193 --> 21:04.842
Or do you think that

21:04.843 --> 21:06.274
your dad didn't care
if they were Christians,

21:06.275 --> 21:06.864
because he just wanted to

21:06.865 --> 21:08.391
get the best help that he could get for you

21:08.392 --> 21:09.804
no matter what religion they were?

21:09.805 --> 21:13.164
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do. You know.

21:13.442 --> 21:16.778
Look, Jack, you got your
physical health covered,

21:16.779 --> 21:18.776
you got help with that,

21:18.777 --> 21:21.715
and you've definitely got
the spiritual help covered,

21:22.539 --> 21:24.412
how about you get your
mental health covered?

21:24.413 --> 21:26.318
I don't believe in mental health.

21:26.601 --> 21:29.092
There's no such thing as mental health.

21:29.114 --> 21:31.143
There's no mental, it's intangible.

21:31.144 --> 21:33.334
I have a brain and my brain is fine.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.932
Okay. I get the logic. But...

21:37.363 --> 21:38.681
How about this?

21:39.128 --> 21:42.848
How about love is intangible.

21:43.390 --> 21:45.505
You believe in love, don't you?

21:46.293 --> 21:47.935
Love is real, isn't it?

21:48.902 --> 21:51.580
Jack, Grace loves you,

21:51.581 --> 21:54.974
your mom and dad love
you, your friends love you.

21:55.372 --> 21:56.891
Get some help.

21:56.892 --> 21:58.774
What are you so afraid of?

21:58.775 --> 22:00.144
Can I have a ride?

22:05.096 --> 22:07.924
Hey, I see Grandma left us some dinner.

22:10.475 --> 22:12.574
What is it? Is it hot?

22:12.575 --> 22:15.419
Looks like green corn
tamales and brisket tacos.

22:15.420 --> 22:17.761
We had brisket last night.
She used the leftovers.

22:17.762 --> 22:19.611
This is one of my favorites.

22:20.078 --> 22:22.106
It's not hot?

22:26.763 --> 22:28.842
Oh, that is good. That's really good.

22:28.843 --> 22:30.981
We should eat now, it'll
help you concentrate.

22:30.982 --> 22:33.112
All right. But we don't
really have to study.

22:33.113 --> 22:35.962
No, we have to study. I want
to study. I like to study.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.398
Oh, come on. No one likes to study.

22:37.399 --> 22:38.796
- No, I do.
- All right.

22:38.797 --> 22:42.708
So you'd rather study than, say, make out?

22:42.833 --> 22:45.615
We could maybe make out a little. Later.

22:45.616 --> 22:46.708
After we do our homework.

22:46.709 --> 22:48.218
All right, let's do our homework.

22:48.219 --> 22:49.818
And after my grandmother gets home.

22:49.819 --> 22:50.934
After your grandmother gets home?

22:50.935 --> 22:52.890
You know, so she doesn't lose trust in us.

22:57.908 --> 22:58.930
Oh, no.

22:59.282 --> 23:00.423
Who's that?

23:00.424 --> 23:03.276
That is my boyfriend.

23:03.277 --> 23:05.367
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

23:06.534 --> 23:08.442
I thought I was your boyfriend.

23:08.443 --> 23:10.186
- From Texas.
- What's he doing here?

23:10.187 --> 23:12.553
I think he wants to see the baby.

23:12.554 --> 23:13.750
Did you know he was coming?

23:13.751 --> 23:15.507
- No.
- I got it.

23:20.921 --> 23:22.433
Get the hell out of here.

23:23.244 --> 23:24.438
Kathy?

23:33.748 --> 23:36.158
Yes. Ethan is my boyfriend.

23:36.159 --> 23:37.382
Did Ethan get to see the baby?

23:37.383 --> 23:39.549
He was at the hospital, so, yeah.

23:40.624 --> 23:42.259
Do you really want to see the baby?

23:42.260 --> 23:43.199
It's been bugging me.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.176
So why didn't you call me before
you called Sonya and Jonathan?

23:46.177 --> 23:48.561
- They're really upset.
- I'm upset, too.

23:48.869 --> 23:50.963
I didn't find out you had the baby

23:50.964 --> 23:52.841
until some girl at school told me.

23:52.842 --> 23:55.658
- You didn't say you wanted to know.
- I wanted to know.

23:56.342 --> 23:58.244
Geez, Kathy, she's my baby, too.

23:58.245 --> 24:03.143
I know, but she's not
really your baby or my baby.

24:03.144 --> 24:05.200
She's their baby, they're adopting her.

24:05.201 --> 24:08.176
Not if I change my mind. You're
not going to change your mind.

24:09.695 --> 24:12.907
Come on, don't do this to
me, and to them, and to her.

24:12.908 --> 24:14.405
She's just an innocent baby.

24:14.406 --> 24:17.174
I just started thinking about it and...

24:18.547 --> 24:20.875
maybe she's the only baby I'll ever have.

24:20.876 --> 24:24.019
I doubt it, but I hope
the next one is planned

24:24.020 --> 24:25.609
and you're older and married.

24:25.610 --> 24:27.975
Yeah, me, too.

24:28.678 --> 24:30.454
It's not too late.

24:31.229 --> 24:34.143
We could still get married and
take care of her on our own.

24:34.144 --> 24:35.831
That would be selfish, wouldn't it?

24:36.219 --> 24:38.178
Two people who don't love each other,

24:38.179 --> 24:41.077
who are still in high
hool, trying to be parents?

24:41.319 --> 24:43.277
Don't you think she deserves better?

24:43.278 --> 24:44.896
And how would we support ourselves?

24:44.897 --> 24:46.652
How would either of us get a job?

24:46.653 --> 24:47.719
How would we finish school?

24:47.720 --> 24:49.115
How could we ever go to college?

24:49.116 --> 24:50.886
I'm not going to college anyway.

24:51.801 --> 24:53.260
I don't have the money.

24:54.707 --> 24:57.300
So I'm just going to get a job and...

24:57.301 --> 24:58.270
And what?

24:58.680 --> 25:01.254
I'm just going to drop out
of high school and stay home?

25:01.829 --> 25:04.672
We are not going to ask for the baby back!

25:13.404 --> 25:15.428
- What now?
- I got a little problem.

25:15.429 --> 25:16.729
Not a little problem.

25:16.730 --> 25:19.265
I'm busy here. Take care of
your own problems for once.

25:19.266 --> 25:22.399
You know, a lot of cultures
consider a 13-year-old a man

25:22.400 --> 25:25.599
and you're 15 now, so just
grow up and do the right thing.

25:25.600 --> 25:28.118
- I'm over at Kathy's...
- I told you not to go over there.

25:28.119 --> 25:30.289
- I know, but I did.
- And now what?

25:30.290 --> 25:33.088
Her old boyfriend showed
up, the baby's father.

25:33.089 --> 25:35.045
- What does he want?
- He wants to go see the baby.

25:35.046 --> 25:37.126
He wants to change his mind

25:37.127 --> 25:38.879
about the baby being adopted.

25:39.462 --> 25:40.758
At least that's what he's saying.

25:40.759 --> 25:41.682
Don't get in the middle.

25:41.683 --> 25:43.915
The middle would be a terrible place to be.

25:43.916 --> 25:45.949
I was thinking maybe
you could come over here

25:45.950 --> 25:48.008
and tell him how hard it is to be a father.

25:49.716 --> 25:52.963
I don't have time, I'm
too busy being a father.

25:52.964 --> 25:55.560
I'm cooking dinner and waiting
for John to get up from his nap,

25:55.561 --> 25:57.467
while I try to write a
paper that's due tomorrow

25:57.468 --> 25:59.651
and catch up online with
what I missed in class today.

25:59.652 --> 26:01.245
You could bring your computer with you.

26:01.246 --> 26:02.604
And John, of course.

26:02.605 --> 26:05.269
No, I'm not going to do
that. I can't do that.

26:05.270 --> 26:07.064
It would be impossible to do that.

26:07.078 --> 26:09.184
No one understands how difficult it is

26:09.185 --> 26:11.985
to be a father when you're a
teenager until they've done it.

26:11.986 --> 26:14.842
Hell, no one realizes how hard
it is to be a father, anyway,

26:14.843 --> 26:16.165
until you've done it.

26:16.166 --> 26:18.042
And I recommend you don't do it.

26:18.043 --> 26:19.526
So when this guy leaves,

26:19.527 --> 26:21.764
don't be fooling around with
Kathy in that empty house.

26:21.765 --> 26:23.033
Geez, you know, not every guy

26:23.034 --> 26:25.137
is thinking about sex
every minute of the day.

26:26.111 --> 26:28.322
All right some of us maybe, but...

26:28.323 --> 26:29.986
you know, I'm not completely insensitive.

26:29.987 --> 26:32.346
I don't think this would
be the time to approach her.

26:32.347 --> 26:34.725
I don't think high school would
be the time to approach her.

26:34.726 --> 26:36.346
- You just wait.
- You didn't.

26:36.347 --> 26:38.202
Right.
- Right...

26:39.812 --> 26:40.809
I have to go and

26:40.810 --> 26:43.724
I have to figure out the
right thing to do myself.

26:48.957 --> 26:50.447
Hey, how was scol today?

26:50.561 --> 26:51.769
It was school.

26:51.875 --> 26:53.803
I know. I'm supposed to ask you

26:53.804 --> 26:55.971
something more difficult to answer than,

26:55.972 --> 26:58.503
"How was school today?" If
I expect you to talk to me.

26:58.504 --> 26:59.946
I like talking to you.

26:59.947 --> 27:02.111
I just don't think you really
want to know how school was.

27:02.112 --> 27:03.424
You want to know about Ben?

27:03.425 --> 27:04.885
Ben and I have been texting.

27:05.118 --> 27:06.044
I don't know.

27:06.045 --> 27:08.587
I'm sure Ben would text me if
he wanted me to know anything.

27:08.588 --> 27:10.937
You know how he knew
Amy was on that flight?

27:10.938 --> 27:13.819
She printed out the ticket on one
of the computers in the library

27:13.820 --> 27:16.062
then copied it and left it in the machine.

27:16.063 --> 27:18.285
Ben did the same, saw she
was on a different flight,

27:18.286 --> 27:19.849
so he changed his.

27:19.999 --> 27:21.961
But Omar was a coincidence.

27:21.962 --> 27:26.638
But I think maybe Amy left that
copy in the machine on purpose.

27:26.639 --> 27:28.696
I think she wanted Ben to
know when she was going.

27:28.697 --> 27:29.649
Because?

27:29.650 --> 27:33.549
Because she likes to act all
independent and everything,

27:33.550 --> 27:35.354
going to school in New York and all that,

27:35.355 --> 27:37.275
but have you ever seen her without a guy?

27:37.276 --> 27:38.516
Even for a week?

27:38.517 --> 27:43.003
First it was Ben, then Ricky,
then Ben, then some weird guy,

27:43.004 --> 27:44.965
then Ben, then Ricky.

27:45.096 --> 27:46.666
She's never even been by herself.

27:46.667 --> 27:48.395
And where do you get your information?

27:48.559 --> 27:49.583
Ben.

27:50.075 --> 27:51.130
I should have known.

27:51.131 --> 27:52.680
Look, sweetie, Ben may not be the

27:52.681 --> 27:56.363
best judge of what happened
in his or Amy's life.

27:56.611 --> 27:58.697
I don't know why he can't let her go.

27:58.698 --> 28:00.484
I thought he turned around,

28:00.537 --> 28:03.287
but the idea that Amy would go to New York,

28:03.288 --> 28:04.679
possibly without Ricky,

28:04.680 --> 28:05.920
just set him off again.

28:05.921 --> 28:07.622
I think there's something
kind of sweet about it.

28:07.623 --> 28:09.008
Well, Amy and Ricky have a son.

28:09.009 --> 28:11.265
There is nothing sweet
about Ben pursuing Amy

28:11.266 --> 28:13.959
while she's on the fence about
what she wants with Ricky.

28:14.573 --> 28:15.725
I forgot about the kid.

28:15.726 --> 28:17.747
Yeah, well, you can't forget about the kid.

28:17.748 --> 28:19.155
Not if you have one.

28:19.389 --> 28:20.795
Even if you want to forget.

28:31.179 --> 28:32.668
So that's your boyfriend, huh?

28:59.471 --> 29:00.817
Going somewhere?

29:08.373 --> 29:10.554
Jack may be more comfortable
talking to me alone.

29:10.555 --> 29:12.197
I don't mind if he's here.

29:12.373 --> 29:13.807
I mind if he's here.

29:13.808 --> 29:15.190
Frankly, I want to hear
what you have to say to him.

29:15.191 --> 29:17.003
George, therapy is kind of personal.

29:17.004 --> 29:18.708
Not kind of, very.

29:18.709 --> 29:19.721
I've got nothing to hide.

29:19.722 --> 29:20.958
Yeah. He's got nothing to hide.

29:20.959 --> 29:22.919
And he's the one who dragged me in here.

29:23.131 --> 29:25.951
I don't know what good
any of this is going to do.

29:26.077 --> 29:28.606
I mean, do you mind if I
ask you a few questions?

29:28.607 --> 29:31.009
Okay, ask me anything you want, Jack.

29:31.010 --> 29:33.946
Do you believe that Jesus Christ
is the one and only son of God?

29:33.947 --> 29:35.588
I'd rather not answer that one, Jack.

29:35.589 --> 29:37.256
Then the answer is a "No."

29:37.396 --> 29:39.435
He thinks he's been miraculously healed.

29:39.436 --> 29:41.599
- Of what?
- Well, my bones are healed.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.147
The ones that are in
the casts or other bones?

29:44.148 --> 29:45.371
No, the ones in the casts.

29:45.372 --> 29:46.657
That's why I want to get the casts off.

29:46.658 --> 29:48.152
Because I don't even need them.

29:48.583 --> 29:49.943
And I'm getting really tired of them

29:49.944 --> 29:51.445
and I want to be able to work out again.

29:51.446 --> 29:54.362
And has God spoken to you, out loud,

29:54.363 --> 29:57.121
in a voice you can hear, telling
you that the bones have healed?

29:57.122 --> 29:58.187
I hear Him in my heart.

29:58.188 --> 30:02.960
And has God healed you of any
feelings of fear and anxiety

30:02.961 --> 30:04.499
following the attack?

30:04.500 --> 30:06.010
I know about the attack.

30:06.011 --> 30:08.446
Maybe. Um... I know something

30:08.447 --> 30:10.905
shifted inside right after I shot George.

30:10.906 --> 30:14.546
Something shifted for me inside,
too. Luckily not in my pants.

30:14.547 --> 30:15.338
He missed.

30:15.339 --> 30:18.184
Is that how the two of you came
to be in my office together?

30:18.185 --> 30:19.554
Because Jack tried to shoot you?

30:19.555 --> 30:21.018
Yeah. I dropped by the guest house,

30:21.019 --> 30:22.813
he didn't know I was coming... Blam.

30:22.814 --> 30:23.700
This is getting to be more

30:23.701 --> 30:25.577
like a reality show than a therapy session.

30:25.578 --> 30:27.322
Jack, tell me why you're here,

30:27.323 --> 30:31.550
other than he dragged you in
here after you tried to shoot him.

30:34.488 --> 30:35.516
I can't sleep.

30:35.517 --> 30:37.727
Tom's already told everyone so...

30:42.069 --> 30:44.756
I know the guy that did
this to me left the country,

30:44.803 --> 30:47.726
at least that's what the cops are saying,

30:48.986 --> 30:52.048
but I see his face everywhere I look.

30:53.592 --> 30:56.794
I'm scared.

30:57.314 --> 30:58.991
I'm too scared to sleep.

30:58.992 --> 31:02.982
That's not necessarily a
bad thing, being afraid.

31:03.155 --> 31:07.504
Fear is nature's way of
protecting us sometimes.

31:07.505 --> 31:10.134
- It alerts us to danger.
- Don't tell him that.

31:10.732 --> 31:13.354
What? Next thing you know he's
going to want his gun back.

31:13.355 --> 31:17.678
Even if I had the gun, that
guy could have a bigger gun.

31:18.482 --> 31:20.356
It's just that my confidence is shot.

31:20.357 --> 31:22.956
If that guy, or any
other guy, came after me,

31:22.957 --> 31:23.883
I couldn't fight him off.

31:23.884 --> 31:25.784
I've only got one good
leg and one good arm.

31:25.785 --> 31:28.536
And that's why you want to
believe the bones have healed,

31:28.879 --> 31:31.278
because you want the casts off.

31:31.428 --> 31:34.613
Because they make you feel vulnerable.

31:38.606 --> 31:39.999
Told you he was good.

31:41.294 --> 31:42.618
Could I talk to him alone?

31:42.619 --> 31:43.699
Sure, kid.

31:52.521 --> 31:53.642
- Come in.
- Thanks.

31:53.643 --> 31:54.784
What are you doing here?

31:54.900 --> 31:57.695
Oh, I was just helping out in
the butcher shop in your absence.

31:57.696 --> 31:59.756
I am so glad to see you. I am so tired.

31:59.757 --> 32:01.746
I am so happy to have an adult to talk to.

32:01.747 --> 32:04.155
- I've had John by myself all day.
- Make you want to drink?

32:04.156 --> 32:07.675
No. But I hadn't done an
entire night and day for a while

32:07.676 --> 32:10.914
and I'm a little out of
practice, and I'm stressed out...

32:10.915 --> 32:15.076
- Again, I'm really happy to see you.
- So what's for dinner?

32:15.077 --> 32:17.879
Meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Can you stay?

32:17.880 --> 32:19.204
If you give me a ride home.

32:19.610 --> 32:20.882
How can I give you a ride home?

32:20.883 --> 32:23.560
After dinner, I have to give John
a bath and then put him to bed.

32:23.561 --> 32:24.824
And then I can't just leave him here.

32:24.825 --> 32:27.624
I bet a ride in the car
would put him to sleep, huh?

32:27.955 --> 32:29.925
Maybe. I'm not promising anything.

32:29.926 --> 32:31.293
I got to get a car.

32:31.294 --> 32:33.180
You got to learn to drive
and get a license first.

32:33.181 --> 32:34.630
I do all right.

32:35.973 --> 32:39.915
You know, I could help you with John.

32:41.691 --> 32:43.716
I'm okay now. I'm doing really well.

32:43.717 --> 32:45.116
I could babysit in a pinch.

32:45.117 --> 32:46.226
Even not in a pinch.

32:46.227 --> 32:47.769
Amy will be back tomorrow.

32:47.770 --> 32:49.189
Yeah, okay.

32:49.361 --> 32:51.328
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

32:53.354 --> 32:57.336
I'm just looking at you and
thinking what a great kid you are.

32:58.125 --> 33:01.037
I'm not exactly a kid but
I appreciate the sentiment.

33:01.038 --> 33:03.414
You're not exactly a kid, you're a man.

33:05.118 --> 33:07.111
And you know, plenty of single dads are

33:09.072 --> 33:13.008
raising kids alone these days
without the help of anyone.

33:13.009 --> 33:14.559
Without the help of anyone?

33:14.909 --> 33:16.143
I doubt it.

33:16.241 --> 33:18.019
No one can raise a kid on their own

33:18.020 --> 33:19.732
without any help from anyone.

33:19.843 --> 33:22.076
And, again, Amy will be back tomorrow,

33:22.718 --> 33:24.984
unless you know something I don't?

33:24.985 --> 33:25.915
No.

33:26.067 --> 33:28.156
Well, yeah.

33:30.054 --> 33:31.369
I know I was very happy

33:31.370 --> 33:34.804
when you told me the
two of you were married

33:35.962 --> 33:38.155
and I was just as happy when you

33:38.894 --> 33:41.850
told me the two of you were not married.

33:41.966 --> 33:44.595
Because, uh, I'm just going to say this.

33:44.596 --> 33:46.712
I don't think you should marry Amy.

33:47.450 --> 33:49.901
Everyone seems so
concerned that she's only 18

33:49.902 --> 33:51.168
and she has her whole life ahead

33:51.169 --> 33:53.127
and what would her life

33:53.128 --> 33:55.643
be like if she didn't have a son with you.

33:56.488 --> 33:58.291
And, well, you're 19

33:59.027 --> 34:01.743
and you have your whole life ahead of you.

34:02.932 --> 34:05.828
So if you don't want to be
married then don't be married.

34:05.829 --> 34:07.184
I want to be married.

34:07.185 --> 34:08.342
Okay. I'm just saying...

34:08.344 --> 34:10.597
"Just"? Do you know what you said here?

34:10.598 --> 34:12.348
I'm just trying to protect you.

34:12.349 --> 34:14.518
- From what?
- I don't know.

34:15.985 --> 34:19.317
Life, I guess. I...

34:28.648 --> 34:31.409
- Maybe I won't stay for dinner, huh?
- Yeah. Maybe you shouldn't.

34:31.411 --> 34:32.295
Yeah.

34:48.672 --> 34:51.279
Hey! Look who's here!
Yeah, look who's here.

34:51.730 --> 34:54.761
I was going to come by
your fancy new restaurant

34:54.762 --> 34:57.197
but I went to a meeting instead.

34:57.198 --> 34:59.933
Just felt like an extra one
this week for some reason.

34:59.934 --> 35:01.442
- Willowdine there?
- Oh.

35:01.443 --> 35:03.476
I haven't seen much of her lately.

35:03.477 --> 35:05.670
Guess she's spending some
time down in Palm Springs.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.631
- Wouldn't know.
- Neither would I.

35:07.705 --> 35:09.756
So, where are the boys?

35:09.757 --> 35:10.703
Well, Tom went to bed

35:10.704 --> 35:12.273
and Jack is staying over at
his parents' house tonight.

35:12.274 --> 35:15.276
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, he spent some time with Dr. Fields.

35:15.277 --> 35:17.492
He's feeling a lot better. A lot.

35:17.493 --> 35:19.580
Good! Ah! Good for him!

35:19.581 --> 35:21.487
- Yeah.
- And good for you.

35:21.488 --> 35:22.728
'Cause I know you probably

35:22.729 --> 35:24.401
had a little something to do with that.

35:24.402 --> 35:25.370
Not really.

35:25.384 --> 35:28.477
Hey, I, uh, I brought you
home a steak and a baked potato

35:28.478 --> 35:29.874
in case you hadn't eaten.

35:31.615 --> 35:33.753
That is mighty thoughtful
of you. Thank you.

35:33.754 --> 35:34.713
I have not eaten.

35:34.714 --> 35:37.326
Of course, it's not Boykewich
beef, it's from the restaurant.

35:37.327 --> 35:41.440
Oh. I, uh, took the liberty of bringing you

35:41.441 --> 35:42.926
one of our little brochures

35:42.927 --> 35:46.006
on, you know, restaurant
supplies and costs and all that,

35:46.007 --> 35:49.792
just in case you ever think
about, you know, switching over.

35:49.805 --> 35:51.014
Yeah, okay, why not?

35:51.015 --> 35:53.154
Did I just sell you on our services?

35:53.155 --> 35:54.611
Ricky already asked me.

35:54.746 --> 35:56.434
He got me some prices this afternoon

35:56.435 --> 35:59.353
and called me between
laundry and dinner and naps.

35:59.408 --> 36:02.498
Well. Good. Good for him.

36:02.579 --> 36:03.706
That Ricky is a go-getter.

36:03.707 --> 36:05.788
- Yep. He's a good man.
- He is.

36:07.218 --> 36:10.899
You know, I got a feeling, someday soon,

36:10.900 --> 36:12.627
Anne is going to make us move from here.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.183
Anne's not going to make us do anything.

36:14.184 --> 36:16.377
She's angry, but, hey, so am I.

36:16.378 --> 36:18.589
No one seems to appreciate what I did so...

36:18.590 --> 36:20.210
I'm going to get some new people in my life

36:20.211 --> 36:22.523
and stop wasting m my
tie worrying about Annee

36:22.524 --> 36:24.099
or being afraid of what she might do.

36:24.100 --> 36:26.817
Well, you've got someplace to
go. You've got Kathleen's house.

36:27.053 --> 36:28.428
You are going to get married, right?

36:28.429 --> 36:30.504
Right. Very much looking forward to it.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.488
You've been a really
good friend to me, George.

36:34.770 --> 36:39.509
And, well, it's probably time
for me to move out anyway.

36:39.511 --> 36:40.567
You got a place to go?

36:40.568 --> 36:42.758
- I've been saving my money.
- For a car.

36:42.759 --> 36:44.672
Yeah, thought I'd do that first,

36:44.673 --> 36:46.117
but maybe I'll get an apartment first.

36:46.118 --> 36:47.025
Well...

36:47.641 --> 36:49.539
I thought you were afraid of living alone.

36:49.961 --> 36:51.900
Afraid that you might start drinking again.

36:51.901 --> 36:53.850
Guess I should to deal with that sometime,

36:53.851 --> 36:55.167
might as well be now.

36:55.831 --> 36:57.939
I was just thinking on the bus over here,

36:58.807 --> 37:00.273
"I'm going to start looking."

37:00.975 --> 37:01.908
All right.

37:02.472 --> 37:03.406
All right.

37:13.889 --> 37:16.659
- Is he gone?
- Yeah, finally.

37:17.601 --> 37:19.957
Sorry about that. We should
get started on our homework.

37:19.958 --> 37:21.724
Uh, not so fast.

37:21.725 --> 37:23.356
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

37:23.357 --> 37:28.310
It's just all a part of, you
know, that thing I went through.

37:28.311 --> 37:30.366
That "thing" you went through?

37:31.123 --> 37:33.809
Giving life to a human being at 15

37:33.810 --> 37:37.458
and then sacrificing any and
all desires to be with the baby

37:37.459 --> 37:39.234
because you know she's in the best place,

37:39.235 --> 37:40.755
even if it's ripping your heart out?

37:40.756 --> 37:43.241
It's not. It's not ripping my heart out.

37:43.242 --> 37:44.729
I'm okay with my decision.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.321
Doesn't mean it was an easy decision.

37:46.322 --> 37:48.204
I'm okay! Can we stop talking about it?

37:48.205 --> 37:49.764
Stop talking about it?

37:49.968 --> 37:53.500
This is huge, your
boyfriend showing up here.

37:54.307 --> 37:55.471
Did you know he was coming?

37:55.472 --> 37:56.989
No, I didn't.

37:57.039 --> 37:58.283
I knew he called them,

37:58.284 --> 38:00.479
I just didn't know he
was going to show up here.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.418
Is this why you were in
the counselor's office?

38:02.419 --> 38:04.756
Yes. Sonya was trying to reach me.

38:04.757 --> 38:06.517
I just didn't want to tell you.

38:06.518 --> 38:09.147
- Why not?
- Because I don't like talking about it.

38:09.198 --> 38:11.031
I don't like talking about the baby

38:11.032 --> 38:12.923
or anything to do with the baby.

38:13.584 --> 38:15.266
It's not that I don't care about her.

38:15.267 --> 38:17.523
I'll always, always care about her

38:17.524 --> 38:19.446
and what happens to her, but...

38:20.923 --> 38:23.114
This is going to sound
completely selfish and stupid.

38:23.115 --> 38:24.391
Say it.

38:25.420 --> 38:29.387
There's nothing so selfish and
stupid you can't say it to me.

38:29.553 --> 38:30.394
I love you.

38:30.395 --> 38:33.697
And I love you. What's the
stupid and selfish thing

38:33.698 --> 38:34.683
you can't say to me?

38:34.684 --> 38:37.963
- I love you.
- No, what's the selfish and stupid...

38:41.023 --> 38:42.474
Oh. That.

38:42.896 --> 38:44.877
That you love me.

38:46.767 --> 38:48.845
How is that stupid or selfish?

38:48.846 --> 38:52.986
Because I should be focusing on
saving my child from any harm,

38:52.987 --> 38:54.911
not worried that you're
going to break up with me.

38:54.912 --> 38:56.369
Why would I break up with you?

38:56.370 --> 38:58.666
Because your life is already complicated.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.131
Why would you want more complications

39:01.132 --> 39:03.819
like a girlfriend with
an ongoing baby drama?

39:04.147 --> 39:06.498
You're the one who's stupid, you know that?

39:07.322 --> 39:10.241
I don't care if my life is more complicated

39:10.242 --> 39:12.194
because of you and who you are.

39:13.761 --> 39:16.690
You're also the sweetest girl I ever met.

39:26.339 --> 39:28.408
So Don Juan wants to take the baby?

39:28.409 --> 39:29.783
He says he does, yeah.

39:29.784 --> 39:32.132
Yeah, well, he doesn't.

39:32.133 --> 39:33.820
No, unfortunately he does.

39:33.821 --> 39:35.339
I don't know anything about algebra,

39:35.340 --> 39:38.386
and I'm definitely not learning
anything about algebra tonight,

39:38.387 --> 39:41.626
but I do know about people

39:41.973 --> 39:44.766
and that guy is not looking
to take a baby home with him.

39:44.767 --> 39:47.906
Ethan, he's determined to see the baby

39:47.993 --> 39:52.097
and he wants to take h,
her and me, back to Texas.

39:52.466 --> 39:54.325
No, that's what he said.

39:54.326 --> 39:57.051
I don't care what he
said, that guy is a liar.

39:57.052 --> 39:58.001
I don't think so.

39:58.002 --> 39:59.529
You didn't think so
when he lied to you about

39:59.530 --> 40:01.510
the foolproof birth control, either.

40:02.389 --> 40:03.510
No, I didn't.

40:03.511 --> 40:05.653
And he's not a nerd, by the way.

40:05.654 --> 40:07.410
- Yes, he is.
- No.

40:07.699 --> 40:10.952
I was expecting this wimpy,
unattractive intellectual

40:10.953 --> 40:12.758
and that's hardly the case.

40:12.759 --> 40:14.293
Oh, please, he's a nerd.

40:14.294 --> 40:17.085
He thinks he's slick, he's
trying to pull a fast one.

40:17.086 --> 40:19.563
He doesn't want to be a father
and mess up his sex life.

40:19.564 --> 40:21.752
He hasn't had sex since we had sex.

40:23.502 --> 40:28.319
No, he's after something
and it's not the baby.

40:29.972 --> 40:31.433
And it's not you.

40:45.834 --> 40:48.313
- You just get in?
- No, no, I've been in for hours.

40:48.314 --> 40:50.489
- I just can't sleep.
- Oh? And why is that?

40:50.490 --> 40:51.580
I don't know.

40:51.581 --> 40:53.258
Something bothering you?

40:53.259 --> 40:56.605
Yeah. Something is.

40:56.995 --> 40:59.429
I just, uh... I don't know how to say it.

40:59.430 --> 41:01.957
Then just say it, Amy, just say it.

41:03.011 --> 41:05.528
I'm just afraid of losing you, Ricky.

41:06.469 --> 41:08.059
I don't want to lose you.

41:17.195 --> 41:19.015
Come in, it's open.

41:20.990 --> 41:24.874
Hi, Ben. What's going on?

41:25.106 --> 41:27.238
Packing. It's too loud in here.

41:27.239 --> 41:28.580
There's no way I'm going to get any sleep.

41:28.581 --> 41:29.525
Where are you going?

41:29.526 --> 41:32.184
To the nicest hotel
suite that I can get into.

41:32.185 --> 41:33.570
That sounds good.

41:33.747 --> 41:35.560
Bebe's going to party all night

41:35.561 --> 41:37.129
but I'm not sure I'm into it.

41:37.331 --> 41:39.342
I want to look halfway decent
for my interview tomorrow.

41:39.343 --> 41:42.028
You can come with me and
share a suite if you want to.

41:44.257 --> 41:48.917
So, did Dr. Fields have any
idea how long it might take

41:48.918 --> 41:51.102
before Jack is feeling
a little more secure?

41:51.103 --> 41:55.120
No, but this is progress, real progress.

41:55.373 --> 41:57.757
I'm just relieved he's
finally able to talk.

41:57.758 --> 42:00.830
Yeah, but still...
