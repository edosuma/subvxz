02:06.826 --> 02:10.595
oh, Archie.
It's 2:15 in the morning.

02:10.662 --> 02:12.831
What are you doing up ?

02:12.898 --> 02:16.500
I'm playin' musical
milk bottles here, Edith.

02:16.568 --> 02:19.771
How come you got
three bottles here,
and between them all,

02:19.839 --> 02:23.007
a man can't get one
full glass of milk ?

02:23.075 --> 02:26.845
I-I guess it's because
we don't finish one bottle
all the way...

02:26.912 --> 02:29.948
Before we open
the next.

02:30.015 --> 02:32.951
I guess that must be it,
Edith.

02:34.553 --> 02:37.488
You know,
it's the little things
that torture a person.

02:37.556 --> 02:40.691
You haven't been
to sleep yet.

02:40.760 --> 02:45.496
Even in bed,
you didn't sleep.
How did you know that ?

02:45.564 --> 02:48.900
Because when you sleep,
you snore and kick,

02:48.968 --> 02:52.036
and when it's very quiet
and I'm not gettin' hurt much,

02:52.104 --> 02:55.173
I know you ain't asleep.

02:58.510 --> 03:00.711
Is there something
on your mind ?

03:00.780 --> 03:04.048
Edith, I just got
a little simple indigestion,
that's all.

03:04.116 --> 03:07.018
Did you eat something
that didn't agree with you ?

03:07.086 --> 03:09.788
Only your dinner, Edith.

03:15.060 --> 03:17.862
I thought I heard
voices down here.
What's going on ?

03:17.930 --> 03:19.864
"What's going on ?"

03:19.932 --> 03:23.334
Your mother-in-law and me
are runnin' away together.

03:23.402 --> 03:26.737
What's bugging you ?
I just never seen you up
this late, that's all.

03:26.806 --> 03:29.607
Well, it don't need
no big explanation.

How come everybody's up ?

03:41.921 --> 03:44.689
Now, look at this.
Will you answer me.

03:44.756 --> 03:48.860
Can't youse two get
a second pair of pajamas ?

03:51.263 --> 03:55.033
Or would that destroy
something beautiful
in your marriage ?

03:55.100 --> 03:57.702
I'm not even awake yet,
and he's picking.

03:57.769 --> 04:00.905
Yeah, because
it ain't decent

- Archie, they're married.
- So are we married.

04:04.609 --> 04:08.379
And we go to bed
fully dressed.

04:08.447 --> 04:11.216

Somethin' bothering him ?

04:18.390 --> 04:20.892
Oh, I thought so,
but he said no,

04:20.959 --> 04:22.894

Archie ?

something on your mind.

We want to help you.
You wanna help me with
something that troubles me ?

Would you put something
on yourself and make
yourself respectable.

was any shorter,
it'd be a scarf.

Come on, Gloria, let's go.
We get enough of that talk
during the day.

something ?

Only if it was something
that makes me mad, Edith.

06:54.413 --> 06:56.981

about your job ?

Tell me, what is it ?
Edith, it's nothing.

07:04.390 --> 07:06.324
It's just that, uh,

07:06.392 --> 07:10.694
well, the company announced
that they're having a 20 percent
cutback in personnel.

07:10.762 --> 07:14.465
That's all.
I think it's gonna hit
my department pretty hard.

Oh, Archie.

07:16.435 --> 07:19.370
Hold it, hold it, Edith.
I ain't worried about it.

07:19.438 --> 07:22.306
Take it easy.
You know me.

07:22.374 --> 07:25.910
I could get another job
in ten minutes,
if it came to that.

07:25.977 --> 07:29.414
It's just, uh, it's just
some of the other guys
I work with, that's all.

07:29.481 --> 07:31.449
I'm worried about them.

07:31.517 --> 07:35.153
Like there's little Emanuel.
He's puerto rican.

under me for a lot of years,

Day after tomorrow they're
gonna come out with a list
of who gets the ax.

makin' his rounds,
punching his clocks,

he's gonna poke around
in the executive offices...

08:28.373 --> 08:30.374
And try and get
the scoop first.

It's about his company
cutting back personnel.

09:10.249 --> 09:13.351
That's why he can't sleep
tonight, isn't it ?

09:14.819 --> 09:16.854
Oh, yeah.

13:32.844 --> 13:36.680
You take it.
Edith, come over here,
will ya.

13:36.748 --> 13:39.884
I don't like it at all
that feeney ain't called.

13:39.951 --> 13:42.185
I'm kinda worried.
Oh, Archie.

13:42.253 --> 13:45.456
Could I get you some toast
and a cup of coffee ?

13:45.524 --> 13:47.792
No, nothin' like that.

13:47.859 --> 13:50.294
How 'bout
some poached eggs ?

13:50.361 --> 13:54.364
Edith, the answer
to every problem
ain't somethin' to eat.

13:55.767 --> 13:58.702
I couldn't hold nothin'
on my stomach anyhow.

13:58.770 --> 14:02.406
Oh, Archie,
don't worry.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.975
Even if worse
comes to worst,

14:05.043 --> 14:07.311
remember our mothers
and fathers.

14:07.378 --> 14:10.948
They lived through
the big depression,
and they made it.

14:12.951 --> 14:16.887
I'll never forget
the way it hit my old man.

14:16.955 --> 14:20.591
There he was,
a breadwinner all them years,

14:20.659 --> 14:23.160
and then-- and then
just like that,

14:23.227 --> 14:25.663
the paychecks,
they stopped coming.

14:25.730 --> 14:29.834
Why ?
He was always asking,
"why ?"

14:29.901 --> 14:34.104
And nobody could tell him.
It was awful.

14:34.172 --> 14:36.340
Oh, yeah,
sure it was, Archie,

14:36.407 --> 14:38.342
but look at you.

14:38.409 --> 14:40.911
You came through it
real good.

14:40.979 --> 14:44.414
Edith, gee,
I was only a kid.

14:46.017 --> 14:48.352
My old man
never got over it.

14:49.654 --> 14:52.189
Took the heart
right out of him.

14:53.424 --> 14:56.426
And he wasn't all that old
neither, you know.

14:58.162 --> 15:01.565
He was just about
my age now.

15:01.633 --> 15:04.869
You won't have to worry
about that drunk calling
no more, Archie.

15:04.936 --> 15:08.038
Thanks, Dave.
He's coming over here.
I gave him your address.

15:08.106 --> 15:10.374
Coming over here ?

15:10.441 --> 15:13.844
Sure, when he gets here,
I'll slap the cuffs on him.

15:13.912 --> 15:17.180
Gonna be quite a night,
ain't it, huh ?

15:36.300 --> 15:40.237
- You like being a cop,
don't you, Dave ?
- You want the truth ?

15:40.304 --> 15:42.239
I love it.

15:42.306 --> 15:45.910
Call me the fuzz, call me pig,
I really love it.

15:45.977 --> 15:49.880
I can tell you why
in two words:
Job security.

15:49.948 --> 15:51.882
Oh, jeez.

15:53.284 --> 15:56.587
I better get
the coffee.

15:56.655 --> 16:00.591
You know, when I was a kid,
my dad wanted me
to go into his business.

16:00.659 --> 16:04.595
When he heard that I
was gonna become a cop,
he hated my guts.

16:04.663 --> 16:08.599
- How'd you know that ?
- He told me, "Dave,
I hate your guts."

16:11.102 --> 16:15.272
You know, I got four cousins,
all my age, guys with families,

16:15.339 --> 16:18.042
all laid off
in the last year.

16:18.109 --> 16:22.880
Who knows when they'll work
again ? With the economy the
way it is, it could be never.

what are you doing up
at 3:30 in the morning ?

16:54.212 --> 16:58.281
I'm a night person,

Oh, you're all

Oh, hello, Edith.
I didn't know you

17:09.227 --> 17:12.496
Hi, Clara.
What are you doing up
at this hour ?

17:12.563 --> 17:14.665
I just came back
from a date.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.001
A plumber
who likes widows.

17:17.068 --> 17:20.569
He took me to a house party
in the Bronx.

17:20.638 --> 17:24.241
Twelve people.
All the men were plumbers.

17:27.078 --> 17:30.848
Anyway, I invited him
in to my house
for a cup of coffee,

17:30.915 --> 17:33.117
but I'm all out of coffee.

17:33.184 --> 17:36.687
Your lights were on,
so I thought maybe I
could borrow some.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.922
Oh, Clara, I'm sorry.

17:38.990 --> 17:42.126
I just made a pot
and I used it all up.

17:42.193 --> 17:45.362
Why don't you ask him
over here for a cup ?

17:45.429 --> 17:48.198
That'd be wonderful.
Hold it, hold it,
Mrs. weidermeyer.

17:48.266 --> 17:51.268
I don't mind you being here
because you're a friend
of my wife's,

17:51.335 --> 17:54.138
but I don't want strangers
running around the house
this time of night.

17:54.205 --> 17:56.674
You understand ?
Oh, sure.

17:56.741 --> 17:59.710
Clara, it's too bad
you can't have a cup
yourself.

17:59.778 --> 18:02.913
- Actually, I can.
- What about the plumber ?

18:02.981 --> 18:05.916
May I use your phone ?
I'll call and tell him.

18:07.285 --> 18:09.887
Uh, the fact is,
Mrs. weidermeyer,

18:09.954 --> 18:12.956
I'm expecting
a telephone call myself
at almost any moment,

18:13.024 --> 18:14.958
and I'd like to keep
that line free.

18:15.026 --> 18:19.629
I know what you mean.
Hello, Harold ?

18:19.698 --> 18:24.234
Harold, this is Clara.
Thank you for answering
the telephone in my house.

18:25.636 --> 18:29.239
Listen, Harold,
our date is over now.

18:32.543 --> 18:34.578
I'm gonna stay here
with the neighbors
for a while,

18:34.645 --> 18:36.580
so you go home.

18:38.817 --> 18:41.484

kiss me good night.

That's the way
the cookie crumples.

18:46.324 --> 18:50.594
I don't like to slur
a whole race, but plumbers
sure are pushy.

18:51.896 --> 18:55.432

was saying, "Harry feeney's late
and something is wrong."
