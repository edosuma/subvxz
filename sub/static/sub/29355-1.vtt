What's the big deal
with this book, anyway?

00:51.301 --> 00:55.180
It's apparently all deep, but I have
no idea what it's supposed to be about.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.724
It's... It's about alienation.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.894
An alien nation? What?
What chapter is that in?

01:00.977 --> 01:03.021
[chuckles] No, no. Alienation.

01:03.646 --> 01:06.441
It's about Ignatius
trying to find acceptance

01:06.524 --> 01:09.444
in a world that wants
nothing to do with him.

01:09.986 --> 01:13.531
Well, maybe he would find acceptance
if he wasn't such a know-it-all?

01:13.907 --> 01:17.577
I think his showing off his intelligence
is just a way of protecting himself,

01:17.660 --> 01:19.162
which is kind of tragic because

01:19.245 --> 01:21.915
the alienation is
the source of his strength, but then...

01:21.998 --> 01:24.417
But it's also the source of his problems.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.337
- I think you're starting to get it.
- [both laugh]

01:29.756 --> 01:32.300

I read that diethylstilbestrol is very
effective in stunting a child's growth.

02:30.608 --> 02:33.945
Honey, I don't think it's good to take
anything with that many consonants.

02:34.028 --> 02:38.449
In some girls, diethylstilbestrol
has successfully stunted growth.

02:38.533 --> 02:41.161
You know, in others,
it's caused a host of health problems.

02:42.370 --> 02:43.621
Infertility being one of them.

to win Teen Miss New Orleans...

23:27.572 --> 23:29.533

35:55.778 --> 35:58.378
So it's a coincidence the two of you
happened to be here together?

35:58.447 --> 35:59.782
- Yeah.
- Stay away from him.

35:59.866 --> 36:00.700
I will.

Homecoming king and queen.

Dad, what is going on?

36:35.526 --> 36:36.526
What do you mean?

36:37.403 --> 36:41.032
I mean, why is our house filled with
a bunch of ridiculously tall people?

36:41.490 --> 36:42.533
Who are they?

36:42.742 --> 36:45.745
Oh, just some friends that I invited over
for a little get-together.

36:46.078 --> 36:49.498
Okay, well, why are all your friends
wearing hats that say "Tip Toppers"?

36:49.832 --> 36:51.834
Well, that's because

36:51.918 --> 36:55.379
they are not only a group of friends,

36:55.463 --> 36:59.258
but they're also, you know, like, a group.

36:59.717 --> 37:00.968
You mean a club.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.845
No. Not a club.

37:02.929 --> 37:04.722

for our weekly chapter meeting.

37:24.408 --> 37:25.993

For our tall club.

37:27.995 --> 37:29.205

37:29.622 --> 37:32.416
Tall club? The Tip Toppers is a tall club?

37:32.875 --> 37:36.420
Tall Club International has over
200 chapters in the US alone.

hanging out with other tall people.

And... And then you could see
that they're perfectly okay being tall.

to make me feel more normal,

48:54.181 --> 48:56.475
You told me to slap you
if I ever saw you eating carbs.

48:56.558 --> 48:58.685
I did, but I didn't expect you
to actually do it.

48:58.769 --> 49:01.649
- What if you left a permanent mark?
- Okay, stop talking about yourself,

49:01.730 --> 49:03.330
and tell me how to undo what I just did.

49:04.149 --> 49:06.193
[chuckles] You... You can't undo it.

49:06.526 --> 49:08.362
You kissed him, and he kissed you back,

49:08.445 --> 49:10.673
which means girlfriend or not,
you've got a shot at this.

49:10.697 --> 49:12.616
You are forging ahead.
You are in the game.

49:12.699 --> 49:14.242
Just like General Custer.

49:14.618 --> 49:15.494
General Custer,

49:15.577 --> 49:17.287
not who you think he is!

49:20.916 --> 49:22.084
[sighs]

49:24.920 --> 49:25.920
Hey, Dunkers.

49:26.254 --> 49:27.255
Are you awake?

49:27.339 --> 49:28.507
What? Yeah.

49:29.007 --> 49:30.175
Yeah, man, what's up?

49:31.134 --> 49:32.678
I have to confess something.

49:34.721 --> 49:35.931
I cheated on Kimmy tonight.

49:37.057 --> 49:39.518
With Jodi, and she kissed me,

49:39.810 --> 49:41.561
and I kissed her back, and I...

49:42.062 --> 49:43.647
I didn't pull away.

49:45.482 --> 49:46.733
Am I a horrible person?

49:47.943 --> 49:49.778
[scoffs] No, man.

49:51.154 --> 49:52.239
No. People...

49:52.990 --> 49:55.951
[exhales] These things happen.
People have minor lapses in judgment.

49:58.286 --> 49:59.496
[breathes deeply]

50:01.456 --> 50:02.456
How was it?

50:06.294 --> 50:08.296
It was different than when I kiss Kimmy.

50:08.714 --> 50:11.174
It was really good, Dunkers.
It was intense and

50:11.258 --> 50:13.927
- passionate, and I could feel her heart...
- Cool.

50:14.344 --> 50:16.179
That's enough, you can stop now.

50:19.141 --> 50:20.308
So what should I do?

50:21.435 --> 50:24.146
Uh... You know, man, look.

50:24.229 --> 50:25.230
Well...

50:27.232 --> 50:32.738
You're already in a relationship,
you know, so...

50:33.405 --> 50:34.531
So, um...

50:35.449 --> 50:38.660
[stammers] I think you should probably
just focus on, you know,

50:39.578 --> 50:42.789
nurturing, caring for and continuing...

50:44.041 --> 50:45.167
that relationship.

50:45.250 --> 50:48.253
Right, but Dunkers, what if I like Jodi
more than I like Kimmy?

50:48.336 --> 50:49.546
[moans]

50:50.797 --> 50:51.715
Are you okay?

50:51.798 --> 50:53.842
Yeah. I'm fine. [chuckles]

50:53.925 --> 50:54.968
Good.

50:57.345 --> 50:59.222
Look, man, Jodi... Jodi's great.

50:59.806 --> 51:00.806
Yeah.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.559
And, you know, she smells...

51:04.227 --> 51:06.313
like a late August midday sun-shower,

51:06.396 --> 51:09.900
and she's got skin like sweet,
buttery whipped cream, but...

51:11.902 --> 51:15.614
You, my friend, are dating the hottest,

51:15.697 --> 51:18.408
most popular, most sought-after girl
in the whole school, so,

51:19.159 --> 51:22.454
you know, if you keep that up,
you're in line to be Homecoming King.

51:22.537 --> 51:25.373
That's a... You know, we don't
take that lightly around here.

51:26.416 --> 51:27.416
Right.

51:27.918 --> 51:29.544
Soon enough, you'll be back in Sweden

51:29.628 --> 51:33.215
and, you know,
you'll be living my life again. Ugh!

51:34.049 --> 51:36.760
Right? So you should take advantage
of the moment, man.

51:36.843 --> 51:39.679
This is your chance to be Ingvar Krueger.

51:40.097 --> 51:41.389
- Right.
- Yeah.

51:42.599 --> 51:45.477
- But here's the thing.
- Mm-hm.

51:46.895 --> 51:49.397
- I could still be friends with Jodi?
- Eh...

51:49.481 --> 51:51.108
- Really? No?
- I...

51:51.733 --> 51:55.112
[stammers] I just think you might be...
That might lead her on,

51:55.612 --> 51:59.032
you know, and it's probably best
for you to cut things off,

51:59.449 --> 52:00.617
just cold turkey.

52:00.700 --> 52:02.452
You know, it's the American way.

52:03.787 --> 52:04.787
Yes.

52:05.705 --> 52:06.706
[sighs]

52:07.332 --> 52:08.332
All right.

52:09.209 --> 52:10.919
- I'm... I'm glad I have you, man.
- Yeah.

52:11.002 --> 52:13.505
I appreciate your honesty.
That means a lot to me.

52:14.005 --> 52:15.048
Mm-hm.

52:16.925 --> 52:17.968
You kissed Stig?

52:18.051 --> 52:19.344
Could you keep your voice down?

52:19.427 --> 52:21.179
- Am I shouting?
- Yes.

52:21.471 --> 52:24.349
Sorry. But it's a big deal,
your first kiss!

52:24.432 --> 52:26.434
So how was it? Give me the deets.

52:27.519 --> 52:28.937
Pretty perfect.

52:29.020 --> 52:31.290
I mean, other than the fact
that he's dating someone else.

52:31.314 --> 52:32.816
But am I a terrible person?

52:32.899 --> 52:35.193
No, you're not. She is.

52:35.277 --> 52:37.571
She doesn't deserve him. You do.

52:37.863 --> 52:39.447
And I gotta say,

52:39.865 --> 52:40.907
I like new Jodi.

52:41.533 --> 52:42.576
New Jodi?

52:42.784 --> 52:45.662
"Face your fears" Jodi.
"Going after what you want" Jodi.

52:45.745 --> 52:48.582
"Look at me 'cause I look good" Jodi.

52:48.874 --> 52:50.893
it's about time you start following
your own advice.

52:50.917 --> 52:52.711
And when did I ever give that advice?

52:53.128 --> 52:56.006
To me. When you convinced me
to stand up to my parents

52:56.089 --> 52:59.089
and tell them I wanted to go to fashion
school instead of becoming a doctor.

52:59.134 --> 53:00.302
Ah. Right.

53:01.636 --> 53:04.139
Do you think they're ever gonna
forgive me about that?

53:04.556 --> 53:06.433
Oh, no. You're dead to them.

53:07.142 --> 53:08.643
What's that girl trying to prove?

53:08.727 --> 53:12.355
What, does she think makeup and
a new haircut's gonna make her less ugly?

53:15.150 --> 53:16.735
Do you think she's less ugly?

53:17.611 --> 53:22.032
Uh, no, no. No. She's, like, you know,
the same amount of ugly, right?

53:22.657 --> 53:23.657
[Kimmy] You're lying.

53:24.075 --> 53:25.075
Huh?

53:25.285 --> 53:26.912
All right, yeah. I mean, look at her.

53:27.370 --> 53:31.249
Look at her, she's so confident
and feeling herself and...

53:31.708 --> 53:34.294
She's like an independent woman
with golden locks.

53:35.253 --> 53:36.588
She looks kinda hot.

53:39.424 --> 53:40.800
Look, you better watch your back.

53:42.052 --> 53:43.803
[in German] She should watch hers.

53:44.721 --> 53:45.972
[in English] Here he comes.

54:00.028 --> 54:02.739
What happened last night?
You didn't respond to my text messages.

54:03.865 --> 54:04.950
Uh...

54:05.367 --> 54:07.118
Yeah, that was funny, actually.

54:07.202 --> 54:09.496
I... I left my phone on "off".

54:09.579 --> 54:10.579
Mm.

54:10.747 --> 54:11.915
Silent, I mean.

54:12.832 --> 54:14.542
No, I think it might be broken.

54:17.879 --> 54:20.382
Oh! Dunkers, man! We got a spot.

54:21.424 --> 54:23.051
Uh, no, that's fine. I'm just gonna...

54:23.134 --> 54:25.136
No, you're coming over here. Come on.

54:28.556 --> 54:29.557
Okay.

54:30.433 --> 54:32.519
This is my roommate. This is Dunkers.

54:32.602 --> 54:34.354
Yeah, uh, well, my name's Dunkleman,

54:34.437 --> 54:37.816
and I feel like I'm more of a landlord
than a roommate, so...

54:38.191 --> 54:40.485
[chuckles] Landlord! You're so funny.

54:41.069 --> 54:42.195
He's actually very funny.

54:42.279 --> 54:43.947
He does these impressions of people.

54:44.030 --> 54:45.073
What, impressions?

54:45.156 --> 54:46.384
- I don't think...
- The chef one.

54:46.408 --> 54:47.450
Gordon Ramsay.

54:47.534 --> 54:48.636
- I don't do...
- [Liz] Let's see it.

54:48.660 --> 54:49.494
- Mm-hm.
- Let's see it!

54:49.577 --> 54:51.377
- He's so good at this.
- Yeah, Gordon Ramsay.

54:51.413 --> 54:53.849
He's like, [in British accent] "You've
been braising that turkey for 15 minutes.

54:53.873 --> 54:54.873
Where's the lamb sauce?"

54:54.916 --> 54:55.959
[all laughing]

54:56.626 --> 54:58.336
No, do it. Come on, here. With this.

54:58.420 --> 54:59.563
- Oh, with the sushi?
- Yeah. Please.

54:59.587 --> 55:03.300
[in British accent] "Me nan could make
better sushi than this, and she's blind"!

55:03.383 --> 55:04.718
- Do the sandwich!
- "You donut."

55:04.801 --> 55:06.529
[in normal voice]
This, I actually love the sandwich bit.

55:06.553 --> 55:08.406
- [in British accent] "What are you"?
- I don't know!

55:08.430 --> 55:10.140
"An idiot sandwich"!

55:11.016 --> 55:12.392
Kevin Hart, Kevin Hart!

55:12.475 --> 55:15.496
- [Jake in normal voice] Sure, yeah, Kevin.
- In Sweden, they're crazy about this guy.

55:15.520 --> 55:17.230
All right, all right, all right!

55:17.522 --> 55:19.357
Yeah, you know Kevin, how he does that?

55:19.441 --> 55:22.193
That's not a Matthew McConaughey thing.
Kevin did it first, actually.

55:22.277 --> 55:24.070
You know, walk up to him and he's like...

55:25.405 --> 55:26.990
What am I watching?

55:27.782 --> 55:28.825
Unclear.

55:30.035 --> 55:32.579
<i>♪ All my people up
Plus the sky is up ♪</i>

55:33.830 --> 55:35.999
You're not really gonna eat Glutio's,
are you?

55:36.082 --> 55:37.082
They taste like sawdust.

55:37.334 --> 55:40.503
Well, I can't have gluten and so,
you know, kid's gotta snack.

55:41.713 --> 55:44.090
How about... Try one of these?

55:45.467 --> 55:46.509
You're gluten-free?

55:46.593 --> 55:47.802
Since 2012, baby.

55:48.428 --> 55:49.428
All right.

55:53.683 --> 55:55.935
Hold up, no. That is not gluten-free.

55:56.186 --> 55:58.426
- Who makes these?
- Girls Gone Vegan on Chestnut Street.

55:58.563 --> 55:59.564
I'll take you.

56:01.441 --> 56:02.942
Where have you been my whole life?

56:05.445 --> 56:07.781
- I was talking to the cookie.
- Cookie. Yeah. Okay.

56:08.698 --> 56:09.699
Keep it.

56:14.120 --> 56:18.083
So, what, am I not cool enough for you
to sit and have lunch with anymore?

56:18.166 --> 56:19.417
No, I was just, um...

56:19.501 --> 56:22.962
Stig asked me to sit by him for lunch,
and I didn't want to be rude.

56:24.047 --> 56:26.383
Did he say anything to you
about me recently?

56:26.966 --> 56:28.635
- Like what?
- I don't know.

56:29.219 --> 56:32.389
He just avoided me all day today, and I
thought we had a fun night last night.

56:33.348 --> 56:35.141
- Yeah, I bet you did.
- Excuse me?

56:35.225 --> 56:36.309
[Jack] What? Nothing.

56:36.393 --> 56:38.353
He did say something. What did he say?

56:38.436 --> 56:40.939
- I don't know.
- Excuse me, I'm talking to you.

56:42.190 --> 56:43.358
What did he tell you?

56:43.441 --> 56:44.442
[Jack groans]

56:44.734 --> 56:47.320
- Well, he said you guys kissed, okay?
- He what?

56:47.404 --> 56:48.884
You're going after a taken man, Jodi.

56:48.947 --> 56:51.092
There's plenty of other guys out there,
available ones.

56:51.116 --> 56:52.325
Just tell me what he said.

56:52.409 --> 56:55.245
He said he didn't know who he liked more,
you or Kimmy.

56:55.328 --> 56:56.704
He said that? Then what'd you say?

56:56.788 --> 56:59.749
I merely implied that, you know,
maybe he should focus on the relationship

56:59.833 --> 57:01.376
he's already in with Kimmy.

57:01.459 --> 57:04.921
Oh, so you're looking out for Kimmy now?
I thought you're supposed to be my friend.

57:05.004 --> 57:06.005
I am your friend.

57:06.089 --> 57:08.508
But if you can't have me, nobody can,
isn't that the idea?

57:08.591 --> 57:10.051
Jodi, don't flatter yourself.

57:10.135 --> 57:12.679
I actually have a date with Liz
to go to a gluten-free bakery.

57:12.762 --> 57:15.640
Mm. The start of the beginning
of no great love story ever.

57:15.723 --> 57:18.101
You may find this hard to believe,
but I care about you

57:18.184 --> 57:20.520
and I just want to make sure
that you don't get hurt.

57:24.232 --> 57:25.358
Ow!

57:27.819 --> 57:29.195
What's happened to you?

57:29.571 --> 57:30.822
Biking's for losers.

57:31.322 --> 57:32.490
Hey, can I...

57:32.991 --> 57:33.991
Can I talk to you?

57:34.451 --> 57:35.952
Yeah, sure. Come in.

57:39.164 --> 57:40.415
So, uh...

57:40.874 --> 57:41.875
What's up?

57:42.834 --> 57:46.421
Oh, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry
that I kissed you last night.

57:46.629 --> 57:48.423
- Oh, uh, that's okay.
- No.

57:48.506 --> 57:52.093
It's not. I mean, you have a girlfriend,
and I basically threw myself at you,

57:52.177 --> 57:55.054
which is probably why you...
blew me off today.

57:55.346 --> 57:57.265
I just didn't know what to say, honestly.

57:57.348 --> 57:59.100
No, no, no,
you don't have to say anything.

57:59.767 --> 58:02.729
You know, in fact, feel free
to just keep blowing me off.

58:03.313 --> 58:04.314
Really?

58:04.731 --> 58:05.607
- Yeah.
- Why?

58:05.690 --> 58:10.612
Because if you don't, then I'm just gonna
get my hopes up about happy endings

58:10.695 --> 58:14.824
that only happen in movies
with actresses that are under six feet.

58:15.533 --> 58:19.037
I... I'd still like to be friends,
Jodi, at least.

58:19.412 --> 58:21.414
Right, yeah. Friends, like,

58:21.831 --> 58:23.551
let's just forget that we kissed
and move on

58:23.583 --> 58:25.335
- like nothing ever happened.
- Yeah.

58:25.418 --> 58:26.794
- We could do that, right?
- Right.

58:26.878 --> 58:28.087
Yeah, yeah, totally.

58:28.171 --> 58:29.088
Oh, great.

58:29.172 --> 58:30.673
- Yeah, great.
- Good, good.

58:30.757 --> 58:31.841
- Awesome.
- Um...

58:32.717 --> 58:34.219
- [chuckles]
- I...

58:34.302 --> 58:35.303
High five.

58:36.513 --> 58:38.806
- Pfft. Higher five.
- Oh.

58:47.232 --> 58:50.026
[marching band music playing]

58:53.071 --> 58:54.711
[Fareeda] Okay, so then how did this end?

58:54.781 --> 58:56.449
Other than a few scratches, he's fine,

58:56.533 --> 58:58.368
but we're not on speaking terms
at the moment.

58:58.743 --> 59:01.496
- Is this your first fight ever?
- I think so.

59:01.579 --> 59:04.299
He didn't even start the day off
with one of his cheesy pickup lines.

59:04.541 --> 59:06.918
[inhales] So what are you gonna do
about Stig?

59:07.752 --> 59:10.171
Nothing. He made his choice.

59:10.255 --> 59:12.131
You don't need him. There'll be more.

59:12.590 --> 59:13.590
Yeah, well,

59:14.008 --> 59:16.928
me not getting the guy was always
how this was supposed to end.

59:18.471 --> 59:20.473
[music continues playing]

59:21.808 --> 59:22.934
Forget about them.

59:23.017 --> 59:24.060
Let's go dance.

59:24.811 --> 59:25.811
Jodi.

59:26.229 --> 59:27.730
Get in here.

59:27.814 --> 59:28.731
Pass.

59:28.815 --> 59:32.610
Not dancing to your high school marching
band before homecoming is bad juju.

59:33.111 --> 59:34.153
I'll risk it.

59:45.748 --> 59:47.542
[indistinct chatter]

59:59.304 --> 01:00:00.304
[Kimmy] Hey, Jodi.

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:02.014
We need to talk.

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:03.975
About what?

01:00:04.058 --> 01:00:05.058
About a guy.

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.770
It's come to my attention,
is very into you.

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:10.189
- Look, I did not mean for anything...
- Schnipper.

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:12.858
Schnipper?

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:14.860
He digs your new look.

01:00:15.236 --> 01:00:16.996
We're all going
to the escape room on Friday,

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.156
and you should come.

01:00:18.239 --> 01:00:20.319
Okay, I'm not falling
for another one of your tricks.

01:00:20.366 --> 01:00:23.202
It's not a trick.
He told me to come over and invite you.

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:25.288
And why should I believe you?

01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:27.474
'Cause I know I haven't always been
the nicest to you,

01:00:27.498 --> 01:00:30.126
but consider this
my way of making it up to you.

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:31.752
[in Italian] Bye.

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:39.527
[in English] What did that biatch want?

01:00:39.552 --> 01:00:41.763
She just invited me to hang out
Friday night.

01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:44.891
- Why?
- Because apparently Schnipper likes me.

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.661
- They're messing with you again.
- Yeah. That's what I thought.

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:50.229
But she sounded kind of genuine.

01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:51.939
Oh, you're dreaming.

01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:54.901
Is it really that hard to believe
that Schnipper would like me?

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:55.984
Yes.

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:58.321
All the guy does is make fun of you.

01:00:58.404 --> 01:01:01.783
And even if it were true, why would you
wanna go out with Schnipper?

01:01:02.116 --> 01:01:06.663
Maybe if Stig saw that I moved on,
he would realize that he made a mistake.

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:09.165
Okay, but we have tickets to
Tank and the Bangas on Friday.

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.626
And I'm sure you can find
someone else to go with.

01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:14.879
Wow, so now you're flaking on me?

01:01:15.546 --> 01:01:18.132
Why are you giving me
such a hard time about this?

01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:21.719
Why are you acting so crazy over a guy
who, you just admitted two minutes ago,

01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:22.845
was never going to happen?

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:25.139
Do you really need validation that badly?

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:26.683
If you're not going to have my back,

01:01:26.766 --> 01:01:29.602
I would really just prefer
you keep your opinions to yourself.

01:01:33.564 --> 01:01:35.608
Don't worry, I will.

01:01:58.005 --> 01:01:59.173
Welcome

01:01:59.632 --> 01:02:02.635
to <i>Maison</i> Voodoo.

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:05.888
It was there

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:08.975
where me and my entire clan were murdered

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:11.519
just last night.

01:02:12.478 --> 01:02:15.231
Now, you have exactly one hour...

01:02:15.314 --> 01:02:18.234
To hunt for clues, find the killer,
meet the same fate, blah, blah, blah.

01:02:18.317 --> 01:02:19.957
It's not our first rodeo. Just let us in.

01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:22.696
[sighs]

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.615
Whatever. I get paid either way.

01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:26.117
Uh, wait right there.

01:02:28.953 --> 01:02:31.956
[Kimmy] So, where's
the Homecoming hangout this year?

01:02:37.628 --> 01:02:38.628
[Jack] Uh...

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:42.592
I mean, well, my mom's going out of town
on a yoga retreat that weekend,

01:02:42.675 --> 01:02:45.511
so I guess I can have
a little get-together at mine.

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:46.512
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:47.764
That's perfect.

01:02:47.847 --> 01:02:49.056
Party at Dunkleman's!

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.224
No, no, get-together.

01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:53.102
- Party!
- Get-together!

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:55.396
- Get-together.
- Party, party, party! Party.

01:02:56.022 --> 01:02:57.942
Get-together. I said...
You guys heard me, right?

01:02:58.775 --> 01:02:59.776
[phone ringing]

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:00.901
- It's a party.
- Get...

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:02.028
- Hello?
- Mm-hm.

[indistinct chatter]

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:05.614
[Jack] What?

01:03:06.365 --> 01:03:08.367
Oh. Uh, okay. All right.

01:03:09.827 --> 01:03:11.496
First clue's in the parlor upstairs.

01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:13.915
Stiggy. Stiggy, come on.

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:20.254
So, since when do you throw parties
or get-togethers?

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.965
Well, I'm hanging out with
a pretty popular crew now,

01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:24.383
so it's sort of expected of me.

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.636

What was so important
you needed to meet in private?

01:06:13.761 --> 01:06:17.723
Well, you know that whole plan we had
about, "Let's forget we kissed"?

01:06:18.265 --> 01:06:19.265
Yeah.

01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:20.851
I hate that plan.

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:23.854
It's a really terrible plan that we made.

01:06:24.188 --> 01:06:25.188
I, uh...

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:27.501
I mean, it means I have to see you
kissing Schnipper...

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:30.111
Which is never gonna happen again.

01:06:30.194 --> 01:06:32.405
- Thank God.
- I honestly did that to make you jealous.

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:33.948
Well, that worked.

01:06:34.198 --> 01:06:36.826

01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:41.580
I'll end it with Kimmy
if it means I can be with you.

01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:45.501
I was thinking I would do it tonight,
and, um...

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.712
maybe we could meet up after?

01:06:49.463 --> 01:06:51.549
I, uh, I... I can't tonight.

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:53.676
It's my sister's pageant.

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:55.511
Right.

I mean, unless you want to be my plus-one.

01:06:59.557 --> 01:07:00.933
You mean, like, a date?

01:07:02.226 --> 01:07:03.936
Yeah, like a date.

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:07.023
- I'd love to.
- [Jodi laughs]

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:09.316
And then we could go
to Dunker's party together.

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:10.901
But on one condition.

01:07:11.485 --> 01:07:13.446
You be my date

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:15.364
for Homecoming?

01:07:16.532 --> 01:07:18.159
Yes, of course.

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:24.415
So, Stig is coming with you tonight,

01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:26.542
- and he asked you to Homecoming?
- That's right.

01:07:26.625 --> 01:07:30.212
Okay, this is all possible because he's
breaking up with Kimmy to be with you?

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:33.007
Which I feel bad about, but...

01:07:33.632 --> 01:07:35.259
yeah, he is.

Nothing. Nothing's...
Nothing's wrong. Um...

01:07:43.642 --> 01:07:44.935
Y... You know, it was just...

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:46.729
I don't know. It was...

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:49.356
It was nice when
you needed me for something.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:52.699
We'll probably just go back to
you never needing me for anything again.

01:07:53.694 --> 01:07:54.694
What do you mean?

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:57.031
Well, up until last month,

01:07:57.114 --> 01:07:58.994
you've never really needed my help
for anything.

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:03.412
Well, I... I wanted to, you know,
talk to you about stuff, but...

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:05.206
Why didn't you?

01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:07.750
I don't know, just because

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:10.461
you were just busy with all your pageants,

01:08:10.544 --> 01:08:12.880
and I just figured
that you weren't interested.

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.093
You mean more to me

01:08:17.843 --> 01:08:19.220
than any stupid crown.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:24.225
Then I guess I will come to you
about stuff, then.

01:08:25.725 --> 01:08:26.725
Okay.

01:08:27.853 --> 01:08:28.854

01:08:29.563 --> 01:08:30.563
Yeah.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:32.942

- Yes, he's coming.

We're just so excited to meet him.

01:10:51.121 --> 01:10:54.083
I guess the one way that I would work
to make the world a better place

01:10:54.166 --> 01:10:57.628
is by using
my hotel management skills, which...

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:01.381

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:03.175

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:13.060

01:11:15.312 --> 01:11:19.066
if we could meet and exceed
guest expectations...

01:11:22.861 --> 01:11:25.489

[mother] Don't talk like that.

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:04.862
I'm serious.
I'm gonna run over Stig with the car.

01:12:04.945 --> 01:12:06.322
Okay, then you'll go to jail.

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:08.991

Jodi.

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:14.932
Ah, Jodi, I'm... I'm sorry.
Can I explain, please?

01:13:15.015 --> 01:13:16.266
Please, yeah, explain.

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:18.477
I had to help Dunkers
with the party all day,

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.437
and then people started showing up early,

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:22.815
and, I don't know, it got crazy.

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:25.734
And honestly, I lost track of time.
I'm sorry.

01:13:27.319 --> 01:13:28.654
Okay, so,

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:30.781
did you talk to Kimmy?

01:13:31.865 --> 01:13:34.993
I was going to, I was, but then she kept
getting pulled into conversations,

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:37.037
and I wanted, like,
a quiet moment to do it,

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:39.415
- you know? So I just...
- Stig, Stig, quick selfie, dude.

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:41.667
Yeah. All right, yeah.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.603
- Nice! Yes! Love you, bro.
- Does it work?

01:13:43.627 --> 01:13:45.087
All right. Yeah, you too, man!

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:49.633
What?

01:13:49.716 --> 01:13:51.468
You're not breaking up with Kimmy.

01:13:52.052 --> 01:13:53.345
You never were.

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:54.638
Jodi, why would you say that?

01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:56.849
Because you like being the popular guy.

01:13:59.226 --> 01:14:02.229
Much more than you like me, so...

01:14:02.312 --> 01:14:04.148
No. Jodi.

01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:05.607
Hey, come on. Come back.

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:07.776
Stig, over here, man.
You gotta check this out.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.870
Do you... Do you have a date yet?

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:19.830
I do not.

01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:22.416
Do you want to go with me?

01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:24.668
I do, yeah.

01:14:24.751 --> 01:14:26.044
[both chuckle]

01:14:28.922 --> 01:14:29.965
And I don't.

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:32.759
I do and I don't.

01:14:33.093 --> 01:14:35.262
I'm confused. I thought you liked me.

01:14:35.345 --> 01:14:37.431
I do, I do. I'm just, uh...

01:14:39.016 --> 01:14:40.142
sorta in love...

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:42.561

01:14:44.521 --> 01:14:45.521
I know.

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:48.775
- What?
- Yeah.

01:14:49.067 --> 01:14:50.986
I see the way that you look at Jodi.

01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:55.491
So why aren't you guys together?

01:14:57.784 --> 01:15:00.996
Um, I don't... I don't know.
I guess I'm just not her type.

01:15:01.079 --> 01:15:04.791
So you're gonna spend the rest of
your life waiting until you are her type?

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:08.962
If that's what it takes, then, yeah.

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:11.756
Okay.

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:15.010
I'm sorry. I know you must hate me.

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:16.512
I'm bummed.

01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:18.722
But I don't hate you.

01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:23.143
Your art, though, that, I hate.

01:15:23.727 --> 01:15:25.979
I hate that. [laughs]

01:16:22.202 --> 01:16:23.745
Don't worry. I'm not gonna...

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:26.707
say anything or do anything to upset you.

01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:27.874
I just, uh...

01:16:32.045 --> 01:16:33.839
just wanna tell you I love you.

Since when do you know karate? [coughs]

01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:39.399
My mom. She made me take
self-defense classes a few years ago

01:19:39.483 --> 01:19:41.123

01:19:41.568 --> 01:19:42.903

- I...
- And... And what happened to your eye?

01:19:46.406 --> 01:19:50.786
Last night took a crazy turn,
and, um, I... I took a spill,

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:52.454
but I'm... [coughs]...I'm fine.

01:19:52.537 --> 01:19:54.039
- Does it hurt?
- Not...

Not so much, um...

My mom asked me the exact same thing when
she came home a day early from her retreat

01:20:01.087 --> 01:20:03.340
and then grounded me
for wrecking the house.

01:20:03.423 --> 01:20:04.591
[laughs]

01:20:05.425 --> 01:20:07.093

- Yikes.

So, uh...

01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:11.765
no more Homecoming for me.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:16.644
Sorry.

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:20.899
You have nothing to apologize for.

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:26.363
I haven't been the best friend recently.

01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:30.659
And, uh, I am sorry.

01:20:33.912 --> 01:20:35.121
But I got you a present.

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.290
To hopefully...

01:20:39.125 --> 01:20:40.418
try and make up for it.

01:20:40.794 --> 01:20:42.462
So I'm not gonna say anything else.

01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:44.089
- Just open it.
- Okay.

01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:46.549
I... I like the box.

01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:48.009

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:49.510
Open it.

01:20:59.145 --> 01:21:00.355
- High heels.
- Mm-hm.

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:04.693
They're from a specialty drag queen store
called Scream Queens.

01:21:04.776 --> 01:21:06.194
It's this great place,

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:07.529
and they gave me a gift card,

01:21:07.612 --> 01:21:10.073
so if I come in, like, nine more times,
I get a free pair.

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.034
They're, uh, beautiful.

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:14.118
Thank you.

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.538
But I'm never gonna wear them.

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:17.830
Okay.

01:21:18.331 --> 01:21:19.374
Just keep 'em,

01:21:19.916 --> 01:21:20.917
just in case.

01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:23.252
Why?

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:26.756
I am glad you asked that, actually.
Let me paint you a picture.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.818
- Please don't...
- No, no, no, stick with me here.

01:21:28.842 --> 01:21:30.844
We're three years in the future.

01:21:30.927 --> 01:21:32.429
You are at some

01:21:32.929 --> 01:21:37.017
nice college in the Midwest,
Northwestern, maybe Notre Dame.

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:39.059
And...

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:41.228
you meet some...

01:21:42.188 --> 01:21:43.356
taller-than-you

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:44.941
nice guy...

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:49.696
and he really likes you because

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:51.740
of how kind you are.

01:21:53.116 --> 01:21:56.286
And he likes how you sit up front
with your Uber drivers

01:21:56.369 --> 01:21:58.705
'cause you don't want them
to be lonely and...

01:22:00.624 --> 01:22:04.044
how you hate raisins but love Raisin Bran,

01:22:04.127 --> 01:22:05.545
which doesn't make any sense to me.

01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:07.547
But again, maybe he likes it.

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:12.761
And he asks you out on a date.

01:22:14.846 --> 01:22:16.389
And you wanna wear your heels.

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:19.643
And then you try and go out and buy some,

01:22:19.726 --> 01:22:22.270
and you can't get any
'cause there's a snowstorm outside.

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:25.106
So you think back to this moment
and you go, "Damn.

01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:30.695
I should have kept those heels that
Dunkleman gave me just in case."

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:44.042
It wouldn't work out with the guy.
It wouldn't. Yeah.

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:46.461
- Right.
- But you'd look amazing, so...

01:22:47.921 --> 01:22:48.922
[chuckles]

01:22:50.256 --> 01:22:51.256
Thank you.

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:54.468
Yeah, no problem.

01:23:17.575 --> 01:23:18.660
[phone chimes]

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:38.013

01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:41.099

just as a reminder</i>

in the kitchen earlier?</i>

<i>Seemed kind of important.</i>

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:57.907
Uh, I... I messed with her.

01:23:57.991 --> 01:24:00.511
Yeah, Kimmy, I messed with her,
and... and she was pissed at me.

01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:02.495
- [Kimmy] <i> What'd you do?</i>
- [Stig] <i>Uh...</i>

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:04.718
Okay, so she came over here the other day,

01:24:04.789 --> 01:24:07.435
and she was saying that the reason
that she left the escape room was

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:09.961
because she couldn't stand to see me
with, uh, somebody else.

01:24:10.670 --> 01:24:14.007
So, basically just saying
that she's, uh, secretly in love with me.

01:24:14.632 --> 01:24:16.217
- [laughing]
- What?

01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:18.720
Confessing love?
Dude, that's, like, totally lame.

01:24:18.803 --> 01:24:20.555
Like, I'm definitely
not in love with Jodi.

01:24:21.347 --> 01:24:23.467
[Stig] <i>Right, so anyways,
I couldn't get her to leave,</i>

01:24:23.516 --> 01:24:24.768
so just to get her off my back,

01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:26.611
I said, "Yeah,
I'll meet up with you tonight.

01:24:26.644 --> 01:24:29.814
We can talk more about it." But, uh...
But I... I totally stood her up.

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:32.192
[Schnipper scoffs] <i>Man! My guy!</i>

01:24:32.275 --> 01:24:33.485
<i>Sauvage,</i> bro.

01:24:33.568 --> 01:24:34.568
[Jack] Hey!

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.321
Dunkers!

01:24:37.864 --> 01:24:39.064
[Stig] <i>Dunkers, what's your...</i>

01:24:39.115 --> 01:24:40.408
[rewinding sound]

01:24:40.825 --> 01:24:42.327

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:43.495
[Jack] <i>Hey.</i>

01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:44.746
<i>- What're you...
- Dunkers.</i>

01:24:46.206 --> 01:24:47.832
Dunkers, what's your problem, man?

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.375
You are, man, you are.

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:52.378
When I met you,
you were genuinely a super nice guy, man.

01:24:52.462 --> 01:24:53.963
But you've turned into such a jerk.

01:24:54.047 --> 01:24:56.549
<i>You're talking trash about Jodi
to all these people in public,</i>

01:24:56.633 --> 01:24:59.969
but when we're in private, man,
you're confessing your love for her to me.

01:25:00.345 --> 01:25:03.014
The crazy thing is you don't even
know a thing about her, man.

01:25:03.348 --> 01:25:05.350
What's her birthday, huh?
What's her middle name?

01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:07.633
What's her favorite color?
What color are her eyes, man?

01:25:07.852 --> 01:25:09.813
- Green.
- No, they're not, they're blue.

01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:14.275
I mean, Jodi has so much to offer.
She's the best person that I know.

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:17.153
<i>I bet you didn't even know
she's reading the list of 100 best books</i>

01:25:17.237 --> 01:25:18.797
<i>before she turns 21, did you know that?</i>

01:25:18.822 --> 01:25:19.989
And that's what's so funny,

01:25:20.073 --> 01:25:23.034
is you think you're so much cooler
than her, but you're not.

01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:25.453
You guys, none of you guys are.
You think...

01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:28.623
She is so much cooler
than all of you guys combined.

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:31.376
Yeah, well, she's also taller
than all of us combined, so...

01:25:31.918 --> 01:25:33.086
- [chuckles] Yeah.
- Hey...

And Principal Preston,
may I just say, you look fantastic.

01:28:09.826 --> 01:28:12.495
Have you lost weight or something?
What is it?

01:28:12.745 --> 01:28:13.830
We'll talk later.

01:28:14.163 --> 01:28:17.917
And now, without further ado,
your Homecoming King and Queen.

01:28:19.002 --> 01:28:20.253

01:29:33.785 --> 01:29:35.661
Because being Ingvar Krueger

01:29:35.745 --> 01:29:37.830
wasn't as great as
I thought it was going to be.

01:29:38.289 --> 01:29:39.540

This is because you like Jodi, isn't it?

01:29:47.673 --> 01:29:50.718
Can you explain to me, because I don't
understand. What do you see in her?

01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:36.556
Can I, uh,
have everyone's attention, please?

01:30:40.852 --> 01:30:42.854
Uh, hi, I am Jodi.

01:30:44.439 --> 01:30:45.773
You may know me as

01:30:46.274 --> 01:30:47.900
Amazon or Godzilla

01:30:47.984 --> 01:30:50.736
or Jodi the Green Giant,
or any of those other

insults that you've called me
in the past years, um...

01:30:55.158 --> 01:30:56.367
You know what? I... I get it.

01:30:56.451 --> 01:31:00.329
I'm... I'm tall, really, really tall,
and it's the thing that's haunted me

01:31:00.913 --> 01:31:02.039
my entire life.

01:31:02.331 --> 01:31:03.416
It's, um,

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:05.293
it's defined me.

01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:10.756
But I think it's time that I come up
with a new definition.

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:13.193
- And I'd like to say one thing.
- Harper.

01:31:13.217 --> 01:31:14.611
- My moment, not yours.
- One thing.

01:31:14.635 --> 01:31:16.429
- Not mine. Okay.
- Not yours.

01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:24.270
I'm so much more than just a tall girl.

01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:26.230
I'm a sister.

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:30.485
I'm a best friend. [chuckles]

01:31:34.947 --> 01:31:35.947
Sorry.

I'm smart.

I'm fun.

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:43.080
And I've made mistakes.

01:31:43.956 --> 01:31:46.876
I've kissed a guy who I knew
had a girlfriend.

01:31:47.418 --> 01:31:48.418
What?

01:31:49.378 --> 01:31:50.463
And I'm sorry.

01:31:52.089 --> 01:31:53.174
That was wrong.

01:31:54.884 --> 01:31:56.719
And I play piano,

01:31:56.802 --> 01:31:59.430
and I'm... I'm really, really good at it.

01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:04.810
Being tall, actually, is what makes me,
me, and I... I like me.

01:32:04.894 --> 01:32:06.646
And you should like you.

01:32:07.063 --> 01:32:08.564
We're all good enough.

no one can take it away.

So go ahead and...
and keep making fun of me.

Keep calling me names, keep asking me,
"How's the weather up there?" Because...

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:21.202
I can take it.
