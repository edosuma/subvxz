00:37.510 --> 00:39.968
It's Channel 6 Action News.

00:41.722 --> 00:43.596
Ah, Action News.

00:43.766 --> 00:46.767
The last place an impressionable kid
can go for TV violence.

00:46.935 --> 00:50.200
Now here's your Action anchor,
Kent Brockman.

00:50.189 --> 00:52.561
Hello, I'm Kent Brockman!
Our top stories tonight:

00:52.733 --> 00:55.220
A tremendous explosion
in the price of lumber.

00:55.194 --> 00:57.519
"President Reagan dyes...

00:57.696 --> 01:00.816
...his hair, " says Gary Trudeau
in his new musical comedy review.

01:00.991 --> 01:04.277
But first let's check the death count
from the killer storm...

01:04.453 --> 01:07.205
...bearing down on us
like a shotgun full of snow.

01:08.916 --> 01:12.534
As of now, the death count is zero.
But it is ready to shoot right up.

01:12.795 --> 01:16.413
Oh, my God!
Damn you, snow!

01:16.632 --> 01:19.586
All right! Snow day!
No school tomorrow!

01:21.136 --> 01:24.422
That doesn't mean no book report.
What if the weatherman is wrong?

01:24.598 --> 01:27.469
Lisa, that man is a
professional meteorologist.

01:27.643 --> 01:30.644
Kent, I'd like to remind everybody
to come down and watch me...

01:30.813 --> 01:34.182
...at the Springfield Laugh and Brew
and Burgers and Fries on Saturday.

01:34.358 --> 01:38.225
The forecast calls for
a 75%/% chance of hilarity.

01:38.445 --> 01:39.856
I like those odds.

01:41.824 --> 01:43.448
Snowball fight!

01:52.584 --> 01:54.743
You're gonna eat a blizzard of...

01:54.962 --> 01:56.919
...unseasonable warmth?

01:57.890 --> 02:00.256
I made the snowball from the frost
in our freezer.

02:02.261 --> 02:04.550
Nice P.J. S, Simpson.

02:04.722 --> 02:06.928
Did your mommy buy them for you?

02:07.308 --> 02:09.181
Of course she did.
Who else would have?

02:10.936 --> 02:15.645
All right, Simpson.
You win this round.

02:16.275 --> 02:18.149
Okay, it's book report time.

02:18.360 --> 02:22.610
We'll do them alphabetically.
Today it's A through M.

02:22.281 --> 02:25.566
I'm saved!
I love being a Simpson.

02:25.784 --> 02:27.409
Let's see. We have no A's.

02:27.578 --> 02:29.701
So let's go right to the B's.
Bart.

02:31.810 --> 02:32.540
Mrs. Krabappel...

02:32.708 --> 02:34.997
...I didn't...

02:35.169 --> 02:37.161
Attention. This is Principal Skinner...

02:37.379 --> 02:40.416
...your principal, with a message
from the principal's office.

02:40.633 --> 02:43.254
All students proceed immediately
to an assembly...

02:43.469 --> 02:45.177
...in the Butthead Memorial Auditorium.

02:45.471 --> 02:48.900
Damn it, I wish we hadn't let
the students name that.

02:48.223 --> 02:52.700
Children, the times they are
becoming quite different.

02:52.353 --> 02:54.760
Test scores are at an all-time low.

02:54.938 --> 02:57.975
So I've come up with these
academic alerts!

02:58.150 --> 03:02.170
You will receive one as soon as
your grades start to slip in any subject.

03:02.196 --> 03:05.316
Your parents won't have to wait
until report cards to punish you.

03:05.532 --> 03:07.406
How innovative. I like it.

03:07.743 --> 03:11.491
Hey, Dolph, take a memo
on your Newton: Beat up Martin.

03:15.876 --> 03:17.287
Bah!

03:17.586 --> 03:20.753
All right, first academic alert:
Wiggum, Ralph.

03:20.923 --> 03:23.414
I won! I won!

03:25.940 --> 03:28.178
No. No, Ralph.
This means you're failing English.

03:28.389 --> 03:31.592
Me fail English?
That's "unpossible."

03:31.809 --> 03:35.972
Muntz, Nelson. You're failing
history, geography and math.

03:36.188 --> 03:40.400
- But you're doing quite well in home ec.
- Hey! Keep it down, man.

03:40.609 --> 03:42.151
Simpson...

03:42.319 --> 03:44.270
...Lisa.

03:44.196 --> 03:47.731
Grades are all I have.
What could I be failing?

03:47.950 --> 03:50.156
I'm smart and a teacher's pet.

03:52.162 --> 03:57.239
Gym?! That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard!

04:05.920 --> 04:08.543
Lisa, your father and I are very
concerned about this warning.

04:08.762 --> 04:10.802
I really hope you try harder.

04:11.223 --> 04:15.268
That's all of them. And I'm so proud
you didn't try to forge my name.

04:15.436 --> 04:16.846
How about a present, son?

04:17.620 --> 04:19.221
Well, I could use a new pair
of hockey skates.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.563
- Done and done.
- That's not fair.

04:21.774 --> 04:24.562
Why is Bart getting a present,
and I'm getting chewed out?

04:24.737 --> 04:27.620
Ah, the mysteries of life.

04:27.239 --> 04:28.568
Tell you what, Simpson.

04:28.782 --> 04:32.827
I won't fail you if you join one of
those Pee Wee teams outside the school.

04:33.370 --> 04:35.954
You mean, where parents push kids
into vicious competition...

04:36.123 --> 04:38.696
...to compensate for
their own failed dreams of glory?

04:38.917 --> 04:40.495
Look, I don't need this.

04:40.669 --> 04:43.706
I inhaled my favorite whistle
this morning.

04:58.896 --> 05:03.807
Children, that was our only ball.
There'll be no team this year.

05:07.947 --> 05:12.608
Mom, this is really scary.
I'm gonna get my first F ever.

05:12.785 --> 05:16.569
Cheer up. So you're not good at sports.
It's a very small part of life.

05:16.789 --> 05:19.458
Sports, sports, sports, sports

05:19.667 --> 05:24.163
Marge, Bart rides up in the front seat
today because he's a good guy at sports.

05:24.338 --> 05:27.430
I think Lisa needs to feel
a little special tonight.

05:27.216 --> 05:30.252
How about letting her
ride up front too?

05:30.803 --> 05:32.131
I tried.

05:34.640 --> 05:37.724
Okay, son. Just remember
to have fun out there today.

05:37.893 --> 05:43.232
- And if you lose, I'll kill you!
- Oh, Dad.

05:50.447 --> 05:52.155
All right, Pigs, beat those Gougers.

05:57.413 --> 06:01.161
I could've been equipment manager,
but no!

06:12.594 --> 06:14.836
Our goalie cannot stand up.

06:15.140 --> 06:16.389
Tell you what, get some rope.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.646
Defense! Defense!
Come on! You call that blowing!

06:38.162 --> 06:41.744
Oh, yes, we won!
We won! We won!

06:41.915 --> 06:44.751
Unfortunately, since I bet
on the other team...

06:44.918 --> 06:46.792
...we won't be going for pizza.

06:47.796 --> 06:52.458
Well, boy, you won. So I'm gonna live up
to my side of the agreement.

06:52.676 --> 06:55.346
Here's your turtle, alive and well.

06:55.512 --> 06:58.264
Aw, thanks, Dad.

06:58.974 --> 07:01.181
How about some adulation
from my little sister?

07:01.393 --> 07:05.110
Wow, Bart, I'm so impressed you were
able to give Milhouse a concussion.

07:05.230 --> 07:06.890
Aw, you're just jealous.

07:07.660 --> 07:11.526
Because... you... stink... at... sports!

07:11.737 --> 07:13.564
- Cut it out, Bart!
- What the...?

07:15.741 --> 07:20.533
You know, I wonder if her skills
will transfer over to the game of hockey.

07:20.704 --> 07:24.998
Well, only one way to be sure.
Heads up, little girl!

07:28.128 --> 07:30.251
The goalie of my dreams!

07:32.508 --> 07:35.378
Let's try a hard one to make sure
it wasn't a fluke.

07:38.970 --> 07:41.715
Hey! Way to knock out my teeth!

07:41.892 --> 07:44.383
Yeah, that's it, Milhouse.
Keep up the chatter.

07:49.233 --> 07:53.646
Lisa, if the Bible has taught us
nothing else, and it hasn't...

07:53.821 --> 07:56.312
...it's that girls should stick
to girl sports.

07:56.490 --> 08:00.702
Such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing
and such and such.

08:00.911 --> 08:03.580
I think women should be able to play
any sport men play.

08:03.747 --> 08:07.827
But hockey is so violent and dangerous.
Look at Milhouse's teeth.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.793
Mom, will you stop showing us those?

08:09.962 --> 08:12.850
I have to join the team
or I'll get an F...

08:12.256 --> 08:14.961
...that will haunt me
for the rest of my life.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.379
I now pronounce you
president of these United...

08:19.555 --> 08:22.924
Stop the inauguration! I just discovered
our president-elect...

08:23.100 --> 08:24.974
...got an F in second-grade gym class!

08:26.520 --> 08:31.478
In that case, I sentence you to a lifetime
of horror on Monster Island.

08:31.650 --> 08:33.442
Don't worry. It's just a name.

08:37.780 --> 08:40.153
He said it was just a name!

08:40.326 --> 08:43.529
What he meant is that Monster Island
is actually a peninsula.

08:47.291 --> 08:49.746
Do you have my teeth?

08:51.420 --> 08:52.748
No.

08:56.216 --> 08:59.170
Okay, hotshots. Now that my daughter
is on your team...

08:59.345 --> 09:01.503
...I want to make a few things clear.

09:01.722 --> 09:03.679
Please, Dad. I'll be fine.

09:05.225 --> 09:09.472
I don't want anyone to give her
a hard time just because she's different.

09:09.646 --> 09:11.888
No jokes, no taunting...

09:12.733 --> 09:15.734
Look! That kid's got bosoms!
Who's got a wet towel?

09:16.862 --> 09:19.151
Come here, you butterball.

09:19.365 --> 09:22.615
Don't make me run!
I'm full of chocolate!

09:31.850 --> 09:33.706
I can't watch. I don't know how
you two can sit here...

09:33.879 --> 09:36.833
...laughing at poor Lisa
while she's probably scared to death.

09:37.700 --> 09:42.214
We're laughing with her, Marge.
There's a big difference.

09:46.642 --> 09:47.970
With her.

09:48.185 --> 09:50.308
You really think I did okay
out there, Mom?

09:50.521 --> 09:55.990
Absolutely, honey. By blocking the net,
I really think you helped your team.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.317
Okay, little buddy. Hop in.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.236
I mean my little girl buddy.

10:02.449 --> 10:06.696
That's very nice, but it's wrong for you
to reward violent, competitive behavior.

10:06.870 --> 10:10.453
However, I will sit up front with you
if it's a fatherly gesture of love.

10:10.666 --> 10:12.208
Okay, hon.

10:12.376 --> 10:15.827
Sucker! Competitive violence,
that's why you're here!

10:37.192 --> 10:39.565
We're having our best season ever.

10:39.778 --> 10:43.646
And I would like to say that
it is because of teamwork.

10:43.866 --> 10:46.617
Gee, who am I kidding, huh?
It's all because of Lisa.

10:46.827 --> 10:49.330
Let's hear it for Lisa!

10:51.290 --> 10:54.623
Hey, Bart. If Lisa's better than you
at hockey...

10:54.835 --> 10:58.584
...does that mean you're gonna become
better than her at school?

10:58.964 --> 11:04.884
Maybe I will, Milhouse.
Maybe I will.

11:08.599 --> 11:11.386
Who can tell me the capital of Spain?
Bart Simpson.

11:11.560 --> 11:14.810
The square root of 36?
Bart Simpson.

11:14.980 --> 11:17.352
Who freed the slaves?
Bart Simpson.

11:17.608 --> 11:19.980
Bart Simpson. Bart Simpson.

11:20.152 --> 11:24.660
Bart Simpson, stop raising your hand.
You haven't had one right answer today.

11:24.281 --> 11:25.906
Sorry.

11:26.325 --> 11:29.445
This is for wasting
teacher's valuable time!

11:32.498 --> 11:35.249
Lay off, guys! He's with me.

11:35.709 --> 11:39.493
It's a lucky coincidence
you happen to be your sister's brother.

11:39.672 --> 11:42.708
Don't worry, Bart.
They won't bother you anymore.

11:46.428 --> 11:49.215
I hardly ever let Mother
fight for me anymore.

11:49.431 --> 11:52.516
Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna hang out
with Lisa...

11:52.685 --> 11:54.143
...for protection...

11:54.311 --> 11:56.600
...and to be seen!

11:59.108 --> 12:00.483
Come watch TV with me, Dad.

12:00.693 --> 12:04.358
We missed the first two Cops, but if
we hurry, we can catch the last three.

12:04.571 --> 12:07.608
Oh, sorry, Bart. Lisa and I are going out
for gelato.

12:07.783 --> 12:10.155
We'd ask you to come, but...

12:10.327 --> 12:11.656
...you know.

12:13.664 --> 12:16.949
- Bart, I can spend some time with you.
- I don't know, Mom.

12:17.126 --> 12:20.376
Don't have a stereotypical view of me
just because I'm your mother.

12:20.546 --> 12:23.962
I know. How about we play
the basketball?

12:24.133 --> 12:27.299
I'm no Harvey Globetrotter, but...

12:28.721 --> 12:31.176
Watch out for the Shaq attack!

12:33.350 --> 12:35.142
I told you to watch out.

12:35.352 --> 12:38.139
Hey, Milhouse! Knock him down
if he's in your way!

12:38.355 --> 12:39.897
Jimbo, Jimbo! Go for the face!

12:40.107 --> 12:42.978
Look! Ralph Wiggum lost
his shinguard!

12:43.193 --> 12:46.290
Hack the bone!
Hack the bone!

12:46.238 --> 12:49.690
Wow! Eye of the tiger!
Mouth of a teamster!

12:49.992 --> 12:54.203
To think of all the time
I wasted on you!

12:54.788 --> 12:57.825
Well, not wasted...

12:57.100 --> 12:59.909
I love you.

13:00.878 --> 13:04.828
Let me give my special little winner
a big, big hug.

13:05.490 --> 13:08.714
Ma. I think I'm all hugged out.

13:08.886 --> 13:11.174
Ah, one more.

13:15.559 --> 13:16.888
Hello, Queen Lisa.

13:17.610 --> 13:18.804
Bart! What are you doing in my room?

13:19.210 --> 13:23.517
Lisa, certain differences, rivalries
if you will, have come up between us.

13:23.692 --> 13:27.610
At first, I thought we could talk it over
like civilized people.

13:27.237 --> 13:32.480
But instead, I just ripped the head
off Mr. Honey Bunny!

13:32.701 --> 13:35.260
Bart, that was your cherished
childhood toy.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.327
Mr. Honey Bunny!

13:40.918 --> 13:43.491
- Quiet down, Bart!
- Bart, just get out of here.

13:43.712 --> 13:46.547
- It's a free country. You get out.
- That doesn't make sense.

13:46.757 --> 13:48.335
I know you are, but what am I?

13:48.550 --> 13:49.879
Get out! Get out!

13:50.520 --> 13:55.129
Okay! But on my way,
I'm gonna be doing this:

13:55.349 --> 13:59.810
If you get hit, it's your own fault.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.804
Okay. Then I'm gonna start
kicking air like this:

14:03.983 --> 14:09.653
And if any part of you should fill that air,
it's your own fault.

14:19.707 --> 14:21.249
I better go check that out.

14:21.458 --> 14:25.408
Now, Homer, don't you eat this pie.

14:25.921 --> 14:27.463
Okay.

14:27.631 --> 14:30.870
All right, pie,
I'm just gonna do this:

14:32.940 --> 14:34.336
And if you get eaten,
it's your own fault.

14:38.851 --> 14:40.974
Oh, my...

14:41.145 --> 14:43.221
Oh, the hell with it.

14:46.525 --> 14:51.104
Stop it! Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Stop it!

14:51.321 --> 14:52.697
Mom, that is really annoying.

14:52.865 --> 14:54.941
- Bart started it.
- Lisa started it.

14:55.159 --> 14:57.780
I don't care who started it!
I don't want to see you...

14:57.995 --> 14:59.573
...fighting like that ever again.

14:59.747 --> 15:02.831
We love you both. You're not
in competition with each other.

15:02.100 --> 15:06.700
Repeat, you are not in competition
with each other.

15:06.879 --> 15:11.588
Hey! Apu just called. This Friday,
Lisa's team is playing Bart's team.

15:11.759 --> 15:13.502
You're in direct competition!

15:13.677 --> 15:16.631
Don't go easy on each other
because you're brother and sister.

15:16.805 --> 15:20.305
I want to see you both fighting
for your parents' love!

15:20.476 --> 15:25.185
Fight! Fight! Fight!

15:29.902 --> 15:32.274
Okay, I'm gonna make
a little deal with you mugs.

15:32.488 --> 15:35.260
I'm gonna let you out to see my team
play the game...

15:35.199 --> 15:37.275
...if you promise to return
to your cells.

15:37.451 --> 15:40.950
Sorry, pig.
We can't make that promise.

15:41.163 --> 15:43.535
All right. All right,
I'll sweeten the deal.

15:43.707 --> 15:46.198
You can see the game,
you don't have to come back...

15:46.377 --> 15:50.457
...but you have to promise
not to commit any more crimes, okay?

15:50.672 --> 15:53.673
- No.
- I'll take that as a yes.

15:53.842 --> 15:56.131
All right, we're free!

15:56.387 --> 16:02.100
At 7 tonight the games begin
Bart versus Lisa, who will win?

16:02.184 --> 16:07.807
Their father's fat and their mother's thin
And Grampa Simpson reeks of gin

16:07.982 --> 16:10.389
Hey!

16:10.567 --> 16:13.272
That's Obsession for Men.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.238
Pass ketchup.

16:18.784 --> 16:22.200
You'll have to do better
than that tonight, chump.

16:23.372 --> 16:27.452
I asked for ketchup!
I'm eating salad here.

16:27.668 --> 16:30.835
I won't have any aggressive
condiment-passing in this house.

16:31.505 --> 16:33.628
- Hello.
- Moe, what are you doing here?

16:33.841 --> 16:37.755
What? What? A bartender can't come by
and say hi to his best customer?

16:37.928 --> 16:41.546
Hey, hey there, Midge. Oh, gee,
I like what you done to your hair.

16:41.765 --> 16:43.639
You caught me
at a real bad time, Moe.

16:43.809 --> 16:46.561
I hope you understand I'm too tense
to pretend I like you.

16:46.770 --> 16:50.353
Yeah, and how are the little kids doing?
I mean, really, how are they doing?

16:50.524 --> 16:53.691
Any disabling injuries? Something
that the gambling community...

16:53.861 --> 16:56.612
...might not yet know about?
Here, let me see those knees.

16:56.780 --> 16:58.274
Moe, I think you should leave.

16:58.490 --> 17:02.109
But Blanche, you gotta help me out here!
Please! I'm 64 grand in the hole!

17:02.328 --> 17:04.404
They're gonna take my thumbs!

17:06.665 --> 17:09.239
Charge!

17:09.792 --> 17:13.493
Good luck tonight, sis.
I'll try not to hurt you!

17:13.672 --> 17:17.717
Don't worry. I'm wearing
my lucky rabbit's head.

17:17.885 --> 17:20.339
Mr. Honey Bunny!
You inhumane monster!

17:20.512 --> 17:22.753
You want a piece of me?

17:22.932 --> 17:24.758
Hey, hey. Stop it, stop it!

17:24.933 --> 17:27.560
Conserve your precious hatred
for the game.

17:27.269 --> 17:29.558
Now that we're all alone, Marge,
admit it.

17:29.730 --> 17:31.473
- You like Lisa best.
- No!

17:31.648 --> 17:33.974
- Oh, so you're a Bart woman, are you?
- No.

17:34.151 --> 17:37.105
You can't possible like Maggie best.
What has she ever done?

17:37.279 --> 17:39.188
Nothing for nobody.

17:39.406 --> 17:41.778
Homer, we can't root for one child
over the other.

17:41.950 --> 17:44.702
You wouldn't like it if the kids
played favorites with us.

17:44.870 --> 17:49.496
- Hey, Mom! Look at me, Mom!
- Hi, Mom, over here! Mom!

17:50.167 --> 17:51.495
Hi, kids.

17:51.710 --> 17:56.880
And now to honor America,
here's Krusty the Clown.

18:12.147 --> 18:15.148
Shouldn't have turned down
those cue cards.

18:27.246 --> 18:28.574
I love Bart!

18:34.860 --> 18:36.430
No, wait! I love Lisa!

18:36.213 --> 18:38.965
Beer? Oh, Marge, I love you.

19:05.340 --> 19:06.611
He tripped my boy!

19:06.785 --> 19:10.154
I demand vengeance!
I want vengeance!

19:10.664 --> 19:13.499
Jimbo Jones called for tripping.

19:13.709 --> 19:16.663
A penalty shot will be taken
by Bart Simpson.

19:18.881 --> 19:21.632
Oh, my God. A penalty shot
with only four seconds left.

19:21.800 --> 19:25.134
It's your child versus mine!
The winner will be showered with praise!

19:25.304 --> 19:28.969
The loser will be taunted and booed
until my throat is sore!

19:33.687 --> 19:35.630
Kill her, boy! Kill her!

19:36.106 --> 19:37.731
Stop him dead, little girl!

19:37.941 --> 19:40.812
Kill, Bart! Kill, Bart! Kill, Bart!

19:40.986 --> 19:44.153
Kill Bart! Kill Bart! Kill Bart!

19:48.702 --> 19:52.710
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

20:41.460 --> 20:42.706
Great game, Lis.

20:42.881 --> 20:45.419
Great game, Bart.

20:49.555 --> 20:51.346
- Tie game?!
- What the hell?!

20:51.515 --> 20:52.843
This is outrageous.

20:53.160 --> 20:57.970
Oh, I've never been so proud of them.

21:00.274 --> 21:03.275
They're both losers. Losers!

21:03.485 --> 21:06.854
- Rip off!
- We paid for blood!

21:07.720 --> 21:08.899
Let's tear this place apart!

21:09.116 --> 21:10.907
Good idea!

21:16.373 --> 21:20.371
Those kids are, like, so sweet.

21:21.211 --> 21:26.170
If only they had had Pee Wee
hockey when I was a lad.

21:27.920 --> 21:28.919
Oh, well.

22:30.990 --> 22:33.660
