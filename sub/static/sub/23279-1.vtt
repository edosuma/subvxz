02:26.847 --> 02:29.081
I never know
how to answer that question.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.917
Uh, let me think. I...

02:31.919 --> 02:33.585
I'm always on time.

02:33.587 --> 02:36.855
I'm... I'm very organized
with my life like that.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.257
I'm...

02:38.259 --> 02:40.559
I plan well.
I'm a planner.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.728
I'm also very flexible, though.

02:43.630 --> 02:46.498
Flexible. And, um...

02:46.500 --> 02:48.634
I think that
my greatest strength, though,

02:48.636 --> 02:51.170
is that I anticipate
future problems

02:51.172 --> 02:52.938
and I prepare for them.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.578
Oh, my god.
I am-- I'm so sorry.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.846
- It's okay.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.948
Mmm-- I thought
I turned it off.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.716
You can take that.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.720
No...

03:08.722 --> 03:10.189
It's okay, um...

03:11.124 --> 03:12.191
Where were we?

03:14.228 --> 03:16.995
You have one new voice message.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.263
Faye.

03:19.632 --> 03:21.900
Argene will be here
for the second interviews.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.769
Are you free for the 29th?

03:25.171 --> 03:27.573
Really? I mean-- yes.

03:27.575 --> 03:31.376
Yes. I will be here.
Thank you.

03:36.082 --> 03:38.617
Hi, sweetie, it's Dina.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.886
I'm sorry I'm calling, but...

03:41.354 --> 03:42.721
It's Ronnie.

03:43.423 --> 03:45.090
She's getting worse.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.558
Her drinking's out of control,

03:46.560 --> 03:50.829
and today she had an accident
with the lawn mower.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.398
I don't know if you can
make the drive, but...

03:54.300 --> 03:55.901
We don't know how to help her.

04:38.345 --> 04:41.346
She stood still, he spun around,

04:41.348 --> 04:44.349
he took a spill, she fell down.

04:57.730 --> 04:59.598
--It's open.

05:01.334 --> 05:02.734
In the kitchen.

05:10.276 --> 05:13.679
Faye! Hi!

05:13.681 --> 05:15.781
How was the drive?
You made good time.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.249
Yeah. No traffic.

05:17.251 --> 05:18.583
You just get off work?

05:18.585 --> 05:21.253
- No.
- I just can't get enough of this uniform.

05:21.255 --> 05:24.456
Uh, that was on the porch,

05:24.891 --> 05:25.957
I did not make it.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.225
Thank god for that.

05:27.227 --> 05:29.995
Ronnie's gonna be
really glad to see you.

05:29.997 --> 05:34.166
I know it's been hard to
keep in touch. You being away.

05:34.168 --> 05:35.834
But best friends forever, right?

05:38.004 --> 05:39.538
Where is our little angel?

05:42.008 --> 05:43.642
Follow the bread crumbs.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.343
When Dina said you had an
accident with the lawn mower,

06:18.345 --> 06:20.379
I figured you'd
pissed yourself...

06:21.013 --> 06:22.581
While lawn mowing.

06:27.353 --> 06:28.920
What are you doing here?

06:29.956 --> 06:33.392
Besides just stealing
my undies, perv.

06:36.095 --> 06:37.929
Dina's worried about you.

06:37.931 --> 06:41.133
She thinks you've become
a danger to yourself, but...

06:41.901 --> 06:42.868
Now that I've seen you,

06:42.870 --> 06:45.404
I've no idea
what she's talking about.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.746
Wanna hear something funny?

06:58.918 --> 07:00.152
This was his shirt.

07:02.455 --> 07:05.257
I know. I gave it to him.

07:05.259 --> 07:08.059
That creed concert
was our first date.

07:08.061 --> 07:11.296
How the fuck was
there a second date?

07:11.298 --> 07:12.597
I like creed.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.634
Well, no wonder he dumped you.

07:21.707 --> 07:24.176
Wanna hear something
even funnier?

07:24.178 --> 07:27.045
I would like to hear something
that's actually funny.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.682
These are his pants.

07:32.251 --> 07:34.586
What is in these?

07:34.588 --> 07:37.289
They're like paint pants.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.758
It's no wonder
he got ball cancer.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.562
This is nice.
Kind of like old times.

07:45.932 --> 07:48.233
So Faye, hon,
Ronnie told me you got a job.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.368
A blow job.

07:50.370 --> 07:53.438
Not yet. I just passed
the first interview.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.475
But I wouldn't be
a real teacher yet, just...

07:56.477 --> 07:57.843
Just an art docent.

07:57.845 --> 08:01.213
Mmm.
An art docent.

08:01.215 --> 08:05.150
It's, uh... It's like a
teacher's assistant.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.218
A job's a job.

08:06.220 --> 08:07.986
Just adopt her already.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.254
Where is it?

08:09.256 --> 08:11.323
Um, Vancouver.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.791
That's far.

08:14.026 --> 08:15.193
Yeah, it is.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.529
Well, your parents
must be really proud, Faye.

08:17.531 --> 08:18.763
Yeah, they might be proud

08:18.765 --> 08:20.932
if they remembered
that they were parents.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.067
Veronica.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.468
I'm sorry. I'm drunk.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.537
We're gonna have to
make you a name tag.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.507
Have some water, Ronnie.

08:32.745 --> 08:34.746
- Can you eat?
- Mm-hmm.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.283
Ms. Dunaway.

08:41.153 --> 08:42.220
Smells great.

09:56.729 --> 09:59.197
Don't swallow it.
Spit it out.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.632
Spit it out.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.991
Good morning, sunshine.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.161
Mmm. What's happening?

12:43.629 --> 12:44.963
What do you mean?

12:45.765 --> 12:47.766
Are we in the mustang?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.368
Why are we in Garrett's car?

12:50.370 --> 12:52.003
Are we in a car?

12:54.707 --> 12:56.808
Did you kidnap me?

12:56.810 --> 12:59.010
Okay, that's a tad dramatic.

12:59.012 --> 13:02.213
We are going to Invermere.

13:04.183 --> 13:07.285
No, no, Faye, no.
Pull over, please.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.120
No, don't worry.
I packed your night things.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.622
- Pull over.
- We're all set.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.258
Pull the fuck over, Faye!

13:20.299 --> 13:21.800
Turn around.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.035
No.

13:24.336 --> 13:25.870
Fine.

13:25.872 --> 13:27.906
Okay, what are you
gonna do? Walk home?

13:27.908 --> 13:31.342
What is the big deal?

13:31.344 --> 13:32.710
Invermere is cool.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.245
Invermere is not cool.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.114
Invermere is boring
and fucking quiet.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.682
And that's not even
the goddamn point

13:37.684 --> 13:39.017
because you abducted me!

13:39.019 --> 13:40.718
We are going on vacation.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.188
It's gonna be fun.
Like old times.

13:43.190 --> 13:46.057
Faye, my brother
just fucking died.

13:47.459 --> 13:49.294
I'm well aware of that, Ronnie.

13:50.429 --> 13:53.565
And he didn't just die.
He died two months ago.

13:53.567 --> 13:57.168
Oh, give me a fucking break.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.471
We are going
to a summer cottage.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.574
It's not a rehab facility.

14:02.576 --> 14:04.342
I don't need a rehab facility.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.778
Your dinner table
on which you vomited

14:06.780 --> 14:08.479
would beg to differ.

14:08.481 --> 14:09.714
Fuck you!

14:21.995 --> 14:23.294
I'll be in the car.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.733
I'm not going to be pleasant.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.435
I would never ask you to change.

14:47.853 --> 14:49.954
Hi, it's Faye Baxter.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.457
I was-- I was in yesterday.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.993
I'm so sorry. This is--
This is really unlike me,

14:54.995 --> 14:59.030
but I'm not gonna be able
to come in on the 29th.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.632
This opportunity is really...

15:00.634 --> 15:02.567
Hey, honey.
Hop in the pussy wagon.

15:02.569 --> 15:06.104
Okay, okay.

15:06.106 --> 15:09.040
--Sorry, what was that?

15:09.042 --> 15:12.777
Skype? Yes, Skype--
Skype would be perfect.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.045
Thank you. Uh--

15:14.047 --> 15:16.547
I really appreciate it, Helen.
Thank you so much.

15:29.462 --> 15:32.163
- Hey, look what you've done.
- Hey, ladies.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.401
Oh, hey, you got
any more of those?

15:36.403 --> 15:37.869
Maybe.

15:37.871 --> 15:39.470
Can we get a couple?

15:39.472 --> 15:41.005
Can we see your jugs?

15:41.007 --> 15:42.840
--Do not do it, Ronnie.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.676
He wants to see my jugs.

15:45.411 --> 15:46.744
How about one jug?

15:46.746 --> 15:48.613
Then you get one beer.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.381
--Ta-da!

15:50.383 --> 15:50.381
Oh, yeah!

15:50.383 --> 15:52.817
- Deal's a deal.

15:52.819 --> 15:55.586
Come on. Yes!

15:55.588 --> 15:56.821
Ronnie!

15:56.823 --> 15:58.323
Okay, did you want one?

15:58.325 --> 16:00.658
Oi! Oi, boys!

16:04.964 --> 16:06.898
Yeah!

16:06.900 --> 16:09.067
Pleasure doing
business with you!

16:10.638 --> 16:11.537
Great, perfect.

16:11.538 --> 16:15.173
Now they're probably just
gonna follow us and stalk us.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.475
Yeah, that's not likely.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.645
But I like that you think
that my tits are that powerful.

16:22.081 --> 16:24.382
I wish my tits
were that powerful.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.464
You guys move the hide-a-key?

17:19.905 --> 17:22.140
You don't know?

17:22.142 --> 17:24.575
You do know.
You're just not gonna tell me.

18:05.517 --> 18:06.617
Yes!

18:11.824 --> 18:13.224
It's not even noon.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.393
You're gonna drink that?

18:17.062 --> 18:19.263
- Mmm!
- You're drinking just...

18:19.265 --> 18:20.798
Are you gonna
narrate the whole trip

18:20.800 --> 18:22.300
or just the arrival portion?

18:25.003 --> 18:26.571
What do you wanna do today?

18:26.573 --> 18:29.073
I just bought
these amazing beads,

18:29.075 --> 18:32.443
so we could
make friendship bracelets...

18:34.980 --> 18:36.047
Good one.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.688
Come on, Ronnie.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.242
Oh, yeah.

20:38.670 --> 20:42.206
Hey, let's go to town.
I'm out of weed.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.975
Maybe this could be
an opportunity for you.

20:43.977 --> 20:45.276
For what?

20:45.278 --> 20:47.311
To stay out of weed.

20:47.313 --> 20:48.679
Where are the keys? I'll drive.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.081
No.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.417
We can bike.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.785
There's only one bike.

20:55.454 --> 20:57.288
We can ride it together.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.523
Lesbian.

21:00.859 --> 21:04.695
Oh! What's this?

21:04.697 --> 21:07.064
"The fun schedule."

21:07.066 --> 21:10.468
We're not just gonna sit
around the cabin all day, so...

21:11.169 --> 21:12.570
I planned some stuff.

21:14.139 --> 21:15.740
Snack break.

21:15.742 --> 21:19.210
You know how you get
when your blood sugar drops.

21:19.212 --> 21:20.544
Okay, well,

21:20.546 --> 21:22.580
we gotta get to the market
or else it's gonna close.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.081
Then we'll have to go tomorrow

21:24.083 --> 21:25.316
- and we're gonna miss this.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.451
Blacksmithy lesson.

21:42.567 --> 21:44.168
Hey,
we should go to the pharmacy.

21:44.170 --> 21:44.168
Why?

21:44.170 --> 21:46.704
Uh, I don't know.
We could get some...

21:46.706 --> 21:48.539
No, I stocked up before we left.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.341
No, just--
Ronnie!

21:50.343 --> 21:52.009
Ronnie! What!

21:52.011 --> 21:53.077
Ronnie.

21:55.614 --> 21:57.648
Alex! Hi!

21:57.650 --> 21:57.648
Hi.

21:57.650 --> 22:01.552
I thought that I would see you.
I had a premonition.

22:01.554 --> 22:01.552
Yeah?

22:01.554 --> 22:06.424
I-- I got your message. I'm sorry
that I didn't call you back.

22:06.958 --> 22:08.392
Um...

22:08.860 --> 22:10.528
Alex, this is Faye.

22:11.596 --> 22:12.663
Faye.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.099
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.367
You're tall.

22:17.035 --> 22:18.469
Thank you.

22:19.237 --> 22:20.771
So, you guys want anything?

22:21.239 --> 22:22.640
Candy?

22:22.642 --> 22:24.508
No, no, you know, we're
actually kind of on a mission,

22:24.510 --> 22:26.110
so we should hit it.

22:27.479 --> 22:29.880
- Okay. Candy.

22:31.184 --> 22:32.583
Quick. Quickly.

22:32.585 --> 22:33.818
Yes!

22:36.755 --> 22:39.123
So, what kind of mission
are you guys on?

22:39.125 --> 22:40.491
Ronnie wants ganja.

22:40.493 --> 22:42.293
Where are you headed?

22:42.295 --> 22:45.229
Uh... you know Shamus
from the launderette?

22:45.231 --> 22:46.697
Oh, he can't help you.

22:46.699 --> 22:46.697
Oh...

22:46.699 --> 22:49.667
I don't know.
I used to give him hand jobs.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.902
No, I mean he's dry.
He got busted.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.037
Oh, my god, like jail?

22:53.039 --> 22:55.740
No, uh, just by his mom.

22:59.478 --> 23:01.145
Why don't you guys
come by my place tonight?

23:01.147 --> 23:02.346
I've got a guy.

23:02.348 --> 23:04.849
Oh... uh... no.
I don't think we can.

23:04.851 --> 23:08.285
- Uh, tomorrow?
- Uh, yeah... maybe, maybe,

23:08.287 --> 23:10.454
but so sorry,
we're kind of on a schedule.

23:10.456 --> 23:13.257
So...
We'll be in touch.

23:13.259 --> 23:14.692
Uh... take it easy, Alex.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.761
--It's fine, it's fine.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.164
- Nice meeting you.
- -So nice.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.432
Thank you.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.671
"We'll be in touch"?

23:27.673 --> 23:29.340
I didn't know
how to deal with that, man,

23:29.342 --> 23:30.908
she's the weirdest.

23:37.482 --> 23:40.418
You can't even wait
until we get home?

23:40.420 --> 23:42.586
Nah, I don't have
to wait till I get home.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.957
Can't re-grow
your liver, Ronnie.

23:46.959 --> 23:49.627
Hey, why don't we focus
on you for a little while?

23:50.195 --> 23:51.996
You know what can regrow?

23:51.998 --> 23:53.230
Your hymen.

23:53.232 --> 23:54.765
No, it can't.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.801
Can it?

23:56.803 --> 23:58.736
Who was the last guy you fucked?

24:00.305 --> 24:02.706
If you say Garrett,
I'm gonna poop.

24:02.708 --> 24:06.343
Okay, it wasn't Garrett.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.012
How many
have there been since Garrett?

24:08.014 --> 24:09.580
- One.
- One.

24:10.248 --> 24:11.515
What was his name?

24:12.017 --> 24:13.684
David.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.553
What color were his pubes?

24:16.521 --> 24:18.956
I think they were like...

24:19.991 --> 24:21.492
Calico...

24:23.129 --> 24:24.662
Okay.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.430
I haven't slept with anyone.

24:26.432 --> 24:28.432
Good.

24:28.434 --> 24:29.733
That settles it.

24:29.735 --> 24:33.137
Operation get Faye laid
starts right now.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.438
Put it on the fun schedule.

24:34.440 --> 24:37.308
Okay, it's not like
I can't get laid.

24:37.310 --> 24:38.776
I wanna play, too.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.911
Operation get Ronnie laid...

24:40.913 --> 24:42.580
Also, starts now.

24:42.582 --> 24:45.149
Uh, it's always
operation get Ronnie laid.

24:48.854 --> 24:50.187
Land ho!

25:00.465 --> 25:02.933
I'm not vaccinated for this.

25:10.375 --> 25:11.842
Well, now...

25:13.513 --> 25:16.080
I knew there was a reason
I skipped work today.

25:17.449 --> 25:19.283
Girls, you got a band-aid.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.452
No, but I could use
some disinfectant.

25:22.588 --> 25:23.888
What do you need
a band-aid for?

25:23.890 --> 25:27.024
Well, it's just
for all these cuts. Pow!

25:30.229 --> 25:31.595
Can I buy you a drink?

25:31.597 --> 25:33.163
- No, thank you.
- Absolutely.

25:33.165 --> 25:34.565
Bobby?

25:34.567 --> 25:36.967
Gonna need a couple
of brews for these angels

25:36.969 --> 25:37.835
on my tab.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.236
Oh, my god, you have a tab?

25:39.238 --> 25:41.338
- I sure do.
- That's so cool.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.973
- You like that?
- Yeah!

25:44.377 --> 25:46.343
You know you ought
to come back on Sundays.

25:46.345 --> 25:48.312
We do a little
mud wrestling thing and...

25:48.314 --> 25:50.881
You know, if you get
dirty, you drink for free.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.583
- Shit! What a deal!
- Mmm.

25:52.585 --> 25:53.717
Sign me up.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.519
Well, I will. What's your name?

25:55.521 --> 25:56.587
Ronnie.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.722
Ronnie, the wrestler.
I like that.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.091
They call me Dale.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.393
You wanna dance?

26:02.395 --> 26:03.561
I'd love to dance.

26:03.563 --> 26:05.129
And how about you, red?

26:06.231 --> 26:07.798
No, thank you, dandruff.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.834
Whoa... this is
protein powder, I think.

26:11.369 --> 26:12.536
Can we just go?

26:12.538 --> 26:15.339
Hey, we're gonna
need a couple of shots.

26:15.341 --> 26:16.574
Tequila!

26:16.576 --> 26:18.976
- Ready. One, two, three.
- -Okay.

26:21.479 --> 26:22.913
Ugh...

26:23.882 --> 26:25.049
Mmm.

26:39.464 --> 26:40.731
I like the pink ones.

26:40.733 --> 26:41.865
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:41.867 --> 26:43.233
Go, red, you've come to life.

26:44.537 --> 26:45.803
Cheers to that.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.304
Yeah!

27:56.341 --> 27:59.109
No, no. Where are you going?
Red, come back.

28:00.311 --> 28:01.378
She'll be all right.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.247
Come here, you.

28:35.114 --> 28:37.448
She stood still, he spun around,

28:37.450 --> 28:39.717
he took a spill,
and she fell down.

28:39.719 --> 28:41.752
She stood still,
and he spun around,

28:41.754 --> 28:44.054
he took a spill,
and she fell down.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.924
She stood still,
and he spun around,

28:46.926 --> 28:48.826
he took a spill,
and she fell down.

28:51.597 --> 28:53.130
She stood still,
and he spun around,

28:53.132 --> 28:55.132
he took a spill,
and she fell down.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.744
- Ronnie...
- Whoa...

29:40.746 --> 29:41.912
We're kind of busy in here.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.680
--Get off, please.

29:43.682 --> 29:45.115
No, I have a mission.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.717
You heard.
She has a mission.

29:46.719 --> 29:48.886
Okay, let's abort mission.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.554
- No...
- -Seriously.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.556
No, can't do, soldier.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.224
I have a duty...

29:54.226 --> 29:54.224
To my vagina.

29:54.226 --> 29:57.161
- She has a duty, red.

29:57.163 --> 30:00.364
What about her duty?

30:00.366 --> 30:04.334
Red, red, the future
of all mankind depends on it.

30:05.270 --> 30:07.304
Are you seriously
just gonna leave me like this?

30:07.739 --> 30:09.273
Husband!

31:37.362 --> 31:39.062
- Hey!
- Hi.

31:39.998 --> 31:41.765
No Ronnie this morning?

31:41.767 --> 31:43.133
She's still sleeping.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.035
- You know Ronnie.

31:45.037 --> 31:46.470
I don't know her
that well, actually.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.372
I only met them last summer.

31:48.374 --> 31:49.673
Oh, you knew Garrett?

31:49.675 --> 31:51.041
Mm-hmm.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.278
Right on.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.880
Hey, what are you
doing tonight? I think, um...

31:56.882 --> 31:58.515
I think Ronnie and I
might kill each other

31:58.517 --> 32:01.251
if we don't spend some time
with some other people.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.220
I was gonna barbecue
around 7:00.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.155
You should come.

32:05.157 --> 32:07.090
Uh, Ronnie
can give you directions.

32:08.092 --> 32:09.159
Cool.

32:10.862 --> 32:12.496
Guess I'll see you tonight then.

32:13.865 --> 32:15.399
Did you want some candy?

32:16.668 --> 32:18.335
Yes, yes, I did.

32:56.241 --> 33:00.310
You're up.
Ready for vision boards?

33:00.312 --> 33:01.511
No!

33:05.383 --> 33:06.550
Very funny.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.558
You ever made
a vision board before?

33:14.560 --> 33:17.060
Hmm. Of course not.
That would actually

33:17.062 --> 33:19.096
require thought
about the future.

33:21.032 --> 33:23.700
Why does it say,
"Alex, BBQ" on there?

33:23.702 --> 33:25.469
Oh, I ran into her downtown.

33:25.471 --> 33:27.204
She invited us over.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.006
Well, maybe we can just tell her

33:29.008 --> 33:30.774
we're on the master cleanse
or something.

33:30.776 --> 33:31.942
She'll understand.

33:31.944 --> 33:34.011
What else
are we gonna do tonight?

33:35.546 --> 33:36.747
White house.

33:36.749 --> 33:37.948
We'll hit the white house again.

33:37.950 --> 33:40.584
As appealing as that sounds,

33:41.386 --> 33:43.353
I think I'm gonna go to Alex's.

33:49.260 --> 33:52.229
Are you guys like...
Not-friends?

33:52.730 --> 33:53.797
Friendly.

33:57.301 --> 33:58.702
How do you know her again?

33:58.704 --> 34:00.237
Ah! She's like one of Garrett's

34:00.239 --> 34:02.039
random friends
from summers here.

34:02.041 --> 34:04.174
I...
I just don't wanna go.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.942
Okay.

34:05.944 --> 34:07.310
You don't have to.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.614
So, you're just gonna go
over there all by yourself?

34:12.949 --> 34:14.217
Yeah.

34:19.157 --> 34:21.491
Like, you don't even know her.

34:21.493 --> 34:24.694
Not as well
as you know, say, Dale.

34:24.696 --> 34:26.663
But, uh, I think I'll survive.

35:01.566 --> 35:02.632
They're here.

35:04.135 --> 35:05.402
Hello, ladies.

35:05.404 --> 35:08.105
Uh, Ronnie, Faye, this is
my roommate, Granville.

35:08.107 --> 35:09.539
You can call me "granny."

35:09.941 --> 35:11.408
Who likes beer?

35:11.410 --> 35:13.810
Grab a bunch.
We'll be in the garden.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.147
Uh... bathroom?

35:17.149 --> 35:18.715
Just around the corner.

35:18.717 --> 35:18.715
Uh, just make sure you hold

35:18.717 --> 35:21.785
the flusher down
for three Mississippi's

35:26.224 --> 35:28.492
she doesn't know about you.

35:28.494 --> 35:29.593
Okay.

35:30.361 --> 35:32.896
Faye... she can't
know about you.

35:32.898 --> 35:34.231
Okay.

35:34.233 --> 35:36.666
Alex, this is super important.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.001
She can't know about you.

35:38.003 --> 35:39.269
Ronnie...

35:39.670 --> 35:40.804
It's okay.

35:42.306 --> 35:44.508
Okay, okay.

36:01.859 --> 36:02.926
Do you like space?

36:04.795 --> 36:07.097
- Yeah.

36:07.099 --> 36:09.166
It's okay if
you're not that into it.

36:11.469 --> 36:13.303
Not that into it.

36:13.971 --> 36:15.972
Get out of my house.

36:15.974 --> 36:19.309
No, I'm kidding. That's a joke.
Please stay.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.578
Hmm.

36:25.083 --> 36:26.550
So, you're an artist?

36:26.817 --> 36:26.816
Uh...

36:26.818 --> 36:31.288
Yeah, space enthusiast, really.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.756
Made a ton of these.

36:32.758 --> 36:35.125
Got a bunch in my bedroom
if you want to...

36:35.127 --> 36:37.227
Uh... or...

36:37.229 --> 36:38.828
People are waiting outside, too.

36:39.530 --> 36:40.864
So...

36:40.866 --> 36:41.932
Uh, nice to meet you.

36:41.934 --> 36:44.401
Uh, I'll get the chips.

36:51.309 --> 36:53.243
- What do you got?
- Beer.

36:53.245 --> 36:55.679
Uh, granny, I promised them
some of your Kush.

36:55.681 --> 36:57.948
Oh, shit, Kenny
cleaned me out this morning.

36:57.950 --> 37:01.117
- Fuck...
- -Aren't those marijuana plants?

37:01.119 --> 37:03.453
Yeah. But they're not
ready for harvest yet.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.389
Did you ever, uh,
see one up close?

37:07.058 --> 37:08.325
I'll show you.

37:09.527 --> 37:12.229
Oh, no, that's cool.
I see them all the time.

37:14.398 --> 37:15.865
Please, after you.

37:26.310 --> 37:27.410
It's pollen.

37:27.412 --> 37:28.878
It's my kryptonite.

37:31.782 --> 37:32.983
They're pretty, huh?

37:33.517 --> 37:34.651
Very pretty.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.593
What's that?

37:43.595 --> 37:46.696
Oh, that is my pump for Insulin.

37:46.698 --> 37:47.864
I'm diabetic.

37:48.466 --> 37:49.532
Ta-da!

37:52.270 --> 37:54.037
You have diabetes and asthma?

37:54.705 --> 37:55.772
Yes, I do.

37:56.374 --> 37:58.308
Basically superman.

38:01.579 --> 38:04.281
Yo, hookers. We got a plan B.

38:04.482 --> 38:05.715
Uh-oh...

38:05.717 --> 38:06.750
What is it?

38:06.752 --> 38:09.019
Alex said she can take us
to the bowling alley

38:09.021 --> 38:11.021
to meet some guys
on the weekend.

38:11.023 --> 38:12.622
Ooh! Can you score
some weed there?

38:12.624 --> 38:14.958
Yeah, bro, we can score
some weed there.

38:16.327 --> 38:18.495
--That Shamus?

38:19.297 --> 38:21.698
Gonna get that
famous-Shamus-stank-weed.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.801
Better than nothing, I guess.

38:28.406 --> 38:30.340
Granville's kind of a cutie.

38:30.741 --> 38:32.575
He's not.

38:32.577 --> 38:35.812
Come on. You were creaming
your Jean shorts for that guy.

38:36.447 --> 38:40.483
Asthmatic, diabetic...

38:40.485 --> 38:41.985
Space cowboy Granville.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.753
Shut up.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.293
- Why?
- Come on. You're not even gonna get in once?

38:50.295 --> 38:53.630
No. I don't
want swimmer's itch.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.598
You're not gonna get it again.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.168
Oh, my god.
It's not like chicken pox.

38:58.170 --> 39:00.470
It's itchy for, like, a week.

39:00.472 --> 39:02.605
Boo-hoo!
We've all had chlamydia.

39:09.513 --> 39:10.413
Mmm.

39:10.415 --> 39:11.748
Life is so hard.

39:12.416 --> 39:14.617
Ronnie! The sun!

39:14.619 --> 39:18.088
Oh, my god. The sun,
the water. Jesus, Faye.

39:18.090 --> 39:19.155
Live a little.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.256
Yeah, I'm trying to live a lot,

39:20.258 --> 39:22.592
which is why
I'm avoiding a sunburn.

39:22.594 --> 39:23.827
What's the point, dude?

39:23.829 --> 39:26.096
You're probably gonna
get melanoma anyways.

39:27.164 --> 39:28.865
Okay, not to get
all Oprah on you,

39:28.867 --> 39:28.865
but I don't love that

39:28.867 --> 39:31.968
you're putting that out
into the universe.

39:33.771 --> 39:36.873
It's not like Garrett
microwaved his balls.

39:39.610 --> 39:41.978
That was genetic.
He was always gonna get it.

39:43.514 --> 39:46.383
Well, maybe you're always
gonna get skin cancer.

39:46.385 --> 39:48.184
So, might as well
enjoy a little pigment

39:48.186 --> 39:49.552
while you're young.

39:49.554 --> 39:52.021
Ooh! Live like you're
gonna die tomorrow.

39:52.023 --> 39:53.490
How original.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.893
Spit it out.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.128
What?

39:58.130 --> 40:00.130
I'm not ashamed of my behavior.

40:00.132 --> 40:01.564
Okay, Ronnie.

40:02.099 --> 40:03.600
You're being judgy.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.402
I didn't say anything.

40:05.404 --> 40:07.437
Well, you're being judgy
without saying anything.

40:07.439 --> 40:11.074
So, either speak your mind
or shut the fuck up.

40:11.076 --> 40:14.043
Okay. I think you're being
reckless and irresponsible.

40:15.479 --> 40:17.847
I'm just having fun.

40:17.849 --> 40:20.417
Dale's truck could not
have been fun.

40:21.152 --> 40:22.218
You wouldn't recognize fun

40:22.220 --> 40:24.087
if it was sucking
on your puffy nips.

40:25.189 --> 40:26.623
I have fun.

40:26.957 --> 40:26.956
Prove it.

40:26.958 --> 40:30.160
Prove you're
not using drunken sex

40:30.162 --> 40:31.494
as a coping mechanism.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.631
I was slutty
before Garrett died.

40:34.633 --> 40:37.467
It's who I am.
It's my fucking right.

40:37.469 --> 40:39.736
Garrett would be so proud.

40:39.738 --> 40:42.672
Why would I wanna
make Garrett proud?

40:42.674 --> 40:45.041
He was a fucking pussy.

40:45.043 --> 40:47.076
And I didn't take his advice
when he was alive,

40:47.078 --> 40:48.845
I'm not gonna start now.

40:48.847 --> 40:52.515
I cannot believe you're
talking about him like this.

40:52.517 --> 40:56.085
Oh, my god. It's insane
you're defending him.

41:50.541 --> 41:52.876
Girls, these are the guys.

41:52.878 --> 41:55.278
Oh, I see we're just
in time for the gang-bang.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.580
These odds can only help you.

41:57.582 --> 41:58.715
Does anyone want a beer?

41:58.717 --> 41:59.983
Yeah, a beer would be divine.

41:59.985 --> 42:02.619
Why, yes,
a beer would be divine.

42:02.621 --> 42:04.487
Are you gonna be
like this all night?

42:04.489 --> 42:06.523
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Shamus.

42:06.525 --> 42:07.824
It's been a while.

42:08.559 --> 42:11.294
Welcome to my bowling alley.

42:11.296 --> 42:14.163
Hey, Zach, why don't you get
these ladies some shoes?

42:15.232 --> 42:16.299
10 and a half, men's.

42:16.934 --> 42:20.403
I'm 7. Clean.

42:20.405 --> 42:21.571
What's this?

42:21.573 --> 42:23.540
This right here is my calling.

42:23.542 --> 42:25.275
Practice makes perfect.

42:25.277 --> 42:26.643
It's permanent.

42:26.645 --> 42:29.212
Well, the boys help out
with that. Don't you, guys?

42:29.214 --> 42:30.713
Go ahead. Show her.

42:34.218 --> 42:35.585
Oh...

42:35.587 --> 42:36.953
I passed out with my shoes on.

42:36.955 --> 42:38.621
Aww... sweet lisp.

42:38.923 --> 42:40.223
Ronnie!

42:40.225 --> 42:42.959
It's okay. Faye used to have
a stutter.

42:42.961 --> 42:44.861
She did this stutter poem
to get rid of it.

42:44.863 --> 42:46.896
You should teach him
the stutter poem.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.565
Cut it out.

42:48.567 --> 42:50.800
So, uh, Alex tells me
you guys are looking

42:50.802 --> 42:53.136
for some of that farm-to-table
devil's lettuce.

42:54.204 --> 42:55.371
You've come to the right place.

42:55.373 --> 42:57.006
I don't know.
Word on the street

42:57.008 --> 42:58.575
is your mama busted you.

42:58.577 --> 43:01.044
Yeah, she might have
busted me, but, uh...

43:01.046 --> 43:03.446
She didn't bust
my man Tommy over here.

43:03.448 --> 43:04.714
Hook 'em up.

43:05.549 --> 43:07.250
Now this stuff here...

43:07.252 --> 43:08.918
It's my very own strain.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.554
We call it
"the walk of Shamus."

43:13.158 --> 43:15.458
Mmm. Is it really such a good
idea to have it out there

43:15.460 --> 43:17.560
just Willy-nilly?

43:17.562 --> 43:18.628
Chill, Faye.

43:18.630 --> 43:20.597
I'm chill. Thank you.

43:20.599 --> 43:21.698
It's cool.
Shamus runs the place.

43:21.700 --> 43:23.299
There's no one here to bust us.

43:26.503 --> 43:28.004
Oh, she doesn't smoke.

43:41.185 --> 43:43.720
All right! Let's bowl.

44:39.710 --> 44:41.144
So, those are called "quasars."

44:41.745 --> 44:43.780
Or quasi-stellar objects.

44:45.049 --> 44:48.117
Well, basically,
they're like stars.

44:48.119 --> 44:50.553
Except not quite,
hence the name.

44:50.555 --> 44:52.088
"Quasi."

44:52.090 --> 44:54.290
Because they're
brighter than stars.

44:54.292 --> 44:57.827
So they can be brighter
than entire galaxies.

44:57.829 --> 45:01.164
What's so magnificent
about them is that

45:01.166 --> 45:05.201
they're powered by the stuff that
gets sucked into black holes.

45:05.203 --> 45:07.537
I mean, "suck" is
the wrong word. Fall.

45:07.539 --> 45:09.038
Fall. Fall is better.

45:09.040 --> 45:12.108
So, like, mass falls
into a black hole, dies,

45:12.110 --> 45:14.143
and then its energy
gets converted

45:14.145 --> 45:17.380
into the brilliant light
of the quasi-stellar object.

45:18.615 --> 45:19.782
I mean, how cool is that?

45:19.784 --> 45:21.784
You know, the darkest, most...

45:21.786 --> 45:23.486
Mysterious thing
in the universe,

45:23.488 --> 45:25.021
this hole of death,

45:25.023 --> 45:28.157
feeds the brightest
and most beautiful.

45:29.993 --> 45:32.095
You really like space, huh?

45:34.164 --> 45:35.364
I also like puns.

45:36.767 --> 45:38.601
Oh, all right.

45:38.603 --> 45:40.636
Let's hear a pun.

45:40.638 --> 45:43.072
Oh, I-- I can't
just tell you a pun.

45:43.407 --> 45:45.141
Why not?

45:45.143 --> 45:47.777
My-my-my puns
don't work that way.

45:49.780 --> 45:51.547
'Cause they're unemployed.

45:51.549 --> 45:52.982
One might say
they're "pun-employed."

45:52.984 --> 45:55.451
--That's stupid.

46:13.003 --> 46:14.403
Do you want to get out of here?

46:15.205 --> 46:16.439
Yes, absolutely.

46:20.544 --> 46:22.879
--Oh...

46:24.381 --> 46:25.815
Two down.

46:27.184 --> 46:28.885
What about our ride?

46:28.887 --> 46:31.387
Don't worry, ladies.
I'll take you home.

47:08.826 --> 47:10.226
Let's go downstairs.

47:30.914 --> 47:32.682
Ah!

47:33.918 --> 47:36.052
- Sorry.
- It's okay. It's all right.

47:47.064 --> 47:48.464
You okay?

47:50.300 --> 47:51.434
I just have to pee.

48:41.618 --> 48:43.653
Hmm...

49:15.919 --> 49:18.120
Hey? Hey, good-lookin',
we're here.

49:19.389 --> 49:20.489
Hi!

49:21.558 --> 49:23.292
--Oh!

49:26.830 --> 49:28.698
Oh, hey-- you-you okay?

49:38.843 --> 49:40.109
You good?

49:40.744 --> 49:43.446
Hey, what-- what happened here?

49:45.782 --> 49:47.049
Mmm.

49:47.718 --> 49:49.518
Sometimes life gets ya.

49:50.620 --> 49:51.887
But do you know what they say?

49:51.889 --> 49:55.091
They say that if you
have two black eyes,

49:55.093 --> 49:57.593
the universe is
telling you to take a nap.

49:57.595 --> 49:59.428
But if it's just one of them,

49:59.430 --> 50:01.831
- then it's a wink.

50:01.833 --> 50:03.532
Hey, what are you waiting for?

50:04.769 --> 50:06.402
Look, I'm gonna take off.

50:06.837 --> 50:07.903
What?

50:07.905 --> 50:10.873
Look, my grandma died last year.

50:10.875 --> 50:12.208
It's super hard, I get it.

50:12.210 --> 50:14.377
- Yeah, I bet that was hard.

50:14.379 --> 50:15.511
Unlike your dick.

50:17.381 --> 50:18.748
I'm gonna go.

50:18.750 --> 50:21.050
Ha-ha! Hey,
you need an invitation?

50:21.052 --> 50:22.852
You a vampire?

50:22.854 --> 50:24.920
Cross the threshold, vampire!

50:24.922 --> 50:26.789
Dross-- no, "cross."

50:27.524 --> 50:28.858
Cross the threshold!

50:28.860 --> 50:30.226
Drink some water.

50:30.961 --> 50:32.895
Drink water...

50:32.897 --> 50:35.264
Drink water,
drink fucking water...

50:35.266 --> 50:37.133
Fucking penicillin
in that water.

50:53.050 --> 50:54.316
I'm alive.

50:57.388 --> 50:59.588
You okay?
Let's get you to bed.

50:59.590 --> 51:02.091
Oh!
Can you do it horizontally?

51:03.493 --> 51:05.394
Yeah. Yeah.

51:05.396 --> 51:06.662
Thank you.

51:11.234 --> 51:13.069
You know who
doesn't have a pulse?

51:13.071 --> 51:14.136
Who?

51:14.138 --> 51:15.638
Shamus.

51:16.740 --> 51:20.276
And he's vampire because
you have to invite him in.

51:20.278 --> 51:22.378
Inside. For him to come in.

51:22.380 --> 51:23.712
Did you invite him in?

51:23.714 --> 51:27.016
Yeah, but it's
opposite day for vampires.

51:27.018 --> 51:28.284
Oh...

51:58.782 --> 52:00.149
Best...

52:06.523 --> 52:07.656
Friend.

52:36.052 --> 52:37.386
Oh...

52:37.388 --> 52:40.055
Sorry. I'm still here.

52:40.057 --> 52:42.091
I mean, I'm not sorry
I'm still here.

52:42.093 --> 52:43.792
I'm glad, uh...

52:43.794 --> 52:44.860
But... yeah.

52:46.196 --> 52:47.663
How are you feeling?

52:49.065 --> 52:51.200
Less than fresh.

52:52.035 --> 52:53.769
Sorry I fell asleep last night.

52:53.771 --> 52:54.837
That's okay.

52:56.407 --> 52:57.606
I really wanted to, uh...

52:57.608 --> 53:00.543
You know,
it's probably for the best.

53:00.545 --> 53:01.610
Really.

53:11.054 --> 53:13.489
Okay. Well...

53:13.491 --> 53:15.925
Uh... I'll see you around.

53:16.393 --> 53:17.626
Yup.

53:26.036 --> 53:28.070
Hey! All right!

53:28.072 --> 53:29.738
No, no, no. We didn't, uh...

53:29.740 --> 53:32.341
Bro code. I get it.

54:09.212 --> 54:10.346
Call me Faye.

54:10.348 --> 54:12.314
And thank you...

54:12.849 --> 54:14.350
For this opportunity.

54:14.352 --> 54:17.119
A position at
east cliff academy is...

54:17.121 --> 54:19.655
The opportunity of a lifetime.

54:20.824 --> 54:24.493
You have... no idea how much
this opportunity means to me.

54:24.495 --> 54:26.996
Yes, you do, I guess I
just have to deal with it.

54:37.474 --> 54:39.541
- Dina?
- -Hi, hon.

54:41.011 --> 54:42.845
I'm making eggplant parm.

54:44.881 --> 54:45.948
Hi!

54:47.684 --> 54:48.550
Is Ronnie awake?

54:48.552 --> 54:50.686
She ate the donut
that I brought her

54:50.688 --> 54:52.988
and said she had plans
and took off.

54:54.224 --> 54:55.491
She seems...

54:56.393 --> 54:57.660
The same.

55:04.267 --> 55:06.168
How's Roger?

55:06.170 --> 55:08.404
He joined a gym.

55:08.406 --> 55:11.140
I wasn't sure how this
would be for him, but...

55:11.142 --> 55:12.975
That's a step, a big one.

55:13.977 --> 55:16.045
Ronnie could use some exercise.

55:19.249 --> 55:21.083
I'm sorry. I'm trying.

55:22.152 --> 55:25.587
Oh, Faye, it's not your fault.

55:25.589 --> 55:28.123
You know, Roger and I
asked you to help with her,

55:28.125 --> 55:29.625
but if it's too hard...

55:29.627 --> 55:31.894
Wha-- what do you mean,
"too hard"?

55:32.896 --> 55:35.130
Just that everything
with Garrett was a lot,

55:35.132 --> 55:36.198
especially for you.

55:36.200 --> 55:37.399
I am not fragile.

55:37.401 --> 55:39.201
I never said you were fragile.

55:39.203 --> 55:41.670
I can handle things, okay?

55:42.405 --> 55:44.907
I wanted to be there for Garrett

55:44.909 --> 55:47.943
and he sent me away, okay?

55:48.611 --> 55:49.912
Okay.

55:56.419 --> 55:57.720
How long are you staying?

55:59.322 --> 56:00.989
I have work in the morning.

56:03.693 --> 56:05.527
You might wanna beat traffic.

56:10.567 --> 56:13.502
I finally got to cleaning out
Garrett's room.

56:14.904 --> 56:16.004
Found these.

56:17.006 --> 56:19.375
That's why I'm here.

56:19.377 --> 56:22.678
Ronnie booked it so fast, I
didn't have a chance to tell her.

56:24.414 --> 56:26.081
There's one for each of you.

56:28.084 --> 56:29.485
From Garrett.

56:35.358 --> 56:37.426
Roger and I thought that...

56:38.061 --> 56:40.028
You two could use a guardian.

56:46.336 --> 56:47.870
Garrett loved it here.

57:06.523 --> 57:07.790
What's this?

57:09.058 --> 57:10.192
Dandelion root tea.

57:11.094 --> 57:12.428
Ugh!

57:14.531 --> 57:17.032
Can we turn it into hot toddies?

57:22.138 --> 57:23.739
How are you doing?

57:26.409 --> 57:27.743
How come?

57:27.745 --> 57:29.111
I mean, I know the obvious,

57:29.113 --> 57:31.680
but do you know specifically
what's the worst part?

57:33.650 --> 57:34.716
Mmm...

57:36.386 --> 57:37.820
He's not here.

57:40.023 --> 57:41.089
Yeah.

57:42.058 --> 57:43.125
He's not here.

57:52.502 --> 57:54.570
When was the last time
you had a massage?

57:56.940 --> 57:58.474
I don't know.

57:58.476 --> 58:00.809
I think you have
stagnant energy.

58:01.144 --> 58:02.211
Ugh!

58:03.847 --> 58:05.581
Lie down.

58:05.583 --> 58:07.816
Don't flatter yourself.

59:08.811 --> 59:10.913
Did you ever massage Garrett?

59:13.082 --> 59:14.149
Yeah.

59:15.985 --> 59:17.052
Good.

59:17.587 --> 59:19.221
He was so uptight.

59:21.658 --> 59:23.859
"Don't do that."
"Don't say that."

59:23.861 --> 59:26.028
"Don't wear that
in public, Ronnie."

59:31.634 --> 59:33.969
One time he caught me
and our tennis coach

59:33.971 --> 59:35.170
in the ball room.

59:35.172 --> 59:37.706
We were just making out,
but he came in and...

59:37.708 --> 59:39.474
Kneed him in the groin, and then

59:39.476 --> 59:41.310
hoisted me over his shoulder and

59:41.312 --> 59:42.878
carried me all the way home.

59:45.516 --> 59:47.916
Probably could have
gotten free, but I didn't.

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:15.777
Why?

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:18.347
Because of Garrett?
He's not here. He's dead.

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:22.250
You don't have to be dead
to be not here.

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:33.381
Hey.

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:36.985
Mmm.

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:49.531
No, that's all right.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:51.333
It's okay.

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:24.466
Wait-- wait.

01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:25.534
What--

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:00.535
Faye, you all right?

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:04.239
Yeah...

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:12.113
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, um...

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:14.616
Uh-huh.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.855
You know, we don't
have to do this.

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:28.763
Sh...

01:04:28.765 --> 01:04:32.100
She-- stood still...

01:04:32.102 --> 01:04:33.301
And he--

01:04:35.938 --> 01:04:38.006
He spun around...

01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:41.910
He took a spill and--

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:45.847
--she--

01:04:45.849 --> 01:04:48.350
Fell down.

01:04:48.352 --> 01:04:49.885
She stood--

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:54.456
Still,
and he spun around--

01:04:54.458 --> 01:04:56.625
She took a spill...

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.661
And he fell down.

01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:01.062
Sh--

01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:07.102
They stayed apart,
they wouldn't dare

01:05:07.104 --> 01:05:09.371
admit they were
the perfect pair.

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:26.381
Hey?

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:30.485
Did you wanna come back to bed?

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:03.118
You know the raven twist rhymes?

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:06.187
Mm-hmm.

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:08.790
My mom used to read them
to me when I had bad dreams.

01:07:13.462 --> 01:07:15.163
You share so easily.

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:19.801
Nothing embarrassing
about comfort.

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:28.376
Did you know
Ronnie's brother died?

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:32.247
Garrett, yeah.

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:34.516
Yeah, I met him a few times.

01:07:38.154 --> 01:07:39.788
He was my boyfriend.

01:07:42.059 --> 01:07:44.292
Ex-boyfriend.

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:47.228
He broke up with me a year ago.

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:52.267
When he found out he was sick?

01:07:55.972 --> 01:07:57.639
When he found out he was dying.

01:08:02.845 --> 01:08:04.979
Their mom...

01:08:04.981 --> 01:08:08.083
Died of cancer
when they were little and...

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:11.219
Garrett...

01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:14.355
Remembered watching it
destroy their dad.

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:16.591
So...

01:08:17.725 --> 01:08:19.794
He didn't want me to see it.

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:22.330
His dying.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:27.167
Or at least that's what
he told me.

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:29.270
Like I couldn't
handle it or something.

01:08:35.711 --> 01:08:36.845
Could you?

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:45.185
I went on my first date

01:08:45.188 --> 01:08:47.388
in a year on April fool's day.

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:52.493
This guy from
my psychology class.

01:08:53.595 --> 01:08:55.830
Billy. Billy Dejario.

01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:03.171
Yeah, he told me my hair
was like sunshine, so...

01:09:03.173 --> 01:09:05.874
I got a Margarita with him.

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:12.447
It was going well.

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:16.518
You know? It was going
surprisingly well.

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:19.854
And at a certain point he...

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:22.457
Got up, I think,

01:09:22.459 --> 01:09:25.326
to get a second round
or something, and...

01:09:27.462 --> 01:09:29.330
I...

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:32.233
Noticed that I'd missed
a call from Garrett.

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:39.374
Fuck!

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:40.908
Fuck!

01:09:42.978 --> 01:09:44.578
A year of nothing...

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:49.384
No contact. Crickets.
And then...

01:09:49.386 --> 01:09:52.220
I'm on my first fucking date

01:09:52.955 --> 01:09:54.656
and now you call?

01:09:54.658 --> 01:09:56.191
What? To--

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:58.593
Like...

01:09:58.595 --> 01:10:02.230
Summon me? What for? What?
So you can...

01:10:02.232 --> 01:10:03.865
It's, uh...

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.833
Say goodbye?

01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:08.570
"I'm sorry"?

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:12.941
No.

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:21.082
I already said goodbye, and...

01:10:21.084 --> 01:10:23.851
Your apology is nothing.

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:28.256
Now you know how it feels.

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:31.793
The silence.

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:38.233
And I never called him back.

01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:44.372
He died three days later.

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:54.382
Talk about "the silence,"
you know?

01:10:54.384 --> 01:10:57.418
And I guess that's something
that I have to live with.

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:00.555
And...

01:11:01.724 --> 01:11:04.659
You know,
the lesson is like, always

01:11:04.661 --> 01:11:08.196
tell your loved ones you love
them when you have the chance.

01:11:08.198 --> 01:11:10.498
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.267
But...

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:16.337
I gotta say...

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:19.240
I'm living with it, and...

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:26.347
It makes me really happy

01:11:26.349 --> 01:11:28.082
to know that one
of the last things he did

01:11:28.084 --> 01:11:29.884
was call me and I didn't answer.

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:27.608
Faye!

01:12:28.878 --> 01:12:29.744
Got any snacks?

01:12:29.746 --> 01:12:31.512
--Mmm...

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:33.081
Faye, are you home?

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:34.349
You giving me
the silent treatment

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:36.918
because I shirked
your fun schedule?

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.720
Ah!

01:12:42.257 --> 01:12:43.491
Hi, guys.

01:12:43.493 --> 01:12:46.127
Hey, what did Dina bring us?
We're so hungry.

01:12:46.129 --> 01:12:47.662
Eggplant Parmesan.

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:49.063
Ugh!

01:12:56.406 --> 01:12:58.005
Where have you been?

01:12:58.007 --> 01:12:59.640
Oh, I ran into these guys.

01:12:59.642 --> 01:13:01.642
Yeah, we, uh, bought a 24-pack,

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:03.845
finished it in 48 minutes.

01:13:03.847 --> 01:13:05.513
Fucking destroyed!

01:13:05.515 --> 01:13:09.417
Yeah, and then I invited people
for the Canada day party.

01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:11.853
--People?

01:13:11.855 --> 01:13:15.123
All the people in all the land.

01:13:15.125 --> 01:13:17.158
Yo, why isn't it working?

01:13:20.864 --> 01:13:22.397
Batman.

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:24.799
Hey, do you want some lemonade?

01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:28.603
Shamus made it.
It's really fresh.

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:30.171
Yeah, sure.

01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:41.582
Mmm.

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:48.823
What?

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:52.226
Does anything
taste a little bit...

01:13:52.228 --> 01:13:53.861
Odd about that lemonade?

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:56.898
Maybe, like...

01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.166
Something special.

01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:01.469
What is it?

01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:07.742
Ronnie, what is in this?

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:10.711
Weed?

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:13.815
- Mdma.

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:19.854
Ronnie, I have my Skype
interview in half an hour.

01:14:19.856 --> 01:14:21.756
- Oh, shit!

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:24.959
Why would you do that?

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:28.429
Well, uh, I didn't know that
your Skype interview was today.

01:14:28.431 --> 01:14:30.097
Well, when in doubt,

01:14:30.099 --> 01:14:32.066
don't fucking drug me!

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.140
Faye!

01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:40.875
Faye, maybe we could help.

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:50.985
Hi, Faye.

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:52.320
I'm Sarah Martin.

01:14:52.322 --> 01:14:54.522
I'm Dean of edge cliff academy.

01:14:54.524 --> 01:14:55.590
Nice to meet you.

01:14:55.592 --> 01:14:57.825
Nice to meet you, Dean Martin.

01:15:08.904 --> 01:15:11.372
Is that-- is that
what you go by? Dean Martin?

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.609
Faye?

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:22.884
Excuse me? Faye?

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:26.754
Uh... okay...
We're just gonna...

01:15:26.756 --> 01:15:29.023
Um, tell them
it was bad service.

01:15:29.025 --> 01:15:32.293
We can't just tell them
it was bad service.

01:15:32.295 --> 01:15:35.263
Th-Th-they're not idiots.

01:15:35.265 --> 01:15:37.298
It's-it's-it's gonna be fine.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:40.034
No! It's not gonna be fine.

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:40.902
Do you really think that?

01:15:40.904 --> 01:15:42.370
Or do you just always play dumb?

01:15:42.372 --> 01:15:45.373
Because not all
of us are content

01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:47.675
living at home and mowing lawns.

01:15:47.677 --> 01:15:49.410
Some of us are going places.

01:15:49.412 --> 01:15:53.381
And I'm going places.
I need to go places.

01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:56.717
I-- I needed that job, Ronnie.

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:04.792
Phew!

01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:06.827
Fuck!

01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:27.308
Absolutely.

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:29.977
Okay.

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:33.881
I completely understand.
Thank you.

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:37.051
Thank you. Yeah.

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:39.420
Great. Have a--

01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:46.994
What'd they say?

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:49.897
If I go to Vancouver, they might
give me another chance, but...

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:52.133
No promises.

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:56.203
That's great.
That's really great.

01:17:57.539 --> 01:17:59.440
I'm gonna take
the first bus back.

01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:05.112
Bus doesn't run on weekends.

01:18:06.548 --> 01:18:07.815
So Monday then.

01:18:19.594 --> 01:18:20.861
Faye?

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:28.796
Don't eat the party snacks.

01:19:28.798 --> 01:19:30.297
I'm not.

01:19:38.673 --> 01:19:40.141
Damn it!

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:27.087
Is that Dale?

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:30.157
Why is Dale here?

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:31.959
I don't know.
I didn't invite him.

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:34.395
Who just shows up uninvited?

01:20:34.397 --> 01:20:36.964
Yo, red. You got a hose?

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:41.135
What is the raft for?

01:20:44.807 --> 01:20:46.307
There you go.

01:20:46.309 --> 01:20:48.876
Grab her hair for leverage.
Grab her hair for leverage.

01:20:48.878 --> 01:20:51.745
There you go!
That's what Dale taught you.

01:20:51.747 --> 01:20:53.280
Gotta roll her over.

01:20:53.282 --> 01:20:56.083
Get her in the deep end. Get her
down in the ground down there.

01:20:56.085 --> 01:20:57.318
Bring 'em out.

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.321
Okay. It's food.
It's made out of eggs.

01:21:00.323 --> 01:21:01.388
Scrambled eggs.

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:01.388
No...

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:04.124
It's like, uh,
you bake it in the oven.

01:21:04.126 --> 01:21:07.094
Uh... it's like a frittata
but with crust.

01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:08.863
Uh, there's a little bit of ham,

01:21:08.865 --> 01:21:12.066
some spinach, and nice feta.
Come on.

01:21:12.068 --> 01:21:13.601
- Time's up.

01:21:13.603 --> 01:21:15.035
I must pee.

01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:18.505
It was quiche. Quiche!

01:21:18.507 --> 01:21:20.641
Quiche? What's quiche?

01:21:20.643 --> 01:21:22.409
Is that like a breakfast pie?

01:21:24.513 --> 01:21:26.213
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:27.948
You wanna flip that one?

01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:30.084
There's another 57 seconds left.

01:21:30.086 --> 01:21:32.453
- Oh, timer, okay.

01:21:33.088 --> 01:21:34.622
I think it's burnt.

01:21:36.524 --> 01:21:38.125
Oh...

01:21:38.127 --> 01:21:39.760
Damn it!
How'd you know that?

01:21:39.762 --> 01:21:42.029
Because I'm a man.

01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:43.831
Sometimes I feel like I need
to remind people of that.

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:50.437
My lady.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:55.142
Lookin' pretty good
in that hat. It's hot.

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:57.845
This hat.

01:21:57.847 --> 01:21:59.647
Any hat.

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:11.125
I nailed it!

01:22:17.465 --> 01:22:18.933
Hey.

01:22:21.836 --> 01:22:24.972
Sorry, I came in
to use the bathroom.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.107
It's right there.

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:29.410
I know.

01:22:38.186 --> 01:22:40.988
How did you
meet Garrett... again?

01:22:42.023 --> 01:22:45.292
He was a candy monster.
Just like you.

01:22:48.263 --> 01:22:49.396
I know.

01:22:55.303 --> 01:22:56.603
We had a thing.

01:22:58.206 --> 01:22:59.373
A thing?

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:02.109
Nothing serious.

01:23:02.877 --> 01:23:04.144
You're crying.

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:13.253
Do you know who I was to him?

01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:20.594
I don't think I do.

01:23:24.733 --> 01:23:27.067
I can't...

01:23:27.069 --> 01:23:29.169
I can't imagine
how you're feeling right now.

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:30.704
Kind of looks like you can.

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:32.573
No...

01:23:33.975 --> 01:23:35.542
That's all yours.

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:52.893
Hola, senorita.

01:23:52.895 --> 01:23:54.428
I'm making you margs...

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:58.699
Whoa, you're fast.

01:23:58.701 --> 01:24:02.636
Okay, it's kind of gross,
but I like where you're going.

01:24:02.638 --> 01:24:04.571
Hey, hey, what's the matter?
What's the matter?

01:24:04.573 --> 01:24:06.073
Fuck off!

01:24:06.075 --> 01:24:07.875
Fuck you!

01:24:07.877 --> 01:24:10.144
One of Garrett's random friends?

01:24:10.612 --> 01:24:11.812
Random friend.

01:24:11.814 --> 01:24:13.313
Alex is not random, Ronnie.

01:24:13.315 --> 01:24:15.549
She's fucking grieving.

01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:17.217
- I know. I know.
- Yeah.

01:24:17.219 --> 01:24:20.988
I know you know. That's why
you were being so weird.

01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:23.357
Well, Faye, he asked me
not to tell you.

01:24:23.359 --> 01:24:24.892
So, what was I supposed to do?

01:24:24.894 --> 01:24:26.360
Just throw him under the bus?

01:24:26.362 --> 01:24:28.862
Didn't you think that
that might help me?

01:24:28.864 --> 01:24:30.931
That it might help me
to know that.

01:24:30.933 --> 01:24:33.233
No, no, of course
you didn't because...

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:34.368
You don't think
about other people.

01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:36.070
We all bend over
backwards to help you,

01:24:36.072 --> 01:24:39.540
but it would never cross
your mind to help any of us.

01:24:39.542 --> 01:24:43.644
Oh... oh! I don't ask anybody
to help me, okay?

01:24:43.646 --> 01:24:43.644
I don't need your help.

01:24:43.646 --> 01:24:47.948
Yeah, well, that's great
because you'd be on top.

01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:50.217
Oh! Okay.

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:16.977
Whoa, whoa... you okay?
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:25:16.979 --> 01:25:18.812
Don't touch me!

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:37.464
- Hey!
- Like old times.

01:25:37.466 --> 01:25:39.867
Uh... what's different
from an hour ago?

01:25:41.537 --> 01:25:44.371
I don't want to, and you don't
even know what you're doing, okay?

01:25:44.373 --> 01:25:46.840
Oh, I-- I know what I'm doing.

01:25:46.842 --> 01:25:47.774
You don't, okay?

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:55.582
Screw you, Shamu!

01:25:55.584 --> 01:25:57.284
- Ow!
- -Oh, shit!

01:25:57.286 --> 01:25:58.819
- Are you okay?
- -Fuck!

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:16.770
Whoa! Occupied.

01:26:24.345 --> 01:26:26.180
- You okay?
- -Don't.

01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:27.681
Pardon?

01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:28.815
Don't zip it up.

01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:30.817
Are you concuss--

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:36.223
Jesus!

01:26:36.225 --> 01:26:38.392
Ah!

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:48.702
Fuck it.

01:27:04.919 --> 01:27:06.220
Damn it...

01:27:06.222 --> 01:27:08.589
Okay, I got it, I got it...

01:27:08.591 --> 01:27:10.324
Okay, okay. Wait, wait,
Ronnie, Ronnie...

01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:13.327
Ronnie, I just don't think
it's gonna happen, okay?

01:27:13.329 --> 01:27:16.396
What? You got
like penile dysfunction?

01:27:16.398 --> 01:27:19.700
No. It's just not fucking
indestructible either.

01:27:43.292 --> 01:27:45.692
- You and me, me and her.

01:27:45.694 --> 01:27:45.692
Me and her.

01:27:45.694 --> 01:27:49.229
The bathroom
is for bathroom activities.

01:27:49.231 --> 01:27:51.365
--Is that you, red?

01:27:51.367 --> 01:27:53.200
There's always room
for one more.

01:27:54.637 --> 01:27:56.803
--Please...

01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:05.145
Fantastic.

01:28:05.147 --> 01:28:07.781
Faye, this is not
exactly what it looks like.

01:28:10.084 --> 01:28:11.818
Ronnie...

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:13.453
This is for me from Garrett.

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:15.956
Who opened this?

01:28:16.658 --> 01:28:17.724
Did you open it?

01:28:17.726 --> 01:28:17.724
I can explain.

01:28:17.726 --> 01:28:21.228
You can explain that Garrett
left me a fucking letter

01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:22.896
and you opened it?

01:28:22.898 --> 01:28:24.031
Yes.

01:28:24.033 --> 01:28:25.299
Okay.

01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:37.077
Ronnie, wait.

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:41.148
How could you
do something like that?

01:28:41.150 --> 01:28:42.516
I didn't think
you could handle it.

01:28:42.518 --> 01:28:44.251
Oh, my god, you have no idea

01:28:44.253 --> 01:28:45.886
- what I can fucking handle.
- I'm sorry!

01:28:45.888 --> 01:28:46.987
I earned that letter.

01:28:46.989 --> 01:28:48.055
I know!

01:28:48.057 --> 01:28:49.656
You were a fucking tourist!

01:28:49.658 --> 01:28:52.292
So, tell me!
Tell me what I missed.

01:28:52.294 --> 01:28:54.294
That is all I want.

01:28:54.296 --> 01:28:56.363
How do you
remember him, Faye, huh?

01:28:56.365 --> 01:28:57.964
How do you remember him?

01:28:57.966 --> 01:29:00.300
Do you remember him fucking
picking you up from the beach

01:29:00.302 --> 01:29:01.768
when you busted your knee?

01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:03.203
Do you remember him,
I don't know,

01:29:03.205 --> 01:29:04.571
asking you out to homecoming?

01:29:04.573 --> 01:29:08.241
Do you remember him
taking your fucking virginity?

01:29:08.243 --> 01:29:12.012
Good for you, Faye,
those are pretty pictures.

01:29:12.014 --> 01:29:15.215
Me, oh, gosh, I remember...

01:29:15.217 --> 01:29:17.651
Collar bones, and, and...

01:29:17.653 --> 01:29:20.153
The sound of him
crying at night, and...

01:29:20.155 --> 01:29:23.090
And mixing bowls
full of vomit and...

01:29:23.092 --> 01:29:26.093
And, and how
he took up prayer, okay?

01:29:26.095 --> 01:29:27.994
He kicked you out
for a reason, Faye.

01:29:27.996 --> 01:29:30.130
And I do not pity you.

01:29:30.132 --> 01:29:31.832
I am so fucking jealous of you.

01:29:31.834 --> 01:29:34.134
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

01:29:34.136 --> 01:29:35.936
Okay. I should be
ashamed of myself?

01:29:35.938 --> 01:29:38.705
Jesus fucking Christ.
Quit your pity party.

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:40.273
You had the chance
to talk to him.

01:29:40.275 --> 01:29:41.875
And you didn't pick up.

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:45.145
What?

01:29:45.747 --> 01:29:47.314
Yeah, I know.

01:29:47.316 --> 01:29:48.615
And you know what else I know?

01:29:49.183 --> 01:29:50.717
He didn't call you.

01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:56.056
- What?
- Yeah.

01:29:56.058 --> 01:29:57.457
I called you.

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.594
Why would you do that?

01:30:00.995 --> 01:30:02.062
Because...

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:04.564
I thought that you would come.

01:30:05.833 --> 01:30:08.168
I, like, really needed
you to come.

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:11.538
But, guess Garrett was right.

01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:14.007
You couldn't handle it.
And he knew that.

01:30:14.009 --> 01:30:17.444
Even at the end.
He didn't want you there!

01:31:00.189 --> 01:31:01.254
Should we stop them?

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:05.659
I think they need this.

01:31:15.704 --> 01:31:17.604
--Ooh!

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:38.852
Yo, what do you wanna watch?

01:32:39.854 --> 01:32:40.921
Twins?

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:44.257
Twins.

01:32:48.996 --> 01:32:50.497
Hey, Ronnie?

01:32:50.499 --> 01:32:51.865
Mm-hmm.

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:58.738
I couldn't open mine, so...

01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:00.740
That's why I opened yours.

01:33:14.722 --> 01:33:15.989
What's it say?

01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:19.826
Ugh!

01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:24.664
What a shithead!

01:33:25.466 --> 01:33:26.666
It's the same.

01:33:26.668 --> 01:33:29.002
Yeah, our names are different.

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:33.006
Do you think...

01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:36.710
That these are the only words
he knew how to spell?

01:33:36.712 --> 01:33:38.345
Probably.

01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:43.216
"Anything you wanna say
before you die, Garrett?"

01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:45.819
"You know what?

01:33:45.821 --> 01:33:47.554
Let's just make it
a group text."

01:33:50.558 --> 01:33:52.525
Yeah...

01:33:52.527 --> 01:33:54.728
He wasn't really a wordy guy.

01:33:56.731 --> 01:33:58.632
Guess nobody's perfect.

01:33:59.066 --> 01:34:00.300
Yeah.

01:34:00.302 --> 01:34:02.102
Not even close.

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:05.372
He like...

01:34:05.374 --> 01:34:09.743
Could never really understand
people with accents.

01:34:12.413 --> 01:34:14.481
Yeah, he was
a really bad tipper.

01:34:14.483 --> 01:34:17.317
Oh, yeah. Low, low.

01:34:17.319 --> 01:34:18.952
Embarrassingly bad.

01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:22.022
He wasn't nice to old people.

01:34:22.024 --> 01:34:23.089
Nope.

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:24.424
Mm-mmm.

01:34:25.426 --> 01:34:27.460
He would never dance with me.

01:34:27.462 --> 01:34:29.162
It's a crime.

01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:31.831
He was ridiculous.

01:34:31.833 --> 01:34:33.867
Sometimes he would come
into my room just to fart.

01:34:33.869 --> 01:34:36.136
- Yes.

01:34:36.138 --> 01:34:37.203
You do, too.

01:34:37.205 --> 01:34:38.872
Ew! I do not.

01:34:38.874 --> 01:34:40.640
Something you have in common.

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:47.947
Every holiday, I got a gift
certificate from AutoZone.

01:34:47.949 --> 01:34:50.050
Me too.

01:34:50.052 --> 01:34:52.018
- What a jerk!

01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:54.220
Man!

01:34:56.792 --> 01:34:59.392
One time he hit a cat
and kept driving.

01:35:01.996 --> 01:35:03.096
Oh, my god.

01:35:04.999 --> 01:35:07.867
Yeah, that one's dark.
I'll keep it to myself.

01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:09.803
Yeah.

01:35:09.805 --> 01:35:12.706
Oh, he breast fed until he
was about four years old.

01:35:13.407 --> 01:35:14.574
- What?
- Yup!

01:35:14.576 --> 01:35:16.376
He only stopped
because I popped up.

01:35:17.978 --> 01:35:19.145
Ew!

01:35:24.618 --> 01:35:26.119
He cut me out of his life.

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:30.090
Yeah.

01:35:30.725 --> 01:35:32.759
Well, he cut you out of mine.

01:35:38.332 --> 01:35:39.399
Twins?

01:35:40.535 --> 01:35:42.035
Do I have a choice?

01:35:42.037 --> 01:35:43.103
Nope.

01:35:50.544 --> 01:35:52.011
Mmm...

01:35:56.117 --> 01:35:57.283
Thank you.

01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:46.266
Garrett.

01:36:48.235 --> 01:36:49.736
A portion of Garrett.

01:36:49.738 --> 01:36:52.405
That's not all of him. The rest
of him is back in Calgary.

01:36:53.707 --> 01:36:57.076
Dina scooped out part of his
ashes and put it in this jar?

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.514
Like a snack.

01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:05.218
These are her pickling jars.

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:08.421
I didn't really think about it.

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:14.928
Portion of Garrett.

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:30.143
You sure about this?

01:37:39.353 --> 01:37:41.254
Well, that's one way to do it.

01:38:11.418 --> 01:38:13.019
Ronnie!

01:38:13.021 --> 01:38:15.388
I'm back! Let's hit it.

01:38:19.593 --> 01:38:20.994
Granville brought it.

01:38:22.763 --> 01:38:24.330
What is it? Uranus?

01:38:25.232 --> 01:38:27.133
It's a quasi-stellar object.

01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:04.370
Hey, Garrett.

01:39:08.275 --> 01:39:11.377
I know I'm not
supposed to sit here, but...

01:39:14.715 --> 01:39:16.349
The way I see it,
if you're really up there,

01:39:16.351 --> 01:39:19.118
you can just make sure that
I don't crash and kill us.

01:39:20.722 --> 01:39:22.121
This totally works, right?

01:39:26.694 --> 01:39:29.329
And if you're not...

01:39:32.166 --> 01:39:36.269
Well, you're not the boss
of me, you butt-face.

01:39:38.939 --> 01:39:40.606
I can take care of myself.
