00:10.553 --> 00:13.055
-That's sold.
-It is? We just got here.

00:13.097 --> 00:14.724
Most of the pieces here
are already sold.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.142
Isn't this the opening?

00:16.183 --> 00:18.227
They invite serious collectors
to come to the pre-opening.

00:18.269 --> 00:20.229
-I bought those three last week.
-How much?

00:20.271 --> 00:21.439
-For this one?
-Yeah.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.732
-$1,200.
-You're kidding.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.400
I got to get Ethan a paint set.

00:24.442 --> 00:26.861
Oh, Parsons. Ha! It's Parsons.
That's Parsons.

00:26.902 --> 00:29.947
I have to go talk to him.

00:29.989 --> 00:31.991

00:37.121 --> 00:38.706
Hungry. I thought
there'd be snacks.

00:38.748 --> 00:41.584
-You just seemed very immersed.
-In what?

00:41.625 --> 00:43.461
Oh. This, yes. Very.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.504
He paints completely naked.

00:45.546 --> 00:49.717
Well, oil-based paint is really
hard to get out of most fabrics.

00:49.759 --> 00:51.927
Seriously, how do you respond
to, "He paints naked"?

00:51.969 --> 00:53.971
I'm just asking.

00:54.013 --> 00:55.723
-How was Parsons?
-Very angry.

00:55.765 --> 00:57.641
I bought those paintings
right out from under him.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.393
-And this makes you happy?
-Extremely.

00:59.435 --> 01:01.103
He stole a Rauschenberg
from me last month.

01:01.145 --> 01:03.189
Bastard waited till
I was ordering a drink.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.024
Bam. Flew in, cash on the table.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.026
Plus, the bartender
got my drink wrong.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.862
So how are you? Good? Yes?
Having fun? It's fun, right?

01:09.904 --> 01:12.448
Little question: Have you been
popping mama's diet pills?

01:12.490 --> 01:14.950
I get a little excited when
it comes to art and revenge.

01:14.992 --> 01:17.119
-Sure.
-This is a particularly
great show.

01:17.161 --> 01:18.996
Solomon Crespi has been around
for a few years,

01:19.038 --> 01:20.664
but this show, this could be
his breakthrough.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.958
And I got three of his paintings
and Parsons got none.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.835
-Ah! David Mellman. David!
-Do you hate him, too?

01:24.877 --> 01:25.961
Should we take him out?

01:26.003 --> 01:27.880
You buy his art while
I go fuck up his drink?

01:27.922 --> 01:30.174
-Where the hell
have you been all my life?
-Riverside Drive and 113th.

01:30.216 --> 01:32.676
-I just needed to take
a walk in the park.
-Live and learn.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.553
You are a great date
to bring to something

01:34.595 --> 01:36.430
you know nothing about
and have no interest in.

01:36.472 --> 01:38.307
Wait till you see me
at a boxing match.

01:38.349 --> 01:39.558
I'm gonna get you another drink.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.726
You're going to gloat.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.394
But I'm going to gloat
by the bar,

01:42.436 --> 01:44.647

-Martini, two olives.

01:44.688 --> 01:47.066
-Cold, it's cold.
-It's the coldness I crave.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.734
The coldness is brilliant.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.654
It's the coldness that gets you

08:43.440 --> 08:45.400
He's considered one of
the greats by his peers,

08:45.442 --> 08:46.818
but he can't sell his art.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.528
Well, won't sell his art,
actually.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.822
-Why?
-He's crazy. Just won't do it.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.908
And if someone ever does
talk him into a sale,

08:52.950 --> 08:54.952
he always finds a way
to get out of it.

08:54.993 --> 08:57.037
Early in his career,
he made a very big sale.

08:57.079 --> 08:59.581
Peggy Guggenheim.
The day she came to pick it up,

08:59.623 --> 09:02.000
he sets it on fire
right in front of her,

09:02.042 --> 09:04.336
and then puts the fire out by...

09:04.378 --> 09:06.255
Well, let's just say he did not
use a fire extinguisher.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.382
That's not true.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.883
DECLAN:
The last thing I read

09:09.925 --> 09:14.554
that made any sense to me
at all: Peanuts.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.181
There's a story,
urban myth maybe,

09:16.223 --> 09:17.516
about a painting he painted.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.976
It was supposed to be
a masterpiece,

09:19.017 --> 09:21.270
a thing of such beauty that,
when Jackson Pollock saw it,

09:21.311 --> 09:23.563
he said he wasn't sure
if he would ever paint again.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.232
Nothing he could do
could come close.

09:25.274 --> 09:28.193
-Really? Have you seen it?
-No one's seen it but Pollock.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.070
A lot of people think
it doesn't exist.

09:30.112 --> 09:31.321
Wow, Declan Howell.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.448
That's like spotting a unicorn
at the automat.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.658
DECLAN:
Bollocks.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.910
Can I have another drink?

09:36.952 --> 09:39.079
Hello?

09:39.121 --> 09:42.666
-Are you ignoring me?
-Yes, I am ignoring you.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.543
Well, that doesn't
seem very nice.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.169
You told me to cut you off
after six.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.672
-Six what?
-Six drinks.

09:48.714 --> 09:50.590
Oh, well, that doesn't
sound like me.

09:50.632 --> 09:51.800
Uh, give us another.

09:51.842 --> 09:53.593
Declan, you're drunk.

09:53.635 --> 09:57.139
Listen to me,
you dime-store Fagin.

09:57.180 --> 10:00.392
I know when I'm drunk
and when I'm not drunk,

10:00.434 --> 10:02.477
and I'm not drunk.

10:03.562 --> 10:06.315
Where are you going?
Where's he going?

10:06.356 --> 10:07.858
WOMAN:
Everybody, shh.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.027
-Where are you going?
-You're doing it again.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.821
Oh, dear, elevation's
never been his friend.

10:12.863 --> 10:16.575
-I will now prove
-(music stops, people shushing)

10:16.616 --> 10:19.328
to everyone in attendance

10:19.369 --> 10:24.207
my complete lack of inebriation.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.417
(laughter)

10:25.459 --> 10:28.420
You all love the Bard so much.

10:28.462 --> 10:32.632
Therefore, I shall
recite for you a sonnet.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.134
(excited chatter, whistling)

10:34.176 --> 10:36.887
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

10:36.928 --> 10:40.349
-(cheering)
-"Thou art more lovely

10:40.390 --> 10:42.601
"and more temperate.

10:42.642 --> 10:47.105
"Rough winds do shake, um,
the darling buds of May.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.982
And summer's lease..."

10:49.024 --> 10:53.320
-"Let me not to the marriage
of true minds
-(laughter)

10:53.362 --> 10:55.155
"admit impediments.

10:55.197 --> 10:58.700
Love is not love..."

10:58.742 --> 11:00.369
That's not the right words,
is it?

11:00.410 --> 11:01.411
-Shut up.
-(laughter)

11:01.453 --> 11:05.040
"Which alters when it
alteration finds,

11:05.082 --> 11:08.001
or bends with..."

11:08.043 --> 11:10.587
-"She walks in beauty,
like the night."
-(laughter)

11:10.629 --> 11:12.881
-That's Byron.
-Same fucking thing.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.633
-(laughter)
-"Of cloudless climes

11:14.674 --> 11:17.469
and starless... fucking skies."

11:17.511 --> 11:20.013
William Blake,
Auguries of Innocence.

11:20.055 --> 11:23.433
"To see a world
in a grain of sand

11:23.475 --> 11:27.062
"and a Heaven in a wild flower

11:27.104 --> 11:30.273
"to hold infinity
in the palm of your..."

11:30.315 --> 11:32.192
-(claps)
-Harlot's House!
-(cheering)

11:32.234 --> 11:34.653
-Finish one, for fuck's sake.
-"'Twas brillig,

11:34.694 --> 11:37.989
-and the slithy toves..."
-(laughter)

11:38.031 --> 11:40.826
"...did gyre and gimble
in the wabe.

11:40.867 --> 11:41.993
-"All...
-MAN: Mimsy!

11:42.035 --> 11:44.287
"...mimsy were the borogoves,

11:44.329 --> 11:47.416
-"And it was a spring day!"
-(cheering, laughter)

11:47.457 --> 11:49.793
"It was a day for a lay

11:49.835 --> 11:53.672
and the air smelled
like a locker room..."

11:53.713 --> 11:56.133
"Hickory, dickory, dock,
the mouse ran up the clock.

11:56.174 --> 11:58.135
-The clock struck 1:00,
and down he run."
-(rhythmic clapping)

11:58.176 --> 11:59.886
-"There was a young man
from Bonaire,
-CROWD (in unison): Hey!

11:59.928 --> 12:02.472
-"who was screwing his wife
on the stair,
-Hey!

12:02.514 --> 12:04.307
"and the banister broke,
he doubled his stroke,

12:04.349 --> 12:06.143
-and finished her off
in mid-air."
-(cheering)

12:06.184 --> 12:09.896
Now give me a drink,
you son of a bitch.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.152
We got to meet this guy.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.820
Are you kidding?
You don't go near that

12:16.862 --> 12:18.488
without a net
and a tranquilizer gun.

12:18.530 --> 12:21.241
It'll be fine. We tell him
we want to buy some art.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.743
To show him we're serious.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.413
Oh, well, I didn't know you were
going to bring the painting.

12:26.455 --> 12:27.873
That's a completely
different story.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.418
Excuse me, Mr. Howell.

12:31.460 --> 12:34.713
I'm Miriam Maisel,
and this is Benjamin Ettenberg.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.882
He's a very big
admirer of your work.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.009
-Extraordinary.
-What?

12:39.050 --> 12:42.137
Your face, the color,
it's like...

12:42.179 --> 12:44.306
cream, or is it milk?

12:44.347 --> 12:47.267
It's some kind of...
magical dairy product.

12:47.309 --> 12:48.560
I don't know.

12:48.602 --> 12:51.104
I've been trying to find a color
like that for years.

12:51.146 --> 12:54.816
It's like Vermeer painted you
or you swallowed a light bulb.

12:54.858 --> 12:57.819
It's the latter. Did I mention
that this is Benjamin Ettenberg?

12:57.861 --> 13:00.906
And he's extremely interested
in buying one of your paintings.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.200
It's all he talks about.
He's desperate.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.327
And he's a doctor,
so he's got cash.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.913
We really need to discuss
the art of haggling someday.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.123
-What's that?
-What?

13:10.165 --> 13:12.042
That, in your arms.

13:12.083 --> 13:15.128
Oh, Benjamin took me to the
Solomon Crespi show tonight,

13:15.170 --> 13:16.379
and I bought this.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.632
You bought that
at the Crespi show?

13:18.673 --> 13:22.469
Yes. Well, no, not at the show.
In the backroom of the show.

13:22.511 --> 13:25.889
It's not his. It's, uh,
Agnes Reynolds'.

13:25.931 --> 13:27.724
It's Agnes Reynolds'.

13:27.766 --> 13:29.351
It came with a hat.

13:29.392 --> 13:32.437
-All right.
-All right, what?

13:32.479 --> 13:35.023
You want to buy something?

13:35.065 --> 13:37.067
Come to my studio tomorrow.

13:39.069 --> 13:42.239
Long as you bring her.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.241
MIDGE:
We did it.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.243
We got you in.
You're gonna buy a Declan--

13:46.284 --> 13:47.953
-What's his name?
-Howell.

13:47.994 --> 13:51.498
A Declan Howell. So exciting.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.500
Hey, we both bought
a painting today.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.502
-I'm not going.
-What are you talking about?

13:55.544 --> 13:57.921
He's clearly only
interested in you.

13:57.963 --> 14:00.298
He thinks I eat light bulbs
and drink fairy milk.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.926
If I don't take you,
he's not going to let me in,

14:02.968 --> 14:05.345
and I am not putting you
in that kind of situation.

14:05.387 --> 14:06.763
Oh, come on.

14:06.805 --> 14:08.557
I know how to handle
guys like that.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.392
I work comedy clubs, remember?

14:10.433 --> 14:12.561
Declan Powell would be
the best-behaved audience member

14:12.602 --> 14:14.229
-at a comedy club.
-Howell.

14:14.271 --> 14:15.855
Him, too.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.650
Trust me, I know how to handle
drunk, handsy guys.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.902
There's no part of this body
that hasn't been groped

14:20.944 --> 14:23.113
or poked or pinched or patted.

14:23.154 --> 14:25.031
-Lovely.
-Ooh, yeah.

14:25.073 --> 14:27.617
Last week, this club owner
kept dropping his pen.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.619
He'd crawl around on the ground
looking for it.

14:29.661 --> 14:32.622
Somehow, every time, he found it
right underneath my skirt.

14:32.664 --> 14:35.959
-That is a fantastic story.
-You learn how to deal with it.

14:36.001 --> 14:38.044
Keep your thighs locked,
keep your arms crossed.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.546
A well-timed "What's that?"

14:39.588 --> 14:41.339
never fails to defuse
an incoming pass.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.924
Chewing is a big lifesaver.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.259
Plus, the real saver

14:44.301 --> 14:46.720
that all those pervs
don't know about: girdles.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.722
In a girdle,
you can't feel a damn thing.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.849
These guys might as well
be groping a parking meter.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.810
So even if one does get through,
how the hell would I know...

14:53.852 --> 14:55.520
Okay. I feel much better now.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.023
Great. So, tomorrow,
we go get your painting.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.734
Trust me, I take
very good care of myself.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.986
I know.
But I'd like to volunteer

15:03.028 --> 15:06.406
to share those duties with you,
if you don't mind.

15:06.448 --> 15:09.117
You take the night shift?

15:09.159 --> 15:11.161
Deal.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.759
-This is me.
-Oh.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.302
So you do have a home.

15:27.344 --> 15:29.512
-BENJAMIN: I do have a home.
-It's tall.

15:29.554 --> 15:33.099
-BENJAMIN: I'm tall.
-So you kept it proportional.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.062
You okay?

15:37.103 --> 15:40.398
Yes. I am. I just...

15:40.440 --> 15:42.817
-This is...
-I know.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.819
I was married.

15:44.861 --> 15:47.781
I'm still married, on paper.

15:47.822 --> 15:51.159
You have very nice windows.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.456
Do you think you two might...?

15:56.498 --> 15:57.999
No.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.585
I just haven't...

16:00.627 --> 16:03.129
with anyone other than...

16:03.171 --> 16:05.131
So there's that.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.842
I just want you to know that
I'm actually very good at it.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.762
I can do it like gangbusters--
anywhere, anytime, vertically.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.181
You do not need to worry.
I'm like a pro.

16:13.223 --> 16:16.810
But, you know, not a moneymaking
pro, just a real gamer.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.436
In case you were concerned.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.480
That is a great relief,
thank you.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.901
-You don't have to come up.
-I know.

16:24.943 --> 16:27.445
-And if you do come up,
we don't have to...
-I know.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.448
We can just have a drink; I
could show you some paintings.

16:30.490 --> 16:34.494
I already had a drink, and
I already saw some paintings.

16:37.247 --> 16:41.418
I've never seen a hallway with
a bench in it before, though.

16:41.459 --> 16:44.421
It is pretty spectacular.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.589
Though "spectacular" takes on
a much different meaning

16:46.631 --> 16:48.633
once a person's met you.

17:01.312 --> 17:03.732
You are spectacular.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.236
I know.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.038
JOEL: It was a great party,
wasn't it?

17:19.080 --> 17:20.915
Did you see all those people?

17:20.957 --> 17:23.084
-I did.
-Who were they?

17:23.126 --> 17:26.504
-I think they work for you.
-For me? Doing what?

17:26.546 --> 17:28.798
I was going to head home.

17:28.840 --> 17:32.010
I have to take my sister to
the podiatrist in the morning.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.305
-Mrs. Moskowitz, have a drink.
-I hate leaving him like this.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.182
Today, I bought a building.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.434
A whole goddamn building.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.936
Went to a bank,
signed the thing.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.481
That story gets better
every time you tell it.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.816
-Is everybody gone?
-Everybody but them.

17:46.858 --> 17:48.902
Go on, Mrs. Moskowitz.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.862
-I'll deal with them.
-Are you sure?

17:50.904 --> 17:52.906
There's a lot
of sharp angles there.

17:52.947 --> 17:56.451
-I'll be fine.
-You're a good friend.

17:56.493 --> 17:59.412
Put a trash can by the bed.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.956
(bottles clink)

18:01.998 --> 18:03.958
If you're going to be
that available,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.753
you should consider putting
a doorbell on your blouse.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.379
What's she getting at?

18:08.421 --> 18:10.340
-VELMA: Beats me.
-It's getting late, ladies.

18:10.381 --> 18:13.009
-ARCHIE: Who belongs to this?
-VELMA: Me.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.595
Great. Here you go.
For your cab.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.972
Next.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.682
Jersey.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.518
JOEL:
Why is it so quiet here?

18:21.559 --> 18:22.936
We need some music.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.396
Mrs. Moskowitz,
turn on the radio.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.816
-Mrs. Moskowitz?
-She went home, Joel.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.776
Home? She's got a home?

18:29.818 --> 18:31.528
-Of course she does.
-Really?

18:31.569 --> 18:33.780
But she's always here. Whoa!

18:33.822 --> 18:37.200
Okay. Time to put you down.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.743
Nope! Not time.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.745
-I want to dance.
-(both chuckle)

18:40.787 --> 18:42.580
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.915
-She looks nice.
-Mm-hmm.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.333
Think she's Jewish?

18:45.375 --> 18:48.086
(grunts)
I do not think she's Jewish.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.548
Hey. My foot feels different.

18:51.589 --> 18:55.677
-I took off your shoe.
-You did? Neat.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.679
(grunts) Why don't you
call it a day, huh?

18:57.720 --> 18:59.430
What does that mean,
"call it a day"?

18:59.472 --> 19:01.641
What else would you call a day?

19:01.683 --> 19:05.103
Why do they keep coming up
with things to confuse us?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.479
Beats the hell out of me. Okay.

19:06.521 --> 19:08.273
-So, for the, uh...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.316
-I want to do a toast.
-ARCHIE: Joel.

19:10.358 --> 19:11.776
One more toast.

19:14.529 --> 19:17.115
To Archie Cleary.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.534
To your baby.

19:19.576 --> 19:22.287
Baby number three.
Congratulations.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.122
Thank you.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.916
You did it.

19:26.958 --> 19:29.752
You got the American Dream.

19:29.794 --> 19:32.714
Wife, family-- you got it all.

19:32.755 --> 19:35.216
And you knew how to keep it.

19:35.258 --> 19:36.676
That's the secret.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.887
Any schmuck can get it.
You knew how to keep it.

19:38.928 --> 19:42.015
Family's very important.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.475
You have to hold on to a family.

19:47.020 --> 19:50.523
One year. One year.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.525
(sighs)

19:52.567 --> 19:55.862
Mistake. Big fucking mistake.

19:55.904 --> 19:59.324
-Just go to sleep.
-It's my anniversary.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.743
One year since I...

20:04.329 --> 20:05.872
(exhales)

20:05.914 --> 20:09.250
I just want to be forgiven.

20:09.292 --> 20:12.086
Can't I be forgiven?

20:12.128 --> 20:14.714
I want to be forgiven.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.637
Mascara, blink, blot,
spritz, done.

20:20.678 --> 20:22.430
-Time.
-Whoa.
-Five minutes, 35 seconds.

20:22.472 --> 20:23.973
That's ten seconds
off my record.

20:24.015 --> 20:25.642
Let me see.
Still perfect, though.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.852
GINGER: Midge, Midge,
come, you have to come.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.604
-Where?
-There's a call for you
at the switchboard.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.189
I tried to tell them
you didn't work there anymore,

20:31.230 --> 20:32.732
but he wouldn't listen;
he is just crazy

20:32.774 --> 20:34.400
to talk to you,
right now, bitch.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.152
Sorry. That's what he kept
saying over and over.

20:36.194 --> 20:37.403
"Right now, bitch." Sorry.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.238
-And then he got angry.
-Oh, boy.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.074
He wasn't even talking to me,
he was talking to Loula.

20:41.115 --> 20:43.534
I heard him through her headset.
I swear to God, I've never--

20:43.576 --> 20:45.161
Oh, my God,
this is the makeup counter.

20:45.203 --> 20:46.621
-I'm actually here.
-(elevator bell dings)

20:46.663 --> 20:48.498
Smells so good.
Look at the light.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.583
-Come on, Ginger.
-And the windows.
You have flowers.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.752
-No one ever talked
about the flowers.
-(bell chiming over P.A.)

20:52.794 --> 20:54.545
Do you hear that?
Is that singing?

20:54.587 --> 20:56.756
-It sounds like angels singing.
-(woman speaking over P.A.)

20:56.798 --> 20:58.800
(busy chatter)

21:00.760 --> 21:03.721
LOULA: Why would you say that?
I did too finish high school.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.515
-Loula, let me take it.
-Hold on.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.100
Midge, if you are dating
this guy,

21:07.141 --> 21:08.685
you have got to break it off.

21:08.726 --> 21:11.479
-He's a monster.
-Believe me, I know.

21:11.521 --> 21:13.189
Hello?

21:13.231 --> 21:14.607
Tell the genius
who answered the phone

21:14.649 --> 21:16.818
she could've just hung up on me
if she wasn't so stupid.

21:16.859 --> 21:17.902
Is there a reason you are

21:17.944 --> 21:19.445
psychologically scarring
my coworkers?

21:19.487 --> 21:21.572
Phil Massarino, East Coast
booker we talked about?

21:21.614 --> 21:23.866
-He wants to see you.
-Great. When?

21:23.908 --> 21:25.910
Gaslight, October 12th.
Block that night out.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.954
-He likes you,
we are off and running.
-I can't.

21:27.996 --> 21:29.455
-You can.
-It's Yom Kippur.

21:29.497 --> 21:31.249
-Who gives a shit?
-Susie. Yom Kippur.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.669
High holidays. Break-fast.
Temple. Family. Guilt.

21:34.711 --> 21:35.795
There are gentile bookers

21:35.837 --> 21:37.588
who are gonna want to see you
on Yom Kippur.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.507
-There are?
-Well, there's one, and he does.

21:39.549 --> 21:41.175
-Any other night.
-God understands show business.

21:41.217 --> 21:42.969
-He invented it.
-Susie...

21:43.011 --> 21:44.637
October fucking 12th.

21:45.888 --> 21:48.141
-Okay. Put me on late.
-10:30.

21:48.182 --> 21:49.142
-Fine.
-Unless he says 8:00.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.352
-10:30.
-Happy New Year.

21:51.394 --> 21:52.937
(smacks lips)

21:52.979 --> 21:55.940
That one, that one, that one--
hold it.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.901
-Not that one. That one.
-Lady, they're livers.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.987
You're gonna grind them up,
for Christ's sake.

22:01.029 --> 22:03.322
-It just... it all ta...
-(door bell jingles)

22:03.364 --> 22:05.450
-Sorry.
-Where was I?

22:05.491 --> 22:07.744
Sorry I'm late.
Where are we? Livers?

22:07.785 --> 22:09.912
Livers. Mm, that's enough
of the livers.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.330
I need a leg of lamb.

22:11.372 --> 22:13.291
-Eight pounds.
-Lamb?

22:13.332 --> 22:15.543
I'm making brisket, and Moishe
doesn't like lamb, remember?

22:15.585 --> 22:17.503
-We should get a chicken.
-The lamb isn't for Moishe.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.505
-It's not.
-I had a little run-in--

22:19.547 --> 22:21.632
totally by accident--
with Rabbi Krinsky.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.593
-No.
-He happened to be
at the dry cleaners

22:23.634 --> 22:25.511
exactly when I just happened
to be at the dry cleaners...

22:25.553 --> 22:26.804
-No.
-...and we got to chatting,

22:26.846 --> 22:28.765
and after a little sweet talk,
a little flattery--

22:28.806 --> 22:30.558
-I mean,
he's lost so much weight.
-Really?

22:30.600 --> 22:32.310
No. Anyhow,
one thing led to another,

22:32.351 --> 22:34.437
and I mentioned the whole family
was gathering for break-fast

22:34.479 --> 22:36.981
and how we'd love to make it up
to him for last year, so...

22:37.023 --> 22:38.649
-We got the rabbi?
-We got the rabbi.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.902
-We got the rabbi.
-Now, it's just a quick stop-by,

22:40.943 --> 22:42.320
but you and I both know

22:42.361 --> 22:44.155
the rabbi cannot resist
a good leg of lamb.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.324
So, if the leg is good,
a stop-by becomes dinner.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.909
If a stop-by becomes dinner,

22:47.950 --> 22:49.869
then the disaster of last year
never happened.

22:49.911 --> 22:51.579
-Kind of happened.
-Never happened.

22:51.621 --> 22:53.498
-Mostly happened.
-It's very loud in here.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.291
Lutzi, get us a good leg.

22:55.333 --> 22:56.501
-A great leg.
-MIDGE: The best leg.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.086
Delivery tomorrow after 2:00?

22:58.127 --> 22:59.504
You got it, Mrs. Weissman.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.506
So, shall we go order the wine?

23:01.547 --> 23:03.382
-Let's go order the wine.
-Yes.

23:03.424 --> 23:07.178
BOTH:
We got the rabbi!

23:07.220 --> 23:10.848
Oh, we said that so loud.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.726
TESSIE:
Onion dip.

23:13.768 --> 23:15.394
-Potato chips.
-Over here.
-Okay, can we start?

23:15.436 --> 23:16.896
I can find some plates.

23:16.938 --> 23:18.439
-Tess.
-Just some little plates.

23:18.481 --> 23:20.483
-Pass the chips.
-I'm not done with them yet.

23:20.525 --> 23:22.527
-Just pass them down.
-This isn't your house, Skint.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.070
-It's not yours, either.
-It's my mother's.

23:24.112 --> 23:25.655
It's Tessie's mother, too.

23:25.696 --> 23:27.323
And Tessie's the one
over here all the time

23:27.365 --> 23:29.617
making sure that that old
boozehound mother of yours

23:29.659 --> 23:32.537
hasn't vomited herself,
so give me the fucking chips.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.123
-Here's your goddamn chips.
-What's up your ass?

23:35.164 --> 23:37.750
I found the plates.
Who needs iced tea?

23:37.792 --> 23:40.586
Let's just get started, please.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.797
The reason I asked you all
to come here today

23:42.839 --> 23:43.965
was to discuss something.

23:44.006 --> 23:45.800
I'm starting a business.

23:45.842 --> 23:47.927
-Whorehouse?
-(laughs) Whorehouse.
That's funny.

23:47.969 --> 23:50.471
-Hey.
-I'm starting
a fucking business,

23:50.513 --> 23:52.598
and I'm gonna--
Tessie, where are you going?

23:52.640 --> 23:53.891
I thought I'd get that iced tea.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.143
We're having a family meeting.

23:55.184 --> 23:56.394
You know I can't
understand things.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.937
The whole family has to agree.

23:57.979 --> 23:59.063
Skint agrees, I'll agree.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.023
Skint is not family.
He's barely human.

24:01.065 --> 24:03.276
-Not true.
-Tess, please, sit.

24:05.069 --> 24:07.405
-Thank you. Anyhow...
-How's the dip?

24:07.446 --> 24:09.407
Tess, focus for five minutes
here; it's important.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.534
You know I would never
call a family meeting

24:11.576 --> 24:13.411
if it weren't important;
last thing I want to do

24:13.452 --> 24:16.414
is put us all in the same room
if I didn't absolutely have to.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.999
But I am starting a business,

24:18.040 --> 24:20.042
and to do that,
I need some money.

24:20.084 --> 24:21.836
I'm not loaning you
a fucking cent.

24:21.878 --> 24:24.046
Really, Artie? I'm shocked.

24:24.088 --> 24:27.466
Absolutely stunned that you, the
last of the big-time scumbags,

24:27.508 --> 24:29.302
would not loan his sister
some money.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.429
-I don't know you're my sister.
-Ah, fuck.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.015
-You don't look like me.
-We look exactly-- fuck it.

24:34.056 --> 24:37.059
Never mind. I'm not asking you
for money, you bottom-feeder.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.061
You don't have any anyway.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.480
You are the saddest, brokest
motherfucker in the world,

24:41.522 --> 24:43.524
and I'm fucking ashamed
to be related to you.

24:43.566 --> 24:44.692
You don't know
you're related to me.

24:44.734 --> 24:47.653
I'm your fucking sister,
you giant piece of shit.

24:47.695 --> 24:50.865
-Can you pass the dip?
-Tess, down!

24:50.907 --> 24:52.742
(chips crunching)

24:52.783 --> 24:55.870
I think we should sell that land
that Grandma left to us.

24:55.912 --> 24:57.121
-What?
-No.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.498
I thought we were gonna build
a family home there.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.083
Grandma was the one
with that delusional vision.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.543
No one wants to live together,

25:02.585 --> 25:04.712
and no one wants to live
in Vermont.

25:04.754 --> 25:07.298
That-that land is just
sitting there, doing nothing.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.300
Costing us property taxes
every year.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.052
Let's sell it, split the money.

25:11.093 --> 25:13.930
-I know we could all use it.
-Skint and I are doing fine.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.806
Your husband has a wooden leg
that doesn't fit.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.225
That's why he's such a dick
all the time.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.185
You know how you get
a wooden leg

25:19.227 --> 25:20.436
that doesn't fit to fit? Money.

25:20.478 --> 25:22.313
Hey, who the fuck are you
to march in here

25:22.355 --> 25:24.273
-and start giving orders?
-What orders?

25:24.315 --> 25:27.318
"Tessie, sit. Tessie, down.
Don't get iced tea."

25:27.360 --> 25:30.071
I am not such a dick
all the time.

25:30.112 --> 25:32.865
All the time, 24 hours a day,
such a dick.

25:32.907 --> 25:35.201
I just want everyone
to be happy.

25:35.243 --> 25:36.869
Nobody's happy, Tess.

25:36.911 --> 25:39.497
I'm not happy, you're not happy,
these assholes aren't happy.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.624
Happy has skipped
this house altogether.

25:41.666 --> 25:43.793
I can't sit here and listen
to this without a beer.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.503
I can't have beer in the house.
Mom will drink it.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.381
I can listen to this,
or I can not have a beer.

25:48.422 --> 25:49.799
I can't do both.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.550
Mom will pour it
on her breakfast cereal.

25:51.592 --> 25:54.512
She'll wash her hair with it,
brush her teeth with it.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.223
-We can't have beer
in the house!
-I'm going to the bar.

25:57.265 --> 25:58.891
I'm going to the bar, too.

26:00.893 --> 26:04.397
I'll take that tea now.

26:04.438 --> 26:07.066
MIDGE:
Hello? Mr. Howell?

26:07.108 --> 26:08.943
BENJAMIN:
Let me go in first.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.990
Well, from the looks of this
place, he is extremely stable.

26:14.031 --> 26:16.617
Look at all these paintings.

26:16.659 --> 26:19.036
BENJAMIN:
Hello? Mr. Howell?

26:19.078 --> 26:20.496
DECLAN:
Come in!

26:20.538 --> 26:22.707
Come in. Come... Come in.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.333
-You're bleeding.
-I am.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.252
Thank you for noticing.

26:26.294 --> 26:27.837
Do you want me to take a look
at it? I am a doctor.

26:27.878 --> 26:29.922
Uh, no, thank you, Doctor.

26:29.964 --> 26:31.757
Um... wine?

26:31.799 --> 26:34.385
It's a bit early in the day,
I think, for a real drink.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.887
So, remind me, who are you?

26:36.929 --> 26:38.306
Oh, sorry.
We met last night.

26:38.347 --> 26:39.807
No, I know who you are.
Who's he?

26:39.849 --> 26:42.310
-Uh, I'm...
-Boyfriend.

26:42.351 --> 26:43.769
This is my boyfriend.

26:43.811 --> 26:46.772
-BENJAMIN: And a collector.
-He does both.

26:46.814 --> 26:48.983
The collecting
and the boyfriending.

26:49.025 --> 26:51.527
You said you were selling some
pieces and we should come by.

26:51.569 --> 26:52.945
Did I?

26:52.987 --> 26:55.197
I'm quite the scamp.

26:56.991 --> 26:59.618
One day closer to death.

27:01.579 --> 27:04.832
Your studio is quite impressive.
Mind if I take a look around?

27:04.874 --> 27:07.376
Quickly. I need to work.

27:09.837 --> 27:13.341
Wow. These are very good.

27:15.634 --> 27:19.221
-This one, how much?
-Not for sale.

27:19.263 --> 27:21.390
Oh, okay.

27:21.432 --> 27:23.392
This is terrific. How much?

27:23.434 --> 27:25.186
Not for sale.

27:25.227 --> 27:27.938
What about this? How much?

27:27.980 --> 27:30.441
-Not for sale.
-I wasn't holding anything.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.109
Well, aren't you
the clever dick.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.569
What exactly is for sale?

27:33.611 --> 27:35.571
My soul.

27:35.613 --> 27:38.824
-How much?
-Okay. We should get going now.

27:38.866 --> 27:40.826
I just need to check in
at the hospital first.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.662
-Do you have a phone?
-I don't have a sink.

27:43.704 --> 27:46.665
Fine. I'll go phone from the
coffee shop across the street.

27:46.707 --> 27:48.376
-Bring me back a sandwich?
-Absolutely.

27:48.417 --> 27:51.087
-Midge.
-Why don't I wait here for you?

27:51.128 --> 27:53.255
-What?
-I'd like to...

27:53.297 --> 27:55.383
look around a little more,
if Mr. Howell doesn't mind.

27:55.424 --> 27:57.343
Oh, God, I do love
the way you say that.

27:57.385 --> 28:00.012
(quietly): I am not
going to leave you here.

28:09.814 --> 28:11.565
(mouthing)

28:11.607 --> 28:13.484
(whispers):
You are insane.

28:17.780 --> 28:20.157
-(door opens)
-Well, you two found each other.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.450
(door slams)

28:23.452 --> 28:26.580
I don't understand why
you won't sell him a painting.

28:26.622 --> 28:29.625
He'd appreciate it.
He'd look at it at least.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.335
Do you even look
at any of these?

28:31.377 --> 28:33.254
The Allies have landed.

28:33.295 --> 28:35.172
Well, good for them.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.841
I think your paper
is a little old.

28:36.882 --> 28:40.553
It's time for a proper drink.
Join me.

28:43.889 --> 28:46.058
Who did that to your face?

28:46.100 --> 28:49.061
The landlord's wife.
Then the landlord.

28:50.855 --> 28:53.274
I don't think much
of your doctor.

28:53.315 --> 28:55.317
It's a good thing
you're not the one dating him.

28:55.359 --> 28:59.613
Is there anything I can do
to seduce you away from him?

28:59.655 --> 29:01.449
If you only had a phone.

29:01.490 --> 29:03.367
Touché.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.619
Fine. Stay with him.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.502
Tell me about the painting.

29:13.544 --> 29:14.795
What painting?

29:14.837 --> 29:17.798
Painting you were holding
at the bar.

29:17.840 --> 29:21.010
-How did you...?
-Agnes Reynolds was
the artist's name, I think.

29:21.051 --> 29:22.511
I can't believe it.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.430
-It came with a cat.
-Came with a hat.

29:24.472 --> 29:25.931
Ah, that's much better
than a cat.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.475
I thought you were blind drunk.

29:27.516 --> 29:30.060
I'm never quite as drunk
as people think I am.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.979
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

29:32.021 --> 29:33.606
I don't know anything about art.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.900
No one knows anything about art.
Why'd you buy it?

29:35.941 --> 29:37.651
I don't know.

29:37.693 --> 29:40.070
It's been a while
since I'd gone shopping.

29:43.032 --> 29:46.619
I walked in
that sad little room,

29:46.660 --> 29:49.788
in the back-- the one
nobody seemed to care about--

29:49.830 --> 29:55.127
and everywhere I looked,
there was color and life.

29:55.169 --> 29:58.172
Something the front room
was a little short of.

29:58.214 --> 30:00.758
And then suddenly
she caught my eye.

30:00.799 --> 30:04.178
I thought, "I know her.
She has a secret.

30:04.220 --> 30:07.139
She knows a joke that I don't."

30:07.181 --> 30:12.353
I thought, "Maybe if I take her
home, she'll tell me the joke."

30:12.394 --> 30:14.813
And that made me smile.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.112
(stubs out cigarette)

30:22.154 --> 30:24.156
All right.

30:32.915 --> 30:34.917
Secret door.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.337
Like Houdini.

30:38.379 --> 30:40.339
MIDGE: This isn't where
you store the bodies

30:40.381 --> 30:43.008
of the people who try to
buy your paintings, is it?

30:50.724 --> 30:53.769
This is the painting.

30:53.811 --> 30:57.231
I've heard the stories.
(chuckles)

30:59.316 --> 31:02.444
So tell me...

31:02.486 --> 31:05.864
does it make you smile?

31:05.906 --> 31:10.494
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.955
I mean,
it's so different from...

31:12.997 --> 31:14.707
My other work.

31:14.748 --> 31:16.542
Yes. No.

31:16.584 --> 31:19.920
I mean, your other work
is wonderful.

31:19.962 --> 31:22.673
Probably wards off vampires,
but this one...

31:22.715 --> 31:26.302
This one is perfect.

31:26.343 --> 31:27.845
But I don't understand.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.264
Why would you keep it
locked away in here?

31:30.306 --> 31:32.766
I mean, why don't you sell it?

31:32.808 --> 31:35.519
Sell it?

31:35.561 --> 31:39.481
Sell the greatest thing I'm ever
gonna do in my lifetime?

31:39.523 --> 31:42.443
Stick it in a gallery
and a doctor'd bring it home.

31:42.484 --> 31:44.153
A museum, then.

31:44.194 --> 31:47.031
Oh, yeah, what,
next to the mummies?

31:47.072 --> 31:49.199
People should see this.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.535
No, I painted this for me.

31:53.621 --> 31:56.415
This was gonna hang in my home.

31:56.457 --> 31:58.500
When I had a home.

31:58.542 --> 32:01.754
And a family,
when I had that life.

32:01.795 --> 32:04.798
This was...
this was gonna go there.

32:06.800 --> 32:09.053
But that was then.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.263
And this is now.

32:11.305 --> 32:13.515
I will never have that life.

32:13.557 --> 32:16.310
-Now, wait...
-I'm not trying
to spin a melodrama.

32:16.352 --> 32:17.645
I'm being very realistic.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.980
The chance for that life
is gone.

32:20.022 --> 32:21.774
That's ridiculous.

32:21.815 --> 32:27.613
It'll never happen because...
everything I have,

32:27.655 --> 32:31.241
I put into that.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.869
Nothing left.

32:33.911 --> 32:37.081
-I think that's very sad.
-Well, that's the way it is.

32:37.122 --> 32:42.961
If you... if you want to do
something great...

32:43.003 --> 32:47.716
you want to take something
as far as it'll go...

32:50.803 --> 32:54.223
...you can't have everything.

32:54.264 --> 32:59.770
You lose... family.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.814
Sense of home.

33:04.233 --> 33:09.238
But then... look at what exists.

33:14.368 --> 33:17.830
Are you sure I can't get you
to sleep with me?

33:17.871 --> 33:20.165
Nope.

33:20.207 --> 33:23.085
Even after I told you
my sad, lonely story?

33:23.127 --> 33:27.005
I mean, my God,
that was my very best line.

33:29.174 --> 33:32.302
-(door opens in distance)
-BENJAMIN: Hello?

33:32.344 --> 33:34.972
-(door closes)
-Miriam? Where are you?

33:35.013 --> 33:37.391
The doctor sounds panicked.

33:37.433 --> 33:40.769
I should go.

33:40.811 --> 33:43.689
Miriam?

33:43.731 --> 33:45.983
You never saw this.

33:47.985 --> 33:51.363
That's too bad.

33:51.405 --> 33:53.407
Miriam?

33:56.910 --> 33:59.496
Tell him to pick out
any painting he wants.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.206
Leave a check on the table.

34:01.248 --> 34:03.041
But don't tell me
where he lives,

34:03.083 --> 34:05.085
or I'll come back and get it.

34:14.595 --> 34:16.597
(ship horn blows in distance)

34:21.185 --> 34:24.188
-Where did this come from?
-I always hide a few for you.

34:24.229 --> 34:26.023
Thanks.

34:26.064 --> 34:29.067
Mmm.

34:29.109 --> 34:31.487
-How's Mom?
-Asleep.

34:31.528 --> 34:33.113
-Are you sure?
-I put the mirror
under her nose.

34:33.155 --> 34:34.656
Yeah, well, you have to
after last time.

34:34.698 --> 34:36.241
(laughs):
I know.

34:36.283 --> 34:38.744
(laughs): Five seconds away
from burying her alive.

34:38.786 --> 34:40.746
She was so mad. (laughs)

34:40.788 --> 34:42.706
You ever notice that,
in every one of these pictures,

34:42.748 --> 34:44.958
I'm standing three feet away
from the rest of the family,

34:45.000 --> 34:46.376
and you're crying?

34:46.418 --> 34:50.047
Well, I suppose every family
thinks they're the worst.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.508
Yeah, but ours
has photographic proof.

34:52.549 --> 34:54.301
TESS:
Stand-up comedy?

34:54.343 --> 34:56.303
Who knows from stand-up comedy?

34:56.345 --> 34:58.222
You do remember
I've been working in a club

34:58.263 --> 34:59.890
-for 16 years, right?
-Yeah, but I thought

34:59.932 --> 35:01.850
that was, like, singers,
jugglers, dog acts,

35:01.892 --> 35:04.311
that sort of stuff.
Stand-up comedy?

35:04.353 --> 35:05.813
(chuckles) I'll be damned.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.356
This girl, she's amazing.

35:07.397 --> 35:09.233
I have a whole plan
set up for her.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.318
I mean, it's all there.
I just need a little money.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.403
Why? Do you have to
pay the clubs or something?

35:13.445 --> 35:15.155
No, but we have to
get to the clubs.

35:15.197 --> 35:16.657
We have to tour.

35:16.698 --> 35:18.700
I need a car;
you can't tour without a car.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.953
Well, doesn't your comic friend
have a car?

35:20.994 --> 35:23.914
No. She's got, like,
40,000 hats but no car.

35:23.956 --> 35:26.041
Geez. Dilemma.

35:26.083 --> 35:29.545
-How are you doing?
-Oh, you know, terrible.

35:29.586 --> 35:33.215
The house is falling apart.
Skint leaves his leg everywhere.

35:33.257 --> 35:35.551
Mom could find booze
in a nunnery.

35:35.592 --> 35:38.679
Literally, she broke into
a nunnery last week.

35:38.720 --> 35:41.098
I did start flirting
with the delivery boy

35:41.139 --> 35:43.517
from the grocery, though;
he's got a wooden leg, too.

35:43.559 --> 35:47.104
-Well, you have a type.
-I do. Huh.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.814
You think there's any chance
Leopold and Loeb

35:48.856 --> 35:50.816
are gonna agree
to let me sell that land?

35:50.858 --> 35:53.402
-Nope.
-Yeah.

35:55.404 --> 35:57.281
Shit.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.788
-What's this?
-Keys to Mom's car.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.082
There's no way Mom's gonna
let me drive her car.

36:07.124 --> 36:08.959
When she took me to school,
I walked,

36:09.001 --> 36:10.419
and she drove alongside me.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.880
I'll tell her it was stolen,
by a nun.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.256
You sure?

36:16.508 --> 36:18.135
The highlight of my day

36:18.176 --> 36:21.096
is thinking up different ways
to kill my husband.

36:21.138 --> 36:23.140
One of us needs a win.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.059
Thanks, sis.

36:29.062 --> 36:32.524
-Beat him to death with his leg?
-I'll put it on the list.

36:34.818 --> 36:37.237
(crowd singing in Hebrew)

36:37.279 --> 36:39.615
(singing continues)

36:43.368 --> 36:45.621
-I'm starving.
-Don't think about it.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.664
I've been thinking about it
since dinner yesterday.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.583
-Shh.
-We've been without food
for 24 hours.

36:49.625 --> 36:52.252
Some people never have anything
but bread soaked in water.

36:52.294 --> 36:54.630
Oh, that sounds delicious.

36:54.671 --> 36:57.132
(singing ends)

36:57.174 --> 36:59.259
For the sin which we committed
before you...

36:59.301 --> 37:01.178
I noticed your kid's been
stuffing candy bars

37:01.219 --> 37:03.472
in his face
the entire ceremony.

37:03.513 --> 37:05.265
-Moishe.
-His face is covered
in chocolate.

37:05.307 --> 37:06.600
He looks like Al Jolson.

37:06.642 --> 37:08.518
Be quiet. We are in temple.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.604
That's right, and everyone
can see that we're talking,

37:10.646 --> 37:12.439
because these seats
are fabulous.

37:12.481 --> 37:15.442
-If only they were edible.
-Did you see Mara Weinstock?

37:15.484 --> 37:17.235
-Six rows back.
-RABBI: For the sin

37:17.277 --> 37:18.904
which we have committed
before you...

37:18.946 --> 37:20.864
-...committed before you...
-That's Catholic, Astrid.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.783
I just don't understand
why he gets to eat.

37:22.824 --> 37:24.368
I don't understand
why you get to sit.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.119
The elder can sit, rabbi said.

37:26.161 --> 37:28.288
We are the same age,
and I'm standing.

37:28.330 --> 37:31.208
Well, good for you.
You get to be king of the Jews.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.043
How'd that work out
for the last guy?

37:33.085 --> 37:35.128
And for the sin which we have
committed before you

37:35.170 --> 37:36.588
by a gathering of lewdness.

37:36.630 --> 37:39.341
Has anyone ever
had her diagnosed?

37:39.383 --> 37:41.343
She's the only one
actually praying here.

37:41.385 --> 37:42.678
ETHAN:
More chocolate, please.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.888
Try aiming for your mouth, kid.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.974
That's his third candy bar,
in case you weren't counting.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.017
He's four. A four-year-old
shouldn't have to fast.

37:49.059 --> 37:50.727
Not till he's bar mitzvah'd.

37:50.769 --> 37:53.563
When I was a boy, I fasted.
And you know why I fasted?

37:53.605 --> 37:56.149
Because we had nothing!

37:56.191 --> 37:58.026
Every day was Yom Kippur.

37:58.068 --> 38:00.320
Moishe, please. I'm atoning.

38:00.362 --> 38:03.991
For the things
I'd like to do to that man,

38:04.032 --> 38:05.909
-I apologize.
-That's right, sweetheart,

38:05.951 --> 38:08.662
let it out.

38:08.704 --> 38:10.414
For the sin which we have
committed before you,

38:10.455 --> 38:13.083
-by false denial and lying.
-And for the sin which we...

38:13.125 --> 38:15.669
Shirley, your mother
is tipping over again.

38:15.711 --> 38:17.796
Oh, it's okay,
I tied her to the bench.

38:17.838 --> 38:19.464
And for the sin which we have
committed before you

38:19.506 --> 38:20.674
by eating and drinking.

38:20.716 --> 38:22.968
For the sin which we committed
before you

38:23.010 --> 38:24.886
by embezzlement.

38:24.928 --> 38:27.931
And for the sins which we incur
the penalty of the four forms

38:27.973 --> 38:31.184
of capital punishment,
executed by the Court:

38:31.226 --> 38:35.689
stoning, burning, decapitation
and strangulation.

38:35.731 --> 38:38.066
RABBI and ASTRID: For all these
sins, O God of forgiveness,

38:38.108 --> 38:42.320
forgive us, pardon us,
and grant us atonement.

38:42.362 --> 38:45.782
(singing in Hebrew)

38:45.824 --> 38:47.826
(crowd singing along)

38:49.995 --> 38:53.415
(Rabbi and Astrid holding note)

39:02.132 --> 39:04.259
(Astrid holds note)

39:04.301 --> 39:06.970
(rabbi speaking Yiddish)

39:07.012 --> 39:11.058
-Here we go.
-(horn blows)

39:11.099 --> 39:13.351
(excited chatter)

39:13.393 --> 39:15.353
-I have nuts in my purse.
-Over here. I-I'll take some.

39:15.395 --> 39:16.772
-If you have one left...
-What?

39:16.813 --> 39:17.981
I won't have one left.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.524
Get in here and fight
for your nuts.

39:19.566 --> 39:20.984
-I'm gonna go ahead with Ethan.
-Hurry, hurry!

39:21.026 --> 39:23.111
See if I can hose him off
before dinner.

39:23.153 --> 39:24.863
Papa, wait, wait.

39:24.905 --> 39:27.491
-I need to talk to you.
-Shirley's nuts will be gone.

39:27.532 --> 39:30.327
-I have to leave dinner by 9:00.
-What are you talking about?

39:30.368 --> 39:32.412
I have a very big show tonight;
it's at the Gaslight,

39:32.454 --> 39:34.289
and it's for a booker,
and if I do well,

39:34.331 --> 39:36.625
it could mean more gigs,
more money.

39:36.666 --> 39:38.710
-(sighs)
-I need you to cover for me.

39:38.752 --> 39:40.837
-Cover for you? It's Yom Kippur.
-Hey, you're the one

39:40.879 --> 39:42.297
who wanted me to keep
my stand-up career quiet.

39:42.339 --> 39:43.924
Now, does this not
have to be a big deal.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.383
I've worked the whole thing out.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.344
Right after dessert,
I'll suddenly get a headache.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.055
I'll go lie down, and you
propose everybody play a game.

39:50.097 --> 39:52.349
Like "Name that
Homicidal Despot"?

39:52.390 --> 39:54.184
Or charades. Gather everyone
in the living room,

39:54.226 --> 39:55.977
and say you want to go first,
then position yourself right

39:56.019 --> 39:57.646
in front of the fireplace. That
way, they'll have to face you

39:57.687 --> 39:59.147
and they'll have their backs
to the front door.

39:59.189 --> 40:00.816
That gives me a chance
to slip out unnoticed.

40:00.857 --> 40:02.234
Now, earlier, you would've
cracked the door open

40:02.275 --> 40:03.819
and put a pair
of my shoes outside

40:03.860 --> 40:06.029
so I can tiptoe out barefoot
and no one will hear me.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.989
Later, when I get home,
I'll make an owl hoot sound,

40:08.031 --> 40:09.950
and you can come downstairs and
let me in the service entrance.

40:09.991 --> 40:11.368
-And then we can...
-Enough.

40:11.409 --> 40:12.994
I'm not playing charades,

40:13.036 --> 40:15.163
I'm not putting your shoes
outside the door,

40:15.205 --> 40:17.791
-or responding to your hooting.
-But...

40:17.833 --> 40:19.793
Tell them.
Tell them what you're doing.

40:19.835 --> 40:21.378
It's time.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.547
Are you sure?

40:23.588 --> 40:26.258
I am not going to lie for you
right after Yom Kippur.

40:26.299 --> 40:28.343
I'm not gonna blow
a year's worth of sinning

40:28.385 --> 40:29.636
in the first two hours.

40:29.678 --> 40:31.888
Okay. If you say so.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.306
And not a word about me knowing

40:33.348 --> 40:34.850
about this stand-up thing
ahead of time.

40:34.891 --> 40:37.602
-So you want me to lie.
-Like a Bible salesman.

40:37.644 --> 40:38.812
You want me to blow
a year's worth

40:38.854 --> 40:40.188
of sinning
in the first two hours.

40:40.230 --> 40:42.315
Sharp as a tack.
Now, do you have any more

40:42.357 --> 40:44.734
of Ethan's chocolate
in that purse of yours?

40:44.776 --> 40:47.028
-MOISHE: We forgot Bubbabosia.
-SHIRLEY: Thank God we tied her
to the bench.

40:47.070 --> 40:48.905
This isn't gonna look good
with the guy upstairs.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.158
-Mr. Bussman? Why would he care?
-Just go.

40:51.199 --> 40:54.828
God, I would kill for the hole
of the bagel right about now!

40:54.870 --> 40:56.580
(phone ringing)

40:56.621 --> 40:58.707
-Susie Myerson's office.
-Susie, it's me, it's Midge.

40:58.748 --> 41:00.542
If you're calling to cancel
tonight, I swear to God,

41:00.584 --> 41:02.752
I'm gonna have something really
big to atone for next year.

41:02.794 --> 41:06.464
I'm not canceling. But I do
have to tell you something.

41:06.506 --> 41:09.926
("Cheek to Cheek" playing)

41:09.968 --> 41:11.720
-Twist or olives?
-Olives.
-Extra olives.

41:11.761 --> 41:13.346
-Lots of olives.
-Do we have a little onion...

41:13.388 --> 41:15.390
(speaking Polish)

41:18.059 --> 41:20.061
(women conversing in Polish)

41:22.856 --> 41:25.108
Soak the beans at the end.
(speaks Polish)

41:25.150 --> 41:26.651
You do not know American beans?

41:26.693 --> 41:29.112
-Smells delicious, Zelda.
-Thank you, Miss Miriam.

41:29.154 --> 41:31.823
-At the end, the end, the end!
-I put baby down.

41:31.865 --> 41:34.451
(women continue chattering)

41:34.492 --> 41:36.369
SHIRLEY:
These latkes are delicious.

41:36.411 --> 41:39.456
-You changed your dress.
-Ethan got chocolate on it.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.790
-Here you go, Pop.
-Just put it down.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.083
It's gonna get warm.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.169
Do you control
the temperature now?

41:44.211 --> 41:46.171
No, I ju-- forget it.

41:46.213 --> 41:48.465
Drink it, don't drink it.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.676
Thank you for laying out
my options so clearly.

41:51.718 --> 41:53.470
-You look nice.
-Yeah?

41:53.511 --> 41:55.889
-Do I? Thanks.
-You okay?

41:55.931 --> 41:59.142
-Yes. Hungry.
-You sure that's it?

41:59.184 --> 42:04.105
♪ Seem to vanish like
a gambler's lucky streak... ♪

42:04.147 --> 42:06.608
-Really?
-Where are they going?

42:06.650 --> 42:09.110
These gatherings just keep
getting weirder.

42:09.152 --> 42:11.696
-Start over.
-(groans)

42:11.738 --> 42:13.740
(women continue chattering)

42:16.993 --> 42:18.954
I'm going to tell them
about the stand-up.

42:18.995 --> 42:20.789
-Tonight?
-Tonight.

42:20.830 --> 42:22.958
Yeah, I don't know if that's
one of your better ideas.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.793
It isn't mine, it's Papa's.
He's insisting.

42:24.834 --> 42:27.003
You have a room
full of unfed Jews in there.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.047
That's a lot of desperation
and rage in the air.

42:29.089 --> 42:31.508
-I know.
-Right now, they'd kill
each other for a garnish.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.885
I have a gig tonight.
I have to get out of here.

42:33.927 --> 42:35.679
-He won't cover.
-Maybe I can help.

42:35.720 --> 42:38.515
Create a diversion.
I can have a stroke. I'm 30.

42:38.556 --> 42:41.268
In the Maisel family, I
should've had one by now anyhow.

42:41.309 --> 42:45.063
-(women chattering)
-(dishes clinking)

42:45.105 --> 42:48.275
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

42:48.316 --> 42:50.694
That's Ethan's cereal.

42:50.735 --> 42:53.530
Yeah? It's good. Not as good as
the candy bar in temple, but...

42:53.571 --> 42:56.241
Just make sure that fucking
toy surprise is still in there.

42:56.283 --> 42:58.785
Look how he talks to his father
on the holiest of days.

42:58.827 --> 43:01.121
-You heard me.
-ZELDA: Two spoonfuls
of dressing per plate.

43:01.162 --> 43:03.415
Except Mrs. Weissman,
who doesn't eat dressing.

43:03.456 --> 43:05.041
Anyone who puts dressing

43:05.083 --> 43:08.420
on Mrs. Weissman's plate
will answer to me.

43:08.461 --> 43:11.381
Okay, let's go. Dinner is ready!

43:11.423 --> 43:13.550
-MIDGE: Wait, Zelda.
-Did she say dinner's ready?

43:13.591 --> 43:16.052
It's ready? It's ready.
Everyone to the table.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.054
ABE: If I eat one more onion,
I'm gonna throw up.

43:18.096 --> 43:19.848
I have to climb over the stool?
This is so stressful.

43:19.889 --> 43:21.641
-Just keep moving.
-Oh.

43:21.683 --> 43:23.351
Uh, Pop, you left your drink.

43:23.393 --> 43:25.937
(groans) Just worry about
yourself like you always do.

43:25.979 --> 43:28.356
-Are the salt shakers
on the table?
-Hey, a decoder ring!

43:28.398 --> 43:30.483
-You put that back.
-Fuck if I will.

43:30.525 --> 43:33.111
-Mama, you dropped a shoe.
-What? Did I?

43:33.153 --> 43:34.821
I'm not sitting
next to you tonight.

43:34.863 --> 43:36.656
-Oh, lucky me.
-ETHAN: I'm not hungry.

43:36.698 --> 43:39.284
-Shh.
-What you mean,
you're not hungry?

43:39.326 --> 43:42.746
-He had some candy earlier.
-He couldn't wait until dinner?

43:42.787 --> 43:44.789
Well, he's four.

43:44.831 --> 43:47.584
-That's little.
-Four-year-olds
in my village worked.

43:47.625 --> 43:50.295
They made shoes, they herded
sheep, they hid guns.

43:50.337 --> 43:52.422
ETHAN:
Yom Kippur is scary.

43:52.464 --> 43:54.883
I know, honey.
Go to your room, lock the door.

43:54.924 --> 43:56.092
Yes, I would.

43:56.134 --> 43:58.261
-Is that my toy?
-Not anymore.

43:58.303 --> 44:01.306
SHIRLEY: Moishe, the flowers.
Have you seen the flowers?

44:01.348 --> 44:04.100
My God, the flowers,
they almost don't seem real.

44:04.142 --> 44:05.226
-ROSE: They're real.
-They don't look real.

44:05.268 --> 44:06.561
-They are real.
-They don't look real.

44:06.603 --> 44:07.729
-Well, they are.
-Are you sure?

44:07.771 --> 44:09.189
-I'm sure.
-Excuse me.

44:09.230 --> 44:10.732
Could I have your attention
for a minute?

44:10.774 --> 44:12.650
Stop touching
the flowers, Shirley.

44:12.692 --> 44:14.611
I have something
I'd like to tell you.

44:14.652 --> 44:16.863
All of you,
on this special night.

44:16.905 --> 44:19.407
You're a fucking child.

44:19.449 --> 44:21.993
So this is a holy holiday
about atoning for our sins.

44:22.035 --> 44:24.788
And lying, keeping things
from the ones you love,

44:24.829 --> 44:26.956
-is a sin, and I have been...
-(Zelda speaks Polish)

44:26.998 --> 44:28.666
Ooh, lamb.

44:28.708 --> 44:30.627
Is there something
other than lamb?

44:30.668 --> 44:32.003
Don't worry, Moishe,
there's brisket.

44:32.045 --> 44:33.755
Oh, I just hope she made
those little potatoes.

44:33.797 --> 44:36.132
-I love those little potatoes.
-Um, Zelda, would you mind

44:36.174 --> 44:37.634
holding off on the food
for a minute?

44:37.675 --> 44:38.635
-What?
-ABE: Why?

44:38.676 --> 44:40.428
People are starving, Miriam.

44:40.470 --> 44:41.971
-It's going to get cold.
-I promise this'll be quick.

44:42.013 --> 44:45.266
-Give me the box back.
-(speaks Polish)

44:45.308 --> 44:47.811
As I was saying,
we are family, and families

44:47.852 --> 44:49.896
-should not lie to one another.
-Mm-hmm.

44:49.938 --> 44:51.898
Especially about something that
could affect everybody someday.

44:51.940 --> 44:53.900
This seems like
it's gonna take a while.

44:53.942 --> 44:55.443
I've got some pickles
in my purse.

44:55.485 --> 44:56.778
She is so resourceful, really.

44:56.820 --> 44:58.488
I should carry pickles
in my purse.

44:58.530 --> 44:59.906
So, as I was saying,

44:59.948 --> 45:02.242
a lot has happened
in my life over the last year,

45:02.283 --> 45:05.120
-and though I never really
planned it this way...
-Who wants a kosher dill?

45:05.161 --> 45:06.538
-Ooh, kosher dill.
-Over here, right over here.

45:06.579 --> 45:08.123
ASTRID:
I'll have a bite of Noah's.

45:08.164 --> 45:10.083
-Have your own, Astrid.
-No, only if there's extra.

45:10.125 --> 45:11.459
Astrid, take a fucking pickle.

45:11.501 --> 45:14.754
This last year has been
very challenging for me.

45:14.796 --> 45:18.466
And I found it leading me
in new directions.

45:18.508 --> 45:20.802
Unexpected directions.

45:20.844 --> 45:22.595
-Really unexpected.
-(snoring)

45:22.637 --> 45:24.055
ROSE:
Shirley, you forgot your mother.

45:24.097 --> 45:26.641
-Oh, I did. Oh, Moishe.
-I'm going, I'm going.

45:26.683 --> 45:28.309
Um, anyhow. Uh, about my life.

45:28.351 --> 45:30.019
-Pass the pickles.
-Papa.

45:30.061 --> 45:31.688
Well, this is taking
a very long time.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.398
There we go. Right over here.

45:33.440 --> 45:35.692
Zelda, you can
bring the food now.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.360
-Mama, I'm talking.
-Aren't you done?

45:37.402 --> 45:39.654
I haven't started.
Zelda, not yet.

45:39.696 --> 45:42.449
Anyhow, so, this last year has
been very challenging for me,

45:42.490 --> 45:43.741
-and...
-(doorbell rings)

45:43.783 --> 45:47.370
(Zelda speaks Polish)

45:47.412 --> 45:49.873
Hi. I was, uh, summoned.

45:49.914 --> 45:52.500
-Susie, come in.
-Uh, I think she's waiting

45:52.542 --> 45:55.170
-for my papers or something.
-Uh, just get in here.

45:55.211 --> 45:56.796
SHIRLEY:
Okay, pass the pickles down.

45:56.838 --> 46:00.175
MIDGE:
Please, take a seat.

46:03.261 --> 46:05.263
Mm. Comfortable chairs.

46:06.723 --> 46:09.684
I invited Susie to be here
tonight with us,

46:09.726 --> 46:12.228
to bear witness
to what I am about to say.

46:12.270 --> 46:13.730
-What happened to Zelda?
-What?

46:13.771 --> 46:15.773
Zelda. Usually answers the door.

46:15.815 --> 46:18.109
How do you know what Zelda
usually does? Who are you?

46:18.151 --> 46:20.737
-She's my friend.
-Yeah. Hi, Abe.

46:20.778 --> 46:24.032
Very good. Deducing that
I am Abe, Miriam's father.

46:24.073 --> 46:26.367
Hello, person
I've never met before.

46:26.409 --> 46:28.411
Nice to see you
for the very first time.

46:28.453 --> 46:32.081
Okay, so clearly I missed
a pretty hefty cocktail hour.

46:32.123 --> 46:34.542
All right. Everyone, please just
let me say what I need to say.

46:34.584 --> 46:37.587
-Not now, Zelda.
-(Zelda speaks Polish)

46:37.629 --> 46:39.672
I'm sure you've all noticed
that I've been acting

46:39.714 --> 46:41.799
differently lately,
staying out at night a lot.

46:41.841 --> 46:43.301
How would we know
you're staying out at night?

46:43.343 --> 46:45.553
There is a reason for this,
and the reason is

46:45.595 --> 46:48.890
I am pursuing a career
in stand-up comedy.

46:52.227 --> 46:53.811
-You what?!
-ROSE: Abe.

46:53.853 --> 46:55.688
ABE:
This is outrageous.

46:55.730 --> 46:57.482
How could you do this, Miriam?

46:57.524 --> 47:00.109
What a secret to keep
from your father.

47:00.151 --> 47:01.903
Rose, did you know this?

47:01.945 --> 47:03.279
-Of course I didn't know this.
-(doorbell rings)

47:03.321 --> 47:05.240
-I don't understand.
-You don't understand?

47:05.281 --> 47:07.492
What do you mean,
a career in stand-up comedy?

47:07.534 --> 47:09.327
(door opens)

47:09.369 --> 47:11.746
Hello. I'm Rabbi Krinsky.

47:11.788 --> 47:13.581
Come on in, Rabbi. Grab a seat.

47:13.623 --> 47:16.626
-We're gonna be here a while.
-Gut Yontiv, Rabbi.

47:16.668 --> 47:18.836
I've been working clubs all over
New York for months now.

47:18.878 --> 47:20.255
I'm getting pretty good.

47:20.296 --> 47:21.881
In fact, I have to leave
early tonight,

47:21.923 --> 47:24.384
because I've got a gig.
That's what we call it: a gig.

47:24.425 --> 47:26.844
A booker is coming to see me,
and if I do well,

47:26.886 --> 47:29.430
I'll get jobs in more clubs,
clubs outside of New York.

47:29.472 --> 47:31.432
You were a plumber at Steiner's.

47:31.474 --> 47:34.435
You came to fix our sink,
and when you left, it was worse.

47:34.477 --> 47:36.813
-She's not a plumber, Mama.
-I should say not.

47:36.854 --> 47:39.482
-That sink was not fixable.
-She's my manager.

47:39.524 --> 47:41.025
-Her manager for what?
-For my stand-up.

47:41.067 --> 47:43.069
-I can't believe you lied to us.
-SUSIE: I was under

47:43.111 --> 47:44.696
the impression there would be
food at this thing.

47:44.737 --> 47:46.906
I know it's a shock.
It was a shock to me, too,

47:46.948 --> 47:48.449
but I've seen her onstage,
and she's good.

47:48.491 --> 47:50.118
I think she could be
really successful.

47:50.159 --> 47:51.995
-As what?
-As a stand-up.

47:52.036 --> 47:53.580
But how did you meet
the plumber?

47:53.621 --> 47:55.915
She's-- Just try
to stay with me.

47:55.957 --> 47:57.834
-Who stays with the children?
-A lot of people.

47:57.875 --> 47:59.544
Well, why haven't you
ever called me?

47:59.586 --> 48:01.838
Is this why you've been
in such a rotten mood lately?

48:01.879 --> 48:03.089
What's wrong with me?

48:03.131 --> 48:04.632
My mood has nothing
to do with this.

48:04.674 --> 48:06.342
I just found out about this.

48:06.384 --> 48:08.344
My mood has been caused
by something

48:08.386 --> 48:10.430
and someone else entirely.

48:10.471 --> 48:13.099
-I see. Meaning me.
-My mood has been turned rotten

48:13.141 --> 48:16.269
by finding out
my son is a government spook.

48:16.311 --> 48:18.563
A fed! A killer.

48:18.605 --> 48:20.231
What are you talking about?

48:20.273 --> 48:22.275
I'm talking about
you being in the CIA.

48:22.317 --> 48:23.901
Who told you?

48:23.943 --> 48:26.279
That day at Bell Labs.
Do you think I'm an idiot?

48:26.321 --> 48:28.656
And then Astrid sang like
a canary for your mother.

48:28.698 --> 48:30.283
-You did?
-Oh, I don't know, maybe.

48:30.325 --> 48:32.577
I had been fasting
and I was weak and-- oh.

48:32.619 --> 48:34.954
Why am I always starving?

48:34.996 --> 48:36.497
Why is your manager a plumber?

48:36.539 --> 48:38.333
I don't see how
those two skill sets interact.

48:38.374 --> 48:40.043
Everyone, let's just calm down.

48:40.084 --> 48:42.045
I-I didn't mean
to start a whole thing.

48:42.086 --> 48:43.880
This is not what I wanted.

48:43.921 --> 48:46.090
Not everything in the world
is about you, Midge.

48:46.132 --> 48:48.092
Except this, which is
literally all about me.

48:48.134 --> 48:50.219
All right, let's put aside
the fact that your manager's

48:50.261 --> 48:51.971
a plumber for a second.
Does Benjamin know?

48:52.013 --> 48:53.848
-What?
-Who?

48:53.890 --> 48:56.225
Benjamin? Who's Benjamin? You
never told me about a Benjamin.

48:56.267 --> 48:58.186
Is this the guy you were hanging
out with in the Catskills?

48:58.227 --> 49:00.396
-Benjamin is not important.
-I just want to know
how he feels about it.

49:00.438 --> 49:02.023
Is it gonna affect
your relationship?

49:02.065 --> 49:04.692
-You have a relationship?
-SUSIE: This is not
the best time

49:04.734 --> 49:06.944
-to start a relationship.
-Yeah. You're just
starting a career.

49:06.986 --> 49:08.905
-We're gonna be touring.
-Touring. Yes.

49:08.946 --> 49:10.782
You can't have a relationship
when you're touring.

49:10.823 --> 49:12.617
Does Benjamin know this,
about the touring?

49:12.659 --> 49:13.868
You have to go
where the work is.

49:13.910 --> 49:15.662
That's right.
Listen to your husband.

49:15.703 --> 49:17.288
Maybe I should be going.

49:17.330 --> 49:20.124
I have another house to stop by.

49:20.166 --> 49:22.210
-Tell a joke.
-What?

49:22.251 --> 49:23.795
Tell a joke, one joke.

49:23.836 --> 49:25.546
Well, I don't really do jokes.

49:25.588 --> 49:26.714
Said you're going to be a comic.

49:26.756 --> 49:28.549
Seems you should
tell some jokes.

49:28.591 --> 49:31.511
Well, she's more of a stream
of conscious kind of comic.

49:31.552 --> 49:33.054
Yeah. Observational humor.

49:33.096 --> 49:35.306
I have no idea what
observational humor is.

49:35.348 --> 49:37.100
-You say you have a show
tonight, right?
-Right.

49:37.141 --> 49:39.435
-What are you gonna talk about?
-Well, I was gonna...

49:39.477 --> 49:40.853
talk about things.

49:40.895 --> 49:42.563
Things. Sounds hilarious.

49:42.605 --> 49:44.982
I was gonna talk about
personal things.

49:45.024 --> 49:48.069
Marriage, dating, maybe.

49:48.111 --> 49:50.655
I do a bit about secretaries
and their giant...

49:50.697 --> 49:52.949
Um, old bit, bad bit,
retired bit.

49:52.990 --> 49:55.993
Oh, I do a thing about Ethan
getting bullied at the park.

49:56.035 --> 49:57.787
Sounds terrible.
When did that happen?

49:57.829 --> 50:00.748
-It was a long time ago.
-And you make jokes about it?

50:00.790 --> 50:02.125
Well, I heighten it, you know,

50:02.166 --> 50:03.793
pretend I'm telling him
to fight back.

50:03.835 --> 50:05.461
"Mama didn't raise no pussies."

50:05.503 --> 50:07.338
-What does that mean?
-What park was that?

50:07.380 --> 50:09.966
No, I'm giving you an example
of one of my jokes.

50:10.007 --> 50:12.719
Miriam, you're a great-looking
girl, but I have to tell you,

50:12.760 --> 50:15.096
that joke was the pits.
Can you sing?

50:15.138 --> 50:16.139
-Pop.
-I'm just saying,

50:16.180 --> 50:17.974
a comedian has to be funny.

50:18.015 --> 50:19.976
Otherwise, they'd be called Abe.

50:20.017 --> 50:21.894
Nothing is funny
when you've been lied to.

50:21.936 --> 50:23.312
NOAH: You don't even know
what you're mad at.

50:23.354 --> 50:25.064
I have been working all my day
cooking this meal,

50:25.106 --> 50:27.024
and it is just sitting there
turning to nothing!

50:27.066 --> 50:28.985
-I know that I'm mad at you!
-For no reason!
-(clamoring)

50:29.026 --> 50:30.987
-Zelda, bring the food in.
-...knowing she was funny?

50:31.028 --> 50:32.822
-If you took one minute
to think about...
-You don't tell us?

50:32.864 --> 50:34.824
-Everyone, shut up!
-(clamoring stops)

50:36.242 --> 50:39.620
I'm pregnant!

50:39.662 --> 50:42.623
I was just waiting until
the right moment to tell you.

50:42.665 --> 50:44.459
(giggles)

50:46.461 --> 50:49.297
Congratulations.

50:49.338 --> 50:51.591
(quietly):
Thank you.

50:54.635 --> 50:57.221
Okay. Party's over, pal.

50:57.263 --> 51:00.433
You two, this is not where
you want to conceive your kid.

51:00.475 --> 51:02.018
Trust me.

51:02.059 --> 51:04.020
Time to go. Come on, pal.

51:04.061 --> 51:06.814
-I'm waiting for the next show.
-It's your lucky day.

51:06.856 --> 51:09.233
The next show is right outside.

51:09.275 --> 51:11.152
Yeah, keep walking.

51:11.194 --> 51:13.196
Keep moving, keep moving.

51:13.237 --> 51:16.073
Well, that was a great set.

51:16.115 --> 51:17.700
Felt like cheating.

51:17.742 --> 51:20.495
All I did was reenact
break-fast word for word.

51:20.536 --> 51:23.456
Who cares? That fucking gentile
pissed himself, which normally

51:23.498 --> 51:25.708
would revolt the shit out of me,
but not this time.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.960
-He loved me.
-He fucking loved you.

51:31.672 --> 51:35.051
-You know what this is?
-Scotch I can't afford?

51:35.092 --> 51:38.137
-This is our anniversary.
-Hmm. Don't get sappy.

51:38.179 --> 51:41.057
One year ago, on Yom Kippur,

51:41.098 --> 51:46.145
I gave my first performance,
got arrested.

51:46.187 --> 51:47.772
I met Lenny.

51:47.814 --> 51:50.316
You bailed me out.

51:50.358 --> 51:52.777
One year ago,
my husband walked out

51:52.819 --> 51:54.946
and my whole life fell apart.

51:54.987 --> 51:56.531
Yay.

51:56.572 --> 51:59.242
My old life ended
and my new life began.

51:59.283 --> 52:01.994
Everyone's out. I'm going home.

52:02.036 --> 52:03.496
You were on fire tonight, Midge.

52:03.538 --> 52:05.248
Thanks, Jackie.

52:05.289 --> 52:07.250
So what do we do now?

52:07.291 --> 52:09.460
So now I start
setting up a tour,

52:09.502 --> 52:11.879
get us on the road,
and we start making some money.

52:11.921 --> 52:13.297
You really think
I'm gonna be big?

52:13.339 --> 52:14.549
I think you're gonna be

52:14.590 --> 52:16.759
a massive pain in my ass
very, very soon.

52:16.801 --> 52:18.636
I want to be big.

52:18.678 --> 52:21.556
I want to be
the biggest thing out there.

52:21.597 --> 52:23.474
Tits up?

52:23.516 --> 52:26.519
-Tits up.
