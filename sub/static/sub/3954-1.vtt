the ball of light...

1:44:53.161 --> 1:44:57.372
...went right to my chest,
straight through me. Right here.

1:44:58.541 --> 1:45:02.544
And l knew it was gonna take me
where l needed to go, so l Disapparated...

1:45:02.712 --> 1:45:05.005

1:45:05.548 --> 1:45:08.050

left it to me, the Deluminator.

1:45:59.686 --> 1:46:04.690

to find my way back, and she'd lead me.

"There were once three brothers...

1:50:35.920 --> 1:50:41.132
...who were traveling along a lonely,
winding road at twilight.

1:50:43.010 --> 1:50:48.306
ln time, the brothers reached a river
too treacherous to pass.

1:50:48.641 --> 1:50:50.517
But being learned in the magical arts...

1:50:50.685 --> 1:50:55.855
...the three brothers simply
waved their wands and made a bridge.

1:50:57.191 --> 1:50:59.276
Before they could cross, however...

1:50:59.443 --> 1:51:03.572
...they found their path blocked
by a hooded figure.

1:51:03.823 --> 1:51:07.701
lt was Death, and he felt cheated.

1:51:07.868 --> 1:51:10.912
Cheated because travelers would
normally drown in the river.

1:51:11.080 --> 1:51:13.164
But Death was cunning.

1:51:13.791 --> 1:51:16.793
He pretended to congratulate
the three brothers on their magic...

1:51:16.961 --> 1:51:22.257
...and said that each had earned a prize for
having been clever enough to evade him.

1:51:22.800 --> 1:51:27.387
The oldest asked for a wand
more powerful than any in existence.

1:51:27.555 --> 1:51:32.142
So Death fashioned him one
from an elder tree that stood nearby.

1:51:33.561 --> 1:51:37.856
The second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate Death even further...

1:51:38.024 --> 1:51:42.444
...and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from the grave.

1:51:42.903 --> 1:51:47.198
So Death plucked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.

1:51:47.950 --> 1:51:51.911
Finally,
Death turned to the third brother.

1:51:53.122 --> 1:51:54.539
A humble man...

1:51:54.707 --> 1:51:58.918
...he asked for something that would
allow him to go forth from that place...

1:51:59.086 --> 1:52:02.255
...without being followed by Death.

1:52:03.341 --> 1:52:09.220
And so it was that Death reluctantly
handed over his own Cloak of lnvisibility.

1:52:12.600 --> 1:52:15.518
The first brother traveled
to a distant village...

1:52:15.686 --> 1:52:17.812
...where, with the Elder Wand in hand...

1:52:17.980 --> 1:52:21.733
...he killed a wizard
with whom he had once quarreled.

1:52:23.944 --> 1:52:27.489
Drunk with the power
that the Elder Wand had given him...

1:52:27.657 --> 1:52:30.742
...he bragged of his invincibility.

1:52:33.746 --> 1:52:37.207
But that night,
another wizard stole the wand...

1:52:37.375 --> 1:52:40.502
...and slit the brother's throat
for good measure.

1:52:40.711 --> 1:52:44.172
And so Death took the first brother
for his own.

1:52:44.882 --> 1:52:46.841
The second brother journeyed
to his home...

1:52:47.009 --> 1:52:50.011
...where he took the stone
and turned it thrice in hand.

1:52:50.179 --> 1:52:54.641
To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped
to marry before her untimely death...

1:52:54.809 --> 1:52:57.185
...appeared before him.

1:52:57.687 --> 1:53:02.982
Yet, soon she turned sad and cold
for she did not belong in the mortal world.

1:53:03.150 --> 1:53:04.776
Driven mad with hopeless longing...

1:53:04.944 --> 1:53:08.238
...the second brother killed himself
so as to join her.

1:53:09.448 --> 1:53:12.534
And so Death took the second brother.

1:53:12.702 --> 1:53:14.369
As for the third brother...

1:53:14.537 --> 1:53:18.748
...Death searched for many years
but was never able to find him.

1:53:18.916 --> 1:53:21.835
Only when he attained a great age
did the youngest brother...

1:53:22.002 --> 1:53:26.256
...shed the Cloak of lnvisibility
and give it to his son.

1:53:27.508 --> 1:53:31.636

and went with him gladly...
