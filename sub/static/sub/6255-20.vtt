00:08.353 --> 00:10.154
What you got? Hey...!

00:15.693 --> 00:17.528
Stick with it!

00:25.570 --> 00:27.605
Hey! Go, go!

00:33.645 --> 00:35.179
Caught a scent down that way!

00:36.014 --> 00:38.349
Follow him now!

00:41.820 --> 00:44.154
Hey!

00:44.189 --> 00:46.290
Down here! Hey!

00:49.060 --> 00:50.961
Easy! Hey!
Easy, easy!

00:56.935 --> 00:58.002
Get me out of here!

00:58.036 --> 00:59.637
Take me back to jail!

00:59.671 --> 01:01.572
I want to go back!

01:01.606 --> 01:03.040
Here, boy, here!

01:19.124 --> 01:20.958
Hey, hey, hey!

01:20.992 --> 01:22.559
Look at that.

01:22.594 --> 01:24.028
Huh? Right?

01:24.062 --> 01:26.030
I'm gonna hang that
on the fridge.

01:26.064 --> 01:28.766
Your shooting arm usually tires
after this amount of time.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.268
Well, you know, a lot of push-ups,
pull-ups, my daily running.

01:31.303 --> 01:33.270
I'm gonna ace
this Bureau's competency test.

01:33.305 --> 01:35.785
Are you been preparing for the
mental portion of the exam, too?

01:35.807 --> 01:36.807
I know what I'm doing.

01:36.841 --> 01:38.208
Okay? Look.

01:38.243 --> 01:40.277
They're gonna ask me
some stupid questions.

01:40.312 --> 01:42.413
And I'll score
in the 90th percentile,

01:42.447 --> 01:45.082
like I always do,
every year.

01:45.116 --> 01:48.018
I assume you wanted to score
higher than the 90th percentile.

01:48.053 --> 01:49.620
There are games and applications

01:49.654 --> 01:51.155
to help hone your critical
thinking skills.

01:51.189 --> 01:52.990
I got my gut.

01:54.292 --> 01:56.627
You're very set in your ways.

01:56.661 --> 01:57.728
I'm not set in my ways.

01:57.762 --> 01:59.496
I never have been,
I never will be.

01:59.531 --> 02:01.799
Okay.

02:01.833 --> 02:03.300
Whoa, look at that, huh?

02:03.335 --> 02:05.936
Maybe we can get you a game
for your shooting.

02:05.971 --> 02:07.271
Booth.

02:07.305 --> 02:09.539
Yeah, okay.
Okay, great, on our way.

02:09.574 --> 02:12.343
Listen, we got a body in, uh,
Great Falls National Park.

02:12.377 --> 02:13.844
Okay. I'll drive.

02:13.878 --> 02:15.212
I always drive.

02:15.246 --> 02:16.847
I know,
but since you're not set

02:16.881 --> 02:18.582
in your ways,
it'll be a nice change.

02:18.616 --> 02:20.818
Well... what-what
do you mean "nice change"?

02:20.852 --> 02:23.253
I always drive the car.

02:23.288 --> 02:25.022
All I'm saying is
that you could benefit

02:25.056 --> 02:26.156
by not being so stubborn.

02:26.191 --> 02:27.191
I let you drive.

02:27.225 --> 02:28.459
How is that being stubborn?

02:28.493 --> 02:30.327
Even though you told me,
the whole time,

02:30.362 --> 02:32.062
I was driving the wrong way?

02:32.097 --> 02:33.430
What-wha-what
are you t-talking about?

02:33.465 --> 02:34.698
I was helping you out,
all right?

02:34.733 --> 02:36.133
Now, that is you being stubborn.

02:36.167 --> 02:37.768
We got here, didn't we?
You finally made it.

02:37.802 --> 02:41.105
We did.
Just in time to open the present.

02:42.807 --> 02:44.775
Oh, whoa!

02:44.809 --> 02:46.410
Very cool.

02:46.444 --> 02:47.778
Oh!
Wow!

02:47.812 --> 02:48.779
Really? Seriously?

02:48.813 --> 02:49.947
I mean, d-don't you guys

02:49.981 --> 02:52.016
ever get revolted
by this stuff?

02:52.050 --> 02:53.283
I mean, come on!
Look at him!

02:53.318 --> 02:54.451
He's folded in half
like an omelet.

02:54.486 --> 02:55.452
And I'm assuming he didn't

02:55.487 --> 02:56.520
just crawl in there himself.

02:57.455 --> 02:58.722
<i>Cossoidea,</i>

02:58.757 --> 03:00.591
<i>Camponotus</i>
<i>pennsylvanicus...</i>

03:00.625 --> 03:02.092
So, most of these bugs

03:02.127 --> 03:05.095
are residents of the log,
not the remains.

03:05.130 --> 03:06.764
The nearest road around here's
about two miles,

03:06.798 --> 03:08.632
so this is definitely not
a drag and dump situation.

03:08.666 --> 03:09.666
These remains are

03:09.701 --> 03:11.001
severely degraded

03:11.036 --> 03:12.970
and riddled with holes.

03:13.004 --> 03:14.338
The fungus on
these clothes says

03:14.372 --> 03:15.973
the victim's been here
less than a year.

03:16.007 --> 03:17.574
I mean, I'll be able
to be more specific

03:17.609 --> 03:19.276
once I get these spores
back to the lab.

03:19.310 --> 03:21.111
Well, these bones are
being eaten by termites.

03:21.112 --> 03:22.479
Termites?

03:22.514 --> 03:23.614
Actually, yeah,
termites have been known

03:23.648 --> 03:25.449
to eat bone for the nitrogen.

03:25.483 --> 03:26.817
The sharp nasal sill

03:26.851 --> 03:28.052
suggests Caucasian,

03:28.086 --> 03:29.953
the presence of a Ventral arc

03:29.988 --> 03:32.756
indicates female.
Look, guys.

03:32.791 --> 03:34.825
There's a lot of bugs
crawling in here.

03:34.859 --> 03:36.026
Well, we uncorked
the scent of death.

03:36.061 --> 03:37.494
It's gonna
attract thousands.

03:37.529 --> 03:38.662
Bones, what do you say we just,
you know,

03:38.696 --> 03:39.930
get her back to the lab?

03:39.964 --> 03:41.298
Come on.
I'm still working, Booth.

03:41.332 --> 03:42.566
Aah, geez!

03:42.600 --> 03:43.667
Something's crawling
up my pants.

03:43.701 --> 03:44.735
Oh, yeah. It's probably

03:44.769 --> 03:46.136
an alderfly.
They like it up there.

03:46.171 --> 03:48.505
'Cause, you know,
it's warm, toasty.

03:48.540 --> 03:49.540
You hang out with the termites.

03:49.574 --> 03:50.808
I'm going back to the car.

03:50.842 --> 03:51.809
Forget this.

03:51.843 --> 03:53.977
I'm out.

03:56.181 --> 03:59.383
There are so many bugs
I can barely see the remains.

03:59.417 --> 04:01.417
How soon can you
remove them, Dr. Hodgins?

04:01.419 --> 04:02.686
I need the bones clean.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.155
I gotta finish
removing the clothing.

04:05.190 --> 04:08.292
Then I'll try to pull DNA
from this hair and scalp tissue,

04:08.326 --> 04:10.394
and start running it
through CODIS.

04:10.428 --> 04:11.995
Well, I hope you find a match,

04:12.030 --> 04:14.131
because the bugs'
little facial feast here

04:14.165 --> 04:16.266
is gonna make
a reconstruction impossible.

04:16.301 --> 04:17.801
All right, based on
the <i>Aspergillus</i> spores

04:17.836 --> 04:20.303
and the <i>Stachybotrys</i>
<i>chartarum</i> colonies,

04:20.338 --> 04:22.005
the victim was dumped
four months ago.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.675
Ah, I love the smell
of science in the morning.

04:24.709 --> 04:26.076
Mr. Bray!
Wendell!

04:26.111 --> 04:27.177
Hey!

04:27.212 --> 04:28.378
Mr. Bray,

04:28.413 --> 04:29.746
very good to have you back.

04:29.781 --> 04:31.415
This guy,

04:31.449 --> 04:33.350
rocking the naked noggin.

04:33.384 --> 04:35.886
Sorry, let's not
make this about me.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.921
I actually think you're
kind of making the cancer thing

04:37.956 --> 04:39.356
very sexy, Wendell.

04:39.390 --> 04:41.258
Ewing's sarcoma has

04:41.292 --> 04:42.626
an 80% mortality rate, Angela.

04:42.660 --> 04:43.927
That's not sexy.

04:43.962 --> 04:46.130
Thanks for the reminder, Dr. B.

04:46.164 --> 04:47.898
My pleasure.

04:47.932 --> 04:49.566
Your treatment
must've been pretty intense.

04:49.601 --> 04:51.361
Are you sure you're ready
to be back at work?

04:51.369 --> 04:53.937
Being here is like vacation
compared to chemo.

04:53.972 --> 04:55.606
There's a slight incidence

04:55.640 --> 04:56.673
of erosive lesions on the

04:56.708 --> 04:58.709
metacarpophalangeal joints.

04:58.743 --> 04:59.977
And a lot of bugs.

05:00.011 --> 05:01.678
That, coupled with the multiple

05:01.713 --> 05:04.681
remodeled thoracic
vertebral body fractures.

05:04.716 --> 05:05.816
That suggests the victim

05:05.850 --> 05:07.084
may have suffered from lupus.

05:07.118 --> 05:08.552
No wonder you missed me.

05:08.586 --> 05:10.220
But lupus
has been known

05:10.255 --> 05:12.122
to cause terrible pain
and organ failure.

05:12.157 --> 05:14.658
Maybe we're dealing
with a mercy killing.

05:16.995 --> 05:18.235
I wasn't suggesting that having

05:18.263 --> 05:20.164
a serious illness
makes life not worth...

05:20.198 --> 05:23.133
I-I don't want any tiptoeing
around my illness, okay?

05:23.168 --> 05:25.402
I have cancer.
It's part of my life.

05:25.436 --> 05:27.070
For now.

05:27.972 --> 05:28.972
Yes, for now.

05:29.007 --> 05:29.973
So, we just have to accept...

05:30.008 --> 05:31.575
I'm sorry, but is

05:31.609 --> 05:34.244
that distal phalanx
crawling away?

05:34.279 --> 05:37.681
Yeah, I should really probably
get rid of these bugs.

I know you help put the mental
part of the test together.

06:18.842 --> 06:20.576
Right, but that doesn't mean I
can give you the answers, Booth.

06:20.610 --> 06:21.877
I'm not looking
for the answers, okay?

06:21.912 --> 06:23.212
I'm just trying to see what kind

06:23.246 --> 06:24.613
of questions are gonna
be on the test.

06:24.648 --> 06:25.781
The test is day after tomorrow.

06:25.816 --> 06:26.782
Don't you feel ready?

06:26.817 --> 06:27.783
Come on, I was born ready.

06:27.818 --> 06:28.818
Are you kidding me, huh?

06:28.852 --> 06:29.985
Look at my past scores.

06:30.020 --> 06:31.454
Never scored nothing
lower than 90%.

06:31.488 --> 06:32.688
Well, then I'm sure
you'll be fine.

06:32.722 --> 06:33.923
Yeah, forget I asked.

06:33.957 --> 06:37.760
Just take a look
at the pictures there.

06:45.368 --> 06:47.002
So, what do you think?

06:47.037 --> 06:49.638
who hides a body in an old log?

06:49.673 --> 06:51.807
You think Cam is right?
This was a mercy killing?

06:51.842 --> 06:53.342
No, whoever disposed of the body

06:53.376 --> 06:55.945
showed no respect,
no care for her, uh...

06:55.979 --> 06:57.379
Was the victim killed
at the scene

06:57.414 --> 06:58.814
or was she dragged
to the log?

06:58.849 --> 07:00.049
Do you know?
We don't know yet.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.484
She's been there four months.

07:01.518 --> 07:03.319
All this bad weather has
washed the evidence away.

07:03.353 --> 07:06.055
Now, my guess is that
it was a spontaneous act.

07:06.089 --> 07:08.324
Otherwise a grave
would've been dug, right?

07:08.358 --> 07:11.861
Great. Cam ran the DNA, but
the victim wasn't in the system.

07:11.895 --> 07:13.696
Now we don't know who
we're dealing with.

07:13.730 --> 07:16.298
So, you want to do better
than the 90th percentile then?

07:16.333 --> 07:17.733
I just want to solve this case.

07:17.767 --> 07:19.001
Let's stop talking
about the test.

07:19.035 --> 07:20.102
All right.

07:20.136 --> 07:22.104
I always do well.

07:26.309 --> 07:28.611
So this is what
the future looks like.

07:28.645 --> 07:30.880
Yeah, and to think,
a couple of months ago,

07:30.914 --> 07:32.648
this room was
a janitor's closet.

07:32.682 --> 07:33.983
I am so glad it's gone.

07:34.017 --> 07:35.718
I can't imagine
how many relationships

07:35.752 --> 07:38.821
began and ended in here.
Right?

07:38.855 --> 07:41.257
I'd like to officially
introduce you

07:41.291 --> 07:43.359
to the Jeffersonian's

07:43.393 --> 07:47.229
new Three-Dimensional
Holographic Emulation Outlet.

07:47.264 --> 07:49.798
Or THEO for short.

07:49.833 --> 07:53.302
Well, I've captured the contours
of the victim's skull.

07:53.336 --> 07:55.771
I feel like I should be
wearing silly glasses

07:55.805 --> 07:57.339
and eating popcorn.

07:57.374 --> 07:59.141
I'll have some next time -

07:59.175 --> 08:02.311
I'll pop in
a couple of eyeballs...

08:05.048 --> 08:07.416
Apply the muscle...

08:10.921 --> 08:12.688
Add the skin...

08:12.722 --> 08:14.590
And the hair...

08:17.127 --> 08:18.761
And we have our victim.

08:18.795 --> 08:20.362
Okay.

08:20.397 --> 08:21.564
Money well-spent.

08:21.598 --> 08:22.731
Now, we run the hologram

08:22.766 --> 08:25.067
through Missing Persons.

08:27.037 --> 08:29.605
How do you think, uh,
Wendell is doing?

08:29.639 --> 08:31.106
He's a little thinner.

08:31.141 --> 08:32.875
But his work is superb.

08:32.909 --> 08:33.909
I'm impressed.

08:33.943 --> 08:35.578
Yeah. Me, too.

08:35.611 --> 08:37.011
And I'm angry.

08:37.047 --> 08:39.181
Old people die, not Wendell.

08:39.215 --> 08:40.849
Wendell's very much alive,
Angela.

08:40.884 --> 08:42.650
And that's how he wants us
to see him.

08:42.686 --> 08:44.753
Yeah, but his odds...
We have to do what he's doing.

08:44.788 --> 08:46.522
Focus on what's possible.

08:50.860 --> 08:52.361
I officially love THEO.

08:52.395 --> 08:54.797
We have our victim.

08:54.831 --> 08:58.233
28-year-old Abby Briggs.

08:58.268 --> 09:00.970
Reported missing by her sister
four months ago.

09:02.772 --> 09:04.406
<i>We're very sorry for the loss</i>

09:04.441 --> 09:06.208
of your sister, Ms. Briggs.

09:06.242 --> 09:08.243
Had your sister
received any threats?

09:08.278 --> 09:11.146
I mean, did she mention anyone
who'd want to do this to her?

09:11.181 --> 09:12.915
No.

09:12.949 --> 09:15.951
But... we were busy, so I...

09:15.986 --> 09:19.021
sometimes we wouldn't talk
for a few weeks at a time.

09:19.055 --> 09:20.122
Your sister had lupus?

09:20.156 --> 09:21.457
Yes.

09:21.491 --> 09:23.392
She was diagnosed
three years ago.

09:23.426 --> 09:25.227
It was horrible.

09:25.261 --> 09:26.895
I mean...

09:26.930 --> 09:28.530
she even had to drop out
of art school

09:28.565 --> 09:30.866
because it was
too painful to draw.

09:30.900 --> 09:33.602
Based on the amount of remodeled
vertebral fractures,

09:33.637 --> 09:36.605
her case had
to have been severe.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.741
Yeah, she was in constant pain.

09:38.775 --> 09:41.443
Which is why
she was self-medicating.

09:41.478 --> 09:43.012
"Self-medicating"?
You mean she was...

09:43.046 --> 09:44.680
Was she doing illegal drugs?

09:44.714 --> 09:45.781
Oh, God, no, no.

09:45.815 --> 09:46.849
She was using cannabis

09:46.883 --> 09:48.317
to treat the pain.

09:48.351 --> 09:49.918
That could've been
very effective for her.

09:49.953 --> 09:51.286
Well, it is still illegal.

09:51.321 --> 09:52.721
And being in contact
with drug dealers

09:52.756 --> 09:54.289
can be very dangerous.
No.

09:54.324 --> 09:56.058
No, this was all legal.

09:56.092 --> 09:58.027
Her doctor recommended it.

09:58.061 --> 10:00.295
And she had
her medical marijuana card.

10:00.330 --> 10:01.864
Did it help her?

10:01.898 --> 10:03.399
Abby had a bad reaction
to pharmaceuticals,

10:03.433 --> 10:05.467
and the cannabis
definitely helped.

10:05.502 --> 10:07.703
I mean, she was even
able to draw again.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.638
She was so grateful,
she even got a job

10:09.673 --> 10:11.240
at the dispensary.

10:11.274 --> 10:13.742
We're go.na need the name
of that dispensary.

10:13.777 --> 10:15.244
Oh, sure. It's, um,

10:15.278 --> 10:16.512
it's the Full Health

10:16.546 --> 10:18.881
Wellness Center.

10:18.915 --> 10:21.583
Abby said the doctor there
saved her life.

10:26.923 --> 10:29.124
You're gonna use pen and paper
to remove the termites?

10:29.159 --> 10:30.592
Pretty cool, huh?

10:30.627 --> 10:32.661
What are you gonna do?
Write "No Termites Allowed"?

10:32.696 --> 10:34.229
Hey, you want clean bones,
don't you?

10:34.264 --> 10:35.931
Watch and learn.

10:35.965 --> 10:38.867
Now, termites are guided
by pheromones,

10:38.902 --> 10:41.036
so the black ink in the pen

10:41.071 --> 10:44.273
mimics the characteristics
of their trail-making pheromone.

10:44.307 --> 10:45.808
So you're gonna trick them

10:45.842 --> 10:48.877
into thinking this is a trail
leading from the bone?

10:48.912 --> 10:50.612
It's the least barbaric method
I could think of.

10:50.647 --> 10:51.747
Mm.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.315
And if it works on this,

10:53.349 --> 10:54.783
it'll work on the rest
of the bones.

10:54.818 --> 10:56.585
Oh, my God!

10:56.619 --> 10:58.353
You're the Pied Piper
of termites.

10:58.388 --> 11:00.322
Pretty cool, huh?

11:03.326 --> 11:04.927
I gotta tell you, Wendell,

11:04.961 --> 11:07.129
for a guy who's just had
a bunch of cytotoxic chemicals

11:07.163 --> 11:09.465
pumped into his body,
you appear to be doing great.

11:09.499 --> 11:10.833
I don't really have a choice.

11:10.867 --> 11:12.868
You do whatever you have
to to get by, right?

11:12.902 --> 11:15.104
Well, you' a stronger
man than I am.

11:15.138 --> 11:18.207
Making you look bad is one
of the things that keeps me going.

11:19.909 --> 11:21.443
Hey, that's not termite damage.

11:21.478 --> 11:23.245
There's a Monteggia's fracture

11:23.279 --> 11:25.647
to the proximal end
of the ulna.

11:26.850 --> 11:28.550
Huh.

11:28.585 --> 11:32.154
More evidence of diffused
blunt-force trauma

11:32.188 --> 11:33.622
to the right ulna as well.

11:33.656 --> 11:35.124
Defensive wounds?

11:35.158 --> 11:38.127
Yeah. Our victim didn't
go down without a fight.

11:40.964 --> 11:45.033
<i>I can't believe we're driving</i>
<i>to a pot store.</i>

11:45.068 --> 11:47.002
Cannabis is a reasonable
alternative method

11:47.036 --> 11:50.572
of treating glaucoma,
nausea, seizures.

11:50.607 --> 11:52.274
Hey, Bones, I'm
a federal agent, okay?

11:52.308 --> 11:54.343
So, on a federal level,
marijuana's still illegal.

11:54.377 --> 11:57.446
But you're a resident of
the District of Columbia, where it is not.

11:57.447 --> 11:59.481
Why are we having
this argument, all right?

11:59.516 --> 12:01.383
Let's just stop, all right?
I took an oath.

12:01.417 --> 12:02.651
So from where I sit,
the law is clear.

12:02.685 --> 12:04.153
But cannabis has been used

12:04.187 --> 12:06.889
for thousands of years
in a medicinal capacity.

12:06.923 --> 12:11.126
Even the ancient Egyptians used
marijuana to treat hemorrhoids.

12:11.161 --> 12:12.628
Which, you know,
they probably got

12:12.662 --> 12:14.163
from sitting around
being stoned all day.

12:14.197 --> 12:16.098
You're so set in your ways.

12:16.132 --> 12:19.001
What, you think a couple hits
from a, you know, a bong

12:19.035 --> 12:20.702
might help my critical
thinking skills?

12:25.975 --> 12:30.479
Dr. Burke, these
are federal agents.

12:31.948 --> 12:34.917
I'm Dr. Richard Burke.

12:34.951 --> 12:36.552
FBI Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

12:36.586 --> 12:38.153
This here's my associate,
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

12:38.188 --> 12:40.189
Full Help Wellness is in total
compliance with DC laws.

12:40.223 --> 12:41.824
If you shut us down,
people will suffer.

12:41.858 --> 12:43.325
Okay, just relax, okay?
It's not a raid.

12:43.359 --> 12:45.527
I just have to ask you
a few questions about

12:45.562 --> 12:47.663
one of your employees,
Abby Briggs.

12:47.697 --> 12:49.832
Oh, God...
Her remains were

12:49.866 --> 12:51.867
discovered
in Great Falls National Park.

12:51.901 --> 12:54.903
I kind of figured
this was coming.

12:54.938 --> 12:56.939
What's that?

12:56.973 --> 12:58.173
Well, Abby was very passionate

12:58.208 --> 13:00.209
about the work
that we were doing here.

13:00.243 --> 13:02.010
She wouldn't have just
disappeared without telling us.

13:02.045 --> 13:04.213
Mm-hmm. Your work.

13:04.247 --> 13:06.548
Yes, our work.
I'm a doctor,

13:06.583 --> 13:08.150
not a drug dealer,
Agent Booth.

13:08.184 --> 13:10.586
My only concern here
is helping our patients.

13:10.620 --> 13:12.621
Well, Abby was killed
four months ago.

13:12.655 --> 13:15.891
Was there anyone who came
through here who threatened her?

13:15.925 --> 13:18.694
No, Abby was liked by everyone.

13:18.728 --> 13:21.496
Excuse me, Dr. Burke.
There was that kid.

13:21.531 --> 13:23.365
Kid?
Wait a second. What kid?

13:23.399 --> 13:25.601
From Fulton University.

13:27.704 --> 13:29.371
This is the security footage.

13:29.405 --> 13:32.207
For the safety of employees
and patients,

13:32.242 --> 13:34.610
everything in the dispensary
from seed to sale

13:34.644 --> 13:36.245
is captured on security cameras.

13:36.279 --> 13:38.547
This was taken
the day before Abby disappeared.

13:38.581 --> 13:40.215
Give me my card back.

13:40.250 --> 13:41.717
This is fake,
you know it!

13:41.751 --> 13:43.452
It's not a fake.
I'm sick!

13:43.486 --> 13:45.220
You can get us
shut down!

13:45.255 --> 13:47.489
For God's sakes, who's gonna know?
Get out of here!

13:47.523 --> 13:50.259
Get out of here
before I call the police!

13:50.293 --> 13:51.526
I'm not gonna forget this.

13:51.561 --> 13:53.929
Okay.

13:54.831 --> 13:56.698
You don't remember this?

13:56.733 --> 13:58.867
Uh, I think you
were out that day.

13:58.902 --> 14:02.037
It's possible.
I-I do research as well as sell.

14:02.071 --> 14:03.972
But I've heard of kids
trying to get

14:04.007 --> 14:05.240
in other
dispensaries, too.

14:10.030 --> 14:11.610
<i>I just wanted some weed.</i>

14:11.611 --> 14:12.765
I'm not a killer.

14:12.766 --> 14:14.600
What you did was illegal, Adam.
And I'm sure it wasn't

14:14.635 --> 14:16.035
the only illegal thing
you ever done.

14:16.070 --> 14:17.937
Come on. I made a bogus medical
marijuana card.

14:18.019 --> 14:20.688
It's the same thing as a fake
I.D. for beer, right?

14:20.722 --> 14:21.889
That lady freaked.

14:21.923 --> 14:23.857
That woman has a name,
all right?

14:23.892 --> 14:26.427
It's Abby Briggs and she's dead.
How about a little respect?

14:26.461 --> 14:27.761
I'm sorry.

14:27.796 --> 14:30.998
Look, I don't even smoke
that much.

14:31.032 --> 14:34.868
I swear, I just wanted
a couple joints to celebrate.

14:34.903 --> 14:36.804
Celebrate what?

14:36.838 --> 14:39.707
I just won the Fulton
Emerging Writers Award.

14:39.741 --> 14:41.075
It's a big deal.
Big deal.

14:41.109 --> 14:42.509
And that wasn't
good enough for you?

14:42.544 --> 14:44.812
You needed what,
a little weed

14:44.846 --> 14:46.313
to help you feel
better about yourself?

14:46.348 --> 14:48.015
Look, I'm not
some dumb-ass pothead.

14:48.049 --> 14:50.818
I get really good grades,
I'm on a scholarship...

14:50.852 --> 14:52.486
You're on a scholarship--
exactly.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.321
And if Abby turned you in,
you lose that scholarship

14:54.356 --> 14:55.923
and you get tossed
out of school.

14:55.957 --> 14:57.224
Check my record--

14:57.259 --> 14:59.493
I've never
been in trouble before.

14:59.527 --> 15:01.595
We know that Abby fought
with her killer, right?

15:01.630 --> 15:04.231
We also know that you went
to the Student Health Services

15:04.266 --> 15:06.066
and reported that you had
two bruised ribs

15:06.101 --> 15:07.868
the day after she disappeared.

15:07.902 --> 15:09.670
That's because the rent-a-cop
at the dispensary

15:09.704 --> 15:12.840
whacked me with my flashlight
when he threw me out.

15:12.874 --> 15:15.075
What kind of a writer are you?

15:15.110 --> 15:16.910
Fiction, non-fiction...?

15:16.945 --> 15:18.779
Essays and things like that.

15:18.813 --> 15:20.336
What does that have to do
with anything?

15:20.337 --> 15:21.944
I'm just trying
to figure out how good you are

15:21.945 --> 15:23.479
at making up stories,
that's all.

15:25.020 --> 15:26.420
<i>Look at this.</i>

15:26.454 --> 15:28.622
Termites did a number
on these bones.

15:28.657 --> 15:30.591
Hmm. I checked out
the victim.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.092
She wrote a lot
of articles.

15:32.127 --> 15:33.661
She was pretty passionate
about making sure

15:33.695 --> 15:35.929
people had access
to cannabis.

15:35.964 --> 15:37.931
Yeah? I had that same
passion in college.

15:37.966 --> 15:39.733
I'm serious.
People like her

15:39.768 --> 15:43.404
made sure that people
like me could get help.

15:45.106 --> 15:46.273
You have a card?

15:46.308 --> 15:49.143
I never smoked
before the cancer.

15:49.177 --> 15:51.045
I was strictly a beer guy.

15:51.079 --> 15:53.647
But during the chemo,
my doctor suggested it,

15:53.682 --> 15:56.116
to help with the nausea
and the weight loss.

15:56.151 --> 15:58.352
And? It helped?

15:58.386 --> 16:01.822
Yeah. And early research from Israel
shows that cannabis may

16:01.856 --> 16:04.224
also be effective in
fighting the growth of cancer cells.

16:04.259 --> 16:05.793
Plus, with a 80% mortality rate,

16:05.827 --> 16:07.594
why wouldn't you try
anything that looks promising?

16:07.629 --> 16:10.764
Listen, man, I just want you
to know why I'm doing it,

16:10.799 --> 16:12.966
and I would never do it
when I'm working.

16:13.001 --> 16:15.369
Hey, man, you don't have
to make excuses on my account.

16:15.403 --> 16:17.304
If I were in your shoes,
I'd be doing

16:17.339 --> 16:19.206
the exact same thing.
It's for you.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.574
Thanks.

16:20.608 --> 16:22.409
Maybe we could keep
this between us?

16:22.444 --> 16:26.814
Of course, sure, but, buddy, no one is
gonna judge you for that.

16:26.848 --> 16:28.482
Especially not here.

16:29.584 --> 16:31.251
Oh, whuh-oh!

16:31.286 --> 16:33.354
It looks like I'm taking
one of your friends.

16:33.388 --> 16:35.322
What is he doing here?

16:35.357 --> 16:38.258
That's <i>Dendroctonus frontalis,</i>
it's a southern pine beetle.

16:38.293 --> 16:40.861
Okay.
It's just that the log

16:40.895 --> 16:43.230
and all the trees
around it are white oaks.

16:43.264 --> 16:46.834
This little guy got introduced
to the log from someplace else.

16:57.779 --> 17:00.013
Hey, how'd it go
with the college kid?

17:00.048 --> 17:02.082
Not sure. He's pretty dumb
for a smart kid.

17:02.117 --> 17:03.817
I'm gonna keep
an eye on him.

17:03.852 --> 17:05.551
Oh! Stupid game.

17:05.587 --> 17:06.854
What are you doing?

17:06.887 --> 17:08.689
Ah, some critical thinking game

17:08.723 --> 17:10.324
that Bones keeps talking about.

17:10.358 --> 17:11.992
To improve your test score?

17:12.026 --> 17:13.694
This is fine for the squints,

17:13.728 --> 17:15.863
but for me, you know what?
I'm in the 90th percentile,

17:15.896 --> 17:18.999
so, you know, if it ain't broke,
then you know what I mean?

17:19.032 --> 17:20.701
Yes, I do.

17:20.734 --> 17:22.536
Good. You know what?
Glad you agree.

17:22.569 --> 17:23.936
I just said I know
what you mean.

17:23.972 --> 17:25.539
This is the victim's
sketch book.

17:25.573 --> 17:28.609
She was able to draw again
when she started medicating.

17:30.078 --> 17:31.879
Wow, she was good.
Yeah, very.

17:31.913 --> 17:33.580
In my clinical training,

17:33.615 --> 17:35.416
we used subjects' artwork

17:35.450 --> 17:37.718
as a sort of window
into their subconscious.

17:37.752 --> 17:38.919
Look at, look at this one.

17:40.822 --> 17:43.323
Wait a second.
That's the security guard.

17:43.358 --> 17:44.925
Notice how
he's staring at her.

17:44.959 --> 17:47.761
He's ogling her
in every image of him.

17:47.796 --> 17:49.763
And there are a lot.

17:49.798 --> 17:51.832
No matter what's going on
around him, he's always

17:51.866 --> 17:53.901
staring at her.
He wanted her.

17:53.935 --> 17:55.689
And notice how far away

17:55.714 --> 17:58.087
she places herself from him
in every picture.

17:58.206 --> 17:59.706
He's in love with Abby,

17:59.741 --> 18:02.042
and she didn't want anything
to do with him.

18:02.076 --> 18:04.478
Maybe he couldn't take no
for an answer.

18:04.512 --> 18:06.113
It's a logical conclusion.

18:06.147 --> 18:08.549
I got that with
no computer game, hmm?

18:08.583 --> 18:10.317
Hey.
How about that?

18:12.487 --> 18:14.455
These are the last
of the bone fragments

18:14.489 --> 18:16.290
that Hodgins found
in the log.

18:16.324 --> 18:17.724
Very good, Mr. Bray.

18:17.759 --> 18:19.793
Your work on this case
has been excellent.

18:19.828 --> 18:22.229
Thank you.

18:22.263 --> 18:24.965
How are your side-effects
from chemotherapy?

18:24.999 --> 18:26.099
They've been pretty severe.

18:26.134 --> 18:28.368
I was given metoclopramide

18:28.403 --> 18:31.538
and granisetron, but the expense
and the side-effects,

18:31.573 --> 18:33.907
they-they aren't agreeing
with me.

18:33.942 --> 18:37.578
There appears to be evidence
of blunt-force trauma

18:37.612 --> 18:40.614
to the ascending ramus
of the right mandible.

18:40.648 --> 18:43.484
The depressed collinear
fracture's consistent

18:43.518 --> 18:46.320
with an impact from
a curved blunt object.

18:46.354 --> 18:47.554
Hmm.

18:47.589 --> 18:49.623
Perhaps you should try cannabis.

18:52.660 --> 18:55.462
I'll be fine.

18:55.497 --> 18:58.432
I would never recommend
ingesting it recreationally,

18:58.466 --> 19:00.734
because it's illegal,
but medicinally,

19:00.768 --> 19:02.970
if the pharmaceuticals
are problematic,

19:03.004 --> 19:04.371
I would definitely try it.

19:04.405 --> 19:06.473
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

19:06.508 --> 19:09.176
Didn't Booth say
that the college kid accused

19:09.210 --> 19:11.144
the security guard of hitting
him with a flashlight?

19:11.179 --> 19:12.546
Yes.

19:12.580 --> 19:14.181
Well, the curved handle
of the heavy flashlight

19:14.215 --> 19:16.517
could have certainly caused
this fracture to the mandible.

19:20.021 --> 19:22.213
You think I killed her
with my flashlight?!

19:22.238 --> 19:22.823
This is crazy!

19:22.824 --> 19:24.525
Crazy? I don't know.
What was it, Carl,

19:24.559 --> 19:26.827
was it one of those, "If I can't
have her, no one can"?

19:26.861 --> 19:28.328
No!
No?

19:28.363 --> 19:31.031
Look, she was friendly to me
for a long time,

19:31.065 --> 19:32.533
so I got the signals mixed up.

19:32.567 --> 19:34.501
But then she changed.

19:34.536 --> 19:37.204
She started acting secretive
at work whenever she saw me.

19:37.238 --> 19:38.672
So I backed off.

19:38.706 --> 19:40.007
What do you mean by secretive?

19:40.041 --> 19:41.842
Like, she'd be talking
with a patient,

19:41.876 --> 19:43.544
and I'd walk in the room,
and they'd both stop talking.

19:43.578 --> 19:45.078
Maybe you creeped her out.

19:45.113 --> 19:46.880
Maybe.

19:46.915 --> 19:48.482
You hear what
they were talking about?

19:48.516 --> 19:50.083
No. Like I said,
she would just clam up

19:50.118 --> 19:51.785
and stare at me when
I walked in.

19:51.819 --> 19:54.221
Awfully convenient of you
to bring all this up now.

19:54.255 --> 19:56.857
I need your flashlight
to compare to injuries on Abby.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.592
Oh.

19:58.626 --> 19:59.726
"Oh," what?

19:59.761 --> 20:01.862
I don't have that one anymore.

20:01.896 --> 20:04.097
The one I had when
Abby was still there.

20:04.132 --> 20:06.600
Why does that not surprise me?

20:11.434 --> 20:13.235
While this isn't
the guard's flashlight,

20:13.269 --> 20:16.538
it is the same make and model
we saw him carrying

20:16.573 --> 20:17.940
on the security video.

20:17.974 --> 20:19.508
The fracture lines are
consistent with a blow

20:19.542 --> 20:20.976
from a flashlight
this heavy.

20:21.011 --> 20:25.147
However, the dimensions
of the fracture

20:25.181 --> 20:27.549
are too narrow to have
been created by this model.

20:27.584 --> 20:28.984
So it wasn't the guard.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.786
All we've determined

20:30.820 --> 20:32.755
is that it's not
his flashlight.

20:32.789 --> 20:34.723
Booth still feels that
he's a viable suspect,

20:34.758 --> 20:36.425
so he could have
used another weapon.

20:36.459 --> 20:40.362
Dr. Brennan,
I-I can't lie to you.

20:40.397 --> 20:42.164
Why would you have to?

20:42.198 --> 20:44.633
I have been using cannabis.

20:44.667 --> 20:47.136
Why would you lie about that?

20:47.170 --> 20:49.304
Because I didn't
want you to think

20:49.339 --> 20:51.040
that it would compromise
my performance.

20:51.074 --> 20:53.175
I-I would never use it at work.

20:53.209 --> 20:55.577
Mr. Bray, we're scientists.

20:55.612 --> 20:58.680
Hopefully,
we're not ruled by hysteria,

20:58.715 --> 21:00.649
fueled by ignorance.

21:00.683 --> 21:02.851
You're fighting for your life.

21:02.886 --> 21:05.421
Yeah, but while I'm here,

21:05.455 --> 21:07.890
I want you to think
that I'm living it well.

21:07.924 --> 21:09.258
I do.

21:09.292 --> 21:10.759
As a matter of fact,

21:10.794 --> 21:14.063
I think that you're
an example to us all.

21:16.132 --> 21:17.933
Is there anything else?

21:17.967 --> 21:20.569
No.

21:20.603 --> 21:23.205
Then I noticed a fracture
to the superior aspect

21:23.239 --> 21:24.506
of the left clavicle.

21:24.541 --> 21:27.876
Oh, the termites had
a feast with that one.

21:27.911 --> 21:30.546
There appears to be
a V-shaped cleft.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.348
The angle of the wound
track is too wide to have

21:33.383 --> 21:36.218
been caused by a blade
and too narrow to have been

21:36.252 --> 21:38.153
created by the weapon
that fractured the mandible.

21:38.188 --> 21:40.789
So we're looking for a weapon
that's both curved and blunt,

21:40.824 --> 21:43.225
but also has sharp corners.

21:43.259 --> 21:45.461
Unless the killer used
multiple weapons.

21:45.495 --> 21:47.729
Or we're dealing with
multiple killers.

21:53.536 --> 21:55.337
What, did you call down here
just to impress me?

21:55.371 --> 21:58.607
No. But now you know how
I get ready for a test.

21:58.641 --> 22:00.476
Especially since
you won't help me.

22:00.510 --> 22:01.810
I'm sorry for
having scruples.

22:01.845 --> 22:03.579
All right,
well, anyways,

22:03.613 --> 22:06.215
I went through Abby's
credit card statements.

22:06.249 --> 22:07.516
Three months before
she was murdered...

22:07.550 --> 22:08.817
Mm-hmm?

22:08.852 --> 22:10.185
...she was buying
camping equipment.

22:10.220 --> 22:12.187
No. Based on what
we know about her,

22:12.222 --> 22:14.356
she wasn't an outdoorsy type.

22:14.390 --> 22:16.658
Why is she spending money
on tents and hotplates

22:16.693 --> 22:18.393
when she doesn't even have
any money to begin with?

22:18.428 --> 22:21.697
Maybe she was combating issues
of self-reliance, right?

22:21.731 --> 22:23.365
'Cause of the lupus?
Maybe she felt

22:23.399 --> 22:24.800
she needed to prove to herself

22:24.834 --> 22:27.035
that she could still
survive on her own.

22:27.070 --> 22:28.971
Right. And what better
place to do that

22:29.005 --> 22:30.405
than good old
Mother Nature?

22:30.440 --> 22:32.508
Come on, let's go. Oh.

22:32.542 --> 22:33.742
What?
This is a cognitive

22:33.776 --> 22:34.910
exercise board

22:34.944 --> 22:36.578
for abstract thinking.
Yeah, I know.

22:36.613 --> 22:39.481
Bones, she just put
that in my bag, you know?

22:39.516 --> 22:41.316
It's not like I'm using it
or anything like that.

22:41.351 --> 22:43.619
Come on, just shut your mouth,
let's go to work, okay?

22:43.653 --> 22:44.786
Come on. Let's go.

22:53.229 --> 22:54.630
Hey, Dr. Saroyan,
do you have a minute?

22:54.664 --> 22:55.898
Of course.

22:55.932 --> 22:57.266
Have you found something?

22:57.300 --> 22:59.334
Oh, uh, yes, Dr. Brennan
and I found evidence

22:59.369 --> 23:01.570
to suggest there may have been
more than one assailant.

23:01.604 --> 23:03.939
Thanks.
I will pass that along to Booth.

23:05.808 --> 23:07.709
Okay...

23:07.744 --> 23:09.745
I'm sorry, was there
something else?

23:09.779 --> 23:12.648
Yes, I, uh...

23:12.682 --> 23:14.116
had a talk with Dr. Brennan

23:14.150 --> 23:17.152
and I thought I
should tell you...

23:18.588 --> 23:20.422
I've been using cannabis

23:20.456 --> 23:22.090
to help with my chemo.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.726
Oh.

23:24.761 --> 23:26.228
Okay.
Legally,

23:26.262 --> 23:28.397
of course. I'm not going
into any dark alleys

23:28.431 --> 23:29.731
or anything like that.
Oh...

23:29.766 --> 23:31.500
I understand.

23:31.534 --> 23:34.436
Uh, do you find that it's,
uh, been working for you?

23:34.470 --> 23:37.039
Uh, chemo is still tough,

23:37.073 --> 23:39.975
but, uh...
it helps, very much so.

23:40.009 --> 23:42.277
Then I would feel horrible

23:42.312 --> 23:43.779
asking you to stop.

23:43.813 --> 23:45.781
You want me to stop?

23:45.815 --> 23:48.383
No, I...

23:48.418 --> 23:50.519
This is a federal institution,
Mr. Bray.

23:50.553 --> 23:52.154
And federally,

23:52.188 --> 23:53.956
there's no such thing
as legal marijuana use.

23:53.990 --> 23:56.558
Well, yeah, I'm...
I'm not using it at work.

23:56.593 --> 23:58.360
Well, it doesn't matter.
In the eyes of the law,

23:58.394 --> 23:59.962
your use of a
Schedule One drug

23:59.996 --> 24:01.296
could call into question

24:01.331 --> 24:03.332
every piece of
evidence you handle.

24:03.366 --> 24:05.267
Even if we did catch the killer,

24:05.301 --> 24:07.135
he could walk because of you.

24:07.170 --> 24:09.938
What are you...
what are you saying?

24:11.808 --> 24:13.775
I'm saying...

24:15.745 --> 24:17.980
...that as long as you're
using marijuana,

24:18.014 --> 24:21.516
I-I can't allow you
to work here.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.653
You're firing me?

24:26.289 --> 24:27.422
There are rules

24:27.457 --> 24:28.890
that I have to
follow, Mr. Bray,

24:28.925 --> 24:31.126
as much as
I hate them.

24:32.328 --> 24:34.229
I understand.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.498
I'm really, really glad

24:36.532 --> 24:39.001
that this treatment
is working for you.

24:39.035 --> 24:41.370
I-I... I appreciate that.

24:41.404 --> 24:43.939
And, uh... I'm sorry
I put you in...

24:43.973 --> 24:45.207
in an awkward position.

24:45.241 --> 24:46.575
I'll go gather my things.

24:48.544 --> 24:51.146
I... uh... Mr. Bray...

24:55.585 --> 24:57.519
I'm sorry.

25:13.870 --> 25:15.203
<i>I cannot believe</i>

25:15.238 --> 25:16.605
that Cam fired him!

25:16.639 --> 25:17.673
Who fires somebody
with cancer?

25:17.707 --> 25:19.207
This is my fault.

25:19.242 --> 25:21.276
I told him that no one
here was gonna judge him.

25:21.311 --> 25:24.012
It's not your fault, honey.
It's Cam's.

25:24.047 --> 25:25.848
She said herself that
he was doing great work.

25:25.882 --> 25:27.616
Yeah? Well, maybe
I should tell Cam

25:27.650 --> 25:29.151
that if Wendell's gone,
I'm gone, too.

25:29.185 --> 25:31.853
Except you know that
Wendell would not want that.

25:31.888 --> 25:34.389
This totally sucks.

25:34.424 --> 25:36.291
You guys wanted
to see me?

25:38.094 --> 25:40.729
I know, I know...

25:40.763 --> 25:42.197
He needs this job, Cam.

25:42.231 --> 25:43.699
With what he's going through,

25:43.733 --> 25:45.767
he-he needs to be
a part of something.

25:45.802 --> 25:47.169
He needs a family.

25:47.203 --> 25:48.470
Thank you, Dr. Hodgins,

25:48.504 --> 25:49.905
because I didn't
feel bad enough.

25:49.939 --> 25:50.939
Then why can't you just tell...

25:50.973 --> 25:52.808
You know why.

25:52.842 --> 25:54.876
I mean, you guys are looking
for a villain in all this

25:54.911 --> 25:56.778
and you've
settled on me,

25:56.813 --> 25:58.146
and if that makes you
feel better, fine.

25:58.181 --> 26:01.583
But hate me
while we work on this case.

26:05.121 --> 26:07.622
Angie, do you mind
calling up a satellite image

26:07.657 --> 26:10.258
of Great Falls
National Park?

26:12.328 --> 26:14.363
So the X is where
the body was found.

26:14.397 --> 26:17.999
All right, we need to find
a grove of <i>Pinus virginiana,</i>

26:18.034 --> 26:19.801
or Virginia Pine.

26:19.836 --> 26:22.971
It-it's got to be where the
southern pine beetle came from.

26:23.005 --> 26:24.673
Well, how do I do that?

26:24.707 --> 26:26.875
There should be one northeast
of where the dump site was.

26:26.909 --> 26:30.846
Just look for a patch of
yellowish vegetation.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.447
Okay. Got it.

26:32.482 --> 26:33.715
And the pollen I found?

26:33.750 --> 26:35.751
<i>Cirsium vulgare.</i>

26:35.785 --> 26:37.119
It's-it's spear thistle.

26:37.153 --> 26:39.254
It's got to be near
a body of water.

26:39.288 --> 26:41.390
Well, this stream is
the only water source.

26:41.424 --> 26:43.792
All right, we're looking
for a purple flower, then.

26:43.826 --> 26:45.093
The pollen from that
was the last thing

26:45.128 --> 26:46.628
she inhaled
before she died.

26:48.698 --> 26:49.931
Yeah. Good. Bingo.

26:49.966 --> 26:51.933
You found the murder site.

26:51.968 --> 26:54.102
Yeah, great.

27:02.779 --> 27:04.780
Well, it was definitely
Abby's campsite.

27:04.814 --> 27:05.914
Look at that.

27:05.948 --> 27:07.215
We, if she was
killed here,

27:07.250 --> 27:09.584
we might be able
to find some blood.

27:09.619 --> 27:11.853
Look, you think that
I should call Wendell?

27:11.888 --> 27:13.121
Do you find that

27:13.156 --> 27:14.489
his getting fired

27:14.524 --> 27:16.691
changes your stance
on medicinal marijuana?

27:16.726 --> 27:18.193
Come on,
I don't have that luxury.

27:18.227 --> 27:19.728
The law is the law.

27:19.762 --> 27:21.129
- You know that, Bones.
- Well, in Virginia,

27:21.164 --> 27:22.697
it's illegal for children

27:22.732 --> 27:24.065
to trick-or-treat on Halloween.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.535
Premarital sex is
also illegal there.

27:26.569 --> 27:29.072
We had sex before we were
married in Virginia.

27:29.073 --> 27:31.748
Wait a second. That's different.
Everybody has sex.

27:33.075 --> 27:35.877
- Well, there's blood, Booth.
- Blood?

27:35.912 --> 27:38.380
Yeah. That's not
all we've got.

27:43.152 --> 27:45.821
Oh!

27:45.855 --> 27:48.757
- Abby was growing marijuana?
- Hah!

27:48.791 --> 27:51.626
Looks like about half the
plants have been taken, too.

27:51.661 --> 27:53.628
I mean, you think the weed
is what got her killed?

27:53.663 --> 27:55.430
Well, if this was
all about the weed,

27:55.465 --> 27:57.466
then why'd the killer
just take half?

28:05.191 --> 28:06.658
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:06.692 --> 28:08.660
Thanks for meeting me.
Yeah.

28:08.694 --> 28:11.129
Listen, uh, sorry about
what happened today.

28:11.164 --> 28:13.131
Yeah, yeah. Me, too.
How's the case coming?

28:13.166 --> 28:15.200
Oh, you know. One step forward,
two steps back.

28:15.234 --> 28:16.968
Just trying to figure out
why she would grow

28:17.003 --> 28:18.203
her own weed,
you know, illegally.

28:18.237 --> 28:19.437
You'll do it.
You always do.

28:19.472 --> 28:20.605
All right. Coffee.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.207
- Yeah.
- Coming up.

28:22.241 --> 28:24.276
But that's not why
we're meeting, huh?

28:24.310 --> 28:26.778
I do miss helping
with the case.

28:26.813 --> 28:29.247
But, uh... no.

28:29.282 --> 28:31.116
I was just wondering...

28:31.150 --> 28:33.185
you would've done the
same thing, wouldn't you?

28:33.219 --> 28:35.720
You know, Cam really didn't
really have a choice.

28:35.755 --> 28:37.656
Neither would I.
Yeah, I get that, but...

28:37.690 --> 28:40.392
just... it makes no sense
that I'm being punished.

28:40.426 --> 28:42.460
I'm just fighting the cancer
any way that I can,

28:42.495 --> 28:44.596
just like you told me to.

28:46.799 --> 28:48.567
No, look, I understand that,

28:48.601 --> 28:51.203
but Wendell, I, you know...
I work in the law. Okay?

28:51.237 --> 28:52.871
I'm a law-abiding citizen,
I always have been.

28:52.905 --> 28:55.440
I've never even
touched the stuff.

28:55.474 --> 28:56.675
Hey, I-I respect that.

28:56.709 --> 28:58.210
I really do. I...

28:58.244 --> 29:00.412
I didn't come here to
make you feel guilty...

29:06.319 --> 29:08.753
I just wanted you to know
that I'm not a loser.

29:12.191 --> 29:14.459
I would never think
that you're a loser.

29:14.493 --> 29:16.194
What you're dealing with, and...

29:16.229 --> 29:19.264
Forget that I'm an agent
right now, all right?

29:19.298 --> 29:20.732
I'm your friend.

29:20.766 --> 29:23.268
And you shouldn't have
been punished for it.

29:23.302 --> 29:25.403
Yeah.

29:26.672 --> 29:27.973
Thanks, man, that...

29:28.007 --> 29:30.242
that means a lot,
coming from you.

29:34.881 --> 29:37.048
I couldn't figure out why Abby
was growing her own pot.

29:37.083 --> 29:39.384
I mean, she had a whole dispensary
to take advantage of.

29:39.418 --> 29:41.219
So I analyzed the
remaining plants

29:41.254 --> 29:42.487
we found in the woods.

29:42.521 --> 29:44.322
Well, she was
very knowledgeable.

29:44.357 --> 29:46.024
I imagine her plants
were of high quality.

29:46.058 --> 29:47.692
They were, but not in
the way you'd imagine.

29:47.727 --> 29:50.462
So the Tetrahydrocannabinol
content in her strain

29:50.496 --> 29:52.197
was only four percent.

29:52.231 --> 29:53.665
That's
extremely low.

29:53.699 --> 29:55.100
It would barely have
any psychoactive effect.

29:55.134 --> 29:56.601
And check this out.

29:56.636 --> 29:59.304
So the strain tested through
the roof for cannabidiol.

29:59.338 --> 30:00.906
CBDs.

30:00.940 --> 30:03.675
CBDs account for the medicinal
effects of marijuana.

30:03.709 --> 30:05.844
Exactly.
It's perfect for use as a...

30:05.878 --> 30:07.746
as an anti-inflammatory,

30:07.780 --> 30:09.581
uh, anti-nausea medicine,

30:09.615 --> 30:11.116
for seizures, glaucoma...

30:11.150 --> 30:12.250
It would give relief to patients

30:12.285 --> 30:14.219
without getting them
intoxicated.

30:14.253 --> 30:16.655
But that wouldn't have been
a big seller at the dispensary.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.990
But Abby wasn't in it
for the money.

30:19.025 --> 30:22.327
So after searching through
five mind-numbing days

30:22.361 --> 30:24.362
of dispensary footage,

30:24.397 --> 30:27.032
I think I might have
found something.

30:31.771 --> 30:33.705
Huh? Did you catch it?

30:33.739 --> 30:35.273
The handshake.

30:35.308 --> 30:37.575
She only shook hands
with every few patients.

30:37.610 --> 30:39.711
And Abby always
initiated it.

30:39.745 --> 30:41.980
Here are a few others.

30:50.389 --> 30:51.589
Okay...

30:51.624 --> 30:53.091
so she's very friendly.

30:53.125 --> 30:54.359
Maybe these are
her favorite people.

30:54.393 --> 30:55.660
Could be.

30:55.695 --> 30:58.129
But look what she's
got in her hand.

31:02.068 --> 31:03.401
Abby was dealing
her own pot

31:03.436 --> 31:05.170
out of the dispensary?

31:06.906 --> 31:09.007
<i>You gave up a lot</i>
<i>to open up your dispensary,</i>

31:09.041 --> 31:10.175
didn't you, Dr. Burke?

31:10.209 --> 31:12.310
Even closed your
medical practice.

31:12.345 --> 31:13.845
I didn't feel as if
I was giving up anything.

31:13.879 --> 31:15.046
I'm still doing research

31:15.081 --> 31:16.448
and I'm still
helping patients.

31:16.482 --> 31:18.450
But if somebody
jeopardized your operation,

31:18.484 --> 31:19.784
you'd lose everything.

31:19.819 --> 31:21.853
I can imagine that would
make you very angry.

31:21.887 --> 31:23.288
What are you getting at?

31:23.322 --> 31:24.689
We have evidence

31:24.724 --> 31:26.925
that Abby sold pot
out of your shop.

31:26.959 --> 31:28.693
Okay, that's ridiculous.

31:28.728 --> 31:30.195
We have the best medicine.
Abby knew that.

31:30.229 --> 31:32.530
There'd be no need for her to.

31:32.565 --> 31:34.532
But you don't have the strain
that Abby was selling.

31:34.567 --> 31:35.800
High in cannabidiol,

31:35.835 --> 31:37.168
low in THC.

31:37.203 --> 31:38.870
I see where
you're going with this.

31:38.904 --> 31:41.573
But only licensed growers
can supply your dispensary.

31:41.607 --> 31:42.907
And none of them grow the strain

31:42.942 --> 31:44.476
high in cannabidiol.

31:44.510 --> 31:46.244
Which is what I told her
when she asked about the strain.

31:46.278 --> 31:47.379
So you warned her.

31:47.413 --> 31:48.446
Yes.

31:48.481 --> 31:49.881
Right.

31:49.915 --> 31:51.383
But... not that way.

31:51.417 --> 31:52.817
You could have lost

31:52.852 --> 31:54.419
everything you'd worked
for because of Abby.

31:54.453 --> 31:55.754
You know what
I think happened?

31:55.788 --> 31:57.322
I think you went
out to talk to her.

31:57.356 --> 31:58.990
You followed her
out to her grow, right?

31:59.025 --> 32:00.492
You're out in the
middle of nowhere,

32:00.526 --> 32:01.993
things got out of hand...
No.

32:02.028 --> 32:04.029
So you killed her
to save your business.

32:04.063 --> 32:05.563
You know, I've tried to help.

32:05.598 --> 32:07.499
The Feds always try
to demonize us.

32:07.533 --> 32:10.402
I'm not saying another word
without my lawyer.

32:17.043 --> 32:20.445
I was looking through
the crime scene photos...

32:21.847 --> 32:24.049
We found the
victim's blood

32:24.083 --> 32:27.318
on numerous trees,
rocks, bushes...

32:27.353 --> 32:28.720
This is a high-velocity
blood spatter.

32:28.754 --> 32:30.321
Which means it's arterial.

32:30.356 --> 32:31.723
Well, the amount
of blood expelled

32:31.757 --> 32:33.992
is consistent with
a sliced carotid.

32:38.064 --> 32:40.899
I can call in another intern
to help you, if you'd like.

32:40.933 --> 32:43.168
Unless that intern
is Mr. Bray, I'm fine.

32:44.570 --> 32:46.271
I thought you, of all people,
would understand.

32:46.305 --> 32:47.806
I made the logical call,
Dr. Brennan.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.674
You're asking him to choose

32:49.708 --> 32:51.443
between his job and his health.

32:51.477 --> 32:53.111
I did what's best
for this institution

32:53.145 --> 32:54.946
and you're not gonna
convince me otherwise.

32:54.980 --> 32:56.381
You were right.

32:56.415 --> 32:57.982
I know.

32:58.017 --> 32:59.584
Thank you for finally realizing.

32:59.618 --> 33:01.519
I meant regarding the carotid.

33:01.554 --> 33:03.288
There's a slight incision

33:03.322 --> 33:07.659
on the right greater cornu
of the hyoid.

33:07.693 --> 33:09.594
And whatever
caused this wound

33:09.628 --> 33:12.430
would've had to first transect
the right external carotid.

33:12.465 --> 33:13.932
The cut appears
to be very clean,

33:13.966 --> 33:14.966
very precise.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.201
Not at all

33:16.235 --> 33:17.769
like the messy injuries
surrounding it.

33:17.803 --> 33:19.504
It's as if the killer
knew exactly

33:19.538 --> 33:23.141
where and how to deliver
a quick fatal cut.

33:23.175 --> 33:25.076
Sounds like the work
of a doctor.

33:31.114 --> 33:32.415
The week of the murder,
the doctor was speaking

33:32.449 --> 33:35.785
at a conference on
marijuana policy reform.

33:35.819 --> 33:39.755
So, you know, his lawyer had
travel receipts and witnesses.

33:39.790 --> 33:42.525
I'll go through all the evidence
at the lab again.

33:42.559 --> 33:44.994
Must be tough without Wendell.

33:46.663 --> 33:48.664
He was a great help.

33:50.167 --> 33:52.201
I think it was wrong,
just so you know.

33:52.235 --> 33:54.770
I mean, he put a face
on it for me.

33:54.805 --> 33:57.440
You took an oath.

33:57.474 --> 33:59.341
I'm sorry if I implied
you were stubborn.

33:59.376 --> 34:01.710
That's okay, it's just
sometimes I can just be,

34:01.745 --> 34:03.679
you know what,
determined, that's all.

34:03.713 --> 34:05.748
And I shouldn't have pushed you
about your test.

34:05.782 --> 34:07.249
You're a great agent.

34:07.284 --> 34:09.752
I never meant to imply...

34:09.786 --> 34:11.620
It's okay, you know?

34:11.655 --> 34:13.222
I've been doing the exercises.

34:13.255 --> 34:14.523
I mean, even that stupid book.

34:14.558 --> 34:16.025
Oh.
Yeah, but I'm not

34:16.059 --> 34:17.092
gonna need it
after I do the test.

34:17.127 --> 34:18.226
Maybe I'll just burn it.

34:18.261 --> 34:20.262
You know?
Sorry to interrupt.

34:20.297 --> 34:21.864
Hey, Wendell, have a seat.

34:21.898 --> 34:23.165
Ah, that's okay, this'll
just take a second.

34:23.199 --> 34:24.400
Cam told me I could
find you here.

34:24.434 --> 34:25.835
Is everything okay?

34:25.869 --> 34:27.268
Yeah, yeah, it's just
when I handed

34:27.304 --> 34:28.670
over my badge and stuff,

34:28.705 --> 34:31.873
I forgot
to give you my case notes.

34:33.143 --> 34:37.079
I'll miss you
in the lab, Mr. Bray.

34:37.114 --> 34:39.047
You're still coming by

34:39.081 --> 34:40.116
this weekend
for the game, right?

34:40.150 --> 34:41.117
Yeah, of course.

34:41.150 --> 34:42.284
I'll bring brownies.

34:42.319 --> 34:44.420
My dispensary has
a great recipe.

34:46.623 --> 34:48.224
Just kidding.

34:48.257 --> 34:49.592
I have a doctor's appointment.

34:49.626 --> 34:52.128
I'll let you guys
get back to it.

34:55.831 --> 34:57.399
There's got to be something
we can do for him, right?

34:57.434 --> 34:59.702
Oh, he found a microscopic,
cross-shaped puncture

34:59.736 --> 35:02.037
along the curvilinear fracture
to the mandible.

35:02.072 --> 35:05.307
I have no idea what that means,
but I hope it's good.

35:05.342 --> 35:07.109
Because of Mr. Bray's notes,

35:07.144 --> 35:09.678
we can add the cross-shaped
puncture wound

35:09.713 --> 35:11.413
to the trauma on the mandible.

35:11.448 --> 35:14.283
Which suggests it was created by
the point of a triangular tool.

35:14.317 --> 35:16.652
Ah, great. I'll add that
to the ever-growing list

35:16.686 --> 35:18.287
of murder weapons which
we cannot identify.

35:18.321 --> 35:21.457
The location of the
puncture suggests

35:21.491 --> 35:23.692
one strike from one weapon.

35:23.727 --> 35:26.028
A weapon that's circular,

35:26.062 --> 35:28.097
triangular, blunt and

35:28.131 --> 35:30.666
sharp enough to slice
the victim's throat.

35:30.700 --> 35:32.168
That's a tall order.

35:32.202 --> 35:34.136
I'll feed all the images
into the search to see

35:34.171 --> 35:35.471
if we get any hits.

35:36.506 --> 35:37.773
Hmm!

35:37.807 --> 35:40.476
Did Salvador Dali
ever design a weapon?

35:40.510 --> 35:44.113
Place the sphere
on top of the pyramid.

35:44.147 --> 35:46.315
Right, 'cause this
can't get any weirder.

35:46.349 --> 35:48.617
I believe

35:48.652 --> 35:52.154
the victim was first struck
in a downward motion

35:52.189 --> 35:54.790
with the circular part
of the weapon,

35:54.824 --> 35:57.426
creating the fracture
to the right-side mandible.

35:57.460 --> 36:00.029
That portion
of the weapon broke off,

36:00.063 --> 36:01.397
exposing the triangular

36:01.431 --> 36:02.932
aspect underneath.

36:02.966 --> 36:05.801
Right, which created the
puncture mark next to the break.

36:05.835 --> 36:08.470
And the point of the triangle
then continued downward,

36:08.505 --> 36:09.872
transecting the carotid.

36:09.906 --> 36:11.840
Before ultimately
coming into contact

36:11.875 --> 36:14.076
with the left-side clavicle
and creating

36:14.110 --> 36:15.544
the V-shaped cleft.

36:15.579 --> 36:17.580
Huh. It all lines up.

36:17.614 --> 36:19.014
This is the only object

36:19.049 --> 36:21.116
that makes sense,
based on the injuries.

36:21.151 --> 36:23.919
So we have
an unrecognizable weapon

36:23.954 --> 36:25.354
with a bizarre shape.

36:25.388 --> 36:27.022
And no matches.

36:30.627 --> 36:31.927
Oh.

36:31.962 --> 36:33.896
Looks like our murder
weapon was a trophy.

36:33.930 --> 36:35.231
"Fulton University

36:35.265 --> 36:37.032
Emerging Writers Award."

36:39.236 --> 36:40.803
Can you

36:40.837 --> 36:42.071
enlarge this photo?

36:50.680 --> 36:53.882
So, after using the trophy
as a murder weapon,

36:53.917 --> 36:57.353
you wiped off the blood and you
gave it back to your parents?

36:57.387 --> 36:58.887
They must have
been very proud.

36:58.922 --> 37:02.157
Until we seized the award
and arrested you for murder.

37:02.192 --> 37:04.193
- Why would I kill her?
- Why? Because

37:04.227 --> 37:06.729
you're a drug dealer on campus.
Plus, she cut off your supply

37:06.763 --> 37:08.230
at her dispensary.

37:08.265 --> 37:09.832
That is crazy.

37:09.866 --> 37:11.810
I'm a good student.
I'm here to study.

37:11.835 --> 37:12.301
Right.

37:12.302 --> 37:13.982
Well, we talked
to some of your classmates.

37:14.004 --> 37:15.938
They said, four months ago,
you sold pot

37:15.972 --> 37:18.841
to some of your customers,
and it didn't get them high.

37:18.875 --> 37:20.709
Because her plants
were truly medicinal.

37:20.744 --> 37:22.945
That's why you didn't go back
for the rest of her grow.

37:22.979 --> 37:25.714
You have no proof of this.

37:25.749 --> 37:28.751
Yes, we do.

37:28.785 --> 37:31.086
It's blood, Booth.

37:31.121 --> 37:32.955
You had just won
the award that day,

37:32.989 --> 37:34.723
and you had it in your backpack

37:34.758 --> 37:36.191
when you went out
to confront her.

37:36.226 --> 37:38.227
If she'd just sold to me
at the dispensary...

37:38.261 --> 37:40.996
That's for people who need it,
people who are sick.

37:42.932 --> 37:44.633
I didn't mean for her to die.

37:44.668 --> 37:48.570
I... I just wanted
to knock her out.

38:26.309 --> 38:27.710
Oh. Hey.

38:27.744 --> 38:29.611
Am I getting evicted now, too?

38:29.646 --> 38:31.146
I'm not sure
what your lease says.

38:31.181 --> 38:32.548
Bones.

38:32.582 --> 38:35.117
Come-come on in, guys.
- Let's go.

38:35.151 --> 38:38.053
Just so you know, I was messy
before I started smoking.

38:38.088 --> 38:40.489
Right. Well, we just spoke

38:40.523 --> 38:42.424
to Caroline
at the Justice Department.

38:42.459 --> 38:43.992
You-you shouldn't
have done that, man.

38:44.027 --> 38:45.794
I don't want to get anybody else
in trouble.

38:45.829 --> 38:47.296
She said that Cam was right

38:47.330 --> 38:48.964
to let you go as an employee
of the Jeffersonian.

38:48.998 --> 38:50.165
And I already told her
that I understood that.

38:50.200 --> 38:51.467
Yeah, but, when pressed,

38:51.501 --> 38:53.268
Caroline said
that Cam can rehire you

38:53.303 --> 38:55.637
as a freelance
case consultant.

38:55.672 --> 38:57.473
Okay, now I don't think
I understand.

38:57.507 --> 38:59.508
Caroline said
that as long

38:59.542 --> 39:01.944
as you have no physical contact
with evidence

39:01.978 --> 39:03.078
and are paid

39:03.113 --> 39:04.646
as an independent
contractor,

39:04.681 --> 39:06.849
we can continue
working together.

39:06.883 --> 39:09.551
And I don't have
to stop my treatment?

39:09.586 --> 39:11.086
No.

39:14.023 --> 39:15.891
You did this for me?

39:15.925 --> 39:17.426
I'd do anything for my friend,

39:17.460 --> 39:20.429
especially if it's gonna
get you better.

39:21.531 --> 39:23.465
Thank you.

39:23.500 --> 39:24.933
Hey, and now, guess what?

39:24.968 --> 39:27.169
You get a, uh,
consultant's office.

39:27.203 --> 39:28.971
Mm-hmm.
Whoa.

39:29.005 --> 39:31.740
Yeah, and you get to do,
uh, squinty things. What's that?

39:31.775 --> 39:33.375
Review X-rays, forensic reports,

39:33.410 --> 39:37.346
and in return, you give me
your expert analysis.

39:37.380 --> 39:39.915
I don't know what to say.
If you say yes,

39:39.949 --> 39:42.317
I would love you to start
by organizing these.

39:42.352 --> 39:43.786
Already?

39:43.820 --> 39:45.988
Yes. Yes.

39:46.022 --> 39:49.224

How did your test go?

41:40.970 --> 41:43.405
Oh, you know, aced the shooting
range, personal best.

41:43.439 --> 41:45.774
Push-ups, sit-ups
and sprints.

41:45.808 --> 41:47.476
And your cognitives?
Not that I care.

41:47.510 --> 41:49.111
I know you're excellent,
no matter...

41:49.145 --> 41:50.612
Look, I'm not supposed

41:50.647 --> 41:52.447
to get those test results
till next week, so...

41:52.482 --> 41:53.749
They don't matter anyway.

41:53.783 --> 41:55.317
Actually,
you know what?

41:55.351 --> 41:58.387
They do. Look at this.

41:58.421 --> 42:03.292
Sweets... Sweets was able
to pull some strings, and...

42:03.326 --> 42:05.928
Well, 97th percentile?!

42:05.962 --> 42:07.195
My personal best.

42:07.230 --> 42:08.797
That is incredible!

42:08.831 --> 42:11.300
Don't act so surprised.
I just... I meant...

42:11.334 --> 42:12.634
I know, I know, all right?

42:12.669 --> 42:14.736
Next year,
I'm gonna go for 99%.

42:14.771 --> 42:15.885
Very ambitious.

42:15.910 --> 42:17.910
You turned me into a monster.
I'll tell you what.

42:17.974 --> 42:19.608
Why don't we race around
the park here, huh?

42:19.642 --> 42:22.444
In these boots?
So you concede? Great, huh?

42:22.478 --> 42:23.912
That's good, 'cause
you know what?

42:23.947 --> 42:25.614
I'm a little sore.
I'm gonna wake up

42:25.648 --> 42:27.816
in the morning, I'm gonna
feel like one big cramp.

42:27.850 --> 42:30.352
How about a glass
of champagne to celebrate?

42:30.386 --> 42:33.822
Champagne, huh?
Right?

42:33.856 --> 42:36.058
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.
Bubbles doubles. Watch how that pops.

42:36.092 --> 42:37.793
I knew you would do well.

42:37.827 --> 42:39.161
Even though it's technically
illegal for us to drink here.

42:39.195 --> 42:42.230
Oh, come on,
lighten up, will you?

42:42.265 --> 42:43.963
We've already had sex in Virginia.

42:43.988 --> 42:46.696
We're basically outlaws.
We are. Bonnie and Clyde.

42:46.697 --> 42:48.531
Cheers to that one. 
Cheers.

42:48.566 --> 42:51.662
I'll tell you what.
97 percentile. That's pretty...

42:51.663 --> 42:52.294
100 next time.
Did you ever get 100%?
