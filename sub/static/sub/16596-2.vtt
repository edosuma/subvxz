00:05.806 --> 00:08.374
Oh, that audition went so great!

00:09.677 --> 00:11.276
No one is here.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.680
Dang it!
Dramatic entrance ruined.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.281
Mom!

00:16.283 --> 00:17.716
Oh, hey, Liv!

00:17.718 --> 00:18.784
How'd the audition go?

00:23.891 --> 00:26.392
Oh, that audition went so great!

00:29.463 --> 00:31.030
So, did you get it?

00:31.032 --> 00:32.831
Uh, I don't know yet.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.900
But I do know
that they are looking

00:34.902 --> 00:37.503
for a Liv Rooney type,
and I mean, who could be

00:37.505 --> 00:39.371
more Liv Rooney
than Liv Rooney, right?

Ooh.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.745
Hey, Becky.
Did I get the part?

00:46.747 --> 00:48.647
<i>You didn't get the part.</i>

00:49.583 --> 00:50.816
What?

00:50.818 --> 00:52.384
No, they said that
they were looking

00:52.386 --> 00:55.354
for a Liv Rooney type,
and I'm Liv Rooney.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.922

Just shucking some clams that
we got from down on the beach.

02:22.009 --> 02:24.409
You can call me
The Shuck Master.

02:27.014 --> 02:30.516
Yeah, so I'm, like,
never gonna do that.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.819
Hey, thank you so much
for the ride home, Willow.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.788
I am going to change out
of this sweaty T-shirt

02:36.790 --> 02:39.358
before it permanently attaches
itself to my skin.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.528
I am really gross.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.364
I'd argue, but...
you are.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.933
Ugh.

02:49.470 --> 02:52.437
Willow, honey,
could you grab me a platter
from the dining room, please?

02:52.439 --> 02:53.572
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.475
More clams, Mother?

02:56.477 --> 02:57.709
(chuckles)

02:58.979 --> 03:01.079
Here you go, Mrs...

03:02.283 --> 03:03.782
Hey, Joey.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.118
H-- hey, Willow.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.288
I should go.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.491
Joey...

03:12.493 --> 03:13.458
what was that?

03:13.460 --> 03:14.893
I thought you and Willow
were dating.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.028
What happened
to Jillow?

03:17.298 --> 03:19.131
Well...

03:19.133 --> 03:20.699
we broke up.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.401
What?

03:22.403 --> 03:25.637
Oh, you guys have been
so happy since we moved here.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.406
You've been together all summer.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.174
Yeah.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.410
It was the best summer
of my life.

03:31.412 --> 03:34.813
Until about a week ago
when she broke up with me,

03:34.815 --> 03:37.282
<i>completely out of nowhere.</i>

03:38.586 --> 03:42.554
So, another wonderful bike ride
and picnic with your little man.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.089
Yup.

03:44.091 --> 03:48.594
Just like
our five-minute relationship
back at Stevens Point.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.496
Are you sure there
isn't something else
you'd rather do?

03:51.498 --> 03:54.733
Hey, if it ain't broke,
don't fix it, right?

03:54.735 --> 03:56.301
(sighs)

03:58.839 --> 04:01.039
I can't believe
that's how you feel.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.342
That is how I feel.

04:03.344 --> 04:06.345
(sighs)
I don't know what to say.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.582
I don't want
to do this anymore!

04:12.453 --> 04:14.553
What?

04:14.555 --> 04:16.588
No! I'm sick of it, Joey!

04:16.590 --> 04:18.523
Okay.

04:18.525 --> 04:20.592
Okay, well...

04:20.594 --> 04:21.927
if you don't want
to do this anymore,

04:21.929 --> 04:23.695
then-- then I don't want
to do this anymore.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.365
Then I guess Jillow is over!

04:28.936 --> 04:31.236
Well, that doesn't sound
like Willow.

04:31.238 --> 04:33.905
Yeah. I am just as confused
as you are, Mom.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.407
You really think
you know a girl

04:35.409 --> 04:37.643
after she obsessively
follows you for three years.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.447
Something about this story
wasn't adding up.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.584
Joey needed my help,
and I was unemployed and bored.

04:45.586 --> 04:50.322
So, it was time for Momma
to put on her meddlin' pants.

04:53.927 --> 04:54.960
Aunt Karen!

04:54.962 --> 04:56.561
-(gasps)
-Look at my trophy!

04:56.563 --> 04:58.930
Hey, Ruby.
Did you win your game?

04:58.932 --> 05:00.232
No.

05:00.234 --> 05:02.567
Because the Sunny Side
12 and Under League

05:02.569 --> 05:05.671
plays non-competitive
basketball.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.006
She didn't win because...

05:08.008 --> 05:09.675
they don't even keep score.

05:11.578 --> 05:13.111
But I got a trophy

05:13.113 --> 05:15.514
and Coach made us each
a participation bracelet.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.250
She says it's the same color
as our inner sparkle.

05:19.353 --> 05:20.686
Yeah, so wait, get this.

05:20.688 --> 05:23.989
The coach actually said
that having fun

05:23.991 --> 05:25.991
is more important
than winning.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.592
-Mm.
-(laughs)

05:27.594 --> 05:28.660
Stupid coach.

05:28.662 --> 05:32.030
Look, Maddie, is it
really so important

05:32.032 --> 05:34.666
for kids her age to learn
winning and losing?

05:34.668 --> 05:35.767
Yes!

05:35.769 --> 05:37.703
When I won
the state championship,

05:37.705 --> 05:39.671
that was the best moment
of my entire life.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.174
And you know what?
We kept score!

05:42.176 --> 05:45.510
So, trophies
are for winners.
And you know what?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.679
You're gonna get this back
when you know what that means.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.951
She said the same thing
about my "#1 Mom" mug.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.219
(chuckles)

05:55.222 --> 05:56.588
Still haven't gotten that back.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.727
This was a formative moment
in my cousin's young life,

06:01.729 --> 06:03.395
and I mean,
lucky for her,

06:03.397 --> 06:05.530
you know, "Mad Dog" Rooney
was in California

06:05.532 --> 06:07.666
to teach her how
to crush her opponents,

06:07.668 --> 06:09.634
and, uh, I mean,
I don't know.

06:09.636 --> 06:12.738
I kind of wish I had a me
when I was her age.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.673
How do I get
my trophy back?

06:14.675 --> 06:18.143
Uh, okay, um, you're gonna
have to win it back.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.911
Try beating me at something.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.547
Anything.
We could, um...

06:22.549 --> 06:23.648
Oh! Why don't we thumb wrestle?

06:23.650 --> 06:25.350
-Okay.
-Okay.

06:25.352 --> 06:28.520
Both:
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.588
All right.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.157
Oh-- Okay.

06:32.159 --> 06:35.093
I don't exactly get what Maddie
was all fired up about,

06:35.095 --> 06:38.497
but it was fun
watching that vein
in her forehead pop out.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.267
-A, B, C,
one, two, three!
-(grunts)

06:42.269 --> 06:43.769
-I win!
-Ow!

06:43.771 --> 06:46.571
You're right, winning does
feel kind of good!

06:48.108 --> 06:49.674
"Kind of good"?

06:49.676 --> 06:52.077
No, no, no.
Winning feels great.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.545
But you know what?

06:53.547 --> 06:55.781
You're not even gonna know
how great it feels to win

06:55.783 --> 06:58.583
until you know how awful
it feels to lose.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.619
So, you are gonna lose
and you are gonna feel awful!

07:02.356 --> 07:04.189
-Thank you?
-You're welcome!

07:07.561 --> 07:09.060
Okay, so you said
you had some--

07:09.062 --> 07:10.595
Big news!

07:10.597 --> 07:11.696
I got you a job.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.064
What? Seriously?

07:13.066 --> 07:14.633
Someone wants
to hire Liv Rooney,

07:14.635 --> 07:16.067
the actual Liv Rooney?

07:16.069 --> 07:18.804
My clients are the stars
of a hit TV show,

07:18.806 --> 07:22.741
so I pulled some strings
and got you a guest part! Ah!

07:22.743 --> 07:24.142
The Bick's got
your back, baby.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.812
Oh, my acting dry spell is over!

07:26.814 --> 07:30.782
And once you do this job,
Hollywood will trust you again.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.385
-So, what's the show?
-It's called<i> Linda and Heather.</i>

07:34.321 --> 07:35.720
She'll take it!

09:13.887 --> 09:17.522

09:28.602 --> 09:31.169

09:39.780 --> 09:43.081
-Yeah.

Most guest actors
don't last a day,

09:45.385 --> 09:47.252
but this was
the only job I could get you.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.088
Just finish the week
and watch your back.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.791
What?
Becky, you're really,
really scaring me.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.960
You should be scared.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.795
Scared makes you careful,

09:56.797 --> 09:59.898
and careful survives.

09:59.900 --> 10:00.999
Okay, have fun!

10:07.074 --> 10:08.440
Hey, Mrs. R.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.542
Thank you for inviting me
to your book club.

10:10.544 --> 10:11.977
I brought snacks.

10:13.413 --> 10:14.913
Wait a second.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.067
No one's here.

10:19.068 --> 10:20.551
Aww, man, you're bored
and unemployed and looking
for friends.

10:20.554 --> 10:22.954
-I'm here for you, Mrs. R!
-Oh!

10:22.956 --> 10:25.090
-You're not wrong!
-Ohh.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.725
But...

10:26.727 --> 10:27.993
I want to talk about Joey.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.694
So, have a seat.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.263
Now what happened?

10:32.265 --> 10:34.733
Why did you break up
with Joey?

10:34.735 --> 10:36.801
What do you mean?
I didn't break up with him.

10:36.803 --> 10:37.902
He broke up with me.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.938
-What?
-Yeah.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.539
Let me tell you the story.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.643
<i>The summer started out great.</i>

10:44.645 --> 10:48.947
What a great date:
riding our tandem love cycle

10:48.949 --> 10:50.815
and picnicking
on baloney sandwiches.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.817
(sighs)

10:53.954 --> 10:56.287
Just like we did
on our first date.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.623
Joey, this is so romantic.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.258
<i>But as the summer went on,</i>

11:00.260 --> 11:02.861
<i>it got less</i>
<i>and less great.</i>

11:02.863 --> 11:04.596
Mmm.

11:04.598 --> 11:06.831
Another bike ride
baloney picnic.

11:06.833 --> 11:10.168
How exactly the same
as last time.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.971
<i>He kept doing the exact same</i>
<i>bike ride picnic date</i>

11:12.973 --> 11:14.339
<i>all summer long.</i>

11:14.341 --> 11:16.007
<i>Until finally...</i>

11:16.009 --> 11:21.179
So, another wonderful bike ride
and picnic with your little man.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.034
Yup.

11:26.035 --> 11:28.219
Just like
our five-minute relationship
back at Stevens Point.

11:28.221 --> 11:32.057
Are you sure there
isn't something else
you'd rather do?

11:32.059 --> 11:34.926
If it ain't broke,
don't fix it, right?

11:39.332 --> 11:40.965
I can't believe
that's how you feel.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.601
Yeah. It is how I feel.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.105
I don't know what to say.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.777
I don't want
to do this anymore!

11:53.980 --> 11:55.747
You don't?

11:55.749 --> 11:58.049
No. I'm sick of it, Joey.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.302
Okay.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.554
Okay, well,
if you don't want
to do this anymore,

12:02.556 --> 12:05.256
then I don't want
to do this anymore.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.894
Then I guess Jillow is over.

12:13.166 --> 12:16.101
This is a classic case
of he thought/she thought.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.403
Well, you know
what me thought?
What I think?

12:19.339 --> 12:21.706
The three of us need
to sit down and talk.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.074
(sighs)
That's a great idea.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.111
Oh, well, since you're in
the advice-receiving mood,

12:26.113 --> 12:29.114
let's talk about
these hoop earrings.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.316
Stay in your lane,
Mrs. Rooney.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.929
Jump, jump, jump.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.030
I win again!

12:46.032 --> 12:47.098
What am I supposed to say?

12:47.100 --> 12:50.301
You're supposed to say,
"Bam! What?"

12:50.303 --> 12:52.904
I know you said
winning feels great,

12:52.906 --> 12:54.639
but I've been winning all day

12:54.641 --> 12:56.841
and I'm actually kind of
getting bored.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.577
Is that the lesson?

12:59.579 --> 13:00.945
No, that is not the lesson!

13:02.749 --> 13:06.050
The lesson was teaching her
about the pain of losing,

13:06.052 --> 13:08.086
but I can't do that
until I beat her.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.822
(chuckles)
Just one time!

13:10.824 --> 13:13.091
This is called Hot Hands.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.059
This is Patty-Cake's
evil older cousin.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.429
My mom said
no one's evil.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.964
Just misunderstood.

13:19.966 --> 13:24.135
Wow, you-- you just--
You never had a chance.

13:26.339 --> 13:30.408
Anyway, uh, so the object
of Hot Hands is to slap

13:30.410 --> 13:33.344
the other person's hand
before they pull away, so.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.347
Missed me!
My turn.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.621
(screams)

13:43.623 --> 13:45.356
I win again!

13:45.358 --> 13:46.825
Victory dance.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.927
Bam! What?

13:48.929 --> 13:50.628
Bam! What?

13:50.630 --> 13:51.863
Bam! What?

13:51.865 --> 13:53.164
Bam! What?

13:53.166 --> 13:55.200
-Bam! What?
-Okay, okay, okay,
no, no, no.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.534
Ruby, Ruby!

13:56.536 --> 13:58.336
You can't...
You can't do ballet

13:58.338 --> 14:00.438
as a victory dance, okay?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.540
I mean, you know,
for-- for a victory dance,

14:02.542 --> 14:05.210
you gotta dab
or you gotta cabbage patch.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.377
Or if you really,
really mean it,

14:06.379 --> 14:08.012
you know, you do
the chicken neck.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.049
(chuckles)

14:12.319 --> 14:13.651
Tell you what,

14:13.653 --> 14:17.055
um, when you win, you can do
whatever dance you want.

14:17.057 --> 14:21.059
Until then,
eat my grand jeté.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.460
Bam! What?

14:22.462 --> 14:23.628
Bam! What?

14:23.630 --> 14:25.230
Bam! What?

14:30.837 --> 14:33.538
Greetings,
fellow space comrades.

14:38.845 --> 14:42.513
I am Dr. Icevanka Icevankovich.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.482
To whom do I have

14:44.484 --> 14:46.150
the pleasure of meeting?

14:47.254 --> 14:50.054
I'm so glad you asked.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.190
-♪ Pink, pink, pink ♪
-♪ Girls, girls, girls ♪

14:52.192 --> 14:54.259
Both:
♪ Glitter, glitter, glitter,
Twirls, twirls, twirls ♪

14:54.261 --> 14:56.461
This is the greatest day
of my life.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.696
Oh.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.531
I don't get a lot of hugs,

15:00.533 --> 15:03.668
but when I do,
I enjoy them.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.605
-Liv is crushing it.
-Yup.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.841
As long as she can manage
to keep from starting

15:09.843 --> 15:11.242
an argument
between the girls,

15:11.244 --> 15:13.678
she just might make it
to the end of the week.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.213
One more hug!

15:15.215 --> 15:17.115
Nope. You smell
like a litter box.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.619
Both:
♪ Best friends! ♪

15:23.256 --> 15:27.191
Thank you for wonderful
song, best friends.

15:27.193 --> 15:31.129
The United Space Nations
of the World have sent me

15:31.131 --> 15:33.097
vital fuel cell
for reactor.

15:34.901 --> 15:36.267
And...

15:36.269 --> 15:37.936
-And I'm so sorry.
-(bell rings)

15:37.938 --> 15:40.772
Um, my script
actually didn't say

15:40.774 --> 15:41.973
whether I'm supposed to give

15:41.975 --> 15:44.042
the fuel cell
to Linda or to Heather.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.410
Both:
Give it to me.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.045
Don't give it to her.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.013
She should give it to me!

15:51.251 --> 15:53.818
Last time
we got critical supplies,

15:53.820 --> 15:55.620
you got
the strawberry lip gloss.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.255
Well, you got
the bigger dressing room.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.290
Well, it's not
<i>Heather and Linda.</i>

15:59.292 --> 16:00.892
It's<i> Linda and Heather!</i>

16:03.296 --> 16:05.063
Well, my fan page

16:05.065 --> 16:07.165
has 13 more followers
than yours.

16:07.167 --> 16:10.168
Oh yeah?
Well, behind your back,

16:10.170 --> 16:12.770
everyone on stage
calls you Stank Breath.

16:12.772 --> 16:13.838
(gasps)

16:15.408 --> 16:16.808
Do you?

16:16.810 --> 16:18.576
-Do you?
-They do!

16:20.146 --> 16:21.846
I can't work
with you anymore!

16:21.848 --> 16:24.449
-I quit!
-I quit too!

16:24.451 --> 16:26.584
<i>Linda and Heather</i> is over!

16:26.586 --> 16:27.986
-Over!
-Over!

16:27.988 --> 16:29.654
-(both scoff)
-(wails)

16:29.656 --> 16:30.855
(bell rings)

16:30.857 --> 16:33.024
Liv, you broke
Linda and Heather.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.659
No more pink,
no more girls,

16:34.661 --> 16:36.861
no more glitter,
and no more twirls!

16:36.863 --> 16:38.496
Not friends!

16:39.833 --> 16:41.666
Don't blame yourself, Liv.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.335
Those two have had issues
for a long time.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.503
Oh, thank you, Becky.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.972
But...

16:47.974 --> 16:50.475
that's not how Hollywood
is going to spin it.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.777
The headline is going to be

16:52.779 --> 16:55.980
"Liv Rooney, the girl
who quit<i> Voltage</i> , shuts down
<i>Linda and Heather</i> "!

16:55.982 --> 16:58.349
What? No! Ugh!

16:58.351 --> 17:00.284
We have to fix this,
otherwise I'm gonna be known

17:00.286 --> 17:02.020
as the girl
who ruined two shows!

17:04.958 --> 17:07.191
I'll take that
litter box hug now, Becky.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.232
So, when Willow said,

17:14.234 --> 17:16.300
"I don't want
to do this anymore,"

17:16.302 --> 17:18.536
she was talking about
the tandem bike picnic,

17:18.538 --> 17:21.005
but you thought
she didn't want to date anymore.

17:21.007 --> 17:23.841
Ohh.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.710
And Joey only broke up with you

17:25.712 --> 17:27.378
because he thought
you were breaking up with him.

17:28.314 --> 17:30.415
Ohh.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.350
So, really neither
of your versions

17:32.352 --> 17:35.286
of what happened to Jillow
were 100% accurate.

17:36.222 --> 17:39.323
Both:
Ohh.

17:39.325 --> 17:41.993
Willow, I'm so sorry.

17:41.995 --> 17:44.262
Our five-minute relationship
was just so perfect.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.997
I was afraid
to try anything else

17:45.999 --> 17:47.665
because I didn't want
to mess things up.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.567
I'm sorry too.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.170
Our five-minute relationship
was perfect.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.205
I was just tired
of repeating it.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.406
I should have been more clear.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.408
Oh, this is wonderful.
I saved Jillow.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.143
Jillow is back.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.247
Actually, I don't know
about that.

18:03.249 --> 18:06.017
Maybe our five-minute
relationship was so perfect

18:06.019 --> 18:07.685
because it was
just five minutes.

18:08.621 --> 18:11.122
Maybe that's all
it was meant to be.

18:12.058 --> 18:13.191
For now.

18:13.193 --> 18:17.895
Any chance you'd be happy
just keeping that memory perfect

18:17.897 --> 18:20.031
and just being friends?

18:20.033 --> 18:22.066
I would love that.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.601
Joey Rooney,

18:23.603 --> 18:25.470
would you not date me?

18:26.406 --> 18:27.472
Willow Cruz,

18:27.474 --> 18:30.007
I would be honored
not to date you.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.949
Ah! Linda and Heather are here

18:37.951 --> 18:39.317
to clear out
their dressing room.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.918
Okay, we have one chance
to fix this

18:40.920 --> 18:43.221
before Linda and Heather walk
off this stage forever.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.123
So, Parker,
do you know your lines?

18:46.126 --> 18:47.492
I'm ready.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.496
I don't like
trickin' my girls, but...

18:51.498 --> 18:54.232
(robotic voice)
I have to trick them
to save them.

18:57.003 --> 19:00.238
I've never been on this side
of the camera before.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.206
It's electrifying.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.444
(gasps)
Liv...

19:06.446 --> 19:08.112
I spoke with the network.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.414
We're making a few changes
to the show.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.316
You're still Icevanka.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.685
This is your robot, Bobby.

19:14.687 --> 19:15.987
Oh.

19:15.989 --> 19:19.090
I am programmed
to get funky.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.194
Let's hear the new theme song.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.764
-♪ Me, me, me ♪
-♪ You, you, you ♪

19:26.766 --> 19:28.833
Both:
♪ Ice, ice, ice,
Bolts, bolts, bolts ♪

19:28.835 --> 19:30.601
♪ Together forever ♪

19:30.603 --> 19:32.803
-♪ Icevanka ♪
-♪ And Bobby ♪

19:32.805 --> 19:34.705
Both:
♪ Space friends ♪

19:39.279 --> 19:41.445
Put those jazz hands down!

19:43.550 --> 19:46.517
You can't steal that song
or the show.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.286
Sorry, girls.

19:48.288 --> 19:52.356
You quit the show,
but the show must go on!

19:53.960 --> 19:55.660
Yeah, and thank you
for that, by the way,

19:55.662 --> 19:57.662
because I was really
hurtin' for a job,

19:57.664 --> 20:00.097
but then you quit
and I totally got yours!

20:01.568 --> 20:02.633
No way.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.369
This is my song

20:05.371 --> 20:07.672
and my show.
I'm un-quitting.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.340
You mean...

20:09.342 --> 20:11.409
our song
and our show, bestie.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.577
I un-quit too.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.580
Oh, no, you can't.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.415
I mean, it's too late.
Right, Becky?

20:17.417 --> 20:19.550
Liv...

20:19.552 --> 20:22.186
this is awkward...

20:22.188 --> 20:27.091
but it is in their contract that
they have 24 hours to un-quit.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.426
Oh!

20:28.428 --> 20:29.894
Sorry...

20:29.896 --> 20:32.663
but the<i> Linda and Heather</i>
show is back on!

20:32.665 --> 20:33.764
(both squeal)

20:34.901 --> 20:37.368
We are never gonna
fight again, Heather,

20:37.370 --> 20:40.204
because you are
the best friend ever.

20:40.206 --> 20:42.974
Well, you just started
another fight, Linda.

20:44.177 --> 20:46.210
Because you're
the best friend ever!

20:46.212 --> 20:47.011
-Linda: Oh!
-(both laugh)

20:50.617 --> 20:52.516
Both:
Kiss, kiss, miss, miss.

20:55.221 --> 20:57.688
You did it, Liv!
You saved<i> Linda and Heather.</i>

20:57.690 --> 21:01.125
Oh, the acting jobs are
going to start pouring in!

21:01.127 --> 21:03.427
I know this wasn't
an easy week,

21:03.429 --> 21:08.466
and my girls
weren't exactly pleasant, but...

21:08.468 --> 21:10.568
(voice cracks)
I love this show.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.436
Thank you for saving it.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.477
(chuckles)

21:21.581 --> 21:24.649
Your hands are so tiny,
but so painful!

21:26.753 --> 21:29.520
Okay, you know what?
That's it. I'm done. You win.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.125
I'm sorry, Maddie.

21:34.127 --> 21:37.028
I know you really wanted
to teach me about losing.

21:38.564 --> 21:40.164
Mm.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.633
No. I mean, I'm...

21:42.635 --> 21:44.602
the one who should be sorry.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.504
'Cause if I...

21:46.506 --> 21:49.073
hadn't been so obsessed
with winning,

21:49.075 --> 21:51.642
we could have been
having fun today.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.945
Oh, maybe that's the lesson.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.615
I was wondering how many times
I'd have to slap her

21:57.617 --> 21:59.817
before she got the lesson.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.620
The answer is 375.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.655
Thank you for playing.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.090
I got you a trophy

22:06.092 --> 22:08.192
and I made you
a participation bracelet.

22:08.194 --> 22:09.593
Oh.

22:09.595 --> 22:10.828
Ruby...

22:10.830 --> 22:12.697
Thank you.
That really means

22:12.699 --> 22:14.031
a lot to me!

22:14.033 --> 22:17.034
Ohh!

22:17.036 --> 22:19.770
That is how you do it!
Bam! What?

22:19.772 --> 22:23.040
(vocalizes)

22:26.112 --> 22:28.813
Linda:<i> Thank you for visiting</i>
<i>our space station, Icevanka.</i>

22:28.815 --> 22:31.649
Heather:<i> Don't let the airlock</i>
<i>hit you on the way out.</i>

22:31.651 --> 22:33.517
(Linda and Heather laugh)

22:33.519 --> 22:34.885
(music plays)

22:36.622 --> 22:39.957
Gotta be honest.
I'd rather be watching
<i>Icevanka and Bobby.</i>

22:39.959 --> 22:40.991

22:40.993 --> 22:42.493

a show killer,

22:52.672 --> 22:53.971
you're a show saver!

22:53.973 --> 22:55.573
The network wants you

22:55.575 --> 22:58.642
to reprise your role
of Stephanie Einstein.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.212
What?

23:01.214 --> 23:04.315
Wait, they want me to do

23:05.752 --> 23:07.669

23:09.589 --> 23:10.821
Not kidding.

23:10.823 --> 23:13.357

23:27.407 --> 23:30.241
Parker, I think we both know
the answer to that.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.010
Linda and Heather:
