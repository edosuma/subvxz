fuck the whole game up
and just join the orchestra.

- Viola.

Yeah, I didn't have
that kind of choice, though.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.806

16:12.806 --> 16:15.100
so I just stuck out
like a sore thumb, you know?

I didn't have
much choice either.

make a difference.

a way more interesting adult.

this great conversation

Shouldn't we be panicking?
Like, running around screaming?

Probably.

get us, something else will.

I trust humanity.

Humanity is the problem.
We fuck everything up.

No, think about it.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.533
Ten thousand years ago,

18:36.533 --> 18:39.202
we were living in caves,
eating sticks and shit.

18:39.202 --> 18:43.373
And now
we're on man-made grass,

18:45.750 --> 18:48.253

kind of gets you fucked up.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.546
Humans made all that happen.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.047
We're kind of amazing.

I don't know.
This wine's not that good.

Also, I don't think
we ever ate sticks.

You try to sink this putt.

you're right.

- Then we'll know.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.995

have to tell me a secret.

I'll tell you one.

- Okay?
