WEBVTT

00:01.379 --> 00:03.434
- The board is voting next week.
- How close are we?

00:03.450 --> 00:06.015
We'd only need to turn one more
board member to save the school.

00:06.039 --> 00:07.750
I heard back from the
people at Eminent Power.

00:07.774 --> 00:09.174
They only want me.

00:09.209 --> 00:10.586
I told them I won't do it without you.

00:10.610 --> 00:12.377
Well, I'm not gonna drop outta school.

00:12.412 --> 00:14.446
- You will probably get a...
A para-professional.

00:14.481 --> 00:15.913
It's an educational aide.

00:15.949 --> 00:18.048
- Are you drunk?
- Mostly high.

00:18.084 --> 00:19.361
I've been meaning to talk to you.

00:19.385 --> 00:21.185
I got a text from Nick.

00:21.220 --> 00:23.553
He told me that he can
help us save Anchor Beach.

00:23.589 --> 00:26.190
I did have those feelings for you.

00:26.225 --> 00:27.324
What if I'm gay?

00:27.660 --> 00:29.726
You used to do that all the
time when we were married.

00:29.761 --> 00:32.363
You'd forget to breathe. It used
to scare the bejesus out of me.

00:32.398 --> 00:34.198
There is a new treatment we offer here

00:34.233 --> 00:35.798
for recurrent adolescent leukemia.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.166
I wanna do it.

00:37.202 --> 00:39.869
We need to take a big step back.

00:39.904 --> 00:42.438
Ximena can't leave until
her DACA is sorted out.

00:42.474 --> 00:44.740
- Have you found Poppy?
- We're fostering her.

00:48.746 --> 00:51.080
Everybody is home for
dinner tonight, yes?

00:51.116 --> 00:52.680
Um, I should be.

00:52.716 --> 00:54.849
Uh, I'm taking Poppy to her house

00:54.885 --> 00:56.429
to get some more clothes
and stuff for Ximena,

00:56.453 --> 00:57.952
but we won't be that long.

00:57.988 --> 01:00.088
Any news on her DACA status?

01:00.124 --> 01:02.024
- Not yet.
- What about their parents?

01:02.059 --> 01:04.825
No, I still don't know
where they're being detained.

01:04.861 --> 01:06.561
How can they do that to people?

01:06.596 --> 01:08.497
Hey, B?

01:09.565 --> 01:11.798
How's Grace doing?

01:11.834 --> 01:13.767
Uh, good, yeah. She's going home today.

01:13.802 --> 01:15.403
Really?

01:15.438 --> 01:17.038
When they putting her T-cells back in?

01:17.073 --> 01:20.641
Uh, I guess it takes the lab a
few weeks to, like, recode them.

01:20.676 --> 01:22.643
And then what do they do?

01:22.678 --> 01:26.212
Uh, they're supposed to attack
the cancer cells, and kill them.

01:26.248 --> 01:28.614
- So she'll be cured?
- Hopefully.

01:33.655 --> 01:36.689
Your para, David, will
meet you in homeroom.

01:36.724 --> 01:38.891
Uh, Poppy, you're going
to be in Jesus' class

01:38.927 --> 01:40.071
and he'll show you the way, okay?

01:40.095 --> 01:41.161
Okay.

01:41.196 --> 01:42.873
And I'll walk you to
the rest of your classes.

01:42.897 --> 01:44.441
What am I supposed to
tell people when they...

01:44.465 --> 01:47.032
they ask me who this guy
is that's following me?

01:47.068 --> 01:49.668
Honey, you're gonna tell them
that he's an in-class aide

01:49.703 --> 01:52.082
who's there to help you catch
up on everything you've missed.

01:52.106 --> 01:54.940
Listen, a positive attitude
is gonna go a long way

01:54.975 --> 01:56.608
to helping you here, okay?

01:56.643 --> 01:57.820
You have to manage your frustrations

01:57.844 --> 01:59.511
- so you won't have another...
- Outburst.

01:59.547 --> 02:01.546
Yeah, Mama, I know. You already told me.

02:01.581 --> 02:03.881
Okay, don't forget to write things down.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.483
- Your short term memory...
- Sucks.

02:05.518 --> 02:07.718
- I know.
- Honey, it doesn't suck.

02:07.753 --> 02:11.789
- It does.
- You just... you're just recovering.

02:11.824 --> 02:13.984
And don't worry, all your
teachers know what to expect.

02:17.429 --> 02:18.562
- Poppy?
- Huh?

02:18.597 --> 02:22.132
- How are you feeling?
- Uh, fine, thanks.

02:22.167 --> 02:24.079
I know it's nerve-wracking
going to a new school,

02:24.103 --> 02:26.436
but I hope you understand that
the logistics of getting you

02:26.472 --> 02:28.049
to and from your old
school every morning,

02:28.073 --> 02:29.184
it was just a little tricky.

02:29.208 --> 02:30.840
Yeah, no, it's... it's cool.

02:30.875 --> 02:33.510
I'm, uh, excited to
start school on the beach.

02:34.512 --> 02:36.156
Wait, does this mean
that she can vote "no"

02:36.180 --> 02:37.180
on Anchor Beach Academy?

02:38.216 --> 02:39.448
I don't see why not.

02:39.484 --> 02:41.317
Yay!

02:41.352 --> 02:43.185
Not that I'm worried
about Drew or anything.

02:43.221 --> 02:45.821
He can put up all the professionally
printed posters he wants.

02:45.856 --> 02:48.768
I've barely heard of anyone
who wants ABCC to go private.

02:48.862 --> 02:51.229
It's cool they're actually
letting the kids get a vote.

02:51.264 --> 02:54.131
Yeah. All we need is one
more board member and we win.

02:54.167 --> 02:56.601
What's up with Monica Davis, Mama?

02:56.636 --> 02:58.769
She still hasn't
decided, but don't worry.

02:59.906 --> 03:01.472
I'm working her.

03:03.803 --> 03:05.000
_

03:05.011 --> 03:08.412
Whoa! Uh, it doesn't look
like Drew put that one up.

03:08.447 --> 03:10.314
Okay, so a few misguided
souls are willing

03:10.349 --> 03:12.060
to betray their classmates
for a swimming pool.

03:12.084 --> 03:13.517
Big deal.

03:19.091 --> 03:20.490
Here we are!

03:21.860 --> 03:23.627
Oh! And here you are.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.294
Aw! Locker buddies.

03:26.397 --> 03:27.697
Hey.

03:32.803 --> 03:34.670
What's up?

03:34.706 --> 03:36.584
Come on now, these are
the middle school lockers.

03:36.608 --> 03:38.307
I'm sure that's all that was open.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.775
You'll be with us senior year.

03:40.945 --> 03:42.144
This is ridiculous.

03:43.847 --> 03:46.548
- What are you doing?
- Just in case.

03:47.551 --> 03:48.983
Here's your locker combo.

03:50.287 --> 03:52.053
Good luck. I'll see you at lunch.

03:55.259 --> 03:56.391
You're gonna do great.

03:56.426 --> 03:57.903
- Everyone's gonna love you.
- Thanks.

03:57.927 --> 04:00.461
And you? Don't be an asshole
to your para-professional.

04:00.496 --> 04:04.632
- Word, thanks.
- Wait, so what does para-professional mean?

04:04.667 --> 04:07.901
Uh, I don't know. It's like
almost professional or something.

04:07.936 --> 04:11.438
Okay.

04:11.474 --> 04:14.642
- You ready for this?
- As long as I get to sit in the back with you.

04:14.677 --> 04:17.343
- Yeah, just...
- Jesus!

04:17.379 --> 04:18.745
David. Nice to meet you.

04:18.779 --> 04:20.747
Got us a couple seats right up front.

04:20.781 --> 04:23.182
Uh, do we have to?

04:23.217 --> 04:24.817
I mean, we want to be focused, don't we?

04:26.521 --> 04:28.354
- Yeah. That's great.
- Great.

04:29.857 --> 04:31.123
I'll see you after class.

04:33.000 --> 04:39.074

05:15.834 --> 05:16.933
Hey.

05:16.968 --> 05:19.669
- Oh! What is this?
- That's apology fruit.

05:21.072 --> 05:23.005
For getting hammered at prom.

05:23.041 --> 05:26.575
And telling everyone that
you took my virginity?

05:26.610 --> 05:28.109
Yeah, and that.

05:28.145 --> 05:30.045
Although, it did get me thinking.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.625
I'm not sure it's
exactly feminist to talk

05:31.649 --> 05:33.382
about a man taking a woman's virginity.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.516
Like taking.

05:34.552 --> 05:36.685
Feminist or not, keep your trap shut.

05:36.721 --> 05:38.220
Heard that!

05:38.255 --> 05:39.822
Wanna read that card?

05:41.991 --> 05:45.360
"Sorry I got so strunk."

05:45.395 --> 05:46.694
Stoned and drunk.

05:48.698 --> 05:51.265
"Which is what I definitely won't be

05:51.300 --> 05:53.334
if you let me take you out for real."

05:54.637 --> 05:57.104
- Are you serious?
- As a melon ball.

05:59.908 --> 06:02.275
Monica, you helped form this charter.

06:02.310 --> 06:04.010
You and I wrote the first draft

06:04.045 --> 06:06.414
of the mission statement
together on construction paper

06:06.448 --> 06:07.714
at our kids' playdate.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.616
And we made a promise to nurture

06:09.651 --> 06:12.085
and motivate and challenge our students.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.965
Now, I know that things
have been bumpy recently.

06:13.989 --> 06:16.032
But that doesn't mean that we
should go back on that promise

06:16.056 --> 06:18.223
for those kids who can't
afford a private school.

06:18.259 --> 06:20.760
We need to look to that
original mission statement

06:20.795 --> 06:22.127
and get back to work.

06:25.299 --> 06:27.366
Okay. You're right.

06:27.402 --> 06:30.302
- You're right.
- Really? So we have your vote?

06:30.337 --> 06:32.337
Like I was gonna vote
against Norma Rae here.

06:35.108 --> 06:37.542
- I will see you at the meeting.
- Thank you.

06:37.577 --> 06:39.076
This should be fun.

06:40.213 --> 06:41.546
Thank you.

06:43.450 --> 06:44.849
Yes!

06:45.886 --> 06:47.952
Okay, so...

06:47.987 --> 06:49.720
all we need now are the students.

06:49.755 --> 06:51.422
Yeah.

06:51.457 --> 06:54.090
Is there any way I can
convince you to stay if we win?

06:55.193 --> 06:57.260
No, I'll stick around until the vote,

06:57.296 --> 06:59.262
but I'm not gonna stay
here and wait for them

06:59.298 --> 07:00.731
to find some reason to fire me.

07:02.468 --> 07:04.435
What are some of the
similarities you see

07:04.470 --> 07:06.836
in the tales of Winesburg's residents?

07:06.871 --> 07:08.971
- Yeah?
- Loneliness?

07:09.006 --> 07:12.041
Good. And what's the primary
cause of that loneliness?

07:12.076 --> 07:13.621
No one talks to each other.

07:13.645 --> 07:16.479
- You write that down?
- Uh, no, I... I mean...

07:16.514 --> 07:18.915
- Uh, I will.
- Which begs the question...

07:18.950 --> 07:20.616
- are they trapped by the town?
- I-N.

07:20.652 --> 07:22.296
- I... I got it.
- Or are they trapped by themselves?

07:22.320 --> 07:24.464
You don't got it, 'cause you're
not writing down what he's saying.

07:24.488 --> 07:26.866
I can't hear what he's saying
because you keep talking to me.

07:28.291 --> 07:29.658
Okay, so for tomorrow,

07:29.693 --> 07:32.093
I want you to read
the next three stories.

07:32.128 --> 07:34.228
You can use my notes,
but you need to focus.

07:36.066 --> 07:37.466
Have a good day, everyone!

07:38.368 --> 07:40.601
Jesus, good to have you back.

07:40.636 --> 07:43.337
Look, um, don't worry about
reading three stories tonight.

07:43.372 --> 07:45.906
Okay? Just try and get through one.

07:45.942 --> 07:47.341
Thanks.

07:48.544 --> 07:50.511
Less homework and some
guy takes notes for you?

07:51.614 --> 07:53.046
Wish someone'd hit me in the head.

07:59.253 --> 08:00.253
Ready?

08:03.024 --> 08:04.557
So...

08:04.593 --> 08:05.992
I took your advice.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.259
About UCSD.

08:07.295 --> 08:09.261
I'm gonna apply for social work,

08:09.297 --> 08:10.830
and then transfer to Art later.

08:11.967 --> 08:13.432
And that way I can take my time

08:13.468 --> 08:15.000
with my portfolio and everything.

08:15.035 --> 08:18.370
That's cool. And who knows,
you might like social work.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.641
I know you don't think
I should be an artist.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.275
What?!

08:24.311 --> 08:25.511
That's not true.

08:26.847 --> 08:28.207
Do you remember when we first met?

08:29.149 --> 08:31.416
What did I say when you told me that...

08:31.451 --> 08:34.952
Sorry. When Cameron told me that you...

08:34.988 --> 08:36.654
that you wanted to be a photographer.

08:38.024 --> 08:39.756
You said it was brave.

08:41.092 --> 08:42.126
Exactly.

08:42.160 --> 08:43.995
Yeah, well, I want to be brave,

08:44.030 --> 08:46.163
but I really want to go to UCSD.

08:46.198 --> 08:47.398
So...

08:47.433 --> 08:50.266
I think I just have to
play it safe for now.

08:50.301 --> 08:52.936
Honestly, I don't see
how I could possibly

08:52.971 --> 08:54.538
finish my portfolio in time

08:54.573 --> 08:56.293
with everything that's
going on with Ximena.

08:57.643 --> 09:00.176
It's like a relief to
have the pressure off.

09:00.211 --> 09:01.912
Then, uh...

09:01.947 --> 09:03.212
social work it is.

09:03.248 --> 09:04.480
Yeah.

09:09.186 --> 09:13.589
I think we might have to
talk about what friends do.

09:13.624 --> 09:16.391
- What? Friends don't hold hands?
- No.

09:16.427 --> 09:18.193
And they don't surprise their friends

09:18.228 --> 09:19.628
with picnics on the beach, either.

09:19.664 --> 09:23.064
Oh, come on. I do this all the
time for the guys in my study group.

09:34.911 --> 09:36.310
Feels good to be back.

09:38.114 --> 09:40.213
Home again. Home again.

09:40.248 --> 09:42.115
And I got you a surprise.

09:43.619 --> 09:45.485
You... you bought me a new TV!

09:45.520 --> 09:48.421
- And cable.
- Grace. Wow. Heh!

09:48.457 --> 09:52.225
Um... are... are you staying here?

09:52.260 --> 09:55.128
Well, I can't afford to
stay in a hotel indefinitely,

09:55.163 --> 09:57.463
and you need someone with you 24/7.

09:57.498 --> 09:59.398
So...

09:59.433 --> 10:01.200
Ah! The delivery guy's here.

10:01.235 --> 10:03.703
You know, at first, I thought
I would get a blow-up mattress,

10:03.738 --> 10:05.053
but then I thought
that'd be too much work,

10:05.054 --> 10:06.516
so I just got a pull-out couch.

10:06.540 --> 10:07.618
Okay.

10:07.642 --> 10:09.775
Did you know anything about this?

10:09.811 --> 10:11.510
No!

10:11.545 --> 10:12.825
When are we ever gonna be alone?

10:13.780 --> 10:15.091
Well, I mean, we can still go out.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.148
- For sex?
- Um...

10:17.183 --> 10:20.318
Sex is out of the question.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.520
So, where do you want the couch?

10:27.794 --> 10:29.030
Mom, you gotta be kidding me.

10:29.065 --> 10:30.832
No, Grace, I am not kidding you.

10:30.867 --> 10:33.267
In your condition, sex is very risky.

10:33.303 --> 10:35.136
Mom, it's not up to you!

10:35.171 --> 10:37.871
And... and I can decide
whether it's risky or not.

10:37.906 --> 10:41.341
- Brandon is a very considerate lover.
- Oh, God...

10:41.376 --> 10:43.896
And we're gonna continue to have
sex whether you like it or not.

10:47.649 --> 10:49.149
So, you ever heard of Declan Rivers?

10:49.184 --> 10:51.751
Yeah! His live streams are hilarious.

10:51.786 --> 10:53.219
I know, right!

10:53.254 --> 10:55.687
Well, uh, that's who Eminent
Power wants me to play with.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.422
So, I'm supposed to meet him tomorrow.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.727
What? Why?

11:03.564 --> 11:06.598
Look, I know I said I wouldn't
do it if you didn't want me to.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.934
But I really want to.

11:08.970 --> 11:11.635
And I think you should be happy for me!

11:11.671 --> 11:13.537
You know, as my best friend.

11:13.573 --> 11:16.040
Well, as my best friend,

11:16.076 --> 11:17.942
I think you shouldn't
want to do it without me.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.211
I don't want to do it without you.

11:20.247 --> 11:23.281
But... they're not asking you.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.017
Fine.

11:27.052 --> 11:28.185
Whatever.

11:28.220 --> 11:31.355
But FYI, I would never
treat you like this.

11:45.236 --> 11:48.871
Wait, so does he, like, go
to the bathroom with you?

11:48.907 --> 11:51.274
Yeah, only when he needs
to change my diaper.

11:51.309 --> 11:52.953
Listen up, everyone!

11:52.977 --> 11:56.345
Tomorrow's our vote to decide
the fate of Anchor Beach.

11:56.381 --> 11:59.348
And what we decide is
extremely important.

11:59.384 --> 12:02.550
Anchor Beach Academy is going to
have an advanced STEAM program,

12:02.585 --> 12:04.552
an Olympic-sized pool,

12:04.587 --> 12:07.855
a media center, a
state-of-the-art auditorium.

12:07.891 --> 12:09.524
They're gonna hire college counselors

12:09.559 --> 12:11.159
with connections to the Ivy League.

12:11.194 --> 12:13.494
This could change our lives.

12:15.365 --> 12:18.232
How do we know that they're gonna
fulfill all of these promises?

12:18.267 --> 12:20.334
Look, we have the opportunity

12:20.369 --> 12:22.436
to make Anchor Beach a great school.

12:22.471 --> 12:24.071
And for the students
who already go here,

12:24.106 --> 12:25.973
we're being offered
a huge cut in tuition.

12:26.008 --> 12:30.077
Okay! Well, what about the families
that can't afford to pay anything?

12:30.112 --> 12:31.878
How many of you or your friends

12:31.914 --> 12:33.948
are gonna have to leave Anchor Beach?

12:33.983 --> 12:35.881
What makes this school so special

12:35.917 --> 12:38.818
is that we all come from
different backgrounds.

12:38.853 --> 12:40.753
No amount of money can buy that!

12:40.788 --> 12:42.888
- Yeah!
- Don't be fooled.

12:42.924 --> 12:46.659
A private education is not
necessarily a better one.

12:46.694 --> 12:48.627
Vote "no" and save our school!

12:50.999 --> 12:52.230
Hell, yeah!

13:01.808 --> 13:04.509
Are you really gonna
film everything we do?

13:04.544 --> 13:07.012
Yeah, I need good
stuff for your web page.

13:09.182 --> 13:11.748
Um, so how are you feeling today?

13:17.423 --> 13:20.024
Like an animal at the zoo.

13:20.059 --> 13:22.126
I mean, everyone at
church is really nice,

13:22.161 --> 13:24.996
but I'm starting to
lose my mind in here.

13:25.031 --> 13:26.162
Anything from your lawyer?

13:29.101 --> 13:30.233
Not yet.

13:36.241 --> 13:37.474
Hello?

13:39.411 --> 13:40.710
Helen!

13:42.280 --> 13:43.712
Is that for me?

13:43.747 --> 13:45.780
Mm-hmm. Not gonna let a
little immigration snafu

13:45.816 --> 13:47.056
get in the way of your studies.

13:48.219 --> 13:50.386
- Thank you.
- You may grab these.

13:53.557 --> 13:55.435
I still expect you to
finish all your work on time.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.327
Mm! Don't worry about
that. All I got is time.

14:00.330 --> 14:02.563
How's the portfolio coming along?

14:02.598 --> 14:05.166
Yeah, I actually wanted
to talk to you about that.

14:06.436 --> 14:07.868
- Let's chat.
- Yeah.

14:10.106 --> 14:11.239
So, what's up?

14:11.274 --> 14:14.942
Um, so I'm not applying
for the art school.

14:14.977 --> 14:17.411
- Really?
- No. Not right away.

14:17.446 --> 14:18.711
I just wanna take the time

14:18.747 --> 14:20.680
to get my portfolio in decent shape.

14:20.715 --> 14:22.582
And when it's ready, I'll transfer in.

14:24.253 --> 14:27.754
The thing is, the program
really frowns on that.

14:27.789 --> 14:30.390
They want students committed
to art from the beginning.

14:30.426 --> 14:32.926
There are a lot less
spots for transfers.

14:34.429 --> 14:36.606
Callie, if you want a real chance
of getting into the art school,

14:36.630 --> 14:37.796
you need to apply now.

14:47.007 --> 14:49.141
Hey! How was work?

14:49.177 --> 14:50.217
Oh, you know, another day,

14:50.244 --> 14:52.710
another pimp, another child prostitute.

14:54.381 --> 14:55.413
You okay?

14:56.683 --> 14:58.183
Yeah, somebody's gotta do it, right?

14:59.186 --> 15:00.518
Hey.

15:00.554 --> 15:02.019
It's alright.

15:02.055 --> 15:04.289
So, uh, I... I was looking online...

15:04.324 --> 15:06.824
Hold on. Sorry!

15:06.859 --> 15:08.792
Oh, it's a text from Tess.

15:09.861 --> 15:11.027
From Girl Bar?

15:11.063 --> 15:12.463
Ha ha.

15:12.498 --> 15:15.332
No, she and Dean are at
the airport going to Cabo.

15:15.367 --> 15:17.734
Would we mind checking
on Logan this weekend?

15:17.769 --> 15:19.403
That's interesting.

15:19.438 --> 15:23.607
Yeah. Maybe they're trying
to work out their issues.

15:23.642 --> 15:26.509
Maybe, but what about what
she said to you at prom?

15:26.544 --> 15:28.711
I don't think she's a lesbian, Lena.

15:28.746 --> 15:32.315
I think she's just having
a mid-life crisis maybe.

15:32.350 --> 15:33.983
Hey, bud! How was it?

15:34.018 --> 15:36.385
Hey! What'd you think of David?

15:37.388 --> 15:38.421
Um, he's fine.

15:38.456 --> 15:41.257
He's kind of annoying, though.

15:41.292 --> 15:42.668
Well, he's there to help you.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.003
You gotta have some patience with him.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.261
Isn't it his job to be patient with me?

15:46.296 --> 15:47.829
I'm sure he is.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.864
Give him a chance.

15:49.899 --> 15:52.834
So any outbursts or any
problems I should know about?

15:52.869 --> 15:54.636
No. It's fine.

15:54.671 --> 15:56.271
Great.

16:01.611 --> 16:04.378
So, uh, I was looking online,

16:04.413 --> 16:06.980
and I found a support
group for people with TBIs.

16:07.016 --> 16:09.283
So I though maybe it's
something we could do for Jesus.

16:09.318 --> 16:11.152
Yep, yep.

16:12.622 --> 16:14.455
Are you sure you're okay?

16:14.490 --> 16:17.423
Yeah! Yeah! I just... I just wanna
get out of all this, you know?

16:19.594 --> 16:20.726
Alright.

16:52.441 --> 16:56.097
- Hey!
- Oh! Hey! What are you...

16:56.107 --> 16:57.773
I was just gonna go for a run.

16:57.809 --> 16:59.249
Was wondering if you wanted to join.

17:00.044 --> 17:01.710
Oh, I... I can't.

17:01.745 --> 17:03.056
I have to email all of Anchor Beach

17:03.080 --> 17:04.423
and remind them of their humanity.

17:04.446 --> 17:05.686
Which, apparently, is for sale.

17:07.617 --> 17:09.050
Okay, cool.

17:09.086 --> 17:11.185
Well, I'll let you get to it.

17:11.221 --> 17:13.154
I, uh, just thought you should know

17:13.190 --> 17:14.521
that Olivia and I broke up.

17:15.892 --> 17:17.891
So you shouldn't be getting any more

17:17.926 --> 17:19.992
angry DMs from her, I hope.

17:20.996 --> 17:23.296
Oh, um... I'm sorry.

17:24.299 --> 17:25.898
You know, for the record?

17:25.935 --> 17:27.175
She had nothing to worry about.

17:27.203 --> 17:29.514
It's not like I was, like, trying
to get with you or anything.

17:29.538 --> 17:30.570
I know.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.941
But for the record...

17:33.976 --> 17:35.074
if you were...

17:36.410 --> 17:37.910
I wouldn't mind.

17:51.325 --> 17:52.591
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:54.227 --> 17:55.460
Grace happy to be home?

17:55.495 --> 17:58.163
Uh, yeah, I think she'd be happier

17:58.198 --> 18:00.098
if her mom didn't move in with her.

18:00.133 --> 18:01.800
Yeah, overbearing parents are the worst.

18:05.439 --> 18:07.984
Hey, Mom and I just wanted to tell
you that we're very proud of you.

18:08.008 --> 18:09.506
The way you are supporting Grace.

18:11.143 --> 18:12.476
But?

18:12.511 --> 18:13.778
No "but."

18:14.814 --> 18:16.180
And we want to make sure

18:16.215 --> 18:17.848
that you are supporting yourself.

18:17.884 --> 18:20.517
Okay? You really need to start
making a plan for next year.

18:20.553 --> 18:21.986
I'm not going to college, Mom.

18:22.021 --> 18:24.288
I want to spend as much
time as I can with Grace.

18:24.323 --> 18:26.089
I hear you, B.

18:26.124 --> 18:27.691
I do, but you're 18.

18:27.726 --> 18:30.426
And this is a lot.

18:30.462 --> 18:32.206
I mean, it's a lot for
Grace to deal with, you know?

18:32.230 --> 18:34.631
I'm not the sick one here.

18:34.666 --> 18:37.901
B, taking care of someone with
cancer, is incredibly stressful.

18:37.936 --> 18:41.471
And it's not always easy
to navigate. Just ask Mama.

18:45.977 --> 18:49.778
When I had my, um, my cancer scare...

18:49.814 --> 18:51.446
um...

18:51.482 --> 18:52.547
you know,

18:52.583 --> 18:54.950
I wasn't exactly feeling very...

18:54.986 --> 18:56.018
sexual.

19:01.257 --> 19:03.268
You know, it's not nice to
read over people's shoulders.

19:09.532 --> 19:11.298
Two guys in one day?

19:11.334 --> 19:12.934
You're practically the Bachelorette.

19:12.969 --> 19:14.335
I know, right!

19:14.370 --> 19:15.837
So, who gets the final rose?

19:15.872 --> 19:19.072
The charming, athletic boy next door,

19:19.108 --> 19:22.142
or the funny, quirky,
stoner blast from the past?

19:23.145 --> 19:24.544
I don't know.

19:24.579 --> 19:25.912
I mean, Logan's hot, but...

19:26.982 --> 19:28.414
look at this pineapple.

19:29.618 --> 19:30.684
It's a flower.

19:34.188 --> 19:36.088
Did you email the wrestling team?

19:36.124 --> 19:37.556
Just now.

19:38.893 --> 19:41.460
- What about Mat?
- Oh. Already sent.

19:41.495 --> 19:44.596
No, I mean, have you
talked to him since prom?

19:46.100 --> 19:48.167
I feel like I was just a pity dance.

19:48.202 --> 19:50.769
Like he's never gonna get
over the whole Nick of it all.

19:52.072 --> 19:54.139
Has he texted you again? Nick?

19:56.476 --> 19:58.509
- I texted him.
- Mariana, seriously?!

19:58.545 --> 20:00.289
Okay, just to find out if
he really knows something

20:00.313 --> 20:01.880
that can actually save the school.

20:01.915 --> 20:03.826
Of course he said he couldn't
tell me over the phone,

20:03.850 --> 20:05.028
so I'd have to see him in person.

20:05.052 --> 20:06.751
- Oh, come on!
- Don't worry.

20:06.787 --> 20:08.152
I'm not ever gonna text him again.

20:08.187 --> 20:09.953
I was just stressed about Anchor Beach.

20:13.425 --> 20:15.392
- Hey!
- Hey!

20:15.427 --> 20:16.860
How was the first day of school?

20:16.896 --> 20:20.230
Well, the only people who talked to me

20:20.265 --> 20:21.598
live in this house.

20:21.633 --> 20:23.233
Emma talks to you, doesn't she?

20:23.268 --> 20:25.267
Well, yeah, 'cause she's dating someone

20:25.303 --> 20:27.236
who lives in this house.

20:27.271 --> 20:29.416
Well, yeah, well, I mean, if
you wanna make more friends,

20:29.440 --> 20:31.808
then you should avoid
wearing the Yeti sweater.

20:34.345 --> 20:36.846
Yeah, it's... it's actually my dad's.

20:38.183 --> 20:40.917
Yeah, I... I found it at
the house today, and...

20:42.619 --> 20:43.885
It still smells like him.

20:45.155 --> 20:46.755
I'm sorry. I... I didn't...

20:46.790 --> 20:49.290
No, no, it's... it's okay.

20:56.366 --> 20:57.632
I just...

20:57.667 --> 21:00.367
I miss him so much.

21:03.606 --> 21:05.639
- Hey!
- Hey.

21:14.817 --> 21:17.050
She's just going through a lot.

21:17.085 --> 21:19.685
You know with her
sister and her parents.

21:19.721 --> 21:20.920
I get it.

22:00.329 --> 22:02.030
Um...

22:02.065 --> 22:03.497
I'm doing a still life.

22:05.001 --> 22:06.200
Of the toilet?

22:08.938 --> 22:10.837
Okay, I guess that's
a little less weird.

22:12.074 --> 22:14.875
Well, I just found out that my chances

22:14.910 --> 22:16.176
of getting into the art program

22:16.211 --> 22:18.745
are worse if I try and transfer in.

22:18.781 --> 22:22.315
So I only have two weeks
to finish my portfolio.

22:22.350 --> 22:25.150
Why would you transfer when you
can just apply for what you want?

22:25.186 --> 22:27.887
That's really easy for
you to say, Brandon.

22:27.922 --> 22:29.421
You've been a piano prodigy

22:29.457 --> 22:30.901
since you were, like, five years old.

22:32.193 --> 22:33.671
You gotta have more
confidence in yourself.

22:33.695 --> 22:36.395
Well, I've only been pursuing
art for, like, three months.

22:36.430 --> 22:37.496
So, I don't.

22:37.531 --> 22:39.531
- Yeah, but Callie...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

22:56.617 --> 22:58.048
That's all the ballots?

22:59.819 --> 23:02.019
Okay, let's get started.

23:49.866 --> 23:52.033
Jesus! Why aren't you in class?

23:53.036 --> 23:55.335
- What are you doing?
- Uh, nothing.

23:56.572 --> 23:58.673
Well, you're late. Let's go.

23:59.976 --> 24:01.042
Okay.

24:05.847 --> 24:08.281
Victim is aged 13.

24:08.316 --> 24:10.050
She had minor head wounds.

24:10.085 --> 24:11.685
Bruises on her back and legs.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.765
An ultrasound reveals
she's eight weeks pregnant.

24:13.789 --> 24:15.667
Of course, she's claiming that her pimp

24:15.691 --> 24:16.868
had nothing to do with any of this.

24:18.727 --> 24:19.859
Hey, everything alright?

24:21.496 --> 24:23.173
Yeah, I just... I left
my phone in the car.

24:23.197 --> 24:24.362
I'll catch up with you.

25:32.595 --> 25:33.840
Why don't you give that back to me

25:33.864 --> 25:35.296
by start of class tomorrow?

25:35.331 --> 25:38.299
- Okay. Sorry.
- Hey! No worries.

25:43.439 --> 25:44.773
- Sit down.
- What?

25:46.143 --> 25:47.841
You need to finish.

25:47.877 --> 25:49.910
He literally just said
that he's cool with it

25:49.945 --> 25:50.945
if I turn it in tomorrow.

25:50.980 --> 25:52.179
Well, I'm not cool with it.

25:53.182 --> 25:54.614
It... it's lunch. I'm hungry!

25:54.650 --> 25:56.116
We can get food in a little bit

25:56.152 --> 25:57.350
when you're done.

26:09.630 --> 26:12.698
Attention, everyone. We have
the results of today's vote.

26:12.733 --> 26:16.235
- Oh my God.
- The students have voted "no" to Anchor Beach Academy.

26:19.240 --> 26:20.439
Whoo!

26:24.878 --> 26:26.144
Congratulations.

26:28.415 --> 26:31.283
Board still has the final vote tomorrow.

26:31.318 --> 26:32.517
This isn't over.

26:32.552 --> 26:34.585
Yes, but with Monica Davis' vote,

26:34.621 --> 26:35.720
and the students' vote,

26:35.755 --> 26:36.922
we have enough to stop you.

26:38.858 --> 26:40.691
I guess you do.

26:40.726 --> 26:43.727
I understand you have a job
offer from Livingston Charter.

26:45.397 --> 26:46.931
Uh, yeah.

26:46.966 --> 26:49.333
The head of their
board, Maggie Thornton,

26:49.368 --> 26:52.102
she was my sorority sister at UCLA.

26:52.138 --> 26:54.571
Hmm. What was your point?

26:54.606 --> 26:57.740
Well, if you have one
foot out the door...

26:57.775 --> 26:59.442
your vote really shouldn't count.

26:59.477 --> 27:02.011
But it does until I resign.

27:02.047 --> 27:03.980
That's true.

27:04.015 --> 27:06.115
Although, I was thinking
of giving Maggie a call.

27:06.151 --> 27:08.017
Just to fill her in on some of the drama

27:08.053 --> 27:10.987
going on at Anchor Beach on your watch.

27:11.022 --> 27:13.588
I'm fairly sure the
offer will be rescinded.

27:13.623 --> 27:14.823
You'd really do that?

27:14.859 --> 27:17.625
Unless you resign
before the board meeting.

27:24.869 --> 27:27.435
If you leave, Drew gets your vote.

27:27.471 --> 27:29.104
Lena, I need that job.

27:47.339 --> 27:49.172
I want you.

27:49.207 --> 27:51.039
What if your mom gets back?

27:51.074 --> 27:53.108
I told you, she's gone for a while.

27:53.144 --> 27:54.676
Yeah, but how... how long?

27:54.711 --> 27:55.877
Long enough.

28:04.688 --> 28:07.188
Okay, not that long, Romeo.

28:07.223 --> 28:09.524
Let's just... let's just get to it.

28:12.228 --> 28:13.628
You okay?

28:13.663 --> 28:14.762
Yeah.

28:14.797 --> 28:16.930
No, I... I... I just...
I realized that I, uh...

28:16.966 --> 28:19.534
I have to get to work soon, so.

28:26.375 --> 28:27.707
- What?
- Nothing!

28:27.742 --> 28:30.777
You don't want to have
sex, we won't have sex.

28:30.812 --> 28:33.112
I don't not want to have sex with you.

28:33.148 --> 28:35.148
Just admit it. You're not
attracted to me anymore

28:35.184 --> 28:36.616
now that you know I'm sick.

28:51.899 --> 28:53.566
Jude!

28:53.601 --> 28:55.045
So chill to meet you, man. I'm Declan.

28:55.069 --> 28:57.369
Hey! I... I... I'm a big fan!

28:57.405 --> 28:59.014
I pretty much learned
how to play Eminent Power

28:59.038 --> 29:00.238
from watching your streams.

29:00.273 --> 29:02.873
They're, uh... really informative.

29:02.909 --> 29:03.941
Thanks.

29:03.976 --> 29:06.110
I mean, I... I kinda go for,
like, more cool and funny,

29:06.145 --> 29:08.346
- but that...
- No, no, no, they're that too!

29:08.381 --> 29:11.216
Uh, I love when you use
your cudgel against the Mage.

29:11.251 --> 29:12.495
And you yell, "By Grabthar's Hammer!"

29:12.519 --> 29:14.385
Yeah, that's, um...

29:14.421 --> 29:16.264
- It's actually...
- A "Galaxy"... "Galaxy Quest" reference.

29:16.288 --> 29:17.588
Totally!

29:18.591 --> 29:20.101
You know, I may have looked you up, too.

29:20.125 --> 29:22.259
You did some pretty cool
stuff with Vainglory.

29:22.294 --> 29:23.860
You and, uh, you and that girl.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.664
Taylor. Yeah.

29:29.735 --> 29:32.735
Grace, come on. How could
I not be attracted to you?

29:32.770 --> 29:35.738
Uh, maybe because you don't
want to have sex all of a sudden?

29:35.773 --> 29:37.172
We were just having sex!

29:40.411 --> 29:42.211
That was not sex, and you know it.

29:44.315 --> 29:45.814
Okay, I... I just... I...

29:45.850 --> 29:46.949
I don't want to hurt you.

29:48.386 --> 29:49.484
Don't flatter yourself.

29:50.487 --> 29:51.786
I'm not. I...

29:51.821 --> 29:53.388
I read something that...

29:53.423 --> 29:57.692
it... it said that, you know, it
can be an issue with... bleeding.

29:57.728 --> 29:59.160
I'm not some fragile thing

29:59.195 --> 30:01.663
that you're going to break, Brandon!

30:01.698 --> 30:04.110
This is exactly why I didn't
want you to know I was sick.

30:04.134 --> 30:06.067
Yes, but you are sick, and I do know.

30:06.102 --> 30:08.347
So if there's something that we
should or shouldn't be doing...

30:08.371 --> 30:10.437
Then I will tell you!

30:11.874 --> 30:13.974
I'm not gonna do anything
that doesn't feel good.

30:15.911 --> 30:17.210
Okay.

30:19.782 --> 30:20.814
Okay.

30:23.451 --> 30:26.085
Now let's do this thing
before my mom gets home.

30:35.497 --> 30:37.563
You know, my dad always said that

30:37.599 --> 30:40.399
Poppy and I were his American dream.

30:41.735 --> 30:43.735
That made me always want
to do my best, you know?

30:43.771 --> 30:47.306
Just to be worthy of the
sacrifices my parents made.

30:49.109 --> 30:50.409
I don't know how you do it.

30:50.444 --> 30:52.411
What?

30:52.446 --> 30:54.479
Just like the way you live.

30:54.515 --> 30:59.483
You're so unapologetic, and bold.

30:59.519 --> 31:03.554
Just yourself in the
face of all this shit.

31:03.589 --> 31:05.289
You have so much courage.

31:06.793 --> 31:09.727
I don't feel real courageous right now.

31:09.762 --> 31:11.462
I'm hiding out in a church.

31:13.165 --> 31:14.397
- Well, you should.
- Alright!

31:14.433 --> 31:16.399
Would you stop filming?

31:16.435 --> 31:17.467
Come skate with me.

31:22.974 --> 31:24.974
- This right here.
- Okay.

31:25.009 --> 31:27.544
So, what are you gonna do
about your UCSD application?

31:27.579 --> 31:30.012
Have you decided yet?

31:30.048 --> 31:31.113
I don't know.

31:32.149 --> 31:34.983
Do I play it safe and
go to the school I want?

31:35.018 --> 31:38.620
Or do I take a chance and
go for the major I want?

31:38.656 --> 31:40.556
Who says you can't get both?

31:40.591 --> 31:42.157
Yeah, but what if I get neither?

31:43.227 --> 31:46.495
Maybe I'm the wrong person to ask, but,

31:46.530 --> 31:48.830
my whole life is full of risk.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.865
So I say go for it.

31:50.900 --> 31:53.368
I don't have your confidence.

31:53.403 --> 31:54.602
I mean, not as an artist.

31:55.905 --> 31:57.545
You don't have to have confidence.

31:58.441 --> 31:59.741
Just courage.

31:59.776 --> 32:01.642
And you've got plenty of that.

32:01.678 --> 32:03.878
Trust me, girl.

32:03.913 --> 32:05.246
I know what it looks like.

32:10.919 --> 32:12.886
You are a natural, see?

32:12.921 --> 32:13.953
Oh my God.

32:16.625 --> 32:19.025
Listen, man, I don't know
about you, but, like...

32:19.060 --> 32:20.872
I'm good here. I think
Eminent Power was right.

32:20.896 --> 32:23.006
I think me and you are gonna
work really well together.

32:23.030 --> 32:24.864
So, uh, I'll keep doing my thing.

32:24.899 --> 32:27.299
And you can be, like,
the cute, nerdy sidekick.

32:33.240 --> 32:37.242
What would you do if you
wanted to do something

32:37.278 --> 32:40.177
but it meant you might lose a friend?

32:40.213 --> 32:41.913
Um...

32:41.948 --> 32:43.548
I... I'd pick my friend.

32:48.187 --> 32:50.154
That's why I'm not good here.

32:51.525 --> 32:53.991
That girl, Taylor?

32:54.027 --> 32:56.093
She and I started streaming together.

32:56.129 --> 32:58.228
And then Eminent Power approached me,

32:58.263 --> 32:59.730
but not her.

32:59.765 --> 33:02.433
And it just... it doesn't feel
right to do it without her.

33:02.468 --> 33:04.835
So I gotta...

33:06.204 --> 33:08.772
Yeah, okay, um...

33:08.808 --> 33:10.218
Then why don't we just
do it all together?

33:10.242 --> 33:12.309
We could be like a... like a "throuple."

33:12.344 --> 33:14.744
I already tried that.

33:14.779 --> 33:15.812
They said no.

33:15.847 --> 33:17.947
They won't say no to me.

33:17.982 --> 33:19.749
Trust.

33:19.784 --> 33:20.950
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:20.985 --> 33:22.985
I'm used to getting what I want.

33:26.458 --> 33:28.558
Hey, X? I'm gonna head out.

33:34.264 --> 33:35.330
What happened?

33:39.470 --> 33:41.102
My lawyer just called.

33:44.441 --> 33:47.741
Um, my DACA hasn't been renewed yet.

33:48.744 --> 33:50.578
And now it may never be.

33:50.613 --> 33:53.313
I mean, unless I get a special hearing.

33:54.717 --> 33:56.617
If I walk out of this building,

33:56.652 --> 33:58.686
I can be detained.

33:58.721 --> 34:02.690
Like I can't... I can't
live in this church forever.

34:02.725 --> 34:05.157
You're not gonna have to do that.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.293
We're gonna make sure of it.

34:09.697 --> 34:11.898
What if I never see my parents again?

34:18.438 --> 34:19.772
Hey.

34:21.942 --> 34:23.675
We're gonna figure this out, okay?

34:34.121 --> 34:36.056
- Hey.
- Hey!

34:38.193 --> 34:39.659
Congrats on saving the school.

34:40.696 --> 34:43.163
Well, it wasn't just me.

34:43.197 --> 34:44.630
Like I said at prom, you're...

34:44.666 --> 34:46.766
you're a force to be reckoned with.

34:46.801 --> 34:47.900
Thanks.

34:50.572 --> 34:52.692
There was something else I
wanted to tell you at prom.

34:53.641 --> 34:55.608
What's that?

34:55.643 --> 34:59.011
That I made a mistake.
Breaking up with you.

35:00.114 --> 35:02.747
I was a jerk, I was jealous,

35:02.783 --> 35:05.049
and insecure.

35:05.085 --> 35:06.117
Keep going.

35:06.152 --> 35:08.720
And I definitely should
have been more understanding

35:08.755 --> 35:10.355
about the whole Nick situation.

35:11.859 --> 35:13.057
True.

35:14.695 --> 35:15.994
I really miss you.

35:17.763 --> 35:22.432
Is there any way in hell
you'd give me another chance?

35:25.771 --> 35:27.571
Do I have to answer you now?

35:29.074 --> 35:30.741
No. No, not at all.

35:30.776 --> 35:32.376
Take all the time you need.

35:47.726 --> 35:49.592
_

35:49.628 --> 35:52.093
_

35:57.701 --> 35:58.734
I'm proud of you.

36:02.740 --> 36:03.805
What?

36:05.308 --> 36:07.009
Who was that girl yesterday?

36:08.211 --> 36:10.344
Um, the one on the motorcycle?

36:10.379 --> 36:12.914
I stopped by to try and talk, but...

36:12.949 --> 36:16.584
Oh, um... yeah. That
was my friend Gabriela.

36:17.921 --> 36:19.498
I mean, you have nothing to worry about.

36:19.522 --> 36:21.155
We're just friends, like, for real.

36:24.493 --> 36:26.192
It's fine.

36:26.227 --> 36:30.730
You know, I don't really
have a right to be worried.

36:32.601 --> 36:34.100
I'm the one who put the brakes on us,

36:34.135 --> 36:35.702
so we're just friends.

36:36.905 --> 36:39.439
You can date whoever you want.

36:40.576 --> 36:42.475
Well, I don't really
wanna date anyone else.

36:43.978 --> 36:46.779
Yeah, but, like, say you do.

36:46.814 --> 36:48.614
Like, down the road.

36:48.649 --> 36:50.449
I guess I'll have to tell you about it.

36:50.484 --> 36:52.985
I mean, friends are honest
with each other, right?

36:53.988 --> 36:55.588
Um, what if you meet someone?

36:56.724 --> 36:58.691
The whole point of us being friends

36:58.726 --> 37:02.259
is 'cause I don't think I should
be seeing anyone, like, right now.

37:04.698 --> 37:05.897
Can friends hug?

37:05.932 --> 37:07.932
- Is that allowed? Okay.
- Yeah!

37:10.704 --> 37:14.305
I had this, like, blowup with a friend

37:14.340 --> 37:17.040
over, like, nothing.

37:17.076 --> 37:21.377
We were playing a board
game and I totally lost it.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.313
This is pointless.
Can we get outta here?

37:23.348 --> 37:25.281
Please. Just give it a chance.

37:25.317 --> 37:28.218
I tried to explain that it wasn't me.

37:28.253 --> 37:31.287
That I sometimes, literally,
can't control my emotions,

37:31.323 --> 37:34.456
but people, and even my own family,

37:34.492 --> 37:38.227
who spent all those days
in the hospital with me,

37:38.262 --> 37:40.029
they still don't get it.

37:41.565 --> 37:43.198
Because I look fine,

37:43.234 --> 37:45.534
they think I should
be like I used to be.

37:45.569 --> 37:47.670
They don't understand.

37:47.705 --> 37:50.572
Because the disability
you have is invisible.

37:50.608 --> 37:54.042
So they think that you're
either being defiant,

37:54.077 --> 37:56.511
or not trying,

37:56.546 --> 37:59.948
or faking it to get off easy.

37:59.983 --> 38:03.484
They end up talking about
you behind your back.

38:03.520 --> 38:06.587
Not sharing stuff with you, because...

38:06.623 --> 38:08.488
they think that you can't handle it.

38:09.925 --> 38:13.694
It makes you feel even
more alone and isolated.

38:15.197 --> 38:19.366
Uh, I don't want to tell anyone

38:19.401 --> 38:21.535
when I don't understand things.

38:23.072 --> 38:27.339
Or when I forget where I parked my car.

38:27.375 --> 38:30.677
Which happens a lot!

38:33.548 --> 38:37.116
Sometimes I just...
wish I could fade away,

38:37.152 --> 38:38.517
because it's easier to be alone

38:38.553 --> 38:42.620
than it is to constantly
be misunderstood

38:42.656 --> 38:45.957
by the people I love the most.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.093
Honey?

39:10.783 --> 39:12.516
That's what we're
doing to you, isn't it?

39:17.622 --> 39:19.255
I know you guys don't mean to, but...

39:19.290 --> 39:20.990
Love, you don't have to say that.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.225
Okay?

39:24.562 --> 39:26.896
- We've been, uh...
- We've been doing this wrong.

39:29.067 --> 39:30.100
And I'm so sorry.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.135
We really thought we
were just helping you.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.772
I know. It's just...

39:36.807 --> 39:38.384
every time that you guys try to help me,

39:38.408 --> 39:40.042
it makes me feel like I... I...

39:40.077 --> 39:41.276
Like I can't do it,

39:41.311 --> 39:43.045
or like, I'm...

39:43.080 --> 39:45.547
I'm bad or I'm broken or something.

39:48.018 --> 39:50.251
Honey, you're not broken.

39:50.286 --> 39:52.720
You're not.

39:52.756 --> 39:55.522
And I promise you, that we're
gonna stop making you feel that way.

40:18.713 --> 40:20.446
So, there's really
nothing more we can do.

40:22.350 --> 40:24.349
So she's resigning?

40:24.385 --> 40:26.185
Well, she can't risk
losing that new job.

40:27.755 --> 40:30.422
Well, what about the
job she already has?

40:30.457 --> 40:32.992
What about her loyalty to
you and to Anchor Beach?

40:33.027 --> 40:34.471
Mariana, I'm really sorry, sweetheart.

40:34.495 --> 40:35.795
I know how hard you fought.

40:37.331 --> 40:38.363
So we lost?

40:39.400 --> 40:41.232
I mean, unless some board members

40:41.268 --> 40:42.628
change their mind before tomorrow.

41:04.201 --> 41:06.840
_

41:09.201 --> 41:11.201
_

41:26.644 --> 41:28.055
I understand you have some information

41:28.079 --> 41:29.445
that can save Anchor Beach.
