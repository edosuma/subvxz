00:16.760 --> 00:20.912
Mr President, my analysts believe Assad's
organisation cannot survive without him,

00:21.000 --> 00:23.878
and once he's dead, the attacks will stop.

00:23.960 --> 00:27.748
CTU needs to eliminate Assad.
That's all there is to it.

00:27.840 --> 00:30.229
God knows we're paying
a steep enough price to get him.

00:30.720 --> 00:33.518
We were contacted four days ago
by a man named Fayed.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.673
He offered to give us Assad's location for a
list of demands. One of them was Jack Bauer.

00:37.760 --> 00:41.799
We're asking you to sacrifice yourself
so we can eliminate Assad.

00:41.880 --> 00:46.749
The reason why I fought to stay alive in China
was because I didn't want to die for nothing.

00:46.840 --> 00:50.037
Today... I can die for something.

00:50.440 --> 00:53.113
You kept your end of the deal, I'll keep mine.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.509
I have a transponder at Assad's location.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.956
33-58-11 north latitude.

00:59.040 --> 01:02.589
118-21-40 west longitude.

01:02.680 --> 01:05.797
Have Bowen mobilise the helicopters.
I'll tell the president we're a go.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.749
CTU is about to kill the wrong man.

01:09.840 --> 01:13.355
Assad isn't behind these attacks.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.238
He's come here to stop them.

01:16.320 --> 01:20.199
He's come here... to stop... me.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.590
Get out of my house.

01:23.680 --> 01:27.593
- This kid's father's a terrorist.
- He's no more of a terrorist than you or me.

01:27.680 --> 01:31.434
- Tell me what happened.
- The FBI. They took my father.

01:31.520 --> 01:35.308
- Are you sure the FBI didn't find the package?
- Yes. It's well hidden.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.197
You need to deliver it soon.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.589
(flatline)

01:49.600 --> 01:51.795
(speaks Arabic language)

01:51.880 --> 01:55.077
Get in there! Find him!

02:07.160 --> 02:08.957
Wait.

02:09.039 --> 02:12.476
- We have to go.
- Not until we find Bauer.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.711
We're not here to kill one American,
we're here to kill thousands.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.268
But he knows the truth.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.316
It doesn't matter.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.278
By the time Bauer tells anyone,
it will be too late.

02:23.360 --> 02:28.036
Assad will be dead and we'll
be free to finish what we started.

02:29.120 --> 02:33.989
Fayed, listen to me. If we don't leave now,
we'll jeopardise the mission.

02:38.440 --> 02:39.919
All right.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.828
(man shouts in Arabic language)

03:14.000 --> 03:17.834
- This our target?
- This is where Fayed says Assad is now.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.797
- Heat signature?
- They're shielded.

03:19.880 --> 03:22.110
We can't tell how many are in there.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.794
If there's anyone in there at all.

03:25.800 --> 03:29.509
Fayed lied to us.
And Jack bought the farm for nothing.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.353
Shut up, Milo.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.191
What's her problem?

03:36.280 --> 03:39.078
Jack's a friend of hers.
It hurt her that he died that way.

03:39.160 --> 03:44.518
You might want to attenuate your
thoughtless remarks once in a while.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.559
Two Cobra attack helicopters
are being launched.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.835
They'll hit Assad's location in 15 minutes.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.433
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it?

04:07.520 --> 04:10.432
Jack Bauer's calling in. Line two.

04:11.760 --> 04:14.593
Jack, it's Bill. Thank God you're alive.
What happened?

04:14.680 --> 04:16.671
Listen. We do not have a lot of time.

04:16.760 --> 04:19.637
- I need you to call off the air strike.
- Why?

04:19.720 --> 04:23.872
You're going after the wrong man.
Assad is not responsible for the bombings.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.989
- Where did you get this information?
- I'll explain when you call it off.

04:29.080 --> 04:32.516
I don't have the power
to rescind a presidential order, Jack.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.398
- Put me through to the president. I'll tell him.
- Jack...

04:35.480 --> 04:38.552
Bill, trust me. Just put me through
to the White House.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.915
All right. Stay on the line.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.478
(woman) Bill Buchanan
for the president. Priority three.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.152
- Put him through.
- Yes, sir.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.549
- Bill?
- (Bill) There's new information

04:55.640 --> 04:57.551
regarding the air strike on Assad.

04:57.640 --> 05:00.950
I'm on the line with Jack Bauer.
He escaped from Fayed.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.918
What? How?

05:04.000 --> 05:08.232
I'm not sure, but he's requesting
that we abort the air strike against Assad.

05:08.320 --> 05:12.154
- For what possible reason, Bill?
- He says Assad is not behind the attacks.

05:12.240 --> 05:15.232
Bill, that's insane.
What is Jack basing this on?

05:15.320 --> 05:17.914
He wants to talk directly to the president.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.230
- Put him on.
- (Bill) You're on the line, Jack.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.038
- Mr President.
- Jack...

05:22.120 --> 05:25.192
We don't have a lot of time.
Did Bill explain about Assad?

05:25.280 --> 05:27.999
Yes, he has,
but we're all sceptical here.

05:28.080 --> 05:32.437
- What's Assad doing in this country?
- Trying to stop them, trying to stop Fayed.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.637
So you're saying that Fayed
is carrying out these bombings?

05:35.720 --> 05:39.679
Yes, sir. Fayed admitted to me
that Assad is planning to renounce terrorism.

05:39.760 --> 05:43.514
He's trying to mainstream his organisation,
bring them into politics.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.717
Fayed wants to stop that.
Fayed is behind these attacks.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.952
Jack, this is inconsistent with
20 years of terrorism on Assad's part.

05:51.040 --> 05:54.749
His organisation has waged
nonstop war against the West.

05:54.840 --> 05:57.115
He's responsible for hundreds of deaths.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.112
I am aware of Assad's history,
and I am still telling you

06:00.200 --> 06:04.079
that there is sufficient cause
to call off this strike.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.949
What if we change to a ground assault?

06:08.040 --> 06:10.873
Sir, we cannot afford a ground assault.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.428
We have to take him out
while we've got the chance.

06:13.520 --> 06:17.069
Mr President, if Jack is right,
it's a risk we have to take.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.072
Jack has been in
a Chinese prison for 20 months.

06:20.160 --> 06:23.709
His ability to assess this situation
is highly questionable.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.395
- I believe he's being played.
- I know what I heard. I am not being played.

06:27.480 --> 06:30.438
With all deference to Mr Bauer,
I think Karen is right.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.990
Mr President, if you wanna stop
these attacks, you need to stop Fayed.

06:34.080 --> 06:38.517
To do that, you need to capture Assad
and find out what he knows.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.831
Sir, he might be the only hope you have.

06:43.960 --> 06:47.953
Mr President, I know your history
with Mr Bauer runs deep,

06:48.040 --> 06:51.350
but don't let that impact yourjudgment here.

06:55.840 --> 06:59.276
We have the opportunity
to eliminate Assad. We have to take it.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.669
I want real-time progress
on that air strike.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.718
- I'm sending a video uplink.
- Mr President, don't do this.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.633
Jack, I am sorry.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.711
I am.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.636
Give me your location.
I'll send a unit.

07:17.720 --> 07:21.759
Killing Assad is a mistake. Right now,
he's your only chance of finding Fayed.

07:21.840 --> 07:25.150
It's the president's call.
We'll do all we can when you get back.

07:25.240 --> 07:29.233
- That'll be too late.
- Jack, tell me where you are.

07:55.120 --> 07:58.829
Don't put me on hold again.
Just give me the agent in charge.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.229
I will wait on the line.

08:01.320 --> 08:05.757
Dammit. She says they'll
call me back on this number.

08:05.840 --> 08:09.833
- Where are they holding my father?
- They cannot release that information.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.558
(phone rings)

08:11.640 --> 08:13.596
- Hello.
- (Fayed) You have the package?

08:13.680 --> 08:17.593
I'm at my friend's. They're helping me
find out where the FBI took my father.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.148
- You're not free to talk?
- No.

08:20.240 --> 08:23.232
Just tell me if you have the package.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.591
Not yet, but I'll have it soon.

08:26.680 --> 08:30.229
There are other people
I could have chosen for this task,

08:30.320 --> 08:32.515
but I chose you.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.797
Now get out of there. Retrieve the package.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.030
Call me when you have it.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.236
Yes. I will.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.953
I have to go back to my house.
I'm meeting my uncle.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.156
- Do you think that's wise?
- Are you sure?

08:47.240 --> 08:50.277
- (Scott) Ahmed, stay here.
- I'll be fine. Don't worry.

08:50.360 --> 08:53.796
- Thank you for everything. Thank you.
- OK. Take care.

08:53.880 --> 08:56.519
Don't worry. His family's
taking care of him now.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.114
Ahmed. Hold on.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.555
Listen, I'm sorry. I...

09:02.640 --> 09:06.997
I can't believe this is happening.
It's like the whole world has gone crazy.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.709
It's been crazy for a long time.
We just haven't been paying attention.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.791
Yeah, well, we are now.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.873
You know what, you should take this.

09:17.960 --> 09:22.272
I got this at a fair in Oregon.
It's supposed to mean good luck.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.194
Thanks, but I... can't take it.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.236
Why?

09:32.960 --> 09:36.077
You might need it yourself someday.

09:44.760 --> 09:48.548
- (man) Zebra One lead is cleared hot.
- (man #2) Zebra One is cleared hot.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.552
(man) Flight is cleared
for immediate engagement.

09:51.640 --> 09:54.438
- Buchanan.
- (woman) Please hold for Karen Hayes.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.838
- Bill?
- Yes, Karen?

09:56.920 --> 10:00.913
You're also online with the president.
We're monitoring the Cobras.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.355
- How soon before they hit?
- (woman) Five minutes.

10:03.440 --> 10:07.149
How soon after the strike can we expect
confirmation that Assad is dead?

10:07.240 --> 10:12.473
Curtis will lead a team into the target zone.
He'll do a point-by-point grid search.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.391
Thank you.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.675
(man)... request heading change.
One-five-zero.

10:39.520 --> 10:42.273
(man) Zebra One. Receiving southwest.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.113
3 minutes and 50 seconds to lock on target.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.235
(thudding)

11:36.880 --> 11:38.871
(muffled speech)

11:46.200 --> 11:50.239
(man) Changing course to one-eight-three
for southerly approach to target.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.595
(man #2) Roger, Zebra One. One-eight-three.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.796
(man) Lock in 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

12:00.040 --> 12:02.235
Drop the coffee.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.190
Don't move. Don't even think about it.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.271
Where is Assad?

12:10.360 --> 12:13.591
- Where is Assad?!
- Put down your weapon.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.591
- My name is Jack Bauer.
- I know.

12:15.680 --> 12:19.593
This house has been targeted for a strike.
I need to get you and your men out.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.477
Check the street.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.630
I came here alone.
I know about Fayed.

12:24.720 --> 12:28.474
- I know you're here to stop him.
- There's no one outside.

12:28.560 --> 12:32.473
Fayed has set you up. He provided CTU
with the coordinates to this house.

12:32.560 --> 12:35.518
- Kill him, Assad.
- In a few minutes, we'll all be dead.

12:35.600 --> 12:40.310
- Don't listen to him. It's a trap.
- There's a transponder in this house.

12:40.400 --> 12:44.632
- US military is using it to pinpoint the strike.
- There is no transponder here.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.678
We've searched the entire house.

12:53.600 --> 12:58.879
One of your men must have it on them.
That's the only possible explanation.

12:58.960 --> 13:02.430
One of your men is working for Fayed.
Have them empty their pockets.

13:02.520 --> 13:06.479
- Assad, don't listen to him. He's lying.
- Dammit, I am telling you the truth.

13:06.560 --> 13:10.075
Why else would I be here? If I wanted
to kill you, I'd have come in shooting.

13:10.160 --> 13:13.118
Have your men empty their pockets!

13:18.360 --> 13:21.113
I'm trying to save your life.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.317
Wait.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.193
- Empty your pockets.
- But...

13:31.280 --> 13:33.669
I said empty your pockets.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.910
Behind you!

13:38.000 --> 13:39.877
Search him.

13:52.800 --> 13:55.872
- You betrayed us.
- No.

13:55.960 --> 14:00.238
- You're the one who betrayed his people.
- Assad, we need to leave now.

14:00.320 --> 14:04.871
If you are telling the truth,
you will not need that gun.

14:07.720 --> 14:11.474
(man) Go, Assad. You need to leave.
We'll secure the files.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.630
(Assad) Hurry up.

14:22.520 --> 14:23.919
Move! Move!

14:33.640 --> 14:36.313
Are you all right? Get him up.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.799
Move.

14:40.560 --> 14:44.348
Mr President, the target has been destroyed.

14:58.760 --> 15:03.117
We are an advocacy group. These people
are all volunteers. They're very good people.

15:03.200 --> 15:08.320
I'm sure. We're assembling a database of
names to crosscheck against our watch list.

15:08.400 --> 15:12.234
- (woman) Excuse me, Sandra. The FBI's here.
- FBI?

15:12.320 --> 15:16.199
They're asking for access
to our personnel records.

15:17.280 --> 15:21.398
(man) We take pride in being good citizens,
and will cooperate to stop the attacks.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.756
May I see your warrant, gentlemen?
I'm Mr Al-Rezani's attorney.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.628
- I also represent this organisation.
- We know who you are, ma'am.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.075
And I'm afraid we don't have a warrant.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.993
I'm afraid we can't
turn over our personnel records.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.390
That information is private,
and privacy is protected by law.

15:37.480 --> 15:40.711
I understand, but in light
of what's happening in the country,

15:40.800 --> 15:43.951
we don't think it's unreasonable
to ask for cooperation.

15:44.040 --> 15:47.157
You're in the wrong place.
There are no terrorists here.

15:47.240 --> 15:52.394
So unless you have a warrant,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.190
Please don't make me ask twice.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.795
All right, ma'am.

16:04.840 --> 16:09.277
- This is getting out of hand.
- Maybe we should give them what they want.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.510
- You're serious?
- We've nothing to hide.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.670
No, but we have something to protect -

16:13.760 --> 16:16.320
the privacy of everyone
who's ever worked here.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.836
Maybe we have to sacrifice privacy.
The country's under attack.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.956
We cannot pretend it isn't.

16:22.040 --> 16:25.237
- Who are you calling?
- Yes, it's Sandra Palmer.

16:25.320 --> 16:28.153
I'd like to speak with my brother.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.958
We're sweeping the zone.
We've recovered four bodies.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.077
Forensics is running field ID.
They're sending data to CTU.

16:37.160 --> 16:40.072
- Well, let's hope one of them is Assad.
- (phone beeps)

16:40.160 --> 16:42.720
- Yes?
- (woman) The president's sister on the line.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.394
- He'll wanna call her back.
- She says it's urgent.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.675
- I'll take it.
- Mr President, we're...

16:47.760 --> 16:51.230
Tom, it's OK.
Let me have the room, please.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.233
- What's going on, Sandra?
- I'm sorry, but I think you need to know.

17:09.319 --> 17:15.111
The FBI was just here, and they
wanted access to the IAA's personnel records.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.909
- Did they say why?
- Some excuse about expanding a database.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.915
Listen, Sandra. I...

17:25.280 --> 17:28.477
You know I have to do whatever I can
to stop these attacks, right?

17:28.560 --> 17:29.390
Yes.

17:29.480 --> 17:34.110
That includes giving law enforcement
the authority to follow up every single lead.

17:34.200 --> 17:37.078
That's my point.
They weren't following any lead.

17:37.160 --> 17:41.153
They were invading a group of people's
privacy based on their religion.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.471
Look, Wayne, you know
I'm not some idealistic flag burner,

17:44.560 --> 17:47.711
and I understand you're going through
a complicated situation,

17:47.800 --> 17:52.430
but once you start ethnic profiling,
it's a slippery slope.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.954
- I'll look into it.
- Start with Tom Lennox.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.032
- This has his name written all over it.
- Don't start in on Tom.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.396
He treats the Constitution
like a list of suggestions.

18:01.480 --> 18:05.473
He's laying the framework for a crackdown,
and civil protections be damned.

18:05.560 --> 18:08.233
Let's be honest,
you don't like Tom and you never have.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.515
Neither did David.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.516
(phone beeps)

18:17.600 --> 18:20.717
- Yes?
- (woman) Bill Buchanan's on the line.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.109
One moment. Sandra, I gotta go.

18:23.200 --> 18:26.351
Wayne, look,
I'm sorry to put this on you, OK?

18:26.440 --> 18:31.150
I... I just wouldn't have called
if I didn't think it was important.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.708
I understand.

18:33.800 --> 18:37.349
- You take care of yourself, OK?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I love you too.

18:42.560 --> 18:47.111
- I hope I got through to him.
- You made a good case. He'll listen.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.151
Thanks.

18:55.240 --> 18:58.232
- For what?
- For making that call.

18:58.320 --> 19:01.949
And for not letting me
lose sight of what we're fighting for.

19:05.360 --> 19:08.352
- (Palmer) Go ahead.
- We completed our sweep of the zone.

19:08.440 --> 19:12.115
- Four bodies. None of them is Assad.
- What?

19:12.200 --> 19:16.239
- (Karen) Are you sure?
- We're checking, but I think Assad is alive.

19:16.320 --> 19:19.198
- How did we miss him?!
- Someone must have warned him.

19:19.280 --> 19:23.034
Or the intel from Fayed was bad,
and Assad was never there to begin with.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.839
Irrelevant. What matters
is that Assad is out there.

19:25.920 --> 19:30.152
We're sealing a ten-block perimeter
around the area. Assad may be in the vicinity.

19:30.240 --> 19:33.152
All right, Bill.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.629
We put everything we had into that strike.

19:35.720 --> 19:40.748
We thought if we could cut off the head
we could stop these attacks, and now...

19:42.520 --> 19:46.115
Tom, what do you think
Assad's next move is gonna be?

19:46.200 --> 19:50.637
Likely, there will be more attacks,
but respond he will, guaranteed.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.953
- (Fayed) Ahmed will have the package soon.
- Good.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.349
- Is he ready?
- Yes. He is waiting for you.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.829
(speaks Arabic language)

20:51.840 --> 20:54.229
That's not necessary.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.788
I will not fail you.

20:59.160 --> 21:02.470
I don't question your devotion, Nasir.

21:03.160 --> 21:08.996
When the moment approaches,
even the most devout can experience fear.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.750
Look at me.

21:12.960 --> 21:16.839
By overcoming your fear,
you prove your worth.

21:22.800 --> 21:26.349
I am proud to have
known you in this life, Nasir.

21:26.440 --> 21:29.557
Your family will learn about your sacrifice.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.795
(man) All right. One more load.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.951
Let's go.

22:17.960 --> 22:19.837
Put him here.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.191
He's unconscious.

22:26.280 --> 22:30.193
CTU's gonna realise you weren't killed.
They'll widen their search grid.

22:30.280 --> 22:34.239
- We can't stay here much longer.
- He knows where Fayed is.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.709
I only need a few minutes.

22:38.080 --> 22:43.074
Fayed told me that you wanted to disarm. You
were gonna start negotiations. Is that true?

22:43.160 --> 22:46.994
Most of my people and the governments
that support us agreed to a cease-fire.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.196
- Fayed wants to sabotage it?
- Yes.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.999
Once Fayed is eliminated,
everyone will fall into line

22:52.080 --> 22:54.150
and I can go public with my proposal.

22:54.240 --> 22:57.630
But finding Fayed
is the key to everything.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.475
I'll be right back.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.276
Buchanan.

23:24.360 --> 23:28.638
I know why Assad wasn't in the building
when the missile hit. I need to show you.

23:38.840 --> 23:43.277
This is an aerial frame enhancement of the
building seconds before it was destroyed.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.715
Jack rescued Assad.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.438
OK, OK.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.431
This makes sense...

23:51.520 --> 23:55.479
from Jack's perspective,
if Assad is trying to stop the bombing.

23:55.560 --> 23:59.519
But President Palmer and your wife -
I mean, Karen Hayes - think he's wrong.

23:59.600 --> 24:02.478
So what am I supposed to do with this?

24:02.560 --> 24:04.630
- Who else has seen it?
- Nobody but me.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.915
OK. Let's keep it that way for now.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.958
Jack didn't save Assad
out of compassion.

24:10.040 --> 24:13.669
- He's gonna use him to find Fayed.
- We should be looking for Fayed too.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.796
Right.

24:15.880 --> 24:19.111
Filter the chatter stream,
see if anything sources out on Fayed.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.430
- OK.
- Good work.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.277
We have a car.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.712
If we're gonna find Fayed in time,
we have to involve CTU.

24:33.800 --> 24:36.155
The people who tried to kill me
and killed my men?

24:36.240 --> 24:41.553
- They have resources you don't.
- They will question me for days.

24:41.640 --> 24:44.837
Fayed worked under me.
I know how he thinks, and I will find him,

24:44.920 --> 24:48.117
but I will do it on my terms.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.955
- Where is Fayed?
- I do not know.

24:54.040 --> 24:57.350
- Where is he?!
- I was just ordered to plant the transponder.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.036
- Where is Fayed?
- I do not know.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.109
Please stop.

25:19.840 --> 25:20.909
Please.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.835
Why did you stop?

25:27.920 --> 25:30.434
I can see it in his eyes.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.954
He's not gonna tell us anything.

25:54.240 --> 25:56.310
Where is Fayed?

25:56.400 --> 26:01.190
I know where some of his men will be.
I heard Fayed giving instructions to go there.

26:01.280 --> 26:03.635
Where?

26:03.720 --> 26:06.996
- Figueroa and Sixth.
- When?

26:07.080 --> 26:09.878
After you were killed.

26:12.840 --> 26:15.593
- You've told me everything?
- Yes.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.194
I swear it.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.391
I swear it.

26:23.640 --> 26:25.835
I believe you.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.630
I understand...

26:31.720 --> 26:34.598
how you felt you were doing the right thing.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.274
I admire your conviction,

26:38.200 --> 26:40.668
but you have taken the wrong path.

26:43.640 --> 26:45.756
I'm sorry.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.351
Let's go.

26:59.840 --> 27:02.957
My men are dead. I can find Fayed.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.634
But I cannot stop him by myself.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.834
I don't know how to do this any more.

27:11.560 --> 27:14.074
You'll remember.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.872
- (phone rings)
- Hello?

27:30.960 --> 27:35.351
You'd better come out here.
The FBI is back. They have a warrant.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.038
Who is the applicant for this?
I wanna see the affidavit.

27:45.120 --> 27:50.478
The papers are on file with a district court.
We have a legally executed warrant.

27:50.560 --> 27:54.314
Either you hand over the files,
or we take them. It's your choice.

27:54.400 --> 27:58.279
This is an administrative warrant.
It's not valid in this situation.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.237
That's your opinion.

28:04.480 --> 28:07.711
They're in the media room.

28:07.800 --> 28:10.075
I'll show you.

28:18.520 --> 28:21.114
I need to use your computer.

28:22.320 --> 28:26.950
Malek, I need copies
of all of our personnel files.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.829
OK. No problem.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.591
(computer beeps)

28:53.880 --> 28:56.838
- What is it?
- I can't find the files.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.588
Are you certain? Try again.

29:02.680 --> 29:04.636
- They're not here.
- What do you mean?

29:04.720 --> 29:07.951
- They're not where they're supposed to be.
- They've been erased.

29:08.040 --> 29:10.793
Don't try to recall them.
I used the shredding program.

29:10.880 --> 29:14.156
- Sandra, what are you doing?
- Check it.

29:18.720 --> 29:21.314
She's telling the truth.

29:21.400 --> 29:25.791
You're under arrest. Obstructing
official business, destroying evidence.

29:25.880 --> 29:29.668
- Take Mr Al-Rezani into custody.
- Wait. He has nothing to do with this.

29:29.760 --> 29:33.958
- That's the judge's call.
- But I'm telling you, he's not involved.

29:38.920 --> 29:41.480
Are you sure about this?

29:41.560 --> 29:46.554
- I told you, she gets no special treatment.
- I know, but she's the president's sister.

29:46.640 --> 29:49.632
We have orders handed down,
and we're gonna follow them.

29:49.720 --> 29:53.713
Impound every work station
and hard drive in this office.

30:16.400 --> 30:19.392
Think I forgot about you, huh?

30:23.840 --> 30:26.912
This is for everyone
you bastards killed today.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.993
How do you like it, huh?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.434
Get up. Get up!

30:37.360 --> 30:41.069
You're dead, do you hear me? You're dead.

30:54.920 --> 30:58.117
Please. Don't. Please. Don't.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.714
(shouts in Arabic language)

31:16.120 --> 31:17.917
Ahmed.

31:19.040 --> 31:20.837
What happened?

31:22.880 --> 31:24.677
What happened?

31:29.640 --> 31:33.155
- I'm gonna call an ambulance.
- We're not calling anybody.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.549
- Ahmed...
- I can't go to the hospital.

31:35.640 --> 31:38.518
- You're hurt. I'm gonna call 911.
- (cocks gun)

31:41.440 --> 31:43.874
You shouldn't have come here, Scott.

31:44.920 --> 31:49.152
Look, I don't wanna hurt you,
but I will unless you do exactly what I say.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.755
Ahmed... we're friends.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.400
What friends?

31:56.480 --> 31:59.040
You can't even pronounce my name.

32:00.320 --> 32:04.552
It's not Ahmed, it's Ach-med.

32:23.880 --> 32:24.995
This is the location Omar gave us.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.991
Over there.

32:31.080 --> 32:35.995
Two men in suits, one carrying a briefcase.
These are Fayed's men.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.958
The man in front
is wearing an explosive vest.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.759
He's setting up another strike.

32:45.440 --> 32:47.271
Go.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.869
They're going in the subway.

33:35.960 --> 33:39.509
(Assad) The detonator is in his right hand.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.956
- They can't get on that train.
- Only the bomber is getting on.

33:43.040 --> 33:47.591
The other man is the handler.
He'll see the bomber off, then he'll leave.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.989
The handler will lead us to Fayed.

33:50.080 --> 33:53.356
You follow the handler.
I'm going after the bomber.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.716
(dials phone)

35:12.720 --> 35:14.631
(phone rings)

35:17.800 --> 35:19.153
- Go ahead.
- He's on a train.

35:19.240 --> 35:21.754
It will reach Union Station
in five minutes.

35:21.840 --> 35:25.992
- When it pulls in, he'll martyr himself.
- The car is at the arranged place. Take it.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.548
Go to Union Station.
Call me when it's done.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.631
Understood.

35:57.760 --> 35:59.751
Thank you.

36:00.240 --> 36:01.832
Ticket.

36:06.160 --> 36:09.232
Ticket, please.

36:17.720 --> 36:18.709
Ticket.

36:20.760 --> 36:24.753
- Sir, do you have a ticket?
- My name is Jack Bauer. I am a federal agent.

36:24.840 --> 36:30.039
You have a terrorist on this train with a bomb.
I need you to walk away.

36:30.120 --> 36:34.432
If he notices anything unusual,
he will detonate his bomb. Now move away.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.714
(shouting / screaming)

37:25.720 --> 37:28.154
(man) It's a bomb!

37:34.800 --> 37:36.836
Allahu Akbar!

38:26.080 --> 38:28.389
(woman) As the wave of violence continues...

38:28.480 --> 38:30.471
(phone rings)

38:31.480 --> 38:33.357
- Talk.
- Fayed, something went wrong.

38:33.440 --> 38:36.398
I'm here at Union Station,
but there's no explosion.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.313
And there's a cloud of smoke
four blocks west from here.

38:43.840 --> 38:47.310
Whatever the case, it doesn't matter.

38:47.400 --> 38:50.676
Our other attacks were successful.

38:50.760 --> 38:53.877
Once again, the streets
are flowing with blood.

38:57.480 --> 39:01.189
Three simultaneous bombings.
One in a shopping mall, another in a hotel.

39:01.280 --> 39:04.238
- Casualties are high.
- What about the third one?

39:04.320 --> 39:06.550
I'll call you back.

39:06.640 --> 39:10.474
It was here. On the Metro Red Line.
It appears to be a suicide bomber.

39:10.560 --> 39:13.916
May be some good news. Aside from
the bomber, no one else was killed.

39:14.000 --> 39:18.471
- How the hell could that happen?
- A passenger ejected the bomber.

39:18.560 --> 39:21.632
The passenger
identified himself as Jack Bauer.

39:23.000 --> 39:28.916
If Jack was on that train, he'll have been
caught on camera. I want visual confirmation.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.468
- Yes, sir.
- Sir, you need to hear this.

39:31.560 --> 39:34.597
It's a cellphone call
red-tagged from the NSA software.

39:34.680 --> 39:37.831
Fayed, something went wrong.
I'm here at Union Station...

39:37.920 --> 39:39.717
We need to contact the White House.

39:39.800 --> 39:43.190
(man on TV) The car bomb
was detonated by remote control,

39:43.280 --> 39:46.352
sending bodies hurling out of windows
from the 20th floor...

39:46.440 --> 39:48.670
Mr President, if it's any consolation,

39:48.760 --> 39:51.718
these attacks were planned
in advance of the raid on Assad.

39:51.800 --> 39:54.598
Tom, all that means is
there will be more attacks.

39:54.680 --> 39:57.513
We're in a full-blown war,
and we have no way to fight back.

39:57.600 --> 40:00.319
Excuse me. Mr President.

40:02.360 --> 40:06.194
CTU just called.
They intercepted a cellphone call

40:06.280 --> 40:10.592
between Fayed and one of the men
behind today's bombings.

40:10.680 --> 40:12.591
Fayed?

40:12.680 --> 40:14.159
Are they sure?

40:14.240 --> 40:16.435
Yes, sir.

40:16.520 --> 40:20.308
Fayed is the one
behind these attacks, not Assad.

40:24.200 --> 40:28.478
Sir, I promoted the strike against Assad.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.028
But I approved it, Karen.

40:31.120 --> 40:33.918
We were all in agreement.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.510
So Jack was right.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.468
He was right all along and I...

40:46.400 --> 40:48.789
This is gonna get much worse.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.877
(ringing tone)

41:06.960 --> 41:08.951
(phone rings)

41:12.720 --> 41:14.119
- Yeah.
- What happened?

41:14.200 --> 41:16.236
Later. Are you following the handler?

41:16.320 --> 41:20.393
Yes. I'm in the car. We're on Alameda,
two blocks from Union Station.

41:20.480 --> 41:24.837
Copy that. I'll find you. Stay with the handler.
He's our only connection to Fayed.
