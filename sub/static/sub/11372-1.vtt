03:03.797 --> 03:05.697
Thankyouforthe horse.

03:07.067 --> 03:08.261
You liked him?

03:08.301 --> 03:09.768
Oh, it's beautiful...

03:12.372 --> 03:14.431
but l thought
we were going sailing today.

03:19.646 --> 03:21.204
You promised.

03:29.055 --> 03:30.818
Well,that one's too old.

03:37.264 --> 03:39.459
See, now? That'll do.

03:41.401 --> 03:42.891
Come on!

03:42.936 --> 03:44.870
Come on, Mr. E.

03:48.174 --> 03:50.802
-lt's broken.
-Who says?

03:52.012 --> 03:53.172
Mokelock.

03:54.948 --> 03:56.313
Now, Edward,we agreed.

03:56.349 --> 03:58.374
No more Mokelock.

03:58.418 --> 04:00.147
Mokelock is the bogeyman.

04:02.188 --> 04:04.213
Mokelockwants me where l am.

04:04.257 --> 04:06.418
We canfix it.

04:13.266 --> 04:14.426
Edward.

04:57.243 --> 04:59.302
Sing a song of sixpence.

05:02.282 --> 05:04.250
Sing a song of sixpence.

05:05.452 --> 05:07.579
A pocketfull of rye.

05:20.166 --> 05:22.259
Four and twenty blackbirds.

05:23.403 --> 05:25.428
Baked in a pie.

05:42.188 --> 05:44.122
Rise and shine.

05:56.236 --> 05:58.363
Mr. E is doingfine.

06:05.045 --> 06:06.410
Did we go sailing?

06:08.915 --> 06:11.179
Almost.

06:11.217 --> 06:13.048
Mokelock showed up.

06:13.086 --> 06:15.646
Mokelock is the bogeyman.

06:15.689 --> 06:17.384
Mokelockwants me where l am.

06:17.424 --> 06:20.951
Mokelock is a pain in the ass.

06:22.028 --> 06:24.326
Where'd he get Mokelock again?

06:24.364 --> 06:25.592
Mother Goose.

06:28.034 --> 06:29.228
-Henry.
-Barry.

06:29.269 --> 06:31.464
What's the matter, Barry?

06:31.504 --> 06:33.734
Edward's parents are here.

06:47.087 --> 06:48.679
He needs a haircut.

06:50.056 --> 06:51.921
He loves itwhen you visit.

06:53.026 --> 06:55.426
My husband
wonders if that's true.

06:57.564 --> 06:59.759
He wants to place Edward
in the hospital.

07:01.201 --> 07:02.361
l'm sorry, Catherine.

07:04.771 --> 07:06.033
Mr. Baines...

07:07.440 --> 07:11.069
l've been working
on this projectfor seven years.

07:11.111 --> 07:14.376
l know, Henry. l know.

07:16.916 --> 07:19.612
Please don'ttake offense,
Dr. Kent.

07:19.652 --> 07:22.212
Yourwork's invaluable
to this company.

07:22.255 --> 07:24.086
Butyou're not sure about me.

07:24.124 --> 07:28.083
We've waited eighteen months
for signs of progress.

07:28.128 --> 07:30.221
There has been progress.

07:30.263 --> 07:32.595
There's no proof, Catherine.

07:32.632 --> 07:34.361
With all due respect,
Mr. Baines...

07:35.502 --> 07:37.197
l'm notthe one
who designed the procedure.

07:38.938 --> 07:40.872
l mean, l wish l could take
creditfor it, but l can't.

07:41.908 --> 07:45.036
l was chosen to do a job.
They picked me.

07:46.212 --> 07:47.941
But if you think
there's someone better...

07:51.451 --> 07:53.248
or someone who's more devoted
to your son,then--

07:53.286 --> 07:55.151
No one's doubting your ability,
Catherine.

07:55.188 --> 07:56.746
What is it,then?

07:56.790 --> 07:58.655
There's no proof, Catherine.

07:58.691 --> 08:02.092
There's no proof
the procedure works.

08:02.128 --> 08:04.028
All you're giving me
is the belief...

08:04.063 --> 08:06.793
thatyour interaction
with my son...

08:06.833 --> 08:08.323
is not a...

08:09.869 --> 08:11.166
hallucination.

09:57.610 --> 09:58.770
Shit!

10:22.435 --> 10:23.925
l better get backto work.

10:23.970 --> 10:25.631
Oh, good-bye, Mrs. Baines.

10:25.672 --> 10:28.539
-Thankyou.
-Thankyou, Mr. Baines.

10:29.409 --> 10:31.468
Come, shall we? Lucien.

10:39.953 --> 10:41.284
Lucky she worships you.

10:41.321 --> 10:43.687
Why? Because he hates me?

10:43.723 --> 10:45.987
l wouldn't say ''hates.''

10:46.025 --> 10:48.994
Distrusts,
dislikes immensely...

10:49.028 --> 10:50.996
can't bearthe sight of.

10:55.201 --> 10:56.691
What's the verdict?

10:56.736 --> 10:58.829
Well,we've got
another six months...

10:59.973 --> 11:01.838
and Barry had to pushforthat.

11:04.844 --> 11:06.903
l wantto reverse thefeed,
Miriam...

11:06.946 --> 11:08.607
now more than ever.

11:09.849 --> 11:11.578
We've been through this
a hundred times, Catherine.

11:11.617 --> 11:13.244
lt's too risky.

11:13.286 --> 11:15.277
Why not?
What do we have to lose?

11:15.321 --> 11:18.085
When l did social work,
itwas always better...

11:18.124 --> 11:20.592
when we tookthe kids
out of their environment.

11:22.328 --> 11:24.091
Foster homes
can be scary atfirst...

11:24.130 --> 11:26.860
but eventually they see
thatthings can be different.

11:26.899 --> 11:29.094
Edward is like that right now.

11:29.135 --> 11:34.630
He--he's living in a world
that is not healthy.

11:34.674 --> 11:36.608
Let's show him
a different place.

11:36.642 --> 11:39.110
All right.
Let's say we do ityourway.

11:39.145 --> 11:43.104
We reverse thefeed, and
we bring Edward into your mind.

11:43.149 --> 11:45.242
Can you imagine his shock
when hefinds...

11:45.284 --> 11:47.275
that he's been thrust
into this whole otherworld?

11:47.320 --> 11:51.279
-l do it all the time.
-You're a willing participant.

11:51.324 --> 11:53.292
You're aware
of what's happening.

11:53.326 --> 11:55.191
Edward's in a coma.

11:55.228 --> 11:58.595
And besides,we don't know
what effect itwill have on you.

11:58.631 --> 12:01.566
l mean,
you're already exhausted.

12:01.601 --> 12:03.569
-Have you been sleeping?
-Yes.

12:03.603 --> 12:05.594
-Any more nightmares?
-No.

12:08.074 --> 12:10.634
-No.
-Good.

12:10.676 --> 12:12.200
Leave work here.

12:12.245 --> 12:14.076
Don'ttake it home in this.

13:23.316 --> 13:24.647
Hey,you.

13:26.786 --> 13:29.254
What are you lookingfor, hmm?

13:29.288 --> 13:30.812
Want some milk?

13:50.943 --> 13:53.878
That'sfun. Let me try it.

13:57.116 --> 14:00.483
Not so much power.
The animal is delicate.

15:02.415 --> 15:03.905
Edward, is thatyou?

15:03.950 --> 15:08.148
Edward,were there seagulls
being killed on the beach...

15:08.187 --> 15:10.087
while you were sailing?

15:10.122 --> 15:13.819
Don't hide, sweetie, please?
Edward, is thatyou?

15:13.859 --> 15:16.020
Don't be afraid.

15:16.062 --> 15:18.496
No one will hurtyou.

15:18.531 --> 15:20.590
Edward, is thatyou?

15:24.103 --> 15:26.936
Go to sleep.

15:32.411 --> 15:33.935
Help!

15:35.348 --> 15:38.283
Somebody, help me, please!

15:40.286 --> 15:42.686
Somebody!

15:45.091 --> 15:46.581
Help me!

15:57.436 --> 15:58.960
Can you hear me?

15:59.005 --> 16:01.371
Help!

16:50.856 --> 16:52.255
Thanksforwaiting, Cole.

16:52.291 --> 16:54.088
Teddy Lee, no problem.

16:54.126 --> 16:56.185
Special Agent Ramsey.

16:56.228 --> 16:57.661
-Cole.
-Morning.

17:00.132 --> 17:01.963
Whofound her?

17:02.001 --> 17:04.696
The surveyorforthe railroad,
about 6:00 this morning.

17:04.737 --> 17:08.468
Skidmarks appearto match
the tire tracksfrom Reno.

17:08.507 --> 17:11.670
And it looks like he scraped
the rail and lost some paint.

17:11.711 --> 17:13.234
lt's on its way to the lab
already.

17:15.381 --> 17:17.281
Dumped the body overthere.

17:33.833 --> 17:34.993
Bleach.

17:36.102 --> 17:37.626
Anne Marie Vicksey.

17:37.670 --> 17:39.137
She makes seven.

17:39.171 --> 17:40.934
Jeez,this stinks.

17:42.508 --> 17:43.566
Do they all look like dolls?

17:43.609 --> 17:45.907
Every unfortunate soul.

17:47.413 --> 17:48.675
What's that?

17:48.714 --> 17:53.117
Some kind of a collar.
Part of his methodology.

17:53.152 --> 17:54.312
The way he puts itthere?

17:56.255 --> 17:57.847
He makes itforthem.

17:57.890 --> 18:00.120
lt makes himfeel
they belong to him.

18:02.962 --> 18:04.554
ls the water always this low?

18:13.205 --> 18:15.173
Yeah,this time of year.

18:15.207 --> 18:17.437
Give me a coroner's report
right away.

18:17.476 --> 18:19.569
Preliminaryforensics,too.

18:19.612 --> 18:22.080
l don'twant anyone
dragging their ass on this.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.757
So, how was work?

18:36.796 --> 18:38.058
Oh, exhausting.

19:16.602 --> 19:19.070
l have no idea,Jean.
For God's sake.

19:20.105 --> 19:22.630
Good luckwith the monster.
l love you,too. l gotta go.

19:22.675 --> 19:24.973
-OK. Thanks. Bye.
-All right. Bye-bye.

19:28.948 --> 19:30.415
Hot off the presses.

19:34.487 --> 19:37.012
There's nothing new to report,
gentlemen.

19:38.190 --> 19:40.090
A match on his semen.

19:40.125 --> 19:42.616
Water in her lungs...

19:42.661 --> 19:45.994
show high levels
of chlorine and rust.

19:50.636 --> 19:53.161
What, pray tell, is this?

19:53.205 --> 19:55.503
They say theyfound
some dog hair?

19:58.177 --> 19:59.610
From a canine unit?

19:59.645 --> 20:01.237
No. There was no canine unit.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.612
And Anne Vicksey
doesn't own a dog,Teddy.

20:05.284 --> 20:07.115
l wantto see this.

20:12.057 --> 20:13.684
Whatyou got,Teddy?

20:27.473 --> 20:30.101
Hypomelanosis.

20:32.144 --> 20:33.577
And that means?

20:37.449 --> 20:40.145
A complete absence of melanin.

20:42.054 --> 20:44.488
The dog is an albino.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.858
He'd love an animal like that.

20:49.895 --> 20:51.419
Gentlemen...

20:51.463 --> 20:57.095
l believe an albino dog
is a rare animal indeed.

21:54.093 --> 21:55.788
Oh, my God.

21:59.665 --> 22:01.189
Oh, my God.

22:03.102 --> 22:04.729
You poor boy.

22:04.770 --> 22:06.397
You're gonna be OK.

22:06.438 --> 22:08.269
Baby, l'm so sorry.

22:40.372 --> 22:41.999
Jesus Christ, Peter.

22:43.575 --> 22:45.805
Thoughtyou were gonna get
some sleep, clean yourself up.

22:47.146 --> 22:48.306
l did.

22:49.848 --> 22:51.941
-They're waiting,you know.
-l'm ready.

22:54.820 --> 22:56.151
Let's go.

22:59.958 --> 23:01.983
We're gonna do this two ways.

23:02.995 --> 23:04.428
Breeders of German shepherds.

23:05.798 --> 23:06.958
Ford dealers.

23:10.602 --> 23:13.400
l wantyou to be thorough,
and l also wantyou to befast.

23:13.439 --> 23:15.202
This guy's accelerating.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.538
He only waited six days
this time.

23:17.576 --> 23:20.511
When hefirst started,
months could pass.

23:20.546 --> 23:23.447
And that means
one of two differentthings.

23:23.482 --> 23:26.940
One, he thinks we're stupid,
and we can't catch him.

23:27.953 --> 23:30.751
Two,which is the one
that l believe...

23:30.789 --> 23:32.654
he wants to be caught.

23:34.093 --> 23:36.254
The dog hairthing is sloppy.

23:36.295 --> 23:39.753
He leaves Anne Marie Vicksey
in three inches of water.

23:39.798 --> 23:41.732
He knew thatwe'dfind her.

23:41.767 --> 23:44.395
Now,there's one thing
l knowfor certain.

23:45.637 --> 23:47.537
lf we can't stop him...

23:49.742 --> 23:51.767
he ain't gonna stop himself.

24:08.227 --> 24:09.717
Will this be all right?

24:11.163 --> 24:13.495
Yes, ma'am,that's great.
Thankyou very much.

24:14.566 --> 24:16.033
She was still
living at home, ma'am?

24:18.103 --> 24:20.094
We were looking through
apartments.

24:20.139 --> 24:21.572
Butthey're not
moving in together...

24:21.607 --> 24:24.075
until afterthe wedding.

24:24.109 --> 24:25.576
Julia wants to be married.

24:25.611 --> 24:28.409
Did she ever mention anything
out of the ordinary?

24:28.447 --> 24:30.540
For instance,
somebody she was seeing mad...

24:30.582 --> 24:33.574
or somebody perhaps watching her
orfollowing her?

24:36.088 --> 24:37.248
Pardon me.

24:39.291 --> 24:40.451
Ramsey.

24:42.361 --> 24:44.795
What if you made a mistake?

24:44.830 --> 24:46.923
Maybe this isn'tthe man.

24:46.965 --> 24:48.660
Maybe Julia's safe.

24:51.270 --> 24:53.067
There's certain things
that he does...

24:53.105 --> 24:57.337
that make us pretty positive
thatthis is the man.

24:57.376 --> 25:01.073
Lastyear,
l lost my husband to cancer.

25:02.281 --> 25:03.805
l wentthrough
such terrible pain.

25:03.849 --> 25:06.647
ButJulia,
she was always therefor me.

25:14.626 --> 25:15.854
What's going on, Gordon?

25:15.894 --> 25:19.227
Riverside sherifffound
a dog breeder in Woodcrest.

25:19.264 --> 25:20.663
Three years ago,
she had a buyer...

25:20.699 --> 25:23.031
for an albino shepherd pup.

25:23.068 --> 25:24.558
Sheriff checks D.M.V.

25:24.603 --> 25:27.800
Son of a bitch
drives a '92ford pickup.

25:27.840 --> 25:30.001
-Guess what color.
-Aquamarine.

25:41.320 --> 25:42.719
Ramsey!

25:42.754 --> 25:44.585
-Novak!
-Where is it?

25:44.623 --> 25:46.853
Edison,
just east of Loma Park.

25:46.892 --> 25:48.484
S.W.A.T.'s had the house
under surveillance...

25:48.527 --> 25:49.960
for abouttwenty minutes.

25:49.995 --> 25:51.758
Carl Rudolph Stargher.

25:51.797 --> 25:53.765
No registered weapons,
no priors.

25:53.799 --> 25:55.596
Got a licensefor his dog,
though.

25:55.634 --> 25:57.499
Named him Valentine.

26:22.494 --> 26:25.588
You're the bad man,
aren'tyou, Carl?

26:34.973 --> 26:38.909
Mairzy doats and dozy doats

27:48.013 --> 27:51.312

Agent Ramsey,Agent Novak.

27:51.350 --> 27:54.217
We got here asfast as we could.
l briefed them on the way over.

27:54.252 --> 27:56.243
Where do we stand?

27:56.288 --> 27:57.778
Here's the situation.

27:58.890 --> 28:01.188
We got a high-ground team
on the roof...

28:01.226 --> 28:03.126
afour-man elementto the east.

28:03.161 --> 28:05.925
We got an entry team in the van
acrossfrom the house...

28:05.964 --> 28:07.989
a two man elementto the south.

28:08.033 --> 28:09.227
Have you seen him yet?

28:10.202 --> 28:12.693
No. There's been some movement
in the kitchen.

28:12.738 --> 28:14.433
Can'ttell what it is.

28:14.473 --> 28:16.839
-You thinkthe girl's in there?
-We'll assume she is.

28:39.231 --> 28:41.392
-FBl!
-Go!

28:41.433 --> 28:43.025
Freeze, motherfucker!

28:59.951 --> 29:01.509
l gotthe dog!

29:01.553 --> 29:04.113
-Clear.
-Clear.

29:39.724 --> 29:41.624
They'll take him
to County General.

29:41.660 --> 29:43.389
Reid's already there.

29:43.428 --> 29:44.725
Make sure he stays cuffed.

29:44.763 --> 29:47.254
l wanttwo men on him
at all times.

29:47.299 --> 29:49.233
l don'twant anyone to treat him
but Reid.

29:49.267 --> 29:51.667
Not so much as a thermometer
up his ass, understand?

29:55.474 --> 29:56.805
She's not here.

29:59.711 --> 30:01.838
You should come downstairs.

31:12.817 --> 31:13.943
Mommy!

31:13.985 --> 31:17.443
Please take care
of my little baby!

31:37.609 --> 31:40.476
Please, are you there?
Hello?

31:41.479 --> 31:44.141
Please hear me.

31:44.182 --> 31:45.809
Can you hear me?

31:51.189 --> 31:53.851
l need something.

31:53.892 --> 31:56.326
l need you...

31:56.361 --> 31:58.329
Anybody here?

32:01.099 --> 32:04.091
This is not happening to me.

32:04.135 --> 32:08.231
This is definitely
not happening.

32:08.273 --> 32:10.332
Please help!

32:25.023 --> 32:27.218
Have you ever heard
of Whelan's infraction?

32:28.660 --> 32:30.560
lt's aform of schizophrenia.

32:30.595 --> 32:33.155
lt's very rare,
and it's very severe.

32:34.199 --> 32:36.099
ln any schizophrenic...

32:36.134 --> 32:37.931
these areas would be affected...

32:37.969 --> 32:40.437
but in someone with Whelan's...

32:40.472 --> 32:42.099
they're hit hard,
and they're hitfast.

32:42.140 --> 32:44.370
Can'tyou load him up
with thorazine or doxepin?

32:44.409 --> 32:47.469
Normal psychotropics don'twork.

32:47.512 --> 32:49.207
This thing
is caused by a virus...

32:49.247 --> 32:52.444
that infects the neurological
system in utero.

32:52.484 --> 32:53.917
lt lays dormant...

32:53.952 --> 32:57.115
until it's triggered
by some kind of trauma.

32:57.155 --> 32:59.453
Most likely, he's exhibited
symptomsfor some time...

32:59.491 --> 33:01.891
butthe infraction,
orthe breach...

33:01.926 --> 33:03.518
didn't occur until today.

33:04.929 --> 33:06.089
The triggers can vary.

33:06.131 --> 33:10.033
Uh, usually water-related,
butthe results don'tvary.

33:11.403 --> 33:13.963
He's notjust catatonic.

33:14.005 --> 33:15.165
He's disappeared--

33:16.441 --> 33:19.001
like having a dream
and neverwaking up.

33:19.044 --> 33:20.875
For how long?

33:22.113 --> 33:23.512
Oh,forever.

33:28.953 --> 33:31.421
Lee, l thinkwe might be missing
the bigger picture here.

33:31.456 --> 33:34.220
Now,whatever state
that he happens to be in...

33:34.259 --> 33:36.489
there is a girl
that is missing...

33:36.528 --> 33:39.088
and her name is Julia Hickson...

33:39.130 --> 33:42.622
and he is the only one
that knows where she is.

33:42.667 --> 33:45.431
He keeps them in this thing...

33:45.470 --> 33:47.700
for aboutforty hours.

33:47.739 --> 33:51.539
Now, he tookJulia Hickson
at 7:30 last night.

33:51.576 --> 33:54.238
Peter,you know me.

33:54.279 --> 33:57.476
lf there were
anything, anything...

34:04.989 --> 34:06.183
What?

34:38.822 --> 34:40.585
He provides them withfood...

34:40.625 --> 34:43.560
drinking water, and a toilet.

34:45.964 --> 34:47.659
Now, she thinks
she's been kidnapped...

34:47.699 --> 34:49.826
thatthere's a chance
of survival...

34:49.868 --> 34:52.166
but it's just aform of torture.

34:53.538 --> 34:54.766
This is a kind of ritual
for him--

34:54.806 --> 34:57.103
a cleansing
before he takes them home...

34:57.141 --> 35:00.509
and turns them into a doll,
a toy.

35:03.047 --> 35:04.844
Now,this thing
isfully automated...

35:06.251 --> 35:08.048
and unless wefind her
by tonight...

35:09.888 --> 35:11.048
this will happen to her.

35:13.158 --> 35:14.420
Atthe request
of Mr. Cooperman...

35:14.459 --> 35:17.360
we've contacted
your board of directors...

35:17.395 --> 35:19.056
and they've given
their approval.

35:21.332 --> 35:23.766
And so have Edward's parents.

35:23.802 --> 35:25.827
Butthe decision is yours.

35:35.814 --> 35:36.940
lt's upto Catherine.

35:36.981 --> 35:39.245
She's the one
who would have toface...

35:39.284 --> 35:41.081
whatever risks there might be...

35:41.119 --> 35:44.520
so, l support
whatever decision she makes.

35:46.291 --> 35:47.553
Can l askyou something?

35:47.592 --> 35:49.560
Please.

35:49.594 --> 35:50.891
lf he wasn't like this...

35:50.929 --> 35:52.760
if he was conscious...

35:52.797 --> 35:56.358
do you thinkthat he would
tell you where she is?

35:57.569 --> 36:00.504
There's always a chance
of a confession. Yeah.

36:00.538 --> 36:03.063
And there's things he's done
that show a needfor disclosure.

36:04.209 --> 36:06.074
He hasn't had a sympathetic ear.

36:06.110 --> 36:10.479
He wants someone to listen,
to try and understand him.

36:10.515 --> 36:13.211
Look,
lfeelforthis girl, l do...

36:13.251 --> 36:17.085
but Stargher
may no longer know the truth.

36:17.121 --> 36:18.383
For severe schizophrenics...

36:18.423 --> 36:21.051
there's no discerning
betweenfantasy and reality.

36:21.092 --> 36:22.582
ls it possible?

36:22.627 --> 36:25.494
lf he came to trust me,yes...

36:25.530 --> 36:27.498
but ittakes months to earn
that kind of trust.

36:27.532 --> 36:29.762
ls it possible?

36:36.508 --> 36:38.533
Daddy?

36:40.044 --> 36:41.875
Come here...

36:41.913 --> 36:44.279
and save me! Save me!

36:53.758 --> 36:56.886
l'm daddy's girl.

37:14.779 --> 37:16.440
His levels are tooflat.

37:23.221 --> 37:25.086
What happened here?

37:25.123 --> 37:27.751
We removedfourteen steel rings.

37:32.764 --> 37:34.755
Should have left him
the way he was.

37:36.034 --> 37:38.025
He used to suspend himself,
didn't he?

37:40.405 --> 37:43.067
They're comforted by
thefeeling of weightlessness...

37:43.107 --> 37:45.098
likefloating in water.

37:50.415 --> 37:53.578
Now,this, gentlemen,
is the catalyst.

37:53.618 --> 37:56.712
The neurological connectic
transfer system...

37:56.754 --> 37:59.052
not only maps the mind...

38:00.258 --> 38:02.192
it sends the signal
to another party.

38:02.226 --> 38:04.353
All you need to do is tune in...

38:04.395 --> 38:07.558
butyou do much more
than tune in.

38:07.599 --> 38:09.464
You become part of the show.

38:14.606 --> 38:15.766
He's ready.

38:22.113 --> 38:23.808
Why are there three stations?

38:23.848 --> 38:26.043
For a while,we tried
jointtherapy sessions--

38:26.084 --> 38:27.551
two shrinks
forthe price of one--

38:27.585 --> 38:30.213
but Edward hated it
and only talked to Catherine.

38:30.254 --> 38:31.983
She has a gift.

38:48.406 --> 38:49.634
Are you sure?

38:53.378 --> 38:54.845
l'm sure.

38:54.879 --> 38:56.938
OK.

39:05.256 --> 39:07.816
Response signal...

39:07.859 --> 39:08.985
functioning.

39:09.027 --> 39:12.963
We implanted a touch-sensitive
microchip in her hand...

39:12.997 --> 39:15.022
so if she wants
to stopthe session...

39:15.066 --> 39:17.933
or if it gets too intense,
she can give the signal...

39:17.969 --> 39:19.368
and we abort.

39:32.717 --> 39:36.710
When we were ready
for practical testing...

39:36.754 --> 39:38.585
Miriam and l auditioned...

39:38.623 --> 39:40.887
some of the best child
therapists in the country.

39:40.925 --> 39:45.225
And all they did was observe
and report, nothing more.

39:46.698 --> 39:48.222
Catherine
was the least experienced...

39:48.266 --> 39:51.133
but she came
so highly recommended...

39:51.169 --> 39:53.967
thatwe decided,whatthe hell,
we'll give her a shot...

39:54.005 --> 39:56.030
and immediately,
we could tell she was different.

41:47.151 --> 41:49.346
You're not human.
You don't lie in my house.

41:49.387 --> 41:51.082
You're an animal!

43:08.332 --> 43:09.594
Hey,you.

43:19.810 --> 43:21.869
Yeah,you like that, don'tyou?

43:24.615 --> 43:26.242
ls your name Carl?

43:27.985 --> 43:30.419
You know, l know another
little boy with a horse.

43:30.454 --> 43:31.853
His name's Edward.

43:31.889 --> 43:34.221
l mean the boy, notthe horse.

43:55.513 --> 43:57.208
What's wrong?

45:01.645 --> 45:02.805
His victims.

47:50.648 --> 47:52.240
Where you comefrom?

48:07.131 --> 48:08.826
Gentlemen, she's back.

48:08.866 --> 48:10.197
l'll be rightthere.

48:23.247 --> 48:25.238
All right. Come on, Catherine.

48:28.786 --> 48:31.380
She's had quite a journey.

48:31.422 --> 48:33.447
Unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

48:33.490 --> 48:36.050
-So she's made contact?
-Oh,yes.

48:36.093 --> 48:38.425
She's gone very deep
into his world.

48:38.462 --> 48:39.588
Attimes toofar.

48:39.630 --> 48:41.393
lt's cold.

48:41.432 --> 48:43.559
That can be dangerous.

48:43.601 --> 48:44.863
What are you talking about?

48:44.902 --> 48:48.861
Well, if she came to believe
that Stargher's world is real...

48:48.906 --> 48:52.273
then theoretically, her mind
could convince her body...

48:52.309 --> 48:54.903
that anything
thatwas done to itthere...

48:54.945 --> 48:56.845
is actually done.

48:56.880 --> 48:59.747
lt's like the old wives' tale
where you die in your dream...

48:59.783 --> 49:01.341
you die in real life.

49:01.385 --> 49:04.411
Henry, could you raise
the temperature in here, please?

49:04.455 --> 49:06.582
-Dr. Kent?
-Just a moment, please.

49:06.624 --> 49:08.524
Dr. Kent, can l come in there
and speakwith you?

49:08.559 --> 49:10.356
We have to be patient.

49:10.394 --> 49:12.862
l mean, look at her.
She's drowsy.

49:12.896 --> 49:14.193
Let herwake up.

49:14.231 --> 49:17.689
We don't have a lot of time.
Do you understand that?

50:05.549 --> 50:08.916
Ourfather,
who art in heaven...

50:08.952 --> 50:10.943
hallowed be thy name.

50:22.032 --> 50:23.659
Am l interrupting anything?

50:32.309 --> 50:34.106
ls it OK if l...

50:47.057 --> 50:49.116
He knows you're here,
doesn't he?

50:52.730 --> 50:55.665
Myfriend Dr. Reid said...

50:57.301 --> 50:59.531
that it's very unusual--

50:59.570 --> 51:01.367
schizophrenia,that is--

51:03.006 --> 51:05.531
in a child that's this young.

51:05.576 --> 51:08.067
They usually think it's autism.

51:08.112 --> 51:09.443
Whatyou have to understand...

51:09.480 --> 51:11.141
is there's nothing wrong
with his body.

51:12.182 --> 51:14.309
What's paralyzed
is a part of his mind.

51:14.351 --> 51:16.444
lt's so damaged by the virus...

51:16.487 --> 51:18.751
he can't even will himself
to move.

51:20.624 --> 51:22.592
You thinkyou can change that?

51:22.626 --> 51:24.958
Do you believe
there's a part of yourself...

51:26.563 --> 51:28.030
thatyou don't show anybody?

51:29.032 --> 51:31.125
l think everybody
has that side of themselves.

51:31.168 --> 51:33.193
During a session,
when l'm inside...

51:34.905 --> 51:36.532
l getto see those things.

51:37.875 --> 51:39.342
lfeel them.

51:41.311 --> 51:44.974
With Stargher, lfeltthings
l neverwanttofeel again.

51:48.519 --> 51:51.386
He's not even
Carl Stargher anymore.

51:51.422 --> 51:54.482
He's this idealized version
of himself--

51:54.525 --> 51:57.756
a king
in a very,very twisted kingdom.

51:57.795 --> 52:01.253
The placefor him
to indulge every...

52:03.333 --> 52:05.528
You know, l don'twantto talk
aboutthis in here.

52:20.451 --> 52:22.749
l could never do whatyou do--

52:22.786 --> 52:25.880
devote myself to understanding
a mind like that.

52:26.890 --> 52:30.417
l don'tthinkwe'll ever be able
to understand a mind like that.

52:30.461 --> 52:32.053
Butyou try. That's yourjob.

52:33.297 --> 52:34.457
l guess so.

52:35.432 --> 52:37.662
You don't like whatyou do?

52:37.701 --> 52:40.169
l like it better
than my old job.

52:40.204 --> 52:43.139
Used to be an attorney.
l was a prosecutor.

52:43.173 --> 52:45.164
What happened?

52:46.643 --> 52:48.907
l had a case, um...

52:48.946 --> 52:51.710
where this little girl
was molested.

52:52.816 --> 52:56.411
And because of this
one tiny piece of evidence...

52:56.453 --> 52:59.251
thatwas tainted, he walked.

52:59.289 --> 53:03.020
Uh, Charles Gish walked away.

53:04.628 --> 53:06.220
Nothing l could do about it.

53:07.931 --> 53:10.593
The night after
he was released...

53:11.702 --> 53:14.000
Margaret's parents came home--

53:14.037 --> 53:15.971
thatwas
the little girl's name--

53:16.006 --> 53:17.268
Margaret Sims.

53:18.775 --> 53:22.211
And theyfound Charles Gish
sitting in their living room.

53:22.246 --> 53:23.873
He was watching television...

53:23.914 --> 53:26.212
and Margaret
was sitting nextto him...

53:26.250 --> 53:29.947
and he had cut her open
right down the middle.

53:32.089 --> 53:35.252
The parentsfound
Margaret's heart in thefreezer.

53:36.760 --> 53:39.228
Charlesfigured
they'd probably wantto keep it.

53:41.732 --> 53:43.427
Afterthat, l leftthe D.A...

53:43.467 --> 53:46.300
and joined the FBl.

53:47.638 --> 53:50.072
Figured l'd justtry
to catch 'em.

53:51.842 --> 53:53.332
Till now.

53:57.147 --> 53:58.614
You know,
l started to tell you...

53:58.649 --> 54:01.948
that Stargher
really isn't Stargher anymore.

54:01.985 --> 54:03.816
Well,that's true, and it's not.

54:03.854 --> 54:07.722
The dominant side
is still this horrible thing...

54:07.758 --> 54:10.056
butthere's
a positive side that--

54:10.093 --> 54:11.219
Positive side?

54:11.261 --> 54:13.525
Well,the way he sees himself
as a child.

54:13.564 --> 54:15.862
But isn'tthat him?

54:15.899 --> 54:19.494
The boy Stargher made contact.
He's curious about me.

54:19.536 --> 54:21.094
lf l could reach the boy...

54:21.138 --> 54:24.164
then maybe he'd tell me
aboutJulia.

54:29.046 --> 54:31.207
Whatever happened
to Charles Gish?

54:32.349 --> 54:34.078
Old Charlie
beatthe murder rap...

54:34.117 --> 54:37.553
because he was insane
when he killed Margaret.

54:38.555 --> 54:43.515
His attorney milked the jury
for all they were worth.

54:43.560 --> 54:49.089
Said that a life of sexual abuse
drove him to do these things...

54:49.132 --> 54:50.895
and,you know,
whateverthefuck.

54:50.934 --> 54:52.595
All that same old bullshit.

54:53.937 --> 54:56.565
Why is that bullshit?

54:56.607 --> 54:58.404
l believe
a child can experience...

54:58.442 --> 55:02.003
a hundred times worse the abuse
than what Gish wentthrough...

55:02.045 --> 55:03.910
and still grow upto be...

55:03.947 --> 55:08.543
somebody thatwould never, ever,
ever hurt another living being.

55:10.053 --> 55:11.247
And you're sure of that?

55:13.190 --> 55:14.680
Yes, l am.

55:16.860 --> 55:18.487
l'm sure of that.

55:21.932 --> 55:23.422
Hey,where the hell you been?

55:24.701 --> 55:26.293
l've been right here.

55:26.336 --> 55:28.804
Well, nexttime tell me, OK?

55:28.839 --> 55:31.103
l didn'twantto disturbyou.
You looked so cute,you know?

55:31.141 --> 55:33.166
You're all sleeping when you get
that look on you.

55:35.846 --> 55:39.009
Your colleagues wantto know
whatto do with Stargher.

55:45.288 --> 55:48.519
Tell them to prep him.
l'll be rightthere.

55:52.362 --> 55:53.829
Thankyou, Catherine.

55:59.503 --> 56:03.166
Stargher have any pets?
You know, cats, dogs...

56:09.880 --> 56:12.781
Yeah,you're a good boy,
aren'tyou,Valentine?

56:12.816 --> 56:14.943
That's supposed to help?

56:14.985 --> 56:16.953
On a subconscious level,yes.

56:16.987 --> 56:20.616
Anything thatwas special to
Stargher, gave him pleasure...

56:20.657 --> 56:23.251
should make him
more accessible...

56:23.293 --> 56:25.124
more peaceful.

56:25.162 --> 56:26.322
Peaceful?

56:28.632 --> 56:30.497
Nice little pup.

56:40.477 --> 56:42.536
-Mr. Novak.
-Doctor.

56:42.579 --> 56:43.739
Thankyou.

56:47.484 --> 56:49.145
Round two.

57:03.533 --> 57:05.728
Hey, notfunny.

57:11.942 --> 57:13.773
Come on, stop playing around.

57:13.810 --> 57:16.711
l'm not. lt's a power problem.

57:16.747 --> 57:18.442
We're locked out, Catherine.

57:18.482 --> 57:21.110
l--l need you to check
the circuit breaker.

57:21.151 --> 57:24.450
l wantyou to check
circuits six through twelve.

57:26.957 --> 57:28.083
Come on.

57:28.125 --> 57:29.319
Get up.

57:31.428 --> 57:33.919
Six through twelve.

58:26.716 --> 58:27.876
l'm already in.

58:29.586 --> 58:31.247
What did she say?

59:45.462 --> 59:47.054
Come here, boy.

01:00:01.611 --> 01:00:03.238
Can you take me to Carl?

01:00:43.053 --> 01:00:44.486
Need some help?

01:00:49.326 --> 01:00:51.021
l've got a presentforyou.

01:00:54.497 --> 01:00:56.829
lf you need me...

01:00:56.866 --> 01:01:00.097
or if youfeel like l'm around
butyou can'tfind me...

01:01:00.136 --> 01:01:01.296
just...

01:01:02.672 --> 01:01:04.367
Shine it like this.

01:01:08.611 --> 01:01:09.839
Go ahead,take it.

01:01:12.882 --> 01:01:15.009
You like it?

01:01:15.051 --> 01:01:17.212
-Carl?
-What's the matter?

01:01:18.254 --> 01:01:19.721
What?

01:01:19.756 --> 01:01:20.984
What's wrong?

01:01:24.394 --> 01:01:25.986
What happened over here?

01:01:26.029 --> 01:01:27.690
Just broke all by itself.

01:01:29.399 --> 01:01:32.334
-Did you breakthat plate?
-l broke the plate.

01:01:32.369 --> 01:01:35.930
-Did you breakthat plate?
-l broke the plate.

01:01:35.972 --> 01:01:37.496
Well, hey, let's...

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:39.667
Let's break 'em all,
how aboutthat?

01:01:39.709 --> 01:01:41.506
You littlefucking liar!

01:01:42.512 --> 01:01:44.844
l should've drowned you
like the runt of the litter.

01:01:44.881 --> 01:01:46.542
You don't lie in my house.

01:01:46.583 --> 01:01:48.175
This is my house!

01:01:54.924 --> 01:01:56.551
-He's just a boy.
-Shut up!

01:01:56.593 --> 01:01:59.084
You're not his mother!

01:01:59.129 --> 01:02:01.256
She's notyour mother.

01:02:01.297 --> 01:02:04.357
She left us, Carl.
Rememberthat.

01:02:06.302 --> 01:02:07.496
See that?

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:24.481
Wait. Jesus Christ!

01:02:24.521 --> 01:02:27.115
Whatthefuck is this?
Get back--Get over here!

01:02:28.158 --> 01:02:31.150
Playing with dolls?
You littlefaggot!

01:02:31.194 --> 01:02:32.593
God!

01:02:32.629 --> 01:02:33.755
What are you,
some kind of a woman?

01:02:33.797 --> 01:02:35.264
-Get up!
-But, dad--

01:02:35.298 --> 01:02:37.596
Damn it.
You want something to cry about?

01:02:37.634 --> 01:02:41.161
l'll give you something
to cry about,woman!

01:02:41.204 --> 01:02:42.364
Mama's boy!

01:02:43.606 --> 01:02:44.766
l didn't raise nofaggot!

01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:55.510
Stopyour crying.

01:02:55.552 --> 01:02:56.678
You wantto iron like a woman?

01:02:56.719 --> 01:02:59.187
-Let me show you how to iron.
-No!

01:03:03.293 --> 01:03:04.783
Help me.

01:03:34.891 --> 01:03:36.051
See?

01:03:37.327 --> 01:03:39.352
She was myfirst.

01:03:42.765 --> 01:03:44.960
l made such a mess.

01:03:46.202 --> 01:03:48.261
Now what l have to do...

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.883
Why are you here?

01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:09.023
Don't lie.

01:04:11.895 --> 01:04:14.921
-l came to helpyou.
-You're lying.

01:04:14.964 --> 01:04:16.829
Bitch.

01:04:16.866 --> 01:04:18.356
Whore.

01:04:20.737 --> 01:04:21.897
Cunt!

01:04:24.574 --> 01:04:26.804
You sound like yourfather.

01:04:29.946 --> 01:04:33.040
He was nothing.

01:04:33.082 --> 01:04:36.574
He is nothing.

01:04:36.619 --> 01:04:39.087
Who told you to say that?

01:04:39.122 --> 01:04:42.785
Do you rememberthefirsttime
he talked to you?

01:04:42.825 --> 01:04:45.350
Were you in water?
Maybe you went swimming.

01:04:48.431 --> 01:04:51.400
ltwas my baptism.

01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:55.935
Myfather, he...

01:04:55.972 --> 01:04:57.872
he pushed me under.

01:05:01.578 --> 01:05:04.240
l think l had
some kind of seizure.

01:05:06.082 --> 01:05:08.141
l think l was drowning...

01:05:08.184 --> 01:05:11.278
and everybody just looked at me.

01:05:14.958 --> 01:05:17.392
Nobody helped me. Nobody.

01:05:19.362 --> 01:05:20.954
Except him.

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.827
Myfather...

01:05:25.868 --> 01:05:27.995
he took me home that night...

01:05:28.037 --> 01:05:33.168
and he broke three of my ribs...

01:05:33.209 --> 01:05:36.201
andfractured my jaw.

01:05:38.314 --> 01:05:41.181
l was six years old.

01:05:45.855 --> 01:05:48.346
Whatyourfather did to you
is evil.

01:05:50.193 --> 01:05:52.525
What he did to you was wrong.

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:57.097
He treated you like a thing.

01:05:57.133 --> 01:05:59.897
He was more...

01:06:02.505 --> 01:06:04.302
powerful than me.

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.967
No. No one should be
treated like that.

01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:18.414
ls that right?

01:06:20.056 --> 01:06:21.887
ln whatworld do you live in?

01:06:23.192 --> 01:06:25.990
Carl,where is Julia Hickson?

01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:28.054
No names.

01:06:33.369 --> 01:06:34.734
Where is she?

01:06:36.272 --> 01:06:39.400
l know you, Carl.
You wantto tell me.

01:06:39.442 --> 01:06:41.910
Oh,you know me?

01:06:46.215 --> 01:06:49.116
Oh,you know who l am?

01:06:50.119 --> 01:06:51.984
Where is she?

01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:55.482
Where's Julia?

01:07:12.842 --> 01:07:15.072
That can't be right.

01:07:48.478 --> 01:07:49.843
Danger pulse.

01:07:50.847 --> 01:07:52.337
-No change.
-Christ.

01:07:52.382 --> 01:07:53.815
What about emergency cessation?

01:07:53.850 --> 01:07:56.546
Gradually terminate thefeed,
disable the receptors--

01:07:56.586 --> 01:07:57.814
lt could lead
to massive shock...

01:07:57.854 --> 01:07:59.913
and, Henry, could you please
shutthatthing off?

01:07:59.956 --> 01:08:01.150
What's going on?

01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:03.750
That hypothetical situation
l told you about?

01:08:03.793 --> 01:08:05.158
-lt's happening.
-Can'tyou stop it?

01:08:05.194 --> 01:08:06.422
lt's notthat simple.

01:08:06.462 --> 01:08:07.827
Well,you stopped it before--

01:08:07.864 --> 01:08:09.661
Yes,thatwas different.
Thatwas Edward.

01:08:09.699 --> 01:08:12.133
With Stargher, his mind
is unfamiliarterritory...

01:08:12.168 --> 01:08:14.295
and she's lost.
She thinks this is real.

01:08:14.337 --> 01:08:15.463
Well, is there anything
thatwe can do?

01:08:15.505 --> 01:08:18.997
Whateverwe do runs the risk
of making things worsefor her.

01:08:19.041 --> 01:08:21.305
Worse. That's great.

01:08:21.344 --> 01:08:22.868
So she's lost somewhere?

01:08:27.716 --> 01:08:30.481
-No. No.
-No,what?

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.782
l need you here.

01:08:52.475 --> 01:08:55.000
Fucking stop! Stop!

01:09:03.553 --> 01:09:04.986
Let me thefuck out!

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:11.721
Let me out!

01:09:11.761 --> 01:09:14.161
Get me out,you sickfuck!

01:09:14.197 --> 01:09:16.529
Fuckyou!

01:09:16.566 --> 01:09:18.727
Let me out.

01:09:22.537 --> 01:09:23.937
Do something.

01:09:23.973 --> 01:09:26.305
Do something to end this.

01:10:10.987 --> 01:10:13.922
l got bugs crawling
all over my body.

01:10:13.956 --> 01:10:15.446
lt gets worse.

01:10:18.294 --> 01:10:20.387
You're completely unprepared
forthis.

01:10:20.429 --> 01:10:22.897
Ah, Dr. Kent,
we've been over all this.

01:10:22.932 --> 01:10:25.059
Yes, but l've been
through the process.

01:10:25.101 --> 01:10:28.298
She wentthrough the process,
too, and it didn't matter.

01:10:28.337 --> 01:10:29.929
You don't know him.

01:10:39.115 --> 01:10:40.878
Be lucky.

01:10:42.184 --> 01:10:43.879
Come on, guys.

01:10:51.227 --> 01:10:52.387
Ready?

01:10:53.396 --> 01:10:56.559
Peter,thefirstfew minutes...

01:10:56.599 --> 01:10:58.328
will be very disorienting.

01:10:58.367 --> 01:11:02.235
Rememberto stay calm
andfocused.

01:11:02.271 --> 01:11:07.072
lnstincts play a very important
part here, so trustthem.

01:11:07.109 --> 01:11:08.235
All right.

01:11:08.277 --> 01:11:11.804
Peter,you've read herfile.

01:11:11.847 --> 01:11:13.872
Hit herwith something personal.

01:11:15.351 --> 01:11:16.875
And remember, Peter...

01:11:16.919 --> 01:11:19.046
it's not real.

01:13:27.516 --> 01:13:29.507
Have you seen him? My boy?

01:13:29.552 --> 01:13:31.611
My little one?
Hisfathertook himfrom me.

01:13:31.654 --> 01:13:34.452
l spit it out my hole.
Big deal. don't mean anything.

01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:37.357
My child's an abomination.
He has no soul.

01:14:50.633 --> 01:14:52.260
ls thatyou?

01:14:52.301 --> 01:14:53.825
You all right?

01:15:13.722 --> 01:15:15.451
Hold me.

01:15:20.129 --> 01:15:21.926
This isn't real.

01:15:21.964 --> 01:15:24.956
Did daddy do a bad thing?

01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:35.670
Don't be scared.

01:15:58.267 --> 01:15:59.427
This isn't real.

01:17:20.215 --> 01:17:22.649
Naughty worm.

01:17:45.607 --> 01:17:47.905
l'll kill you!

01:17:47.943 --> 01:17:49.570
Fuckyou, motherfucker!

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.194
Wouldn'tyou?

01:18:15.938 --> 01:18:17.769
When you were in college...

01:18:19.675 --> 01:18:22.473
Your baby brother
had a car accident!

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.878
He was in a comafor six months
before he died!

01:18:30.285 --> 01:18:32.913
And l'm sorryfor saying that!

01:18:35.724 --> 01:18:37.248

01:18:56.111 --> 01:18:57.738
This is not real!

01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:59.680

01:24:20.202 --> 01:24:21.931

01:24:33.081 --> 01:24:35.743

-She changed the codes.

01:25:34.676 --> 01:25:37.270
-She reversed thefeeds.
-What does that mean?

01:25:37.312 --> 01:25:40.611
The process is intended
for herto go into his mind.

01:25:40.649 --> 01:25:43.209
But instead,
she's bringing him into hers.

01:25:43.251 --> 01:25:45.947
Stop! No more!

01:27:18.613 --> 01:27:21.241

01:27:29.858 --> 01:27:31.382

01:27:31.426 --> 01:27:38.161
Oh...no, honey, l'm sorry.

01:27:38.199 --> 01:27:41.600
There's nothing
l can do aboutthat.

01:27:44.272 --> 01:27:45.739
Yes,there is.

01:27:52.948 --> 01:27:54.279
When l was a little boy...

01:27:56.952 --> 01:27:58.283

01:28:01.222 --> 01:28:04.521
He was injured and...

01:28:04.559 --> 01:28:07.050
had a broken leg or something.

01:28:10.699 --> 01:28:12.894
Well, myfather
found outthat l had it.

01:28:15.337 --> 01:28:17.897
And l knew that he would
do something horrible to it.

01:28:20.575 --> 01:28:22.202
ltwas just a matter of time.

01:28:23.712 --> 01:28:27.739
So l took itto the sink,
and l--l held it under.

01:28:32.454 --> 01:28:33.751
ltwas betterforthe bird.

01:28:36.925 --> 01:28:38.825
l saved him.

01:28:40.929 --> 01:28:43.090
l can't do that, Carl.

01:28:45.266 --> 01:28:47.131
l won't.

01:28:50.739 --> 01:28:52.536
lt doesn't matter.

01:29:00.949 --> 01:29:02.109
ltfound me.

01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:08.417

01:30:03.411 --> 01:30:05.402
Agent Novak? Go ahead.

01:30:05.447 --> 01:30:07.574
-Cole?
-Novak, listen to this.

01:30:07.615 --> 01:30:10.209
The hoistwas sold
to a guy named Bainbridge...

01:30:10.251 --> 01:30:12.446
who tried to build
a machine works out near Delano.

01:30:12.487 --> 01:30:14.751
Bainbridge

01:30:14.789 --> 01:30:16.416
and the state winds up
with the land.

01:30:16.458 --> 01:30:18.824
And guess who they hire
to seal the place up.

01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:20.293

Carl Rudolph Stargher.

01:30:24.332 --> 01:30:26.857
-Where's the land?
-Exit 10, off highway 99.

01:30:26.901 --> 01:30:29.131
