01:14.533 --> 01:15.398
<i>Earth...</i>

01:17.411 --> 01:18.492
<i>before the war...</i>

01:23.000 --> 01:24.332
<i>Life stretched out...</i>

01:24.960 --> 01:27.168
<i>to every corner of the planet.</i>

01:29.047 --> 01:33.007
<i>It became a world filled
with innovation and opportunity.</i>

01:35.596 --> 01:39.931
<i>Huge leaps in science saw humanity achieve
unimaginable results.</i>

01:42.352 --> 01:44.435
<i>Robotics became the way of the future.</i>

01:46.231 --> 01:49.645
<i>Artificial intelligence
became the new religion.</i>

01:51.278 --> 01:54.521
<i>We were the synthetic messiahs.</i>

01:59.828 --> 02:00.944
<i>But such power...</i>

02:01.788 --> 02:05.532
<i>in the proximity of primitives
only leads to one outcome:</i>

02:08.002 --> 02:08.993
<i>war.</i>

02:15.385 --> 02:16.671
<i>Bombs rained down...</i>

02:17.971 --> 02:20.054
<i>wave after wave after wave.</i>

02:22.059 --> 02:24.676
<i>The world entered a new Dark Age.</i>

02:26.688 --> 02:30.602
<i>From the ash, a great sickness was born:</i>

02:31.443 --> 02:32.524
<i>The Red Fever.</i>

02:37.658 --> 02:40.366
<i>Nations fell. Societies collapsed.</i>

02:44.373 --> 02:47.787
<i>Tribal warlords used us as weapons
against each other.</i>

02:49.795 --> 02:52.253
<i>I was one of the last synthetics
to survive.</i>

02:54.716 --> 02:55.957
<i>In the end, everyone lost.</i>

03:00.055 --> 03:01.045
<i>I wanted life.</i>

03:04.559 --> 03:05.970
<i>The humans wanted death.</i>

03:13.235 --> 03:14.601
<i>I cannot be part of that.</i>

03:17.406 --> 03:18.487
<i>I will not.</i>

03:22.369 --> 03:23.985
<i>Delete entry and purge all memories.</i>

03:24.079 --> 03:25.536
<i>Manual override confirmed.</i>

03:25.622 --> 03:26.908
<i>Initiate hibernation mode.</i>

04:40.322 --> 04:41.529
I'm gonna get you!

04:41.740 --> 04:42.571
No you won't!

04:42.657 --> 04:43.647
Move it up!

04:43.950 --> 04:45.282
Yeah, I got it, boss.

05:12.729 --> 05:13.970
Raiders!

05:14.856 --> 05:16.893
- Raiders!
- Let's go! Let's go!

05:17.275 --> 05:18.641
- Up top!
- Go, go!

05:18.735 --> 05:20.067
Where are the children?

05:20.403 --> 05:21.985
- Run, run, run!
- Go, go, go!

05:22.072 --> 05:23.483
Where are the kids?

05:24.032 --> 05:25.694
Get up! Up! Go on!

05:25.784 --> 05:26.865
Food and shelter!

05:27.410 --> 05:28.491
Raiders!

05:28.578 --> 05:29.489
Fly! Now!

05:29.579 --> 05:30.490
Come on!

05:30.747 --> 05:31.954
Up top!

05:32.040 --> 05:32.871
Raiders!

05:50.058 --> 05:52.050
Right now! Right now!
You've got to go!

05:52.143 --> 05:54.351
- Poppy, go! Poppy, please!
- Jack, you okay?

05:55.146 --> 05:56.227
- We're gonna be okay.
- Poppy!

05:56.314 --> 05:57.850
- Get up there as fast as you can!
- What?

05:57.941 --> 05:59.398
- Where do I go?
- Faster! Faster! Come on!

06:27.971 --> 06:30.384
Go back to whatever hellhole
you crawled out of!

06:30.974 --> 06:31.964
Gun?

06:32.058 --> 06:34.266
I ain't seen a gun working since the war!

06:36.897 --> 06:38.889
Go ahead and shoot, old man!

06:41.526 --> 06:42.812
No, Poppy!

06:42.903 --> 06:44.189
Poppy, no!

06:44.821 --> 06:46.528
Help me!

06:55.081 --> 06:56.071
Whoo!

07:09.095 --> 07:10.427
You're sure this is the place?

07:11.056 --> 07:12.046
Yeah, she's here.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.547
I know it.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.621
What was this place?

07:38.375 --> 07:39.832
Place used to be the future.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.286
Now it's just dust.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.006
Hey!

07:51.554 --> 07:52.544
Come here.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.271
This is the one we want.

08:10.824 --> 08:11.814
Where is she?

08:14.160 --> 08:15.150
Come on.

09:25.857 --> 09:26.847
Wake up.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.227
What do you see?

09:36.785 --> 09:37.775
Who are you?

09:39.120 --> 09:40.577
I'm the one who gave you life.

09:44.876 --> 09:45.866
Where am I?

09:49.547 --> 09:53.131
I've been looking for you for a long time.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.513
<i>No.</i>

10:20.578 --> 10:21.819
Come on! Wait up!

10:21.913 --> 10:24.280
Careful, Billy!
Not too close to the water, please!

10:24.833 --> 10:25.823
Hey, Rico!

10:27.752 --> 10:28.742
Rico.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.835
- How you feeling?
- Good.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.333
How's she?

10:37.053 --> 10:38.043
Better.

10:38.513 --> 10:39.754
She just asked about you.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.133
What you got there?

10:45.145 --> 10:46.602
Still believe in that magic, huh?

10:48.648 --> 10:49.638
It can save her.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.104
Paradise Beach ain't real.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.734
I don't know. I guess I just...

11:00.034 --> 11:01.275
have a feeling it's out there.

11:03.454 --> 11:04.444
Go see her.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.346
- Hey.
- Mm.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.394
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.060
Pour me some tea, will you?

11:36.404 --> 11:37.394
Yeah.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.441
I remember when you were just like
those little ones.

11:51.794 --> 11:52.910
You know there's medicine.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.587
Paradise Beach.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.424
I've heard stories about it.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.386
There's no medicine out there.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.555
There's just death and hate.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.512
I can't let you go, Mom.

12:08.603 --> 12:11.687
This oasis saved me
when I was young and broken.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.308
Take care of it after I'm gone.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.144
You're too young to die, Momma.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.235
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could decide that for ourselves?

12:24.327 --> 12:25.738
You'll be a great leader.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.533
I can see it in your eyes.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.291
Mom, I... I'm not really...

12:32.877 --> 12:35.870
If I could do it again,
I would speak more softly.

12:38.508 --> 12:39.919
I would listen longer...

12:41.344 --> 12:43.552
and I would hold you more closely.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.777
Whoo! Woo-hoo!

12:59.862 --> 13:00.852
Whoo!

13:08.204 --> 13:09.194
Yeah!

13:54.709 --> 13:55.699
Hey, old-timer.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.168
Hey.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.212
- How you doing?
- All right.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.130
- Yeah?
- Yup.

14:02.717 --> 14:03.707
Hey, uh...

14:04.385 --> 14:05.546
You ever see this place before?

14:06.554 --> 14:07.419
Yeah, I've been there.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.304
You don't want to go out there.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.630
It's not a good place.

14:11.893 --> 14:14.636
They call it the Temple of Life,
but it's not what it seems.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.015
Yeah, well, I'm going.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.688
I can't stop you.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.107
Do as you will.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.897
This is my new bride!

14:29.369 --> 14:30.530
Her name's Ash.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.823
Who wants to meet her first?

14:33.456 --> 14:35.539
Hold her down. I'll fuck her in the face!

14:38.252 --> 14:39.242
Fuck him.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.336
Oh, shit!

14:50.139 --> 14:51.471
Oh, yeah!

14:52.266 --> 14:53.507
Yeah, man!

14:53.601 --> 14:54.591
My man!

14:56.979 --> 14:58.220
Now show me death.

15:04.237 --> 15:10.825
Murder, murder, murder!

15:10.910 --> 15:12.151
Murder! Yeah!

15:17.125 --> 15:18.115
Yeah.

15:24.715 --> 15:25.705
Good girl.

15:49.699 --> 15:50.689
Mom.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.368
I'm gonna fix this.

15:57.582 --> 15:58.698
I'm gonna fix this.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.293
Hey!

16:11.679 --> 16:13.716
Hey, you know the queen will die
if you don't tell me.

16:14.599 --> 16:15.680
There's medicine there, right?

16:16.058 --> 16:17.515
Medicine that can save her life.

16:17.602 --> 16:18.433
Of course.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.226
Look, I don't care how dangerous it is,
all right?

16:20.313 --> 16:21.599
You need to tell me where it is.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.515
All right,
it's on the shore of the Dead Ocean.

16:24.609 --> 16:25.895
They can heal any pain there.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.815
- You can almost live forever.
- "Live forever"?

16:28.905 --> 16:30.362
Live forever but it's not a good place.

16:30.448 --> 16:31.689
It's not what you think it is.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.064
Tell me.

16:33.451 --> 16:34.282
All right.

16:34.368 --> 16:38.533
You take the North Star for three days
till you get to the Neon Forest.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.872
When you get to the Neon Forest,

16:41.501 --> 16:43.788
there are people there,
but you gotta be careful.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.332
They'll tell you how to get to the Temple.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.125
When you've reached the Dead Sea,

16:48.216 --> 16:49.502
you've reached the Temple.

16:53.971 --> 16:54.961
Go.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.011
Here.

17:03.773 --> 17:04.762
You're gonna need this.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.315
And take these, too.

17:12.656 --> 17:13.646
Good luck.

17:31.717 --> 17:32.958
Be home soon, Mom.

17:56.742 --> 17:57.903
I knew I'd find you here.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.655
Look, you're not gonna stop me, all right?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.486
That was never the plan.
You need help out there.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.196
Let's go!

18:13.175 --> 18:14.165
<i>Paradise Beach,</i>

18:16.596 --> 18:17.928
<i>a thousand mile ride...</i>

18:20.891 --> 18:22.473
<i>His companion, Rico,</i>

18:23.019 --> 18:24.430
<i>called it "The Road to Death."</i>

18:31.902 --> 18:33.484
<i>The prince spoke of the smell.</i>

18:36.282 --> 18:38.319
<i>A constant presence in this wasteland...</i>

18:41.537 --> 18:44.200
<i>is the smell of human flesh burning,</i>

18:46.125 --> 18:47.957
<i>fat melting.</i>

18:50.713 --> 18:52.454
<i>Fuel for the raiders.</i>

19:23.704 --> 19:25.036
Two guns, ten bullets.

19:25.956 --> 19:26.992
We're gonna need every one.

19:31.045 --> 19:33.037
The old traveler said
to follow the North Star.

19:35.091 --> 19:36.207
See where it takes us.

19:49.772 --> 19:50.888
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

19:50.981 --> 19:52.438
<i>It's your host with the most.</i>

19:52.858 --> 19:54.770
<i>Welcoming all y'all to Love Town,</i>

19:55.152 --> 19:56.984
<i>aka Titty City.</i>

19:57.071 --> 19:58.937
<i>And from city to city, titty to titty,</i>

19:59.031 --> 20:00.863
<i>we does it the best, baby!</i>

20:13.462 --> 20:14.669
<i>Welcome to Love Town,</i>

20:15.005 --> 20:16.667
<i>where everything goes down.</i>

20:25.474 --> 20:26.760
Are they robots like me?

20:27.059 --> 20:29.642
No, them bitches is real.

20:30.521 --> 20:33.104
They're gonna get old, get ugly,
and they're gonna die.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.771
Not like you,
you gonna stay perfect forever.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.990
Okay, that's the place
the old traveler was talking about.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.913
Let's just get information and get out.

21:00.676 --> 21:01.666
Keep your head down.

21:12.646 --> 21:13.807
What is this place?

21:13.898 --> 21:16.606
People who can't find love,
they buy love here.

21:37.755 --> 21:38.745
Be careful.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.289
Don't fall in love.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.002
Stay close.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.255
Hey!

21:49.975 --> 21:50.965
Yeah.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.348
You boys look a little lost.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.398
What can I get you?

21:59.485 --> 22:00.475
Some whiskey.

22:00.986 --> 22:01.897
Take a seat.

22:10.538 --> 22:11.904
For some info, if you got it.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.073
What are you looking for?

22:15.501 --> 22:16.992
Something called "Paradise Beach."

22:17.711 --> 22:18.952
Can you point us the right way?

22:21.090 --> 22:22.251
I ain't never heard of it.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.214
But I can ask Big Daddy.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.259
He knows the wasteland
like the back of his hand.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.257
I would be grateful.

22:33.644 --> 22:35.055
Give these guys a round on me.

22:35.896 --> 22:36.886
Have fun.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.651
- Think she's gonna help us?
- Not sure.

22:43.737 --> 22:44.898
Yo, Warlord.

22:45.155 --> 22:47.317
You enjoying that robotic coo-coo?

22:50.661 --> 22:53.153
Some guys down there are asking
about Paradise Beach.

22:53.247 --> 22:54.988
- You seen them before?
- Nope. Not in here.

22:56.750 --> 22:59.083
Them boys showed up on some shiny bikes.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.910
Damn sure ain't from around here.

23:01.338 --> 23:03.045
Yo, ain't you forgetting something?

23:04.216 --> 23:05.707
I'm sorry, Daddy, I was gonna tell you...

23:06.760 --> 23:08.376
You think you slick, don't you, bitch?

23:08.470 --> 23:10.883
I got eyes all around this motherfucker.
Now hand it over.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.137
Now kick rocks and go sell them drinks.

23:17.354 --> 23:18.936
Y'all ready to welcome in the new bitches?

23:19.023 --> 23:20.559
- Yes, sir.
- Well let's get it then.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.016
You a bad girl.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.861
You know, my family died of the fever.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.239
There was nothing I could do.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.954
Just because someone died
doesn't mean they're not with you.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.165
You boys enjoying your beers?

23:43.631 --> 23:45.213
You want a lap dance too, pretty boy?

23:45.299 --> 23:46.915
Nah, we're good, we're good, we're good.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.875
Our hoes ain't pretty enough for you?

23:49.303 --> 23:51.090
Maybe you'd rather have some dick to suck.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.671
Hey, we don't want any trouble!

23:52.765 --> 23:54.472
Usually we charge a no-cover charge,

23:54.558 --> 23:56.390
but you can just give us
the money straight up.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.511
- Hey, leave us alone, all right?
- Shut the fuck up!

23:59.605 --> 24:00.595
Put the knife away!

24:00.689 --> 24:03.227
I find something I want, I take it, okay?

24:03.484 --> 24:04.474
Okay?

24:05.152 --> 24:06.359
The fuck you gonna do about it?

24:11.283 --> 24:12.774
You ain't got no fucking bull...

24:15.079 --> 24:15.990
- Stay back!
- Hey!

24:16.080 --> 24:17.821
Stay back, or I got one for you, too!

24:18.082 --> 24:19.493
Where the fuck did they get ammo?

24:19.583 --> 24:20.994
No one got bullets no more.

24:26.048 --> 24:27.038
Let's get out of here.

24:29.635 --> 24:32.343
You boys sure do know how
to make an introduction.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.049
And I like that shit, man.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.471
But you can put the gun down.

24:35.557 --> 24:36.968
This is a place of peace!

24:37.643 --> 24:39.009
Back to business, everybody!

24:40.896 --> 24:44.480
Not only am I the proprietor
of this fine establishment,

24:45.192 --> 24:48.185
but I'm what you would call
a friendly panderer.

24:48.529 --> 24:49.645
So you're just a pimp?

24:49.738 --> 24:52.776
Ha! You say that like that's
a bad thing or something, man.

24:52.866 --> 24:53.697
Let's go.

24:53.784 --> 24:56.151
Pimp is the loneliest motherfucker
in this wasteland.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.994
I can't trust none of these bitches.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.916
Say, man, y'all trying to get
y'all dicks wet, or what?

25:03.711 --> 25:05.498
We're actually looking for Paradise Beach.

25:05.587 --> 25:06.828
We've heard there's medicine there.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.039
Hm, drug town, I know about it.

25:09.133 --> 25:10.089
Can you get us there?

25:10.426 --> 25:12.509
Look, man, that shit is
a dirty business, kid.

25:13.012 --> 25:16.096
If I help y'all, shoot,
it's like I'm perjuring myself.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.427
Well, what is it worth to you cowboys?

25:26.692 --> 25:28.149
So we basically partners now.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.901
And I know somebody
that can get you there.

25:31.405 --> 25:32.486
If you know what I'm saying.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.064
Hey, you're sure you want to do this?

25:35.159 --> 25:36.320
Let's see what he has to say.

25:36.410 --> 25:39.244
Calm your boy down, and let's roll.
Come on, man. Follow me.

25:50.799 --> 25:53.007
See, man, y'all should feel real special.

25:53.343 --> 25:55.050
See, I never bring nobody back here.

25:55.429 --> 25:57.796
I call this my Bitches Hall of Fame.

25:58.974 --> 25:59.964
You the man, right?

26:01.393 --> 26:02.804
Come in here, follow me.

26:02.895 --> 26:03.885
Got something special for...

26:04.688 --> 26:06.600
Wait a motherfucking minute.
Wait a motherfuck...

26:06.899 --> 26:09.141
Hey, bitches, get the fuck out of here!

26:10.194 --> 26:11.651
The fuck is wrong with y'all?

26:13.363 --> 26:14.570
Can't believe this shit.

26:15.491 --> 26:16.948
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, too.

26:17.034 --> 26:18.445
The kid needs to stay in my sight.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.652
Say, man, my girl is shy.

26:21.121 --> 26:22.657
If y'all wanna go to Paradise Beach,

26:22.998 --> 26:25.581
he's gonna have to talk to her
all by his self.

26:26.210 --> 26:27.121
Rico...

26:27.377 --> 26:28.367
It's cool.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.337
Hold on to this.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.586
Aw,
you gonna give the little guy a gun, huh?

26:34.927 --> 26:36.134
You got a blanket for him, too?

26:37.096 --> 26:38.883
Oh, you's a flashy cowboy, ain't you?

26:39.765 --> 26:41.097
Did I tell you I like that shit?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.300
Now you, little fella, check it out.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.017
I need you to have a real good time.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.686
Relax, 'cause you in good hands.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.722
Welcome to Paradise.

26:50.192 --> 26:51.683
Oh, yeah, one more thing.

26:53.237 --> 26:54.728
Don't be no stranger to danger.

26:55.489 --> 26:56.775
'Cause it's about to go down.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.035
How can I help you?

27:11.505 --> 27:13.292
I'm looking for Paradise Beach.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.547
Paradise Beach?

27:16.635 --> 27:17.625
Yeah.

27:18.428 --> 27:20.215
Yeah, my mom is very sick.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.296
She's in trouble.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.142
Yeah, and I don't have a lot of time.

27:28.897 --> 27:29.978
I want to help you.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.144
You're very kind.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.488
I can see it in your eyes.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.190
Who are you?

27:41.577 --> 27:42.567
I'm Ash.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.154
Your eyes...

27:47.499 --> 27:49.081
<i>Shut up and get on with it.</i>

27:49.168 --> 27:50.158
Yes.

27:53.547 --> 27:54.537
You're not human?

27:55.924 --> 27:57.085
I'm as human as you are.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.085
What do you see?

28:02.431 --> 28:03.421
I see you.

28:06.310 --> 28:07.300
Can you feel?

28:13.317 --> 28:14.307
I feel you.

29:10.999 --> 29:13.491
Oh, shit! Look at that little old bitch.

29:13.919 --> 29:14.909
Bring him to me!

29:15.254 --> 29:18.838
Shit... I think I want me a robot bitch.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.049
Bring him over here!

29:32.938 --> 29:34.804
- Oh, ho, ho, ho!
- Get the fuck off me!

29:36.692 --> 29:37.682
Get off!

29:37.985 --> 29:38.975
Fuck you!

29:39.569 --> 29:40.559
Come on.

29:41.238 --> 29:42.228
Rico!

29:42.823 --> 29:44.530
- Rico!
- String him up!

29:44.616 --> 29:45.606
Rico!

29:47.744 --> 29:49.030
Why did you kill Rico?

29:49.288 --> 29:50.369
Bring me the gun!

29:55.210 --> 29:56.701
Where'd you get these bullets?

29:58.046 --> 29:59.537
Where are you from, boy?

30:02.426 --> 30:03.416
Pull him up.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.253
- What are you doing?
- Pull him up!

30:14.396 --> 30:15.386
You gonna talk?

30:21.194 --> 30:22.184
Let him down!

30:26.408 --> 30:28.024
Where are you from, boy?

30:30.954 --> 30:31.944
Pull him up!

30:35.917 --> 30:37.749
You better sing, bird!

30:39.546 --> 30:40.707
You better sing!

30:43.258 --> 30:44.590
All right, let him down.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.335
There.

30:50.474 --> 30:51.464
The Oasis.

30:52.309 --> 30:53.299
The Oasis?

30:53.852 --> 30:55.684
- Yeah.
- You got more bullets there?

30:56.480 --> 30:57.311
Yes.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.021
You gonna take us there?

31:00.650 --> 31:01.640
Fuck you.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.191
Pull him up!

31:06.365 --> 31:08.573
You better start singing, little bird!

31:11.078 --> 31:12.694
You're running out of time!

31:18.251 --> 31:19.241
I'll talk.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.411
Let him down!

31:28.678 --> 31:30.010
You're a bad bitch.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.019
- Here you go.
- Ah!

31:46.488 --> 31:47.478
Get up. Get up!

31:58.458 --> 31:59.619
Let's go, baby.

32:02.421 --> 32:03.628
Let's go!

32:32.909 --> 32:34.901
<i>We ride south
to the prince's homeland.</i>

32:39.958 --> 32:42.951
<i>The warlord would rape
and murder everyone in the Oasis.</i>

32:45.714 --> 32:49.207
<i>It was at that moment I became aware
of exactly how different I was.</i>

32:52.387 --> 32:53.377
<i>But first...</i>

32:54.681 --> 32:56.217
<i>I had to set things right.</i>

32:59.352 --> 33:00.263
What are you doing?

33:17.746 --> 33:19.203
Yeah! Going somewhere?

33:37.557 --> 33:38.638
Come back!

33:40.602 --> 33:41.683
Come back!

33:47.400 --> 33:49.517
Come back, you fucking bitch!

33:50.737 --> 33:51.727
God damn it!

34:39.327 --> 34:40.362
Whoo!

34:41.204 --> 34:42.194
Come on, come on!

34:49.963 --> 34:50.793
Come on!

35:16.573 --> 35:19.486
Down there! Go get her! Go get her!

35:26.041 --> 35:27.031
Stop them!

35:37.218 --> 35:38.049
Over here!

35:52.692 --> 35:53.933
Where the fuck are they?

35:54.027 --> 35:55.017
Fuck!

35:59.366 --> 36:00.356
Come back!

36:02.994 --> 36:04.075
Come back!

36:06.956 --> 36:09.619
Come back, you fucking robotic bitch!

36:16.966 --> 36:18.377
Fucking come back!

37:35.879 --> 37:36.960
Why did you save me?

37:39.007 --> 37:39.997
I don't know.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.300
You're his robot, right?

37:46.222 --> 37:47.212
Yes.

37:48.308 --> 37:49.844
So then why aren't you listening to him?

37:52.395 --> 37:53.636
Maybe I'm malfunctioning.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.481
What is this place?

39:29.868 --> 39:30.949
I think it's a church.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.199
My mother told me about places like this.

39:35.665 --> 39:37.873
People would come here
when their souls need cleansing.

39:38.459 --> 39:39.449
"Souls"?

39:42.005 --> 39:43.086
What is souls?

39:44.799 --> 39:45.789
Soul?

39:47.176 --> 39:50.135
It's kind of hard to explain actually.
It's something inside you.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.300
It makes you who you are.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.216
All right.

39:56.853 --> 39:57.843
There you go.

40:06.487 --> 40:08.649
People used to come here
to try and talk to God.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.694
Cleanse themselves of their sins.

40:12.827 --> 40:13.817
What is "sins"?

40:15.288 --> 40:16.950
Sin? You'll s...

40:17.749 --> 40:19.411
Bad things that we do to each other.

40:21.044 --> 40:22.251
Like what I did to you.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.588
I don't want to do it anymore.

40:27.884 --> 40:28.874
I don't want to sin.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.763
Do you think I have a soul?

40:35.975 --> 40:36.965
Yeah.

40:37.602 --> 40:38.718
Yeah, I believe you do.

40:39.312 --> 40:40.268
But I'm not human.

40:48.029 --> 40:51.613
You know, one time, a traveler played
guitar for me in the Oasis.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.321
I had never heard anything like it before.

40:55.411 --> 40:56.242
It was...

40:58.247 --> 41:00.330
It was... It was amazing.

41:02.835 --> 41:05.043
It was like from another world.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.371
And I asked him,
"So how do you play this music?"

41:08.299 --> 41:12.088
And he told me his purpose on earth was
to reveal that the guitar had a soul.

41:12.553 --> 41:14.510
Can you teach me how to talk to God?

41:16.766 --> 41:17.756
Yeah.

41:22.647 --> 41:23.888
Let's get on our knees.

41:31.406 --> 41:32.396
And, uh...

41:34.325 --> 41:35.315
close your eyes.

41:40.581 --> 41:41.742
Your head just...

41:44.168 --> 41:45.409
He's going to help us.

41:52.301 --> 41:53.291
Ash?

41:55.096 --> 41:56.086
Ash!

41:58.850 --> 41:59.840
Ash, are you okay?

42:02.270 --> 42:03.260
Ash, get up!

42:06.691 --> 42:07.772
Ash.

42:08.985 --> 42:09.975
Ash!

42:28.546 --> 42:29.536
All right.

45:08.414 --> 45:09.404
It's real.

45:11.042 --> 45:12.032
It's real.

45:13.878 --> 45:14.868
Ash.

45:24.347 --> 45:25.337
Ash, it's real.

45:27.141 --> 45:28.131
We made it.

45:43.407 --> 45:45.239
Who are you? Get on your knees!

46:23.656 --> 46:24.487
Boo!

46:25.324 --> 46:26.155
Oh...

46:26.492 --> 46:27.482
Did I scare you?

46:28.536 --> 46:29.526
Who are you?

46:30.621 --> 46:31.486
Where's Ash?

46:31.580 --> 46:33.071
You wanna play a little game?
Yeah! Come on!

46:33.165 --> 46:34.531
Boys like to play games, don't they?

46:34.625 --> 46:36.833
- No, I don't. I wanna play...
- Shh.

46:36.919 --> 46:38.080
So here's the rules:

46:38.713 --> 46:39.829
you ask a question,

46:40.548 --> 46:41.629
and I ask a question.

46:42.508 --> 46:43.669
Sounds like fun, no?

46:44.510 --> 46:45.626
So...

46:46.387 --> 46:47.377
Who are you?

46:49.307 --> 46:50.297
I'm Prince.

46:51.475 --> 46:53.683
Wait a minute. Seriously? You're a prince?

46:54.603 --> 46:55.810
I mean, wow!

46:56.272 --> 46:57.763
I'm in the presence of royalty!

46:58.149 --> 46:59.890
- Who are you?
- Well, you know...

47:00.359 --> 47:03.318
This is <i>mi casa</i> and I'm the <i>jefe,</i>
that's who I am.

47:03.612 --> 47:05.399
This is the Temple of Life, isn't it?

47:06.699 --> 47:07.940
Oh, wow!

47:08.326 --> 47:09.783
Oh, man. Wow!

47:09.869 --> 47:11.201
Paradise Beach!

47:12.038 --> 47:13.404
God, it's so fucking pretty!

47:14.582 --> 47:17.916
But unfortunately for you, young man,
this isn't paradise.

47:18.794 --> 47:19.784
This...

47:20.338 --> 47:21.169
This...

47:22.131 --> 47:23.042
is Drug Town!

47:35.936 --> 47:37.052
Mm!

47:38.314 --> 47:39.304
Pretty one.

47:49.950 --> 47:52.237
Oh, what do we got here?

47:53.871 --> 47:55.282
Temple of Life, I have to say,

47:55.373 --> 47:56.534
that works, it really does,

47:56.624 --> 47:59.287
but you know,
this is better than life, man!

47:59.377 --> 48:00.743
I mean, there's no pain here.

48:01.212 --> 48:02.373
It's only bliss!

48:02.463 --> 48:05.001
I mean, where else are you gonna find that
in this fucked up world, right?

48:06.008 --> 48:09.046
So, you're doing the whole tourist thing
of the wasteland or...

48:09.720 --> 48:11.006
is there something else you're after?

48:13.057 --> 48:14.389
Well, I heard you have cures.

48:14.475 --> 48:16.341
Oh, yeah! We have loads of cures.

48:17.311 --> 48:18.301
A lot.

48:19.230 --> 48:21.142
My mom, she's very sick.

48:21.524 --> 48:23.106
- Aw.
- She has the Red Fever.

48:23.317 --> 48:24.683
That's a terrible, terrible sickness.

48:24.777 --> 48:25.858
Wow, I feel for you.

48:27.571 --> 48:29.437
But that particular cure, you know,

48:29.532 --> 48:31.444
it's just a little hard
to come by these days.

48:32.243 --> 48:33.233
So you don't have it.

48:35.079 --> 48:36.195
We do. Come on!

48:39.375 --> 48:40.786
This is it, all right?

48:40.876 --> 48:43.994
This is where you're gonna get
your medicine, Prince.

48:44.213 --> 48:45.203
In here?

48:45.840 --> 48:47.376
Well, look, I know it's a little...

48:48.509 --> 48:49.670
not much to look at, okay?

48:49.760 --> 48:51.797
But we have everything you need.

48:53.389 --> 48:54.379
First.

48:57.560 --> 48:59.722
You have to become one of us!

48:59.812 --> 49:00.643
What?

49:01.272 --> 49:02.262
Hey.

49:02.565 --> 49:04.101
You want the medicine for your mother?

49:04.191 --> 49:05.727
This is how you're gonna get it.

49:05.818 --> 49:07.309
- Why?
- Soon...

49:07.403 --> 49:08.939
- Wait, wait! Wait, wait!
- ...your troubles

49:09.029 --> 49:10.270
will be a thing of the past!

49:10.364 --> 49:12.230
Okay, just hold on one second because...

49:12.491 --> 49:13.322
Are you in?

49:14.326 --> 49:15.316
Welcome to my world.

49:26.797 --> 49:28.789
Feel that medicine flow through you.

49:29.925 --> 49:31.962
Let it take over you, yeah.

49:32.845 --> 49:34.586
Yeah, right? It's so nice.

49:36.765 --> 49:37.926
It's so great, right?

50:01.165 --> 50:03.122
Find out what's up with you.

50:06.462 --> 50:07.452
Uhh!

50:08.589 --> 50:10.672
You are bleeding like a monkey.

50:10.758 --> 50:12.420
Mm! Yeah.

50:12.927 --> 50:14.668
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

50:18.849 --> 50:19.885
Ahh!

50:20.935 --> 50:21.925
All right.

50:25.064 --> 50:26.054
Ahh!

50:27.149 --> 50:28.105
Oh, yeah.

50:34.448 --> 50:35.438
Ahh!

50:36.992 --> 50:38.233
You feel that, huh?

50:38.953 --> 50:39.943
Yeah?

50:40.454 --> 50:41.319
Yeah, you do.

50:41.413 --> 50:42.949
I'm just gonna look at it right here.

50:52.883 --> 50:53.964
Come on, baby.

50:54.426 --> 50:55.257
Yeah.

50:55.344 --> 50:56.334
Feel the pleasure.

50:57.263 --> 50:59.095
Yeah, it magnifies everything,

50:59.181 --> 51:01.093
that stuff burning
through your bloodstream,

51:01.183 --> 51:03.049
and everything is magnified!

51:04.270 --> 51:07.308
Joy, love, lust.

51:08.315 --> 51:09.305
Jealousy!

51:10.276 --> 51:11.562
Fucking hate!

51:14.446 --> 51:15.903
Hate of the wasteland!

51:33.966 --> 51:35.377
Now the moment of truth.

51:37.511 --> 51:38.501
Hello?

51:39.138 --> 51:40.219
You register?

51:41.640 --> 51:42.630
Where am I?

51:43.225 --> 51:45.683
Don't worry. You're in a safe space.

51:51.734 --> 51:52.895
Yeah, um...

51:52.985 --> 51:55.602
Sorry about that,
that stuff's hard to come by,

51:55.696 --> 51:57.062
and you were bleeding like a pig.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.230
You saved me.

52:03.203 --> 52:04.785
Well, yeah, yeah, sort of.

52:07.833 --> 52:08.823
Thank you.

52:15.591 --> 52:16.581
Are you a prisoner?

52:21.138 --> 52:22.504
I wouldn't call myself that.

52:22.598 --> 52:24.760
So you can leave whenever you want?

52:26.435 --> 52:27.846
You wouldn't understand.

52:29.563 --> 52:31.725
But if I had a choice,
I'd stay where I'm at.

52:34.735 --> 52:36.727
The wasteland's full of awful people.

52:38.072 --> 52:39.233
I do understand.

52:47.915 --> 52:49.076
That's how I got this.

53:00.469 --> 53:01.550
What do you think?

53:06.725 --> 53:08.136
This is all I've ever wanted.

53:09.978 --> 53:10.968
This...

53:11.647 --> 53:13.354
more than anything in Oasis.

53:14.650 --> 53:16.642
Oasis? What's that, sweetie?

53:18.362 --> 53:19.352
Oasis?

53:23.033 --> 53:24.023
It's alive.

53:29.873 --> 53:31.535
My mother didn't want me to leave.

53:33.919 --> 53:35.251
She thought it was perfect.

53:38.841 --> 53:41.959
It's not a complete and total mess
like the rest of the world.

53:43.387 --> 53:44.377
It's blissful.

53:44.680 --> 53:46.797
Yeah, it sounds pretty damn near perfect.

53:47.182 --> 53:48.172
You see that?

53:49.101 --> 53:50.182
Water here is dead.

53:51.103 --> 53:55.143
We got nothing, we got nothing,
nothing, nothing inside of us.

53:56.358 --> 53:57.974
You know, I'd love to see a tree,

53:58.360 --> 53:59.851
see a flower in my lifetime.

53:59.945 --> 54:02.062
I mean, it's sad, isn't it?
Isn't it so fucking sad?

54:02.156 --> 54:03.738
Why do you have to make me so fucking sad?

54:04.825 --> 54:05.815
Here.

54:07.619 --> 54:08.609
Try this.

54:11.832 --> 54:12.663
Just go...

54:15.502 --> 54:17.539
Go ahh...

54:21.508 --> 54:23.966
So your traveling companion, Ash?

54:24.970 --> 54:26.427
She's the perfect woman, right?

54:26.513 --> 54:27.720
Incorruptible by time.

54:27.806 --> 54:30.344
Not of flesh and bones
but of something pure.

54:31.185 --> 54:32.596
Yeah, God, I love that.

54:33.854 --> 54:35.516
Purity, purity, it's just...

54:36.940 --> 54:38.056
It's what I've been after.

54:48.786 --> 54:49.947
Sweet dreams.

55:19.566 --> 55:20.556
<i>My son...</i>

55:21.318 --> 55:22.183
<i>My prince...</i>

55:24.655 --> 55:25.645
<i>Come home.</i>

56:05.112 --> 56:06.148
Oh, shit!

56:07.239 --> 56:08.355
Get up! Get up!

56:58.332 --> 57:00.369
You're just a sweet little baby,
aren't you?

57:02.711 --> 57:05.044
My sweet, little baby.

57:06.965 --> 57:07.955
What?

57:08.050 --> 57:09.586
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

57:10.469 --> 57:12.552
Don't be sad. Don't be sad.

57:13.305 --> 57:14.762
Because I'm gonna cherish you...

57:16.266 --> 57:17.973
and I'm gonna bring out the best in you.

57:19.061 --> 57:19.972
And then... And...

57:20.062 --> 57:22.099
And you're gonna bring out
the best in me, too.

57:22.189 --> 57:23.100
Right?

57:29.613 --> 57:30.694
Oh, thank you.

57:32.199 --> 57:33.315
Oh, thank you.

59:15.844 --> 59:17.176
Game's simple, Prince.

59:17.804 --> 59:18.794
What you want...

59:21.516 --> 59:23.178
is in that sasquatch's belly.

59:24.686 --> 59:26.143
Now we're gonna make a deal.

59:26.730 --> 59:29.393
It's gonna be fun,
kind of like a fight to the death.

59:30.233 --> 59:31.064
All right?

59:31.151 --> 59:33.768
You win, you get the cure.
You lose, you die.

59:34.529 --> 59:35.519
Fun!

59:42.829 --> 59:44.070
Here's the wild card.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:44.672
Now for the wild card.

01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:42.313
Can't believe it.

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:44.569
Didn't know you had it in you.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.947
What you want is in that man's stomach.

01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:40.625
You earned that, boy.

01:02:54.688 --> 01:02:55.678
Ash.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:57.389
Let's get out of here.

01:02:58.275 --> 01:02:59.265
Whoa.

01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:02.059
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.482
You asked for a cure...

01:03:06.574 --> 01:03:07.405
Not a robot.

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:09.817
No.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.033
- I'm not going anywhere without her.
- I gave you your medicine.

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:15.284
I saved your friend's life.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.708
She stays... with me.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:20.207
No, fuck you, fuck this.

01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:21.669
We're leaving.

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:24.123
Look, you can leave now,
or we could end it right here.

01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:25.048
Hm?

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:29.421
I'm not leaving without her.

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:31.839
Leave.

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:33.757
Time's running out.

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:39.471
Ash...

01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:41.598
Go.

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:56.322
Breaking my heart.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:52.488
Told you I choose what I do.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:53.939
I'm gonna get you out.

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:08.787
Shit! What if they come?

01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:10.089
- It's okay.
- Shit.

01:06:10.175 --> 01:06:11.211
Lei, it's okay.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:15.131
How can you be so calm
when everything's gone to shit?

01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:20.007
Stop.

01:06:25.106 --> 01:06:26.096
It is what it is.

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:29.562
It is what it is?

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.271
I wish I could be like you.

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:36.322
I wish I could just...

01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:38.825
not feel my feelings and worries so much.

01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:54.500
You should cherish your feelings
whether they're good or bad.

01:06:59.224 --> 01:07:00.214
Can you feel this?

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:10.432
And this?

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:17.773
Yes.

01:07:21.788 --> 01:07:23.029
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be doing this.

01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:24.613
I shouldn't take advantage of you.

01:07:30.672 --> 01:07:31.662
Lei...

01:07:35.343 --> 01:07:36.424
I like this feeling.

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:26.470
<i>It was at this moment...</i>

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:30.604
<i>I made a connection.</i>

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:33.932
<i>I feel something.</i>

01:08:35.903 --> 01:08:37.144
<i>Something pure.</i>

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:42.278
I've never had this feeling before.

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:46.448
It's so different than all the others.

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:49.661
Sorry.

01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:50.741
Don't be.

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:54.286
I wanted to.

01:08:57.258 --> 01:08:58.669
Could feel your heartbeat.

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:01.001
Your energy.

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:05.805
And I don't even know
what that is anymore.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.938
I was taken from my family
when I was a young girl.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:15.649
A group of raiders took me.

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:18.689
I was so little.

01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:23.608
And I learned how really awful
people can be.

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:31.743
Then I got older.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:35.377
They no longer had use for me so...

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:38.796
they just sold me away.

01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:41.170
That's how I ended up here.

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.423
I'm really glad you fixed me, though.

01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:50.216
Me too.

01:09:54.232 --> 01:09:57.475
She was supposed to be the perfect woman.

01:10:00.488 --> 01:10:01.649
She's pure, right?

01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:03.563
Wow.

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:06.025
So fucking pure.

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:10.404
I gave you...

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:11.534
I gave you everything, though.

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:14.207
I raised you,
I gave you respect.

01:10:15.294 --> 01:10:16.284
You don't understand.

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:20.880
You took away the one thing
that was supposed to be mine.

01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:23.834
Fucking corrupted her!

01:10:26.514 --> 01:10:27.595
You're a...

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:30.842
You're... You're a virus.

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:33.468
You're a...

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.814
disgusting, sneaky, little virus.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:38.731
Don't say that!

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:43.404
Shut your fucking mouth.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.157
You know what? Everything's gonna be okay.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:50.531
No, no, no, yeah. We're gonna fix this.

01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:52.946
So, um...

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:54.994
What we're gonna do is...

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:57.037
You're gonna wipe her hard drive.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:10:58.915
You're gonna wipe it clean.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:00.370
Boom. Done.

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:02.502
Fresh fucking start, right? Yeah.

01:11:03.301 --> 01:11:06.385
When she wakes up,
she's not gonna remember you...

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:14.222
or any of this shit.

01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:17.604
When she wakes up...

01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:20.644
she's gonna see me.

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:31.777
She's gonna...

01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:34.821
She's gonna love me.

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:30.718
They're right there! Get them!

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:34.423
Hurry up! This way!
Hurry the fuck up! They're right there!

01:12:35.977 --> 01:12:36.967
Get them!

01:12:58.082 --> 01:12:59.072
What the fuck?

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:39.905
No, please!

01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:04.513
My fucking palace. I'm the fucking <i>jefe.</i>

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:08.937
Get the fuck out!

01:14:25.086 --> 01:14:26.076
Yeah!

01:14:26.337 --> 01:14:27.418
Fuck you!

01:14:35.513 --> 01:14:37.596
No fucking pain, motherfucker!

01:15:23.394 --> 01:15:25.386
You like that? You like that?

01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:36.488
Fucking bitch.

01:15:49.795 --> 01:15:50.785
Hi.

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:52.537
Stop.

01:15:54.425 --> 01:15:55.415
Take them.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.138
They tried to take my bride.

01:16:06.687 --> 01:16:07.723
She's mine!

01:16:10.608 --> 01:16:12.440
They tried to make friends with her.

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:15.105
Take her away from me!

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:17.562
She's mine!

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:20.694
Put them down there.

01:16:20.951 --> 01:16:22.408
- Come on.
- Ash... Ash!

01:16:30.002 --> 01:16:31.083
Cut off their heads.

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:36.919
That's not you, Ash.

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:50.221
Don't listen to him, Ash.

01:16:51.732 --> 01:16:52.722
It's not you.

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:54.857
It's not you.

01:16:55.694 --> 01:16:56.810
It's not you.

01:16:58.572 --> 01:16:59.562
Kill them.

01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:01.531
- Kill them now.
- No.

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:12.333
Stop, you demonic bitch!

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:33.184
Kill them!

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:46.777
No!

01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:28.151
- Stop!
- What?

01:18:28.245 --> 01:18:29.281
- Stop the bike!
- Why?

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:30.327
- Stop!
- Why?

01:18:30.414 --> 01:18:31.950
- Ash, what are you doing?
- Stop! Get off!

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:38.502
What are you doing?

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:40.584
Ash!

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:06.749
<i>Warlord is dead.</i>

01:20:10.264 --> 01:20:11.721
<i>But another will replace him.</i>

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:20.472
<i>This world has no memory.</i>

01:20:42.296 --> 01:20:43.707
Everyone, the prince is back!

01:20:44.965 --> 01:20:46.206
I have to go do something.

01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:48.541
What?

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:50.084
Where are you going?

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:56.008
You gave me a soul.

01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:38.800
Mom.

01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:41.344
Mom!

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.726
I have the medicine.

01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:24.720
My son...

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:49.625
<i>We continue onwards...</i>

01:22:52.259 --> 01:22:53.841
<i>searching for others like me.</i>

01:22:55.762 --> 01:22:58.800
<i>We have to find them
and show them what we learned.</i>

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:03.760
<i>That beyond all intellect and knowledge
exists something greater,</i>

01:23:05.856 --> 01:23:08.143
<i>something more powerful than any person,</i>

01:23:10.027 --> 01:23:11.017
<i>any weapon.</i>

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:15.730
<i>Hope.</i>

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:13.796
Man, what's taking
so goddamn long with my food?

01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:16.841
Can a pimp get something to eat
around this motherfucker?

01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:19.218
Shit, if I have to wait any longer,

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:21.637
I swear I'mma put my foot
in one of you bitches' ass.

01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:23.798
Fuck!

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:26.934
Ahh! Fucking bitch!

01:24:29.481 --> 01:24:30.562
You're all free now!

01:24:30.649 --> 01:24:32.106
What the fuck are you doing?

01:24:36.363 --> 01:24:38.070
Fuck! Rosie!

01:24:39.533 --> 01:24:40.364
Rosie!

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:45.028
Fuck! Help! Somebody fucking help!

01:24:45.455 --> 01:24:46.445
Fuck!
