<i>one of the most iconic</i>
<i>tourist destinations in the Big Apple.</i>

00:21.104 --> 00:24.566
Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs.
Hey! You want a hot dog?

00:24.774 --> 00:26.651
NARRATOR: <i>Slow day in the world</i>
<i>of hot dog vending?</i>

00:26.818 --> 00:28.695
Hey, you. Yeah, it sure is.

00:29.154 --> 00:32.323
Gotta say it's fine by me,
I've been working my buns off lately.

00:32.574 --> 00:35.160
As a matter of fact, you mind watching
my cart while I take me a little nap?

00:35.243 --> 00:36.786
-NARRATOR: <i>Oh no. I...</i>
-Thanks.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.497
-NARRATOR: <i>Oh, fine. I'll play along.</i>
-(SNORES)

00:39.706 --> 00:44.753
(ENCHANTING MUSIC PLAYING)

00:44.919 --> 00:47.088
This is what I'm talking about.

00:47.589 --> 00:51.176
Hot dog vendor by day
and powerful sorceress by...

00:51.968 --> 00:53.303
also day.

00:53.928 --> 00:56.389
Dr. Strange, eat your heart out.

00:56.973 --> 00:59.184
NARRATOR: <i>It looks like you're gonna</i>
<i>have to put your newfound powers</i>

00:59.267 --> 01:01.186
<i>to the test. The city is under attack!</i>

01:01.394 --> 01:02.854
Powers? But it's my first day.

01:02.937 --> 01:05.482
I haven't even started
my Mystic Arts training yet.

01:05.857 --> 01:06.900
NARRATOR: <i>We have to do something.</i>

01:06.983 --> 01:09.194
<i>There's an alien horde</i>
<i>about to overtake the city.</i>

01:09.486 --> 01:11.446
We need to get the Avengers here. Now!

01:11.529 --> 01:12.781
I don't have a Sling Ring yet,

01:12.864 --> 01:14.741
so you're going to have to open up
the portal for us.

01:14.824 --> 01:15.867
NARRATOR: <i>The portals I can do,</i>

01:15.950 --> 01:17.243
<i>but actually bringing</i>
<i>the Avengers through them?</i>

01:17.327 --> 01:20.080
<i>I don't know. Luckily, I may have just</i>
<i>the friends who can get them here.</i>

01:20.163 --> 01:22.290
Okay, so get them here, now.

01:22.457 --> 01:23.500
(LOUD EXPLOSION)

01:23.583 --> 01:27.545
And I'll just be here,
protecting this very sacred bench.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.215
NARRATOR: <i>Stay safe, Sorceress.</i>
<i>Help is on the way.</i>

01:32.634 --> 01:36.304
<i>Introducing three exceptional teams</i>
<i>of the world's best food artists.</i>

01:37.680 --> 01:39.224
<i>Anything Is Possible,</i>

01:39.307 --> 01:42.310
<i>an international dream team,</i>
<i>eager to live up to their name.</i>

01:44.020 --> 01:47.774
<i>Masterful produce carvers and bakers,</i>
<i>2 Foxes And A Relic.</i>

01:49.943 --> 01:53.780
<i>And The Misfits, a dynamic team</i>
<i>of competitive food artists.</i>

01:55.156 --> 01:58.827
<i>Which of these three teams will summon</i>
<i>the best Avengers to save the city</i>

01:59.077 --> 02:02.122
<i>and take home</i>
<i>the coveted Disney Foodtastic pin,</i>

02:02.288 --> 02:05.083
<i>a priceless badge of honor,</i>
<i>more precious than the Tesseract?</i>

02:16.719 --> 02:19.722
There was an idea called,
"The Avengers Initiative."

02:20.265 --> 02:23.393
The idea was to bring together
a group of remarkable people.

02:23.685 --> 02:27.355
See if they could become something more,
see if they could work together

02:27.480 --> 02:30.358
when we needed them
to fight the battles that we never could.

02:31.192 --> 02:34.195
Kind of sounds like,
I'm talking about you all, huh?

02:36.906 --> 02:39.951
This is <i>Foodtastic.</i>

02:40.160 --> 02:43.538
(ALL CHEER)

02:44.914 --> 02:47.250
Your task will require tons of teamwork.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.460
But I'm afraid that just won't be enough.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.256
Not to worry, help is on the way.

02:53.631 --> 02:55.466
We have our very own Nick Fury

02:55.592 --> 02:57.719
and Agent Maria Hill
of the food art world,

02:57.969 --> 03:00.555
Amirah Kassem and Benny Rivera.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.683
-(ALL CHEER)
-(MYSTICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

03:09.606 --> 03:11.232
All right, let's get into it.

03:12.317 --> 03:16.112
It was a monumental task bringing
the Avengers together in one team.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.324
It will be no less daunting
to help our sorceress fight off

03:19.407 --> 03:20.658
this new invasion.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.452
Your task today...

03:23.244 --> 03:28.750
open a portal like Dr. Strange,
and summon two Avengers to save the day.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.252
We'll be looking for technical ability.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.172
The right superhero posture in your build

03:34.339 --> 03:37.050
is harder to achieve
than some people might think.

03:37.383 --> 03:42.263
Giving your character that special
heroic stance will be very impressive.

03:42.597 --> 03:43.890
AMIRAH: There's also storytelling.

03:44.265 --> 03:48.728
This shouldn't just be heroes coming
through a portal, it should tell a story.

03:49.938 --> 03:54.525
Now, this is an invasion,
so time is something we don't have.

03:54.776 --> 03:58.238
In fact if you don't finish
your foodscapes before sundown...

03:59.739 --> 04:01.324
then it's lights out for all of us.

04:02.784 --> 04:06.829
And any food you do not use in your builds
will be donated to charity.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.541
You have until the sun sets, artists.
We're counting on you.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.043
What are you waiting for, people?

04:12.168 --> 04:13.962
The Avengers aren't going
to bring themselves here.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.213
Go play with your food.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.340
GUIDO: I think I got this.

04:17.548 --> 04:20.134
-Okay.
-GUIDO: Okay, so the Sorceress needs

04:20.301 --> 04:21.636
the help of some Avengers.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.055
Let's build Captain America
and Iron Man,

04:24.138 --> 04:28.017
because I'm personally in love
with Tony Stark. (CHUCKLES)

04:28.184 --> 04:29.769
I want to do Groot.

04:30.061 --> 04:34.857
Okay. What do you say we do Nebula?
'Cause she's like the good and the bad.

04:35.024 --> 04:36.526
You know, kind of goes back and forth.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.528
BLAQUE: The Sorceress would want
Black Panther and Rocket

04:38.611 --> 04:39.654
to come through the portal.

04:39.737 --> 04:41.239
-JESSE: Yeah.
-Which is your favorite?

04:41.656 --> 04:44.200
Captain America because he look good.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.827
(ALL LAUGH)

04:46.035 --> 04:47.370
He have the muscle.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.331
We are basically the United Nations
of the food world.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.041
On is from Thailand.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.252
Ale is from Colombia.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.213
I'm from a little bit of everywhere,
mostly United States, but...

04:57.880 --> 05:00.008
Basically, we have
three different languages

05:00.174 --> 05:03.469
but we share the same language,
which is art.

05:03.678 --> 05:04.929
GUIDO: <i>The characters gotta be perfect,</i>

05:05.013 --> 05:07.307
<i>but we also have to get this garden</i>
<i>just beautiful</i>

05:07.432 --> 05:10.393
<i>because that showcases</i>
<i>another skill set of all of us.</i>

05:10.518 --> 05:12.353
But don't forget about me,
'cause I need your help

05:12.437 --> 05:13.813
-with the characters.
-Yeah.

05:13.896 --> 05:14.939
-We will help you.
-They're big.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.359
It's a huge challenge
because they are the two hardest ones.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.902
Which means we didn't take
the easy way out.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.196
Anything is possible for team, yeah?

05:22.488 --> 05:24.907
Although, it looks very impossible.
(LAUGHS)

05:26.159 --> 05:30.997
RACHELL: So for Groot, we can have,
maybe his head out of watermelon?

05:31.164 --> 05:32.832
-Yeah? Okay.
-RAY: All right. I think we can do that.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.669
<i>I'll take care of whatever</i>
<i>landscape we need,</i>

05:36.753 --> 05:41.132
<i>like flowers, hummingbirds,</i>
<i>bumblebees, fruit flies.</i>

05:41.257 --> 05:44.302
I'm gonna be hip-deep
in potatoes and greenery.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.263
You girls are gonna be hip-deep
in rice cereal treats

05:47.430 --> 05:49.432
-and marshmallows and chocolate.
-Let's just hope we make you proud.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.851
Well, I'm sure you will, ladies.
I'm sure you will.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.228
-Hello, hello, hello!
-Hello!

05:54.354 --> 05:57.106
-Hi, guys.
-So, it's 2 Foxes And A Relic.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.399
-RACHELL: Yes.
-Yes.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.651
And how did the two foxes get up
with the relic?

06:00.860 --> 06:02.987
Rachell was a student of mine.

06:03.154 --> 06:06.532
And so, when this opportunity came up,
I said, "You have to go."

06:06.699 --> 06:10.036
-Oh, my God.
-And then through a mutual friend,

06:10.119 --> 06:11.579
-Sherry joined our team.
-RACHELL: Yeah.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.498
And it's been downhill ever since.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.625
-No! It's actually been really good.
-(ALL LAUGH)

06:15.917 --> 06:18.086
So she is the cake and chocolate
and sugar artist,

06:18.211 --> 06:20.630
and Rachell is the cookie whiz,

06:20.755 --> 06:23.633
and I'm a produce artist,
which means anything

06:23.758 --> 06:26.260
that's in the garden is fair game,
so I make...

06:27.053 --> 06:28.304
Well, you'll see.

06:28.429 --> 06:29.514
-Oh!
-Oh!

06:29.597 --> 06:31.599
That's an excellent skill
to bring to <i>Foodtastic.</i>

06:31.682 --> 06:33.810
-Yeah.
-And I'm very excited to hear

06:33.893 --> 06:35.186
how it's gonna be displayed

06:35.353 --> 06:37.980
-in your design!
-Well, the two Avengers

06:38.064 --> 06:42.819
that we want to help save the city
are Groot and Nebula.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.028
KEKE: Mm-hmm.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.280
Groot will be covered
with rice cereal treat,

06:46.406 --> 06:49.617
along with fondant and gingerbread.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.911
And then Nebula,

06:51.994 --> 06:54.956
I'm going to be making her legs
out of rice cereal,

06:55.123 --> 06:56.332
her body out of cake.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.876
And Nebula is kind of on the edge.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.461
-She's good, she's bad.
-Yeah. Yep.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.713
She doesn't know
whether to stick it to you or not.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.007
-That's Nebula.
-So, we're gonna have them

07:05.258 --> 07:08.219
come through the portal
to kind of a serene garden setting,

07:08.719 --> 07:12.098
so that Groot can kind
of persuade Nebula to like,

07:12.223 --> 07:14.350
-come on over to the good side.
-BENNY: That's awesome!

07:14.434 --> 07:15.518
Ray! I love Ray.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.854
I just met you, and in five minutes, Ray,
and I already love you.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.440
I feel like we're not getting anything,
Benny.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.066
Mind your business.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.193
-Mind your business.
-You realize we are the judges.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.570
Yes. Just so you guys do know.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.071
-We're judging.
-All right. All right.

07:27.321 --> 07:29.365
I gotta get these guys out of here
before they get jealous.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.533
I got you covered.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.201
-See you guys.
-See you guys.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.163
JESSE: All right, so we're gonna have
it look like the street.

07:35.371 --> 07:37.248
Let's make it look like the street,
like black or grayish asphalt

07:37.331 --> 07:39.292
-with those, bright yellow lime.
-We can use, like, black-eyed peas.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.960
-Yeah.
-Hello, hello!

07:41.043 --> 07:42.628
-Hello, Misfits.
-Hey, guys.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.338
-Hello, how you doing?
-So...

07:44.464 --> 07:46.841
-I'm doing good. How you doing?
-I'm doing good, too.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.051
Well, let's get into this design
you guys are gonna be making

07:49.135 --> 07:50.636
and how you gonna
be helping our sorceress.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.807
Yes. So we have Rocket the Raccoon,
and then you got Black Panther.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.809
-KEKE: All right.
-You know, or Blaque Panther.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.604
-Okay!
-He is the Blaque Panther.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.814
-I'm just...
-He's exactly to scale.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.649
I'm just saying. I'm to scale.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.151
-I mean, I got my mask...
-KEKE: I love that.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.528
-...sitting over there in the corner.
-KEKE: Where they landing?

08:07.695 --> 08:09.489
BLAQUE: <i>So, they're gonna be landing</i>
<i>right in the middle</i>

08:09.614 --> 08:12.366
<i>-of the city, directly on the streets.</i>
-KEKE: <i>Okay.</i>

08:12.533 --> 08:14.952
STACY: Our piece is socially charged.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.288
So you know, maybe they're coming out
and they're gonna help

08:17.413 --> 08:19.165
bring some unity to the situation.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.542
-Yeah.
-Okay. I can't wait to see it, you guys!

08:21.667 --> 08:23.211
-I can't wait. We're so excited.
-I'm so excited.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.629
-Thank you, guys.
-See you guys later.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.425
-STACY: Okay, let's do it.
-JESSE: Okay.

08:36.432 --> 08:37.475
-RACHELL: Ready?
-SHERRY: Yeah.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.101
RAY: Let's go get some stuff.

08:40.144 --> 08:41.646
-Oh, man!
-SHERRY: Oh, my goodness!

08:41.729 --> 08:43.564
RACHELL: Look at this stuff.

08:43.689 --> 08:45.816
-JESSE: Get some of those colors.
-STACY: Let's get this.

08:48.569 --> 08:50.071
Oh, dude, look at those.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.198
-Grab some of those.
-Okay.

08:53.407 --> 08:54.659
ON: I'm putting it in my hand.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.494
GUIDO: (GROANS) You need pockets.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.246
All right.

08:59.497 --> 09:00.498
Escapees.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.708
(LAUGHS)

09:06.629 --> 09:08.589
BLAQUE:
It's time to do some experimenting.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.049
(LAUGHS)

09:10.466 --> 09:11.634
We'll start making some flowers.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.094
-Okay.
-So, whatever you want to use,

09:13.177 --> 09:14.720
I'd definitely get a bunch of these done.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.722
These, we can probably quarter.

09:17.014 --> 09:19.517
Same with these guys too.
You remember the little, the little...

09:19.600 --> 09:21.143
-Yeah.
-You know what I'm talking about? Yeah.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.562
I'm gonna start working
on the characters.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.522
-GUIDO: Okay, perfect.
-ALE: That's a lot of work.

09:25.022 --> 09:28.526
<i>We're making two</i>
<i>life-sized iconic Marvel characters.</i>

09:28.693 --> 09:31.153
They're hard to make,
it's a huge challenge.

09:31.445 --> 09:36.158
But Ale is gonna take the lead on that
and myself and On are going to knock out

09:36.659 --> 09:40.162
the most amazing vegetables
and fruits you've ever seen.

09:40.329 --> 09:43.082
And we're gonna knock it out
with the characters, too.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.333
-Absolutely.
-Right?

09:44.417 --> 09:45.418
Yeah.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.713
Okay. A little bit more.

09:49.755 --> 09:54.760
Thai carving is very detailed
and the blade is very, very thin.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.264
Look like a pencil and on the top
on here, what you see?

09:58.514 --> 10:00.016
You can draw all the stuff.

10:00.516 --> 10:02.810
Like today, I start this one,

10:03.144 --> 10:04.687
it's not quite firm this side,

10:04.770 --> 10:08.941
but this one is, look nice and firm
and I hope this side should be good.

10:13.070 --> 10:16.407
ALE:<i> I'm giving Captain America</i>
<i>like a human color.</i>

10:16.824 --> 10:19.952
And I do this with like powdered colors,

10:20.036 --> 10:23.247
these are great, and I have to mix
them with alcohol.

10:23.372 --> 10:26.917
So my favorite is lemon extract,
but you... Like, you could use

10:27.168 --> 10:29.253
any alcohol you want,
that's edible of course.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.131
<i>You have to turn it into a liquid</i>
<i>so you can actually paint</i>

10:32.214 --> 10:35.968
<i>but you need it to dry fast,</i>
<i>and alcohol dries faster than water,</i>

10:36.469 --> 10:39.138
so therefore, we use this.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.268
SHERRY: I am making some ganache.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.980
Putting it on these sheet trays
to set up a lot quicker.

10:48.648 --> 10:52.151
'Cause the quicker it sets up,
the quicker I can start my character,

10:52.234 --> 10:56.656
Nebula, to make sure she stays all intact.

10:57.948 --> 11:00.242
RAY: <i>It's garden day all day.</i>

11:00.368 --> 11:03.454
So, I will be hip-deep
in root vegetable land.

11:04.705 --> 11:11.170
<i>My skills run the gamut from lanterns,</i>
<i>to floral, to animals,</i>

11:11.253 --> 11:15.341
<i>to all of those things.</i>
<i>I've competed for quite a number of years.</i>

11:15.508 --> 11:18.344
<i>I have medaled at every level</i>
<i>that you can have.</i>

11:18.427 --> 11:21.931
But this competition,
one of my former students

11:22.223 --> 11:26.977
gets to elevate to the stage where,
nationally, she is known.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.855
That's the greatest thing
an artist can achieve.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.608
Not that your painting or your artwork
was the best,

11:32.733 --> 11:36.362
but that someone else
stood on your shoulders

11:36.445 --> 11:37.822
and did even better.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.951
This is friggin' deep, man.
I mean, come on!

11:43.077 --> 11:48.332
RAY:<i> As the day is speedily unwinding,</i>
<i>I'm making roses out of potatoes</i>

11:48.582 --> 11:52.545
and then dipping this
into red dye number 40, double strength.

11:53.045 --> 11:57.591
This color red, coupled
with how brown the potato will turn,

11:57.800 --> 12:00.594
actually will turn these,
even more like a rose.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.304
-BENNY: How are you guys?
-Hi!

12:02.430 --> 12:03.889
-Hi!
-How are you?

12:04.098 --> 12:05.433
So how are you guys doing
with the characters?

12:05.516 --> 12:07.560
We're trying to figure out
position-wise...

12:07.643 --> 12:08.853
-BENNY: Okay, got it.
-...what to put them on.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.981
Yeah. Because you know,
Groot, Nebula, we're kind

12:12.064 --> 12:14.150
-of the perfect balance right here.
-Yeah.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.152
AMIRAH: So talk to me.
What do we have here?

12:16.277 --> 12:17.611
RACHELL: So, this is Groot.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.114
He is mini just like me.

12:20.197 --> 12:23.492
-AMIRAH: Love that.
-The head will be done with watermelon.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.827
-BENNY: Okay.
-And...

12:24.910 --> 12:26.954
-Are you hollowing it?
-We are not.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.834
It's like 90 percent water.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.795
-I know.
-So, if I was to stick a watermelon here,

12:34.879 --> 12:36.672
don't you think that water
would just start...

12:38.132 --> 12:40.968
RAY: It would if you didn't think ahead.

12:41.260 --> 12:45.306
I've already drilled the hole into it
and put paper towels inside

12:45.681 --> 12:47.183
to absorb all the moisture.

12:47.266 --> 12:51.854
Okay. I'm excited to see it.
I hope I don't see him dripping.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.856
-It's gonna be great.
-AMIRAH: I'm excited.

12:53.939 --> 12:54.982
We'll see you guys later.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.859
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.782
So, let's do like a...

13:03.199 --> 13:04.325
-go through...
-Go through some...

13:04.408 --> 13:06.202
-AMIRAH: Hi, guys!
-ALL: Hi.

13:06.577 --> 13:10.581
I'm starting to see the pose
that you were demonstrating earlier today.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.834
Yeah, yeah. Definitely,
Blaque Panther is coming in the building.

13:14.001 --> 13:17.713
What are you guys use to attach
the rice cereal into the structure?

13:18.088 --> 13:19.924
So we actually use melted marshmallows

13:20.007 --> 13:21.884
to attach the rice cereal
to the structure.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.595
-Ew!
-(LAUGHS)

13:25.012 --> 13:28.098
-Benny doesn't like that.
-Benny probably doesn't like that.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.810
-No. It's... Correct.
-No. It's not a like or dislike.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.145
It's just about... to make sure
that it's secure.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.647
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.149
It just, the marshmallow
is not the best option

13:37.650 --> 13:41.153
when you're working with such a big scale
because the weight is gonna separate it.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.614
-Yeah.
-Especially on those areas underneath.

13:43.864 --> 13:47.451
Yeah. What's interesting is that
I've actually left it a little bit hollow

13:47.535 --> 13:50.329
'cause I thought about that,
so if you take a look up under here,

13:50.496 --> 13:52.790
it's just a little bit
of armature that's there...

13:52.873 --> 13:54.208
-Yeah.
-...so that I can build the modelling

13:54.291 --> 13:57.044
chocolate and then kind of attach
to itself to avoid that sagging.

13:57.211 --> 14:00.005
Yeah. Okay.
I see some black gingerbread here.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.757
What are you using this for?

14:01.966 --> 14:04.385
This is eventually gonna turn
into Black Panther's head.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.638
When most people think of gingerbread,
they think of gingerbread houses.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.015
However, I use gingerbread differently.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.434
I like to stack it up and then carve it.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.896
The reason I have holes cut
through the middle is for weight.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.023
I anticipate that this is gonna
be very heavy,

14:18.440 --> 14:21.068
so it takes out some weight
in the middle and gives it some air

14:21.151 --> 14:24.405
while it's drying.
And once everything is carved,

14:24.613 --> 14:28.158
I will drill a hole in him
and then pop it on top.

14:28.742 --> 14:32.121
How long do you think it takes
these particular panels to get dry?

14:32.454 --> 14:38.085
So, I have made a human-sized head before
and I dried it overnight for 12 hours.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.922
So we'll see what happens
when you do it in one day.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.675
-BENNY: Oh, no.
-But what, I got till sundown, so...

14:44.758 --> 14:46.010
Okay, okay. Wow.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.262
-BENNY: We'll see you guys later.
-AMIRAH: Bye.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.231
GUIDO: I'm gonna carve
some watermelon radishes.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.357
ON: Okay.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.650
-ALE: On?
-Yeah?

15:01.942 --> 15:04.987
Do you wanna make another,
the other face?

15:05.279 --> 15:06.572
We can't get to them yet.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.825
ALE: <i>These guys are amazing carvers,</i>

15:10.075 --> 15:12.995
<i>but I think we just have to focus</i>
<i>on the characters more.</i>

15:13.495 --> 15:16.832
because essentially, that's like,
the most important part of the build.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.876
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

15:20.794 --> 15:23.422
AMIRAH:

15:29.053 --> 15:30.971
-ALE:
-BENNY:

15:38.312 --> 15:39.939
-BENNY:
-ALE:

15:41.065 --> 15:42.399
AMIRAH: So what's happening over here?

15:42.858 --> 15:46.028
We have some Thai carving.
I have some honeydew in here.

15:46.445 --> 15:47.821
-BENNY: Oh, wow.
-ON: A Thai carving.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.699
-Wow, that is some detailed work in there.
-Thank you.

15:50.824 --> 15:51.825
BENNY: Yeah.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.787
Don't forget, you still have
two main characters

15:54.912 --> 15:57.122
and you don't have a lot of time for them.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.458
They're covered. They're coming along.
They're big guys.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.128
Okay. Well, we'll leave you perfectionists
to do what you do best.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.755
-Awesome.
-Thank you so much.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.340
-Bye.
-BENNY: Thank you. Have fun.

16:09.718 --> 16:12.262
You guys, we need to work
on the characters.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.516
-You can work on the shield.
-Okay. Okay.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.810
GUIDO: We'll do it. We'll do it. Yup.

16:18.185 --> 16:19.228
<i>Ale is correct.</i>

16:19.311 --> 16:22.272
We have an insane workload
that we need to get done now.

16:22.398 --> 16:25.150
-Should we see if it sticks?
-So it is super imperative

16:25.234 --> 16:27.319
that me and On just
jump in wherever we can

16:27.403 --> 16:29.446
<i>just basically doing whatever Ale needs,</i>

16:29.571 --> 16:32.324
so that we can get these characters
done on time, perfect.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.493
On, you got the marshmallow workshop
going, right?

16:34.576 --> 16:36.245
-ON: Yeah.
-We're just gonna need to keep it going.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.288
-ON: Okay.
-We need a ton of marshmallow.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.623
(ALE GROANS)

16:39.832 --> 16:42.042
ON: Getting there.
Now we see a little bit of project.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.295
-BLAQUE: Well, you added a zipper?
-JESSE: Mm-hmm.

16:45.462 --> 16:48.215
I'm gonna hit like, this will be metallic,
this will be metallic.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.341
BLAQUE: I love it.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.177
JESSE: I kinda want him to have like
the... so they only have three hands

16:52.344 --> 16:53.512
-but...
-BLAQUE: Three fingers?

16:53.595 --> 16:55.347
-JESSE: Four, yeah. Four fingers.
-'Cause if they have three hands,

16:55.431 --> 16:56.640
I might stay away from him.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.226
-(JESSE LAUGHS)
-Little bit patchy in it.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.271
ALE: We need to make sure
the rice cereal is not gonna fall.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.064
What do you wanna...
Do you wanna do modeling chocolate,

17:04.148 --> 17:06.358
or you wanna do fondant?
'Cause fondant, if we roll it out,

17:06.442 --> 17:09.028
it's gonna be...
We can get quicker coverage.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.613
Yeah, he's already sliding a little bit.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.907
I really wish there was some form of fruit

17:13.991 --> 17:16.744
or vegetable that was large enough
that I could carve these guys out of.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.955
<i>But the cool part with using</i>
<i>other methods is, I'm learning.</i>

17:20.164 --> 17:23.208
Not the most ideal time to learn
but I'm learning something fun and new.

17:24.626 --> 17:25.794
ON: Whoo!

17:25.961 --> 17:28.297
-I love you, Tony!
-Yeah. Yeah.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.301
KEKE: <i>The sun is almost across the sky.</i>

17:33.093 --> 17:35.846
Obviously, The Misfits
are doing Black Panther and Rocket.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.556
-Yeah.
-From a technical point of view,

17:37.639 --> 17:39.016
I wanna hear your thoughts.

17:39.224 --> 17:42.311
I'm a little bit worried about the fact
that they used marshmallows

17:42.394 --> 17:44.688
<i>to attach the rice cereal</i>
<i>into the structure.</i>

17:45.314 --> 17:49.318
Definitely. But I do think that he did
give it a good amount of time to sort of,

17:49.693 --> 17:51.695
dry up before he started adding layers.

17:51.945 --> 17:54.490
I gotta say it, I'm nervous
about that gingerbread.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.993
AMIRAH: <i>Look, done correctly,</i>
<i>it can be a stunning showpiece.</i>

17:58.410 --> 18:00.913
<i>But if you carve something</i>
<i>like a gingerbread,</i>

18:01.163 --> 18:03.373
unlike a rice cereal
or modeling chocolate

18:03.457 --> 18:06.001
or anything, if that thing cracks,
you have nothing.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.921
So, I just hope that they have a plan B

18:09.004 --> 18:11.632
or that she's just
an amazing gingerbread carver.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.926
KEKE: Yeah. Now, let's talk
about Anything Is Possible.

18:14.051 --> 18:17.012
Because some things aren't possible
when we got to save the universe.

18:17.846 --> 18:22.726
They have two humans that are similar
in size and similar in shape.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.855
<i>The challenging part here is,</i>
<i>it sort of amplifies mistakes</i>

18:26.980 --> 18:28.982
<i>when you are mirroring something in a way.</i>

18:29.274 --> 18:32.152
But I have to say, the face
of Captain America is looking really good

18:32.236 --> 18:34.571
<i>and so far, they're the only one</i>
<i>with the face done.</i>

18:34.655 --> 18:35.697
-AMIRAH: <i>Yes.</i>
-KEKE:<i> Yup.</i>

18:35.823 --> 18:38.033
Now, let's talk about 2 Foxes & A Relic.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.370
<i>We don't have hands on Nebula.</i>
<i>We don't have heads on Groot.</i>

18:41.662 --> 18:44.790
I'm still really worried
about the watermelon head for Groot.

18:45.040 --> 18:49.920
I mean, if the water get in touch
with the actual body,

18:50.462 --> 18:54.383
<i>it's gonna melt the sugar,</i>
<i>it's gonna destroy layers of gingerbread</i>

18:54.466 --> 18:57.511
<i>that they were gonna add into the body.</i>
<i>So it's gonna be a mess.</i>

18:57.594 --> 18:58.887
KEKE: <i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

18:59.054 --> 19:00.722
Maybe he gonna show y'all something new.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.308
-Maybe.
-I'm ready to be impressed.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.146
All I know is, we are running out of time
and the universe needs us.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.731
So they better figure it out fast.

19:13.527 --> 19:16.780
NARRATOR:<i> As the food artists race</i>
<i>to summon the Avengers before sunset,</i>

19:17.739 --> 19:21.201
<i>our Sorceress awaits backup</i>
<i>in the battle against the alien horde.</i>

19:22.744 --> 19:27.583
Oh! Things are looking mighty grim,
the alien force is taking over the city.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.002
-Where are the Avengers?
-NARRATOR:<i> They're on their way.</i>

19:30.210 --> 19:32.588
<i>Meanwhile, I've located the source</i>
<i>of the aliens' power</i>

19:32.671 --> 19:34.548
<i>but we need something strong enough</i>
<i>to destroy it.</i>

19:34.798 --> 19:38.218
Yes. We need something
that can change time, affect space

19:38.343 --> 19:40.762
and change and alter the fabric
of life itself.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.306
NARRATOR: <i>The Infinity Stones.</i>

19:42.514 --> 19:45.934
Huh? Oh, yes. The Infinity Stones.
This is great thinking.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.561
-Good idea.
-NARRATOR: <i>What were you gonna say?</i>

19:47.978 --> 19:50.856
Music. You ever listen to a good tune
and just get sent, man?

19:51.106 --> 19:54.109
Never underestimate the power
of a good song. But the Infinity Stones,

19:54.276 --> 19:56.528
it's a way better idea
and we should do that.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.363
NARRATOR: <i>What are you doing?</i>

19:58.947 --> 20:00.866
Looking for the Infinity Stones, duh.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.659
NARRATOR: <i>You have the Infinity Stones</i>
<i>in your pocket?</i>

20:02.743 --> 20:05.329
I mean, I thought I did. But let's see.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.206
I had them when I went
to the drive-thru,

20:07.289 --> 20:08.874
and I knew I had them
before I left the post office...

20:08.957 --> 20:10.000
NARRATOR: <i>Oh, boy.</i>

20:12.878 --> 20:16.965
Now, do you have something we can use
to harness it's awesome powers?

20:17.049 --> 20:19.051
A gauntlet, a spear, anything?

20:19.134 --> 20:21.929
NARRATOR: <i>No. But I think I know where</i>
<i>we might get some help.</i>

20:23.513 --> 20:26.391
Oh, my goodness.
I feel like a sorceress myself,

20:26.475 --> 20:28.727
the way I'm stirring
my cauldron of ganache.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.481
(BOTH LAUGH)

20:37.486 --> 20:40.447
Artists, the plot has thickened.

20:40.948 --> 20:44.493
Turns out the only way to help
our Sorceress stop the invasion

20:44.576 --> 20:46.620
is to use an Infinity Stone.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.789
-Oh, man.
-KEKE: You'll also have to find

20:48.872 --> 20:51.041
a creative way to harness
your stone's power.

20:51.458 --> 20:55.337
Thanos had his gauntlet.
Dr. Strange has the Eye of Agamotto.

20:55.420 --> 20:59.341
You have to create your own
original vessel to place your stone in.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.302
Get to it.
The sun isn't just setting on us,

21:02.678 --> 21:05.514
it's setting on the entire planet
if we don't get this done.

21:05.847 --> 21:08.433
Like our Sorceress said,
"Time is running out!"

21:09.434 --> 21:10.435
I have an idea.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.271
-All right.
-Awesome.

21:12.437 --> 21:13.522
The plot has just thickened.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.524
We gotta create an Infinity Stone.
What are your thoughts?

21:15.691 --> 21:18.235
Fortunately, I'm super confident
in my team.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.404
Have you ever seen books that are like,
meant to disguise things?

21:20.570 --> 21:23.615
They look like a book, but you open it up
and it's like, got a square cut out of it?

21:23.824 --> 21:24.908
-Like the safe kinda thing?
-Yeah.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.994
Do we wanna put it like that
or do we wanna make it,

21:27.077 --> 21:29.454
so that it's on the cover,
so that you can kind of recognize...

21:29.538 --> 21:32.749
<i>that it's a book with a stone in it.</i>
<i>Like a super ornate book</i>

21:32.874 --> 21:34.459
<i>-that looks out of place.</i>
-JESSE: <i>Okay, okay.</i>

21:34.626 --> 21:36.795
So I think that we're just gonna
take something that's quick setting,

21:36.878 --> 21:39.047
using isomalt.
Kind of give it a custom tint

21:39.131 --> 21:41.216
<i>and I wanna knock it out of the way,</i>
<i>so I don't forget about it.</i>

21:41.341 --> 21:46.263
So I was thinking, an abstract honeydew

21:46.596 --> 21:50.142
<i>or watermelon carving.</i>
<i>And we can make a gem</i>

21:50.225 --> 21:52.019
<i>maybe out of isomalt.</i>

21:52.477 --> 21:53.478
All right. Well, let's go.

21:53.562 --> 21:54.688
-All right.
-Come on, Sherry.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.400
ALE: Okay, so we have something
translucent made of isomalt.

21:58.608 --> 22:03.155
<i>One of you carves an amazing fruit</i>
<i>or vegetable and contains it.</i>

22:03.238 --> 22:04.781
GUIDO:<i> We all know that</i>
<i>the Infinity Stones are important,</i>

22:05.032 --> 22:08.994
<i>but as a group, we still have a lot to add</i>
<i>to these characters.</i>

22:09.077 --> 22:11.580
So it just adds a little bit more pressure
that we just need to work through.

22:11.955 --> 22:14.333
Yeah, so you just keep going
with what you're doing.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.459
ON: Okay.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.295
Do we want this into a particular shape?

22:18.545 --> 22:20.047
STACY: Like a round, chunky stone.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.841
Hello, Misfits. How's it going?

22:22.924 --> 22:24.968
-The plot did thicken.
-KEKE: Thickens. (LAUGHS)

22:25.093 --> 22:26.595
What Infinity Stone are you gonna use?

22:26.720 --> 22:28.847
We decided to create
our own Infinity Stone.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.265
-KEKE: Oh, you did?
-Yeah,

22:30.349 --> 22:31.600
we gonna call it the Knowledge Stone.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.935
-That's a good name.
-Knowledge is power.

22:34.102 --> 22:36.021
See, I've already tinted
our isomalt here

22:36.104 --> 22:37.314
-kind of a gold.
-KEKE: Oh, wait a minute.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.441
-So, you're already getting started?
-I'm already started.

22:39.524 --> 22:42.569
All right, well, I'm gonna leave you guys
to it and catch in with you later.

22:42.652 --> 22:43.653
-Thank you.
-BENNY: Bye guys.

22:43.737 --> 22:44.780
JESSE: Bye, guys, thanks.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.825
(SPEAKING IN FRENCH)

22:50.285 --> 22:52.704
That means my feet are very tired.

22:53.163 --> 22:57.000
What I love most about Nebula
is that she's a little different,

22:57.209 --> 22:58.710
she's a little misunderstood.

22:58.960 --> 23:03.090
I think that a lot of that applies
to who I am.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.424
(SPEAKING IN FRENCH)

23:04.549 --> 23:07.177
(LAUGHS)

23:07.386 --> 23:11.098
The scary part about Nebula
is I'm running out of time

23:11.181 --> 23:14.976
and we have to make a vessel
for the Infinity Stone.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.145
Where was I? All right.

23:17.896 --> 23:22.275
We're going to do a carving,
using some cantaloupe and watermelon.

23:23.568 --> 23:26.988
<i>Back in the day, I had no idea</i>
<i>what I was doing,</i>

23:28.281 --> 23:30.200
<i>and so you fake it till you make it.</i>

23:30.325 --> 23:34.454
<i>And now roughly 45 years later,</i>
<i>I'm a little bit closer,</i>

23:34.538 --> 23:36.873
<i>not quite there yet,</i>
<i>but I'm getting there.</i>

23:37.833 --> 23:39.751
We are making Groot's

23:40.168 --> 23:42.295
texture out of gingerbread.

23:42.838 --> 23:46.425
<i>I am rolling it out super thin.</i>
<i>I will be impressioning it</i>

23:46.508 --> 23:48.969
<i>with this fondant mat</i>
<i>that will look like tree bark.</i>

23:50.178 --> 23:51.221
<i>I bake it.</i>

23:51.596 --> 23:52.722
-Cookies are done.
-Cookies are done.

23:53.056 --> 23:54.474
SHERRY: Cookies are done.

23:55.183 --> 23:59.062
RACHELL: <i>And then I will be placing it</i>
<i>as it's hot over this PVC</i>

23:59.229 --> 24:00.355
<i>to form the shape.</i>

24:00.439 --> 24:01.940
Look at that curve there, I mean,

24:02.107 --> 24:03.859
that'll just add more dimension.
It's great.

24:03.984 --> 24:07.487
And then I'll break off pieces
and layer as I go with fondant.

24:07.571 --> 24:08.697
This is a big moment,

24:08.780 --> 24:11.074
-we're putting gingerbread...
-RAY: You got my undivided attention here.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.411
Okay, come on, make this happen.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.295
-There it is.
-SHERRY: Wow.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.463
Come on.

24:24.546 --> 24:27.174
-RAY: I'm liking it.
-SHERRY: I love it.

24:27.257 --> 24:29.384
-RACHELL: Thank you.
-RAY: Oh, my God.

24:29.509 --> 24:31.261
That is like, that's out there.

24:31.344 --> 24:33.680
-Thank you. Thank you.
-RAY: I mean like way past Pluto.

24:33.972 --> 24:36.391
(LAUGHS)

24:39.644 --> 24:42.314
JESSE:<i> We loved bringing Black Panther</i>
<i>and Rocket together</i>

24:42.481 --> 24:45.233
because they don't immediately
feel like they should be together.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.195
They are misfits,
they kind of embody our team dynamic.

24:49.863 --> 24:53.909
Black Panther is such an iconic character
especially to the Black community

24:54.034 --> 24:58.205
<i>and for me to be able to recreate</i>
<i>a superhero that looks like me.</i>

24:58.580 --> 24:59.956
That's incredible.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.292
This is a dream come true.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.544
I'll airbrush him black in a few places.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.796
Then we're just waiting
for Black Panther's head.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.381
That's the moment of truth.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.052
My goodness! How is it going?

25:13.053 --> 25:18.266
I'm feeling okay. I started out
with 20 gingerbread pieces.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.227
You can kind of see
the different layers here.

25:20.393 --> 25:25.857
I have "glued" them together
with royal icing. It's dry-ish...

25:26.483 --> 25:27.776
Is there a plan B?

25:28.735 --> 25:29.736
No, ma'am.

25:30.111 --> 25:31.571
-Okay.
-All right.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.281
-I got this. I got this.
-BENNY: Okay.

25:33.490 --> 25:36.952
STACY: <i>I'm gonna be carving it</i>
<i>with my favorite serrated knives,</i>

25:38.036 --> 25:39.120
<i>Dremels.</i>

25:41.706 --> 25:42.832
<i>Just going to town.</i>

25:42.958 --> 25:44.543
Come on, bud. Come on.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.044
If I make one wrong cut,

25:46.211 --> 25:48.713
<i>it's over. I can't just patch</i>
<i>on some more gingerbread.</i>

25:48.838 --> 25:50.215
<i>Every little cut matters.</i>

25:51.508 --> 25:53.760
Now, if this work, it's gonna be amazing.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.262
If it doesn't work...

25:55.720 --> 25:56.888
AMIRAH: <i>Look, it's really risky,</i>

25:57.180 --> 26:00.475
<i>they've sort of let go</i>
<i>of one entire team member.</i>

26:00.600 --> 26:02.269
And if that head doesn't work,

26:02.394 --> 26:04.437
you've just lost a team member
for no reason.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.564
All right.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.529
AMIRAH:<i> Okay. Anything Is Possible.</i>

26:12.654 --> 26:14.698
She did an excellent job
with the head too.

26:14.781 --> 26:16.074
ALE: Guido, want to help me
put the head on?

26:16.157 --> 26:17.158
GUIDO: Oh, yeah.

26:17.325 --> 26:20.078
Actually, I think they're going to measure
the head, right now.

26:20.203 --> 26:21.538
BENNY: Yeah, they're gonna
cut the head now.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.081
GUIDO: You good?

26:24.583 --> 26:26.001
AMIRAH: Do you think it's gonna work?

26:26.167 --> 26:29.588
-Uh... I am not sure. It's gonna make...
-AMIRAH: Oh, my gosh.

26:29.921 --> 26:30.922
What is happening?

26:33.341 --> 26:35.635
Did we not cut the hole big enough?
It's too late now.

26:35.719 --> 26:38.096
I don't think they tried to put
the head before...

26:38.179 --> 26:40.223
(GASPS) She's pushing it from the top...

26:41.349 --> 26:43.852
-Oh, my God.
-She's gonna destroy the work on top.

26:44.019 --> 26:47.230
AMIRAH: Look at this, they're treating it
as if it was a plastic toy.

26:47.314 --> 26:48.565
BENNY: Oh, my God.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.150
Okay, it seems like she's done.

26:50.483 --> 26:53.403
-It's good.
-Wow. Very bold movements.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.697
-That was a huge risk.
-AMIRAH: Definitely.

27:00.535 --> 27:03.330
KEKE: <i>All right, guys.</i>
<i>The sun is getting really low.</i>

27:03.663 --> 27:05.040
One hour, people.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.042
-Oh, my goodness!
-(GROANS)

27:07.208 --> 27:08.835
Keep fighting the good fight!

27:11.421 --> 27:15.133
RAY: <i>All I need to do is cover a six foot</i>
<i>in diameter ring</i>

27:15.383 --> 27:17.510
<i>with this shaved daikon radish.</i>

27:19.054 --> 27:21.848
Oh, wow, that really seriously
looks amazing.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.436
RACHELL:
I still have some pieces left to put on.

27:26.936 --> 27:29.939
SHERRY: I think we really need
to start on the heads

27:30.065 --> 27:33.610
because I mean, Amirah and Benny
were concerned about that.

27:33.860 --> 27:35.153
With the watermelon, I know.

27:35.487 --> 27:39.449
That's your character and you just need
to not be worried about speaking up.

27:39.532 --> 27:41.743
-I mean, this is your thing.
-I know.

27:42.369 --> 27:47.332
We have two options. We can either keep
the watermelon head idea or we can switch

27:47.415 --> 27:52.796
and have a chocolate head covered
with fondant and layered with gingerbread.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.923
-Hey, Chef!
-Yeah?

27:55.131 --> 27:58.677
With the watermelon, um, I feel like...

27:59.386 --> 28:01.680
maybe we should go a different route.

28:02.055 --> 28:05.392
Well, I'm still sayin'
the watermelon would work,

28:05.684 --> 28:09.896
but it's time to just pass the torch,
so to speak.

28:10.230 --> 28:12.148
So you use your best judgement.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.359
Okay. Sounds good, Chef.

28:14.734 --> 28:16.903
RAY:<i> As a teacher, as a mentor, it's not,</i>

28:17.028 --> 28:20.323
"I'm gonna achieve all of this
in the world and take it to my grave."

28:20.782 --> 28:24.035
You are to achieve this much
and then pass it on.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.287
-So what are you doing?
-RACHELL: I think I'm gonna go

28:26.371 --> 28:27.622
with the chocolate head.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.165
Let it dry out a bit.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.709
I'm gonna start her face.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.586
Come on, ladies, speed it up here,
get your heads done.

28:34.295 --> 28:35.672
ON: Let's go, team. Let's go.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.173
ALE: Grab some Isomalt.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.384
-ON: Let me see the cantaloupe.
-We still have a lot to do,

28:39.634 --> 28:41.344
<i>but we have to build our stone.</i>

28:41.469 --> 28:43.471
Ooh! What color do you want? Purple?

28:43.596 --> 28:44.848
The lights are colored.

28:44.931 --> 28:47.434
For our Infinity Stone,
I'm going to melt some isomalt.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.060
<i>I get to use the blow torch.</i>

28:49.144 --> 28:50.979
Because I wanna play with the blow torch.

28:51.646 --> 28:54.441
<i>The vessel for it is gonna be</i>
<i>a floral cantaloupe.</i>

28:54.649 --> 28:57.485
We're gonna keep the center
not intact so that we can put

28:57.569 --> 28:58.737
an LED flashing light in it,

28:59.028 --> 29:03.366
and then I am going to melt some isomalt
and we're going to cover it in that.

29:07.829 --> 29:08.913
JESSE: All right.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.082
Blaque, we want the yellow
of the street done first, right?

29:11.207 --> 29:13.042
-BLAQUE: Yeah, let's do it right now.
-JESSE: Let's do it right now.

29:13.126 --> 29:14.127
BLAQUE: I can start pouring yellow.

29:14.210 --> 29:17.547
For the street and the asphalt we're gonna
be using black-eyed peas and lentils.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.424
-JESSE: Are we doin’ the CK?
-BLAQUE: Yeah.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.050
-JESSE: Okay.
-BLAQUE: Stacy!

29:21.176 --> 29:22.218
What's up?

29:22.302 --> 29:23.928
BLAQUE: She's pouring corn syrup
on the base.

29:24.095 --> 29:26.264
You will have a hard time
putting that head on.

29:26.347 --> 29:28.975
-I'm almost there.
-BLAQUE: We need you.

29:30.059 --> 29:33.062
I've been working on the head
this entire time and I'm finally finished.

29:33.229 --> 29:35.857
-This is a face.
-BLAQUE: Okay, yeah, put it on the body.

29:35.940 --> 29:36.941
(BLAQUE LAUGHS)

29:37.066 --> 29:39.944
STACY: <i>All I can think about is I just</i>
<i>hope that the judges can appreciate</i>

29:40.278 --> 29:42.071
the technique and the effort that went in.

29:42.363 --> 29:43.406
All right. Here it comes.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.285
I think I've got it. You keep...

29:48.036 --> 29:49.579
SHERRY: Oh! Wow, guys.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.706
That's amazing.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.542
Can you go look at it from the front?

29:57.712 --> 29:59.088
STACY:
It should probably tilt down a little.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.257
Okay, can you grab me
the modelling chocolate?

30:02.383 --> 30:03.384
In the micro...

30:03.718 --> 30:05.011
-Stacy!
-Oh, Stacy!

30:09.766 --> 30:12.602
Oh, my God! It broke.

30:13.728 --> 30:16.648
She's been working
on that head for like, seven hours.

30:16.815 --> 30:20.819
It's okay. Just grab modelling chocolate
in the microwave.

30:21.986 --> 30:24.656
I saw it fall off. Oh, my God.

30:24.739 --> 30:26.282
-BLAQUE: Is it melted?
-STACY: I'm coming. I'm coming.

30:26.407 --> 30:27.992
-BLAQUE: Shove it on this pole.
-STACY: Okay.

30:28.368 --> 30:30.411
I need some more,
'cause I'm gonna use it as glue.

30:31.162 --> 30:33.581
Do we... we need freeze spray,
we need something. 'Cause I can't.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.208
We don't have...

30:35.667 --> 30:38.461
Does anybody have some cold spray
we can borrow?

30:38.837 --> 30:40.672
Yes. It's right here.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.050
JESSE: Rocker. Behind.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.596
BLAQUE: Okay.
Do we have more modelling chocolate?

30:48.805 --> 30:51.099
-STACY: There's some here.
-BLAQUE: Just use it as glue.

30:51.307 --> 30:54.185
Literally, the sun is going down.
We got minutes.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.603
I'm so sorry, guys.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.731
Pull it... look at me.
You good, this is a beautiful head.

30:59.065 --> 31:01.651
We're a team, so we gonna make sure
that this works.

31:01.818 --> 31:05.071
All right, you guys.
One minute before it's time.

31:05.947 --> 31:08.449
Oh, my God. There's not enough time.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.410
Coming. Getting the fruit.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.453
BLAQUE: Okay. Come on.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.038
JESSE: Can I grab you anything else?

31:14.747 --> 31:15.957
A miracle.

31:21.963 --> 31:25.049
-GUIDO: Our stone's done, Ale.
-Beautiful. Oh, my gosh.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.551
GUIDO: We need to get everything on.

31:26.926 --> 31:29.137
JESSE: Just wanna pack
that whole thing in.

31:29.929 --> 31:31.055
It's okay. Babe, It's okay.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.725
Five seconds, artists.
Y'all got it. Y'all got it.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.727
-ALE: That's looking great, On.
-ON: Thank you.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.645
-Three.
-Thank you, Nebula.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.606
-Two,
-GUIDO: Push the shield back.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.442
KEKE: <i>One! Sun is set</i>

31:42.525 --> 31:45.862
and your time is up! Tools down!

31:46.321 --> 31:48.281
(ALL CHEER)

31:51.326 --> 31:54.787
JESSE:

31:58.791 --> 32:01.127
Hello, 2 Foxes And A Relic.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.295
ALL: Hello.

32:02.462 --> 32:05.423
Oh, my gosh. You guys, I'm so excited
to dive into this foodscape.

32:05.548 --> 32:08.301
Please walk me
through the story of your foodscape.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.678
Oh, my goodness. I got this. I think.

32:12.305 --> 32:14.432
<i>To help the Sorceress in her battle,</i>

32:14.515 --> 32:18.227
<i>Groot and Nebula came</i>
<i>through the portal to save the city.</i>

32:18.519 --> 32:22.857
<i>Groot who is, of course,</i>
<i>all knowledgeable, decided to take Nebula</i>

32:22.941 --> 32:25.234
<i>who's always on the good, bad fence</i>

32:25.485 --> 32:28.738
<i>to an environment that would be peaceful</i>
<i>that would clear her mind.</i>

32:28.988 --> 32:32.825
The portal has the daikon radish
sheeted and wrapped around.

32:33.242 --> 32:35.286
<i>Groot is made of rice cereal treat</i>

32:35.411 --> 32:37.914
<i>marshmallow, gingerbread, chocolate.</i>

32:38.164 --> 32:41.167
Nebula is rice cereal treats, cake

32:41.668 --> 32:45.296
<i>ganache, modelling chocolate,</i>
<i>fondant, isomalt,</i>

32:45.505 --> 32:47.632
-lot of good jazz in there.
-KEKE: Hmm.

32:47.924 --> 32:48.967
RAY: <i>The various flowers</i>

32:49.050 --> 32:52.220
<i>are made out of daikon radish,</i>
<i>zucchini spears,</i>

32:52.428 --> 32:54.430
<i>carrots, turnips, and rutabagas.</i>

32:54.806 --> 32:58.768
There's two hummingbirds actually
out of okra, right there,

32:58.935 --> 33:02.689
<i>and then lots of zucchini leaves all over.</i>

33:03.606 --> 33:07.276
This display has some of the most
beautiful carved flowers I've seen.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.028
-Beautiful.
-God bless your hands.

33:09.153 --> 33:10.154
Thank you.

33:10.238 --> 33:15.159
AMIRAH: <i>Bringing Groot and Nebula</i>
<i>into this garden is so great, story wise,</i>

33:15.284 --> 33:17.453
<i>because you are sort of playing</i>
<i>to the fact</i>

33:17.620 --> 33:19.330
that Groot is pulling her
onto the good side.

33:19.580 --> 33:23.126
We need to save the city and I know
we spoke a lot about posture.

33:23.292 --> 33:26.921
While Groot is one of the coolest textures
I've ever seen,

33:27.130 --> 33:33.344
I do wish that he didn't look so down,
but more uplifting to Nebula.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.596
I mean I was worrying at the beginning
remember, with the...

33:35.680 --> 33:37.515
-Yeah.
-...use of the watermelon for the head.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.934
So I'm glad that you moved
in a different direction.

33:40.059 --> 33:41.060
Thank you.

33:41.227 --> 33:43.229
Going into Nebula, the hands

33:43.896 --> 33:46.482
<i>seems too small</i>
<i>for the proportions of the body,</i>

33:46.733 --> 33:49.944
same as the head,
but what I like about her

33:50.028 --> 33:54.407
is just her expression
and you guys got the correct proportion

33:54.574 --> 33:56.117
<i>from these both characters.</i>

33:56.743 --> 34:00.705
Of course, the plot thickened and you guys
had to create an Infinity Stone

34:00.788 --> 34:03.249
-with a vessel.
-It's the Key Stone.

34:03.541 --> 34:06.294
<i>KE which stands</i>
<i>for “Knowledge Everlasting.”</i>

34:06.502 --> 34:08.713
<i>We gave the stone an amber color</i>

34:08.796 --> 34:11.424
<i>and the light that's inside</i>
<i>is the light of knowledge.</i>

34:11.591 --> 34:13.468
Those roses are stunning.

34:13.593 --> 34:16.554
<i>The fact that you just carved each flowers</i>
<i>out of potato, no?</i>

34:16.679 --> 34:21.184
RAY: <i>Yes. Each one is half a potato carved</i>
<i>and they will last forever.</i>

34:21.726 --> 34:24.145
And what did you actually make
the Infinity Stone out of?

34:24.270 --> 34:25.313
Colored poured sugar.

34:25.396 --> 34:28.357
All right, I mean I need to get my hands
on the Key Stone.

34:28.441 --> 34:30.651
-(ALL LAUGH)
-KEKE: Awesome job.

34:30.735 --> 34:31.736
-Thank you.
-SHERRY: Thank you.

34:33.279 --> 34:34.530
-Hello, hello.
-Hello.

34:34.614 --> 34:35.615
-Hello.
-Hi, guys.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.825
-How's it going, Anything Is Possible?
-Good.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.327
-Feels good. Exciting. Yeah.
-Amazing.

34:39.535 --> 34:42.163
Please walk me
through the story of your foodscape.

34:44.082 --> 34:46.250
ALE: <i>The Sorceress needed help</i>
<i>from the Avengers,</i>

34:46.334 --> 34:49.587
<i>so we built Captain America</i>
<i>and Iron Man coming out of a portal</i>

34:49.796 --> 34:52.090
<i>landing in a beautiful garden</i>
<i>to save the city.</i>

34:53.424 --> 34:55.510
<i>Both of them are made</i>
<i>out of rice cereal treats</i>

34:55.718 --> 34:59.055
<i>covered with ganache,</i>
<i>we used both modelling chocolate</i>

34:59.180 --> 35:00.807
<i>and fondant to cover them.</i>

35:01.349 --> 35:03.935
<i>To paint them we airbrushed,</i>
<i>we painted by hand,</i>

35:04.018 --> 35:05.853
<i>we used gel coloring and powders.</i>

35:06.062 --> 35:08.606
GUIDO: <i>The portal, what we did</i>
<i>was we covered it in</i>

35:08.689 --> 35:11.609
<i>royal icing and then I airbrushed</i>
<i>angel hair pasta</i>

35:11.692 --> 35:14.028
<i>to try to get that fire spark effect</i>
<i>to happen.</i>

35:14.195 --> 35:18.282
The story is there. They are coming
through an actual Marvel portal.

35:18.407 --> 35:22.161
<i>The use of color that you did there</i>
<i>to bring it to life like this</i>

35:22.245 --> 35:23.830
<i>where it does look like it's lit.</i>

35:24.038 --> 35:27.250
That is the best
Marvel portal we have here today.

35:27.583 --> 35:28.584
Wow.

35:28.960 --> 35:33.381
The garden, we have some beautiful
Thai carving, honeydew melon.

35:33.464 --> 35:37.093
<i>We have a dragon fruit</i>
<i>and kumquat and radish.</i>

35:37.343 --> 35:40.138
You guys were perfectionist
in the carving details.

35:40.304 --> 35:42.557
<i>The precision that you need to have,</i>

35:42.765 --> 35:45.560
I mean they are stunning.
There are some issues

35:45.726 --> 35:47.895
with the proportions on the body,

35:48.146 --> 35:52.150
but hey, be proud.
Both faces are very good.

35:53.109 --> 35:55.862
KEKE: <i>Now, of course, you had to create</i>
<i>an Infinity Stone</i>

35:55.987 --> 35:58.531
as well as the vessel
for the Infinity Stone.

35:58.739 --> 36:02.326
GUIDO: <i>Our Infinity Stone is made</i>
<i>out of a cantaloupe and isomalt</i>

36:02.410 --> 36:05.246
with a multicolor light inside
and it is called...

36:05.371 --> 36:06.622
(SPEAKING IN THAI)

36:06.789 --> 36:09.125
-Which is Thai for "Treasure."
-Treasure.

36:09.333 --> 36:11.836
ALE:<i> It gives water to whoever touches it.</i>

36:12.003 --> 36:15.047
The fact that you're using
it for water as the power

36:15.131 --> 36:18.551
but you've also used water
in your feature, that's stunning.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.554
<i>You know, this is</i>
<i>the first time we see running water...</i>

36:21.762 --> 36:23.890
-KEKE: Yes.
-...in an entire foodscape and I feel like

36:23.973 --> 36:25.808
it really ties your story together.

36:26.517 --> 36:29.937
All right, you guys. Beautiful job
and we'll talk to you in just a bit.

36:30.271 --> 36:31.480
-BENNY: See you guys later.
-Thank you.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.108
What's happening, Misfits?

36:34.275 --> 36:35.401
-What's up? Hey!
-Hey.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.820
Please, walk me
through the story of your foodscape.

36:42.825 --> 36:44.785
BLAQUE:<i> The Sorceress needs</i>
<i>the Avengers' help,</i>

36:44.994 --> 36:47.788
so we've decided to bring Black Panther
and Rocket

36:47.872 --> 36:51.959
<i>through our portal in order</i>
<i>to help save the city from evil.</i>

36:52.501 --> 36:54.545
JESSE:
<i>Rocket is built from rice cereal treats</i>

36:54.629 --> 36:56.047
<i>and black pipe for support</i>

36:56.339 --> 36:58.216
<i>and then he's covered</i>
<i>in modelling chocolate</i>

36:58.299 --> 37:01.469
and then he's got little
vermicelli rice noodles as his whiskers.

37:01.969 --> 37:06.015
BLAQUE:<i> Moving on to Black Panther,</i>
<i>he's actually made of rice cereal treat,</i>

37:06.140 --> 37:08.351
<i>fondant and modelling chocolate.</i>

37:08.935 --> 37:12.230
And of course gingerbread for the head
with my 3D carving technique.

37:13.773 --> 37:16.400
Stacy, you really took
the challenge on stacking up

37:16.484 --> 37:20.029
all these gingerbreads and creating
the entire Black Panther mask.

37:20.154 --> 37:22.281
The higher the risk, the higher the reward

37:22.698 --> 37:25.743
and unfortunately, in this case,
the further I fell.

37:26.619 --> 37:30.581
I saw that very moment and my heart
dropped, boom!

37:30.998 --> 37:36.587
I was like, "No!" Because I know that
you spent so many hours on that head.

37:36.879 --> 37:40.299
There was five minutes left, you know,
and they had to stop their work and help.

37:40.383 --> 37:42.385
At the end there was just
all of this guilt,

37:42.468 --> 37:46.305
like I had let them down, not to mention,
I wanted to do Black Panther justice.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.349
Don't be so hard on yourself.

37:48.516 --> 37:51.560
It's about the recovery too
and it's there.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.104
And it looks amazing.

37:53.980 --> 37:57.108
This is an amazing piece,
I love a lot of things about it.

37:57.275 --> 38:01.404
<i>Rocket, it is really hard to create</i>
<i>a posture on animals.</i>

38:01.529 --> 38:04.282
<i>Black Panther, same case.</i>
<i>The fact that you were</i>

38:04.407 --> 38:08.202
able to give them that actual motion,
it's just perfectly done.

38:08.411 --> 38:09.412
Thank you.

38:09.537 --> 38:13.833
Knowing that you guys can create this
and just knowing what you, Blaque, can...

38:14.500 --> 38:16.961
-Blaque Panther can create.
-(ALL LAUGH)

38:17.211 --> 38:19.588
I think I just expected more
out of the portal.

38:19.755 --> 38:22.550
The fact that I'm seeing a lot
of the zip ties and a little bit

38:22.633 --> 38:24.302
of the non-food elements.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.595
-Yeah.
-Of course the plot thickened,

38:26.721 --> 38:29.515
you had to create
an Infinity Stone within a vessel.

38:29.724 --> 38:33.394
We decided to create a new Infinity Stone
called the Knowledge Stone

38:33.519 --> 38:36.314
and where better to find knowledge
than nestled in a book.

38:36.397 --> 38:38.733
BLAQUE: <i>Incorporating the books,</i>
<i>thinking back to, kind of like,</i>

38:38.816 --> 38:41.485
<i>chapters of like Black history,</i>
<i>in a sense.</i>

38:41.694 --> 38:44.947
I was in New York. I recognize
this pavement. I know what this is.

38:46.032 --> 38:50.411
I appreciate you guys for taking
that chance to say something powerful.

38:50.828 --> 38:54.623
We also spoke about what
they're representing in their posture,

38:54.749 --> 38:57.668
in their stance
and not only can I see that,

38:57.793 --> 39:00.838
but I can also see
where your stance is in this movement.

39:01.088 --> 39:04.675
And I think that is just so deep,
so special, I mean...

39:04.800 --> 39:07.011
-You're gonna make me...
-KEKE: I just wanna ask you, Blaque,

39:07.178 --> 39:09.472
because I see you getting emotional,
so I just wanna ask you

39:09.555 --> 39:10.639
what's it you're going through?

39:10.973 --> 39:12.058
Um...

39:12.683 --> 39:14.268
-Being Black...
-Yes.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.980
...and making the first iconic
Black superhero, that's something,

39:18.147 --> 39:19.648
that's so much pressure.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.652
It just feels good.
Making a nod to culture.

39:24.820 --> 39:26.322
Yeah, it just feels really good.

39:27.281 --> 39:30.534
I know it feels good to me too
because it feels like you're being seen

39:30.701 --> 39:33.537
and you're getting
the opportunity to speak

39:33.829 --> 39:35.915
and show your heart and show your voice,

39:36.207 --> 39:38.209
you know, I know what
it's like to be Black.

39:39.043 --> 39:41.879
So, you know, it's important
to be able to feel like

39:41.962 --> 39:44.382
you're able to say what's important to you

39:44.548 --> 39:46.884
and express art in a way that's moving.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.178
That's what we are hoping to see
on <i>Foodtastic,</i>

39:49.261 --> 39:52.306
is the opportunity to not just make
a beautiful piece of art

39:52.431 --> 39:56.143
but something that represents things
that inspire people to feel like they can

39:56.268 --> 39:59.980
do better and that's exactly
what <i>Black Panther</i> did when it came out,

40:00.314 --> 40:03.442
especially in the time we're in right now
with all the unjust going on.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.194
I appreciate you, Blaque.

40:05.277 --> 40:07.029
-I see you, man, and I appreciate you.
-Thank you.

40:07.279 --> 40:10.408
I see all of you and I thank you guys
for all joining in together

40:10.491 --> 40:12.952
'cause that's what this is about,
this is the world I see.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.579
I see all different beautiful cultures
in this room

40:15.663 --> 40:20.042
and we all recognize each other
and that's what is<i> Foodtastic,</i> man.

40:20.167 --> 40:21.335
You know, seriously.

40:21.460 --> 40:26.674
I just feel so honored to be able
to do this in this competition.

40:26.882 --> 40:30.302
I'm just so excited,
I'm literally... I'm speechless.

40:30.386 --> 40:32.096
-All right, yeah, so there we go.
-Here you go, baby.

40:32.179 --> 40:33.347
All right, so...

40:35.224 --> 40:36.308
So...

40:36.725 --> 40:38.978
-A lot of emotions today.
-Yes, a lot of emotions.

40:39.061 --> 40:41.605
-Beautiful emotions. Beautiful.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Beautiful.

40:42.231 --> 40:45.609
I don't know if there's really
any more words that we all could say.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.736
-Yeah, I mean...
-I think it's very clear.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.530
-It's clear. Totally.
-All right.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.740
RACHELL: What do you think they're saying?

40:51.824 --> 40:54.118
I have no idea. They already know.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.248
Oh, my God!

41:01.167 --> 41:06.422
It has been epic watching you all work
tirelessly to help our Sorceress

41:06.505 --> 41:09.175
<i>and our planet to defeat this invasion.</i>

41:09.592 --> 41:12.887
But only one team made
the difference today.

41:16.932 --> 41:18.893
(ALL CHEER)

41:25.149 --> 41:27.526
This is awesome. This is awesome.

41:28.652 --> 41:33.574
The team that created the most Foodtastic
Avengers action scene is...

41:35.701 --> 41:36.869
What?

41:41.707 --> 41:42.708
Misfits!

41:42.958 --> 41:45.252
(LOUD CHEERING)

41:53.385 --> 41:56.222
To win this competition, I'm elated,
I'm proud of what we did.

41:56.430 --> 41:59.850
Please come and receive
your <i>Foodtastic </i>pins.

42:01.727 --> 42:05.147
BLAQUE: <i>I know my son is gonna be proud.</i>
<i>I know my family is gonna be proud.</i>

42:05.272 --> 42:07.024
I know the community is proud right now.

42:07.316 --> 42:08.567
KEKE: I just gotta tell you guys,

42:08.734 --> 42:12.112
you made Marvel proud,
you made Black Panther proud,

42:12.321 --> 42:14.281
and I'm sure you made Chadwick proud.

42:15.824 --> 42:19.161
This is diversity
and inclusion right here.

42:19.453 --> 42:22.331
<i>This is what Black Panther</i>
<i>and Rocket represents</i>

42:22.414 --> 42:23.582
<i>in our foodscape.</i>

42:23.707 --> 42:27.127
We loved all you guys' foodscapes,
so please come up here and join us.

42:27.253 --> 42:28.462
Yes!

42:29.630 --> 42:32.424
And remember,
never stop playing with your food!

42:34.885 --> 42:37.263
NARRATOR: <i>While the Misfits celebrate</i>
<i>a well-earned victory...</i>

42:37.513 --> 42:38.639
Seriously.

42:38.806 --> 42:41.433
NARRATOR:
<i>Our Sorceress finds herself safe at last.</i>

42:42.560 --> 42:46.105
Thank you. With your help the evil forces
have been defeated.

42:46.313 --> 42:48.816
Banished back into the darkness
right where they belong.

42:48.899 --> 42:51.151
NARRATOR: <i>And thank you for returning</i>
<i>the Infinity Stones.</i>

42:51.360 --> 42:53.445
<i>They have the power to decide</i>
<i>the fate of the universe,</i>

42:53.529 --> 42:55.197
<i>so we need to make sure</i>
<i>they're kept safe.</i>

42:55.281 --> 42:58.534
You got it! I'll return them right
after I go to the dry cleaners but...

42:59.201 --> 43:00.953
I also need to go pick up a prescription.

43:01.203 --> 43:05.040
And I can't forget my mom at my grandma's
because she'll just get so upset.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.418
<i>They can just talk all day.</i>
<i>Sometimes it's like,</i>

43:07.501 --> 43:08.794
<i>"Hey, why do you need me to come?"</i>

43:09.878 --> 43:11.130
NARRATOR: <i>You were really out there.</i>

43:11.755 --> 43:17.845
Yeah. But I had the coolest dream.
(LAUGHS)

43:18.887 --> 43:21.140
(SIGHS) Back to life.

43:21.557 --> 43:24.351
Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here!

43:24.518 --> 43:27.980
We've got the semi-freshest hot dogs
in the city.

43:28.647 --> 43:29.648
C'mon.
