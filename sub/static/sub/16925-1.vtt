WEBVTT

01:08.570 --> 01:10.613
Pay attention!

01:10.780 --> 01:13.533
Ah, yes sir.

01:13.658 --> 01:19.539
Take this map to Kanemaru now

01:19.664 --> 01:22.458
and bring me the promised money.

01:22.584 --> 01:24.711
What is this, sir?

01:25.128 --> 01:27.463
If Kanemaru wants this,
it must be something big.

01:27.630 --> 01:30.008
Watch that mouth of yours!

01:30.300 --> 01:37.807
If word gets out,
bandits will be hounding all over it.

01:38.141 --> 01:41.477
Make sure word doesn't get out.

01:57.827 --> 01:59.579
They're in the independence army, too?

02:00.455 --> 02:03.499
Do you know Park Chang-yi?

02:04.667 --> 02:06.628
He's in on this, too?

02:07.337 --> 02:08.503
Yes.

02:15.762 --> 02:19.932
All you have to do is give this map
to Kanemaru.

02:20.266 --> 02:23.519
Chang-yi will see to the rest.

02:23.978 --> 02:29.150
Kanemaru will be on the train to
North Manchuria with a map.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.988
That map is very important to us.
We need it.

02:35.615 --> 02:37.367
And why should I help you?

02:37.700 --> 02:38.993
'Cuz there's money in it.

02:40.411 --> 02:41.704
It depends on the amount.

02:42.413 --> 02:44.707
What's the reward money
on Park Chang-yi's head?

02:45.833 --> 02:46.876
Will that be enough?

02:50.254 --> 02:51.547
Not bad.

02:51.964 --> 02:55.343
We have no other choice
but to pay you to do this.

02:56.469 --> 02:57.637
So don't screw up.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.097
Yes, sir.

03:03.559 --> 03:04.686
Remember!

03:05.645 --> 03:10.316
You've never set eyes on that map,
understood?

03:11.567 --> 03:13.236
Of course, sir.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.737
Now, go.

03:20.368 --> 03:23.913
Your job is to get on the train.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.417
And steal the map back
from Kanemaru.

03:27.583 --> 03:32.338
We get paid and the map back.
Everyone's happy.

03:33.381 --> 03:36.801
Manchurian soldiers are escorting him.
Be careful.

03:36.926 --> 03:38.428
Are you worried, sir?

03:39.262 --> 03:40.972
Of course not.

03:41.556 --> 03:44.308
I know what you're capable of.

03:44.851 --> 03:47.520
You're the best in all of Manchuria.

03:55.445 --> 03:56.821
Just Manchuria?

03:57.864 --> 04:00.950
Best in Manchuria means best
on the continent.

04:01.784 --> 04:04.954
Forgive me, I'm not good
with words.

04:05.955 --> 04:10.710
Here.
Your train ticket to Gando.

04:11.461 --> 04:12.712
Park Chang-yi...

04:21.971 --> 04:25.224
What the hell are you doing?

04:25.850 --> 04:28.436
Bandits don't need train tickets.

04:29.061 --> 04:30.146
Then?

04:31.355 --> 04:32.523
We'll stop it.

06:14.458 --> 06:15.918
Rice cakes!

06:16.669 --> 06:18.254
Candy!

06:19.589 --> 06:21.257
Rice cakes!

06:23.050 --> 06:24.050
Candy!

06:24.093 --> 06:28.139
Independence for Korea!

06:29.765 --> 06:31.100
Rice cakes!

06:31.851 --> 06:33.311
Candy!

06:34.437 --> 06:36.022
Rice cakes!

06:36.647 --> 06:37.023
Candy!

06:37.148 --> 06:38.441
Over here!

06:41.152 --> 06:42.737
Rice cakes!

07:02.465 --> 07:03.966
Nobody move!

07:09.055 --> 07:10.222
Don't move!

07:10.473 --> 07:17.647
<i>The Good The Bad The Weird</i>

07:30.660 --> 07:31.869
Get up!

07:32.036 --> 07:33.036
All of you!

07:34.455 --> 07:35.581
Hurry UP!

07:35.956 --> 07:37.208
Hurry UP!

07:38.250 --> 07:39.250
NOW!

07:43.255 --> 07:44.507
What's going on?

07:46.175 --> 07:47.426
Who are you?

07:47.551 --> 07:49.011
Can you speak Korean?

07:52.264 --> 07:53.641
Do you understand Korean!

07:54.475 --> 07:55.518
What?

07:56.852 --> 08:00.356
Don't know any Korean, at all?

08:03.150 --> 08:04.777
Bags!

08:04.944 --> 08:06.487
The bags! Hurry!

08:06.654 --> 08:07.863
Get 'em down!

08:09.365 --> 08:10.491
Hurry!

08:13.244 --> 08:14.244
Hey, you!

08:14.537 --> 08:16.539
Get that one down, too!

08:16.664 --> 08:17.664
Quickly!

08:18.040 --> 08:20.543
Get the big bag!

08:36.642 --> 08:37.642
Hurry UP!

08:50.156 --> 08:51.615
Now, the other one!

09:26.567 --> 09:29.320
Hey, is that yours?

09:30.780 --> 09:33.324
Hey! I said, is that yours?

09:34.950 --> 09:35.951
Wait!

09:36.076 --> 09:38.537
Do you know who this is?

09:38.954 --> 09:42.541
He's Sir Kanemaru.
President of Japanese Imperial Bank!

09:43.125 --> 09:45.127
Kanemaru or kangaroo! Come here!

10:30.756 --> 10:31.841
What's that?

11:42.661 --> 11:44.747
Stop! Drop to your knees!

11:48.959 --> 11:51.837
Get him! Get him!

11:57.551 --> 11:58.677
You! Go get him!

12:40.135 --> 12:41.804
Shh! Shh!

12:41.971 --> 12:43.138
Get out!

12:43.263 --> 12:44.932
Get out! Go!

12:46.266 --> 12:47.309
Hurry UP!

12:47.476 --> 12:48.644
Yes, sir!

13:24.680 --> 13:26.640
<i>Find Kanemaru's bag, first!</i>

13:27.182 --> 13:29.018
Get Kanemaru's bag, first!

13:59.882 --> 14:01.216
What the hell?

14:02.176 --> 14:03.218
Bitch!

14:03.385 --> 14:04.928
No!

14:12.561 --> 14:14.063
Is Chang-yi after the map?

15:18.961 --> 15:19.961
Come here!

15:20.337 --> 15:21.588
Shut up!

15:22.131 --> 15:23.131
Shut up!

15:27.636 --> 15:28.804
Come out!

15:29.263 --> 15:30.639
I'll kill you!

15:32.850 --> 15:35.018
Shaoling! No!

15:35.561 --> 15:38.522
Please let her go!

16:10.554 --> 16:11.554
Open up!

16:12.055 --> 16:13.055
Move!

16:18.478 --> 16:19.646
Does it hurt?

17:12.866 --> 17:13.866
Find the map!

17:16.954 --> 17:18.121
Give me the rifle!

18:06.253 --> 18:07.462
Who the hell is that?

18:19.349 --> 18:20.934
Stop the train, now!

19:18.158 --> 19:19.158
Byung-choon?

19:19.868 --> 19:20.911
Yes, sir?

19:22.371 --> 19:24.706
What do you think
is going on over there?

19:29.878 --> 19:31.421
No clue, huh?

19:33.465 --> 19:34.465
No, sir.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.135
I think.

19:38.178 --> 19:41.348
It's the fool up front
who has the map.

19:45.435 --> 19:46.686
Man-gil!

19:49.231 --> 19:51.525
Let's go! Hurry!

20:02.369 --> 20:03.828
<i>Park Chang-yi</i>
The man behind him is
a bounty hunter named Park Do-won.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.550
<i>Yoon Tae-goo</i>
The man behind him is
a bounty hunter named Park Do-won.

20:07.082 --> 20:08.625
What a nuisance!

20:08.750 --> 20:09.835
Get rid of him!

20:10.752 --> 20:11.753
Yes, sir.

20:13.672 --> 20:16.091
- Who was that?
- I don't know!

20:16.258 --> 20:18.927
Isn't the guy on the bike
a friend of yours?

20:19.761 --> 20:22.264
Yes, but not anymore.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.517
- Did 'ya get anything?
- Sure did!

20:25.642 --> 20:26.810
What?

20:27.644 --> 20:29.604
I'll show you later. Let's go!

20:29.771 --> 20:33.942
Alright! Let's go!

20:38.864 --> 20:40.115
Get moving!

20:51.543 --> 20:53.003
What do you think it is?

20:53.753 --> 20:56.506
Well... Not sure.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.383
Where is it?

20:58.967 --> 21:00.927
Maybe Manchuria...

21:02.637 --> 21:06.808
But with the Russian writing,
could be the Maritimes Province.

21:12.272 --> 21:13.440
Wait...

21:16.776 --> 21:17.776
Hey!

21:19.654 --> 21:21.323
This is a treasure map!

21:22.157 --> 21:23.617
A treasure map?

21:28.455 --> 21:29.664
Before Qing Dynasty's fall,

21:29.831 --> 21:33.001
they buried a great treasure
somewhere in Manchuria.

21:33.168 --> 21:34.628
This is the map!

21:35.462 --> 21:36.505
No way!

21:36.838 --> 21:41.843
It came out on the Ghost Market
once then suddenly vanished!

21:42.260 --> 21:45.722
All the bandits came to
the Ghost Market for it.

21:49.184 --> 21:53.355
Go find out everything you can
about that map.

21:53.772 --> 21:54.940
Gotcha.

21:58.860 --> 22:00.362
Leave the map.

22:01.363 --> 22:03.198
What? You don't trust me'?

22:03.657 --> 22:05.825
It ain't that. Leave it and go.

22:05.951 --> 22:07.702
Come on, man.

22:08.370 --> 22:12.415
It's dangerous to be
carrying it around, fool.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.543
And...

22:16.962 --> 22:18.213
Exchange this for money.

22:20.549 --> 22:23.635
Whoa!
They'll be worth quite a bit.

22:23.760 --> 22:27.430
Be careful.
They might've trailed us here already.

22:28.056 --> 22:31.017
No way. They wouldn't dare!

22:31.184 --> 22:33.395
This is my turt!

22:33.562 --> 22:35.522
Just be careful!

22:35.647 --> 22:37.399
Okay, I got it!

22:37.941 --> 22:39.109
Bastard.

23:03.341 --> 23:07.012
What in the world is this?

23:10.348 --> 23:12.017
Russia...

23:13.935 --> 23:15.312
Border...

23:16.563 --> 23:18.023
Treasure...

23:20.650 --> 23:22.944
Absolutely no idea.

24:05.862 --> 24:07.238
Who's there?

24:22.962 --> 24:23.962
Hold on.

24:41.856 --> 24:43.024
What should we do?

24:46.736 --> 24:47.570
Who is it?

24:47.737 --> 24:49.280
It's me, Byung-choon.

24:54.244 --> 24:55.537
Byung-choon?

25:27.652 --> 25:28.111
What the!

25:28.236 --> 25:29.404
You freak!

25:30.864 --> 25:32.615
Get out!

25:32.741 --> 25:36.327
Sorry! Sorry!

25:36.453 --> 25:37.620
Don't move!

25:38.079 --> 25:39.122
Get out!

26:29.130 --> 26:30.298
Shit!

27:25.270 --> 27:30.024
What happened? Tell me!
Where's the map?

27:33.528 --> 27:35.572
Hurry up and give it to me.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.407
Before I do...

27:38.741 --> 27:40.535
You must pay your dues.

27:40.952 --> 27:42.704
Ah, right.

28:11.149 --> 28:13.610
What do you think you're doing?

28:20.158 --> 28:22.035
I should've known. Fine.

28:22.160 --> 28:25.622
I'll give you what you want.
Just give me the map.

28:50.438 --> 28:53.524
Crazy bastard!

28:54.067 --> 28:58.821
You've got some nerve for someone
who's hired to kill!

28:58.947 --> 29:00.448
Gone insane over money!

29:00.949 --> 29:04.452
You worthless son of a bitch.

29:04.577 --> 29:08.247
I took you in when you were
wandering around drunk.

29:08.373 --> 29:10.124
I saved your sorry life!

29:20.969 --> 29:25.431
I wanted to end this nicely,
but now you give me no choice.

29:25.556 --> 29:29.310
No matter how notorious
of a ruthless killer you are,

29:29.477 --> 29:31.312
you can't dodge a bullet.

29:31.854 --> 29:35.316
A bastard who kisses the asses
of traitors...

29:35.483 --> 29:37.819
What a pitiful end you'll...

30:09.684 --> 30:11.019
Funny, ain't it?

30:12.770 --> 30:16.190
People must know
they'll all die someday.

30:17.734 --> 30:20.069
But they live as if they never will.

30:21.654 --> 30:23.614
Damn funny.

30:29.037 --> 30:31.205
Well, well...

31:05.156 --> 31:07.033
You lived long enough.

31:07.742 --> 31:09.243
Selling off your country.

32:47.466 --> 32:48.926
We found out, sir.

32:49.343 --> 32:51.637
It's the Ghost Market thugs
and Park Do-won.

32:51.762 --> 32:53.931
Knowing I, Park Chang-yi,
would be after it?

32:54.056 --> 32:56.350
Yes, sir. But...

32:56.767 --> 32:59.437
Looks like Park Do-won
was after you, sir.

33:08.362 --> 33:09.363
The Ghost Market?

33:09.530 --> 33:11.574
It's a market for stolen goods.

33:19.874 --> 33:23.419
There was a gunfight last night.

33:23.544 --> 33:26.839
The fool who stole the map ran away
to the Ghost Market.

33:27.256 --> 33:29.842
He'll probably sell it there.

33:30.259 --> 33:31.636
How many men can we round up?

33:31.761 --> 33:33.054
About a dozen, sir.

33:35.389 --> 33:37.225
Get the boys and go
to the Ghost Market!

33:39.852 --> 33:40.852
Pack it up.

33:40.937 --> 33:41.937
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

34:27.358 --> 34:31.237
Come in. Cheap prices!

34:36.158 --> 34:38.119
Good lantern, sir?

34:39.161 --> 34:40.746
Come in and look around.

34:51.340 --> 34:52.340
Umbrellas for sale!

34:53.342 --> 34:54.342
Out of my Way!

34:56.053 --> 34:57.053
Umbrellas!

35:29.170 --> 35:30.338
Granny?

35:31.255 --> 35:33.424
You sure do live long.

35:35.259 --> 35:37.845
You'll probably outlive me.

35:39.555 --> 35:41.223
What happened last night?

35:42.767 --> 35:44.643
Byung-choon came after me.

35:44.852 --> 35:47.229
The idiot even said his name
before shooting.

35:47.355 --> 35:49.148
Why? For the map?

35:49.523 --> 35:50.900
Probably.

35:51.025 --> 35:52.526
So did you find out anything?

35:52.651 --> 35:55.780
It's gotta be
the Qing Dynasty treasure map.

35:56.447 --> 36:01.327
Not only the bandits
but the Japanese army's after it.

36:03.662 --> 36:04.662
Let me see it.

36:13.881 --> 36:16.425
There's gotta be somethin'...

36:23.057 --> 36:23.891
Forget it! Give it back.

36:24.058 --> 36:26.394
Hold on! I know this!

36:27.144 --> 36:32.691
This is the Russian Empire...

36:33.067 --> 36:34.318
Alexand...

36:34.443 --> 36:35.903
Sand? Desert?

36:36.070 --> 36:37.530
Alexander.

36:38.948 --> 36:41.742
What's that?

36:41.867 --> 36:44.537
- Give it to me!
- I know what I'm doing!

36:46.247 --> 36:47.331
Next word is...

36:49.458 --> 36:50.543
'Buried'.

36:51.252 --> 36:52.753
It says, 'Buried'!

36:54.380 --> 36:55.631
Like a buried treasure?

36:55.756 --> 36:57.007
That's right!

36:57.258 --> 36:58.509
Then it says...

36:58.634 --> 36:59.634
'Excavation'!

36:59.760 --> 37:01.262
Ex-vacation? What's that?

37:01.429 --> 37:02.471
It means dig up.

37:02.638 --> 37:04.014
Then...

37:04.432 --> 37:06.725
'In large... volumes'?

37:08.269 --> 37:13.607
Then this all means, buried, dig up,
in large volumes?

37:15.860 --> 37:16.860
Hold on!

37:17.361 --> 37:18.821
- Are you sellin' it?
- Nope.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.322
You crazy?

37:20.656 --> 37:24.743
The Ghost Market thugs are after this.
The word will get out quick.

37:24.869 --> 37:29.290
The chief here will probably give 'ya
at least 1000 won.

37:29.457 --> 37:30.708
You idiot!

37:30.833 --> 37:34.503
This could be worth millions!

37:34.628 --> 37:36.297
Are you out of your mind?

37:36.464 --> 37:37.965
The reward on your head
is 300 won.

37:38.132 --> 37:39.300
What?

37:39.633 --> 37:41.302
I'm only worth a piano?

37:41.469 --> 37:42.469
A used one at that.

37:43.345 --> 37:45.931
They think I'm just a petty thief?

37:46.056 --> 37:49.310
You, Mr. Train Robber,
ARE a petty thief.

37:49.477 --> 37:54.648
Let's just sell it at the
Ghost Market for 1000 won.

37:54.773 --> 37:58.444
Forget it. I'm gonna see
if this is worth gold or shit.

37:59.361 --> 38:01.322
Granny! Granny!

38:01.489 --> 38:04.200
Know what this is?

38:04.533 --> 38:06.535
It's a treasure map!

38:06.660 --> 38:10.289
If we find the treasure,
it's goodbye to this for us.

38:10.456 --> 38:15.002
We'll eat all we want
and live in luxury!

38:15.169 --> 38:18.130
Where do you wanna go? America?

38:19.173 --> 38:21.008
Where else? France?

38:21.175 --> 38:23.928
En toi, c'est dah Di dah.
Je t'aime, moi non plus?

38:30.476 --> 38:31.476
What?

38:32.478 --> 38:33.854
Damn! Shit!

38:38.359 --> 38:39.860
Shit! I told 'ya they're fast!

38:40.027 --> 38:41.028
Where are they?

38:42.530 --> 38:43.697
Out the window?

38:59.046 --> 39:00.631
Get out! Hurry!

39:00.756 --> 39:03.926
Get Granny!

39:04.468 --> 39:05.719
Granny! Granny!

39:36.667 --> 39:37.751
Those bastards!

39:39.962 --> 39:40.629
Run!

39:40.754 --> 39:41.755
Bastard!

39:43.924 --> 39:45.426
Granny!

39:46.552 --> 39:47.678
It's not safe here.

39:56.270 --> 39:57.438
They went that way!

40:02.568 --> 40:04.737
Stay right here.

40:04.862 --> 40:08.616
Don't lose this
and don't show it to anyone.

40:10.451 --> 40:16.206
Even if Man-gil asks,
tell him you never saw the map.

40:17.541 --> 40:18.292
Damn!

40:18.459 --> 40:19.710
Watch Granny!

40:44.777 --> 40:46.820
Hey! Move!

41:01.460 --> 41:03.260
- The Ghost Market Gang is coming!
- Get back!

41:12.554 --> 41:13.722
Damn sons of bitches!

42:33.844 --> 42:37.097
Yoon Tae-goo, age 35,
300 won reward.

42:38.140 --> 42:39.266
What are you saying?

42:39.850 --> 42:41.518
I don't speak Korean.

42:41.852 --> 42:43.604
You're Chinese, are 'ya?

42:44.771 --> 42:47.232
No! Please! Stop!

42:48.275 --> 42:49.318
I knew it was you.

42:55.157 --> 42:56.617
You have the map, don't you?

43:04.458 --> 43:05.626
Who are you?

43:05.834 --> 43:09.379
Yes or no.
Just answer the question.

43:09.546 --> 43:14.635
You're after the map, too?

43:14.968 --> 43:17.137
Damn bastards.

43:18.847 --> 43:21.016
I did, but not now. So there!

43:21.642 --> 43:22.643
Where is it?

43:24.269 --> 43:27.731
Use your brain, fool.

43:27.856 --> 43:31.527
I'm in this shit 'cuz of that map.

43:32.277 --> 43:34.321
You think I'd just go and tell 'ya?

43:35.656 --> 43:37.908
The independence army wants it,
not me.

43:39.451 --> 43:41.495
Independence army, my ass.

43:41.662 --> 43:42.663
Think I'd fall for that?

43:44.957 --> 43:47.209
Talking doesn't get through
to 'ya, does it!

43:47.334 --> 43:49.836
Wait!

43:50.963 --> 43:53.632
Okay! Okay!

43:54.967 --> 43:56.718
I've got an offer for 'ya.

43:57.678 --> 43:59.721
I don't make deals with scoundrels.

44:01.265 --> 44:05.936
I'll tell you a big secret
about that map.

44:06.270 --> 44:07.437
You know what it says?

44:11.358 --> 44:14.820
'Treasure, Buried,
Dig up, Large volumes'.

44:15.362 --> 44:16.113
What?

44:16.196 --> 44:18.073
That's what it says on it!

44:22.035 --> 44:24.371
It's a treasure map!

44:26.915 --> 44:29.793
So you and me can go find it!

44:29.918 --> 44:33.589
If there's a treasure,
we split it 60-40.

44:33.714 --> 44:35.215
Me 60, you 40.

44:39.219 --> 44:40.387
How 'bout it?

44:41.346 --> 44:43.682
That's how you make a deal, man!

44:48.228 --> 44:53.525
Did 'ya say your name was
Park Do-won?

44:53.650 --> 44:56.737
You must've heard of who I am.

44:56.862 --> 44:58.405
Of course you did.

44:58.572 --> 45:02.618
Then do you know the Ghost Market?
My boys there will...

45:05.245 --> 45:06.413
- Hey!
- Sorry.

45:06.580 --> 45:08.248
You crazy bastard!

45:08.373 --> 45:11.918
You evil son of a bitch!

45:12.085 --> 45:16.006
I've never seen a Korean
so mean and vicious!

45:17.132 --> 45:19.092
You can't do this to me, man!

45:19.259 --> 45:20.469
How old are 'ya!

45:20.636 --> 45:21.636
You little...

45:47.579 --> 45:48.747
Hey, Yoon Tae-goo.

45:49.831 --> 45:52.125
Don't even think about escaping.

45:52.626 --> 45:53.960
Give me some water.

45:54.336 --> 45:57.381
What did you catch this time?

45:59.341 --> 46:00.634
What's this?

46:01.551 --> 46:04.930
Get some sleep.
You got a rough day ahead.

46:08.475 --> 46:10.727
Get me some water, girlie.

46:10.852 --> 46:12.813
It can talk?

46:18.068 --> 46:19.653
Water, please.

46:28.328 --> 46:30.497
<i>- Song-yi!</i>
- Coming!

46:34.668 --> 46:36.420
But...

48:33.161 --> 48:34.621
Going somewhere?

48:37.332 --> 48:38.500
Escaping?

48:40.335 --> 48:42.879
No, of course not.

48:44.464 --> 48:48.301
I just gave it a tug
and it just fell out.

48:50.470 --> 48:52.430
You folks
shouldn't be so careless.

48:53.849 --> 48:55.517
Fine. Go back in and sleep.

48:59.980 --> 49:04.818
Hey, it's raining!

49:26.756 --> 49:27.841
Boss?

49:37.767 --> 49:39.019
We saw Yoon Tae-goo, today.

49:39.185 --> 49:43.398
He's the one who took the map.

51:02.769 --> 51:04.604
Just as you wanted.

51:11.152 --> 51:13.238
Everyone's happy, huh?

51:13.363 --> 51:16.825
I get money. You get the map.

51:16.950 --> 51:19.119
And the original's safe where it is.

51:21.579 --> 51:24.916
If this map is wrong...

51:25.041 --> 51:27.711
or there's no treasure,

51:28.253 --> 51:29.879
then I'll find you.

51:31.256 --> 51:34.676
And make sure you get buried alive.

51:36.970 --> 51:39.514
That's no way
to talk to an old pal.

52:00.952 --> 52:02.996
Look at what they did to my place.

52:03.163 --> 52:05.498
Man-gil, that idiot.
Where the hell is Man-gil, the fool.

52:05.665 --> 52:06.665
Granny!

52:06.958 --> 52:08.126
Granny?

52:28.980 --> 52:30.106
Granny!

52:32.233 --> 52:33.359
Granny!

52:34.152 --> 52:34.986
Granny!

52:35.153 --> 52:36.529
Damn! You scared me!

52:37.739 --> 52:40.784
You slept in here all this time?

52:40.950 --> 52:43.328
Damn Man-gil!
Told him to watch Granny...

52:43.453 --> 52:46.206
Where's the map, Granny?

52:46.372 --> 52:48.124
Where'd you put it?

52:48.458 --> 52:49.918
Where is it?

52:52.170 --> 52:54.130
No, not candy!

52:54.255 --> 52:56.549
The big map I gave you.

52:56.674 --> 52:57.717
The map!

52:57.884 --> 52:59.052
Just once.

52:59.677 --> 53:02.555
Once? Did someone take it?

53:02.680 --> 53:04.390
Who did you give it to?

53:05.975 --> 53:07.811
Let go. Man-gil?

53:08.144 --> 53:09.896
Did he take the map?

53:19.572 --> 53:20.907
I had to come and see you.

53:22.742 --> 53:23.910
Do I know you?

53:25.078 --> 53:26.329
You're alone?

53:27.747 --> 53:30.333
Yoon Tae-goo's a friend
of yours, right?

53:30.750 --> 53:31.918
Where is he?

53:33.753 --> 53:35.922
And who might you be?

53:37.924 --> 53:40.093
I'm Park Chang-yi.

53:42.053 --> 53:43.429
Park Chang-yi?

54:13.459 --> 54:14.669
You bastard!

54:59.964 --> 55:01.341
Help me!

55:12.852 --> 55:14.520
Tae-goo...

55:16.648 --> 55:18.316
Tae-goo...

55:21.236 --> 55:24.364
Hey!
Where do you think you're going?

55:33.039 --> 55:35.333
- Give me another knife!
- Yes, sir.

55:37.377 --> 55:41.923
I have a message.

55:42.674 --> 55:44.717
A message for Tae-goo.

55:54.435 --> 55:56.896
So stay calm.

55:58.147 --> 56:00.275
And listen up.

56:02.360 --> 56:04.237
Tae-goo!

56:04.946 --> 56:06.114
Got it?

56:21.754 --> 56:24.590
This blade's blunt! Sharpen it!

56:24.757 --> 56:26.217
Hurry UP!

56:28.052 --> 56:29.429
Damn rain...

56:31.139 --> 56:32.432
What! Run!

56:34.934 --> 56:35.935
Retreat! Retreat!

56:47.280 --> 56:48.448
This way!

56:54.662 --> 56:55.662
Man-gil!

56:55.955 --> 56:58.708
Man-gil!

57:04.255 --> 57:06.924
Stay right here, okay?

57:22.774 --> 57:24.025
Shit!

57:27.278 --> 57:30.615
You! Run to the other side.

57:30.740 --> 57:32.408
So I can see
where they're shooting from.

57:35.453 --> 57:37.580
Why should I be the one?

57:38.664 --> 57:40.124
Then who else?

57:51.844 --> 57:55.640
Should I run straight on?

57:55.765 --> 57:59.435
Or zigzag around
and make 'em confused?

58:02.730 --> 58:04.190
Fine. I'll decide.

58:29.257 --> 58:31.134
Hey! Come here!

58:32.176 --> 58:33.176
Follow me!

58:47.233 --> 58:49.527
Give me a gun, man!

58:51.654 --> 58:52.654
Hey!

58:53.948 --> 58:55.616
Give me my gun back!

59:15.553 --> 59:17.680
Do-won! Where're 'ya going?

59:20.850 --> 59:22.935
Come back!

59:23.060 --> 59:25.605
Give me my gun!

59:25.771 --> 59:27.940
Where are you going?

59:28.357 --> 59:31.444
Come on! Give me my gun!

59:53.341 --> 59:56.219
Gun! Now! Do-won!

59:57.970 --> 59:59.138
Gun...

01:00:03.476 --> 01:00:04.476
Shit...

01:00:46.561 --> 01:00:49.146
Man-gil! Man-gil!

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:51.023
Man-gil!

01:00:56.028 --> 01:00:57.029
<i>Man-gil!</i>

01:00:59.448 --> 01:01:00.575
Man-gil!

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.328
<i>Man-gil!</i>

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:25.391
Over here!

01:01:43.659 --> 01:01:44.827
Watch out!

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:10.079
Watch out!

01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:13.124
What the!

01:03:17.336 --> 01:03:18.713
- Cover me!
- Get back!

01:03:35.271 --> 01:03:37.314
Get the horses!

01:04:09.847 --> 01:04:11.015
Are you Korean?

01:04:11.223 --> 01:04:12.516
Yes.

01:04:15.936 --> 01:04:17.313
Is Yoon Tae-goo in your gang?

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:22.526
You think we'd mix
with a schmuck like him?

01:04:24.445 --> 01:04:25.738
Damn! That way!

01:04:27.656 --> 01:04:31.535
When our gang gets here,
you're all dead!

01:05:08.948 --> 01:05:10.449
Yoon Tae-goo.

01:05:12.076 --> 01:05:13.452
Park Chang-yi.

01:05:15.287 --> 01:05:16.413
So we meet, here.

01:05:29.552 --> 01:05:33.305
This is awesome
but why's it so damn heavy?

01:05:34.473 --> 01:05:35.724
I'll take this.

01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:38.435
Where the hell is Man-gil, anyway?

01:05:44.984 --> 01:05:46.151
Got any more?

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.078
Are they Chang-yi's gang?

01:05:56.245 --> 01:05:58.372
Damn, they're nasty.

01:06:02.668 --> 01:06:04.503
Why's it so quiet?

01:06:05.045 --> 01:06:06.213
Are they planning somethin'?

01:06:26.233 --> 01:06:27.233
Get on! Hurry!

01:06:29.445 --> 01:06:30.988
Go, Boss! Run!

01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:36.911
The Ghost Market Gang is coming!

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.128
Man-gil!

01:06:49.173 --> 01:06:50.341
Man-gil!

01:06:52.259 --> 01:06:53.552
Man-gil!

01:06:57.848 --> 01:06:59.016
Man-gil!

01:07:01.852 --> 01:07:05.105
Man-gil! Man-gil!

01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:07.399
Tae-goo...

01:07:08.359 --> 01:07:11.111
Park Chang-yi came for you.

01:07:11.445 --> 01:07:13.906
Chang-yi? Why?

01:07:16.867 --> 01:07:18.827
You didn't lose the map, did you?

01:07:44.645 --> 01:07:47.106
How's the meal, boss?

01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:04.623
There's something I was always
curious about.

01:08:07.126 --> 01:08:11.797
I heard you once had a duel
with Yoon Tae-goo, boss.

01:08:13.257 --> 01:08:14.717
Is it true?

01:08:20.639 --> 01:08:22.808
Then who won, sir?

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:27.020
I heard many different versions.

01:08:30.274 --> 01:08:33.152
Some say Tae-goo is the best.

01:09:00.554 --> 01:09:01.554
Get up.

01:09:02.264 --> 01:09:03.264
Sir?

01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:05.517
I'll show you who's the best.
Get up.

01:09:09.438 --> 01:09:10.689
That's not what I meant...

01:09:10.856 --> 01:09:13.024
Get up if you don't want
your head blown off.

01:09:58.445 --> 01:09:59.738
<i>Listen up.</i>

01:10:00.948 --> 01:10:05.536
<i>You'll all witness who's the best</i>

01:10:06.245 --> 01:10:08.914
<i>And who's the legend, real soon.</i>

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:13.919
<i>Don't die till then,
and be sure to watch.</i>

01:10:49.538 --> 01:10:52.791
Hey, let me ask you something.

01:10:54.626 --> 01:10:57.296
Just when I'm about to sleep?

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:00.507
It just popped into head, man.

01:11:01.049 --> 01:11:03.635
Why are you so bent on
catching Chang-yi?

01:11:04.636 --> 01:11:06.805
Ever heard of the Finger Chopper?

01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:08.807
The Finger Chopper?

01:11:10.142 --> 01:11:11.518
Chang-yi's the Finger Chopper?

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.228
Yup.

01:11:15.063 --> 01:11:19.318
I heard he came to Manchuria
but no one's ever seen him.

01:11:19.651 --> 01:11:21.320
It's Chang-yi, for sure.

01:11:23.822 --> 01:11:28.118
There was a guy in Wonsan who claimed
he was the Finger Chopper.

01:11:29.745 --> 01:11:32.289
When Chang-yi heard about him...

01:11:33.248 --> 01:11:36.210
he found him and butchered him.

01:11:37.044 --> 01:11:40.339
<i>Just 'cuz he claimed
to be the Finger Chopper.</i>

01:11:42.257 --> 01:11:45.010
<i>He shot him and cut him up
like a piece of meat.</i>

01:11:47.763 --> 01:11:49.932
Along with five of his men.

01:11:52.893 --> 01:11:54.895
<i>Even cut off his finger, too.</i>

01:11:57.522 --> 01:12:00.692
If you weren't in the way,
I could've gotten him.

01:12:07.241 --> 01:12:08.408
What's so funny?

01:12:14.039 --> 01:12:16.333
The rumors.

01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:21.630
You say Chang-yi's the Finger Chopper
but it's different from what I know.

01:12:22.965 --> 01:12:26.718
So you're after him
'cuz he's the Finger Chopper?

01:12:26.885 --> 01:12:28.428
'Cuz he is bad.

01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:30.514
That's it?

01:12:31.056 --> 01:12:32.516
And for the money.

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:35.352
You scare me more than him, man.

01:12:37.062 --> 01:12:39.189
If you have no country,
you still gotta have money.

01:12:41.066 --> 01:12:45.821
You're the most cold-hearted Korean
I've ever met.

01:12:45.946 --> 01:12:47.739
You'll end up rich for sure.

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:51.410
The map and Chang-yi's head
will get me 6000 won.

01:12:52.369 --> 01:12:54.830
I'll hand over the map
as soon as I get Chang-yi.

01:12:55.163 --> 01:12:57.249
Just hope he takes the bait soon.

01:12:57.666 --> 01:13:01.128
If this really is a treasure map,
he's sure to follow you.

01:13:01.586 --> 01:13:03.088
Even if it's to hell.

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:08.051
Hey, wait a minute.

01:13:08.552 --> 01:13:11.680
This map ain't his!

01:13:12.264 --> 01:13:14.516
He's after me 'cuz I stole a map
he wanted first?

01:13:14.641 --> 01:13:17.019
It ain't right!

01:13:17.436 --> 01:13:19.438
Thieves got rules?

01:13:19.563 --> 01:13:21.315
You don't know, man.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.318
Thieves have rules, too.

01:13:24.443 --> 01:13:29.948
If someone's in the door before 'ya,
you back off.

01:13:30.073 --> 01:13:33.535
Chang-yi's goin' against the rules!

01:13:33.785 --> 01:13:36.121
Pisses me off...

01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:41.418
Hey, wait!

01:13:41.543 --> 01:13:45.297
If he's still following us
after getting beat at the market,

01:13:45.464 --> 01:13:48.216
That means this is
a real treasure map!

01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:52.137
Yes! That's right!

01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:53.722
Keep following me,
Park Chang-yi!

01:13:53.764 --> 01:13:55.432
What's so funny?

01:13:55.849 --> 01:13:57.934
I'm happy, man!

01:14:02.356 --> 01:14:05.942
I'll tell 'ya since we're
in this together.

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:11.323
If we find a big treasure there,
whatever it may be,

01:14:11.448 --> 01:14:15.494
You know what I'll do with it?
Wanna hear what my dream is?

01:14:18.789 --> 01:14:22.459
I'm going back home
and buying me some land.

01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:29.925
I'll build a house, raise some cows,
horses, and sheep.

01:14:33.345 --> 01:14:34.513
That's it?

01:14:36.348 --> 01:14:39.226
And some dogs and chickens, too.

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:43.188
Anything else besides buying land
and raising livestock?

01:14:45.232 --> 01:14:47.192
I never thought beyond that.

01:14:48.652 --> 01:14:50.862
Why buy land
when your country's stolen?

01:14:52.948 --> 01:14:55.200
For folks like us,

01:14:55.367 --> 01:14:58.787
it's the same
living under nobility or the Japs.

01:14:59.371 --> 01:15:00.831
Now, it's your turn.

01:15:01.665 --> 01:15:02.833
For what?

01:15:03.542 --> 01:15:06.336
If we find the treasure,
what do you want'?

01:15:06.962 --> 01:15:10.048
Wait, I shouldn't be chattin' away
like this.

01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:12.342
Let's sleep.
We got a big day ahead.

01:15:17.347 --> 01:15:19.224
How did you end up in Manchuria?

01:15:20.142 --> 01:15:22.227
I came to live a new life.

01:15:22.352 --> 01:15:24.062
Why Manchuria of all places?

01:15:25.564 --> 01:15:27.899
Did you steal in Korea, too?

01:15:29.359 --> 01:15:31.611
Don't ask, man. It's sad.

01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:37.242
Every Korean has a sad story.

01:15:40.579 --> 01:15:42.414
Hey. Yoon Tae-goo.

01:15:45.167 --> 01:15:48.753
Everyone has the right
to dream big but...

01:15:51.548 --> 01:15:52.924
Did you know?

01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:54.217
What?

01:15:54.342 --> 01:15:56.386
Hurry up. I gotta sleep.

01:15:59.848 --> 01:16:04.603
If you chase somethin'
to get somethin'

01:16:04.769 --> 01:16:07.439
Somethin' else will come chasing you.

01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:12.027
Life is about chasing
and being chased.

01:16:13.153 --> 01:16:14.613
There is no escape.

01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:17.532
Let me sleep, man.
Stop making me think!

01:16:26.833 --> 01:16:28.210
This map...

01:16:29.836 --> 01:16:31.963
I don't believe in it.

01:16:34.966 --> 01:16:41.431
But if it's for real
and someone asks what my dream is...

01:16:44.476 --> 01:16:46.019
I'd say...

01:16:50.649 --> 01:16:51.942
You asleep?

01:18:21.865 --> 01:18:22.865
Are we there yet?

01:18:26.953 --> 01:18:31.041
Beyond this hill is a plain.

01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:36.087
Then a small hill
in the middle of the plain.

01:18:37.047 --> 01:18:40.300
Beyond that within a 30m radius
should be the marked place.

01:18:41.259 --> 01:18:42.510
Go and check.

01:18:42.677 --> 01:18:43.677
Yes, sir.

01:18:44.137 --> 01:18:45.388
Hejun! Shengying!

01:18:53.855 --> 01:18:55.315
We finally made it!

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.108
We're here!

01:18:59.277 --> 01:19:01.237
I see it!

01:19:02.447 --> 01:19:04.449
I see it!

01:19:07.452 --> 01:19:10.497
I see the ocean!

01:19:12.832 --> 01:19:14.709
The ocean?

01:19:16.628 --> 01:19:18.004
It's the ocean.

01:19:21.758 --> 01:19:22.634
The ocean?

01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:23.927
What the hell!

01:19:27.972 --> 01:19:29.224
Byung-choon.

01:19:29.849 --> 01:19:31.518
What happened?

01:19:33.144 --> 01:19:35.438
Damn that Man-gil!

01:20:16.438 --> 01:20:18.022
Food and drinks, please.

01:20:18.523 --> 01:20:19.816
Got a spare room?

01:20:19.941 --> 01:20:21.609
Yes, right down this way.

01:20:21.735 --> 01:20:22.777
Sir.

01:20:28.032 --> 01:20:33.830
This used to be called
a stable house.

01:20:35.165 --> 01:20:40.712
Where people stay and rest
with their horses.

01:20:41.671 --> 01:20:43.423
But now...

01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:52.390
What is this place?

01:20:53.933 --> 01:20:55.894
Don't worry, sir.

01:20:56.936 --> 01:20:57.812
Who are you?

01:20:57.937 --> 01:21:02.817
You don't know me,
but I know you well, sir.

01:21:03.568 --> 01:21:05.528
You robbed that train, didn't you?

01:21:13.453 --> 01:21:15.121
Don't get excited, sir.

01:21:15.747 --> 01:21:19.125
I'm Suh, a fighter for
the independence of Korea.

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:21.628
Crazy from too much opium?

01:21:21.753 --> 01:21:25.590
Even opium dealers are now
into the independence movement?

01:21:25.757 --> 01:21:28.009
Let's discuss the details
in the private room.

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.266
What's going on?

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.318
They're just the barmaids.
Don't worry, sir.

01:22:01.334 --> 01:22:05.588
Embarrassed to say,
but opium funds the movement.

01:22:05.839 --> 01:22:09.884
Our primary customers are
Chinese, Russian, and Japanese.

01:22:10.134 --> 01:22:14.222
You must know how difficult
the situation is in Korea.

01:22:14.347 --> 01:22:15.807
If you'll allow me...

01:22:16.057 --> 01:22:17.517
Anna. My staff.

01:22:17.642 --> 01:22:19.310
As you know,

01:22:19.477 --> 01:22:25.024
The Japanese took over Korea
Manchuria as their puppet.

01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:28.444
And now they're set on
taking Gando.

01:22:29.279 --> 01:22:32.615
But Gando originally belonged to us!

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.492
This land is rightfully ours.

01:22:34.659 --> 01:22:37.495
We owned out to here
in the past.

01:22:37.662 --> 01:22:40.623
Whatever, Mr. Independence.

01:22:40.748 --> 01:22:44.335
My map's got nothing to do with that.

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:46.004
So forget it.

01:22:49.173 --> 01:22:51.217
Not in the face, girl.

01:22:55.972 --> 01:23:01.436
Your map is the key to the future
of Russia and Manchuria.

01:23:01.561 --> 01:23:07.525
If it succeeds,
it'll have a huge impact on...

01:23:17.243 --> 01:23:19.037
Hey, you!

01:23:19.162 --> 01:23:22.832
What the heck are you
talking about?

01:23:22.957 --> 01:23:25.209
You're not making any sense.

01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:29.547
Stop smoking!
He's already giving me a headache!

01:23:31.966 --> 01:23:35.720
The future of Korea,
rests on that map, sir.

01:23:36.054 --> 01:23:43.019
Japan is trying to take over
the inland continent as we speak!

01:23:43.144 --> 01:23:44.520
More than ever

01:23:46.648 --> 01:23:53.821
your map will be
a great help to Korea.

01:23:54.447 --> 01:23:56.032
So, I ask you...

01:23:57.158 --> 01:24:00.036
Who are we?

01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:02.246
What are we?

01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:12.298
<i>If you hand over the map,
you'll be greatly rewarded.</i>

01:24:15.635 --> 01:24:16.678
I get it!

01:24:19.138 --> 01:24:22.100
Mr. Independence wants the map!

01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:25.937
<i>You won't find anything
even if you get there.</i>

01:24:26.062 --> 01:24:31.526
Oh! Mr. Independence really wants
the map, huh?

01:24:38.574 --> 01:24:39.574
Wait!

01:24:42.829 --> 01:24:44.622
Didn't I already say that?

01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:47.417
I said it twice, right?

01:24:48.334 --> 01:24:49.794
I did, didn't I?

01:24:50.128 --> 01:24:51.504
Right girls?

01:24:52.964 --> 01:24:57.510
Stop smoking.
Tell 'em to stop, man.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:02.223
Girls, I can't think
with all this smoke!

01:25:23.828 --> 01:25:28.124
Damn! He's so heavy.

01:25:28.249 --> 01:25:29.417
It's me.

01:25:29.834 --> 01:25:35.423
I got the map so tell Capt. Ishihara
to get the money ready.

01:25:35.548 --> 01:25:38.009
Of course I caught him!

01:25:38.176 --> 01:25:41.512
I told you he'd come this way.

01:25:41.679 --> 01:25:43.514
It's the border.

01:25:44.265 --> 01:25:46.225
<i>Wake up, mister.</i>

01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:48.519
<i>Please, wake up!</i>

01:25:52.023 --> 01:25:53.191
Mister?

01:26:24.055 --> 01:26:25.598
Who are you?

01:26:26.849 --> 01:26:28.226
You a new girl?

01:26:28.351 --> 01:26:29.977
Where's the scumbag?

01:26:30.144 --> 01:26:33.022
New, my ass!
Here I am, shithead!

01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:54.335
Close your eyes, kids!

01:27:12.937 --> 01:27:16.023
Independence fighter my ass!

01:27:16.774 --> 01:27:19.944
He fell for it good!

01:27:30.746 --> 01:27:32.290
Out of the way, kids!

01:28:01.485 --> 01:28:03.613
I'll take the map.

01:28:03.738 --> 01:28:06.115
You can go to hell!

01:28:16.459 --> 01:28:17.501
What?

01:28:20.046 --> 01:28:21.339
You little...

01:28:23.174 --> 01:28:24.717
Close your eyes, kids!

01:28:34.977 --> 01:28:37.104
I've been in countless wars.

01:28:38.147 --> 01:28:40.316
But I've never seen
such gruesome deaths.

01:28:41.442 --> 01:28:43.069
Damn Koreans.

01:28:44.236 --> 01:28:46.530
Perhaps he's a pervert?

01:28:47.031 --> 01:28:49.825
Did you find the map?

01:28:49.951 --> 01:28:52.411
No, sir. We lost it again.

01:28:52.662 --> 01:28:54.538
I hear you're looking for the map.

01:28:54.956 --> 01:28:56.123
No...

01:28:57.041 --> 01:28:59.335
The one who has the map.

01:29:02.254 --> 01:29:03.547
Yoon...

01:29:03.673 --> 01:29:04.924
Tae...

01:29:05.049 --> 01:29:06.050
Goo.

01:29:06.384 --> 01:29:07.635
<i>Capt. Ishihara!</i>

01:29:07.969 --> 01:29:09.804
It's time to make a decision!

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:12.515
Send all the troops.

01:29:13.057 --> 01:29:19.605
<i>Mobilize all forces out there both
Japanese and Manchurian.</i>

01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:22.525
Yes, sir.

01:29:22.858 --> 01:29:25.236
It's not just some secret facility.

01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:28.906
It's Japan's last source of funds
to finance the war.

01:29:29.657 --> 01:29:31.325
So the rumor was true.

01:29:31.742 --> 01:29:35.830
We must destroy it before
the Japanese get to it.

01:29:35.955 --> 01:29:39.750
Wait, Na-yun!
We can't rush into something like this!

01:29:40.251 --> 01:29:43.796
General! Make you decision, sir!

01:29:43.921 --> 01:29:46.298
There's no victory without bloodshed!

01:29:46.424 --> 01:29:49.719
We don't have the forces
to take 'em on, now!

01:29:50.052 --> 01:29:51.929
Give us the command, sir!

01:29:55.266 --> 01:29:56.767
<i>If you don't hurry,</i>

01:29:56.934 --> 01:30:02.106
<i>Tae-goo and Do-won
will get there first.</i>

01:30:02.273 --> 01:30:05.735
I don't know what your deal
is with Tae-goo,

01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:07.945
But stay away from him.

01:30:08.362 --> 01:30:11.115
Never saw anyone come out
alive against him.

01:30:11.574 --> 01:30:14.035
He'll survive no matter what.

01:30:23.627 --> 01:30:24.627
Hey!

01:30:26.547 --> 01:30:28.591
Your damn mouth is
always the problem.

01:30:29.633 --> 01:30:30.633
Hold still!

01:30:44.774 --> 01:30:49.153
<i>What if an independence fighter
took the map?</i>

01:30:52.656 --> 01:30:58.329
<i>If that's the case,
it could mean disaster for us.</i>

01:31:14.261 --> 01:31:15.638
Where's Do-won?

01:31:16.347 --> 01:31:19.433
How would I know?
Just 'cuz I work in a dump like this...

01:31:19.558 --> 01:31:22.019
This is an urgent matter!

01:31:23.437 --> 01:31:26.524
<i>They're headed for the Korean shelter
on the great plain, now!</i>

01:31:26.649 --> 01:31:28.526
<i>The Japanese troops are
headed there, too!</i>

01:31:28.651 --> 01:31:29.693
<i>Hurry! Go!</i>

01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:41.765
Who the hell are they?

01:32:42.850 --> 01:32:43.893
Byung-choon?

01:32:50.941 --> 01:32:53.444
Mom... Mom...

01:32:54.862 --> 01:32:55.862
That way!

01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:57.780
Fire!

01:32:58.365 --> 01:33:05.706
<i>It's the last resource for
our nation's prosperous future.</i>

01:33:06.123 --> 01:33:07.123
<i>Capt. Ishihara!</i>

01:33:07.833 --> 01:33:11.003
<i>We must find that map!</i>

01:33:11.837 --> 01:33:12.963
Byung-choon?

01:33:13.464 --> 01:33:15.090
What's going on here?

01:33:16.759 --> 01:33:18.510
Isn't that the fool
who has the map?

01:33:19.261 --> 01:33:20.638
I think so, sir.

01:33:22.973 --> 01:33:26.310
Blow the horn! Tell the others
to get the fool on the scooter!

01:33:26.477 --> 01:33:27.811
Yes, sir.

01:33:33.067 --> 01:33:36.195
By the way, sir.

01:33:37.238 --> 01:33:40.115
What really is this map we're after?

01:34:30.457 --> 01:34:32.334
Yoon Tae-goo!

01:34:34.378 --> 01:34:35.629
Hey, Tae-goo!

01:34:35.754 --> 01:34:39.049
Stop! Or I'll shoot!

01:35:33.645 --> 01:35:34.645
Who do we go after, sir?

01:35:40.861 --> 01:35:41.901
He's the one with the map!

01:35:42.279 --> 01:35:44.031
The one up front!

01:35:44.156 --> 01:35:45.616
Get him!

01:35:45.783 --> 01:35:46.783
Yes, sir!

01:35:47.451 --> 01:35:49.495
All forces! Charge!

01:36:26.532 --> 01:36:27.991
Don't kill him!

01:36:28.742 --> 01:36:31.203
He may not have the map!

01:36:31.328 --> 01:36:34.206
Tell the boys up front!

01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:36.834
Catch him alive!

01:36:36.959 --> 01:36:38.210
Blow the horn!

01:36:44.341 --> 01:36:45.717
Who the hell is that?

01:37:08.365 --> 01:37:10.033
Get him alive!

01:37:38.562 --> 01:37:40.564
The Japanese army is here!

01:38:16.141 --> 01:38:17.434
Should we open fire, sir?

01:38:18.143 --> 01:38:19.603
Hurry up! Fire!

01:38:19.770 --> 01:38:21.605
Wipe 'em all out!

01:38:21.772 --> 01:38:22.772
Yes, sir!

01:38:23.148 --> 01:38:24.608
Open fire!

01:38:40.332 --> 01:38:44.753
The Japanese army is here!

01:40:49.544 --> 01:40:50.921
That bastard!

01:43:19.736 --> 01:43:22.531
What do we do now?

01:43:23.073 --> 01:43:26.034
Shit! Forget the map! Let's go!

01:48:07.357 --> 01:48:09.317
Stupid son of a bitch!

01:48:09.859 --> 01:48:12.070
Fight till the end!

01:48:13.238 --> 01:48:17.283
Son of a bitch!

01:49:18.136 --> 01:49:19.262
Shit!

01:49:19.762 --> 01:49:20.763
You scared me!

01:49:20.930 --> 01:49:22.098
Found it after all, huh?

01:49:22.265 --> 01:49:25.101
Park Do-won!
Following me all the way here!

01:49:25.768 --> 01:49:28.605
Where'd you go? I missed 'ya.

01:49:30.857 --> 01:49:32.942
This is the place.

01:49:33.943 --> 01:49:35.445
It's right here.

01:49:45.121 --> 01:49:47.916
What's this smell?
The treasure's rotting?

01:49:52.795 --> 01:49:53.795
Dig!

01:49:53.838 --> 01:49:56.799
Ah, sure. I'll dig!

01:50:15.485 --> 01:50:18.112
But why am I the only one digging?

01:50:20.657 --> 01:50:25.036
We split it 60-40, so I dig first,
is that it?

01:50:26.037 --> 01:50:27.288
You don't trust me, do you?

01:50:27.455 --> 01:50:28.581
Bingo.

01:50:29.749 --> 01:50:31.209
Not till I see it first.

01:50:32.961 --> 01:50:34.837
Think I could ever trust you?

01:50:36.047 --> 01:50:37.632
Think this is a joke?

01:50:38.675 --> 01:50:39.926
Go on. Dig.

01:50:40.677 --> 01:50:42.637
Put the gun away while you can.

01:50:44.847 --> 01:50:47.642
Then you think you can beat me?

01:50:48.768 --> 01:50:50.311
Are you trying to be funny?

01:50:51.354 --> 01:50:52.814
The reward on you shot up.

01:50:53.648 --> 01:50:54.816
Real high!

01:50:57.235 --> 01:51:00.780
Tragedy at a happy moment like this.

01:51:03.241 --> 01:51:05.285
Damn!

01:51:06.035 --> 01:51:08.329
You escaped my punch, huh?

01:51:12.041 --> 01:51:13.126
Come here you!

01:51:13.876 --> 01:51:15.211
Put 'em up!

01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:30.810
You're on thin ice, man.

01:52:03.343 --> 01:52:05.887
What the hell is this?
Is it a treasure house?

01:52:19.609 --> 01:52:20.818
Where's it coming from?

01:52:32.121 --> 01:52:33.623
Park Chang-yi, that bastard!

01:52:38.836 --> 01:52:40.588
The sick bastards!

01:52:47.553 --> 01:52:48.553
What the hell is that?

01:53:09.742 --> 01:53:10.868
I knew it.

01:53:12.036 --> 01:53:13.788
There's no treasure here.

01:53:18.751 --> 01:53:21.712
Know what I thought about
while coming out here?

01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:26.342
I lost everything.

01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:29.137
All thanks to you, two.

01:53:29.762 --> 01:53:31.347
They died like dogs.

01:53:32.849 --> 01:53:34.725
Died in vain.

01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:37.687
Actually, no one dies in vain.

01:53:38.438 --> 01:53:40.398
Only those left behind feel empty.

01:53:41.441 --> 01:53:43.317
So I've decided...

01:53:44.986 --> 01:53:46.863
To fill the void...

01:53:47.655 --> 01:53:51.075
I'm gonna play a game with you, two.

01:53:54.036 --> 01:53:57.123
A way to get rid of both of you
at once.

01:53:59.250 --> 01:54:01.043
A fun game.

01:54:05.673 --> 01:54:07.842
A game to decide who is the best.

01:54:08.551 --> 01:54:11.095
Where no one knows
who will shoot whom.

01:54:12.346 --> 01:54:14.891
Where only one man survives.

01:54:18.227 --> 01:54:21.230
Right here, right now.

01:54:21.856 --> 01:54:26.611
I'll kill both of you.

01:54:27.862 --> 01:54:29.822
That'll never happen.

01:54:32.241 --> 01:54:34.410
I'll shoot you down first.

01:54:35.661 --> 01:54:37.747
We'll see about that.

01:54:38.748 --> 01:54:40.625
Tempted, aren't 'ya?

01:54:45.922 --> 01:54:47.590
Come out Yoon Tae-goo!

01:54:56.891 --> 01:54:59.352
That's it? That's all?

01:54:59.852 --> 01:55:03.814
Killing us to fill your void in life?

01:55:04.941 --> 01:55:08.611
That's just stupid! You moron!

01:55:08.778 --> 01:55:11.322
Why the hell did you chase me
all the way out here for?

01:55:11.656 --> 01:55:13.449
To find out who's the best!

01:55:13.574 --> 01:55:17.620
You can have it!
Have the honors, I don't care!

01:55:17.745 --> 01:55:20.206
Tell people I lost,
I don't give a damn!

01:55:20.331 --> 01:55:25.795
If that's your reason for living,
mine's finding the treasure!

01:55:25.962 --> 01:55:29.006
We don't see eye to eye, man.
Got that?

01:55:29.131 --> 01:55:30.633
<i>So, see 'Va-.</i>

01:55:31.467 --> 01:55:33.928
Then how's this!

01:55:36.264 --> 01:55:37.431
Reason enough for 'ya?

01:55:42.144 --> 01:55:43.938
How's that for a start?

01:55:47.358 --> 01:55:49.902
The survivor takes it all.

01:56:09.171 --> 01:56:13.134
Looks good to me.
But why drag me into this?

01:56:14.844 --> 01:56:17.346
Can't call it a real game
without Park Do-won.

01:56:19.265 --> 01:56:20.516
Think you got the skills?

01:56:23.853 --> 01:56:25.521
We'll see about that.

01:56:29.442 --> 01:56:32.570
Reason enough for me.
Tae-goo's in, too.

01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:41.621
You crazy sons of bitches.

01:56:41.746 --> 01:56:45.708
It's 'cuz I can't stand you two.

01:56:45.875 --> 01:56:48.210
So split it between 'ya.
I don't care!

01:56:48.377 --> 01:56:49.712
I'm outta here!

01:56:49.879 --> 01:56:50.879
Ciao!

01:56:51.964 --> 01:56:53.215
Damn!

01:56:55.676 --> 01:56:58.512
They're asking for it.

01:57:24.747 --> 01:57:26.749
Still got my finger?

01:57:29.251 --> 01:57:30.920
Finger Chopper!

01:58:13.045 --> 01:58:14.296
Hear that?

01:58:17.258 --> 01:58:18.634
Was it fun?

01:58:57.047 --> 01:58:58.424
Remember?

01:58:59.842 --> 01:59:01.635
Wonsan, five years ago.

01:59:02.678 --> 01:59:03.929
Winter.

01:59:06.557 --> 01:59:08.642
I never forgot that day.

01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:13.522
Park Chang-yi.

01:59:15.316 --> 01:59:18.027
I left everything behind
when I left Korea.

01:59:19.528 --> 01:59:21.197
So you forget it, too.

01:59:28.537 --> 01:59:30.623
How can I ever forget!

01:59:38.047 --> 01:59:40.132
There's no way out of this one.

01:59:41.258 --> 01:59:42.802
Guess you're stuck, Tae-goo.

01:59:43.844 --> 01:59:45.513
Or should I say, Finger Chopper.

01:59:48.432 --> 01:59:50.518
You're diggin' your graves.

01:59:54.146 --> 01:59:55.898
Don't regret this, boys.

01:59:57.650 --> 01:59:58.818
Let's roll.

02:04:27.336 --> 02:04:28.629
What the...

02:04:32.674 --> 02:04:34.718
What the hell is that?

02:05:13.966 --> 02:05:15.551
I came to the wrong place?

02:06:09.271 --> 02:06:11.231
Why am I so heavy?

02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:42.721
Never thought the past would
come back to haunt me.

02:06:46.850 --> 02:06:49.228
Forget everything, man.

02:06:49.978 --> 02:06:52.814
You're goin' to hell anyways.

02:06:53.565 --> 02:06:56.902
This is for your trip there.

02:07:00.239 --> 02:07:05.827
Coming all this way for nothing.

02:07:05.953 --> 02:07:08.830
God damn it.

02:08:17.858 --> 02:08:19.109
Damn Korean!

02:08:19.234 --> 02:08:22.404
Retreat! Retreat!

02:08:38.545 --> 02:08:41.590
Damn luck! Shit!

02:09:04.279 --> 02:09:06.239
<i>Dead</i>

02:09:21.338 --> 02:09:24.299
<i>Wanted: Yoon Tae-goo
Reward 3500 won</i>

02:09:36.561 --> 02:09:37.813
What do you want?

02:09:38.271 --> 02:09:39.523
You know Yoon Tae-goo, right?

02:09:46.530 --> 02:09:47.989
Tell me where he is.

02:09:48.323 --> 02:09:49.324
What?

02:09:49.950 --> 02:09:52.452
Where's Yoon Tae-goo!
You bastard!

02:10:11.179 --> 02:10:12.639
I'll ask you one last time.

02:10:13.265 --> 02:10:14.641
Where's Yoon Tae-goo?
