00:02.544 --> 00:05.377
Great dragon:
In a land of myth and a time of magic...

00:05.547 --> 00:08.038
The destiny of a great kingdom...

00:08.258 --> 00:10.795
Rests on the shoulders
of a young man.

00:11.220 --> 00:14.883
His name: Merlin.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.182
I think it's been a good trip.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.267
Yeah, we all caught something.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.595
Including Merlin.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.684
What did he catch?

00:25.067 --> 00:26.398
A cold.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.518
Arthur: If you'd learn to track,
you'd enjoy it more.

00:29.696 --> 00:30.902
I'm the best tracker here.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.018
Arthur.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.598
What is it?

01:04.772 --> 01:06.183
A deer?

01:08.026 --> 01:09.232
A boar?

01:10.028 --> 01:11.234
Percival.: Arthur?

01:17.035 --> 01:18.445
Saxons.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.003
They were after the cargo.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.044
Weapons bound for Camelot.

01:39.808 --> 01:40.843
Morgana?

01:41.018 --> 01:42.724
This close to the city walls?

01:42.978 --> 01:44.809
Arthur: Check for survivors.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.076
Kara.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.297
Go. Kara, go.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.600
- What happened?
- Thought I saw someone.

02:25.771 --> 02:26.977
I was wrong. Probably a deer.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.182
Arthur: You sure?

02:28.357 --> 02:29.688
Yeah

02:30.692 --> 02:32.148
move out.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.237
I don't want that.
I want lungwort.

03:26.415 --> 03:27.700
Maybe it's in the thing.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.501
What is it, Merlin?
What's the matter?

03:33.672 --> 03:34.672
Mordred.

03:35.674 --> 03:38.416
You're worrying about
what the sorceress told you?

03:38.593 --> 03:39.958
Finna was right.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.176
I must not trust mordred.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.674
He's a loyal knight.
He's proved it time after time.

03:46.852 --> 03:49.889
He's beguiled you.
He's beguiled you all.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.891
You're wrong, Merlin.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.397
When we were out on patrol...

03:54.568 --> 03:56.684
A Saxon escaped
and mordred let him.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.477
Are you sure? Saw him.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.566
There must be a simple explanation.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.151
I can't believe that, Gaius.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.987
Not after all I've been told.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.493
He's fond of the king.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.779
The feeling is mutual.
They've become great friends.

04:08.999 --> 04:12.207
That's my fear.
Arthur's blind to him. I'm not.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.413
I won't make that same mistake.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.672
We have patients waiting.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.759
Have you got everything? Yes.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.469
Merlin?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.706
Mordred: Kara.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.294
Kara: Mordred.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.751
Mordred.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.924
Mordred.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.427
Mordred.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.613
We believe they approached
from the gorge at Wesley...

06:52.787 --> 06:56.075
And tracked the ridgeline all the way
through to the Ford at rushwick.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.956
Can't allow our supply routes
to become vulnerable.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.119
I want extra patrols dispatched to the west
and the north of the citadel

07:02.547 --> 07:04.208
we ride at first light.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.292
I eon?

07:10.513 --> 07:12.378
I need not remind you we're at war.

07:16.645 --> 07:17.930
Guinevere: What's troubling you?

07:20.607 --> 07:23.849
Morgana's men attacked only
a few leagues away from the citadel.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.233
She is brazen.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.813
She does not fear us.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.400
Then she's more foolish than I thought.

07:29.574 --> 07:30.814
She has sorcery on her side.

07:30.992 --> 07:34.280
And you have the strength
and love of your people, Arthur.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.786
When you became king,
you gave them something to fight for.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.786
That's the most powerful weapon of all.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.405
Could you believe?

08:12.617 --> 08:14.198
No

08:15.912 --> 08:17.322
If it hadn't been you...

08:17.497 --> 08:18.612
I know.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.660
Your leg.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.746
It isn't deep.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.538
I et me see.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.470
I'll clean it

08:39.436 --> 08:41.267
These will help you heal.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.026
What are we going to do?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.031
I'm gonna help you get better.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.818
- You're a knight.
- Well, that doesn't matter.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.612
Of Camelot.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.164
Why, mordred?

09:05.962 --> 09:07.293
Arthur is a good man.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.334
I can't believe you'd say that.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.714
You don't know him.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.591
He's your friend?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.844
Yes

09:19.851 --> 09:21.637
does he know who you are?

09:23.271 --> 09:24.727
You're a druid.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.014
You don't belong in Camelot.

09:28.359 --> 09:29.769
I believe in Arthur.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.645
You'll see. One day...

09:34.240 --> 09:35.776
It will change.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.699
You're safe here.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.284
No one will harm you.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.122
I promise.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.260
Where have you been?

10:05.230 --> 10:06.310
Nowhere.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.725
You're lying.

10:09.943 --> 10:13.151
What right have you to question me?

10:15.281 --> 10:16.942
Why are you doing this?

10:19.327 --> 10:21.989
Everything I do, you think the worst.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.700
I saw you...

10:29.587 --> 10:31.123
Let a Saxon go.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.167
Maybe I should tell Arthur?
Merlin

10:37.971 --> 10:39.552
she's a druid.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.222
I knew her.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.969
She was wounded.
What could I do? Let her be captured?

10:47.147 --> 10:49.684
She had an arrow in her leg.
She cannot walk.

10:49.858 --> 10:50.973
You're taking a risk.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.773
Can't let her die.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.231
She's

10:57.157 --> 10:58.772
someone...

11:01.244 --> 11:02.324
Well, I can't explain.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.495
Where is she?

11:04.164 --> 11:06.405
She needs a few days.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.996
She'll be gone. She means no harm.
Please, you mustn't tell anyone.

11:10.253 --> 11:12.494
You know if Arthur catches her.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.250
She'll be killed

11:15.758 --> 11:17.339
please, Merlin. I beg you.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.094
She's one of us.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.261
Promise me.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.346
Your secret 1s safe with me.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.272
You have my word.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.186
Arthur: Merlin?

11:45.955 --> 11:47.240
What are you doing?

11:47.415 --> 11:48.530
I'm like a swan.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.294
It seems I'm not doing anything...

11:54.464 --> 11:57.126
But there's a lot of work
going on underneath.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.881
Hmm. Interesting.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.668
I see you more as a head louse.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.006
Right?

12:03.556 --> 12:05.137
Useless, irritating.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.183
Come on. We've got a patrol to mount.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.319
Merlin. Here.

12:25.787 --> 12:28.324
It's all about staying alert.
What do you see?

12:28.498 --> 12:30.989
I see a pair of breeches
that need cleaning.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.828
Have a look.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.334
Closer.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.966
Now what do you see?

12:43.429 --> 12:45.294
Two pairs of breeches that need cleaning.

12:45.515 --> 12:46.800
- On the branch.
- It's broken

12:46.975 --> 12:49.557
- what does that tell you?
- Something left the trail.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.099
It's recent.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.556
An animal?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.103
- You think so?
- I do.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.639
It'd have to be a big one.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.273
With very big antlers.

12:58.069 --> 13:01.232
- What makes you say that?
- Because it's looking at us.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.114
It's all about keeping alert.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.615
Come on.

13:16.838 --> 13:18.544
That's not a deer.

13:38.276 --> 13:39.561
Merlin

13:43.072 --> 13:45.688
they're from when
we were here yesterday.

13:45.867 --> 13:49.109
It was dry yesterday, it rained last night.
These marks are fresh.

13:49.412 --> 13:52.654
Our men have been patrolling this area
night and day. It's probably one of them.

13:52.832 --> 13:56.416
Who? I have their reports.
No one's been through here.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.166
Arthur?

14:57.021 --> 14:58.682
Don't hurt me.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.396
Careful

15:04.821 --> 15:06.482
Arthur, she's wounded.

15:07.532 --> 15:08.647
Please?

15:09.492 --> 15:11.153
I mean you no harm.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.970
You would have killed me.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.424
I'm only sorry I failed.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.012
- Why?
- I didn't tell him.

16:19.187 --> 16:20.723
- You gave me your word!
- I swear.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.429
You did it because you hate me.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.600
- No.
- This time you've gone too far.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.477
You'll pay, Merlin.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.986
Leon: What's going on?

16:32.617 --> 16:33.823
What's this about?

16:34.911 --> 16:36.492
Nothing.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.079
Merlin?

16:45.171 --> 16:46.286
Nothing.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.584
Were you part of a cohort of saxons...

16:53.846 --> 16:58.055
Who attacked an armed shipment
bound for Camelot?

16:58.518 --> 16:59.803
Yes

17:01.103 --> 17:04.095
were you acting under the orders
of morgana pendragon?

17:04.898 --> 17:06.638
What I did, I did for myself...

17:07.443 --> 17:08.522
For my people...

17:09.237 --> 17:11.022
And for our right to be free.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.567
I have no quarrel with the druids.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.866
I've spent my life on the run
because of my beliefs.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.819
And seen those I have loved killed.

17:20.748 --> 17:21.954
Once, maybe.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.867
But I'm not my father.

17:24.085 --> 17:26.416
You don't kill those with magic?

17:28.214 --> 17:32.833
It is not I, Arthur pendragon,
who needs to answer for my crimes.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.800
It is you.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.798
You and your father have
brutally and mercilessly...

17:39.976 --> 17:42.012
Nheaped misery on my kind.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.434
It is you who has turned
a peaceful people to war.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.649
And it is you...

17:51.696 --> 17:53.232
And Camelot.

17:53.447 --> 17:56.530
- That shall pay the price.
- In your words...

17:57.743 --> 17:59.904
I hear the voice of morgana.

18:03.082 --> 18:07.917
It is she and others like her
who have abused the powers of magic.

18:08.129 --> 18:11.292
It is they who have brought the rift
between our people.

18:13.134 --> 18:14.999
It is their deeds

18:15.469 --> 18:17.505
that have terrorized Camelot.

18:18.306 --> 18:21.969
And forced us to outlaw such practices.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.425
But you stand before the court...

18:24.645 --> 18:28.604
Not because of an act of sorcery
or sedition

18:30.234 --> 18:32.475
but because of an act of murder.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.940
Your actions have brought about
the deaths of many good men.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.739
Threatened the lives of many more.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.788
They were casualties of war.

18:47.418 --> 18:49.033
And I would do the same again.

18:49.211 --> 18:52.999
For I will not rest until you are dead
and your kingdom is no more.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.671
Yet you have friends here.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.637
Somehow you got treatment for your leg.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.049
From someone in Camelot

19:06.103 --> 19:07.138
who?

19:10.232 --> 19:11.688
I treated myself.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.975
You are lying.

19:15.237 --> 19:18.946
Whoever it was
left a trail of footprints in the mud.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.529
Footprints that resulted in your capture.

19:23.621 --> 19:26.704
A stranger came across me
and he helped me.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.623
I have no idea who he was.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.577
You show no remorse for your actions.

19:33.130 --> 19:36.088
I have no choice but to declare you
an enemy of Camelot.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.708
At dawn tomorrow...

19:38.928 --> 19:40.589
Pursuant to the laws of this land...

19:40.763 --> 19:42.378
You will be taken from your cell...

19:43.432 --> 19:44.672
And hanged.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.558
You can do as you wish.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.690
It will not stop morgana's uprising.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.608
Your doom is near.

20:01.492 --> 20:04.199
My only sadness is
I won't be there to see jt

20:34.734 --> 20:36.099
Mordred: Kara?

20:51.917 --> 20:54.408
The king has sent me to speak to you.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.086
He is frustrated

21:00.551 --> 21:04.544
that you did not betray
the person who helped you.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.266
You are very loyal.

21:12.396 --> 21:15.854
That person is very dear to me.

21:21.363 --> 21:24.070
I will never tell anyone.

21:26.327 --> 21:29.160
I would rather die than see them harmed.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.604
I will speak with the king.

21:59.693 --> 22:02.776
He will never show mercy
to someone like me.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.774
I will not.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.159
Let you die.

22:44.655 --> 22:46.236
Yes?

22:50.119 --> 22:52.201
Ah, mordred. What is it?

22:57.585 --> 22:58.916
It was me.

22:59.503 --> 23:02.995
I was the one who took the herbs
to the druid girl.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.794
Arthur, I'm asking you...

23:06.010 --> 23:08.001
Please to reconsider your sentence.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.424
She's not to blame.

23:15.853 --> 23:18.435
Morgana is using her
in her quest for power.

23:19.315 --> 23:20.350
You know this girl.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.684
She is

23:26.196 --> 23:27.231
someone...

23:30.367 --> 23:32.653
Since I was a child.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.741
She's always lived inside my heart.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.406
Okay.

23:44.298 --> 23:47.210
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

23:48.302 --> 23:50.008
You're a knight of Camelot.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.502
It's a bond we share.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.092
But what you ask...

23:57.227 --> 24:01.766
This girl, she is a danger.
Not just to me.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.606
She's a sworn enemy of Camelot.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.688
Ruthless to the cause. No.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.479
I will change that. She'll listen to me.

24:09.657 --> 24:13.525
I cannot risk the lives of my citizens,
mordred, no matter who asks.

24:15.996 --> 24:17.736
I beg you, Arthur.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.042
She's admitted her guilt.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.580
I have no option.

24:32.846 --> 24:34.382
I'm sorry.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.677
Sire.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.986
What of the bond between knights?

24:51.198 --> 24:52.859
The law must be applied.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.027
It is Paramount.

24:55.411 --> 24:57.402
You're breaking his heart.

24:59.123 --> 25:00.738
You'll lose his trust.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.538
- Think again?
- There's nothing I can do.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.879
In time, mordred will understand that.

25:10.968 --> 25:12.378
He'll come to forgive me.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.261
I fear you're wrong, Arthur.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.683
Only time will tell.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.612
He would not listen.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.746
He has made his decision.

25:47.713 --> 25:48.748
I tried.

25:49.590 --> 25:50.625
It's too late.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.635
No, Kara.

25:56.847 --> 25:58.508
He doesn't care.

25:59.308 --> 26:04.018
No matter what he preaches,
he is no different from his father.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.056
A tyrant.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.521
Brute.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.693
I thought he and I were friends.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.650
He's a pendragon.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.191
You did all you could.

26:55.489 --> 26:56.524
Arthur: Mordred?

26:59.076 --> 27:00.612
I wanted to

27:03.747 --> 27:05.283
to apologize.

27:06.250 --> 27:09.333
- There's no need.
- I'm sorry for what I did.

27:11.672 --> 27:13.503
I hope you'll forgive me.

27:14.133 --> 27:17.250
I'd never let something like this
ruin our friendship.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.047
You took me in.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.055
I will always remember that.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.803
And everything you've done for me.

27:26.019 --> 27:31.139
You've rewarded me
by becoming my most loyal of knights.

27:32.276 --> 27:34.562
Thank you, sire.

27:52.254 --> 27:53.915
I knew he'd come around.

27:59.595 --> 28:00.926
What are you doing?

28:02.472 --> 28:03.632
You're leaving.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.095
Are you going to take her with you?

28:11.064 --> 28:13.020
Do not stand in my way.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.855
- I don't want anyone to get hurt.
- Mordred.

28:18.405 --> 28:21.488
Kara is sentenced to die in the morning.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.991
What would you do? You can't

28:25.204 --> 28:29.447
tell me you wouldn't do the same
for the woman you love.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.366
That'd be foolish.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.994
You see”?

28:38.008 --> 28:39.418
You cannot.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.424
Mordred.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.219
Please.

28:50.771 --> 28:53.262
I know you did not betray me before.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.814
Do not do so now.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.814
Gaius: It's nothing you haven't
done yourself a hundred times before.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.357
- This is different.
- How?

29:06.036 --> 29:08.493
Mordred isn't just gonna set Kara free...

29:08.664 --> 29:10.074
He's going to leave with her.

29:10.249 --> 29:13.082
If he does, there'd be no chance
of reconciliation with Arthur.

29:13.669 --> 29:16.331
Arthur's decision's already
set mordred against him.

29:16.505 --> 29:20.339
With that girl at his side, he turns
straight into the arms of morgana.

29:20.634 --> 29:23.091
You cannot want Kara to die.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.097
But I don't want Arthur to either.

29:29.309 --> 29:32.051
As long as mordred is within these walls,
there's still hope.

29:32.229 --> 29:33.935
I have to stop him.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.642
(Saius.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.653
I have no choice.

29:54.668 --> 29:56.374
- Merlin?
- I'm sorry.

29:56.545 --> 29:59.161
My lady, I need to speak with Arthur.
It's important.

29:59.339 --> 30:00.875
It better be.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.001
It's mordred.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.253
What is it?

30:04.428 --> 30:05.884
Arthur.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.422
Are you going to tell me?

30:10.642 --> 30:12.007
He, uh...

30:15.480 --> 30:16.515
Well?

30:17.899 --> 30:20.811
He's going to help the druid girl escape.

30:42.424 --> 30:43.960
Rally the guards.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.035
He's a Camelot soldier.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.259
We're searching the citadel.

31:37.437 --> 31:38.997
No, they'll be gone. Search the forest.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.058
I want them captured. “Alive?

31:41.525 --> 31:43.641
They're fugitives. The law is clear.

31:44.361 --> 31:45.976
Dispatch as many riders as you can.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.566
All personal feelings aside.

32:10.053 --> 32:11.418
You need to rest.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.211
We can't.

32:23.733 --> 32:25.143
Over here.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.109
Thought I saw something.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.653
You go.

33:13.033 --> 33:14.364
Please.

33:14.534 --> 33:15.819
I won't leave you.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.493
Arthur: Mordred!

33:52.489 --> 33:54.070
Kara: Use your magic.

33:54.241 --> 33:55.697
Kill them!

33:58.119 --> 33:59.950
They are my friends.

34:00.789 --> 34:02.199
Give yourselves up.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.123
Let her go.

34:12.132 --> 34:16.297
We will leave Camelot and never return.
You have my word.

34:18.306 --> 34:19.887
Please.

34:24.938 --> 34:26.849
(Waine?

34:29.192 --> 34:30.728
I eon?

34:33.112 --> 34:36.525
Kara: Use your magic. Do it!

35:16.323 --> 35:18.234
What are you gonna do to me?

35:20.118 --> 35:21.358
I wish I knew.

35:33.798 --> 35:37.791
Mordred:
Why couldn't you just let things be?

35:42.307 --> 35:45.424
The very thing I was trying to stop
just happened.

35:46.311 --> 35:48.518
There are some parts
woven so deeply...

35:48.688 --> 35:50.553
Into the fabric
of the world, Merlin...

35:50.732 --> 35:53.314
That nothing could be
done to change them.

35:59.616 --> 36:04.531
There must be an answer.
Some way out of this. Perhaps...

36:08.249 --> 36:09.329
Af

36:09.501 --> 36:12.262
- If Arthur was to repeal the sentence...
- He won't change his mind.

36:12.379 --> 36:13.994
But if I could manage to persuade him...

36:14.714 --> 36:17.626
Then mordred would no longer
be set against Arthur...

36:17.801 --> 36:21.760
He'd be, you know, indebted to him.

36:22.097 --> 36:23.587
You know Arthur.

36:23.765 --> 36:25.596
I cannot see him agreeing.

36:28.478 --> 36:29.888
I have to try.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.015
It's my only chance.

36:37.946 --> 36:40.062
Merlin:
I know it's not my place to speak.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.612
- Arthur...
- I know what you're going to say.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.739
- The girl?
- Her fate's sealed

36:47.914 --> 36:49.950
it's mordred's that concerns me.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.365
Should I allow him to go free?

36:55.213 --> 36:56.293
Free them both.

36:57.716 --> 37:00.628
The girl's murdered innocent men
in cold blood.

37:01.094 --> 37:03.050
We're at war. I must be resolute.

37:03.847 --> 37:06.884
Well, how will one more death
bring about the peace we long for?

37:07.392 --> 37:08.632
She's young.

37:08.810 --> 37:11.973
I don't believe she's beyond redemption.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.099
You've withessed their love for each other.

37:14.274 --> 37:16.731
That's something far greater
than a desire to serve morgana...

37:16.901 --> 37:19.392
Or her cause. Give her one more chance.
She'll take it.

37:19.863 --> 37:21.694
As king, I'm sworn to uphold the law.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.666
It's the future of Camelot
that concerns me.

37:23.825 --> 37:26.316
Please, Arthur,
you have to listen to me.

37:26.494 --> 37:28.075
It's my decision.

37:30.123 --> 37:31.909
My decision alone.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.471
Mordred:
If I hadn't come to you...

37:56.649 --> 37:58.605
I would have died from my wound.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.986
It was my fault.

38:07.076 --> 38:09.283
I have no one to blame but myself.

38:11.039 --> 38:12.324
I chose my path.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.240
I have just one regret.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.213
Only one regret.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.598
Kara.

38:45.073 --> 38:47.485
We've come to take her to the king.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.606
Arthur:
Every person present knows the crimes...

39:22.777 --> 39:24.267
For which you are guilty.

39:26.239 --> 39:28.901
But I'm willing to offer you a chance.

39:30.451 --> 39:33.909
Arthur: I know that the
druids are a peaceful people.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.992
You are young...

39:37.584 --> 39:39.074
And impressionable.

39:40.336 --> 39:42.452
An easy target for the likes of morgana.

39:44.757 --> 39:47.043
If you repent your crimes...

39:48.303 --> 39:50.043
I will spare your life.

39:56.436 --> 39:59.599
I cannot repent a crime
I have not committed.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.142
Kara.

40:06.613 --> 40:09.605
It is not a crime
to fight for your freedom.

40:11.534 --> 40:16.198
It is not a crime to fight for the right
to be who you are.

40:18.207 --> 40:22.871
You deserve everything
that's coming to you, Arthur pendragon.

41:44.210 --> 41:46.917
Merlin:
It's almost like he's vanished.

41:47.088 --> 41:50.046
The guards searched as far as the river.
There was no sign.

41:50.299 --> 41:51.960
I let him in.

41:54.178 --> 41:57.136
You have a good heart.
Don't blame yourself for that.

41:57.306 --> 41:59.262
I shouldn't have trusted him.

42:08.317 --> 42:10.774
I've made a terrible mistake, haven't I?

42:12.613 --> 42:14.023
I hope not.

42:51.903 --> 42:54.144
My old friend.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.777
Last time we met, you tried to kill me.

42:58.951 --> 43:01.567
I am here for a purpose, morgana.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.993
I did not break stride to find you.

43:07.960 --> 43:10.702
I bring you the news you have longed for.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.623
Arthur's death?

43:15.802 --> 43:17.508
The key to it.

43:18.721 --> 43:20.882
I was wrong to ever
question your wisdom, my lady...

43:21.057 --> 43:22.638
And I wish to make amends.

43:22.850 --> 43:23.885
Tell me.

43:24.560 --> 43:27.302
There is someone
you have been searching for.

43:28.231 --> 43:30.722
Someone who has always eluded you.

43:32.860 --> 43:34.191
Emrys.

43:35.530 --> 43:36.986
I know where he is.

43:37.949 --> 43:38.949
Where?

43:39.158 --> 43:40.614
Camelot.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.860
And I have his true name.

43:47.667 --> 43:48.952
It is Merlin.

44:07.728 --> 44:11.437
Arthur is nothing without emrys
and emrys is nothing without magic.

44:24.328 --> 44:25.443
No!
