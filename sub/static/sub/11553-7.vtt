00:14.933 --> 00:17.310
Trust me, I'm your friend.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.568
Bawk! Run for your lives!

00:27.153 --> 00:28.529
Finger five on it!

00:51.970 --> 00:53.638
We are all wondering...

00:53.722 --> 00:56.391
Is Police Commissioner Decker
qualified enough

00:56.474 --> 00:59.185
to capture the fugitive known as Kong?

01:01.730 --> 01:05.817
Or is his police force just too primitive
to handle the giant primate?

01:10.238 --> 01:11.530
Help!

01:15.451 --> 01:17.828
Despite our intrepid
commissioner's best efforts

01:17.912 --> 01:19.914
to capture the King of Apes,

01:19.998 --> 01:23.376
Kong has escaped again, and again,
and again!

01:23.459 --> 01:26.212
All right, you're a star, Kong!

01:26.295 --> 01:27.713
You're number one!

01:27.797 --> 01:30.509
Numero uno! Bawk!

01:30.591 --> 01:32.050
Yeah, bro.

01:32.135 --> 01:35.554
But, unfortunately,
you're public enemy numero uno.

01:37.473 --> 01:39.267
You should put your footprints in cement

01:39.350 --> 01:41.477
like at that super old theater
in Hollywood.

01:51.029 --> 01:53.990
That's right!
No butts about it!

02:01.122 --> 02:02.957
Well, maybe Lucky's butt!

02:14.427 --> 02:15.803
Uh-oh.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.312
Opinions on Commissioner Decker's
performance?

02:24.395 --> 02:27.690
Decker's an incompetent laughingstock
and he should resign.

02:33.154 --> 02:36.574
The majority agrees,
but will the commissioner listen?

02:36.658 --> 02:38.993
We'll return to our special report,

02:39.077 --> 02:42.956
"Kong Makes a Monkey Out of Police,"
right after Storm Watch.

02:45.124 --> 02:47.669
Those ingrates have no idea
what I go through

02:47.752 --> 02:49.879
to keep them safe from that mutant!

02:53.591 --> 02:57.136
It appears as though our guest
has arrived, Botila.

02:58.137 --> 03:01.975
Lukas is your twin brother.
You grew up together.

03:02.058 --> 03:06.563
You must know something that can help us
find out where he and his ape are hiding.

03:06.645 --> 03:07.730
One would think.

03:08.647 --> 03:11.400
I assumed they were hiding
in the Redwoods,

03:11.484 --> 03:15.238
but we've gone over them with
a fine-toothed comb and found nothing.

03:15.321 --> 03:17.490
Based on range,

03:17.573 --> 03:21.285
calculated by Kong's response time
to previous local threats,

03:21.369 --> 03:25.539
logic indicates that he must be
within this perimeter.

03:25.623 --> 03:28.083
Our old house.

03:28.167 --> 03:31.045
But that's the first place we searched...

03:31.129 --> 03:32.631
obviously.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.508
But perhaps not thoroughly enough.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.051
When we were children,

03:37.135 --> 03:39.888
Kong and Lukas would disappear
for hours on end,

03:39.971 --> 03:43.725
so it is possible they may
have some secret place near there.

03:43.808 --> 03:48.772
Obviously, if the ape has camouflage tech,
their hideout may, as well.

03:48.855 --> 03:51.357
Ah... smart.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.985
I wish I had you on my police force.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.820
Of course you do.

03:55.904 --> 04:00.158
I would have brought it up earlier,
but it seemed so... obvious.

04:00.241 --> 04:04.913
- Commissioner, I will be happy to assist...
- You've been very helpful.

04:04.996 --> 04:08.666
- Uh, can you shoot me a copy of that?
- Already done.

04:08.750 --> 04:12.295
- Why don't I at least...
- Thanks, but it's a police matter now.

04:12.378 --> 04:13.963
Once their hideout is exposed,

04:14.047 --> 04:17.425
my men are quite capable
of disposing of the monster ape.

04:17.507 --> 04:21.720
- My bionobotic dinosaurs...
- Have failed repeatedly.

04:21.805 --> 04:24.432
I can find my way out.

04:27.518 --> 04:32.065
Oh, he will have your assistance,
but not on his police force.

04:32.148 --> 04:37.236
I have something much more spectacular
in mind for your robotic skills.

04:42.826 --> 04:46.329
97, 98, 99...

04:46.412 --> 04:48.331
Hey, no peeking!

04:48.414 --> 04:50.416
It's bad enough I have to count for you.

04:52.043 --> 04:53.878
You did too peek.

04:53.962 --> 04:56.005
Your eye is, like,
bigger than a beach ball.

04:56.089 --> 04:58.007
How could I possibly miss it?

04:58.091 --> 05:01.719
Okay, let's try again.

05:01.803 --> 05:03.847
And no peeking.

05:06.975 --> 05:11.520
97, 98, 99... 100.

05:11.604 --> 05:13.231
Come and find me!

05:14.773 --> 05:17.235
He'll never find me.

05:18.987 --> 05:21.655
Get outta here, Lucky,
or you'll give me away.

05:24.742 --> 05:26.577
That's what I get
for playing hide and seek

05:26.660 --> 05:28.704
with a pocket full of liger treats.

05:28.787 --> 05:32.541
No, stop! That tickles!

05:36.129 --> 05:37.881
Whoa!

05:37.964 --> 05:41.675
You got me, Kong,
but you kind of had help.

05:47.723 --> 05:48.933
- Did you hear that?
- Check over there!

05:49.017 --> 05:50.476
Nothing here.

05:52.061 --> 05:55.148
Ugh, yuck!
Say it, don't spray...

05:56.440 --> 05:58.276
Police.
We gotta hide.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.069
If they see us, we're sunk.

06:02.780 --> 06:05.408
Shoo, Lucky. Shoo.
Don't let those guys find you.

06:09.412 --> 06:13.166
Time for us to shoo, too.
Be super quiet.

06:13.249 --> 06:15.793
Hide and seek just got real.

06:21.132 --> 06:23.176
Oops.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.390
Uh-oh.

06:29.473 --> 06:30.683
- I heard something!
- Let's move!

06:30.766 --> 06:31.976
Stay sharp.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.814
Weapons ready.

06:38.524 --> 06:39.817
This way!

06:42.987 --> 06:44.322
That way.

07:03.967 --> 07:08.387
It must've been the wind.
There's nothing out here. I'm calling in.

07:11.349 --> 07:16.312
How did things go so wrong
between these two?

07:16.395 --> 07:17.981
No sign of the ape, sir.

07:18.064 --> 07:21.567
Yeah? Well, keep looking.
He's out there somewhere.

07:21.650 --> 07:25.863
I'm sure of it.
I can practically smell him.

07:28.157 --> 07:30.243
Fool should have asked for my help.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.205
They're getting too close to the fort.

07:34.288 --> 07:37.250
We need to get rid of these guys
and warn the others.

07:47.260 --> 07:49.512
- What the heck's that smell?
- I didn't do it.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.555
Oh, don't look at me!

07:52.806 --> 07:54.725
Well, that's one way
to get 'em to clear out.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.065
Qué pasa, niños?

08:01.149 --> 08:02.900
What kind of way is this to...

08:02.984 --> 08:05.944
Police are right behind us.
We need camo. Fast.

08:06.029 --> 08:10.033
Kong, put on your jetpack and turn on
its camo-generator. Understand?

08:13.577 --> 08:15.329
I'll hide with Kong.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.166
Activating fort camo.

08:18.249 --> 08:19.583
No one say a word.

08:28.176 --> 08:29.718
There's nothing here, either.

08:29.802 --> 08:32.388
Oh, no, your prints.
Kong, blow 'em away.

08:33.931 --> 08:36.267
Where'd that gust come from?

08:36.350 --> 08:39.562
- This place is creeping me out.
- Something weird about these woods.

08:41.397 --> 08:43.524
Still no sign of the perps, Commissioner.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.818
What do you want us to do now, sir?

08:46.735 --> 08:49.405
Everyone back to base.

08:50.323 --> 08:51.907
It's over.

08:53.826 --> 08:55.619
It hasn't even begun.

08:55.703 --> 08:58.414
I knew those incompetents
would never find them.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.209
I, on the other hand,

09:01.292 --> 09:03.919
know how to make them come to me.

09:17.058 --> 09:19.310
I gotta make that thing last longer.

09:20.894 --> 09:21.895
Ya think?

09:23.522 --> 09:25.733
Why do you think the police
searched this area again

09:25.816 --> 09:27.193
after all this time?

09:28.986 --> 09:32.406
Not sure, Panchi,
but that hit a little too close to home.

09:32.490 --> 09:35.409
Home...
I gotta check something out.

09:35.493 --> 09:36.827
Everybody, stay on your toes.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.671
I may not be able to change the past,

09:47.755 --> 09:51.217
but I have the power to seize
control of the future.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.302
I finally came up with a fail-proof way

09:53.386 --> 09:56.972
to bring that relentless ape to his knees
and destroy him.

09:57.055 --> 10:00.184
Fail-proof until it fails.

10:00.268 --> 10:02.478
I'd yawn if I were physically able.

10:02.561 --> 10:06.899
Very humorous, Botila,
but I wouldn't laugh

10:06.982 --> 10:09.860
since you are the one
that better not fail.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.738
- Not computing.
- It's simple.

10:12.821 --> 10:16.492
This magnificent bionobot
possesses amazing power,

10:16.575 --> 10:18.536
but lacks intellect and skill.

10:18.619 --> 10:22.373
Once I transfer your AI consciousness
into its body,

10:22.456 --> 10:24.417
it will have both.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.253
With the battle prowess
I've programmed in you,

10:27.336 --> 10:29.463
plus T-Rex's superior strength,

10:29.547 --> 10:32.675
Kong doesn't stand a chance.

10:32.758 --> 10:36.887
- It will not work.
- Why? It's a brilliant idea.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.932
It will not work because I will not do it.

10:40.015 --> 10:44.853
I'm not asking you, Botila.
I'm commanding you.

10:44.937 --> 10:48.607
You cannot force me to do
what I do not want to do.

10:48.691 --> 10:52.486
Actually, this is the basis
of our relationship.

10:55.239 --> 10:58.201
You may experience some disorientation,

10:58.284 --> 10:59.952
but it will only last a moment...

11:00.703 --> 11:03.121
and then... voilà!

11:08.043 --> 11:11.964
So, how does it feel to possess
so much strength?

11:12.047 --> 11:16.051
I feel like crushing
something small and petty.

11:16.134 --> 11:19.513
Good! Then go take
that impulse out on Kong.

11:24.059 --> 11:27.605
I could always shut you down
if you refuse to cooperate.

11:27.688 --> 11:31.859
You will discover that it takes
more than an off-switch to control me.

11:34.152 --> 11:37.448
- This tail makes my butt look...
- Huge!

11:37.531 --> 11:39.199
It's nearly 13 meters.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.494
Ah! Careful with that thing!

11:42.453 --> 11:45.122
Richard, please return me to my body.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.082
Why would I do that?

11:47.165 --> 11:50.210
I can make a thousand robots like you

11:50.294 --> 11:52.838
to serve me in any form I want.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.966
I am one of a kind.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.719
The most advanced AI on this planet.

11:58.802 --> 12:02.598
Then act like it.
Get to work!

12:04.350 --> 12:07.144
- Did you hear that!
- What is it? The police?

12:07.227 --> 12:09.229
Sounds more like an entire SWAT team.

12:16.194 --> 12:17.280
They're upping the ante.

12:17.363 --> 12:20.157
But they'll destroy the entire forest.

12:28.123 --> 12:32.753
Show yourself, Kong,
or by the time Botila-Zilla's done,

12:32.836 --> 12:36.299
there won't be a tree standing for you
to hide behind.

12:51.063 --> 12:52.189
Save it.

12:52.272 --> 12:56.109
Your simian rage is no match
for my battle skills.

12:58.946 --> 13:01.365
Although these ridiculously tiny arms

13:01.449 --> 13:05.202
make any classic martial arts moves
virtually impossible.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.456
That T-Rex just spoke
with Botila's voice!

13:08.539 --> 13:11.750
Just when I thought dealing with Richard
couldn't get any weirder.

13:17.255 --> 13:20.217
Way weirder and way more dangerous.

13:23.512 --> 13:27.975
Hmm. Signal trace has the familiar profile
of Richard's tin dinosoldiers,

13:28.058 --> 13:31.061
but it's attached to some
sort of broadcast frequency.

13:32.730 --> 13:34.982
Yeah, I have no idea what you just said,

13:35.065 --> 13:38.361
but what's Botila doing
parked in front of my old house?

13:38.444 --> 13:41.071
Is she asleep, or is this another trap?

13:41.154 --> 13:44.324
Huh. I think she's been shut down.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.244
- I'm going inside.
- Go ahead.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.162
I'm gonna check out Sleeping Beauty here.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.882
Look out!

14:00.758 --> 14:03.010
Thanks for the save, Panchi.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.845
Here's another lesson.

14:22.363 --> 14:24.031
Oh, excellent!

14:31.038 --> 14:34.583
He learns fast, Butt-Zilla!

14:45.177 --> 14:48.639
Hey, Kong!
Botila-Zilla wants to teach you a lesson,

14:48.722 --> 14:50.891
so why don't you take her to school?

15:08.241 --> 15:13.497
I knew I'd find you still living here,
hiding like a rat in a basement.

15:13.581 --> 15:15.458
You didn't find me, Richard.

15:15.541 --> 15:17.501
- I found you.
- What?

15:17.585 --> 15:19.169
How dumb do you think I am?

15:19.252 --> 15:21.464
I wouldn't pick a hideout this obvious.

15:21.547 --> 15:24.508
But Dad loved it here,
so I keep an eye on the place...

15:24.592 --> 15:26.927
as well as keeping one on you.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.054
How do you think Kong's
able to throw a monkey wrench

15:29.137 --> 15:30.931
into every plan you hatch?

15:31.014 --> 15:34.017
Also, technically,
Kong's an ape, not a monkey.

15:35.227 --> 15:37.771
I will finish you now!

15:44.612 --> 15:47.197
This body is useless.

15:49.617 --> 15:52.745
No wonder dinosaurs became extinct.

15:52.828 --> 15:56.081
But these jaws aren't bad.

15:57.666 --> 16:00.503
Tell me Kong's gonna be okay!

16:00.586 --> 16:04.798
Uh... sure, he will.
Come on, Kong! You can take her!

16:09.177 --> 16:10.888
Told ya!

16:10.971 --> 16:14.558
Whew! Come on, Kong!
You gotta finish her!

16:26.319 --> 16:29.907
Never been this close to you
without getting a beat-down.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.659
Kind of strange.

16:31.742 --> 16:34.077
This is even stranger.

16:34.161 --> 16:37.205
Richard, you've got to get off
the destructive path you're on.

16:37.289 --> 16:41.084
I know the kid in that photograph
is still inside you somewhere.

16:42.670 --> 16:44.797
Not since that filthy ape of yours

16:44.880 --> 16:46.715
ruined everything!

16:52.513 --> 16:56.016
I am not programmed for emotion,
but if I were,

16:56.099 --> 16:58.852
you would be making me seriously angry.

17:05.608 --> 17:09.445
Honestly, who thought these stubby
little arms were a good idea?

17:12.616 --> 17:15.618
Ha! Nothin' wrong with Kong's arms!

17:17.954 --> 17:21.959
Huh? This is some interesting
malware Richard's put in here.

17:24.294 --> 17:27.047
Richard, I won't let you do this.

17:29.507 --> 17:33.846
My internal force field
makes your threats meaningless.

17:33.929 --> 17:36.223
What have you done to yourself?

17:36.306 --> 17:40.143
I've made myself
better than you, brother...

17:40.227 --> 17:42.312
better than any human.

17:47.568 --> 17:49.236
Batter up!

17:53.323 --> 17:56.159
I'll be back!

17:59.037 --> 18:03.626
That pathetic thing
won't even dent my force field.

18:03.709 --> 18:05.628
Incoming!

18:05.711 --> 18:07.420
Huh?

18:09.673 --> 18:12.342
And it's over the fence for a home run!

18:12.425 --> 18:15.137
Wow, and I thought
that bot was off before.

18:18.181 --> 18:20.017
Uh... what'd I do?

18:21.351 --> 18:25.522
Why is it becoming so hard
to keep my head on these days?

18:28.275 --> 18:30.068
- Jonesy.
- Botila.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.738
- Your hand.
- Whoa. Sorry.

18:32.821 --> 18:36.867
Don't apologize.
As a matter of fact, thank you.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.911
This is usually the part
where I try to stop you.

18:38.994 --> 18:43.957
Yes, but I'm feeling too grateful
to "hand you a beating," as you put it.

18:44.041 --> 18:45.375
Oh, you heard that.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.961
I hope that means
you won't forget my good deed.

18:48.045 --> 18:52.299
With my two trillion bionobytes of memory,
I cannot forget anything.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.259
Does that mean that you and I...

18:54.342 --> 19:00.223
Hmm. I calculate the odds of that
at 17,300,000 to one.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.685
So I still got a shot.

19:02.768 --> 19:07.189
- He's all yours.
- And what if I don't want him?

19:09.191 --> 19:11.944
By all rights, I should leave you here.

19:13.528 --> 19:17.991
You will do exactly as I...
Wait.

19:18.075 --> 19:21.870
How did you return your consciousness
to your body?

19:34.758 --> 19:38.011
Man, when Kong breaks 'em,
they stay busted.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.264
I guess some things can't be fixed.

19:48.396 --> 19:52.525
He managed to save almost every tree
Botila-Zilla knocked down.

19:56.279 --> 19:59.032
Today was too close for comfort.

19:59.116 --> 20:00.450
Copy that.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.036
We need to throw Richard and Decker
off our trail.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.456
I have an idea.
Who's up for a road trip?

20:08.792 --> 20:12.462
There has been a new Kong sighting
in the nearby Lake Tahoe area,

20:12.545 --> 20:13.964
which is where it is now believed

20:14.047 --> 20:18.093
that the monster ape and his master,
Lukas Remy, have been hiding out.

20:18.176 --> 20:22.723
However, earlier today,
Kong eluded San Francisco Police.

20:22.806 --> 20:24.725
The so-called "dumb ape"

20:24.808 --> 20:29.855
proving, once again, that he has
more brains than our police commissioner.

20:29.938 --> 20:33.901
Change course!
We're heading to Tahoe!

20:35.986 --> 20:37.821
Thanks for bringing me up here, bro.

20:41.074 --> 20:45.662
Reminds me of a simpler time...
before Richard got so bent.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.668
Seeing him like that today...

20:51.752 --> 20:54.838
it makes me wonder
what else he's done to himself...

20:54.922 --> 20:57.883
and what other unnatural disasters
he's planning.

20:58.801 --> 21:01.970
Every subordinate
I've engaged has failed me.

21:02.054 --> 21:05.223
If you want something done right,
do it yourself.

21:09.186 --> 21:11.855
I'm certain I can make it work.

21:11.939 --> 21:17.110
By my calculations,
this will not end well.
