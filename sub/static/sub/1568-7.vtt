WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:02.627
Previously on "The 100"...

00:03.837 --> 00:04.712
Where's Finn?

00:04.922 --> 00:05.672
Looking for you.

00:05.881 --> 00:06.923
I count 26.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.675
These people don't
look like warriors.

00:08.884 --> 00:09.634
What have you
done with them?

00:09.843 --> 00:11.594
Your friends
were not here.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.056
You need to go.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.100
You sent
an assassin into

00:17.309 --> 00:18.559
one of my villages.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.269
Later we will talk.
In the meantime,

00:20.479 --> 00:22.814
your friend will be used
to send a message.

00:23.023 --> 00:23.773
Uhh!

00:23.983 --> 00:25.566
Leave or die.

00:25.776 --> 00:28.778
Mark this one for
the Cerberus program.

00:28.988 --> 00:30.697
First dose
is the worst.

00:30.906 --> 00:33.282
It's Lincoln.
He's a reaper.

00:33.492 --> 00:34.826
No.

00:35.035 --> 00:35.868
Now we
take him home.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.203
There's
a containment breach.

00:37.413 --> 00:38.413
Even a little radiation
could kill them.

00:38.622 --> 00:39.664
If we were
to circulate

00:39.873 --> 00:41.541
Maya's blood
through your system...

00:41.750 --> 00:42.834
I could make her better.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.293
They exposed her to
radiation on purpose.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.421
The standard
treatment sucks.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.964
Those grounders?

00:48.173 --> 00:49.215
I won't leave
the others behind.

00:49.425 --> 00:50.425
What choice
do we have?

00:50.634 --> 00:52.552
I volunteer.
I'm impressed, Jasper,

00:52.761 --> 00:54.178
and deeply grateful.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.388
You saved us, right?

00:56.515 --> 00:57.515
It's the least
we could do.

01:53.864 --> 01:54.864
Uhh.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.670
Help me.
Open the door!

02:09.880 --> 02:12.799
4 minutes
and 10 seconds.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.425
We're making progress.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.718
Please. It hurts.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.887
She's in pain.
I'm bringing her in.

02:18.097 --> 02:19.055
Whoa, whoa.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.015
Do you trust her
not to talk?

02:31.110 --> 02:32.735
Might as well get
a full reading.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.866
"The blood of
the forty-seven

02:39.076 --> 02:40.576
could be our
permanent solution."

02:40.786 --> 02:41.953
That's what
you said.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.915
Science takes
time, Cage.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.668
There are dead ends
and blind alleys

02:48.877 --> 02:50.503
on the path to
every breakthrough.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.173
You call that
a blind alley?

02:54.383 --> 02:56.676
She's one of us.

02:56.885 --> 03:01.514
No.
Of course not.

03:01.723 --> 03:07.186
I call that sacrifice.
For the greater good.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.606
Open the door!

04:03.911 --> 04:06.829
Civilian check-in will
take place at 0900 hours.

04:07.039 --> 04:09.999
All civilians must be accounted
for by your station supervisor.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.420
There has to be
another way.

04:14.630 --> 04:15.922
There's not.

04:16.131 --> 04:17.673
Commander's message
was clear.

04:17.883 --> 04:19.008
Leave or die.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.801
We have 16 hours.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.345
You think we should
just give up?

04:22.554 --> 04:24.472
This is not our home.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.349
It's theirs.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.267
Because Kane went
looking for peace,

04:28.477 --> 04:31.062
he has given us
a chance to move on

04:31.271 --> 04:32.647
without bloodshed.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.523
And where's
Marcus now?

04:34.733 --> 04:36.108
In prison still?

04:36.318 --> 04:38.402
You're just gonna
leave him there?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.238
Like the kids
in Mount Weather.

04:40.447 --> 04:44.575
If we run, who's
gonna rescue them?

04:44.785 --> 04:47.870
You weren't there, Abby.
I saw them.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.956
Warriors trained
since childhood

04:50.165 --> 04:52.541
to fight and die
for their cause.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.461
And as we speak,
they are marching on this camp.

04:55.671 --> 04:56.879
And trust me
when I tell you

04:57.089 --> 04:58.589
the right choice
is to live

04:58.799 --> 05:01.259
so that we can come back
and fight another day.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.389
Ma'am, sir.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.848
The people are
on edge.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.100
A word from
their chancellor

05:09.309 --> 05:10.685
could go
a long way.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.478
- Of course.
- Unfortunately, sir,

05:12.688 --> 05:15.147
Dr. Griffin is
still in command.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.149
Until a vote
can be taken,

05:17.359 --> 05:19.527
or you willingly
transfer your authority.

05:23.532 --> 05:24.991
What are you
waiting for?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.659
I'm not ready to
march our people

05:26.868 --> 05:28.911
into the desert,
Thelonious.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.830
Not until we try
to find another way.

05:34.418 --> 05:35.793
We'll talk to them
together.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.145
Chancellor?

05:55.814 --> 05:57.523
Listen up.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.526
By now you've all
heard the rumor,

06:00.736 --> 06:02.945
and unfortunately,
it's true.

06:03.155 --> 06:04.530
The grounders are coming.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.534
We have a difficult
decision to make.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.578
Thankfully,
chancellor Jaha

06:10.787 --> 06:12.663
has found his way
back to us,

06:12.873 --> 06:14.790
and we're discussing
all options.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.085
But to be safe...

06:21.089 --> 06:23.424
You need to pack. Now.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.676
Whatever you can carry.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.845
We may need to leave
at a moment's notice.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.305
Where will we go?

06:29.514 --> 06:31.807
I don't know,
is the answer.

06:33.352 --> 06:35.478
But I heard
of a place.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.396
A city of light.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.357
It's across
the dead zone.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.067
What makes you think
we'll make it there?

06:41.276 --> 06:42.234
Because we
made it here.

06:43.862 --> 06:49.283
I have faith,
and right now,

06:49.493 --> 06:52.078
given
the alternative,

06:52.287 --> 06:53.579
that's good enough
for me.

06:55.207 --> 06:56.248
Not for us.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.336
If we leave here,
what happens to our

07:00.545 --> 07:01.796
people in
Mount Weather?

07:02.005 --> 07:02.963
As your mother said...

07:04.758 --> 07:06.675
That is a very difficult
decision to make.

07:08.804 --> 07:10.304
But the time has come

07:10.514 --> 07:12.807
for each and every one
of us to ask:

07:13.016 --> 07:16.102
Is this how the story
of our people ends?

07:18.313 --> 07:21.982
Did we come all this way
just to die tomorrow?

07:22.192 --> 07:23.651
Because if
we're not gone

07:23.860 --> 07:25.569
by the time
that sun rises,

07:25.779 --> 07:27.238
that is exactly
what will happen.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.539
No decision's been made.

07:36.748 --> 07:40.418
In the meantime, please report
to your station supervisor

07:40.627 --> 07:42.336
and gather emergency supplies.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.223
Hey, where have
you been?

07:54.433 --> 07:55.474
In the dropship.

07:55.684 --> 07:56.642
You need to come back
with me right now.

07:56.852 --> 07:57.643
Why? What's
happened?

07:57.853 --> 07:59.103
I'll explain
on the way.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.020
Bring a med kit.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.188
Meet me at
raven's gate.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.609
This is my fault.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.570
The grounders are
attacking because of me.

08:07.779 --> 08:08.904
The grounders
are attacking

08:09.114 --> 08:10.281
because that's
what they do.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.453
Go with Bellamy.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.163
Your mom said no decision
has been made.

08:17.372 --> 08:20.124
If that changes,
I'll let you know.

08:40.479 --> 08:42.354
It's OK.
It's OK.

08:42.564 --> 08:43.647
He's been
restrained.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.944
I can't believe we're
back here again.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.112
Can you help him?

08:53.700 --> 08:54.783
I don't know.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.707
I knew Mount Weather
controlled the reapers.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.213
I had no idea they were
creating them.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.508
If they can do that
to Lincoln...

09:10.717 --> 09:12.259
What are they doing
to our friends?

09:29.778 --> 09:32.488
I'm
tired of puking.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.782
I'm tired
of being a human pincushion.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.284
Look, I know
this sucks, but

09:37.494 --> 09:38.827
as long as it seems
like we're cooperating,

09:39.037 --> 09:40.621
we're buying
ourselves time.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.456
Time for what?

09:42.666 --> 09:43.999
I say if we're
gonna die in here,

09:44.209 --> 09:45.918
we might as well
die trying to escape.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.711
We've been over this.
After Clarke left,

09:47.921 --> 09:49.088
there is no escape.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.925
We just have to
hold on long enough

09:53.134 --> 09:54.468
for her to find a way
to get us out.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.095
What if she doesn't
find a way?

09:57.556 --> 09:59.098
What if she didn't
make it out?

09:59.307 --> 10:01.350
What if that's just
a story they're telling us

10:01.560 --> 10:02.893
to hide the fact
that they killed her?

10:04.354 --> 10:05.980
Then no one's
coming for us

10:06.189 --> 10:08.190
and we're doing exactly
what they want us to do.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.945
Jasper...You know
you've thought it, too.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.116
All right, then.
We escape.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.158
No.

10:19.536 --> 10:20.703
We find the truth.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.956
How do we do that?
We're criminals, right?

10:26.334 --> 10:27.626
So, let's be criminals.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.398
He's convulsing.

10:49.608 --> 10:50.608
So, what does
it mean?

10:54.988 --> 10:55.988
What happened
to his leg?

10:59.451 --> 11:00.367
I shot him.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.080
Clarke, he's lost
a lot of blood.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.804
Can you shine the light
on his neck?

11:25.769 --> 11:26.769
Needle marks.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.020
You think he's
been drugged?

11:28.229 --> 11:29.063
Maybe.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.149
Lincoln!

12:17.987 --> 12:20.072
Is it true?
We're evacuating?

12:20.281 --> 12:21.323
I just gave
the order.

12:21.533 --> 12:24.118
My son is still inside
that Mountain.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.661
David, I know,
and believe me,

12:25.870 --> 12:27.496
if there was any other way,
I would've taken it.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.124
But I swear to you,

12:30.333 --> 12:31.875
as soon as we find
someplace safe,

12:32.085 --> 12:33.168
we'll figure out
a way to get them.

12:33.378 --> 12:34.211
I'm not going anywhere.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.379
Yes, you are.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.339
The guard is leading
the evacuation.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.258
If you stay,
you'll be disobeying orders.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.843
Then order me
to stay.

12:41.052 --> 12:41.927
The other parents
with missing kids

12:42.137 --> 12:43.303
aren't going
anywhere, either.

12:43.513 --> 12:44.430
I can protect them.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.434
I'd be ordering
you to die.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.812
How is that gonna
help your son?

12:52.021 --> 12:52.980
Abby, please.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.608
You got your job back.

12:56.818 --> 12:58.318
Don't make me
abandon mine.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.577
Sergeant,
pack your things.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.036
Report to
major Byrne.

13:08.246 --> 13:09.747
The grounders
attack at dawn.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.457
I want every man,
woman, and child

13:11.666 --> 13:12.416
out of this camp
by then.

13:12.667 --> 13:13.500
Is that clear?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.336
Is that clear?

13:23.219 --> 13:24.803
Based on
these results,

13:25.013 --> 13:26.513
treatments with
the blood of the forty-seven

13:26.723 --> 13:29.683
will never be enough
to get us to the surface.

13:29.893 --> 13:32.144
Why are you
saying that like it's good news?

13:33.563 --> 13:35.773
Because it's
made me start over.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.441
If treatments
using their blood

13:37.650 --> 13:39.109
give us
temporary immunity,

13:39.319 --> 13:41.779
how do we extend that
immunity forever?

13:41.988 --> 13:44.573
By going to the source of
their blood.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.450
Bone marrow.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.661
What would happen
to the donors?

13:49.871 --> 13:53.165
There's 382 of us.
That's roughly

13:53.374 --> 13:55.334
8 procedures for
each of the kids.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.212
You didn't answer
my question.

13:59.881 --> 14:02.633
Everyone of the forty-seven
would die.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.095
He'll never
go for that.

14:07.305 --> 14:08.680
You have
to convince him.

14:08.890 --> 14:12.810
Cage...We could be
living on the ground

14:13.019 --> 14:14.311
within a month.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.270
All of us.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.772
If your theory
is correct.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.441
I'll worry about
the science.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.360
You worry about
your father.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.369
We have to stop the bleeding
and get the bullet out.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.370
Hold his leg down.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.544
Shh, shh.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.170
Rawr!
Aah!

14:44.884 --> 14:45.843
I'll get some more.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.767
O. Once the drug

14:53.977 --> 14:55.686
is out of his
system, he'll be OK.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.896
You can't protect me
from this one, big brother.

15:23.298 --> 15:26.884
Shh, shh, shh.

15:31.389 --> 15:34.141
Nyko. What are you
doing here?

15:34.350 --> 15:36.059
Our scouts have
already arrived.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.853
The commander is
true to her word.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.606
If you do not leave,
you will die.

15:40.815 --> 15:43.942
Octavia, you saved my
life from the reapers.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.277
Now let me save yours.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.279
It's what Lincoln
would have wanted.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.408
What was that?

15:51.618 --> 15:52.576
That was Lincoln.

16:00.543 --> 16:01.668
Your mom
would be proud.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.378
My mom would know
how to save him.

16:14.807 --> 16:15.974
Bellamy, don't.

16:16.184 --> 16:18.060
He's Lincoln's friend
and their healer.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.649
He's
seizing again.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.038
What is that?

16:53.554 --> 16:54.429
Wait!

16:55.848 --> 16:57.307
Back off.
Right now.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.769
Yu gonplel ste odon.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.647
It's what they say
before death.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.858
He's not trying
to heal him.

17:09.404 --> 17:10.320
He's trying
to kill him.

17:17.620 --> 17:21.289
Nyko? Is it true?

17:21.499 --> 17:23.667
Yes. Death is
the only way.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.085
Hold on.
There could be

17:25.294 --> 17:26.211
away
to bring him back.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.338
None that
I've ever seen.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.173
We have to go.
The camp's leaving.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.633
- You!
- We have to stop--

17:33.720 --> 17:36.388
get off him!
You slaughtered my people.

17:36.597 --> 17:39.599
Elders. Children.
Innocents.

17:39.809 --> 17:40.934
Nyko,
you're killing him.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.019
Blood must
have blood!

17:42.228 --> 17:43.228
Get out
of the way!

17:43.438 --> 17:45.355
Bellamy, you're not
shooting him! No!

17:47.775 --> 17:49.276
Aah!

17:58.619 --> 17:59.661
Lincoln.

18:02.457 --> 18:03.457
He's not breathing.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.004
His heart's stopped.
Move.

18:33.905 --> 18:34.905
He was dead.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.742
How did you do that?

18:38.951 --> 18:41.078
You've tried bringing
reapers back before?

18:43.748 --> 18:44.956
And they died like this?

18:49.378 --> 18:50.337
What is it?

18:53.091 --> 18:54.549
I know how to stop
the attack.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.311
He's stable for now.
We should go.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.481
You ready?

19:15.029 --> 19:16.655
Even if you can
save Lincoln...

19:18.199 --> 19:19.491
He won't
be the same.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.163
The things he's done...

19:28.292 --> 19:29.543
They'll stay with him.

19:31.879 --> 19:32.838
We don't know that.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.090
Yes, we do.

19:42.265 --> 19:43.682
Lincoln's savable...

19:46.394 --> 19:47.310
And so are you.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.110
Now, come on.
We have to hurry.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.711
Today, Monty.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.379
I'm going as fast
as I can.

20:19.594 --> 20:22.345
Relax. Maya's decontaminating the
surveillance room.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.471
No one's watching.

20:24.682 --> 20:25.599
We got this.

20:27.310 --> 20:28.810
If we can get
that door open.

20:33.608 --> 20:34.608
Ye of little faith.

20:34.817 --> 20:37.485
That's my boy.
Come on, let's move.

20:41.115 --> 20:42.282
Go, go, go,
go, go.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.919
Harper, watch
the hall.

20:54.128 --> 20:55.462
Why do I have to
watch the hall?

20:55.671 --> 20:58.006
Monty's good with computers.
Miller's a thief.

20:58.216 --> 20:59.341
Why can't you watch
the hall?

20:59.550 --> 21:01.426
I'm the mastermind.

21:01.636 --> 21:02.761
Just go watch the hall.
Come on.

21:10.561 --> 21:11.603
What do we have here?

21:17.109 --> 21:18.485
It's password protected.

21:21.322 --> 21:22.364
We'll see about that.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.202
And they said we
wouldn't amount to anything.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.666
Initiated
evacuation plan 2A.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.501
Report to your
station supervisor

21:34.710 --> 21:36.503
for further instruction.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.004
You made the right
decision, Abby.

21:41.425 --> 21:42.300
Mom.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.221
Where have you been?
We're leaving.

21:46.430 --> 21:47.180
I know how to stop
the attack.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.765
What are you
talking about?

21:48.975 --> 21:50.684
We haven't been able to negotiate
with the grounders

21:50.893 --> 21:52.852
because we haven't had
anything to offer them.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.605
The biggest threat they face
is from the reapers.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.482
I think we may be able
to eliminate that threat

21:57.692 --> 21:58.650
for them once and for all.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.112
How?

22:02.321 --> 22:04.072
Abby.
You can't serious--

22:23.342 --> 22:24.426
They're here.

22:35.604 --> 22:38.023
Initiated
evacuation plan 2A.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.942
Report to your station supervisor
for further instructions.

22:42.528 --> 22:43.862
They're
not attacking yet,

22:44.071 --> 22:45.613
which means we
still have time.

22:45.823 --> 22:47.240
We have two
hours till dawn.

22:47.450 --> 22:48.616
Let me talk
to the commander.

22:48.826 --> 22:50.994
She was Anya's second.
Maybe she'll listen.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.038
We don't even know if
the commander's here.

22:53.247 --> 22:55.457
Yes, we do.
Nyko told us.

22:55.666 --> 22:56.833
You have to at least
let her try.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.669
Abby, we're
wasting time.

23:01.005 --> 23:02.630
Give me
the authority now.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.841
Hold on. Clarke,

23:05.051 --> 23:05.800
you said
that Lincoln is

23:06.010 --> 23:07.260
going through
withdrawal.

23:07.470 --> 23:10.013
We don't even know what
he's withdrawing from.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.765
The detox alone
could kill him.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.058
That's where
you come in.

23:13.267 --> 23:14.559
And if I can't
save him?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.145
That's not an option.

23:20.149 --> 23:23.610
We are risking everything
on a bluff, Abby.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.320
We have an out.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.280
We have a way to save the lives
of our people.

23:27.490 --> 23:28.406
Not all of them.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.575
We will come back
to save the kids

23:30.785 --> 23:31.785
inside mount
weather.

23:31.994 --> 23:33.370
We all know that's
not gonna happen.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.413
Abby, this has gone
on long enough.

23:35.623 --> 23:37.374
If you do not give the order to
begin the exodus,

23:37.583 --> 23:38.708
you are killing
us all.

23:44.799 --> 23:45.924
I'm sorry.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.762
I can't give
that order.

23:56.060 --> 23:59.813
Abby...
Give the order.

24:03.776 --> 24:04.776
No.

24:07.238 --> 24:10.615
I...Am the elected

24:10.825 --> 24:12.075
chancellor of
the ark.

24:13.411 --> 24:14.661
And I am not gonna
let you risk

24:14.870 --> 24:15.620
the lives
of my people.

24:15.830 --> 24:16.704
Do you understand?

24:16.914 --> 24:19.249
I'm going to ask
you once again--

24:19.458 --> 24:22.961
give the order to
begin the exodus.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.505
No. Are you
through yet?

24:41.564 --> 24:42.522
Sergeant Miller?

24:44.442 --> 24:45.400
Major Byrne.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.696
I am relieving Dr. Griffin
of her command.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.952
Place these three
into custody

24:56.162 --> 24:57.579
but make sure that
they are ready

24:57.788 --> 24:59.247
to leave with
the rest of us

24:59.457 --> 25:00.415
within the hour.

25:02.418 --> 25:03.960
Right now!
Major,

25:04.170 --> 25:06.754
or the blood of everyone
in this camp

25:06.964 --> 25:08.006
will be on your
hands, too.

25:11.260 --> 25:14.637
Major Byrne,
sergeant Miller,

25:14.847 --> 25:17.015
put chancellor Jaha
in the stockade.

25:22.688 --> 25:23.605
Yes, ma'am.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.827
Everything we did
to survive...

25:41.081 --> 25:42.957
You're just throwing it
all away. Why?

25:44.793 --> 25:46.377
Because I have
faith, too.

25:49.173 --> 25:50.340
In my daughter.

25:58.015 --> 25:58.848
Thank you.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.939
I'll send a guard
detail with you.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.608
No. They'll see it
as a threat.

26:09.944 --> 26:11.528
I have to do this
on my own.

26:14.365 --> 26:15.990
Finn will take you
to Lincoln.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.325
If you're wrong...

26:20.579 --> 26:21.996
All of us
are gonna die.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.840
Yes.

26:37.638 --> 26:38.471
Guys.

26:40.391 --> 26:41.266
Ha!

26:43.811 --> 26:44.686
Wow.

26:58.409 --> 26:59.409
Hey, I got something.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.452
Me, too.
Damn, I'm good.

27:09.712 --> 27:10.837
They're alive.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.864
If you so much as
look at her the wrong way,

27:38.073 --> 27:39.157
I will slit
your throat.

28:03.307 --> 28:05.099
You're the one who burned

28:05.309 --> 28:08.895
300 of my warriors alive.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.022
You're the one who
sent them there to kill us.

28:15.944 --> 28:17.779
Do you have
an answer for me,

28:17.988 --> 28:19.322
Clarke of
the sky people?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.451
I've come to
make you an offer.

28:23.661 --> 28:25.286
This is not
a negotiation.

28:30.334 --> 28:32.001
I can help you beat
the Mountain men.

28:34.880 --> 28:35.838
Go on.

28:36.048 --> 28:36.923
Hundreds of your people

28:37.132 --> 28:38.633
are trapped inside
Mount Weather.

28:38.842 --> 28:41.552
Kept in cages.
Their blood is used as medicine.

28:41.762 --> 28:42.804
How do you know this?

28:43.013 --> 28:44.097
Because I saw them.

28:44.306 --> 28:46.099
My people are
prisoners there, too.

28:46.308 --> 28:47.225
I was one of them.

28:47.434 --> 28:50.436
Lies. No one escapes
the Mountain.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.980
I did.
With Anya.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.482
We fought our way
out together.

28:54.692 --> 28:56.901
Another lie.
Anya died in the fire.

28:57.111 --> 28:58.027
You killed her.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.084
She told me you were
her second.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.212
I'm sure she'd want
you to have this.

29:26.724 --> 29:28.182
We don't know it's hers.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.770
Anya was
my mentor,

29:32.980 --> 29:35.106
before I was called
to lead my people.

29:40.821 --> 29:41.904
Did she die well?

29:43.532 --> 29:47.368
Yes. By my side,

29:47.578 --> 29:49.328
trying to get
a message to you.

29:49.538 --> 29:50.997
What message?

29:51.206 --> 29:52.373
The only way to save
both our people

29:52.583 --> 29:53.791
is if we
join together.

29:54.001 --> 29:57.420
Those who are about to die
will say anything.

29:57.629 --> 30:01.215
I'm still waiting for
an offer, Clarke.

30:01.425 --> 30:03.885
The Mountain men
are turning your people into reapers.

30:05.596 --> 30:06.596
I can turn them back.

30:06.805 --> 30:07.638
Impossible.

30:10.559 --> 30:11.934
I've done it.
With Lincoln.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.061
That traitor
is the reason

30:14.271 --> 30:16.314
my village was slaughtered
by your people.

30:30.788 --> 30:32.872
You say you can turn
reapers back into men?

30:35.501 --> 30:36.876
Yes.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.169
Then prove it.

30:40.088 --> 30:41.255
Show me Lincoln.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.785
What are we doing
out here?

31:12.955 --> 31:14.497
I told you
to trust me.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.094
Son.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.436
It worked.

31:39.398 --> 31:40.773
It's OK.

31:40.983 --> 31:42.567
You got the same
treatment I did.

31:44.069 --> 31:44.944
Go ahead.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.056
I'd forgotten
the smells.

32:19.563 --> 32:20.813
This is where we belong.

32:29.072 --> 32:33.075
You always told me
that the surface

32:33.285 --> 32:34.744
was our true home.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.959
Not some
concrete coffin.

32:53.055 --> 32:54.096
We have to go
back now.

32:55.724 --> 32:56.933
We only have
a few minutes.

32:59.603 --> 33:00.436
Come on.

33:12.491 --> 33:13.616
Dad?

33:17.621 --> 33:19.330
Don't play
with me, son.

33:19.539 --> 33:20.831
What will it take
to stay?

33:23.293 --> 33:24.210
Bone marrow.

33:26.546 --> 33:27.672
All that they have.

33:29.049 --> 33:32.093
They'll die so that
we can finally live.

33:44.272 --> 33:45.773
This is
our world.

33:51.780 --> 33:52.989
We deserve this.

33:54.408 --> 33:56.492
We are the keepers
of history.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.619
What we've done
to the outsiders

33:58.829 --> 33:59.996
has corrupted
our legacy.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.331
I can't go down
that road any further.

34:06.336 --> 34:07.294
Dad.

34:09.423 --> 34:10.381
Dad.

34:13.468 --> 34:14.510
Please.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.137
The answer is no.

34:38.368 --> 34:40.745
Oh, thank God.
Where's Clarke?

34:41.997 --> 34:43.039
Trying to stop
a war.

34:56.678 --> 34:57.845
Pupils are
unresponsive.

34:59.556 --> 35:00.598
Tie off his arm.

35:00.807 --> 35:01.682
Tight as you can.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.234
Thanks to the supplies
your brother found,

35:12.444 --> 35:13.736
Lincoln might have
a chance.

35:13.945 --> 35:14.987
What's that?

35:15.197 --> 35:16.155
This will bring down
his fever.

35:20.410 --> 35:21.786
Hold him down!

35:33.590 --> 35:36.509
What's happening?
Why isn't it working?

35:36.718 --> 35:37.593
His heart stopped.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.110
You're their healer?

35:55.946 --> 35:57.279
Tilt his head back.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.406
Pull his chin down
to open his airway.

36:09.334 --> 36:10.251
Come on.

36:20.137 --> 36:21.011
This way.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.058
Come on.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.653
You're stopping.
What's wrong?

36:37.863 --> 36:38.821
I'm sorry.

36:43.743 --> 36:44.869
He's gone.

36:45.078 --> 36:47.830
No, it's not possible.
You're wrong!

36:48.039 --> 36:49.248
Octavia.

36:57.132 --> 36:58.090
Come back.

37:02.888 --> 37:03.762
Lincoln.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.214
I'll kill them all.

37:54.314 --> 37:57.608
Please. You don't
have to do this.

37:57.817 --> 37:58.776
You lied.

38:00.237 --> 38:01.612
And you're
out of time.

38:12.374 --> 38:13.457
Hit him again.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.266
Oh, Lincoln.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.979
Octavia.

39:04.884 --> 39:07.303
If Alpha's on the ground,
maybe other stations are, too.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.346
You're from
Alpha, right?

39:09.556 --> 39:10.764
My dad was chief guard.

39:12.267 --> 39:14.518
He sure loved having
a thief for a kid.

39:14.728 --> 39:17.354
Hey. You're
a great thief.

39:19.399 --> 39:22.067
These are the engineering
schematics for this whole place.

39:22.277 --> 39:25.154
If there's a way out,
we're gonna find it.

39:27.532 --> 39:28.490
Guys.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.411
Harper didn't show
for breakfast.

39:32.620 --> 39:33.370
You guys seen her?

39:33.580 --> 39:34.872
Not since
Dante's office.

39:37.334 --> 39:38.500
So, where the hell
is she?

39:42.839 --> 39:45.549
Please.
No. Please.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.385
Please.

39:48.595 --> 39:51.263
Don't worry.
This won't hurt.

39:52.807 --> 39:57.061
The hip has the largest
marrow pocket.

39:57.270 --> 39:59.104
We'll begin
the aspiration there.

39:59.314 --> 40:00.773
I don't need to know
the details.

40:00.982 --> 40:02.274
Just do it.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.279
Your father will
come around, Cage.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.075
What if he doesn't?

40:13.411 --> 40:14.578
I just want to go home.

40:16.706 --> 40:17.581
I know.

40:22.504 --> 40:23.337
So do we.

40:27.300 --> 40:30.177
I just
want to go--

41:13.680 --> 41:15.514
Lincoln's recovery
was...

41:17.475 --> 41:18.434
Impressive

41:21.729 --> 41:24.148
no one's ever survived such
a fate before.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.110
It's not complicated,
really.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.070
We just have to keep
them alive long enough

41:30.280 --> 41:31.780
for the drug to leave
their system.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.532
I know we can do
the same for others.

41:37.871 --> 41:39.204
You may have
your truce.

41:43.168 --> 41:44.418
Thank you.

41:44.627 --> 41:47.087
I just need one
thing in return.

41:47.297 --> 41:48.505
Tell me.

41:48.715 --> 41:50.674
Deliver me the one
you call Finn.

41:52.469 --> 41:56.054
Our truce begins...
With his death.
