ADULT ADAM:
<i> Ah, the last week of school.</i>

00:01.469 --> 00:03.969
<i> It's a truly magical feeling</i>
<i> of impending freedom</i>

00:03.971 --> 00:07.740
<i> as the entire student body</i>
<i> unites in not giving a crap.</i>

00:07.742 --> 00:10.075
<i> Even the teachers</i>
<i> were checked out.</i>

00:10.077 --> 00:11.577
All right,
stop your stretching.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.512
We're gonna watch
the movie <i> Bloodsport.</i>

00:13.514 --> 00:14.346
Not that I'm complaining,

00:14.348 --> 00:16.081
but isn't that, like,
wildly inappropriate

00:16.083 --> 00:17.816
and has nothing to do
with gym class?

00:17.818 --> 00:19.818
"Sports" are in the title.
Leave me alone.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.621
I got nothing left
to give you kids!

00:22.623 --> 00:23.522
You did this to me!

00:23.524 --> 00:24.857
ADULT ADAM:
<i> But for all us eighth graders,</i>

00:24.859 --> 00:27.026
<i> the last week of school</i>
<i> meant one thing.</i>

00:27.028 --> 00:28.727
All right,
boys and girls,

00:28.729 --> 00:31.430
today begins
Freshman Fear Week.

00:31.432 --> 00:32.364
(STUDENTS GASP)

00:32.366 --> 00:34.266
This is when upperclassmen

00:34.268 --> 00:37.469
hunt down terrified
incoming ninth graders

00:37.471 --> 00:38.837
and throw them in the showers.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.506
Did he say "hunt"?
Balls!

00:40.508 --> 00:42.041
No! I made it
through middle school

00:42.043 --> 00:43.242
without using
those showers!

00:43.244 --> 00:46.011
ADULT ADAM: <i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> school policy on cruel</i>
<i> hazing traditions...</i>

00:46.013 --> 00:48.347
(CHUCKLING) Oh, yeah.
<i> ...tended to be</i>
<i> a tad more lax.</i>

00:48.349 --> 00:49.948
I swear, one day,
they'll realize

00:49.950 --> 00:51.950
this whole practice
is completely barbaric.

00:51.952 --> 00:54.019
You will never live
to see that day!

00:54.021 --> 00:57.256
But you're my brother.
You're supposed to protect me.

00:57.258 --> 00:57.890
Opposite!

00:57.892 --> 01:00.459
I've been training for this
my whole life.

01:00.461 --> 01:03.695
Every headlock, noogie,
and wet willy

01:03.697 --> 01:04.530
has led to this moment.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.498
There has to be
a way out of this.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.068
There is,
but it's not pretty.

01:09.070 --> 01:11.470
Mama!
Barry's gonna hurt me!

01:11.472 --> 01:12.538
I'm here, schmoo.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.272
He's gonna hunt me down

01:13.274 --> 01:15.774
and throw me into
the gross gym showers!
No!

01:15.776 --> 01:16.308
Yes!
No!

01:16.310 --> 01:17.576
And then he's gonna
rip my shoes off

01:17.578 --> 01:19.511
and make me touch the floor
without flip-flops!

01:19.513 --> 01:22.381
You're not athletic enough
to get athlete's foot!

01:22.383 --> 01:23.348
Help me!
I'm just a boy!

01:23.350 --> 01:24.983
(GASPS)
I got you, baby.

01:24.985 --> 01:27.386
Oh, God!
No, I don't.

<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was June 2,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

01:42.369 --> 01:43.702
<i> the end of the school year,</i>

01:43.704 --> 01:46.638
<i> a moment that would live</i>
<i> in time forever.</i>

01:46.640 --> 01:47.139
Hey, guys.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.608
Still looking for
contributions for the
time capsule.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.411
So far, we've got
one Hall & Oates poster,

01:52.413 --> 01:52.978
put in by me.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.413
I'm gonna put in
a naked picture of myself

01:54.415 --> 01:58.050
so I can look back and say,
"Yeah, Naked Rob had it."

01:58.052 --> 01:59.852
I'm gonna put myself
in there.

01:59.854 --> 02:01.687
Boom!
Livin' in the future.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.890
Dude, it's a time capsule,
not a time machine.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.191
Right?

02:06.193 --> 02:06.825
You're funny

02:06.827 --> 02:10.662
and have trouble
making eye contact with girls.

02:10.664 --> 02:11.163
I like it.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.866
All except for the haircut
and the posture,
but I can fix that.

02:13.868 --> 02:16.502
Thanks, I think?
Hey, Erica!

02:16.504 --> 02:16.902
Oh!

02:16.904 --> 02:18.170
You want to sign
my yearbook?

02:18.172 --> 02:20.339
I saved you
precious real estate
right next to my face.

02:20.341 --> 02:20.772
Fine.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.407
Yeah, you know, if you need
some more time with it,

02:22.409 --> 02:23.375
you could just
give it back to me.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.077
Okay, you're done.
"Have a summer."

02:25.079 --> 02:27.179
Did you mean, like,
"good summer" or...

02:27.181 --> 02:30.449
Or "bitchin' summer" or...
Or "sexy summer"?

02:30.451 --> 02:32.151
Just "summer."

02:32.920 --> 02:35.454
Do you think she meant it
like "Have a summer"

02:35.456 --> 02:36.788
or "Have a summer"?

02:36.790 --> 02:38.257
Dude,
you got to let this go.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.159
Yeah,
don't be such a Duckie.
Such a what?

02:40.161 --> 02:42.961
Duckie, the twerpy,
lovesick best friend

02:42.963 --> 02:44.663

Please!

02:46.467 --> 02:47.633
If I'm anyone
from <i> Pretty in Pink,</i>

02:47.635 --> 02:49.401
it's feather-haired bad boy
James Spader.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.103
That is delusional.
Get to know yourself, bro.

02:51.105 --> 02:55.374
Geoffrey, Andrew, Robert,
I need to speak to my child.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.308
She's using
our proper first names.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.677
Move it.
It's scary
'cause she said "Andrew."

02:58.679 --> 02:59.778
What? I didn't even
do anything!

02:59.780 --> 03:03.448
Adam says you're gonna haze
and humiliate him at school?

03:03.450 --> 03:05.050
Oh, that.
Yeah, that's happening.

03:05.052 --> 03:05.984
Like heck it is!

03:05.986 --> 03:08.187
You lay one finger
on my baby...

03:08.189 --> 03:11.290
You mean the pubescent monster
standing next to you?

03:11.292 --> 03:14.293
Take a look at him, Ma.
He's all grown up now.

03:14.295 --> 03:18.063
That is not
the, uh...

03:18.065 --> 03:20.265
No, that's not...

03:22.436 --> 03:23.936
Is this true?

03:23.938 --> 03:25.938
No! Look at me!

03:25.940 --> 03:27.005
Actually, don't.

03:27.007 --> 03:30.175
Uh, close your eyes
and imagine me from last year.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.577
Oh, my God! He's right.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.478
My baby is going
to high school.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.348
No! Stop reeling
at the passage of time!

03:36.350 --> 03:37.282
Protect me!

03:37.284 --> 03:38.083
Your voice!

03:38.085 --> 03:40.452
I'm just now hearing it
for the first time.

03:40.454 --> 03:44.556
It's like the last gasp
of an old helium balloon.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.058
(SOFTLY) No.

03:46.060 --> 03:46.658
Oh, yes.

03:46.660 --> 03:50.662
I just broke Mom's spirit,
so now I can shower you.

03:50.664 --> 03:51.830
Get ready, bro.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.832
Shhhhhh!

03:53.968 --> 03:55.000
Why are you shushing me?

03:55.002 --> 03:57.102
That's not a shush.
That's a shower sound.

03:57.104 --> 04:00.205
What are you talking about?
This is a shower sound.

04:00.207 --> 04:00.872
Kwwwwwwwhhhhh!

That's the ocean, bro.
A shower sounds like this.

Shhhhhh!

04:04.745 --> 04:06.612
You're making a fool
out of yourself!

Listen to me. Listen.

Hello.

Do you mind closing the door,

Mur? Your wife is sitting
in the broom closet,

04:27.534 --> 04:28.667
sniffing a baby blanket.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.868
That's her thing.
She sits in there

04:29.870 --> 04:33.238
and sniffs them
to remind her of when
our children were babies

04:33.240 --> 04:34.306
and not the worst.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.107
And that doesn't bother you?

04:35.109 --> 04:37.576
What do I know?
I'm just the husband.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.578

Fine.

Bevy, I know it's hard with
Adam going into high school,

04:47.688 --> 04:51.256
but you can't hide here
in the closet forever.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.292
(SIGHS)
You're right.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.327
Just...
Just take this thing

04:55.329 --> 04:57.296
and put it where
I can never find it.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.363
It's time to let go.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.599
It doesn't appear
like you are.
I'm letting go.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.934
I shouldn't have to struggle
like this.

05:02.936 --> 05:03.769
Set me free.

05:03.771 --> 05:04.569
Al! Will you help me?

05:04.571 --> 05:06.505
She's got
superhuman strength!

05:06.507 --> 05:08.674
Take it!
I'm handing it over.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.443
She's got the forearms
of a tennis pro.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.544
Take the blankie.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.912
Put your back into it.

No, man!
I'm so wet, I'm so cold.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.523
They didn't even give me
a towel.

If they can throw Taz Money
in the showers,

05:26.393 --> 05:27.125

Oh, your Nana is
so sweet, but wrong.

If you're any Donnie,
you're Donny Osmond.

Clean and non-threatening.

You look insane.

a baby blanket,

You mean
that gross, blue rag

that smells like chickenpox
and nightmare sweat?

07:33.954 --> 07:37.656

But, yes, that's the one.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

and put it
in a time capsule.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.532
No! No, no, no, no, no!

07:47.534 --> 07:49.668
That blankie is
the only thing I have

07:49.670 --> 07:52.103
to remember
my favorite baby!

07:52.105 --> 07:53.505
First of all, ouch.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.407
But I think
this is a good thing.

07:55.409 --> 07:58.844
Your closet time is...
How do I put it?

07:58.846 --> 08:00.679
Sad and creepy.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.180
This will force you
to go cold turkey.

08:02.182 --> 08:05.784
Or I just dig it up
first thing in the morning!
No.

08:05.786 --> 08:06.518
Yes.
No way.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.919
All people will remember
all summer

08:07.921 --> 08:10.822
is my crazy mom digging up
the school's front lawn.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.891
Good idea.
You be my lookout.

08:12.893 --> 08:15.193
Don't even put that thought
in your mind.

08:15.195 --> 08:18.363
Too late.
Look in my eyes, Erica.

08:18.599 --> 08:19.631
It's locked in.

08:19.633 --> 08:20.799
Come on, I need you.

08:20.801 --> 08:24.336
If you do this,
I promise, next year,

08:24.338 --> 08:27.305
I will not go storming
down to the school.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.673
Seriously?
My whole senior year

08:28.675 --> 08:32.644
without my crazy mom
roaming the hallways
like a blond ghost?

08:32.646 --> 08:33.678
That's what I'm promising.

08:33.680 --> 08:34.746
We dig during first period,

08:34.748 --> 08:37.349
while everyone is
still half asleep in class.

08:37.351 --> 08:38.316
Understand?

08:38.318 --> 08:39.351
You have my word, boop.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.953
You will not humiliate me
more than normal.

08:41.955 --> 08:45.390
<i> ¶ We're gonna dig</i>
<i> to get the blankie</i>

08:45.392 --> 08:46.391
Okay, that's...
That's enough.

08:46.393 --> 08:50.362
<i> ¶ And I'm gonna sniff it</i>
<i> 'cause it's so snuggly ¶</i>

08:50.364 --> 08:52.964
You have
a serious problem.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.867
ADULT ADAM: <i> There were only</i>
<i> two days left until summer,</i>

08:55.869 --> 08:59.271
<i> and that meant one thing,</i>
<i> nobody cared.</i>

08:59.273 --> 09:02.807
Okay, your calculus teacher
called in sick.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.009
Wish I'd have thought of it.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.711
So we're gonna watch
a math-based movie,

09:06.713 --> 09:08.547
<i> Cannonball Run II.</i>

09:08.549 --> 09:09.481
How is that a math movie?

09:09.483 --> 09:12.851
"II." It's got a number
in it, math.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.086
BEVERLY:
Psst. Snuggy.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.454
(SIGHING) Oh.

09:16.456 --> 09:19.558
Mr. Coach Mellor,
can I go to the bathroom?

09:21.828 --> 09:22.727
(WHISPERING) Hey,

09:22.729 --> 09:25.063
why are you going to
the bathroom with a shovel?

09:25.065 --> 09:26.064
Oh, is this a lady thing?

09:26.066 --> 09:30.135
No. I got to dig up
the stupid time capsule.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.303
Oh, no.

09:31.305 --> 09:31.803
I'm boned.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.306
I stashed a tape
professing my love to Erica
in that time capsule

09:34.308 --> 09:36.374
so that our kids could hear it
30 years from now.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.609
Nice move, Duckie.

09:37.611 --> 09:38.910
I'm not Duckie!
It's romantic.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.912
I even serenade her
with the power ballad

09:40.914 --> 09:42.080
<i> Heat of the Moment</i>
by Asia.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.148
It's classic Duckie, bro.
Yeah.

09:43.150 --> 09:46.351
Aw, you're right!
I got to get that tape back.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.688
(BOTH GRUNTING)

09:49.690 --> 09:51.022
How are you so good
at this?

09:51.024 --> 09:53.124
Jazzercise
builds upper-body strength.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.426
Stop!
You can't dig that up!

09:54.428 --> 09:56.761
You stop! We have one minute
till the bell rings,

09:56.763 --> 09:58.029
and then
everyone will see us.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.864
Ooh! There!
I see shiny metal.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.533
We're one scoop away.
Wait, wait, wait!

10:01.535 --> 10:03.902
I'll help
so I can open it first!

10:04.071 --> 10:05.604
Uh, aah!
(CLANG)

10:05.606 --> 10:07.505
Oh! Oh!
(SCREAMING)

10:07.507 --> 10:08.340
D... Don't worry!

10:08.342 --> 10:10.809
I'll... I'll plug it
with my body!

10:11.144 --> 10:12.611
(SCREAMING)

10:12.613 --> 10:13.979
Erica, save me!

10:13.981 --> 10:14.679
Geoff!

10:14.681 --> 10:16.581
My tummy's drowning!

10:16.583 --> 10:17.382
Oh, my God!

10:17.384 --> 10:19.317
BALL:
Beverly Goldberg.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.319
My office, now!

10:21.321 --> 10:23.488
May I ask
what this is regarding?

10:23.490 --> 10:24.389
(GEOFF SCREAMING)

10:24.391 --> 10:27.425
ADULT ADAM: <i> As my mom</i>
<i> and sister were flooding</i>
<i> the front of the school,</i>

10:27.427 --> 10:31.496
<i> Barry was drowning</i>
<i> in embarrassment</i>
<i> from my epic body slam.</i>

10:31.498 --> 10:33.164
Hey, man,
how's your back?

10:33.166 --> 10:35.100
A little sore,
but I'm on the mend.

10:35.102 --> 10:35.734
Thanks for asking.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.936
That wasn't concern.
That was ridicule.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.805
Ha! You got flipped on
your ass like a turtle.

10:40.807 --> 10:41.406
(LAUGHS)

10:41.408 --> 10:44.609
JTP, I need your counsel
immediately.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.912
Um, is it cool
if we talk after school,

10:47.914 --> 10:49.748
or later this summer?

10:49.750 --> 10:50.382
Yeah, the thing is,

10:50.384 --> 10:52.651
you got body-slammed
by a middle schooler,

10:52.653 --> 10:54.919
which makes you
lower than a freshman now,

10:54.921 --> 10:57.322
so we have to
keep our distance.

10:57.324 --> 10:57.789
You get it.

10:57.791 --> 11:01.626
You guys can't blow me off.
I'm your leader. JTP!

11:05.098 --> 11:05.664
What the hell?

11:05.666 --> 11:07.799
You're supposed to
automatically repeat "JTP."

11:07.801 --> 11:10.368
Has the entire school
turned on me?

11:10.370 --> 11:11.202
We need to talk.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.771
Oh, God,
you're breaking up with me.

11:12.773 --> 11:13.905
No, of course not.
Yet.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.641
We just need to undo
what happened.
Right. Easy.

11:16.643 --> 11:17.976
So, just lure Adam
into a public space

11:17.978 --> 11:20.645
and dispense a swift beatdown
for all to see.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.180
Done.
Quick question.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.481
Is there anything else
I can do

11:23.483 --> 11:26.017
that doesn't require me
going near him?
Why?

11:26.019 --> 11:29.888
I'm, like...
How would you put it?

11:30.090 --> 11:32.123
Very afraid of him.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.124
Adam, your nerdy brother,

11:33.126 --> 11:36.027
who dives for cover
when someone pops a balloon?

11:36.029 --> 11:37.796
Correct.

11:38.131 --> 11:38.630
This is a lot.

11:38.632 --> 11:41.099
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As Barry was facing</i>
<i> his cold, dark future,</i>

11:41.101 --> 11:43.601
<i> my sister was feeling</i>
<i> the heat.</i>

11:43.603 --> 11:44.736
Congrats. Your little stunt

11:44.738 --> 11:48.106
broke the water line
leading to the locker room.

11:48.108 --> 11:52.043
You ruined
both Freshman Fear Week

11:52.045 --> 11:53.044
and a timeless tradition

11:53.046 --> 11:55.146
started by the great
William Penn himself,

11:55.148 --> 11:59.250
who, after he founded
this institution in 1689,

11:59.252 --> 12:02.687
immediately threw a freshman
into the showers!

12:02.689 --> 12:04.089
(CLEARS THROAT)

12:04.091 --> 12:07.225
Oh, yeah, and, uh,
there are some people

12:07.227 --> 12:10.829
who are also very upset
about their pet project.

12:10.831 --> 12:11.563
Yes, I am upset.

12:11.565 --> 12:15.033
Everything in the time capsule
was completely ruined.

12:15.035 --> 12:15.700
Yes!

12:15.702 --> 12:17.802
Oh, everything except
this one thing.

12:17.804 --> 12:18.269
No!

12:18.271 --> 12:20.505
We should throw that away
just to be fair.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.306
Oh, I think this is for you.

12:21.308 --> 12:26.311
"For future wife
Erica Schwartz.
Love, your future hubby"?

12:26.313 --> 12:27.579
Really, dude?

12:27.581 --> 12:28.179
Aww.
Awkward.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.915
Geoff, for the millionth time,
I don't like you that way,

12:30.917 --> 12:34.152
not now, not in the future,
not ever.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.087
So I really am the Duckie.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.089
The dork from
<i> Pretty in Pink?</i>

12:38.091 --> 12:42.327
Yes, that's a great example.
That's exactly who you are.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.429
I think Duckie's cute.

12:44.431 --> 12:44.929
Thanks.

12:44.931 --> 12:48.199
Okay, this conversation's
gotten away from me.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.334
Let's just wrap it up.

12:49.336 --> 12:52.036
Both of you
are suspended for the day.

12:52.038 --> 12:52.937
Called your parents.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.339
They're on their way
to pick you up.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.040
Message received.
Come on, schmoo.

12:56.042 --> 12:58.176
Buh-buh-buh-bip!
I called your husband.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.645
I'm suspending you
from parenting for the day.

13:00.647 --> 13:04.182
Nice try, but
Murray won't care
unless money's involved.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.251
Here's the bill.

13:06.453 --> 13:11.022
Are you kidding me?
600 bucks for a broken pipe?

13:11.024 --> 13:15.393
Well, the headline here is,
I saved Blankie.

13:15.395 --> 13:15.894
(CHUCKLES)

13:15.896 --> 13:18.596
Sure,
it's lost its Adam smell,
but I'll just recharge it.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.331
You can't recharge
a blanket.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.633
Ho-ho! You bet I can!

13:21.635 --> 13:23.802
I'll just sneak it
into his pillowcase

13:23.804 --> 13:25.737
or mix it in his hamper
like a stew.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.906
Don't do that.
Don't make a hamper stew.

13:27.908 --> 13:31.342
I just...
I need the blanket.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.211
Once they grow up,
it's all I'll have.

13:33.213 --> 13:36.414
Look, I know how hard
this is for you.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.048
I do.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.184
They're more than my world,
Murray.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.118
They're my life.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.621
If I'm not Mama,
what am I?

13:43.957 --> 13:44.923
Well, that's up to you.

13:44.925 --> 13:48.059
ADULT ADAM:
<i> While my mom had to figure out</i>
<i> her place in the world,</i>

13:48.061 --> 13:50.562
<i> I was loving my new life</i>
<i> as a cool kid.</i>

13:50.564 --> 13:52.096
ADAM:
<i> ¶ Gummi Bears</i>

13:52.098 --> 13:55.300
<i> ¶ Bouncing here and there</i>
<i> and everywhere</i>

13:55.302 --> 13:58.837
<i> ¶ High adventure</i>
<i> that's beyond compare</i>

13:58.839 --> 14:01.506
<i> ¶ They are the Gummi Bears ¶</i>

14:01.508 --> 14:03.374
Look at him
sitting there, Pops,

14:03.376 --> 14:05.844
acting like
a badass street punk.

14:05.846 --> 14:06.744
Adam?
Correct.

14:06.746 --> 14:09.080
With the cartoons
and the gelatin candies?

14:09.082 --> 14:11.883
He thinks he's bad?
Well, I'll show him who's bad.

14:11.885 --> 14:14.285
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.119
Why not?

14:15.121 --> 14:16.855
'Cause I'm enjoying
my leisure time.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.858
If I stand up,
you're gonna regret it.

14:19.860 --> 14:20.592
I can't live this way!

14:20.594 --> 14:23.428
You ruined my life
by fighting back and winning!

14:23.430 --> 14:24.629
Hey, I needed a win!

14:24.631 --> 14:28.299
Do you realize how crappy
this year has been for me?

14:28.301 --> 14:29.334
I lost my girlfriend,

14:29.336 --> 14:31.836
puberty was not kind
to my body,

14:31.838 --> 14:34.172
and I got pantsed
on the pull-up bar,

14:34.174 --> 14:34.772
undies and all!

14:34.774 --> 14:37.609
And then you tried to kick me
when I was down!

14:37.611 --> 14:40.078
No!
I was trying to help you!

14:40.080 --> 14:41.679
By throwing me
in the showers?

14:41.681 --> 14:42.347
Yes, idiot!

14:42.349 --> 14:44.582
Only the cool kids get hazed
during Fear Week.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.585
When I was your age,
no one picked on me,
and it sucked!

14:47.587 --> 14:50.388
I didn't want it to suck
for you, too!

14:50.824 --> 14:52.423
I didn't know that.

14:52.425 --> 14:56.561
Well, looks like next year
is gonna be awesome,

14:56.930 --> 14:59.197
for you, anyway.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.169
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It had been a day</i>

15:05.171 --> 15:07.305
<i> since I robbed Barry</i>
<i> of his pride and dignity.</i>

15:07.307 --> 15:08.840
<i> He was not taking it well.</i>

15:08.842 --> 15:12.010
Goodbye, nunchucks.
I will need you no more.

15:12.012 --> 15:15.046
Find a master
who's not a wussbag.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.482
<i> Arigato,</i> samurai sword.

15:17.484 --> 15:21.419
This is not a place of honor.
It's a place of shame.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.720
What did you
do to the boy?

15:22.722 --> 15:25.189
He's trying to murder
that garbage can.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.090
ADAM:
This isn't my fault.

15:26.092 --> 15:30.061
Did Barry seriously think
I'd be a nerdy little
brother forever?

15:30.063 --> 15:30.561
Actually, yes.

15:30.563 --> 15:33.598
Look at me.
I'm getting older and bigger.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.165
Things change.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.800
Well, no matter
how big you get,

15:35.802 --> 15:38.036
you're always gonna be
Barry's little brother,

15:38.038 --> 15:40.071
and that means a lot
to him.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.005
He sure
doesn't act like it.

15:41.007 --> 15:44.042
Trust me, he loves being
your big brother.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.544
It's a huge part
of who he is,

15:46.546 --> 15:51.215
and without that,
he's just not the same.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.985
Hey, Big Tasty,
we need to talk.

15:53.987 --> 15:54.953
Whatever!
Just stay away!

15:54.955 --> 15:56.054
Not that I'm scared
of you,

15:56.056 --> 15:58.056
but, please,
don't put hands on me.

15:58.058 --> 15:58.556
Come on, dude,

15:58.558 --> 16:01.659
we both know the only reason
I could body-slam you

16:01.661 --> 16:03.127
was the summer solstice.

16:03.129 --> 16:03.828
Summer what?

16:03.830 --> 16:05.330
You know,
the one day a year

16:05.332 --> 16:07.298
when the moon
is closest to the earth,

16:07.300 --> 16:09.133
which means
there's less gravity?

16:09.135 --> 16:10.001
There is?
Yes.

16:10.003 --> 16:13.805
That's how a nerd like me
suddenly had super strength.

16:13.807 --> 16:14.439
It's science.

16:14.441 --> 16:17.475
Science, you say?
Like the kind with scientists?

16:17.477 --> 16:18.109
Oh, sure!

16:18.111 --> 16:21.045
With white lab coats
and clipboards
and safety goggles.

16:21.047 --> 16:22.947
Beakers?
Tons of beakers, yeah.

16:22.949 --> 16:24.549
They hold them up the light
and nod?

16:24.551 --> 16:26.818
How else would they see
the chemicals?

16:26.820 --> 16:30.321
I knew there was no way
that happened for real!

16:30.323 --> 16:30.922
(CHUCKLES)

16:30.924 --> 16:33.825
So the balance of power
has been restored.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.193
You can be you again.

16:35.195 --> 16:35.927
It's not that easy!

16:35.929 --> 16:39.364
The whole school
witnessed this
once-in-a-lifetime moment.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.498
It can't be undone.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.167
Actually,
I think it can.

16:47.307 --> 16:50.274
Okay! Not that
complicated, people.

16:50.276 --> 16:51.576
I call your name,

16:51.578 --> 16:53.811
and then you go up
and get the piece of paper.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.948
But no showboating,
no speeches,

16:56.950 --> 16:58.883
and no doing the worm,
Dave Kim.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.184
I am onto you.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.185
This is America, man.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.488
BARRY: <i> Mic check,</i>

17:03.490 --> 17:05.023

17:05.025 --> 17:05.990
Checkity-check-check.

17:05.992 --> 17:08.593
Stop checking and just talk
before we get busted!

17:08.595 --> 17:10.995
<i> Attention,</i>
<i> William Penn Academy!</i>

17:10.997 --> 17:12.063
Prepare to bear witness

17:12.065 --> 17:15.066
to the most epic
Fear Week Prank of all time.

17:15.068 --> 17:19.037
Eighth graders,
welcome to high school.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.505
Go kick some ass.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.373
I'm back, baby.

17:24.144 --> 17:24.876
ADULT ADAM: <i> That day,</i>

17:24.878 --> 17:27.178
<i> I helped my brother</i>
<i> repair his damaged rep</i>

17:27.180 --> 17:28.046
<i> in one fell swoop.</i>

17:28.048 --> 17:30.114
No! This is my

17:37.123 --> 17:40.458
I'm not a freshman!
I'm the principal, damn it!

17:40.460 --> 17:42.960
It's not funny
when it happens to you!

17:42.962 --> 17:45.463
Dude, Goldberg just showered
the whole eighth grade!

17:45.465 --> 17:48.366
(LAUGHING) No way!
Legendary!

17:48.368 --> 17:49.300
Classic Tasty!

17:49.302 --> 17:50.468
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Growing up, we all have</i>

17:50.470 --> 17:52.303
<i> those magical moments</i>
<i> etched in stone.</i>

17:52.305 --> 17:55.506
<i> For Barry Norman Goldberg,</i>
<i> his moment was now.</i>

17:55.508 --> 17:57.842
Middle school's over,
losers!

17:57.844 --> 18:00.678
Oh, my God, he's right!
Middle school's over!

18:00.680 --> 18:04.048
<i> ¶ And we would scream</i>
<i> together songs unsung</i>
(CHEERING)

18:04.050 --> 18:06.918
I think next year's gonna be
pretty damn awesome.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.187
I'm happy for you.
For both of us.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.055
I'll make sure of it.

18:11.057 --> 18:13.024
But until then...

18:13.026 --> 18:13.925
Wait. What are you...

18:13.927 --> 18:15.426
<i> ¶ The heat of the moment ¶</i>

18:15.428 --> 18:17.428
(LAUGHING)
Yeah!

18:17.430 --> 18:18.429
JTP!

18:18.431 --> 18:19.664
ALL: JTP!

All of you!

18:26.406 --> 18:27.805
Let it happen, Earl.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.408
This prank
deserves our respect.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.209
Let it happen.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.044
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Turns out, Freshman Fear Week</i>

18:33.046 --> 18:34.712
<i> was one of the best</i>
<i> weeks of my life.</i>

18:34.714 --> 18:37.448
<i> We not only survived</i>
<i> the rite of passage,</i>

18:37.450 --> 18:39.617

18:44.557 --> 18:46.858
<i> ¶ Heat of the moment ¶</i>

18:46.860 --> 18:48.659
Guys, you've got to
hear this tape

18:48.661 --> 18:49.894
that Geoff Schwartz
made me.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.964
He, like, rambles on
about how special I am.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.432
Such a dork.

18:54.434 --> 18:55.333
Enough.
What?

18:55.335 --> 18:57.935
All year, you've been saying
you don't like the guy.

18:57.937 --> 18:58.936
That's 'cause I don't.

18:58.938 --> 18:59.937
(SCOFFS)
What?

18:59.939 --> 19:05.476
But I don't.
I don't like Geoff Schwartz.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.677
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It's crazy how sometimes</i>

19:06.679 --> 19:08.479

19:08.481 --> 19:11.315
<i> and all the things you were</i>

19:11.317 --> 19:14.118
<i> are suddenly staring you</i>
<i> right in the face.</i>

19:14.120 --> 19:16.921
Damn it, I like
stupid Geoff Schwartz.

19:16.923 --> 19:21.125
<i> And just like that, everything</i>
<i> suddenly falls into place...</i>

19:21.127 --> 19:22.393
Uh, Geoff, can we t...

19:22.395 --> 19:24.195
Come on, sweetie,
we got to get to Blockbuster.

<i> ...even if it's not the way</i>

19:27.033 --> 19:28.666
Hey, do you need something?

19:28.668 --> 19:29.901
It's... Nothing.

19:29.903 --> 19:34.772
<i> ¶ The heat of the moment</i>

Uh, have a great summer.

19:34.774 --> 19:35.940
Yeah, have a summer.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.975
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Yeah, growing up is tough...</i>

Oh, just look at him.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.210
We are gonna have
so much fun in high school.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.045
"We"?
You know, you were right.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.414
I do need a life
outside the house,

20:16.416 --> 20:20.084
and that is why I'm gonna get
my teaching certificate.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.485
What have you done,
Murray?

20:21.487 --> 20:23.154
ADULT ADAM:
<i> ...in more ways than one.</i>

20:23.156 --> 20:24.989
Oh, and I want this
to be a surprise,

20:24.991 --> 20:26.257
so don't tell the kids, okay?

20:26.259 --> 20:29.026
Don't worry, we'll let you
deliver that message.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.829
<i> That's the thing about</i>

20:31.831 --> 20:33.030
<i> Sure, we don't always remember</i>

<i> exactly who was there</i>
<i> or how it happened.</i>

(CHEERS AND LAUGHTER)

21:00.059 --> 21:00.825
Okay, as you know,

21:00.827 --> 21:04.028
you've been mocking
my changing voice
for this entire year.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.363
But now that I'm going
to high school,

21:05.365 --> 21:08.633
it's time for you to get out
all your insults here and now

21:08.635 --> 21:11.235
so we can bring this hurtful
chapter to a close.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.170
You sound like
a harmonica in a dryer.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.206
You sound like the child
of Louis Armstrong

21:15.208 --> 21:16.040
and Harvey Fierstein.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.743
You sound like the Tin Man
before he was oiled.

21:18.745 --> 21:21.112
You sound like a witch
gave a frog a voice.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.981
Stop it!
His voice is perfect.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.517
He sounds like
a beautiful angel...

21:26.519 --> 21:29.220
...with an undescended
testicle. (CHUCKLES)

21:29.222 --> 21:30.988
I regret this.
