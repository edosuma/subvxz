14:06.011 --> 14:06.929
He's my new partner.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.766
-You're a cop.
-Uh, detective.

14:10.849 --> 14:13.852
-Oh. That's much sexier.
-Much, much, much sexier.

14:13.936 --> 14:14.853
Mm-hm.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.650
-Can I buy you another drink?
-No, thank you.

14:19.733 --> 14:20.609
Nothing?

14:21.402 --> 14:22.278
No?

14:23.028 --> 14:23.904
Really?

14:25.155 --> 14:25.990
[blows air]

14:26.073 --> 14:26.907
Okay.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.244
[blusters]

14:30.661 --> 14:33.205
You know,
I know it's not any of my business,

14:33.289 --> 14:35.249
but how do you know him?

14:38.377 --> 14:40.754
Well, actually, we used to live together.
For years.

14:42.131 --> 14:42.965
Oh.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.385
This was a bad idea.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.679
-I think so.
-Yeah.

14:48.762 --> 14:49.722
Mr. Detective.

14:49.972 --> 14:50.931
Mm-hm.

14:51.765 --> 14:54.226
I actually have a real name.
It's Marco Diaz.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.396
I'm Meg. Rayburn.

14:58.898 --> 14:59.732
Rayburn?

15:02.318 --> 15:04.778
Are you his ex? Oh, no.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.530
[Meg laughing]

15:07.406 --> 15:08.908
What? Did I say something funny?

15:12.119 --> 15:12.953
What?

15:14.288 --> 15:17.499
-Did I say something funny?
-He doesn't have an ex. I'm his sister.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.170
-"Treat her nice."
-Come on. I'll buy you a drink.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.087
You deserve it.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.007
[Marco] All right.

15:34.391 --> 15:36.685
[John] I can't figure out
what you're doing, Roy.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.605
Trying to save Kevin from a murder charge.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.107
A simple "thank you" will do.

15:45.402 --> 15:49.365
-And what is it that you do for a living?
-I invest.

15:52.826 --> 15:53.661
In what?

15:56.121 --> 15:57.665
Are you a history guy, John?

15:58.999 --> 16:00.876
You think it bends towards justice?

16:01.585 --> 16:02.419
See, I don't.

16:03.587 --> 16:07.216
World War II, we set Tokyo on fire.

16:07.299 --> 16:10.052
Millions of dead civilians.
Was that justice?

16:10.636 --> 16:12.596
No, history's written by the winners.

16:13.806 --> 16:17.643
And I favor anything
that tilts the scales in my direction.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.813
That's what I invest in.
That's why I want you to be sheriff.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.732
But Kevin killing a cop?

16:23.816 --> 16:25.067
[chuckles]

16:25.734 --> 16:26.902
That wouldn't be helpful.

16:33.617 --> 16:34.660
And Eric O'Bannon?

16:35.202 --> 16:36.870
My guys will take care of it.

16:38.872 --> 16:39.873
Don't touch O'Bannon.

16:40.541 --> 16:45.921
Yeah, I intend to control history, John,
not be a victim to it.

16:46.255 --> 16:49.299
And you'd better decide
which side of that divide you're on.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.846
Don't touch O'Bannon for 24 hours.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.931
Give me a chance to get ahead of things.

17:36.889 --> 17:37.723
Hey, Raul.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.021
I'm so sorry.

17:52.446 --> 17:53.280
You broke him.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.532
You know that?

17:56.325 --> 17:57.242
You broke his heart.

17:58.827 --> 18:03.040
The one thing my baby brother could never
get over was you cheating on him.

18:06.293 --> 18:07.294
You don't belong here.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.298
Go try and relieve your guilt
somewhere else.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.680
Fuck it. You want--?
You wanna help my family?

18:20.766 --> 18:22.851
They won't let the priest in
to do last rites.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.062
-Who won't?
-The cops, the medical examiner,

18:25.145 --> 18:26.522
I don't fucking know.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.232
I'll talk to John.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.154
Raul, I know what you think about me.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.198
And maybe it's--

18:38.158 --> 18:40.494
It's too late now,
but I want you to know that...

18:41.829 --> 18:43.163
I know you were right.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.918
I was never good enough for your brother.

18:50.337 --> 18:55.551
You're gonna have to be vigilant now
about what you say and who you say it to.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.678
I'm in a lot of pain.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.513
Stay off the morphine.

18:59.596 --> 19:01.974
We don't want you saying things
you'll regret later.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.936
Mr. Gilbert, I'm so grateful
for what you did for me.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.146
[door opens]

19:08.605 --> 19:11.900
-Oh. Hi, Mr. Gilbert. Hi.
-Now, Roy, please.

19:11.984 --> 19:12.985
Hello, Belle.

19:14.194 --> 19:17.447
Oh, I, uh... I brought these.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.909
-Oh. Oh, they look delicious.
-Wait. Here's the thing.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.204
You can have one, but they're not
for family, they're for the nurses.

19:24.288 --> 19:28.083
That way they'll be here all the time,
and Kevin will get extra attention.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.210
-Little trick I learned.
-Thank you.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.253
Yeah.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.504
[Kevin grunts]

19:34.173 --> 19:35.549
[panting]

19:36.466 --> 19:41.180
He's trying not to do the morphine drip.
You know, AA and all.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.390
[Gilbert] I called
a specialist in from Miami.

19:43.473 --> 19:46.059
I wanna make sure my partner
gets the best care.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.315
-Thank you.
-Hey. Come on. It's all gonna be okay.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.446
[chickens clucking]

20:09.791 --> 20:12.085
[woman speaking indistinctly on TV]

20:12.419 --> 20:13.420
[knock on door]

20:22.429 --> 20:24.056
-Hi.
-Can I come in?

20:30.812 --> 20:32.814
[Chelsea] What the fuck
is wrong with our families?

20:34.107 --> 20:36.068
We just can't get out of each other's way?

20:39.613 --> 20:40.489
You mind?

20:41.573 --> 20:42.449
No.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.123
Where is he?

20:51.959 --> 20:53.085
You asking as a cop?

20:54.336 --> 20:55.212
As a friend.

20:55.545 --> 20:56.421
Where is he?

21:02.719 --> 21:04.763
Your brother's a suspect in the murder...

21:05.889 --> 21:07.307
of a police officer.

21:09.643 --> 21:10.602
My fucking partner.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.815
And I guarantee when they find him,

21:14.898 --> 21:16.817
they're not gonna ask questions first.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.610
You think he did it?

21:21.446 --> 21:22.489
Kevin says he did.

21:26.034 --> 21:26.910
Last night...

21:28.829 --> 21:30.289
my mother ran out of oxygen.

21:30.372 --> 21:33.000
He just left her lying there, suffocating.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.710
She could've fucking died.

21:35.335 --> 21:37.838
So, right now, I don't give a shit
what happens to him.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.134
Is she all right?

21:42.676 --> 21:44.594
No, she's worse than ever. It's real bad.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.098
I'm sorry to hear that.

21:56.606 --> 21:58.150
I'm thinking he went south.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.195
Down towards Marathon.

22:05.073 --> 22:05.949
The mangroves?

22:07.034 --> 22:08.410
Eric fucking hates Marathon.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.913
Him and Dan
used to get in fights down there.

22:17.878 --> 22:18.920
He probably went north.

22:23.008 --> 22:23.842
Okay.

22:30.849 --> 22:31.725
Thanks.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.480
John, I'm sorry about Marco.

22:38.523 --> 22:39.399
And Kevin.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.987
Shit, I'm sorry about everything.

22:46.907 --> 22:47.783
Me, too.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.294
I wanted to see how the hero was doing.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.881
Oh, no, I'm no hero.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.008
That's not what the news says.

23:05.592 --> 23:06.802
Front page headlines.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.095
How you feeling?

23:09.179 --> 23:10.722
Yeah, lot of pain.

23:11.723 --> 23:12.974
Hey, I read your statement.

23:13.433 --> 23:14.768
All the details.

23:15.268 --> 23:16.228
It's helpful.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.396
I just told them what I knew.

23:18.980 --> 23:19.856
Yeah.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.445
-Do you mind if I get one of these?
-Yeah, go ahead.

23:31.660 --> 23:32.619
Mmm.

23:36.456 --> 23:38.166
So, you were close with Marco, huh?

23:38.792 --> 23:41.670
Well, I mean, he was my sister's ex,
so, yeah, we--

23:43.088 --> 23:44.256
We knew each other, yeah.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.133
Yeah, I was just wondering

23:46.216 --> 23:48.260
why were you at his place
that late at night?

23:48.844 --> 23:50.011
I already explained that.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.514
Right. You said that he called you.

23:54.516 --> 23:55.475
Yeah, that's right.

23:56.184 --> 23:58.728
He said he wanted to talk to me.

24:00.188 --> 24:01.314
It seemed important.

24:02.190 --> 24:03.650
Oh, these are-- These are good.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.403
And you walked there?

24:07.904 --> 24:10.824
Yeah. I-- I can't drive 'cause of the DUI.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.033
Got it. Yeah.

24:12.659 --> 24:16.329
So, Marco called and said, "Come over."
Hmm?

24:17.831 --> 24:19.291
-Yeah.
-He didn't say why?

24:20.792 --> 24:24.129
That's-- That's already in the statement.
He just said it was important.

24:25.422 --> 24:26.298
Okay.

24:26.965 --> 24:29.467
Because in your statement you said
it seemed important.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.596
You didn't say that Marco actually said
that it was important.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.848
Look, the whole night was kind of a blur.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.058
-And--
-Yeah, you know, I know. I know.

24:37.475 --> 24:38.351
I know it was.

24:39.227 --> 24:41.813
And your statement
has so many useful details, you know?

24:42.147 --> 24:43.106
Specific.

24:43.648 --> 24:44.941
It was really helpful to me.

24:45.025 --> 24:48.570
He said it was important.
It's-- He definitely said it.

24:48.820 --> 24:51.198
I got it. I'll make a note in the file.

24:53.450 --> 24:57.078
And when you got to Marco's house,
you said you heard arguing?

24:57.162 --> 24:59.664
-Yeah.
-Marco and Eric O'Bannon?

24:59.748 --> 25:01.583
-You saw through the window?
-Yeah.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.669
-Did you hear what they said?
-No, I couldn't make out the words.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.715
[Kevin exhales audibly]

25:08.965 --> 25:11.301
It all happened really fast, you know?
I couldn't--

25:12.302 --> 25:14.221
[groaning] I couldn't hear
what they were saying.

25:15.430 --> 25:18.558
-You want me to call the nurse?
-Yeah. Thanks. I don't feel so good.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.269
Okay. Listen,
you take care of yourself, okay?

25:21.353 --> 25:22.312
All right.

25:22.395 --> 25:23.271
Okay.

25:24.439 --> 25:27.025
I'll have them send up those newspapers.
It'll make you feel better.

25:27.108 --> 25:27.984
Okay.

25:30.111 --> 25:32.906
[door opens then closes]

25:32.989 --> 25:34.074
[blusters]

25:42.415 --> 25:43.458
[sighs]

25:44.084 --> 25:44.918
[door opens]

25:45.835 --> 25:49.714
You said that Marco turned away

25:49.798 --> 25:52.842
and that O'Bannon hit him from behind

25:53.468 --> 25:55.262
-with some sort of sculpture.
-Yeah.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.473
Did you see
what he did with it afterwards?

25:58.556 --> 26:01.309
-Uh, no. Maybe he took it.
-Did you see him do that?

26:02.560 --> 26:03.645
No, I was shot.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.272
I got it.

26:05.355 --> 26:06.314
Good.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.440
Thank you so much.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.151
Hey, look, do you--?

26:10.777 --> 26:13.238
-Yeah, go ahead.
-Yeah, I just wanted to try

26:13.321 --> 26:15.115
the, uh, lemon poppy.

26:16.866 --> 26:17.826
[sighs]

26:18.326 --> 26:19.202
Take care.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.999
[Kevin sighs] Fucking hell, man.

26:24.082 --> 26:25.166
[remote beeping]

26:25.250 --> 26:26.710
[hospital bed whirring]

26:32.674 --> 26:34.301
[exhales deeply]

26:37.429 --> 26:38.930
[Meg] I was at the Diazes' today.

26:40.515 --> 26:42.934
I need you to do me a favor.
You have to make a call.

26:43.018 --> 26:46.104
Some asshole at the morgue
won't let the priest in to see the body.

26:47.522 --> 26:48.398
Yeah, I'll do that.

26:51.568 --> 26:52.444
Was Mom there?

26:54.946 --> 26:56.072
She made ceviche.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.244
One foot in front of the other.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.463
You told her everything.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.965
Come on, it was all gonna come out, John.
Marco knew.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.053
I couldn't lie anymore.

27:20.263 --> 27:22.515
You drove Kevin over to Marco's.

27:24.934 --> 27:27.020
Let's you and I
be really clear on something.

27:28.396 --> 27:30.315
I know what you and Kevin were planning.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.025
I know.

27:33.860 --> 27:37.572
I completely understand why it is that
you two would wanna protect yourselves.

27:39.866 --> 27:40.784
I really do.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.541
-What about Eric?
-They'll find him soon enough.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.960
They'll really pin
the whole thing on him?

27:51.544 --> 27:53.338
-How much does he know?
-Too much.

27:53.421 --> 27:54.255
Oh, fuck.

27:54.339 --> 27:56.508
Listen, I'll get to him
and make this work out.

27:56.591 --> 27:58.927
How? How are you gonna do that, John?

27:59.010 --> 28:01.930
Eric and Danny, they used to go down
to mile marker 100 or so.

28:02.013 --> 28:03.390
They used to go out in the mangroves.

28:03.473 --> 28:05.308
They used to go out there and party.

28:05.392 --> 28:08.520
Off of Dusenbury Creek.
Some shack or something.

28:09.771 --> 28:10.939
I'm gonna need your help.

28:14.943 --> 28:15.819
Okay.

28:17.028 --> 28:18.238
I'll be in touch with you.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.407
Hey, where were you last night?

28:21.449 --> 28:22.784
I called you a million times.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.539
Just went for a drive to clear my head.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.918
Maybe you should've kept driving.

28:41.010 --> 28:42.387
A Cohiba.

28:42.470 --> 28:43.430
Nothing like it.

28:44.013 --> 28:45.265
The Doble Robusto.

28:46.015 --> 28:47.600
From Fidel's private stock.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.645
So, how can we help each other?

28:51.146 --> 28:53.398
Well, the Castros are finished.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.525
Cuba is opening.

28:56.317 --> 28:59.738
US companies are investing.
This is a new market.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.657
But we need product.

29:03.241 --> 29:04.075
How much?

29:04.409 --> 29:05.952
[Esteban] The demand will be high.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.428
[Jim] Gilbert told me to meet you.

29:30.351 --> 29:31.311
How's your brother?

29:31.394 --> 29:32.562
Fuck you.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.356
Look, man,
I'm sorry about what happened, okay?

29:35.857 --> 29:39.527
You know, he gets kind of nervous
and he moved when he shouldn't have moved.

29:43.531 --> 29:44.949
You gonna make me ask for it?

29:45.033 --> 29:46.910
I don't want you
to think that's the kind of thing--

29:46.993 --> 29:48.328
I don't think anything.

29:48.411 --> 29:49.913
Why don't you just hand it over?

29:50.830 --> 29:52.791
It's 'cause I owe Gilbert, all right?

29:56.377 --> 29:57.712
Get the fuck out of my car.

30:00.006 --> 30:00.882
Wait a second.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.183
Diazes need access to the body tonight.

30:10.934 --> 30:12.018
Do that?

30:13.311 --> 30:16.231
-I can make that work.
-Okay, now get the fuck out of the car.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.407
[Esteban] What about security?

30:26.991 --> 30:30.829
You've always been an importer,
but this is something new.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.081
We can ensure our end.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.167
We've been in business for years.

30:37.752 --> 30:40.672
Question is... yours.

30:41.464 --> 30:42.757
Money can buy loyalty.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.970
And if that doesn't work,
there's other ways.

30:48.054 --> 30:49.264
Yeah, trust.

30:50.139 --> 30:52.058
It's hard to come by and easy to lose.

30:54.143 --> 30:55.019
We'll go slowly.

30:55.812 --> 30:56.896
[door opens]

30:56.980 --> 30:59.816
Hey, Sally.
You should go home and get some rest.

31:00.441 --> 31:02.026
-Is he awake?
-I think he's out.

31:02.110 --> 31:05.321
There's nothing for you to do right now.
I'm gonna stay here tonight.

31:05.405 --> 31:07.407
Oh, honey, you can't stay here.

31:07.490 --> 31:08.700
Where are you gonna sleep?

31:08.783 --> 31:11.452
-They set up a cot for me in Kevin's room.
-That's great.

31:11.536 --> 31:12.579
That's good, honey.

31:12.787 --> 31:14.122
Roy arranged it.

31:19.419 --> 31:20.295
Roy?

31:20.712 --> 31:22.297
He's been so great.

31:22.380 --> 31:25.008
He even paid for a specialist
to come in from Miami.

31:26.551 --> 31:27.427
Really?

31:27.719 --> 31:29.804
-You're old friends, aren't you?
-No.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.180
No, we just--

31:32.348 --> 31:34.183
We just knew each other a long time ago.

31:36.227 --> 31:37.645
He's been so good to us.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.194
He's not who you think he is, Belle.

31:46.905 --> 31:47.780
What do you mean?

31:48.489 --> 31:49.490
I'm just telling you.

31:50.950 --> 31:51.826
Be careful.

31:52.201 --> 31:55.872
Well, all I know is that he helped Kevin
when no one else would.

31:56.706 --> 31:57.790
We were going under.

31:57.874 --> 32:01.419
We-- We were about to lose the boatyard
and Roy stepped up.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.380
He really believes in Kevin.

32:04.464 --> 32:06.215
He really has faith in him.

32:07.550 --> 32:10.178
And that-- That's what Kevin needs.

32:12.639 --> 32:13.932
[sighs] Well...

32:14.849 --> 32:16.476
-I'll be back in the morning.
-Okay.

32:16.809 --> 32:17.769
You get some rest.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.062
Good night.

32:23.316 --> 32:25.026
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

32:25.610 --> 32:28.947
My brother was a good Catholic.
This should have been done last night.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.198
I'm sure you're upset,

32:30.281 --> 32:33.743
but this is an open murder investigation
and we have certain protocols.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.085
Meg...

32:42.710 --> 32:43.711
wanna come join us?

33:43.855 --> 33:44.981
Ready?

33:54.866 --> 33:56.451
[Marco] You ever think about going away?

33:57.160 --> 33:58.494
[Meg] Yeah, I've thought about it.

33:59.245 --> 34:00.288
I always come back.

34:02.373 --> 34:04.333
Well, I know a way
where you could leave...

34:06.085 --> 34:06.961
but not leave.

34:08.671 --> 34:09.547
Is that a riddle?

34:10.631 --> 34:11.507
No.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.135
You can marry me.

34:21.768 --> 34:25.521
[Sturgess] In the name of the Father
and of the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen.

34:41.370 --> 34:43.081
You have done well for yourself, Roy.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.458
Ah, things broke in my favor.

34:47.376 --> 34:48.836
Big house for one person.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.421
Yeah. It suits me.

34:51.714 --> 34:52.799
I can see that.

34:54.008 --> 34:56.511
I didn't want the encumbrances
that come with family.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.222
You probably know something about that.

35:00.181 --> 35:01.057
Drink?

35:01.557 --> 35:02.767
I'm not staying that long.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.394
Vodka, if I remember.

35:06.813 --> 35:08.481
I asked for your help, Roy.

35:08.564 --> 35:10.566
I didn't ask you to shoot my son.

35:11.609 --> 35:12.777
Ah.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.948
No good deed goes unpunished.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.367
-Don't be an asshole.
-[glass shatters]

35:20.368 --> 35:21.494
You almost killed him.

35:22.995 --> 35:25.581
You asked for my help, Sally.
I gave it to you.

35:25.665 --> 35:27.583
Come on, Roy.
I know you better than that.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.795
Robert dies, you buy into the boatyard,

35:30.878 --> 35:32.588
you're John's biggest campaign donor,

35:32.672 --> 35:36.217
-you give Meg legal work?
-Most people would thank me.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.052
Most people don't know you like I do.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.639
Are you threatening me, Sally?

35:42.515 --> 35:43.850
Because if it weren't for me,

35:43.933 --> 35:46.561
you and Robert
would have been sharecroppers somewhere.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.396
You stay away from my family.

35:48.896 --> 35:50.731
Right now
we're kind of in it together.

35:51.274 --> 35:52.483
Sell me the boatyard.

35:52.567 --> 35:55.153
Now, even if I was inclined, and I'm not,

35:55.236 --> 35:56.612
that's really up to Kevin.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.573
Kevin will do what I tell him.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.908
That's been Kevin's problem,
don't you think?

36:01.492 --> 36:04.287
You-- You jealous fuck.

36:05.288 --> 36:07.331
You've always wanted what Robert had.

36:08.207 --> 36:12.420
Well, you can't have it, Roy.
I'll see you dead before that happens.

36:55.296 --> 36:56.255
[Kevin] Meg.

36:57.256 --> 36:59.217
Hello, sister of mine.

37:00.259 --> 37:01.093
Hi.

37:03.387 --> 37:05.389
Fuck, this morphine is awesome.

37:05.473 --> 37:06.599
[chuckles]

37:08.059 --> 37:09.602
You should try this shit.

37:11.437 --> 37:12.813
You don't feel nothing.

37:17.568 --> 37:18.945
Why weren't you here?

37:22.073 --> 37:23.658
I don't know, I've been busy, Kev.

37:24.867 --> 37:26.744
I was at the Diazes',

37:28.204 --> 37:29.580
helping them plan a funeral,

37:29.705 --> 37:31.832
and then I went to the morgue,

37:32.959 --> 37:34.043
and I saw Marco.

37:36.545 --> 37:38.047
And I saw what you did to him.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.426
No, that--

37:44.512 --> 37:46.222
That was just an accident.

37:49.642 --> 37:51.018
His head was crushed.

37:53.020 --> 37:55.398
You must've hit him over,

37:55.940 --> 37:58.401
and over and over.

37:58.484 --> 37:59.360
No, Meg.

37:59.902 --> 38:00.903
He knew.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.658
He knew everything.

38:06.784 --> 38:09.203
I didn't have... a choice

38:16.502 --> 38:17.795
You and me, Kevin...

38:23.134 --> 38:23.968
we're done.

38:26.053 --> 38:26.887
You and me...

38:28.848 --> 38:30.599
no more going along with the ride.

38:30.683 --> 38:31.559
What do you mean?

38:32.935 --> 38:34.145
What are you gonna do?

38:36.147 --> 38:37.273
[yells]

38:38.566 --> 38:39.942
[groaning]

38:41.736 --> 38:42.611
You're on your own.

38:43.237 --> 38:44.155
Fuck you!

38:46.324 --> 38:47.533
[groans]

39:12.099 --> 39:12.933
[John] Hey, Eric.

39:13.976 --> 39:15.061
[Eric] Yeah.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.316
[John] Hey, asshole.

39:21.067 --> 39:22.068
-Easy, easy.
-[Eric] Fuck!

39:22.151 --> 39:24.028
-I'm here by myself.
-Get out of here!

39:24.111 --> 39:25.905
-I just wanna talk.
-Get the fuck out!

39:25.988 --> 39:28.282
I know you're scared,
but if they find you here,

39:28.366 --> 39:30.534
-you know what's gonna happen?
-I didn't kill Marco.

39:30.618 --> 39:31.577
Listen to me.

39:32.119 --> 39:33.245
Listen really closely.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.666
-We've got a witness that saw you there--
-No.

39:37.750 --> 39:41.045
He was dead when I got there, John,
I didn't do that to him.

39:41.754 --> 39:44.173
I believe you. I don't think
you could've done that--

39:44.256 --> 39:45.883
What the fuck are you doing here?

39:46.133 --> 39:48.469
Did you come to finish
what you started last night?

39:50.137 --> 39:50.971
Huh?

39:51.847 --> 39:54.058
You don't have much time.

39:54.558 --> 39:55.768
Now, I'm just here--

39:56.352 --> 39:58.771
I'm just here to give you
the opportunity...

40:00.189 --> 40:01.607
to protect yourself.

40:01.690 --> 40:02.691
Easy.

40:09.448 --> 40:10.282
Easy.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.044
Huh.

40:27.216 --> 40:28.384
Is it loaded?

40:32.263 --> 40:33.097
Huh?

40:35.933 --> 40:36.767
[clicks]

40:40.563 --> 40:41.689
It's too bad.

40:42.398 --> 40:43.232
Fuck you.

40:46.026 --> 40:48.320
Marco's head was smashed to shit.

40:49.405 --> 40:50.281
Did you do that?

40:52.408 --> 40:54.702
Fuck you, he was my goddamn partner.

40:55.202 --> 40:56.370
Then who the fuck did?

40:57.329 --> 40:58.330
Huh?

40:59.165 --> 41:01.125
I had fucking immunity, John.

41:02.501 --> 41:04.253
Now I'm living like an animal here.

41:04.336 --> 41:05.838
Eric, I'm really sorry.

41:13.554 --> 41:15.931
There's some money, clothes,
and a few other things.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.018
How the fuck did you find this place?

41:20.436 --> 41:23.647
I have only ever been here... once.

41:26.108 --> 41:27.026
Fucking Danny.

41:28.944 --> 41:30.029
Fucking Danny.

41:44.251 --> 41:45.252
Good luck, Eric.

42:28.128 --> 42:29.380
It's not gonna stop.

42:30.297 --> 42:31.423
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:32.007 --> 42:33.425
What's not gonna stop?

42:34.218 --> 42:35.135
The water.

42:35.427 --> 42:36.470
The sea level's rising.

42:36.554 --> 42:40.558
I read in the paper that we're all
gonna be underwater in 25 years.

42:40.724 --> 42:41.809
Well, me...

42:42.309 --> 42:43.686
I'll be underground.

42:46.105 --> 42:48.899
God, I still can't believe
what's happened.

42:50.693 --> 42:51.777
You need anything?

42:53.445 --> 42:54.280
No.

42:54.822 --> 42:55.656
I'm okay.

43:09.795 --> 43:10.838
Ms. Rayburn.

43:11.797 --> 43:13.257
We're praying for your brother.

43:16.135 --> 43:17.094
Thank you, Manny.

43:19.179 --> 43:21.140
Listen, I'd like to take the Sunfish out.

43:22.182 --> 43:24.685
You know what you're doing?
You want me to go with you?

43:26.520 --> 43:27.688
No, I'll be fine.

43:50.544 --> 43:52.463
You really think
Eric O'Bannon did this?

43:53.213 --> 43:54.298
That's what they say.

43:59.470 --> 44:00.304
I--

44:02.848 --> 44:04.683
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I gotta get going.

44:04.767 --> 44:07.603
Listen, I'll try and stop by the hospital
later tonight, okay?

44:08.812 --> 44:10.397
Call me if you need anything.

44:17.237 --> 44:19.448
[church bells ringing]

44:35.923 --> 44:37.091
Tell me who I could help.

44:38.634 --> 44:39.468
[Sally] I'd--

44:41.011 --> 44:41.845
I'd like to--

44:46.392 --> 44:47.476
To confess.

44:54.274 --> 44:57.319
[distorted chattering]

45:13.836 --> 45:14.711
Good afternoon.

45:16.713 --> 45:18.382
Hey, I really recommend the oysters.

45:38.610 --> 45:41.363
-You wanted to talk to me?
-Yeah, come on in. Shut the door.

45:43.949 --> 45:46.618
I wanted to tell you this myself,
that we got O'Bannon.

45:47.703 --> 45:49.621
-How?
-Somebody called it in.

45:49.872 --> 45:53.375
He was on the move in the mangroves,
and one of our boats spotted him.

45:54.710 --> 45:56.837
He had some interesting stuff with him.

45:57.921 --> 45:58.964
Interesting stuff?

45:59.381 --> 46:00.466
He had Marco's gun.

46:01.717 --> 46:03.051
The one that shot Kevin.

46:04.803 --> 46:06.388
And there's something else.

46:06.472 --> 46:08.891
O'Bannon had some
of your brother's things.

46:09.766 --> 46:10.726
Kevin's?

46:10.809 --> 46:11.685
Danny's.

46:15.189 --> 46:16.190
This looks familiar?

46:18.317 --> 46:20.444
Danny's initials are engraved on it.

46:25.491 --> 46:26.825
Dad gave him this.

46:28.160 --> 46:30.245
How do you think O'Bannon
got possession of it?

46:30.329 --> 46:31.413
Think he stole it?

46:32.581 --> 46:36.919
'Cause, you know, Marco floated a theory
that O'Bannon killed Danny.

46:40.672 --> 46:42.591
Yeah, it could give us motive.

46:43.175 --> 46:44.635
Marco confronts Eric,

46:44.801 --> 46:46.386
tells him he's gonna bring him in.

46:47.554 --> 46:48.388
They argue.

46:49.306 --> 46:50.682
Eric hits Marco,

46:51.308 --> 46:53.977
then shoots your brother
when he stumbles onto it.

46:56.188 --> 46:58.357
It's just that it's
just a little too neat.

47:00.108 --> 47:01.193
You know what I mean?

47:03.028 --> 47:04.530
'Cause the last time I spoke to Marco,

47:04.613 --> 47:07.658
he didn't think that O'Bannon
was Danny's killer.

47:08.534 --> 47:09.743
So, when did that change?

47:11.537 --> 47:14.748
And why would Marco
confront him at his house?

47:15.582 --> 47:17.125
That is so weird, right?

47:21.213 --> 47:25.050
Yeah, I-- I-- I don't know
what to think anymore, Franco.

47:25.133 --> 47:25.968
I, uh...

47:32.474 --> 47:35.644
You know, O'Bannon also had
a pretty wild story about you.

47:40.607 --> 47:41.525
About me?

47:42.401 --> 47:44.653
He said you planted the gun
on him last night.

47:45.362 --> 47:47.239
And the backpack with Danny's shit.

47:49.157 --> 47:50.492
That's a hell of a story.

47:50.784 --> 47:51.660
That's what I said.

47:52.244 --> 47:55.122
Because your sister told me
that you had too much to drink,

47:55.205 --> 47:56.373
and you stayed there.

48:02.588 --> 48:03.922
You were checking up on me?

48:06.466 --> 48:07.467
Come on, John.

48:09.803 --> 48:11.221
We were trying to find you.

48:11.888 --> 48:13.932
[phone ringing nearby]

48:15.642 --> 48:17.060
[ringing reverberates]

48:20.272 --> 48:21.940
But like I said,
it was a wild story.

48:23.233 --> 48:25.277
The DA's charging O'Bannon.

48:26.486 --> 48:29.364
I hope this gives your family
some closure, John.

48:38.957 --> 48:40.667
Thank you for keeping me in the loop.

48:41.251 --> 48:42.586
[softly] Okay.

49:12.157 --> 49:13.742
[line ringing]

49:16.745 --> 49:17.871
[Meg] Hello.

49:18.538 --> 49:19.706
You did good.

49:23.919 --> 49:24.961
Did I?

50:01.373 --> 50:04.584
[Marco] Well, I know a way where
you could leave but not leave.

50:05.085 --> 50:06.336
You can marry me.

50:07.796 --> 50:10.507
-I'm not saying no.
-Hey.

50:11.091 --> 50:13.760
But... I think we should take it slow.

50:15.303 --> 50:16.888
We have all the time in the world.
