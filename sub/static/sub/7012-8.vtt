- Oh, Wanda.
- Oh, Derek.

00:20.353 --> 00:23.789
- Oh, Wanda.
- Yes, Derek?

00:23.857 --> 00:26.849
You're not just
my next-door neighbor.

00:26.926 --> 00:29.793
You're also
the love of my life.

00:29.863 --> 00:34.061
Derek, I, too, have strong
feelings of love for you...

00:36.102 --> 00:39.469
but I have to give back
this promise ball and chain.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.905
I must leave
Point Upon the Place...

00:41.975 --> 00:45.775
and explore the world
with my trusty cat named Sir Bonkers.

00:46.846 --> 00:49.076
No.

00:49.149 --> 00:52.141
- I'll never let you go.
- <i>( Thunderclap )</i>

00:53.153 --> 00:56.418
- You can't make me stay.
- Oh, no?

00:56.489 --> 00:59.424
What if I told you that I've run over
the cat named Sir Bonkers...

00:59.492 --> 01:01.619
and the cat named
Sir Bonkers is no more?

01:01.694 --> 01:04.492
Now submit
and be my wife!

<i>( Thunderclap )</i>

01:06.566 --> 01:10.332
Derek, once you were
a kind, peaceful man...

01:10.403 --> 01:13.201
but love
has made you wicked.

01:14.674 --> 01:16.972
Oh, I am wicked.

01:17.043 --> 01:19.534
And until you agree
to be my wife...

01:19.612 --> 01:22.979
I will scour the earth
in search of cats named ''Sir Bonkers''...

01:23.049 --> 01:24.983
and I will kill
them all!

01:25.051 --> 01:27.349
Or at very least,
spray them with water...

01:27.420 --> 01:29.615

they hate.

I can't believe Donna would
publish this in the school paper.

01:42.836 --> 01:46.738
I know. This could be in <i>Reader's Digest.</i>
It's that good.

01:49.142 --> 01:53.306

an ex-girlfriend in a school newspaper ever.

02:39.726 --> 02:42.024
I know.
How could Donna write this?

02:42.095 --> 02:46.031
Why are you upset?
It's this Derek guy who really gets the shaft.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.025
Fez, I am Derek.

02:50.103 --> 02:53.038
Everything always
has to be about you.

02:54.374 --> 02:56.308
Fez, man, think about it.

Eric killed Donna's cat.
Derek killed Wanda's cat.

Hey, you guys, you know what goes
really good with a bad short story?

03:12.659 --> 03:14.593
Pinball!

03:14.661 --> 03:18.995
- No. I hate pinball.
- Hate it or love it?

03:19.065 --> 03:22.899
- Hate it.
- Or love it?

03:24.871 --> 03:27.806
Come on, guys. I'm gonna buy a
50-dollar stake in this machine...

03:27.874 --> 03:30.035
so let's play
so I can make some money.

03:30.109 --> 03:32.270
Where'd you get $50?

03:32.345 --> 03:35.041
- From Jackie.
- Hey.

03:35.114 --> 03:38.106
Oh, hey,Jackie.
Can I borrow $50?

03:38.184 --> 03:41.381
- For what?
- To buy a dress for you.

03:41.454 --> 03:43.945
Okay.

03:45.992 --> 03:47.926
Wait a minute.

03:47.994 --> 03:50.588

Bob really wants us to meet
his new lady friend.

04:13.953 --> 04:16.216
Now, think about it,
Kitty.

04:16.289 --> 04:19.281
She likes Bob.

04:21.661 --> 04:25.427
I have a hard time believing
this woman even exists.

04:25.498 --> 04:29.332
We're gonna get over there,
Bob's gonna be sittin' in a rocker...

04:29.402 --> 04:31.393

tonight, Bob.''

04:36.542 --> 04:39.340
''So do you, Bob.''

04:39.412 --> 04:42.904
You've been working on that
all day, haven't you?

04:44.350 --> 04:46.284
Yeah.

04:47.920 --> 04:52.857
Red, Kitty, I'd like you to meet
a very special lady-Joanne.

04:52.925 --> 04:55.792
Well,Joanne,
it is so nice to meet you.

04:55.862 --> 04:58.456
- Right, Red?
- We can't stay long.

04:59.999 --> 05:03.799
Ah, Red. Bob warned me
you can be a pain in the ass.

05:03.870 --> 05:07.397
( Laughing )

05:07.473 --> 05:09.873
( Bob Laughing )

05:09.942 --> 05:12.137
Well, I'll tell you what.
We'll just have dinner...

05:12.211 --> 05:15.476
and if it turns out you don't like me,
we'll never invite you over again.

05:15.548 --> 05:18.574
Really?
I like you already.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.581
Well, let's get this barbecue started.
Bob, grab that meat.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.285
Oh, I got it, Red.
Why don't you fellas make a salad?

05:27.360 --> 05:30.659
( Laughs )
Salad.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.225
Oh, you're serious.

05:35.301 --> 05:39.397
No, see, Bob and I
do the grilling.

05:39.472 --> 05:42.805
Not this time.
Kitty, you wanna give me a hand?

05:42.875 --> 05:45.776
- Well, I'd love to.
- Oh, I don't think-

05:45.845 --> 05:49.542
But, Kitty, you might...

05:49.615 --> 05:52.914
set your lovely hair
on fire.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.255
Well, it can't be that hard.
You do it.

06:06.699 --> 06:10.226
Bob, what the hell's
goin' on here?

06:10.303 --> 06:12.294
Look, Red,
I really like this woman...

06:12.372 --> 06:14.363
so please, for today,
just shut it.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.465
Shut it?

06:16.542 --> 06:19.636
Good God, Bob!

06:19.712 --> 06:23.705
Is she teaching you
to stand up for yourself?

06:25.251 --> 06:28.914
- Yes.
- Well, cut it out!

06:28.988 --> 06:32.981
I want to have a nice time.
Come on.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.653
I'll give you first dibs
on the aprons.

06:35.728 --> 06:40.131
You want the fake tuxedo
or the fake hairy chest?

06:42.502 --> 06:46.939
Oh, damn it.
Give me the tuxedo!

06:47.006 --> 06:51.340
Whoo-hoo! Hairy chest is Joanne's favorite.
( Laughs )

06:51.411 --> 06:54.380
It's probably
'cause she's got one.

07:02.922 --> 07:07.086
Ah! Well, if it isn't
the wielder of the poison pen.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.254
- Didn't you like my story?
- No. No, I didn't.

07:10.329 --> 07:12.559
That's why I said
''poison pen''...

07:12.632 --> 07:16.796
not... ''marshmallow pen.''

07:16.869 --> 07:18.803
( Laughs )
What?

07:18.871 --> 07:21.772
- This story is about us.
- No, it's not.

07:21.841 --> 07:24.776
You took stuff from our life
and put 'em in your story.

07:24.844 --> 07:28.371

07:41.060 --> 07:44.086
Derek, look what I found
under your bed.

07:44.163 --> 07:47.064
Lewd renderings of
naked serving wenches.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.067
Did you commission these?

07:49.135 --> 07:52.104
So what if I did?
I have needs, woman.

07:52.171 --> 07:55.800
Now, ready thyself.
On this night... we fornicate.

07:57.443 --> 08:00.469
Okay, well, maybe there
are some similarities.

08:00.546 --> 08:03.674
But that's what writers do.
I mean, we take stuff from our lives.

08:03.749 --> 08:07.913
Yeah, but you made me mean all the time,
and that's mean.

08:07.987 --> 08:11.047
Okay, maybe I exaggerated
some stuff...

08:11.123 --> 08:14.456
'cause, you know,
I'm writing this for stupid high school girls.

08:14.527 --> 08:18.088
Oh, my God!
Great story!

08:20.867 --> 08:25.236
<i>( Man Singing Rock )</i>

08:27.073 --> 08:31.874
Michael, Steven just told me
that instead of buying me a dress...

08:31.944 --> 08:35.903
you spent my $50
on this stupid machine.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.212
Jackie, I did not.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.808
Oh, yeah, I did.
( Laughs )

08:42.388 --> 08:45.687
Jackie, listen.
There's an old saying:

08:45.758 --> 08:50.195
You buy a girl a dress,
and she looks pretty for one night.

08:50.263 --> 08:54.893
But you buy her boyfriend a pinball machine,
and she looks pretty for life.

08:56.802 --> 08:59.202
Okay, there's another
old saying, Michael:

08:59.272 --> 09:02.332
You're dumb as dirt.

09:02.408 --> 09:04.706
That's true.
That was in the yearbook.

09:04.777 --> 09:07.678
Okay, okay. All right.
Listen, listen.

09:07.747 --> 09:10.944
So, I bought a half stake
in this machine, all right?

09:11.017 --> 09:14.646
So that means for every quarter
I put into it, I get half back.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.689
That's a 50% profit!

09:17.757 --> 09:22.251
Uh, actually, Kelso,
I think that's a 50% loss.

09:22.328 --> 09:26.662
Fez, I know it's hard
for a foreigner...

09:27.900 --> 09:31.961
to understand our complicated
capitalist system.

09:32.038 --> 09:36.031
But we're dealing with quarters here,
not frogs or chickens.

09:41.447 --> 09:45.474
Well, I'm not going to dignify
that with a response...

09:47.019 --> 09:49.112
because I can't
think of one.

09:50.923 --> 09:54.586
But when I do,
a good day to you.

09:54.660 --> 09:58.323
- All right, Fez. Y-
- I said, kiss my ass.

10:04.837 --> 10:07.237
So, you still mad?

10:07.306 --> 10:09.797
No. No reason to be mad.

10:09.875 --> 10:14.175
Your story is just a pathetic attempt to
rewrite history and make yourself look good.

10:14.246 --> 10:17.010
I'm pretty sure everyone's gonna know
who the dill-hole is here.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.745
Eric, it's just a story.

10:19.819 --> 10:22.515
No one's gonna think
anybody's a dill-hole.

10:23.856 --> 10:26.154
- Cat killer!
- Bastard!

10:27.760 --> 10:29.887
- Porn freak!
- ( Scoffs )

10:31.797 --> 10:34.357
Okay, they could be
talking about anybody.

10:34.433 --> 10:37.163
Hey, we're all
porn-freak bastards...

10:37.236 --> 10:39.796
but he's the only one
who killed a cat.

10:41.874 --> 10:46.607
Okay, okay. This school obviously needs
to hear the Eric Forman version of things...

10:46.679 --> 10:49.546
A.K.A. the truth.

10:49.615 --> 10:53.381
So I'm gonna write my own story.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

10:53.452 --> 10:55.545
I'm throwing down
the gauntlet, baby.

10:55.621 --> 11:00.581
Really? Okay, smarty,
what's a gauntlet?

11:00.660 --> 11:03.288
A gauntlet?
What's a gauntlet?

11:05.197 --> 11:08.564
( Snickers )
What's a gauntlet?

11:09.702 --> 11:12.637
I don't know,
but it's down, lady.

11:15.307 --> 11:19.437
- Boy, this chicken's delish. What a chef.
- ( Laughs )

11:19.512 --> 11:22.811
You really know your way
around a grill,Joanne.

11:22.882 --> 11:25.009
Mine's dry.

11:26.419 --> 11:29.513
No, it isn't.
It's tender and delicious.

11:29.588 --> 11:32.785
Maybe if I chewed it
with some water.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.292
Well, there's the hose.

11:40.099 --> 11:43.535
- I don't like her anymore.
- Well, I do.

11:43.602 --> 11:47.504
Kitty, I'm chopping vegetables...

11:47.573 --> 11:49.803
Bob's telling me to shut it...

11:49.875 --> 11:54.335
you're over there grilling
with Susan B. damn Anthony.

11:54.413 --> 11:56.938
Well, fine, Red.
If it bothers you...

11:57.016 --> 11:59.985
we can invite them over,
and you can do the grilling.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.112
But for now, I'd really appreciate it
if you'd just shut it.

12:05.191 --> 12:07.421
If one more person
tells me to shut it-

12:07.493 --> 12:10.621
What? You might
actually shut it?

12:20.573 --> 12:24.509
Please, Wanda, you don't
have to boil me alive.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.171
Killing your cat was
just a horrible accident.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.545
I know, but I'm a witch.

12:32.017 --> 12:36.681
Dear God, why is a nice,
sensitive guy like me...

12:36.756 --> 12:40.715
dating a lying,
manipulative witch like you?

12:40.793 --> 12:45.093
Well, maybe it's because
even witches have itches.

12:49.969 --> 12:52.233
All is forgiven!

12:58.377 --> 13:01.141
God, why do all my
stories end like that?

13:01.213 --> 13:04.546
Don't stop. I like
where you were going.

13:12.657 --> 13:15.251
All right, guys. It is time
to make a withdrawal...

13:15.326 --> 13:18.124
from the First National
Bank of Pinball.

13:25.370 --> 13:28.066
Oh, man.
No one's playing.

13:28.139 --> 13:33.076
Well, I would've played, but my frogs
and chickens wouldn't fit into the slot.

13:37.148 --> 13:39.708
All right. I know
what the problem is here.

13:39.784 --> 13:43.447
This thing has been here for so long
that people have forgotten about it.

13:43.521 --> 13:47.548
I just need to advertise. So,Jackie, put on
a bikini and stand in front of the machine.

13:49.160 --> 13:52.960
Michael, I am not wearing a bikini in here.
It would cause a riot.

13:54.198 --> 13:56.632
Okay, what if I just
put up flyers...

13:56.701 --> 13:58.760
with a picture
of you in a bikini?

14:00.471 --> 14:02.962
Yeah, okay. I mean,
it'll still draw a crowd...

14:03.041 --> 14:05.168
but at least
they'll remain orderly.

14:05.243 --> 14:08.474
Okay, so I just need some Magic Markers
and a picture of you in a bikini.

14:08.546 --> 14:11.014
Oh. I have one.

14:14.685 --> 14:17.119
Keep it.
I have plenty.

14:20.191 --> 14:22.125
So, guys,
check out my story.

14:22.193 --> 14:24.923
I passed out a bunch of copies
at lunch today.

14:24.996 --> 14:27.794
Oh, Forman, this kind of thing
always blows up in your face.

14:27.865 --> 14:30.663
Don't ever stop doing it.

14:32.904 --> 14:34.997
What the hell is this?

14:35.073 --> 14:38.839
Oh, you-
you didn't like my story?

14:38.910 --> 14:42.402
Oh, yeah, I loved it.
Especially this part.

14:44.415 --> 14:49.318
Wanda, I have performed
every task thou hath asketh of me.

14:50.555 --> 14:55.049
Please, can we finally
consummate our love?

14:55.126 --> 14:57.060
I beseech you.

14:57.128 --> 15:01.064
Well, I said I would.
So I won't.

15:01.132 --> 15:05.034
But... I beseeched you.

15:05.103 --> 15:06.798
Okay, let's consummate.

15:06.871 --> 15:09.066
- Really?
- No.

15:09.140 --> 15:12.769
Please.
I beseech you.

15:12.844 --> 15:14.778
- Okay.
- Really?

15:14.846 --> 15:16.939
No.

15:17.014 --> 15:19.244
Now rub my enormous feet.

15:23.054 --> 15:26.717
<i>Um, guys, I don't understand.</i>
<i>What does ''consummate''mean?</i>

15:27.992 --> 15:30.756
It means to have sex.

15:30.828 --> 15:32.819
Really?

15:33.931 --> 15:36.092
Now I have
two words for that.

15:37.135 --> 15:39.330
Eric, you just
wrote this to hurt me.

15:39.403 --> 15:43.362
What? I did not!
And, hey, so did you.

15:43.441 --> 15:48.105
Look, when I wrote my story,
I just sat down, and that's what came out.

15:48.179 --> 15:50.409
I didn't, like,
plan it or anything.

15:50.481 --> 15:52.415
And besides-
No, you know what?

15:52.483 --> 15:54.678
I don't have to explain
myself to you.

15:54.752 --> 15:57.915
<i>( Door Opens, Closes )</i>

15:57.989 --> 16:01.755
Okay, I'd like someone
to explain it to me.

16:01.826 --> 16:04.454
Uh, well,
that's easy, Fez.

16:04.529 --> 16:07.623
See, Donna,
as an artist...

16:07.698 --> 16:10.428
wrote her story to get
some perspective on her life.

16:10.501 --> 16:13.664
Forman,
as a vindictive ass...

16:13.738 --> 16:16.673
wrote his story
to be a vindictive ass.

16:18.276 --> 16:23.680
Oh, Eric, I think you just
consummated yourself.

16:31.822 --> 16:34.723
See what I did there?
Looks easy, but it's not.

16:37.762 --> 16:40.890
Well, steaks
are a-cookin'.

16:42.366 --> 16:47.861
Ah, what should we have
to go with dinner?

16:47.939 --> 16:51.636
Oh, I know.
How about a salad?

16:53.911 --> 16:56.539
Say,Joanne, why don't you
make the salad?

16:56.614 --> 16:58.809
- No, thanks.
- <i>Oh.</i>

17:00.184 --> 17:02.618
Aww.

17:02.687 --> 17:04.678
Make the salad.

17:05.756 --> 17:08.656
Unless you don't like
to do lady jobs.

17:08.726 --> 17:11.718
Red, put this
in your mouth.

17:13.097 --> 17:15.724
Okay, you know what?
I'll make the salad. Heh!

17:15.800 --> 17:17.768
- Sit down, Bob.
- Sit down, Bob.

17:21.638 --> 17:24.233
- I'd love to make a salad.
- Great.

17:24.308 --> 17:26.970
As soon as Red admits he's not
asking me to make a salad...

17:27.044 --> 17:29.569
he's trying to put me
in my place.

17:30.815 --> 17:33.409
You are woman.
I hear you roar.

17:36.921 --> 17:40.982
I can't believe you're so threatened
by something as trivial as me grilling chicken.

17:41.058 --> 17:45.586
It's not trivial.
Men grill.

17:45.663 --> 17:49.190
It's been that way
since the first caveman...

17:49.267 --> 17:52.464
bonked a woolly mammoth
on the head...

17:52.536 --> 17:55.027
and threw it
on the barbecue.

17:55.106 --> 17:58.371
And his cave wife
made the salad.

18:00.945 --> 18:04.403
- I smell something burning.
- Oh, darn!

18:13.057 --> 18:16.891
Well, if you didn't want it well done,
you should've said something.

18:19.363 --> 18:21.797
What the hell!

18:21.866 --> 18:24.596
Where's my pinball machine?

18:25.836 --> 18:28.566
Oh, where, indeed?

18:28.639 --> 18:31.403
( Laughing )
I remember.

18:31.475 --> 18:35.536
I convinced the owner that pinball was out,
and Space Invaders was in.

18:35.613 --> 18:38.844
Fez, why would you stab me
in the back like that?

18:38.916 --> 18:44.445
Well, rest assured, Kelso, your frogs and
chickens comment had nothing to do with it.

18:44.522 --> 18:46.922
Well, why then?

18:54.332 --> 18:58.996
Hey, Eric, we're sorry we called you
a cat-killer bastard porn freak.

18:59.070 --> 19:02.130
Oh, so, you read
my story, huh?

19:02.206 --> 19:04.265
No, we read part two
of Donna's story.

19:04.342 --> 19:06.310
The ending
is so beautiful.

19:06.377 --> 19:09.244
Part- Huh?

19:09.313 --> 19:12.043
Beauti-What?

19:14.085 --> 19:16.781
''And as Wanda walked away,
she knew in her heart...

19:16.854 --> 19:19.345
she would never
stop loving Derek.''

19:19.423 --> 19:22.119
Wow,
that's good writing.

19:22.193 --> 19:25.560
It's emotional,
and it screws you.

19:33.504 --> 19:35.438
Hey.

19:36.507 --> 19:38.907
Hey, so, uh, funny thing.

19:38.976 --> 19:41.877
Um, your story
had a second part, huh?

19:41.946 --> 19:45.109
Yeah, the paper broke it in half,
'cause it was too long.

19:45.182 --> 19:47.116
Oh.

19:47.184 --> 19:51.951
Well, uh, you know,
maybe my story has a second part too.

19:52.022 --> 19:56.959
Eric, your story ended with,
''And he never saw that crazy bitch again.''

19:59.897 --> 20:04.527
Well, you know, that
was just a prequel...

20:05.770 --> 20:08.500
to a story entitled, uh...

20:08.572 --> 20:11.837
''He Did See That Crazy Bitch Again,
and She Was a Delight.''

20:14.245 --> 20:17.976
Okay, I was-
I was pretty mad when I wrote that.

20:18.048 --> 20:21.313
Eric, I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings...

20:21.385 --> 20:24.513
but I guess I was mad
when I wrote mine too.

20:24.588 --> 20:26.613
At least when I started.

20:26.690 --> 20:30.217
But once I got all that stuff off my chest,
I mean, I felt better about us-

20:30.294 --> 20:33.092
more like the second half
of my story.

20:33.164 --> 20:37.965
So, uh- So what happens
to Derek and Wanda?

20:38.035 --> 20:41.562
Well, in the story, they went off
on their own adventures.

20:41.639 --> 20:45.473
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
that's probably good for them.

20:45.543 --> 20:48.307
Yeah, it's probably time
they moved on.

20:48.379 --> 20:51.815
Sure.
Derek's gonna be fine.

20:51.882 --> 20:55.010
He's a smart guy.

20:55.085 --> 20:57.212
The wenches love him.

20:59.390 --> 21:02.086
Yeah, well, Wanda's
gonna do great too.

21:02.159 --> 21:05.526
Oh, yeah, sure.
She'll get all the wenches she wants.

21:05.596 --> 21:08.793
Oh, my God, Donna,
there's your story.

21:08.866 --> 21:11.699
- ''Wanda and the Dirty Wenches.''
- ( Laughing )

21:11.769 --> 21:15.296
- Shut up.
- I know. I know.

21:15.372 --> 21:17.340
That's a movie.

21:23.147 --> 21:27.880
Uh! Oh, Fez, I can't hold my
feelings inside any longer.

21:27.952 --> 21:31.854
Yes, we must finally tell you
how much we desire you.

21:31.922 --> 21:34.447
And it's not just us, Fez.

21:34.525 --> 21:36.516
( Shuddering Chuckle )

21:37.528 --> 21:40.088
Oh, I knew it all along.

21:40.164 --> 21:42.655
Now let's consummate me.

21:46.337 --> 21:48.328
Ahh, oh, boy.

21:48.405 --> 21:50.805
This is the best story ever.
