00:12.240 --> 00:14.680
Movies! Rent your movies!

00:16.040 --> 00:17.630
Oh, sorry man.

00:17.660 --> 00:19.230
Nice outfit!

00:19.230 --> 00:21.020
It's a costume!

00:21.030 --> 00:23.120
They make me wear it!

00:24.150 --> 00:26.650
Movie night!

00:26.700 --> 00:28.590
I got the popcorn!

00:28.590 --> 00:30.250
I got the movie!

00:30.280 --> 00:32.380
Wait, I thought we were watching Shy Guy.

00:32.409 --> 00:34.380
Dude, you've seen that movie 100 times.

00:34.380 --> 00:35.440
I got something better.

00:36.730 --> 00:38.140
Ello Gov'nor?

00:38.260 --> 00:40.440
Yeah man, it's foreign. Check it.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.020
A British taxi is possessed by the soul of its driver,

00:43.020 --> 00:45.820
seeking revenge on the lowly gang members who murdered him.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.860
Pay the fare... or pay the price.

00:48.900 --> 00:51.210
No dude, not a horror movie!

00:51.210 --> 00:53.710
Last time I had to walk you to the bathroom every night for a week!

00:53.760 --> 00:55.410
No, man, it'll be different.

00:55.410 --> 00:58.030
This one is old and cheesy. It will be hilarious!

00:58.140 --> 00:59.650
You sure you can handle it?

00:59.650 --> 01:01.390
Dude, it's in black and white. Come on.

01:01.390 --> 01:02.940
Mmm... alright.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.250
See, isn't this fun?

01:24.690 --> 01:26.520
Ello, gov'nor!

01:36.080 --> 01:38.040
Ello, gov'nor!

01:47.310 --> 01:49.030
Ello, gov'nor!

01:55.740 --> 01:57.820
Ello, gov'nor!

01:59.110 --> 02:00.440
Ello, gov'nor!

02:10.949 --> 02:12.070
Is it over?

02:12.550 --> 02:14.810
Dude, that was so cheesy.

02:14.810 --> 02:16.240
I mean, what was up with the taxi?

02:16.240 --> 02:19.510
Was it supposed to be evil or normal but haunted by a ghost...

02:19.510 --> 02:21.770
...controlling the taxi or what? You know?

02:43.510 --> 02:45.150
Mordecai!

02:48.180 --> 02:51.510
Mordecai! Wake up! Wake up!

02:51.510 --> 02:53.210
Ello, gov'nor!

02:58.600 --> 03:01.360
Dude, chill out! You're screaming like a freaking maniac!

03:01.360 --> 03:03.020
I keep having nightmares!

03:03.020 --> 03:04.940
Just dream about something else then.

03:05.370 --> 03:07.410
Dream like you're a tough guy or something.

03:09.850 --> 03:11.020
I'm a tough guy.

03:11.390 --> 03:12.520
I'm a tough guy.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.030
They say this city's tough.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.880
But I'm tougher.

03:24.700 --> 03:28.260
You walked down the wrong alley, Riggerson.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.310
The name's... Fists!

03:34.110 --> 03:35.730
Ello, gov'nor!

03:42.760 --> 03:44.180
What the heck, Rigby?!

03:44.180 --> 03:47.330
It's that stupid British taxi! It's all up inside my brain!

03:47.500 --> 03:49.770
I knew it! I knew this would happen!

03:49.770 --> 03:51.570
I told you we shouldn't have watched that movie!

03:51.570 --> 03:53.830
I know. I'm sorry. I can't help it.

03:54.650 --> 03:57.870
Alright dude, we'll just desensitize you to the horror.

03:57.890 --> 03:59.480
We're gonna watch "Ello Gov'nor"

03:59.480 --> 04:02.280
over and over again until you stop being scared.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.440
Look at it! Look at it!

04:04.440 --> 04:05.480
- Let me go! - It's not real!

04:05.480 --> 04:07.330
You can see the microphone showing!

04:07.330 --> 04:08.900
- Look at it! - Get off me!

04:08.930 --> 04:10.270
I'm sick of you keeping me up!

04:10.310 --> 04:12.500
- You look at it!  - Let me go!

04:12.540 --> 04:14.520
- Look at it!  - Let me go!

04:14.610 --> 04:17.709
Look at it! Look.... At it.

04:18.060 --> 04:20.870
You look at it. You...look at it.

04:21.149 --> 04:23.690
Let.... Me.... GO!

04:26.100 --> 04:28.020
What the heck is going on?!

04:28.040 --> 04:31.130
Rigby's just freaked out by this dumb British movie we watched.

04:31.170 --> 04:32.790
Well, you'd better have this mess cleaned up

04:32.790 --> 04:35.140
by the time I get back from my cricket game!

04:35.230 --> 04:36.400
- Cricket? - Yeah.

04:36.430 --> 04:38.500
I'm trying new things. So what?

04:38.950 --> 04:40.390
Will British people be there?

04:40.390 --> 04:42.740
It's cricket, what do you think?

04:46.450 --> 04:48.460
See Rigby, there's nothing to be afraid of.

04:48.460 --> 04:50.760
See how calm and collected these British dudes are?

04:50.970 --> 04:55.080
Ello gov'nor! Ello gov'nor, ello gov'nor, ello, ello, ello...

04:57.980 --> 04:59.180
Ello, gov'nor!

05:00.380 --> 05:03.210
Rigby! RIGBY!

05:03.440 --> 05:06.930
Aw man, I knew we shouldn't have watched that lame car movie.

05:06.930 --> 05:08.800
He's scared of cars now?

05:08.870 --> 05:10.630
No, just British taxis.

05:10.690 --> 05:12.260
What a silly notion,

05:12.310 --> 05:15.130
my British taxi isn't scary at all.

05:15.170 --> 05:17.590
Wait, Pops, you own a British taxi?

05:17.630 --> 05:18.670
Yes!

05:19.660 --> 05:21.110
What's in the barn?

05:21.140 --> 05:23.300
Something that's gonna get rid of your fear.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.560
There she is!

05:25.640 --> 05:27.340
Isn't she a beauty?

05:27.810 --> 05:30.560
What the heck Pops? I thought you said you had a British taxi!

05:30.620 --> 05:32.040
A British taxi?

05:32.040 --> 05:34.990
Oh, I thought you said a brownish taxi!

05:34.990 --> 05:36.370
But that taxi's yellow.

05:36.470 --> 05:40.670
Yellow? My taxi is no coward, I guarantee you that!

05:40.670 --> 05:42.080
Never mind.

05:43.490 --> 05:44.830
Ready to go for a ride?

05:44.830 --> 05:46.440
In that thing?! No way!

05:46.470 --> 05:48.790
It's not even a British taxi! Come on.

05:48.790 --> 05:50.670
I don't care, a taxi's a taxi!

05:50.670 --> 05:53.120
It'll be fun! We'll just go for a little ride.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.240
Uhh, I got to go to the bathroom.

06:05.010 --> 06:06.970
Ello, gov'nor!

06:11.470 --> 06:13.280
Ello, gov'nor!

06:20.260 --> 06:21.440
Let's go, let's go!

06:21.670 --> 06:22.360
Drive!

06:25.340 --> 06:26.490
What?! What is it?!

06:26.570 --> 06:28.920
That British taxi, man! It's following me!

06:28.930 --> 06:31.120
Dude, come on! You're just seeing things!

06:31.120 --> 06:33.620
No! It was the British taxi and it was real!

06:33.620 --> 06:35.020
So it came out of the movie then?

06:35.050 --> 06:36.650
I don't know! Maybe!

06:36.670 --> 06:39.140
All right, fine, look, you're safe now anyways.

06:39.140 --> 06:40.800
Let's just try to relax and calm down,

06:40.800 --> 06:42.370
Pops will drive us around for a bit.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.870
Wait, Pops! Where are we going?

06:58.870 --> 07:01.040
I always drive deep into the woods

07:01.040 --> 07:03.230
when I want to clear my mind.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.190
Don't you just love the scenery?

07:22.000 --> 07:22.970
Oh, bother.

07:22.970 --> 07:25.240
What? Why are we stopping?! What's going on?!

07:25.240 --> 07:27.860
It seems we've run out of gasoline.

07:27.860 --> 07:29.670
Oh man, oh man, this is not good!

07:29.670 --> 07:32.620
He's coming and we're stuck here! Mordecai!

07:32.670 --> 07:34.170
What, what is it?!

07:34.200 --> 07:36.980
We ran out of gas, and he's coming for me!

07:38.240 --> 07:40.210
Come on, we gotta get out and push.

07:40.280 --> 07:41.520
Come on, Rigby!

07:41.520 --> 07:43.520
No! I'm not going out there!

07:43.520 --> 07:46.660
Fine, Pops and I will push you all the way home then.

07:46.870 --> 07:48.030
Geez.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.970
No, no, no, no, no, not back this way!

07:59.750 --> 08:01.980
No, no, no, no, no!

08:02.910 --> 08:04.380
All right, help!

08:06.120 --> 08:07.200
Rigby!

08:10.030 --> 08:11.460
Ello, gov'nor!

08:11.460 --> 08:13.070
Holy crap, it's real!

08:13.070 --> 08:14.220
Run, Pops!

08:28.280 --> 08:29.510
Pops, look out!

08:34.659 --> 08:37.480
Oh no! It's going after Rigby! We gotta help him!

08:37.480 --> 08:39.179
Rigby!

08:51.850 --> 08:53.350
Ello, gov'nor.

08:54.380 --> 08:55.660
Rigby!

09:01.880 --> 09:03.750
Ello, gov'nor!

09:03.750 --> 09:05.580
I'm no gov'nor!

09:10.320 --> 09:12.510
Ello, gov'nor!

09:14.580 --> 09:16.720
The name's FISTS!

09:17.510 --> 09:21.340
Leave me alone! I hate you!

09:25.710 --> 09:28.800
Stop following me around!

09:28.800 --> 09:30.300
Rigby! Wake up!

09:30.610 --> 09:33.130
- Rigby, stop it! - Stop...

09:33.340 --> 09:34.470
Mordecai?

09:34.470 --> 09:36.880
Oh, thank show you're all right.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.180
I did it, I conquered my fear.

09:40.180 --> 09:44.030
I cleaned that taxi's clock, with my fists.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.090
Kind of,

09:45.130 --> 09:47.800
you hit your head and started going psycho on the taxi,

09:47.900 --> 09:50.160
but, actually, the taxi was a kid.

09:54.530 --> 09:55.480
You?!

09:55.480 --> 09:56.840
Yeah, what's your problem?

09:56.840 --> 09:59.740
Why were you following me in that taxi suit?

10:00.120 --> 10:02.100
My boss made me wear this.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.670
I'm from the video store.

10:03.710 --> 10:05.630
Your rental is overdue.

10:05.930 --> 10:07.930
Why didn't you just call or something?

10:07.930 --> 10:10.300
I did! And I sent a fax!

10:10.350 --> 10:11.400
That was you?!

10:11.450 --> 10:12.380
Yes!

10:12.390 --> 10:14.550
So can you just return the video, please?

10:14.780 --> 10:15.860
We broke it.

10:15.910 --> 10:17.630
Well, you're gonna have to pay for it.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.220
Pops?

10:19.510 --> 10:20.560
Of course.

10:20.740 --> 10:23.850
I'm afraid the smallest bill I have is a hundred.

10:23.850 --> 10:26.060
- Will that do? - Yeah, sure.

10:27.470 --> 10:29.240
Is this some kind of joke?

10:31.690 --> 10:33.510
I gotta get a better job.

10:35.610 --> 10:38.310
- Hey, Mordecai? - Augh, not again!

10:38.310 --> 10:40.290
Don't worry dude, I'm not scared again. I just...

10:40.520 --> 10:43.250
Thanks dude, for helping me out with my fears and stuff.

10:43.390 --> 10:44.630
No problem, man.

10:44.730 --> 10:46.880
- Good night, Rigby. - Good night, Mordecai.

10:49.070 --> 10:51.640
They say this city's pretty tough.

10:51.780 --> 10:53.570
But I'm tougher.
