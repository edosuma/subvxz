01:22.760 --> 01:23.800
Karen…

01:24.560 --> 01:25.840
What are you doing?

01:27.400 --> 01:29.000
I'm sorry, Josefine.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.080
Mom!

01:32.680 --> 01:33.640
Dad!

01:34.480 --> 01:35.520
Help!

01:37.680 --> 01:38.560
Help me.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.520
I can't.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.880
-Yes.
-No.

01:46.760 --> 01:47.760
There, there.

01:48.720 --> 01:49.720
Easy now.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.880
You brought chaos.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.800
Please help me. Please.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.040
I have to restore order.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.040
-No.
-Yes.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.000
Please…

02:05.600 --> 02:06.640
I can't.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.480
I'm sorry.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.520
Yes, you can.

02:11.560 --> 02:12.560
Karen, don't go!

02:12.640 --> 02:15.320
Don't go.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.320
Come back.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.600
Help!

02:22.960 --> 02:23.960
Help!

02:25.800 --> 02:26.840
Help!

03:37.280 --> 03:38.480
What happened?

03:38.560 --> 03:41.480
Easy now. What is it? What happened?

03:41.560 --> 03:43.440
Karen took her. Josefine.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.480
-Where is Josefine? Where is she?
-I don't know.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.200
-Where is she?
-Karen took her.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.520
-What do you mean?
-Karen took Josefine!

03:58.800 --> 03:59.840
There we go.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.200
Try it now.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.320
It's still not working.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.000
What do we do?

04:19.680 --> 04:21.560
No, hey… Listen.

04:22.480 --> 04:23.800
We can do it, okay?

04:24.440 --> 04:25.480
Liv, look at me.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.320
It'll be okay.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.120
Okay?

04:30.600 --> 04:32.880
We'll find the others and get help.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.000
Liv.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.080
We can do it.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.800
Yes…

05:59.760 --> 06:01.160
Come on.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.080
Kasper!

06:21.440 --> 06:22.640
Oh my God!

06:23.240 --> 06:24.320
All right.

06:25.000 --> 06:25.840
Take it easy.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.440
Where's Josefine?

06:29.040 --> 06:30.440
-I don't know.
-Where's Karen?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.360
Her car was already here.

06:32.440 --> 06:33.760
Where's Karen?

06:33.840 --> 06:35.680
It's my child. She took my child.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.360
Where is she?
Didn't you talk to her? Didn't you?

06:39.120 --> 06:40.680
Why are you looking at each other?

06:40.760 --> 06:42.000
What is it?

06:42.080 --> 06:43.000
Say something!

06:43.080 --> 06:45.560
We need to get fence fixed. You do it.

06:45.640 --> 06:46.800
-Fixed?
-What's happening?

06:46.880 --> 06:48.320
I know where your daughter is.

06:50.000 --> 06:50.880
Keys to the gate.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.560
Hook up the generator over there.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.120
Can you manage?

06:58.720 --> 06:59.760
Yes.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.640
We'll find her.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.280
-Kasper.
-No, Mom. I'm going too.

07:46.840 --> 07:47.880
Kee-Ko.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.360
I can't get free.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.200
I'm stuck.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.520
Together?

08:13.880 --> 08:15.080
Yes.

08:15.680 --> 08:16.720
That's good.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.320
Faster.

08:45.280 --> 08:46.320
Kasper.

08:47.720 --> 08:48.760
Jose!

08:50.080 --> 08:51.120
Hey.

08:58.560 --> 09:00.840
I thought you were…

09:02.560 --> 09:03.680
You little shit.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.560
You big shit.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.280
Get away from there.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.440
Get away from there.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.200
Karen, they're coming.

09:20.080 --> 09:21.040
Leave her be.

09:23.640 --> 09:24.760
She took their baby.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.440
She killed an adult elf.

09:26.520 --> 09:28.800
This doesn't stop if we don't stop it.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.320
Grandma.

09:34.480 --> 09:36.160
I know it's hard, honey.

09:36.760 --> 09:40.240
If we let her go, the baby will follow her
and attract the rest of them.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.280
Come over here. Come on.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.880
Grandma, stop.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.240
-Come on.
-Stop.

09:47.640 --> 09:48.640
Stop.

09:50.000 --> 09:50.840
Liv.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.440
Now!

09:52.520 --> 09:53.560
Come on!

09:55.840 --> 09:57.200
What are you doing?

09:59.280 --> 10:01.040
Stop. Stop it.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.160
Honey.

10:12.640 --> 10:13.800
Come over here.

10:13.880 --> 10:14.840
They're coming.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.480
Liv.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.040
Come here.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.480
Come over here.

10:20.560 --> 10:21.600
Now.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.120
This is your last warning.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.000
Kee-Ko!

10:34.760 --> 10:37.200
No! Karen, stop!

10:38.080 --> 10:40.240
-Karen, stop!
-Stop!

10:53.400 --> 10:54.600
Grandma…

11:04.480 --> 11:05.480
Stay!

11:21.040 --> 11:22.040
Come on.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.200
We're leaving now.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.200
Come on.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.200
Come on. Come.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.440
We're leaving. Come on.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.920
Come on!

11:37.000 --> 11:38.400
We're leaving! Now!

11:39.400 --> 11:41.600
Come on. Please come with me.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.560
We belong together.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.280
Are you okay, Liv?

12:35.240 --> 12:36.800
Jose, are you okay?

12:43.080 --> 12:44.840
-There's one on the car.
-Where is it?

12:46.920 --> 12:48.360
On the side.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.040
What do we do? Møller, do something!

12:55.040 --> 12:56.160
Hold on tight.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.520
Is it gone?

13:03.600 --> 13:05.880
-I think I got rid of it.
-I don't think so.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.680
Get her in, Kasper!

13:12.400 --> 13:13.520
Liv!

13:13.600 --> 13:15.240
Liv, hold on!

13:16.240 --> 13:17.280
Hold on, Liv!

13:17.840 --> 13:19.600
Liv, hold on!

13:19.680 --> 13:21.120
Hold on, Liv!

13:21.200 --> 13:22.800
Kasper. Kasper, here!

13:23.960 --> 13:25.720
It's a cattle prod. Use it.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.000
-Hold on tight!
-Liv!

13:43.000 --> 13:44.440
Liv, are you okay?

13:44.520 --> 13:46.160
-Look at me.
-Yes, I'm okay.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.200
Great. Did you get rid of it?

13:48.280 --> 13:49.360
-I don't know.
-Is it gone?

13:49.440 --> 13:51.640
-I don't know!
-Check if it's there.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.480
Hold on!

14:22.520 --> 14:23.440
Jose.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.640
Hello? Jose.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.120
Jose. Are you okay?

14:29.200 --> 14:31.400
Hello? Jose, are you okay?

14:32.320 --> 14:33.920
You're okay.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.560
Jose. Come on.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.400
Come on, man!

15:13.960 --> 15:15.280
-Switch it to zero again.
-Yes.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.000
-Back to one. Is it at one?
-Yes. It's on one now.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.800
-Why won't it start?
-Pull harder.

15:19.880 --> 15:23.720
-If I pull any harder, I'll break it.
-Then pump it harder!

15:23.800 --> 15:27.280
-If I pump too hard, it'll flood.
-So we just stand here and look at it?

15:27.360 --> 15:29.640
I'll pump it, then. Maybe that'll work.

15:42.480 --> 15:45.080
No, no, no!

15:45.600 --> 15:47.720
Mom! Dad!

15:51.440 --> 15:52.520
Come on!

15:52.600 --> 15:54.360
Mads! Hurry!

15:56.760 --> 15:57.880
Come on!

15:57.960 --> 15:59.080
Run!

15:59.160 --> 16:01.320
Come on! Run!

16:01.400 --> 16:02.880
Mads, I'm opening the gate.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.440
It's still not up and running.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.360
Jose, come on.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.080
Run! Hurry up!

16:14.160 --> 16:15.400
Run!

16:24.200 --> 16:25.280
Møller!

16:26.160 --> 16:27.000
Is it back up?

16:39.640 --> 16:40.560
Josefine.

17:12.080 --> 17:12.920
We made it.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.360
Let's get you home.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.320
Ready to go?

18:14.600 --> 18:16.360
We'll fix this our way.

18:17.080 --> 18:18.680
Go home, forget all about it.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.440
I just left it.

18:22.360 --> 18:23.600
I promised I'd…

18:24.600 --> 18:26.000
That we'd be together.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.320
You had to choose your family.

18:28.840 --> 18:29.920
But you know what?

18:31.160 --> 18:32.400
You'll always have it here.

18:35.680 --> 18:36.640
Merry Christmas.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.000
What happens now?

18:56.040 --> 18:56.880
Here?

18:58.440 --> 19:00.200
Møller and I will fix it all.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.760
And then it'll be like it was.

19:03.320 --> 19:04.400
Is that what you want?

19:18.640 --> 19:20.400
-You need to leave.
-Yes.

19:21.280 --> 19:22.320
We do.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.240
All the Christmas presents
are at the house.

20:58.680 --> 20:59.720
That's okay.

21:01.240 --> 21:02.440
No, you're right.

21:03.640 --> 21:06.000
The gift we got you was pretty childish.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.040
What was it?

21:12.240 --> 21:15.120
-Do you really want to know? Do you?
-Yes.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.280
Are you sure? I'm not going to tell you.

21:24.600 --> 21:25.680
Big girl.

22:36.720 --> 22:39.040
