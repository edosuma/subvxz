17:10.030 --> 17:12.463
- And so it's really important
that when you have good times

17:12.565 --> 17:13.698
that you help feed people.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.633
- If we have extra,
can I eat one?

17:15.735 --> 17:18.002
- Well, pappy already
ate our share.

17:18.104 --> 17:19.837
- [laughing]

17:19.939 --> 17:21.506
- you're doing a great job.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.842
- Today we packed
over 700 meals.

17:24.944 --> 17:28.279
47% of kids in the country
qualify for free

17:28.381 --> 17:30.615
and reduced lunches in america.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.783
So thank you all so much.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.151
We're gonna take
this group picture.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.319
Y'all ready?
Three, two, one, smile.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.121
Awesome.
Go crazy, everybody.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.524
[all screaming]
- I appreciate you.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.492
- Awesome.
Thank you so much.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.728
- We enjoyed that.
- Good job, gang.

17:58.511 --> 18:01.746
- Hey, can I help you?
- Oh.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.414
This is awesome.

18:03.516 --> 18:04.849
I'm aaron.

18:04.951 --> 18:07.819
I mean, you're a legend.
Hey.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.253
- How are you?
- Good.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.289
- Good to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.958
She didn't tell you
that I won an auction

18:14.060 --> 18:15.493
to get to spend
the day with you.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.995
- Surprise.
- I grew up watching you.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.764
My dad showed me
all of your videos,

18:19.866 --> 18:22.333
and I'm--I'm like--
you're a living legend.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.837
And I'm, like,
standing right here. Oh.

18:25.939 --> 18:29.640
- Sometimes tammy signs me up
for charity auctions

18:29.742 --> 18:33.010
and then forgets to tell me.
[chuckles]

18:33.113 --> 18:34.445
- this is gonna be
the best day.

18:34.547 --> 18:37.648
We're gonna have the best day.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.817
Can I get a selfie with you
to show my kids?

18:39.919 --> 18:40.985
- Tammy will take it.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.420
- Oh, cool.
- Take it, babe.

18:42.522 --> 18:43.855
- Can I kiss the top
of your head or...?

18:43.957 --> 18:46.457
- No, no, no, no, no.

18:46.559 --> 18:47.525
- Oh, my.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.861
- That's you.
- Yeah.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.395
- It is.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.464
- I can't believe I got to
spend all day with this guy.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.500
This guy--

18:55.602 --> 18:57.268
something's not right here.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.337
- Is this what I think it is?
- Hey.

18:59.439 --> 19:00.705
- Can I hoist it?
- No, no, no.

19:00.807 --> 19:01.873
Put that back up there.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.241
Nobody touches that

19:03.343 --> 19:04.542
but people that played
on my football team.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.644
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Look, what I found.

19:06.746 --> 19:09.714
Can we throw
the pigskin around, please?

19:09.816 --> 19:13.050
Get in there.
- All right. You feel my hand?

19:13.153 --> 19:14.719
- Deeper.
- Hike.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.188
<i> [goofy music]</i>

19:17.290 --> 19:19.023
- oh.
[laughing]

19:19.125 --> 19:20.892
- touchdown, baby!
- Touchdown!

19:20.994 --> 19:23.394
Can we do, like, a dance?
- No, I didn't dance.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.030
- Can I have one of these?
- Huh?

19:26.132 --> 19:28.232
- Look at this one.

19:28.334 --> 19:31.435
Amazing.
[object shatters]

19:33.473 --> 19:35.773
I've always wanted, like,
a terry bradshaw tattoo.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.074
- Okay.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.776
- Just right here
like a tramp stamp.

19:38.878 --> 19:42.580
Just sign your name on my body,
and I'll get a tattoo of it.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.583
- Kind of spongy back here.
All right. That's it.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.319
- Thank you. Oh, my god.
That is a dream come true.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.754
- Did you have fun today?
- Yes.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.589
- Well, there was
a charity auction,

19:51.691 --> 19:55.760
and I really did bid in it,
but this is not a fan.

19:55.862 --> 19:59.830
This is an actor I hired
to come up here and pester you.

20:01.801 --> 20:05.102
'cause I would never
really have this happen.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.604
[laughter]

20:06.706 --> 20:08.940
- I can't believe you put up
with me for that long.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.775
- I know.
You were so nice.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.276
- I got to tell you,
he ought to go

20:12.378 --> 20:13.644
to hollywood 'cause he did--

20:13.746 --> 20:15.947
- he was a good actor.
- He was real good.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.381
[laughter]

20:17.483 --> 20:19.917
- and he's got your autograph
on his back now.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.720
- I might get a real tattoo.
[laughter]

20:22.822 --> 20:24.522
- you are the worst.

20:24.624 --> 20:28.292
Hey, I know that you didn't
like the horse painting.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.628
<i> [horse neighs]</i>

20:34.534 --> 20:39.136
and that fan thing
was a payback, right?

20:39.239 --> 20:41.806
- Yeah.
- Ah.

20:41.908 --> 20:45.476
Well, it was a good surprise,
actually, looking back on it.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.579
Pretty doggone funny
and clever.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.381
- We did it.
- Good job. Thank you.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.483
- Thank you. Yes, that was fun.
- Wow.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.653
<i> - What's for dinner?</i>
<i> [laughter]</i>

20:55.755 --> 20:58.956
- the grand ole opry want us
to sing on father's day.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.691
- Aah!
- Aah!

21:02.028 --> 21:03.160
Whoa!

21:03.263 --> 21:04.328
Where did zurie go, everyone?

21:04.430 --> 21:05.997
- Where'd she go?

21:06.099 --> 21:07.832
- Oh, my god!
- Yes!

21:07.934 --> 21:11.535
- Terry and rachel bradshaw!
[cheers and applause]
