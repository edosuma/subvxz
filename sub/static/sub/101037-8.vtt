37:06.206 --> 37:08.620
- That's not the glow
of a blushing bride.

37:08.689 --> 37:11.379
- Oh, Dad...

37:11.448 --> 37:13.586
the blush was fucked out
of me years ago.

37:13.655 --> 37:14.689
- Jesus.

37:17.103 --> 37:19.344
Baby, I love our man-to-man
talks, but...

37:19.413 --> 37:21.551
We need to set some
goddamn boundaries here.

37:21.620 --> 37:23.655
I can't unhear that, honey.

37:23.724 --> 37:27.000
- It was a metaphor, sort of...

37:31.931 --> 37:33.862
Look, I gotta
show you something.

37:35.896 --> 37:40.551
But before I do, I want you
to know this about me--

37:42.793 --> 37:45.275
I know you already know it,
but I got to say it again.

37:49.758 --> 37:51.551
Everything I do is for you.

37:53.344 --> 37:54.827
To please you.

37:57.206 --> 37:58.310
To protect you.

37:59.931 --> 38:02.137
And I can tell you
what I think is best,

38:02.206 --> 38:05.827
with data and facts
and zero emotion,

38:05.896 --> 38:08.448
but I will do whatever
it is you tell me to do.

38:10.482 --> 38:11.724
- Okay.

38:29.448 --> 38:31.827
- And you believe this
offer is legitimate?

38:31.896 --> 38:34.034
- They will wire
ten percent earnest money

38:34.103 --> 38:37.620
tomorrow with
a seven day close.

38:37.689 --> 38:41.379
- Now you're going to tell me
all the reasons I should do it.

38:41.448 --> 38:43.517
- I don't believe in should.

38:43.586 --> 38:46.344
All I'll tell you is the
consequences of not doing it.

38:48.172 --> 38:50.379
And all I ask is
that you listen.

38:52.551 --> 38:55.000
- I'll listen, honey.

38:55.068 --> 38:56.827
- If you don't accept,

38:56.896 --> 38:59.172
they will press the state
to condemn the land.

39:00.275 --> 39:02.344
They will file a motion
to recuse Jamie

39:02.413 --> 39:03.758
from representing the State

39:03.827 --> 39:06.620
because of his financial
interests in the ranch.

39:06.689 --> 39:10.275
They will bring in
outside counsel and Jamie,

39:10.344 --> 39:11.655
and oh how much I hate him,

39:11.724 --> 39:14.620
he is the litigator
for the state,

39:14.689 --> 39:18.137
and he will no longer
be available to us,

39:18.206 --> 39:20.620
unless he resigns.

39:20.689 --> 39:23.068
And even I can see the value
in having him in office

39:23.137 --> 39:26.310
at this particular moment.

39:26.379 --> 39:28.206
They will condemn this land

39:28.275 --> 39:32.448
and they will pay you
fifteen cents on the dollar.

39:32.517 --> 39:34.103
If that.

39:34.172 --> 39:36.379
And what remains of the ranch
will be taken from you

39:36.448 --> 39:40.103
in a similar fashion, which
doesn't really fucking matter

39:40.172 --> 39:42.827
because the property taxes
will most likely

39:42.896 --> 39:45.758
erode your savings within
the next three to four years.

39:45.827 --> 39:49.241
Now I can cover them
for a couple more,

39:49.310 --> 39:51.586
but in the end you're
just selling off land

39:51.655 --> 39:55.413
to pay the taxes
while making nothing.

39:55.482 --> 39:57.310
So the cycle will continue
until the ranch

39:57.379 --> 40:02.137
is whittled down to its
least valuable parts.

40:02.206 --> 40:03.206
Then you'll die,

40:06.275 --> 40:08.793
and there will be no way for
Kayce and certainly not Tate

40:08.862 --> 40:10.241
to make a living from it...

40:12.655 --> 40:14.689
and just like that,
seven generations

40:14.758 --> 40:18.758
of our family legacy will be
carved into little ranchettes,

40:18.827 --> 40:20.655
where people will
spend the summer

40:20.724 --> 40:22.137
wondering what
this place looked like

40:22.206 --> 40:24.689
before they got there
when it was ours.

40:28.413 --> 40:30.586
- I don't doubt a word
you're saying, honey. Not one.

40:32.068 --> 40:34.413
But I...

40:34.482 --> 40:35.965
I can't sell it.

40:36.034 --> 40:38.827
- You wouldn't be selling
the ranch, Dad, just the land--

40:38.896 --> 40:41.758
- Not an inch. Not one.

40:45.482 --> 40:47.000
It's the last thing he asked me.

40:49.517 --> 40:52.413
There's gotta be another way.
- There isn't.

40:52.482 --> 40:54.620
- Nah, there's always
another way.

40:59.586 --> 41:02.724
- Please don't let pride factor
into this decision, Dad.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.000
It's just too big.

41:04.068 --> 41:06.034
- No pride, honey. It's just...

41:07.068 --> 41:08.172
I made a promise.

41:10.241 --> 41:12.379
And I'd rather lose it
than break it.

41:14.206 --> 41:16.275
And he'd rather...

41:16.344 --> 41:18.413
He'd rather me lose it too.

41:23.827 --> 41:26.689
I think I'm gonna turn in
for the evening, honey.
