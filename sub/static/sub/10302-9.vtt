02:09.320 --> 02:11.038
Oh, quick, Bud.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.152
Change the channel.
It's sweeps month...

02:17.400 --> 02:20.153
...so Christian Slater's
gonna show America his butt.

02:21.720 --> 02:25.030
Kelly, now, this may come
as a surprise to you...

02:25.280 --> 02:27.430
...then again, the fact
that people can ride...

02:27.640 --> 02:30.871
...upright in the backseat of a car
came as a surprise to you.

02:31.240 --> 02:34.516
There are far more important things
than Christian Slater's butt.

02:34.720 --> 02:38.030
Now, for instance, the president's
giving an important press conference.

02:38.280 --> 02:40.157
We interrupt the press conference...

02:40.360 --> 02:43.909
...for live coverage
of Christian Slater's butt.

02:50.720 --> 02:54.315
Move over, kids.
It's time for our favourite talk show.

02:54.560 --> 02:57.870
But, Mom, we were watching
the president's press conference.

02:59.080 --> 03:02.277
That jogging's
been doing him some good.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.919
Live, from Chicago...

03:07.160 --> 03:11.711
...it's Jerry Springer,
the masculine feminist.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.749
Good evening, women,
I'm Jerry Springer...

03:16.000 --> 03:19.231
...and I am proud to be living
in your world.

03:21.440 --> 03:25.956
Before we start, I wanna tak e a moment
to apologize on behalf of all men...

03:26.200 --> 03:30.034
...for the disgusting way
Burt has mistreated Loni.

03:33.440 --> 03:34.668
Good move, Burt.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.754
And Cop and 1/2? Good movie too.

03:39.640 --> 03:42.438
I mean, when are men
gonna realize...

03:42.680 --> 03:47.231
...that women are this world's
most precious natural resource?

03:47.480 --> 03:50.517
Except, of course, for our sponsor.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.955
I Can't Believe It's A Tampon.

03:58.200 --> 04:03.274
It feels so natural you're gonna wish
it was always that time of the month.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.114
A masculine feminist.
What does that mean?

04:10.760 --> 04:13.069
It means he likes show tunes.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.110
Would that they all did.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.635
Jerry has the hottest
talk show around.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.031
Is he gonna show his butt?

04:22.680 --> 04:24.716
Jerry is politically correct.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.350
He's keeping his butt
covered until all women are free.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.310
I wish Al would.

04:31.840 --> 04:34.752
At least until all women
were warned.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.275
Well, Jerry's not just a talker.
He's a doer.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.830
Last week he found out there was no
bowling alley in this part of town...

04:41.040 --> 04:43.838
...with a ladies-only night.
So Jerry did something about it.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.155
We had a bloat-in.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.994
A hundred of us waited
until we were really grumpy...

04:51.240 --> 04:55.074
...then stormed the bowling alley and
chained ourselves to the ball returns.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.596
Which, in hindsight,
turned out to be an error.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.557
At least those little blower things
were kind of enjoyable.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.114
But what's important
is that Jerry helped women...

05:07.360 --> 05:09.749
...finally get a bowling night,
which is tonight.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.958
- Some guys lost their bowling night.
- Yeah, I wonder who.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.553
Hi, honey. I'm home.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.672
Why am I early
on what used to be my bowling night?

05:31.920 --> 05:33.831
Good question.
Thank you for asking.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.477
Well, as I entered the bowling alley
ready for an exciting night...

05:37.720 --> 05:39.676
...of bonding, brewskies
and barfing...

05:39.920 --> 05:45.358
...what did I see?
Women. Bowling. Overhand.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.239
Naturally, I went up
to one of these donut depositories...

05:49.440 --> 05:50.839
...and said in my nicest voice:

05:51.080 --> 05:54.550
"Wedge it out the door, beefalo,
it's my night to bowl."

05:55.080 --> 05:57.435
Instead of coming back at me verbally,
like I did...

05:57.640 --> 05:59.995
...they took their doughy fists
and they pounded on me...

06:00.240 --> 06:03.277
...until a mutual agreement
was reached that I leave.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.753
Anyway, when I regained
consciousness in a burning trash can...

06:06.960 --> 06:11.317
...I realized, A, Thursday nights
is now ladies' night...

06:11.560 --> 06:16.270
...and B, you don't wanna know
how a bum puts out a trash-can fire.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.555
Congratulations
to those fine women in Chicago...

06:21.760 --> 06:23.990
...for what they achieved
at Jim's Bowl-A-Rama.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.597
That's the pantywaist that cost me
my bowling night.

06:27.840 --> 06:31.628
Now we've gotta get the bowling alley
to enlarge the women's restroom.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.030
And what about mothers
who wanna nurse?

06:34.280 --> 06:36.874
I propose a lactation lounge.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.478
I propose a dairy farmer.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.757
Quiet, Klingon.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.359
Let's tak e some phone calls.

06:48.040 --> 06:51.715
Well, believe you me,
this outrage shall not go unavenged.

06:51.960 --> 06:55.111
- AI, don't you think women deserve...
- No!

06:56.080 --> 06:57.752
Just don't embarrass us, honey.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.759
- Is the caller there?
- AI Bundy here.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.319
Too late.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.632
Now, listen here, Jerry.
Bowling is a man's sport.

07:05.880 --> 07:09.031
If God had wanted women to bowl,
he would've put breasts on backs...

07:09.280 --> 07:12.397
...so we would have something to watch
while waiting our turn.

07:16.840 --> 07:20.230
And where are you
calling from, sir, 1952?

07:23.280 --> 07:26.636
I wish. Ike was in the White House,
women were in the kitchen...

07:26.880 --> 07:29.269
...and you were in the closet.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.196
And you forgot to mention
where you were, sir.

07:33.440 --> 07:38.719
I suspect in a zoo someplace, throwing
your faeces at a passing tourist.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.434
Once again, I wish.

07:42.640 --> 07:44.596
Enough of that call.
Let's tak e another one.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.233
You and your thundering herds...

07:46.480 --> 07:48.948
...may think you won,
but let me tell you something.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.549
Thursday nights have always been
men's bowling nights.

07:51.760 --> 07:54.832
And mark my words.
Next Thursday men will be bowling!

08:02.400 --> 08:03.719
All right, nice spare, Jim.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.911
If you shift
your weight to your rear foot...

08:06.160 --> 08:08.833
This is ridiculous.
I worked hard all week.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.150
I'm not gonna sit home
on bowling night.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.356
Well, we can't go back
to the bowling alley.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.238
Those women are too strong.

08:15.480 --> 08:18.438
We can't go home. We're too weak.

08:18.680 --> 08:20.318
Hey, I got it.
We can go to a movie.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.949
- Hey, yeah.
- Yeah.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.033
Hey, Peg.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.669
Peg, do we have a paper?

08:29.160 --> 08:30.752
Thank you.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.554
All right, let's see what's playing.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.835
Hey!

08:41.559 --> 08:43.835
Here's a gripping drama
about a newlywed couple...

08:44.039 --> 08:46.076
...waiting for their furniture to arrive.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.636
It's called, Where, Oh,
Where is the Mayflower Man?

08:50.360 --> 08:53.477
- Any boobs?
- William Hurt and Glenn Close.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.910
- Oh, jeez.
- Sounds like it blows.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.680
We could go to the newsstand
and buy a magazine.

08:58.920 --> 09:02.310
- Yeah, but where could we hide it?
- How about in your wife's hair?

09:02.800 --> 09:04.518
How about in your wife's chin?

09:07.440 --> 09:09.192
- Come on, now!
- Come on.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.715
Come on, they're making us turn
against each other.

09:11.920 --> 09:15.629
- There must be something we can do.
- I know where we can go.

09:15.880 --> 09:19.714
To the last great bastion
for the American red-blooded male.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.872
Where there is no such thing
as ladies' night.

09:23.360 --> 09:27.478
At the nudie bar!

09:32.840 --> 09:35.195
Where a buck's enough
to see their stuff.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.635
At the nudie bar!

09:37.880 --> 09:41.156
Where the breasts may be fake,
but, man, do they shake.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.391
At the nudie bar!

09:43.640 --> 09:46.598
Where you swear like a sailor
and wish you could nail her.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.592
At the nudie bar!

09:48.840 --> 09:52.196
Where the cops are at the door
and there's a Kennedy on the floor.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.750
At the nudie bar!

10:01.440 --> 10:03.635
Nudie bar.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.549
Hey, this is great.
It's better than bowling.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.598
You can work up a sweat
without working up a sweat.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.352
You know, I haven't been in here
since they jazzed up the place.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.556
And they even put up a curtain.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.916
And the mirrors are gone.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.917
Well, some things don't change.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.470
Gentlemen, present dollars.

10:29.720 --> 10:34.191
Hooters! Hooters! Hooters! Hoot...!

10:38.640 --> 10:39.868
Tonight...

10:40.080 --> 10:43.072
...I would like to dedicate
this poem...

10:43.320 --> 10:45.072
...to my ovaries.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.111
I don't think
we're in Kansas anymore.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.353
My eggs, my eggs

10:57.800 --> 11:01.679
He begs, he begs
To be the father of my eggs

11:06.800 --> 11:08.358
My eggs, my eggs

11:08.840 --> 11:11.912
Oh, swim to meet my eggs

11:30.880 --> 11:34.316
Boy, they really hit us
where it hurts this time.

11:34.920 --> 11:38.276
Turning the nudie bar
into a coffee house.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.671
What're we gonna do
with our Saturday nights?

11:40.920 --> 11:44.515
We could play bonbon toss
with your wife.

11:45.240 --> 11:48.277
Yeah, we can play peanut toss
with the elephant you call your wife.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.512
Come on.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.593
Doesn't the Constitution
guarantee us the right to life...

11:58.840 --> 12:01.149
...nudity and the pursuit
of happiness?

12:02.280 --> 12:04.953
Are you sure that's "nudity"?

12:05.200 --> 12:08.317
Life, nudity, yeah.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.788
This is the last straw.

12:10.040 --> 12:14.272
I say it's time we stood up
to the onslaught of this "womaninity."

12:14.520 --> 12:15.714
They've taken everything.

12:15.960 --> 12:19.430
I say it's time that we take
something away from them.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.919
Live, from Chicago...

12:24.120 --> 12:27.351
...it's Jerry Springer,
the masculine fe...

12:44.200 --> 12:46.589
Tonight's broadcast
of The Masculine Feminist...

12:46.840 --> 12:49.991
...has been commandeered
by the secret society "No Ma'am."

12:50.240 --> 12:54.791
National Organization of Men
Against Amazonian Masterhood.

13:02.720 --> 13:06.793
I would reveal my true identity,
but for political reasons, I cannot.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.519
But do not take me lightly.

13:08.760 --> 13:13.231
I once scored four touchdowns
in a single game for Polk High.

13:13.760 --> 13:17.469
Hey, Daddy once scored
four touchdowns too.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.871
That is Daddy, you mud flap.

13:24.680 --> 13:28.958
And that's Mr. D'Arcy,
and Mr. Anderson and Bob Rooney.

13:29.200 --> 13:33.637
Boy, if Marcie finds out about this
she'll be down there in a second.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.235
Gee, I wonder if she's watching.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.511
Well, I guess so.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.069
Every day for the past 30 years...

13:44.320 --> 13:48.074
...you high-heeled pit bulls
have blamed us for everything.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.197
From not being able
to get into Harvard...

13:50.440 --> 13:53.432
...to not being able
to get into stretch pants.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.477
We've been called "pigs."

13:57.720 --> 13:59.358
We've been called "scum."

13:59.600 --> 14:02.672
We've even been called
"plywood-bottom."

14:06.000 --> 14:08.275
Or at least I have.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.717
Well, we're sick and tired of this.
Now, we have a list of demands.

14:11.960 --> 14:16.351
If these demands are not met we are
going to take this masculine feminist...

14:16.600 --> 14:19.797
...and perform television's
first "sexorcism."

14:27.480 --> 14:29.755
Tell them what that is, Jefferson.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.520
- My name is Hank.
- Oh, right.

14:34.280 --> 14:37.272
- Sorry, Hank.
- That's okay, Al.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.632
Anyway...

14:42.240 --> 14:44.231
...if our demands go unheeded...

14:44.480 --> 14:49.076
...not only will we force Jerry
to watch hours of pro wrestling...

14:49.320 --> 14:52.790
...but we'll force him
to watch it in these.

14:53.040 --> 14:56.350
A stinky, yellowed undershirt...

14:56.880 --> 14:59.314
...and a pair of boxers which read:

14:59.560 --> 15:02.950
"It's all me."

15:06.880 --> 15:10.156
"It's all me" boxers,
courtesy of Mr. Bob Rooney.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.118
I mean, Dirk Rooney.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.079
Back to you, Al... Clyde.

15:15.320 --> 15:16.594
Hell.

15:16.840 --> 15:18.273
Demand one:

15:18.520 --> 15:20.158
You gals want a ladies' night?

15:20.400 --> 15:23.073
Try having it in the kitchen,
cooking for a man.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.908
Demand two:

15:29.160 --> 15:31.720
Don't put on a dress and ask us
if it makes you look fat.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.638
We hate that.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.715
Besides, it's not the dress
that makes you look fat.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.793
It's the fat that makes you look fat.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.594
Demand three:

15:45.840 --> 15:48.877
Don't ask us to talk
or cuddle after sex.

15:49.120 --> 15:53.910
Or before sex, or during sex.
You're lucky we take our pants off.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.190
You take your pants off?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.309
How do you get them
over your shoes?

16:00.920 --> 16:02.319
Demand four:

16:02.560 --> 16:05.597
Don't ask us to say I love you
over the phone.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.512
It's hard enough to say to someone...

16:07.720 --> 16:10.393
...we're paying a dollar
a minute to talk to.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.192
Demand five:
Stop talking about Fabio.

16:15.440 --> 16:19.069
Yeah. With his long, flowing
blond hair and 48-inch chest...

16:19.320 --> 16:23.074
...we're the ones
who should be talking about...

16:24.400 --> 16:26.994
Anyway, those are our five demands.

16:27.240 --> 16:28.593
We had five more written down...

16:28.840 --> 16:31.957
...but somebody couldn't
blow his nose without a hanky.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.558
So, ladies, you've got 30 minutes...

16:34.800 --> 16:38.031
Which, of course,
is two hours in woman's time.

16:39.480 --> 16:42.517
- to address these demands,
or we'll...

16:42.760 --> 16:44.034
We'll...

16:48.760 --> 16:51.149
- Ready.
- Break!

16:52.640 --> 16:55.234
Or we'll go for burgers.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.870
It didn't make any sense, did it?
Wait a minute.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.152
What about Berkowitz?

17:06.400 --> 17:08.834
We could change our name to that.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.551
- No.
- Can't spell it.

17:14.440 --> 17:17.079
Let's see, what about...?
What about Borden?

17:17.319 --> 17:19.231
Can't spell that either.

17:19.880 --> 17:23.429
- What can you spell?
- Cat.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.315
So let's go to the K's.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.755
Now, I don't want everyone to think...

17:33.000 --> 17:35.150
...that we at No Ma'am
are totally anti-woman...

17:35.360 --> 17:38.796
...so we found a typical working
woman. I'd like to introduce her to you.

17:39.040 --> 17:43.511
Coming live to you from the Club
Squish, Miss Bubbles Double Dee.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.117
Ms. Dee.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.439
You're a working woman.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.671
What do you think of Roe v. Wade?

18:02.120 --> 18:04.395
Gee, I don't know
that much about boxing.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.677
But I'd like to go out to dinner
with whoever wins.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.189
Let's take some questions
from our audience, shall we?

18:14.440 --> 18:15.873
All right.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.750
Would you jump up and down?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.838
Yes.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.480
All right, next question.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.110
Can you do that again?

18:33.160 --> 18:35.196
I'll try.

18:40.440 --> 18:44.752
All right, all right, all right.
Now there, a typical working woman.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.878
Al Bundy, you sloth.

18:48.120 --> 18:52.159
You toad. You two-toed sloth.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.834
This is no man.

18:55.080 --> 18:58.311
This is Al "Oink Oink" Bundy.

18:58.720 --> 19:03.111
Why the mask, Al? Take it off.
Let the world see your snout.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.590
You call yourself a...

19:06.800 --> 19:08.711
Stop it.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.076
You call yourself a man,
but you're a coward.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.596
- You're all cowards.
- Yeah!

19:17.560 --> 19:19.437
- Honey, did you shut off the phone?
- Yes.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.750
- Stop the mail?
- Yup.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.195
- Did you cancel the newspaper?
- Yes.

19:24.680 --> 19:28.116
But won't the D'Arcy's be mad?
I mean, it's their paper.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.873
Honey, the D'Arcy's
have bigger problems.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.509
All right, Bud and Kelly Kat.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.599
Let's go.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.839
The Kat family.

19:41.080 --> 19:44.470
Good choice, you blond airhead.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.036
Mom, do you know
where we're gonna live?

19:48.240 --> 19:52.119
No. But wherever it is
at least we'll be together...

19:52.360 --> 19:54.351
...unless I can find someplace great.

19:56.560 --> 20:01.076
Now, about your demand
to not talk during sex?

20:01.320 --> 20:03.231
The only reason we ask you to...

20:03.480 --> 20:06.392
...is so that we know
when you're finished.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.159
Oh, yeah? Well...

20:11.440 --> 20:15.399
- You're a chicken.
- Yeah!

20:18.840 --> 20:21.912
And if it's true we spend
so little time in the kitchen...

20:22.160 --> 20:25.516
...then how come you spend
so much time in the bathroom?

20:26.680 --> 20:28.352
Because...

20:28.600 --> 20:30.272
Because...

20:31.040 --> 20:34.112
...you're a chicken!
- Yeah!

20:38.000 --> 20:40.514
So in conclusion...

20:40.760 --> 20:42.557
...we don't wanna take over
everything...

20:42.800 --> 20:46.588
...we just want equality,
fairness, to be appreciated.

20:46.840 --> 20:51.356
After all, you need us
more than we need you.

20:56.240 --> 20:59.949
You're in No Ma'am's land now, baby.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.513
So let's set the record straight.

21:07.760 --> 21:12.754
You need us jar-opening,
oil-changing, spider-squishing...

21:13.000 --> 21:16.595
...furniture-rearranging men
a lot more than we need you.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.558
Yeah!

21:20.160 --> 21:21.957
All right, you have a point.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.237
There are some occasions
when women do need men.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.357
Yes!

21:27.600 --> 21:29.318
Well, like tonight for instance.

21:29.560 --> 21:32.120
I need some men
so I'm going to call them.

21:32.360 --> 21:33.679
Oh, gentlemen.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.949
You again, Bundy?

21:43.160 --> 21:45.754
Where were you when I got
mugged out in front of my store?

21:46.320 --> 21:50.472
Where were you last week when I
got mugged outside of your store?

21:58.240 --> 22:00.231
Hi, honey. I just wandered in.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.550
- What's happening?
- Get in the car.

22:02.800 --> 22:06.031
- But Al and them made me...
- Get in the car.

22:09.560 --> 22:13.633
Hey, aren't you Jerry Springer,
the masculine feminist?

22:13.880 --> 22:16.030
- Yes, I am.
- Tie him back up.

22:16.240 --> 22:17.719
What the...?

22:21.240 --> 22:23.310
I hate that guy.

22:23.560 --> 22:25.551
This may be the end
of No Ma'am for now...

22:25.800 --> 22:28.394
...but it's not the last
you'll here of it or me.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.871
Peg, kids, come and get me. Please.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.678
Who's that guy?

22:42.920 --> 22:45.036
Oh, he's doing community service.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.518
My eggs, my eggs

22:54.960 --> 22:57.030
Above my legs

22:58.305 --> 23:04.380
