Albuquerque police.
Open the door, please.

00:32.823 --> 00:35.190
Dad, wake up, wake up.
Wake up!

00:38.128 --> 00:39.861
Albuquerque police, open up.

00:39.863 --> 00:42.600
Fuck.

00:43.567 --> 00:46.267
All right, we gotta go.
All right.

00:46.269 --> 00:49.004
Get your shoes on.

00:49.006 --> 00:52.708
Open up.

00:52.710 --> 00:55.043
Piece of shit knocks me around,
then steals my Chanel purse?

00:55.045 --> 00:56.477
That was real fucking Chanel!

00:56.479 --> 00:57.846
I have some Chanel loafers
that I love,

00:57.848 --> 00:59.281
so I totally get it.

00:59.283 --> 01:00.985
Open up, please, right now.

01:03.320 --> 01:05.654
- Why am I doing this?
- Stop asking questions.

01:05.656 --> 01:07.822
That's good. That's good.

01:15.966 --> 01:18.467
- Oh, goddamn it.
- What's happening?

01:18.469 --> 01:20.237
Oh. Goddamn it.

01:21.104 --> 01:22.637
Inside the cover of that Bible,

01:22.639 --> 01:23.938
there's an address in Santa Fe.

01:23.940 --> 01:26.441
- Get in a cab and go there.
- No!

01:26.443 --> 01:28.843
Listen, it's better than
Child Protective Services.

01:28.845 --> 01:30.979
You gotta trust me on that one.

01:30.981 --> 01:32.681
All right, hey, look at me.

01:32.683 --> 01:34.748
I know I'm not the best dad
in the world,

01:34.750 --> 01:36.287
all right, but I love you.

01:39.824 --> 01:41.322
Goddamn it.

01:41.324 --> 01:42.857
Hey!

01:42.859 --> 01:43.925
What the hell was that for?

01:43.927 --> 01:45.893
You fucked everything up!

01:57.240 --> 01:59.107
Get down on the ground!
Down on the ground!

01:59.109 --> 02:01.009
I'm not resisting!
I'm not resisting!

02:32.776 --> 02:36.510
Oh, hello!
And good morning.

02:36.512 --> 02:39.579
Have you never been invited
to a ranchero breakfast?

02:39.581 --> 02:43.418
Well, my friends, on this
glorious day, you are in luck.

02:43.420 --> 02:45.453
- Because we...
- Are you okay?

02:45.455 --> 02:46.520
You're leaning.

02:46.522 --> 02:47.923
It's a Western saddle.

02:47.925 --> 02:49.623
I can't sit forward
like the English.

02:49.625 --> 02:52.727
Cowboys sit back on their
haunches up against the cantle.

02:52.729 --> 02:54.329
Oh! Ugh!

02:54.331 --> 02:55.933
Oh, God.

03:00.403 --> 03:02.503
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I think so.

03:02.505 --> 03:05.240
You know, we don't have to do
the scene on horseback.

03:05.242 --> 03:07.341
I want to.
It's... it's important.

03:07.343 --> 03:09.978
It adds to the masculinity.
It adds to the grandeur.

03:09.980 --> 03:11.746
Well, that's true.

03:11.748 --> 03:13.215
- Are you being facetious?
- Mm-hmm.

03:13.217 --> 03:15.584
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

03:15.586 --> 03:16.785
Thank you so much.

03:16.787 --> 03:19.821
You are a gentleman.
You really are.

03:19.823 --> 03:22.557
God knows they're in short
supply around here.

03:22.559 --> 03:23.891
Oh, my God.

03:23.893 --> 03:25.492
Would you quit flirting
with him?

03:25.494 --> 03:27.395
It makes him feel awkward,
and he's straight.

03:27.397 --> 03:30.733
No, it makes you feel awkward,
and he's gay.

03:30.735 --> 03:32.266
Well, it makes everyone
feel awkward

03:32.268 --> 03:34.836
watching you act
like a weird old woman.

03:34.838 --> 03:37.104
No, <i>you're</i> a weird
old woman.

03:37.106 --> 03:38.906
You want
to know something?

03:38.908 --> 03:43.079
I could've worked for
Rachel Ray, and she's nice.

03:45.381 --> 03:47.948
How about we just take it
from the first line?

03:47.950 --> 03:49.450
I'd be delighted.

03:49.452 --> 03:51.453
All right,
everyone back to one.

03:59.595 --> 04:01.297
Step aside, son.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.460
This is a Basque oven paddle

04:32.462 --> 04:35.297
that I have repurposed
as a tapas tray.

04:35.299 --> 04:37.866
I like to serve
my stuffed paquillo peppers

04:37.868 --> 04:39.734
on the back of a horse.

04:39.736 --> 04:45.205
Mind you, a vaquero breakfast
needn't be on a vast rancho.

04:45.207 --> 04:47.409
When we return,
I'll show you how you can cook

04:47.411 --> 04:51.780
some of this gorgeous food
in your own little kitchen.

04:51.782 --> 04:53.047
Ciao.

04:53.049 --> 04:55.116
Dig in, amigos.

04:55.118 --> 04:57.451
Manny, you old cock hound.
I didn't see you there.

04:57.453 --> 05:00.487
You can't say "cock hound"
on basic cable.

05:00.489 --> 05:01.925
Cut.

05:02.825 --> 05:06.160
Get rid of
the terra-cotta pots. Yuck.

05:06.162 --> 05:08.328
Ditto the galvanized tin.

05:08.330 --> 05:12.333
Please, please remove the ghastly
bandannas from the goblets.

05:12.335 --> 05:16.672
You, young man, put your camera
there pointing that way.

05:16.674 --> 05:18.039
Look at him.

05:18.041 --> 05:19.907
He's like
the gay Butch Cassidy

05:19.909 --> 05:21.609
except not Butch.

05:21.611 --> 05:25.547
If only we had a producer
who understood that objects

05:25.549 --> 05:27.049
exist in a space.

05:27.051 --> 05:28.282
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

05:28.284 --> 05:29.885
If only you came
to production meetings

05:29.887 --> 05:31.753
to communicate
your ideas in advance.

05:31.755 --> 05:34.321
Oh, but that would cut
into your rigorous drinking

05:34.323 --> 05:36.023
and masturbation schedule.

05:37.126 --> 05:38.760
Do you guys do this at home?

05:38.762 --> 05:41.899
Oh, no, we don't get along
this well at home.

05:42.832 --> 05:44.698
Why don't you leave him?

05:44.700 --> 05:46.267
I probably will.

05:46.269 --> 05:47.669
But, you know,
part of me wants

05:47.671 --> 05:49.837
to stick around
just to watch him die.

06:02.852 --> 06:05.886
Oh, can we call a truce?

06:05.888 --> 06:07.321
Yes.

06:07.323 --> 06:08.623
Thank you.

06:08.625 --> 06:10.325
Finally.

06:10.327 --> 06:11.525
Finally?

06:11.527 --> 06:14.128
When have you ever
called for a truce?

06:14.130 --> 06:17.232
You realize you're starting
an argument about a truce.

06:17.234 --> 06:21.936
I think you are manipulative
and passive-aggressive,

06:21.938 --> 06:23.304
and the truce starts now.

06:23.306 --> 06:29.112
Ah! My favorite Mexicans.
<i>Me llamo Mexico.</i>

06:45.794 --> 06:48.395
So we just got back
from Machu Picchu,

06:48.397 --> 06:50.765
and there's nothing there.
Not impressed. Not impressed.

06:50.767 --> 06:52.267
It just looks like
the Flintstones village.

06:52.269 --> 06:53.835
I'm like, "This is it?
This is it?"

06:53.837 --> 06:56.169
- Not impressed. Zero stars.
- What do you like?

06:56.171 --> 06:58.106
I like Epcot.

06:58.108 --> 07:01.075
Bobby Flay,
I like him as a person.

07:01.077 --> 07:02.410
You know he's
one of my best friends.

07:02.412 --> 07:04.611
No, no,
no don't get me wrong.

07:04.613 --> 07:06.347
He's got a wonderful face

07:06.349 --> 07:10.251
- and, you know...
- marvelous chutzpah.

07:10.253 --> 07:12.520
Are you from LA?

07:12.522 --> 07:13.688
I'm the mayor.

07:13.690 --> 07:14.821
Wait, what?

07:14.823 --> 07:18.126
- Of Santa Fe.
- Oh, I love that.

07:18.128 --> 07:20.695
This close
to the border of Syria.

07:20.697 --> 07:22.028
You can hear the gunfire.

07:22.030 --> 07:24.366
You hear people screaming.
Terrifying.

07:24.368 --> 07:27.268
But the za'atar chicken

07:27.270 --> 07:28.770
was the best I've ever had.

07:28.772 --> 07:30.804
- Mouthwatering.
- And the screaming children

07:30.806 --> 07:32.174
didn't bother
the food at all?

07:32.176 --> 07:35.008
- Apples and oranges.
- You got to eat.

07:35.010 --> 07:36.109
It's the city of holy faith...

07:36.111 --> 07:37.611
- Oh.
- Santa Fe.

07:37.613 --> 07:40.616
That's so cool.
I love that.

07:42.152 --> 07:43.585
And I'm like, "Hey, asshole,

07:43.587 --> 07:46.087
the fucking Dalai Lama
gave me that purse."

07:48.090 --> 07:52.027
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join me in a toast

07:52.029 --> 07:55.196
to two of the finest
hosts in Santa Fe.

07:55.198 --> 07:57.698
What am I talking about?
The world.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.133
Paul, Erasmus.

07:59.135 --> 08:01.369
And if I may interrupt there,
Mr. Mayor,

08:01.371 --> 08:03.772
let's not forget
all the little people,

08:03.774 --> 08:06.407
all the worker bees
out there whoever they are.

08:06.409 --> 08:08.910
- The little people.
- Hear, hear.

08:08.912 --> 08:10.344
Well put.

08:10.346 --> 08:13.481
I am with such an asshole.

08:13.483 --> 08:15.982
I love an asshole.
So to speak.

08:17.921 --> 08:19.119
Cheers to that.

08:19.121 --> 08:20.621
- Cheers to that!
- Double cheers!

09:00.328 --> 09:03.130
I mean, it is Santa Fe, right?
It's a little on the nose.

09:03.132 --> 09:05.532
I just get sick
of all the turquoise.

09:05.534 --> 09:07.100
It gets a little over...
I mean, no disrespect.

09:07.102 --> 09:08.603
- You look great.
- Thanks.

09:08.605 --> 09:11.540
Yeah.
Oh, hello, who are you?

09:11.542 --> 09:13.177
Um...

09:16.112 --> 09:19.582
Oh. Erasmus.

09:21.150 --> 09:23.151
Well, someone can't spell
my name.

09:23.153 --> 09:27.124
"Dear Arosmus.
This is your grandson."

09:29.292 --> 09:32.659
Is... Is your father here?

09:32.661 --> 09:35.330
Was he here?
Has he gone? Wh...?

09:35.332 --> 09:39.736
What's your name?
Um, do you have a name?

09:42.438 --> 09:44.638
Um, can we get
another chair, please?

09:44.640 --> 09:47.173
Please.

09:47.175 --> 09:49.378
Is that all you have
with you?

09:51.880 --> 09:54.150
Well, we've got a Bible.

09:55.084 --> 10:00.388
Some cash.
And a bag of cocaine.

10:00.390 --> 10:01.556
Hmm.

10:01.558 --> 10:02.923
All anyone really
needs in life, eh?

10:02.925 --> 10:05.893
No clothes, I see.

10:05.895 --> 10:08.662
I'll call the store.
They're about to close.

10:08.664 --> 10:11.235
Oh. Oh, good.

10:14.102 --> 10:16.171
Um, everyone,
it would appear

10:16.173 --> 10:19.543
this little chap
is my grandson.

10:22.145 --> 10:24.579
The truth is,
Sandy Koufax had a huge dong.

10:24.581 --> 10:26.580
- Really?
- Huge dong. Legendary.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.983
- Legendarily huge dong.
- Is that true?

10:28.985 --> 10:30.585
That is true. For a Jew.

10:30.587 --> 10:31.788
Excuse me.

10:32.789 --> 10:34.888
You have a grandson?

10:34.890 --> 10:36.391
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

10:36.393 --> 10:40.295
I mean, look.
I've had no work done.

10:40.297 --> 10:42.396
I only found out you had
a son a few years ago.

10:42.398 --> 10:44.831
He's estranged.
I told you about him.

10:44.833 --> 10:46.234
No, not really.

10:46.236 --> 10:49.003
Well, back in the '80s
when I was experimenting,

10:49.005 --> 10:54.642
I had a liaison with a woman
which resulted in a baby...

10:54.644 --> 10:57.411
yuck...
which she wanted to keep.

10:57.413 --> 11:00.348
And... This is
all very murky.

11:00.350 --> 11:02.249
I was probably off my tits
on Quaaludes.

11:02.251 --> 11:05.485
Remember them?
What a blast.

11:05.487 --> 11:10.490
Anywho, before you came along,
darling, I had a son called Bo

11:10.492 --> 11:12.860
who dropped out of school,
developed a drug problem.

11:12.862 --> 11:15.763
He even OD'ed at my book launch
in New York.

11:15.765 --> 11:17.831
No. How embarrassing
for you.

11:17.833 --> 11:20.167
Well, it was.
Anna Wintour was there.

11:20.169 --> 11:21.835
Wait.
Where's the father?

11:21.837 --> 11:24.339
According to the note,
he's in jail.

11:24.341 --> 11:25.706
Yes, he's in jail.

11:25.708 --> 11:30.043
- So he's moving in?
- Just keep an eye on him.

11:30.045 --> 11:31.579
We can't have a kid.

11:31.581 --> 11:33.013
We couldn't even handle
that little rat bastard

11:33.015 --> 11:34.114
Yorkshire Terrier.

11:34.116 --> 11:35.483
Thank God for that coyote.

11:35.485 --> 11:37.018
Problem solved,
but a kid's too much.

11:37.020 --> 11:39.553
Calm down, I'm sure someone
from Social Services

11:39.555 --> 11:41.489
will turn up on the doorstep
and tell us where we stand.

11:41.491 --> 11:42.824
Just take one of your pills.

11:42.826 --> 11:44.291
Why don't you take
one of your pills?

11:44.293 --> 11:45.627
That reminds me.

11:45.629 --> 11:47.128
What are we going
to do about this?

11:47.130 --> 11:49.129
I mean,
I don't do cocaine anymore,

11:49.131 --> 11:50.931
but it seems such
a dreadful waste.

11:50.933 --> 11:53.433
We could put it in one
of Tatyana's charity auctions.

11:53.435 --> 11:55.201
- Perfect.
- I'm kidding.

11:55.203 --> 11:57.172
We'd go to jail.

11:57.174 --> 12:00.309
Oh.
Do you want a blow job?

12:02.411 --> 12:06.413
- We have guests.
- Yes, you're right.

12:06.415 --> 12:08.550
Have a good night, guys.
Thanks so much.

12:08.552 --> 12:12.586
Hey. So people are going
so you can deal with the kid.

12:12.588 --> 12:13.988
No. Don't go, Kate.

12:13.990 --> 12:16.356
No. I have a bleaching
in the morning.

12:16.358 --> 12:17.660
For my teeth.

12:19.629 --> 12:21.995
Everyone is leaving.

12:21.997 --> 12:24.565
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

12:24.567 --> 12:26.066
Just tell us
what you want,

12:26.068 --> 12:27.569
and someone will make it
for you.

12:27.571 --> 12:29.036
I want Taco Bell.

12:29.038 --> 12:30.970
Let's just go to the kitchen.
Maybe we can...

12:30.972 --> 12:32.340
Don't touch me!

12:32.342 --> 12:33.740
It's all right.
It's okay.

12:33.742 --> 12:36.511
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

12:36.513 --> 12:38.879
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

12:38.881 --> 12:40.782
Okay, would you
nut up for second?

12:40.784 --> 12:42.550
Here's what
you're going to do.

12:42.552 --> 12:44.252
You're going to get
the mayor a shot of mescal.

12:44.254 --> 12:45.952
You're going to ask the editor
of <i>El Decor</i> to dance.

12:45.954 --> 12:47.754
I'm going to tell Gustavo
to play some tangos

12:47.756 --> 12:50.425
and get Tino to take
that feral child the Taco Bell.

12:50.427 --> 12:52.060
Then you're going to go
to the front door,

12:52.062 --> 12:53.360
tell everybody to come back

12:53.362 --> 12:54.762
because you got me
a birthday cake,

12:54.764 --> 12:56.464
we're going to sing,
and there's cocaine.

12:56.466 --> 12:59.403
Yes, but I haven't,
and it's not your birthday.

13:00.535 --> 13:02.836
It is your birthday.

13:02.838 --> 13:04.971
Go. Go. Go.

13:04.973 --> 13:06.141
Hey, everyone!

13:06.143 --> 13:08.643
I've got cocaine
and birthday cake!

13:35.038 --> 13:38.773
Well, this would be
the point where you say,

13:38.775 --> 13:42.310
"Erasmus, it's <i>marvelous!"</i>

13:42.312 --> 13:45.916
It's like staying
at a five-star resort!

13:47.016 --> 13:49.550
I look like
a fucking asshole in these.

13:49.552 --> 13:52.320
All right, come on.

13:52.322 --> 13:54.725
Bedtime. Let's go.

13:59.696 --> 14:01.528
Lights on or off?

14:01.530 --> 14:03.397
I don't care.

14:03.399 --> 14:05.099
Hey, hey...

14:05.101 --> 14:06.367
Never say that.

14:06.369 --> 14:08.002
You should always
care passionately

14:08.004 --> 14:11.942
about every single choice
you make in your life.

14:15.845 --> 14:17.581
Good night.

14:19.348 --> 14:20.681
We're locking our doors.

14:20.683 --> 14:22.917
That kid scares
the shit out of me.

14:22.919 --> 14:25.387
- Oh, I think he's sweet.
- Really?

14:25.389 --> 14:26.921
Well, people thought
Jeffrey Dahmer was sweet

14:26.923 --> 14:28.989
till he raped them
and ate them.

14:28.991 --> 14:30.758
Ew.

14:30.760 --> 14:33.561
I'm sure it's just
a temporary arrangement.

14:33.563 --> 14:35.562
What if it's not?

14:35.564 --> 14:40.468
Well, would that be
such a bad thing?

14:40.470 --> 14:43.604
My parents were
such drunkaholic messes.

14:43.606 --> 14:45.940
I was 11 years old before
I realized my father's name

14:45.942 --> 14:47.974
wasn't
"that fucking bastard."

14:47.976 --> 14:51.678
Heh. You told me
that joke before.

14:51.680 --> 14:55.449
I'm so sorry. I'll try
and work on some new material.

14:55.451 --> 14:57.551
Thank you.

14:57.553 --> 14:58.985
They were terrible parents,

14:58.987 --> 15:00.687
and I don't want
to be a terrible parent.

15:00.689 --> 15:05.158
- No one's asking you to be.
- Oh, God.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.228
I feel like I'm going to have
one of my things.

15:07.230 --> 15:09.663
- What things?
- My panic things.

15:09.665 --> 15:13.868
I shouldn't have done blow.
I'm such a douchebag.

15:13.870 --> 15:17.338
- Well, take one of your pills.
- I did.

15:17.340 --> 15:21.008
You know, the editor
of El Decor was dancing

15:21.010 --> 15:22.575
like her
life depended on it.

15:22.577 --> 15:23.945
If she'd gone home early,

15:23.947 --> 15:25.613
the party would've been
a disaster.

15:25.615 --> 15:28.181
We should check in,
make sure everything's okay.

15:28.183 --> 15:30.183
What, with the editor?

15:30.185 --> 15:31.451
Hmm? No, the kid.

15:31.453 --> 15:33.421
Oh, he'll be fast asleep.

15:33.423 --> 15:34.755
We should check in,

15:34.757 --> 15:37.092
make sure
he hasn't stolen anything.

15:41.664 --> 15:43.500
What the hell?

15:51.140 --> 15:53.941
Hey, kid?
What's his name again?

15:53.943 --> 15:56.844
I told you a dozen times,
I don't know.

15:56.846 --> 15:59.816
Kid! K...

16:00.850 --> 16:02.683
Should I call the police?

16:02.685 --> 16:05.719
No, it's okay,
they're all here. They're safe.

16:05.721 --> 16:08.723
No, not because of your
kachina doll collection.

16:08.725 --> 16:13.597
- Because the kid is missing.
- Oh. Paul.

16:16.499 --> 16:18.666
Maybe one of us
should take the car into town

16:18.668 --> 16:20.801
- and have a look around.
- Meaning me?

16:20.803 --> 16:23.671
Well, one of us
has got to stay here.

16:23.673 --> 16:25.241
Meaning you?

16:33.249 --> 16:35.185
Erasmus.

16:40.689 --> 16:42.989
Thank God.

16:42.991 --> 16:46.228
I need a drink.
Oh, God.

16:52.034 --> 16:54.369
Hey.

16:54.371 --> 16:55.569
Hey, hey.

16:55.571 --> 16:57.671
It's okay.

16:57.673 --> 17:00.206
You gave us a scare, kid.

17:00.208 --> 17:02.678
Get away from me, you fag.

17:10.486 --> 17:12.019
So what'd the lawyer say?

17:12.021 --> 17:14.355
Nothing, really, just that
the father is in custody,

17:14.357 --> 17:16.256
the mother is dead,
and they're gonna send

17:16.258 --> 17:17.992
someone round
from Social Services.

17:17.993 --> 17:20.861
We can't have a kid.
We don't like kids.

17:20.863 --> 17:23.731
Stop calling him a kid.
He's a child. A kid a baby goat.

17:23.733 --> 17:25.898
I'd rather have a baby goat.
Baby goats are cute.

17:25.901 --> 17:29.639
Baby goats won't come and visit
you when you're old and lonely.

17:30.739 --> 17:32.639
Besides, didn't you organize
that Mexican

17:32.641 --> 17:34.140
children charity
or something?

17:34.142 --> 17:36.610
Look, I love helping
children in the abstract,

17:36.612 --> 17:38.878
but I don't want one
in the house.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.214
Hmm.

17:40.216 --> 17:41.948
Well, at any rate, we have
to send it to school.

17:41.950 --> 17:43.817
- Really?
- Yeah, it's the law.

17:43.819 --> 17:47.253
And it gets him out
of the house for the day.

18:05.541 --> 18:06.607
Hello.

18:06.609 --> 18:08.007
Oh, hello.

18:08.009 --> 18:10.244
We would like to enroll
this young man.

18:10.246 --> 18:14.817
All right.
And what is his name?

18:22.492 --> 18:24.694
Would you excuse us,
please?

18:30.666 --> 18:35.936
Oh, I see you've discovered
one of my favorite contraptions.

18:35.938 --> 18:40.507
These are such fun.
Let's have a look.

18:40.509 --> 18:44.678
Hmm. You might want to vary
your expression a bit.

18:44.680 --> 18:48.651
Scoot along.
Join in with me if you like.

18:49.884 --> 18:52.552
I like to do one happy...

18:52.554 --> 18:54.888
one angry...

18:54.890 --> 18:57.891
one silly...

18:57.893 --> 18:59.693
and one just looking off
into the middle distance,

18:59.695 --> 19:02.866
thinking
about something.

19:06.169 --> 19:08.838
Now we've got
a bit of an awkward wait.

19:11.907 --> 19:16.842
Oh, look at those.
We're hilarious.

19:16.844 --> 19:18.411
What would you like
to do now?

19:38.534 --> 19:40.402
Having a party?

19:41.536 --> 19:43.840
No.

20:28.217 --> 20:31.051
And where have <i>you</i> been?

20:31.053 --> 20:33.186
Ugh. In the editing room.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.888
Trying to make something viable

20:34.890 --> 20:38.260
out of your insane
on-camera ramblings.

20:39.894 --> 20:45.698
Paul, do you know that
huge store called Way Mart

20:45.700 --> 20:48.034
or Mall Mart,
something on Cirrillos?

20:48.036 --> 20:50.937
Yeah, of course. It's owned
by some crazy conservatives.

20:50.939 --> 20:52.105
You shouldn't shop there.

20:52.107 --> 20:54.808
I thought it was nirvana.

20:54.810 --> 20:56.878
Everything was so inexpensive.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.579
The effect was intoxicating.

20:58.581 --> 21:02.081
As intoxicating as that
giant tumbler of tequila?

21:02.083 --> 21:05.988
Yes.
But in a different way.

21:07.122 --> 21:09.322
- He should be in bed.
- Why?

21:09.324 --> 21:11.826
Because it's 2:00
in the morning.

21:11.828 --> 21:13.226
He doesn't have school
in the morning.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.428
I know, because
we haven't enrolled him

21:15.430 --> 21:17.997
because we don't know
his name.

21:17.999 --> 21:19.734
Have a tequila.

21:19.736 --> 21:22.069
Oh. I'm so tired.

21:22.071 --> 21:25.606
Oh. I'm so tired.

21:31.346 --> 21:33.045
Hey, kid.

21:33.047 --> 21:35.715
I know you're having fun,
but it's very late.

21:35.717 --> 21:38.987
Why don't you turn off the TV?
Let's get you to bed.

21:40.622 --> 21:42.389
Thanks, buddy.

21:42.391 --> 21:44.193
Mañana, piranha.

21:49.631 --> 21:52.300
Are you mad at me?

21:52.302 --> 21:54.169
Paul?

22:00.442 --> 22:05.811
Getting a nightcap?

22:05.813 --> 22:08.117
Some tea.

22:13.022 --> 22:16.391
Did you see the photo
for the dust jacket?

22:18.861 --> 22:21.161
Yes, I did.

22:21.163 --> 22:23.198
What do you think?

22:25.567 --> 22:27.201
This is why you need me.

22:27.203 --> 22:30.937
You really, really should have
let me look over these

22:30.939 --> 22:32.671
before you chose the cover,

22:32.673 --> 22:39.112
because you look like
a person with a mental handicap.

22:39.114 --> 22:44.319
No creature smiles <i>this</i> hard
in all of nature.

22:46.854 --> 22:50.323
I do.
When you make me laugh.

22:50.325 --> 22:53.395
Oh.

22:54.196 --> 22:55.529
That was cruel.

22:57.265 --> 23:01.137
The kettle's boiling.
So to speak.

23:04.806 --> 23:07.476
Fuck the tea.

23:09.411 --> 23:10.543
Yay.

23:20.622 --> 23:21.888
Well, hello.

23:21.890 --> 23:23.323
I assume the kid
got to you okay.

23:23.325 --> 23:26.292
Yes. Yes, he's here
with me now.

23:26.294 --> 23:27.661
You brought him here?

23:27.663 --> 23:29.396
Yes, of course.
He wants to see you.

23:29.398 --> 23:31.865
What, are you insane?
He can't see me like this.

23:31.867 --> 23:34.601
Don't be ridiculous.

23:34.603 --> 23:36.471
Want a Rolo?

23:40.676 --> 23:42.475
That's littering.

23:42.477 --> 23:43.642
So?

23:43.644 --> 23:46.746
So, we don't do that.

23:46.748 --> 23:48.083
Pick it up.

23:49.185 --> 23:51.187
Pick it up.

23:58.727 --> 24:01.428
Don't bring him back here. It's
gonna screw him up in the head.

24:01.430 --> 24:03.664
Like every decision
you haven't made already

24:03.666 --> 24:04.898
hasn't screwed him up.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.266
Hey, I don't need any shit
from you.

24:06.268 --> 24:07.834
You're going to take it,
young man,

24:07.836 --> 24:09.637
because Paul and I
are looking after your child.

24:09.639 --> 24:13.205
- Who is Paul?
- Paul is my male companion,

24:13.207 --> 24:16.275
and he has been
for the last 10 years.

24:16.277 --> 24:17.944
You have the problem
with that?

24:17.946 --> 24:20.149
No.

24:20.916 --> 24:23.082
Oh.
Well, anyway,

24:23.084 --> 24:24.317
we brought him here

24:24.319 --> 24:26.219
so that
you could see each other

24:26.221 --> 24:27.821
and to reassure you
that he's being

24:27.823 --> 24:30.659
well taken care of
in your absence.

24:33.128 --> 24:34.927
You're welcome.

24:34.929 --> 24:37.398
What would I thank you for?

24:37.400 --> 24:39.331
Where were you
when I was 10 years old?

24:39.333 --> 24:40.634
I could've used you then.

24:40.636 --> 24:41.968
And now you come back here

24:41.970 --> 24:43.637
with your scarf
around your neck and think

24:43.639 --> 24:44.704
you're saving the day?

24:44.706 --> 24:46.372
It's called kerchief.

24:46.374 --> 24:47.840
You're not the hero of me

24:47.842 --> 24:49.042
and my son's story, all right?

24:49.044 --> 24:51.380
You're a last resort.

24:52.313 --> 24:55.215
Wait. What's his name?

24:56.384 --> 24:57.584
I wrote it in the Bible.

24:57.586 --> 24:59.388
Wait. What?

25:05.861 --> 25:08.428
So, it turns out
the county

25:08.430 --> 25:11.631
won't allow visits
from children today.

25:11.633 --> 25:13.132
But the lady out front
said that it was...

25:13.134 --> 25:16.403
Without
additional paperwork.

25:16.405 --> 25:19.142
Oh.

25:20.275 --> 25:22.576
I have a great idea.

25:22.578 --> 25:24.476
Why don't we go
to a video arcade

25:24.478 --> 25:27.380
- and then get some ice cream?
- Yeah.

25:27.382 --> 25:30.451
Or we could go to
the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum,

25:30.453 --> 25:33.289
and afterwards
have a nice salad.

25:34.823 --> 25:36.689
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Fuck you!

25:36.691 --> 25:39.193
- You saw that, didn't you?!
- Nice shot! Nice shot!

25:39.195 --> 25:42.696
Yes!

25:56.378 --> 25:58.779
Excuse me... sweetheart.

25:58.781 --> 26:02.349
We don't fold throws.
It's too fussy.

26:02.351 --> 26:03.849
We want it be more casual,

26:03.851 --> 26:08.155
so we drape it
like a woman reclining, thus.

26:08.157 --> 26:09.723
Yes, you mustn't make it
seem as if you put

26:09.725 --> 26:11.724
- too much thought into it.
- Exactly so.

26:11.726 --> 26:13.927
It shouldn't look like
it's been placed there.

26:13.929 --> 26:15.596
- It should look like it's...
- Just appeared.

26:15.598 --> 26:17.230
- Yes, like a...
- Cyst.

26:17.232 --> 26:19.567
- ...rainbow or a...
- Cancer cell.

26:19.569 --> 26:21.501
Wildflower.

26:21.503 --> 26:24.070
- Perfect.
- That's wrong.

26:24.072 --> 26:27.209
Excuse us.
Uh. Excuse me.

26:28.176 --> 26:30.810
Look, the Bible.

26:30.812 --> 26:33.647
Hmm.

26:33.649 --> 26:35.349
From Bo, remember?
He said he left a note.

26:35.351 --> 26:37.951
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I thought you'd found God.

26:37.953 --> 26:41.754
Um, "It's Bo. Remember me?
This is grandson.

26:41.756 --> 26:45.591
"Mother is dead.
I got trouble/jail.

26:45.593 --> 26:48.328
Take care of him.
He's Angel."

26:48.330 --> 26:51.197
He's really got something
against articles of speech.

26:51.199 --> 26:52.198
Angel...

26:56.205 --> 26:58.407
Is your name Angel?

27:01.275 --> 27:02.909
Why didn't you tell us?

27:05.813 --> 27:07.813
I don't like it.

27:07.815 --> 27:09.015
No one likes their name.

27:09.017 --> 27:10.317
No, can you imagine
how I felt

27:10.319 --> 27:11.752
on my first day at school
when the teacher

27:11.754 --> 27:13.453
called out
a Erasmus Dickey Brumble?

27:13.455 --> 27:16.391
- What's wrong with Angel?
- It's gay.

27:17.258 --> 27:18.725
It is a little gay.

27:18.727 --> 27:20.627
What would you like
to be called?

27:20.629 --> 27:22.029
Bill.

27:22.031 --> 27:24.130
Then Bill you shall be.

27:24.132 --> 27:26.632
You can't just change his name
because he wants to change it.

27:26.634 --> 27:29.069
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?

27:29.071 --> 27:32.973
All right, fine, Bill it is.
But one question.

27:32.975 --> 27:35.376
Why didn't you just tell us
you wanted to be called Bill

27:35.378 --> 27:36.510
from the outset?

27:36.512 --> 27:38.344
Because I just thought of it.

27:38.346 --> 27:40.580
I've been trying
to think of a name.

27:40.582 --> 27:42.049
What difference does it make?

27:42.051 --> 27:45.051
It makes a difference
because for two weeks,

27:45.053 --> 27:46.186
we've been calling him "kid"

27:46.188 --> 27:47.486
and we haven't
put him in school.

27:47.488 --> 27:50.256
No problem, just
from now on, communicate.

27:50.258 --> 27:51.791
Yeah, communicate.

27:51.793 --> 27:53.726
Don't, don't, don't, don't!

27:53.728 --> 27:54.794
Don't do that!

27:54.796 --> 27:56.463
All the fucking time
you do that!

27:56.465 --> 27:58.165
You make me look like an idiot

27:58.167 --> 28:00.867
in front of the crew,
in front of the kid!

28:00.869 --> 28:03.535
The kid's got a name.
He's call...

28:03.537 --> 28:04.870
Sorry, what was your name?

28:04.872 --> 28:06.372
It's Bill!

28:06.374 --> 28:09.076
Uh, Paul?
Paul, wait, we need you.

28:12.547 --> 28:16.449
Well, can you make an exception
in my case?

28:16.451 --> 28:18.952
Perhaps it would make a
difference if I was to tell you

28:18.954 --> 28:22.388
my name was Erasmus Bumble.

28:22.390 --> 28:25.926
I present to cookery program
and... Oh, sod it.

28:25.928 --> 28:29.599
Taco Bell don't deliver.
I can't get a hold of Paul.

28:30.865 --> 28:32.933
Hello, Paul, it's me.

28:32.935 --> 28:35.903
You made your point
quite eloquently.

28:35.905 --> 28:37.471
Please come home.

28:40.476 --> 28:46.045
I have made you cochinita pibil
with homemade tortilla.

28:46.047 --> 28:48.447
I've offered
to make you anything

28:48.449 --> 28:52.321
from the finest ingredients
known to man.

28:53.956 --> 28:55.888
Taco Bell.

28:55.890 --> 28:58.826
Fine.

28:58.828 --> 29:00.426
All right.

29:00.428 --> 29:03.332
Total capitulation.

29:08.871 --> 29:10.372
Shit.

29:11.573 --> 29:14.474
This is raccoon.

29:14.476 --> 29:17.343
It's by the building
that's brown,

29:17.345 --> 29:18.611
and its square,

29:18.613 --> 29:20.747
and it has these
little logs on the roof.

29:20.749 --> 29:23.050
In case you hadn't noticed,

29:23.052 --> 29:27.853
you just described every
fucking building in Santa Fe.

29:27.855 --> 29:28.921
Wait, there it is!

29:28.923 --> 29:31.459
Oh, great.

29:38.501 --> 29:41.100
<i>♪♪ I'm glad we made it
To Taco Bell ♪♪</i>

29:41.102 --> 29:43.305
Come on, come on, come on!

29:45.908 --> 29:48.308
Hi, welcome to Taco Bell.
My name's Leticia.

29:48.310 --> 29:49.642
How can I help you?

29:49.644 --> 29:52.344
Hello, Leticia.
My name is Erasmus.

29:52.346 --> 29:54.981
And this is my grandson Bill.

29:54.983 --> 29:56.683
Can I have the Crunch Wrap
Supreme with bacon

29:56.685 --> 29:58.118
and the Nachos BellGrande?

29:58.120 --> 29:59.785
Sure.

30:01.256 --> 30:04.157
And for you, sir?

30:04.159 --> 30:06.559
I'm sorry,
I am mesmerized

30:06.561 --> 30:11.330
by the divergent culinary
concepts at play here.

30:11.332 --> 30:13.533
Cheesy Gordita Crunch.

30:13.535 --> 30:17.803
Fiery Doritos Locos
Tacos Supreme.

30:17.805 --> 30:20.541
I mean, it's like
Mexican jazz music.

30:20.543 --> 30:23.709
- Are you a Erasmus Brumble?
- I am indeed.

30:23.711 --> 30:25.278
I heard that you called earlier.

30:25.280 --> 30:28.682
I love your books
and your TV show, and, well,

30:28.684 --> 30:30.417
what are you doing here?

30:30.419 --> 30:32.552
Well, if you like my books
and my TV show,

30:32.554 --> 30:33.986
what are <i>you</i> doing here?

30:33.988 --> 30:36.823
Are you going
to order something?

30:36.825 --> 30:39.426
I'd love to see
the wine list first, please.

30:41.630 --> 30:43.765
He wasn't joking.

30:48.269 --> 30:49.468
You like it?

30:49.470 --> 30:53.240
Oh, Bill,
I've seen the light.

30:53.242 --> 30:54.741
What?

30:54.743 --> 30:56.776
Well, have a think.

30:56.778 --> 31:00.015
What's the happiest
you've ever been?

31:02.551 --> 31:05.385
One time with my dad,
he took me to the mountains,

31:05.387 --> 31:06.989
and we shot squirrels.

31:08.323 --> 31:10.991
Hmm.

31:10.993 --> 31:17.597
Well, for me, sitting here
sharing this taco with you,

31:17.599 --> 31:19.769
is <i>that</i> good.

31:25.340 --> 31:29.678
But there's got to be
a better table than this.

31:35.749 --> 31:38.820
How long have you been sitting
alone here in the dark?

31:39.653 --> 31:42.054
Uh... 10 years.

31:42.056 --> 31:44.858
It's been a nightmare
since you've been away.

31:44.860 --> 31:46.826
Bill and I have been
crying our eyes out.

31:46.828 --> 31:50.128
- Isn't that right, Bill?
- No, it was fine.

31:50.130 --> 31:51.598
We went to Taco Bell.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.702
Why don't you trot off to bed,
little man?

31:57.805 --> 32:00.307
We can't have a kid.

32:00.309 --> 32:03.242
We are kids.

32:03.244 --> 32:04.778
Well, that's not true.

32:04.780 --> 32:06.779
You're more of a kid
than me.

32:06.781 --> 32:08.782
Do I have a sense of play?

32:08.784 --> 32:11.118
Oh, uh, <i>yeah.</i>

32:13.421 --> 32:15.088
But you're a man.

32:15.090 --> 32:19.458
You're a great big hulking
Paleolithic beast of a man.

32:19.460 --> 32:22.128
You're talking about my ass.

32:22.130 --> 32:23.629
No.

32:23.631 --> 32:25.831
Look at me.

32:25.833 --> 32:30.972
You have the biggest heart
of any man I know.

33:00.735 --> 33:02.871
Is everything all right?

33:07.342 --> 33:09.274
Yes, everything's fine.

33:09.276 --> 33:11.813
Can I have Chunky Monkey?

33:13.148 --> 33:15.150
Yes, of course.

33:16.317 --> 33:17.850
Where is it?

33:17.852 --> 33:20.086
It's in the freezer
in the kitchen.

33:20.088 --> 33:22.591
There isn't any there.
I looked.

33:23.557 --> 33:25.692
No, it's in the freezer
in the garage!

33:25.694 --> 33:27.159
It's in the garage!

33:27.161 --> 33:29.861
The one with all
the Kevin Costner magnets on it!

33:29.863 --> 33:31.164
Who's Kevin "Coster"?

33:31.166 --> 33:33.000
He was in that film.
What was it called?

33:33.002 --> 33:34.567
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matt...

33:34.569 --> 33:35.936
It's doesn't matter.

33:35.938 --> 33:38.272
It's the only freezer
that's in the garage.

33:38.274 --> 33:39.438
Okay.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.709
Good night.

33:44.246 --> 33:45.444
Do you want some?

33:45.446 --> 33:47.550
No, thank you.

33:48.350 --> 33:50.019
Okay.

33:51.986 --> 33:55.388
Oh, <i>Dances with Wolves!</i>

34:02.930 --> 34:05.167
We gotta make him lunch.

34:07.034 --> 34:09.170
We have to make him lunch.

34:11.773 --> 34:13.943
We have to make him lunch.

34:16.543 --> 34:18.210
<i>Taco Bell.</i>

34:18.213 --> 34:20.612
- Pepperoni pizza.
- No.

34:20.614 --> 34:22.782
Come on, man, look.
It's got...

34:22.784 --> 34:26.952
tongue twisters, jokes,
and more mixed-up fun inside.

34:26.954 --> 34:29.353
No.

34:29.356 --> 34:31.759
Oh, God...

34:34.996 --> 34:36.963
All right.
Last offer.

34:36.965 --> 34:40.998
A 2-pound bag
of Sour Patch Kids for lunch.

34:41.001 --> 34:44.303
Candy is for dessert.

34:44.304 --> 34:46.706
You got all the flavors.

34:46.708 --> 34:48.007
Blue.

34:48.010 --> 34:49.978
Please.

34:58.320 --> 35:01.588
Uh, we're still
serving breakfast.

35:01.590 --> 35:02.821
For how long?

35:02.823 --> 35:05.658
Uh...
Another 45 minutes.

35:05.660 --> 35:07.997
Oh, fuck you.

35:13.869 --> 35:15.401
Has it been
45 minutes yet?

35:15.403 --> 35:18.370
No, it's been two.

35:18.372 --> 35:21.774
I want 20 crunch wraps
with bacon, please.

35:21.776 --> 35:24.611
- Twenty?
- Twenty.

35:24.613 --> 35:25.979
Why'd you get 20 of 'em?

35:25.981 --> 35:27.314
Because I'm gonna freeze them

35:27.316 --> 35:29.651
and then thaw them out
every morning.

35:30.686 --> 35:33.885
That's... not going to work.

35:33.887 --> 35:35.555
And it's weird.

35:35.557 --> 35:38.925
Why can't I just take them
to school in a Taco Bell bag?

35:41.195 --> 35:44.930
Because I've written articles
for <i>Server</i> magazine.

35:44.932 --> 35:48.501
- Do you know what that is?
- No.

35:48.503 --> 35:51.139
Get the fuck out of my car.

36:05.686 --> 36:07.255
Mmm.

36:10.992 --> 36:14.227
So the bartender says,
"No? You don't know?

36:14.229 --> 36:17.396
You walk him
and pitch to the rhino."

36:19.133 --> 36:21.033
Why are you wearing chaps
at dinner?

36:21.035 --> 36:24.070
These used to belong
to Roy Rogers.

36:26.073 --> 36:27.673
- Please.
- Even though

36:27.675 --> 36:29.008
I don't believe
in reincarnation,

36:29.010 --> 36:30.876
I am becoming more
and more convinced

36:30.878 --> 36:33.678
that in a previous life,
I was a cattle rustler.

36:35.284 --> 36:37.249
You just said you don't believe
in reincarnation.

36:37.251 --> 36:39.619
I can rustle cattle.
I roped a steer.

36:39.621 --> 36:41.889
You couldn't rope Ethel Merman.

36:43.392 --> 36:45.892
Bill, do you like the place?

36:45.894 --> 36:47.426
Seriously, tell them
what time you go to bed.

36:47.428 --> 36:48.961
- Whenever I want.
- Oh...

36:48.963 --> 36:52.198
I want Erasmus and Paul
to be my granddaddys.

36:52.200 --> 36:55.635
- You like Erasmus's cooking?
- No, it's gross.

36:57.773 --> 36:59.071
Where is your dad?

36:59.073 --> 37:00.939
He's in jail
for beating up a hooker.

37:02.878 --> 37:04.910
Where does he get this stuff?

37:04.912 --> 37:07.079
He's actually not kidding
about that.

37:07.081 --> 37:08.881
Oh. Heh.

37:08.883 --> 37:13.122
Um, well,
where's your mom?

37:13.921 --> 37:15.720
She was a drug addict.

37:15.722 --> 37:18.226
And she took
too many drugs one night.

37:19.093 --> 37:21.559
And she fell off the balcony.

37:21.561 --> 37:24.365
It was four stories high.

37:32.340 --> 37:34.807
Where were you
when this happened?

37:34.809 --> 37:36.979
In the next room.

37:48.856 --> 37:54.829
Well, the good news
is I've made a pear tart.

38:22.689 --> 38:24.892
Hi.

38:25.827 --> 38:27.359
Hi.

38:27.361 --> 38:28.628
I'm Melissa Enright

38:28.630 --> 38:30.932
with Child Protective Services.

38:32.834 --> 38:36.635
Hi. Hey, come...
come... come on in.

38:36.637 --> 38:39.040
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

38:40.742 --> 38:43.276
This is the first
of several mandated visits

38:43.278 --> 38:45.477
by the CPS of New Mexico.

38:45.479 --> 38:47.012
Fantastic.

38:47.014 --> 38:49.148
When a single parent
is arrested,

38:49.150 --> 38:52.017
there's an inquiry
initiated by CPS.

38:52.019 --> 38:54.820
He's been here
for 10 weeks.

38:54.822 --> 38:56.388
We're backlogged.

38:56.390 --> 38:57.957
So is he here?

38:59.061 --> 39:00.191
Who's that?

39:00.193 --> 39:03.729
Erasmus,
this is, uh...

39:03.731 --> 39:04.997
- Melissa.
- Melissa.

39:04.999 --> 39:07.332
From Child
Protective Services.

39:07.334 --> 39:08.934
Oh, shit.

39:08.936 --> 39:11.505
Uh, hello, Melissa,
I'm Erasmus.

39:13.073 --> 39:15.041
So, yeah, Bill's around.
And you haven't seen...

39:16.276 --> 39:18.211
I don't know.
I just got up.

39:18.213 --> 39:20.012
Is anything wrong?

39:20.014 --> 39:21.347
No, Melissa.

39:21.349 --> 39:24.584
Welcome to our humble
country abode.

39:24.586 --> 39:26.785
I'll just going to put
some coffee on.

39:26.787 --> 39:30.256
Ooh.
It's good coffee.

39:30.258 --> 39:35.428
Yes, also good
if we find the child.

39:37.697 --> 39:39.966
Oh, here he is.

39:39.968 --> 39:42.938
Right where we
sometimes find him.

39:43.939 --> 39:45.204
Hello.

39:45.206 --> 39:48.576
Yeah, he likes
to be called Bill.

39:50.544 --> 39:52.345
So they take me to school
every morning,

39:52.347 --> 39:54.981
and then they pick me up
every afternoon.

39:54.983 --> 39:57.584
Together? They both go?

39:57.586 --> 40:00.986
It's usually Paul.

40:00.988 --> 40:03.055
No, it's always Paul.

40:03.057 --> 40:05.225
Has anything happened here
at home

40:05.227 --> 40:08.330
that frightened
or disturbed you?

40:09.396 --> 40:11.097
No.

40:11.099 --> 40:13.135
Are you sure?

40:14.401 --> 40:15.867
Like what?

40:15.869 --> 40:19.540
Like any hitting or yelling?

40:20.807 --> 40:23.742
Mm, not really.

40:23.744 --> 40:25.544
Not really?

40:25.546 --> 40:26.611
You're not sure?

40:26.613 --> 40:27.946
I mean no.

40:27.948 --> 40:30.515
Have you seen anything
that confused you?

40:30.517 --> 40:36.287
Certain kinds of touching
that made you uncomfortable?

40:36.289 --> 40:37.323
No.

40:37.325 --> 40:39.158
It seems like
something happened

40:39.160 --> 40:42.495
that you don't want
to talk to me about.

40:42.497 --> 40:44.666
But you can tell me
anything.

40:47.668 --> 40:49.734
Can't I just show you?

40:49.736 --> 40:51.271
Of course.

40:51.273 --> 40:55.374
Those flat shoes.
Flap, flap, flap, flap, flap.

40:55.376 --> 40:58.980
They're so flat,
it actually makes her shorter.

41:00.081 --> 41:04.483
It's not even an inch.
It's completely flat.

41:04.485 --> 41:05.952
Everything all right?

41:05.954 --> 41:09.358
Totally fine.
What a large room.

41:11.892 --> 41:13.526
The hell does that mean?

41:13.528 --> 41:15.530
I hate her.

41:16.664 --> 41:19.164
Excuse me...

41:19.166 --> 41:22.203
Would both of you
come this way, please?

41:24.139 --> 41:27.575
Do you think she heard us
calling her a dumb bitch?

41:31.646 --> 41:34.483
Hope she hasn't found
the porn. Heh.

41:36.617 --> 41:41.187
Yeah, I mean, most of the places
I go are really horrific.

41:41.189 --> 41:44.222
So when I saw this house,
I was like, "Lucky kid."

41:44.224 --> 41:46.158
But you can't give
a kid porno.

41:46.160 --> 41:49.794
Yes, but the thing is,
they are all Paul's.

41:49.796 --> 41:51.564
What? No, they're not.

41:51.566 --> 41:52.999
Some of them.

41:53.001 --> 41:54.499
You know,
we keep this locked up.

41:54.501 --> 41:56.836
The thing about a lock is,
it has no meaning

41:56.838 --> 41:58.204
if there's a key in it.

41:58.206 --> 42:00.740
Is that Confucius? Heh.

42:00.742 --> 42:01.908
No, that's true.

42:01.910 --> 42:03.376
I was just trying to find <i>ET.</i>

42:03.378 --> 42:05.010
- Hey. <i>ET.</i>
- Bill!

42:05.012 --> 42:08.847
- Classic Spielberg. Weaver of dreams.
- Oh.

42:08.849 --> 42:10.716
I love when
his finger lights up.

42:10.718 --> 42:12.151
That's how you can tell
he's an alien.

42:12.153 --> 42:14.289
- And his face.
- And his face.

42:15.322 --> 42:17.491
Bill, would you give us
a moment?

42:22.095 --> 42:24.229
<i>Sex Wars: Phantom Ass.</i>

42:24.231 --> 42:25.664
It's just a phase
he was going through.

42:25.666 --> 42:27.767
Yeah, I'm kind of
a <i>Star Wars</i> guy.

42:30.470 --> 42:31.736
<i>Bareback Mountain?</i>

42:31.738 --> 42:33.571
What they do is take
a recognized title

42:33.573 --> 42:36.341
and just give it a bit
of a cheeky twist.

42:36.343 --> 42:37.642
- I get it.
- It's unusual in that

42:37.644 --> 42:41.650
the source material
is also... gay.

42:44.218 --> 42:46.651
<i>Buttpluggerz.</i>
We're throwing them all out.

42:46.653 --> 42:50.525
There's so much online.
What did I just say?

42:53.427 --> 42:55.961
Is it okay if I come back?

42:55.963 --> 42:57.162
Yes, any time.

42:57.164 --> 43:00.365
Great, good,
because I will be back.

43:00.367 --> 43:02.301
We long for you to return.

43:02.303 --> 43:06.104
Late mornings
generally are best.

43:06.106 --> 43:07.539
One last thing.

43:07.541 --> 43:09.575
It really feels like
you should be cooking

43:09.577 --> 43:12.144
something nutritious
for Bill at home,

43:12.146 --> 43:13.479
not just grabbing fast food,

43:13.481 --> 43:14.979
especially given
your line of work.

43:14.981 --> 43:17.182
- It's not me. It's him.
- That's great advice.

43:17.184 --> 43:20.889
Thank you so much
for that input.

43:22.889 --> 43:25.126
Have a good day.

43:27.327 --> 43:28.760
What a queer fish.

43:28.762 --> 43:30.731
Uh, <i>yeah.</i>

43:32.800 --> 43:36.702
Does he have friends
outside of school?

43:36.704 --> 43:39.405
Uh, two of us.

43:39.407 --> 43:41.807
Household employees.

43:41.809 --> 43:42.941
Staff.

43:42.943 --> 43:44.544
Anyone his age?

43:44.546 --> 43:46.211
Uh, well, there's Tino.

43:46.213 --> 43:49.148
Oh, good, Tino.
How old is Tino?

43:49.150 --> 43:50.349
24.

43:50.351 --> 43:53.287
No, he doesn't really.

43:54.287 --> 43:56.354
I would like to refer you

43:56.356 --> 43:59.858
to a developmental therapist
here in Santa Fe.

43:59.860 --> 44:03.294
- Are you saying he's insane?
- No, no, no, of course not.

44:03.296 --> 44:05.430
But treatment
can benefit someone

44:05.432 --> 44:08.066
who's been living with
an unstable personality.

44:08.068 --> 44:09.734
Maybe I should get
some treatment.

44:09.736 --> 44:11.370
Of course,
if you feel that you...

44:11.372 --> 44:14.307
- He's joking.
- I...

44:14.309 --> 44:16.941
In any event,
I have a very important

44:16.943 --> 44:20.780
harvest-abundance episode of
my television program to record.

44:20.782 --> 44:22.648
So if you've nothing further
to say, I'll take my leave,

44:22.650 --> 44:25.617
and if you could find the time
to teach him how to spell,

44:25.619 --> 44:29.490
add and subtract,
that would suffice.

44:34.262 --> 44:35.961
Un-fucking-believable.

44:35.963 --> 44:37.997
She's just trying
to do her job, Paul.

44:37.999 --> 44:40.966
Not her. You, you dumb dick.

44:40.968 --> 44:43.570
- What?
- He <i>should</i> be making friends.

44:43.572 --> 44:45.070
My God, after
everything he's been...

44:45.072 --> 44:48.106
- What concern is it of yours?
- Excuse me?

44:48.108 --> 44:51.276
You've expressed how little
interest you have in him.

44:51.278 --> 44:52.912
Mm-hmm, and I pick him up
from school every day.

44:52.914 --> 44:55.648
And I appreciate your efforts,
but you made it abundantly clear

44:55.650 --> 44:57.450
you don't want to be saddled
with the responsibility.

44:57.452 --> 44:59.619
Well, I am saddled
with the responsibility.

44:59.621 --> 45:01.519
When he first arrived
I thought, oh, I don't know

45:01.521 --> 45:02.921
- how we're going to handle...
- Paul...

45:02.923 --> 45:04.457
Can you make a mental note
of all this,

45:04.459 --> 45:06.425
and we can sort it out
over a smart cocktail?

45:06.427 --> 45:08.526
I have something
at stake here.

45:08.528 --> 45:10.296
- What?
- When he got here,

45:10.298 --> 45:12.030
I thought, oh, great,
you know what?

45:12.032 --> 45:13.832
I'm going to be stuck
with all the responsibility.

45:13.834 --> 45:16.369
And surprise,
I <i>am</i> stuck with it,

45:16.371 --> 45:19.070
but I will not wake up
early every day,

45:19.072 --> 45:21.807
wake him up, pack his lunch,
help him with his homework...

45:21.809 --> 45:23.575
yeah, by the way,
he has homework...

45:23.577 --> 45:26.144
and have you tell me
it has nothing to do with me.

45:27.615 --> 45:30.850
You know what? I am so sick
of being this furious.

45:30.852 --> 45:34.753
I... I give up.

45:34.755 --> 45:37.256
What am I doing?
You have to tape.

45:37.258 --> 45:39.124
I have to stay here
and pick him up.

45:39.126 --> 45:40.526
No, Tino can pick him up.

45:40.528 --> 45:42.428
- I'll pick him up.
- Don't be a martyr.

45:42.430 --> 45:44.633
Oh, God. This.

45:46.334 --> 45:48.901
This, I never imagined
for myself.

45:48.903 --> 45:50.436
I went to Wesleyan.

45:50.438 --> 45:52.704
My contemporaries
are scions of industry.

45:52.706 --> 45:55.941
I should be living in New York
running the Food Network,

45:55.943 --> 45:58.776
not sitting here
in this dusty pueblo

45:58.778 --> 46:00.780
babysitting the boy
from <i>The Shining.</i>

46:00.782 --> 46:03.249
Yeah, and I went to Oxford
and all my friends...

46:03.251 --> 46:05.818
You went to cooking school
in the town of Oxford.

46:05.820 --> 46:08.019
- What's your point?
- It's a very different thing.

46:08.021 --> 46:09.254
What's your point?

46:09.256 --> 46:12.524
My friends
at <i>The Rachel Ray Show</i>

46:12.526 --> 46:15.626
called me again and told me

46:15.628 --> 46:19.366
there's still a job there
for me if I want it.

46:20.901 --> 46:22.570
Idle threat.

46:24.338 --> 46:25.704
Mm.

46:25.706 --> 46:28.676
Wait up, wait up!

46:30.945 --> 46:33.245
Wait, what do we do best?

46:33.247 --> 46:35.314
Drink and argue.

46:35.316 --> 46:36.682
Throw parties.

46:36.684 --> 46:38.450
We just need to give Bill
a proper birthday.

46:38.452 --> 46:40.352
- It's his birthday?
- Doesn't matter.

46:40.354 --> 46:42.055
But we do need to freshen up
the genre.

46:42.057 --> 46:44.523
We need a theme,
something stunning.

46:44.525 --> 46:47.660
I thought we were
in the middle of a fight.

46:47.662 --> 46:48.797
What?

46:50.932 --> 46:53.032
Forget "Pin the Tail
on the Donkey."

46:53.034 --> 46:55.233
Try "Pinning the Tail
on Ganesh,"

46:55.235 --> 46:59.271
the elephant-headed Hindu deity
at your next children's party.

46:59.273 --> 47:01.573
I'm going to take you on a tour
of the Indian subcontinent,

47:01.575 --> 47:03.642
where we're going
to discover the secrets

47:03.644 --> 47:07.213
of tandoori lobster dogs,
saffron cupcakes,

47:07.215 --> 47:09.517
and tamarind ice cream.

47:11.119 --> 47:13.318
This is your passage to India.

47:13.320 --> 47:18.222
I'm a Erasmus Brumble,
and this is <i>Ideal Home.</i>

47:23.631 --> 47:26.733
One of the staples
of authentic Indian cuisine

47:26.735 --> 47:29.635
is of course naan,
the indigenous flatbread.

47:29.637 --> 47:31.769
But I need someone
to help me roll the dough.

47:31.771 --> 47:33.372
- Heather...
- My name's not Heather.

47:33.374 --> 47:34.939
- It's Whitney.
- That's all right.

47:34.941 --> 47:36.675
Bill, would you like
to help me grind

47:36.677 --> 47:39.311
some tamarind paste
with this pestle and mortar?

47:39.313 --> 47:41.180
No. Let's get Taco Bell.

47:41.182 --> 47:42.715
- Yeah! Taco Bell!
- Cut!

47:42.717 --> 47:47.586
Taco Bell! Taco Bell!
Taco Bell! Taco Bell!

47:53.327 --> 47:55.227
- Hey.
- What?

47:55.229 --> 47:58.296
- Is this your party?
- Yeah.

47:58.298 --> 48:00.435
Do you have two dads?

48:01.401 --> 48:05.336
No. Well, I don't know.

48:05.338 --> 48:06.907
Sort of.

48:08.343 --> 48:10.075
That's littering.

48:10.077 --> 48:11.343
So what?

48:11.345 --> 48:13.111
We don't do that here.

48:27.394 --> 48:28.896
Wow!

48:31.965 --> 48:33.030
Wow!

48:33.032 --> 48:35.733
Oh, my gosh,
this has been so amazing.

48:35.735 --> 48:38.135
Um, Chelsea's got
a birthday next weekend.

48:38.137 --> 48:40.539
- Mmm...
- And we would so love

48:40.541 --> 48:42.709
to have you guys come.

48:43.610 --> 48:45.577
- Well, fantastic.
- Yeah?

48:45.579 --> 48:48.546
Try and keep us away.

48:55.590 --> 48:57.890
See, the Spurs need to stick
to what they do best,

48:57.892 --> 49:00.459
work as a team.
I mean, you got Ginobili,

49:00.461 --> 49:03.028
you got Leonard, small ball.
Thanks, hon.

49:03.030 --> 49:06.298
I don't really know
who those people are.

49:06.300 --> 49:08.901
I don't even know what sport
you're talking about.

49:08.903 --> 49:10.568
I think
it's baseball, is it?

49:10.570 --> 49:12.104
That's the one
with a small ball.

49:12.106 --> 49:13.705
I know that.

49:13.707 --> 49:16.709
- We're not really sporty types.
- No.

49:17.878 --> 49:20.979
Oh... Holy shit! Heh.

49:20.981 --> 49:24.115
I got my first blowie
when this song was playing.

49:24.117 --> 49:25.552
Oh?

49:28.255 --> 49:31.059
Um. She was...

49:32.293 --> 49:34.158
She was...

49:34.160 --> 49:36.164
A girl?

49:37.231 --> 49:38.396
Yeah.

49:38.398 --> 49:40.767
Did she have
big old tits?

49:43.470 --> 49:46.070
We just got the couch.
You can have ice in there.

49:46.072 --> 49:48.474
You can have beer in there.
You can sit back, relax.

49:48.476 --> 49:53.144
Functional, stylish, comfy.
What more could you ask for?

49:54.447 --> 49:56.414
You know, it's not like
on your TV show but...

49:56.416 --> 49:58.582
Oh, no...

49:58.584 --> 50:03.756
- But... I mean...
- Well...

50:03.758 --> 50:05.390
Everyone's different,
aren't they?

50:05.392 --> 50:07.492
The world would be a pretty dull
place if we were all the same.

50:07.494 --> 50:08.926
- Hear, hear.
- Right?

50:09.863 --> 50:10.762
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

50:10.764 --> 50:12.030
Would you...

50:12.032 --> 50:14.134
Would you rather
have white wine?

50:16.938 --> 50:18.303
Uh...

50:18.305 --> 50:19.570
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

50:19.572 --> 50:21.238
Yeah? Okay.
Sorry about that.

50:21.240 --> 50:23.774
You know what,
they seem like a nice family.

50:23.776 --> 50:25.077
They seem happy.

50:25.079 --> 50:28.747
Yeah, well,
I'd rather be all fucked up

50:28.749 --> 50:30.481
and live in a nice house.

50:30.483 --> 50:33.086
Well, then, dreams
really do come true.

50:33.954 --> 50:36.387
And of that song
has invaded my mind.

50:36.389 --> 50:38.224
Oh, that fucking song.

50:43.831 --> 50:45.829
- All right, bye.
- See you tomorrow, Bill.

50:45.831 --> 50:47.865
Bye.

50:47.867 --> 50:52.204
Well, they seem like nice boys.
What are their names?

50:52.206 --> 50:55.274
One is named Lantem...

50:55.276 --> 50:56.675
Lathem... Lathem!

50:56.677 --> 51:00.048
And the other is named...
I don't know.

51:01.247 --> 51:04.015
Okay. Well, I had to park
on the other block.

51:04.017 --> 51:07.186
It was so crowded.

51:07.188 --> 51:10.291
Idiot!

51:11.959 --> 51:14.160
Not... Not you, him.
Are you all right?

51:14.162 --> 51:15.361
Yeah.

51:15.363 --> 51:18.396
Oh! Why don't you hold
my hand for now?

51:18.398 --> 51:19.631
No.

51:19.633 --> 51:21.033
Bill, take my hand.

51:21.035 --> 51:22.901
- I don't want to.
- You were almost killed.

51:22.903 --> 51:24.903
- I don't care!
- I do! I'm the adult!

51:24.905 --> 51:26.604
You're the child!
And you're gonna do as I say!

51:26.606 --> 51:28.041
Fuck you!

51:35.849 --> 51:38.218
What's the matter?

51:40.053 --> 51:42.754
I c-can't... I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

51:44.358 --> 51:45.892
I can't breathe.

51:55.369 --> 51:57.005
I need an ambulance.

52:05.678 --> 52:07.778
- Are you having chest pain now?
- Yeah.

52:07.780 --> 52:10.381
Are you going to be okay?

52:10.383 --> 52:12.885
I don't know.

52:14.521 --> 52:17.455
Your blood pressure
is a little high,

52:17.457 --> 52:20.193
but I don't see anything else.

52:22.128 --> 52:24.398
Have you ever had
a panic attack?

52:26.532 --> 52:27.599
Hmm?

52:27.601 --> 52:28.800
Do you have any history

52:28.802 --> 52:31.672
of anxiety or panic attacks?

52:32.907 --> 52:34.740
I do. I, uh...

52:34.742 --> 52:38.676
I... I think
I'm having a heart attack,

52:38.678 --> 52:40.945
and it, uh...

52:40.947 --> 52:42.914
it turns out to be anxiety.

52:42.916 --> 52:46.453
So you've called
an ambulance before?

52:47.521 --> 52:48.620
Yeah.

52:48.622 --> 52:50.191
How many times?

52:53.994 --> 52:57.229
Nine times maybe?
About nine times.

53:00.568 --> 53:01.800
Yeah.

53:01.802 --> 53:04.570
<i>But you saved his life.</i>

53:04.572 --> 53:07.138
You get a coupon for redemption

53:07.140 --> 53:09.506
when you arrive
at the gates of heaven.

53:09.508 --> 53:11.843
Mmm. It was so disturbing,

53:11.845 --> 53:14.546
watching the kid
almost get killed,

53:14.548 --> 53:19.053
and then the screaming match,
and then I had one of my things.

53:20.220 --> 53:21.653
What things?

53:21.655 --> 53:22.887
My panic things.

53:22.889 --> 53:25.459
You didn't call an ambulance.

53:27.193 --> 53:29.593
Oh, no.

53:29.595 --> 53:31.129
It was humiliating.

53:31.131 --> 53:32.731
We didn't even make it
to the hospital.

53:32.733 --> 53:35.200
The EMT just told me
to take it easy.

53:35.202 --> 53:37.968
And death is cheated once more.

53:37.970 --> 53:40.638
Away, you shadowy specter.

53:40.640 --> 53:42.441
Where are my pills?

53:42.443 --> 53:44.977
Hey, hey, just, you know,
have a tequila

53:44.979 --> 53:47.412
and think pleasant thoughts.

53:47.414 --> 53:48.946
Oh, God, I can't.

53:48.948 --> 53:51.048
Every night my dreams end
in the Apocalypse,

53:51.050 --> 53:53.852
alien invasions,
and mega tsunamis.

53:53.854 --> 53:55.586
Your dreams are
so big-budget.

53:55.588 --> 53:58.524
I just dream I'm naked
and people are laughing at me.

53:58.526 --> 54:00.959
Oh. I dream that, too.

54:00.961 --> 54:04.729
You know,
eventually, you just have to

54:04.731 --> 54:08.401
make a decision to be happy.

54:11.505 --> 54:13.805
Never do that voice again.

54:21.814 --> 54:24.883
Rise and shine.

54:24.885 --> 54:26.651
Come on, kiddo.
Time to get up.

54:28.222 --> 54:31.088
School. Did you finish
your book report?

54:31.090 --> 54:32.959
Yes.

54:54.548 --> 54:56.948
You want to tell me
what my anxiety medication

54:56.950 --> 54:59.153
is doing in your backpack?

55:03.289 --> 55:05.624
Have you taken
any of these?

55:05.626 --> 55:07.459
No.

55:07.461 --> 55:08.926
Well, where are they?

55:08.928 --> 55:10.762
The entire bottle
is missing.

55:10.764 --> 55:12.064
I don't have them.

55:12.066 --> 55:14.334
What have you done with them?

55:16.535 --> 55:19.974
Out with it, young man.
This is serious.

55:23.543 --> 55:27.412
I sold them to this kid
in the middle school.

55:27.414 --> 55:30.448
- Thank God for that.
- Thank God?

55:30.450 --> 55:32.416
Well, at least he hasn't
taken them himself.

55:32.418 --> 55:36.086
Wh-? Where would you get an idea
to do something like that?

55:37.525 --> 55:39.057
What?

55:39.059 --> 55:41.425
His father.
Your father.

55:41.427 --> 55:44.363
Oh, well, yeah.
I mean, that's... Okay.

55:44.365 --> 55:47.635
Why did you feel
the need to do this?

55:49.302 --> 55:52.169
- I needed money.
- For what?

55:52.171 --> 55:56.010
Don't we buy you
everything you could ask for?

55:56.809 --> 55:59.313
I need money in case...

56:00.847 --> 56:03.183
In case what?

56:04.251 --> 56:06.483
In case I'm not here.

56:06.485 --> 56:09.787
In case that Melissa lady
takes me or something.

56:18.599 --> 56:19.865
Listen to me.

56:19.867 --> 56:23.568
You're not going
anywhere, okay?

56:23.570 --> 56:25.137
I won't let it happen.

56:25.139 --> 56:27.039
We won't let it happen.

56:27.041 --> 56:29.207
Look at me.

56:29.209 --> 56:33.247
We promise.
Do you understand?

56:34.981 --> 56:38.184
And if you promise
not to deal drugs...

56:40.086 --> 56:41.787
we'll give you $100
a week.

56:41.789 --> 56:45.691
Wait, no. 50.

56:45.693 --> 56:47.526
Okay.

56:47.528 --> 56:49.597
I'll do it for 100.

56:51.497 --> 56:52.930
- Okay. All right, yeah.
- Oh.

56:52.932 --> 56:55.066
- Okay, Great. Great!
- Yay!

56:55.068 --> 56:58.003
All right!
High fives all around.

56:59.972 --> 57:01.939
- Good job.
- Crisis averted.

57:01.941 --> 57:04.575
Bring it. We did it.

57:04.577 --> 57:07.113
Yay!

57:49.021 --> 57:50.623
Good dinner. Good.

58:28.461 --> 58:31.264
Come on, Bill.

58:32.499 --> 58:35.136
No, you're not gonna
make me do it.

58:46.579 --> 58:50.115
"In conclusion, my parents
have taught me about recycling

58:50.117 --> 58:52.584
"because they love me,
and they love the Earth.

58:52.586 --> 58:54.019
The end."

58:54.021 --> 58:56.122
All right.

58:57.490 --> 59:02.496
Thank you, Symphony.
And next is Bill.

59:09.470 --> 59:11.836
"I live with Paul and Erasmus."

59:11.838 --> 59:14.738
Bill, remember, look
your audience in the eye.

59:14.740 --> 59:18.111
Okay? And let's try it
a little louder.

59:20.914 --> 59:24.215
"I live with Paul and
Erasmus. They are not my dads.

59:24.217 --> 59:26.720
"But they do
all the stuff dads do.

59:28.088 --> 59:29.454
"They are gay.

59:29.456 --> 59:31.590
"In the olden days,
it was illegal to be gay.

59:31.592 --> 59:33.591
"There are some words
you should never use

59:33.593 --> 59:37.164
"when you are talking
to someone who is gay.

59:38.164 --> 59:40.231
"Never say 'faggot.'

59:42.269 --> 59:45.537
- "Never say 'cocksucker.'
- Bill!

59:46.939 --> 59:49.372
"And never, ever, ever say..."

59:49.374 --> 59:51.142
Bill, please stop! No!

59:51.144 --> 59:53.010
"Buttfucking."

59:57.916 --> 01:00:00.419
"In the olden days,
it was illegal to be gay."

01:00:00.421 --> 01:00:01.686
Indeed it was.

01:00:01.688 --> 01:00:03.354
"Some words you should
never say

01:00:03.356 --> 01:00:04.856
"when you are talking
to someone who is gay.

01:00:04.858 --> 01:00:07.591
"Never say 'faggot.'
Never say 'cocksucker.'"

01:00:09.296 --> 01:00:11.229
Unfortunately,
the school district

01:00:11.231 --> 01:00:13.698
doesn't find quite
the same sense of humor

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.300
in this situation.

01:00:15.302 --> 01:00:18.570
He... He said this aloud
in, in class?

01:00:18.572 --> 01:00:23.073
Up to and including that word.

01:00:25.744 --> 01:00:28.879
Did he say "buttfucking"?
Did he say "buttfucking"?

01:00:30.918 --> 01:00:34.220
- Never, ever say "buttfucking."
- Gentlemen!

01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:40.258
Where do you think
he's learning these terms?

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:44.229
Um... It's... it's...
We don't make a habit

01:00:44.231 --> 01:00:46.798
of using words like that,
I have to say.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.535
Um, unless it...
unless it's in context.

01:00:51.537 --> 01:00:53.204
I see where he gets it.

01:00:53.206 --> 01:00:54.606
I hate to say this,
but I do think it's a case

01:00:54.608 --> 01:00:56.108
of pot calling the kettle black?

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:58.209
I did notice the word "felching"

01:00:58.211 --> 01:00:59.943
on your classroom wall,

01:00:59.945 --> 01:01:03.316
which I thought was highly
inappropriate in a classroom.

01:01:04.084 --> 01:01:05.550
That is "felting."

01:01:05.552 --> 01:01:08.720
Oh, yeah,
that makes more sense.

01:01:08.722 --> 01:01:10.888
Felching isn't
until middle school.

01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:14.559
I am so not into that.
Can't speak for him.

01:01:14.561 --> 01:01:16.762
Guilty as charged.

01:01:16.764 --> 01:01:21.932
- This is serious.
- Hello? Oh, yes.

01:01:21.934 --> 01:01:24.604
We were wondering when we were
going to hear from you.

01:01:25.604 --> 01:01:27.939
How's it going, Angel?
How you doing?

01:01:27.941 --> 01:01:29.541
Tell them how
you're doing, Bill.

01:01:29.543 --> 01:01:33.044
- Good.
- He likes to be called Bill.

01:01:33.046 --> 01:01:36.615
Bill? Is that right?

01:01:36.617 --> 01:01:39.283
Well, you know, angels were one
of your mom's favorite things.

01:01:39.285 --> 01:01:41.352
So that's why
we named you Angel.

01:01:41.354 --> 01:01:44.254
That's still his name legally,
of course.

01:01:44.256 --> 01:01:46.624
But he's been doing great
at school.

01:01:46.626 --> 01:01:50.294
Uh, a whole spate of friends,
and...

01:01:50.296 --> 01:01:51.896
Would you like
to tell your father

01:01:51.898 --> 01:01:53.865
about your new friends,
young man?

01:01:53.867 --> 01:01:55.903
No.

01:01:57.503 --> 01:02:00.104
Well, it sounds like
you're doing really good.

01:02:00.106 --> 01:02:02.374
And, you know, I've been
doing really good in here.

01:02:02.376 --> 01:02:05.542
I've been going to church.
I feel a lot better now.

01:02:05.544 --> 01:02:07.111
I'm so clearheaded.

01:02:07.113 --> 01:02:10.215
The big news is the minister's
really gone all out

01:02:10.217 --> 01:02:11.682
for me to get an early release.

01:02:11.684 --> 01:02:14.051
So I'm gonna be out of here
before New Year's.

01:02:14.053 --> 01:02:15.787
- Bravo.
- And the church has also

01:02:15.789 --> 01:02:18.088
set me up with
a sponsor in Arizona.

01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:19.390
So when I do get out of here,

01:02:19.392 --> 01:02:20.892
me and Angel
are gonna go to Arizona,

01:02:20.894 --> 01:02:23.397
and we're gonna start working
for a minister there.

01:02:24.631 --> 01:02:27.731
- Arizona?
- Yeah, that's right.

01:02:27.733 --> 01:02:30.468
I think we need consider
how the boy

01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:33.171
has settled in
at school here in Santa Fe.

01:02:33.173 --> 01:02:34.805
He has a lot of friends.

01:02:34.807 --> 01:02:36.774
There's a school at the church.
He'll make new friends.

01:02:36.776 --> 01:02:38.343
Well, I think, I think
we need to consider

01:02:38.345 --> 01:02:41.345
- all this very carefully.
- He's my boy.

01:02:41.347 --> 01:02:44.015
I thank you both
for taking care of him.

01:02:44.017 --> 01:02:50.323
But there is a plan in place.
And it's a good plan.

01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:53.191
What if I want to stay?

01:02:53.193 --> 01:02:55.593
All is well,
and all will be well.

01:02:55.595 --> 01:02:58.829
- But do I have to go?
- Okay, look.

01:02:58.831 --> 01:03:00.530
If I tell you something,
will you promise

01:03:00.532 --> 01:03:02.934
to remember it
for as long as you can?

01:03:02.936 --> 01:03:04.838
Yeah.

01:03:06.106 --> 01:03:09.543
Everything is temporary.

01:03:18.084 --> 01:03:19.783
Except herpes.

01:03:19.785 --> 01:03:22.555
- What's herpes?
- Paul...

01:03:26.026 --> 01:03:27.825
I'm not trying
to arrange permanent custody.

01:03:27.827 --> 01:03:30.028
I'm just trying to see
if I can somehow delay

01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:31.829
the child going to him.

01:03:31.831 --> 01:03:34.432
He finally has some stability.
It must count for something.

01:03:34.434 --> 01:03:36.600
<i>Well, there just
isn't a court in the country</i>

01:03:36.602 --> 01:03:38.836
<i>that is gonna separate
a child from his parent.</i>

01:03:38.838 --> 01:03:40.604
<i>There just isn't,
unless the child</i>

01:03:40.606 --> 01:03:43.006
<i>is in some kind of
quantifiable danger.</i>

01:03:43.008 --> 01:03:45.709
<i>I'm sorry, Erasmus, you really
don't have any leverage.</i>

01:03:45.711 --> 01:03:47.912
Well, thank you
for what has effectively been

01:03:47.914 --> 01:03:50.182
a $400 phone call
for you to say no.

01:03:50.184 --> 01:03:51.950
- Piss off.
- <i>Era...</i>

01:03:51.952 --> 01:03:53.718
Assholes,
the lot of them!

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.519
We should probably
watch our language here.

01:03:56.521 --> 01:03:58.523
- Why?
- Because it's a fucking church.

01:03:58.525 --> 01:04:01.358
I'm just trying to get the boy
away from his idiotic father.

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.095
Well, you might not get that.
You might not get what you want.

01:04:05.097 --> 01:04:06.900
Well, why not, Paul?

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:09.334
Because God hates you.

01:04:11.171 --> 01:04:14.472
Look, we have him
through the holidays.

01:04:14.474 --> 01:04:16.410
All right?

01:04:17.878 --> 01:04:20.611
Come on.
Let's put on a show.

01:04:20.613 --> 01:04:23.082
- I was going to say that.
- I know.

01:04:29.088 --> 01:04:32.222
<i>In Mexico and
many Latin American countries,</i>

01:04:32.224 --> 01:04:36.093
<i>Christmas Eve is celebrated
even more than the day itself.</i>

01:04:36.095 --> 01:04:40.164
<i>In my home, I like to prepare
a flavorful Mexican supper</i>

01:04:40.166 --> 01:04:43.233
<i>of fresh-made
green-corn tamales,</i>

01:04:43.235 --> 01:04:44.635
<i>whole roast pig</i>

01:04:44.637 --> 01:04:47.771
<i>and
for dessert.</i>

01:04:47.773 --> 01:04:50.675
<i>Afterwards, we'll attend
a traditional pageant</i>

01:04:50.677 --> 01:04:52.244
<i>known as La Posadas,</i>

01:04:52.246 --> 01:04:54.111
<i>which retells the story
of Mary and Joseph</i>

01:04:54.113 --> 01:04:56.613
<i>looking for shelter
in Bethlehem.</i>

01:04:56.615 --> 01:05:02.422
<i>Then we cross the Atlantic
for a proper English dinner.</i>

01:05:03.657 --> 01:05:05.856
No, further out.
Further out.

01:05:09.095 --> 01:05:11.629
I'll say,
you look handsome.

01:05:13.999 --> 01:05:16.367
You're allowed
to take one present.

01:05:16.369 --> 01:05:18.102
Well, how about three?

01:05:18.104 --> 01:05:21.108
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.628
- Yeah?
- O.M.G.

01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:46.129
Do we have more?

01:05:46.131 --> 01:05:47.465
Wow.

01:06:06.887 --> 01:06:09.823
Okay, and cue the harem.

01:06:12.592 --> 01:06:15.496
And heavenly glow.

01:06:53.099 --> 01:06:57.300
This really is
the land of enchantment.

01:06:57.302 --> 01:06:59.238
Oh, so nice.

01:07:04.577 --> 01:07:05.843
They let you out.

01:07:05.845 --> 01:07:08.445
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

01:07:08.447 --> 01:07:11.317
- Merry Christmas.
- Hey, bud.

01:07:12.485 --> 01:07:15.756
Come on, you want to come
over here and give me a hug?

01:07:17.222 --> 01:07:19.793
Attaboy.

01:07:20.727 --> 01:07:24.762
How you doing?
You okay? Oh, God.

01:07:24.764 --> 01:07:26.798
- This is absurd!
- It's just the way it is!

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.399
This was never supposed
to be permanent.

01:07:28.401 --> 01:07:30.401
Why are you doing this?!
You trying to infuriate me?!

01:07:30.403 --> 01:07:33.004
You trying to cause as much
anguish as you possibly can?

01:07:33.006 --> 01:07:35.872
Oh, stop it, the world
doesn't spin around you.

01:07:35.874 --> 01:07:37.675
No, it spins around the boy,
and you're trying

01:07:37.677 --> 01:07:40.611
to yank him away from the one
decent Christmas he's ever had

01:07:40.613 --> 01:07:42.445
in the middle
of the fucking night!

01:07:42.447 --> 01:07:44.948
That's what this is all about
isn't it, some big spectacle!

01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:47.218
Do you know that presents
and all the decorations

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:48.919
in the world,
that doesn't make Christmas.

01:07:48.921 --> 01:07:50.421
For a little boy, it does.

01:07:50.423 --> 01:07:53.457
No, family makes Christmas.
And I'm his father.

01:07:53.459 --> 01:07:56.626
You seem to have forgotten
that I'm <i>your</i> father.

01:07:56.628 --> 01:07:59.530
Oh.

01:07:59.532 --> 01:08:01.265
Do you want to go there?

01:08:01.267 --> 01:08:03.667
No.

01:08:03.669 --> 01:08:08.675
Please, at least
stay the night.

01:08:14.247 --> 01:08:16.481
Why is the music so loud?!

01:08:17.683 --> 01:08:19.216
What?!

01:08:19.219 --> 01:08:21.084
You were shouting.

01:08:21.086 --> 01:08:22.419
Oh, yes.

01:08:22.421 --> 01:08:25.287
Yes! Yes!

01:08:25.290 --> 01:08:30.227
Well, this Christmas looks epic.
Santa has come early.

01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:32.828
I'll believe in Santa
if this is what it gets me.

01:08:32.831 --> 01:08:34.330
Smokin' board.

01:08:34.332 --> 01:08:36.700
Why don't we have
a proper breakfast tomorrow?

01:08:36.702 --> 01:08:40.104
Um, we should start a brioche.

01:08:40.106 --> 01:08:41.805
And then perhaps
something sweet,

01:08:41.808 --> 01:08:43.140
a nutty sticky bun.

01:08:43.142 --> 01:08:45.075
That means,
"Paul, go make brioche

01:08:45.077 --> 01:08:47.013
and a sticky, nutty bun."

01:08:47.813 --> 01:08:49.247
Don't I know it?

01:08:49.249 --> 01:08:51.215
Who would like a drink?

01:08:51.216 --> 01:08:53.184
Bo?

01:08:53.185 --> 01:08:54.917
I'm sober.

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:57.386
Ah, yes. So am I.

01:08:57.389 --> 01:09:01.093
Unlike you, however, I'm going
to do something about it.

01:09:02.127 --> 01:09:04.798
- I'll have a...
- I know.

01:09:16.442 --> 01:09:19.779
What? What? What is it?

01:09:23.316 --> 01:09:25.152
They're gone.

01:09:26.818 --> 01:09:28.754
They're gone.

01:09:35.761 --> 01:09:38.995
I didn't even get
to say goodbye.

01:09:38.997 --> 01:09:42.301
I know.
Me either.

01:09:59.719 --> 01:10:01.718
We drove 200 miles
to get here.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.354
You said you would meet us.

01:10:03.356 --> 01:10:04.989
All right,
we've been here for hours.

01:10:04.991 --> 01:10:07.257
We look like a couple
of child predators.

01:10:07.259 --> 01:10:10.627
The only thing we're missing
is a white van.

01:10:10.629 --> 01:10:14.765
I apologize for my friend.

01:10:14.767 --> 01:10:17.501
We're quite normal.

01:10:17.503 --> 01:10:19.872
Do you want some candy?

01:10:24.076 --> 01:10:25.577
<i>Are you all right?</i>

01:10:25.579 --> 01:10:29.814
Well, you sound like
you may have relapsed.

01:10:31.416 --> 01:10:34.952
Don't get me wrong.
I used to <i>love</i> cocaine.

01:10:34.954 --> 01:10:37.424
Let's talk about
what we have in common. Heh.

01:10:39.858 --> 01:10:41.225
All right, let's not.

01:10:41.227 --> 01:10:43.694
I'm just saying
that if you need help,

01:10:43.696 --> 01:10:45.395
I know a very good
rehab facility

01:10:45.397 --> 01:10:47.030
in Tucson, Arizona.

01:10:47.032 --> 01:10:49.801
Um, it has a high failure rate,
but the food's terrific,

01:10:49.803 --> 01:10:52.604
and the group sessions
are hilarious.

01:10:52.606 --> 01:10:53.939
Hello?

01:10:56.308 --> 01:10:58.244
Hello...

01:11:17.929 --> 01:11:20.099
Shall I move the orchid?

01:11:20.967 --> 01:11:22.469
It's fine.

01:11:34.947 --> 01:11:37.448
Wherever we go,
it's so depressing.

01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:40.083
He feels like he has
to pass it on to other people.

01:11:40.085 --> 01:11:41.718
It's like having a broom
up his ass.

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:45.556
What's going on...?

01:11:45.558 --> 01:11:47.394
Hello.

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.493
What's going on in here?

01:11:50.495 --> 01:11:53.663
I was in the kitchen,
and I suddenly got very upset.

01:11:53.665 --> 01:11:54.931
- Didn't I?
- Yeah.

01:11:54.933 --> 01:11:57.603
And Tino was comforting me.

01:11:59.571 --> 01:12:01.171
Why is the door closed?

01:12:01.173 --> 01:12:04.577
It's not like that, Paul.

01:12:06.713 --> 01:12:07.944
Why is the door closed?

01:12:07.946 --> 01:12:10.516
Nothing happened, Paul.

01:12:29.934 --> 01:12:32.872
I'm bereft about
the child being gone.

01:12:33.939 --> 01:12:35.575
So am I.

01:12:36.776 --> 01:12:40.077
You didn't even
want him here.

01:12:40.079 --> 01:12:42.249
How can you say that?

01:12:43.448 --> 01:12:45.182
Shame on you.

01:12:45.184 --> 01:12:47.851
You know, you dismiss me
left and right.

01:12:47.853 --> 01:12:50.520
But I did all the work.
I was the parent.

01:12:50.522 --> 01:12:52.222
You clowned around.

01:12:52.224 --> 01:12:53.524
Well, all right then.

01:12:53.526 --> 01:12:54.992
You know what,
it doesn't matter.

01:12:54.994 --> 01:12:56.025
We're not talking
about the kid.

01:12:56.027 --> 01:12:57.727
This is about that.

01:12:57.729 --> 01:13:00.029
Has it been going on
since you hired him?

01:13:00.031 --> 01:13:01.998
I didn't touch Tino.
Nothing happened.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.234
He was just a shoulder
to cry on.

01:13:03.236 --> 01:13:05.438
I'm your shoulder
to cry on.

01:13:07.673 --> 01:13:09.073
Anyway, you know what?
It doesn't matter

01:13:09.075 --> 01:13:10.440
what happened in there.

01:13:10.442 --> 01:13:11.874
It happened before.
Which you admit.

01:13:11.876 --> 01:13:13.543
With that gardener.
You admit.

01:13:13.545 --> 01:13:15.078
Yes, I admit.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.047
Well, it's going
to happen again.

01:13:17.049 --> 01:13:20.184
It won't happen again.

01:13:20.186 --> 01:13:23.553
Look, I think
you and I both know

01:13:23.555 --> 01:13:25.655
things have been pretty
fucked up between us

01:13:25.657 --> 01:13:27.190
for a long time.

01:13:27.192 --> 01:13:30.060
When the kid showed up,
I pretended everything was...

01:13:30.062 --> 01:13:31.928
fine.

01:13:31.930 --> 01:13:35.166
But I can't pretend anymore.
I can't.

01:13:35.168 --> 01:13:37.400
- Paul...
- Listen to me.

01:13:37.402 --> 01:13:40.236
You know
that if you were dying,

01:13:40.238 --> 01:13:44.609
I would cut the heart
out of my chest for you.

01:13:44.611 --> 01:13:47.412
I would die
so that you would live.

01:13:47.414 --> 01:13:51.981
That's how much I love you.
That's how much I worship you.

01:13:51.983 --> 01:13:55.118
And I think that you
actually know.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.289
You know that.

01:13:58.624 --> 01:14:01.225
- And it doesn't matter to you.
- It does matter to me.

01:14:01.227 --> 01:14:05.598
It doesn't matter.
And I can't stand it anymore.

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.754
You know, I, uh...
I didn't tell you,

01:14:30.756 --> 01:14:34.460
but I got a call
the other day from Rachel Ray.

01:14:36.461 --> 01:14:38.762
Oh.

01:14:38.764 --> 01:14:42.733
What's she like?
I hear she's really nice.

01:14:42.735 --> 01:14:44.200
No, not from her.

01:14:44.202 --> 01:14:47.337
From my friends
who produce her show.

01:14:47.339 --> 01:14:52.411
They, uh... They offered me
a job in New York.

01:14:56.749 --> 01:14:58.082
I'm going to take it.

01:15:13.465 --> 01:15:16.066
Well, I'm almost done
up here.

01:15:16.068 --> 01:15:18.401
I just need to get my books
from your office.

01:15:18.403 --> 01:15:21.340
Yeah, I boxed them all up
last night.

01:15:22.307 --> 01:15:24.044
Thanks for your help.

01:15:26.912 --> 01:15:29.182
Did you get a spray tan?

01:15:30.081 --> 01:15:31.683
No.

01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:37.253
Jemima, had me at
"ski in, ski out."

01:15:37.255 --> 01:15:40.923
I'll be there Friday.
No, I can't come Thursday.

01:15:40.925 --> 01:15:42.993
I've got to see my lawyer.

01:15:42.995 --> 01:15:46.163
Oh, just stupid stuff.

01:15:46.165 --> 01:15:49.266
Yeah. You can have
all these bags.

01:15:49.268 --> 01:15:51.068
I don't really need them.

01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:54.937
Good.
Because they're mine.

01:15:54.939 --> 01:15:56.543
Oh.

01:16:03.982 --> 01:16:08.385
I... I think this might be
the best thing for both of us.

01:16:08.387 --> 01:16:11.321
Well, we had a good run.

01:16:11.323 --> 01:16:14.391
Oh, and remember to keep an eye
on the tile guy tomorrow.

01:16:14.393 --> 01:16:16.493
I think
he's overbilling us.

01:16:17.496 --> 01:16:19.029
I don't give a fuck
what you think

01:16:19.031 --> 01:16:21.234
about the fucking tile guy,
you fucking cunt!

01:16:22.401 --> 01:16:27.340
Oh. And you were
doing so well.

01:17:04.242 --> 01:17:07.979
Please don't leave me.
I can't live without you.

01:17:07.981 --> 01:17:09.646
Don't go.

01:17:09.648 --> 01:17:12.984
Don't go, please,
please, please, please.

01:17:12.986 --> 01:17:15.421
I love you.

01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:21.361
I sure hope
he's not talking to me.

01:17:34.439 --> 01:17:36.038
Keep driving.

01:18:40.607 --> 01:18:42.575
Fuck!

01:21:36.814 --> 01:21:41.086
And this motion will be accepted
by the court at this time.

01:21:50.963 --> 01:21:53.096
The child shall remain
in the custody

01:21:53.098 --> 01:21:57.702
of Erasmus Brumble
and Paul Morgan.

01:21:59.504 --> 01:22:03.239
Oh, well, I must say,

01:22:03.241 --> 01:22:08.444
all that courtroom melodrama
makes a man very hungry.

01:22:08.446 --> 01:22:12.181
- How are you doing?
- I'm hungry, too.

01:22:12.183 --> 01:22:14.454
So what shall we eat?

01:22:23.062 --> 01:22:25.595
Let's not do a whole
thing tonight. I'm exhausted.

01:22:25.597 --> 01:22:27.364
Why don't we just pick up
some sushi?

01:22:27.366 --> 01:22:28.898
You know, supermarket sushi

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:31.168
is like God shitting
on mankind.

01:22:31.170 --> 01:22:32.635
It is everything that
is wrong with this country.

01:22:32.637 --> 01:22:34.136
I didn't say
supermarket sushi.

01:22:34.138 --> 01:22:36.004
I've never had
supermarket sushi in my life.

01:22:36.006 --> 01:22:38.240
Unless it was late at night
and I was blackout drunk

01:22:38.242 --> 01:22:40.510
and I don't remember,
and that probably happened.

01:22:40.512 --> 01:22:42.579
I could make some sushi.
I did train

01:22:42.581 --> 01:22:45.716
with one of the world's
leading sushi chefs.

01:22:45.718 --> 01:22:47.551
That was at a demo
at Williams-Sonoma

01:22:47.553 --> 01:22:49.352
in Albuquerque.
I was with you.

01:22:49.354 --> 01:22:54.490
You know, your version
of events is so pedestrian.

01:22:54.492 --> 01:22:56.193
Also known as reality.

01:22:56.195 --> 01:22:58.061
Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

01:22:58.063 --> 01:23:00.663
Well, why don't we just do
a pasta at home?

01:23:00.665 --> 01:23:02.132
I'm trying to avoid wheat
and dairy, Paul.

01:23:02.134 --> 01:23:03.699
Oh, really,
is that since you had

01:23:03.701 --> 01:23:06.168
the grilled cheese sandwich
for lunch?

01:23:06.170 --> 01:23:07.937
It's a constant struggle.

01:23:07.939 --> 01:23:11.673
Yes, it most
certainly is.

01:23:11.675 --> 01:23:13.511
Guys.

01:23:13.513 --> 01:23:15.278
Why don't you ask me
what I want for dinner?

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:17.413
Well, we just assumed
it was Taco Bell.

01:23:17.415 --> 01:23:19.682
No, I still love it,

01:23:19.684 --> 01:23:22.785
but I'd like
something else tonight.

01:23:22.787 --> 01:23:25.154
- Really?
- What would you like?

01:23:25.156 --> 01:23:27.824
I'd like to have
pork tenderloin

01:23:27.826 --> 01:23:32.095
with caramelized apples
and ginger.

01:23:32.097 --> 01:23:33.062
What the hell?

01:23:33.064 --> 01:23:35.535
What the fuck?

01:23:36.469 --> 01:23:37.801
All right.

01:23:37.803 --> 01:23:39.735
Let's get this kid
a pork tenderloin.

01:23:39.737 --> 01:23:44.641
Maybe some polenta.
With goat cheese.

01:23:44.643 --> 01:23:48.912
Oh, my God.
We've created a monster.

01:23:48.914 --> 01:23:50.913
<i>I</i> created a monster.

01:23:50.915 --> 01:23:53.449
No, you <i>are</i> a monster.

01:23:53.451 --> 01:23:56.886
And now I have to contend
with two of you. Good God.

01:23:58.924 --> 01:24:01.490
Oh, Jesus.

01:24:01.492 --> 01:24:05.261
There's a fucking rainbow.
