00:22.958 --> 00:24.041
<i>Ke-le, my baby.</i>

00:24.125 --> 00:25.750
<i>Do you know what this is?</i>

00:26.375 --> 00:28.000
A heart?

00:28.083 --> 00:30.333
Yes, this is a heart.

00:30.416 --> 00:31.625
Look.

00:31.708 --> 00:32.958
Open it.

00:33.041 --> 00:35.833
You have a hole here,
that's why you must go to a doctor.

00:36.333 --> 00:40.250
Then if I drink milk,
will the milk come out of this hole?

00:40.333 --> 00:43.041
Of course not.
Where do you drink your milk?

00:43.125 --> 00:44.125
My mouth.

00:44.208 --> 00:46.875
If you drink milk from your mouth,
where will it go?

00:46.958 --> 00:49.958
From your throat to your stomach.

00:50.041 --> 00:52.750
Right? It will go to your stomach.

01:05.083 --> 01:06.625
You have goosebumps. Is it ticklish?

01:06.708 --> 01:07.625
No.

01:08.125 --> 01:11.041
Hey, you applied the gel on me.
It's sticky!

01:11.125 --> 01:13.500
<i>This will be my fifth surgery.</i>

01:14.166 --> 01:16.333
An Yi-chi,
will my illness really get better?

01:16.416 --> 01:17.583
Of course.

01:17.666 --> 01:20.208
Besides, you don't have
to be afraid of the surgery.

01:20.291 --> 01:22.500
I'll be here with you.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.875
Who says I'm scared?

01:23.958 --> 01:26.000
You're the coward.
I'm the one keeping you company.

01:26.083 --> 01:30.000
-Okay, I'm the most cowardly one. Okay.
<i>-I used to be unable to say "forever."</i>

01:30.916 --> 01:33.291
<i>I felt that this word</i>

01:33.375 --> 01:36.583
<i>has too many variables and unreality.</i>

01:38.000 --> 01:39.625
<i>But now,</i>

01:39.708 --> 01:42.708
<i>I'm starting to look forward
to forever humbly.</i>

01:44.208 --> 01:45.458
<i>I'm begging God.</i>

01:46.458 --> 01:47.875
<i>If it's possible,</i>

01:47.958 --> 01:48.875
FIVE YEARS OLD!

01:48.958 --> 01:50.916
<i>please let me take care of Ke-le</i>

01:51.833 --> 01:54.833
<i>and be with him forever.</i>

01:54.916 --> 02:00.791
FOREVER

02:00.875 --> 02:03.458
FOREVER

02:08.083 --> 02:09.666
PATIENT RECORD: CHANG CHE-KAI

02:25.333 --> 02:26.708
You're finally home.

02:26.791 --> 02:29.166
I called you several times,
but you wouldn't pick up.

02:29.916 --> 02:31.083
I was riding my motorcycle.

02:31.958 --> 02:33.875
What did the report say?

02:33.958 --> 02:36.458
No, because I've been staying up
late at night too often,

02:36.541 --> 02:37.375
I'm a bit anemic.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.791
I just need to go to bed early.

02:38.875 --> 02:40.708
The doctor told me
to take plenty of vitamin D

02:40.791 --> 02:42.000
and vitamin B complex.

02:42.541 --> 02:43.833
I'm fine.

02:43.916 --> 02:45.625
I told you not to stay up late at night.

02:45.708 --> 02:47.291
You'll listen to the doctor, right?

02:48.666 --> 02:49.666
Hey.

02:51.458 --> 02:53.208
In the end, we didn't get to see

02:53.291 --> 02:55.125
that beach you said was beautiful.

02:56.166 --> 02:58.166
Let's go again this weekend, okay?

02:59.916 --> 03:00.916
There's no need.

03:01.416 --> 03:02.750
Let's not spend time on that.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.958
Dr. Chen, how is the test result?

03:19.041 --> 03:20.208
PATIENT RECORD: CHANG CHE-KAI

03:20.291 --> 03:22.208
Based on your previous examination,

03:22.291 --> 03:24.166
your white blood cell count

03:24.250 --> 03:25.500
was around 20,000.

03:26.333 --> 03:29.750
But right now, your white blood
cell count is a lot higher.

03:29.833 --> 03:31.000
It's over 50,000.

03:33.750 --> 03:35.083
<i>Your leukemia</i>

03:35.583 --> 03:37.541
<i>is showing signs of worsening.</i>

03:41.375 --> 03:42.708
<i>But don't worry.</i>

03:43.208 --> 03:45.666
<i>It's manageable now with medication.</i>

03:48.000 --> 03:49.125
<i>Yes.</i>

03:49.833 --> 03:51.458
I've seen my dad taking those.

04:24.333 --> 04:28.250
VITAMIN C+B

04:48.500 --> 04:49.541
<i>That day,</i>

04:49.625 --> 04:51.833
<i>when Cream cried so sadly at the hospital,</i>

04:54.250 --> 04:56.875
<i>I felt like I've been given
a death sentence.</i>

04:59.458 --> 05:00.625
<i>I was sentenced</i>

05:02.041 --> 05:03.541
<i>to be unqualified to love her.</i>

05:06.583 --> 05:08.791
<i>If I'm really unqualified to love Cream,</i>

05:09.833 --> 05:12.750
<i>I can only ask God for more time</i>

05:16.500 --> 05:19.041
<i>until that person
who can take care of her shows up.</i>

05:21.666 --> 05:24.125
<i>Please let me live a little longer.</i>

05:45.458 --> 05:46.375
Ma'am.

05:55.375 --> 05:56.416
Dr. Yang.

06:03.083 --> 06:04.083
Why are you here?

06:06.291 --> 06:07.416
A patient stood me up.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.125
I thought I should come out for some air
since the weather is nice.

06:12.416 --> 06:13.416
What about you?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.416
Photography must be very expensive.

06:18.375 --> 06:20.250
The cooler a dream seems,

06:20.333 --> 06:21.666
the more expensive it is.

06:27.458 --> 06:28.625
Hold on.

06:33.541 --> 06:34.750
Mr. Li.

06:35.416 --> 06:37.000
Dr. Yang.

06:37.083 --> 06:39.625
You stood me up to eat ice cream here?

06:39.708 --> 06:41.000
Didn't you tell me

06:41.083 --> 06:42.541
that dentures are very expensive?

06:42.625 --> 06:44.333
Aren't you afraid
that all your teeth will rot?

06:46.833 --> 06:48.291
-I'm sorry.
-Mr. Li!

06:56.083 --> 06:57.625
Well, my…

06:57.708 --> 06:59.208
My place is nearby.

06:59.291 --> 07:00.666
If you're not in a hurry,

07:00.750 --> 07:03.083
you can get changed and freshen up there.

07:28.666 --> 07:34.875
JEN KUANG: GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.

07:37.083 --> 07:38.625
I just want to tell you

07:38.708 --> 07:40.750
that there's a fresh towel under the sink.

07:40.833 --> 07:41.791
You can use it.

07:45.916 --> 07:46.875
Thank you.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.291
I'm sorry. My house is a bit messy.

08:06.791 --> 08:08.416
Do you have a bag for clothes?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.375
A bag for clothes? Okay.

08:23.375 --> 08:25.250
This is fine. Thank you.

08:26.291 --> 08:28.666
I'll return the clothes to you
after washing them.

08:28.750 --> 08:29.583
Okay.

08:31.458 --> 08:32.458
Well…

08:32.958 --> 08:35.125
Are you busy later?

08:37.708 --> 08:38.958
What's the matter?

08:40.583 --> 08:41.791
Actually,

08:43.750 --> 08:44.833
I have a washing machine.

08:48.333 --> 08:49.583
It has a dryer function.

08:50.166 --> 08:51.041
I see.

08:53.250 --> 08:54.750
I mean

08:55.250 --> 08:56.291
if you're not in a hurry,

08:56.375 --> 08:58.583
maybe you can leave
after your clothes are dry.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.625
If you have the time.

09:04.708 --> 09:06.708
If I wear your clothes home,

09:07.208 --> 09:08.833
I'll bring them back to you,

09:08.916 --> 09:10.250
isn't that another chance to see me?

09:11.750 --> 09:14.166
But returning the clothes
will last for at most five minutes.

09:14.666 --> 09:17.000
It'll take at least 30 minutes
for the clothes to dry.

09:18.875 --> 09:20.125
I have to go.

09:25.041 --> 09:26.125
However,

09:27.500 --> 09:29.333
you can decide

09:29.833 --> 09:31.208
what to eat for dinner.

09:36.416 --> 09:37.541
Okay.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.000
Dinner was fine, right?

09:59.083 --> 10:01.000
Not bad.
They were all top-grade ingredients.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.875
But very few would fill up on hotpot
on their first date.

10:03.958 --> 10:05.916
You don't go on dates often, right?

10:09.208 --> 10:10.750
Which one do you like better?

10:23.250 --> 10:24.916
These lenses are so nice,

10:25.000 --> 10:26.458
but they're so expensive.

10:28.416 --> 10:29.500
Well…

10:35.375 --> 10:36.916
Hold on. There's a bit more.

10:42.958 --> 10:44.791
The first floor will be my office.

10:45.375 --> 10:46.500
It suits me!

11:26.916 --> 11:29.166
<i>Did the arrangement
of "Wandering in the Border" arrive?</i>

11:30.125 --> 11:31.625
Mr. Teng said he'll submit it on Friday.

11:31.708 --> 11:34.583
It should be in time for A-Lin's recording
of the other two songs next week.

11:34.666 --> 11:37.500
But the copyright to "The Saddest Thing"
still can't be found.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.250
Are we really going to schedule it
for recording?

11:39.958 --> 11:41.083
Schedule it first.

11:41.166 --> 11:42.375
I'll figure something out.

11:43.041 --> 11:44.500
Did you book the recording studio?

11:48.125 --> 11:49.250
An Yi-chi.

11:50.458 --> 11:51.708
An Yi-chi.

11:52.916 --> 11:54.625
Mr. Wang is asking you
about the recording studio.

11:55.958 --> 11:57.458
The recording studio?

11:59.791 --> 12:00.708
The recording studio!

12:01.958 --> 12:03.750
I'm sorry. I'll reserve it now.

12:03.833 --> 12:04.750
It's too late.

12:04.833 --> 12:06.916
That recording studio needs
to be booked at least a month ahead.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.458
If A-Lin finds out we didn't book it,
we're doomed.

12:09.541 --> 12:10.458
What should we do?

12:11.750 --> 12:13.458
I'll go to the studio now to beg them.

12:13.541 --> 12:15.375
I'm sorry.

12:15.458 --> 12:16.583
I'm sorry.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.791
SURGERY FEE 573,560 DOLLARS
12 MONTHS, 47,797 PER MONTH

12:31.875 --> 12:33.750
SALARY: 13,000 LEFT
DEPOSIT: 110,000

12:38.416 --> 12:39.750
Thank you.

12:41.166 --> 12:43.416
Okay, I know. I owe you one.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.041
Okay, bye.

12:49.625 --> 12:51.708
The recording studio called to complain,

12:51.791 --> 12:54.125
but they're still willing
to squeeze us in.

12:54.625 --> 12:56.208
That's great.

12:56.291 --> 12:58.041
When I went
to the recording studio earlier,

12:58.125 --> 13:00.375
they wouldn't arrange
a schedule for me at all.

13:00.458 --> 13:02.916
Afterward, I asked
who booked the recording studio that day.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.750
I went to their company
and begged them for so long

13:05.833 --> 13:07.916
until they've agreed to discuss it.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.666
So I came back.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.083
I'm sorry.

13:13.166 --> 13:14.250
Okay.

13:14.333 --> 13:16.416
Go get some boxes
and clean up your desk then.

13:18.250 --> 13:19.708
Po-han, I'm sorry.

13:19.791 --> 13:21.166
I won't forget next time.

13:21.250 --> 13:22.958
Please don't fire me now.

13:23.041 --> 13:24.958
-I'm sorry.
-I told you to clean up your desk.

13:25.583 --> 13:27.333
Your desk is as messy as your house.

13:27.416 --> 13:28.333
What?

13:29.875 --> 13:30.958
Okay.

13:32.125 --> 13:34.416
Don't bring personal matters
to work from now on.

13:34.500 --> 13:35.666
Do you understand?

13:35.750 --> 13:36.666
Yes.

13:40.875 --> 13:43.458
How's your son?

13:46.833 --> 13:48.875
There's no problem so far.

13:49.666 --> 13:50.791
We're just

13:52.000 --> 13:53.375
scheduling the surgery.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.791
Do you need help

13:58.333 --> 13:59.666
with the surgery fee then?

14:00.250 --> 14:01.291
There's no need.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.041
I borrowed some money from my parents.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.500
I'll figure out the rest.

14:06.666 --> 14:07.583
Okay.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.750
Let me know if you need help.

14:12.291 --> 14:13.333
Thank you.

14:14.083 --> 14:16.250
Then come with me to Pop Hit tomorrow.

14:17.833 --> 14:19.166
To see Pang?

14:20.875 --> 14:23.708
To see someone I don't want to see
when it's not necessary.

14:24.333 --> 14:27.125
But he should know something
about the copyright.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.875
Come to work on time tomorrow.

14:29.958 --> 14:30.875
Okay.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.416
Have you finished reading the diary?

14:41.708 --> 14:43.375
Where do I have time for that?

14:48.333 --> 14:49.833
I'll go ahead then.

15:08.333 --> 15:09.666
Why are you awake?

15:10.291 --> 15:12.083
I'm going to the restroom.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.083
Okay.

15:22.875 --> 15:24.041
<i>After graduation,</i>

15:24.125 --> 15:26.708
<i>I had been looking
for a job related to music,</i>

15:27.208 --> 15:29.375
<i>so Pang recommended me to Pop Hit.</i>

15:41.750 --> 15:43.125
Do you understand what I said?

15:43.208 --> 15:46.083
Among the four,
choose one that has future potential.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.416
Choose one.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.000
"One that has future potential"?

15:51.500 --> 15:52.708
Can I hear them again?

15:52.791 --> 15:54.833
Make your choice now.

15:56.416 --> 15:57.500
Okay.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.041
I choose…

16:38.250 --> 16:39.125
I choose this one.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.666
I think this has

16:40.750 --> 16:42.125
the most future potential.

16:42.208 --> 16:43.041
This one?

16:45.666 --> 16:46.666
What's your name?

16:47.541 --> 16:48.541
I'm Chang Che-kai.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.083
Chang Che-kai, okay.

16:50.166 --> 16:51.666
Come to work tomorrow, okay?

16:53.958 --> 16:55.958
Not bad, this is the right choice.

16:56.041 --> 16:57.500
This really has a future.

17:01.416 --> 17:02.625
<i>You're home?</i>

17:02.708 --> 17:04.458
Wash your hands,
put your stuff down, and eat.

17:04.541 --> 17:06.250
Gosh, it smells great!

17:06.750 --> 17:08.208
<i>While doing the work you like,</i>

17:08.291 --> 17:09.625
<i>time goes by so fast.</i>

17:09.708 --> 17:11.375
Because today is your turn
to wash the dishes.

17:12.041 --> 17:13.750
<i>But I'm a bit worried about Cream.</i>

17:13.833 --> 17:15.458
This is expensive. The seller charged

17:15.541 --> 17:17.500
<i>-For the past two years,</i>
-five dollars, next time…

17:17.583 --> 17:20.416
<i>she hasn't found something
she really wants to do.</i>

17:20.958 --> 17:21.916
What do you think?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.750
-It's really more delicious.
-Drink this too.

17:26.166 --> 17:27.708
You remembered to add salt today, right?

17:27.791 --> 17:29.708
Yes, I added half a pack.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.333
<i>Every time I asked her
what she wanted to do,</i>

17:36.416 --> 17:37.458
It's so good.

17:37.541 --> 17:39.208
-Hurry.
<i>-she would say she wasn't sure.</i>

17:39.875 --> 17:41.125
-Ready.
-Ready.

17:41.666 --> 17:42.583
<i>However,</i>

17:42.666 --> 17:44.583
<i>she said she was sure of one thing.</i>

17:45.333 --> 17:46.166
<i>She wants us</i>

17:46.250 --> 17:47.666
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

17:47.750 --> 17:50.291
<i>to always celebrate
each other's birthdays.</i>

17:53.000 --> 17:54.500
Why did you give me the same gift?

17:55.625 --> 17:58.166
Because I want us to listen
to the song I wrote together.

17:59.666 --> 18:01.083
Then why did you give me the same gift?

18:01.666 --> 18:04.333
I thought that since you're working
for a recording company,

18:04.416 --> 18:05.958
you should use a better one.

18:07.125 --> 18:08.666
"Listen to the song you wrote"?

18:08.750 --> 18:11.250
But you can't sing.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.291
Are you a better singer?

18:14.375 --> 18:15.458
Of course, I sing well.

18:15.541 --> 18:16.708
I'm a mini A-Lin.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.125
What?

18:26.166 --> 18:27.041
<i>Maybe it was because</i>

18:27.125 --> 18:29.708
<i>I had good taste
in choosing Catgirl Bonnie,</i>

18:29.791 --> 18:32.083
<i>but Mr. Chi seems to like me a lot.</i>

18:33.125 --> 18:35.041
<i>He knows that I want to write songs,</i>

18:35.125 --> 18:37.333
<i>so he encourages me to compose them.</i>

18:39.166 --> 18:41.916
<i>But I'm really not good</i>

18:42.500 --> 18:44.000
<i>at writing lyrics.</i>

18:54.541 --> 18:55.458
You wrote this?

18:56.625 --> 18:58.625
-It's not bad.
-Really?

18:59.125 --> 19:00.416
Mr. Chi said that he wants this song

19:00.500 --> 19:02.625
to be the third title track of Catgirl.

19:03.958 --> 19:05.500
Catgirl?

19:06.166 --> 19:07.541
Isn't that a waste?

19:07.625 --> 19:09.458
You don't even know who she is.

19:09.541 --> 19:11.458
That's a ridiculous stage name.

19:12.041 --> 19:12.875
I feel like

19:12.958 --> 19:15.416
she pretends to be
a cute, young girl daily.

19:15.916 --> 19:17.166
Are your lyrics,

19:17.250 --> 19:19.500
"Meow, meow, meow, I love you,"
and the like?

19:20.333 --> 19:21.875
I think that after you meet her,

19:21.958 --> 19:23.000
you'll like her.

19:23.583 --> 19:24.791
How is that possible?

19:29.083 --> 19:31.375
"I accidentally met you.

19:31.458 --> 19:33.583
Thunder struck my heart."

19:36.375 --> 19:37.625
Isn't this too straightforward?

19:37.708 --> 19:39.166
There's nothing romantic about it.

19:39.250 --> 19:40.333
As a Chinese major,

19:40.416 --> 19:41.541
what's romantic to you?

20:16.333 --> 20:17.416
You haven't seen this, right?

20:17.500 --> 20:18.666
A fishing rod that looks like a pen.

20:20.625 --> 20:21.666
It was so finely made.

20:22.541 --> 20:24.375
For the lyrics…

20:24.458 --> 20:25.583
The lyrics?

20:26.666 --> 20:28.125
For the lyrics…

20:29.750 --> 20:32.000
For the lyrics…

20:33.708 --> 20:35.750
Actually, I don't have a problem
with the lyrics.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.125
As long as Bonnie likes it,

20:38.208 --> 20:39.333
there's no problem.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.750
Then does Bonnie…

20:42.833 --> 20:45.708
Who's calling Bonnie?

21:05.916 --> 21:07.541
Bonnie, let me introduce you.

21:07.625 --> 21:09.291
-She is--
-I know.

21:09.375 --> 21:11.291
You're Cream,
the one who wrote the lyrics for me.

21:13.166 --> 21:14.833
You're Catgirl?

21:16.541 --> 21:17.666
What's the matter?

21:17.750 --> 21:19.083
Do you have a problem with that?

21:34.833 --> 21:37.125
So the one you didn't want
to ask a favor from

21:37.208 --> 21:38.166
is Mr. Chi?

21:40.833 --> 21:42.250
You're not aware that Po-han

21:42.333 --> 21:43.750
is the sweetest.

21:43.833 --> 21:45.250
He hates

21:45.750 --> 21:47.500
causing trouble for people.

21:49.083 --> 21:53.458
<i>I love you in my dreams</i>

21:53.541 --> 21:55.333
<i>In the dream, our hands are entwined</i>

21:55.416 --> 21:57.958
<i>You undid my buttons without saying a word</i>

21:58.041 --> 21:59.750
<i>-You said--</i>
-Forget that you changed the lyrics.

21:59.833 --> 22:01.000
You even turned it into a rap.

22:01.083 --> 22:02.416
Don't you think that's very strange?

22:02.500 --> 22:04.875
My way of expressing
my feelings is through rap.

22:04.958 --> 22:07.708
Senseless people like you
won't understand.

22:07.791 --> 22:10.041
I can allow my artists to have sense,

22:10.125 --> 22:11.750
but not the kind that you have.

22:11.833 --> 22:13.625
This is a love song, miss.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.625
-A love song, you know?
-Hey.

22:15.708 --> 22:16.791
Let Bonnie sing

22:16.875 --> 22:19.000
the way she wants to.

22:19.083 --> 22:20.125
RESIGNATION LETTER

22:20.208 --> 22:21.458
I quit.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.208
Entertain that Hello Kitty yourself.

22:24.416 --> 22:26.166
My goodness. Why are you so cocky?

22:27.500 --> 22:28.416
Mr. Chi.

22:28.500 --> 22:29.791
I was too impulsive.

22:30.875 --> 22:32.875
This is a small token of my gratitude.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.416
I wonder if you know something

22:36.500 --> 22:38.333
about this song's copyright.

22:38.416 --> 22:40.708
What information do you want from me?

22:40.791 --> 22:42.666
I don't have the information.

22:43.458 --> 22:44.750
However,

22:44.833 --> 22:46.125
Bonnie might know.

22:46.750 --> 22:48.250
Back then, Bonnie and Cream

22:48.333 --> 22:50.500
became good friends
through writing song lyrics.

22:50.583 --> 22:51.666
Did you know about this?

22:53.208 --> 22:54.458
I don't.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.916
I forgot. You only worked here
for a short period of time.

23:01.416 --> 23:02.750
Well, Mr. Chi, excuse me.

23:03.250 --> 23:05.125
When will Bonnie be back?

23:08.833 --> 23:10.958
Bonnie ran away from home recently.

23:11.041 --> 23:13.250
What? She ran away from home?

23:13.333 --> 23:14.791
Why are you so surprised?

23:14.875 --> 23:16.833
Haven't you fought
with your boyfriend before?

23:17.333 --> 23:19.083
And let me tell you.
I'm sure Bonnie loves me.

23:19.166 --> 23:20.083
Look.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.541
She specially sent
these specialty items from the south.

23:25.791 --> 23:27.125
All right, An Yi-chi.

23:27.750 --> 23:29.125
Let's not waste time.

23:29.208 --> 23:30.041
Okay.

23:31.875 --> 23:33.208
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Chi.

23:33.291 --> 23:34.833
Can you let us know
when Bonnie comes back?

23:34.916 --> 23:35.875
Miss.

23:35.958 --> 23:39.000
I might not be familiar
with checking copyrights.

23:39.083 --> 23:40.708
But if you want me to find someone,

23:40.791 --> 23:42.333
I'll find it for you right away.

23:42.416 --> 23:43.875
-Find someone?
-Yes.

23:43.958 --> 23:45.250
Back then, for Cream's sake,

23:45.333 --> 23:47.875
K especially asked me
to look into someone.

23:54.458 --> 23:56.000
You said you'd give me a discount.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.708
Now, it's this expensive.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.666
You can't go above the market price

24:00.750 --> 24:02.500
just because someone
is offering a higher price than me.

24:07.291 --> 24:09.041
I can't postpone my exhibit.

24:11.291 --> 24:13.250
Do you have any integrity?

24:14.791 --> 24:15.625
What happened?

24:15.708 --> 24:17.833
The price of the exhibition venue
suddenly skyrocketed.

24:17.916 --> 24:20.166
They said that a popular artist

24:20.250 --> 24:21.750
is booking the place for two weeks.

24:22.333 --> 24:25.208
So I have to pay the same amount
as the other person to use it.

24:25.291 --> 24:26.416
How can they do that?

24:29.125 --> 24:30.250
I can help you.

24:33.750 --> 24:36.333
Your priority now
is to do the exhibit well.

24:37.083 --> 24:39.458
When you become famous,
no one would dare to do this to you.

24:42.083 --> 24:43.458
I have a present for you.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.208
This is too expensive.

25:03.333 --> 25:04.791
I can't accept it.

25:04.875 --> 25:06.166
Don't feel pressured.

25:06.250 --> 25:08.875
Treat it as an investment
for a rising star in photography.

25:37.083 --> 25:38.291
My smile looked so silly.

25:38.375 --> 25:39.541
Who says so?

25:43.125 --> 25:44.125
Thank you.

26:05.500 --> 26:06.708
Don't forget to send
the newly-printed model

26:06.791 --> 26:08.166
-to the District Office.
-Okay.

26:08.250 --> 26:09.083
-It's a rush order.
-Yes.

26:09.166 --> 26:10.625
-The customer kept following up.
-Okay, I got it.

26:12.166 --> 26:13.291
Yu-hsien.

26:14.250 --> 26:15.416
I want to talk to you.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.083
Break up with Cindy.

26:21.375 --> 26:22.250
Why?

26:22.333 --> 26:25.166
What you need is someone mature
who can help you.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.916
It's best if she can
help you run the clinic.

26:27.625 --> 26:30.333
She's always hanging around out there.

26:30.416 --> 26:32.416
How can her art help you?

26:33.125 --> 26:35.458
You're not young anymore.

26:35.541 --> 26:37.916
You don't have time
to pick the wrong person.

26:41.166 --> 26:43.000
I'll take responsibility for the clinic.

26:44.125 --> 26:45.166
I really like her.

26:45.250 --> 26:46.916
Can you stop interfering in my business?

26:47.791 --> 26:49.666
Take responsibility? How can you do that?

26:50.250 --> 26:51.541
I opened the clinic for you.

26:51.625 --> 26:53.750
It reached this scale
only because of my management.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.500
I want you to break up with her.

26:56.583 --> 26:58.083
Why are you giving me so many reasons?

26:59.583 --> 27:00.916
Don't waste any more time.

27:02.208 --> 27:04.458
Next, I'll introduce you to some girls.

27:20.416 --> 27:24.166
<i>Meow, meow, meow, meow, love me
Meow, meow, meow</i>

27:24.250 --> 27:27.833
<i>The world is in slow motion too</i>

27:27.916 --> 27:31.916
<i>Meow, meow, meow, meow, stay with me
Meow, meow, meow</i>

27:32.000 --> 27:34.125
<i>You are my forever</i>

27:34.208 --> 27:36.666
-Bonnie is singing so well.
-Really? Thank you for your hard work.

27:37.166 --> 27:39.541
Bonnie, my dear.
Do you want to get some rest?

27:40.666 --> 27:42.333
Bonnie, you're the best. It's so nice.

27:43.125 --> 27:43.958
Let me tell you.

27:44.041 --> 27:45.250
When this song is released,

27:45.333 --> 27:47.541
I guarantee it will sell
at least 100,000 records.

27:49.166 --> 27:50.458
Excuse me.

27:50.541 --> 27:52.541
For "You're my support,"
why was it changed

27:53.041 --> 27:54.583
to "You're my forever"?

27:55.666 --> 27:57.250
"Support" is too boring.

27:57.333 --> 27:59.333
"Forever" is more romantic.

28:00.041 --> 28:01.375
Where's the romantic part?

28:02.166 --> 28:05.791
Love is in the air with "forever."

28:05.875 --> 28:07.708
-Is that okay?
-Yes.

28:07.791 --> 28:09.375
You can change it to whatever you want.

28:09.958 --> 28:11.500
Of course not.

28:11.583 --> 28:13.125
"Forever" is not this song's attitude.

28:13.708 --> 28:15.041
What's with your attitude now?

28:15.125 --> 28:17.208
Who are you to be making such a fuss here?

28:17.291 --> 28:18.458
Why can't I speak?

28:18.541 --> 28:20.083
I'm the lyricist of this song.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.083
Bonnie is your boss.

28:21.166 --> 28:22.666
If she tells you to change it, do it.

28:25.625 --> 28:26.625
Do you insist on changing it?

28:28.708 --> 28:30.041
I'll change it for you.

28:30.916 --> 28:32.125
Hey.

28:33.833 --> 28:35.333
Why did you come in, Rookie?

28:35.416 --> 28:37.125
You weird Hello Kitty!

28:40.125 --> 28:41.916
She called me Hello Kitty.

28:50.291 --> 28:51.458
I'm home.

29:10.833 --> 29:13.541
Ding-dong, is anyone home?

29:23.083 --> 29:24.250
Stop crying.

29:25.458 --> 29:26.583
What's wrong?

29:27.625 --> 29:29.958
Are you covering yourself this way
because you want to get married?

29:32.791 --> 29:34.583
It's all because of that Catgirl.

29:34.666 --> 29:36.416
She changed my lyrics to "forever."

29:36.500 --> 29:37.666
"Forever" sounds so cheap.

29:40.125 --> 29:41.375
And then?

29:43.208 --> 29:44.208
Then I…

29:46.208 --> 29:47.458
She punched me.

29:48.958 --> 29:50.375
If you fight with Catgirl,

29:50.458 --> 29:51.791
you'll surely be at a disadvantage.

29:54.958 --> 29:57.500
Anyway, I can't accept "forever."

29:58.583 --> 30:00.041
I can only accept "the next life."

30:03.291 --> 30:04.541
"The next life"?

30:05.875 --> 30:08.291
"The next life" feels like a promise.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.416
But "forever" isn't.

30:10.500 --> 30:13.541
If one of them is gone,
there's no forever anymore.

30:15.875 --> 30:16.875
Yes.

30:19.333 --> 30:20.625
Let me ask you.

30:21.208 --> 30:23.666
If there's a next life,
what do you want to be?

30:25.500 --> 30:26.416
A human.

30:27.750 --> 30:29.791
Nonsense. Who doesn't want to be human?

30:29.875 --> 30:30.708
Be serious.

30:30.791 --> 30:32.583
Okay. I'll be serious.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.166
If I have a next life,

30:36.250 --> 30:37.458
I want to be--

30:37.541 --> 30:38.916
Hey, wait.

30:42.250 --> 30:43.500
Okay, you can say it now.

30:46.666 --> 30:48.416
If I have a next life,

30:49.541 --> 30:51.083
I want to be an earring.

30:53.083 --> 30:54.250
An earring?

30:56.291 --> 30:57.625
Or perhaps…

30:58.875 --> 30:59.833
Eyeglasses,

31:01.250 --> 31:02.375
a notebook,

31:03.750 --> 31:04.708
or a bed.

31:05.416 --> 31:07.166
Why do you want to be them?

31:08.208 --> 31:10.291
Then I can stay by your side every day.

31:10.375 --> 31:11.958
You're so disgusting.

31:12.041 --> 31:13.458
You're the disgusting one.

31:13.541 --> 31:15.583
That's how the lyrics of love songs are.

31:15.666 --> 31:17.166
I'm helping you find some inspiration.

31:18.208 --> 31:19.375
I'm not inspired now.

31:19.458 --> 31:20.708
I'm hungry.

31:22.208 --> 31:23.583
Make me some noodles.

31:37.375 --> 31:42.583
<i>Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow…</i>

31:42.666 --> 31:45.875
<i>Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow…</i>

31:52.750 --> 31:54.083
My dear.

31:55.041 --> 31:56.500
You still don't like it?

32:00.916 --> 32:04.041
I really like it!

32:04.125 --> 32:06.708
"You're my support"
became "You shine for me."

32:06.791 --> 32:08.750
It sounds so shiny, right?

32:08.833 --> 32:10.500
And "In Instagram and Facebook,

32:10.583 --> 32:12.500
please follow my beauty
in the next life too."

32:12.583 --> 32:14.375
It's talking about me.

32:15.083 --> 32:16.791
Cream, you're a genius!

32:18.708 --> 32:19.875
Well, Bonnie.

32:19.958 --> 32:21.541
I didn't mean what I did last time.

32:21.625 --> 32:22.916
I'm sorry.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.208
I forgive you.

32:24.291 --> 32:26.583
I know that writing such a good song

32:26.666 --> 32:28.791
is a very difficult thing to do.

32:29.916 --> 32:31.208
Cream!

32:31.291 --> 32:34.041
Write all the lyrics
for me from now on, okay?

32:35.125 --> 32:37.416
-Of course.
-Here, pinky promise.

32:49.375 --> 32:50.458
How did it go?

32:50.958 --> 32:52.250
Did Bonnie like it?

32:52.791 --> 32:53.875
She loved it.

32:53.958 --> 32:56.250
She wants this
to be the title track for her album.

32:57.125 --> 32:58.458
The title track?

32:59.833 --> 33:01.791
Why are you so incredible?

33:02.833 --> 33:04.708
Let's go. Dinner is my treat tonight.

33:04.791 --> 33:06.625
I want to have some barbecue.

33:27.541 --> 33:29.125
Ms. Yu.

33:29.625 --> 33:31.000
Jessica.

33:31.083 --> 33:34.041
-You didn't think I would come, right?
-Yes.

33:34.125 --> 33:36.333
-You asked her to come?
-Hi.

33:36.416 --> 33:38.083
-Did she come by your invitation?
-I'm sorry.

33:38.958 --> 33:39.875
I'm sorry.

33:41.916 --> 33:43.041
This is…

34:02.625 --> 34:03.791
Cindy.

34:05.708 --> 34:07.041
Meeting you

34:08.000 --> 34:09.875
was the biggest accident of my life,

34:10.875 --> 34:12.333
but it was also the best accident.

34:17.208 --> 34:18.208
I want

34:19.291 --> 34:22.000
to continue that in our future life.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.458
Cindy.

34:31.666 --> 34:33.250
Will you marry me?

34:55.166 --> 34:56.333
Yes.

35:15.791 --> 35:17.458
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

35:32.458 --> 35:33.375
Rinse your mouth.

35:37.416 --> 35:39.041
You took good care
of your teeth this time.

35:39.541 --> 35:40.625
Please continue that.

35:40.708 --> 35:43.458
I have no choice,
I'm worried about getting an infection.

35:44.458 --> 35:46.291
But you still had some tartar.

35:46.791 --> 35:48.666
I cleaned them very carefully.
I didn't cause any bleeding.

35:48.750 --> 35:49.833
-Don't worry too much.
-Okay.

35:51.375 --> 35:52.666
By the way,

35:53.166 --> 35:54.291
when brushing your teeth,

35:54.375 --> 35:56.083
remember to do it softly
and not hurt your gums.

35:56.166 --> 35:57.458
-Okay.
-Good.

35:58.458 --> 36:00.333
<i>Take care of your own dinner.</i>

36:00.416 --> 36:02.875
<i>Bonnie is taking me to eat crabs.</i>

36:05.291 --> 36:08.000
<i>-You food monster.</i>
-Let's meet again

36:08.083 --> 36:10.083
after six months for an examination.

36:19.541 --> 36:20.416
I'm sorry.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.416
-After six months?
-After six months.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.125
I heard from my dad
that you're a musician.

36:27.166 --> 36:28.416
Do you write songs?

36:28.500 --> 36:30.708
No, I'm still quite a rookie.

36:30.791 --> 36:33.416
But a song of mine
was released as a title track recently.

36:33.500 --> 36:34.750
I'll give you the CD as a gift.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.125
Gosh, then you have to sign on it.

36:37.208 --> 36:38.416
-Me?
-Yes.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.708
It's more valuable if the singer signs it.

36:41.375 --> 36:42.666
You signing it has a different meaning.

36:45.791 --> 36:47.208
Your dad is retired now?

36:47.791 --> 36:49.208
When I came last time,
he gave me a checkup.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.625
My dad was planning
to retire a long time ago.

36:52.208 --> 36:54.875
He wanted to retire
when I came to help out three years ago.

36:55.625 --> 36:57.750
But he still comes by
from time to time now.

37:01.166 --> 37:02.333
Mr. Chang.

37:03.208 --> 37:04.458
Mr. Chang.

37:05.708 --> 37:07.500
Call an ambulance. Hurry!

42:41.041 --> 42:45.250

"MORE THAN BLUE"
