Teens are like Soviet
Russia -- it's impossible to
know what's really going on.

08:19.266 --> 08:23.537
But you, you can get behind
the emotional iron curtain.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.606
Ben --
When you were her age,
wouldn't it have helped

08:25.639 --> 08:27.107
if somebody knew what was
really going on with you?

08:27.140 --> 08:29.042
It's fair to say
there are some mistakes

08:29.076 --> 08:31.244
that could have been avoided.
And here's the beauty --

08:31.278 --> 08:34.014
you can find out who she's with
and what she's doing

08:34.047 --> 08:35.849
and your identity
remains secret.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.118
You're just a spook
working for the company.

[ Breathes deeply ]
That means CIA.

08:39.887 --> 08:42.022

I watch "Homeland" with you.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.725
I know this sounds crazy,
but I just want to know...
Mm-hmm.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.594
that she's safe.

[ Sighs ]
Okay, fine.

Now?

09:13.186 --> 09:15.222

09:28.969 --> 09:30.237
[ Sighs ]

09:31.371 --> 09:33.641
So, at sundown,

09:33.674 --> 09:35.609
the Solar Car Club
did a presentation

09:35.643 --> 09:37.277
about the founder
of Tesla.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.179
They called it
"Musk at Dusk."

09:39.212 --> 09:41.214
Needless to say,
it was amazing.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.350
Of course, they're the dope-est
science org on campus.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.986
But after, I kind of felt
like Mason was freezing me out.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.622
And then, later,
Stacy texted him "good show,"

09:48.656 --> 09:51.625
and he texted back
three prayer hands.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.861
Does Mason like Stacy?
She knows I'm into him.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.729
Dude, Stacy had
her turn at bat,jj

09:55.763 --> 09:58.766
and she went with
a very pedestrian "good show."

09:58.799 --> 10:02.035
But what
are you gonna say?

10:02.069 --> 10:04.337
Y-You think
I should just...text him?

10:04.371 --> 10:07.240
Absolutely.
Just be yourself.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.376
If he's not into that,
he is not worth it.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.944

I hope you're right.

[ Laughs ]

10:16.016 --> 10:18.318
Can I have some privacy,
please?

10:18.351 --> 10:19.820
Of course.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.360

Is she okay?

10:27.394 --> 10:28.361
Good news, Ben.
Actually...

10:28.395 --> 10:30.030
"Agent Strong Jaw."

Gave myself a code name.
Still working on yours.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.202
Okay, do you want to
know who she's with and
what she's up to or not?

10:35.235 --> 10:37.104
Yes, please, tell me.
I do.
Okay, no need to worry.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.006
Just a classic case
of "Musk at Dusk,"

Yeah. Nothing to worry about.

What are you doing?

10:59.026 --> 11:00.994
Oh, just, just keeping track
of all the information.

11:01.028 --> 11:01.862
It's like a notebook --

11:01.895 --> 11:03.831
or a dossier
if we want to be accurate.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.766
I feel like we shouldn't
have a paper trail.

I feel like I shouldn't
have to say that.

safe from these lusting,

We know who she's with.
We know what she's up to.
