00:02.880 --> 00:04.757
Previously on Enterprise:

00:05.920 --> 00:08.354
From what I've heard about these
Romulans, they mean business.

00:08.480 --> 00:10.630
We have to find some way to stop them
or next time...

00:10.760 --> 00:12.830
they might come back
with a thousand of those ships.

00:13.200 --> 00:16.875
Unless this murderer meets me
in combat...

00:17.360 --> 00:20.477
your precious alliance is finished!

00:21.240 --> 00:24.676
The ambassador has decided
to fight in place of his underling.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.274
Not the ambassador.

00:33.040 --> 00:36.510
Trip, Malcolm, we can make one more
pass. Get the hell out of there.

00:38.480 --> 00:39.515
They're clear.

00:41.040 --> 00:44.669
-Drone has re-entered Romulan space.
-Disconnect the pilot.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.478
I believe we have more to discuss
than trade disputes.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.399
There's no reason
our people can't become allies.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.032
And now the conclusion.

01:00.280 --> 01:03.397
This mission was supposed to cause
dissension in the region.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.272
It's had the opposite effect.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.869
Senator, you have a right--

01:07.000 --> 01:09.878
The Andorians and Tellarites
have formed an alliance.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.680
They're working together
for the first time in history.

01:12.800 --> 01:13.949
It won't last.

01:14.560 --> 01:17.472
The group of senators
doesn't share your optimism.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.560
They're presenting a motion
to cancel this mission.

01:20.680 --> 01:21.999
That would be a mistake.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.237
The mistake was mine
when I supported this endeavour.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.832
Do you realise
how you've weakened my position?

01:29.200 --> 01:31.839
When this is over,
you'll be First Consul.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.755
After a failure of this magnitude...

01:36.120 --> 01:38.680
-I could be dead.
-This isn't a failure.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.799
It's a setback.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.037
We have to deal with the humans.

01:43.160 --> 01:46.232
They're the ones that brought
the Andorians and Tellarites together.

01:46.360 --> 01:49.238
The second Drone ship is armed
and ready for battle.

01:49.480 --> 01:52.392
With two ships,
I can deliver a devastating blow.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.316
We will hunt down
Enterprise and destroy it.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.589
It's been a long road

02:04.320 --> 02:06.356
Gettin' from there to here

02:07.680 --> 02:09.318
It's been a long time

02:11.120 --> 02:14.237
But my time is finally near

02:14.920 --> 02:18.310
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

02:19.240 --> 02:21.913
I will touch the sky

02:22.200 --> 02:25.954
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

02:26.240 --> 02:28.879
No, they're not gonna change my mind

02:29.400 --> 02:33.154
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:34.120 --> 02:36.680
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:36.800 --> 02:40.713
I've got faith to believe

02:41.160 --> 02:43.993
I can do anything

02:44.120 --> 02:47.908
I've got strength of the soul

02:48.520 --> 02:51.398
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:51.520 --> 02:55.479
I can reach any star

02:57.000 --> 02:58.956
I've got faith

03:00.720 --> 03:03.439
I've got faith

03:04.440 --> 03:07.671
Faith of the heart

03:09.000 --> 03:15.074

03:17.320 --> 03:19.231
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

03:19.520 --> 03:23.229
A transport ship is returning the
Tellarite ambassador to his homeworld.

03:23.520 --> 03:27.399
But Shran has offered to stay
and help us track down the marauder.

03:28.560 --> 03:31.358
The Drone is being operated
by telepresence.

03:33.080 --> 03:37.073
It's a process which allows a vessel
to be controlled from a remote location.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.431
We experimented with that years ago.
Nothing came of it.

03:41.680 --> 03:46.071
A pilot can operate the Drone from
a great distance, over many light-years.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.639
So, there really was no one on that ship.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.997
And the people running it are back on
their homeworld, safe and sound.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.997
-Essentially.
-Doesn't seem fair.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.908
Is there any way
to interrupt this telepresence?

03:58.040 --> 04:00.508
I'm still reviewing the data
Commander Tucker brought back.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.837
But I believe we can construct
our own telepresence unit.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.560
-And use it to hijack their ship?
-Doubtful.

04:06.800 --> 04:10.110
The most we can hope for
is to interfere with their navigation.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.515
-Get started.
-There is one problem.

04:12.840 --> 04:16.196
The data from the marauder
also contained a brainwave pattern.

04:16.720 --> 04:19.358
-I believe it belongs to the pilot.
-I've analyzed it.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.834
The individual is highly telepathic.

04:22.160 --> 04:25.630
Apparently, telepathy is necessary
to operate the device.

04:27.120 --> 04:30.749
-Vulcans have telepathic powers.
-Not to this extent.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.678
Can you identify the species?

04:32.800 --> 04:35.075
There's no exact match in my database.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.670
However, the nearest genome
is Andorian.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.509
The humans did considerable damage
to the Bridge.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.517
We'll have to replace
the entire receiver array.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.631
Assign every spare man to
the repair crew.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.910
The ship isn't what concerns me.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.158
-It's the pilot.
-What about him?

04:57.280 --> 04:59.794
Operating the vessel is
extremely taxing.

04:59.920 --> 05:02.673
-He'll have at least three days to rest.
-That won't be enough.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.030
He's suffering from
severe mental fatigue.

05:05.160 --> 05:08.630
Piloting one ship would be
difficult enough, but two....

05:08.760 --> 05:13.151
-You'll have to increase the stimulants.
-Dosage is already at a dangerous level.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.874
He could be permanently damaged.
He could die.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.150
If I didn't know you better,
I'd say you're more concerned...

05:18.280 --> 05:20.635
with this creature's well-being
than you are with this mission.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.638
Without the pilot,
there would be no mission.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.598
Just keep him alive long enough
to destroy the Earth ship.

05:26.720 --> 05:29.314
After that,
his health is of little consequence.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.269
Come in.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.115
I just received a transmission.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.159
Our scientists identified
the brainwave pattern.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.235
And?

05:42.360 --> 05:45.716
It's from my world, but it's not from
any Andorian you'd know.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.319
It's Aenar.

05:48.760 --> 05:51.877
They're a kind of subspecies.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.271
Blind ice-dwellers.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.793
For most of our history...

05:55.920 --> 06:00.311
they were considered a myth,
stories we told our children.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.994
But 50 years ago, they were discovered
living in the Northern Wastes.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.390
They're extremely secretive.

06:09.320 --> 06:13.279
I can count on one hand the Andorians
who've seen one face-to-face.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.434
Could they have built a ship
like the marauder?

06:16.880 --> 06:20.190
I seriously doubt they have the capacity.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.589
There are only a few thousand of
them left, and even if they could...

06:24.720 --> 06:27.996
they're pacifists.
They don't believe in violence.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.118
One of them does.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.273
Seems that way.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.829
We need to find out
who's controlling that ship.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.029
Agreed.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.638
-Travis.
-Yes, sir.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.360
Set a course for Andoria.
Maximum warp.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.798
-You should rest.
-I just need a second.

06:55.760 --> 06:58.957
Phlox thinks it's too soon
for you to return to duty.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.149
Phlox?

07:01.040 --> 07:04.271
-You were talking to him about me?
-lt came up in conversation.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.469
Right.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.715
I don't have the option of taking a break.
The Captain needs this done fast.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.159
I can manage.

07:12.280 --> 07:15.158
You might be the best there is
at crunching numbers...

07:15.280 --> 07:19.717
but when it comes to sticking things
together, you're a bit out of your league.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.434
These work better
when you strip off the duranite caps.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.710
Don't ask me why, they just do.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.237
I'll make a note of that.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.714
You know...

07:33.840 --> 07:36.354
when I was on that ship with Malcolm...

07:37.040 --> 07:39.235
I was convinced I was gonna die.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.798
You ever been there?

07:43.600 --> 07:45.716
Since Enterprise was launched...

07:45.840 --> 07:48.991
we've all been near death
on more than one occasion.

07:49.440 --> 07:52.034
I'm not talking close scrapes, I mean...

07:53.120 --> 07:55.395
when you're in a bad situation...

07:55.920 --> 07:58.753
and you know this is it,
there's no way out...

07:59.400 --> 08:02.517
and you have time to think about it.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.478
In the Expanse...

08:09.200 --> 08:12.237
when we were attempting
to destroy Sphere 41...

08:12.880 --> 08:14.950
I didn't believe we'd survive.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.591
What went through your mind?

08:18.120 --> 08:21.510
Whether or not to transfer auxiliary
power to the deflector array.

08:21.640 --> 08:22.914
Why do you ask?

08:26.440 --> 08:27.839
Just curious.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.760
The Aenar compound is surrounded
by a dampening field.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.996
Once you're inside,
you won't be able to contact the ship.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.918
I'd feel much better about this if you'd
take a couple of MACOs with you.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.793
We go in there with a show of force,
we won't get a thing out of them.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.433
We're going alone.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.758
Captain, we don't know anything
about these people.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.633
That's why we're here. Energize.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.273
Taste that air.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.790
Really gets the blood running.

09:12.560 --> 09:15.711
-28 below?
-Lucky for you, it's middle of summer.

09:15.840 --> 09:16.829
Yeah.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.435
The entrance is 20 metres ahead.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.952
The Vulcans say that the desert
teaches men the meaning of endurance.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.873
But it's the ice that forges real strength.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.670
It's hard to believe
anything can survive here.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.119
It isn't easy.

09:32.360 --> 09:36.512
Andorian cities are built underground
to take advantage of geothermal energy.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.676
I didn't see the sun till I was 15.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.308
Careful, Shran, you don't have
your balance back yet.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.078
Hands off, pinkskin.

09:49.960 --> 09:53.111
These tunnels branch out
for thousands of kilometres.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.876
Not a good place to get lost.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.075
We'll be ready to launch in 12 hours.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.032
-And the pilot?
-He's resting.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.998
-Will he be ready?
-I'll make sure that he is.

10:08.120 --> 10:11.510
-Spoken like a soldier.
-I'm a scientist.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.751
We're all soldiers, Nijil...

10:15.480 --> 10:17.471
from the moment we're born.

10:18.120 --> 10:21.157
When we forget that, we invite disaster.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.315
You know I was once a senator?

10:26.120 --> 10:27.075
No.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.757
Many years ago,
Vrax and I were colleagues.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.950
I even considered him a friend.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.355
What happened?

10:35.480 --> 10:39.359
I made the mistake of challenging
the precept of unlimited expansion.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.913
I asked the question:

10:42.520 --> 10:46.479
Is conquest truly
the best course for our people?

10:48.560 --> 10:50.152
And I was expelled.

10:51.160 --> 10:54.232
-I'm sorry.
-I'm not trying to evoke your pity.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.517
I want you to learn from my experience.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.676
When I was led away
from the Senate chamber...

10:58.800 --> 11:00.995
I vowed never to repeat my error...

11:01.440 --> 11:03.908
and never to forget my purpose.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.759
I understand.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.713
Continue with your preparations.

11:18.240 --> 11:21.596
Ice-bores. Worms. They live in the ice.

11:21.800 --> 11:24.075
Generate heat through
a chemical reaction.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.589
Big swarm came through here
a day or two ago.

11:27.040 --> 11:29.679
I'm sure Phlox
would love to get his hands on one.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.392
Best to avoid them.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.909
When I was a boy,
I stumbled into a large den...

11:34.040 --> 11:37.112
wound up with third-degree burns
over half my body.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.638
Shran, listen to me.

11:41.640 --> 11:44.871
-We should find another way.
-Afraid of heights, Captain?

11:57.480 --> 11:58.515
Shran!

12:09.640 --> 12:11.631
The ice gave out beneath me.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.478
You're losing a lot of blood.

12:42.480 --> 12:43.754
Hold still.

12:52.720 --> 12:53.948
Hold still.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.958
Bleeding's stopped.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.874
But if you move, it could start again.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.548
We can't stay here.
We'll freeze to death.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.312
Archer to Enterprise.

13:11.400 --> 13:15.075
-Archer to Enterprise.
-We're well inside the dampening field.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.717
It doesn't hurt to try.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.036
How far are we from the Aenar?

13:28.320 --> 13:30.595
I think we just got a lot closer.

13:40.560 --> 13:41.629
Hello.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.998
We need your help.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.952
My friend's been hurt.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.798
We'll assist you.

14:11.640 --> 14:14.393
There's not as much data
on the neural interface as I'd like.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.748
It's all we have.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.838
I can connect someone to the unit,
but it will be dangerous.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.633
-How dangerous?
-lf the interface malfunctions...

14:21.760 --> 14:25.309
there could be severe neurolytic shock,
possibly resulting in brain damage.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.510
There's got to be some way
we can make it safer.

14:27.640 --> 14:30.632
Diagnostics will only tell us so much,
I'm afraid.

14:30.760 --> 14:32.830
-When can we test it?
-A day.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.035
I want to be the first one to try it out.

14:36.640 --> 14:40.872
You're not telepathic. It wouldn't be a
true measure of the unit's effectiveness.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.949
At least we'll find out
if it causes brain damage.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.672
I'll test the unit.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.634
You're the ranking officer. Too risky.

14:48.760 --> 14:51.877
Considering what's at stake,
the risk is acceptable.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.995
We could at least wait
until the Captain gets back.

14:55.120 --> 14:58.157
Our goal should be to have the unit
ready by the time he returns.

14:58.280 --> 15:01.113
That means conducting
a full series of tests.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.191
The discussion's closed.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.596
We have a lot of work to do.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.957
Your wound is healing well.

15:42.080 --> 15:45.072
You'll be able to walk on your own
in a few hours.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.588
My thanks.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.998
You're Captain Archer.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.232
You can read minds.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.630
We have a strict law here, Captain.

15:57.760 --> 16:01.036
No one may enter another's thoughts
without permission.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.830
I know your name because
the Andorian Chancellor contacted us.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.554
I need to speak with
someone in authority.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.955
We assign our leaders as
the need arises.

16:10.320 --> 16:13.312
For this occasion,
I have been chosen as Speaker.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.436
I take it you know why we're here.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.074
I know what the Andorians have told us.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.315
Someone's been attacking your ships.

16:23.440 --> 16:27.115
-And you believe we're involved.
-It's a bit more complicated than that.

16:27.240 --> 16:31.756
It will save time and foster our trust
if I can have your thoughts.

16:39.800 --> 16:40.994
Go ahead.

16:44.160 --> 16:46.390
You have an interesting mind, Captain.

16:46.520 --> 16:47.794
Many facets.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.348
Thank you.

16:50.840 --> 16:54.753
-Some of those facets are in conflict.
-That explains a lot.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.235
Shran.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.753
The evidence you've gathered
appears irrefutable.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.472
It seems there was an Aenar
controlling that ship.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.271
But you're sceptical.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.195
We're a non-violent people.

17:08.920 --> 17:12.195
That a member of our race
could cause so much death...

17:12.880 --> 17:14.757
it's extremely disturbing.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.513
Do you have any idea who it could be?

17:21.200 --> 17:23.077
There's one possibility.

17:23.760 --> 17:24.749
Who?

17:26.000 --> 17:30.312
A year ago, one of our citizens
disappeared while collecting ice-bores.

17:31.480 --> 17:35.234
We assumed he'd been killed in an
accident, but we never found his body.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.799
Now you know why.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.349
Gareb would not be
doing this voluntarily.

17:39.480 --> 17:42.631
-You think he was abducted?
-It's the best explanation.

17:42.760 --> 17:46.196
It doesn't matter why he's doing it.
He has to be stopped.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.835
This device you're building
aboard your ship....

17:48.960 --> 17:52.270
We're hoping it will disrupt the signal
that's controlling the marauder.

17:52.400 --> 17:56.916
-You will need one of us to operate it.
-You owe us that much, at least.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.110
I'll consult with the others.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.671
Coffee. Strong.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.113
-Commander.
-Hey.

18:32.680 --> 18:33.669
Trip.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.758
I appreciate your concern for my safety.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.678
I just don't want Enterprise
to lose a good officer.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.791
I think you're letting your feelings
impact your work.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.309
My work's as good as it's ever been.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.916
As far as my feelings go...

18:56.280 --> 18:58.271
they're purely professional.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.798
I've never been able to sleep with
someone standing at the foot of my bed.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.756
-I didn't mean to disturb you.
-Actually, I was awake.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.394
What is it?

19:22.680 --> 19:25.592
-I've never met a blueskin.
-You're blind.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.515
How can you tell my skin is blue?

19:31.120 --> 19:34.556
Don't ask me to explain.
I was never very good at science.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.399
Neither was l.

19:37.360 --> 19:41.239
Is it true that where you come from,
the temperature rises above freezing...

19:41.360 --> 19:42.952
for weeks at a time?

19:43.080 --> 19:45.514
Every few years, there's a heat wave.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.636
I've been on worlds
where the temperature...

19:48.760 --> 19:52.389
is only slightly below
the boiling point of water.

19:54.080 --> 19:57.436
-I can't imagine such a place.
-I'm trying to forget it.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.319
I lost 10% of my body weight
in two days.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.877
I came here to apologise.

20:10.080 --> 20:11.274
For what?

20:11.840 --> 20:14.877
When I saw you for the first time,
I sensed some of your thoughts.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.638
I didn't intend to.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.629
It's never been all that hard to figure out
what I'm thinking.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.828
I know what it's like to lose someone.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.310
Gareb, the one who's missing...

20:34.600 --> 20:36.079
he's my brother.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.268
I'm sorry.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.793
He would never hurt anyone,
not intentionally.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.278
So we've been told.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.231
Do you think he's in pain?

20:52.200 --> 20:54.077
There's no way of knowing.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.032
I have nightmares.

20:58.200 --> 21:01.476
Gareb's bound,
locked in a strange cage.

21:02.240 --> 21:03.832
He's calling for me.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.511
He wants me to rescue him.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.279
Forgive me.

21:35.240 --> 21:36.719
How do you feel?

21:37.840 --> 21:39.512
I just need a moment.

21:40.320 --> 21:42.072
Whenever you're ready.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.950
Indicator's moving. Doc?

21:49.640 --> 21:51.119
So far, so good.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.636
I'll be damned, it's working.

21:58.320 --> 21:59.435
She okay?

21:59.560 --> 22:02.518
-Her synaptic response is erratic.
-I'll be fine.

22:08.640 --> 22:11.791
-It's getting worse, Commander.
-That's enough. Shut it down!

22:17.080 --> 22:18.593
You're all right.

22:19.520 --> 22:20.748
It worked.

22:23.160 --> 22:26.436
I'll rest for a few minutes,
and then we'll try again.

22:30.240 --> 22:33.676
You said Gareb was abducted.
If that's true...

22:34.400 --> 22:37.631
-don't you want to help him?
-Not with violence.

22:38.240 --> 22:39.912
We're trying to stop violence.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.838
I won't deny
that your intentions are honorable.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.757
But our decision stands.

22:44.960 --> 22:49.112
Forget it, Captain. They've never even
helped defend their own world.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.797
We're wasting our time.

23:02.360 --> 23:03.759
Systems ready.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.518
Launch the Drones.

23:22.720 --> 23:25.314
-You need to rest.
-I've had enough rest.

23:26.760 --> 23:29.399
We should clear
the dampening field soon.

23:29.560 --> 23:30.595
Wait!

23:31.440 --> 23:32.759
What is it?

23:34.320 --> 23:35.469
A swarm.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.912
I don't see anything.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.673
It'll take a few minutes for them to pass.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.870
Gareb and I loved chasing ice-bores.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.754
Once we followed a swarm for
two hours, caught hundreds of them.

24:07.560 --> 24:11.269
We were almost at the surface.
My family was very worried.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.639
They're going to be worried
about me now.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.110
Are you sure you want to do this?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.991
I won't abandon my brother.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.919
What's it like, your ship?

24:29.200 --> 24:30.269
Warm.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.437
She wants to try again.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.352
You think it's smart?

24:48.720 --> 24:51.678
You know the risks.
So does Commander T'Pol.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.913
Commander...

24:55.880 --> 24:57.518
she's doing her job.

25:01.840 --> 25:05.753
-She's gonna hurt herself.
-Take my advice: don't interfere.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.913
I can't believe
I'm getting this from you now.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.594
Has everyone on this ship gone crazy?

25:12.760 --> 25:14.159
Not everyone.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.879
Oh, I'm crazy?

25:17.040 --> 25:20.510
It's not your fault. As far as I know,
there are no species in the galaxy...

25:20.640 --> 25:24.553
that have mastered the art
of mixing romance and vocation.

25:26.440 --> 25:29.193
You're the last one
that should be giving me a lecture.

25:29.320 --> 25:33.313
-Vulcan neuropressure was your idea.
-You were having trouble sleeping.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.271
What the hell am I gonna do?

25:40.400 --> 25:44.234
This is the one ailment
that is universally untreatable.

25:45.080 --> 25:47.355
You'll have to suffer through it.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.357
We've been here before.

26:02.240 --> 26:04.595
He's right, we're going in circles.

26:06.240 --> 26:08.629
-They're trying to stop us.
-How?

26:08.960 --> 26:11.679
They're not letting us see
the path to the surface.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.756
How could that be possible?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.797
It's time to come back.

26:19.760 --> 26:20.875
I can't.

26:21.840 --> 26:25.230
They're fighting a war.
Do you want to be a part of that?

26:25.760 --> 26:28.479
I don't want to fight anyone.
I want to help my brother.

26:28.600 --> 26:31.478
Help him by standing up
for what we believe in.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.711
She's doing what she thinks is right.

26:33.840 --> 26:36.673
-She's betraying her people.
-That's not true.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.753
Shouldn't she be allowed
to follow her own conscience?

26:40.880 --> 26:44.031
-She's not following her conscience.
-How do you know?

26:44.160 --> 26:45.957
Have you read her mind?

26:46.480 --> 26:48.994
I thought that was against your custom.

26:50.640 --> 26:51.709
Jhamel.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.393
T ake my thoughts.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.868
You're certain this is what you want?

27:07.440 --> 27:08.475
Yes.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.108
Very well.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.791
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.512
We've returned to Enterprise...

27:33.640 --> 27:37.315
where we received word that
the cargo ship Ticonderoga is missing.

27:37.640 --> 27:40.108
-Anything on long-range sensors?
-Not yet.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.514
What's our ETA?

27:41.640 --> 27:44.279
We'll be at their last known coordinates
in six hours.

27:44.400 --> 27:47.073
Tell Malcolm to finish his upgrades
to the targeting scanners.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.237
If we run into that marauder again,
I want to make sure every shot counts.

27:50.360 --> 27:51.588
Understood.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.595
-Report?
-She's good to go.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.112
Whenever you're ready.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.032
I'm ready, Captain.

28:27.280 --> 28:29.919
A lot of movement. 50% spike.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.236
Are you feeling all right?

28:37.680 --> 28:39.750
We can stop anytime you like.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.549
It's strangely enjoyable.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.238
She's maxed it out.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.799
Is that good?

28:55.160 --> 28:56.354
Very good.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.755
Is there another test we can try?

28:59.800 --> 29:02.268
We could simulate a course correction.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.033
Synaptic trouble.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.713
Shut it down!

29:31.840 --> 29:33.637
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

29:33.760 --> 29:37.036
We've arrived at the last known
coordinates of the Ticonderoga.

29:37.520 --> 29:40.034
I'm picking up debris. Hull fragments.

29:41.520 --> 29:42.999
Nacelle casings.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.270
Several bodies, human.

29:46.960 --> 29:50.919
Keep scanning. Try to find
the marauder's warp signature.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.950
Is there any word from Sickbay?

29:56.720 --> 29:58.472
She's going to be okay.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.512
But Phlox says it's too dangerous
to try again.

30:03.680 --> 30:06.478
Looks like we went all the way
to Andoria...

30:08.440 --> 30:09.759
for nothing.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.199
What happened?

30:22.320 --> 30:25.039
You had a convulsion.
You're all right now.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.433
I was dreaming...

30:28.440 --> 30:29.714
about Gareb.

30:33.640 --> 30:35.232
I failed, didn't l?

30:35.440 --> 30:36.714
Ridiculous.

30:38.120 --> 30:41.317
That kind of bravery is never a failure.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.840
I'm a commander in the lmperial Guard.

30:44.960 --> 30:47.758
I'd be afraid to go anywhere near
that thing.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.831
Talas was a fortunate woman.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.597
I was the fortunate one.

31:01.400 --> 31:05.313
-My brother's going to die, isn't he?
-I won't hear that from you.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.197
It's hard to be strong.

31:09.080 --> 31:10.832
You make it look easy.

31:15.560 --> 31:17.118
Keep being strong.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.115
For me.

31:23.080 --> 31:26.629
A ship's dropping out of warp.
It appears to be a Tellarite freighter.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.193
Tactical Alert.

31:29.280 --> 31:30.554
Hail them.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.592
Target their engines.

31:36.280 --> 31:37.952
If it is a freighter.

31:41.240 --> 31:42.434
Anything?

31:47.080 --> 31:48.513
100 kilometres.

31:56.920 --> 31:57.955
Fire.

32:13.760 --> 32:16.115
-Aim for their weapons!
-They're too damn fast.

32:16.240 --> 32:17.958
I can't get a target lock.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.115
What's happening?

32:21.240 --> 32:23.151
We're under attack.
I'm going to the Bridge.

32:23.320 --> 32:24.309
Wait.

32:26.920 --> 32:28.239
I can feel him.

32:30.440 --> 32:31.919
Where do you think you're going?

32:32.040 --> 32:33.758
Take me to the device.
I need to try again.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.599
I can't allow it.
You barely survived the last attempts.

32:36.720 --> 32:39.439
I can reach him. I can make him stop.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.039
Let her try.

32:44.040 --> 32:47.749
-Enterprise is taking heavy damage.
-Target with the second Drone.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.474
Attack vector 177.

32:50.600 --> 32:53.717
-lt may not be necessary.
-Follow my orders.

32:55.360 --> 32:56.713
Yes, Admiral.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.231
Another ship's approaching,
bearing 0-1-6 mark 12.

33:06.920 --> 33:08.433
An Andorian battle cruiser.

33:08.600 --> 33:09.555
T'Pol?

33:09.680 --> 33:12.831
-lts power signature is not Andorian.
-Target them!

33:13.880 --> 33:16.917
Captain, I'm picking up
an energy reading from Sickbay.

33:17.040 --> 33:18.996
It's the telepresence unit.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.791
Archer to Sickbay. What's going on?

33:23.000 --> 33:24.479
Jhamel's going to
make another attempt.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.953
-ls she up to it?
-She's quite insistent.

33:42.920 --> 33:45.559
Cortical fluctuation.
It could trigger a seizure.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.116
-Jhamel.
-I can do it.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.109
-Disconnect her. Now!
-No!

33:53.240 --> 33:54.673
She can do this.

33:56.040 --> 33:59.589
-They've lost warp power.
-Continue targeting their engines.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.515
Someone's tapping into
the telemetric array.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.029
Jhamel?

34:08.920 --> 34:10.034
It's me.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.909
It's not possible. How?

34:13.679 --> 34:15.716
You have to stop what you're doing.

34:16.199 --> 34:17.632
Where are you?

34:18.199 --> 34:20.429
I'm on the ship you're attacking.

34:27.080 --> 34:29.389
Both Drones are coming to a stop.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.878
We're defenceless.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.637
They've stopped firing.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.272
I thought you were dead.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.312
They said I was
the last surviving Aenar.

34:45.280 --> 34:46.793
They lied to you.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.795
I've killed so many people.

34:52.360 --> 34:55.636
It wasn't you.
It was them, they forced you.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.073
You can stop it.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.790
You know what you have to do.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.235
The first Drone is targeting the second!

35:13.360 --> 35:16.193
-T ake all weapons off-line.
-I've lost access.

35:22.200 --> 35:25.033
-They're attacking each other.
-Let's give them a hand.

35:25.160 --> 35:27.913
-Photonic torpedoes. Full spread.
-Aye, sir.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.394
Stop this. Now.

35:33.800 --> 35:34.869
No!

35:35.360 --> 35:37.828
Resume your attack on the Earth ship.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.478
Remember me, Jhamel.

35:41.520 --> 35:42.635
Gareb!

36:34.840 --> 36:36.751
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

36:36.880 --> 36:39.348
There's been no sign
of any other marauder ships.

36:39.480 --> 36:42.199
We're returning
Shran and Jhamel to Andoria.

36:42.680 --> 36:44.591
I want to thank you again.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.838
I owe you thanks.

36:47.880 --> 36:51.429
If I hadn't come with you,
my brother would have died alone.

36:52.480 --> 36:55.313
-Goodbye, Captain.
-Goodbye.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.914
I regret...

37:03.040 --> 37:05.554
much of what happened
between us recently.

37:05.680 --> 37:06.874
Same here.

37:07.480 --> 37:10.995
When you lose your ship, you aren't
usually rewarded with another one.

37:11.120 --> 37:13.111
I may not see you for a while.

37:13.240 --> 37:16.516
If there's anything we can do
or say on your behalf....

37:17.640 --> 37:19.437
I appreciate the offer.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.668
Let's just see what the future brings.

37:29.800 --> 37:32.268
Try to stay out of trouble, pinkskin.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.429
Come in.

37:47.080 --> 37:49.469
I've been looking over your report.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.512
I think you're being
a little hard on yourself.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.712
There's no getting around it.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.559
I missed a 10-degree variance
in the telepresence emitter.

37:57.680 --> 37:59.033
I spoke to Phlox.

37:59.160 --> 38:02.232
He doesn't think it had anything to do
with Jhamel's seizure.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.032
But he can't be sure.

38:05.080 --> 38:09.198
-Either way, I should have caught it.
-We were all under a lot of pressure.

38:09.320 --> 38:12.198
-My mind wasn't on the job.
-lf that were true...

38:13.280 --> 38:16.078
you probably wouldn't be
standing here now.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.396
Captain, I want a transfer.

38:29.480 --> 38:30.549
Where?

38:31.600 --> 38:34.194
Columbia. They need
experienced people.

38:36.720 --> 38:40.110
You've turned them down twice before.
Why now?

38:40.800 --> 38:43.314
I think I can do some good over there.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.592
I need you here, Trip.

38:47.360 --> 38:48.918
They need me more.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.877
What's this really about?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.274
I told you.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.198
I haven't heard one thing
that explains this.

39:05.120 --> 39:07.315
I've said everything I want to.

39:08.120 --> 39:09.348
That's it?

39:13.880 --> 39:15.836
I'm supposed to accept that?

39:19.800 --> 39:21.870
And if I refuse your transfer?

39:24.640 --> 39:25.868
Captain...

39:27.320 --> 39:29.390
as a friend I'm asking you...

39:30.840 --> 39:32.273
Iet me do this.

39:33.440 --> 39:36.113
It's your career, Trip. But as a friend...

39:38.160 --> 39:39.957
I'm asking you to stay.

39:43.560 --> 39:44.754
I can't.

39:47.520 --> 39:48.748
All right.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.228
Thank you.

39:52.840 --> 39:54.114
Dismissed.
