00:07.030 --> 00:08.600
I got one for you, Jamal.

00:08.635 --> 00:09.670
If you could smash any chick,

00:09.705 --> 00:12.070
knowing you'd get a STD,
who would you stick?

00:12.105 --> 00:13.610
That's a tough one, Milk.

00:13.645 --> 00:15.370
Hmm, probably Amber Rose.

00:15.380 --> 00:16.440
You sure about that, my nig?

00:16.475 --> 00:18.280
You really rollin' with
Wiz Khalifa's sloppies?

00:18.315 --> 00:20.880
All that ass?
I'll take the finger like Kanye.

00:20.915 --> 00:23.580
- I hope you don't lick your finger.
- You can hate on a thicky all you want.

00:23.590 --> 00:25.590
I knew you was
a finger-in-the-booty-ass bitch.

00:28.055 --> 00:31.020
You nasty, boo.

00:31.030 --> 00:32.960
Head's up.
Massa coming.

00:32.995 --> 00:35.430
Shoot that, Randy.

00:35.465 --> 00:37.160
Way to use the glass!

00:37.170 --> 00:39.600
Man, [bleep] y'all.
Bring me a towel, bitch.

00:39.635 --> 00:42.470
You sure you don't want a tampon?

00:42.505 --> 00:45.100
At least we finally got our
first high school game coming up.

00:45.110 --> 00:46.740
Our first step to being legends.

00:46.775 --> 00:48.140
Yup, all the beezies finna jock us

00:48.175 --> 00:50.840
when they see us rockin'
our jerseys, my nigs.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.040
We told you, Milk.

00:52.050 --> 00:54.210
Until your white ass proves
you got some black in you,

00:54.220 --> 00:56.080
that word is on
the banned substance list.

00:56.115 --> 00:58.580
- Got it, my nig?
- I told you, I'm Creole.

00:58.590 --> 01:01.220
Man, I'm tired
of all this practice.

01:01.255 --> 01:03.690
My body's a well-oiled machine.

01:03.725 --> 01:06.160
I feel you, my dude.
We talkin' about practice.

01:06.195 --> 01:07.660
Not a game.
Practice.

01:07.695 --> 01:10.230
Come on, y'all, focus up.
Coach B gonna yell at us.

01:10.265 --> 01:13.230
- God damn, you scary, Grover.
- Yeah, homey.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.500
What in the hell
you think you're doing?

01:15.535 --> 01:17.470
Get your asses off the floor.

01:18.275 --> 01:19.970
You know better than that,
Grover.

01:20.005 --> 01:21.370
<i>Your brother Montrel
would be ashamed</i>

01:21.380 --> 01:22.910
<i>that you two dropped out
of the same cooch.</i>

01:22.945 --> 01:26.150
And, Jamal, you're only here
to boost the team's GPA.

01:26.185 --> 01:27.210
And you're failing at that.

01:27.220 --> 01:29.470
And white boy, you're
only here because your stepdad

01:29.471 --> 01:31.720
bought us the
jerseys, mother[bleep]er.

01:31.755 --> 01:35.890
Breath smell like he been
eatin' a dookie taco.

01:35.925 --> 01:38.790
<b>1x02 - "Child Please"</b>

01:44.470 --> 01:46.070
Yo, Randy, good practice, bro.

01:46.105 --> 01:50.570
Skerrt! Uh, did I give you
permission to talk to me, dog nuts?

01:50.605 --> 01:52.640
When I played with your bro,
if I talked out of turn,

01:52.675 --> 01:55.270
I'd get a thumb shoved up
my dookie shoot.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.380
Bet you talked out of turn
all the time.

01:58.345 --> 01:59.780
I'ma start calling you
"Mon-taint,"

01:59.815 --> 02:03.120
'cause you ain't Montrel
and you look like a taint.

02:04.155 --> 02:06.120
Punk-ass fresh fish.

02:06.155 --> 02:07.320
Damn right, Mumblemouth.

02:07.355 --> 02:09.259
Got 'eem.

02:10.195 --> 02:11.820
There you mother[bleep]ers are.

02:11.830 --> 02:14.890
I need to talk to you little niglets
about failing my health class.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.900
If you don't get
your shit together fast,

02:16.935 --> 02:18.360
you mother[bleep]ers will
be suspended

02:18.370 --> 02:20.470
from the mother[bleep]ing team, guys.

02:20.505 --> 02:21.570
What you mean, suspended?

02:21.605 --> 02:23.470
Basketball the only reason
we come to school.

02:23.505 --> 02:25.710
Yeah, come on, Coach Bundy.
Help some Black Lives Matter.

02:25.745 --> 02:29.340
Milk, you're white.
God helped you out, mother[bleep]er.

02:31.215 --> 02:32.810
If I can't
wear my jersey to school,

02:32.845 --> 02:34.780
I'ma go white boy
and shoot this bitch up.

02:34.815 --> 02:37.047
- Damn, Milk, you ain't got no chill.
- Yeah, you already know

02:37.048 --> 02:38.920
<i>- I ain't got no chill, homey.
- Ain't no need for violence.</i>

Next question.

02:53.705 --> 02:56.340
Hallelujah, bitch.
Nigga, I feel blessed.

02:59.505 --> 03:01.140
Grover, how could you...

03:01.175 --> 03:03.210
and not ask me?

03:05.515 --> 03:09.050
Yo, Grove, you gotta stop
thirsting for Randy's boo.

03:09.085 --> 03:10.220
You ain't even on her radar.

03:10.255 --> 03:12.120
Not yet.
But you know Cindy gonna be

03:12.155 --> 03:14.690
jockin' me once we legends.
Just watch.

03:19.830 --> 03:20.790
<i>- Oh!
- Ooh!</i>

03:20.800 --> 03:22.190
Hey, how do my nuts taste?

03:22.892 --> 03:25.130
<i>- Oh!
- He should've walked away.</i>

03:25.165 --> 03:27.517
Nice try, skeet scrub.
Now get to the back

03:27.518 --> 03:30.600
of the bus with the rest of 
the shit crew.

03:30.610 --> 03:31.840
Class, settle the [bleep] down.

03:31.875 --> 03:33.740
Now as a part of our
"Scared Celibate" curriculum,

03:33.775 --> 03:36.680
I will be partnering you up
to raise a goddamn baby.

03:36.715 --> 03:37.880
What you mean, raise a baby?

03:37.915 --> 03:40.550
Can't we just go to
Planned Parenthood?

03:40.585 --> 03:42.717
- I got a coupon!
- How am I supposed

03:42.718 --> 03:44.850
to go league if I got
daddy responsibilities?

03:46.755 --> 03:47.890
Oh, shut the [bleep] up!

03:47.925 --> 03:50.560
I present to you
the Totbot 3000.

03:51.495 --> 03:52.860
Now for the next week,
you gotta pretend

03:52.895 --> 03:55.730
this robot is
a mother[bleep]ing baby.

03:56.495 --> 03:58.860
Now it's time to
pair you bastards up.

03:58.870 --> 03:59.930
Milk, you with Shamal.

03:59.965 --> 04:01.700
Man, I gotta boos
with this wank-ass...

04:01.735 --> 04:04.700
Aight, I'ma be cool
'cause you my boy's sister,

04:04.710 --> 04:07.170
but I gotta tell it like it is.
I ain't doin' 'nathen.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.040
I'm keepin' it real,
like Grover's dad.

04:09.075 --> 04:11.510
That's fine,
as long as we're together.

04:11.545 --> 04:15.050
Jamal, I'm putting you
with Medina.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.720
Damn, Medina. Can a ledge
get some breathing room?

04:18.755 --> 04:19.649
You like a meat sweater.

04:19.685 --> 04:21.320
Don't get coy with me,
mother[bleep]er.

04:21.355 --> 04:24.660
We together, so you better get
used to me gettin' up inside you.

04:24.695 --> 04:26.430
Cindy, I think
it'd be good for you

04:26.465 --> 04:29.800
- to be paired up with... Grover.
- Oh, word?

04:31.570 --> 04:34.070
Come on, Coach. You know
Cindy and I belong together.

04:34.105 --> 04:36.070
- She's my lady.
- Nice try, mother[bleep]er,

04:36.105 --> 04:37.500
but we've got our first game
this week.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.870
We don't need you sticking
your energy in the wrong place.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.310
So your partner is LaDante.

04:41.345 --> 04:43.580
We progressive
like a mother[bleep]er.

04:45.150 --> 04:48.810
Brandy, you gonna be
my wife for life.

04:48.820 --> 04:50.320
On Oakland.

04:51.485 --> 04:52.850
<i>Nooo!</i>

04:52.885 --> 04:56.290
I was thinking we treat this
more like a side family.

04:56.325 --> 04:57.360
You take care of the baby,

04:57.395 --> 04:59.730
and I'll slide through
on nights and weekends.

04:59.765 --> 05:02.730
If you eat with your family,
I'll buy you lunch.

05:02.765 --> 05:04.600
Oh, okay.
One of these, one of those.

05:04.635 --> 05:06.630
Aight, but let's go grub
somewhere on the low low.

05:06.665 --> 05:09.240
We don't need all these squares
in our circle.

05:09.275 --> 05:11.000
I know a romantic spot.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.840
More tater tots, mother[bleep]er!

05:12.875 --> 05:15.410
I'm eating for two...
and the baby.

05:15.445 --> 05:18.380
You heard the lady.
Run the meatloaf, bitch.

05:20.345 --> 05:23.120
Look, Randy, I take
this parenting shit serious.

05:23.155 --> 05:25.920
This my tenth year doing
this project at Duncan.

05:25.955 --> 05:27.490
I expect you to be a good mommy

05:27.525 --> 05:30.360
and visit this little nigga
early and often.

05:30.395 --> 05:31.290
Y-you got it, LaDante.

05:31.325 --> 05:32.590
Whatever you need.

05:32.625 --> 05:36.200
And if you don't fulfill
your duties as my play wife,

05:36.235 --> 05:40.070
that ass is mine.
Feel me?

05:40.105 --> 05:43.370
I'll hold the baby.
You hold my belt loop, boo.

05:46.610 --> 05:48.470
Mmm.

05:51.015 --> 05:53.410
Come on, little LeBronya,
stop cockblocking on Daddy.

05:53.445 --> 05:54.510
Here, give her to me.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.750
It's obvious you have
no idea what you're doing.

05:56.785 --> 05:57.720
There, there, sweetie.

05:57.755 --> 05:59.320
Mommy has you.

05:59.355 --> 06:00.290
I guess you got the touch.

06:00.325 --> 06:02.520
You should try
touching these... nuts.

06:02.555 --> 06:04.690
Boy, please.
You know I'm with Randy.

06:04.725 --> 06:06.430
And I am not
looking to downgrade.

06:06.465 --> 06:09.200
You ain't downgrading.
You're investing early in a sure thing.

06:09.235 --> 06:11.330
And I'ma prove it to you,
if you let me take you out.

06:11.365 --> 06:12.700
Well, be a good baby daddy,

06:12.735 --> 06:14.970
help me ace this class,
and... we'll see.

06:15.005 --> 06:19.261
Girl, you about to get a A
and a meal at Golden Corral.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.140
<i>And now, your starting lineup...</i>

06:22.175 --> 06:24.600
Your boy, Montrel Cummings.

06:24.610 --> 06:27.770
[bleep] that.

06:29.715 --> 06:32.510
Well, look at you,
trying to be all grown and shit.

06:32.545 --> 06:34.720
Just trying to make sure
I pass this class

06:34.755 --> 06:37.950
- so I can stay on the squad.
- Yo, what you doing?

06:37.985 --> 06:43.460
Which one of you lazy negroes
ate my last Munchable?

06:44.630 --> 06:46.830
Oh, it's like that, huh?
Nobody got nothin' to say?

06:46.865 --> 06:49.103
I buy the groceries,
I paid for the couch,

06:49.138 --> 06:50.300
I even paid for the cable so
the white man can distract you

06:50.335 --> 06:52.470
from the real issues with
this mindless basketball game,

06:52.505 --> 06:54.430
and all I ask is
you don't eat my Munchables!

06:54.440 --> 06:56.040
Man, why you trippin', little bro?

06:56.075 --> 06:58.870
You don't like crackers, anyway.

06:58.905 --> 07:00.810
- Oh, we being funny?
- Man, just relax.

07:00.845 --> 07:03.180
Soon as I get
my NCAA reparations

07:03.215 --> 07:05.882
from the homey Ed O'Bannon's
lawsuit, I'll buy you

07:05.883 --> 07:09.218
Munchables, Brunchables,
and Dinnables.

07:09.253 --> 07:10.750
Fool, you play intramurals
at a junior college.

07:10.785 --> 07:12.950
The only check you getting
is a reality check,

07:12.960 --> 07:14.290
you broke-ass negro.

07:15.125 --> 07:16.590
I got buckets, though, nigga.

07:16.625 --> 07:17.790
Whatever.
I gotta go punch in.

07:17.825 --> 07:19.892
Apparently me and Mom
are the only people

07:19.893 --> 07:21.960
in this house putting in work.
Deuces.

07:21.995 --> 07:22.760
Stay black.

07:27.435 --> 07:28.700
Cheer practice just ended, Grover.

07:28.735 --> 07:30.770
I hope you don't mind me
showing up.

07:30.805 --> 07:33.240
Oh, okay. I ain't know
we was expecting company.

07:33.275 --> 07:35.580
I'll be right back.

07:37.250 --> 07:40.950
What's good, girl?
I'm Montrel, local hoops legend.

07:40.985 --> 07:41.920
Ha-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

07:41.955 --> 07:43.750
Come on, 'Trel.
This is my baby momma.

07:43.785 --> 07:45.490
Baby momma?
Man, the only thing

07:45.525 --> 07:48.320
getting pregnant around here
is your sock, Crunchy.

07:48.355 --> 07:50.920
Nasty. Anyway, how did
everything go with the baby?

07:50.930 --> 07:53.090
- Did she cry much?
- Yeah, but I fed her, burped her,

07:53.100 --> 07:54.800
changed her diaper,
and sang her some of that

07:54.835 --> 07:56.500
new Taylor Swift
until she stopped.

07:56.535 --> 07:59.170
You really hitting them high
notes like that, Grover?

07:59.205 --> 08:01.330
You already know, boo.
Anything for our baby.

08:01.340 --> 08:05.110
You're really taking this
serious, Grover. I like that.

08:05.145 --> 08:07.770
Mm.
Later, new booty.

08:08.615 --> 08:11.610
She want my pipe, guaranteed.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.480
Oh.

08:18.385 --> 08:19.550
There we go.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.690
Hey, Mom, you gotta take care
of this mark-ass baby

08:21.725 --> 08:23.360
if we finna pass this class.

08:23.395 --> 08:26.730
Of course, Milky.
Has Mommy ever let you down?

08:26.765 --> 08:29.160
Yeah, you have, when you
married that lame Uncle Joey.

08:29.195 --> 08:32.000
How many times have I told you?
My name is Dave.

08:32.034 --> 08:34.169
Well, you look like
that square from "Full House,"

08:34.205 --> 08:37.039
so you Uncle Joey to me, buster.
Now step out my kitchen.

08:37.075 --> 08:39.970
Milton, don't make me pull out
the mortgage paperwork

08:39.980 --> 08:41.640
to clarify who owns this house.

08:41.674 --> 08:44.480
See how white folk always be
referring to paperwork and shit?

08:44.515 --> 08:46.610
Come on, Milk,
we're in this together.

08:46.620 --> 08:48.850
I already been done
told you, Shamal.

08:48.885 --> 08:52.350
- That baby ain't mine.
- Milky, don't talk to her like that.

08:52.385 --> 08:55.520
Why don't I help you
with the baby, Shamal?

08:55.555 --> 08:57.990
Well, I guess so, if that's
the way Milk's gonna be.

08:58.025 --> 09:00.460
Cool, I'm about to go make
some stomach pancakes

09:00.495 --> 09:02.830
right quick.
See about me.

09:03.230 --> 09:05.630
I can't even come up
with no lies.

09:05.665 --> 09:07.870
- Jamal love the kids.
- You a great daddy, Jamal.

09:07.905 --> 09:10.040
And I'ma take care of
all your needs and things.

09:10.075 --> 09:11.570
That's cool, Medina.

09:11.605 --> 09:12.670
But you gotsta be gone.

09:12.705 --> 09:14.810
You ain't gonna invite me
inside to meet your parents?

09:14.845 --> 09:17.327
You trippin', boo. It
won't be as fun if we allow

09:17.328 --> 09:19.810
our relationship to venture
into the human dimension.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.250
We gotta keep our shit spiritual.

09:21.285 --> 09:23.880
You better not be trying
to play me with all that talk.

09:23.890 --> 09:26.458
- I know how niggas do.
- Go on now, boo.

09:26.493 --> 09:28.760
You finna find out
about me soon enough.

09:28.795 --> 09:30.590
Ya heard?

09:36.095 --> 09:38.630
I been holding that in all day.

09:43.010 --> 09:44.910
Ahh, look who woke up.

09:44.945 --> 09:47.140
You know, LaDante,
it's only one class, man.

09:47.175 --> 09:49.380
We... we don't have to
spend 24 hours together.

09:49.415 --> 09:52.550
Shut your ass up, wifey.

09:52.585 --> 09:54.410
I made eggs.

09:54.420 --> 09:57.650
You want patties, links,
or sausage?

09:57.685 --> 09:59.390
I-I should probably
just get home.

09:59.425 --> 10:01.490
Then it's links, nigga.

10:04.095 --> 10:05.930
All right, all right,
settle down.

10:05.965 --> 10:06.960
Now, when you have a baby,

10:06.995 --> 10:08.330
you need mother[bleep]ing
insurance.

10:08.365 --> 10:12.000
That's why you gotta enroll these
little bastards in Robamacare.

10:12.035 --> 10:14.430
Robamacare? Come on,
Coach, they're just robots.

10:14.440 --> 10:15.470
Did I [bleep]ing ask you?

10:15.505 --> 10:18.970
One of the utmost concerns
you'll have as a father, Randy,

10:19.005 --> 10:20.710
is deciding upon
the health care options

10:20.745 --> 10:24.180
that you'd like to provide
for your goddamn child!

10:24.215 --> 10:26.410
Watch your tone, Coach.
She with me now.

10:26.420 --> 10:27.950
Okay, okay, no disrespect.

10:27.985 --> 10:30.250
Now, apparently these
mother[bleep]ing robot babies

10:30.285 --> 10:32.820
can get sick like real
mother[bleep]ing babies.

10:32.855 --> 10:34.250
So I'll be
passing out these kits

10:34.260 --> 10:36.920
for y'all to do the vaccinations
your goddamn selves.

10:36.930 --> 10:38.930
I don't want to do
vaccinations, Milk.

10:38.965 --> 10:41.060
Jenny McCarthy says
they're linked to autism.

10:41.095 --> 10:44.360
Aye, Jenny McCarthy's
the smartest bitch in Hollywood.

10:44.370 --> 10:46.230
[bleep] Robamacare.

10:47.305 --> 10:48.130
We need to talk.

10:48.140 --> 10:50.040
I know.
I'm happy we doing this too.

10:50.075 --> 10:51.770
What we gonna do with the baby
tonight during the game?

10:51.805 --> 10:54.840
Can't you just let it chill
in the girls' locker room...

10:54.875 --> 10:56.740
- or your car?
- What?

10:56.750 --> 10:58.110
You're not leaving our child
in no locker.

10:58.145 --> 11:00.280
No, I was just playin', baby.
You know I'll take care of it.

11:00.315 --> 11:02.480
All right, Grover, I trust you.
You better not screw this up

11:02.515 --> 11:04.950
and mess up my streak of
straight A's.

11:10.730 --> 11:11.790
This should do the trick.

11:11.825 --> 11:14.630
- What's all that noise for?
- The baby's sick, Milk.

11:14.665 --> 11:16.630
Looks like measles
or something like that.

11:16.665 --> 11:19.070
Better stuff a sock in
that little mark's mouth.

11:19.105 --> 11:20.000
Yo, Mom, guess what?

11:20.035 --> 11:22.870
You watchin' Grover's baby
for the game tonight too.

11:22.905 --> 11:26.040
Oh, would love to.
Shamal and I can make it a party.

11:26.075 --> 11:28.410
That sounds like a great idea,
Mrs. Milk.

11:28.445 --> 11:31.380
We should have a party for
all the babies in class.

11:31.415 --> 11:34.510
What do we look like, Brangelina?
No more kids!

11:34.520 --> 11:35.820
Why you frontin', Uncle Joey?

11:35.855 --> 11:38.550
Always stepping on
the gators of some pimpin'.

11:38.585 --> 11:39.890
Look, man, I'm just sayin'.

11:39.925 --> 11:41.520
There were no black people
on "The Flintstones,"

11:41.555 --> 11:43.290
and there were definitely no
black people on "The Jetsons."

11:43.325 --> 11:45.790
We have no past
and we have no future.

11:45.825 --> 11:46.660
We do not exist.

11:46.695 --> 11:49.130
Turn the heat down and
let that simmer for a minute.

11:49.165 --> 11:51.530
Oh, it's simmering, my man.

11:52.735 --> 11:54.500
Um, excuse me.

11:54.535 --> 11:57.400
I was wondering.
Do you have "that"?

11:57.410 --> 12:01.710
Depends.
Do you have that cash?

12:03.410 --> 12:04.340
Another satisfied devil.

12:04.350 --> 12:06.210
Yo, Malik,
I need you to do me a favor

12:06.245 --> 12:08.580
and watch the baby for a few.
My first game is tonight.

12:08.615 --> 12:10.880
You kiddin', right? You know
I'm only eight years old.

12:10.890 --> 12:11.990
You should be watching me.

12:12.025 --> 12:14.390
Come on, little bro.
I ain't got no other options.

12:14.425 --> 12:15.390
Sounds like a YP, bro.

12:15.425 --> 12:17.520
I told you, you wasn't ready
to be a man like me.

12:17.530 --> 12:19.560
Now, if you don't mind,
I got a corner to manage.

12:19.595 --> 12:21.830
You bad for business.

12:21.865 --> 12:24.500
I hate robots.
A Roomba took my mom's job.

12:27.940 --> 12:29.940
Yo, 'Trel,
I got a favor to ask.

12:29.975 --> 12:32.040
I need you to watch my baby
while I'm at the game.

12:32.075 --> 12:34.710
Hmm, what does Uncle
'Trel get in return?

12:34.745 --> 12:36.680
- What you want?
- How about 50 bucks?

12:36.715 --> 12:38.380
50 bucks?
Montrel, you know

12:38.415 --> 12:39.910
I ain't got that
kind of dough on me.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.580
I'll give you anything else.
Just name it.

12:42.615 --> 12:43.780
Hmm.

12:43.790 --> 12:45.090
Let me get your social.

12:45.125 --> 12:47.020
- What?
- Sometimes Montrel has to

12:47.055 --> 12:49.420
become someone
other than Montrel.

12:50.595 --> 12:53.230
<i>Duncan, Duncan, we're the best.</i>

12:53.265 --> 12:55.460
<i>Let's go, Blackies, DHS.</i>

12:55.495 --> 12:57.760
Work that black D, baby!

13:00.705 --> 13:03.170
Our first
high school basketball game.

13:03.205 --> 13:04.540
We about to get our nuts.

13:04.575 --> 13:07.110
Yeah, I only missed, like,
three lay-ups in warm-ups,

13:07.145 --> 13:08.110
so I'm ready to go.

13:08.145 --> 13:09.780
How much y'all think
you finna drop tonight?

13:09.815 --> 13:10.910
Numbers don't mean nothing.

13:10.945 --> 13:13.210
I just need a couple of
highlights on Hoopsmixtape.

13:13.220 --> 13:14.950
I gotta have at least 16 points,

13:14.985 --> 13:17.520
since Montrel dropped 15
in his debut.

13:17.555 --> 13:19.890
Yeah, that dude was a legend.

13:22.225 --> 13:24.720
Nah, you too young to
puff on this dohja.

13:25.765 --> 13:28.190
I guess one hit won't hurt
the little niglet.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.060
Just don't tell yo dad.

13:32.565 --> 13:34.870
I don't know what it is,

13:34.905 --> 13:38.000
but something's tellin' me,
we ain't finna get no burn.

13:38.010 --> 13:39.910
Yo, as long as we don't get in,

13:39.945 --> 13:42.410
- our stats can't get messed up.
- Yeah, but let's be real.

13:42.445 --> 13:44.640
Everyone at school gonna think
we some benchwarmers.

13:44.650 --> 13:45.780
Hey, ref!

13:45.815 --> 13:48.362
You better start
calling some fouls for my wife,

13:48.397 --> 13:50.980
or I'ma see your ass 
in the parking lot.

13:50.990 --> 13:54.790
Damn, LaDante taking
this parenting shit serious.

13:54.825 --> 13:57.820
- Hey, where yo baby at, Grover?
- I left him with Montrel.

13:57.830 --> 13:59.790
- Say what, my nig?
- Aye, Grove, you do realize

13:59.800 --> 14:02.800
you off the team
if you kill yo baby, right?

14:07.805 --> 14:10.640
Shit, I'm out of rollin' paper.

14:21.420 --> 14:23.220
Hey, man,
how you turn this thing off?

14:23.255 --> 14:24.950
Maybe you just overheated.

14:28.360 --> 14:31.032
Man, I'm so [bleep]ed up.

14:32.114 --> 14:34.280
Oh, no, no.
Oh, man.

14:34.315 --> 14:36.480
Montrel, what did you do
to my baby?

14:36.490 --> 14:37.690
I don't know.

14:37.725 --> 14:40.250
I was just ripping fat
bong hits out of his ass,

14:40.260 --> 14:42.420
and then he started crying
like a little bitch.

14:42.430 --> 14:44.660
So I started shaking him
like I'm doing now.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.100
Gimme that.

14:50.030 --> 14:52.970
Oh, damn. Cindy thought I
looked sexy in my jersey.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.640
Wait a minute. She's
coming over to see LeBronya.

14:56.675 --> 14:58.610
I can't let her
see our baby like this.

14:58.645 --> 15:00.510
Montrel, you have to help me.

15:01.215 --> 15:03.340
I got a hook-up
that might help you out.

15:05.185 --> 15:07.180
Montrel, what's up, buddy boy?

15:07.215 --> 15:10.120
I got some technical nerd shit
for you, Brazy B.

15:10.155 --> 15:11.890
I wanted to see if
you could take a look at

15:11.925 --> 15:14.490
- my little bro's baby.
- No problem, buddy boy.

15:14.525 --> 15:16.720
- What's the matter with this guy?
- I don't know.

15:16.730 --> 15:19.660
It keeps shutting on and off
and acting all fidgety.

15:19.695 --> 15:21.300
Oh, yeah, buddy boy.

15:21.335 --> 15:23.100
This battery has liquid damage.

15:23.135 --> 15:26.600
Mm.
Tastes like Strawberry Brohito.

15:26.635 --> 15:27.740
Nah, don't look at me.

15:27.775 --> 15:30.500
You know I don't drink
that bitch-flavored bullshit.

15:30.510 --> 15:33.640
It looks like the baby has
Power Down Syndrome.

15:33.675 --> 15:35.510
My baby has
Power Down Syndrome?

15:35.545 --> 15:36.980
I'm off the team now for sho.

15:37.015 --> 15:39.580
Oh, no, no, no, no, don't worry.
I can fix, buddy boy.

15:39.615 --> 15:42.850
But, uh, it's gonna cost you
about 300... plus tax.

15:42.885 --> 15:46.190
$300?
But what about my Robamacare?

15:47.955 --> 15:49.090
I don't know what to do.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.630
If Coach sees this,
you know I'm off the squad.

15:51.665 --> 15:54.230
And if Cindy see it, I ain't
never gonna get my meat moist.

15:54.265 --> 15:56.930
At least your baby ain't
looking like no Benjamin Button.

15:56.965 --> 15:59.300
I don't know what
y'all complaining for.

15:59.335 --> 16:00.330
You did it to yourselves.

16:00.340 --> 16:01.840
Grover, you know
you wasn't supposed to

16:01.875 --> 16:04.100
leave your fate
in the hands of Montrel.

16:04.110 --> 16:07.440
And Milk, acting all uppity with
being an anti-vaxxer and all that.

16:07.475 --> 16:09.040
Oh, shit.
Here comes Cindy.

16:09.050 --> 16:12.110
What's up, Grover?
Where's my little munchkin?

16:12.145 --> 16:13.510
This is where we bounce.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.320
- Come here, LeBronya.
- Uh... here you go.

16:16.355 --> 16:19.450
Ew, why does my baby
look like Forest Whitaker?

16:19.460 --> 16:20.490
What are you talking about?

16:20.525 --> 16:22.960
Our baby's always
looked like Forest Whitaker.

16:22.995 --> 16:26.130
Okay, I ain't gonna lie to you.
I let Montrel watch the baby,

16:26.165 --> 16:28.860
and he may or may not have
spilled flavored beer on her,

16:28.895 --> 16:30.955
and may or may not have
used her as a bong.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.170
Grover, that's the dumbest
thing you could have done.

16:33.205 --> 16:34.270
What do you want me to do?

16:34.305 --> 16:36.200
You needed to cheer,
and I had a game to play.

16:36.210 --> 16:38.340
You mean,
you had a game to watch.

16:39.645 --> 16:42.480
If I fail this class, ooh,
I will never forgive you!

16:42.515 --> 16:45.810
Damn, homey, you ain't
never gonna smash now.

16:45.820 --> 16:48.050
- Believe dat.
- Stupid baby. It's your fault

16:48.085 --> 16:49.080
I ain't gonna get laid.

16:49.090 --> 16:51.320
Man, y'all some
professional passengers.

16:51.355 --> 16:53.220
Time for me to take the wheel.

17:18.185 --> 17:19.510
Man, that didn't do shit.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.119
My baby still rustier
than a mother[bleep]er.

17:22.155 --> 17:24.849
I failed you, my nigs.

17:32.595 --> 17:35.330
I don't now
what's wrong with my baby.

17:35.365 --> 17:37.530
- I think it's dying.
- Oh, Shamal.

17:37.565 --> 17:40.370
Every woman loses a baby or two
in her lifetime.

17:40.405 --> 17:42.540
I'm more upset that
Milk doesn't care.

17:42.575 --> 17:45.740
Shamal, let me hold that mark
right quick.

17:45.775 --> 17:47.310
Aye, yo, Mom,

17:47.345 --> 17:48.980
bring me some of them
hand sanitizers.

17:49.015 --> 17:51.110
This baby chaffin' all over me.

17:51.145 --> 17:53.350
- What up, my dudes?
- Not a damn thing.

17:53.385 --> 17:55.450
Got a Forest Whitaker baby,
lost my boo Cindy,

17:55.485 --> 17:57.920
and once I fail this class, I'm
gonna get kicked off the team.

17:57.955 --> 17:59.850
Man, ever since we had to be
responsible parents,

17:59.860 --> 18:02.060
our lives have been suckin'
some chicken dicks.

18:02.095 --> 18:03.660
Now I see why
dudes in the league

18:03.695 --> 18:04.930
don't hang out with they kids.

18:04.965 --> 18:07.560
Just get rid of him.
You already failing.

18:07.595 --> 18:09.800
Aye, he's right.
Can I kick it?

18:09.835 --> 18:11.070
Yes, you can.

18:11.105 --> 18:13.200
- Can I kick it?
- Yes, you can.

18:13.235 --> 18:16.000
Then I'm gone.

18:20.545 --> 18:22.380
Y'all would be
some goddamn kickers.

18:22.415 --> 18:24.810
I'm a quarterback, bitch.
Tebow.

18:24.845 --> 18:27.410
- Jamal! What the hell you doin'?
- Oh.

18:33.855 --> 18:35.990
<i>Touchdown!</i>

18:36.025 --> 18:37.690
No, no, no, no touchdown.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.560
She didn't complete the process.

18:39.595 --> 18:42.290
- Let's go to instant replay.
- Upon further review of the play...

18:42.291 --> 18:45.270
... stands.

18:45.305 --> 18:46.170
What him say?

18:46.205 --> 18:48.870
I said, upon
further review of the play...

18:48.905 --> 18:52.110
... stands.

18:57.350 --> 18:59.780
<i>We did it, yeah!</i>

18:59.815 --> 19:03.780
- Oh, no.
- What you mean, "Oh, no"?

19:08.155 --> 19:10.860
Mother[bleep]er, my baby.

19:10.895 --> 19:14.360
Damn, damn, damn!

19:23.780 --> 19:25.650
- I'm sorry, boo.
- Stop with the "boo" thing.

19:25.685 --> 19:27.080
You ruined my streak
of straight As.

19:27.115 --> 19:29.280
So if you think
we're gonna be boos,

19:29.290 --> 19:31.250
you're as high as your brother.

19:35.495 --> 19:37.460
Now I'm gonna have to
go to that school

19:37.495 --> 19:39.260
Lil' Romeo be rappin' about.

19:39.295 --> 19:43.230
- The hell happened to your Totbots?
- They all dead, Coach.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.430
I'm at peace with it.
Our baby led a good life.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.070
Wait a minute.
All your robots are dead?

19:47.105 --> 19:49.200
Shit, that means
I gotta teach summer school.

19:49.210 --> 19:51.170
I was supposed to be
going to Detroit.

19:51.205 --> 19:52.110
Think, mother[bleep]er.

19:52.145 --> 19:54.110
You know what?
I'm grading on a curve.

19:54.145 --> 19:55.380
All y'all get A's.

19:57.115 --> 19:59.910
Now get the [bleep]
out my classroom.

20:01.115 --> 20:03.220
Yo, Cindy,
can I holler right quick?

20:03.255 --> 20:04.350
What do you want, Grover?

20:04.385 --> 20:06.790
I just wanted to apologize
again for killing our baby.

20:06.825 --> 20:09.120
I promise it won't ever
happen again.

20:09.130 --> 20:10.590
Unless... you want it to.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.560
- What?
- Your body, your choice.

20:12.595 --> 20:15.030
The point is,
I'm not ready to be a daddy.

20:15.065 --> 20:18.800
But I am ready to be your man.
Trust and believe.

20:18.835 --> 20:23.440
You ain't a legend.
Yet.

20:26.915 --> 20:29.580
The games are way more
enjoyable with no kids.

20:29.615 --> 20:32.280
Yeah, that's why when
we start beating real cakes,

20:32.315 --> 20:33.180
we gotta strap up.

20:33.215 --> 20:36.320
Or just make sure our
pull-out game is strong, ya dig?

20:36.355 --> 20:37.450
Hold up.
Massa comin'.

20:37.485 --> 20:39.650
You mother[bleep]ers better stop
all this jaw-jacking

20:39.660 --> 20:42.820
and pay attention to
the goddamn game.

20:43.725 --> 20:46.260
I got a bad tooth,
mother[bleep]ers.
