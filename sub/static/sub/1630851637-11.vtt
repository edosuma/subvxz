<i>- Previously on
"Project Runway."</i>

00:13.913 --> 00:16.716
[all screaming]

00:16.783 --> 00:20.052
- You will design
the ultimate reunion show look

00:20.054 --> 00:22.088
for one of the Real Housewives.

00:22.154 --> 00:24.122
- I really would love to be

00:24.190 --> 00:28.227
like a sexy Disney princess.
- Oh.

00:28.294 --> 00:30.395
- Like it's a trousers
and the corset.

00:30.463 --> 00:31.797
- It's trousers?
- Yeah.

00:31.799 --> 00:32.898
- Did you want a pant?

00:32.965 --> 00:35.200
- No.
- No.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.768
- I don't think she looks happy.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.403
- She's not happy.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.873
- You all smoke?
Since when is smoking back?

00:40.940 --> 00:43.743
- Oh, God.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.878
<i>- Wow!
- Yes!</i>

00:45.945 --> 00:48.280
- Aaron and Shantall,

00:48.347 --> 00:50.415
you had our two favorite
looks of the night.

00:50.483 --> 00:54.419
- The winner is Shantall.
Congratulations.

00:54.487 --> 00:57.556
- Your dress was perfect
for a reunion show.

00:57.624 --> 01:00.292
- That's two in a row, Shantall.

01:00.359 --> 01:03.762
- Chasity, Christina, and Anna,

01:03.830 --> 01:07.099
one of you will
be going home tonight.

01:07.166 --> 01:10.669
- Anna, you are out.
I am so sorry.

01:16.309 --> 01:18.911

01:48.441 --> 01:50.742
- Congrats, Shantall.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.143
- Thank you.

01:52.145 --> 01:55.013
Right now it's hard
to just enjoy it.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.682
I mean, I don't sleep,

01:56.749 --> 02:00.219
thinking on getting
into the final three.

02:03.222 --> 02:04.356
- How you doing?

02:07.560 --> 02:11.163
- It was obvious your
collaboration did not go well.

02:11.230 --> 02:14.399
<i>And your scarf
was ill-conceived.</i>

02:14.401 --> 02:16.702
- I feel exhausted emotionally.

02:16.769 --> 02:20.473
<i>And I just need to find
the strength inside of me</i>

02:20.540 --> 02:23.842
and relieve emotions behind me,

02:23.910 --> 02:27.113
even it's hard to gain.

02:27.180 --> 02:30.516
But that's only I think
what I can do.

02:31.851 --> 02:33.786
- What? No!
- Oh!

02:33.853 --> 02:35.720
- What are you doing here?

02:35.788 --> 02:37.589
- Only three challenges

02:37.591 --> 02:39.858
between you
and New York Fashion Week.

02:39.860 --> 02:43.528
And one of those challenges
starts right now.

02:43.596 --> 02:45.164
- Starts--
- Oh, my God.

02:45.231 --> 02:46.731
- Follow me.
- I will go without my shoes.

02:46.799 --> 02:49.001
- Oh, my Lord.
- Go have a seat.

02:49.068 --> 02:50.470
- Hi, designers.

02:50.536 --> 02:51.603
All: Hi.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.271
- There's so few of you left.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.540
- Oh, my God.
- Are you tired?

02:55.608 --> 02:57.842
- Mm-hmm.
- A little bit.

02:57.910 --> 02:59.011
- Each of your models

02:59.078 --> 03:02.013
is rocking a fabulous hairstyle

03:02.081 --> 03:06.217
created by some very special
up-and-coming hairstylists.

03:06.219 --> 03:08.053
- Ooh, beautiful.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.855
- Come on out, ladies.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.191
- Whoo!

03:12.259 --> 03:14.393
- In an effort
to increase representation

03:14.460 --> 03:16.496
across the fashion
and beauty industries,

03:16.562 --> 03:20.098
TRESemmé has created
the Future Stylists Fund.

03:20.166 --> 03:22.701
It supports and elevates
up-and-coming

03:22.703 --> 03:24.836
Black hair stylists
through scholarships

03:24.904 --> 03:28.907
and access to incredible career
opportunities like this one.

03:28.975 --> 03:31.743
Are you ready to meet
the seven talented ladies

03:31.745 --> 03:34.280
behind these hair looks?
All: Yes.

03:34.346 --> 03:36.448
- Hi, ladies!
All: Hi.

03:36.515 --> 03:39.384
- We 'bout to be
real good for you.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.786
- Designers, each of you
is gonna be entering

03:41.854 --> 03:43.556
into a collaboration

03:43.623 --> 03:45.657
with one of these
up-and-coming stylists.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.426
You'll create a runway look

03:47.493 --> 03:50.295
inspired by the hairstyle
of your model.

03:50.297 --> 03:53.732
- Davanay and Agnes created
the twist hair look together.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.201
One of you will be lucky enough

03:55.268 --> 03:56.735
to get two stylists
to work with.

03:56.802 --> 03:59.004
- You'll need to stick
to the spirit

03:59.071 --> 04:00.672
of the foundational hairstyle.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.008
But you can get creative
with it, elevate it,

04:03.010 --> 04:04.476
do variations on it.

04:04.543 --> 04:07.079
As long as it works
with your collaborative vision.

04:07.146 --> 04:09.014
From head to toe,

04:09.016 --> 04:12.418
your look should showcase
both of your talents.

04:12.485 --> 04:14.753
- All right, guys.
Time to match you all up.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.522
Coral, we're gonna pick
a stylist out of this box.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.258
- You have Arkeeshia.

04:19.325 --> 04:22.160
- Beautiful pony.
- Okay, I love it.

04:22.228 --> 04:23.896
<i>I'm very excited
to work with her.</i>

04:23.963 --> 04:26.831
I already have in my mind
what I want to create.

04:26.899 --> 04:28.299
- All right.
Shantall, you ready?

04:28.301 --> 04:31.903
- You have Oluchi.
Yes, Bantu knots.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.171
- All right, Aaron, you're next.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.573
- Ariana.
- Lovely long braids.

04:35.641 --> 04:37.309
- Kristina.
- [laughs]

04:37.376 --> 04:40.479
- Aishat.
- Sleek and chic.

04:40.546 --> 04:43.515
- Bones, you have Kopper.

04:43.583 --> 04:46.184
- Creative buns.
- I'm so excited.

04:46.252 --> 04:47.886
<i>For hairstyles of color,</i>

04:47.953 --> 04:50.188
there's such a lack
of representation.

04:50.256 --> 04:52.992
<i>I know, myself, when I would
get to certain sets,</i>

04:53.059 --> 04:54.192
<i>hairstylists wouldn't know</i>

04:54.260 --> 04:56.094
<i>how to deal with textured hair.</i>

04:56.096 --> 04:58.429
- All right, Chasity.
So you know who you have.

04:58.498 --> 05:01.132
- Hey, y'all.
- Davanay and Agnes. Twists.

05:01.200 --> 05:04.870
<i>- For a long time,
Black women had to tame down</i>

05:04.937 --> 05:07.139
our voices when it
comes to our hair because

05:07.206 --> 05:09.141
hair is self-expression for us.

05:09.208 --> 05:12.378
<i>The fact that we get
to do it big on this platform</i>

05:12.444 --> 05:13.879
<i>and not be watered down,</i>

05:13.881 --> 05:16.681
I am really excited
about this challenge.

05:16.749 --> 05:19.017
- You'll have about 30 minutes
to sketch now,

05:19.085 --> 05:20.618
collaborate with your partner.

05:20.686 --> 05:22.554
Your stylist is gonna return
on Runway day

05:22.621 --> 05:24.222
and help create your final look.

05:24.290 --> 05:26.558
- Ladies, use your voices

05:26.625 --> 05:28.693
and have fun with it.

05:28.695 --> 05:31.130
- This is a one-day challenge.
- Oh, my God.

05:31.197 --> 05:34.232
- Oh.
- But you can do it.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.734
All right, designers,

05:35.801 --> 05:37.570
you guys can head to
the hair and makeup room.

05:37.636 --> 05:40.539
And your stylists and models
will be with you shortly.

05:40.606 --> 05:41.974
I'll see you later.

05:42.041 --> 05:43.175
- Bye, Patti.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.377
- Bye!
- Bye.

05:45.444 --> 05:47.046
- Do you think they're scared?
- Yeah.

05:47.113 --> 05:47.946
'Cause it's down to the wire.

05:48.013 --> 05:50.649
- Y'all ready?
- Where's your Patti?

05:50.717 --> 05:52.917
- Shake your Patti out, girl.

05:52.985 --> 05:54.419
- Hey, ladies.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.121
- Hi!
- Hey.

05:56.188 --> 05:57.589
- We're matching.

05:57.656 --> 05:58.990
- It--it's kismet, right?
- Yeah.

05:59.058 --> 06:00.792
- These pants are amazing.
- Thank you.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.060
- What made you want to do hair?

06:02.062 --> 06:03.528
What made you say, like,
"I want to do this"?

06:03.596 --> 06:04.863
- I decided last year

06:04.930 --> 06:06.532
I want to try something
I've always wanted to do

06:06.599 --> 06:08.733
and I took a stab at it.
And here I am.

06:08.801 --> 06:10.735
- On "Project Runway," girl.
- Okay.

06:10.803 --> 06:11.803
- About to do it up.
- Yes.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.472
So I'm thinking like a crown.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.206
She gives me queen vibes.

06:15.274 --> 06:19.078
So one here, two medium,
and small.

06:19.145 --> 06:21.747
And then hair here.
I want big and flowing.

06:21.814 --> 06:22.682
- Okay.

06:22.748 --> 06:24.515
<i>When it comes
to designing something,</i>

06:24.584 --> 06:26.651
I don't really think about,
"Oh, let me design

06:26.653 --> 06:27.953
these clothes
based around the hair."

06:27.955 --> 06:29.421
So that could be
a little bit tricky.

06:29.488 --> 06:30.822
I kinda want to hear
what you want, too.

06:30.824 --> 06:31.856
Like,
what's your favorite color?

06:31.858 --> 06:33.893
- Mm, my favorite color is red.

06:33.959 --> 06:36.962
- Red carpet make our wish.
- I'm glad you said that.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.231
So I guess we goin' red.

06:39.298 --> 06:41.233
- I love braids.
- Of course, okay.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.300
- Locs.
- Yeah.

06:42.368 --> 06:45.638
Very cultural, very Black.

06:45.704 --> 06:47.639
- Yeah.
[laughter]

06:47.707 --> 06:50.275
- Get real with that.
- Yes!

06:50.277 --> 06:52.044
- When I went to, like,
middle high school,

06:52.111 --> 06:53.778
I was like,
"Okay, Mom, I want a perm."

06:53.846 --> 06:56.915
I got a really bad scalp burn
all back here.

06:56.982 --> 06:59.652
And after that, it forced me
to learn how to do my own hair.

06:59.718 --> 07:02.488
- I have two daughters.
So I have not slept.

07:02.554 --> 07:04.722
Not no perm in their hair.

07:04.790 --> 07:07.426
So I tell them that their hair
is their crown.

07:07.493 --> 07:10.695
My daughters love
switching up their hairstyles.

07:10.697 --> 07:13.399
I teach them
the versatility of their hair.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.800
The fact that there are four
Black women

07:15.868 --> 07:18.437
with all natural hairstyles,
epic.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.272
I definitely want to do a gown.

07:20.339 --> 07:23.675
I definitely want to play off,
like, elevation and shapes.

07:23.743 --> 07:26.711
Depending on what they have
at the fabric store,

07:26.713 --> 07:28.579
something ethnic, of course.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.516
We taking sis
back to motherland.

07:30.582 --> 07:33.018
Both: Yes.
- Not in unison!

07:33.085 --> 07:34.686
[laughter]

07:34.753 --> 07:35.887
- Growing up in Nigeria,

07:35.889 --> 07:37.755
everybody's so expressive
with hair.

07:37.823 --> 07:40.058
We can sleek all of this
to one side.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.726
So you have kind of like a knot,

07:41.794 --> 07:43.428
a knot, a knot, a knot.

07:43.430 --> 07:46.297
- Like hip hop
comes into my head.

07:46.365 --> 07:47.632
Like this--
- Like '90s?

07:47.634 --> 07:50.735
- Like '90s.
Maybe using leather.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.370
- Oh, my gosh, leather.
Oh, my gosh.

07:52.438 --> 07:54.507
- Let's bring it.
- Let's bring it here.

07:54.573 --> 07:55.574
- Bring it here.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.009
[both vocalizing]

07:58.077 --> 07:59.778
- I was thinking like
finger waves

07:59.780 --> 08:01.313
with a little bit of edge to it.

08:01.380 --> 08:04.015
We want to, like, make it pop.
So I think the finger waves

08:04.083 --> 08:05.985
would really bring out
all of that.

08:08.454 --> 08:09.788
- Yes!
- Yes, yes.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.123
- I feel like we can
make it more modern.

08:12.191 --> 08:15.260
I don't want to, like, have too
much reference to the '20s.

08:15.327 --> 08:17.395
- Yeah. I'm so excited.

08:17.463 --> 08:19.964
- We call this
a balloon knot ponytail.

08:20.032 --> 08:23.968
So imagine maybe doing two.
The hair is gonna be big.

08:24.036 --> 08:27.138
And maybe instead of it
coming down, it going up.

08:27.140 --> 08:30.408
- I was thinking of the jacket
and the bottom.

08:30.410 --> 08:34.545
Not sure if it's better
a pant or skirt.

08:34.547 --> 08:35.680
- Why hair?

08:35.748 --> 08:36.948
- Basically, like,
in high school

08:37.016 --> 08:38.950
I had, like,
insecurities with hair.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.019
And I had my 10th grade
yearbook picture.

08:41.021 --> 08:44.289
It was raining all day
and my hair was like,

08:44.356 --> 08:45.724
half of it was straight

08:45.791 --> 08:48.293
and then the other half
was a big poof ball.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.028
And ever since then I was like,

08:50.096 --> 08:51.963
I vowed to learn
how to do my hair.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.831
I feel like it's just
my passion and purpose.

08:53.899 --> 08:56.201
- I feel the same way
about fashion.

08:56.203 --> 08:59.304
With something bad
always comes something good.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.072
<i>That's usually my motto in life.</i>

09:01.140 --> 09:04.208
<i>And I'm gonna do kind of
a play on a rain jacket.</i>

09:04.276 --> 09:06.178
It's a beautiful concept.

09:06.245 --> 09:07.513
I think we're gonna kick butt.

09:07.580 --> 09:09.247
- You get some rest,
then we gon' be ready

09:09.315 --> 09:11.316
to execute.
- Yes.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.117
- It was lovely meeting you.
- It was so nice meeting you.

09:13.185 --> 09:15.387
- I won't disappoint.
I promise.

09:15.454 --> 09:17.155
- Bye-bye.
- Be safe.

09:23.929 --> 09:26.831
- [singing "Happy Birthday"
in foreign language]

09:32.471 --> 09:34.205
- Merry Christmas, Grandma!

09:34.273 --> 09:35.740
<i>- Holy crap.</i>

09:35.808 --> 09:39.010
I am spending my 40th birthday
on "Project Runway."

09:39.078 --> 09:42.146
[all cheering]

09:42.214 --> 09:45.417
I'm celebrating it with new
friends and fellow designers

09:45.484 --> 09:47.419
<i>and living my best life.</i>

09:47.486 --> 09:51.422
And that's... amazing.

09:51.490 --> 09:53.659
I'm taking my doughnuts with me.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.265
- Hello.
- Hello.

09:59.331 --> 10:00.532
- All right, guys.
Since you're coming up

10:00.534 --> 10:01.599
with a client challenge,

10:01.601 --> 10:04.235
I want to remind you that
that is very different.

10:04.303 --> 10:06.906
This is a collaboration.
- Thank you.

10:06.972 --> 10:09.907
- 30 minutes to shop
and a budget of $500.

10:09.975 --> 10:11.709
- Okay.
- Yeah.

10:11.777 --> 10:14.112
All right, go. Bye.
- Okay.

10:14.180 --> 10:17.382
<i>- Oh, downstairs today.
Interesting.</i>

10:17.449 --> 10:18.617
- Too matte.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.686
- I need, like, white leather.

10:20.752 --> 10:23.588
- I'm looking for print.

10:23.656 --> 10:26.325
- I'm looking for
some nice reds.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.026
Come and get it.

10:28.093 --> 10:31.196
<i>I'm planning to make
a semi-avant-garde,</i>

10:31.263 --> 10:34.199
<i>very heavily draped,
Met Gala look</i>

10:34.201 --> 10:36.534
that is basically
my version of a sari.

10:36.602 --> 10:38.403
- [shouts]
- Oh, (BLEEP) my ass!

10:38.470 --> 10:40.505
- [chuckles]

10:40.573 --> 10:41.940
Why would she say that?

10:42.008 --> 10:43.274
- I can't breathe right now.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.343
- What are you gonna do
with leather

10:45.345 --> 10:46.645
in a one-day challenge?

10:46.713 --> 10:48.714
- I was thinking pants
and a jacket.

10:48.780 --> 10:50.548
- A what? In leather?
Everything?

10:50.616 --> 10:52.550
Really?
- Don't do this to me.

10:52.618 --> 10:54.152
- Why not?
- Oh, my God.

10:54.219 --> 10:56.655
- A white leather, like, outfit?

10:56.723 --> 10:58.389
- And do like a texture.

10:58.457 --> 11:00.693
I'm imagining a rapper girl.

11:00.759 --> 11:04.495
She's going maybe
to an MTV event

11:04.497 --> 11:05.898
or a Grammy event.

11:05.964 --> 11:07.031
- It's a one-day challenge.

11:07.099 --> 11:08.500
It's not the time to, like,

11:08.567 --> 11:11.169
try new things I don't think.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.905
- I can work with leather
in one-day challenge.

11:13.973 --> 11:16.441
What's the difference
with leather and fabric?

11:16.508 --> 11:17.075
It's the same thing.

11:19.712 --> 11:22.181
- Okay, I'm just saying.
- [groans]

11:22.247 --> 11:24.683
- Oh, my God,
I love these stripes.

11:24.751 --> 11:27.318
I'm thinking to create a gown

11:27.386 --> 11:29.922
<i>from black and white
striped fabric.</i>

11:29.988 --> 11:33.858
How much is this one?
Oh, you have just a little bit.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.927
That was not enough for my gown.

11:35.995 --> 11:38.863
<i>I just decided to take
this mix of greens</i>

11:38.931 --> 11:40.965
and I will see
what I'm gonna do with that.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.535
- You know, what you have
over here is getting crazy.

11:43.602 --> 11:45.570
- Yes, it is.

11:46.338 --> 11:49.073
- I really want to make, like,
a play on a raincoat

11:49.075 --> 11:50.909
because that's why
she went into business.

11:50.976 --> 11:52.210
- Well, that's cool.
Why can't you get, like,

11:52.278 --> 11:54.979
a cool raincoat fabric,
like plastic?

11:55.047 --> 11:56.715
If you're gonna do a coat,
do a coat.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.616
- I was gonna do a coat.
- Not a satin.

11:58.684 --> 11:59.884
- Okay.
- You know what I mean?

11:59.886 --> 12:00.719
- Then I'm going to go look
for plastic.

12:00.787 --> 12:01.986
- Go look for some vinyl.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.055
- I go upstairs
and I find vinyls.

12:04.123 --> 12:07.191
<i>It's crazy
and I'm excited about it.</i>

12:07.259 --> 12:07.826
I'm not gonna lie.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.828
<i>But I stepped out of my box</i>

12:09.895 --> 12:11.963
<i>and the perfectionist in me is--</i>

12:12.031 --> 12:14.500
Was screaming
really, really loud.

12:15.034 --> 12:17.235
How much is this a yard?

12:17.636 --> 12:19.738
- All right, designers,
ten minutes.

12:23.876 --> 12:25.643
- What a hoe.
- My turn.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.579
- Shantall,
I do really need ribbon.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.314
- I need my buttons too.
I'm sorry.

12:29.381 --> 12:31.983
- This is kind of, like,
a not necessary vibe.

12:32.051 --> 12:34.319
<i>Last night,
when we were in the lounge</i>

12:34.321 --> 12:36.988
<i>and she said that
she's here to win,</i>

12:37.055 --> 12:39.123
<i>it was the moment
I realized that</i>

12:39.191 --> 12:41.793
she's in the mood already
to fight.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.862
- Kristina, you have a minute.
- I have a one minute, please.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.397
<i>It's tension, you know.</i>

12:46.465 --> 12:49.333
<i>It's coming to all of us
and we feel it.</i>

12:49.401 --> 12:51.936
- All right, designers.
That's it. That's time.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.538
- Thank you, Mood.
- Thank you!

12:53.606 --> 12:54.139
<i>- Thank you, Mood.</i>

12:54.406 --> 12:59.945
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

13:00.078 --> 13:03.214
[all chattering]

13:03.282 --> 13:04.849
- We don't have to chase
for tables anymore.

13:04.851 --> 13:05.918
- No, we don't.

13:05.984 --> 13:09.420
- We are now
only three challenges

13:09.488 --> 13:11.756
<i>from the finale.</i>

13:11.758 --> 13:13.257
- Okay.

13:13.259 --> 13:17.028
<i>- I think it's very important
to show the judges</i>

13:17.096 --> 13:19.764
what you are able to do
in different ways.

13:19.832 --> 13:22.500
These are so perfect.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.901
<i>I want them to know that</i>

13:23.969 --> 13:26.371
I can do more than just dresses.

13:26.373 --> 13:27.506
That'll be fine.

13:27.573 --> 13:31.075
<i>I've been thinking of making
a jacket for a while now.</i>

13:31.077 --> 13:34.379
I'm a little bit nervous
because I want to use leather

13:34.381 --> 13:37.648
and the construction
is not that easy.

13:37.716 --> 13:38.950
Beautiful.

13:43.589 --> 13:44.990
- Mirror, mirror on the wall.

13:47.060 --> 13:50.428
Which dress for
my chocolate doll?

13:50.430 --> 13:52.263
<i>Black women have been
telling stories</i>

13:52.331 --> 13:53.932
<i>for centuries with our hair.</i>

13:53.999 --> 13:57.201
<i>My oldest daughter
sent me artwork.</i>

13:57.203 --> 13:59.604
<i>She has an arrow
pointing to my hair</i>

13:59.671 --> 14:01.807
with the word "crown" by it.

14:01.874 --> 14:06.277
I'm putting what my kids
envision into this look.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.347
How are y'all doing?
<i>- How are you?</i>

14:09.349 --> 14:12.417
<i>To create the crown situation...</i>

14:14.753 --> 14:16.621
- Something that can
hold structure, okay.

14:16.688 --> 14:20.024
Davanay and Agnes are going
to design this crown.

14:20.092 --> 14:22.761
<i>Elevate it,
make it more structured.</i>

14:22.828 --> 14:24.362
She's gonna be a maxi dress.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.163
<i>She's gonna have long sleeves.</i>

14:26.231 --> 14:28.299
<i>When she hits that runway,
y'all are gonna see</i>

14:28.367 --> 14:30.034
all the vibes,
you know what I'm saying?

14:30.102 --> 14:31.369
<i>- Yes.
- Yes!</i>

14:31.371 --> 14:33.971
- [groans]
This gonna take forever.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.173
<i>When I hear the phrase
"creative buns" for the hair,</i>

14:36.241 --> 14:37.976
I'm like,
"Girl, that's a messy bun."

14:37.978 --> 14:40.711
<i>You pin it in different ways.
You tuck it, you hairspray it.</i>

14:40.713 --> 14:44.048
<i>So that's basically the
aesthetic that I'm bringing.</i>

14:44.116 --> 14:46.485
<i>Just shaping, pulling, tucking.</i>

14:46.551 --> 14:50.554
<i>Underneath, I'm gonna put
a power mesh leotard</i>

14:50.622 --> 14:52.023
<i>and I may do a skirt,</i>

14:52.091 --> 14:54.358
depending on, like,
what my time is looking like.

14:54.426 --> 14:55.860
[whirring]

14:55.928 --> 14:57.995
Yeah.

14:58.063 --> 15:01.966
This is quite genius
if I say so myself.

15:04.736 --> 15:06.471
- Hello.

15:06.473 --> 15:10.207
I found this
beautiful white leather.

15:10.275 --> 15:12.477
<i>- Oh, my gosh,
that looks so dope.</i>

15:12.479 --> 15:15.279
<i>- I'm making these palazzo
high rise pants</i>

15:15.347 --> 15:17.415
<i>with cargo pockets in the front</i>

15:17.482 --> 15:18.984
<i>with this bomber jacket.</i>

15:19.050 --> 15:22.086
Since I'm making,
like, this shape

15:22.154 --> 15:25.156
with like, some buttons,
like, representing these.

15:25.223 --> 15:28.025
<i>- For the part? I can do that.</i>

15:28.093 --> 15:29.895
- Kisses.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

15:29.962 --> 15:31.495
I have to finish.
<i>- Okay.</i>

15:31.563 --> 15:34.098
- So I got this
really cool vinyl.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.766
<i>- Okay.</i>
- I am gonna do a trench coat

15:35.834 --> 15:37.435
<i>but it's all chevron pattern.</i>

15:37.437 --> 15:39.971
So it matches the braids
that you have.

15:39.973 --> 15:43.441
Like, you do the triangles.
And it's all very pointed.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.143
<i>So I think
the triangles work out</i>

15:45.210 --> 15:46.310
<i>really, really well with it.</i>

15:46.378 --> 15:50.047
<i>- Whatever materials you have,
I can braid with it in.</i>

15:50.115 --> 15:52.116
<i>I'm super excited.</i>
- Me too.

15:52.184 --> 15:53.886
<i>I've made a raincoat for theater</i>

15:53.952 --> 15:55.654
<i>but I have never done it</i>

15:55.721 --> 15:57.455
to wear in real life.

15:57.522 --> 15:59.658
<i>I've got nine hours
to figure it out.</i>

15:59.725 --> 16:03.361
<i>The last thing I want to do
is disappoint Ariana.</i>

16:04.796 --> 16:06.864
- Let me show you
what I've done.

16:06.866 --> 16:10.969
You know, it'll, like, do some
kind of wrappy, wrappy thing.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.471
<i>Abstract paintings
and pictures are definitely</i>

16:13.538 --> 16:15.740
<i>a part of how I like
to incorporate things</i>

16:15.807 --> 16:18.543
<i>into my clothing
and I haven't fully been able</i>

16:18.545 --> 16:21.011
<i>to show that
in the competition yet.</i>

16:21.013 --> 16:22.213
After I went home last night,

16:22.281 --> 16:23.682
I was kind of thinking
about, like,

16:23.749 --> 16:25.683
you were saying, like,
your son is your heart

16:25.751 --> 16:30.288
and, like, my dad had
a heart surgery last October.

16:30.290 --> 16:33.558
I have, like, this huge,
like, heart here.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.426
And I was, like, maybe
the theme of the Met Gala

16:35.494 --> 16:37.162
is, like,
the heart on my sleeve.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.129
So I'm thinking to make

16:39.198 --> 16:41.499
this shape
that kinda looks like a heart.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.101
I feel like it's a good
inspiration point

16:44.169 --> 16:46.437
to create not just
the conventional heart

16:46.505 --> 16:48.506
that we usually see,
which is this shape,

16:48.574 --> 16:50.908
but like what a heart
actually looks like.

16:50.976 --> 16:53.911
<i>My dad, definitely been
an inspiration for me.</i>

16:53.913 --> 16:56.781
<i>This is a nice moment for me
to just kinda, like,</i>

16:56.848 --> 16:57.983
pay tribute to that.

16:58.050 --> 16:59.517
Oh, sh--.

16:59.584 --> 17:02.387
She has a heart
on her arm as well.

17:02.454 --> 17:04.956
And I think it just, like,
brings it all together.

17:09.594 --> 17:11.262
Yeah, it'll--it's gonna
come together.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.436
- Hello.
- Hey, Christian.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.870
- Hi.
- Hi, Christian.

17:19.938 --> 17:21.873
- Prints. Plastic.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.275
Red. Cut-out boobs?

17:24.343 --> 17:25.876
- Yes.
- Yes.

17:25.944 --> 17:28.146
Hi.
- Oh, my gosh.

17:28.213 --> 17:31.015
- You went with
kind of an animal vibe.

17:31.082 --> 17:34.352
If you kind of go
with one print, I mean,

17:34.354 --> 17:37.755
it had better be the best dress
you can possibly make.

17:37.823 --> 17:41.125
Because then you have
a zebra maxi dress.

17:43.361 --> 17:44.963
- So I'm using horsehair

17:45.030 --> 17:46.631
and I'ma cover it
with the fabric.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.899
- Okay.
- Like, 3D how it pops up.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.501
- Yeah. So maybe do that next.

17:50.569 --> 17:51.969
- Okay.
- To see if it works.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.037
Because it doesn't work,
you've got--

17:53.104 --> 17:54.505
You need plan B and plan C.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.507
- No, it's gonna work.
I have to make it work.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.744
- Goodbye.
- Thank you, Christian.

17:59.611 --> 18:00.611
- All right, Aaron.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.446
How's it going?
- Awesome.

18:02.514 --> 18:04.148
- Oh, my God,
wasn't your birthday yesterday?

18:04.150 --> 18:05.316
- Yeah. It's today.

18:05.383 --> 18:06.450
- It's today?
- It's today.

18:06.518 --> 18:09.287
- I've got it. Here it is.

18:09.354 --> 18:12.057
Happy birthday. I got you this.
- Aw.

18:12.124 --> 18:14.225
Thank you. It's so sweet.
- Isn't it gorgeous?

18:14.293 --> 18:16.260
- I love a pearl necklace.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.862
<i>I love a good stolen handbag.</i>

18:17.929 --> 18:20.798
But I mean, he could've put
some money in it or something.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.601
- So your stylist
got into doing hair

18:23.668 --> 18:25.135
because of a rainy day.

18:25.137 --> 18:27.738
So it's this
sculptural rain coat.

18:27.806 --> 18:30.342
- Right, and everything is
gonna be kind of chevroned.

18:30.408 --> 18:31.609
- I'm glad you went
for something,

18:31.676 --> 18:34.312
like, bold and different.
- You know what--

18:34.314 --> 18:37.615
- But now, is it gonna go,
like, costumey?

18:37.682 --> 18:40.085
- Actually, when I showed
at New Orleans fashion week,

18:40.152 --> 18:42.287
I did a costume shop collection.

18:42.354 --> 18:44.889
<i>People loved it
because it was over the top</i>

18:44.891 --> 18:48.359

could still be wearable.</i>

18:48.426 --> 18:50.428
<i>That's what I would like
to do with this.</i>

18:50.430 --> 18:54.798
- There are ways to make
a dramatic coat.

18:54.866 --> 18:56.500
Think about, like,
the streetwear look, right,

18:56.568 --> 18:57.635
<i>that you did.
- Yeah.</i>

18:57.637 --> 18:59.838
<i>- It was so out of your world</i>

18:59.905 --> 19:01.405
<i>but it was so cool.</i>

19:01.407 --> 19:03.341
That, I think,
would surprise them.

19:03.408 --> 19:04.441
- You haven't steered me
wrong yet.

19:04.509 --> 19:06.478
- But don't blame me.

19:06.545 --> 19:07.745
- Okay, goodbye.

19:07.812 --> 19:10.347
- Kristina, you better put that
earring and that bag down.

19:10.415 --> 19:11.515
You don't even have a look.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.151
What are you doing over here?

19:13.153 --> 19:15.653
- So since, like,
she has a short hair,

19:15.720 --> 19:18.322
'20s, '30s finger waves.

19:18.390 --> 19:21.058
And I thought, like,
to make it modern,

19:21.060 --> 19:22.727
the base is gonna be pants.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.595
Like, here very tight.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.130
- It's looking
a little kind of, like,

19:26.198 --> 19:28.199
a kimono robe right now

19:28.201 --> 19:31.936
but you could do
a really cool top.

19:32.003 --> 19:35.139
Super fitted but short
or cropped and then a belt

19:35.206 --> 19:36.340
'cause you're gonna make a pant.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.942
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, could be fabulous.

19:38.009 --> 19:39.578

19:39.644 --> 19:42.646

fresh, fresh kind of design.</i>

19:42.714 --> 19:44.749
<i>But since we are collaborating,</i>

19:44.751 --> 19:46.751
<i>it has to match the hairstyle.</i>

19:46.753 --> 19:49.820
So it cannot be that crazy
and that risky.

19:49.888 --> 19:51.056

- Yes.

19:51.122 --> 19:52.657

19:52.724 --> 19:54.158

- Mm.

19:54.226 --> 19:56.428
- So it's ponytails.
- Yeah.

19:56.494 --> 19:58.629
- So this, it's like a bustier
but it's not.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.498
- A bustier jacket?
- Yes.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.500
- And then what's the rest?
A skirt?

20:01.566 --> 20:05.403
- A skirt. And I can make,
like, different shapes.

20:05.470 --> 20:08.372
- So what did you take
from this style?

20:08.374 --> 20:09.339
What kind of inspired the look?

20:09.408 --> 20:13.211
- That's, uh--

20:13.213 --> 20:14.445
I just was curious what happens?

20:14.513 --> 20:15.512
Like, what was it?

20:15.580 --> 20:16.914
What goes on?
- Yeah.

20:16.982 --> 20:18.582
- I think you're close

20:18.650 --> 20:20.051
to having something really cool.

20:20.118 --> 20:23.922
Figure out what the connection
is to the ponytail.

20:23.989 --> 20:27.257
Maybe there's something woven.

20:27.259 --> 20:28.993
I mean, even these,
like, are so cool.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.228
These little, like, rings.

20:30.295 --> 20:31.729

- Fabulous.

Oh, I just have to go with you?

20:39.972 --> 20:40.905
Mm-kay.

20:42.274 --> 20:44.275
I'm a great assistant.
- Thank you.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.410
- What are you gonna do?
- So DD was like,

20:46.412 --> 20:47.745
"I would love
a good red carpet moment"

20:47.812 --> 20:50.147
but making it still,
like, high fashion.

20:50.215 --> 20:51.749

20:59.325 --> 21:02.093

"the heart on my sleeve."

21:02.160 --> 21:04.295

21:04.362 --> 21:07.498
Oh, Lord.
There's other parties.

21:07.565 --> 21:09.900
So when it's open...
- Mm-hmm.

21:09.968 --> 21:12.036
- This is it?

21:12.103 --> 21:14.839
I mean, maybe it gets
a perfectly gorgeous collar

21:14.841 --> 21:18.176

and trying to get finished.

27:55.707 --> 27:57.307
- Pumpkin, what do you have
left to work on?

27:57.375 --> 27:58.109
- I have a lot.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.711
- Oh, my God.
You better work, girl.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.713
<i>- There is so much more
I need to do</i>

28:02.715 --> 28:05.115
<i>and now my top part is changing.</i>

28:05.183 --> 28:07.986
I was working on a corset
but I didn't like it.

28:08.052 --> 28:12.155
- Okay.
- It's gonna be bra and a belt.

28:12.223 --> 28:13.357
- Okay, girl.

28:13.359 --> 28:14.591
Make me two. Thank you.

28:14.659 --> 28:16.193
<i>- I want to make it really,</i>

28:16.260 --> 28:18.061
very, like a sexy,

28:18.129 --> 28:21.098
<i>but I'm just worried
that I'm running out of time.</i>

28:23.068 --> 28:24.569
- I feel like everybody
in the work room

28:24.635 --> 28:26.270
need a miracle right now.

28:26.337 --> 28:29.272
Let's bring your
celery juice machine here.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.274
- Celery juice already
not helping me.

28:31.342 --> 28:33.110
- [laughs]

28:38.716 --> 28:41.618
♪ I got a whole dress
to finish ♪

28:41.686 --> 28:43.853
♪ Doo dah, doo dah ♪

28:43.922 --> 28:46.723
- ♪ I got a whole look
to finish ♪

28:46.791 --> 28:49.426
♪ Doo dah, doo dah ♪

28:49.494 --> 28:52.896
- I can do this. I can do this.

28:52.964 --> 28:55.165
<i>It's almost end of the day.</i>

28:55.167 --> 28:57.734
<i>I'm worried
and I'm getting stressed</i>

28:57.802 --> 29:00.303
because there is so much
to do tomorrow.

29:00.371 --> 29:02.973
<i>I don't have time
to do any big changes.</i>

29:03.040 --> 29:05.709
This is the front for the front.

29:05.711 --> 29:07.511
<i>If you make a mistake,</i>

29:07.578 --> 29:11.749
it could be your last day here
so we need to be very careful.

29:13.484 --> 29:15.719
<i>- I know the jacket
is going to be good.</i>

29:15.786 --> 29:17.922
It's beautiful.

29:17.989 --> 29:21.325
<i>I cut out
the top of the jumpsuit</i>

29:21.327 --> 29:24.127
<i>and I start weaving
the colors in and out,</i>

29:24.195 --> 29:27.331
<i>trying to incorporate
this braided look</i>

29:27.333 --> 29:29.067
<i>into a jumpsuit,</i>

29:29.133 --> 29:31.368
hoping to God this will work.

29:32.703 --> 29:35.006
- 30 minutes, everybody.

29:35.072 --> 29:36.840
- Why you doing this to me?

29:46.150 --> 29:49.119
- Coral, my whole
pants finished.

29:50.756 --> 29:51.955
- What?

29:54.358 --> 29:55.292
- Oh, my gosh.

29:55.294 --> 29:58.229
You cannot fix leather
when it's ripped.

29:58.296 --> 30:00.964
- If this wouldn't be
a collaboration,

30:00.966 --> 30:03.701
of course I would
just create a new look.

30:03.768 --> 30:06.236
<i>A simple dress, very glam</i>

30:06.304 --> 30:08.038
<i>that has nothing
to do with the hair.</i>

30:08.105 --> 30:10.908
But I'm like, it wouldn't be
fair enough to Oluchi too.

30:12.911 --> 30:17.314
Well, Coral, you're going
to have a new roommate.

30:17.382 --> 30:18.982
- No, no, no.

30:18.984 --> 30:22.253
- I have no more fabric.
Now I have a jacket.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.822
The pants will be finished
for today.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.657
<i>I'm changing the back
of the pants.</i>

30:27.725 --> 30:30.261
<i>They were supposed to have
some columns of leather.</i>

30:30.328 --> 30:32.195
<i>Now it's going to be just twill.</i>

30:32.197 --> 30:34.831
And I'm using an extra zipper
in the back

30:34.899 --> 30:36.867
<i>that is not white
but it will work.</i>

30:36.869 --> 30:39.669
But the model cannot sit down.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.905
I need to scream.

30:43.474 --> 30:44.808
- Usually
for something like this

30:44.810 --> 30:46.476
I have a lot more time

30:46.478 --> 30:48.078
but we have one day.

30:48.145 --> 30:49.979
- All right, you guys,
that's time.

30:50.048 --> 30:55.552
We got a pinata at the house.
It's a party.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.421
Oh, we're home.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.624
- Gonna be a big goal
'cause sh-- ain't sh--.

30:59.690 --> 31:01.425
- We're opening the wine.

31:01.427 --> 31:02.492
- (BLEEP) my life.

31:02.560 --> 31:05.729
<i>- Every challenge,
I'm thinking, like, I'm tired.</i>

31:08.900 --> 31:11.168
- [high pitched]
Happy birthday to you.

31:11.170 --> 31:15.372
Happy birthday, Aaron.
Happy birthday to you.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.508
[laughter]

31:18.510 --> 31:20.710
- That was amazing,
by the way, Shantall.

31:20.778 --> 31:22.779
Girl, let's go beat the sh--
Out of this pinata.

31:22.847 --> 31:24.514
- Yeah, please.
- I got the bat.

31:24.516 --> 31:26.249
<i>- Everybody's, like,
very stressed out.</i>

31:26.251 --> 31:27.250
I feel bad for the pinata.

31:27.318 --> 31:28.719
One.
- There you go.

31:28.786 --> 31:30.854
- Two.

31:30.922 --> 31:31.855
Three.

31:31.922 --> 31:34.925
- Get it!
[all screaming]

31:36.595 --> 31:39.062
Can I do some? Hey, hey, can I?

31:42.333 --> 31:43.834
<i>I'm thinking,
all the time we got</i>

31:43.902 --> 31:45.469
<i>to stress to finish the dress</i>

31:45.536 --> 31:47.338
and I thought
I was never gonna finish.

31:53.377 --> 31:55.145
- Oh, my God,
the bat is finished.

31:55.212 --> 31:57.480
- I told you all,
silent but deadly.

31:57.548 --> 32:00.550
- What is inside?

32:00.618 --> 32:02.753
All: Happy birthday, Aaron!

32:02.820 --> 32:05.423
[chatter]

32:05.489 --> 32:07.891
<i>- Why don't we go to bed?
We got runway tomorrow.</i>

32:13.631 --> 32:15.566
[bowl chimes]

32:18.636 --> 32:22.372
- We are going to be five.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.841
- Okay, I don't want
to think about that.

32:23.908 --> 32:25.909
I just want to think about

32:25.911 --> 32:28.178
getting it done for today.

32:28.245 --> 32:31.048
- Hi, Sten, how are you?

32:31.115 --> 32:34.217
- Great.
<i>- You're great?</i>

32:34.585 --> 32:37.688
<i>My kids are definitely
my motivation for anything.</i>

32:37.755 --> 32:39.656
Kyrsten, how's school going?

32:39.658 --> 32:40.925
<i>- It's going great.</i>

32:40.992 --> 32:43.126
- I went on a really big
emotional journey

32:43.194 --> 32:44.861
during in 2020.

32:44.863 --> 32:48.465
<i>I found myself with all these,
like, depressing feelings.</i>

32:48.467 --> 32:51.935
It came to the point
where I had, um,

32:51.937 --> 32:56.105
suicidal thoughts and...

32:56.174 --> 32:58.608
I just reached, like,
a real mental low.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.610
Mommy looks at y'all's
drawings every day

33:00.678 --> 33:03.347
<i>and it reminds me
to keep going for y'all.</i>

33:03.414 --> 33:06.616
<i>The reason why
I haven't crumbled is because</i>

33:06.684 --> 33:10.821
<i>I see my daughters
and I just feel like,</i>

33:10.888 --> 33:11.989
don't--don't give up.

33:12.057 --> 33:15.592
I have so much
for you in the future.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.160
<i>And here I am today.</i>

33:17.228 --> 33:19.696
<i>- Love you.</i>
- Love you so much. Bye.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.732
<i>- Come on, everybody.
Let's go.</i>

33:21.799 --> 33:23.934
<i>We have a big day today.</i>

33:24.970 --> 33:27.605
- Oh, my Lord.

33:27.671 --> 33:29.040
Have so much to do.

33:29.106 --> 33:32.142
- So much. So much.

33:32.144 --> 33:34.045
- We just have two hours
before the runway

33:34.111 --> 33:36.881
and I need to finish my top.

33:36.947 --> 33:38.147
Crossed fingers.

33:38.216 --> 33:41.184
Thank God
I had, like, this backup fabric

33:41.186 --> 33:44.989
so she could have, like,
a whole cropped top inside.

33:47.391 --> 33:52.229
- Overnight, I couldn't stop
thinking about this jumpsuit.

33:52.296 --> 33:55.900
<i>It's a hot ---ing mess.
It is not who I am.</i>

33:55.966 --> 33:57.902
Between now and the runway,

33:57.968 --> 34:01.071
I need to make something
I'm proud of.

34:01.073 --> 34:04.108
<i>I have two yards
of spacer fabric.</i>

34:04.174 --> 34:06.643
I am going to make new pants.

34:07.878 --> 34:09.613
- Good morning, everybody.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.614
All: Good morning.

34:11.682 --> 34:13.616
- I have a lot to do.

34:13.684 --> 34:16.886
<i>When it was a first fitting,
Daryana didn't bring a bra</i>

34:16.954 --> 34:21.191
<i>but I'm taking a bra
that I made it yesterday</i>

34:21.193 --> 34:24.261
<i>and use it to make a fitted top.</i>

34:24.328 --> 34:26.095
- How's the rest of the look?

34:26.097 --> 34:27.897
- Like, so sexy, Christian.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.301
- And an amazing top?
- Yeah, super sexy top.

34:30.367 --> 34:32.936
- Super sexy top.
This little--little tiny top?

34:33.004 --> 34:34.505
- Yes!

34:34.572 --> 34:37.174
- That's a little tiny top.
Okay.

34:37.241 --> 34:38.675
Ready for a model?
- No.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.977
All: Yes.

34:41.045 --> 34:43.646
- Let's go. One-day challenge.

34:43.714 --> 34:45.448
- Hey, baby.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.650
[chatter]

34:47.718 --> 34:49.120
- Good morning.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.590
- And you are gonna have
yellow pants.

34:53.658 --> 34:55.992
I changed my mind
about halfway through.

34:56.060 --> 34:59.396
20 minutes out of my day,
I have spent making new pants.

35:00.265 --> 35:01.999
<i>Please work.</i>

35:02.066 --> 35:04.001
Uh.

35:04.068 --> 35:06.103
I just wasted 20 minutes.

35:06.171 --> 35:07.203
Yeah, we're gonna change these.

35:07.271 --> 35:08.671
So go ahead and take those off.

35:08.739 --> 35:09.773
I can manage this.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.942
I am going back to my blue
pants that are finished.

35:13.010 --> 35:17.747
- I want to see
how sexy you are.

35:17.815 --> 35:19.549
- Right?

35:19.617 --> 35:21.718
- It was a happy mistake for
forgetting my bra yesterday.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.153
- Right?

35:23.220 --> 35:24.354
- You have pockets too.

35:24.422 --> 35:25.889
So at the end of the runway,
work it.

35:25.956 --> 35:28.125
I might still put something
cool on your shoulders

35:28.192 --> 35:29.559
to balance that out.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.428
- All right, designers.
When you're ready,

35:31.430 --> 35:33.430
take your models
to the TRESemmé hair salon

35:33.432 --> 35:35.098
and the Maybelline
makeup studio.

35:35.166 --> 35:37.167
- Hey, guys.
- You're here!

35:37.235 --> 35:38.369
- Yes.
- Yeah.

35:38.435 --> 35:40.737
- I'm so happy and grateful
to meet you.

35:42.774 --> 35:45.042
- How are you?
- Hi!

35:47.278 --> 35:48.912
- So the finger waves
are still there.

35:48.979 --> 35:50.513
And with all the stripes,

35:50.515 --> 35:51.581
I think it's gonna be
really cool.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.617
- Amazing.
- A little bit of volume

35:53.684 --> 35:54.952
just at the top.

35:55.019 --> 35:56.519
So we use TRESemmé gel

35:56.587 --> 35:59.589
to kind of make it look
a little wet as well, you know?

35:59.657 --> 36:01.224
We got you, girl.
- Thank you so much.

36:01.292 --> 36:03.259
- Do we still want to do
one big--

36:03.261 --> 36:04.595
- Big bun? Yeah.
- Okay.

36:04.662 --> 36:06.529
- Like French braids
through the top.

36:06.597 --> 36:08.665
- Perfect.
- I'm so excited to meet you.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.233
- I'm so excited
to work with you.

36:10.301 --> 36:12.001
I feel like I'm already
learning so much.

36:12.069 --> 36:14.238
- I wish, like, when I was
coming up in the industry,

36:14.304 --> 36:16.272
like, I had a woman of color

36:16.340 --> 36:18.307
to really help guide me
through the industry.

36:18.376 --> 36:19.476
I'm proud to be here.

36:19.478 --> 36:20.843
This is the TRESemmé gel.
- Okay.

36:20.911 --> 36:21.912
- I love this extra hold gel

36:21.979 --> 36:23.481
because it's still moisturizing

36:23.547 --> 36:25.515
but doesn't feel
too dry in her hair.

36:25.583 --> 36:27.850
It'll still give
a little bit of sheen.

36:27.918 --> 36:29.285
It's not gonna be matte.

36:29.287 --> 36:31.554
Here, girl. Let me assist you.

36:31.622 --> 36:34.024
Let me assist you
for a little while.

36:37.128 --> 36:38.094
- Check on my good sis
over here.

36:38.162 --> 36:39.396
- Bigger, bigger, bigger,

36:39.398 --> 36:40.397
bigger, bigger, bigger,
bigger, bigger.

36:40.464 --> 36:42.432
- Bigger? Okay.
You go on there. We got you.

36:42.499 --> 36:45.635
- I love what's happening here.

36:45.703 --> 36:47.470
- This is some of the fabric
that he brought us.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.639
We just want to tie
that in to the look.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.108
- I love it.

36:52.342 --> 36:54.844
- You guys are so talented.
- Oh, thank you.

36:54.912 --> 36:56.846
- And it is important
to have representation.

36:56.848 --> 36:59.349
- You just don't see it enough
and you hear a lot of times

36:59.416 --> 37:01.651
that some models
don't get, you know,

37:01.653 --> 37:03.787
to feel as beautiful because
the stylist didn't know

37:03.789 --> 37:05.855
how to do their texture,
their hair.

37:05.923 --> 37:07.857
- Yeah, so true.
- So it's nice to be able to be

37:07.925 --> 37:09.426
someone that knows
how to work with the texture

37:09.428 --> 37:10.761
and still make you beautiful.
- Amen to that.

37:10.828 --> 37:12.429
- Thank you, thank you.
- Amazing.

37:14.466 --> 37:16.799
- I'm missing a button
somewhere.

37:17.335 --> 37:19.469
- Don't look at the back.
- Why not?

37:19.537 --> 37:20.470
- 'Cause it's bad.

37:20.538 --> 37:22.739
- Oh, my God. What happened?

37:22.741 --> 37:24.474
- Um, me.

37:24.541 --> 37:26.676
- Um...
- It's gonna be a cover-up job.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.011
- Okay.

37:28.512 --> 37:30.880
- I made a strapless,

37:30.948 --> 37:34.751
<i>poorly constructed
neoprene spacer,</i>

37:34.818 --> 37:37.687
hot disaster.

37:37.689 --> 37:39.689
I'm gonna take it in at the top

37:39.757 --> 37:41.591
and fix some seams.
- Right now?

- Hi.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.907
- Hi!

37:57.975 --> 38:00.409
- The shapes with the spirals,
the structure.

38:00.478 --> 38:01.978
- I love what you have here.
- Yes.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.846
We're gonna add some
baby hairs, some swirls.

38:03.914 --> 38:05.582
- The TRESemmé gel
is gonna help us do that.

38:05.584 --> 38:08.319
- Do it up.
I will see y'all later.

38:09.887 --> 38:12.689
- I'm your assistant today.
Tell me what you need.

38:13.490 --> 38:15.826
- I want to use the Flawless
Curls Combing Cream.

38:15.828 --> 38:17.560
As we wrap it around
in the Bantu knot,

38:17.562 --> 38:19.496
we just want the ends
to be really clean

38:19.563 --> 38:21.231
and not have a lot of flyways.

38:21.233 --> 38:22.999

- What are you guys doing?

38:25.002 --> 38:26.470
- We're doing Bantu knots.

38:26.537 --> 38:28.305
- Are they gonna be everywhere?
- They're gonna be, like,

38:28.373 --> 38:29.673
kind of, like, on each side.
- Oh, cool.

38:29.740 --> 38:31.808

came up with the look.

38:31.876 --> 38:33.409

38:33.477 --> 38:35.279

extra hold mousse

38:35.346 --> 38:38.281
just kind of helps
everything hold in place.

38:38.349 --> 38:40.751

- Oh, wow.

38:40.818 --> 38:42.318
I thought it was
gonna be only one.

38:42.386 --> 38:44.054
- I told you
we're gonna go more.

38:44.121 --> 38:45.755
You don't want the shape?
You don't like the shape?

38:45.757 --> 38:48.825

it's so clean.

38:48.827 --> 38:49.693

38:49.760 --> 38:52.695
I don't think it's gonna go

38:52.763 --> 38:56.233
Maybe it's a little bit much.
- 'Cause we can take some out.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.402

39:06.977 --> 39:07.978

39:08.045 --> 39:10.379
And then if it doesn't work,
we can work with it.

39:10.381 --> 39:12.249

39:21.392 --> 39:23.393
Should you push 'em up
or something?

39:23.460 --> 39:26.430

what is wrong

39:26.496 --> 39:28.331

a collaboration challenge

39:28.399 --> 39:30.433

in the look.

39:30.501 --> 39:33.002
AH, I don't know. I'm nervous.

39:33.070 --> 39:36.806
I can go and sew
but I don't think I have time.

39:36.874 --> 39:38.608
- We gotta be out of this room
10 minutes

39:38.675 --> 39:40.610

39:47.619 --> 39:49.419

39:49.421 --> 39:50.519
- I can sew it.

39:50.588 --> 39:51.889

39:51.955 --> 39:54.056
- Oh, Christian.

39:54.592 --> 39:56.092

40:01.833 --> 40:02.899
Let's go.

40:02.966 --> 40:05.501

when you push, this can grow.

40:05.569 --> 40:07.504
So if we need to sit down,

40:07.506 --> 40:09.839

it has one sleeve.

The cuff, like the shirt has.

48:15.058 --> 48:17.460
that is very girls-conscious,

48:17.527 --> 48:20.529
I probably would have
just tacked it a little more

48:20.597 --> 48:23.031
to give a little bit
more support rather.

48:23.100 --> 48:26.670
- We wanted to keep like a bra
but it was visible.

48:26.736 --> 48:29.072
So we decided
not to use the bra.

48:29.139 --> 48:32.408
- But literally just lifting it
and retacking it

48:32.476 --> 48:33.743
would have made
a huge difference.

48:33.810 --> 48:35.744
But she looks amazing.

48:35.812 --> 48:36.945
- All right, thank you,
Kristina.

48:36.947 --> 48:38.213
Daryana,
you can leave the runway.

48:38.281 --> 48:40.549
- Thank you.
- All right, Coral.

48:40.617 --> 48:41.751
Let's get your model out here.

48:45.488 --> 48:48.290
Coral, why don't you tell us
about your look.

48:48.358 --> 48:51.560
- I like always to do
kind of a feminine silhouette

48:51.562 --> 48:54.530
using, like,
a hard material, like, leather.

48:54.598 --> 48:57.166
- Is the jacket
leather or pleather?

48:57.233 --> 48:58.702
- Leather.
- Okay.

48:58.768 --> 48:59.935
And it's your signature detail

49:00.003 --> 49:01.270
on the side?
- Yes.

49:01.272 --> 49:03.773
I added a little bit
of macrame on the side.

49:03.840 --> 49:05.442
So it creates
a little bit of drama

49:05.508 --> 49:07.176
<i>while she's walking
in the runway.</i>

49:07.178 --> 49:09.445
- It looks impressive

49:09.512 --> 49:11.580
for the amount of time
that you had.

49:11.582 --> 49:14.983
That shows me that you have
a steady hand and focus.

49:14.985 --> 49:16.985
- Thank you.
- The clothes themselves

49:16.987 --> 49:18.387
are absolutely beautiful.

49:18.389 --> 49:20.624
And the hair
is absolutely beautiful.

49:20.690 --> 49:22.324
- Yeah.
- I felt that the hair

49:22.392 --> 49:24.727
and the look
were two separate things.

49:24.794 --> 49:26.462
- Okay. It looks beautiful.

49:26.530 --> 49:29.598
But yeah, I understand
it looks kind of separated.

49:29.666 --> 49:32.735
- I have to say
I'm not a fan of the cups.

49:32.802 --> 49:35.003
It might have been
a little bit too ambitious.

49:35.005 --> 49:37.239
And I do think
the fit of the skirt

49:37.241 --> 49:40.275
is a little bit straight,
which isn't as flattering.

49:40.343 --> 49:42.746
- I wanted her room to walk.

49:42.812 --> 49:46.349
And I didn't want to do a slit
since I have this lace.

49:46.416 --> 49:47.817
It would have been
a little bit more open.

49:47.884 --> 49:48.985
- Yeah.

49:49.053 --> 49:52.421
- What I think is really helpful

49:52.489 --> 49:54.824
about this challenge

49:54.891 --> 49:58.227
is to understand the importance

49:58.295 --> 50:02.965
that hair and makeup
has on your design.

50:02.967 --> 50:04.767
That's what went wrong here.

50:04.834 --> 50:08.170
However, this is a very
sharp looking jacket.

50:08.172 --> 50:09.638
That's all I have to say.

50:09.706 --> 50:10.640
- Thank you.

50:10.707 --> 50:11.841
- I love the craftsmanship.

50:11.908 --> 50:15.144
Like, it is really
amazing detailing

50:15.146 --> 50:17.446
but I love
the pieces separately.

50:17.514 --> 50:19.182
And also separate from the hair.

50:19.249 --> 50:20.784
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Coral.

50:20.850 --> 50:22.185
Cassandra,
you can leave the runway.

50:23.187 --> 50:24.521
All right, Bones,
you're up next.

50:24.587 --> 50:26.856
Let's bring out your model.

50:29.460 --> 50:32.795
Tell us about your look
and your hair and makeup

50:32.862 --> 50:34.397
and what inspired
the whole thing.

50:34.464 --> 50:37.933
- Um, my dad had
a major heart surgery

50:38.001 --> 50:40.336
and is still, like,
in a bit of recovery.

50:40.338 --> 50:42.538
And so I just started
thinking of, like, the heart

50:42.606 --> 50:43.806
and, like,
honest to God opinion, like,

50:43.873 --> 50:46.942
I just wanted to make, like,
a seven foot long, like, sari.

50:47.010 --> 50:48.210
And so she'll be able
to take this off

50:48.212 --> 50:51.079
and have this outfit underneath
for a little more freedom.

50:51.081 --> 50:53.216
- Can we see it
without the coat?

50:55.952 --> 50:58.187
- And this skirt can move
to different lengths.

50:58.189 --> 51:00.823
- Can you show us that?
- Yeah.

51:00.890 --> 51:03.025
- Oh. I like this length.

51:03.093 --> 51:05.694
This, to me, is a work of art.

51:05.696 --> 51:07.263
And that's the kind of work

51:07.330 --> 51:09.265
<i>that personally,
I feel drawn to.</i>

51:09.332 --> 51:10.966
- Thank you so much.

51:10.968 --> 51:12.635
- Bones, I think you had an idea

51:12.702 --> 51:14.570
but I don't think
it's a finished idea.

51:14.638 --> 51:18.041
I think it's easy to say
it's conceptual and weird

51:18.108 --> 51:19.642
and it's okay. It's not.

51:19.709 --> 51:23.345
This felt like
you were trying so hard...

51:23.347 --> 51:24.714
but couldn't deliver.

51:24.781 --> 51:27.916
- I was trying so hard
to finish. [chuckles]

51:27.984 --> 51:28.984
But no excuses.

51:29.052 --> 51:30.252
I completely accept
that critique.

51:30.254 --> 51:35.258
- I would have collaborated
a little bit more on the bun.

51:35.325 --> 51:37.860
But I felt like you
understood the assignment.

51:37.862 --> 51:41.097
I love the top part
in the fabric that you used.

51:41.165 --> 51:43.632
I think you're already
on your way to the Met

51:43.700 --> 51:44.434
with the reveal

51:44.501 --> 51:47.402
'cause I personally love
a Met reveal.

51:47.470 --> 51:49.472
I love it.
- Thanks, Precious.

51:49.539 --> 51:51.874
- Where I was challenged today
with this

51:51.876 --> 51:53.276
was clarity of idea

51:53.343 --> 51:55.143
because I didn't know
which thing to focus on,

51:55.145 --> 51:56.745
<i>the coat or the sari,</i>

51:56.813 --> 51:58.847
<i>or what's happening on the bust.</i>

51:58.849 --> 52:00.683
I would've just personally
loved to have seen

52:00.685 --> 52:03.385
the big coat myself.
Thank you, Bones.

52:03.387 --> 52:04.554
DD, you can leave the runway.

52:05.689 --> 52:08.457
Aaron, we'll talk to you next.
- Okay.

52:11.295 --> 52:12.962
- Okay, Aaron,
tell us about your look.

52:13.029 --> 52:14.631
- So when I met Ariana,

52:14.697 --> 52:17.432
she told me this story
about a rainy day

52:17.500 --> 52:20.435
and a yearbook picture
that still haunts her.

52:20.503 --> 52:22.638
I got eight yards of vinyl

52:22.640 --> 52:25.975
and turned it
into this raincoat trench.

52:26.042 --> 52:28.310
And the hair was braided
to the side

52:28.312 --> 52:30.712
like many of my local clientele.

52:30.780 --> 52:32.715
And we threw some color in
because you know what,

52:32.717 --> 52:35.318
maybe it's raining,
maybe she's going to the club.

52:35.385 --> 52:38.121
- But we gotta talk about
what's underneath it.

52:38.188 --> 52:41.458
Okay?
Because what's underneath,

52:41.524 --> 52:44.661
with all due love and respect,
is tragic.

52:48.198 --> 52:56.004
- Aaron, can we see it
without the jacket?

52:56.072 --> 52:58.140
- Yeah.

52:58.474 --> 53:00.276
- So what happened
at the back here?

53:00.343 --> 53:02.010
- That's my poor
time management.

53:02.078 --> 53:03.445
- It just looks like

53:03.447 --> 53:05.814
the president of
the doing too damn much club.

53:05.882 --> 53:08.684
- I think I pushed myself
too hard on one thing

53:08.752 --> 53:10.085
and forgot about the fact

53:10.087 --> 53:11.954
that she can't walk down
the runway naked.

53:11.956 --> 53:13.022
- Or she could have.

53:13.089 --> 53:14.489
And it would have been
better than that.

53:14.557 --> 53:16.825
Like, you could have
sent her down in undergarments

53:16.893 --> 53:19.561
and it would have sold
that jacket more than

53:19.563 --> 53:20.362
what's underneath it right now.

53:20.430 --> 53:23.465
- I own it. It is what it is.
- It is.

53:23.467 --> 53:25.368
- And I got
a really great jacket

53:25.435 --> 53:28.904
and an undergarment
that--it's under.

53:28.906 --> 53:33.075
- All that said, your talent
is on display with that jacket.

53:33.142 --> 53:35.211
I loved it
from behind the screen.

53:35.279 --> 53:36.712
<i>She came around.</i>

53:36.714 --> 53:39.649
<i>I was instantly
drawn to the color,</i>

53:39.716 --> 53:42.718
the texture, the fit.

53:42.786 --> 53:46.221
I literally would put that on
and walk out of here right now.

53:46.223 --> 53:48.724
- Aaron, I was confused
when I saw her.

53:48.792 --> 53:52.060
<i>Was she a gymnast?
Was she a superhero?</i>

53:52.128 --> 53:54.197
<i>But you have incredible talent</i>

53:54.264 --> 53:55.665
and I can see it on that coat.

53:55.732 --> 53:58.267
And more than that,
I have seen it in

53:58.334 --> 54:01.269
many, many instances
down this runway.

54:01.271 --> 54:03.006
Don't be so hard on yourself.
- Thank you.

54:03.072 --> 54:06.008
- I personally
am really into a trench.

54:06.075 --> 54:08.544
I feel like that's something
that would sell out instantly.

54:08.546 --> 54:10.145
That would not stay
on anyone's rack

54:10.213 --> 54:11.480
and I think
it's really beautiful.

54:11.547 --> 54:13.449
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Aaron.

54:13.516 --> 54:15.952
Yuan, you can leave the runway.

54:16.019 --> 54:18.188
Okay, Chasity, you're up.
- Okay.

54:18.254 --> 54:20.422
- Let's bring your model
out here.

54:21.224 --> 54:22.592
All right, Chasity,
tell us about your look.

54:22.659 --> 54:24.760
Talk to us
about the inspiration.

54:24.828 --> 54:27.229
- The hairstylists
really, like, fueled my fire.

54:27.296 --> 54:28.631
One thing I'm inspired
by is, like,

54:28.698 --> 54:31.267
Black women's hair
literally defies gravity

54:31.335 --> 54:32.835
'cause our hair grows up.

54:32.837 --> 54:35.271
So I definitely wanted
to play with that as well

54:35.339 --> 54:36.606
but complement that look

54:36.673 --> 54:38.507
and not clash with it
or take away from it.

54:38.575 --> 54:41.109
- You committed to a look
and you went there.

54:41.778 --> 54:45.347
And it just felt
like a runway moment.

54:45.415 --> 54:47.483
<i>I could see in the bust,</i>

54:47.550 --> 54:49.719
<i>it had a signature detail
of you.</i>

54:49.786 --> 54:51.286
I love that.

54:51.354 --> 54:53.489
- Chasity,
I have to tell you that

54:53.556 --> 54:56.658
it is the most impressive outfit

54:56.726 --> 55:00.863
that I have seen from you
to date.

55:01.599 --> 55:04.666
- I did my makeup today.
Don't make me cry, please.

55:04.734 --> 55:08.737
- You embraced this challenge
wholeheartedly.

55:08.739 --> 55:13.942
<i>She is giving me absolutely
Black girl magic mean.</i>

55:14.010 --> 55:16.478
<i>The hair is extravagant.</i>

55:16.480 --> 55:18.281
It is really stunning.

55:18.348 --> 55:20.615
- Thank you.
- I'm so impressed.

55:20.683 --> 55:23.752
It flows and like,
when you make a big decision,

55:23.820 --> 55:25.954
you make the decision
and you flow with it.

55:26.022 --> 55:28.657
Every part of this look
shows that you did that.

55:28.725 --> 55:31.293
- I appreciate it.
- I will say that

55:31.360 --> 55:33.295
I was not a fan of this print.
- Okay.

55:33.297 --> 55:35.597
- With hair this dramatic,

55:35.599 --> 55:38.433
I felt like your design was
competing with the hair.

55:38.501 --> 55:39.835
I just would have chosen

55:39.902 --> 55:43.305
a print
that wasn't as overpowering.

55:43.372 --> 55:44.707
So you were in
the middle for me.

55:44.774 --> 55:46.641
- Okay.
- Chasity, thank you.

55:46.709 --> 55:47.810
Jessica,
you can leave the runway.

55:49.846 --> 55:51.479
Okay, Shantall,

55:51.548 --> 55:54.450
let's get your model out here.

55:54.517 --> 55:57.052
Shantall, tell us about
your look, the hair,

55:57.054 --> 55:58.387
how it all came together.

55:58.389 --> 56:01.623
- Her hairstyle is Bantu knots.

56:01.625 --> 56:04.593
So we started thinking about
Alicia Keys

56:04.661 --> 56:07.162
going maybe to Music Awards.

56:07.230 --> 56:09.365
And I decided to use leather.

56:09.432 --> 56:11.867
- Are the pants leather?
- The front are leather.

56:11.934 --> 56:13.201
The back is twill.

56:13.269 --> 56:14.903
- The jacket is leather as well?

56:14.971 --> 56:16.271
- The front is leather.

56:16.339 --> 56:19.341
The sleeves with
the texture is leather.

56:19.408 --> 56:21.343
And the back is twill.

56:22.378 --> 56:24.679
- Oh, there you go.

56:24.747 --> 56:27.283
Would you mind
taking the jacket off?

56:27.350 --> 56:29.851
I did love
what you did with the knit.

56:29.853 --> 56:31.186
The pants look terrific.

56:31.254 --> 56:34.623
I wasn't a huge fan
of the jacket.

56:34.691 --> 56:37.593
Despite all that, the vision
in terms of the hair

56:37.660 --> 56:39.162
and the design are there.

56:39.228 --> 56:40.962
- [quietly] Oh, thank you.

56:41.030 --> 56:44.633
- The Bantu knots, I love.
I have Bantu knots today.

56:44.701 --> 56:47.636
<i>It's giving me TLC.
It's giving me '90s.</i>

56:47.703 --> 56:50.340
And I just love
how it looks elevated as well.

56:50.406 --> 56:52.307
I just think that
the outfit is stronger

56:52.375 --> 56:54.676
without the jacket.
- Thank you, Precious.

56:54.678 --> 56:57.379
- I'll say I think
this is a successful marriage

56:57.381 --> 56:59.781
of hair and outfit.

56:59.783 --> 57:02.117
I knew immediately
who this girl is,

57:02.185 --> 57:03.319
<i>where she's going.</i>

57:03.386 --> 57:05.787
It was cohesive head to toe.
- Thank you.

57:05.789 --> 57:08.658
- Is what's on the belly,
the glitter,

57:08.724 --> 57:10.259
was that an intentional choice?

57:10.326 --> 57:11.994
- It's because
the glitter of the fabric.

57:12.061 --> 57:14.130
It wasn't intentional.
- I just kept thinking, like,

57:14.197 --> 57:15.864
I'm definitely going home
after this

57:15.932 --> 57:19.467
and dumping glitter
all over my belly.

57:19.469 --> 57:20.435
Thank you, Shantall.

57:20.503 --> 57:21.870
Roberta,
you can leave the runway.

57:21.938 --> 57:23.338
- Thank you.

57:24.140 --> 57:26.341
- Okay, designers,
We have a lot to talk about.

57:26.409 --> 57:28.276
And we talk about
splitting hairs a lot.

57:28.344 --> 57:29.645
No pun intended.

57:29.712 --> 57:31.347
I think it's gonna come down
to that today.

57:31.414 --> 57:33.349
So we're gonna talk it out.

57:33.416 --> 57:34.583
We're gonna ask you
to leave the runway

57:34.650 --> 57:36.284
and we'll see you soon.
All: Thank you.

57:36.352 --> 57:37.553
- Thank you.

57:45.494 --> 57:47.429
- It's getting hard as hell.

57:49.899 --> 57:51.967
- Okay, y'all, I think
there were two designers

57:52.034 --> 57:53.768
who sort of middled out,

57:53.836 --> 57:55.671
which was Bones and Shantall.

57:55.738 --> 57:58.174
So can we just say
that they're both safe?

57:58.241 --> 57:59.274
- Yes.

57:59.342 --> 58:00.776
<i>It's safe to say they're safe.</i>

58:00.778 --> 58:03.311
- Let's move on
to our favorites.

58:03.313 --> 58:05.513
Let's talk about Chasity.

58:05.515 --> 58:07.615
When I came into
the runway tonight,

58:07.684 --> 58:08.583
I wanted a runway look.

58:08.651 --> 58:12.187
And I think Chasity
delivered a runway look.

58:12.255 --> 58:17.125
- From head to toe,
it was a sole focus vision.

58:17.193 --> 58:18.460
- Like, as Black women,

58:18.528 --> 58:20.529
so many times
it's about the hair.

58:20.531 --> 58:21.564
- Yeah.
- And everything follows.

58:21.630 --> 58:23.765
And I think that
it just felt like

58:23.767 --> 58:25.134
she was really connected
to this look.

58:25.201 --> 58:28.070
- I love how she described
Black women's hair

58:28.137 --> 58:29.471
as defying gravity.

58:29.538 --> 58:30.739
<i>- Mm.</i>

58:30.807 --> 58:34.209
- And I love
how the design of the hair

58:34.211 --> 58:37.412
<i>even inspired the structure
of those pockets.</i>

58:37.414 --> 58:39.414
- Those are pockets?
- Yes, girl.

58:39.416 --> 58:43.485
- This is her best look so far
in this entire competition.

58:43.552 --> 58:46.355
- While I wasn't a big fan
of that print,

58:46.422 --> 58:49.158
what we saw today
was Black girl magic...

58:49.225 --> 58:51.893
- It was magical.
- From Chasity, it really was.

58:51.895 --> 58:54.563
- Can we talk about Kristina?

58:54.565 --> 58:56.565
<i>- Head to toe, it was cohesive.</i>

58:56.632 --> 58:59.001
This is how women want to dress.

58:59.068 --> 59:00.936
- Right.
- I love the fact that Kristina

59:01.003 --> 59:04.506
put her in this kind
of masculine feminine look.

59:04.508 --> 59:06.441
<i>It was really refreshing</i>

59:06.509 --> 59:08.510
<i>to see her
with the finger waves.</i>

59:08.512 --> 59:11.046
- It speaks so much
to Black hair

59:11.114 --> 59:12.515
and, like, having finger waves

59:12.582 --> 59:14.850
and that crop look
and the baby hair.

59:14.852 --> 59:16.451
It really hit home for me.

59:16.519 --> 59:18.720
- And I love to see
a pantsuit on the runway.

59:18.722 --> 59:20.589
- Love a pantsuit.

59:20.591 --> 59:21.523
- I mean, I agree.

59:21.590 --> 59:22.658
I think she did a great job.

59:22.725 --> 59:24.393
Was the color my favorite?

59:24.460 --> 59:25.927
<i>Not particularly.</i>

59:25.929 --> 59:29.064
But you always know
it's Kristina.

59:29.132 --> 59:31.866
So I think we're all clear
on who the winner is.

59:31.934 --> 59:33.601
Okay, but can we talk about

59:33.603 --> 59:35.537
our least favorites
of the night?

59:35.604 --> 59:37.640
- Aaron.
- Big mistakes.

59:37.706 --> 59:39.941
- When it rains, it pours.
You know what I mean?

59:39.943 --> 59:42.011
And tonight, it poured on Aaron.

59:42.078 --> 59:44.346
- That coat was ambitious,

59:44.414 --> 59:45.547
<i>was well done,</i>

59:45.549 --> 59:47.048
<i>and the hair worked.</i>

59:47.116 --> 59:48.684
<i>That's where he needed to stop.</i>

59:48.751 --> 59:51.787
- The trench was,
I thought, quite cool.

59:51.854 --> 59:54.756
But what lies beneath

59:54.758 --> 59:56.358
<i>was anything but.</i>

59:56.425 --> 59:59.094
<i>- The jumpsuit wasn't finished.</i>

59:59.162 --> 1:00:00.895
I realized
I didn't even mention the hair

1:00:00.963 --> 1:00:02.831
because I couldn't get past
the jumpsuit.

1:00:02.899 --> 1:00:05.233
- Same.
- It was...

1:00:05.301 --> 1:00:07.435
an epically bad day for Aaron.

1:00:07.503 --> 1:00:08.837
And Coral.

1:00:08.905 --> 1:00:10.905
- I really wanted
to love that look.

1:00:10.973 --> 1:00:14.242
<i>I could tell exactly
what she was kinda going for</i>

1:00:14.310 --> 1:00:17.679
but the messiness of the hair
and the million shapes

1:00:17.681 --> 1:00:19.314
and then the embossed
and the leather

1:00:19.316 --> 1:00:20.917
<i>and then the fringe.</i>

1:00:20.983 --> 1:00:24.919
It just felt like she kinda
got a little confused.

1:00:24.921 --> 1:00:27.556
<i>- The hair didn't go
with the look.</i>

1:00:27.624 --> 1:00:30.259
<i>The top didn't go
with the bottom.</i>

1:00:30.325 --> 1:00:32.061
It just felt like a mess.

1:00:32.128 --> 1:00:35.631
- It was chaotic.
And really, for the challenge,

1:00:35.699 --> 1:00:38.533
she did not either understand
the challenge.

1:00:38.601 --> 1:00:40.135
I mean, she certainly
didn't meet it.

1:00:40.137 --> 1:00:43.872
And--and that is where
I'm at with Coral tonight.

1:00:44.608 --> 1:00:48.076
Do we all agree
on who's going home?

1:00:48.144 --> 1:00:50.012
Okay.
Let's get them back out here.

1:00:54.250 --> 1:01:02.250
- Kristina and Chasity,

1:01:02.692 --> 1:01:05.026
you two had our favorite looks
of the night

1:01:05.094 --> 1:01:07.795
and one of you
will be our winner.

1:01:07.864 --> 1:01:10.165
Both of your designs
met the challenge

1:01:10.232 --> 1:01:12.635
<i>and perfectly
complemented the hair.</i>

1:01:15.172 --> 1:01:18.773
Chasity...

1:01:18.841 --> 1:01:22.177
you are the winner.

1:01:22.179 --> 1:01:24.846
- Thank you.

1:01:24.848 --> 1:01:27.248
- I just am so proud to see

1:01:27.316 --> 1:01:29.250
how much you thought about

1:01:29.318 --> 1:01:32.053
how important it is
for Black women

1:01:32.055 --> 1:01:34.055
to express ourselves
through hair.

1:01:34.057 --> 1:01:36.858
You did a beautiful job.
- Thank you so much.

1:01:36.860 --> 1:01:38.860
My oldest daughter
for the longest

1:01:38.862 --> 1:01:40.328
really didn't accept

1:01:40.330 --> 1:01:44.599
her dark skin, um,
or her natural hair.

1:01:44.667 --> 1:01:48.336
So today I really wanted
to create someone

1:01:48.338 --> 1:01:50.872
that she can relate to.

1:01:50.874 --> 1:01:53.741
And for her to be proud of me
as her mom.

1:01:53.743 --> 1:01:56.277
I dedicate this look
to my girls.

1:01:56.345 --> 1:01:58.346
[applause]

1:01:58.414 --> 1:02:01.416
- Well, congratulations
on your win, Chasity.

1:02:01.418 --> 1:02:02.884
- Thank you.

1:02:02.886 --> 1:02:06.988
- Kristina, you are also in,
you Russian assassin.

1:02:07.056 --> 1:02:08.691
- [chuckles]

1:02:08.758 --> 1:02:11.494
- Shantall, Bones,

1:02:11.560 --> 1:02:13.728
you are also both in.

1:02:13.730 --> 1:02:15.730
All four of you
may leave the runway.

1:02:15.798 --> 1:02:16.965
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1:02:17.033 --> 1:02:19.735
- I love y'all. Thank you.

1:02:20.804 --> 1:02:22.637
- Oh, my word.

1:02:22.639 --> 1:02:25.040
[screaming]

1:02:25.042 --> 1:02:26.442
- Aw.

1:02:26.509 --> 1:02:28.443
- This is the third win.

1:02:28.511 --> 1:02:30.779
Oh, my God.
- Superstar!

1:02:30.846 --> 1:02:32.714
<i>- But I have to keep
showing the judges</i>

1:02:32.782 --> 1:02:35.050
that I really deserve
to go to Fashion Week.

1:02:35.052 --> 1:02:36.918
Top five.
Congratulations, y'all.

1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:39.121
- Congratulations.
You deserve that.

1:02:39.188 --> 1:02:41.389
- Aaron and Coral,

1:02:41.457 --> 1:02:43.725
one of you will be out tonight.

1:02:44.728 --> 1:02:47.895
Coral, your look
was disconnected

1:02:47.964 --> 1:02:49.897
<i>and failed to meet the challenge</i>

1:02:49.966 --> 1:02:52.468
of corresponding
with the hairstyle.

1:02:52.535 --> 1:02:55.737
Aaron, your jacket had potential

1:02:55.804 --> 1:02:57.339
but the styling

1:02:57.341 --> 1:03:01.342
<i>and the poor construction
of that jumpsuit</i>

1:03:01.410 --> 1:03:04.179
<i>was a tragic misstep.</i>

1:03:10.619 --> 1:03:12.620
Aaron...

1:03:12.688 --> 1:03:14.390
you are out.

1:03:14.456 --> 1:03:15.923
- Thank you.

1:03:15.992 --> 1:03:17.925
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

1:03:17.994 --> 1:03:19.795
- Oh, my God.
- Go be you, honey.

1:03:24.700 --> 1:03:27.101
- Coral, you are in.

1:03:27.169 --> 1:03:28.837
And you may leave the runway.

1:03:28.904 --> 1:03:32.040
- Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.

1:03:42.318 --> 1:03:45.253
- I am a kid from a small town
in West Virginia.

1:03:45.255 --> 1:03:46.789
And here I am.

1:03:46.791 --> 1:03:48.723
I'm grateful.

1:03:48.725 --> 1:03:51.459
And I will never forget it.

1:03:51.461 --> 1:03:53.661
I spent my birthday
on "Project Runway."

1:03:53.663 --> 1:03:55.731
Come on now.
- Yes.

1:03:55.733 --> 1:03:58.667
- It's incredible.
- Aaron, just being here,

1:03:58.669 --> 1:04:01.135
you are a winner.

1:04:01.137 --> 1:04:02.938
- Thank you.
- You're talented

1:04:02.940 --> 1:04:05.873
but you have a great heart
and a great attitude,

1:04:05.875 --> 1:04:07.975
and that is gonna
carry you even farther.

1:04:07.977 --> 1:04:09.877
- We will miss you.
- Thank you all.

1:04:09.879 --> 1:04:12.814
- We love you. Bye, Aaron.
We'll miss you.

1:04:12.816 --> 1:04:15.149
- I'll miss you. I promise.

1:04:15.151 --> 1:04:19.088
<i>I became an adult at 40
on "Project Runway."</i>

1:04:19.090 --> 1:04:24.559
Owning my mess.
That I am proud of.

1:04:24.561 --> 1:04:26.494
Guys, I'm not sad.

1:04:26.496 --> 1:04:27.896
<i>You spend
your whole life worrying</i>

1:04:27.898 --> 1:04:29.564
<i>if you're good enough.</i>

1:04:29.566 --> 1:04:33.768
<i>And everybody has bad days.</i>

1:04:33.770 --> 1:04:35.036
<i>But tomorrow,</i>

1:04:35.038 --> 1:04:37.639
I'm gonna look up
and know I'm good enough.

1:04:37.641 --> 1:04:39.742
You're batsh-- crazy.
- I know.

1:04:39.744 --> 1:04:41.709
So are you.
That's why we click.

1:04:41.711 --> 1:04:43.011
- I know.
- Hello.

1:04:43.013 --> 1:04:44.580
- Hi.
- Hi, Christian.

1:04:44.582 --> 1:04:48.317
- You grew and learned so much
from day one to now.

1:04:48.319 --> 1:04:49.484
- This has been awesome.

1:04:49.486 --> 1:04:51.052
- You have to feel so proud
of yourself, right?

1:04:51.054 --> 1:04:53.187
- Oh, top six,
"Project Runway" Season 19.

1:04:53.189 --> 1:04:55.857
- Pretty fabulous, guys.
- Yeah. I'm excited.

1:04:55.859 --> 1:04:57.191
- All right.
Well, clean up your stuff.

1:04:57.193 --> 1:04:58.192
Good luck.

1:04:58.194 --> 1:05:01.029
- I didn't come here
to write a narrative.

1:05:01.031 --> 1:05:02.864
I came here to be me.

1:05:02.866 --> 1:05:05.467
<i>And you know what? I was.</i>

1:05:05.469 --> 1:05:08.103
Exactly and uniquely me.

1:05:11.274 --> 1:05:13.608
<i>- Wathe "Project Runway"
after show right now</i>

1:05:13.676 --> 1:05:16.278
<i>and on demand wherever
you stream "Project Runway."</i>

1:05:17.279 --> 1:05:19.213
<i>On the next "Project Runway."</i>

1:05:19.281 --> 1:05:23.152
You will create an editorial
look for a photo shoot

1:05:23.218 --> 1:05:26.287
with<i> the</i> Coco Rocha.
- Oh, shut up.

1:05:26.289 --> 1:05:28.823
<i>- She is one of the best
editorial models</i>

1:05:28.891 --> 1:05:29.891
<i>you will ever see.</i>

1:05:29.958 --> 1:05:31.192
- Oh, my God.

1:05:31.260 --> 1:05:32.627
- You better not be underbudget.

1:05:32.695 --> 1:05:34.696
$800 and you're underbudget?

1:05:34.763 --> 1:05:36.831
I will cut you.
- Oh, my God.

1:05:36.899 --> 1:05:38.867
- Also think about,
like, up here.

1:05:38.869 --> 1:05:40.101
- Passion. Show me passion.

1:05:40.169 --> 1:05:41.770
- I want more movement.

1:05:41.837 --> 1:05:44.039
- Coco, can you angle more?

1:05:45.374 --> 1:05:46.942
- She doesn't take a bad photo.

1:05:47.777 --> 1:05:49.043
- On my shoots,

1:05:49.111 --> 1:05:51.779
the photographer would have
shut you down in two seconds.

1:05:51.847 --> 1:05:53.983
- It felt very '80s costume.

1:05:54.049 --> 1:05:55.884
- It was bizarre.
