You got nerve.

01:05.489 --> 01:10.560
There she is, six encores,
the voice that wouldn't stop.

01:11.010 --> 01:14.050
Well, they were just
such a great audience...

01:15.170 --> 01:18.000
They were such a great audience...

01:18.050 --> 01:21.490
-Well, this isn't good.
-Here, try some of this.

02:25.930 --> 02:31.080
Do, re, mi, fa, so not working.

02:31.930 --> 02:35.210
And it won't work if you keep talking.
You know, honey,

02:35.250 --> 02:38.530
this used to happen to me all the time
when l was out on tour.

02:38.570 --> 02:41.320
And the only thing that would help was
when your mama made me stop

02:41.370 --> 02:44.520
-and not talk for a while.
-l could do that.

02:44.570 --> 02:46.080
-Mile?
-What?

02:46.130 --> 02:48.880
-You're talking.
-Dang. Dang!

02:50.570 --> 02:52.800
There you go.
Now, listen, keep it like that,

02:52.850 --> 02:56.810
or we're gonna have to cancel
the big concert on Tv Saturday.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:09.250 --> 03:11.680
That's a girl.
Now, if you need to say anything

03:11.730 --> 03:13.720
for the next couple of days,
just use that.

03:13.770 --> 03:16.200
Hannah Montana has never
cancelled a concert before,

03:16.250 --> 03:21.040
and she's not about to start now.
l know that would just break your heart.

03:21.090 --> 03:24.480
And when your heart breaks, baby sis,
so does mine.

03:25.290 --> 03:29.000
''You got a hot date for the concert,
don't you, Jerkson?''

03:30.090 --> 03:32.080
-Dad.
-She wrote it.

03:32.690 --> 03:35.200
l can't believe you think that
l'm that selfish that l'd put my own...

03:35.250 --> 03:38.690
-What's her name, Son?
-Jenny. And she's a total babe.

03:39.210 --> 03:42.840
So put a cork in it, froggy.
l got a lot riding on this.

03:43.410 --> 03:45.050
Use the pad.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.400
Couldn't have said it better myself.

03:56.130 --> 03:57.610
Miley, l know you wanna get better,

03:57.650 --> 04:02.330
but sucking on those lollipops isn't
gonna do anything but rot your teeth.

04:12.050 --> 04:13.640
Miley, release.

04:16.649 --> 04:18.959
Fine. You leave me no choice.

04:19.450 --> 04:22.650
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

04:28.290 --> 04:29.850
Wow, a week without talking.

04:29.890 --> 04:32.240
You know, that's gotta be tough
for a girl. Now guys, we're different.

04:32.290 --> 04:34.930
l don't need to talk. l can not talk
for a month, wouldn't bother me at all.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.320
But, girls. Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

04:37.370 --> 04:40.490
''Hey, Sally, nice capris.''
''l love your purse.''

04:41.010 --> 04:42.920
Now, that's just rude.

04:43.570 --> 04:46.690
Miley, l know this is gonna be hard,
but you just have to stop fighting it.

04:46.730 --> 04:48.290
And don't worry, we're gonna be
right here for you

04:48.330 --> 04:49.440
until you get your voice back.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.370
-Hey, Lilly, you wanna catch a few?
-Oh, yeah.

04:56.050 --> 04:57.370
Please.

04:59.330 --> 05:00.730
Thank you.

05:03.410 --> 05:05.240
You know, this is nice.

05:05.290 --> 05:08.800
Just sitting here enjoying the sun,
the beach, the fresh air.

05:08.850 --> 05:12.360
That's the thing about nature,
it is just so quiet and peaceful.

05:12.410 --> 05:16.320
Not like the constant noise you get
when you're in the city.

05:16.810 --> 05:20.800
Pull the vehicle over. Pull...
l know, it drives me crazy, too.

05:22.770 --> 05:24.250
-Hey, Oliver.
-What up, Dex?

05:24.290 --> 05:27.010
Hey, Miley. Feeling better? Great.

05:27.050 --> 05:29.200
So, maybe if you're not
busy Friday night

05:29.250 --> 05:31.720
we could go to the movies
or something.

05:31.770 --> 05:33.810
l got this one for you.

05:37.010 --> 05:39.600
ln your dreams, Poindexter.

05:41.610 --> 05:43.730
We're playing hard to get.

05:45.370 --> 05:48.680
Okay, what she meant was,
''Movies, shmovies.''

05:48.730 --> 05:51.370
You should plant one on her
right now, big boy.

05:51.410 --> 05:52.680
Will you make up your mind?

05:52.730 --> 05:55.960
You know, we're sending Dex
mixed signals. And he's...

05:56.210 --> 05:57.720
Maybe another time.

06:06.210 --> 06:08.400
''Four score and seven years ago''

06:08.450 --> 06:10.960
is the beginning
of what famous speech?

06:11.010 --> 06:14.240
Finger on my hand,
find the smartest in the land.

06:14.730 --> 06:17.640
Keep sliding, Oken, l can still see you.

06:18.930 --> 06:20.760
Miley, make me smiley.

06:21.690 --> 06:23.200
l got this one for you.

06:23.250 --> 06:26.450
Miley's answer
is the Bettysburg Address.

06:29.410 --> 06:32.480
l think she means
Betty Burg's address.

06:34.610 --> 06:36.360
Who's Betty Burg?

06:36.890 --> 06:39.690
What? The only other thing on here is
''l heart Dex,''

06:39.730 --> 06:42.880
and l'm not gonna say that
with him sitting right there.

06:54.490 --> 06:58.960
Okay, it'll be one week
in exactly three, two, one.

06:59.330 --> 07:00.560
Speak.

07:03.490 --> 07:06.690
Darling, l know you're scared.
But we gotta find out sooner or later.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.960
Dad's right, Miles. Miles?

07:09.890 --> 07:12.400
Great, now she can't hear either.

07:13.970 --> 07:17.880
You are falling apart just when Jenny
and l need you the most.

07:17.930 --> 07:20.280
-That is so like you.
-Would you shut it already?

07:20.330 --> 07:22.920
l'm nervous enough,
and l don't know if l can...

07:22.970 --> 07:24.480
l can talk.

07:25.490 --> 07:26.680
Yeah.

07:27.090 --> 07:30.080
lt's so good to hear your voice again.

07:30.130 --> 07:31.800
''l heart Dex''?

07:32.610 --> 07:34.650
The last thing you wanna do
is overwork it.

07:34.690 --> 07:36.680
''Betty Burg's address''?

07:37.850 --> 07:40.730
Man, did you make her look dumb.

07:42.010 --> 07:46.400
-''Plant one on her right now, big boy''?
-Like you weren't thinking it.

07:46.450 --> 07:50.080
Okay, now we know Miley can talk.
Let's see if Hannah can sing.

07:50.130 --> 07:55.080
<i>Don't let no small frustratio</i> n
<i>Ever bring you dow</i> n

07:55.130 --> 07:56.320
<i>No, no, no, n</i> o

07:56.370 --> 08:01.810
<i>Just take a situatio</i> n
<i>And turn it all aroun</i> d

08:03.130 --> 08:06.490
<i>With a new attitud</i> e
<i>everything can chang</i> e

08:06.530 --> 08:09.680
<i>Make it how you want it to b</i> e

08:09.730 --> 08:12.850
<i>Staying mad, why do that</i> ?
<i>Give yourself a brea</i> k

08:12.890 --> 08:16.090
<i>Laugh about it and you'll se</i> e

08:16.130 --> 08:18.850
<i>Life's what you make i</i> t

08:18.890 --> 08:21.200
<i>So let's make it roc</i> k

08:21.250 --> 08:22.520
<i>Make it rock, yea</i> h

08:22.570 --> 08:25.880
<i>Life's what you make i</i> t
<i>So come o</i> n

08:25.930 --> 08:29.000
-<i>come o</i> n
-<i>come on, everybody no</i> w

08:30.690 --> 08:33.330
Jenny, isn't the concert wonderful?

08:33.690 --> 08:36.200
What's that? You bad girl.

08:38.289 --> 08:41.169
<i>Life's what you make i</i> t

08:41.210 --> 08:43.799
<i>So let's make it roc</i> k

08:44.930 --> 08:47.680
<i>Life's what you make i</i> t

08:47.730 --> 08:51.120
<i>So come o</i> n
<i>come o</i> n

08:56.530 --> 09:00.810
l'm sorry, Miley. This problem's
not going to go away on its own.

09:00.850 --> 09:05.210
lf you ever wanna sing again,
l'm afraid you're going to need surgery.

09:15.290 --> 09:16.690
Surgery?

09:17.890 --> 09:19.120
Really?

09:19.170 --> 09:22.530
Trust me, we're talking
about a very minor operation.

09:22.570 --> 09:24.720
l could do it blindfolded.

09:25.410 --> 09:28.210
l won't. l'm just saying that l could.

09:29.050 --> 09:32.200
Not that you'd know.
l mean, you'd be out cold.

09:32.490 --> 09:36.000
Doesn't that make you feel better?
lt doesn't, does it?

09:36.890 --> 09:38.800
l should stop now.

09:39.210 --> 09:40.640
You think?

09:41.210 --> 09:45.120
l'm sorry. l'm just trying to reassure you
that this surgery is no big deal.

09:45.170 --> 09:47.810
One hour in my office,
one week in recovery,

09:47.850 --> 09:50.240
-and you'll be as good as new, okay?
-Okay.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.560
Really, l mean,
the chances of anything going wrong

09:52.610 --> 09:55.760
and you permanently losing
your singing voice are one in a million.

09:55.810 --> 09:57.240
Oh, boy.

09:58.050 --> 10:01.250
One in a million?
Well, what if l'm that one?

10:01.290 --> 10:03.330
Doc, you were this close.

10:03.850 --> 10:07.810
Well, when l say one in a million,
it's just a figure of speech.

10:07.850 --> 10:10.680
l haven't done
anywhere near that many.

10:11.370 --> 10:14.730
Not that l haven't done a lot,
because l have.

10:14.770 --> 10:16.170
l'm going.

10:18.370 --> 10:20.600
Daddy, there was
a one in a million chance

10:20.650 --> 10:22.840
you'd be a rock star,
and that happened.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.770
There was a one in a million chance
l'd be a pop star,

10:24.810 --> 10:26.210
and that happened.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.400
Face it, this family's
one in a million central.

10:30.210 --> 10:32.400
Hey, Mile,
l really think you're overreacting.

10:32.450 --> 10:35.090
This guy's one of the best surgeons
in the country.

10:35.130 --> 10:36.960
Yeah, Dad's right.

10:37.930 --> 10:40.400
Besides, what do you think's
gonna happen?

10:40.450 --> 10:42.570
Just as the surgery's
about ready to start,

10:42.610 --> 10:47.210
a meteor hits a bus.
The bus drives into a hotdog stand,

10:47.250 --> 10:50.610
a giant neon wiener flies
into the power lines,

10:50.650 --> 10:53.530
the lights go off in the operating room,
and the next thing you know,

10:53.570 --> 10:55.800
you're spending the rest of your life
singing like Aunt Pearl

10:55.850 --> 10:58.760
after she swallowed that kazoo.
Remember?

11:02.010 --> 11:05.130
Oh, no. l'm never gonna be
Hannah Montana again

11:05.170 --> 11:07.360
all because of a giant wiener.

11:16.330 --> 11:19.720
<i>Here you go, Miley</i>.
<i>l want you to open this one next</i>.

11:24.810 --> 11:28.090
<i>Yes, just what l wanted</i>.
<i>Now l can be just like Daddy</i>.

11:28.130 --> 11:30.090
<i>Let's hear something</i>.

11:31.810 --> 11:34.040
<i>Rock, rock, roc</i> k
<i>Yeah, yeah, yea</i> h

11:34.090 --> 11:38.640
<i>Rock, rock, roc</i> k
<i>Oh, yea</i> h

11:38.690 --> 11:42.000
<i>l love you, Tennessee</i>.
<i>Good night. Drive careful</i>.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.810
<i>Did you hear that, babe</i> ?

11:43.850 --> 11:46.520
<i>This little girl might just end u</i> p
<i>giving you a run for your money</i>.

11:46.570 --> 11:49.640
<i>Well, maybe one day l might jus</i> t
<i>have to take you up on stage with me</i>.

11:49.690 --> 11:51.840
<i>Encore, encore, encore</i>.

11:53.650 --> 11:57.640
<i>Jingle bells, Jackson smell</i> s
<i>from 1 5 miles awa</i> y

11:57.690 --> 12:01.320
-<i>l'm gonna get you, runt</i>.
-<i>Help</i>!

12:01.850 --> 12:04.120
<i>Hey, no running in the house</i>.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.320
-<i>He did it</i>.
-<i>She did it</i>.

12:07.370 --> 12:09.680
<i>Don't you just love christmas</i> ?

12:11.090 --> 12:12.440
Hey, Mile.

12:13.170 --> 12:16.610
l made you a cup
of my famous loco hot cocoa

12:16.650 --> 12:19.720
with little marshmallows
so you don't choke-o.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.600
Choke-o.

12:22.050 --> 12:23.400
Choke-o.

12:23.650 --> 12:26.880
l'm gonna keep saying it
until you laugh. Choke-o.

12:26.930 --> 12:30.210
Daddy, what if something goes wrong
in the surgery,

12:30.250 --> 12:32.970
and l can't be
Hannah Montana any more?

12:33.330 --> 12:37.530
Well, then, l guess you'll just have
to pack your bags and get out.

12:39.170 --> 12:42.480
Baby, that's not gonna happen.
Everything's gonna be fine.

12:42.530 --> 12:45.120
The only thing you need to worry about
is what flavour ice cream

12:45.170 --> 12:47.360
you're gonna be scarfing down
after it's over.

12:47.410 --> 12:48.520
How do you know that?

12:48.570 --> 12:50.960
'Cause there's some things in life
a daddy just knows.

12:51.010 --> 12:53.760
Like, l know the sun's gonna come up
tomorrow morning.

12:53.810 --> 12:57.280
l know Uncle Earl's never gonna be
an underwear model.

12:57.970 --> 13:00.720
And l know your voice is gonna be fine.

13:01.690 --> 13:03.920
You get some rest now, bud.

13:03.970 --> 13:06.090
-Good night, Dad.
-Night.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.080
-Love you.
-Love you.

13:28.890 --> 13:30.080
Miley!

13:31.050 --> 13:33.640
Where is that useless freeloader?

13:35.330 --> 13:37.130
Right here, Daddy.

13:38.090 --> 13:41.210
l thought l told you to iron these socks.

13:41.250 --> 13:44.450
You know how l like a nice crease
in my hosiery.

13:45.650 --> 13:48.560
Sorry, Daddy,
l'm still cleaning the oven.

13:48.610 --> 13:52.280
Wait a minute, what's that
on the corner of your mouth?

13:53.770 --> 13:57.920
Have you been eating the burnt bits
off the broiler pan again?

13:58.410 --> 14:01.130
Sorry, Daddy. l'm just so hungry.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.970
Month-old trout skin, my favourite.

14:09.810 --> 14:13.120
Well, quit stuffing your face
and get to ironing.

14:13.890 --> 14:17.250
Just because that surgery
caused you to lose your singing voice

14:17.290 --> 14:19.800
doesn't mean you can lay around here
licking up trout drippings

14:19.850 --> 14:22.080
like the Queen of Sheba.

14:22.130 --> 14:25.600
But l can sing, Daddy.
l've been practising. Listen.

14:26.010 --> 14:32.320
<i>This is the lif</i> e

14:35.610 --> 14:38.650
Don't ever do that again.

14:40.330 --> 14:41.520
Okay.

14:42.410 --> 14:45.210
Now, there's only person
in this house that can sing,

14:45.250 --> 14:47.600
and we all know who that is.

14:47.930 --> 14:50.240
<i>Jingle bells, Miley smell</i> s

14:50.290 --> 14:55.600
<i>from 50 miles away, yea</i> h

14:55.650 --> 14:57.840
Ladies and gentlemen,

14:57.890 --> 15:01.280
please welcome Bucky Kentucky.

15:01.330 --> 15:03.480
Thank you. Thank you.

15:04.610 --> 15:08.680
But Jackson could never sing.
And Bucky Kentucky?

15:08.730 --> 15:10.610
That's the dumbest name
l've ever heard.

15:10.650 --> 15:11.800
You're just jealous
'cause you don't have

15:11.850 --> 15:13.890
a state that rhymes
with your name any more,

15:13.930 --> 15:16.890
little miss nobody.

15:18.530 --> 15:22.200
Please, like anyone would
ever be a fan of Bucky Kentucky.

15:22.810 --> 15:26.090
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
lt's Bucky Kentucky!

15:26.130 --> 15:30.730
-lt's Bucky Kentucky!
-Dude, dude, dude, dude, you rock!

15:30.770 --> 15:32.570
l love you!

15:33.810 --> 15:36.800
Guys, what are you doing?
lt's Jackson.

15:36.850 --> 15:38.440
-l'm sorry, did you hear something?
-Yeah.

15:38.490 --> 15:41.080
lt sounds like a washed-up pop star.

15:41.890 --> 15:45.360
Let's go kids, or we're gonna be late
for Bucky's big concert.

15:45.410 --> 15:49.000
-The limo's waiting.
-Last one in is a Miley.

15:51.130 --> 15:54.880
Guys, what about me?
l should be going to the concert, too.

15:55.770 --> 15:57.840
l was Hannah Montana once.

15:58.690 --> 16:02.240
Please don't treat me like this.
l have feelings.

16:02.890 --> 16:06.090
l'm not a piece of furniture. Guys.

16:07.450 --> 16:10.040
l'm not a piece of furniture.

16:11.170 --> 16:12.920
Okay, maybe l am.

16:14.010 --> 16:17.640
Hang on, kids. l've just gotta grab
my keys and my wallet.

16:17.690 --> 16:19.330
There they are.

16:20.250 --> 16:24.160
Daddy, what happened to me?
l'm nothing but a table.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.760
Honey, you're much more than that.

16:28.210 --> 16:30.250
You're also a coat rack.

16:31.370 --> 16:32.930
Sweet niblets.

16:33.570 --> 16:35.560
We'd love to take you
along with us, Mile,

16:35.610 --> 16:38.250
but you just got too many hang-ups.

16:39.650 --> 16:43.120
-Hey, that's a good one, Daddy.
-See, l told you l was funny.

16:44.050 --> 16:46.520
No, don't leave.

16:47.090 --> 16:50.240
Somebody help me. Please.

16:51.130 --> 16:54.600
Baby girl, you always did have
the strangest dreams.

16:54.650 --> 16:55.920
Mama?

16:57.730 --> 17:00.240
Mom, it is you.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.079
Sorry.

17:04.450 --> 17:06.410
Your daddy gave you
some of his loco hot cocoa

17:06.450 --> 17:10.329
before bed again, didn't he?
He knows what sugar does to you.

17:10.890 --> 17:13.960
l swear, when l'm finished here,
l'm popping in to one of his dreams.

17:14.010 --> 17:16.130
He is gonna get an earful.

17:17.730 --> 17:19.210
Not helping.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.640
lt's your dream, sweet pea.

17:21.690 --> 17:24.440
lf you don't like it,
all you have to do is change it.

17:24.490 --> 17:26.210
lt's not that easy.

17:27.329 --> 17:29.320
Hey, maybe it was.

17:30.610 --> 17:33.250
Where were you
when l was eating trout skin?

17:33.930 --> 17:36.440
All right, baby girl, we both know
you didn't dream me here

17:36.490 --> 17:40.720
to ask me that. Now why don't you
tell me what's really on your mind?

17:40.770 --> 17:42.600
l lost my voice.

17:43.570 --> 17:46.240
And if it doesn't come back, then...

17:47.890 --> 17:50.450
-Then...
-Miley, do you really think

17:50.490 --> 17:55.040
if you're not Hannah Montana, you're
no better than a piece of furniture?

17:56.490 --> 17:59.210
Look at that thing. l swear,
there is nothing more dangerous

17:59.250 --> 18:00.920
than your daddy
with a pocket full of cash

18:00.970 --> 18:03.720
and one of Uncle Earl's garage sales.

18:04.130 --> 18:07.200
Mom, if l can't sing, then l'm just...

18:09.290 --> 18:10.770
l'm just Miley.

18:11.530 --> 18:14.360
And what in the world
is wrong with that?

18:14.410 --> 18:17.400
l think just Miley is pretty darn terrific.

18:17.450 --> 18:20.410
And l know that she is strong enough
to handle anything.

18:20.450 --> 18:22.280
-She is?
-Heck, yeah.

18:22.330 --> 18:25.400
That's the way your daddy
and l raised you.

18:25.450 --> 18:29.000
You're a wonderful girl, and that's why
your friends love you so much.

18:29.050 --> 18:32.170
What friends?
You saw the way they treated me.

18:32.210 --> 18:35.250
For heaven's sake.
Lilly, Oliver, get in here.

18:37.610 --> 18:40.330
lf she wasn't Hannah Montana,
would you still be her friends?

18:40.370 --> 18:43.760
Are you kidding? Of course we would.

18:43.810 --> 18:45.040
Miley, you were my best friend

18:45.090 --> 18:47.840
way before l knew
you were Hannah Montana.

18:47.890 --> 18:50.240
Then why'd you all just walk out
on me?

18:50.290 --> 18:52.330
-lt's your dream.
-lt's your dream.

18:52.690 --> 18:54.170
And it was only scary

18:54.210 --> 18:56.960
because you're so worried
about that surgery tomorrow.

18:57.010 --> 19:00.920
lt's true, Miles.
ln real life, l sing like a starving walrus.

19:02.650 --> 19:05.640
Mom, this is where you say,
''No, you don't, honey.''

19:05.690 --> 19:08.970
No, you don't, honey.
Just a regular walrus.

19:09.410 --> 19:12.400
-A cute, tone-deaf walrus.
-Thanks.

19:12.850 --> 19:16.210
-l like your mom. She's funny.
-She's pretty, too.

19:16.970 --> 19:19.280
That's it. You're out of here.

19:19.690 --> 19:22.920
Hey, why am l leaving?
l don't wanna go. Stop!

19:23.290 --> 19:25.010
This is not fair!

19:25.810 --> 19:29.250
The point is, whether you're
Hannah Montana or just Miley,

19:29.290 --> 19:32.840
you're still gonna be the annoying,
obnoxious little sister.

19:32.890 --> 19:34.610
That l love.

19:40.170 --> 19:43.450
-Okay, you can wake up anytime now.
-l ain't done yet.

19:43.810 --> 19:45.880
You see, no matter what happens
to your voice,

19:45.930 --> 19:48.200
you have the most important thing
a person can have.

19:48.250 --> 19:51.530
-People who care about you.
-You're right, Mommy.

19:52.290 --> 19:53.690
You think?

19:55.090 --> 19:57.600
What the heck?
Oliver, get back in here.

19:57.650 --> 19:59.130
Thank you.

20:01.130 --> 20:03.280
You were loved
before you were Hannah Montana,

20:03.330 --> 20:04.890
and you'll be loved long after

20:04.930 --> 20:08.240
Hannah's on one of those
''Where Are They Now'' shows.

20:08.570 --> 20:11.240
l think you're confusing me with Dad.

20:12.290 --> 20:15.090
l am not worried about you one bit.

20:16.170 --> 20:20.530
-l miss your hugs, Mom.
-Baby girl, they're never far away.

20:21.530 --> 20:23.840
All you have to do is think about me.

20:23.890 --> 20:27.720
Now, listen, say goodbye
to your friends and get some sleep.

20:31.770 --> 20:33.730
You did good, honey.

20:33.770 --> 20:36.360
You're doing
a pretty good job yourself.

20:36.410 --> 20:38.920
Except for that hot chocolate
before bed.

20:38.970 --> 20:43.360
Yeah, about that. l know you always
told me not to do that,

20:43.410 --> 20:47.610
but this was a very emotional...
Miley, you can wake up now.

20:47.890 --> 20:50.400
Robby Ray, how many times
do l have to tell you?

20:50.450 --> 20:52.570
Miley, wakey, wakey.

20:52.810 --> 20:54.960
l cannot believe
you still have that table.

20:55.010 --> 20:57.730
No wonder
the girl's having nightmares.

20:57.930 --> 21:01.370
l'm sorry, darling.
You know l always was a pushover.

21:02.450 --> 21:04.090
That you were.

21:21.890 --> 21:27.120
<i>'cause it's you and m</i> e

21:27.170 --> 21:29.760

21:29.810 --> 21:32.800
Don't be scared, baby girl.
The surgeon did a wonderful job.

21:32.850 --> 21:35.520
Your voice sounds better than ever.
Come on.

21:35.570 --> 21:41.800

-Jackson, cut it out, boy.
-Hey, it's your dream.

22:02.250 --> 22:03.920
Not this time.

22:03.970 --> 22:08.120
Well, if it's not your dream,
and it's not mine, then whose is it?

22:08.490 --> 22:09.840
l think l know.

22:16.090 --> 22:18.840
Mama was right
about that hot chocolate.
