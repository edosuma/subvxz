00:38.720 --> 00:39.804

for us to fix it

about life.

01:16.136 --> 01:18.804

20:47.512 --> 20:52.178
Try this--
are you going to buy something?

20:52.261 --> 20:54.303
Are you going to buy something?

20:54.387 --> 20:57.595
Nah, auctions
remind me too much of slavery.

20:57.679 --> 20:59.303
So you had me
repeat the question

20:59.387 --> 21:02.303
- just so you could say that.

21:02.387 --> 21:04.845
Anyway, speaking of slavery,

21:04.929 --> 21:07.720
uh, I got an extra ticket
to the Civil Rights exhibit.

21:07.804 --> 21:09.095
Want to roll?

21:09.178 --> 21:11.512
You just happen to have
two tickets?

21:11.595 --> 21:13.136
Yeah.

21:13.220 --> 21:15.679
Did anybody ever tell you
you're a really bad liar?

21:15.762 --> 21:18.387
- Just meet me there tomorrow.
- Don't get mannish.

21:20.178 --> 21:22.053
You gonna meet me there or not?

21:24.970 --> 21:26.929
Are you going to meet me there
or not?

21:28.553 --> 21:29.553
I'll be there.

21:34.512 --> 21:36.428
The plan is to open
a brand-new wing

21:36.512 --> 21:39.428
at the Cancer Research Center
by third quarter next year.

21:39.512 --> 21:41.720
Brandon, who was one of
our early board members,

21:41.804 --> 21:44.220
came in, helped us with
a great first round of funding.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.553
Why is everybody hangin' off
your daddy's nut sack?

21:46.637 --> 21:47.929
'Cause he got money.

21:50.970 --> 21:52.512
Does he like
donating to campaigns?

21:52.595 --> 21:53.929
Depends on the candidate.

22:01.261 --> 22:04.428
Uh, Mr. St. John,
sorry to interrupt, but...

22:04.512 --> 22:06.387
...I think
you should know my dad.

22:06.470 --> 22:08.679
Yes, Mr. Perry.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.720
How's the mayoral
campaign going?

22:10.804 --> 22:12.679
It's going great.
It's going great.

22:12.762 --> 22:15.303
- Oh, I, uh, see your wife

22:15.387 --> 22:16.679
is helping you
on the campaign trail.

22:16.762 --> 22:18.095
Mm-hmm.

22:20.595 --> 22:23.303
I didn't know
you had a son.

22:23.387 --> 22:25.595
Yeah, Jacob here
is a more recent blessing.

22:25.679 --> 22:27.303
His brother
used to work for me,

22:27.387 --> 22:30.970
but, unfortunately,
gun violence claimed his life.

22:31.053 --> 22:34.387
Man, I remember what it used
to be like on the South Side.

22:34.470 --> 22:36.637
You know, nowhere to turn,
nobody to look up to.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.970
Felt like I was all alone.

22:39.053 --> 22:40.887
Jacob's mother--
she's in rehab right now

22:40.970 --> 22:42.637
fighting to stay clean.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.178
So he needed
a roof over his head

22:44.261 --> 22:46.261
and somebody that would
always be there for him.

22:46.345 --> 22:49.220
And rather than
trying to find that person...

22:49.303 --> 22:51.428
I decided to be that person.

22:51.512 --> 22:54.553
- I'm in the process of, uh...

22:54.637 --> 22:56.679
adopting him.

22:56.762 --> 22:57.970
I've always wanted a son.

23:00.637 --> 23:02.929
My wife and I--we weren't able
to have children,

23:03.011 --> 23:07.136
so he is truly
an answered prayer.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.345
Well, that's quite a story.

23:09.428 --> 23:11.387
Yeah, you know,
and I wish more folks

23:11.470 --> 23:13.178
were doing what I'm doing,

23:13.261 --> 23:15.679
and there would be a lot less
violence out on the streets.

23:58.387 --> 24:01.345
in the separation
of church and state...

24:01.428 --> 24:03.637
'cause I don't understand
how you can vote for somebody

24:03.720 --> 24:05.220
that don't vote for God.

24:07.470 --> 24:10.220
I want to vote
for a politician

24:10.303 --> 24:13.261
that believes
in putting God first.

24:13.345 --> 24:15.470
So tonight
I'm gonna bring you someone

24:15.553 --> 24:18.553
who's not afraid to put prayer
back in politics.

24:18.637 --> 24:22.303
So please give a warm welcome
to my longtime friend

24:22.387 --> 24:25.261
and the woman who hopefully is
gonna be Chicago's next mayor,

24:25.345 --> 24:27.053
Miss Camille Hallaway.

24:27.136 --> 24:30.095
- Whoo-hoo!

24:32.720 --> 24:34.261
How y'all doing tonight?

24:34.345 --> 24:35.595
You good?

24:41.929 --> 24:45.303
Did y'all read
the headlines this morning?

24:45.387 --> 24:47.679
Yeah, a little boy
was shot and killed

24:47.762 --> 24:51.011
in front of his mother's house
in broad daylight.

24:51.095 --> 24:52.512
Last week I read about

24:52.595 --> 24:54.595
a young lady
that's gone missing,

24:54.679 --> 24:56.845
and her parents are doing
everything they can to find her

24:56.929 --> 25:00.303
because the police
aren't being helpful.

25:00.387 --> 25:02.387
Now, I was supposed
to come up here

25:02.470 --> 25:06.512
and talk about my plans
to get this city working again,

25:06.595 --> 25:10.178
to work on improving
our failed school system,

25:10.261 --> 25:14.345
but it's hard to do that
when our children aren't safe.

25:14.428 --> 25:17.303
Now, that's not the Chicago
I remember.

25:17.387 --> 25:19.553
I could play outside all day.

25:19.637 --> 25:21.929
My mother
was gainfully employed.

25:22.011 --> 25:23.553
When I got out of line,

25:23.637 --> 25:26.470
my neighbors
would discipline me.

25:26.553 --> 25:29.303
That's the Chicago
I know and love.

25:29.387 --> 25:31.387
I often hear
people talking about,

25:31.470 --> 25:33.095
where are our
black leaders at?

25:33.178 --> 25:35.136
Who's the next MLK?

25:35.220 --> 25:37.804
Where's Malcolm? Who gonna be
the next Shirley Chisholm?

25:37.887 --> 25:39.720
But I'm here to tell you,

25:39.804 --> 25:42.303
it's time to stop looking
to other people

25:42.387 --> 25:44.136
to lead you
to the promised land.

25:44.220 --> 25:45.762
-  That's right.
- I ain't Jesus.

25:45.845 --> 25:48.553
- You got that right.
- I'm just a woman

25:48.637 --> 25:52.136
standing before you,
asking you to lead yourselves.

25:52.220 --> 25:54.637
See, I don't want to
walk in front of you.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.970
I want to walk alongside you,

25:57.053 --> 25:58.845
because we're all
in this together.

25:58.929 --> 26:01.053
-  Yeah.
- This is our city.

26:01.136 --> 26:03.512
Our ancestors built this city,

26:03.595 --> 26:06.011
brick by brick,
with bloody hands.

26:06.095 --> 26:08.887
And how dare we
spill each other's blood on

26:08.970 --> 26:11.136
- the streets they marched on?

26:11.220 --> 26:13.720
It's time for us
to stop playing the blame game

26:13.804 --> 26:16.220
and become the heroes
we in here praying for.

26:16.303 --> 26:18.553
Now, my opponent--
Otis or Douda

26:18.637 --> 26:20.345
or whatever he want to
call himself this week--

26:20.428 --> 26:22.136
don't care about you.

26:22.220 --> 26:25.595
All he wants is a bigger office
with a nice view.

26:25.679 --> 26:27.762
And to be real, that's what
most politicians want.

26:27.845 --> 26:30.178
But lucky for you,
I'm not a politician.

26:30.261 --> 26:31.887
I'm a chick from the South Side

26:31.970 --> 26:34.345
whose grandmother was a part
of the Great Migration

26:34.428 --> 26:36.470
and whose mom fought
for civil rights.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.679
I'm not here
to give you talking points.

26:38.762 --> 26:40.220
I'm here to ask questions,

26:40.303 --> 26:42.637
like, why in the last 15 years

26:42.720 --> 26:46.720
has Chicago lost
over 250,000 black residents

26:46.804 --> 26:49.220
'cause they could no longer
afford to live here?

26:49.303 --> 26:52.387
Why is the lifespan
in Englewood 30 years less

26:52.470 --> 26:54.845
than those living
in the Gold Coast?

26:54.929 --> 26:57.053
Why do they keep shutting down
mental-health clinics

26:57.136 --> 26:59.970
and schools on the South Side?

27:00.053 --> 27:02.637
These are questions
I don't have the answers to.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.470
But if you put me in office,

27:04.553 --> 27:06.762
I'll make it my business
to go get us some.

27:06.845 --> 27:09.553
Now, a lot of y'all
don't know me, and that's okay.

27:09.637 --> 27:11.428
But over the course
of this campaign,

27:11.512 --> 27:14.512
I promise
to let you into my home.

27:14.595 --> 27:16.720
I want you to meet my family.

27:16.804 --> 27:20.887
I want you to know how I became
the woman I am today.

27:20.970 --> 27:23.136
Now, before you go digging,
I'll tell you right now,

27:23.220 --> 27:24.804
I ain't perfect.

27:24.887 --> 27:27.053
I have not always done
the right thing.

27:27.136 --> 27:29.595
But guess what.
Neither have you.

27:29.679 --> 27:33.470
So I implore you not to demand
something of your leaders

27:33.553 --> 27:35.553
you don't demand of yourself.

27:35.637 --> 27:38.428
We're all made in God's image,

27:38.512 --> 27:40.720
and we've all done
our share of sinning.

27:40.804 --> 27:42.595
But that don't
have nothing to do

27:42.679 --> 27:44.804
with me making
Chicago great again.

27:44.887 --> 27:46.762
And that's what
I've come here to do.

27:46.845 --> 27:49.095
And if you with me,
let me get an "amen."

27:49.178 --> 27:51.804

I really like that girl Jemma.

Yeah. Me too.

feeling sorry for me.

28:51.178 --> 28:53.553
You always had
a way with words,

28:53.637 --> 28:55.845
even when you were
a little girl.

28:55.929 --> 28:57.637
They're not just words, Pastor.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.178
I meant what I said.

28:59.261 --> 29:01.053
Hey, you don't have to
convince me.

29:01.136 --> 29:02.595
You already have my vote.

29:02.679 --> 29:03.804
I appreciate you.

29:03.887 --> 29:06.720
What she paying you for, Dad?

Tiff, you seem bothered
by that statement.

30:14.136 --> 30:15.261
We have a son together.

30:15.345 --> 30:16.762
How much more connected
can we be?

30:16.845 --> 30:18.637
Well, having a child
actually makes it difficult

30:18.720 --> 30:20.136
for parents to be connected.

30:20.220 --> 30:22.136
They often get bogged down
by the responsibilities

30:22.220 --> 30:23.845
that go along
with being a parent.

30:23.929 --> 30:26.261
Well, I'm usually the one that
does most of the parenting.

30:26.345 --> 30:27.762
See, that's my other issue.

30:27.845 --> 30:29.303
No matter how much
I do for our son,

30:29.387 --> 30:30.804
she don't be appreciating shit.

30:30.887 --> 30:32.428
I'm not gonna give you
a round of applause

30:32.512 --> 30:33.720
every time you take him
to the park.

30:33.804 --> 30:35.428
I'm not asking
for a round of applause.

30:35.512 --> 30:36.887
Well, what do you want, then?

30:36.970 --> 30:38.470
I want us to have sex
twice a week.

30:38.553 --> 30:39.887
Oh, so that's what
this is about?

30:39.970 --> 30:42.261
When couples aren't having sex,
there's usually

30:42.345 --> 30:44.220
- a bigger problem at hand.
-  Like what?

30:44.303 --> 30:46.095
Well, that's what we're here
to find out.

30:46.178 --> 30:49.095
Negro, I work all day, and
I take care of our son at night

30:49.178 --> 30:52.261
while you out slinging barbecue
with some bitch.

30:52.345 --> 30:54.762
When am I supposed to find time
to fuck you twice a week?

30:54.845 --> 30:55.720
I don't know,
but you need to find it.

30:55.804 --> 30:57.261
Let's not make demands.

30:57.345 --> 30:58.595
If we don't figure
this shit out, I'll go

30:58.679 --> 31:00.220
- find mine somewhere else.
- Are you s--

31:00.303 --> 31:01.470
Threats aren't helpful,
either.

31:01.553 --> 31:03.345
Really, nigga?
After all we've been through,

31:03.428 --> 31:05.220
you gonna sit here
and threaten me with that shit?

31:05.303 --> 31:07.595
I don't want to be that nigga,
but what do you want me to do?

31:07.679 --> 31:10.387
Jerk off or something.

31:10.470 --> 31:12.345
- See what I'm sayin'?
- Tiffany.

31:12.428 --> 31:14.303
Let's talk about
what you need from Emmett

31:14.387 --> 31:15.887
in order for you
to want to be intimate.

31:15.970 --> 31:19.220
He can start
by doing the dishes.

31:19.303 --> 31:20.470
All right, fine.

31:20.553 --> 31:22.303
But don't do it just for that.

31:22.387 --> 31:24.387
All I know is you better not
be fuckin' somebody else.

31:24.470 --> 31:25.679
I'm not like you.

31:25.762 --> 31:28.136
I don't know.
You Scorpios is savage.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.720
Here you go.

31:29.804 --> 31:31.136
You must've been talkin'

31:31.220 --> 31:33.470
to your trifling-ass daddy.

31:33.553 --> 31:34.845
That's his problem.

31:34.929 --> 31:36.512
How you gonna
take relationship advice

31:36.595 --> 31:38.011
from somebody
who got seven kids

31:38.095 --> 31:39.512
by five different baby mamas,

31:39.595 --> 31:41.095
and he about to get
another divorce?

31:42.595 --> 31:43.929
Huh?

31:45.470 --> 31:47.136
You want to know
why I ain't fucking you?

31:47.220 --> 31:49.011
Please tell me.

31:49.095 --> 31:51.804
'Cause I ain't trying
to get pregnant again.

31:51.887 --> 31:53.845
I thought--I thought
you was on birth control.

31:53.929 --> 31:57.095
I got off.
Had my hormones all jacked up.

31:57.178 --> 31:58.595
Okay, I'll wear a condom.

31:58.679 --> 31:59.929
Nigga, please.

32:00.011 --> 32:01.679
