WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:04.305
JAMES: Previously
on "Queen of the South"...

00:04.338 --> 00:05.473
I never had a first
anniversary before.

00:05.506 --> 00:06.740
I love you.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.409
LOYA: Guero's dead.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.444
Aah! Uh!

00:12.913 --> 00:14.548
I deal in nothing less
than metric tons.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.317
We'll take the ton.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.086
There's no way we can
distribute this amount.

00:18.119 --> 00:20.054
If we don't get
that first payment,

00:20.088 --> 00:21.722
a fleet of El Santo's hit men

00:21.755 --> 00:23.357
are gonna be
on the next flight to Dallas.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.193
I understand
I put us in danger.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.528
Devon Finch gets a hundred
offers a day.

00:27.561 --> 00:28.862
CAMILA: I'm not interested
in investing

00:28.896 --> 00:30.264
in Finch's companies.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.932
I'm interested
in distribution

00:31.965 --> 00:33.534
and money laundering
through them.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.035
Today we announce the formation

00:35.069 --> 00:38.005
of a joint U.S.-Mexico
drug task force.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.540
(dramatic music)

00:41.309 --> 00:44.278
(mariachi music)

00:44.312 --> 00:45.513
*

00:45.546 --> 00:48.082
Feliz cumpleaÃ±os,
a la jefa.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.452
Gracias, Pote.
It's a beautiful cake.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.756
Thank you.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.126
-Salud.
ALL: Salud.

01:04.232 --> 01:06.134
This lovely gift from my family

01:06.167 --> 01:08.102
and not a single word
from my only daughter.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.772
I hope you enjoy
your decorative spoons.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.509
Beautiful, Pote.
Well done.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.246
Your lawyer
didn't forget you.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.985
It's beautiful.

01:28.356 --> 01:31.625
I still have to receive
the only present that I need.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.761
Devon Finch.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.796
He's not gonna work with us.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.866
Then we're gonna have
to twist his hand, don't we?

01:40.434 --> 01:42.303
We need his transpo,
he needs our product.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.004
He just doesn't know it yet.

01:44.037 --> 01:47.074
All of you are going
to Chicago.

01:47.107 --> 01:50.444
You're gonna spread El Santo's
dust on the streets.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.513
And I can guarantee you
that once his clients

01:52.546 --> 01:54.848
-get a taste for it--
-They'll come to us.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.450
CAMILA: And so will Devon.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.952
He thinks his business
is untouchable.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.855
We're gonna show him it's not.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.857
You're gonna find
his Tastemaker

02:03.891 --> 02:05.359
and make him buy from us.

02:05.393 --> 02:07.495
And if he doesn't,
then what?

02:08.862 --> 02:10.964
Then we're just gonna
have to strike.

02:10.998 --> 02:13.534
Spreading coke on his territory
is one thing.

02:13.567 --> 02:16.304
An outright attack
on his operation...

02:16.337 --> 02:18.005
that's just asking
for trouble.

02:22.210 --> 02:25.313
I never had to ask you twice
to do something.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.681
Today is not the day
to start, James.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.184
I'm going to need intel
on his jet

02:30.218 --> 02:31.819
before we can move on.

02:36.056 --> 02:37.525
Can you handle it?

02:40.093 --> 02:42.896
(speaking Spanish)

02:45.399 --> 02:49.136
Look at you.
The picture of devotion.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.038
(speaking Spanish)

02:53.040 --> 02:56.009
(tense music)

02:56.043 --> 03:01.048
*

03:04.518 --> 03:07.488
As you know, Epifanio is in
Dallas, working with the DEA.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.723
He's trying
to shut you down.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.191
Or plan another attack.

03:11.225 --> 03:14.528
Either way, it's crucial
that this works.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.864
Come.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.600
Devon's Tastemaker throws
a party for his customers

03:19.633 --> 03:22.370
every week
at Chicago's best hotel.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.238
I need you to get him
to try our product

03:24.272 --> 03:26.374
while James works on
the other customers,

03:26.407 --> 03:28.942
the high rollers who play poker
at the party.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.712
Once Devon grants us
a proper meeting,

03:31.745 --> 03:35.349
You, Pote, and James
can come back home.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.050
Guero won't be joining you.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.521
I need him to go to Chicago

03:40.554 --> 03:43.190
to research Devon's planes.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.560
But after that,
either you cut him off

03:46.594 --> 03:47.561
or I will.

03:47.595 --> 03:54.435
*

03:54.468 --> 03:57.204
MAN: * Hey! Raindrops,
drop top, drop top *

03:57.237 --> 03:59.206
* Smokin' on cookie
in the hot box *

03:59.239 --> 04:00.974
* [...] on your [...],
she a thot, thot, thot *

04:01.008 --> 04:02.976
* Cookin' up [...]
in the crock pot, pot *

04:03.010 --> 04:04.612
* We came from nothin'
to somethin'... *

04:04.645 --> 04:06.414
(elevator bell dings)

04:06.447 --> 04:08.382
(indistinct chatter)

04:08.416 --> 04:10.551
We're on our way in.
I'll talk to you later.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.519
Bye.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.988
All right, you're good.
Good to go.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.591
Thank you.

04:18.859 --> 04:19.927
Don't touch me.

04:23.531 --> 04:24.798
(speaking Spanish)

04:27.668 --> 04:30.671
(inhaling deeply)

04:30.704 --> 04:32.706
(sighs)

04:45.486 --> 04:47.154
My 25 plus...

04:50.691 --> 04:52.360
30.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.195
Chips or cash only.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.664
Excuse me?

04:56.697 --> 04:58.165
Are you in the hand?

05:10.478 --> 05:12.312
The powder plays.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.916
Call.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.563
DEALER: Straight beats
a set of aces.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.098
Son of a bitch!

05:37.037 --> 05:39.940
Hey.
How much for the blow?

05:41.341 --> 05:42.275
30.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.786
(crowd murmurs)

05:59.727 --> 06:01.762
MAN: * Don't move too fast,
I might shoot ya *

06:01.795 --> 06:03.531
* Draco bad and boujee

06:03.564 --> 06:05.365
* I'm always hangin'
with shooters *

06:05.399 --> 06:07.601
* Might be posted
somewhere secluded *

06:07.635 --> 06:10.971
So that's him.
Devon's Tastemaker.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.608
If anything goes wrong
and you need to signal,

06:14.642 --> 06:16.910
drop these on the floor
and break 'em.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.948
Now's not the time
to play hard to get.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.051
Go.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.055
MAN: * I gave her ten racks,
I told her go shoppin' *

06:28.088 --> 06:29.790
* And spend it all
at the pop-up *

06:29.823 --> 06:31.525
* These [...], they [...],
suck [...] *

06:31.559 --> 06:33.026
* And they bustin'
for Instagram *

06:33.060 --> 06:34.127
* Get your Klout up, uh

06:34.161 --> 06:35.963
* Yeah, that way

06:35.996 --> 06:37.798
* Float on the track
like a Segway *

06:37.831 --> 06:39.600
* Yeah, that way...

06:39.633 --> 06:40.601
What are you having?

06:42.235 --> 06:43.804
Something you can't handle.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.173
(chuckling)
Well, you'd be surprised.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.109
Bolivian.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.444
Cooked with ether.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.981
Can you handle that?

06:54.014 --> 06:56.316
Tell me,
who the fuck are you

06:56.349 --> 06:58.619
and what the hell
are you doing at my party?

06:58.652 --> 07:00.888
I work with Camila Vargas.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.223
I'm not here for trouble.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.825
I'm here to make a deal.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.794
You're gonna taste this.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.309
TASTEMAKER: Bleach.
The purer it is--

07:22.342 --> 07:23.777
The less it dissolves.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.856
(dramatic music)

07:35.889 --> 07:42.896
*

07:53.040 --> 07:55.509
You kidding me? No one cooks
with ether anymore.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.377
That shit's insane.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.046
There's more
where that came from.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.514
How much more?

08:00.548 --> 08:03.083
Quarter of a metric ton.
30K a kilo.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.388
I'll give you 20.

08:09.923 --> 08:13.794
If you can't turn this
into 100 grand,

08:13.827 --> 08:15.228
you're in the wrong game.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.531
So you wanna play
a game with me.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.033
We just did.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.570
You want
what I'm selling or not?

08:22.603 --> 08:24.605
TASTEMAKER:
I'm all in.

08:25.606 --> 08:32.145
*

08:32.179 --> 08:35.115
(punches landing, man grunting)

08:45.392 --> 08:47.294
-He's in.
-Good.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.665
(line trills)

08:51.699 --> 08:54.702
(cell phone ringing)

08:56.970 --> 09:00.407
Devon, we have a problem
in Chicago.

09:00.440 --> 09:04.111
*

09:04.144 --> 09:05.412
(elevator bell dings)

09:05.445 --> 09:07.180
Let's get out of here.

09:07.214 --> 09:14.154
*

09:33.473 --> 09:36.443
(somber music)

09:36.476 --> 09:42.916
*

09:42.950 --> 09:44.517
(chuckles softly)

09:46.654 --> 09:48.288
I forgot your present.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.590
No, you didn't.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.960
-Yes, I did.
-No, you didn't.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.028
(laughs)

10:00.200 --> 10:01.635
I haven't had a tree since--

10:01.669 --> 10:03.303
You will now.

10:04.705 --> 10:05.839
Siempre.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.243
It worked.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.945
We got their attention.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.048
Yeah, I'll bet you did.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.284
(elevator bell dings)

10:17.317 --> 10:18.786
It's pretty.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.620
Yeah, snow's sure nice
to look at,

10:20.654 --> 10:22.690
but I'll tell you,
it's a bitch on the runway.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.360
Maybe we can see some
together someday.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.864
James and Pote are waiting.

10:30.898 --> 10:31.865
Let's go.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.006
TRUESDALE: Gentlemen, this is
day one of our joint task force.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.874
Colonel Cortez's agents
have been briefed

10:40.908 --> 10:43.977
and Governor Vargas
is dealing with the press.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.379
Camila Vargas is in business
with a Bolivian supplier

10:46.413 --> 10:47.681
named El Santo.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.516
If you do not stop her,

10:49.549 --> 10:51.618
there will be more bloodshed.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.054
The Bolivian product
has shown up in Dallas.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.957
And we also made a seizure
tied to a trawler company

10:56.990 --> 10:59.693
we believe Camila owns,
Colibri Transport.

10:59.727 --> 11:01.729
The company's owned
by a shell corporation.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.630
We need papers to prove
Camila's the owner,

11:03.663 --> 11:06.166
but we connect those dots,
we got her dead to rights.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.538
I've been watching
their drop-offs.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.707
Most of 'em come here
every other day

11:13.741 --> 11:15.608
from Devon's jets
for distribution.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.545
They use his hotels
for the other drops.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.513
JAMES: Any change-up
in their schedule?

11:20.547 --> 11:22.115
GUERO: Give or take
15 minutes.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.518
They change up the transpo
to look legit, though.

11:25.552 --> 11:28.321
Laundry trucks,
kitchen supplies.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.523
We just gotta figure out
which one's the right one.

11:30.557 --> 11:31.859
TERESA: And when we do,
make sure

11:31.892 --> 11:32.993
the Tastemaker
doesn't take it.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.095
He agreed to buy from us.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.497
-(indistinct chatter)
-(truck beeping)

11:37.530 --> 11:39.933
GUERO: There it is.
That's our shipment.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.969
And there's Devon's
deliveryman.

11:45.973 --> 11:48.942
(dramatic music)

11:48.976 --> 11:51.779
*

11:51.812 --> 11:54.782
(engine starts)

11:54.815 --> 11:57.284
JAMES: Shit.
The Tastemaker's got cold feet.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.420
He's sticking with
Devon's product, not ours.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.922
-We need to do more.
JAMES: Not yet.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.690
Camila said strike
if necessary.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.759
My life is on the line
with El Santo.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.094
Not yours or Camila.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.198
We must hit the driver now,
block Devon's sale.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.067
(engine starts)

12:14.101 --> 12:17.070
(intense music)

12:17.104 --> 12:23.743
*

12:32.352 --> 12:33.486
He take your dirty laundry?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.088
That's a lot to unload.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.824
Oh, he coming right back.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.491
You gon' see that, bitch.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.293
What I see is you
losing this truck.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.462
You know whose shit
you fucking with, baby girl?

12:45.365 --> 12:46.533
Give me his phone.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.940
Here's our number.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.441
If Devon Finch
doesn't call us

12:54.474 --> 12:55.742
within two hours,

12:55.775 --> 12:56.944
he'll lose more
than this truck.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.511
Call him.

12:58.545 --> 12:59.646
I just can't
call that dude

12:59.679 --> 13:01.281
like that, man.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.816
Shit, you gotta mess me up
a little bit.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.451
Otherwise he'll think
I'm stealing.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.953
But just--just--just--
just a little bit.

13:05.986 --> 13:10.423
-We wouldn't do that.
-Ooh! Ooh!

13:10.457 --> 13:12.425
-Ooh.
-What?

13:12.459 --> 13:15.262
-He asked for it.
-I ain't ask for all that.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.496
(spits)

13:16.529 --> 13:18.298
You knocked my damn tooth out.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.666
You want me to finish them all?

13:19.699 --> 13:21.034
Mm-mm!

13:21.068 --> 13:22.002
TERESA: Call him.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.703
Let's not wait.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.440
Y'all messing with
the wrong motherfucker.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.542
Tell you that goddamn much.

13:30.410 --> 13:33.313
(engine starts)

13:35.582 --> 13:36.783
Call.

13:36.816 --> 13:43.823
*

13:49.162 --> 13:51.831
We took Devon's truck
but still no call.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.000
CAMILA: Go back to the driver.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.834
Pressure him again.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.569
JAMES: He's in the wind.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.305
Look, it's not safe.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.907
We're just targets
at a gun range.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.142
-We need to leave.
-You stay where I say.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.411
JAMES: And give Devon more time
to strike back?

14:04.444 --> 14:06.846
You know, it's not just us
he's gonna come after.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.551
Look, Finch isn't the only
distributor we can work with.

14:15.788 --> 14:19.026
No, but he's the one I want.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.794
Put Teresa on the phone.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.940
Yeah.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.943
CAMILA: Theresa...
(speaking Spanish)

14:41.048 --> 14:42.449
Not yet.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.684
We took his product.
He'll come to us.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.754
I'm gonna go get a drink.
Pote, let's go.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.963
(door opens)

14:57.464 --> 14:58.865
(door closes)

14:58.898 --> 15:02.302
SÃ­.
(speaking Spanish)

15:11.144 --> 15:14.114
(dramatic music)

15:14.147 --> 15:15.248
*

15:16.249 --> 15:17.917
PROFESSOR:
I have Chicago handled.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.590
If you had it handled,
you wouldn't be here, Professor.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.459
Makes me feel like
someone else has the keys

15:26.493 --> 15:28.595
to the house I built
and locked me the hell out.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.131
You know
I don't ring doorbells.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.000
I kick the shit in for you.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.434
You ever known me
to let people

15:34.467 --> 15:36.636
put you out in the cold
like that?

15:36.669 --> 15:39.506
Especially with start-up dealers
like these?

15:39.539 --> 15:41.174
Start-ups bring down empires.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.079
What do they have to offer?

15:46.113 --> 15:47.947
Bolivian coke.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.819
Hmm. Purity?

15:54.221 --> 15:55.322
98%.

15:57.724 --> 15:58.891
(chuckles softly)

16:04.064 --> 16:05.898
This ends now.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.509
(chuckles softly)

16:19.512 --> 16:21.048
Did you pay for it
or steal it?

16:21.081 --> 16:22.815
(chuckles softly)

16:22.849 --> 16:24.784
Well, paying isn't
that much fun.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.720
What do you expect
in return?

16:31.091 --> 16:33.226
I wanna give you
what you want.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.133
Life doesn't care
about what you want.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.435
We don't get to choose.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.772
You can choose now.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.876
Chicago's a long way
from Dallas.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.880
I just wanna be together.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.450
No matter what.

17:01.188 --> 17:04.157
(gentle music)

17:04.191 --> 17:10.863
*

17:41.994 --> 17:43.930
And the chem test
is positive?

17:45.332 --> 17:47.700
You're sure it's
the same product?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.502
The Astrom Hotel?

17:54.006 --> 17:56.209
We just caught a break
in Chicago.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.278
A broker was arrested
with the same Bolivian cocaine

17:58.311 --> 17:59.646
we found in Dallas.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.947
Says he bought it at a hotel.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.149
The dealer
could still be there.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.883
Then get to Chicago,
but take

18:03.916 --> 18:05.618
Colonel Cortez
with you.

18:07.487 --> 18:08.588
Yes, ma'am.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.826
(both speaking Spanish)

18:28.875 --> 18:30.277
You show him, Colonel.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.480
(cell phone vibrating)

18:33.513 --> 18:34.681
Excuse me.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.284
CAMILA: To assure a job
is carried out,

18:37.317 --> 18:39.986
you must do it yourself,
but you should know that.

18:40.019 --> 18:42.121
This task force
is not a personal vendetta.

18:42.155 --> 18:43.656
I'm here in Dallas

18:43.690 --> 18:45.358
as a concerned politician
and nothing more.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.794
Oh, please. Save your
bullshit for the cameras.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.763
The sicario you sent to Dallas
nearly killed me.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.865
What? When did
this attack occur?

18:52.899 --> 18:54.934
Oh, please, Epifanio.
At least be man enough

18:54.967 --> 18:56.769
to recognize what you've done.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.105
It's the truth. I will gladly
kill your business,

18:59.138 --> 19:02.809
-but not you.
-Well, if it wasn't you,

19:02.842 --> 19:05.044
then look
at your puppet Cortez.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.847
If you can't control your dog,
it's best to put him on a leash

19:07.880 --> 19:12.219
-or put him down.
-A wife gives ultimatums.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.221
You lost your right
when you divorced me.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.289
You wanna talk about rights?

19:16.323 --> 19:18.791
Fine, Sinaloa has the right
to know who you are.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.993
Isabela has the right
to know about your hypocrisy.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.129
And I have the right to tell you
that I should have

19:23.162 --> 19:25.565
listened to my father when he
told me not to marry you.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.534
And your lies may work
in voting booths

19:27.567 --> 19:29.569
and flashy press conferences...

19:29.602 --> 19:31.238
(Epifanio groans)

19:31.271 --> 19:33.340
Aah!

19:35.342 --> 19:36.276
Epifanio?

19:37.244 --> 19:39.212
-Call 911!
-Yes, sir!

19:39.246 --> 19:40.813
(speaking Spanish)

19:40.847 --> 19:44.217
(tense music)

19:48.855 --> 19:53.760
All right, so we get those
Chilean passports George gave us

19:53.793 --> 19:55.094
and then we get across
the Mexican border

19:55.127 --> 19:56.396
and we grab Tony.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.265
And then I got
enough connections

19:58.298 --> 19:59.699
to fly us out of there.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.768
Mexico's too dangerous for us.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.938
Well, hell, anywhere
can be too dangerous.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.443
Anyway,
we won't be there long.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.746
Spain.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.348
(chuckles softly)

20:15.382 --> 20:16.716
Marbella.

20:19.386 --> 20:22.622
We're gonna have
to live small.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.891
You know,
lie low for a little bit.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.794
"Drink cold sangrias
and make love in the sand."

20:27.827 --> 20:29.962
(speaks Spanish)

20:29.996 --> 20:32.665
I want that.
I'm ready.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.270
We have to go.

20:39.439 --> 20:42.742
Now. Before James and Pote
find out we're gone.

20:44.143 --> 20:50.650
*

21:00.427 --> 21:04.297
(music intensifies)

21:04.331 --> 21:09.936
*

21:13.973 --> 21:17.510
What made you think
you could come to Chicago

21:17.544 --> 21:19.846
and screw with Devon's game?

21:19.879 --> 21:21.748
Screw with my game?

21:21.781 --> 21:23.483
We just want to make
a deal with him.

21:23.516 --> 21:27.354
So you crash his party
and hijack his delivery.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.891
Tell James and Pote
to come to your room.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.060
Now.

21:36.062 --> 21:39.098
(tense music)

21:39.131 --> 21:43.169
*

21:43.202 --> 21:46.506
-(phone dialing)
-(line trills)

21:46.539 --> 21:48.475
JAMES: I was just heading there.
What's up?

21:48.508 --> 21:51.010
Come to my room.
Bring Pote.

21:53.646 --> 21:56.248
You two planning
a trip somewhere?

21:57.484 --> 21:59.386
Just heading back to Dallas.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.020
(room lock beeps)

22:01.053 --> 22:02.254
(door opens)

22:03.723 --> 22:05.492
PROFESSOR: Join the party.

22:05.525 --> 22:12.264
*

22:15.535 --> 22:18.337
PROFESSOR:
You have three hours.

22:18.371 --> 22:19.639
For what?

22:19.672 --> 22:20.707
PROFESSOR: You came to Chicago

22:20.740 --> 22:22.509
for a reason, didn't you?

22:22.542 --> 22:23.910
To meet Devon.

22:24.611 --> 22:25.912
JAMES: Where are we
gonna meet him?

22:25.945 --> 22:29.181
Palwaukee Airport,
private runway.

22:29.215 --> 22:31.217
There'll be a plane
waiting for you.

22:34.387 --> 22:35.855
How do we know
you won't kill us?

22:38.591 --> 22:40.092
You don't.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.330
*

22:44.363 --> 22:47.366
(indistinct PA announcement)

22:56.943 --> 23:00.346
A real man always knows
his woman's step.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.381
Camila. (chuckles)

23:02.415 --> 23:03.883
EstÃ¡ bien.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.855
Inches from death

23:08.888 --> 23:11.057
and you're still
a charming son of a bitch.

23:11.090 --> 23:15.094
You risked being arrested
by coming here.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.797
And on your birthday,
no less.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.535
A heart attack isn't nothing.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.937
Ah, it's a flea bite.
Mild.

23:24.971 --> 23:29.141
-Leave it in.
-(speaking Spanish)

23:29.175 --> 23:31.478
It's not a good look for me.

23:31.511 --> 23:34.180
No, but living is.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.986
(dramatic music)

23:48.961 --> 23:51.330
When I lost you,

23:51.363 --> 23:53.132
I thought my heart would break.

23:57.203 --> 24:00.006
Perhaps it finally has.

24:00.039 --> 24:07.046
*

24:14.186 --> 24:16.355
JAMES: We've gotta get
to Palwaukee in an hour.

24:16.388 --> 24:18.691
Let's get these bags
down to the garage.

24:30.236 --> 24:33.339
This is one flight
that you're not gonna get on.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.147
That's not really up to you,
my friend.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.381
(chuckles)

24:48.087 --> 24:50.389
Teresa's a strong woman,
now.

24:50.422 --> 24:52.559
Stands on her own.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.794
She's not that little girl
who you left behind

24:54.827 --> 24:57.830
to be raped by Gato.

25:00.199 --> 25:03.169
(breathing heavily)

25:04.270 --> 25:06.238
Pinche puto,
you let that happen?

25:07.607 --> 25:10.409
You let Epi make that call
and you didn't do nothing?

25:11.578 --> 25:12.879
You can blame me.

25:12.912 --> 25:15.514
You can blame Epifanio.

25:17.283 --> 25:20.019
Are you too scared to look
at yourself in the mirror?

25:20.052 --> 25:21.487
Hmm?

25:21.520 --> 25:24.891
You stole from your padrino.

25:24.924 --> 25:27.226
You snitch.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.729
Now you come here
and you wanna tear down

25:29.762 --> 25:31.931
everything that she fought
to rebuild?

25:32.599 --> 25:33.566
Huh?

25:36.435 --> 25:39.071
You walk out of here
and never come back.

25:44.744 --> 25:47.279
(tense music)

25:47.313 --> 25:48.748
James is waiting in the car.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.252
What's wrong?

25:56.823 --> 25:57.924
Nothing.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.394
Come on. Let's go.

26:14.140 --> 26:17.109
(tires squealing)

26:18.244 --> 26:19.779
CORTEZ: That's one
of Camila's men.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.748
ALONZO: Cortez,
put the gun down, now!

26:25.451 --> 26:26.552
We need him alive!

26:26.585 --> 26:29.922
(intense music)

26:29.956 --> 26:36.929
*

27:00.386 --> 27:01.854
(grunts)

27:01.888 --> 27:07.293
*

27:11.363 --> 27:14.333
(monitor beeping,
respirator hissing)

27:22.875 --> 27:24.977
(line trills)

27:25.011 --> 27:28.380
-(indistinct chatter)
-(cell phone vibrating)

27:28.414 --> 27:30.149
Oh!

27:30.182 --> 27:32.151
(upbeat music playing)

27:32.184 --> 27:34.286
(laughs)

27:34.320 --> 27:37.790
*

27:37.824 --> 27:41.027
Hey, Papi, what's up?
Uh, I'm kind of busy right now.

27:41.060 --> 27:44.463
Isabela, it's Mom.
Your father...

27:44.496 --> 27:47.166
What are you doing
with Papi's phone?

27:47.199 --> 27:48.901
Are you two together?

27:48.935 --> 27:50.036
What's going on
in there, Isabela?

27:50.069 --> 27:51.203
Are you having a party?

27:51.237 --> 27:53.572
No. And if I was, so what?

27:53.605 --> 27:55.908
I don't know who of those
idiot little brats

27:55.942 --> 27:57.877
you're hanging out with
told you it's okay

27:57.910 --> 27:59.011
to disrespect your mother,
but you know--

27:59.045 --> 28:00.312
(phone beeps)

28:00.346 --> 28:02.014
(line beeps dead)

28:03.115 --> 28:04.383
She hung up.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.252
Is there a problem
with Isabela?

28:06.285 --> 28:09.588
Yes. She had a father
that lost control of her.

28:09.621 --> 28:11.357
She's home, studying.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.059
She's home
with Kique Jimenez,

28:13.092 --> 28:15.127
and I can assure you,
not one book is open.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.064
You were supposed
to take care of that.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.432
You know, I knew I couldn't

28:20.466 --> 28:22.234
count on you
to be a good husband,

28:22.268 --> 28:23.870
but at least I thought
you would be a good father

28:23.903 --> 28:26.605
-to our daughter.
-What about you?

28:26.638 --> 28:28.607
What mother
abandons her family?

28:28.640 --> 28:30.076
Her little girl?

28:30.109 --> 28:32.711
If she had a mother,
this wouldn't be.

28:32.745 --> 28:35.014
If you are here
to blame someone,

28:35.047 --> 28:36.682
turn the mirror on yourself.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.384
See how long you can stare
at a lie.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.919
Oh, I stared at you
for decades.

28:39.952 --> 28:41.120
Oh, really?

28:43.722 --> 28:45.424
(sighs)

28:46.458 --> 28:50.963
And one last thing,
my love.

28:50.997 --> 28:53.132
Next time your heart stops,

28:53.165 --> 28:56.102
stay on the ground,
where you belong.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.511
(sighs)

29:12.018 --> 29:14.787
(grunting)

29:23.262 --> 29:24.196
Looking for this?

29:30.036 --> 29:31.503
(line trills)

29:31.537 --> 29:34.473
I've got one of them.
Ninth floor.

29:41.380 --> 29:44.350
(dramatic music)

29:44.383 --> 29:51.190
*

29:51.223 --> 29:52.992
Something's wrong.

29:53.025 --> 29:56.528
(line trilling)

29:56.562 --> 29:58.197
James isn't answering.

29:59.999 --> 30:06.638
*

30:10.409 --> 30:13.312
You got Camila's number two?
I'm on my way.

30:15.181 --> 30:16.748
(elevator bell dings)

30:19.251 --> 30:20.252
Feds got him.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.490
POTE: Teresa! Hey!
GUERO: Teresa!

30:34.766 --> 30:37.870
(beeping)

30:39.338 --> 30:41.440
Ninth floor.
Let's go!

30:46.678 --> 30:49.681
You are a good soldier,
Sergeant.

30:49.715 --> 30:52.885
You know how to honor
the chain of command.

30:52.919 --> 30:56.755
Your problem is, you are
under an unstable leader

30:56.788 --> 30:59.225
that doesn't respect
your talent.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.928
Women aren't meant
to be in charge.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.262
What do you want from me?

31:03.295 --> 31:05.164
I can use a man like you.

31:05.197 --> 31:10.336
Under me, you can have
your own region to control.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.038
No more risking your life
for a woman

31:12.071 --> 31:14.473
who doesn't have
the capacity to rise.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.345
Go on, soldier.

31:19.378 --> 31:23.049
Take the weights off your legs.
Hmm?

31:24.984 --> 31:27.353
I will set you free

31:27.386 --> 31:29.956
and make you as powerful
as you were meant to be.

31:31.290 --> 31:32.624
(elevator bell dings)

31:33.892 --> 31:34.860
(grunts)

31:34.893 --> 31:36.795
(intense music)

31:36.828 --> 31:39.966
(grunting)

31:39.999 --> 31:42.734
*

31:42.768 --> 31:45.671
-Aah!
-(grunting)

31:46.472 --> 31:48.074
Thought you were smarter
than that!

31:48.107 --> 31:49.075
(grunts)

31:54.280 --> 31:55.481
That's too bad.

31:57.483 --> 32:00.686
(electricity crackling)

32:03.755 --> 32:05.424
I had better plans for you.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.659
-(grunts)
-(grunting)

32:07.693 --> 32:09.528
Cortez, what are you doing?

32:18.704 --> 32:21.007
You wear that necklace well.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.342
Good.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.311
'Cause it's the only thing
I intend on wearing

32:25.344 --> 32:26.945
for the next few hours.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.616
Ooh, business first.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.684
We have some papers to sign.

32:32.718 --> 32:34.520
-The trawler company.
-Mm.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.855
After the seizure
of Jimenez's product,

32:36.888 --> 32:38.524
the DEA's been sniffing around.

32:38.557 --> 32:41.693
Teo did a good job
of hiding your ownership

32:41.727 --> 32:43.129
in shell corporations.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.131
But that's not
enough protection.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.633
I have a contingency plan.

32:47.666 --> 32:48.900
(chuckles)

32:49.701 --> 32:51.370
Happy birthday, Camila.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.185
(dramatic music)

33:06.218 --> 33:08.320
You did good.

33:08.354 --> 33:09.888
Very good.

33:09.921 --> 33:16.595
*

33:29.007 --> 33:31.243
(sighs)

33:45.224 --> 33:46.725
(sighs)

33:50.362 --> 33:53.365
(all panting)

34:02.074 --> 34:03.342
ALONZO: Colonel,
I'm warning you.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.244
You think you're in Mexico?

34:05.277 --> 34:06.745
Your ass'll get arrested.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.280
You can't get away
with that here.

34:08.314 --> 34:10.048
CORTEZ:
Can't get away with what?

34:10.082 --> 34:11.083
What should we do?

34:14.120 --> 34:16.322
-I'm gonna need y'all's help.
-(groans)

34:17.989 --> 34:19.925
CORTEZ: The cartels don't have
any respect for your rules...

34:19.958 --> 34:24.230
(Cortez continues indistinctly)

34:24.263 --> 34:25.897
(electricity crackling)

34:25.931 --> 34:27.399
CORTEZ: They do not matter
to the cartels.

34:27.433 --> 34:31.303
(Cortez continues indistinctly)

34:31.337 --> 34:32.604
ALONZO:
This is not how we run things.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.306
You wanna end up in jail?

34:34.340 --> 34:35.907
Listen to me, okay?

34:35.941 --> 34:37.643
We're supposed to be
on the same team!

34:37.676 --> 34:39.378
CORTEZ: Back off
and let me do my job!

34:39.411 --> 34:41.547
ALONZO: That's Camila's
number two. We need him!

34:41.580 --> 34:42.781
CORTEZ: That's right, boy,
flesh.

34:42.814 --> 34:44.550
That's him in the flesh

34:44.583 --> 34:46.084
and I'm gonna keep doing it
as much as I want!

34:46.118 --> 34:48.086
ALONZO:
The hell are you doing, man?

34:48.120 --> 34:51.290
-(Cortez laughs)
-(electricity crackling)

34:51.323 --> 34:53.592
Be cool, man.
The DEA don't roll like that!

34:53.625 --> 34:55.093
CORTEZ: I've been fighting
cartels since you were sucking

34:55.127 --> 34:56.928
on your madre's
low-hanging tetas.

34:56.962 --> 34:59.831
Cartels don't care about
our rules and morality,

34:59.865 --> 35:01.633
and neither can we!

35:03.335 --> 35:06.071
-(electricity crackling)
-(speaking Spanish)

35:06.104 --> 35:08.407
There ain't no we. Shock him
again and I'll show you.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.309
Loya!

35:10.342 --> 35:11.877
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.647
You looking for me?

35:20.386 --> 35:23.155
He's just muscle.
He can't give you Camila.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.625
Let him go.
You can have me.

35:27.693 --> 35:29.561
You shot Finnerman
like a fucking animal.

35:30.862 --> 35:33.131
CORTEZ: Does he still deserve
the rule of law?

35:34.065 --> 35:37.135
You can shoot him dead right now
and no one would ever know.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.541
Just cut him loose.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.151
Cut him.

35:53.185 --> 36:00.158
*

36:00.192 --> 36:01.327
CORTEZ: Ah.

36:02.694 --> 36:05.564
(speaking Spanish)

36:10.001 --> 36:11.237
Hey!

36:17.075 --> 36:19.578
Coronel.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.548
Teresa...

36:36.428 --> 36:43.435
*

36:53.211 --> 36:56.282
Teresa, leave the bags.
Here, take your car.

36:56.315 --> 36:58.784
Meet Devon.
We'll get him help.

36:58.817 --> 37:01.787
(intense music)

37:01.820 --> 37:08.827
*

37:28.847 --> 37:29.815
(groans)

37:38.256 --> 37:40.592
CAMILA: Mr. Finch,
I've been expecting your call.

37:40.626 --> 37:43.161
I'll be arriving in two hours.

37:43.194 --> 37:45.864
It'll be my pleasure to sit
and do business with you.

37:47.366 --> 37:49.635
-Good.
KELLY ANNE: Camila!

37:49.668 --> 37:51.403
Where's Cole?

37:51.437 --> 37:53.071
And don't lie to me,
because I know he's up there.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.440
Do I know you?

37:54.473 --> 37:55.607
Yeah.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.175
You know exactly who I am.

37:57.208 --> 37:58.844
And I know
exactly what you are,

37:58.877 --> 38:00.679
which is a drug dealer
and a whore.

38:00.712 --> 38:03.181
And I'm not just gonna stand
here and bat my eyelashes

38:03.214 --> 38:04.983
while you wreck
where I lay my head.

38:09.054 --> 38:12.424
Do you really think your husband
would have an old woman like me

38:12.458 --> 38:15.594
when he can have a young beauty
like yourself?

38:15.627 --> 38:19.665
With all the amount of money
and power your husband has,

38:19.698 --> 38:21.500
he can have any woman
he wants.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.535
What are you doing up there
so late?

38:24.370 --> 38:27.873
My business runs
on a 24-hour clock.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.708
It doesn't stop at 6:00.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.209
And neither does his billing.

38:31.242 --> 38:32.878
Cole Van Awken cares
about his money,

38:32.911 --> 38:35.714
so maybe you can ask him
what our arrangement was.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.115
Now, if you excuse me.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.317
I'm sorry for this
misunderstanding.

38:44.423 --> 38:45.391
Claro.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.832
(dramatic music)

38:53.865 --> 39:00.572
*

39:09.381 --> 39:12.017
Where's James?
Is he okay?

39:12.050 --> 39:13.385
He will be.

39:13.419 --> 39:20.426
*

39:27.132 --> 39:30.235
People don't stay around long
when they mess with my business.

39:30.268 --> 39:33.338
Yet you did it
without any hesitation.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.941
Hesitation is a stutter step.

39:35.974 --> 39:38.343
I needed to take a full one.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.779
I had to force you
to the table somehow.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.416
Well, you wanted my attention,
Ms. Vargas.

39:44.450 --> 39:45.451
Now you have it.

39:51.723 --> 39:58.464
*

40:02.801 --> 40:04.970
If I'm still standing here
when Camila comes out,

40:05.003 --> 40:06.171
I'm a dead man.

40:07.473 --> 40:09.608
And if you're still
standing here--

40:09.641 --> 40:11.910
She will hunt us both.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.814
That's not
what's gonna happen.

40:15.847 --> 40:18.149
I'm leaving,
but I'm gonna leave alone.

40:21.820 --> 40:25.090
There's something I gotta
take care of first...

40:25.123 --> 40:27.325
for both of us.

40:27.358 --> 40:29.327
What?

40:29.360 --> 40:31.630
Look, you just gotta
trust me on this one.

40:32.764 --> 40:36.367
All right?
I gotta do it alone.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.608
And I gotta leave now.

40:44.643 --> 40:46.878
Pote's here for you
till I get back.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.716
You can count on him.

40:53.719 --> 40:54.886
Hey.

41:02.828 --> 41:05.664
I'll be back soon,
all right?

41:06.865 --> 41:08.466
I promise.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.973
(gentle, somber music)

41:15.006 --> 41:22.013
*

41:23.348 --> 41:24.482
I love you.

41:24.516 --> 41:31.523
*
