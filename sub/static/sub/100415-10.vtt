Smells like I'm back on patrol.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.941
PIERCE:
Worse inside.

00:23.983 --> 00:25.651
Yeah? So how's it going?

00:25.693 --> 00:27.486
Been here all night.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.906
Deed was done upstairs,
but no body parts.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.992
Moved the search down here.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.660
Trying to get
some cadaver dogs out.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.078
Two hours.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.289
It's a marathon,
not a sprint, Pierce.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.124
-Where's your partner?
-Inside.

00:40.166 --> 00:43.043
So-- how many squatters?

00:43.085 --> 00:45.045
No way to know. Come and go.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.422
Did you get any of them talking?

00:46.464 --> 00:48.424
What's the incentive?
Transients.

00:48.466 --> 00:50.301
No one's gonna admit
they were in here.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.553
Use your charm, Rondell.

00:52.595 --> 00:54.430
Yes, ma'am.

00:58.601 --> 01:01.228
Coffee for the road?

01:01.270 --> 01:03.272
Sure.

01:06.692 --> 01:09.278
Saturday, I could drive down
with you, uh,

01:09.320 --> 01:10.863
-help you get settled in.
-Dad.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.907
Bring the dog.

01:14.492 --> 01:16.076
Decide on a name yet?

01:16.118 --> 01:18.162
-He's your dog.
-Jesus, Mads,

01:18.204 --> 01:19.497
what are you running away from?

01:21.081 --> 01:23.083
Nothing.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.591
I may have peeked

01:30.633 --> 01:32.843
at a confidential memo
on Tom Galligan's desk.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.223
And sent it to Honey Chandler.

01:41.977 --> 01:45.022
I know it was wrong, but I don't
feel so guilty about it.

01:45.064 --> 01:46.774
You take a job with the D.A.,

01:46.816 --> 01:48.484
you agree to play
by their rules.

01:48.526 --> 01:51.028
-Even if they don't?
-Yep.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.448
-Two kinds of truth.
-Not what I meant.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.200
It's exactly what you meant.

01:59.829 --> 02:01.872
You think Galligan
will drop a dime on you?

02:03.290 --> 02:05.751
I don't know,
but I can't go back there.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.711
I need some space to think.

02:08.754 --> 02:11.048
Get a handle on my life.

02:11.090 --> 02:13.551
I get it.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.931
Let's say we get
your car packed, yeah?

02:18.973 --> 02:21.600
I would love that. Thank you.

Midnight curfew.

you took for me, Mads.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.829

when you get there, okay?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.122
I will.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.084
Drive carefully.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.336

06:40.234 --> 06:42.236
Dark days.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.365
You've never talked to me
about any of this.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.117
They were just stories.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.494
I grew up here.

06:50.536 --> 06:53.789
Never thought
it would cross my path.

06:53.831 --> 06:55.624
You're gonna go after him.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.835
No. He's protected.

06:57.876 --> 07:00.337
How is that possible?

07:00.379 --> 07:03.590
Paramilitary group he created
to overthrow Haiti's president

07:03.632 --> 07:05.134
was funded
by the U.S. government.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.136
(scoffs)

07:07.177 --> 07:09.972
And now he's just walking
around L.A. like it was nothing.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.308
Blind eye to the crimes
back home.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.394
Fresh start.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.313
And the cops?

07:18.355 --> 07:20.274
Can't connect them to any of it.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.942
Bo Jonas can.

07:21.984 --> 07:24.194
He does? He's dead.

07:25.571 --> 07:26.947
You tell Bosch?

07:26.989 --> 07:28.949
Some of it.

07:28.991 --> 07:33.287
Harry got pretty jammed up
with his old case.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.913
Talk to him, J.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.916
I put Gary with these guys.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.668
It's my job to clean it up.

07:39.710 --> 07:42.337
Not by yourself.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.977
Thank you.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.609
What would he tell you to do?

08:09.156 --> 08:11.366
I don't know.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.711
BOSCH:
Anderson.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.546
Detective Bosch.

08:24.588 --> 08:28.008
-Hell of a hatchet job.
-You never returned my calls.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.677
Should've held it back till you
had all the facts, dumbass.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.722
Don't worry,
my editor's up my ass

08:33.764 --> 08:35.474
for a skin back retraction.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.100
Have a nice fucking day.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.061
You got us standing.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.480
My lawyer and I weren't sure
you were gonna bite.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.899
Fuck you.

08:43.941 --> 08:45.901
And her.
She played me for a chump.

08:45.943 --> 08:48.862
So it was Chandler
who tipped you off.

08:48.904 --> 08:49.863
What?

08:49.905 --> 08:52.324
But you have a nice fucking day.

09:01.959 --> 09:05.337
Sorry I'm late, Detective.
Follow me in.

09:13.262 --> 09:15.264
(door closes)

09:19.268 --> 09:21.645
You and Ms. Chandler make
a good team.

09:21.687 --> 09:23.689
This time.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.526
I hope
the district attorney's office

09:27.567 --> 09:29.152
offered you a formal apology.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.196
They did.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.158
Spencer's agreed to cooperate.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.369
Cronyn and Cronyn
are scrambling to make bail.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.874
But you didn't come here
to give me a briefing.

09:52.301 --> 09:56.680
BOSCH:
The before-search photo
missing from archives.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.724
Borders' bedroom.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.521
You ever work cold cases, Chief?

10:04.563 --> 10:07.524
-No.
-You'd know if you had:

10:07.566 --> 10:08.984
the department keeps
its own separate copies

10:09.026 --> 10:10.402
of search warrant packets.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.571
Administrative files.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.197
Year by year.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.241
That's right.

10:18.035 --> 10:20.829
The missing before-search photo

10:20.871 --> 10:23.498
is right there.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.792
Right there.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.714
And there's no pendant hanging
from the bedroom wall

10:30.756 --> 10:33.842
where I found it
a few minutes later.

10:33.884 --> 10:37.179
So someone found it in Borders'
bag when he was detained.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.638
And knew
that he could never prove

10:38.680 --> 10:40.265
it was planted in his apartment

10:40.307 --> 10:43.935
without admitting
he committed the crime.

10:43.977 --> 10:47.356
You are a gifted detective.

10:47.397 --> 10:51.068
There's a line.
A line I don't fucking cross.

10:57.074 --> 10:59.034
(sighs)

10:59.076 --> 11:00.869
What do you want, Bosch?

11:00.911 --> 11:02.287
The truth.

11:21.056 --> 11:23.892
About what?

11:30.232 --> 11:32.192
MANKIEWICZ:
Harry.

11:32.234 --> 11:34.194
You have a, uh,
young gentleman caller.

11:34.236 --> 11:36.238
Parked him in the parlor.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.120
Detective Bosch.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.163
Mr. Galligan.

11:45.205 --> 11:49.000
Uh, Maddie left her Ray-Bans
in my car. I just wanted to...

11:49.042 --> 11:50.460
I'll see she gets them. Thanks.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.464
Could have dropped these
in the mail.

11:54.506 --> 11:57.509
-She snooped my desk.
-I know.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.386
That bother you?

11:59.428 --> 12:02.013
Not as much
as I thought it would.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.934
She, uh...
(chuckles)

12:05.976 --> 12:07.686
she won't return my texts.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.229
So call her.

12:09.271 --> 12:11.064
-You think?
-Novel concept, I know,

12:11.106 --> 12:13.400
using your phone
as an actual phone.

12:13.442 --> 12:15.444
(laughs softly)

12:16.695 --> 12:18.864
I was on the wrong side
of Borders.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.449
That was your job.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.492
I guess.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.745
Maddie never doubted you.

12:32.043 --> 12:34.463
Call her.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.847
So how are we doing on Esquivel?

12:43.889 --> 12:45.974
-About to dive into it.
-All right.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.768
You know, Pierce needs
your counsel.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.647
Talk to me, youngblood.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.066
More body parts.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.485
What'd you find?

12:56.526 --> 12:57.903
Head and hands.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.696
Killer stuffed them
in a wall vent.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.698
A scavenger hunt.

13:01.740 --> 13:05.035
We think the victim was female.
Looks to be Hispanic.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.245
Patrol found bloodstained
clothes in a trash can

13:07.287 --> 13:11.166
-down the street.
-And take a look at this.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.336
Cross.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.795
-Right?
-You reach out to RHD?

13:15.837 --> 13:18.757
-Wanted you to confirm it first.
-Wait, what?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.675
Talk to Espinosa. Conniff can be
a bit of a prick to D1s.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.802
-Why do we need to call them?
-A few weeks back,

13:22.844 --> 13:25.472
-they did a roll call
presentation.
-Creep signed his kill.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.475
He took notes.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.234
What's that?

13:37.275 --> 13:40.403
Jonas bought a handgun
stolen from police custody.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.197
I think it connects
to Gary Wise's murder.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.657
You get to Jonas yourself?

13:43.698 --> 13:45.700
At the church, yeah.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.118
Hey, you've been kind of busy.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.745
You're onto something.

13:48.787 --> 13:51.331
Too early to share.

13:51.373 --> 13:54.709
All right. Here if you need me.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.217
(keyboard clicking)

14:07.347 --> 14:09.391
Three Ls in "allegedly."

14:09.432 --> 14:12.060
-BARREL: No shit?
-Mm-hmm.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.813
-You guys heading out soon?
-Why do you ask?

14:14.854 --> 14:17.941
Because I could use a drink
and company.

14:17.983 --> 14:20.777
Double feature
at the New Beverly, L.T.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.362
Yojimbo and Fistful of Dollars.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.698
CRATE:
Red Harvest adaptations.

14:24.739 --> 14:27.659
Unofficially
and only upon close examination.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.828
I'm buying.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.788
Oh?

14:31.830 --> 14:34.040
Hammett, Continental Op.

14:34.082 --> 14:38.295
Leone, Eastwood,
the Man with No Name.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.171
-(exhales)
-You know why?

14:40.213 --> 14:42.048
No. Why?

14:42.090 --> 14:44.843
So we could fill it in
ourselves.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.469
Ha, ha.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.140
-CROWD: Surprise!
-(cheering, applause)

14:50.181 --> 14:52.892
Oh, fuck.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.855
(whooping)

14:56.896 --> 14:58.898
(indistinct chatter)

15:00.525 --> 15:02.360
-Don't ever do this to me.
-Fuck that.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.321
-I can't make any promises
like that.
-(chuckles)

15:04.362 --> 15:05.697
Congratulations, buddy.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.824
Thank you, thank you.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.326
Oh!

15:10.368 --> 15:12.996
Thanks.

32:37.331 --> 32:40.167
Thank you, Chief.

32:40.209 --> 32:42.127
Lieutenant.

33:10.322 --> 33:13.367
You again.

33:13.409 --> 33:15.035
Here to arrest me now?

33:17.079 --> 33:19.039
Here to take you back
to Charlie Company.

33:19.081 --> 33:20.332
Mm.

33:21.375 --> 33:23.877
Some other time.

33:23.919 --> 33:25.546
Thanks, anyway.

33:28.215 --> 33:30.801
Clinic's shuttered.

33:30.843 --> 33:34.805
Hansen and Degner
are facing charges, so...

33:34.847 --> 33:36.265
where you gonna go?

33:42.771 --> 33:44.189
You think you can save me.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.944
You think you're the only one
that's ever tried.

33:48.986 --> 33:51.822
I'm sure I'm not.

33:51.864 --> 33:54.283
What do you know, Harry Bosch?

33:56.452 --> 33:59.037
Tell me all about
what you think is best.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.335
How this life
is slowly killing me.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.379
Burning both ends.

34:09.381 --> 34:10.591
Fuck you.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.678
I can't be saved.

34:14.720 --> 34:17.556
I don't want to be saved.

34:17.598 --> 34:21.226
What do you think your daughter
would want for you?

34:21.268 --> 34:23.020
Stop.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.063
(chuckles)

34:28.942 --> 34:30.527
Just give it a chance,
Elizabeth.

34:30.569 --> 34:34.198
Where the fuck were you
when she disappeared?

34:39.995 --> 34:42.206
(sniffs)

34:44.666 --> 34:46.043
Where you gonna go?

34:46.084 --> 34:48.086
This is it.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.091
Fuck.

34:54.134 --> 34:56.804
You're right.

35:01.683 --> 35:04.061
Didn't know what we had.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.104
Could've been body snatching.

35:08.065 --> 35:09.608
Postmortem.

35:09.650 --> 35:11.735
Not a defensive wound.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.779
Right. Copy that.

35:13.821 --> 35:15.823
Will do.

35:17.491 --> 35:19.076
They don't see
a clear connection.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.328
Okay.

35:21.370 --> 35:22.830
They want us to send
our murder book

35:22.871 --> 35:25.791
and transfer investigative
authority to RHD.

35:25.833 --> 35:27.918
(scoffs)
Why?

35:27.960 --> 35:29.711
-If it's separate crimes.
-Regardless.

35:29.753 --> 35:30.921
So, what'd they say?

35:30.963 --> 35:32.130
That we should've contacted them

35:32.172 --> 35:33.590
as soon as we found
the suitcase.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.050
Yeah, well.

35:35.092 --> 35:36.093
Why can't we keep working ours?

35:36.134 --> 35:38.011
-Share what we get.
-It's not my call.

35:38.053 --> 35:39.513
(scoffs)

35:39.555 --> 35:40.681
Let me talk to Captain Garwood.

35:40.722 --> 35:42.266
Oh, fuck them.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.476
We'll clear our case and theirs.

35:45.519 --> 35:47.771
Is she still hungover?

35:47.813 --> 35:50.148
She's kind of always this way.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.783
Chief?

35:59.825 --> 36:01.618
It's time.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.662
Thank you, Ida.

36:15.716 --> 36:18.385
Ready for the gauntlet?

36:18.427 --> 36:20.429
(door closes)

36:23.098 --> 36:25.100
(journalists murmuring)

36:30.188 --> 36:32.190
(door closes)

36:33.942 --> 36:35.861
I will keep this...

36:35.903 --> 36:37.905
mercifully short.

36:38.947 --> 36:41.325
Now, as you all know,

36:41.366 --> 36:45.162
I cut my teeth patrolling
the streets of this great city.

36:45.203 --> 36:48.040
A cop is who I am,
who I always will be.

36:50.292 --> 36:52.669
But I witnessed firsthand

36:52.711 --> 36:55.923
the struggles
that everyday Angelenos face.

36:55.964 --> 36:59.051
And I've watched over the years
our leadership flounder

36:59.092 --> 37:01.178
with its promises
left unfulfilled.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.515
Now, I recognize
that there's a certain

37:05.557 --> 37:07.768
audacity to this announcement,

37:07.809 --> 37:10.395
as my tenure as chief
has not been long.

37:12.564 --> 37:16.026
But I stand before you today...

37:16.068 --> 37:19.863
to announce that I am exploring
a run for mayor of Los Angeles.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.156
(journalists murmuring)

37:21.198 --> 37:22.991
And, together,
I hope that we can work

37:23.033 --> 37:25.744
to address what I know

37:25.786 --> 37:30.207
and have an open dialogue...
about what I don't.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.625
Thank you.

37:31.667 --> 37:33.335
Now that you've been a client,

37:33.377 --> 37:35.045
I'm gonna have
to turn down cases

37:35.087 --> 37:36.588
where you're lead detective.

37:36.630 --> 37:37.965
Tragic.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.425
I'm gonna miss our dance.

37:40.467 --> 37:42.260
Maybe Maddie could come
intern with me.

37:42.302 --> 37:44.304
See how the other half lives.

37:45.347 --> 37:47.015
Excuse me.

37:47.057 --> 37:48.934
Martinis? We're celebrating.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.021
Jameson's neat, please.

37:53.063 --> 37:54.439
Make it two.

37:56.608 --> 37:57.859
(clears throat)

38:04.908 --> 38:07.202
Bosch, if you have something
to say to me, spit it out.

38:10.163 --> 38:11.665
Your bluff about Spencer.

38:11.707 --> 38:13.625
We won the case and you're
questioning my strategy?

38:13.667 --> 38:16.753
You were walking the high wire
with my career and reputation.

38:18.255 --> 38:19.548
That's not what's bugging you.

38:20.590 --> 38:22.384
Scott Anderson.

38:22.426 --> 38:24.428
He has some walking back to do.

38:24.469 --> 38:26.888
You were his source.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.435
I was.

38:31.476 --> 38:34.896
And Honorable Judge Sobel
let us in over the objections

38:34.938 --> 38:36.606
of everybody in that courtroom.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.233
That story almost got me killed.

38:39.276 --> 38:41.528
I'm sorry about that,
I truly am.

38:43.113 --> 38:45.073
I did what you hired me for.

38:45.115 --> 38:47.075
Borders is going back
to San Quentin

38:47.117 --> 38:49.411
for the rest
of his sorry existence,

38:49.453 --> 38:52.080
and every one of those bastards
who tried to set you up

38:52.122 --> 38:53.498
and frame you is gonna end up

38:53.540 --> 38:55.417
disbarred, fired,
and probably in jail.

38:55.459 --> 38:57.919
Yeah, but I'm the client.

38:57.961 --> 38:59.796
You should have told me
what you were planning.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.089
I tried.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.052
You're like a feral cat;
you don't trust anyone.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.845
You take too many risks.

39:06.887 --> 39:09.598
Says the cop who went
to the desert without backup.

39:12.851 --> 39:16.438
If I had asked, would you
have told me not to do it?

39:20.650 --> 39:22.986
We're cut from the same stone,
you and I.

39:25.238 --> 39:26.364
We do what we have to.

39:31.828 --> 39:33.080
Thank you.

39:37.250 --> 39:39.127
To justice and redemption.

39:39.169 --> 39:42.380
To truth and where it takes us.

39:44.216 --> 39:46.468
(indistinct chatter)

40:00.273 --> 40:02.359
J. Edgar.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.819
Your D3 said I'd find you here.

40:03.860 --> 40:05.529
Conducting the debrief.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.197
(chuckles)

40:10.158 --> 40:11.868
Couldn't just call us?

40:11.910 --> 40:13.453
Follow up on Gary Wise.

40:13.495 --> 40:15.080
I figured it best
to do in person.

40:15.122 --> 40:17.749
Still crickets on our end, man.

40:17.791 --> 40:19.126
You got something?

40:19.167 --> 40:21.336
Maybe.

40:21.378 --> 40:23.713
Gary was holding a gun
for Bo Jonas.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.966
Gangsters who sold it to Jonas
could be Gary's killers.

40:27.008 --> 40:28.468
What makes you say that?

40:28.510 --> 40:30.512
Well, the weapon was stolen
from police custody.

40:30.554 --> 40:33.723
Some of them got recovered
from a raid last year.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.433
Oh.

40:35.475 --> 40:37.310
-Rollin' 60s thing.
-Yeah.

40:37.352 --> 40:38.728
You were at West Bureau then.

40:38.770 --> 40:42.023
Homicide, not Narcotics.

40:42.065 --> 40:44.151
Jonas and Gary go to your meet,

40:44.192 --> 40:45.861
see the gangsters
sold him the gun.

40:45.902 --> 40:46.862
Jonas ran.

40:46.903 --> 40:48.363
You talked to Jonas?

40:48.405 --> 40:49.781
I did.

40:49.823 --> 40:50.991
Where is he?

40:51.032 --> 40:52.826
He's got nothing
on your drive-by.

40:52.868 --> 40:55.120
How do we know he didn't pull
the trigger on Gary Wise?

40:55.162 --> 40:56.663
He said he didn't.
I believe him.

40:58.248 --> 41:00.584
Stolen weapons had to be
an inside job.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.962
Whoever did it...

41:04.004 --> 41:05.672
they're worried about exposure.

41:05.714 --> 41:07.549
Guns in the wrong hands.

41:10.260 --> 41:11.928
Word goes out on the street,
clean it up.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.347
You got nothing but a theory.

41:14.389 --> 41:16.516
I know.

41:16.558 --> 41:18.101
Dirty cops.

41:18.143 --> 41:19.644
(exhales)
Looks like.

41:19.686 --> 41:22.731
Jesus. Who?

41:29.863 --> 41:33.116
(sighs)

41:33.158 --> 41:35.076
You should really
let this go, Jerry.

41:35.118 --> 41:36.953
I don't think I can.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.538
Nobody's gonna protect you.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.128
You're gonna be looking
over your shoulder

41:45.170 --> 41:47.464
-for the rest of your career.
-So will they.

41:50.550 --> 41:53.428
Listen, you hear anything...

41:53.470 --> 41:55.597
Yeah. Absolutely.

41:55.639 --> 41:57.265
-Mm-hmm.
-We'll let you know.

41:57.307 --> 41:58.725
-Appreciate it.
-Uh-huh.

42:01.478 --> 42:02.729
Stay safe, Jerry.

42:04.940 --> 42:07.025
Stay safe.

42:08.068 --> 42:10.070
(siren wailing in distance)

42:30.507 --> 42:32.509
(engine starts)

42:33.969 --> 42:35.971
(grunts)

42:44.229 --> 42:46.231
(phone ringing)

42:53.530 --> 42:55.156
Hi.

42:55.198 --> 42:56.700
Have you put up flyers
for the dog?

42:56.741 --> 42:58.868
BOSCH:
Not yet.
How'd you know the dog was gone?

42:58.910 --> 43:00.954
I have my sources. You probably
don't have a picture.

43:00.996 --> 43:02.372
I'll send you one.

43:02.414 --> 43:04.332
Okay.

43:04.374 --> 43:08.003
Were you gonna tell me someone
tried to kill you in our house?

43:10.046 --> 43:11.756
Department kept my name
out of it.

43:11.798 --> 43:13.008
Didn't want to worry you, Mads.

43:13.049 --> 43:14.634
It was that bad?

43:16.636 --> 43:18.221
My friends knew before I did.

43:18.263 --> 43:20.223
-Internet.
-Sorry.

43:20.265 --> 43:23.018
I know, but...

43:23.059 --> 43:24.352
You're okay?

43:25.395 --> 43:27.564
Yeah, yeah. Fine.

43:27.605 --> 43:28.857
Glad you called.

43:28.898 --> 43:30.567
Me, too.

43:31.943 --> 43:34.029
So, did you get into
that psych class you wanted?

43:34.070 --> 43:36.156
Dad, you can tell me things,
bad things.

43:36.197 --> 43:37.449
I won't freak out.

43:37.490 --> 43:38.950
It's worse not knowing

43:38.992 --> 43:41.411
and then having it
crash down on you online.

43:41.453 --> 43:42.662
Fair enough.

43:42.704 --> 43:44.956
But same goes for you, with me.

43:44.998 --> 43:46.499
Is that another rule?

43:46.541 --> 43:48.460
No, wish list.

43:48.501 --> 43:51.421
I'll think about it.

43:51.463 --> 43:53.590
And I'll do the flyers
next weekend

43:53.631 --> 43:55.717
-if he still hasn't come back.
-You're coming up?

43:55.759 --> 43:58.011
Friday, if that's all right.

43:58.053 --> 43:59.596
Of course it's all right.

43:59.637 --> 44:02.807
This is your home, Madeline.

44:02.849 --> 44:04.976
Maybe carve out
a little time for your old man?

44:05.018 --> 44:07.645
You were doing so well
there for a minute.

44:07.687 --> 44:09.898
(chuckles softly)
Had to ask.

44:09.939 --> 44:11.858
I guess.

44:11.900 --> 44:13.193
I love you, Dad.

44:13.234 --> 44:15.236
Love you, too. So very much.
