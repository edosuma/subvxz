01:57.600 --> 01:59.500
Marcus.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.400
How are you?

02:08.699 --> 02:10.800
Ask me in an hour.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.900
I thought I'd try...

02:16.100 --> 02:18.100
one last time.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.100
You should have stayed in
San Francisco, Dr. Kogan.

02:24.300 --> 02:26.100
By signing this consent form...

02:26.300 --> 02:30.300
you'd be donating your
body to a noble cause.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.100
You'd...

02:32.600 --> 02:38.500
have a second chance, through
my research, to live again.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.900
You know what I did.

02:41.100 --> 02:44.600
My brother and two cops
are dead because of me.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.000
I'm not looking for a second chance.

02:52.300 --> 02:55.700
But I'm not the only one
with a death sentence, am I?

02:58.200 --> 03:01.000
Do you think I'm gonna
cure your cancer, Serena?

03:02.800 --> 03:05.800
I'm not worried about myself.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.800
I'm worried about the
future of the human race.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.500
I'll sell it to you.

03:14.700 --> 03:15.800
For what?

03:16.700 --> 03:17.900
A kiss.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.200
Mm.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.000
Oh...

03:35.100 --> 03:36.800
So that's what death tastes like.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.800
You're doing something very noble.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.600
No, I'm guilty.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.800
Just cut me up until
there's nothing left.

04:06.500 --> 04:10.600
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death...

04:11.200 --> 04:15.500
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.899
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.800
Do you have any last words?

06:09.600 --> 06:11.400
Vanguard, this is Blackjack 6.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.100
Missile inbound to Skynet target.

06:13.300 --> 06:16.500
TTO 11 seconds. Danger close.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.500
- Move! Move!
- Let's go, let's go! Move it!

07:04.900 --> 07:07.400
Connor is on the ground.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.400
This mission is a
quick in-and-out.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.100
Command deems the information
on those computers...

07:15.300 --> 07:17.000
to be of the highest priority.

07:49.700 --> 07:52.100
Connor, there's no sign of the machines.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.300
They're gone.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.800
It's way too quiet.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.900
It's almost like they're waiting for us.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.900
It's down, it's down.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.000
What the hell's that smell, man?

08:32.200 --> 08:33.400
Ugh.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.700
You seeing this?

08:58.300 --> 09:01.900
Olsen. Objective located.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.800
There's something else you have to see.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.000
- Hard wall.
- Get what we came for, Barbarosa.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.400
The clock's ticking.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.600
Spread out, secure the perimeter.
I got a big gap over here.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.800
Why didn't we know about this?

09:33.200 --> 09:34.900
Sir, I think this is what
Command's looking for.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.800
I'm in their source code.

09:36.900 --> 09:39.200
These people are being
taken to San Francisco.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.000
Some sort of R and D
project for a new Terminator.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.000
Send it to Command.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.500
It's uploading. I need two minutes.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.900
Wait, wait, wait. Go back. Go back.

09:48.400 --> 09:49.700
Stop.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.700
- T-800. 
- A new Terminator.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
It's like you said it would be.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.800
- It's worse.
- Get your nose out of that.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.600
None of your business. You're
not leading this mission.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.800
Let's cut these sorry bastards
loose. Come on. Let's go.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.100
- Jericho, come in.
- Watch that.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.800
Come in, Jericho.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.500
Connor, get your ass
topside. Remind those men...

10:16.700 --> 10:20.000
they need to answer me on
the radio, even if they're dead.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.200
Connor!

10:33.300 --> 10:35.000
Connor, get those men to respond.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.100
Olsen, something's wrong up here.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.600
Topside, come in.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.800
Outbound enemy aircraft. I'm in pursuit.

10:58.300 --> 11:01.900
There's human prisoners aboard
that thing. Get after it!

11:18.400 --> 11:20.000
Data transfer complete.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.800
Connor, we're
joining you topsi-

12:04.700 --> 12:06.400
Olsen.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.800
Bravo 10, Bravo 10, do you copy? Over.

13:11.100 --> 13:14.700
Eagle 1 to Bravo 10. Bravo
10, do you copy? Over.

13:17.800 --> 13:21.100
Bravo 10. Bravo 10. Do you copy? Over?

13:24.100 --> 13:25.300
Here.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.600
Bravo 10, identify. Over.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.800
Connor.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.500
We'll send units to
the extraction point.

13:31.700 --> 13:33.900
How many survivors are on-site? Over.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.700
One.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.300
Copy.

14:43.900 --> 14:45.900
Return to base, sir?

14:46.600 --> 14:48.900
- RTB?
- Negative.

14:49.100 --> 14:51.700
- Take me to Command.
- Sir?

14:53.100 --> 14:55.100
Command.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.700
Roger. Rerouting.

15:16.100 --> 15:17.200
Request has been denied.

15:17.400 --> 15:20.700
Command doesn't wanna give up
their position. Radio comms only.

15:20.900 --> 15:24.100
- Are they down there?
- Request has been denied, sir.

15:24.300 --> 15:27.300
Need-to-know only. That's
straight from the top.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.800
You open up that ramp...

15:31.900 --> 15:37.900
and you tell them I need
divers for a lock-in! Now!

15:40.300 --> 15:42.000
This is crazy.

16:09.900 --> 16:11.300
John Connor.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.900
Prophesized leader of the Resistance.

16:14.100 --> 16:17.100
Soldier, you put every man and
woman in this sub in jeopardy...

16:17.300 --> 16:19.600
with your little frogman stunt.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.700
Let's get one thing straight.

16:23.700 --> 16:26.300
I don't believe in prophecy.

16:27.700 --> 16:32.300
Not when one can rewrite
the future in a heartbeat.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.000
Are we on the same page?

16:37.700 --> 16:41.600
Yeah, we're on the same page.

16:43.900 --> 16:48.100
Good. Good.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.500
So, soldier...

16:51.700 --> 16:53.600
what the hell are you doing here?

16:53.800 --> 16:56.500
- What did we find down there?
- You'll be briefed...

16:56.600 --> 16:59.100
- on a need-to-know basis. 
- Well, I need to know.

16:59.300 --> 17:02.300
Because my men 
died down in that hole.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.200
What did we find down there?

17:04.300 --> 17:10.500
We found a solution, Connor, that
can end this war once and for all.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.200
We know the machines use shortwave
transmitters to communicate.

17:17.400 --> 17:21.700
Intel has located a hidden
signal under the primary channel.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.500
It allows for direct
control of the machines.

17:25.599 --> 17:28.099
Skynet's a machine,
and like all machines...

17:28.200 --> 17:30.600
it has an off switch.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.500
Does it work?

17:32.700 --> 17:37.300
Will it work? Yes. Have
we field tested it? No.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.200
Give it to me.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.200
I'll do it.

17:42.900 --> 17:44.700
I'll test it.

17:47.100 --> 17:50.700
Connor and his tech-comm
unit have an excellent record.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.400
All right.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.700
All right. Huh.

17:56.300 --> 18:00.200
Take, Connor topside.
Prepare for lockout.

18:04.200 --> 18:07.600
Connor, we do this
right, the war is over.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.600
We mount our offensive in four days.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.700
Connor.

18:17.500 --> 18:20.200
These are the codes for the signal.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.500
- Good luck.
- Why four days?

18:23.700 --> 18:26.200
A kill list was 
intercepted from, Skynet.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.700
It says everyone in this room
will be dead by week's end.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.400
You're number two on the list.

18:33.500 --> 18:39.300
- Well, who's number one?
- An unknown. A civilian. Kyle Reese.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.500
Jericho. come in.

19:12.700 --> 19:14.300
Come in, Jericho.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.800
Barnes.

19:23.900 --> 19:26.400
My brother, he didn't make it, did he?

20:15.600 --> 20:19.700
This is tape number 28 of
Sarah Connor to my son, John.

20:19.900 --> 20:22.000
What's most difficult for
me is trying to decide...

20:22.100 --> 20:24.600
what to tell you and what not to.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.700
Should I tell you about your father?

20:26.800 --> 20:30.700
Will it affect your decision to
send him back in time to protect me...

20:30.900 --> 20:33.000
knowing that he is your father?

20:33.100 --> 20:36.300
And he'll be younger than you.
Only a teenager when you meet him.

20:36.500 --> 20:39.200
God, a person could go
crazy thinking about this.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
But if you don't send
Kyle, you can never be...

20:43.200 --> 20:45.800
and Skynet will win the war.

20:49.700 --> 20:51.100
You want to talk about him?

20:53.400 --> 20:58.200
Kyle is out there somewhere
alone, and Skynet is hunting him.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.900
What about the signal?

21:01.900 --> 21:03.700
What do you think?

21:12.400 --> 21:14.900
- If it works, it's incredible.
- Yeah.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.400
- We have to be careful.
- I agree.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.700
- But we have to try.
- Okay.

21:21.200 --> 21:24.700
All right, start with something
small that we're familiar with.

21:27.700 --> 21:31.100
We should capture a Hydrobot,
bring it in for testing.

21:31.300 --> 21:32.400
Yeah.

21:33.900 --> 21:35.600
What is it, John?

21:38.100 --> 21:42.200
Kill Kyle Reese, reset the future...

21:42.800 --> 21:44.700
No, John Connor.

22:24.300 --> 22:25.900
Hey!

23:08.400 --> 23:10.200
Come with me if you wanna live.

24:15.100 --> 24:16.400
What is that?

24:17.800 --> 24:19.700
She doesn't talk, but you need to start.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.100
Where'd you get that jacket?

24:23.200 --> 24:24.800
- The other guy didn't need it.
- Oh?

24:26.100 --> 24:27.600
You see that red?

24:27.800 --> 24:30.600
It stands for blood. It's
a symbol of the Resistance.

24:30.800 --> 24:35.000
You're obviously not a Resistance
fighter, so take it off.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.400
Take it off!

24:38.400 --> 24:39.900
You point a gun at someone...

24:40.100 --> 24:42.700
you'd better be ready
to pull the trigger.

24:46.700 --> 24:48.900
Now, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

24:50.500 --> 24:53.200
- What the hell was that thing?
- Terminator.

24:53.400 --> 24:54.600
T-600.

24:58.900 --> 25:00.600
What day is it?

25:01.800 --> 25:03.500
What year?

25:05.700 --> 25:07.600
2018.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.900
What happened here?

25:14.300 --> 25:16.500
Judgement Day happened.

25:20.100 --> 25:22.100
I gotta get out of here.

25:22.300 --> 25:25.400
You can't go on foot. The
machines will cut you down.

25:25.500 --> 25:27.300
You need speed.

25:27.500 --> 25:28.700
I need a car.

25:28.900 --> 25:31.800
Well, look, there's some
by Griffith Observatory.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.900
- They don't run though.
- Take me.

25:35.900 --> 25:37.000
Get down!

26:06.600 --> 26:08.900
That was a Hunter-Killer.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.600
Thanks to you, they know we're here.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.800
What's your name, kid?

26:17.600 --> 26:19.300
Kyle Reese.

26:23.100 --> 26:24.600
Come on.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.400
We burned out his transmitter so
it can't talk to any of its pals.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.800
But he can still receive.

26:32.900 --> 26:34.600
Turn it on.

26:36.500 --> 26:38.100
You got it?

26:38.200 --> 26:39.900
Hold it down, hold it down.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.700
Turn the signal up.

26:54.700 --> 26:55.900
Give me the strap.

26:56.800 --> 26:59.100
- Holy shit.
- Do you believe it?

27:00.000 --> 27:03.100
- All right. Strap it tight.
- The signal has to be continuous.

27:03.300 --> 27:05.100
If there's any interruption...

27:10.000 --> 27:11.500
Okay.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.900
Let's rig up a portable shortwave, test
it on something larger in the field.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.200
All right.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.700
Destroy this thing.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.800
So where are the cars?

27:35.900 --> 27:38.000
You don't wanna go out after dark.

27:38.200 --> 27:42.300
Hunter-Killers have infrared,
hunt better at night.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.800
We'll all go tomorrow morning.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.400
- What is that? 
- Two-day-old coyote.

27:54.400 --> 27:57.300
Better than
three-day-old coyote.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.500
Hey, hey!

28:08.600 --> 28:09.700
Shhh.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.700
- Grab it.
- What?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.400
Grab it.

28:27.500 --> 28:28.500
Magic.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.700
- Got it?
- Yeah.

28:37.200 --> 28:38.400
Thanks.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.700
Does this radio work?

28:44.900 --> 28:46.800
No.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.900
My dad tried to fix it, but
he could never get it to work.

29:07.900 --> 29:09.200
Hold that.

29:14.800 --> 29:15.900
Where is everybody?

29:16.900 --> 29:18.300
They're gone.

29:19.400 --> 29:20.800
So why are you still here?

29:20.900 --> 29:23.900
Because we're the
Resistance, L.A. branch.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.300
Welcome to the headquarters.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.200
Resisting what?

29:30.300 --> 29:32.900
Machines. Skynet.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.900
- Just the two of you?
- Yeah.

29:37.800 --> 29:40.000
How come you're not
wearing one of these?

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
Because I haven't earned mine yet.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.900
I hope he's listening to this.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.200
We've been fighting a long time...

30:00.400 --> 30:04.900
and we have all lost so very
much, so many loved ones gone.

30:05.100 --> 30:07.000
But you are not alone.

30:07.100 --> 30:10.300
There are pockets of Resistance
all around the planet.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.500
We are at the brink.

30:13.900 --> 30:16.200
Do you wanna see a magic
trick? Hold that up.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.600
Press the button.

30:26.900 --> 30:30.600
Effective range of their main
weapon is less than 100 meters.

30:30.700 --> 30:34.600
They pack a lot of firepower,
but the T-600s are heavy and slow.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.400
They are a primitive design.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.600
- Who is that?
- If you can't outrun them...

30:38.800 --> 30:41.100
- I don't know.
- then you have one option.

30:41.300 --> 30:44.800
Their motor cortex is partially
exposed at the back of their neck.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.100
A knife to this area will disorient
their tracking device, but not for long.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.900
Above all, stay alive.
You have no idea...

30:53.100 --> 30:57.500
how important you are, and
how important you will become.

30:57.700 --> 31:01.000
The machines are advancing even
faster than I told you they would.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.700
I've seen it with my own eyes.

31:02.800 --> 31:06.400
They're inventing new, Terminators,
new ways of killing us.

31:07.200 --> 31:10.200
Skynet is planning something big.

31:10.300 --> 31:13.000
But the Resistance is
planning something bigger.

31:15.300 --> 31:16.500
This is John Connor.

31:17.100 --> 31:20.900
If you're listening to
this, you are the Resistance.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
John Connor.

31:26.500 --> 31:28.000
We gotta find this guy.

31:46.900 --> 31:48.000
Ow.

32:01.200 --> 32:05.000
- So you get it working?
- Almost.

32:05.200 --> 32:08.900
Good. Look, I figure
we head east, right?

32:09.100 --> 32:12.700
We go through the desert, then we
can connect with the Resistance there.

32:13.500 --> 32:16.600
- I'm heading north.
- No, no, no.

32:16.800 --> 32:20.200
The machines control the whole
northern sector, up to San Francisco.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.600
- That's Skynet Central.
- I have to find someone.

32:22.800 --> 32:25.600
There's a lot you don't
understand about Skynet, okay?

32:25.800 --> 32:28.700
It's just too dangerous
for us to go there.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.900
What about the L.A. branch?

32:37.000 --> 32:40.900
Come on, man. We 
need to get out of L.A.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.100
What is that?

33:04.900 --> 33:07.500
Something my brother 
used to listen to.

33:12.700 --> 33:14.300
Star, get out.

33:16.800 --> 33:19.100
Don't look at me like that, Star.

33:19.500 --> 33:21.900
Out. Get out!

33:24.200 --> 33:27.200
You're leaving? You're gonna leave us?

33:29.500 --> 33:31.400
Oh, I get it.

33:33.800 --> 33:37.400
You wanna know the difference
between us and the machines?

33:38.000 --> 33:40.300
We bury our dead.

33:41.500 --> 33:44.600
But no one is coming to bury you.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.600
Aerostat!

33:57.500 --> 34:00.200
- It's a scout for the Terminators.
- Go, drive!

34:09.000 --> 34:11.199
The Aerostats heard the music!

34:13.500 --> 34:16.600
- Keep it steady!
- I've never driven before.

34:19.900 --> 34:21.400
Hold the wheel!

34:28.100 --> 34:29.600
This thing's pissing me off!

34:38.199 --> 34:39.400
Kid!

34:39.900 --> 34:40.900
Hold on!

34:56.300 --> 35:00.800
If the idea is to stay
alive, I'm driving.

35:04.600 --> 35:07.900
We're seeing a lot of
enemy movement in L.A.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.400
Any of our people in the area?

35:10.600 --> 35:14.900
No one on the ground. Two A-10s
in the air. Williams and Mihradi.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.100
Send the birds in.

35:17.900 --> 35:19.600
Guide them to a safe area.

35:20.900 --> 35:24.400
Roger, Coyote 67 copies all.
Inbound to grid Lima-Alpha...

35:24.600 --> 35:26.400
125793. Over.

35:26.600 --> 35:29.100
- Copy that.
- Roger, Wild Eagle. Solid copy.

36:26.800 --> 36:29.600
Hey, there's someone here.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.900
Get off him, get down! Get down. Down!

36:34.000 --> 36:36.100
- Drop your weapon!
- Let me see your hands!

36:36.300 --> 36:37.800
- Don't move.
- That's it, drop it.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.800
- Put it down!
- What?

36:42.300 --> 36:45.200
- Is there a problem?
- Hey, we saw your Resistance sign.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.100
The old lady put it there, not me.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.900
- What do you want?
- We're looking for fuel.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.200
The dark season's coming.

36:54.400 --> 36:56.600
We only got enough for ourselves.

36:56.700 --> 37:00.700
You point that gun at somebody, you
better be ready to pull the trigger.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.700
Put your guns down, everyone.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.200
Look, we just came to find
the Resistance, that's all.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.800
The Resistance? Ha.

37:13.100 --> 37:16.900
What a joke. Fighting those
machines is impossible.

37:17.100 --> 37:18.900
We keep our heads down, they ignore us.

37:19.100 --> 37:21.300
They'll come for you eventually.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.100
We help you, maybe they will.

37:23.700 --> 37:26.300
These people aren't going
to help you. Let's go.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.800
You're not going anywhere.

37:28.700 --> 37:30.900
Not until this one
gets something to eat.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.100
Bring me a basket.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.300
Here you go.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.000
Come on. Help yourself. Eat up.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Are you all right, son?

38:03.900 --> 38:05.300
It's our food.

38:05.500 --> 38:09.700
Our fuel. It's not your choice to make!

38:43.800 --> 38:45.000
- Are you okay?
- What?

38:45.200 --> 38:46.500
Are you okay?!

38:46.700 --> 38:49.800
- Star. Star.
- Star! Star!

38:49.900 --> 38:52.600
You! You brought them here!

38:54.800 --> 38:56.500
Hey!

38:56.700 --> 39:00.500
- Stop! Stop!
- Come on, quick!

39:00.700 --> 39:05.100
- Hey.
- Go! Go! Forget them! Go! Go!

39:08.200 --> 39:09.700
Go!

39:14.800 --> 39:18.200
- Tunnels! Head for the tunnels!
- Truck!

39:31.200 --> 39:32.500
Marcus. Marcus.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.400
We can't just run for it!

39:47.700 --> 39:49.400
Run!

40:25.800 --> 40:27.300
Shoot it!

40:31.800 --> 40:33.000
Go, go, go!

40:39.600 --> 40:41.000
It didn't work!

40:42.400 --> 40:43.800
Shit!

41:16.100 --> 41:17.900
Ha. Hell, yeah!

41:22.600 --> 41:23.700
Oh.

41:35.400 --> 41:37.600
Moto-Terminators!

41:49.900 --> 41:51.200
Shoot that son of a bitch!

42:08.700 --> 42:10.900
Marcus, turn right up here.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.500
Hold on!

42:34.600 --> 42:36.300
Where's the other one?

42:52.100 --> 42:54.100
Get up here!

42:55.500 --> 42:56.800
Ugh. Ah!

43:00.300 --> 43:01.900
Come on.

43:02.400 --> 43:03.800
Star, give me the gun.

43:04.700 --> 43:06.200
I got it.

43:08.200 --> 43:09.800
Yeah!

43:19.000 --> 43:20.100
Hang on!

43:27.900 --> 43:30.400
- Drop the ball!
- All right.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.200
Ah!

44:10.200 --> 44:12.300
- Star, hold on!
- Ah!

44:18.900 --> 44:21.800
- Star! Star!
- No!

45:00.800 --> 45:02.600
- Kyle!
- Marcus.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.000
Get back.

45:09.100 --> 45:11.400
Marcus! Marcus!

45:13.400 --> 45:14.600
Ah!

45:16.400 --> 45:18.100
Got eyes on two targets.

45:18.300 --> 45:20.800
We've got two bogeys at 270 degrees.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.400
They've never come this deep before.
They're looking for something.

45:30.300 --> 45:32.300
H.K. is down.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.400
We've got an H.K. pushing our six.

45:49.500 --> 45:51.700
- Abort run.
- Breaking off.

45:58.800 --> 46:00.400
Evasive maneuvers, now!

46:05.900 --> 46:08.100
Taking fire. I'm hit. Port-side damage.

46:14.200 --> 46:16.000
Break off.

46:19.300 --> 46:22.000
- Eject, Williams, eject!
- Punching out.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.600
Prisoner transport headed northwest...

46:43.800 --> 46:46.200
bearing 289 toward San Francisco.

46:48.600 --> 46:50.800
Let's test the signal...

46:51.400 --> 46:53.200
and pray it works.

47:32.200 --> 47:33.500
Ah.

47:48.500 --> 47:49.500
Ugh.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.300
You okay?

47:51.500 --> 47:54.200
Get my knife. It's in my left boot.

48:01.700 --> 48:03.300
What's your name?

48:03.500 --> 48:05.500
Blair Williams.

48:07.100 --> 48:08.600
What's yours?

48:12.900 --> 48:14.100
Name's Marcus.

48:15.100 --> 48:17.300
You can let me down now, Marcus.

48:25.700 --> 48:30.400
- That thing, where'd it go?
- The transport? Skynet.

48:30.500 --> 48:33.700
- Where the hell are you going?
- After it.

48:33.900 --> 48:37.500
I hate to break it to you, but if
you have friends on that thing...

48:37.700 --> 48:41.600
they're as good as dead. And same
as you, if you walk in that direction.

48:41.800 --> 48:44.600
Yeah, I've been dead a while
and I'm getting used to it.

48:44.800 --> 48:46.700
Why don't you come with me to my base?

48:46.900 --> 48:49.000
Connor might know a way.

48:52.400 --> 48:54.800
If you have a problem
with the machines...

48:54.900 --> 48:57.400
he's definitely the
guy you wanna talk to.

48:59.400 --> 49:03.100
- How far is your base?
- Should be one or two days' hike.

49:03.300 --> 49:04.900
And it's that way.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.300
What are you saying? Speak English!

49:34.100 --> 49:39.100
I was telling him it is not true
about the machines killing us.

49:39.300 --> 49:42.100
They're gonna kill us.
They're gonna kill everyone.

49:42.300 --> 49:44.600
We're on the way to the slaughterhouse!

49:44.800 --> 49:47.800
Calm down. You're not helping.

49:48.800 --> 49:53.300
The most important thing we
can do right now is stay alive.

49:53.500 --> 49:55.200
In here and in here.

49:56.300 --> 49:58.700
All right? Just stay alive.

50:14.800 --> 50:16.700
Over there.

50:23.200 --> 50:27.500
Find something we can burn.
We'll be at my base tomorrow.

50:30.100 --> 50:31.800
Are you hurt?

50:33.500 --> 50:35.200
I'm fine.

51:46.900 --> 51:48.900
What do you got there?

51:51.600 --> 51:53.800
Just some antibiotics.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.100
Antibiotics are hard
to come by these days.

51:57.200 --> 52:00.600
Listen. I don't have much, but
you're welcome to whatever you need.

52:01.400 --> 52:02.600
We've been watching you.

52:04.900 --> 52:07.000
You looking for this?

52:08.100 --> 52:11.100
Come on, guys. The
machines are the enemy.

52:11.200 --> 52:13.700
- We're all on the same side.
- No, no.

52:13.900 --> 52:16.300
You see, I got a couple
friends on my side.

52:16.500 --> 52:19.900
Maybe they can carry you
home when I'm done with you.

52:22.600 --> 52:24.400
You might want to chamber a round.

52:26.300 --> 52:27.700
- Oh, no.
- No.

52:31.200 --> 52:34.500
- We done caught us a donkey!
- Been waiting for you.

52:54.500 --> 52:56.800
Unh! Richter!

53:11.500 --> 53:14.100
Killing me ain't gonna win this war!

53:18.800 --> 53:20.300
Ah!

54:00.200 --> 54:02.600
Thinking about your past?

54:11.100 --> 54:13.600
You know what I've learned, Marcus?

54:16.200 --> 54:19.500
Is you can focus on what is lost...

54:22.400 --> 54:26.800
or you can fight for what is left.

54:38.300 --> 54:40.600
I'm a little cold.

54:49.100 --> 54:50.900
Relax.

54:53.800 --> 54:56.300
I just want some body heat.

55:02.100 --> 55:04.600
You have a strong heart.

55:06.500 --> 55:09.100
God, I love that sound.

55:15.500 --> 55:19.200
Thank you for saving me back there.

55:20.700 --> 55:23.500
I don't meet a lot of
good guys these days.

55:25.300 --> 55:26.600
I'm not a good guy.

55:33.500 --> 55:35.000
You are.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.500
You just don't know it yet.

55:47.400 --> 55:50.500
Do you think people
deserve a second chance?

55:53.700 --> 55:56.800
Yeah, I do.

55:59.900 --> 56:04.800
This is it. Skynet's valley of
death. We never been this deep before.

56:04.900 --> 56:07.800
We gotta be sure the signal
works in their territory...

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
on the bigger machines.

56:20.200 --> 56:22.000
That'll bring them in.

56:39.200 --> 56:41.600
H.K. incoming.

57:02.800 --> 57:04.600
Turn it up!

57:16.900 --> 57:18.100
Oh...

57:26.800 --> 57:30.800
It works, man. The signal
works. It's beautiful.

57:42.200 --> 57:43.400
Commander Ashdown's on.

57:43.600 --> 57:45.000
Connor, tell me it works.

57:45.200 --> 57:48.100
It works. That is
affirmative. The signal works.

57:48.300 --> 57:52.200
Good. The attack commences
tomorrow at 0400, worldwide.

57:52.300 --> 57:55.800
Your unit will be in support of
the bombing of Skynet Central.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.300
What is the extraction
plan for the prisoners?

57:58.500 --> 58:00.700
Extraction plan? There
is no extraction plan.

58:00.800 --> 58:05.100
- We're gonna level the place.
- Negative. I told you...

58:05.300 --> 58:08.500
Skynet Central is
filled with human prisoners!

58:10.100 --> 58:11.300
This is war, Connor.

58:11.500 --> 58:15.300
Leadership has its costs. You,
above all, should know that.

58:17.300 --> 58:19.300
Ashdown, come in!

58:19.600 --> 58:21.500
Ashdown, Connor.

58:21.700 --> 58:24.500
Ashdown,
come- Damn him!

58:37.400 --> 58:40.500
Star! Get back! Get back!

58:47.300 --> 58:49.900
You have to calm down now.

59:04.200 --> 59:06.900
I gotta get out! I
gotta get out of here!

59:23.600 --> 59:24.800
Blair?

59:25.000 --> 59:26.400
What?

59:29.200 --> 59:32.400
This is us. The mines are magnetic.

59:32.600 --> 59:35.900
If we head due west at this
point of entry, we're good.

59:38.200 --> 59:39.900
I'll go first.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:11.600
Let's go, Marcus. I'm starving.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.900
For thou art with me.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:25.500
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:27.000
Father.

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:32.000
This is the beginning...

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.600
of something wonderful.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.100
Son of a bitch is heavy.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.600
- What have we got?
- He stepped on a land mine.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.200
Start a large-bore IV.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.700
- Keep it open. More morphine.
- I'm okay.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.500
- What's his name?
- Marcus.

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:52.100
- He's got a prosthetic limb?
- What?

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.200
Okay, pulse is good.
Let's see what we've got.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.700
Barnes.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.200
The devil's hands have been busy.

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.900
What is it?

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:18.300
It's real flesh and blood, though
it seems to heal itself quickly.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:22.300
The heart is human and very powerful.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:25.100
The brain, too, but
with a chip interface.

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:28.100
- What have you done to me?
- It has a hybrid nervous system.

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:31.900
One human cortex, one machine.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Blair, what have they done?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.600
Who built you?

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.900
My name is Marcus Wright.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
You think you're human?

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.200
I am human.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.400
No!

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.100
No!

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.500
Where were you manufactured?

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.700
I was born...

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:29.300
August 22, 1975.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.700
No.

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.800
I know you.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.600
I heard your voice on the radio.

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:49.700
- You're John Connor.
- Of course you know me.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.400
You were sent here to kill me.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.400
Kill the leadership.

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:59.100
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Then why are you here?

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.500
Blair said you'd help me
find who I'm looking for.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:09.600
- Now, let me down.
- If I let you down...

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.600
you'll kill everyone in this room.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.500
Just you, Connor. Because I
don't give a shit about you.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.500
I didn't know your
name till two days ago.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.100
No.

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.500
You and me...

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:32.900
we've been at war since
before either of us even existed.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.900
You tried killing my
mother, Sarah Connor.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.000
You killed my father, Kyle Reese.

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:45.300
You will not kill me.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:52.300
Kyle Reese is on a
transporter heading for Skynet.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.500
If I wanted to kill him...

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.100
I'd have done him in L.A.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.800
Where'd you find that thing?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.900
You sent Mihradi and me to
provide cover for some civilians.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.400
- He was one of them.
- Was there a teenage boy?

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.100
I don't know. They were taken into a
transport. He was the only one left.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.200
Not "he," Blair: "It. "

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.200
It was the only one
left. Don't be naive.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.300
It saved my life.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.400
Kate, what's gonna happen to him?

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.100
Disassembled.

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:36.400
- You mean killed.
- It may have information on Skynet.

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:42.800
I know he's not the enemy. I've been
shot at by the enemy. That's not him.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
That machine saved you only to
gain access to kill all of us.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.400
We're gonna be okay. Don't worry.

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.300
For my brother.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.100
No!

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.100
Connor wants to see you.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.300
What for?

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.000
Like he's gonna tell me, Barnes.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.600
Let me see that.

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:27.000
Want me to tell Connor
you're not coming?

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.600
No.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.700
Watch him.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.700
I told you everything I know, John.

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:07.800
Skynet is ruthless and unpredictable.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.200
They will use the best part
of you against yourself.

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:15.100
And they will have methods
I can't imagine or predict...

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:17.700
that I can't help you with.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:22.900
And when you're unsure, well, just
always follow your heart, John.

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:26.500
I love you. Goodbye.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.900
There's nothing about
machines with organs.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.900
That thing in there...

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.600
I thought I knew our enemy.

01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:41.500
But that thing, that makes
me feel like I know nothing.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.900
I looked in its eyes, and it
believes, absolutely believes...

01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.300
that it is human.

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:52.800
It believes everything that it says.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.100
And it is telling me...

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:57.200
that Kyle Reese is in Skynet.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.100
If that is true...

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:05.700
then Command is about to bomb my
father and the rest of those prisoners...

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.800
and I cannot stop them.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:16.899
Thank you.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.600
Come in.

01:08:21.899 --> 01:08:24.600
What's up? Blair said you needed me.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.700
Get in.

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:49.200
Get him.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:00.800
- Barnes. What about Blair?
- She made her choice.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.600
Get down!

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:16.300
Let's move.

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:31.100
- Get some light out there!
- We're back in the minefield.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:32.399
I have a plan.

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:49.800
- Let's run!
- There they go, they're on the move.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.100
- Blair, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay!

01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:00.300
- I can't see back!
- There they are!

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.900
Run! Go!

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.700
Now what?

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.500
My plan stopped at the jeep.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.500
Sniper Team 1, do you have a shot?

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.600
I'll draw the fire.
You take out the light.

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:42.700
I got a target!

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:51.300
Go! Now! Keep your head
down! Keep your head down!

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.100
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:55.900
Go! Go, keep running!

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:03.700
Come on! Come on!

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.600
- You all right?
- Let's get you out of here.

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:18.800
There they are!

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.800
Stay on the ground! 
Stay on the ground!

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.600
You come on straight down. I'm going in.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.600
- Do not move!
- Keep your eye on him!

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.300
Flip him!

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.400
Iron Gator, this is Scarface 51. 
We have eyes on the machine.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.600
Contact initiated.

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.000
Take my gun!

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.900
Check the river.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:42.000
You see him?

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:09.500
Hydraulics are out!

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.300
Ahh!

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:24.600
Give me your hand! Give me your hand!

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:16.300
- They know you, even if you don't.
- Enough!

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.000
That gun ain't gonna stop shit!

01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:22.000
Nobody's shot you in the heart,
and I see that thing beating!

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:23.800
Kyle Reese.

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:27.200
He's in Skynet. You do that, he's dead.

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:29.900
I can get you in.

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:32.100
How?

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.500
Look at me.

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.000
That's why I don't trust you.

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:48.600
I'm the only hope you have.

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:55.100
I need to find who did this to me.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.100
So do you.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.500
Connor!

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:08.600
Make your choice.

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:11.900
You get me in.

01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:18.600
You tell me where I 
can find Kyle Reese.

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.100
Yeah?

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:23.900
I will.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:34.400
Contact me on that. Let
me know he's still alive.

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:41.100
What are you?

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.900
I don't know.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:53.000
He's over here!

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:57.400
You all right?

01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:00.400
Any sign of him?

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:02.800
He's gone.

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:11.800
Why'd you do it?

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.300
I saw a man...

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.400
not a machine.

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.100
How's that leg?

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:30.200
- I'll live.
- Let her go!

01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:41.800
Connor? Command for you.

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:46.300
- This is Connor.
- Connor, are your men ready?

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.500
Negative. Nobody is ready.

01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:53.500
We are not, you are not. We must
abort the attack. The game has changed.

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:57.100
What are you talking about? All
elements are past their release points.

01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:58.900
They're in assault position.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.700
Then delay the attack. At least,
delay the attack. I have a chance...

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:06.600
to infiltrate Skynet and rescue those
prisoners. Give me that opportunity.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:10.400
No, absolutely not! This is not
the time for a rescue mission!

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:13.000
What you ask for will
undermine the whole operation.

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.800
Skynet has Kyle Reese.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.900
- Then that is his fate.
- It's our fate.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.900
I have to save him. He is the key.

01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:27.100
The key to the future, to the past.
Without him, we lose everything.

01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:29.200
No, you stay the course!

01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:33.600
If we stay the course, we
are dead! We are all dead!

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.600
As of this moment, soldier...

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.600
you are relieved of your command.

01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:42.300
You are no longer a
part of this Resistance.

01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:51.600
I didn't catch that last statement.

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.700
Neither did I.

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:57.800
This is John Connor.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.200
If you're listening to
this, you are the Resistance.

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:05.700
Listen carefully. If
we attack tonight...

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.300
Our humanity is lost.

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:12.500
I once knew a woman who told
people to fear the future...

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:16.800
that the end was coming,
that all would be lost.

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:22.300
Nobody wanted to hear her
truths. Society locked her away.

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:26.800
That woman was 
Sarah Connor, my mother.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:31.100
Now we know that what she
predicted has all come to pass.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.700
Command wants us 
to fight like machines.

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:37.000
They want us to make
cold, calculated decisions.

01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:39.300
But we are not machines!

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:44.300
And if we behave like them, then
what is the point in winning?

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:49.100
Command is going to ask
you to attack Skynet.

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:52.400
I am asking you not to.

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.500
If even one bomb drops on
Skynet before sunrise...

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:02.500
our future will be lost.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:07.000
So please, stand down.
Give me the time...

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.000
to protect our
future that all of us...

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.000
are fighting for.

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:17.400
This is John Connor.

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:44.300
What should I tell your men
when they find out you're gone?

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.100
I'll be back.

01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:45.400
I'm coming for you.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.500
Come on, Marcus.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.700
Kyle.

01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:45.000
Okay.

01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:24.700
Signal broadcasting
at full strength, sir.

01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:29.700
- Good. Commence bombing of Skynet.
- We have a green light to attack.

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:32.400
This is Bakersfield. That's
a no-go on your last. Out.

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.100
Eugene, standing down.

01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:35.700
This is Reno. Negative on your last.

01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:38.800
Eugene, Reno, Bakersfield.
They're all standing down.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.800
They will not attack unless
Connor gives the order.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.700
Kyle Reese?

01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:15.700
Get to the transport!
Go! Is Kyle Reese here?

01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:38.200
Welcome home, Marcus.

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:39.400
We knew you'd be back.

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:42.700
After all, it was 
programmed in you.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:48.600
Oh. And you executed that
programming beautifully.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.400
What am I?

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:55.000
You are an infiltration prototype.
The only one of your kind.

01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:59.900
We resurrected you, advanced
Cyberdyne's work, amended it.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.400
You're dead.

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:06.700
Calculations confirm Serena Kogan's
face is the easiest for you to process.

01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:08.800
We can be others if you wish.

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:14.600
Marcus, what else could you be...

01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:16.400
if not machine?

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.900
A man.

01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:21.400
The human condition no
longer applies to you.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.700
Accept what you already know.

01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:26.900
That you were made 
to serve a purpose.

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:31.400
To achieve what no other
machine has achieved before.

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:38.800
To infiltrate, find a target, and
then bring that target back home to us.

01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:44.900
We've been at war since before
either of us even existed.

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:48.800
You tried killing my
mother, Sarah Connor.

01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:51.100
You get me in.

01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:53.800
You tell me where 
I can find Kyle Reese.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.400
- Yeah?
- I will.

01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:03.400
Kyle Reese! Kyle Reese! 
Move! Move!

01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:06.100
Kyle Reese!

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:08.400
Get to the transports!

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:10.000
- Kyle Reese?
- No.

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:18.700
You! Move!

01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:23.200
In times of desperation, people will
believe what they want to believe.

01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:27.500
And so, we gave them what
they wanted to believe.

01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:31.500
A trick, in the form of a signal the
Resistance thought would win the war.

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.900
And they were right,
it will end this war.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.300
Except that it is the Resistance
that will be terminated.

01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:39.900
Not Skynet.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.800
Get the attack on Skynet
Central back online.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.700
I want our aircraft
in the sky immediately.

01:29:52.900 --> 01:29:56.000
Sir. Sir, we've got a bogey with
a very large radar signature...

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:58.300
closing in on our position.

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:10.000
Losenko?

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:17.800
We have destroyed ourselves.

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:22.400
Skynet tracked our signal.
We led them straight to us.

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.100
Our best machines had failed time
and again to complete a mission.

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:43.100
Something was missing. We
had to think. Radically.

01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:48.100
And so we made you. We created
the perfect infiltration machine.

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:51.100
You, Marcus.

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:54.900
You did what Skynet has
failed to do for so many years.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.600
You killed John Connor.

01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:00.300
Kyle!

01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:02.300
Hey!

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.500
Don't fight, Marcus.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.800
Remember what you are.

01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:19.000
I know what I am.

01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:33.400
I'm better this way.

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:36.500
You will not be 
given a second chance.

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:41.100
- You cannot save John Connor.
- Watch me.

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.000
Got a message from Connor.

01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:14.600
He's in Skynet, needs air support.

01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:20.100
Let's go. Scramble aircraft!

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.900
Star! Star, go!

01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:34.900
Star!

01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:38.300
Star! Star! Come on. Come on.

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:02.800
- What's your name?
- Kyle Reese.

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:10.100
Stay with me.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.300
Back!

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.300
Back!

01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:49.000
Come on, Star, move! Move!

01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:18.300
T-800s.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.200
There's so many of them.

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:41.800
Careful.

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:48.600
- What are these?
- Fuel cells.

01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:51.700
Life source for the T-800.

01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:55.300
Nuclear.

01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.200
Enough to level this place.

01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:01.800
Cover us.

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:04.800
Get ready.

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:10.500
This is it.

01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:36.300
Run!

01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:38.900
Star, come on! Let's go!

01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:41.900
Get in.

01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:46.800
Come on!

01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:52.700
We gotta get to the transport.

01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.600
- Where are you going?
- I gotta end this.

01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:01.500
No, no. I'm not gonna leave you!

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.600
- You didn't.
- Who are you?

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:06.900
John Connor.

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:18.700
Hey! Hey, John Connor's in
there. He's still in there.

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:20.800
Chris, she's hypovolemic, start a line!

01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:22.700
- What?
- John Connor's in there.

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:24.700
Come with me.

01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:45.300
Connor!

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.100
Connor, help!

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.400
Help!

01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:56.800
Connor, it's Kyle. Help!

01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:59.600
Do it! You son of a bitch!

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.300
Come on!

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:35.700
Come on!

01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:00.700
Come on!

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:53.600
Let's get out of here.

01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:12.900
John.

01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:22.100
We can't make it back to base. Set
this down in the nearest safe zone.

01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:31.500
Medevac, urgent. 
Severe chest trauma.

01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:36.300
- Call the surgical team.
- it's Connor.

01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:55.500
How long?

01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:01.000
His heart...

01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:03.900
can't take it.

01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:07.500
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, Kate.

01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:09.500
Kyle?

01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:24.200
Take it.

01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:45.700
You earned it.

01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:05.600
Kate?

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:13.300
Take mine.

01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:15.900
Marcus...

01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:22.500
Everybody deserves 
a second chance.

01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:27.000
This is mine.

01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:26.900
What is it that makes us human?

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:31.500
It's not something you can program.

01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:35.500
You can't put it into a chip.

01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:39.500
It's the strength 
of the human heart.

01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:44.600
The difference between 
us and machines.

01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:08.700
There is a storm on the horizon.
A time of hardship and pain.

01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:14.100
This battle has been won, but the
war against the machines rages on.

01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:17.200
Skynet's global network remains strong.

01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:20.000
But we will not quit...

01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:22.200
until all of it is destroyed.

01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:28.000
This is John Connor. There
is no fate but what we make.
