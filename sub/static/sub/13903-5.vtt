Swearing? I didn't realise
I was...swearing.

Do you want to come over?
Like at your place?

01:31.270 --> 01:33.310
Yeah.

01:33.310 --> 01:36.390
I can make lunch or...dinner.

01:36.390 --> 01:38.470

01:38.470 --> 01:41.510
You mean dinner like cutlery dinner

wanted to go.

18:38.573 --> 18:40.533
Yeah. So you do.

18:41.013 --> 18:43.173
What's her name?
Vanessa.

18:43.173 --> 18:45.133
Vanessa.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.893
Poor Vanessa.

18:51.533 --> 18:53.533
Cos I bet she knows it.

19:19.453 --> 19:21.413
# ADELE 19 : Hometown Glory

19:21.413 --> 19:24.773
# I've been working in the same way

19:25.533 --> 19:28.813
# As I did

19:29.413 --> 19:33.013
# Missing out the cracks
in the pavement

19:33.013 --> 19:37.373
# And tutting my heel,
strutting my feet

19:37.373 --> 19:41.293
# Is there anything
I can do for you dear

19:41.293 --> 19:45.093
# Is there anyone I could call

19:45.533 --> 19:48.653
# No and thank you, please, Madam

19:48.653 --> 19:53.213
# I ain't lost, just wandering

19:54.813 --> 19:57.773
# Round my home town

19:57.893 --> 20:02.893
# Memories are fresh

20:02.893 --> 20:05.333
# Round my home town

20:06.093 --> 20:10.213
# Ooh, the people I've met

20:10.653 --> 20:14.253
# Are the wonders of my world
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

20:14.693 --> 20:18.333
# Are the wonders of my world

20:18.853 --> 20:23.093
# Are the wonders of this world
Hello?

20:23.093 --> 20:25.053
# Are the wonders...

20:46.813 --> 20:48.813
Just checking.

20:49.453 --> 20:51.453
Just checking if it's true.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.213
And it is.

20:57.093 --> 20:59.093
Isn't it...Belle?

21:05.453 --> 21:08.693
# You get the people
and the government

21:08.693 --> 21:12.893
# Everybody taking different sides

21:13.493 --> 21:16.333
# Shows that we ain't gonna
stand shit

21:16.333 --> 21:18.373
# Shows that we are united

21:18.373 --> 21:20.973
# Shows that we ain't gonna take it

21:21.413 --> 21:24.093
# Shows that we ain't gonna
stand shit

21:24.093 --> 21:28.293
# Shows that we are united

21:28.613 --> 21:31.093
# Round my home town

21:31.693 --> 21:36.893
# Memories are fresh

21:36.893 --> 21:38.933
# Round my home town

21:39.733 --> 21:43.813
# Ooh, the people I've met

21:43.813 --> 21:45.853
# Yeah #
