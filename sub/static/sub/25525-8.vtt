00:01.355 --> 00:03.253
Previously on "The Outpost"...

00:03.256 --> 00:04.933
"Gallows Rock, sundown."

00:04.936 --> 00:08.704
Want to tell me why Greyskins
would be selling colipsum to humans?

00:08.707 --> 00:12.293
Trouble at the cages, sir. They've
turned Plagueling and escaped.

00:15.242 --> 00:17.942
Lilly was more to that just
a handmaid to me, Mr. Wythers.

00:17.944 --> 00:20.676
And I intend to get to the
bottom of this awful business.

00:20.679 --> 00:22.512
You murdered her!

00:22.515 --> 00:25.184
- Your badge, sir.
- Take him to the mine.

00:25.187 --> 00:27.921
There is a book full of names.

00:27.924 --> 00:30.287
Bring me one page as
proof, burn the rest.

00:30.290 --> 00:32.258
I think the Book of Names
is actually a book full of...

00:32.259 --> 00:33.793
Full of demon names?

00:33.796 --> 00:36.195
There's some kind of mention
of... of the "Vex Rezicon."

00:36.198 --> 00:39.286
- Does it say anything about the Dragman?
- No.

00:39.289 --> 00:42.101
"Tiberion Shek and Bones dead."

00:42.104 --> 00:45.238
We will go there, and we
will kill the Blackblood.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.160
Ho, brewer!

00:56.163 --> 00:57.976
Let me have a taste of your wares.

00:57.979 --> 01:00.147
These are empty. There's
nothing in here that you want.

01:00.150 --> 01:02.907
You're straining
awfully hard for empties.

01:02.910 --> 01:07.479
Well, they're not empty.
No, I, um, I fill the empties

01:07.482 --> 01:11.294
with, um, with... with...
With hops and... and barley.

01:11.297 --> 01:13.658
Well, then you have to declare them.

01:13.661 --> 01:15.871
Taxes, please.

01:15.874 --> 01:18.241
Of course.

01:18.243 --> 01:20.777
Talon, I'll pay you back double.

01:27.041 --> 01:29.542
Should cover it.

01:29.545 --> 01:31.912
Should indeed.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.730
Two gold beads?

01:38.733 --> 01:40.443
A copper would have done just the trick.

01:40.446 --> 01:42.660
You're paying me back double, remember?

01:50.612 --> 01:52.400
Bloody hell, those things are heavy.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.044
You're back.

01:54.047 --> 01:56.396
Mistress wants to see you.

01:56.399 --> 01:58.584
I need a drink, Janzo.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.388
Wanted to see you as
soon as you got back.

02:01.390 --> 02:04.568
We're a little parched, Munt, so
she's going to have to wait a minute.

02:08.134 --> 02:12.022
- He's back!
- Janzo!

02:12.025 --> 02:13.752
Janzo!

02:16.071 --> 02:17.803
Good dog.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.547 --> 02:29.581
So did they show up?
Did the shipment arrive?

02:29.584 --> 02:31.784
Well, I'm alive and unharmed,
thank you for asking.

02:31.787 --> 02:33.520
Uh-huh.

02:33.523 --> 02:34.991
What did you do with your arm?

02:34.994 --> 02:36.825
Oh, well, I broke it.

02:36.828 --> 02:40.993
Because you abandoned me,
and I had to do your job.

02:40.996 --> 02:44.090
- Well, are you all right?
- Don't worry about the arm.

02:44.093 --> 02:49.321
Did it show... up?

02:49.324 --> 02:52.416
- Yes.
- And?

02:52.419 --> 02:55.587
And they gave us almost
30 shares of colipsum.

02:59.453 --> 03:01.420
30?

03:01.422 --> 03:03.288
That's more than double.

03:03.290 --> 03:06.025
That's more than triple.

03:06.027 --> 03:08.370
Janzo!

03:08.373 --> 03:10.440
Janzo, my favorite son.

03:10.443 --> 03:12.845
My favorite boy.

03:12.848 --> 03:15.738
How did you manage to
get so much out of them?

03:15.741 --> 03:17.407
There's something that you should know.

03:17.410 --> 03:20.540
- What?
- The colipsum comes from Greyskins.

03:21.977 --> 03:24.011
Well, it doesn't matter
where they came from,

03:24.013 --> 03:25.646
as long as it's pure and
as long as it's cheap.

03:25.648 --> 03:28.115
I don't think you heard
me the first time, Mother.

03:28.117 --> 03:30.484
The Greyskin is the supplier.

03:30.486 --> 03:32.486
You know, enemy of the Realm?

03:32.488 --> 03:34.288
Number one threat to humankind?

03:34.290 --> 03:37.643
Big, ugly, want to wipe
us out? Those Greyskins.

03:37.646 --> 03:38.927
Let me get this straight.

03:38.929 --> 03:43.198
You actually saw an actual Greyskin?

03:43.200 --> 03:44.717
- And they didn't eat you?
- No.

03:44.720 --> 03:47.170
- And they gave you more than you paid for?
- Yes.

03:47.172 --> 03:50.186
They are clearly

03:50.189 --> 03:53.075
not as nasty as their
reputation suggests.

03:54.646 --> 03:55.912
Mother, we shouldn't have anything to do

03:55.914 --> 03:57.380
with colipsum coming from Greyskins.

03:57.382 --> 03:58.884
There's something not right about that.

03:58.886 --> 04:00.551
Of course it's right. They're Greyskins.

04:00.553 --> 04:02.286
They're exotic, and if they want gold,

04:02.288 --> 04:04.262
let's give them gold.
Where's the harm in that?

04:04.265 --> 04:07.387
Mother! They didn't even count it.

04:07.390 --> 04:09.626
Of course they didn't
count it. They're Greyskins.

04:09.629 --> 04:13.001
They're dumb as dogs. They probably
don't even know how to count.

04:16.036 --> 04:17.869
You know...

04:17.870 --> 04:21.290
a better man than you would
have gotten me ten brickloads.

04:23.878 --> 04:26.721
Is that right?

04:26.724 --> 04:29.058
Then send Munt next time.

04:29.061 --> 04:32.229
Your precious little
shipment's downstairs.

04:42.030 --> 04:44.598
He's growing up, that boy.

04:59.712 --> 05:01.679
Hello?

05:05.456 --> 05:06.822
Hello?

05:17.602 --> 05:19.836
Garret? What are you doing in here?

05:21.309 --> 05:23.444
I need you to kill me.

05:27.147 --> 05:31.629
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

05:31.632 --> 05:33.498
I was injected by a Plagueling.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.294
It's only a matter
of time before I turn,

05:35.297 --> 05:37.333
so just... kill me now.

05:37.336 --> 05:40.325
Well, I'm not going to
kill you, Garret. I can't.

05:40.327 --> 05:43.862
Oh, come on, Janzo. I don't want
to turn into one of those things.

05:43.864 --> 05:45.998
- Janzo? Now we had a deal.
- Talon.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.102
You have to find this Book of
Names before this Dragman thing...

05:50.104 --> 05:53.806
- What's going on?
- He's been infected. Plagueling.

05:53.808 --> 05:55.641
What?

05:55.643 --> 05:58.412
How are you feeling? Are
you sweating profusely?

05:58.414 --> 06:00.347
Is your heart beating fast?

06:00.349 --> 06:02.382
I... I don't know. You... you tell me.

06:02.384 --> 06:05.052
He's sweating, all right.

06:05.054 --> 06:08.033
Hmm. Your heart's
definitely beating fast.

06:08.036 --> 06:09.924
That might just be
because you're scared.

06:09.926 --> 06:11.726
I'm not.

06:11.728 --> 06:13.761
- Are you drunk?
- Are you drunk?

06:13.763 --> 06:15.776
I am. Yeah, yeah. I'm quite.

06:15.779 --> 06:18.984
But it's because I've been down here
all day, and this is very good ale.

06:18.987 --> 06:20.635
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

06:20.637 --> 06:22.171
I thought you didn't
drink or use colipsum.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.006
It's funny how all that
tends to just, pfft,

06:24.008 --> 06:25.507
out the window when you're dying.

06:25.509 --> 06:27.109
- You're not going to die.
- Yes, he is.

06:27.111 --> 06:28.444
Yes, I am.

06:28.446 --> 06:31.413
Please hold. Thank you.

06:33.117 --> 06:36.286
Now, when were you infected?

06:36.288 --> 06:39.589
It was, uh, two nights past.

06:39.591 --> 06:41.358
There was an outbreak at the camp.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.660
Is it just me or is it
really hot down here?

06:43.662 --> 06:46.944
It's very hot down here. The
fermenting ale gives off heat.

06:46.947 --> 06:48.073
Ah!

06:48.076 --> 06:50.027
Does it hurt when I prod
you with a needle like that?

06:50.029 --> 06:52.400
Yes. What does that mean?

06:52.403 --> 06:54.534
- I don't know.
- Well, why did you do it then?

06:54.537 --> 06:56.240
Just collecting data.

07:00.481 --> 07:03.048
- Open wide.
- Ahh. Ahh, ahh.

07:03.050 --> 07:06.796
Thank you. Hmm. I don't see anything,

07:06.799 --> 07:09.055
although I guess I should
have known that already,

07:09.057 --> 07:11.090
because you were only stung two days ago

07:11.092 --> 07:12.892
and I guess the soonest
anyone turns Plagueling

07:12.894 --> 07:14.394
is three days after infection,

07:14.396 --> 07:16.758
although some take up to six days.

07:16.761 --> 07:18.630
So that's how long we
have to find a cure.

07:18.633 --> 07:21.568
There is no cure, Talon.

07:21.570 --> 07:23.537
Well, you don't know if you don't try.

07:23.539 --> 07:26.936
Well, hold on now. Not everyone
who'd stung actually turns, right?

07:26.939 --> 07:29.501
Just one in 13, best I can figure.

07:29.504 --> 07:32.038
Don't like those odds.

07:32.041 --> 07:34.780
Go get Gwynn. I should say goodbye.

07:34.783 --> 07:38.179
- Yes, go and get Gwynn.
- No, you go and get Gwynn.

07:38.182 --> 07:40.822
- Why me?
- Go.

07:46.230 --> 07:48.497
Do not touch her.

07:48.499 --> 07:49.832
Okay.

07:52.966 --> 07:54.165
Come on.

07:59.778 --> 08:03.113
Talon, you are the only person
that I can trust to kill me.

08:03.115 --> 08:05.431
N... no.

08:05.434 --> 08:10.121
- Janzo will figure this out.
- Maybe.

08:10.123 --> 08:13.825
But if not, you have
to kill me if I turn.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.695
All right? Promise me that you'll
put a blade through my mouth.

08:18.898 --> 08:21.475
I need you to give me your word.

08:25.306 --> 08:26.438
You have my word.

08:28.409 --> 08:30.409
But only when I'm sure you're gone.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.984
Tomorrow we reach Gallwood Outpost,

08:37.986 --> 08:42.389
where we will hunt down a
creature resembling a woman.

08:42.390 --> 08:45.960
In her veins runs
blood blacker than coal.

08:45.962 --> 08:49.697
Your orders are to spill the
blood of every breathing thing

08:49.699 --> 08:53.000
until she is dead at my feet.

08:53.002 --> 08:54.735
Tell your men.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.681
You think I'm obsessed.

09:12.590 --> 09:15.792
The prophecy says that
when the Blackblood rises,

09:15.794 --> 09:18.385
death and pestilence
will fly over the land

09:18.388 --> 09:20.764
like ashes in the wind.

09:20.766 --> 09:24.878
So we have to do whatever
is necessary, yes?

09:27.926 --> 09:32.062
She must die, for the
sake of the living.

10:56.161 --> 10:58.094
Enjoying the view?

11:02.934 --> 11:05.835
Does a body good to get some fresh air,

11:05.838 --> 11:09.378
see the world from a new vantage point.

11:09.381 --> 11:11.582
It's a good way to
think about your future.

11:11.585 --> 11:13.885
What future? I'm a
prisoner just like you.

11:13.888 --> 11:16.088
Just like me?

11:16.091 --> 11:19.183
11 years I've been down here, pinky.

11:19.185 --> 11:20.983
You're nothing like me.

11:20.986 --> 11:23.720
What good is all that
money you make in smuggling

11:23.723 --> 11:25.823
when you're stuck down
here in this rathole?

11:25.825 --> 11:27.845
And you and me both know you smuggle

11:27.846 --> 11:30.209
contraband in and out of the Outpost.

11:32.182 --> 11:35.350
What you moving? Arms? Weapons?

11:35.353 --> 11:39.488
Precious stones or minerals
you find down here in the mines?

11:39.491 --> 11:42.541
They took your badge.
Might be time to let it go.

11:44.846 --> 11:45.979
Yeah.

11:48.283 --> 11:50.283
You got a point there.

11:56.558 --> 11:58.220
Do me a favor.

12:01.740 --> 12:03.954
Thank the Mistress for me.

12:06.209 --> 12:08.110
Tell her I really did...

12:12.643 --> 12:14.209
you know.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.877
Love her?

12:17.381 --> 12:19.081
Care for her.

12:23.121 --> 12:24.487
Care for her.

12:29.561 --> 12:31.595
I can't let you leave.

12:31.597 --> 12:34.064
I gave the Foreman my word
that you'd be back by light,

12:34.066 --> 12:38.068
- and I keep my word.
- Not my problem.

12:43.477 --> 12:45.872
Now can we talk like adults?

12:48.749 --> 12:51.708
Why are you so invested
in keeping me down here?

12:51.711 --> 12:54.820
'Cause if you suddenly
leave, there'll be questions.

12:54.822 --> 12:57.089
An investigation. How did he get out?

12:57.091 --> 12:58.924
Is there a back way out of the mine?

12:58.926 --> 13:01.193
Again, not my problem.

13:01.195 --> 13:02.928
No.

13:02.930 --> 13:05.064
But it is the Mistress's problem.

13:05.066 --> 13:06.967
You'll give away her best route,

13:06.969 --> 13:10.003
helping to make a nice case against her.

13:10.005 --> 13:12.405
I see what you're saying.

13:12.407 --> 13:17.344
So now, what's all this
about how you care about her?

13:17.346 --> 13:18.913
All right.

13:21.785 --> 13:25.186
I'll stick around down here...

13:25.188 --> 13:27.121
for now.

13:27.124 --> 13:29.758
I was hoping you'd see it that way.

13:32.663 --> 13:34.963
That was my best knife.

13:44.209 --> 13:45.775
Hello.

13:52.217 --> 13:53.917
You're the barkeep, aren't you?

13:53.919 --> 13:57.565
Brewer, actually. I have a
message for you, your ladyship.

13:57.568 --> 14:01.031
It's a private message. He told me
that no one else is allowed to know.

14:01.034 --> 14:03.761
He? He who?

14:03.764 --> 14:06.231
- You know where Garret is?
- Now hang on a minute.

14:06.233 --> 14:08.066
I didn't tell you who sent
me. There's absolutely no...

14:08.068 --> 14:09.668
Tell me everything you know.

14:09.670 --> 14:13.171
- Is he all right?
- No, m'lady.

14:13.174 --> 14:17.877
- What?
- He's not okay. He's dying.

14:21.382 --> 14:24.851
- You should have water.
- Thank you.

14:24.853 --> 14:26.819
My sweet Garret.

14:27.889 --> 14:29.822
- Not too close.
- Why?

14:29.824 --> 14:32.559
- I'm infected, Gwynn.
- You're infected?

14:32.561 --> 14:35.272
- He's been stung by a Plagueling.
- Well, cure him!

14:35.275 --> 14:36.811
There is no cure.

14:36.814 --> 14:40.019
Look, the best I can figure
is that there is a parasite

14:40.022 --> 14:43.838
gestating deep down inside of his
throat or his stomach somewhere.

14:43.840 --> 14:47.709
Then, as it grows, the parasite
will grow these long tentacles,

14:47.711 --> 14:49.730
and the tentacles will grow
and they'll start to creep

14:49.732 --> 14:51.598
all the way up inside of his brain.

14:51.601 --> 14:54.450
- Damn it, Janzo!
- There must be something you can do.

14:54.452 --> 14:56.685
Can't you just kill the
creature before it grows?

14:56.687 --> 14:58.594
That's not a bad idea, actually.

14:58.597 --> 15:00.722
You know, I've never
seen an infected person

15:00.725 --> 15:02.580
where they haven't
turned Plagueling before.

15:02.583 --> 15:04.350
Hey, maybe if we give
him some acid to drink...

15:04.352 --> 15:06.779
- What? No!
- No. No, that would definitely kill him, yes.

15:06.782 --> 15:09.100
If he dies, you're next.

15:09.103 --> 15:12.592
- He's going to die anyway.
- Janzo, it's not what she wants to hear.

15:12.595 --> 15:14.771
Look, if he has any chance of surviving,

15:14.773 --> 15:18.409
I cannot hide the truth in order
to avoid hurting her feelings.

15:18.411 --> 15:21.145
And I cannot operate on
him when madam over here

15:21.147 --> 15:24.115
is threatening me with my life.

15:24.117 --> 15:27.084
He's right, Gwynn.

15:27.086 --> 15:29.539
- You should go.
- You summoned me here.

15:29.542 --> 15:32.124
I just wanted to say goodbye,

15:32.126 --> 15:34.008
you know, while... While I'm still me.

15:34.011 --> 15:35.594
No, I'm not going.

15:35.596 --> 15:38.096
I'm not going anywhere
until the barkeep cures you.

15:38.098 --> 15:41.634
Brewer! I am a brewer!

15:41.636 --> 15:44.070
And the chance of a cure is unlikely.

15:44.072 --> 15:47.941
Gwynn, I cannot risk you
getting infected yourself,

15:47.943 --> 15:51.778
and I do not want you to
remember me in this condition.

15:51.780 --> 15:53.877
All right? So, please,
we have to say goodbye.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.416
- You have to go.
- Garret.

15:55.418 --> 15:58.652
I'm not going, Garret.
Garret, I love you.

16:01.223 --> 16:03.691
I do love you.

16:03.693 --> 16:05.994
All right? Now go, please?

16:05.996 --> 16:08.830
Go on. Please.

16:09.733 --> 16:11.800
Talon?

16:11.802 --> 16:14.912
Come with me. I'll take you.

16:28.245 --> 16:32.314
For many years, I've been
afraid of losing Garret.

16:32.316 --> 16:36.552
I mean, he is a soldier
after all, but...

16:36.554 --> 16:39.822
over the years I just convinced
myself he was invincible.

16:39.824 --> 16:42.092
Don't give up yet.

16:44.029 --> 16:46.363
If anyone can beat this, Janzo can.

16:49.701 --> 16:52.168
- It's funny, isn't it?
- What?

16:53.907 --> 16:57.308
How so alike we both are, you and I.

16:57.310 --> 16:58.709
We're nothing alike.

16:58.711 --> 17:01.479
Oh, but we are, Talon.

17:02.782 --> 17:06.518
We're both women in
an Outpost full of men.

17:06.520 --> 17:09.621
Both of our families were
murdered by the Prime Order.

17:11.692 --> 17:15.993
We both possess powers
we wish we didn't have.

17:15.996 --> 17:19.299
We both have a destiny that will
most likely be the death of us.

17:21.269 --> 17:23.036
And we both have feelings for Garret.

17:23.038 --> 17:26.025
What? I don't.

17:26.028 --> 17:29.910
The thought of losing him hurts
you just as much as it hurts me.

17:31.948 --> 17:33.414
I should go.

17:33.416 --> 17:35.373
No, Talon.

17:35.376 --> 17:38.851
It means a great deal that
you're here comforting me.

17:38.854 --> 17:43.058
I mean it when I say I
want us to be friends.

17:43.060 --> 17:44.993
Whatever happens.

17:54.405 --> 17:57.340
We'll get through this together for now.

17:57.342 --> 17:59.241
And if he survives,
we'll sort it out then.

18:00.345 --> 18:03.679
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Talon.

18:07.953 --> 18:10.387
I'll keep you informed about Garret.

18:11.957 --> 18:13.390
Please do.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.799
I can't watch that.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.268
Okay, just a bit more.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.374
It burns.

18:36.984 --> 18:40.687
T... Talon?

18:40.689 --> 18:43.690
It's probably a good idea
for him to rest a little bit.

18:43.692 --> 18:45.625
So will this cure him?

18:45.627 --> 18:46.760
No idea.

18:53.770 --> 18:55.636
The mute watchman's
here to see you, m'lady.

18:55.638 --> 18:57.104
Send him in.

19:06.950 --> 19:08.083
Leave.

19:13.791 --> 19:16.392
Danno?

19:16.394 --> 19:18.528
Is that your name?

19:19.846 --> 19:21.364
You can call off the search.

19:21.366 --> 19:22.965
I found Captain Spears.

19:28.174 --> 19:31.708
Why do you bow as if
I'm some sort of royalty?

19:34.080 --> 19:36.680
You and Wythers were very close.

19:36.682 --> 19:41.252
Who better than you to hold
on to some letters for him

19:41.254 --> 19:44.622
to send on on his behalf
should something befall him?

19:45.959 --> 19:47.826
No?

19:47.828 --> 19:48.960
You deny it?

19:51.164 --> 19:55.034
You can't speak, but I
presume you can write.

19:55.036 --> 20:00.539
And yet, you've made
no demands, no threats.

20:02.844 --> 20:06.346
You could be biding your time.

20:06.348 --> 20:08.115
Or you really could have no intention

20:08.117 --> 20:10.750
of doing anything with
the secret you possess.

20:12.688 --> 20:14.554
They say that the Prime Order Chancellor

20:14.556 --> 20:17.925
burned your throat with a red hot iron

20:17.927 --> 20:21.195
because you protested when he
forced himself on your young wife.

20:23.833 --> 20:27.068
We want the same thing, you and I.

20:27.070 --> 20:29.571
We both want revenge on the Prime Order.

20:33.711 --> 20:37.179
You will be my eyes and ears.

20:37.181 --> 20:39.582
Anything the Watch
knows, I want to know.

20:40.986 --> 20:42.352
Agreed?

20:50.162 --> 20:51.295
And Danno?

20:53.338 --> 20:55.700
Together we will have our revenge.

21:12.352 --> 21:14.352
Janzo?

21:14.354 --> 21:15.488
Come here.

21:21.496 --> 21:24.497
Is this what I think it is?

21:24.499 --> 21:26.699
That's it. That's the Vex Rezicon.

21:26.701 --> 21:28.669
The Book of Names, Talon! You found it.

21:28.671 --> 21:32.272
And it says right here it's
kept in some kind of temple.

21:32.274 --> 21:33.941
The Shrine... Shrine Maer-Nokh?

21:33.943 --> 21:36.753
- Where's that?
- Wait.

21:36.756 --> 21:40.582
Wait. Maer-Nokh, Maer-Nokh. I'll find it.

21:40.584 --> 21:42.450
It's here somewhere. Let me see.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.190
This one.

21:53.097 --> 21:56.465
- Maer-Nokh.
- What kind of map is this?

21:57.902 --> 22:01.103
- Nothing looks familiar.
- Mm, nor to me.

22:02.540 --> 22:04.608
Wait.

22:04.610 --> 22:06.343
See how this road makes an "S"

22:06.345 --> 22:08.044
between the two mountain peaks?

22:08.046 --> 22:10.080
Mm-hmm.

22:10.082 --> 22:11.982
That's the border front at Hadrion Pass.

22:11.984 --> 22:14.017
- Are you sure?
- I've been there twice.

22:14.019 --> 22:18.055
This map must be from ages ago.
All the roads are different.

22:18.057 --> 22:19.724
If you're right about this, Talon,

22:19.726 --> 22:21.292
then that means that the temple is...

22:21.294 --> 22:22.905
Deep in Greyskin territory.

22:22.908 --> 22:25.329
Which is awful news.

22:25.331 --> 22:27.237
It's actually good news.

22:27.240 --> 22:29.484
The Greyskins don't care
about this book, Janzo,

22:29.487 --> 22:31.336
which means it's probably still there.

22:33.307 --> 22:35.307
- I'm going after it.
- What?

22:35.309 --> 22:37.843
Across leagues of flesh-eating
Greyskin territory?

22:37.845 --> 22:40.046
- Yes.
- I'll go.

22:40.048 --> 22:42.515
You're awake. How are you feeling?

22:42.517 --> 22:46.386
Sober. And like I just had
acid poured down my throat.

22:46.388 --> 22:49.489
That wasn't acid. Acid would
have killed you. He's so dramatic.

22:49.491 --> 22:51.687
It was dumbcane. Rodent poison.

22:51.690 --> 22:53.894
- Did it work?
- No idea.

22:53.896 --> 22:56.330
Talon, just wait.

22:56.332 --> 22:58.966
It wasn't enough to kill you.
Just enough to kill something

22:58.968 --> 23:01.135
the size of a parasite
living inside of you.

23:01.137 --> 23:03.204
Maybe. Probably not, but maybe.

23:03.206 --> 23:05.407
Janzo, do you have any idea
how to actually save me?

23:05.409 --> 23:08.376
- Close to zero.
- Right, then this is just a waste of time.

23:08.378 --> 23:11.545
- I'm going with Talon.
- So you can infect me?

23:11.548 --> 23:13.347
I don't think so. I'm going alone.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.784
No, hey, you need that book

23:14.787 --> 23:16.852
to help us defeat the Prime Order.

23:16.854 --> 23:20.323
Now, I have at least two
days. There is still time.

23:20.325 --> 23:22.191
Please, just...

23:22.193 --> 23:24.360
let me do some small good before I die.

23:24.362 --> 23:25.895
- Then I'm coming with you.
- No.

23:25.897 --> 23:27.419
I'm the only one who
can translate the script,

23:27.421 --> 23:29.533
and nobody else knows about
Plaguelings as well as I do.

23:29.535 --> 23:31.568
- You need me.
- Janzo, you don't have to come.

23:31.570 --> 23:33.904
What? I'm not letting you
go with a Plagueling alone.

23:33.906 --> 23:36.573
- Hey!
- Fine.

23:36.575 --> 23:39.110
- So when do we leave?
- Now.

23:39.112 --> 23:41.813
The longer you have me,
the further you'll get.

23:41.815 --> 23:44.749
Cocky for a dying man.

23:58.065 --> 24:00.099
Hmm. Supper.

24:09.191 --> 24:11.424
I don't understand why
we can't just walk around

24:11.426 --> 24:14.261
and walk through the
gates like normal people.

24:14.263 --> 24:16.030
Because the Outpost blocks the passage

24:16.032 --> 24:18.244
so that the Greyskins can't
get into our territory.

24:18.247 --> 24:21.369
That means we can't get into
theirs from that side either.

24:21.372 --> 24:24.305
The only way over is this wall.

24:24.307 --> 24:27.442
Garret! Wait, Garret!

24:27.444 --> 24:30.278
- Let's go.
- Garret!

24:30.280 --> 24:33.081
- You go ahead.
- No, it's all right.

24:33.083 --> 24:36.418
I... I'll just stay here w-with you!

24:39.657 --> 24:42.692
Gwynn. I was just about to leave.

24:42.694 --> 24:45.061
Why do you have to go on
this silly little trip?

24:45.063 --> 24:48.030
We should be spending our
last hours together, not apart.

24:48.032 --> 24:50.434
I am doing this for you,

24:50.436 --> 24:54.505
to help Talon get the
names to aid in your battle.

24:54.507 --> 24:56.874
Our battle.

24:56.876 --> 25:01.412
I'm sorry. Very soon it likely won't be.

25:07.788 --> 25:10.255
- It's not safe.
- I don't care.

25:17.698 --> 25:22.468
I have to go. I'm so
sorry. I have to go.

25:30.145 --> 25:31.511
Come back to me.

25:56.740 --> 25:58.073
It's a big wall.

25:59.677 --> 26:02.278
I'm surprised men could
build such a thing.

26:02.280 --> 26:04.013
Oh, men didn't build that. No, no, no.

26:04.016 --> 26:05.894
That was there before men arrived.

26:05.897 --> 26:07.667
- What? Greyskins?
- Mm-hmm.

26:07.670 --> 26:08.918
Some say Lu-Qiri.

26:08.920 --> 26:10.153
I doubt that.

26:11.623 --> 26:14.225
Forgetting your pack?

26:14.227 --> 26:15.526
Right.

26:19.198 --> 26:20.901
We've got to chain Garrett up.

26:20.904 --> 26:22.515
He could turn at any moment.

26:22.518 --> 26:23.940
It's barely been three days.

26:23.943 --> 26:25.985
We don't know exactly what
the gestation period is.

26:25.988 --> 26:29.374
He's right. It's better to be safe.

26:31.278 --> 26:32.844
Chain me up.

26:45.627 --> 26:47.560
Don't slow us down.

26:49.398 --> 26:50.731
I won't.

27:12.757 --> 27:16.225
Don't think I've ever been
more thirsty in my entire life.

27:16.227 --> 27:19.228
Hopefully one of these
days we'll get some sleep.

27:21.232 --> 27:22.831
How you feeling?

27:22.833 --> 27:24.433
Do you feel infected?

27:24.435 --> 27:29.339
Perhaps my parasite will
die of thirst before I do.

27:29.341 --> 27:31.775
It has been four days, though.

27:31.777 --> 27:35.679
You should probably sleep
with a sword tonight.

27:40.053 --> 27:42.420
I don't want to kill you.

27:45.391 --> 27:47.758
Yes, well...

27:47.760 --> 27:51.797
you may feel differently
when I'm at your throat.

28:07.649 --> 28:10.516
What is that?

28:10.518 --> 28:13.253
It's a watchtower. Looks
like an old checkpoint.

28:13.255 --> 28:17.024
I've seen one of them
before with Greyskins on it.

28:17.026 --> 28:18.525
They do have barrels, though.

28:18.527 --> 28:21.929
Was it ale or... or water?
What do Greyskins drink?

28:21.931 --> 28:23.797
Oh, whatever it is, I'm drinking it all.

28:23.799 --> 28:26.656
- It looks deserted.
- So what do we do?

28:26.659 --> 28:28.159
- We go in. Yep.
- Are you sure?

28:30.907 --> 28:32.440
I'll lead.

29:11.952 --> 29:13.552
Just dirt.

29:15.022 --> 29:16.855
Why would they be storing dirt?

29:16.857 --> 29:19.491
It's bait.

29:22.396 --> 29:24.798
Unchain me, now!

29:32.307 --> 29:34.274
Come on, come on!

29:36.579 --> 29:37.712
Sword!

30:09.820 --> 30:11.086
Aah!

30:27.400 --> 30:29.467
Ow. My ankle.

30:59.759 --> 31:01.872
What was that stuff you
dumped on the Greyskin

31:01.874 --> 31:03.140
that burned him so bad?

31:03.142 --> 31:06.844
- Acid.
- Where did you get acid from?

31:06.846 --> 31:09.346
- Brought it with me.
- Why?

31:09.348 --> 31:12.729
- It doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does.

31:12.732 --> 31:16.121
- Tell me why you brought acid.
- To try on you once you turned.

31:16.123 --> 31:19.825
It was only to see if it would
kill the Plagueling parasite.

31:19.827 --> 31:21.544
- That's all.
- So that was your plan then?

31:21.547 --> 31:23.123
Just pour acid all over me.

31:23.126 --> 31:25.330
Burn the flesh off my bones,
like you did the Greyskin.

31:25.333 --> 31:27.400
No, of course not,
Garret. Don't be so silly.

31:29.037 --> 31:31.070
I was going to pour it down your throat.

31:31.072 --> 31:33.039
- Oh.
- You would have been a goner anyway,

31:33.041 --> 31:36.043
and... and you wouldn't have felt it.

31:36.045 --> 31:37.957
I don't think. Maybe.

31:37.960 --> 31:39.713
Perhaps. I don't know.

31:39.715 --> 31:41.748
I, for one, am glad he brought acid.

31:42.780 --> 31:44.947
He saved our lives.

31:44.950 --> 31:46.784
He's my hero.

31:47.904 --> 31:50.704
Re... really?

31:53.687 --> 31:55.153
And how are you feeling?

31:55.156 --> 31:57.681
I don't feel any little
creature down my throat

31:57.684 --> 31:59.920
or stomach, if that's what you mean.

31:59.923 --> 32:02.003
Then perhaps Janzo's rat poison worked.

32:02.006 --> 32:03.138
Doubt it.

32:05.287 --> 32:07.732
Just don't tend to be
that lucky, that's all.

32:13.314 --> 32:16.382
Well, it's probably best
if you tie me up tonight.

32:16.385 --> 32:18.919
Is that what you say to all the girls?

32:30.218 --> 32:32.051
What about you? How are your ribs?

32:32.054 --> 32:34.354
Don't worry about her.

32:34.357 --> 32:37.059
She'll heal overnight.
She's Blackblood, remember?

32:37.062 --> 32:39.656
It's not that I heal
fast. You both heal slow.

32:43.017 --> 32:46.118
- Is that comfortable?
- Quite.

32:51.426 --> 32:55.495
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what?

32:55.497 --> 32:57.730
Like other men do.

32:59.948 --> 33:02.448
You know, this may be
my last night alive.

33:05.575 --> 33:08.943
Surely, Gwynn commanded
you to keep your distance.

33:08.945 --> 33:12.124
As a matter of fact...

33:12.127 --> 33:14.316
I don't believe she did.

33:24.495 --> 33:27.363
Sorry, I... I don't
want you to get infected.

33:29.313 --> 33:30.846
Oh, is that what it is?

33:44.750 --> 33:46.918
Hmm.

33:46.920 --> 33:49.185
Still don't see anything.

33:49.188 --> 33:52.255
Well, isn't he a constant
source of disappointment?

33:57.881 --> 34:00.231
You know, I am rather cold.

34:00.234 --> 34:01.700
Does that mean anything?

34:01.702 --> 34:04.937
Yes. It means it's a very harsh desert.

34:04.939 --> 34:07.573
It's burning hot in the day
and freezing cold at night.

34:07.575 --> 34:09.241
Here.

34:09.244 --> 34:10.732
Have these extra blankets.

34:19.021 --> 34:21.829
It's probably his last night alive.

34:21.831 --> 34:25.096
The least you can do is make
the pretty boy feel comfortable.

34:27.324 --> 34:29.792
Well then, I need your body warmth.

34:34.972 --> 34:38.206
You're doing this just to get
under his skin, aren't you?

34:38.208 --> 34:42.080
- What makes you say that?
- Well, is it true?

34:42.083 --> 34:45.619
'Cause if it is, it's incredibly cruel.

34:45.621 --> 34:48.089
To him or you?

34:48.092 --> 34:50.159
I'm not sure if you're aware, but, um,

34:50.161 --> 34:52.643
you're an exceptionally beautiful girl,

34:52.646 --> 34:55.190
and you're... You're pressing your...

34:55.193 --> 34:58.215
against my back.

34:59.935 --> 35:03.771
Now, I just happen to
be a male of the species,

35:03.774 --> 35:07.879
and, so, natural reactions are, um,

35:07.882 --> 35:09.923
going to be inevitable.

35:10.984 --> 35:13.184
- Did you want me to stop?
- No.

35:28.796 --> 35:32.365
- And by the way.
- Hmm?

35:32.368 --> 35:34.101
It's not only to get under his skin.

35:35.871 --> 35:37.804
I am really freezing.

35:39.835 --> 35:43.703
Right. Yes, um...

35:46.044 --> 35:48.211
It is very cold, isn't it?

36:58.076 --> 37:00.889
Milord, an army of Covenant soldiers

37:00.891 --> 37:03.308
- not a league from the gate.
- How many?

37:03.311 --> 37:06.361
I reckon ten score, with cavalry.

37:06.363 --> 37:08.263
Don't open the gates until I'm there.

37:08.265 --> 37:11.434
- Do you understand me?
- Aye. Closed.

37:11.436 --> 37:13.269
Fall in.

37:13.271 --> 37:14.537
Gwynn.

37:16.608 --> 37:17.941
Gwynn!

37:20.381 --> 37:21.582
What's going on?

37:21.585 --> 37:23.981
There's a Covenant
battalion at the gates.

37:23.983 --> 37:26.917
- You must hide.
- Have they come for me?

37:26.919 --> 37:30.321
I'm not sure. So, just
go hide, all right?

37:30.323 --> 37:31.655
All right, good.

37:39.666 --> 37:42.601
Ambassador Dred.

37:42.603 --> 37:46.005
What brings you to this
far-flung corner of the world?

37:46.007 --> 37:48.407
Commander Calkussar,

37:48.409 --> 37:50.413
why are your gates shut to me?

37:50.416 --> 37:52.612
Gates are always closed at night

37:52.614 --> 37:55.260
against our enemies, Plaguelings.

37:55.263 --> 37:58.651
But surely you do not
see us as your enemies.

37:58.654 --> 38:01.054
Of course not, Ambassador.

38:01.056 --> 38:02.689
Though I had begun to wonder

38:02.691 --> 38:05.058
when my Covenant patrol did not return.

38:05.060 --> 38:07.327
They never returned?

38:07.329 --> 38:09.497
We sent them on their way,

38:09.499 --> 38:11.833
well fed, well rested.

38:11.835 --> 38:16.070
- Did you now?
- These are dangerous lands, Ambassador.

38:16.072 --> 38:20.442
It's not uncommon for patrols
to be attacked by bandits,

38:20.444 --> 38:22.344
bone wolves, Plaguelings, and such,

38:22.346 --> 38:23.979
especially after nightfall.

38:23.981 --> 38:27.516
We have many fascinating
things to discuss, Commander.

38:27.518 --> 38:31.217
But must we shout to
one another all morning?

38:31.220 --> 38:33.356
My men are tired from their ride.

38:33.358 --> 38:37.727
Open your gates, and show us
the hospitality we deserve.

38:39.064 --> 38:41.531
Of course, Ambassador.

38:41.533 --> 38:43.400
You're always welcome here.

38:47.941 --> 38:49.374
Open the gates.

39:26.415 --> 39:28.349
We need to leave.

39:28.351 --> 39:30.217
- Pack up my things.
- What's going on?

39:30.219 --> 39:31.953
Just do as I say.

39:34.224 --> 39:38.509
Ambassador, welcome to the Outpost.

39:38.512 --> 39:40.428
My men will take care of your horses,

39:40.430 --> 39:41.837
arrange for your lodging,

39:41.840 --> 39:43.431
and perhaps you would care for...

40:02.759 --> 40:05.573
No!

40:05.737 --> 40:07.257
No!

40:07.259 --> 40:11.462
Anyone loyal to Calkussar dies today.

40:11.464 --> 40:16.601
I want Calkussar's daughter
here now, dead or alive!

40:17.699 --> 40:19.505
And find me that Blackblood!
