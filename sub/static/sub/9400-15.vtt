00:01.250 --> 00:03.610
so,about the director
-- what do you want?

00:03.670 --> 00:05.890
I want a director that
understands the characters.

00:05.960 --> 00:08.290
That's what this movie's really about.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.070
- Let's go!Come on!
- Scott...

00:14.380 --> 00:15.120
take a seat.

00:15.170 --> 00:16.660
Get comfortable,15.

00:16.730 --> 00:18.530
Get real comfortable.

00:18.910 --> 00:21.790
- Uh,is peyton around?
- No.

00:21.880 --> 00:24.440
You wouldn't by chance know how
to make a long island iced tea,wo

00:24.490 --> 00:27.480
***

00:27.680 --> 00:30.960
- *******
- yo you like her.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.509
- Do not.
- Do too.

00:32.580 --> 00:33.930
This has to be business,right?

00:34.020 --> 00:35.470
I mean,with peyton and...

00:35.530 --> 00:36.670
this should be business.

00:36.810 --> 00:39.350
We can't just -- I mean,I
kiss you,and thent gets...

00:39.390 --> 00:42.860
- definitely.It would bE...
- it would bE.

00:43.170 --> 00:44.910
Yes.

00:56.290 --> 00:59.520
Announce chiefs basketball,and
we've got a close one.

00:59.580 --> 01:03.070
The chiefs trail by one with
10 seconds left on the clock.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.810
Let's bring it in,let's bring it in.

01:04.950 --> 01:06.000
All right,huddle up!

01:06.050 --> 01:07.310
Okay,guys,this is
it -- last play.

01:07.440 --> 01:09.070
We're gonna go four-out swing rattle.

01:09.190 --> 01:12.200
Spread the defense and isolate
23 at the top of the key.

01:12.340 --> 01:14.510
Devon,you're gonna break down your maN.

01:14.580 --> 01:17.670
If you get doubled up,you hit
rhodes cutting under the basket.

01:17.780 --> 01:19.490
I got this.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.240
All right.Here we go.

01:21.340 --> 01:22.510
Everybody knows where
they're supposed to be.

01:22.550 --> 01:23.500
Let's get
"chiefs" on 3 --

01:23.610 --> 01:25.480
1,2,3.Chiefs!

01:27.400 --> 01:29.420
You know where you're supposed to be,12?

01:31.070 --> 01:33.640
Let's go! Let's go,baby!I got this!

01:36.600 --> 01:39.220
What? Aw,come on!

01:41.550 --> 01:43.520
Let's go,guys! Bring it home!

01:44.910 --> 01:46.520
Here we go.10 seconds left.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.290
Chiefs down by one.

01:50.530 --> 01:55.850
They try tget the ball to devon fox.

01:55.980 --> 01:59.930
He's got 33 points tonight.Chiefs
do get the ball inbounds.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.090
Fox has it now,dribbling on top.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.130
Four seconds lt,but fox
takes the shot instead...

02:04.200 --> 02:07.430
Seven seconds now on the cck.And
rhodes breaks free under the basket!

02:07.630 --> 02:10.009
********and it's no good!

02:10.110 --> 02:12.700
And the chiefs lose a heartbreaker.

02:26.270 --> 02:31.160
Yeah,a'ight.Now,who saw me throw down
that windmill in the third quarter,huh?

02:31.710 --> 02:33.070
It was sick!

02:33.150 --> 02:35.440
Somebody better put that on a poster.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.060
That's all I'm saying.

02:39.090 --> 02:41.130
You do realize we lost the game.

02:41.710 --> 02:42.900
No.

02:42.980 --> 02:43.960
You lost.

02:44.030 --> 02:45.580
I had 33 points.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.180
That's funny.Last time I
checked,it's a team sport.

02:49.930 --> 02:51.500
You don't get it.

02:51.540 --> 02:54.170
See,the nba only scouts
players who put up big numbers.

02:54.210 --> 02:57.110
Tonight I did that,so i won!

02:57.180 --> 03:00.220
And your ass is only here
to keep the bench warm.

03:00.290 --> 03:01.970
Oh,is that right?

03:02.040 --> 03:03.740
Yeah.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.460
Yeah,that's right.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.710
Is there a problem here?

03:09.910 --> 03:11.210
No problem.

03:11.270 --> 03:14.640
Just reminding your boy
here whose team this is.

03:17.210 --> 03:19.840
Yeah.That's what I thought.

03:19.940 --> 03:21.360
Yeah!

03:22.680 --> 03:24.640
It's devon fox's house!

03:32.460 --> 03:35.400
You know,there is this amazing
invention called the dishwasher.

03:35.470 --> 03:37.150
Yeah.It's called "mE.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.800
" Been doing it since
I was,what,jamie's age?

03:40.890 --> 03:43.390
And besides,helps me think.

03:44.220 --> 03:45.310
All right.

03:45.430 --> 03:49.040
So,besides having a pregnant
fianc,what's going on in that head?

03:49.070 --> 03:50.760
Ah,it's the movie.

03:50.830 --> 03:53.340
Julian and I have met with
five different directorS.

03:53.470 --> 03:54.770
Turned them all down.

03:55.170 --> 03:57.300
Tomorrow we're meeting with the sixth.

03:58.060 --> 04:00.680
Oh,yeah.And julian's dad's
coming to town tomorroW.

04:00.770 --> 04:03.650
Apparently,he's not happy
with how selective I've been.

04:03.850 --> 04:04.740
Okay.Well,then

04:04.850 --> 04:08.170
,maybe director number six will
be the one you've been waiting for.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.850
Well,they say he is A...

04:09.890 --> 04:11.070
visionary.

04:11.140 --> 04:12.710
That's a good thing,right?

04:12.790 --> 04:14.260
Well,yeah.

04:14.350 --> 04:17.500
Unless his vision is
different than mine.

04:17.630 --> 04:20.970
Well,this is the first five-game
losing streak of my career.

04:21.019 --> 04:22.720
I think I like winning better.

04:22.790 --> 04:25.410
You didn't lose,daddy.Those losers did!

04:26.730 --> 04:27.770
Somebody's a little fired up.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.940
Yeah.You should have
seen him 20 minutes ago.

04:30.010 --> 04:31.330
You know what,jamie?

04:31.400 --> 04:36.520
I wear that uniform just like they do,so doesn't
matter if I'm playing or not,it's still my team.

04:36.870 --> 04:39.380
We win as a team,and we lose as a teaM.

04:39.460 --> 04:41.050
Remember that,okay?

04:41.140 --> 04:42.300
Okay.

04:42.510 --> 04:44.200
All right.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.940
You okay?

04:46.390 --> 04:47.910
I am now.

04:47.970 --> 04:49.520
Good.Let's get you home.

04:57.110 --> 04:58.690
This is so wrong...

04:58.780 --> 05:01.420
but it's so right.

05:01.670 --> 05:03.330
What am I gonna tell peyton?

05:03.440 --> 05:05.680
I can't be on the couch,kissing you.

05:05.750 --> 05:11.860
Well,okay,then maybe we should just continue
thisin your bedroom,preferably without our clothes.

05:12.830 --> 05:14.680
We can'T.

05:15.360 --> 05:18.090
I gave sam a very strict "no
boys in the bedroom" policy,

05:18.160 --> 05:22.260
and I can't be one of
those hypocrite momS.

05:23.460 --> 05:26.710
Hasn't sam already broken
that rule like five times?

05:26.800 --> 05:27.920
Once.

05:27.990 --> 05:30.480
Okay,then that means you're
allowed to break it once.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.950
- It's only fair,right?
- No.

05:33.910 --> 05:37.110
That grin should be illegal.

05:38.140 --> 05:40.140
This is bad.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.990
But it's gooD.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.450
Okay.

05:53.910 --> 05:58.600
well,just so I'm clear on these newly amended
rules,I'm not allowed to have boys in the bedroom,

05:58.670 --> 06:01.760
but it's okay if I fool around
with them out here on the coucH.

06:01.860 --> 06:03.710
Is that correct?

06:03.780 --> 06:06.330
I think you should repeal the
"no boys in the bedroom" rule.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.540
You stay out of this.

06:07.620 --> 06:09.460
I'm with juliaN.

06:09.940 --> 06:11.380
You're killing me,sam.

06:11.460 --> 06:12.930
I know.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.600
I'llave my headphones
on tonight,just in case.

06:17.670 --> 06:19.150
Good night.

06:21.020 --> 06:23.090
Oh,my god.

06:23.170 --> 06:24.610
It's not funny!

06:24.670 --> 06:29.700
Okay.Okay,maybe we should just continue
this in your bedroom,preferably...

06:29.860 --> 06:31.140
without our clothes.

06:31.250 --> 06:32.920
Yeah.

06:33.380 --> 06:35.140
RighT.

06:42.130 --> 06:44.060
Should I be following you?

06:47.240 --> 06:49.240
I'll just let myself out.

06:54.060 --> 06:56.000
Tell me what you see.

06:57.190 --> 07:01.170
Where is the soul
hidden within this image?

07:04.450 --> 07:06.460
I don't know what that means.

07:06.540 --> 07:08.530
I think he's talking to himself.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.920
I'm just curious,but what the
hell are we doing in a junkyard?

07:13.370 --> 07:15.130
There.

07:15.220 --> 07:17.040
That's lucas' house.

07:17.950 --> 07:19.150
It's perfect.

07:19.210 --> 07:21.710
No,no.It's,uh...

07:21.880 --> 07:23.740
I didn't grow up here.

07:23.820 --> 07:26.930
You know,I-I actually
had a pretty normal house.

07:27.040 --> 07:30.030
Boring!There's no drama in "normal.

07:30.100 --> 07:32.240
" I'm going for "8
mile" here.I want gritty.

07:32.300 --> 07:37.340
I'm thinking the entire movie should
be shot with a handheld camera.

07:37.470 --> 07:40.630
Look,pete,we want to keep
in mind this is a true story.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.800
You know,it's okay to have
a vision -- we love that.

07:43.940 --> 07:46.300
We -- we just don't want
to rewrite history herE.

07:48.270 --> 07:51.660
This is the only place I can see
our climactic scene happening!

07:51.730 --> 07:58.360
This is the spot where lucas' rival gang
kills his uncle keith in a drive-by shooting!

07:58.930 --> 08:00.190
Okay.

08:00.290 --> 08:02.150
I'm done here.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.380
So,doc,tell me the truth.

08:12.640 --> 08:15.100
What are the chances of another
heart becoming available?

08:16.230 --> 08:18.500
Same as they were
before -- not great.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.660
Well,that's comforting.

08:20.750 --> 08:21.990
Don't give up pe.

08:22.050 --> 08:25.990
Just remember,even with those odds the
last time,we were able to find you a hearT.

08:26.070 --> 08:27.860
And it ended up going to someone elsE.

08:27.950 --> 08:29.160
Yes.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.040
It saved a man's lifE.

08:31.170 --> 08:35.100
Well,we could just ask for
it back,tell him we had dibs.

08:35.530 --> 08:37.299
I'm afraid not.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.320
Didn't think so.

08:45.630 --> 08:47.700
I said,"shut up!

08:49.540 --> 08:51.090
Just do yourself a favor.

08:51.140 --> 08:53.230
Thisime when it goes off,call us.

08:53.290 --> 08:54.860
Okay.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.740
I'll try to avoid being
kidnapped by some crazy bitcH.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.010
All you can do now is waiT.

09:09.110 --> 09:12.080
Devon makes that pass,we win the game.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.500
Maybe.

09:16.380 --> 09:18.890
I wanted to talk to
you about playing time.

09:20.010 --> 09:21.730
Nathan,you've been he five minutes.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.820
You're still learning the
offense,not to mention a new position.

09:24.900 --> 09:26.330
I know.

09:26.430 --> 09:29.630
And if the team were winning,we
wouldn't be having this conversatioN.

09:30.260 --> 09:32.970
You play the same position as
the best player on this teaM.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.810
Devon scored 33 points last night.

09:34.880 --> 09:39.740
And he had one assist,and that was
off of an air ball they called a pass.

09:39.830 --> 09:42.370
Look,the job of the point guard is
to get the rest of the team involved.

09:42.420 --> 09:46.970
So,unless he learns to pass the
ball,this team's gonna keep losinG.

09:46.970 --> 09:48.890
I-I've seen it beforE.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.320
You know what you
sounded like just then?

09:51.500 --> 09:53.540
A coacH.

09:53.730 --> 09:56.150
But you turned down that job,remember?

09:56.950 --> 09:59.360
Just gonna have  wait your turn,natE.

10:05.340 --> 10:06.740
Here.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.390
Take this.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.600
That's some of our new offensive sets.

10:10.690 --> 10:14.730
We'll see how they sink in,then maybe
we'll talk about some playing time.

10:15.010 --> 10:17.400
My number's in there if
you have any questionS.

10:17.590 --> 10:19.520
Yeah.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.620
Thanks,coacH.

10:29.330 --> 10:30.740
Is that a new hat?

10:30.830 --> 10:32.410
Yeah.Why?

10:33.100 --> 10:34.270
No reason.

10:34.370 --> 10:36.550
Am I not pulling it off?

10:36.660 --> 10:37.930
Nah,it's fine.

10:37.990 --> 10:41.300
No.If it was fine,you wouldn't have
mentioned it.It would just blend in.

10:44.930 --> 10:46.040
Okay.

10:46.110 --> 10:47.360
Let's hear it.

10:47.470 --> 10:49.270
What was wro with this director?

10:49.370 --> 10:53.020
- Too short?Too tl?
- Too idiot.

10:55.010 --> 10:56.510
This is getting old,lucas.

10:56.610 --> 10:57.690
No,dad.Lucas is right.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.520
This guy was not a good fit.

10:59.600 --> 11:03.720
Julian,you've been calling me "paul" since you
were 15,so don't start withhe "dad" crap noW.

11:03.780 --> 11:04.910
Lucas: All right,look.

11:04.980 --> 11:08.440
These directors that you've sent us --
they are all extremely talented,all right?

11:08.500 --> 11:11.980
They are.They're just not
what we're looking for.

11:13.250 --> 11:14.960
Well,I'm sorry to hear that.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.010
It's time for me to step in.

11:17.080 --> 11:20.390
I have sent you six directors.Any
one of them could make this movie.

11:20.470 --> 11:21.950
So it's real simple.

11:22.030 --> 11:23.460
Pick one.

11:23.520 --> 11:24.500
I don't care which one it iS.

11:24.630 --> 11:29.290
Because if you don't,then I'm gonna
take that stupid hat off of julian's head

11:29.390 --> 11:31.290
and I'm gonna put all
six choices inside of it

11:31.360 --> 11:34.400
and I'm gonna reach in and I'm
gonna choose your director for yoU.

11:34.960 --> 11:39.350
Now,if you don't like that idea,you have
until tomorrow to decide for yourself.

11:39.420 --> 11:41.300
Understood?

11:54.700 --> 11:57.890
I'l trstilying to figure out how I
ended up with such a talented wife.

11:57.970 --> 12:00.030
You just got lucky.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.640
No.Getting lucky's how I got a soN.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.630
So,how'd it go with the coach?

12:07.670 --> 12:09.880
It looks like I won't
be playing any time soon.

12:10.110 --> 12:11.800
Aw.Sorry,natE.

12:11.810 --> 12:13.130
It's okay.

12:13.180 --> 12:15.790
I think you and jamie should
skip the next few games,though.

12:15.830 --> 12:17.190
I don't want to let him down.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.590
Let him down?You're his hero.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.660
Exactly.I...

12:23.810 --> 12:26.720
it can't be easy to watch
your hero sit on the bench.

12:27.110 --> 12:30.700
Maybe we go to those games to
support you,whether you play or noT.

12:30.780 --> 12:34.510
And besides,I think it's important
for our son to see you not giving uP.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.410
Maybe you're right.

12:36.510 --> 12:38.200
I am.

12:38.970 --> 12:41.400
Besides,we're a team,right?

12:41.480 --> 12:44.200
We win together,and we lose together.

12:46.510 --> 12:47.940
Right.

12:56.430 --> 12:58.280
Where did you disappear to last night?

12:58.310 --> 13:00.300
I was waiting for you in my bed.

13:00.410 --> 13:02.650
- That's not funny.
- Yes,t is.

13:02.710 --> 13:03.830
Check it out.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.430
For the movie.What do you think?

13:05.530 --> 13:06.810
Very authentic.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.610
Well,not yet.

13:08.680 --> 13:11.240
I have to age them down a little
and put some patches on them,

13:11.280 --> 13:14.280
but I've had some experience
with letterman jackets.

13:14.400 --> 13:15.820
I'm sure you havE.

13:15.900 --> 13:20.320
Oh,like you didn't have all the girls in
your high school just begging to wear yours?

13:20.360 --> 13:22.100
No,I didn't play sports in high school.

13:22.150 --> 13:23.950
I never had a letterman jacket.

13:23.990 --> 13:25.420
Really?

13:25.520 --> 13:27.080
Well...

13:27.150 --> 13:28.900
now you do.

13:30.550 --> 13:32.830
- Did you make this for me?
- Yep.

13:32.900 --> 13:33.960
And look at that.

13:34.010 --> 13:36.260
You lettered all four years in footbalL.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.780
Not bad for someone
who never played sports.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.680
Thanks,brooke.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.630
You're welcome.

13:44.540 --> 13:45.760
I'll see you later.

13:45.850 --> 13:47.210
Okay.

13:51.770 --> 13:53.290
Really,brooke?

13:53.390 --> 13:55.110
What?You two are totally having sex!

13:55.150 --> 13:56.380
No,we're not.

13:56.430 --> 13:58.300
You so are!I can sense it!

13:58.380 --> 14:01.940
Well,then,your senses are
off,because we are not having sex.

14:02.060 --> 14:04.640
And how much would
you hate me if we were?

14:04.730 --> 14:06.130
No,I wouldn't hate you.

14:06.180 --> 14:08.060
I mean,I know how he is.He's
smart,and he's charming,

14:08.140 --> 14:11.650
and he gets into a lot of beds with
that little scoundrel grin of hiS.

14:11.700 --> 14:13.450
Yeah,I know that grin.

14:13.510 --> 14:16.170
All right,well,there's
something else you should know.

14:16.490 --> 14:21.130
The weekend that he broke up with me,he
just jumped into bed with somebody else,okay?

14:21.200 --> 14:26.860
He flew off to sundance,slept with some actress
before I could even wipe away the tears,you know?

14:26.930 --> 14:28.550
It was all in the tabloids.

14:28.620 --> 14:31.440
And that's when I realized
what a bad guy he is.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.770
You know,I just couldn't
figure it out until then.

14:33.820 --> 14:36.130
So I want you to be careful,all right?

14:36.200 --> 14:41.360
'Cause the second this movie's over,he's gonna
be off on another movie with a new conquest.

14:41.450 --> 14:46.850
And before you know it,that charming
guy with the sweet grin disappears.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.300
That's just who he iS.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.150
*******

14:58.770 --> 15:00.950
what are you doing?

15:01.530 --> 15:03.930
Haley,will you marry me?

15:03.990 --> 15:06.930
That is so creepy on so many levels.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.010
Yeah,well,that's how that,uh,crazy
director in L.A.Wanted to end the movie.

15:11.130 --> 15:12.610
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

15:12.810 --> 15:15.100
Do you think peyton will like it?

15:18.090 --> 15:21.280
I don't know,luke.Girls usually
hate getting big diamonds.

15:23.540 --> 15:25.250
I think she'll love it.

15:25.320 --> 15:29.330
It's just,i...I always pictured
you giving her keith's rinG.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.510
It meant so much to you.

15:31.590 --> 15:34.780
The truth is,is I always
hoped she'd wear that ring,too.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.980
So why did you buy this one?

15:37.050 --> 15:40.200
Well,because I gave
keith's ring to lindseY.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.860
She gave it back to you.

15:41.950 --> 15:44.420
Yeah.I just wasn't sure if
she'd want it after that.

15:44.540 --> 15:47.850
So I figured,you know,couldn't
go wrong with a new ring.

15:48.140 --> 15:49.330
All right.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.040
Oh,luke,it's stuck.

15:51.270 --> 15:53.790
Well,I guess I'll just
have to keep it now.Sorry.

16:03.720 --> 16:05.290
Did you forget something?

16:05.350 --> 16:07.970
No.I just couldn't stay away.

16:09.780 --> 16:11.000
Is everything okay?

16:11.090 --> 16:12.490
YeS.

16:13.010 --> 16:15.240
No.I don't know.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.030
Well,which is it -- "yes,"
"no," or,"I don't know"?

16:17.110 --> 16:19.040
I don't know.

16:19.870 --> 16:25.720
Look,the last thing that I want to do is make it
awkward between us,but I need to know somethinG.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.120
Is this going anywhere?

16:28.190 --> 16:30.990
This conversation?I have
no idea.I'm completely lost.

16:31.070 --> 16:33.520
I'm being serious,juliaN.

16:33.630 --> 16:38.160
This -- you and me -- what
are we -- what are we doing?

16:40.420 --> 16:43.540
I don't know.We're hanging
ouT.We're having fun.

16:43.780 --> 16:45.530
Right.

16:45.790 --> 16:47.500
Pretty much what I
expected your answer to be.

16:47.570 --> 16:49.240
What's wrong with having fun?

16:49.300 --> 16:50.750
NothinG.

16:50.830 --> 16:54.580
And in the past,I would
have been fine with a fling.

16:54.670 --> 16:57.990
And I'm sorry that you missed
out on that version of me.

16:58.030 --> 16:59.750
But my situation has changed.

16:59.790 --> 17:03.690
I'm really trying to set
a good example for sam,

17:03.740 --> 17:09.230
and I just don't know how to
explain "just having fun" to her.

17:09.310 --> 17:12.020
So this is about sam.

17:12.510 --> 17:14.500
Sam,me...

17:14.589 --> 17:16.190
Peyton?

17:17.680 --> 17:19.790
Does it really matter?

17:19.920 --> 17:22.880
I mean,we both know you're gonna
leave when the movie's oveR.

17:24.119 --> 17:25.950
There it is.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.110
Okay.

17:29.200 --> 17:33.880
Well,maybe we should just slow
it down,focus on the movie.

17:34.780 --> 17:37.570
And by "slow down," you
mean "slam on the brakeS.

17:37.630 --> 17:41.360
"Brooke,it sounds to me like you slammed
on the brakes before I came in here.

17:41.910 --> 17:44.830
But you know what?It's
okay.Whatever you want it to be.

17:52.690 --> 17:54.550
What's that,grandpa?

17:55.310 --> 17:58.530
That's the thing that makes noise
when it's time for me to get better.

17:58.990 --> 18:01.590
When is it supposed to make the noise?

18:01.950 --> 18:03.760
Wish I knew.

18:03.830 --> 18:05.310
Me too.

18:05.380 --> 18:07.440
So,tell me,how's your dad?

18:07.670 --> 18:10.720
He finally made the team,but
he never gets to play.

18:10.810 --> 18:12.300
The team's not very good.

18:12.470 --> 18:15.230
- They always lose.
- Well,that's okaY.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.770
He always rises to the top,you know?

18:17.890 --> 18:21.270
It's not just about x's and o'S.It's about
heart,and your dad has plenty of that.

18:21.340 --> 18:22.860
So don't worry.

18:23.450 --> 18:24.600
Did you hear that?

18:24.750 --> 18:26.560
I think it made a sounD.

18:26.630 --> 18:28.360
Not just yet,buddy.

18:28.450 --> 18:30.680
But when it does,you'll
be the first to know.

18:32.860 --> 18:34.930
- Eat your ice cream.
- Okay.

18:44.770 --> 18:46.320
I want to play a song for you.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.780
Cool.Let's hear it.

18:47.830 --> 18:49.670
But this is good,too.

18:52.360 --> 18:54.480
All right.I'm gonna go sit over therE...

18:54.780 --> 18:56.560
in a seconD.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.910
Go play me your song,goof.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.220
Okay.

19:10.510 --> 19:12.260
So,I'm a little nervous.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.010
I thought you did this for a living.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.820
Yeah,but this is different.No
one's ever heard this before.

19:17.520 --> 19:20.280
So I'm gonna be your first.

19:20.380 --> 19:21.680
We'll see.

19:23.750 --> 19:27.680
So,remember when we were talking the
other night about flying over a city

19:27.760 --> 19:30.270
and how things look
different from a distance?

19:30.380 --> 19:32.650
Well,you kind of
inspired me to write this.

19:32.890 --> 19:37.220
So,promise you'll lie and say
you love it if you hate it.

19:37.290 --> 19:38.360
I can do that.

19:38.420 --> 19:40.280
I can be a good liar for you.

19:40.660 --> 19:42.750
Well,hopefully,you won't have to be.

20:00.670 --> 20:02.620
we're stopping.Why are we stopping?

20:02.840 --> 20:04.500
Look where we are.

20:06.270 --> 20:08.790
Luke,it's our spot.

20:13.090 --> 20:15.830
We haven't been here in years!

20:15.910 --> 20:17.390
I have.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.900
When you were in L.A.,I
used to come here sometimes.

20:21.060 --> 20:23.570
We're using this as a
location in the movie.

20:23.670 --> 20:25.420
Pretty good moment in our relationshiP.

20:25.510 --> 20:27.250
Yeah.It was the beginning.

20:27.290 --> 20:29.670
You were so cute in
your little tow truck.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.350
Yeah,and you were so mean to me.

20:31.420 --> 20:34.880
Remember?Irst of all,you don't know mE.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.900
" "Second of all,you don't know mE.

20:38.160 --> 20:39.920
" And in my defense,you
really didn't know mE.

20:39.990 --> 20:42.230
Oh,yes,I did.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.250
I always knew you.

20:46.010 --> 20:48.270
I have something for you.

20:48.790 --> 20:53.570
Now,we're already engaged,so I don't know if
I'm supposed to get down on one knee,but...

20:54.940 --> 20:56.600
oh,myod.

20:56.390 --> 20:58.870
- Is that for me?
- YeS.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.890
Do you like it?

21:01.990 --> 21:04.090
Like it? It's beautiful.

21:12.750 --> 21:15.480
I am so glad you always knew me.

21:31.300 --> 21:34.430
It's a good thing to see you
haven't lost your shooting toucH.

21:36.020 --> 21:38.530
So,I heard your team's
lost five straighT.

21:38.890 --> 21:41.240
I know how that feels.

21:41.740 --> 21:43.730
Actually,I don'T.

21:44.090 --> 21:46.130
Did you come here just to rub it in?

21:46.210 --> 21:49.670
No.I came to tell you that
losing has its advantages.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.140
Here we go.

21:52.190 --> 21:56.080
Some classic dan scott advice that
doesn't apply to normal people.

21:56.550 --> 21:58.670
I'm all ears.What do you got for me?

21:59.700 --> 22:02.160
Losing always forces change,nathan.

22:02.270 --> 22:03.910
Your time's coming.

22:03.950 --> 22:05.820
I don't know about thaT.

22:05.950 --> 22:08.390
Best guy on the team
plays in front of me.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.460
Oh,you know what i call the
best player on a losing team.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.700
- A loser.
- Bingo.A loser.

22:13.740 --> 22:17.160
Right now,you're playing on his team,but
pretty soon,he's gonna be playing on yours.

22:17.690 --> 22:19.360
I'm not so sure about that.

22:19.440 --> 22:22.360
You're gonna get your
chance,nathan.We both know that.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.960
The thing is,when you
do,will you be ready?

22:26.410 --> 22:28.890
Will you make the most of it?

22:30.380 --> 22:31.890
See this?

22:31.960 --> 22:35.110
This thing's gonna decide whether
or not I get a second chancE.

22:35.180 --> 22:37.240
And I promise you...

22:37.800 --> 22:40.150
If I do,I'm gonna make the most of it.

22:44.950 --> 22:48.930
Right now,all you can do is wait.

23:00.190 --> 23:02.240
Can I help you?

23:02.940 --> 23:04.560
Paul!

23:04.650 --> 23:08.030
Oh,god,I was hoping I was gonna
see you while you were in town!

23:08.090 --> 23:09.190
Your assistant let me in.

23:09.330 --> 23:10.770
- My assistant?
- Yeah,mia.

23:10.820 --> 23:12.000
Cute little brunette.

23:12.060 --> 23:13.410
Oh,god,no.That's not my assistanT.

23:13.490 --> 23:16.810
That,um -- that is just an
overly trusting recording artist.

23:16.870 --> 23:18.680
It's a good thing you're
not a serial killer.

23:18.740 --> 23:20.450
We actually have those
here in tree hill.

23:20.530 --> 23:21.900
I heard.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.340
So,look at you.

23:23.430 --> 23:26.200
You've become this big success.

23:26.250 --> 23:28.310
And most importantly,you look happy.

23:28.380 --> 23:30.740
I'm kind of having a good day.

23:30.860 --> 23:32.620
Not bad.

23:32.700 --> 23:35.670
Lucas has good taste
in jewelry and fianc.

23:35.750 --> 23:38.190
His taste in directors,however,is
still in question.

23:38.290 --> 23:40.570
I am staying way out of that argument.

23:40.650 --> 23:42.860
That's probably a good ideA.

23:43.170 --> 23:45.130
It's good to see you,peyton.

23:45.230 --> 23:47.020
How long has it been?

23:47.080 --> 23:48.330
I mean...

23:48.400 --> 23:50.060
I mean,it was before sundance.

23:50.170 --> 23:53.620
Um,god,that was hard to forgeT.I
spent that whole weekend crying.

23:54.520 --> 24:01.280
You know,my son has made a few mistakes in his
life,but letting you get away easily tops the list.

24:01.550 --> 24:03.970
The breakup was not hard
on julian.He was fine.

24:04.040 --> 24:08.470
In fact,I remember reading about him and that little
a-list actress of his that weekend in sundance.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.640
Peyton,you can't believe everything
you read in hollywood -- you know that.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.890
Paul,are you covering for him?

24:16.210 --> 24:20.030
Actually,no,because
I planted that story.

24:20.420 --> 24:22.020
I was trying to promote a movie.

24:22.080 --> 24:24.180
Julian didn't even go to sundance.

24:24.250 --> 24:27.220
He skipped his own movie
premiere,he was so heartbroken.

24:27.320 --> 24:30.700
To be honest,I'm not sure
he's ever fully recovereD.

24:30.780 --> 24:33.070
Nice digs you got here.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.120
do you really think one of
these guys can make this movie?

24:44.930 --> 24:46.190
They can all make the movie.

24:46.240 --> 24:49.620
The question is,which one of
them will screw it up the least.

24:49.770 --> 24:51.250
So that's our goal here?

24:51.310 --> 24:52.510
Find the best of the worst,huh?

24:52.580 --> 24:54.330
That is the plan,yeS.

24:54.390 --> 24:57.110
Fair enough.So,who's your first choice?

24:57.180 --> 24:59.640
All right,hear me out,'cause you're
gonna think I'm a little crazy,

24:59.700 --> 25:01.350
but I got to go with
the british director.

25:01.450 --> 25:02.530
Really?

25:02.590 --> 25:05.260
The guy made an incest
movie with sock puppets.

25:05.290 --> 25:08.000
Yeah,but you got to admit,it
had a certain style to it.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.100
And tell me you wouldn't want to
see a little sock-puppet lucas.

25:11.130 --> 25:13.030
Come on,admit it.

25:19.970 --> 25:21.340
Whatcha doing,daddy?

25:21.420 --> 25:23.070
Just doing a little homework.

25:23.190 --> 25:24.720
There's homework in bastball?

25:24.820 --> 25:26.290
Sure,there is.

25:26.330 --> 25:28.770
When I g on the court,I
want to be ready,right?

25:29.890 --> 25:31.900
Do you think you're ever gonna play?

25:32.020 --> 25:33.410
I hope so.

25:33.470 --> 25:35.740
It's up to the coach,though.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.010
Is he mean?

25:38.070 --> 25:40.320
No,he's not mean.He's just...

25:40.410 --> 25:42.850
just doing what he thinks
is best for the team.

25:45.340 --> 25:47.400
You know what?I have an idea.

25:47.450 --> 25:50.320
Why don't you help me learn some of
these plays?I could really use your helP.

25:50.380 --> 25:51.920
Really?Okay,I'll help.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.440
Awesome.Come here.

25:53.510 --> 25:54.590
All right,see this play?

25:54.660 --> 25:56.840
That's called a four-out
swing rattle,all right?

25:56.890 --> 26:01.380
- That's when four players
- so,you can't play until the coach wants you to?

26:01.630 --> 26:02.710
Yeah.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.930
I just have to wait until then.

26:05.250 --> 26:10.100
All right.So,this play,I'm just gonna come
down here,and I'm going to dribble this way.

26:14.150 --> 26:15.190
I want one of thosE.

26:15.240 --> 26:19.520
Well,I will make you one,but
you are just gonna have to wait.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.320
Julian didn't have to wait.

26:23.730 --> 26:26.300
Is that what he told you --
that I didn't make him wait?

26:26.450 --> 26:30.390
No,I came to tluconcsion when
he showed me his new jacket.

26:31.390 --> 26:32.990
Right.

26:33.060 --> 26:37.950
- Brooke,are you and julian
- no,not at all.

26:38.780 --> 26:44.800
Okay,up until today,we were "having fun --" his
words,not mine -- but it ended before it started.

26:45.430 --> 26:47.110
He didn't tell you?

26:47.180 --> 26:48.520
No.

26:48.590 --> 26:52.700
Since I don't really like julian,we try to
keep our conversations strictly aut the movie.

26:52.800 --> 26:55.590
Right. How is that going?

26:55.710 --> 27:01.980
Oh,well,the director I met today wanted to make lucas
a gang member and have him living in a junkyard.Yeah.

27:02.140 --> 27:03.400
Sounds gritty?

27:03.500 --> 27:06.310
Oh,but he did want to put
brooke in a mansion in charlotte.

27:06.370 --> 27:09.520
Now,that is a movie I would go see.

27:13.810 --> 27:15.600
Luke...

27:15.700 --> 27:19.810
you don't have to compromise,not
if you don't want to.

27:19.890 --> 27:25.770
The worst thing that could happen is for this movie
to fail because they went with someone else's vision.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.870
What do I do,brooke?

27:29.930 --> 27:31.860
Do whatever it takes.

27:31.920 --> 27:35.570
Just make sure they tell the
story the way you remember it.

27:38.660 --> 27:40.640
- Come in!
- Mama,I need to use the phone.

27:40.700 --> 27:43.760
Well,okay,but who are
you calling,little man?

27:44.310 --> 27:45.950
Guess what I'm holding!

27:45.990 --> 27:47.250
It looks like a cd.

27:47.300 --> 27:49.240
Oh,it is,but what's on it?

27:49.330 --> 27:50.590
Barry manilow.

27:50.670 --> 27:51.980
It's mia's new song.

27:52.060 --> 27:53.940
Since when does mia have a new song?

27:53.970 --> 27:55.990
Since now.It's great.

27:56.060 --> 27:57.790
Give it!

27:57.900 --> 27:59.460
Hi,this is jat.

27:59.530 --> 28:01.130
E scot we need to talk.

28:01.260 --> 28:03.320
Oh,I see lucas gave you the ring!

28:03.400 --> 28:04.660
What,you knew about it?

28:04.830 --> 28:08.500
Yeah.He proposed to me with it
first,but I just had to turn him down.

28:08.580 --> 28:10.530
Lucky me.

28:10.620 --> 28:12.910
Well,it's definitely beautiful.

28:13.250 --> 28:15.370
You don't sound very convincing.

28:15.450 --> 28:16.730
No,I love it.

28:16.780 --> 28:17.930
I dO.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.630
I just -- I always envisioned
wearing keith's ring.

28:23.410 --> 28:26.800
Okay,I'm gonna tell you something,and you
have to swear that you did not hear it from mE.

28:26.870 --> 28:28.570
I promise.

28:28.640 --> 28:31.400
Lucas really wanted to
give you keith's ring.

28:31.510 --> 28:35.520
He just thought you wouldn't want it
since he already gave it to lindsey.

28:35.660 --> 28:38.270
So,you see,it's not
all about x's and o'S.

28:38.340 --> 28:39.750
It's about heart.

28:39.850 --> 28:42.780
I just think you should
really think about that.

28:44.700 --> 28:46.350
I will.

28:46.450 --> 28:48.250
You have a good night,jamie.

28:54.590 --> 28:58.380
- I thought we agreed on the bri
- well,I changed my min

28:58.420 --> 29:00.540
well,paul wants an answer today.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.090
He'll get one.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.920
Well,what are we gonna tell him?

29:04.010 --> 29:06.170
I haven't exactly
figured that out yet,okay?

29:06.280 --> 29:10.990
Oh,okay.Well,when you do figure it
out,I'm only the producer of the movie.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.540
Who's this?

29:18.140 --> 29:19.710
You've got to be kidding me.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.810
Lucas scott,you son of a bitch!

29:22.890 --> 29:24.210
Thanks,argyle.Hang tight.

29:24.290 --> 29:25.770
- My name is jason.
- Rent "die hard.

29:25.850 --> 29:27.150
" It'll change your life.

29:27.210 --> 29:28.490
What are you doing here,adam?

29:28.560 --> 29:32.690
My agent tells me you guys are still having
some trouble finding a director for this movie.

29:32.870 --> 29:36.060
I thought maybe I would come by and
give you two dorks another chance.

29:37.330 --> 29:40.010
I have a surprise for you.

29:40.100 --> 29:41.590
Voil?

29:41.660 --> 29:43.900
Think I finally perfted
the long island iced tea.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.780
That took a little longer
than it should havE.

29:46.840 --> 29:48.100
Just sayinG.

29:48.150 --> 29:50.040
Promise me one thing?

29:50.120 --> 29:53.030
Even if you hate it,you'll
lie and say you love iT.

29:53.110 --> 29:54.600
Okay.

30:01.710 --> 30:03.190
It's good.

30:03.230 --> 30:04.730
Not greaT.

30:05.730 --> 30:07.780
I'm just kidding.I love iT.

30:07.880 --> 30:13.710
But I'm also underage,and before I get you arrested,I
think you should probably get back to the baR...

30:15.530 --> 30:17.600
...right after I kiss you again.

30:22.840 --> 30:24.790
I think you've perfected that,toO.

30:24.870 --> 30:25.990
Okay.

30:26.020 --> 30:28.040
I know what you guys are thinking.

30:28.090 --> 30:30.540
You're thinking about fast
food,beer,and getting laid.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.180
That's pretty much what i was thinking.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.920
It's like he read my mind.

30:33.990 --> 30:35.290
I respect that!

30:35.360 --> 30:36.630
I do.I respect that.

30:36.650 --> 30:39.660
But you guys are also
thinking about your movie.

30:39.710 --> 30:43.790
And I didn't fly all the way out here just so I
could nail some flight attendant on the plane...

30:43.850 --> 30:45.840
even though I did that.

30:45.900 --> 30:47.050
[ Laughs ] How'd she look?

30:47.120 --> 30:49.040
Solid six,but that's not important.

30:49.090 --> 30:51.390
What important...

30:51.600 --> 30:54.140
is why I should be directing this film.

30:54.180 --> 30:57.350
Now,lucas,you wrote a good
script,but that's not enough.

30:57.670 --> 30:59.780
What you two need
is a director --

30:59.840 --> 31:04.930
someone who can take your vision and
translate it onto the big screen,baby!

31:04.960 --> 31:09.850
A director who knows when a scene isn't
working,a director who can adapt to any situation.

31:09.910 --> 31:13.180
Gentlemen,that's what i do.

31:13.920 --> 31:16.000
That's what I know.

31:16.470 --> 31:21.210
Bottom line -- the three of us are gonna get
more ass than a toilet seat in yankee stadiuM.

31:23.290 --> 31:25.180
Are you finished?

31:25.250 --> 31:26.950
Depends if I have the job or not.

31:27.020 --> 31:28.900
Okay,um...

31:29.100 --> 31:33.000
let me tell you why you're
not gonna direct this moviE.

31:33.030 --> 31:37.250
Because you can't
identify with this world.

31:37.320 --> 31:42.980
I mean,I want a director who
can re-create the feeling that

31:43.020 --> 31:47.100
i get every time I step out
onto the river court at night.

31:47.180 --> 31:49.910
I want someone who can
explain to the audience

31:50.030 --> 31:55.020
why one song can instantly
change peyton's mood,

31:55.090 --> 31:58.980
someone who can recognize that there are two
completely different sides to brooke davis,

31:59.050 --> 32:02.690
both of which are amazing.

32:05.510 --> 32:11.210
I want a director who can make
the little thingsthe big things.

32:13.410 --> 32:16.440
And you are just not the guy to do that.

32:27.260 --> 32:28.940
I suck.

32:28.990 --> 32:31.040
True,but why this time?

32:31.090 --> 32:34.480
Okay,all that stuff that
I told you about julian --

32:34.510 --> 32:38.580
I just found out that some of my
facts were not entirely accurate.

32:38.610 --> 32:40.860
Like which facts?

32:41.100 --> 32:43.120
Pretty much all of theM.

32:43.150 --> 32:46.170
He didn't go and sleep with some
other girl the weekend we broke up.

32:46.220 --> 32:48.810
In fact,he missed his
own movie premiere.

32:48.830 --> 32:54.450
So it seems there is a possibility that julian
really is the nice guy I thought he was after all.

32:54.490 --> 32:58.540
Well,thank you for that,but none
of that changes the fact that

32:58.630 --> 33:02.010
you and I have been through way too
much for me to violate the girl code now.

33:02.060 --> 33:04.810
Oh,my god,brooke."Girl code"?

33:04.880 --> 33:06.680
I'm engaged to your ex-boyfriend.

33:06.730 --> 33:11.470
You are so exempt from the
girl code,it's not even funny.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.220
Nathan: Hey,devon,you got a second?

33:16.320 --> 33:18.790
Want an autograph,12,wait
till after the game.

33:18.910 --> 33:20.550
You're going heads-up
with alex beck tonight.

33:20.620 --> 33:23.040
He's a good defender.Quick ndS.

33:23.090 --> 33:24.470
I'm gonna eat that fool up.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.780
I hope so,but he's leading
the league in steals.

33:27.830 --> 33:29.980
You usually go right off the dribble.

33:30.050 --> 33:32.030
He's gonna be ready for that.

33:32.230 --> 33:33.830
Are you giving me tips?

33:33.900 --> 33:35.340
I'm just trying to
give you an advantage.

33:35.390 --> 33:37.150
I already got an advantage.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.540
It's called my god-given talent.

33:39.680 --> 33:43.200
So go sit on the bench
and enjoy the show.

33:43.270 --> 33:44.480
Okay.

33:44.550 --> 33:45.890
You do your thinG.

33:45.950 --> 33:49.930
But after he picks your pocket a few
times,you might want to switch to your left.

34:00.310 --> 34:02.620
So,who's the lucky one,lucas?

34:02.680 --> 34:07.600
Well,first off,I just want you to know
that we have given this a lot of thought.

34:07.740 --> 34:11.719
That being said,we've
decided to choosE...

34:12.560 --> 34:14.590
none of them.

34:14.730 --> 34:16.659
Not the answer that I wanted to hear.

34:16.690 --> 34:18.350
I know.

34:18.750 --> 34:20.320
So you know what I have to do now,right?

34:20.340 --> 34:24.320
Look,I just -- I just
believe we can do better.

34:24.469 --> 34:28.219
That may be true,but time's up.

34:30.500 --> 34:33.460
Well,this feels like
d?vu all over again.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.170
We're all tied up.Nine seconds left.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.750
Let's bring it in.Let's bring it in.

34:36.790 --> 34:37.800
This is it.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.830
Time's up.Tie game.Last play.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.040
Here's what we're gonna do.

34:41.110 --> 34:43.090
Rhodes,set a high scree for devon.

34:43.159 --> 34:47.270
Hit your spot.Devon,you're gonna find rhodes
cutting across the lane.You get him the ball.

34:47.340 --> 34:49.170
Wait.You're calling the play for rhodes?

34:49.199 --> 34:51.190
Devon,everybody in the building
thinks you're taking the last shot.

34:51.230 --> 34:52.469
That's because I am!

34:52.500 --> 34:53.969
I'm here to put the ball in the basket.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.500
You're here to help this team wiN.

34:55.540 --> 34:56.949
Whatever.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.950
Look,I'm taking the lost
shot,or I'm taking a seat.

35:00.190 --> 35:02.260
Your call.

35:04.240 --> 35:05.300
Okay.

35:05.350 --> 35:06.690
Take a seaT.

35:06.750 --> 35:08.670
Scott,you're in.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.240
You know where you're supposed to be?

35:10.280 --> 35:12.330
Yes,sir.Know exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

35:12.380 --> 35:14.940
What I want toeaR.Let's run
this pla let's get "win" on 3 --

35:14.980 --> 35:16.900
1,2,3.win

35:21.830 --> 35:23.580
Jamie,look.Daddy's going in!

35:23.630 --> 35:25.350
Yeah!

36:04.530 --> 36:06.200
paul.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.340
Appreciate you meeting me.

36:10.420 --> 36:11.790
You got two minuteS.

36:11.850 --> 36:14.560
Tell me why you should
direct this moviE.

36:15.100 --> 36:19.200
My movies have made a lot of money
for a lot of studios,including yours.

36:19.750 --> 36:22.300
But I look at my rum?

36:22.490 --> 36:24.550
and there's something missing.

36:24.720 --> 36:29.800
I've yet to make that one quality
movie,the one I'm proud of.

36:29.980 --> 36:32.350
I think this can be that movieand...

36:38.560 --> 36:43.380
because I identify with this world.

36:44.600 --> 36:49.210
I understand the feeling lucas gets every
time he steps on the river court at night.

36:49.410 --> 36:52.370
I can show the audience how a song
can instantly change peyton's mood.

36:52.420 --> 36:56.310
I recognize that there are two completely
different sides to brooke davis,

36:56.370 --> 36:58.530
both of which are amazing.

36:59.520 --> 37:03.240
I want to make the little
things the big things,paul.

37:05.450 --> 37:07.420
I'm the guy to do it.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.770
I hope you don't mind me coming.

37:24.790 --> 37:27.040
I kind of had a feeling about tonighT.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.460
Well,I didn't exactly
light up the box score.

37:30.510 --> 37:32.690
Zero points,zero rebounds...

37:32.780 --> 37:34.330
one assist.

37:34.330 --> 37:36.250
Best stat of the night.

37:41.470 --> 37:43.640
You know,I knew you'd make it.

37:44.160 --> 37:46.670
And I know I don't
get to be part of it...

37:47.950 --> 37:50.520
but I am so proud of you,soN.

38:45.730 --> 38:47.630
Can I talk to you?

38:47.730 --> 38:49.130
Yeah.

38:49.490 --> 38:51.470
Sure.Is everything okay?

38:52.880 --> 38:54.410
Come here.

38:54.770 --> 38:56.630
What's up?

39:00.680 --> 39:03.470
I can't accept this ring.

39:04.170 --> 39:05.800
I mean,it's beautiful,and I love it.

39:05.890 --> 39:09.160
I just -- it's not the
ring that I want to weaR.

39:09.570 --> 39:13.950
I always dreamed I'd be wearing keith's
ring,and I know how much it means to you,

39:14.030 --> 39:17.630
so that's the ring I want to
wear for the rest of my life.

39:19.620 --> 39:21.760
You sure?

39:46.250 --> 39:48.420
now it's right where it belongs.

39:49.370 --> 39:51.760
And it will be forever.

40:06.860 --> 40:08.820
I want you to have this.

40:10.510 --> 40:12.840
And what is this supposed to mean?

40:12.920 --> 40:15.010
It means we're going steady.

40:15.760 --> 40:18.000
This isn't a game,julian.

40:18.190 --> 40:20.150
I know.

40:21.670 --> 40:27.680
When I first got here,everyone thought
I came for a girl --the girl in the book.

40:28.020 --> 40:30.950
But I only came here to make a moviE.

40:31.580 --> 40:35.210
But now it turns out everyone was right.

40:35.410 --> 40:40.250
I am here for the girl in
the book --the other girl.

40:57.560 --> 41:01.510
maybe we should continue
this in my bedroom...

41:01.620 --> 41:04.980
preferably without our clotheS.

41:14.590 --> 41:16.660
You son of a bitch!

41:16.780 --> 41:18.580
What do you want,reese?

41:18.900 --> 41:21.960
I just wanted to come by and
give you the good news myself.

41:23.030 --> 41:25.190
I'm directing the moviE.

41:26.820 --> 41:27.950
Done!

41:28.040 --> 41:29.240
I signed on tonight!

41:29.290 --> 41:31.590
You and I are gonna have some fun.

41:33.080 --> 41:36.060
Oh,I've got a couple thoughts
about that last scene.

41:36.100 --> 41:37.840
Don't worry about
it.We'll talk tomorroW...

41:38.130 --> 41:39.210
partneR.
