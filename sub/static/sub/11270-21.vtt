WEBVTT

00:08.200 --> 00:10.654
Sam, let me have the TV control.

00:12.701 --> 00:16.696
- What are you gonna watch?
- Something extraordinary on TV.

00:16.828 --> 00:20.739
- What's up. Game on?
- What is it, the Bruins?

00:26.622 --> 00:29.491
l think the lady
singing the anthem is loaded.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.786
Diane, what the hell is this?

00:33.916 --> 00:37.283
Wagner's ''Ring of the Nibelungs'',
the complete cycle.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.906
''Das Rheingold'', ''Die Walküre'',

00:40.043 --> 00:42.876
''Siegfried''
and finally ''Götterdämmerung''.

00:43.002 --> 00:45.705
l hope they don't use
that canned laughter.

00:47.462 --> 00:52.914
lt's not comedy. This is opera.
l'll explain as we proceed.

00:53.047 --> 00:57.871
This is the story of a golden ring
with magical powers

00:58.006 --> 01:00.756
that curses anyone who owns it.

01:00.882 --> 01:05.707
Wait. They had that same story
on <i>Scooby Doo</i> Saturday morning.

01:06.384 --> 01:09.299
But the dog sang
a little better than that.

01:09.427 --> 01:13.124
Come on, you guys. Give it a chance.

01:14.261 --> 01:16.502
The first three hours are...

01:20.596 --> 01:23.382
l put up with your sporting events.

01:23.514 --> 01:26.134
lt's time that you return the favour.

01:26.265 --> 01:29.963
After ten minutes, if you aren't
totally mesmerised by its beauty,

01:30.099 --> 01:33.015
- l will turn it off.
- Ten minutes?

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:42.645 --> 01:45.015
Very funny.

01:45.812 --> 01:49.179
Culture's wasted on you.
Oxygen is wasted on you.

01:55.524 --> 01:58.191
That was not a very nice thing
to do to Diane.

01:58.316 --> 02:02.062
- Sam's got a point there.
- She has watched a lot of sports.

02:02.192 --> 02:04.349
Let's give it another shot.

03:30.052 --> 03:32.671
Coach, l'm gonna be in the back
checking the wine.

03:32.802 --> 03:34.379
OK, Sam.

03:38.137 --> 03:42.630
Would you like to join me?
lt's quiet, empty, dimly lit.

03:43.347 --> 03:45.919
Much like your mind.

03:47.598 --> 03:49.222
So, what do you say?

03:49.349 --> 03:52.301
Sam, you talk a lot
about our having a dalliance,

03:52.433 --> 03:55.598
but l've always been told
that barking dogs don't bite.

03:55.726 --> 03:57.966
Biting. ls that what you're into?

03:59.560 --> 04:03.390
Do you know what bothers me? There
are women upon whom this works,

04:03.520 --> 04:06.886
and they're allowed
to vote and drive cars.

04:11.314 --> 04:13.352
So, what do you say?

04:15.315 --> 04:17.353
Fred and Ginger are taking a break,

04:17.482 --> 04:20.564
but they'll be back
to nauseate you later on.

04:23.859 --> 04:27.226
Eddie, it's been nice talking to you.

04:27.360 --> 04:32.233
By the way, did l tell you that
my wife passed away some time ago?

04:32.945 --> 04:33.940
Yeah.

04:35.363 --> 04:40.436
Thanks. l really appreciate that.
ls your wife dead yet, Ed?

04:42.198 --> 04:45.730
That's good. l wanna thank you
for thinking about me,

04:45.866 --> 04:47.691
and l'll get back to you.

04:47.825 --> 04:49.863
So long, pal.

04:50.867 --> 04:52.111
What is it?

04:52.243 --> 04:56.284
Pal of mine, Eddie Fuentes, manages
in the Winter Leagues in Venezuela.

04:56.411 --> 05:00.571
He says if l can learn Spanish,
he might have a job for me, coaching.

05:00.703 --> 05:02.860
You mean you're gonna
return to coaching?

05:02.996 --> 05:05.781
Yeah,
baseball's so much simpler than life.

05:05.913 --> 05:08.450
ln baseball
l always know where l'm at.

05:08.581 --> 05:12.528
We're up, l'm in the coach's box.
They're up, l'm in the dugout.

05:12.665 --> 05:17.158
The game is over, l hit the head,
get a cheeseburger.

05:18.167 --> 05:20.621
- Sounds like a great life.
- lt's terrific.

05:20.751 --> 05:22.956
You know any Spanish, Coach?

05:23.085 --> 05:27.329
l took some courses for a couple
of days just to learn a few phrases.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.540
Like what?

05:28.670 --> 05:34.502
Like, ''How tall is my dentist?''
and ''ls that really your sister?''

05:34.630 --> 05:36.668
Just enough to get by.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.583
- You're gonna do fine, Coach.
- Thanks, Cliff.

05:47.259 --> 05:49.795
lnteresting.

05:49.926 --> 05:54.087
That was Sam's brother.
He's on his way over.

05:54.219 --> 05:57.171
- Brother? Didn't know he had one.
- Me either.

05:57.304 --> 05:59.793
- He didn't tell any of you?
- Coach?

06:00.263 --> 06:01.590
<i>Si?</i>

06:03.847 --> 06:07.676
- Did you know Sam has a brother?
- Of course l know he had a brother.

06:07.807 --> 06:09.928
- He hates him.
- Why does he hate him?

06:10.057 --> 06:15.214
He was cruel to him. When Sam was a
kid, he'd shove his head underwater.

06:15.351 --> 06:18.800
Wait a minute. That was my brother.

06:20.352 --> 06:22.427
Come to think of it,
that was my head.

06:24.437 --> 06:27.554
Don't Sam and his brother
spend any time together?

06:27.688 --> 06:31.552
They get together whenever he's in
town, but he's never been to Cheers.

06:31.689 --> 06:34.225
He's coming now,
and someone has to tell Sam.

06:35.148 --> 06:37.720
Let me do it. l'm a smoothie
about breaking bad news.

06:44.234 --> 06:47.648
- Your apartment burned down.
- My God. Really?

06:47.777 --> 06:53.064
No. Your brother's on his way over.
Makes you feel better, doesn't it?

06:54.321 --> 06:58.611
- l hate it when you do that.
- lt cushions the blow.

06:59.780 --> 07:02.234
- My brother's in town?
- l took the call.

07:02.365 --> 07:06.988
- He was just leaving his hotel.
- Good. Did you tell him l was here?

07:07.116 --> 07:10.447
Of course. l had no idea
this would be a problem.

07:10.575 --> 07:14.701
No problem. My brother's coming over.
l love my brother.

07:14.827 --> 07:16.901
That's not what l heard.

07:18.536 --> 07:22.661
Step in here and let me show you
something l've triumphed over.

07:24.329 --> 07:27.613
Don't tell me
you've finally mastered the stapler.

07:29.831 --> 07:32.830
Sit down. What they were
talking about out there

07:32.957 --> 07:36.075
is l used to have this problem
with my brother, Derek.

07:36.208 --> 07:39.657
lt was kind of...
an inferiority complex.

07:39.792 --> 07:44.700
But that was a long time ago,
and l conquered it.

07:44.836 --> 07:50.751
Here it is. This is the guy that
used to make me feel like nothing.

07:52.463 --> 07:54.501
What?

07:55.505 --> 08:00.496
He's very nice-looking. He'd be even
better if he had his two front teeth.

08:00.632 --> 08:03.382
l blacked those out myself.

08:03.508 --> 08:05.795
That was before
l got over my problem.

08:05.925 --> 08:10.548
l didn't go to any psychiatrists.
l didn't read any fancy books.

08:10.677 --> 08:15.668
l just sat myself down and said,
''My brother's no better than l am.''

08:16.762 --> 08:18.338
l'm sure you're right.

08:19.346 --> 08:23.423
- What's he do for a living?
- He's an international lawyer.

08:26.056 --> 08:29.423
lt so happens l come from
a very intelligent family.

08:31.266 --> 08:35.178
l guess Derek does OK for himself.

08:35.308 --> 08:38.924
He must make 50, 50 grand a year.

08:39.559 --> 08:42.345
You're kidding.
Those guys make 1 0 times that much.

08:44.895 --> 08:49.435
lt's the job. Last year he travelled
so much, he had to buy his own plane.

08:49.563 --> 08:51.934
What kind of life is that?

08:53.314 --> 08:55.352
The poor wretch.

08:56.815 --> 09:00.597
Who am l kidding? The guy
is better at everything than l am.

09:00.733 --> 09:01.930
He's perfect.

09:02.317 --> 09:06.182
Sam. He's maybe a man
of some accomplishment,

09:06.318 --> 09:11.024
but this all sounds like a younger
brother idealising his older sibling.

09:11.153 --> 09:13.310
- You think so?
- Sure.

09:13.445 --> 09:15.567
He's just an ordinary Joe.

09:15.696 --> 09:18.066
Can l keep this?

09:20.072 --> 09:22.857
You must have a sense of humour
about these things.

09:22.990 --> 09:27.565
Maybe you're right. lf l looked
at it right, it could be funny.

09:27.699 --> 09:31.113
- Sure.
- One less tooth and a moustache.

09:31.242 --> 09:34.905
Sam, nuclear bomb just hit Boston.

09:35.035 --> 09:37.073
Derek's here.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.612
They're catching on.

09:40.161 --> 09:44.737
Listen. Wait.
l don't want you to worry about me.

09:44.871 --> 09:48.320
l'm used to living around
Mr Wonderful all my life.

09:48.456 --> 09:54.371
lt's no big deal. lt's just that when
he's in the room, l feel invisible.

09:54.499 --> 09:58.245
Sam, l don't pay you
a lot of compliments,

09:58.375 --> 10:03.199
but l really don't feel you have
any need to feel inferior to anyone.

10:03.793 --> 10:06.994
Thank you. That's very nice.

10:11.421 --> 10:13.744
- Nice voice. Who is that?
- Guess.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.508
Way to go, Derek.

10:41.388 --> 10:43.675
- Can we get this man a beer?
- l'll get it.

10:43.805 --> 10:45.843
Sam, sorry, l didn't see you.

10:58.435 --> 11:01.350
Derek, how about a beer?

11:01.477 --> 11:04.145
No, thank you, Norm.

11:06.687 --> 11:09.639
What a guy.
Can l catch a beer, Sammy?

11:10.897 --> 11:14.761
- Where are my waitresses?
- Watching the show.

11:14.898 --> 11:18.478
- The show?
- Derek's doing trick pool shots.

11:19.524 --> 11:22.192
Must have had fun
growing up with him.

11:23.067 --> 11:27.607
Do you have any idea what kind
of gift l could get for Derek?

11:28.444 --> 11:31.561
- Gift?
- l feel l should get him something.

11:31.695 --> 11:34.065
He did get me a job.

11:34.195 --> 11:37.562
He got you a job, after all
those months you're been looking?

11:37.696 --> 11:41.145
Not just a job.
He got me a great job.

11:41.281 --> 11:44.315
For the first time
l'm gonna have my own parking space.

11:44.448 --> 11:48.823
Got a secretary, a window
for water bombs, all the perks.

11:50.283 --> 11:54.361
- Good for you, Norm. That's great.
- So what can l get him?

11:54.493 --> 11:57.776
l really don't care what you get him.
Get him a tie.

11:57.911 --> 12:01.360
Sure. l wouldn't dare
buy clothes for that guy.

12:01.495 --> 12:04.743
He has his lint made in England.

12:04.871 --> 12:08.818
Norm, hurry up. He's gonna do
some tap-dancing for us.

12:12.540 --> 12:16.452
You two, come on back here.
We got a rich guy tap-dancing.

12:38.006 --> 12:39.997
Sammy.

12:40.131 --> 12:42.965
Your brother is one good-looking guy.

12:44.049 --> 12:47.333
Did you ever hear Derek say
anything about being a sucker for

12:47.467 --> 12:50.964
swarthy, fertile,
Mediterranean types?

12:51.843 --> 12:54.379
- Afraid not, Carla.
- Figured.

12:54.511 --> 12:57.759
Let me have a couple of Heinekens
and a couple of Löwenbräus.

12:57.887 --> 13:04.679
How come your brother has beautiful
curly blond hair and deep blue eyes?

13:04.805 --> 13:07.888
- Are they blue?
- Like Windex.

13:12.433 --> 13:17.222
Boy, sounds like the stick lady's
having a good time, doesn't it?

13:18.268 --> 13:23.140
ls that Diane's laugh? l thought they
were killing chickens back there.

13:23.269 --> 13:26.553
He really got to her when he told
her about that time in Paris

13:26.687 --> 13:28.808
when he got drunk with Anais Nin.

13:31.438 --> 13:33.476
Really?

13:34.731 --> 13:36.769
l was hoping you'd know.

13:39.149 --> 13:42.729
Derek's always been like that,
always had to have the spotlight,

13:42.858 --> 13:44.897
had to be the centre of attention.

13:45.026 --> 13:48.855
lf it's any consolation to you,
l know how you feel.

13:48.985 --> 13:51.818
l got a sister
who's got me beat in every way.

13:53.153 --> 13:55.477
She's five foot two,

13:56.446 --> 14:00.772
her husband never has a drink
until noon, and she's a beautician.

14:02.072 --> 14:04.740
How do you compete with that?

14:06.532 --> 14:11.653
But after a while l said to myself,
''To hell with her. l'm me.''

14:11.784 --> 14:14.818
What you're trying to say is
l'm as good as my brother?

14:14.951 --> 14:17.903
You're kidding?
You're not even as good as my sister.

14:20.161 --> 14:22.615
But l still like you best, Sam.

14:22.745 --> 14:25.235
That makes two of us.

14:26.330 --> 14:28.368
Wait a minute.

14:28.955 --> 14:33.282
What do you think?
You think Diane likes Derek?

14:33.874 --> 14:39.077
''Does Diane like Derek?'' l don't
know. l'll pass her a note in gym.

14:40.125 --> 14:43.907
l know what my brother's like
around women, and l know Diane.

14:44.043 --> 14:46.912
You know something?
l used to admire you.

14:47.044 --> 14:49.794
But know what's happened to you
since she got here?

14:49.920 --> 14:53.084
You've turned into a big weenie.

14:53.213 --> 14:56.330
You're a dink, a wimp,
a fred, a loser.

14:56.464 --> 14:57.873
Thank you.

14:58.006 --> 15:01.419
l was having a confidence problem,
but that's been a real boost.

15:02.049 --> 15:06.588
Just a few weeks ago, you were making
time with every foxy lady in Boston,

15:06.717 --> 15:09.206
on your way to legendary status.

15:09.342 --> 15:13.040
You were heading
for the Hounds Hall of Fame.

15:13.177 --> 15:16.425
Then Lady Fishface
walked in the door.

15:16.553 --> 15:21.544
- What's going on here?
- l don't know. lt's driving me nuts.

15:21.679 --> 15:23.718
Maybe she's playing hard-to-get,

15:23.847 --> 15:28.091
but hard-to-get for me used to mean
l'd have to sit through dinner.

15:36.309 --> 15:39.675
lf you can't get to her, no one can.

15:40.227 --> 15:42.265
- What about Derek?
- ln a minute.

15:44.269 --> 15:47.387
But don't worry.
He's got better taste than that.

15:53.856 --> 15:56.724
- What?
- Your brother's teaching me Spanish.

15:57.440 --> 16:00.392
You're learning the Spanish language
in one evening?

16:16.362 --> 16:18.768
You want me to take the bar over?

16:18.905 --> 16:22.236
l get it. You'd rather be here
when he's back there, right?

16:22.364 --> 16:25.647
- Something like that.
- You don't have to draw me pictures.

16:25.782 --> 16:28.615
Although l like it,
but you don't have to.

16:46.330 --> 16:50.371
- What's your order?
- Sam, he's not that great.

16:51.373 --> 16:55.617
He can tell an interesting story,
he's met a few interesting people,

16:55.749 --> 17:00.075
but he's just a man like any other
man you'd meet in Greek mythology.

17:03.210 --> 17:06.125
- What's your order?
- l don't have an order.

17:06.252 --> 17:09.535
l thought you'd like to join
the party. l'll take the bar.

17:09.670 --> 17:11.790
Go back there and enjoy yourself.

17:11.920 --> 17:17.622
Believe it or not, l'm having a lot
of fun just being out here by myself.

17:17.756 --> 17:21.371
l swear, it does not bother me
that my brother's here.

17:22.007 --> 17:23.878
- Really?
- Really.

17:24.924 --> 17:28.457
Good. l feel better
telling you about something.

17:31.343 --> 17:33.381
Derek wants a beer.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.632
l'm buying. l'm taking care of this.

17:35.761 --> 17:37.337
l'm buying.

17:42.346 --> 17:44.384
Sam, l love this bar of yours.

17:44.513 --> 17:47.761
But you know the best thing about it?
lts owner.

17:52.766 --> 17:56.263
- Thanks, Sam.
- Derek, one more game of pool.

18:02.686 --> 18:05.139
You were about to tell me something.

18:07.187 --> 18:11.727
Derek just wants to fly me out
to Martha's Vineyard tonight.

18:14.522 --> 18:16.763
ln a plane or on his back?

18:17.607 --> 18:20.096
He didn't say, specifically.

18:21.108 --> 18:24.723
Of course, he was all excited about
the new Learjet he just bought.

18:24.859 --> 18:28.854
- But it's not a date or anything.
- What if it is? lt's OK with me.

18:31.277 --> 18:35.059
- l thought maybe you'd be bothered.
- Bothered?

18:35.195 --> 18:38.562
l have a date myself tonight.
lt's a good night for it.

18:40.530 --> 18:42.356
OK. lf you're sure.

18:42.489 --> 18:45.903
l think you and Derek
will make a great match.

18:47.532 --> 18:48.527
Really?

18:48.658 --> 18:52.355
You both think you're perfect,
and one of you is right.

18:56.993 --> 19:00.609
You know what your problem is?
You are afraid of your feelings.

19:00.744 --> 19:04.076
l am not. l don't have
any feelings about this.

19:04.204 --> 19:07.487
Whatever you and my brother
Derek want to do is OK with me.

19:07.621 --> 19:08.996
l don't care.

19:11.456 --> 19:13.910
- Fine.
- Please don't go.

19:14.832 --> 19:19.953
What? What did you say?

19:20.084 --> 19:22.869
l said l have no feelings about this.

19:23.543 --> 19:28.415
No, after that. You said something.
lt sounded like ''Please don't go.''

19:28.544 --> 19:30.785
Please don't go? Are you crazy?

19:30.920 --> 19:34.002
You gotta get over
this egotism of yours.

19:34.129 --> 19:37.792
Go, with my blessings.
Have a good time, really.

19:41.256 --> 19:43.295
Please stay here.

19:46.966 --> 19:49.207
Wait a minute.

19:49.342 --> 19:53.124
What was that? There at the end
you said something.

19:53.260 --> 19:58.464
You're hallucinating. Get outta here
and have a good time. Go on.

20:00.429 --> 20:02.634
OK, l'm glad you understand.

20:03.805 --> 20:06.259
- lf you go, l'll die.
- What?

20:07.973 --> 20:11.137
- l heard you say something.
- You're coming unglued.

20:11.265 --> 20:13.340
Please go. Have fun.

20:15.350 --> 20:18.017
- OK, l'll go.
- There you go.

20:18.142 --> 20:21.141
lf you'll excuse me,
l'm going to go freshen up.

20:21.268 --> 20:25.844
- l'd rather stay with you.
- What? What did you say?

20:27.770 --> 20:29.429
l didn't hear anything.

20:35.689 --> 20:39.103
What do you say we go to the
Combat Zone and see a girlie show?

20:39.232 --> 20:41.270
l've got a date, Coach.

20:43.108 --> 20:44.981
Maybe l'll go alone.

20:45.651 --> 20:49.231
lt's a tough neighbourhood.
l think you need some protection.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.193
You're right, Sam.
What do you say, Carla?

20:54.153 --> 20:58.148
- Not tonight, Coach.
- Maybe some other time. Good night.

20:59.821 --> 21:02.275
- See you tomorrow, Sam.
- Yeah.

21:03.281 --> 21:06.398
Want me to hang around
till your date gets here?

21:06.532 --> 21:09.696
- You probably wanna get on home.
- Are you kidding? lt's 2am.

21:09.824 --> 21:11.650
My kids might be there.

21:14.242 --> 21:17.574
Sammy, would you just
tell me one thing?

21:18.285 --> 21:19.826
What do you see in her?

21:21.036 --> 21:23.074
Who?

21:23.203 --> 21:26.535
The one who was off
on a Learjet with your brother.

21:26.663 --> 21:29.152
The one who can't stop talking.
The geek.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.870
l know she's not perfect.
l know she talks too much.

21:33.998 --> 21:36.452
She's all those things you said.

21:37.416 --> 21:40.948
But there are times
when l'm with her she just...

21:41.084 --> 21:43.538
irritates the hell out of me.

21:44.626 --> 21:47.542
- That's what you're looking for?
- Maybe it is.

21:47.669 --> 21:51.249
l know what you mean.
l'm always falling for guys l hate.

21:51.378 --> 21:55.208
My whole life has been the wrong man
at the wrong time in the wrong place

21:55.338 --> 21:57.792
with the wrong birth-control device.

22:08.508 --> 22:10.796
Sam?

22:11.801 --> 22:17.882
You ever thought, even for a minute,
about you and me?

22:18.011 --> 22:20.465
Sure l have, Carla.

22:20.595 --> 22:22.634
A recent minute?

22:23.846 --> 22:27.130
l was always afraid
you'd be too much woman for me.

22:30.307 --> 22:32.760
You're a wise man, Sam Malone.

22:45.770 --> 22:48.804
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, Debbie.

22:48.937 --> 22:51.224
Boy am l glad
you could make it tonight.

22:51.355 --> 22:55.978
lt really isn't very fair to call me
at the last minute like that.

22:56.106 --> 22:59.105
lt's a good thing
my boyfriend's a heavy sleeper.

23:02.441 --> 23:06.139
l just didn't feel like
being alone tonight.

23:08.068 --> 23:11.933
- What do you want to do?
- Something with just the two of us.

23:12.069 --> 23:16.064
l don't wanna think about anything
or anybody but us all night long.
