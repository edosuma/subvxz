00:00.968 --> 00:01.601
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

00:02.367 --> 00:04.267
Where to?
Your place.

00:04.334 --> 00:05.901
Clay, Quinn is Haley's sister.

00:05.968 --> 00:07.434
She has a lot going on right now.

00:07.501 --> 00:09.767
Stay away from her.

00:09.834 --> 00:13.033
You were a huge hit last night.
They think you're amazing.

00:13.100 --> 00:16.367
You don't think I look like
"a frumpy whore on bingo night?"

00:16.434 --> 00:17.701
No!

00:17.767 --> 00:19.467
If I did, would I ask you
to model full time?

00:19.534 --> 00:21.934
Honey, I'm home. Let's do this.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.467
I told you it was realistic.

00:23.534 --> 00:25.100
Hey, honey.

00:25.167 --> 00:26.634
Alex and I worked everything out.

00:26.701 --> 00:27.734
Isn't that great?

00:27.801 --> 00:29.200
"Nathan Scott:

00:29.267 --> 00:31.100
a basketball star's love child."

00:31.167 --> 00:33.100
Like father, like son, huh?

00:33.167 --> 00:34.367
She's just so certain.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.133
You don't remember
meeting her at all or...?

00:36.200 --> 00:38.200
You're actually starting
to believe her, aren't you?

00:38.267 --> 00:40.601
I heard about your problem.
I was wondering if I could...

00:40.667 --> 00:42.067
You could what, help?

00:42.133 --> 00:43.934
You save your help for people
who don't know you

00:44.000 --> 00:45.367
and stay away from me and my family.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.234
You've reached Renee.
Leave a message.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.567
I trust you had a nice flight.

00:51.634 --> 00:54.234
I have a proposition for you.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:04.000 --> 01:06.401
Okay, folks. That's a wrap!

01:06.467 --> 01:07.800
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:07.867 --> 01:10.967
Um, we, uh... we haven't
even shot anything yet.

01:11.034 --> 01:12.501
You might want to call your agent, son.

01:12.568 --> 01:14.401
You're serious?

01:14.467 --> 01:15.934
Hey! Whoa.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
What a pity. I just
found my motivation.

01:29.034 --> 01:30.201
Hey.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.301
Mm.

01:36.367 --> 01:39.267
This hot body of yours
has just inspired me

01:39.334 --> 01:42.301
to do something that
I've never done before.

01:42.367 --> 01:44.167
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

01:44.234 --> 01:47.100
And it's gonna take a lot of hard work,

01:47.167 --> 01:51.100
and it's gonna take a long,
long time.

01:52.601 --> 01:55.601
And I'm gonna need you to start
by taking your pants off.

01:57.234 --> 02:00.967
Oh, that sounds amazing.

02:01.034 --> 02:03.367
But Alex is coming over to work.

02:03.434 --> 02:05.634
Ugh!

02:05.700 --> 02:07.934
You two were up half the night.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.100
It's all business, Brooke.

02:11.833 --> 02:14.234
I don't know. She seems to
have really come around.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.334
I don't buy it.

02:16.401 --> 02:19.000
Once a ho bag, always a ho bag.

02:19.067 --> 02:21.767
Now, as I recall, you...

02:21.833 --> 02:25.167
you might want to consider
what you are about to say

02:25.234 --> 02:26.767
very carefully.

02:30.434 --> 02:33.334
Now come kiss me till ho bag shows up.

02:45.234 --> 02:46.700
Hey.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.334
Hey.

02:48.401 --> 02:49.601
You're up early.

02:49.668 --> 02:50.800
My shot at peace and quiet...

02:50.867 --> 02:52.401
the west coast wakes up in three hours,

02:52.467 --> 02:54.034
and my phone starts ringing.
Nice.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.833
Did you come down for a swim?

02:55.900 --> 02:58.301
Yeah, I tried but, uh, couldn't.

02:58.367 --> 03:01.234
I've been afraid of the ocean
since I was a little girl.

03:01.301 --> 03:03.367
Mm. Sharks.

03:03.434 --> 03:04.568
Immensity.

03:06.067 --> 03:09.067
You know, I thought
if I just threw myself in and...

03:09.134 --> 03:11.100
Well... it didn't quite work out.

03:11.167 --> 03:14.367
You should start smaller,
like a toe.

03:14.434 --> 03:16.668
Work up to an ankle, maybe
even a shin. Who knows?

03:16.733 --> 03:19.401
Yeah, I'm more of a "yank
the band-aid" kind of girl.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.700
Wait.

03:22.967 --> 03:24.601
Go. It's fine.

03:24.668 --> 03:27.833
Hey, man.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.668
Oh, just relax, all right?
I...

03:31.501 --> 03:33.100
Okay, I'll get into it.

03:33.167 --> 03:35.401
Yeah, fine.
I'll meet you at your place.

03:35.467 --> 03:37.134
Oh...

03:37.201 --> 03:38.700
Time to find a phone booth

03:38.767 --> 03:40.800
and change into that
super-agent costume.

03:40.867 --> 03:42.833
Yeah, if only it were that easy.

03:42.900 --> 03:44.401
Um, I hate to run, but...

03:44.467 --> 03:45.534
Go. Save the day.

03:45.601 --> 03:47.767
Okay. See ya.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.167
Oh, no.

04:06.833 --> 04:08.534
Oh... no.

04:08.601 --> 04:11.900
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

04:14.767 --> 04:16.534
I never called Marvin!

04:16.601 --> 04:18.500
Keep it down, Giselle.
I'm trtrying to write.

04:18.567 --> 04:20.301
Besides, I thought you were mad at him.

04:20.367 --> 04:23.501
I was "ignore him for
a couple of hours" mad,

04:23.568 --> 04:26.201
not "disappear for the second
night in a row" mad.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.900
Well, you can thank me later,
but you were way drunk,

04:28.967 --> 04:30.634
so I texted him from your phone

04:30.700 --> 04:32.000
and let him know you were safe.

04:35.767 --> 04:38.668
"Melvin...

04:38.733 --> 04:40.301
got my drink on with Alex.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.234
If you're done being a tool,

04:42.301 --> 04:46.301
you should come rock
out with your co..."

04:46.367 --> 04:47.401
Oh, my God.

04:47.467 --> 04:49.601
Nope, just little old me.

04:49.668 --> 04:52.201
But I do work in mysterious ways.

04:55.334 --> 04:56.967
So you want me to go on your show

04:57.034 --> 04:58.434
and tell the world my story?

04:58.501 --> 04:59.934
That's right.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.833
And you're gonna be on my side?

05:01.900 --> 05:03.301
Why would you do that?

05:03.367 --> 05:06.401
Nathan's your son.
It could ruin him.

05:08.634 --> 05:10.601
But you're the one telling the truth.

05:10.668 --> 05:12.534
You're not telling the truth.

05:12.601 --> 05:14.100
About what?

05:14.167 --> 05:15.501
Renee.

05:15.568 --> 05:18.733
You said you didn't know her
and you didn't remember her.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.134
I don't.

05:20.201 --> 05:21.900
Haley, we've been through this.

05:21.967 --> 05:23.900
Why can't you just believe me?

05:23.967 --> 05:27.100
Her number is all over
your old cellphone bill.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.134
Nathan!

05:35.201 --> 05:36.534
Excuse me...

05:36.601 --> 05:38.534
why aren't you explaining yourself?

05:38.601 --> 05:40.367
Because I shouldn't have to.

05:40.434 --> 05:41.833
But if you insist...

05:41.900 --> 05:43.668
I'm a professional basketball player.

05:43.733 --> 05:45.601
Girls get ahold of my e-mail,
my telephone number.

05:45.668 --> 05:47.134
They try to contact me.

05:47.201 --> 05:50.134
And when they do, I reply
to them and tell them to stop

05:50.201 --> 05:53.534
because I'm happily married to
a woman who loves and trusts me.

05:54.900 --> 05:58.301
So I guess I did lie, Haley...

05:58.367 --> 06:01.034
but only when I told them
that my wife trusts me.

06:19.034 --> 06:20.467
Marvin.

06:20.533 --> 06:22.001
Don't you mean "Melvin"?

06:22.067 --> 06:24.368
Please don't be mad even though
you have every right to be.

06:24.433 --> 06:26.101
Alex called me after she left Julian's,

06:26.167 --> 06:27.834
and I was kind of already drinking

06:27.901 --> 06:30.433
because I thought you didn't think
I was pretty enough to be a model.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.934
When did I say you
weren't pretty enough?

06:32.001 --> 06:33.134
Of course you're pretty enough.

06:33.201 --> 06:34.800
Then maybe we could skip the whole fight

06:34.867 --> 06:36.767
and you could just be
really excited for me,

06:36.834 --> 06:38.134
because... it's official...

06:38.201 --> 06:40.533
you're looking at the newest
face of Clothes Over Bros!

06:42.034 --> 06:43.234
Oh, well, not this face.

06:43.301 --> 06:45.800
But once it's cleaned up
with a little makeup...

06:45.867 --> 06:47.934
Congratulations, Millie.

06:48.001 --> 06:50.301
I just wish I was the one
you wanted to celebrate with.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.567
Anyway, you'll understand if I
can't stay and rock out with my...

06:52.634 --> 06:54.634
Marvin!

06:54.700 --> 06:56.001
That was Alex.

06:56.067 --> 06:57.533
Of course it was.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.767
Well, at least she texted me.

06:59.834 --> 07:01.734
I got to go.

07:07.201 --> 07:08.967
This situation's like a war, Nate.

07:09.034 --> 07:10.533
We're gonna lose a few battles.

07:10.600 --> 07:11.967
Just stop with the metaphors

07:12.034 --> 07:14.067
and tell me what the hell
happened this morning.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.433
Simile.

07:19.301 --> 07:21.567
What? Dimiles use "like"
or "as"... "like a war."

07:21.634 --> 07:22.834
Guys.

07:25.067 --> 07:26.901
We lost the rainstorm
body spray campaign,

07:26.967 --> 07:28.967
And it looks like the
shoe deal's going away.

07:29.034 --> 07:31.567
What?
Temporarily.

07:31.634 --> 07:32.834
This is unbelievable.

07:32.901 --> 07:34.667
I know it feels like the sky is falling,

07:34.734 --> 07:36.334
but when something like this goes down,

07:36.400 --> 07:37.934
marketing executives distance themselves

07:38.001 --> 07:38.934
to protect their brands.

07:39.001 --> 07:40.201
All right, almost always,

07:40.268 --> 07:41.734
they come back as soon
as the air clears.

07:41.800 --> 07:42.934
"Almost always"?

07:43.001 --> 07:44.867
Look, we knew there was a risk

07:44.934 --> 07:46.934
when we decided not to deal with Renee,

07:47.001 --> 07:49.467
but it has become a bit
of an issue with the Bobcats.

07:49.533 --> 07:50.734
They don't want me back?

07:50.800 --> 07:52.467
No, you are far too talented for that,

07:52.533 --> 07:54.134
but they're using it to their advantage,

07:54.201 --> 07:55.467
and negotiations have slowed.

07:55.533 --> 07:57.334
Again, like I said,
we expected this.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.368
More importantly, Nate,

07:59.433 --> 08:01.167
the whole agency's on this,
all right?

08:01.234 --> 08:03.234
Everybody respects your
decision to fight this,

08:03.301 --> 08:04.767
and we've got your back.

08:04.834 --> 08:07.001
You just got to have some faith in us...

08:07.067 --> 08:09.001
and in each other.

08:16.101 --> 08:18.234
Clay.

08:18.301 --> 08:20.567
He's gonna have a career
when this is over, right?

08:20.634 --> 08:23.034
Haley, I'm not gonna let
anything happen to him.

08:23.101 --> 08:25.067
Because you didn't see
how dark he got the first time.

08:25.134 --> 08:26.734
Look, this is a staring contest.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.834
Our best chance at
having her blink first

08:28.901 --> 08:30.533
is if the press gets tired of this

08:30.600 --> 08:33.333
and nobody makes this story
any bigger than it already is.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.500
I'm gonna make this story huge.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.967
But you don't trust me.

08:41.034 --> 08:43.866
I'd have to hate my son
to tell your story, right?

08:43.933 --> 08:47.134
You're smart. I like that.

08:47.201 --> 08:50.134
That means my grandchild will be smart.

08:50.201 --> 08:54.634
Well, I was in Nathan's situation once.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.533
I refused to recognize
a child that I'd fathered,

08:57.600 --> 09:00.334
and it was the second-worst
mistake I ever made,

09:00.400 --> 09:03.934
but I made it in part
because nobody forced me

09:04.001 --> 09:06.334
to look at the
consequences of my actions.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.334
By coming out in support of you

09:09.400 --> 09:11.734
and allowing you to tell your story,

09:11.800 --> 09:14.301
I'll be forcing Nathan
to take responsibility...

09:14.368 --> 09:17.600
if not emotionally,
then at least financially.

09:19.967 --> 09:22.268
He'll never forgive you.

09:22.334 --> 09:23.901
Hmm.

09:23.967 --> 09:26.101
I've made my peace with that.

09:33.334 --> 09:35.301
There she is.

09:35.368 --> 09:37.134
I know... I'm late again, and
we still haven't finished...

09:37.201 --> 09:38.800
The inventory.

09:38.867 --> 09:41.533
I also found that shipment that
went missing in New Mexico,

09:41.634 --> 09:43.368
balanced the register from yesterday,

09:43.433 --> 09:46.201
and took the liberty of ordering
some Bellissimo fabrics from Milan.

09:46.268 --> 09:47.500
You're gonna love them.

09:47.567 --> 09:48.901
I can't wait.

09:51.134 --> 09:53.234
Isn't she amazing?

09:53.301 --> 09:55.834
Um, I guess, but that's my job.

09:55.901 --> 09:57.634
Not anymore, miss thing.

09:57.700 --> 10:00.867
The fashion blogs are
still buzzing about you.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.934
You are officially a model.

10:03.001 --> 10:06.901
Your only job now is to
worry about being pretty.

10:06.967 --> 10:10.201
You... you might want to
worry just a smidge more.

10:10.268 --> 10:13.034
I know.
I was out late.

10:13.101 --> 10:15.634
And, Brooke,
I am excellent at multitasking,

10:15.700 --> 10:18.667
and I'd be happy to keep my
administrative responsibilities.

10:18.734 --> 10:20.334
Nonsense.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.667
I am not gonna have the new face
of my company doing dirty work.

10:23.734 --> 10:24.834
Now off you go.

10:24.901 --> 10:27.167
Do whatever models do
in their spare time.

10:27.234 --> 10:30.201
Just be back this afternoon
for a swimsuit fitting.

10:30.268 --> 10:32.800
Swimsuits?
Mm.

10:32.867 --> 10:34.001
Wow.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.034
Okay.

10:35.101 --> 10:36.201
I mean... great!

10:36.268 --> 10:37.567
Oh...

10:37.634 --> 10:38.967
Welcome to Clothes Over Bros.

10:44.067 --> 10:45.800
Hey, man, how you doing?

10:45.867 --> 10:48.268
I'm doing better than Nathan Scott.

10:48.334 --> 10:50.301
I mean,
that dude can't catch a break.

10:50.368 --> 10:52.301
What do you mean?

10:52.368 --> 10:54.067
You haven't checked the board.

10:54.134 --> 10:57.700
Oh, God, Mouth...

10:57.767 --> 10:59.334
He's losing his endorsements.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.600
Sports is breaking the
story tonight at 6:00.

11:04.001 --> 11:06.234
If Charlie asks for me,
tell him I'm...

11:06.301 --> 11:07.533
I'll be back later.

11:22.834 --> 11:23.901
Clay!

11:23.967 --> 11:26.101
Hey.
Hey.

11:26.167 --> 11:28.667
What, did you run into some kryptonite?

11:33.034 --> 11:34.467
You need a friend?

11:34.533 --> 11:36.634
You have no idea.

11:36.700 --> 11:37.901
Come on.

11:50.334 --> 11:52.301
Seriously, you've been reading forever.

11:52.368 --> 11:54.368
Look, some of it's supposed to be funny.

11:54.433 --> 11:56.734
You're not laughing.
You're not even smiling.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.400
Maybe I'm laughing on the inside.

11:58.467 --> 11:59.400
Are you?

11:59.467 --> 12:00.567
You're not.

12:00.634 --> 12:02.001
You're like,

12:02.067 --> 12:04.201
"wow, does she suck,"
on the inside.

12:04.268 --> 12:05.600
You're like, "she..."

12:10.867 --> 12:13.001
This is good.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.301
Like "I hate it,

12:14.368 --> 12:16.400
But there's a story in
there somewhere" good?

12:16.467 --> 12:18.901
No.
These scenes are genuinely good...

12:18.967 --> 12:21.700
sweet, subtle, funny.

12:21.767 --> 12:23.067
Where did this come from?

12:23.134 --> 12:25.500
Well, I woke up,

12:25.567 --> 12:27.301
and I was watching millicent sleep.

12:27.368 --> 12:29.101
And she was, like,
totally busted.

12:29.167 --> 12:31.134
So I asked myself what it would be like

12:31.201 --> 12:33.634
if I was that tragic, with,
like, no self-confidence.

12:33.700 --> 12:35.734
And then I just added a boy.

12:37.867 --> 12:39.067
Who are you?

12:41.234 --> 12:42.734
Stick around.
Maybe you'll find out.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.334
Unfortunately, I can't stick around,

12:44.400 --> 12:45.500
because you are three hours late,

12:45.567 --> 12:46.901
and I have to meet Brooke for lunch.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.934
Oh! Come on.
Tell her we're on a roll.

12:49.001 --> 12:50.368
Um, no.

12:50.467 --> 12:52.834
She's already a little jealous
of our working relationship,

12:52.901 --> 12:54.368
but maybe we can meet back up tonight.

12:54.433 --> 12:56.201
It's a date.
No.

12:56.268 --> 12:58.034
Date-ish?
Work.

12:58.101 --> 13:00.368
Work... date.

13:09.901 --> 13:12.934
We can still pay her.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.634
For what?
The story's already out there.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.700
For a retraction.

13:17.767 --> 13:19.867
The money she wants
is a drop in the bucket

13:19.934 --> 13:21.934
compared to the rest of your career.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.533
It's too late for that.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.834
Nathan, you're being stubborn,

13:25.901 --> 13:27.167
and I know I was against it at first,

13:27.234 --> 13:28.567
but if she were to get out there

13:28.634 --> 13:29.901
and say that this whole
thing has been a lie...

13:29.967 --> 13:31.700
We're not paying her, Haley!

13:31.767 --> 13:36.134
We're not giving this woman
a dime of our money.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.533
You're really worried about this.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.700
There's just so much riding on it.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.867
Quinn, I'm not in Tree
Hill for a vacation.

13:59.667 --> 14:03.800
A while back,
I went off the rails a bit...

14:03.867 --> 14:06.400
emotionally, and...

14:06.467 --> 14:08.734
luckily I had earned enough
capital with the agency

14:08.800 --> 14:10.034
that they didn't fire me.

14:10.101 --> 14:11.934
They just scaled back my client roster

14:12.001 --> 14:14.567
and suggested I spend the summer here...

14:14.634 --> 14:16.634
pull myself together.

14:18.667 --> 14:22.234
And then Nathan's scandal happened.

14:22.301 --> 14:24.500
So the calm, cool exterior...

14:24.600 --> 14:26.400
is kind of a lie.

14:29.101 --> 14:30.800
Just when I was beginning to wonder

14:30.867 --> 14:32.134
if we had anything in common.

14:38.767 --> 14:41.067
Quinn, I shouldn't be here.

14:41.134 --> 14:42.834
Nathan doesn't want us hanging out,

14:42.901 --> 14:44.433
and I, uh,
I have to respect that.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.268
No, look, Clay...

14:46.334 --> 14:47.934
I'm sorry.

14:48.001 --> 14:50.834
Uh, thank you for this.

14:50.901 --> 14:52.967
I mean that.

14:53.034 --> 14:55.734
You're really great.

15:17.634 --> 15:18.767
Chase...

15:18.834 --> 15:20.201
What brings you in?

15:20.268 --> 15:23.067
Hey. Uh, just doing
a little shopping for Mia.

15:23.134 --> 15:24.334
Ohh.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.001
You guys have been together a long time.

15:26.067 --> 15:27.934
Mm-hmm.
What about you?

15:28.001 --> 15:31.034
I heard Julian moved here.
That must be... awesome.

15:31.101 --> 15:32.400
Uh-huh.

15:32.467 --> 15:34.767
Or not so awesome?

15:34.834 --> 15:36.500
No. It's amazing.

15:36.567 --> 15:38.034
I'm just a little annoyed

15:38.101 --> 15:40.500
because at first I
had him all to myself,

15:40.567 --> 15:43.467
and lately he has been working
with one of my models.

15:43.533 --> 15:45.867
Mm. Well, I wouldn't worry.

15:45.934 --> 15:47.634
I'm sure it's harmless.

15:47.700 --> 15:50.834
I mean, guys, you know,
don't even really...

15:50.901 --> 15:53.400
like... models.

15:57.234 --> 15:59.134
What are you doing today?

15:59.201 --> 16:00.433
That depends

16:00.500 --> 16:02.567
on why you're looking at
me like a piece of steak.

16:04.101 --> 16:06.467
I would have offered to spot you,

16:06.533 --> 16:08.433
but I max out at like 180... ish.

16:09.934 --> 16:12.767
You know, I don't believe
in killing the messenger, Mouth,

16:12.834 --> 16:16.834
but every time I've seen you
lately, it's been bad news.

16:16.901 --> 16:18.867
They're running a story at 6:00

16:18.934 --> 16:21.467
that says you're losing
your endorsements.

16:21.533 --> 16:22.634
Is it true?

16:22.700 --> 16:24.467
Yeah.

16:24.533 --> 16:26.667
I'm sorry, Nate.

16:26.734 --> 16:28.767
Yeah, me too.

16:28.834 --> 16:30.268
I heard about your demotion.

16:30.334 --> 16:33.067
How long are they gonna keep you
locked up in the basement?

16:33.134 --> 16:34.167
The truth?

16:34.234 --> 16:36.101
Till I do a story on you.

16:36.167 --> 16:37.800
Then do the story, Mouth.

16:37.867 --> 16:39.301
Nate...
I'm serious, Mouth.

16:39.368 --> 16:42.201
You've already done
far more than I could ever ask.

16:42.268 --> 16:43.700
Take care of your career.

16:47.967 --> 16:50.201
And then he finally looks up,
and he's like,

16:50.268 --> 16:51.400
"after reading this,

16:51.467 --> 16:53.734
I think we should be in a relationship."

16:53.800 --> 16:56.201
He said that... "relationship"?

16:56.268 --> 16:58.101
Well, I mean,
he put "working" in front of it,

16:58.167 --> 16:59.734
but a relationship is a relationship.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.533
Except in a working relationship,

17:01.600 --> 17:03.368
you never,
under any circumstances,

17:03.433 --> 17:06.233
no matter how tempted you are,
have sex with the other person.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.433
You're aware of that,
right?

17:08.500 --> 17:10.101
I think that's sort of a gray area.

17:10.166 --> 17:12.134
It's actually black-and-white,

17:12.201 --> 17:14.166
crystal-clear, written in stone.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.433
Fine, crabby. Whatever!

17:16.500 --> 17:17.733
Sorry.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.268
It's just Brooke's my friend,

17:19.334 --> 17:21.367
even if she did give my job to Calliope.

17:21.433 --> 17:23.599
Tell me you are not
regretting your decision.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.268
This modeling stuff is awesome.

17:25.334 --> 17:30.067
I mean, it's hard work,
but it's "pretty people" work.

17:30.134 --> 17:32.234
I don't know.
I was good at my job.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.500
Administrative work
is for fatties, Millicent,

17:34.567 --> 17:36.500
and you are not a fatty.

17:36.567 --> 17:37.967
You...

17:38.034 --> 17:40.001
are a plus-size model.

17:52.901 --> 17:55.734
I take it you looked
at Nathan's phone bill.

17:55.800 --> 17:59.201
If I pay you, what do I get?

17:59.268 --> 18:01.234
I go away.

18:01.301 --> 18:03.400
No, I'm sorry.
That's not good enough.

18:03.467 --> 18:04.634
I want a retraction.

18:04.700 --> 18:06.067
I want a public letter

18:06.134 --> 18:08.533
that says this whole
thing has been a lie.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.533
Fine, if that's what
will help you sleep at night,

18:11.600 --> 18:13.167
but it won't be the truth.

18:13.234 --> 18:14.700
And the price has gone up...

18:14.767 --> 18:16.301
$250,000.

18:16.368 --> 18:17.867
That's crazy.

18:17.934 --> 18:19.834
Actually, that's the estimated price

18:19.901 --> 18:22.368
of raising your husband's
child until the age of 18.

18:22.433 --> 18:24.067
Do we have a deal?

18:25.634 --> 18:27.034
I'll tell you what.

18:27.101 --> 18:29.533
You can have until
8:00 tonight to decide.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.433
After that,
I have other options.

18:44.134 --> 18:47.500
Brooke!

18:47.567 --> 18:49.034
Hello!

18:58.368 --> 19:00.101
One sec.

19:00.167 --> 19:01.700
Got it.

19:02.967 --> 19:05.600
Can I borrow you?
Mmm.

19:09.368 --> 19:11.400
Want to tell me why you were
mounting your ex-boyfriend

19:11.467 --> 19:12.700
in the back room?

19:12.767 --> 19:14.134
Because you weren't available.

19:14.201 --> 19:15.600
Very funny.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.400
I'm serious.

19:17.467 --> 19:21.934
This morning I looked over
at this big, sexy body,

19:22.001 --> 19:23.467
and I thought to myself,

19:23.533 --> 19:26.533
"why aren't you making
men's clothes, Brooke Davis?"

19:26.600 --> 19:29.167
Mm-hmm. Clothes for Bros?

19:29.234 --> 19:30.368
Ka-ching!

19:30.433 --> 19:32.334
But in order to make men's clothes,

19:32.400 --> 19:34.368
you need a fit model for measurements.

19:34.433 --> 19:37.967
You were my first choice, but, alas...

19:38.034 --> 19:39.600
I was busy with Alex. I get it.

19:39.667 --> 19:41.001
Well, I'm here now,

19:41.067 --> 19:43.067
and I'm all about taking
my clothes off for you

19:43.134 --> 19:44.334
in the back room,

19:44.400 --> 19:46.334
so you can send your
little boy toy packing.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.800
You're very sweet,

19:47.867 --> 19:49.667
but I think I'm gonna stick with Chase.

19:49.734 --> 19:52.533
I'm already halfway through
his measurements.

19:52.600 --> 19:56.667
But don't worry, baby.
We're all business.

19:58.067 --> 19:59.567
Hey, Chase, break's over!

19:59.634 --> 20:01.967
Drop your pants.

20:06.201 --> 20:08.600
I want back on the air.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.800
I obviously have an opinion,

20:10.867 --> 20:12.867
but at the end of the day,
I work for you.

20:12.934 --> 20:15.600
You are aware of what's
on the board for tonight?

20:15.667 --> 20:17.600
Yeah, Nathan Scott's
losing his endorsements.

20:17.667 --> 20:19.600
I took the liberty of
getting a quote from him.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.667
Nice work.

20:29.734 --> 20:33.101
Glad to hear you've come around.

20:41.034 --> 20:42.167
Don't. It's the press.

20:42.234 --> 20:43.600
They've been calling all day.

20:46.334 --> 20:48.234
Beat it, nerds.

20:49.634 --> 20:51.667
Thanks.

20:51.734 --> 20:53.268
You're welcome.

20:53.334 --> 20:55.034
And as a favor,
it would be great

20:55.101 --> 20:57.101
if you wouldn't give
Clay such a hard time

20:57.167 --> 20:58.467
about hanging out with me.

20:58.533 --> 21:00.368
I'm not a child anymore, Nathan.

21:00.433 --> 21:02.101
Are you sure about that?

21:02.167 --> 21:04.967
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know.

21:05.034 --> 21:08.634
Running away from your problems
just doesn't seem very adult.

21:08.700 --> 21:12.368
Says the guy who's afraid
to answer the telephone.

21:14.134 --> 21:17.201
Look... if you want to sleep around,

21:17.268 --> 21:19.001
I'm sure there's plenty
of guys in Tree Hill

21:19.067 --> 21:20.600
who aren't responsible for my career

21:20.667 --> 21:22.334
that could probably
help you out with that.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.301
You ever hear the one about
people who live in glass houses?

21:25.368 --> 21:26.467
Yeah, I have.

21:26.533 --> 21:28.433
And if you don't like living in mine,

21:28.500 --> 21:31.001
you'll welcome to move back
in with your husband.

21:31.067 --> 21:32.800
Nice, Nathan.

21:32.867 --> 21:35.400
You know, speaking of running
away from your problems,

21:35.467 --> 21:37.800
maybe you should try answering
one of those, coward.

21:48.934 --> 21:52.334
I know you love to say
zero is not a size,

21:52.400 --> 21:56.800
but technically zero is my size,
and those are granny panties.

21:58.134 --> 22:00.201
These are a zero.

22:00.268 --> 22:01.734
Really?

22:01.800 --> 22:03.834
My diet pills must be working.

22:03.901 --> 22:04.800
Your vitamins?

22:04.867 --> 22:05.967
What?

22:06.034 --> 22:07.234
Oh, right.

22:07.301 --> 22:08.334
Vitamins.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.600
Okay.

22:11.667 --> 22:12.834
Whatever.

22:12.901 --> 22:15.834
I'll... see if I can take these in.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.001
Great.

22:17.067 --> 22:18.634
Oh, and speaking of my perfect ass,

22:18.700 --> 22:20.268
I understand from Julian

22:20.334 --> 22:23.567
you might be a little concerned
about our relationship.

22:23.634 --> 22:26.201
Working relationship.

22:26.268 --> 22:29.433
You have nothing to worry about...

22:29.500 --> 22:31.201
Seriously.

22:31.268 --> 22:32.433
I mean, I stripped naked,

22:32.500 --> 22:34.301
and that boy didn't even flinch.

22:34.368 --> 22:35.934
He is clearly so in love with you.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.533
Well, you're not Chase.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.901
If only.

22:56.967 --> 22:59.500
I asked the waitress
if there was a tall, dark,

22:59.567 --> 23:01.301
and handsome boy waiting for his date.

23:01.368 --> 23:02.834
She pointed me here.

23:02.901 --> 23:06.034
Sorry to disappoint, but your
"tall, dark, and handsome"

23:06.101 --> 23:08.767
is getting naked with
my "short, hot, and bossy."

23:08.834 --> 23:09.967
Huh?

23:10.034 --> 23:12.134
He's doing some fit modeling for Brooke

23:12.201 --> 23:13.901
at Clothes Over Bros.

23:13.967 --> 23:15.767
It's harmless.

23:15.834 --> 23:17.067
I hope.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.001
Hey, can I ask you something?

23:21.067 --> 23:23.600
Lose the shirt.
I'll go get a tape measure.

23:23.667 --> 23:26.634
No, actually,
it's about being a songwriter.

23:26.700 --> 23:28.867
Do you ever meet people on tour

23:28.934 --> 23:31.268
that surprise you with their talent?

23:31.334 --> 23:32.800
I mean, uh...

23:32.867 --> 23:36.167
You know, somebody
who seems simple or goofy

23:36.234 --> 23:38.734
Or even ditzy,
and then... bam...

23:38.800 --> 23:41.001
All of a sudden,
they write this amazing song?

23:41.067 --> 23:43.301
Hi. I'm Mia.

23:44.667 --> 23:46.467
No, you're not like that at all.

23:46.533 --> 23:50.533
Maybe not,
but I used to be really shy.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.400
And I think sometimes all somebody needs

23:53.467 --> 23:56.001
is someone to look a little deeper...

23:56.067 --> 23:58.700
unlock their potential,
like Haley did with me.

23:59.834 --> 24:01.167
Hmm.

24:01.234 --> 24:04.167
Was that answer worth lunch?
'Cause I'm kind of starving.

24:06.134 --> 24:07.500
On me.

24:10.433 --> 24:13.301
Baby, you are a genius.

24:13.368 --> 24:17.567
The interest in the interview
with Renee is off the charts.

24:17.634 --> 24:20.134
You're not having second thoughts,
are you?

24:22.034 --> 24:24.101
Dan, Nathan had a chance

24:24.167 --> 24:25.500
to take responsibility for this child,

24:25.567 --> 24:27.134
and he chose not to.

24:27.201 --> 24:30.700
Giving this girl a voice
is the right thing to do.

24:30.767 --> 24:32.901
Well, we don't have a show
unless Renee agrees,

24:32.967 --> 24:35.201
and I haven't heard from
her since this morning.

24:35.268 --> 24:37.134
Mm.

24:41.834 --> 24:43.634
You just leave that up to me.

24:58.767 --> 25:02.234
It doesn't matter where I go,
you always seem to find me.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.500
I just follow all the other girls.

25:04.567 --> 25:06.734
They lead me right to you.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.834
It hasn't been easy lately.

25:09.901 --> 25:12.467
Then I guess it's a good thing I'm here.

25:15.167 --> 25:18.567
How'd you like to stay
the night tonight?

25:18.634 --> 25:19.967
Like old times.

25:20.034 --> 25:21.368
Well...

25:21.433 --> 25:24.301
that's up to you, isn't it?

25:45.034 --> 25:46.934
I called Renee.

25:48.667 --> 25:49.901
What?

25:49.967 --> 25:54.967
She said for $250,000,
she would sign a retraction.

25:56.167 --> 25:58.567
Amazing...

25:58.634 --> 26:00.167
The economy's crumbling,

26:00.234 --> 26:02.734
and the truth keeps
getting more expensive.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.334
Well, she's willing to say
this whole thing was a lie,

26:05.400 --> 26:07.034
so...

26:07.101 --> 26:09.634
You willing to believe it?

26:09.700 --> 26:12.067
I didn't come out here to ask
for your permission, Nathan.

26:12.134 --> 26:15.067
I came here to tell you
that I'm paying her.

26:33.600 --> 26:34.867
Are you okay?

26:34.934 --> 26:36.634
No, I'm not okay!

26:36.701 --> 26:39.967
Ho bag got naked in front of Julian!

26:40.034 --> 26:41.600
"Ho bag"?

26:41.667 --> 26:45.300
Alex "my butt is the
size of a kumquat" Dupre.

26:45.367 --> 26:46.867
She is so manipulative

26:46.934 --> 26:49.168
and materialistic and self-serving

26:49.233 --> 26:51.034
and naked and...
Brooke-ish?

26:52.467 --> 26:54.168
What did you say?
Nothing.

26:54.233 --> 26:58.901
Funny, I could have sworn
that I heard you speak.

26:58.967 --> 27:00.134
I meant she just seems

27:00.200 --> 27:01.734
a little bit like you
were in high school.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.667
Huh.

27:06.734 --> 27:08.967
He always wanted high-school Brooke.

27:10.401 --> 27:12.267
Can I put my pants back on now?

27:13.967 --> 27:15.834
I'll take that as a yes.

27:33.601 --> 27:36.200
You blame yourself
for Nathan's troubles.

27:36.267 --> 27:38.967
I wasn't a great influence...

27:39.033 --> 27:41.134
the girls, the parties.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.601
Do you think he did it?

27:43.667 --> 27:45.067
No.

27:45.134 --> 27:49.467
Then stop blaming yourself and fix it.

27:57.267 --> 28:00.401
Stay the night.

28:00.467 --> 28:03.167
I miss this.

28:03.234 --> 28:04.933
Is that what you want?

28:09.100 --> 28:11.300
That's what I need.

28:21.601 --> 28:24.000
Nathan Scott is Tree Hill local

28:24.067 --> 28:25.834
who overcame injury and adversity

28:25.900 --> 28:28.167
to achieve a dream he
had since childhood...

28:28.234 --> 28:30.334
a dream to play professional basketball.

28:30.401 --> 28:32.933
But lately Nathan's career
has taken a backseat

28:33.000 --> 28:34.834
to allegations of an affair

28:34.900 --> 28:37.300
that led to the pregnancy of a fan.

28:40.634 --> 28:43.000
In my opinion, continuing
to report on these allegations

28:43.067 --> 28:45.100
without any further
evidence of their validity

28:45.167 --> 28:48.100
is a reckless attempt
on the part of this network

28:48.167 --> 28:49.567
to boost ratings.

28:49.634 --> 28:53.467
Now, I'm not saying
athletes are above the law.

28:53.534 --> 28:55.701
I'm saying it's up to science

28:55.768 --> 28:57.834
to determine the
validity of these claims,

28:57.933 --> 28:59.134
not the evening news.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.768
To date,
there has been no new evidence

29:01.834 --> 29:06.501
to suggest that Nathan Scott
is guilty of these allegations,

29:06.567 --> 29:09.267
and yet he looks guiltier
the more that we report on him.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.167
Sorry.

29:19.234 --> 29:21.200
I think I left my
camera in your bathroom.

29:21.267 --> 29:23.000
For my part,
I got into sports news

29:23.067 --> 29:24.868
because I think reporting on athletes

29:24.933 --> 29:28.300
inspires people to be exceptional.

29:28.367 --> 29:31.401
And while I've never been
an exceptional athlete,

29:31.467 --> 29:35.167
I can strive to be exceptional
in my own way...

29:35.234 --> 29:37.601
by refusing to bow to pressure,

29:37.667 --> 29:40.334
by refusing to stoop to a
level that's beneath me,

29:40.401 --> 29:44.100
just like Nathan Scott has refused to.

29:44.167 --> 29:45.601
Found it!

29:57.401 --> 29:59.034
I believe in Nathan Scott.

30:04.534 --> 30:06.100
But I also believe in my viewers.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.501
I believe you don't want any part

30:13.567 --> 30:16.734
in dragging him through the mud.

30:18.100 --> 30:20.933
So if you want Sports
news and not gossip,

30:21.000 --> 30:22.467
turn the channel.

30:22.534 --> 30:26.100
Let my boss know that news
isn't just about ratings.

30:26.167 --> 30:29.301
It's about people and integrity,

30:29.367 --> 30:32.134
but mostly it's about truth,

30:32.200 --> 30:34.867
and that still means something.

30:36.601 --> 30:39.900
I am Marvin McFadden,
and this is Sports.

30:39.967 --> 30:43.833
Or at least... it used to be.

30:53.867 --> 30:56.401
Her retraction at this point
won't change anyone's opinion.

30:56.467 --> 30:58.334
It might.

30:58.401 --> 31:00.634
They'll all just assume we paid her off,

31:00.701 --> 31:02.301
and we will have,

31:02.367 --> 31:05.933
which will just make us
look even more guilty.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.701
But you know this, Haley, which...

31:08.768 --> 31:11.701
makes me think the only reason
you have left to pay her off

31:11.768 --> 31:12.601
is that you're starting to believe

31:12.668 --> 31:14.334
she might be telling the truth.

31:15.401 --> 31:19.967
Haley, if I'm guilty of this...

31:20.034 --> 31:23.334
not only am I the kind of guy
that would cheat on you,

31:23.401 --> 31:26.034
I'm the kind of guy
that would father a child

31:26.100 --> 31:28.234
and then turn his back.

31:28.301 --> 31:30.200
I'm Dan Scott.

31:30.267 --> 31:32.200
If you think I'm capable of that,

31:32.267 --> 31:33.701
you do what you have to do,

31:33.768 --> 31:36.734
but I guarantee you,
if you've lost faith in me,

31:36.800 --> 31:39.867
all the money in the world
isn't gonna fix it.

32:07.168 --> 32:08.201
Yeah?

32:08.268 --> 32:09.934
You all right?

32:11.834 --> 32:13.534
No.

32:13.600 --> 32:14.967
But it's okay.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.967
If I was,
I'd be a pretty lousy person.

32:18.034 --> 32:19.934
I'm sorry about earlier.

32:20.001 --> 32:21.400
It's just been...

32:21.467 --> 32:22.567
I know.

32:24.300 --> 32:28.467
I'm sorry that woman's lying about you.

32:28.534 --> 32:32.567
I know you'd never hurt Haley like that.

32:32.634 --> 32:35.201
And you're not a coward.

32:35.268 --> 32:38.600
If anyone's a coward, it's me.

32:38.667 --> 32:42.967
I'm not running away
from my problems, Nathan.

32:43.034 --> 32:46.001
I'm walking away from
something that's broken.

32:46.067 --> 32:49.234
And that doesn't mean
that I'm not scared.

32:49.300 --> 32:52.201
I just don't know how to let him go.

32:52.268 --> 32:55.634
I guess you do it a
little bit at a time.

33:01.367 --> 33:03.367
You're welcome to stay
here under our roof

33:03.433 --> 33:05.201
for as long as it takes, though.

33:06.934 --> 33:08.433
Thank you.

33:26.500 --> 33:28.201
Wow.

33:28.268 --> 33:32.967
A candlelit pool-table-top
picnic dinner.

33:33.034 --> 33:34.767
What's the occasion?

33:34.834 --> 33:37.600
I figured my man was gonna be hungry

33:37.667 --> 33:41.667
after spending the day modeling
for his ex-girlfriend.

33:41.734 --> 33:44.634
She get all your measurements?

33:44.700 --> 33:47.034
All but one.

33:47.101 --> 33:48.967
Oh, yeah? What'd she miss?

33:49.034 --> 33:50.867
How much I love my girlfriend.

33:52.300 --> 33:54.433
She forgot the most important
measurement of all?

33:54.500 --> 33:55.801
She didn't forget.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.467
She just didn't have
a tape measure big enough.

33:58.534 --> 34:01.967
Always with the best answers.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.934
Always with the best lips.

34:20.034 --> 34:22.500
If you ask it who's the fairest
of them all, I'm out.

34:25.667 --> 34:27.766
Whoa, hey. That was a joke.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.367
Millie, I'm not mad anymore, okay?

34:30.433 --> 34:33.268
Last night was my fault.
I shouldn't have been so...

34:33.333 --> 34:35.667
I think I made a mistake, Marvin.

34:35.734 --> 34:37.699
I don't know if I want this.

34:37.766 --> 34:40.001
Then why'd you say yes?

34:40.067 --> 34:43.667
Because it made me feel special.

34:43.734 --> 34:47.801
I mean,
I felt competent at my old job.

34:47.867 --> 34:53.467
I felt smart and capable and reliable,

34:53.534 --> 34:56.067
but I never felt special.

34:56.134 --> 34:58.901
I think...

34:58.967 --> 35:01.300
you're the most special
girl I've ever met.

35:01.367 --> 35:04.567
Thank you, Marvin.

35:04.634 --> 35:07.101
But that night, it was like

35:07.168 --> 35:11.600
the whole world believed I was special.

35:11.667 --> 35:13.333
But who am I kidding?

35:13.400 --> 35:16.101
I'm not a model.
I'm just Millicent.

35:19.101 --> 35:20.134
Come here.

35:30.234 --> 35:33.034
What are you doing?

35:35.567 --> 35:37.834
Funny...

35:37.901 --> 35:39.801
you are definitely the same girl

35:39.867 --> 35:42.600
who rocked the fashion industry'
world the other night,

35:42.667 --> 35:43.834
and she was a model.

35:43.901 --> 35:46.467
Have you been through
any drastic changes

35:46.534 --> 35:48.001
in the last 48 hours?

35:48.067 --> 35:49.201
No.

35:49.268 --> 35:50.667
Hmm.

35:50.734 --> 35:52.901
Then, uh...

35:52.967 --> 35:56.934
unless I'm mistaken,
you're still a model.

35:57.001 --> 35:59.367
And if modeling makes you feel special,

35:59.433 --> 36:00.901
then you should do it,

36:00.967 --> 36:03.168
'cause you deserve to feel that way.

36:03.234 --> 36:07.400
You deserve to feel special
every second of every day.

36:17.767 --> 36:20.101
All right,
I'll explain this in a minute.

36:20.168 --> 36:22.567
Take your time.
I am happy to watch.

36:24.534 --> 36:25.901
You work.

36:25.967 --> 36:27.700
I am happy to watch you work.

36:27.767 --> 36:31.534
It's very interesting and work-ish.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.067
I'm gonna get that.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.300
Brooke.

36:41.367 --> 36:42.734
Come in.

36:42.801 --> 36:44.801
Thanks.
This'll just take a second.

36:44.867 --> 36:46.734
You're fired.

36:46.801 --> 36:48.201
I have a contract.
I'll pay you out.

36:48.268 --> 36:49.534
It's worth the loss.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.300
This is so unnecessary.

36:51.367 --> 36:53.867
Julian and I have a
working relationship.

36:53.934 --> 36:55.834
That means no "doing it."

36:55.901 --> 36:57.201
Maybe.

36:57.268 --> 36:59.333
But it's recently been
brought to my attention

36:59.400 --> 37:02.034
that the way you behave is a lot
like high-school me used to,

37:02.101 --> 37:03.500
and I would be insane

37:03.567 --> 37:06.067
to let high-school me
anywhere near the man I love.

37:06.134 --> 37:07.168
The man I love,

37:07.234 --> 37:08.567
who shouldn't even think

37:08.634 --> 37:10.600
about sleeping anywhere
but the couch tonight.

37:10.667 --> 37:12.801
I'm sorry. What did I do?

37:12.867 --> 37:17.001
What you didn't do is tell me
that ho bag got naked for you.

37:17.067 --> 37:18.134
Oh, that.

37:18.201 --> 37:19.300
Yeah, that.

37:19.367 --> 37:20.700
You... couch.

37:20.767 --> 37:23.367
You... fired.

37:23.433 --> 37:26.034
Ciao, bitches.

37:27.867 --> 37:30.300
You can sleep here if you want.

37:53.834 --> 37:55.500
Thanks for meeting me.

37:55.567 --> 37:56.600
Have a seat.

37:58.967 --> 38:00.268
I know it must be hard to believe

38:00.333 --> 38:02.001
That Dan's gonna put you on the air

38:02.067 --> 38:03.333
and let you speak freely

38:03.400 --> 38:05.867
about how awful his
son has been to you.

38:05.934 --> 38:08.234
You could say that.

38:10.400 --> 38:13.168
There's something I
think you should know.

38:13.234 --> 38:16.467
When Dan heard about you,
he reached out to Nathan,

38:16.534 --> 38:19.634
and Nathan shut him down,
just like he always does.

38:19.700 --> 38:21.101
So?

38:21.168 --> 38:25.967
So Dan isn't doing this to
help Nathan see the light.

38:26.034 --> 38:28.268
He's doing this to bury Nathan.

38:28.333 --> 38:32.067
And the deeper Nathan is buried,

38:32.134 --> 38:36.234
the more money he'll have to
pay you to dig himself out.

38:38.667 --> 38:42.801
So... will you do the show?

38:49.834 --> 38:51.467
Okay.

38:51.534 --> 38:52.767
I'm in.

39:04.901 --> 39:07.600
I didn't do it.

39:07.667 --> 39:10.234
I couldn't.

39:19.734 --> 39:21.600
That's what sets you apart from her.

39:21.667 --> 39:25.500
It's one of a thousand
reasons why I could never,

39:25.567 --> 39:29.467
under any circumstances,
cheat on you.

39:32.500 --> 39:36.168
I don't want to see you
lose your... your dream.

39:36.234 --> 39:37.400
Lose her?

39:39.433 --> 39:41.600
She's right here.

39:43.667 --> 39:45.600
And I'm never letting go of her.
