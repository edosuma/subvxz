WEBVTT

00:04.377 --> 00:07.544
Captain's log, stardate 5843.7.

00:07.714 --> 00:11.047
The Enterprise is in the grip
of a raging epidemic.

00:11.217 --> 00:13.210
Three crewmen have died
and 23 others

00:13.386 --> 00:15.794
have been struck down
by Rigelian fever.

00:15.972 --> 00:18.261
In order to combat the illness,
Dr. McCoy needs

00:18.433 --> 00:20.721
large quantities of ryetalyn,

00:20.893 --> 00:23.729
which is the only known antidote
for the fever.

00:23.896 --> 00:26.897
Our sensors have picked up
sufficient quantities of pure ryetalyn

00:27.066 --> 00:29.818
on a small planet
in the Omega system.

00:29.986 --> 00:33.236
We are beaming down to secure
this urgently needed material.

00:33.406 --> 00:35.114
Report.

00:35.283 --> 00:39.067
Jim, there's a large deposit,
bearing 273, four kilometres away.

00:39.579 --> 00:41.655
I got four hours to process that stuff

00:41.831 --> 00:43.658
otherwise the epidemic
will be irreversible.

00:43.833 --> 00:46.704
- Everybody on board the Enterprise...
- Strange.

00:47.378 --> 00:50.581
Readings indicate a life form
in the vicinity, apparently human.

00:51.382 --> 00:55.000
Yet ship sensors indicated
this planet was uninhabited.

00:56.596 --> 00:58.754
Let's get that ryetalyn.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:23.373 --> 01:24.950
Inoperative.

01:37.887 --> 01:39.796
Do not kill.

01:46.187 --> 01:49.390
- I'm Captain James Kirk...
- I know who you are.

01:49.565 --> 01:52.566
I have monitored your ship
since it entered this system.

01:53.653 --> 01:57.235
Then if you know who we are,
you know why we're here, Mr?

01:57.406 --> 01:59.150
Flint.

01:59.325 --> 02:00.784
You will leave my planet.

02:01.828 --> 02:03.951
Did you say your planet, sir?

02:04.122 --> 02:07.491
My retreat from the unpleasantness
of life on Earth

02:07.667 --> 02:09.375
and the company of people.

02:10.086 --> 02:14.297
Mr. Flint, I have a sick crew
up there.

02:14.465 --> 02:16.292
We can't possibly reach
another planet in time.

02:16.467 --> 02:17.796
You can't refuse us the ryetalyn.

02:18.344 --> 02:19.803
You're trespassing, captain.

02:21.597 --> 02:23.257
We're in need.

02:24.392 --> 02:27.143
We'll pay for it, work for it,
trade for it.

02:27.311 --> 02:31.605
- You have nothing I want.
- But you have the ryetalyn we need.

02:33.025 --> 02:34.769
If necessary, we'll take it.

02:34.944 --> 02:39.523
If you do not leave voluntarily,
I have the power to force you to leave.

02:39.699 --> 02:41.857
Or kill you where you stand.

02:54.672 --> 02:58.006
Space, the final frontier.

03:03.639 --> 03:07.767
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:07.935 --> 03:11.885
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

03:12.064 --> 03:15.813
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

03:15.985 --> 03:19.354
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

04:06.410 --> 04:11.452
Kirk to Enterprise. Mr. Scott,
lock phasers onto our coordinates.

04:11.624 --> 04:14.957
Aye, captain. All phasers locked on.

04:15.878 --> 04:19.293
Mr. Flint, if anything happens to us,

04:19.464 --> 04:21.623
four deaths,

04:21.801 --> 04:24.837
and then my crew comes down
and takes that ryetalyn.

04:28.182 --> 04:30.056
An interesting test of power.

04:30.226 --> 04:33.262
Your enormous forces against mine.
Who would win?

04:34.522 --> 04:38.104
Mr. Flint, unless you are certain,

04:38.275 --> 04:41.810
I would suggest you refrain
from a most useless experiment.

04:42.530 --> 04:44.321
We need only a few hours.

04:44.490 --> 04:46.696
Have you seen a victim
of Rigelian fever?

04:46.867 --> 04:48.326
They die in one day.

04:48.494 --> 04:50.700
The effects are like bubonic plague.

04:53.916 --> 04:57.367
Constantinople, summer, 1334.

04:58.587 --> 05:01.707
It marched through the streets,
the sewers.

05:01.882 --> 05:06.509
It left the city by oxcart, by sea,
to kill half of Europe.

05:07.138 --> 05:12.096
The rats, rustling and squealing
in the night, as they too died.

05:12.852 --> 05:16.221
- The rats.
- Are you a student of history, sir?

05:19.650 --> 05:21.559
I am.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.818
The Enterprise, a plague ship.

05:27.199 --> 05:29.951
You have two hours, at the end
of which time, you will leave.

05:31.871 --> 05:34.326
With all due gratitude.

05:34.498 --> 05:37.701
M-4 will gather the ryetalyn
which you need.

05:43.215 --> 05:46.798
Permit me to offer you
more comfortable surroundings.

06:03.652 --> 06:05.692
Come in, gentlemen.

06:08.407 --> 06:11.906
Our ship sensors did not reveal
your presence here, Mr. Flint.

06:12.077 --> 06:13.737
My planet is surrounded by screens

06:13.913 --> 06:16.071
which create the impression
of lifelessness.

06:16.248 --> 06:20.116
A protection against the curious,
the uninvited.

06:20.294 --> 06:22.121
Then you live here alone.

06:22.296 --> 06:26.210
Except for M-4, which serves
as butler, housekeeper, gardener

06:26.383 --> 06:28.874
and guardian.

06:29.178 --> 06:32.843
A most impressive home, Mr. Flint.

06:33.599 --> 06:38.060
Yes. A Shakespeare first folio,
a Gutenberg bible.

06:38.229 --> 06:41.395
Creation lithographs by Taranullus
of Centauri Vll.

06:41.565 --> 06:43.772
That's one of the rarest
book collections in the galaxy,

06:43.943 --> 06:45.603
spanning centuries.

06:45.903 --> 06:48.061
Be comfortable, gentlemen.

06:50.407 --> 06:52.696
Help yourselves to brandy.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.871
Do we trust him?

06:58.165 --> 07:01.285
It would seem logical to do so
for the moment.

07:01.669 --> 07:04.954
Well, I'll need two hours to process
that ryetalyn into antitoxin.

07:05.130 --> 07:07.253
If that ryetalyn isn't here in one hour,

07:07.424 --> 07:09.962
we'll go prospecting,
right over Mr. Flint, if necessary.

07:11.428 --> 07:15.212
This is the most splendid
private collection of art I've ever seen.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.134
And the most unique.

07:17.309 --> 07:20.096
The majority are the works
of Leonardo da Vinci,

07:20.271 --> 07:22.144
Renaissance period.

07:22.314 --> 07:24.603
Some of the works
of Reginald Pollack, 20th century.

07:24.775 --> 07:26.649
And even a Sten from Marcus II.

07:26.819 --> 07:29.144
At last I've seen other humans.

07:29.321 --> 07:32.441
- Other men.
- One is not human.

07:32.616 --> 07:34.241
The Vulcan.

07:34.702 --> 07:36.575
So that is a Vulcan.

07:36.745 --> 07:39.663
I would like to discuss
subdimensional physics with him.

07:39.832 --> 07:41.456
You've taught me all you know
in the area

07:41.625 --> 07:43.084
and you say Vulcans know more.

07:43.252 --> 07:46.419
Even he is not your intellectual equal,
nor mine.

07:46.589 --> 07:50.372
- Let me meet them.
- They are selfish, brutal.

07:50.551 --> 07:52.543
A part of the human community
which I rejected

07:52.720 --> 07:55.045
and from which I've shielded you.

07:55.222 --> 07:58.176
Soon they will be gone.
Let me meet them.

08:02.896 --> 08:04.521
Rayna,

08:14.283 --> 08:15.563
have you been lonely?

08:17.661 --> 08:19.072
What is loneliness?

08:20.581 --> 08:22.870
It is a thirst.

08:25.377 --> 08:27.334
It is a flower dying in the desert.

08:33.052 --> 08:37.049
Flint, don't take this opportunity
away from me.

08:37.222 --> 08:39.381
It's so exciting.

08:41.602 --> 08:43.429
Exciting?

08:44.396 --> 08:47.397
You have never made
a demand of me before.

08:49.735 --> 08:51.562
I'm sorry.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.529
Don't be sorry.

08:57.785 --> 08:59.861
It might be interesting.

09:06.251 --> 09:09.834
- Saurian brandy, 100 years old. Jim?
- Please.

09:12.591 --> 09:14.916
Mr. Spock, I know
you won't have one.

09:15.094 --> 09:18.545
Heaven forbid those mathematically
perfect brainwaves be corrupted

09:18.722 --> 09:20.964
by this all-too-human vice.

09:21.141 --> 09:23.632
Thank you, doctor.
I will have a brandy.

09:25.687 --> 09:28.013
Do you think the two of us can handle
a drunk Vulcan?

09:28.440 --> 09:30.765
Once alcohol hits that green blood...

09:31.902 --> 09:36.279
If I appear distracted,
it is because of what I've seen.

09:36.448 --> 09:40.612
I am close to experiencing
an unaccustomed emotion.

09:42.162 --> 09:43.573
I'll drink to that.

09:45.999 --> 09:48.075
- What emotion?
- Envy.

09:49.294 --> 09:53.458
None of these da Vinci paintings has
ever been catalogued or reproduced.

09:53.632 --> 09:56.467
They are unknown works,
all apparently authentic,

09:56.635 --> 09:59.636
to the last brushstroke
and use of materials.

09:59.805 --> 10:02.640
As undiscovered da Vincis,
they would be priceless.

10:02.808 --> 10:05.892
Would be?
You mean you think they're fakes?

10:06.770 --> 10:11.646
Most strange. A man of Flint's
obvious wealth and impeccable taste

10:11.817 --> 10:13.893
scarcely needs to hang fakes.

10:14.069 --> 10:19.027
Yet my tricorder analysis indicates
that the canvas and pigments used

10:19.449 --> 10:21.941
are of contemporary origin.

10:24.163 --> 10:28.409
Well, this could be
what it seems to be.

10:28.584 --> 10:31.620
Or it could be a cover,
a setup, or even an illusion.

10:31.795 --> 10:35.378
That could explain the paintings,
similar to the real thing.

10:35.549 --> 10:39.084
Spock, at your earliest opportunity,
take a full tricorder reading of our host,

10:39.261 --> 10:41.135
see if he's human.

10:41.513 --> 10:43.340
- Kirk to Enterprise. Mr. Scott?
- Aye, captain.

10:43.515 --> 10:48.343
Mr. Scott, run a full computer check
on Mr. Flint

10:48.520 --> 10:51.307
and on this planet, Holberg 917-G.

10:51.481 --> 10:53.059
Stand by with your results.
I'll contact.

10:53.233 --> 10:54.775
- Aye, sir.
- Kirk out.

10:56.069 --> 11:00.862
Well, let's enjoy this brandy.
It tastes real.

11:06.663 --> 11:08.288
Easy.

11:16.924 --> 11:18.382
Bones?

11:20.218 --> 11:22.888
Ryetalyn, ready to be processed
into antitoxin.

11:23.055 --> 11:25.380
Beam up to the ship
and start processing.

11:25.557 --> 11:28.226
That will not be necessary, captain.

11:28.393 --> 11:30.600
M-4 can prepare the ryetalyn
for inoculation

11:30.771 --> 11:33.606
more quickly in my laboratory
than you could aboard your ship.

11:33.774 --> 11:35.647
I would like to supervise that,
of course.

11:36.610 --> 11:38.318
And when you are satisfied
as to procedures,

11:38.487 --> 11:41.060
I hope you will do me the honour
of being my guests at dinner.

11:41.239 --> 11:44.110
Thank you, Mr. Flint.
I don't think we have the time.

11:44.868 --> 11:49.364
I regret my earlier inhospitality.
Let me make amends.

12:10.268 --> 12:14.397
Gentlemen, may I present Rayna.

12:19.194 --> 12:21.767
I thought you lived alone.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.985
I meant there are no others
besides my family.

12:27.285 --> 12:29.112
Dr. McCoy.

12:30.163 --> 12:31.955
Mr. Spock.

12:32.582 --> 12:36.663
Mr. Spock, I do hope we can find
a moment to discuss field density

12:36.837 --> 12:39.209
and its relationship
to gravity phenomena.

12:39.840 --> 12:45.510
Indeed. I would appreciate such a talk.
It is an interest of mine.

12:46.221 --> 12:47.964
Captain Kirk.

12:48.974 --> 12:51.928
- Captain Kirk?
- Rayna.

12:52.310 --> 12:55.644
Her parents were killed in an accident
while in my employ.

12:55.814 --> 12:59.598
Before dying, they placed their infant,
Rayna Kapec, in my custody.

12:59.776 --> 13:04.154
- I have raised and educated her.
- With most impressive results, sir.

13:04.322 --> 13:07.822
What else interests you
besides gravity phenomena, Rayna?

13:07.993 --> 13:11.326
Everything. Less than that
is betrayal of the intellect.

13:11.496 --> 13:14.912
The totality of the universe?
All knowledge?

13:15.292 --> 13:18.791
Rayna possesses the equivalent
of 17 university degrees

13:18.962 --> 13:20.622
in the sciences and arts.

13:20.797 --> 13:23.798
She is aware
that the intellect is not all.

13:23.967 --> 13:28.296
But its cultivation must come first,
or the individual makes errors,

13:28.472 --> 13:31.556
wastes time in unprofitable pursuits.

13:31.725 --> 13:35.675
At her age, I rather enjoyed errors
with no noticeable damage.

13:36.146 --> 13:39.396
But, I must admit, you're the farthest
thing from a bookworm I've ever seen.

13:40.484 --> 13:42.476
Flint is my teacher.

13:42.986 --> 13:44.813
You are the only other men
I've ever seen.

13:44.988 --> 13:49.697
The misfortune of men everywhere
and our privilege.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.369
If you will accompany my robot
to the laboratory, doctor,

13:56.541 --> 14:00.076
you can rest assured that the ryetalyn
is being processed.

14:00.253 --> 14:01.795
Thank you, sir.

14:05.091 --> 14:09.670
Your pleasure, gentlemen?
Chess, billiards, conversation?

14:12.265 --> 14:14.887
Why not all three?

15:00.313 --> 15:02.804
- Did you teach her that?
- We play often.

15:02.983 --> 15:04.358
May I show you, captain?

15:12.117 --> 15:15.283
You said savagery, Mr. Flint. When
was the last time you visited Earth?

15:15.453 --> 15:18.205
You would tell me
that it is no longer cruel.

15:18.373 --> 15:22.122
But it is, captain. Look at your starship,
bristling with weapons.

15:22.544 --> 15:24.667
Its mission: To colonise, exploit,

15:24.838 --> 15:27.839
destroy, if necessary,
to advance Federation causes.

15:30.218 --> 15:31.629
Yes.

15:31.803 --> 15:33.381
Thank you.

15:34.639 --> 15:36.881
Our missions are peaceful,
our weapons defensive.

15:37.058 --> 15:41.138
If we were barbarians,
we would not have asked for ryetalyn.

15:41.313 --> 15:44.682
Indeed, your greeting, not ours,
lacked a certain benevolence.

15:46.151 --> 15:50.445
The result of pressures
which are not

15:51.156 --> 15:52.401
your concern.

15:55.702 --> 15:57.825
Yes, well, most pressures
are everywhere, in everyone,

15:57.996 --> 16:00.748
urging him to what you call savagery.

16:00.915 --> 16:05.661
The private hells, the inner needs
and mysteries, the beast of instinct.

16:09.341 --> 16:12.840
As human beings,
that is the way it is.

16:13.011 --> 16:14.671
To be human is to be complex.

16:14.846 --> 16:19.841
You can't avoid a little ugliness
from within and from without.

16:27.025 --> 16:29.730
Why don't you play the waltz,
Mr. Spock?

16:31.696 --> 16:35.694
To be human is also to seek pleasure,
to laugh, to dance.

16:35.867 --> 16:37.824
Rayna is a most accomplished
dancer.

16:44.209 --> 16:47.827
- May I have the pleasure?
- Thank you.

18:47.665 --> 18:50.666
- Is there something wrong?
- Yes, the ryetalyn is no good.

18:50.835 --> 18:53.955
It contains irillium,
nearly one part per thousand.

18:54.130 --> 18:58.342
Irillium will render the antitoxin inert
and useless.

19:00.178 --> 19:02.883
Most unfortunate
that it was not detected.

19:03.056 --> 19:05.594
I shall go with M-4
to gather more ryetalyn

19:05.767 --> 19:08.305
and screen it myself.

19:08.811 --> 19:12.180
- You're welcome to join me, doctor.
- Thank you.

19:12.357 --> 19:14.100
Time factor, Bones, epidemic.

19:14.275 --> 19:17.312
Nearly two and a half hours. I guess
we got time to get in under the wire.

19:17.487 --> 19:19.526
Never seen anything
like the speed of that robot.

19:19.697 --> 19:21.690
It'd take us twice as long
to process that stuff.

19:21.866 --> 19:23.195
But would we have made the error?

19:23.368 --> 19:27.317
Jim, what if all the ryetalyn
on this planet contains irillium?

19:29.540 --> 19:33.040
Go with Flint.
Keep an eye on procedures.

19:33.211 --> 19:34.456
Like a hawk.

19:34.629 --> 19:38.543
Captain, something else
which is rather extraordinary.

19:39.592 --> 19:43.341
This waltz I just played
is by Johannes Brahms.

19:43.513 --> 19:48.091
- Later, Spock.
- Captain, it is written in manuscript.

19:48.267 --> 19:49.382
In original manuscript

19:49.560 --> 19:52.396
in Brahms' own hand,
which I recognise.

19:52.563 --> 19:57.854
It is totally unknown,
definitely the work of Brahms,

19:58.027 --> 20:00.779
and yet, unknown.

20:00.947 --> 20:03.616
I think I will go to the laboratory.
There may be a way of reversing

20:03.783 --> 20:06.072
the irillium's effect
and saving the existing antitoxin.

20:06.244 --> 20:07.738
Stay here.

20:07.996 --> 20:10.913
Let me know
when Flint and McCoy return.

20:40.653 --> 20:45.944
Captain's log, stardate 5843.75.

20:46.242 --> 20:49.196
Have I committed a grave error
in accepting Flint's word

20:49.370 --> 20:52.157
that he would deliver
the antidote to us?

20:52.331 --> 20:54.905
The precious time I have let pass
may result in disaster

20:55.084 --> 20:58.121
for the Enterprise and her crew.

21:28.701 --> 21:31.655
You left us.
The room became lonely.

21:32.747 --> 21:37.076
It is a thirst.
A flower dying in the desert.

21:37.251 --> 21:39.160
What?

21:50.348 --> 21:54.013
- What's in there?
- I do not know.

21:54.310 --> 21:56.468
Flint told me never to enter.

21:56.646 --> 21:59.647
- He denies me nothing else.
- Then why are you here?

22:02.276 --> 22:04.316
I do not know.

22:05.029 --> 22:07.602
I come here when I am troubled.

22:08.282 --> 22:12.362
When I would search myself.

22:12.870 --> 22:14.827
Are you troubled now?

22:15.456 --> 22:17.081
Yes.

22:17.416 --> 22:18.994
By what?

22:34.642 --> 22:39.055
Are you happy here with Flint?

22:40.147 --> 22:44.311
He is the greatest, kindest,
wisest man in the galaxy.

22:45.111 --> 22:47.187
Then why are you afraid?

23:11.596 --> 23:13.588
Don't be afraid.

24:03.314 --> 24:05.437
Stop command.

24:10.071 --> 24:11.481
Stop.

24:24.710 --> 24:25.825
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

24:27.671 --> 24:29.878
Fortunately, the robot did not detect
my presence

24:30.049 --> 24:32.801
and deactivate my phaser.

24:49.276 --> 24:53.191
M-4 was programmed to defend
this household and its members.

24:53.364 --> 24:55.570
No doubt I should have altered
its instructions to allow

24:55.741 --> 24:59.110
for unauthorized but predictable
actions on your part.

24:59.286 --> 25:02.490
It thought you were attacking Rayna.
A misinterpretation.

25:02.665 --> 25:05.619
If it were around right now,
it would correct...

25:14.677 --> 25:16.385
Too useful a device
to be without, really.

25:16.554 --> 25:18.546
I created another.

25:18.722 --> 25:22.388
It will now go to the laboratory
and join Dr. McCoy.

25:26.230 --> 25:30.062
- Fascinating.
- Be thankful you did not attack me.

25:30.234 --> 25:34.148
I might have accepted battle and
I have twice your physical strength.

25:34.321 --> 25:38.568
In your own words, it would be
"an interesting test of power."

25:39.076 --> 25:41.567
How childish he is, Rayna.

25:41.745 --> 25:45.161
Would you call him brave or a fool?

25:47.293 --> 25:50.792
I'm glad you did not die.

25:50.963 --> 25:52.671
Of course.

25:52.840 --> 25:55.710
Death, when unnecessary,
is a tragic thing.

25:57.511 --> 26:00.085
Dr. McCoy is in the laboratory
with the new ryetalyn.

26:00.264 --> 26:02.422
He's satisfied as to its quality.

26:02.600 --> 26:06.384
May I suggest that you wait here,
patiently, safely?

26:07.271 --> 26:08.765
You have seen
that my defence systems

26:08.939 --> 26:10.315
operate automatically,

26:10.482 --> 26:14.611
and not always in accordance
with my wishes.

26:15.613 --> 26:17.356
Come, Rayna.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.614
Rayna.

26:30.669 --> 26:32.163
Come.

26:36.091 --> 26:38.843
I don't like the way
he orders her around.

26:39.511 --> 26:43.758
Since we are dependent on Mr. Flint
for the ryetalyn, captain,

26:43.933 --> 26:45.427
may I respectfully suggest that

26:45.601 --> 26:47.926
you pay less attention
to the young lady

26:48.103 --> 26:49.895
if you should encounter her again.

26:50.064 --> 26:54.144
Our host's interests do not appear
to be confined to art and science.

26:57.821 --> 27:00.906
He loves her?

27:01.450 --> 27:02.909
Strongly indicated.

27:03.077 --> 27:04.986
Jealousy.

27:08.999 --> 27:10.493
Yes.

27:10.793 --> 27:15.751
That would explain the attack,
but he seemed to want us together.

27:15.923 --> 27:19.623
The billiard game.
He suggested we dance.

27:19.802 --> 27:23.965
It does appear to defy the male logic,
as I understand it.

27:28.602 --> 27:31.224
- Kirk to Enterprise. Mr. Scott.
- Aye, captain.

27:31.397 --> 27:32.974
Report on the Rigelian fever.

27:33.148 --> 27:35.106
Nearly everybody aboard
has got it, captain.

27:35.275 --> 27:37.813
We're working a skeleton crew
and waiting for the ryetalyn.

27:37.987 --> 27:40.359
Just a little while longer, Scotty.

27:40.531 --> 27:43.104
Report on the computer search.

27:43.283 --> 27:47.696
There's no report on Mr. Flint.
He doesn't seem to have any past.

27:49.039 --> 27:52.408
The planet was purchased
30 years ago by a Mr. Brack,

27:52.584 --> 27:54.826
a wealthy financier and recluse.

27:55.004 --> 27:58.503
Run a computer check
on Rayna Kapec.

27:58.674 --> 28:01.509
Status, legal ward after the death
of her parents.

28:01.677 --> 28:04.927
- Aye, sir.
- Kirk out.

28:06.515 --> 28:09.267
We have still
a greater mystery, captain.

28:09.435 --> 28:12.186
I was able to run a tricorder scan
on Mr. Flint.

28:12.354 --> 28:16.482
He is human, but there are certain
biophysical peculiarities.

28:16.650 --> 28:19.568
Some body function readings
are disproportionate.

28:19.987 --> 28:24.031
For one thing,
extreme age is indicated,

28:24.199 --> 28:26.525
on the order of 6000 years.

28:27.244 --> 28:28.904
Can you confirm that, Mr. Spock?

28:29.079 --> 28:32.365
I shall program the readings through
Dr. McCoy's medical computer

28:32.541 --> 28:34.949
- when we return to the ship.
- Time factor?

28:35.127 --> 28:36.751
We must commence
ryetalyn injections

28:36.920 --> 28:38.794
within two hours and 18 minutes

28:38.964 --> 28:42.380
or the epidemic will prove fatal
to us all.

28:44.303 --> 28:46.342
What's keeping the processing
this time?

28:46.513 --> 28:48.387
The delay may be deliberate.

28:48.557 --> 28:51.178
As though he was keeping us here
for some reason.

28:51.351 --> 28:52.727
Most interesting.

28:52.895 --> 28:55.812
Our host appears
to wish us to linger,

28:55.981 --> 28:58.519
yet he is apprehensive.

28:59.651 --> 29:02.569
It is logical to assume
that we are being monitored

29:02.738 --> 29:06.107
and that he is aware
of our every move.

29:11.455 --> 29:14.028
You sent the robot to kill him.

29:14.333 --> 29:16.491
It came to protect you.

29:16.668 --> 29:19.456
My mind could not have summoned it.
I was not frightened.

29:19.630 --> 29:23.081
It was defective, then.
I would have destroyed it myself.

29:24.343 --> 29:26.382
Have I lied to you?

29:27.387 --> 29:28.716
Never.

29:28.889 --> 29:30.632
Believe what I say.

29:30.808 --> 29:33.559
I would not want Captain Kirk dead.

29:34.728 --> 29:36.637
What did you feel?

29:40.484 --> 29:44.564
- You'll let them have the ryetalyn?
- Yes.

29:44.988 --> 29:48.322
Go to them if you wish.
Say your farewells.

29:55.165 --> 29:57.324
- Kirk here.
- Mr. Scott, sir.

29:57.501 --> 30:01.795
There's no record of a Rayna Kapec
in Federation legal banks.

30:02.381 --> 30:03.579
No award of custody?

30:03.757 --> 30:07.969
No background at all
in any computer banks. Like Flint.

30:08.762 --> 30:10.340
Kirk out.

30:11.515 --> 30:13.554
"Like Flint."

30:14.268 --> 30:15.892
People without a past.

30:16.061 --> 30:18.552
What hold does he have over her?

30:18.730 --> 30:23.108
Captain, I would suggest that
our immediate concern is the ryetalyn.

30:28.282 --> 30:29.776
Let's find McCoy.

30:31.368 --> 30:32.648
Captain?

30:38.750 --> 30:40.660
I'll meet you in the lab.

30:45.465 --> 30:46.841
I've come to say goodbye.

30:47.551 --> 30:49.128
I don't want to say goodbye.

31:56.912 --> 32:02.154
A last tender encounter, Captain Kirk,
to end your usefulness.

32:03.710 --> 32:07.079
I tell you, Spock, I was waiting
for the robot to finish the processing

32:07.255 --> 32:10.292
and the next thing I knew,
it was gone and so was the ryetalyn.

32:10.467 --> 32:15.129
Interesting. Obviously Mr. Flint
is not yet ready for us to depart.

32:15.305 --> 32:19.054
- Well, I think we better tell Jim.
- The captain wanted us to wait here.

32:19.226 --> 32:21.099
Come with me.

32:21.478 --> 32:24.728
I offer you happiness.

32:25.315 --> 32:27.936
I've known security here.

32:28.318 --> 32:30.358
Childhood must end.

32:30.654 --> 32:32.777
You love me, not Flint.

32:48.839 --> 32:51.330
Flint lied. The ryetalyn isn't here.

32:51.508 --> 32:53.797
Picking up tricorder readings,
captain.

32:53.969 --> 32:55.878
Apparently the ryetalyn
is behind this door.

33:08.275 --> 33:10.848
Why is Flint playing tricks on us?

33:13.613 --> 33:16.567
Apparently we're supposed to go in
and get it.

33:17.242 --> 33:18.902
If we can.

33:19.661 --> 33:22.745
Let's not disappoint
the chess master.

33:22.914 --> 33:25.037
Phasers on full.

33:29.546 --> 33:33.378
Captain, I shall get the ryetalyn.

33:34.050 --> 33:38.380
- Why you?
- There may be dangers within.

33:39.306 --> 33:41.879
- Let's find out.
- Let me go alone, captain.

33:42.058 --> 33:43.553
Why?

33:44.311 --> 33:47.146
Get to the point, Spock,
if there is one.

33:49.065 --> 33:50.975
We'll all go.

34:13.172 --> 34:15.081
The ryetalyn.

35:14.150 --> 35:17.317
Captain's log, stardate 5843.8.

35:17.487 --> 35:19.563
We have accomplished our mission
and have the ryetalyn

35:19.739 --> 35:22.491
ready to combat the epidemic
aboard the Enterprise.

35:23.034 --> 35:26.569
But we have also discovered
our benefactor's secret.

35:26.746 --> 35:30.281
He has created the perfect woman.

35:31.126 --> 35:32.703
Her only flaw:

35:34.004 --> 35:35.830
She's not human.

35:40.802 --> 35:44.301
Physically human, but not human.

35:44.472 --> 35:47.343
These are earlier versions
of Rayna, Jim.

35:47.517 --> 35:49.177
She's an android.

35:49.352 --> 35:52.104
Created here by my hand.

35:57.026 --> 35:59.352
Here the centuries of loneliness
were to end.

35:59.529 --> 36:02.613
Your collection of Leonardo da Vinci
masterpieces, Mr. Flint.

36:03.491 --> 36:05.614
They appear to have been
recently painted

36:05.785 --> 36:09.700
on contemporary canvas
with contemporary materials.

36:09.873 --> 36:13.705
And on your piano,
a waltz by Johannes Brahms.

36:14.419 --> 36:19.413
An unknown work, in manuscript,
written in modern ink.

36:19.591 --> 36:22.924
Yet absolutely authentic,
as are your paintings.

36:25.930 --> 36:29.134
I am Brahms.

36:33.813 --> 36:36.565
- And da Vinci?
- Yes.

36:37.108 --> 36:39.813
How many other names
shall we call you?

36:41.237 --> 36:45.152
Solomon, Alexander, Lazarus,
Methuselah, Merlin, Abramson.

36:45.325 --> 36:47.282
A hundred other names
you do not know.

36:47.744 --> 36:49.618
- You were born?
- In that region of Earth

36:49.788 --> 36:51.910
later called Mesopotamia,

36:52.081 --> 36:54.999
in the year 3834 B.C.,

36:55.543 --> 36:57.951
as the millennia are reckoned.

36:58.588 --> 37:01.874
I was Akharin.

37:02.050 --> 37:05.834
A soldier, a bully and a fool.

37:06.554 --> 37:09.757
I fell in battle, pierced to the heart,

37:10.391 --> 37:12.514
and did not die.

37:12.685 --> 37:14.429
Instant tissue regeneration

37:14.604 --> 37:18.649
coupled with some perfect form
of biological renewal.

37:19.025 --> 37:22.809
- You learned that you're immortal.
- And to conceal it.

37:23.071 --> 37:25.478
To live some portion of a life.

37:26.449 --> 37:30.317
To pretend to age and then move on
before my nature was suspected.

37:30.495 --> 37:33.615
Your wealth and your intellect

37:33.790 --> 37:36.826
are the product
of centuries of acquisition.

37:37.335 --> 37:40.371
You knew the greatest minds
in history.

37:40.547 --> 37:44.212
Galileo, Socrates, Moses.

37:44.801 --> 37:46.959
I have married a hundred times,
captain.

37:47.136 --> 37:49.425
Selected, loved, cherished,

37:50.515 --> 37:54.014
caressed a smoothness,
inhaled a brief fragrance.

37:55.144 --> 38:00.768
Then age, death, the taste of dust.

38:00.984 --> 38:02.264
Do you understand?

38:04.112 --> 38:07.694
You wanted a perfect,
ultimate woman.

38:07.991 --> 38:12.569
As brilliant, as immortal, as yourself.

38:14.247 --> 38:16.820
Your mate for all time.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.491
Designed by my heart.

38:20.211 --> 38:21.955
I could not love her more.

38:22.130 --> 38:24.418
Spock, you knew?

38:25.425 --> 38:26.967
I had hoped I was wrong.

38:27.135 --> 38:29.293
You cannot love an android, captain.
I love her.

38:29.470 --> 38:33.171
She is my handiwork, my property.
She is what I desire.

38:33.349 --> 38:35.556
You brought me here to learn this?

38:37.186 --> 38:39.512
- Does she know?
- She will never know.

38:41.190 --> 38:42.566
- Let's go.
- You will stay.

38:45.111 --> 38:48.694
- Why?
- We have discovered what he is.

38:48.865 --> 38:51.272
If you leave,
the curious would follow.

38:51.451 --> 38:54.867
The foolish, the meddlers,
the officials, the seekers.

38:55.038 --> 38:58.822
My privacy was my own.
Its invasion be on your head.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.158
We can remain silent.

39:01.336 --> 39:05.203
The disaster of intervention, Spock,
I've known it. I will not risk it.

39:05.798 --> 39:07.506
Kirk to Enterprise.

39:10.678 --> 39:14.213
Clear out of the area.
Inform Starfleet Command...

39:14.557 --> 39:17.344
Enterprise? Scotty?

39:18.102 --> 39:20.676
They cannot answer, captain.

39:42.335 --> 39:43.449
My crew.

39:43.628 --> 39:46.000
The test of power.
You had no chance.

39:50.843 --> 39:52.753
It is time for you to join your crew.

39:52.929 --> 39:56.049
You'd wipe out 400 lives? Why?

39:56.224 --> 40:00.221
I have seen 100 billion fall.
I know death better than any man.

40:00.395 --> 40:03.514
I have tossed enemies
into his grasp.

40:03.898 --> 40:05.606
And I know mercy.

40:06.401 --> 40:09.070
Your crew is not dead,
but suspended.

40:09.237 --> 40:12.653
Worse than dead.
Restore them. Restore my ship.

40:12.824 --> 40:16.193
In time. A thousand, 2000 years.

40:16.369 --> 40:18.196
You will know the future,
Captain Kirk.

40:18.371 --> 40:20.660
You have been such men.

40:20.832 --> 40:23.038
You've known and created
such beauty.

40:23.668 --> 40:26.538
You've watched your race evolve
from cruelty and barbarism

40:26.712 --> 40:29.797
throughout your enormous life
and yet now you would do this to us?

40:29.966 --> 40:33.500
The flowers of my past.
I hold the nettles of the present.

40:33.678 --> 40:37.047
- I am Flint now, with my needs.
- What needs?

40:37.223 --> 40:40.473
Tonight, I've seen
something wondrous,

40:40.643 --> 40:42.636
something I've waited for,
laboured for.

40:42.812 --> 40:44.436
Nothing must endanger it.

40:44.605 --> 40:47.642
At last Rayna's emotions
have stirred to life.

40:47.817 --> 40:51.233
Now they will turn to me
in this solitude which I preserve.

40:51.404 --> 40:52.863
No.

40:54.323 --> 40:55.355
Rayna.

40:55.533 --> 40:59.233
- You must not do this to them.
- I must.

40:59.412 --> 41:01.535
What will you feel for him
after we are gone?

41:09.714 --> 41:12.252
All emotions are in play, Mr. Flint.

41:12.425 --> 41:14.880
You harm us, she hates you.

41:17.805 --> 41:22.266
Give me back my ship.
Your secret is safe with us.

41:42.872 --> 41:46.075
That's why you delayed the processing
of the ryetalyn.

41:50.213 --> 41:54.459
You realised what was happening.
You kept us together, Rayna and me.

41:57.929 --> 42:01.428
Because you knew
I could bring her emotions alive.

42:05.603 --> 42:08.176
And now you're just going
to take over?

42:08.356 --> 42:12.816
I shall take what is mine,
when she comes to me.

42:13.194 --> 42:15.981
We are mated, captain.
Alike, immortal.

42:16.155 --> 42:19.026
We must forget your feelings in this
matter, which is impossible for you.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.908
Impossible.

42:21.118 --> 42:22.743
Impossible.

42:23.621 --> 42:25.530
From the beginning, you used me.

42:33.464 --> 42:35.457
I can't love her.

42:36.759 --> 42:38.799
But I do love her.

42:42.723 --> 42:46.092
- And she loves me.
- No.

42:47.353 --> 42:49.013
Captain, your primitive impulses

42:49.188 --> 42:51.394
- will not alter the circumstances.
- Stay out of this.

42:51.565 --> 42:54.353
- We're fighting over a woman.
- No, you're not, for she is not.

43:10.209 --> 43:13.293
I cannot be the cause of this.

43:15.006 --> 43:18.291
I will not be the cause of this.

43:24.682 --> 43:26.888
Please, stop.

43:29.437 --> 43:31.097
Stop.

43:31.272 --> 43:35.898
I choose where I want to go.

43:36.485 --> 43:38.727
What I want to do.

43:39.989 --> 43:41.364
I choose.

43:47.204 --> 43:50.205
I choose.

43:50.374 --> 43:52.830
- Rayna.
- No.

43:54.086 --> 43:56.708
Do not order me.

43:58.299 --> 44:00.671
No one can order me.

44:01.594 --> 44:03.421
She's human.

44:04.847 --> 44:07.303
Down to the last blood cell,
she's human.

44:07.850 --> 44:13.437
Down to the last thought, hope,
aspiration, emotion, she's human.

44:14.356 --> 44:18.401
The human spirit is free.
You have no power of ownership.

44:19.570 --> 44:21.148
She's free to do as she wishes.

44:21.322 --> 44:25.022
Gentlemen, I urge you to stop.
There is a danger.

44:25.201 --> 44:27.277
No man beats me.

44:28.037 --> 44:29.994
I don't want to beat you.

44:31.040 --> 44:34.160
This is no test of power.

44:34.335 --> 44:36.577
Rayna belongs to herself.

44:36.754 --> 44:40.917
And she claims
the human right of choice,

44:41.217 --> 44:45.464
to be as she wills.

44:45.638 --> 44:48.473
To do as she wills,
to think as she wills.

44:49.475 --> 44:51.633
That's what I have worked for.

44:54.897 --> 44:56.391
Rayna,

44:57.858 --> 44:59.021
come with me.

45:02.279 --> 45:03.524
Stay.

45:11.956 --> 45:19.251
I was not human.

45:21.590 --> 45:27.794
Now I love.

45:31.892 --> 45:34.679
I love.

45:52.329 --> 45:54.785
You can't die.

46:01.213 --> 46:03.502
- What happened?
- She loved you, captain.

46:05.676 --> 46:07.218
And you too, Mr. Flint.

46:07.803 --> 46:11.421
As a mentor, even as a father.

46:11.932 --> 46:15.977
There was not enough time for her
to adjust to the awful power

46:16.145 --> 46:18.351
and contradictions
of her new-found emotions.

46:19.982 --> 46:23.018
She could not bear to hurt
either of you.

46:24.361 --> 46:27.148
The joys of love made her human

46:27.323 --> 46:30.526
and the agonies of love
destroyed her.

46:48.552 --> 46:50.046
Spock.

46:51.347 --> 46:54.383
The epidemic is reduced
and no longer a threat.

46:54.850 --> 46:59.845
The Enterprise is on course 513,
mark 7, as you ordered.

47:02.107 --> 47:07.481
A very old and lonely man.

47:08.906 --> 47:13.117
And a young and lonely man.

47:15.204 --> 47:16.781
We put on a pretty poor show,
didn't we?

47:21.585 --> 47:23.708
If only I could forget.

47:29.843 --> 47:31.302
Jim...

47:34.473 --> 47:36.549
Thank heaven. Sleeping at last.

47:38.852 --> 47:39.884
Your report, doctor.

47:40.312 --> 47:45.057
Oh, those tricorder readings
on Mr. Flint are finally correlated.

47:45.234 --> 47:48.069
He's dying.
You see, Flint, in leaving Earth,

47:48.237 --> 47:49.945
with all of its complex fields

47:50.114 --> 47:53.483
within which he was formed,
sacrificed immortality.

47:53.659 --> 47:56.613
He'll live the remainder
of a normal life span, then die.

47:56.787 --> 47:58.329
On that day, I shall mourn.

48:00.374 --> 48:02.497
- Does he know?
- Yes, I told him myself.

48:02.668 --> 48:06.119
He intends to devote the remainder
of his years and great abilities

48:06.296 --> 48:08.752
to the improvement
of the human condition.

48:09.633 --> 48:11.542
And who knows
what he might come up with?

48:11.718 --> 48:13.261
Indeed.

48:14.430 --> 48:19.257
Well, I guess that's all.
I can tell Jim later or you can.

48:21.395 --> 48:24.515
Considering his opponent's
longevity,

48:24.815 --> 48:27.306
truly an eternal triangle.

48:29.236 --> 48:31.905
You wouldn't understand that,
would you, Spock?

48:32.072 --> 48:35.156
You see, I feel sorrier for you
than I do for him.

48:36.201 --> 48:40.531
Because you'll never know the things
that love can drive a man to.

48:40.998 --> 48:44.117
The ecstasies, the miseries,

48:44.376 --> 48:46.203
the broken rules,

48:46.378 --> 48:48.786
the desperate chances,

48:48.964 --> 48:53.425
the glorious failures
and the glorious victories.

48:54.386 --> 48:55.845
All of these things you'll never know

48:56.430 --> 48:59.965
simply because the word "love"
isn't written into your book.

49:02.477 --> 49:04.304
Good night, Spock.

49:04.646 --> 49:05.844
Good night, doctor.

49:08.984 --> 49:10.727
I do wish he could forget her.

49:44.770 --> 49:46.312
Forget.
