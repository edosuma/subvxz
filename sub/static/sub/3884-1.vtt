00:43.500 --> 00:47.870
<i>Based on a true story</i>

00:57.180 --> 01:03.250
<i>My Paparotti</i>

01:28.680 --> 01:31.650
I'm almost there.

01:33.380 --> 01:34.650
Yes.

01:35.190 --> 01:36.550
Okay, sir.

01:39.990 --> 01:42.460
Dragging me out on my day off...
Bastard!

02:06.480 --> 02:11.440
I'm sorry I wasn't looking.

02:12.390 --> 02:14.290
- What the hell?
- Hey!

02:14.290 --> 02:16.560
Ow, my neck!

02:17.690 --> 02:21.300
I'm sure I didn't hit you that hard.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.100
What are you, a doctor?

02:23.100 --> 02:26.200
With Farah Fawcett hair?

02:26.200 --> 02:28.100
Seriously, who wears their hair
like that anymore?

02:28.100 --> 02:30.810
That's rude coming from
someone I just met.

02:30.810 --> 02:36.250
Car accidents usually happen
between strangers.

02:36.780 --> 02:37.980
Isn't that right?

02:37.980 --> 02:41.850
I'm in a bit of a hurry now...

02:42.290 --> 02:45.650
Do we look like we've got
nothing better to do?

02:46.990 --> 02:48.750
I'll bury your sorry-ass alive.

02:51.390 --> 02:52.860
What's going on?

02:56.700 --> 02:59.570
This asshole won't
apologize for his bad.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.470
Then make him.

03:13.880 --> 03:17.950
I'm real sorry about the trouble.
This is my insurance number...

03:28.100 --> 03:29.760
That's a killer audio system.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.770
Much too good for this piece of junk.

03:36.410 --> 03:38.970
My spoiler alone is worth
more than your car.

03:39.810 --> 03:42.980
Get his card and
tell him to piss off.

03:42.980 --> 03:44.350
Yes, boss.

03:47.380 --> 03:49.750
You are almost here?
Good.

03:52.090 --> 03:55.350
Finally, a break through
for this school.

03:56.790 --> 04:01.800
The moment I heard his demo,

04:01.800 --> 04:07.070
every single hair on my body
stood on end.

04:07.300 --> 04:08.710
Even in the armpit.

04:08.710 --> 04:11.110
A true genius.
Wouldn't you agree?

04:11.110 --> 04:15.550
Maybe that's bit of an overstatement.
But he is quite special.

04:15.980 --> 04:19.779
Why are you sending your
'boy wonder' to our school?

04:19.779 --> 04:25.390
He got into a little trouble.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.490
So, he has to transfer.

04:26.490 --> 04:28.390
We're going to welcome him
with open arms.

04:28.390 --> 04:31.490
Open arms are all good

04:31.490 --> 04:33.960
but sir,

04:34.800 --> 04:37.770
this will make his fourth transfer.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.210
He's been through a lot,
that poor boy.

04:42.210 --> 04:46.770
He got expelled from your school,
didn't he?

04:46.910 --> 04:49.140
Well...

04:51.180 --> 04:53.050
Here you are!

05:00.890 --> 05:02.950
This is Lee Jang-ho.

05:03.890 --> 05:05.950
Say hello to your new principal.

05:09.700 --> 05:10.960
Morning.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.370
Good morning, sir.
I mean... Hey!

05:17.510 --> 05:18.770
What a good looking fella you are!

05:20.610 --> 05:22.940
This is the head of music department.
Say hello.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.940
Good to see you again.

05:30.490 --> 05:31.790
What's going on?

05:31.790 --> 05:34.350
You two know each other?

05:39.300 --> 05:40.400
Ow, my neck!

05:40.400 --> 05:42.800
Something wrong, Mr. Na?

05:42.800 --> 05:47.600
I'm suddenly getting
a sharp pain in my neck.

05:47.600 --> 05:52.510
Why don't you give him
a vocal test, Mr. Na?

05:52.510 --> 05:54.170
Mr. Lee?

05:54.780 --> 05:55.840
What?

06:00.880 --> 06:03.150
Yes, boss.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.750
I understand.

06:08.990 --> 06:10.150
Mr. Na,

06:12.200 --> 06:14.160
I'll take the test some other time.

06:14.500 --> 06:18.960
I've got urgent business
to take care of.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.710
Well if you gotta go,
you gotta go.

06:23.710 --> 06:24.770
Go ahead.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.370
Great.

06:27.910 --> 06:29.240
One little thing before you go.

06:36.890 --> 06:39.750
It's not
I'll take the test some other time,

06:40.290 --> 06:44.790
but "Could I take the test
some other time...?"

06:44.790 --> 06:47.060
...Sir. Okay?

06:49.400 --> 06:50.560
Off you go.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.360
Sure.

06:57.410 --> 06:58.570
Oh, and...

07:00.110 --> 07:02.780
Don't worry about the spoiler.

07:02.780 --> 07:06.240
Use the money to buy
snacks for your kids, okay?

07:12.590 --> 07:16.150
That little piece of shit!

07:17.190 --> 07:19.560
Mr. Na, can we have a word?

07:19.900 --> 07:21.700
Jang-ho left early?

07:21.700 --> 07:26.760
He has urgent business and
wishes to take it some other time.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.910
You need to sort this out.

07:28.910 --> 07:33.070
We're the ones that need him.
You, me and this school.

07:33.810 --> 07:35.840
Why are you always so twisted?

07:36.680 --> 07:38.650
Can't you be a little cooperative?

07:38.880 --> 07:43.390
You're a staff on the pay roll.
So, this isn't your problem. Fine!

07:43.390 --> 07:46.990
If you took half the interest
you have on anything...

07:46.990 --> 07:50.950
Do you want my resignation?

07:52.400 --> 07:53.860
Fine. You got it.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.600
Damned scumbags!

07:57.600 --> 07:58.860
What?

08:01.200 --> 08:04.410
This'll fall off any moment.

08:04.410 --> 08:07.110
Snack money for kids?

08:07.110 --> 08:09.240
Sang-jin! My buddy!

08:09.580 --> 08:11.280
Get off me.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.580
I'm the principal of this school.

08:12.580 --> 08:14.350
I said let go, damn it!

08:15.290 --> 08:16.790
And a very persistent man, too.

08:16.790 --> 08:19.650
Let go of me!

08:25.500 --> 08:27.160
Have a drink.

08:29.700 --> 08:33.299
Come on, it's all for
the sake of the school.

08:33.299 --> 08:38.210
I can't remember the last time
we won anything at competition.

08:38.210 --> 08:44.480
So, you brought in a thug
to sing for the school?

08:44.480 --> 08:47.540
When my late father made me
principal he said to me,

08:48.480 --> 08:50.590
'Nobility Obliges.'

08:50.590 --> 08:53.790
We all gotta do our part
for the society.

08:53.790 --> 08:59.560
Do you owe him money?
Is he threatening you?

09:00.300 --> 09:03.270
If only we didn't
go to college together...

09:03.500 --> 09:04.660
Mr. Na!

09:05.200 --> 09:07.600
What, sir?

09:07.600 --> 09:10.160
Don't try to boss me around
outside of school!

09:10.910 --> 09:16.580
I remember how my late father

09:16.580 --> 09:20.850
took you under his wings
during your worst times.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.750
How could I face him

09:24.190 --> 09:25.750
if I let the school close down?

09:26.690 --> 09:30.750
Give the boy a chance.
Please?

09:32.700 --> 09:34.300
What the hell?

09:34.300 --> 09:37.700
What have we got here?

09:37.700 --> 09:40.500
That's some fantastic needle work.

09:40.500 --> 09:44.410
Your skirt is so tight
that it won't even roll up.

09:44.410 --> 09:45.710
How do you walk in it?

09:45.710 --> 09:46.770
Very well, actually.

09:47.010 --> 09:50.240
Not only do I feel bad
for your poor skirt,

09:50.680 --> 09:54.640
but also for my eyes for
having to put up with this sight.

09:54.780 --> 09:56.950
Trouble, trouble...

09:58.290 --> 10:00.050
It's you, again.

10:00.290 --> 10:04.660
You can't be a human being.

10:07.700 --> 10:10.800
How much peroxide do you need

10:10.800 --> 10:13.900
to get a color like this?

10:13.900 --> 10:18.410
It's discolored from malnutrition.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.110
Oh yeah?

10:19.110 --> 10:21.340
Look at these bags under my eyes.

10:21.780 --> 10:24.040
Is that right?

10:25.080 --> 10:26.780
Have it tested at the crime lab.

10:26.780 --> 10:29.390
A single strand won't do.

10:29.390 --> 10:33.390
They'll need at least
a handful of samples.

10:33.390 --> 10:37.160
Bring me a pair of scissors!

10:38.900 --> 10:40.760
What a sad-looking bunch!

10:45.100 --> 10:46.570
Have a good day, boss.

10:48.710 --> 10:52.070
That him?
I heard a big guy's transferring in.

10:53.510 --> 10:54.640
How do you know it's big?

10:55.180 --> 10:56.840
I'm not talking about that, silly!

11:04.590 --> 11:05.890
What the hell?

11:05.890 --> 11:08.390
Why aren't you stopping him?

11:08.390 --> 11:09.550
Hey, you!

11:17.500 --> 11:22.060
Can you... please come here
for a second?

11:35.280 --> 11:36.250
Oh God...

11:36.990 --> 11:38.150
What's up?

11:39.890 --> 11:44.760
You should be wearing a uniform.
Right...?

11:47.900 --> 11:49.370
And the shoes...

11:51.400 --> 11:54.270
You got a problem with my shoes?

11:57.110 --> 12:00.670
I'll check the guidelines again.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.340
Although, I don't see why
they should be a problem.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.060
Who's next?

12:29.310 --> 12:30.470
Min-seok?

12:30.810 --> 12:31.970
Yes, Mr. Na.

12:45.290 --> 12:48.750
He dyed his hair, too.

12:50.990 --> 12:52.200
What?

12:52.200 --> 12:53.700
Tell me,

12:53.700 --> 12:55.060
Where do you get your hair done?

12:56.300 --> 12:58.500
Is that a tattoo on your face?

12:58.500 --> 13:02.060
What the f...?
Piss off.

13:05.510 --> 13:07.770
Wow, you smell nice.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.380
What shampoo do you use?

13:09.380 --> 13:12.280
What's going on?

13:12.280 --> 13:15.690
Nothing.
Maybe he doesn't feel like talking.

13:15.690 --> 13:19.690
Is that right?
Hey, douche bag!

13:19.690 --> 13:23.490
What do you take the school's
hardcase for?

13:23.490 --> 13:25.800
Hey...

13:25.800 --> 13:28.360
I'm talking to you.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.260
You're bleeding.

13:35.510 --> 13:38.510
No, I'm not. It's nothing.

13:38.510 --> 13:39.770
Give us a look.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.240
It's gushing out.

13:43.980 --> 13:48.890
The damn bell saved your ass, dick!

13:48.890 --> 13:51.860
What the fuck are you looking at?
Go back to your books, assholes.

13:53.990 --> 13:59.600
Why don't you paint the entire school
with blood?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.300
You got this wrong.
He started...

14:01.300 --> 14:02.460
I won't hear it.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.660
What the hell did you
do to your face?

14:06.200 --> 14:08.760
This isn't art class.

14:11.110 --> 14:13.670
Are you gonna take a swing at me?

14:21.280 --> 14:23.750
You little punks.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.200
What's this?

14:39.200 --> 14:40.670
Snack money.

14:41.900 --> 14:44.370
Order yourself a bowl
of noodles on me.

14:44.810 --> 14:46.780
30% off.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.640
- Your hairdresser...?
- Shut up.

14:59.090 --> 15:01.150
Fucking hell!

15:09.100 --> 15:15.370
Nobody will eat with you
because of your stinky temper?

15:15.810 --> 15:17.070
Let me join you.

15:20.110 --> 15:24.740
I get indigestion
from eating with people.

15:25.380 --> 15:28.350
Jang-ho hasn't come into school
for days.

15:30.390 --> 15:31.750
Did you call him?

15:33.390 --> 15:35.090
I've been busy.

15:35.090 --> 15:37.960
Too busy to carry out
your teacher's duties?

15:39.600 --> 15:42.900
Fine. I'll call him.

15:42.900 --> 15:46.000
Stop acting like you've got
ants in your pants

15:46.000 --> 15:46.970
and sit down for a moment.

15:54.010 --> 15:55.030
Here.

15:57.180 --> 16:00.880
This is his address.

16:00.880 --> 16:04.150
He lives close by from you.

16:04.490 --> 16:08.390
Why don't you pick him up
on your way to school?

16:08.390 --> 16:11.050
It'll be nice to have someone
to keep you company.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.100
Think it'll make any difference?

16:15.100 --> 16:21.370
He won't change.
He's a piece of crap.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.870
How can you tell without
giving him a shot?

16:27.310 --> 16:28.940
Oh, my poor father...

16:30.080 --> 16:32.950
your son is treated like
a piece of shit by his colleagues.

16:34.180 --> 16:35.480
Mr. Na!

16:35.480 --> 16:39.050
It's about time you do something
for this school.

16:39.390 --> 16:43.950
The school doesn't run on
air and water.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.060
Bring me Jang-ho
or your resignation.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.500
Something going on
between you two?

16:55.500 --> 16:58.210
I hear rumors that you've been
making out in the school.

16:58.210 --> 17:02.240
- That's absurd!
- God, no!

17:04.280 --> 17:06.040
Turn it off.

17:19.900 --> 17:23.200
Why are you sleeping here?

17:23.200 --> 17:25.359
I'll go under the bed.

17:40.580 --> 17:43.350
Buzz at your own risk?

17:44.090 --> 17:46.750
Damn thugs...

17:47.790 --> 17:52.750
Scum of society!

17:56.900 --> 17:58.160
Man...

18:16.090 --> 18:17.250
Oh, fuck it!

18:24.290 --> 18:25.850
I don't believe this...

18:50.190 --> 18:52.750
Who the fuck is this?

18:57.590 --> 19:00.400
Who sent you?
A hit man?

19:00.400 --> 19:01.800
You got this all wrong.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.400
The Fender bender?

19:03.400 --> 19:04.660
What's going on?

19:04.800 --> 19:08.970
Boss, it's the fender bender punk
from the other day.

19:11.010 --> 19:11.810
Mr. Na?

19:11.810 --> 19:15.080
Mr. Na? Is that his alias?

19:15.080 --> 19:15.880
He's my teacher.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.040
Your teacher, boss?

19:17.780 --> 19:19.480
Good morning, sir.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.480
Morning...

19:20.480 --> 19:22.640
What brings you here so early?

19:23.090 --> 19:24.250
Let's go.

19:24.990 --> 19:26.290
Go where?

19:26.290 --> 19:27.450
What do you think, you pr...?

19:27.790 --> 19:29.660
The school!

19:33.700 --> 19:36.400
You changed your ride?

19:36.400 --> 19:38.260
- It's not the same junk?
- No, it's not.

19:38.700 --> 19:40.900
Either woman nor car
is not a used one.

19:40.900 --> 19:43.070
- See you boys later.
- Yes, boss.

19:43.410 --> 19:44.960
- Call me if anything happens.
- Yes, sir.

19:45.210 --> 19:46.870
Have a good day, boss.

19:48.480 --> 19:52.350
You upgraded from
a wreck to a junk.

19:52.680 --> 19:54.880
Let's roll.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.440
Have a good day, boss.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.260
Piece of shit!

20:20.510 --> 20:21.640
Are you done?

20:21.880 --> 20:22.850
Yes.

20:24.380 --> 20:26.750
What's the title of this song?

20:27.180 --> 20:28.340
The Trout.

20:29.180 --> 20:30.690
A live trout or a dead one?

20:30.690 --> 20:31.790
How would I know?

20:31.790 --> 20:33.890
That's what's wrong with you.

20:33.890 --> 20:35.950
Is he for real?

20:51.410 --> 20:53.810
- Suk-hui?
- Yeah?

20:53.810 --> 20:55.840
You majored in dance last year,
didn't you?

20:57.480 --> 20:58.380
Yup.

20:58.380 --> 21:00.140
Why did you change to
voice this year?

21:00.580 --> 21:01.740
Mr. Na,

21:03.990 --> 21:05.550
I never knew I would get so big.

21:08.990 --> 21:10.550
What will you do next year?

21:11.690 --> 21:13.600
Continue singing?

21:13.600 --> 21:14.860
Find yourself a husband.

21:15.800 --> 21:20.070
Get married and enjoy the life
singing and dancing away.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.170
Go to your seat.

21:30.580 --> 21:31.880
That's all for today.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.440
Thank you, Mr. Na.

21:39.590 --> 21:40.850
What the hell?

21:42.390 --> 21:44.090
Why'd you drag me here,

21:44.090 --> 21:46.000
if you weren't gonna teach me anything?

21:46.000 --> 21:49.160
Because the principal asked me to.

21:56.210 --> 21:58.070
Aren't we gonna train?

22:03.380 --> 22:09.150
Would you want to teach a thug
if you were me?

22:10.990 --> 22:13.550
Do you have to
keep calling me a thug?

22:13.890 --> 22:17.050
Because you are a thug.
Aren't you?

22:17.790 --> 22:20.560
Aren't thugs allowed to sing?

22:22.200 --> 22:24.460
Classic isn't country music.

22:24.700 --> 22:29.260
It's not something
you take lightly.

22:29.810 --> 22:32.010
I'm not doing it for a laugh.

22:32.010 --> 22:35.740
I didn't know that music discriminated.

22:36.780 --> 22:40.240
I don't wanna learn from
a stuck-up old fart either.

22:41.180 --> 22:42.340
'Old fart'?

22:43.690 --> 22:44.850
Fine!

22:45.490 --> 22:51.490
Do as you please.
A singing thug? Nice!

22:51.490 --> 22:55.200
I'd rather scatter manure

22:55.200 --> 22:59.360
on those who have potentials.

23:02.700 --> 23:06.310
Am I a goddamn carrot?

23:06.310 --> 23:07.810
What manure? Rank!

23:07.810 --> 23:12.250
Guess what?
You're not the only vocal coach around!

23:14.480 --> 23:17.190
Did you bring my coupon?

23:17.190 --> 23:18.150
No.

23:19.690 --> 23:25.560
That's no way to treat a regular customer.

23:25.890 --> 23:31.460
You should take pride in your job
no matter how trivial it may be.

23:46.380 --> 23:47.680
Large portion?

23:47.680 --> 23:49.050
Yes, sir.

24:12.610 --> 24:16.740
Not a soul to eat lunch with
in the entire school. Loner!

24:20.580 --> 24:23.050
They bully among teachers, too?

24:24.590 --> 24:26.560
How piss weak!

24:31.390 --> 24:34.960
It means you don't
want anything to do with it.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.870
Are you done with the phone call?

24:45.710 --> 24:48.940
Nah. I can't get reception
in the hall.

24:54.180 --> 24:56.240
Who is it this time?

24:56.790 --> 24:58.450
Good reception here.

24:59.390 --> 25:00.550
Yes, boss.

25:01.090 --> 25:03.250
Him again?

25:05.590 --> 25:06.560
Now?

25:07.700 --> 25:10.000
I'll be right there, sir.

25:10.000 --> 25:10.970
Hey!

25:13.300 --> 25:14.960
Look at this.

25:15.300 --> 25:19.670
This is 100% fake.

25:20.410 --> 25:25.640
You shouldn't add tap water
to the whiskey that you sell.

25:25.780 --> 25:27.680
Because that's wrong.

25:27.680 --> 25:29.080
Wrong.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.790
Terrible practice.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.650
No, no, no!

25:35.690 --> 25:37.060
You

25:37.690 --> 25:40.960
Are you in charge here?

25:41.800 --> 25:46.570
This is your judgment day.

25:47.800 --> 25:48.960
Look.

25:49.610 --> 25:51.210
I'm calling the cops.

25:51.210 --> 25:52.470
Call them.

25:54.210 --> 25:56.840
I will. I'm dialing.

25:59.980 --> 26:02.080
Do you want me to call for you?

26:02.080 --> 26:03.290
Argh!

26:03.290 --> 26:05.090
Ow! Argh!

26:05.090 --> 26:05.790
Did you see that?

26:05.790 --> 26:07.790
Did you see
what he did to me?

26:07.790 --> 26:10.490
Go on, why don't you kill me?

26:10.490 --> 26:13.000
You picked the wrong guy to mess with.
Bring it on.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.960
Argh! My head!

26:18.600 --> 26:22.100
Is this a school or a club?

26:22.100 --> 26:25.070
You sent us a thug to work with.

26:26.710 --> 26:27.910
<i>Well...</i>

26:27.910 --> 26:31.880
For all you know,
he could put a knife through me.

26:31.880 --> 26:34.280
Will you take responsibility?

26:34.280 --> 26:35.980
<i>That's why you should be careful.</i>

26:35.980 --> 26:37.250
What the hell, man?

26:37.890 --> 26:40.590
Don't come to my funeral!

26:40.590 --> 26:42.090
Don't you pay tribute either.

26:42.090 --> 26:43.890
<i>Calm down, man.</i>

26:43.890 --> 26:47.350
I've got a call coming in.
Don't hang up.

26:50.100 --> 26:52.070
Gimcheon Arts High.

26:54.500 --> 26:55.660
Hello?

26:57.910 --> 27:00.270
He got into trouble already.

27:00.610 --> 27:02.740
Hello?

27:10.590 --> 27:12.750
Lee Jang-ho,

27:13.490 --> 27:15.350
student at Gimcheon Arts High...

27:17.190 --> 27:20.100
Student by day and
a gang banger by night,

27:20.100 --> 27:21.760
you must be so busy.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.370
He must be your favorite student.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.070
Very touching.
I'll let him off this time.

27:30.510 --> 27:32.910
Thank you, officer.

27:32.910 --> 27:35.430
Anyone can study voice these days?

27:45.890 --> 27:50.660
Do you need high school diploma
to be a gangster these days?

27:51.090 --> 27:53.300
That's not why I go to school.

27:53.300 --> 27:54.660
Why then?

27:55.900 --> 27:57.460
I just love singing.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.470
You haven't heard me singing yet.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.510
When you become my age,

28:04.510 --> 28:06.110
you don't have to taste it

28:06.110 --> 28:09.240
to know that shit is shit.

28:12.780 --> 28:14.340
I ain't no shit.

28:26.290 --> 28:30.660
It's really hot today.
Have some cold drink.

28:30.900 --> 28:32.370
Thank you, ma'am.

28:35.200 --> 28:38.310
What a handsome fella!

28:38.310 --> 28:41.680
Mom, is he a gangster?

28:41.680 --> 28:44.680
Give us some privacy.

28:44.680 --> 28:47.550
Yes
Let's get out of here.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.290
He's so cool.

28:51.290 --> 28:52.650
And handsome, too.

28:57.390 --> 28:58.660
What are you going to sing?

28:59.690 --> 29:00.960
Anything?

29:02.900 --> 29:04.060
Which song?

29:10.410 --> 29:11.770
E lucevan le stelle

29:17.880 --> 29:19.040
You don't know it?

29:19.880 --> 29:21.940
Why don't you pick something
you can actually sing?

29:22.480 --> 29:23.650
No. It's good.

29:30.090 --> 29:31.460
Fine, then.

29:47.610 --> 29:49.130
What are you doing?

29:49.980 --> 29:51.840
Warming up.

33:12.880 --> 33:15.250
And you called me shit.

33:24.090 --> 33:25.750
You went to the cop shop?

33:26.190 --> 33:27.860
It wasn't shit.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.860
Gotta be careful with customers
even the most fucked-up ones.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.500
If you get kicked out of school again...

33:33.500 --> 33:34.870
I'm sorry, boss.

33:41.480 --> 33:44.340
Did he make you stand in the corner?

33:45.380 --> 33:51.340
Actually, he must be troubled by now.

33:51.590 --> 33:53.650
You little piece of shit!

33:55.790 --> 34:02.060
He's quite a singer, isn't he?

34:04.500 --> 34:08.900
Be a man and give him
some credit that he deserves.

34:08.900 --> 34:11.110
Let me eat in peace!

34:11.110 --> 34:13.170
But you are eating it.

34:13.710 --> 34:16.139
Gangster tenor flipping rocks!

34:16.480 --> 34:18.639
Language!

34:21.980 --> 34:23.250
Don't eat all of that.

34:23.380 --> 34:25.190
Can you share?

34:25.190 --> 34:28.650
I asked you to make it.

34:31.489 --> 34:32.650
So, it's mine.

34:39.800 --> 34:45.570
<i>from the country boy</i>
<i>to the hero of the Carnegie Hall</i>

34:47.909 --> 34:50.040
Gimcheon Arts High School.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.480
One moment, please.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.949
Mr. Na, it's for you.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.050
Mr. Na?

34:57.390 --> 34:58.190
Yes?

34:58.190 --> 35:01.350
It's the Daegu Singing Competition
wanting to speak to the head of music.

35:05.190 --> 35:07.250
Hello. Na speaking.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.960
Lee Jang-ho?

35:15.700 --> 35:18.670
How dare he do this to me!

35:22.780 --> 35:24.140
Hey! Daegu Competition!

35:28.680 --> 35:30.050
Deok-saeng!

35:38.390 --> 35:39.390
Come here, you!

35:39.390 --> 35:41.700
Jang Deok-saeng!

35:41.700 --> 35:44.200
You signed him up.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.800
Shouldn't you be in the class, Mr. Na?

35:46.800 --> 35:49.770
You wrote a goddamn
recommendation for him.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.610
You mean Daegu Competition?

35:52.610 --> 35:55.180
Without consulting with me first!

35:55.180 --> 35:57.580
How dare you take me for shit?

35:57.580 --> 36:02.140
Did Jang-ho make it
to the main competition?

36:03.280 --> 36:04.990
Good for him!

36:04.990 --> 36:05.990
Damn you!

36:05.990 --> 36:08.790
Come here, you.

36:08.790 --> 36:12.090
Shouldn't you get busy now?

36:12.090 --> 36:12.890
What?

36:12.890 --> 36:16.000
You've got no time to waste.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.500
He really keeps on impressing you,
doesn't he?

36:19.500 --> 36:23.100
- I said come here.
- Come on, buddy.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.210
What?

36:24.210 --> 36:25.670
Did you get my text message?

36:26.310 --> 36:30.240
- What message?
- Class reunion tomorrow night.

36:31.080 --> 36:32.240
Let's talk about this tomorrow, okay?

36:34.680 --> 36:36.550
Urgh!

36:42.990 --> 36:44.150
Lee Jang-ho!

36:45.990 --> 36:50.760
It's eel rice.
You know what it's good for?

36:51.300 --> 36:53.060
I'm allergic to eels.

36:53.600 --> 36:54.760
Are you embarrassed?

36:55.900 --> 36:58.510
I know you're lying
because you're embarrassed.

36:58.510 --> 37:00.370
What...I

37:00.910 --> 37:02.080
What do you stutter?

37:02.080 --> 37:03.340
I didn't.

37:03.880 --> 37:07.040
Piss off when I tell you nicely.

37:08.880 --> 37:14.950
Are you nervous to be
in a confined space with me?

37:15.290 --> 37:16.290
I said piss off.

37:16.290 --> 37:20.350
Why would I?

37:21.700 --> 37:23.200
Desperate to see blood?

37:23.200 --> 37:26.170
So tough yet incredibly talented.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.260
What do you think about me?

37:28.800 --> 37:30.000
Wh...what?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.870
You're doing it again.

37:33.510 --> 37:35.640
For fuck's sake!

37:39.880 --> 37:41.250
Keep on with the good work.

37:42.580 --> 37:44.550
Go, Jang-ho!

37:44.990 --> 37:47.050
Is she out of her fucking mind?

37:49.690 --> 37:50.950
Cheers!

37:52.590 --> 37:53.750
Cheers.

37:54.300 --> 37:57.000
You'll be lonely in Italy.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
I've made arrangements for that.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.100
You never disappoint me.

38:00.100 --> 38:01.400
Thanks, man.

38:01.400 --> 38:05.710
How was the Carnegie Hall recital?

38:05.710 --> 38:06.910
Great venue, eh?

38:06.910 --> 38:09.580
Acoustics are amazing.

38:09.580 --> 38:13.040
The sound travels so powerfully.

38:13.280 --> 38:16.080
It's a truly wonderful venue.

38:16.080 --> 38:19.690
Wonderful Carnegie!

38:19.690 --> 38:22.250
Wonderful!

38:23.090 --> 38:27.650
That's fucking beautiful.

38:28.700 --> 38:33.100
Do you want me to fix you a drink?

38:33.100 --> 38:34.200
Forget it.

38:34.200 --> 38:37.510
Sang-jin was truly wonderful.

38:37.510 --> 38:40.870
Getting an offer from
the Italian opera company and all.

38:43.580 --> 38:44.740
Hey!

38:45.280 --> 38:49.280
Your way of jeering,
doesn't it ever bother you?

38:49.280 --> 38:52.290
You two have been like this
since college days

38:52.290 --> 38:53.950
Why don't we try to be friends now?

38:54.990 --> 38:58.650
I heard you're teaching now.
In the countryside.

39:00.900 --> 39:03.500
I don't know if you can handle that.

39:03.500 --> 39:06.370
- Come on, man.
- Such a promising star you were

39:06.600 --> 39:08.660
and you ended up
in the middle of nowhere.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.570
Are you so proud of the tenure
you bought off with money?

39:15.180 --> 39:18.640
If it wasn't for the throat tumor,

39:20.280 --> 39:24.650
things would've turned out
quite differently.

39:25.290 --> 39:30.050
It could've been 'perfecto.'

39:34.400 --> 39:38.770
Perfect, my ass!

40:22.180 --> 40:23.340
Yes, boss.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.640
Yes, sir.
I'm out taking care of some business.

40:27.780 --> 40:28.980
Yes, sir.

40:28.980 --> 40:30.280
<i>The big boss wants you.</i>

40:30.280 --> 40:31.450
Really?

40:32.190 --> 40:34.250
I'll be on my way.

40:50.710 --> 40:52.260
Who did this?

40:55.880 --> 40:57.040
Him?

41:01.980 --> 41:06.050
This kid did this to all of you?

41:20.900 --> 41:22.560
Why don't you take him
under your wing?

41:28.180 --> 41:29.340
Did you eat?

41:31.980 --> 41:34.850
Come on.
What do you feel like?

41:37.690 --> 41:40.050
Have you thought this over?

41:41.790 --> 41:42.850
Yes, I did.

41:44.590 --> 41:48.460
Will I stay in a camp
with the brothers?

41:50.300 --> 41:52.100
When you're all by yourself,

41:52.100 --> 41:55.160
it gets so quiet
that you can't sleep.

41:56.100 --> 41:57.660
There were times

41:58.310 --> 42:00.970
when I didn't utter a single word
for three days.

42:01.310 --> 42:02.640
Three days?

42:03.680 --> 42:05.840
You can't just talk to yourself,
can you?

42:09.280 --> 42:12.250
You've got no siblings?

42:13.090 --> 42:16.460
I've been living alone
since gran died.

42:21.400 --> 42:23.160
Well, think it over carefully
once again.

42:24.300 --> 42:26.160
It might seem all good now

42:26.600 --> 42:30.370
but death is the only way out.

43:19.790 --> 43:20.850
Boss,

43:21.090 --> 43:24.390
I saw it on TV.

43:24.390 --> 43:26.160
They all wear black for competitions.

43:27.300 --> 43:29.660
How about this, boss?

43:30.200 --> 43:32.000
I got the bow tie.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.260
I got it off one of the waiters.
Nice, eh?

43:34.600 --> 43:35.970
Are you fucking kidding me?

43:36.300 --> 43:38.710
Who wears stuff like that these days?

43:38.710 --> 43:40.410
That Permarotti-guy you like,

43:40.410 --> 43:42.540
he wears a bow tie all the times.

43:44.280 --> 43:46.040
How many times do I have to tell you?

43:46.780 --> 43:51.550
It's Pavarotti, not Parmarotti.

43:51.890 --> 43:53.390
Learn what you don't know.

43:53.390 --> 43:54.790
Learn, man.

43:54.790 --> 43:56.050
Wasn't he called Permarotti
because of his permed hair?

43:56.490 --> 43:58.860
Come on, man.

44:15.480 --> 44:17.240
Go, boss!

44:19.980 --> 44:21.950
Who are these people?

44:48.580 --> 44:50.940
If it wasn't for
these fucked up threads.

44:51.980 --> 44:54.850
Shiny silver, damn it.

45:06.590 --> 45:10.300
Chicken feet and
a bottle of soju, please.

45:10.300 --> 45:12.060
Yes,Sir.

45:24.080 --> 45:26.240
Keep your chin up.

45:26.980 --> 45:30.150
What the hell?

45:34.690 --> 45:38.060
I'm still your teacher.

45:38.290 --> 45:39.850
Put that bottle away.

45:43.500 --> 45:44.560
Here.

45:45.600 --> 45:47.260
I don't eat chicken feet.

45:48.700 --> 45:50.860
There are things you can't eat?

45:51.810 --> 45:53.110
It's nasty.

45:53.110 --> 45:55.740
You're the nasty one.

45:57.480 --> 45:58.740
Embarrassed, right?

45:59.180 --> 46:05.390
You thought you'd win
something easily.

46:05.390 --> 46:07.150
And here you are,
empty handed.

46:11.090 --> 46:16.460
You and your ridiculous silver suit.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.500
What kind of a classical
vocal performer

46:20.500 --> 46:22.160
doesn't have a tux?

46:24.000 --> 46:27.710
It should be about your skills,
not stupid suits.

46:27.710 --> 46:34.140
Don't talk about skills,
when you can't even stand straight

46:36.780 --> 46:38.950
As if you ever taught me howl

46:42.090 --> 46:46.460
Did you come at the competition?

46:51.800 --> 46:54.800
Man, my tongue's on fire.

46:54.800 --> 46:57.770
To check out your shitty student?

47:00.210 --> 47:01.330
You were shit alright.

47:02.180 --> 47:05.640
Your enunciation and
emotional expression were just shit.

47:07.380 --> 47:13.690
Your singing is nothing more than
mimicking. Like a parrot.

47:13.690 --> 47:16.160
Nobody is picture perfect.

47:17.590 --> 47:19.750
How can I know when
I haven't been taught?

47:20.490 --> 47:27.160
I have no business teaching
the unwilling.

47:41.080 --> 47:45.250
Then, teach me.

48:05.710 --> 48:07.370
Good.

48:08.080 --> 48:09.180
I'm confiscating this.

48:09.180 --> 48:11.180
No, not that,
it cost me a fortune.

48:11.180 --> 48:12.840
Quit smoking, dumbass.

48:14.880 --> 48:17.550
What kind of singer
smokes cigarette?

48:24.290 --> 48:25.450
Jang-ho,

48:28.200 --> 48:31.560
if you're gonna do this,
do it right.

48:33.200 --> 48:34.670
Alright?

48:39.310 --> 48:40.410
Where are you going?

48:40.410 --> 48:43.040
To take a leak, asshole.

48:53.890 --> 48:55.050
Are we late?

48:55.990 --> 48:57.150
Not yet.

48:57.790 --> 48:59.290
Then, why are we running?

48:59.290 --> 49:00.960
Because they're running, too.

49:01.500 --> 49:03.050
Why are they running?

49:03.500 --> 49:05.060
I don't know.

49:06.200 --> 49:07.700
What is this?

49:07.700 --> 49:09.970
You started running first.

49:11.110 --> 49:13.770
Hey, it's your lover boy.

49:17.080 --> 49:19.680
He must have had a change of heart.

49:19.680 --> 49:22.880
He's wearing his uniform.

49:22.880 --> 49:24.590
Duck boat ride this weekend?

49:24.590 --> 49:27.190
Forget duck boat.
Let's gets some roast duck.

49:27.190 --> 49:28.250
Oh my God!

49:29.490 --> 49:30.960
Morning.

49:32.690 --> 49:34.750
Are you crazy?

49:35.100 --> 49:36.760
That prick...

49:44.300 --> 49:46.270
- Jin-ju.
- Yeah?

49:46.710 --> 49:52.580
Schubert wrote this piece after
watching trouts playing merrily.

49:52.580 --> 49:56.280
It mustn't be sung heavily.
Not like frozen fish.

49:56.280 --> 49:59.850
Pollacks usually come frozen.

50:01.490 --> 50:04.790
Which is your fish?

50:04.790 --> 50:07.800
A fresh, succulent
one full of vigor...

50:07.800 --> 50:11.060
Enough talks of sashimi.

50:11.800 --> 50:15.800
Focus on your trout, okay?

50:15.800 --> 50:16.770
Yes, Mr. Na.

50:33.090 --> 50:34.250
Do you want to stop?

50:35.390 --> 50:36.550
Yes, Mr. Na.

50:37.790 --> 50:43.300
When I look at your gesture
and emotional expression

50:43.300 --> 50:46.560
you're a budding prima donna.

50:48.600 --> 50:50.300
What's this song called?

50:50.300 --> 50:51.810
'Forbidden song.'

50:51.810 --> 50:53.870
Singing is forbidden for you
from this moment.

50:55.280 --> 50:58.140
Because you can't lip sync arias.

50:58.980 --> 51:00.540
What's your dream?

51:02.180 --> 51:03.740
Getting married.

51:03.880 --> 51:05.590
I figured.

51:05.590 --> 51:09.050
Go on get married.
Sooner the better.

51:09.990 --> 51:10.890
Back to your seat.

51:10.890 --> 51:12.550
Remember, you're forbidden
from singing from now.

51:20.100 --> 51:21.260
Lee Jang-ho.

51:22.500 --> 51:23.660
Yes?

51:24.000 --> 51:25.470
Aren't you going to sing?

51:26.410 --> 51:27.370
Excuse me?

51:36.280 --> 51:38.340
Aren't you going to sing?

51:39.790 --> 51:41.850
I am, I am.

51:43.690 --> 51:45.560
What were you looking at?

51:47.590 --> 51:48.560
At the sheet music.

51:50.800 --> 51:52.560
You can't read music?

52:04.780 --> 52:06.040
Scooch on over.

52:10.080 --> 52:12.140
Are you kidding me? Closer.

52:18.190 --> 52:22.360
What will you do for me

52:23.100 --> 52:24.560
if I teach you how to read music?

52:26.100 --> 52:27.260
Um... dinner?

52:31.000 --> 52:32.970
What do you want?

52:35.280 --> 52:36.440
That thing

52:37.680 --> 52:38.840
that you're thinking about

52:40.880 --> 52:42.540
right now.

52:44.280 --> 52:46.150
I wasn't thinking anything.

52:49.790 --> 52:51.050
Don't be naive.

52:51.590 --> 52:53.650
I'll teach you for free.

52:55.100 --> 52:56.560
Watch carefully.

52:58.800 --> 53:00.900
G B D F

53:00.900 --> 53:03.100
So le ti fa

53:03.100 --> 53:04.970
Great Big Dogs Fight.

53:06.010 --> 53:07.010
Fight what?

53:07.010 --> 53:08.530
That's how you memorize it.

53:09.180 --> 53:12.080
G B D F

53:12.080 --> 53:15.780
'Great Big Dogs Fight.'
Okay.

53:15.780 --> 53:17.580
- Got it?
- I got it.

53:17.580 --> 53:20.190
- And A C E G?
- What's that?

53:20.190 --> 53:21.290
All Cows Expel Gas.

53:21.290 --> 53:22.290
'All Cows Expel Gas.'

53:22.290 --> 53:24.190
Do I have to explain again?
You said you got it.

53:24.190 --> 53:25.060
Alright. Alright.

53:41.780 --> 53:43.240
What's this?

53:45.680 --> 53:46.940
'Great Big Dogs Fight.'

53:47.280 --> 53:48.250
What?

53:48.880 --> 53:50.150
G B D F

53:52.990 --> 53:54.150
And this?

53:55.690 --> 53:57.750
'All Cows Expel Gas.'

53:59.590 --> 54:00.960
A C E G

54:02.900 --> 54:07.800
Do you have to do that thing?

54:07.800 --> 54:08.900
I got that right though.

54:08.900 --> 54:10.060
You've done some work.

54:11.310 --> 54:14.470
I can do anything once
I put my mind to it.

54:14.780 --> 54:16.680
It's not that hard.

54:16.680 --> 54:20.140
No, it's not.

54:20.780 --> 54:22.440
Hello, sir.

54:24.790 --> 54:28.050
It's nice to see you work together.

54:28.490 --> 54:29.890
- Mr. Na.
- Yeah?

54:29.890 --> 54:32.760
Does he have potential?

54:34.190 --> 54:37.560
- Sure does.
- Is that right?

54:39.000 --> 54:42.370
Have a look at this, Jang-ho.

54:43.200 --> 54:43.970
What's that?

54:45.410 --> 54:46.460
This flyer?

54:46.910 --> 54:50.280
Flyer... right.

54:50.280 --> 54:52.280
It's about the most prestigious
singing competition.

54:52.280 --> 54:55.840
Sejong Competition.

54:56.580 --> 54:58.640
Awesome.

55:02.690 --> 55:05.250
Are you interested?
Wanna go for it?

55:07.590 --> 55:09.400
- Me?
- Yes, you.

55:09.400 --> 55:11.100
- Sir,
- Come out here, sir.

55:11.100 --> 55:14.800
may I have a word with you?

55:14.800 --> 55:16.100
Outside?

55:16.100 --> 55:19.370
Let's talk here.
It's hot out.

55:25.280 --> 55:27.540
A word, please?

55:28.080 --> 55:30.080
No need for the serious face.

55:30.080 --> 55:31.790
It's boiling hot outside.

55:31.790 --> 55:35.950
I'm telling you I want to
discuss something with you.

55:37.290 --> 55:38.550
Alright.

55:54.880 --> 55:56.040
Hey!

55:56.580 --> 56:00.880
What kind of monkey business
are you trying to pull?

56:00.880 --> 56:03.150
Come on, you know what I want.

56:03.480 --> 56:06.540
I want him to win the grand prize
and help restore the school's reputation.

56:07.090 --> 56:10.790
- Grand prize, huh?
- Yeah!

56:10.790 --> 56:12.590
The boy can't even read music.

56:12.590 --> 56:14.590
That's only a minor problem.

56:14.590 --> 56:19.000
What's the title of
a Tom Cruise movie?

56:19.000 --> 56:20.800
- Tom Cruise?
- Yes.

56:20.800 --> 56:23.300
- Mission Impossible?
- Come again?

56:23.300 --> 56:24.200
Mission impossible.

56:24.200 --> 56:27.370
That's what this is.
A mission impossible.

56:27.810 --> 56:31.480
That's why your contribution
is crucial.

56:31.480 --> 56:33.080
Come on.

56:33.080 --> 56:35.640
This is a mission impossible.
Down to the letter.

56:36.080 --> 56:38.250
Why don't you do it yourself?

56:38.690 --> 56:41.850
Father, this school you built
with your bare hands

56:42.390 --> 56:44.090
it's about to go to pieces
thanks to your protégé.

56:44.090 --> 56:48.460
Will you stop dropping
the father card?

56:51.200 --> 56:52.260
Mr. Na,

56:53.200 --> 56:55.600
it's all on your shoulders now.

56:55.600 --> 56:56.700
I'm counting on you, man.

56:56.700 --> 56:58.810
Take a look at the flyer.
I mean, the pamphlet.

56:58.810 --> 57:02.180
Hey!
Damn you...

57:02.180 --> 57:05.150
I said no making out
in the school premises.

57:05.380 --> 57:06.640
We weren't.

57:07.780 --> 57:08.980
Never mind. Just continue.

57:08.980 --> 57:10.540
But we weren't doing anything!

57:16.790 --> 57:24.160
Only the best budding vocalists
will sing at this competition.

57:24.500 --> 57:26.800
I understand how you feel but

57:26.800 --> 57:30.000
don't bite off more than
you can chew.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.270
Well, bring on the challenge.

57:34.410 --> 57:37.740
Do you really want to be
in this competition?

57:38.480 --> 57:39.450
Yes.

57:39.780 --> 57:42.340
What will you sing?

57:43.880 --> 57:44.850
'Nessun Dorma'

57:54.390 --> 57:56.450
Is there a problem?

57:57.400 --> 57:59.760
Can you hit high C?

58:01.300 --> 58:03.200
The soda?

58:03.200 --> 58:05.710
No, not the soda brand!

58:05.710 --> 58:10.230
You've got to be able to hit high C
in order to sing that song.

58:10.880 --> 58:12.540
I'm gonna sing it anyway.

58:15.080 --> 58:17.980
Why don't we pick something else?

58:17.980 --> 58:20.790
No. I want 'Nessun Dorma.'

58:20.790 --> 58:23.050
Why?

58:25.490 --> 58:26.860
Because I have to.

58:34.700 --> 58:38.370
<i>When I was little,</i>
<i>I lived with my grandmother.</i>

58:39.310 --> 58:43.330
<i>People used to call me a genius</i>
<i>when they heard me sing.</i>

58:44.280 --> 58:48.440
<i>Gran was so proud of me, too.</i>

58:49.680 --> 58:53.750
<i>I had this CD that</i>
<i>I won as a prize.</i>

58:54.890 --> 58:58.450
<i>I loved it so much and</i>
<i>that's how fell in love with opera.</i>

59:00.090 --> 59:02.960
<i>That song was 'Nessun Dorma.'</i>

59:04.900 --> 59:08.860
<i>Nobody cared when my gran died.</i>

59:10.500 --> 59:15.240
<i>But when Paparotti died,</i>
<i>it was on the news everywhere.</i>

59:15.980 --> 59:19.240
<i>They played his rendition of</i>
<i>'Nessun Dorma' all day.</i>

59:20.780 --> 59:24.150
<i>That's when I told myself</i>

59:25.790 --> 59:28.950
<i>that I'll become</i>
<i>a tenor just like him</i>

59:29.590 --> 59:35.860
<i>and sing 'Nessun Dorma'</i>
<i>on a big stage.</i>

59:45.610 --> 59:47.160
Such a pain in the ass.

59:48.070 --> 59:50.440
Of all good songs out there...

59:58.590 --> 01:00:00.190
You alright, Mr. Na?

01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:02.050
I'm not, you prick.

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:04.150
Am I your chauffeur?

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.300
<i>If you don't want to look like</i>
<i>an idiot at the competition,</i>

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:16.600
<i>you're gonna have to</i>
<i>work your ass off.</i>

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.570
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:20.610
Drop the nasal voice,
for God's sake!

01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:22.180
Are you trying to be
a country singer?

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:23.280
I'm sorry, boss.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.640
- What?
- I mean, sir.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.680
Again from the beginning.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.840
Yes, boss.

01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:42.900
Motherfuckers!

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.460
Christ!
I almost crashed, you bastard.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.560
Did we crash?

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:56.780
Are you trying to be a climber?

01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:01.080
Use minimal gesture to
convey emotion.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.140
This much?

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:05.650
That's kneading.

01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:13.790
Where are you going every weekend?

01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:15.350
Are you seeing someone else?

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.260
Hello?

01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:28.330
Lee Jang-ho

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.840
Do you know what 'vincere' means?

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:31.950
Victory.

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:35.740
You know the meaning of that word
and that's all you can manage?

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:37.280
Is it good?

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.250
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:41.250
It can't be.

01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:45.390
Shall I try that
again Paparotti style?

01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:46.690
I can sound exactly like him.

01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:48.860
Who's Paparotti?

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.160
Your father?

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.200
It's 'Pavarotti,' you idiot!

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.570
Pavarotti...?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.210
Are you trying to
get yourself killed?

01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:00.570
Excuse me!

01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:08.180
Forget Pavarotti or Paparotti.

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:09.280
Forget Domingo.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.050
Find your own voice.
Lee Jang-ho's own unique sound.

01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:15.650
Your songs sound all the same
whether it's a love song or a sad song.

01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:17.860
There is no emotion in your songs.

01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:20.160
Parting, love...

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:22.660
How am I supposed to know
what that feels like?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.970
Let's start with romance.

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.870
I made a selection taking into
account your intellectual level.

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:34.770
My intellectual level?

01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:35.680
Elementary school boy.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.340
Forget it. I'm not watching it.

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:41.740
I'm a scumbag. The worst scumbag.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:46.850
I'm a scumbag. The worst scumbag.

01:02:50.590 --> 01:02:53.860
Is he a true gangster or what?

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:01.060
Man, he's killing me.

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.330
I know this song.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.240
'The one who gives me happiness'

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.440
How do you know it?
It's an old song.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.250
It's my dad's favoring song.

01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:22.650
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:32.100
<i>If I'm on the way tough and far</i>

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.760
<i>I'd like to go with you</i>

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:43.430
Here we go.
All the way to the end!

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:45.080
'Four go'!

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.780
You rock, man.

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:49.440
Dad, you're screwed.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:54.750
It could've been worse.

01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:58.250
I'll take the chicken head.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.370
Yes!

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.660
A joker! Looking good.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.770
That's the way to go.

01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:14.830
Just one more.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.640
I collect two cards from you.
I'm saved.

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:25.740
Just one more.

01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:29.760
You're dead, dad.

01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:33.550
Jang-ho, have some fruit.

01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:35.150
I'm good. Thanks, man.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.100
You don't like fruits?

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:39.700
I eat plenty at the club.

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:41.500
You little piece of crap!

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:44.900
Don't talk about clubs
in front of the kid!

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:46.410
This is bullshit!

01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:49.480
What? What!
Gambling's bad.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.680
Do you know how much
you just blew?

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.780
Go to your room, Ji-min.

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:54.440
What a grudge!

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:11.060
How dare you ignore my call?

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:13.360
You don't care to live anymore?

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:16.770
I'm so sorry, boss.

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:21.170
I'm making an exception for you
so you can have a school diploma.

01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:23.740
Get your shit together.

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:27.050
Before I put an end to it all.

01:05:32.090 --> 01:05:33.750
Don't make me tell you again.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.160
I quit.
For singing.

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:09.650
It's a tuxedo.

01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:16.400
For what I owe you from
the card game the other night.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.700
This rag?

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:23.500
It's fine Italian tailoring, dumb ass.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:24.970
- Italian?
- Yes.

01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:29.140
Is this your old tux?

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.680
Try it on.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.950
Well, if you've got no money
to pay me...

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.580
Forget it.

01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:40.850
- I'm joking, man.
- You ungrateful brat...

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:45.690
How do I look?

01:06:45.690 --> 01:06:47.090
It's perfect.

01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:48.800
It's a perfect fit.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.060
As if it was made to my measures.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.960
Try moving your arms around.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.100
What's the matter?

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.770
Nothing.

01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:01.170
Ow!

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:09.480
Did you have a fight?

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.250
I said it's nothing.

01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:15.850
This fits really well. Cool.

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:46.040
Is this a regular house call?

01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:49.450
I'll cut to the chase.

01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:55.450
Please let Jang-ho go.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:04.370
You took a lot of trouble coming here.
Have a drink on me.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.470
Let me know if you want girls.

01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:14.340
If Jang-ho owes you money,

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:18.750
I'll pay it back.
In installments if that's okay.

01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:24.350
Did you say you work in Gimcheon?

01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:28.950
Country school teachers probably
can't afford to drink here.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.000
Drop by with your colleagues some time.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.260
Gimcheon has plenty of bars, too.

01:08:34.899 --> 01:08:38.359
Not that I ever go there.

01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:46.080
What it cost you to feed
and raise him,

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.140
I'll pay it all back.

01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:54.850
You're a funny man.

01:08:57.090 --> 01:09:01.550
How come I only had assholes
for my teachers?

01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:12.960
Enough of this now.

01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:19.439
Does this look like
an orphanage to you?

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:24.540
Get out of here
while I ask you nicely.

01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:31.850
You're making a big mistake.

01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:36.450
Jang-ho shouldn't be wasting...

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:42.870
He shouldn't be working here.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.870
Didn't you hear what I said?

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.950
I need to be able to play
the piano for living.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.890
So, I'll need my hands.

01:09:58.890 --> 01:10:02.550
But you can take one of my feet,
if you have to.

01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:10.060
Please... Let him go.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.260
I beg you.

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.990
Chang-su!

01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:37.750
Don't touch me.

01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:41.550
Hey! I'm not done here.

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:53.770
Mr. Na,

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.040
did you have a fight?

01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:58.740
Did you do your practice?

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:01.040
What happened to your hand?

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.580
A grownup going around
having a fight?

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:09.750
Shut up.
Start with the vocal exercise.

01:11:10.090 --> 01:11:14.860
They'll say I'm a bad influence.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.200
Yes, boss.
I'll call you right back...

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.860
Turn off the damn phone!

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.900
Do you like living like that?

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.610
Student by day,
gangbanger by night.

01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:30.630
Do you like living a joke of a life?

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:33.680
What's wrong with you, man?

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.280
Did you have a fight with Mrs. Na?

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.780
Which one shall I sing today?
I'm in tip top condition.

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:43.490
People don't avoid you thugs
because they're scared.

01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:46.050
They avoid you because
you're stinking filthy scumbags.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.760
Come on, man.
What's gotten into you?

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:56.760
Ask anybody.
Ask what they think of you people?

01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:58.770
You extorting, pathetic

01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:01.330
low-lives!

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:05.580
You don't know
what you're talking about.

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:09.950
Nobody cared how I lived.

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:14.150
Did the school care? Teachers?
Hell no.

01:12:14.590 --> 01:12:19.290
The only ones that cared
were my family. My brothers!

01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:21.660
Chang-su is more than
a real brother to me.

01:12:22.090 --> 01:12:26.300
If you're serious about singing,
you gotta clean up first.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:30.000
Even if you sing in your fancy tux
and win awards,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.310
all people will see is a thug.

01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:36.040
Why would you care?

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.780
As long as I get you the damn trophy.

01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:41.480
What?

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:44.450
Isn't that why you took me in
in the first place?

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.250
'Get me the trophy?'

01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:49.760
'Get me the trophy?'

01:12:50.690 --> 01:12:55.390
You fucking asshole!
I treated you like a human being

01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:58.500
and you think you're all that?

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:03.500
Even if you get that trophy,
what good will it be?

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.770
You gotta be a man before anything.

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:12.180
Fine. I quit.

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:13.540
You fucking bastard!

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.250
I'm done.
I'm outta here.

01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:26.850
I don't owe you shit.

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:37.270
Go to hell!

01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:43.080
Keep on with the good work.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.440
Thank you, boss.

01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:53.490
- About the Dong-seong district...
- Yes, sir.

01:13:53.490 --> 01:13:55.050
There seems to be a lot of noise.

01:13:55.990 --> 01:14:01.150
Until either we or
Suseong clan moves out...

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:05.360
Why should that be us?

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:08.160
Take care of the problem.
Take Jang-ho with you.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.470
Yes, sir.

01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.570
Good.

01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:18.040
Enjoy your evening, boss.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.460
Is it good?

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:44.970
It's just a burger.

01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:48.630
Lift your chin up.

01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:57.750
Jang-ho

01:14:59.490 --> 01:15:03.250
Who looks like the biggest
sorry ass here?

01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:10.060
It's me.

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:14.360
What are you blathering about?

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:16.870
I've got no dream.

01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:20.570
What I want to do
in a year's time...

01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:25.240
Forget a year, I don't know
what I want to do tomorrow.

01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:30.240
If I had a talent like yours,
I wouldn't be living like that.

01:15:37.190 --> 01:15:38.450
Kid,

01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:42.550
take the school seriously.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.560
Listen to your teachers.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:51.270
I'll kill you if you get
kicked out again.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.840
I'm done with school.
I'm gonna concentrate on work.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.550
Wearing a school uniform
didn't make me a student.

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:07.340
Your pretty ass looks best in uniform.

01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:11.250
Who are you calling a pretty boy?

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:19.660
Jang-ho,

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.470
your teacher came by
to see the big boss.

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.840
He said that you need to
continue studying.

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:40.350
He offered to give up his foot
in exchange

01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:45.450
for letting you leave the family.

01:16:47.190 --> 01:16:51.760
Don't come to the club for a while.
Focus on the studies, alright?

01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.360
Boss.

01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:04.780
Are we all here?

01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:06.040
Yes, sir!

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:09.950
- Shall I call Jang-ho?
- Don't worry about it.

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:15.650
Let's get the job done
and go for a drink, okay?

01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:17.850
Yes, sir!

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:45.840
Let's go.

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.970
Boss!

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.250
Hold tight.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.050
Are you okay, boss?

01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:53.350
Hang on.

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:07.770
You son of a bitches!

01:19:28.090 --> 01:19:29.050
This way, boss.

01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:34.250
Take Chang-su and
get the hell out of here.

01:19:34.690 --> 01:19:36.060
Get the car.

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:46.270
You alright, bro?

01:19:47.410 --> 01:19:49.430
Hang in there, man. Okay?

01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:50.940
Boss!

01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:53.440
Will you stop making a fuss?

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.850
I've been hit before.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.250
Give me a cigarette.

01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:06.650
Bro,

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.360
you must be feeling alright
talking and laughing and all.

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:16.200
I thought you quit smoking.

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:19.000
You little lying prick.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.340
Does that really matter now?
Stop talking, man.

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.380
Look where you're going, dumb ass.

01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:26.940
Alright. Alright!

01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:30.580
Let's get you a few pretty stitches

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:33.550
and go for a burger.
What do you say?

01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:36.590
Fuck...I

01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:40.460
Forget burger. Let's go for a drink
just the two of us.

01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:53.270
Remember what I said to you?

01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:03.350
Live your life.

01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:09.350
Don't waste it like I did.
Alright...?

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:18.760
Bro!

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:20.860
Bro!

01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:23.160
Bro!

01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:06.750
Man...
the things you'll make me do.

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:14.150
I never went out and bought soup
even when my wife was sick.

01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:17.090
Who asked you to?

01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:18.850
Shut up.

01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:23.460
Have some soup.

01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:37.640
Before it gets cold.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:43.540
Even a little bit.

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.150
Come on.

01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:08.540
Mr. Na,

01:23:09.170 --> 01:23:10.140
Yeah?

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:16.640
Do you think I have a shot?

01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:25.650
Even a thug like me.

01:23:27.490 --> 01:23:31.260
If I do this singing right,

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.060
do you think
I can have a decent life?

01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:50.240
Listen to me carefully, Jang-ho.

01:23:53.590 --> 01:24:01.360
Do you remember the first time
I heard you sing?

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:10.270
Do you know why left the room
without a word after I heard you?

01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:16.840
I felt envious.

01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:24.540
I felt so envious that I could die.

01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:34.150
Your voice,

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:38.660
it's a god-given gift.

01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:44.670
I could never be half as
good as you if I tried.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.470
I can tell you with all confidence,

01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:52.540
you'll be a world-class tenor.

01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:58.450
Are you sure?

01:25:05.290 --> 01:25:06.660
Jang-ho,

01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:13.970
take off your gangster suit

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.870
and put on the tux.

01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:24.240
That's your destiny.

01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:30.150
This is the first time

01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:36.750
that anybody said anything
like that to me.

01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:39.550
No one

01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:43.460
ever said anything like that
to me before.

01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:07.350
Thanks, Jang-ho.

01:26:08.690 --> 01:26:09.950
I'm sorry.

01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:16.460
And thank you.

01:26:27.210 --> 01:26:28.940
Have you lost your mind?

01:26:29.770 --> 01:26:33.880
After all that I did for you...

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.280
You want to walk out on me?

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.840
You ungrateful son of a bitch!

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:59.170
What are you gonna do with that?
Stab me?

01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:01.160
No, sir.

01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:04.840
I'd rather die here.

01:27:13.690 --> 01:27:16.050
Is singing more precious
that your life?

01:27:19.290 --> 01:27:20.450
Yes, sir.

01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:30.170
I won't hold it against you
if you killed me right here and now.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.240
But if you tell me to stay here
and continue living this life,

01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:40.940
then I think I will despise you.

01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:44.140
What?

01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:51.650
You want me to kill you?

01:27:52.190 --> 01:27:56.360
If that's what you want.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:01.400
Where do you want to be buried?

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.660
Answer me!

01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:16.140
Fuck you.

01:28:29.690 --> 01:28:30.860
Go.

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:43.230
If you fail to make something
of yourself in 10 years,

01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:50.640
then I'll have your head
and the foot

01:28:55.890 --> 01:28:57.750
of that teacher of yours.

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:08.160
It's not me
that's letting you walk.

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:14.530
You owe it to Chang-su.

01:29:36.290 --> 01:29:39.360
I can't remember the last time
we were in the main competition.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.100
Good morning, sir.

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.260
Morning.

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:46.470
Mr. Na, you have really hit it big.

01:29:46.810 --> 01:29:49.170
- Are you getting any feelings?
- For what?

01:29:49.170 --> 01:29:50.340
The grand prize.

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.640
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:55.580
Hey, you two!

01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:57.080
I'm talking to you, lovebirds.

01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.050
Yes, sir.

01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:02.990
We should all be there, too.

01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:06.890
It's not like we have
nothing better to do...

01:30:06.890 --> 01:30:08.190
Are you referring to me?

01:30:08.190 --> 01:30:11.900
Of course not, sir.

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:14.760
Of course, we should all be there.

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.800
Off you go again.

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:19.500
Yes, Go... on your way.

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:20.870
How can he catch me
every single time?

01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:24.330
Why are they going
in opposite directions?

01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:27.940
Don't worry.
They'll meet around the back.

01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:31.350
She's too good for him.

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.050
You think so?

01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:36.390
Draw a deep breath.

01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:39.050
And start.

01:30:54.970 --> 01:30:57.880
I think I figured out
how to hit high C.

01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.140
Do you want to hear it again?

01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:01.140
That's okay.

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:05.250
From now on, don't sing
unless you're paid.

01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:08.690
It's not a sound that
just anybody can make.

01:31:08.690 --> 01:31:11.590
Nor is it something
you can hear anywhere.

01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:14.290
You and I are so much alike.

01:31:14.290 --> 01:31:17.400
We like the same food
and have the same hobby.

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.560
Isn't that right?

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.000
What's your hobby?

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.060
Go-stop card game.

01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:24.500
Paper, rock, scissors!

01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:26.970
Alright!

01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:30.230
Here I go.

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:33.880
Ow, owl

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:37.040
You had two bowls of rice,
didn't you?

01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:41.140
Go and nail it.

01:31:42.190 --> 01:31:43.350
The competition.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.560
Lee Jang-ho's own vincere?

01:31:58.400 --> 01:31:59.960
When you find that,

01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:04.630
that'll be your true victory.

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:06.180
Yes, sir.

01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:07.440
Yo, vincere!

01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:12.340
You should never use
your fist again. Alright?

01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:19.860
I'll bet everything I've got on that
you'll make a living with your voice.

01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:22.390
How much is that?

01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:25.160
Don't go into details, dumb ass.

01:32:33.710 --> 01:32:36.830
That wasn't bad.
Let's try that one more time.

01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:38.340
Ready?

01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:41.440
Mr. Na,

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:43.740
I need to go.

01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:46.450
Wait.

01:32:47.190 --> 01:32:49.550
Out of the way!

01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:59.100
Phew...

01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:01.070
Splash! Ew!

01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:07.370
That was close.

01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:10.840
Is that you, Jang-ho?

01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:13.340
Who's that?

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:16.440
It's your principal, that's who.

01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:19.840
Hello, sir.

01:33:20.690 --> 01:33:22.550
Tomorrow's the big day?

01:33:23.190 --> 01:33:25.090
Yes, sir.

01:33:25.090 --> 01:33:29.860
Give it your best shot
like you're doing now.

01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:33.300
Yes, sir.

01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:35.160
Take what Mr. Na says
into your heart.

01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:37.300
I am, sir.

01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:38.670
Harder than you're doing now.

01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:40.870
Yes, sir.

01:33:43.170 --> 01:33:46.440
He's a genius.

01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:48.440
Really?

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:52.650
He won the Sejong Competition
when he was younger

01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:57.040
and won a scholarship
to study in Italy.

01:33:58.290 --> 01:34:01.450
He even landed primo uomo
in a Puccini production.

01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:07.050
No way!

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:11.360
If he didn't suffer from
vocal cord tumor,

01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:15.940
<i>he would've had</i>
<i>an incredible career.</i>

01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:20.340
<i>The song he was going to sing</i>
<i>at his grand debut was</i>

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:24.940
<i>'Nessun Dorma.'</i>

01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:29.550
That's why you're his dream.

01:34:30.990 --> 01:34:32.550
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:35.760
Yes, sir.

01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:41.860
- Jang-ho...
- Sir?

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.260
Thanks for being here.

01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:48.170
Do you have some toilet paper
in your cubicle?

01:34:48.170 --> 01:34:50.540
I may have been here too long.

01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:54.640
Will you pass it to me?
Over or under?

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.780
Perhaps under the partition...

01:34:56.780 --> 01:35:00.450
Ow! Damn you, boy!

01:35:06.490 --> 01:35:07.750
Yes, Mr. Na.

01:35:08.290 --> 01:35:11.260
Tuxedo?
I'm in my school uniform.

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:22.030
Just kidding!
I'll be there on time.

01:35:22.570 --> 01:35:23.730
Where is the bouquet?

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:28.140
- Here.
- Why did you leave it on the floor?

01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:33.850
- God, I am so nervous.
- What are you, his wife?

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:55.540
Where do you think you're going?

01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:08.490
After tearing my club down to pieces

01:36:08.490 --> 01:36:10.150
you've given up fighting?

01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:12.250
What's this?

01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:16.860
Are you planning to debut
as a country singer?

01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:23.660
Teacher?

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:27.510
You go to school?

01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:29.870
What's a thug gonna do
with an education?

01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:31.430
I'll educate you with my foot!

01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:45.850
Come on, pick up the phone...

01:36:46.290 --> 01:36:47.450
Son of a bitch!

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.440
No one so far has been
as good as Jang-ho.

01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:04.080
Of course not.

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:06.040
You talk as if you're his mother.

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:10.850
When is he going to be on?

01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:16.650
<i>The person you're calling</i>
<i>is not available...</i>

01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:27.800
Will you please let me go?

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:30.670
You're not using your fist anymore?

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.830
Let's see how long you'll hold out.

01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:44.780
I really gotta be somewhere, okay?

01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:46.940
Will you let me go,
for fuck's sake!?

01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:11.930
What in God's name...?

01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:14.840
How could you do this to me?

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:19.850
Nah, you got it wrong.
I wasn't fighting.

01:38:26.490 --> 01:38:29.050
I didn't throw a punch.

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:34.650
I got beat up pretty bad.

01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:40.070
But I kept my belly covered

01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:43.130
so that I could sing.

01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.640
It's over, isn't it?

01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:57.250
What am I gonna do?

01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:11.160
There'll be
the final deliberation shortly.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.840
Excuse me!
Sir, madam...

01:39:15.670 --> 01:39:21.480
My student arrived a little late
because something happened.

01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:23.780
Can he please have his go?

01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:26.080
Deliberation is almost over.

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:27.490
- I understand...
- Better luck next time.

01:39:27.490 --> 01:39:30.290
But he worked really hard
for this competition.

01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:30.690
If you could
just take a few minutes...

01:39:30.690 --> 01:39:32.160
Security!

01:39:32.890 --> 01:39:35.590
Please come with us.

01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:36.890
- Just a minute.
- Come on.

01:39:36.890 --> 01:39:41.500
He put so much work
into preparing for today.

01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:44.500
I know I shouldn't do this
but please give him a chance.

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:45.800
Let's go.

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:48.170
- Just one chance, please.
- Come with us.

01:39:48.170 --> 01:39:51.280
Let me talk to the judges
for a second.

01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:51.980
Please, I'm begging you.

01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:55.240
What is he, a thug?

01:39:55.980 --> 01:39:58.780
- Please!
- Come with us, sir.

01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:01.290
I said let me go, damn it!

01:40:01.290 --> 01:40:05.050
All I'm asking is
5 minutes of your time.

01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:07.990
- You see...
- Get him out of here.

01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:11.000
It's not about the award.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.500
- Just give him a chance.
- Come on.

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:18.800
All he wants is a chance
to sing on this stage.

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:23.040
Damn you, people!

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:26.340
It's not about the award.

01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:29.380
All he wants is a chance
to sing on this stage.

01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:32.180
All you've got to do
is hear him sing.

01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:34.990
You can keep the damn trophies
to yourselves.

01:40:34.990 --> 01:40:37.450
What he wants is
the chance to sing here.

01:40:37.790 --> 01:40:40.350
- Please give him a chance.
- That's enough.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.160
Jang-ho!

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:28.340
Did you bring the noodles?

01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:40.160
Since you came all the way out here,
I'll give you 3 extra.

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:49.670
Take them.

01:45:54.510 --> 01:45:57.440
Come back in an hour
for the bowls.

01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:07.140
You alright?

01:46:09.190 --> 01:46:11.190
I can take a punch.

01:46:11.190 --> 01:46:13.950
I'm not talking about your body.
The competition, idiot!

01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:18.660
Regulation is a regulation.
I got there late.

01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:20.660
Still,

01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:24.160
the douche bags that won anything
won't be smiling

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.770
when they know
who the real winner is.

01:46:28.770 --> 01:46:30.170
Retard!

01:46:30.170 --> 01:46:32.980
That's why you're the way you are.

01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:36.680
Look at the rag you made
out of this fine tux.

01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:38.050
Relax.

01:46:39.380 --> 01:46:46.350
I'll be wearing it to school
instead of the uniform.

01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:28.460
<i>Pronto.</i>

01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:31.360
<i>Pronto?</i>

01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:35.530
Hey! It's me, Sang-jin.

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:43.180
<i>What got you to call me?</i>

01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:47.140
I wanted to apologize for
the last time.

01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:49.050
<i>The reunion?</i>

01:47:50.490 --> 01:47:52.290
<i>What have you got to apologize for?</i>

01:47:52.290 --> 01:47:58.160
I have a favor for you.
There is this kid...

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:01.800
Man,

01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:06.000
I don't get you.
It's an opportunity to kill for.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.700
I've never been on a plane.

01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:10.330
Then, take the damn boat.

01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:12.440
I get seasick.

01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:14.240
Damn you!

01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:16.450
Stop throwing things at me.

01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:19.380
I got the paperwork ready.
End of discussion.

01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:21.940
I said I'm not going.

01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:25.250
Go swim in the big water,
you shortsighted prick!

01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:37.860
But there is nobody there.

01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:39.670
In Italy, I mean.

01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:48.040
Nobody to drive me to school

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:52.150
or smack me in the head

01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:55.050
and nag at me endlessly.

01:48:56.490 --> 01:48:58.650
I'll be all on my own.

01:49:04.490 --> 01:49:05.500
You dumb piece of shit!

01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:08.660
You won't do that one little thing
to make me happy?

01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:11.800
You won't let me have the pleasure

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:16.430
of telling the world that I made
a world-class tenor out of my protégé?

01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:23.840
Mr. Na,

01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:25.050
What?

01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:27.150
do you think I can make it?

01:49:28.190 --> 01:49:30.250
There'll be gifted singers
from all over the world.

01:49:31.590 --> 01:49:33.750
Jang-ho,

01:49:35.190 --> 01:49:36.890
didn't I tell you

01:49:36.890 --> 01:49:40.160
that I can put all
my money on you?

01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:51.740
Let's sing a song together
before you go.

01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:57.340
Will this be the last lesson?

01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:01.050
School's out.

01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:21.770
<i>If I'm on the way tough and far</i>

01:50:21.770 --> 01:50:27.340
<i>I'd like to go with you</i>

01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:34.480
<i>If the morning sun rises</i>
<i>in our way</i>

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:39.750
<i>I'd like to tell you I'm happy</i>

01:50:40.890 --> 01:50:47.200
<i>I've looked around enough to know</i>

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:52.070
<i>It's with you that I am happy</i>

01:50:53.700 --> 01:50:58.230
I'm not the kind of girl

01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:00.640
that gets in the way of a man.

01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:03.040
I'll be sending you
on your way happily.

01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:05.740
Really?

01:51:08.090 --> 01:51:09.250
Cool.

01:51:09.690 --> 01:51:10.650
Thanks.

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:22.500
Can I wait for you?

01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:23.560
Don't.

01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:25.560
Why not?

01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:30.140
I gotta do my military service
when I get back.

01:51:31.070 --> 01:51:32.540
I'll wait that out, too.

01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:36.440
Well,

01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:39.650
if you can't help it.

01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:44.650
Jang-ho
- What?

01:51:47.590 --> 01:51:50.360
What are you doing?

01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:52.760
From this moment,

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.360
you're mine.

01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:57.360
Got that?

01:52:04.270 --> 01:52:05.240
What are you doing here

01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:08.380
in a sacred ground of learning?

01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:09.380
- Shit.
- Run!

01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:11.580
Where are you headed? You basters!

01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:13.850
This is the school premise.

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:15.640
Come and help me with gardening.

01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:17.950
Give me a hand.

01:52:20.190 --> 01:52:21.660
Jang-ho,

01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:26.900
when you get on the plane,
you gotta sit in the front.

01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:29.900
That way, you get served first

01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:32.060
and you can take the best seat.

01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:34.270
Okay.

01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:39.340
And don't forget to
take off your shoes.

01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:43.080
You have to take off your shoes?

01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:44.340
You didn't know that?

01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:50.650
Man, how are you going to
survive in a foreign country?

01:52:50.890 --> 01:52:54.450
I was only kidding.
Did you think I wouldn't know that?

01:52:55.290 --> 01:52:59.000
If there is something you need,

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.200
don't think about calling me.

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:02.670
I want you to figure it out
on your own.

01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:04.800
I'll call Mrs. Na.

01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:07.170
Enough now.
Get out of my sight.

01:53:08.970 --> 01:53:10.130
Sure.

01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:35.860
Go on.

01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:16.960
It never ends!

01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:18.970
Damn you!

01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:27.340
<i>7 years later</i>

01:55:35.190 --> 01:55:37.950
I have a good eye for talent.

01:55:39.090 --> 01:55:40.560
Just not the patience.

01:55:41.090 --> 01:55:45.260
Why couldn't I wait it out?

01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:48.060
Maybe I'll give it another go.

01:55:49.700 --> 01:55:51.260
Encore!

01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:53.170
My heart...

01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:56.770
Are you okay, sir?
Shall I call 114?

01:55:56.770 --> 01:55:58.980
It's 911, idiot!

01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:01.140
Just be quiet for a second.

01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:05.550
It's really pulling at
my heartstrings.

01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:09.350
Watching him perform on stage
after all these years.

01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:12.050
Bravo, Lee Jang-ho!

01:56:15.290 --> 01:56:19.100
Why did you bring a bouquet?

01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:23.060
It's much more sophisticated
to throw a single rose.

01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:26.600
Jang-ho like things in bulk.

01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:28.070
Shush!

01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:30.630
Quiet. It's the curtain call.

01:56:57.300 --> 01:57:00.760
A competition was held here
a long time ago.

01:57:01.970 --> 01:57:05.740
And there was a man
who created a scene

01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:09.840
throwing a tantrum

01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:11.740
trying to give his protégé
a chance to sing.

01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:18.450
I wouldn't be standing here tonight

01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:26.160
if it wasn't for that crazy man.
My music teacher.

01:57:36.570 --> 01:57:38.040
Lastly,

01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:41.540
I would like to sing
my favorite song.

01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:14.240
<i>If I'm on the way tough and far</i>

01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:19.740
