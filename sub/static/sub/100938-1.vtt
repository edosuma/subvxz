00:29.860 --> 00:34.500
Edmund Smuts did not
rest in peace.

00:37.020 --> 00:39.620
He lay down in the dirt

00:40.220 --> 00:42.580
But he did not sleep.

00:44.460 --> 00:46.220
The sleep of the innocent

00:46.300 --> 00:50.380
is not conferred upon a
soul so blackened

00:51.620 --> 00:52.900
So depraved,

00:53.740 --> 00:56.180
so cursed.

01:01.300 --> 01:02.740
He walks still

01:03.420 --> 01:05.180
between heaven

01:05.260 --> 01:07.300
and his awaiting hell.

01:24.580 --> 01:27.698
So wrote my ancestor
Gladestone Michaels

01:27.700 --> 01:30.860
in his journal in 1830.

01:31.140 --> 01:34.180
I come from a long line
of storytellers,

01:34.340 --> 01:36.100
it's in my blood

01:37.300 --> 01:40.580
and this story started
200 years ago

01:40.860 --> 01:43.820
When Gladestone, travelling
to Van Dieman's Land

01:43.980 --> 01:47.900
in search of adventure and
a story to write about found,

01:48.380 --> 01:51.740
in his words, a devil.

01:57.820 --> 02:02.740
Now, what he didn't write was
that he shot and killed Edmund,

02:02.900 --> 02:04.860
shot and killed him at a
church altar

02:04.900 --> 02:07.900
and married the woman he
was about to wed.

02:08.539 --> 02:12.700
Edmund was rich but Gladestone
didn't take a penny.

02:13.580 --> 02:15.700
He had his beloved Beatrice.

02:17.580 --> 02:19.460
End of story?

02:20.180 --> 02:21.180
No.

02:21.620 --> 02:23.620
Gladestone continues...

02:24.220 --> 02:28.300
"I do not sleep. Ever.

02:28.900 --> 02:33.620
Madness has my scent.
He is coming for me.

02:33.820 --> 02:37.140
I think only one thought.

02:37.740 --> 02:42.458
I, too, am damned
to the hellfire.

02:42.460 --> 02:45.658
My only hope of salvation

02:45.660 --> 02:51.460
is a blood redemption at the
grave of Edmund Smuts.

02:52.420 --> 02:57.058
When the blood of Smuts flows
one last time

02:57.060 --> 03:00.420
the Angel of Reckoning
shall arrive.

03:00.860 --> 03:04.740
Only then will I be released
from this covenant.

03:06.540 --> 03:08.540
I must act.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.700
Yet I falter.

03:12.780 --> 03:15.140
I cannot do it.

03:16.300 --> 03:19.220
I am doomed to burn.

03:22.020 --> 03:25.340
Gladestone never returned
to the grave

03:26.100 --> 03:28.500
And this is where I come in.

03:28.700 --> 03:33.260
My ancestor started this story
with a nib and a notebook.

03:34.260 --> 03:40.420
I'm going to finish it with
my first feature film.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.778
Not now man,
put it away.

03:45.780 --> 03:47.498
Brian! Two minutes man.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.498
It's going to go right over us.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.260
We'll do it later.

03:49.340 --> 03:51.220
Can we figure out where our ride is first?

03:51.980 --> 03:52.980
Yeah. Come at me.

03:53.740 --> 03:55.020
Holy shit!

03:57.740 --> 03:58.740
Come on.

04:00.020 --> 04:01.740
Come on, bring it!

04:17.459 --> 04:19.100
Wow!

04:22.700 --> 04:24.178
Damn it, I keep
getting his voicemail.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.058
C'mon just do one
for the website, right.

04:26.060 --> 04:27.538
We'll do it later OK?

04:27.540 --> 04:30.258
Can I at least get us a
ride out of here?

04:30.260 --> 04:33.698
Hello and welcome to Blood
RedemptionTheMovie.com.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.700
My name is Kurt Michaels
and this is

04:35.740 --> 04:38.458
Minute One, Day One, Hour One

04:38.460 --> 04:41.498
Of production of our upcoming
indie horror flick

04:41.500 --> 04:42.898
Blood Redemption.

04:42.900 --> 04:46.258
Three weeks ago I've cashed
in my college fund

04:46.260 --> 04:47.259
and have bought two
tickets for myself

04:47.261 --> 04:49.338
...hang on... and Brian here

04:49.340 --> 04:52.378

place Sydney, Australia.

04:52.380 --> 04:56.380
To film the next big
indie horror flick.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.698
It's going to be a wild ride
so strap yourselves in.

04:58.700 --> 05:00.218
I'm coming. I gotta roll.

05:00.220 --> 05:01.578

05:11.300 --> 05:13.698
No dude, I‘d love to
watch actually. Can I try?

05:13.700 --> 05:14.340
Aaah…

05:14.460 --> 05:15.380
Do you mind if I take
the car for a spin

05:15.420 --> 05:16.420
while you're surfing?

05:16.540 --> 05:17.540
You got a license?

05:17.700 --> 05:19.538
C'mon. I'm a good driver.

05:19.540 --> 05:21.220
A good driver.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.340
I'm sure you're a lot
of things Kurt but…

05:23.380 --> 05:25.258
I'm terrified by this
left side of the road thing.

05:25.260 --> 05:26.259
I've freaked out like
three times.

05:26.261 --> 05:27.676
That's right, You guys
drive on the wrong side don't ya

05:27.700 --> 05:28.978
- The right side.
- The wrong side.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.298
- The right side.
- Right side of the road.

05:30.300 --> 05:31.980
The best surfing
beach in the world.

05:32.380 --> 05:35.418
No no, I've never seen an
Aussie surf in Bondi.

05:35.420 --> 05:37.938
What! Who surfs there?

05:37.940 --> 05:39.500
Tourists mate. Like yourself.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.178
But you can
surf there right?

05:41.180 --> 05:42.618
If you like waves probably not.

05:42.620 --> 05:45.258
I heard the dolphins
actually surf there with you

05:45.260 --> 05:46.260
at Bondi.

05:47.220 --> 05:48.860
yeah cool.

05:49.340 --> 05:50.818
You boys want to shoot a
kangaroo while you're down here?

05:50.820 --> 05:51.978
- No.
- No thanks.

05:51.980 --> 05:52.980
Why not?

05:53.420 --> 05:55.700
They're so cute.
Are you kidding?

05:55.940 --> 05:56.938
I'll eat it…

05:56.940 --> 05:57.940
Aren't I meant to be…

06:04.100 --> 06:05.858
I don't know, you could
make some different movies

06:05.860 --> 06:06.859
movies in this car,

06:06.861 --> 06:09.420
you just attach the camera

06:09.540 --> 06:10.420
right here…

06:10.460 --> 06:11.860
Shit I've taken
a wrong turn.

06:12.180 --> 06:13.316
- Now it's Backseat Boys.
- Oh yeah.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.540
Oh Brian.

06:14.620 --> 06:16.500
Oh my God. Don't stop.

06:19.540 --> 06:22.138
You guys planning to
shoot a whole bloody

06:22.140 --> 06:23.178
film on an iPhone?

06:23.180 --> 06:24.538
- No.
- No this is just

06:24.540 --> 06:25.618
Part One of the documentary.

06:25.620 --> 06:26.778
People want
something bigger.

06:26.780 --> 06:28.218
People want transmedia.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.418
Transmedia is what the
people are hungry for.

06:30.420 --> 06:31.858
They want to be
able to download

06:31.860 --> 06:33.338
what they want
when they want it.

06:33.340 --> 06:34.578
So that's what
we're going to give them.

06:34.580 --> 06:35.778
We're gonna give them what
they want when they want so

06:35.780 --> 06:37.858
they can watch the movie and
then they can watch us

06:37.860 --> 06:38.580
making the movie.

06:38.620 --> 06:40.138
Mate, I'm your guy.
That's what I do.

06:40.140 --> 06:42.418
I shoot real life, I chop
out the boring bits.

06:42.420 --> 06:43.178
I'm your man.

06:43.180 --> 06:44.178
You won't have to too
much chopping with

06:44.180 --> 06:45.180
this idiot around.

06:45.420 --> 06:46.420
yeah why's that?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.418
Nothing's boring
with Kurt

06:51.940 --> 06:53.618
Oh man I've
always loved horror eh,

06:53.620 --> 06:54.620
can't get enough of it.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.778
Yeah. Like Japanese horror

06:56.780 --> 06:58.018
And ghost stories and shit?

06:58.020 --> 06:59.498
But what about
French horror man?

06:59.500 --> 07:00.138
French horror?

07:00.140 --> 07:01.139
Yeah. That's where
it is now.

07:01.141 --> 07:03.098
What's that? Like chicks
with hairy vaginas?

07:03.100 --> 07:04.298
No it's like arthouse
gore dude.

07:04.300 --> 07:07.580
It's like they totally see
the beauty in death.

07:11.940 --> 07:14.220
Gladestone came this way.

07:14.620 --> 07:17.620
Following the rumours, the whispers.

07:19.020 --> 07:21.660
Looking for his big story.

07:26.020 --> 07:29.340
In the end he couldn't
even tell his story.

07:29.980 --> 07:36.860
All he was left with was a dark,
horrible, unspeakable secret.

07:38.020 --> 07:39.980
That he took to the grave.

07:42.020 --> 07:44.420
So you're the director?

07:44.540 --> 07:45.876
No, no, I'm
just the producer.

07:45.900 --> 07:46.900
I'm the director.

07:46.980 --> 07:49.538
Yeah right and you
wrote the screenplay?

07:49.540 --> 07:52.618
Pretty much. It's based on
a story of an ancestor of mine

07:52.620 --> 07:53.778
so I just adapted that.

07:53.780 --> 07:54.659
Yeah wait a minute.

07:54.661 --> 07:57.538
The next.. the next Blair Witch
is based on a story

07:57.540 --> 07:59.260
of something that happened
in your family.

07:59.340 --> 08:00.980
Pretty much, that's
exactly it, yeah.

08:01.020 --> 08:02.300
You're a sick puppy mate.

08:02.740 --> 08:03.780
Thank you.

08:03.860 --> 08:05.540
OK let's get this doco going.

08:05.660 --> 08:08.220
Alright um. Exit the car fellas.

08:13.220 --> 08:15.460
Australian soil. Feels good.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.499
It was just an injury.

08:22.501 --> 08:24.138
That's the only reason
I can't surf okay?

08:24.140 --> 08:27.180
Maybe … maybe if I
heal or something..

08:27.220 --> 08:29.698
What is was was a dolphin
that he thought was a shark.

08:29.700 --> 08:30.298
No it wasn't.

08:30.300 --> 08:31.298
Boys, boys!

08:31.300 --> 08:32.179
ooh!

08:32.181 --> 08:33.260
Hello…

08:34.860 --> 08:37.457
Is this stalking? Technically
we've got a camera...

08:37.460 --> 08:39.298
No, no. It's not stalking
if they want to be followed.

08:39.299 --> 08:39.659
Right?

08:39.660 --> 08:41.938
Erggh..
Want to be followed?

08:41.940 --> 08:43.217
Yeah, by the right guys.

08:43.220 --> 08:45.138
That might be the creep
- iest thing you've ever said.

08:45.140 --> 08:46.338
Go on. Go talk to them.

08:46.340 --> 08:48.058
You talk to them.
I'm not picking women up for you

08:48.060 --> 08:49.138
What are you talking about?

08:49.140 --> 08:50.099
We'll hang back.

08:50.101 --> 08:51.740
OK we're busted.

08:59.860 --> 09:02.338
Look he's still filming!

09:02.340 --> 09:04.578
What is with you
and your cameras!?

09:04.580 --> 09:06.818
I mean I'm sorry for
going off at you before.

09:06.820 --> 09:07.578
No no it's alright.

09:07.580 --> 09:08.458
It's just weird.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.219
It's weird!

09:09.221 --> 09:10.858
Yeah I'm sorry about
the camera, that was Brian's idea.

09:10.860 --> 09:12.258
Oh thank you Brian

09:12.260 --> 09:13.778
Oh, no no no.

09:13.780 --> 09:14.978
Don't listen to him,
he's an idiot. He's an idiot.

09:14.980 --> 09:15.979
He has this thing
about dirty movies.

09:15.981 --> 09:17.698
He's been picked up on it
before as well.

09:17.700 --> 09:18.700
You're sick.

09:19.980 --> 09:21.018
Douche!

09:21.020 --> 09:23.218
So what kind of movies
you guys been making?

09:23.220 --> 09:24.218
Porn, mostly.

09:24.220 --> 09:25.218
Gay porn.

09:25.220 --> 09:26.220
Gay porn.

09:26.860 --> 09:27.859
It is actually

09:27.861 --> 09:29.578
First time in Australia.
First day in Australia.

09:29.580 --> 09:30.500

10:07.060 --> 10:08.978

Excellent!

10:10.580 --> 10:12.876

- Yeah we gotta go.

10:12.900 --> 10:14.738

Yeah, absolutely.

Guys, it was so good to meet
you though

10:16.220 --> 10:17.860

10:18.140 --> 10:19.898
I mean, thank you for
being our tour guides

10:19.900 --> 10:21.818
What? Is everything OK?

10:21.820 --> 10:23.698
We've wasted a bit
of time here today so…

10:23.700 --> 10:25.458
He's … he's a
kooky dude.

10:25.460 --> 10:27.420
I don't know, he has some…

10:27.500 --> 10:28.698
Was it something I said?

10:28.700 --> 10:31.058
No no no no.
Never that, don't worry.

10:31.060 --> 10:33.498
I'll get your contacts,

10:33.500 --> 10:36.980
Get everything organised

10:55.380 --> 10:57.860
We're running out
of time. Kurt.

11:02.060 --> 11:03.060
Shae will do it.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.380
You don't...

11:05.020 --> 11:06.338
You don't know that.
We haven't seen her,

11:06.340 --> 11:07.978
she hasn't talked to us,
her agent hasn't..

11:07.980 --> 11:09.460
I'm nervous, man.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.540
This is a big gamble.

11:11.700 --> 11:12.379
On this one girl.

11:12.381 --> 11:14.618
That was a great opportunity.

11:14.620 --> 11:16.020
Yeah.

11:19.980 --> 11:20.978
I know, I know.

11:20.980 --> 11:21.979
Shae will do it.

11:21.981 --> 11:23.981
I trust you,
it'll be fine. Yeh I know but…

11:24.020 --> 11:26.418
just let me have a
safety net. Can I?

11:26.420 --> 11:27.418
- OK... OK.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.419
But Shae will do it.

11:28.421 --> 11:31.258
Hey hey boys, sorry
to interrupt but who's Shae?

11:31.260 --> 11:33.898
Ah, he doesn't know,
why don't you tell him?

11:33.900 --> 11:36.540
OK, Shae is the stunning
female lead

11:36.620 --> 11:38.618
female lead to our film
Blood Redemption.

11:38.620 --> 11:41.460
Yeah right. But what,
she won't commit to the role or..

11:41.500 --> 11:43.178
Well it's tough for her to
commit when she doesn't

11:43.180 --> 11:44.740
know it exists.

11:45.740 --> 11:47.738
Her agent's blocking us,
he doesn't like the whole

11:47.740 --> 11:49.698
indie movie thing…

11:49.700 --> 11:52.300
Look at this view.
They give it to the dead!

11:52.940 --> 11:55.058
Kurt's had a hard-on for this
chick that just won't quit.

11:55.060 --> 11:57.258
- Fuck you.
- What, man? It's true.

11:57.260 --> 11:59.858
You wrote a screenplay for her.
You won't see anyone else.

11:59.860 --> 12:00.659
Woah look at this.

12:00.661 --> 12:03.061
- Kurt Michael's film.
- I call that obsessed.

12:03.820 --> 12:04.820
Died of...

12:05.900 --> 12:08.618
doubt and despair after
lingering illness.

12:08.620 --> 12:09.818
- So sad.
- If we don't have an

12:09.820 --> 12:11.620
actress we don't have a film.

12:12.700 --> 12:13.700
Shae will do it.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.580
I hope so

12:16.660 --> 12:17.660
Shae will do it.

12:30.340 --> 12:33.298
This is the Journal.

12:33.300 --> 12:34.940
The famous Journal.

12:35.820 --> 12:36.819
Holy shit.

12:36.821 --> 12:39.460
Show me. Yeah.
My favourite's the next one.

12:39.540 --> 12:40.299
Turn the page.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.140
- What?
- Look at the next one.

12:42.900 --> 12:44.298
Dude, this shit is
messed up.

12:44.300 --> 12:46.018
That's the genocide man.

12:46.020 --> 12:47.698
Wait. Where's this set?

12:47.700 --> 12:49.058
Tasmania.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.500
Yeah right.

12:50.980 --> 12:52.980
And you're going to Tasmania?

12:53.060 --> 12:54.860
We're going to Tasmania.

12:55.620 --> 12:58.980
Package deal.
I'm not so sure...

12:59.300 --> 13:02.580
what this stuff means but it
came with the Journal so…

13:03.700 --> 13:06.578
You're a weird guy Kurt.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.218
How the hell did you
get this through Customs?

13:08.220 --> 13:10.140
There's some ashes
in here. I know, right?

13:10.260 --> 13:11.460
I have my ways.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.420
There you are mate.

13:13.540 --> 13:15.420
You can keep your weird
shit to yourself.

13:16.660 --> 13:17.658
It's cool right?

13:17.660 --> 13:18.660
Mm-hmm.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.018
Just don't know what
any of it's used for.

13:21.020 --> 13:21.739
Yep.

13:21.741 --> 13:22.978
How does it help?

13:22.980 --> 13:24.780
This looks like a
tongue scraper to me.

13:27.860 --> 13:30.180
Did your parents tell
you about this Gladestone guy?

13:34.100 --> 13:35.500
Kurt's an orphan.

13:36.020 --> 13:37.898
Shit! Sorry mate
I didn't mean to..

13:37.900 --> 13:39.940
No, no, don't.. don't flip
out man, it's cool.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.180
It's part of life's rich
tapestry you know.

13:43.180 --> 13:44.180
Sorry.

13:46.380 --> 13:48.258
Besides, my family's
basically adopted him

13:48.260 --> 13:49.259
by now anyway.

13:49.261 --> 13:51.220
So you fellas are
like brothers then?

13:51.580 --> 13:53.300
He's basically Dad's
favourite kid.

13:54.220 --> 13:56.300
I reckon it's more your
mom that fancies me.

13:56.340 --> 13:58.778
Hey! Can we leave the
mothers out of this?

13:58.780 --> 13:59.978
You reckon I could
meet you mum mate?

13:59.980 --> 14:01.060
No. We're here on business.

14:01.420 --> 14:02.420
Alright? Business.

14:02.980 --> 14:03.820
Down here?

14:03.860 --> 14:04.498
This one?

14:04.500 --> 14:05.178
Yeah.

14:05.180 --> 14:05.780
Here?

14:05.860 --> 14:07.378
Yeah. Just lift
the latch.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.500
Really?

14:08.980 --> 14:09.980
Is there a light?

14:10.100 --> 14:12.860
Oh yeah. Be careful.
Just don't electrocute yourself.

14:13.260 --> 14:14.260
There we go.

14:14.540 --> 14:17.538
This is exactly how I
imagined my city production

14:17.540 --> 14:18.540
office, thank you.

14:19.060 --> 14:20.418
There's room to
sleep upstairs

14:20.420 --> 14:21.596
this will have to be the office.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.620
- Alright.
- Oh God

14:24.980 --> 14:26.418
Be careful mate,
we found a dead rat

14:26.420 --> 14:27.420
in there the other day.

14:29.260 --> 14:32.218
- I'm really serious.
- We get next doors Wifi

14:32.220 --> 14:33.900
Are there spiders in here?

14:34.540 --> 14:35.540
No.

14:35.820 --> 14:36.938
You sure?

14:36.940 --> 14:37.619
No.

14:37.621 --> 14:39.580
Next question...
where's your mom?

14:41.220 --> 14:42.458
Sorry but who's Shae?

14:42.460 --> 14:44.618
In the middle there.
Under the blood.

14:44.620 --> 14:45.619
The blonde.

14:45.621 --> 14:48.340
So… there's no bookings.

14:48.620 --> 14:49.778
whaddya mean,
what does that mean?

14:49.780 --> 14:51.500
It's just first come,
first serve.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.458
Go get some tickets.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.220
Doors aren't even open man,
it's alright.

14:57.140 --> 14:58.316
Chill man. It'll be OK.

14:58.340 --> 14:59.738
- Just chill.
- Don't tell me to chill

14:59.740 --> 15:01.940
Brian, alright? I'm chilled. Ok?

15:03.300 --> 15:04.740
Let's get some beer.

15:05.060 --> 15:07.500
Yeah. Grab me a Fosters?

15:08.620 --> 15:10.420
"Don't worry Kurt

15:10.460 --> 15:12.220
I'll do your little film.

15:12.380 --> 15:13.980
And then I'll do you".

15:19.140 --> 15:21.578
When shall we three meet again?

15:21.580 --> 15:24.300
In thunder, lightning or in rain?

15:24.460 --> 15:26.060
When the Hurly-burly's done,

15:26.340 --> 15:28.460
when the battle's lost and won.

15:28.700 --> 15:29.700
Where be the place?

15:29.980 --> 15:30.980
Upon the heath.

15:31.540 --> 15:33.140
There to meet with…

15:33.220 --> 15:34.980
Macbeth!

15:38.620 --> 15:42.658
All hail Macbeth,
thou shalt be king hereafter.

15:42.660 --> 15:45.938
Good Sir, why do
you start in fear for that

15:45.940 --> 15:48.820
which sounds so fair.

15:49.140 --> 15:49.899
Speak!

15:49.901 --> 15:51.180
No stay… fuck!

15:51.700 --> 15:53.380
Fuck! Stay

15:54.580 --> 15:56.380
A little later.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.258
They must lie there.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.818
Go carry them and smear the
sleepy grooms with blood.

16:03.820 --> 16:07.420
I'll go no more… I'm…

16:12.420 --> 16:14.378
Sorry,
this is a changeroom.

16:14.380 --> 16:16.378
- Shae..
- Hi.

16:16.380 --> 16:18.018
- Hi!
- You can't be in here,

16:18.020 --> 16:19.058
we just done a show.

16:19.060 --> 16:20.236
I'm Kurt, Kurt Michaels.

16:20.260 --> 16:22.820
Um, we met at Aaron Levy's
party in LA.

16:23.060 --> 16:24.380
Aaaah…

16:24.700 --> 16:26.218
- Aaron Levy.
- Aaron Levy's!

16:26.220 --> 16:28.738
Of course! So what are
you guys .. out from L.A.?

16:28.740 --> 16:30.938
Yes. We just…
We just came in. Actually.

16:30.940 --> 16:31.900
- Awesome.

16:31.940 --> 16:33.018
- From L.A.
- Cool.

16:33.020 --> 16:35.140
And I'm.. I'm..
Well I'm ready to do our film.

16:36.860 --> 16:37.860
Sorry?

16:38.980 --> 16:41.420
Um. OK so you remember
at the party how I told you

16:41.460 --> 16:44.898
that I was adapting an old
family story to a script.

16:44.900 --> 16:46.620
Well I finished the script and..

16:46.980 --> 16:48.978
And we've tried to contact
your agent a bunch of times

16:48.980 --> 16:50.618
Um babe. I'm gonna
go get a drink

16:50.620 --> 16:52.138
- and say hello to a few people so..
- .. we haven't heard back..

16:52.140 --> 16:53.498
I'll see you
in the foyer.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.499
But it's such a
good project

16:54.501 --> 16:55.858
and I think you would just...

16:55.860 --> 16:57.620
well I think it would
be great for you.

16:57.820 --> 16:59.458
Have you got
any other actors or anything?

16:59.460 --> 17:01.020
Oh you'd be
starring opposite me.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.660
really? You're an actor?

17:03.860 --> 17:04.539
Yeah remember?

17:04.540 --> 17:06.420
Actor slash director
slash writer.

17:06.460 --> 17:07.460
Right...

17:07.940 --> 17:08.940
That's a lot of slashes.

17:09.619 --> 17:11.498
Look guys, I am so flattered but

17:11.500 --> 17:12.538
I'm going to save you some time.

17:12.540 --> 17:13.539
I've done this kind of
stuff before and ..

17:13.540 --> 17:14.955
Just, just get coffee
with me. Right now.

17:14.980 --> 17:16.339
We'll go grab a coffee and

17:16.380 --> 17:17.818
I'm actually running
late to meet a friend

17:17.819 --> 17:19.338
I'll go through
it with you

17:19.339 --> 17:20.818
Aaa… Sorry…

17:20.819 --> 17:21.819
but I.. yeah.

17:21.820 --> 17:24.058
Tomorrow!
Let's do coffee tomorrow.

17:24.060 --> 17:25.178
- Umm.
- Or a drink?

17:25.180 --> 17:26.938
I'll buy you a glass of
wine and, and look,

17:26.940 --> 17:28.338
honestly, it's not just
for me, it's for you.

17:28.339 --> 17:31.500
Kurt, I'm actually very
flat out at the moment, my...

17:31.900 --> 17:32.858
- Five minutes!
- I, I really

17:32.860 --> 17:33.579
I really appreciate it.

17:33.581 --> 17:35.618
Alright four I'll settle for

17:35.620 --> 17:37.658
but three is out of
the question.

17:37.660 --> 17:40.780
Yeah. I.. I'm sorry...

17:41.140 --> 17:42.618
I can't really.

17:42.620 --> 17:43.619
Thank you though.

17:43.621 --> 17:45.940
Can we.. maybe call a cut?

17:52.180 --> 17:53.460
Don't worry about it bro.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.140
You'll get your film made.

17:56.980 --> 17:59.018
She couldn't even remember my name man.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.780
She forgot it twice.

18:32.900 --> 18:34.820
I reckon you've
dodged a bullet here.

18:37.980 --> 18:38.980
You know what I mean.

18:39.580 --> 18:40.379
I mean think about it.

18:40.381 --> 18:42.658
Think about how many actors
there are in the wings.

18:42.660 --> 18:45.900
I mean.. who are dying
to be in a film like this.

18:59.540 --> 19:00.820
I gotta story
to tell you.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.300
Awesome.

19:03.700 --> 19:05.060
Human ivory.

19:05.340 --> 19:05.940
What?

19:06.180 --> 19:08.778
Yeah, in the 1820's
there was an illegal trade

19:08.780 --> 19:11.178
in human relics like
carved skulls and...

19:11.180 --> 19:12.180
Careful...

19:12.460 --> 19:15.580
and aah, scrimshaw bones
and that kind of thing.

19:15.900 --> 19:18.098
Yeah, cool mate, but I
don't think that kind of shit

19:18.100 --> 19:19.978
really happened here,
you know what I mean.

19:19.980 --> 19:22.338
Here. Gladestone
knew that, right?

19:22.340 --> 19:25.060
OK but, but.. then he discovered
something really weird.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.658
He traced the human cargo
back to this European

19:28.660 --> 19:30.700
living in the backwoods of Tasmania.

19:30.980 --> 19:32.420
Edmund Smuts.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.260
Ah right... the freak.

19:36.660 --> 19:38.738
Yes, freak.. but it's not
what you think alright,

19:38.740 --> 19:41.660
he's not some mountain psycho
walking around in,

19:41.820 --> 19:44.298
in human skin panties full
of his own crap you know,

19:44.300 --> 19:46.538
he, he.. he was a mayor
of a local mining town.

19:46.540 --> 19:47.740
He owned everything.

19:48.460 --> 19:51.778
And this human flesh trade was
just a sideline hobby of his.

19:51.780 --> 19:53.820
Seriously fucked up mate.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.500
Right?

19:57.980 --> 19:58.980
So...

19:59.580 --> 20:04.020
Edmund ruled with this
bloodthirsty terror.

20:04.540 --> 20:07.900
Right. He would've had corpses
hanging from these trees.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.060
He just slaughtered people.

20:10.340 --> 20:13.740
That's seriously fucked
up but it's still not a movie.

20:13.940 --> 20:14.740
What's not a movie?

20:14.860 --> 20:15.860
The Journal.

20:15.900 --> 20:16.499
So...

20:16.501 --> 20:18.140
Did you tell him about
the Curse though?

20:18.340 --> 20:19.898
Wait a minute..
There's a curse?

20:19.900 --> 20:21.378
- Fucking..
- Ow!

20:21.380 --> 20:23.258
Spoiler alert man.
C'mon! Nice one!

20:23.260 --> 20:25.298
You didn't tell him?
That's the best part!

20:25.300 --> 20:26.300
No. Alright.

20:26.820 --> 20:28.180
Here, gimme that…

20:29.340 --> 20:30.340
Human bone.

20:31.180 --> 20:32.740
One of Edmund's victims.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.180
No this is Edmund.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.860
The uh, the locals as revenge
put a curse on him.

20:40.180 --> 20:41.700
To say that when he was buried

20:42.100 --> 20:43.900
a demon would be summoned.

20:44.420 --> 20:45.420
A demon.

20:46.100 --> 20:47.596
- Yeah.
- Yeah, good one.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.460
And Gladestone believed that?

20:49.740 --> 20:53.258
Aah, well all I know is that
somehow he thought that

20:53.260 --> 20:54.498
this would save him
from his own fate.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.100
It all had to be
buried together.

20:56.860 --> 20:58.858
He thought that this box
of shit would save his own arse.

20:58.860 --> 20:59.700
Oh yeah.

20:59.860 --> 21:00.779
You better believe it.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.660
That's right.
Blood Redemption...

21:03.380 --> 21:07.098
One man's attempt to atone
for the sins of the past.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.978
OK, I take it all back.
You guys have a film.

21:09.980 --> 21:12.578
But.. don't you think it's
a bit deep for horror?

21:12.580 --> 21:14.380
Oh it's alright.
We'll dumb it down.

21:14.860 --> 21:15.900
Speak for yourself.

21:25.060 --> 21:26.660
so what's so
good about this guy?

21:28.060 --> 21:29.618
Lots of th..
He's got a really good eye.

21:29.620 --> 21:30.620
Some of his stuff like..

21:30.980 --> 21:31.979
Freaked me out.

21:31.981 --> 21:33.538
What's he made,
movies or something?

21:33.540 --> 21:35.058
Yeah, yeah, he's
done everything.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.980
But he was an old
war photographer so..

21:37.060 --> 21:38.178
- He knows his stuff.
- Cool.

21:38.180 --> 21:39.179
Does he have
his own kit?

21:39.181 --> 21:40.261
- Yeah.
- OK.

21:40.860 --> 21:41.860
Just a sec mate.

21:44.620 --> 21:45.459
Uh, so..

21:45.461 --> 21:47.498
So Grant, I've seen
all your work,

21:47.500 --> 21:50.778
um.. those pictures you
took in the war were..

21:50.780 --> 21:54.418
The guy in Mistrata, with
the eyes full of despair I mean..

21:54.420 --> 21:56.020
We're shooting a horror
so it's all about

21:56.100 --> 21:57.820
suspense and fear.

21:58.260 --> 21:59.260
Got any kit?

22:00.540 --> 22:01.538
Nada.

22:01.540 --> 22:02.540
Budget for an assistant?

22:02.780 --> 22:03.780
Um…

22:05.260 --> 22:06.260
What about him?

22:06.700 --> 22:09.300
That's.. no he's
filming the doco so..

22:09.460 --> 22:11.220
He'll have
his hands full.

22:11.620 --> 22:13.076
In that case
it'll be you two then.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.180
I'll need extra batteries..

22:15.060 --> 22:16.180
You can fix me up for those.

22:16.980 --> 22:19.460
So, so .. shall we go
and look at the script?

22:20.580 --> 22:22.218
Nah, not interested mate.

22:22.220 --> 22:23.538
I know that shot you're
in love with.

22:23.540 --> 22:25.620
- That fella in Misrata right?
- Yeah.

22:27.140 --> 22:29.300
He died while I was
filming that, you know.

22:37.540 --> 22:39.740
C'mon Shae, just look,
read the script.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.380
It's that simple.

22:42.020 --> 22:43.020
Why not?

22:43.340 --> 22:45.898
Seriously Kurt, there are
like a thousand other girls

22:45.900 --> 22:46.898
that would jump to a film

22:46.900 --> 22:47.898
No I don't want anyone..

22:47.900 --> 22:48.900
I wrote it for you Shae.

22:49.060 --> 22:50.818
OK, you wanna be big right?

22:50.820 --> 22:51.818
You want what I want.

22:51.820 --> 22:52.818
You want success.

22:52.820 --> 22:53.819
Of course. Who doesn't?

22:53.821 --> 22:56.738
Yes exactly, everybody.
Everybody wants success.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.898
But you can't just, just knock
on the door and wait for it

22:58.900 --> 23:00.538
- to open, you gotta bash it down.
- I get it Kurt,

23:00.540 --> 23:01.618
I was in L.A. for 2 years.

23:01.620 --> 23:03.738
I've did it there, a cattle
call every other day.

23:03.740 --> 23:04.739
Fuck L.A. You don't need L.A.

23:04.741 --> 23:06.778
I got 2 ads and a walkon

23:06.780 --> 23:08.156
- in a pilot the whole time.
- You're, you're something

23:08.180 --> 23:10.060
special, you just need
to take a chance!

23:12.300 --> 23:13.938
It's different for you Kurt.

23:13.940 --> 23:17.658
You can knock until it opens
but I've got a clock on me

23:17.660 --> 23:18.858
and I can't ignore it so..

23:18.860 --> 23:19.859
Wait, so you just think
your looks are just going

23:19.861 --> 23:22.260
to fade out before you
get your big break, is that..?

23:22.580 --> 23:23.580
Yeah.

23:24.380 --> 23:26.738
I booked a ticket.
I'm going back to L.A.

23:26.740 --> 23:29.298
If I can't make it in
a year then that's that.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.780
- What?! No!

23:30.940 --> 23:32.058
- I just really not..

23:32.060 --> 23:33.059
You repeat offender.

23:33.061 --> 23:35.138
I'm really not in the
same place. I'm sorry Kurt

23:35.140 --> 23:37.178
Look Shae, every morning,
every morning I wake up

23:37.180 --> 23:40.338
and I feel like a fucking genius,
like an inevitable force

23:40.340 --> 23:42.298
and… in here I, I...

23:42.300 --> 23:43.299
Great.

23:43.301 --> 23:45.498
No, no it's not some hippy
affirmation bullshit,

23:45.500 --> 23:48.300
OK, this is the real deal and I want
you to feel that way as well.

23:48.500 --> 23:49.500
I really do.

23:49.900 --> 23:51.818
Ok, what about that, that,
that experience that your

23:51.820 --> 23:53.578
audience is craving huh?

23:53.580 --> 23:54.580
Is, is starving for?

23:55.300 --> 23:59.020
To, to, to kill your enemies
and fuck your lovers and

23:59.380 --> 24:01.700
agonize in your heartache huh?

24:01.860 --> 24:03.740
How are you going to deny them?

24:04.980 --> 24:06.738
You don't
understand at all.

24:06.740 --> 24:09.218
Shae, I think you can
give that to them. I do.

24:09.220 --> 24:11.860
Alright. But you're going to
run away and hide in L.A.

24:12.220 --> 24:12.739
C'mon!

24:12.741 --> 24:14.900
I wish that I could
live in that world

24:15.140 --> 24:16.140
that you just described.

24:17.700 --> 24:19.058
It doesn't happen like that.

24:19.060 --> 24:20.778
OK. I'm sorry. It's back to
work for me...

24:20.780 --> 24:21.980
C'mon Shae I'm serious.

24:22.140 --> 24:22.619
Please.

24:22.621 --> 24:24.618
Don't come back again.

24:24.620 --> 24:26.978
OK, you have my answer,
no means no.

24:26.980 --> 24:28.660
I..

24:35.460 --> 24:36.780
Aaah…

24:47.180 --> 24:48.220
c'mon, let's go.

24:54.060 --> 24:57.220
All right. I love our
job. I really do.

24:57.700 --> 24:58.698
- OK.
- OK.

24:58.700 --> 24:59.700
Number one!

25:00.620 --> 25:01.620
No.

25:03.780 --> 25:05.220
- Right away?
- Nope.

25:05.260 --> 25:05.859
OK

25:05.861 --> 25:06.938
She looks like
Nicolas Cage.

25:06.940 --> 25:08.018
Yeah. No, no,
alright, I gotcha.

25:08.020 --> 25:09.020
"Cagey".

25:10.380 --> 25:10.900
Yeah.

25:11.220 --> 25:12.460
- Two.
- Two.

25:12.620 --> 25:13.620
Nope.

25:14.700 --> 25:15.700
No

25:15.940 --> 25:17.580
I actually got to talk to
her on the phone

25:17.620 --> 25:19.100
and she seemed pretty nice.

25:20.100 --> 25:21.100
Just saying.

25:22.180 --> 25:22.900
Next.

25:23.020 --> 25:24.020
Right.

25:27.660 --> 25:28.660
No.

25:29.020 --> 25:31.498
This is Emma Stone.
She's not even auditioning.

25:31.500 --> 25:32.500
Can you pay attention?

25:33.660 --> 25:34.818
OK maybe.

25:34.820 --> 25:35.820
No.

25:36.060 --> 25:37.060
I don't know…

25:38.100 --> 25:40.020
No, she has.. she has
too many features.

25:40.260 --> 25:41.500
Oh OK, that's nice.

25:42.500 --> 25:42.860
No.

25:43.420 --> 25:44.420
What do you mean no?

25:45.420 --> 25:46.618
- I dunno.
- No..?

25:46.620 --> 25:47.660
She looks like you.

25:47.700 --> 25:48.700
Who's that?

25:48.900 --> 25:49.900
This one?

25:50.460 --> 25:51.460
No.

25:51.740 --> 25:53.618
You pointed her out.
Alright. No, no, no.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.298
Here we go. Here we go.
We have a winner.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.658
She looks like a goat.
One eyebrow.

25:57.660 --> 25:58.900
- OK.
- Next.

25:58.940 --> 26:00.218
You're annoyed
with Mifanwy

26:00.220 --> 26:02.220
No, I dated a Mifanwy,
remember, no!

26:02.620 --> 26:04.060
Why did you ever do that?

26:04.140 --> 26:06.058
That's re-treading
emotional territory.

26:06.060 --> 26:06.938
Oh calm down.

26:08.180 --> 26:09.180
Nope.

26:09.620 --> 26:11.100
Little older than you.

26:14.100 --> 26:15.100
Uh-uh.

26:15.660 --> 26:16.660
She's nice.

26:21.340 --> 26:22.340
Yeah.

26:22.500 --> 26:23.500
He's a great guy.

26:23.580 --> 26:25.260
We did a film together.

26:25.340 --> 26:26.738
Thanks again so much
again for coming down

26:26.740 --> 26:27.540
on such short notice.

26:27.580 --> 26:28.460
Thanks for having us.

26:28.500 --> 26:29.898
No I'm just glad we
could work this out.

26:29.900 --> 26:31.738
Yeah. Well it sounds
like a great project.

26:31.740 --> 26:34.258
Good. Yeah. And we've
got everything all sorted out,

26:34.260 --> 26:36.578
we have contracts in place,
all of our locations are

26:36.580 --> 26:39.418
all set up so we're ready
to go after today you know.

26:39.420 --> 26:40.419
- So just casting?
- Yeah!

26:40.421 --> 26:42.378
Yeah. Find a lead
actress and out the door.

26:42.380 --> 26:43.538
- Cool.
- Sweet.

26:43.540 --> 26:44.538
Yeah

26:44.540 --> 26:45.539
You must be excited.

26:45.541 --> 26:47.378
Oh yeah.
I'm ready to go.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.698
and um..
Kurt's got the audition piece.

26:50.700 --> 26:51.419
Oh cool.

26:51.421 --> 26:53.036
So we'll get you
set up with that and then..

26:53.060 --> 26:54.178
You know,
down to business.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.940
- Thank you
- You're welcome.

27:04.460 --> 27:06.340
So Kurt...
it's a slasher.

27:07.180 --> 27:10.458
Um, well.. it covers
the whole spectrum of horror.

27:10.460 --> 27:12.260
This isn't
actually the script.

27:13.940 --> 27:15.980
It's a piece for
the... the auditions.

27:20.380 --> 27:21.380
Bye Lauren.

27:22.380 --> 27:24.180
OK. Um..

27:24.740 --> 27:25.740
Everyone...

27:26.540 --> 27:27.820
Thanks for coming.

27:28.300 --> 27:29.500
Uh, Brian?

27:29.620 --> 27:31.098
You wanna? Come with me.

27:31.100 --> 27:32.100
Good morning all.

27:33.180 --> 27:35.138
Alien fetus…? Yep?

27:35.140 --> 27:36.140
Alien fetus.

27:38.780 --> 27:40.180
Oh God!

27:40.380 --> 27:41.980
I feel its heartbeat.

27:42.420 --> 27:43.420
My flesh.

27:43.580 --> 27:44.858
Ok, I'm going to stop
you right there.

27:44.860 --> 27:46.340
I just need it to be a bit bigger.

27:46.900 --> 27:47.779
Just a bit bigger.

27:47.781 --> 27:49.378
I mean this thing is trying
to give you a C-Section

27:49.380 --> 27:50.420
from the inside out right.

27:50.660 --> 27:53.060
Like aaaarrwwwk..
Raptor inside your belly kinda.

27:55.220 --> 27:56.220
Ooaah!!

27:56.580 --> 27:57.580
Eeee!

27:58.100 --> 27:59.100
Great.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.180
It consumes my nutrition.

28:02.420 --> 28:03.179
My flesh.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.218
- OK, you're pissed about
that. You need that nutrition.

28:05.220 --> 28:07.138
It consumes my nutrition!

28:07.140 --> 28:09.260
- That's YOUR nutrition.
- MY nutrition.

28:09.380 --> 28:11.220
My flesh. Oh God!

28:11.500 --> 28:12.498
- Up.

28:12.500 --> 28:13.500
Oh GOD!

28:13.940 --> 28:16.780
Oh God in heaven, free me
from this parasite.

28:17.300 --> 28:18.299
I can't go on.

28:18.301 --> 28:20.141
Can you make that
more of like a prayer?

28:20.660 --> 28:22.058
I see her as being
quite religious.

28:22.060 --> 28:23.180
You can choose the religion.

28:23.700 --> 28:24.460
OK.

28:24.620 --> 28:25.898
- OK, he likes you.
- OK.

28:25.900 --> 28:26.899
- Great.
- Yep.

28:26.901 --> 28:28.298
- You got his attention.
- Who wouldn't?

28:28.300 --> 28:29.660
- Alright... do the scene!
- OK

28:30.580 --> 28:31.580
Oh God.

28:32.060 --> 28:35.300
I can feel its heartbeat.

28:37.060 --> 28:38.060
Can you sing it?

28:38.140 --> 28:39.380
Sing it to the camera.

28:39.820 --> 28:40.820
On your harp.

28:42.260 --> 28:43.260
And you're dead.

28:44.260 --> 28:45.780
- And I'm dead? As well?
- Yeah.

28:45.900 --> 28:47.460
I can't go on.

28:47.540 --> 28:51.660
I can't go on! I can't.

28:52.660 --> 28:54.418
So I feel like you're
still a bit nervous.

28:54.420 --> 28:55.858
- Yes.
- Yes? OK.

28:55.860 --> 28:56.699
I am.

28:56.701 --> 28:58.220
Do you take drugs?

28:58.860 --> 29:00.940
It's not of my flesh.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.980
I just can't go on.

29:06.780 --> 29:09.060
I can't go on.

29:09.220 --> 29:10.019
OK.

29:10.021 --> 29:11.380
Ok, LSD. LSD.

29:11.580 --> 29:12.580
More arms.

29:12.700 --> 29:14.180
Free me.

29:15.140 --> 29:17.420
Free me from this...

29:17.780 --> 29:18.780
parasite.

29:19.780 --> 29:21.380
My god this is great.

29:22.180 --> 29:23.180
This is great.

29:23.740 --> 29:25.180
OK. Let's bring it home.

29:25.380 --> 29:26.596
You're on speed,
you gotta find a gun.

29:26.620 --> 29:27.938
You gotta find a gun,
you gotta kill yourself.

29:27.940 --> 29:28.658
It's in my
back pocket.

29:28.660 --> 29:29.539
- No, you can't find a gun.
- Oh.

29:29.541 --> 29:30.858
- There's no gun.
- Isn't there?

29:30.860 --> 29:31.916
So what are
you gonna use?

29:31.940 --> 29:33.380
I have to take action.

29:33.900 --> 29:34.778
It's time

29:34.780 --> 29:35.780
to die.

29:35.820 --> 29:36.818
Blarghhh!

29:36.820 --> 29:37.139
Big!

29:38.500 --> 29:39.500
Huge!

29:43.340 --> 29:44.340
OK

29:44.940 --> 29:45.940
Swim! C'mon!

29:46.140 --> 29:47.140
Around the floor. Great!

29:48.060 --> 29:49.060
You.

29:50.340 --> 29:51.260
Must.

29:51.300 --> 29:51.980
Aaargh.

29:52.020 --> 29:53.020
Aaargh.

29:53.300 --> 29:54.380
Eject out of the spaceship.

29:54.820 --> 29:55.820
Die.

29:56.500 --> 29:57.660
Into space.

29:59.020 --> 30:00.020
Bam.

30:12.140 --> 30:18.020
And slowly she
chokes to death.

30:19.180 --> 30:20.180
OK

30:22.620 --> 30:24.580
How'd that feel Zoey?

30:25.180 --> 30:25.860
Better?

30:26.060 --> 30:27.060
A little bit awkward.

30:27.220 --> 30:28.700
- Awkward?
- Mm-hmm.

30:28.820 --> 30:31.058
What part was
awkward for you?

30:31.060 --> 30:33.018
Because I feel like you had
a breakthrough today.

30:33.020 --> 30:34.420
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:36.980 --> 30:37.980
Course I'm pissed.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.300
Why wouldn't I be pissed?

30:40.540 --> 30:41.978
Well because
it was funny.

30:41.980 --> 30:43.218
- This was a
shitty stunt.

30:43.220 --> 30:44.498
- And you were laughing.
- I was laughing for

30:44.500 --> 30:46.538
the first three but you didn't
give anyone a real script.

30:46.540 --> 30:49.180
C'mon man they
didn't give me anything.

30:49.300 --> 30:51.100
A couple of them were
at least committing.

30:51.220 --> 30:52.258
You gotta give them that.

30:52.260 --> 30:53.996
They were committed,
I'lll give them that

30:55.060 --> 30:56.060
What did you do?

30:56.220 --> 30:57.220
I didn't.

31:00.660 --> 31:03.180
Katie was wondering
if she could audition?

31:03.820 --> 31:04.820
- Script?
- Yep.

31:05.660 --> 31:08.338
Sure. We've been
using this one all day.

31:08.340 --> 31:10.580
- Cool
- There you go.

31:13.420 --> 31:14.900
An alien fetus?

31:15.420 --> 31:16.060
-Really?

31:16.420 --> 31:17.220
-Is it?

31:17.260 --> 31:18.258
Is that the actual script?

31:18.260 --> 31:19.219
No.

31:19.221 --> 31:21.338
That's.. That's something else.

31:21.340 --> 31:22.738
Very good!

31:22.740 --> 31:24.700
You made
these women read this?

31:27.460 --> 31:28.898
Just humour me ok?

31:28.900 --> 31:30.218
- Give it to Katie.
- No.

31:30.220 --> 31:32.620
Just have a look.
I got this one for Katie.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.260
Read aloud, maybe?

31:39.620 --> 31:40.620
Read aloud?

31:42.420 --> 31:43.420
You're still up?

31:46.860 --> 31:48.620
I haven't
been to sleep yet.

31:50.060 --> 31:51.540
I looked in earlier.

31:52.220 --> 31:53.220
You were asleep.

31:54.820 --> 31:55.820
Are you sure?

31:56.740 --> 31:57.740
Can I come in?

32:00.900 --> 32:04.098
Your eyes were open
but you were still sleeping.

32:04.100 --> 32:05.900
It was freaky.

32:06.780 --> 32:08.420
I couldn't sleep.

32:09.300 --> 32:10.980
I need to talk to you.

32:13.660 --> 32:16.300
Yeah…?

32:17.340 --> 32:18.340
Is that OK?

32:20.300 --> 32:23.460
The last few months have been..
Have been awesome alright?

32:23.620 --> 32:25.940
I've never met anyone
like you before.

32:26.420 --> 32:28.058
Do you feel the same
way about me?

32:28.060 --> 32:29.978
Yeah. I do.

32:29.980 --> 32:31.538
It's totally changed
the way I think

32:31.540 --> 32:32.900
about everything, I was...

32:33.140 --> 32:36.060
I was waiting for so long to
meet someone like you and..

32:36.900 --> 32:38.340
And then I did and ..

32:39.460 --> 32:41.460
I guess you know what
I'm going to ask next?

32:43.540 --> 32:44.540
Right?

32:45.300 --> 32:47.660
I, I don't want to
rush you but..

32:48.100 --> 32:49.580
I mean how long?

32:52.020 --> 32:53.620
I'm so sorry, I want to...

32:53.660 --> 32:55.218
Are you scared
or something,

32:55.220 --> 32:57.340
are you still on your
v-plates, I mean..

33:00.940 --> 33:01.740
No.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.138
Is it to do
with your dream?

33:03.140 --> 33:04.140
I can't...

33:04.540 --> 33:06.738
I can't talk about this,
it has to stay inside my dreams.

33:06.740 --> 33:07.978
What has to stay
inside your dreams?

33:07.980 --> 33:10.098
Just drop it please,
if you care for me Dane.

33:10.100 --> 33:12.098
- Look if you just tell
- You can't help me.

33:12.100 --> 33:14.140
You said my eyes were open…

33:14.420 --> 33:16.260
- before…
- Yeah..

33:16.860 --> 33:17.860
I was awake.

33:19.500 --> 33:19.979
No but…

33:19.981 --> 33:22.620
He visits me
every night. Dane.

33:23.660 --> 33:26.298
I'm in that twilight moment
just about to sleep

33:26.300 --> 33:28.540
and I feel him on me.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.860
I feel him breathing.

33:31.860 --> 33:33.300
I feel him in me.

33:33.780 --> 33:34.780
His smell.

33:37.740 --> 33:39.740
He touches me Dane.

33:40.980 --> 33:45.100
He holds me down with his
bodyweight his fingers, they …

33:45.260 --> 33:46.938
There, there are ..
Reasons you know,

33:46.940 --> 33:48.898
anxiety maybe
some repressed memory.

33:48.900 --> 33:51.658
I try to struggle,
I want to but my arms,

33:51.660 --> 33:53.780
they are like they are
too heavy to move.

33:53.940 --> 33:55.938
It's like I'm paralysed.

33:55.940 --> 33:57.620
I can't… I can't
put my legs back together.

34:02.660 --> 34:03.820
But he doesn't finish it off.

34:04.300 --> 34:06.258
He wants to delay his pleasure.

34:06.260 --> 34:07.099
No Chloe come here.

34:07.101 --> 34:08.297
To enjoy the waiting.

34:08.300 --> 34:11.060
You're safe with me.
Alright. I promise.

34:14.340 --> 34:15.340
I'm sorry.

34:16.780 --> 34:19.900
- I can't keep going like this.
- No, no. We're in this together.

34:20.219 --> 34:22.380
Alright. I'm going to
see you through this.

34:22.820 --> 34:23.820
I see his face.

34:24.580 --> 34:26.940
Good. Alright.
That's a start maybe.

34:27.980 --> 34:29.820
He looks like you.

34:30.620 --> 34:33.900
- Then we embrace…
- Make out!

34:37.020 --> 34:39.217
Cool. That's nasty.

34:39.219 --> 34:40.338
that's your copy.

34:40.340 --> 34:41.460
Shae..

34:41.820 --> 34:43.378
Just give it a read. Come on.

34:43.380 --> 34:44.380
Thanks anyway.

34:44.940 --> 34:45.779
Please.

34:45.781 --> 34:46.835
I'll read your
damn script.

34:47.860 --> 34:49.380
That was disturbing.

34:49.500 --> 34:50.500
Wooo.

34:52.900 --> 34:54.739
- See ya.
- Bye.

34:55.020 --> 34:56.020
Thank you.

34:56.580 --> 34:57.580
Bye Shae.

35:04.020 --> 35:05.860
That could've
been worse.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.900
Why does she keep
doing this to me?

35:12.300 --> 35:13.300
Least she came back.

35:13.500 --> 35:14.500
Oh my god.

35:14.980 --> 35:15.980
She read it.

35:17.340 --> 35:18.660
I was touched.

35:20.460 --> 35:21.898
If you care for me Kurt

35:21.900 --> 35:23.018
If you just talk to me

35:23.020 --> 35:24.498
maybe we can work it out.

35:24.500 --> 35:25.580
You can't help me.

35:25.700 --> 35:26.700
Trust me.

35:27.140 --> 35:28.820
I'm in that
twilight moment

35:29.180 --> 35:31.380
and I'm just about to
go to sleep and …

35:31.660 --> 35:33.380
and I can feel him …

35:34.660 --> 35:35.660
on me.

35:35.780 --> 35:37.900
Took her three
hours to get in the room.

35:38.260 --> 35:40.620
I thought she was going
to throw a fit. But..

35:40.700 --> 35:41.700
Look at her.

35:43.140 --> 35:44.140
She could carry this.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.140
Yeah. She's good.

35:47.620 --> 35:48.700
You gotta call her.

35:51.100 --> 35:52.620
Okey dokey.

35:53.300 --> 35:54.060
I'm serious man.

35:54.300 --> 35:55.338
- Yep.
- And you gotta be nice.

35:55.340 --> 35:56.219
You gotta apologize.

35:56.221 --> 35:57.500
Yeah she's.. she's good.

35:57.940 --> 35:59.780
- Yeah?
- Promise you'll apologize?

36:00.300 --> 36:01.938
What? No. No,
I'm not going to apologize.

36:01.940 --> 36:03.740
What do you mean you're
not going to apologize

36:03.780 --> 36:05.420
At least be nice. Just be nice.

36:06.820 --> 36:09.540
Some weird number
has been ringing me all day.

36:11.500 --> 36:12.500
I might do a VLOG.

36:15.180 --> 36:16.900
You know the expression

36:17.420 --> 36:19.700
"this film is the sum of
all my compromises"

36:20.700 --> 36:23.418
well, I don't know who said
that but I feel like

36:23.420 --> 36:24.900
they knew me really well.

36:26.580 --> 36:27.580
But then again…

36:32.500 --> 36:35.540
Kurt. Where the
hell is your office?

36:36.260 --> 36:38.100
What are you doing here?

36:38.660 --> 36:39.660
Umm..

36:40.420 --> 36:41.660
I read your script.

36:43.980 --> 36:44.980
You liked it?

36:45.780 --> 36:46.780
Aaah..

36:47.620 --> 36:49.060
Yeah it's very dark…

36:49.700 --> 36:50.700
and strange.

36:51.220 --> 36:53.420
I don't know, I felt really um…

36:53.980 --> 36:55.540
yeah… Strange.

36:55.620 --> 36:56.620
All day after I read it.

36:57.940 --> 36:58.940
- Umm..
- So…

36:59.860 --> 37:00.860
So…

37:01.700 --> 37:03.380
I want to do this film.

37:04.100 --> 37:05.100
Kurt.

37:05.460 --> 37:07.380
I don't want to do, you know..

37:07.420 --> 37:08.538
I don't need a blockbuster,

37:08.540 --> 37:10.338
I don't want anything
more than this, this..

37:10.340 --> 37:13.060
This interests me
and it's very …

37:13.220 --> 37:14.220
true.

37:14.580 --> 37:15.580
So…

37:16.500 --> 37:19.540
Can you do that?
Can you just give me this film?

37:20.860 --> 37:22.500
You..?

37:23.060 --> 37:24.540
I.. I mean.. Yeah.

37:25.140 --> 37:26.140
Really?

37:26.220 --> 37:27.220
Really.

37:32.140 --> 37:34.938
Yeah, OK. I solemnly swear
that I will deliver to you

37:34.940 --> 37:39.060
upon my life a film that
is full of truth and, and,

37:39.140 --> 37:42.698
note and, and substance
and you will star in it

37:42.700 --> 37:45.898
and I will deliver it to the
cinemas of the world.

37:45.900 --> 37:47.938
- OK.
- OK.

37:47.940 --> 37:48.940
Thank you.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.738
Sorry. You just…

37:53.740 --> 37:55.180
you have no idea..

37:56.260 --> 37:57.260
Aaagh

37:58.700 --> 37:59.700
You have no idea.

37:59.740 --> 38:01.378
OK. Awesome.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.700
OK? Shae.

38:05.060 --> 38:07.058
Would you like to step
into my office?

38:07.060 --> 38:08.060
I would.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.500
Brian's going to
shit himself.

39:02.660 --> 39:03.660
Sorry. Just in..

39:05.340 --> 39:07.740
Sorry, do you want us to
put it up here or down there?

39:43.620 --> 39:46.780
Nobody told me
about filmin' on the boat.

40:21.740 --> 40:23.658
I'll read a
little bit, anyway.

40:23.660 --> 40:24.660
Right.

40:25.300 --> 40:27.658
Alright. Ready?

40:27.660 --> 40:28.659
Yes.

40:28.661 --> 40:30.458
July 29th.

40:30.460 --> 40:33.220
"She had a distaste
for the work.

40:33.500 --> 40:35.138
This man had.."

40:35.140 --> 40:37.258
This writing is so bad.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.698
Aaah.. something.

40:39.700 --> 40:42.260
So Edmund came
down this river?

40:42.460 --> 40:43.900
No.

40:43.980 --> 40:45.858
Gladestone.

40:45.860 --> 40:46.900
- What?
- OK

40:47.540 --> 40:50.138
This is Gladestone.
He's the good guy.

40:50.140 --> 40:51.140
This is Edmund.

40:51.180 --> 40:53.418
Oh c'mon,
they look the same!

40:53.420 --> 40:54.420
No they don't!

40:55.580 --> 40:57.018
And you're related to Edmund?

40:57.020 --> 40:59.860
No I'm related, I'm related
to Gladestone, the good guy.

41:00.100 --> 41:01.100
OK.

41:01.380 --> 41:02.860
This is Beatrice.

41:03.060 --> 41:04.060
She was…

41:04.540 --> 41:08.260
Gladestone's beau but
Edmund's fiancée.

41:08.460 --> 41:10.420
Yeah but she was
married to Gladestone.

41:10.860 --> 41:14.858
No. That was after Gladestone
pulled a total Mr Darcy on her.

41:14.860 --> 41:16.020
OK. Wait.

41:16.180 --> 41:17.538
Who's Mr Darcy?

41:18.620 --> 41:21.140
It's just someone else.

41:21.620 --> 41:23.098
OK so Beatrice …

41:23.100 --> 41:27.618
Beatrice is like this
aristocratic debutante

41:27.620 --> 41:29.138
...listen... Sorry.

41:29.140 --> 41:31.220
then her father
married her off to this..

41:31.620 --> 41:33.196
- guy..
- rich guy in Tassie.

41:33.220 --> 41:34.220
But, but …

41:34.460 --> 41:36.258
by the time she got here
he'd died of pox

41:36.260 --> 41:37.259
so she was just left.

41:37.261 --> 41:39.018
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

41:39.020 --> 41:41.218
So Edmund wanted to buy
all of this guy's land,

41:41.220 --> 41:42.340
that she was going to marry,

41:42.500 --> 41:44.180
and then he wanted
her in the deal as well.

41:44.420 --> 41:46.178
Buying a wife
and a house.

41:46.180 --> 41:47.738
- Yeah.
- So he just bought her?

41:47.740 --> 41:49.700
- Yeah. He tried to.
- Pretty much.

41:50.060 --> 41:51.300
How do you know so much?

41:51.900 --> 41:53.340
Because I've read the book.

41:53.820 --> 41:55.940
It's called a Journal.

42:02.460 --> 42:07.860
She's smart…
sexy… insightful… brave…

42:08.580 --> 42:09.940
Incredibly courageous.

42:11.220 --> 42:11.819
- She's athletic.
- OK she's just

42:11.821 --> 42:13.980
- very perfect.
- She's blond.

42:14.940 --> 42:16.940
- Yeah?
- Well she's like the

42:17.220 --> 42:18.860
the Madonna of the
piece you know.

42:19.020 --> 42:21.340
- Yeah… yeah, yeah.
- She's the saviour.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.156
- The guardian angel.
- It's a bit boring.

42:23.180 --> 42:25.138
How about I look for some
problems to give her?

42:25.140 --> 42:26.620
Some kind of, I don't
know, something.

42:27.300 --> 42:28.340
- Something.
- Yeah.

42:28.780 --> 42:30.098
Something.. kind of .. challenge.

42:30.100 --> 42:31.738
well look, we'll look
at the script together later

42:31.740 --> 42:32.738
I gotta check on..

42:32.740 --> 42:33.740
don't run away.

42:35.300 --> 42:36.538
I'm talking to you
about this later.

42:36.540 --> 42:38.060
Yes we will
I promise. Later.

42:45.900 --> 42:47.140
You Yanks.

42:47.180 --> 42:49.660
Don't know shit about
the world. Do ya?

42:50.060 --> 42:52.298
Do you know why there's
no blackfellas in Tassie?

42:52.300 --> 42:53.500
Actually yeah. We do.

42:53.900 --> 42:56.181
They clean killed
every last fucken one of them.

42:56.580 --> 42:58.220
Strung ‘em up from the trees.

42:58.380 --> 42:59.940
Yeah well we know that.

43:00.260 --> 43:02.420
You related to
Gladestone Michaels eh?

43:02.500 --> 43:03.820
What do you
know about him?

43:04.580 --> 43:06.258
I know enough to stay
the fuck away from

43:06.260 --> 43:07.540
where you're going.

43:08.700 --> 43:10.380
Why.. why..
What does that mean?

43:10.420 --> 43:11.219
What you..?

43:11.221 --> 43:13.660
You know your fella killed the
worst bastard that ever

43:13.700 --> 43:14.700
lived on this island?

43:15.260 --> 43:16.660
- Stole his woman?
- Yeah.

43:16.820 --> 43:17.820
Be a smart fella.

43:19.580 --> 43:21.100
We can drop you here.

43:21.180 --> 43:22.756
You don't have to go
anywhere near there.

43:22.780 --> 43:24.420
No, no it has to
be authentic.

43:31.220 --> 43:32.738
Tide says we
won't get back in

43:32.740 --> 43:34.418
till sparrow's fart Monday.

43:34.420 --> 43:35.780
So still be dark then?

43:35.980 --> 43:37.460
We'll set two flares.

43:37.860 --> 43:40.060
Don't miss ‘em.
We're not coming back for you.

43:41.220 --> 43:42.740
You can swim out.

43:43.620 --> 43:45.980
Can you pull it
in a bit more?

43:46.540 --> 43:49.100
Ooh ooh I'm going to cry..

43:49.780 --> 43:51.820
- There you go.
- Yay!

43:53.020 --> 43:54.900
- Chuck the rest of the bags over.
- Yep.

43:55.500 --> 43:57.340
And easy..
You got the rope?

43:57.540 --> 43:59.980
- Woah woah..
- Oh no.

44:00.620 --> 44:01.938
I just had a
heart attack.

44:01.940 --> 44:03.340
Oh man don't
worry about it.

44:06.580 --> 44:09.858
Grant, it's up this way.
Oh Grant! Grant.

44:09.860 --> 44:12.858
Can you um get a shot
of the boat leaving?

44:12.860 --> 44:14.700
Way ahead of you.

45:11.020 --> 45:11.779
Fuck!

45:11.781 --> 45:13.778
Whoah. Careful Camo.

45:13.780 --> 45:14.619
Cheers mate.

45:14.621 --> 45:16.340
Got our film
in your backpack.

45:16.700 --> 45:19.100
Oh. Doing the
best I can eh?

45:19.740 --> 45:21.740
- No worries, you right?
- yeah, yeah.

45:24.541 --> 45:25.938
hey Grant can you
get some coverage of us

45:25.940 --> 45:27.060
walking up the trail?

45:27.180 --> 45:29.180
Aah, not quite sure
what you're after mate?

45:29.340 --> 45:32.018
If um, if Camo and
Brian go up a little further

45:32.020 --> 45:33.858
and get out of the shot
and you could go from behind

45:33.860 --> 45:36.818
and shoot the three of us
walking up for a while?

45:36.820 --> 45:38.018
Sure. Everyone
take a break,

45:38.020 --> 45:39.020
take about 15 to set up.

45:39.060 --> 45:41.418
We don't really
have 15 actually. We're ..

45:41.420 --> 45:42.578
It's just 15 minutes.

45:42.580 --> 45:44.220
we're on a
tight schedule dude.

45:45.020 --> 45:46.658
No. I think we
should do it.

45:46.660 --> 45:49.300
We got a lot of ground
to cover, look at this hill.

45:51.460 --> 45:53.500
Well um, what if I do it,

45:53.540 --> 45:55.060
I' m all set up,
I can just drop back.

45:56.180 --> 45:57.660
- Aaah..
- Oh yeah.

45:57.980 --> 45:59.578
- I don't know..
- For the film..?

45:59.580 --> 46:00.580
If we get split up..

46:00.660 --> 46:02.098
Yeah. We could do it on
that camera for a bit.

46:02.100 --> 46:03.778
If you get lost or
something happens

46:03.780 --> 46:04.779
He's looking at us
through the lens,

46:04.781 --> 46:06.338
how's he going to get lost?

46:06.340 --> 46:07.356
I don't know, I'm just saying.

46:07.380 --> 46:09.700
Mate, she'll be sweet.
I'll be careful.

46:09.900 --> 46:10.900
He'll be careful.

46:11.900 --> 46:12.940
He'll be careful, come on.

46:15.940 --> 46:16.940
Oh shit.

46:18.260 --> 46:19.260
Can't believe this.

46:24.020 --> 46:25.540
Where the fuck are they?

46:27.260 --> 46:28.260
Shit.

46:30.020 --> 46:32.180

49:37.580 --> 49:38.580
Look at that man.

49:39.700 --> 49:41.060
It's all over it.

49:43.700 --> 49:46.060
Woah, there's heaps.

49:48.100 --> 49:50.220
Oh it's gross.

49:53.380 --> 49:54.740

it's a disease?

49:54.980 --> 49:56.940
- Guys, what is it?
- Damn!

49:59.380 --> 50:00.698
That's disgusting.

50:00.700 --> 50:01.700
Can we go?

50:02.380 --> 50:03.380
Guys lets get..

50:06.020 --> 50:07.020

50:10.540 --> 50:11.540

50:13.740 --> 50:14.740
I'm good. Brian..

50:14.940 --> 50:18.700
Brian. Could we use this
as a backdrop you think?

50:19.380 --> 50:21.700
Either this one
or the next one, man.

50:22.820 --> 50:24.538
We got to stay on time though.
It's either…

50:24.540 --> 50:26.858
How about while you two
pontificate I set up

50:26.860 --> 50:28.220
and we actually get a shot.

50:29.660 --> 50:30.660
A walkie?

50:31.140 --> 50:33.540
Or something so we can
be on our way anyway?

50:36.100 --> 50:37.540
We recording
sound on this?

50:37.860 --> 50:38.699
No.

50:38.701 --> 50:40.620
Just stay in character is all.

50:42.180 --> 50:44.460
Are we happy or sad or..

50:44.740 --> 50:45.618
Scared?

50:45.620 --> 50:46.620
Um we're..

50:47.460 --> 50:49.220
You know, happy to be together.

50:50.340 --> 50:52.060
Still scared as well.

50:52.620 --> 50:54.460
OK, so which
is the main one?

50:56.060 --> 50:57.060
Um..

50:58.500 --> 51:00.100
- Scared. Fearful.
- OK.

51:00.340 --> 51:00.860
Sure?

51:01.340 --> 51:03.220
Yeah I'm .. I'm sure.

51:06.260 --> 51:07.260
What do you mean?

51:09.060 --> 51:10.620
I don't mean anything.
It's just …

51:12.780 --> 51:15.458
Kurt, don't flip out. It's fine.
Everyone has their own way

51:15.460 --> 51:17.380
No it's not … fine.

51:19.500 --> 51:21.460
- OK.. well..
- Not fine.

51:21.700 --> 51:23.500
Chloe really doesn't
have much edge.

51:24.060 --> 51:25.460
What does she want?

51:25.580 --> 51:27.020
She wants to save Dane.

51:29.060 --> 51:30.418
What else?

51:30.420 --> 51:32.100
What does she want for herself?

51:33.500 --> 51:34.820
SHOT!

51:35.060 --> 51:36.620
CAMO! In shot mate!

51:36.740 --> 51:39.060
Is..? Sorry Grant!

51:39.660 --> 51:41.340
Don't give up your day job.

51:42.140 --> 51:43.139
Dickhead.

51:43.141 --> 51:44.301
- Reset.
- Yep!

51:46.580 --> 51:47.938
It has to mean something.

51:47.940 --> 51:48.819
Maybe.

51:48.821 --> 51:51.458
He.. he like
mentions the teeth..

51:51.460 --> 51:53.236
- eww.
- What's that, show us.

51:53.260 --> 51:54.260
Oh man.

51:54.980 --> 51:56.978
Those teeth
are the worst.

51:56.980 --> 51:57.979
Hey!

51:57.981 --> 52:00.660
- No, no, no, OK, OK.
- Just a little tooth.

52:02.140 --> 52:04.898
He mentioned some unspeakable
evil that he can't name,

52:04.900 --> 52:06.220
maybe it was..

52:06.780 --> 52:08.338
I don't know. Murder.

52:10.500 --> 52:11.500
I don't know.

52:11.700 --> 52:14.980
I just think this is
a box of nothing.

52:15.340 --> 52:17.380
Just a bunch of old
junk that he had.

52:17.660 --> 52:19.260
I'm not sure if there's
a curse in there.

52:19.780 --> 52:22.340
I think it's just
Beatrice's stuff.

52:34.780 --> 52:35.780
Ugh!

52:39.700 --> 52:40.980
Oh wow!

52:41.860 --> 52:42.860
Oh my god.

52:46.380 --> 52:47.380
Oh my god!

52:48.820 --> 52:51.180
Oh you guys look at this.

52:52.780 --> 52:53.780
Brian?

52:54.500 --> 52:55.940
He's afraid of
heights mate.

52:56.340 --> 52:57.778
Yeah, I know.

52:57.780 --> 53:00.098
It's alright man, don't worry.
Look we'll find the stairs yeah?

53:02.260 --> 53:03.618
We gotta
keep going round.

53:03.620 --> 53:05.938
Woah, OK guys, he's going
to vomit, he's gonna…

53:05.940 --> 53:06.778
just stand back.

53:06.780 --> 53:07.780

53:10.740 --> 53:11.740
C'mon…

53:12.420 --> 53:14.540

53:14.860 --> 53:15.898
It's alright, we're
not in a rush,

53:15.900 --> 53:17.100
just sit down if you want.

53:17.140 --> 53:18.180
Take your time bro.

53:20.340 --> 53:21.500
He's going to be sick.

53:22.700 --> 53:23.539
Woo!

53:24.740 --> 53:25.740
Here you go Brian.

53:25.860 --> 53:27.140
Perfect. You can
be sick in here.

53:27.820 --> 53:29.900
At least I can
puke anywhere, right?

53:30.941 --> 53:33.020
Oooh!

53:53.100 --> 53:54.100
Cut! Cut!

53:54.420 --> 53:55.419
Hang on. Wait, wait.

53:55.421 --> 53:57.940
No, no, no, no go back, back,
back, back, back alright.

53:58.820 --> 54:00.460
Steady. I'm not…

54:00.700 --> 54:01.700
It's not authentic.

54:02.820 --> 54:05.356
Alright we're not picking it up on
the camera that you're actually …

54:05.380 --> 54:07.098
We need to see what Grace
is seeing alright?

54:07.100 --> 54:09.220
So.. so… what's going on?

54:09.660 --> 54:10.980
I'm at the edge of a cliff.

54:11.940 --> 54:12.940
Are you scared?

54:13.500 --> 54:14.500
- Yeah!
- Well USE that.

54:14.660 --> 54:16.900
Use the fear alright.
Use that real fear.

54:18.100 --> 54:19.100
Um…

54:20.300 --> 54:22.180
- So…
- Kurt... safety please.

54:23.700 --> 54:24.980
Eh Kurt mate… Come on.

54:25.140 --> 54:26.898
What we're going to do is…

54:26.900 --> 54:27.900
Stand there.

54:29.100 --> 54:30.420
OK now… Katie?

54:31.100 --> 54:32.140
Can we get another scream?

54:33.380 --> 54:34.380
Scream.

54:35.540 --> 54:36.540
Scream…

54:41.620 --> 54:42.619
Nup. Scream.

54:42.621 --> 54:44.698
- Stop!
- Scream again. For real.

54:45.820 --> 54:46.820

54:46.860 --> 54:47.859

54:47.861 --> 54:50.620

54:53.700 --> 54:56.458
That's SO much better OK?
That's what I'm talking about.

54:56.460 --> 54:57.676
What the fuck

54:57.700 --> 54:58.820
Grant? What the hell?

54:59.060 --> 54:59.778
Did we not get that?

54:59.780 --> 55:00.779
Course we didn't get that.
There's no way in hell

55:00.781 --> 55:02.378
- we could use that.
- Are you serious?

55:02.380 --> 55:03.836
If her agent saw
that we are both fucked.

55:03.860 --> 55:04.858
Alright Katie. Katie …

55:04.860 --> 55:05.858
Another one?

55:05.860 --> 55:06.699
Kurt, no.

55:06.701 --> 55:08.740
One more. C'mon.

55:09.980 --> 55:11.898
No fucking way.

55:11.900 --> 55:12.900
Come on. Fuck.

55:14.700 --> 55:16.298
- There's no way we could use
- We gotta move on anyway

55:16.300 --> 55:18.060
- could use any of that.
- C'mon guys. C'mon.

55:18.660 --> 55:19.658
Yeah, look I'm sorry.

55:19.660 --> 55:20.660
I should have asked.

55:21.060 --> 55:22.698
I should have asked. I just,
I want it to be the best

55:22.700 --> 55:23.699
performance it could be,
you want that right?

55:23.701 --> 55:25.178
Well yeah! You should
have asked me first.

55:25.180 --> 55:27.276
Yeah I know! I should
have asked but I just didn't

55:27.300 --> 55:28.140
want to fuck up your focus.

55:28.180 --> 55:30.498
OK maybe if we just set up
some ground rules

55:30.500 --> 55:32.338
then maybe in the
future we'll be fine.

55:32.340 --> 55:34.060
I knew..
I knew you would say that.

55:34.140 --> 55:35.178
You're meant to
trust your director.

55:35.180 --> 55:36.236
You have to
earn our trust.

55:36.260 --> 55:37.098
Exactly.

55:37.100 --> 55:38.099
Try to get along.

55:38.101 --> 55:39.738
Try being a little more
positive with your notes.

55:39.740 --> 55:40.739
- We're making an awesome…
- Yes.

55:40.741 --> 55:41.778
What the fuck is
the point of being here?

55:41.780 --> 55:42.858
Totally. It has
to be awesome.

55:42.860 --> 55:44.178
Yes OK. So you
agree with me.

55:44.180 --> 55:45.580
Yes I agree, Can we GO!?

56:27.540 --> 56:29.540
Oh… Fuck!

56:38.900 --> 56:39.700
Let's roll man.

56:39.740 --> 56:40.740
Shut up Kurt.

56:43.020 --> 56:45.180
We're on a tight
schedule remember.

56:46.140 --> 56:47.378
- C'mon man,
- Kurt, Kurt, Kurt.

56:47.380 --> 56:48.380
[Kurt let's do it.

56:50.620 --> 56:52.620
Kurt I don't know
how I'm going to do this.

56:54.820 --> 56:57.498
As you said man we're on a
schedule, we gotta roll so..

56:57.500 --> 56:59.098
Could you just give
me hand please?

56:59.100 --> 57:00.298
Where were you when
I needed you man?

57:00.300 --> 57:01.660
You didn't have my back.

57:02.060 --> 57:03.500
You.. you were being a dick.

57:03.900 --> 57:05.938
Just keep feeling the
wall with that hand

57:05.940 --> 57:07.940
and edge along.
You're fine and I got you.

57:09.380 --> 57:11.580
Just keep feeling
along like a crab.

57:14.900 --> 57:15.698
Like a crab.

57:15.700 --> 57:16.659
Like that? Like..

57:16.661 --> 57:18.100
Be the crab.

57:18.780 --> 57:20.420
Perfect.
You're doing really well.

57:20.500 --> 57:22.140
- OK.
- Really well.

58:32.340 --> 58:33.780
Hang on.

58:35.660 --> 58:37.740
Guys, the sound sucks!

58:43.140 --> 58:44.500
Listen to this man.

59:10.860 --> 59:12.500
We have to film it here?

59:13.180 --> 59:14.860
In this place really?

59:19.740 --> 59:20.780
It's freaking me out.

59:21.780 --> 59:23.340
Yeah well OK
there's something…

59:24.180 --> 59:25.180
here.

59:26.580 --> 59:28.980
We're going to capture it in
the camera and it's going to be…

59:29.460 --> 59:30.460
exceptional.

59:31.100 --> 59:32.780
You're not
helping me Kurt.

59:33.140 --> 59:35.220
Gladestone knew it.

59:35.780 --> 59:37.540
I wonder what
Gladestone knew.

59:39.900 --> 59:40.900
What do you mean?

59:41.340 --> 59:45.060
I mean he only ever
gave us half the story,

59:45.100 --> 59:46.580
what is he hiding?

59:47.300 --> 59:50.780
Nothing. He killed a guy.
He had to be careful.

59:52.060 --> 59:54.180
He was obsessed
with that curse.

59:54.220 --> 59:55.340
He was scared to death.

59:55.380 --> 59:56.858
He wasn't, wasn't scared.

59:56.860 --> 59:58.420
He never let it go.

59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.620
He thought that the ghost of
Edmund had it in for him.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.620
You are Gladestone's descendant.
You should think about that.

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.340
OK.

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.540
Here we are.

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.100
In the Styx valley.

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:51.820
What a place.

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:54.980
I…

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:59.780
I can't shake this feeling
like I have been here before.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.260
It's so weird, it's like..

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:08.980
It's like a psychic echo
handed down from my relative.

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.138
You know Gladestone went
right through here

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:12.420
on his way to Edmund.

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:15.940
He had his Journal,
I have my film.

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:18.020
I guess we're linked
in that way.

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.020
Except..

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:22.978
He never fulfilled his mission to
reveal the horrors of Edmund

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:23.980
to the world.

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:26.940
Just think,

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:28.980
when this film comes out

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.540
that dream will be fulfilled.

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:36.700
Nearly 200 years later

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:40.060
I'm going to finish
what he started.

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:09.458
- It needs a love scene!
- I know! I know.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.340
I agree. It does.

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.898
But a sex scene however …

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.778
No, it's not a sex scene OK

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:17.780
It's completely tasteful.

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:21.140
It will be filmed tastefully.

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:23.660
Yeah.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.458
There's usually a way
to do this you know.

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.938
You go.. you talk to my agent,

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:29.660
- you sign a contract..
- Yeah.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.178
you can't just chuck
it in when we're about to do it.

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.740
OK. Uh-huh. Yep.

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.778
I mean what nudity is it?
How much? How's it shot?

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:38.500
I'm not hiding anything,
it's in the script.

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:40.618
It's not about the nudity.
The nudity is just…

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:41.858
It's a part of it.
For me..

01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:42.860
It's a part of it..

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:44.818
Yeah? Can that go?

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:48.058
Were you even going to ask me?

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:49.060
Yes of course.

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:50.300
When?

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:51.420
OK.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:52.900
Well it's fine then.

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.100
- OK. Bye.
- I'm making changes.

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.940
I'm making changes.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:06.620
Good.

01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:09.340
- Sound.
- Rolling.

01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:10.716
- You right Kurt?
- Yup.

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:13.978
Alright. 36A Take 3.

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:14.980
Mark it.

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:19.020
- Camera set.

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:20.220
- Camera set.

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:21.820
Action.

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.060
You awake?

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:29.580
I am now.

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:32.980
I can't sleep.

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.580
You must have a
guilty conscience.

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:40.220
I have sinned.

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:44.340
Confess sinner.

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:49.420
My thoughts..

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:51.700
Have been impure.

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:55.580
That sounds serious.

01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:59.900
Have you given over to
these impure thoughts?

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.300
Not yet. But um…

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:06.780
I fear I might.

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:10.858
It doesn't look like you're
trying very hard.

01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:11.860
I'm …

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.258
fighting with every
fiber of my soul.

01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.020
I'm not… ready.

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:21.340
What're you waiting for?

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:27.820
You have no idea of
boundaries K.. Kurt.

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:29.820
Oh..

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:34.740
Sorry. Dane.
Let's go again. I lost focus.

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.100
No. I was going to cut anyway.

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.020
What's going on?

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:40.340
What?

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:41.858
You have some notes?

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:43.940
Yeah I do.
This scene is all about

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:47.138
Chloe's powerful attraction to
Dane and the fact that she

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.338
wants to give over her
body to him as well as..

01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:51.380
- Kurt, you knew that..
- .. her soul.

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:54.700
You knew that I saw her as
still deciding at this point.

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:58.700
OK, shes, shes deciding whether
Dane is dependable.

01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:00.140
And safe.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:08.220
Why are both of you fighting me
at every step of the way huh?

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:11.618
You're not seeing the
bigger picture at all,

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.620
OK, it's ..

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.020
You're holding back
and your priorities are all…

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:20.020
Roll again.

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.060
Can I just have a moment?

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:24.180
Roll again.

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.580
You awake?

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:39.220
I am now.

01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:42.860
Can't sleep.

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.580
You must have a
guilty conscience.

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:50.340
I have sinned.

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:54.060
Confess sinner.

01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:58.900
My thoughts have been impure.

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.180
Well that sounds serious.

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:06.460
Have you given over to
these impure thoughts?

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:09.100
Not yet.

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:14.900
But I fear I might.

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:19.658
Doesn't look like you're
trying very hard.

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.100
I'm fighting with every
fiber of my soul.

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:26.220
Not ready.

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:29.980
Relax

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:36.020
You have no ideas of
boundaries Dane.

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:39.740
No.

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:42.540
I don't.

01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:47.340
Out here we make our own rules.

01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:56.060
What was that!

01:06:58.700 --> 01:06:59.700
Oh shit!

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:03.580
Grant! Get up!

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:08.380
Oh shit Camo!

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:10.020
Grant, get up.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:10.780
What

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:12.460
- There's something
out there.

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:13.580
What the fuck?

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:17.100
Something weird
out here man.

01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:18.340
Camo!

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:22.820
Camo! Yeah.

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:24.378
What the fuck is that?

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.380
It's Devils.

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:27.300
What do you mean "Devils"?

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:28.818
- Tasmanian Devils.
- Get them away!

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:30.220
Get them away!

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:31.860
Camo!

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:32.940
What?

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:36.020
What's going on?

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:39.738
I should wake
him up right?

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:40.916
No man.
You're not supposed to.

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:41.619
You sure?

01:07:41.621 --> 01:07:42.701
Yeah just leave him.

01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:08.300
Did you hear that?

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:12.060
What was that?

01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:17.899
Fuck this, I'm waking him.

01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:19.700
Fuck!

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:22.859
Dude, is he still awake?

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:24.180
No, no.

01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:26.620
He's out.

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:28.300
So weird.

01:08:28.859 --> 01:08:29.859
Kurt.

01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.060
Kurt.

01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:34.580
Kurt.

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:50.180
Fuck.

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:57.140
Kurt where the
hell are we going?

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:00.460
He said he saw
this place in his…

01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:01.580
dream.

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.620
Dream?

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:04.220
Do you have a map?

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:10.340
I knew this log would be here.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.540
It's like being on a
conveyor belt.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.500
C'mon. Guys!

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:23.740
Nearly there.

01:09:24.939 --> 01:09:25.939
Wooooh!

01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:27.540
Look at this!

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:31.180
I told you look at this.

01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:32.819
I told you.

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:35.020
This is it.

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.260
I told you this is exactly it.

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.380
This is the exact place I saw.

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:45.580
Let's set up Grant.

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:47.698
Get the camera.

01:09:47.701 --> 01:09:49.300
Get it in the can.

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:06.660
Cut!

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.260
Cut, cut!

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:11.740
Stop.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.500
Right here. Right here.

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:14.540
This is where it happened.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:16.620
Kurt come on.
You're really scaring me now.

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.980
Right here. Perfect!

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:21.020
OK.

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.900
Yeah. That's so perfect.

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.100
Alright roll again.

01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:27.860
Roll again.

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:45.818
Fuck. Stop!

01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:46.818
Aaaaaahhhhh

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:49.140
Did you get that?

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:50.618
She's bleeding!

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:51.619
What happened?

01:10:51.621 --> 01:10:52.861
what the fuck happened?

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:54.380
Oh my god, what happened?

01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.338
Kurt, what
happened to her face?

01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:57.940
I'm bleeding, Im bleeding.

01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.836
That was incredible.
A;right come on!

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:00.859
Get out of the way,
We need to get her out of here

01:11:00.861 --> 01:11:02.141
C'mon, c'mon, give me your hand,

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:03.578
give me your hand, c'mon.

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:04.580
Shae, get a towel!

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:12.460
Ow, ow oooww!

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.260
What the fuck
happened up there man?

01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:16.380
I just looked
away for a moment.

01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:21.538
Let me see your face.

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:22.540
Kurt! Look!

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:24.140
It's fucking identical

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:25.700
It's identical

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:28.180
It's the same man.
That's fucked.

01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:29.460
Exactly the same.

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:32.538
I'm done with
your fucking film!

01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:33.658
Hold still. Hold still.

01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:36.018
That's Edmunds fucking mark and
she's not going to die for your movie.

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:37.178
She's going to
finish the fucking film.

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:38.019
It's a movie.

01:11:38.021 --> 01:11:39.700
FUCK your movie!

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:40.979
NO!

01:11:40.981 --> 01:11:42.418
We're finishing the film.

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:44.858
No we cannot finish
the movie with her like that.

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:46.300
Can we please go home?

01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:51.618
No one's gonna die
because of this movie while I'm..

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:53.180
KURT! Look at me!

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.300
Look here!

01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:58.138
You are NOT finishing this
movie with people getting hurt.

01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:59.260
You listen to me.

01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:03.058
What the hell happened up there?

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:04.019
It's exactly the
same as the Journal

01:12:04.021 --> 01:12:05.378
- Did you see what happened?
- No I didn't see.

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:08.380
He's fucking acting really
insane, have you noticed?

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:11.100
Yeah, you have?
You're supposed..

01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:12.660
I don't what to do about it.

01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:34.738
Aww fuck.
He didn't find her.

01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:35.740
Oh…

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:38.498
Have you
looked everywhere?

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.378
Went all the way back.

01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:40.059
OK.OK.

01:12:40.061 --> 01:12:41.098
She doesn't have
a map or anything.

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:42.220
What about the creek?

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:43.940
Shae... go with Grant.

01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:45.498
Maybe you can find her
around the falls.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:46.938
You didn't go all the
way to the creek?

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:47.780
What about …

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:48.699
And shout if
you see anything.

01:12:48.701 --> 01:12:50.138
Kurt, come with me.
We'll go down here.

01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:51.140
Am I..

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:52.419
Am I coming with you?

01:12:52.421 --> 01:12:53.661
No, no Camo, stay here.

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:56.620
Ah, holler if you hear
anything alright man.

01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:57.738
She might come back to camp.

01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:59.500
Yep. Right. Righto. OK.

01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:01.340
Kurt, come on.

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:05.700
Oh, what's that!

01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:12.140
Katie?

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:18.940
Camo!

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:19.980
Katie!

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:21.860
What?

01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:24.180
Fucking hell.

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:29.900
KATIE!

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:32.460
Where are you?

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:42.540
Camo!

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:45.340
Katie don't move,
I'll come find you.

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:50.740
Stay still Katie.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.620
Katie cries out.

01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:57.580
Katie, I can't
understand what youre..

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.780
There's not fucking way
I'm going in there.

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:41.378
Hold it together.
Hold it together.

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:43.380
What the fuck!

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.180
Oh my god. What the fuck?

01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:12.220
Katie I'm coming for you.

01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:18.420
Fuck you!

01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:20.420
This is nothing.

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:22.420
Bring it on!

01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:26.580
Camo!

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:33.380
Katie!

01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:34.740
Oh shit.

01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:42.540
Damnit!

01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:44.060
Everywhere is fucked.

01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:47.820
Katiiiiiiie!

01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:50.060
Help me!

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:56.540
Katie. Just stay still.

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:09.020
Sorry Katie.

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:13.140
Can't fucken do it.

01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.140
Gotta get back.

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:25.500
Which way?

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:27.900
Oh fuck, which way?

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.180
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:36.260
Oh god.

01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:55.100
KATIE!

01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:58.140
GUYS!

01:16:58.780 --> 01:16:59.780
Shit!

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:08.540
Aaaargh!

01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:09.980
Oooooh.

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:16.300
Oh, what the fuck?

01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:17.780
Oh no.

01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:51.220
Katie?

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:53.020
Aaaargh!

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:33.380
It…

01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:35.580
I was..

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:38.940
I was so stressed about
finding an ending to my film.

01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:41.260
I was obsessed with
finding a twist.

01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:46.538
People are always talking
about the endings of films

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:48.220
you know "Oh I didn't
see that coming"

01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:52.060
But the reason they
like it is because…

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:54.780
it's so like life…

01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:56.980
You know.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.980
You never do.

01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:14.940
Oh, it was recording.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:16.220
Hang on.

01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:17.996
- Holy shit!
- What is that?

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:19.940
See what that is.
That's the fucking mark.

01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:21.396
Oh my god, can we please leave?

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:22.820
Can we please get back to camp now?

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:56.780
Katie..
Katie was calling his name.

01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:00.658
What's happened to her?

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:22.738
The church at
Tullochgorum.

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:24.940
Edmund's grave. Uh-huh.

01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:34.980
He isn't going to just
let us do this you know.

01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:37.940
What else are
we going to do?

01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:42.460
He isn't… going to
just let us go home.

01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:54.940
You know with you
there's always been two films.

01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:56.420
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:00.058
The one I want to make and the
one I have to make with you.

01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:01.740
- With me?
- Yeah.

01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:05.700
Gimme the camera.

01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:10.780
I know why you like
this thing so much.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.500
Because when shit
isn't going your way,

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:16.780
when you're having a bad day,

01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:20.098
And you're just out of luck you just
look through your magic

01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:21.340
fucking camera

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:23.580
And then ‘Hey!'
you come out on top.

01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:26.180
Oh, now you get the last word,

01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:28.500
now you get the girl.

01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:31.740
Now you… you're the
fucking film artist,

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.178
the fucking primo artiste right?

01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:36.100
Yeah exactly. The artist.

01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:37.900
That's what burns you
the most isn't it.

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:39.100
Isn't it huh?

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.060
I don't fucking care.

01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:42.940
Film's over.

01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:44.380
We're going home tomorrow.

01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:46.660
Maybe for you.
I'm getting my ending.

01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:49.260
We can't go until
we deal with this.

01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:52.220
You're kidding right?
She's kidding. Are you serious?

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.378
Do you see what is happening?

01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:56.740
you actually believe
in this fucking curse bullshit?

01:21:57.140 --> 01:21:58.380
It's all shit.

01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:04.020
That's it, show's over,
no more film.

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:06.860
This is not the film
where we all die.

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:08.340
Thank you but no.

01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:11.460
- We're leaving in the morning.
- Look around you Brian.

01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:15.338
C'mon Brian.
You're writing the script now.

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:16.340
You've got the next line.

01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:21.020
Shut up Kurt.

01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:28.220
Which one?

01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:31.740
Which one Brian?

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:38.940
Get the fuck
out of my way.

01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:42.340
What's the time?

01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:44.980
I don't know.

01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:49.780
Katie…

01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:56.860
What was that?

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:58.500
Did you hear that?

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:02.500
KATIE!

01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:06.420
KATIE!

01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:16.658
Sounds like she is moving away

01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:17.660
KATIE…

01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:19.100
It's not her.

01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:21.820
What?

01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:23.060
How do you know that?

01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:26.460
KATIE!

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.140
I have to know.

01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:34.900
Katie!

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.500
Katie!

01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:55.018
That's Katie's jacket.

01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:57.700
Sssh.

01:23:59.060 --> 01:24:00.060
Keep going.

01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:01.260
Let's go.

01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:25.300
Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:27.218
Oh shit go!

01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:28.220
Go1

01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:35.659
Kurt!

01:24:35.661 --> 01:24:36.916
Gimme your hand!
Gimme your hand!

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:38.940
Let's go, let's go.

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:40.500
Get up.

01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:41.818
Get the camera!

01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:42.820
The camera!

01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:46.540
Brian get it quick!

01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:49.218
Use the light!
Are you cut?

01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:50.580
- No!
- Are you cut?

01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:52.778
I'm cool, I'm cool,
just give me the camera.

01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:53.780
Please!

01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:55.780
Fuck!

01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:00.340
it's done.

01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:02.060
Let's go. Go! Go!

01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:03.620
Where's Shae?

01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:05.380
Stop, stop, stop.

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:06.820
Stay away from the trees.

01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:09.340
Shae?

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:11.740
Shae?

01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:14.419
Where'd she go?

01:25:14.421 --> 01:25:15.501
Which way did she go? Fuck!

01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:18.820
Shhh.

01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:22.580
SHAE!

01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:27.380
- Let's go.
- Go.

01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:30.780
Oh my god.

01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:33.140
Shae! Wait there!

01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:41.540
Shae!

01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:00.380
You stopped it.

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:19.580
Gotta go. C'mon.

01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:21.140
We should go.

01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:34.460
That tree…

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:37.060
What…

01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:38.860
Yeah…

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.140
What happened…?

01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:51.698
I have no idea.

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:52.700
Let's just go this way.

01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:10.660
Kurt.

01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:13.420
Just stop…

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:15.700
stop…

01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:17.340
filming.

01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:24.140
I'm giving you
what I promised you.

01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:32.460
There isn't a
promise anymore.

01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.380
There's no movie anymore.

01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:39.618
You want to be a star.
You want to be someone.

01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:40.900
I am someone.

01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:43.220
I am someone! I'm Shae!

01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:48.500
Put it down please!

01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:50.980
Put the camera DOWN!

01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:01.060
Please stop that.

01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:24.740
Is that a church?

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:29.500
That's it.

01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:32.380
Lets go.

01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:33.660
Oh, shouldn't we..

01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:36.580
We go. We bury the shit.

01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:37.900
We leave.

01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:38.939
OK.

01:28:38.941 --> 01:28:41.140
Whatever you say
Indiana Jones, let's do this.

01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:18.260
Guys …?

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.020
Who's that?

01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:27.180
What is it?

01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:32.740
Look

01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:36.540
Oh God…

01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:38.900
Look at them all…

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:47.980
What do they want..

01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:50.620
They're his victims.

01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:54.540
Here's your horror movie Kurt.

01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:08.620
Yeah. He's here now.

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:09.940
He's …

01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:14.020
I can feel him, he's …

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:18.178
wants his Beatrice you know and
he was going to walk down

01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:19.820
this aisle with her and…

01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:22.140
and …

01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:25.340
and he thought they were
going to be together forever.

01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:30.980
Maybe there'll be some…

01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:32.940
records., Edmund's
grave or something.

01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:41.260
He's not in there.

01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:43.580
They don't have anything.

01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:46.620
What'll we do?

01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:49.620
Let's find the grave.

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:19.900
What are we going to do?

01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:22.179
We can't just keep looking

01:33:22.181 --> 01:33:23.981
What else are
we gonna do!? We have to…

01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:35.740
Fuck!

01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:37.020
Guys…

01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:38.620
Got it?

01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:40.020
Oh shit…

01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:42.580
Oh!

01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:44.180
Oh wow.

01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:47.100
That'll do.

01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:49.060
Edmund Jan Smuts.

01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:51.260
Let's get it open.

01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:55.980
Get the box!

01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:56.940
I got it.

01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:57.538
Quick.

01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:58.498
Do I get ‘em out?

01:33:58.500 --> 01:33:59.338
- Yeah get them out.
- Put the whole box in.

01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:00.339
The whole thing?

01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:03.740
What the fuck?

01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:10.018
Just dig!

01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:11.020
Let's get these bits.

01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:12.658
Chuck it in Brian.

01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:13.659
Do we aaah..
Say a prayer?

01:34:13.661 --> 01:34:14.938
- Just bury it Brian!
- OK, OK.

01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:15.940
Now!

01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:21.300
OK.

01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:29.020
It's done!

01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:30.980
That's it.

01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:33.740
Burn in hell, ya fucker.

01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:38.340
Shit! Grant!

01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:18.698
didn't fucking work.
It didn't fucking work!

01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:19.658
We must have
done something wrong,

01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:20.579
I don't understand.

01:35:20.581 --> 01:35:22.356
No. We did everything right!
We buried the fucking box.

01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:23.698
This curse is bullshit!

01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:25.498
No it's not.
Course it's not!

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.338
Gladestone knew
what he was doing…

01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:30.058
Shut the fuck up about
Gladestone, Kurt.

01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:34.138
You just stood there and watched
Grant die like a fucking psycho.

01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:35.618
- Fuck you Brian you dont..
- What!

01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:37.060
Wait. Wait.

01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:38.620
Gimme..

01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:39.418
Oh Shit.

01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:40.418
What? What?

01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:41.418
Let go.

01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:42.420
What? What?

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:46.819
Noooooo.

01:35:46.821 --> 01:35:48.500
Shae.
No Shae don't worry that.

01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:50.578
That's too small, that's not it.

01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:51.580
It is, it is…

01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:53.818
Ooooh my god

01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:54.619
Fuck off…

01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:00.140
Come here.

01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:01.900
Come here. Shae. Come here.

01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:04.938
Get the fucking box.
Get the fucking box!

01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:05.938
What?

01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:06.940
Get the box!

01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:09.380
What the fuck?

01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:17.140
Kurt.

01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:20.220
Why are you the only one not cut?

01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:23.778
I don't know.
Gladestone maybe?

01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:24.619
He's protecting me?

01:36:24.621 --> 01:36:26.540
Shut up about
Gladestone Kurt.

01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.300
Did you get this
ring from the box?

01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:35.538
Yeah. It was
Gladestone's. So what?

01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:36.540
OK help me.

01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:39.098
What are
you looking for?

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:40.818
- Give me your ring.
- What?

01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:42.260
Give me your ring. Now!

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:44.300
Oh. Fuck.

01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:46.780
They're the same.

01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:49.500
That..

01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:51.580
That isn't Gladestone's ring.

01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:53.620
It's Beatrice's.

01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:56.140
She was married to Edmund.

01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:57.459
No…

01:36:57.461 --> 01:36:58.860
- Yes!
- No way!

01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:01.260
What do you mean
it's all about me?

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:03.138
You got it wrong OK?

01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:05.578
You thought you were the
last descendant of Gladestone.

01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:07.498
- Yeah, I know I am.
- You're not.

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:09.218
Bullshit! Of course I am.

01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:11.098
All this stuff, all this
stuff is Gladestone's.

01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:13.180
Yes it's Gladestone's
but he isn't the father

01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:14.460
of Beatrice's child.

01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:18.858
What de didn't
want us to find out

01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:21.618
was that Beatrice was pregnant
with Edmund's child

01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:22.636
before he stole here away.

01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:24.658
What about all the
junk in the box then?

01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:25.659
What's that for?

01:37:25.661 --> 01:37:27.898
He had to convince someone that…

01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:29.338
he'd killed the child.

01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:30.698
- Killed his own kid?!
- Edmund's child.

01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:32.578
That's fucking
crazy alright.

01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:34.578
That's insane.
Why would he do that?

01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:35.980
Edmund was cursed.

01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:38.858
EDMUND was cursed.

01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:42.980
"When the blood of Smuts
flows for the last time"

01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:45.420
What do you think
that means Kurt?

01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:46.499
I don't know!

01:37:46.501 --> 01:37:48.340
I.. it doesn't mean anything!

01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:50.140
The blood of
his children!

01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:52.500
His kids. His bloodline.

01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:56.380
His curse was to watch
all his children die

01:37:57.020 --> 01:37:59.300
before he was dragged to hell.

01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:04.220
And then Gladestone shows up
and takes away his unborn child.

01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:05.900
No way.

01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:08.620
You're Edmund's descendant.

01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:09.498
The fuck…

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:10.500
You.

01:38:11.140 --> 01:38:12.738
You're supposed to
be in the grave.

01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:13.740
Not his stuff.

01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:15.060
Kurt.

01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:19.458
You're the only remaining
descendant of Edmund Smuts.

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:20.780
That's why
you're not cut.

01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:22.220
He doesn't want you here.

01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:25.138
He wants you out there making
as many little Edmunds

01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:26.140
as possible.

01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:30.660
It's not true, alright!

01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:31.699
I'm his descendant.
I'm Gladestone's …

01:38:31.701 --> 01:38:34.300
You're not his descendant Kurt.

01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:36.178
I'm his son.
I'm finishing his story.

01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:37.418
Your ancestor
was a killer.

01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:38.419
No alright.

01:38:38.421 --> 01:38:39.658
- NO! Give me the goddam

01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:40.539
fucking camera!

01:38:40.541 --> 01:38:42.940
Brian I'm finishing,
I'm doing..

01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:44.540
Give it back!

01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:47.900
I carried you forever.

01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:49.138
I gave you everything!

01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:50.140
You..

01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:53.460
Had everything!

01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:56.098
You had everything!

01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:57.100
I had nothing!

01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:59.620
I had nothing.
I just wanted one thing!

01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:00.660
I wanted one thing.

01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:02.178
My FUCKING

01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:03.180
FILM!

01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:10.860
Brian!

01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:20.700
Brian?

01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:23.420
Brian?

01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:35.178
Oh?

01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:36.180
Ffffuck!

01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:39.780
No. Hey?

01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.580
Oooh my God!

01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:42.660
Fuck!

01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:45.460
I'm a killer.

01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:47.980
I'M A KILLER, I'm Edmund!

01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:53.980
Fuck!

01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:01.740
God, a fucking killer.

01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:23.060
You're not Edmund Kurt.

01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:30.020
Edmund wants us to go.

01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:32.780
Let's go.

01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:36.820
He wins.

01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.780
Let him rot
in purgatory forever.

01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:49.140
Let's go please.

01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:54.340
What about justice
for his victims huh?

01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:57.980
These wandering souls…

01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:17.580
You're going to be my guardian.

01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:19.140
OK.

01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:25.060
Take the film.

01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:34.260
Ok.

01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:36.220
Rolling.

01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:40.220
Go.

01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:52.060
When I was young,
a long time ago I…

01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:56.020
I grabbed hold of
the tail of a tiger

01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:57.900
and I never let go.

01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:03.018
It spun around and around

01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:04.700
and it went this way

01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:06.380
And that way and

01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:07.700
it came after me

01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:10.580
and I grabbed hold even tighter.

01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:13.940
And it was hungry

01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:17.060
but I wouldn't let go.

01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:23.140
But today I'm going to
let go of that tail.

01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:28.100
Today she gets to eat me.

01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:58.860
The horror.

01:44:01.980 --> 01:44:02.980
The horror.

01:44:09.374 --> 01:44:14.374
