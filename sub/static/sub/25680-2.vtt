21:49.225 --> 21:50.268
I love it.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.895
Thanks, Lil Will.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.980

22:18.254 --> 22:19.756
Aw.

22:21.675 --> 22:22.509
[all] Aw!

22:23.176 --> 22:26.054
Blah, blah, blah, girl stuff.

22:26.179 --> 22:28.223
It's time for...

22:28.306 --> 22:29.641

22:44.989 --> 22:45.865
Oh, great.

22:45.949 --> 22:47.158
He got a podium.

22:48.618 --> 22:49.828
What's it gonna be, Bernard?

22:49.911 --> 22:51.329
Air hockey or pinball?

22:52.497 --> 22:53.915
I'm glad you asked.

22:53.998 --> 22:57.752
This is the moment
you've all been waiting for.

22:57.836 --> 23:01.506
When a decision
transforms an entire house.

23:01.589 --> 23:04.217
I have decided

23:04.300 --> 23:05.593
I'm changing my vote!

23:05.677 --> 23:06.511
[everyone gasps]

23:06.594 --> 23:08.013
Wait, what's happening?

23:09.347 --> 23:11.141
I now vote...

23:11.224 --> 23:12.934

23:13.018 --> 23:14.227
-[gasps]
-Rodney, what are you doing?

23:14.602 --> 23:16.146
I thought we were Team Pinball.

23:16.229 --> 23:17.480
We are.

23:17.564 --> 23:19.315
But I'm also on Team Best Friend Zane.

23:19.399 --> 23:22.736
Maybe you don't know what it's like to
have a best friend.

23:22.819 --> 23:25.321
-Actually, this whole show is about--
-But I do!

23:26.865 --> 23:29.367
And what I want more
than a pinball machine

23:29.451 --> 23:31.536
is for my best friend
to get the air hockey table

23:31.619 --> 23:33.246
he's always wanted.

23:33.329 --> 23:34.664
You heard me?

23:34.748 --> 23:36.332
I did,

23:36.416 --> 23:38.626
with my ears.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.795
Wow!

23:40.879 --> 23:43.173
Man, I don't know what to say.

23:43.256 --> 23:44.883
Whatever it is,

23:44.966 --> 23:46.885
say it with a hug.

23:48.511 --> 23:51.139
Blah, blah, blah, guy stuff.

23:51.222 --> 23:54.225
Who wants to hear The Decider's vote?

23:54.309 --> 23:56.895
I too am changing my vote.

23:56.978 --> 23:58.980
Seriously, what's happening?

24:00.357 --> 24:01.441
Who's with us?

24:01.524 --> 24:02.359
[everyone cheers]

24:03.151 --> 24:04.861
Let's go to the mall and pick out

24:04.944 --> 24:06.821
an air hockey table right now!

24:06.905 --> 24:07.739
[everyone cheers]

24:07.822 --> 24:09.657
Everyone in the Vuuugle Van!

24:09.741 --> 24:10.575
