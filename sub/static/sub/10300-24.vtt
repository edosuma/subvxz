01:26.753 --> 01:29.756
Shamus McBundy,
are you done with me horse?

01:29.957 --> 01:30.991
No, ma'am.

01:31.191 --> 01:34.194
I had to send out for extra
parts to reinforce its feet.

01:35.562 --> 01:39.466
That and a sign to go around
his neck saying, "I'm with fatso."

01:40.601 --> 01:44.505
You save your tongue for picking
the flies off the pools...

01:44.705 --> 01:46.740
...that dance beneath your arms.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.243
Go to. I'm in a hurry.

01:50.177 --> 01:53.480
Is it the festival of pork pies
and pig swallow you're late for?

01:53.680 --> 01:56.416
While you're waiting I've got a plum
pony out back you can snack on.

01:57.384 --> 01:58.519
You been warned.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.854
I am a great and powerful witch.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.624
Not as powerful as yon mighty seams
in yon dress...

02:03.824 --> 02:06.827
...to keep yon belly off yon floor.

02:08.495 --> 02:09.496
That's it.

02:10.030 --> 02:13.066
I curse thee, Shamus McBundy...

02:13.267 --> 02:16.303
...and all thy male descendants.

02:16.503 --> 02:21.408
Henceforth ye shall only shoe
the large and ungrateful.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.477
Yikes! Saveth me!

02:24.978 --> 02:27.314
And so that ye
and all your male descendants...

02:27.514 --> 02:30.250
...will be hated in this place forever...

02:30.450 --> 02:34.354
...Lower Uncton
shall always be in darkness...

02:34.555 --> 02:37.491
...though other towns nearby
stand in sun.

02:37.691 --> 02:41.595
Well, will you be floating above us
blocking the sun?

02:42.663 --> 02:47.100
Just for that, throughout eternity
your feet will sweat.

02:47.301 --> 02:50.204
Aye, and verily smell.

02:57.544 --> 02:59.813
How could yon
blubber belly curse me?

03:00.447 --> 03:02.649
I hurled the unspooning stone
in the big game.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.953
Had I not married,
I wouldst have turned pro.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.523
And so it begins.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.263
Early to be this dark.

03:25.472 --> 03:26.940
This can't be my life.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.442
What am I, cursed?

03:37.117 --> 03:39.686
All right, now.
Ladies and gentlemen...

03:39.887 --> 03:42.189
...we are assembled
for our noon meeting.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.590
Mayor Fivshaw presiding.

03:44.491 --> 03:49.796
As we all know, Lower Uncton has
been in darkness for four centuries...

03:49.997 --> 03:53.433
...and will be so as long
as a male Bundy lives.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.571
I will now call upon
our village historian...

03:57.771 --> 04:00.541
...Mr. Winston McPhee,
to take over the meeting.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.142
Winston?

04:04.344 --> 04:06.346
Right. Now, I don't have to tell you...

04:06.547 --> 04:09.249
...it's been a bloody good year
for killing Bundys.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.753
We've tracked them wherever Bundys
have spread over the centuries.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.589
In fact, they were easy to find
because no matter what the country...

04:15.789 --> 04:20.494
...all we had to was go to the local
shoe store, and there they were.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.363
Now, as you know,
the curse will only be broken...

04:23.564 --> 04:27.134
...if all Bundys are killed
within our town limits.

04:27.334 --> 04:31.038
And whilst this monumental task
has indeed almost broken us...

04:31.238 --> 04:33.040
...I am nevertheless
very happy to announce...

04:33.240 --> 04:36.777
...that there remains only this Bundy...

04:38.478 --> 04:42.416
...and his son,
as the last male Bundys on Earth.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.187
So the curse will be lifted
if we can bring them here...

04:47.387 --> 04:50.691
...and force upon them
an agonizing death.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.763
Now just one question remains:

04:57.397 --> 05:00.267
How do we get them here?

05:01.235 --> 05:04.771
Look, we've just won
a trip to England!

05:04.972 --> 05:06.340
- England?
- Unbelievable.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.809
I know. What's England?

05:10.844 --> 05:11.912
It's a country, Kel.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.348
You know, birthplace of Shakespeare?

05:14.648 --> 05:15.849
Churchill?

05:16.049 --> 05:17.351
Benny Hill?

05:17.551 --> 05:19.753
Oh, yeah. The English guy.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.556
Oh, I love it when he runs fast.
You know, when they go:

05:23.924 --> 05:25.225
Listen.

05:25.926 --> 05:26.927
Listen!

05:27.594 --> 05:31.165
"You have won an all expense
paid trip to London.

05:31.365 --> 05:35.569
Then be driven to a charming
shaded village and stay in a castle."

05:35.769 --> 05:37.437
Where I'll be the guest of honour...

05:37.638 --> 05:40.641
...at a quaint Elizabethan
"expiration ceremony."

05:40.841 --> 05:43.043
- What's that?
- Who cares? It's free.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.379
How did we get so lucky?

05:45.579 --> 05:46.847
Well, it says here...

05:47.047 --> 05:50.150
...that they put all the names
of everyone in the world in a hat...

05:50.350 --> 05:51.585
...and drew ours.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.455
I can't believe this.
It's all expense paid.

05:55.656 --> 05:58.425
I haven't been this happy
since I lived with my parents.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.763
Oh, man. I'm gonna get me
an armful of British babes.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.264
I'll be irresistible.

06:04.464 --> 06:06.667
Because after years of drinking
their warm domestic ale...

06:06.867 --> 06:09.269
...they'll learn that
"Nothing Beats a Bud."

06:14.274 --> 06:16.343
Just remember that
the inflatable women over there...

06:16.543 --> 06:17.945
...blow up on the left side.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.713
- No! No!
- Kids, now, hey!

06:19.913 --> 06:21.515
You got a lot of time to fight.

06:21.715 --> 06:22.850
This is a momentous occasion...

06:23.050 --> 06:25.085
...and I think we should have
a hearty "Whoa, England."

06:25.285 --> 06:27.454
Whoa, England!

06:28.722 --> 06:29.756
Hi.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.259
We're going away for a while
and wanted you to know where...

06:32.459 --> 06:33.961
...since you'd worry and wonder.

06:37.397 --> 06:41.802
Yep, I'm taking Marcie on an expensive
trip to Epcot Center, in Florida.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.670
Gee, Epcot Center in Florida.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.640
Well, that kind of makes
our little trip pale in comparison.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.709
We're going to England.

06:50.611 --> 06:55.082
- Can I get a "Whoa, England"?
- Whoa, England!

06:55.282 --> 06:57.050
Honey, they're "whoa-ing" England.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.820
And you're taking me
to the state of swamps?

07:00.387 --> 07:01.955
I wanna "Whoa, England" too.

07:02.155 --> 07:05.392
You can "whoa" anywhere in
the world, but we're going to Florida.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.794
We were just kidding
about going to Florida.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.863
Jefferson's taking me to England too.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.665
How am I doing that, dear?

07:11.865 --> 07:13.567
I'm selling your car.

07:14.468 --> 07:17.304
Hey, that car was a gift
for sexual favours.

07:18.372 --> 07:21.408
I worked my ass off for that car!

07:24.945 --> 07:27.781
We're going to England!

07:29.283 --> 07:31.852
Oh, boy. We're going to England.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.733
If you dogs mess your cages,
I'm not cleaning it up. Ever!

07:47.401 --> 07:49.803
Hey, I could be a good friend to you.

07:50.003 --> 07:53.774
Tonight, in the flea bath,
a real good friend.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.377
Yep, I'm one lucky dog.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.247
This is your captain speaking.

08:00.447 --> 08:04.251
Will the gentleman in 24B
please put his shoes back on?

08:04.451 --> 08:06.153
I'm choking to death.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.288
- AI.
- Oh, please.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.058
They show us the movie Dutch
and they think I stink?

08:24.371 --> 08:25.706
Take a look around, son.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.508
You won't see this back home.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.676
Dad, it's an airport.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.645
Yeah, but this time we're not dressed
like Hare Krishnas...

08:32.846 --> 08:34.414
...begging for spare change.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.416
Welcome to London.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.652
What's that, honey?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.921
Oh, it's my English-to-English
translation book.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.323
"Welcome to London.
Welcome To London..."

08:43.524 --> 08:46.860
Ten hours on a plane with that man
and those feet.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.129
I can't wait to change.

08:49.329 --> 08:52.032
My clothes smell like corroded toes.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.667
Well, don't blame me.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.237
For 10,000 bucks less we could be
sniffing the sweet feet of Mike Fink...

08:57.437 --> 08:59.473
...on his keelboat ride.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.108
Hey, there's a word I recognize.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.078
That's our name, honey.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.717
Hello, hello. Lovely to see you.
Right. Now, I'm Winston.

09:10.918 --> 09:11.919
I'm your driver, right?

09:12.119 --> 09:13.854
- And this is my assistant driver, Igor.
- Igor?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.055
Yes.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.491
You know perfectly well I had
my name changed legally.

09:17.691 --> 09:20.060
Is it too much trouble
to address me as Merryl?

09:20.327 --> 09:22.896
I'll call you Merryl when we're alone,
all right?

09:23.096 --> 09:25.599
And when was the last time
we were alone?

09:25.799 --> 09:27.467
Not in front of the Yanks.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.303
I'm terribly sorry.
As I was saying...

09:29.503 --> 09:32.840
...we shall be escorting you, but before
we go there's just one little formality.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.775
It's just for the record, really.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.010
Are there any more male Bundys?

09:37.211 --> 09:38.345
Women wish there were.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.049
Not here.

09:42.249 --> 09:46.520
Just remember, they must die
in Lower Uncton and not before.

09:46.687 --> 09:47.754
Got it? Good.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.191
Follow me. Car's outside.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.826
Have a nice journey, did you?
Thank you.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.695
Igor. Okey-dokey.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.096
We're gonna start our tour...

09:56.296 --> 09:59.466
...with an immediate visit to a quaint
little English village, Lower Uncton.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.368
- We don't wanna go there.
- I wanna go London.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.704
London? No, no, no.
Very little to see in London.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.473
Very dirty and it's all quite old too.
No, Lower Uncton.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.743
- Nice car.
- Oh, let's buy one.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.915
They're putting our luggage
into their trunk.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.817
I know. It's all part
of my master plan.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.752
Look, this is a comp trip
for them, right?

10:18.952 --> 10:20.420
All we have to do
is stay close to them.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.590
At the very least we should
get a free limo ride into town.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.594
They left with our luggage!

10:28.028 --> 10:30.397
- Let's get a cab and follow them.
- No, we can't.

10:30.597 --> 10:32.900
I put all our money and
travellers cheques in our baggage.

10:33.100 --> 10:36.737
See, I didn't wanna have
any unsightly bulges in my jacket.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.239
Well, honey, good news.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.742
Soon you won't have any
in your pants either.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.245
Hey! Hey!

10:47.881 --> 10:49.483
That is St. Paul's Cathedral.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.285
Great.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.054
There's Parliament.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.789
Great.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.625
Tower Bridge.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.427
Great.

11:03.597 --> 11:05.032
And that's Trafalgar Square.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.567
Great.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.771
Oh, look. Buckingham Palace.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.339
Great.

11:13.140 --> 11:16.410
- Look, a McDonald's.
- Peg, quick! Get the camera.

11:17.277 --> 11:21.181
I see something else.
Stop the car. Stop the car!

11:25.018 --> 11:28.355
Oh, I smell many women
happily shopping.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.058
This is Harrods.
You really must see it.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.426
You've seen it. Let's go.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.629
I feel somewhat drawn to this place.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.899
Would there be enough in your budget
for me to do a little shopping?

11:39.433 --> 11:41.568
Well, maybe just
a very little shopping.

11:41.735 --> 11:44.037
- We're a very poor village.
- Can we get stuff for us too?

11:44.238 --> 11:45.539
If there's time.

11:55.582 --> 11:58.218
Mom, can we go get
something for us now?

11:58.418 --> 11:59.686
No time.

12:09.363 --> 12:11.165
That's the lot, sir.

12:12.666 --> 12:14.101
Right. Thank you.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.104
Yeah. Money, money.
Send more money.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.672
I've never seen shopping like it.

12:18.872 --> 12:22.142
What? Oh, I don't know.
Just sell something.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.077
For God's sake.

12:25.546 --> 12:27.214
- Well, "Marlboro."
- Winston.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.316
That's much cooler. We're ready.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.251
Lower Uncton?
Shall we go to Lower Uncton now?

12:31.451 --> 12:32.352
Are you kidding?

12:32.553 --> 12:34.354
We wanna see everything,
we wanna do everything.

12:34.555 --> 12:36.490
The Bundys swing
like a pendulum do.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.193
First, take me
to your finest bathroom.

12:49.002 --> 12:52.072
Marcie, can I ride
on the bus now for a while?

12:52.272 --> 12:54.308
No. You've been a bad boy.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.910
Besides, we only had
enough money for one ticket.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.246
Well, then can I stop
at Harrods for a drink of water?

12:59.446 --> 13:00.514
Shut up.

13:00.714 --> 13:02.182
Don't you think I'm thirsty too?

13:02.382 --> 13:04.451
But we have to find the Bundys
and get our luggage back.

13:04.651 --> 13:07.254
- Where did they say they were staying?
- London.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.757
Well, then it's only a matter of time.

13:11.225 --> 13:12.659
Come on.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.361
Quit embarrassing me!

13:14.728 --> 13:16.864
Come on! Come on! Come on!

13:25.138 --> 13:27.774
According to legend,
no one can make the guards smile.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.176
Watch this.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.812
Excuse me, is that a hat...

13:32.012 --> 13:34.948
...or are you just a member
of the British Hair Club for Men?

13:35.582 --> 13:37.384
Let me at him.

13:38.285 --> 13:41.588
My husband sells
women's shoes for a living.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.527
Leave this to me.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.796
I've made men come out of comas.

13:54.735 --> 13:56.170
I'm stupid too.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.140
I'm gonna give it one more try.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.750
That's not a smile.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.386
It will be when I take it away.

14:31.305 --> 14:32.639
- What's this?
- Well...

14:32.840 --> 14:34.842
...Winston says
this is Speakers' Corner.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.810
People come to listen
to just about any idiot...

14:37.010 --> 14:39.513
...spout off about
anything that's bothering him.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.082
I'd like to talk to you today
about women.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.084
I don't like them.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.320
Now, I mean, you folks are English...

14:46.520 --> 14:48.222
...but even you can't like women.

14:48.422 --> 14:51.124
I mean, you're sitting home
watching sports...

14:51.325 --> 14:54.695
...and that's the exact time they pick
to plant their ever-widening...

14:54.895 --> 14:56.597
...what you call "bums,"
next to you...

14:56.797 --> 14:59.700
...and they ask, " Remember that
restaurant we went to 18 years ago?

14:59.900 --> 15:01.902
Did you think
that waitress was pretty?"

15:02.336 --> 15:04.471
Then you tell them to shut up
and they get mad.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.307
Then they cry, then you get mad
because you can't hear the game.

15:07.508 --> 15:10.744
Which I think was their
modus operandi all along.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.881
Now I'm not proposing a solution
because I gotta go soon...

15:14.081 --> 15:15.082
...I see my wife looking.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.950
But I just wanna say...

15:17.151 --> 15:18.619
...I don't like them.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.188
Can I get a hearty,
"Whoa, women. I don't like them"?

15:22.289 --> 15:26.126
Whoa, women! I don't like them!

15:29.062 --> 15:32.566
Oh, by the way, am I alone here
in hating the French?

15:32.766 --> 15:34.067
No!

15:34.835 --> 15:35.936
I thought not.

15:48.549 --> 15:51.385
Any more bright ideas, Mr. A-Little-
Counterfeiting-Never-Hurt-Anyone?

15:51.585 --> 15:52.619
As God is my witness...

15:52.820 --> 15:54.855
...I thought Michael Caine
was on the five-pound note.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.390
It's the queen.

15:56.590 --> 16:00.160
Just our luck, we run into the one guy
who can tell the difference.

16:01.929 --> 16:03.831
Here I am on my dream vacation...

16:04.031 --> 16:07.067
...stuck in an alley, freezing cold,
starving and married to you.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.570
Excuse me...

16:09.770 --> 16:11.505
...but do you remember
that time last winter...

16:11.705 --> 16:14.608
...when I asked you to tape an episode
of Full House and you forgot?

16:14.808 --> 16:16.376
Did I get mad? No.

16:16.577 --> 16:18.912
I just sat there and sulked silently.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.615
But I am hurting inside.

16:22.382 --> 16:23.784
You stink, Marcie.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.054
Don't you push it, Jefferson.

16:27.554 --> 16:28.689
You're not that good in bed.

16:29.456 --> 16:30.991
Oh, come on.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.693
We both know I am.

16:33.694 --> 16:34.828
Now relax, babe.

16:35.028 --> 16:39.366
It's your good fortune to be married
to a criminal and an inveterate liar.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.134
I'll come up with a scheme.

16:41.335 --> 16:43.203
It's gonna have to be very special...

16:43.403 --> 16:46.673
...because the British are a bit more
sophisticated than the Americans.

16:47.808 --> 16:50.010
I got it. It's brilliant.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.520
Come on, take the picture, Bud.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.455
Shoe salesman.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.766
Al, I don't think we can fit
all this stuff in the limo.

17:12.965 --> 17:15.969
Who cares?
We didn't want all this junk anyway.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.875
- Oh, "Lucky Strike."
- Winston. Winston.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.644
- What?
- No need to get snippy.

17:23.844 --> 17:25.979
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Where we going now?

17:26.280 --> 17:28.782
Lower Uncton, that's where.
That's where it's happening, you know?

17:28.982 --> 17:30.918
The birthplace of The Beatles.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.788
- "Camels."
- Winston.

17:34.988 --> 17:35.989
Whatever.

17:36.190 --> 17:37.891
Look, we're tired
of just driving around.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.227
- What is your finest hotel?
- The Savoy.

17:40.394 --> 17:41.895
What Igor really meant to say...

17:42.095 --> 17:46.900
...is it's the fabulous dumpster
by the Ritz in Lower Uncton.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.236
- Didn't you, Igor?
- No, I think they'll like the Savoy.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.271
Anyway, I've never been there
and I want to go.

17:51.471 --> 17:54.408
To the Savoy then,
"Benson & Hedges."

17:54.608 --> 17:55.843
Winston. Winston!

17:56.043 --> 17:59.480
Oh, this is so wonderful.
I hope it never ends.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.215
There they are.

18:01.415 --> 18:04.151
They're staying in London.
They should be easy targets.

18:04.351 --> 18:07.287
Remember, they've got to be killed
outside Lower Uncton.

18:07.488 --> 18:11.925
- The future depends on it.
- Every Upper Uncton schoolboy knows.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.694
If Lower Uncton gets the sun again...

18:13.894 --> 18:17.831
...then Upper Uncton will lose
all its prosperity as a tourist town.

18:18.665 --> 18:22.069
Every year thousands of people come
to our town to view our neighbours.

18:22.269 --> 18:25.973
The village cursed
to inky, hellish darkness.

18:26.707 --> 18:28.242
I know better than anyone.

18:28.442 --> 18:30.577
My father owns
the T-shirt concession.

18:30.744 --> 18:34.281
Remember, they must be killed
outside Lower Uncton...

18:34.481 --> 18:35.749
...or the curse goes on forever.

18:35.949 --> 18:36.950
Don't worry.

18:37.151 --> 18:40.287
The Bundys will never
leave London alive.
