[cell door slams]

01:19.204 --> 01:22.415
[reporter] Disturbing images
out of Litchfield Penitentiary today.

01:22.499 --> 01:25.793
A video has surfaced
of a male corrections officer,

01:25.877 --> 01:29.381
who can be seen
brutally assaulting a female inmate.

01:29.464 --> 01:33.510
Families and supporters are claiming
that this is a clear example

01:33.593 --> 01:36.346
of the abuses the inmates
have been subjected to

01:36.429 --> 01:38.390
since Litchfield became
a private prison...

01:39.182 --> 01:41.226
abuses which have fueled
this three-day standoff...

01:41.309 --> 01:44.229
You know how much splash back
I'm getting from this shit?

01:44.312 --> 01:46.981
My ass is soaked, Nita.
How much longer?

01:47.064 --> 01:49.942
We're at an impasse
with the last few demands.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.279
They're insisting that fair wage
is $10 a day.

01:52.362 --> 01:56.199
You really think I give a shit
about MCC's bottom line?

01:56.283 --> 01:57.867
Look, if we concede,

01:57.950 --> 02:00.120
we will have to do the same
for all New York prisons,

02:00.203 --> 02:01.538
including the ones we run.

02:01.621 --> 02:05.250
And then Whole Foods and Whispers
and every other corporation

02:05.333 --> 02:07.419
will outsource their labor programs
to Jersey.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.461
We can't afford to lose
that kind of business.

02:09.545 --> 02:12.632
What we can't afford is to let this shit
drag out like it's my fucking divorce.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.426
I've got everyone and my mother
calling for this to end.

02:14.509 --> 02:15.885
Literally, my mother called.

02:15.968 --> 02:17.512
So, to be clear,

02:17.595 --> 02:21.516
you are saying that the hostages
are no longer important to you?

02:21.599 --> 02:23.601
No one is saying that.
Just...

02:24.936 --> 02:26.813
Give the inmates what they want.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.732
Let's wrap this up before it goes
to a place we can't recover from.

02:30.358 --> 02:31.693
What's happening out there?

02:31.776 --> 02:35.863
Apparently, a video of CO misconduct
was leaked to the media.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.407
What do you mean?
What misconduct?

02:37.490 --> 02:39.659
I believe it concerns your pet gorilla.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.035
Whatever it is,

02:41.118 --> 02:44.914
it's bad enough that the governor
has agreed to expand the state budget

02:44.997 --> 02:47.209
to accommodate the remaining demands.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.001
So...

02:49.085 --> 02:50.295
we win the riot?

02:50.378 --> 02:54.173
Whatever's under state jurisdiction
to grant, it's yours.

02:54.257 --> 02:57.635
Holy shit!
This worked!

02:57.719 --> 02:59.011
[speaks Spanish]

02:59.095 --> 03:02.724
Uh-uh. Wait a minute.
What ain't in the state's jurisdiction?

03:02.807 --> 03:06.561
The prosecution of CO Bayley
is a separate legal issue.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.271
Like hell it is!

03:08.355 --> 03:11.691
The BOP cannot decide
whether to press charges

03:11.774 --> 03:15.778
-until IA concludes its investigation.
-What's there to investigate?

03:15.862 --> 03:19.574
Three hundred women
saw him crushing Poussey

03:19.657 --> 03:21.326
till her lungs couldn't fill no more.

03:21.409 --> 03:24.704
Then, surely, IA will come
to the same conclusion.

03:24.787 --> 03:27.039
You got to trust the system to do its job.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.125
You mean the same system
who don't give a shit

03:29.208 --> 03:33.255
when some pasty-ass cop shoots a black man
for spray painting a wall?

03:33.338 --> 03:35.632
[stammering] Or selling loose cigarettes?

03:35.715 --> 03:38.218
Or reaching into his pocket
for his own damn keys?

03:38.301 --> 03:41.388
You mean that system?
Oh, yeah, they real trustworthy!

03:41.471 --> 03:43.515
Give us a minute, please.
Give us a minute.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.311
-He can't go free. You understand?
-[sighs]

03:48.395 --> 03:50.062
This whole thing started
because of Poussey!

03:50.146 --> 03:51.606
She the reason we doing this!

03:51.689 --> 03:57.862
And this place will never be what it was
because of what you did for her.

03:57.945 --> 03:59.196
In her name!

03:59.281 --> 04:02.534
If you say no to this now,
it will all be for nothing.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.370
Not to mention,
you are gonna piss off a lot of people.

04:05.453 --> 04:08.706
The women in here...
and the guys out here.

04:08.790 --> 04:12.001
And their weaponry
is a hell of a lot more punishing

04:12.084 --> 04:13.836
than anything a CO wears on his belt.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.797
What you see out there...

04:15.880 --> 04:20.176
is a shit ton of people
who are also angry at you.

04:20.260 --> 04:24.597
We got the public on our side
and hostages! What you got?

04:24.681 --> 04:29.727
A remarkable...
unprecedented offer on the table.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.272
[Taystee] Well, you tell the governor
it ain't good enough.

04:32.355 --> 04:36.025
-[Caputo] Me?
-Yes. You know what happened in here.

04:36.108 --> 04:37.819
You got to tell him.
He'll believe you.

04:37.902 --> 04:40.447
It's not a matter of him
believing me or not.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.531
And?

04:41.614 --> 04:47.787
Mr. Caputo is gonna tell the governor
no hostages until all our demands are met,

04:47.870 --> 04:51.791
especially CO Bayley in jailey.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.042
In jail. Shit!

04:53.125 --> 04:54.877
-Open the doors!
-Taystee, I'm not--

04:54.961 --> 04:56.379
Miss Jefferson...

04:57.464 --> 05:02.719
anything less than a "yes" right now
is the end.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.847
Are you sure you want to blow this?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.851
Yeah. Like, sure-sure?

05:11.227 --> 05:14.522
People who murder people
ain't supposed to just be walking around.

05:14.606 --> 05:18.275
Maybe even walking theyselves
right down to Juarez.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.069
The two of you can come back

05:20.152 --> 05:23.573
when you're ready
to give us justice for Poussey!

05:23.656 --> 05:24.782
Get the fuck out!

05:27.577 --> 05:29.078
[door opens]

05:29.161 --> 05:31.414
-Taystee...
-Get the fuck out.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.625
[sighs]

05:37.003 --> 05:38.671
[camera shutters clicking]

05:39.672 --> 05:41.883
[reporters clamoring]

05:47.096 --> 05:50.517
[breathing heavily] I'm sorry, um,
I need to tell you...

05:50.600 --> 05:52.226
I'm having a panic attack.

05:54.353 --> 05:55.647
Okay. Uh...

05:56.606 --> 05:58.107
Can I... can I do something?

05:58.190 --> 06:00.192
Actually, can you hold her for a sec?

06:01.193 --> 06:03.029
-Oh...
-Okay.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.117
[baby cooing]

06:09.869 --> 06:11.078
[softly] Okay.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.666
-It's okay.
-[continues cooing]

06:14.749 --> 06:16.668
Everything's gonna be all right.

06:16.751 --> 06:20.087
[breathing heavily] I know, right?
I know everything's gonna be all right.

06:22.549 --> 06:26.343
Okay, can you...
can you die from these?

06:26.428 --> 06:29.096
Like, do you think anyone's ever
panicked themselves to death?

06:29.180 --> 06:34.602
My mom told me to think of the beach,
but... some thoughts are too dark.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.229
Okay, that doesn't help.

06:38.397 --> 06:39.941
Also, you're, like, what... 12?

06:41.192 --> 06:42.652
What do you know about dark thoughts?

06:43.319 --> 06:44.654
I killed someone.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.827
She's dead.

06:52.995 --> 06:55.372
Yeah, I'm feeling better now.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.333
Yeah, I'll take her back.
Thank you, please.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.545
[shushes]

07:00.628 --> 07:02.964
[softly] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

07:09.178 --> 07:12.306
Guys, we're up to 600,000 views
on YouTube.

07:12.389 --> 07:14.100
-But what are they saying?
-Uh, uh, uh...

07:14.183 --> 07:16.393
The comments are mostly skewing positive.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.354
"Squash the system."
"Give the ladies what they want."

07:18.438 --> 07:19.814
That sort of thing.

07:19.897 --> 07:24.068
I guess you can't deny cruelty
when it shows up on your Facebook feed.

07:24.151 --> 07:25.612
We must beware of the goblins.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.739
-The goblins?
-She means trolls.

07:27.822 --> 07:31.158
-Right, of course.
-Yes. He's a big goblin-troll.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.869
And the others like him in the webiverse

07:32.952 --> 07:36.247
could still find a way
to defend him and vilify us.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.958
And we can't let that happen.
We must stay on top.

07:39.041 --> 07:42.712
Red, I think it is time for you
to sit down and just chill the fuck out!

07:42.795 --> 07:44.046
[speaks Spanish]

07:44.130 --> 07:45.923
Can we all chill the fuck out?

07:46.007 --> 07:49.218
-Refresh the feed, Gina.
-[Nicky] Oh, for fuck's sake...

07:49.301 --> 07:51.846
Will you just promise me
that you will take it easy?

07:51.929 --> 07:53.264
Easy does it.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.518
I gotta get some air. Huh?

07:58.102 --> 08:00.938
WebMD said to elevate it above your heart.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.650
It also said to seek
professional medical care.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.527
Dr. Chapman is here.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.613
And I am gonna scrounge together

08:08.696 --> 08:11.783
the finest cocktail
that Litchfield has to offer.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.744
I already got some Tylenol
from Arsenic and Old Lace over there.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.120
It probably expired in '98.

08:16.203 --> 08:20.207
Expiration dates are a marketing scheme.
Totally bogus.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.459
All right. I'm gonna go to the pharmacy.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.003
I'll see if I can get you
something harder.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.213
Wait, you're actually considering
going back out there?

08:26.297 --> 08:28.007
-For you.
-[scoffs] For me?

08:28.633 --> 08:30.677
Please, don't do your thing right now.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.011
Are you talking about
my trying-to-help-you thing?

08:33.095 --> 08:35.932
Or are you talking about
my speaking-in-general thing?

08:36.015 --> 08:39.101
Why can't you just say
you want to see what's going on?

08:39.184 --> 08:40.852
Fine. I do.

08:40.937 --> 08:45.024
I wanna go see if all this is ending
so that I can get you some real help.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.821
And I also wanna see if all this stuff
we've done has been for nothing.

08:49.904 --> 08:53.157
You wanna know if me
getting my ulna snapped by Godzilla

08:53.240 --> 08:54.491
helped your little cause?

08:54.576 --> 08:58.204
Alex... I know that you're hurting.

09:02.124 --> 09:03.334
What he did...

09:05.628 --> 09:10.800
I wanted to die... just sitting there,
not being able to help you.

09:16.513 --> 09:20.184
Which is why I think it's very important
for me to go find out--

09:20.267 --> 09:22.687
-You know what? Go. Just go.
-No.

09:22.770 --> 09:25.064
-If you want me to stay, I'll stay.
-[softly] What is it?

09:25.147 --> 09:26.691
-I'm serious...
-I'm--

09:26.774 --> 09:31.528
Go. I actually... I actually don't
even want to look at you right now.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.366
Go!

09:43.874 --> 09:45.918
[needle buzzing]

09:47.544 --> 09:51.090
[Piper] It represents magic.
And beauty.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.718
And appreciating beauty.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.929
So why did you decide to get it in a spot
where you can't see it?

09:57.013 --> 09:59.515
Oh, it's not for me.
It's for other people.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.226
Other people who fail to see the beauty

10:02.309 --> 10:05.271
even when they are
in the most beautiful place on earth,

10:05.354 --> 10:07.356
looking at a magic fish up close,

10:07.439 --> 10:09.692
just because they got a little seasick
on the way back to shore.

10:09.776 --> 10:13.613
And believe me, I get that it's no fun
to barf on sea life,

10:13.696 --> 10:16.866
but you drink some water,
you take a nap and you move on.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.451
You don't sit inside for two days and mope

10:19.535 --> 10:22.079
when the beach and...

10:22.163 --> 10:24.165
life and...

10:24.248 --> 10:26.042
sun is all happening outside. You know?

10:26.125 --> 10:27.584
Sounds like trouble in paradise.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.921
Well, it's trouble in paradise.
It's trouble in New York.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.172
And it's trouble in Europe.

10:31.881 --> 10:35.259
-Maybe you're incompatible.
-Oh, we're completely incompatible.

10:35.342 --> 10:37.845
We don't work at all.
The entire thing is stupid.

10:37.929 --> 10:41.057
But yet you're here
getting a fish tattoo on your neck

10:41.140 --> 10:42.892
-to remind her of beauty.
-Mmm-hmm.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.562
Because I love her.

10:49.023 --> 10:52.526
She can't reject the deal.
Did you explain our legal limitations?

10:52.609 --> 10:53.903
This is not about logic.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.404
Give me that.

10:55.487 --> 10:59.283
-You got some crackers or something?
-I'll see what I can find.

10:59.366 --> 11:01.452
You're going to need to tell me
where the hostages are,

11:01.535 --> 11:03.370
so we can avoid them in the cross fire.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.957
-No! You can't go in there.
-[scoffs]

11:06.040 --> 11:08.876
You tell Jack some of us
also value inmate lives.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.963
Well, actually, MCC is out of the picture
for the time being.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.464
Oh, for the time being?

11:13.547 --> 11:15.674
You're really going to let them
keep their license after all this?

11:15.758 --> 11:19.345
[scoffs] I wouldn't be so quick
to assign blame yet, Warden.

11:20.429 --> 11:23.682
Listen to me.
You don't have to do this.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.728
One inmate does not speak
for the entire prison.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.146
There are... there are other leaders
that I can talk to. I--

11:29.230 --> 11:32.817
We gave them everything they wanted
and it still wasn't enough.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.195
It's like when you offer
a homeless man a bagel

11:36.278 --> 11:39.782
and then he asks you
for a veggie schmear and jam.

11:39.866 --> 11:43.577
Just because a homeless man
is into weird food combinations

11:43.660 --> 11:45.287
doesn't mean he's not hungry.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.875
That man didn't want food
any more than those women want reform.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.667
They want to remain victims.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.337
If you actually give them what they want,
they lose their power.

11:53.420 --> 11:56.632
Are those... the hostages?

11:56.715 --> 11:58.134
Jefferson let them out?

11:59.135 --> 12:00.552
She must've changed her mind.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.346
[Nita] Bring them in here.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.390
I don't want anybody
seeing them until we've had time

12:04.473 --> 12:06.058
-to prepare a statement.
-[man] Yes, ma'am.

12:08.685 --> 12:11.898
-I guess we make an okay team.
-Don't even think about hugging me.

12:13.565 --> 12:14.608
Come here.

12:16.360 --> 12:20.572
It's like you stepped in dog shit
with your whole body. [grunts]

12:20.656 --> 12:22.116
You love it.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.327
You would've done the same thing as me,
and you know it.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.246
He's coming out of surgery.
Please...

12:27.329 --> 12:30.082
[Pidge] Oh, shut it.
You're giving me a headache.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.709
We arresting OGs now?
Dang!

12:32.794 --> 12:35.337
[in Spanish] Backstabbing bitch
released all our guards.

12:36.338 --> 12:37.882
[in English]
This piece of shit's all we got left.

12:37.965 --> 12:40.634
You could have said that last part in...
in Spanish.

12:40.717 --> 12:43.554
-Help me frisk 'em.
-Don't got to tell me twice.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.849
[Gloria] No, come on. Please, don't.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.685
No, no, no. You can't take that.
Please, no.

12:49.768 --> 12:50.895
I need to know about my boy.

12:50.978 --> 12:54.231
Please, if you have any humanity in you,
please don't do this.

12:54.315 --> 12:58.360
We could've gotten our GEDs in here,
instead of wasting our time. [scoffs]

12:58.444 --> 13:00.279
We could've gotten it so that our kids

13:00.362 --> 13:02.990
could hug us for more than 30 seconds
when they come see us.

13:03.074 --> 13:06.452
But you just screwed all of us
out of that.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.662
So don't talk to me about humanity.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.920
[Ouija breathing heavily]
Keep an eye on them tricky fuckers.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.546
And no torturing till we get back.

13:17.629 --> 13:20.591
Wait. [sighs]
Where we going?

13:20.674 --> 13:23.052
We... we got to tell La Jefferson
what happened.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.888
I think I need to make a pit stop first.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.933
Starting to think maybe we
shouldn't have snorted all that coffee.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.642
Coffee has been proven
to give you the shits.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.769
Something about bowel spasms.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.730
Bet you feel better
after you push some brown out.

13:34.813 --> 13:36.232
[Ouija exclaims] Jeez!

13:36.315 --> 13:39.068
-[inmates muttering]
-Fuck! Wrong end!

13:39.151 --> 13:41.528
Come on... [stammers]
let's get you to a bathroom, mama.

13:41.612 --> 13:42.821
-Come on.
-[Pidge weakly] Okay.

14:02.799 --> 14:06.220
So... this whole time,
I've been your muscle...

14:07.263 --> 14:09.848
while you've been trying to figure out
a way to free your boyfriend?

14:09.932 --> 14:13.144
No. Fuck Joe.
He cheated on me.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.313
And I'm, like, way above his pay grade.

14:16.397 --> 14:19.275
I mean, I... I thought that he
was headed up MCC's corporate ladder,

14:19.358 --> 14:21.652
but clearly, the man
simply does not have what it takes.

14:22.569 --> 14:25.114
And if I'm going to be perfectly honest...

14:25.948 --> 14:29.576
there is such a thing as too big,
you know?

14:29.660 --> 14:30.870
I'm kind of tight down there, so...

14:31.620 --> 14:36.125
-Your poor, counterfeit cunt.
-I'm sorry, Boo. I am.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.459
But I was too afraid to tell you.

14:39.253 --> 14:42.173
You know that there were
parts of Von Barlow that were real,

14:42.256 --> 14:43.549
that were me.

14:45.342 --> 14:49.138
You know, I... I don't have a problem
with the cunt you created.

14:49.221 --> 14:53.184
My problem is with the cunt you are.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.936
The MCC cunt.

14:55.019 --> 14:59.941
The one who every day, in every way,
makes this shithole a whole lot shittier.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.317
I didn't know.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.111
But now that I'm in here,
I realize how fucked up it is

15:04.195 --> 15:05.612
to treat people like...

15:06.613 --> 15:08.824
like variables
affecting our net income gains.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.036
But I see you now.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.914
And you deserve more
than the bare minimum needed to survive.

15:14.997 --> 15:18.709
Yeah. We deserve more. [scoffs]

15:19.376 --> 15:20.502
In fact...

15:21.170 --> 15:27.759
I think that I, personally,
deserve about $5000 more.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.805
You know...

15:32.556 --> 15:34.058
to keep your little secret?

15:35.809 --> 15:37.228
That's extortion.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.313
[scoffs] I'm sorry.

15:39.396 --> 15:41.857
Do you think I was in here
because I made an honest living?

15:44.026 --> 15:45.069
Fine.

15:46.403 --> 15:47.613
Glad that's settled.

15:48.655 --> 15:50.199
What?

15:50.282 --> 15:54.203
[chuckles] Oh...
You're gonna PayPal me, pronto.

15:55.246 --> 15:58.415
booboombah@hotmail.com.

15:59.750 --> 16:05.506
Well, it looks like I am down to 3%,
and I did not bring my charger. So...

16:06.632 --> 16:09.551
So... let's go looking.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.388
Fine.

16:13.389 --> 16:18.560
-Hey, nurse? You still open?
-Do you really wanna keep playing that?

16:18.644 --> 16:21.272
-What happened to you?
-Uh...

16:21.355 --> 16:23.149
I got mauled by a bear.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.994
-You take some of Red's vitamins?
-Oh, I wish.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.954
Any drugs of any kind
would have really helped

16:38.039 --> 16:40.916
with the tsunami of fucked-up
that was last night.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.461
But, sadly... still sober.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.714
You gonna tell me what happened,
or you... you gonna keep stalling

16:47.798 --> 16:49.383
with all your words?

16:49.466 --> 16:51.802
Uh, for now,
I don't want to talk about it.

16:51.885 --> 16:53.304
You know,
I don't wanna think about it.

16:53.387 --> 16:57.516
All I want to do is just sit here,
you know, with you.

16:58.850 --> 17:01.270
Maybe see about a cigarette.
They keep any fucking cigarettes here?

17:01.353 --> 17:03.480
-No. Hey, hey, hey.
-What?

17:04.397 --> 17:05.982
You're not mad at me anymore?

17:06.067 --> 17:10.112
Look, it turns out that mad is a luxury
I cannot afford at this time.

17:10.779 --> 17:13.031
There is a reason
why those Spanish ladies,

17:13.115 --> 17:15.242
they call me loco in the coco.

17:15.326 --> 17:19.579
I'm trying so hard not to be like that.

17:19.663 --> 17:24.042
But it's like, uh, what Dr. Oz
says about insanity.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.046
When you do the same thing
over, over, over, over again,

17:27.128 --> 17:28.589
expecting different results.

17:28.672 --> 17:32.134
Well, I think it was actually Einstein,
but proceed.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.471
[grunts softly]

17:37.306 --> 17:38.349
[grunts]

17:39.308 --> 17:40.809
See, they look positive to me.

17:40.892 --> 17:43.979
I mean, I know some of the lines
is blurrier than the others,

17:44.063 --> 17:48.067
but I think I'm so fucking crazy,
I'm seeing shit now.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.235
Babe...

17:51.195 --> 17:52.363
you're actually pregnant.

17:53.114 --> 17:55.616
I mean, you're also crazy, but, uh,

17:55.699 --> 17:57.326
unless you put these
in someone else's piss...

17:57.409 --> 17:59.286
-No, I did not.
-Well...

17:59.370 --> 18:01.247
okay, you're with child here.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.999
[gasps] No. No, that's not...

18:04.083 --> 18:07.043
that's not... possible, because you said--

18:07.128 --> 18:09.380
I didn't believe you.
All right, maybe I was scared,

18:09.463 --> 18:12.258
you know, imagining a hairy little bambino
popping out of your vajayjay.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.385
It's not exactly the stuff
of masturbatory fantasies.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.636
But, uh...

18:16.970 --> 18:18.722
Hey, I'm happy for you.

18:18.805 --> 18:20.391
This is what you always wanted, right?

18:20.474 --> 18:21.600
Vinnie...

18:22.643 --> 18:24.853
Vinnie doesn't want
to have anything to do with this.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.606
He won't even answer my calls.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.275
Fuck Vinnie.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.152
All right? We'll make it work.
I will help you.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.487
What about this baby? Huh?

18:34.696 --> 18:38.325
For a whole year, I'm not gonna be there
to watch his little belly at night,

18:38.409 --> 18:40.202
make sure he's still breathing.

18:40.286 --> 18:43.205
Remember to wash
the little folds in his neck.

18:43.289 --> 18:46.708
Take those cute photos of him
with a big bowl of spaghetti,

18:46.792 --> 18:49.295
with a meatball
on top of his head and... and...

18:49.378 --> 18:53.257
Now his father's not gonna be there
to do those things, either.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.633
Oh, my God!

18:54.716 --> 18:58.011
Nicky, what kind of a life
is that for a baby?

18:58.094 --> 19:00.847
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[kisses] Stop. Breathe.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.099
It'll be fine, okay?

19:03.184 --> 19:05.602
Look, babies don't know shit.

19:05.686 --> 19:06.978
-[sighs]
-They're babies.

19:07.062 --> 19:09.022
-[groans]
-Come here.

19:10.524 --> 19:13.277
We will let your families know
you've been safely released.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.279
-Mine, too?
-That's right.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.405
[sighs and chuckles]

19:16.488 --> 19:19.616
Um... she's an inmate, actually. So...

19:21.577 --> 19:24.996
What did Jefferson say when she sent you?
I want her exact words.

19:25.080 --> 19:29.084
Jefferson? Oh, no, no, no.
This was all me.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.588
I risked my ass like Moses,
leading these people to freedom.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.591
Yeah. She cut a hole in the fence.

19:35.674 --> 19:40.262
Are you saying the hostages weren't
released as a result of negotiations?

19:40.346 --> 19:43.139
Negotiations? No, no, no, no, no.
I did it for the deal.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.141
What deal?
From whom?

19:47.644 --> 19:49.188
With the guys.
They, um...

19:50.939 --> 19:53.609
The ones that run the prison. You know?
[stammering] The MCC.

19:53.692 --> 19:59.365
They... they said that I would get time
off my sentence if I freed them.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.577
I am so sorry if anyone from MCC

20:03.660 --> 20:06.288
led you to believe that they
have a say in inmate sentencing--

20:06.372 --> 20:08.332
No, no, no. Uh-uh.
No. Fuck that.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.251
No. You see...

20:11.835 --> 20:15.381
I ruined a lot of things
for a lot of good people in there,

20:15.464 --> 20:17.591
and I didn't do this shit for nothing.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.092
Uh, oh, okay.

20:19.175 --> 20:21.762
Don't get me wrong. We are
extremely grateful for what you've done.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.555
I just want to go home.

20:25.974 --> 20:30.145
You know, I ain't never
put my baby girl to sleep before?

20:31.772 --> 20:34.400
Not even once. [sobbing]

20:36.693 --> 20:39.655
I risked everything
to get these people out.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.366
Your people.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.661
I will see what I can do for you.

20:47.078 --> 20:48.121
[breath trembling] Thank you.

20:48.914 --> 20:52.293
This is a nice, snug fit.

20:53.209 --> 20:56.422
Perfect for my CPAP. [sighs]

20:57.839 --> 21:00.717
I wonder how long it'll take 'em
to wrap this all up.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.679
Hadn't really planned on so many...

21:04.596 --> 21:05.722
visitors.

21:05.806 --> 21:08.392
I've been called much worse
and stayed much longer.

21:09.142 --> 21:11.437
Oh, Frieda.
Look at us!

21:12.646 --> 21:16.733
He was so sure he had the win.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.319
Fool.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.820
[Frieda chuckles] Don't "us" me.

21:19.903 --> 21:23.407
I helped you out,
but the game I play is defense.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.992
-What happens to him outside--
-[Red] Outside?

21:28.495 --> 21:29.621
No.

21:31.665 --> 21:34.751
I can't let them take him out
without a victory lap.

21:35.419 --> 21:39.089
Them taking him out
is your victory lap, Red.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.174
He'll be prosecuted.

21:42.008 --> 21:45.220
-When is it enough for you?
-Almost.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.724
It's almost enough.

21:49.766 --> 21:51.059
Gina, give me the phone.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.188
Didn't you promise Nichols
you'd stay on the straight and narrow?

21:55.271 --> 21:58.233
Without disappointment,
she and I have nothing.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.404
Oh...

22:04.531 --> 22:06.492
One less Pabst.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.077
Mark it, Norma.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.122
You could ask for help.

22:12.205 --> 22:15.626
Why? Do you have some magical yoga poses
that will help me?

22:15.709 --> 22:20.046
Those tend to work better
when your bones are intact.

22:21.047 --> 22:22.257
Mmm. [sighs]

22:24.259 --> 22:26.094
Why'd you tell Chapman to go?

22:27.303 --> 22:28.722
Because she didn't want to stay.

22:31.224 --> 22:36.146
Piper always needs to have a cause.
Or some other escape hatch.

22:36.229 --> 22:39.065
Seemed to me like she wanted to help you.

22:39.983 --> 22:42.944
At least from where I was standing,
which wasn't very close.

22:43.028 --> 22:47.157
But, you know, it's pretty tight,
so it wasn't so far, either.

22:48.575 --> 22:52.663
Look, she leaves.
It's what she does. Trust me.

22:54.456 --> 22:57.709
These past few days,
we could've hung out together,

22:58.627 --> 22:59.753
playing house...

23:00.671 --> 23:03.507
taking advantage of the only moments
of relative freedom

23:03.590 --> 23:05.426
that we're gonna have for years.

23:07.052 --> 23:09.805
But, instead,
she had to go do something else.

23:10.681 --> 23:11.973
All I'm saying...

23:13.016 --> 23:17.729
is you can't tell people to go
and then blame them for leaving.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.992
[man] "Love is pain."

23:31.076 --> 23:32.410
Excuse me?

23:33.829 --> 23:35.789
Uh, your arm. Your...

23:35.872 --> 23:37.916
-how you say, uh... inking?
-Oh.

23:37.999 --> 23:40.210
This? I got this as a joke.

23:42.087 --> 23:47.509
My girlfriend got a fish that was
supposed to remind me of beauty...

23:48.510 --> 23:52.931
and, in response, I did this.
Like, "I'll show you."

23:53.014 --> 23:55.058
Love is not beauty.

23:55.141 --> 23:57.227
-It's pain.
-Mmm...

23:57.310 --> 23:58.436
Girlfriend?

24:00.063 --> 24:01.523
Well, she's my ex-girlfriend.

24:02.107 --> 24:06.402
Oh, I'm all gay, all the time,
so I'll never fuck you, Frenchy.

24:07.779 --> 24:10.156
Still want to ask about my inking?

24:10.240 --> 24:12.325
-Sure. Why not?
-[sighs]

24:12.408 --> 24:15.078
I like stories.
Helps me forget my own love pain.

24:15.161 --> 24:17.122
Mmm. Mademoiselle!

24:18.289 --> 24:19.708
-[clears throat]
-Same again?

24:19.791 --> 24:22.503
-Yes. And whatever she's having.
-You got it.

24:24.880 --> 24:28.675
I bet... [clears throat]
my love pain beats your love pain.

24:28.759 --> 24:30.468
[chuckles]

24:30.552 --> 24:33.138
-Pain is not a contest.
-Mmm.

24:35.056 --> 24:36.683
[sighs] She broke my heart.

24:38.351 --> 24:39.394
Mon cœur.

24:40.771 --> 24:43.649
And that happens. I get it.
I mean, you know, like...

24:45.526 --> 24:46.527
whatever.

24:46.610 --> 24:50.864
You know, like, people that love
each other hurt each other.

24:50.947 --> 24:55.076
But... today, I really went nuclear.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.329
I think I broke her life.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.207
What did you do?

25:03.376 --> 25:04.586
Thank you.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.757
I'm sorry. That's... that's
about as specific as it's gonna get.

25:08.840 --> 25:12.302
Uh, I think you actually
want to tell someone.

25:13.261 --> 25:15.263
Here, I will go first.
Okay.

25:15.931 --> 25:20.268
My wife, she made sex
with our local butcher.

25:20.351 --> 25:23.521
-So I made sex with a stewardess.
-[scoffs]

25:23.605 --> 25:27.108
And then she made sex
with a landscape architect,

25:27.192 --> 25:29.527
and I made sex with a history teacher,

25:29.611 --> 25:33.031
and a jazz singer, and a secretary
and a waitress.

25:33.114 --> 25:36.242
No... two waitresses.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.371
-And now, I am alone...
-Mmm.

25:40.455 --> 25:44.334
...and she is marrying
the landscape architect.

25:44.417 --> 25:46.169
-[grunts] Aw.
-[chuckles]

25:46.252 --> 25:50.924
And I am sharing my story of pain

25:51.842 --> 25:54.720
with a lesbian in a bar in New York.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.723
See? Easy.

25:58.890 --> 25:59.933
Now you.

26:03.729 --> 26:04.855
I said her name.

26:08.692 --> 26:12.696
And they said, "Would you spell that?"

26:14.030 --> 26:15.406
And then they asked...

26:16.658 --> 26:20.203
"This person,
was she aware of her crimes?"

26:21.246 --> 26:23.832
And then they said her name back to me.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.917
And then I said her name back to them.

26:27.836 --> 26:32.132
I spent the afternoon
sending the love of my life to prison...

26:32.215 --> 26:33.549
to save myself.

26:35.719 --> 26:37.721
Because, after six years...

26:39.014 --> 26:40.766
I'm still mad at her.

26:41.432 --> 26:42.684
And hurt by her.

26:45.311 --> 26:47.230
And I still love her. And...

26:48.148 --> 26:49.816
love is pain.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.360
-Merde.
-[sips]

26:56.114 --> 26:57.198
See?

26:58.241 --> 26:59.325
I win.

27:00.744 --> 27:01.953
Another drink?

27:07.668 --> 27:09.002
[rattling]

27:25.101 --> 27:26.102
Ugh.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.938
-[door creaks]
-[groans softly]

27:29.189 --> 27:30.315
[sighs]

27:52.963 --> 27:54.089
[Red] You're awake.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.682
Mmm...

28:04.766 --> 28:08.186
Even warm beer tastes good after a win.

28:09.896 --> 28:14.109
Look, we just broke a million views!

28:15.276 --> 28:20.741
A million people have seen what
a pathetic, abusive little man you are.

28:24.327 --> 28:27.914
Your hand could fit twice
around that girl's arm.

28:27.998 --> 28:31.835
Yet you still needed to break it
to hold her back.

28:31.918 --> 28:35.546
You really think anyone's
gonna give a shit about that in a day?

28:35.630 --> 28:38.925
Some 12-year-old's
gonna add a fart noise to it,

28:39.009 --> 28:41.177
share it with his
fart-noise-loving buddies,

28:41.261 --> 28:44.014
then a new fart noise video's
gonna come out,

28:44.097 --> 28:47.350
and you will all be forgotten.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.269
Again.

28:49.352 --> 28:51.772
This is pretty compelling stuff.

28:52.856 --> 28:56.109
Sticky.
I think it's gonna stick.

28:56.192 --> 28:59.695
I think that you are
the scum of the earth.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.741
You're as much a criminal as we are.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.868
-You just haven't been caught yet.
-[coughs]

29:04.951 --> 29:06.036
But it's coming.

29:06.995 --> 29:11.082
Because we won.
We fought back and we won.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.044
-And you are a blind cow.
-[coughs]

29:14.127 --> 29:17.005
And you are a... [coughing]

29:25.555 --> 29:26.722
[grunting]

29:26.807 --> 29:27.808
[spits]

29:28.558 --> 29:30.268
[breathing heavily]

29:36.316 --> 29:40.403
I lost my humanity
in the dirt here for a while...

29:42.613 --> 29:44.657
but it's slowly coming back.

29:46.326 --> 29:49.996
See how I tried to do the human thing
and give a man a drink?

29:51.832 --> 29:53.666
But you can't take it.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.213
In addition to not seeing yourself...

29:59.923 --> 30:01.757
you can't see me.

30:03.885 --> 30:06.888
And we have so much in common.

30:06.972 --> 30:10.433
We have nothing in common.

30:12.102 --> 30:14.980
You're a prisoner, and I'm free.

30:15.063 --> 30:20.318
And the likelihood that ever changes
is something I'd bet my life on.

30:21.777 --> 30:23.529
I'd take that bet.

30:29.119 --> 30:31.621
-[inmates clamoring]
-I told you they ain't coming back.

30:31.704 --> 30:33.999
Look, they just...
they sweating us out is all.

30:35.541 --> 30:38.086
Hey. What happened to Kramer vs. Kramer?

30:38.169 --> 30:41.131
-They'll be right back.
-Back? From where?

30:41.214 --> 30:42.841
We got everything,

30:42.924 --> 30:45.551
-but then she kicked them out--
-Almost everything.

30:45.635 --> 30:49.555
And now they're gonna tell the governor
that we need to get Bayley back, too.

30:49.639 --> 30:52.893
You mean Figueroa gave in
on everything else on the list?

30:52.976 --> 30:56.354
Look, none of that matters
if we don't get what we came for.

30:56.437 --> 30:58.439
A lot of us care about those other things.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.608
-Yeah.
-Oh, so now y'all wanna give a shit?

31:00.691 --> 31:02.235
Yo, y'all need to chill.

31:02.318 --> 31:04.487
If T say they're coming back,
they're coming back.

31:04.570 --> 31:07.240
But how much longer can we afford to wait?

31:07.323 --> 31:08.616
What about Suzanne?

31:08.699 --> 31:11.912
Wait, I told Cindy
to deal with her ass already.

31:11.995 --> 31:15.790
Oh, you the one that sent "Shalom, y'all"
to give Suzanne lithium?

31:15.874 --> 31:17.083
Lithium?

31:17.167 --> 31:19.377
What else were we supposed to do?

31:19.460 --> 31:21.629
Crazy is scary when she crazy-crazy.

31:21.712 --> 31:24.424
She needed to shut the fuck up
for a little while.

31:24.507 --> 31:28.011
Well, now she's catatonic,
so I hope you're all happy.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.512
Jesus!

31:29.595 --> 31:31.764
One of y'all come and get me
when they come back.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.851
When they come back? [scoffs]

31:37.937 --> 31:39.606
[doorbell rings]

31:43.859 --> 31:46.029
-How much I owe you?
-What?

31:48.698 --> 31:49.782
Where's the food?

31:51.784 --> 31:53.036
You from Greco's?

31:55.621 --> 31:57.082
I'm here about Poussey.

32:00.126 --> 32:01.336
You're a friend of hers?

32:02.295 --> 32:04.172
I'm from Litchfield.

32:05.590 --> 32:09.219
I work there.
[stammering] I mean, I used to work there.

32:11.096 --> 32:12.222
You're the CO.

32:13.889 --> 32:15.766
Baxter. Bayley, sir.

32:16.351 --> 32:17.643
What the hell are you doing here?

32:17.727 --> 32:21.105
-Sir, I'm... I'm so sorry. I--
-Get away from me!

32:21.397 --> 32:23.441
Get away from my house.

32:23.524 --> 32:26.027
You got about two seconds
to get off my property.

32:26.111 --> 32:30.615
[stammering] Wait, I wanted to tell you
that... that I'm-- I'm sorry.

32:31.657 --> 32:35.245
What am I gonna do with that?
You want me to say I forgive you?

32:35.328 --> 32:38.039
I just wanted to tell you
that I... I'm responsible.

32:39.165 --> 32:40.375
It was my fault...

32:42.377 --> 32:45.630
and I wanted to tell you that in person

32:45.713 --> 32:49.175
because I know you're angry,
and you should be...

32:50.551 --> 32:53.679
-so I'm here to... [breathing heavily]
-You want me to punish you.

32:55.306 --> 32:56.432
Is that it?

32:58.977 --> 33:02.355
With what... you want me to beat you?

33:03.189 --> 33:06.026
Press charges?
Send you to prison?

33:08.153 --> 33:09.154
Why?

33:12.198 --> 33:14.367
[voice breaking] Because I don't know
how else to make it right.

33:16.744 --> 33:18.829
There is no making it right.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.917
I'm not interested in giving you
whatever it is you think you need

33:23.001 --> 33:24.419
so you can atone.

33:25.461 --> 33:29.465
See, I don't care whether
you're able to heal yourself from this.

33:29.549 --> 33:30.966
'Cause what you done...

33:33.136 --> 33:35.596
you're gonna have to live with
for the rest of your life.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.059
That's your punishment.

33:39.850 --> 33:41.144
And you know what?

33:41.227 --> 33:44.189
It's still a hell of a lot better
than what my baby girl got.

33:46.107 --> 33:48.276
May you never have a day's peace.

33:49.735 --> 33:50.736
Never.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.655
[blubbering]

33:57.952 --> 33:59.829
[Big Boo] This isn't the right charger.

33:59.912 --> 34:02.957
-[indistinct chatter]
-What? Oh.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.293
Hey, where do you think you're going?

34:05.960 --> 34:07.712
I was just trying to get, um...

34:07.795 --> 34:10.130
just to see if there was food
in the kitchen.

34:10.215 --> 34:13.051
You are a really shitty liar.

34:13.134 --> 34:15.344
I mean, how did I ever fall for it?

34:16.262 --> 34:19.224
Seriously, shame on me.

34:19.306 --> 34:22.226
-Boo, honey, please--
-Oh, honey, let's...

34:22.310 --> 34:24.687
No! Ow! Ow!
Please don't... Ah!

34:24.770 --> 34:26.063
Hear ye! Hear ye!

34:27.982 --> 34:29.317
Gather the fuck round, bitches.

34:30.525 --> 34:35.864
I'd like to take a moment to introduce you
to Miss Linda Ferguson.

34:35.947 --> 34:38.743
She's the head of purchasing for,
wait for it...

34:38.826 --> 34:39.952
MCC.

34:40.034 --> 34:41.746
-[inmates mutter]
-[chuckles] I know.

34:41.829 --> 34:43.248
-Oh, fuck!
-[Big Boo] I know.

34:43.331 --> 34:46.458
You thought Linda here
was a hardened criminal. So did I.

34:46.542 --> 34:51.589
[chuckles] But it turns out
that she is an infiltrator.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.424
-[inmates murmur]
-She's a fucking spy.

34:53.507 --> 34:56.427
-What?
-She's a fucking bitch!

34:56.511 --> 34:59.180
Now, "purchasing" being her job title,

34:59.264 --> 35:02.767
would lead you to believe that her job
is to buy us things, right?

35:02.850 --> 35:07.397
[chuckles] But no...
in reality, her job is not to buy.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.650
Her job is to deprive.

35:10.733 --> 35:14.987
Like, you know how we
have to eat poop instead of food?

35:15.070 --> 35:16.656
Thank you, Linda.

35:16.739 --> 35:21.119
You know how we have to roll
our own tampons out of old napkins?

35:21.202 --> 35:23.204
Well, she's your girl.

35:24.079 --> 35:26.582
How about these pillows
that smell like mildew?

35:26.666 --> 35:28.959
Yup, that's her.

35:29.043 --> 35:32.922
Or these shower shoes that are so thin
the tile fungus gets through the soles?

35:33.005 --> 35:36.342
Yeah, and what about these boots
that weigh ten pounds each, huh?

35:36.426 --> 35:38.469
[Linda] No, that's not even my department!

35:39.387 --> 35:41.139
-[inmate] Fuck you, Linda!
-[Linda screams]

35:41.222 --> 35:42.432
[inmates clamoring]

35:42.515 --> 35:44.309
You know what this reminds me of?

35:44.392 --> 35:46.894
When I went to go visit my family
in Bucaramanga,

35:46.977 --> 35:48.979
some guy stole my cousin's purse,

35:49.063 --> 35:51.732
the whole town got together
and lynched the guy right in front of us.

35:51.816 --> 35:52.817
-Mmm.
-Mmm-hmm.

35:52.900 --> 35:55.278
They do that shit in Mexico, too.
So fucked-up.

35:55.361 --> 35:57.613
-Hello? Justice was served.
-Oh, shit.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.240
Hello?
We're crimers, too.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.492
If we lived there,
we would've got, like, super lynched.

36:01.576 --> 36:06.622
No, down there, if you're super cute,
you don't have to do crime.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.458
You just marry a drug boss or something.

36:08.541 --> 36:11.169
[clicks tongue] We grew up
on the wrong side of the border, I swear.

36:11.252 --> 36:12.712
-Mmm-hmm.
-Shit.

36:13.963 --> 36:15.005
[inmate] Fucking bitch!

36:15.089 --> 36:16.382
[Linda crying]

36:16.466 --> 36:18.634
Come on!
Is that all you got?

36:19.969 --> 36:21.136
What's happening?

36:21.221 --> 36:23.598
[crowd protesting indistinctly
in the distance]

36:24.724 --> 36:27.477
My God.
Look at all those people.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.978
[Carreras]
Yeah, it's 'cause of some video.

36:29.061 --> 36:30.605
All of this is because of the video?

36:30.688 --> 36:32.523
Weird mix it's drawing in, right?

36:32.607 --> 36:35.276
If I was walking by that crowd,
I'd figure Oprah must have died.

36:36.277 --> 36:37.862
What going on with the negotiations?

36:37.945 --> 36:40.740
We got them.
The demands. All but one.

36:40.823 --> 36:41.824
Get the fuck out.

36:41.907 --> 36:44.202
But then Taystee
had to pull her dick out, and now--

36:44.285 --> 36:46.746
It's just a matter of time
before they come back with everything.

36:46.829 --> 36:48.038
Keep telling yourself that.

36:48.122 --> 36:51.292
-So we're not getting the demands?
-It's a wait-and-see.

36:52.960 --> 36:57.257
[crowd chanting] Shut Litchfield down!
Shut Litchfield down!

37:02.345 --> 37:03.513
[dialing]

37:04.430 --> 37:05.515
[sniffs]

37:07.016 --> 37:08.976
[cell phone ringing]

37:10.228 --> 37:11.646
-[Carol] Hello?
-Mom!

37:11.729 --> 37:15.190
[gasps] Piper, honey, is that you?

37:15.275 --> 37:16.692
What are you doing here?

37:16.776 --> 37:21.989
My child is trapped in a prison riot.
One shows up for those sorts of things.

37:22.072 --> 37:23.949
Please tell me you're not leading it.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.744
I guess I should be flattered
that you think of me as a leader.

37:26.827 --> 37:28.288
Honey, are you okay?

37:29.497 --> 37:30.498
No.

37:32.833 --> 37:36.170
-I mean, it's Alex.
-Did something happen?

37:36.254 --> 37:37.255
Yeah.

37:38.548 --> 37:43.093
We went through something
really horrible together and, um...

37:46.013 --> 37:48.933
Do you remember when I used to say
that I wasn't afraid of dying?

37:49.559 --> 37:53.187
You'd say it every time you jumped off
your grandma's roof into the pool.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.856
[chuckles softly]
Well, I think I'm finally scared.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.986
Because I came pretty close to dying.

38:01.904 --> 38:03.864
I mean, closer than I've ever been.

38:04.490 --> 38:06.534
And it made me realize that...

38:06.617 --> 38:08.828
I don't want to miss out
on being with her.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.667
I want to stick around because of her.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.877
I'm so sorry.
I know you didn't come here to hear that.

38:16.961 --> 38:22.342
Oh, no, no, honey, honey, it's not easy.
But I'm glad you have someone like that.

38:22.425 --> 38:27.805
I mean, I remember when I first realized
that I felt that way about your father.

38:27.888 --> 38:32.518
I was a freshman in college
and we had this devastating hurricane.

38:32.602 --> 38:36.021
I mean, half of the university
was under water, and...

38:36.105 --> 38:38.983
several of us were trapped in a dorm.

38:39.066 --> 38:44.029
Thought I would die from the heat,
waiting for the life rafts to come.

38:44.113 --> 38:49.702
And then I saw your father
paddling across the lawn...

38:49.785 --> 38:51.245
in a rowboat.

38:52.162 --> 38:55.708
He knew I was in there,
so he volunteered to bring us some food.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.336
Cans of corn.

38:59.795 --> 39:01.088
That's what he brought me.

39:01.171 --> 39:03.048
I didn't know that.

39:03.132 --> 39:04.634
-Yes.
-[chuckles]

39:04.717 --> 39:07.345
It's nice that
you want to be there for Alex.

39:08.638 --> 39:13.726
I always thought you would be the girl
in the relationship though,

39:13.809 --> 39:17.897
but I suppose there was always
a healthy dose of testosterone in you.

39:17.980 --> 39:20.483
[chuckles] So I shouldn't be surprised.

39:21.651 --> 39:24.987
Two steps forward and one step back,
but we're making progress.

39:25.070 --> 39:27.990
[Nash] People, we need you
to move this whole area 40 feet back!

39:28.073 --> 39:29.534
Let's go!
Come on, move!

39:29.617 --> 39:32.077
-I have to go.
-[Nash] Get 'em back.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.830
-Mom?
-[Nash] Let's go, people.

39:34.914 --> 39:37.625
-Come on, move.
-[people clamoring]

39:38.834 --> 39:43.130
How about a Chinese character
that says tranquility?

39:43.213 --> 39:44.757
Oh, come on.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.134
A Chinese character
can never pronounce tranquility.

39:47.217 --> 39:48.302
Larry.

39:49.679 --> 39:51.346
She'll admit that was funny later.

39:52.264 --> 39:53.724
So Noah Berkowitz--

39:53.808 --> 39:55.976
-[sighs] Berkovich. Yeah.
-Berkovich.

39:56.060 --> 39:59.814
So he was way deep
in the superhero culture.

39:59.897 --> 40:01.190
He was five.

40:01.273 --> 40:05.277
I was five, too, but I saw them all
for the frauds that they were.

40:05.360 --> 40:07.988
You know,
Batman with his gadgets. Spidermin--

40:08.072 --> 40:09.490
Spider-Man.

40:09.574 --> 40:10.783
-What?
-Spider-Man.

40:10.866 --> 40:13.453
-That's what I said.
-You said "Spidermin."

40:13.536 --> 40:15.705
Like he's a dermatologist
on the Upper East Side.

40:15.788 --> 40:19.500
Whatever. [chuckles]
It was all a big, fat lie.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.752
Most of the men I knew
couldn't even run up a flight of stairs,

40:21.836 --> 40:24.129
let alone leap tall buildings or fly.

40:24.922 --> 40:27.550
-Maybe I should get a yin-yang?
-[grunts] Lame.

40:27.633 --> 40:29.469
"Lame"?

40:29.552 --> 40:31.053
You're getting the Kool-Aid Man.

40:31.136 --> 40:34.474
Yeah, a hero with a practical ability.

40:34.557 --> 40:36.266
-Breaking through a wall?
-No.

40:36.350 --> 40:39.937
He satisfies your thirst on demand.
That's a hero in my book.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.522
That's a cocktail waitress.

40:41.606 --> 40:44.358
I'm still holding out
for the ability to fly.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.610
All done.

40:47.069 --> 40:49.489
[grunting]

40:52.157 --> 40:53.200
[Larry] Oh, yeah!

40:53.283 --> 40:54.827
-Your mother's gonna kill you.
-[grunts]

40:54.910 --> 40:57.121
My mother doesn't see
this part of my body anymore.

40:57.204 --> 40:59.289
You took your pants off
in front of her last week.

40:59.373 --> 41:02.376
I had a weird skin thing.
I wanted her take on it.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.044
From now on,
I'll call Dr. Spidermin for it.

41:04.128 --> 41:06.631
I don't know, she sniffs out secrets
like a truffle pig.

41:07.548 --> 41:09.216
So what are you getting?

41:10.384 --> 41:11.385
[chuckles]

41:11.469 --> 41:13.804
-Oh, I... I think I'm gonna pass.
-What?

41:13.888 --> 41:15.556
-Yeah.
-No, come on, get one.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.934
Another one, where, you know, in a place
where people can see it this time.

41:19.018 --> 41:21.061
It's not-- My tattoo is not for me.

41:21.979 --> 41:23.022
It's...

41:24.273 --> 41:27.777
[sighs] It's for other people.
It's a reminder of beauty.

41:28.402 --> 41:33.198
And 'cause I'm a... I'm a Pisces, right?
It's like a fish tattoo of destiny.

41:34.158 --> 41:35.367
Exactly.

41:37.870 --> 41:39.955
It's a fish tattoo of destiny.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.084
Larry?

41:46.754 --> 41:47.880
Lare?

41:56.346 --> 41:57.765
[exhales heavily]

42:00.017 --> 42:01.476
[sighs]

42:01.561 --> 42:03.270
[breathing heavily]

42:05.565 --> 42:07.983
[whooshing breath softly]

42:09.318 --> 42:10.611
[line ringing]

42:10.695 --> 42:12.446
[cell phone ringing]

42:16.283 --> 42:17.326
Shit.

42:18.536 --> 42:19.662
It's her.

42:20.955 --> 42:22.372
Fuck! Oh, fuck, she knows.

42:23.248 --> 42:26.168
-Hey, it's Vause. Leave a message.
-[line beeps]

42:26.251 --> 42:27.670
[Piper] Shalom.

42:29.964 --> 42:33.092
You know that means "hello" and "goodbye"?
Just like "aloha."

42:33.175 --> 42:35.678
But you probably knew that.

42:35.761 --> 42:38.305
Something that you may not know...

42:40.558 --> 42:41.809
is that today...

42:43.728 --> 42:46.647
my boyfriend got a tattoo...

42:47.565 --> 42:49.734
of the Kool-Aid Man.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.026
Oh, yeah.

42:52.444 --> 42:55.364
And believe me, Al...

42:55.447 --> 42:59.534
it's no "Love is pain." [chuckles]

42:59.619 --> 43:01.286
This is Piper, by the way.

43:02.997 --> 43:05.708
Blast from the past.
Do you recognize my voice?

43:07.001 --> 43:11.005
Boy, well, I guess things...

43:12.965 --> 43:16.385
You know things are bad
when you're calling old girlfriends

43:16.468 --> 43:19.847
from the bathroom floor
in the middle of the night, huh?

43:21.974 --> 43:23.475
How are you still...

43:24.852 --> 43:27.980
[sighs] in my brain?

43:29.398 --> 43:30.608
Where are you?

43:33.944 --> 43:35.863
Do you miss me?
Probably not.

43:35.946 --> 43:37.572
I miss you.

43:37.657 --> 43:38.908
I don't know what I'm doing.

43:40.701 --> 43:41.744
Shalom.

43:45.372 --> 43:47.750
I don't know what I'm doing.
Shalom.

43:50.460 --> 43:52.963
So what did the mystery lady have to say?

43:53.964 --> 43:56.175
Does the schnauzer get clipped at dawn?

43:56.258 --> 43:58.302
[indistinct chatter on TV]

44:00.638 --> 44:01.847
Are you okay?

44:03.598 --> 44:04.725
Fuck, do we need to get out of here?

44:04.809 --> 44:08.145
Um, yeah. Yeah, you need...
you need to get out of here.

44:08.228 --> 44:11.565
-Seriously?
-Yeah, you need to go.

44:12.482 --> 44:15.527
Oh. Okay. Um...

44:16.862 --> 44:17.863
Okay.

44:17.947 --> 44:21.241
-Look, it's for your own safety.
-Sure. I get it. I get it.

44:31.168 --> 44:33.963
-[Ouija] Move over. Move over!
-Oh, fuck.

44:34.046 --> 44:35.089
[Ouija] Shit.

44:35.798 --> 44:37.174
-[groans]
-[water splashing violently]

44:37.257 --> 44:40.260
-Are you kidding me right now?
-All the other stalls are full.

44:40.344 --> 44:42.221
[gasps and groans]

44:44.849 --> 44:48.102
Is that pee? 'Cause it sounds
like pee, but it smells like shit.

44:48.185 --> 44:49.561
Well, it feels like lava.

44:49.644 --> 44:52.732
When that article said
espresso's the poor man's cocaine...

44:53.733 --> 44:57.987
-I thought that meant we could snort it.
-I don't think it's the coffee. [panting]

44:58.070 --> 44:59.404
I think it's, like,

44:59.488 --> 45:02.074
what happens to your intestines
when you fuck up real bad.

45:02.157 --> 45:03.743
Stress does hit me in the gut.

45:04.659 --> 45:06.411
Maybe we should have
stayed out of this whole thing.

45:07.537 --> 45:09.749
Sat out in the yard,
getting sun or some shit.

45:09.832 --> 45:12.459
No. [breathing heavily]
Fuck that.

45:13.836 --> 45:15.087
We did what we believed in.

45:17.131 --> 45:18.673
Ain't no one can take that from us.

45:20.050 --> 45:21.176
Except they did.

45:21.802 --> 45:24.054
Not yet, they haven't. [panting]

45:28.642 --> 45:30.227
[toilet flushes]

45:31.686 --> 45:33.313
We gotta tell Jefferson.

45:33.397 --> 45:36.025
And maybe there's a chance
that we can walk away from the table

45:36.108 --> 45:37.526
with what we still got.

45:38.527 --> 45:41.363
-That's still a win by me.
-But we can't go out there.

45:41.446 --> 45:44.867
If those bitches find out
we lost the hostages, they'll kill us.

45:44.950 --> 45:47.661
Or shove us into some crap box,
like they've been doing.

45:47.744 --> 45:49.121
Or like we've been doing.

45:51.206 --> 45:54.334
Don't make me question the mixed morality
of what we been doing here.

45:57.587 --> 45:58.588
Come on.

45:59.381 --> 46:01.926
You think about what you're gonna say
in the press conference?

46:02.009 --> 46:05.637
'Cause we should be complementary
but not redundant.

46:06.555 --> 46:08.598
You think they'll ask me to say something?

46:09.599 --> 46:11.268
They brought you a suit.

46:11.351 --> 46:14.021
[crowd protesting indistinctly
in the distance]

46:14.939 --> 46:15.940
[sighs]

46:16.023 --> 46:17.482
Forty-four short.

46:17.566 --> 46:20.069
They think I'm fucking
Danny DeVito over here?

46:23.322 --> 46:25.740
And they never brought
my goddamn crackers.

46:25.825 --> 46:27.827
They forget your boxers, too.

46:27.910 --> 46:28.994
[zips pants]

46:33.415 --> 46:36.585
In and out?
Five minutes, tops.

46:38.087 --> 46:39.213
Don't touch the hair.

46:39.296 --> 46:40.380
[unzips pants]

46:41.090 --> 46:44.218
You think if I touch that thing,
it'll actually move an inch?

46:44.301 --> 46:45.302
It's a fucking helmet.

46:46.345 --> 46:47.721
[Fig gasps]

46:47.804 --> 46:49.223
[Caputo grunts]

46:50.682 --> 46:51.892
We have a situation.

46:53.643 --> 46:55.938
Miss Jefferson
did not release the hostages.

46:56.021 --> 46:57.522
An inmate helped them escape.

46:58.815 --> 46:59.900
What?

46:59.984 --> 47:02.736
Miss Jefferson clearly has no intention
of ending this riot.

47:02.819 --> 47:03.946
So we will have to.

47:15.290 --> 47:17.001
[gasps softly]

47:17.084 --> 47:18.668
Mmm. [chuckles softly]

47:23.173 --> 47:24.424
[slurps]

47:27.302 --> 47:28.428
[grunts]

47:31.140 --> 47:32.349
[sighs]

47:51.618 --> 47:52.995
[sniffs]

47:53.954 --> 47:55.164
[sighs]

47:58.667 --> 48:00.169
[sniffs] Mmm.

48:01.086 --> 48:02.337
[chuckles]

48:05.882 --> 48:09.344
[Luschek] So is it true?
About your son's surgery?

48:09.428 --> 48:10.429
Yeah.

48:11.972 --> 48:13.057
Will he be okay?

48:14.266 --> 48:17.186
They're doing this thing
called trepanation.

48:17.269 --> 48:19.980
My aunt tried to explain it, but I don't
think she understands it, either.

48:21.190 --> 48:22.816
I know trepanation.

48:22.899 --> 48:25.777
They basically...
lift the upper flap of your scalp

48:25.860 --> 48:28.822
and drill a hole under your skull
to release pressure on the brain.

48:28.905 --> 48:30.615
You making this shit up right now?

48:30.699 --> 48:33.452
Uh, no. Uh, my...
my roommate, freshman year,

48:33.535 --> 48:35.787
uh, he did it for enlightenment.

48:36.830 --> 48:37.914
Yeah, it's a thing.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.293
You went to college?

48:41.376 --> 48:44.213
That's what you found
most surprising about that sentence?

48:44.296 --> 48:47.174
-You don't look like the type.
-I didn't go to college-college.

48:47.257 --> 48:48.842
Uh, more like I...

48:48.925 --> 48:52.721
moved near campus and lived off
tuition checks till my parents found out.

48:52.804 --> 48:54.181
Shit.

48:54.264 --> 48:57.601
If you were my kid,
I would've slapped that ass till it bled.

48:57.684 --> 48:59.144
Yeah, my mom, uh...

48:59.228 --> 49:02.022
she put raisins in everything
that she cooked for about a month.

49:04.316 --> 49:07.819
-Very passive-aggressive.
-Better than aggressive-aggressive.

49:10.864 --> 49:13.200
Maybe my kids
would have turned out better...

49:14.118 --> 49:18.247
if I hadn't always been
so damn pissed at them all the time.

49:20.374 --> 49:23.418
I always thought if I didn't yell at them,
if I didn't spank them,

49:23.502 --> 49:26.921
then they would turn out to be
these little wake-and-bake shits

49:27.006 --> 49:28.507
with nothing in their lives.

49:28.590 --> 49:30.592
I'll pretend like that doesn't hit home.

49:34.013 --> 49:37.599
Uh, hey, you know,
from what I remember about trepanation,

49:37.682 --> 49:40.102
I... I think the survival rates
are actually pretty high.

49:41.103 --> 49:42.437
I mean, my roommate lived.

49:43.355 --> 49:44.939
He's not exactly normal, but...

49:45.815 --> 49:47.192
Not normal?

49:47.276 --> 49:50.237
High survival rates.
That's the message here.

50:03.458 --> 50:04.834
[dial tone]

50:06.295 --> 50:07.504
[sighs]

50:07.587 --> 50:08.880
[dialing]

50:09.798 --> 50:11.466
[cell phone rings]

50:13.885 --> 50:15.637
Yeah, hello?

50:15.720 --> 50:19.433
[Nicky] Vincent, hi.
Uh... you don't know me.

50:19.516 --> 50:22.018
-But I am Lorna's friend.
-What?

50:23.478 --> 50:24.938
She put you up to this?

50:25.021 --> 50:26.648
Look, you tell Lorna

50:26.731 --> 50:29.568
I don't know why she keeps playing
these mind games with me.

50:29.651 --> 50:33.029
First, I'm having sex with her sister,
and now she's having a baby?

50:33.113 --> 50:34.239
Shit's bananas.

50:34.323 --> 50:37.784
All right, all right, man. [stutters]
I get it. All right? I get it. Believe me.

50:37.867 --> 50:40.995
Uh, Lorna can be a little intense.
She can go overboard.

50:41.080 --> 50:42.581
Which is why she has not one,

50:42.664 --> 50:46.210
but 12 pregnancy tests
all lit up like Christmas trees.

50:47.544 --> 50:49.963
Are you saying she's really pregnant?

50:50.046 --> 50:52.257
I'm guessing it wasn't your intelligence
that attracted her.

50:52.341 --> 50:54.843
Hey, you know what? Fuck you.
I didn't sign up for this shit.

50:54.926 --> 50:57.471
But that's where you're wrong,
'cause you did sign up for this.

50:57.554 --> 51:00.099
I mean, you had your choice of women
out there in the real world.

51:00.182 --> 51:02.809
Uh, within your realm
of possibility, but still...

51:02.892 --> 51:04.811
There was a pool of fours,
maybe even some fives

51:04.894 --> 51:07.314
with okay tits for you to choose from.
But instead...

51:07.397 --> 51:09.899
you, uh, went fishing in the felon pond.

51:09.983 --> 51:13.945
So, either you're an asshole who knew
that women in here are so desperate

51:14.028 --> 51:15.071
you could hook yourself an eight,

51:15.155 --> 51:19.409
or you're as batshit as Lorna,
in which case, match made in heaven.

51:19.493 --> 51:22.537
-She thinks I'm fucking her sister.
-Oh... Are you?

51:22.621 --> 51:24.456
No! God, no.

51:24.539 --> 51:26.791
She's got, like, four kids.
And no tits.

51:26.875 --> 51:29.378
I mean, I keep telling Lorna this.
She don't listen to me.

51:29.461 --> 51:32.506
Just keep telling her until she does.

51:32.589 --> 51:34.007
Yeah?

51:34.090 --> 51:37.469
You know... all her life,
all she has ever wanted

51:37.552 --> 51:40.472
is for somebody to reassure her
that she is worthy of love.

51:40.555 --> 51:42.974
So if you do that, then, um...

51:43.057 --> 51:45.685
you know, she will be good to you,
she will take care of you.

51:45.769 --> 51:51.316
She will even overlook all those things
that are so deeply fucked-up in you.

51:52.317 --> 51:56.238
Uh, and yeah,
when she gets out of here, she will, uh...

51:56.321 --> 52:02.202
uh, probably hack your phone or maybe,
uh, key some female coworker's car.

52:02.286 --> 52:04.413
But, yeah, she's gonna do it
'cause she loves you.

52:04.496 --> 52:05.622
And, uh... [chuckles]

52:05.705 --> 52:11.085
I mean, some people would give anything
to be loved like that. [chuckles]

52:15.299 --> 52:16.633
That's all I gotta say.

52:18.177 --> 52:23.765
Just stew in your juice, and then, uh...
yeah, do the right thing.

52:29.979 --> 52:32.357
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

52:34.651 --> 52:37.279
Litchfield, 3:35,
you know, they're boarding already.

52:38.613 --> 52:39.948
Yeah, thanks.

52:40.657 --> 52:41.741
You're not in a hurry, huh?

52:42.659 --> 52:45.161
I can't blame you.
I went there once for a swim meet.

52:45.245 --> 52:46.538
It's kind of Shitsville.

52:48.790 --> 52:50.584
Isn't it all kind of Shitsville?

52:50.667 --> 52:54.128
Uh... no, actually.
There's some pretty cool places out there.

52:56.881 --> 52:58.132
Where would you go?

52:59.259 --> 53:00.885
If I could go anywhere?

53:00.969 --> 53:03.888
Uh, New Orleans, probably.
There's a girl there.

53:05.098 --> 53:08.560
Uh, Portland. Obviously not in the winter.
Taos, maybe.

53:08.643 --> 53:12.146
[man on PA] Last boarding call for
express bus to Albany and Poughkeepsie.

53:13.440 --> 53:17.611
Last boarding call for Albany
and Poughkeepsie, Bus 419.

53:17.694 --> 53:20.280
-Thanks.
-Thanks, man. Have a safe trip.

53:20.364 --> 53:22.115
[indistinct chatter]

53:27.329 --> 53:29.539
[woman on PA] This is
the final boarding call for the 3:35

53:29.623 --> 53:34.336
to Albany, Utica and Litchfield,
departing immediately from gate 14.

53:40.384 --> 53:42.761
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

53:49.351 --> 53:51.060
You don't handle her like this!

53:51.144 --> 53:54.314
Well, maybe what I've done for Suzanne
ain't what you would've done, but I tried.

53:54.398 --> 53:55.565
You were "busy."

53:55.649 --> 53:58.026
I was trying to make sure
we was doing right by Poussey.

53:58.610 --> 54:03.323
Oh, whoa, whoa! I know you two piñatas
ain't really waltzing up in here

54:03.407 --> 54:05.950
after chaining Suzanne
to her bed like a damn dog.

54:06.034 --> 54:09.329
-They did what, now?
-Settle down. We on the same team here.

54:09.413 --> 54:11.623
See, I ain't opposed
to hitting people on my team.

54:11.706 --> 54:13.583
Stop.
None of that matters.

54:14.668 --> 54:18.422
The hostages are gone.
Mendoza and Ruiz helped them escape.

54:18.505 --> 54:20.131
Wait, wait, wait.
The guards are gone?

54:20.214 --> 54:22.551
Also the hot one
that think he speak Italian.

54:22.634 --> 54:24.052
You mean gone-gone?

54:24.135 --> 54:26.846
Like no-more-bargaining-chips-on-the-table
gone?

54:26.930 --> 54:28.181
Shit, man!

54:28.264 --> 54:30.725
You really think "shit"
is the best word for this situation?

54:30.809 --> 54:34.228
'Cause me, personally,
I'd upgrade to "holy fucking Fucksville."

54:34.313 --> 54:36.856
We were thinking maybe we can
still walk away with what we got so far.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.651
-Yeah, I... I don't think we can do that.
-Why the hell not?

54:39.734 --> 54:40.944
Just wait here.

54:41.027 --> 54:43.405
-I'm gonna go get Fig back.
-Back from where?

54:43.488 --> 54:44.864
[door opens]

54:48.702 --> 54:49.703
Hey.

54:55.208 --> 54:58.127
I thought you might wanna go back
to your sexy librarian look.

54:58.211 --> 55:00.464
'Cause that's why I wear them.

55:00.547 --> 55:02.507
It has nothing to do
with the having-to-see thing.

55:02.591 --> 55:04.092
-Right, there's that too. Okay.
-[sighs]

55:04.175 --> 55:05.844
I need you to listen to me
for a second.

55:07.095 --> 55:08.805
I think that this thing might be over

55:08.888 --> 55:11.975
and I'm gonna be able to get you
some real help soon,

55:12.058 --> 55:13.184
but first...

55:20.650 --> 55:22.235
I want you to have this.

55:23.152 --> 55:24.863
-Beans.
-[Alex] A can of beans?

55:24.946 --> 55:26.948
Just pretend it's corn.
It's a very long story.

55:28.324 --> 55:29.993
You have taught me...

55:31.411 --> 55:34.623
that... love hurts.

55:36.040 --> 55:38.710
You've taught me that life...

55:38.793 --> 55:40.462
[breath trembling]

55:43.256 --> 55:44.466
[sighs]

55:47.343 --> 55:48.470
it hurts.

55:51.180 --> 55:53.517
And I want to be there for you.

55:53.600 --> 55:55.394
I want us to be there for each other.

55:56.520 --> 55:57.937
So that maybe...

56:01.107 --> 56:02.901
it hurts a little less.

56:08.031 --> 56:09.949
Alex Pearl Vause...

56:12.911 --> 56:16.415
Yes, Piper Elizabeth Chapman? [chuckles]

56:18.917 --> 56:20.710
Will you be my partner...

56:22.295 --> 56:25.214
through love and through pain...

56:26.466 --> 56:30.386
and through beauty fish, forever?

56:32.972 --> 56:34.390
Is that your question?

56:38.812 --> 56:40.480
Alex, will you marry me?

56:43.733 --> 56:45.485
I figured that's what you were doing.

56:49.864 --> 56:50.949
And...

56:52.534 --> 56:53.535
yes.

56:53.618 --> 56:54.994
[Anita] Bravo!

56:55.078 --> 56:57.121
-[Piper chuckles]
-Mazel.

56:57.205 --> 56:58.832
[all chuckling]

56:58.915 --> 57:00.834
[all cheering]

57:02.001 --> 57:04.253
[inmates chatter indistinctly]

57:06.798 --> 57:08.174
You had to do this now?

57:09.092 --> 57:13.179
[chuckles] I mean, I guess timing
has never been either of our strong suits.

57:13.262 --> 57:14.931
I kind of think that I did.

57:15.014 --> 57:17.350
And you did just say yes!

57:17.434 --> 57:19.561
-That is what I said, isn't it?
-Mmm-hmm.

57:20.269 --> 57:22.146
[Frieda] I think it's legal now, isn't it?

57:27.068 --> 57:28.778
[inmates clamoring]

57:29.904 --> 57:32.616
Tell them to wait! Tell them to wait!

57:32.699 --> 57:36.119
Tell them to wait! Wait!

57:38.287 --> 57:39.581
[panting]

57:46.420 --> 57:47.421
-[officer] Clear!
-[thud]

57:47.506 --> 57:49.508
