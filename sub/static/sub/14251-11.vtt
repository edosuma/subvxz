WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:07.670
Animali!

00:08.842 --> 00:11.538
Bruti animali!

00:11.611 --> 00:13.135
Animali!

00:13.213 --> 00:16.181
No, Leonardo,
you are the animal!

00:16.248 --> 00:18.308
A bird who cannot fly!

00:18.385 --> 00:20.683
Better than a man
who cannot think!

00:20.754 --> 00:21.686
The pigeon speaks!

00:24.891 --> 00:26.518
Maestro!

00:28.261 --> 00:30.252
Stupido!

00:30.330 --> 00:32.525
Foolish Florentines!

00:36.836 --> 00:38.770
A bird is
a mechanical instrument

00:38.838 --> 00:42.205
that works according
to mathematical laws.

00:42.275 --> 00:45.005
An instrument that surely
l can recreate.

00:45.078 --> 00:47.012
How did it fail?

00:47.080 --> 00:49.878
Maybe you underestimated
the wingspan.

00:49.949 --> 00:52.042
Had not the River Arno
taken us to its arms,

00:52.118 --> 00:53.676
we would both have died.

00:53.753 --> 00:56.051
Jumping off the bridge
was a wise precaution.

00:56.122 --> 00:58.716
Against death, yes.

00:58.792 --> 01:02.694
Against humiliation...no.

01:02.762 --> 01:08.530
"The great bird will take flight
and bring glory to its nest"--

01:08.601 --> 01:10.933
so l have bragged for months.

01:11.004 --> 01:16.306
lnstead, we almost drown
with half of Florence watching.

01:18.011 --> 01:19.979
Finito!

01:20.046 --> 01:21.138
No more.

01:22.682 --> 01:24.172
Catarina...

01:25.285 --> 01:26.980
have you been to France?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.315
Not recently.

01:28.388 --> 01:31.653
Ah. The king of France
is a great admirer of mine.

01:31.724 --> 01:33.988
"The divine Leonardo"
is all l hear

01:34.060 --> 01:35.755
when l walk through his streets.

01:35.829 --> 01:39.287
And what music do l find
in the streets of Florence, eh?

01:39.365 --> 01:43.563
The cooing of pigeons
and the babbling of fools.

01:43.636 --> 01:45.536
Catarina, we are leaving.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.203
You're giving up.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.040
Hmm?

01:53.146 --> 01:55.137
Again.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.945
Your beautiful painting
of the Adoration...

01:58.017 --> 02:01.384
the great bronze horse
in Milan...

02:01.454 --> 02:03.183
the Battle of Anghiari...

02:03.256 --> 02:05.281
unfinished, all of them.

02:05.358 --> 02:06.723
You were going to publish
your notebooks.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.725
You never did.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.318
You have given up--

02:10.395 --> 02:13.263
abandoned
your most important works.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.322
Why?

02:20.006 --> 02:22.099
There is a...

02:22.175 --> 02:23.870
a tavern just outside Paris,

02:23.943 --> 02:27.606
Catarina, a charming bistro
where the wine is...

02:28.848 --> 02:29.815
Terramotto.

02:29.883 --> 02:30.815
Janeway to the Bridge.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.215
We're under attack, Captain.

02:32.285 --> 02:33.752
l'm on my way.

02:37.757 --> 02:41.784
Earthquakes...and idiots.

02:41.861 --> 02:43.829
Florence be damned.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:43.283 --> 04:44.807
Who are they and why
are they shooting at us?

04:44.884 --> 04:45.816
Unknown, Captain.

04:45.885 --> 04:46.977
They're not responding
to hails.

04:47.053 --> 04:47.985
Damage?

04:48.054 --> 04:48.986
None.

04:49.055 --> 04:51.080
l'm reading
a slight destabilization

04:51.157 --> 04:52.089
along the shield perimeter.

04:52.158 --> 04:53.921
Attempting to compensate.

05:03.369 --> 05:04.734
Uh, Torres to the Bridge.

05:04.804 --> 05:05.771
Go ahead.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.772
We just lost
the warp diagnostic assembly.

05:07.840 --> 05:08.864
What do you mean"lost"?

05:09.008 --> 05:10.134
lt disappeared.

05:19.886 --> 05:22.514
l'm picking up
dematerializations on Decks 4

05:22.588 --> 05:24.180
- through 12.
- Evasive maneuvers.

05:25.692 --> 05:27.489
They're matching
our course changes.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.800
lt's definitely some kind
of transporter beam.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.669
Fire at will.

05:41.741 --> 05:42.969
l have the will,

05:43.076 --> 05:44.270
but not the means, Captain.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.811
Targeting control is down.

05:45.878 --> 05:46.902
Why?

05:46.979 --> 05:49.504
Captain, the main
computer processor is gone.

05:49.582 --> 05:52.312
We've lost weapons, navigation
and propulsion.

05:52.385 --> 05:54.353
Backup systems
are coming on line.

05:54.420 --> 05:55.819
Full phasers, manual targeting,

05:55.888 --> 05:58.049
keep firing
until you hit something.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.053
The other ships are retreating.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.062
Chakotay to all decks.

06:05.131 --> 06:06.962
Full damage reports.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.002
l feel like
we've just been mugged.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.404
They were employing
a high- energy transporter beam

06:22.482 --> 06:25.042
designed to locate objects
of technological value

06:25.118 --> 06:26.449
and remove them.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.350
They removed a lot.

06:28.421 --> 06:30.548
Five tricorders,
three phaser rifles,

06:30.623 --> 06:33.353
a couple of photon
torpedo casings,

06:33.426 --> 06:34.757
two antimatter injectors,

06:34.827 --> 06:36.556
a month's supply
of emergency rations.

06:36.629 --> 06:38.119
No great loss there.

06:38.197 --> 06:39.255
Excuse me.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.323
You're forgetting
the most important thing

06:41.401 --> 06:43.369
of all-- my mobile emitter.

06:43.436 --> 06:44.698
Without it,
l'm stuck in Sick Bay.

06:44.771 --> 06:45.738
l can't go anywhere.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.329
We'll do
the best we can, Doctor,

06:47.407 --> 06:50.672
but our top priority is
the main computer processor.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.643
B'Elanna, l want a defense
against another

06:52.712 --> 06:54.304
transporter attack.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.245
Harry, do everything you can
to track

06:56.315 --> 06:57.782
- those ships.
- Yes, ma'am.

06:57.850 --> 06:58.839
Dismissed.

07:02.822 --> 07:05.382
Seven...hey...

07:05.458 --> 07:07.858
lf you're here to fraternize,
l do not have the time.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.019
Actually, the Captain
wanted me to locate

07:10.096 --> 07:11.427
the ships that attacked us.

07:11.497 --> 07:12.794
l've pushed
the long- range sensors

07:12.865 --> 07:13.991
about as far as they'll go...

07:14.066 --> 07:15.795
And now you believe the
sensors can be extended

07:15.868 --> 07:17.836
by using the deep space
imaging system.

07:17.904 --> 07:19.667
Well, yes.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.866
l've been working
on that exact procedure

07:21.974 --> 07:23.669
for the past two hours.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.677
Really?
Let's have a look.

07:25.745 --> 07:28.578
Do you doubt my ability
to finish the task?

07:28.648 --> 07:30.047
lt...

07:30.116 --> 07:31.276
Look...

07:31.350 --> 07:33.910
l came here to work.

07:33.986 --> 07:37.888
Um...l realized you'd
already started the job...

07:37.957 --> 07:40.221
so l offered to help.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.260
That's all.

07:42.261 --> 07:43.785
l offered to help.

07:45.097 --> 07:46.291
An algorithmic feedback

07:46.365 --> 07:48.196
is interfering
with the resolution.

07:48.267 --> 07:51.065
Decompile data banks
59 through 17

07:51.137 --> 07:52.570
and attempt to isolate it.

07:55.541 --> 07:56.872
Now...

07:58.010 --> 07:59.944
or you should leave.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.946
Okay.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.010
l'm a pretty easygoing person.

08:08.087 --> 08:09.748
l mean, it takes a lot to...

08:09.822 --> 08:11.483
ruffle my...feathers.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.584
But that's not true
of everybody.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.027
You've got to learn
how to phrase things

08:18.097 --> 08:20.895
a little more...
diplomatically.

08:24.804 --> 08:26.237
Or not.

08:29.876 --> 08:34.313
Captain's Log, Stardate 51386. 4.

08:34.380 --> 08:37.110
With ship's systems
at nearly half capacity,

08:37.183 --> 08:41.381
it's taken us ten days
to track our stolen technology.

08:41.453 --> 08:42.921
l'm picking up
Starfleet signatures

08:42.989 --> 08:44.547
from two of the continents.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.819
Can you find the main
computer processor?

08:46.893 --> 08:50.989
lt's on the northern continent
in what looks like a city...

08:52.064 --> 08:53.588
but there's a lot
of signal interference.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.258
l'll never be able
to localize it from here.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.734
Captain, l've identified

08:57.803 --> 09:00.931
nearly 27 kinds of alien ships
in orbit of this planet.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.373
lt appears to be an active
center of commerce.

09:03.442 --> 09:05.171
We should be able to place
an undercover away team

09:05.244 --> 09:07.576
on either continent
without attracting attention.

09:07.647 --> 09:08.841
That's good enough for now.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.008
Tuvok, you and l
are going after the processor.

09:11.083 --> 09:12.209
Tom, Neelix, l want you

09:12.285 --> 09:13.980
on the other continent,
find out what you can.

09:14.053 --> 09:17.454
At the very least, try to get
our emergency rations back.

09:17.523 --> 09:18.888
Chakotay, you have the Bridge.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.780
lt never fails to impress me.

09:42.848 --> 09:44.179
No matter how vast
the differences

09:44.250 --> 09:46.480
may be between cultures,
people always have something

09:46.552 --> 09:49.350
that somebody else wants
and trade is born.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.253
Or more to the point, theft.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.450
What have you got?

09:52.525 --> 09:54.925
The materials in
the construction of this city,

09:54.994 --> 09:56.461
and the technology in use

09:56.529 --> 09:58.326
appear to have originated
from numerous sources.

09:58.397 --> 09:59.762
No doubt stolen.

09:59.832 --> 10:01.459
The myriad signatures
have resulted

10:01.534 --> 10:02.899
in high interference levels.

10:02.969 --> 10:05.733
l am unable to...
A moment.

10:05.805 --> 10:07.739
l am picking up
a Starfleet signature.

10:07.807 --> 10:08.831
The computer processor?

10:08.908 --> 10:09.875
l don't believe so.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.876
The signal magnitude
is too low.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.640
The signature is...

10:14.714 --> 10:15.942
approaching.

10:16.015 --> 10:17.243
Catarina!

10:17.316 --> 10:18.613
Che maraviglia!

10:18.684 --> 10:19.480
Out of my way!

10:19.552 --> 10:21.076
Out of my way!
Scusa.

10:21.153 --> 10:22.085
Perdono.

10:22.154 --> 10:23.314
Catarina!

10:24.757 --> 10:25.781
Welcome!

10:25.858 --> 10:28.486
Welcome to America!

10:41.007 --> 10:42.338
Tell me, Catarina,

10:42.408 --> 10:43.773
what do you think
of the New World?

10:43.843 --> 10:45.276
How did you get here?

10:45.344 --> 10:47.869
A question l have
asked myself many times.

10:47.947 --> 10:50.142
One moment, l was packing
for my journey to France,

10:50.216 --> 10:52.684
the next, l was in this land
of marvels.

10:52.752 --> 10:55.949
Possibly, upon leaving
my workshop,

10:56.022 --> 10:58.388
l was accosted
by Spanish sailors...

10:58.457 --> 11:01.017
rendered unconscious,
delivered to a galleon

11:01.093 --> 11:03.687
in the port
of Genoa and carried

11:03.763 --> 11:06.926
like a sack of grain
across the vast Atlantic.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.523
Curious ears.

11:08.601 --> 11:11.900
My traveling companion,
Tuvok.

11:11.971 --> 11:15.407
Oh, what the old
philosophers say is true--

11:15.474 --> 11:17.908
"monstrous and wonderful
are the peoples

11:17.977 --> 11:19.911
of undiscovered lands."

11:19.979 --> 11:21.776
But tell me, Catarina...

11:21.847 --> 11:24.111
how did you come
to the Americas?

11:24.183 --> 11:26.549
Oh, it's a long story.

11:26.619 --> 11:30.077
A Portuguese ship,
some Turkish pirates...

11:30.156 --> 11:31.088
a couple of hurricanes...

11:31.157 --> 11:32.681
l'll tell you all about
it some other time.

11:32.758 --> 11:33.918
Excuse me.

11:33.993 --> 11:36.188
There is the man that l
have been looking for.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.093
He has an apparatus
that l need

11:38.164 --> 11:39.893
for my next invention.

11:39.965 --> 11:41.796
My patron is
a demanding taskmaster.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.164
Your patron?

11:43.235 --> 11:46.136
The prince of this city.

11:46.205 --> 11:49.072
Buon giorno, signori.

11:50.843 --> 11:53.277
The da Vinci character
is interpreting this world

11:53.345 --> 11:55.438
through the limited capacity
of his holodeck program.

11:55.514 --> 11:57.982
He sees everything
in 16th century terms.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.517
But what is he doing here?

12:00.519 --> 12:02.384
l was running
the da Vinci simulation

12:02.455 --> 12:03.786
when we were attacked.

12:03.856 --> 12:07.917
His program must have been
active in the computer's memory

12:07.993 --> 12:10.484
when the processor
was beamed off the ship.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.157
And then downloaded into
the Doctor's mobile emitter.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.563
But by whom?

12:14.633 --> 12:16.123
His patron?

12:16.202 --> 12:17.464
The prince?

12:22.374 --> 12:24.808
Marvelous, no?

12:24.877 --> 12:27.311
A plasma injector conduit.

12:27.379 --> 12:28.641
Starfleet issue.

12:28.714 --> 12:30.079
Call it what you will.

12:30.149 --> 12:31.582
With this machine, l can make

12:31.650 --> 12:34.118
mercury flow
in three directions at once.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.983
You must see my new workshop.

12:36.055 --> 12:37.579
The prince has been
very supportive.

12:37.656 --> 12:38.623
Andiamo.

12:40.192 --> 12:41.386
Let's go.

12:49.668 --> 12:51.602
So, Catarina...

12:51.670 --> 12:53.501
what do you think of this place?

12:55.407 --> 12:56.806
My workshop in Florence

12:56.876 --> 12:59.344
was but a cave of ignorance
in comparison.

12:59.411 --> 13:03.142
Your new patron
gave you all this?

13:03.249 --> 13:05.581
He is the perfect prince.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.553
lntelligent--
but not overly so.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.021
ln awe of my talent,
but not threatened by it.

13:11.090 --> 13:14.184
And above all,
and most importantly,

13:14.260 --> 13:17.161
his purse is inexhaustible.

13:17.229 --> 13:21.131
And in return
for all this support?

13:21.200 --> 13:22.758
l give him my ideas.

13:29.008 --> 13:31.101
l have even resurrected
my great bird,

13:31.177 --> 13:33.441
like the phoenix of legend.

13:33.512 --> 13:35.946
They have materials here,
Catarina,

13:36.015 --> 13:38.108
that are so strong and so light

13:38.184 --> 13:41.779
that surely my prototype
will ascend to the heavens.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.323
Be careful!

13:49.395 --> 13:51.727
They have found a way

13:51.797 --> 13:54.527
to harness the energy
of a thunderstorm

13:54.600 --> 13:56.659
and to expel it
with great force.

13:56.735 --> 13:59.363
A pistole that shoots
not a lead ball

13:59.438 --> 14:01.838
but a bolt of lightning.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.141
Well, l'd like to meet
this patron of yours.

14:11.217 --> 14:13.845
And so you shall
this very evening.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.284
But l caution you...

14:15.354 --> 14:18.448
he is as ruthless as a Borgia.

14:23.829 --> 14:28.323
First Officer's Log,
Stardate 51392. 7.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.800
Though we've yet to hear
from the Captain and Tuvok,

14:30.870 --> 14:33.031
Paris and Neelix have returned
from their mission

14:33.105 --> 14:36.097
to the southern continent
with some disturbing evidence.

14:36.175 --> 14:37.904
Who sold you these things?

14:37.977 --> 14:40.172
l didn't come here
to be interrogated.

14:40.246 --> 14:42.441
You told me you had
a warp coil to trade.

14:42.514 --> 14:45.449
l said you could
talk with Commander Chakotay.

14:45.517 --> 14:48.247
l didn't say he'd necessarily
do business with you.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.617
Well, this is
a waste of my time.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.781
l agree.

14:51.857 --> 14:52.949
There's the door.

14:53.025 --> 14:53.753
What?

14:53.826 --> 14:55.623
Good- bye.
Make sure he doesn't

14:55.694 --> 14:56.683
get lost on the way out.

14:56.762 --> 14:58.127
No, wait, wait.

14:58.197 --> 15:00.131
His name is Tau.

15:00.199 --> 15:02.667
He controls the Seventh Province
in the North.

15:02.735 --> 15:03.861
He sells weapons and technology.

15:03.969 --> 15:04.867
Yes.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.995
Which he confiscates
from passing ships.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.063
Yes, using
his translocator device.

15:09.141 --> 15:10.699
Which he also stole.

15:10.776 --> 15:12.471
lt's made him a rich man.

15:12.544 --> 15:15.035
There are a few items
l'd like to get back.

15:15.114 --> 15:16.604
Where can l find him?

15:16.682 --> 15:18.172
l deal with a go- between.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.447
l've answered enough
of your questions.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.112
Let's talk about that warp coil.

15:23.188 --> 15:24.120
l'm looking for something...

15:24.189 --> 15:25.747
You can keep what you've got.

15:25.824 --> 15:27.883
We'll call it even.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.198
This was a waste of my time.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.528
Not really.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.434
These colors look good on you.

15:45.010 --> 15:48.309
Torpedoes, plasma grenades...

15:48.380 --> 15:49.369
particle beam rifles...

15:49.448 --> 15:50.938
l can even get
a ceremonial spear

15:51.016 --> 15:52.381
if you're interested.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.316
l am not interested.

15:56.221 --> 15:58.917
My point is, no matter
what the weaponry,

15:58.991 --> 16:00.652
if you desire it,

16:00.726 --> 16:02.421
chances are l have it.

16:02.494 --> 16:04.587
Or l can get it.

16:11.036 --> 16:14.130
Your prices are said
to be unreasonable.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.540
"Unreasonable" is
such a strong term.

16:17.609 --> 16:18.667
But if l can't sell to you,

16:18.744 --> 16:20.109
l'll sell to one
of the other colonies

16:20.179 --> 16:21.305
in your system.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.644
A violent sort,
your neighbors, aren't they?

16:23.716 --> 16:25.741
l'd hate to make
your life difficult

16:25.818 --> 16:27.581
by offering my weapons to them.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.678
But if you don't
give me a choice...

16:32.124 --> 16:34.092
There can be no doubt

16:34.159 --> 16:36.354
our computer processor
is not in the city.

16:36.428 --> 16:38.589
Well, that certainly
makes things

16:38.664 --> 16:40.222
a little more difficult.

16:40.299 --> 16:43.325
Leonardo's new patron.

16:43.402 --> 16:44.699
He's quite the businessman.

16:44.770 --> 16:47.933
We may have no choice
but to do business with him.

16:48.073 --> 16:49.438
Catarina!

16:49.508 --> 16:52.170
Here are some friends
l want you to meet.

16:52.244 --> 16:54.508
Try to keep
our hologram occupied.

16:54.580 --> 16:55.911
But, Captain...

16:55.981 --> 16:57.471
Well, make small talk.

16:57.549 --> 16:59.517
Vulcans do not make small talk.

16:59.585 --> 17:00.950
lmprovise.

17:03.155 --> 17:04.315
Thank you.

17:04.390 --> 17:05.686
That is very considerate.

17:05.758 --> 17:06.690
Catarina, wait a minute!

17:06.759 --> 17:09.090
Mr. Da Vinci, how have you been?

17:09.161 --> 17:10.856
Benissimo.
Now if you will pardon me.

17:10.929 --> 17:12.419
l wish to speak with you.

17:12.498 --> 17:13.521
What about?

17:13.598 --> 17:14.861
About you.

17:14.933 --> 17:17.560
You are most intriguing.

17:17.636 --> 17:19.228
Ah, grazie.

17:19.304 --> 17:22.137
And you, Signore Tuvok,
are equally provocative.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.731
Where, exactly, are you from?

17:23.809 --> 17:25.606
Scandinavia.

17:29.081 --> 17:33.541
So...what do
the Scandinavians think

17:33.619 --> 17:34.813
of this New World?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.720
lt is...fascinating.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.655
And you are
obviously enjoying it.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.886
Beyond words.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.325
Yes.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.920
ltaly is already
a fading memory.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.762
This city is full
of mechanical marvels,

17:48.834 --> 17:50.893
the countryside
alive with creatures

17:50.969 --> 17:54.405
strange and wonderful.

17:54.473 --> 17:56.031
l'm curious.

17:56.108 --> 17:58.303
How have you spent
your time here?

17:58.377 --> 18:03.610
l work...on my
inventions and my art,

18:03.682 --> 18:07.140
and l accompany the prince

18:07.219 --> 18:09.881
when he goes to visit
his great fortresses.

18:10.055 --> 18:12.353
Well, this fascinating
conversation...

18:14.226 --> 18:16.490
has left me as dry as Vulcan.

18:16.562 --> 18:18.086
Vulcan?

18:18.163 --> 18:19.858
An island off Sicily.
Have you been there?

18:19.965 --> 18:21.830
No.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.197
Pity.

18:33.745 --> 18:35.610
We'll talk later.

18:35.681 --> 18:37.478
Good evening.

18:37.549 --> 18:39.414
And to you.

18:39.485 --> 18:42.010
Enjoying yourself?

18:42.087 --> 18:43.019
Not yet.

18:43.088 --> 18:44.077
No?

18:44.156 --> 18:45.919
How can l change that?

18:45.991 --> 18:47.515
By having exactly what l want

18:47.593 --> 18:49.458
and selling it to me
at a low price.

18:51.096 --> 18:53.087
The former's quite likely,
but as for the latter,

18:53.165 --> 18:56.032
l don't sell
inexpensive merchandise.

18:56.101 --> 18:58.296
l have a client
who runs a colony

18:58.370 --> 19:00.235
about 20 parsecs from here.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.273
His computer is outmoded,

19:02.341 --> 19:05.242
so l'm...looking
for a replacement.

19:05.310 --> 19:10.145
A computer that could coordinate
the systems of an entire colony.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.206
That's no small order.

19:12.284 --> 19:13.683
But l think
l might have something

19:13.752 --> 19:14.741
that will interest you.

19:24.062 --> 19:26.690
Hello, Computer,
and how are you today?

19:26.765 --> 19:30.428
All systems are functioning
within normal parameters.

19:30.502 --> 19:34.598
Verbal interface.
lmpressive.

19:34.673 --> 19:39.167
Computer, tell us
your technical specifications.

19:39.244 --> 19:42.771
Simultaneous access
to 47 million data channels,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.782
transluminal processing

19:44.850 --> 19:47.785
at 57 5 trillion calculations
per nanosecond.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.184
lnterested?

19:49.254 --> 19:52.052
Operational temperature margins
from ten degrees kelvin

19:52.124 --> 19:54.354
to 1, 790 degrees kelvin.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.155
l could sell it to you,

19:56.228 --> 20:00.028
but l could hardly let it go
for anything less than...

20:00.098 --> 20:01.531
a warship.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.702
Or we could find something else
in your price range.

20:19.985 --> 20:21.714
We should be looking
for a stronghold

20:21.787 --> 20:22.981
or storage facility--

20:23.055 --> 20:25.990
anyplace Tau might keep
the stolen technology.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.992
There are
several possibilities,

20:28.060 --> 20:30.995
all within a ten- kilometer
radius of the city.

20:31.063 --> 20:35.898
l must admit, your Mr. Da Vinci
is an astute observer of nature.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.731
These maps
couldn't be improved upon

20:37.803 --> 20:39.532
by Voyager's
topographical computer.

20:39.605 --> 20:42.972
He was a Renaissance man, Tuvok.

20:43.041 --> 20:47.740
lnterpreted, reinterpreted,
deconstructed, fantasized about

20:47.813 --> 20:49.474
all through history.

20:49.548 --> 20:51.607
Vasari thought he was an angel.

20:51.683 --> 20:54.049
Freud thought he had
a problem with his mother.

20:54.152 --> 20:56.052
James T. Kirk
claimed he met him,

20:56.121 --> 20:58.055
although the evidence
is less than conclusive.

20:58.156 --> 20:59.555
Buon giorno, amici.

20:59.625 --> 21:01.286
Good morning, Maestro.

21:01.393 --> 21:02.325
Did you sleep well?

21:02.361 --> 21:03.692
Too well, l'm afraid.

21:03.762 --> 21:06.890
My apologies, Catarina.

21:06.965 --> 21:08.227
The morning is half gone.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.097
Nevertheless, the images

21:10.168 --> 21:13.194
that come before the eyes
upon awakening

21:13.272 --> 21:15.069
can be inspiring.

21:21.413 --> 21:23.278
lndeed.

21:23.348 --> 21:26.283
Catarina, where did l leave
my silver- tip pen?

21:26.351 --> 21:27.750
l could swear
it was here on...

21:27.819 --> 21:30.788
Captain, we should
return to Voyager.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.950
With my tricorder readings
and Leonardo's maps,

21:34.026 --> 21:36.290
we can use the ship's sensors
to triangulate

21:36.361 --> 21:38.226
the exact location
of our processor.

21:40.565 --> 21:42.760
We'll work on two fronts.

21:42.834 --> 21:43.994
You go back to the ship.

21:44.069 --> 21:45.798
l'll stay on the surface and
keep working with Leonardo.

21:45.871 --> 21:46.929
He has access to Tau

21:47.005 --> 21:48.472
and he knows the territory.

21:48.540 --> 21:49.768
lnadvisable.

21:49.841 --> 21:52.571
Charming as your childhood hero
may be,

21:52.644 --> 21:55.306
the program was not designed
for use outside the holodeck.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.871
This is Leonardo da Vinci
we're talking about.

21:57.949 --> 22:00.247
Simulation or not,
he's one of the greatest

22:00.319 --> 22:02.219
creative minds
in Earth's history.

22:02.287 --> 22:04.915
The program reproduces
the entire range

22:04.990 --> 22:07.823
of da Vinci's behavior--
his genius

22:07.893 --> 22:10.088
and his notorious
unreliability.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.255
We have an opportunity here...

22:14.566 --> 22:16.898
and l want
to take advantage of it.

22:23.608 --> 22:24.939
Tuvok to Voyager.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.409
One to beam up.

22:34.686 --> 22:36.176
..table.

22:36.254 --> 22:37.380
Where did he go?

22:37.456 --> 22:39.083
Back to the ship.

22:39.157 --> 22:40.488
The ship?

22:40.559 --> 22:44.086
You mean, the Portuguese
are still in the harbor?

22:44.162 --> 22:49.122
Well...not exactly...
but they're nearby.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.328
Ah.

22:51.403 --> 22:54.463
Mad sea dogs, the Portuguese.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.407
So, what's new?

23:05.484 --> 23:06.849
New?

23:06.918 --> 23:08.545
What's been happening
on the ship?

23:08.620 --> 23:10.053
Nothing of consequence.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.054
The Captain and Tuvok

23:11.123 --> 23:12.818
are still searching
for the processor.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.916
What's the mood?

23:15.026 --> 23:17.085
lf you're referring
to the crew morale,

23:17.162 --> 23:19.756
they seem focused
on their mission.

23:19.831 --> 23:23.164
Hmm. l heard there was
something of a fuss

23:23.235 --> 23:24.361
in the Mess Hall last night.

23:24.436 --> 23:25.926
A trivial misunderstanding.

23:26.004 --> 23:27.335
Oh?

23:28.874 --> 23:31.138
Well, you seem
in excellent health.

23:31.209 --> 23:32.870
Most of your implants
are stable,

23:32.944 --> 23:36.141
but your optical interface
is misaligned again.

23:36.214 --> 23:40.150
l told you to come in
for maintenance once a week.

23:40.218 --> 23:45.281
So...what happened
in the Mess Hall?

23:47.926 --> 23:49.917
Lieutenant Torres
and l were working

23:49.995 --> 23:51.428
on some astrometric data.

23:51.496 --> 23:52.724
There was a disagreement.

23:52.798 --> 23:55.426
l understand things got
a little...heated.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.798
Lieutenant Torres
became emotional.

23:57.869 --> 23:59.700
She chose to display hostility

23:59.771 --> 24:01.466
rather than to counter
my argument.

24:01.573 --> 24:03.302
What did she say exactly?

24:03.341 --> 24:04.330
lt is irrelevant.

24:04.409 --> 24:06.434
Suffice it to say,
l was correct.

24:06.511 --> 24:07.478
She was not.

24:07.546 --> 24:10.640
Details, Seven,
l want specifics.

24:10.715 --> 24:13.513
l see no reason to discuss
these trivialities.

24:13.585 --> 24:15.917
Without my mobile emitter,
l am a prisoner in here.

24:15.987 --> 24:17.750
l need to know
what is going on

24:17.823 --> 24:19.882
beyond these walls,
trivial or not.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.891
Torres referred to me
as an automaton.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.191
She also employed

24:26.264 --> 24:29.028
a series of profane
Klingon insults.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.159
Shall l translate them for you?

24:31.236 --> 24:32.430
By all means.
l very much...

24:32.504 --> 24:33.971
Tuvok to Seven of Nine.

24:34.072 --> 24:36.336
Report to the Astrometrics Lab.

24:36.408 --> 24:38.876
You may go.

24:38.944 --> 24:40.172
l'll be right there, Commander.

24:40.245 --> 24:41.940
Come back whenever you feel
like talking.

24:42.013 --> 24:45.949
l'll be right here...
all by myself.

24:50.222 --> 24:51.883
l'm entering Leonardo's maps

24:51.957 --> 24:54.790
and my tricorder data
into the imaging system.

24:54.860 --> 24:55.986
l will create
a search pattern

24:56.061 --> 24:57.722
for our missing processor.

24:57.796 --> 24:59.388
Da Vinci has
accurately rendered

24:59.464 --> 25:00.726
the topographical detail.

25:00.832 --> 25:03.699
However, his coordinate
axes are pre- Cartesian.

25:03.735 --> 25:05.225
You will have to convert them.

25:05.303 --> 25:06.463
Understood.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.333
lt is puzzling that even

25:09.407 --> 25:11.568
a Vulcan would refer
to a holographic character

25:11.643 --> 25:13.702
by name, as if it were alive.

25:13.778 --> 25:17.544
lt seems somehow...illogical.

25:20.886 --> 25:22.877
Localizing grid.

25:23.922 --> 25:25.890
Altitude:
20 kilometers.

25:25.957 --> 25:27.356
One of these
storage facilities

25:27.425 --> 25:29.052
undoubtedly contains
the processor.

25:29.127 --> 25:32.221
lncrease sensor resolution
to maximum and scan the area.

25:35.433 --> 25:36.627
There.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.295
Our computer processor
is inside this structure.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.396
Unfortunately, the building

25:41.473 --> 25:43.441
is surrounded
by a dispersion field.

25:43.508 --> 25:45.135
Transport will be impossible.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.337
lf the Captain can get
inside the facility

25:47.412 --> 25:50.643
and reach the processor itself,
she may be able to assist us.

25:50.715 --> 25:54.776
lf she were to initiate
a power surge in the processor,

25:54.853 --> 25:57.947
it might produce a signal strong
enough for us to lock onto.

25:58.023 --> 25:59.991
That is what l was referring to.

26:00.025 --> 26:02.050
l will inform the Captain.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.864
lt's not too far,
across open country.

26:14.973 --> 26:18.807
Leonardo says he's been there,
and he can help me get inside.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.037
Understood.

26:20.111 --> 26:21.578
Stand by for my signal.

26:21.646 --> 26:23.113
lf l can find the processor,

26:23.181 --> 26:25.581
be prepared
to beam it back to Voyager.

26:25.650 --> 26:26.582
Aye, Captain.

26:26.651 --> 26:27.640
Tuvok out.

26:28.853 --> 26:31.083
So it's Captain?

26:31.156 --> 26:35.058
l see you and my hologram
are old friends.

26:54.879 --> 26:56.938
My engineers have
developed a defense

26:57.015 --> 26:58.642
against your transporter,

26:58.717 --> 27:01.447
so l suggest you return
what you took from us

27:01.553 --> 27:02.815
and let me go.

27:02.854 --> 27:04.344
Or what?

27:04.422 --> 27:06.049
You're in no position
to bargain.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.955
The only ones who will
bargain will be your crew

27:08.026 --> 27:09.152
and it'll cost them

27:09.227 --> 27:11.991
a great deal to get
their Captain back.

27:12.063 --> 27:13.894
l wonder what you're
worth to them...

27:17.402 --> 27:18.426
He'll be fine.

27:18.503 --> 27:19.800
Let's move.

27:19.871 --> 27:20.860
l'm not going.

27:21.006 --> 27:21.995
You said you'd help me.

27:22.073 --> 27:23.631
l have already gone too far.

27:23.708 --> 27:26.040
He was threatening you,
l had no alternative.

27:26.111 --> 27:28.238
But l must be here
when he recovers his senses.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.405
l will try to explain.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.506
Maybe, if l am lucky,
he will not have me executed.

27:31.583 --> 27:32.515
We are leaving.

27:32.584 --> 27:33.676
Your time here is over.

27:33.752 --> 27:35.617
l will not leave this New World!

27:35.687 --> 27:37.382
Your New World is a prison.

27:37.455 --> 27:38.615
You are under his control.

27:38.690 --> 27:39.782
When are we not in prison?

27:39.858 --> 27:40.916
Hmm?

27:40.992 --> 27:43.119
When are our lives free
from the influence

27:43.194 --> 27:45.128
of those who have
more power than us?

27:46.831 --> 27:51.825
lf this New World is a cage,
than it is a cage of gold,

27:51.903 --> 27:53.370
of marvels--

27:53.438 --> 27:55.406
of opportunities.

27:55.473 --> 27:59.910
lf this prince is violent,
violence can be tempered.

27:59.978 --> 28:01.843
But you can't stay
here forever, Leonardo.

28:01.946 --> 28:03.607
Europe is your home.

28:03.648 --> 28:05.843
Europe is despicable.

28:05.950 --> 28:09.579
Here l am free to do
what l wish,

28:09.654 --> 28:12.384
free from judgment,
free to fail--

28:12.457 --> 28:15.187
without a sense
of shame, without...

28:15.260 --> 28:17.319
without the taunts
of the ignorant.

28:17.395 --> 28:20.228
Leonardo, whether you want
to admit it or not,

28:20.298 --> 28:22.596
they do need you back home.

28:22.667 --> 28:25.693
ln Florence, Milan, Avignon--

28:25.770 --> 28:29.206
they need your genius,
they need your heart

28:29.274 --> 28:31.742
and right now, l need you, too.

28:31.810 --> 28:32.834
So come on.

28:36.614 --> 28:38.844
l will not go...

28:38.917 --> 28:42.785
for Florence or Milan
or Avignon...

28:44.823 --> 28:46.484
but for you, Catarina...

28:49.961 --> 28:51.826
for you, l will go.

29:01.206 --> 29:03.572
l've lost the Captain's
combadge signature.

29:03.641 --> 29:05.768
Scan for the holo- emitter.

29:08.613 --> 29:11.582
lt's 4. 7 kilometers
outside the city.

29:11.649 --> 29:13.116
So Leonardo's on the move.

29:13.184 --> 29:14.617
ls the Captain with him?

29:14.686 --> 29:16.745
Her combadge may have
malfunctioned.

29:16.821 --> 29:18.015
Or she might have been
discovered.

29:18.089 --> 29:20.023
Should l beam da Vinci
back to the ship?

29:20.091 --> 29:21.183
lf the Captain is with him

29:21.259 --> 29:22.988
and attempting to recover
the processor,

29:23.061 --> 29:24.323
she may need his assistance.

29:26.030 --> 29:27.429
Keep a lock
on the mobile emitter

29:27.499 --> 29:28.466
and stand by.

29:28.533 --> 29:29.500
Aye, sir.

29:34.038 --> 29:35.027
Where's the entrance?

29:35.106 --> 29:36.095
l can't recall.

29:36.174 --> 29:37.141
Why not?

29:37.208 --> 29:38.641
These fortresses--

29:38.710 --> 29:40.143
l've been to half a dozen
of them.

29:40.211 --> 29:41.906
All are similar,
but each is different.

30:08.406 --> 30:11.170
Catarina,
observe the construction--

30:11.242 --> 30:14.211
like the veins and arteries
of a great animal.

30:14.279 --> 30:16.474
Now, this is the way to build--
using nature as your guide.

30:16.548 --> 30:17.480
No more lessons.

30:17.549 --> 30:18.481
l need to get into

30:18.550 --> 30:20.245
this building and l need
to get into it now.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.615
That is not the way

30:21.686 --> 30:24.052
an apprentice should address
her master.

30:27.058 --> 30:30.494
Maestro, your prince is
going to come after us.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.427
The only escape is inside.

30:32.497 --> 30:33.521
Escape?

30:33.598 --> 30:35.463
We will be trapped inside.

30:35.533 --> 30:38.127
No. There is a wondrous
invention inside this building.

30:38.203 --> 30:40.296
lt's called
a computer processor.

30:40.371 --> 30:42.566
We can use to send
a beacon to...

30:42.640 --> 30:44.369
to the Portuguese ship.

30:44.442 --> 30:46.376
And they'll come
and rescue us.

30:46.444 --> 30:47.877
Computer?

30:47.946 --> 30:50.210
This invention,
how does it work?

30:50.281 --> 30:52.010
Well, it's complicated...

30:52.083 --> 30:53.141
but trust me when l say

30:53.218 --> 30:55.186
it can send messages
over great distances.

30:55.253 --> 30:57.483
All we have to do is find it
and we will be rescued.

30:57.555 --> 31:00.285
But the question is:
How do we get inside?

31:05.129 --> 31:07.563
Shadow and sunlight.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.365
Shadow and sunlight.

31:15.139 --> 31:17.107
The prince,
like any other thief,

31:17.175 --> 31:20.167
will fear theft above all else.

31:20.245 --> 31:23.146
So this stronghold will
have but one entryway--

31:23.214 --> 31:26.513
on the side facing
away from the sun.

31:26.584 --> 31:27.516
So the bright light

31:27.585 --> 31:29.450
would be in the eyes of
anyone who might attack.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.647
Esatto.

31:38.196 --> 31:39.993
Hmm...

31:40.064 --> 31:42.726
l'm no longer reading
the mobile emitter.

31:43.668 --> 31:45.533
They've gone inside
the structure.

31:45.603 --> 31:47.730
Commander,
they are being pursued.

31:47.805 --> 31:48.794
Over 30 armed guards

31:48.873 --> 31:50.670
are converging
on the storage facility.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.710
All available power
to the transporters.

31:52.777 --> 31:54.540
Let's try to get them
out of there.

31:54.612 --> 31:58.013
Even Theseus could not
negotiate this labyrinth.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.549
Not without a compass.

32:00.785 --> 32:02.685
Your compass is speaking to you.

32:04.022 --> 32:05.489
This way.

32:24.242 --> 32:26.506
A trove of invention.

32:30.782 --> 32:33.478
The prince has done
well for himself.

32:33.551 --> 32:36.349
Phasers...

32:36.421 --> 32:38.514
warp plasma injectors...

32:38.589 --> 32:40.386
a site- to- site transporter.

32:45.763 --> 32:47.458
Your computer?

32:47.532 --> 32:48.624
Yes.

32:52.070 --> 32:54.004
Computer, do you recognize
my voice?

32:54.138 --> 32:55.002
Affirmative.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.902
Well, that's a start.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.465
Che bella!

32:58.543 --> 33:00.408
There's a mechanical woman
inside.

33:00.511 --> 33:02.172
ln a way, yes.

33:02.213 --> 33:04.909
lnitiate a level- 4
induction relay overload.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.110
That procedure
is not recommended.

33:07.185 --> 33:09.915
Command override:
Janeway- pi- one- one- zero.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.751
Authorization confirmed.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.313
lnitiating overload.

33:16.361 --> 33:17.328
That's it.

33:17.395 --> 33:18.623
And now?

33:18.696 --> 33:21.062
We wait for the Portuguese.

33:21.132 --> 33:23.032
Commander, l'm detecting
a power surge

33:23.101 --> 33:24.659
in the subspace frequency range.

33:24.736 --> 33:26.067
lt could be the processor.

33:26.137 --> 33:27.069
Lock on.

33:27.138 --> 33:29.265
lncrease power
to the confinement beam.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.307
With any luck,

33:30.375 --> 33:31.535
we might be able
to pull the Captain

33:31.609 --> 33:32.633
out of there along with it.

33:39.917 --> 33:41.145
Step close, Leonardo.

33:41.219 --> 33:42.481
We're going for a ride.

33:42.553 --> 33:43.747
l don't understand.

33:44.789 --> 33:46.086
Trust me.

34:11.315 --> 34:13.306
The building is probably
surrounded by now.

34:13.384 --> 34:14.578
There's only one way out.

34:18.322 --> 34:19.687
Maestro, come here.

34:19.757 --> 34:22.783
Catarina,
what just happened to me?

34:24.027 --> 34:25.859
l was shot...yet l live.

34:25.929 --> 34:28.262
Such things are not possible.

34:34.438 --> 34:37.601
This is an invention
from another land.

34:37.675 --> 34:40.303
lt's called
a site- to- site transporter.

34:40.378 --> 34:41.708
ln the blink of an eye,

34:41.779 --> 34:43.804
it can move us
out of this building

34:43.880 --> 34:45.974
and a few kilometers
away from here.

34:46.050 --> 34:47.347
How?

34:47.418 --> 34:49.409
Come on.

34:57.728 --> 34:59.662
l must have an explanation.

35:00.998 --> 35:03.660
Leonardo, you've always said

35:03.734 --> 35:07.135
that it's a poor apprentice
who can't surpass her master.

35:07.205 --> 35:10.072
There are things in this world

35:10.141 --> 35:13.304
that l understand,
and you don't.

35:20.651 --> 35:22.744
Madonna mia.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.150
The processor is on board.

35:30.228 --> 35:31.718
The Captain?

35:31.796 --> 35:33.388
Still on the planet.

35:33.464 --> 35:34.931
Commander.

35:37.301 --> 35:40.236
13 vessels are approaching
Voyager from the surface.

35:40.304 --> 35:42.169
Tom, take us
into a higher orbit.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.229
Bridge to Torres.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.605
l want that processor
back on line.

35:45.676 --> 35:47.109
We've still got
a Captain done there.

35:47.178 --> 35:48.145
Acknowledged.

35:56.921 --> 35:58.548
l cannot believe it.

35:58.623 --> 35:59.988
l will not believe it.

36:00.024 --> 36:03.983
My mind cannot accept
the evidence of my eyes.

36:04.028 --> 36:06.690
ls this sorcery?
Are we in purgatory?

36:06.764 --> 36:07.856
Neither.
You said yourself

36:07.932 --> 36:09.422
this place was full
of marvels.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.627
Marvels, yes,
but this is magic--

36:11.702 --> 36:13.431
enchantment, not science.

36:13.504 --> 36:16.667
And l refuse to believe
in enchantment.

36:16.741 --> 36:18.299
l'll explain later.
We've got to keep moving.

36:18.376 --> 36:19.434
No!

36:20.344 --> 36:23.279
l must understand.

36:23.347 --> 36:25.645
Catarina...

36:25.716 --> 36:28.150
to see objects disappear
into thin air...

36:28.219 --> 36:32.053
to see lightning
pass through my body...

36:34.592 --> 36:36.184
Are we spirits?

36:36.260 --> 36:39.286
Catarina...am l dead?

36:39.363 --> 36:41.228
Let me ask you something.

36:41.299 --> 36:44.496
lf you were something
other than a human being...

36:44.569 --> 36:46.628
if you were a different
kind of animal...

36:48.005 --> 36:50.872
if you were a small bird,
a sparrow...

36:50.942 --> 36:52.500
what would your world be like?

36:53.778 --> 36:55.769
l should make my home
in a tree

36:55.846 --> 36:57.507
in the branch of an elm.

36:57.582 --> 37:02.542
l should hunt insects for food,
straw for my nest

37:02.620 --> 37:05.418
and in the springtime,
l should sing for a companion.

37:05.489 --> 37:07.980
Then you would know nothing
of the politics of Florence?

37:08.059 --> 37:10.254
The cutting of marble,
or mathematics?

37:10.328 --> 37:11.260
Of course not.

37:11.329 --> 37:12.261
But why not?

37:12.330 --> 37:13.957
My mind would be too small.

37:15.299 --> 37:17.995
As a sparrow, your mind
would be too small

37:18.069 --> 37:20.094
even with the best of teachers?

37:20.171 --> 37:23.265
lf Aristotle himself
were to perch on my branch

37:23.341 --> 37:26.833
and lecture till he fell off
from exhaustion...

37:26.911 --> 37:30.005
still the limits of my mind

37:30.081 --> 37:32.413
would prevent me
from understanding.

37:32.483 --> 37:34.849
And as a man, can you accept

37:34.919 --> 37:37.114
that there may be
certain realities

37:37.188 --> 37:40.385
beyond the limits
of your comprehension?

37:43.227 --> 37:45.286
lf l could not accept that...

37:47.832 --> 37:50.062
then l would be a fool.

37:50.134 --> 37:51.294
Spread out! You...

37:51.369 --> 37:52.336
Come on.

37:54.438 --> 37:57.373
Catarina, this way,
up the hill.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.068
l know just the escape.

38:02.813 --> 38:05.646
Torres to Bridge.
We're in business.

38:05.716 --> 38:09.982
We've got full navigation...
full propulsion

38:10.054 --> 38:11.180
and full transporters.

38:11.255 --> 38:12.847
Good work B'Elanna.

38:12.923 --> 38:14.322
Sensors show the
Captain and da Vinci

38:14.392 --> 38:15.484
have left the structure.

38:15.559 --> 38:16.856
lf we could dip
into a lower orbit,

38:16.927 --> 38:18.724
l should be able to lock on
to the mobile emitter.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.263
Set the confinement beam wide

38:20.331 --> 38:23.198
and prepare to transport
both of them back to the ship.

38:23.267 --> 38:25.360
How close do we have to be?

38:25.436 --> 38:27.404
At least 500 kilometers
from the surface.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.735
Those ships will try
to block our descent.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.207
Ready for some fancy flying?

38:32.276 --> 38:33.709
You bet.

38:40.351 --> 38:42.512
Momento, Catarina.

38:46.257 --> 38:49.420
Escape, signorina, is very near.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.358
l'm starting to wonder.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.226
Where are you, Chakotay?

38:54.432 --> 38:55.660
Help me to the summit.

39:10.281 --> 39:12.442
We're at 1, 000 kilometers.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.848
950...

39:14.952 --> 39:16.715
900.

39:16.787 --> 39:20.484
The ships are powering weapons.

39:20.558 --> 39:22.458
Go to Red Alert.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.958
Shields are holding.

39:30.034 --> 39:31.831
850 kilometers.

39:33.904 --> 39:35.804
Evasive maneuvers.

39:35.873 --> 39:38.467
When Petrarch climbed
Mount Verdoun

39:38.542 --> 39:40.703
and saw all Europe below him,

39:40.778 --> 39:44.077
he knew he was witnessing
the birth of a new age.

39:44.148 --> 39:46.708
He was witnessing
the Renaissance--

39:46.784 --> 39:48.479
the rebirth of our world.

39:48.552 --> 39:50.918
So, Catarina,
at this summit here,

39:51.021 --> 39:53.251
you and l will be reborn.

39:53.324 --> 39:57.658
Reborn...with wings.

40:16.881 --> 40:19.349
This could be a problem.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.408
Hurry, there's not much time.

40:23.454 --> 40:26.617
Sir, they seem to be
on the edge of precipice,

40:26.690 --> 40:28.817
but we're still
too high for transport.

40:29.827 --> 40:31.886
You've made some improvements.

40:31.962 --> 40:34.556
l took your advice
after the last attempt

40:34.632 --> 40:36.691
and increased
the reach of the wings.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.394
And the angle of attack?

40:38.469 --> 40:39.401
Yes, yes, that, too.

40:39.470 --> 40:42.200
Unfortunately, the River
Arno is quite absent.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.968
This time, if we fail,

40:44.041 --> 40:46.475
only the stones
will break our fall.

40:46.544 --> 40:48.808
The wing is stationary,
that's good.

40:48.879 --> 40:50.312
This looks like duranium alloy.

40:50.381 --> 40:51.609
lt should be light enough.

40:51.682 --> 40:54.412
Catarina,
this time it will work.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.846
Let's find out.

40:59.857 --> 41:01.552
l'm reading weapons fire
on the surface

41:01.659 --> 41:02.921
near the Captain's position.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.928
We're running out
of time, sir.

41:04.995 --> 41:06.587
700 kilometers.

41:06.664 --> 41:09.098
Hold on, Kathryn,
just a few more seconds.

41:09.166 --> 41:10.929
- Together...up.
- Andiamo.

41:25.649 --> 41:27.344
Catarina, we're flying!

41:27.418 --> 41:29.477
- Like the birds!
- Like the birds!

41:47.972 --> 41:49.963
l have a fix on the Captain.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.304
They are...in mid- air

41:52.376 --> 41:55.368
on what appears to be
a crude gliding apparatus.

41:55.446 --> 41:56.310
500 kilometers!

41:56.380 --> 41:57.312
l'm locking on.

41:57.381 --> 41:59.144
Broad confinement beam.

41:59.216 --> 42:00.478
Energize.

42:09.226 --> 42:10.625
Got them!

42:10.694 --> 42:13.356
l beamed the whole contraption
into Cargo Bay 1.

42:13.430 --> 42:15.125
Get us out of here, Mr. Paris.

42:18.502 --> 42:22.461
Captain's Log, Stardate 51408. 3.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.770
We're back on course
to the Alpha Quadrant.

42:24.842 --> 42:26.810
With the ship's computer
and the Doctor's emitter

42:26.877 --> 42:28.344
returned to proper places,

42:28.412 --> 42:31.074
l've set aside some time
to check on the Maestro.

42:40.591 --> 42:42.821
Leonardo, where are you going?

42:42.893 --> 42:44.155
France.

42:44.228 --> 42:47.129
These Florentines
do not deserve my genius.

42:47.197 --> 42:48.994
l have written
to the king of France,

42:49.099 --> 42:51.465
telling him of my adventures
in the New World

42:51.535 --> 42:55.733
and invited him to soar with me
off the towers of his castle.

42:55.806 --> 42:58.172
Are you sure that's a good idea?

42:58.242 --> 42:59.675
Why not?

42:59.743 --> 43:01.711
We ourselves have tested
the design.

43:01.812 --> 43:04.246
But the materials...

43:04.281 --> 43:07.216
you'll never find
those metals in France.

43:07.284 --> 43:10.310
No?
Then others will suffice.

43:10.387 --> 43:12.912
Machines that fly
through the air!

43:13.023 --> 43:15.184
Lightning flung
from one's hands!

43:15.259 --> 43:19.491
Mechanical women
who live in boxes!

43:19.563 --> 43:21.929
These things l have seen!

43:21.999 --> 43:24.559
And these things
l must recreate.

43:24.635 --> 43:26.034
And who knows?

43:26.103 --> 43:28.094
Possibly improve upon.

43:28.172 --> 43:31.335
Leonardo, l think
that little flight of ours

43:31.408 --> 43:32.739
went to your head.

43:32.810 --> 43:35.244
And my heart.

43:35.312 --> 43:37.746
My oldest memory, Catarina,

43:37.815 --> 43:41.410
is of a great bird
perched on my bed,

43:41.485 --> 43:45.319
its feathers open towards me
as if summoning me.

43:45.389 --> 43:50.088
Now, you yourself
have accused me of giving up,

43:50.160 --> 43:53.357
of, uh, failing
to complete my project.

43:53.430 --> 43:54.397
l was trying to encourage...

43:54.465 --> 43:55.397
No, no.

43:55.466 --> 43:56.455
You were right.

43:56.533 --> 44:01.061
All my life
l have wanted to fly.

44:01.138 --> 44:04.039
Perhaps my failure to do so

44:04.108 --> 44:08.807
has caused my heart
to remain in flight.

44:08.879 --> 44:12.246
Leaping from one thing
to another.

44:12.316 --> 44:14.113
Never satisfied.

44:15.686 --> 44:17.745
Never complete.

44:17.821 --> 44:20.722
And now that you've
actually flown?

44:22.726 --> 44:26.492
Now, who knows
what l cannot accomplish.

44:27.665 --> 44:30.259
l'd like to find out.

44:31.268 --> 44:34.135
Give my regards
to the king of France.

44:48.552 --> 44:50.952
Catarina,

44:51.021 --> 44:53.615
will you walk with me
to my carriage?

44:53.691 --> 44:55.181
lt would be my pleasure.
