00:06.900 --> 00:10.517
<i>Traffic is moving nicely</i>
<i>from Meacham Road to River Road.</i>

00:10.650 --> 00:14.443
<i>There is a 20-car back up</i>
<i>at the Devon Avenue toll.</i>

00:14.570 --> 00:18.992
<i>The northbound I-290 extension</i>
<i>at Thorndale Avenue had a spin out.</i>

00:19.114 --> 00:21.948
<i>That car was blocking</i>
<i>the right-hand lane</i>

00:22.074 --> 00:27.995
<i>and the lane coming off the eastbound</i>
<i>Thorndale Avenue entrance ramp</i>

00:28.111 --> 00:32.998
<i>leading to the northbound I-290</i>
<i>extension, this caused a back up...</i>

00:38.712 --> 00:41.134
Come on, we've got relatives invading.

00:41.307 --> 00:45.221
Ginny, Mike, Sara, Sam.
Come on, everybody up.

00:48.106 --> 00:51.475
- I think I have a fever.
- You don't have a fever.

00:51.651 --> 00:54.224
- Shut your face.
- Make me.

00:54.862 --> 00:57.567
- Dad, Mike hit me.
- You liar.

00:57.740 --> 01:01.358
Mike, we've got a wedding tomorrow.
Try to cooperate.

01:01.536 --> 01:03.492
Dad, I didn't hit her.

01:03.662 --> 01:07.161
I'd like to and I probably will later
but give me a break.

01:07.332 --> 01:10.333
I don't hit her
when you're just down the hall.

01:10.502 --> 01:12.708
Pick on someone your own size.

01:15.048 --> 01:16.840
Open this door.

01:17.926 --> 01:20.085
Daddy, I'm the one getting married.

01:20.262 --> 01:23.428
Not until tomorrow.
I've got a mouthful of toothpaste.

01:23.598 --> 01:26.386
I happen to have a serious problem.

01:27.936 --> 01:32.015
Dad, she got her period.
Should make an interesting honeymoon.

01:32.189 --> 01:35.274
- Where do you learn that stuff?
- School.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.400
Good. I'm getting my money's worth.

01:38.863 --> 01:41.698
<i>They were fantastic. Just great.</i>

01:44.368 --> 01:46.408
~ <i>It's a good thing</i>
<i>you don't have a bus fare</i> ~

01:46.579 --> 01:48.946
~ <i>It would fall</i>
<i>through the hole in your pocket</i> ~

01:49.050 --> 01:51.062
~ <i>And you'd lose it</i>
<i>in the snow on the ground</i> ~

01:51.167 --> 01:54.583
~ <i>You got to walk into town</i>
<i>to find a job</i> ~

01:54.754 --> 01:57.042
~ <i>Tryin' to keep your hands warm...</i> ~

01:57.214 --> 02:00.167
Chronologically, you're 16 today.

02:00.442 --> 02:02.268
Physically...

02:03.653 --> 02:05.776
...you're still 15.

02:10.577 --> 02:12.368
Hopeless.

02:14.998 --> 02:19.292
Nope, I look exactly the same
as I have since summer.

02:19.461 --> 02:21.418
Utterly forgettable.

02:21.588 --> 02:24.505
No, I didn't expect
to wake up transformed.

02:24.674 --> 02:27.164
I thought turning 16 would be so major

02:27.342 --> 02:31.506
that I'd wake up with an improved
mental state showing on my face.

02:31.680 --> 02:35.630
All it shows is that
I don't have any sort of a tan left.

02:35.809 --> 02:37.683
I better get downstairs.

02:37.853 --> 02:42.016
My family is probably pissed off
they haven't wished me happy birthday.

02:42.191 --> 02:44.682
All right. I'll see you at school.

02:49.239 --> 02:53.236
You need four inches of bod
and a great birthday.

02:55.787 --> 02:58.325
- Where's my case?
- Where did you leave it?

02:58.498 --> 03:02.626
- Don't be a smart ass.
- OK, I'll be a dumb ass.

03:02.794 --> 03:05.545
- Where's Sam?
- Where's my briefcase?

03:05.713 --> 03:11.052
- Allow me, Brenda. Hey, birth defect!
- You missed breakfast again.

03:11.219 --> 03:16.344
It wasn't my idea to give her her own
phone line. I don't have my own.

03:18.309 --> 03:21.843
It's small, brown, leather,
it has my initials on it

03:22.020 --> 03:23.977
and I believe that's it.

03:24.147 --> 03:26.934
Don't forget
the grandparents are coming.

03:27.109 --> 03:30.976
- Are we dining with the Rice-czyk's?
- Ryszczyk's. Eight o'clock.

03:31.154 --> 03:34.072
Learn their names.
As of tomorrow, they're family.

03:34.241 --> 03:38.701
That's a lovely thought.
When it's your turn to marry, elope.

03:38.870 --> 03:41.492
- Who would marry her?
- Mr T.

03:41.665 --> 03:45.793
I'm sorry, you'll have to buy lunch.
I didn't fix your carrots.

03:45.961 --> 03:49.376
They're only to increase
the size of her breasts.

03:49.547 --> 03:52.998
Shape up
or you will miss your sister's wedding.

03:53.175 --> 03:54.420
Promise?

03:58.055 --> 04:01.092
Now don't give me
that pouty look of yours.

04:01.267 --> 04:03.592
Eat your carrots when you get home.

04:03.769 --> 04:08.348
That's it? You don't have
anything else to say to me today?

04:08.524 --> 04:11.229
What would you like me to say, Sam?

04:11.402 --> 04:16.312
Come on now, honey. You're going
to miss the bus. Have a good day.

04:18.867 --> 04:23.363
I can't believe this.
They fucking forgot my birthday.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:21.736 --> 06:25.270
They didn't forget your birthday
They didn't remember right away.

06:25.448 --> 06:27.820
Same difference.

06:27.992 --> 06:31.990
It's a drag that it's the day
before Ginny marries, but big deal.

06:32.163 --> 06:34.949
Did anyone ever forget your birthday?

06:35.123 --> 06:37.910
- Come on.
- Everything's getting shittier.

06:38.084 --> 06:40.836
My family forgetting makes it more vivid.

06:41.004 --> 06:43.459
Did you expect
a breakfast birthday party?

06:43.631 --> 06:47.546
They could have said, "Happy Birthday."
It was like any other day.

06:47.719 --> 06:51.966
Why not remind them?
Their massive guilt could be profitable.

06:52.140 --> 06:54.512
I wouldn't stoop to remind them.

06:54.684 --> 06:59.429
Since I was 12, I've looked forward
to my sweet 16 - a party, a band...

06:59.606 --> 07:01.563
Tons of people.

07:01.733 --> 07:04.602
A pink Trans-Am with a ribbon around it

07:04.777 --> 07:07.446
and a gorgeous guy you meet in France.

07:07.613 --> 07:09.985
Do it on a cloud without getting herpes.

07:10.157 --> 07:12.648
- No cloud.
- Just a pink Trans-Am and a guy?

07:12.826 --> 07:14.368
- A black one.
- A black guy?

07:14.536 --> 07:16.576
A black Trans-Am, a pink guy.

07:16.747 --> 07:18.147
Oh, no!

07:21.376 --> 07:24.413
~ <i>I remember always, always</i> ~

07:24.588 --> 07:26.415
~ <i>I got such a fright</i> ~

07:27.758 --> 07:30.592
~ <i>Seeing them in my dark cupboard</i> ~

07:30.760 --> 07:32.384
~ <i>With my great big cake</i> ~

07:33.513 --> 07:36.549
~ <i>If they were me</i>
<i>If they were me</i> ~

07:36.724 --> 07:39.559

07:45.858 --> 07:48.349
~ <i>If they were me and I was you</i> ~

07:48.528 --> 07:51.019
~ <i>Would you have liked a present too?</i> ~

07:58.328 --> 08:01.364
~ <i>Happy, happy birthday in a hot bath</i> ~

08:01.540 --> 08:03.449

08:07.796 --> 08:09.539

~ <i>If they were me and I was you</i> ~

08:31.819 --> 08:34.524
~ <i>Would you have liked a present too?</i> ~

08:48.002 --> 08:50.837
~ <i>Happy birthday, happy birthday</i> ~

08:53.923 --> 08:56.960
~ <i>Happy birthday, happy birthday</i> ~

09:00.096 --> 09:03.346
~ <i>Happy birthday, happy birthday</i> ~

09:06.227 --> 09:10.307
~ <i>Happy birthday, happy birthday</i> ~

09:12.734 --> 09:15.854
~ <i>Happy birthday, happy birthday</i> ~

09:18.782 --> 09:22.529
~ <i>Happy birthday, happy birthday...</i> ~

09:25.412 --> 09:29.492
- You swear you don't have it?
- I don't know anything about it.

09:29.666 --> 09:32.288
Jennifer Woods gave me a 'sex test'.

09:32.461 --> 09:35.711
I was supposed to do it
and pass it to you.

09:35.881 --> 09:39.048
- I'm totally screwed.
- Did you put your name on it?

09:40.094 --> 09:44.590
No, but it was embarrassing.
I named who I'd do it with if I did it.

09:44.765 --> 09:47.932
- Who did you name?
- Jake Ryan.

09:49.018 --> 09:51.307
He doesn't even know you exist.

09:51.479 --> 09:55.429
- Thank you, that's a nice thing to say!
- Sorry, but Jake Ryan?

09:55.608 --> 09:58.526
He's a senior, and taken. Really taken.

09:58.694 --> 10:01.268
I know. He's supposed to be my ideal.

10:01.447 --> 10:04.816
He's ideal for sure but forget it.

10:04.992 --> 10:08.611
I hope whoever got the note
doesn't know it was me who wrote it.

10:08.788 --> 10:10.911
I'd shit twice and die.

10:14.001 --> 10:16.208
Do you know Samantha Baker?

10:17.295 --> 10:22.800
- Sophomore, right?
- Yeah, what do you think of her?

10:23.760 --> 10:25.360
I don't.

10:25.887 --> 10:28.722
Would you ever go out with her?

10:29.933 --> 10:32.341
Depends on how much you paid me.

10:32.519 --> 10:34.476
She's not ugly.

10:36.565 --> 10:40.977
There's nothing there, man.
It's not ugly, it's just void.

10:41.153 --> 10:43.110
There's something about her.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.482
I do Independent Study with her.
She looks at me a lot.

10:46.657 --> 10:49.658
It's cool the way
she's always looking at me.

10:49.827 --> 10:51.618
Maybe she's retarded.

10:51.787 --> 10:53.863
I'm being serious. OK?

10:54.039 --> 10:57.124
She looks at me
like she's in love with me.

10:57.293 --> 10:59.535
Jake, she's a child.

10:59.712 --> 11:00.712
So?

11:01.672 --> 11:06.417
What are you going to do with her?
She's too young to party serious.

11:06.594 --> 11:09.429
Maybe I'm interested
in more than a party.

11:10.473 --> 11:15.466
Jake, you talk like you're hard up.
You've got Caroline. She's a woman.

11:19.314 --> 11:21.223
Unbelievable.

11:21.399 --> 11:25.646
I swear Caroline Mulford
had to flunk about nine grades.

11:25.820 --> 11:29.070
- It truly makes me ill.
- She's perfect.

11:29.240 --> 11:31.814
Practically impossible to cut up.

11:31.993 --> 11:37.747
She's really sweet, her brother is deaf,
and everybody worships her.

11:37.916 --> 11:42.126
And she's going with Jake.
I'm going to kill myself.

11:42.586 --> 11:43.986
My man!

11:59.311 --> 12:01.268
I loathe the bus.

12:07.902 --> 12:11.686
There has to be a more dignified mode
of transportation.

12:11.864 --> 12:15.992
- I hope you get a car for your birthday.
- Let's not hold our breath.

12:20.415 --> 12:22.906
Score. A direct hit.

12:23.084 --> 12:25.326
On second thought...

12:51.111 --> 12:52.711
Move it.

13:01.663 --> 13:04.331
- Call me.
- Call me. Tell me what happened.

13:04.498 --> 13:06.954
I can tell you right now, nothing.

13:07.126 --> 13:10.577
Feeling sorry for yourself
is bad for your complexion.

13:31.524 --> 13:33.434
How's it going?

13:33.610 --> 13:35.567
How's what going?

13:36.738 --> 13:39.739
You know, things, life, whatnot.

13:39.908 --> 13:43.988
Life is not whatnot
and it's none of your business.

13:47.207 --> 13:51.536
- Are you going to the dance tonight?
- That's also none of your business.

13:55.423 --> 13:58.672
Are you inhibited
about dancing in public?

13:58.842 --> 14:03.504
You could just stand there
with me and my dudes and just be you.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.638
Sounds major.

14:08.310 --> 14:10.931
So what's the story? You got a guy?

14:11.105 --> 14:13.430
Yes, three. They lust for wimp blood.

14:13.607 --> 14:17.819
Quit bugging me or I'll sick them all
over your weenie ass.

14:17.986 --> 14:21.272
I'm getting input
that I'm reading as relatively hostile.

14:21.448 --> 14:23.192
Go to hell.

14:24.284 --> 14:26.157
Very hostile.

14:28.371 --> 14:31.704
What's the problem?
I'm a boy, you're a girl.

14:31.874 --> 14:36.951
Is there anything wrong with me trying to
put together a relationship between us?

14:37.130 --> 14:39.917
I know you have to go.
Answer one question.

14:40.091 --> 14:41.882
Yes, you're a total fag.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.760
That's not the question.

14:45.805 --> 14:47.798
Am I turning you on?

14:57.023 --> 14:59.859
It's encouraging, very encouraging.

15:01.236 --> 15:05.068
You know a girl with a hat
is just so vogue.

15:06.199 --> 15:07.199
Yeah!

15:22.882 --> 15:25.207
Where are my blue socks, Dorothy?

15:25.384 --> 15:28.884
Do you mean you didn't pack them?
Not again, Howard.

15:29.055 --> 15:33.099
Can't I trust you?
Do you expect me to do all the packing?

15:33.267 --> 15:36.185
Well, at least I brought this for you.

15:37.480 --> 15:41.180
- Sam.
- Samantha.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.435
- Look.
- Oh, look.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.229
- Hi!
- Hi.

15:48.491 --> 15:50.091
Oh, God.

15:51.868 --> 15:56.162
Sweetheart, my goodness
are you a sight for sore eyes.

15:59.292 --> 16:04.001
Just look!
How are you, my little lamb chop?

16:04.172 --> 16:06.046
I'm fine, Grandpa.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.924
- How are you?
- Pretty good.

16:08.093 --> 16:11.093
- I have the back pain...
- My corns are killing me.

16:11.262 --> 16:14.429
I have headaches
but I brought the ice bag...

16:14.599 --> 16:16.638
So you're sleeping up here?

16:16.809 --> 16:21.803
Your Grandfather Fred jumped our claim
on Sara's room so we're here.

16:21.980 --> 16:26.310
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
Do I look any older today?

16:26.485 --> 16:30.103
- No, I wouldn't say so. Would you?
- No.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.447
I hope it isn't cold tomorrow.
You know Ginny.

16:33.617 --> 16:35.693
She'll refuse to wear a coat.

16:35.869 --> 16:39.073
- If she does you mustn't bug her.
- I'm not going to.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.747
I'll set myself up in Mike's room.
See you later.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.328
OK, sweetheart.

16:44.502 --> 16:48.547
Grandpa and I are looking forward
to a nice long, long visit with you.

16:48.715 --> 16:52.166
- Aces!
- We certainly are.

16:52.343 --> 16:55.842
See you a little later.
We've got a lot to do.

16:57.014 --> 17:00.134
I swear to God, this has got to be a joke.

17:00.309 --> 17:03.145
Grandparents forgetting a birthday?

17:03.312 --> 17:05.104
They live for that shit.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.064
~ <i>With my arms around you...</i> ~

17:09.234 --> 17:15.604
Well, well.
If it isn't Sammy Baker-Davis Junior.

17:15.781 --> 17:19.862
- Hi, Grandpa.
- I've got one for you. Knock, knock.

17:20.036 --> 17:21.494
- Who's there?
- Who.

17:21.663 --> 17:23.122
- Who who?
- Helen.

17:23.290 --> 17:26.540
We've got an owl out here in the hall.

17:29.171 --> 17:32.587
Fred, leave her alone.
You'll make her tinkle.

17:32.758 --> 17:36.625
- Come on, Helen.
- Sam, let me look at you.

17:39.889 --> 17:42.344
Fred, she's gotten her boobies.

17:42.516 --> 17:45.601
I better go get
my magnifying glass.

17:46.645 --> 17:49.849
Oh, and they are so perky.

18:02.495 --> 18:06.362
I can't believe my grandmother
actually felt me up.

18:11.419 --> 18:13.827
What's happening, hot stuff?

18:15.006 --> 18:18.090
His name is Long Duk Dong.

18:18.259 --> 18:21.593
- What?
- Long Duk Dong.

18:21.763 --> 18:26.176
He came with Grandma and Grandpa
Baker. He's an exchange student.

18:26.351 --> 18:28.178
He is totally bizarre.

18:28.353 --> 18:32.730
He is not. He is a very sweet boy.

18:32.899 --> 18:37.311
I just hope you burn the sheets
and mattresses after he leaves.

18:37.486 --> 18:41.649
There's a very weird Chinese guy
up in Mike's room.

18:41.824 --> 18:44.778
Ginny dumped Rudy.
He's her new fiancÃ©.

18:44.952 --> 18:46.695
Mike, stop it.

18:46.870 --> 18:50.204
Sam, could you help
the grandmothers with supper?

18:50.374 --> 18:53.743
Dad and I have to go to dinner
with the Rice-czyk's.

18:53.919 --> 18:56.291
- Ryszczyk's.
- Ryszczyk's.

18:57.548 --> 19:01.877
Do you think there's any reason
I should stay home tonight?

19:02.052 --> 19:06.263
It might be nice to visit with
your grandparents and Long Duk Dong.

19:06.431 --> 19:07.431
Who?

19:08.307 --> 19:11.178
The weird Chinese guy in Mike's room.

19:11.352 --> 19:14.768
- I think I have a dance to go to.
- That's OK.

19:16.858 --> 19:19.894
Can you remember to turn off
the stove in 20 minutes?

19:20.069 --> 19:22.607
I can remember lots of things.

19:27.702 --> 19:32.030
- This is the worst day of my life.
- What are you bitching about?

19:32.205 --> 19:36.583
I have to sleep under some Chinaman
named after a duck's dork.

19:36.752 --> 19:40.452
- Where am I sleeping?
- Sofa City, sweetheart.

19:46.136 --> 19:49.422
Do you think Grandpa Fred's
going to embarrass me?

19:49.598 --> 19:52.433
Why not?
He does it to everyone else.

19:52.601 --> 19:57.179
He already asked me if Rudy
was the oily variety bohunk.

19:57.355 --> 19:58.555
Is he?

19:59.440 --> 20:01.479
Don't be cute.

20:01.650 --> 20:04.188
I really love Rudy.

20:04.361 --> 20:07.695
And he is totally enamoured of me.

20:09.408 --> 20:12.991
I mean I've had men
who have loved me before,

20:13.162 --> 20:15.783
but not for six months in a row.

20:15.956 --> 20:17.996
I think I'm in love.

20:18.167 --> 20:20.836
So, how long have you been in love?

20:21.921 --> 20:24.957
Well, it hasn't really happened yet.

20:25.132 --> 20:27.088
So what's the deal?

20:28.385 --> 20:31.339
I'm not sure that he knows I exist.

20:32.764 --> 20:36.049
Sam, I really don't have time for this.

20:37.560 --> 20:41.640
I'm sorry! I always listen to you
talk about your boyfriends.

20:41.815 --> 20:45.100
Darling, is something bothering you?

20:49.155 --> 20:56.284
You're really acting like an asshole.
And I think I know what it is.

20:56.453 --> 21:02.326
You're jealous that I'm getting married
and that I'm getting all the attention.

21:03.627 --> 21:07.839
Everybody in this family
has gone totally "Outer Limits".

21:08.006 --> 21:13.593
No, Sam. I think you're just being
a little selfish and immature.

21:15.597 --> 21:20.140
Oh, yes. That's it. That's exactly it.

21:23.104 --> 21:27.433
Unbelievable. Make someone
a bridesmaid and they shit all over you.

21:37.827 --> 21:39.784
Very clever dinner.

21:39.954 --> 21:44.581
Appetising food fitting neatly
into interesting round pie.

21:44.751 --> 21:46.708
It's a quiche.

21:46.878 --> 21:50.744
- How do you spell it?
- You don't spell it, son. You eat it.

21:53.258 --> 21:56.425
Dong has only been in our country
a short time, Fred.

21:56.595 --> 21:59.133
I think we can all help him assimilate.

22:00.223 --> 22:05.384
Long Duk Dong is your age, Sam.
You two should have a lot to chat about.

22:05.562 --> 22:09.690
I love visiting
with Grandma and Grandpa

22:09.858 --> 22:12.064
and writing letters to parents

22:12.235 --> 22:18.486
and pushing the lawn mowing machine
so Grandpa's hyena don't get disturbed.

22:18.657 --> 22:20.057
Hernia.

22:21.744 --> 22:28.078
Yes, indeed. He does the dishes
and helps with the laundry, you betcha.

22:31.504 --> 22:34.255
- May I be excused?
- Where are you going?

22:35.466 --> 22:38.337
I have dance to go to at school.

22:39.512 --> 22:44.303
It's a very important dance.
We're being graded on it for Gym.

22:44.474 --> 22:47.677
Wait a minute, I have a wonderful idea.

22:48.770 --> 22:51.724
Would you like to go
to the dance with Sam?

23:15.462 --> 23:17.122
I wonder if Jake is here.

23:17.297 --> 23:20.749
Don't get jacked up about a guy
that isn't a thing yet.

23:20.926 --> 23:24.212
If you don't have anything
you don't have anything to lose.

23:24.388 --> 23:28.255
That's cheerful!
Let's go make ourselves available.

23:45.783 --> 23:49.532
- That's the one, dude.
- She doesn't look like a freshman.

23:49.704 --> 23:54.200
Sophomore, dude. Sophomore.
Fully-aged sophomore meat.

23:57.295 --> 23:59.667
- We do the bus.
- Have you talked to her?

23:59.839 --> 24:03.706
Talk? Dude, I have
a relationship with her.

24:05.136 --> 24:09.049
- You are such a liar.
- We'll see about that, my man.

24:09.222 --> 24:13.719
By night's end
I predict me and her will interface.

24:18.357 --> 24:22.057
~ <i>Huh huh huh hu-uh huh</i> ~

24:28.116 --> 24:31.900
~ <i>Huh huh huh hu-uh huh</i> ~

24:32.079 --> 24:38.469
~ <i>I know this much is true</i> ~

24:38.569 --> 24:41.707
~ <i>Huh huh huh hu-uh huh...</i> ~

24:42.922 --> 24:44.879
Check it out.

24:47.593 --> 24:50.298
<i>Pretty intense, huh? Over.</i>

25:04.693 --> 25:08.690
All right. I knew you would come around.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.520
Christ!

25:13.118 --> 25:15.276
Crank that, sister.

25:24.379 --> 25:27.878
Very hot, very hot.
This night is happening.

25:33.846 --> 25:36.515
I'm blowing your mind, aren't I?

25:37.975 --> 25:40.513
I'm just getting warmed up.

26:30.150 --> 26:32.985
Way to go, dickface. She took off.

26:33.153 --> 26:36.736
Don't spaz out.
The situation will come online.

26:36.907 --> 26:40.821
I'll bet you a dozen floppy disks
you don't even get tit.

26:40.994 --> 26:43.319
You got a bet, scumbag. Get it on.

26:43.497 --> 26:47.115
Take off.
You wouldn't be able to prove it anyway.

26:47.292 --> 26:52.535
A, don't hit me. Secondly,
what kind of proof do you want?

26:52.714 --> 26:53.914
Video.

26:54.298 --> 26:59.256
No way. I could see it getting duped
and winding up on cable somewhere.

26:59.428 --> 27:01.337
Try again.

27:01.514 --> 27:03.506
Underpants.

27:05.643 --> 27:08.050
No problem, buttlick.

27:16.696 --> 27:18.688
Girls' underpants.

27:22.033 --> 27:25.153
~ <i>She's got her layered hair</i>
<i>And her flared jeans</i> ~

27:25.328 --> 27:27.997
~ <i>You know what that means?</i>
<i>She's just a little queen</i> ~

27:28.164 --> 27:30.371
~ <i>She shares your London flat</i> ~

27:30.542 --> 27:33.412
~ <i>She thinks that London's where it's at</i> ~

27:33.586 --> 27:36.291
~ <i>Although it stinks</i>
<i>and when it rains you wear your hat</i> ~

27:36.464 --> 27:40.165
~ <i>And your plum coloured PVC</i>
<i>wet look maxi-mac</i> ~

27:40.343 --> 27:42.834
~ <i>You tie your ginger hair back in a bun</i> ~

27:43.012 --> 27:47.141
~ <i>You're the ugliest creature</i>
<i>under the sun...</i> ~

27:49.476 --> 27:52.311
- So what's your name?
- Dong.

27:53.897 --> 27:56.435
- What's your first name?
- Long.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.400
What's your middle name?

28:00.571 --> 28:01.571
Duk.

28:04.450 --> 28:08.530
I bet all the boys
chase you plenty in school.

28:08.704 --> 28:10.495
Nobody has caught me yet.

28:10.664 --> 28:12.538
I bet you are a big teaser.

28:12.708 --> 28:16.291
No, I can run the 40 in five flat.

28:17.462 --> 28:18.462
Flat?

28:22.550 --> 28:23.550
Hey.

28:24.343 --> 28:28.293
I'm really sorry.
Whatever I did was an accident.

28:28.473 --> 28:29.673
Relax.

28:35.188 --> 28:38.023
You were dancing with a girl...

28:39.108 --> 28:43.355
Oh, man. I'm really sorry.
I must have been on drugs. I...

28:43.529 --> 28:45.438
Do you know her?

28:45.614 --> 28:48.947
She grabbed me. I'm innocent.
Is she yours?

28:49.117 --> 28:51.074
What do you know about her?

28:51.244 --> 28:54.993
She has smallish tits, a decent voice.

28:55.165 --> 28:58.368
Smells pretty good.
She drives me crazy.

28:58.543 --> 29:01.248
- Did she come here with you?
- No.

29:01.421 --> 29:05.205
But if it's OK with my dad,
she's going home with me.

29:05.384 --> 29:07.091
Excuse me.

29:16.852 --> 29:19.225
Do you want
to blow off this dance?

29:19.397 --> 29:22.848
- I am bored of break-up insanity.
- And go where?

29:23.025 --> 29:25.812
Well, Jake's parents aren't home.

29:25.986 --> 29:28.904
- How is it going?
- Fine.

29:29.073 --> 29:32.323
Jake's paranoid about
his house getting trashed.

29:32.493 --> 29:33.693
Again.

29:36.664 --> 29:39.866
~ <i>The hours I spend investigating</i> ~

29:40.041 --> 29:43.956
~ <i>A way of living with no misgiving</i> ~

29:44.129 --> 29:49.129
~ <i>I yearn for it</i> ~

30:03.982 --> 30:04.982
OK

30:12.948 --> 30:15.866
Try and get a little bit lower.

30:22.499 --> 30:24.373
Yes, I'm back.

30:24.543 --> 30:26.452
So I smell.

30:26.628 --> 30:30.792
That's my shaving cream.
Want to feel a clean, close shave?

30:30.966 --> 30:34.750
I'll pass.
Couldn't find anyone else to bug?

30:34.928 --> 30:37.715
You know you're the one
I want to bug.

30:37.889 --> 30:42.183
This is my friend Randy
and that's Jimmy Montrose.

30:42.352 --> 30:44.012
- This is Farmer Fred.
- Ted.

30:44.187 --> 30:48.599
- I'm sorry. This is Farmer Ted.
- I'm not a farmer, I'm a freshman.

30:48.775 --> 30:53.567
- Geek, can I be honest with you?
- Not if you're going to insult me.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.904
- Shoot.
- Get the hell out of here.

31:00.078 --> 31:02.746
Nice manners, babe.

31:02.913 --> 31:05.700
She's totally serious, asswipe.

31:05.874 --> 31:07.074
Chill.

31:13.423 --> 31:15.463
Do you want to split with me?

31:17.552 --> 31:20.222
- My mum tells me...
- I can't handle this.

31:20.389 --> 31:23.758
...if you want something
you gotta ask for it.

31:23.934 --> 31:28.928
It's embarrassing for me.
I don't know. It's just...

32:16.109 --> 32:19.026
I'm sorry about what happened
in the gym.

32:19.195 --> 32:21.769
I had no idea you couldn't dance.

32:48.265 --> 32:51.966
- What a decent night, huh?
- It's my birthday.

32:55.855 --> 32:58.144
~ <i>You say it's your birthday</i> ~

32:58.316 --> 33:00.355
~ <i>It's my birthday too...</i> ~

33:00.526 --> 33:02.566
Don't do that, OK?

33:04.113 --> 33:05.940
~ <i>Hey Jude...</i> ~

33:06.115 --> 33:10.576
Just stop it, OK.
It's really been a shitty birthday for me.

33:10.745 --> 33:13.829
No offence, but I don't need a serenade.

33:13.998 --> 33:17.118
- You didn't get anything good?
- I didn't get shit.

33:17.293 --> 33:22.001
Not even a "happy birthday".
My whole family blew it off.

33:24.383 --> 33:26.671
I'd freak if my family forgot.

33:26.843 --> 33:29.631
I'm 16.
Everything should be platinum.

33:29.805 --> 33:32.924
- I should be happy, right? Right?
- Yeah.

33:33.100 --> 33:34.808
Well, I can't get happy.

33:34.976 --> 33:39.021
It is physically impossible
for me to get happy.

33:41.650 --> 33:45.268
Would you feel better
if you knew one of my secrets?

33:45.445 --> 33:49.774
- Don't gross me out.
- No, we're not talking gross.

33:49.949 --> 33:51.988
It's just embarrassing.

33:58.332 --> 34:03.409
This cannot leave this room. It would
devastate my reputation as a dude.

34:04.714 --> 34:06.671
No problem.

34:11.387 --> 34:13.925
I've never bagged a babe.

34:16.683 --> 34:19.054
I'm not a stud.

34:22.147 --> 34:28.065
I got the rep in sixth grade.
It stuck with me. I'm still on hold.

34:30.237 --> 34:33.322
Look, I'd appreciate
you not laughing. OK?

34:33.491 --> 34:35.235
I'm sorry.

34:36.411 --> 34:39.447
That's not what I meant.

34:41.541 --> 34:43.083
I meant...

34:44.960 --> 34:47.581
Back off, Junior.

34:50.341 --> 34:52.297
Pardon me.

34:56.972 --> 34:58.572
It's OK.

35:03.270 --> 35:08.181
I meant that it's OK you did it once.
I didn't mean for you to do it again.

35:09.234 --> 35:11.026
I'm sorry.

35:12.111 --> 35:13.311
Sorry.

35:15.948 --> 35:18.902
Just now I really felt
how much you liked me.

35:20.661 --> 35:24.445
You're probably zoning in
on my brainwaves.

35:24.624 --> 35:27.329
Not really, I felt it on my leg.

35:29.212 --> 35:31.833
Come on. I don't want to see it.

35:36.969 --> 35:39.258
Sorry if I embarrassed you.

35:39.430 --> 35:41.552
I'm not embarrassed.

35:41.723 --> 35:44.760
Fresh breath is a priority in my life.

35:47.354 --> 35:51.601
I don't want to hurt you.
It's human of you to listen to my bullshit.

35:51.775 --> 35:54.017
I care about it. Really.

35:55.195 --> 35:59.407
I know I came on like a poosa
on the bus tonight and everything,

35:59.574 --> 36:03.275
but that's just so my friends
won't think I'm a jerk.

36:03.453 --> 36:07.402
But they're all pretty much jerks though,
aren't they?

36:07.581 --> 36:10.582
The thing is I'm kind of like the leader.

36:10.751 --> 36:12.874
Like the king of the dipshits.

36:13.045 --> 36:14.954
Well that's pretty cool.

36:15.131 --> 36:17.207
A lot can happen over a year.

36:17.383 --> 36:21.048
You could come back next fall
as a normal person.

36:21.220 --> 36:22.928
- Yeah?
- Sure.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.639
Would it be totally off the wall if...

36:31.814 --> 36:35.147
...I asked if I could have sex with you?

36:37.318 --> 36:41.186
You asking is not as off the wall
as why I won't.

36:41.364 --> 36:43.658
- VD?
- No.

36:44.909 --> 36:47.827
I'm sort of saving myself.

36:47.996 --> 36:51.447
It's really stupid,
he doesn't even know I exist.

36:51.624 --> 36:52.624
Who?

36:54.044 --> 36:55.044
WHO?

36:56.629 --> 36:58.040
Jake Ryan.

36:59.049 --> 37:01.041
You like Jake?

37:01.217 --> 37:03.174
Jake's my boy.

37:03.344 --> 37:06.547
I just talked to Jake.
He asked me about you.

37:06.722 --> 37:08.715
- He did not.
- He did too.

37:08.891 --> 37:10.848
He asked what you were like.

37:11.018 --> 37:14.387
If you're lying
I'll beat the crap out of you.

37:14.563 --> 37:18.098
- I'm not lying.
- Oh, my God. What should I do?

37:18.275 --> 37:22.143
Should I say, "Hi Jake, I'm Samantha",
or let him come to me?

37:22.321 --> 37:23.981
Not my department.

37:24.156 --> 37:27.940
What if I let him come to me
but he forgets? Or changes his mind.

37:28.118 --> 37:30.241
Then I'm totally screwed, right?

37:30.411 --> 37:32.320
Apparently so.

37:32.497 --> 37:35.367
What would you do if you were me?

37:36.334 --> 37:40.545
I'm a gambling man by nature
and I'd go for it.

37:42.215 --> 37:46.426
This is so strange but I think I will.
Oh, you're the best.

37:49.013 --> 37:50.413
Wait...

37:50.598 --> 37:53.385
- What?
- Know anything about floppy disks?

37:53.559 --> 37:56.395
We'll talk about this on the bus, OK?

37:56.562 --> 37:58.471
I've got kind of a problem.

37:58.647 --> 38:03.475
Floppy disks are pretty expensive
and I made a bet with my friends -

38:03.652 --> 38:05.810
the dipshits.

38:06.988 --> 38:09.314
I bet them I'd do it with you.

38:09.491 --> 38:13.703
Before I knew you.
I can get proof without getting physical.

38:13.870 --> 38:19.576
- How?
- Can I borrow your underpants?

38:30.886 --> 38:34.338
It's time to blow this off
and go to your house.

38:34.515 --> 38:37.433
I told Tracy and Robin
to come to your house.

38:37.601 --> 38:42.180
I told them not to tell anybody. I love it
when your parents are out of town.

38:42.356 --> 38:47.695
I fantasize I'm your wife and we're
the richest, most popular adults in town.

38:47.862 --> 38:50.150
I owe all my great weekends to you.

38:52.324 --> 38:54.612
- What's your problem?
- What?

38:54.784 --> 38:57.358
You've been acting weird all night.

38:57.537 --> 39:00.988
- Are you screwing around?
- Me? Are you crazy?

39:01.166 --> 39:04.866
I don't know, Jake.
I'm getting strange signals.

39:05.045 --> 39:09.920
They're not coming from me.
Everything's fine. Don't have a cow.

39:10.967 --> 39:16.472
Just remember one thing. I can name
20 guys who would kill to love me.

39:16.639 --> 39:19.925
- Is that a threat?
- It's a fact, Jake.

39:20.977 --> 39:25.722
Come on, before we get in
a big wicked fight, let's get out of here.

39:28.776 --> 39:31.693
Hi, Jake, I'm Samantha. How's it going?

39:34.740 --> 39:36.733
Do you got a cigarette?

39:40.579 --> 39:45.371
This may sound dumb, but I love you
and I'll do anything to make you love me.

39:47.169 --> 39:49.125
I love your shirt.

39:53.508 --> 39:59.261
Jake, you won't believe this but I had
this bizarre dream and you were in it.

40:05.561 --> 40:09.476
For the last time. I'm not going
to tell you again. Act like a man.

40:09.649 --> 40:11.641
I want to be with you guys.

40:19.825 --> 40:21.864
~ <i>Oh! Ha!</i> ~

40:25.247 --> 40:29.494
~ <i>You oh-oh</i>
<i>are my desire</i> ~

40:30.877 --> 40:34.543
~ <i>You</i>
<i>you make me cry</i> ~

40:36.717 --> 40:41.592
~ <i>You oh-oh</i>
<i>are my desire</i> ~

40:41.763 --> 40:46.508
~ <i>Oh baby you you you</i>
<i>you make me cry</i> ~

40:48.477 --> 40:51.229
~ <i>Got to find you</i>
<i>know you're out there...</i> ~

40:52.815 --> 40:55.436
I can't believe I'm such a jerk.

40:56.569 --> 40:58.645
He smiles at me and I say nothing.

41:00.656 --> 41:03.776
And I can't believe
I gave my panties to a geek.

41:08.080 --> 41:10.369
- What year are you?
- Freshman.

41:10.541 --> 41:13.327
Give me a buck. Get in.

41:26.931 --> 41:28.342
Shut up.

41:29.768 --> 41:30.968
Bryce.

41:31.561 --> 41:34.561
Ted. Go for it.

41:53.916 --> 42:00.286
Hey, listen, I want to thank you
for loaning me the Donger.

42:03.884 --> 42:05.675
He's really bitchin'.

42:05.844 --> 42:09.177
That's OK, you guys
make a great couple.

42:11.432 --> 42:14.350
I've never been so happy
in my whole life.

42:14.519 --> 42:15.799
You maniac!

42:17.980 --> 42:20.554
Now I have a place to put my hand.

42:21.609 --> 42:26.022
So basically, Jimmy, my business
is video game arcades...

42:27.323 --> 42:31.107
...laundry, cigarette machines
and trucking.

42:32.203 --> 42:36.116
I dabble a little bit
in personal loans and politics.

42:40.877 --> 42:42.288
Very nice.

42:43.880 --> 42:47.415
All that really matters
is that the kids are happy together.

42:48.468 --> 42:51.138
Just as long as
my beautiful boy remembers

42:51.304 --> 42:54.555
that marrying means
he's out of the girl of the month club.

42:54.725 --> 43:00.229
Hey, wait a minute, I can still look.
I just can't touch. Right?

43:01.398 --> 43:03.306
- Oh, sensitive.
- Rudy.

43:07.069 --> 43:09.062
- Cheers.
- Right on.

43:12.783 --> 43:14.859
You do shots? Come on, wolf it.

43:31.509 --> 43:34.676
Good night, Marlene.
See you later, Dong.

43:34.846 --> 43:38.345
Sammy, tell Grandpa not to wait up.
Let's go boogie.

43:38.516 --> 43:39.516
Sure.

43:42.479 --> 43:44.970
Donger's here five hours
and he's got somebody.

43:45.148 --> 43:47.604
I live here my whole life
and I'm like a disease.

44:33.569 --> 44:37.104
Everybody, I'd like you
to meet my boyfriend, Jake.

44:38.199 --> 44:41.366
Jake, this is... everybody.

44:41.536 --> 44:43.991
Check it out.

44:44.163 --> 44:47.081
All right, whose is this?

44:48.001 --> 44:49.578
Such a poop.

45:23.492 --> 45:24.492
Woof!

45:48.351 --> 45:50.722
Ted. That's my mum.

45:50.894 --> 45:53.848
Change your frequency.
Don't be such a wimp.

45:59.778 --> 46:02.269
Take those ridiculous things off, OK.

46:03.907 --> 46:05.650
Will you guys grow up?

46:05.825 --> 46:09.444
Ted, won't we get pounded
if we go to a Senior party?

46:10.121 --> 46:13.573
We've got 70 dollars
and a pair of girl's underpants.

46:13.750 --> 46:15.956
We're as safe as kittens, OK?

46:16.127 --> 46:20.206
This is a great social opportunity
for us. Come on.

46:31.976 --> 46:34.383
- Do not embarrass me.
- For sure, we won't.

46:35.521 --> 46:38.854
- Will you fix your hair, Bryce.
- I already did.

46:40.484 --> 46:42.560
Close your bone, all right.

46:45.196 --> 46:47.189
- And be polite to his parents.
- OK.

46:52.912 --> 46:57.740
Hey, come on in.
The party's hot, dude, person.

47:01.963 --> 47:04.833
He's from out of town.
He speaks English, right?

47:05.008 --> 47:08.875
- Don't be such faggots.
- Man, shut up. Kidding, sorry.

47:12.139 --> 47:14.760
- You think we're gonna die?
- Definitely.

47:33.368 --> 47:36.571
- Did you put the cat out?
- We don't have a cat.

47:36.747 --> 47:38.704
Come on, damn it, answer.

47:48.924 --> 47:50.882
Oh, eat me.

47:53.637 --> 47:54.966
Who is it?

47:56.807 --> 47:58.765
Well, what did they want?

48:00.811 --> 48:01.811
Sex.

48:10.236 --> 48:11.236
Geek.

48:23.458 --> 48:24.869
Very nice!

48:25.043 --> 48:28.957
We're here five minutes
and... I'm at a loss.

48:31.925 --> 48:33.882
Real smooth, Cliff!

48:42.977 --> 48:46.926
You know, I've never been out
with a boy before.

48:47.106 --> 48:48.897
Me neither.

48:57.449 --> 49:02.407
Jake? Where are you, Jake?

49:03.454 --> 49:06.574
Jakey, have you stopped loving me?

49:09.544 --> 49:11.501
Leave me alone.

49:22.682 --> 49:23.682
What?

49:25.268 --> 49:28.851
- I'm sorry, I don't do that.
- Yes you do.

49:29.022 --> 49:31.346
- I know.
- Come on.

49:31.523 --> 49:35.817
Trace! You guys,
can you help me please?

49:35.986 --> 49:38.903
- Oh, shit.
- I'm your prom queen.

49:41.033 --> 49:44.033
Trace, you guys, I'm serious.
Come on, I need help.

49:45.120 --> 49:47.160
I need help, too!

49:47.331 --> 49:50.616
- What's the problem?
- Several things.

49:55.380 --> 49:59.128
OK, we'll help. No problem.

49:59.300 --> 50:01.209
Don't go away, Caroline baby.

50:07.433 --> 50:09.675
Hello. Hello?

50:10.853 --> 50:13.973
Listen, I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

50:18.736 --> 50:20.147
Yes. Hello, sir...

50:20.321 --> 50:24.782
Are you the bugger that's been
calling here all night and hanging up?

50:24.950 --> 50:28.899
Could you tell me if there is
a Samantha Baker there and if so,

50:29.079 --> 50:30.905
may I converse with her briefly?

50:31.081 --> 50:34.913
Yes it is, and no you may not.

50:36.127 --> 50:38.037
Might I leave a message, sir?

50:39.589 --> 50:41.582
He wants to leave a message for Sam.

50:42.676 --> 50:44.834
Give me that phone.

50:46.346 --> 50:48.255
Now you listen to me, mister.

50:48.431 --> 50:50.258
God did not put me on this earth

50:50.433 --> 50:55.011
to be awakened by filthy suggestions
from a foul-mouthed hooligan like you.

50:55.187 --> 50:56.930
As for our granddaughter,

50:57.106 --> 51:00.557
I'm sure that she has enough sense
to stay clear of you.

51:00.734 --> 51:02.691
Now good night and goodbye.

51:08.367 --> 51:09.778
That was great!

51:09.952 --> 51:12.324
Sam's lucky she has us, Howard.

51:12.496 --> 51:17.656
Yeah, even if she doesn't appreciate us.

51:18.961 --> 51:22.660
- You promise you won't get mad?
- No, I love you.

51:22.839 --> 51:25.294
OK, close your eyes.

51:26.384 --> 51:27.984
Scalpel.

51:39.188 --> 51:41.347
Oh, my God!

51:44.402 --> 51:47.569
That was wonderful.
I'm so proud of you.

51:47.739 --> 51:50.063
I don't know how to thank you enough.

51:50.240 --> 51:52.316
My pleasure.

52:06.006 --> 52:09.090
- My God!
- Wow.

52:09.259 --> 52:12.046
I hope they have insurance.

53:15.322 --> 53:17.279
What a disaster.

53:43.558 --> 53:44.558
Jake.

53:47.228 --> 53:48.228
Sam?

53:49.981 --> 53:51.261
Sweetheart?

53:53.526 --> 53:55.684
- Daddy?
- Hi, kiddo.

53:57.113 --> 54:00.316
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Everything's fine.

54:01.701 --> 54:04.655
I was just upstairs and I couldn't sleep.

54:06.956 --> 54:09.162
I feel like a real jerk, honey.

54:11.084 --> 54:13.456
We forgot your birthday.

54:16.089 --> 54:20.383
- I bet you're really P.O.'d?
- No, it's OK.

54:21.553 --> 54:23.546
I'm not all that upset any more.

54:25.474 --> 54:29.174
This wedding is really turning
this entire house inside out

54:29.353 --> 54:32.852
and I just came down
to tell you that we did remember.

54:34.775 --> 54:36.565
Thanks, Dad.

54:37.693 --> 54:39.104
Happy Birthday.

54:49.997 --> 54:51.954
Is something else wrong?

54:53.668 --> 54:55.043
No, why?

54:55.211 --> 54:59.789
I get the feeling that something's
bothering you, other than your birthday.

55:00.675 --> 55:03.628
No, I'm fine. Really.

55:08.723 --> 55:10.467
I think I know what it is.

55:13.687 --> 55:15.478
It has to do with a certain guy?

55:23.113 --> 55:24.737
I know, honey.

55:28.785 --> 55:32.034
We're all upset that Ginny's
marrying a bohunk.

55:37.668 --> 55:39.043
What's the matter?

55:41.088 --> 55:43.793
- I meant Jake.
- Jake?

55:45.134 --> 55:47.007
Wait, she said his name was Rudy.

55:47.177 --> 55:50.262
- Forget it.
- Forget what? Who's Jake?

55:53.809 --> 55:57.889
He's a boy, Daddy. It's nothing.
Just forget it, please.

55:58.063 --> 56:00.019
Sam, we're not communicating.

56:01.816 --> 56:04.188
It's extremely embarrassing, OK?

56:05.069 --> 56:06.813
What's embarrassing?

56:06.988 --> 56:10.523
Sitting with your dad,
telling him about your love life.

56:12.201 --> 56:14.443
I'm afraid you lost me again, Sam.

56:17.206 --> 56:20.990
Jake is a Senior.
He's beautiful and perfect.

56:21.169 --> 56:23.838
I like him a real lot
and he doesn't like me, OK?

56:27.090 --> 56:29.249
He's got this incredible girlfriend.

56:29.426 --> 56:32.925
I'm just this dork that's following him
around like a puppy.

56:33.096 --> 56:34.888
Why do you think you're a dork?

56:35.057 --> 56:38.260
I don't think you're a dork,
neither does Mum.

56:38.435 --> 56:41.886
- Mike thinks I'm a dork.
- Mike is a dork.

56:42.814 --> 56:44.357
So am I.

56:44.524 --> 56:47.276
Well, if it's any consolation, I love you.

56:48.111 --> 56:51.860
If this guy can't see in you
the beautiful things that I see...

56:53.033 --> 56:55.357
...then he's got the problem.

56:55.534 --> 57:00.659
- I know, it just hurts.
- That's why they call them crushes.

57:01.749 --> 57:05.829
If they were easy
they'd call them something else.

57:06.671 --> 57:10.004
If I were Ginny, I'd have this guy
crawling on his knees.

57:10.174 --> 57:12.879
Let me tell you something about Ginny.

57:13.052 --> 57:17.513
I love her as much as I love you
but she's a different person.

57:17.682 --> 57:19.639
Sometimes I worry about her.

57:19.809 --> 57:24.635
When you're given things easily
you don't always appreciate them.

57:25.772 --> 57:28.014
With you I'm not worried.

57:28.191 --> 57:32.058
When it happens to you, Samantha,
it will be forever.

57:36.908 --> 57:42.068
Well, I don't think I'll be able to sleep
if I don't feel this talk has helped you.

57:42.247 --> 57:46.909
- So would you be a sport and lie to me?
- Yeah sure, Daddy.

57:48.211 --> 57:50.831
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night.

57:57.469 --> 58:00.885
- One more thing, sweetheart.
- What?

58:01.056 --> 58:04.508
When you do find the right guy,
don't let him boss you around.

58:06.228 --> 58:10.178
Make sure he knows
you wear the pants in the family.

58:14.028 --> 58:16.697
- These are really hers?
- Yeah.

58:16.863 --> 58:19.780
- How did you get them?
- She gave them to me.

58:20.867 --> 58:22.326
Did you...

58:22.493 --> 58:26.028
No, Jake. She's cranked for you.

58:26.205 --> 58:30.286
I told her you asked about her, right.
The girl freaked. She had a hissy.

58:30.460 --> 58:33.377
- She thinks you're the cat's meow.
- Really?

58:33.546 --> 58:38.374
She came up to me in the gym tonight.
She looked at me like I was a leper.

58:38.551 --> 58:40.425
Girls will do that, Jake.

58:40.595 --> 58:43.168
They know that guys
are in perpetual heat.

58:43.348 --> 58:48.970
They enjoy pumping us up.
It's pure power politics.

58:49.144 --> 58:51.302
I thought she hated my guts.

58:51.480 --> 58:56.307
Games, Jake. Silly torturous games.
Sometimes I go without lunch

58:56.485 --> 58:58.892
because some bitch
borrows my lunch money.

58:59.071 --> 59:01.644
Any halfway decent girl can rob me blind.

59:01.823 --> 59:04.030
Because I'm too torqued up to say no.

59:04.201 --> 59:06.407
It's heinous, I'm telling you.

59:06.578 --> 59:08.571
You better not be dicking me around.

59:08.747 --> 59:12.578
It'd be a downer to get together
and find out she thinks I'm a slime.

59:12.750 --> 59:14.743
Jake, would I dick you?

59:16.128 --> 59:20.078
Let me put it to you this way -
what happens to me if I dick you?

59:21.467 --> 59:25.844
- I'd kick your ass.
- Right. So why would I lie?

59:26.639 --> 59:31.135
But if all you want off the girl
is a piece of ass

59:31.310 --> 59:35.853
I'll either do it myself or get someone
bigger than me to kick your ass.

59:37.441 --> 59:41.568
Not many girls in contemporary
American society today

59:41.736 --> 59:44.821
would give their underwear
to help a geek like me.

59:45.824 --> 59:47.816
I can get ass anytime I want.

59:47.993 --> 59:51.362
Caroline's in the bedroom right now
passed out cold.

59:51.538 --> 59:55.452
I could violate her ten different ways
if I wanted to.

59:55.625 --> 59:57.950
- What are you waiting for?
- I don't know.

59:58.128 --> 01:00:01.331
She's beautiful and she's built
and all that.

01:00:01.506 --> 01:00:03.831
I'm just not interested anymore.

01:00:04.592 --> 01:00:07.509
- Does that really matter, guy?
- Yeah, it matters.

01:00:07.678 --> 01:00:12.139
She's totally insensitive.
Look what she did to my house.

01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:14.425
She doesn't know shit about love.

01:00:14.601 --> 01:00:19.145
The only thing she cares about is
partying. I want a serious girlfriend.

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:22.766
Somebody I can love,
that's gonna love me back.

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:26.110
Is that psycho?

01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:30.115
That's beautiful, Jake.

01:00:30.284 --> 01:00:32.442
A ton of guys feel the same way you do.

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:34.659
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:38.827
They just don't have the balls
to admit it. They're wimps.

01:00:39.876 --> 01:00:42.248
Samantha is really special.

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:44.329
I'll make a deal with you.

01:00:44.505 --> 01:00:49.167
You let me keep these,
I'll let you take Caroline home.

01:00:49.344 --> 01:00:51.301
Make sure she gets home.

01:00:51.471 --> 01:00:56.927
- Don't leave her in a parking lot. OK?
- Jake, I'm only a freshman.

01:00:57.101 --> 01:01:00.435
She's so blitzed
she won't know the difference.

01:01:00.605 --> 01:01:03.724
- Jake, I don't have a car.
- You can take mine.

01:01:03.899 --> 01:01:07.731
- Jake, I don't have a license.
- I trust you.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.740
Jake, I'd love to, I can't.
Want a pretzel?

01:01:15.911 --> 01:01:18.865
- You sure?
- Positive.

01:01:31.717 --> 01:01:33.793
- I got her.
- Yeah.

01:01:45.106 --> 01:01:47.775
- This is your car?
- No, this is my dad's car.

01:01:47.942 --> 01:01:50.433
You said you couldn't drive a stick.

01:01:50.611 --> 01:01:54.194
This is a mother...
This is a Rolls Royce, Jake.

01:01:55.366 --> 01:01:57.660
- So?
- So!

01:01:58.326 --> 01:02:01.031
I heard the grille alone
cost five grand on this.

01:02:01.204 --> 01:02:05.665
- Five grand. I don't have five grand.
- Then don't hit anything.

01:02:05.834 --> 01:02:09.416
- Don't hit anything.
- Do you want to do this or not?

01:02:09.587 --> 01:02:10.587
No.

01:02:14.134 --> 01:02:17.088
Who the hell? Who does he?

01:02:43.912 --> 01:02:46.285
- Who's he?
- That's me.

01:02:53.921 --> 01:02:55.998
- Who are you?
- I'm him.

01:03:02.555 --> 01:03:03.955
Oh. OK.

01:03:06.267 --> 01:03:09.387
- She's totally gone. Have fun.
- Thanks.

01:03:16.235 --> 01:03:19.486
- Jake, is your dad a big man?
- About six four.

01:03:19.656 --> 01:03:21.066
Very nice!

01:03:24.868 --> 01:03:25.868
Whoa!

01:03:34.294 --> 01:03:35.294
Easy.

01:03:37.214 --> 01:03:38.214
Easy.

01:03:56.482 --> 01:03:58.107
~ <i>Hey sucker!</i> ~

01:03:59.652 --> 01:04:01.691
~ <i>What the hell's got into you?</i> ~

01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:14.079
Oh, sexy girlfriend!

01:04:15.459 --> 01:04:16.859
Banzai.

01:05:02.671 --> 01:05:04.794
- Think they liked us?
- Definitely.

01:05:07.343 --> 01:05:11.423
Can we turn that music down?
I need to concentrate.

01:05:11.597 --> 01:05:14.301
Excuse me. Stop that.

01:05:14.474 --> 01:05:17.309
It looks like rain. Better put the top up.

01:05:17.477 --> 01:05:20.394
Will you stop that.
You could get us into trouble.

01:05:20.563 --> 01:05:22.355
This is a car.

01:05:23.775 --> 01:05:26.562
It probably doesn't have Triple A on it.

01:05:26.736 --> 01:05:29.309
Buckle up, pooh bear.

01:05:31.032 --> 01:05:34.982
I can't believe you're so popular
and you're acting like this.

01:05:37.538 --> 01:05:38.738
Hello?

01:05:39.248 --> 01:05:41.536
Oh, I don't know, I'll have to look.

01:05:41.708 --> 01:05:44.911
Mr Ryan are you in here?
Where are you?

01:05:45.087 --> 01:05:48.503
- Mr Ryan's not in right now.
- My Christmas present to you!

01:05:49.591 --> 01:05:51.963
- Thank you.
- No, you didn't see it.

01:05:52.135 --> 01:05:53.135
See.

01:05:55.764 --> 01:05:57.175
Thank you.

01:05:59.017 --> 01:06:01.473
Now we're both on the pill.

01:06:07.192 --> 01:06:09.148
You gave me a birth control pill.

01:06:09.318 --> 01:06:11.525
You know what that will do
to a guy my age?

01:06:11.696 --> 01:06:14.447
I know exactly what it will do
to a girl my age.

01:06:14.615 --> 01:06:17.023
My first time in a car
and you pull this shit.

01:06:17.201 --> 01:06:20.487
It makes it OK
to be really super careless.

01:06:27.169 --> 01:06:30.953
We're not going any further
until you stop these childish antics.

01:06:31.132 --> 01:06:33.005
Don't be such a poop.

01:06:34.844 --> 01:06:37.713
- On second thought...
- I love you.

01:06:42.559 --> 01:06:44.468
This is getting good.

01:06:48.398 --> 01:06:49.398
Whoa!

01:07:08.917 --> 01:07:12.915
- Ted, what the hell are you doing?
- Are those jocks back?

01:07:14.923 --> 01:07:17.593
- Cliff, do you have film in your camera?
- What?

01:07:18.886 --> 01:07:21.507
Take those ridiculous things off.

01:07:23.015 --> 01:07:25.588
- Do you have any film in your camera?
- Sure.

01:07:25.768 --> 01:07:28.603
Go get it and bring it outside.
Right out front.

01:07:28.771 --> 01:07:31.973
- What for?
- Just get it and come on out front, OK?

01:07:33.066 --> 01:07:35.105
- UFO?
- It's better.

01:07:36.194 --> 01:07:38.233
- Extraterrestrial?
- It's better.

01:07:38.404 --> 01:07:41.939
- Just get it and come outside.
- Female extraterrestrial?

01:07:43.034 --> 01:07:45.157
It's better.

01:07:45.328 --> 01:07:47.783
Better than a female extraterrestrial?

01:07:47.956 --> 01:07:51.040
- How do you tell if it's a female?
- It's got tits.

01:07:51.209 --> 01:07:54.210
- What makes them different?
- They've got four.

01:07:55.213 --> 01:07:58.497
Get the camera. It's in the closet.
Don't go in the closet.

01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:05.510
They're such assholes.

01:08:08.225 --> 01:08:10.182
Well, you should check that out.

01:08:10.352 --> 01:08:12.261
- Why do you have to argue?
- I'm not.

01:08:12.437 --> 01:08:14.311
- Yes you are.
- I am not.

01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:16.853
It's always bitch, bitch...

01:08:17.024 --> 01:08:19.397
Bitch is a female dog, and I'm not even.

01:08:19.569 --> 01:08:21.361
What's that supposed to mean?

01:08:22.406 --> 01:08:23.983
- Shit.
- Shoot.

01:08:41.381 --> 01:08:45.462
- Ted, that's a Rolls Royce.
- Ted, that's the prom queen.

01:08:45.636 --> 01:08:47.629
You got two girls in one night.

01:08:48.514 --> 01:08:51.005
- I told you I was hot.
- Hot? You're a legend.

01:08:51.183 --> 01:08:54.515
Will you shut up.
People around here work, all right?

01:08:55.604 --> 01:08:58.439
Hurry up,
I'm breaking 30 major laws here.

01:08:58.607 --> 01:09:01.310
Ted, nobody's gonna believe you.

01:09:05.613 --> 01:09:09.742
That, my friends,
is what the pictures are for. OK?

01:09:24.089 --> 01:09:25.881
Just get that, there.

01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:28.885
- Are you guys ready?
- Wait, hold on a second.

01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:35.881
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Just a minute.

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.385
- How does this look?
- Very nice.

01:09:38.562 --> 01:09:43.189
Wait a minute. Black and white
would capture the moment so nicely.

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:48.108
Would you take the picture.
You're pissing me off.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:53.279
- Smile, pumpkin.
- What?

01:09:53.451 --> 01:09:56.618
Oh, pictures. Cheers.

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:33.380
Marlene!

01:10:37.577 --> 01:10:39.369
Mike, go get dressed.

01:10:39.538 --> 01:10:42.823
I can't believe it.
Ginny's not in the shower.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.742
I wouldn't go in there.

01:10:44.917 --> 01:10:48.251
Grandpa Fred was in there
for half an hour. It's polluted.

01:10:48.421 --> 01:10:50.959
- Get dressed.
- It's your nose.

01:10:55.678 --> 01:10:57.089
They never listen.

01:10:57.263 --> 01:10:59.968
What was he wearing?

01:11:00.141 --> 01:11:06.309
Well, he was wearing
a red argyle sweater and tan trousers

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.722
and red shoes.

01:11:10.484 --> 01:11:11.943
No, he's not retarded.

01:11:12.111 --> 01:11:14.316
Now, what can I do to help?

01:11:14.487 --> 01:11:17.192
- You could finish the French toast.
- Good.

01:11:19.159 --> 01:11:23.026
- I'll just open the doughnuts.
- Good thinking.

01:11:23.204 --> 01:11:25.695
Oops, don't want to lose the nails.

01:11:31.379 --> 01:11:34.001
Well, I'll just wait until I hear from you.

01:11:34.174 --> 01:11:36.546
<i>VoilÃ !</i> ~ Breakfast is ready.

01:11:38.803 --> 01:11:44.592
Oh, Sam. I am so sorry
about your birthday.

01:11:45.976 --> 01:11:48.301
It's OK, I'll recover.

01:11:48.479 --> 01:11:50.518
It's important to you.

01:11:51.732 --> 01:11:55.481
And yesterday morning
you were trying to tell me.

01:11:55.653 --> 01:12:00.860
It's OK, Mum.
These things sometimes happen.

01:12:01.033 --> 01:12:04.532
Oh, honey, I just feel miserable.

01:12:04.703 --> 01:12:07.869
- You'll feel better.
- Who died?

01:12:11.751 --> 01:12:14.586
Is there something you want to say
to your sister?

01:12:14.754 --> 01:12:18.337
What? Are you kidding?
Where should I start?

01:12:18.508 --> 01:12:20.584
I mean about her birthday.

01:12:21.636 --> 01:12:23.427
It was yesterday. We all forgot.

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:26.800
Classic.

01:12:33.606 --> 01:12:35.812
Deep down he's really sorry.

01:12:39.695 --> 01:12:41.734
No, he's not.

01:12:42.739 --> 01:12:45.824
I have to go to this wedding
and look like Miss Princess

01:12:45.993 --> 01:12:48.032
in this dipshit's bridesmaid's dress.

01:12:48.203 --> 01:12:51.572
I don't have one tenth of the bod
to fill the stupid bust up.

01:12:51.748 --> 01:12:54.074
Should I waste myself
and spare the agony?

01:12:54.251 --> 01:12:58.118
I was gonna tell you something,
but maybe I shouldn't. It's bad.

01:12:58.297 --> 01:13:01.132
You may as well,
nothing could shock me any more.

01:13:03.259 --> 01:13:06.176
My brother paid a buck
to see your underwear.

01:13:10.141 --> 01:13:12.976
I hate that rock and roll rubbish.

01:13:13.144 --> 01:13:15.302
I'm afraid it's here to stay, Howie.

01:13:20.568 --> 01:13:23.604
Sam, you're dragging your dress honey.
Pick it up.

01:13:23.779 --> 01:13:27.563
- Come on, Ginny. Hurry up, sweetie.
- Why are you so slow?

01:13:27.742 --> 01:13:32.616
Do not fuss at your sister, it's her
wedding day. All right, is everybody in?

01:13:33.747 --> 01:13:35.786
Are you all right, Ginny?

01:13:35.957 --> 01:13:38.329
~ <i>Gee my life's a funny thing</i> ~

01:13:38.501 --> 01:13:40.541
~ <i>Am I still too young?</i> ~

01:13:41.755 --> 01:13:45.671
~ <i>All right</i> ~

01:13:45.771 --> 01:13:48.011
~ <i>She wants the young American</i> ~

01:13:48.178 --> 01:13:50.883
~ <i>Young American</i>
<i>young American</i> ~

01:13:51.056 --> 01:13:53.344
~ <i>She wants the young American</i> ~

01:13:53.516 --> 01:13:57.359
~ <i>All right</i> ~

01:13:57.459 --> 01:13:59.136
~ <i>She wants the young American</i> ~

01:13:59.313 --> 01:14:02.065
~ <i>Scanning life</i>
<i>through the picture windows</i> ~

01:14:02.232 --> 01:14:04.521
~ <i>She finds the slinky vagabond</i> ~

01:14:04.693 --> 01:14:07.813
~ <i>He coughs as he passes</i>
<i>her Ford Mustang</i> ~

01:14:07.988 --> 01:14:10.658
~ <i>But Heaven forbid, she'll take anything</i> ~

01:14:10.824 --> 01:14:13.742
~ <i>But the freak and his type</i>
<i>all for nothing</i> ~

01:14:13.911 --> 01:14:16.449
~ <i>He misses a step and cuts his hand</i> ~

01:14:16.622 --> 01:14:18.759
~ <i>But showing nothing</i>
<i>he swoops like a song...</i> ~

01:14:18.864 --> 01:14:20.989
- Howard, there's your Chinaman.
- Thanks, Fred.

01:14:21.168 --> 01:14:23.168
Bye, Dong.

01:14:23.963 --> 01:14:26.583
What's he doing
on the ground there?

01:14:26.756 --> 01:14:28.962
What's happened?

01:14:29.133 --> 01:14:32.965
- Put a mirror in front of his mouth.
- Howard, he's dead!

01:14:33.137 --> 01:14:36.341
Shit! I paid seven grand
for a wedding and I'll never see it.

01:14:36.516 --> 01:14:38.971
Watch your language, Mr Dirty Mouth.

01:14:40.728 --> 01:14:43.433
- Oh, thank God, he is still warm.
- Oh, good.

01:14:44.983 --> 01:14:46.809
Here, I'll help you, Howard.

01:14:50.613 --> 01:14:52.357
Canine cologne.

01:14:52.532 --> 01:14:57.489
Oh, no more yanky my wanky.
The Donger need food.

01:15:00.539 --> 01:15:05.664
Hell, he's three sheets to the wind.
He's drunk as a skunk.

01:15:05.836 --> 01:15:08.042
Oh, why don't you shut up, Fred.

01:15:08.213 --> 01:15:09.213
Dong.

01:15:11.592 --> 01:15:16.218
- Dong.
- Dong, Grandpa is talking to you.

01:15:18.599 --> 01:15:23.010
Dong, where is my automobile?

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.095
Automobile?

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:38.531
Lake. Big lake.

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:41.952
Why you little scuzzbag.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:48.460
Oh, my! Is everything all right?

01:15:48.628 --> 01:15:51.462
I was afraid you'd had an accident.

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:53.030
I wish.

01:15:54.758 --> 01:15:56.916
Her monthly bill came early.

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:02.924
Well, she's fine.
She just took a muscle relaxer.

01:16:03.099 --> 01:16:04.891
Try four.

01:16:05.602 --> 01:16:07.345
- You didn't?
- Mother.

01:16:27.081 --> 01:16:30.532
- Damn, Mum! I've got my headgear on.
- Will you wake up.

01:16:32.002 --> 01:16:34.576
Where the hell am I?

01:16:34.755 --> 01:16:38.171
I'll tell you where you are
if you tell me who you are.

01:16:40.219 --> 01:16:41.962
I'm Farmer Ted.

01:16:42.137 --> 01:16:46.845
You're in the parking lot
across the street from my church.

01:16:47.016 --> 01:16:48.808
You own a church?

01:16:54.107 --> 01:16:56.728
- What happened?
- I have no idea.

01:17:02.156 --> 01:17:04.315
Did I do that to your hair?

01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:07.902
At this point anything's possible.

01:17:19.006 --> 01:17:23.383
- Did we...
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

01:17:27.639 --> 01:17:32.218
Excuse me,
but do you know if I enjoyed it?

01:17:35.105 --> 01:17:37.561
Am I nuts, of course I enjoyed it.

01:17:37.733 --> 01:17:40.649
What I meant was, did you?

01:17:46.407 --> 01:17:48.945
I have this weird feeling I did.

01:17:58.753 --> 01:18:02.620
Here, Ginny, drink this. Come on.

01:18:05.468 --> 01:18:06.468
Here.

01:18:11.139 --> 01:18:16.264
- Wow, do I feel funky!
- Uh-huh.

01:18:35.288 --> 01:18:37.446
OK, I'm coming.

01:18:39.375 --> 01:18:43.242
Hello? Oh, this place is so confusing.

01:18:45.047 --> 01:18:46.047
OK.

01:18:55.933 --> 01:19:00.642
- Go away. I call police.
- Open the door.

01:19:00.813 --> 01:19:03.350
- No way, JosÃ©!
- Open the door.

01:19:03.523 --> 01:19:06.477
- You beat up my face.
- You grabbed my nuts.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:13.069
- That you?
- Yeah, that me.

01:19:15.285 --> 01:19:21.702
Oh, so sorry. I thought you
my new style American girlfriend.

01:19:21.874 --> 01:19:25.374
- Forget it, man. Just get Samantha.
- She not here.

01:19:25.545 --> 01:19:27.952
- Where is she?
- She got married.

01:19:28.131 --> 01:19:30.373
- What?
- She at the Church.

01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:32.838
She getting married to oily bohunk.

01:19:33.010 --> 01:19:35.417
- Married?
- Married.

01:19:35.596 --> 01:19:37.837
- Married?
- Yeah, married.

01:19:42.019 --> 01:19:46.063
- Married?
- Married. Jeez.

01:19:53.530 --> 01:19:55.653
Are you gonna be all right, sweetie?

01:19:55.824 --> 01:19:58.741
It's gonna be a piece of cake, Bren.

01:20:01.287 --> 01:20:04.371
Ginny, I'm really happy for you.

01:20:05.416 --> 01:20:07.989
I'm sorry for being kind of a jerk, lately.

01:20:09.503 --> 01:20:11.876
That's really lovely, Sam.

01:20:12.048 --> 01:20:14.336
I know you'll have a great marriage.

01:20:19.388 --> 01:20:20.588
Ginny!

01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:27.135
- Holy shit.
- She just had a cramp.

01:20:27.312 --> 01:20:30.064
I don't care. Look at her.

01:20:30.231 --> 01:20:35.474
Be quiet! We don't want
to announce that she's got her period.

01:20:35.654 --> 01:20:40.066
I guess those guys who thought we had
to get married feel really stupid now.

01:20:50.001 --> 01:20:53.121
~ <i>Here comes the bride...</i> ~

01:21:08.811 --> 01:21:11.017
Love the teapot.

01:21:20.364 --> 01:21:22.320
Could you move over.

01:21:25.785 --> 01:21:27.742
- Are you OK?
- I gotta rest.

01:21:27.912 --> 01:21:32.076
- What's the matter?
- Here comes the bride.

01:21:47.056 --> 01:21:48.856
I got it.

01:21:53.645 --> 01:21:56.645
Hi. I know you.

01:21:59.109 --> 01:22:02.063
I can't see with this thing on.

01:22:05.949 --> 01:22:10.658
I never went out with a freshman.
Not even when I was a freshman.

01:22:11.663 --> 01:22:14.783
- Me either.
- You were pretty crazy.

01:22:14.958 --> 01:22:18.207
- I was?
- Yeah.

01:22:19.754 --> 01:22:21.545
You know what I liked best?

01:22:21.714 --> 01:22:23.623
- My clean close shave?
- No.

01:22:26.302 --> 01:22:28.295
Waking up in your arms.

01:22:29.889 --> 01:22:31.846
These things?

01:22:36.938 --> 01:22:38.977
Shit. Jake.

01:22:39.148 --> 01:22:40.148
Jake.

01:22:43.069 --> 01:22:44.977
Holy shit.

01:22:51.243 --> 01:22:53.780
- Stay here, OK?
- Oh, my God.

01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:01.342
I'm dead.

01:23:10.512 --> 01:23:12.717
- Hello?
<i>- You never called us.</i>

01:23:12.888 --> 01:23:16.091
<i>- What happened?</i>
- I told you not to call me here.

01:23:16.267 --> 01:23:18.555
<i>We're dying! What happened?</i>

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:21.349
You want to know what happened?
Buy the book.

01:23:29.572 --> 01:23:32.359
I'm sorry about getting you mixed up
with that guy.

01:23:32.533 --> 01:23:34.133
It's OK.

01:23:34.577 --> 01:23:37.531
It wasn't too terrible. Weird?

01:23:40.665 --> 01:23:42.704
I'm really sorry about last night.

01:23:42.875 --> 01:23:46.873
The party. Lots of things.

01:23:51.009 --> 01:23:53.926
You know,
neither one of us is gonna die...

01:23:55.388 --> 01:23:57.131
...if it doesn't happen for us.

01:23:58.141 --> 01:24:02.055
- That's true.
- I just don't know right now.

01:24:02.228 --> 01:24:04.766
But I'm covered, OK. I won't get hurt.

01:24:06.733 --> 01:24:07.733
Sure.

01:24:10.694 --> 01:24:12.485
I'll leave it up to you.

01:24:14.156 --> 01:24:15.156
Fine.

01:24:44.644 --> 01:24:45.644
Oh!

01:25:01.869 --> 01:25:03.410
Her veil.

01:25:35.317 --> 01:25:37.476
Honey. Come on.

01:25:46.787 --> 01:25:48.530
- See you later.
- Bye.

01:25:48.706 --> 01:25:50.116
So long, kids.

01:26:05.346 --> 01:26:09.344
Oh, hi. My sister forgot her veil.

01:26:09.517 --> 01:26:12.269
I know she wouldn't want anything
to happen to it.

01:26:12.437 --> 01:26:15.521
- She's a little out of it.
- Just a little bit.

01:26:15.690 --> 01:26:18.561
Yeah, well excuse me.

01:26:18.735 --> 01:26:22.020
I want to make sure
I see my sister leave.

01:26:22.196 --> 01:26:24.770
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

01:26:25.992 --> 01:26:28.067
I need a drink.

01:27:02.068 --> 01:27:03.977
Yeah, you.

01:27:17.458 --> 01:27:18.869
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:27:19.043 --> 01:27:20.043
Hi.

01:27:23.838 --> 01:27:26.709
- What are you doing here?
- I heard you were here.

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:29.801
You came here for me?

01:27:30.845 --> 01:27:34.594
- Is that OK?
- Yeah, it's OK.

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:39.765
- Do you have to go to the reception?
- I'm supposed to.

01:27:41.314 --> 01:27:43.722
- Can I call you later?
- Sure.

01:27:46.236 --> 01:27:48.193
I mean, no.

01:27:51.031 --> 01:27:53.569
- No, I can't call you later?
- Yeah.

01:27:55.035 --> 01:27:57.740
No, I mean,
I'm not going to the reception.

01:27:59.957 --> 01:28:01.237
Oh, great.

01:28:46.752 --> 01:28:51.081
- Thanks for getting my undies back.
- Thanks for coming over.

01:28:52.507 --> 01:28:54.299
Thanks for coming to get me.

01:28:56.637 --> 01:28:58.428
Happy Birthday, Samantha.

01:29:00.724 --> 01:29:02.135
Make a wish.

01:29:05.103 --> 01:29:07.096
It already came true.

01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.173
~ <i>If you were here</i> ~

01:29:12.342 --> 01:29:15.462
