WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:01.710
David Walker had a lot of secrets.

00:01.760 --> 00:03.670
We've just found another -- Ellen Price.

00:03.719 --> 00:05.190
If they got friendly with him,

00:05.240 --> 00:06.990
they'd get invited to the gatherings.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.230
She was 12 years old. David
Walker sexually assaulted her.

00:10.280 --> 00:12.790
If this is true, I promise
you, I knew nothing about it.

00:12.840 --> 00:15.880
You clearly had no idea what sort
of a person your husband was.

00:15.960 --> 00:18.870
We need to consider the possibility
that one of these people

00:18.920 --> 00:21.230
were assaulted by Walker.
The question is, which?

00:21.280 --> 00:23.030
What the hell have you done?

00:23.080 --> 00:25.950
Don't blame me! She was the one
who done it in the first place.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.070
- What do you want?
- What we want is 20 grand

00:28.120 --> 00:29.390
or we tell social services

00:29.440 --> 00:32.509
about your husband being interviewed
in connection with a murder.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.670
The city in the '80s, was it
really as brutal as everyone says?

00:35.720 --> 00:38.760
- It screwed me up so much, I could
have killed someone. - Did it?

00:38.840 --> 00:42.760
An allegation was made by a Maria
Gonzalez. She said he raped her.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.310
The police have found people
that I hung about with...

00:45.360 --> 00:47.270
- in the '80s.
- What people?

00:47.320 --> 00:48.390
IRA.

00:48.440 --> 00:52.760
- Did you ever see her
with this man? - No...

00:52.840 --> 00:55.180
but she wanted us to kill him.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.240
I did always keep stuff.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.860
Silly bits of receipts and things.

01:58.960 --> 02:02.460
There'll be something that
proves I was there, abroad.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.320
All right, well...

02:05.400 --> 02:07.400
I'll start this side.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.270
- Bye, Daddy. I love you.
- Bye, sweetheart, I love you.

02:15.320 --> 02:18.260
- And remember, don't be late.
- I won't.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.310
- You didn't call me back.
- Someone stole my phone.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.430
When's our money coming?

02:37.360 --> 02:39.960
I can have it for you by Wednesday.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.670
I just want to be sure you're
making the right choices.

02:43.720 --> 02:46.470
- I'm making the right choices?
- Because like I said last week,

02:46.520 --> 02:50.000
I'm not the kind of man who forgets
when someone screws him over.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.070
That's very Liam Neeson.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.860
3:00, Wednesday, in the cafe. Be there.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.800
OK, thank you.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.520
She was in a B&B in Havering,

03:12.600 --> 03:16.080
the landlady found her when she
didn't come down for breakfast.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.110
- Found her?
- Unconscious.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.110
They're taking her in to St Agatha's now.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.960
- Is she gonna be OK?
- I have no idea.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.390
Love, I'm sorry.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.630
You see, you asked me to
take the wall down, Tony,

03:26.680 --> 03:28.030
but that's what's behind it --

03:28.080 --> 03:31.560
what I did to her and what I do to every
single relationship I've ever had --

03:31.640 --> 03:33.440
try to fuck it up.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.630
You're over-reacting.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.720
Cos I'm pissed off you stayed
married to a child-abuser?

03:41.800 --> 03:43.310
Sorry, but I wanna go home now.

03:43.360 --> 03:46.560
Oh, what, to that depressing little
flat and your pretend friends?

03:47.760 --> 03:49.960
Oh, God, Jason, I'm sorry.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.600
Come on.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.160
What is this? We've always
been there for each other.

03:56.240 --> 03:59.400
And I always thought that
was cos I needed you.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.470
Please, love, don't...

04:01.520 --> 04:04.200
Jason. Jason, please.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.320
Please, love.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.230
Please, don't leave me on my own.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.550
I think being on your own
is just what you need.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.070
Time to think about who you are.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.430
So, first we need to identify the house,

04:20.480 --> 04:22.590
and if we can do that,
then we'll try and find

04:22.640 --> 04:24.230
the owner at the relevant time.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.030
- Which was when?
- Erm...

04:26.080 --> 04:30.040
Our witness says the gatherings
took place between 1981 and 1983.

04:30.120 --> 04:33.190
- And this is... Ellen Price...
- Hm.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.790
.. who was at a reform school
when she says this happened?

04:35.840 --> 04:40.160
And is a very successful
marketing executive now.

04:41.440 --> 04:44.150
And do we have any reason to
believe any of your suspects

04:44.200 --> 04:46.550
could have ever found
themselves at this address?

04:46.600 --> 04:49.880
Well, that's our primary focus now.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.550
Were they in London at
that time? Were they...

04:54.600 --> 04:58.240
- vulnerable, in care? All
of that sort of stuff. - OK.

04:58.320 --> 05:01.320
With Marion Kelsey being our priority

05:01.400 --> 05:03.710
after Sinead Quinn's statement yesterday.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.150
And clearly, if what Ms
Price is saying is true,

05:06.200 --> 05:08.750
then we're looking at a
whole separate investigation.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.230
Possible multiple sexual
assaults on children.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.880
- Multiple suspects.
- Maybe, yes.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.710
Well, I know you'll be aware

05:17.760 --> 05:19.790
of how carefully we
need to tread here, Cass.

05:19.840 --> 05:22.630
Notwithstanding the mistakes
that we have made in the past,

05:22.680 --> 05:25.880
there are also some very
unreliable witnesses out there.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.750
Very aware of that, sir,

05:27.800 --> 05:30.540
and we'll tread very carefully indeed.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.910
So, cos a few unfortunate
people made some stuff up,

05:34.960 --> 05:36.590
suddenly it's all made up, again,

05:36.640 --> 05:38.430
like it has been for the last 50 years.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.150
Yeah, I know. It's rubbish, isn't it?

05:41.560 --> 05:42.960
Listen...

05:44.040 --> 05:46.870
.. I'm sorry if I got arsey the other day.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.260
I'm sorry if I got arsey, too.

05:49.760 --> 05:53.640
I think... with my girls,

05:53.720 --> 05:55.910
I just get very emotional about it all.

05:55.960 --> 05:58.400
No, yeah, I get it.

05:58.480 --> 05:59.620
Hm.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.070
So, where are we with Maudsley?

06:03.120 --> 06:06.200
We still need to know if Colin
Osborne could have ever got out.

06:06.280 --> 06:09.400
Yeah, yeah, no, I'll chase
up, and the airline manifests.

06:09.480 --> 06:14.160
Oh, OK. And then I want
Marion, Sara and Colin in,

06:14.240 --> 06:15.590
all three of 'em together.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.150
- What are we saying, a
voluntary interview? - Hm.

06:18.200 --> 06:21.110
And we're gonna need photos of
them when they were teenagers,

06:21.160 --> 06:22.790
I wanna show them to Ellen Price.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.110
Oh, we can't use photo ID from Price.

06:25.160 --> 06:28.200
I'm not worried about evidence,
I wanna know I'm not going mad.

06:28.280 --> 06:31.030
You don't wanna concentrate
on just Marion Kelsey for now?

06:31.080 --> 06:32.150
No, I don't think so.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.230
Maybe they were all at
one of these parties.

06:34.280 --> 06:36.550
- They all knew each
other, you mean? - Why not?

06:36.600 --> 06:38.830
And maybe all three were
involved in his murder,

06:38.880 --> 06:40.070
so I want it coordinated.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.280
I want them all in the front
office at the same time.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.880
So, Maria Gonzalez.

06:52.960 --> 06:57.400
We placed her with Klein
Egerton on 13th March, 1990.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.910
13th, that's interesting.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.120
- And she left on the 17th
it says there. - Right.

07:02.200 --> 07:05.360
And was this her home
address at that time here?

07:05.440 --> 07:07.030
- Yeah.
- It's been really helpful.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.910
Would you mind if I took a copy of this?

07:08.960 --> 07:11.510
You can have it, love. She
hasn't been back in 26 years,

07:11.560 --> 07:15.060
so I don't think we'll be
getting any return business.

07:15.800 --> 07:16.950
Sorry, what's this here?

07:17.000 --> 07:20.200
That's just her reference,
her previous employer.

07:31.240 --> 07:33.070
- David Walker?
- Yeah.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.360
I went online at Companies House
and looked at his accounts,

07:36.440 --> 07:39.110
Gonzalez worked for Walker for 18 months

07:39.160 --> 07:41.350
before she temped at Klein Egerton's.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.680
- As what?
- A dancer.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.550
And she'd only been at Klein's two days

07:46.600 --> 07:49.200
before she made the rape allegation.

07:49.400 --> 07:52.680
OK, so we have photos of
Osbourne with Walker in February,

07:52.760 --> 07:54.030
and then a few weeks later,

07:54.080 --> 07:57.840
a woman who clearly knows Walker
very well gets a temp job at Klein's.

07:57.920 --> 08:01.910
And within two days, she accuses
Colin Osbourne, a gay man,

08:01.960 --> 08:03.230
of raping her.

08:03.280 --> 08:06.600
So, even in 1990, a woman makes
a very public accusation of rape,

08:06.680 --> 08:09.110
you'd reasonably assume the
police would be called.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.950
- Yeah.
- The man would be interviewed,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.590
at the very least, his
reputation is seriously damaged,

08:13.640 --> 08:15.310
at the very worst, he goes to trial.

08:15.360 --> 08:19.320
- Except this is banking and they...
- It's all handled internally. - Yeah.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.880
But if you took that anomaly out of
the equation, you'd have to assume

08:22.960 --> 08:26.080
that someone wanted Colin Osbourne
out the picture, wouldn't you?

08:26.160 --> 08:28.700
And that someone was David Walker.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.700
Hi. Mr Osbourne?

08:40.780 --> 08:43.780
DC Fran Lingley. Can I have a quick word?

08:48.300 --> 08:51.010
Hello, young man. DS Murray Boulting.

08:51.060 --> 08:53.400
Is your mum or dad in, please?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.780
Hello, there. DC Jake Collier.

08:58.860 --> 09:01.860
Have you got five minutes
please, Mrs Kelsey?

09:03.940 --> 09:05.780
This is it.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.900
It's here.

09:16.020 --> 09:18.420
Yeah, it's that one over there.

09:19.580 --> 09:21.520
- How sure?
- 100%.

09:23.260 --> 09:25.000
It's the number.

09:25.860 --> 09:28.860
There was a joke going
around around that time.

09:29.980 --> 09:34.180
99 is like a 69, except you
shove a flake up your...

09:36.860 --> 09:40.060
He told me that gag the
first time we were there.

09:40.700 --> 09:44.260
Yeah. There.

09:44.340 --> 09:46.570
So, how many times did you come here?

09:46.620 --> 09:48.410
- Three.
- Always with Walker?

09:48.460 --> 09:50.610
He was always the one
that picked me up, yeah.

09:50.660 --> 09:52.930
- From your school.
- Yeah.

09:55.300 --> 09:57.810
So, what did your
headmaster say about that?

09:57.860 --> 10:01.160
The gatherings were supposed
to be prayer evenings.

10:01.940 --> 10:04.090
There was a bloke there
that was something to do

10:04.140 --> 10:05.890
with the local church.

10:05.940 --> 10:08.570
We were supposed to be reading the Bible,

10:08.620 --> 10:10.700
talking about God.

10:12.700 --> 10:13.900
No...

10:15.300 --> 10:17.640
.. it was never a problem, no.

10:19.460 --> 10:22.500
And Walker would... would
pick you up in his car?

10:22.580 --> 10:25.320
In a taxi, he came straight from work.

10:26.620 --> 10:28.850
And how would you get back from the party?

10:28.900 --> 10:30.240
Sorry...

10:32.820 --> 10:35.160
.. this is weird, I've erm...

10:37.100 --> 10:40.540
.. I've never talked
about this in 35 years.

10:40.620 --> 10:43.420
Not to my husband, not to anyone.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.900
- If you want to stop...
- No.

10:46.580 --> 10:49.250
It's fine. It's all right, it's fine.

10:50.260 --> 10:51.600
Twice...

10:53.220 --> 10:56.420
.. he put me in a taxi to take me back.

10:56.500 --> 11:01.900
- Right. - And another time,
there was a woman that...

11:01.980 --> 11:03.740
drove us back.

11:03.820 --> 11:07.500
- Was that a woman from the party?
- No, she just turned up outside.

11:08.940 --> 11:11.210
She had a row with Walker
on the pavement there,

11:11.260 --> 11:12.490
she was screaming at him,

11:12.540 --> 11:16.180
- I think she was his wife or
girlfriend or something. - OK.

11:18.980 --> 11:22.420
And how many other children were here?

11:23.500 --> 11:26.620
There were never less than half a dozen.

11:26.700 --> 11:29.860
- Age range?
- The youngest was about 12.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.810
The oldest maybe...

11:33.740 --> 11:35.010
.. 16.

11:36.060 --> 11:38.060
And how many adults?

11:39.100 --> 11:41.100
About the same.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.570
There was something for everyone.

11:48.980 --> 11:51.810
If I showed you some photographs
of some other children

11:51.860 --> 11:53.610
we think might have been here as well,

11:53.660 --> 11:56.740
- do you think you might be able
to recognise any of them? - Er...

11:57.900 --> 12:00.580
I suppose it's worth a try, yeah.

12:02.660 --> 12:03.800
Hm.

12:05.100 --> 12:08.420
I'm so sorry. I'll just...
I'll be two minutes.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.060
Are you OK?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.500
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:26.260 --> 12:27.970
- Sunny.
- So the Maudsley say

12:28.020 --> 12:30.850
they had a soft locked-door
policy in the 1990s,

12:30.900 --> 12:32.930
meaning that it was
hard but not impossible

12:32.980 --> 12:34.370
for a patient to walk out.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.410
But can they confirm Osborne was there?

12:36.460 --> 12:38.850
Yeah, yeah, for the
exact dates he stipulated

12:38.900 --> 12:41.370
and there's no record of
him absconding at any time.

12:41.420 --> 12:42.650
But they can't rule it out?

12:42.700 --> 12:46.220
- If he was in and out within
a few hours, then, no. - OK.

12:46.300 --> 12:47.570
And then Sara Alazi,

12:47.620 --> 12:50.780
we have found both her
outbound flight in March

12:50.860 --> 12:52.570
and her inbound flight in December.

12:52.620 --> 12:55.610
But what we can't do
is check every airline,

12:55.660 --> 12:57.410
rail service, ferry service

12:57.460 --> 13:00.090
for every day between her
departure and the 8th of May

13:00.140 --> 13:02.690
to see if she returned here at any point.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.620
No, OK, thanks. Listen, right now

13:05.700 --> 13:08.330
I need you to pull Tessa Nixon in again.

13:08.380 --> 13:11.860
My witness here might be able to
place her at this house in Brentford.

13:11.940 --> 13:14.940
- Wow.
- Yeah, I know. Thanks.

13:16.300 --> 13:17.440
Hm.

13:27.860 --> 13:29.660
Hello. Can I help?

13:29.740 --> 13:33.340
- Hi, there. DCI Cassie Stuart,
Bishop Street Station. - OK.

13:33.420 --> 13:35.650
You don't happen to know
who lives here, do you?

13:35.700 --> 13:39.620
- Oh, yeah, that's Pete and Katie.
- Right, looks like they've got kids?

13:39.700 --> 13:43.500
One, Rosie, she's three
now, and then one on the way.

13:43.580 --> 13:46.250
- Have they been here long?
- Oh, about five or six years?

13:46.300 --> 13:49.290
You don't happen to know who
lived here before them, do you?

13:49.340 --> 13:52.130
Before them was Ken, he
was here donkey's years.

13:52.180 --> 13:55.130
- Do you remember his surname?
- Er... no.

13:55.180 --> 13:56.970
But he worked for the council, I think,

13:57.020 --> 13:59.010
some sort of social service or something.

13:59.060 --> 14:03.420
And when you say "donkey's years",
roughly how long did he live here?

14:03.500 --> 14:06.580
Well before me and I've
been here since '79.

14:07.500 --> 14:08.770
Right.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.440
- Brilliant. - OK.
- Thanks for your help.

14:12.820 --> 14:15.700
Oh. Sorry, just one more thing.

14:15.780 --> 14:18.170
You don't have any idea
where he moved to, do you?

14:18.220 --> 14:21.460
Oh, yeah. About half a
mile down that road...

14:21.540 --> 14:24.010
to the cemetery. He's dead, love.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.100
Thank you.

14:32.060 --> 14:33.450
She is out of line doing this.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.410
You could have rung me, I'd have come up.

14:35.460 --> 14:38.780
Come on, let's not make this any
harder than it needs to be, Tess.

14:38.860 --> 14:41.060
Detective Inspector Nixon.

14:54.900 --> 14:57.610
Sorry, Marion, can you bear
with us for two minutes?

14:57.660 --> 14:59.930
- Bit short on interview rooms.
- Yeah, sure.

14:59.980 --> 15:03.420
Do you wanna take a seat?
Grab you a tea or a coffee?

15:03.500 --> 15:07.300
- Yeah, I'll have a tea. Milk,
no sugar, please. - No worries.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.050
As I said, Colin, you're
obviously not being arrested,

15:18.100 --> 15:20.090
but you will be questioned under caution,

15:20.140 --> 15:22.410
so would you like a solicitor present?

15:22.460 --> 15:24.210
No, I'll be fine, thank you.

15:24.260 --> 15:27.130
OK. Just grab a seat, I'll be right back.

15:41.180 --> 15:43.380
Do you recognise this girl?

15:47.900 --> 15:49.900
No, sorry.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.300
No problem.

15:59.060 --> 16:01.060
What about this one?

16:08.140 --> 16:10.140
Show me the next one.

16:21.820 --> 16:24.160
Show me the middle one again.

16:33.140 --> 16:36.500
It was 35 years ago and I was drunk...

16:39.940 --> 16:42.220
.. but this girl...

16:42.300 --> 16:45.100
I'm pretty certain she was at the party.

16:45.860 --> 16:48.460
I'm pretty certain I recognise her.

16:57.740 --> 17:00.570
- Have any of them spoken
to each other? - No.

17:00.620 --> 17:04.020
- Looked at each other?
- Nothing. - Which is weird.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.890
Weird?

17:06.940 --> 17:11.460
Well, you nod at people in a
situation like this, don't you?

17:11.540 --> 17:14.020
You talk about the weather...

17:14.099 --> 17:15.770
shit coffee...

17:16.980 --> 17:18.980
Don't you?

17:20.660 --> 17:22.000
I guess.

17:22.780 --> 17:25.140
OK, you do Tessa.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.420
I'll do Marion.

17:29.380 --> 17:30.690
I gave evidence against her.

17:30.740 --> 17:33.050
- Why would she not try
and drop me in it? - Hm.

17:33.100 --> 17:36.860
So you think that's why Sinead Quinn
said this stuff about you and Walker?

17:36.940 --> 17:38.860
Absolutely.

17:38.940 --> 17:42.180
And so how do you think
she knew who he was?

17:43.700 --> 17:46.530
Well, maybe it was her who
identified him as a possible target?

17:46.580 --> 17:49.450
- Her who wrote that address down?
- Of your parents' house?

17:49.500 --> 17:51.170
She was my girlfriend at the time,

17:51.220 --> 17:54.260
we stayed there on several occasions
when my parents were away.

17:54.340 --> 17:57.250
But whichever of you it was
gave him your parents' address

17:57.300 --> 18:00.500
on the 7th of May, that's the
day before he disappeared...

18:00.580 --> 18:03.980
it suggests you were staying
there, in North London.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.090
Yeah, I guess so.

18:07.140 --> 18:10.580
Just a few miles from where David
Walker's body was eventually found.

18:12.020 --> 18:15.660
OK, I want, if I may, Marion...

18:16.740 --> 18:19.900
.. to ask you a couple of
questions about your childhood?

18:19.980 --> 18:22.780
So, you were brought up by your parents?

18:23.700 --> 18:25.500
- Yes.
- Hm.

18:25.580 --> 18:27.810
- And you lived with
them till what age? - 16.

18:27.860 --> 18:29.810
Did you have any problems with the police?

18:29.860 --> 18:32.090
Other than the one
you've asked me about, no.

18:32.140 --> 18:35.380
- You never spent any time in any
youth-detention facilities? - No.

18:37.900 --> 18:40.170
- No periods in care.
- No.

18:41.940 --> 18:44.610
- You ever run away from home?
- No.

18:45.980 --> 18:49.770
- And your mother would corroborate
this, would she? - Yes.

18:49.820 --> 18:53.340
Does the address 99 Shanklin Avenue

18:53.420 --> 18:56.360
- in Brentford mean
anything to you? - No.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.700
This is it.

19:02.820 --> 19:04.490
I've never seen it before.

19:04.540 --> 19:06.570
You've never been to any parties there?

19:06.620 --> 19:09.380
A party? Jesus. I don't know, when?

19:09.460 --> 19:13.300
At some point between 1981 and 1983.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.450
- OK, well I think that's fairly unlikely.
- And why's that?

19:16.500 --> 19:18.410
Well, firstly I was only 14 in 1983

19:18.460 --> 19:21.410
and my parents were not that
relaxed about that sort of thing.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.570
But more to the point, I don't think

19:23.620 --> 19:26.660
they would have been that happy
about driving me to Brentford,

19:26.740 --> 19:30.180
given that between 1980 and
1985, we lived in Ireland.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.010
If he was doing this sort of stuff,

19:34.060 --> 19:36.850
how on Earth would I
have known about it? Hm?

19:36.900 --> 19:38.930
He would have done
everything he could have

19:38.980 --> 19:41.320
to keep it from me, obviously.

19:42.020 --> 19:44.530
Except wives often do
suspect, Tessa, you know that,

19:44.580 --> 19:45.970
you're a copper.

19:46.020 --> 19:47.620
Little girls!

19:48.100 --> 19:50.220
They have an instinct...

19:50.300 --> 19:53.700
which they can ignore
sometimes for years because...

19:54.580 --> 19:57.320
.. who would want to ever dig that up.

19:57.900 --> 20:01.100
But then one day, I guess
it just gets too much.

20:02.380 --> 20:07.420
And maybe you follow him... from work...

20:08.500 --> 20:09.810
.. on one of those nights

20:09.860 --> 20:12.530
when he always said that
he had late meetings.

20:12.580 --> 20:15.250
One of those nights when he
came home smelling of booze

20:15.300 --> 20:18.500
and something else,
something that scared you.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.690
And you saw where he went...

20:23.260 --> 20:25.200
.. and then later...

20:25.860 --> 20:28.580
.. a child coming out with him.

20:33.260 --> 20:35.060
No.

20:35.140 --> 20:37.680
And you were disgusted, of course.

20:37.740 --> 20:39.980
And you fought with him,

20:40.060 --> 20:43.560
and you took that child
back to her residential home.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.460
It's a nice theory...

20:49.180 --> 20:51.490
.. but that is all it is, DS Khan.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.740
You know that, I know that.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.700
Except we have a witness...

21:02.100 --> 21:06.620
.. who says she remembers
being driven home by a woman

21:06.700 --> 21:10.060
in a blue convertible Golf with red trim.

21:13.820 --> 21:15.890
What car did you drive?

21:27.280 --> 21:29.160
Hello.

21:29.240 --> 21:32.320
- I'm looking for Maria Gonzalez. - Mum.

21:32.400 --> 21:35.480
I'd imagine that was a very
traumatic event for you.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.310
Yes.

21:39.360 --> 21:42.720
Doubly so in that Mr Osbourne
was never charged with anything.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.360
No.

21:46.440 --> 21:49.800
If you don't mind me asking,
why didn't you call the police?

21:52.200 --> 21:55.800
I didn't want to go through
the trauma of a rape trial.

21:56.320 --> 21:57.790
Absolutely.

21:58.520 --> 22:01.520
They are a very difficult
thing to go through.

22:03.280 --> 22:07.720
Mrs Gonzalez, there's a couple of
things I'm still confused about.

22:07.800 --> 22:10.740
Firstly, did you know Mr Osbourne was gay?

22:14.280 --> 22:15.420
OK.

22:17.200 --> 22:20.500
Secondly, what can you
tell me about David Walker?

23:00.080 --> 23:01.710
Basically, she's now admitting

23:01.760 --> 23:04.590
that Walker paid her five
grand to make it all up.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.680
- Bloody hell. - Apparently,
Osbourne was a very heavy drinker,

23:07.760 --> 23:09.840
which Walker knew.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.470
So, Gonzalez plied him
with booze at this party,

23:12.520 --> 23:14.790
and took him to the toilets
where he passed out.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.630
20 minutes later, she was
found down a stairwell,

23:17.680 --> 23:19.870
"distressed and partially undressed".

23:19.920 --> 23:22.830
- Was she meant to go to the police?
- Absolutely.

23:22.880 --> 23:25.880
Her conscience wouldn't let
her go through with it.

23:25.960 --> 23:29.400
Yeah, that and the ten grand Klein
Egerton offered her to keep shtoom.

23:29.480 --> 23:33.200
And did she know why
Walker asked her to do this?

23:33.280 --> 23:36.920
She said all she knew was
that Walker had said,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.270
"Osbourne was a nosey little fucker

23:39.320 --> 23:42.060
who'd asked him one question too many".

23:53.640 --> 23:56.320
- Hi, there.
- Jesus, Grandad.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.870
Sorry, mate.

24:00.920 --> 24:02.510
He's lost his wallet, I'm afraid,

24:02.560 --> 24:05.190
and he wanted to walk home
but Egham's a bit of schlep,

24:05.240 --> 24:07.230
- so we gave him a lift into town.
- Right.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.590
He just needs a bit of a kip.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.310
Is he OK? He's not in any trouble...

24:10.360 --> 24:13.720
No, no, he's fine, but he did seem
a bit tearful on the way in but...

24:13.800 --> 24:15.760
Right, yeah.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.430
He lost his wife a couple of years ago...

24:18.480 --> 24:20.230
and he's been finding it hard.

24:20.280 --> 24:23.560
Sorry to hear that. I'll
leave you to it then.

24:23.640 --> 24:25.720
Yes, thanks again.

24:30.360 --> 24:32.590
OK, I'm gonna start, if I may, Colin,

24:32.640 --> 24:35.720
- by going back to your
departure from Klein's? - Yes.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.800
Can you tell me why you didn't
mention the rape allegation

24:38.880 --> 24:42.080
that was made against you
the last time we spoke?

24:44.720 --> 24:46.920
Well, for obvious reasons.

24:48.520 --> 24:51.260
It's something that you're ashamed of?

24:52.440 --> 24:55.040
It's the worst thing I've ever done.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.880
It's sat with me every day for...

25:02.400 --> 25:03.750
.. almost 30 years.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.880
Er..... even talking about it now...

25:08.760 --> 25:10.760
.. it disgusts me.

25:12.320 --> 25:15.880
And what is your
recollection of the event?

25:15.960 --> 25:19.280
I had... I have no
recollection of the event,

25:19.360 --> 25:22.860
- of any of the evening.
- Because you were too drunk?

25:25.840 --> 25:30.840
I was going through a period of
having blackouts, losing whole days.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.390
- You were drinking that heavily?
- Sadly, yes.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.840
- Did you know you were gay at
the time of the allegation? - No.

25:38.920 --> 25:41.870
Well, maybe instinctively,
but I certainly hadn't

25:41.920 --> 25:44.520
admitted it to myself.

25:44.600 --> 25:49.880
I'm guessing that it's going
to... er... shock you...

25:49.960 --> 25:53.040
to learn that we have evidence to suggest

25:53.120 --> 25:56.840
that Maria Gonzalez
made up the allegation.

25:58.880 --> 26:01.350
That she was paid to make it up.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.520
Paid by who?

26:25.160 --> 26:28.640
- By David Walker.
- Oh, but why? Why?

26:30.240 --> 26:33.540
Well, that's what we were
hoping you could tell us.

26:38.040 --> 26:40.960
- I have no idea.
- Really?

26:43.480 --> 26:45.480
Well... well, erm...

26:46.960 --> 26:50.400
.. like I said, I... I...

26:52.240 --> 26:57.880
I... don't even remember meeting him.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.300
Colin...

27:00.920 --> 27:02.950
.. we find that hard to believe.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.960
We've got photos of you with
him, your number's in his diary.

27:07.040 --> 27:11.400
According to Maria Gonzalez, you
were asking him lots of questions

27:11.480 --> 27:14.350
in the weeks before she did what she did.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.790
So, what were you asking him?

27:17.840 --> 27:19.870
I have no idea what you're talking about.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.710
- Were you asking him
questions about his past? - No.

27:22.760 --> 27:25.590
Were you trying to discover if
this was the same David Walker

27:25.640 --> 27:29.960
that attended parties in the early
1980s at a house in Brentford.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.230
Parties? What parties?

27:31.280 --> 27:35.180
Parties that we think that you
also attended as a teenager.

27:38.200 --> 27:41.520
- No. - Where we think Walker
might have sexually assaulted you.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.830
I was born and raised in Scotland.

27:46.880 --> 27:50.510
The first time I came to London was
when I went to university in 1985.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.560
I...

27:52.720 --> 27:54.720
I was 19.

27:58.040 --> 28:01.910
- Are your parents still alive, Colin?
- Yeah. Well, my dad, yeah.

28:02.760 --> 28:05.560
And he would corroborate that, would he?

28:06.560 --> 28:08.310
Of course he would corroborate it.

28:08.360 --> 28:12.440
Did you know a Marion Kelsey?
Maiden name -- Marion Dunphy.

28:14.280 --> 28:16.230
- No.
- Or Sara Alazi.

28:16.280 --> 28:20.640
Again, that would have been her
maiden name, she's now... Mahmoud.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.150
No. I want to leave now.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.430
Where have you been?

28:40.480 --> 28:42.510
I've been interviewed by the police again.

28:42.560 --> 28:43.950
Is everything OK?

28:44.000 --> 28:46.270
Yeah, fine. Did you need me?

28:46.320 --> 28:49.320
Flo had ballet, you were
meant to pick her up.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.590
God, I'm sorry.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.790
No, it's fine, Freya's
mum brought her home,

28:55.840 --> 28:58.780
but listen, I think we need to talk, love.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.190
- Mr Mahmoud?
- Yes.

29:11.240 --> 29:14.680
I'm so sorry to disturb you, I
got your address from the mosque.

29:14.760 --> 29:18.280
I was wondering if I could talk to
you for a few moments about Sara?

29:18.360 --> 29:22.160
- I'm sorry, I don't wanna talk about...
- Please, please.

29:22.520 --> 29:25.190
I found these images
on my grandson's phone

29:25.240 --> 29:27.640
with jokes about Mrs Mahmoud,

29:27.720 --> 29:30.520
and I believe that woman is my daughter.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.680
- So where were you
brought up, Sara? - Hayes.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.960
- With Mum and Dad?
- Yes.

29:38.760 --> 29:41.160
And are your parents alive now?

29:41.240 --> 29:43.830
No, they both died in a
car crash when I was 20.

29:43.880 --> 29:49.040
Sara's mother died in a car
accident on Christmas Eve 1980

29:49.120 --> 29:50.830
when Sara was just 12.

29:50.880 --> 29:55.000
I'm very sorry to hear that.
But you had a happy childhood?

29:55.080 --> 29:56.230
Yes, it was very happy.

29:56.280 --> 29:59.520
Sara was completely devastated
by the loss of her mother,

29:59.600 --> 30:01.540
they were very close.

30:02.120 --> 30:04.320
Perfectly understandably...

30:04.920 --> 30:06.910
.. her death made her very angry.

30:06.960 --> 30:09.160
With the world, I guess...

30:10.160 --> 30:12.230
.. and me, particularly.

30:12.280 --> 30:14.510
- You enjoyed school?
- Yes.

30:14.560 --> 30:17.070
She started to play truant at school,

30:17.120 --> 30:19.320
to fight with her friends.

30:19.880 --> 30:24.080
And was incredibly challenging at home,

30:24.160 --> 30:26.230
refusing to abide by any rules.

30:26.280 --> 30:29.320
- You never got in to any
kind of trouble? - No.

30:29.400 --> 30:34.000
She started to drink and smoke,
and I think even to take drugs.

30:34.080 --> 30:37.480
- No trouble outside of school?
- No.

30:37.560 --> 30:41.160
I lost count of the number of
times the police brought her home

30:41.240 --> 30:42.580
to me...

30:43.920 --> 30:45.670
.. in the middle of the night.

30:45.720 --> 30:49.040
- And when did you leave school?
- When I was 16.

30:49.120 --> 30:52.880
By 13, she pretty much stopped
going to school altogether...

30:54.360 --> 30:57.230
.. and very often she'd
stay out all night.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.520
I tried to be tough, I tried to be gentle.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.320
I tried everything...

31:06.360 --> 31:08.550
.. until I had no idea what to do.

31:08.600 --> 31:12.680
- Why so young? Why didn't you
do A levels? - Just didn't.

31:12.760 --> 31:14.520
And then, I...

31:20.120 --> 31:22.910
.. I did something I'll
regret till the day I die.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.030
You were clearly smart.

31:28.160 --> 31:31.400
You should have done sixth
form, gone on to university.

31:31.480 --> 31:34.200
- What happened?
- Nothing.

31:35.160 --> 31:39.520
And so I told her, if she couldn't
live in my house by my rules...

31:41.880 --> 31:43.880
.. she had to leave.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.720
When she was 13?

31:52.720 --> 31:56.400
Of course, I never expected her

31:56.480 --> 32:00.880
to actually do it, to leave, but she did.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.270
I don't believe you, Sara.

32:03.320 --> 32:05.520
I think something...

32:05.600 --> 32:08.960
very bad happened to you around this time.

32:09.040 --> 32:12.440
- No. - And I think it had something...

32:12.520 --> 32:14.520
to do with this house.

32:20.960 --> 32:22.960
Do you recognise it?

32:27.240 --> 32:29.240
No.

32:30.040 --> 32:32.190
This is 99 Shanklin Avenue.

32:32.240 --> 32:34.710
Of course, I reported it to the police,

32:34.760 --> 32:37.030
who were completely uninterested

32:37.080 --> 32:40.580
and who kept saying she'd
come back when she's ready.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.560
So, we looked for her.

32:47.600 --> 32:50.400
Her brother had heard she had a...

32:50.480 --> 32:52.800
room in a squat.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.400
Did David Walker do
something to you here, Sara?

32:57.960 --> 33:00.630
So, we looked there and then in hostels,

33:00.680 --> 33:02.680
and houses with men...

33:03.800 --> 33:09.280
.. who we heard... took
her places and used her.

33:11.600 --> 33:13.270
At a gathering?

33:14.280 --> 33:15.310
No.

33:15.360 --> 33:19.120
For months, for years,
we looked for her...

33:19.200 --> 33:20.270
but never found her.

33:20.320 --> 33:22.110
We want to help you, Sara.

33:22.160 --> 33:25.100
And then we just stopped hearing anything.

33:25.520 --> 33:29.600
You don't wanna help me, you
just wanna solve your case.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.080
I want a solicitor.

33:39.120 --> 33:41.000
Please...

33:41.080 --> 33:43.440
just tell her I love her.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.590
I've always loved her...

33:47.800 --> 33:52.000
.. and I'm so, so sorry for what I did.

34:28.280 --> 34:29.800
Zoe.

34:29.880 --> 34:33.310
Zoe. No, I just want to speak to Zoe.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.820
I didn't kill that man...

34:49.159 --> 34:52.440
.. and you must know I would
never hurt a hair on her head.

34:52.520 --> 34:55.440
I do, 100%, but...

34:58.800 --> 35:01.960
.. there's still stuff
that you're not telling me,

35:02.040 --> 35:03.510
stuff you've never told me.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.550
And I used to be OK with that,

35:05.600 --> 35:08.840
but when it starts impacting on her,

35:08.920 --> 35:13.480
when... when we start bringing
more chaos into her life,

35:13.560 --> 35:17.040
I can't do that to her, not after
everything that she's been through.

35:18.280 --> 35:24.080
And so... as deeply
painful as it would be...

35:24.160 --> 35:27.160
I would give her up, I
would give her back...

35:28.440 --> 35:30.470
.. if I thought for a
second that keeping her

35:30.520 --> 35:32.990
would jeopardise her well-being.

35:33.400 --> 35:35.870
If I could tell you the truth...

35:36.880 --> 35:40.600
.. Simon... I would, but I can't.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.340
So I'm gonna call Janet now...

35:46.160 --> 35:48.960
.. and tell her what's been happening...

35:49.920 --> 35:53.620
.. and ask for her help in
deciding what's best for Flo.

36:16.820 --> 36:21.060
- Erm... duty solicitor's
on his way for Sara. - OK.

36:23.900 --> 36:27.180
You definitely think she was
there, at one of these gatherings?

36:27.260 --> 36:29.170
Ellen Price thinks she recognised her.

36:29.220 --> 36:32.460
If you'd seen her face when I showed
her the photo of Shanklin Avenue...

36:36.740 --> 36:38.410
Cassie Stuart.

36:45.980 --> 36:50.820
Sara's husband's downstairs, he
says he has something I need to see.

36:56.100 --> 36:58.100
Mr Mahmoud?

36:58.460 --> 37:02.300
She told me that your victim
died on 8th May, 1990.

37:03.140 --> 37:05.140
Yes.

37:05.500 --> 37:08.700
A ticket stub to see Roma play Lazio

37:08.780 --> 37:12.900
and a photo of her in a cafe in Rome...

37:13.820 --> 37:17.020
.. date stamped on the 8th.

37:17.100 --> 37:21.500
On the 9th, a train ticket to
Naples and a photo of her...

37:22.820 --> 37:27.500
inside a bar in Naples,
date stamped on the 9th.

37:27.580 --> 37:31.220
On the 10th, restaurant receipts
in Naples, and on the 11th,

37:31.300 --> 37:35.060
a new inter-railing card, stamped
and dated with her photo in Naples.

37:40.100 --> 37:42.370
I'm taking my wife home now.

38:03.820 --> 38:05.760
I love you very much.

38:06.660 --> 38:08.600
.. and I always will.

38:09.660 --> 38:12.010
I've sent the boys to my brother's,

38:12.060 --> 38:14.660
there's some stuff you need to know.

38:14.940 --> 38:17.010
We had a visitor today.

38:29.300 --> 38:31.940
OK, I now officially give up.

38:37.660 --> 38:39.210
And a glass of Malbec.

38:39.260 --> 38:40.770
No, no, no, I'm here, I'm here.

38:40.820 --> 38:43.490
- Has he come out of his room?
- No.

38:44.340 --> 38:46.690
The bloke didn't clobber
him or anything, did he?

38:46.740 --> 38:48.970
No, but I can't imagine it went well.

38:49.020 --> 38:50.810
Unless he got pissed before the event,

38:50.860 --> 38:52.330
which is always a possibility.

38:52.380 --> 38:56.100
Yeah, OK. Erm... look,
I'm gonna be a while.

38:56.180 --> 38:58.570
I'll be back about 10:30, 11:00.

38:58.620 --> 39:01.090
Cool, I'll take him up some grub in a bit.

39:01.140 --> 39:02.980
OK. Love you.

39:05.300 --> 39:08.170
Erm... can I get a large vodka with that?

39:26.140 --> 39:29.500
I said I needed to be on my
own, pulled my cancer-kid face.

39:31.380 --> 39:32.650
Erm...

39:33.660 --> 39:35.660
It's er... It seems...

39:36.820 --> 39:39.540
.. unbelievably selfish erm...

39:39.620 --> 39:42.780
that I'm saying this to you
of all people, but erm...

39:42.860 --> 39:45.610
I just really want you
to understand two things.

39:45.660 --> 39:50.500
Firstly, erm... I have some
serious crap in my life

39:50.580 --> 39:53.130
which makes me... has always made me

39:53.180 --> 39:54.890
hurt the people I'm closest to.

39:54.940 --> 39:57.290
It makes me push them
away whenever I get scared

39:57.340 --> 40:00.420
that they might see something
that, yeah, I didn't want them to.

40:00.500 --> 40:02.260
And I'm...

40:03.580 --> 40:07.810
.. I'm so sorry that I did that
to you cos you didn't deserve it.

40:07.860 --> 40:11.260
And the second thing I
wanted to say was that erm...

40:13.500 --> 40:14.930
.. if I'd ever had a daughter,

40:14.980 --> 40:17.170
I would have wanted her
to be just like you

40:17.220 --> 40:19.820
because... I think you're smashing.

40:45.780 --> 40:48.410
It's like all the key pieces
of an investigation are there

40:48.460 --> 40:50.980
but nothing, nothing...

40:51.060 --> 40:52.250
quite fits.

40:52.300 --> 40:53.690
Sara...

40:53.740 --> 40:56.090
- had the motive but not
the opportunity. - Yeah.

40:56.140 --> 41:00.260
- Marion had the opportunity
but no obvious motive. - Hm.

41:00.340 --> 41:05.660
Colin is clearly somehow
connected to him, but just...

41:06.780 --> 41:09.610
.. join the suspects up, I'm sure that...

41:09.660 --> 41:13.360
Do you know what, can we just
talk about something else?

41:14.100 --> 41:17.100
Yeah. What do you wanna talk about?

41:21.700 --> 41:23.700
How was your date?

41:27.200 --> 41:29.600
- Tell me, how was it?
- No...

41:31.880 --> 41:33.020
Hi.

41:36.220 --> 41:38.420
I know what you did, Tony.

41:39.620 --> 41:43.060
- What did I do? - They're
yours, I know, I've always known.

41:43.140 --> 41:46.080
- What are mine?
- Ned and Jack. Come on.

41:47.580 --> 41:49.530
I'm the father of your sister's children?

41:49.580 --> 41:51.130
And a part of me doesn't blame you

41:51.180 --> 41:53.170
because I know you've always wanted kids

41:53.220 --> 41:55.690
and you've always resented
the fact that I didn't...

41:55.740 --> 41:58.410
- Marion. - .. but I really
think you need to leave now.

41:58.460 --> 42:02.300
Yeah, I really think it's time.
We're done now. We're done now.

42:08.500 --> 42:11.740
I'm gonna call your mum and Elise

42:11.820 --> 42:13.850
and ask them to come and look after you.

42:13.900 --> 42:16.570
Get you the right help, get
you back on some meds maybe.

42:16.620 --> 42:19.700
And you know, I actually think
you're right asking me to leave.

42:24.260 --> 42:27.260
I don't think I'm good
for you any more, Maz.

42:27.540 --> 42:29.680
I want too much from you.

42:30.260 --> 42:32.400
Things you can't give me.

42:37.860 --> 42:39.330
You know...

42:41.580 --> 42:43.900
.. not having children...

42:43.980 --> 42:47.540
was the hardest thing for
me, it still is some days.

42:47.620 --> 42:50.920
But I was always completely
prepared to do that...

42:51.620 --> 42:53.760
.. because I loved you...

42:56.420 --> 42:57.960
.. love you.

43:10.980 --> 43:12.320
I dunno.

43:13.220 --> 43:16.300
Oh, it's been a few years now.

43:16.380 --> 43:19.480
Do you know what? I just...
I just think you...

43:19.900 --> 43:24.620
.. you sort of forget why you
might be attractive to anyone.

43:27.020 --> 43:29.100
You... I...

43:29.180 --> 43:31.120
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

43:32.500 --> 43:34.220
I mean...

43:34.300 --> 43:35.890
you know, if no-one is telling you,

43:35.940 --> 43:39.460
you don't go around
telling yourself, do you?

43:39.540 --> 43:44.140
Right, right, cos... that would
be a bad thing, wouldn't it?

43:46.340 --> 43:47.540
Oh...

43:48.740 --> 43:51.330
For what it's worth, I
think you're attractive.

43:51.380 --> 43:53.330
- Oh, gosh, shut up now.
- No, I do.

43:53.380 --> 43:55.730
Yes, well, that would
be because you're drunk.

43:55.780 --> 43:58.050
No, it's because you, you...

43:59.260 --> 44:01.930
.. because you're funny and clever...

44:04.380 --> 44:06.050
.. and kind...

44:07.540 --> 44:09.210
.. and pretty.

44:10.100 --> 44:12.660
Am I? Fuck, I sound fantastic.

44:14.380 --> 44:16.900
Well, yeah. Yeah, you are.

44:26.420 --> 44:29.580
Oh, no. No...

44:29.660 --> 44:32.130
Shit, sorry. No, no, I wasn't, I wasn't...

44:32.180 --> 44:35.300
- No, absolutely. Nor was I.
- Sure.

44:35.380 --> 44:37.740
Erm... but, Cassie, sit down.

44:37.820 --> 44:40.010
No, I've... I've got to shoot cos erm...

44:40.060 --> 44:43.000
- Please, sit.
- No, look, it's all good.

44:43.060 --> 44:45.400
I'll see you tomorrow, Sunny.

45:21.860 --> 45:24.140
Sunny! I need to talk you.

45:24.220 --> 45:25.490

45:25.540 --> 45:28.410

45:28.460 --> 45:31.210
No, there's no reason why you
should feel in any way...

45:31.260 --> 45:33.290
- No, not for me, for you.
- Oh, right, yeah.

45:33.340 --> 45:35.490
- It's about the case.

45:35.540 --> 45:38.940

45:39.020 --> 45:42.020
- I think I can see a

45:42.700 --> 45:44.820

there are gonna be more bodies.

45:47.305 --> 45:53.627
