[intense music]

00:44.653 --> 00:48.091
[light instrumental music]

01:43.320 --> 01:46.236
[Man] Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.718
- While pride is
considered a serious sin,

01:49.761 --> 01:51.589
it is not always a bad thing

01:51.633 --> 01:54.462
to be prideful about
your work ethic.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.855
As long as it doesn't
make you arrogant

01:56.899 --> 02:00.120
and lead you into temptation.

02:00.163 --> 02:01.512
- Yes, Father.

02:01.556 --> 02:05.560
[mysterious instrumental music]

02:23.534 --> 02:26.842
- Let me tell you
the story of two men.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.845
This is a story of where

02:29.888 --> 02:32.891
pride led to arrogance
and betrayal.

02:56.350 --> 02:59.048
[dramatic music]

03:01.355 --> 03:03.879
It's the story of
Abraham and Isaac,

03:03.922 --> 03:06.316
two friends who
owned restaurants.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.971
Abraham owned one restaurant,

03:09.014 --> 03:10.320
a very good restaurant,

03:10.364 --> 03:11.321
the locals loved it,

03:11.365 --> 03:13.845
it had a personal touch.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.847
Isaac owned three restaurants.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.849
They agreed with one another

03:17.893 --> 03:20.548
that they should
form a partnership

03:20.591 --> 03:23.725
and that would be good
for all of the eateries.

03:23.768 --> 03:24.943
- But that's not what happened.

03:24.987 --> 03:28.251
- No, because
Isaac became greedy

03:28.295 --> 03:30.819
He gave Abraham a contract

03:30.862 --> 03:33.952
that was filled with
legal clauses that were

03:33.996 --> 03:35.954
not in Abraham's interest.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.870
Being the trusting
soul that he was,

03:38.914 --> 03:41.046
Abraham did not get a
lawyer to overlook it

03:41.090 --> 03:43.832
and just signed the
contract never suspecting

03:43.875 --> 03:45.964
that his old friend Isaac
would ever swindle him.

03:48.445 --> 03:51.318
Came to pass that, indeed,

03:51.361 --> 03:54.886
Abraham was swindled
out of his restaurant.

03:55.931 --> 03:59.935
[mysterious instrumental music]

04:07.986 --> 04:09.684
Isaac took advantage of him

04:09.727 --> 04:11.294
and in the end,

04:11.338 --> 04:15.037
Abraham had to sell
his restaurant to Isaac

04:15.080 --> 04:18.954
at a fraction of the
cost of its actual value.

04:18.997 --> 04:20.172
- Be a man!

04:20.216 --> 04:21.783
[Father] Abraham
had nowhere to turn.

04:21.826 --> 04:24.655
All he could do
was appeal to God.

04:24.699 --> 04:29.312
And God does not appreciate
this kind of behavior.

04:29.356 --> 04:33.621
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's goods."

04:33.664 --> 04:37.015
[light dramatic music]

05:06.001 --> 05:07.524
[Kyle]
I understand, Father.

05:07.742 --> 05:11.006
- Alright, my son,
for your penance,

05:11.049 --> 05:14.357
I give you three Hail
Marys and four Our Fathers

05:14.401 --> 05:17.578
and advise you to sit in
the middle of the third pew.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.188
There you shall
have the plenitude

05:19.231 --> 05:23.105
of forgiveness for your penance
and for your good works.

05:23.148 --> 05:25.020
Go now and sin no more.

05:26.761 --> 05:29.546
- Thank you, Father.
- Yes, my son.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.399

06:13.155 --> 06:14.330

06:20.031 --> 06:23.034
[suspenseful music]

06:36.134 --> 06:38.398
[man grunts]

06:42.227 --> 06:45.622
- What the fuck?
[bell jingles]

06:45.666 --> 06:46.971
[Kyle]
Sorry, sir.

06:47.015 --> 06:47.755
- Hey, can't you
read the sign? We're closed!

06:47.798 --> 06:49.060
- I understand

06:49.104 --> 06:50.410
and I'm really sorry to
bother, man, I just been

06:51.976 --> 06:54.065
walking around for quite some
time, I got a little lost.

06:54.109 --> 06:56.024
Your place is the first place
I seen with the lights on.

07:00.289 --> 07:01.421
- Hey, man, I told
you, we're closed.

07:01.464 --> 07:02.683
- Yeah, I understand
that, my man,

07:02.726 --> 07:04.162
I'm just really,
really thirsty.

07:04.206 --> 07:05.860
I was just hoping you can
give me a glass of water?

07:06.251 --> 07:08.036
I'll pay for it.

07:09.385 --> 07:11.387
- I appreciate you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:23.051 --> 07:25.445
[tense music]

07:30.014 --> 07:33.104
- Come on, hurry it up, I
wanna get out of here, huh?

07:36.020 --> 07:37.326
- Aw man, how much I owe you?

07:37.369 --> 07:38.370
- You don't owe me anything,

07:38.414 --> 07:39.720
now hit the road, will ya?

07:39.763 --> 07:41.069
- I'm good?

07:41.112 --> 07:42.723
- Now don't let the door
hit you on your way out!

[Woman] We're gonna
go to the store,

08:00.088 --> 08:01.481
we're gonna get the toy, chill.

08:04.875 --> 08:05.485
[Bell on door jingles]

08:05.528 --> 08:07.051
- What is this!?

08:07.095 --> 08:08.400
- Hey honey, sit right here,

08:08.444 --> 08:11.534
I'm gonna be back
in just a second.

08:11.578 --> 08:12.927
Mr. Freedman, I'm so sorry,

08:12.970 --> 08:14.494
I really need to talk
to you about my check.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.715
- I already told you,
I'm not the fucking bank.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.282
I don't do loans.

08:23.198 --> 08:24.634
Yeah, you're not, look,

08:24.678 --> 08:26.244
you're not only a lazy bitch,

08:26.288 --> 08:28.812
but you don't fucking listen!

08:34.688 --> 08:35.950
That's not my
problem, Stephanie.

08:35.993 --> 08:37.995
- I'll do whatever
you ask, please.

08:46.134 --> 08:49.354
[somber string music]

09:50.285 --> 09:53.418
[soft piano music]

10:17.051 --> 10:18.966
- So let me get this straight.

10:19.009 --> 10:21.316
You don't have a
father, no grandparents,

10:21.359 --> 10:23.753
no aunts, uncles,
no family at all

10:23.797 --> 10:26.190
and you don't go to school.

10:26.234 --> 10:27.017
- I guess.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.805
My mom homeschools me,

10:31.848 --> 10:33.763
and when she has to go to work

10:33.807 --> 10:37.245
I stay at home or get dropped
off at the playground.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.595
- You know you can't
stay here, right?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.466
- But you brought me here!

10:41.510 --> 10:42.772
- Don't be a smart-ass.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.818
- You're not supposed to curse.

10:44.861 --> 10:46.776
- Your mom never cursed?

10:46.820 --> 10:48.909
- She did, but she
was trying to stop.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.650
She said it was a addition.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.347
- You mean addiction.

10:52.390 --> 10:53.478
- Yeah.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.263
- Cursing is not
an addiction.

10:55.306 --> 10:57.352
- But that's what
she said it was.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.440
She was trying to stop,

10:58.483 --> 11:00.877
so she could set
an example for me.

11:01.704 --> 11:04.054
Is...is my mom dead?

11:04.098 --> 11:05.882
- Enough with the questions.

11:05.926 --> 11:07.710
In fact, that's one of the
rules you need to follow, OK?

11:07.754 --> 11:09.886
Don't ask questions,
you understand?

11:10.495 --> 11:12.106
Do you understand?

11:16.937 --> 11:20.549
I guess you can stay
here, but only tonight.

11:36.739 --> 11:39.699
- Can you at least tell
me a bedtime story?

11:55.366 --> 11:58.761
- There was these two
restaurant owners.

12:01.242 --> 12:04.636
One of them betrayed
the other, the end.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.638
- That's the story?

12:06.682 --> 12:08.205
Who told you that story?

12:08.249 --> 12:09.511
[Kyle] Your
dad, now go to sleep.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.469
- Wait, can you tell
me another story?

12:11.513 --> 12:12.732
[Kyle]
Good night!

12:24.352 --> 12:25.919

12:25.962 --> 12:28.486

12:28.530 --> 12:29.749
[Man]
No mercy!

12:32.012 --> 12:34.492
[Father] You're going to
be doing God's work, my son.

12:34.536 --> 12:38.061
And your father will be
fine, everything is fine.

12:38.105 --> 12:42.326
[Men] We serve God and
execute the ones who do wrong.

12:43.588 --> 12:44.938
[body thuds]

12:44.981 --> 12:47.941
[Man] In this gift, you
will find money, photos,

12:47.984 --> 12:49.420
time and location

12:49.464 --> 12:50.987
and the way God has
called for you--

12:51.031 --> 12:53.207
[Men] We shall not
question God's way

12:53.250 --> 12:54.338
and never share it.

12:54.382 --> 12:55.775
[Kyle]
Or tell about our doing.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.298
[Kyle]
Get out now! Get out!

12:57.341 --> 12:58.865
[kid screaming]

12:58.908 --> 12:59.430
- Matthew!

13:00.692 --> 13:01.998
[Kyle] Or risk
the punishment of the Almighty.

14:21.599 --> 14:27.301
[tense music]

14:44.622 --> 14:47.669
[drink drizzling]

14:51.891 --> 14:54.589
[glass shatters]

14:56.896 --> 14:58.462
- Is everything OK?

14:58.506 --> 14:59.507
[Kyle] Yeah.

14:59.550 --> 15:01.726
- Did you break a glass?

15:07.645 --> 15:08.690
Why?

15:11.040 --> 15:12.520
- It helps me relax.

15:12.563 --> 15:14.957
- Why am I on a garbage bag?

15:15.827 --> 15:17.873
Did I pee on your couch?

15:17.917 --> 15:18.700
- No.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.834
- Then why am I--
- What's the rule?

15:22.878 --> 15:24.053
Get over here.

15:25.315 --> 15:26.490
What's the rule?

15:26.534 --> 15:27.839
- No questions.

15:31.713 --> 15:34.542
When I get upset, I
think of good memories,

15:34.585 --> 15:37.371
and that really relaxes me.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.068
- I don't have
any good memories.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.549
- Everyone at least has one.

15:43.029 --> 15:43.855
- Not me.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.323
[Father] Sit down.

16:17.454 --> 16:19.979
- Thank you, Father,
for seeing me.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.590
- How can I help
you, my good man?

16:22.633 --> 16:25.767
- It's about the situation

16:25.810 --> 16:27.769
that I need taken care of.
- I see.

16:27.812 --> 16:31.991
Did you bring me information
that I asked you for?

16:36.082 --> 16:36.996
- Yes, sir.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.791
- I think we can
be of some help.

16:51.184 --> 16:52.794
- Thank you, Father.

16:54.100 --> 16:54.926
Thank you.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.277
- Go with God.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.713
-Thank you.

17:14.685 --> 17:18.733
- Embrace your will in
the Almighty's glory.

17:25.827 --> 17:26.828
[door clicks]

17:28.089 --> 17:29.570
- Where are you going?

17:29.613 --> 17:30.440
- Work.

17:30.484 --> 17:31.876
- What do you do for work?

17:31.920 --> 17:33.052
- It's none of
your business.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.446
- Aren't you dropping me
off at the playground?

17:36.490 --> 17:37.795
- Later. Listen.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.710
Don't make any noise.

17:39.754 --> 17:41.538
Don't play the TV too loud.

17:41.582 --> 17:42.713
If anyone comes to the door,

17:42.757 --> 17:44.063
pretend like you
didn't hear it.

17:44.498 --> 17:45.934
No one needs to
know you're here.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.022
- Why?

17:49.503 --> 17:50.895
- I'll be back.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.038
- How was your
day today, my son?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.387
- It was good.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.041
Successful, Father.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.261
- Very good. Any problems?

18:10.524 --> 18:12.091
- There was a kid

18:12.134 --> 18:14.310
waiting outside
for his mom.

18:14.354 --> 18:15.572
He lost her
inside so--

18:15.616 --> 18:16.791
[Radio Reporter]
...exploded earlier today.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.097
[Kyle] Took him
home for the night.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.272
[Radio Reporter]
Casualties were minimal.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.056
However, there
have been reports--

18:21.100 --> 18:24.886
[Father] We could've taken
him in as we took you in.

18:24.929 --> 18:25.756
[Kyle] I thought
about that, Father,

18:25.800 --> 18:27.976
but he's a weak kid.

18:28.019 --> 18:30.457
And on top of it, he has family
that would've missed him so

18:30.500 --> 18:35.070
I thought it'd be best if I
just take him home to them.

18:35.114 --> 18:35.897
- Too bad.

18:38.334 --> 18:39.118
Alright.

18:40.945 --> 18:44.645
Let me tell you the
story of a man named Nick

18:44.688 --> 18:46.908
who was in a big law firm

18:46.951 --> 18:50.303
and who would use any
method he could devise

18:50.346 --> 18:52.740
for advancement, he
had no compunctions

18:52.783 --> 18:55.395
about doing things
illegal and immoral

18:55.438 --> 18:57.658
so that he could
rise up the ladder.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.225
He had another failing,

18:59.268 --> 19:03.403
that of campaigning for
one-night escapades with women.

19:05.535 --> 19:08.190
[woman giggling]

19:10.801 --> 19:13.891
It came to pass that
one of these episodes

19:13.935 --> 19:16.503
turned into a longer
lasting thing,

19:16.546 --> 19:19.462
and the terrible thing was

19:19.506 --> 19:22.683
that she was the wife
of one of the partners

19:22.726 --> 19:23.901
in the law firm.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.385
Her husband, Eric,

19:29.429 --> 19:32.214
seeing that his wife was
pulling away from him,

19:32.258 --> 19:34.825
hired a private
investigator,

19:34.869 --> 19:37.393
and the private
investigator gave him proof

19:37.437 --> 19:39.787
of his wife's
infidelities.

19:48.491 --> 19:52.060
So he had no option
but to turn to God.

19:52.103 --> 19:56.238
And God disapproves of this
kind of behavior mightily.

19:56.282 --> 20:00.416
"Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's wife."

20:00.460 --> 20:02.331
- I understand, Father.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.159
- Very good.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.813
For your penance I give you

20:05.856 --> 20:08.511
two Hail Marys and
three Our Fathers

20:08.555 --> 20:12.950
and you would be well advised
to sit in the second pew

20:12.994 --> 20:16.911
closer to God in the center
section in the middle.

20:16.954 --> 20:19.043
Go with God,
say no more.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.656
[dramatic music]

21:36.686 --> 21:39.167
Hey, you live
in 1202, right?

21:42.039 --> 21:42.823
Yeah.

21:44.955 --> 21:47.349
Yeah, I live in the
apartment across from you.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.092
I know.

22:06.107 --> 22:07.891
[door clicks] [TV Reporter] It is 27 year-old

22:07.935 --> 22:11.721
Elizabeth Stevenson, a
nurse at Kingdom Psych.

22:16.117 --> 22:19.033
- I promise I didn't
turn the TV too loud.

22:19.076 --> 22:20.426
- Good, did you take a shower?

22:20.469 --> 22:22.515
- I'm not dirty.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.038
- Go take a shower

22:24.081 --> 22:25.779
and leave your clothes
outside the bathroom.

22:27.389 --> 22:28.172
- Fine.

22:44.972 --> 22:48.105
[shower sounds]

23:03.251 --> 23:06.210
[dryer whirring]

23:21.835 --> 23:23.619
My clothes are wet!

23:23.663 --> 23:25.099
[Kyle]
They'll dry, come here.

23:25.142 --> 23:26.666
- But my--
- Put this on.

23:26.709 --> 23:29.059
- How will--
- Turn around.

23:30.321 --> 23:31.975
- What is it?
What is that?

23:32.019 --> 23:33.455
- I'm gonna put this
in your pocket, OK?

23:33.499 --> 23:35.152
- What is it?
- It's a gift.

23:35.196 --> 23:36.980
Turn around, let's go.

23:40.506 --> 23:43.247
- Why don't you have any pets?

23:43.291 --> 23:45.162
Do you work a lot?

23:45.206 --> 23:48.122
Do you think you can't take
care of a dog or a cat?

23:48.165 --> 23:50.472
Maybe we could get a fish.

23:50.516 --> 23:51.952
Or maybe a bird?

23:54.781 --> 23:56.739
And what do
you do for work?

23:56.783 --> 23:59.568
Are you a doctor,
lawyer, fireman?

24:01.527 --> 24:04.399
It's probably a job where
you work long hours,

24:04.443 --> 24:07.010
which is why you
don't have any pets

24:07.054 --> 24:08.838
and a messy apartment.

24:11.362 --> 24:13.626
I can stay with
you if you want.

24:13.669 --> 24:16.455
I can be helpful
around the house.

24:17.673 --> 24:20.241
Then you won't have
to do it yourself

24:20.284 --> 24:21.721
or hire a maid.

24:21.764 --> 24:23.157
- I'm dropping you
off at the bus stop.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.072
If a cop or someone
asks you what happened,

24:25.115 --> 24:26.073
tell them exactly what
went down yesterday

24:26.116 --> 24:27.640
at the restaurant.

24:27.683 --> 24:29.163
You lost your mom and
you have nowhere to stay.

24:29.206 --> 24:31.252
You could even tell them a
black man took you to his house,

24:31.295 --> 24:33.428
gave you food and money,
but that's it, capiche?

24:33.472 --> 24:34.647
- What's capiche?

24:34.690 --> 24:36.083
- Do you understand?

24:36.126 --> 24:38.259
- But I don't wanna go,
I wanna stay with you.

24:38.302 --> 24:39.521
- You can't stay with me,

24:39.565 --> 24:42.263
I don't like company,
I don't like kids.

24:42.306 --> 24:43.743
- Nobody likes me.

24:43.786 --> 24:44.570
- Hey.

24:47.268 --> 24:49.139
I'm sure a lot of
people like you.

24:49.183 --> 24:50.271
I just like to be alone.

24:50.314 --> 24:52.621
It has nothing
to do with you.

24:53.622 --> 24:55.276
Come on, let's go.

25:00.020 --> 25:00.760
Sit down.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.807
You remember what I said?

25:06.635 --> 25:07.941
Good luck, kid.

[horns honking]

25:43.324 --> 25:47.067
[mysterious ambient music]

25:59.949 --> 26:04.127
[Boy] I knew you were
going to come back for me!

26:04.171 --> 26:05.607
- I didn't know I
was coming back.

26:05.651 --> 26:10.438
- I did, my mom said it
was called int, intu--

26:11.395 --> 26:12.875
- Intuition.

26:12.919 --> 26:13.920
- Yeah, that.

26:13.963 --> 26:15.661
Anyway, I promise
I'll be good.

26:15.704 --> 26:18.141
- Listen, if you're gonna
stay another night or two,

26:18.185 --> 26:20.448
because make no mistake,
this isn't permanent.

26:20.491 --> 26:22.581
There's a couple of
rules you need to follow.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.626
One, no questions.

26:24.670 --> 26:27.890
Non-negotiable.
Non-negotiable!

26:27.934 --> 26:30.501
Two, there's no
toys, no cartoons.

26:30.545 --> 26:32.112
And three, you eat
what I give you.

26:32.155 --> 26:34.549
There's no menu, you got it?

26:34.593 --> 26:35.332
Got it?

26:35.376 --> 26:35.985
-Yeah.

26:36.029 --> 26:37.204
- Walk.

26:49.869 --> 26:51.305
- Hey, neighbor.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.179
I didn't know
you had a kid.

26:56.223 --> 26:59.269
- I don't, I'm just watching
him for a couple of days.

26:59.313 --> 27:00.880
- Oh, well that's
nice of you.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.883
Hi, I'm Tara.

27:04.361 --> 27:05.972
- I'm Matthew.

27:06.015 --> 27:09.279
- [chuckles] It's nice
to meet you, cutie.

27:09.323 --> 27:10.411
I don't mean to be rude,

27:10.454 --> 27:12.369
but I've got an
audition to get to.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.154
Maybe I'll see
you guys around.

27:16.069 --> 27:17.418
- She's nice.

27:17.461 --> 27:21.074
- Rule number four, no
talking to the neighbors.

27:21.117 --> 27:22.510
Let's go.
[Matthew groans]

27:29.299 --> 27:32.085
[drink pouring]

27:38.047 --> 27:39.048
I have to go to work.

27:39.092 --> 27:40.702
- But you just went to work!

27:40.746 --> 27:42.356
- I have to go back to work.

27:42.399 --> 27:44.706
- You didn't finish
before you came home?

27:44.750 --> 27:46.403
- Had to deal
with you first.

27:46.447 --> 27:48.101
- Well what kind of
work are you able to do

27:48.144 --> 27:50.973
that you can leave and go
back whenever you want to?

27:52.496 --> 27:53.889
- It's dangerous.

27:53.933 --> 27:55.064
And I don't want
to talk about it.

27:55.108 --> 27:57.153
- Is it like a soldier?

27:57.197 --> 27:59.503
- Yeah, exactly
like a soldier.

27:59.547 --> 28:02.376
- I want to
be a soldier.

28:02.419 --> 28:03.551
- You're too young.

28:03.594 --> 28:06.772
- But I watch a lot
of soldier movies.

28:08.991 --> 28:11.428
- Trust me, you don't
want to do what I do.

28:11.472 --> 28:13.474
- How do you know that?

28:13.517 --> 28:15.041
- If you want to stay
here until I figure out

28:15.084 --> 28:16.433
what to do with you,

28:16.477 --> 28:19.872
you have to just stop
with all of the questions.

28:19.915 --> 28:22.439
- I'm naturally
curious, I'm a kid.

28:22.483 --> 28:24.398
Can you at least come
up with a certain number

28:24.441 --> 28:26.922
of questions I
can ask a day?

28:28.445 --> 28:30.752
- Fine, but not too many.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.232
- How many is too many?

28:32.275 --> 28:33.059
- Kid.

28:34.321 --> 28:36.932
- Fine, I'll stay home
and clean and when you--

28:36.976 --> 28:37.759
- No. No.

28:39.543 --> 28:40.675
Don't touch nothing
in my house,

28:40.719 --> 28:42.416
I like it just
the way it is.

28:42.459 --> 28:45.767
Just sit here, watch TV,
and don't do nothing else.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.464
- But it's just the news.

28:47.508 --> 28:48.814
- So?

28:48.857 --> 28:49.684
- I'm six.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.208
- You're never too young
to start learning about

28:52.252 --> 28:53.775
your current events.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.516
Now sit here and watch TV,

28:55.559 --> 28:57.387
don't touch nothing else.

28:58.911 --> 28:59.738
- Fine.

29:13.447 --> 29:16.276
[phone ringing]

29:22.499 --> 29:24.545
- Hey babe, what's up?

29:25.807 --> 29:27.461
Why, what's going on?

29:29.985 --> 29:32.988
Hold on, what are
you talking about?

29:35.425 --> 29:37.166
My boss?

29:37.210 --> 29:38.777
How did he find out?

29:41.562 --> 29:42.824
Shit.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.652
Alright, alright, I'm
leaving, I'm leaving.

[frantic tapping]

30:25.911 --> 30:28.478
[thudding]

30:28.522 --> 30:30.350
- Hold on a minute, OK?

30:30.393 --> 30:31.220
What do you want,
some money?

30:31.264 --> 30:32.265
Forgive me, I'm sorry

30:32.308 --> 30:33.701
it wasn't even my idea,
it was hers!

30:35.181 --> 30:37.792
- Close your eyes,
pray with me.

30:39.533 --> 30:41.404
- Pray with you, what
are you talking about?

30:41.448 --> 30:42.492
- Pray.

30:43.537 --> 30:45.844
That ye may be sincere

30:45.887 --> 30:49.325
and without offense
'til the day of Christ,

30:49.369 --> 30:52.154
being filled with the
fruits of righteousness.

31:30.540 --> 31:33.543
[blood splattering]

32:00.701 --> 32:03.878
[playful ambient music]

32:34.909 --> 32:36.345
- What happened
to your shirt?

32:36.389 --> 32:37.564
- The second I walk
through the door

32:37.607 --> 32:38.826
and already with
the questions?

32:39.261 --> 32:40.262
- Wait!

32:41.698 --> 32:44.005
[water splashing
in bathroom]

32:44.049 --> 32:45.485
- I made you dinner!

32:45.528 --> 32:47.008
- You made me what?

32:47.052 --> 32:47.878
- Dinner!

32:51.186 --> 32:54.798
Tada!
[imitates explosion]

32:54.842 --> 32:56.278
- You expect
me to eat this?

32:56.322 --> 32:58.454
- Yeah, it's everything I
could find in the kitchen.

32:58.498 --> 33:00.065
- This don't look edible.

33:00.108 --> 33:02.763
- Everything in the
kitchen's edible.

33:02.806 --> 33:03.982
- Not all mixed
together like this,

33:04.025 --> 33:05.635
look at this mess!

33:06.201 --> 33:08.421
Didn't I tell you to just
sit down and watch TV?

33:10.292 --> 33:12.729
- I was just
trying to help.

33:16.907 --> 33:19.736
- Come on, we'll
go out and eat.

33:23.566 --> 33:27.222
[lighthearted ambient music]

33:53.466 --> 33:55.033
You a big pizza fan?

33:55.946 --> 33:57.687
- It's my favorite.

34:01.082 --> 34:02.257
- If I knew this what it took

34:02.301 --> 34:03.737
to get you to stop talking,

34:03.780 --> 34:05.782
I'd have brought
you here yesterday.

34:08.089 --> 34:12.572
- My mom used to take me
to eat pizza all the time.

34:12.614 --> 34:13.833
I miss my mom.

34:19.753 --> 34:23.016
We would also play
together all the time.

34:25.411 --> 34:27.369
- What y'all used to do?

34:27.413 --> 34:29.067
- She would read to me,

34:29.110 --> 34:30.851
and we would
play with my toys,

34:30.893 --> 34:33.462
but usually we
would play games.

34:34.507 --> 34:35.507
- Like what?

34:35.551 --> 34:37.161
- The usual.

34:37.205 --> 34:38.293
Candy Land.

34:41.992 --> 34:42.775
Go Fish.

34:44.125 --> 34:48.998
My favorite
was Battleship.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.697
- I never played that one.

34:51.741 --> 34:52.525
- Really?

34:53.525 --> 34:55.092
It's awesome.

34:55.136 --> 34:57.269
If you want, we
can play tonight.

34:57.312 --> 34:59.140
- It's too late.

34:59.184 --> 35:01.186
I don't have
that game anyway.

35:03.013 --> 35:05.407
- We could use the
stuff around the house.

35:05.451 --> 35:07.670
- Games don't interest me.

35:09.890 --> 35:10.934
- Why not?

35:11.718 --> 35:13.111
- They just don't.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.679
- But everyone likes
games, they're so much fun.

35:16.723 --> 35:17.811
- I don't.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.597
- But if you don't
play with me, who will?

35:21.641 --> 35:23.860
- Use your
imagination, kid.

35:23.904 --> 35:26.124
I'm sure you think of a game
you can play by yourself.

35:29.910 --> 35:31.303
What?

35:31.346 --> 35:33.435
[Matthew] This is how we
play Battleship.

35:33.479 --> 35:36.177
You tell me a
number and a letter,

35:36.221 --> 35:38.136
and if you land
on my battleship,

35:38.179 --> 35:40.399
I tell you you exploded
a part of my ship,

35:40.442 --> 35:42.923
and if you miss,
it's my turn.

35:42.966 --> 35:44.838
And if you explode
my whole ship,

35:44.881 --> 35:46.840
I tell you you
sunk my battleship.

35:46.883 --> 35:49.059
- Kid, this is way
too complicated.

35:49.103 --> 35:50.409
You sure this is a game?

35:50.452 --> 35:52.759
- Yeah, really, I
used to have it.

35:52.802 --> 35:54.326
- I don't believe it.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.763
- Come on, it's
going to be fun.

35:56.806 --> 35:59.244
- It's never fun when
you're being blackmailed.

35:59.287 --> 36:01.202
- Blackmail, what
does that mean?

36:01.246 --> 36:02.682
- When someone forces
you into doing something

36:02.725 --> 36:04.118
against your will.

36:04.988 --> 36:06.816
- I didn't blackmail you.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.166
- You knew what
you was doing,

36:08.209 --> 36:10.255
asking all those questions
at the pizza place.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.431
You know I'd say yes to
a game if you'd shut up.

36:12.474 --> 36:14.781
- Don't worry, you'll
get better with practice.

36:14.824 --> 36:16.435
- Yeah, we'll see.

36:16.478 --> 36:17.740
I'll be back.

36:17.784 --> 36:20.265
And don't look at
none of my shit.

36:20.308 --> 36:22.789
[somber music]

36:49.729 --> 36:50.512
Matthew!

36:55.474 --> 36:56.257
Matthew!

37:10.619 --> 37:12.012
What happened?

37:12.055 --> 37:13.622
[Matthew] Nothing.

37:14.275 --> 37:17.496
-No one starts
crying for no reason.

37:17.539 --> 37:19.498
- My mom used to
tell me not to cheat

37:19.541 --> 37:21.761
when she went
to the restroom.

37:22.805 --> 37:24.024
I miss my mom.

37:28.811 --> 37:29.943
- You know...

37:31.074 --> 37:33.990
I didn't really know
my mom growing up.

37:34.034 --> 37:35.775
She passed away
giving birth to me.

37:35.818 --> 37:37.559
[Matthew] That's sad.

37:37.603 --> 37:39.431
What about your dad?

37:39.474 --> 37:41.694
- I have very little
memories of him.

37:41.737 --> 37:43.565
[Matthew] Why?

37:43.609 --> 37:46.351
- He left me at a young age.

37:46.394 --> 37:48.701
- That's sad, too.

37:48.744 --> 37:50.833
Then who raised you?

37:50.877 --> 37:53.445
-I was raised
in a church.

37:53.488 --> 37:56.056
A priest named Father Antonio

37:56.970 --> 37:59.364
took care of me, took me in,

37:59.407 --> 38:01.670
taught me how
to do God's work.

38:01.714 --> 38:04.978
- You're a soldier
that works for God.

38:05.761 --> 38:06.980
- Yeah, sorta.

38:08.895 --> 38:10.984
I want to tell
you something.

38:11.027 --> 38:14.988
Sometimes when you're
feeling sad and down,

38:15.031 --> 38:19.122
good thoughts actually lift
you up and make you happier.

38:19.166 --> 38:21.560
- Hey, I told you that.

38:21.603 --> 38:23.301
- It was good advice.

38:24.998 --> 38:27.087
So those memories
you have of your mom,

38:27.130 --> 38:29.655
you gotta hold on to 'em,

38:29.698 --> 38:33.136
and remember,
soldiers never cry.

38:33.180 --> 38:36.705
- I will be a good
soldier and I won't cry,

38:36.749 --> 38:38.968
and I'll find out
who killed my mom

38:39.012 --> 38:40.709
and kill them back.

38:42.581 --> 38:44.626
So, you wanna
finish Battleship?

38:44.670 --> 38:46.324
-Oh, no.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.630
I had enough of your
cheating for one night.

38:48.674 --> 38:50.371
[Matthew] No, really,
I wasn't cheating!

38:50.415 --> 38:53.374
- Yes, you was, I said
5A like three times.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.898
One time you said yes,
another time you said no.

38:55.942 --> 38:57.987
I know you wasn't
telling me the truth.

38:58.031 --> 38:59.728
- Really, I wasn't cheating!

38:59.772 --> 39:01.077
- Nah, not tonight.

39:01.121 --> 39:03.210
And besides, I got
a long day tomorrow.

39:03.253 --> 39:04.777
I need to sleep on and
figure out my strategy

39:04.820 --> 39:06.431
on how I'ma beat you.

39:06.474 --> 39:10.043
- You'll never beat
me, I rock this game!

39:10.086 --> 39:11.566
- We'll see.

39:11.610 --> 39:13.394
- So, you ready to go?

39:23.143 --> 39:26.059
[wind whooshing]

39:43.032 --> 39:45.948
[locks clicking]

39:48.386 --> 39:49.778
[locks clicking]

40:00.354 --> 40:03.401
You're going to leave me
here with no food again?

40:03.444 --> 40:05.185
- What are you talking about,
there's plenty of food.

40:05.228 --> 40:08.406
- The food you have
here is disgusting.

40:09.058 --> 40:10.408
- It's healthy.

40:11.626 --> 40:14.063
Find something here
to eat, I gotta go.

40:19.417 --> 40:20.287
- Oh, wait!

40:25.074 --> 40:26.467
Yes!

40:26.511 --> 40:29.078
[playful music]

41:10.119 --> 41:12.861
- Hey kid, you got enough
money for all that?

41:12.905 --> 41:13.862
- If I didn't,
would I have

41:13.906 --> 41:16.386
put all this stuff
in the cart?

41:16.430 --> 41:17.475
- Well, you know,
I just don't wanna

41:17.518 --> 41:18.954
go and ring
all this up

41:18.998 --> 41:21.043
and then have to
void it in the end.

41:21.087 --> 41:23.698
- Got any more questions?

41:23.742 --> 41:26.614
[chuckles]

41:26.658 --> 41:29.051
- Mm, you should be in
school, shouldn't you?

41:29.095 --> 41:30.575
- School holiday.

41:31.663 --> 41:33.142
- Yeah, which one?

41:33.186 --> 41:35.449
- You ask too
many questions.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.016
Oh, now I get it.

41:42.195 --> 41:43.413
- Hey, cutie.

41:43.457 --> 41:44.371
- Hey.

41:44.414 --> 41:46.242
- You shopping
all by yourself?

41:46.286 --> 41:49.071
- I was just
wondering that myself.

41:49.115 --> 41:51.334
- Oh, well, he lives
in my building,

41:51.378 --> 41:52.597
although you probably
couldn't tell

41:52.640 --> 41:55.121
'cause he's not
being very friendly.

41:55.164 --> 41:58.298
- Kyle told me not to
talk to the neighbors.

41:58.341 --> 41:59.081
- How come?

41:59.125 --> 42:00.561
- I don't know,

42:00.605 --> 42:02.520
probably doesn't want me
to annoy them or something.

42:02.737 --> 42:05.348
- How are you gonna get
all that home by yourself?

42:07.350 --> 42:08.874
Look, I bet he
wouldn't mind you

42:08.917 --> 42:11.703
talking to me long enough
until we get this home, right?

42:12.704 --> 42:15.315
So your parents went
on vacation, huh?

42:16.316 --> 42:17.535
Yeah.

42:17.578 --> 42:19.537
I haven't been on
vacation in years.

42:21.539 --> 42:22.931
Why? How come?

42:23.758 --> 42:26.282
Well, leading the life
of a starving artist

42:26.326 --> 42:28.241
doesn't give
you much money.

42:28.284 --> 42:29.155
You hungry?

42:29.198 --> 42:30.722
You can come
eat with me.

42:30.765 --> 42:32.027
[chuckling]

42:32.071 --> 42:34.116
No, a starving
artist is someone

42:34.160 --> 42:36.597
who wants to work
in entertainment

42:36.641 --> 42:38.294
and doesn't have
a good paying job

42:38.338 --> 42:40.340
while they wait for
their big break.

42:40.383 --> 42:43.517
[Matthew] Why would
anyone wanna think of that?

42:43.561 --> 42:47.390
I'm starting to ask
myself that every day.

42:48.914 --> 42:52.352
I want to be a soldier
when I grow up.

42:53.483 --> 42:55.181
Isn't that a
bit dangerous?

42:55.224 --> 42:58.227
I know, but I'm
going to be a good one.

42:58.271 --> 43:00.447
So you decided to skip
police officer and cowboy

43:00.490 --> 43:04.277
and just go straight
for soldier, huh?

43:04.320 --> 43:07.236
I dig it, shows a
lot of character.

43:08.934 --> 43:10.413
What's character?

43:12.372 --> 43:16.594
Character is the traits and
qualities that make you you.

43:19.161 --> 43:21.381
Like shopping by
yourself in the store.

43:21.424 --> 43:23.252
That makes you
independent,

43:23.296 --> 43:26.734
and asking a girl
if she's hungry

43:26.778 --> 43:30.303
and wants something to
eat, well, that's kindness.

43:30.346 --> 43:32.087
You know, you're
well on your way

43:32.131 --> 43:35.003
to becoming a
good man, Matthew.

43:35.047 --> 43:36.657
I dig it.

43:36.701 --> 43:39.007
[chuckles]

43:48.234 --> 43:50.236
- Remember to pray, son.

44:02.770 --> 44:04.598
- Where'd you
get the food?

44:04.642 --> 44:06.426
- I went to the store.

44:07.688 --> 44:09.211
- You make one of your
inedible messes again?

44:09.255 --> 44:12.650
- You should probably
be more encouraging.

44:13.781 --> 44:15.000
Don't be mad at him,

44:15.043 --> 44:16.218
we ran into each
other at the store,

44:16.262 --> 44:17.480
he needed some
help with his bags.

44:17.524 --> 44:19.439
- It's not my fault,
I told her that

44:19.482 --> 44:22.268
you told me not to
talk to neighbors.

44:22.311 --> 44:23.791
- Really, I don't mind.

44:23.835 --> 44:25.445
It gets lonely around here.

44:25.488 --> 44:27.229
It's nice to have
someone to talk to.

44:27.273 --> 44:28.143
- That's great.

44:28.187 --> 44:30.363
- Come on, try it.

44:30.406 --> 44:31.669
- I'm not trying to
get food poisoning.

44:31.712 --> 44:32.887
- I'll try it.

44:36.586 --> 44:37.370
Mm.

44:38.850 --> 44:40.112
That's pretty good.

44:40.155 --> 44:42.462
- See, I told you
it wouldn't be bad.

44:42.505 --> 44:44.856
- I'm gonna take mine and
go now that Kyle's back.

44:44.899 --> 44:46.640
[Matthew]
Aw, do you have to?

44:46.684 --> 44:49.338
- I'm sure she got more
important things to do, kid.

44:49.382 --> 44:50.775
- Actually I don't.

44:50.818 --> 44:52.602
It's sad, I know.

44:52.646 --> 44:54.256
Look, if you ever need
someone to watch him

44:54.300 --> 44:55.257
or take him out
while he's here,

44:55.301 --> 44:56.476
I'd be happy to do it.

44:56.519 --> 44:59.305
- Oh, no, that
won't be necessary.

45:01.350 --> 45:03.309
- See you guys later.

45:05.224 --> 45:07.095
- I promise it
wasn't my fault.

45:07.139 --> 45:08.618
- I don't want you
talking to the neighbors.

45:08.662 --> 45:11.447
- But we only talked
about stuff we like doing.

45:11.491 --> 45:13.536
We didn't talk
about my mom.

45:13.580 --> 45:15.364
Oh, and that cashier lady,

45:15.408 --> 45:17.932
she was asking like
a hundred questions.

45:17.976 --> 45:20.065
Then I understood why
you didn't want me to ask

45:20.108 --> 45:22.067
so many questions.

45:22.110 --> 45:23.372
- So does that mean--

45:23.416 --> 45:26.332
- Yes, I'll try not to
ask so many questions.

45:26.375 --> 45:27.289
- Good.

45:27.333 --> 45:29.901
- Oh, and I bought a DVD.

45:29.944 --> 45:31.729
But you don't
have a DVD player.

45:31.772 --> 45:33.121
- Who needs a DVD player?

45:33.165 --> 45:33.948
- I do!

45:35.341 --> 45:37.169
I'm getting
bored of the news.

45:37.212 --> 45:38.605
It's depressing.

45:38.648 --> 45:41.434
- True, but it's
also educational.

45:42.565 --> 45:44.089
What kind of
DVD did you buy?

45:44.132 --> 45:45.525
I know not cartoons.

45:45.568 --> 45:46.439
- Well.

45:46.482 --> 45:47.570
- If you want to be a soldier,

45:47.614 --> 45:49.268
you can't watch cartoons.

45:49.311 --> 45:50.922
- Everybody watches cartoons.

45:50.965 --> 45:51.792
- I didn't.

45:51.836 --> 45:52.967
- You didn't play games,

45:53.011 --> 45:54.360
you didn't watch cartoons,

45:54.403 --> 45:56.449
what did you do
when you were a kid?

45:56.492 --> 45:57.363
- I studied.

45:57.406 --> 45:58.451
- Boring.

45:59.800 --> 46:01.367
What are we going
to do tonight?

46:01.410 --> 46:03.021
- I have to go to work.

46:03.064 --> 46:04.587
- You're going to
be a soldier again?

46:04.631 --> 46:06.111
Can I come?

46:06.154 --> 46:07.677
- I told you, you're too
young and it's too dangerous.

46:07.721 --> 46:10.158
- If you let me come I
could be very helpful.

46:10.202 --> 46:11.594
- I don't want you to help.

46:11.638 --> 46:12.682
I want you to just stay
here and watch the house,

46:12.726 --> 46:14.206
can you do that for me?

46:15.033 --> 46:16.208
- Yes.

46:18.906 --> 46:20.690
- This is your
mission, cadet.

46:20.734 --> 46:23.345
I need you to stay
here, watch the house,

46:23.389 --> 46:25.739
make sure no one comes
in and steals anything.

46:25.783 --> 46:27.088
Can you do that for me?

46:27.132 --> 46:28.568
- Yes, sir!

46:28.611 --> 46:29.830
- Can I count on you, cadet?

46:29.874 --> 46:31.614
- Aye aye, captain!

46:33.442 --> 46:34.487
- That's a pirate.

46:34.530 --> 46:37.316
- Oh, I mean, yes, sir!

46:37.359 --> 46:39.797
- Soldiers always start
out with a small task,

46:39.840 --> 46:41.450
and if you could
do this for me,

46:41.494 --> 46:43.670
after a while, I'll give you
a more dangerous assignment.

46:43.713 --> 46:44.453
OK?

46:44.497 --> 46:45.237
- OK.

46:45.541 --> 46:46.542
- OK.

47:04.647 --> 47:06.562
Good morning, Father.

47:06.606 --> 47:07.955
- Good morning, my son.

47:07.999 --> 47:09.435
Are you alright?

47:10.958 --> 47:12.699
- Yeah, why do you ask?

47:12.742 --> 47:14.701
- You sound different.

47:14.744 --> 47:17.922
- What do you
mean? I'm fine.

47:17.965 --> 47:20.576
- I can tell when something
is weighing on your soul.

47:21.577 --> 47:25.494
- No, I'm good, it's
just, just a little tired,

47:26.582 --> 47:28.149
I guess you can say.

47:29.237 --> 47:30.499
- Why is that?

47:31.587 --> 47:33.676
- I was, uh, couple
parties going on

47:33.720 --> 47:37.550
at my apartment,
loud neighbors.

47:38.551 --> 47:41.119
- Now you must understand
that your body is God's body

47:41.162 --> 47:43.599
and you have to respect
it and get sleep.

47:44.296 --> 47:47.560
- Yes, Father, do you
have a story for me today?

47:47.603 --> 47:49.475
[Father]
Yes, I do.

47:49.518 --> 47:52.217
[dramatic music]

47:58.484 --> 48:00.965
This is the story
of a young boy

48:01.008 --> 48:03.576
who was taken in
when he had no one

48:03.619 --> 48:05.491
and nowhere to turn.

48:05.534 --> 48:09.669
He was taken in by
a good and holy man

48:09.712 --> 48:13.760
who treated him like a
son, took care of him

48:13.803 --> 48:18.721
so that he was fed well
and taken care of properly.

48:18.765 --> 48:21.507
The boy had trust issues,

48:21.550 --> 48:24.597
but after a while he came
to trust the holy man

48:24.640 --> 48:28.470
and became very close
together, very close.

48:29.689 --> 48:32.344
And the young
man grew up to be

48:32.387 --> 48:34.085
a bright and
talented person,

48:34.128 --> 48:37.001
someone everyone
could be proud of.

48:43.703 --> 48:44.486
But then,

48:46.880 --> 48:48.621
he started to do
things that were not

48:48.664 --> 48:51.972
in the best interest of
the holy man's well-being.

48:53.017 --> 48:54.409
He was disloyal.

01:07:03.845 --> 01:07:06.152
- When the boss sends for you,
there's nothing you can do.

01:07:07.153 --> 01:07:09.590
I gotta go, though, so
I'll see you in a bit.

01:07:16.989 --> 01:07:19.687
- My son, thank you for
getting here so quickly.

01:07:19.731 --> 01:07:20.775
- You said it was
urgent, Father?

01:07:20.819 --> 01:07:21.863
- It is.

01:07:22.995 --> 01:07:25.302
I'm going to tell
you the story

01:07:25.345 --> 01:07:28.218
of an evil name by
the name of Sam.

01:07:28.261 --> 01:07:29.784
Sam is what is known
as a loan shark,

01:07:29.828 --> 01:07:31.047
you know what that is.

01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:32.265
-I do.

01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:34.702
- He lends money to
people at usurious rates

01:07:34.746 --> 01:07:36.791
and puts them
under great stress.

01:07:36.835 --> 01:07:40.230
They're in need, he
lends them money,

01:07:40.273 --> 01:07:43.189
but the payback is
enormous, much more

01:07:43.233 --> 01:07:45.148
than the original loan.

01:07:46.192 --> 01:07:47.802
One of his borrowers

01:07:49.152 --> 01:07:51.197
raised enough money

01:07:51.241 --> 01:07:53.852
to almost pay
this man Sam back,

01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:56.463
but not quite enough

01:07:56.507 --> 01:07:59.162
and he knows that if he
does not pay him in full

01:07:59.205 --> 01:08:01.120
by three o'clock today,

01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:04.776
he puts his family jeopardy,
his wife and his son

01:08:04.819 --> 01:08:06.517
as well as himself.

01:08:07.779 --> 01:08:09.259
- I understand, Father.

01:08:09.302 --> 01:08:11.522
- You understand that these
people are dear to me.

01:08:11.565 --> 01:08:12.740
-I do.

01:08:12.784 --> 01:08:13.828
- Alright.

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:18.920
Church, say three Our
Fathers, two Hail Marys,

01:08:18.964 --> 01:08:20.921
sit in the second pew

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:24.055
and accept God's benediction,

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:29.279
his magnificence and
plentiful apostolic blessings.

01:08:30.323 --> 01:08:32.108
Go with God, sin no more.

01:08:32.542 --> 01:08:33.544
- Thank you, Father.

01:08:34.805 --> 01:08:37.156
[tense music]

01:08:51.344 --> 01:08:53.868
- A fox fell into a well

01:08:53.912 --> 01:08:56.697
who it was not very deep,

01:08:56.741 --> 01:08:57.959
he found that.

01:09:01.876 --> 01:09:03.487
Another present for me?

01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:04.705
- No, this one's for me.

01:09:04.749 --> 01:09:06.446
I need it for work
this afternoon.

01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:08.926
- Can I come with you?

01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:10.711
I just thought if
I ask you enough,

01:09:10.755 --> 01:09:13.845
at some point you would
say yes to shut me up.

01:09:13.888 --> 01:09:15.977
- It's not happening,
so stop asking.

01:09:18.197 --> 01:09:20.720
- Can you at least drop
me off at the playground?

01:09:20.765 --> 01:09:22.723
- Can't Tara take you?

01:09:22.767 --> 01:09:25.161
- Tara has a
audition all day.

01:09:27.032 --> 01:09:28.947
- Put your jacket on.

01:09:35.867 --> 01:09:38.957
[background chatter]

01:09:44.658 --> 01:09:46.006
Be back in a couple hours.
- OK!

01:09:46.051 --> 01:09:47.792
- Don't leave and
don't talk to anybody.

01:09:47.835 --> 01:09:50.837
- Hello, I'm a pro
at this, goodbye!

01:10:16.821 --> 01:10:18.301
- We got a problem.

01:10:18.344 --> 01:10:20.303
The boy, he's
still out there.

01:10:20.346 --> 01:10:22.827
Got every department and
the FBI looking for him.

01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:24.307
You need to find him,

01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:27.266
otherwise, your whole
operation's gonna go down.

01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:30.704
I can't protect you
anymore, understand?

01:10:52.944 --> 01:10:55.860
[mysterious music]

01:11:09.874 --> 01:11:12.529
- How you doing, I have a
delivery for Mr. Sam Taylor.

01:11:12.572 --> 01:11:14.008
- Yeah, you can
leave it there.

01:11:14.052 --> 01:11:15.836
- Alright, perfect, is it
OK if I use the bathroom?

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.360
- Sure.
- Thank you.

01:11:20.972 --> 01:11:22.843
- There's a package
downstairs you need to sign,

01:11:22.887 --> 01:11:25.019
they won't let me bring
it up unless you sign it.

01:11:25.063 --> 01:11:26.064
[Receptionist]
Again?

01:11:40.905 --> 01:11:43.864
[dramatic music]

01:11:58.139 --> 01:11:59.358
Can I help you?

01:11:59.402 --> 01:12:01.795
[Matthew] Maybe, I'm
looking for my friend.

01:12:01.839 --> 01:12:02.753
[Receptionist] I don't
think your little friend

01:12:02.796 --> 01:12:04.145
came in here, sweetie.

01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:05.756
- Oh, so cute.

01:12:05.799 --> 01:12:06.583
Is he yours?

01:12:06.626 --> 01:12:08.628
- No, I think he's lost.

01:12:13.503 --> 01:12:14.721
- He's not little,

01:12:14.765 --> 01:12:17.115
he's big and he's
dressed just like me.

01:12:17.158 --> 01:12:18.377
[Receptionist] Nobody
here's dressed like you.

01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:19.509
- Look!

01:12:19.552 --> 01:12:21.032
- Let's go!
- Hey, how did you--

01:12:21.075 --> 01:12:21.946
- Wrong address.

01:12:21.989 --> 01:12:24.688
[Receptionist]
Hey, excuse me!

01:12:27.821 --> 01:12:29.083
- Where'd you
get these clothes?

01:12:30.084 --> 01:12:32.348
What was you doing there
in the first place?

01:12:33.958 --> 01:12:36.134
You hear me
talking to you?

01:12:36.177 --> 01:12:38.832
- You ask way too
many questions.

01:12:39.659 --> 01:12:41.052
Did you kill him?

01:12:41.095 --> 01:12:42.096
- What'd you say?

01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:43.097
- Did you kill him?

01:12:43.141 --> 01:12:43.924
- Hey.

01:12:48.276 --> 01:12:50.844
You don't want
to be like me.

01:12:50.888 --> 01:12:51.976
You understand?

01:12:52.803 --> 01:12:54.239
Now when we get home

01:12:54.282 --> 01:12:55.762
we gotta hurry up and pack
because we gotta go away.

01:12:55.806 --> 01:12:57.851
- Where are we going?

01:12:59.331 --> 01:13:01.333
- Change your clothes,
we leave in 10 minutes.

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:16.914
You rea--

01:13:24.356 --> 01:13:27.054
[Father] My best man and
you lied to me.

01:13:28.447 --> 01:13:29.709
You took the boy.

01:13:29.753 --> 01:13:30.971
- I was gonna tell you
about the boy, I just--

01:13:31.015 --> 01:13:32.408
Oh, no, I know what
you were going to do,

01:13:32.451 --> 01:13:33.931
it's what you
should have done.

01:13:33.974 --> 01:13:36.107
You're gonna raise this
little child in this squalor,

01:13:36.150 --> 01:13:38.849
in this awful place, is
that what you're gonna do?

01:13:38.892 --> 01:13:40.198
You should've
taken him to me.

01:13:40.241 --> 01:13:42.026
I would've taken care of
him, given him a home!

01:13:42.069 --> 01:13:44.376
- Like you took care of me?

01:13:45.377 --> 01:13:46.552
- Oh.

01:13:46.596 --> 01:13:49.033
You have complaints?

01:13:49.076 --> 01:13:50.469
Where do you think
you would've ended up

01:13:50.513 --> 01:13:52.689
if I didn't take you in
and take care of you, huh,

01:13:52.732 --> 01:13:54.734
you'd be on the
street or worse.

01:13:57.302 --> 01:13:59.652
I made you a
servant of God!

01:14:01.785 --> 01:14:04.091
And this is how
you repay me?

01:14:05.789 --> 01:14:07.007
You're coming
with me, come on.

01:14:07.878 --> 01:14:09.706
- I don't wanna go!

01:14:11.142 --> 01:14:12.317
- Very well.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.754
You have exactly
one minute.

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:24.024
- Don't worry.

01:14:24.068 --> 01:14:25.983
You're not going too far.

01:14:26.026 --> 01:14:27.114
I'll see you.

01:14:27.158 --> 01:14:29.116
- I thought I was
being good.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.118
I cleaned and swept,

01:14:31.162 --> 01:14:33.643
I did everything
you asked me to,

01:14:33.686 --> 01:14:37.124
I even stopped asking
so many questions.

01:14:38.386 --> 01:14:40.127
- Yes, you did.

01:14:40.171 --> 01:14:42.869
- So why can't I
stay with you?

01:14:42.913 --> 01:14:46.438
- Because you're going
to a better place

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:49.136
where they can take
care of you properly

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:50.573
and they have DVD players

01:14:50.616 --> 01:14:52.226
so you can actually
watch your cartoons.

01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:54.272
- I don't want to
watch cartoons,

01:14:54.315 --> 01:14:56.013
I want to
watch the news.

01:14:56.056 --> 01:14:57.057
I don't care,

01:14:57.101 --> 01:14:59.103
I just want to
stay with you!

01:14:59.146 --> 01:15:01.322
- You can't, kid.

01:15:01.366 --> 01:15:04.412
I'm not equipped to take
care of someone else.

01:15:04.456 --> 01:15:08.634
Father Antonio, he can
help you better than I can.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:13.378
- You just want
to get rid of me!

01:15:13.421 --> 01:15:15.336
Tired of me, aren't you?

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:19.993
That's the real reason why
you wanted me to pack my bags!

01:15:20.037 --> 01:15:22.692
[dramatic music]

01:15:55.768 --> 01:15:58.205
- It's alright,
from now on,

01:15:58.249 --> 01:16:00.991
everything will
be alright, son.

01:16:01.034 --> 01:16:02.514
- I'm not your son.

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:05.125
- You're upset.

01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:10.304
Of course, anyone who lost
their mother would be upset.

01:16:10.348 --> 01:16:11.436
I understand that.

01:16:12.611 --> 01:16:14.221
Do you know how you
lost your mother?

01:16:17.398 --> 01:16:18.661
She was killed.

01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:23.622
Do you know who
killed your mother?

01:16:27.104 --> 01:16:28.540
It was your friend Kyle.

01:16:31.412 --> 01:16:33.327
Sorry to tell you that.

01:16:35.155 --> 01:16:37.114
But from now on,

01:16:37.157 --> 01:16:39.464
you will be
doing God's work.

01:16:42.119 --> 01:16:45.252
You'll forget
everything and be happy

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.473
in his bountiful grace.

01:16:55.872 --> 01:16:56.873
[knocking]

01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:02.052
- You still want to
get to know me better?

01:17:09.276 --> 01:17:10.016
-Father.

01:17:11.017 --> 01:17:12.236
- Hello, boys.

01:17:13.324 --> 01:17:15.108
- We have a problem.

01:17:15.152 --> 01:17:16.066
- What problem?

01:17:16.588 --> 01:17:17.589
- It's Kyle.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:21.288
- What's the
problem with Kyle?

01:17:22.028 --> 01:17:23.421
- He took the kid.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.735
- You are to go
there now, right now

01:17:32.778 --> 01:17:34.606
and do whatever
you have to do

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.652
to get that boy and
bring him back here.

01:17:38.044 --> 01:17:39.132
- Father,
I can't, I can't--

01:17:39.176 --> 01:17:41.004
- This is not a discussion.

01:17:41.047 --> 01:17:41.831
- I--
- Now!

01:17:45.269 --> 01:17:46.487
- Yes, Father.

01:17:51.275 --> 01:17:53.277
[yells]

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:19.782
- You sleep alright?

01:18:19.825 --> 01:18:20.957
- You killed my mom!

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.088
- Hey! Relax!

01:18:23.002 --> 01:18:23.786
Relax!

01:18:37.451 --> 01:18:38.931
There's not a
day that goes by

01:18:38.975 --> 01:18:40.541
that I don't feel bad about
what happened to your mom.

01:18:40.585 --> 01:18:41.499
- You liar!

01:18:49.681 --> 01:18:51.335
- When I was your age,

01:18:51.378 --> 01:18:52.989
I was taken away
from my father.

01:18:54.904 --> 01:18:57.341
Father Antonio
told me that

01:18:57.384 --> 01:19:00.344
I'd be working for
God, serving God.

01:19:02.302 --> 01:19:03.521
So I would go and kill anybody

01:19:03.564 --> 01:19:06.089
Father Antonio asked me to

01:19:06.132 --> 01:19:10.354
because I believed that I was
killing in the name of God.

01:19:13.313 --> 01:19:15.925
And the day came when I had
to kill your mother's boss.

01:19:19.624 --> 01:19:22.105
When you two walked
in the restaurant,

01:19:22.148 --> 01:19:24.237
that day my life changed.

01:19:26.065 --> 01:19:30.200
I tried to save you and
your mom, but I couldn't.

01:19:31.549 --> 01:19:33.159
I was only
able to save you.

01:19:36.815 --> 01:19:40.514
There's nothing I can
do to fix what I did.

01:19:43.474 --> 01:19:45.084
If there is a God,

01:19:47.391 --> 01:19:49.175
I need to be punished.

01:19:50.394 --> 01:19:53.484
I've done terrible
things in my life.

01:19:55.399 --> 01:19:56.835
And right now the only
thing I care about

01:19:56.879 --> 01:19:58.271
is saving yours.

01:20:00.099 --> 01:20:02.710
[phone beeping]

01:20:05.452 --> 01:20:08.325
[foreboding music]

01:20:10.196 --> 01:20:11.545
But I promise you this,

01:20:11.589 --> 01:20:13.460
the man responsible
for killing your mom

01:20:14.244 --> 01:20:15.854
is gonna pay
for it today.

01:20:20.163 --> 01:20:22.556
[car revving]

01:20:31.783 --> 01:20:32.566
Sit down!

01:20:35.918 --> 01:20:38.834
[tires screeching]

01:20:39.617 --> 01:20:41.140
- That's so cool!

01:20:42.011 --> 01:20:45.014
[suspenseful music]

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:52.717
[tires screeching]

01:20:55.938 --> 01:20:57.287
[heavy metal music]

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:26.272
[gun fires]

01:21:33.018 --> 01:21:36.065
[gun fires]

01:21:36.108 --> 01:21:38.894
[explosion booms]

01:21:44.725 --> 01:21:47.903
[slow dramatic music]

01:22:08.401 --> 01:22:11.578
[Matthew] Wait,
please don't leave me!

01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:14.755
[Kyle]
It's OK.

01:22:29.335 --> 01:22:32.338
[suspenseful music]

01:22:38.562 --> 01:22:40.129
- I don't wanna go!

01:22:40.172 --> 01:22:41.652
- You gotta go,
OK, go, go!

01:22:41.695 --> 01:22:42.609
- But I don't want--

01:22:42.653 --> 01:22:45.351
- No, it's gonna
be OK, alright?

01:22:45.395 --> 01:22:46.352
- Kyle!
- Let's go!

01:22:46.396 --> 01:22:48.702
[Matthew]
No, Kyle help! Kyle!

01:22:58.277 --> 01:22:59.278
[loud clatter]

01:23:03.456 --> 01:23:05.067
[heavy metal music]

01:23:54.768 --> 01:23:57.380
[eerie music]

01:24:03.125 --> 01:24:05.562
[gun fires]

01:24:09.783 --> 01:24:12.047
[thudding]

01:24:21.143 --> 01:24:23.841
[flesh squishes]

01:24:28.715 --> 01:24:31.327
[neck cracks]

01:24:39.639 --> 01:24:43.121
[echoed voices chattering]

01:24:54.219 --> 01:24:58.310
[Kyle] We serve God and
execute the ones who do wrong.

01:24:58.354 --> 01:25:00.878
We shall not
question God's way

01:25:00.921 --> 01:25:03.576
and never share or
tell about our doings

01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:06.927
or risk the punishment
of the Almighty.

01:25:09.930 --> 01:25:11.889
[panting]

01:25:20.463 --> 01:25:22.900
[gun fires]

01:25:24.858 --> 01:25:26.686
- Look what
you have done.

01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:28.688
God will not forgive
you for this.

01:25:28.732 --> 01:25:30.299
- And you think
he'll forgive you?

01:25:30.342 --> 01:25:31.735
- I'm the Lord's vessel.

01:25:31.778 --> 01:25:32.649
He speaks through me,

01:25:32.692 --> 01:25:33.780
his will be done through me.

01:25:33.824 --> 01:25:35.434
- Cut the shit, Father.

01:25:35.478 --> 01:25:36.827
I see straight through you,

01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:38.829
the real you, and I'm
not buying it anymore.

01:25:38.872 --> 01:25:40.091
- Blasphemer!

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:41.658
- You old, fake,
miserable, mother--

01:25:41.701 --> 01:25:45.531
- I will not let you speak
that way to me to dishonor me.

01:25:45.575 --> 01:25:47.403
You're just
like your father.

01:25:47.446 --> 01:25:48.708
- What?

01:25:48.752 --> 01:25:49.927
- Did you think you were
the first in your family

01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:51.537
to go through
the program?

01:25:51.581 --> 01:25:52.538
How do you
think I found you?

01:25:52.582 --> 01:25:54.018
[Kyle]
No! No!

01:25:54.061 --> 01:25:56.194
- Your father and I went
through the program together

01:25:56.238 --> 01:25:59.197
back when Father Patrick was
head of the congregation.

01:25:59.241 --> 01:26:00.807
I was Father
Patrick's favorite.

01:26:00.851 --> 01:26:02.983
I stood to inherit all
of this when he died.

01:26:03.027 --> 01:26:05.682
And he died, and I
inherited all of it,

01:26:05.725 --> 01:26:07.945
but your father was weak.

01:26:07.988 --> 01:26:10.904
He was not like the rest
of us, he wanted out.

01:26:10.948 --> 01:26:11.992
And as you very well know,

01:26:12.036 --> 01:26:13.733
as it was in the
case of Johnny,

01:26:13.777 --> 01:26:15.474
there is really no
way out of this.

01:26:15.518 --> 01:26:16.780
- Your people,

01:26:16.823 --> 01:26:17.998
they're the ones who
took him from me?

01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:19.435
- But then I took you in

01:26:19.478 --> 01:26:22.568
and raised you as
if you were my son.

01:26:22.612 --> 01:26:26.659
Made you someone the
organization was so proud of.

01:26:26.703 --> 01:26:29.967
But ultimately, you're
just your father's son.

01:26:30.010 --> 01:26:32.187
- You think I'm gonna
let you live with this?

01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:33.971
I will kill [grunts].

01:26:34.014 --> 01:26:35.059
- Oh, you're going to kill me,

01:26:35.102 --> 01:26:36.016
I don't think you're
in a position

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:37.627
to do anything like that.

01:26:38.105 --> 01:26:39.411
You know, it'd be a lot
better if you just

01:26:39.455 --> 01:26:41.108
told me where the boy is.

01:26:41.152 --> 01:26:43.720
- You'll never find
him, you hear me?

01:26:43.763 --> 01:26:45.591
- There's a lot of places
I could still shoot you

01:26:45.635 --> 01:26:47.202
while I wait
for my answer.

01:26:48.028 --> 01:26:50.640
- You got your
answer, you coward!

01:26:51.293 --> 01:26:53.425
- Sorry it had to
end like this, son.

01:26:53.469 --> 01:26:55.688
- I'm not your son!

01:26:55.732 --> 01:26:57.168
- That you may be sincere

01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:59.953
and without offense 'til
the day of the Christ

01:26:59.997 --> 01:27:01.912
being filled with the
fruits of righteousness--

01:27:01.955 --> 01:27:02.956
- Go to hell, you damn--

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.176
[gun fires]

01:27:07.047 --> 01:27:10.964
- Say hello to your father
on your way to hell.

01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:14.968
[dramatic music]

01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:50.047
[mysterious music]

01:28:27.127 --> 01:28:30.740
[soft instrumental music]
