00:18.410 --> 00:19.555
Lana.

00:19.582 --> 00:22.112
I was hoping that you were up.

00:22.235 --> 00:23.893
Is everything alright?

00:26.276 --> 00:28.212
It's about Jason.

00:28.742 --> 00:31.499
I think I've made a horrible mistake.

00:32.791 --> 00:34.523
Jason.

00:35.911 --> 00:39.740
Lana, I'm not sure I'm the one you should
be talking to about this.

00:39.749 --> 00:43.608
Actually, I think that you're exactly
who I should be talking to.

00:44.820 --> 00:48.508
I've been thinking about it... the way we met,
the way he followed me here,

00:48.532 --> 00:51.485
the way he got a job at my school.

00:52.140 --> 00:55.956
I think that everything that Jason has
told me has been a lie.

00:57.932 --> 01:03.002
I'm starting to wonder if there's another
reason he came to Smallville besides me.

01:03.187 --> 01:05.986
- Like what?
- I don't know.

01:07.811 --> 01:10.841
But he's really starting to scare me.

01:11.595 --> 01:13.704
Don't worry, Lana.

01:14.593 --> 01:18.177
- I'd never let anything happen to you.
- I know.

01:19.306 --> 01:22.739
And it's made one thing very clear.

01:25.234 --> 01:28.634
I never should have given up on us.

01:29.137 --> 01:32.370
I can lie to myself as much as I want...

01:32.414 --> 01:35.819
but I've always been in love with you.

02:05.508 --> 02:07.344
I knew I couldn't trust you, Clark.

02:07.381 --> 02:09.211
Jason, No!

02:11.900 --> 02:14.204
Haven't you hurt her enough already?

02:22.006 --> 02:23.544
Jason!

02:35.936 --> 02:38.819
Clark can't protect you from me.

02:38.933 --> 02:40.572
Nobody can.

03:14.627 --> 03:15.803
Jason!

03:22.544 --> 03:24.881
Someone call an ambulance!

03:25.851 --> 03:28.889
Jason...
Jason, can you hear me?

Season 4 Episode 10

03:39.444 --> 03:41.944
Original Airdate Dec. 1, 2004

04:52.658 --> 04:55.731
Hey...
How's he doing?

04:57.104 --> 05:00.027
The doctors don't know.

05:00.107 --> 05:04.498
His heart's beating a mile-a-minute, and
they can't get his blood pressure down.

05:04.568 --> 05:08.106
That's a little odd for someone who's
unconscious, isn't it?

05:08.127 --> 05:11.172
They said he's in some sort of a "panic mode"...

05:11.175 --> 05:14.001
Like he's having a severe nightmare.

05:16.811 --> 05:18.651
What happened?

05:23.614 --> 05:27.768
He came by the Talon to
pick me up for lunch, and...

05:27.848 --> 05:30.725
I ran upstairs to grab a jacket.

05:30.726 --> 05:31.915
And?

05:33.830 --> 05:37.593
And I heard a crash...
that's it.

05:40.984 --> 05:47.376
He's been perfectly healthy. But the doctors
say if they can't get his heart rate down...

05:48.140 --> 05:50.950
that he could have a heart attack.

05:53.306 --> 05:56.396
They must have some idea what caused this.

05:56.461 --> 05:59.317
I wish I could help them.

05:59.345 --> 06:03.369
But he was just studying all morning before
he came to the apartment.

06:03.438 --> 06:06.782
The first time I saw him he was lying
on the Talon floor.

06:09.680 --> 06:13.104
Well let us know if there's anything we
can do to help, Ok?

06:16.257 --> 06:18.641
They need his insurance card.

06:18.733 --> 06:20.733
It's in my apartment.
Could you guys

06:20.745 --> 06:22.935
go get it for me? It for me?
I don't want to leave his side.

06:22.944 --> 06:24.644
- Yeah.
- Ok

06:42.882 --> 06:45.629
Clark, I don't mean to go "Dr. Phil"
on you, but don't you think

06:45.655 --> 06:48.355
you should admit
they're in a relationship?

06:49.579 --> 06:51.747
Come on Chloe, I'm past that.

06:51.842 --> 06:54.297
Yeah, I should have known
by that crippling stare

06:54.300 --> 06:56.800
on your face since you
walked into the apartment.

06:57.245 --> 07:00.530
I just could have used some more time to
ease into it, you know?

07:01.330 --> 07:05.705
Clark, you were in love with her.
That's not something you just "ease" out of.

07:05.729 --> 07:10.422
It's just by the time that I found out,
they were already this... serious thing.

07:10.522 --> 07:16.656
Yeah. But we all keep secrets for our own
reasons. I don't think I have to tell you that.

07:22.631 --> 07:24.383
I don't think going
through Jason's personal

07:24.409 --> 07:26.238
things falls under your
"snoop jurisdiction."

07:26.290 --> 07:28.347
I'll take my chances
with the jury on this one.

07:28.385 --> 07:32.236
I think maybe if we back-track through
Jason's last couple of days, it might help.

07:34.827 --> 07:38.884
Ooh. Jason had a meeting at LuthorCorp
this morning.

07:39.489 --> 07:41.437
Why didn't Lana say something?

07:41.607 --> 07:43.382
Maybe she didn't know.

07:51.476 --> 07:52.883
This place seems dead.

07:52.909 --> 07:56.363
Yeah. My dad used to work
overtime on Saturdays.

07:56.405 --> 07:58.125
This lot should be full by now.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.110
Where do you think everybody is?

08:03.189 --> 08:05.399
I don't know. But while
you're talking to Lex,

08:05.406 --> 08:07.451
I'm going to give myself
a "Backstage Tour."

08:25.095 --> 08:26.855
Clark.

08:27.555 --> 08:30.039
How the hell did you get in here?

08:30.091 --> 08:32.446
Yeah, the gate was open.

08:32.672 --> 08:34.664
Your security seems a little
"M.I.A." lately.

08:34.712 --> 08:36.767
That's obvious, but this
is a restricted area.

08:36.775 --> 08:38.375
This will only
take a second.

08:40.686 --> 08:43.345
I need someone to escort a guest out.

08:43.405 --> 08:45.161
Look Clark, I'm sorry
but I just got in from

08:45.175 --> 08:46.640
Metropolis, I've
got a lot to do.

08:46.885 --> 08:48.601
Just now.

08:48.968 --> 08:51.436
I thought you had a meeting with
Jason this morning.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.500
Not with me. He was meeting with the head
of my H.R. department.

08:54.853 --> 08:56.759
You giving him a job?

08:56.926 --> 09:01.512
Just some leads. I felt guilty for getting
Jason fired from the school.

09:02.210 --> 09:04.935
He didn't even want Lana to know about it,
I'm surprised he told you.

09:04.944 --> 09:06.444
He didn't.

09:07.209 --> 09:09.924
Jason's lying unconscious
at the hospital.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.096
Some sort of
neurological stress.

09:12.389 --> 09:14.185
Do they know what happened?

09:14.186 --> 09:15.299
No.

09:15.611 --> 09:19.328
But your H.R. guy might have been the last
person to talk to him.

09:19.329 --> 09:21.013
Look I'll track him
down but Clark,

09:21.039 --> 09:23.239
there could be a lot of reasons
for Jason's condition.

09:23.535 --> 09:25.535
There could also be a lot
of reasons why this place

09:25.542 --> 09:27.737
is deserted half-way
through Saturday's shift.

09:28.561 --> 09:32.253
I'll call in a specialist from Metropolis
to take a look at him.

09:32.576 --> 09:35.426
Assure Lana that I'm doing everything
I can for him.

11:10.415 --> 11:13.371
I've been waiting for you Chloe.

11:14.131 --> 11:17.509
- Mom?
- You can't escape this, Chloe.

11:17.533 --> 11:20.595
None of the women in our family
ever have.

12:14.884 --> 12:16.981
No! No!

12:20.268 --> 12:23.000
No, no!

13:05.098 --> 13:06.573
Standby.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.582
With all our safety
precautions,

13:09.608 --> 13:12.102
how the hell does
a lab explode?

13:12.622 --> 13:14.638
Well, when you're dealing
with meteor rocks,

13:14.640 --> 13:17.540
it's very difficult to predict how
our chemicals will react.

13:20.215 --> 13:22.700
Mr. Luthor, we're doing
everything we can.

13:22.726 --> 13:25.325
After the alarm sounded,
we sealed the room.

13:25.384 --> 13:27.839
All affected personnel
have been quarantined,

13:27.842 --> 13:30.051
and we're trying to fix
the damaged pipes.

13:31.052 --> 13:34.851
- You mean the bacteria's still leaking out?
- Only in that room.

13:38.329 --> 13:42.534
Once the situation is under control,
I want the project dismantled.

13:42.588 --> 13:45.003
But, Mr. Luthor...

13:45.099 --> 13:49.845
Your father negotiated this contract with
the military, we stand to make a lot

13:49.846 --> 13:51.870
if we can ever market the compound.

13:51.879 --> 13:56.857
And exactly what is the market for toxins that
evoke a person's worst nightmare

13:56.916 --> 13:58.355
before they fall unconscious, Dr. Ford?

13:58.367 --> 14:02.635
Think of the good. We could disable the
enemy without ever using violence,

14:02.671 --> 14:06.139
- We have statistics to prove...
- Statistics aren't lying in those beds!

14:06.231 --> 14:08.172
My employees are.

14:08.818 --> 14:11.738
And I'm afraid they're not the only ones.

14:11.805 --> 14:13.344
What do you mean?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.966
Someone who was visiting
the plant this morning

14:15.970 --> 14:18.336
is in the hospital with
the same symptoms.

14:18.954 --> 14:21.911
- Is he contagious?
- Oh no sir, no sir.

14:21.939 --> 14:24.061
The bacteria can't be
transmitted from

14:24.087 --> 14:26.387
one person to another, it has
to be inhaled directly.

14:26.401 --> 14:29.801
Then there's no reason to call the CDC
and panic the entire town.

14:30.261 --> 14:32.873
Now where are we with the antidote?

14:33.873 --> 14:39.193
This will clarify when it reaches 1000 degrees
Kelvin, and then we can test it.

14:39.226 --> 14:41.364
What's the E.T.A.?

14:45.684 --> 14:48.484
Another 5 hours.

14:53.113 --> 14:57.504
8 other people have just come down with the
condition that Jason and Chloe have.

14:57.911 --> 15:00.402
The doctor's haven't found anything in common?

15:00.416 --> 15:03.131
Didn't you say that Jason and Chloe were
both at LuthorCorp today?

15:03.221 --> 15:06.183
Yeah but half the victims in the hospital weren't.

15:06.386 --> 15:09.467
Whatever this is seems to strike completely
at random.

15:09.477 --> 15:11.551
There's no way to tell who's going to be next.

15:11.579 --> 15:14.508
Sounds contagious. In the air or the water?

15:14.580 --> 15:17.891
Then maybe it will show up in some
environmental quality report.

15:21.078 --> 15:23.690
- Lana.
- Come on in.

15:25.619 --> 15:28.841
I'm sorry to show up like this, I
just didn't know where else to go.

15:28.894 --> 15:31.896
Clark told us about Jason.
Has something happened?

15:32.397 --> 15:35.593
One of the other infected people just died.

15:35.804 --> 15:39.152
Lana, do the doctors have any idea at all
what's going on?

15:40.117 --> 15:43.127
Just that a person's body
can only sustain a level

15:43.137 --> 15:46.230
of panic for so long before
their heart gives out.

15:48.510 --> 15:52.588
I can't just sit in that
hospital any more, just...

15:52.614 --> 15:55.457
just watching Chloe
and Jason die.

16:00.066 --> 16:02.516
I want to help.

16:19.861 --> 16:22.706
I hope we didn't separate you from your flock.

16:24.111 --> 16:29.183
I understand your cynicism, Warden Stone,
but I assure you I truly am a changed man.

16:29.817 --> 16:32.159
Oh. Or just a smart one.

16:32.696 --> 16:36.986
You know, ever since you proclaimed this sudden
conversion to our resident "St. Paul",

16:37.035 --> 16:39.187
there hasn't been a single attempt on your life.

16:39.247 --> 16:42.192
I want only to be of help to others.

16:42.246 --> 16:48.430
What is the value of my sinful life, unless I use
it as an example to shepherd fellow sinners?

16:48.513 --> 16:53.075
To lead the away from the allure of hedonism,
and mistrust and greed.

16:53.154 --> 16:55.642
To follow a better way.

16:55.959 --> 16:57.326
Uh-huh.

16:57.488 --> 17:00.540
Well I'm afraid you're going to have to
change congregations.

17:00.591 --> 17:01.662
What do you mean?

17:01.737 --> 17:03.905
The appellate court overturned your conviction.

17:03.972 --> 17:06.119
Overturned?

17:06.124 --> 17:08.877
My appeal doesn't come up for months.
It's not possible.

17:08.919 --> 17:12.330
You'd be surprised what's possible
in this judicial system.

17:14.816 --> 17:20.210
I've done everything to work the system.
I hired the best lawyers in the world, I tried

17:20.259 --> 17:23.877
to pay off everyone from the bailiff to the
President of the United States,

17:23.921 --> 17:29.299
and I was told, categorically, I was never
going to see life outside these walls again.

17:29.365 --> 17:31.862
You do not want to be telling me things
of this nature.

17:31.934 --> 17:34.963
Yes, I do.
I'm guilty.

17:35.026 --> 17:38.125
Not of the crime I've been imprisoned for, but...

17:40.316 --> 17:44.881
so many other crimes, which should
have landed me in here years ago.

17:46.657 --> 17:48.559
This is where I belong.

17:48.642 --> 17:51.417
It's where I can do the most good.

17:55.715 --> 17:58.269
You... you want to stay in prison?

17:59.095 --> 18:03.071
Yes...
I do. I've found my...

18:06.922 --> 18:09.668
my mission in life.

18:09.946 --> 18:13.209
Contrary to your deluded point-of-view,

18:13.415 --> 18:18.402
this is not the Ritz Carlton, where you can
check in and check out at your leisure.

18:20.990 --> 18:24.931
Somebody did you a favor by getting you
out of this place. I'd say be grateful.

18:25.003 --> 18:27.646
But who? Who could do that?

18:28.266 --> 18:31.881
Obviously someone more powerful than you.

18:33.735 --> 18:37.818
As soon as this paperwork is finished...
you're a free man.

18:47.341 --> 18:50.364
We know that Jason was in town by 9 o'clock.

18:50.421 --> 18:53.226
According to the hourly satellite images,
we had clear skies all morning.

18:53.251 --> 18:55.757
Hourly? Can we get it a bit more
specific than that?

18:55.785 --> 18:57.344
I'll try.

18:57.589 --> 19:02.492
I just don't understand why Jason wouldn't
tell me that he had a meeting at Luthorcorp.

19:02.679 --> 19:06.417
It might have been a blow to his pride.
Accepting Lex's offer.

19:07.276 --> 19:10.638
Well maybe that's what all of this
has been about.

19:11.817 --> 19:15.550
I've been getting this feeling lately that
there's something he hasn't been telling me.

19:15.615 --> 19:18.570
Maybe he thought you'd see him differently
if you found out.

19:19.009 --> 19:22.274
Do you really think that I'm
that shallow, Clark?

19:23.404 --> 19:26.877
It might take him a while to get
to know you as well as I do.

19:32.731 --> 19:34.434
Look at that.

19:34.860 --> 19:37.107
It's like that cloud came out of nowhere.

19:37.203 --> 19:39.848
And then it's completely gone 5 minutes later.

19:39.904 --> 19:42.274
It covered 2 miles before it dissipated.

19:42.369 --> 19:45.130
- Why would a cloud just appear like that?
- Maybe it's not a cloud.

19:45.141 --> 19:49.434
- Maybe it's pollution or smoke or something.
- If that's the county line, Chloe's house is

19:49.486 --> 19:53.135
- right in the middle of it.
- So is LuthorCorp.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.948
Mom?

20:53.763 --> 20:55.800
Dad?

21:15.456 --> 21:17.853
Jason!

21:31.950 --> 21:34.179
Lana...

21:34.909 --> 21:37.068
Lana.

21:55.541 --> 21:57.935
They're all going to leave you.

21:57.962 --> 22:01.347
And there's nothing you can do about it.

22:05.694 --> 22:07.799
Lana!

22:15.952 --> 22:18.920
- I need you to hold him, get over here!
- Yes, sir.

22:39.216 --> 22:45.630
Mr. Luthor, we have never tested this antidote,
I urge you to try it on a lab animal first.

22:45.754 --> 22:50.770
One of my employees is about to die. Do you
see any other options for us right now?

22:50.832 --> 22:55.485
No sir, I don't. But please remember,
this is like a flu inoculation,

22:55.492 --> 22:58.712
it contains traces of the infectious element.

22:59.022 --> 23:02.877
Is that your way of telling me the patient's
going to get worse before he gets better?

23:03.545 --> 23:05.804
Assuming it works.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.581
Mr. Luthor, you can't go in there!

23:15.590 --> 23:18.171
You must keep exposure to the toxin
to a minimum!

23:18.196 --> 23:22.779
I'm responsible for this plant and everyone
who works here... I'm going with you.

24:32.422 --> 24:35.211
I understand you're treating a patient
named Jason Teague?

24:35.238 --> 24:38.928
Lex, I've got my hands full right now. We're
watching Mr. Teague,

24:38.936 --> 24:40.682
along with all the others in his condition.

24:40.756 --> 24:44.618
The others? Are you telling me all these
people have the same symptoms?

24:44.711 --> 24:48.626
Unfortunately.
We have no idea what we're dealing with.

24:51.134 --> 24:53.576
It's a synthetic toxin.

24:55.311 --> 24:58.011
A pressure tank exploded this morning
at my plant.

24:58.127 --> 25:02.327
We thought we had it contained but the toxin
release must have escaped into the atmosphere.

25:02.874 --> 25:05.529
It's possible all these people were exposed
at the time.

25:05.556 --> 25:10.206
And you're just telling me this now?
I have to call the center for disease control.

25:10.215 --> 25:12.140
I don't know how much they
can do, but there's an

25:12.147 --> 25:14.572
an antidote my project manager's
been modifying as we speak.

25:14.607 --> 25:15.935
How close is it?

25:15.955 --> 25:19.349
The first trial was unsuccessful, but I assure you
we will have the situation under control.

25:19.374 --> 25:20.784
It's too late for that.

25:21.256 --> 25:24.256
I need a doctor.
I need a doctor!

25:30.544 --> 25:33.050
Did you know about this when I talked
to you earlier today?

25:33.132 --> 25:37.712
Clark, other than Jason, I had no idea anyone
outside of LuthorCorp was exposed,

25:37.773 --> 25:39.538
you have to believe me.

25:41.592 --> 25:43.646
What is this, though?

26:37.662 --> 26:39.861
It all makes sense.

26:42.879 --> 26:45.912
Lana.
Help me.

26:45.964 --> 26:48.441
The meteor shower.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.948
You came the same day.

26:51.381 --> 26:54.061
How could I be so stupid?

26:54.413 --> 26:57.631
The meteor shower is the reason I'm here.

26:58.266 --> 27:01.715
I'm from a planet called Krypton.

27:04.251 --> 27:06.877
Lana, I wanted to tell you.

27:06.883 --> 27:09.962
But I didn't think you'd accept me.

27:16.646 --> 27:19.244
You're not even human?

27:21.331 --> 27:25.411
No, please.
That stuff makes me sick!

27:27.063 --> 27:30.704
My parents are gone because of you.

27:30.960 --> 27:33.793
I'm never going to see them again.

27:36.915 --> 27:40.206
You killed my parents.

27:56.365 --> 27:57.851
Mom.

28:02.695 --> 28:03.899
Clark?

28:03.910 --> 28:07.351
- I need to find my parents, where are they?
- They haven't been admitted.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.362
Clark you're the first patient to come out of
this, I think you'd better sit down.

28:10.387 --> 28:12.205
- No, I feel fine.
- Clark...

28:24.424 --> 28:26.283
Dad?

28:34.308 --> 28:36.029
Mom!

28:38.030 --> 28:39.573
Mom?

28:48.148 --> 28:49.396
Lex!

28:49.472 --> 28:50.870
I'll keep you updated.

28:50.878 --> 28:52.658
- You're running out of time.
- How did you get past security?

28:52.683 --> 28:56.846
It's Ok.. I don't understand, I left you
in the hospital, what happened?

28:56.851 --> 28:59.104
My parents are in there now.

28:59.126 --> 29:00.176
Clark-

29:00.177 --> 29:02.470
Lana, Chloe, Jason, they're all going to
die if you don't do something!

29:02.495 --> 29:05.147
What do you suggest I do?

29:10.847 --> 29:12.256
Use me.

29:13.841 --> 29:16.323
I want you to use me.

29:16.624 --> 29:20.536
Look, I came out of this panic state.
Maybe there's something in me that can help.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.746
I'll give you whatever samples you need.

29:22.834 --> 29:26.020
Look, even if your immune system could offer
us some sort of insight, those kind of

29:26.045 --> 29:29.643
tests take months, years to analyze!
No, no...

29:32.888 --> 29:37.848
He's right, Clark. We have a new antidote
that we can test in a few hours.

29:37.918 --> 29:39.116
There's no time.

29:39.118 --> 29:43.042
The antidote needs to be heated to 1000 degrees
Kelvin until it clears, otherwise it's useless!

29:43.114 --> 29:45.329
This time we're going to test it first.

29:45.349 --> 29:48.414
People's lives are at stake. We're
running out of time.

29:48.434 --> 29:51.010
Look at them, Mr. Luthor. You look at them.

29:51.016 --> 29:55.829
Are you going to point the finger and decide which
one of them is going to take the lethal injection?

29:55.920 --> 29:58.668
Whoever it is, you could be killing them.

30:48.123 --> 30:50.175
Mr. Luthor, No!

31:55.148 --> 31:57.003
- Clark?
- Thank God it worked.

31:57.024 --> 31:59.124
I'm going to get the
antidote to the hospital.

31:59.140 --> 32:00.749
Lex, you're going to be Ok.

32:45.049 --> 32:46.996
I should have known.

33:01.522 --> 33:03.231
Clark.

33:04.745 --> 33:06.648
Is there something bothering you son?

33:06.663 --> 33:10.041
No, it'll just take a few days before I can
walk into that room, and...

33:11.756 --> 33:15.855
not get a flash of the two of you
unconscious on the floor.

33:16.619 --> 33:19.118
Thanks for cleaning everything up.

33:19.725 --> 33:23.773
Somebody really did a number on that lamp
back there.

33:23.786 --> 33:25.657
Must have been some nightmare you had.

33:25.664 --> 33:29.076
And we woke up to find that it
almost came true.

33:29.079 --> 33:32.455
Clark you walked right into Lex's office
and almost gave up your secret.

33:32.581 --> 33:34.752
Who knows what they would have done to you?

33:34.759 --> 33:37.029
I didn't see any other choice.

33:37.125 --> 33:40.544
It's funny, because lately I've been thinking
I've gotten closer to

33:40.613 --> 33:43.305
being able to tell someone the truth about
me, but...

33:46.589 --> 33:49.931
now I'm convinced more than ever that
I can't tell anyone.

33:51.162 --> 33:53.533
Especially not Lana.

33:54.513 --> 33:58.587
I know how much it would mean to you
to be able to share your secret with her.

33:58.627 --> 34:01.001
As far apart as we've grown...

34:02.561 --> 34:04.844
I think about it every day.

34:07.479 --> 34:11.300
I hope our own fears haven't gotten in your way.

34:11.849 --> 34:16.550
I would hate for you to look back, and
regret not telling the people closest to you.

34:17.708 --> 34:21.561
I mean, there is a chance
Lana would understand.

34:24.231 --> 34:26.234
There is.

34:26.235 --> 34:28.389
But what if she didn't?

34:31.429 --> 34:35.179
Clark, look. I'm not...
sure that it's Lana...

34:36.534 --> 34:38.716
But I am sure that...

34:39.998 --> 34:43.531
someday there will be someone you can tell.

34:54.344 --> 34:57.209
Egg-Foo-Yung to the rescue!

35:03.584 --> 35:08.590
So, if I'd waited around the Peking Duck,
you'd have, what...

35:09.126 --> 35:10.654
been gone?

35:12.848 --> 35:16.720
No I would have been here.
Trying to figure out what to say.

35:19.593 --> 35:21.697
I don't understand.

35:23.003 --> 35:25.306
Is this because of your mom?

35:26.017 --> 35:28.342
You've been different ever since I met her.

35:28.352 --> 35:31.133
No I've been different every since I
came to Smallville.

35:31.711 --> 35:34.974
6 months ago, I never would have gone to
someone like Lex,

35:35.071 --> 35:37.752
and groveled for a job that I don't even want.

35:40.893 --> 35:45.576
Worst part is, I was too embarrassed
to even tell you about it.

35:46.046 --> 35:48.735
Since when have you ever been embarrassed
around me?

35:48.753 --> 35:50.436
Exactly.

35:52.234 --> 35:55.630
I don't like this person that I'm becoming, Lana.

35:56.135 --> 36:01.421
And I don't want to wait around for you to
resent me as much as I resent myself, so...

36:05.225 --> 36:07.304
That's not why you're leaving.

36:09.116 --> 36:11.621
The one thing I learned
from my relationship with Clark

36:11.635 --> 36:14.235
is when someone isn't
being honest with me.

36:22.383 --> 36:25.676
Jason.
Just tell me the truth.

36:48.557 --> 36:50.260
Be careful.

37:12.159 --> 37:15.941
I can't get a statement from LuthorCorp.
A huge chemical explosion causes everyone

37:15.955 --> 37:18.153
to relive their worst nightmares, what is that?!?

37:18.211 --> 37:20.661
And there's no sign of a
lawsuit, it's like

37:20.687 --> 37:23.936
this whole thing is being
completely forgotten about!

37:24.197 --> 37:25.844
What? What?

37:26.700 --> 37:28.489
WHAT!

37:29.558 --> 37:33.100
I've seen you worked up before, but this
is more than amped, even for you.

37:33.483 --> 37:36.609
I guess it's just displaced anxiety.

37:40.166 --> 37:42.485
I found my mom, Clark.

37:46.318 --> 37:48.178
Wow, that's...

37:48.192 --> 37:49.691
Chloe that's great!

37:49.700 --> 37:54.086
Yeah, I put my "feelers" out for years and
something 3 months ago finally came through, so...

37:54.489 --> 37:57.640
And it turns out she's...

37:57.880 --> 38:01.847
she's not exactly "M.I.A.",
so to speak.

38:06.432 --> 38:09.476
She's in a mental institution.

38:17.148 --> 38:18.985
I'm sorry.

38:19.266 --> 38:22.130
The real kicker is, it's hereditary.

38:22.134 --> 38:27.025
Listen, hey..
If there's one thing I've learned,

38:27.060 --> 38:31.322
it's that you're not destined to
follow in your parent's footsteps, alright?

38:31.336 --> 38:34.059
Ok Thanks.

38:35.974 --> 38:38.898
So, popular question of the day.

38:39.412 --> 38:42.486
What is Clark Kent's worst nightmare?

38:44.992 --> 38:47.339
When I woke up.

38:49.254 --> 38:52.537
Everyone that I knew was gone.

38:54.953 --> 38:57.598
I was completely alone.

38:57.605 --> 39:01.024
I wish I could say that I'll
always be there for you, but...

39:01.348 --> 39:05.570
somehow I get the feeling that may not
be a promise I can keep.

39:05.583 --> 39:09.083
You were the only one that came out
of it, Clark, and...

39:09.085 --> 39:11.599
I don't think it's because you've been
taking your vitamins.

39:11.600 --> 39:15.678
- Chloe.
- Look, you know what, you don't have to tell me.

39:16.275 --> 39:22.833
I know that I gave you my word that I was
going to stop all this prying, but...

39:24.600 --> 39:29.399
In these last few months I got a taste of
what it was like to keep my mom's secret...

39:29.424 --> 39:31.994
and I've never felt more alone.

39:34.845 --> 39:36.940
It's weird when people think
they're so close to you,

39:36.945 --> 39:38.995
but have no idea what you're
really going through.

39:39.023 --> 39:40.223
Yeah.

39:41.100 --> 39:44.092
I'd hate to live my whole life like this.

39:46.146 --> 39:52.801
But, after "fessing up" it's amazing how
quickly that feeling of loneliness disappears.

39:52.838 --> 39:57.048
I mean, if you can't tell your best friend,
who can you tell?

39:57.477 --> 40:00.002
Right, Clark?
