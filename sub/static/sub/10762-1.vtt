00:07.591 --> 00:12.062
I, Daphne Moon,
do take thee, Niles Crane,

00:12.054 --> 00:14.022
as my husband.

00:14.306 --> 00:18.231
I promise you my fidelity
and my support...

00:18.227 --> 00:21.527
My laughter and my tears...

00:21.522 --> 00:25.527
My constant friendship
and my unending love

00:25.526 --> 00:28.029
as long as we both shall live.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.997
I, Niles Crane, do take thee,

00:30.989 --> 00:33.333
Daphne Moon, as my wife.

00:33.325 --> 00:37.171
I vow to you my fidelity
and my support

00:37.162 --> 00:40.587
my honor and my respect.

00:40.582 --> 00:43.586
My honesty and my protection.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.589
You are my comfort, my joy,

00:47.089 --> 00:49.091
and my one true love.

00:49.091 --> 00:52.595
I will cherish you all the days
of my life

00:52.594 --> 00:55.097
and treasure the journey
that has brought us

00:55.097 --> 00:58.101
to this most wonderful,
perfect place.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.603
For most folks, that's
one too many free cocktails.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.105
(laughing):
Am I right?

01:05.065 --> 01:07.033
Seriously,
do you have the rings?

01:07.025 --> 01:09.448
Oh... no.
In our rush to get here,

01:09.444 --> 01:11.446
I completely forgot about them.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.914
Does this mean we can't get married?

01:13.198 --> 01:14.825
It would if we didn't offer

01:14.825 --> 01:19.331
seven different wedding band
packages for you to choose from.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.797
Now, depending on your budget,

01:20.789 --> 01:23.838
we can offer you anything
from the "Be Steel My Heart"--

01:23.834 --> 01:25.836
that's genuine stainless
right there--

01:25.836 --> 01:27.338
to the "Never-ending Love"

01:27.337 --> 01:30.181
which can be returned for up
to 90 days; no questions asked.

01:30.465 --> 01:33.469
They do seem
the nicest.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.470
(cell phone rings)

01:35.470 --> 01:38.440
Oh, damn, who could be calling
at this hour?

01:38.724 --> 01:40.852
Wow, you certainly don't see

01:40.851 --> 01:43.195
six-and-a-half karat gold
every day.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.859
Daphne, it's Roz.
Hello?

01:45.105 --> 01:47.608
Quick, turn on your TV.
My building's on the news. What?

01:47.608 --> 01:48.951
Some murder-suicide thing.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.740
I'm going to wave to you
from my balcony.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.454
Darn, I'm not home.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.115
Where are you?
You're not going to believe this,

01:54.448 --> 01:57.998
w. hut Niles and I flew to Reno and
we're getting married right now

01:58.327 --> 01:59.249
You are not!

01:59.620 --> 02:00.496
I am so.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.339
(high-pitched screams)

02:03.332 --> 02:06.632
Apparently, it's some
sort of dolphin emergency

02:06.627 --> 02:08.003
I should go.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.505
I'll tell you everything
when we get back.

02:09.503 --> 02:10.425
Okay, bye.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.175
(sighs)
Ooh.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.556
Sorry

02:15.552 --> 02:18.055
You may exchange rings
as a symbol

02:18.055 --> 02:20.558
of the promises
you've made here today.

02:26.188 --> 02:28.190
(soft laughter)

02:28.690 --> 02:30.658
By the power
vested in me

02:30.651 --> 02:33.530
by the State of Nevada,
County of Washoe,

02:33.528 --> 02:37.032
and the all-new Lucky Seven
Resort and Casino,

02:37.032 --> 02:38.955
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.704
Good luck.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.673
(piped-in bells ringing)

02:44.956 --> 02:48.051
Hey, don't forget to check out
our topless buffet.

02:51.088 --> 02:54.592
He never said,
"You may kiss the bride."

02:54.591 --> 02:56.593
You may kiss the bride

03:07.354 --> 03:08.981
(keys jangling)

03:08.980 --> 03:09.981
Chop, chop, Dad.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.449
Let's get a move on.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.489
Last time I was late
for the Farmer's Market,

03:13.485 --> 03:16.329
I got the worst
of the squash blossoms.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.115
Oh, whatever shall we serve
the duchess?

03:18.615 --> 03:19.457
What?

03:19.616 --> 03:20.708
I said, "I'm coming."

03:21.118 --> 03:22.620
And it's not my fault I'm late,
it's Daphne's.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.620
S.
l don't know where she is.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.122
I had to make my own lunch.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.716
Oh, dear Lord.
Give it here.

03:32.462 --> 03:36.467
Two bags of chips,
three puddin' cups,

03:36.466 --> 03:38.343
and a root beer.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.640
H it?
What's wrong with it?

03:39.970 --> 03:40.516
A: this is not a lunch,

03:41.012 --> 03:43.014
and B: I fail to see
how it took you so long

03:43.014 --> 03:44.516
since you did not
make anything

03:45.016 --> 03:47.360
but simply transferred smaller
containers into a larger one.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.486
Let's go.

03:50.147 --> 03:51.239
Oh, uh...
Oh!

03:51.231 --> 03:52.153
Hello, all. Hi.
Hello, all.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.150
Where have you been?

03:53.150 --> 03:54.151
I had to make my own lunch

03:54.151 --> 03:55.152
Oh...

03:55.527 --> 03:57.529
We've got some big news.

03:57.529 --> 03:58.530
Yes, um...

03:59.030 --> 04:00.407
Maybe they should sit down.
Oh, yes.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.659
What's going on?

04:01.658 --> 04:02.534
DAPHNE : Well..

04:02.993 --> 04:04.040
Last night I told Niles

04:04.035 --> 04:06.538
that I wanted to
marry him right then and there

04:06.997 --> 04:08.419
NILES: And once I realized she
was serious,

04:08.665 --> 04:10.759
we rushed out into the night
fully intending to.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.253
But then we found
out that in Washington

04:12.252 --> 04:14.254
it takes three days to
get a marriage license.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.632
Thank goodness

04:17.007 --> 04:17.599
Why?

04:18.091 --> 04:18.841
"wHY"?

04:19.009 --> 04:20.601
If we had missed
your wedding,

04:20.594 --> 04:22.392
well, it would have
just killed me.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.639
It would have?

04:23.638 --> 04:26.141
Oh, of course
it would.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.608
Niles, we've been there

04:27.601 --> 04:30.605
through the last ten tortured
years of your courtship.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.528
How could we not be hurt
if we missed the wedding?

04:33.857 --> 04:35.905
But surely you could
understand if...

04:35.901 --> 04:40.532
If someone were carried away
by their emotions.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.033
Because it would have just
broken my heart.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.419
We came here to tell you

04:53.418 --> 04:56.763
that there's a wedding
in three days!

04:56.755 --> 04:57.631
Oh, well...

04:57.631 --> 04:59.133
Isn't that big news?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.008
Yes.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.430
We're going to have a...

05:01.426 --> 05:03.428
A simple ceremony
at the courthouse.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.930
That is just wonderful.

05:04.930 --> 05:05.931
And you know what?

05:05.931 --> 05:07.433
By way of a celebration,

05:07.432 --> 05:09.901
please allow me
to treat us all to dinner

05:09.893 --> 05:11.816
at Coeur du Singe.
How does that sound, huh?

05:11.812 --> 05:12.813
That sounds wonderful.

05:12.813 --> 05:13.814
(doorbell rings)

05:13.814 --> 05:14.815
Hey, Martin.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.316
Hey, how are
you doing?

05:16.316 --> 05:17.818
Want to go
to the dog park?

05:17.818 --> 05:19.195
Oh, my God,
you guys are here.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.163
(joyous yells)

05:22.572 --> 05:25.451
Well, I'm here, too.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.293
Um, we were just talking
about our wedding.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.162
Oh, good, I want to hear
all about it.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.456
We're going to have a small
civil ceremony on Friday

05:31.915 --> 05:34.338
(yells)
Huh?

05:34.334 --> 05:36.211
Yes, if you'll excuse me,

05:36.211 --> 05:39.215
I'm in a rush to get
to the Farmer's Market.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.215
NILES: At this hour?

05:40.590 --> 05:43.434
I hope you like
listless radicchio.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.685
Okay, what the hell?

05:44.678 --> 05:46.976
I thought you guys
got married in Reno.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.815
We did, but
as we were trying

05:48.807 --> 05:51.310
to tell Mr. Crane
and Dr. Crane,

05:51.309 --> 05:53.607
they told us how hurt they'd be
if we got married without them.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.814
NILES: Yes, yes, which in the
moment, failed to occur to us.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.608
So, to spare their feelings,

05:57.607 --> 06:00.577
we're having a fake wedding
on Friday.

06:00.569 --> 06:01.946
Well, that works for me

06:01.945 --> 06:04.448
because Alice is still
counting on being a flower girl.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.449
Of course.
Great.

06:06.867 --> 06:07.959
So, if you guys
have two weddings,

06:07.951 --> 06:09.373
when's your anniversary
going to be?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.747
Well, I suppose
to keep up appearances,

06:11.746 --> 06:14.249
it'll have to be
the second one, won't it?

06:14.249 --> 06:16.251
Well, could celebrate
two anniversaries.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.253
A public on; and then a

06:18.253 --> 06:22.258
second, secret
one just for us.

06:22.257 --> 06:25.261
Ooh, I like that.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.262
Sort of sexy
having an anniversary

06:27.262 --> 06:29.139
only the two of us
know about.

06:29.472 --> 06:32.021
Three of us.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.024
I still can't believe
we're married.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.897
It's our
one-day anniversary.

06:36.897 --> 06:40.743
And we're the only ones
who know.

06:41.151 --> 06:44.746
You know,
we should celebrate.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.740
L-[ow about going
to the dog park?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.742
That doesn't sound
very romantic.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.244
I'm not talking to you.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.673
NILES:
Nervous?

06:59.669 --> 07:01.171
DAPHNE:
Less than last time.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.173
Al. I guess it helps to
have had a rehearsal

07:03.173 --> 07:05.141
That wasn't a rehearsal;
it was the real thing.

07:05.508 --> 07:08.557
This is just
a touring company performance.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.055
Right.

07:12.057 --> 07:14.560
It's a bloody miracle
we're here in one piece

07:15.060 --> 07:16.562
what with the way you drive.

07:16.561 --> 07:20.065
I'm better at it when someone's
not screaming in my ear.

07:20.065 --> 07:23.069
Well, in my day, people
didn't drive so recklessly.

07:23.068 --> 07:24.445
Do you know why?

07:24.444 --> 07:27.948
Is it because
you rode dinosaurs?

07:30.200 --> 07:32.077
You should talk
to your daughter.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.961
When we get home,
you're getting ice cream.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.591
Why did we all
have to

07:42.587 --> 07:44.089
just to pick up
a bloody license?

07:44.089 --> 07:45.557
Couldn't we have met
at the church?

07:45.548 --> 07:46.970
Mum, we aren't going
to the church.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.219
We're getting married here.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.970
You're what?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.847
We're having
a civil ceremony

07:51.846 --> 07:53.223
Without a minister?

07:53.223 --> 07:54.600
Out of the question.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.976
Mum...
That's enough, Daphne.

07:55.976 --> 07:59.856
I am your mother and I will not
bear witness to a godless union.

07:59.854 --> 08:02.733
Gertrude, I favor a
church wedding, too.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.734
But this is their day,
not ours.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.112
Maybe we should just let them
decide how it's going to be.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.615
If people gut to decide things
for themselves,

08:10.115 --> 08:12.083
no one would go to church.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.577
If I may...

08:13.576 --> 08:16.329
I'll handle this,
Your Honor.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.501
Mrs. Moon...

08:17.497 --> 08:20.000
You have my personal guarantee

08:20.000 --> 08:23.345
that this will not be a
godless union.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.510
For if you
truly believe

08:26.506 --> 08:32.013
in the omniscience
and omnipresence of the Lord,

08:32.011 --> 08:36.813
then surely are we not always
in His presence?

08:36.808 --> 08:39.061
No, He lives at the church.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.023
All I'm asking is

08:43.440 --> 08:45.943
that you honor the wishes
of an old woman

08:45.942 --> 08:49.037
whose every child has been
married by a minister--

08:49.029 --> 08:51.407
or at least a prison chaplain.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.784
Perhaps given the depth
of feeling here,

08:53.783 --> 08:55.285
it would be best to wait.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.287
Well, I suppose we
could find a church

08:57.287 --> 08:58.789
in reasonably
short order.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.085
I don't believe this.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.833
Well, if you're
not going to get married now,

09:01.833 --> 09:03.835
perhaps you could all
take this into the hall.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.212
I have a schedule to keep.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.713
Roz, take me home.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.840
We'll call you when
we've cleared this up.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.183
Ice.
Okay. Let's go, Al

09:10.675 --> 09:11.551
Congratulations.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.683
When you're ready to have
a proper wedding,

09:17.682 --> 09:19.434
you know where to find me.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.069
That we do.

09:21.352 --> 09:24.947
On your fiery throne
presiding over the damned!

09:25.315 --> 09:26.362
All right,
let's-let's go.

09:26.858 --> 09:28.360
Where are we going
to find a clergyman

09:28.860 --> 09:30.112
who will perform
on such short notice?

09:30.361 --> 09:31.863
Hey, maybe the judge
knows somebody.

09:31.863 --> 09:32.864
Hang on a second, you guys

09:33.364 --> 09:33.865
Your Honor

09:34.365 --> 09:35.491
I'm sorry, Daphne,

09:35.492 --> 09:37.369
but it'll just be few days
and then we can be married.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.745
We already are.

09:38.745 --> 09:42.249
This is supposed to be the
happiest time of my life

09:42.248 --> 09:44.216
I want to wear
my wedding ring.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.256
I'm Mrs. Niles Crane,

09:45.752 --> 09:48.005
and I don't want
to keep it a secret.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.847
You just want to tell them
the truth?

09:49.839 --> 09:51.341
Too complicated.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.638
Let's just
get married again.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.011
The wedding's on.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.012
What? What about Mrs. Moon?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.889
I'm sorry she'll miss it,
but that's her choice.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.357
Your Honor, we've
changed our minds.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.646
We want to be married.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.519
Oh, all right, but we have to be
quick about this.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.520
Are we ready to begin?

10:03.520 --> 10:04.737
Yes.
Yes.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.276
JUDGE: Okay, let's do it.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.024
Daphne, please repeat after me.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.118
Actually, we've written
our own vows.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.407
Of course you have.

10:11.611 --> 10:17.664
I, Daphne Moon, do take thee,
Niles Crane, as my husband.

10:17.659 --> 10:21.630
I promise you my fidelity
and my support...

10:21.621 --> 10:22.998
My laughter and my tears...

10:22.997 --> 10:25.876
You said you wouldn't
do this.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.378
...my constant friendship...
I say a Int of things.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.801
(chuckling)

10:35.301 --> 10:37.303
Oh, Frasier, thank you
so much for dinner.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.680
Yes, it was wonderful.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.648
It was my pleasure.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.645
Dad, don't you have
something to add?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.646
Well, I already said thank you
for dinner.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.648
What am I supposed to do,
get down on my knees

10:48.648 --> 10:52.573
and kowtow to your fancy-ass
American Express card?

10:52.569 --> 10:54.571
No...

10:54.571 --> 10:57.916
I was referring to the gift
we have for them.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.159
Oh, right!

10:59.159 --> 11:00.160
I forgot about that.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.458
Yeah, and thanks
for dinner, Frasier.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.296
It really was excellent.

11:04.289 --> 11:07.168
And I didn't think I'd
like beef cheeks...

11:07.167 --> 11:09.420
Yes, yes, Dad,
give them the gift. I...

11:09.794 --> 11:12.843
This is so exciting-
our first wedding present.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.846
Oh, it's a silver
picture frame.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.347
Beautiful.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.347
And,nota hene,

11:21.347 --> 11:24.351
it's been engraved
with today's date.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.352
In order to commemorate
your wedding day

11:26.352 --> 11:28.354
until your real gift
arrives.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.355
Oh, it's very sweet.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.323
Thank you Mr. Crane
and Dr. Crane.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.195
Well, you can't call us that anymore.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.117
We're family now.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.488
So we are.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.992
Well, thank you... Frasier.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.494
(laughing)

11:42.493 --> 11:43.995
Oh, that feels strange.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.872
And thank you...

11:45.872 --> 11:47.465
Martin.
Dad?

11:47.457 --> 11:48.629
Dad.

11:48.625 --> 11:49.501
Or Martin.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.877
Whatever makes
you comfortable.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.221
Oh, thank you, Mr. Crane.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.090
Don't mention it.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.592
Well, I'd better go and figure out

11:57.592 --> 11:59.594
what to pack
for the honeymoon.

12:02.597 --> 12:06.602
I'm just bringing sunscreen.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.738
Pardon me.

12:10.730 --> 12:15.031
I have to go poke out
my mind's eye.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.871
Ah, you're lucky.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.991
I always wanted to go
to Bora Bora.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.788
Oh, it's going
to be fantastic, Dad.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.537
We're staying in a thatched hut
built out over the water.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.413
In the middle of the floor,
there's a window

12:27.413 --> 12:29.757
where you can look straight down
to the bottom of the ocean.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.046
Oh, well, I hope it's not ton deep.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.044
When we went to the top
of the Space Needle

12:33.044 --> 12:34.887
and you looked down,
you got sick.

12:35.630 --> 12:36.552
Dad...

12:37.048 --> 12:39.551
All over that poor
Japanese tour group.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.261
Dad.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.558
(doorbell

12:47.558 --> 12:50.562
That was three years ago.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.064
Mrs. Moon.

12:53.064 --> 12:54.566
Did you find
a minister yet?

12:54.565 --> 12:56.067
No.
I'm sorry,

12:56.067 --> 12:56.943
Actually..

12:56.943 --> 12:58.195
Good, then I'm not too late.

12:58.194 --> 13:02.700
Too late for what?

13:02.699 --> 13:10.083
When I got home
this afternoon...

13:10.081 --> 13:12.334
And I began thinking:

13:12.333 --> 13:15.212
I was married by a minister
in a church,

13:15.211 --> 13:16.713
and what's it got me?

13:17.171 --> 13:18.718
Alone and unloved is what.

13:18.715 --> 13:22.219
And likely because I've been such
a rotten mother

13:22.218 --> 13:23.720
to you all these years.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.597
You haven't been rotten.

13:25.596 --> 13:26.973
Oh, yes, I have.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.101
On what should've been the happiest
day of your life,

13:29.600 --> 13:31.602
I thought of only myself.

13:31.602 --> 13:36.608
I'm ashamed, I'm, I mean,
I'm embarrassed.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.484
And I apologize.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.452
Oh, Mum.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.243
Oh.
(frying)

13:42.238 --> 13:46.994
Oh, my only solace is
you aren't married yet.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.329
Because if I missed

13:49.329 --> 13:51.127
my baby's wedding,

13:51.122 --> 13:53.625
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.627
Daphne...

13:56.502 --> 14:01.508
Niles...

14:02.008 --> 14:05.012
You get married
any way you want to.

14:05.011 --> 14:08.766
All that matters is that
I'm thereto share it with you

14:08.765 --> 14:10.517
Of course you'll be there.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.019
(Crying)

14:17.023 --> 14:18.024
We'll go right back

14:18.524 --> 14:20.026
to that courthouse tomorrow

14:20.026 --> 14:22.028
and resume where
we left off.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.905
Oh, nothing could make me
happier.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.873
Ah, Mrs. Moon.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.788
I see you've made peace
with the wedding.

14:28.159 --> 14:29.661
Yes, Mrs. Moon
has rescinded her ultimatum

14:30.161 --> 14:33.540
so we're having
the wedding tomorrow.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.007
Ah.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.001
Niles, may I have a word
with you?

14:37.001 --> 14:38.378
NILES:Mm-hmm.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.675
Excuse me.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.015
What the hell is going on?

14:43.007 --> 14:44.008
You guys already
got married.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.011
Yes, but she doesn't
know that, so tomorrow

14:46.010 --> 14:48.513
we're going to have another
ceremony for her benefit.

14:49.013 --> 14:49.889
That's crazy.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.183
It may be, but I'm afraid
the truth would crush her.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.685
Oh, please

14:53.684 --> 14:56.062
All the winepresses in Bordeaux
wouldn't crush that woman.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.658
Niles, what you and Daphne
shared today was utterly unique.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.073
You think so?

15:03.069 --> 15:04.571
Yes, it was a singular moment.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.572
Anyone fooled
by a repeat performance

15:06.572 --> 15:08.415
would have to be
a complete imbecile.

15:09.700 --> 15:13.204
True.

15:13.204 --> 15:16.083
But if it's what Daphne wants,
I'll support her.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.210
We'll get Roz back,
we'll find a different judge,

15:18.543 --> 15:20.591
and we'll just do it
all over again.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.931
And... it'll be just as perfect
as today's was.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.220
Fine.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.218
But I'm not singing
"Wonderful World" again.

15:27.218 --> 15:29.596
(gasping):
Maybe more perfect.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.434
Remember how
excited we were

15:34.434 --> 15:36.937
at our first wedding?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.439
Yeah, we were both shaking.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.861
Yeah.

15:41.232 --> 15:43.234
Hey, I noticed
the first time,

15:43.234 --> 15:46.238
you promised me your honesty
and protection,

15:46.737 --> 15:48.239
but not the second time.

15:48.573 --> 15:51.622
No, because I vowed
to, uh, always be true

15:51.617 --> 15:54.621
and to be your
constant champion.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.122
It's the same thing.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.123
I suppose.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.001
You liked it better the first way?

16:00.001 --> 16:02.379
Okay, we can go back to that.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.881
Thanks.

16:04.881 --> 16:07.384
You making
any changes?

16:07.383 --> 16:09.852
Nope. Same old, same old.

16:10.261 --> 16:11.729
.. J'J'
N Dah, dah, dah, dah.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.598
Where's Alice?

16:13.973 --> 16:14.974
Oh, upset stomach.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.476
On the way home yesterday,

16:16.476 --> 16:18.524
she snacked on t he leftover
petals in her basket.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.021
Ble So, I'm sorry, but I won't be a

16:20.521 --> 16:21.272
to join you for dinner

16:21.606 --> 16:23.028
We understand.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.401
Explain it to me then.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.402
What sort of child eats roses?

16:26.402 --> 16:27.278
This isn't normal

16:27.778 --> 16:29.246
ROZ: You could've
stopped her, you know.

16:29.614 --> 16:32.163
Not the way she was gnashing
them up, I couldn't.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.661
Like a wood chipper, she was.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.661
All right.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.164
The incredible beaver baby.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.507
We get it.

16:39.790 --> 16:40.291
Oh, dear Lord

16:40.791 --> 16:41.792
ls that Donny?

16:41.792 --> 16:43.294
Everybody, look at your shoes.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.796
Wait a minute.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.797
Daph... is that Daphne?

16:46.797 --> 16:48.799
Hi.
Donny.

16:48.799 --> 16:49.800
What a surprise.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.801
L-Ii, everybody.

16:51.302 --> 16:52.804
Boy, I hope this isn't
uncomfortable.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.806
Oh, no, no,
not at all

16:54.805 --> 16:57.809
Uh, say, is that
a drinking fountain over there?

16:58.309 --> 16:59.652
Sure looks
like one.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.812
Well, Niles,

17:01.812 --> 17:04.315
Daphne, I'd like you to meet
Bridget, my fiance.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.862
Hi.
Hello.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.156
We just filed
for our marriage license.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.029
Congratulations.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.872
That's great.
Thank you.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.661
I know that
I was getting married

17:12.656 --> 17:14.125
last time you ran into me,

17:14.116 --> 17:15.992
but this time I found
the real thing.

17:15.992 --> 17:17.665
Good, I'm glad.
Yeah.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.664
You know,
if you hadn't left me,

17:19.664 --> 17:21.665
then I never would've met
my ex-wife

17:21.665 --> 17:23.167
who introduced me
to Bridget.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.670
So, in a weird way,
you played a big part

17:25.670 --> 17:26.546
in my eventual happiness.

17:27.003 --> 17:28.050
That's a very
healthy perspective.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.048
DONNY:
I think so, too.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.927
So, what are you guys
doing here?

17:31.926 --> 17:35.305
Niles and I
are getting married.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.056
Well, congratulations.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.308
That is great.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.274
(chuckling)

17:39.684 --> 17:41.277
Daphne.
Thank you.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.270
Yes, well,
it's great.

17:42.270 --> 17:43.772
And it's nice
seeing you.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.569
And I hope you come
to our wedding.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.317
Oh, same here.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.694
Really, you'd be okay
with that?

17:52.697 --> 17:54.199
Well, sure. Why not?

17:54.198 --> 17:56.200
Of course, it's anybody's guess

17:56.701 --> 17:59.079
how long we could be waiting here.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.831
You can come in now.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.584
Who had one second?

18:04.584 --> 18:06.052
Uh, everyone, it's time

18:06.043 --> 18:07.545
Oh, well, here we go, then.

18:08.045 --> 18:08.546
This is Bridget.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.047
Oh, lovely to meet you.

18:10.047 --> 18:10.923
Hi,
nice to meet you.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.345
Hi. Hi.

18:12.341 --> 18:13.342
Hi.
Hi.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.219
Hi, how you doing?

18:16.596 --> 18:18.598
Is this everybody?

18:18.598 --> 18:19.565
Yes.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.226
JUDGE: Let's get started.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.102
We come here today to unite

18:23.102 --> 18:25.480
this man and this woman
in marriage.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.448
I understand
Daphne and Niles

18:27.440 --> 18:28.362
have composed vows

18:28.608 --> 18:31.737
that are especially significant
to them. Niles.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.738
Yeah.
(clears throat)

18:33.738 --> 18:35.740
Uh, I, Niles Crane,

18:35.740 --> 18:40.246
take you, Daphne Moon,
to be my wife.

18:40.745 --> 18:45.251
I-I vow to you my-
my fidelity and support,

18:45.750 --> 18:49.254
honor, respect, uh, honesty...

18:49.253 --> 18:50.630
Protection

18:52.465 --> 18:55.719
...and support

18:55.968 --> 19:00.519
Uh... you are my comfort
and joy and, oh...

19:00.514 --> 19:03.984
Shoot, there's one more, uh..

19:04.393 --> 19:05.770
One true love.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.112
One true love.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.606
That's right,
that's right.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.904
Go.
Okay, you

19:10.900 --> 19:13.653
"Okay, you go"?

19:16.906 --> 19:20.501
I, Daphne:"Moon, do

19:20.493 --> 19:22.996
I'm sorry,
this is wrong.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.498
I can't stand here
and rattle off a bunch of words

19:25.998 --> 19:27.500
that don't mean anything
anymore.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.002
I'm can't go through
with this.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.002
DONNY:
Yes!

19:30.002 --> 19:31.504
I knew it!

19:31.504 --> 19:32.756
Now you know what it's like

19:32.922 --> 19:35.391
to have the love of your life
dump you at the altar.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.806
And good luck trying to find
somebody as good

19:37.802 --> 19:39.645
because she just
ain't out there.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.685
What?

19:45.685 --> 19:46.937
No, no

19:46.936 --> 19:48.688
No, Bridget!

19:48.688 --> 19:50.690
Bridget!
(door closes)

19:50.690 --> 19:54.194
I'm sorry, everyone,
but Niles and I,

19:54.193 --> 19:56.070
we're already married.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.446
What?

19:57.822 --> 19:58.823
Mrs. Moon, I'm afraid it's
true.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.700
Uh, Niles and Daphne
are already married,

20:00.700 --> 20:02.828
and they were simply trying
to spare your feelings.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.037
You knew about Reno?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.789
FRASIER: I was talking
about yesterday.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.211
What happened in Reno?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.959
They gut married
yesterday?

20:09.959 --> 20:11.552
This is all a lie?

20:11.544 --> 20:13.342
No, yesterday was a lie.
We eloped last week.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.304
I thought you had

20:14.588 --> 20:15.714
to wait for the license.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.967
That's why we went to Reno.

20:17.174 --> 20:17.970
Why didn't you tell us?

20:18.217 --> 20:19.059
We thought you'd be insulted.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.849
I'm insulted now!

20:20.845 --> 20:23.223
How could you tell Roz
and not your own family?!

20:23.222 --> 20:24.690
How could you have two weddings

20:24.682 --> 20:25.558
without telling your mother
about one?

20:25.558 --> 20:26.730
How could you
cheat Alice

20:26.726 --> 20:29.570
out of being
a flower girl?

20:29.562 --> 20:31.485
We just wanted
to be married.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.359
Hold on, I got a question here.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.861
You've been married
for a week...

20:37.361 --> 20:39.830
How come you're not
on your honeymoon?

20:41.240 --> 20:44.585
Thank you... Martin.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.082
I hope you can all forgive us.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.583
Of course.
Well, of course we can. Of course.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.085
Your happiness, that
's what's important.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.882
This is such a relief.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.258
It just felt wrong

20:55.254 --> 20:57.598
to start off
a marriage with a lie.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.385
Was the first one
at least in from of a minister?

21:00.885 --> 21:02.387
of course
Yes, let's go.

21:09.143 --> 21:11.145
 Hey, baby, I hear
the blues a-calling 

21:11.145 --> 21:13.989
 Tossed salads
and scrambled eggs 

21:13.981 --> 21:15.904
 on, my 

21:16.275 --> 21:18.277
 And maybe I seem
a bit confused 

21:18.277 --> 21:21.372
 Well, maybe,
but I got you pegged 

21:21.363 --> 21:22.865
(laughs)

21:22.865 --> 21:24.867
 But I don't know what to do

21:24.867 --> 21:28.667
 With those tossed salad
 and scrambled eggs 

21:28.662 --> 21:31.506
 They're calling again

21:31.999 --> 21:33.922
Good night!
