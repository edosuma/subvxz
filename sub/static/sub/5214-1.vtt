  UGH. PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTING.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.698

     THIS IS HOW YOU PUT ON
       A NEW PILLOW CASE.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.234
      THEN WHAT YOU DO IS
   THE DOUBLE-FOLD MANEUVER.

03:55.236 --> 03:56.835
    THIS IS ALSO REALLY NICE

03:56.837 --> 04:00.739
    TO DO IN YOUR OWN HOME,
      AND THEN LIKE THAT,
         FLUFF, FLUFF.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.507
        PERFECT P-CASE.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.543
      WHY ARE YOU CHANGING
       THE PILLOW CASES?

04:04.545 --> 04:06.745
     IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE.
   THEY'RE NOT CHECKING OUT.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.814
  OKAY, HOW ABOUT WE JUST TRY
       TO KEEP THIS JOB,

04:08.816 --> 04:10.449

             FINE.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.853
 WHAT DO I DO WITH THEIR SHIT?
     DO I HAVE TO FOLD IT?

04:14.855 --> 04:18.322
      OKAY, IF I RAPED YOU
  RIGHT NOW WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

04:18.325 --> 04:19.925
      I DON'T WANT TO PLAY
      THIS GAME RIGHT NOW.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.560
    YOU NEVER WANT TO PLAY.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.562
         YEAH, I KNOW,
  THAT'S WHY I'M NOT PLAYING.

04:23.564 --> 04:26.431
  THIS WAS A STUPID GAME WHEN
 WE WERE KIDS AND IT STILL IS.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.799
         HEY, REMEMBER
   THAT OLD FRENCH PRESIDENT

04:27.801 --> 04:29.735

04:29.737 --> 04:32.271
     HE WAS LIKE A GRANDPA
      AND SHE STILL HAD TO
         SPIT HIS JIZZ.

04:32.273 --> 04:35.374
         WELL, I'M NOT
    SPITTING ANYONE'S JIZZ.

        IN THIS UNIFORM.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.480
   IT'S NOT REALLY MY COLOR.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.750
 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IN A RAPE
   SITUATION IS YELL, "FIRE!"

04:44.752 --> 04:46.451
   WHY WOULDN'T I YELL RAPE?

04:46.453 --> 04:48.420
    NO ONE RESPONDS TO THAT.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.656
     WHO ARE YOUR FRIENDS?

04:50.658 --> 04:53.358
      SO BASICALLY YOU PUT
      YOUR LAUNDRY INSIDE
           THE UNIT.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.826
 AND THEN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE

04:54.828 --> 04:58.030

  THAT YOU'RE A GREAT SISTER.

05:11.412 --> 05:14.913
      I'VE GOT MY BUCKET.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.849

  YOU CAN JUST MOVE OVER AND,

05:17.851 --> 05:19.384

05:31.065 --> 05:32.664
YOU'RE KIDDING. THAT'S OUR BOSS?

05:36.736 --> 05:38.403

      'CAUSE OF THE MUSIC.

       I MEAN LOOK AT ME.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.890
         THANKS, DUMMY.

08:44.892 --> 08:48.126
         OKAY, SEE YOU,
    WOULDN'T WANT TO BE YOU.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.228
        I DON'T MEAN IT.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.898
I'LL BE BACK, THE TERMINATOR.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.833
I'LL BE BACK.

08:54.835 --> 08:58.303
  LIKE, I'M GOING TO COME BACK
         AFTER THE GYM.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.189
             - HEY.
             - HEY.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.992
      THANKS FOR THE TEXT
     BUT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
    TO CALL, NOT COME OVER.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.627
              OH.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.329
          SORRY, WELL,
  I'M HERE NOW SO COME ON OUT.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.830
        LET'S FUCK LIKE
        HORNY TEENAGERS.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.732
            COME ON.
            COME ON.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.701
             UH...

09:29.703 --> 09:32.571
       YEAH, NO. I CAN'T
        BECAUSE I FORGOT
    TONIGHT WAS DATE NIGHT.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.739
      JULIE IS COMING HOME
    AND WE'RE GOING TO PLAY
          "SCRABBLE."

09:34.741 --> 09:36.341
           WHAT? GOD.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.276
       - YOUR WIFE SUCKS.
        - YEAH, I KNOW.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.679
   EVERYTHING BUT YOUR DICK.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.882
           I STAYED
       IN THAT HOTEL ROOM
         FOR TWO WEEKS

09:43.884 --> 09:45.317
   SO THAT MY SISTER WOULDN'T
     KNOW I GOT KICKED OUT

09:45.319 --> 09:47.152
       OF REHAB FOR YOU.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.820
             YEAH,
     I'M THE ONE WHO FORGED
       THE RELEASE PAPERS

09:48.822 --> 09:49.854
     SO THE COURT WOULDN'T
     BE ALL OVER YOUR ASS.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.256
        IT WAS THE LEAST
         YOU COULD DO.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.624
        I'M PRETTY SURE
   THERAPISTS AREN'T SUPPOSED

09:52.626 --> 09:54.225
 TO FUCK THEIR REHAB PATIENTS.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.294
   THERAPISTS ARE SCREWED UP
 PEOPLE. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.363
       YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
      SHARON STONED ME IN
     THE OFFICE, REMEMBER?

09:58.365 --> 10:00.231
         - THAT'S HOT.
       - IT WAS VERY HOT.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.833
        "BASIC INSTINCT"
        IS A GREAT MOVIE.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.134
          BUT I CAN'T.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.669
    YOU SAID WHEN I GET BACK
        TO MY SISTER'S,

10:04.671 --> 10:06.905
          WE'D BE BACK
     ON A REGULAR SCHEDULE.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.306
      I NEED TO GET LAID.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.308
           YOU KNOW,
   I THINK AS YOUR THERAPIST

10:10.310 --> 10:13.912
     YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO
  TO A MEETING TONIGHT, OKAY?

10:13.914 --> 10:17.048
            I'M WET.

10:17.050 --> 10:20.752
       FINE, MEETINGS ARE
   GREAT PLACES TO GET LAID.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.621
      OKAY, I CAN FUCK YOU
           IN THE CAR

10:22.623 --> 10:24.789
     BUT I HAVE 10 MINUTES
    AND THAT'S IT. LET'S GO.

10:30.863 --> 10:35.333
        FROM YOUR HIPS.
        FROM YOUR HIPS.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.235
      WATCH YOUR FOOTWORK.

10:43.876 --> 10:46.277
     I PROMISE I WON'T MAKE
          YOU DO MORE.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.985
          OKAY. UM...

10:53.987 --> 10:57.188
             OKAY.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.791
           KRAV MAGA.
WE HAVE ONE RULE, ONE RULE ONLY.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.660
      NEVER STOP FIGHTING!

11:01.662 --> 11:03.762
            - HIYA!
            - HIYA!

11:03.764 --> 11:05.296
THANK YOU.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.298
       I'M HERE MONDAYS,

11:07.300 --> 11:10.735
      WEDNESDAYS, FRIDAYS
     AT 8:00 P.M., WEEKENDS
       I'M HERE AT NOON.

11:10.737 --> 11:12.270
      THE REST OF THE TIME

11:12.272 --> 11:16.041
  I'M STUDYING TO BECOME A NUN
      SO DON'T BOTHER ME.

11:19.078 --> 11:21.680
            - HELLO.
   - HEY, KELLY. GREAT CLASS.

11:21.682 --> 11:24.249
    AMAZING FOCUS TONIGHT.
            REALLY.

11:24.251 --> 11:27.318
 I'M TOTALLY RETHINKING MY PLAN
  OF KNIFING YOU IN AN ALLEY.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.821
         I DIDN'T KNOW
       YOU HAD THAT PLAN.

11:29.823 --> 11:32.190
       HEY HAVE YOU SEEN
         ALICIA AROUND?

11:32.192 --> 11:33.792
         I JUST THOUGHT
      THAT I WOULD SEE HER

11:33.794 --> 11:35.760
       'CAUSE SHE USUALLY
      WORKS OUT AT NIGHT.

11:35.762 --> 11:36.928
   I MEAN, THANK GOD I DIDN'T
       'CAUSE IT'S JUST--

11:36.930 --> 11:38.163
      IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE,
           YOU KNOW,

11:38.165 --> 11:39.898
       SHE CAN'T WORK OUT
        IN THE MORNING.

11:39.900 --> 11:40.899
    AND SHE DOESN'T GET DOWN
    WITH HER PARALEGAL STUFF

11:40.901 --> 11:42.834
        UNTIL LIKE 7:00.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.302
     AND THEN SHE CAN ONLY
        REALLY WORK OUT
     BETWEEN 7:30 AND 8:30

11:44.304 --> 11:45.904
    BECAUSE SHE HAS TO WATCH
    "THE GOOD WIFE" AT 9:00.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.906
      AND SHE'S NOT HERE.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.375
      I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.876
      I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
         TELL YOU THIS

11:51.878 --> 11:53.344
       BUT I REALLY THINK
       I PULLED SOMETHING

11:53.346 --> 11:55.447
       LIKE, I MEAN GLUTS
          BACK THERE.

11:55.449 --> 11:58.983
   I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE
   HAD THOSE BEERS PRE-CLASS.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.219
          THAT'S OKAY.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.989
   WHY DON'T WE GO SOMEWHERE
   AND CONTINUE HAVING BEERS?

12:04.991 --> 12:07.759
  AND THEN GET SOME THAI FOOD
         OR SOMETHING.

12:07.761 --> 12:08.960
    DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

12:08.962 --> 12:10.495
          I LOVE THAI.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.064
       IT'S JUST IT SUCKS
  BECAUSE I CAN'T TONIGHT SO,

12:13.066 --> 12:14.999
  YOU KNOW, MY SISTER IS BACK

12:15.001 --> 12:16.935
  AND I JUST-- I DON'T WANT TO
 LEAVE HER HOME ALONE TOO LONG.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.002
      SHE'S STILL FRAGILE.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.938
          OKAY, COOL.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.974
      I MEAN NOT COOL THAT
        SHE'S FRAGILE OR
     WHATEVER. I'M SORRY--

12:22.976 --> 12:24.476
      WHAT'S UP, SHORTIES?

12:24.478 --> 12:26.077
             WHAT?

12:26.079 --> 12:30.415
       I WAS JUST TRYING
    TO MAKE SOME SMALL TALK.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.783
              BYE.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.852
              BYE.

12:33.854 --> 12:39.257
      TODAY WE'RE TALKING
   ABOUT OUR BOTTOMS, SO P.S.
          ON THE TOPS.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.093
  WATCH THE TRIGGER MATERIAL,
            PLEASE.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.895
         SORRY, DENISE.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.998
TALKING ABOUT OUR ROCK BOTTOMS.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.267
          I WAS LIVING
     A PRETTY AWESOME LIFE.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.303
  I WORKED AT "THE OPRAH SHOW"
          IN CHICAGO.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.305
   I STARTED AS AN ASSISTANT,

12:54.307 --> 12:56.274
        WORKED MY WAY UP
     TO ASSOCIATE PRODUCER.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.276
  I WAS MAKING A LOT OF MONEY.

12:58.278 --> 13:02.781
 AND I WAS DOING A LOT OF BLOW,
      LIKE, A LOT OF BLOW.

13:02.783 --> 13:04.783
   AND YOU KNOW HOW BLOW IS.
      IT'S VERY SLIMMING.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.318
   I HAD LIKE ABS TO MY NECK.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.889
    I LOOKED LIKE A FUCKING
 PAKISTANI MARK-PAUL GOSSELAAR.

13:10.891 --> 13:14.192
       THAT'S ZACK MORRIS
   FROM "SAVED BY THE BELL."

13:14.194 --> 13:15.560
  EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT.

13:15.562 --> 13:21.332
    I HAD THAT SHIT ON LOCK,
        OR SO I THOUGHT.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.334
     CUT TO TWO YEARS LATER

13:23.336 --> 13:26.805
    AND I WAKE UP COMPLETELY
     NAKED IN AN ABANDONED
       CONSTRUCTION SITE

13:26.807 --> 13:29.407
   OUTSIDE OF WRIGLEY FIELD.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.042
      HOW DID I GET THERE?

13:31.044 --> 13:34.212
         I DON'T KNOW.
  I DON'T EVEN LIKE BASEBALL.

13:34.214 --> 13:38.116
        ANYWAY WHEN I...

13:38.118 --> 13:42.020
         DID MAKE IT TO
  WORK THAT DAY, I GOT FIRED.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.956
     OPRAH WAS VERY STRICT
          ABOUT THAT.

13:44.958 --> 13:49.460
   I WAS THIS CLOSE TO OPRAH,
     LITERALLY THIS CLOSE.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.063
  SHE WOULD WALK RIGHT BY ME.

13:52.065 --> 13:55.133
    AND I THREW IT ALL AWAY
      FOR DRUGS AND DICK--

13:55.135 --> 13:59.170
    MEDIOCRE, MEDIOCRE DICK.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.371
   PRETTY GOOD DRUGS THOUGH.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.275
           THANK YOU.

14:04.277 --> 14:07.078
    I DON'T, LIKE, CONSIDER
     LOSING A JOB A BOTTOM.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.112
    IT WASN'T JUST ANY JOB.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.547
IT WAS A JOB WITH OPRAH WINFREY.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.283
 WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT OPRAH?

14:12.285 --> 14:13.551
            AMERICA.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.986
         SHE'S A BITCH.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.559
SHAN, THE SMOG INDEX
            IS AT 2.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.962
   IT'S A GREAT DAY. GET UP.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.964
           HEY, SHAN,

14:25.966 --> 14:29.033
I LAID OUT YOUR UNIFORM AND THE
SHOWER'S HOT AND READY FOR YOU.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.168
I'M GOING TO MAKE US BREAKFAST.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.302
             OKAY.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.637
YOU NEED TO GET UP.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.906
          I HEARD YOU.

14:34.908 --> 14:37.208
I'M EMPLOYEE
    OF THE MONTH SO I DON'T
        WANT TO BE LATE.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.943
       I KNOW YOU DON'T.

14:41.981 --> 14:43.481
  YOU SHOULDN'T EAT THAT CRAP.

14:43.483 --> 14:47.285
     YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN
    EDGY ALL MORNING, SHAN.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.520
 I THOUGHT THOSE MEETINGS WERE
SUPPOSED TO HELP MELLOW YOU OUT.

14:49.522 --> 14:52.957
      IT'S CALLED PROGRESS
        NOT PERFECTION.

14:52.959 --> 14:56.060
       AND I DON'T CHANGE
     THE FACT THAT I STILL
    LIVE IN THIS SHIT BOWL.

14:56.062 --> 15:00.031
HEY, IF YOU HATE FRESNO SO MUCH
     WHY DID YOU COME BACK?

15:00.033 --> 15:03.067
     OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE I'VE
     MADE A SERIES OF POOR
        LIFE DECISIONS.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.536
LOOK, POSITIVE THINKING
    MEANS POSITIVE RESULTS.

15:05.538 --> 15:09.173
       HEY, I OWN A HOME.
   THAT'S MY AMERICAN DREAM.

15:09.175 --> 15:12.377
      LOCATION, LOCATION,
           LOCATION.

15:25.357 --> 15:28.359
          HEY, NANCY.

15:32.231 --> 15:33.498
         WE'RE ACTUALLY
          GOING DOWN.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.599
           OH, YEAH?

15:34.601 --> 15:38.102
  I'LL TAKE THE RIDE WITH YOU.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.437
        YOU'RE NEW HERE.

15:39.439 --> 15:43.441
   I KNOW EVERYONE WHO WORKS
      IN THE HOTEL. SO...

15:43.443 --> 15:45.576
        HOW DO YOU LIKE
        THE JOB SO FAR?

15:45.578 --> 15:48.112
         I CLEAN ROOMS.
  HOW DO YOU THINK I LIKE IT?

15:48.114 --> 15:49.113
             RIGHT.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.016
      ENJOY YOUR BURRITO.

15:52.018 --> 15:53.685
   HAVE A GREAT DAY, LADIES.

15:58.490 --> 16:01.192
  I HATE THAT GUY. HE'S ALWAYS
     HERE WITH PROSTITUTES.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.261
  PROSTITUTES HAVE TO EAT TOO.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.096
       WELL, HE'S GROSS.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.598
           HE'S FINE.
    DON'T BE SO JUDGMENTAL.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.300
 WE'RE STILL NOT CLEANING 400.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.337
HIS ROOM SMELLS LIKE BURNT HAIR
   AND HE REUSES OLD CONDOMS.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.638
       NOBODY DOES THAT.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.073
            HE DOES.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.975
            - SHAN.
            - WHAT?

16:16.977 --> 16:19.677
       HE HANGS THEM OVER
      THE SHOWER ROD LIKE
         WIENER COZIES.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.646
       WELL, THAT'S FOUL.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.481
       I APPRECIATE YOUR
      CREATIVITY RIGHT NOW

16:23.483 --> 16:25.550
 BUT THIS ISN'T AN ART PROJECT.
  THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL JOB.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.185
 YOU TOLD ME TO STOCK MY CART.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.587
     I AM STOCKING MY CART.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.022
     YOU'RE OVER-STOCKING.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.457
        THAT IS WAY TOO
       MUCH TOILET PAPER.

16:32.459 --> 16:33.658
        NO ONE IS GOING
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM THAT MUCH.

16:45.471 --> 16:48.239
    UM, YOU KNOW, I'LL TAKE
       ROOMS 403 TO 408.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.674
        WELL, ALL RIGHT.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.409
   ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GOING
    TO BE FINE ON YOUR OWN?

16:51.411 --> 16:53.478
         I THINK I CAN
      CLEAN PUBES OFF SOAP
           BY MYSELF.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.346
           THANK YOU.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.476
     HEY, DID YOU GET THAT
      PICTURE I SENT YOU?

17:25.478 --> 17:27.377
          YES, I DID.
     YOU LOOK VERY HEALTHY.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.247
  YOU LOOK VERY WELL HYDRATED.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.782
 I JUST POSTED IT ON INSTAGRAM.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.650
  I HAVE 10,000 NEW FOLLOWERS.

17:32.652 --> 17:37.555
         LISTEN, I HAVE
      SOME VERY BIG NEWS.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.756
          WHAT IS IT?

17:38.758 --> 17:40.691
    I GAVE JULIE THE LETTER.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.761
        I'M FINALLY OUT,
       LIKE, REALLY OUT.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.064
           WAIT, WHY?
        WHAT DID YOU DO?

17:46.066 --> 17:47.765
     I GAVE HER THE LETTER.
     I TOLD HER EVERYTHING.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.434
             <i> WHAT?</i>

17:49.436 --> 17:50.635
    YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T THINK
     I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE

17:50.637 --> 17:52.370
 TO DO IT BUT I SAW THE MOMENT.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.572
  IT SORT OF PRESENTED ITSELF,
 AND THEN I WAS PRESENT FOR IT.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.541
 AND IT JUST KIND OF HAPPENED.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.776
 <i> SHE DIDN'T TAKE IT VERY WELL.</i>

17:58.778 --> 18:01.079
         BUT, YOU KNOW,
 THAT'S GOING TO BE HER THING.

18:01.081 --> 18:03.381
  I WANT TO BE A REAL COUPLE,
             OKAY?

18:03.383 --> 18:05.183
I WANT TO GO TO MOVIES WITH YOU

18:05.185 --> 18:07.118
   AND SIT AT THE SAME TABLE
         IN RESTAURANTS

18:07.120 --> 18:08.553
      AND NOT HAVE TO FUCK
          IN THE BUSH.

18:08.555 --> 18:12.523
      - WHAT DO YOU THINK?
    - WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

18:12.525 --> 18:16.260
 WELL, BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME THAT
YOU WANTED ME TO LEAVE MY WIFE.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.663
    YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T THINK
     YOU'D ACTUALLY DO IT.

18:18.665 --> 18:21.399
      GOD! WHO DOES THAT?
            GO BACK.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.734
     WELL, I CAN'T GO BACK.
   I JUST TOLD HER AND I'D--

18:23.736 --> 18:25.536
        GO BACK, EDWIN.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.606
      SHANNON, I LOVE YOU,
           ALL RIGHT?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.808
          I'M IN THIS.
   YOU'RE IN THIS TOO, RIGHT?

18:30.810 --> 18:33.177
  LOOK, I CAN'T TAKE THIS KIND
     OF PRESSURE RIGHT NOW.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.846
     HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN
        YOU CAN'T TAKE--

18:34.848 --> 18:37.281
     <i> I'M NOT WHAT-- WHAT?</i>

19:03.475 --> 19:05.510
     HEY, CAN YOU COME BACK
             IN 10?

19:05.512 --> 19:07.345
      DO YOU WANT TO FUCK?

19:07.347 --> 19:09.447
          HEY, ALICIA,
      IT'S MARTHA CALLING.

19:09.449 --> 19:12.283
       I WAS JUST CALLING

19:12.285 --> 19:14.552
    BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE YOU
     AT THE GYM LAST NIGHT

19:14.554 --> 19:17.822
         AND THAT MAKES
       ME REALLY WORRIED.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.791
       YOU CALL ME CHAMP,

19:20.793 --> 19:22.527
   AND I'LL FUCK YOU SO HARD
   YOU'LL COME OUT YOUR BUTT.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.666
 I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID

19:28.668 --> 19:30.768
  AND I TOLD HER THAT YOU CAN
 ONLY STAY FOR TWO MORE WEEKS.

19:30.770 --> 19:35.406
 I MEAN, I HAVEN'T TOLD HER YET
BUT I'M GOING TO TELL HER, SO...

19:35.408 --> 19:37.441
  BUT IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT
       TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.318
      GO-- GO TO THE BED.

19:51.790 --> 19:54.692
  UH, I MEAN, I KNOW YOU SAID
    YOU DIDN'T WANT TO TALK.

19:54.694 --> 19:58.863
 SO, IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT, OKAY?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.431
       SO, I DON'T KNOW,

20:00.433 --> 20:02.600
MAYBE WE CAN HANG OUT AGAIN SOON
          OR SOMETHING

20:02.602 --> 20:05.836
  OR JUST CALL ME OR TEXT ME.

20:09.441 --> 20:10.608
          - GET DOWN.
            - OKAY.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.376
             YEAH.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.212
         GONNA GET IT.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.913
           OKAY, BYE.

20:40.839 --> 20:42.740
            SHANNON?

20:54.721 --> 20:56.621
            SHANNON?

21:00.926 --> 21:02.860
         HOUSEKEEPING.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.677

21:19.679 --> 21:20.945

        YOU WERE RIGHT.

21:26.386 --> 21:29.687
          - TAG TEAM!
   - GET AWAY FROM MY LITTLE
            SISTER!

21:29.689 --> 21:31.489
   YOU STILL HAVE YOUR PUSSY,
             BABY.

21:31.491 --> 21:32.823
     JUMP BACK ON MY DICK.

21:32.825 --> 21:33.991
YOU'RE A DISGUSTING
         PIECE OF SHIT.

21:37.929 --> 21:39.730
             SHAN!

21:39.732 --> 21:40.998
       NO, NO, NO, SHAN.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.533
  GOD, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

21:42.535 --> 21:44.902
    WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

21:44.904 --> 21:47.738
WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING?
      WHAT THE FUCK, SHAN?

21:47.740 --> 21:48.806
             - GOD.
            - OKAY.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.807
         - OH, MY GOD.
         - OKAY. OKAY.

21:49.809 --> 21:53.744
      OKAY. OKAY. SHANNON.

21:53.746 --> 21:57.348
  IS HE DEAD? HOLY SHIT, SHIT.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.416
       HE'S DEAD SHANNON.

21:58.418 --> 22:00.017
    DID I JUST KILL SOMEONE?

22:00.019 --> 22:02.687
  I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING, SHAN.

22:02.689 --> 22:03.988
DID I JUST FUCKING KILL SOMEONE?

22:03.990 --> 22:05.623
         CALM, BE CALM.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.625
         - OH, MY GOD.
 - OKAY. IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

22:07.627 --> 22:10.494
     WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
    WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

22:10.496 --> 22:11.829
   HE WAS RAPING YOU, RIGHT?

22:11.831 --> 22:13.631
             - YES.
        - RIGHT? RAPING?

22:13.633 --> 22:15.633
           100% RAPE.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.435
       THAT'S WAS A RAPE.

22:17.437 --> 22:20.471
         HE WAS RAPING
      THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.707
 OKAY, THEN HE WAS RAPING YOU.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.642
   WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT?

22:33.486 --> 22:35.486

       HE'D MAKE FRIENDS.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.131
             HELLO?

22:55.508 --> 22:56.574
    DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

22:56.576 --> 22:58.609
      HOW DO I PROVE THAT
          HE RAPED ME?

22:58.611 --> 23:00.478
       I NEED YOUR HELP.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.580
             FINE.

23:02.582 --> 23:03.914
  WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

EXCUSE ME.

23:07.754 --> 23:10.855

23:28.007 --> 23:29.740
    OH REALLY? 'CAUSE I GOT
        A STRANGE CALL.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.108

         OR SOMETHING.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.544
      NO, I'M JUST REALLY
      INTENSELY CLEANING.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.912
   IT'S REALLY DIRTY IN HERE.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.047
      OKAY, LISTEN TO ME,

- WHATEVER.
        - NO.

23:55.667 --> 23:56.767
       WE NEED TO HURRY.

            - OKAY.
       - WHAT DID YOU DO?

23:58.571 --> 23:59.804
   I'M JUST BEING RESPECTFUL.
   HE DESERVES SOME DIGNITY.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.071
       EVERYONE DESERVES
         SOME DIGNITY.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.941
        - EVEN RAPISTS?
      - YES, EVEN RAPISTS.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.709

24:18.825 --> 24:20.191
   OVER AND OUT, GOOD BUDDY.

24:35.073 --> 24:36.707
WHERE ARE WE TAKING HIM?

24:36.709 --> 24:38.476
THE PRESIDENTIAL
        SUITE IS EMPTY.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.084
          LUNCH TIME.

24:51.656 --> 24:52.790
     GOOD MORNING, LADIES.

24:58.630 --> 25:00.197
      SORRY. I DON'T KNOW
       WHY SHE'S BARKING.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.099
          SHIT SHEETS.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.535
     THE SHEETS ARE FILLED
        WITH SHIT. YEAH.

25:04.537 --> 25:05.669
    SOMEONE HAD AN ACCIDENT.

25:05.671 --> 25:06.904
       A BACHELOR PARTY.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.772
        HAVE A GOOD DAY.
     ENJOY YOUR STAY HERE.

25:14.145 --> 25:16.947
   SHIT. HE LIVES IN FRESNO.

25:16.949 --> 25:19.116
      HOPE HE DOESN'T HAVE
          FAMILY HERE

25:19.118 --> 25:21.118
      AND THEY DON'T COME
        LOOKING FOR HIM.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.687
     MAYBE HE DOESN'T HAVE
    ANY FAMILY. OUR PARENTS
           ARE DEAD.

25:23.689 --> 25:26.757
  YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO
WOULD TURN THAT INTO A POSITIVE.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.225
         LOOK AT THIS.

25:28.227 --> 25:31.562
 DUDE WON A BRONZE IN BEIJING.

25:31.564 --> 25:33.197
    YOU KILLED AN OLYMPIAN.

25:33.199 --> 25:36.767
  ONLY IF YOU CONSIDER HAMMER
     THROW A SPORT WHICH--

25:37.837 --> 25:39.036
          OH NO. FUCK!

25:39.038 --> 25:40.704
WHO WOULD CALL HIM?

25:40.706 --> 25:42.139
     FUCK! IT'S HIS SISTER.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.807
   OKAY, JUST GIVE IT TO ME.

25:43.809 --> 25:45.943
     I'LL JUST LET IT GO TO
    VOICE MAIL, THEN WE'LL--

25:45.945 --> 25:47.912
<i> HELLO?</i>

25:47.914 --> 25:50.080

25:59.225 --> 26:04.995
         BORIS LIP-KA.

26:04.997 --> 26:08.165
  AT THE TONE LEAVE A MESSAGE.

26:08.167 --> 26:12.570
             BEEP!

26:12.572 --> 26:14.271
         <i> HEY. IT'S ME.</i>

26:14.273 --> 26:16.206
    <i> I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY</i>
<i> JERKING OFF IN YOUR HOTEL ROOM</i>

26:16.208 --> 26:18.342
     <i> LIKE A DISGUSTING PIG</i>
          <i> RIGHT NOW,</i>

26:18.344 --> 26:21.312
   <i> BUT YOU BETTER COME HOME</i>
<i>FOR DAD'S BIRTHDAY PARTY TODAY.</i>

26:21.314 --> 26:24.048
    <i> I'M SO FUCKING SICK OF</i>
    <i> DEALING WITH THESE TWO</i>
      <i> INVALIDS ON MY OWN!</i>

26:24.050 --> 26:26.250
  <i> YOU BETTER BE HERE BY 3:00</i>

26:26.252 --> 26:28.719
   <i> OR I SWEAR I'LL COME GET</i>
          <i> YOU MYSELF.</i>

26:28.721 --> 26:33.123
   OKAY, SO THEY'RE NOT CLOSE
 AND HIS PARENTS ARE INVALIDS.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.658
 I FEEL LIKE THIS IS GOOD NEWS.

26:34.660 --> 26:35.993
    WHEN HE DOESN'T SHOW UP
            AT 3:00

26:35.995 --> 26:38.829
      HIS SISTER IS GOING
    TO COME LOOKING FOR HIM.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.966
    WHAT IF WE DUMP HIS BODY
       AT DRY CREEK CANAL

26:41.968 --> 26:43.233
  AND MAKE IT LOOK A SUICIDE?

26:43.235 --> 26:45.069
           ISN'T THAT
  WHERE EVERYONE DUMPS BODIES?

26:45.071 --> 26:46.971
  HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT?

27:02.821 --> 27:04.722
           OF COURSE,
  THE RAPIST HAS A RAPIST VAN.

27:04.724 --> 27:05.923
         LET'S HURRY UP
     AND GET HIM IN THERE.

27:13.331 --> 27:16.300
   LOOK, SHAN, HE WAS TRYING
      TO BE A GOOD PERSON.

27:16.302 --> 27:17.735
       HE WAS IN TO YOGA.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.336
        WE CAN STILL GO
         TO THE POLICE.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.838
        WE'RE NOT GOING
      TO THE POLICE, OKAY?

27:20.840 --> 27:23.273
     WE'RE DUMPING THE BODY
         AT DRY CREEK.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.876
UNLESS YOU CAN FIND HIS PARENTS'
     ADDRESS IN HIS PHONE.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.277
     AND THEN-- THEN WHAT?

27:27.279 --> 27:29.847
 JUST PUT HIM ON THE DOORSTEP,
         RING THE BELL?

27:29.849 --> 27:32.049
        "HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
     HERE'S YOUR DEAD SON."

27:32.051 --> 27:34.118
     CALM DOWN, ALL RIGHT?

27:34.120 --> 27:36.420
           CALM DOWN.

27:36.422 --> 27:39.423
JUST FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT WAY
  TO MAKE HIS BODY DISAPPEAR.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.091
       GIVE ME THE PHONE.
      JUST GIVE IT TO ME.

27:44.696 --> 27:47.164
     ALL RIGHT, HERE IT IS.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.700
     MOM AND DAD'S ADDRESS,
         BOOM AND BOOM.

27:49.702 --> 27:51.969
       WHAT ARE WE GOING
    TO DO WHEN WE GET THERE?

27:51.971 --> 27:53.871
         I HAVE A PLAN.

28:05.884 --> 28:08.285
USE YOUR KEY!

28:09.287 --> 28:12.089
          WHO ARE YOU?

28:12.091 --> 28:13.991
    I'M A FRIEND OF BORIS'S,
   AS YOU MUST BE HIS SISTER.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.793
          - YES, I AM.
       - I'M HIS FRIEND.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.761
       BORIS DOESN'T HAVE
          ANY FRIENDS.

28:17.763 --> 28:20.731
         I'M HIS SISTER
  AND I'M NOT EVEN HIS FRIEND.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.099
             WELL--

28:29.974 --> 28:32.910
           - WELL--
         - WHERE IS HE?

28:32.912 --> 28:39.817
   UH...HE'S-- BORIS IS MORE
      THAN A FRIEND TO ME.
       I'M HIS LIFE GURU.

28:39.819 --> 28:42.352
       OH, THIS IS GOOD.
 SO HE'S GOT A LIFE COACH NOW?

28:42.354 --> 28:43.420
             GURU.

28:43.422 --> 28:44.822
           OH, GURU.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.290
            - YEAH.
         - INTERESTING.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.858
     SO WHAT KIND OF STUFF
     DO YOU ADVISE HIM ON?

28:47.860 --> 28:49.326
      THE BEST PROSTITUTES
            TO FUCK?

28:49.328 --> 28:50.961
    I CAN SEE WHY YOU WOULD
            SAY THAT

28:50.963 --> 28:53.997
 AND THAT HAS BEEN HIS PAINFUL
     REALITY FOR SOME TIME,

28:53.999 --> 28:55.733
         BUT I'M HOPING
   WITH MY HELP AND GUIDANCE

28:55.735 --> 28:59.169
  WE CAN MOVE HIM THROUGH THAT
   AND I CAN HELP HIM CHANGE.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.004
       WELL, IT'S TOO BAD
      THAT HE WASN'T HERE

29:01.006 --> 29:03.507
          TO HELP ME
      WHEN I WAS CHANGING
      POP'S DIAPERS, HUH?

29:03.509 --> 29:05.109
       COULDN'T HELP HIM
   WITH THAT I GUESS, RIGHT?

29:05.111 --> 29:06.977
 ARE YOU FEELING A LOT OF PAIN?

29:06.979 --> 29:08.245
             - YES.
        - CAN I COME IN?

29:10.215 --> 29:13.083
         OKAY, COME IN.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.955
          GURU, GURU.

29:17.957 --> 29:18.956
YES, I'M A--

29:18.958 --> 29:21.892
          GURU, GURU.

29:21.894 --> 29:23.794
GURU.

29:25.897 --> 29:29.933
       GURU, GURU, GURU.

29:36.308 --> 29:38.976
         SO I'M HERE TO
        REPRESENT BORIS.

29:38.978 --> 29:42.980
            AND HE--
 HE HAS COME TO THE REALIZATION

29:42.982 --> 29:45.115
    THAT HE HAS BEEN LIVING
          IN THE PAST.

29:45.117 --> 29:48.118
      AND ALTHOUGH WINNING
    AN OLYMPIC BRONZE MEDAL

29:48.120 --> 29:50.020
  IS A MAJOR LIFE ACHIEVEMENT,

29:50.022 --> 29:52.790
        HE'S NEVER BEEN
 ABLE TO REALLY MOVE PAST THIS.

29:52.792 --> 29:59.229
    SO WE'VE DECIDED THAT'S
  IT'S DUE TO FEAR OF FAILURE.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.831
    HE'S AFRAID OF FAILING!

30:04.469 --> 30:07.404
   SO WE'VE DECIDED THE BEST
        THING FOR BORIS

30:07.406 --> 30:12.209
 RIGHT NOW IN ORDER FOR HIM TO
 START OVER IS TO LEAVE FRESNO
            FOREVER.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.211
    TO NEVER EVER COME BACK,

30:14.213 --> 30:17.247
       TO SEVER ALL TIES
        WITH HIS FAMILY

30:17.249 --> 30:20.284
     AND TO NEVER EVER TALK
         TO YOU AGAIN.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.561
  THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO DEAL
       WITH ALL DAY LONG.

30:30.563 --> 30:35.265
          HE REQUESTED
 THAT I GIVE YOU HIS BACKPACK.

30:57.856 --> 31:01.491
  BORIS, DON'T LEAVE ME HERE!

31:01.493 --> 31:04.394
       BORIS IS SO SORRY
          THAT HE HAS
      TO LEAVE THE FAMILY,

31:04.396 --> 31:05.629
          BUT HE KNOWS
       IT'S THE ONLY WAY

31:05.631 --> 31:07.064
     HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE
          TO GROW UP.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.467
             POOPY!

31:11.936 --> 31:13.637
          YOU BETTER--

31:16.341 --> 31:17.541
    YOU THINK SHE BOUGHT IT?

31:17.543 --> 31:19.443
          I THINK SO.
      BUT THIS WILL HELP.

31:20.945 --> 31:22.512
           "SELL THIS
     AND GET OUT OF FRESNO.

31:22.514 --> 31:25.983
          I LOVE YOU.
       BUT I CAN'T CHANGE
        ANOTHER DIAPER."

31:25.985 --> 31:27.584
        X-O-X-O, BORIS.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.320
       YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.456
  WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH HIM?
 SHOULD WE JUST LEAVE HIM HERE?

31:32.458 --> 31:35.893
          NO, DUMBASS
       WE SHOULD ROLL HIM
       BACK TO THE HOTEL

31:35.895 --> 31:37.294
   AND FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.229
           GOD, SHAN,
        DO YOU JUST HAVE
     TO SMOKE ALL THE TIME?

31:39.231 --> 31:41.098
           YES, I DO.

31:41.100 --> 31:42.299
           YOU KNOW,
     WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF
   A SERIOUS DROUGHT, RIGHT?

31:42.301 --> 31:44.101
              YES.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.336
      I MEAN, DO YOU JUST
      WANT THE WHOLE PLACE
      TO GO UP IN FLAMES?

31:46.338 --> 31:50.173
   ACTUALLY, YEAH. THAT WOULD
   KIND OF SOLVE OUR PROBLEM,
     IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

31:52.043 --> 31:54.177
    WE KNOW SOMEBODY WHO HAS
   A PLACE RIGHT AROUND HERE.

31:54.179 --> 31:56.179
             WE DO?

32:00.919 --> 32:02.119
            GERALD?

32:02.121 --> 32:03.387
     WHAT THE FUCK, MARTHA.

32:03.389 --> 32:05.589
       BE QUIET AND ADMIT
       IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

32:05.591 --> 32:08.258
    ALL RIGHT. AND YOU WERE
  SAYING THE BREED WAS A DANE?

32:08.260 --> 32:09.927
          GREAT DANE.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.695
         - A GREAT ONE?
- YEAH, THAT'S WHY HE'S SO BIG.

32:11.697 --> 32:12.963
          OKAY. SO...

32:17.635 --> 32:19.670
        YOU DO REMEMBER?

32:22.040 --> 32:23.607
    COME ON, MAN. MY SISTER.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.008
           I'M SORRY.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.443
    - HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
             - HEY.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.078
              HEY.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.680
 THESE ARE OLD FRIENDS OF MINE,
      SHANNON AND MARTHA.

32:29.682 --> 32:31.682
   IS THIS THE SCOOTER GIRL?

32:31.684 --> 32:33.383
     HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

32:33.385 --> 32:35.619
     YOU TOLD ME ABOUT HER
   ON ONE OF OUR FIRST DATES.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.087
        WOW. YOU REALLY
         LISTEN TO ME.

32:37.089 --> 32:38.488
        I LISTEN TO YOU
      WHEN YOU TALK, BABY.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.257
  BUT YOU LOOK THE OTHER WAY.
        IT'S INCREDIBLE.

32:40.259 --> 32:41.591
             YEAH.

32:41.593 --> 32:43.493
       WHAT'S IN THE BIN?

32:43.495 --> 32:46.330
  REALLY HOPE IT'S A DEAD DOG
 BECAUSE WE COULD USE THE CASH.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.198
  SENSITIVITY, HONEY, PLEASE.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.667
   I'M SORRY. WE REALLY HOPE
  IT'S YOUR DEAD DOG. PLEASE?

32:50.669 --> 32:52.269
         THAT'S BORIS.
      HE JUST PASSED AWAY,

32:52.271 --> 32:54.204
        SO WE'RE HOPING
      TO GET HIM CREMATED.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.106
      GERALD WAS SAYING WE
     COULD HAVE THE FRIENDS
    AND MY FAMILY DISCOUNT.

32:56.108 --> 32:58.008
           I'M SORRY.

32:58.010 --> 33:01.278
           YOU KNOW,
       THIS IS THE REASON
     WHY WE'RE STUCK HERE.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.747
     THIS, BULLSHIT FRIENDS
       AND FAMILY THING.

33:03.749 --> 33:07.384
      NOT EVERYONE IS YOUR
       FAMILY AND ALMOST
     NO ONE IS YOUR FRIEND.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.519
          CAN WE WALK
      AROUND THE CEMETERY
    AND DO THIS. IT'S JUST--

33:09.521 --> 33:13.757
       WE ALSO-- WE NEED
  TO GET THE BIN CREMATED TOO.

33:13.759 --> 33:16.760
     THERE ARE NO DISCOUNTS
     AND THE BIN IS EXTRA.

33:16.762 --> 33:19.062
          THAT'S FINE.

33:19.064 --> 33:20.731
          WE CAN PAY.

33:20.733 --> 33:22.532
             OKAY.
   HAND ME THE TAPE MEASURE.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.468
FOR WHAT? WHY DO YOU NEED THE--
 WHY DO NEED THE TAPE MEASURE?

33:24.470 --> 33:26.036
 - WE HAVE TO MEASURE FOR THE--
       - WE ALREADY KNOW.

33:26.038 --> 33:27.337
      NO, WE MEASURED HIM.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.638
     IT'S THE AVERAGE SIZE
        OF A GREAT DANE.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.073
        IT'S FIVE FOOT,
     SOMETHING, SOMETHING.

33:30.075 --> 33:32.409
         JUST CHARGE US
      A GREAT DANE PRICE.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.144
    THE EXTRA, EXTRA LARGE.
           IT'S FINE.

33:34.146 --> 33:36.046
     - YOU GUYS CAN LEAVE.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEASURE HIM.

33:36.048 --> 33:38.015
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEASURE HIM.
    - I HAVE TO MEASURE HIM.

33:39.018 --> 33:40.751
         WHAT THE FUCK?

33:40.753 --> 33:42.652
   WE SAID DON'T MEASURE IT!

33:48.726 --> 33:50.560
           I'M SORRY.
   WE NEED TO CALL THE COPS.

33:50.562 --> 33:51.795
           WHAT FOR?

33:51.797 --> 33:53.397
        - I'M WITH RUBY.
           - SHUT UP.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.265
       WE OWN A BUSINESS,
           ALL RIGHT?

33:55.267 --> 33:57.501
    WE CAN LOSE EVERYTHING!
 THERE'S A HUMAN BODY IN HERE.

33:57.503 --> 33:59.302
    I UNDERSTAND THAT, OKAY?
            LISTEN.

33:59.304 --> 34:01.304
   - DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
          - YES, I DO.

34:01.306 --> 34:03.640
     WELL, I'M THE BUSINESS
       PERSON HERE, OKAY?

34:03.642 --> 34:05.776
          WE AGREED--
       WE AGREED ON THAT.

34:05.778 --> 34:08.145
    AND I SAY WE DON'T CALL
           THE COPS.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.780
  BECAUSE IF WE CALL THE COPS,
    WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

34:09.782 --> 34:11.715
      NOTHING'S GOING TO--
    THEY'RE GOING TO GO JAIL

34:11.717 --> 34:13.283
      AND WE'RE NOT GOING
        TO GET ANYTHING.

34:13.284 --> 34:14.451
           NO REWARD.

34:14.453 --> 34:15.652
            I MEAN,
     YOU THINK THAT THE GUY

34:15.654 --> 34:17.120
   WHO FOUND THE SLAVE GIRLS
            IN OHIO?

34:17.121 --> 34:18.221
            - OHIO?
        - ARIEL CASTRO.

34:18.223 --> 34:19.589
       YEAH. DO YOU THINK
        THAT THAT GUY--

34:19.591 --> 34:22.092
      DID HE GET ANYTHING?
       BECAUSE HE DIDN'T.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.726
           NO. UH-UH.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.829
      HE GOT, LIKE, A HUG
    FROM A LITTLE WHITE GIRL

34:25.831 --> 34:27.496
        AND THEN HE GOT,

34:27.498 --> 34:28.732
LIKE, AN EMBARRASSING INTERVIEW
      LIKE GOT AUTO-TUNED

34:28.734 --> 34:29.833
          AND, LIKE,
     PUT ALL OVER YOUTUBE.

34:29.835 --> 34:31.268
    THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.601
        NO, NOT AT ALL.

34:32.603 --> 34:35.572
    WE'RE GOING TO BLACKMAIL
       THESE TWO BITCHES.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.107
        ARE YOU KIDDING?

34:37.109 --> 34:39.576
         WE WANT 25,000
 TO GET OUT OF THIS BUTT CRACK

34:39.578 --> 34:40.677
   AND WE WANT IT BY SUNDAY.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.545
WHAT?

34:42.547 --> 34:44.114
 THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN COME UP
    WITH 25K IN THREE DAYS.

34:44.116 --> 34:45.449
        WE'RE IN FRESNO.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.583
            - YEAH.
   - I'M PRETTY SURE YOU CAN.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.853
   YOU SEEM VERY RESOURCEFUL.
     SO THREE DAYS, 25,000.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.556
             - 25?
     - WE CAN GO TO DETROIT
           WITH THAT.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.123
     WE COULD DEFINITELY GO
          TO DETROIT.

34:54.126 --> 34:56.126
      WE COULD MOVE THERE
    AND WE SET UP SHOP AND--

34:56.128 --> 34:58.495
    AND GUESS WHAT, YOU GET
     A CREMATION OUT OF IT.

34:58.497 --> 34:59.696
    YOU KNOW HOW GOOD WE ARE
         AT CREMATION?

34:59.698 --> 35:01.331
   WE'RE REALLY GOOD AT THEM.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.233
       A FUNERAL SERVICE
   LIKE YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE.

35:03.235 --> 35:05.869
  BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T
       GET THE MONEY THEN

35:05.871 --> 35:10.240
 YOU'RE GOING TO BE CHARGED FOR
 MANSLAUGHTER, SO THERE'S THAT.

35:10.242 --> 35:11.541
   WHAT ABOUT A PAYMENT PLAN?

35:11.543 --> 35:12.609
     NOBODY EVEN HAS THAT.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.311
            LAYAWAY?

35:14.313 --> 35:16.513
  CAN I GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT
  ADVICE AS FAR AS BODIES GO?

35:16.515 --> 35:20.484
    THAT GUY IS GOING TO ROT
  IF YOU DON'T GET HIM ON ICE.

35:20.486 --> 35:21.785
  THAT'S ALL. IT JUST HAPPENS.

35:21.787 --> 35:24.788
         IT'S BIOLOGY.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.290
    WHAT A STUPID ASS IDEA.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.592
            GERALD.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.460
    COME ON, HE BURNS THINGS
      FOR A LIVING, OKAY?

35:30.462 --> 35:33.363
    FOR $25,000! AND THEY'LL
   PROBABLY STILL TURN US IN.

35:33.365 --> 35:34.564
   THEY'RE NOT TURNING US IN.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.500
     SHE SAID SHE WANTS OUT
           OF FRESNO.

35:36.502 --> 35:39.870
      THE ONLY WAY TO GET
      25K IS DEALING DRUGS
        OR PROSTITUTION.

35:41.506 --> 35:43.673
     I JUST PAID THOUSANDS
      TO PUT YOU IN REHAB

35:43.675 --> 35:45.242
     AND I DOUBLE MORTGAGED
           MY HOUSE.

35:45.244 --> 35:47.577
      YOU'RE NOT BECOMING
         A PROSTITUTE.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.679
      I'M NOT HAVING SEX.
       I'LL BE YOUR PIMP.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.548
        I'M NOT TOUCHING
         SWEATY BALLS!

35:51.550 --> 35:53.650
   THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS SWEATY.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.520
      JUST PRETEND THEY'RE
       TINY LITTLE BOOBS.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.188
           OKAY FINE.
        WHAT ABOUT THIS?

35:58.190 --> 36:00.390
        WHAT IF WE PULL
         THE FIRE ALARM
          IN THE HOTEL

36:00.392 --> 36:01.725
          AND STEAL IT
      FROM THE FRONT DESK?

36:01.727 --> 36:03.527
   I WON'T JEOPARDIZE MY JOB.

36:03.529 --> 36:04.861
    LISTEN! IF WE DON'T GET
        RID OF THIS BODY

36:04.863 --> 36:06.463
     THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO
            TO JAIL

36:06.465 --> 36:07.831
    AND YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE
         A JOB, RIGHT?

36:07.833 --> 36:09.266
      YEAH, WELL, THANKS.
    THANKS TO YOUR SMOKING,

36:09.268 --> 36:10.834
   I FOR SURE LOST MY V.I.P.
         PARKING SPOT.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.802
             OKAY.

36:12.804 --> 36:15.839
   THIS IS GOOD. PEOPLE ONLY
   PAY IN CASH AT SEX SHOPS.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.941
         LET'S ROB IT.
            MM-HMM,
            MM-HMM.

36:17.943 --> 36:20.644
           IT'S GOOD.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.215
I CAN BARELY SEE.

36:25.217 --> 36:27.584
D.I.Y. TOILET PAPER,
          IT'S GENIUS.

36:27.586 --> 36:30.587
     I KNOW THIS PLACE AND
  THE WORKERS ARE ALWAYS HIGH.

36:30.589 --> 36:33.757
   IT'S EASY MONEY. COME ON.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.792
        THIS IS STUPID,
   SHAN, WE LOOK RIDICULOUS.

36:43.901 --> 36:45.602
DOES ANYBODY WORK
             HERE?

36:45.604 --> 36:47.537
     DOES ANYBODY WORK HERE?

36:47.539 --> 36:49.306
    YEAH, SORRY SMOKE BREAK.

36:51.275 --> 36:52.909
      OH, I LIKE THE T.P.
         ON YOUR HEAD.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.544
    IT'S ALL RAPEY AND SEXY.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.379
      I AM VERY INTO SCAT.

36:56.381 --> 36:58.348
    I NEED YOU TO COME OVER
         HERE RIGHT NOW

36:58.350 --> 37:00.750
  AND OPEN THIS CASH REGISTER
 AND I NEED ALL THE CASH, NOW.

37:00.752 --> 37:01.918
      YEAH, GET OVER HERE.

37:08.326 --> 37:10.927
    WHO KNEW SEX SHOPS WERE
   SUCH A CASH POOR BUSINESS.

37:10.929 --> 37:12.963
     THESE DILDOS HAVE GOT
     TO BE WORTH SOMETHING.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.894
       COME ON, LET'S GO.

38:21.666 --> 38:23.700
        I CAN'T BELIEVE
       WE ONLY MADE $400.

38:23.702 --> 38:26.436
        IT'S FAIR TO SAY
  WE OVERESTIMATED THE MARKET.

38:26.438 --> 38:27.871
        THAT'S A FUCKING
        UNDERSTATEMENT.

38:27.873 --> 38:29.506
       LESBIANS ARE POOR.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.474
        THEY ALWAYS ARE
    AND THEY ALWAYS WILL BE.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.576
   SHAN, DON'T BE HOMOPHOBIC
        RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

38:33.578 --> 38:34.911
     I ONLY TELL THE TRUTH.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.546
     WELL HERE'S THE TRUTH.

38:36.548 --> 38:39.349
        WHOSE GREAT IDEA
WAS IT TO ROB A SEX SHOP, OKAY?

38:39.351 --> 38:40.750
       IT'S WASN'T MINE.
        THAT WAS YOURS.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.519
       LET ME REMIND YOU.
    THAT WAS MY SECOND IDEA.

38:42.521 --> 38:43.953
MY FIRST WAS TO ROB HOTEL ROOMS,

38:43.955 --> 38:45.955
  BUT SOMEBODY WAS TOO SCARED
     OF GETTING IN TROUBLE.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.824
         YOU KNOW WHAT?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.592
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THESE DILDOS
  AND SHOVE THEM UP YOUR ASS?

38:49.594 --> 38:50.794
      OH, THAT'S A REALLY
       NICE THING TO SAY

38:50.796 --> 38:53.530
  TO A RECOVERING SEX ADDICT.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.332
      COULD YOU NOT BE SO
      ANNOYING RIGHT NOW--

38:55.334 --> 38:56.800
  YOU STOP BEING SO ANNOYING!

38:56.802 --> 38:59.336
         STOP IT! STOP.

38:59.338 --> 39:00.370
 YOU WANT TO GET TITTY FUCKED?

39:00.372 --> 39:01.838
      I'LL TITTY FUCK YOU!

39:01.840 --> 39:03.606
       - TITTY FUCK THIS!
 - NO! OKAY! YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

39:03.608 --> 39:06.042
       - OH, MY GOD. OW!
            - YEAH.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.877
      WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
          GET OFF ME!

39:07.879 --> 39:10.013
- NO, IT'S MY TURN TO HURT YOU.
  - WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU?

39:10.015 --> 39:11.981
      WE WOULDN'T BE HERE
     IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.850
       OH, SURE. BLAME ME
         FOR EVERYTHING
      WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.919
     BLAME ME FOR MOM DYING
       OF CANCER AND DAD

39:15.921 --> 39:18.088
        DRINKING HIMSELF
         TO DEATH. OW!

39:18.090 --> 39:19.989
         I ALREADY DO!

39:26.497 --> 39:28.131
      WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

39:28.133 --> 39:30.834
      WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

39:30.836 --> 39:32.869
 WE STILL HAVE A ROTTING CORPSE
         TO DEAL WITH.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.704
         YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:34.706 --> 39:37.374
        JUST TURN ME IN
      BECAUSE I DON'T GIVE
        A SHIT ANYMORE.

39:37.376 --> 39:39.409
             FUCK!

40:13.110 --> 40:14.744
     GIVE ME ONE OF THOSE.

40:16.714 --> 40:17.914
        YOU'RE WELCOME.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.949
      AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY
           THANK YOU?

40:19.951 --> 40:21.785
       MOST PEOPLE WOULD.

40:21.787 --> 40:25.922
  FROM WHAT YOUR SISTER SAYS,
    YOU'RE NOT MOST PEOPLE.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.124
       WELL, MARTHA NEEDS
         TO LEARN HER
      FUCKING MOUTH SHUT.

40:28.126 --> 40:29.826
          WHOA! WHOA!

40:29.828 --> 40:31.161
           LANGUAGE.

40:32.463 --> 40:35.532
             LOOK,
  I KNOW IT CAN BE DIFFICULT,

40:35.534 --> 40:39.569
         BUT, YOU KNOW,
 YOUR SISTER'S PULLING FOR YOU.

40:39.571 --> 40:40.770
      SHE'S A GOOD PERSON.

40:40.772 --> 40:41.938
        HOW DO YOU KNOW?

40:41.940 --> 40:43.540
       SHE HELPED ME QUIT
         SMOKING WEED.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.608
        IT DOESN'T LOOK
   LIKE SHE WAS VERY HELPFUL.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.013
      I USED TO SMOKE WEED
       LIKE ALL THE TIME.

40:50.015 --> 40:51.181
 I NEVER GET ANY WRITING DONE.

40:51.183 --> 40:54.083
        NOW I JUST SMOKE
     BEFORE AND AFTER WORK,

40:54.085 --> 40:56.085
     AND I GET STUFF DONE.

40:56.087 --> 41:00.023
      IN REHAB WE HAD MORE
 OF AN ALL-OR-NOTHING APPROACH

41:00.025 --> 41:03.226
       WITH A LITTLE BIT
        OF HIGHER POWERS

41:03.228 --> 41:06.162
       SURRENDER YOURSELF
     BULLSHIT PEPPERED IN.

41:06.164 --> 41:07.764
         DOES IT WORK?

41:07.766 --> 41:09.799
   IT SEEMS TO IF YOU BELIEVE
      YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

41:12.570 --> 41:14.604
     SO WHAT DO YOU WRITE?

41:15.773 --> 41:19.108
      UH...I WRITE POETRY.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.044
            REALLY?

41:21.046 --> 41:23.513
  SO YOU'RE ALL DEEP AND SHIT?

41:23.515 --> 41:25.782
      I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.

41:25.784 --> 41:28.785
     WELL, LET'S HEAR ONE.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.053
            FRESNO.

41:30.055 --> 41:31.688
    I DON'T LIKE IT ALREADY.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.893
            FRESNO.

41:36.895 --> 41:40.163
    LORD, WHY IS IT SO HOT?

41:40.165 --> 41:42.131
      DID YOU MEAN FOR IT
        TO BE THIS HOT?

41:42.133 --> 41:44.834
   OR DID YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE
     IN A HURRY AND FRESNO

41:44.836 --> 41:47.036
    WAS THE OVEN YOU FORGET
          TO TURN OFF?

41:47.038 --> 41:48.538
            FRESNO.

41:48.540 --> 41:51.140
YES, THAT SMELL IS DEAD ANIMAL.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.276
        DO YOU LIKE IT?

41:53.278 --> 41:54.944
            FRESNO.

41:54.946 --> 41:59.082
        WHERE IS STUFF,
        LIKE, ANYTHING?

41:59.084 --> 42:03.520
   FRESNO, WHERE THE BEST JOB
  I COULD GET IS THE WORSE JOB

42:03.522 --> 42:05.121
         I'VE EVER HAD.

42:05.123 --> 42:08.057
   NO, HOTEL GUEST, I CANNOT
  TELL YOU WHERE ANYTHING IS.

42:08.059 --> 42:13.229
IF KNEW WHERE ANYTHING ELSE WAS,
         I'D BE THERE.

42:13.231 --> 42:15.131
            FRESNO.

42:22.239 --> 42:25.909
            COME ON!

42:25.911 --> 42:28.578
        COME ON, MARTHA.
     MY DEAD GRANDMA COULD
     KICK HARDER THAN YOU.

42:36.854 --> 42:37.887
          THERE WE GO!

42:37.889 --> 42:39.789
            COME ON!

42:42.593 --> 42:47.130
         SO, LIKE SANDS
     THROUGH THE HOURGLASS,

42:47.132 --> 42:50.567
 SO ARE THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES.

42:50.569 --> 42:52.302
       THAT'S PLAGIARISM.

42:52.304 --> 42:53.636
    I LITERALLY WROTE THAT.

42:53.638 --> 42:54.971
          WHETHER YOU
       BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

42:54.973 --> 42:56.873
         - I THINK SO.
       - THAT'S SO LAME.

42:56.875 --> 42:58.141
       THAT'S PARTIALLY.

42:58.143 --> 43:00.043
     I THINK YOU DON'T KNOW
       ENOUGH ABOUT PROSE

43:00.045 --> 43:01.811
       TO REALLY GIVE ME
     AN ACCURATE CRITIQUE.

43:01.813 --> 43:03.313
   I KNOW ABOUT PROS. I KNOW
  ABOUT PRO BASEBALL PLAYERS.

43:03.315 --> 43:05.949
  I KNOW ABOUT PRO BASKETBALL
    PLAYERS. I KNOW ABOUT--

43:05.951 --> 43:08.651
    I'M OFF WORK, LIKE NOW.

43:08.653 --> 43:11.287
          DO YOU WANT
      TO GO DO SOMETHING?

43:11.289 --> 43:12.755
             I DO.

43:12.757 --> 43:14.157
OKAY, EVERYONE
          IN A CIRCLE.

43:14.159 --> 43:16.693
      YES. FASTER, FASTER,
        FASTER, FASTER!

43:22.266 --> 43:24.968
  KRAV MAGA. WE HAVE ONE RULE,
         ONE RULE ONLY.

43:24.970 --> 43:26.803
      NEVER STOP FIGHTING!

43:33.277 --> 43:35.011
- HIYAH.
- HIYAH.

43:35.013 --> 43:39.849
   THANK YOU. BRYAN EMAIL ME,
   WEDNESDAY ABOUT PRIVATES.

43:39.851 --> 43:41.351

43:41.353 --> 43:43.252
            - OKAY.
            - COOL.

43:44.888 --> 43:46.823
HOW LONG HAS ALICIA
      BEEN WITH THAT DUDE?

43:46.825 --> 43:47.991
         I DON'T KNOW.

43:47.993 --> 43:51.127
  I DON'T REALLY TALK TO THEM.

43:51.129 --> 43:52.762
          YOU WERE AT
      THAT SOFTBALL THING.

43:52.764 --> 43:54.263
     OH YEAH. OH, I DIDN'T
       WANT TO INTERRUPT.

43:54.265 --> 43:56.099

43:56.101 --> 43:59.235
             YEAH.

         EVEN INVITED.

44:10.915 --> 44:12.715
        WELL, LUCKY YOU.

44:12.717 --> 44:17.654
     NOAH'S PARENTS PAY FOR
   PRIVATES SO I HAVE TO GO.

44:17.656 --> 44:19.288
      AND YOU HAVE TO COME
            WITH ME.

44:19.290 --> 44:21.224
    LIKE AS YOUR FAKE DATE?

44:21.226 --> 44:23.926
      NO, AS A REAL DATE.

44:23.928 --> 44:25.828
         IS THAT A YES?

44:30.034 --> 44:31.367
          WHOA! WHOA.

44:34.806 --> 44:36.305
           - LET'S--
    - LET'S GO TO THE DESK.

44:36.307 --> 44:38.374
  NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

44:38.376 --> 44:40.143
     CAN WE JUST SLOW DOWN
         A LITTLE BIT.

44:40.145 --> 44:42.378
            - WHAT?

           LIKE THAT.

50:55.386 --> 50:57.086
    IT'S REALLY RUDE, NOAH.

50:57.088 --> 50:59.288
 DO YOU THINK YOU GUYS CAN MAKE
  OUT ON MY NEXT MUSIC VIDEO?

50:59.290 --> 51:02.458
     GOOGLE GLORIA STEINEM
        AND THEN ASK US.

51:02.460 --> 51:04.326
        SO HOW LONG WILL
       THESE THINGS LAST?

51:04.328 --> 51:06.796
        ABOUT AS LONG AS
 A WEDDING RECEPTION, YOU KNOW.

51:06.798 --> 51:08.697
           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.

51:08.699 --> 51:10.232
      I DON'T REALLY KNOW
        HOW LONG THAT IS

51:10.234 --> 51:11.634
    BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN

           - OR Y.A.

53:06.250 --> 53:07.449
         I THINK WE DO.
    IT'S A PART OF THE DEAL.

53:07.451 --> 53:08.851
        - I DON'T DANCE.
           - COME ON.

53:08.853 --> 53:10.953

53:15.626 --> 53:17.660
           ALL RIGHT.
   BRING IT IN. BRING IT IN.

53:26.836 --> 53:29.672
  YOU HAVE A REALLY CUTE ASS.

53:29.674 --> 53:31.373
       IT'S DISTRACTING.

53:31.375 --> 53:35.611
   STOP. IT'S A BAR MITZVAH.
      THERE'S KIDS AROUND.

53:35.613 --> 53:38.547
          I'M SERIOUS.
       IT'S DISTRACTING.

53:38.549 --> 53:39.782
            MY ASS?

53:39.784 --> 53:42.618
             - YES.
          - OH, SURE.

53:42.620 --> 53:44.987
      IT'S 'CAUSE YOU WORK
        ME OUT SO GOOD.

54:00.303 --> 54:03.539
           HEY, MAYBE
         WE SHOULD TAKE
          A BREATHER.

54:03.541 --> 54:05.708
            - OKAY.
  - GET A DRINK OR SOMETHING?

54:09.479 --> 54:11.647
        I'M GOING TO USE
        THE LADIES ROOM.
       DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

54:11.649 --> 54:12.681
             UH-UH.

54:13.817 --> 54:15.651
   I, LIKE, REALLY LIKE YOU.

54:18.355 --> 54:20.022
  AND SINCE YOU WON'T TELL ME

54:20.024 --> 54:21.390
  WHY YOU'RE BEING BLACKMAILED
     I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR

54:21.392 --> 54:23.292
       I GET TO DO THIS.

54:35.405 --> 54:38.007
EXCUSE ME.
       IT'S TIME TO STRAP
        ON THE FEEDBAGS.

54:38.009 --> 54:39.975
         DINNER WILL BE
     IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES

54:39.977 --> 54:43.545
 IF OUR VERY EXPENSIVE CATERING
COMPANY WOULD JUST DO THEIR JOB.

54:44.547 --> 54:46.482
           GOOD LUCK.

54:50.553 --> 54:52.988
         OKAY, ALRIGHT.
             READY?

54:52.990 --> 54:54.857

       SO, YOU GUYS LOOK
     PRETTY CUTE TOGETHER.

54:59.797 --> 55:01.930
   YESTERDAY, YOU WERE PISSED
  BECAUSE I WAS ALONE WITH HIM

55:01.932 --> 55:03.032
        AND NOW YOU WANT
       US TO GET MARRIED.

55:03.034 --> 55:04.366
           NO, SHAN,

55:07.338 --> 55:10.572
        I KNOW. I THINK
     I SHOULD JUST FUCK HIM
     AND GET IT OVER WITH.

55:10.574 --> 55:12.541
        WILL YOU NOT SAY
       THAT KIND OF SHIT
         ALL THE TIME?

        THERE'S PEANUTS
         IN EVERYTHING.

56:56.614 --> 56:58.480
    GIVE IT UP FOR THIS GUY.
      THIS GUY IS A HERO.

56:58.482 --> 57:00.015

      YEAH, I THINK I AM.
         IT WAS JUST A
       SEIZURE, I GUESS.

57:14.665 --> 57:18.534
    OKAY. I THINK WE SHOULD
    JUST GO BACK TO MY PLACE

57:18.536 --> 57:19.768
  SO I CAN KEEP AN EYE ON YOU.

57:19.770 --> 57:20.869
        HOW ABOUT THAT?

57:20.871 --> 57:22.638
 OH GOSH. I DON'T KNOW, KELLY.

57:22.640 --> 57:25.140
   I THINK I SHOULD PROBABLY
       JUST GO HOME ALONE

57:25.142 --> 57:27.976
       'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
       I NEARLY JUST DIED
          KIND OF SO.

57:27.978 --> 57:29.745
       OKAY. WHAT IS IT?

    DO YOU NOT LIKE HANGING
   OUT WITH ME OR SOMETHING?

57:33.484 --> 57:37.619

57:37.621 --> 57:40.589
   MY SISTER IS-- AT MY HOUSE
     SO I HAVE TO BE THERE.

57:40.591 --> 57:42.724
         OKAY. YOU HAVE
         TO STOP USING
       YOUR ADULT SISTER

57:42.726 --> 57:44.059
          AS AN EXCUSE
      FOR BLOWING ME OFF.

57:44.061 --> 57:45.794
    I'M NOT BLOWING YOU OFF.

57:45.796 --> 57:46.929
     I DON'T WANT YOU THINK
      I'M BLOWING YOU OFF.

      IF YOU NOTICED THAT.

57:55.239 --> 57:58.106
       I LIKE YOU A LOT.

57:58.108 --> 58:01.543
     AND I'M COOL AS SHIT,

          AND PRETEND

58:06.250 --> 58:07.950
     LIKE I DON'T LIKE YOU
      AND BE MEAN TO YOU?

58:07.952 --> 58:09.852
   IS THAT WHAT ALICIA DOES?

58:09.854 --> 58:12.788
    SHOULD I BE LIKE ALICIA
   AND FLIRT WITH OTHER GUYS
           IN THE GYM

58:12.790 --> 58:14.022

       SO LET'S DO THIS.

58:19.797 --> 58:21.730
      WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

58:21.732 --> 58:24.266
      I DON'T KNOW, KELLY.

58:24.268 --> 58:26.134
         I DON'T THINK
       IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

58:26.136 --> 58:28.203
       WAIT, WAIT, KELLY!

58:28.205 --> 58:29.771
    HEY, AND YOU KNOW WHAT,

      YOU SHOULD SIGNED UP
          FOR SPINNING

58:31.175 --> 58:33.075
        BECAUSE MY CLASS
HAS A NO ASSHOLE POLICY NOW, SO.

58:49.726 --> 58:51.026
    WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

58:51.028 --> 58:52.928
      NOTHING, I'M SORRY.

58:52.930 --> 58:54.897
  I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WAS HERE
    SO I'M JUST GOING TO GO

58:54.899 --> 58:56.698
      AND YOU CAN CONTINUE
       YOU'RE BLUBBERING.

58:56.700 --> 58:58.834
 - JUST PRETEND I AM NOT HERE.
    - YOU'RE SO INSENSITIVE.

58:58.836 --> 59:00.202
     ARE YOU EVEN A WOMAN?

59:00.204 --> 59:03.906
     HEY, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

59:03.908 --> 59:05.207
        NO, YOU'RE NOT.

59:05.209 --> 59:07.109
      OKAY FINE. I'M NOT!

59:07.111 --> 59:10.045
   I SAW AN "OPRAH" ON THIS.
      YOU'RE A SOCIOPATH.

59:10.047 --> 59:12.581
   HEY WAIT-- NOW LISTEN I AM
      NOT SOCIOPATH, OKAY?

59:12.583 --> 59:13.982
         I FEEL STUFF.

59:13.984 --> 59:15.851
          I EMPATHIZE
  AND I SYMPATHIZE WHICH MEANS

59:15.853 --> 59:17.553
   THAT I'M NOT A SOCIOPATH!

59:17.555 --> 59:19.021
   OKAY, WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE

59:19.023 --> 59:20.656
         THEN WHY DON'T
   YOU ASK ME WHY I'M CRYING?

59:26.162 --> 59:28.330
    ALL RIGHT, I CAN DO IT.

59:28.332 --> 59:30.232
         WHAT'S WRONG?

59:30.234 --> 59:32.968
  OKAY, WELL WHEN I CONFRONTED
       SCOTT ABOUT YOU--

59:32.970 --> 59:34.102
          WHO'S SCOTT?

59:34.104 --> 59:35.804
          MY HUSBAND,
     THE ONE THAT YOU BLEW.

59:35.806 --> 59:38.273
    OH, YES, OKAY. AND SCOTT
   YOU TALKED TO HIM ABOUT...

59:38.275 --> 59:39.808
    YEAH, HE DIDN'T DENY IT.

59:39.810 --> 59:41.176
    HE ADMITTED IT WAS TRUE.

59:41.178 --> 59:42.311
             OKAY.

59:42.313 --> 59:44.046
      AND THEN I ASKED HIM
        IF IT WAS GOOD.

59:44.048 --> 59:46.782
        AND I COULD TELL
      THAT HE DIDN'T WANT
        TO SAY ANYTHING

59:46.784 --> 59:48.884
   BUT I FORCED IT OUT OF HIM

59:48.886 --> 59:54.256
      AND HE SAID THAT IT
      WAS THE BEST BLOWJOB
          OF HIS LIFE.

59:54.258 --> 59:56.091
        AND NOW WE JUST
      CAN'T STOP FIGHTING

59:56.093 --> 59:57.693
      AND I CAN'T HAVE SEX
            WITH HIM

59:57.695 --> 59:59.194
     AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
      WHAT I'M GOING TO DO

59:59.196 --> 01:00:03.966
       BECAUSE I JUST--
         I CAN NEVER--
      I CAN NEVER DO THAT!

01:00:03.968 --> 01:00:05.934
          YEAH, OKAY,
         YOU CAN DO IT,
         YOU CAN DO IT.

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:07.736
         YOU KNOW WHAT,
    I KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS.

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:12.140
        WE'LL USE THIS.

01:00:12.142 --> 01:00:13.942
       I'M GOING TO TEACH
      HOW TO GIVE THE BEST
     BLOWJOB OF YOUR LIFE.

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:16.678
       OKAY, BUT HOLD ON,
        CAN WE USE THIS?

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:22.084
      DOESN'T SURPRISE ME
      PHIL TOOK THE CASH.

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:24.019
     HE WAS IN BUCHENWALD.

01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:25.687
  BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET FREAKY
   WHEN THERE'S A HOLOCAUST.

01:00:25.689 --> 01:00:26.955
       IT WAS A GOOD RUN!

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:29.057
         "SUCKY, SUCKY
       MY BIG FAT COCK!"

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:30.292
         SORRY, HONEY.

01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:32.861
  SO, WHAT DO YOU NORMALLY DO?

01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:37.332
      I JUST CLOSE MY EYES
           AND THEN--

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:39.001
    LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE EATING
          A CORN COB.

01:00:39.003 --> 01:00:40.268
        THAT'S NOT GOING
    TO FEEL GOOD TO ANYONE.

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:42.204
            - OKAY.
            - OKAY.

01:00:42.206 --> 01:00:44.006
       ALL RIGHT SO WHAT
      KIND OF PORN DO YOU
      GUYS WATCH TOGETHER?

01:00:44.008 --> 01:00:45.874
         NO PORN, NONE.

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:47.976
       WATCH A PORN ONCE
     IN A WHILE BY YOURSELF

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:49.745
         AND WATCH HOW
       THE CHICKS DO IT.

01:00:49.747 --> 01:00:51.747
          AREN'T MOST
     OF THOSE WOMEN SLAVES?

01:00:51.749 --> 01:00:53.415
       NO, THEY'RE FINE.

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:55.651
      OH, I THOUGHT I SAW

              NO.

01:00:56.954 --> 01:00:59.287
   NO, THEY PUT THEM IN A BOX
      AND SHIP THEM OVER--

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:00.822
     NO, THAT'S-- NO THOSE
      ARE THE MANICURISTS.

        WHAT DO YOU MEAN
       IT'S ONLY 12,000?

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:10.225
       COME ON, COME ON.
      IT'S A LOT OF MONEY,

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.993
          IT'S LIKE--
    THAT'S LIKE SIX DIGITS.

01:02:11.995 --> 01:02:14.262
    I SAID I WANTED 25,000.

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:17.399
        WELL YOU CAN GET
       A HOUSE IN DETROIT
        FOR, LIKE, $800.

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:19.134
     I DIDN'T WANT A HOUSE!

01:02:19.136 --> 01:02:20.368
      I WANTED A BUILDING.

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:22.304
     COME ON, RUBY, PLEASE?

01:02:22.306 --> 01:02:23.472

            I MEAN

       IT'S A GOOD START,
    GET EVERYTHING ROLLING,
           YOU KNOW?

01:02:28.011 --> 01:02:30.746
IT'S A GREAT START.

01:02:30.748 --> 01:02:32.447
   I'LL SELL THE THUNDERBIRD.

01:02:32.449 --> 01:02:35.217
 - YOU'LL SELL THE THUNDERBIRD?
 - I PROMISE! I DON'T NEED IT.

01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:37.052
          SUPER COOL.

01:02:37.054 --> 01:02:39.287
             OKAY.

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:41.189
    WE'LL TURN THE OVEN ON.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:49.197
      IT WAS REALLY SWEET
        OF YOU TO COME.

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:50.866
           OF COURSE!

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:52.501
   YOU COULD'VE JUST TOLD ME

01:02:52.503 --> 01:02:55.771
    YOU'RE BEING BLACKMAILED
  FOR KILLING SOME GUY'S DOG.

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:59.941
      I FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.
          I STILL DO.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:02.110
      THIS IS MY LAST DOG!

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:05.480
     SUCK MY DICK, FRESNO!

01:03:05.482 --> 01:03:07.849
   WHAT'S UP WITH THAT CHICK?

01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:11.286
  OH, SHE'S MOVING TO DETROIT.

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:14.356
          OKAY. UM...

01:03:14.358 --> 01:03:20.529
         LET'S ALL BOW
       OUR HEADS AND HAVE
      A MOMENT OF SILENCE.

01:03:22.498 --> 01:03:27.035
   BORIS, OH PRECIOUS BORIS.

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:34.009
       HE WAS A CHAMPION
  BUT HE WAS ALSO A DIRTY DOG.

01:03:36.546 --> 01:03:42.350
 OH, GOD, PLEASE WATCH OVER HIM
AND TAKE HIM TO A BETTER PLACE.

01:03:42.352 --> 01:03:45.020
EVERYONE DESERVES THEIR DIGNITY.

01:03:45.022 --> 01:03:48.957
     WE'VE ALL DONE THINGS
      WE'RE NOT PROUD OF.

01:03:48.959 --> 01:03:50.826
         THE LAST TIME
      I WAS AT A CEMETERY

01:03:50.828 --> 01:03:53.295
  WAS FOR MY FATHER'S FUNERAL.

01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:55.297
    IT WAS NOT AN EASY TIME
         FOR ANY OF US

01:03:55.299 --> 01:03:58.400
BUT ESPECIALLY NOT FOR MY SISTER
SHANNON BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T SHOW.

01:03:58.402 --> 01:04:00.135
 I KNOW SHE WANTED TO BE THERE

01:04:00.137 --> 01:04:03.505
    BUT SHE COULDN'T BECAUSE
     SHE DIDN'T FEEL GOOD.

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:05.574
       I DON'T BLAME HER.

01:04:05.576 --> 01:04:08.310
          IT'S JUST--
   SOMETIMES IT'S HARD FOR ME

01:04:08.312 --> 01:04:10.145
  TO DO EVERYTHING ON MY OWN,

01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:12.414
           SO I GUESS
    I'M JUST REALLY GRATEFUL

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:14.316
        THAT WE MADE IT
  THROUGH THIS TIME TOGETHER.

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:18.019
             YEAH.

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:43.211
          HI, MARTHA.

01:04:56.459 --> 01:05:00.061
        MARTHA! MARTHA!

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:04.966
    WE SLEPT TOGETHER BEFORE

01:05:04.968 --> 01:05:06.968
        SO THERE'S LIKE
A GRANDFATHER CLAUSE SITUATION,

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:11.506
    THEY STILL BUILD THESE.
       ISN'T THAT CRAZY?

01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:14.042
         LITTLE SHEDS?

01:05:14.044 --> 01:05:17.412
 MARTHA! MARTHA, STOP RUNNING!

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:19.180
        MARTHA, COME ON!

01:05:19.182 --> 01:05:20.348
        WAIT, I'M SORRY!

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:22.150
 SORRY, YOU'RE NOT SORRY, SHAN!

01:05:22.152 --> 01:05:23.585
       IT'S NOT MY FAULT!

01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:25.420
        IT'S MY DISEASE!
        I CAN'T HELP IT!

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:27.923
       OF COURSE, RIGHT.
         YOU NEVER MEAN
        TO DO ANYTHING.

01:05:27.925 --> 01:05:30.225
 YOU KNOW YOU'RE JUST LIKE DAD.

01:05:30.227 --> 01:05:32.360
   JUST BLAME EVERYONE ELSE.

01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:35.563
     IT'S NEVER YOU, RIGHT?

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:39.367
 WELL, I AM SO TIRED OF TRYING
          TO HELP YOU.

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:44.306
            MARTHA!

01:05:44.308 --> 01:05:46.641
    YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME HERE!

01:05:46.643 --> 01:05:48.176
  DON'T COME BACK TO MY PLACE!

01:05:48.178 --> 01:05:50.078
           I'M DONE!

01:05:56.185 --> 01:05:58.620
     IT'S HARD LETTING GO,
           ISN'T IT?

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:03.224
        IF ONLY POP TART
       COULD'VE SPOKEN UP

01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:06.261
          AND TOLD ME
    WHAT WAS BOTHERING HER.

01:06:06.263 --> 01:06:10.732
     BUT TURTLES CAN'T LET
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING, CAN THEY?

01:06:10.734 --> 01:06:12.634
      ROBOTS CAN'T EITHER.

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:41.463
         BACK SO SOON?

01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:44.265
 STAYING FOR A WHILE THIS TIME.

01:06:44.267 --> 01:06:46.001
       YOU HIT THE LOTTO?

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:48.737
     THIS IS LEFT OVER FROM
       BAR MITZVAH MONEY.

01:06:48.739 --> 01:06:50.672
           GOOD LUCK.

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:53.775
MY MOM DIED OF CANCER
  THEN MY DAD DIED OF ALCOHOL,

01:06:53.777 --> 01:06:55.677
    AND MY LITTLE SISTER HAD
      NO ONE TO HELP HER.

01:06:55.679 --> 01:06:59.748
  AND INSTEAD OF HELPING HER I
JUST BLEW OFF MY DAD'S FUNERAL.

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:06.521
   AND A FEW MONTHS AGO I DID
   SOME REALLY HORRIBLE SHIT

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:12.093
   WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE, AND
 MY SISTER BAILED ME OUT AGAIN.

01:07:12.095 --> 01:07:14.329
   AND SO DID THIS-- THIS GUY

01:07:14.331 --> 01:07:19.634
 THAT I MET WHO'S REALLY NICE,
    AND I REALLY LIKED HIM.

01:07:19.636 --> 01:07:21.703
       INSTEAD OF DEALING
        WITH MY FEELINGS

01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:25.106
      LIKE A MATURE ADULT,
        GROWN UP PERSON,

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:27.342
    I FUCKED A RANDOM DUDE.

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:34.115
       I JUST DON'T WANT
  TO LET ANYONE DOWN ANYMORE.

01:07:34.117 --> 01:07:36.384
          I DON'T WANT
   TO LET MYSELF DOWN ANYMORE

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:38.119
      AND I WANT THIS PART
          OF MY LIFE--

01:07:38.121 --> 01:07:40.288
  THIS WHOLE CHUNK TO BE OVER.

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:42.424
    AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
      BECAUSE I NEED HELP.

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:48.329
     I'M JUST FUCKING TIRED
          OF FUCKING.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:54.135
             FUCK!

01:07:54.137 --> 01:08:00.575
   SORRY, IT WASN'T MY TURN,
           I'M SORRY.

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:03.745
            YOU KNOW
    WHO WOULD'VE LOVED THAT?

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:06.381
             OPRAH.

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:22.250
       I HAVE PAYCHECKS!

01:10:22.252 --> 01:10:23.618
    THIS ONE IS FOR MARTHA.

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.253
          THAT'S YOU?

01:10:25.255 --> 01:10:29.257
    AND THIS IS FOR SHANNON,
        YOUR BIG SISTER.

01:10:29.259 --> 01:10:32.727
      SHE'S GOING TO HAVE
   TO PICK HERS UP. SHE QUIT.

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:34.462
 AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ANYMORE.

01:10:34.464 --> 01:10:36.631
            WHY NOT?

01:10:36.633 --> 01:10:37.799
           LET'S SEE.

01:10:37.801 --> 01:10:39.734
  SHE'S A LIAR, SHE'S SELFISH,

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:42.003
       SHE'S UNGRATEFUL,
         AND SHE CAN'T
     GET HER LIFE TOGETHER.

01:10:42.005 --> 01:10:43.605
   IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY SAD.

01:10:43.607 --> 01:10:44.706
        MY SISTER SUCKS.

01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:46.541
       WHY DOES SHE SUCK?

01:10:46.543 --> 01:10:49.477
 WERE YOU NOT LISTENING, JERRY?
I JUST TOLD YOU THE WHOLE THING.

01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:51.579
    SHE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS!

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:53.014
              WHY?

01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:55.683
     BECAUSE SHE JUST DOES
  WHATEVER THE HELL SHE WANTS,

01:10:55.685 --> 01:11:00.488
      AND SHE DOESN'T CARE
  WHO SHE HURTS ALONG THE WAY.

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:04.392
    I MEAN, I DID EVERYTHING
        I COULD FOR HER.

01:11:04.394 --> 01:11:07.729
      I GOT HER THIS JOB,
   LET HER STAY AT MY PLACE,

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:10.598
 AND IT'S LIKE SHE JUST DIDN'T
      EVEN WANT ANY OF IT.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.768
 WELL, IF SHE DIDN'T WANT HELP,
     WHY DID YOU HELP HER?

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:16.471
         I DON'T KNOW.

01:11:16.473 --> 01:11:18.573
   SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED HELP.

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:24.379
             UH...
     I DON'T NEED ANY HELP.

01:11:24.381 --> 01:11:28.416
    YOU WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT
 YOUR SISTER AND NOT YOURSELF.

01:11:28.418 --> 01:11:30.451
    MY LIFE IS PRETTY SWEET.

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:31.986
        IT'S NOT SWEET.

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:36.291
      YOU LIVE ALL ALONE.
  AND YOU'RE A MAID IN FRESNO.

01:11:36.293 --> 01:11:37.825
       YOU'RE A MAID TOO,
           YOU KNOW.

01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:39.861
      YES, BUT I'M BETTER
          THAN A MAID.

01:11:39.863 --> 01:11:41.763
        EXECUTIVE MAID!

01:11:41.765 --> 01:11:43.998
  AND I HAVE SEXY GIRLFRIEND.

01:11:49.071 --> 01:11:52.340
YEAH,
      CAN YOU JUST, LIKE,
   PUT THEM BACK RIGHT AWAY.

01:11:52.342 --> 01:11:54.542
     'CAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS
      GETTING TANGLED UP.

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:00.648
     KELLY, YOU DON'T HAVE
        TO HIDE FROM ME.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:03.651
   HEY, ALICIA IS WORKING OUT
      AT PRESTOWN CROSSFIT

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:05.987
     SO YOU SHOULD GO SIGN
           UP THERE.

01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:08.623
    I DON'T WANT TO SAY "HI"
           TO ALICIA

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:11.526
   I WANT TO SAY "HI" TO YOU,
             KELLY.

01:12:11.528 --> 01:12:12.694
              HI.

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:23.604
  I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU,
             OKAY?

01:12:23.606 --> 01:12:26.541
           I'M SORRY.

01:12:26.543 --> 01:12:29.010
        I WASN'T MYSELF.

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:32.714
YEAH, JUST A LOT OF WEIRD STUFF
    WAS GOING ON IN MY LIFE.

01:12:32.716 --> 01:12:34.916
      YOU SAY YOUR SISTER
    OR YOUR EX ONE MORE TIME

01:12:34.918 --> 01:12:37.018
    I WILL LITERALLY VOMIT,
           RIGHT NOW.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:39.020
         WELL, I WON'T.

01:12:39.022 --> 01:12:42.023
    OKAY? BECAUSE NEITHER OF
  THEM ARE IN MY LIFE ANYMORE.

01:12:42.025 --> 01:12:43.891
       I MEAN IT'S GOOD!

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:46.361
    LIKE FOR THE FIRST TIME
           IN MY LIFE

01:12:46.363 --> 01:12:47.929
      I'M DOING STUFF JUST
          FOR MYSELF.

01:12:47.931 --> 01:12:50.865
     LIKE, I GOT A PEDICURE
           YESTERDAY

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:55.436
   AND I TOOK A BUBBLE BATH,
           YOU KNOW?

01:12:55.438 --> 01:12:57.004
     WOW, YOU TOOK A BATH.

01:12:57.006 --> 01:12:58.740
             YEAH.

01:12:58.742 --> 01:13:03.678
  AND NOW I'M DOING THIS OTHER
  THING I REALLY WANTED TO DO,

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.580
       TALKING TO A GIRL
  WHO I THINK IS PRETTY COOL.

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:11.452
      I REALLY LIKED YOU.

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:12.653
       I STILL LIKE YOU.

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:17.158
             OKAY.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.994
       BUT IF YOUR SISTER
        AND YOUR EX ARE,

01:13:19.996 --> 01:13:22.563
         LIKE, TOTALLY
       OUT OF THE PICTURE
         FOR REAL THEN

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:24.632
  WHAT ARE YOU POSSIBLY GOING
      TO USE AS AN EXCUSE

01:13:24.634 --> 01:13:26.834
     NOT TO GO OUT WITH ME
            TONIGHT?

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:28.870
            TONIGHT.

01:13:28.872 --> 01:13:30.571
            NOTHING.

01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:34.742
          NEWSFLASH--
         I'M AVAILABLE.

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:37.512
           - REALLY?
          - BIG TIME.

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:48.689
       YO, YO, YO! GURU!

01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:50.691
      DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

01:13:50.693 --> 01:13:52.460
        I THINK YOU HAVE
       THE WRONG PERSON.

01:13:52.462 --> 01:13:54.162
            NO, NO.
     YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME?

01:13:54.164 --> 01:13:56.798
        MY PARENTS HAD A
       HOUSE THAT SMELLED
      LIKE DIRTY DIAPERS?

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.032
     DOES THAT RING A BELL?

01:13:58.034 --> 01:14:00.067
             - NO.
- YOU REMEMBER THIS PRETTY FACE?

01:14:02.704 --> 01:14:04.172
           YEAH, HI!

01:14:04.174 --> 01:14:06.140
 YOU GOT ANYMORE AWESOME WORDS
       OF WISDOM FOR ME?

01:14:06.142 --> 01:14:07.608
          OH, I DON'T.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:10.912
       I'M KIND OF OUT OF
       THE GURU BUSINESS.

01:14:10.914 --> 01:14:12.046
             WHAT?

01:14:12.048 --> 01:14:14.449
          I'M WORKING
      AT FOSTER FARMS NOW.

01:14:14.451 --> 01:14:18.219
 OH WELL THAT'S GOOD FOR FOSTER
    FARMS BUT BAD FOR GURUS.

01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:20.521
   YOU WERE SO GOOD AT THAT!

01:14:20.523 --> 01:14:22.190
       I GOT TO TELL YOU
     MY WHOLE LIFE CHANGED

01:14:22.192 --> 01:14:23.658
      BECAUSE OF THE STUFF
          YOU TOLD ME.

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:25.059
          REALLY, HOW?

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:26.627
        I SOLD THE VAN.

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:28.896
       I'M PAWNED BORIS'
         BRONZE MEDAL.

01:14:28.898 --> 01:14:31.199
    I SOLD MY PARENTS' HOUSE
    FOR A SHITLOAD OF MONEY.

01:14:31.201 --> 01:14:32.633
      I FIGURED THEY'D BE
       BETTER OFF ROTTING

01:14:32.635 --> 01:14:34.001
      IN THE NURSING HOME,
           YOU KNOW.

01:14:34.003 --> 01:14:35.570
     GOT A REAL GOOD PRICE
       ON A NURSING HOME,

01:14:35.572 --> 01:14:37.605
   ONE OF THE CHEAPEST ONES.

01:14:37.607 --> 01:14:40.575
      AND THAT WAS REALLY
      ALL BECAUSE OF YOU,
      I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

01:14:40.577 --> 01:14:42.910
        AND I'M GETTING
        A CHIN IMPLANT.

01:14:42.912 --> 01:14:45.112
          I NEVER SAID
       ANY OF THAT STUFF.

01:14:45.114 --> 01:14:48.049
         LISTEN, GURU,
        I FELT YOUR VIBE
       AND I RAN WITH IT.

01:14:48.051 --> 01:14:49.984
     IF YOU EVER SEE BORIS
          YOU TELL HIM

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:52.119
        WE'RE BETTER OFF
   WITHOUT EACH OTHER, OKAY?

01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:54.622
    SIBLINGS CAN REALLY SINK
     EACH OTHER, YOU KNOW?

01:14:54.624 --> 01:14:57.792
     TELL HIM I SAID THAT,
             OKAY?

01:14:57.794 --> 01:15:00.495
     TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF!
            NAMASTE!

01:16:33.822 --> 01:16:36.157
<i> 911, WHAT'S</i>
        <i> YOUR EMERGENCY?</i>

01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:40.628
 IT'S NOT REALLY AN EMERGENCY.

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:44.966
        I KILLED A GUY,
       SO SOMEONE SHOULD
   PROBABLY COME AND GET ME.

01:16:44.968 --> 01:16:47.935
         <i> PLEASE HOLD.</i>

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:50.304
     <i> NOW, I'LL CONNECT YOU</i>
     <i> TO THE FRESNO POLICE.</i>

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:52.340

        <i> PARAMEDICS HAVE</i>
       <i> BEEN DISPATCHED.</i>

01:16:55.278 --> 01:16:58.045
       NO, YOU DON'T HAVE
    TO SEND THE PARAMEDICS.

01:16:58.047 --> 01:17:00.681
   IT WAS A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

01:17:00.683 --> 01:17:02.783
      IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:06.787
  I'M SURE EVERYONE SAYS THAT,
      BUT IT, LIKE REALLY
        WAS AN ACCIDENT.

01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:08.656
       WELL, DO YOU THINK
    THAT MAYBE SOMEONE COULD

01:17:08.658 --> 01:17:10.825
   JUST COME HERE AND GET ME
  BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A CAR?

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:14.829
   THAT'S A REALLY FAR WALK.

01:17:21.703 --> 01:17:24.739
<i> SO ANYWAY, SHAN, I'M</i>
<i>GLAD YOU'RE GETTING MY LETTERS.</i>

01:17:24.741 --> 01:17:27.008
<i>I MISS YOU BUT I'M KIND OF GLAD</i>
        <i> YOU'RE IN JAIL.</i>

01:17:27.010 --> 01:17:29.010
          <i> AND I MEAN</i>
    <i> THAT IN THE NICEST WAY.</i>

01:17:29.012 --> 01:17:31.112
        <i> YOU BETTER LOOK</i>
  <i> LIKE LINDA HAMILTON IN "T2"</i>

01:17:31.114 --> 01:17:33.881
       <i> WHEN YOU GET OUT.</i>
        <i> BABY GOT BACK!</i>

01:17:33.883 --> 01:17:36.017
       <i> LIKE ACTUAL BACK,</i>
        <i> IT WAS AWESOME!</i>

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:41.055
<i>I'LL SEE YOU NEXT MONTH AND TRY</i>
   <i> AND STAY OUT OF TROUBLE.</i>

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:44.892
             <i> HUGS.</i>

01:17:44.894 --> 01:17:48.229
<i> MARTHA.</i>

01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:54.101
       <i> P.S., I HATE YOU</i>
   <i> WHICH IN CASE YOU FORGOT</i>

01:17:54.103 --> 01:17:56.704
<i>MEANS I LOVE YOU LIKE A SISTER.</i>

01:18:24.467 --> 01:18:28.069
   I DID LEARN THIS THIS FROM
       "HOT KNOCKERS 4."

01:18:28.071 --> 01:18:29.437
           OH, BABY.

01:18:29.439 --> 01:18:31.772
          SHAN! STOP,
        YOUR MY SISTER.

        OF DICK SUCKING,

01:18:38.314 --> 01:18:39.346
        AND I MEAN THAT.

01:18:39.348 --> 01:18:41.849
 IT WAS JUST A BIG URINE CAKE.

01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:50.157
IT'S TRUE.
     - I GOT IT! I GOT IT!

01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:53.027

 I WAS JUST A BIG URINAL CAKE.

01:18:53.029 --> 01:18:58.399
     THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY--
           I'M SORRY.

01:18:58.401 --> 01:19:00.267
     EVERYONE'S EXCITED BUT
