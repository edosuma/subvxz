WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:04.172
Whoo!

00:04.205 --> 00:05.406
* Here we go

00:05.439 --> 00:08.776
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:11.779 --> 00:13.247
What's this?

00:14.782 --> 00:17.218
Oh, that's for
Susan Banthony's birthday.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.552
She got women
the right to vote

00:18.586 --> 00:20.654
and invented
that dollar coin nobody uses.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.356
You found
my head yet?

00:22.390 --> 00:23.557
Still looking.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.161
(gasps)
Jimmy,

00:27.195 --> 00:28.729
what are you
doing here?

00:28.762 --> 00:31.699
With Hope? Unannounced.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.101
(whispering):
Three days before Arbor Day.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.604
Oh, my God, are we doing it?

00:36.637 --> 00:38.539
Doing what? Why is he hiding
behind the couch?

00:38.572 --> 00:41.209
Uh, Maw Maw, why don't you take
Hope back into your room?

00:41.242 --> 00:43.077
Now, hang on. Let's make sure
she's lucid first.

00:43.111 --> 00:45.546
This morning she tried to make
a long distance call
with a stapler.

00:45.579 --> 00:48.449
Maw Maw, what day
of the week is it?
What town do we live in?

00:48.482 --> 00:51.085
What's the secret ingredient in
your pineapple upside-down cake?

00:51.119 --> 00:54.188
Tuesday, Natesville, and that
secret dies with me, bitch.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.124
She's good to go--
have fun, honey.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.465
So, do you think that Hope's
old enough for it?

01:04.498 --> 01:06.434
We started with you
when you were little.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.702
Time-out-- what are
you talking about?

01:08.736 --> 01:10.871
Well, only the most magical day
of the year.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.106
Arbor Day.

01:13.307 --> 01:14.442
You guys celebrate Arbor Day?

01:14.475 --> 01:16.144
Yeah, and this
is my costume.

01:16.177 --> 01:19.280
I'm the mystical gift-giving
wizard of the forest.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.249
- Papa Woody.
- (laughs)

01:21.282 --> 01:23.617
- I came up with the name.
- We thought it was hilarious.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.753
- Jimmy never got it.
- Got what?

01:25.786 --> 01:27.455
Papa Woody, the famous spirit

01:27.488 --> 01:29.223
of the forest who pitches
his tent deep in the bush.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.125
(both chuckling)

01:31.159 --> 01:32.626
Still don't understand
what's so funny.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.662
But as a kid,
nothing made me happier

01:34.695 --> 01:36.464
than seeing my dad Papa Woody.

01:36.497 --> 01:39.300
(laughter)

01:39.333 --> 01:42.270
Okay, why do you guys
celebrate Arbor Day?

01:42.303 --> 01:44.505
When Jimmy was a kid, we
celebrated all the holidays.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.240
Not just the big ones.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.776
Presidents' Day was
 always a fun one.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.145
We'd dress as dead presidents
 and wake Jimmy up

01:51.179 --> 01:52.846
with a shower
 of chocolate coins.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.686
We now crown you King
of Presidents' Day.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.190
Long live the king.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.295
VIRGINIA:
 And then we would kick back,
 watch our favorite show--

02:08.329 --> 02:10.264
Beverly Hills 90210--

02:10.298 --> 02:12.333
and eat
 our Presidents' Day meal.

02:12.366 --> 02:16.204
LBJ sandwiches--
 lettuce, butter and jelly.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.806
And then to cap off the day,
 Burt would sing

02:18.839 --> 02:21.475
a special song he had written
 just for the occasion.

02:21.509 --> 02:24.712
* Presidents' Day
was so much fun *

02:24.745 --> 02:27.715
* Started with
George Washington *

02:27.748 --> 02:29.850
* Jimmy got a special treat

02:29.883 --> 02:33.821
* 'Cause freeing
the slaves was really sweet. *

02:33.854 --> 02:35.789
Presidents' Day was awesome.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.226
VIRGINIA:
 Another favorite was
 Groundhog Day.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.328
But since there were no
 groundhogs left in Natesville

02:40.361 --> 02:43.197
after the chemical spill, we
 just dug holes in the backyard

02:43.231 --> 02:45.333
and filled them with treats
 for Jimmy to find.

02:50.438 --> 02:53.207
The groundhog left something
for you, too, Daddy.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.746
VIRGINIA:
 And then we would relax
 and watch 90210

02:58.779 --> 03:00.548
and eat our special
 Groundhog Day meal.

03:03.351 --> 03:06.220
Six more weeks of wieners.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.822
And then to finish the
 celebration, Burt would sing

03:08.856 --> 03:11.392
a special song he had written
 just for the occasion.

03:11.425 --> 03:14.562
* Groundhog Day was really fun

03:14.595 --> 03:17.231
* Rodent looking

03:17.265 --> 03:19.400
* For the sun

03:19.433 --> 03:22.403
* When his shadow did appear

03:22.436 --> 03:26.374
* You got chocolate,
I got beer. *

03:26.407 --> 03:29.543
Groundhog's Day was awesome.

03:29.577 --> 03:32.246
VIRGINIA:
 On Arbor Day, we'd fill
 the living room

03:32.280 --> 03:34.282
with real live little trees

03:34.315 --> 03:36.250
and hang treats for Jimmy
 from the branches.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.286
Burt would wear
 his Arbor Day costume

03:38.319 --> 03:40.921
and Jimmy had
 no idea it was him.

03:40.954 --> 03:44.392
Thanks, Papa Woody,
I wish you were my dad.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.927
Well, I'm sure he wishes you
were good at throwing footballs

03:46.960 --> 03:48.396
or eating with
your mouth closed.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.763
Okay, Papa Woody.

03:49.797 --> 03:52.400
Happy Arbor Day.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.435
Tree you next year.

03:54.468 --> 03:57.871
Tree you next year!

03:57.905 --> 04:00.274
VIRGINIA:
 And as part of our perfect day,

04:00.308 --> 04:02.410
we watched the perfect TV show.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.044
90210.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.647
And ate our traditional
 Arbor Day meal--

04:06.680 --> 04:08.782
warm maple syrup soup.

04:08.816 --> 04:11.452
(all slurping)

04:11.485 --> 04:13.387
And then to finish the holiday,
 Burt would sing

04:13.421 --> 04:16.457
a special song he had written
 just for the occasion.

04:16.490 --> 04:19.360
* Arbor Day was really fun

04:19.392 --> 04:22.763
* Presents grew for everyone

04:22.796 --> 04:25.933
* Give great thanks
to Papa Woody *

04:25.966 --> 04:28.602
* You're the happiest boy
in the neighborhood-y. *

04:28.636 --> 04:31.805
Arbor Day was awesome.

04:31.839 --> 04:36.344
Okay, so I get the gifts
and the songs and the costumes.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.412
But what was the deal
with Beverly Hills 90210?

04:38.446 --> 04:41.482
Oh, a lady I cleaned for gave us
the whole second season on VHS.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.384
We got hooked
immediately.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.453
Moody Dylan,
sweet Brandon,

04:45.486 --> 04:47.355
smoking Brenda.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.390
We didn't want to celebrate
a holiday without 'em.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.624
Arbor Day was my favorite.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.025
All year long,
I'd ask for stuff.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.995
Candy, toys, beef jerky,
and Mom and Dad said,

04:55.028 --> 04:56.497
"Those things
don't grow on trees."

04:56.530 --> 04:59.967
But on Arbor Day, they did.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.436
That is such a sweet tradition,
I love that.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.637
Count me in.

05:03.671 --> 05:06.106
So, where
do you guys plant

05:06.139 --> 05:08.376
- the little baby trees
afterward?
- Oh, we don't plant 'em.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.010
We take 'em out back till
they're dried out enough

05:10.043 --> 05:11.445
for the Chinese
New Year bonfire.

05:11.479 --> 05:15.616
* Chinese New Year
is really fun *

05:15.649 --> 05:18.519
* Dancing dragons,
egg foo yong *

05:18.552 --> 05:20.954
* Up above the Great Wall high

05:20.988 --> 05:23.524
* Like a chopstick
in the sky... *

05:23.557 --> 05:26.527
Chinese New Year's awesome.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.962
* Yeah.

05:28.996 --> 05:32.566
So, you're telling me that
you burn trees on Arbor Day?

05:32.600 --> 05:36.404
No, we pull them out
of the ground on Arbor Day.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.738
They're still
green and alive.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.072
We got to wait
till they're dead

05:39.106 --> 05:40.674
and dried out
before we torch 'em.

05:40.708 --> 05:41.842
God, you're such
a Brenda sometimes.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.677
(both laugh)

05:43.711 --> 05:45.513
In the spirit of Arbor Day Eve,

05:45.546 --> 05:47.381
we wait for the right moment
 and then sneak over

05:47.415 --> 05:49.450
to Porter Street Park and
 grab up some little saplings

05:49.483 --> 05:51.118
for our holiday.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.422
(grunts)

05:54.455 --> 05:56.557
Oh, my God, it was you.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.559
You were the ones
that dug them up.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.428
Dug them up? They
practically fell over.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.929
Yeah, you could
rip 'em right out.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.564
It was like a bunch
of kids planted 'em.

06:03.597 --> 06:06.434
Yeah, I was one of those kids.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.536
Every year for Arbor Day,
 my scout troop would go

06:08.569 --> 06:10.404
to that park
 and plant saplings.

06:10.438 --> 06:13.006
(speaking with lisp):
Someday you'll be 600 feet tall.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.909
You'll provide shade,
oxygen, and a place

06:15.943 --> 06:19.547
for homeless people to go
to the bathroom.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.948
The next day I made
 the driver go out of our way

06:20.981 --> 06:23.484
so I could show my parents
 what I planted.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.487
Mommy, Daddy,
my tree's coming up.

06:33.126 --> 06:36.630
It's gone, my tree's gone.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.532
Why?

06:41.602 --> 06:43.904
You people don't
respect Arbor Day.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.473
You defile it.

06:45.506 --> 06:46.974
(speaking with lisp):
How could you do this?

06:47.007 --> 06:48.542
Oh, my God,
I'm getting so upset,

06:48.576 --> 06:49.777
my lisp is coming back.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.645
You people are monsters!

06:53.514 --> 06:54.782
Did she say we were

06:54.815 --> 06:58.051
mobsters?
I think
she said "monsters."

06:58.085 --> 07:00.888
Well, she is definitely missing
the spirit of Arbor Day.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.791
- Uh...
- (grunts)

07:03.824 --> 07:06.927
I taught her about death. She's
not taking it too well.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.497
You guys deal with it.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.610
What are you doing
in the freezer?

07:22.643 --> 07:24.845
Uh, just chillin'.

07:24.878 --> 07:29.049
(laughing)

07:37.791 --> 07:39.660
Oh, thank God.
(sighs)

07:39.693 --> 07:40.828
I've been in here 40 minutes
waiting for someone

07:40.861 --> 07:42.596
to laugh at that.

07:42.630 --> 07:45.533
I think I might lose my pinky
toe, but it was worth it.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.267
I've get your special order--
I'll meet you up front.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.638
(laughing)

07:50.671 --> 07:55.676
Oh. Well, if it isn't
the human equivalent
of root rot.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.778
Sabrina, as a landscaper,
if you really wanted
to hit us where it hurt,

07:57.811 --> 08:00.147
you'd have called us
aspen canker fungus.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.683
(sighs)
Here we go.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.653
Five gallons of the finest
Grade C, non-organic maple syrup

08:05.686 --> 08:07.655
ever imported
from South America.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.657
Nothing like a belly full
of warm maple syrup soup

08:09.690 --> 08:11.992
when you're getting ready for
the great pulling of the trees.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.627
Must take a lot of syrup

08:13.661 --> 08:15.596
to sugarcoat the murdering
of all those trees.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.298
Oh, come on.
You don't hear anyone whining

08:18.331 --> 08:20.601
about the trees at Christmas
when the whole world

08:20.634 --> 08:22.870
chops 'em down and drags 'em
into their living room.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.973
Because that's a tradition, not
some crazy, made-up way
to spend a holiday.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.609
So, uh, you guys are just here
for the syrup then? Yeah?

08:28.642 --> 08:31.311
That's what traditions are--
they're all made-up, they're all
crazy.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.714
What's a bunny have
to do with Easter?

08:33.746 --> 08:36.249
What's a fat baby angel
with a bow and arrow have
to do with getting a woman

08:36.283 --> 08:38.719
some silk panties
on Valentine's Day?

08:38.751 --> 08:41.054
Would you folks like some
help getting this syrup out to
your car, then?

08:41.087 --> 08:42.990
We got it, Jimmy.
Just make sure you have Hope

08:43.023 --> 08:45.859
at our house at 5 a.m.,
so she can wake up
in the Arbor Day forest.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.696
Look, Hope is not gonna take
part in your tree genocide.

08:48.729 --> 08:51.264
Don't any of you know what
Arbor Day is really all about?

08:51.298 --> 08:53.200
Sure, Sabrina.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.636
I can tell you what Arbor Day
is really all about.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.037
Lights, please.

08:58.906 --> 09:02.643
(upbeat instrumental playing)
In 1854 a young pioneer,

09:02.676 --> 09:04.845
J. Sterling Morton,
moved from Detroit

09:04.878 --> 09:06.947
to the Nebraska Territory.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.750
He and his fellow pioneers
missed their trees,

09:09.783 --> 09:14.755
so on January 4, 1872, Morton
proposed a tree-planting holiday

09:14.788 --> 09:16.624
to be called Arbor Day.
(clattering, grunting)

09:16.657 --> 09:19.292
(music stops)
Everyone, please hold still!
I'm almost done!

09:19.326 --> 09:21.595
(music resumes)
BARNEY:
Over a million trees

09:21.629 --> 09:24.632
were planted in Nebraska
on that first Arbor Day,

09:24.665 --> 09:30.070
and today those tiny saplings
have grown into a grove.

09:30.103 --> 09:33.206
A family of trees, if you will.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.075
(music ends)

09:35.108 --> 09:37.611
That's what Arbor Day
is all about.

09:37.645 --> 09:41.649
And now that the Chance tree
has intertwined branches

09:41.682 --> 09:44.685
with the Collins tree,
perhaps the best idea

09:44.718 --> 09:46.987
is for this tradition
to grow together.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.789
Yes, exactly-- grow,

09:48.822 --> 09:50.791
not destroy. Look,

09:50.824 --> 09:52.926
I'm more than happy to drink
maple syrup soup

09:52.960 --> 09:55.663
and watch 90210,
but I-I just cannot take part

09:55.696 --> 09:58.265
in the senseless execution
of innocent trees.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.167
But the trees
are the most important part

10:00.200 --> 10:02.235
of the whole tradition!
You can't just start
a new tradition

10:02.269 --> 10:04.404
and think it's gonna be as good.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.173
You ever see the Puppy Bowl?

10:06.206 --> 10:07.941
They can't even pick
that ball up.
And if you

10:07.975 --> 10:09.276
don't want to come,
you don't have to.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.078
Just Jimmy and Hope
can come.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.913
SABRINA:
None of us are coming.
We are not exposing

10:12.946 --> 10:14.948
our daughter to your crazy
tree holocaust. Right, Jimmy?

10:14.982 --> 10:17.284
BURT: Jimmy, are you really
turning your back on Papa Woody

10:17.317 --> 10:19.687
and your mama's
warm maple syrup soup?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.855
JIMMY:
 I was forced to choose between
 the traditions of my parents

10:21.889 --> 10:25.659
and the wishes of my wife.

10:25.693 --> 10:30.197
I chose to go with the one
 I share a bed with.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.299
I can't say it was
 as original or as fun

10:32.332 --> 10:36.336
or as exciting
 as my parents' tradition...

10:36.369 --> 10:38.271
...but it was nice to know
 that Hope would grow up

10:38.305 --> 10:39.707
understanding
 the important role

10:39.740 --> 10:41.875
that trees play in our lives.

10:41.909 --> 10:46.880
NARRATOR:
And in the ultimate example
of biological synergy,

10:46.914 --> 10:49.382
our majestic,
bark-covered friends

10:49.416 --> 10:51.685
exhale life-giving oxygen.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.292
JIMMY:
 And that night
 we all slept with visions

10:59.326 --> 11:01.394
of trinket-covered
 saplings dancing in our heads,

11:01.428 --> 11:03.964
we just slept.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.099
Well, most of us slept.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.877
(screaming)

11:16.910 --> 11:18.145
Oh, God!

11:18.178 --> 11:19.212
Who the hell are you?

11:19.246 --> 11:21.014
I'm the Ghost of Arbor Day.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.850
Arbor Day has its own ghost?

11:22.883 --> 11:25.886
No, I also cover Flag Day,
Labor Day, Boxing Day,

11:25.919 --> 11:27.888
Yom Kippur, a whole bunch.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.723
So put on your slippers.
We're going for a walk.

11:29.757 --> 11:32.259
(screams)

11:34.928 --> 11:38.999
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy,
wake up, wake up!

11:39.032 --> 11:41.401
He can't hear you.
It's a dream.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.336
Look, let's get
a move on, okay?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.906
Let's get this legal mumbo jumbo
out of the way first.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.175
I am a ghost.
These are your rights:

11:48.208 --> 11:50.210
you have the right
to continue dreaming.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.880
Also, I cannot touch your
breasts without your permission.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.815
- Do I have your permission?
- No.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.850
Very well, then.
I am here to show you a vision

11:56.884 --> 11:59.719
of Arbor Day past,
present, future.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.958
After you, princess.

12:07.394 --> 12:12.365
This is the Porter Street
playground 20 years ago,

12:12.399 --> 12:14.401
day after Christmas.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.803
Hey, that's me.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.971
And that's my
Suzie So Real doll.

12:18.005 --> 12:19.372
Oh, my God,
I loved her.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.141
Then she got recalled
when they found out

12:21.174 --> 12:22.375
her hair felt so real
'cause it came

12:22.409 --> 12:24.077
from the heads
of Ukrainian orphans.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.146
You know, you can really help
move this thing along

12:26.179 --> 12:28.048
if you keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.384
Anyway, a lot of kids got what
they wanted that year.

12:31.418 --> 12:36.456
But one little boy, he wasn't
so lucky on Christmas.

12:36.489 --> 12:40.527
All he got was a homemade yo-yo
and a hand full of splinters.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.331
Damn it, I really
thought I solved

12:44.364 --> 12:46.834
the "come back up"
problem this year.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.936
Don't beat
yourself up, Burt.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.570
Even if you made
the world's best yo-yo,

12:50.603 --> 12:52.840
it could never compete
with all the expensive toys

12:52.873 --> 12:53.841
these other kids have.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.811
Ha-ha, Santa hates you.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.280
(gasps)

13:02.182 --> 13:04.818
Virginia and Burt felt terrible

13:04.852 --> 13:06.954
about how Christmas
went for months.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.989
Except New Year's Eve
and St. Patrick's Day,

13:09.022 --> 13:10.323
then they got pretty drunk.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.959
(chuckles)

13:11.992 --> 13:13.994
But come springtime,
they had an idea.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.607
VIRGINIA:
Look how happy he is.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.176
And the best part is,

13:29.209 --> 13:31.544
no kid in town is going
to be happier on Arbor Day

13:31.578 --> 13:32.846
than our son.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.514
We don't have to stop here.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.349
Cinco de Mayo is right
around the corner.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.351
And there's Presidents' Day,
Flag Day,

13:38.385 --> 13:39.586
Columbus Day.
Yeah.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.224
Wow, that's really sweet.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.626
Yes, it is.

13:46.659 --> 13:50.998
I hope this is not too forward,
but I would love

13:51.031 --> 13:55.568
to see your 9021-oh face.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.473
Maybe later.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.876
Okay, let's go see
what's going on across town.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.482
It was Arbor Day
at your nana's house,

14:09.516 --> 14:11.318
and you were so excited
to tell everyone

14:11.351 --> 14:12.920
about your new trees.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.555
Daddy, Daddy, I planted
six trees all by myself.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.958
I even got an
achievement star.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.227
That sounds like something
your mother would care about.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.429
Try telling her.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.968
Mommy, Mommy,
I'm very proud
of my trees.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.070
I'd love for you
to come see them.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.072
Not now, honey.
Mommy's on the phone.

14:32.105 --> 14:35.275
Yes. Any chance you
found a pocket mirror

14:35.308 --> 14:40.413
and a rolled-up $100
bill in your men's room?

14:40.447 --> 14:42.349
And once the roots take hold,

14:42.382 --> 14:47.220
those trees are going to grow
big and tall just like me.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.257
Sabrina, you better
not be making my drink slowly

14:50.290 --> 14:53.126
just to have some time
to finish your boring story.

14:55.562 --> 14:59.066
Hmm. I remember this room.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.567
I used to stay in here

15:00.600 --> 15:03.703
when my parents were away
on business.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.572
It was kind of lonely,
but the good news was

15:05.605 --> 15:08.108
my parents made so much money,
I could have any toy I wanted.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.043
Don't worry, Suzie.
When I grow up

15:10.077 --> 15:12.980
and have a family, we're gonna
have time for each other.

15:13.013 --> 15:16.383
We're not going to worry
about work or money or anything.

15:16.416 --> 15:20.187
We're only going to worry
about each other.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.591
I am shocked you didn't
become a stripper.

15:24.624 --> 15:28.328
All right, enough with the past.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.097
Let's get back to the present.

15:30.130 --> 15:33.266
I have a date with the Ghost
of Canadian Thanksgiving.

15:33.300 --> 15:37.004
She's a little bit thick,
but she got a sweet face.

15:43.110 --> 15:46.313
This holiday feels kind of
stupid without a kid around.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.448
I know, it's just
not the same

15:48.481 --> 15:50.683
watching Brenda and Dylan
make out without seeing

15:50.717 --> 15:54.487
the confusion and wonder
in a young child's eyes.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.057
(both slurping)

15:57.090 --> 15:59.059
Wow, that's really sad.

15:59.092 --> 16:02.529
Well, what'd you expect?
You ruined their Arbor Day.

16:05.398 --> 16:09.036
You know, they're not the only
ones who are bummed out.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.143
And when the little boy
woke up the next day,

16:16.176 --> 16:19.512
all the things he wanted
were growing on trees.

16:19.546 --> 16:22.315
But remember,

16:22.349 --> 16:24.317
this is only a story,
all right?

16:24.351 --> 16:29.222
It won't really be like
this when you wake up.

16:29.256 --> 16:32.059
(both sigh)

16:34.494 --> 16:37.030
Welcome to Arbor Day future.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.232
Oh, my God, is that Hope?

16:39.266 --> 16:42.035
She's so beautiful.
And look at all

16:42.069 --> 16:45.038
the stuff she has.
Jimmy and I must be
doing really well.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.745
Jimmy's bald?

16:52.779 --> 16:54.814
No, but I looked back

16:54.847 --> 16:57.184
at six generations of photos
to make sure that there was

16:57.217 --> 16:59.719
no baldness in
his family before I
broke up with Wyatt.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.321
It's stress-related.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.056
When you made Jimmy
stop celebrating

17:03.090 --> 17:04.523
all the minor holidays,

17:04.557 --> 17:07.227
he felt pressure
to go overboard on Christmas

17:07.260 --> 17:09.529
so Hope would have things
other kids have.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.731
There's a saying
in the ghost world:

17:11.763 --> 17:13.366
"Behind every bald man

17:13.400 --> 17:16.236
is a ball-busting woman."

17:18.171 --> 17:20.839
Daddy, I was using
that new telescope you gave me

17:20.873 --> 17:22.541
and I discovered a new comet.

17:22.575 --> 17:23.542
Daddy's busy, honey.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.178
Can you tell your mother

17:25.212 --> 17:28.214
I picked up some overtime
at Howdy's East?

17:28.248 --> 17:29.782
(sighs)

17:29.816 --> 17:32.619
SABRINA:
He looks terrible.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.221
I mean, did I
stay with him?

17:34.254 --> 17:36.256
Because, I-I mean,
I take care of myself,

17:36.289 --> 17:37.624
and I expect that my...
Yeah, bup-bup-bup-bup,

17:37.657 --> 17:39.292
wait for it.

17:41.394 --> 17:45.132
My hair!
(gasps)

17:45.165 --> 17:46.866
Since it was your choice
to stop celebrating

17:46.899 --> 17:48.368
the minor holidays,

17:48.401 --> 17:50.103
pressure got to you, too.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.638
Hey, Mommy, I...

17:51.671 --> 17:53.606
No, not now, honey.
Mommy's got to go to work.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.308
(sighs)
All those cool toys you have

17:55.342 --> 17:56.576
don't grow on trees.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.411
Go talk to your robot.

18:00.647 --> 18:03.116
(door opens and closes)

18:04.484 --> 18:05.885
No.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.120
No, but I....

18:10.623 --> 18:13.126
When I grow up
and have a family,

18:13.160 --> 18:15.195
we're gonna have time
for each other.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.763
We're not going
to worry about work

18:16.796 --> 18:18.298
or money or anything.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.733
We're only gonna worry
about each other.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.169
(robotic voice):
Nanny-Bot registering

18:22.202 --> 18:24.204
unacceptable levels of sadness.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.509
Initiating antidepressant cloud.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.318
(gasps)

18:42.322 --> 18:44.157
(grunts)

18:44.191 --> 18:46.426
(siren sounds)

18:46.459 --> 18:48.261
POLICE OFFICER (over speaker):
Put the sapling down

18:48.295 --> 18:50.330
and your hands up.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.335
What the hell
was she doing?

18:55.368 --> 18:57.170
I'm glad we decided
to finish these burgers

18:57.204 --> 18:59.639
before cheering ourselves up
by pulling out saplings.

18:59.672 --> 19:03.176
I know, those cops really
came out of nowhere.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.453
Where have you been?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.188
I mean, I tried
calling your cell phone

19:15.222 --> 19:17.457
and some woman named
Big Laquanda answered.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.326
I was in jail.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.494
I had to trade my
phone for protection.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.463
Thanks again for
bailing me out, guys.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.464
Yeah.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.665
You were in jail?

19:25.698 --> 19:27.634
Relax, I already
asked her.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.636
No group strip searches,

19:29.669 --> 19:31.671
no shower fights,
and the warden looked

19:31.704 --> 19:33.340
nothing like Shannon Tweed.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.475
Cable television lied to us.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.845
I got arrested for ripping
out trees in the park.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.581
I know that sounds crazy,
but I was visited by

19:41.614 --> 19:43.916
the Ghost of Arbor Day,
Past, Present and Future.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.852
Oh, I saw Mr. Magoo like that.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.755
He showed me that I was wrong
about Arbor Day. I...

19:48.788 --> 19:50.757
You guys had a special
family tradition

19:50.790 --> 19:52.559
that I couldn't see
the value in, and...

19:52.592 --> 19:53.926
(sighs)

19:53.960 --> 19:56.296
- I ruined it.
- No, look,

19:56.329 --> 19:58.265
you were right that it was
stupid to rip out trees.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.667
I mean, if it was okay,
you wouldn't have spent

20:00.700 --> 20:02.935
- the night in jail.
- It's true.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.404
If you hadn't have done it,
we were about to,

20:04.437 --> 20:06.005
then we would've been in jail.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.707
With my crappy flip phone,

20:07.740 --> 20:09.242
Big Laquanda would've
had her way with me.

20:09.276 --> 20:10.910
Oh, that is hot.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.012
For Big Laquanda,
I'm gonna picture

20:13.045 --> 20:14.514
a young Tyne Daly.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.516
No, Markie Post.
Suzanne Somers.

20:16.549 --> 20:20.320
Serena Williams...
Serena Williams.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.290
Tree!

20:28.461 --> 20:29.796
When'd you do that?

20:29.829 --> 20:31.431
Hey, who said it was me?

20:31.464 --> 20:33.700
Maybe it was
an Arbor Day miracle.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.402
You grew up
today, Jimmy.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.605
I'm passing my Arbor Day
costume on to you.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.540
You go, Papa Woody.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.041
Papa Woody...

20:42.074 --> 20:43.943
Oh, now I get it.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.412
- (laughter)
- Right?

20:45.445 --> 20:46.479
He's like the dad
of the forest.

20:46.513 --> 20:48.281
(sighs)

20:48.315 --> 20:50.883
When you form
 a family of your own,

20:50.917 --> 20:53.486
sometimes old traditions
 go through a change.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.389
But that doesn't mean
 they're not just as special.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.658
In our new Arbor Day tradition,

20:58.691 --> 21:00.827
we planted trees
 the way Sabrina wanted.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.396
Of course, she didn't
 have a choice...

21:03.430 --> 21:04.564
but the rest of us did.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.433
And we decided to join her.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.967
And celebrating with Hope

21:08.000 --> 21:09.769
turned out to be my
 favorite Arbor Day ever.

21:14.541 --> 21:17.344
We had a lot fun
with saplings tonight.

21:17.377 --> 21:18.978
But we wanted to reassure
everyone in America

21:19.011 --> 21:21.448
that no trees were harmed
in the filming of this episode.

21:21.481 --> 21:24.451
And so, from our family
to yours...

21:24.484 --> 21:27.854
ALL: Happy Arbor Day!
Tree you next week!

21:30.390 --> 21:33.326
Young Girl:
 Thanks, Papa Woody!
