(MEN SCREAMING)

16:06.250 --> 16:08.833
Jean, see if you can locate
Creed in the mansion.

16:12.208 --> 16:15.500
JEAN: Not in the mansion.
Beneath it.

16:15.500 --> 16:19.208
A secret laboratory.
And something else
is in there,

16:19.208 --> 16:21.458
something with incredible power.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.208
(JEAN SCREAMS)

16:23.208 --> 16:24.625
Jean! What is it?

16:24.625 --> 16:27.708
Hurry, Scott,
before it's too late.

16:27.708 --> 16:29.958
Don't worry,
we'll stop them.

16:32.375 --> 16:34.125
Get us down to the lab!

16:34.125 --> 16:35.708
Leave that to me.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.875
I'm sick.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.583
I need help.

16:49.125 --> 16:52.750
I can't be sick now,
with the plague about to spread.

16:52.750 --> 16:56.958
By the time I recover,
it'll be too late
to direct events.

16:56.958 --> 16:58.833
(CREED COUGHING)

17:00.458 --> 17:02.208
CYCLOPS:
Your game's up, Creed.

17:02.208 --> 17:04.083
We're here to put
an end to your plague.

17:06.583 --> 17:08.458
And I'm here to help them!

17:10.083 --> 17:15.458
The name's Cable.
Remember it, Apocalypse!

17:15.458 --> 17:21.458
Your puny weapons can never
prevail against Apocalypse!

17:22.833 --> 17:25.125
Why don't we find out!

17:27.708 --> 17:28.958
A mutant.

17:29.458 --> 17:35.416
I am as far beyond mutants
as they are beyond you.

17:35.875 --> 17:39.000
I am eternal.

17:40.583 --> 17:41.708
(STORM AND GAMBIT GROAN)

17:46.083 --> 17:49.250
You defeated
my four Horsemen once,

17:49.250 --> 17:53.000
but now nothing can stop
the Apocalypse!

17:53.000 --> 17:54.083
(CYCLOPS GROANS)

17:54.083 --> 17:55.208
JEAN: Scott!

17:57.458 --> 18:00.708
Annoying insects!

18:02.500 --> 18:05.333
I cannot be touched.

18:05.333 --> 18:07.958
I cannot be harmed.

18:07.958 --> 18:11.291
Watch me and tremble,

18:13.250 --> 18:20.166
for I bring the purity
of oblivion to your world.

18:20.291 --> 18:21.708
Look out!

18:21.708 --> 18:23.083
No!

18:25.458 --> 18:26.833
Wolverine!

18:28.583 --> 18:31.458
It must be!
It's the only way!

18:32.166 --> 18:33.875
(GROANING)

18:35.000 --> 18:37.333
You've let Apocalypse kill him!

18:37.333 --> 18:40.125
No. I've saved us all.

18:43.125 --> 18:47.000
Wolverine's special mutant
immune system is curing him.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.708
And by doing so,
he's creating the antibodies

18:49.708 --> 18:52.000
that all mutants
will need to survive.

18:53.833 --> 18:58.708
We have the cure now,
Apocalypse!
Your virus is useless!

19:04.375 --> 19:08.708
Remember it, Apocalypse.
The name's Cable.

19:09.416 --> 19:14.458
I shall not forget
this impudence!

19:16.208 --> 19:18.833
CYCLOPS: Get out of here
before the whole thing blows!

19:20.750 --> 19:23.291
CREED: Put me down.

19:23.291 --> 19:26.875
Remember, Mr. Creed,
a mutant saved your life.

19:26.875 --> 19:30.291
My beautiful virus!

19:31.083 --> 19:35.875
The mutant filth
have destroyed everything!

19:43.875 --> 19:46.333
(SCREAMING)

19:51.083 --> 19:52.416
(GRUNTS)

19:52.416 --> 19:54.708
I'm back
in the future again.

19:54.708 --> 19:58.708
Nothing's changed.
It's all just like I left it.

20:00.125 --> 20:01.708
Did we stop the plague?

20:01.708 --> 20:03.375
FORGE: Plague? What plague?

20:05.000 --> 20:06.958
I'll tell you
all about it.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.750
Well, do I get a clean
bill of health?

20:15.333 --> 20:19.250
As usual, Wolverine's
mutant powers have cured him.

20:19.250 --> 20:22.416
But the antibodies they
created to kill the plague

20:22.416 --> 20:25.375
are like none
I've ever seen before.

20:25.375 --> 20:27.291
Curious.

20:27.291 --> 20:30.458
Who knows what a study of them
could lead to in the future.

20:33.708 --> 20:34.833
TYLER: Dad!

20:34.833 --> 20:37.458
Tyler!
You're safe!

20:38.166 --> 20:42.625
Wolverine's antibodies
did preserve the future.
I knew it!

20:52.250 --> 20:55.583
