WEBVTT

00:09.410 --> 00:11.878
Oh, what the hell?

00:15.416 --> 00:16.683
Who-who are you?

00:16.751 --> 00:17.784
Charlie McReddin.

00:17.852 --> 00:19.185
Oh, Charlie McReddin.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.220
Daddy, you found him?

00:20.287 --> 00:21.221
Yeah.

00:21.288 --> 00:22.935
- What are you guys doing?
- We're playing hide-and-seek.

00:23.055 --> 00:24.257
He's great at it.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.587
I'm the best at hide-and-seek.

00:25.707 --> 00:26.266
Oh.

00:26.386 --> 00:28.028
Come on, Charlie, let's go.

00:28.096 --> 00:30.030
Is everything all right?

00:30.098 --> 00:31.064
I thought I heard Ellie scream.

00:31.132 --> 00:31.898
No, that was me.

00:31.966 --> 00:32.732
Whoa.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.668
Well, you didn't see what I saw.

00:33.788 --> 00:36.293
<i>Children of the Corn</i> is hiding
inside of our cabinet over here.

00:36.296 --> 00:37.262
What? He's Ellie's friend.

00:38.331 --> 00:40.682
In fact, I think he
might be her boyfriend.

00:40.767 --> 00:42.100
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:42.168 --> 00:43.268
It's too soon for that.

00:43.336 --> 00:44.269
What?

00:44.337 --> 00:47.055
First, it's hide-and-seek, and
then that turns into doctor,

00:47.140 --> 00:49.224
which leads to seven
minutes in the closet.

00:49.309 --> 00:51.276
You mean seven minutes in heaven?

00:51.344 --> 00:52.277
I never got to heaven.

00:52.345 --> 00:53.278
Oh, I totally did.

00:53.346 --> 00:55.507
That's what I'm talking about,
and then before you know

00:55.514 --> 00:57.699
it, it's gonna be her junior
high graduation and she's gonna

00:57.784 --> 00:58.817
be wearing a Baby Bjorn.

00:58.868 --> 00:59.818
What?

00:59.869 --> 01:01.527
Now, can you tell me how to fix the TV?

01:05.692 --> 01:07.743
Really? You're
really thinking about it?

01:07.827 --> 01:08.744
Yes.

01:08.828 --> 01:10.746
Are you really gonna sell the apartment?

01:10.830 --> 01:12.898
I wasn't thinking about selling
it, but Jenny found me a

01:12.966 --> 01:14.132
buyer, so I have to consider it.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.134
Does he know about Dirty Randy
and the jizz-fest porno?

01:16.202 --> 01:18.003
Do you think I have to disclose that?

01:18.054 --> 01:18.837
Yeah, it's a law.

01:18.905 --> 01:19.771
It's called jizz-closure.

01:19.839 --> 01:20.799
There's no jizz-closure.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.592
If you don't jizz-close, you can
get into a lot of legal trouble.

01:23.676 --> 01:25.143
Look at this guy. Hey!

01:25.211 --> 01:26.311
You-You're blocking me in.

01:26.379 --> 01:27.346
Excuse me? Hello?

01:27.413 --> 01:28.597
Sorry, hi.

01:28.681 --> 01:30.098
Your car is just a little close.

01:30.183 --> 01:32.267
Easy, chemo, I just got it waxed.

01:32.352 --> 01:34.403
Gina? Gina Gibiatti?

01:34.487 --> 01:36.605
It's Andre Nozick from
North Winnetka High.

01:36.689 --> 01:39.191
Yeah, no, I know who you are,
dildo, but if you touch my car,

01:39.242 --> 01:40.192
I'll mace you.

01:40.259 --> 01:41.193
Hey, Gina, it's me.

01:41.244 --> 01:42.194
It's Pete Eckhart.

01:42.245 --> 01:43.195
Yeah.

01:43.246 --> 01:44.279
Good to see you.

01:44.364 --> 01:45.697
Yeah.

01:45.748 --> 01:46.999
You look great.

01:47.066 --> 01:48.533
Yeah, I know.

01:48.584 --> 01:51.753
All right, uh, well, it's been
so long since I've seen you.

01:51.838 --> 01:53.205
I heard you moved to Palm Beach.

01:53.256 --> 01:54.423
Stalk much?

01:54.507 --> 01:55.540
Yeah, I'm back.

01:55.591 --> 01:57.843
Just got a divorce, left that tool.

01:57.910 --> 02:00.379
Later, losers.

02:00.430 --> 02:02.297
Gina Gibiatti.

02:02.382 --> 02:04.516
So hot.

02:04.583 --> 02:05.884
So mean.

02:05.952 --> 02:08.152
How did Frank and her
come from the same parents?

02:08.187 --> 02:11.189
Out of all the Gibiattis, she should
be the one called "The Body."

02:11.257 --> 02:14.359
Yeah, and if you need further proof,
her gynecologist married her.

02:14.427 --> 02:17.145
That guy stares at vagina all day
long, and he chose that one.

02:17.230 --> 02:18.613
Because it's the best.

02:18.698 --> 02:21.066
Yeah, but she divorced him,
and now she is on the waiver

02:21.134 --> 02:23.285
wire, so who's gonna try to pick her up?

02:23.369 --> 02:24.286
No way, man.

02:24.370 --> 02:26.370
That's like picking up
Terrell Owens, too volatile.

02:26.372 --> 02:28.123
I've been thinking about it a little bit.

02:28.207 --> 02:29.124
No.

02:29.208 --> 02:30.826
She made you cry in high school, Pete.

02:30.910 --> 02:31.660
That's true.

02:31.744 --> 02:34.963
You were a senior, she was a freshman,
you asked her privately to the prom, she

02:35.048 --> 02:38.216
brought you into the cafeteria,
publicly said no in front of

02:38.284 --> 02:40.085
everyone, and then you cried.

02:40.136 --> 02:41.336
Yeah, she destroyed me.

02:41.421 --> 02:42.304
I get it.

02:42.388 --> 02:43.555
And now you want to date her?

02:43.623 --> 02:47.342
No, I despise her, but I'm also
extremely attracted to her.

02:47.427 --> 02:50.145
So there's hate, and there's sex.

02:50.229 --> 02:52.931
Oh, you want to hate-her.

02:52.982 --> 02:53.932
You got it.

02:53.983 --> 02:56.651
You see, I woo her, I wine her
and dine her, we have sex,

02:56.736 --> 02:58.854
she's thinking it might be a
good thing, and then I'm like,

02:58.938 --> 02:59.988
bam, "No, you're done."

03:00.073 --> 03:01.022
You're crying now.

03:01.107 --> 03:02.274
"No prom for you. Good-bye."

03:02.325 --> 03:05.610
I don't think you're capable of it, but
I completely support you in doing it.

03:05.661 --> 03:07.779
Good, 'cause I'm gonna need
your help, all of you.

03:07.830 --> 03:08.790
I'll help you out.

03:08.831 --> 03:11.116
If you're having sex with her,
you get tired, just tag me in.

03:11.167 --> 03:12.117
I'll finish her off.

03:12.168 --> 03:14.169
That is not what I'm talking about.

03:14.253 --> 03:16.613
While Pete is attempting to have
delusional revenge-sex with

03:16.622 --> 03:20.125
a woman he despises, I will be
making love to my wife with

03:20.176 --> 03:22.127
the end goal of having an anchor baby.

03:22.178 --> 03:24.963
Well, hopefully it's a girl and
Chalupa Batman can get his

03:25.014 --> 03:26.014
dinged-up little donger wet.

03:26.099 --> 03:29.851
I don't want to think about my children
having sex, especially since Ellie

03:29.936 --> 03:30.852
now has a boyfriend.

03:30.937 --> 03:31.686
Oh.

03:31.771 --> 03:32.521
Really?

03:32.605 --> 03:35.107
This little kid named Charlie who's
always hanging around the house.

03:35.174 --> 03:37.058
You're gonna have to have
the sex talk with her.

03:37.143 --> 03:39.027
I don't want to have the
sex talk with my daughter.

03:39.112 --> 03:39.861
She's eight.

03:39.946 --> 03:42.280
All you have to do is talk
to kids on their level.

03:42.348 --> 03:44.382
Like Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.

03:44.450 --> 03:46.651
Yes, they're boyfriend and
girlfriend, but sometimes Kermit

03:46.719 --> 03:49.404
wants to put his little frog
penis into her pig vagina.

03:49.489 --> 03:50.705
Oh, my God.

03:50.790 --> 03:51.823
Wow.

03:51.891 --> 03:53.058
Don't say pig vagina!

03:53.126 --> 03:55.210
Why? It's important to
use the anatomical term.

03:55.294 --> 03:56.328
Hey.

03:56.379 --> 03:57.329
Hi, Mr. MacArthur.

03:57.396 --> 03:58.330
Oh!

03:58.397 --> 03:59.498
Daddy!

03:59.549 --> 04:01.566
I said no more hide-and-seek.

04:01.634 --> 04:04.219
Oh, come on, Daddy, just
one more round, please?

04:04.303 --> 04:06.338
Fine, one more round, and
then that's it, okay?

04:06.389 --> 04:07.339
Thank you, Daddy.

04:07.406 --> 04:08.340
Hey, Kev?

04:08.407 --> 04:09.341
Yeah?

04:09.392 --> 04:10.552
Andre's dying to talk to you.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.510
Hey, Andre.

04:11.561 --> 04:12.511
Hey, pound it out.

04:12.562 --> 04:13.512
I will not.

04:13.563 --> 04:14.513
Okay.

04:14.564 --> 04:15.514
What's up?

04:15.565 --> 04:17.516
I just wanted to say
thank you to you both.

04:17.567 --> 04:18.950
Jenny found a buyer for my loft.

04:19.017 --> 04:19.951
Oh.

04:20.019 --> 04:20.986
That is my job.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.989
I want to do something amazing for you.
I want to give you guys a gift.

04:24.056 --> 04:24.990
Oh.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.992
I want to take us out to dinner.

04:27.059 --> 04:27.826
With you?

04:27.894 --> 04:28.660
Yeah.

04:28.728 --> 04:29.494
That's the gift?

04:29.562 --> 04:30.328
Yeah.

04:30.396 --> 04:32.280
You don't have to do that, Andre, really.

04:32.365 --> 04:33.448
No, I want to do that.

04:33.533 --> 04:37.269
I can't wait to amuse
this bouche with <i>vou.</i>

04:38.604 --> 04:40.805
<i>Dinner with Andre's not a gift.</i>

04:40.873 --> 04:41.973
<i>No Andre talk.</i>

04:42.041 --> 04:43.291
<i>Losing blood flow.</i>

04:44.510 --> 04:46.044
<i>Oh, my God, that feels good.</i>

04:51.050 --> 04:52.851
<i>Oh, don't stop.</i>

04:52.919 --> 04:55.303
<i>Oh, God, yeah.</i>

04:57.106 --> 04:58.690
<i>No, no, this side.</i>

04:58.757 --> 05:00.609
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

05:00.693 --> 05:01.977
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

05:02.061 --> 05:02.978
<i>Get out!</i>

05:03.062 --> 05:03.995
<i>In!</i>

05:04.063 --> 05:05.280
<i>No, stay out.</i>

05:05.364 --> 05:06.498
<i>Charlie?</i>

05:06.566 --> 05:08.533
<i>Charlie, why were you
hiding in our bedroom?</i>

05:08.601 --> 05:10.535
<i>Because Ellie would
never find me in there.</i>

05:10.603 --> 05:12.654
<i>That's right, she wouldn't
find you in there.</i>

05:12.738 --> 05:15.640
<i>That's why we need you to
forget about everything you</i>

05:15.708 --> 05:17.008
<i>saw up there.</i>

05:17.076 --> 05:18.243
<i>What did I see?</i>

05:18.311 --> 05:19.477
<i>You saw magic.</i>

05:19.545 --> 05:23.548
<i>You saw magic and a real man...
You know what, you saw nothing.</i>

05:23.616 --> 05:24.549
<i>Okay, we're good?</i>

05:24.617 --> 05:25.550
<i>What's in it for me?</i>

05:25.618 --> 05:27.552
<i>What is this, a shakedown, kid?</i>

05:27.620 --> 05:28.420
<i>What could you possibly want?</i>

05:28.487 --> 05:29.254
<i>You're eight years old.</i>

05:29.322 --> 05:31.156
<i>I want to be able to hang
out here with Ellie.</i>

05:31.224 --> 05:31.990
<i>Why?</i>

05:32.058 --> 05:32.859
<i>She's my girlfriend.</i>

05:32.892 --> 05:33.825
<i>No way.</i>

05:33.893 --> 05:36.061
<i>So then I'll just tell Ellie what I saw?</i>

05:36.128 --> 05:37.062
<i>Oh, you're good.</i>

05:37.129 --> 05:39.109
<i>Real good, Charlie.</i>

05:39.229 --> 05:40.865
<i>And you have to help me
with my science project.</i>

05:40.933 --> 05:43.268
<i>My God, you're like a young Tony Soprano.</i>

05:43.319 --> 05:45.604
<i>Fine, I'll help you with your
science project, but full</i>

05:45.655 --> 05:49.107
<i>disclosure, I almost failed
chemistry, so it's on you.</i>

05:57.333 --> 05:59.567
Mr. Ruxin, we ran a complete physical.

05:59.635 --> 06:03.171
Uh, unfortunately, your sperm
count is exceedingly low.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.172
What?

06:04.239 --> 06:06.607
If I wasn't a doctor, I'd
say frighteningly low.

06:06.675 --> 06:07.608
But you are a doctor.

06:07.676 --> 06:09.594
Right, so I'm not gonna say that.

06:09.678 --> 06:11.813
You realize that's, like, the
worst thing you can tell a man?

06:11.880 --> 06:12.880
Mr. Ruxin, you have AIDS.

06:12.881 --> 06:13.815
What?

06:13.882 --> 06:15.817
You see how that's much worse?

06:15.884 --> 06:16.818
Do I have AIDS?

06:16.885 --> 06:17.819
You do not have AIDS.

06:17.886 --> 06:19.854
Okay, you have terrible bedside manner.

06:19.922 --> 06:20.855
Yes, I do.

06:20.923 --> 06:22.857
Okay, so how could I
have a low sperm count?

06:22.925 --> 06:24.993
There could be some
contributing factors, diet?

06:25.060 --> 06:26.027
I got a good diet.

06:26.095 --> 06:27.028
How about stress?

06:27.096 --> 06:28.129
Yeah, stress is real.

06:28.197 --> 06:30.631
Yeah, I'm the commissioner of
my fantasy football league.

06:30.699 --> 06:32.633
You've brought that up several times.

06:32.701 --> 06:36.170
Have you been working with a
computer on your lap for an

06:36.238 --> 06:37.472
abnormal period of time?

06:37.539 --> 06:39.774
Computer on my lap?

06:39.842 --> 06:43.144
Hmm... The score's not
updating fast enough.

06:43.212 --> 06:45.463
Kevin, let me see your computer.

06:45.547 --> 06:46.931
Give it up.

06:47.016 --> 06:49.183
Now I'm cooking with fire.

06:49.251 --> 06:50.351
Oh! I'm still down by one.

06:50.419 --> 06:53.604
I need one more of...
Ooh, ow, hot, hot, hot.

06:53.689 --> 06:54.655
Nope.

06:54.723 --> 06:57.992
I did notice the tops of your
thighs are completely free of

06:58.060 --> 07:00.395
hair as though they had been singed off.

07:00.446 --> 07:03.464
Doctor, I don't understand why
you think I would lie to you.

07:03.532 --> 07:05.466
I don't know why you would lie to me.

07:05.534 --> 07:07.468
You seem to do it almost on instinct.

07:07.536 --> 07:09.470
Yeah... that is my knee-jerk
reaction is to lie.

07:09.538 --> 07:11.539
I'm just more comfortable
swimming in those waters.

07:11.607 --> 07:13.541
What do you hope to gain
from all this lying?

07:13.608 --> 07:15.543
I guess just like when I walk
out that door, you're, like,

07:15.611 --> 07:17.545
"Wow, that guy seems pretty cool."

07:17.613 --> 07:19.680
I don't think, "There goes
someone pretty cool."

07:19.748 --> 07:23.801
I think, "There goes someone with high
cholesterol and a fertility problem."

07:25.888 --> 07:26.838
Okay, you go.

07:26.922 --> 07:27.889
Here's the plan.

07:27.956 --> 07:30.892
When she leaves her apartment,
these homeless guys are gonna

07:30.959 --> 07:33.359
come up to her, and instead of
asking her for change, they're

07:33.395 --> 07:35.563
gonna ask her to accept this rose.

07:35.630 --> 07:37.565
Then you're gonna come in
and ask her out on a date.

07:37.632 --> 07:39.567
I don't know... you sure
this is gonna work?

07:39.635 --> 07:40.568
All women love <i>The Bachelor.</i>

07:40.635 --> 07:42.836
<i>This is like having a bunch
of homeless Chris Harrisons.</i>

07:42.905 --> 07:43.821
<i>Trust me.</i>

07:43.906 --> 07:46.574
<i>How do you always
find the hole, Andre?</i>

07:46.641 --> 07:47.608
<i>Practice.</i>

07:47.659 --> 07:49.610
<i>Okay, we're on.</i>

07:57.920 --> 07:58.836
<i>Excuse me, ma'am?</i>

07:58.921 --> 08:00.338
<i>Could you spare a smile?</i>

08:00.422 --> 08:01.422
<i>Gross.</i>

08:01.490 --> 08:02.623
<i>Get away from me.</i>

08:02.674 --> 08:03.875
<i>Ooh, shit.</i>

08:03.959 --> 08:05.927
<i>You people are everywhere.</i>

08:05.994 --> 08:07.462
<i>Get a job.</i>

08:07.513 --> 08:09.046
<i>Three, go, go, go.</i>

08:09.131 --> 08:10.348
<i>Sir, he's stealing your cart!</i>

08:10.432 --> 08:11.392
<i>He's stealing your cart!</i>

08:11.433 --> 08:12.350
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

08:12.434 --> 08:14.352
<i>Was that your decoy so
you could jack my stuff?</i>

08:14.436 --> 08:15.186
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

08:15.270 --> 08:16.187
<i>You work for the government?</i>

08:16.271 --> 08:18.189
<i>No, I don't even take insurance.</i>

08:18.273 --> 08:19.190
<i>Put that down.</i>

08:19.274 --> 08:20.475
<i>That's from my dad.</i>

08:20.526 --> 08:21.726
<i>Jerk, you little D-hole!</i>

08:23.445 --> 08:25.446
<i>You don't steal a man's stuff.</i>

08:25.514 --> 08:27.064
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

08:27.149 --> 08:28.232
<i>Ooh, I'm so... Gina!</i>

08:28.317 --> 08:29.233
<i>Hey, how are you?</i>

08:29.318 --> 08:31.068
<i>Check it out... there's a bum fight.</i>

08:31.153 --> 08:32.068
<i>Oh, my God, I love this shit.</i>

08:32.154 --> 08:33.070
<i>Oh, God, your breath.</i>

08:33.155 --> 08:35.706
<i>My breath... you're no
prize yourself, Sparky.</i>

08:35.791 --> 08:37.707
<i>Don't you just love bum fights?</i>

08:37.793 --> 08:42.078
<i>Yeah, of course I love... Who
doesn't love a good bum fight?</i>

08:42.164 --> 08:43.080
<i>How's that feel?</i>

08:43.164 --> 08:44.081
<i>Who do you think's gonna win?</i>

08:44.166 --> 08:45.082
<i>Who do you have?</i>

08:45.167 --> 08:47.919
<i>Uh, I think the big guy's gonna
make the little one his bitch.</i>

08:48.003 --> 08:49.220
<i>I got you now, fish.</i>

08:49.304 --> 08:51.222
<i>You totally called that, Gina.</i>

08:51.306 --> 08:53.424
<i>You won the bet... you want
a coffee or something?</i>

08:53.509 --> 08:55.843
<i>Uh... yeah, sure.</i>

08:55.894 --> 08:56.844
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

08:56.895 --> 08:58.846
<i>Thank you, Andre.</i>

08:58.897 --> 08:59.847
<i>No, no, help me.</i>

08:59.898 --> 09:00.848
<i>Pete!</i>

09:00.899 --> 09:01.849
<i>Oh, what's this?</i>

09:01.900 --> 09:03.851
<i>A rose, my lady?</i>

09:03.902 --> 09:06.487
<i>Gross.</i>

09:06.555 --> 09:10.358
<i>Okay, so we'll take pieces of
leaves and maybe some onions,</i>

09:10.409 --> 09:13.578
<i>and we'll put them in a slide,
underneath the microscope, and</i>

09:13.662 --> 09:15.196
<i>we'll magnify it like ten times.</i>

09:15.247 --> 09:17.198
<i>Who knows... maybe we'll
even do a hundred times.</i>

09:17.249 --> 09:19.433
<i>What were you guys doing
up in that bedroom?</i>

09:19.501 --> 09:20.418
<i>Was it sex?</i>

09:21.503 --> 09:22.603
<i>Why were you on top?</i>

09:22.671 --> 09:23.671
<i>Oh, all right.</i>

09:23.738 --> 09:26.040
<i>I got to get more onions, just... oh.</i>

09:26.091 --> 09:28.042
<i>We're on a deadline here.</i>

09:31.580 --> 09:33.264
<i>Brain boner.</i>

09:33.348 --> 09:34.465
<i>Oh, hey, Ellie.</i>

09:34.550 --> 09:35.466
<i>Nice haircut.</i>

09:35.551 --> 09:36.467
<i>I'm Charlie.</i>

09:36.552 --> 09:37.468
<i>Don't talk back to me.</i>

09:37.553 --> 09:38.469
<i>I'm an adult.</i>

09:38.554 --> 09:41.389
<i>Oh, cool... let me know when
you're done with this.</i>

09:41.440 --> 09:43.391
<i>This will make an awesome guest bong.</i>

09:43.458 --> 09:44.525
<i>Can I ask you about sex?</i>

09:44.593 --> 09:45.526
<i>Sure, buddy.</i>

09:45.594 --> 09:48.279
<i>How old are you?</i>

09:48.363 --> 09:49.280
<i>Eight.</i>

09:49.364 --> 09:50.815
<i>Hmm... do you own a waterbed?</i>

09:50.899 --> 09:51.816
<i>No.</i>

09:51.900 --> 09:53.834
<i>How many women have you had sex with?</i>

09:53.902 --> 09:54.835
<i>None.</i>

09:54.903 --> 09:55.820
<i>What?</i>

09:55.904 --> 09:57.071
<i>Wow, you're way behind.</i>

09:57.122 --> 09:59.407
<i>I'll introduce you to my
friend Andre's sister.</i>

09:59.458 --> 10:02.643
<i>What I want to do here is find
the perfect dining experience.</i>

10:02.711 --> 10:05.129
<i>Andre, we have been sitting
here for a half an hour.</i>

10:05.214 --> 10:08.416
<i>If you want to give me
a gift, just pick one.</i>

10:08.467 --> 10:11.219
<i>Well, right here is one of
my favorite restaurants.</i>

10:11.286 --> 10:12.220
<i>It's called Rivera.</i>

10:12.287 --> 10:13.588
<i>Great... sounds fantastic.</i>

10:13.639 --> 10:14.589
<i>Let's do that.</i>

10:14.656 --> 10:16.724
<i>You didn't even hear
what the options are.</i>

10:16.792 --> 10:19.227
<i>I just love the name of it,
Rivera... sounds great.</i>

10:19.294 --> 10:23.564
<i>Rivera is haute cuisine, and
what I need you to do is help me</i>

10:23.632 --> 10:26.267
<i>make a reservation because
Markie the hostess is kind of</i>

10:26.335 --> 10:27.335
<i>irritated with me right now.</i>

10:27.402 --> 10:29.737
<i>Now I need a table for three at 8:15.</i>

10:29.804 --> 10:32.490
<i>I also want to make sure that
the bathroom is nowhere near</i>

10:32.574 --> 10:35.009
<i>where the table is, so make...
If you keep giving at this</i>

10:35.077 --> 10:37.078
<i>rate, honestly, Andre, I'm going
to be peeling onions for my own</i>

10:37.145 --> 10:37.912
<i>dinner.</i>

10:37.979 --> 10:38.913
<i>You're gonna want to.</i>

10:38.980 --> 10:39.914
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

10:39.981 --> 10:40.748
<i>Hey.</i>

10:40.815 --> 10:41.749
<i>Thank God.</i>

10:41.816 --> 10:43.751
<i>Big time Gina date coming up, okay?</i>

10:43.818 --> 10:46.020
<i>My first idea was maybe I'll
commission, like, a cool piece</i>

10:46.088 --> 10:48.539
<i>of graffiti for her, but then I
remembered she just basically</i>

10:48.624 --> 10:49.557
<i>hates poor people so that's out.</i>

10:49.625 --> 10:51.559
<i>She sounds like a real keeper.</i>

10:51.627 --> 10:54.378
<i>No, she's the worst, but I
have to be at my best so I can</i>

10:54.463 --> 10:55.713
<i>truly impress her.</i>

10:55.797 --> 10:57.048
<i>You like her, don't you?</i>

10:57.132 --> 10:59.132
<i>No, I hate her... I'm just
focused on the hate date.</i>

10:59.134 --> 11:00.051
<i>I don't know, Pete.</i>

11:00.135 --> 11:01.902
<i>What about those flowers you got her?</i>

11:01.970 --> 11:02.903
<i>Yeah, they were hate flowers.</i>

11:02.971 --> 11:03.904
<i>And the poem you wrote?</i>

11:03.972 --> 11:04.722
<i>Hate poem.</i>

11:04.806 --> 11:07.441
<i>Beware... beware and do not fall for her.</i>

11:07.509 --> 11:08.693
<i>And I'll see you at dinner.</i>

11:08.777 --> 11:09.694
<i>Okay, bye-bye.</i>

11:09.778 --> 11:10.695
<i>Bye.</i>

11:10.779 --> 11:14.532
<i>Jenny, as a woman, what would
be the ultimate date for you?</i>

11:14.616 --> 11:17.618
<i>Have you been to Rivera?</i>

11:17.686 --> 11:19.153
<i>Why are we here, Taco?</i>

11:19.221 --> 11:20.554
<i>You know I hate Chinatown.</i>

11:20.622 --> 11:23.783
<i>This place has something that's gonna help
you with your sperm count, my friend.</i>

11:23.825 --> 11:25.760
<i>We gonna chug a punch
of three penis wine?</i>

11:25.827 --> 11:29.463
<i>No, three penis wine builds the
theater, but it doesn't fill the seats.</i>

11:29.531 --> 11:32.466
<i>If you want real results, you need
to go straight to the source.</i>

11:32.534 --> 11:33.467
<i>And what's that?</i>

11:33.535 --> 11:34.552
<i>It's off the menu.</i>

11:34.636 --> 11:37.254
<i>This is one of only four
restaurants in Chicago that</i>

11:37.339 --> 11:38.839
<i>serves animal D and B.</i>

11:38.890 --> 11:40.007
<i>And what's D and B?</i>

11:40.058 --> 11:41.258
<i>Dick and Balls.</i>

11:41.343 --> 11:43.394
<i>Oh, dear God.</i>

11:43.478 --> 11:45.346
<i>Mmm, yummy.</i>

11:45.397 --> 11:48.282
<i>Delicious male organs.</i>

11:48.350 --> 11:50.584
<i>Horse, donkey.</i>

11:50.652 --> 11:51.652
<i>Mmm.</i>

11:51.720 --> 11:52.653
<i>Is this legal?</i>

11:52.721 --> 11:54.288
<i>Mmm, some parts of China.</i>

11:54.356 --> 11:55.289
<i>What's in there?</i>

11:55.357 --> 11:56.490
<i>The pee-pee platter.</i>

11:56.558 --> 12:00.828
<i>Six kinds of penis, four
kinds of testicles.</i>

12:00.895 --> 12:02.463
<i>That's a spicy meatballs.</i>

12:02.531 --> 12:04.749
<i>Just think of it as a genital jambalaya.</i>

12:04.833 --> 12:06.767
<i>Can't I just take some
sort of pill for this?</i>

12:06.835 --> 12:09.420
<i>Ruxin, you can lead a horse to
the horse cock, but you can't</i>

12:09.504 --> 12:10.421
<i>make him eat it.</i>

12:10.505 --> 12:12.440
<i>That is not a Chinese proverb.</i>

12:12.507 --> 12:14.442
<i>That's what it said on
my fortune scrotum.</i>

12:14.509 --> 12:16.677
<i>So, what do I use, like,
a chopstick or spork?</i>

12:16.745 --> 12:18.012
<i>This isn't charm school.</i>

12:18.079 --> 12:21.182
<i>Grab a hold of that cock and
shove it down your throat.</i>

12:21.249 --> 12:23.951
<i>Does eating this animal dick make me gay?</i>

12:24.019 --> 12:27.304
<i>It's animal dick... at the
very worst, it's bestiality.</i>

12:27.389 --> 12:28.856
<i>Yeah, put it in your mouth.</i>

12:28.924 --> 12:30.858
<i>Mm-hmm, there it goes.</i>

12:30.925 --> 12:32.193
<i>Slip it in.</i>

12:32.260 --> 12:33.728
<i>Put the dick in your mouth.</i>

12:33.795 --> 12:35.629
<i>Just the tip... mmm.</i>

12:35.697 --> 12:37.948
<i>Dear God.</i>

12:38.033 --> 12:39.233
<i>Mmm.</i>

12:39.284 --> 12:40.985
<i>This tastes like dick.</i>

12:41.069 --> 12:44.905
<i>Aw, man... this place does penis right.</i>

12:44.956 --> 12:45.990
<i>Yummy, huh?</i>

12:47.955 --> 12:51.007
<i>Ah, think I just clipped a vein.</i>

12:51.092 --> 12:53.940
<i>All right, let's split this guy.</i>

12:54.060 --> 12:55.545
<i>All right, give me your plate.</i>

13:03.905 --> 13:07.307
Welcome to a culinary
experience like no other.

13:07.375 --> 13:08.496
I'd like to propose a toast.

13:08.543 --> 13:09.643
Oh, God.

13:09.711 --> 13:12.546
Tonight, we're going on a
journey, and when we go on that

13:12.614 --> 13:15.649
journey, we must board a ship.

13:15.717 --> 13:17.818
A friendship.

13:17.886 --> 13:18.986
I'd like to jump overboard.

13:19.054 --> 13:21.388
I'm saving you and pulling you back.

13:21.456 --> 13:22.389
Tonight, we board a friendship.

13:22.457 --> 13:23.223
Cheers.

13:23.291 --> 13:25.291
And I hope that... Okay,
okay, let me get in there.

13:25.293 --> 13:28.062
Can we just do it... can you just
do it again so I can get in there?

13:28.129 --> 13:30.898
So tonight we board a
friendship and... Cheers.

13:30.965 --> 13:31.899
You guys are so quick.

13:31.966 --> 13:36.236
Okay, I'm just gonna leave my glass
here and then you guys can toast... me?

13:36.304 --> 13:40.407
Actually, you're not supposed to drink
that wine... it's a sniffing wine.

13:40.475 --> 13:43.410
You don't sniff wine;
You sniff glue, Andre.

13:43.478 --> 13:44.445
No, you don't drink it.

13:44.496 --> 13:45.617
Hey, guys, sorry we're late.

13:45.646 --> 13:46.580
There you are.

13:46.647 --> 13:49.867
No, no, no, this is a private gift
that I'm giving to Kevin and Jenny.

13:49.951 --> 13:51.702
And gifts are meant to be shared.

13:51.786 --> 13:53.704
With you guys, not with everybody.

13:53.788 --> 13:56.788
Andre, are you being rude to our guest...
oh, would you like a glass of wine?

13:56.791 --> 13:58.542
It's for sniffing, but you can drink it.

13:58.626 --> 13:59.626
Mmm, smells really cheap.

13:59.627 --> 14:01.378
You guys all remember Gina, of course.

14:01.463 --> 14:02.379
Gina, hey... Kevin.

14:02.464 --> 14:03.213
Hi.

14:03.298 --> 14:05.215
Hey, how are... No, we went
to high school together.

14:05.300 --> 14:06.216
Right.

14:06.301 --> 14:07.217
This is, uh, my wife Jenny.

14:07.302 --> 14:08.051
Hi.

14:08.136 --> 14:10.104
Hi... did you go to our
high school as well?

14:10.171 --> 14:10.888
No, I didn't.

14:10.972 --> 14:14.742
Oh, you look like one of those girls
that went to our high school.

14:14.809 --> 14:15.476
Thank you.

14:15.543 --> 14:16.076
Andre!

14:16.144 --> 14:17.227
Hey! Hello.

14:17.312 --> 14:19.312
That homeless guy was all
over your shit, you guys.

14:19.347 --> 14:20.114
It was so hot.

14:20.181 --> 14:21.115
Did you get his number?

14:21.182 --> 14:22.983
What? I didn't get his number, no.

14:23.034 --> 14:23.951
Did he deny you?

14:24.018 --> 14:26.286
No, I gave him money,
and it was fine, okay?

14:26.354 --> 14:27.988
You paid for homeless man sex?

14:28.056 --> 14:28.906
No, no, no!

14:28.990 --> 14:29.923
And he still said no.

14:29.991 --> 14:31.271
Another glass of the vermentino.

14:31.326 --> 14:32.286
Oh, thank you very much.

14:32.327 --> 14:32.827
Thank you.

14:32.860 --> 14:34.795
And this is the deconstructed
chile relleno imported

14:34.863 --> 14:36.880
from Barcelona, in a gentle
shower of pecorino-romano.

14:36.965 --> 14:38.499
You know you're just a waiter, right?

14:38.566 --> 14:39.066
Excuse me?

14:39.134 --> 14:41.301
You don't need to tell us
where our food's from, right?

14:41.369 --> 14:44.071
I mean, we want to eat it,
not hang it on a wall.

14:44.139 --> 14:46.340
Don't talk to us like you're a
professor at Hogwarts, okay?

14:46.407 --> 14:48.568
Well, technically, Hogwarts
is like a school for magic.

14:48.576 --> 14:51.395
And this is... Okay, go tell it to
your homeless boyfriend, Andre.

14:51.479 --> 14:53.430
The lady would like a cosmo, please.

14:53.515 --> 14:56.083
And what kind of vodka
would the <i>lady</i> prefer?

14:56.151 --> 14:58.235
The kind that doesn't
have your bullshit in it.

14:58.319 --> 14:59.286
I'm so sorry.

14:59.354 --> 15:02.856
Okay, so nice to be with everybody
all dressed up and looking great.

15:02.907 --> 15:04.587
Gina, you look absolutely
stunning tonight.

15:04.592 --> 15:05.125
Thank you.

15:05.193 --> 15:05.526
Yeah.

15:05.593 --> 15:07.713
Although, it's not really a
compliment coming from you

15:07.745 --> 15:11.665
because you look like you were in the
jerk-off stand at a Romanian sex circus.

15:12.734 --> 15:13.417
Fives, bitch.

15:13.501 --> 15:15.752
And here's to Gina, guys.

15:15.837 --> 15:16.954
I like you, Gina.

15:17.038 --> 15:17.704
Oh, everybody toast.

15:17.755 --> 15:18.789
We'll have a toast.

15:18.873 --> 15:19.606
Come on in.

15:19.674 --> 15:22.259
I got a bunch of animal crank
running around my stomach right

15:22.343 --> 15:23.877
now, so what exactly is the plan?

15:23.928 --> 15:26.046
All right, well, the animal DNB
should be working instantly,

15:26.097 --> 15:28.265
so we're gonna test out how
your guys are swimming.

15:28.349 --> 15:29.183
Where?

15:29.250 --> 15:29.967
In my lab.

15:30.051 --> 15:31.635
You talking about Kevin's garage?

15:31.719 --> 15:34.605
I got a professional entry-level
children's microscope right here.

15:34.689 --> 15:37.858
All I need is for you to
rub one out on this slide.

15:37.925 --> 15:40.527
This slide, you want me to
jerk off onto this slide?

15:40.595 --> 15:45.032
Yep.

15:45.099 --> 15:46.116
Oh, sorry.

15:46.201 --> 15:47.150
What are you doing?!

15:47.235 --> 15:48.118
I need some privacy.

15:48.203 --> 15:50.737
Well, if you want me to go get
something that'll help you

15:50.788 --> 15:53.574
out with the whole process...
Uh, yeah, okay.

15:53.625 --> 15:57.244
First, I want to start with the
pool scene from <i>Wild Things.</i>

15:57.295 --> 15:57.795
<i>Okay.</i>

15:57.812 --> 16:00.380
<i>Or that grape-stomping video
where the woman falls and gets</i>

16:00.448 --> 16:01.569
<i>the wind knocked out of her.</i>

16:01.616 --> 16:03.250
<i>She's, like,.</i>

16:03.301 --> 16:04.501
<i>I love that video.</i>

16:04.586 --> 16:07.387
<i>If you don't have that, then, like,
an Abercrombie catalog, 2002.</i>

16:07.455 --> 16:09.690
<i>Kevin must have one of those
hidden away somewhere.</i>

16:09.757 --> 16:10.157
<i>Okay.</i>

16:10.225 --> 16:12.643
<i>I'm gonna go put these cock-and-ball
leftovers in the fridge.</i>

16:12.727 --> 16:13.227
<i>Have fun.</i>

16:13.294 --> 16:15.395
<i>All right. Hey, hit the
lights on the way out?</i>

16:15.463 --> 16:15.812
<i>Yes.</i>

16:15.897 --> 16:17.731
<i>It's the only way I can do it.</i>

16:17.798 --> 16:18.838
<i>Enjoy pleasuring yourself.</i>

16:18.900 --> 16:22.102
<i>All right. Well, we've done this in worse
places, haven't we, little Rodney?</i>

16:22.170 --> 16:24.154
<i>Wasn't one of you guys in the band?</i>

16:24.239 --> 16:27.274
<i>Andre was in the sub
band, the Magic Club.</i>

16:27.325 --> 16:28.075
<i>That's right!</i>

16:28.142 --> 16:29.576
<i>It was a whole club for magic?</i>

16:29.644 --> 16:31.695
<i>No, no, it was just him by himself.</i>

16:31.779 --> 16:32.746
<i>He met once a week.</i>

16:32.813 --> 16:35.249
<i>The picture in the yearbook
must have been amazing.</i>

16:35.316 --> 16:37.000
<i>Can we actually get the check, please?</i>

16:37.085 --> 16:40.220
<i>No, no, no. I would hate
for this date to end.</i>

16:40.288 --> 16:42.372
<i>We've been having so much fun, right?</i>

16:42.457 --> 16:43.378
<i>Quick question for you.</i>

16:43.458 --> 16:45.926
<i>Have you had the distinct
pleasure of experiencing.</i>

16:45.993 --> 16:46.843
<i>Andre's podcast?</i>

16:46.928 --> 16:47.261
<i>What?</i>

16:47.328 --> 16:48.845
<i>Please... No, no, that's mine.</i>

16:48.930 --> 16:51.181
<i>This is, this is something
that I think you in particular</i>

16:51.266 --> 16:52.215
<i>would really enjoy.</i>

16:52.300 --> 16:54.851
<i>This is one of my favorite
episodes of what Andre calls.</i>

16:54.936 --> 16:55.519
<i>Witchy Woman.</i>

16:55.603 --> 16:56.303
<i>What?</i>

16:56.354 --> 17:00.440
<i>It combines my love of Don Henley
and magic... Here he goes.</i>

17:00.508 --> 17:03.277
Welcome to another
edition of <i>Witchy Woman.</i>

17:03.344 --> 17:06.445
<i>In a top hat! It's glorious.</i>

17:06.446 --> 17:08.365
<i>Magic... it can be interesting
or illuminating, erotic</i>

17:08.449 --> 17:09.366
<i>or entertaining.</i>

17:09.450 --> 17:10.367
<i>Whoops.</i>

17:10.451 --> 17:11.451
<i>This is shit.</i>

17:11.519 --> 17:13.704
<i>I mean, this is the worst
shit I've ever seen.</i>

17:13.788 --> 17:15.722
<i>I told my Web guy not to upload that one.</i>

17:15.790 --> 17:17.457
<i>That's another episode of Witchy Woman.</i>

17:17.525 --> 17:18.925
<i>You want to see some magic?</i>

17:18.992 --> 17:19.492
<i>Get ready.</i>

17:19.527 --> 17:20.077
<i>Come on.</i>

17:20.161 --> 17:24.631
<i>You never know when it might disappear.</i>

17:24.699 --> 17:25.749
<i>Oh!</i>

17:25.833 --> 17:26.883
<i>He's gone.</i>

17:26.968 --> 17:27.901
<i>No, he's still there!</i>

17:27.969 --> 17:29.219
<i>He's still there!</i>

17:29.304 --> 17:32.806
<i>Oh, but he's going, he's
going, and now he's gone!</i>

17:32.873 --> 17:35.075
<i>What happened to David Lame?</i>

17:35.143 --> 17:37.311
<i>I just appreciate you didn't
call me David Cockerfield.</i>

17:37.378 --> 17:39.262
<i>And this is Andre's podcast, everybody.</i>

17:39.347 --> 17:41.315
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

17:41.382 --> 17:42.432
<i>Andre, thank you so much.</i>

17:42.517 --> 17:44.484
<i>I could not have done this without you.</i>

17:44.552 --> 17:45.652
<i>All right, let's hit it.</i>

17:45.720 --> 17:46.403
<i>Good night, guys.</i>

17:46.487 --> 17:47.254
<i>Good night.</i>

17:47.322 --> 17:48.405
<i>Have a lovely evening.</i>

17:48.489 --> 17:49.740
<i>Such a great gift.</i>

17:49.824 --> 17:50.657
<i>I mean, really.</i>

17:50.725 --> 17:51.742
<i>Cheers.</i>

17:51.826 --> 17:53.694
<i>Cheers.</i>

17:53.745 --> 17:55.112
<i>Look at these projects.</i>

17:55.196 --> 17:56.079
<i>They're really good.</i>

17:56.164 --> 17:58.532
<i>Did you guys know that a
lemon can be a battery?</i>

17:58.583 --> 18:00.367
<i>Huh. I knew it could be a weapon.</i>

18:00.418 --> 18:02.252
<i>You guys can keep your lemons.</i>

18:02.337 --> 18:03.704
<i>Charlie's project is fantastic.</i>

18:03.755 --> 18:07.257
<i>Can I ask why you are so invested
in Charlie's project today?</i>

18:07.342 --> 18:09.977
<i>Well, if he's gonna be Ellie's
boyfriend, then I want</i>

18:10.044 --> 18:11.461
<i>to take an interest in him.</i>

18:11.546 --> 18:12.586
<i>That's really sweet, babe.</i>

18:12.597 --> 18:15.132
<i>Not as sweet as those meatballs
and sausage you left</i>

18:15.216 --> 18:15.966
<i>in the fridge.</i>

18:16.050 --> 18:16.933
<i>They were delicious.</i>

18:17.018 --> 18:18.385
<i>I ate, like, all of them.</i>

18:18.436 --> 18:19.386
<i>Oh, those weren't meatballs.</i>

18:19.437 --> 18:21.605
<i>Those were, uh... Hello, MacArthurs!</i>

18:21.689 --> 18:22.439
<i>Lindsay! Wow!</i>

18:22.523 --> 18:22.856
<i>Hi!</i>

18:22.923 --> 18:24.024
<i>It's great to see you.</i>

18:24.091 --> 18:25.025
<i>Great to see you, too.</i>

18:25.092 --> 18:26.860
<i>Yeah. Are you Ellie's teacher this...?</i>

18:26.927 --> 18:27.694
<i>Oh, God, no.</i>

18:27.762 --> 18:28.979
<i>I'm running the science fair.</i>

18:29.063 --> 18:31.198
<i>Well, you know, she still speaks
incredibly highly of you.</i>

18:31.265 --> 18:34.534
<i>And how many four-letter words
is she using when she does it?</i>

18:34.602 --> 18:38.321
<i>So, Ellie, why don't
you show me what you've done?</i>

18:38.406 --> 18:41.291
<i>My project is "What's in Your Landfill?"</i>

18:41.376 --> 18:42.709
<i>What is in your landfill?</i>

18:42.777 --> 18:44.327
<i>This stuff, apparently.</i>

18:44.412 --> 18:46.546
<i>Oh, we've got beer bottles, cigarettes.</i>

18:46.614 --> 18:47.881
<i>Is that a condom?</i>

18:47.948 --> 18:48.915
<i>That's mine.</i>

18:48.966 --> 18:50.300
<i>It belongs there. It's used.</i>

18:50.385 --> 18:51.334
<i>I don't know, Ellie.</i>

18:51.419 --> 18:54.471
<i>It looks like you just took a
bunch of trash and then put some</i>

18:54.555 --> 18:55.555
<i>dirt on top of it.</i>

18:55.623 --> 18:56.673
<i>You think this is crap?</i>

18:56.758 --> 18:59.092
<i>Did you see these other</i>
<i>projects?</i>

18:59.143 --> 18:59.893
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

18:59.960 --> 19:01.762
<i>Okay. I see a lot has changed.</i>

19:01.813 --> 19:02.896
<i>Have a wonderful day.</i>

19:02.963 --> 19:05.482
<i>This is what we prepared
for, so lock it in!</i>

19:05.566 --> 19:07.567
<i>Okay, let's see what we have here.</i>

19:07.635 --> 19:09.102
<i>I have 20 slides prepared.</i>

19:09.153 --> 19:10.270
<i>Very impressive.</i>

19:10.321 --> 19:11.605
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:11.656 --> 19:14.858
<i>Kevin, what are you doing
helping Charlie McReddin?</i>

19:14.942 --> 19:17.661
<i>Charlie is Ellie's boyfriend, so...
Oh, I see.</i>

19:17.745 --> 19:19.863
<i>Well, why don't you show
me the first slide?</i>

19:19.947 --> 19:21.331
<i>They're onion skins.</i>

19:21.416 --> 19:23.083
<i>Onion skins.</i>

19:23.150 --> 19:24.701
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

19:24.786 --> 19:28.505
<i>Excuse me. Is that what I think it is?</i>

19:29.256 --> 19:31.040
<i>Oh, that's semen.</i>

19:31.125 --> 19:32.926
<i>Taco!</i>

19:32.993 --> 19:34.294
<i>It's not mine.</i>

19:34.345 --> 19:35.307
<i>It's a friend of ours.</i>

19:35.427 --> 19:37.648
<i>Not the friend whose penis
you broke with your...</i>

19:37.768 --> 19:40.884
<i>Okay, you are disgusting
people, and you should not be</i>

19:40.968 --> 19:41.968
<i>around children.</i>

19:42.019 --> 19:44.437
<i>Charlie, this was very
inappropriate to bring to school.</i>

19:44.505 --> 19:45.369
<i>You need to speak to the principal.</i>

19:45.489 --> 19:47.390
<i>But it wasn't my fault.</i>

19:47.475 --> 19:48.691
<i>Disappointing, McReddin.</i>

19:48.776 --> 19:49.476
<i>Not bad, huh?</i>

19:49.527 --> 19:50.110
<i>Stop talking.</i>

19:50.177 --> 19:51.311
<i>Those boys are swimming now.</i>

19:51.362 --> 19:52.713
<i>Please tell me you didn't make that here.</i>

19:52.833 --> 19:54.583
<i>I saw you guys having sex.</i>

19:54.703 --> 19:55.945
<i>What? What?!</i>

19:56.065 --> 19:57.650
<i>What?! No!</i>

19:57.701 --> 19:58.643
<i>And he saw me watching.</i>

19:58.763 --> 20:00.153
<i>Really?!</i>

20:00.204 --> 20:01.738
<i>It looked boring.</i>

20:01.822 --> 20:03.665
<i>It didn't seem like you guys
were having a good time.</i>

20:03.785 --> 20:04.755
<i>Excuse me?</i>

20:04.875 --> 20:06.459
<i>It was Missionary Wednesdays.</i>

20:06.527 --> 20:07.487
<i>No one's ever satisfied.</i>

20:07.495 --> 20:09.412
<i>Well, you didn't stay till the end.</i>

20:09.497 --> 20:10.641
<i>Oh, did one of you finish?</i>

20:10.761 --> 20:12.610
<i>Usually, it just kind of tatters off.</i>

Hey, Kevin, guess what.

20:26.848 --> 20:28.382
Mission accomplished.

20:28.450 --> 20:29.826
No, no, no, I haven't
told her off just yet.

20:29.908 --> 20:31.475
As soon as she comes in, bam!

20:31.543 --> 20:32.676
I'm shutting it down!

20:32.744 --> 20:34.612
No prom for you! Pete wins!

20:34.679 --> 20:35.479
Hey, Pete?

20:35.547 --> 20:37.932
I gotta go. Hey.

20:38.016 --> 20:40.113
I made us coffee.

20:40.233 --> 20:41.104
Cool.

20:41.224 --> 20:42.069
So, I had a great time last night.

20:42.154 --> 20:44.089
Yeah, last night was fun.

20:44.209 --> 20:45.606
So, do you want to go out again?

20:45.690 --> 20:51.412
Really? Well... I'd love to.

20:51.496 --> 20:52.196
Mmm, yeah!

20:52.247 --> 20:55.310
Oh, Gibiatti!
