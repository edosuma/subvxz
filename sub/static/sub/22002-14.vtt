00:19.814 --> 00:21.050
Oh, yeah.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.114
I'm Philip Davidson.

00:27.150 --> 00:29.195
Detective Jake Peralta
asked me to drop by.

00:29.230 --> 00:32.000
Mm, the dentist who murdered someone.

00:32.034 --> 00:34.170
Spoiler alert: they think you did it.

00:34.205 --> 00:37.513
Can you show him to
Interrogation Room C, please?

00:37.549 --> 00:39.451
- Have fun in there.
- Thank you.

00:44.122 --> 00:45.359
What are you smiling about?

00:45.395 --> 00:46.733
How uncomfortable this guy is.

00:46.769 --> 00:49.530
Jacked up the thermostat,
got the table all sticky,

00:49.565 --> 00:52.211
made one of the chair legs
too short, and worst of all,

00:52.247 --> 00:53.529
I had Gina greet him.

00:53.565 --> 00:55.069
- What did you have her do?
- Be herself.

00:55.105 --> 00:56.805
- Poor son of a bitch.
- Yeah.

00:56.841 --> 00:58.041
Why are you wearing a tuxedo?

00:58.077 --> 00:59.746
Kevin and I are attending the opera.

00:59.782 --> 01:00.815
Ooh, the opera.

01:00.851 --> 01:02.153
Is it the one Bugs Bunny sings?

01:03.225 --> 01:04.447
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:04.483 --> 01:06.656
- So, who's this?
- This is Philip Davidson.

01:06.692 --> 01:08.026
- What do we have on him?
- Clear motive,

01:08.062 --> 01:10.101
clear means, and a nonexistent alibi,

01:10.136 --> 01:11.803
but the DA won't bring a charge

01:11.838 --> 01:13.372
because he says it's all circumstantial.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.443
We want to bring this guy down,
have to get him to confess

01:15.478 --> 01:17.548
right here, right now.

01:17.583 --> 01:20.084
Mm. An interrogation
with a ticking clock

01:20.119 --> 01:21.535
and everything on the line?

01:22.239 --> 01:24.585
I better call Kevin and tell him
I won't be attending the opera.

01:24.621 --> 01:26.562
There's someone else
I'd rather hear sing.

01:26.615 --> 01:28.166
- Oh, damn!
- Hello, Kevin.

01:28.201 --> 01:29.902
I won't be joining you
at the opera tonight...

01:29.937 --> 01:31.676
Oh, sorry, I didn't know you
were on the phone already.

01:31.712 --> 01:33.515
- Oh, damn!
- It's under my name, H-O-L...

01:49.406 --> 01:52.406
<font color="#741b47">Sync & corrections by </font><font color="#ead1dc">emeline-whovian</font>
<font color="#741b47">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:55.281 --> 01:57.117
You're right. He did it.

01:57.153 --> 01:58.987
But we have no murder weapon,
no witnesses,

01:59.023 --> 02:01.860
and you really didn't find any
usable forensic evidence?

02:01.896 --> 02:03.526
The body was discovered
rotting in the Pine Barrens.

02:03.562 --> 02:05.932
It'd been rained on for weeks
and chewed up by coyotes.

02:05.968 --> 02:07.370
The only other DNA other than the vic's

02:07.406 --> 02:09.374
was some bear semen found in the hair.

02:09.410 --> 02:10.933
- Right. Who found the body?
- Hikers.

02:10.969 --> 02:13.072
You're really just gonna blow
past the bear semen detail?

02:13.108 --> 02:14.977
I imagine a bear mistook
the rotting corpse

02:15.013 --> 02:17.751
for a female of its species
and had intercourse with it.

02:17.787 --> 02:19.086
- Nothing I haven't seen before.
- It isn't?

02:19.122 --> 02:21.023
Let's get in here.
Start working this guy.

02:21.059 --> 02:23.330
Oh. You're gonna come in with me.

02:23.366 --> 02:25.532
I just thought maybe
you'd watch from out here,

02:25.568 --> 02:27.671
you know, pull me out when
I'm getting too hot.

02:27.706 --> 02:29.106
Call me a loose cannon.

02:29.141 --> 02:30.541
You know, classic Captain stuff.

02:30.576 --> 02:31.977
Peralta, do you know

02:32.012 --> 02:33.682
what I miss most about
being a detective?

02:33.717 --> 02:35.617
A good interrogation.

02:35.652 --> 02:37.421
Breaking suspects down.

02:37.456 --> 02:40.026
Talking quietly and then
talking real loud.

02:40.061 --> 02:43.067
Looking away and then looking
right in their eyes.

02:45.737 --> 02:47.404
Leaning.

02:47.439 --> 02:49.443
- That was amazing.
- So, can I join you?

02:49.478 --> 02:52.181
Well, a lot of these
techniques do work better

02:52.216 --> 02:54.183
with two people:
you know, good cop/bad cop,

02:54.218 --> 02:55.586
crazy cop/sane cop,

02:55.621 --> 02:57.589
fast-talking streetwise cop
and Hong Kong cop,

02:57.624 --> 03:00.028
AKA the "Rush Hour."
You know what? Let's do this.

03:00.063 --> 03:01.463
Let's break this son of a bitch!

03:03.770 --> 03:06.171
- Hello, Philip.
- Detective.

03:06.206 --> 03:07.607
This is Captain Raymond Holt.

03:07.642 --> 03:09.577
He's a bit of a legend
in interrogation circles.

03:09.612 --> 03:11.515
Hey, Cap, who's the scariest
person you've ever gotten

03:11.550 --> 03:13.227
- a confession out of?
- Connie Buttons.

03:13.559 --> 03:15.454
Okay, thought it was gonna
sound a little cooler,

03:15.490 --> 03:17.592
but no matter.
So, shall we recap the night

03:17.627 --> 03:19.705
that Robert Tupper was murdered
Friday the 22nd?

03:19.741 --> 03:21.946
I believe you were the last person
to see him alive, correct?

03:21.982 --> 03:24.912
No. I'd imagine whoever
killed him saw him after I did.

03:24.948 --> 03:27.718
Ooh, nice dodge.
You're quick, like a cat.

03:27.754 --> 03:30.058
- Like a dancer.
- Like Great Tiger.

03:31.066 --> 03:32.367
From "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out."

03:32.403 --> 03:33.909
He could teleport around the ring.

03:33.945 --> 03:35.078
Most people thought it was
impossible to get past him.

03:35.114 --> 03:36.282
I beat him every time.

03:36.318 --> 03:37.619
You just punch him when he gets dizzy.

03:37.655 --> 03:39.663
Really?! I mean, duh.

03:39.699 --> 03:41.101
- Everyone knows that.
- Tell us about Friday.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.538
I had a late afternoon surgery.

03:42.574 --> 03:44.676
Simple gum graft.
It wrapped around 6:00,

03:44.712 --> 03:45.945
and then Robert and I talked after.

03:45.981 --> 03:47.315
And who else was in the office?

03:47.351 --> 03:48.852
Our hygienist and anesthesiologist

03:48.888 --> 03:51.298
had gone home, and Grace,
who usually locks up,

03:51.334 --> 03:53.607
had left early because her
grandson had a school play.

03:53.643 --> 03:55.064
So it was just you and Robert.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.532
- No witnesses?
- That's lucky.

03:56.568 --> 03:59.136
It wasn't lucky because
there was nothing to witness.

03:59.628 --> 04:01.535
Robert just wanted to talk about firing

04:01.570 --> 04:03.219
one of our office assistants, Cheryl.

04:03.255 --> 04:04.841
- And that's all you discussed?
- Yeah.

04:04.877 --> 04:06.050
- Nothing else?
- Nah.

04:06.086 --> 04:07.479
Zero other subjects were mentioned?

04:07.515 --> 04:09.084
- None.
- Not even how gross gum grafts are?

04:09.120 --> 04:10.176
They're really not that gross.

04:10.212 --> 04:12.115
Liar! About the gum graft thing,

04:12.151 --> 04:13.185
and about the meeting.

04:13.221 --> 04:14.788
We just talked about Cheryl.

04:15.126 --> 04:17.129
Right. And, of course,
there's no way for me

04:17.165 --> 04:18.531
to check if that's true, because

04:18.567 --> 04:20.741
because whoever took Robert's phone
wiped all of his calendars.

04:21.906 --> 04:24.675
Except... it was all backed up
on his home laptop.

04:24.710 --> 04:27.235
Would you like to hear what he
said the meeting was about?

04:27.941 --> 04:30.358
"7:00 p.m. Talked with Philip about..."

04:30.394 --> 04:31.664
Missing meds.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.004
Ooh. Did I get that right?

04:34.040 --> 04:35.125
Uh, yeah.

04:35.172 --> 04:37.948
But "missing meds" hardly
sounds like "firing Cheryl,"

04:37.984 --> 04:39.063
so maybe you want to explain...

04:39.099 --> 04:40.333
He thought Cheryl was stealing Diazepam.

04:40.369 --> 04:41.903
That's why he wanted to fire her.

04:41.939 --> 04:43.073
Any other questions?

04:43.109 --> 04:43.941
Uh...

04:45.470 --> 04:47.192
Boy, you really thought you
had him with that one, huh?

04:47.228 --> 04:49.197
- Well, I...
- You got so excited for it.

04:49.233 --> 04:51.333
Let me guess, you, ah,
practiced that notebook flip?

04:51.369 --> 04:53.103
- Well, yes, obviously.
- I'd like to move on,

04:53.139 --> 04:55.975
unless you have any other
big revelations in here.

04:56.011 --> 04:58.115
Let's see. "From Gomez: Dear Morticia,

04:58.151 --> 04:59.585
I feel so happy when I'm wit' ya."

04:59.621 --> 05:02.023
I was just spit-balling
wedding vows there.

05:02.059 --> 05:04.229
So you said you and Robert
were partners,

05:04.265 --> 05:06.532
but it was Robert's name
on the business, correct?

05:06.568 --> 05:09.206
Yeah. He started the practice
and then I joined after.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.492
Uh, Captain, something's
come up in the case.

05:11.528 --> 05:12.794
Can I talk to you outside for a sec?

05:13.191 --> 05:15.576
What the hell are you doing in there?
You totally undermined me.

05:15.612 --> 05:18.555
I know, and I apologize,
but I'm executing a strategy.

05:18.591 --> 05:20.792
Oh, really, and what
strategy might that be?

05:20.827 --> 05:22.128
Make Jake feel like an idiot,

05:22.163 --> 05:23.821
or make Jake feel self-conscious

05:23.857 --> 05:26.184
about his Addams Family-themed
wedding vows rap?

05:26.220 --> 05:29.040
No, I want Philip to
underestimate you and fear me.

05:29.075 --> 05:31.011
I'll badger him with
my superior intellect,

05:31.046 --> 05:33.148
while simultaneously belittling you.

05:33.183 --> 05:35.083
Once Philip dismisses you as a threat,

05:35.118 --> 05:37.321
I'll leave you alone with him,
and he'll let his guard down.

05:37.356 --> 05:39.359
If I didn't know any better,
I would say you're describing

05:39.394 --> 05:40.815
smart cop/dumb cop.

05:40.851 --> 05:42.964
Look, I thought you had him
on the calendar reveal.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.301
But he was a step ahead.

05:44.336 --> 05:46.237
You got flustered, and I realized

05:46.272 --> 05:48.441
in the moment we could
use this to our advantage.

05:48.476 --> 05:50.277
So what do you want me to do,
ask stupid questions?

05:50.312 --> 05:52.314
Stupid questions, grammatical errors,

05:52.349 --> 05:54.451
lose your train of thought,
just ask him to confess...

05:54.486 --> 05:57.090
ooh, relate everything back
to those movies you've seen.

05:57.125 --> 05:59.126
Kinda seems like a shot at me
about "Die Hard," but okay.

05:59.161 --> 06:01.263
This is not a comment on you, Peralta.

06:01.298 --> 06:02.600
I just want to bring this guy down.

06:02.635 --> 06:04.691
Yeah, that's all I want too.

06:05.205 --> 06:09.111
And to possibly say,
"You can't handle the tooth."

06:09.593 --> 06:10.960
You know, if it comes up naturally.

06:10.996 --> 06:11.983
- It won't.
- It might.

06:12.019 --> 06:14.240
I actually think... it can't.

06:14.651 --> 06:15.918
So what do you say?

06:17.962 --> 06:19.341
Me want to.

06:20.099 --> 06:21.231
- Dumb cop.
- I got that.

06:21.267 --> 06:22.367
- Yeah.
- Well done.

06:22.402 --> 06:24.371
- Mm-hmm.
- So, the night of the murder,

06:24.406 --> 06:26.040
you met with Robert
in the surgical suite.

06:26.075 --> 06:27.376
Why there? Why not your office?

06:27.411 --> 06:29.112
Uh, just preparing for
the next day's surgeries.

06:29.147 --> 06:31.116
Don't you have an assistant
who does that?

06:31.151 --> 06:34.088
I'm a meticulous person.
I'm careful how I do things.

06:34.123 --> 06:35.552
So careful that you...

06:36.293 --> 06:38.362
I'm sorry, I forgot what
I was gonna say.

06:38.397 --> 06:39.633
Come back to me.

06:39.778 --> 06:41.434
Now, we did a sweep of the room

06:41.469 --> 06:42.670
where you and Robert fought.

06:42.705 --> 06:44.104
- Talked.
- Right, talked.

06:44.408 --> 06:46.492
- The entire room had been scrubbed.
- It had been cleaned.

06:46.528 --> 06:48.688
It had undergone
industrial sterilization

06:48.724 --> 06:51.419
to remove all traces of blood and DNA.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.720
It's a surgical suite.

06:52.755 --> 06:54.124
People bleed in there every day.

06:54.159 --> 06:55.559
We have to sanitize it by law.

06:55.594 --> 06:57.426
Ooh, I remembered what I was gonna ask.

06:58.394 --> 06:59.636
- Did you kill him?
- No.

06:59.672 --> 07:01.569
Ah! If you had said yes,
I woulda had you!

07:01.604 --> 07:04.241
So, after you and Robert fought...

07:04.276 --> 07:05.309
- Talked.
- You left the office,

07:05.344 --> 07:06.440
but you didn't take your car?

07:06.476 --> 07:07.944
I went to a bar, The Scotchman.

07:07.980 --> 07:09.882
I didn't want to drive drunk,
so I took a cab.

07:09.918 --> 07:10.862
And you didn't have your phone?

07:10.898 --> 07:12.332
I left it charging in my office

07:12.368 --> 07:14.459
and I didn't realize till I was
already out of the building.

07:14.495 --> 07:16.763
Oh, man, if I go ten minutes
without looking at my phone,

07:16.798 --> 07:18.766
my pumpkin crop dies on my little farm.

07:18.801 --> 07:20.337
This is not the time

07:20.372 --> 07:22.506
for stories about your
digital squash, Peralta.

07:22.541 --> 07:24.210
- Fine.
- Talking about your phone.

07:24.245 --> 07:26.080
Why does it matter that I forgot it?

07:27.750 --> 07:29.787
Ohhh, if I had it on me,

07:29.822 --> 07:31.828
you could've seen it
pinging off the cell tower.

07:31.928 --> 07:33.427
Doesn't matter. Didn't have it on me.

07:33.462 --> 07:35.597
So you took a cab to this bar.

07:35.632 --> 07:37.600
Well, we talked to the
employees of the Scotchman.

07:37.635 --> 07:40.056
- Nobody saw you there.
- Nobody remembers seeing me.

07:40.092 --> 07:42.125
But let me ask you this...
did you kill him?

07:42.161 --> 07:43.630
Nah. You know, it's not surprising

07:43.666 --> 07:45.068
nobody remembers seeing me.

07:45.104 --> 07:47.038
The bar was extremely
crowded that night,

07:47.074 --> 07:48.474
and I spent my whole time in the corner

07:48.510 --> 07:50.154
talking to this woman, Dana.

07:50.190 --> 07:51.154
Oh, so you said.

07:51.190 --> 07:52.859
But when we ran all
the credit card receipts,

07:53.295 --> 07:55.563
nobody named Dana bought
any drinks that night.

07:55.599 --> 07:58.804
Trust me, Dana wasn't
buying her own drinks.

07:58.839 --> 08:00.674
- No?
- No.

08:00.709 --> 08:01.942
Okay.

08:01.978 --> 08:03.571
- Hold on.
- Hm?

08:03.686 --> 08:05.549
I need to deal with this.
Let's take a five.

08:05.584 --> 08:08.520
Or... I could keep this
interview going solo.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.758
Of course. I'm sure that'll be, um...

08:10.793 --> 08:11.980
pretty helpful.

08:12.831 --> 08:15.719
All right. Where should we
start-a-rooski?

08:15.755 --> 08:17.351
Don't you think maybe
we should just wait

08:17.387 --> 08:18.621
till your boss comes back?

08:18.657 --> 08:19.923
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

08:20.208 --> 08:22.111
Because you're scared.

08:22.147 --> 08:23.448
You know I'm playing hardball,

08:23.483 --> 08:25.318
except for that the balls are questions.

08:25.353 --> 08:26.487
And here they come.

08:26.522 --> 08:28.189
What kind of car did Robert drive?

08:28.224 --> 08:29.458
Also, Dana from the bar,
what color was her hair,

08:29.493 --> 08:31.811
and which night does the cleaning crew
sterilize your office,

08:31.847 --> 08:33.275
and have you ever been up
to where the body was found,

08:33.312 --> 08:34.587
and when you left your phone
at the office,

08:34.624 --> 08:36.159
was it plugged into your
computer or an outlet,

08:36.210 --> 08:38.145
and did you kill him, and what
did your cab driver look like?

08:38.181 --> 08:40.724
This seems like a huge waste of time.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.427
But, here you go.

08:42.616 --> 08:44.452
Robert drove a Saab,
Dana's hair was blonde,

08:44.487 --> 08:46.255
they sterilize on Wednesdays
and Saturdays,

08:46.290 --> 08:47.924
I haven't been to Vernon in 20 years,

08:47.959 --> 08:49.673
the phone was plugged into the wall,

08:49.709 --> 08:50.976
no, I didn't kill him,

08:51.012 --> 08:52.558
and the cab driver had a beard
and an earring...

08:52.594 --> 08:54.330
I sorry I didn't get his license number.

08:55.191 --> 08:56.242
Wow.

08:57.410 --> 08:58.776
- Very impressive.
- Yeah.

08:58.811 --> 09:00.780
You didn't fall for my
"did you kill him" gambit.

09:00.815 --> 09:01.581
No.

09:01.814 --> 09:03.345
Although it is interesting that you knew

09:03.381 --> 09:04.837
the body was found in Vernon, New York,

09:04.873 --> 09:07.082
when that information hasn't
been released to the public.

09:10.683 --> 09:14.056
Well, hello, Dolly.

09:16.698 --> 09:17.918
_

09:17.954 --> 09:20.330
I can't believe you thought
I was the dumb cop.

09:20.365 --> 09:21.867
I mean, I've watched "Planet Earth."

09:21.902 --> 09:23.575
With the British narrator.

09:23.611 --> 09:25.573
I can tell you anything
you want to know about

09:25.865 --> 09:27.777
"three-toed slow-ths"

09:27.812 --> 09:29.479
and I got you to say you knew
where the body was found,

09:29.514 --> 09:31.083
which kinda seems like something

09:31.118 --> 09:32.218
only the murderer would've known.

09:32.253 --> 09:34.822
Actually... Robert's wife told me.

09:34.857 --> 09:38.027
I've been talking
with her a lot, comforting her.

09:38.062 --> 09:39.296
We asked her not to share that info,

09:39.331 --> 09:40.999
and she promised us she didn't.

09:41.034 --> 09:42.969
Well, she's been distraught.
She might not remember.

09:43.004 --> 09:45.374
Uh-huh. Flimsy. So what
did you mean when you said

09:45.409 --> 09:47.411
that you hadn't been
to Vernon in 20 years?

09:47.446 --> 09:50.016
My uncle has a cabin there.
I would visit him as a kid.

09:50.051 --> 09:51.985
Wow. So your uncle owns a cabin

09:52.020 --> 09:53.822
in the town that the body was found.

09:53.857 --> 09:55.124
That is quite a coincidence.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.679
I haven't been there for 20 years.

09:56.715 --> 09:58.150
You can call my uncle if you want.

09:58.186 --> 10:00.200
Oh, we are. So you might
as well just confess now,

10:00.235 --> 10:02.464
or we can take our sweet time like...

10:02.665 --> 10:05.034
the mer-jestic slow-th.

10:05.790 --> 10:07.324
Either way, we've got you.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.584
- We don't have him.
- But I just told him we did have him.

10:09.619 --> 10:11.353
Philip's uncle said he hasn't
been to the cabin in months

10:11.388 --> 10:12.863
and he hasn't spoken to Philip
in over a year.

10:12.899 --> 10:14.190
Well, what about the neighbors?

10:14.226 --> 10:15.561
There's only one other house
off that road

10:15.596 --> 10:17.064
and we haven't been able
to contact the owner.

10:17.099 --> 10:19.210
Yeah, but Philip doesn't know that.
He's rattled right now.

10:19.246 --> 10:21.284
We tell him the neighbor saw him
that night, he'll crack for sure.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.975
- So you want us to lie?
- No, I want me to lie

10:24.010 --> 10:25.011
and for you to stand behind me

10:25.046 --> 10:26.247
and say, like, three

10:26.282 --> 10:28.048
<i>oh damn</i> 's when I really get cooking.

10:28.083 --> 10:29.384
All right, fine, two oh-damns.

10:29.419 --> 10:31.522
- One oh-damn?
- There will be no oh-damns.

10:31.557 --> 10:33.492
But it will be so satisfying
in your deep, powerful voice.

10:33.527 --> 10:35.195
- We're not lying.
- It's legal.

10:35.230 --> 10:36.598
The Supreme Court said that
we're allowed to lie

10:36.633 --> 10:37.711
in an interrogation.

10:37.747 --> 10:39.368
I told a perp that I knew
Steph Curry a couple days ago.

10:39.404 --> 10:40.694
It had nothing to do with the case,

10:40.730 --> 10:42.300
- but I could say it.
- It's a tactical mistake.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.643
You're guessing what
happened that night.

10:43.678 --> 10:45.280
But what if Philip never
went to the cabin?

10:45.315 --> 10:47.450
He did. I can feel it here.

10:47.485 --> 10:49.152
- Your stomach?
- No, my gut.

10:49.187 --> 10:50.622
Your gut, or intestines, is lower.

10:50.657 --> 10:52.258
You should point down here,
closer to your pubis.

10:52.293 --> 10:54.094
- I'm good.
- Suppose you're wrong.

10:54.129 --> 10:55.631
Now Philip knows we have nothing.

10:55.666 --> 10:57.634
There goes our credibility
and our leverage.

10:57.669 --> 11:00.011
No, we need a different strategy,

11:00.047 --> 11:02.083
All right, fine. How about this...

11:02.345 --> 11:04.147
I convince him I'm unstable.

11:04.182 --> 11:05.449
I run in there screaming,

11:05.484 --> 11:07.252
I throw a chair through
the two-sided mirror,

11:07.287 --> 11:09.055
glass goes everywhere. He's like,

11:09.090 --> 11:11.124
"If Mad Dog Peralta will do that,

11:11.159 --> 11:12.695
who knows what else he's capable of?"

11:12.730 --> 11:14.465
No offense, but you don't
get angry well.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.567
What? That's not true.
Remember how angry I got

11:16.602 --> 11:18.137
about how fast Daenerys
got from Dragonstone

11:18.172 --> 11:19.138
to north of the Wall?

11:19.173 --> 11:20.141
That was intense.

11:20.176 --> 11:22.177
You have a boyish face
and a big goofy grin.

11:22.212 --> 11:24.328
It's like being yelled at
by a children's cereal mascot.

11:24.364 --> 11:27.363
Hey, some of those are scary.
Count Chocula much?

11:27.399 --> 11:29.559
All right, fine, I see your point.
What do you suggest?

11:29.595 --> 11:31.167
Let's get all up in his personal space.

11:31.203 --> 11:32.950
- Make him feel uncomfortable.
- Okay, fine.

11:34.045 --> 11:35.301
Let's get intimate.

11:35.336 --> 11:36.603
_

11:36.638 --> 11:39.709
So, Philip, you're
hanging out at the bar

11:39.744 --> 11:41.412
with "Dana."

11:41.447 --> 11:42.546
How late did you stay?

11:42.581 --> 11:44.087
I got in the cab around 3:30.

11:44.123 --> 11:45.457
Kinda hard to find
a cab in that neighborhood.

11:45.493 --> 11:46.841
Why not a ride-sharing service?

11:46.877 --> 11:48.110
Didn't have my phone, remember?

11:48.146 --> 11:49.492
- Did you talk to the driver?
- No.

11:49.528 --> 11:50.595
What route did you take?

11:50.631 --> 11:52.198
I don't know, I was watching Taxi TV.

11:52.234 --> 11:53.733
- What was on?
- Fallon highlights.

11:53.769 --> 11:55.604
- What was he doing?
- Slow-jamming the news.

11:55.639 --> 11:57.440
- Who was the guest?
- Amy Adams.

11:57.475 --> 11:59.579
- Who's that?
- Famous actress.

12:00.614 --> 12:02.382
- Why would you...
- Wow.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.319
You got some old silver
fillings in there.

12:04.354 --> 12:06.611
You probably want to drill those out,
replace 'em with porcelain.

12:06.647 --> 12:09.805
- Okay, but why...
- And that is some serious plaque buildup.

12:09.841 --> 12:11.198
- Let's get back to...
- No, no, no.

12:11.234 --> 12:12.604
Open wider. Let me see.

12:13.793 --> 12:15.794
Good God, when is the last time
you had a cleaning?

12:15.830 --> 12:16.831
Damn it!

12:16.867 --> 12:19.469
Not only did we not break him,
but now I have to go to the dentist?!

12:19.847 --> 12:21.516
We need a new strategy.

12:21.551 --> 12:23.386
And all this dental talk

12:23.421 --> 12:24.821
has given me an idea.

12:25.449 --> 12:26.350
- <i>Okay.</i>
- _

12:26.386 --> 12:28.186
We have a few more questions
for you, doctor.

12:28.363 --> 12:30.011
Doctor. Huh.

12:30.634 --> 12:32.801
It's funny when people
call dentists "doctor."

12:32.836 --> 12:33.863
We are doctors.

12:33.899 --> 12:35.266
We do four years of medical school.

12:35.302 --> 12:36.436
Yeah, but it's called "dental school."

12:36.472 --> 12:37.905
But we learn about the entire body.

12:37.941 --> 12:39.844
But if you had cancer,
you wouldn't call a dentist.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.448
You know it's actually harder
to get into dental school

12:41.484 --> 12:42.450
than medical school.

12:42.486 --> 12:44.322
Well, because there
are fewer dental schools.

12:44.625 --> 12:47.360
Because most people want
to become actual doctors.

12:47.395 --> 12:49.830
That's ridiculous. It's not
like we're college professors

12:49.866 --> 12:51.033
calling ourselves "doctors."

12:51.069 --> 12:52.738
- Not the same thing, my friend.
- Well, sure it is.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.474
When someone has a heart attack
on a plane,

12:54.509 --> 12:56.610
do they yell out, "Yo, does anybody
here have an Art History PhD?"

12:56.645 --> 12:59.248
A PhD is a doctorate.

12:59.283 --> 13:01.485
It's literally describing a doctor.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.854
- Maybe let's refocus.
- No!

13:02.889 --> 13:04.358
The problem here is that
medical practitioners

13:04.393 --> 13:06.528
have co-opted the word "doctor."

13:06.563 --> 13:07.730
- Okay, Captain...
- I know we live in a world

13:07.765 --> 13:09.801
where anything can mean anything,

13:09.836 --> 13:12.215
and nobody even cares about etymolo...

13:13.509 --> 13:15.878
Apparently that's a trigger for me.

13:15.913 --> 13:17.496
Yeah, apparently.

13:18.071 --> 13:20.275
So... now can we lie?

13:20.311 --> 13:22.488
No, no. But you know what often works?

13:22.524 --> 13:24.458
Making him confront his victim.

13:24.892 --> 13:26.225
_

13:26.261 --> 13:28.029
Look your dead friend in the eyes

13:28.329 --> 13:29.730
and say his name.

13:29.766 --> 13:30.941
Robert.

13:31.431 --> 13:33.767
Okay, maybe say his full name.

13:33.803 --> 13:35.770
- Robert Tupper.
- His middle name's Henry.

13:35.806 --> 13:36.957
Robert Henry Tupper.

13:36.993 --> 13:38.496
His wife called him Rob. Work that in.

13:38.532 --> 13:40.065
- Rob Tupper.
- Work it into the full name.

13:40.101 --> 13:41.268
Robert "Rob" Henry Tupper.

13:41.304 --> 13:42.724
Now say it with a frown on your face.

13:42.760 --> 13:43.944
Robert "Rob" Henry Tupper.

13:43.980 --> 13:46.014
Now try not to blink,
so tears come to your eyes.

13:46.050 --> 13:47.184
Robert "Rob" Henry Tupper.

13:47.220 --> 13:48.454
Man, this guy is a good murderer!

13:48.490 --> 13:50.307
There's got to be some way to break him.

13:50.343 --> 13:52.449
Wait a minute. I just had an idea.

13:52.485 --> 13:53.585
Two, three, four.

13:59.990 --> 14:02.277
Yeah, I really got to stop
trying that. It never works.

14:04.753 --> 14:05.966
_

14:06.001 --> 14:07.709
Tell us more about your
relationship with Robert.

14:07.745 --> 14:09.238
We've been over this a thousand times.

14:09.274 --> 14:10.382
We got along well.

14:10.418 --> 14:12.253
So you never fought, at all.
About anything.

14:12.289 --> 14:14.621
I mean, we worked together.
We disagreed sometimes.

14:14.657 --> 14:16.167
But we had a good partnership.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.154
He never, for instance, skipped a party

14:18.189 --> 14:21.059
so he could micromanage me
as I tried to do my job.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.361
That's what's happening here, right?

14:22.396 --> 14:24.097
That's why you're wearing the tuxedo?

14:24.132 --> 14:25.701
I skipped the opera,
not a party; it's no big deal.

14:25.736 --> 14:27.169
Yeah, it's the Bugs Bunny one.

14:27.204 --> 14:28.706
And I'm not here to micromanage anyone.

14:28.741 --> 14:30.710
I'm here because I enjoy
interrogating scum.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.144
- Scum like you.
- That was implied.

14:32.179 --> 14:33.306
I just thought we had
a good rhythm going.

14:33.342 --> 14:34.310
- We do.
- I know.

14:34.346 --> 14:35.350
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:35.386 --> 14:36.922
You don't think the fact
that he skipped the opera

14:36.958 --> 14:38.938
has anything to do with
him not believing in you?

14:38.974 --> 14:40.628
He believes in me.

14:40.663 --> 14:43.164
Okay. Why did he make you dumb cop?

14:43.199 --> 14:44.635
He didn't make me dumb cop,

14:44.670 --> 14:46.037
not that it's any of your business.

14:46.072 --> 14:48.140
We agreed on it as a strategy.

14:48.175 --> 14:50.778
Right, but why wasn't he dumb cop?

14:50.813 --> 14:52.346
Please. You never would
have bought that.

14:52.381 --> 14:54.050
- What?
- It's just that, um,

14:54.085 --> 14:57.088
between the two of us,
you are more believable as a...

14:57.123 --> 14:58.424
- Dumb cop?
- Yes, dumb.

14:58.459 --> 15:00.995
Uh, the-the dumber of two smart options.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.161
Wow. Rough.

15:02.197 --> 15:04.167
All right, that's enough.
You're not interrogating us.

15:04.203 --> 15:05.837
- We're interrogating you.
- Exactly.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.106
Tell us about that Diazepam.

15:07.141 --> 15:08.375
If Cheryl didn't take it, then who did?

15:08.410 --> 15:10.111
Because we're pretty sure it was you.

15:10.146 --> 15:12.183
Honestly, it could have been
any one of our employees.

15:12.218 --> 15:14.153
They all have access
to the storage room.

15:14.188 --> 15:16.256
You know, it's silly, but, uh...

15:16.291 --> 15:18.393
I trust the people who work for me.

15:18.428 --> 15:20.029
I'm telling you,
Captain Holt is only in here

15:20.064 --> 15:21.164
because I want him here.

15:21.199 --> 15:22.934
Really? So you're in charge?

15:22.969 --> 15:26.006
And all those strategies you've
been coming after me with,

15:26.041 --> 15:27.141
those were all your ideas?

15:27.176 --> 15:29.112
Right. The guitar thing was mine.

15:29.147 --> 15:30.915
And you signed off on that?

15:30.950 --> 15:32.117
- Well...
- Seriously?

15:32.152 --> 15:34.221
- Ooh, this is sad.
- Shut up.

15:34.256 --> 15:36.024
- I just feel bad for you.
- I said shut up.

15:36.059 --> 15:38.428
Your boss thinks you're
an idiot; that can't feel good.

15:38.463 --> 15:40.098
All right, listen, you son of a bitch,

15:40.133 --> 15:41.266
you think you're smarter than us?

15:41.301 --> 15:42.470
You think you've gotten away with it?

15:42.505 --> 15:44.239
You haven't. We're gonna find something.

15:44.274 --> 15:46.141
One skin cell, one eyelash,

15:46.176 --> 15:48.011
one tiny inconsistency in your story,

15:48.046 --> 15:50.149
and you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in prison.

15:50.184 --> 15:52.120
Everyone who loves you will leave,

15:52.155 --> 15:53.288
and you will die alone!

15:53.323 --> 15:55.324
And at that time, it will be your head

15:55.359 --> 15:56.879
that a bear has sex with!

16:01.570 --> 16:03.539
I'm pretty sure you're going for angry,

16:03.574 --> 16:05.242
but in my mind, it just seems like

16:05.277 --> 16:07.914
when a Muppet gets upset
and starts going like...

16:07.949 --> 16:09.449
Oh, you want angry?

16:09.484 --> 16:11.154
I'll show you angry!

16:14.194 --> 16:15.394
Do you feel like I lost the upper hand?

16:15.429 --> 16:16.929
Because I still think it's about 50/50.

16:16.964 --> 16:18.365
I told you getting angry wouldn't work.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.069
Well, your brilliant ideas
haven't gotten us anywhere either.

16:21.104 --> 16:22.372
I'm telling you, the only thing
that's gonna work

16:22.407 --> 16:23.808
is lying about the cabin.

16:23.843 --> 16:25.410
That would be a huge mistake.

16:25.445 --> 16:27.347
- It'll work.
- No, it will backfire

16:27.382 --> 16:28.918
and jeopardize the entire case.

16:28.953 --> 16:30.553
Oh, so Philip is right,
you don't trust me at all.

16:30.588 --> 16:33.091
Stop it! You know you're
one of my best detectives.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.360
So let me do this my way.

16:34.395 --> 16:36.807
I did. I let you do it your way,

16:36.843 --> 16:38.177
and it was a disaster.

16:38.213 --> 16:39.602
I had to jump in with
the dumb cop gambit

16:39.637 --> 16:41.139
to rescue the interrogation.

16:41.174 --> 16:42.036
I'm sorry.

16:42.072 --> 16:43.140
I know you're frustrated, Peralta.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.851
But the fact is, we don't have enough.

16:44.887 --> 16:46.114
We may not get a confession.

16:46.149 --> 16:47.149
It happens.

16:48.554 --> 16:50.659
You're right.

16:50.934 --> 16:52.146
I'm sorry.

16:52.989 --> 16:55.042
This guy has just really
gotten under my skin.

16:55.078 --> 16:56.946
- Mine too.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom

16:56.982 --> 16:58.213
and try and clear my head.

16:58.249 --> 16:59.754
- I think that's a good idea.
- Good.

17:02.785 --> 17:05.248
Oh, no, Peralta, what are you doing?

17:05.282 --> 17:06.917
Guess what, you dick?

17:06.953 --> 17:08.888
I just got off the phone with Vernon PD.

17:08.924 --> 17:10.424
Oh, no, no, no.

17:10.459 --> 17:11.492
Your uncle's neighbors
saw you go into the cabin

17:11.528 --> 17:12.681
the night of the murder.

17:12.717 --> 17:15.366
They ID'd your photo.
I've got you dead to rights.

17:15.402 --> 17:16.968
Interesting.

17:17.553 --> 17:19.439
But, uh, my uncle only has one neighbor,

17:19.473 --> 17:21.443
and I'm pretty sure
he didn't identify me.

17:21.478 --> 17:23.480
Oh, really? Because you were so careful?

17:23.515 --> 17:25.700
Because he's been dead three years.

17:27.493 --> 17:28.617
Well.

17:29.920 --> 17:32.094
I'm friends with Steph Curry.

17:32.129 --> 17:33.199
So...

17:36.092 --> 17:37.357
_

17:37.705 --> 17:39.373
So, this is how it looks to me.

17:39.408 --> 17:41.326
You were lying in an attempt
to frame my client.

17:41.362 --> 17:43.136
No, no, no, no. Look
Even if we were lying

17:43.172 --> 17:44.606
- about having a witness...
- Which you are.

17:44.642 --> 17:46.606
- The neighbor's dead.
- No, it could've been a squatter

17:46.642 --> 17:49.405
or a hunter or a squatting hunter,
not all hunters have homes...

17:49.441 --> 17:51.455
Peralta's point is, legally,
he can say whatever the hell he wants

17:51.491 --> 17:52.986
- in an interrogation.
- True.

17:53.022 --> 17:55.347
But that doesn't
play so well with juries.

17:55.383 --> 17:57.619
You screwed up, and my client's leaving.

17:57.655 --> 17:59.888
No! He can't leave until I dismiss him.

17:59.924 --> 18:01.559
You've had him for ten hours

18:01.595 --> 18:03.269
and 45 minutes.

18:03.305 --> 18:05.107
15 more and we file a harassment claim.

18:05.143 --> 18:07.413
Great! Then I'll just
keep him for 14 minutes.

18:07.449 --> 18:09.663
Seriously? Just to be childish?

18:09.699 --> 18:10.833
Yuh doy!

18:10.869 --> 18:12.704
I told you not to lie!

18:12.915 --> 18:14.082
What were you thinking?!

18:14.118 --> 18:15.486
I thought it would work.

18:15.522 --> 18:17.256
And I wanted to be the one that got him.

18:17.292 --> 18:18.494
Is this about your ego?

18:18.878 --> 18:20.876
Are you that desperate for everyone
to know how great you are?

18:20.912 --> 18:22.207
It's not about everyone.

18:22.243 --> 18:23.553
Okay? It's just...

18:24.521 --> 18:25.932
I wanted you to know.

18:29.710 --> 18:30.883
Oh, my God.

18:34.764 --> 18:35.873
I got it!

18:37.411 --> 18:38.980
He's not answering any questions.

18:39.016 --> 18:40.382
That's okay. I have no questions.

18:40.418 --> 18:42.383
That's right.
I'm about to monologue, son.

18:42.419 --> 18:44.334
You better make it quick.
You only got eight minutes.

18:44.370 --> 18:45.922
All right, then let me
paint you a picture...

18:45.958 --> 18:47.594
of Philip, a successful periodontist

18:47.630 --> 18:49.065
that's become addicted to Diazepam,

18:49.101 --> 18:50.816
a sedative I take because
I'm junkie scum.

18:50.852 --> 18:52.488
Also, for real, addiction is a disease.

18:52.524 --> 18:54.181
I would be super empathetic
if you hadn't murdered a man.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.688
- What is the point of this?
- I'll get there.

18:55.724 --> 18:58.221
So, one day I'm working late when
my boss Robert surprises me.

18:58.257 --> 18:59.595
He found out I was stealing meds...

18:59.631 --> 19:01.378
again, junkie scum...
also again, not your fault.

19:01.414 --> 19:02.954
There's a major genetic
component to addiction.

19:02.990 --> 19:04.491
He says he's gonna file a police report.

19:04.527 --> 19:05.827
I could lose my license.

19:05.863 --> 19:07.596
We fight, and something
in me just snaps,

19:07.632 --> 19:10.036
so I grab the first thing I can
find, and I hit him with it.

19:10.072 --> 19:11.405
You still have no murder weapon.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.750
I do now. Here's a pic I found on Yelp

19:13.786 --> 19:15.285
of the surgical suite six months ago,

19:15.321 --> 19:17.323
and here is a shot that our
crime scene photographer

19:17.359 --> 19:19.160
took of the same room two weeks
after the murder.

19:19.196 --> 19:20.730
- Notice any differences?
- We're not answering that.

19:20.766 --> 19:22.363
That's all right, I can just
tell you myself.

19:22.399 --> 19:24.547
The Yelp shot has six of these
heavy-looking glass awards

19:24.583 --> 19:26.586
from the Brooklyn Periodontics Society

19:26.622 --> 19:29.259
in the background, whereas
this shot only has five.

19:29.295 --> 19:30.494
What happened to number six?

19:30.707 --> 19:32.342
- Murdered Robert with it!
- I didn't.

19:32.378 --> 19:34.314
You lost all control and you
bludgeoned him to death.

19:34.350 --> 19:36.786
There must have been blood
everywhere, but you got lucky.

19:36.822 --> 19:38.982
You were in the surgical
suite; it can be sterilized.

19:39.018 --> 19:41.078
You never would have gotten away
with it in your carpeted office.

19:41.114 --> 19:42.843
- That's not what happened.
- Don't say anything more, Philip.

19:42.879 --> 19:45.231
And your office manager would
have heard all of the screaming

19:45.267 --> 19:46.923
but she was at her grandson's play.

19:46.959 --> 19:48.230
- Lucky again.
- You're wrong.

19:48.266 --> 19:49.765
You put Robert's body into a wheelchair

19:49.801 --> 19:51.018
and shoved it in the elevator.

19:51.054 --> 19:52.587
It's a miracle there
wasn't blood everywhere.

19:52.623 --> 19:54.686
- That's not true.
- Now you're in the garage with a corpse.

19:54.722 --> 19:56.835
You panicked and left
your phone in your office,

19:56.871 --> 19:57.950
and you don't have your car keys,

19:57.986 --> 20:00.576
but Robert's are in his pocket
so you put him in his car

20:00.612 --> 20:01.808
- and you take off.
- No.

20:01.844 --> 20:03.064
- You can't believe what you've done.
- No.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.169
- Philip.
- You're flustered.

20:04.205 --> 20:05.769
You have no GPS,
so you just start driving.

20:05.805 --> 20:06.899
- No!
- Philip!

20:06.934 --> 20:08.035
Next thing you know,
you're in the Pine Barrens,

20:08.070 --> 20:09.403
and it hits you: your uncle's cabin.

20:09.438 --> 20:10.439
He has a place there.

20:10.474 --> 20:11.623
You're the luckiest son of a bitch...

20:11.659 --> 20:12.564
- It wasn't luck!
- Yes, it was.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.934
- You got lucky at every turn!
- No.

20:14.106 --> 20:15.692
I knew exactly where I was driving,

20:15.728 --> 20:17.696
I left my phone in
the office on purpose,

20:17.732 --> 20:19.234
I was in the surgical suite by design,

20:19.270 --> 20:20.736
and I didn't use some glass award

20:20.772 --> 20:22.742
that any idiot would
clearly see was missing.

20:22.778 --> 20:24.912
I made a rod out
of a special dental polymer,

20:24.948 --> 20:26.884
killed him with it,
then melted it back down.

20:26.920 --> 20:29.512
It's already in a patient's
mouth... son!

20:34.684 --> 20:35.731
Oh, damn.

20:36.036 --> 20:37.170
Oh, damn.

20:37.206 --> 20:39.141
Oh, damn!

20:39.310 --> 20:41.412
And that is three oh-damns.

20:41.795 --> 20:42.940
Oh, damn!

20:45.342 --> 20:48.072
Ohhh. Fresh air.

20:48.900 --> 20:50.488
Wow, I don't say that a lot.

20:50.524 --> 20:53.260
There's one thing I still
don't understand.

20:53.749 --> 20:56.323
Did you know you had
the wrong murder weapon?

20:56.359 --> 20:58.324
Ah, excellent question, sir.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.427
Yes. I spotted the missing dental award

21:00.463 --> 21:01.563
when I first took the case.

21:01.599 --> 21:02.601
I asked around weeks ago.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.669
Turns out a cleaning lady
knocked it over and shattered it.

21:04.705 --> 21:05.966
Then why did you run in there like that?

21:06.002 --> 21:07.302
Because in talking to you,

21:07.338 --> 21:09.495
I realized what Philip's
worst fear actually was:

21:09.531 --> 21:11.784
that we would think he was just
some dummy that got lucky.

21:11.928 --> 21:12.927
Right.

21:13.175 --> 21:14.871
He had planned the perfect crime.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.244
And it killed him when you said
he was sloppy and impulsive.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.913
He needed us to know how smart he was.

21:18.949 --> 21:21.486
Right. Like someone else I know.

21:21.800 --> 21:22.797
Yup.

21:23.079 --> 21:24.347
Kevin.

21:30.312 --> 21:31.457
I'm proud of you, Peralta.

21:32.275 --> 21:33.447
Thank you, sir.

21:34.402 --> 21:36.253
Now let's go get some sleep.

21:36.289 --> 21:37.590
Hey, guys.

21:39.108 --> 21:41.027
My goodness. We're almost late for work.

21:41.063 --> 21:42.931
Oh. Well, in that case,

21:43.128 --> 21:44.362
good morning, sir.

21:44.398 --> 21:45.466
Good morning, Peralta.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.562
God, I love this job.
