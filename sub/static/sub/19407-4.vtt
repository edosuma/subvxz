15:29.961 --> 15:31.730
is that essentially them saying

15:31.763 --> 15:35.066
the A.I. has
some sort of consciousness?

15:35.098 --> 15:38.035
I think we have to separate
consciousness

15:38.068 --> 15:39.904
from the illusion
of consciousness,

15:39.937 --> 15:42.606
because the average user
will start

15:42.640 --> 15:44.775
maybe blurring the lines
in their minds

15:44.808 --> 15:48.045
and feeling like this A.I.
they're talking with is

15:48.078 --> 15:51.683
more alive than it actually is,

17:21.771 --> 17:25.143
Do you think this keeps you
from doing that, Harold?

No, because it
just kind of helps

17:28.612 --> 17:30.582
keep me from being depressed.

17:30.614 --> 17:34.785
So then I guess the only
feedback I would like to give

19:48.035 --> 19:49.771
<i>We'll count this round
as a victory</i>

19:49.804 --> 19:51.305
<i>for human intelligence.</i>

19:51.337 --> 19:53.907
You didn't choose
bachelor number two.

19:53.940 --> 19:55.242
- Now, why is that?
- Right.

19:55.276 --> 19:57.911
I think I was creeped out enough
to be curious...

19:57.944 --> 20:00.080
- Creeped out by...
- But not curious enough.

20:00.113 --> 20:02.350
Let's meet... it.

20:02.382 --> 20:06.219
Rose, bachelor number two is
a completely non-human chat bot

20:06.253 --> 20:07.822
that uses
artificial intelligence

20:07.854 --> 20:09.957
to synthesize
human-like conversations.

20:09.989 --> 20:11.459
Meet Cleverbot.

20:11.491 --> 20:14.428
I'm thrilled that
I did not pick a computer,

20:14.461 --> 20:17.731
combination I-I don't know what
that would mean about myself.

20:17.765 --> 20:19.834
I probably would have had
a heart attack.

20:19.866 --> 20:22.469
<i>So, Cleverbot is zero for one,</i>

20:22.503 --> 20:25.006
<i>but it still has
three more chances.</i>

20:25.038 --> 20:27.709
Now, you take your time,
mull over it.

20:27.741 --> 20:30.243
Bachelor number one, I don't
remember most of your answers,

20:30.276 --> 20:31.478
- which is why...
- Wow.

20:31.511 --> 20:33.146
- I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

20:33.180 --> 20:34.390
So it's actually
between two and three.

20:34.414 --> 20:35.982
How did that happen?

20:36.016 --> 20:37.060
<i>[drum roll]
This time Cleverbot is</i>

20:37.084 --> 20:38.085
<i>in the running.</i>

20:38.119 --> 20:39.821
Okay, um...

20:39.853 --> 20:40.864
I've dated someone
like number two,

20:40.888 --> 20:42.356
so we should just go no.

20:42.389 --> 20:45.226
So we are gonna go with I think
bachelor number three.

20:45.258 --> 20:46.360
Let's meet him.

20:46.392 --> 20:47.828
- Oh, my God!
- [both laughing]

20:47.862 --> 20:49.764
- Hello, how are you?
- Hi.

20:49.796 --> 20:52.432
You did not choose
bachelor number two.

20:52.466 --> 20:54.969
Bachelor number two,
like, what happened?

20:55.001 --> 20:56.146
I didn't even know
you were here.

20:56.170 --> 20:58.005
I thought you were
drunk somewhere.

20:58.037 --> 21:00.240
This is a mess, just a mess!
[both laughing]

21:00.274 --> 21:03.044
Completely a...
[both laughing]

21:03.076 --> 21:04.277
Bachelor number two is

21:04.311 --> 21:06.481
a completely non-human
chat bot...

21:06.514 --> 21:07.915
[both laughing]

21:07.948 --> 21:09.517
That uses
artificial intelligence

21:09.549 --> 21:12.052
to synthesize
human-like conversation.

21:12.085 --> 21:14.188
- Oh, my God.
- Say hi to Cleverbot.

21:14.220 --> 21:15.957
Oh, Cleverbot, you're the worst.

21:15.989 --> 21:18.492
[both laughing]
I almost chose Cleverbot!

21:18.526 --> 21:20.193
This is terrible.

21:20.227 --> 21:22.863
You dated someone that was
a mess like Cleverbot?

21:22.896 --> 21:24.073
That's not speaking well
for him.

21:24.097 --> 21:25.932
[laughter]

21:25.966 --> 21:27.901
- Oh, I hope he's watching.
- Yeah.

21:27.934 --> 21:30.270
<i>It seems Cleverbot has passed
for being human,</i>

21:30.304 --> 21:32.273
<i>but it hasn't won any hearts.</i>

21:32.305 --> 21:35.142
<i>Still, it has two chances left.</i>

21:35.176 --> 21:37.145
Think about the answers
that you've gotten.

21:37.178 --> 21:38.446
Well... [groans]

21:38.478 --> 21:40.782
Bachelor number one,
I didn't see

21:40.815 --> 21:42.984
anything interesting
with the answers,

21:43.017 --> 21:45.385
and Bachelor two
sounds hilarious.

21:45.419 --> 21:48.555
Comedy over looks is
a huge thing for me.

21:48.588 --> 21:50.857
It sounds like
if he went on a date,

21:50.891 --> 21:52.893
it would be at least fun.

21:52.927 --> 21:54.838
You know what? Are you ready
to give us your answer?

21:54.862 --> 21:56.564
[laughs] I mean,
I think I'm ready, yeah.

21:56.596 --> 22:00.300
I'm just really intrigued by...
By bachelor two.

22:00.334 --> 22:01.410
<i>[musical fanfare]</i>
All right!

22:01.434 --> 22:03.470
- Bachelor number two.
- Okay.

22:03.504 --> 22:05.573
Excellent choice.
Why?

22:05.605 --> 22:07.974
- I'm intrigued.
I love humor.

22:08.007 --> 22:10.844
The answers were just funny.
I mean, playful.

22:10.878 --> 22:15.516
This person's mysterious,
like a fully functioning human,

22:15.548 --> 22:18.185
right, 'cause he has
arms and legs and stuff.

22:18.219 --> 22:20.822
Let's meet... it.

22:20.854 --> 22:22.856
- Huh?
- Bachelor number two

22:22.890 --> 22:25.193
is a completely non-human
chat bot

22:25.226 --> 22:26.594
that uses
artificial intelligence

22:26.626 --> 22:28.962
to synthesize
human-like conversations.

22:28.996 --> 22:30.931
- Okay.
- Say hi to Cleverbot.

22:30.965 --> 22:32.567
Like, it was
seriously answering?

22:32.600 --> 22:34.135
- The robot was answering the...
- Yes.

22:34.168 --> 22:35.603
Seriously verbatim.

22:35.635 --> 22:37.537
It's a deep neural network
that learns

22:37.571 --> 22:39.207
- and can synthesize human speech.
- Yes.

22:39.239 --> 22:41.075
So my new type is a robot?

22:41.107 --> 22:43.610
I mean, things are changing
in this world, right?

22:43.643 --> 22:45.613
Both: Yeah.
- This will be

22:45.645 --> 22:48.048
not really a joke in the future.

22:48.082 --> 22:51.084
That is scary, actually.

22:51.117 --> 22:53.421
<i>- The future of A.I.
- might be scary for some,</i>

22:53.453 --> 22:56.089
<i>but even so, this subject wasn't</i>

22:56.123 --> 22:58.625
<i>the only one
who chose the computer.</i>

22:58.659 --> 23:01.228
Bachelor number two,
I'm gonna choose you.

23:01.261 --> 23:03.296
- Wow!
- Okay, Bachelor number two.

23:03.330 --> 23:05.566
I think he might be
the weirdo that I'm looking for.

23:05.598 --> 23:07.567
<i>Cleverbot managed
to win the hearts</i>

23:07.601 --> 23:11.205
<i>of two bachelorettes,
passing not only as human</i>

23:11.238 --> 23:14.107
<i>but also as "datable".</i>

23:14.141 --> 23:15.484
- That concludes...
- [both laughing]

23:15.508 --> 23:18.112
"Let's Get...
both: "RomanTech."

23:18.144 --> 23:19.312
All right.

23:19.345 --> 23:22.282
[cheers and applause]

23:26.253 --> 23:29.924
Maybe computers will have
rights like humans someday.

23:29.957 --> 23:32.627
<i>Maybe we'll never know
what makes human minds</i>

23:32.660 --> 23:35.129
different from electronic ones.

23:35.161 --> 23:36.596
Maybe the question isn't,

23:36.630 --> 23:39.367
"Can we have relationships
with technology,"

23:39.400 --> 23:42.003
<i>but rather,
"Are we the same thing?"</i>

23:42.036 --> 23:46.407
I mean, imagine an alien who has
no concept of the human body

23:46.440 --> 23:49.075
<i>seeing me for the first time.</i>

23:49.109 --> 23:50.511
Would it understand the line

23:50.544 --> 23:54.081
between the organism
and the invention?

23:54.113 --> 23:57.617
Would it know that these were
made for me by other humans,

23:57.651 --> 24:00.587
or would it think that
they just grow out of me?

24:00.621 --> 24:03.457
Would it think
that my phone or my computer

24:03.489 --> 24:08.628
<i>are devices or external
metal organs I evolved?</i>

24:08.661 --> 24:13.233
Years from now, will computers
attain personhood

24:13.267 --> 24:18.972
or are we all collectively
attaining "cyborghood"?

24:19.006 --> 24:21.976
And as always,
thanks for watching.
