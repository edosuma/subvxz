WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:04.373
Great job on the
care package, team.

00:04.671 --> 00:06.378
Yeah. It's really gonna help
Penny get over the breakup

00:06.673 --> 00:07.959
and her post-Pete-m
depression.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.373
(CHUCKLES)
(CHUCKLES)

00:09.676 --> 00:11.041
And before you ask, yes,
|'ve already trademarked that.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.756
Welp, instead of
a care package,

00:13.055 --> 00:15.137
| made Penny
a "dare" package.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.888
Yep. It's a list daring her
to live life to the fullest.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.424
So you spent no money.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.388
"Laugh out loud in a
library." (CHUCKLES)

00:20.687 --> 00:21.722
"Makeover a nerd
to win a bet." Hmm.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.262
"Have brunch
with a rabbi."

00:23.565 --> 00:24.600
Ooh, I'd have brunch
with a rabbi.

00:24.900 --> 00:25.890
Maybe someone'll
finally teach me

00:26.193 --> 00:27.729
how to properly
slice a bagel.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.894
Okay. So who's gonna help me
bring this over to Penny's?

00:30.197 --> 00:30.937
Not me.
| got a thing.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.354
Who's Penny?
Come on.

00:32.658 --> 00:33.989
It's not gonna
be that bad.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.240
Are you kidding?
She's already three days

00:35.536 --> 00:37.447
into her post-breakup
cocooning process.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.362
Right now, she's living out
of her bed, binge eating...

00:39.665 --> 00:41.702
| made the mistake
of going in too soon once.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.661
Pen, I know you're still sad
'cause Robert broke up with you,

00:43.961 --> 00:44.621
so I brought you some...
(GASPS)

00:46.338 --> 00:47.169
(SNARLING)

00:48.090 --> 00:49.205
(GASPING)

00:49.508 --> 00:50.919
Max! Max!

00:51.218 --> 00:51.753
(ROARS) Max!

00:53.011 --> 00:54.376
Haven't eaten
pancakes since.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.169
You're eating
pancakes now.

00:56.265 --> 00:57.881
Huh? Oh.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.218
Haven't eaten
waffles since.

00:59.518 --> 01:00.804
Nope. Eatin' those, too. Okay.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.185
Oh. Guys, I gotta
get my life together.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.436
Yeah, you do!
(LAUGHS) You're a mess.

01:04.730 --> 01:05.766
MAX: I'm a mess.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.023
Hey, kids.
It's back! Shoot it!

01:08.318 --> 01:11.106
Wound it! Shoot it! Oh.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.440
Hey, Pen. You look
amazing. What gives?

01:12.739 --> 01:14.605
| feel great.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.445
| guess I didn't need to cocoon
because | broke up with Pete.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.781
So I've just been enjoying
some much needed "me" time.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.071
For example, I've gotten
back to my theater roots.

01:22.374 --> 01:23.535
| wrote a play.

01:23.834 --> 01:24.995
JANE: Oh.
MAX: Oh.

01:25.294 --> 01:26.625
| didn't know that was in
your... MAX: That's something.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.536
Well, I guess I'll go back
to my theater viewing roots

01:28.839 --> 01:30.045
and I'll sleep through
your play.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.206
Aw! You'll come!
Thank you!

01:32.509 --> 01:34.796
Oh! You didn't realize that
| was trying to insult you!

01:35.095 --> 01:37.052
You can't insult me because I
know that beneath your soft exterior

01:37.347 --> 01:38.257
there's an even
softer interior.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.344
Soft exterior.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.054
You got them thangs.
Everybody knows that.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.138
Oh.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.394
Aw.

01:45.689 --> 01:46.394
Is this the play?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.825
Huh. That was from Pen.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.031
You know, she really seems
like she's doing well.

02:02.331 --> 02:03.696
Breakups are tough,

02:03.999 --> 02:05.740
but what she did was a strong
move by a strong woman.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.704
She's basically
Mary J. Blige.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.539
Now are we talking emotionally
strong like Mary J. Blige,

02:10.839 --> 02:12.546
or physically strong
like Mary J. Blige?

02:12.841 --> 02:14.331
"Cause MJB looks like she
could throw up some plates.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.217
Oh, I bet she could
carry me like a baby.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.922
Well, I gotta go.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.339
Um, I found a store that carries
low-carb edible underwear.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.849
No, it's not for sex.
It's just a great snack.

02:24.144 --> 02:24.975
(KISSES FINGERS)

02:25.270 --> 02:26.010
Zesty ranch.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.178
Don't do that.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.346
It's my fave.

02:28.649 --> 02:29.730
That's disgusting.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.060
Just get some
zesty ranch chips.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.772
Sorry to interrupt,
but I'm Brandon Tyverson.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.904
| work for a company that
specializes in guerilla marketing.

02:37.199 --> 02:39.281
Would you all be interested
in becoming tastemakers?

02:39.576 --> 02:42.238
Hold up. So we come up with a
taste, you make it, and we get paid?

02:42.537 --> 02:43.402
Super Chicken. Go.

02:43.705 --> 02:44.991
Almond Sweat. Go.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.155
Pretzel Cheese. Go.

02:46.458 --> 02:47.573
Falafel Paste. Go.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.038
No, no, no.
See, uh...

02:50.337 --> 02:53.500
People have become cynical
about traditional advertising.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.631
My company pays
real folks like you

02:55.926 --> 02:58.634
to promote our products
in a more natural way.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.795
Dude, if you can't make
Super Chicken, it's cool.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.930
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So
I've watched your group.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.431
| think you guys would
be perfect.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.467
You're hip.
You're diverse.

03:06.770 --> 03:07.976
You're like a fresh
new take on a gay guy.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.353
Yeah, with fresh new takes
on life...

03:10.649 --> 03:12.606
White chocolate?
Better than dark.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.359
Texting while driving?
Sorry, I have friends.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.691
Rihanna and Chris Brown?
| get it, RiRIi.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.071
Good stuff. Well, we'd
love to hire you guys

03:20.367 --> 03:21.482
and your friend, that
tall blonde that just left.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.241
Would she be interested?

03:23.537 --> 03:24.151
Would we have to split
the money three ways?

03:24.454 --> 03:25.865
Yes.
Then, no.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.781
Max, I can't ice out my sister
just to make a few extra bucks.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.574
Alex, last month you paid
your store's rent

03:30.877 --> 03:31.787
by showing your landlord
your feet.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.875
(DEEP VOICE) I'm in.

03:35.173 --> 03:35.787
(TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY)

03:36.091 --> 03:37.081
Was that my phone?

03:37.384 --> 03:38.545
Uh, no,
unless your ringtone is

03:38.844 --> 03:40.585
the incomparable
Joe Gordon-Levitt

03:40.887 --> 03:42.798
carrying this episode
of 3rd Rock from the Sun.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.634
Ugh. Sorry. I'm waiting
for Derrick to call.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.970
His theater group might
put up my play.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.725
Have you guys heard of
the Steppenwolf Theater?

03:49.020 --> 03:50.181
Hell, yeah!
Of course!

03:50.480 --> 03:51.595
Then you should be able
to find Derrick's theater.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.013
It's right around
the corner from that

03:53.316 --> 03:55.057
and above a pho restaurant.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.068
Pen, if you want, I'd be happy to
give you my thoughts on your play.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.524
As you might recall,

03:59.823 --> 04:00.984
| was a theater critic
for my college paper.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.159
"Brigadoon'?
More like 'Briga-don't."™

04:05.454 --> 04:07.115
Damn it. Why didn't |
come up with that then?

04:07.414 --> 04:09.576
OI' Brad was a bit
of a theater guy, too.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.583
When I was a kid, | was in an
all-white production of The Wiz.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.368
No one really
eased on down the road.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.581
It was more of a stiff,
uncoordinated lumbering.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.540
Love-ing it!

04:19.843 --> 04:21.379
Really? So you're
gonna put the play on?

04:21.678 --> 04:23.294
No. I drove all the way here,
didn't like what I had on,

04:23.597 --> 04:24.883
went home to change,
stopped at the new whole foods

04:25.182 --> 04:26.798
so I could peep the crazy
ripped Guatemalan stock boy,

04:27.100 --> 04:29.137
just so I could come here
and tell you | won't put it on.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.801
(CHUCKLES) So does that mean
you're putting it on or not?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.390
Yes, you stupid,
clumsy bitch!

04:32.689 --> 04:33.554
(GASPS) Yay!

04:33.857 --> 04:35.097
(GLASS SHATTERS)
Aah!

04:35.400 --> 04:38.233
(LAUGHING)
Stupid, clumsy bitch!

04:38.528 --> 04:39.814
(LAUGHING)
She's so stupid.

04:40.113 --> 04:40.818
(LAUGHING) You're a clumsy
bitch and you're so stupid!

04:41.114 --> 04:42.229
Clumsy and stupid!
Okay.

04:42.532 --> 04:43.397
(STOMPING FEET)

04:43.700 --> 04:44.690
Oh! I love you.

04:45.869 --> 04:46.950
You're the worst.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.906
(LAUGHS)

04:49.206 --> 04:52.244
Check out all this cool stuff
Brandon sent us to sell.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.158
(GASPS)
| mean, spearmint scotch,

04:54.461 --> 04:56.543
lens-less glasses,

04:56.838 --> 04:57.999
this super cool conditioning
mist for your hair.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.547
Hey, guys.
(GASPS)

05:00.842 --> 05:02.003
| just came to see
if you've heard from Penny.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.588
Great cover.

05:03.887 --> 05:04.843
What's in the box?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.720
Oh, you know,
just box stuff.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.097
Oh. So you're not trying to
be a tastemaker with Alex?

05:09.392 --> 05:11.929
Ugh! You and your
ability to read.

05:12.229 --> 05:12.969
Look, after you left
Rosalita's... (SIGHS)

05:13.271 --> 05:15.262
...we were approached
by a marketing guy,

05:15.565 --> 05:16.726
and he asked us
if we wanted to do it.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.231
Ooh! Can I do it
with you guys?

05:18.527 --> 05:20.063
Oh, Jane.

05:20.362 --> 05:23.571
You're a great person,
salt of the dang earth.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.776
Mmm. But a tastemaking
trendsetter ya ain't.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.738
(CHUCKLES) Oh. Okay.

05:29.037 --> 05:32.826
When I was in third grade, | created
a new in/outbox homework system.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.081
It was the talk of the
school. Even got interviewed.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.493
Granted, it was from
the school psychologist,

05:37.796 --> 05:39.582
who was concerned that an 8-year-old
would spend every recess creating it.

05:39.881 --> 05:43.090
But that does not mean it
wasn't a super efficient system.

05:43.385 --> 05:44.546
(WHISPERS)
And it would've caught on.

05:44.845 --> 05:45.835
Wow.
(INHALES DEEPLY)

05:46.137 --> 05:49.004
Moving stuff, Jane.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.765
But the fact is, Max and I
are so far down the road

05:52.060 --> 05:52.765
on this tastemaking thing.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.893
| mean...

05:55.188 --> 05:56.394
We've already
opened the box.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.226
And we love you, but
the wheels are in motion.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.641
And once the bus starts,
it's hard to make it stop.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.936
Fine. | don't wanna be
tastemakers with you losers anyway.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.604
(OPENS AND SLAMS DOOR)

06:05.907 --> 06:07.363
Oof.

06:07.659 --> 06:10.321
Angry storm outs are
trending so low right now.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.827
Suh low.
So low.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.241
Oh, thank you so much for
coming to a reading of my play.

06:16.543 --> 06:17.578
| look forward
to your feedback,

06:17.878 --> 06:19.915
as long as it's
constructive, honest,

06:20.213 --> 06:21.248
and tells me everything
in my play is perfect.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.504
Sounds good?

06:22.799 --> 06:23.880
(LOWERED VOICE)
What are you doin'?

06:24.175 --> 06:25.210
(LOWERED VOICE) I'm just
giving these a little test run.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.842
| wanna see if this
tastemaking thing is legit.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.924
Max, are you seriously
wearing glasses with no lenses?

06:31.433 --> 06:32.639
Maybe.
Dude, I've seen you do

06:32.934 --> 06:34.845
some really dumb
things before, but this...

06:35.145 --> 06:36.055
is not one of them.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.594
Those are cool.

06:37.898 --> 06:38.933
And this is coming
from a guy

06:39.232 --> 06:41.439
who wore a bandana around
his jeans leg in high school,

06:41.735 --> 06:43.317
so I know what
| speak of.

06:43.612 --> 06:44.852
(PENNY CLEARS THROAT)
ALEX: Yes!

06:45.155 --> 06:47.317
And now let us begin
our journey.

06:47.616 --> 06:50.153
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present you...

06:50.452 --> 06:53.240
Black Plague: A Love Story.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.869
Now we will be holding
auditions in two days,

06:55.165 --> 06:58.408
but for tonight, you
guys will be my actors.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.826
Brad, will you honor us
by playing the role of Clete?

07:01.129 --> 07:02.415
Clete?
Clete...

07:02.714 --> 07:05.832
is a very interesting name.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.250
Clete is the very attractive,
well-meaning young man

07:08.553 --> 07:10.464
who's about to ask the
love of his life to marry him.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.629
Jane.
Oh. Yeah?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.969
"Clete" rhymes
with "Pete."

07:14.267 --> 07:16.053
Just a real eagle eye there,
Alex. (CLICKS TONGUE)

07:16.353 --> 07:18.560
And I will be playing the
role of the Black Plague.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.392
The evil, malignant
foe of love,

07:21.691 --> 07:24.774
intent on destroying the earnest
heart of the unsuspecting Clete.

07:25.070 --> 07:25.855
TOGETHER: Oh, boy.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.940
Okay.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.947
Wait, Penny wrote a play about a guy
who's about to get his heart ripped out?

07:31.242 --> 07:32.198
Yeah.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.154
Is this about Dave?

07:34.120 --> 07:34.780
Sure.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.495
BRAD: "I'm ruined.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.786
"The Plague came to me
disguised as a gentle breeze,

"| hate you, Plague!"

07:48.343 --> 07:50.380
"And I deserve that hate.

"| destroy love

07:53.181 --> 07:54.342
"That's what I do."

07:55.392 --> 07:56.848
The end.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.133
What'd you guys think?

07:58.436 --> 07:59.597
Uh... um...

07:59.896 --> 08:00.852
um...

08:01.147 --> 08:03.058
Really interesting.

08:03.358 --> 08:04.439
You know?
And that makes me think,

08:04.734 --> 08:06.190
did you come up
with this randomly or...

08:06.486 --> 08:07.442
(INHALES DEEPLY)

08:07.737 --> 08:09.068
Or is it personal, or...

08:09.364 --> 08:10.274
Why? What...
What are you saying?

08:10.573 --> 08:12.109
Well, Pen, I mean,

08:12.409 --> 08:14.867
your character destroys the heart
of a man named Clete. (EXHALES)

08:15.161 --> 08:17.573
Guys, it's a character.

08:17.872 --> 08:21.410
Would you ask Anthony Hopkins
if he were really a cannibal?

08:21.710 --> 08:23.667
Would you ask Tom Hanks if
he owns Bubba Gump Shrimp?

08:23.962 --> 08:25.794
Although, I think
he actually does.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.625
| think he got a very healthy
piece of the backend merch.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.837
The point is, I have poured
my heart and soul and artistry

08:31.136 --> 08:33.047
into this creative endeavor,

08:33.346 --> 08:34.256
and the least you guys
could do is be supportive.

08:35.097 --> 08:35.837
Ooh.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.888
(SIGHS) Well, I think it's
pretty obvious why she's upset.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.394
She must know that that second
act has some real problems.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.055
| mean, Black Plague?

08:45.358 --> 08:46.473
More like Hack Plague.
Am I right?

08:46.776 --> 08:48.437
ALEX: Yeah.

08:48.737 --> 08:49.818
(LOWERED VOICE) Black
Plague-Hack Plague. Don't forget it.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.148
(CLICKS BUTTON)
Whoa. What was that?

08:51.448 --> 08:52.654
What is it? What's
happening? What is that?

08:52.949 --> 08:55.065
That's a recorder. You don't
have to tell yourself not to forget it.

08:55.368 --> 08:55.903
You're already doing that.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.072
BRAD: Wow. Unbelievable.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.036
And this is all because of Alex
and Max's conditioning mist?

09:04.335 --> 09:05.575
(EXHALES) This is
amazing. (LAUGHS)

09:05.879 --> 09:07.540
| know. The guy
at the guitar store said

09:07.839 --> 09:09.580
| had the hair
of a white Aziz Ansairi.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.044
He's not wrong.

09:11.342 --> 09:11.922
Mmm.
(WHISPERS) Wow.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.501
Sadly, this is
not weird anymore.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.465
Oh. Honey. Um...
(DOOR CLOSES)

09:16.765 --> 09:18.051
Why aren't you at lunch
with Penny?

09:18.349 --> 09:19.931
She canceled.
| think she's avoiding me.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.307
| think she's avoiding
everyone.

09:21.603 --> 09:22.934
She's not even
Instagraming anymore.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.470
She hasn't posted a picture
of an appetizer all week.

09:25.774 --> 09:26.514
I'm really concerned
about her.

09:26.816 --> 09:27.931
(WHISPERS) Yeah.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.941
| mean, she has clearly
not dealt with this breakup.

09:30.236 --> 09:30.976
Someone's gotta
get through to her.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.861
Yeah.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.739
Maybe if a couple of guys who've
had a rough breakup talk to her,

09:36.034 --> 09:37.741
she'd realize that
Pete's gonna be fine.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.151
Oh, yeah. | can
handle that. Yeah.

09:39.454 --> 09:40.865
| got dumped by a girl
in high school,

09:41.164 --> 09:42.950
licked my wounds, got way
into anime, and moved on.

09:43.249 --> 09:46.116
And I had no problem getting
over the whole Alex thing,

09:46.419 --> 09:48.205
especially once we
got back together.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.291
Yeah, that...
So that... Yeah.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.627
Um, I think Brad should
maybe take the lead on this.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.542
You could come in and
then bounce it back to Brad,

09:54.844 --> 09:56.130
and then maybe
don't talk at all.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.009
(MOUTHS WORD)
Yeah.

09:58.848 --> 09:59.383
Dive right back
into there.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.013
Get in there.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.266
Don't be afraid
to go deep. Nice.

10:03.561 --> 10:04.426
Let me see those eyebrows.
They're pretty good.

10:04.729 --> 10:05.685
Ooh, they're nice.

10:05.980 --> 10:06.811
How about that goatee?

10:07.107 --> 10:09.439
No one touches
the goatee.

10:10.735 --> 10:11.315
(WHISPERS) Right.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.564
Excuse me.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.774
| don't normally
do this, but,

10:16.074 --> 10:18.315
you have the hair of a Greek
shipping magnate's worthless son.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.655
Thanks.
| get that a lot.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.319
And that's because
| use

10:22.622 --> 10:24.112
this awesome
conditioning mist.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.280
Wow.
(SPRITZES)

10:25.583 --> 10:26.163
Hey, is that stuff
really good?

10:26.459 --> 10:27.745
Oh, it's better
than good.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.159
It's fantastic.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.293
| wouldn't use that
if I were you.

10:31.965 --> 10:32.796
Just a heads-up.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.422
Name's Devin.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.299
Yeah, I'm a girl
with a boy's name.

10:36.594 --> 10:37.925
I'm a bit of a trendsetter
that way.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.552
Devin.

10:39.848 --> 10:40.758
What's wrong
with the mist?

10:41.057 --> 10:42.718
It seeps in
through your pores,

10:43.017 --> 10:44.052
loosens up your bones.

10:44.352 --> 10:45.387
You want loose bones?

10:45.687 --> 10:46.427
You wanna be like a...
| don't.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.345
A drunk marionette?

10:48.648 --> 10:49.888
Don't listen to her. She
obviously has mental problems.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.057
Yeah, 'cause I used
the conditioning mist.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.146
(IMITATES IRISH ACCENT) And
now me skull can't hold me brain right.

10:54.445 --> 10:55.355
(HAND THUDS)
MAX: What are you doing?

10:55.655 --> 10:56.611
Stop that, Jane! Stop it! What?

10:56.906 --> 10:58.021
ALEX: Your bones
are fine, Jane!

10:58.324 --> 10:59.439
And why are you
Irish now?

10:59.742 --> 11:02.575
This is weird.
You're weird. Get out.

11:02.871 --> 11:03.702
Dog darn it!
What the heck?

11:03.997 --> 11:05.613
Jane, why are you
sabotaging us?

11:05.915 --> 11:07.371
(NORMAL VOICE)
| am not gonna stand by

11:07.667 --> 11:09.499
while you guys prey on
the gullibility of the public.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.626
You are no better
than Bernie Madoff

11:11.921 --> 11:13.207
or that guy who started
Earth Day. (SCOFFS)

11:13.506 --> 11:14.871
| don't know how you
guys live with yourselves.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.040
Do you wanna be
a tastemaker with us?

11:16.342 --> 11:17.082
Yes!

11:18.178 --> 11:19.213
(WHISPERS) Yes!

11:19.512 --> 11:20.843
(SPRITZING)
It's so pathetic, Jane.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.595
(COUGHS) | can
see right through you.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.552
| don't want comedians.
| want actors.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.808
Hey, Pen.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.891
We wanted to talk to you
guy to girl, mano y manette,

11:30.190 --> 11:32.306
about how your play is
maybe sort of a metaphor

11:32.609 --> 11:34.065
for your relationship
and such.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.067
Ooh. I would love
nothing more

11:36.362 --> 11:38.103
than to unpack the
subtext of my work,

11:38.406 --> 11:39.521
even though you
couldn't be more wrong.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.940
But I kinda gotta
finish auditions.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.859
We're having a really
hard time finding a Clete.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.995
No, Penny! This is serious.
We're worried about you.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.530
You need to find a healthy way
to deal with your breakup.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.282
Oh, my God.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.413
(SIGHS)

11:52.712 --> 11:53.668
You couldn't
be more right.

11:53.963 --> 11:54.794
(WHISPERS) Yes.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.375
For the role of Clete.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.090
That passion,

11:59.385 --> 12:01.001
the raw manness,
the... (GROWLS)

12:01.304 --> 12:02.840
What?
What?

12:03.139 --> 12:05.346
| don't know why |
didn't see this at the read.

12:05.642 --> 12:06.632
Where was that
at the read?

12:06.935 --> 12:08.050
(GIGGLES) I don't know.

12:08.353 --> 12:08.683
Girl, what you doing
back there?

12:08.978 --> 12:10.514
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.474
Now, you have theater
experience, is that correct?

12:12.774 --> 12:14.230
Well, I mean...

12:14.525 --> 12:15.890
| haven't really kept up
with my acting.

12:16.194 --> 12:17.901
| mean, aside from
memorizing every one

12:18.196 --> 12:19.982
of Taye Diggs' monologues
from Private Practice.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.316
But that's just to stay
sharp, and... (CHUCKLES)

12:21.616 --> 12:22.401
Damn it, Penny,
that's not the point!

12:22.700 --> 12:23.565
There it is again.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.529
That is so Clete.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.034
Brad, you must do this role.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.536
Penny, no!

12:28.831 --> 12:30.413
| will not do this role.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.164
| will define it.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.076
Wait a minute. Wait.
This is insane.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.245
All right, this is insane.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.878
What about me?

12:38.174 --> 12:39.585
You know I love the theater.
What can I do?

12:39.884 --> 12:41.124
| have the perfect role
for you.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.461
Head stage tech?

12:44.764 --> 12:47.597
Dave, you're such a
student of the theater.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.350
Who better to create
the visual and audio palette

12:50.645 --> 12:51.851
to make my play pop?

12:52.647 --> 12:54.183
Please?

12:54.482 --> 12:56.723
| don't want another
"briga-don't" on my hands.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.395
Okay.

12:59.237 --> 13:00.022
I'll briga-do it.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.606
(WHISPERS) Briga-do it.
Okay.

13:04.909 --> 13:08.322
(DESCENDING FOOTSTEPS)
All right. Let's make some taste.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.079
Now, I have a couple
notes on the script.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.739
Take it easy, noob.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.374
We've been doing this
for literally days.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.957
You're right. | don't
have to be in charge,

13:18.256 --> 13:19.371
even though it's
better when I am.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.415
Walk me through it.
It's simple.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.379
We tell Brandon what products
we need and send him a check.

13:23.678 --> 13:24.793
Then he sends us
the goods.

13:25.096 --> 13:25.710
We go out, we tell
everyone how cool they are,

13:26.014 --> 13:26.845
and then he pays us.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.426
Cool, cool, cool.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.682
Can we just circle
back to the part

13:30.977 --> 13:33.093
where you pay Brandon
for the products?

13:33.396 --> 13:34.932
Well, he's not just gonna
give it to us for free, Jane.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.972
Sometimes you are
such a blonde.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.857
Oh. Okay. (CHUCKLES)

13:39.152 --> 13:41.985
How much have you paid him
for the products so far?

13:42.280 --> 13:43.270
2,500 bucks.
Oh, okay.

13:43.573 --> 13:44.688
How much has he paid you?

13:44.991 --> 13:48.074
$373 a-pure a-profit.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.859
Tic-tac-toe.
Tic-tac-toe.

not understand business.

all those cars at her work

14:03.468 --> 14:05.425

14:07.847 --> 14:09.178
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

14:13.186 --> 14:15.803
All right, check it out. In order
to truly inhabit the role of Clete,

14:16.105 --> 14:18.187
I'm going method and living
as if I'm in the 1300s.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.269
All right?
Fun fact, I am property.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.400
Hey, guys,
couple quick tweaks.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.981
Brad, in the scene
where Clete calls me

14:24.280 --> 14:26.317
"a foul,
heartless scourge,”

14:26.616 --> 14:29.699
could you add the words "selfish"
and "vomitous” before "foul"?

14:29.994 --> 14:31.075
Uh...
PENNY: Thanks, bud.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.782
And, Dave,
when I first enter,

14:33.081 --> 14:35.413
could you pipe some type of
noxious smell into the audience?

14:35.708 --> 14:36.994
Like a quarter-pound
of shrimp

14:37.293 --> 14:39.409
you forgot was in your
baby's diaper kind of thing?

14:39.712 --> 14:42.921

be sickened by very sight of me.

Cool beans!

Dude...

14:47.303 --> 14:49.544
We were supposed to help her,
but she played us.

14:49.847 --> 14:53.090
Yep. She knew exactly what every
straight dude would be distracted by.

BOTH: Sweet Lady Theater.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.398
Ahem. Pen.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.900
We gotta talk.
This play is about Pete.

15:05.196 --> 15:06.903
What are you talking about?
Pete who?

15:07.198 --> 15:08.313
Oh, Pete Sampras?

which Pete you are referring.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.321
And besides, this is neither
the time nor the place.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.830
So when is
the right time, Pen?

15:18.126 --> 15:19.912
Whenever someone brings it up,
you try to avoid the subject.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.997
We're not gonna rehearse
until we talk about this.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.501

then you're fired.

15:26.801 --> 15:29.543

(LAUGHS) Fine.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.962
Good luck finding someone to
learn my lines by opening night.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.346
And good luck
finding someone

15:33.641 --> 15:34.847
who can open and close
the curtains.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.267
I'll get Derrick
to play Clete,

15:38.563 --> 15:39.519
and I'll just prop open the
curtains with a sandbag.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.099
Wait.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.811
Good luck finding a sandbag
with a goatee and a heart of honey!

15:48.114 --> 15:49.149
Yeah!

15:49.449 --> 15:50.860
I'm willing to negotiate.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.404
This is going to be rough.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.243
Yeah.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.078
| can't believe that you and Dave
couldn't get through to Penny.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.209
Really?
You can't believe it?

16:03.504 --> 16:06.212
We're idiots, Jane. That's
how we've always done it.

16:06.507 --> 16:09.340
All we can do now is be here for
Penny, as brutal as it's gonna be.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.091
And it's gonna be
pretty brutal,

16:11.387 --> 16:14.095
because Derrick as Clete
is the biggest miscasting

16:14.390 --> 16:16.222
since portobello mushrooms
started filling in for burgers.

16:16.517 --> 16:19.600

here to support our friend.

Who's opening this curtain?

16:22.148 --> 16:22.979
It should be a fluid
wave of velvet.

A bad person would've
married him anyway
