WOMAN:
Welcome to Wayne Enterprises.

00:03.537 --> 00:05.170
I have some questions
regarding Wayne Enterprises'

00:05.172 --> 00:06.605
business affairs.

00:09.209 --> 00:10.342
Where's Jim?

00:13.680 --> 00:15.848
Don Falcone thinks you don't
know how to run a club.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.649
(whistles)
Hi.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.084
He'll help you out.

00:19.086 --> 00:20.219
Those people out there

00:20.221 --> 00:22.955
<i>are using us as spare parts.</i>

00:22.957 --> 00:25.190
<i>Unless we do something
about it.</i>

00:25.192 --> 00:26.658
Alfred, can you teach me
how to fight?

00:26.660 --> 00:27.860
Yes, I can.

00:27.862 --> 00:29.695
BULLOCK:
<i>Pretty handy for a valet.</i>

00:29.697 --> 00:31.196
ALFRED:
<i>Butler, mate.</i>

00:31.198 --> 00:32.264
I'm a butler.

I made it. Yeah.
You made it?

01:05.266 --> 01:07.199
So what is it?
It's a hood.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.201
Thought it would, uh,
you know, spice things up.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.669
When did we start
wearing hoods?

01:10.671 --> 01:13.038
We didn't.
W-Was I supposed to get one?

01:13.040 --> 01:15.107
No!

01:20.613 --> 01:22.347

Ladies...
And gentlemen,

we are not here for your money!

01:26.787 --> 01:29.054
We're here for the bank's money!

01:29.056 --> 01:30.556
So just stay cool

01:30.558 --> 01:31.857
and no one will get hurt!

01:32.792 --> 01:34.693
Don't be brave!

01:34.695 --> 01:36.562
Don't be frightened!

01:36.564 --> 01:37.996
Just do
what you're told!

01:37.998 --> 01:39.731
This will all be over
quicker than that time

01:39.733 --> 01:41.834
I hooked up with a cheerleader

(man chuckles)

01:43.104 --> 01:44.536
What are you doing up there?!

01:44.538 --> 01:46.238
Getting 'em fired up.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.306
90 seconds.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.842
Nice and easy,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:49.844 --> 01:52.744
You know, banks like this one...
who are insured

01:52.746 --> 01:56.815
to death, by the way...
steal from us every single day!

01:56.817 --> 01:59.985
'Bout time a few of us returned
the favor, don't you think?

01:59.987 --> 02:02.254
60 seconds.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.736

02:21.107 --> 02:23.375
Th-Thirty seconds.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.377
Let's get out of here!

02:27.947 --> 02:30.782
You've been great, ladies
and germs, but we got to go!

02:30.784 --> 02:32.851
(chuckles)

02:34.754 --> 02:36.655
Did you see that?

02:36.657 --> 02:39.124
That guy missed me
with, like, six shots.
He was, old, nervous.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.126
(sirens wailing)
No, no, no, it's the hood.
I'm telling you.

02:41.128 --> 02:43.595
Damn it.
We're cooked.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.697
(sirens wailing)

02:47.500 --> 02:50.669
Attention, citizens of Gotham!

02:50.671 --> 02:51.937
What the hell are you doing?!

02:51.939 --> 02:53.772
There you go, everybody!

02:53.774 --> 02:55.307
(cheering, shouting)

02:55.309 --> 02:56.608
Take back

02:56.610 --> 02:58.043
what's yours!

02:58.045 --> 03:00.879
(cheering, shouting)

03:03.183 --> 03:05.050
Follow me! Come on.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.619

03:18.398 --> 03:20.465
(indistinct chatter,
cameras clicking)

03:28.975 --> 03:31.210
BULLOCK:
Well,

03:31.212 --> 03:33.579
we'll never know
how much cash was lost,

03:33.581 --> 03:36.515
but I just saw a bum
eating oysters at Madeline's.

03:36.517 --> 03:39.785
Another freak in a mask.
Awesome.

03:39.787 --> 03:43.622
Is that guard blind or wasted?

03:43.624 --> 03:45.791
Clyde refused
to wear his glasses.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.593
Said they made him look old.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.229
Missing a man standing 20 feet
in front of you with six shots

03:50.231 --> 03:51.597
makes you look old.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.265
Who tripped
the alarm?
I did.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.801
Why aren't you out there,
Detective?

03:55.803 --> 03:59.238
This brazen audacity
cannot be tolerated.

03:59.240 --> 04:02.074
They didn't go for the vault...
just the cash

04:02.076 --> 04:04.076
in the registers.
And the crew was in and out

04:04.078 --> 04:05.978
in under two minutes.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.779
The red-hooded man seemed nice.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.147
Nice?

04:09.149 --> 04:11.984
He wasn't stealing our money...
just the bank's.

04:11.986 --> 04:13.518
Then he gave
a lot of it

04:13.520 --> 04:15.554
back to people in the street.
Like...

04:16.456 --> 04:18.322
...Robin Hood.

04:18.325 --> 04:20.993
Oh, great.
This bank hires Communists.

04:20.995 --> 04:23.528
Robin Hood stole from the rich
and gave to the poor.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.864
These armed thieves
only threw cash away

04:25.866 --> 04:27.366
to guarantee
their escape.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.201
It's very different, ma'am.

04:29.203 --> 04:30.736
The thief

04:30.738 --> 04:34.006
in the back here, was he always
checking his watch?
Yes.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.274
He was counting down.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.109
They knew what our
response time was.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.343
They'd done their homework.

04:38.345 --> 04:40.345
Has the alarm been triggered
for any other reason recently?

04:40.347 --> 04:42.381
No.
Well,

04:42.383 --> 04:44.750
there was that time
with the smoke bomb.

04:44.752 --> 04:45.817
Smoke bomb?

04:45.819 --> 04:48.287
A week or so ago,
a small flare or firework,

04:48.289 --> 04:49.821
or something, was set off
by the Mortgages desk.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.557
It tripped the alarm.
We thought

04:52.559 --> 04:54.626
it was just a kid's prank.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.461
We're gonna need you
to find the surveillance footage

04:56.463 --> 04:57.796
from that incident.

04:58.931 --> 05:01.867
(thunder crashing)
(knocking on door)

05:02.835 --> 05:04.903
(knocking continues)

05:16.482 --> 05:18.750
Yes, sir. How can I help you?

05:22.555 --> 05:23.955
Reggie?

05:23.957 --> 05:26.491
Sorry for calling
so late.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.593
Forgive me.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.996
Oh, my God, mate.
How long's it been?

05:30.998 --> 05:34.066
20 years.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.070
I got picked up by the GCPD
last night

05:38.072 --> 05:41.340
for trying to sleep
under the Westbury Bridge.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.608
Here, mate.
Cheers, mate.

05:43.610 --> 05:47.512
One of the officers
was a Marine, back in the day,

05:47.514 --> 05:49.681
so we got to talking.
I told him

05:49.683 --> 05:52.684
I was with Her Majesty's Special
Air Service back in the day.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.152
So he took pity on me.

05:54.154 --> 05:58.056
He says, "Why don't you look up
some of your old regiment,

05:58.058 --> 06:01.059
you know, see if one of the guys
can... help you out."

06:01.061 --> 06:03.195
Well, you know...

06:04.731 --> 06:06.932
I'm pleased
you looked me up, Reg.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.934
If anyone
would've told me

06:08.936 --> 06:12.237
this is where I'd find you,
I wouldn't have believed them.

06:12.239 --> 06:15.574
I like it here.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.709
It's good for me.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.978
I can see that.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.514
I've missed you,
mate.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.816
Missed your ugly mug.

06:26.252 --> 06:28.120
Cheers.

06:29.088 --> 06:32.124
What happened, Reggie?

06:33.092 --> 06:35.060
Vanessa died.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.796
11 years ago now.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.799
I just couldn't find the energy

06:40.801 --> 06:44.469
to get back out there
after that, you know?

06:44.471 --> 06:47.439
A year later, I lost the house.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.608
Moved back
to Gotham.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.877
I've had a few jobs.

06:51.879 --> 06:54.780
Nothing I'm proud of.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.918
It was the drink, Alfie.

07:01.821 --> 07:04.189
It was the drink.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.757
BRUCE:
Alfred?

07:07.527 --> 07:09.428
Um, Master Bruce.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.196
This is, uh,

07:11.198 --> 07:12.998
Reginald Payne.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
We served together, sir.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.904
Very pleased
to meet you, sir.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.572
You were caught in the storm?

07:20.574 --> 07:22.841
Reggie's had a run of
bad luck, Master Bruce.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.177
I-I don't wish to be a nuisance.
I just...

07:25.179 --> 07:28.447
I hadn't seen Alfie
in a very long time.

07:28.449 --> 07:32.050
N-No, I'm glad you found us,
Mr. Payne.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.619
Please, feel free to stay
with us a few days.

07:35.922 --> 07:37.756
That's very kind of you, but...

07:37.758 --> 07:38.890
I insist.

07:40.226 --> 07:41.326
Please.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.599
MOONEY:
Where are you taking me?

07:47.601 --> 07:49.801
MAN:
This way, Miss Mooney.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.870
(moaning, shouting in distance)

08:19.031 --> 08:21.032
Who chose these people?

08:21.034 --> 08:23.101
Where'd you get them from?

08:34.647 --> 08:35.981
(door shuts)

08:35.982 --> 08:38.616
(lock clicks)

08:39.684 --> 08:42.254
Sit, please.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.627
Sit.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.971
There you are, Mr. Red Hood.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.973
Armed robbery perps
dating back ten years.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.309
I took out the dead ones
and the ones in prison.

09:04.311 --> 09:05.644
A who's who
of scumbags.

09:05.646 --> 09:08.213
They were casing the place
a week before they took it down.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.782
Set off the alarm
then timed the response.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.351
He looks pretty young.
He might not be in here.

09:18.457 --> 09:20.592
You see that?

09:20.594 --> 09:22.794
No, 'cause you took my glasses.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.629
Right there,
underneath his coat.

09:24.631 --> 09:27.098
He's wearing a work shirt.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.167
"Kleg's Auto."

09:31.437 --> 09:33.806
Idiot.
(chuckles)

09:33.807 --> 09:35.874
(music blaring)

09:39.279 --> 09:40.879
(chuckles)

09:40.881 --> 09:43.048
"The Red Hood Gang"!
(chuckles)

09:43.050 --> 09:44.883
It's got a ring to it.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.551
No, it doesn't.
See those people?

09:46.553 --> 09:47.853
They loved me.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.321
They loved the money
you threw at 'em.

09:49.323 --> 09:50.989
Thanks for that,
by the way.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.491
Shall we take it out
of your share?

09:52.493 --> 09:53.892
You guys don't get it.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.561
We're not just five mooks
with shotguns anymore.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.230
We're the Red Hood Gang.

09:58.232 --> 10:00.699
Taking from the rich
and giving back to the poor.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.567
Mark my words,

10:02.569 --> 10:05.103
the people in this town,
they're gonna get me.

10:06.005 --> 10:08.173
Us.
Will you shut up?

10:08.175 --> 10:10.075
All that prancing around
could have gotten us killed.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.344
You're wrong. That guard,
he was 20 feet away from me.

10:12.346 --> 10:13.712
Not one shot got close.

10:13.714 --> 10:14.613
Luck!

10:14.615 --> 10:17.115
He looked
r-real nervous.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.016
It's the hood!

10:18.018 --> 10:19.718
It's good luck.
I'm telling you.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.720
I feel like a totally
different person with it on.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.088
Eh, sit down, will ya?

10:23.090 --> 10:24.589
We need to go over
tomorrow's score.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.758
Nah, this sets us apart.

10:26.760 --> 10:30.228
It's a piece of cloth...
two holes cut out of it.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.831
It's a symbol!

10:32.833 --> 10:35.100
Whoever wears
the hood

10:35.102 --> 10:36.501
should lead!
(gunshot)

10:37.103 --> 10:38.103
(grunts)

10:41.374 --> 10:44.042
(grunting)

10:49.916 --> 10:52.584
He's right.

10:52.586 --> 10:55.921
Any objections?

11:06.731 --> 11:07.864
So...

11:07.866 --> 11:12.268
you're the one causing
all of the fuss.

11:12.270 --> 11:14.571
The one with
the knife now.

11:14.573 --> 11:16.639
This is your facility?

11:16.641 --> 11:17.841
I manage it, yes.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.009
But do you own it?

11:20.011 --> 11:21.745
The doctor owns it.

11:22.713 --> 11:25.515
Where are you going?

11:25.517 --> 11:28.251
Back to the basement.
We're done here.

11:28.253 --> 11:29.253
Miss Mooney...

11:35.359 --> 11:36.693
Take a seat.

11:36.695 --> 11:39.662
I will talk to the doctor
and the doctor only.

11:39.664 --> 11:42.365
He's away on a consultation
in Gotham.

11:42.367 --> 11:44.167
Then call me when he returns.

11:44.169 --> 11:46.503
He expressly asked <i> me</i>

11:46.505 --> 11:48.705
to attend to your demands.

11:50.274 --> 11:52.275
His name.

11:52.277 --> 11:53.877
I'm sorry?

11:53.879 --> 11:56.813
The doctor. His name.

11:58.949 --> 12:01.017
Dulmacher.

12:03.754 --> 12:07.157
You tell Dr. Dulmacher

12:07.159 --> 12:09.759
that the basement is mine.

12:09.761 --> 12:11.961
No one will leave

12:11.963 --> 12:14.831
unless I say so.
It will remain that way

12:14.833 --> 12:17.100
until he sits with me

12:17.102 --> 12:19.269
and negotiates terms.

12:26.310 --> 12:29.712
Perhaps...

12:29.714 --> 12:32.348
you and I got off
on the wrong foot, Miss Mooney.

12:32.350 --> 12:34.017
When was the last time

12:34.019 --> 12:37.320
you had a shower?
A new set of clothes? Hmm?

12:37.322 --> 12:39.689
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

12:39.691 --> 12:40.790
(door opens)

12:40.792 --> 12:43.660
Take Miss Mooney to
my private bathroom,

12:43.662 --> 12:45.862
and then pick up
some fresh clothes for her

12:45.864 --> 12:47.163
from storage.

12:47.165 --> 12:48.832
Freshen up.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.500
Come back to me.

12:50.502 --> 12:53.102
And then perhaps we'll talk
some more.

12:56.373 --> 12:58.875
COMEDIAN:
<i>So the mortician says</i>

12:58.877 --> 13:01.344
to the waitress... No, the
waitress says to the mortician,

13:01.346 --> 13:04.347
(clears throat)
"He was always stiff."

13:04.349 --> 13:05.548
MAN 2:
That's it.

13:05.550 --> 13:07.817
Let's go.
Wait. No.

13:07.819 --> 13:11.754
Have a good night.
See you next week, sir. Okay.
(patrons groaning, moaning)

13:11.756 --> 13:15.625
It's fine. We got, uh...
What do we have? We got, um...
MAN 3: Check, please.

13:15.627 --> 13:17.961
(whispering)
COMEDIAN: ...cards.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.429
Oh, okay. Um...

13:19.431 --> 13:20.964
What's wrong?

13:20.966 --> 13:23.233
Ah, Mr. Penguin.
I mean the Penguin. I mean...

13:23.235 --> 13:25.268
I...
What is it?

13:25.270 --> 13:27.837
We're out of booze.

13:27.839 --> 13:31.307
What? Hello? Behind you,
there's a wall of booze.

13:31.309 --> 13:33.776
Just colored water, sir.
Always has been.

13:33.778 --> 13:37.914
We keep the real stuff
down here, but we're out.

13:37.916 --> 13:40.783
So, duh, order more.
We did.

13:40.785 --> 13:41.951
It's just that...

13:41.953 --> 13:44.621
GILZEAN:
It's Maroni's booze.

13:44.623 --> 13:47.690
And he's a little grumpy
with you these days.

13:49.660 --> 13:52.829
He was hardly a fan
of Fish, either.

13:52.831 --> 13:55.832
Why did he sell her booze?

13:55.834 --> 13:57.166
Business is business.

13:57.168 --> 13:59.669
But he hates you with a passion.

13:59.671 --> 14:03.072
But he can't kill you, so...
That's...

14:03.074 --> 14:05.608
This is ridiculous. There's
a thousand places to buy booze.

14:05.610 --> 14:07.610
That's where
it gets complicated.

14:07.612 --> 14:11.114
See, Maroni, he supplies
this whole side of town.

14:11.116 --> 14:14.017
No one would dare cross him
to help you.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.051
(patrons booing,
glass shattering)

14:15.053 --> 14:16.053
Help...

14:16.054 --> 14:17.220
WOMAN:
Get outta here!

14:17.222 --> 14:19.222
Thank you.
Bye. Sorry.

14:19.224 --> 14:20.924
MALE PATRON:
You're not funny.
(patrons murmur, catcall)

14:20.926 --> 14:24.394
(snickering): You must take
great pleasure watching me fail.

14:24.396 --> 14:26.129
On the contrary.

14:26.131 --> 14:28.064
I was with Fish

14:28.066 --> 14:31.568
when we took this place off
a Chinese bookie nine years ago.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.703
It was used for cock fighting.

14:33.705 --> 14:35.905
Took forever
to get the smell out.

14:37.641 --> 14:40.243
My blood, sweat, and tears
are in this dive.

14:41.812 --> 14:44.681
Well, if you'll excuse me,

14:44.683 --> 14:47.850
it seems as though I need
to procure some alcohol

14:47.852 --> 14:50.954
for my dwindling clientele.

14:52.823 --> 14:54.424
Be careful.

14:54.426 --> 14:57.860
You've seen what happens
when you cross Maroni.

15:07.872 --> 15:09.939
GCPD!

15:17.148 --> 15:19.949
Looks like they were here
last night.

15:19.951 --> 15:21.151
Hey.

15:21.153 --> 15:22.819
Your hot doctor friend,
Thompkins...

15:22.821 --> 15:24.754
Leslie.
Whatever.

15:24.756 --> 15:28.057
Give me the double D...
"dirty details."

15:28.059 --> 15:30.193
Don't leave anything out.

15:30.195 --> 15:31.728
(chuckles)

15:31.730 --> 15:32.796
Gotta hand it
to you, partner.

15:32.798 --> 15:34.097
You don't sit
around moping.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.800
You got right back up
on the hobby horse.

15:36.802 --> 15:38.501
Let's just hope you can
keep your head straight

15:38.503 --> 15:40.503
whilst up there.

15:40.505 --> 15:41.671
You had the purse.

15:41.673 --> 15:43.139
Now you got yourself a nurse.

15:43.141 --> 15:45.442
(chuckles)

15:46.410 --> 15:49.446
Well, looks like I found
our friend Floyd.

15:55.619 --> 15:58.354
What? If I don't drink it,
Forensics will.

16:00.291 --> 16:03.126
GORDON: All right. This was
the guy with the hood.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.794
He's wearing
the same coat.

16:04.796 --> 16:07.797
I wonder what he did to
piss off the rest of his crew.

16:07.799 --> 16:09.999
Maybe they knew
we'd catch up to him.

16:10.001 --> 16:12.135
Well, he was the leader,
so it looks like we've seen

16:12.137 --> 16:15.205
the last of the
Red Hood crew now.

16:18.442 --> 16:19.309
(people screaming)

16:19.311 --> 16:22.145
Good morning, everyone!

16:23.814 --> 16:25.582
(grunting)

16:26.617 --> 16:28.918
Get off me! I got it.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.420
Okay.
We're not here

16:30.422 --> 16:32.088
for your money.

16:32.090 --> 16:34.190
We're here for the insurance!

16:35.126 --> 16:36.960
I mean the bank's insured money!

16:36.962 --> 16:38.428
60 seconds.

16:39.263 --> 16:40.397
MAN: Hey! You gonna
share a little bit

16:40.399 --> 16:41.631
of that cash with us, Hood?

16:41.633 --> 16:42.633
(others agreeing)

16:42.634 --> 16:45.168
Th-Thirty seconds.

16:46.404 --> 16:48.071
(grunts)
MAN:
Come on. A lot of us

16:48.073 --> 16:49.172
are hurting here.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.307
(others agreeing)

16:50.309 --> 16:51.775
Ten seconds. L-L...

16:51.777 --> 16:53.176
L-Let's go!

16:53.178 --> 16:54.344
Aw, fine.

16:55.813 --> 16:58.081
(laughs)

16:58.083 --> 17:00.383
(cheering, shouting)

17:02.153 --> 17:03.820
So long, Gotham!

17:03.822 --> 17:05.954
Sayonara!

17:10.794 --> 17:13.429
(indistinct chatter)

17:13.431 --> 17:15.431
And then there were four.

17:15.433 --> 17:17.900
People are gonna hang out
in banks waiting for handouts

17:17.902 --> 17:19.401
from these idiots.

17:19.403 --> 17:21.569
We're never gonna catch a crew
no one wants us to catch.

17:21.571 --> 17:22.671
Call me old-fashioned,
but when crooks

17:22.673 --> 17:24.807
become more popular
than cops,

17:24.809 --> 17:27.142
that's anarchy.
Think about it.

17:27.144 --> 17:29.445
As long as somebody's willing
to put that red hood on,

17:29.447 --> 17:31.146
this gang can go on forever.

17:31.148 --> 17:32.414
ALVAREZ:
Hey, guys.

17:32.416 --> 17:34.216
Got somebody here
you might want to meet.

17:34.218 --> 17:35.951
This is Mister...
Chaing.

17:35.953 --> 17:38.287
Chaing, right.
He's an eyewitness.

17:38.289 --> 17:39.855
From the bank?

17:39.857 --> 17:41.523
I work at a restaurant
a block away.

17:41.525 --> 17:43.859
The Red Hood Gang parked
their van there this morning.

17:43.861 --> 17:45.494
I was throwing out
the trash

17:45.496 --> 17:46.829
when they ran back to it.

17:46.831 --> 17:48.030
You see their faces?

17:48.032 --> 17:50.165
Just one... the fat
one with the hood.

17:50.167 --> 17:51.734
He took it off to drive.

17:52.836 --> 17:55.037
I'll get the sketch artist.
Well, wait a minute.

17:55.039 --> 17:57.773
Got the armed robbery
files already opened.

17:57.775 --> 18:00.376
Maybe he can look through them,
see if he recognizes someone.

18:00.378 --> 18:02.911
Maybe that someone is
a known associate of Gus Floyd.

18:02.913 --> 18:05.648
Only problem is records are
kind of old... he might
look different now.

18:05.650 --> 18:08.050
We could pull a few based
off Chaing's description.

18:08.052 --> 18:10.252
Get ourselves a good
old-fashioned lineup.

18:10.254 --> 18:13.455
Wait. Wait a second.
What's in it for me?

18:14.591 --> 18:16.125
I got all these parking tickets

18:16.127 --> 18:18.460
because my ex-wife
is a crazy bitch.

18:18.462 --> 18:21.063
We'll see what we can do.

18:28.571 --> 18:30.639
(panting)

18:32.242 --> 18:34.677
Training
for a fight?

18:37.781 --> 18:39.648
Just training.

18:39.650 --> 18:41.283
Who's helping you?

18:41.285 --> 18:43.552
Alfred.

18:43.554 --> 18:44.887
Good choice.

18:44.889 --> 18:47.289
Show me your stance.

18:55.198 --> 18:56.565
Good.

18:56.567 --> 18:58.033
Hit me.

18:58.035 --> 18:59.702
(grunts)

19:00.470 --> 19:02.204
Again.

19:03.707 --> 19:06.041
(grunts)
And don't hold back.

19:06.043 --> 19:07.743
You have a go at me, son.

19:07.745 --> 19:09.411
(grunting)

19:09.413 --> 19:10.413
(shouts)

19:11.348 --> 19:12.881
Come on.

19:12.883 --> 19:14.883
It should take more than that
to piss you off, son.

19:14.885 --> 19:16.552
Come on.

19:16.554 --> 19:17.820
Again.

19:17.822 --> 19:19.388
Come on.

19:19.390 --> 19:20.322
(grunts)

19:20.324 --> 19:21.256
(shouts)

19:21.258 --> 19:23.492
(Reggie laughing)

19:23.494 --> 19:24.993
(grunting)

19:24.995 --> 19:27.496
Now, now.
Never lose your cool.

19:27.498 --> 19:29.031
It'll get you killed.

19:29.033 --> 19:31.600
Now, you want to hit me, right?
You want to hit me, right?

19:31.602 --> 19:33.736
Okay. Take a swing.

19:33.738 --> 19:35.971
Take a swing.
Go on. Do it.

19:37.407 --> 19:38.340
(grunts)

19:38.342 --> 19:40.008
Somebody gives you
a free shot,

19:40.010 --> 19:41.443
you got to make it count.

19:41.445 --> 19:42.945
You hit me
as hard as you can.

19:42.947 --> 19:44.613
(grunts)
Oh. Better.

19:44.615 --> 19:45.748
Put your shoulder behind it.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.349
Put your full
body weight behind it.

19:47.351 --> 19:48.517
Go on. Do it.

19:48.519 --> 19:49.084
(shouts)
(grunts)

19:49.086 --> 19:51.186
Harder. Again.

19:51.188 --> 19:53.389
(shouts)
(grunts)

19:56.092 --> 19:56.859
Again.

19:56.861 --> 19:58.293
Come on.
Do it again.

19:58.295 --> 20:00.429
Put me on my back, son.
Come on, you can do it.

20:00.431 --> 20:01.730
Come on. Again.

20:01.732 --> 20:02.965
You're so much bigger than me!

20:02.967 --> 20:04.299
Then use that to your advantage!

20:04.301 --> 20:05.234
You hit me low.

20:05.236 --> 20:07.469
Hit me in the knee, the ankle.

20:07.471 --> 20:08.904
Forget
about the gloves!

20:08.906 --> 20:10.272
Use whatever's around you.

20:10.274 --> 20:12.741
Here. Here.

20:14.310 --> 20:15.778
Go on.
ALFRED:
Right!

20:15.780 --> 20:18.313
That's enough
of that.

20:20.417 --> 20:22.951
Perhaps a shower's
in order, Master Bruce.

20:25.121 --> 20:28.123
M-Mr. Payne was just showing me
some alternative methods.

20:28.125 --> 20:29.958
Yeah, I can see
that, can't I?

20:29.960 --> 20:33.495
Not methods that fit into our
curriculum, though, are they?

20:33.497 --> 20:35.497
No, they're not;
but they're effective.

20:35.499 --> 20:37.599
Discipline, skill,

20:37.601 --> 20:40.035
and hard work are effective.

20:44.174 --> 20:46.508
How 'bout I start that shower
for you, sir?

20:48.411 --> 20:50.546
No.

20:57.554 --> 20:59.822
(door opens upstairs,
then shuts)

20:59.824 --> 21:02.191
You ever raised
a child before, Reg?

21:02.193 --> 21:04.193
No.

21:04.195 --> 21:06.428
Me neither.

21:06.430 --> 21:10.365
Hardest job
I've ever had to do in my life.

21:10.367 --> 21:13.202
Nothing prepares you for it.

21:13.204 --> 21:15.204
Listen, I'm sorry
if I overstepped the mark.

21:15.206 --> 21:16.905
I was just...

21:16.907 --> 21:18.874
It was obvious
how much you've helped him s...

21:18.876 --> 21:20.642
No, he helped me.

21:22.278 --> 21:26.315
I'm a better person
for knowing him, Reg.

21:29.219 --> 21:32.287
Let's keep our past
where it belongs.

21:33.756 --> 21:36.124
In the past.

21:53.009 --> 21:56.945
(snickering):
That's it? Just two workers?

21:58.248 --> 21:59.815
This'll be easy.

21:59.817 --> 22:01.116
Make it quick, guys.

22:01.118 --> 22:03.552
(sirens wailing)

22:09.259 --> 22:11.159
Well, this is inconvenient.

22:11.161 --> 22:12.794
WORKMAN:
Whoa, Officer.

22:12.796 --> 22:13.796
Nothing going on here.

22:13.797 --> 22:15.497
That so?

22:15.499 --> 22:17.332
Eh, your liquor license
is out of date.

22:17.334 --> 22:19.234
We're gonna be
confiscating the shipment.

22:19.236 --> 22:20.969
Hey, does Don Maroni
know you guys are here?

22:20.971 --> 22:24.540
Walk away...
before I run you downtown.

22:27.110 --> 22:29.845
This town is truly
going to the dogs.

22:29.847 --> 22:31.047
Evening, fellas.
(Oswald gasps)

22:31.048 --> 22:32.381
(gun cocks)

22:32.383 --> 22:33.383
(mutters indistinctly)

22:33.384 --> 22:35.717
(panting)

22:35.719 --> 22:37.352
Why the smile, Butch?

22:37.354 --> 22:38.854
First Maroni blocks
our liquor,

22:38.856 --> 22:40.389
and now the cops?

22:40.391 --> 22:41.957
Oh, who, them?

22:41.959 --> 22:43.158
They're with me.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.994
I always keep a few
uniforms in the closet.

22:45.996 --> 22:49.197
A lot cleaner than going in
guns blazing, don't you think?

22:50.867 --> 22:52.668
You're welcome, Oswald.

22:53.570 --> 22:54.570
(chuckles)

22:54.572 --> 22:56.638
(siren wailing in distance)

22:57.373 --> 22:58.540
Nice work there.

22:58.542 --> 22:59.541
How you doing,
Mr. Gilzean?

22:59.543 --> 23:00.542
GILZEAN:
This over here, this...

23:00.544 --> 23:02.344
OFFICER:
Nothing to worry about.

23:11.420 --> 23:13.487
(music playing over headphones)

23:27.869 --> 23:29.937
You okay?

23:32.240 --> 23:34.742
Of course.

23:34.744 --> 23:37.745
Thank you for
letting us stay here.

23:37.747 --> 23:39.080
Sorry it got
a little messy.

23:39.082 --> 23:40.348
I was just about to go.

23:40.350 --> 23:43.618
I like having
you guys here.

23:46.021 --> 23:48.189
(coughs)

23:48.191 --> 23:49.256
Selina...

23:50.359 --> 23:52.159
Come here.

23:55.063 --> 23:58.366
You know, you're turning into
quite the beautiful woman.

23:58.368 --> 24:01.268
No, I'm not.

24:01.270 --> 24:04.171
Remove the dirt...

24:04.173 --> 24:05.773
that old hood...

24:05.775 --> 24:07.775
these ratty clothes...

24:09.311 --> 24:11.379
I bet we find
a princess undernea...

24:15.584 --> 24:17.652
I have an idea.

24:21.690 --> 24:23.824
Holy moly.

24:23.826 --> 24:26.127
Take anything that
fits you guys.

24:26.129 --> 24:28.129
This is all stuff you've worn?

24:28.131 --> 24:30.898
Most of it.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.034
You sure must go out a lot.

24:33.036 --> 24:34.602
I used to.

24:43.311 --> 24:45.379
Come with me.

24:59.628 --> 25:01.696
You're a true beauty.

25:03.432 --> 25:06.333
Something you can use
to your advantage.

25:06.335 --> 25:10.471
Your appearance
can be a weapon,

25:10.473 --> 25:14.542
as powerful
as any knife or gun.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.548
Yeah?

25:24.920 --> 25:27.521
What good's it done you?

25:31.793 --> 25:33.227
(door opens)

25:40.602 --> 25:42.870
BULLOCK (over speaker):
All right, backs to the wall.

25:42.872 --> 25:44.472
Hold your numbers up.

25:44.474 --> 25:46.540
No talking.

25:49.311 --> 25:51.245
I thought they were going
to be similar types.

25:51.247 --> 25:52.247
They are.

25:52.248 --> 25:54.181
Uh-huh.

25:54.183 --> 25:55.950
Look closely, Mr. Chaing.

25:55.952 --> 25:57.284
I know how this works.

25:58.487 --> 26:02.523
There, number four...
the short, fat one.

26:02.525 --> 26:04.091
You're sure?
That's your Red Hood.

26:04.093 --> 26:07.461
Threw all that money away,
and I didn't get a cent.

26:07.463 --> 26:10.131
Clyde Destro,
47 years old, conviction

26:10.133 --> 26:12.032
for assault and armed robbery
of a convenience store

26:12.034 --> 26:13.100
three years ago.

26:13.102 --> 26:14.935
Let's book him.
Wait a minute.

26:14.937 --> 26:17.204
All we have is one witness
outside of the crime scene,

26:17.206 --> 26:18.206
that's it.

26:18.207 --> 26:19.340
Now, Floyd was killed,

26:19.342 --> 26:20.942
so we know they're
turning on each other.

26:20.943 --> 26:22.376
Let Destro go?

26:22.378 --> 26:23.477
And tail him.

26:23.479 --> 26:24.979
He takes us to the
other gang members.

26:24.981 --> 26:26.547
We use them
against each other.

26:26.549 --> 26:28.649
We catch the Red Hood Gang
red-handed.

26:28.651 --> 26:29.784
That's right.

26:29.786 --> 26:31.252
Can I get a ride home?

26:32.154 --> 26:33.454
My girlfriend will freak out

26:33.456 --> 26:35.222
if I turn up in a patrol car.

26:36.892 --> 26:39.293
(door opens)

26:40.228 --> 26:42.930
Well...

26:42.932 --> 26:45.599
don't you look lovely?

26:45.601 --> 26:46.700
(door closes)

26:46.702 --> 26:49.370
There's still business
to discuss.

26:49.372 --> 26:50.805
Of course.

26:50.807 --> 26:52.306
The basement.

26:52.308 --> 26:54.308
How do I resume operations?

26:54.310 --> 26:56.977
We do have a business to run.

26:56.979 --> 27:00.414
Yes, you're stealing body parts.

27:00.416 --> 27:01.649
For who?

27:01.651 --> 27:02.651
Oh!

27:02.652 --> 27:04.752
We have clients...

27:04.754 --> 27:08.055
all over the world in
need of such things.

27:08.057 --> 27:11.992
Also, there's the doctor's

27:11.994 --> 27:14.061
personal experiments.

27:18.166 --> 27:20.267
You have such
a presence,

27:20.269 --> 27:23.304
Miss Mooney.

27:25.073 --> 27:27.141
Such a gaze.

27:28.076 --> 27:30.878
Your eyes...

27:30.880 --> 27:33.314
will fetch quite a penny.

27:33.316 --> 27:37.885
You will take nothing from me.

27:37.887 --> 27:38.986
Really?

27:38.988 --> 27:40.387
Because the way I see it,

27:40.389 --> 27:42.389
you have two choices: One...

27:42.391 --> 27:45.326
we kill you and your little
friends in the basement.

27:45.328 --> 27:48.996
That's an inconvenience
but an acceptable one.

27:48.998 --> 27:51.065
Or, two...

27:52.567 --> 27:55.135
...we take your eyes now

27:55.137 --> 27:59.106
and see how long a blind girl
can survive in the basement.

28:03.011 --> 28:05.012
You forgot option three.

28:05.014 --> 28:05.913
(grunts)

28:05.915 --> 28:07.381
Stop her!

28:07.383 --> 28:08.949
(both scream)

28:17.626 --> 28:18.559
No!

28:18.561 --> 28:19.960
(spoon clinks)

28:20.929 --> 28:21.996
(thud)

28:26.633 --> 28:28.701
(thunder rumbles; Alfred and
Reggie converse quietly)

28:28.703 --> 28:31.137
I picked something out
from the cellar.

28:31.139 --> 28:33.039
I hope that's okay.

28:33.041 --> 28:34.774
Well, that's, uh,
extremely kind of you,

28:34.776 --> 28:36.909
Master Bruce,
but I don't think that we...

28:38.412 --> 28:41.113
...that I'll be, uh,
drinking this evening.

28:41.115 --> 28:42.548
I'm sure it's perfectly fine
to have

28:42.550 --> 28:44.517
a glass of wine occasionally,
Alfred.

28:44.519 --> 28:46.519
I-I picked an old one.

28:46.521 --> 28:48.821
Seems a shame to let them
gather dust down there.

28:50.090 --> 28:54.193
Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.

28:57.264 --> 29:00.800
It's a rather nice Burgundy,
actually, it's 1966.

29:02.002 --> 29:03.669
Yeah.

29:03.671 --> 29:05.538
It's one of your
father's favorites.

29:05.540 --> 29:07.907
(chuckles)

29:10.777 --> 29:12.345
Why not, eh?

29:12.347 --> 29:13.412
Take a pew.

29:15.616 --> 29:18.184
That's very kind of you.

29:18.186 --> 29:19.186
There you go.

29:19.187 --> 29:20.486
Cheers, mate.

29:24.491 --> 29:27.059
Now, the idea,
of course,

29:27.061 --> 29:30.730
is to let it breathe
for at least an hour.

29:34.301 --> 29:35.735
Or not.

29:35.737 --> 29:36.702
(slurps)

29:36.704 --> 29:37.837
(laughs)

29:37.839 --> 29:39.338
Ah.

29:39.340 --> 29:40.340
Delicious.

29:40.341 --> 29:42.141
(laughter)

29:42.143 --> 29:44.277
So he eventually
opened his backpack

29:44.279 --> 29:45.678
and he found the
bloody snake.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.747
We'd been waiting
for it all night.

29:47.749 --> 29:49.315
He didn't even flinch.

29:49.317 --> 29:51.250
What'd you do?
Oh, you know,

29:51.252 --> 29:53.919
I chopped its head off
and we ate the bloody thing.

29:53.921 --> 29:54.854
(laughter)

29:54.856 --> 29:56.222
He did.

29:56.224 --> 29:57.356
What did it taste like?

29:57.358 --> 29:58.691
ALFRED:
Uh, a bit like, um,

29:58.693 --> 29:59.925
fast food.

29:59.927 --> 30:01.327
(all laugh)

30:01.329 --> 30:02.628
ALFRED:
It was horrible.

30:02.630 --> 30:03.763
It was horrible.

30:03.765 --> 30:05.264
It was disgusting.

30:05.266 --> 30:06.966
BRUCE:
So, um...

30:06.968 --> 30:08.934
so, Mr. Payne,
you were in the Air Force?

30:08.936 --> 30:11.771
Special Air Service... SAS.

30:11.773 --> 30:13.339
Best soldiers
in the world,

30:13.341 --> 30:15.508
if I'm being honest.

30:15.510 --> 30:17.910
So that means covert missions?

30:17.912 --> 30:20.046
That's right.

30:20.048 --> 30:21.781
Before a conflict,
they dropped us

30:21.783 --> 30:23.749
behind enemy lines.

30:23.751 --> 30:24.850
We were quiet,

30:24.852 --> 30:27.887
precise, and deadly.

30:27.889 --> 30:29.588
We never lost a man

30:29.590 --> 30:31.657
and we always completed
our missions.

30:33.627 --> 30:35.061
Except that once, I guess.

30:35.063 --> 30:36.362
Yeah, well,

30:36.364 --> 30:39.031
that's enough
of the old war stories, eh, Reg?

30:39.033 --> 30:41.067
What one time?

30:42.035 --> 30:44.036
REGGIE:
There was a sandstorm.

30:44.038 --> 30:46.372
We got separated.

30:46.374 --> 30:48.774
Two of us were captured.

30:48.776 --> 30:50.910
You?

30:52.145 --> 30:55.648
He fought 12 of them off
before they cut him down.

30:55.650 --> 30:58.117
Didn't you, Alf?

30:59.820 --> 31:02.154
I'm here now, aren't I?

31:02.156 --> 31:03.522
That's all that matters.

31:03.524 --> 31:04.990
(sniffs)

31:04.992 --> 31:06.325
All right, gents,
while I have to say

31:06.327 --> 31:07.326
this has been
absolutely lovely,

31:07.328 --> 31:09.161
I'd like to,

31:09.163 --> 31:11.263
I'd like to tidy up
before I go to bed.

31:11.265 --> 31:13.466
(scoffing):
T-T-Tidy up?

31:13.468 --> 31:15.968
Mr. Yes Sir, No Sir.

31:15.970 --> 31:18.504
Mr. Queensberry rules
and discipline.

31:18.506 --> 31:19.772
Thank you, that's enough.

31:22.909 --> 31:24.143
Alfred's right...

31:24.145 --> 31:25.811
it's time for bed.

31:27.347 --> 31:29.081
Good night,
Master Bruce.

31:29.083 --> 31:30.750
BRUCE:
Good night. Good night.

31:30.752 --> 31:32.818
Sleep well, son.

31:34.554 --> 31:36.822
Why are you hiding from him
what you really are,

31:36.824 --> 31:38.524
who you really are?

31:40.494 --> 31:43.162
You're a war dog, Alfie.

31:44.131 --> 31:46.132
You're a cold-blooded,

31:46.134 --> 31:49.468
lethal war dog, is what you are.

31:53.640 --> 31:56.142
I found some fresh clothes
for you, Reg.

31:56.144 --> 31:58.244
I folded them
and I put 'em on your bed,

31:58.246 --> 32:00.613
and I've taken the liberty
of packing you

32:00.615 --> 32:03.916
a lunch for your travels
tomorrow.

32:03.918 --> 32:06.519
It's been really nice
to see you, Reggie.

32:07.687 --> 32:11.290
I see them, at night...
when I'm alone.

32:12.526 --> 32:14.527
The faces...

32:14.529 --> 32:17.363
the faces of those we killed.

32:17.365 --> 32:18.798
Do you?

32:18.800 --> 32:22.168
I don't have to look
for them, Reg.

32:24.137 --> 32:26.639
They find me.

32:57.504 --> 32:59.171
(startled shout)

32:59.173 --> 33:01.440
(gasps, chuckles)

33:01.442 --> 33:03.342
Holy crap.

33:03.344 --> 33:05.077
You scared the snot out of me.

33:05.079 --> 33:06.412
H-Had to see you.

33:06.414 --> 33:07.480
I c-couldn't wait.

33:07.482 --> 33:08.948
Where were you?

33:08.950 --> 33:10.015
Out.

33:10.017 --> 33:12.284
J-Just out?

33:12.286 --> 33:14.520
What's it to you?

33:14.522 --> 33:16.755
I need the hood.

33:16.757 --> 33:17.757
What?

33:17.758 --> 33:19.625
No.
M...

33:19.627 --> 33:21.627
My-my girlfriend, sh-she
wants... she wants to leave.

33:21.629 --> 33:24.663
She... she called me
a loser last night.

33:24.665 --> 33:27.066
Her ex is back in town.
He's a b-bouncer.

33:27.068 --> 33:28.667
I figured
she-she sees me

33:28.669 --> 33:32.004
in the hood, she's got... she's
got to take me s-seriously.

33:32.006 --> 33:34.640
Did you ransack my place
looking for it?

33:34.642 --> 33:35.941
I need it, Destro.

33:35.943 --> 33:38.544
They're talking about it
on the streets

33:38.546 --> 33:42.014
and in the news.
She sees me in it, and I'm...
No!

33:42.016 --> 33:44.950
We have one last job before
we split up and skip town.

33:50.290 --> 33:52.191
(gun cocks)

33:52.193 --> 33:53.926
You have it on you, don't you?

33:53.928 --> 33:56.996
You better use that thing

33:56.998 --> 33:59.131
before I make you eat it.

34:01.101 --> 34:02.434
(gunshot)

34:06.873 --> 34:08.940
(door creaking)

34:11.043 --> 34:14.313
(gasping weakly)
He's alive.

34:15.415 --> 34:16.882
(stairs rattling)

34:16.884 --> 34:18.284
Who shot you, Destro?
Give us the name

34:18.286 --> 34:20.286
of the guy.
I need an ambulance.

34:20.288 --> 34:22.588
We'll get to that. Give us the
names of the guys in your crew.

34:22.590 --> 34:24.456
I'm bleeding out.

34:24.458 --> 34:25.757
Yeah, you're dying.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.726
And, unfortunately, I'm not
getting cell reception.

34:27.728 --> 34:28.928
You know what might help?

34:28.929 --> 34:31.063
Giving us the names of the guys
in your crew!

34:31.065 --> 34:32.398
GORDON:
I need an ambulance.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.266
Java Heights and Homewood,
apartment 466.

34:34.268 --> 34:37.536
I might need some pressure
on this wound.

34:37.538 --> 34:38.538
Knock yourself out.

34:38.539 --> 34:40.072
(panting)

34:41.041 --> 34:44.043
