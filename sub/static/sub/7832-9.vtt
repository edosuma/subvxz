Well, your dive wasn't bad,

I mean, you gotta sell it. Remember, your ''No!''
is what gets you your next job.

And then Apu gave the mayor
lots of change for-

- Dad, don't you see what's going on?
- That ''change'' was a bribe.

11:26.118 --> 11:29.383
Oh, honey, don't be so naive.
That's how the world works.

11:29.488 --> 11:34.425
Sure the mayor takes a few bribes,
but he also makes the trains run on time.

11:34.527 --> 11:39.157
No, he doesn't. Trains are regulated by
the federal Department ofTransportation.

11:39.265 --> 11:41.165

However, in the future...

12:04.757 --> 12:09.217
I would prefer a nondescript briefcase to
the sack with a dollar sign on it.
