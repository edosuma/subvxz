00:01.646 --> 00:03.271
[Rosen]: I see a car in my rear view
mirror.

00:03.391 --> 00:05.542
I hear footsteps behind me.
I turn around and they're gone.

00:05.662 --> 00:07.303
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

00:07.371 --> 00:08.905
She could be getting into something
possibly dangerous.

00:09.025 --> 00:09.609
With work.

00:09.729 --> 00:11.407
So Albatross, the mole,
the man who killed Wendy...

00:11.474 --> 00:13.875
he's the one who leaked
their names to the terrorists.

00:13.943 --> 00:15.277
(Olivia) You can't tell anyone
it came from me,

00:15.345 --> 00:16.978
and you can't bring it
to the C.I.A.

00:17.047 --> 00:19.181
An anonymous source sent them
to my office this morning.

00:19.249 --> 00:20.782
That meeting isn't
on my schedule.

00:20.850 --> 00:22.351
It's so late at night
and three times a week.

00:22.419 --> 00:23.919
Who is it?

00:23.986 --> 00:25.620
He's not cheating on me, Cy.
He's cheating on you.

00:25.688 --> 00:27.988
The mole is not in the agency.
The C.I.A. Is clean on this.

00:28.057 --> 00:29.390
Thank you, Osborne.

00:29.458 --> 00:31.182
(Quinn) He can't know
we're on to him.

00:36.830 --> 00:39.899
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

00:41.969 --> 00:44.270
His name's Jake Ballard.

00:44.337 --> 00:45.971
He's a naval intelligence
officer

00:46.039 --> 00:47.506
with the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

00:47.574 --> 00:49.341
Put him under the microscope,
see what you find.

00:49.409 --> 00:51.643
- The more dirt, the better.
- It'd help to know why I'm doing this.

00:51.711 --> 00:52.744
He sleeping with
your husband?

00:52.812 --> 00:55.914
In a manner of speaking, yes.

00:58.318 --> 01:00.619
So this source of yours...
The one who gave you

01:00.687 --> 01:03.021
the fax transmissions
on the Kashfari hostages...

01:03.089 --> 01:04.790
Yeah?

01:04.857 --> 01:06.992
You think there's more
blood in that stone?

01:07.060 --> 01:08.894
(Pouring) There might be.
Why do you ask?

01:08.962 --> 01:10.762
I want you to look into it.

01:10.830 --> 01:12.631
Me? Don't you have a building
in Langley that does that?

01:12.699 --> 01:14.466
I do, but so far
all they've done

01:14.533 --> 01:16.333
is rule themselves out
as the leak.

01:16.401 --> 01:18.368
- You need some backup.
- I need some backup.

01:18.436 --> 01:20.170
Someone I can trust.

01:20.238 --> 01:23.474
Which these days...
it's a very short list.

01:23.541 --> 01:27.678
And who knows?
If things go well,

01:27.746 --> 01:29.346
maybe we find a place
for you here

01:29.414 --> 01:30.982
that's a little more official.

01:36.153 --> 01:38.421
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

01:40.124 --> 01:43.026
(Keys jangling)

01:43.094 --> 01:44.460
(Clicks switch)

01:47.464 --> 01:48.664
(Sets down briefcase)

01:51.001 --> 01:53.135

01:53.202 --> 01:55.437

01:55.505 --> 01:57.172

02:02.846 --> 02:04.411

02:13.473 --> 02:15.207
So I've been thinking...

02:15.274 --> 02:17.742
about your family.

02:17.810 --> 02:19.910
It's just it's been a while
since you had one

02:19.978 --> 02:23.214
- to, you know, watch.
- Slow down.

02:23.281 --> 02:24.275
What? The speed limit is like...

02:24.395 --> 02:25.730
You have to keep at least
100 feet between us and them.

02:25.850 --> 02:27.951
Slow down.
(Sighs)

02:28.020 --> 02:31.055
Anyway, I just thought
maybe we could find you

02:31.123 --> 02:32.589
a new family.

02:32.657 --> 02:34.892
Look, I know they were
special, Huck,

02:34.959 --> 02:36.526
but every family's special
in their own little way,

02:36.593 --> 02:38.194
- don't you think?
- He's turning left.

02:38.262 --> 02:40.563
Next street.
And don't forget to signal.

02:40.631 --> 02:42.132
When you don't signal,
it draws attention.

02:42.199 --> 02:44.634
(Clicks lever, signal clicking)

02:46.370 --> 02:49.039
(Breathes sharply)
So, what do you say?

02:49.106 --> 02:51.007
I say we've been following
Osborne for a week,

02:51.074 --> 02:52.974
and he hasn't made a drop
the entire time,

02:53.043 --> 02:55.077
hasn't been to
the dry cleaners even once,

02:55.145 --> 02:56.711
and he's driving
a new route tonight,

02:56.779 --> 02:58.680
which is very, very strange.

02:58.748 --> 03:01.383
So, what do you see?

03:01.451 --> 03:02.884
Osborne's on his way
to a new drop?

03:02.952 --> 03:04.486
Mnh-mnh.

03:04.554 --> 03:06.321
- We've been made?
- We've been made.

03:06.389 --> 03:08.456
We haven't been made. What makes
you think we've been made?

03:08.524 --> 03:09.658
You see that apartment
building up ahead?

03:09.725 --> 03:12.561
- Yeah. Wait, isn't that...
- Olivia's.

03:12.628 --> 03:15.196
- We've been made.
- We've been made.

03:15.264 --> 03:17.365
(Chimes)

03:20.302 --> 03:23.571
<i>(Rustling on TV)</i>

03:25.273 --> 03:26.740
<i>(Clatters)</i>

03:26.808 --> 03:28.876
<i>(Knock on door)</i>

03:31.780 --> 03:33.246
(Sighs)

03:37.886 --> 03:39.820
<i>Director Osborne.</i>
<i>To what do I owe...</i>

03:39.888 --> 03:41.354
- Who hired you?
- Excuse me?

03:41.422 --> 03:42.956
You're having me followed.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.125
Unless you have a crush on me,
I assume there's a reason.

03:45.193 --> 03:46.593
What's the reason?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.295
<i>Director Osborne,</i>
<i>all due respect...</i>

03:48.362 --> 03:50.863
<i>Who hired you?!</i>
<i>(Static blips)</i>

03:55.970 --> 03:57.869
Do you really think we don't
have a file on you?

03:57.937 --> 04:00.072
The woman who's had her finger
in every pile of dirt

04:00.140 --> 04:02.408
that gets dumped on this town? It's a
damned encyclopedia. (Phone clicks)

04:02.476 --> 04:04.210
Yes, I'd like to report
a break-in.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.313
I asked you a question,

04:07.380 --> 04:08.914
and I am waiting for an answer.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.117
Check my file.

04:11.184 --> 04:13.585
Half my clients have
your pay grade or higher,

04:13.652 --> 04:16.321
which means half my clients
would happily intervene

04:16.387 --> 04:18.189
on my behalf and kick your ass

04:18.257 --> 04:20.158
in whatever special way
their office allows,

04:20.226 --> 04:21.926
which is why I suggest,
Director Osborne,

04:21.994 --> 04:23.895
you leave my apartment
immediately.

04:25.564 --> 04:26.897
This isn't over.

04:34.305 --> 04:37.807
(Exhales)

04:37.875 --> 04:41.245
(Knock on door)

04:41.312 --> 04:42.746
(Sighs) - Oh...
- Are you okay?

04:42.813 --> 04:45.881
Yeah. (Sighs)

04:45.949 --> 04:50.386
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

04:50.454 --> 04:51.820
- Wow.
- Yeah.

04:51.888 --> 04:53.589
Really? Nowhere else to put him?
He's safest here.

04:53.657 --> 04:55.324
Oh, come on!

04:55.392 --> 04:56.659
David walked into
someone ransacking

04:56.726 --> 04:58.827
his apartment last night.
Oh, God, is he...

04:58.895 --> 05:01.563
Fine. Shaken but fine.

05:01.631 --> 05:03.465
Do you think it was Osborne
looking for the flash drive?

05:03.533 --> 05:05.066
I think Osborne sent someone
else to do his dirty work,

05:05.134 --> 05:07.869
because last night the man was
too busy threatening me.

05:07.936 --> 05:09.304
- So he's on to us?
- He's on to us.

05:09.372 --> 05:11.273
- So what next?
- We lie low. We back off.

05:11.340 --> 05:13.107
We don't take on the director
of the C.I.A.

05:13.176 --> 05:14.709
without solid proof
he's the mole.

05:14.777 --> 05:16.943
In the meantime,
we have a client coming in.

05:17.011 --> 05:19.146
(Harrison sighs
and clears throat)

05:19.214 --> 05:21.415
- Who's the client?
- You've been on an all-night stakeout.

05:21.483 --> 05:23.884
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

05:23.951 --> 05:25.252
I'm not tired.
I can work.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.920
Wait... who's the client?

05:26.988 --> 05:28.955
(Door opens)
I'd apologize for being late,

05:29.023 --> 05:30.591
but, hell, I'm not that tardy, and
I ain't that sorry. (Door closes)

05:30.659 --> 05:33.059
Darlin', if you'd do me
the kindness

05:33.126 --> 05:36.896
and rustle ol' Hollis up
a coffee black as Texas crude

05:36.963 --> 05:38.531
with three sugars sweet as you,

05:38.599 --> 05:40.633
I'd be much obliged.

05:40.701 --> 05:43.336
This is my favorite ex-wife
Debora.

05:43.404 --> 05:46.072
All he would tell me is you're
a bunch of specialized lawyers.

05:46.139 --> 05:49.739
Don't think for one second I'm
renegotiating the divorce contract.

05:49.859 --> 05:51.302
You deserve every penny,
Honey.

05:51.422 --> 05:54.213
I'm afraid we got a whole other
cat to skin.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.347
Please, daddy.
(Crying)

05:56.415 --> 05:59.517
Just do what he says or he
swears he's gonna kill me.

05:59.585 --> 06:01.953
(Crying)

06:02.021 --> 06:03.755
He wants you...

06:03.823 --> 06:05.857
he wants you to wire
$20 million

06:05.925 --> 06:07.792
to this routing number
and account number...

06:07.860 --> 06:09.460
<i>(Train passing faintly</i>
<i>in distance)</i>

06:09.528 --> 06:12.362
Or he swears you'll never
see me again.

06:12.430 --> 06:15.032
(Sobbing)

06:15.100 --> 06:17.634
He says...

06:17.702 --> 06:19.203
he says if you go
to the police,

06:19.270 --> 06:21.705
you'll never see me again.

06:21.773 --> 06:23.774
He says if you do anything
other than what he's asking,

06:23.842 --> 06:25.575
you'll never see me again.

06:25.643 --> 06:28.410
(Sobbing)

06:28.478 --> 06:30.479
Please, daddy.

06:30.547 --> 06:33.616
I'm so scared.
I just want to come home.

06:33.683 --> 06:36.252
Just do what he says,
or else he'll hurt me!

06:36.319 --> 06:38.621
Help...
<i>(Static crackling)</i>

06:40.624 --> 06:43.259
Only thing she forgot to do
is thank the damn academy.

06:43.326 --> 06:44.793
What is the matter with you?

06:44.861 --> 06:46.594
Y'all weren't buying
that little performance?

06:46.662 --> 06:48.764
That there is nothing more
than the fruits

06:48.831 --> 06:52.801
of the six years of film school,
acting class, scene study,

06:52.869 --> 06:55.003
and whatever in hell else
Maybelle wanted to take

06:55.071 --> 06:56.537
and I was a damn fool
to pay for.

06:56.605 --> 06:58.073
I had myself a good ol' laugh

06:58.141 --> 07:00.274
when I got it in my mail
last night.

07:00.341 --> 07:03.177
You have been sitting on this
since last night?

07:03.245 --> 07:06.413
Our daughter, our... baby
has been kidnapped,

07:06.481 --> 07:09.116
and you waited 12 hours
to tell anyone?!

07:09.184 --> 07:10.785
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking) Maybelle Doyle, 25,

07:10.852 --> 07:12.253
youngest of Hollis'
eight children

07:12.320 --> 07:14.121
and only daughter with his
fourth ex-wife,

07:14.189 --> 07:16.389
Manhattan power player
Debora Clarkson.

07:16.456 --> 07:18.424
Apple fall far from the tree?
Evil tree, rotten apple.

07:18.492 --> 07:20.794
Imagine a pretty, young,
spoiled Hollis Doyle

07:20.861 --> 07:23.062
on pills and coke and speed.

07:23.130 --> 07:25.665
Darlin', our baby
is a drug addict,

07:25.732 --> 07:27.466
a user who's trying
to bleed me dry,

07:27.534 --> 07:29.568
and the only way left since
I cut her off without a cent

07:29.636 --> 07:31.204
after that... what was it now?
Fourth?

07:31.272 --> 07:33.772
No, fifth stint in rehab.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.540
So you don't believe
your daughter was kidnapped?

07:35.608 --> 07:37.442
- No, sir, I do not.
(Debora) - How can...

07:37.510 --> 07:39.278
You saw that video.
She's not lying.

07:39.345 --> 07:40.712
She's terrified.

07:40.780 --> 07:44.249
Hollis, I advise you take
a moment to fully consider.

07:44.317 --> 07:46.518
Ain't nothing to consider,
ponder, or cogitate on.

07:46.585 --> 07:48.953
That child has bled me dry
her whole life.

07:49.021 --> 07:50.587
Now she's just at it again,

07:50.655 --> 07:52.523
on a bigger scale
with fancier dramatics.

07:52.590 --> 07:54.692
After getting kicked out
of Georgetown for cheating,

07:54.759 --> 07:56.294
daddy bought her a big, fancy
penthouse next door

07:56.361 --> 07:57.962
to keep her out of trouble...
And it worked for a while.

07:58.030 --> 08:00.331
Then Maybelle met Justin
Turner at a club.

08:00.398 --> 08:01.899
Just as rich,
just as useless.

08:01.967 --> 08:03.834
They started dealing,
forging checks, stealing cars.

08:03.901 --> 08:06.536
Think Bonnie and Clyde
on pills and coke and speed.

08:06.603 --> 08:08.238
Even it wasn't a hoax,
I got me eight kids

08:08.306 --> 08:09.706
with five wives.

08:09.773 --> 08:12.375
If I paid up, they'd just
come take the rest.

08:12.443 --> 08:13.743
Pretty soon I'd be stuck
working the drive-thru

08:13.811 --> 08:16.146
at Gettysburger
just to pay ransoms.

08:16.214 --> 08:18.448
This is not hypothetical.
This is happening.

08:18.515 --> 08:20.149
This is our daughter!

08:20.217 --> 08:22.417
Miss Pope, please.

08:22.485 --> 08:25.254
Our hands are tied if we
can't go to the authorities.

08:25.322 --> 08:27.022
We'll do our best to get
your daughter home safely,

08:27.090 --> 08:28.557
but I'm gonna need you
to cooperate.

08:28.624 --> 08:31.493
Hollis, I need your full
participation in this.

08:31.561 --> 08:33.128
Oh, don't get me wrong.

08:33.196 --> 08:35.297
- I want y'all to get my Maybelle back.
- But?

08:35.365 --> 08:38.732
But... it'll be a cold day
in hell

08:38.799 --> 08:41.890
before I pay one red cent
for that gal's heinie.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here

08:54.854 --> 08:57.422
- We have a men's room.
- Same pipes. What's the difference?

08:57.489 --> 08:59.257
I really need to explain to you
why you spitting your plaque

08:59.325 --> 09:01.759
and your food bits all over
my kitchen is a problem?

09:01.828 --> 09:03.228
You need to explain to me
why the devil

09:03.296 --> 09:05.230
- is suddenly our client.
- He needs help.

09:07.398 --> 09:09.366
It's the Christian thing to do.

09:09.434 --> 09:12.236
- Gladiator.
- Suit. (Breathes sharply) Yeah.

09:12.304 --> 09:14.138
Yeah, I know.

09:14.206 --> 09:16.140
- What the hell does that mean?

It only runs above ground

the warehouse locations

09:48.004 --> 09:49.471

always the ex-boyfriend.

09:59.481 --> 10:01.382
Thanks for the heads-up.

10:01.449 --> 10:03.084
The boyfriend Justin's
been M.I.A. six months,

10:03.151 --> 10:05.019
- ever since he left lockup.
- No sign he was here.

10:05.087 --> 10:06.720
None of the prints
I found matched his.

10:06.788 --> 10:08.089
He could have been
wearing gloves.

10:08.156 --> 10:09.623
Plus, I mean,
look at this mess.

10:09.691 --> 10:11.491

10:25.906 --> 10:27.206
(Sighs) Oh...

10:27.274 --> 10:28.908
He is spending his evenings
with a soldier,

10:28.975 --> 10:31.343
a man you and I have
never met or heard of.

10:31.411 --> 10:33.145
I'm looking into it,
but right now... (Sighs)

10:33.213 --> 10:35.180
- There's a snake in the garden, Cy.
- I don't know anything yet.

10:35.248 --> 10:36.916
A garden that we planted
and we cultivated

10:36.983 --> 10:39.318
- and we harvested.
- I do not know anything yet.

10:39.386 --> 10:41.620
Do I have to take care
of this myself?

10:41.687 --> 10:46.457
I don't know anything yet.
Yet. <i>Yet!</i>

10:46.525 --> 10:48.026
(Sighs) (Lowered voice)
I'm simply saying

10:48.093 --> 10:49.961
I realize that you are not
in the best position

10:50.029 --> 10:52.363
- with him right now.
(Lowered voice) - Yes, I am

10:52.431 --> 10:54.265
currently on the outside looking in.
(Sighs)

10:54.333 --> 10:57.368
My nose is pressed up
to the glass of life

10:57.436 --> 10:59.870
right now, and I want
to thank <i>you</i> for that.

10:59.938 --> 11:01.505
I do. Because, you know,

11:01.573 --> 11:04.141
it reminded me never
to let my guard down,

11:04.208 --> 11:06.343
not when something Mellie
this way comes.

11:06.411 --> 11:07.912
But don't you worry about me.

11:07.979 --> 11:09.580
I will once again
be his warrior.

11:09.648 --> 11:13.183
I will once again sit at
the right hand of the father.

11:13.251 --> 11:15.017
I'm on it, my guard is up,

11:15.085 --> 11:17.386
and as a friend of mine
likes to say, it's handled.

11:19.356 --> 11:22.224
He says the kids are
coming down this weekend,

11:22.292 --> 11:24.727
which is funny, since
the Secret Service

11:24.795 --> 11:26.896
doesn't have any travel
for the kids on their roster.

11:26.964 --> 11:31.600
That feels like a thing
you should be taking care of.

11:38.975 --> 11:41.042
Did you need something?

11:41.110 --> 11:44.212
I am, um, heading to bed.

11:44.280 --> 11:45.380
Good night.

11:47.282 --> 11:49.116
You know,
I wanted to mention...

11:49.184 --> 11:50.685
it might be hard for Jerry
and Karen to get away

11:50.752 --> 11:52.620
- from boarding school this weekend.
- It'll be fine.

11:52.688 --> 11:54.121
We put in the request
a month ago.

11:54.189 --> 11:56.891
No, I know, just...
with classes.

11:56.959 --> 11:59.126
Karen has a paper,
and Jerry has Lacrosse,

11:59.194 --> 12:00.728
and they were just here
for the holidays,

12:00.796 --> 12:01.963
and before that to see Teddy...

12:02.030 --> 12:05.198
We are going to play tennis
all weekend.

12:05.265 --> 12:06.867
Well, they are.
I'll coach.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.635
Can't very well play tennis
and hold the baby

12:08.703 --> 12:10.003
at the same time.

12:12.406 --> 12:14.140
Tennis. That sounds...

12:14.208 --> 12:15.375
You don't have to worry
about it.

12:15.442 --> 12:17.043
No one expects you to join us.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.145
Family activities aren't
your thing, I know.

12:22.516 --> 12:24.384
<i>(Olivia) Director Osborne.</i>
<i>To what do I owe...</i>

12:24.451 --> 12:26.052

<i>You're having me followed.</i>

12:27.821 --> 12:30.356

12:50.676 --> 12:51.677
What about Alexandria?

12:51.797 --> 12:53.244
There's some warehouses near the
King Street stop.

12:53.364 --> 12:53.874
 Good idea.

12:53.994 --> 12:55.046
We'll check there
after Greenbelt.

12:55.113 --> 12:56.547
Or, just thinking
outside the box,

12:56.614 --> 12:58.248
you could save gas and time
and maybe this girl's life

12:58.315 --> 13:00.383
if you get the F.B.I.
to look for you.

13:00.451 --> 13:02.986
First of all, we're so much better
than the F.B.I. at this. (Door opens)

13:03.054 --> 13:05.255
Secondly... here's your
fourscore, extra bacon,

13:05.322 --> 13:07.190
and your hushpuppies,
of course.

13:07.258 --> 13:08.525
And here's the rest
of the mail...

13:08.593 --> 13:09.693
mostly invitations
to fund raisers...

13:09.761 --> 13:10.761
Have we ruled out Takoma Park?

13:10.828 --> 13:12.395
It's too residential.

13:12.463 --> 13:13.763
And it doesn't look like
there are any stops

13:13.830 --> 13:15.598
on the Red Line that go near
a Warehouse District.

13:15.666 --> 13:17.967
- This package came for you.
- My hands are awful busy, darlin'.

13:18.035 --> 13:19.602
Well, that's all right.
Wouldn't be the first time

13:19.670 --> 13:21.270
you leant your boss a hand,
right, Trixie?

13:21.337 --> 13:23.172
This warehouse is like
a needle in a haystack.

13:23.239 --> 13:25.474
The police have software
that can location map

13:25.542 --> 13:27.209
everything down to a crack
in the sidewalk.

13:27.277 --> 13:29.143
And that would take three days.
She'd be dead by then.

13:29.211 --> 13:30.845
Have we pulled up maps...
(Trixie screams)

13:30.913 --> 13:32.547
(Screams and gasps)

13:32.615 --> 13:33.848
- What's going on?
- Oh, my...

13:33.916 --> 13:35.383
- I touched it!
- Is that...

13:35.451 --> 13:36.484
(Huck) - That's an...
- I touched it!

13:39.188 --> 13:40.138
Ear.

13:48.671 --> 13:49.972
This is Olivia Pope.

13:50.039 --> 13:51.921
I'll be negotiating
on behalf of the Doyle family.

13:52.041 --> 13:53.274
<i>(Maybelle on speaker)</i>
<i>Daddy, why didn't you pay him?</i>

13:53.342 --> 13:54.809
<i>You saw what he did to me!</i>

13:54.877 --> 13:56.276
(Olivia) You're gonna
have to talk to me, Maybelle.

13:56.344 --> 13:59.661
Whoever has you, you tell them
you're only talking to me.

13:59.781 --> 14:01.014
<i>He cut off my ear!</i>

14:01.081 --> 14:02.649
Afraid I'll need
to see some proof.

14:02.717 --> 14:03.884
Proof? Are you insane?

14:03.951 --> 14:05.852
Maybelle, we're going
to need proof.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.321
<i>He's saying... (Panting)</i>

14:08.389 --> 14:09.923
<i>He... he says...</i>

14:09.990 --> 14:12.325
Maybelle, what does he say?

14:12.393 --> 14:15.327
<i>(Sobbing) He says that you</i>
<i>need to pay up in 24 hours,</i>

14:15.395 --> 14:18.063
<i>or else I'm going to lose</i>
<i>something less cosmetic!</i>

14:18.131 --> 14:19.899
<i>(Sobbing)</i>

14:19.966 --> 14:22.167
<i>Once the money is wired</i>
<i>into his account,</i>

14:22.235 --> 14:25.203
<i>then he'll call and he'll</i>
<i>tell you where I am.</i>

14:25.271 --> 14:28.407
<i>(Sobbing) Please,</i>
<i>daddy, please.</i>

14:28.474 --> 14:32.343
<i>This time, just listen to me...</i>
(Line clicks, dial tone)

14:32.411 --> 14:36.948
(Beep) (Gasps and sobbing)

14:37.015 --> 14:40.017
I'm telling y'all
that's not her ear!

14:40.085 --> 14:44.322
- Wh-where would Maybelle get a human ear?
- Addicts are resourceful.

14:44.389 --> 14:46.790
Hollis, you have to consider
the risk if you're wrong.

14:46.858 --> 14:48.592
I tell you what.
Get me a D.N.A. test.

14:48.660 --> 14:52.268
A D.N.A. test takes
48 hours minimum. We have 24.

14:52.388 --> 14:54.230
That's y'all's problem.
I don't pony up any money

14:54.298 --> 14:55.866
till I have proof
that's her ear.

14:55.934 --> 14:58.168
You just killed our daughter.

14:58.235 --> 15:01.771
Are you happy?
You just killed our baby!

15:01.839 --> 15:03.673
Our daughter's nothing more
than a spoiled brat

15:03.740 --> 15:05.174
who wants to get her hands
on my money!

15:05.241 --> 15:06.676
If you think I'm gonna
give it to her,

15:06.743 --> 15:08.811
- you're crazier than she is!
- Charming family.

15:08.879 --> 15:10.880
- Okay.
- Seriously.

15:10.948 --> 15:12.715
Not trying to sound like
a broken record here,

15:12.783 --> 15:14.083
but isn't this the time
to call the police,

15:14.150 --> 15:15.918
bring in the F.B.I.?

15:15.986 --> 15:17.486
We're dealing with a class "A" felony.
(Laughs)

15:17.553 --> 15:19.554
(Huck) - It's just math.
- Math?

15:19.622 --> 15:21.957
You hire us, we negotiate
the ransom,

15:22.024 --> 15:23.358
make an untraceable payment,

15:23.425 --> 15:24.860
retrieve the victim
safe and sound.

15:24.927 --> 15:26.461
We've never lost a client,
not once.

15:26.529 --> 15:28.196
You call the cops,
you get a rescue team,

15:28.263 --> 15:29.764
dogs, body armor, the works.

15:29.832 --> 15:31.132
Now, you don't spend
any of your own money,

15:31.200 --> 15:33.701
but the victim's chance
of survival drops to 50%

15:33.768 --> 15:35.335
in a rescue scenario.

15:35.403 --> 15:37.037
So, if I wanted to see
my loved one alive,

15:37.105 --> 15:39.239
I wouldn't call the cops,
I'd call us.

15:39.307 --> 15:41.642
Every time. (Hollis and
Debora arguing indistinctly)

15:41.710 --> 15:44.311
Hey, Liv.
Let me ask you a question.

15:44.379 --> 15:45.746
Why are we helping Doyle?

15:45.814 --> 15:48.215
Why is the devil our client?

15:48.282 --> 15:52.852
Because even the devil
loves his kids.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.073
Ma'am.
(Sighs)

15:58.141 --> 15:59.941
How can I help you today?

16:00.009 --> 16:02.278
I'm going to need you to change
Fitz's schedule this weekend.

16:02.345 --> 16:03.779
Oh, no need to worry,
Mrs. grant.

16:03.846 --> 16:05.080
I have already completely
cleared it

16:05.148 --> 16:06.781
so he can spend time
with the children.

16:06.848 --> 16:07.915
That's lovely.
And thoughtful.

16:07.983 --> 16:09.684
But now I need you
to unclear it.

16:09.752 --> 16:11.152
- Ma'am?
- He's a busy man.

16:11.219 --> 16:12.620
He runs the greatest
nation on earth.

16:12.688 --> 16:14.188
Surely he has things
he could be doing.

16:14.256 --> 16:16.391
Well, he always has things
he <i>could</i> be doing...

16:16.458 --> 16:17.625
Put them on his schedule
this weekend.

16:17.693 --> 16:20.227
Yes, ma'am.

16:20.296 --> 16:22.128
(Lowered voice) Are you
keeping bad news from him

16:22.196 --> 16:23.930
in an effort to stay
on his good side?

16:23.998 --> 16:25.399
(Lowered voice)
I would think you have

16:25.466 --> 16:27.133
enough problems of your own
to worry about

16:27.201 --> 16:29.969
without meddling
in our private family affairs.

16:33.274 --> 16:34.541

clicking)

16:34.609 --> 16:37.443

16:37.511 --> 16:40.014
(Clicks and beeps)
Cyrus, I can't talk.

16:40.134 --> 16:40.764
Why not?

16:40.884 --> 16:43.514
Because Hollis Doyle's
daughter's been kidnapped.

16:45.452 --> 16:46.552
Karma.

16:46.620 --> 16:48.721
You are a bad man.

16:48.789 --> 16:50.255
Just take a moment to feel
the karma.

16:50.324 --> 16:51.424
Good-bye, Cyrus.

16:51.491 --> 16:53.391
(Clicks and beeps)

16:53.459 --> 16:56.461
(Chimes) (Sighing)

16:56.529 --> 16:58.062
Jake, how are you?

16:58.130 --> 16:59.531
I was just wondering
what you were up to.

16:59.598 --> 17:00.799
I thought maybe we could
grab some lunch.

17:00.866 --> 17:03.301
I'd love to, but I can't.
I'm in the middle

17:03.369 --> 17:05.537
of something at work.
Maybe later, when I'm home?

17:05.604 --> 17:07.905
Yeah, maybe later,
when you're home. (Beeps)

17:10.876 --> 17:13.243

17:13.311 --> 17:15.779

17:19.617 --> 17:21.719
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

17:23.821 --> 17:25.589
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

17:30.061 --> 17:31.061
(Opens drawer)

17:32.897 --> 17:34.564
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

17:41.138 --> 17:43.906
(Beeps)

17:43.974 --> 17:46.008
These documents came from
a flash drive that,

17:46.076 --> 17:49.411
until very recently, I believe
was in Osborne's possession.

17:49.479 --> 17:51.546
The level of security clearance
required to access

17:51.614 --> 17:54.216
this information belongs
to a handful of people...

17:54.284 --> 17:57.052
You, Secretary of Defense,
the Vice President,

17:57.120 --> 17:58.253
and Osborne.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.687
Why do you assume it's Osborne?

17:59.755 --> 18:03.124
Because I saw him
threatening my source.

18:03.192 --> 18:05.059
You're not gonna tell me
who the source is, are you?

18:05.127 --> 18:06.427
No, sir, I'm not.

18:06.495 --> 18:08.930
I know this is a big gamble.

18:08.998 --> 18:11.599
But consider the damage
a guy like Osborne can do,

18:11.666 --> 18:13.334
especially if we drag
our feet on this.

18:13.402 --> 18:15.402
You trust this source?

18:15.469 --> 18:16.803
They brought home
the hostages, didn't they?

18:18.439 --> 18:20.307
You asked me to do a job.

18:20.375 --> 18:21.641
I did it.

18:21.709 --> 18:24.477
And I am telling you,
Grayden Osborne is your mole.

18:26.614 --> 18:28.681
(Train whirring)

18:28.749 --> 18:29.907
So?

18:30.027 --> 18:32.118
- Not the kidnapper's building.
- And why?

18:32.185 --> 18:33.886
It doesn't match the video.
The windows don't open.

18:33.954 --> 18:35.888
Very good.

18:35.956 --> 18:38.124
(Door opens) Hey...

18:38.191 --> 18:39.892
How about them?

18:39.960 --> 18:41.294
They live in an apartment.

18:41.361 --> 18:42.861
So? Nice families
live in apartments.

18:42.930 --> 18:44.630
Ah, no yard, no dog.

18:44.697 --> 18:46.898
They got a little dog.
It doesn't need a yard.

18:46.966 --> 18:48.300
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

18:48.367 --> 18:50.302
(Scoffs) That is not a dog.

18:50.369 --> 18:51.736
You're never gonna find
the perfect family.

18:51.804 --> 18:54.672
Perfect families don't exist.

18:54.740 --> 18:57.309
(Musical ringtone)
Hey, new message!

18:57.376 --> 18:59.177
And there's an attachment.
Pull it up on the TV.

18:59.245 --> 19:01.179
(Typing)

19:01.247 --> 19:02.679
(Gasps) Oh, God!

19:02.747 --> 19:05.316
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

19:05.383 --> 19:06.616
(Debora gasps)

19:06.684 --> 19:08.986
Well, it was definitely
her ear.

19:09.054 --> 19:11.021
(Panting)

19:11.089 --> 19:13.557
(Huck) Plaid curtains,
Western sunlight,

19:13.624 --> 19:15.459
electrical transformer
across the street.

19:15.526 --> 19:17.461
Just like in the video.
So where's Maybelle?

19:17.528 --> 19:19.728
I don't know, but she was
definitely here.

19:21.065 --> 19:22.932
Pay 'em.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.850
Pay 'em. Pay 'em
whatever they want.

19:24.970 --> 19:26.833
- It doesn't work like that, Hollis.
- You hear me?

19:26.953 --> 19:30.039
Pay them son of a bitches,
get my baby back here now!

19:36.118 --> 19:37.419
We're all set up to wire
the money

19:37.487 --> 19:39.598
via electronic transfer
to the account number.

19:39.898 --> 19:41.382
However...
(Turns off TV)

19:41.502 --> 19:43.759
- We're only sending half of it.
- What?

19:43.879 --> 19:45.192
If we give him
everything he's asking for,

19:45.260 --> 19:46.660
you'll never see Maybelle
again.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.796
He's already proven
he means business with the ear,

19:48.863 --> 19:50.530
and it's a cleaner getaway
if there aren't any witnesses

19:50.598 --> 19:52.899
- to testify against him.
- So what do we do?

19:52.933 --> 19:54.901
To get her back?
What do we do?

19:54.968 --> 19:57.203
Pay half up front,
then wire the rest of it

19:57.271 --> 19:59.839
only when we see she's alive
and we can assure her safety.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.541
I say we wire the whole
enchilada, get this over with!

20:02.609 --> 20:04.110
With all due respect,
I'm not looking for your advice

20:04.178 --> 20:05.511
on how to handle this.

20:05.578 --> 20:07.545
I'm telling you
what my associates and I

20:07.613 --> 20:09.047
think the best way forward is.

20:09.115 --> 20:11.382
Is it risky? Yes.

20:11.417 --> 20:13.782
Welcome to kidnapping.

20:15.754 --> 20:17.856
Do it.

20:22.795 --> 20:24.962
(Typing continues)

20:25.030 --> 20:26.230
It's done.

20:26.298 --> 20:28.866
$10 million.

20:28.934 --> 20:30.301
(Voice breaking)
What if he doesn't call?

20:30.368 --> 20:32.236
He will.

20:32.304 --> 20:34.138
Just wait.

20:38.509 --> 20:40.743
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

20:40.811 --> 20:44.647
Is he dirty? Dirty? I don't know.
But I think I figured out

20:44.715 --> 20:46.916
how he and the president
know each other.

20:59.795 --> 21:01.496
What happened in Iran?

21:01.564 --> 21:02.664
What are you talking about?

21:02.732 --> 21:04.098
Operation Remington.

21:04.166 --> 21:05.767
It was '91,
the end of the Gulf war.

21:05.834 --> 21:08.002
Your plane went down
over Iranian airspace...

21:08.070 --> 21:10.572
Mountains west of Nurabad.
You were rescued.

21:10.606 --> 21:11.672
You've been looking into me?

21:11.773 --> 21:13.106
Mission report is redacted,

21:13.141 --> 21:14.875
even for my lofty level
of access.

21:14.942 --> 21:16.910
What, are you looking for dirt
on me so you can keep your job?

21:16.978 --> 21:18.712
Maybe it was a simple
extraction.

21:18.747 --> 21:20.947
A handful of special forces
and a couple of black hawks,

21:21.015 --> 21:22.182
and you were tucked
into your bunk

21:22.250 --> 21:23.717
just a few hours later.

21:23.785 --> 21:26.420
Or maybe... you got caught
in a village

21:26.488 --> 21:28.120
and had to fight your way out.

21:28.188 --> 21:29.589
Maybe it was My Lai, Iranian style.
(Sighs)

21:29.657 --> 21:31.391
Maybe things got ugly.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.459
- You want to stop playing games?
- I'm not playing any games.

21:33.527 --> 21:35.060
You want to know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.296
I don't care what happened.
I don't need to know.

21:36.363 --> 21:39.499
Point is, you did things.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.000
(Breathing heavily)

21:41.067 --> 21:42.468
Things you can't talk about.

21:42.536 --> 21:44.803
Heroic things you can't
put in your memoirs

21:44.870 --> 21:47.506
because it would endanger
our military operations,

21:47.573 --> 21:51.276
things that might even endanger
the foundation of the Republic.

21:51.344 --> 21:53.044
Who knows?
Well, guess what.

21:53.112 --> 21:54.879
(Breathes sharply)

21:54.947 --> 21:56.381
So did I.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.983
And just because
my battleground was in Ohio

21:59.051 --> 22:00.718
and not the Persian Gulf
doesn't make me

22:00.786 --> 22:02.953
any less of a patriot

22:03.021 --> 22:06.123
or make my <i>service</i>
any less valiant.

22:06.191 --> 22:08.526
And just like you, I can't
talk about that service,

22:08.593 --> 22:10.227
that operation,
because doing so

22:10.295 --> 22:13.263
would endanger the Republic
for which we stand.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.399
But still,
I can be proud of it.

22:15.467 --> 22:18.335
I am proud of it,
just as I hope you

22:18.402 --> 22:20.103
are proud
of Operation Remington.

22:20.171 --> 22:21.839
You are equating
what you did in Defiance

22:21.906 --> 22:23.874
with national security issues?

22:23.942 --> 22:25.775
I'm saying the right side
and the wrong side...

22:25.844 --> 22:27.644
(Breathing heavily)
Are determined not by me

22:27.712 --> 22:30.647
and not by you...

22:30.715 --> 22:32.315
but by history.

22:32.382 --> 22:35.517
History makes the heroes
and the villains, sir.

22:35.585 --> 22:38.520
You and I, we're just players.

22:45.229 --> 22:46.295
(Exhales)

22:50.566 --> 22:51.699
Sit down.

22:51.767 --> 22:53.468
Sir?

22:53.535 --> 22:55.503
Have a seat, Cy.

22:58.107 --> 23:00.308
(Exhales)

23:00.376 --> 23:01.943
I've ordered the F.B.I.

23:02.011 --> 23:03.711
To raid Grayden Osborne's
office and home

23:03.779 --> 23:06.046
to seize any and all
communications.

23:06.114 --> 23:07.547
Why?

23:07.615 --> 23:09.383
Osborne's our mole, Cy.

23:11.286 --> 23:14.288
I received some documentation

23:14.356 --> 23:17.057
with some highly classified
intelligence

23:17.125 --> 23:19.393
that only he and the Secretary
of Defense would have.

23:19.460 --> 23:22.195
(Typing)

23:22.263 --> 23:24.297
- No call?
- No call.

23:24.365 --> 23:26.366
(Sighs)

23:29.704 --> 23:33.607
(Sniffling)

23:38.412 --> 23:40.379
(Door closes, bottles clink)

23:42.549 --> 23:44.216
Drink?

23:44.284 --> 23:48.120
For the life of me,
I can't remember...

23:48.187 --> 23:50.088
when it happened.

23:50.156 --> 23:52.424
Even how.

23:52.491 --> 23:54.292
One day she's the love
of my life,

23:54.359 --> 23:57.595
my little sidekick,
my partner in crime.

23:57.663 --> 24:00.998
Just like that...

24:01.066 --> 24:02.767
she's my enemy.

24:04.603 --> 24:06.638
Can only assume
the worst of her.

24:06.705 --> 24:08.272
(Breathing unevenly)

24:08.340 --> 24:10.040
I let her down.

24:14.446 --> 24:16.012
(Voice breaking)
I let my baby down.

24:21.553 --> 24:24.220
(Musical ringtone)

24:28.659 --> 24:31.260
(Beeps) Maybelle, it's Olivia.

24:31.328 --> 24:32.795
<i>(Maybelle on speaker) He says</i>
<i>he doesn't have all the money!</i>

24:32.863 --> 24:34.163
<i>Where's the rest of the money?!</i>

24:34.230 --> 24:35.331
Maybelle, tell him he'll get
the rest

24:35.398 --> 24:36.799
upon confirmation of life.

24:36.867 --> 24:38.485
That's non-negotiable.

24:42.538 --> 24:45.306
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>He says that's okay.</i>

24:45.374 --> 24:47.909
<i>But no surprises, or...</i>
<i>(Sobbing)</i>

24:47.977 --> 24:50.211
<i>Oh, God, please don't hurt me! Please!
Aah!</i> Don't you touch her!

24:50.279 --> 24:51.880
Proof of life, and we wire you

24:51.948 --> 24:53.782
the second $10 million
on sight.

24:53.850 --> 24:55.951
- I'll give you the location where...
<i>- No!</i>

24:56.018 --> 24:58.352
<i>He says he chooses
where we go.</i>

24:58.419 --> 24:59.987
Okay.

25:00.054 --> 25:02.022
Give me the address.

25:05.494 --> 25:07.995
(Exhales)

25:08.062 --> 25:12.132
Maybelle, I need an address.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.934
<i>There's an old gas station</i>
<i>on Route 50</i>

25:15.002 --> 25:17.103
<i>between Aurora Pike</i>
<i>and Stemple Ridge Road.</i>

25:17.170 --> 25:21.774
<i>(Pants) He says...</i>

25:21.842 --> 25:24.143
<i>He says you have 20 minutes.</i>

25:28.915 --> 25:30.549
This is it.

25:33.285 --> 25:36.788
(Olivia) Here we are!
No authorities!

25:36.856 --> 25:39.324
As promised!

25:39.815 --> 25:41.832
Now it's your turn!

25:42.862 --> 25:44.829
(Rattling)

25:49.267 --> 25:50.902
Send it.
So she's there?

25:50.969 --> 25:52.003
(Taps key) She's still alive?

25:52.070 --> 25:54.005
Yeah. It's done.

25:54.072 --> 25:55.472
You have the money!
Now let her go!

25:55.541 --> 25:57.207
- He could have a gun on her.
- He could have a gun on us.

25:57.275 --> 25:59.076
Maybelle, it's okay.

25:59.144 --> 26:01.745
Walk towards me.
No one's gonna hurt you.

26:01.812 --> 26:04.014
He has his money.
You're free now.

26:04.081 --> 26:05.715
Walk towards me.
Let me go in.

26:05.783 --> 26:07.283
Easy, Huck. Come on.

26:07.351 --> 26:09.318
It's okay. You're free.
I can get this guy.

26:09.386 --> 26:10.486
Not our job.
Let me take...

26:10.555 --> 26:13.222
Huck, no! Come here, Maybelle.

26:13.290 --> 26:14.858
(Tires screech)

26:21.331 --> 26:23.679
If you want to, we can
still call the police.

26:23.799 --> 26:25.433
No, no.

26:25.501 --> 26:26.933
I'm just glad to have
my baby back.

26:27.001 --> 26:28.368
(Monitor beeping)

26:28.436 --> 26:31.069
I can't believe
Justin did this to me.

26:31.469 --> 26:33.283
I can't believe he took
your money.

26:33.403 --> 26:35.619
You're home safe now.
That's all that matters.

26:39.938 --> 26:41.455
(Softly) Thank you.

26:43.116 --> 26:45.284
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

26:45.351 --> 26:48.053
(Sighs)

26:48.121 --> 26:51.857
(Phone chimes)

26:51.925 --> 26:53.759
(Beeps)

26:53.827 --> 26:57.312
- Cyrus.
- I'll be there in 20. I was thinking

26:57.432 --> 26:58.228
a nice Napa red with a side

26:58.348 --> 26:59.631
              of stovetop popcorn.

26:59.698 --> 27:02.014
- We'll go old school tonight?
- I can't.

27:02.134 --> 27:04.401
I'm... I have plans.

27:04.469 --> 27:06.003
Is it a date? Who is he?

27:06.071 --> 27:09.173
You wouldn't know him.
I don't even know if I know him.

27:09.241 --> 27:12.536
There's something...
not quite right there,

27:12.656 --> 27:14.178
but I'm going with it,

27:14.246 --> 27:15.712
because God knows,
when it comes to men,

27:15.779 --> 27:17.380
my instincts haven't exactly
served me well.

27:17.448 --> 27:19.739
So I'm jumping.

27:20.451 --> 27:21.952
This is me jumping.

27:22.019 --> 27:24.254
Why is everybody cheating on me?

27:24.322 --> 27:25.606
You don't mean...

27:25.726 --> 27:27.903
Not James, of course not.
My other marriage.

27:28.023 --> 27:29.625
(Sighs)
But I think I'm back in.

27:29.693 --> 27:31.460
Now I just have to get rid
of the competition.

27:31.527 --> 27:32.895
Fitz is getting advice
from someone else?

27:32.963 --> 27:34.029
- Yep.
- Who?

27:34.097 --> 27:35.331
You don't know him.

27:35.398 --> 27:37.399
Go for the jugular.

27:37.467 --> 27:38.500
I always do.

27:40.403 --> 27:42.338
How is he?

27:44.507 --> 27:46.141
You have a date

27:46.209 --> 27:48.973
with a new guy, remember?

27:49.093 --> 27:50.945
(Exhales) Good-bye,
Cyrus.

27:51.013 --> 27:52.180
Good-bye, Liv.

27:52.248 --> 27:54.548
(Sighs)
(Phone beeps)

27:54.616 --> 27:56.918
(Exhales)

27:56.986 --> 27:58.920
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

28:00.923 --> 28:03.523
Well, you look incredible.
A little underdressed

28:03.591 --> 28:05.158
for a 5-star
dining experience, but...

28:05.226 --> 28:06.760
- I tried to call you.
- I know.

28:06.827 --> 28:08.262
I ignored the call.

28:09.830 --> 28:11.664
I don't think
I'm going to go.

28:11.732 --> 28:13.200
Two steps forward,
one step back.

28:13.268 --> 28:15.335
I have a lot of work to do,
and I'm really tired,

28:15.403 --> 28:17.337
- and I just...
- You are afraid.

28:17.405 --> 28:21.613
Of me. Of the unknown.
Of what this is.

28:23.110 --> 28:25.879
You seem like a really
great guy,

28:25.946 --> 28:27.547
and maybe I'm just...

28:30.584 --> 28:33.286
I had a relationship
with a man I thought was...

28:33.353 --> 28:35.154
(Breathes sharply)
and I'm not over it yet.

28:35.222 --> 28:37.255
I don't know how to judge
anymore what's good,

28:37.323 --> 28:39.357
what's bad, if I...

28:39.426 --> 28:41.593
someone mentioned him to me
on the phone five minutes ago,

28:41.661 --> 28:43.629
and I...

28:43.696 --> 28:45.831
I think about him.
I worry about him.

28:45.899 --> 28:49.234
I wouldn't be on a date
with you. I...

28:49.302 --> 28:52.202
H-he's in my head
all the time. (Chuckles)

28:52.270 --> 28:54.104
Close your eyes.
Wh-what?

28:54.172 --> 28:55.773
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

28:55.841 --> 28:57.675
You don't know me.

28:57.743 --> 28:59.744
I might be the worst guy
in the world.

28:59.812 --> 29:02.647
Or I might be the best.

29:02.714 --> 29:06.354
Whoever I am, I like you.
I like you a lot.

29:07.152 --> 29:08.552
I like how you say "What?"

29:08.619 --> 29:10.320
When you answer the phone.

29:10.387 --> 29:12.589
How you always seem to be
wearing white.

29:12.657 --> 29:16.192
How wine seems to be
a food group for you.

29:16.260 --> 29:18.328
I like that you know
who you are,

29:18.395 --> 29:21.498
and that you fix
everyone around you.

29:21.566 --> 29:25.334
But you seem...
sad to me, Olivia.

29:25.401 --> 29:28.671
I like you,
but you seem sad.

29:28.738 --> 29:30.506
And if you let me,

29:30.574 --> 29:32.875
maybe I can help you
not be so sad.

29:32.943 --> 29:34.209
Because whatever
happened to you...

29:34.277 --> 29:36.612
<i>Whoever</i> happened to you...

29:36.680 --> 29:38.514
already happened, it's done.

29:38.582 --> 29:39.914
So maybe I can help you
start fresh.

29:39.982 --> 29:41.716
Maybe...

29:41.784 --> 29:43.050
I'm your do-over.

29:43.118 --> 29:44.686
(Stifled chuckle)

29:44.753 --> 29:46.821
'Cause you deserve
a do-over.

29:46.889 --> 29:49.123
So close your eyes.

29:52.060 --> 29:55.353
Close... your... eyes.

29:58.399 --> 30:00.968
(Exhales)

30:21.989 --> 30:23.890
Are you still thinking
about him?

30:23.957 --> 30:25.722
(Softly) No.

30:29.288 --> 30:30.828
Good night, Olivia.

30:34.133 --> 30:35.733
Good night, Jake.

30:35.801 --> 30:39.003
(Door opens)

30:39.071 --> 30:41.139
(Door closes)

30:41.207 --> 30:44.874
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

30:44.942 --> 30:47.277
(Rustling)

30:48.980 --> 30:51.115
Really? We eat in here.

30:52.350 --> 30:54.118
Huck, throw it away!

30:54.185 --> 30:56.253
- Shh! He's working on something.
- Come here.

31:00.024 --> 31:01.056
(Abby scoffs)

31:02.892 --> 31:04.360
Really?!

31:04.428 --> 31:05.728
Huck, what are you working on?

31:05.795 --> 31:07.597
Finally got a call back
from my source at Justice.

31:07.664 --> 31:09.165
Turns out Maybelle's
ex-boyfriend's been sitting

31:09.233 --> 31:10.766
in a Thai prison
for the last two months.

31:10.834 --> 31:12.735
Customs caught him trying to poop out
a shampoo bottle full of heroin.

31:12.802 --> 31:14.604
 No one knew he
was there until now?

31:14.671 --> 31:16.304
- Rich parents kept it hush-hush.
- So he's not the kidnapper?

31:16.372 --> 31:17.705
No, she is.

31:23.078 --> 31:24.812
The frayed edge...

31:24.880 --> 31:26.648
If a kidnapper
had cut off the ear,

31:26.715 --> 31:28.383
he would have pressed on
Maybelle's scalp for leverage.

31:28.451 --> 31:29.618
It would have been a clean cut.

31:29.685 --> 31:30.985
But this isn't clean

31:31.053 --> 31:32.620
because she couldn't get
the necessary leverage.

31:32.687 --> 31:34.488
She had to saw through it.

31:34.556 --> 31:36.390
She did this to herself.

31:36.458 --> 31:38.992
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

31:39.060 --> 31:40.528
Maybelle kidnapped herself.

31:56.298 --> 31:57.632
Dulles airport.

31:57.700 --> 31:59.834
(Beeps)

32:02.004 --> 32:04.371
We reversed the deposits
to your father's account

32:04.439 --> 32:06.006
and called the police.

32:06.074 --> 32:07.808
Of course you did.

32:07.875 --> 32:09.143
(Scoffs)

32:09.211 --> 32:10.911
You always find a way
to screw me.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.280
How can...

32:14.682 --> 32:16.991
Do you realize
how worried we were?

32:17.111 --> 32:18.885
How sick we were
when we thought s...

32:20.591 --> 32:22.407
How do you do
that to yourself?

32:22.527 --> 32:24.924
How do you cut yourself?
How do you hurt yourself?

32:24.992 --> 32:26.593
I needed the money.

32:26.660 --> 32:28.528
How could you do this to us?

32:28.596 --> 32:30.396
We love you...

32:30.464 --> 32:32.432
What do you want, mom?

32:32.500 --> 32:36.101
I want you to come home.

32:36.169 --> 32:38.703
I want to make it right.

32:38.771 --> 32:41.573
Whatever we did to make you...

32:41.641 --> 32:44.042
Hate us like this...
(Breathes sharply) I...

32:44.110 --> 32:45.810
I... I want to
make it right.

32:45.878 --> 32:50.749
You can't. It's too late.

32:50.816 --> 32:53.317
Poor little rich girl.

32:53.385 --> 32:55.153
Excuse me?

32:55.220 --> 32:56.621
What was it?

32:56.688 --> 32:59.289
He worked late,
she missed your dance recitals,

32:59.357 --> 33:01.291
they threw you
in reform school, rehab,

33:01.359 --> 33:03.460
they tried to buy your love
instead of earning it?

33:03.528 --> 33:05.395
Whatever they told you
in therapy,

33:05.463 --> 33:07.497
whatever sad cliche you're
still holding on to

33:07.565 --> 33:09.432
after all these years,
it doesn't matter.

33:09.500 --> 33:12.269
No one feels sorry for you,
not anymore.

33:12.336 --> 33:15.137
You're being offered
a fresh start,

33:15.205 --> 33:17.839
a clean slate, a do-over.

33:17.907 --> 33:20.609
That doesn't happen.
No one gets that. Ever.

33:20.677 --> 33:21.910
And if you don't take it,

33:21.978 --> 33:24.413
you're not just spoiled
and selfish,

33:24.481 --> 33:26.748
you're stupid.

33:27.551 --> 33:30.485
You need to make
a choice, May.

33:30.553 --> 33:33.488
Because your mom and I...

33:33.556 --> 33:35.423
she can't go through this
again.

33:35.491 --> 33:37.392
So you need to make a choice.

33:37.460 --> 33:39.527
You want the money...

33:41.903 --> 33:43.620
Or you want your family?

33:45.501 --> 33:47.768
You're offering me $20 million?

33:47.836 --> 33:49.436
You take the money,

33:49.504 --> 33:52.406
you don't come back.

33:52.474 --> 33:54.909
What's it gonna be?

33:54.977 --> 33:59.085
Money... or family?

34:04.284 --> 34:06.252
I...

34:06.320 --> 34:10.889
Money... or family?

34:12.592 --> 34:13.760
Money.

34:15.462 --> 34:18.097
I'll wire it to you tomorrow.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.435
Go on.

34:27.641 --> 34:28.540
Get!

34:33.911 --> 34:36.213
(Sobbing)

34:36.281 --> 34:37.614
(Door closes)

34:44.123 --> 34:46.958
(Sobbing continues)

34:47.025 --> 34:48.525
(Door closes)

34:51.594 --> 34:54.297
Hey, dad, it's me.

34:54.364 --> 34:57.300
Lindsay. Again. Uh...

34:57.368 --> 34:58.935
I'm not sure if you've
checked your messages.

34:59.003 --> 35:01.972
I've left you about ten.
I just...

35:02.040 --> 35:03.540
I wanted to say
"Happy Birthday" to you

35:03.607 --> 35:05.408
instead of to a machine.

35:05.476 --> 35:07.376
But you're not picking up.

35:07.443 --> 35:11.914
Okay, well,
Happy Birthday... again.

35:11.982 --> 35:13.649
(Beeps)

35:13.717 --> 35:15.818
(Sighs)

35:18.421 --> 35:20.122
Tell me this isn't happening!

35:20.190 --> 35:21.990
(Door slams) Tell me
those men in my office,

35:22.058 --> 35:24.726
those men in my <i>house...</i>

35:24.794 --> 35:26.961
The ones putting my entire
life into boxes and bags...

35:27.029 --> 35:29.864
It's happening.

35:29.932 --> 35:32.133
I am not the mole, Cy.

35:32.201 --> 35:34.602
I did not leak those documents.

35:34.670 --> 35:37.538
No?

35:37.606 --> 35:40.040
(Softly) No.

35:40.108 --> 35:42.943
(Normal voice) I have spent
my entire adult life

35:43.011 --> 35:45.045
serving this country.

35:45.113 --> 35:46.947
I never went to any
of my son's soccer games.

35:47.015 --> 35:48.648
I missed my daughter's
high school graduation.

35:48.717 --> 35:50.450
I haven't been out to dinner
with my wife in years.

35:50.518 --> 35:53.920
Why? Because I have always
chosen <i>the Agency</i>

35:53.987 --> 35:56.422
above anything else.

35:56.489 --> 35:59.759
Not because it was my job.

35:59.827 --> 36:01.127
Because it was my duty.

36:02.830 --> 36:04.931
I am not your mole.

36:04.998 --> 36:06.699
I am not a traitor!

36:09.002 --> 36:10.668
Tell me that you do not
actually believe

36:10.737 --> 36:12.437
that I betrayed my country.

36:18.277 --> 36:21.146
The president has decided

36:21.214 --> 36:24.916
he no longer needs
your services.

36:24.984 --> 36:27.417
And I serve at the pleasure
of the president.

36:34.692 --> 36:37.128
(Sighs)

36:38.429 --> 36:40.765
(Sighs)

36:43.734 --> 36:45.101
You wanted to see me?

36:45.169 --> 36:46.602
Lauren tells me you asked her

36:46.670 --> 36:48.138
to change my schedule
this weekend.

36:48.205 --> 36:49.839
You had several important
meetings she was going to cancel

36:49.907 --> 36:51.841
because of the children's visit,
and I thought it was simply best

36:51.909 --> 36:53.309
to cancel the children's
visit and...

36:53.377 --> 36:55.245
<i>What</i> is wrong with you?

36:55.312 --> 36:57.413
Fitz, I was just
trying to be helpful.

36:57.481 --> 36:59.481
They're our kids!

36:59.548 --> 37:00.983
You shipped them off
to boarding school

37:01.050 --> 37:02.785
the minute they were
old enough to go,

37:02.852 --> 37:04.286
and now, on one of their
few free weekends,

37:04.353 --> 37:05.821
one of <i>my</i> few free weekends,
you cancel on them?

37:05.889 --> 37:09.224
These are our children!

37:09.292 --> 37:10.759
I get it.

37:10.827 --> 37:12.460
You don't have the mother gene.

37:12.528 --> 37:14.295
You don't want to be
bothered to raise them

37:14.362 --> 37:17.564
or take care of them, but I'd
think you'd at least love them.

37:17.632 --> 37:19.100
I love them.

37:19.168 --> 37:20.734
You're cold.
I'm not cold!

37:20.803 --> 37:22.703
Or maybe you just did it
to hurt me, I don't know.

37:22.771 --> 37:24.172
(Clatters)

37:24.239 --> 37:26.707
I've been looking forward
to this visit, and you just

37:26.775 --> 37:28.442
cancel it without even
asking me?

37:28.510 --> 37:30.010
Are you punishing me?
(Sets bottle down)

37:30.077 --> 37:32.112
I'm not... what about them?
Did you even think about

37:32.180 --> 37:33.680
how this must make
Jerry and Karen feel,

37:33.747 --> 37:35.515
how rejected they must feel
by their own mother

37:35.582 --> 37:37.284
who cancels their visit
at the last minute?

37:37.351 --> 37:39.186
They didn't want to come!

37:39.253 --> 37:40.687
What?

37:40.754 --> 37:43.824
(Sighs)

37:43.891 --> 37:46.826
They didn't want to come, Fitz.

37:46.893 --> 37:48.493
They have called me
every single day

37:48.561 --> 37:50.329
since you summoned them to
the White House for this visit

37:50.396 --> 37:51.964
begging me to cancel this trip.

37:52.032 --> 37:54.033
Oh, please. If you think
I'm gonna buy that...

37:54.100 --> 37:57.569
You are different.
You are <i>different.</i>

37:57.637 --> 37:59.905
Ever since... (Sighs)

38:01.808 --> 38:03.875
You're different.
And they are not babies.

38:03.943 --> 38:05.643
They are not Teddy.
They are teenagers,

38:05.711 --> 38:07.745
and they know their father's
not their father...

38:07.813 --> 38:09.147
I <i>am</i> their father!

38:09.215 --> 38:10.849
You stink like scotch.

38:10.916 --> 38:13.718
They can smell it
on your skin all of the time.

38:13.785 --> 38:16.154
You are lubricated
all of the time now,

38:16.222 --> 38:18.088
which makes you mean.

38:18.156 --> 38:21.024
You're mean, Fitz!

38:21.092 --> 38:22.726
Karen hates tennis,

38:22.793 --> 38:24.561
and you know that!

38:24.628 --> 38:26.596
You used to make it fun
and funny for her.

38:26.664 --> 38:28.332
The last time they were here,
you yelled at her

38:28.399 --> 38:30.067
the entire time she played.

38:30.134 --> 38:31.869
And when you weren't
forcing her to play tennis,

38:31.936 --> 38:33.837
you were firing
political questions at her.

38:33.904 --> 38:36.572
And Jerry...

38:36.639 --> 38:39.876
He is shy and he is gentle,
and you know that,

38:39.943 --> 38:42.511
and now... (Sighs)

38:42.579 --> 38:45.014
He's afraid of you.

38:45.082 --> 38:47.183
It's you.

38:47.251 --> 38:49.018
You're different.

38:49.086 --> 38:51.186
And maybe I'm cold,

38:51.254 --> 38:53.221
and maybe I don't have
the mother gene,

38:53.289 --> 38:55.290
and maybe a thousand other
things that make me

38:55.358 --> 38:56.892
such a horrible villainous
bitch in your book,

38:56.959 --> 38:59.694
but in Jerry and Karen's book,

38:59.762 --> 39:02.297
I'm still their mom.

39:02.365 --> 39:04.266
I haven't changed.
It's you.

39:04.333 --> 39:06.867
You're not their father
anymore.

39:06.935 --> 39:08.435
And it's not because
you found out about Defiance.

39:08.503 --> 39:12.239
That's the thing
that is so... (Sighs)

39:12.307 --> 39:14.708
It's because you found
your precious Olivia

39:14.776 --> 39:16.243
doesn't have the secrets
of the universe

39:16.311 --> 39:17.945
tucked between
her magical thighs,

39:18.013 --> 39:20.747
that she is just a person
like everybody else,

39:20.815 --> 39:23.016
and that she is capable
of using you

39:23.083 --> 39:24.717
just like everybody else.

39:24.785 --> 39:27.053
And suddenly you're devastated

39:27.121 --> 39:31.791
and you stop being
their father.

39:31.858 --> 39:33.559
You're not their father
anymore.

39:33.627 --> 39:35.094
And you are not Fitz anymore.

39:35.162 --> 39:37.663
You know who you are?
You know who you've become?

39:37.731 --> 39:41.734
You're big Jerry.

39:41.802 --> 39:43.569
You're <i>your</i> father.

39:45.505 --> 39:47.139
Everybody
in this White House...

39:47.206 --> 39:49.575
Cyrus and me included...
tiptoe around,

39:49.643 --> 39:51.644
trying to figure out
how to get on your good side,

39:51.711 --> 39:53.512
but you don't have a good side!

39:53.580 --> 39:56.113
You've turned into your father!

39:56.181 --> 39:59.617
So... you should understand

39:59.685 --> 40:03.220
how your children feel,

40:03.288 --> 40:07.124
considering how much
you hated your dad.

40:08.527 --> 40:10.161
They didn't want to come.

40:10.228 --> 40:13.029
And so I told them
they didn't have to.

40:13.097 --> 40:15.365
Deal with it.

40:15.433 --> 40:16.800
(Scoffs)

40:16.868 --> 40:20.370
Put another glass of scotch
on top of it and just...

40:20.438 --> 40:22.405
deal with it.

40:26.543 --> 40:28.845
(Door opens)

40:28.912 --> 40:30.480
(Door closes)

40:40.557 --> 40:44.192
(Turns off engine)
This is it.

40:44.259 --> 40:46.361
This is it?
Where's the mom?

40:46.428 --> 40:49.330
Dad's name is Dave.
Daughter's Emily.

40:49.398 --> 40:51.633
Mother died a few years ago.

40:51.701 --> 40:53.201
Cancer.

40:53.268 --> 40:56.170
Uh, since then, Dave's
been running half-marathons.

40:56.238 --> 40:59.473
Emily loves to paint.
Watercolors, mostly.

40:59.541 --> 41:01.642
They're doing a lot better now.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.677
This isn't what you wanted
at all.

41:04.461 --> 41:06.294
No. No, they're not for me.

41:13.087 --> 41:14.388
(Exhales)

41:16.857 --> 41:19.759
(Breathes deeply)

41:22.362 --> 41:24.196
(Plate clatters, rustling)

41:31.638 --> 41:33.138
Hey, turn that up.

41:33.205 --> 41:34.806
<i>The "Times" is reporting</i>

41:34.874 --> 41:36.975
<i>that C.I.A. Director</i>
<i>Grayden Osborne...</i>

41:37.043 --> 41:38.677
(Abby and Harrison) Olivia! <i>Was
found dead earlier this evening,</i>

41:38.745 --> 41:41.046
<i>the victim</i>
<i>of an apparent suicide.</i>

41:41.113 --> 41:43.448
<i>A body found inside a vehicle</i>
<i>in rock creek park</i>

41:43.516 --> 41:47.184
<i>has allegedly been identified</i>
<i>as that of Osborne.</i>

41:47.252 --> 41:49.820
<i>The Central Intelligence Agency</i>
<i>has yet to make a statement.</i>

41:49.888 --> 41:51.255
(Sirens wailing,
police radio chatter)

41:51.322 --> 41:54.992
(Camera shutter clicking)

41:57.696 --> 41:59.063
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking)

42:06.171 --> 42:07.604
- Hi. You mind?
- Yeah.

42:09.907 --> 42:11.508
(Sighs and rubs hands)

42:11.576 --> 42:13.210
Chilly tonight, huh?

42:13.278 --> 42:14.344
Supposed to drop
even more tomorrow.

42:14.412 --> 42:16.346
Hmm.

42:16.414 --> 42:18.715
So it's done?

42:18.783 --> 42:20.450
It's done.

42:20.517 --> 42:22.685
And the police believe
it's a suicide?

42:22.752 --> 42:25.488
Hook, line, and sinker.

42:25.556 --> 42:28.958
I have to say,
it was staged perfectly.

42:29.025 --> 42:31.127
And now everyone thinks
that Osborne is the mole.

42:31.195 --> 42:32.895
- Hmm.
- Or was.

42:34.764 --> 42:37.532
Well... you stay warm now.

42:37.600 --> 42:38.733
Yeah, you, too.
