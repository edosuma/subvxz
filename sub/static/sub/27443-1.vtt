00:01.669 --> 00:04.803
- A lot has happened
in the last few months.

00:04.839 --> 00:07.573
I had my heart set on
going to law school.

00:07.608 --> 00:08.574
- Welcome to Pepperdine.

00:08.609 --> 00:09.808
- Thank you.

00:09.844 --> 00:11.110
But in the end, it
wasn't meant to be.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.779
Kerry's career hasn't
exactly taken off

00:13.814 --> 00:15.047

00:15.082 --> 00:16.615
I mean, he's trying.

- Give me a call.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.051
Work something out.

00:19.086 --> 00:22.121
- But the way things are, we
can't really afford law school.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.722
- I've got one more resolution.

00:23.758 --> 00:26.658
- Bryant and Alisa hooked
up on New Year's Eve.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.794
Even though Bryant's
been on tour a lot,

00:28.829 --> 00:30.829
things seem to be
working out for now.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.231
- I just wanted to
apologize to you.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.633
- Alexandra and I ironed
out our differences.

00:34.668 --> 00:35.601
We need to hang out.

Let's go!

00:36.871 --> 00:37.903
Let's do it!

00:39.607 --> 00:41.273
And I think I really need
that in my life right now.

00:41.308 --> 00:44.777
- You are the new
Miss Tennessee USA.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.745
- Now that she's
actually Miss Tennessee,

00:46.781 --> 00:50.149
she's completely obsessed
with becoming Miss USA.

00:50.184 --> 00:53.852
But unfortunately, her cousin
and go-to trainer, Jackson,

00:53.888 --> 00:55.687
is a little distracted.

00:55.723 --> 00:58.123
After Jackson totally
blew it with Jessica--

00:58.159 --> 01:00.859
- Are you saying we
can't be friends anymore?

01:00.895 --> 01:01.860
- Yeah.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.028
- It's your music career.

01:03.064 --> 01:05.030
It's your love life.

01:05.066 --> 01:08.033

Savannah came to an explosive

01:08.069 --> 01:08.967
end--

01:10.304 --> 01:11.236
- Are y'all in a fight.

01:13.374 --> 01:16.208
- --Jackson has fallen
for a new girl, Baylee.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.643
- I love you.

01:17.678 --> 01:18.977
- I love you so much.

01:19.013 --> 01:21.814
- And they are spending
a lot of time together.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.283
And Jessica, she
recently surprised us

01:24.318 --> 01:26.051
with some huge news.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.887
After things fizzled out
between her and Jackson,

01:28.923 --> 01:30.889
she met someone new.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.291
His name is Dre.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.359
And after dating for
only seven months--

01:34.395 --> 01:35.360
- I'm engaged!

01:35.396 --> 01:37.963
- She's engaged!

01:37.998 --> 01:40.599

what she always wanted.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.737
Yep, she's rushing
into a marriage

01:45.773 --> 01:48.140
with a guy she met
seven months ago.

01:48.175 --> 01:52.144
After waiting 30 years,
we all hope she's right.

01:52.179 --> 01:55.013
But I guess everyone's
taking chances.

01:55.049 --> 01:59.384
Alisa is breaking her
no-musicians rule for Bryant.

01:59.420 --> 02:02.754
Alexandra is counting
on love-struck Jackson

02:02.790 --> 02:04.923
to help her win Miss USA.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.826
But Baylee may be
stealing her spotlight.

02:07.862 --> 02:10.762
And Kerry and I need to
answer the most burning

02:10.798 --> 02:11.864
question of all.

02:11.899 --> 02:15.100

beat of my own drum. â™ª

02:15.136 --> 02:16.668

02:31.252 --> 02:32.117
what is this
supposed to work out?

02:32.153 --> 02:32.918
- Your hamstrings.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.119
- Oh.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.721
- Does that give
you a bigger butt?

02:35.756 --> 02:36.121
- No.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.790
- Oh.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.359

02:40.394 --> 02:42.794

throwing the engagement party.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.129
That was super fun.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.797

you're getting married.

Guess what!

02:53.240 --> 02:54.106
I found him!

02:54.141 --> 02:55.440
We're getting married!

02:55.476 --> 02:57.209
And you've only known
him for seven months.

02:57.244 --> 02:59.211
- I would have married him five
months ago if I could have.

02:59.246 --> 03:00.112
But--

03:00.147 --> 03:00.746
- You're not nervous?

03:00.781 --> 03:01.313

03:01.348 --> 03:03.081
I'm so excited.

mean, a little bit.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.418

03:06.453 --> 03:07.219

going to hurt.

03:07.254 --> 03:08.420
- Seriously?

03:08.455 --> 03:09.888
God created humans to have sex.

03:09.924 --> 03:10.923

03:10.958 --> 03:12.057
Yeah, it's like taking a shit.

03:12.092 --> 03:12.758
You just do it.

03:12.793 --> 03:13.425
- Wow.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.726

03:14.762 --> 03:15.460

03:15.496 --> 03:16.995
It's a little different.

I just feel like Dre
is a man, and he's

03:28.142 --> 03:29.841
ready for a serious
relationship.

03:29.877 --> 03:30.909
- He knows what he wants.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.177
- Knows exactly what he wants.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.445
- That is important.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.247
- Bryant seems like
that kind of guy.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.849
Would y'all ever get married?

03:37.885 --> 03:40.085
- I mean, not in three months.

03:40.120 --> 03:40.919
But--

03:40.955 --> 03:41.853
- Shut up!

Dre is a doctor.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.294
You have hit the jackpot.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.829
- I'm not going to lie.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.031
I'm kind of jealous of
being married to someone

03:53.067 --> 03:54.866

going to be cheap or free.

04:12.319 --> 04:17.189

kind of what you have to do.

her at dinner tonight.

a good foundation.

say that about her.

talk about that at home.

our first conversation.

I have a few radio, promotional
things, great exposure.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.588
And so I think that's
our first step.

09:16.623 --> 09:20.091
I think we should start
working together immediately.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.115
- How can I consider
her a business partner?

09:44.151 --> 09:46.151
She's two years younger than me.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.053
Her job is, what, Instagram?

09:48.088 --> 09:50.555
OK, so she's younger than
me and she does Instagram.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.223
Good job.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.859
- I'm expressing to you
that that's not appropriate.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.394
- Why are you so defensive?

09:56.430 --> 09:57.629
Why can't this just be
a conversation about--

that it's [bleep] up that you

me, yeah, I'm in.

it's not good for your family.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.591
- It is good for my family.

10:26.627 --> 10:29.694
My family's been helping me
pursue this, sacrificing a lot,

10:29.730 --> 10:31.529

should possibly do

10:33.634 --> 10:36.334

hurts the effort.

about it before you said yes.

went and hired this girl.

sorry I didn't ask you

10:44.711 --> 10:45.610

10:45.646 --> 10:46.578

two pageants in my life.

third one is Miss USA.

17:34.921 --> 17:35.653
- I'm not!

17:35.688 --> 17:36.788
- Don't cheat!

17:36.823 --> 17:37.155
- Huh!

17:37.190 --> 17:38.056
Now

17:38.091 --> 17:39.057
- Oh, you get the wish!

17:39.092 --> 17:40.825
OK, now, you got to blow it.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.161
- Um--

17:43.196 --> 17:44.729
- Good.

17:44.764 --> 17:45.830
- It was a good wish, babe.

17:45.865 --> 17:46.664
- What was your wish?

17:49.736 --> 17:52.070
- I am really excited
to marry you, babe.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.372
Are you nervous at all?

17:54.407 --> 17:56.307
- Not really.

17:56.342 --> 17:58.643
- At all?

17:58.678 --> 18:01.379
- Just to be, I guess,
beginning of being married.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.315
I feel like a lot of people
say marriage is tough.

18:04.350 --> 18:08.319
But what's the thing that's
like stressing you out most?

18:08.354 --> 18:10.721
- I mean--

18:10.757 --> 18:12.323
I mean, it's hard to
have a relationship,

18:12.358 --> 18:14.659
and be a serious musician.

18:14.694 --> 18:18.329
Because your time
is so unpredictable.

18:18.364 --> 18:21.265
At least that's I kind
of get from Rachyl.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.067
- What's going on there?

18:23.103 --> 18:24.702
I know I'm just--

18:24.737 --> 18:27.772
- Kerry's just very dedicated
to his music career.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.240
And so he tours a lot.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.175
So she just kind of feels
like a single parent

18:31.211 --> 18:32.343
whenever he's gone.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.177
And--

18:33.213 --> 18:35.246
- That'd be hard.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.915
That's not going to
be that way for us.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.117
Right?

18:39.152 --> 18:40.184
- I don't want it to be.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.086
But I don't know.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.388
- It sounds like it's
communication issues.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.389
So--

18:47.494 --> 18:54.031
- So one thing we haven't
talked about, how--

18:54.067 --> 18:55.933
I've been meaning to
ask you, how are you

18:55.969 --> 18:58.469
feeling about that night?

18:58.505 --> 18:59.237
- That--

18:59.272 --> 19:00.104
- Like, our--

19:00.140 --> 19:01.739
- The wedding night.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.041
-<i> The</i> night.

19:04.077 --> 19:05.877
- I'm glad you asked.

19:05.912 --> 19:06.878
- OK.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.146
Well, me too.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.947
- It's going to be a
first for both of us.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.719
And, I don't-- what--

19:14.754 --> 19:16.087
what are you expecting?

19:16.122 --> 19:17.155
Or what are you--

19:17.190 --> 19:18.222
what are you nervous about?

19:18.258 --> 19:19.891
- I'm expecting fireworks.

19:19.926 --> 19:20.291
- Fireworks?

19:20.326 --> 19:21.125
OK.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.126
It's going to be--

19:22.162 --> 19:23.161
- We going to set them off.

19:23.196 --> 19:25.229
- It's going to be dangerous.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.131
- Yeah.

19:27.167 --> 19:30.468
No, I think, for me,
what I see that's really

19:30.503 --> 19:34.272
cool is just being able to do
something new with you that--

19:34.307 --> 19:35.273
I mean--

19:35.308 --> 19:36.807
- A few things new with me.

19:36.843 --> 19:37.341
- OK.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.776
Yeah, why not?

19:38.811 --> 19:40.111
OK.

19:40.146 --> 19:41.279
- We probably shouldn't
be talking about this.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.246
We're not married yet.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.181
- That's true.

19:43.216 --> 19:44.815
That's true.

19:44.851 --> 19:45.516
- You don't need to be
thinking about these things.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.150
- Can't wait.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.418
- Stop.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.953
I know what you're
thinking right now.

19:48.988 --> 19:49.420
Stop it.

19:49.455 --> 19:50.087
- Stop.

19:50.123 --> 19:50.855
Just stop.

19:50.890 --> 19:51.856
- Cut it out.

19:51.891 --> 19:52.924
- It's going to be the best.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.025
It's going to be worth the wait.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.326
[music playing]

20:04.170 --> 20:06.470
- (SINGING) Help me.

20:06.506 --> 20:10.341
It's like the walls
are caving in.

20:10.376 --> 20:13.544
Sometimes I feel like giving up.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.947
But I just can't.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.015
It isn't in my veins.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.785
Lying on the bathroom
floor, feeling nothing.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.853
Overwhelmed and
insecure, give me

20:22.889 --> 20:26.123
something I can take to
ease my mind, slowly.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.862
Have a drink and
you'll feel better.

20:31.898 --> 20:35.066
Just take her home,
and you'll feel better.

20:35.101 --> 20:38.402
Keep telling me
that it gets better.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.870
Does it ever.

20:43.176 --> 20:45.076
Help me.

20:45.111 --> 20:48.813
It's like the walls
are caving in.

20:48.848 --> 20:52.416
Sometimes, I feel
like giving up.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.319
No medicine is strong enough.

20:55.355 --> 20:58.823
Help me.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.525
I'm crawling in my skin.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.362
Sometimes feel like giving up.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.597
But I just can't.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.299
It isn't in my blood.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.972
It isn't in my in my blood.

21:21.281 --> 21:24.515
- I like the curls.

21:24.550 --> 21:27.218
It's been a long time.

21:31.524 --> 21:32.456
(MUS

21:32.492 --> 21:33.691
(SINGING) For the thrill of it.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.164
For the thrill of it.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.432
- This is cute.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.034
- Yeah, they got all the good
stuff, look.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.402
- Those are like
two sets of panties.

21:44.437 --> 21:44.902
- No, it's one.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.070
[laughter]

21:46.105 --> 21:47.004
There's just a
hole in the middle

21:47.040 --> 21:48.005
for the important things.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.473
- OK, y'all. This is a lot.

21:49.509 --> 21:50.041
- Look at.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.142
It's a harness.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.910
- Like, what are you harnessing?

21:52.945 --> 21:55.680
- I want to be a fly on the wall
when you try and put this on.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.815
- I would be in the
bathroom for four hours,

21:57.850 --> 21:59.917
and I think I would come
out, and he would be like--

21:59.952 --> 22:01.085
- He'd be asleep.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.520
- --so confused.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.555
There's panties in
this little box.

22:04.590 --> 22:05.523
- Perfect.

22:05.558 --> 22:06.057
- They're probably edible.

22:08.561 --> 22:11.729
- Are you [bleep] kidding me?

22:11.764 --> 22:13.164
- What's that?

22:13.199 --> 22:15.599
- I can't believe Bryant
took Sammy on tour with him.

22:15.635 --> 22:16.734
- Wait, who?

22:16.769 --> 22:19.003
- His little
photographer, Sammy.

22:19.038 --> 22:22.506
Still trying to weasel
her way into his world.

22:22.542 --> 22:23.841
- No.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.076
- I don't have anything
nice to say about her--

22:25.111 --> 22:26.610
- [laughter]

22:26.646 --> 22:28.045
- --because I feel like
she's a wounded animal,

22:28.081 --> 22:30.781
like Bryant turned her down,
and then he got with me.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.583
- What is it these
girls traveling around

22:32.618 --> 22:33.784
with boys that--

22:33.820 --> 22:35.786
- [bleep] snakes,
that's what it is.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.922
I was looking forward to
seeing Bryant when he comes

22:37.957 --> 22:39.123
through Nashville tomorrow.

22:39.158 --> 22:41.025
Now, I'm just pissed off.

22:41.060 --> 22:44.929
But that's something I'll have
to bring up when I talk to him.

22:44.964 --> 22:49.533
You were talking to Jeremiah
for quite a while at Ole Red.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.035
- Jeremiah Carter.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.636
- Was it awkward?

22:52.672 --> 22:53.270
- No.

22:53.306 --> 22:54.939
It wasn't awkward.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.040
It was just-- I was really
excited, like oh, my god,

22:56.075 --> 22:56.907
you're back.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.075
We should hang out.

22:58.111 --> 23:00.811
He asked me to meet
him for dinner.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.047
- Like that you,
Kerry, and Jeremiah.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.116
- I mean, Kerry wasn't there.

23:05.151 --> 23:08.219
- Wait, you had dinner with him?

23:08.254 --> 23:08.919
- Why?

23:08.955 --> 23:10.554
- Why?

23:10.590 --> 23:11.589
- He was like my best friend
for two years, you guys.

23:11.624 --> 23:12.890
He was there when Wolf was born.

23:12.925 --> 23:15.493
- Ah, are you going to
tell Kerry you saw him?

23:15.528 --> 23:16.794
- Probably not.

23:16.829 --> 23:19.830
- You don't think you're
playing with fire?

23:19.866 --> 23:21.565
- You're definitely
playing with fire.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.667
[music playing]

23:23.703 --> 23:27.805
(SINGING) [vocalizing] We got
to start right now.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.707
It starts right now.

23:32.311 --> 23:33.310
Hey.

23:33.346 --> 23:35.146
- Oh, my gosh.

23:35.181 --> 23:35.846
It's happening.

23:35.882 --> 23:36.847
- Yay.

23:36.883 --> 23:37.815
- Woo.

23:37.850 --> 23:38.816
- I'm going to Miss USA!

23:38.851 --> 23:41.919
So I was thinking like
this casual black-white.

23:41.954 --> 23:42.820
- Yeah, of course.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.188
You have to bring that.

23:44.223 --> 23:46.824
- It kind of says like,
I'm here, but I'm fierce.

23:46.859 --> 23:47.958
- You're too much.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.627
- This is going
in a garment bag.

23:49.662 --> 23:50.761
- Girl, yaas.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.329
- Then the second
one is this one.

23:52.365 --> 23:53.631
It's off-the-shoulder.

23:53.666 --> 23:54.865
It's just like, hello.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.033
I'm here.

23:56.068 --> 23:56.867
I'm alive.

23:56.903 --> 23:57.668
I'm at breakfast.

23:57.703 --> 23:58.169
And here I am.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.036
- Perfect.

23:59.071 --> 23:59.703
- Throw it in, right?

23:59.739 --> 24:00.137
- Yeah.

24:00.173 --> 24:00.838
Put it.

24:00.873 --> 24:01.872
Of course.

24:01.908 --> 24:02.673
- Do you recognize this thing?

24:02.708 --> 24:03.707
- So sexy.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.209
It just does everything for you.

24:05.244 --> 24:06.043
- Right.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.311
- It elongates you.

24:07.346 --> 24:08.879
You look tall, and
skinny, and pretty.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.548
Yes, ma'am.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.650
- It's so good to have another
pageant girl's opinion.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.618
- How many suitcases
are you taking?

24:14.654 --> 24:16.020
- Like, only three.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.823
Also, you want to see
my Miss USA dress?

24:18.858 --> 24:19.957
- I can't wait.

24:19.992 --> 24:20.891
Oh, my gosh.

24:20.927 --> 24:21.792
I'm freaking out.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.194
- I'm freaking out, too.

24:23.229 --> 24:24.228
- Wait, who ended up
making your Miss USA dress?

24:24.263 --> 24:25.663
- Giovanni.

24:25.698 --> 24:26.630
- Of course.

24:26.666 --> 24:27.131
It's going to be a dream.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.165
- Custom.

24:28.201 --> 24:29.600
If I gain a pound, I'm [bleep].

24:35.074 --> 24:35.840
- Steve-o.

24:35.875 --> 24:36.874
- Hello.

24:36.909 --> 24:40.010
Let's get the jacket on first.

24:40.046 --> 24:40.644
All right.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.179
Hop up.

24:42.215 --> 24:43.581
How's it feel?

24:43.616 --> 24:45.683
- I mean, the jacket
makes everything.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.084
- So what's the suit for?

24:47.119 --> 24:50.221
- I'm getting this for Ali's
pageant-- for Miss USA.

24:50.256 --> 24:51.655
- Are you bringing Bailey?

24:51.691 --> 24:52.890
- Yes.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.925
I'm absolutely in
love with this girl.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.660
I want you to meet her.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.162
You've known all my girlfriends
since I was 10 years old.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.231
She's, like, such a
breath of fresh air.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.866
- Well, let's see
if she's different.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.067
- What do you think?

25:03.102 --> 25:04.068
- I think it looks good.

25:04.103 --> 25:04.735
- Yeah?

25:04.770 --> 25:05.703
- Yeah.

25:05.738 --> 25:06.270
You have time for a beer?

25:06.305 --> 25:06.904
- I mean, yeah.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.405
Always.

25:08.441 --> 25:11.275
- So there's like this one
layer, and then there's like--

25:11.310 --> 25:12.076
[gasps]

25:12.111 --> 25:12.877
- --the chiffon.

25:12.912 --> 25:13.777
- Girl.

25:13.813 --> 25:15.746
It's absolutely stunning.

25:15.781 --> 25:16.380
- I know.

25:16.415 --> 25:17.715
I think so, too--

25:17.750 --> 25:19.116
the whole thing.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.284
- This is the most beautiful
dress I've ever seen.

25:20.319 --> 25:21.385
I've got to touch it.
