WEBVTT

00:03.670 --> 00:04.638
-JULES: Teddy.
-Whoa, whoa.

00:04.671 --> 00:06.506
It's just me.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.142
The Sandinistas
have found a way to track

00:08.175 --> 00:09.576
our movements out of Honduras.

00:09.609 --> 00:12.713
So we move it south. Costa Rica.
We may have some support there.

00:12.747 --> 00:14.815
A former operative,
he has an airstrip.

00:14.849 --> 00:17.151
-Off the grid.
-You're okay?

00:17.184 --> 00:18.652
Doing this with me?

00:18.685 --> 00:21.088
This isn't about us.

00:21.121 --> 00:23.657
I think Teddy's gonna reroute
the coke through Lucia's farm.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.926
I'm finally gonna get
those fuckers.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.671
I don't know what to do
with my money.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.206
The best kind of problems.

00:39.239 --> 00:41.041
Let me talk
to some of my contacts,

00:41.075 --> 00:42.943
see what I can do.

00:42.977 --> 00:45.612
-Sure you're okay, Avi?
-The longer you live,

00:45.645 --> 00:47.547
the more mistakes you make.

00:47.581 --> 00:50.584
I'm-a get you two birds,
untouched.

00:50.617 --> 00:52.920
You gonna cook it yourself,
rock it yourself,

00:52.953 --> 00:54.254
cut it yourself.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.356
From here on out, the goal

00:56.390 --> 01:00.060
is to only deal with
a few high-level customers.

01:00.094 --> 01:02.262
So start thinking about
who you want to bring in.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.631
All right, y'all.

01:06.967 --> 01:09.403
*

01:09.436 --> 01:10.871
FRANKLIN:
These are the territories

01:10.905 --> 01:12.239
of the people we can trust.

01:12.272 --> 01:13.908
LEON:
What we need all them for?

01:13.941 --> 01:16.777
FRANKLIN:
To put us in touch with
the people moving drugs now.

01:16.811 --> 01:18.278
There's a woman
in San Bernardino

01:18.312 --> 01:20.047
named Bernadette Burns.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.883
Sells every pill under the sun,
got a cop in every pocket.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.952
Then there's, uh, what, Spitter?

01:24.985 --> 01:26.720
Over there in Hawthorne.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.122
He used to sell that H, but...

01:28.155 --> 01:29.924
he might be willing
to switch it up.

01:29.957 --> 01:32.159
Well, how we gonna control
the flow that far from here?

01:32.192 --> 01:34.161
(chuckles)
That's the beauty of it, Lee.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.265
We don't have to.

01:38.298 --> 01:41.435
They buy the coke,
they cook the rock they sell,

01:41.468 --> 01:43.403
-so all we got to do
is deliver and collect.
-LEON: All right,

01:43.437 --> 01:44.805
and what happens when
one of them motherfuckers

01:44.839 --> 01:46.974
-try to cut into our territory?
-Then, my brother,

01:47.007 --> 01:48.675
you do what you do. Huh?

01:48.708 --> 01:50.144
-(Leon chuckles)
-Hey, we done here?

01:50.177 --> 01:52.579
You buying speakers?
This is a goddamn

01:52.612 --> 01:54.181
place of business,
ain't no goddamn clubhouse.

01:54.214 --> 01:55.715
RENNY (quietly):
White boy out front.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.586
All right, y'all,
we gonna take a break.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.655
(indistinct chatter)

02:08.328 --> 02:10.831
Look at this place.

02:10.865 --> 02:13.467
Jamming Jeromes.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.169
Who knew you were all

02:15.202 --> 02:17.271
-so enterprising?
-(chuckles)

02:17.304 --> 02:18.772
'Sup, Avi?

02:18.805 --> 02:20.174
Trying to upgrade your system?

02:20.207 --> 02:21.976
I might.

02:22.009 --> 02:25.579
But right now,
we need to go to the bank.

02:28.983 --> 02:31.218
It's after 3:00, man.
Bank's closed.

02:31.251 --> 02:35.055
For big-time entrepreneurs
of international commerce,

02:35.089 --> 02:37.291
banks are never closed.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.527
At least not where we're going.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.400
This is what you wanted, yes?

02:46.433 --> 02:48.368
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah?

02:48.402 --> 02:51.471
-Then let's go.
-Right now?

02:51.505 --> 02:54.041
I've made appointments,
Franklin.

02:54.074 --> 02:55.809
These people need to trust you.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.411
Yeah, well, I ain't got
that kind of money

02:57.444 --> 02:58.812
sitting in my pocket.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.048
I need to go get it.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.716
Yeah, yeah.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.919
Of course. We'll take you.

03:04.952 --> 03:08.188
Nah, you and the Hardy Boys'll
stay here.

03:08.222 --> 03:11.058
I'll be back
in about half an hour.

03:11.091 --> 03:15.495
Franklin, this is no
small-time street corner shit.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.698
It's got to be at least
1.5 million for these people.

03:22.469 --> 03:24.471
*

03:45.960 --> 03:47.962
(panting)

03:55.269 --> 03:57.171
(bird screeching)

03:59.239 --> 04:01.275
What? What's the problem?

04:02.309 --> 04:04.278
Just trying to get my bearings.

04:04.311 --> 04:06.546
You know, these maps
are not always reliable,

04:06.580 --> 04:10.817
and the terrain
changes all the time.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.753
You better not get us lost
up here.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.124
Yep, that's not likely,

04:17.157 --> 04:18.825
considering the only direction

04:18.858 --> 04:20.760
we really got
to worry about's up.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.464
JULIA:
That's always been your problem.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.733
TEDDY:
What?

04:26.766 --> 04:28.168
Paying so much attention
to detail

04:28.202 --> 04:32.106
that you miss
the larger picture.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.341
Larger picture's
not gonna mean shit

04:34.374 --> 04:36.276
if we're walking into trouble.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.312
(wood creaking)

04:46.053 --> 04:49.023
Kim gave the go-ahead
to our man in San Jose.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.157
Oh, great.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.591
Is your contact working
with the CIA?

04:51.625 --> 04:52.692
You trust him?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.299
(creaking continues)

05:05.339 --> 05:07.307
("Maldito Cabaret"
by Los Pamperos playing)

05:38.272 --> 05:40.240
(laughs)

06:16.743 --> 06:18.412

07:47.501 --> 07:49.336
AVI:
Champagne, Captain?

07:49.369 --> 07:51.371
No, thank you. We are soldiers,

07:51.405 --> 07:54.073
not rock and roll stars
or gunrunners.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.044
Okay.

08:03.082 --> 08:05.719
AVI:
Here's to you...

08:06.753 --> 08:08.522
...for breaking your cherry

08:08.555 --> 08:11.124
in international banking.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.293
Glad to see you in a better mood
than last time.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.695
Well...

08:15.729 --> 08:17.997
makes me happy, dear Franklin,

08:18.031 --> 08:21.535
to know I was right about you.

08:21.568 --> 08:24.003
Right about what?

08:24.037 --> 08:26.206
That you're a mensch.

08:26.240 --> 08:30.076
And here we are,
on top of the world.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.265
(insects chirping)

08:54.868 --> 08:56.470

They won't bite.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.084
Hey, y'all.

09:11.117 --> 09:14.688
I'm Bobby Kim, but around here,
they call me BobBob.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.123
JULIA:
Hey, BobBob.

09:17.156 --> 09:19.125
I'm Julia.

09:19.158 --> 09:20.527
This is Teddy.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.195
TEDDY:
Hey.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.197
BOBBOB:
You're a little ways from home,
aren't you?

09:24.230 --> 09:26.099
Assuming you being here means
the United States government

09:26.132 --> 09:27.634
needs our airstrip.

09:27.667 --> 09:28.935
What makes you say that?

09:28.968 --> 09:30.069
What else could you want?

09:30.103 --> 09:31.971
We don't have any uranium.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.774
JULIA:
Few hundred miles north of here,

09:34.808 --> 09:36.242
people are fighting
for their freedom.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.745
And if we don't arm them,
they will lose.

09:38.778 --> 09:40.747
BOBBOB:
And only our little tribe
can save them?

09:40.780 --> 09:43.617
You know how important
an access like yours can be.

09:44.918 --> 09:45.885
You.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.121
You're wondering
about these men.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.492
Nota and Anhil killed a man

09:52.526 --> 09:54.494
because Nota wanted
to take his wife.

09:54.528 --> 09:57.897
For this crime,
they'll be burned at sunset.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.199
Do you have a problem with that?

10:01.267 --> 10:03.937
No. No problem.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.840
Good.

10:06.873 --> 10:08.908
So, now you know what we do
with our criminals.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.477
Let's go down to my place,

10:10.510 --> 10:13.112
and we'll see
how you measure up.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.451

10:33.032 --> 10:35.435
I'm over distribution, Boy.

10:35.469 --> 10:36.836
You always work with me.

10:36.870 --> 10:40.106

Hey, Lee.

-Look at this nigga
over here crying

'cause he can't keep his bitch
off a better man's pipe.

Who the fuck
you talking to, nigga?!

11:05.264 --> 11:07.300

Who you fucking talking to?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.168
Grab this nigga, man!

11:09.202 --> 11:11.337
-Fuck you, nigga!
-MANBOY: Nigga, relax!

11:11.371 --> 11:14.374
-Calm the fuck down.

your stupid ass rich,

giving our recipe, nigga?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.414
Probably set up my truck,
nigga?!

11:20.447 --> 11:23.249
Fuck you!
And fuck you, too, bitch!

11:23.282 --> 11:25.218
I miss you, too, Leon.

11:25.251 --> 11:27.554
Hey, we out. Shit.

-Bye, Lee.
-Shut the fuck up!

11:30.123 --> 11:31.925
MAN:
You done messed up, girl.

11:31.958 --> 11:34.728
I told you to stay your ass
in the back when he was here.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.396
Yeah, but you didn't tell me
he was here.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.331
Bitch, I said his fucking name!

11:38.364 --> 11:40.667

Why don't you get cleaned up,

at the bar?

12:40.627 --> 12:42.395
No, my duffel bags don't drink.

-They don't eat, either.

12:45.699 --> 12:47.567
This place got room service?

12:47.601 --> 12:50.003
Are you planning to spend
the whole time in this room?

12:50.036 --> 12:52.572
Not if we go to the bank
before dinner, Avi.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.742
The vice president we need
to see can't make it today.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.512

-Wait. Hold up.

always open for people like us.

Something came up.
He had to go out of town.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.652
Just for the night.

13:05.685 --> 13:09.956
I'll have his secretary
give us an exact time.

you'll be relaxed, huh?

No. Mr. Castallan

AVI:
One thing I've learned over
the many years I've lived:

14:50.957 --> 14:54.227
if you don't enjoy life today,
you never will.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.930
Avi, you know
what I got up here, right?

14:56.963 --> 14:58.598
Your money's safe.

14:58.632 --> 15:00.199
Oh, yeah? How you figure that?

15:00.233 --> 15:02.268
(knocking)

15:02.301 --> 15:04.337
Hold on.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.812
Avi sent me to guard the room
so you can go downstairs.

15:12.846 --> 15:14.948
What's in the box?

15:19.619 --> 15:21.254
Your money will be safe.

15:22.656 --> 15:24.157
(man screaming in distance)

15:24.190 --> 15:26.092
Raw pigs' brain is a delicacy
only eaten

15:26.125 --> 15:27.827
fresh out of the skull
on celebratory

15:27.861 --> 15:30.964
and somber occasions.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.734
Interesting.
(clears throat)

15:34.768 --> 15:38.204
(screaming continues)

15:41.007 --> 15:43.576
I heard some of the people
call you "Dima"?

15:43.609 --> 15:45.578
You're good with language.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.816
-(screaming continues)
-Yes, Dima. It means crocodile.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.985
Why do they call you that?

15:52.018 --> 15:54.854
(loud screaming)

16:04.163 --> 16:05.865
(clears throat)

16:08.034 --> 16:10.837
My job in your language
is procurer.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.339
The name "Dima" means...

16:13.372 --> 16:15.875
that I get what I hunt for.

16:15.909 --> 16:18.011
-And what is it that you hunt?
-Medicine.

16:18.044 --> 16:21.180
Clothes. Things
that make our lives easier.

16:22.716 --> 16:25.018
Using our plane
and refueling stations,

16:25.051 --> 16:26.519
we travel the Caribbean

16:26.552 --> 16:28.454
getting what we need
by moving contraband.

16:28.487 --> 16:31.624
The CIA has taught me
many skills.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.626
JULIA:
I read your file.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.929
It didn't say why
you left the Agency.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.665
Well, at first, I was a patriot.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.837
And after that,

16:43.870 --> 16:47.006
there was innocent blood
on my hands.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.209
And then, finally, I was alone.

16:50.243 --> 16:54.647
JULIA:
We've also sacrificed everything
to remain faithful to a cause.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.751
And, yes,
we need your landing strip

16:57.784 --> 17:01.921
to provide weapons and supplies
to those who need our help.

17:01.955 --> 17:04.223
For your Contras in Nicaragua.

17:05.591 --> 17:07.226
We'll need
to expand the landing strip

17:07.260 --> 17:08.728
to accommodate larger planes.

17:11.765 --> 17:13.232
You.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.602
Tell me why you fight this war.

17:16.635 --> 17:19.238
To free the people of Nicaragua,

17:19.272 --> 17:22.776
stop the spread of communism.

17:22.809 --> 17:26.112
(laughing)

17:26.145 --> 17:29.082
You really believe you can just
hand a man his freedom,

17:29.115 --> 17:31.117
like a coconut?

17:37.456 --> 17:39.458
(band playing upbeat music)

17:42.295 --> 17:44.297
(men singing in Spanish)

17:58.477 --> 18:01.514
Oh! Franklin!
Come here!

18:06.853 --> 18:08.888
Yeah, I love Franklin.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.090
This is Franklin, pretty ladies.

18:11.124 --> 18:14.393
When I met this guy, well,

18:14.427 --> 18:18.731
he was a kid
trying to make a few dollars.

18:18.764 --> 18:23.002
In less than a year,
he became a millionaire,

18:23.036 --> 18:27.106
running his... gang
like a big business.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.608
Ain't that right, Franklin?

18:29.642 --> 18:33.012
I watched you grow
from a schoolboy

18:33.046 --> 18:35.081
-to big-boss millionaire.
-Excuse me.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.115
Huh?

18:36.149 --> 18:37.550
What happened?

18:48.394 --> 18:49.628
Hello.

18:51.497 --> 18:52.832
You speak English?

18:52.866 --> 18:54.600
I mean, I speak some Spanish.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.502
I understand you.

18:56.535 --> 18:58.872
Cool.

18:58.905 --> 19:02.375
Well, um, I just saw you
and wanted to speak.

19:03.642 --> 19:04.978
I mean, I-I saw you

19:05.011 --> 19:06.545
with the flowers today, right?

19:06.579 --> 19:09.348
Yes. I supply
and arrange flowers

19:09.382 --> 19:11.150
for four hotels in the city.

19:11.184 --> 19:13.519
Wow. They're beautiful.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.188
(both chuckle softly)

19:15.221 --> 19:17.290
So, um,

19:17.323 --> 19:19.658
would you like to join us?

19:22.728 --> 19:24.931
Your friends are not my type.

19:26.365 --> 19:27.901
Oh.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.236
We could get a different table.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.513
(sighs)

19:41.948 --> 19:44.150
Thank you for your hospitality.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.818
It's been a long day.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.520
We could probably use some rest.

19:47.553 --> 19:49.655
So we'll talk some more
in the morning?

19:49.688 --> 19:52.258
I'm afraid
we're just getting started.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.275
What is this?

20:09.308 --> 20:11.177
The tea brings
the inner man out.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.746
But first,
your body purges itself.

20:13.779 --> 20:16.182
The robes are so
you won't soil your clothes.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.884
-We didn't come here
to get high.
-It's part of the ritual.

20:18.918 --> 20:22.956
Every adult present must drink
the tea to honor the dead.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.690
You honor criminals?

20:24.723 --> 20:26.459
We honor life.

20:26.492 --> 20:31.230
And if you want to work with us,
you must share in our rituals.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.266
(insects chirping)

20:57.323 --> 20:59.492
(slurps)

21:05.098 --> 21:06.299
(Julia groans)

21:14.173 --> 21:16.775
(retching)

21:16.809 --> 21:17.776
(spits)

21:17.810 --> 21:19.178
(gagging)

21:19.212 --> 21:21.680
(coughs, spits)

21:24.283 --> 21:26.152
(coughing)

21:29.788 --> 21:31.524
How you doing?

21:32.691 --> 21:33.826
For a while there...

21:33.859 --> 21:35.261
(gags)

21:35.294 --> 21:37.430
(groans, panting)

21:37.463 --> 21:39.932
(exhales) For a while there,
it felt like I was gonna die.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.435
But I think it's getting better.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.103
(gags)

21:44.137 --> 21:45.104
(coughs)

21:45.138 --> 21:47.540
(panting)

21:53.712 --> 21:56.015
(spitting)

21:56.049 --> 21:58.184
(panting)

21:58.217 --> 22:00.286
What about you?

22:00.319 --> 22:02.188
(groaning softly)

22:02.221 --> 22:05.024
I'm good now.

22:05.058 --> 22:07.026
Almost good.

22:19.438 --> 22:21.440
*

22:47.433 --> 22:49.135
(grunts)

23:06.119 --> 23:08.887
(yawns)

23:20.099 --> 23:23.602
¿Mariela?

23:23.636 --> 23:25.304
Mariela!

23:29.908 --> 23:32.545
Chingada madre.

23:32.578 --> 23:34.780
(exhales)

23:43.922 --> 23:46.259
(line ringing)

23:46.292 --> 23:48.661
-AVI: What?
-What time we going to the bank?

23:48.694 --> 23:50.496
-Franklin?
-What time?

23:50.529 --> 23:53.999
(mumbles) The secretary
hasn't got back to me yet.

23:54.032 --> 23:57.336
I mean... (clears throat)
we'll go probably today,

23:57.370 --> 23:58.771
maybe tomorrow.

23:58.804 --> 24:00.606
Tomorrow?

24:00.639 --> 24:02.841
This ain't no damn vacation.

24:15.020 --> 24:16.722
Ximena...

24:18.891 --> 24:23.296
I need you to go down
and do something for me.

24:23.329 --> 24:25.364
The fuck you mean
you ain't give Manboy his coke?!

24:25.398 --> 24:27.800
Louie, I just don't do fucking
business with niggas like that!

24:27.833 --> 24:30.035
All right? He lucky
I didn't put a cap in his ass.

24:30.068 --> 24:32.137
Lee, this ain't about you.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.706
This about all of us.

24:33.739 --> 24:36.375
Franklin and me and everybody.

24:36.409 --> 24:38.043
This is motherfucking business,

24:38.076 --> 24:39.978
and you acting like a bitch
with six sore tits!

24:40.012 --> 24:42.915
Oh, I ain't got
to hear that bullshit.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.219
(door opens)

24:47.820 --> 24:49.288
(door closes)

24:49.322 --> 24:51.190
(line ringing)

24:51.224 --> 24:53.859
Peaches, I need you.

24:53.892 --> 24:57.463
*

24:57.496 --> 24:59.498
(birds chirping)

25:04.036 --> 25:05.604
(Teddy groans softly)

25:33.266 --> 25:35.268
*

25:45.110 --> 25:47.946
*

26:08.233 --> 26:10.235
*

26:23.316 --> 26:24.950
(dings)

26:24.983 --> 26:26.752
Gracias.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.260
-No, gracias.
-Mm.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.192
(engine turns off)

27:12.865 --> 27:14.467
MARIELA:
Orale.

27:28.581 --> 27:30.583
*

27:32.084 --> 27:34.252
Ooh-wee, Louie.

27:36.254 --> 27:38.891
Damn, mama, you so fine.

27:38.924 --> 27:40.959
I could eat your ass
with a spoon.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.961
Mm-hmm. (scoffs)

27:42.995 --> 27:45.631
I understand you and Leon
got some kind of problem.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.300
You mean Leon got a problem.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.069
(chuckling)

27:52.337 --> 27:53.872
Leon always ran hot.

27:53.906 --> 27:56.542
Got a Napoleon complex.

27:56.575 --> 27:58.977
But if y'all want to do
serious business,

27:59.011 --> 28:01.547
I suggest you get
your fucking boy in line.

28:01.580 --> 28:04.717
Look like to me
Leon trying to do business

28:04.750 --> 28:07.319
and then he see the woman
that gave you our recipe

28:07.352 --> 28:08.521
and our route.

28:08.554 --> 28:10.589
You lucky he ain't shoot you.

28:10.623 --> 28:13.091
I mean, I can't help it
if Wanda see the benefits

28:13.125 --> 28:16.028
in being with a nigga
like myself.

28:17.062 --> 28:18.030
(chuckles)

28:18.063 --> 28:19.364
Give it to him.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.100
Two birds.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.839
Why the fuck
they call you Manboy?

28:26.872 --> 28:28.674
'Cause I was a full-grown man

28:28.707 --> 28:31.009
when I was still just
a little boy.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.345
Manboy.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.614
Let's go.

28:35.648 --> 28:37.616
(chuckles)

28:41.920 --> 28:44.557
Let's get the fuck up out
of here.

28:46.925 --> 28:48.293
Louie.

28:48.326 --> 28:50.395
Where Leon?

28:50.429 --> 28:52.230
He ain't want to come?

28:52.264 --> 28:55.100
Tell him I say hey.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.936
We should've killed you
when we had the chance.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.938
I don't know
what you blaming me for.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.975
Kevin's the one sold
the recipe to the Mexicans.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.777
(chuckling)

29:04.810 --> 29:06.111
Oh.

29:06.144 --> 29:08.814
They told me about Claudia.

29:10.949 --> 29:11.984
That's just too bad.

29:12.017 --> 29:13.418
Bitch, I'm-a...

29:13.452 --> 29:15.821
-Oh!
-Hey, hey, hey.

29:15.854 --> 29:20.192
(whispering indistinctly)

29:22.194 --> 29:24.129
Wait here.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.835
("Ebony" by Project Soul
playing)

29:35.440 --> 29:37.409
You forget something?

29:37.442 --> 29:38.777
You got to get rid of Wanda.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.445
Get rid of her?

29:42.447 --> 29:45.417
If you want our product,

29:45.450 --> 29:47.920
our business,

29:47.953 --> 29:52.290
you throw that bitch
to the motherfucking curb.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.462
(sucks teeth)

29:57.496 --> 29:59.164
Mm-hmm.

30:01.534 --> 30:03.468
(speaking Hebrew)

30:03.502 --> 30:05.470
-YUDA: Avi.
-(speaking Hebrew)

30:05.504 --> 30:06.905
(speaks Hebrew)

30:09.241 --> 30:10.709
Franklin!

30:10.743 --> 30:12.811
Where have you been?

30:12.845 --> 30:14.580
What are you, my mom?

30:16.649 --> 30:17.716
Where's the money?

30:17.750 --> 30:19.518
Ximena, she had a contact

30:19.552 --> 30:20.986
at the Banco de Panama
Internationale.

30:21.019 --> 30:22.988
Put my money in there.

30:23.021 --> 30:24.122
Good, right?

30:24.156 --> 30:25.858
Why would you do that?

30:25.891 --> 30:28.293
Why wouldn't I do that?
Came here to look for a bank,

30:28.326 --> 30:29.795
didn't I?
Now I got one.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.964
I had plans for you.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.699
I made arrangements.

30:33.732 --> 30:35.634
-Arrangements?
-Yes, arrangements.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.035
(clicks tongue)

30:37.069 --> 30:39.037
Come on, Avi.

30:41.039 --> 30:43.542
You want to admit
what this shit really about?

30:43.576 --> 30:45.210
Huh?

30:53.418 --> 30:57.055
An official in the Israeli
government is blackmailing me,

30:57.089 --> 30:59.257
bleeding me fucking dry.

30:59.291 --> 31:02.194
Because of that,
I can't pay Reed's gunrunners.

31:02.227 --> 31:03.829
-Blackmailing you for what?
-Doesn't matter.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.063
What matters is,

31:05.097 --> 31:07.733
if I can't pay my arms supplier,

31:07.766 --> 31:09.501
Reed's gonna dump me.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.369
My enemies gonna kill me.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.838
So you're gonna steal from me?

31:12.871 --> 31:15.774
I was gonna borrow from you...

31:15.808 --> 31:17.776
just enough to cover the debt

31:17.810 --> 31:19.411
and pay you back with interest

31:19.444 --> 31:21.614
before you even knew
the money was fucking missing.

31:30.923 --> 31:33.458
You know, if my people knew
about this,

31:33.491 --> 31:36.695
I'd have to kill you.

31:36.729 --> 31:39.097
Hell...

31:39.131 --> 31:42.567
if one of my people did this...

31:42.601 --> 31:44.569
I'd kill them.

31:48.841 --> 31:51.744
I'm already dead.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.580
You understand?

31:59.317 --> 32:01.754
What's the bare minimum
you need?

32:06.959 --> 32:08.794
$1.5 million.

32:11.029 --> 32:14.432
I could get by
with maybe a million.

32:14.466 --> 32:16.935
A million.

32:16.969 --> 32:20.806
Okay. At six percent a week.

32:20.839 --> 32:22.507
-What? A week?
-Yeah.

32:22.540 --> 32:24.576
That's the going rate
at the Bank of Saint.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.444
Take it or leave it.

32:28.781 --> 32:31.984
Two weeks is all I need.

32:32.017 --> 32:34.286
(chuckles)

32:34.319 --> 32:36.655
Okay.

32:36.689 --> 32:39.357
Let's go get your money.

32:39.391 --> 32:40.859
Where are you going?

32:40.893 --> 32:42.695
Oh, the money's upstairs.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.262
Yeah.

32:44.296 --> 32:47.833
Those duffel bags are full
of sheets and linen.

32:47.866 --> 32:50.836
I had Ximena take out
a second room.

32:50.869 --> 32:53.005
In it there's a million for you

32:53.038 --> 32:56.408
and another million for you
to help me deposit.

33:00.578 --> 33:02.647
-Huh?
-(laughs)

33:06.551 --> 33:07.986
Come on.

33:16.561 --> 33:20.232
How long have you been
standing there?

33:20.265 --> 33:22.901
I don't carry a watch anymore.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.705
What did you dream?

33:26.739 --> 33:30.208
There was a man...

33:30.242 --> 33:34.546
chained to a sinking boat...

33:34.579 --> 33:37.115
on a shark-infested shore.

33:39.117 --> 33:41.286
Then I threw him the key.

33:43.288 --> 33:46.658
When he reached for it, it
slipped between his fingers...

33:46.691 --> 33:49.027
and fell in the water.

33:53.365 --> 33:56.401
Come, let me show you something.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.041
We will need medical supplies.

34:03.075 --> 34:06.611
25 M16 rifles with ammunition,

34:06.644 --> 34:08.847
a Cessna 441 Conquest II,

34:08.881 --> 34:11.616
and 10,000 American dollars
a month.

34:11.649 --> 34:13.551
Yeah, we can have our
construction crews

34:13.585 --> 34:15.420
on the ground by a week
from today.

34:15.453 --> 34:17.222
They'll only work at night.
And then...

34:17.255 --> 34:19.892
You know, you and Julia
want different things.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.629
Wh-What does that mean?

34:24.662 --> 34:27.299
We, you and I...

34:27.332 --> 34:31.636
we're not in this
for ourselves, Teddy.

34:31.669 --> 34:33.205
We are more than patriotic

34:33.238 --> 34:36.108
because we are willing to die
and even worse,

34:36.141 --> 34:38.911
to suffer and destroy,
for the cause.

34:38.944 --> 34:41.646
In the end...

34:41.679 --> 34:44.917
we expect pain and death.

34:44.950 --> 34:46.952
Betrayal.

34:48.954 --> 34:51.123
Even insanity.

34:51.156 --> 34:54.326
And Julia?

34:54.359 --> 34:56.962
(chuckles softly)

34:56.995 --> 35:00.332
She believes
in a higher calling,

35:00.365 --> 35:03.836
a truth that does not allow
for failure or weakness.

35:03.869 --> 35:07.205
She will never truly
understand men like us.

35:59.257 --> 36:01.259
Just put it in my head.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.696
There's no reason to suffer.

36:13.705 --> 36:16.074
Give me the radio.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.712
The radio.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.863
(footsteps depart)

37:01.419 --> 37:03.421
(truck departs)

37:04.990 --> 37:06.624
(grunts)

37:06.658 --> 37:08.626
Please, please, no.
I'm not fucking...

37:08.660 --> 37:09.928
Yeah, I told her ass
she was cut off

37:09.962 --> 37:11.729
-and had to move out.
-No, no, no, no.

37:11.763 --> 37:12.864
Please. Stop.
I'm not fucking...

37:12.897 --> 37:14.632
-Wanda!
-Please.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.701
-You outta here.
-No, you can't kick me out.

37:16.734 --> 37:18.236
I ain't got nowhere to go.

37:18.270 --> 37:19.471
Please, come on, baby.

37:19.504 --> 37:20.939
I gave you the recipe.

37:20.973 --> 37:22.740
I showed you how Franklin
and them do business.

37:22.774 --> 37:25.443
-And you had a free ride
till now.
-I know.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.612
The motherfuckers don't want you
here, so you got to go.

37:27.645 --> 37:30.048
No, no, no, Manboy, no!

37:30.082 --> 37:31.383
Don't do it!

37:31.416 --> 37:33.385
Stop, no, Manboy!

37:33.418 --> 37:35.887
Stop! No! No.
(grunting)

37:35.920 --> 37:37.255
No...

37:39.524 --> 37:41.726
-No.
-Bitch, you better get

37:41.759 --> 37:43.095
the fuck outta here
before you get hurt.

37:43.128 --> 37:44.963
Fuck you, you little dick nigga.

37:44.997 --> 37:47.132
I know why they really
call you man-boy.

37:47.165 --> 37:49.901
(grunting) Move. Move.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.836
(grunting)

37:51.869 --> 37:53.571
What you talking?

37:53.605 --> 37:55.807
What's all that shit
you talking?

37:55.840 --> 37:57.609
Talk that shit now.

37:57.642 --> 37:59.644
What's all that shit
you was talking, huh?

37:59.677 --> 38:02.280
BOOTSY:
Fuck, there's witnesses, man.
There's witnesses, man.

38:02.314 --> 38:03.982
This rockhead bitch
ain't worth it.

38:04.016 --> 38:05.417
You talkin' that shit, huh?
Talk that shit?

38:05.450 --> 38:07.185
BOOTSY:
Come on, man!

38:07.219 --> 38:08.486
(choking, whimpering)

38:08.520 --> 38:11.323
-(Manboy grunting)
-(gasping)
-Come on!

38:11.356 --> 38:12.957
The fuck off me, nigga!

38:12.991 --> 38:14.993
(Wanda coughing)

38:16.394 --> 38:18.396
(gasping)

38:20.999 --> 38:22.967
(crying)

38:23.001 --> 38:25.303
Good to have you back.

38:25.337 --> 38:27.472
Mm-hmm.

38:27.505 --> 38:29.841
What happened to Avi?

38:29.874 --> 38:33.645
Uh... told him to get
his own ride home.

38:33.678 --> 38:36.548
Huh.
I suppose if you're paying,

38:36.581 --> 38:38.783
you should have it
the way you want.

38:38.816 --> 38:41.086
That's right.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.692
Captain.

38:47.725 --> 38:51.329
Yes, Franklin.

38:51.363 --> 38:55.167
I got the cash for this,
but if it's all right by you...

38:55.200 --> 38:57.535
I'd rather pay by check.

39:14.052 --> 39:16.054

39:36.874 --> 39:38.876

40:10.074 --> 40:12.076
(metal door rattling)

40:26.758 --> 40:29.394
Relax.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.862
Mucho gusto.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.435
I quit the agency
and I joined Reed.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.073
So I'm your contact now.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.108
Get used to it.

This is business.
Let's make some money.

42:42.126 --> 42:46.498
I will bring you all down,
one... by... one.

42:46.598 --> 42:48.266
FRANKLIN: Playin'
a different game now.

42:54.005 --> 42:56.474
-We are not going off on some--
-Wild goose chase.
