01:12.634 --> 01:14.167
<i>This was the planet Mars</i>

01:14.236 --> 01:17.170
<i>as my crew and I first saw it.</i>

01:17.239 --> 01:18.572
<i>Dangerous,</i>

01:18.640 --> 01:20.608
<i>treacherous...</i>

01:20.675 --> 01:23.877
<i>Alive with something we
came to know only as...</i>

01:23.945 --> 01:25.379
<i>Death.</i>

01:25.447 --> 01:27.581
<i>This is what we faced
when our spaceship</i>

01:27.649 --> 01:30.751
<i>cracked up in landing
just six months ago...</i>

01:30.818 --> 01:37.190
<i>In January of this year, 1973.</i>

01:37.259 --> 01:39.526
<i>But it seems as if
six centuries passed</i>

01:39.594 --> 01:42.563
<i>before a rescue ship arrived...</i>

01:42.631 --> 01:45.065
<i>For today, of all my crew,</i>

01:45.133 --> 01:46.833
<i>I, col. Edward carruthers</i>

01:46.901 --> 01:49.470
<i>of the United States
space command,</i>

01:49.537 --> 01:53.641
<i>am the only one alive.</i>

01:53.708 --> 01:57.344
<i>Now, I will be going back to
face my superiors on earth</i>

01:57.412 --> 01:59.880
<i>in Washington.</i>

01:59.947 --> 02:02.182
<i>And perhaps there, too,</i>

02:02.250 --> 02:04.685
<i>I will find another
kind of death.</i>

02:18.917 --> 02:20.884
Ladies and gentlemen
of the press,

02:20.952 --> 02:22.386
as you know, the first attempt

02:22.453 --> 02:24.354
to send a spaceship
to the planet Mars

02:24.422 --> 02:26.623
was made 6 months ago.

02:26.690 --> 02:28.825
We knew that that ship,

02:28.893 --> 02:33.630
the challenge 141,
had reached its destination.

02:33.697 --> 02:35.765
But that's all we knew.

02:35.833 --> 02:39.502
Teleradio communication
with Mars ceased immediately.

02:39.570 --> 02:41.571
And we were forced to assume

02:41.639 --> 02:44.241
that the ship and
crew had been lost.

02:44.309 --> 02:46.576
The man in charge
of this expedition

02:46.644 --> 02:48.678
was a man who had become
known to the world

02:48.746 --> 02:51.548
as the first man
to be shot into space.

02:51.615 --> 02:57.187
The man who pioneered
interplanetary space travel.

02:57.255 --> 03:00.157
Col. Edward carruthers.

03:00.224 --> 03:03.226
2 months ago, we sent
a second ship to Mars

03:03.294 --> 03:07.264
to learn the fate of
col. Carruthers and his crew.

03:07.332 --> 03:09.699
The president has asked me
to pass on to you

03:09.767 --> 03:11.901
this significant news.

03:11.970 --> 03:18.008
Col. Edward carruthers
has been found alive on Mars.

03:18.076 --> 03:21.445
But there is a tragic side
to this history-making event.

03:21.512 --> 03:24.114
Col. Carruthers was
the sole survivor

03:24.182 --> 03:26.749
of this first expedition.

03:26.817 --> 03:30.020
1 hour ago, we received a
teleradio communication

03:30.088 --> 03:31.654
from col. Van heusen,

03:31.722 --> 03:34.524
commander of the
second spaceship.

03:34.592 --> 03:36.360
This ship is now
ready to take off

03:36.427 --> 03:39.696
for its return trip to
the earth from Mars.

03:39.763 --> 03:42.099
And col. Carruthers
is being brought back

03:42.166 --> 03:44.201
for a court-martial

03:44.268 --> 03:51.975
to face trial for the murders
of the rest of the crew.

03:52.043 --> 03:54.677
<i>The rescue ship is
ready to return to earth.</i>

03:54.745 --> 03:58.315
<i>I am to spend the next
4 months with strangers,</i>

03:58.383 --> 04:00.083
<i>a crew of men and women who have</i>

04:00.151 --> 04:02.886
<i>but one single purpose...</i>

04:02.953 --> 04:07.024
<i>To see that I face
a military firing squad.</i>

04:12.563 --> 04:14.497
The emergency air lock
in c compartment

04:14.565 --> 04:17.149
has been left open. What gives?

04:17.218 --> 04:18.651
Sorry, sir, that was me.

04:18.719 --> 04:23.873
I was dumping some empty
crates overboard a while ago.

04:56.790 --> 04:59.326
Name check.

04:59.393 --> 05:02.695
Eric royce, secure.

05:02.763 --> 05:05.132
Mary royce, secure.

05:05.199 --> 05:07.367
Ann Anderson, secure.

05:07.435 --> 05:08.568
Maj. John purdue,

05:08.636 --> 05:11.704
<i>secure.</i>

05:11.772 --> 05:15.008
Bob finelli, secure.

05:15.075 --> 05:16.976
Lt. James calder, secure.

05:23.784 --> 05:26.386
All right! Countdown.

05:26.454 --> 05:29.456
Minus 10, 9,

05:29.524 --> 05:31.424
8, 7,

05:31.492 --> 05:35.395
6, 5, 4,

05:35.463 --> 05:37.830
3, 2,

05:37.898 --> 05:40.167
1!

06:21.626 --> 06:23.360
Carruthers?

06:23.427 --> 06:25.928
Carruthers?

06:25.996 --> 06:27.930
What are you thinking about?

06:27.998 --> 06:30.333
Those 9 bodies
you left down there?

06:30.401 --> 06:32.569
Yes.

06:32.637 --> 06:35.071
But I didn't kill them.

06:35.139 --> 06:39.543
Still sticking to your story
about a mysterious creature.

06:39.610 --> 06:42.579
Do you expect a court-martial
to believe it?

06:42.647 --> 06:44.947
It's all I can tell them.

06:45.015 --> 06:48.117
I wish we could've stayed
and searched for the bodies.

06:48.186 --> 06:49.786
However, there's still
enough evidence

06:49.853 --> 06:52.589
to put you in front
of a firing squad.

06:52.657 --> 06:55.692
You honestly believe I'd
murder 9 of my closest friends

06:55.759 --> 06:58.761
in order to survive on Mars?

06:58.829 --> 07:00.763
Isn't it logical, colonel?

07:00.831 --> 07:03.433
The challenge 141
cracks up in landing.

07:03.501 --> 07:04.967
You know you're
marooned indefinitely

07:05.035 --> 07:07.637
on Mars until
another ship is sent.

07:07.705 --> 07:12.141
If another ship is sent.

07:12.210 --> 07:14.944
You know the food
and supplies aboard

07:15.012 --> 07:19.182
would last the entire
crew only a year,

07:19.250 --> 07:27.250
but they'd last you 10 years,
if the others were dead.

07:27.558 --> 07:30.193
Those people were
killed by something.

07:30.261 --> 07:30.761
Not me.

07:35.099 --> 07:41.971
I want to show you another
something, carruthers.

07:42.039 --> 07:43.406
After you.

07:43.474 --> 07:45.875
At least I appreciate
the freedom of a ship.

07:45.943 --> 07:53.383
Why not? Can you think
of a better prison?

07:53.450 --> 07:55.952
Aren't you afraid I'll murder
you all in your sleep?

07:56.020 --> 07:58.054
Either It. Calder or myself
will be with you

07:58.122 --> 08:00.190
every second of the trip.

08:07.965 --> 08:12.585
Take a look at this.

08:12.653 --> 08:16.490
We brought the dental records
of the first crew from earth.

08:16.557 --> 08:20.793
This is frank kenner.

08:20.861 --> 08:22.429
Kenner?

08:22.497 --> 08:24.331
We found it near
the challenge 141,

08:24.399 --> 08:28.235
the day after we found you.

08:28.302 --> 08:31.638
There's only one kind of
a monster that uses bullets.

08:56.264 --> 08:57.497
The second we hit earth,

08:57.565 --> 08:59.433
I'm gonna jump
through that air lock

08:59.500 --> 09:00.833
all the way to the ground.

09:00.901 --> 09:03.336
Then I'm gonna roll around and
stretch like a cat in the sun.

09:03.404 --> 09:05.305
Oh, boy, the sun.

09:05.373 --> 09:07.541
We'll be 50 million
miles closer to it.

09:07.608 --> 09:10.343
Even when I was a kid, I could
never stand being cold.

09:10.411 --> 09:12.312
How'd you ever win the
ardmore fellowship

09:12.380 --> 09:13.746
in low temperature physics?

09:13.814 --> 09:15.449
I wore long underwear. Ha ha ha.

09:15.516 --> 09:17.650
Aah. That figures.

09:17.718 --> 09:18.952
What do you look forward to?

09:19.019 --> 09:19.786
Girls!

09:19.853 --> 09:21.854
Oh, you!

09:21.922 --> 09:25.192
I think I remember,
a fascinating research.

09:25.259 --> 09:26.759
Won't a geologist do?

09:26.827 --> 09:29.196
You're, uh, military
property, Ann.

09:29.263 --> 09:30.630
Occupied territory.

09:30.698 --> 09:33.032
Every time van
sees you, he floats,

09:33.101 --> 09:34.234
even though the ship is equipped

09:34.302 --> 09:35.502
with artificial gravity.

09:37.338 --> 09:39.072
These days, van seems more
concerned over a manhunt,

09:39.140 --> 09:40.507
than a woman hunt.

09:40.575 --> 09:43.443
It's just that Eric believes
carruthers' story, I don't.

09:43.511 --> 09:46.496
I don't believe it, necessarily.

09:46.563 --> 09:47.730
Nor do I disbelieve it.

09:47.798 --> 09:49.866
However, one thing's sure:
He does believe it.

09:49.933 --> 09:53.169
He had to force himself to
believe it or he'd go insane.

09:53.237 --> 09:56.906
And I didn't do that, did I?

09:56.974 --> 09:58.975
Missed your dinner,
col. Carruthers.

09:59.043 --> 10:01.044
I'm tired of ruining appetites.

10:01.112 --> 10:03.313
I'd just like a coffee,
if I may, miss Anderson.

10:03.381 --> 10:04.881
Of course, colonel.

10:04.948 --> 10:08.284
Better stay here, carruthers.

10:08.352 --> 10:08.985
Jimmy?

10:09.053 --> 10:10.053
Yeah.

10:10.121 --> 10:11.454
Here's some last-minute
computations

10:11.522 --> 10:13.256
on adjusting the orbit.

10:13.324 --> 10:14.657
Look 'em over when
you get a chance.

10:14.725 --> 10:16.426
Yes, sir.

10:23.567 --> 10:25.535
By the time we reach earth,

10:25.602 --> 10:27.370
I'll have his
confession on tape.

10:52.296 --> 10:53.764
Col. Carruthers!

11:02.406 --> 11:06.475
Thank you.

11:06.543 --> 11:12.681
Such a cold, desolate world.
We saw so little of it.

11:12.749 --> 11:15.351
Sometimes I almost
want to believe you.

11:15.419 --> 11:20.023
I killed them or I didn't.
It was me or something.

11:20.090 --> 11:22.292
I've only heard the
story through van.

11:22.359 --> 11:25.094
Now you'd like to
hear my version?

11:25.162 --> 11:27.863
All right.

11:27.932 --> 11:32.969
It's a long story,
but I'll make it brief.

11:33.037 --> 11:35.204
We were all outside the ship,

11:35.272 --> 11:39.375
exploring the Southern tip
of syrtis major,

11:39.443 --> 11:42.178
suddenly a sandstorm came up
and we started back.

11:42.246 --> 11:44.480
I was driving the Jeep.

11:44.548 --> 11:47.951
The sand was so thick
we could barely see.

11:48.018 --> 11:50.853
We were almost back
to the ship when...

11:50.921 --> 11:55.058
Cartwright just disappeared.

11:55.125 --> 11:58.861
One minute he was there and
the next minute he was gone.

11:58.929 --> 12:01.297
As if something had just
plucked him out of the Jeep

12:01.365 --> 12:05.201
like... Candy out of a box.

12:05.269 --> 12:11.174
We heard a weird sort of sound.

12:11.241 --> 12:13.676
Then we thought
we saw a dark shape

12:13.743 --> 12:18.214
running near the Jeep
and started shooting at it.

12:18.282 --> 12:19.748
A few moments later,

12:19.816 --> 12:23.819
kenner and all
the rest were gone.

12:23.887 --> 12:28.358
I was the only one who
made it back to the ship.

12:28.425 --> 12:30.160
When the sandstorm quit, I...

12:30.228 --> 12:32.329
Went out and searched all over.

12:32.396 --> 12:34.030
There wasn't a sign of them.

12:34.098 --> 12:37.700
How can you explain the
bullet hole in the skull?

12:37.768 --> 12:40.503
We were all shooting
at this thing...

12:40.571 --> 12:44.941
Maybe the one who got
the bullet was lucky.

12:45.009 --> 12:47.878
You don't believe me, do you?

12:47.945 --> 12:49.913
I don't disbelieve you.

12:55.285 --> 12:56.785
How about you, lieutenant?

12:56.853 --> 12:59.588
Mars is almost as big as Texas,

12:59.656 --> 13:05.861
maybe it's got monsters.

13:05.929 --> 13:08.597
Carruthers is still talking
about his monsters?

13:08.665 --> 13:10.799
Why don't you stop
baiting him, van?

13:10.867 --> 13:13.202
You're not using your
authority very well.

13:13.270 --> 13:16.105
I'm not doing it for kicks.
Believe me, chicken.

13:16.173 --> 13:17.640
I'm just playing the odds.

13:17.707 --> 13:20.410
Your odds, because
you think he's guilty.

13:20.477 --> 13:21.089
Admitted.

13:26.383 --> 13:28.717
But, Anne, there's a time
factor involved here.

13:28.785 --> 13:30.619
He's unstable right now.

13:30.687 --> 13:32.321
If I crack his story,
I can turn him over

13:32.389 --> 13:35.091
to the court-martial tied
up in a little pink ribbon.

13:35.159 --> 13:37.226
What if he's done
nothing to confess?

13:37.294 --> 13:38.861
Then he won't.

13:38.929 --> 13:41.531
But I owe it to the lives
of those 9 men who died

13:41.598 --> 13:42.831
to try and find out.

13:42.899 --> 13:44.267
Don't you owe it to carruthers

13:44.334 --> 13:46.169
to treat him as
a fellow officer,

13:46.236 --> 13:47.970
not as an animal?

13:48.038 --> 13:50.073
Do you think he's innocent?

13:50.140 --> 13:52.007
I don't know.

13:52.076 --> 13:54.410
It's not for me to decide,
or for you, van.

13:59.550 --> 14:03.653
Ok, chicken. I'll let up
on the third degree.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.188
Looks like I either
have to do that

14:05.256 --> 14:06.622
or get lynched myself.

14:06.690 --> 14:08.425
It's you I'm worried about, van.

14:08.492 --> 14:10.660
I hate to see you so vindictive.

14:32.383 --> 14:34.117
Every move I make's worse.

14:34.185 --> 14:35.785
Ah, come on, Eric, resign...

14:35.853 --> 14:36.953
No!

14:37.021 --> 14:37.988
Aah!

14:38.055 --> 14:40.523
I haven't resigned
a game in 30 years.

14:40.591 --> 14:42.859
I'll be damned if
I'm gonna do it now.

17:00.163 --> 17:01.697
What was that?

17:01.765 --> 17:03.265
What?

17:03.333 --> 17:05.501
I heard something.

17:05.569 --> 17:06.502
What?

17:06.569 --> 17:07.936
I don't know.

17:08.003 --> 17:10.039
I didn't hear anything.

17:10.106 --> 17:12.842
I learned to hear all
over again on Mars.

17:32.362 --> 17:33.696
Who's up there?

17:33.764 --> 17:34.797
Kienholz.

17:39.837 --> 17:43.840
Come, colonel, we
got a game to finish.

17:43.907 --> 17:46.542
Kienholz?

17:46.610 --> 17:48.511
Did you hear anything?

17:57.888 --> 17:59.956
Kienholz?

18:00.023 --> 18:01.624
Now he's hearing things.

18:01.692 --> 18:06.428
Come on, let's get him before
he wakes up the others.

18:06.497 --> 18:09.799
Kienholz?

18:09.867 --> 18:12.101
Carruthers?

18:12.168 --> 18:18.508
Hey, carruthers,
come on down here.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.309
Kienholz is gone.

18:20.377 --> 18:24.313
Kienholz isn't gone,
he's probably just turned in.

18:24.381 --> 18:26.148
I'll check his cabin.

18:31.405 --> 18:34.807
Kienholz?

18:34.875 --> 18:38.944
Kienholz?

18:39.012 --> 18:41.314
He's not in his cabin.

18:41.382 --> 18:42.882
Kienholz?

18:42.949 --> 18:45.385
Will you stop this
nonsense, currathers?

18:51.659 --> 18:55.027
Kienholz?

18:55.095 --> 18:58.197
<i>Kienholz, do you hear me?</i>

18:58.265 --> 19:02.602
<i>Kienholz?</i>

19:02.670 --> 19:04.870
Kienholz?

19:04.938 --> 19:06.673
Kienholz, answer!

19:06.740 --> 19:08.073
What's he hollering about?

19:08.141 --> 19:12.244
I don't know.
He can't find kienholz.

19:12.313 --> 19:14.681
Kienholz, this is royce.
Reply at once.

19:14.748 --> 19:19.001
Reply at once.

19:19.069 --> 19:25.625
Joe, can you hear me?
Reply at once.

19:25.693 --> 19:30.563
Report at once
to the quarters level.

19:30.631 --> 19:35.901
If this is one of his jokes,
I'll make him walk home.

19:35.969 --> 19:38.003
Everybody search the ship.

19:56.490 --> 19:59.525
He isn't here.

19:59.593 --> 20:00.660
Come on.

20:47.608 --> 20:49.108
Not a sign of him.

20:49.175 --> 20:50.877
This is ridiculous.

20:50.944 --> 20:54.313
It's just plain crazy.
Kienholz's gotta be here.

20:54.381 --> 20:55.415
Where's your brother?

20:55.482 --> 20:56.582
He's Comin'.

20:56.650 --> 20:58.183
Hey, gino.

20:58.251 --> 21:00.653
Hey, gino!

21:00.721 --> 21:03.556
Funny, he was right behind me.

21:03.624 --> 21:04.957
Hey, gino!

21:17.638 --> 21:19.038
Gino?

21:19.105 --> 21:21.541
Gino!

21:21.608 --> 21:23.008
Gino?

21:23.076 --> 21:25.812
Hey, gino!

21:25.879 --> 21:27.346
Maybe he went below.

21:27.414 --> 21:29.315
But we were here together.

21:29.382 --> 21:30.917
Now there's 2 of them missing.

21:30.984 --> 21:32.284
This is ridiculous.

21:32.352 --> 21:34.787
There's just no place on this
ship for a man to hide.

21:34.855 --> 21:40.025
Ay, gino, where are you?

21:40.094 --> 21:42.428
Gino?

21:42.496 --> 21:44.830
Where can he be?

21:44.898 --> 21:46.765
If he were here, he'd hear us.

21:46.833 --> 21:49.368
Oh, look, maybe he's hurt.
We've got to find him.

22:18.832 --> 22:22.335
Kienholz.

22:22.402 --> 22:28.807
Lord have mercy on his soul.

22:28.875 --> 22:30.009
C compartment.

22:30.076 --> 22:31.744
First storage, c compartment.

22:31.811 --> 22:33.613
Come quick. Come quick.

22:33.680 --> 22:37.550
All hands on the double.

22:37.618 --> 22:39.552
What's the matter?

22:39.620 --> 22:41.020
What happened?

22:41.087 --> 22:42.155
What happened?

22:42.222 --> 22:43.789
Shush!

22:43.857 --> 22:48.060
Hey, maybe gino's up there.

22:48.128 --> 22:51.130
No. No, he's not there.

22:51.198 --> 22:52.532
Over here.

23:05.279 --> 23:07.913
If he's in there, we can get
him through this hatch.

23:07.981 --> 23:10.650
I'll go, I know the
layout in there.

23:47.403 --> 23:49.438
He's in here.

23:49.506 --> 23:51.406
Gino!

23:51.475 --> 23:53.542
Gino!

23:53.610 --> 23:55.177
Gino. He found gino.

23:55.244 --> 23:56.946
Easy, Bob.

23:57.013 --> 24:00.015
He's alive!

24:00.083 --> 24:01.350
Gino?

24:01.417 --> 24:02.518
Gino?

24:02.586 --> 24:04.587
Gino?

24:04.654 --> 24:06.221
Gino!

24:06.289 --> 24:07.222
Gino?

24:10.660 --> 24:11.160
Help!

24:38.722 --> 24:40.923
You're not gonna
leave gino up there.

24:40.991 --> 24:42.758
Get him out of here!

24:42.826 --> 24:44.593
Get my brother outta there.

24:44.661 --> 24:45.861
Get out of here, will ya?

24:45.929 --> 24:47.563
Get a head start. Go!

25:16.843 --> 25:18.610
What are you gonna
do with those?

25:18.679 --> 25:20.713
We can wire 'em
up to the hatches.

25:20.781 --> 25:26.752
Let's do it!

25:26.820 --> 25:29.221
Put up the grille. Hurry up.

26:54.374 --> 26:56.441
There wasn't anything
else to do, Bob.

26:56.509 --> 26:57.576
I know how you feel,

26:57.644 --> 26:59.745
but there wasn't anything
else we could do.

26:59.813 --> 27:01.113
We could've tried.

27:01.181 --> 27:05.317
You heard what Jack said.
Gino was past help...

27:05.385 --> 27:11.590
We should've tried.

27:11.658 --> 27:14.160
Sooner or later, he's gotta
come out of the duct.

27:14.227 --> 27:17.780
Right into the grenades.

27:17.847 --> 27:23.519
There, you'll be all right,
but you have to rest.

27:23.586 --> 27:25.621
Jack, nobody blames you.

27:37.334 --> 27:41.169
Do you know what
happened to kienholz?

27:41.237 --> 27:44.005
Every bone in his body
must be broken.

27:44.073 --> 27:46.241
I'm not sure that's
what killed him.

27:46.309 --> 27:48.711
That shriveled-up effect...

27:48.778 --> 27:53.181
I'll have to do an autopsy.

27:53.249 --> 27:59.137
What is that thing down there?

27:59.205 --> 28:03.008
Carruthers?

28:03.076 --> 28:04.610
What is it?

28:04.678 --> 28:06.679
Do you know what
it is, carruthers?

28:06.746 --> 28:08.046
No.

28:08.114 --> 28:09.515
I have a theory

28:09.583 --> 28:11.817
based on what you
and Jack told me.

28:11.885 --> 28:14.854
You say it's man-shaped,
humanoid.

28:14.921 --> 28:17.890
Perhaps there was once
a civilization on Mars.

28:17.958 --> 28:23.629
It ended. Disease,
war, something terrible.

28:23.697 --> 28:26.231
The martians that were left
went back to barbarism.

28:26.533 --> 28:29.684
Savage murderers.

28:29.753 --> 28:36.391
Maybe that's what
we've got on board.

28:36.459 --> 28:36.959
Bob?

28:42.232 --> 28:45.234
I was only 3 feet away from him.

28:45.301 --> 28:48.637
He was shaking his head,
trying to warn me.

28:48.704 --> 28:52.274
I was that close and
I couldn't help him.

28:52.341 --> 28:55.543
Instead I ran.

28:55.611 --> 28:59.281
Why don't you hate me, too?

28:59.348 --> 29:02.851
At least carruthers did
what he thought was right.

29:02.919 --> 29:06.188
If anybody did a wrong
thing, it was me.

29:06.256 --> 29:10.325
But please believe me,
we couldn't of saved him.

29:10.393 --> 29:14.329
Gino knew that.
Gino knew that himself.

29:14.397 --> 29:19.334
I don't blame carruthers, you,
I don't blame anybody.

29:19.402 --> 29:21.703
It's just that he's down there.

29:27.694 --> 29:30.128
How could that thing
have gotten aboard?

29:30.196 --> 29:32.364
And why? Just to kill us?

29:32.432 --> 29:35.668
What is the usual reason
an intelligent creature kills.

29:35.735 --> 29:37.302
It's hungry?

29:37.370 --> 29:39.905
What makes you so certain
it's intelligent, colonel,

29:39.973 --> 29:41.674
not just an animal?

29:41.741 --> 29:44.242
It opened the door
to c compartment.

33:46.585 --> 33:49.454
Eric?

33:49.522 --> 33:52.958
Those gas grenades
that gino made up.

33:53.026 --> 33:54.192
He joked about them,

33:54.260 --> 33:56.528
said if we ran into
any dinosaurs on Mars,

33:56.595 --> 33:58.530
the grenades would
take care of them,

33:58.597 --> 34:02.000
but... If nothing else
works, maybe gas?

34:02.068 --> 34:04.335
They're in the
chemical cabinet, Eric.

34:20.670 --> 34:23.737
We'll use them as a last resort.

34:23.806 --> 34:26.306
Jim, will you get out
the gas masks?

36:19.004 --> 36:21.673
The second storage hatch.
Close it! Close it!

36:40.593 --> 36:42.661
Bullets, grenades,
nothing stops it.

36:42.728 --> 36:44.463
What do we do now?

36:55.307 --> 36:56.708
What'd you find out?

36:56.776 --> 36:58.443
There's not a molecule of oxygen

36:58.511 --> 37:01.245
or a drop of water
left in kienholz's body.

37:01.313 --> 37:02.814
Water?

37:02.882 --> 37:04.148
Blood,

37:04.216 --> 37:07.085
bone marrow,
glandular secretion,

37:07.152 --> 37:08.954
moisture in the tissues...

37:09.021 --> 37:13.091
Every ounce of edible fluid
in his body is gone.

37:13.158 --> 37:15.627
Probably through
some osmosis process,

37:15.695 --> 37:17.562
there are no punctures.

37:17.630 --> 37:19.498
That's what killed him.

37:19.565 --> 37:21.533
Cellular collapse
and dehydration,

37:21.601 --> 37:23.568
not being crushed
into that duct.

37:23.636 --> 37:24.936
It holds together.

37:25.004 --> 37:28.406
Mars is a world almost totally
without water or oxygen.

37:28.474 --> 37:30.041
The creature's entire
being is probably

37:30.109 --> 37:32.010
organized to feed
in that manner.

37:32.077 --> 37:33.578
It preys on smaller creatures,

37:33.646 --> 37:35.547
which in turn feed
off the sand itself,

37:35.615 --> 37:41.620
converting their intake
and hoarding it as water.

37:44.790 --> 37:46.791
I'm worried about van.

37:46.859 --> 37:49.394
Infection's set in and I
can't seem to control it.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.878
It's exploring, testing.

38:32.254 --> 38:34.755
It can get through
the center hatches.

38:34.824 --> 38:36.090
It has to kill us or starve,

38:36.158 --> 38:38.626
and we've got to kill it or die.

38:50.456 --> 38:52.691
Why is it so quiet now?

38:52.758 --> 38:57.161
Why doesn't it attack?

38:57.230 --> 38:58.697
'Cause it's got gino, huh?

38:58.764 --> 39:02.467
Bob, look, I've got an idea.

39:10.409 --> 39:12.510
How is he?

39:12.578 --> 39:15.146
It's an alien bacteria
of some kind.

39:15.214 --> 39:17.882
So far the infection
isn't critical,

39:17.950 --> 39:19.951
but our drugs don't
even touch it.

39:30.980 --> 39:35.282
Col. Carruthers.

39:35.350 --> 39:37.251
I know this may sound horrible,

39:37.319 --> 39:43.958
but you were right
and we were all wrong.

39:44.026 --> 39:46.193
It's taken this to prove it.

39:52.301 --> 39:54.869
Anne?

39:54.937 --> 39:55.937
Anne?

40:23.065 --> 40:23.965
It's moving around.

40:24.033 --> 40:26.067
Jimmy?

40:26.135 --> 40:28.837
Anne?

40:28.904 --> 40:31.039
Bob and I have a suggestion.

40:31.107 --> 40:32.573
We could get around
behind the creature

40:32.641 --> 40:36.077
by going out the control
room emergency air lock,

40:36.145 --> 40:37.745
moving down the hull

40:37.813 --> 40:39.747
to the emergency air
lock on the motor level.

40:39.815 --> 40:41.816
That would put us
one level below it.

40:41.883 --> 40:43.551
We might be able to
surprise it that way.

40:43.619 --> 40:45.520
If we knew what
to surprise it with.

40:45.588 --> 40:47.222
I've been thinking of something.

40:47.289 --> 40:49.957
At least, it's worth a chance.

40:50.025 --> 40:52.560
Exactly 520 minutes,

40:52.628 --> 40:54.095
10 seconds,

40:54.163 --> 40:55.463
now.

40:55.531 --> 40:56.598
We'll time it to get to

40:56.665 --> 40:59.834
the motor level air
lock at exactly 525.

40:59.901 --> 41:01.269
Start making noise then,

41:01.337 --> 41:04.005
not a lot, just talk,
move around.

41:04.072 --> 41:06.107
Don't make it sound threatening.

41:06.175 --> 41:08.042
Just enough to keep
his attention away

41:08.110 --> 41:10.878
in case we make
noise coming in below.

41:23.925 --> 41:28.796
Good luck,
in case we don't come back.

41:28.864 --> 41:32.066
I said, "good luck,
in case we don't come back."

44:00.549 --> 44:02.850
<i>The plan is a simple one.</i>

44:02.918 --> 44:05.219
<i>While the rest try to hold
the attention of the beast</i>

44:05.287 --> 44:07.121
<i>with their talk and footsteps,</i>

44:07.556 --> 44:10.958
<i>we will attempt to get to
a level below the monster.</i>

44:11.026 --> 44:13.094
<i>Our only hope is
that this will be</i>

44:13.162 --> 44:15.897
<i>the last attempt we have
to make to kill the thing.</i>

44:24.739 --> 44:27.241
I've gotta fix that
pillow for van.

44:34.032 --> 44:36.868
I'm sure they will.
They'll be all right.

45:24.549 --> 45:29.287
I hope they're making noise.

46:17.853 --> 46:24.192
Do you think they're gonna
be all right down there?

46:24.259 --> 46:25.843
<i>Grenades, gas and bullets</i>

46:25.911 --> 46:27.812
<i>have failed to stop the beast,</i>

46:27.880 --> 46:30.514
<i>but perhaps it can
be electrocuted.</i>

46:42.695 --> 46:44.278
<i>There's enough voltage
in these lines</i>

46:44.346 --> 46:47.548
<i>to kill 30 human beings.</i>

46:47.615 --> 46:50.268
<i>The only drawback is,
the thing isn't human.</i>

47:12.724 --> 47:15.660
I know, but they'll be back up.
They'll be all right.

48:39.578 --> 48:40.078
Ah!

49:09.174 --> 49:10.274
Hey!

49:10.342 --> 49:12.543
I can't make it.
My leg's broken!

49:12.610 --> 49:14.378
Get out! Get help!

49:51.916 --> 49:56.587
I've switched the intercom
to pickup his suit-radio.

49:56.654 --> 49:59.523
Calder? Calder, can you hear me?

49:59.591 --> 50:01.675
<i>Loud and clear.</i>

50:01.743 --> 50:03.810
It's nice to have company.

50:03.878 --> 50:05.379
<i>Are you all right?</i>

50:05.447 --> 50:07.781
I'm alive, if that's
what you mean.

50:07.849 --> 50:12.119
I picked a good spot, right
between the induction pumps.

50:12.186 --> 50:13.887
You mean it can't get at you?

50:13.955 --> 50:16.423
<i>It could, if I didn't
have this torch.</i>

50:16.491 --> 50:18.925
To reach me, it has
to stretch down in.

50:18.993 --> 50:22.563
Every time it does, I give it
the torch in the eyes.

50:22.631 --> 50:23.864
Can you reach the lock?

50:23.932 --> 50:26.901
<i>No. No chance.</i>

50:26.968 --> 50:29.904
<i>Looks like I'm here
for the duration.</i>

50:29.971 --> 50:31.638
<i>Oops! Here it comes again.</i>

50:41.483 --> 50:43.250
Calder?

50:43.318 --> 50:46.203
<i>Still here.</i>

50:46.271 --> 50:47.505
The plate on this torch says,

50:47.572 --> 50:50.041
"good for three
hours continuous use."

50:50.108 --> 50:53.477
And to return it for your
money back if unsatisfied.

50:53.479 --> 50:54.928
Hang on, Jim.

50:54.996 --> 50:57.598
We'll leave the intercom on.
Just hang on.

50:57.666 --> 50:59.400
Sure. What else?

50:59.467 --> 51:01.902
<i>Will you keep us informed
of its movements...</i>

51:01.969 --> 51:04.121
we'll try to figure
how to get you out.

51:04.189 --> 51:06.190
<i>Just send care packages.</i>

51:13.365 --> 51:18.402
You know, if that thing should
attack the induction pumps or...

51:18.470 --> 51:19.937
The bank of control relays,

51:20.004 --> 51:22.940
we couldn't maneuver the ship or land it.
we'd just...

51:23.007 --> 51:24.241
Drift right past earth

51:24.309 --> 51:26.177
towards interstellar
space. We'd...

51:26.244 --> 51:30.481
Drift forever.

52:23.116 --> 52:24.967
So I decided after
one bad marriage

52:25.034 --> 52:28.937
to bury myself in science.

52:29.005 --> 52:33.442
I didn't want anybody.

52:33.510 --> 52:37.546
Van changed your mind?

52:40.617 --> 52:43.352
If we get out of this, I'd...

53:26.246 --> 53:28.414
Eric?

53:28.481 --> 53:30.883
The bacteria is attacking
the bone marrow,

53:30.951 --> 53:34.320
resulting in a
leukemia condition.

53:34.388 --> 53:37.790
I can fight it with
drugs, but slowly.

53:37.857 --> 53:41.994
Too slowly.

53:42.062 --> 53:43.629
If they're going to live,

53:43.696 --> 53:48.134
they've got to have
fresh blood constantly...

53:48.201 --> 53:55.241
And there's no more
up here in the dispensary.

53:55.309 --> 53:57.910
Then we've got to
go down and get it.

54:05.852 --> 54:07.019
Sir,

54:07.087 --> 54:08.687
if...

54:08.755 --> 54:12.959
You couldn't help calder.

54:13.026 --> 54:15.127
You had to...

54:15.195 --> 54:18.965
You had to leave him there.

54:19.032 --> 54:21.033
Well...

54:21.101 --> 54:25.471
What did you do, carruthers?

54:25.538 --> 54:30.142
Throw him in as bait
so you could get away?

54:30.210 --> 54:31.978
Van.

54:32.045 --> 54:33.012
How...

54:33.080 --> 54:34.280
How come you...

54:36.516 --> 54:40.353
How come you always get
away without a scratch?

54:40.420 --> 54:42.721
He doesn't know
what he's saying.

54:42.789 --> 54:44.606
<i>I heard that.
Tell him he's nuts.</i>

54:44.674 --> 54:49.295
<i>Van heusen's got it all wrong.</i>

54:49.362 --> 54:51.063
Hey, can anybody hear me?

54:51.131 --> 54:54.233
<i>Van heusen's got it all wrong.</i>

54:54.301 --> 54:58.270
We hear you, Jim. Thanks.

54:58.338 --> 55:00.072
Somehow we've got
to get that blood.

55:00.140 --> 55:01.874
Well, this time it's my turn.

55:01.942 --> 55:03.042
I'm going with you.

55:03.109 --> 55:06.078
All right, we'll
make a run for it.

55:06.146 --> 55:07.713
One thing,

55:07.780 --> 55:09.581
remember there's only
10 feet of ladder

55:09.649 --> 55:11.783
between it and us when
we get down there.

55:11.852 --> 55:13.452
So, we better take
it slow and easy.

55:13.519 --> 55:15.787
One sound, and we're dead.

55:15.856 --> 55:19.391
Let's take our boots off, huh.

55:19.459 --> 55:20.759
Here are the inventory numbers.

55:20.827 --> 55:23.295
Type o, compartment x-1,
storage b.

55:23.363 --> 55:25.664
They're all marked.

55:25.732 --> 55:26.298
Calder?

55:26.366 --> 55:28.033
I'm with it.

55:28.101 --> 55:29.235
I'll let out a shout

55:29.302 --> 55:31.586
if the critter even
looks at the ladder.

55:31.654 --> 55:34.422
<i>Right now, it's just
prowlin' around.</i>

55:34.490 --> 55:35.557
<i>Good luck.</i>

55:35.625 --> 55:37.126
Thanks.

55:37.193 --> 55:39.694
<i>Hey, this might be
worth something.</i>

55:51.607 --> 55:53.708
It just went in the
reactor room.

55:53.710 --> 55:56.178
This might be the break
we're waiting for.

55:56.246 --> 55:57.963
It took gino with him.

55:58.031 --> 55:59.231
Calder, listen,

55:59.299 --> 56:00.900
I'm going to close the door
to the reactor room.

56:00.967 --> 56:02.201
Let me know what
he does, will ya?

56:02.269 --> 56:04.503
<i>Roger.</i>

56:18.168 --> 56:20.068
Calder?

56:20.136 --> 56:21.870
What's happening?

56:21.937 --> 56:25.040
Nothing. Not a squawk.

56:25.108 --> 56:31.713
We're Comin' down.

56:31.781 --> 56:34.216
Eric?

56:34.284 --> 56:37.319
Van'll appreciate it. Come back.

57:36.479 --> 57:39.381
Maybe we can get calder
out of there now.

57:39.449 --> 57:40.749
Bob...

57:40.816 --> 57:44.986
Take a look.

57:45.054 --> 57:47.689
We'd better hurry
and get that blood.

58:00.303 --> 58:03.272
Easy, Bob, easy. No noise!

58:03.339 --> 58:04.506
Okay, Jimmy.

58:14.217 --> 58:15.750
No! Van, no!

58:15.818 --> 58:17.219
No! Let me go!

58:17.287 --> 58:18.787
<i>Let me go!</i>

58:20.123 --> 58:22.324
Let go of me. Van...

58:22.392 --> 58:23.926
I know what I'm doing.

58:23.993 --> 58:25.127
Please, van.

58:25.194 --> 58:26.628
We can unshield the reactor.

58:26.695 --> 58:29.097
The radiation...
The radiation will kill it.

58:29.165 --> 58:31.133
It's too dangerous
while they're down there.

58:31.200 --> 58:33.302
If the creature
breaks loose he'll...

58:33.369 --> 58:34.836
Wait until they come back.

58:34.904 --> 58:38.307
<i>It's a good idea,
but, van, please.</i>

58:38.374 --> 58:39.474
Now is the time.

58:39.542 --> 58:41.009
No, van, please.

58:51.304 --> 58:54.473
Hurry! Van unshielded
the reactor.

58:54.541 --> 58:57.642
I hope that door holds
if it wants out.

58:57.710 --> 58:59.044
Bob, hurry up.

59:06.186 --> 59:08.087
It's enough to kill 100 men.

59:15.829 --> 59:16.795
Get up the stairs.

59:16.862 --> 59:17.862
I'll be all right.

59:17.930 --> 59:19.098
No, I'm not leaving ya.

59:32.495 --> 59:32.995
Ah! Ah!

59:36.566 --> 59:38.099
It's out!

59:38.167 --> 59:39.735
It's out!

59:39.802 --> 59:41.035
It won't die.

59:41.103 --> 59:43.538
Eric, hurry. Hurry!

59:43.606 --> 59:44.840
What about Bob?

59:44.907 --> 59:46.007
There's nothing we can do!

59:46.075 --> 59:48.810
Get that blood up
there fast! Don't stop!

01:00:04.594 --> 01:00:08.513
Eric.

01:00:08.581 --> 01:00:11.216
Get up to the control
level. Hurry!

01:00:21.627 --> 01:00:23.228
Be careful, dear.

01:01:02.418 --> 01:01:05.820
At least down below
I could've died on a mattress.

01:01:05.888 --> 01:01:07.256
You'll be all right.

01:01:07.323 --> 01:01:09.525
You'll be all right.

01:01:09.592 --> 01:01:16.131
I guess it...
I guess it looks like it's

01:01:16.199 --> 01:01:18.800
you and ed now, huh, chicken?

01:01:18.868 --> 01:01:20.669
What do you mean?

01:01:20.736 --> 01:01:22.070
Uh...

01:01:22.138 --> 01:01:27.742
I got good ears. I can hear.

01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:35.617
You and him,
just out of nowhere.

01:01:35.685 --> 01:01:38.453
Let's talk about it later.

01:01:38.521 --> 01:01:44.459
There isn't any later,
the way things look.

01:01:44.527 --> 01:01:48.129
That's why I asked now...
I, i...

01:01:48.198 --> 01:01:49.798
I just got to know.

01:01:49.865 --> 01:01:51.466
Van, please.

01:01:51.534 --> 01:01:57.072
Anne, where are the flashlights?

01:01:57.139 --> 01:01:58.907
Better get Goin'.

01:02:04.981 --> 01:02:07.348
Mary?

01:02:07.416 --> 01:02:15.416
Am I going to make it? I mean,
if all of us get away, uh...

01:02:15.959 --> 01:02:21.162
Okay, Mary, I understand.

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:23.799
I'm the guy with
all the answers.

01:02:37.146 --> 01:02:40.649
<i>There is nothing
to do but wait now,</i>

01:02:40.717 --> 01:02:42.584
<i>nothing to do but
see if the beast</i>

01:02:42.652 --> 01:02:45.386
<i>will reach us through
the center hatch.</i>

01:02:45.454 --> 01:02:47.689
<i>We can go no higher.</i>

01:02:47.757 --> 01:02:50.859
<i>We are in the top
level of the ship.</i>

01:02:50.927 --> 01:02:54.963
<i>This is where either
we die, or it dies.</i>

01:03:02.271 --> 01:03:03.505
Calder?

01:03:03.572 --> 01:03:05.273
<i>Still alive.</i>

01:03:05.341 --> 01:03:07.075
Don't ask me why I bother.

01:03:07.143 --> 01:03:11.613
Good. Can you see it?

01:03:11.681 --> 01:03:13.749
Big as death.

01:03:13.816 --> 01:03:15.316
It's been sitting here
for the last half hour,

01:03:15.384 --> 01:03:17.753
licking its chops.

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:20.255
Incidently if anybody's
interested at this late date

01:03:20.322 --> 01:03:23.058
I got it figured how
the critter got aboard.

01:03:23.126 --> 01:03:24.259
<i>How?</i>

01:03:24.326 --> 01:03:26.161
It Must've followed
us back to the ship,

01:03:26.228 --> 01:03:28.263
after we picked you up,

01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:30.265
climbed one of the fins

01:03:30.332 --> 01:03:32.534
<i>just before takeoff
and got in through</i>

01:03:32.601 --> 01:03:36.805
<i>the open emergency hatch
in c compartment.</i>

01:03:36.873 --> 01:03:39.607
Sounds right.

01:03:39.676 --> 01:03:41.843
How's the air down there?

01:03:41.911 --> 01:03:43.078
Pretty bad.

01:03:43.146 --> 01:03:46.815
My suit-tank helps,
but it's about empty.

01:03:47.984 --> 01:03:49.284
Ed?

01:03:49.351 --> 01:03:50.418
It's movin'.

01:03:58.327 --> 01:04:00.729
<i>It's going up the ladder.</i>

01:04:00.797 --> 01:04:02.731
I can hear it prowlin'
around up there.

01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:11.707
Anne, Mary, get those
flashlights on quick.

01:04:18.965 --> 01:04:21.432
Ed, it's going up
to first storage,

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.201
<i>banging on everything it passes.</i>

01:04:23.268 --> 01:04:25.303
<i>It's Goin' nuts.</i>

01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:26.805
Can you get to the air lock?

01:04:26.872 --> 01:04:31.743
Why? Look at the pretty stars
through my broken faceplate.

01:04:31.811 --> 01:04:34.012
Get in the air lock
and hide there.

01:04:44.107 --> 01:04:45.640
Eric.

01:04:45.708 --> 01:04:48.043
Take a look at this.

01:04:48.111 --> 01:04:50.979
The oxygen consumption's way up.

01:04:51.047 --> 01:04:53.314
40 percent over every
previous maximum.

01:04:53.382 --> 01:04:56.818
40 percent! Perhaps the
gas from the grenades.

01:04:56.886 --> 01:04:59.888
No, that wouldn't
affect it that much.

01:04:59.956 --> 01:05:04.425
It's not a leak,
the pressure's all right.

01:05:04.493 --> 01:05:06.862
Are you thinking the
same thing I'm thinking?

01:05:06.929 --> 01:05:08.529
The creature?

01:05:08.597 --> 01:05:12.700
It must have enormous lungs
from the thin air on Mars.

01:05:12.769 --> 01:05:14.803
Let all the air out of the ship.

01:05:14.871 --> 01:05:17.105
If we can do it in time,
we can kill it.

01:05:17.173 --> 01:05:18.874
We can build up
our air supply later.

01:05:18.941 --> 01:05:19.707
Right!

01:05:19.776 --> 01:05:21.709
Get your spacesuits on. Quick!

01:06:16.232 --> 01:06:19.501
Aah!

01:06:19.569 --> 01:06:26.641
Drive him below
so I can get to the air lock.

01:06:36.118 --> 01:06:37.618
Ed!

01:08:12.631 --> 01:08:15.383
You have been called here again
to receive further information

01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:18.920
about the story which was
given to you last night.

01:08:18.988 --> 01:08:21.756
I will read you the text of
a teleradio message

01:08:21.823 --> 01:08:25.993
received from the challenge 142
less than an hour ago.

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.129
"This is Eric royce talking.

01:08:28.197 --> 01:08:30.598
"Of the 19 men and women
who have set foot

01:08:30.666 --> 01:08:34.368
upon the planet Mars,
6 will return.

01:08:34.435 --> 01:08:37.138
"There is no longer
a question of murder,

01:08:37.206 --> 01:08:40.108
"but of an alien and
elemental life force.

"A planet so cruel, so hostile,
