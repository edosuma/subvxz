WEBVTT

00:02.750 --> 00:04.150
Hmm...

00:04.630 --> 00:06.730
Hey, are we really going...

00:07.290 --> 00:08.330
Tohya?

00:08.330 --> 00:10.350
Hmm...

01:46.590 --> 01:49.210
Takoyaki!

01:49.880 --> 01:51.820
You can eat later.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.250
We still have things to buy.

01:54.450 --> 01:56.370
You're so mean, Umeko...

01:57.500 --> 02:00.610
You promised not to call me by that name.

02:01.440 --> 02:03.640
Now, let's go.

02:14.610 --> 02:15.820
What's wrong?

02:16.390 --> 02:19.970
Akihabara really has changed...

02:23.030 --> 02:27.270
But it's only been a week, hasn't it?

02:28.090 --> 02:29.720
Since that conference.

02:31.530 --> 02:33.030
If you're that insistent,

02:33.560 --> 02:39.780
why don't you tell us specifically 
what Log Horizon has in mind?

02:42.660 --> 02:48.520
<b>Grab It in Your Hand</b>

02:44.620 --> 02:46.620
Grab It in Your Hand.

02:49.690 --> 02:52.630
I have two primary goals...

02:53.290 --> 02:57.530
My proposal to restore life to the people here, 
and to protect them, is as I've explained.

02:58.560 --> 03:02.090
As for specifics, we'll begin with 
bringing life back to the area.

03:02.490 --> 03:03.300
Marie?

03:04.300 --> 03:06.380
As I believe some of you are aware,

03:06.380 --> 03:09.210
we've been running a restaurant 
called Crescent Moon.

03:09.410 --> 03:12.160
The secret behind its popularity...

03:09.480 --> 03:12.160
You can do it, Marielle.

03:12.160 --> 03:14.910
The secret of how we make 
food with actual flavor...

03:15.430 --> 03:17.630
I shall now reveal it.

03:19.190 --> 03:20.510
This is the trick...

03:20.910 --> 03:22.890
You get normal ingredients,

03:23.290 --> 03:25.650
and you cook them just as in the real world.

03:26.190 --> 03:31.140
And the cook must have a subclass set to chef.

03:32.350 --> 03:35.730
And if their cooking skill isn't 
high enough, they'll fail.

03:36.060 --> 03:37.610
That's all.

03:38.020 --> 03:41.400
The trick is that there is no trick.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.970
So you just cook it yourself, 
instead of using the command menu?

03:46.310 --> 03:48.160
That's all?

03:48.860 --> 03:52.590
I believe this discovery has a number of implications.

03:53.260 --> 03:56.670
Without it, I never would have 
thought to gather you all here.

03:57.740 --> 03:58.720
Michitaka?

03:58.720 --> 03:59.500
Yes...

04:00.040 --> 04:05.290
In conjunction with the Roderic 
Merchant Guild and Shopping Street 8,

04:05.290 --> 04:07.730
our guild has successfully created a steam engine.

04:08.710 --> 04:11.160
A prototype, to be precise.

04:11.570 --> 04:13.300
It still has many flaws,

04:13.300 --> 04:15.810
but it's a proof of concept.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.320
It's amazing you did that in 
fewer than twelve hours.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.820
Wait... What does that mean, exactly?

04:23.300 --> 04:28.830
It means the secret you've just learned about 
cooking is not, in fact, limited to cooking.

04:29.650 --> 04:32.980
When it was a game, <i>Elder Tale</i> 
had no steam engines.

04:33.350 --> 04:34.080
However,

04:34.740 --> 04:37.900
a player with sufficient crafting skill

04:37.900 --> 04:41.550
can take this world's materials and,
without using the command menu,

04:41.550 --> 04:43.240
but with their own hands...

04:43.720 --> 04:47.390
They can invent things that weren't 
originally part of this world.

04:44.410 --> 04:48.370
<b>This is a Steam Engine!!</b>

04:49.720 --> 04:53.110
So now, there'll be a rush to invent things.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.470
And that means a demand for new products.

04:56.470 --> 05:00.110
And purchasing them will require earning money.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.580
That will get the economy running...

05:04.220 --> 05:05.700
In light of this,

05:05.700 --> 05:08.120
we, the three major crafting guilds,

05:08.730 --> 05:11.370
support the creation of the 
Round Table Conference!

05:12.960 --> 05:15.370
That's three...

05:15.800 --> 05:20.140
Part of the reason the town feels 
so dead is simple despair,

05:20.140 --> 05:22.840
but another problem is that 
people have nothing to do.

05:23.720 --> 05:27.890
Surviving in this world costs too little money.

05:28.510 --> 05:30.500
Wouldn't it be better to use some money,

05:30.500 --> 05:33.600
then go earn more, 
so you can then spend that?

05:36.440 --> 05:38.430
To get money and crafting materials,

05:38.430 --> 05:40.470
activities such as hunting become necessary.

05:41.160 --> 05:45.100
That would give the combat 
guilds more work, as bodyguards.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.200
The next problem is safety.

05:48.940 --> 05:52.130
The laws don't have to be that strict.

05:53.090 --> 05:55.410
If you consider fights over 
territory and hunting grounds

05:55.740 --> 05:57.670
to be simply another form of competition,

05:58.120 --> 06:01.200
there isn't any need to ban them outright.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.520
That's right.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.330
However,

06:04.150 --> 06:07.340
certain things go too far, and will need banning.

06:07.340 --> 06:08.680
PKing, for instance.

06:09.600 --> 06:14.000
Why don't we forbid player killing within 
the lower level zones around Akihabara?

06:14.530 --> 06:19.190
Certainly, there's no point in fighting 
players who are below level 50.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.220
Our next issue is one of human rights.

06:22.010 --> 06:24.460
I believe that, with death no longer an absolute,

06:24.950 --> 06:26.420
kidnapping and imprisonment

06:26.420 --> 06:29.200
are far more serious crimes than they 
would have been in the old world.

06:30.080 --> 06:34.370
And leaving or joining a guild 
should be up to the individual.

06:34.370 --> 06:35.380
I agree.

06:35.810 --> 06:37.580
My final suggestion is this...

06:38.150 --> 06:41.630
That these human rights apply 
not only to us adventurers,

06:41.630 --> 06:43.590
but also to the People of the Land.

06:46.930 --> 06:47.840
Huh?

06:48.680 --> 06:52.150
This isn't the <i>Elder Tale</i> that we knew.

06:52.950 --> 06:55.780
The cooking and inventions prove that.

06:56.270 --> 06:57.850
That's true, but...

06:58.180 --> 07:00.600
It's certainly influenced by <i>Elder Tale</i>.

07:01.090 --> 07:04.780
But this is a different world than 
the one we used to know.

07:05.370 --> 07:07.610
We must keep that in mind at all times.

07:07.910 --> 07:11.490
And the People of the Land are 
this world's original residents.

07:11.490 --> 07:14.610
We're the outsiders, 
and we're in the vast minority.

07:15.230 --> 07:18.250
So they aren't simply non-player characters?

07:18.780 --> 07:19.620
Correct.

07:20.130 --> 07:24.270
Each has their own personality, 
concerns, and dreams...

07:24.760 --> 07:26.600
That's idiocy.

07:27.110 --> 07:30.370
Have you ever spoken with any of them?

07:30.910 --> 07:32.710
Why would I?

07:32.710 --> 07:34.670
M-May I say something?

07:35.910 --> 07:39.900
It isn't only adventurers who 
come to Crescent Moon.

07:40.810 --> 07:44.000
Many People of the Land do, too.

07:44.420 --> 07:47.080
They desire good food, as well.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.930
Many People of the Land work in 
the market or the Guild Building.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.320
We can't get by without them,

07:55.320 --> 08:00.000
but they would probably be 
perfectly fine without us.

08:01.130 --> 08:04.780
If we cannot govern ourselves, 
then before too long,

08:04.780 --> 08:09.010
relations with them will be 
damaged beyond repair.

08:14.050 --> 08:15.850
Are you implying

08:15.850 --> 08:19.520
there's a possibility of war with 
the People of the Land?

08:19.950 --> 08:23.520
I think that's a question for the Round Table.

08:34.130 --> 08:38.480
D.D.D. agrees to the establishment 
of the Round Table Conference,

08:38.480 --> 08:39.950
and will participate.

08:40.570 --> 08:42.750
As does the West Wind Brigade.

08:43.230 --> 08:46.800
It's been a long time since I've seen 
you in such total control, Shiroe.

08:47.430 --> 08:49.340
I just wish you'd joined us.

08:49.760 --> 08:52.340
We cannot split Akihabara...

08:53.340 --> 08:55.200
The Black Sword Knights will also participate!

08:55.660 --> 08:57.600
Honesty agrees, as well.

09:00.190 --> 09:01.350
So does Grandeur.

09:01.620 --> 09:03.550
And Radio Market.

09:03.550 --> 09:04.980
W-We, too...

09:04.980 --> 09:07.610
The Crescent Moon Alliance agrees with pleasure!

09:15.150 --> 09:19.870
And so, that day, the Round Table 
Conference was founded...

09:20.180 --> 09:22.480
And the secret of the recipes was publicized.

09:23.160 --> 09:27.130
This world is not the <i>Elder Tale</i> we knew.

09:27.850 --> 09:30.770
We must accept this fact.

09:31.340 --> 09:33.240
Regarding security and human rights...

09:33.240 --> 09:35.910
Our next goal is to gather information

09:35.910 --> 09:39.670
about the closed transport gates and 
fairy rings, as well as other zones...

09:39.670 --> 09:41.200
Um, well...

09:42.280 --> 09:43.860
Let's all get along!

09:43.860 --> 09:48.470
Each use of the Guild Building will cost one gold.

09:48.470 --> 09:50.060
This will serve as a tax...

09:54.320 --> 09:58.410
And this will be the first day 
of a huge celebration!

09:58.680 --> 10:00.520
Eat up!

10:08.070 --> 10:10.980
Hamelin shut down, as well...

10:13.620 --> 10:17.360
Shiroe denied them access to the Guild Building,

10:17.780 --> 10:21.710
so for a while, they were locked in their guild hall.

10:22.300 --> 10:26.860
And then they realized that 
they could use Call of Home,

10:26.860 --> 10:30.560
the return spell, to get outside the gate.

10:30.840 --> 10:34.160
Some of them escaped by killing themselves,

10:34.160 --> 10:36.830
so they would revive at the Cathedral.

10:37.220 --> 10:41.270
Regardless, they can't use 
this Guild Building anymore.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.830
Every last one of them has left town.

10:46.230 --> 10:47.910
Yeah...

10:48.900 --> 10:53.590
But all the children who fled 
Hamelin said they want to join us.

10:53.990 --> 10:57.870
We had to move into a larger guild hall 
to accommodate all the new members.

10:57.870 --> 11:02.870
During the escape, Shouryuu may 
have been a bit too impressive.

11:03.270 --> 11:06.850
Like a newborn chick that confuses 
the first toy it sees for its mother,

11:07.260 --> 11:09.030
they're imprinted on him.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.990
<i>I wonder what Nyanta's up to...</i>

11:16.330 --> 11:20.780
I can't believe Shiro kept all that in motion 
behind the scenes at the conference.

11:21.060 --> 11:24.210
I had no idea, either.

11:24.210 --> 11:27.130
He really did destroy an entire guild...

11:27.130 --> 11:28.880
He can be such a scary boy.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.540
He's dangerous!

11:31.630 --> 11:35.690
Come to think of it, I haven't seen them today...

11:37.310 --> 11:40.070
Actually, they're moving today, too.

11:40.070 --> 11:41.050
Oh?

11:42.210 --> 11:43.050
Hey, Shiro...

11:43.850 --> 11:45.270
Where do you want this?

11:46.230 --> 11:47.460
Over there, please.

11:53.330 --> 11:56.480
Wow... It's looking pretty good.

11:57.060 --> 11:58.240
Karashin?

12:01.380 --> 12:02.520
What'd he say?

12:02.780 --> 12:06.410
He suggested hiring People of the Land 
to handle the Round Table's paperwork.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.320
He's right that it'd be cheaper than hiring players.

12:10.870 --> 12:12.670
They say that People of the Land

12:13.110 --> 12:17.170
have come from other cities after 
hearing rumors about our cooking.

12:22.270 --> 12:23.090
My lord,

12:23.470 --> 12:29.080
I have already seen several of 
them infiltrating Akihabara.

12:30.510 --> 12:31.820
So it would seem.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.020
Shiroe, from Log Horizon, said

12:34.390 --> 12:36.360
that the Round Table would decide

12:36.360 --> 12:41.270
if we go to war against the 
People of the Land, but...

12:41.810 --> 12:44.910
The People of the Land may end up deciding.

12:48.830 --> 12:51.710
They appear to have begun already.

12:52.780 --> 12:55.360
What will you do, Villain in Glasses?

13:03.850 --> 13:07.140
We should assume they've already started...

13:09.930 --> 13:11.490
This place is huge!

13:15.320 --> 13:18.250
This hairstyle is adorable, too!

13:18.250 --> 13:20.200
I'm in the middle of cleaning...

13:20.200 --> 13:24.030
I've brought you a moving present!

13:25.880 --> 13:27.870
Now, we take this...

13:27.870 --> 13:28.560
Stop...

13:28.560 --> 13:29.530
Isn't that...

13:29.530 --> 13:30.550
A children's festival kimono?

13:30.550 --> 13:32.190
Shiroe, Naotsugu...

13:32.190 --> 13:33.710
This is a moving present!

13:34.120 --> 13:34.960
Takoyaki...

13:35.240 --> 13:36.080
Okonomiyaki...

13:36.440 --> 13:37.710
And crêpes!

13:37.710 --> 13:39.430
Even the dessert's a fried food?!

13:39.430 --> 13:40.960
Th-There's so much—

13:40.590 --> 13:41.880
Don't be modest.

13:41.880 --> 13:45.720
You have to eat a lot, or you won't 
grow up big, like Naotsugu.

13:46.020 --> 13:47.480
Right, Naotsugu?

13:47.830 --> 13:49.870
Huh? Wait, Naotsugu...

13:49.870 --> 13:51.610
Have you gotten bigger again?

13:52.110 --> 13:53.140
No way...

13:53.660 --> 13:55.190
Put it on!

13:53.660 --> 13:56.040
That's a suit of armor.

13:55.190 --> 13:56.070
I refuse!

13:56.040 --> 13:58.590
Hey, everyone's here.

13:56.070 --> 13:58.070
Put it on!

14:01.520 --> 14:03.140
Shiroe... Naotsugu...

14:03.140 --> 14:04.400
Hi, there!

14:04.690 --> 14:07.410
Souji! Nazuna!

14:07.410 --> 14:09.000
Welcome.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.410
Hey there, Chief.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.850
Do you know them, my lord?

14:12.850 --> 14:13.650
Yeah.

14:13.650 --> 14:16.040
Nazuna was also in the Tea Party.

14:16.560 --> 14:17.910
This is for you.

14:19.220 --> 14:22.040
Cherry sake from our brewmaster.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.920
I can't wait to try it.

14:25.390 --> 14:27.860
This guild hall is amazing...

14:27.860 --> 14:28.870
Really...

14:28.870 --> 14:30.350
It must've cost a fortune.

14:30.350 --> 14:31.610
Not at all.

14:31.980 --> 14:32.680
Look...

14:33.000 --> 14:37.900
That tree destroyed the elevator hallway and 
stairs, so it was abandoned and quite cheap.

14:38.390 --> 14:40.290
It's far from the city center, too.

14:40.950 --> 14:44.360
What did you do about the stairs and flooring?

14:44.360 --> 14:46.240
I asked Michitaka...

14:47.770 --> 14:49.160
I see.

14:49.160 --> 14:50.700
Then if we remodel them,

14:51.050 --> 14:56.060
all the previously uninhabitable abandoned 
buildings could be used for new things.

14:56.060 --> 14:58.580
So, about the remodeling cost...

14:59.880 --> 15:03.370
Hey, don't rip us off, okay?

15:03.370 --> 15:08.050
To be honest, I have no idea how to price it.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.220
Huh?

15:09.220 --> 15:12.050
The crafting and construction processes

15:12.050 --> 15:14.960
are so different than the real world.

15:15.860 --> 15:17.080
In other words,

15:17.080 --> 15:20.270
they don't know the appropriate 
prices for anything in this world?

15:21.230 --> 15:25.260
<i>Our economic system still has many holes.</i>

15:25.640 --> 15:28.150
Isaac, from the Black Sword Knights, was also here!

15:30.470 --> 15:32.180
This place is pretty big.

15:33.580 --> 15:34.860
Isaac!

15:35.350 --> 15:37.190
Hey, Villain in Glasses...

15:37.190 --> 15:40.580
It's perfect. Let my summoners train here.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.910
W-Wait a second, Isaac—

15:42.910 --> 15:43.500
Do it!

15:49.420 --> 15:50.680
Cosplay?!

16:06.980 --> 16:08.250
Later.

16:09.320 --> 16:11.900
So, the Black Swords came here...

16:12.300 --> 16:15.370
They aren't all that bad.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.330
We're making a huge bath area now.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.420
Come over when it's done, okay?

16:22.810 --> 16:23.450
Yeah.

16:23.800 --> 16:26.130
See you soon, Akatsuki...

16:26.130 --> 16:28.560
When we can take our time!

16:29.870 --> 16:32.630
Shiro, you've built a lovely house.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.420
See you!

16:36.420 --> 16:37.450
We'll be going, too.

16:37.450 --> 16:38.170
Oh...

16:39.100 --> 16:41.290
Are Tohya and Minori doing well?

16:41.780 --> 16:43.130
Eh? Ah...

16:43.130 --> 16:45.470
Haven't they told you yet?

16:49.660 --> 16:51.260
Nothing!

16:51.260 --> 16:52.800
See you soon, Shiro.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.000
Sure...

16:59.140 --> 17:00.990
Are you going shopping, master?

17:00.990 --> 17:03.220
Buying stuff for dinner.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.450
Tonight, it's everyone's favorite, curry.

17:07.770 --> 17:10.050
My lord, we're having curry tonight!

17:10.270 --> 17:11.900
What? Curry?!

17:14.380 --> 17:16.110
I love curry!

17:16.110 --> 17:17.240
Hey, Naotsugu...

17:17.240 --> 17:18.680
It's curry tonight!

17:18.950 --> 17:19.980
Seriously?

17:21.460 --> 17:22.960
Yahoo!

17:23.450 --> 17:24.630
Bye.

17:24.630 --> 17:25.820
Bye!

17:26.740 --> 17:29.100
Curry... It's been so long...

17:29.100 --> 17:29.940
Curry!

17:31.300 --> 17:34.730
I'm honestly not sure which is better...

17:34.730 --> 17:36.360
Curry or bo—

17:37.800 --> 17:39.920
My lord, may I roundhouse kick this pervert—

17:39.920 --> 17:41.790
For once, let me finish!

17:42.170 --> 17:44.400
Don't compare curry with something perverted.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.910
The chief's curry is for grown-ups... It's spicy.

17:48.910 --> 17:50.690
Can you eat it, shrimp?

17:51.420 --> 17:52.840
It is?

18:04.650 --> 18:06.560
I'm starting a new guild.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.360
Will you join?

18:13.040 --> 18:14.280
What's this, Shiro?

18:14.280 --> 18:16.220
You finally got around to it?

18:16.220 --> 18:21.500
I thought that from here on out, we were 
just going to be a nameless guild.

18:21.910 --> 18:24.700
It is a ninja's task to follow her master.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.080
Just give me your orders, my lord.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.220
Spicy, grown-up curry, huh...

18:38.260 --> 18:42.930
<i>Maybe I should've thought of 
a better way to phrase it.</i>

18:41.220 --> 18:42.930
Wait, don't call me a shrimp!

18:51.300 --> 18:53.740
Looking for party members!

18:53.740 --> 18:55.940
We're leaving tomorrow morning!

18:55.940 --> 18:59.350
<b>We'll Take Anyone     Recruiting Now     Weak Players Welcome</b>

18:57.040 --> 18:59.490
I'd like to have one more...

19:00.030 --> 19:02.440
Then join my party.

19:03.570 --> 19:05.230
I'm alone at the moment.

19:05.700 --> 19:08.760
This is perfect. Our meeting must have been fated.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.710
Nice timing.

19:11.060 --> 19:11.820
Huh?

19:11.820 --> 19:13.670
What level are you?

19:15.860 --> 19:17.020
20... Why?

19:17.950 --> 19:20.820
We only want people over level 40.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.280
Wh-What?

19:25.740 --> 19:27.280
No mild curry!

19:27.280 --> 19:28.500
Spicy is out of the question.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.970
I'm back.

19:30.990 --> 19:33.320
You're back already, master?

19:34.380 --> 19:36.740
Is the curry party off?

19:37.160 --> 19:42.120
I found them wandering around the 
building, so I brought them up.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.280
Tohya! Minori!

19:46.720 --> 19:49.900
I heard that the Crescent Moon 
Alliance was moving today.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.080
Um...

19:51.080 --> 19:52.130
Actually, mister...

19:52.630 --> 19:54.620
Um, well...

19:57.240 --> 20:01.130
We've come to join your guild!

20:02.860 --> 20:06.390
We'd like you to teach us.

20:07.060 --> 20:11.090
This past week, the Crescent Moon 
Alliance was very good to us,

20:11.090 --> 20:12.990
but we haven't joined them!

20:14.060 --> 20:17.400
We made it this far thanks to what you taught us.

20:18.430 --> 20:20.980
If you've made a guild, we want to be in it!

20:21.390 --> 20:24.430
I may be weak now, but I'll get strong!

20:24.430 --> 20:25.420
Me, too!

20:25.420 --> 20:27.410
I may slow you down, but...

20:27.950 --> 20:31.040
But I decided not to use that 
as an excuse anymore!

20:31.660 --> 20:33.470
Let us join you!

20:33.640 --> 20:35.890
Well... Uh...

20:45.520 --> 20:46.740
Shiroe...

20:47.530 --> 20:50.100
Don't just stand there.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.840
You're a guild master.

20:54.260 --> 20:57.020
<i>A guild master... A guild master?</i>

20:58.080 --> 20:59.460
<i>The leader of a guild...</i>

21:01.220 --> 21:02.360
<i>Right.</i>

21:02.360 --> 21:03.280
<i>I am.</i>

21:04.730 --> 21:05.530
<i>Now...</i>

21:06.400 --> 21:08.100
<i>It's my turn to lead everyone.</i>

21:14.290 --> 21:17.040
Okay, Log Horizon welcomes you,

21:17.980 --> 21:19.890
Tohya and Minori!

21:21.320 --> 21:23.220
As new members, your first mission

21:23.740 --> 21:26.430
is to eat curry with the leaders.

21:26.840 --> 21:27.430
Got it?

21:27.780 --> 21:28.810
Mister...

21:28.810 --> 21:29.670
Yeah!

21:29.670 --> 21:32.110
Actually, it isn't done yet.

21:33.310 --> 21:34.120
It's great!

21:34.420 --> 21:38.510
Yeah, nothing beats curry under a night sky.

21:38.510 --> 21:41.060
I just wish I had something to go with it...

21:41.550 --> 21:44.260
Next time, I'll make some curry relish.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.450
I love you, Chief!

22:08.870 --> 22:10.520
A Round Table Conference?

22:11.410 --> 22:12.450
I see.

22:12.860 --> 22:15.170
The adventurers of Akihabara...

22:19.220 --> 22:20.730
Lord Sergiatte...

22:24.280 --> 22:27.850
I've brought Lady Lenessia.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.710
Peace has come to Akihabara.

24:07.710 --> 24:11.840
Minori and Tohya join Log Horizon, 
and train every day.

24:11.840 --> 24:16.310
Shiroe decides to hold a training 
camp for new players.

24:16.310 --> 24:19.000
Meanwhile, a letter comes to the Round Table.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.600
It's from the People of the Land.

24:21.600 --> 24:30.030
<b>An Invitation from Eastal</b>

24:21.860 --> 24:24.300
Next time: An Invitation from Eastal.

24:24.660 --> 24:27.430
Always look thirty seconds ahead.
