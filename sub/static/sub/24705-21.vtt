00:32.558 --> 00:35.584
- Hey, how's it going, Mr. Mac?
- Oh, pretty good.

00:35.661 --> 00:39.791
- How's my brother?
- Hard being a young person nowadays.

00:39.866 --> 00:42.300
Yeah. I know what you mean.

00:47.707 --> 00:49.868
- Hey.
- Hola.

00:55.281 --> 00:57.772
- Hey.
- I guess you're not at work.

00:58.951 --> 01:02.045
Oh, that guy, man,
he didn't like me.

01:02.121 --> 01:04.715
Yeah? He liked me.

01:04.790 --> 01:10.160
That's why he gave me the job. That's
why he called me when he had to fire you.

01:10.229 --> 01:12.197
Where's your TV?

01:14.901 --> 01:17.461
- Stole.
- Stole, huh?

01:17.536 --> 01:21.097
Yeah, it's the building, man.
They're trying to get us outta here.

01:21.173 --> 01:24.040
People been getting robbed.
They turned off the water.

01:24.110 --> 01:26.374
They even stole my couch.

01:29.148 --> 01:32.311
You using, Roberto?

01:32.385 --> 01:35.479
I'm usin'. But they took the TV
and my clock radio and the couch.

01:35.554 --> 01:39.081
- Pack your stuff.
- For what?

01:39.158 --> 01:43.060
You're going into the detox. I got you
in a 60-day program at Manhattan State.

01:43.129 --> 01:45.324
- I can't do that, Jamie.
- You're going in that program.

01:45.398 --> 01:49.334
I'm trying to tell you there's something wrong
inside of me. I don't think I can ever kick.

01:49.402 --> 01:52.997
- I'm gonna lose this place.
- No, you're not. I'll keep it for you.

01:53.072 --> 01:55.165
- I'll stay here.
- What's going on here?

01:55.241 --> 01:57.436
It's family business.

01:58.678 --> 02:00.908
- Who's that slob?
- The super.

02:00.980 --> 02:04.347
He beat the crap outta me a few times.
They're tryin' to get people outta here.

02:04.417 --> 02:07.181
- Pack your things.
Put your things together.

02:09.155 --> 02:12.591
Hey! Come on! I don't like doors
being slammed in my face.

02:12.658 --> 02:15.422
Yeah? My brother told me what's
been going on in this building.

02:15.494 --> 02:18.861
Listen to what I'm sayin'. He's gonna
be gone a while, and I'm moving in.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.922
And that stuff has
just stopped happening.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.800
Listen, you little spick piece of
garbage. Don't tell me what's gonna happen.

02:24.870 --> 02:28.362
- You put your hands on me again,
and I'm gonna kick your ass!

02:28.441 --> 02:30.739
And then I'm gonna
take you to jail!

02:30.810 --> 02:32.209
Why didn't you show me that
in the first place?

02:32.278 --> 02:34.542
Gotta see a badge before
you act like a human being?

02:34.613 --> 02:38.242
Hey, kid, look.
I'm on the job too.

02:40.386 --> 02:44.152
And I think I just heard your brother
going out the bathroom window.

02:48.594 --> 02:50.789
Roberto! Hey, Roberto!

04:15.967 --> 04:17.901
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:17.969 --> 04:21.336
I was on my way to work.
I wanted to thank you for the flowers.

04:21.406 --> 04:23.374
Well, they had a special.

04:23.442 --> 04:27.640
The John Kelly Gets Used To His
Ex-wife Being A Prosecutor" special.

04:27.712 --> 04:31.113
- It's important to me to still have you for a friend.
- You got that.

04:31.183 --> 04:35.415
- I want to be able to tell you what's going on in my life.
- You got that too.

04:35.487 --> 04:39.821
We're not that far away from each other.
Maybe we can have lunch sometimes.

04:39.891 --> 04:42.985
- Well, today's not good.
- Today I can't. I'm having lunch with my boss.

04:43.061 --> 04:46.087
All right. You'll take a rain check?

04:46.164 --> 04:50.100
- Yeah.
- Go get 'em, Laurie.

04:50.168 --> 04:52.261
- See you, John.
- Go get 'em.

04:52.337 --> 04:54.430
Yeah.

04:56.107 --> 04:58.075
See ya.

05:00.479 --> 05:03.915
- Hey, Detective.
- Hey.

05:03.982 --> 05:06.246
- Hey, Kelly.
- Yeah.

05:06.318 --> 05:08.752
- You got a second?
- Sure.

05:10.555 --> 05:13.183
- You gotta help me out here.
- What's going on, Sarge?

05:13.258 --> 05:17.024
Stillwell... he's taking lunch orders
from my prisoners again.

05:17.095 --> 05:19.063
What, you think that's funny?

05:19.130 --> 05:21.394
You know what happens to these animals
when they don't get their food?

05:21.466 --> 05:24.867
- They start biting holes in each other's necks.
- Let me talk to him.

05:24.936 --> 05:27.461
Thanks.

05:29.274 --> 05:32.209
We can order anything
we want off of here?

05:32.277 --> 05:35.269
Anything. And we gotta give you
exactly what you want...

05:35.347 --> 05:39.943
within 15 minutes of normal mealtime in
order to abide by the consent decree...

05:40.018 --> 05:41.952
issued byJudge Baraka.

05:42.020 --> 05:45.876
- So what do you guys want?
- I'll have some brisket.

05:46.009 --> 05:47.977
- It's not all dried out, is it?
- Premium cut.

05:48.045 --> 05:50.570
Flash-broiled with
a little butter to order.

05:50.647 --> 05:52.842
I'll take that, medium rare,

05:52.916 --> 05:55.441
mashed potatoes,
French beans and some gravy.

05:55.519 --> 05:57.578
Good choice.
Detective Stillwell...

05:57.654 --> 06:00.418
Uh, in a minute, Kelly.
I gotta finish up here.

06:00.490 --> 06:04.085
Do you want that gravy on the meat
or on the potatoes, or both?

06:04.161 --> 06:07.494
I want it on the meat, but I don't
want it rolling in the vegetables.

06:07.564 --> 06:10.795
You want it on the side,
in a little carton.

06:10.867 --> 06:12.892
- Something like that.
- Yeah.

06:12.970 --> 06:15.438
Uh, Judge says
if you don't want dessert,

06:15.505 --> 06:17.905
you gotta so state
in front of witnesses.

06:17.975 --> 06:21.502
- No, I want dessert.
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:21.578 --> 06:25.014
Yeah, I'll, uh...
I'll catch up with him later.

06:25.082 --> 06:28.313
All right. I'm saying it nice,
Detective, but I'm saying it.

06:28.385 --> 06:31.821
Either you straighten this asshole out,
or I'm hanging him with the lieutenant.

06:31.888 --> 06:33.981
Okay, got you, Sarge.

06:36.059 --> 06:38.357
- Hey.
- Hey. What's goin' on?

06:38.428 --> 06:41.488
We gotta talk to Stillwell.
He's taking lunch orders again.

06:41.565 --> 06:44.830
Whoa. Excuse me, Kelly.
We don't gotta do anything.

06:44.901 --> 06:48.393
I've had my quota of buzzers,
dribble glasses and fart pillows.

06:48.472 --> 06:50.440
- Hey, Detective.
- Hey, Martinez.

06:50.507 --> 06:53.499
- What's goin' on, kid?
- Not much. Got a minute for me, Detective?

06:53.577 --> 06:55.670
- Yeah, sure.
- I'll catch you later.

06:55.746 --> 06:57.680
Over here.

06:59.583 --> 07:02.211
- What's up?
- A couple of things, you know.

07:02.286 --> 07:04.220
Some family stuff to deal with,

07:04.288 --> 07:07.189
plus I got a situation
in regards to another cop.

07:07.257 --> 07:09.885
- What situation?
- He's a bad cop.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.554
He's cleaning tenants out
of a rent-controlled building.

07:12.629 --> 07:15.564
He's robbing people. He's harassing 'em.
He's beatin' 'em up.

07:15.632 --> 07:19.193
- How are you involved?
- He's the super at my brother's building.

07:19.269 --> 07:21.203
I'm staying there a little while.

07:21.271 --> 07:23.398
The guy was just
in my face this morning.

07:23.473 --> 07:26.465
- And he says he's on the job?
- Yeah, after I showed him my badge.

07:26.543 --> 07:29.910
Then he gets all friendly, says don't
worry about the rent being on time.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.847
Starts talking about
throwing a few bucks my way.

07:32.916 --> 07:36.283
Whoa. I'm not gonna tell you
don't bring him up on charges,

07:36.353 --> 07:40.312
but, uh, you gotta know
this is a big step, Martinez.

07:40.390 --> 07:42.415
Yeah. I mean,

07:42.492 --> 07:45.427
I didn't join the department
to bust other cops.

07:45.495 --> 07:48.430
That's how people end up
on the rat squad.

07:50.167 --> 07:54.763
All right. You think you can talk
to this guy man-to-man? What's his name?

07:54.838 --> 07:58.740
- Hanlan. He's out of the 33...
- You think you can talk to him, straighten him out?

07:58.809 --> 08:01.039
Well, maybe I-I could try that.

08:01.111 --> 08:03.170
That oughta be your first step.

08:03.246 --> 08:05.339
Yeah.

08:05.415 --> 08:08.748
That's probably what
I oughta do. Okay.

08:08.819 --> 08:10.844
Thanks, Detective.

08:10.921 --> 08:14.357
- You moved into your brother's place?
- Yeah, I might do that.

08:14.424 --> 08:16.915
- You never told me what he does.
- Roberto?

08:16.993 --> 08:19.086
- Yeah.
- He's still feeling his way along.

08:19.162 --> 08:21.323
Still looking for his niche.

08:21.398 --> 08:24.595
Hey, keep me posted
on this other situation.

08:24.668 --> 08:27.762
- Will do. Thanks for the advice.
- Yeah.

08:30.374 --> 08:33.138
Yo, Kelly. What do you need?

08:33.210 --> 08:35.474
- You got plans for lunch?
- I can be had.

08:35.544 --> 08:39.845
- Andy and I wanna take you out.
- It's a date.

08:42.652 --> 08:45.485
What are you trying
to prove here, John?

08:45.555 --> 08:47.546
You're not going to raise
this guy over again.

08:47.624 --> 08:51.583
- You don't think his stuff is starting to get weirder?
- I don't keep real close tabs.

08:51.661 --> 08:55.995
I mean, Stillwell wants to be a practical
joker, lose his paycheck gambling,

08:56.066 --> 08:58.967
- that's why they fought the Revolutionary War.
- Hey, guys.

08:59.035 --> 09:03.165
You think preseason
pro basketball's a sucker's bet?

09:03.240 --> 09:05.936
I don't follow it that closely.
We ordered.

09:06.009 --> 09:09.877
I gave mine in the back.
Andy, what are you doing there?

09:09.946 --> 09:12.414
- What?
- We can't take you anywhere. Whoop.

09:12.482 --> 09:16.248
So what's the occasion?

09:16.319 --> 09:19.117
It's probably a good idea to stop taking
lunch orders for the holding cell.

09:19.189 --> 09:21.919
- Wait a second. You don't think that's funny?
- Yeah.

09:21.992 --> 09:24.927
- I think you've had a good run with it.
- Well, if you think about it,

09:24.995 --> 09:28.260
you're really asking the sarge
to clean up the mess afterward.

09:28.331 --> 09:31.198
All right. That's a point.
I'll make it right with the sarge.

09:31.268 --> 09:33.828
I'll lighten up on it. Wait.

09:33.904 --> 09:36.304
- Earn your tip. Jets get seven at the Bills.
- The Bills.

09:36.373 --> 09:39.433
- You're nuts. Jets win on the field.
- Oh, the Bills cover.

09:39.509 --> 09:41.807
Go back to mah-jongg, you hump!

09:41.878 --> 09:45.678
He always unties my shoelaces.

09:45.749 --> 09:49.207
So, uh, how's your love lives?
Or wait.

09:49.286 --> 09:51.049
- You done rebuking me?
- That's it.

09:51.121 --> 09:53.487
- Love life's a little slow.
- Ditto.

09:53.557 --> 09:58.119
- How's Lila?
- Good. We got a little rocky patch coming up.

09:58.195 --> 10:00.686
- Is that right?
- I took out a loan...

10:00.764 --> 10:03.494
on our pension on some real estate
thing in New Mexico.

10:03.567 --> 10:07.560
Turned out to be bogus.
She doesn't know about it yet.

10:07.637 --> 10:10.731
I don't plan any big sexfest...

10:10.807 --> 10:13.367
- the night we have that little talk.
- How bad was the hit?

10:13.443 --> 10:18.073
- I'd say, uh, all of it. Pretty much all.
- That's rough, Art.

10:18.148 --> 10:22.175
Ah, balls. All's I need's
a 12-team parlay, and I'm square.

10:23.420 --> 10:25.388
Andy, what are they doing?

10:25.455 --> 10:28.856
# Happy birthday to you #

10:28.925 --> 10:32.088
- Is this some special day and you didn't tell us?
- #Happy birthday #

10:32.162 --> 10:35.029
# To you #

10:35.098 --> 10:39.125
# Happy birthday
dear Detective #

10:39.202 --> 10:42.569
It's not really my birthday.
He's just having some fun with me.

10:42.639 --> 10:46.541
#Happy birthday to you ##

10:46.610 --> 10:49.738
We gotta get outta here now.

10:49.813 --> 10:52.873
Funny, Artie, funnier
than the last six times.

10:56.152 --> 10:58.950
Happy birthday to you.

11:12.202 --> 11:15.569
You think the old man could've had
a heart attack or a stroke?

11:15.639 --> 11:19.700
Sure, before or after
he fell through the railing?

11:19.776 --> 11:21.744
Let's go.

11:23.980 --> 11:26.608
- Watch your step.
- I told you, Detective.

11:26.683 --> 11:30.050
- I told you this Hanlan was a bad guy.
- Take it easy, Martinez.

11:30.120 --> 11:33.180
That old man kept an eye out
on my brother. He looked out for him.

11:33.256 --> 11:36.521
It's an old building. I guess the
railing could've loosened on its own,

11:36.593 --> 11:39.858
but there's some fresh screwdriver marks
where the brackets were.

11:39.930 --> 11:42.694
The lady over here says
that Mrs. Vicario in 207...

11:42.766 --> 11:45.200
suffocated three months ago
from the gas in her stove.

11:45.268 --> 11:48.101
Says that the windows in her apartment
were shut in the middle ofJuly.

11:48.171 --> 11:50.105
She thinks the super did that too.

11:50.173 --> 11:53.665
- Did she have any run-ins with him
personally? - No. I asked her that.

11:53.743 --> 11:56.837
- Is your brother around?
- No, not right now.

11:56.913 --> 11:59.404
No point in dustin'.
Guy's the super.

11:59.482 --> 12:02.246
Fingerprints on the banister
wouldn't prove anything anyway.

12:02.319 --> 12:04.651
I called Hanlan's precinct.
He's doin' a 4-to-12.

12:04.721 --> 12:07.918
I don't wanna talk to him on the job, so
we'll talk to him tomorrow. All right?

12:07.991 --> 12:11.427
He did this. I'm telling you,
he did this. He's a bad guy!

12:11.494 --> 12:14.930
I hear you, Martinez, and we're gonna
do something about it. Come on.

12:31.247 --> 12:33.579
- Laura! Hey.
- Hey.

12:35.352 --> 12:38.515
- Sorry I had to cancel lunch yesterday, but...
- No problem.

12:38.588 --> 12:42.684
- Hey, just like law school... junk food on the fly.
- Yeah.

12:42.759 --> 12:46.092
- So are you all settled in? You got your boxes unpacked?
- Pretty much.

12:46.162 --> 12:48.687
The assistant D.A.'s area
is a little like Kafka, no?

12:48.765 --> 12:51.097
Yeah, my office is
in kind of a long row.

12:51.167 --> 12:55.399
So the group of cases I'm working started
with a couple of street-level drug dealers.

12:55.472 --> 12:58.032
They keep going down
like dominoes, I keep going up.

12:58.108 --> 13:00.838
I'm not two convictions away
from being the top...

13:00.910 --> 13:02.901
narcotics prosecutor
in the five boroughs,

13:02.979 --> 13:06.676
which means I got 47 other prosecutors
who would love to see me fall on my face.

13:06.750 --> 13:09.218
I want you to keep me
from doing that.

13:09.285 --> 13:11.219
I'm second seat
interviewing witnesses.

13:11.287 --> 13:13.585
You'll pick it right up.
You were always smarter than I was.

13:13.657 --> 13:17.024
Once you get used to the dirty water,
you are going to love the work.

13:17.093 --> 13:20.392
- I can get used to dirty water.
- You see that?

13:20.463 --> 13:23.557
That is U.S. Attorney Goldfarb.

13:23.633 --> 13:26.158
He controls a witness we need.
We're pitching him tomorrow.

13:26.236 --> 13:31.003
In my larcenous heart, I'd like to buy
him a box of those $ 10 torches he smokes.

13:31.074 --> 13:34.566
My advice would be:
Don't do that.

13:34.644 --> 13:37.169
See? You're gonna be essential.

13:46.456 --> 13:48.617
- You John Kelly?
- Yeah.

13:48.692 --> 13:50.853
- Jack Hanlan.
- Hey, Jack. Thanks for comin' in.

13:50.927 --> 13:52.918
- Andy Sipowicz, Jack Hanlan.
- How you doin'?

13:52.996 --> 13:54.930
Come over here, Jack.

13:56.733 --> 13:59.930
- You want coffee, Jack?
- No. No, thanks.

14:00.003 --> 14:03.530
I knew a John Kelly with the 25
when I was coming up.

14:03.606 --> 14:06.598
- That would've been my father.
- And you can be proud of that.

14:06.676 --> 14:09.770
He was a warrior, your old man.
A real old-time bull.

14:09.846 --> 14:12.337
Stand-up all the way.

14:12.415 --> 14:16.181
So you're, uh, working as a super in this
building where the old man died yesterday?

14:16.252 --> 14:20.552
Yeah. God, you must've been
just a kid when your dad passed.

14:20.623 --> 14:23.353
I was 11.

14:23.426 --> 14:26.953
We'll not see his like again soon.

14:27.030 --> 14:30.466
Well, what was it you wanted
to know about the accident, John?

14:30.533 --> 14:34.401
- We looked for you at the building.
- I was working the night tour.

14:34.471 --> 14:38.430
I felt horrible about the old guy
falling through the railing.

14:38.508 --> 14:40.442
Any other problems
at that building?

14:40.510 --> 14:43.377
The usual... a few break-ins,

14:43.446 --> 14:45.812
junkies robbing pensioners
on check day.

14:45.882 --> 14:48.646
I smack 'em around a little bit
just to keep 'em in line.

14:48.718 --> 14:52.415
Aside from some vandalism,
uh, there hasn't been much else.

14:52.489 --> 14:55.083
Well, we heard the landlord
wants the tenants out.

14:55.158 --> 14:58.389
Sure. And he doesn't
waste money on improvements.

14:58.461 --> 15:01.089
But I keep things running
at a basic level.

15:01.164 --> 15:03.257
People move out gradually.

15:03.333 --> 15:07.133
We don't have Dobermans
in the hallways at night or anything.

15:07.203 --> 15:09.137
We heard complaints about conditions.

15:09.205 --> 15:12.333
Would you like to see my to-do list?

15:12.408 --> 15:14.342
It's hell keeping up,
especially the boiler.

15:14.410 --> 15:16.571
That boiler is a bastard.

15:18.815 --> 15:22.581
How about your boiler, Sipowicz? I heard
you took a few shots not long ago.

15:22.652 --> 15:24.586
I get up and down the stairs.

15:26.656 --> 15:29.250
Yeah, these young guys today.

15:29.325 --> 15:31.919
They take a whack like that,
it's instant disability retirement.

15:31.995 --> 15:35.021
Then they spend the rest of
their lives telling everybody...

15:35.098 --> 15:38.124
what a great hero they are,
like this kid from here I met...

15:38.201 --> 15:40.635
Martinez.

15:40.703 --> 15:42.728
Yeah, yeah,
some name like that.

15:42.806 --> 15:45.741
His brother lives
in the building.

15:45.809 --> 15:49.108
He's one of the junkies I was telling
you about. We had a little run-in.

15:54.250 --> 15:58.516
- Well, uh, anything else I can tell you?
- That's about it.

16:00.423 --> 16:03.551
Okeydoke, then.
Oh, if you got a free night, Kelly,

16:03.626 --> 16:05.890
let's have a beer.

16:05.962 --> 16:09.227
I'll tell you a few stories about
your old man your mother doesn't know.

16:09.299 --> 16:11.529
Thanks for the offer.

16:11.601 --> 16:14.536
Sure, anytime.
Keep the wind at your back.

16:18.842 --> 16:20.810
What do you think?

16:20.877 --> 16:24.540
What do you mean, what do I think? This
Iyin' donkey scumbag son of a bitch.

16:24.614 --> 16:27.583
You don't figure your old man
and him would've been runnin' buddies?

16:27.650 --> 16:30.881
- My old man wouldn't stand at the same bar with this guy.
- You think he croaked this guy?

16:30.954 --> 16:34.082
You know he did.
And he's gonna walk on it, isn't he?

16:35.725 --> 16:38.421
Come on. We'll run it
for the lieutenant.

16:42.465 --> 16:45.059
Joselito, if you see him,
would you call me up?

16:45.134 --> 16:47.500
Please, all right?
It's real important.

16:49.639 --> 16:51.573
What are you doing here?

16:51.641 --> 16:55.338
Because I want my eyes on you
when I ask you what's going on.

16:55.411 --> 16:58.710
Now, you know your cousin Rosa's kid's
being christened on Sunday?

16:58.781 --> 17:01.272
- Yeah, I'm gonna be there.
- What about your brother?

17:02.785 --> 17:05.652
- I don't know if he can make it.
- I called his place of work.

17:05.722 --> 17:09.419
- They say he's not there anymore.
- The job and him, it wasn't a fit.

17:09.492 --> 17:12.586
- I told you, I'm watching you.
- And I'm telling you the truth.

17:12.662 --> 17:15.096
You move out of the house.
You're living at his place.

17:15.164 --> 17:18.190
Your mother's worried, which is
getting to me. What's going on?

17:18.268 --> 17:20.065
I don't know. I'm not sure.

17:20.136 --> 17:22.627
He's your little brother.
You're supposed to take care of him.

17:22.704 --> 17:25.070
I know! I'm trying!

17:27.542 --> 17:29.602
Come here. Come here.

17:29.679 --> 17:31.613
Come here.

17:31.681 --> 17:34.343
If this wasn't your place of work
and your boss over there...

17:34.417 --> 17:36.351
and these other people here,

17:36.419 --> 17:39.013
I'd stand you up against the wall
and knock the crap outta you.

17:39.088 --> 17:42.683
- He's your little brother.
- I'm trying to take care of him.

17:42.759 --> 17:45.694
Now, you tell Mama
he's gonna be all right.

17:47.163 --> 17:49.597
Papi, this is
DetectiveJohn Kelly.

17:49.666 --> 17:51.998
- This is my father Hector.
- Nice to meet you.

17:52.068 --> 17:54.662
Likewise.

17:54.737 --> 17:57.399
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

17:58.875 --> 18:02.902
Got a christening on Sunday.
He gets all worked up.

18:02.979 --> 18:05.413
- Lieutenant wants to see you.
- All right.

18:07.650 --> 18:09.982
Yeah, I'll call you right back.

18:11.921 --> 18:14.822
You asked to be kept apprised on this
incident at your brother's building.

18:14.891 --> 18:18.952
- Yes, sir.
- Well, Kelly and Sipowicz both think you're right.

18:19.028 --> 18:21.087
The cop who's the super is no good.

18:21.164 --> 18:24.998
They both think he's probably responsible
for what happened to that old man,

18:25.068 --> 18:27.002
but he's covered.

18:27.070 --> 18:29.470
There's no witnesses,
no conclusive physical evidence.

18:29.539 --> 18:33.498
- Then I want to go forward on the other stuff.
- What do you mean?

18:33.576 --> 18:36.511
I want to notify Internal Affairs
on what this guy's been doing...

18:36.579 --> 18:39.514
the bribe he offered me,
how he beat my brother.

18:39.582 --> 18:42.073
You sure you want to do this?

18:42.151 --> 18:44.813
Yeah. I know this is a big step.

18:44.887 --> 18:48.550
Detective Kelly and I talked
about it before. I want to do it.

18:50.293 --> 18:53.228
Uh, I...

18:53.296 --> 18:56.697
I know a guy in I.A.D.
Let me reach out to him.

19:29.632 --> 19:31.648
DetectiveJohn Kelly.

19:31.781 --> 19:35.239
I called your office.
They said you still come out here.

19:35.318 --> 19:38.685
Give myself a recital here three,
four times a week.

19:40.290 --> 19:43.020
How you doin', Kevin?
How's Karen?

19:43.093 --> 19:47.052
She got a little gray, few lines
around her eyes. I like it.

19:47.130 --> 19:49.394
- Kids?
- Eh.

19:49.466 --> 19:53.926
Terry's, uh, going to St. Malachi's
now, doing good. Brian's 14.

19:54.004 --> 19:58.441
All he can think about is just what
you'd expect him to, plus football.

20:00.944 --> 20:03.435
- What happened with you?
- You remember Laurie?

20:03.513 --> 20:06.414
- Yeah.
- The girl I was seeing? Yeah, I married her.

20:06.483 --> 20:09.008
Is that so? I liked her.

20:09.085 --> 20:13.419
Yeah, we, uh... we split up
a couple of months ago. You know.

20:13.490 --> 20:16.459
Sorry to hear it.

20:16.526 --> 20:19.017
So, John,

20:19.095 --> 20:23.259
you here to renew our big friendship,
or... did you maybe want something?

20:37.380 --> 20:39.314
We got a bad cop, Kevin.

20:39.382 --> 20:42.749
Ayoung guy I work with,
James Martinez, wants to bust him.

20:42.819 --> 20:46.050
- I was hoping you could handle the case.
- That's what I do.

20:46.122 --> 20:49.114
He's going to get a lot of exposure
when you guys make the collar.

20:49.192 --> 20:53.526
So you want to know
can we keep him low-profile...

20:53.596 --> 20:56.360
so he doesn't spend the rest of
his career quarantined in I.A. D...

20:56.433 --> 20:59.527
with a bunch of craphouse rats
and snitches such as myself?

20:59.602 --> 21:02.469
- I never passed judgment on you.
- Yeah. Look how close we stayed.

21:02.539 --> 21:06.168
That was you.
You put in for I.A.D.

21:06.242 --> 21:08.142
And you weren't more comfortable
with that, right?

21:08.211 --> 21:10.111
For having to hang around with a cop
who popped a fellow officer.

21:10.180 --> 21:13.547
Didn't you do what you thought
was right? Didn't you?

21:13.616 --> 21:17.279
You're damn right!
And I'd do the same thing today.

21:17.353 --> 21:19.787
I know that.

21:19.856 --> 21:22.586
I didn't come out here
to dig all this up again.

21:23.893 --> 21:27.158
You want to know can I help
your friend Martinez.

21:31.067 --> 21:34.366
I can keep his name out
of the papers until the trial.

21:34.437 --> 21:37.998
Then if this bad cop pleads out, Martinez'
name may not get published at all.

21:38.074 --> 21:40.167
I'd appreciate that.

21:43.179 --> 21:46.114
Then no one would know
what he did except, of course,

21:46.182 --> 21:49.117
everyone in the department
this bad cop talks to.

21:49.185 --> 21:53.053
And tells them how this lousy
rat snitch spick Martinez...

21:53.123 --> 21:56.092
out of the 15 Precinct
set him up.

22:00.430 --> 22:02.364
Excuse me, Kelly.

22:28.324 --> 22:31.350
I have two dead heroin dealers,
the Colon brothers,

22:31.427 --> 22:33.827
both taken out by Agosto Reyes.

22:33.897 --> 22:38.163
This Reyes put $100,000 worth
of smack on the street every month.

22:38.234 --> 22:40.828
Your protected witness
was his supplier.

22:40.904 --> 22:43.930
For security purposes,
we're calling our witness the Roach.

22:44.007 --> 22:46.999
- The Roach?
- Yes.

22:47.076 --> 22:49.442
This guy I'm trying
to put away, Reyes,

22:49.512 --> 22:54.074
probably had conversations with
the Roach regarding these murders.

22:54.150 --> 22:56.311
Everybody's asking
for the Roach...

22:56.386 --> 22:58.946
Hartford, Atlantic City, everybody.

22:59.022 --> 23:01.582
How essential is the Roach's
testimony to your case?

23:01.658 --> 23:04.149
It would make it bulletproof.

23:04.227 --> 23:08.926
We'd only need a couple days' interrogation
and prep, then maybe one day of testimony.

23:08.998 --> 23:13.332
We're prepared to be fully flexible
regarding any of the demands on his time.

23:13.403 --> 23:16.065
That's a precondition
of access to this witness.

23:16.139 --> 23:19.302
I'll also see that the U.S. Attorney's
office is lavishly credited...

23:19.375 --> 23:21.775
for facilitating this prosecution.

23:21.844 --> 23:24.779
Thanks for the kiss, but what
you just offered so generously,

23:24.847 --> 23:28.374
that's also a precondition
of access to this witness.

23:28.451 --> 23:31.943
Would you mind waiting
outside a minute, please?

23:34.324 --> 23:37.816
It looks like it's just finishing up...

23:39.896 --> 23:42.330
So how do you think I did in there?

23:42.398 --> 23:45.925
You were good.
You don't think so?

23:46.002 --> 23:48.493
If we get the Roach, I think so.

23:48.571 --> 23:51.836
Can you tell me who gave him
the stupid code name like the Roach?

23:51.908 --> 23:54.342
I did.

23:54.410 --> 23:57.846
If you'll step back in,
we can start working out your access.

24:04.921 --> 24:07.515
- Here's the 1606. Take these back, all right?
- Sure, Sarge.

24:07.590 --> 24:11.185
I just missed the Brooklyn
number 427. I had 815.

24:11.261 --> 24:15.857
- What do you want, Stillwell?
- Sarge, I owe you an apology.

24:15.932 --> 24:19.368
Uh, I went a little overboard
on that food gag,

24:19.435 --> 24:23.201
and I just want to say it's finito.
End of story.

24:23.273 --> 24:26.606
Yeah? Well, I was this near
to taking you to the lieutenant.

24:26.676 --> 24:30.339
And I appreciate
that you didn't. Square?

24:30.413 --> 24:32.347
Yeah, sure.

24:32.415 --> 24:34.679
Thanks, Sarge.

24:37.186 --> 24:40.678
Do you have anyone who can corroborate
the incidents you've alleged?

24:40.757 --> 24:43.191
One 80-year-old guy
who could have done it is dead.

24:43.259 --> 24:46.092
You said your brother was
also a victim of harassment.

24:46.162 --> 24:49.188
- Would he be available to give a statement?
- Eventually, yeah.

24:49.265 --> 24:54.225
- What does that mean?
- Well, he's not available. I'm not sure where he is.

24:54.304 --> 24:57.705
We have no case unless we
can get Hanlan on record.

24:57.774 --> 25:00.868
- How do you feel about wearing a wire?
- I don't want to.

25:00.943 --> 25:03.104
Then we can't proceed.

25:03.179 --> 25:06.580
I said I don't want to.
I didn't say I wouldn't.

25:08.184 --> 25:12.120
This guy made an old man die.
He probably killed an old woman too.

25:12.188 --> 25:15.954
He abused my brother.
I don't want to, but...

25:16.025 --> 25:20.394
if it takes wearing a wire to pop
this guy, then that's what I'm gonna do.

25:34.877 --> 25:37.812
Oh, man, that's the gear.
They're gonna put a wire on the kid.

25:37.880 --> 25:41.111
- This is no good.
- He's a big boy, John.

25:41.184 --> 25:44.620
Mm-mm, no good.

25:53.796 --> 25:57.857
- How about we hold off on this? Let me talk to the guy.
- This isn't your problem.

25:57.934 --> 26:00.903
Martinez, Hanlan wants to drink
with me, piss in my ear a little.

26:00.970 --> 26:04.098
- Maybe I can get him to talk about the old man.
- Will you wear a wire?

26:04.173 --> 26:07.267
No. But if I can get him
to cop to the crime,

26:07.343 --> 26:10.938
maybe I can figure out a way
to make it stand up in court.

26:11.013 --> 26:12.947
Do it.

26:24.193 --> 26:27.993
- You don't have to go on this.
- You're not planning to kill this guy, are you?

26:28.064 --> 26:31.830
- No.
- Who's driving?

26:31.901 --> 26:35.962
Hey, Sipowicz, Kelly, check this out.
It'll just take a second.

26:36.038 --> 26:38.529
You gotta hear this.
Go on, pal.

26:38.608 --> 26:41.202
Tell these detectives
what you just told me.

26:41.277 --> 26:44.440
Well, uh, I was waiting
at a bus stop...

26:44.514 --> 26:48.006
when these two women
offered me a lift home.

26:48.084 --> 26:50.985
They were young,
attractive, very friendly,

26:51.053 --> 26:53.647
- so naturally I accepted.
- Go on. Then what?

26:55.224 --> 26:58.159
They drove down
under the Westside Highway,

26:58.227 --> 27:00.821
and they parked there and...

27:00.897 --> 27:03.832
ordered me to remove
my clothes at gunpoint.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.494
At gunpoint. You're not gonna
believe this. Tell 'em.

27:06.569 --> 27:08.833
I was humiliated.

27:08.905 --> 27:13.001
They forced me to...
you know, pleasure one of them.

27:13.075 --> 27:15.202
And? And, and?

27:16.345 --> 27:19.906
I experienced...
an unwanted emission.

27:19.982 --> 27:22.177
This being the first
of several unwanted emissions...

27:22.251 --> 27:25.778
intimidated out of this...
this rampant bull of a man.

27:25.855 --> 27:29.791
Don't you think you ought to take this
kind of complaint in the interview room?

27:29.859 --> 27:32.953
The interview room? Nobody'd believe me
if I came out with a story like this.

27:33.029 --> 27:34.963
- Skip to the next emission.
- Do I have to?

27:35.031 --> 27:36.965
Yeah, you have to.

27:37.033 --> 27:42.699
Okay, so now the other one orders me to
do the same to her... the sexual thing.

27:42.772 --> 27:46.208
- And he's coerced out of yet another emission.
- Uh, we gotta go.

27:46.275 --> 27:50.143
Do you believe this guy? He's got so many
emissions, he's gonna need a smog certificate!

27:50.213 --> 27:54.775
You bagger! You're 60! Your butt
hangs down the back of your knees!

27:54.851 --> 27:57.615
You oughta throw yourself
on the floor and thank God...

27:57.687 --> 27:59.712
you can make up
stories like this!

27:59.789 --> 28:03.088
- I'm not gonna take this! I'm getting outta here!
- Hey! Wait a second.

28:03.159 --> 28:05.719
- Hey, Art.
- Where you going?

28:05.795 --> 28:09.754
Hey, hey! I want you to show these cops
the abused organ in question!

28:09.832 --> 28:14.565
Come back here and lay out that
awesome wood right here on my desk!

28:25.047 --> 28:27.538
You should see your guys'...

28:27.617 --> 28:30.814
If this isn't the Last Supper...

28:30.887 --> 28:33.412
Hey! Hey, it's a joke.
I hired the guy.

28:33.489 --> 28:36.185
Oh, you should see your faces.

28:39.061 --> 28:41.529
My last 180 bucks!

28:41.597 --> 28:44.191
I cleaned out the account,
but it was worth it!

28:44.267 --> 28:46.929
Oh, I lost urine,
it was so funny!

28:47.003 --> 28:50.803
I'm tellin' ya, I gotta go
change my shorts. Whoo!

28:50.873 --> 28:53.171
Art. Art. Art.

28:53.242 --> 28:55.005
Hey. Hey.

28:55.077 --> 28:57.511
- How's it goin', Lieutenant?
- It's okay. How you doin'?

28:57.580 --> 28:59.514
- Fine.
- You wanna step in my office?

28:59.582 --> 29:01.948
- Hey, Lieutenant...
- No, come on, come on.

29:02.018 --> 29:04.612
Come on, Lieutenant.
Just having some fun here.

29:04.687 --> 29:07.281
That isn't what I saw, Art.

29:07.356 --> 29:10.689
W... Well, you think it got
a little too out of line?

29:10.760 --> 29:14.696
Art, I want you to give me your gun.

29:14.764 --> 29:17.858
What are you talking about? Why?

29:17.934 --> 29:21.165
Because I think it's a good idea.

29:21.237 --> 29:24.570
Why? You gonna take me
to the puzzle house?

29:24.640 --> 29:27.165
- Gonna take me to Psych Services?
- That's right.

29:28.411 --> 29:30.504
Come on. Lieutenant.

29:30.580 --> 29:33.140
Come on, Art.
Give me the gun.

29:38.821 --> 29:42.416
Eh... Eh...

29:43.593 --> 29:46.460
We're off to see the wizard.

30:10.386 --> 30:12.377
Hanlan, you in there?

30:12.455 --> 30:15.185
- Who needs me?
- It's John Kelly, Jack.

30:15.257 --> 30:18.055
I called your precinct.
They said you were off.

30:18.127 --> 30:21.722
Figured maybe you'd find me here, huh?
Excellent police work.

30:21.797 --> 30:24.891
- Can I offer you a little liquor drink?
- Sure.

30:24.967 --> 30:27.629
Come on in.

30:28.804 --> 30:31.068
What are you looking for, John?

30:31.140 --> 30:33.574
You want to hear about your father?

30:33.643 --> 30:35.577
I'd like that.

30:35.645 --> 30:40.014
Well, he might have made chief
of detectives if he hadn't got shot.

30:40.082 --> 30:43.142
You wanna know why?
Because he knew the job.

30:44.553 --> 30:48.284
Not the manual, the job.
Sit down.

30:49.759 --> 30:53.251
Back then, we had an Irish department.
We had some guineas.

30:53.329 --> 30:55.991
We had Jews. We had a few niggers,
but it was an Irish department.

30:56.065 --> 31:00.695
And this city was liveable. Harlem, before
the '64 riots, you could walk down the street.

31:00.770 --> 31:03.568
You could do your shopping. You could
talk to the spades like people.

31:03.639 --> 31:06.904
They even treated each other
like human beings.

31:06.976 --> 31:10.912
You're a young guy, Kelly.
You grew up in a different department...

31:10.980 --> 31:13.642
in a different city.

31:13.716 --> 31:16.014
You probably think I'm a racist.

31:16.085 --> 31:18.918
I think you're a lousy bartender.

31:18.988 --> 31:23.357
I'm trying to paint
a picture for you of this city,

31:23.426 --> 31:27.226
the department
your old man was part of.

31:27.296 --> 31:31.665
He, uh... he set a standard for himself
and for the people on the street.

31:31.734 --> 31:36.034
Every scumbag criminal out there
knew there was a line.

31:36.105 --> 31:39.302
And if he crossed it, he was in trouble.
Not too many crossed it.

31:39.375 --> 31:42.401
And if they did,
they never did it twice.

31:42.478 --> 31:45.038
How did it feel
living in the perfect society?

31:45.114 --> 31:47.981
It's all right. Joke around.

31:48.050 --> 31:52.248
But if some skell raped an old lady,
he might find himself thrown off a roof.

31:52.321 --> 31:54.983
That was called
officer discretion back then.

31:55.057 --> 31:58.356
My old man ever throw
anybody off a building?

31:58.427 --> 32:01.794
I wouldn't know. That's not
the point that I'm trying to make.

32:03.032 --> 32:05.865
What was it like
to work with him?

32:05.935 --> 32:09.462
I only saw him at the crime scenes.
We never worked one-on-one.

32:09.538 --> 32:11.529
I was on patrol.
He was a detective.

32:11.607 --> 32:14.371
But everybody knew
what kind of a guy he was.

32:14.443 --> 32:16.809
I thought you were buddies.

32:16.879 --> 32:20.975
I said I knew him.
We all knew him.

32:21.050 --> 32:24.383
We knew we could count
on each other.

32:28.591 --> 32:32.493
- I got a problem, and I don't
know what to do about it.

32:32.561 --> 32:34.893
What do you mean?

32:34.964 --> 32:37.330
I think you did something
to the old man upstairs.

32:37.399 --> 32:40.596
What are you talking about?
That old guy fell. That was an accident.

32:40.669 --> 32:43.103
Nails were pulled,
fresh screwdriver marks.

32:43.172 --> 32:46.107
Your prints were all over that banister.
That's a makable case.

32:46.175 --> 32:48.109
You're a better detective than that.

32:48.177 --> 32:51.112
If they lifted one print
off that banister, they lifted 50.

32:51.180 --> 32:54.377
Other tenants described
a pattern of harassment.

32:54.450 --> 32:57.681
The old man is dead.
What am I gonna do about this?

32:57.753 --> 33:01.780
You wanna know what you can do? Have another
drink, go home and put it out of your mind.

33:01.857 --> 33:04.382
I can't do that.
I know what I know.

33:04.460 --> 33:08.089
What is this, Kelly? Is this a shakedown?
You want money to make this go away?

33:08.164 --> 33:11.725
- You offering me money?
- For what? I haven't done anything wrong!

33:22.044 --> 33:25.104
- What kind of money are we talking about?
- How much is it worth to you?

33:26.615 --> 33:29.209
Well, I think I can see
my way clear...

33:29.285 --> 33:31.446
to a thousand dollars,
something like that.

33:31.520 --> 33:34.887
- You did it, didn't ya?
- I did nothin'! The old man fell!

33:34.957 --> 33:37.391
Nobody feels worse
about it than I do!

33:37.459 --> 33:40.895
You didn't do it, but you're
offering me a thousand dollars.

33:40.963 --> 33:43.397
You can make this thing go away.

33:43.465 --> 33:46.400
I can't change what happened.
I wish I could.

33:46.468 --> 33:49.631
- It makes me... sick. It keeps me awake.
- It should.

33:49.705 --> 33:53.664
No! You don't get to point
your finger at me!

33:53.742 --> 33:57.439
You don't get to judge another
man's life, or what he had to do!

33:57.513 --> 33:59.393
- We're talking about pushing an old man through a railing.
- He wasn't pushed! He fell!

33:59.394 --> 34:01.273
- We're talking about pushing an old man through a railing.
- He wasn't pushed! He fell!

34:01.346 --> 34:05.248
- You loosened it. - L-I do
what I have to do to make a life!

34:05.317 --> 34:08.013
And an old man had to die
over it? Jack, come on.

34:08.085 --> 34:10.646
This is John Kelly's son.
Make me understand.

34:10.722 --> 34:14.418
Look, I'm 56 years old!
Nobody's looking out for me!

34:14.493 --> 34:18.360
These people here, they give me $600
under the table and a place to stay!

34:18.429 --> 34:22.992
- That doesn't let you off the hook.
- What do you want, 2,500?

34:23.068 --> 34:25.730
- I want you to tell me you did it.
- All right!

34:25.804 --> 34:28.500
I pulled nails!
I loosened the banister!

34:30.074 --> 34:34.034
And if it ever gets back to me,
I'll deny I ever said it.

34:34.112 --> 34:37.047
Ah, nobody wanted
the old guy to die.

34:37.114 --> 34:41.279
Nobody... Nobody feels worse
about it than me.

34:48.059 --> 34:49.993
Are we all right now?

34:59.871 --> 35:01.839
Yeah.

35:03.008 --> 35:06.535
Give me a day to get the money.

35:06.611 --> 35:10.308
Forget the money.
It's not about the money.

35:12.250 --> 35:15.219
I know this is a lot
for you to bury,

35:15.287 --> 35:19.917
but in my heart I know I would do the
same thing for you, John Kelly's son.

35:22.694 --> 35:25.128
Your hand, John?

35:29.835 --> 35:31.928
That's it.

35:33.438 --> 35:36.464
You did the right thing.
Your old man would be proud of ya.

35:36.541 --> 35:39.738
- He would've understood.
- I think he would.

35:39.811 --> 35:42.211
I know he would.

35:43.415 --> 35:45.975
I know he would!

36:01.233 --> 36:03.326
How'd you do?

36:03.401 --> 36:06.893
Got him. Take me home before I puke.

36:22.454 --> 36:26.550
Hey, Kelly! When are you
goin'over to these guys?

36:26.625 --> 36:29.788
When are you gonna find
your right home at I.A. D?

36:29.861 --> 36:33.524
At least they admit they're snitches.
They don't sit and drink with you...

36:33.598 --> 36:35.395
and then rat on you!

36:35.467 --> 36:37.799
You're a lousy stool pigeon,
a convent snitch,

36:37.869 --> 36:40.394
and you pissed all over
your father's gravestone!

36:40.472 --> 36:43.066
Don't mention my father's name again,
you murdering son of a bitch.

36:43.141 --> 36:45.769
- This would make him sick!
- Shut up, Hanlan.

36:45.844 --> 36:48.369
Get him upstairs.

36:48.446 --> 36:50.744
Everybody in the department's
gotta know...

36:50.815 --> 36:53.909
what a pissy little
schoolgirl you are!

36:53.985 --> 36:56.351
Get up those stairs, Hanlan.
You're making a fool of yourself.

36:56.421 --> 36:58.787
We'll see who's the fool, Kelly!

37:03.728 --> 37:06.219
I gotta see some paperwork.

37:06.298 --> 37:08.232
All right. All right.

37:08.300 --> 37:10.131
Alphonse Giardella?

37:10.201 --> 37:13.102
I'm James Craig.
This is Laura Michaels.

37:13.171 --> 37:15.264
Mr. Craig, Ms. Michaels.

37:15.340 --> 37:17.672
I arranged for
some refreshments.

37:17.742 --> 37:21.838
Oysters. Very sensual.

37:21.913 --> 37:25.280
You spilled some juice on your shirt.

37:25.350 --> 37:28.342
Oh. I'm nuts.

37:28.420 --> 37:31.321
I knew I should've had
the fried calamari. I'm sorry.

37:31.389 --> 37:33.550
Sit down. Sit down.

37:33.625 --> 37:38.460
I'll be right with you.
I just gotta make a quick change.

37:38.530 --> 37:43.490
Punks, weaklings, ass bandits...
they all worship success.

37:43.568 --> 37:47.265
But something else, Mr. Craig...
they root for failure.

37:47.339 --> 37:49.933
Figure it out, huh?
I guess you know.

37:50.008 --> 37:52.374
You got a lot of people
on your own side rooting for you.

37:52.444 --> 37:55.538
- Well, I'm gonna win my cases.
- He's got a screw you" attitude,

37:55.614 --> 37:57.707
your boss, just like me.

37:57.782 --> 38:02.276
I want you to start with your relationship
with the Dominican, Agosto Reyes.

38:02.354 --> 38:04.720
I don't have relationships
with knuckle bouncers.

38:04.789 --> 38:08.350
I dealt some smack
to the 'yom is all.

38:08.426 --> 38:11.691
He used maybe four keys a month,
maybe three, four percent of my pie.

38:11.763 --> 38:15.255
He ever mentioned his dealings
with Jesus and Rigoberto Colon to you?

38:15.333 --> 38:19.235
One month he picks up his four keys,
comes back four days later.

38:19.304 --> 38:22.171
I say, Nice work, Reyes.
Quick turnaround."

38:22.240 --> 38:25.334
Reyes tells me
it's not like that at all.

38:25.410 --> 38:28.573
He says he fronted these Colon brothers
the whole four keys,

38:28.647 --> 38:31.582
and they come back with a story
about being ripped off.

38:31.650 --> 38:34.210
At this point
Agosto Reyes tells me...

38:34.285 --> 38:36.617
He becomes very indignant
on my behalf.

38:36.688 --> 38:39.122
He says, I whacked both
those sons of bitches."

38:39.190 --> 38:43.024
Those were his exact words,
I whacked both the sons of bitches"?

38:43.094 --> 38:45.756
Yeah, yeah, his exact words.

38:45.830 --> 38:47.855
What was your response?

38:47.932 --> 38:51.129
What do I care about his story?

38:51.202 --> 38:53.636
He gets taken off,
that's his problem.

38:53.705 --> 38:56.572
He whacks the Colon brothers,
that's his problem.

38:56.641 --> 39:00.771
Okay, Mr. Giardella,
that's going to be very helpful.

39:00.845 --> 39:05.873
You know, Agosto Reyes...
Was only one of my people.

39:05.950 --> 39:09.351
I got a lot of others.
You got about half of'em in your jail.

39:09.421 --> 39:13.414
Those cases belong to other
prosecutors, other jurisdiction.

39:13.491 --> 39:15.925
Yeah, but I like
working with you.

39:15.994 --> 39:18.189
I feel very comfortable
and at my ease.

39:18.263 --> 39:22.563
Not to mention you're the most
attractive D.A. I've seen in my life.

39:24.469 --> 39:28.303
You know, there's trust that comes
with a continual relationship.

39:28.373 --> 39:31.365
Maybe I could tell the U.S. Attorney
it's my preference...

39:31.443 --> 39:34.378
to deal with you people.

39:34.446 --> 39:38.405
But what I know, you could be
in a position here, Mr. Craig.

39:49.761 --> 39:51.752
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:51.830 --> 39:55.891
Hey, uh... I appreciate
what you did, Detective.

39:55.967 --> 39:59.403
- No problem, Martinez.
- Nah, I know what you did for me.

39:59.471 --> 40:02.963
What's goin' on with your brother?

40:03.041 --> 40:05.305
I can't talk to you about that.

40:06.878 --> 40:09.142
Come here.
You can talk to me.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.960
He's got, uh,
a substance abuse problem.

40:25.029 --> 40:27.862
- What kind?
- Narcotics, you know.

40:27.932 --> 40:29.957
Heroin.

40:30.034 --> 40:33.231
He's my little brother.
I'm supposed to take care of him,

40:33.304 --> 40:36.068
and I don't know what to do.

40:38.576 --> 40:41.010
When we were kids,
we were at Yankee Stadium...

40:41.079 --> 40:43.912
the day Reggie hit three home runs
in the same game.

40:43.982 --> 40:47.315
- Did you know Martinez is ReggieJackson's middle name?
- No.

40:48.553 --> 40:51.249
We cut up a piece of grass.

40:51.322 --> 40:54.519
He's still got that.
He takes care of it.

40:56.828 --> 41:00.229
I know he's not gone.
The dope hasn't eaten him up yet.

41:00.298 --> 41:03.062
Don't be afraid
to reach out to him.

41:03.134 --> 41:07.230
You read all that stuff about
tough love, letting 'em hit rock bottom?

41:08.807 --> 41:11.332
Don't be afraid
to reach out to him.

41:12.544 --> 41:14.637
- Okay?
- Okay.

41:14.712 --> 41:17.647
I wish I could be
more helpful than that.

41:17.715 --> 41:20.149
You helped me plenty, Detective.

41:20.218 --> 41:23.210
Really.

41:23.288 --> 41:25.654
Thanks again.

41:39.504 --> 41:43.065
Hey, John, could I talk
to you for a minute?

41:43.141 --> 41:45.075
Sure.

41:45.143 --> 41:48.169
This thing with the, uh, bad cop,

41:48.246 --> 41:52.546
uh, it's, uh, it's-it's
not exactly sittin' right.

41:52.617 --> 41:56.280
- Let's talk about it.
- I mean, not that he shouldn't have been brought in,

41:56.354 --> 42:00.450
but, uh, I mean, we're not I.A.D.,
you know?

42:00.525 --> 42:02.891
Anyway, um,

42:02.961 --> 42:06.260
if you'd like to say something
that might help, I wanna listen.

42:06.331 --> 42:09.698
You'll listen, Medavoy, huh?
You come up, clearing your throat...

42:09.767 --> 42:11.962
like a senator,
saying you'll listen?

42:12.036 --> 42:14.095
- He doesn't have to say dick to you.
- Andy.

42:14.172 --> 42:17.767
The cop Kelly put away
killed an 80-year-old man.

42:17.842 --> 42:21.437
He let him fall through a balcony and
break his neck. He croaked another lady,

42:21.512 --> 42:24.276
suffocated her with gas for money
to clear out an apartment building.

42:24.349 --> 42:28.149
I said I wanted to listen!
I wanted to listen.

42:28.219 --> 42:31.086
Kelly stood in for a kid with two years on
the job who was gonna have to wear a wire,

42:31.155 --> 42:33.646
and that would've put
that kid on the rat squad.

42:33.725 --> 42:35.716
Kelly did the right thing.

42:35.793 --> 42:38.318
And if you or any other one
of you guys got a problem with that,

42:38.396 --> 42:40.330
you can see me in
the parking lot right now.

42:40.398 --> 42:42.730
- You took me all wrong!
- Andy, that's enough.

42:42.800 --> 42:45.496
You never give me a chance to-to...
to explain what I'm saying.

42:45.570 --> 42:48.300
Medavoy, hold it.

42:48.373 --> 42:51.968
I understand what you were trying to
say, okay, and I appreciate the offer.

42:52.043 --> 42:55.069
- How about pizza and beer any night this week?
- How about tomorrow night?

42:55.146 --> 42:57.307
- My kid's got a piano recital tonight.
- Fine.

42:57.382 --> 43:01.842
Pass the word... I'm buying. Anybody
who wants to come can come. Okay?

43:01.920 --> 43:04.684
Fair enough.

43:07.892 --> 43:09.726
Come on.

43:09.727 --> 43:11.160
Come on.

43:11.229 --> 43:13.254
Hey, Martinez.

43:13.331 --> 43:15.925
Hey, Sarge.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.197
There's a kid downstairs,
got pinched in a drug bust.

43:19.270 --> 43:22.364
He says he's your brother.

43:22.440 --> 43:25.603
I guess you gotta do
what you gotta do, huh, Sarge?

43:25.677 --> 43:27.941
He wasn't holding.
It's a loitering beef.

43:28.012 --> 43:32.039
I could walk him
out the back door.

43:32.116 --> 43:35.347
I'll hold him till the shift's over.
I'll pick him up.

43:35.420 --> 43:37.479
Thanks, Sarge.

43:58.876 --> 44:02.505
What's this?
What you stoppin' here for?

44:02.580 --> 44:05.071
I wanna talk to you about Roberto.

44:05.149 --> 44:09.085
Well, this is a hospital.
Did something happen to him? Is he hurt?

44:09.153 --> 44:12.554
- What's happening? What's going on?
- He's sick, Papi.

44:13.758 --> 44:15.919
He's in the chemical
dependency unit.

44:18.496 --> 44:21.363
What the hell is
a chemical dependency unit?

44:21.432 --> 44:24.595
It's where they help people
addicted to drugs.

44:24.669 --> 44:27.661
- Well, you go in.
- Papi.

44:27.739 --> 44:30.537
Look, I don't like junkies,
I don't wanna see a junkie...

44:30.608 --> 44:33.042
Roberto is sick, Papi,
and he needs us!

44:33.111 --> 44:35.807
No, no, he's a junkie.
You understand that?

44:35.880 --> 44:38.405
And junkies don't get better.
You got it?

44:41.986 --> 44:44.955
- Okay, Papi, I'll go in.
- Yeah, you go in.

44:45.023 --> 44:46.957
- I'll see him.
- Yeah, you'll see him.

44:47.025 --> 44:50.222
You can wait here, okay? When I
come back out, then we can drive away.

44:50.294 --> 44:52.228
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay?

44:58.536 --> 45:00.470
Damn!

45:10.882 --> 45:12.816
James!

45:12.884 --> 45:14.852
James, wait.

45:19.524 --> 45:22.618
We'll do it together, okay?
It's better.

45:22.693 --> 45:24.627
Okay.

45:38.876 --> 45:41.367
How are they treatin' the kid?

45:41.446 --> 45:44.745
- It's gonna be okay.
- That's good.

45:44.816 --> 45:46.807
I'm thinking, Kelly...

45:46.884 --> 45:52.254
I'm thinking maybe there's been a little
progress in the police department after all.

45:52.323 --> 45:56.259
I remember 15 years ago a rookie cop
walks into a D.O.A. Scene,

45:56.327 --> 46:00.627
sees his partner taking money off a dead
person and putting it into his pocket.

46:00.698 --> 46:05.567
And for giving him up, this rookie is
hung out to dry by every cop on the job.

46:07.705 --> 46:10.401
You can see how nice
it was for me...

46:10.475 --> 46:13.205
watching you bust your ass
for that kid.

46:13.277 --> 46:16.974
I wish it could have been
different for you, Kevin.

46:21.052 --> 46:24.021
- You still go to the Emerald Society?
- No.

46:24.088 --> 46:27.114
- No, I can't drink like that anymore.
- I don't go.

46:27.191 --> 46:29.455
No one will talk to me.

46:29.527 --> 46:34.123
They're all afraid they'll get drunk,
confess their sins and I'll arrest them.

46:34.198 --> 46:37.133
You know, I don't care
about no one talking to me.

46:37.201 --> 46:40.898
I knew that would happen
when I busted that cop.

46:40.972 --> 46:43.907
But I always wanted to play
in the Emerald Society Piper's Band,

46:43.975 --> 46:47.342
and not one of those bastards
will recommend me.

46:47.411 --> 46:49.936
I'm the best piper in the department,
and nobody knows it...

46:50.014 --> 46:52.209
except a bunch of croakers.

46:59.557 --> 47:03.788
- You know what Piobracht" is, Kelly?
- No.

47:06.023 --> 47:08.116
Well, listen.

47:08.192 --> 47:11.127
This is called Piobracht."
