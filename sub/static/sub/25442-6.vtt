00:06.120 --> 00:07.380
And then the elephant says,

00:07.380 --> 00:09.290
"Check the trunk."

00:09.290 --> 00:10.290
(laughing)

00:10.290 --> 00:12.380
I don't get it.
Elephants don't drive.

Hey, why is there soup
all over the floor

02:22.580 --> 02:23.790
in the dining room?

02:23.790 --> 02:25.420
Uh, 'cause of your stomping.

02:25.420 --> 02:27.460
-Stepping.
-Oh, she knows what that is.

02:27.460 --> 02:28.540
Don't you, Rae?

02:28.540 --> 02:30.080
I know nothing
of what you think

02:30.080 --> 02:31.460
I might know something about.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.040
Now I have to know.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.670
Well, um, your mother,

02:34.670 --> 02:35.750
she used to step.

02:35.750 --> 02:36.830
No, I didn't.
Never happened.

02:36.830 --> 02:38.960
Oh, come on.
Don't listen to her.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.500
She was a great stepper.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.710
Remember, you were
all like... like...

02:41.710 --> 02:44.040
One, two three.
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.920
-Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh!
-I never did--

02:45.920 --> 02:48.000
I never did anything

02:48.000 --> 02:49.580
-of the sort, Chels.
-What?

02:49.580 --> 02:51.380
Mom, this is so cool

02:51.380 --> 02:52.790
that I'm following
in your foot...

02:54.040 --> 02:54.920
"step."

02:55.710 --> 02:57.380
You get it?

02:57.380 --> 02:58.580
Poor baby.

02:58.580 --> 02:59.580
She gets her sense of humor

02:59.580 --> 03:00.500
from her daddy.

03:02.620 --> 03:04.000
Don't change the subject.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.500
I'm not gonna let you
side "step"... this one.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.120
(whispering)
Okay, this has
to stop right now.

03:13.460 --> 03:16.120
Listen, baby girl,
it was a long time ago.

03:16.120 --> 03:19.460
I stepped, I stopped,
end of story.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.540
Hey, Mom, can I get
a 7:30 wake-up call tomorrow?

03:23.540 --> 03:25.540
Yes, Booker. Yes.

03:25.540 --> 03:27.170
Hey, would you like me

03:27.170 --> 03:28.920
to also warm
your slippers too?

03:28.920 --> 03:31.040
That'd be nice. Would you?

03:31.040 --> 03:32.000
No.

03:32.710 --> 03:33.920
Fine.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.250
Just the wake-up call then.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.080
(clicks tongue)

03:38.250 --> 03:40.420
He needs a wake-up call,
'cause he must be dreaming!

03:45.120 --> 03:47.080
(sighs)
Okay. (clears throat)

03:47.080 --> 03:50.880
This is an alarm clock.
All right?

03:50.880 --> 03:53.120
If you want to wake up
at 7:30,

03:53.120 --> 03:54.500
wake yourself up...

03:54.500 --> 03:56.750
then your sister, then me.

03:57.960 --> 04:00.080
-What about my mom?
-Why does she need
a wake-up call?

04:00.080 --> 04:02.000
-She ain't got no job.
-Chelsea: I heard that, Rae!

04:02.000 --> 04:04.880
I was hoping
you would, Chels!

04:04.880 --> 04:06.250
Good night, boys.

04:08.250 --> 04:10.880
Wow! You could land
a plane with that light.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.460
There is no way
I'm gonna be able to sleep.

04:13.460 --> 04:14.580
What about you, Booker?

04:14.580 --> 04:15.750
(snoring loudly)

04:16.830 --> 04:17.790
Booker?

04:28.620 --> 04:30.420
This pancake shaped
like Abe Lincoln

04:30.420 --> 04:32.540
with a whipped cream beard
and a chocolate hat is...

04:33.460 --> 04:34.290
delicious.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.250
(snoring)

04:39.620 --> 04:40.920
(beeping)

04:43.330 --> 04:44.540
(yelps, gasps)

04:45.920 --> 04:46.960
Levi.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.330
Why are you staring at me?

04:49.330 --> 04:51.750
Because that clock
kept me up all night,

04:51.750 --> 04:53.540
and I needed
something to do.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.120
Well, it's just a little weird.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.620
Not as weird as what you were
saying in your sleep.

04:57.620 --> 04:59.790
Something about
you eating a pancake

04:59.790 --> 05:01.920
shaped like Abe Lincoln
with a whipped cream beard

05:01.920 --> 05:02.960
and a chocolate hat.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.670
(scoffs)
Abe Lincoln pancakes?

05:06.580 --> 05:07.670
I don't think that's a thing.

05:08.670 --> 05:09.920
Booker and Levi:
Whoa!

05:10.710 --> 05:11.960
It is a thing!

05:11.960 --> 05:13.750
They're good, huh?

05:13.750 --> 05:15.960
Booker, you know
what this means?

05:15.960 --> 05:17.420
Yeah.

05:17.420 --> 05:19.670
I totally had
a sleep vision.

05:19.670 --> 05:21.120
This is so cool.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.670
It's like my superpower...

05:22.670 --> 05:23.790
has a superpower.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.380
This is awesome.

05:25.380 --> 05:27.620
Oh, tonight, you have
to stay up all night

05:27.620 --> 05:28.750
to see what I say next.

05:28.750 --> 05:31.000
Starting to sound less awesome.

05:32.790 --> 05:34.460
I told y'all to wake me up.

05:34.460 --> 05:35.830
We tried.

05:35.830 --> 05:38.460
You used my head
as a snooze button.

05:38.460 --> 05:40.210
That means come back
in eight minutes.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.380
You all came here today
with a dream

05:48.380 --> 05:50.790
of one day being
a Chili Stepper.

05:50.790 --> 05:52.080
But...

05:52.080 --> 05:54.620
do you really have
what it takes?

05:55.880 --> 05:57.170
(shouts)
Do you?

05:57.170 --> 05:58.790
I think I'm a little nervous.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.250
I think I'm a lot nervous.

06:00.250 --> 06:01.880
I think I'm getting
a phone call.

06:01.880 --> 06:02.960
Hello?

06:05.710 --> 06:08.330
You will now attempt
to perform our routine.

06:08.330 --> 06:09.460
One misstep...

06:09.460 --> 06:10.670
and you're out!

06:10.670 --> 06:11.880
Good luck, everyone.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.790
And five, six, seven, eight!

06:16.250 --> 06:17.580
Misstep. You're out!

06:18.540 --> 06:19.790
Misstep. Bye now!

06:20.790 --> 06:22.580
Misstep. Toodles!

06:22.580 --> 06:23.830
Misstep. See ya!

06:28.750 --> 06:31.170
(chuckles)
Congrats, ladies.

06:31.170 --> 06:33.540
You both have what it takes
to be a Chili Stepper.

06:33.540 --> 06:35.210
-That's awesome!
-Whoa! Thank you!

06:35.210 --> 06:38.380
Unfortunately, we only
have room for one of you,

06:38.380 --> 06:40.750
but since you're friends,
we'll let you decide.

06:40.750 --> 06:41.580
Take your time.

06:41.580 --> 06:42.790
-Okay.
-Time's up.

06:45.210 --> 06:47.120
-You should take the spot, Nia.
-No, you.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.540
-No, you.
-No, you.

06:48.540 --> 06:49.790
-No, you.
-No, you.

06:49.790 --> 06:51.580
-No, you.
-No, you.

06:51.580 --> 06:53.000
-No, you.
-No, you.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.790
What is with all
the "no, you"?

06:55.880 --> 06:57.290
I'll talk to you later, Tess.

06:58.380 --> 07:00.120
Mom, can I ask you
a question?

07:00.120 --> 07:02.460
Yeah, well, you just did,
sweetie. Have a good night.

07:02.460 --> 07:03.620
Oh. Uh...

07:03.620 --> 07:04.920
Just playing.
What do you want?

07:06.250 --> 07:08.830
Well, Tess and I crushed it
at the auditions today.

07:08.830 --> 07:10.710
-Yes! Baxters!
-Yes.

07:11.380 --> 07:13.960
But the Chili Steppers
only have one spot,

07:13.960 --> 07:17.380
and they're making us decide
who's gonna take it.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.000
What do I do?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.790
-That's hard.
-Yeah.

07:20.790 --> 07:21.790
Umm...

07:22.880 --> 07:24.210
Tess is your bestie, right?

07:24.210 --> 07:25.580
So there's really only

07:25.580 --> 07:26.880
one thing you can do--

07:28.120 --> 07:30.790
you gotta be there for her
when you take that spot.

07:32.830 --> 07:34.750
-Mom.
-What? I'm ser--

07:34.750 --> 07:37.960
Okay, okay, okay.
(clears throat)

07:37.960 --> 07:40.750
You just have to ask yourself,
what do you really want?

07:41.960 --> 07:44.830
(chuckles)
Well, I know
what I don't want--

07:44.830 --> 07:46.170
to step without Tess.

07:46.170 --> 07:47.500
We do everything together.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.830
And when we step,
we're so in sync,

07:48.830 --> 07:49.960
it's like we're one person.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.920
Well, it sounds like you know
exactly what you want.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.620
Isn't there any other team

07:55.620 --> 07:57.500
that has room
for the both of you?

07:59.380 --> 08:00.540
Not yet.

08:05.710 --> 08:07.830
Are you crazy?

08:07.830 --> 08:09.830
We can't form
our own step team.

08:09.830 --> 08:12.880
Why not?
Principal Wentworth said
if we form a team,

08:12.880 --> 08:15.420
we can challenge
the Chili Steppers to a step-off

08:15.420 --> 08:17.120
to see who represents
our school in the regionals.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.920
But we don't have a team.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.790
Where are we gonna find
other steppers?

08:20.790 --> 08:22.830
Hey, show me that again.

08:22.830 --> 08:24.710
-(phone beeps)
-(Booker snoring)

08:26.670 --> 08:29.670
Look at that girl in the gym
in the purple hat.

08:29.670 --> 08:31.290
Dang, she can step.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.250
-Who can step?
-What are you watching?

08:36.250 --> 08:39.000
Just a video of me having
a sleep vision last night.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is huge.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.620
Well, it's just another
little psychic power I have

08:43.620 --> 08:44.830
and you don't.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.250
Don't care about that.

08:47.250 --> 08:48.920
Do care that there's
someone in the gym

08:48.920 --> 08:49.750
-who can step.
-Yeah.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.710
Look at Taylor step.

08:57.830 --> 08:59.210
This was your vision.

08:59.210 --> 09:02.580
No. My vision
was me saying

09:02.580 --> 09:05.670
"Look at that girl in the gym
in the purple hat.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.250
Dang, she can step."

09:10.960 --> 09:12.920
That was my vision!

09:12.920 --> 09:14.500
My vision was me saying

09:14.500 --> 09:16.120
what my vision was.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.170
(imitating explosion)

09:22.040 --> 09:23.920
Aaah!

09:28.960 --> 09:31.250
Oh, I was just...

09:32.210 --> 09:33.790
This isn't the library.

09:35.880 --> 09:37.670
Oh, so, ladies,

09:37.670 --> 09:39.920
have you decided which one
of you is gonna have

09:39.920 --> 09:41.960
the honor of calling
yourself a Chili?

09:41.960 --> 09:44.420
Yeah. Neither.

09:44.420 --> 09:47.210
We're forming our own team
and challenging you

09:47.210 --> 09:48.920
to a step-off.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.710
(chuckles)
Really?

09:50.710 --> 09:52.620
And who's gonna be
on this team of yours?

09:52.620 --> 09:55.000
Well, for starters, Taylor.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.290
(anxiously)
Taylor what?

09:57.290 --> 09:59.000
Taylor, you're gonna be

09:59.000 --> 10:00.250
on our new step team.

10:01.290 --> 10:03.880
Me? On your step team?

10:05.120 --> 10:06.790
My mom is calling. Again!

10:07.920 --> 10:11.080
Looks like your new team
is as real as her phone.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.750
Ha-ha! Joke's on you!

10:13.750 --> 10:15.000
Her phone is fake.

10:16.000 --> 10:16.830
What?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Oh.

10:25.380 --> 10:27.210
Welcome to the study group.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.920
Thanks so much
for including me.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.380
What are we going
to study first?

10:30.380 --> 10:32.420
Math? American history?

10:32.420 --> 10:34.420
I was thinking... step.

10:35.750 --> 10:36.620
All: Ha!

10:36.620 --> 10:38.620
Hey, you guys tricked me.

10:38.620 --> 10:40.620
Only because when we asked you
to be on the team,

10:40.620 --> 10:41.960
you ran away.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.210
Four times.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.620
-Five.
-Please, Taylor?

10:45.620 --> 10:48.250
-We've seen you step.
-You're amazing.

10:48.250 --> 10:50.920
But I get too nervous
in front of people.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.670
Everyone's watching me.

10:52.670 --> 10:55.000
(clicks tongue)
No one's watching you.

10:56.420 --> 10:57.670
(whispers)
Stop watching her.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.290
And besides,
when we perform,

11:01.290 --> 11:04.000
no one will be watching you.
They'll be watching us.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.620
-We'll be like a team.
-Yeah.

11:05.620 --> 11:06.620
(chuckles)

11:08.170 --> 11:10.250
I've always wanted
to be part of a team.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.580
It looks like fun.

11:11.580 --> 11:13.960
-Well, then welcome to the fun.
-Yeah.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.620
-Whoo!
-This is-- This is perfect.

11:16.620 --> 11:18.960
Now, all we have to find
is a coach.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.120
Someone with experience.
Someone who really knows
how to step.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.670
I have snacks!
(laughs)

11:25.000 --> 11:26.460
Why y'all staring at me?

11:27.580 --> 11:29.210
You look lovely today, Mom.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.420
Thank you.
I am, uh,

11:31.420 --> 11:32.830
wearing my waist trainer today.

11:32.830 --> 11:33.920
(inhales sharply)

11:34.830 --> 11:36.540
This doesn't look like
a study group.

11:36.540 --> 11:38.460
We need you to be
our step coach.

11:38.460 --> 11:40.170
Oh.
Hey, baby,

11:40.170 --> 11:42.170
remember when I told you
I would do anything for you?

11:42.170 --> 11:44.580
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I lied. Bye.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.380
Whoa! Mom.

11:46.380 --> 11:48.330
Why do you hate stepping
so much?

11:48.330 --> 11:51.620
Yeah. Who hurt you, Miss B?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.500
Fine. I'll tell you.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.000
-I'm cursed.
-Cursed?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.120
Yes. Cursed!

11:58.120 --> 12:00.960
I used to be on a step team
when I was in college and...

12:00.960 --> 12:03.790
(exhales)
...we were right there
at Nationals,

12:03.790 --> 12:06.580
and we were just about to win
the championship when...

12:06.580 --> 12:08.620
despite being
in perfect sync--

12:08.620 --> 12:11.040
I mean, the judges
were loving us.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.540
-And I was looking fly until...
-(fly buzzing)

12:13.540 --> 12:16.080
...a fly landed on me.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.250
I tried to swat it away,

12:17.250 --> 12:19.790
but it was...
personal to him.

12:19.790 --> 12:21.920
(screams)
Oh!

12:21.920 --> 12:24.830
(grunting)

12:27.080 --> 12:29.080
-Mom...
-(sobbing)

12:29.080 --> 12:31.670
...you're not cursed.
You just had a fly
on your nose.

12:31.670 --> 12:34.420
No, that fly,
it was a winged demon!

12:36.290 --> 12:38.750
Are you really gonna let
that fly win?

12:38.750 --> 12:41.830
Yes. Yes, I am.

12:41.830 --> 12:44.380
Well, sweetheart, listen.
I will--

12:44.380 --> 12:45.540
-I'll do you this.
-Mm-hmm.

12:45.540 --> 12:47.080
All right.
I won't coach your team,

12:47.080 --> 12:48.880
but I will make
your team costumes for you.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.670
-Thank you, Mom.
-Yup, no worries.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.790
-Tess and I will figure out
the coaching thing.
-Yeah.

12:52.790 --> 12:54.620
-Let's go.
-(door opens)

12:54.620 --> 12:57.120
Hello, ladies.
(laughs)

12:59.210 --> 13:00.540
Goodbye, ladies.

13:00.540 --> 13:02.080
Come on, buddy.

13:03.210 --> 13:04.960
Let's go wash
that rejection down

13:04.960 --> 13:06.210
with a little chocolate milk.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.620
All right, girls. Let's start
off with some basic steps

13:12.620 --> 13:14.080
to get us all in sync.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.620
-(blows whistles)
-Oh. What is that?

13:16.620 --> 13:19.420
It's a whistle.
The coach gets a whistle.

13:19.420 --> 13:22.830
-♪ And five, six, seven-- ♪
-How come you're the coach?

13:22.830 --> 13:24.420
'Cause I have the whistle.

13:24.420 --> 13:26.080
♪ And five, six, seven-- ♪

13:26.080 --> 13:28.290
I know you have
the whistle and everything,

13:28.290 --> 13:31.540
but... how come you have
the whistle and everything?

13:32.960 --> 13:34.290
I just thought since I came up

13:34.290 --> 13:36.460
with most of our routine,
I'd be in charge.

13:36.460 --> 13:38.170
You didn't come up
with all of it.

13:38.170 --> 13:40.960
I came up with
all the... swag moves.

13:40.960 --> 13:44.080
Well, I came up with all
the precision and structure.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.380
which is way more important
to the judges.

13:45.380 --> 13:47.710
Well, it's way more fun
to watch this

13:47.710 --> 13:49.420
than looking like a robot--

13:49.420 --> 13:50.920
"Beep boop bop."
(snores)

13:50.920 --> 13:53.290
Now, I'm a sleeping judge.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.330
The only reason
the judges would be asleep

13:55.330 --> 13:57.170
is because
they're so unimpressed

13:57.170 --> 13:58.960
by all your sloppy moves.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.460
(blows whistle)

14:02.420 --> 14:04.790
Sorry. You dropped this.

14:04.790 --> 14:06.250
Nia and Tess:
I'll take it.

14:08.210 --> 14:10.710
Hi, Mom. You want me
to come home?

14:10.710 --> 14:13.460
And drop the whistle?
Okay.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.170
No!

14:23.000 --> 14:26.420
Booker, I really need
someone to talk to.

14:27.710 --> 14:30.620
I usually talk to Tess
when I have a problem,

14:30.620 --> 14:32.170
but now she's the problem.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.830
I just don't get why
she won't let me coach?

14:35.830 --> 14:38.170
She totally ruined
practice tonight.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.330
I just wish
the Chilis had two spots.

14:45.210 --> 14:47.210
Maybe I should just be
the better friend...

14:48.330 --> 14:50.120
and let Tess coach
the team.

14:51.620 --> 14:53.000
What do you think, Booker?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.460
Think about what?

14:56.210 --> 14:58.830
-He was in the bathroom.
-And you just let me
keep talking?

14:58.830 --> 15:01.330
I can't sleep.
I'm bored.

15:01.330 --> 15:03.250
So what happens next?

15:11.420 --> 15:13.000
-Oh, sorry.
-No worries.

15:13.670 --> 15:15.210
Oh.

15:15.210 --> 15:17.670
-Hey, Tess.
-Hey, uh...

15:17.670 --> 15:19.380
what are you doing
at the Chilis' practice?

15:19.380 --> 15:21.420
What are you doing
at the Chilis' practice?

15:21.420 --> 15:22.920
I asked you first.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.620
Oh. Okay. Well, um...

15:25.620 --> 15:27.790
I was thinking
after yesterday,

15:27.790 --> 15:29.500
and I thought I'd be
a good friend

15:29.500 --> 15:30.460
and let you coach our team.

15:30.460 --> 15:31.620
You know, I just step away--

15:31.620 --> 15:33.290
And step into that

15:33.290 --> 15:34.670
open spot
in the Chilis?

15:36.290 --> 15:37.380
Well, I, uh... I--

15:37.380 --> 15:40.920
You know...
last time I checked,

15:40.920 --> 15:43.000
good friends don't do
each other like that.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
Oh, really?
Then why don't you
answer my question:

15:46.000 --> 15:47.120
What are you doing here?

15:48.120 --> 15:49.920
Oh, well...

15:49.920 --> 15:51.290
-I, uh--
-Liar!

15:51.290 --> 15:53.120
You didn't even let me lie!

15:53.120 --> 15:56.120
You came here to take
that spot on the Chilis too.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.620
What? You think you're the only
one who can be a good friend?

15:58.620 --> 16:01.040
No, but I'm a faster friend.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.170
Both:
I want to be a Chili!

16:03.170 --> 16:05.380
Yeah, um,
about that last spot--

16:05.380 --> 16:07.380
sorry, ladies,
it's been filled.

16:07.380 --> 16:08.250
By who?

16:09.500 --> 16:12.250
Hi, Nia. Hi, Tess.

16:12.250 --> 16:13.170
Both:
Taylor?

16:14.500 --> 16:16.960
Sorry, but all your fighting
was just so awkward.

16:20.210 --> 16:21.250
Kind of like now.

16:22.380 --> 16:25.290
Way to go.
See what you trying
to be a good friend did?

16:25.290 --> 16:27.080
Would you like it better
if we weren't friends at all?

16:27.080 --> 16:29.330
-Maybe I would.
-Maybe I would too,

16:29.330 --> 16:31.290
'cause I don't need
a friend like you.

16:42.750 --> 16:45.380
(sighs) Sorry to bother you
in the bathroom, Booker, but...

16:46.460 --> 16:49.290
Tess and I got
in a really bad fight, and...

16:50.420 --> 16:51.710
I said something...

16:53.040 --> 16:54.420
but I think I went
way too far.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.380
Now I don't know what to do.

17:00.460 --> 17:01.540
Booker?

17:04.420 --> 17:06.830
I can't tell you
what to do about Tess,

17:06.830 --> 17:09.420
but I can tell you--
do not go in there.

17:15.920 --> 17:19.460
Huh. The lottery jackpot
is up to ten million.

17:21.460 --> 17:23.460
Finally, another sleep vision.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.000
I hope it's
the winning lottery numbers.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.620
Man, there's no way
Nia and Tess

17:28.620 --> 17:30.120
are gonna win
the step-off now.

17:31.330 --> 17:33.040
(snoring)

17:33.040 --> 17:35.170
Ugh, I stayed up for this?

17:40.170 --> 17:42.830
I really said Nia and Tess
are gonna lose?

17:43.960 --> 17:46.250
Wow. I guess
the good news is

17:46.250 --> 17:47.500
they figure out
how to step together.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.040
Just in time to lose,
blame each other,

17:50.040 --> 17:52.250
and ruin their friendship
for good.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.250
Oh, man,
this is terrible.

17:55.670 --> 17:56.830
How are you
gonna tell her?

17:58.380 --> 18:01.710
Me? It was your sleep vision.
You tell her.

18:01.710 --> 18:04.750
-No, you.
-No, you.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.080
-No, you.
-No, you.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.540
-No, you.
-No, you.

18:08.540 --> 18:10.420
Now what are you two
"no, you'ing" about?

18:10.420 --> 18:11.960
Booker had a sleep vision.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.250
You get sleep visions?

18:14.250 --> 18:15.830
Only for the past few nights.

18:15.830 --> 18:19.500
Oh, I used to get
the best sleep visions.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.710
But then again
they never came true,

18:21.710 --> 18:25.170
so I guess you can just
call them broken dreams.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.500
-Not about you, Mom.
-It's always about me, Booker.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.620
(clears throat)
So what was I doing
in your vision?

18:32.620 --> 18:35.500
No. It was Tess and Nia.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.540
They're fighting and now
they're gonna lose
the step competition.

18:38.540 --> 18:40.460
And we're trying to decide
who should tell her.

18:40.460 --> 18:41.460
-Oh.
-(gasps)

18:42.500 --> 18:45.170
Since you're the mom,
you should tell her.

18:45.170 --> 18:48.460
Oh, well, I am the mom,
and I am telling you

18:48.460 --> 18:49.620
that you should tell her.

18:49.620 --> 18:52.460
-No, you.
-No, you.

18:52.460 --> 18:53.620
-No, you.
-No, you.

18:53.620 --> 18:56.080
Wait a second.
How did I get involved
with the "no, you'ing"?

18:57.580 --> 18:59.960
Listen, I will tell her, okay.

18:59.960 --> 19:03.420
I just-- I just have
to figure out a way
they can work together

19:03.420 --> 19:05.330
so they won't lose,
you know?

19:07.040 --> 19:08.540
Together.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.620
Mom, is this really necessary?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.080
Yes, it is, Nia.
Yes, it is.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.710
Because you two need to learn

19:16.710 --> 19:18.620
to work together again. And--

19:18.620 --> 19:20.620
Ooh. Ooh! One of y'all
need to take a shower

19:20.620 --> 19:22.790
'cause it is rank up in here.

19:22.790 --> 19:24.250
Both:
That's her.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.000
Oh, no, Rae, that's...
that's you.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.380
You're standing in a pile

19:27.380 --> 19:30.540
of fresh organic
horse-made fertilizer.

19:30.540 --> 19:32.790
-You mean poop?
-There it is.

19:35.580 --> 19:38.670
Listen, stepping is
about precision.

19:38.670 --> 19:40.920
-See?
-It is also about swag.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.670
-See?
-But if you do not have both,

19:43.670 --> 19:45.790
they you are not able to win.

19:45.790 --> 19:48.380
And you know what, we need
to get you two back in sync.

19:48.380 --> 19:50.420
-We can't step in this thing.
-Yeah.

19:50.420 --> 19:52.580
Who said anything
about steppin'?

19:52.580 --> 19:54.500
Y'all are gonna be planting
pea pods.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.750
Oh. Actually no, Rae.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.540
They'll be planting
baby zucchini.

19:57.540 --> 19:59.080
(laughing)

19:59.080 --> 20:01.250
But the whole "pea
in a pod" thing,

20:01.250 --> 20:03.500
that works better
for the lesson.

20:04.540 --> 20:07.250
All right, now get over here
and start planting.

20:08.330 --> 20:09.580
-(cell phone ringing)
-(sighs)

20:09.580 --> 20:10.830
Your phone is ringing.

20:10.830 --> 20:12.670
It's in your side pocket.
Get it!

20:12.670 --> 20:14.080
-No, you get it.
-No, you get it.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.250
-No, you.
-I will get it!

20:15.250 --> 20:17.380
Watch me get it!
I will get it.

20:17.380 --> 20:18.540
-(Tess grunts)
-I will get it!

20:19.620 --> 20:20.710
(phone continues ringing)

20:20.710 --> 20:22.330
When does this
start working?

20:22.330 --> 20:24.460
Give me--
Give me the phone.

20:26.540 --> 20:29.620
Oh, hey, Nia.
And Tess?

20:29.620 --> 20:31.250
Thought you two weren't
speaking to each other.

20:31.250 --> 20:32.750
What do you want, Zeena?

20:32.750 --> 20:34.960
We realized
it was kinda unfair

20:34.960 --> 20:36.540
to only add one new Chili,

20:36.540 --> 20:39.120
so we decided to add
a few more steppers.

20:39.120 --> 20:41.460
You want us to be
on your team now?

20:41.460 --> 20:44.000
No, we wanted all your
teammates, and we got 'em.

20:45.750 --> 20:48.670
So you probably don't even need
to show up tonight. Bye.

20:50.170 --> 20:51.830
Both:
This is your fault.

20:51.830 --> 20:54.710
Well, it's probably
for the best anyway.

20:54.710 --> 20:57.000
I had a vision
you guys were gonna lose.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.500
Red Hot Chili Steppers!

21:10.620 --> 21:11.460
All: Hey! Hey!

21:17.330 --> 21:19.500
(cheering and applause)

21:21.460 --> 21:24.750
Thank you! And since it looks
like no other teams showed up,

21:24.750 --> 21:26.210
I guess we win.

21:26.210 --> 21:27.670
Nia:
You guessed wrong.

21:27.670 --> 21:29.040
Step off the stage.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.540
(cheering)

21:32.830 --> 21:35.290
Stepping is about precision.

21:38.790 --> 21:39.830
Hey, hey!

21:39.830 --> 21:41.290
Move away.

21:41.290 --> 21:43.960
Stepping is about swag.

21:45.880 --> 21:47.290
Hey! Hey!

21:47.290 --> 21:48.620
Precision.

21:50.750 --> 21:51.960
-Hey!
-Swag.

21:51.960 --> 21:55.670
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, yeah, hey.

21:55.670 --> 21:58.670
-Hey. Hey, hey! Hey.
-(audience laughing)

21:58.670 --> 21:59.790
Precision.

21:59.790 --> 22:01.750
Swag.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.620
(audience laughing, murmuring)

22:04.620 --> 22:07.580
Nia: But the best
step routines have both.

22:08.670 --> 22:12.040
Are you ready
for a little Swagcision?

22:12.040 --> 22:13.830
-Yes!
-(cheering)

22:13.830 --> 22:15.830
Hey, your plan worked.

22:15.830 --> 22:17.750
Let's do this!

22:17.750 --> 22:19.620
Nia and Tess:
Five, six, seven, eight!

22:19.620 --> 22:21.000
-(fly buzzing)
-Hey!

22:21.000 --> 22:22.500
-Hey!
-Nia and Tess: Hey! Hey!

22:22.500 --> 22:24.710
Get off the stage.
You're not cursin' my baby!

22:24.710 --> 22:25.830
-No!
-Hey!

22:25.830 --> 22:27.210
(gasps)
Hey. Hey.

22:27.210 --> 22:28.880
-Hey. Hey.
-Nia and Tess: Hey.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.620
-No, no, no. My baby. No!
-(Nia and Tess screaming)

22:32.620 --> 22:33.710
(clattering)

22:33.710 --> 22:34.790
(gasps)

22:34.790 --> 22:36.330
My baby! My baby.

22:36.330 --> 22:38.830
There's no way Nia and Tess
are gonna win the step-off now.

22:38.830 --> 22:40.380
And there's the sleep vision.

22:40.380 --> 22:41.580
(groaning)

22:41.580 --> 22:43.670
You guys,
this is all my fault.

22:43.670 --> 22:46.380
That winged demon,
it's trying to curse you.

22:46.380 --> 22:48.790
Or it was just
a regular fly

22:48.790 --> 22:51.830
that was attracted to the poop
that's still on your shoe

22:51.830 --> 22:52.880
and on their onesie.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.290
-That makes more sense.
-Yeah, it does.

22:56.290 --> 22:58.380
Yeah, it's nasty,
but it makes more sense.

23:00.830 --> 23:02.290
Nice try, girls,

23:02.290 --> 23:05.880
but your "swagcision" was
a bad de-cision.

23:05.880 --> 23:06.710
(laughs)

23:06.710 --> 23:08.710
(laughing)

23:09.710 --> 23:10.880
What's so funny?

23:10.880 --> 23:13.040
She stepped in your poop.

23:13.040 --> 23:16.420
-(fly buzzing)
-Hey! Get away from me,
you winged demon!

23:18.000 --> 23:19.290
You cursed her, Miss B.

23:19.290 --> 23:21.620
Anything for my baby
and her bestie.

23:22.790 --> 23:24.380
I'm just sorry that
you guys didn't win.

23:24.380 --> 23:26.540
I don't know.
I feel like I won.

23:26.540 --> 23:28.290
Yeah, me too.

23:28.290 --> 23:30.000
(laughing)

23:37.880 --> 23:39.120
The winning lottery numbers

23:39.120 --> 23:41.920
for the $10 million
jackpot are...

23:41.920 --> 23:44.380
three, four,

23:44.380 --> 23:46.960
19, 26,

23:46.960 --> 23:48.420
32.

23:49.540 --> 23:51.210
(snoring)

23:53.790 --> 23:57.500
Levi, I think I just had
a sleep vision. What did I say?

23:57.500 --> 23:59.330
(snoring)

24:02.580 --> 24:05.540
Oh, well. It's probably
nothing important.
