♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:06.834 --> 00:09.000
( upbeat funk music playing )

00:13.208 --> 00:17.125
We're Addison and Sam.
Addisam. We're a couple.

00:17.166 --> 00:19.500
He talks to me about feelings.
He's amazing in bed.

00:19.542 --> 00:22.375
He cooks for me. Food.

00:22.417 --> 00:26.000
Yeah, he's perfect.
I'm perfect with him. Addisam.

00:26.041 --> 00:27.792
She's freaking out.
Ignore her.

00:27.834 --> 00:29.208
Addisam.
I can't just ignore--

00:29.250 --> 00:31.041
Say something
shrinky, then.

00:31.083 --> 00:33.667
Uh, being a-- A happy couple
is a healthy thing.

00:33.709 --> 00:36.041
What's wrong with him?
He has no flaws.

00:36.083 --> 00:38.000
Well, he knows you.
You know him.

00:38.041 --> 00:39.667
There's love.
You have a good foundation.

00:39.709 --> 00:42.458
Is that a metaphor or like
floorboards and a basement?

00:42.500 --> 00:44.875
No, like he knows how to commit.
Like Pete knows how to commit.

00:44.917 --> 00:46.625
It's a good thing.
Really? Because in my--

00:46.667 --> 00:48.041
Shut up, bitches.

00:48.083 --> 00:51.750
I need to get laid.
I need to get laid really bad.

00:51.792 --> 00:53.625
So bad I am gonna run naked
through the streets

00:53.667 --> 00:55.709
and grind a cop if something
doesn't happen soon.

00:55.750 --> 00:57.041
Will one of you
just lie on top of me

00:57.083 --> 00:59.792
and rub around
for like ten minutes?

00:59.834 --> 01:02.500
I thought you and Mark Sloan--
That was weeks ago.

01:02.542 --> 01:06.000
Which in sex years
is like a decade ago.

01:06.041 --> 01:07.500
Where are all the men
in this city?

01:07.542 --> 01:09.041
( sighs )

01:09.083 --> 01:10.041
Sheldon is single.

01:10.083 --> 01:12.041
( laughing )

01:12.083 --> 01:13.166
Do you hate me or something?

01:13.208 --> 01:18.041
Sheldon is smart,
thoughtful, charming,

01:18.083 --> 01:19.875
and great in bed.

01:23.291 --> 01:24.917
Really?
Really?

01:24.959 --> 01:27.000
Oh, morning, ladies.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.041
What?
VIOLET: Nothing, nothing.

01:31.083 --> 01:33.291
I was just coming to find you.
Ready to go?

01:33.333 --> 01:38.000
Security at the prison can--
Can be a bit of a pain.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.083
( giggling )

01:45.125 --> 01:47.041
All right, look,
I know it's not sex,

01:47.083 --> 01:49.041
but come watch me
deliver a baby.

01:49.083 --> 01:50.834
Miracle of life,
always reaffirming.

01:50.875 --> 01:51.959
Always puts me
in a good mood.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.041
( elevator dings )
Sheldon?

01:53.083 --> 01:55.083
( laughing )
Really?

01:55.125 --> 01:56.959
It's always the quiet ones.

01:59.959 --> 02:01.333
( moaning and laughing )

02:05.166 --> 02:07.000
What do you think about
starting a family?

02:07.041 --> 02:08.500
Now?

02:08.542 --> 02:12.709
Not now, but soon.
We're engaged.

02:12.750 --> 02:15.667
These are the kinds of things
that engaged people discuss.

02:15.709 --> 02:19.000
How can you be thinking about
babies when we're doing this?

02:20.959 --> 02:23.041
You do know that this is how
babies get made, right?

02:23.083 --> 02:25.083
Not the way I do it.

02:25.125 --> 02:28.375
Okay. I'm serious. We--

02:28.417 --> 02:30.875
We do wanna have kids
of our own, right?

02:30.917 --> 02:32.500
Can we talk about this later?

02:34.083 --> 02:37.041
Babies are a wonderful gift.

02:37.083 --> 02:39.750
They're God's
little creatures.

02:39.792 --> 02:42.333
We should totally
discuss this later.

02:44.041 --> 02:46.208
SHELDON:
Okay, I'm seeing five inmates,
you're seeing two.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.000
You're just there
to assess the inmates,

02:48.041 --> 02:49.917
give your recommendation
to the parole board.

02:49.959 --> 02:51.208
You're not there
to make nice.

02:51.250 --> 02:52.750
So no flirting
with the inmates?

02:52.792 --> 02:55.125
You're making light, but these
are hardcore criminals, Violet.

02:55.166 --> 02:57.041
They're persuasive
and charming

02:57.083 --> 02:59.625
and good at getting you to think
that they're not criminals.

02:59.667 --> 03:03.083
So just stay on your side
of the table. Be professional.

03:03.125 --> 03:05.041
VIOLET:
Don't accept anything
from a prisoner,

03:05.083 --> 03:07.125
don't offer to do anything
for a prisoner.

03:07.166 --> 03:09.041
Relax, I read the file.
I got it.

03:09.083 --> 03:10.333
All right.

03:10.375 --> 03:13.125
I'm fine.
I'm a big girl.

03:13.166 --> 03:15.458
( groaning and panting )

03:15.500 --> 03:17.834
I love you, Tracy.
You're doing a great job.

03:17.875 --> 03:20.041
I love you too.
How are we doing?

03:20.083 --> 03:22.542
Looking good.
The baby's starting to crown.

03:22.583 --> 03:24.041
I can see her head.

03:24.083 --> 03:26.041
Oh, you hear that, honey?
You can see Kyla's head.

03:26.083 --> 03:27.667
She's gonna be beautiful
just like you.

03:27.709 --> 03:30.417
Honey, could you not
put the camera--?

03:30.458 --> 03:31.750
Please, don't film my--

03:31.792 --> 03:32.834
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

03:32.875 --> 03:34.041
Okay, you guys
are the nicest couple

03:34.083 --> 03:36.041
I have ever seen in a delivery.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.542
All right, we're almost there,
Tracy.

03:37.583 --> 03:39.041
Just one more push. Ready?

03:39.083 --> 03:40.834
Push.

03:40.875 --> 03:41.917
Good. Almost there.

03:41.959 --> 03:43.250
Here comes Kyla.

03:43.291 --> 03:44.542
( Tracy sighing )

03:48.083 --> 03:49.792
I'll get oxygen
and an intubation tray.

03:49.834 --> 03:51.542
I'll set up the ultrasound.

03:53.709 --> 03:55.667
She's not crying.
Why--? Why isn't she crying?

03:55.709 --> 03:56.875
Is something wrong?

03:56.917 --> 03:58.458
She's just having
some trouble breathing.

03:58.500 --> 04:02.250
I just wanna get her over here
and take a look.

04:02.291 --> 04:06.000
( suspenseful theme playing )

04:06.041 --> 04:07.875
ADDISON:
Tell me it's not as bad
as I think.

04:07.917 --> 04:11.000
How can someone this small
have a tumor this big?

04:13.083 --> 04:14.834
Okay, Mr. Cartwright.

04:14.875 --> 04:18.041
You have completed 40 years
of a 50-year sentence

04:18.083 --> 04:20.458
for murder
and armed robbery.

04:20.500 --> 04:24.083
Well, I guess we both know
what's in here, right?

04:24.125 --> 04:25.542
Why don't we
just talk instead?

04:25.583 --> 04:27.875
Tell me about your
rehabilitation.

04:27.917 --> 04:29.250
What do you wanna know?

04:29.291 --> 04:31.041
Do you feel changed
for the better?

04:31.083 --> 04:32.417
I'm definitely
a different man.

04:32.458 --> 04:33.625
And what about remorse?

04:33.667 --> 04:35.083
Do you feel sorry
for what you did?

04:35.125 --> 04:37.083
I think about what I did
every day.

04:37.125 --> 04:38.458
So you feel ready
for the outside,

04:38.500 --> 04:41.041
ready to rejoin society?

04:41.083 --> 04:42.375
Can I say something, ma'am?

04:43.500 --> 04:46.041
Dr. Turner.
Violet Turner.

04:46.083 --> 04:48.875
Dr. Turner,
I've been up for parole twice.

04:48.917 --> 04:50.709
And each time a therapist
just like you

04:50.750 --> 04:52.250
asks me the same list
of questions

04:52.291 --> 04:54.375
and I end up saying
what I need to say

04:54.417 --> 04:56.041
to get the result
I need to get.

04:56.083 --> 04:58.333
But you seem like a nice lady.
I'm not gonna waste your time.

04:58.375 --> 05:00.583
I'm gonna be honest with you.

05:00.625 --> 05:02.041
I'm a model prisoner.

05:02.083 --> 05:03.583
I've never had
a major write-up.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.792
I've worked in the mail room
30 years.

05:05.834 --> 05:07.917
I've co-led classes
in anger management

05:07.959 --> 05:10.041
and taught young prisoners
how to read.

05:10.083 --> 05:11.667
I'm proud of that,

05:11.709 --> 05:14.041
but I know none of that's
gonna mean anything

05:14.083 --> 05:15.709
once I get outside these walls.

05:15.750 --> 05:19.291
I've lived more of my life
locked up than free.

05:19.333 --> 05:22.041
I'm old.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.291
And if released,

05:23.333 --> 05:26.333
I'll get swallowed up
out there and I know that.

05:26.375 --> 05:29.917
But here in prison,
I feel at home.

05:29.959 --> 05:33.041
It's where my friends are,
my life is.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.667
So I'm asking you...

05:39.000 --> 05:40.959
to lie to the parole board.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
Tell them that I'm dangerous,
unremorseful, and get me denied.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.375
Do whatever you have to do,
but, please,

05:48.417 --> 05:51.083
help me stay in prison.

05:51.125 --> 05:53.750
( dramatic theme playing )

06:00.250 --> 06:01.750
It's remarkable.
And so intricate.

06:01.792 --> 06:02.875
I mean, in just ten weeks,

06:02.917 --> 06:04.250
it has partially compressed
the lung

06:04.291 --> 06:06.250
and attached
to the major vessels.

06:06.291 --> 06:08.041
Don't sound so gleeful.

06:08.083 --> 06:09.709
Well, I'm sorry, it's just...

06:11.291 --> 06:12.542
It's a beautiful tumor.

06:12.583 --> 06:15.458
Sam?
It's a pleuropulmonary blastoma.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.041
It's putting pressure
on the heart.

06:17.083 --> 06:18.166
AMELIA:
What are you gonna do?

06:18.208 --> 06:20.041
It's a 12-hour surgery
and I need some help

06:20.083 --> 06:23.041
separating it from the cardiac
vessels. You in?

06:23.083 --> 06:25.583
Yeah, sure. We should probably
get Charlotte on the horn.

06:25.625 --> 06:29.041
Start gathering the best team,
oncologist--

06:29.083 --> 06:30.917
Daniel and Tracy
were so excited.

06:30.959 --> 06:32.041
They're like the perfect couple.

06:32.083 --> 06:35.041
I just hate
to shatter their world.

06:35.083 --> 06:38.041
Well, that's the thing
about perfect.

06:38.083 --> 06:40.000
Doesn't exist.

06:47.667 --> 06:48.709
How was convict day?

06:48.750 --> 06:50.250
Convict day?

06:50.291 --> 06:52.875
Talking to prisoners about their
parole. You know, with Sheldon?

06:52.917 --> 06:54.041
The state gives us a bundle.

06:54.083 --> 06:56.041
Do you listen when I talk to you
in the morning?

06:56.083 --> 06:58.208
I do. I listen closely.

06:58.250 --> 07:01.458
You never said anything about
working with convicts.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.625
Oh, well, I don't know.
Maybe I forgot.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.917
Anyway, the point is
that my prisoner wants me

07:05.959 --> 07:09.333
to lie to the parole board
and have him denied.

07:09.375 --> 07:11.041
He wants to stay in prison.

07:11.083 --> 07:12.625
Why?

07:12.667 --> 07:14.041
He's old. It's home.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.667
Good. You're done. Case closed.

07:15.709 --> 07:18.083
No, not-- Not done.
Not closed.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.333
How can I just leave a man
in prison?

07:20.375 --> 07:21.500
Just let him
stay in a system

07:21.542 --> 07:23.500
when he clearly
doesn't belong there.

07:23.542 --> 07:25.500
Doesn't this strike you
as so, so sad?

07:25.542 --> 07:27.917
Not really.
Why is everyone here so callous?

07:27.959 --> 07:30.083
Everyone's not--
We gave Betsey away.

07:30.125 --> 07:32.875
Dell's child.
Our dead friend's child.

07:32.917 --> 07:34.625
We put her in the system too.

07:34.667 --> 07:36.250
This isn't about Betsey.

07:36.291 --> 07:39.375
I know.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.875
So, what is your problem?

07:40.917 --> 07:43.917
You're my wife,
the mother of my child.

07:43.959 --> 07:46.041
You were brutally attacked
by someone

07:46.083 --> 07:47.125
who is now in the system.

07:47.166 --> 07:50.291
So forgive me if I feel
a little callous.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.333
Forgive me for caring.

07:52.375 --> 07:55.375
( tense theme playing )

08:03.333 --> 08:04.750
You should feel like crap.

08:04.792 --> 08:06.208
Oh, shut up.

08:07.625 --> 08:09.709
What do you think about me
and Charlotte having kids?

08:09.750 --> 08:10.834
Is Charlotte pregnant?

08:10.875 --> 08:12.083
No.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.125
Uh, but, you know,
she will be one day and...

08:14.166 --> 08:16.709
We'd have cute kids, right?

08:16.750 --> 08:17.959
So now you want a child?

08:19.250 --> 08:20.625
This really
isn't about Betsey.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.125
Okay, fine.

08:25.166 --> 08:28.750
Well, uh, does Charlotte feel
like she's ready to be a mother?

08:28.792 --> 08:31.375
We're, um, still talking.

08:31.417 --> 08:34.291
Good. That's good.

08:34.333 --> 08:35.542
Yeah.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.291
Wow, Charlotte with kids.

08:37.333 --> 08:39.041
I never thought, um...

08:39.083 --> 08:42.208
Well, that's good
that you're talking.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.041
Isn't she too young
for surgery?

08:48.083 --> 08:50.959
The surgery is risky.
Every surgery is.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.875
But we've got the best surgical
team assembled

08:52.917 --> 08:55.041
and I'm confident
about their abilities.

08:55.083 --> 08:57.208
Uh, Dr. Rodriguez,
meet Dr. Addison Montgomery.

08:57.250 --> 08:58.875
How do you do?

08:58.917 --> 09:00.500
CHARLOTTE:
Daniel and Tracy Woods.

09:00.542 --> 09:02.125
Dr. Rodriguez is the oncologist.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.166
He'll be part of the team
working to treat Kyla.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.041
I know this is a rough time
for you,

09:06.083 --> 09:09.041
but we're going to do everything
in our power to save your baby.

09:09.083 --> 09:10.458
CHARLOTTE:
You're actually on time.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.000
We were just discussing
surgery.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.458
Surgery?

09:13.500 --> 09:16.041
Have you discussed chemo
as an alternative to surgery?

09:16.083 --> 09:18.083
Yes, but I believe surgery
will be more effective.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.667
Only if she survives.

09:19.709 --> 09:22.291
Chemo's better than surgery?
RODRIGUEZ: In my opinion.

09:22.333 --> 09:25.250
Based on the CT,
Kyla has a Type Two PPB tumor.

09:25.291 --> 09:26.667
Chemo is the treatment
of choice.

09:26.709 --> 09:28.083
It's less invasive and risky.

09:28.125 --> 09:29.709
I disagree.
I've seen the CT too.

09:29.750 --> 09:32.875
I believe that Kyla
has a classic Type One tumor.

09:32.917 --> 09:34.625
Removing the tumor
will cure her.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.667
I can tell you about
the advantages of chemo.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.000
Excuse me--

09:38.041 --> 09:40.083
Maybe we should
step outside, doctors.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.875
If you two wanna gunsling,
do it out here,

09:46.917 --> 09:48.250
not in front of the family.

09:48.291 --> 09:50.291
Chemo is the standard,
proven method of treatment.

09:50.333 --> 09:51.750
You'd say that.
You're a cancer doc.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.041
Chemo is all you do.

09:53.083 --> 09:55.041
Of course you'd go against it.
You're a surgeon.

09:55.083 --> 09:56.083
Cutting is all you do.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.083
The goal here is to figure out
what makes sense,

09:58.125 --> 09:59.834
not argue.
No way is it necessary

09:59.875 --> 10:02.959
to do surgery now when there's
another viable, safer option.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.500
It's safer to put a baby through
months and months of chemo

10:05.542 --> 10:07.041
and watch it suffer?
That's safer?

10:07.083 --> 10:09.291
If we can reduce the mass
and shrink the cancer cells,

10:09.333 --> 10:11.041
it will make doing the surgery
later easier.

10:11.083 --> 10:13.083
There's no guarantee chemo
is gonna remove the tumor.

10:13.125 --> 10:15.333
Guarantee that with surgery?
Yes, I can,

10:15.375 --> 10:16.750
or I wouldn't be standing here.

10:16.792 --> 10:18.041
We don't make guarantees.

10:18.083 --> 10:20.250
One surgery cures this baby

10:20.291 --> 10:22.834
and she never has to see
a hospital again.

10:22.875 --> 10:25.041
And you get to be the hero.
Yes, Dr. Rodriguez.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.583
That's usually how it goes.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.500
You're the chief.
It's your call.

10:29.542 --> 10:31.709
The parents have obviously
put their trust

10:31.750 --> 10:33.917
in Dr. Montgomery's judgment.
So have I.

10:33.959 --> 10:35.500
We're doing the surgery.
DANIEL: Help!

10:36.959 --> 10:40.291
We need help in here.
Something's wrong with Tracy.

10:40.333 --> 10:42.917
She's hemorrhaging.
I need two large-bore IVs

10:42.959 --> 10:44.250
and an LR wide open.
I'll get them.

10:44.291 --> 10:46.375
Pulse is racing.
She's hypertensive.

10:46.417 --> 10:49.000
Type and cross two units.
And I need an O.R. now.

10:52.542 --> 10:54.542
It was a postpartum hemorrhage.
It happens.

10:54.583 --> 10:57.000
I was able to control
the bleeding.

10:57.041 --> 10:59.667
She'll wake up soon.
We just have to give her time.

11:04.041 --> 11:06.417
You date,
you get married.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.792
You never even think
that something bad might happen.

11:09.834 --> 11:12.417
We've never had any kind
of problems and now...

11:14.542 --> 11:17.750
Now my entire family's in danger
and they're depending on me.

11:20.208 --> 11:22.500
What am I supposed to do?
You sit down and you wait

11:22.542 --> 11:25.542
for your wife to wake up,
because she will.

11:25.583 --> 11:28.000
And then you let me take care
of Kyla.

11:41.291 --> 11:43.000
SHELDON:
What are you gonna do?

11:44.083 --> 11:46.041
I don't know.
Violet, you can't--

11:46.083 --> 11:49.041
I know, I know. It's just...

11:49.083 --> 11:51.458
Lewis has been locked up
for four decades.

11:51.500 --> 11:54.041
He doesn't have any family,
doesn't have any support system.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.458
He's got no one.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.667
This isn't about Betsey.

11:56.709 --> 11:59.792
I know.
Why does everyone keep--?

11:59.834 --> 12:01.041
I know.
Do you?

12:01.083 --> 12:04.041
How is he gonna make
a new life for himself

12:04.083 --> 12:05.625
after being locked up
for so long?

12:05.667 --> 12:09.041
I mean, he went to prison
in 1970. Nixon was president.

12:09.083 --> 12:12.583
There were no computers or cell
phones or freaking microwaves.

12:12.625 --> 12:16.041
Prisoners reenter society
every day. They don't all fail.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.041
You know?
He could make it.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.875
But how are people
gonna treat him?

12:18.917 --> 12:20.625
You tell someone
you've done time in prison,

12:20.667 --> 12:22.041
I don't care
how liberal they are.

12:22.083 --> 12:24.041
They walk the other way.
Lewis is a man.

12:24.083 --> 12:25.291
A man who made a mistake.

12:25.333 --> 12:27.667
But he owes it to himself to
get out there and make a life.

12:27.709 --> 12:29.458
And he deserves a chance
to do that,

12:29.500 --> 12:30.583
even if he doesn't want to.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.208
I have to get to the prison,

12:32.250 --> 12:34.208
talk to the board.
Violet,

12:34.250 --> 12:36.041
I'm gonna say the same thing
I said about Betsey.

12:36.083 --> 12:38.041
Don't lose
all your objectivity.

12:38.083 --> 12:41.375
Don't get attached.
Just do what you know is right.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.083
Is she awake yet?
Not yet.

12:45.125 --> 12:47.333
But Daniel still wants
to go ahead with Kyla's surgery,

12:47.375 --> 12:49.041
so we're gonna do it.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.250
Oh, Daniel, I was just coming
to talk to you.

12:51.291 --> 12:52.500
This is Dr. Sam Bennett.

12:52.542 --> 12:54.041
He'll be assisting me
with the surgery.

12:54.083 --> 12:57.250
Well, actually that won't be
necessary anymore.

12:57.291 --> 12:59.041
See, I spoke with that
oncologist again

12:59.083 --> 13:02.041
and I'm going with the chemo.

13:02.083 --> 13:04.041
Daniel, you have every right
to change your mind,

13:04.083 --> 13:06.041
but I really think
that this is a decision

13:06.083 --> 13:07.709
that you and Tracy
need to make together.

13:07.750 --> 13:10.041
My wife is unconscious
and my baby has a tumor.

13:10.083 --> 13:12.250
So I'm not into
taking any risks right now.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.500
So no, I made the decision
for us both.

13:14.542 --> 13:16.041
I think Trac--
Dr. Montgomery,

13:16.083 --> 13:17.333
I won't be needing
your opinion.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.709
Dr. King knows about this.
She gave me her full support.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.041
So you can
stay out of it for now.

13:21.083 --> 13:24.000
( tense theme playing )

13:29.333 --> 13:30.625
Thank you.

13:36.417 --> 13:39.875
Great. No messages.

13:39.917 --> 13:41.375
Any of your patients
need brain surgery?

13:41.417 --> 13:43.500
Nope.
( sighs )

13:45.125 --> 13:48.166
You used to date Sheldon.

13:48.208 --> 13:52.041
Date is strong word.
I used to screw Sheldon.

13:52.083 --> 13:54.583
And would you recommend him?

13:59.625 --> 14:01.875
And he knows
what to do with it.

14:10.458 --> 14:13.125
Morning.
Afternoon.

14:16.959 --> 14:18.625
There's plenty of coffee
in the kitchen.

14:18.667 --> 14:20.000
You don't
have to go downstairs.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.125
We should work together.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.458
I've heard about your skills.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.667
I bet you could
teach me something.

14:26.709 --> 14:29.291
You're talking
about therapy?

14:30.458 --> 14:32.834
And other things.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.333
Did you see that?

14:38.375 --> 14:40.041
What?
Amelia.

14:40.083 --> 14:41.875
She was checking me out
like a piece of meat.

14:41.917 --> 14:44.041
Amelia is young
and hot and, uh...

14:44.083 --> 14:45.458
That's a lot of woman.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.417
Yeah, well,
I can get women, Cooper.

14:47.458 --> 14:50.417
I didn't--
I've had lots of women.

14:50.458 --> 14:52.041
Just saying.
I can handle it.

14:52.083 --> 14:55.000
Okay. Excuse me.

15:03.041 --> 15:04.083
Where the hell is the coffee?

15:04.125 --> 15:05.375
Just talk to Charlotte.

15:05.417 --> 15:06.792
Maybe she can explain.

15:06.834 --> 15:08.625
What's with all the noise?

15:08.667 --> 15:10.834
So from complete faith in me
to totally shutting me out?

15:10.875 --> 15:12.834
What did you do?
Did you lock the dad in the room

15:12.875 --> 15:14.917
with that jackass oncologist
so he could convince him

15:14.959 --> 15:16.667
to do the chemo
while Tracy's unconscious?

15:16.709 --> 15:17.792
CHARLOTTE:
Are you done?

15:17.834 --> 15:19.875
Because once you stop talking,
I can.

15:19.917 --> 15:22.083
Who wins, Venus or Serena?
BOTH: Shut up, Cooper.

15:22.125 --> 15:24.625
First, I don't have to explain
anything to you.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.917
It's my hospital.
I do what I want.

15:26.959 --> 15:29.250
Second, my responsibility
is to the parents.

15:29.291 --> 15:31.750
And the baby,
the actual patient here.

15:31.792 --> 15:33.208
I'm not done talking.

15:33.250 --> 15:35.834
Third, the man's been holding
vigil by his wife's bedside

15:35.875 --> 15:37.083
while his baby
lays in an incubator.

15:37.125 --> 15:39.083
He didn't need
much convincing.

15:39.125 --> 15:41.333
Although you wanna believe
big bad bitch Charlotte

15:41.375 --> 15:43.208
shut everything down,
I didn't.

15:43.250 --> 15:46.750
One parent made a decision and
I am obligated to enforce it.

15:46.792 --> 15:48.542
Which means the father
has spoken,

15:48.583 --> 15:51.041
the surgery is off
and I am done with this.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.250
Oh, you know what, Charlotte?
I'm not done.

15:53.291 --> 15:56.000
Let her go. Breathe.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.917
Lewis is 70,
but his life is not over.

16:10.959 --> 16:15.041
He is smart. He is strong.
He can make it.

16:15.083 --> 16:17.375
There is life outside of prison

16:17.417 --> 16:19.500
and Lewis should
be a part of it.

16:19.542 --> 16:22.625
I believe he is ready
to be a part of it.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.750
Lewis Cartwright
is not a threat to society.

16:25.792 --> 16:28.959
In fact, if released, I believe
he'd be a model citizen.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.333
( dramatic theme playing )

16:39.333 --> 16:41.000
( buzzer sounds )

17:01.083 --> 17:03.667
( lock buzzes )

17:10.083 --> 17:11.041
What are you doing here?

17:11.083 --> 17:13.458
I'm here to help.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.000
You've done enough, thanks.

17:17.083 --> 17:19.000
Lewis, please, hear me out.

17:23.083 --> 17:26.000
Who is Addison to be questioning
my motives anyway?

17:26.041 --> 17:28.041
What, is she
the motive police?

17:28.083 --> 17:29.667
I don't have to explain
anything to her.

17:29.709 --> 17:32.250
I mean, last time I checked,
my mama lived in Alabama.

17:33.709 --> 17:35.041
What?

17:35.083 --> 17:37.000
I'm just waiting
for you to finish.

17:39.083 --> 17:40.667
Say what's on your mind,
Cooper.

17:40.709 --> 17:43.041
You don't fight fair.

17:43.083 --> 17:45.166
You don't listen
to the other side, Charlotte.

17:45.208 --> 17:47.709
You don't hear people out,
you don't answer questions.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.291
When you wanna
get out of something--

17:49.333 --> 17:51.667
What are you talking about?
With Addison, you just walk away

17:51.709 --> 17:53.250
and with me, you use sex.

17:53.291 --> 17:56.041
You have a problem with that?
Yes!

17:56.083 --> 17:58.041
No.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.417
Yes, we are engaged

17:59.458 --> 18:02.917
and having a discussion
about children is important.

18:02.959 --> 18:05.041
In my mind, I asked you
a pretty simple question

18:05.083 --> 18:06.792
that you don't wanna answer.

18:06.834 --> 18:09.041
I told you we'd discuss it
later. What's the big damn deal?

18:09.083 --> 18:10.041
Why? Why later?

18:10.083 --> 18:12.291
No! See, this is what
I'm talking about.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.458
Okay, I'm gonna finish this.
You can't dig your heels in

18:14.500 --> 18:16.083
when you don't like
the conversation,

18:16.125 --> 18:17.750
say "later," and walk away.

18:19.083 --> 18:21.875
Yeah. At least I finished.

18:26.125 --> 18:28.667
What happened to just coffee?

18:28.709 --> 18:30.542
Everything's fancier now.

18:30.583 --> 18:34.208
I haven't had to choose
what to eat in 40 years.

18:34.250 --> 18:37.250
You know, if it helps, I usually
narrow it down to two choices

18:37.291 --> 18:41.125
and then I just choose one
from there.

18:41.166 --> 18:42.417
I'll have eggs and bacon.

18:42.458 --> 18:43.792
( cell phone ringing )

18:45.291 --> 18:46.291
Do you have
a place to live?

18:46.333 --> 18:47.792
I got the name
of a probation officer

18:47.834 --> 18:50.041
who's gonna set me up
at a halfway house.

18:50.083 --> 18:52.166
The prison gave me
two pairs of pants and a shirt

18:52.208 --> 18:54.083
and a couple hundred bucks.

18:54.125 --> 18:56.500
I'm thinking it's not enough,
but it's a start.

19:06.333 --> 19:08.875
I-- I made some calls too,
and I found a job for you.

19:08.917 --> 19:11.041
It's just something
part-time at a car wash

19:11.083 --> 19:12.333
until you get
back on your feet.

19:12.375 --> 19:14.041
What do I owe you?
Nothing.

19:14.083 --> 19:16.041
That's not the way it works
where I come from.

19:16.083 --> 19:18.041
Somebody do you a favor,
they expect one back.

19:18.083 --> 19:20.750
Well, that world
is behind you now.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.291
( cell phone ringing )
You're a free man.

19:22.333 --> 19:24.291
( sighs )

19:24.333 --> 19:27.125
LEWIS:
I feel like I've been dropped
into some foreign country

19:27.166 --> 19:29.166
and I should speak the language,
but I don't.

19:29.208 --> 19:31.959
It's gonna take a while
to adjust, Lewis.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.709
But you will.

19:33.750 --> 19:36.291
Come see me.

19:36.333 --> 19:40.333
We can work together
to help you to transition.

19:40.375 --> 19:43.709
Okay? I can help you make it,
Lewis.

19:43.750 --> 19:47.125
( tense theme playing )

20:00.250 --> 20:01.959
I'm here to do
a repeat blood count.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
We start chemo
in the morning.

20:06.083 --> 20:08.041
She's all yours.
I know this isn't your choice,

20:08.083 --> 20:10.041
but I really think
it's going to work.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.041
Doesn't matter
what you think.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.667
Daniel and Tracy came in
thinking

20:13.709 --> 20:15.709
they were gonna have
a healthy baby and they didn't.

20:19.583 --> 20:21.291
Now everything's a mess.

20:23.083 --> 20:26.041
I didn't peg you
as a pessimist.

20:26.083 --> 20:27.250
What?

20:30.667 --> 20:34.667
Last month, I had to tell
three families about relapses.

20:34.709 --> 20:36.875
I lost my favorite patient.

20:36.917 --> 20:40.000
But then there was
this one woman with lymphoma

20:40.041 --> 20:41.417
who walked out
of those doors.

20:41.458 --> 20:45.834
That's how it happens. You focus
on the good, on the one.

20:45.875 --> 20:48.875
Not on the bad.

20:51.542 --> 20:54.083
( door slides open )

20:54.125 --> 20:55.667
Tracy Woods. She's awake.

21:05.083 --> 21:06.625
I have two highs.

21:06.667 --> 21:08.458
Cutting into people's brains
and sex.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.125
When I can't have one,
I search for the other.

21:11.166 --> 21:14.000
And right now nobody's brain
needs cutting into.

21:16.667 --> 21:18.041
You're propositioning me
for sex?

21:18.083 --> 21:19.458
Yeah.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.083
( chuckles )

21:22.583 --> 21:24.041
I'll think about it.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.667
Excuse me?

21:25.709 --> 21:27.792
I'll think about it.

21:42.417 --> 21:45.375
I wanna see Kyla.

21:45.417 --> 21:46.792
How is she?

21:46.834 --> 21:48.750
She's doing as well
as can be expected.

21:48.792 --> 21:51.750
Tracy, I wanted to talk to you
about the surgery.

21:51.792 --> 21:53.166
Did you already do it?

21:53.208 --> 21:54.458
Daniel didn't tell you?

21:54.500 --> 21:55.917
Tell me what?

21:55.959 --> 21:57.417
DANIEL:
Honey, I called the family and--

21:58.834 --> 21:59.750
What are you doing here?

21:59.792 --> 22:02.000
She's our doctor.

22:02.041 --> 22:04.166
Daniel decided
to go with the chemo.

22:04.208 --> 22:05.667
Chemo?

22:05.709 --> 22:08.917
But Dr. Montgomery said
she could remove the tumor.

22:08.959 --> 22:12.917
Maybe. Honey, maybe she can
remove the whole tumor.

22:12.959 --> 22:14.500
All right, that oncologist,

22:14.542 --> 22:17.041
he told me that Kyla
is too weak for surgery.

22:17.083 --> 22:18.583
And-- And you agree with this?

22:18.625 --> 22:20.083
No, I don't.

22:20.125 --> 22:23.041
You can't just make
this decision without me.

22:23.083 --> 22:25.500
You know, I just don't want
our baby to die.

22:25.542 --> 22:27.083
And I do? I'm her mother.

22:27.125 --> 22:28.166
Yeah, and I'm her father.

22:28.208 --> 22:30.125
Okay, the time
that you waste arguing

22:30.166 --> 22:32.083
is time that Kyla
is not being treated.

22:32.125 --> 22:34.625
You need to make a decision.
What do you both wanna do?

22:34.667 --> 22:36.166
I told you, the chemo.

22:36.208 --> 22:37.583
No. No.

22:37.625 --> 22:39.583
( tense theme playing )

22:49.083 --> 22:51.041
Look, there's only two ways
for this to end.

22:51.083 --> 22:52.542
Either one of them
goes to court

22:52.583 --> 22:55.041
and gets medical
power of attorney or...

22:55.083 --> 22:57.834
Or we get them
on the same page.

22:57.875 --> 23:01.083
Okay, well, I can try
and talk to Daniel.

23:01.125 --> 23:02.333
( sighs )

23:02.375 --> 23:03.834
What?

23:03.875 --> 23:06.041
Nothing.

23:06.083 --> 23:08.375
Have I told you how beautiful
you look in the morning?

23:13.750 --> 23:17.667
Okay, okay. Enough with the lips
and the hands.

23:17.709 --> 23:19.500
Okay.

23:19.542 --> 23:20.500
You're freaking out and--

23:20.542 --> 23:23.041
If you touch me,
I can't think.

23:23.083 --> 23:25.458
You're too sexy.
Just be ugly or something.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.834
Ugh, woman.

23:26.875 --> 23:28.917
Okay, look, I know...

23:28.959 --> 23:30.834
All right,
I'm just gonna say this.

23:30.875 --> 23:33.208
And I know that it's gonna make
me sound like a crazy woman,

23:33.250 --> 23:37.667
but us, you, me, the Addisam,
you know, it's just not...

23:37.709 --> 23:39.000
( sighs )

23:41.250 --> 23:43.417
All right.

23:43.458 --> 23:46.583
Usually in a relationship,

23:46.625 --> 23:49.709
I can see ahead and see
how things are gonna go wrong.

23:49.750 --> 23:52.667
You know, I'm usually five
moves ahead or 15 moves ahead

23:52.709 --> 23:54.083
and I can see
where it's gonna fall apart

23:54.125 --> 23:56.041
or where the guy
is gonna disappoint me

23:56.083 --> 23:59.083
or where he's gonna break
my heart or--

23:59.125 --> 24:03.208
But you're perfect.
You have no flaws.

24:03.250 --> 24:06.417
And I can't see ahead
and it's making me crazy.

24:06.458 --> 24:08.291
Nothing is going
to break us up.

24:08.333 --> 24:11.041
Don't say that. That's perfect.
You just said the perfect thing.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.083
Daniel and Tracy
thought that.

24:13.125 --> 24:16.041
Now they're ripping each other
apart over their baby.

24:16.083 --> 24:17.875
What do you want me to say?
I don't know.

24:17.917 --> 24:20.041
Just try not to be perfect.

24:20.083 --> 24:23.375
Okay. Ahem. How about this?
I'm not perfect.

24:23.417 --> 24:27.000
I'm just perfect for you.

24:29.375 --> 24:31.041
( both chuckle )

24:31.083 --> 24:32.542
See?

24:32.583 --> 24:34.125
Now I'm gonna have to tear
your clothes off

24:34.166 --> 24:35.667
and have my way with you.

24:35.709 --> 24:39.041
Because that was the exact
perfect thing.

24:39.083 --> 24:40.500
Okay.

24:45.834 --> 24:47.875
Sheldon turned me down
for sex.

24:47.917 --> 24:50.250
I figured he would feel like
he won the lotto.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.166
Instead he looks me straight
in the face and says--

24:52.208 --> 24:53.917
"I'll think about it."

24:53.959 --> 24:55.583
How did you know?
Wild guess.

24:55.625 --> 24:56.792
It's probably not as good

24:56.834 --> 24:58.125
as I think it's gonna be anyway,
so...

24:58.166 --> 25:00.583
( elevator dinging )
It is.

25:00.625 --> 25:02.166
It's better.

25:04.083 --> 25:05.041
Damn it.

25:05.083 --> 25:07.583
The whole,
"Let me think about it"?

25:07.625 --> 25:09.291
That's pure Sheldon.
That's his game.

25:09.333 --> 25:12.208
And from looking at you,
it's working like a charm.

25:16.375 --> 25:18.333
Hey.
Hey.

25:18.375 --> 25:19.917
What you looking for?

25:19.959 --> 25:23.500
He hasn't called.
Who?

25:23.542 --> 25:26.959
Lewis, the parolee.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
I told him to come see me.
I hoped he would call.

25:30.083 --> 25:32.667
I'm worried.
He's out there by himself.

25:32.709 --> 25:35.458
Well, I'm sure he has access to
people, resources who can help.

25:35.500 --> 25:38.250
Okay, look, I--
I know you don't like the idea

25:38.291 --> 25:40.417
of me working with a prisoner
because of Katie,

25:40.458 --> 25:42.834
but I'm good.
I'm not afraid.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.333
So worry about Lewis,
not about me.

25:44.375 --> 25:45.458
He's a murderer, Violet.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.208
And that means--?

25:47.250 --> 25:49.542
He can't be rehabilitated.
How could you even say that?

25:49.583 --> 25:51.959
My life's work is based on the
belief that people can change.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.041
I see it every day.

25:53.083 --> 25:54.875
I say this out of concern
for you.

25:54.917 --> 25:56.250
Don't get involved.

25:56.291 --> 25:58.792
The world's a better place
without people like Lewis.

25:58.834 --> 26:00.542
Okay, I know you're trying
to take care of me,

26:00.583 --> 26:02.041
but this is pissing me off.

26:02.083 --> 26:05.083
We care. That's our job.
That's who we are.

26:05.125 --> 26:08.041
And this,
what you're saying right now,

26:08.083 --> 26:10.000
it doesn't even sound like you.

26:16.083 --> 26:18.000
( infant crying )

26:27.083 --> 26:29.291
DANIEL:
This will be Kyla one day,
right?

26:29.333 --> 26:32.667
Happy, healthy.
Yeah, we hope.

26:37.917 --> 26:40.458
My baby's lying in an incubator
with a big tumor in her body

26:40.500 --> 26:41.750
and we're out here fighting.

26:43.792 --> 26:48.458
If Kyla doesn't make it,

26:48.500 --> 26:50.083
Tracy's not gonna be able
to live with that,

26:50.125 --> 26:51.542
and I cannot lose them both.

26:51.583 --> 26:52.750
You don't have to.

26:52.792 --> 26:53.875
That's easy for you to say.

26:53.917 --> 26:56.417
Actually it's not.

26:56.458 --> 26:58.125
I know why you wanna
make the safe choice.

26:58.166 --> 27:00.208
No parent wants
to see their child

27:00.250 --> 27:04.041
go behind those operating room
doors and not come out alive.

27:04.083 --> 27:07.291
The waiting feels like
it's gonna kill you.

27:09.083 --> 27:11.041
But there comes a time
when you need

27:11.083 --> 27:14.000
to put your trust
in each other

27:14.041 --> 27:18.291
and make a decision together
as parents.

27:18.333 --> 27:19.542
Right or wrong.

27:23.208 --> 27:26.375
You want that,
do the surgery.

27:41.083 --> 27:42.583
If I stop, I'll get fired.

27:42.625 --> 27:43.917
I-- I hadn't heard from you

27:43.959 --> 27:45.709
and I just wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

27:45.750 --> 27:47.542
I'm making it.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.709
I gave you my card
and I was hoping that--

27:50.750 --> 27:52.625
I tossed it.
Hey, look, I'm working here.

27:52.667 --> 27:54.291
Lewis, I'm sorry.
I'm not here to harass you.

27:54.333 --> 27:55.291
I just wanted to--

27:55.333 --> 27:57.625
Help? You said that.

27:57.667 --> 27:59.458
Look, I don't need a handout.

28:01.041 --> 28:03.333
Well, how about a hand up?

28:03.375 --> 28:05.750
Look, I--

28:05.792 --> 28:08.041
I've been through things myself
and I know how hard it can be.

28:08.083 --> 28:10.291
So I just-- I want you to know
that I mean it.

28:10.333 --> 28:11.959
Here. Keep it this time.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.041
Leave and don't come back.

28:14.083 --> 28:17.041
But--
You don't know me.

28:17.083 --> 28:19.458
I could do things to you to make
you regret you ever met me.

28:19.500 --> 28:20.875
So for your own good,

28:20.917 --> 28:23.750
I would leave and stay
as far away from me as possible.

28:23.792 --> 28:27.250
( dramatic theme playing )

28:35.458 --> 28:37.166
( Cooper beeping )

28:37.208 --> 28:39.041
( growling )

28:39.083 --> 28:40.583
( mellow pop music playing )

28:40.625 --> 28:42.000
( Lucas chattering )

28:44.000 --> 28:45.458
Why do you have my child?

28:45.500 --> 28:47.583
I hijacked him
from the nanny.

28:47.625 --> 28:49.417
God, he's growing.

28:49.458 --> 28:52.000
( Lucas shouts )
( Cooper mimics shouting )

28:54.458 --> 28:56.250
I think I might
have messed up with Lewis.

28:56.291 --> 28:58.041
Who's that, the prison guy?
Why do you say that?

28:58.083 --> 29:00.333
He threatened me.

29:00.375 --> 29:02.041
And that is just
between you and me, okay?

29:02.083 --> 29:05.041
Pete saying "I told you so"
is not what I need right now.

29:05.083 --> 29:07.041
Yeah, but you need to walk away.
You've done enough.

29:07.083 --> 29:08.667
Let the guy
make his own way.

29:08.709 --> 29:09.709
I am. I'm done.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.041
( sighs )

29:13.083 --> 29:15.291
You think I wanna save this guy
because I couldn't save Betsey?

29:15.333 --> 29:17.291
Do you?

29:22.709 --> 29:24.125
It's like looking
into the sun.

29:25.917 --> 29:27.041
So gorgeous it hurts.

29:29.250 --> 29:32.125
Charlotte is acting weird
about the baby thing.

29:32.166 --> 29:34.041
What if she never wants kids?

29:34.083 --> 29:36.041
Well, you can hijack Lucas
whenever you want.

29:36.083 --> 29:37.208
Preferably Friday nights,

29:37.250 --> 29:39.083
so I can have sex
with my hot cranky husband.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.208
( gagging )

29:40.250 --> 29:42.041
Don't talk about sex
in front of the kid.

29:42.083 --> 29:43.500
He'll end up impotent.

29:43.542 --> 29:46.041
Or I will.

29:46.083 --> 29:48.000
Motherhood is scary.

29:50.083 --> 29:51.625
She'll come around.

29:54.458 --> 29:55.875
ADDISON:
The tumor is even larger

29:55.917 --> 29:58.542
and more intertwined
than on the CT.

29:58.583 --> 30:01.041
SAM:
Maybe debulk as best you can
and get out for now.

30:01.083 --> 30:03.750
ADDISON:
No. I promised I could get it.

30:05.083 --> 30:06.500
Metz.
NURSE: Here you go.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.750
SAM:
Whoa. The tumor invaded
the artery. It perfed.

30:10.792 --> 30:13.542
ADDISON:
Satinsky. I need to clamp
the vessel.

30:16.083 --> 30:17.041
I can't get it.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.667
( EKG flatlining )

30:18.709 --> 30:20.417
She's hypovolemic.
We lost her pulse.

30:36.083 --> 30:37.208
We got the whole tumor.

30:37.250 --> 30:39.041
It's gone?
Yes.

30:39.083 --> 30:41.041
Her lung is fine
and so is her heart.

30:41.083 --> 30:43.083
( both laughing )

30:43.125 --> 30:45.250
Would you like
to see Kyla now?

30:46.625 --> 30:47.875
Yes, please.

31:18.583 --> 31:21.041
In and out.
That was my plan.

31:21.083 --> 31:23.625
I was just gonna
go in the store,

31:23.667 --> 31:27.041
hit the register,
get some cash.

31:27.083 --> 31:29.208
I never expected anything
to go wrong.

31:29.250 --> 31:31.041
But when she saw my gun,

31:31.083 --> 31:32.959
she started screaming
and screaming.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.208
I knew she'd remember my face,
so I shot her.

31:36.250 --> 31:39.458
Twice in the stomach.

31:39.500 --> 31:43.250
I didn't even wait for
her body to drop. I just ran.

31:43.291 --> 31:47.041
She was a college girl
on her way home from school.

31:47.083 --> 31:49.792
Just stopped for gas.

31:49.834 --> 31:52.875
Stephanie was her name.

31:52.917 --> 31:55.291
And I wonder all the time,

31:55.333 --> 31:58.458
what would she be doing
with her life right now?

31:58.500 --> 32:03.625
Would she be married?
Have kids? A nice job?

32:03.667 --> 32:09.041
And because she died,

32:09.083 --> 32:12.291
you don't feel like you

32:12.333 --> 32:14.583
deserve to live your life.

32:18.333 --> 32:20.625
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm sorry I did that.

32:20.667 --> 32:23.041
It's just that
I don't deserve anyone's help.

32:23.083 --> 32:24.959
Everybody deserves help, Lewis.

32:27.709 --> 32:29.041
I killed someone.

32:29.083 --> 32:31.250
And you feel like
you can't forgive yourself.

32:31.291 --> 32:33.834
And I can never
repay it either.

32:33.875 --> 32:36.250
Forty years in prison,
that's enough.

32:36.291 --> 32:37.875
Is it?

32:37.917 --> 32:39.041
It has to be.

32:39.083 --> 32:43.709
If I enjoy a cup of coffee,
I feel guilty now.

32:43.750 --> 32:48.083
If I just sit on a park bench
and watch the trees blow,

32:48.125 --> 32:51.041
I feel guilty
about that too.

32:51.083 --> 32:53.250
And now that I'm free,

32:53.291 --> 32:57.709
if I lose myself
in a good moment, I feel bad.

32:57.750 --> 33:00.166
But think about all the good
things that you've done.

33:00.208 --> 33:02.792
All the ways that you've tried
to make amends.

33:02.834 --> 33:05.291
And you've done this
all the while knowing

33:05.333 --> 33:07.375
that you can never really pay
for what you did.

33:07.417 --> 33:10.750
You helped
other prisoners.

33:10.792 --> 33:12.709
You never caused trouble
for anyone else.

33:12.750 --> 33:14.667
You got an education.

33:14.709 --> 33:16.083
You didn't just sit there
and do time.

33:16.125 --> 33:18.709
You made something of it.

33:18.750 --> 33:22.250
You went into prison
and you came out a better man.

33:25.542 --> 33:28.000
It's okay to live, Lewis.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.000
Live.

33:36.959 --> 33:38.166
( sighs )

33:42.792 --> 33:44.917
Hey, Lewis was here.

33:44.959 --> 33:47.500
We had therapy
and he had a breakthrough.

33:47.542 --> 33:49.333
I believe he thinks
he can make it now.

33:49.375 --> 33:52.041
That's great, Violet,
but be careful.

33:52.083 --> 33:54.041
Everybody doesn't respond
to therapy.

33:54.083 --> 33:56.375
Great. First Pete and now you.
Pete?

33:56.417 --> 33:58.875
He has some issue with me
working in the prison.

33:58.917 --> 34:02.500
Oh. Violet.
I can come back later.

34:09.417 --> 34:10.750
What was that?

34:10.792 --> 34:13.166
Psychology and brain surgery
are symbiotic disciplines

34:13.208 --> 34:15.458
and we were thinking
about working, um--

34:17.417 --> 34:19.542
Okay, I'm not a good liar.

34:19.583 --> 34:20.959
Amelia propositioned me
for sex

34:21.000 --> 34:23.625
and I haven't been able
to give her an answer.

34:23.667 --> 34:25.834
Ooh. What do you think
is holding you back?

34:25.875 --> 34:29.041
Amelia and I have said
eight words to each other

34:29.083 --> 34:30.583
since she joined
the practice.

34:30.625 --> 34:32.333
Why me?

34:33.458 --> 34:35.917
( chuckles )

34:35.959 --> 34:37.667
Nice, Violet. Real nice.

34:37.709 --> 34:39.667
You've been sharing stories
with the class.

34:39.709 --> 34:40.917
Oh, come on.

34:40.959 --> 34:44.208
For most men, this would be
like a badge of honor.

35:02.250 --> 35:03.500
She made it.

35:03.542 --> 35:05.208
She made it.

35:05.250 --> 35:07.208
Congratulations.

35:07.250 --> 35:09.000
Thank you.

35:14.166 --> 35:15.667
Can I buy you dinner?

35:15.709 --> 35:20.834
And tell you how right you were
over and over?

35:20.875 --> 35:22.291
I can't.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.458
But-- But thank you.

35:25.500 --> 35:26.542
Oh.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.041
You probably
don't need to know this,

35:28.083 --> 35:30.291
but I've had a string
of unsuccessful relationships

35:30.333 --> 35:32.291
and now I have this amazing guy
in my life

35:32.333 --> 35:34.709
who does amazing things
for me and...

35:36.333 --> 35:38.667
You...

35:38.709 --> 35:40.500
Well, let's just say
that I am focusing

35:40.542 --> 35:42.000
on the good, on the one.

35:59.542 --> 36:01.041
I'm not the mommy type.

36:01.083 --> 36:03.875
I don't like kids
and I don't want kids.

36:03.917 --> 36:05.166
And I'm a pediatrician.
I love kids.

36:05.208 --> 36:07.375
I've always wanted kids.
I need to have kids.

36:14.083 --> 36:16.000
They'll like you
more than they'll like me.

36:17.375 --> 36:18.625
I'm not...

36:20.834 --> 36:21.834
...warm.

36:22.834 --> 36:24.041
They will love you.

36:24.083 --> 36:27.208
What if I end up
like my mother?

36:27.250 --> 36:30.083
Drunk at noon,
hating the rug rats

36:30.125 --> 36:31.333
I'm supposed to love,

36:31.375 --> 36:34.250
screwing up our kids,
damaging them.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.041
See? Now you're gonna leave me.

36:38.083 --> 36:40.041
This is why I didn't
wanna talk about it.

36:40.083 --> 36:43.333
Charlotte, I'm not leaving you.
We're having the conversation.

36:43.375 --> 36:45.875
And you didn't walk out
and you didn't shut down

36:45.917 --> 36:47.417
and you didn't try
to confuse me with sex.

36:47.458 --> 36:50.542
We're having the conversation.

36:50.583 --> 36:53.000
And we can keep having it.

36:54.667 --> 36:56.041
We don't have to decide
right now?

36:56.083 --> 36:58.000
We don't have to decide
right now.

36:59.375 --> 37:00.709
What now?

37:02.875 --> 37:05.333
Now you can confuse me
with sex.

37:05.375 --> 37:07.375
Yeah?
Yes, please.

37:11.083 --> 37:13.000
Take your clothes off.

37:25.083 --> 37:26.041
I know your game.

37:26.083 --> 37:28.250
You perform like
a triathlete in the bedroom

37:28.291 --> 37:30.709
to get women in elevators
all gossiping about you.

37:30.750 --> 37:34.041
You play the "insecure, shy,
indecisive therapist" bit.

37:34.083 --> 37:36.583
And in the end, you're the guy
who ends up with all the girls

37:36.625 --> 37:38.041
and nobody
ever saw it coming.

37:38.083 --> 37:40.458
You're horrible
at taking rejection.

37:40.500 --> 37:42.458
Heh. I am not.

37:42.500 --> 37:45.041
Horrible. You're the baby
of the family, right?

37:45.083 --> 37:46.834
That's a little easy.
You know what?

37:46.875 --> 37:48.750
I take it back.
This whole offer, I--

37:48.792 --> 37:50.000
Let me tell you
how this would go.

38:01.834 --> 38:04.959
We'd sleep together and at first
it would be just for kicks,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.041
but eventually
I'd fall for you hard.

38:07.083 --> 38:09.875
And then you would do what women
like you, the bad girls,

38:09.917 --> 38:11.709
the ones who like it
dirty and nasty

38:11.750 --> 38:13.875
and a little bit kinky,

38:13.917 --> 38:16.333
you know, the ones
with serious daddy issues do.

38:16.375 --> 38:18.375
You'd run.

38:18.417 --> 38:21.500
You'd avoid me. You'd be
intentionally mean to me.

38:21.542 --> 38:24.125
My savior complex would kick in,
so I'd chase you,

38:24.166 --> 38:26.792
keep calling you,
let you use me for sex

38:26.834 --> 38:29.041
on the nights when
you were drunk or bored.

38:29.083 --> 38:31.291
But you're too damaged
to appreciate the fact

38:31.333 --> 38:34.041
that I'm a good guy
and I could actually care.

38:34.083 --> 38:36.542
And then one day,
I'd show up at your apartment

38:36.583 --> 38:40.458
with flowers or something,
trying to woo you,

38:40.500 --> 38:42.250
only to find you on your couch
screwing some guy

38:42.291 --> 38:43.667
ten years younger than me.

38:43.709 --> 38:46.041
( chuckles )

38:46.083 --> 38:47.208
Am I wrong?

38:49.083 --> 38:50.375
I don't need it, Amelia.

38:50.417 --> 38:53.583
I'm a grown man
looking for a grown woman.

38:53.625 --> 38:57.542
So when you grow up,
come find me.

38:57.583 --> 38:59.291
Because I am as good
as they say.

38:59.333 --> 39:01.000
( mellow pop music playing )

39:05.083 --> 39:08.917
( sighs )

39:08.959 --> 39:10.125
Addisam, huh?

39:15.250 --> 39:16.834
Yeah.

39:16.875 --> 39:18.208
( sighs )

39:23.750 --> 39:24.959
I will not hurt you.

39:29.417 --> 39:33.000
The reason you're always trying
to see five steps ahead

39:33.041 --> 39:34.792
is because you expect
to get hurt.

39:37.083 --> 39:40.583
Those other men,
they hurt you,

39:40.625 --> 39:43.208
so you're always
looking ahead,

39:43.250 --> 39:45.792
trying to protect yourself.

39:48.625 --> 39:49.875
There's no protection.

39:51.291 --> 39:53.625
There's no looking ahead.

39:53.667 --> 39:56.041
You're gonna
have to trust me.

39:59.208 --> 40:01.542
I will not hurt you. Okay?

40:05.083 --> 40:06.750
I will not hurt you.

40:08.500 --> 40:10.041
Say it.

40:10.083 --> 40:11.333
( sighs )

40:15.959 --> 40:19.000
You will not hurt me.

40:30.750 --> 40:32.333
I will not hurt you.

40:48.083 --> 40:49.041
Hey.

40:49.083 --> 40:50.250
Hi.

40:50.291 --> 40:53.667
So, Lewis called me.
He got a job.

40:53.709 --> 40:56.709
I mean, I went down there to see
and it's not washing cars.

40:56.750 --> 40:58.250
It's good. It's a good job.

40:58.291 --> 41:01.041
It's at a coffee shop.
He's making coffee.

41:01.083 --> 41:05.041
The owner said he trusted
Lewis's smile, which is...

41:05.083 --> 41:07.709
Yeah, he's gonna be
a barista.

41:07.750 --> 41:10.667
Last week, he'd never heard of
a latte and now he's a barista.

41:10.709 --> 41:14.125
I mean, isn't that just weird
and great

41:14.166 --> 41:18.083
and somehow hopeful
for the world?

41:18.125 --> 41:20.458
Like no babies in Africa
are gonna starve or--

41:20.500 --> 41:22.083
So instead of being home
with your son,

41:22.125 --> 41:23.583
you're out at 9:00 at night

41:23.625 --> 41:25.166
hanging with your buddy,
the murderer?

41:25.208 --> 41:27.083
No. You did-- Did you ju--?

41:28.375 --> 41:29.709
You did not just say that, Pete.

41:34.291 --> 41:35.959
Okay. Pete, I'm gonna ask you

41:36.000 --> 41:37.458
what's going on
and you're gonna tell me.

41:37.500 --> 41:39.041
Nothing. There's nothing.

41:39.083 --> 41:42.041
This is not about me
being out late. What's going on?

41:42.083 --> 41:43.291
I don't wanna talk about it.

41:43.333 --> 41:45.917
Well, you're married
to a therapist, Pete.

41:45.959 --> 41:49.792
I can wait here all night.

41:49.834 --> 41:51.000
I've done the prison thing,
okay?

41:52.667 --> 41:53.667
My family...

41:55.959 --> 41:57.000
My mother's in jail.

41:57.041 --> 41:59.041
And my brother's--

41:59.083 --> 42:01.041
Well, I don't really know
where he is,

42:01.083 --> 42:03.041
but he's probably in jail
by now too, so...

42:03.083 --> 42:04.083
Oh, Pete.

42:04.125 --> 42:05.542
I don't wanna go there,
Violet.

42:05.583 --> 42:07.500
I'm not sharing.
I don't wanna talk.

42:07.542 --> 42:09.041
They don't matter.
They're your family.

42:09.083 --> 42:10.041
No.

42:11.625 --> 42:14.041
No.

42:14.083 --> 42:16.500
You and Lucas are my family now.

42:29.291 --> 42:31.291
( upbeat theme playing )
