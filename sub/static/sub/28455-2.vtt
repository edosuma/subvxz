00:00.065 --> 00:04.587
Welcome to the Jimmy Stewart.
New recruit, Jamie McCain.

00:04.623 --> 00:07.689
Serving soldier, injured
in the line of duty.

00:09.860 --> 00:12.257
Sometimes people find it hard to
accept that their reality's changed.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.005
- I can relate.
- I'm Zoe, by the way.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.146
Don't take it too personally.

00:16.181 --> 00:18.395
When I was your age, I thought
I could save everyone too.

00:18.819 --> 00:22.744
Moving on, our resident
eccentric, Danny Adams.

00:22.780 --> 00:25.305
We all have to be careful in here.

00:25.341 --> 00:27.586
Mortality spikes way above average.

00:27.622 --> 00:28.647
Help.

00:29.556 --> 00:32.881
Young people are dying,
but the real question is why?

00:32.917 --> 00:34.365
I want you to leave me alone.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.069
Isolate yourself in a place like this

00:36.105 --> 00:38.030
and your mind can start to play tricks.

00:38.240 --> 00:40.125
Four soldiers lost their lives that day.

00:40.160 --> 00:43.044
The truth can't hurt you, unless you
really have something to hide.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.051
- So this was an accident?
- Sure, of course.

00:49.645 --> 00:51.890
I want you to have this.
You will need the data.

00:51.926 --> 00:54.011
Danny, what are you trying to say?

00:54.280 --> 00:56.160
There's only one thing
that fits the data.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.045
Angel of Death.

00:59.080 --> 01:00.525
A killer on the ward?

01:00.560 --> 01:04.327
You have to be careful. We all do.
Especially at night.

01:04.474 --> 01:05.498
Danny?

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:39.880 --> 01:40.980
Danny?

02:06.800 --> 02:08.720
Danny. It's me.

02:26.860 --> 02:27.913
Hey.

03:45.522 --> 03:48.522
<font color="#741b47">Sync & corrections by </font><font color="#ead1dc">emeline-whovian</font>
<font color="#741b47">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:50.394 --> 03:51.674
So...

03:53.560 --> 03:56.165
..Danny Adams' family
have been informed.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.645
I know many of staff were close to him,

03:58.680 --> 04:01.800
and his untimely death is a real
tragedy for this unit.

04:03.240 --> 04:06.525
But we still have a responsibility
to our other patients

04:06.560 --> 04:07.926
and their recovery.

04:08.320 --> 04:13.485
So, we'll do our best to keep calm
and carry on, yes?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.684
Any more on the cause of death?

04:15.920 --> 04:19.886
Not yet, but the pathology report
should clear up what happened.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.765
There will be an M&M meeting
to review current protocols

04:23.800 --> 04:25.368
when I have the relevant data.

04:25.760 --> 04:30.956
Rest assured, I will be the dog
with the proverbial bone.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.711
OK, thank you, everyone.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.729
Another day, another dollar.

04:41.320 --> 04:44.824
I told her what she could bloody
well do with her hand-me-down Dyson.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.160
..and the woman was like, "What?"

04:59.131 --> 05:01.755
Hey. You OK?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.205
Sorry, I'm tired.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.880
Didn't sleep much last night.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.520
Danny, you know.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.040
Sure.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.320
We're all pretty shocked.

05:22.491 --> 05:24.851
Archie tells me
you need some stitches in your leg.

05:27.134 --> 05:29.582
What on Earth were you doing
out of bed last night anyway?

05:31.840 --> 05:34.475
I think I tried to sleepwalk
and forgot my legs don't work.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.899
So, how did you do it?

05:37.760 --> 05:38.840
Bike accident.

05:40.360 --> 05:41.445
Got a new patient.

05:41.480 --> 05:44.662
One, two, three.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.030
Do you know what happened yet?

05:49.140 --> 05:50.180
To Danny?

05:51.600 --> 05:54.018
We won't know anything
until after the PM.

05:55.010 --> 05:56.587
Danny talked to me,

05:57.520 --> 05:58.920
told me he was scared.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.640
He had data...

06:02.932 --> 06:04.510
..about people who die here.

06:05.340 --> 06:07.060
He wanted to show it to me, thought...

06:08.400 --> 06:10.239
..thought I could do something with it.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.165
You're saying Danny Adams was collecting

06:15.200 --> 06:17.365
mortality data for this unit?

06:17.806 --> 06:19.000
That's right.

06:19.920 --> 06:20.960
Why?

06:22.320 --> 06:24.288
He thought there was
a killer on the ward.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.605
A killer on the ward?

06:26.640 --> 06:27.722
That's right.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.765
Those were his exact words.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.400
Now he's the one who's dead.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.016
I think he was right.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.765
This isn't normal, right?

06:37.100 --> 06:38.420
For a place like this?

06:39.960 --> 06:42.169
Spinal injuries increase mortality.

06:42.901 --> 06:45.525
People don't understand
the potential complications.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.318
So, it's just a huge coincidence?

06:47.680 --> 06:50.213
One minute he's telling me there's a
problem, the next minute he's dead.

06:51.602 --> 06:54.005
Everyone is doing their very best,

06:54.140 --> 06:56.880
and there's no evidence that
Danny's death was suspicious.

07:08.660 --> 07:10.540
Is there a problem, Archie?

07:12.300 --> 07:13.700
Well, you tell me.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.965
You looked like you'd seen
a ghost in there. I was concerned.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.445
Is everything OK?

07:19.580 --> 07:20.620
Um...

07:22.400 --> 07:25.725
This... this thing with Danny is
a real blow to all of us.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.120
He told me something...

07:28.240 --> 07:30.067
..on the home visit.

07:31.040 --> 07:35.605
We were just chatting about
going home and, you know,

07:35.640 --> 07:38.321
all the usual sort of things and, uh...

07:39.496 --> 07:40.856
..and then he told me that...

07:42.540 --> 07:47.038
..that he'd had thoughts
of harming himself...

07:47.640 --> 07:49.339
..and that he'd been on these

07:49.960 --> 07:54.033
damn websites where they actually
encourage it, for God's sake.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.205
I didn't really know what to do,
so I just told him to stop

07:57.240 --> 07:58.487
being so silly.

07:59.276 --> 08:01.881
Did he make any specific threats,

08:01.917 --> 08:04.002
have a formal plan or any
particular method in mind?

08:04.038 --> 08:05.358
No, nothing.

08:08.380 --> 08:09.940
What I'm about to show you...

08:11.100 --> 08:12.620
..is strictly confidential.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.965
One of the cleaning teams found this
amongst Danny's sheets this morning.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.925
Now, this could be a case of negligence,

08:21.960 --> 08:23.691
which will mean trouble for us all.

08:24.534 --> 08:25.574
Oh, shit.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.965
On the other hand,
given what you've just told me,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.245
Danny might have used it
to kill himself.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.565
Please keep it to yourself

08:32.600 --> 08:36.125
until Parveen's had a chance to
confirm the exact cause of death.

08:36.159 --> 08:38.445
I'm going to tighten
security around here to ensure

08:38.480 --> 08:40.650
that medication doesn't fall
into the wrong hands again.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.845
He was everybody's patient.

08:44.217 --> 08:46.931
If Danny did kill himself,
then we all failed him.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.274
You did everything you could, darling.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.231
Don't blame yourself for this.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.649
It could all be connected to his PTSD.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.869
He's currently experiencing a fight
or flight adrenaline rush 24/7.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.739
In effect, his body believes
he's still fighting.

09:06.280 --> 09:09.685
His military training makes him feel
guilty that he couldn't save Danny.

09:09.720 --> 09:12.001
So now he's choosing to believe
Danny's theory.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.726
Places like this can play tricks on you,

09:15.040 --> 09:17.805
lack of normal sensory input,
confusing environment,

09:17.840 --> 09:18.920
change in routine.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.160
So what do we do?

09:22.120 --> 09:23.353
Keep talking to him.

09:23.840 --> 09:26.805
Contact with visitors from outside,
friends and family,

09:26.840 --> 09:28.285
make him feel safe and secure.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.640
Well, you know,
as much as any of us can.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.047
I don't want 'em.

10:14.975 --> 10:17.080
Knock me out too much.
I can't think straight.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.740
- If they've been prescribed...
- I don't want 'em.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.085
You're refusing to take medication?

10:27.080 --> 10:28.682
Looks that way, doesn't it?

10:29.840 --> 10:31.225
I'll talk to the doctors.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.385
Baclofen's prescribed for muscle spasms.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.045
They should make you more comfortable.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.562
Then why does it knock me out?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.365
There are mild sedative side effects,

10:42.400 --> 10:44.565
- but the benefits and increased mobility...
- I'll risk it.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.605
I don't need to be comfortable.
I need to stay alert.

10:47.640 --> 10:49.451
I don't trust anyone around here.

10:50.308 --> 10:52.697
Uncontrolled muscle spasms
could delay your recovery.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.496
If we're going to get you walking
again, you need to cooperate.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.376
So get me something that doesn't
turn me into a zombie.

11:01.980 --> 11:03.796
What if we try a reduced dose?

11:04.866 --> 11:06.631
I don't want to delay
your physio programme.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.354
Debbie's dying to get her hands on you.

11:09.606 --> 11:11.246
I really think it's for the best.

11:30.862 --> 11:31.933
OK.

11:32.669 --> 11:33.731
Half.

11:34.460 --> 11:35.460
Deal.

12:49.360 --> 12:52.725
So, how long does the science bit
take these days?

12:52.760 --> 12:54.245
It depends on the backlog.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.055
You know Campbell has gone off sick.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.605
He was one of yours?

12:57.640 --> 12:58.676
Afraid so.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.125
Partial T6, very sad.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.285
Hm.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.424
None of the other doctors
ever come down here.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.120
More than happy to bury their mistakes.

13:07.280 --> 13:10.245
Well, that's because I'm
secretly in love with you, Parveen.

13:10.280 --> 13:13.005
I'm just working up
the courage to tell you.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.285
Now I know you're joking.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.965
No-one fantasises about pathologists.

13:17.239 --> 13:19.565
Would you be able to take
a look at this syringe for me?

13:19.600 --> 13:21.283
I suspect it contained insulin.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.565
And a cause of death?
I mean, not to rush you,

13:23.600 --> 13:26.165
but as soon as you have anything
could it hit my desk first,

13:26.200 --> 13:28.845
just so that I can get my facts
straight for the powers that be?

13:28.880 --> 13:31.625
I'll try and look at it today, if I can.

13:32.984 --> 13:35.495
What would we do without you?

13:58.840 --> 14:00.525
No-one would believe me.

14:00.560 --> 14:03.080
But they'll trust you.
You're in the Army.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.745
Guess what.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.420
Your boss is here.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.725
All right there, buddy.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.325
Given you top spot.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.800
I'll just go get her.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.000
Corporal McCain?

15:01.920 --> 15:04.791
We've reviewed
the evidence in its entirety so far.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.882
There are discrepancies
with your initial statement.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.400
You told us the attack was unprovoked.

15:12.560 --> 15:13.645
It was.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.180
So you maintain you all
simply returned fire?

15:17.680 --> 15:20.705
We were ambushed and we responded
by the book, Sergeant.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.876
Can I be honest with you, Corporal?

15:24.280 --> 15:26.054
I don't believe that's what happened,

15:26.440 --> 15:27.997
which means you're lying to me.

15:28.759 --> 15:30.965
There are questions
about your leadership that day,

15:31.000 --> 15:32.165
decisions that you made...

15:32.200 --> 15:34.485
14 men have died in that
region in the last four years.

15:34.520 --> 15:37.347
Shot, blown up, picked off by snipers.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.205
They killed a foot patrol
with a roadside bomb,

15:40.240 --> 15:41.727
hung their bodies up from the trees.

15:43.080 --> 15:44.399
Just left them there.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.639
My guys had to take them down.

15:47.778 --> 15:50.005
So you can understand
if my men were a little tense.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.445
No-one is denying the operational
strain you were under,

15:52.480 --> 15:55.563
but it is still important the Army
establish the truth.

15:56.382 --> 15:58.792
We believe you didn't follow
protocol that day.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.983
If enemy combatants were
killed, unlawfully,

16:02.320 --> 16:04.226
then a crime has been committed...

16:05.469 --> 16:08.263
..which is why I'm going to recommend
that this investigation continues,

16:08.299 --> 16:10.007
with a view to a possible court martial.

16:12.397 --> 16:13.764
Do you have any questions?

16:16.011 --> 16:18.248
I might be easier if you talk to me.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.960
I think Charlie Elland found it
very helpful, psychologically.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.139
What did he say?

16:26.520 --> 16:27.965
He gave my colleague a full

16:28.000 --> 16:29.761
and detailed report
of the entire incident.

16:31.520 --> 16:32.623
Bullshit.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.440
Charlie said nothing.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.211
I thought you were better than that.

16:40.713 --> 16:42.886
This is a serious charge.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.125
If you're found guilty,
it could mean military prison.

16:47.160 --> 16:48.373
It's getting cold.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.600
- I'll take you inside.
- It's fine.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.645
McGould, Matt and now Danny.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.781
I'm not surprised that
Jamie's freaking out.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.044
It's a hospital - people die.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.798
Just like when you shoot them.

17:10.720 --> 17:11.954
You'd think he'd be used to it.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.164
Danny was a partial T6.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.365
Put him at risk of sepsis.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.665
- ADVTE.
- Is this a tutorial?

17:19.960 --> 17:21.310
Because I could take notes.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.021
I liked him.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.960
He was a nice kid, not a case study.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.599
We dehumanise people
so that we don't have to

17:30.160 --> 17:32.165
care when something happens.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.360
Maybe YOU do.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.000
Look, it's not your fault, OK?

17:37.036 --> 17:38.566
It's not my fault. It's
not anyone's fault's.

17:38.602 --> 17:40.469
It's like Archie said,
we've just been unlucky.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.005
A bad run.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.212
These things happen.

17:45.255 --> 17:47.965
There doesn't always have to be
someone to blame, OK?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.589
I should definitely be taking notes.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.613
Sorry, that was shit.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.311
Hey, I'm sorry.

17:58.550 --> 18:00.908
You're right. You're always right.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.720
That's what's so irritating.

18:29.680 --> 18:32.160
Right, you going to be good tonight?

18:42.110 --> 18:43.580
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.005
You have to be careful.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.920
People die in here.

19:36.440 --> 19:37.720
Think.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.725
It's important that you listen to me.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.109
You're still weak
and I won't be around to help you.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.560
Look.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.280
Oh.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.240
TARDIS.

20:26.640 --> 20:32.320
T-A-R-D-I-S.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.000
Yes. Come on.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.920
Oh, no.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.485
Oh, shit!

21:34.320 --> 21:35.605
I'm sorry.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.320
Oh, I couldn't resist it.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.365
- Oh, God.
- If you want your report, it's not ready.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.805
I can bring it up tomorrow.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.045
I've got a thousand things to do,
thanks to Campbell's

21:45.080 --> 21:46.525
so-called spine.

21:46.560 --> 21:49.605
They say yoga is very
good... for spines.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.485
I was considering euthanasia.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.445
Mm, sadly not yet an option.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.965
Plus, imagine how swamped you'd be

21:55.000 --> 21:57.200
if we all started
bumping off our patients.

21:58.320 --> 21:59.479
So, tomorrow?

21:59.760 --> 22:01.642
Tomorrow. First thing.

22:02.160 --> 22:04.428
I appreciate this is above
and beyond, Parveen.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.560
I owe you a drink.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.182
Somewhere nice, I think,
if you fancy it.

24:36.440 --> 24:37.680
What are you doing?

24:40.860 --> 24:42.065
It's OK.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.240
God's sake.

24:44.320 --> 24:47.285
Jamie, you have to stay in your bed.
I can't have this.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.120
Sorry.

25:25.588 --> 25:28.153
Not quite sure the world is ready
for us to be arriving together.

25:28.189 --> 25:29.229
Mm.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.040
Thank you for last night.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.697
You know what it felt like?

25:44.690 --> 25:45.810
The future.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.479
Our future.

25:49.720 --> 25:50.760
I do.

25:51.920 --> 25:54.285
However, can I just point out
we are now a future couple

25:54.320 --> 25:55.885
who are running five minutes late?

25:55.920 --> 25:57.098
Yes, sir.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.020
Straight away, sir.

26:07.616 --> 26:09.965
Sure, a wee camera's simple enough.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.925
The thing is, we've had
a few things go walkabout

26:11.960 --> 26:13.845
and I want to get this done pronto.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.205
You're the boss.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.320
So they tell me.

26:25.560 --> 26:26.760
Hey.

26:28.864 --> 26:30.360
Hi.

26:32.137 --> 26:33.480
Next time just ask, yeah?

26:35.149 --> 26:36.734
Yeah, OK.

26:38.040 --> 26:40.078
Ready? Catch.

26:43.640 --> 26:44.845
Thanks.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.070
No worries.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.885
Nothing to do here
but binge on TV shows, eh?

26:48.920 --> 26:50.080
Right, yeah.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.529
Can't live without it.

27:24.640 --> 27:25.785
Me again.

27:28.587 --> 27:29.956
Brought you these.

27:30.542 --> 27:32.307
Come on, let's hit the beach.

27:40.194 --> 27:41.594
It's lovely once you're in.

27:44.360 --> 27:45.500
You ready?

27:59.320 --> 28:00.600
There.

28:01.640 --> 28:05.240
And I've just got one more,
just under your arm here.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.460
OK.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.385
Right.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.120
Are you ready?

28:24.400 --> 28:25.720
Are you OK?

28:30.240 --> 28:31.520
All right.

28:32.640 --> 28:33.880
Right.

28:40.520 --> 28:41.760
Right, here we go.

28:56.800 --> 29:00.029
Too cold? Thought you were meant
to be a tough guy.

29:17.440 --> 29:19.325
Now, then.

29:19.360 --> 29:22.220
Taking the weight off your
muscles a little bit, isn't it?

29:22.640 --> 29:27.057
And with time and a bit
of dedication, we will rebuild them.

29:32.620 --> 29:34.420
Just try and breathe for me.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.480
Can you do that?

29:40.758 --> 29:43.193
Imagine you're on a nice beach,

29:43.672 --> 29:45.842
lovely warm sun in your face.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.040
Jamie!

29:58.400 --> 30:00.765
OK, you're safe.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.117
Just breathe.

30:05.772 --> 30:08.332
Just relax. Hey.

30:13.080 --> 30:14.240
Ah.

30:15.920 --> 30:17.560
Stop, you're hurting me!

30:22.063 --> 30:24.165
I hear Jamie McCain was out of bed
again last night

30:24.278 --> 30:26.245
in another patient's bay.

30:26.280 --> 30:27.483
He's also been

30:27.945 --> 30:29.315
refusing medication.

30:29.640 --> 30:31.205
Baclofen makes him drowsy.

30:31.240 --> 30:32.685
We agreed to try cutting it down.

30:32.720 --> 30:34.926
So, now we're letting patients
dictate treatment.

30:36.640 --> 30:39.672
We sure he's not special forces?
He seems to favour night manoeuvres.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.720
Hydrotherapy. Shit.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.254
What happened?

30:52.600 --> 30:55.485
He was in the pool and he panicked
and just started thrashing around.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.165
I thought he might have been having
some kind of seizure.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.529
He's hyperventilating
and tachycardic, 160.

31:00.565 --> 31:01.605
Jamie?

31:02.920 --> 31:03.961
He's OK.

31:04.404 --> 31:06.772
Let's get him back to the ward
before hypothermia kicks in.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.158
The blood tests were normal.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.723
Looks like you had some
kind of panic attack.

31:23.560 --> 31:26.192
Don't worry,
it's happened before in the pool.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.960
Lack of control can upset people.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.320
What I'm saying is it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

31:35.440 --> 31:38.653
Anyway, I'm here if you ever...

31:40.500 --> 31:42.820
What I'm trying to say
is that you can trust me.

31:45.620 --> 31:46.660
Can I?

31:48.032 --> 31:49.341
It's the law.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.965
Patient's best interests.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.011
I think there's even
some kind of oath thing.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.634
I know you don't believe
there's a killer, but...

32:00.960 --> 32:02.401
Isn't that Danny's?

32:02.720 --> 32:03.862
I had to take it.

32:04.240 --> 32:05.863
If he's right, this is evidence.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.965
It's statistics, death rates.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.325
You stole it?

32:09.360 --> 32:12.245
I needed it and it was
left on his bed the night he died.

32:12.280 --> 32:13.403
I think it's all here.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.485
Names and dates,
comparisons with other units.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.565
I've looked at it,
but I don't understand it.

32:18.600 --> 32:19.640
You will.

32:21.680 --> 32:22.745
OK.

32:22.880 --> 32:24.065
Fine.

32:24.599 --> 32:26.644
I need to take this now
before anyone sees you with it.

32:26.680 --> 32:29.125
I really can't let you keep
another patient's property.

32:29.160 --> 32:30.387
But you'll look at it?

32:31.242 --> 32:33.125
Sure. I'll look at it.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.184
Promise.

32:35.960 --> 32:38.565
Anyway, it's dinner time.
You need to eat.

32:38.600 --> 32:39.998
Just leave this with me, OK?

32:40.240 --> 32:42.925
And don't talk to anyone else about it.

32:43.157 --> 32:44.633
It won't be helpful.

32:45.985 --> 32:47.590
Understood. Thanks.

32:47.626 --> 32:48.617
OK.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.678
Oh, you'll need the pass...

32:56.202 --> 32:57.254
..code.

32:58.280 --> 33:01.165
Perhaps he still sees
things in terms he can relate to,

33:01.200 --> 33:03.694
good and evil, threat and response.

33:04.081 --> 33:06.525
If he's given you Danny's tablet,
that's a good sign.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.965
He's learning to trust again.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.845
Now he needs to realise that there
was nothing he could do for Danny.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.003
I'll talk to him.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.845
Danny Adams' parents, to see Dr Watson.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.965
Thanks, Alastair, shouldn't be long.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
Could you just give him a call
and tell him they're here?

33:46.000 --> 33:47.600
Yes, Mr and Mrs Adams.

33:50.448 --> 33:52.038
This way, please.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.049
Excuse me? Hey.

33:58.440 --> 34:00.245
Sorry, dropped it.

34:00.348 --> 34:02.664
- Could you...?
- Yes, of course.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.095
Thanks.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.678
There you go.

34:07.200 --> 34:08.525
Lost my place.

34:08.772 --> 34:10.725
I'll have to start again
from the beginning.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.214
Perhaps we should all do the same.

34:13.679 --> 34:16.654
Would you mind drawing
the curtains for me?

34:17.525 --> 34:19.128
I keep asking the nurses.

34:19.480 --> 34:20.679
Of course.

34:28.797 --> 34:30.357
You're Danny's mother, right?

34:31.375 --> 34:32.415
I'm Jamie.

34:33.464 --> 34:34.730
Jamie McCain.

34:35.179 --> 34:36.260
Grace.

34:37.239 --> 34:38.949
I'm very sorry for your loss.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.645
Thank you.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.175
He was just across from me.

34:43.520 --> 34:44.800
We used to talk.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.230
Football, that kind of thing.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.565
Danny hated football.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.058
I know. That's what we talked about.

34:55.280 --> 34:56.523
How was he?

34:56.960 --> 34:58.184
When you visited him.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.184
What do you mean?

35:00.440 --> 35:01.880
Did he say anything to you?

35:02.343 --> 35:03.336
About...

35:04.514 --> 35:07.365
about being scared or worried...

35:07.657 --> 35:08.697
in here?

35:09.499 --> 35:10.544
No.

35:10.720 --> 35:11.950
I don't think so.

35:12.540 --> 35:13.580
Grace.

35:20.760 --> 35:22.120
God bless you.

35:33.936 --> 35:35.075
How's Jamie?

35:35.440 --> 35:37.513
Fine. Better.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.623
It was just a simple panic attack.

35:40.360 --> 35:41.765
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.845
You know, I just thought, well,

35:43.880 --> 35:46.793
I didn't want to after everything
with Danny, you know.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.566
God, you must think I'm a right fool.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.005
It's better to be safe than sorry.

35:52.720 --> 35:54.880
- You did the right thing.
- Oh, thank you.

35:56.240 --> 35:58.005
Do you know, he is so strong?

35:58.040 --> 36:00.845
When he was grabbing at me
in the pool, I think

36:00.880 --> 36:02.753
I just panicked myself a little bit.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.582
Oh.

36:05.000 --> 36:09.354
I think he's actually a very
unhappy boy, don't you?

36:09.565 --> 36:11.325
You know, I mean, not just the injury,

36:11.360 --> 36:14.000
but you know you can
just sense these things?

36:17.080 --> 36:18.120
Maybe.

36:19.220 --> 36:20.585
We'll get there.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.229
Always get there in the end.

36:24.620 --> 36:26.500
First of all, can I just say how...

36:27.400 --> 36:28.960
..sorry I am for your loss?

36:30.480 --> 36:31.685
Are those...?

36:31.720 --> 36:33.605
His effects, yes.

36:33.640 --> 36:38.400
We are still missing a tablet thingy
that he had. I'm sure it'll turn up.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.720
I imagine you both have questions.

36:43.440 --> 36:46.045
We just want to know
why he died, Doctor.

36:46.080 --> 36:51.005
Quite. Well, that is something
we are still trying to ascertain.

36:51.040 --> 36:53.365
Rest assured, when we have an answer,

36:53.400 --> 36:54.931
it will be communicated to you.

36:56.960 --> 36:59.709
What we don't understand
is that he wasn't sick.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.875
He'd been discharged.

37:15.640 --> 37:16.840
How did it go?

37:19.280 --> 37:21.045
As well as can be expected.

37:21.080 --> 37:22.487
They're shocked, of course.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.390
But you dealt with it?

37:25.120 --> 37:26.160
I hope so.

37:31.582 --> 37:32.664
Excuse me?

37:33.440 --> 37:36.005
- Hi.
- Dr Watson was anxious for this.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.685
He's not in his office, so...

37:37.720 --> 37:39.247
Sure, I'll make sure he gets it.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.114
Danny was my patient.

37:42.179 --> 37:44.205
Was there anything specific
you wanted me to tell him?

37:44.240 --> 37:45.485
I don't think so.

37:45.520 --> 37:48.765
Glucose levels were low, even for
postmortem vitreous sampling.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.367
Insulin high, C-peptide absent.

37:51.720 --> 37:53.970
OK, just be clear,

37:54.006 --> 37:56.685
you're confirming exogenous
insulin as cause of death?

37:56.720 --> 37:57.845
Huge overdose.

37:57.880 --> 38:00.685
Either he took it himself
or someone made a mistake,

38:00.720 --> 38:03.245
some agency nurse using
the wrong syringe?

38:03.280 --> 38:06.165
We get a few every year,
despite all the training.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.680
I'll make sure he gets it.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.645
It's very upsetting, for everyone.

38:16.758 --> 38:21.156
I just feel that if Danny's the
latest in a series of clinical errors,

38:21.343 --> 38:23.443
we need to do something, urgently.

38:24.121 --> 38:25.485
Mm, you're absolutely right.

38:25.716 --> 38:30.285
Or you would be if this was indeed

38:30.547 --> 38:32.524
the fault of a member of staff.

38:32.840 --> 38:35.765
Tragically, I don't think
this was a mistake.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.504
We found a syringe in Danny's bed.

38:39.072 --> 38:42.085
Parveen's confirmed it contains
traces of long-acting insulins.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.322
Together with the pathologist's report,

38:45.240 --> 38:48.267
I think the most likely
explanation is that Danny used

38:48.303 --> 38:51.458
a massive overdose of insulin
to take his own life.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.805
We knew that Danny was
suffering from depression,

38:54.840 --> 38:57.847
but now we've learned that he's
been researching suicide online.

38:58.320 --> 39:00.645
You think he took his own life

39:00.932 --> 39:02.861
the day before he was due to leave?

39:03.367 --> 39:06.045
Well, think about it.
Once he'd left the hospital,

39:06.080 --> 39:07.925
where else would he have found insulin?

39:08.720 --> 39:11.365
It's a shock, but you of all people
should know how overwhelming

39:11.400 --> 39:13.560
these feelings can be
once they take hold.

39:26.920 --> 39:28.205
I'm sure you're right.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.480
I'm always right.

39:47.214 --> 39:49.046
I can't find the oxybutynin.

39:49.082 --> 39:50.402
It should be here, right?

39:51.320 --> 39:52.720
Ah.

39:53.840 --> 39:54.988
There you go.

39:55.400 --> 39:56.438
Thanks.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.200
Way too easy, Danny.

40:48.798 --> 40:50.643
You have to be careful.

40:50.679 --> 40:52.764
We all do, especially at night.

40:53.057 --> 40:54.577
That's why I stay awake.

40:56.626 --> 40:58.521
People die in here.

40:58.557 --> 40:59.957
The numbers don't lie.

41:01.060 --> 41:02.380
I have the evidence.

41:12.520 --> 41:14.045
It's ready!

41:14.308 --> 41:15.320
OK.

41:32.400 --> 41:35.644
Stay awake, stay awake.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.080
Stay awake.

41:42.880 --> 41:45.065
Danny. It's me.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.520
Hey.

42:00.340 --> 42:01.700
Hello, Jamie.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.032
How are the nightmares?

42:09.273 --> 42:10.303
Better.

42:11.120 --> 42:12.520
The pills help.

42:23.400 --> 42:26.040
I worked on an acute unit for ten years.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.228
Oldest trick in the book.

42:30.680 --> 42:32.525
We can't force you to take them,

42:32.560 --> 42:34.280
but I'd rather you trusted me.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.446
Zoe told me you think Danny was killed.

42:43.160 --> 42:46.360
Don't blame her, she's a good
doctor and she wants to help you.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.944
I'm going to break medical
confidentiality for you.

42:54.545 --> 42:56.160
Believe me, I don't do it lightly.

42:58.080 --> 43:01.698
Danny Adams was being treated
for multiple mental health problems.

43:02.483 --> 43:04.781
Obviously he was on
the autistic spectrum,

43:05.400 --> 43:08.740
but he also suffered
severe anxiety and depression.

43:10.164 --> 43:14.157
That diagnosis causes increased
risk of suicidal acts

43:14.193 --> 43:16.875
to nearly seven times
the population average.

43:20.480 --> 43:22.720
You're telling me he wanted to die?

43:26.480 --> 43:27.880
Suicide sites.

43:29.400 --> 43:32.075
Online communities devoted
to ending your life.

43:32.733 --> 43:37.449
Danny joined them, communicated with
others on message boards and forums.

43:38.400 --> 43:40.215
And you didn't try and stop him?

43:40.600 --> 43:42.536
This is not unusual behaviour.

43:43.200 --> 43:45.763
Lots of our patients talk about suicide.

43:46.280 --> 43:47.686
It's very difficult.

43:48.280 --> 43:50.493
There's nothing you could
have done to stop him.

43:51.505 --> 43:52.872
Danny killed himself.

44:02.480 --> 44:04.006
I'd like to view the pathology files

44:04.042 --> 44:05.885
of some of our patients
from the last six months.

44:05.920 --> 44:07.645
Sorry, I can't release archived

44:07.680 --> 44:10.205
pathology data without
a consultant sign off.

44:10.240 --> 44:11.525
OK, well...

44:11.560 --> 44:14.005
As you know, we are very
short-staffed at the moment.

44:14.040 --> 44:16.320
If you leave your details,
I can get back to you.

44:16.880 --> 44:18.960
I can wait. It's important.

44:32.494 --> 44:36.552
_

45:23.080 --> 45:24.960
Lunch is served.

46:05.960 --> 46:07.445
Can I help you?

46:07.480 --> 46:11.125
Hi, I was just getting
some reports for the boss.

46:11.160 --> 46:12.725
Most people just call us.

46:12.760 --> 46:16.285
Yeah, I know how busy you are,
what with Dr Campbell being off.

46:16.655 --> 46:17.930
Sorry.

46:18.340 --> 46:19.460
Thanks.

46:33.920 --> 46:36.981
It's gym time and I'm not...

46:37.800 --> 46:39.716
..taking no for an answer, right?

46:40.080 --> 46:43.165
We need to get you up and moving about.

46:43.200 --> 46:46.970
We need to build those muscles
back up, give them half a chance.

46:47.800 --> 46:50.600
Don't worry, you'll be
on dry land this time.

46:52.040 --> 46:54.320
Should be nothing for a man like you.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.085
Here we are.

47:19.120 --> 47:21.160
My little world.

47:25.840 --> 47:27.400
Right, scooch a bit forward.

47:29.640 --> 47:30.926
Whoa.

47:31.320 --> 47:32.360
You got it.

47:34.058 --> 47:35.459
And...

47:36.819 --> 47:39.105
That's it. There we go.

47:39.320 --> 47:43.560
Right, just, just put your arms
around me, just for a wee sec.

47:44.240 --> 47:45.483
Can you do that?

47:46.498 --> 47:48.716
OK. Arms back on the bed.

47:50.040 --> 47:51.240
There you go.

47:59.840 --> 48:00.920
That's it.

48:03.600 --> 48:04.880
Right.

48:08.320 --> 48:10.925
Now all you have to do is push.

48:10.960 --> 48:13.031
I'm going to show you the movement,
all right?

48:16.860 --> 48:17.900
Just like that.

48:19.920 --> 48:21.026
OK?

48:22.078 --> 48:23.440
You going to have a try?

48:51.400 --> 48:52.605
It's OK.

48:52.640 --> 48:54.165
It's really tough the first time.

48:54.200 --> 48:55.680
I can do it.

48:56.680 --> 48:57.920
OK.

49:28.720 --> 49:30.125
Fuck.

49:30.160 --> 49:32.045
Listen, it's OK.

49:32.080 --> 49:35.965
We will do this again tomorrow
and the next day and the next day

49:36.000 --> 49:37.640
and the next day.

49:44.700 --> 49:45.900
OK?

50:00.900 --> 50:02.140
Hello, son.

50:05.700 --> 50:08.020
What happens now, with all this?

50:09.960 --> 50:12.113
I lie here until my legs start working.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.921
So that's it,
they just start working again?

50:18.540 --> 50:21.242
Maybe. Maybe not.
That's the exciting bit.

50:23.280 --> 50:25.386
I'm surprised you agreed
to come back home.

50:28.480 --> 50:29.965
I had no choice.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.765
Military place was full. This was
my last registered addressed.

50:32.800 --> 50:33.880
Not my idea.

50:35.280 --> 50:36.760
Why didn't you call me?

50:38.600 --> 50:39.720
You know why.

50:42.060 --> 50:43.820
Is there something I can do?

50:45.720 --> 50:47.387
You can leave me alone.

50:48.360 --> 50:49.476
Right.

50:54.440 --> 50:55.965
I want to know who told her.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.474
Who told her I was here?

50:57.800 --> 51:00.645
I have a right to confidentiality.

51:00.680 --> 51:01.884
We don't speak.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.125
Not for a long time.

51:04.160 --> 51:05.751
It's a difficult situation.

51:06.800 --> 51:08.237
I'll talk to the doctors.

51:42.560 --> 51:44.000
Let's have a look.

51:45.440 --> 51:46.680
Smashing.

51:59.879 --> 52:02.756
_

52:15.360 --> 52:17.918
Jamie. Jamie.

52:23.240 --> 52:26.691
I don't want Juniors accessing
pathology data without permission.

52:27.445 --> 52:29.057
Can you have a word with her?

52:34.480 --> 52:36.205
Each one's the same.

52:36.240 --> 52:40.205
All the patients Danny identified,
each one had low blood sugar.

52:40.240 --> 52:41.920
Just the way Danny died.

52:43.840 --> 52:45.480
But I thought he killed himself?

52:46.600 --> 52:47.925
I don't think so.

52:47.960 --> 52:49.399
I think you were right.

52:50.440 --> 52:53.485
Danny was murdered, and not just Danny.

52:53.520 --> 52:54.800
All those people.

53:04.280 --> 53:05.762
So, what do we do?

53:07.560 --> 53:09.845
Look, if this is true,
I need some time to think,

53:09.880 --> 53:11.605
decide how to handle it.

53:11.640 --> 53:13.075
But you think I'm right?

53:13.600 --> 53:15.365
Either that or we're both nuts.

53:15.400 --> 53:17.725
I was just starting to believe that.

53:17.760 --> 53:19.045
If only.

53:19.080 --> 53:20.262
I'll find you tomorrow.

54:04.720 --> 54:06.960
So, are we ready to step this up a gear?

54:09.560 --> 54:11.205
Where did you get all this?

54:11.240 --> 54:13.365
Danny Adams gave it to Jamie McCain.

54:13.400 --> 54:14.805
Jamie McCain?

54:14.840 --> 54:17.405
The same guy who creeps around
the ward in the dead of night?

54:17.440 --> 54:19.725
Sorry, these terminals
are strictly staff only.

54:19.760 --> 54:21.125
Insulin is the weapon of choice.

54:21.160 --> 54:22.565
This isn't real proof of anything.

54:22.600 --> 54:24.165
He's getting more delusional.

54:24.200 --> 54:25.805
I want to go home.

54:25.840 --> 54:27.434
Everyone's out to get him.

54:28.387 --> 54:30.165
Come on in, I've put the kettle on.

54:30.200 --> 54:33.525
If he acts a bit strange,
try not to worry too much.

54:33.560 --> 54:35.845
If you examine the reports,
there's a clear pattern.

54:35.880 --> 54:37.965
Can we just stop this now, please?

54:38.214 --> 54:40.565
I don't want you to have
any more contact with Jamie.

54:40.600 --> 54:42.445
It's time this unit was rid of him.

54:42.480 --> 54:45.125
Welcome to the GBH Arms.

54:45.160 --> 54:47.765
You know, what happened,
what you did out there,

54:47.800 --> 54:49.560
I'll back you every step of the way.

54:51.440 --> 54:55.685
Zoe, she really doesn't
need any complications.

54:55.720 --> 54:58.845
I think we're looking at detention
and treatment too.

54:58.880 --> 55:01.685
You can't just imprison him,
Archie. It's outrageous.

55:01.720 --> 55:04.800
I need to talk to someone,
they're killing people!
