WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.499
Morning, guys.

00:04.534 --> 00:06.666
Is Alex awake yet?

00:10.468 --> 00:11.701
Yeah...

00:11.735 --> 00:13.402
Oh, good one, right?

00:14.669 --> 00:15.968
Hey, so what are you guys doing?

00:16.000 --> 00:18.634
Check it out. Conscience
and I are studying.

00:18.668 --> 00:21.234
But your mom and dad have been
trying to get you to study for years

00:21.269 --> 00:22.768
and you've been ignoring them.

00:22.803 --> 00:24.501
Ah, very true.

00:24.536 --> 00:27.702
However, they don't sit on my
lap and hold a book to my face.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.734
My conscience does do that.

00:32.502 --> 00:34.367
OK, Max, back to work.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.702
Let's try the "Picture This" spell.

00:36.736 --> 00:38.168
All right, what does that do?

00:38.202 --> 00:40.235
Well, you cast it
on any picture frame

00:40.269 --> 00:42.636
and you can see what's
going on someplace else.

00:42.671 --> 00:45.038
- Ah, cool.
- Guys...

00:45.072 --> 00:48.538
What is with all the yammering?
It's the middle of the night.

00:50.006 --> 00:51.673
Shh!

00:51.707 --> 00:53.275
We're studying!

00:53.309 --> 00:55.777
Oh. I thought you were working
on a ventriloquist act

00:55.812 --> 00:57.144
with two dummies.

01:00.114 --> 01:01.781
Conscience has been waking Max up

01:01.815 --> 01:04.581
and forcing him to study spells
before he knows he's awake.

01:04.617 --> 01:06.683
He just learned the
"Picture This" spell.

01:06.718 --> 01:10.052
He did? I haven't even
learned that one yet.

01:10.086 --> 01:11.987
It's in the next chapter.

01:12.021 --> 01:14.822
And I only know it's in the next
chapter because I put my gum there.

01:17.024 --> 01:20.190
That conscience can ruin my
chance of being the family wizard.

01:20.225 --> 01:22.692
You know what else
can ruin your chance?

01:22.726 --> 01:25.427
A little disease you
have called laziness.

01:25.461 --> 01:29.162
I'm not lazy, I'm just
resting up for my 30s.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.865
Yep. Got a lot planned.

01:36.635 --> 01:38.736
<i>* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *</i>

01:38.771 --> 01:40.604
<i>* That the end will no doubt
justify the means *</i>

01:40.639 --> 01:42.906
<i>* You can fix any problem with
the slightest of ease *</i>

01:42.940 --> 01:44.406
<i>* Yes, please *</i>

01:44.441 --> 01:46.343
<i>* But you might find out it'll
go to your head *</i>

01:46.377 --> 01:48.044
<i>* When you write a report on a
book you never read *</i>

01:48.078 --> 01:50.679
<i>* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *</i>

01:50.713 --> 01:52.146
<i>* That's what I said *</i>

01:52.181 --> 01:55.449
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

01:55.483 --> 01:59.284
<i>* When you can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *</i>

01:59.319 --> 02:02.987
<i>* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *</i>

02:03.021 --> 02:07.590
<i>* Because everything is
not what it seems *</i>

02:07.624 --> 02:10.792
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

02:10.827 --> 02:15.162
<i>* When you can have what you want
by the simplest of means *</i>

02:15.197 --> 02:18.532
<i>* Be careful not to mess with
the balance of things *</i>

02:18.566 --> 02:21.500
<i>* Because everything is not *</i>

02:22.702 --> 02:23.869
<i>* What it seems *</i>

02:23.870 --> 02:26.870

02:26.971 --> 02:28.305
Again.

02:29.773 --> 02:31.840
- Once more.
- Hey!

02:31.875 --> 02:33.741
You two weirdoes, get a cave.

02:36.110 --> 02:38.177
Don't be afraid of love, Alex.

02:38.212 --> 02:40.546
It's what makes the
world go 'round.

02:40.580 --> 02:43.182
Oh, well, so does money. So what's it
gonna cost to get you two out of here

02:43.216 --> 02:44.282
'cause I gotta study.

02:47.653 --> 02:50.220
Hi, everyone.
If you don't remember,

02:50.255 --> 02:53.322
I'm Chancellor Rudy Tootietootie
of the Monster Hunter Counci

02:53.357 --> 02:55.290
It's good to see you.

02:56.892 --> 02:59.894
I feel like a member
of the family already.

02:59.928 --> 03:02.762
When do we start the fight
over Grandma's will?

03:04.797 --> 03:07.498
Grandma's broke.
She doesn't have a will.

03:10.935 --> 03:13.636
Anyway, I...

03:15.138 --> 03:18.573
Do you guys smell
vanilla and death?

03:20.808 --> 03:24.477
Either there's a monster in here or you
guys need to clean out the refrigerator.

03:25.846 --> 03:28.013
It's my perfume.

03:28.047 --> 03:30.014
Uh, yeah!

03:30.049 --> 03:33.851
It's called Death by... Vanilla.

03:33.885 --> 03:35.619
We'll go get you some. Come on.

03:37.088 --> 03:38.355
Anyway...

03:39.824 --> 03:41.690
I'm here to tell you
you've completed

03:41.725 --> 03:44.726
your independent study
course in monster hunting.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.195
Uh, but I'm not even
done with the class, sir.

03:48.229 --> 03:52.264
Yep, that's how it works in the
go-go world of monster hunting.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.301
Anyway, this is your
first official case.

03:56.336 --> 03:58.970
There's a mummy loose in the area.

03:59.005 --> 04:00.772
Mummy?

04:00.807 --> 04:03.308
Um, sir, shouldn't you bring
in some monster hunters

04:03.342 --> 04:04.776
with more experience for that?

04:04.810 --> 04:07.178
Can't. They've all been destroyed.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.914
By the mummy?

04:11.849 --> 04:14.283
I'm required to say "no."

04:17.120 --> 04:18.786
Don't look into the mummy's eyes

04:18.822 --> 04:21.990
or you'll fall under his control
and you'll be his servant forever,

04:22.024 --> 04:23.992
which is way worse than it seems.

04:24.026 --> 04:27.428
- It seems pretty bad.
- Then you get it.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:46.011 --> 04:49.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down there.
We don't want to be too obvious.

04:54.084 --> 04:56.485
OK. So we'll just pop in here,

04:56.519 --> 04:59.621
do a little mummy research
before the museum closes.

05:03.759 --> 05:05.559
Huh. I knew her.

05:05.594 --> 05:08.194
- What's up?
- OK, come on.

05:09.430 --> 05:11.130
OK, so all I could
find on the Wiznet

05:11.164 --> 05:13.865
was that mummies enjoy cookie dough
ice cream, being buried alive,

05:13.900 --> 05:16.167
and extremely slow
walks in the park.

05:16.202 --> 05:20.971
Yeah, 'cause they're,
like, "Raaah!"

05:21.006 --> 05:23.040
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry!

05:23.074 --> 05:26.843
Did I just make you scared? - No.
I've been scared the whole time.

05:26.877 --> 05:28.644
You just reminded me oft.

05:28.679 --> 05:30.346
Oh, what did you just spill?

05:30.380 --> 05:31.647
Hmm.

05:33.049 --> 05:35.350
Monster hunter dust.

05:35.384 --> 05:38.119
It only glows and activates when
a monster has passed over it.

05:38.153 --> 05:40.054
ke... Like that?

05:41.656 --> 05:44.023
Yeah, well, you're a monster,
you passedver it.

05:44.058 --> 05:45.891
That's why it's been activated.

05:47.093 --> 05:49.327
What about these drips of
cookie dough ice cream?

05:50.996 --> 05:52.863
You hate cookie dough ice cream.

05:52.898 --> 05:54.998
But you know who loves it?

05:55.800 --> 05:56.867
The mummy.

05:58.369 --> 06:00.070
He's here.

06:07.979 --> 06:09.646
I've been thinking...

06:09.681 --> 06:12.515
Oh, thanks for the heads-up.
See ya! - No, no!

06:14.251 --> 06:16.685
Without Conscience around,

06:16.720 --> 06:18.954
Max won't do the right thing.

06:18.988 --> 06:21.891
We just need to get
him away from Max

06:21.925 --> 06:23.992
to buy me more time
to study and catch up.

06:24.027 --> 06:26.628
All right, just...
as long as I'm not involved.

06:26.662 --> 06:28.497
No problem. I'll distract Max

06:28.531 --> 06:30.866
while you invite Conscience to
do something out of the house.

06:30.900 --> 06:33.201
Do you ever hear me?

06:33.235 --> 06:34.769
Come on, go!

06:36.138 --> 06:38.105
Hey, Conscience,
there's a laser light show

06:38.139 --> 06:39.739
at the planetarium tonight.
Wanna go?

06:39.774 --> 06:42.074
Well, that sounds like fun,

06:42.109 --> 06:44.643
but I can't leave Max's side.

06:44.677 --> 06:47.111
It's not what a good
conscience does. - Mm-mmm.

06:47.146 --> 06:49.980
Yes, yes! And you have
done such a good job.

06:50.014 --> 06:52.983
I think you deserve a break.
Don't you, Max?

06:53.017 --> 06:54.785
Don't you think he
deserves a break?

06:54.819 --> 06:56.920
Um, well, I think so

06:56.955 --> 06:59.523
because at least once a day he says,
"Gimme a break, Max!"

07:01.258 --> 07:04.727
I guess I could use a little break.

07:09.132 --> 07:10.799
Unless we see Jeremy from science,

07:10.833 --> 07:13.267
and then you better act
like you're totally into me.

07:28.347 --> 07:30.048
- Excuse me.
- Hmm?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.717
Has anyone fnd a cell phone?

07:31.751 --> 07:33.085
Let's ok here.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.954
Yes, I did. Thank you.

07:36.989 --> 07:38.289
That's my phone.

07:38.323 --> 07:40.291
Yeah, one second. Hello.

07:40.325 --> 07:43.694
Yes, operator, can you please
connect me to anyone in Australia?

07:43.729 --> 07:46.229
I'm trying to find out what,
like, a koala bear sounds like.

07:46.264 --> 07:49.365
I think it's like a...

07:49.400 --> 07:50.800
Give me that!

07:52.669 --> 07:56.004
I'm so sorry. I think
it's just a little joke.

07:56.038 --> 07:58.506
Uh, sandwich is on us.

08:00.975 --> 08:04.077
Did I st hear you
give away a sandwich?

08:04.111 --> 08:05.845
There's something wrong with Max.

08:08.781 --> 08:10.849
Honey, where's Conscience?

08:10.850 --> 08:13.385
Uh, he went tohe Lazerama
light show with Harper.

08:13.419 --> 08:15.353
Alex thought he needed a break.

08:17.656 --> 08:19.156
Alex.

08:20.491 --> 08:21.858
Hello!

08:21.893 --> 08:24.494
Just studying.

08:24.528 --> 08:26.529
Oh, I found my gum!

08:27.597 --> 08:29.097
What did you do?

08:29.131 --> 08:31.132
Nothing! I just encourag Conscience

08:31.167 --> 08:34.068
to take a well-deserved
break fromax.

08:34.102 --> 08:37.005
Now, if you'll excuse me,

08:37.039 --> 08:40.408
I'm on a long trip to education.

08:41.477 --> 08:43.044
Invisible shade.

08:44.548 --> 08:46.015
Excuse me?

08:51.054 --> 08:53.689
Did you know that if Max and
Conscience are separated too long

08:53.723 --> 08:56.291
that Conscience will
become a person of his own

08:56.326 --> 08:58.293
and never go back to Max?

08:58.328 --> 09:01.296
And one of the reasons
why I don't ow that

09:01.331 --> 09:04.366
is because people keep interrupting
me when I'm trying to study.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.503
I bet you that kind of
stuff's on thnextage of this.

09:09.839 --> 09:12.040
Yep, there it is. OK, I'll fix it.

09:15.311 --> 09:18.579
<i>the Egyptian exhibit
is now closed.</i>

09:22.283 --> 09:24.017
The coast is clear.

09:24.051 --> 09:26.686
This is weird.

09:27.655 --> 09:29.789
These are usually shut

09:29.823 --> 09:31.524
I'll bet the mummy opened it.

09:32.526 --> 09:33.959
Come on.

09:41.834 --> 09:44.602
Oh, n! Uh...

09:44.636 --> 09:46.470
You must have hit a switch
or something. Look around.

09:46.505 --> 09:48.506
There's gotta be awitch
around hersomeere.

09:54.746 --> 09:58.015
No. I know who did it
and I have good news.

09:58.049 --> 09:59.316
Oh.

10:00.152 --> 10:01.852
We found the mummy.

10:04.923 --> 10:06.223
Shield your eyes!

10:15.966 --> 10:17.465
Huh?

10:29.599 --> 10:32.132
OK, he's gone. Let's not panic.

10:32.166 --> 10:33.266
Right.

10:34.737 --> 10:36.038
Mommy!

10:36.072 --> 10:37.539
Mommy, please!

10:37.574 --> 10:39.208
Please let me out of here!

10:39.242 --> 10:41.476
Mommy, please!

10:44.613 --> 10:46.046
Yep, it's soundproof.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.381
Yeah. Uh...

10:50.084 --> 10:51.084
Magic.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.289
the natural enemy of magic.

10:57.957 --> 10:59.290
OK, cover your eyes.

10:59.324 --> 11:00.924
I'm gonna try and
break us out of here.

11:06.963 --> 11:08.296
Ow!

11:09.498 --> 11:12.166
No, no! I wouldn't step
over here if I were you.

11:12.201 --> 11:14.735
That second hit knocked
the guano out of me.

11:20.175 --> 11:21.475
The mummy's here. OK, remember,

11:21.509 --> 11:23.610
whatever you do,
do not look into his eyes.

11:39.226 --> 11:42.762
Welcome to my minion army!

11:42.796 --> 11:48.031
Now, you, go get me a pint
of cookie dough ice cream.

11:48.065 --> 11:53.371
And you, take my sarcophagus
to the back door.

11:57.011 --> 11:59.479
Hold on!

12:02.282 --> 12:04.282
I don't think he's after us.

12:04.317 --> 12:07.884
I think he's just trying
to get his stuff back.

12:07.918 --> 12:11.287
OK, so we wait here until the
museum opens in the morning,

12:11.321 --> 12:13.989
and then someone will come
and get us. Problem solved!

12:14.023 --> 12:16.124
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

12:16.158 --> 12:19.461
- Why not?
- See that?

12:19.495 --> 12:22.296
Oh, yeah. A skylight.

12:22.331 --> 12:24.365
Skylights are nice.

12:25.833 --> 12:29.669
Nice? No. Skylight, vampire...

12:29.703 --> 12:31.436
Morning, sunshine.

12:31.471 --> 12:35.273
Ow!

12:35.307 --> 12:36.907
Ash.

12:38.243 --> 12:41.211
We are in deep guano.

12:56.925 --> 12:58.325
What are you doing?

12:58.359 --> 13:01.328
Sometimes when it's awkward and
there's nothing to talk about

13:01.362 --> 13:04.563
I just... laugh to fill the space!

13:07.400 --> 13:09.468
There's something in your backpack.

13:09.502 --> 13:11.002
Am I too late? Catch me up.

13:11.037 --> 13:13.838
I'm your new conscience.

13:22.613 --> 13:23.946
This is great!

13:23.981 --> 13:25.748
I'm growing my own conscience.

13:25.782 --> 13:28.017
That means I'm
becoming my own person.

13:28.051 --> 13:31.786
Conscience,
you've gotta get home now.

13:31.820 --> 13:33.521
I'm not called Conscience anymore.

13:39.961 --> 13:41.828
This is all awkward for you,
isn't it?

13:48.368 --> 13:52.203
Hello, girls. I'm
Conscience's new conscience.

13:52.237 --> 13:54.538
Oh, no, it's gone
further than I thought.

13:56.108 --> 13:57.776
We've gotta get him out of there.

14:07.151 --> 14:10.287
Look, Conscience, you've got
to see what's going on at home.

14:11.322 --> 14:13.122
Excuse me.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.490
<i>Please, please, tell me now</i>

14:14.524 --> 14:15.991
<i>Is there something I should know</i>

14:16.025 --> 14:17.592
<i>Duranium Duranius</i>

14:17.626 --> 14:19.260
He's eating my special mustard!

14:19.294 --> 14:21.395
He's not even supposed
to touch that!

14:21.429 --> 14:22.462
Mmm!

14:23.831 --> 14:26.131
He's wiping his face
on my couch pillows!

14:26.166 --> 14:27.898
Would you forget about
the couch pillows?!

14:27.933 --> 14:30.234
He's eating my special mustard!

14:30.269 --> 14:32.437
It's good!

14:34.673 --> 14:37.108
Going back would be
the right thing to do.

14:37.142 --> 14:39.009
Yeah, it looks pretty
bad back there,

14:39.043 --> 14:41.410
but... that's your problem now.

14:41.445 --> 14:43.345
I'm my own person.

14:45.648 --> 14:46.981
How much do you weigh?

14:47.016 --> 14:49.450
I don't know. A buck, a buck five.

14:51.052 --> 14:52.019
We can take him.

14:56.091 --> 14:57.758
I'll get us out of here.

14:57.792 --> 14:59.926
All I need is something
big and heavy,

14:59.960 --> 15:01.894
like, uh... No.

15:01.929 --> 15:03.429
Like a boulder!

15:04.431 --> 15:05.898
Juliet, we're saved!

15:05.933 --> 15:08.501
Let me just... OK,
lift with the back.

15:18.645 --> 15:19.879
Styrofoam?

15:28.255 --> 15:30.523
Great. Now what are we gonna do?

15:30.557 --> 15:32.058
Whoa! The mummy's back.

15:35.662 --> 15:37.062
Let us out of here,

15:37.097 --> 15:40.464
you wrapped in
strips of fabric guy!

15:40.499 --> 15:42.333
- Justin, Justin, um...
- Yeah?

15:42.367 --> 15:45.002
Let's not squander
whatever time we have left

15:45.037 --> 15:48.172
yelling kind of lame
insults at the mummy.

15:49.874 --> 15:52.808
Look, it's pretty obvious
I'm not gonna make it.

15:52.843 --> 15:56.411
Let's just be together
while we can, OK?

16:08.092 --> 16:11.261
Wait. I know what needs to happen.

16:12.964 --> 16:14.864
You have to look into his eyes.

16:14.899 --> 16:16.900
What?

16:16.934 --> 16:18.968
It's the only way you'll survive.

16:19.003 --> 16:21.905
If you look into his eyes
you'll become his servant.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.339
He'll take you with him.

16:23.374 --> 16:25.208
No. What about you?

16:25.242 --> 16:26.843
Someone will come get
me in the morning.

16:26.877 --> 16:29.712
No, I want to spend this
last night here with you.

16:29.747 --> 16:31.981
I want to be with you, too,

16:32.015 --> 16:34.250
but this is the only
chance you have.

16:44.794 --> 16:46.995
You can't catch me, Dad.
You can't catch me!

16:47.030 --> 16:48.330
Whoo!

16:50.500 --> 16:53.802
Put me down! I said put me down!

16:59.008 --> 17:01.943
Uh-oh. - Wait, as long as
you're going, can you take...

17:04.180 --> 17:06.214
Dad, I was thinking,
on my way back here

17:06.249 --> 17:09.584
I just learned a spell that could
turn Conscience into a pair of socks.

17:09.618 --> 17:11.586
Hey, that's perfect.

17:11.621 --> 17:14.589
Max can just wear Conscience.

17:14.624 --> 17:18.425
He only wears the same pair of socks anyway,
it might as well be Conscience.

17:18.461 --> 17:20.295
Theresa, that's not
how magic works,

17:20.329 --> 17:22.830
but I do know a spell
that will help.

17:22.865 --> 17:25.800
Conscience, get ready
to get back into Max.

17:25.835 --> 17:28.336
Goodbye, loser.
I'm never seeing you again.

17:28.371 --> 17:31.606
No, Max, I'm gonna be inside...

17:32.374 --> 17:33.541
Just do it.

17:34.843 --> 17:35.976
All right, here's the spell.

17:36.011 --> 17:39.512
Alex, say, "Scrubby dubby,
into the tubby."

17:42.383 --> 17:44.351
<i>Scrubby dubby, into the tubby</i>

17:46.588 --> 17:48.789
Oh, I see, I get it now.

17:50.925 --> 17:52.626
<i>Argyle, bobby, tube, knee-high</i>

17:52.661 --> 17:54.361
<i>Into socks turn this guy</i>

18:07.910 --> 18:11.778
What's wrong, honey? - I never
thought I'd see Max do laundry.

18:17.451 --> 18:19.051
Thank you, Alex.

18:20.453 --> 18:23.020
Mom, I'm sorry I broke the lamp.

18:23.055 --> 18:24.888
I promise I'll clean it up.

18:24.923 --> 18:28.091
And to do that, I'm going
to need a broom, a dustpan,

18:28.125 --> 18:31.060
double-stick tape, and a small dog.

18:31.961 --> 18:33.261
He's back.

18:33.296 --> 18:35.630
I'll grab the broom, the dustpan,
the double-stick tape.

18:35.665 --> 18:38.033
You grab some bacon and
hang out at the dog park.

18:38.067 --> 18:39.434
OK.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.638
Man, I'm getting better at this.

18:43.672 --> 18:45.439
Justin really should
watch his back.

18:45.474 --> 18:46.974
I can't wait to tell him.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.113
<i>Please, please tell me now Is there
something I should know</i>

18:52.148 --> 18:53.247
<i>Duranium Duranius</i>

18:57.385 --> 18:58.719
Oh, no.

19:01.789 --> 19:04.990
Justin, I know it's right.
I'm just scared I'll never see you again.

19:05.024 --> 19:06.724
You will.

19:06.758 --> 19:10.160
This won't be forever. I promise.

19:10.195 --> 19:12.396
I tracked down this joker
once and I'll do it again.

19:14.232 --> 19:16.066
You're my vampire.

19:17.134 --> 19:18.701
And you're my wizard.

19:20.670 --> 19:23.806
OK, now we just gotta get through
the soundproof barrier somehow.

19:23.840 --> 19:25.740
If we wave to the kids.

19:34.682 --> 19:37.250
- I love you, Juliet.
- I love you, Justin.

20:02.506 --> 20:04.906
A vampire minion.

20:04.941 --> 20:07.042
Grow your wings.

20:14.315 --> 20:16.383
Fan me on the way out.

20:17.652 --> 20:19.119
Yes, master.

20:20.789 --> 20:23.123
How fast do those things go?

20:23.158 --> 20:27.495
Forty-five in the country,
25 in the city.

20:27.529 --> 20:30.697
I'll come get you if
it's the last thing I do!

20:50.985 --> 20:52.185
Justin!

20:54.772 --> 20:57.407
Are you OK? I saw
that you were trapped.

20:57.441 --> 21:00.009
What happened? Am I too late?

21:01.278 --> 21:02.779
I let Juliet go with the mummy.

21:02.813 --> 21:05.382
It was the only thing I
could do to save her life.

21:05.416 --> 21:07.751
The only thing you could
do to save her life?

21:10.454 --> 21:13.723
Oh, right. Skylight.

21:13.758 --> 21:18.528
Well, I guess that's something that you
guys are always gonna have to deal with.

21:18.562 --> 21:21.064
I mean, just like
whoever I end up with

21:21.099 --> 21:22.766
is gonna have to
deal with all this.

21:27.938 --> 21:29.605
Wow.

21:29.639 --> 21:31.941
I threw you a lob and
you didn't swing.

21:31.975 --> 21:34.009
You must be pretty upset.

21:35.812 --> 21:37.112
I love her.

21:43.485 --> 21:46.487
Well, you know what they say...

21:48.089 --> 21:50.090
If you love somebody,
set them free.

21:51.359 --> 21:53.093
And if they really love you...

21:54.095 --> 21:55.629
...they'll come back.

21:55.664 --> 21:58.199
Not if they're a
mind-slave to a mummy.

22:00.201 --> 22:04.171
OK, so clearly I'm not as good as
you are making people feel better,

22:04.205 --> 22:06.741
so...

22:08.043 --> 22:12.145
Let's just hug and go get
some cookie dough ice cream.

22:12.179 --> 22:13.913
Cookie dough!

22:15.382 --> 22:16.914
There, there. Let it out.

22:17.983 --> 22:19.617
All right. Hey,
maybe I am good at this.
