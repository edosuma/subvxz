Young one,

00:41.463 --> 00:44.327
your quick thinking
saved many lives today.

00:44.332 --> 00:45.865
Tell us, what is your...

00:49.337 --> 00:52.302
Hey, it's not every day you
get praise from the Avengers.

00:52.307 --> 00:54.427
What's your name? What
are you so afraid of?

00:54.542 --> 00:55.975
Huh?

01:01.149 --> 01:04.114
I'm Iso. And I know
you're working with them,

01:04.119 --> 01:06.149
the National Security Council,

01:06.154 --> 01:08.418
making all us new
Inhumans register.

01:08.423 --> 01:10.220
I came to study
in the U.S.

01:10.225 --> 01:12.322
because I thought
I'd have freedom here.

01:12.327 --> 01:13.859
Turns out I was wrong.

01:16.264 --> 01:18.049
IRON MAN: So, what
do we tell her, Cap,

01:18.097 --> 01:19.295
that Truman Marsh has ordered us

01:19.300 --> 01:21.297
to bring in every
new Inhuman we find,

01:21.302 --> 01:23.600
that that's her reward
for saving all these people?

01:23.605 --> 01:26.202
We have our orders...

01:26.207 --> 01:27.873
But we also have our integrity.

01:28.409 --> 01:29.909
Maybe we can help you.

01:33.181 --> 01:35.178
She isn't the first
new Inhuman we've met

01:35.183 --> 01:36.479
who just wants to be free.

01:36.484 --> 01:39.885
Marsh's regulations only
create more problems.

01:41.456 --> 01:43.520
MARSH: This is unacceptable.

01:43.525 --> 01:45.049
You were given a job.

01:45.097 --> 01:47.174
You wouldn't want people
to ask whose side you're on,

01:47.222 --> 01:48.591
would you, Iron Man?

01:48.596 --> 01:51.394
We're on the side of
what's right, Marsh,

01:51.399 --> 01:53.363
or we aren't Avengers at all.

01:53.368 --> 01:56.167
Let me make this
very simple for you.

01:56.215 --> 02:00.336
Follow your orders, or there
won't be any more Avengers.

02:00.341 --> 02:02.505
What you're asking
us to do isn't justice.

02:02.510 --> 02:04.274
It's your dirty work.

02:04.279 --> 02:06.409
We're done being your pawns.

02:06.414 --> 02:08.908
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Black
Widow's right. As of today,

02:09.002 --> 02:11.817
consider the Avengers
disassembled.

saved a lot of lives today.

05:06.811 --> 05:08.007

05:08.012 --> 05:09.108
Have you checked with Tony?

05:09.113 --> 05:12.011
The Avengers are
more than Tony Stark.

05:12.016 --> 05:14.113
And there's never been

05:14.118 --> 05:16.816

Avengers is a problem,

05:24.996 --> 05:27.160

this is the solution.

welcome to your new home.

05:37.108 --> 05:40.707
Avengers Tower? I don't know.
This doesn't feel right.

05:40.712 --> 05:43.977
Yeah, this isn't just the Avengers HQ.
It's their home.

05:43.982 --> 05:46.779
Kind of feels like
we're intruding.

05:46.784 --> 05:48.982
Really? Well,
I'm all for it.

05:48.987 --> 05:52.752
Those other guys left their
jobs and abandoned this place.

05:52.757 --> 05:54.721
Finders keepers, I say.

05:54.726 --> 05:57.090
Since the Terrigen Mist
created all the new Inhumans,

05:57.095 --> 05:59.125
the world needs Avengers.

05:59.130 --> 06:01.127
The world needs you.

06:01.132 --> 06:03.863
Which means working for you,

06:03.868 --> 06:05.131
registering new Inhumans

06:05.136 --> 06:07.800
and fitting them
with a tracking disk?

06:07.805 --> 06:10.937
Just making sure everyone
is playing by the rules.

06:10.942 --> 06:13.006
We cannot allow those
with powers to run wild

06:13.011 --> 06:15.041
and endanger ordinary citizens.

06:15.046 --> 06:17.844
Since the Inhuman city
of Attilan was destroyed,

06:17.849 --> 06:19.912
everyone's just scared.

06:19.917 --> 06:22.849
But if Black Bolt thinks
registration is necessary

06:22.854 --> 06:25.952
to keep everyone safe,
I guess it's okay.

06:25.957 --> 06:28.855
What if someone doesn't
want to be registered?

06:28.860 --> 06:30.857
That's already happening.

06:30.862 --> 06:32.992
People won't go
down without a fight,

06:32.997 --> 06:35.862
which is what I am
now ready to have.

06:45.977 --> 06:47.874

such pathetic replacements.

you showing up here

after your last smack-down,
Baron Strucker.

07:53.911 --> 07:55.942

took you out. (LAUGHS)

stop my Hydra soldiers.

than stand with the villains.

11:41.689 --> 11:42.985
We aren't running.

11:42.990 --> 11:45.521
It's just that sometimes
you can't see the answer

11:45.526 --> 11:47.556
without getting some
distance from the problem.

11:47.561 --> 11:49.525
You know, it's
time to stop this.

11:49.530 --> 11:52.330
Cap, how about we pay
a visit to Marsh's bosses?

11:54.935 --> 11:57.900
<i>Who do you think you are to summon
us in the middle of the night?</i>

11:57.905 --> 12:00.703
<i>Especially after you refused
to follow government orders.</i>

12:00.708 --> 12:02.705
You mean Marsh's orders.

12:02.710 --> 12:04.807
Look, we're hoping to
find some common ground.

12:04.812 --> 12:07.743
You can't rely on force
alone to keep the peace.

12:07.748 --> 12:11.514
Your Inhuman registration campaign
is causing fear and resentment.

12:11.519 --> 12:13.883
Now we even have heroes
on opposite sides.

12:13.888 --> 12:15.718
Maybe it's time to rethink this.

12:15.723 --> 12:18.123
<i>You do not understand
the big picture.</i>

12:18.526 --> 12:19.789
So fill us in!

12:19.794 --> 12:22.027
<i>You know what you need to know.</i>

12:22.963 --> 12:26.298
Trying to deal with bureaucrats
is always a waste of time.

12:27.835 --> 12:29.301
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

12:30.905 --> 12:33.569
<i>Look, there are those
of us who agree with you.</i>

12:33.574 --> 12:35.738
<i>These new Inhumans
need your help.</i>

12:35.743 --> 12:37.807
And how do we do that?
<i>There's a raid planned</i>

12:37.812 --> 12:40.576
<i>on some Inhumans who
are resisting registration.</i>

12:40.581 --> 12:41.777
<i>Tomorrow night.</i>

12:41.782 --> 12:44.880
<i>Marsh is sending
the Mighty Avengers.</i>

12:44.885 --> 12:47.319
<i>I'll send you a secure
message with the location.</i>

12:48.789 --> 12:51.022
(SIGHS) Do we trust him?

13:01.769 --> 13:03.733
It matches the
coordinates I was sent.

13:03.738 --> 13:05.601
I'll scout ahead alone.

13:05.606 --> 13:07.703
If they see the whole team, they'll
think we're here to round 'em up.

13:07.708 --> 13:09.705
I can warn them about the raid before...
(RUMBLING)

13:09.710 --> 13:12.508
Earthquake?
It's too localized.

13:12.513 --> 13:14.710
I have no idea
what it is! Whoa!

13:14.715 --> 13:16.115
(YELLS)

13:20.588 --> 13:21.988
It's me!

13:25.926 --> 13:27.326
Huh?
Huh?

13:28.696 --> 13:29.925
(SNARLING)

13:29.930 --> 13:31.660
Hulk, you got this?

13:31.665 --> 13:33.065
No problem!

13:36.704 --> 13:38.701
(ROARING)
Stop!

13:38.706 --> 13:41.039
Haechi, they're not the enemy.

13:41.709 --> 13:42.938
I heard they gave up.

13:42.943 --> 13:44.640
But now they've come for us!

13:44.645 --> 13:45.975
Flint! No!

13:45.980 --> 13:47.610
(GRUNTS)

13:47.615 --> 13:49.214
That look like giving up?

13:50.684 --> 13:52.515
(GROWLS)

13:52.520 --> 13:54.750
Hey, hold on, kid!
We're on your side!

13:54.755 --> 13:56.188
(ROARS)

14:00.561 --> 14:02.691
Someone's gonna
get hurt or worse.

14:02.696 --> 14:04.593
These kids need a time out.

14:04.598 --> 14:06.158
ISO: And you
need to back off.

14:06.667 --> 14:08.067
(GROWLS)

14:11.672 --> 14:13.669
Oh! The air...

14:13.674 --> 14:15.838
Is fighting back!

14:15.843 --> 14:19.945
I control the air.
Is this what you meant to do?

14:21.615 --> 14:23.148
THOR: Enough!

14:31.859 --> 14:33.656
They know you're here.

14:33.661 --> 14:35.061
They're coming for you.

14:36.697 --> 14:39.495
Wait! Why would
they warn us?

14:39.500 --> 14:41.100
Maybe we should hear them out.

14:41.769 --> 14:44.567
Could have turned you
in before, but we didn't.

14:44.572 --> 14:46.735
(AIRCRAFT WHIRRING)

14:46.740 --> 14:48.537
Just go. We'll hold
them off as long as we...

14:48.542 --> 14:51.607
MS. MARVEL: Inhumans,
we've come to register you.

14:51.612 --> 14:52.842
You will not be harmed,

14:52.847 --> 14:56.281
as long as you and the
ex-Avengers do not resist!

14:57.551 --> 15:00.316
Danver

15:00.321 --> 15:02.585
It doesn't have to go like this.

15:02.590 --> 15:05.421
Seriously, are we all
working together again?

15:05.426 --> 15:08.290
(GIGGLES) This is great!
They're not here to help.

15:08.295 --> 15:11.193
We are here to help,
just not you.

15:11.198 --> 15:14.296
It appears that you've
located fugitive Inhumans.

15:14.301 --> 15:16.968
Our orders are to report
them for registration.

15:20.307 --> 15:21.907
Huh? What?

15:22.409 --> 15:23.439
(GAS HISSING)

15:23.444 --> 15:25.574
I don't see any
Inhumans. Do you?

15:25.579 --> 15:27.443
Come on. Let's go!

15:27.448 --> 15:30.246
MS. MARVEL: This isn't some simplistic
fight between good and evil.

15:30.251 --> 15:32.214
There are real stakes here.

15:32.219 --> 15:35.451
Whatever you think you're doing,
Captain Rogers, stand down.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.286
I know exactly what we're doing.

15:37.291 --> 15:39.221
And until today, I would
have sworn on my life

15:39.226 --> 15:41.156
you'd be on the same side.

15:41.161 --> 15:44.527
You cannot disobey the law just
because you have super-powers.

15:44.532 --> 15:47.229
You don't know what it's
like to be different.

15:47.234 --> 15:48.597
To be hunted.

15:48.602 --> 15:52.468
You know what they call a guy
with powers that breaks the law?

15:52.473 --> 15:54.470
(GUN COCKS)
A super-villain.

15:54.475 --> 15:57.842
Whoever's on my side better
get behind me right now.

15:58.412 --> 16:00.092
If that's the way you want it...

16:04.385 --> 16:06.651
Wait, why do I get Hulk?

16:08.556 --> 16:11.487
Don't do this.
Don't make us do this.

16:11.492 --> 16:13.491
Let's do this!

16:15.195 --> 16:16.595
No!

16:25.139 --> 16:26.535
THOR: I do not
wish to hurt you.

16:26.540 --> 16:30.542
But if it is a fight you want,
you shall have one to remember!

16:33.614 --> 16:35.513
(GRUNTS)

16:42.389 --> 16:43.586
(WHIRRING)

16:43.591 --> 16:46.288
Whoa! Anyone else
want to take Thor?

16:46.293 --> 16:48.593
Anyone? (SCREAMS)

16:49.263 --> 16:50.663
(GRUNTS)

16:51.298 --> 16:53.462
Look, kid, we don't
have to fight.

16:53.467 --> 16:54.933
We could work this out.

16:57.204 --> 16:58.604
Owie.

17:09.148 --> 17:10.549
(GRUNTS)

17:11.452 --> 17:13.482
This is a waste of
our talents, Stark.

17:13.487 --> 17:16.755
We are leaders of men,
not petty combatants.

17:17.590 --> 17:19.523
(BOTH GRUNTING)

17:20.327 --> 17:23.157
Where'd he go?
Friday, take a memo.

17:23.163 --> 17:24.393
Stealth Mode.

17:24.397 --> 17:25.896
I have got...
(GRUNTS)

17:30.371 --> 17:31.771
My wings!

17:43.150 --> 17:44.480
Get out of there, you bug!

17:44.485 --> 17:46.951
You're not seeing the
big picture, Falcon.

17:50.457 --> 17:52.187
(GASPS)

17:52.192 --> 17:53.255
(GROWLS)

17:53.260 --> 17:55.224
Wait! You were right.

17:55.229 --> 17:56.425
We don't have to fight.

17:56.430 --> 17:58.596
Um...
Sucker punch!

18:03.337 --> 18:04.769
(CHUCKLES)

18:05.406 --> 18:07.202

18:07.207 --> 18:09.505
You got nothin', bow-man.

18:09.510 --> 18:11.843
Oh, I got a little something.

18:13.113 --> 18:14.546
(GROANING)

18:18.285 --> 18:20.249
When I agreed to be a hero,

18:20.254 --> 18:22.418
I didn't think
it'd be like this.

18:22.423 --> 18:25.487
You don't always get to pick your battles.
It's just that...

18:25.492 --> 18:27.356
I get what we're doing here, but

18:27.361 --> 18:29.591
I don't like
fighting my friends.

18:29.596 --> 18:31.393
It just doesn't feel right.

18:31.398 --> 18:32.628
Kind of the same feeling you had

18:32.633 --> 18:34.866
when you were part
of the Masters of Evil?

18:36.236 --> 18:38.570
You don't have to
follow their rules.

18:39.139 --> 18:40.839
You can decide for yourself.

18:42.609 --> 18:44.306
I can.

18:44.311 --> 18:45.743
And I do.

18:49.483 --> 18:51.783
(ROARING) No!

18:53.587 --> 18:55.384
What are you doing?

18:55.389 --> 18:57.219
What's right... Finally.

18:57.224 --> 18:58.624
(GRUNTING)

19:01.361 --> 19:02.894
(GRUNTING)

19:07.568 --> 19:09.734
(BOTH GRUNTING)

19:16.143 --> 19:18.474
Even if we win, we've hurt
the people we care about.

19:18.479 --> 19:20.209
We just need a better plan.

19:20.214 --> 19:23.178
If I buy you some time,
you think you can get away?

19:23.183 --> 19:24.513
Run away in the
middle of a fight?

19:24.518 --> 19:26.315
You're not running away.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.450
You're getting some distance
to come up with a solution.

19:28.455 --> 19:31.120
I think it's all we've got.

19:31.125 --> 19:33.491
Okay, but I'll be back.

19:43.237 --> 19:44.466
That's one.

19:44.471 --> 19:45.904
(BOTH GRUNTING)

19:47.141 --> 19:48.541
That's two.

19:51.545 --> 19:52.608
(GRUNTS)

19:52.613 --> 19:54.913
And three.
Go, Natasha.

19:57.251 --> 19:58.883
We're all counting on you.

19:59.419 --> 20:00.819
(GRUNTS)

20:02.623 --> 20:04.756
This ends now!

20:07.594 --> 20:09.827
By Odin's beard!

20:13.267 --> 20:14.667
(GROANS)

20:15.502 --> 20:16.902
Cap's down!

20:20.374 --> 20:22.638
Cap!
Cap! Get up!

20:22.643 --> 20:25.374
Get up, Captain Rogers.

20:25.379 --> 20:26.642
That's an order!

20:26.647 --> 20:30.445
BLACK PANTHER: Enough!
This battle is over.

20:30.450 --> 20:33.382
Come on, Steve.
Just hang in there.

20:33.387 --> 20:37.319
How can you act like you care about
Cap now? This is all your fault!

20:37.324 --> 20:39.555
No. The fault is my own.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.557
I called this man a friend,

20:41.562 --> 20:43.592
and now I have struck
him down in battle.

20:43.597 --> 20:47.563
Marsh gave us orders,
and they're still in effect.

20:47.568 --> 20:50.265
Take them into custody,
and get Cap to a medic.

20:50.270 --> 20:51.703
Pronto!

20:55.509 --> 20:57.372
(GROWLING)

20:57.377 --> 20:59.374
Let 'em do what
they gotta do, Hulk,

20:59.379 --> 21:01.543
as long as it gets
Cap to a doctor.

21:01.548 --> 21:03.579
This is, like,
totally embarrassing,

21:03.584 --> 21:05.750
but I'm really still a big fan.

21:08.522 --> 21:10.285
Where is Romanoff?

21:10.290 --> 21:11.453
Where is Black Widow?

21:11.458 --> 21:14.323
Natasha? (CHUCKLES) Good luck.

21:14.328 --> 21:16.558
You don't find her unless
she wants to be found.

21:16.563 --> 21:19.361
And by then, it'll
be too late for you.

21:19.366 --> 21:20.596
It doesn't matter.

21:20.601 --> 21:24.600
What can one person do that
the entire Avengers can't?
