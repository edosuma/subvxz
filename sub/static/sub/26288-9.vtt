00:04.613 --> 00:07.181
[birds chirping,
frogs croaking]

00:17.843 --> 00:19.367
Norton, what is it?

00:20.803 --> 00:24.241
Just stay here.

00:37.689 --> 00:39.256
Hey! Stop!

00:42.651 --> 00:44.218
Hurry up!

01:14.857 --> 01:15.858
Got you.

01:16.859 --> 01:18.861
â™ª

01:47.194 --> 01:48.978
[indistinct announcements
on P.A.]

01:59.336 --> 02:01.295
What are you doing?

02:01.338 --> 02:04.298
Do you know it's impossible
to lick your own elbow?

02:05.429 --> 02:07.301
Know the first novel
ever written

02:07.344 --> 02:09.390
on a typewriter
was Tom Sawyer.

02:09.433 --> 02:12.001
How about the first couple
to be shown in bed together

02:12.044 --> 02:13.176
on prime time TV?

02:13.220 --> 02:14.612
It's Fred and Wilma Flintstone.

02:14.656 --> 02:16.919
Where are you getting this?

02:16.962 --> 02:19.704
Oh, right here.
List of "Did You Knows?"

02:19.748 --> 02:21.402
Waiting gets boring, so...

02:21.445 --> 02:24.274
sometimes I like
to bring something to read.

02:24.318 --> 02:26.320
GIBBS:
Yeah. Well, maybe

02:26.363 --> 02:28.539
we don't need
to wait any longer.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.721
Eh, not her.

02:36.765 --> 02:38.201
You know,
I'll never get it.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.376
I mean, she would've done
a lot less time

02:39.420 --> 02:40.769
if she just gave up
her accomplice.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.292
Yeah, but she didn't.

02:42.336 --> 02:44.425
And he got away with hundreds

02:44.468 --> 02:46.644
of thousands of dollars.

02:46.688 --> 02:48.342
Which, I know, still bugs you.

02:49.604 --> 02:51.301
And rightly so.

02:51.345 --> 02:53.085
I get it,
it's more than that.

02:56.132 --> 02:57.394
Uh, bingo.

02:57.438 --> 03:00.441
Angie, Angie, Angie...

03:00.484 --> 03:03.095
let's see where you are going.

03:07.317 --> 03:10.102
McGEE:
I can't see the driver.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.974
No license plate.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.454
Yeah, how convenient.

03:13.497 --> 03:15.195
Think that's the accomplice?

03:15.238 --> 03:18.285
That'd be too easy.

03:36.259 --> 03:38.218
Thanks.

03:53.842 --> 03:56.845
Boss, stakeout time.

04:04.113 --> 04:06.202
It's Italian. Cashmere.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.509
I never wore cashmere before.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.380
Want to feel it?

04:10.424 --> 04:12.034
W-W-Wait.
Your hands are clean, right?

04:12.077 --> 04:13.905
Ooh, nice, Nick.

04:13.949 --> 04:16.168
Feels sort of like
my cat, Moofie.

04:17.822 --> 04:20.434
Ooh. McGee.
He needs photo recognition.

04:20.477 --> 04:23.219
And the hunt begins.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.351
Hey, uh, Ellie.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.048
You were here
three years ago.

04:26.091 --> 04:27.484
Why is Gibbs so into this case?

04:27.528 --> 04:30.400
Loose ends
and unanswered questions--

04:30.444 --> 04:32.272
Gibbs doesn't like 'em.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.795
Hmm.

04:33.838 --> 04:36.101
Hey, uh, it's time to
relieve Gibbs and McGee,

04:36.145 --> 04:38.365
cashmere boy.

04:41.063 --> 04:43.457
I appreciate you confiding
in me, Director.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.286
And I hope following that girl
leads to finding her accomplice.

04:46.329 --> 04:48.723
But I must share,
I have concerns.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.464
Oh?

04:50.507 --> 04:52.292
The break-in was
traumatic for my wife.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.032
She's had trouble sleeping
ever since,

04:54.076 --> 04:55.512
and I don't want
the investigation

04:55.556 --> 04:57.253
to stir up any bad
memories for her.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.951
Mm. Well, I certainly can
understand that, Admiral.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.779
I'll keep you in the loop

05:01.823 --> 05:03.564
and I'll be sure to keep her
out of it.

05:03.607 --> 05:04.565
Appreciate that.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.088
This way.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.412
Got it.

05:25.455 --> 05:27.849
If she tries to slip out
the back, we'll see her.

05:29.677 --> 05:32.462
[Torres and Bishop
speaking Spanish]

05:44.779 --> 05:46.955
Torres, there a problem?Damn right there is.

05:46.998 --> 05:50.654
The car the motor pool gave us
reeks like a sewer.

05:50.698 --> 05:53.004
Smells like a dude,
uh, blew chunks,

05:53.048 --> 05:54.397
or even worse,
in the back seat.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.268
It's not very pleasant.

05:56.312 --> 05:59.576
Ooh! Ooh,
your sweater stinks, man.

06:00.577 --> 06:01.970
No.Yeah.

06:03.406 --> 06:04.842
Come on, McGee.
Let's get out of here.

06:04.886 --> 06:07.105
Bishop, laptop's got
the rear entrance covered.

06:07.149 --> 06:08.585
Got it.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.550
Spent half my paycheck
on this one.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.914
Hey, Bishop.

06:32.957 --> 06:34.437
Good news.Mm.

06:34.481 --> 06:37.309
I found a convenience store
down the block.

06:37.353 --> 06:39.486
Fabric freshener.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.009
Ah, good for you.

06:44.491 --> 06:47.058
Hey. She's leaving.TORRES: Hmm.

06:57.591 --> 06:58.940
Thanks.

07:03.945 --> 07:06.948
TORRES:
Hold up, hold up--
who's that guy?

07:10.865 --> 07:13.389
Well, I know why we're tailing
Angie, but why is he?

07:43.854 --> 07:45.421
TORRES:
You got this?

07:45.465 --> 07:46.770
BISHOP:
Yeah.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.342
GIBBS:
That's what got her convicted.

07:53.385 --> 07:54.691
Pretty damning.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.171
Victims of
the theft:

07:56.214 --> 07:59.043
Admiral Norton Padgett
and his wife.SLOANE: Hmm.

07:59.087 --> 08:01.306
Nice house. Nice wheels.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.570
VANCE:
Mm-hmm. Their lifestyle
was not because of

08:03.613 --> 08:05.136
his admiral's pay.

08:05.180 --> 08:08.792
Oh, no. They earned that the
old-fashioned way: inheritance.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.315
From his wife's side.And, trust me,

08:10.359 --> 08:12.883
the robbery didn't
change their lives one bit.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.711
Wait, do I sense that you two

08:14.755 --> 08:16.496
aren't totally sympathetic
with the Padgetts?

08:16.539 --> 08:19.107
Well, let's just say
that Admiral Padgett

08:19.150 --> 08:21.588
tried to throw his weight around
during the investigation.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.459
Well, having read the file,

08:23.503 --> 08:25.592
I'm intrigued with Angie Gray.

08:25.635 --> 08:28.595
Why didn't she take the deal
the prosecutor offered her

08:28.638 --> 08:30.335
and why wouldn't she name
her accomplice?

08:30.379 --> 08:33.469
I don't know. You tell us.I'm gonna try.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.689
She would've got a lot less
jail time.

08:35.732 --> 08:38.561
You know, the writer in me is a
romantic, so I always theorized

08:38.605 --> 08:40.258
that the accomplice was
Angie Gray's boyfriend,

08:40.302 --> 08:42.652
who she believed would wait
for her with the money.

08:42.696 --> 08:44.654
SLOANE:
File indicates
that Angie Gray

08:44.698 --> 08:48.484
was a troubled teen
with a juvie record

08:48.528 --> 08:51.618
for a break-in robbery
with an old boyfriend.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.750
San Diego, as I recall.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.622
My old port.

08:55.665 --> 08:56.666
GIBBS:
Yeah.

08:56.710 --> 08:59.190
Maybe you could "accidentally"

08:59.234 --> 09:02.106
bump into her
and do your profile thing.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.718
Sounds so easy
when you say it.

09:04.761 --> 09:07.198
I'll see what I can do.

09:07.242 --> 09:08.939
All right.
I got to get to the airport.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.811
I will be back in a couple days.

09:10.854 --> 09:13.422
Please have some
good news for me.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.555
Gibbs, let's finally
put this one to rest.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.600
Right.

09:17.644 --> 09:18.993
JIMMY:
You don't know Huey?

09:19.036 --> 09:21.430
Uh, no. I've never been
to the motor pool.

09:21.473 --> 09:23.954
Huh. Well, it doesn't matter.
Huey's the dispatcher.

09:23.998 --> 09:26.653
He's the one that issues
cars to all the agents.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.568
Now, it seems that he
gave Bishop and Torres

09:28.611 --> 09:30.395
a car that was just foul.Hmm.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.049
Like, the smell was so bad

09:32.093 --> 09:34.835
it permeated Nick's
brand-new cashmere sweater.

09:34.878 --> 09:35.966
Wait, where'd you
hear this from?

09:36.010 --> 09:37.489
I bumped into Huey.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.491
He told me Nick called
him, berated him.

09:39.535 --> 09:41.972
Oh. Sounds like the Seinfeld
"Smelly Car" episode.

09:42.016 --> 09:43.844
Exactly. The odor
just penetrated everything

09:43.887 --> 09:45.454
it came in contact with.

09:45.497 --> 09:47.717
Oh, poor Nick.
He loves that sweater.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.066
Give me an update.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.807
Oh, on the case,
not the sweater.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.200
Mm. Aye, aye.

09:55.551 --> 09:58.423
Meet Lanny Peete.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.425
Three robbery convictions.
The first, as a juvenile,

10:00.469 --> 10:03.298
didn't get her any time.
The second and third

10:03.341 --> 10:05.517
sent her away for years.
Relevantly,

10:05.561 --> 10:06.997
she was also
Angie Gray's cellmate

10:07.041 --> 10:08.695
for two and a half years.

10:08.738 --> 10:11.088
She was finally released
on parole five months ago.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.395
Well, the two of them might be
after the missing money

10:13.438 --> 10:16.267
for themselves.As for this guy, he turns out
to be Phillip Iverson,

10:16.311 --> 10:17.617
a local P.I.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.793
Yeah. I heard the name.
Questionable rep.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.969
A private investigator.
What's up with that?

10:22.012 --> 10:23.448
We're gonna find out.

10:25.015 --> 10:26.495
Oh, it's Ducky.

10:27.888 --> 10:28.889
Dr. Mallard.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.455
Good evening, Kasie.

10:30.499 --> 10:32.675
I'm looking for Dr. Palmer.
Is he with you?

10:32.719 --> 10:35.504
He certainly is.
Where are you?

10:35.547 --> 10:37.245
I'm on my way to the airport.

10:37.288 --> 10:39.247
I'm flying
from Reagan to Chicago,

10:39.290 --> 10:41.989
where I get a flight
to Rapid City tomorrow.

10:42.032 --> 10:44.992
It's the nearest airport
to Mount Rushmore.

10:45.035 --> 10:47.081
We're so excited for you.

10:47.124 --> 10:49.866
For a history buff like you,
it should be something special.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.868
Well, I-I just called
to say goodbye.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.044
But I-I'm curious
about one thing.

10:54.088 --> 10:57.831
I read in the newspaper
that the Gray woman

10:57.874 --> 11:00.790
was released this morning
from prison.

11:00.834 --> 11:03.924
Remembering how Gibbs felt
about that case,

11:03.967 --> 11:06.883
I suspect he's back on it again?

11:06.927 --> 11:09.190
You would suspect correctly.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.149
Have a wonderful
trip, Dr. Mallard.

11:12.193 --> 11:15.500
Uh, thank you.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.852
Thanks.You got it.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.507
BISHOP: Hello?Hey.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.509
Angie just bought
a prepaid cell.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.163
Okay. Thanks.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.386
Wonder who she's gonna call.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.831
It's Angie Gray.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.703
Call me back on this number.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.748
We need to talk.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.924
Shoot.

11:47.968 --> 11:50.405
Hey, uh, ex-excuse me.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.146
This is a little
awkward, but

11:52.189 --> 11:54.191
could I borrow
your phone, please?

11:54.235 --> 11:57.281
My battery died, and I
need to reach someone.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.283
You'll totally
be saving my life.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.764
I won't be long, I promise.

12:01.808 --> 12:04.462
Mm.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.508
Aw, thank you so much.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.688
Hello?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.734
SLOANE:
Hey there. Hi. I'm so sorry,

12:14.777 --> 12:16.779
but I need to, uh...
I need to cancel lunch.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.782
I had an emergency.
I, uh... I'm at... I'm at

12:19.826 --> 12:22.785
the, uh... airport

12:22.829 --> 12:25.483
headed to San Diego.

12:25.527 --> 12:26.789
Jack, what's going on?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.660
Yeah. I'm sorry again.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.837
I'll call you
back tonight. Okay.

12:32.577 --> 12:35.537
Sloane made contact.Good.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.626
Thank you. I really
appreciate it.

12:37.669 --> 12:40.324
I, uh, save your life?

12:40.368 --> 12:43.197
I... Just a little lie
to get out of a date

12:43.240 --> 12:44.676
I should have never made.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.809
Oh. You said San Diego?

12:46.853 --> 12:50.421
Yeah.I'm from San Diego.
Well, La Mesa, actually.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.336
Oh, yeah?Yeah.

12:52.380 --> 12:53.729
I-I know the area well. I, uh,

12:53.773 --> 12:55.818
spent a lot of time
at Camp Pendleton.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.081
You don't look
like the military type.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.083
Navy or Marines?

13:00.127 --> 13:02.869
Army, actually.
It's a long story.

13:02.912 --> 13:05.741
I'm sure you don't want
to hear it, but I really

13:05.785 --> 13:08.744
loved my time there,
especially the beaches.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.224
Sunset Cliffs?

13:10.267 --> 13:12.617
Are you kidding?
My favorite.

13:12.661 --> 13:15.620
I'd surf there whenever
I had the chance.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.622
I wish I was there
right now, actually.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.624
It's a lot warmer.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.670
Mm.

13:27.502 --> 13:28.808
And he is back.

13:33.377 --> 13:34.726
What's he doing?

13:36.032 --> 13:38.034
I got a good idea.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.255
Right here.
Watch this.

13:41.298 --> 13:42.647
Wait for it.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.563
Wait for it.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.739
Boom.Okay,

13:47.783 --> 13:50.612
what do we do?

13:50.655 --> 13:51.787
We don't want
to blow our cover.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.441
Bishop, what if he's
here to kill her?

13:53.484 --> 13:55.878
I-I say we wait
until she comes back.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.445
And then what?

13:57.488 --> 14:00.883
And then, if he's still
in there, then, you know...

14:03.320 --> 14:04.800
She is back.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.644
â™ª

14:35.787 --> 14:37.920
Hey.Hey. Hey.

14:37.964 --> 14:40.618
Uh, Iverson, the P.I.,
snuck around back.

14:40.662 --> 14:41.706
He's waiting inside for her.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.622
We got to go inside.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.886
Go. I'll call Gibbs.

15:01.422 --> 15:03.641
â™ª

15:13.086 --> 15:14.261
What happened?

15:14.304 --> 15:15.827
I don't know.

15:15.871 --> 15:17.133
Maybe she killed him.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.656
Ah. Or maybe we
got it wrong.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.049
She went to get ice?

15:20.093 --> 15:21.224
Maybe he's not
even in there.

15:35.847 --> 15:38.067
What did or didn't happen
in there?

15:46.032 --> 15:49.470
Well, at least we didn't
blow our cover.

15:51.863 --> 15:55.084
Ms. Peete,
appreciate your coming in.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.347
I'm Special Agent McGee.
We talked on the phone.

15:57.391 --> 16:00.568
Yeah, and you weren't very clear
what this is all about.

16:00.611 --> 16:02.309
Angie Gray.

16:02.352 --> 16:05.138
Please have a seat.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.578
You, uh... you
were her cellmate

16:10.621 --> 16:12.362
for over two years.

16:12.406 --> 16:15.017
We're hoping you can
give us some help.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.585
Help you how?Well, give us
some insight.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.195
See, it's unusual for someone

16:19.239 --> 16:21.154
to turn down a plea bargain
like Angie did.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.634
You'll never get any argument
from me on that.

16:23.678 --> 16:26.637
Hmm. So what'd she say?

16:26.681 --> 16:29.162
About the robbery.
You must have talked.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.860
Yeah, we talked.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.340
And?

16:33.383 --> 16:35.733
Why don't you ask Angie
your questions?

16:35.777 --> 16:37.735
Well, the truth is,
we're concerned.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.737
We're afraid she might go back

16:39.781 --> 16:41.348
to hanging
with the wrong people.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.437
You got that right.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.353
Angie's got bad instincts,
you know what I mean?

16:46.396 --> 16:48.007
Not exactly.

16:48.050 --> 16:51.488
Let's just say
I had to protect her.

16:51.532 --> 16:53.142
From who?

16:53.186 --> 16:54.752
People who'd
take advantage of her.

16:54.796 --> 16:57.103
Like the guy
she was with on the robbery?

16:57.146 --> 16:58.756
That lowlife used Angie.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.671
He knew she would
do anything for him,

17:00.715 --> 17:02.543
and that bastard
let her take the rap.

17:02.586 --> 17:05.111
Could never understand
why she didn't give him up.

17:05.154 --> 17:08.244
Angie has a way
of picking the wrong guys.Really?

17:08.288 --> 17:11.639
J.T. wasn't the first boyfriend
to get her in trouble.J.T.?

17:11.682 --> 17:14.076
You hear a last name?Nope.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.687
For what it's worth,
she didn't know him very long.

17:16.731 --> 17:18.733
What does she think
happened to him?

17:18.776 --> 17:21.649
Look...

17:21.692 --> 17:23.781
there's really no more
I can tell you.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.957
You sure?

17:28.003 --> 17:30.136
All right.
Appreciate it, Lanny.

17:32.225 --> 17:33.748
Oh, uh, one more thing.

17:33.791 --> 17:36.098
Now that she's on parole,
you gonna go see Angie?

17:36.142 --> 17:39.101
I picked her up
yesterday morning.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.930
ANGIE:
You have me

17:41.973 --> 17:43.584
on the security camera.

17:43.627 --> 17:46.108
I drove the car away.
I can't deny it.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.328
GIBBS:
You can spend a lot less time--

17:48.371 --> 17:51.548
maybe no time at all--
in jail,

17:51.592 --> 17:54.812
if you tell us who
you were with, Angie.

17:58.425 --> 18:01.123
Want to help you,
but you have to help us.

18:01.167 --> 18:04.387
I guarantee,
not gonna get away.

18:04.431 --> 18:07.608
We're gonna find out
who your accomplice is.

18:07.651 --> 18:11.264
You got your whole
life ahead of you.

18:11.307 --> 18:14.136
Don't make it
harder on yourself.

18:16.269 --> 18:18.923
Think about it, okay?

18:24.190 --> 18:26.670
McGEE:
Hey, no guy is worth it.

18:26.714 --> 18:29.456
You think he's gonna
wait for you, cut you in?

18:29.499 --> 18:32.415
It's hard to believe.
It's more likely...

18:32.459 --> 18:34.939
Shut up.

18:34.983 --> 18:37.942
Look, I'm just telling
you the truth here, okay?

18:39.901 --> 18:41.120
Come in.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.209
Hey.Hey.

18:43.252 --> 18:45.124
So, remember when you called me

18:45.167 --> 18:47.213
from Angie Gray's cell phone?Mm-hmm.

18:47.256 --> 18:48.823
I got the number,
and I was able

18:48.866 --> 18:51.173
to trace the prior call she made
from the bus bench.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.523
And?And it belonged

18:53.567 --> 18:56.047
to a Lew-- L-E-W Nolte--

18:56.091 --> 18:58.398
who-- get this--
was a suspect in the case

18:58.441 --> 18:59.747
three years ago.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.488
Wow.Oh, yeah.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.359
He was Admiral Padgett's
personal assistant.

19:03.403 --> 19:05.579
He did, like, odds and
ends around the estate.

19:05.622 --> 19:07.624
And we always thought

19:07.668 --> 19:09.496
that he was an inside man
in the robbery,

19:09.539 --> 19:10.845
but we could never prove it.

19:10.888 --> 19:12.542
And Angie Gray gets out of jail,

19:12.586 --> 19:14.849
and the first call
she makes is to him.

19:14.892 --> 19:18.374
Mm-hmm. I am going to anticipate
Gibbs and bring him in.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.159
Hey, Ellie,

19:20.202 --> 19:23.205
what's with Gibbs
and this case, anyway?

19:23.249 --> 19:25.947
The way he handled her
in interrogation--

19:25.990 --> 19:27.644
I've never seen him so soft.

19:27.688 --> 19:29.994
Yeah. Uh,

19:30.038 --> 19:32.345
Gibbs was friends
with her father.

19:32.388 --> 19:34.869
He, uh, was killed
in Afghanistan.

19:34.912 --> 19:37.785
Uh, yeah, by an I.E.D.
I read that.

19:37.828 --> 19:41.267
Yeah. Gibbs tried to help her,
but... she wouldn't listen.

19:47.664 --> 19:48.883
Hey, Tim?

19:48.926 --> 19:50.319
I think that fabric freshener

19:50.363 --> 19:51.842
killed my sweater.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.237
It still stinks.

19:55.281 --> 19:56.586
It's all lumpy.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.458
Well, did you read
the warnings on the label?

19:58.501 --> 20:00.242
Yeah.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.505
Sort of.

20:02.549 --> 20:03.898
Huey's gonna pay for this.

20:05.682 --> 20:06.683
She's leaving.

20:24.745 --> 20:25.659
Hey.

20:25.702 --> 20:28.705
Whoa. Whoa,
whoa, whoa...

20:28.749 --> 20:30.316
NCIS?

20:30.359 --> 20:31.926
Turn it off.

20:36.757 --> 20:39.281
What do you want?Answers.

20:39.325 --> 20:42.066
I-I'm on a job, man.
I'm working.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.546
Oh, yeah. That's one
of the questions

20:43.590 --> 20:44.852
I was gonna ask you.
For who?

20:44.895 --> 20:46.810
Again, what do you want?

20:46.854 --> 20:50.684
Again... who you working for?

20:50.727 --> 20:52.555
None of your business.

20:52.599 --> 20:53.643
Okay.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.341
Look...

20:55.384 --> 20:57.343
Iverson?

20:57.386 --> 20:59.780
I don't much like P.I.s,

20:59.823 --> 21:02.435
especially ones
with shady reputations.

21:02.478 --> 21:03.958
Yeah, well, um,

21:04.001 --> 21:05.264
screw you.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.831
Okay.

21:07.875 --> 21:11.444
Who hired you
to tail Angie Gray?

21:11.487 --> 21:14.229
A client.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.188
Paid me to follow her

21:17.232 --> 21:19.582
and report back
who she met with.

21:19.626 --> 21:21.889
Didn't tell me why.

21:21.932 --> 21:24.108
And, as you know,
I don't have to reveal his name.

21:24.152 --> 21:26.502
'Kay?

21:26.546 --> 21:28.852
Yeah. Okay. For now.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.944
She got away.

21:41.256 --> 21:43.911
I thought NCIS
would be out of my life.

21:43.954 --> 21:45.216
They are.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.218
I told you. It was
all about J.T.

21:47.262 --> 21:49.308
They're obviously
still looking for him.

21:49.351 --> 21:52.093
Damn. This place
looks worse than you described.

21:52.136 --> 21:54.356
J.T. said his grandfather
built it himself.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.097
After he got back
from the war.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.969
What war?

21:59.013 --> 22:00.623
He brought me here
one weekend.

22:05.062 --> 22:06.325
It's locked.

22:06.368 --> 22:08.762
Yeah. Can't see a thing.

22:08.805 --> 22:10.546
Yeah. Doesn't look like
anybody's been here

22:10.590 --> 22:12.853
in a long time.Yeah.

22:12.896 --> 22:14.115
So what do you want to do?

22:14.158 --> 22:15.638
Break in.

22:15.682 --> 22:16.726
I figured you'd say that.

22:16.770 --> 22:18.424
All we need is to get caught.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.556
Hey, give me that.

22:26.562 --> 22:28.651
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, careful.

22:28.695 --> 22:29.826
Don't cut yourself.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.619
Man, this place smells terrible.

22:39.662 --> 22:42.230
Who knows when he was here last.

22:42.273 --> 22:44.014
I'm just hoping
we'll find something

22:44.058 --> 22:45.276
that'll tell us
where he is.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.843
Like what?

22:46.887 --> 22:49.193
I don't know.

23:01.423 --> 23:03.164
Let's get out of sight.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.350
Could've saved the B and E.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.134
There's a back door,
and it wasn't locked.

23:24.054 --> 23:25.708
Hey, Tim,
you ever want a cabin?

23:25.752 --> 23:27.188
Not really.

23:27.231 --> 23:29.495
Yeah, me neither.
I'm a city guy.

23:29.538 --> 23:31.497
I never got people
who said, uh,

23:31.540 --> 23:33.412
"Oh, I want to get away
from it all."

23:33.455 --> 23:34.891
Yeah, it's like Gibbs.

23:34.935 --> 23:36.937
Says he enjoys the
peace and quiet.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.246
Let's go.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.868
Is it him?Um,

23:54.911 --> 23:56.696
I can't tell.All right,

23:56.739 --> 23:58.654
come on, Angie, come here. I
don't want you looking at that.

23:58.698 --> 24:00.874
It's J.T.'s cabin.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.528
You said he let other people
stay here, right?

24:02.571 --> 24:04.399
What do we do?

24:04.443 --> 24:06.183
Why the scream, Lanny?

24:06.227 --> 24:07.924
TORRES:
NCIS.

24:11.145 --> 24:13.103
Something smells bad.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.628
They not only questioned
you-- they followed you.

24:15.671 --> 24:17.717
Actually, Angie,
we've been following you.

24:19.196 --> 24:21.111
Ever since you left
prison yesterday.

24:22.635 --> 24:24.158
TORRES:
Hey, McGee.

24:25.333 --> 24:26.682
We have a body.

24:26.726 --> 24:28.554
I'll call it in.

24:28.597 --> 24:30.512
J.T.?

24:30.556 --> 24:33.080
I don't know.

24:33.123 --> 24:34.647
Come here. Come here.

24:34.690 --> 24:35.909
It's gonna be all right.

24:37.214 --> 24:38.651
Gonna be all right.Okay.

24:38.694 --> 24:40.174
Hey, it's Torres.

24:40.217 --> 24:42.829
I'm reporting
a crime scene.

24:42.872 --> 24:45.832
MAN:
Hey, Gibbs, you in there?

24:45.875 --> 24:47.573
It's late.

24:47.616 --> 24:50.706
I got better places to be, man.

24:59.628 --> 25:00.847
Lew Nolte.

25:00.890 --> 25:02.805
Thanks for keeping me waiting.

25:02.849 --> 25:04.807
I see nothing's
changed here.

25:04.851 --> 25:07.244
Same drab walls.

25:07.288 --> 25:09.725
At least you could've
painted the place.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.379
Sit down, Lew.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.600
This is a waste of time.

25:14.643 --> 25:17.124
Yours and mine.

25:20.780 --> 25:23.565
You missing work or something?

25:25.349 --> 25:28.701
What have you done...

25:28.744 --> 25:31.530
since the admiral canned you?

25:32.618 --> 25:35.142
What do you want from me, Gibbs?

25:35.185 --> 25:37.840
The truth about that night.

25:37.884 --> 25:39.494
Mm.

25:42.366 --> 25:46.022
I suspected that you were
the inside man three years ago.

25:46.066 --> 25:48.982
I suspect it even more now.

25:50.374 --> 25:53.769
Why'd Angie Gray
call you this morning?

25:53.813 --> 25:55.031
What?

25:55.075 --> 25:57.381
We got her phone records.

25:57.425 --> 25:59.166
She called you.

25:59.209 --> 26:01.603
9:34 this morning.

26:02.909 --> 26:05.564
She left a message.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.478
I didn't get it.

26:09.219 --> 26:11.482
Listen, I've had enough
of NCIS in my face.

26:14.094 --> 26:17.750
I had nothing to do
with that robbery.

26:17.793 --> 26:20.274
You're the one
that made me into a suspect,

26:20.317 --> 26:21.928
and that's why I lost my job
with Admiral Padgett.

26:21.971 --> 26:25.496
And you know what? I've never
gotten a job as good ever since.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.760
I'm not feeling sorry for you.

26:27.803 --> 26:29.588
You got any other questions,
Gibbs?

26:29.631 --> 26:30.806
Oh, yeah.

26:30.850 --> 26:33.200
How did Angie Gray's accomplice

26:33.243 --> 26:35.724
know that there was
big money in that safe

26:35.768 --> 26:38.858
and that the maid and the cook

26:38.901 --> 26:40.468
were gonna be off that night?

26:40.511 --> 26:42.296
That again?

26:44.559 --> 26:47.606
I have no idea.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.873
What about that?

26:53.916 --> 26:56.397
I don't know.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.399
Who is it?

26:58.442 --> 27:00.923
Really?

27:00.967 --> 27:04.492
You got no idea...

27:04.535 --> 27:06.668
Lew?

27:06.712 --> 27:08.191
No idea...

27:08.235 --> 27:10.759
Gibbs.

27:16.591 --> 27:18.549
The mattress in the hotel

27:18.593 --> 27:20.639
was spongy and soft,

27:20.682 --> 27:22.771
so I took the blankets
and the pillow

27:22.815 --> 27:23.946
and threw them on the floor.

27:23.990 --> 27:25.295
Slept like a rock.

27:25.339 --> 27:26.819
But then, when I got

27:26.862 --> 27:27.907
to the airport this morning,

27:27.950 --> 27:29.735
I learned that my flight

27:29.778 --> 27:32.912
to Rapid City had been canceled
because of a snowstorm.

27:32.955 --> 27:34.174
Oh, that's awful.

27:34.217 --> 27:36.393
Well, there's
another flight tomorrow.

27:36.437 --> 27:37.786
So, what are you gonna do now?

27:37.830 --> 27:39.396
I have no choice.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.790
It's back to the floor
for the night.

27:41.834 --> 27:42.791
What do you got?

27:42.835 --> 27:44.010
Oh, hey, Duck.

27:44.053 --> 27:46.621
Ah, Jethro.How's the trip?

27:46.665 --> 27:47.622
There's been a flag
on the play.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.710
Well, not so much flags

27:48.754 --> 27:50.756
but the snow on the ground.

27:50.799 --> 27:52.714
I meticulously planned

27:52.758 --> 27:56.413
this trip with a private guide,
a fascinating man.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.372
He was telling me
that his grandfatherSorry, Duck.

27:58.415 --> 28:01.723
was one of the men who climbed
up the rock...Got our own problems here.

28:02.985 --> 28:04.857
You know how to end
a FaceTime call.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.293
What's a FaceTime?

28:06.336 --> 28:07.816
Right.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.078
You get an ID?

28:09.122 --> 28:10.819
Yeah. Fortunately, uh,

28:10.863 --> 28:13.343
fingerprints are one of the
last body parts to decompose.

28:13.387 --> 28:15.258
So, meet John Storvelle.

28:15.302 --> 28:16.651
C.O.D.?

28:16.695 --> 28:17.826
Five stab wounds.

28:17.870 --> 28:19.132
Four-inch skinner blade.

28:19.175 --> 28:20.873
He bled out.

28:20.916 --> 28:22.483
And these deep cuts
on his hands suggest

28:22.526 --> 28:23.527
that Storvelle fought back,

28:23.571 --> 28:25.051
trying to ward off
his attacker.

28:25.094 --> 28:26.748
Hey, Kasie. Yeah.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.707
I'm on my way down.

28:31.274 --> 28:34.321
Okay. I'm looking at money.

28:34.364 --> 28:37.759
Yep. A Netherlands Antillean
guilder, to be exact.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.543
I picked the pocket
of our corpse.

28:39.587 --> 28:40.980
Yeah. Where does
that mean he's been?

28:41.023 --> 28:42.808
The southeastern
Caribbean.

28:42.851 --> 28:45.027
It's the currency
of two island countries.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.029
CuraÃ§ao and Saint Martin.

28:47.073 --> 28:48.161
You narrowed it down.

28:48.204 --> 28:50.206
Thank you for your confidence.
And yes.

28:50.250 --> 28:53.993
Saint Martin. And I narrowed it
down a little more.

28:54.036 --> 28:57.474
It's a receipt. A little
weathered, but I could decipher

28:57.518 --> 29:00.695
it's from the bar
at a beach resort on the island.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.044
Interesting, huh?Yeah, very.

29:02.088 --> 29:03.959
So, uh, I'm running samples
of blood spatter

29:04.003 --> 29:05.874
that were found
at the crime scene.

29:05.918 --> 29:08.050
Maybe there's more
than just the vic's.

29:08.094 --> 29:10.400
Ooh. "Vic." Um,

29:10.444 --> 29:12.185
I had a prof at John Jay
who hated

29:12.228 --> 29:14.187
that diminutive for "victim."

29:14.230 --> 29:16.624
Does it bother
you, Gibbs?

29:16.667 --> 29:18.582
No. Thank you.

29:18.626 --> 29:20.193
Hey, you look
like you got something.

29:20.236 --> 29:23.196
I do. Uh, when Jimmy gave me
the name John Storvelle,

29:23.239 --> 29:24.980
I checked him out,
and he had a prior arrest.

29:25.024 --> 29:27.287
Robbery?In West Virginia.

29:27.330 --> 29:30.725
His full name is
John Thomas Storvelle.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.640
And McGee said that the cellmate

29:32.683 --> 29:35.077
referred to Angie Gray's
boyfriend as J.T.

29:35.121 --> 29:37.471
Get everything
you can on him, pronto.

29:37.514 --> 29:39.516
Mm-hmm.You know, Grammy Hines would say

29:39.560 --> 29:41.692
he doesn't let the grass
grow under his feet.

29:41.736 --> 29:43.869
Something like that.

29:44.826 --> 29:47.524
Come in.

29:47.568 --> 29:50.484
Hey, Tim.Hey.

29:50.527 --> 29:52.616
Uh, thanks, Tim.
I'll take it from here.

29:53.704 --> 29:56.185
Um...

29:56.229 --> 29:59.710
Hiya, Angie.

29:59.754 --> 30:01.495
I know I have
some 'splainin' to do.

30:01.538 --> 30:03.497
Yeah. I'd say.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.107
Yesterday on the street.

30:05.151 --> 30:06.674
You were messing with me.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.981
Yeah, I made a point
of meeting you.

30:09.024 --> 30:10.156
Why?

30:10.199 --> 30:12.593
Have a seat.

30:12.636 --> 30:14.116
Please.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.510
Why?

30:16.553 --> 30:17.859
Um...

30:17.903 --> 30:20.601
I wanted to talk to you
before I judged you.

30:22.603 --> 30:24.561
It's my job, Angie.
I'm an agent,

30:24.605 --> 30:27.477
and NCIS is still
investigating the robbery.

30:27.521 --> 30:29.131
I served my time.

30:29.175 --> 30:30.611
I'm on parole.

30:30.654 --> 30:33.309
I thought all of this
was behind me. Isn't it?

30:35.442 --> 30:36.530
Excuse me.

30:43.145 --> 30:46.409
We know that
you're looking for J.T.

30:46.453 --> 30:47.410
And I understand that.

30:47.454 --> 30:50.544
You have
strong feelings for him.

30:50.587 --> 30:52.328
So much so that you turned down

30:52.372 --> 30:54.853
the prosecutor's deal
to protect him.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.855
Not a lot of people
would do that.

30:56.898 --> 30:59.205
I really do get it.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.728
No one else does.

31:00.771 --> 31:02.643
Not even Lanny.

31:02.686 --> 31:04.427
Your cellmate.

31:04.471 --> 31:05.994
She thinks I'm crazy.

31:06.038 --> 31:07.822
Listen, Angie,

31:07.866 --> 31:09.606
we're concerned.

31:09.650 --> 31:13.436
NCIS wasn't the only one
following you.

31:13.480 --> 31:16.091
So was a private
investigator.

31:16.135 --> 31:18.615
He broke into
your hotel room yesterday.

31:18.659 --> 31:20.879
What?He was

31:20.922 --> 31:23.490
in your hotel room
when you got back from our talk.

31:24.534 --> 31:25.753
No.

31:25.796 --> 31:27.842
We saw him, Angie.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.366
I don't know what's going on.

31:30.410 --> 31:33.195
I just want to find J.T.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.508
Oh, my God.

31:42.857 --> 31:44.598
He's dead.

31:44.641 --> 31:47.209
I'm sorry.

31:47.253 --> 31:49.429
John Storvelle...

31:49.472 --> 31:53.172
was your boyfriend
and your accomplice.

31:55.043 --> 31:58.351
I never knew his last name.

31:58.394 --> 32:00.179
Angie, why did you

32:00.222 --> 32:03.269
call Lew Nolte yesterday?

32:03.312 --> 32:04.835
Because...

32:04.879 --> 32:07.664
I was desperate to find J.T.

32:09.318 --> 32:13.235
I didn't know Nolte.
I just remembered that NCIS...

32:13.279 --> 32:16.151
thought he might be
involved, and...

32:16.195 --> 32:17.718
I thought if he was,

32:17.761 --> 32:20.416
he might know where to find him.

32:21.461 --> 32:23.506
Hey.

32:27.032 --> 32:29.860
I'm really sorry.

32:32.472 --> 32:34.648
BISHOP:
I followed Kasie's
Saint Martin lead,

32:34.691 --> 32:36.606
and the receipt
in J.T.'s pocket was from

32:36.650 --> 32:38.521
this bar.McGEE:
The boyfriend ran off

32:38.565 --> 32:40.741
with the money
to a tropical island.

32:40.784 --> 32:42.743
He had no intention
of sharing it with Angie.

32:42.786 --> 32:44.788
He rented a cottage
on the white-sand beach,

32:44.832 --> 32:46.616
and he partied pretty hard.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.314
Till the money ran out.

32:48.357 --> 32:49.532
I talked to Doggie,

32:49.576 --> 32:52.274
the bartender at his hang,
and he said

32:52.318 --> 32:55.190
everyone loved J.T. until he
stopped picking up the tab.

32:55.234 --> 32:56.757
So then he started
taking odd jobs--

32:56.800 --> 32:58.715
beachboy, cabdriver,
even busboy--

32:58.759 --> 33:00.065
and then he gave up.

33:00.108 --> 33:02.589
Did the Doggie say when
he left the island?

33:02.632 --> 33:05.070
The Doggie guessed
about three months ago.

33:05.113 --> 33:06.680
J.T. didn't say goodbye
to anyone.

33:06.723 --> 33:08.551
Plus, I ran his passport.

33:08.595 --> 33:11.293
He took a flight from Princess
Juliana International Airport

33:11.337 --> 33:13.556
to Dulles on August 17.

33:13.600 --> 33:14.731
Hmm.

33:14.775 --> 33:16.298
That's about four months ago.

33:16.342 --> 33:19.910
Well, now that we know
who Angie's accomplice is,

33:19.954 --> 33:22.174
let's do what we couldn't
do three years ago--

33:22.217 --> 33:23.784
look for a connection
between J.T.

33:23.827 --> 33:26.656
and our original suspect,
the admiral's assistant.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.006
Let's.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.833
VANCE:
You found the accomplice

33:29.877 --> 33:31.226
and he's dead?

33:31.270 --> 33:32.836
Stabbed to death.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.796
Well, I was hoping
to come back to good news.

33:35.839 --> 33:37.754
You got anything?

33:37.798 --> 33:39.669
Maybe.

33:39.713 --> 33:41.323
What does that mean?

33:41.367 --> 33:44.500
Angie Gray was being tailed
by a private investigator.

33:44.544 --> 33:46.328
Phil Iverson.

33:46.372 --> 33:48.243
Phil Iverson. Who hired him?

33:48.287 --> 33:49.679
And why?

33:49.723 --> 33:51.246
McGee's got a trace

33:51.290 --> 33:52.769
on his cell's GPS.

33:52.813 --> 33:54.815
We'll get it.

33:54.858 --> 33:56.730
Gibbs.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.079
Look...

33:58.123 --> 34:00.081
I know you've, uh,

34:00.125 --> 34:03.693
always had a special interest
in this one, but, uh...

34:03.737 --> 34:05.652
you tried to help
this girl three years ago,

34:05.695 --> 34:06.740
and she wouldn't listen.

34:06.783 --> 34:09.264
Don't expect any help
from her now.

34:09.308 --> 34:11.223
Angie's dad was a good guy.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.529
She was a kid
when he was killed.

34:13.573 --> 34:15.096
She took it hard.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.881
I got to do what I can for her.

34:19.709 --> 34:21.842
WOMAN'S VOICE:
Turn left.

34:23.278 --> 34:25.802
You have arrived
at your destination.

34:48.303 --> 34:51.219
How the hell
is the admiral involved?

35:02.622 --> 35:04.754
All right, I'll see you
when you get back.

35:04.798 --> 35:06.147
That was Nick.

35:06.191 --> 35:08.410
They tailed Iverson
to Admiral Padgett's house.

35:08.454 --> 35:09.411
You're kidding.

35:09.455 --> 35:10.804
No.

35:13.328 --> 35:14.721
And I wonder if they're
colluding in some kind of

35:14.764 --> 35:16.723
Murder on the Orient Express.

35:16.766 --> 35:18.377
Huh?

35:18.420 --> 35:19.726
You never heard of it?

35:19.769 --> 35:20.944
Uh, yeah,
it's a movie.

35:20.988 --> 35:22.076
Well, it was a book first.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.731
Classic Agatha Christie
murder mystery.

35:24.774 --> 35:26.689
It's about a body
in a train compartment.

35:26.733 --> 35:29.170
Right? There's a slew
of suspects on board.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.606
Turns out they were
all in on the murder,

35:30.650 --> 35:32.217
but for different reasons.

35:32.260 --> 35:35.220
Hmm. Sounds complicated.

35:35.263 --> 35:36.438
Mm. Could be.

35:36.482 --> 35:37.874
For all different reasons,

35:37.918 --> 35:41.791
they each wanted J.T. dead.

35:55.501 --> 35:58.765
Not likely you were just
in the neighborhood, Gibbs.

35:58.808 --> 36:00.288
Working the
case, Admiral.

36:00.332 --> 36:02.029
Following a suspect.

36:02.072 --> 36:04.727
The private investigator
that just left.

36:04.771 --> 36:06.860
I'm not sure where to start.

36:06.903 --> 36:08.862
Well, let me help you.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.864
You hired Phil Iverson
to tail Angie Gray,

36:10.907 --> 36:14.346
hoping that she would lead
you to her accomplice.

36:14.389 --> 36:16.478
That revenge?

36:16.522 --> 36:18.480
I didn't care
what happened to that punk.

36:18.524 --> 36:20.787
Yeah. I believe that.

36:20.830 --> 36:23.703
Heard on the news
you found him yesterday.

36:23.746 --> 36:24.878
Stabbed to death.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.488
Three months ago.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.969
Hmm.Even if your P.I.
did kill him,

36:29.012 --> 36:31.145
which I doubt,

36:31.189 --> 36:33.713
why is he still on the job?

36:33.756 --> 36:36.368
You don't need the
money, Admiral.

36:36.411 --> 36:38.848
No matter how much
was in your safe,

36:38.892 --> 36:41.199
it wouldn't mean anything
to you and your wife.

36:41.242 --> 36:42.852
It would be like me
losing 20 bucks.

36:42.896 --> 36:44.898
What are you saying?

36:44.941 --> 36:47.205
That there was something
else in that safe

36:47.248 --> 36:50.947
that you and your
P.I. are looking for.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.908
What?

37:14.667 --> 37:16.408
Uh, excuse me.

37:16.451 --> 37:18.018
Lanny?

37:18.061 --> 37:19.933
Yeah.

37:19.976 --> 37:22.414
NCIS Special Agent Sloane.

37:22.457 --> 37:24.807
Yeah. Angie mentioned
talking to you.

37:24.851 --> 37:26.113
She here?

37:26.156 --> 37:28.463
Not answering.Mm.

37:28.507 --> 37:30.900
She said you were really
up front with her about J.T.

37:30.944 --> 37:33.294
Said you understood
her better than I do.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.818
That girl's in a bad place.

37:35.862 --> 37:37.080
That's why I'm here.

37:37.124 --> 37:39.126
After she left me,
I learned the truth:

37:39.169 --> 37:42.085
J.T. ditched her,
took the money and ran.That bastard.

37:42.129 --> 37:44.000
That's what
I thought.Hey.

37:45.611 --> 37:46.829
What are you doing here?

37:46.873 --> 37:49.092
Listen, Angie, uh...

37:49.136 --> 37:51.530
we need to talk.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.490
BISHOP:
It's crazy. Nolte's
got bank accounts

37:55.534 --> 37:58.101
and investments
all over the place.McGEE: Despite the fact

37:58.145 --> 38:00.321
that he hasn't had a steady
job since he was canned

38:00.365 --> 38:01.801
by the admiral.Everything I found

38:01.844 --> 38:04.151
was funded since the
first of this year,

38:04.194 --> 38:05.761
after we stopped tagging him.

38:05.805 --> 38:08.416
He waited us out and
kept under the radar.

38:08.460 --> 38:11.245
Low-rent apartment.
Ten-year-old wheels.

38:11.289 --> 38:14.335
Unlike J.T., he's saving
his share of the stolen money.

38:20.820 --> 38:23.997
All right, there's our
connection-- John Storvelle

38:24.040 --> 38:26.782
and Lew Nolte were both billeted
at Norfolk five years ago.

38:26.826 --> 38:29.045
Not in the same unit,
but they lived

38:29.089 --> 38:31.657
in the same barrack,
Stayton Hall.They knew each other.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.006
You got to think.

38:33.049 --> 38:35.443
And there is no such thing
as coincidences.

38:35.487 --> 38:37.532
What rule was that?

38:39.578 --> 38:40.840
Right this way.

39:14.395 --> 39:16.092
What do you want?

39:16.136 --> 39:17.964
You know who I am?

39:18.007 --> 39:21.054
Yeah, sure. You were on the news
a lot, like, three years ago.

39:21.097 --> 39:22.490
Why are you here?

39:24.057 --> 39:26.886
Because I think NCIS was right.

39:26.929 --> 39:29.845
I think you set up J.T.
to rob that house.

39:29.889 --> 39:31.281
Yeah, well, they were wrong.

39:31.325 --> 39:33.414
And so are you.
Now, get out of here.

39:33.458 --> 39:34.894
It had to be you.

39:34.937 --> 39:36.678
I've had three years
to think about it.

39:36.722 --> 39:38.724
You worked at the
admiral's house.

39:38.767 --> 39:40.900
You knew that the servants
were off that night.

39:40.943 --> 39:42.467
You set...I said get out of here!

39:43.816 --> 39:46.340
You killed J.T., didn't you?

39:46.384 --> 39:47.472
You bitch.

39:47.515 --> 39:48.777
Am I right?

39:48.821 --> 39:51.737
No, you're crazy.

39:51.780 --> 39:54.609
Tell me what happened
at the cabin.

39:54.653 --> 39:56.219
Why the hell do you give
a damn about that loser?

39:56.263 --> 39:57.525
J.T. was a bad dude

39:57.569 --> 39:59.788
who let you take
the rap for him.

40:01.660 --> 40:03.879
Oh, you really
don't get it, do you?

40:03.923 --> 40:06.186
When you got arrested,
he didn't give a damn.

40:06.229 --> 40:08.754
All he cared about was
what was in the safe

40:08.797 --> 40:10.495
and how much money
we were splitting.

40:10.538 --> 40:12.497
No. He loved me.

40:12.540 --> 40:14.542
Yeah, right.
J.T. was a player.

40:14.586 --> 40:17.066
He played you--
and all the other young ladies.

40:17.110 --> 40:18.111
You're lying.

40:18.154 --> 40:19.417
No.

40:19.460 --> 40:21.462
And let me tell you
something else.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.377
He was stupid.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.031
Aside from
all that money

40:25.074 --> 40:27.773
that was in the safe, there were
some incriminating photos

40:27.816 --> 40:29.252
of the old admiral.

40:29.296 --> 40:30.906
Real porno stuff.

40:30.950 --> 40:32.908
So vile, if it ever
got out in public,

40:32.952 --> 40:36.129
it would ruin his marriage
and his Navy career.

40:36.172 --> 40:38.827
But dumb J.T. didn't see
the value in them.

40:38.871 --> 40:40.699
But I did.

40:40.742 --> 40:43.005
You blackmailed the admiral.

40:43.049 --> 40:45.921
I still am, sweetheart.

40:45.965 --> 40:48.663
Now I know what happened
in the cabin.

40:48.707 --> 40:50.883
J.T. went through
his share of the money,

40:50.926 --> 40:53.929
and he came back
to get cut in on the blackmail.

40:53.973 --> 40:55.235
Yeah, and I told him
to shove it.

40:55.278 --> 40:57.150
And you killed him.

40:57.193 --> 40:59.152
Yeah.

41:00.980 --> 41:03.199
Put the bat down!

41:07.203 --> 41:09.815
We recorded all of it, Lew.

41:19.085 --> 41:20.826
Thank you, Chris.Mm-hmm.

41:22.001 --> 41:23.655
Hmm.

41:23.698 --> 41:26.005
This is a tough decision.

41:26.048 --> 41:27.354
What?

41:27.397 --> 41:30.009
From accounting.
I got my choice.

41:30.052 --> 41:33.882
A replacement sweater
or my money back.

41:33.926 --> 41:36.232
Money back.Money back.

41:38.321 --> 41:40.062
SLOANE:
Thanks for your help, Angie.

41:40.106 --> 41:42.848
I really appreciate your
encouragement, Agent Sloane.

41:42.891 --> 41:46.591
Hey, if you ever get stuck,
making a choice or whatever,

41:46.634 --> 41:48.288
you give me a call.

41:48.331 --> 41:50.072
We'll talk, okay?

41:52.553 --> 41:54.468
Okay.Bye.

41:57.079 --> 42:00.082
I should have listened
to you, Agent Gibbs.

42:03.085 --> 42:06.001
I wasted three years of my life.

42:06.045 --> 42:08.134
Clean slate, Angie.

42:08.177 --> 42:10.179
Whole new life ahead.

42:11.224 --> 42:13.226
Make your father proud.
