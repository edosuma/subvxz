WEBVTT

00:06.548 --> 00:09.927
[tense theme music]

00:18.310 --> 00:21.313
[wind whistling]

00:32.032 --> 00:33.742
[creaking]

01:01.019 --> 01:02.354
Hmm.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.448
Ah.

01:20.622 --> 01:21.790
Hmm.

01:23.667 --> 01:24.876
[sniffs]

01:24.960 --> 01:26.461
Fresh oil.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.137
Anybody home?

01:41.435 --> 01:42.436
[hollow clang]

01:42.519 --> 01:43.854
Warm.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.148
That's weird.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.817
[rustling]

01:51.612 --> 01:53.071
I can hear you.

01:54.406 --> 01:55.699
I'm armed,

01:55.782 --> 01:57.743
and a lot less happy than you are...

01:58.660 --> 02:01.246
so you want to stay well out of my way.

02:03.332 --> 02:05.626
Whoa! Oh!

02:07.502 --> 02:10.839
Ha! Reflexes like a cat.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.883
- [rumbling]
- Oh!

02:12.966 --> 02:15.177
[screams]

02:15.260 --> 02:16.678
Unh!

02:19.306 --> 02:20.766
Oh.

02:20.849 --> 02:24.227
[pained grunts]

02:30.859 --> 02:33.945
[electricity hums]

02:50.462 --> 02:51.463
[metallic clink]

02:51.546 --> 02:54.508
Either someone left a statue
of a Speaker down here, or...

02:54.591 --> 02:57.427
[heavy footfalls]

03:09.272 --> 03:10.399
Cyclops!

03:17.614 --> 03:19.533
Stone-eye cyclops.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.827
Right out of the family bestiary.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.037
God shits in my dinner once again.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.213
Oopf!

03:34.673 --> 03:35.674
[screams]

03:36.717 --> 03:38.343
[grunting]

03:50.230 --> 03:53.191
Come on. Come on!

03:53.275 --> 03:54.860
You're dead!

03:54.943 --> 03:56.820
Stop and notice you're dead.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.990
[grunts]

04:00.073 --> 04:02.033
Ugh! Bastard.

04:11.543 --> 04:12.753
[grunts]

04:36.234 --> 04:37.235
[soft gasp]

04:38.570 --> 04:39.863
[groans]

04:39.946 --> 04:40.947
Ew.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.492
[vomiting]

04:43.575 --> 04:44.701
Granddaughter, then.

04:45.827 --> 04:49.706
Ah. I wish Speakers wouldn't do that.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.625
What?

04:51.708 --> 04:54.461
Dress the girls like boys.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.130
It's safer when we travel.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.673
What happened?

04:58.757 --> 05:00.509
You walked into a cyclops.

05:00.592 --> 05:03.887
Turns you to stone with its eyeball
and feeds on your terror

05:03.970 --> 05:06.223
while you're trapped in your own body.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.267
Did... did you climb on me?

05:09.351 --> 05:10.393
Mm, a bit.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.645
That was rude.

05:11.728 --> 05:12.771
Excuse me?

05:12.854 --> 05:14.022
Who are you, anyway?

05:15.023 --> 05:16.525
I met your grandfather.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.419
He wouldn't leave the city
until he had your body.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.696
I came down to recover your remains
so the Speakers would go to safety.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.491
But the Sleeping Warrior
is still down here.

05:24.574 --> 05:27.077
There is no Sleeping Warrior,

05:27.160 --> 05:30.914
just a cyclops waiting for people
stupid enough to go looking.

05:30.997 --> 05:34.584
It's a trap for gullible Speakers.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.586
You're not popular around here.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.964
The old wisdom says the tomb is guarded...

05:39.047 --> 05:42.259
Yeah, yeah. Come on. Time to go home.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.760
Your people think you're dead.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.221
The least you can do
is set that old man's mind to rest.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.265
He thinks I'm dead?

05:48.348 --> 05:49.808
He wasn't much wrong.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.227
Killing a cyclops is the only way
to restore a victim.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.937
Didn't think I'd manage it.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.522
Who are you?

05:56.982 --> 05:58.942
Trevor Belmont.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.695
But the Belmonts fight monsters.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.363
I'm out of practice.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.115
Let's show you to your grandfather,

06:05.198 --> 06:07.867
and then you can come down here
and get killed again. Deal?

06:08.785 --> 06:10.161
Very well.

06:10.245 --> 06:11.871
I'm Sypha Belnades.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.123
[Trevor] I don't care.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.668
[crackling]

06:18.086 --> 06:19.713
[gasps]

06:35.729 --> 06:36.813
Oh!

06:39.941 --> 06:42.277
[sighs] Thank you.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.196
Mm. You're welcome.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.867
I failed to find the Sleeper. I'm sorry!

06:48.950 --> 06:50.076
Oh, hush.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.162
Hush now, my angel.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.123
I very much doubt
there's anyone down there.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.709
It's probably a booby-trapped legend.

06:57.792 --> 07:01.504
There's someone wriggling with pleasure
in his coffin right now

07:01.588 --> 07:03.131
thinking of people like your girl

07:03.214 --> 07:05.925
walking into the cyclops
he left down there.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.387
Or perhaps there is something
down there so important

07:09.471 --> 07:11.806
that it must be guarded by monsters.

07:11.890 --> 07:15.977
Your Messiah isn't down there.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.063
And what makes you so sure?

07:18.647 --> 07:21.816
You Speakers carry information
down through the generations.

07:22.651 --> 07:26.279
We Belmonts pass things down as well.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.032
Do you remember what we saw down there?

07:31.117 --> 07:33.328
Metal veins pumping hot liquid?

07:33.411 --> 07:36.039
Torches that light by themselves

07:36.122 --> 07:40.126
that exactly fit descriptions
written by my great-grandfather.

07:41.127 --> 07:45.215
Descriptions of the inside
of Dracula's castle.

07:46.049 --> 07:49.135
I don't know what's down there,
but it's not a messiah.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.097
I'll leave you all to it.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.765
No, no... nonsense.

07:53.848 --> 07:57.769
Please, stay with us
for as long as you like.

07:57.852 --> 08:01.064
I cannot begin to repay what I owe you.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.191
You're leaving tonight, remember?

08:04.025 --> 08:07.153
Well, uh, yes. Until then.

08:07.237 --> 08:10.073
Right. I'll come back later.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.867
See if you can find some beer.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.580
I could pee in a bucket
and tell him it's beer.

08:17.664 --> 08:21.042
Sypha, he saved your life!

08:21.126 --> 08:22.502
He's rude.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.427
- [blade snicks]
- [gasps]

08:30.510 --> 08:34.347
Uh, careful.
My knife hand's not too steady.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.683
I could slip and take your eye out.

08:36.766 --> 08:37.600
[Trevor groans]

08:37.684 --> 08:42.230
The Bishop of Gresit requests
your kind attendance at the church.

08:45.316 --> 08:49.362
I don't think I'm allowed into churches.

08:49.988 --> 08:53.408
The bishop says
he'll make an exception in your case.

08:53.491 --> 08:56.911
[chuckles] No. Seriously.

08:56.995 --> 09:00.331
I realize you're trying
to menacingly abduct me,

09:00.415 --> 09:03.251
but I'm excommunicated.

09:03.334 --> 09:09.174
The bishop said to tell you that the terms
of even major excommunication

09:09.257 --> 09:13.595
mean that you are obliged to appear
when summoned by the Church.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.348
Well, shit.

09:18.433 --> 09:23.980
Look, if I enter the church
and catch fire or something,

09:24.064 --> 09:25.523
it's your fault.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.947
[caws]

09:36.284 --> 09:38.953
[grunts, groans]

10:09.734 --> 10:11.820
I am the Bishop of Gresit.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.448
You're not from around here.

10:16.282 --> 10:20.036
No. I'm originally from Targoviste.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.205
I was an aide to the archbishop.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.749
How did you divine that?

10:24.833 --> 10:26.709
Well, you're not running
away screaming

10:26.793 --> 10:28.837
like the rest of the locals,
for one thing.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.547
[scoffs] From you?

10:30.630 --> 10:35.385
From the baby-eating freaks of nature
who apparently raid Gresit every night.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.595
I'm here to save Gresit.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.098
[Trevor chuckles]
And how do you intend to do that?

10:40.181 --> 10:43.768
I brought you here
to answer some questions,

10:43.852 --> 10:45.979
not ask them.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.647
Well, tough shit!

10:47.730 --> 10:52.694
How exactly do you intend to help
these people by killing Speakers?

10:52.777 --> 10:55.864
The Speakers brought
these troubles upon themselves.

10:55.947 --> 10:58.950
One cannot live without God...

10:59.576 --> 11:02.078
quite literally, in these days.

11:02.162 --> 11:07.375
You think the night hordes came
because people weren't religious enough?

11:07.458 --> 11:09.169
And you were at Targoviste?

11:10.086 --> 11:14.340
The Archbishop had certain... interests

11:14.424 --> 11:17.510
that I believe compromised his ability

11:17.594 --> 11:20.847
to protect the city and the country.

11:20.930 --> 11:24.726
I was sent away long before Dracula
came to Targoviste.

11:24.809 --> 11:29.772
We disagreed on matters
of clerical discipline.

11:29.856 --> 11:33.026
But you were there for the burning
of Dracula's wife. I heard all about that.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.737
Oh, yes. I arranged it, in fact.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.906
The woman was a witch.

11:37.989 --> 11:42.118
And there can be no doubt now
that she consorted with the devil.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.913
She even married him.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.289
I see.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.416
And I'm here to be disciplined?

11:48.499 --> 11:49.751
Not as such.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.669
I have a gift for you.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.923
Your life, Belmont.

11:55.006 --> 11:57.342
Take it and go.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.178
Tonight, the Speakers
will be dealt with,

12:00.261 --> 12:02.972
and then Gresit will be secure.

12:03.056 --> 12:09.103
I refuse, however, to toil so hard
for the soul of this city

12:09.187 --> 12:13.858
with an excommunicant heretic
within its walls.

12:13.942 --> 12:17.820
You could undo everything
by your very presence.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.073
My God.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.742
You really believe it, don't you?

12:22.825 --> 12:28.623
You will leave Gresit by sundown,
or you will not see the morning.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.416
Do I make myself clear?

12:30.917 --> 12:34.587
Despite the crimes
you've committed against my aides,

12:34.671 --> 12:39.550
despite the crimes
your family has committed against God,

12:39.634 --> 12:44.389
you will walk safely until sundown.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.933
My family committed no crime.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.977
You people simply decided we were wrong

12:49.060 --> 12:51.437
to defend this land
against the supernatural. And now...

12:51.521 --> 12:57.485
You Belmonts have never understood
the power of the Word of God!

12:57.568 --> 13:01.614
The people of this city are mine
and our Lord's now,

13:01.698 --> 13:05.493
and they'll do as I ask in His name.

13:05.576 --> 13:10.832
By morning, no Speaker
will defile these streets,

13:10.915 --> 13:14.043
and you will either be gone or be dead.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.088
Do you understand?

13:18.172 --> 13:19.841
Yes.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.594
Do this thing for me,

13:23.678 --> 13:26.264
and the matter
of your excision from the church

13:26.347 --> 13:28.433
will be something we can discuss.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.813
No offense, but you are just a bishop.

13:33.896 --> 13:37.900
Excommunication came
from a little higher up the ladder.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.488
Targoviste is gone.

13:42.572 --> 13:46.409
The other great cities are lost or losing.

13:46.492 --> 13:50.705
Gresit will be
the last major city in Wallachia.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.499
To all intents and purposes,

13:53.583 --> 13:57.545
I will be the church.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.926
Trevor! Join us.

14:04.927 --> 14:08.222
Sure. By the way,
you're all going to die.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.807
What?

14:09.891 --> 14:12.435
The current bishop of this place is...

14:12.518 --> 14:16.647
Well, he's beyond insane.

14:17.440 --> 14:21.527
Over the top and into new lands
of just snake-fuckingly crazy,

14:21.611 --> 14:23.988
and convinced that the salvation of Gresit

14:24.072 --> 14:28.034
lays in you people
being torn to pieces by a mob.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.328
[soft grunt] When?

14:30.411 --> 14:32.663
Before the sun goes down.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.415
By his logic, you have to die

14:34.499 --> 14:37.210
before the night creatures
conduct their next raid.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.962
What happens if we stay and survive?

14:40.046 --> 14:41.857
Well, then the night creatures
will come anyway,

14:41.881 --> 14:44.842
and the church will blame you,
and it'll start all over again.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.512
This feels wrong.

14:47.595 --> 14:51.724
To be driven out for a lie
that will doom these people,

14:51.808 --> 14:54.227
it is not a Speaker thing.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.229
We had an agreement.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.981
I don't think
it's a Belmont thing, either.

14:59.065 --> 15:02.777
I don't care.
You need to leave, and leave now.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.904
I don't think we can leave these people,

15:04.987 --> 15:06.656
not in their time of need!

15:06.739 --> 15:10.034
These people believe
you're causing their time of need!

15:10.118 --> 15:13.037
Only because they are being
misled by the Church.

15:14.247 --> 15:17.667
Does one run away
when someone tells lies about them?

15:17.750 --> 15:20.795
What have the Church said
about the Belmonts?

15:20.878 --> 15:24.632
That you have been corrupted
by dealings with the supernatural,

15:24.715 --> 15:27.009
that you mock God,

15:27.093 --> 15:29.679
that you are threat to the common good,

15:29.762 --> 15:32.807
and that evil follows wherever you go.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.226
And what did you do in the face of that?

15:36.227 --> 15:37.562
I didn't run away.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.565
Really. So, what are you running to?

15:40.648 --> 15:43.067
Did you have a destination in mind?

15:43.151 --> 15:44.777
Are you calling me a coward?

15:44.861 --> 15:49.365
No. I am calling you
defeated, Trevor Belmont.

15:49.449 --> 15:53.244
You fought your battle
and you decided you lost.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.745
We didn't have a choice.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.415
Perhaps. But we do.

15:57.498 --> 16:01.544
We carry with us the accumulated wisdom
of this great country.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.464
We will use that to fight our battle.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.673
You'll lose.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.467
We might well lose.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.344
But, if nothing else,
we might show someone that,

16:10.428 --> 16:12.763
although battles are won and lost,

16:12.847 --> 16:15.224
there is a larger war at stake.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.351
With Dracula's armies?

16:17.435 --> 16:18.603
No.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.731
A war for the soul of our people.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.275
Because if we truly are the sort of people

16:24.358 --> 16:28.613
who will kill one another at the behest
of a madman's fantasies,

16:28.696 --> 16:31.199
Then perhaps it is right and proper

16:31.282 --> 16:35.203
that things from Hell
should rise up to wipe us out.

16:35.286 --> 16:37.830
It's time for those of us
who fight that war

16:37.914 --> 16:41.209
to stand up and be responsible,
Trevor Belmont.

16:41.292 --> 16:43.586
You should leave now.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.505
[sighs]

16:47.465 --> 16:48.674
No.

16:49.884 --> 16:54.222
You're leaving right now.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.606
[chittering]

17:07.193 --> 17:08.486
[bestial squall]

17:12.782 --> 17:14.700
[angry cries]

17:19.830 --> 17:22.750
[angry chanting]

17:30.174 --> 17:34.095
[angry voices continuing]

17:49.944 --> 17:53.781
[axe blows land]

18:02.790 --> 18:04.625
[exertion grunt]

18:12.008 --> 18:13.801
Where are the Speakers?

18:14.927 --> 18:16.971
I've put them somewhere safe.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.473
I swear it just moved.

18:19.557 --> 18:23.185
You defend evil. Give them to us!

18:23.269 --> 18:25.813
[angry voices]

18:26.897 --> 18:28.566
Shut up.

18:28.649 --> 18:31.152
[head priest scoffs]
What?

18:31.235 --> 18:32.403
[Trevor]
Shut up.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.531
You're not getting the Speakers.

18:35.615 --> 18:39.452
You're getting no blood today, so shut up.

18:39.535 --> 18:40.369
Unh!

18:40.453 --> 18:44.373
You will give us the Speakers
so that we can save this city.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.542
This city's lost.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.378
It was lost when you
and the rest of your scum moved in.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.464
- Ow.
- And what?

18:52.465 --> 18:54.717
You are here to fight us?

18:54.800 --> 18:58.346
You're here to convince the people
that nomad black magicians

18:58.429 --> 18:59.847
are good for Gresit,

18:59.930 --> 19:02.058
and it is the presence of men of God

19:02.141 --> 19:03.934
that brought the night hordes upon us?

19:04.018 --> 19:07.188
- You know...
- Silence! Look at you.

19:07.271 --> 19:11.233
You're a wreck. You stink.
You can barely keep your eyes open.

19:11.317 --> 19:15.071
What do you expect to achieve against us?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.324
Absolutely nothing.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.826
So you're going to die for nothing?

19:20.910 --> 19:23.079
For people you don't know?

19:23.162 --> 19:25.373
I don't know any of you,

19:25.456 --> 19:27.375
but that doesn't matter, does it?

19:28.209 --> 19:29.627
My family,

19:29.710 --> 19:32.421
the family you demonized
and excommunicated,

19:32.505 --> 19:36.217
has fought and died
through generations for this country.

19:37.426 --> 19:42.390
We do this thing
for Wallachia and her people.

19:42.473 --> 19:46.310
We don't have to know you all.
We do it anyway.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.730
And it's not the dying that frightens us.

19:51.273 --> 19:54.193
It's never having stood up
and fought for you.

19:55.069 --> 19:59.949
I am Trevor Belmont
of the House of Belmont,

20:00.449 --> 20:04.412
and dying has never frightened me.

20:05.830 --> 20:06.831
Good.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.840
[groaning]

20:15.923 --> 20:17.049
[grunt]

20:22.972 --> 20:24.306
[sharp gasp]

20:24.390 --> 20:26.976
[labored breath]

20:27.059 --> 20:28.853
[angry voices rise]

20:40.239 --> 20:41.824
[screaming]

21:01.635 --> 21:03.971
[groans]

21:09.518 --> 21:11.729
[panting]

21:11.812 --> 21:12.938
[arrows whooshing]

21:13.022 --> 21:14.023
Aah!

21:19.820 --> 21:20.821
[soft gasp]

21:38.714 --> 21:40.466
[groans]

21:46.972 --> 21:49.350
[both archers scream]

21:49.433 --> 21:51.685
[bodies thud]

21:51.769 --> 21:54.772
[pants, sighs]

21:56.941 --> 21:58.484
[mob yelling in distance]

21:58.567 --> 21:59.568
Ooh...

21:59.652 --> 22:00.653
[man] There he is!

22:02.404 --> 22:05.658
[Trevor panting]

22:09.161 --> 22:13.999
[bestial squall]
