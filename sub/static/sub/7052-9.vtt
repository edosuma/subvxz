00:01.117 --> 00:02.948
Previously on Fringe:

00:03.119 --> 00:04.950
They call these events the Pattern.

00:05.121 --> 00:08.055
As if someone is experimenting,
the whole world is their lab.

00:08.458 --> 00:10.187
Anybody you need, you can have.

00:10.360 --> 00:11.793
His name's Walter Bishop.

00:12.262 --> 00:15.857
- You're saying I can talk to John?
- You could access his memories.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.928
You fall in love with your partner
who betrays you, dies in your arms.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.003
- I saw him last night.
- Hello, Liv.

00:22.172 --> 00:24.265
I grabbed my gun, but he was gone.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.932
When you were in the tank
part of his consciousness...

00:27.110 --> 00:29.101
...crossed over into yours.

00:32.448 --> 00:34.144
- Hey. Sorry.
- I've been calling.

00:34.317 --> 00:36.478
The highway was a parking lot.
Did they start?

00:36.653 --> 00:39.019
Yeah, Charlotte's been tap dancing
for 20 minutes.

00:39.189 --> 00:41.817
- Wait, your tie.
- Oh. Thank you.

00:41.991 --> 00:44.118
- Don't forget this. And breathe.
- Thanks.

00:44.294 --> 00:47.695
And ExtenzaLife's market
has remained remarkably stable.

00:47.864 --> 00:52.801
Especially given Wall Street's
recent financial difficulties.

00:52.969 --> 00:55.904
But let me turn things over to the man
you've come to hear.

00:56.106 --> 00:57.198
- Hello.
- Mark.

00:57.373 --> 01:00.399
Sorry. I'm late.
Thank you for your patience.

01:00.610 --> 01:03.875
- It's quickly fading.
- Right. So let's get started.

01:04.047 --> 01:06.311
Okay. As you can see
from Figure 6...

01:06.483 --> 01:09.680
...the three-year rate of return
on ExtenzaLife products...

01:09.853 --> 01:11.878
Well, Mr. Young, a rocky start.

01:12.055 --> 01:14.387
But I'll let the board know
we're in good hands.

01:14.557 --> 01:16.047
Thank you.

02:04.507 --> 02:06.031
Ow.

02:14.184 --> 02:16.311
Little bastard.

02:40.877 --> 02:42.242
Ow.

02:43.446 --> 02:45.607
Son of a...

04:32.755 --> 04:34.416
Lauren and Craig will be here.

04:34.590 --> 04:36.114
Remember Craig? He's from South Africa.

04:36.292 --> 04:37.691
Yeah, I remember him.

04:37.894 --> 04:40.454
Are you sure Bobby's gonna be okay
with it?

04:40.630 --> 04:42.928
You know, Beth,
not everybody likes a surprise.

04:43.099 --> 04:45.294
The man loves being
the center of attention.

04:45.468 --> 04:49.131
You know how many times he told me
he didn't want a party for his birthday?

04:49.305 --> 04:52.399
I'm glad you're coming. It's been ages
since we've had a chance to really talk.

04:53.776 --> 04:56.802
Yeah, can you hold on one sec?
I've got another call.

04:57.413 --> 04:58.505
Hello?

04:58.681 --> 05:02.549
I need you to pick up the others
and get to Marlboro Airport.

05:02.719 --> 05:06.883
I'm gonna tell you something. You're
gonna think I'm joking, I'm not. I quit.

05:07.056 --> 05:08.887
Only just for the next couple of days.

05:09.058 --> 05:12.221
I'm happy to rejoin the others
after the weekend.

05:12.428 --> 05:16.694
Runway 14.
The plane will be waiting.

05:20.803 --> 05:22.862
So where are we going?

05:33.316 --> 05:36.717
Just your average
multinational corporation specializing in...

05:36.886 --> 05:38.854
...secret bio research
and defense contracting.

05:39.022 --> 05:42.355
Massive Dynamic. Seems like such
an innocent name for a corporation...

05:42.525 --> 05:43.719
...don't you think?

05:43.893 --> 05:45.485
- That's odd.
- What?

05:45.661 --> 05:47.424
The lacerations on the body.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.998
These, no doubt,
were caused by shards of glass...

05:51.167 --> 05:52.600
...but these under the shirt...

05:52.769 --> 05:56.068
If they were caused by the glass,
how come the shirt's not torn?

05:56.706 --> 06:00.540
A fall of such height would cause
compound fractures...

06:00.710 --> 06:02.200
...massive internal bleeding...

06:02.378 --> 06:05.176
...all in evidence in this poor chap,
I'm sorry to say.

06:05.348 --> 06:08.511
But wounds this delicate
are most unlikely.

06:08.684 --> 06:12.085
- So, what do you think caused them?
- Too early to tell.

06:12.255 --> 06:15.088
It's a shame I don't have a lab,
I'd like to examine him.

06:15.258 --> 06:17.726
You do have a lab, Walter. Your lab.
At Harvard.

06:17.894 --> 06:19.555
Yes, I do, don't I?

06:41.150 --> 06:42.913
Mark Young
was a capable executive...

06:43.086 --> 06:45.577
...who displayed no signs
of emotional dysfunction.

06:45.755 --> 06:48.622
He was one
of our more promising analysts, in fact.

06:48.791 --> 06:50.588
Popular among his coworkers.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.752
So why do you think
he would jump to his death?

06:54.564 --> 06:56.657
I don't wanna sound callous,
Agent Dunham...

06:56.833 --> 07:01.463
...but when you run a company
of over 300,000 employees...

07:01.637 --> 07:04.105
...you sometimes see
a small percentage...

07:04.273 --> 07:07.606
...who succumb
to the stress of their responsibilities...

07:07.777 --> 07:11.406
...and, on occasion,
the nature of our work.

07:11.581 --> 07:14.812
What do you mean by that,
"The nature our work"?

07:14.984 --> 07:17.851
I was simply referring to the pressure
to deliver results...

07:18.054 --> 07:20.921
...which the private sector
seems to require.

07:21.090 --> 07:22.785
You would find it exhilarating.

07:22.959 --> 07:25.928
Trying to change the subject
by offering me another job?

07:26.095 --> 07:29.690
Well, I'd hate to sound like a suitor
who's constantly being turned down.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.164
Just to be clear, as flattered as I am...

07:32.335 --> 07:35.634
...I'm going to go
wherever this investigation takes me.

07:36.572 --> 07:37.937
I would expect nothing less.

07:38.508 --> 07:43.343
And I would expect more from you than
the polite appearance of cooperation.

07:44.647 --> 07:48.208
You knew this man.
He was a rising star in your company.

07:48.384 --> 07:51.012
There must be something more
you can tell me about him.

07:55.791 --> 07:59.887
When one's domain
includes the cutting edge of science...

08:00.096 --> 08:06.160
...there is a risk of exposure
to ideas that aren't easy to reconcile...

08:06.335 --> 08:08.963
...certain realities.

08:09.472 --> 08:13.067
I'm sure you know what I mean,
doing the work that you do.

08:13.242 --> 08:16.973
For some, it's too much to take.

08:19.549 --> 08:25.010
You ever wonder how we survived
as a species without drugs?

08:26.622 --> 08:29.056
The hard drive
is password-protected.

08:29.225 --> 08:31.921
Once we break the encryption,
we'll send you his data.

08:32.128 --> 08:33.720
Thank you.

08:43.139 --> 08:47.075
He wasn't planning on killing himself
three days ago. He booked a plane ticket.

08:47.243 --> 08:50.838
- To where?
- Omaha. On the 22nd of December.

08:51.013 --> 08:53.208
Christmas in Nebraska.
Sounds depressing.

08:53.382 --> 08:56.374
Yeah, well,
maybe he's got family there.

09:07.730 --> 09:09.789
You find something?

09:12.235 --> 09:13.930
No.

09:15.871 --> 09:17.964
Seems my suspicions were correct.

09:18.174 --> 09:21.541
These wounds go all the way down
to the bone itself.

09:21.711 --> 09:24.441
As if they originated on the inside...

09:24.614 --> 09:28.482
...and pierced their way up
through the body tissue.

09:28.684 --> 09:30.618
How did that happen?

09:30.786 --> 09:33.653
That is an excellent question.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.587
Peter, do you know
what I've been remembering?

09:36.759 --> 09:38.886
Aspects of your childhood.

09:39.228 --> 09:41.560
That's charming, Walter.
Blood samples are ready.

09:41.731 --> 09:44.598
Anything in there
that explains those lacerations?

09:44.767 --> 09:48.225
No, I don't believe so.
Typical medications.

09:48.404 --> 09:50.804
All of them surprisingly legal.

09:50.973 --> 09:53.567
- So they wouldn't have harmed him?
- That is correct.

09:53.743 --> 09:57.611
Although, they could have been used
as a carrier...

09:57.780 --> 10:01.773
...to transfer the foreign compound
to the victim's brain.

10:01.951 --> 10:03.282
What foreign compound?

10:03.452 --> 10:08.446
Oh, didn't I mention it? A synthetic
in the blood. An ergoline derivative.

10:08.624 --> 10:11.491
Perhaps he was treated for migraines.

10:11.661 --> 10:15.620
But it does not explain
what caused these wounds.

10:17.466 --> 10:18.524
Coffee yogurt.

10:18.734 --> 10:20.861
- The synthetic compound?
- Peter.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.097
When he was 13,
all he would eat was coffee yogurt.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.032
Almost drove his mother to tears.

10:27.410 --> 10:29.139
Walter, that wasn't me, that was you.

10:31.113 --> 10:33.377
- Hello?
- If that's Agent Dunham...

10:33.549 --> 10:35.517
...tell her to bring some coffee yogurt.

10:35.685 --> 10:37.710
Can you hold on for one second?

10:37.887 --> 10:41.015
He's right about the yogurt.

10:41.190 --> 10:44.717
In case you haven't noticed,
I can be quite obsessive.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.452
Really?

10:47.196 --> 10:49.528
- Hey. You still there?
- Yeah.

10:49.699 --> 10:52.793
I'm sorry.
I just didn't realize what it would do...

10:52.968 --> 10:55.198
...hearing your voice.

10:55.371 --> 10:56.395
- Listen...
- No, listen.

10:56.572 --> 11:00.133
Don't bother making up a story, Peter.
I know you're back.

11:00.309 --> 11:02.140
I need to see you.

11:02.645 --> 11:04.306
Peter?

11:06.182 --> 11:10.050
- I can't get away right now.
- Well, then when?

13:52.882 --> 13:55.715
Hey Liv, what do you know
about a bunch of frogs?

13:55.885 --> 13:58.718
I just got a P.O. request
from Agent Farnsworth...

13:58.888 --> 14:02.551
...asking to send a terrarium
and 10 pounds of live insect larvae...

14:02.725 --> 14:05.091
...and charge it off
to the Mark Young case.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.092
Is there something
you wanna talk to me about?

14:07.263 --> 14:08.753
Uh...

14:09.164 --> 14:12.361
I had some frogs transferred
to Walter's lab.

14:12.535 --> 14:15.026
These frogs.
You think they have something to do...

14:15.204 --> 14:17.365
...with why the guy
jumped out of the window?

14:17.706 --> 14:19.469
Probably not.

14:21.176 --> 14:22.734
Okay.

14:24.914 --> 14:27.974
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

14:28.384 --> 14:30.113
Come with me.

14:33.489 --> 14:37.220
You know after John died you told me
that I should maybe take some time off.

14:37.393 --> 14:40.385
You said that what happened with him
was going to affect me...

14:40.563 --> 14:42.394
...in ways
I couldn't even anticipate.

14:42.565 --> 14:44.931
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.000
You were right.

14:47.803 --> 14:51.967
I feel like I'm going
clinically insane. Literally.

14:52.141 --> 14:55.872
I told you I saw him
standing right in front of me.

14:56.512 --> 14:58.503
This happened again?

14:59.048 --> 15:02.142
And he's called me,
and he sent me an e-mail.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.752
And at first
I thought it was him helping me.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.320
Like when we were partners.

15:09.625 --> 15:10.990
I know how it sounds.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.321
Have you spoken to Doctor Katz?

15:13.529 --> 15:18.466
Even though it's confidential,
I'll still have a psych eval on my record.

15:19.134 --> 15:21.898
I know it seems so selfish
to even say it...

15:22.071 --> 15:25.165
...but I was thinking maybe
I could just take a personal leave...

15:25.341 --> 15:30.677
...just do nothing for a week or two
and maybe clear my head.

15:30.846 --> 15:34.976
- You think that'll help?
- I don't know.

15:41.256 --> 15:43.451
- Dunham.
- Agent Dunham, it's me.

15:43.626 --> 15:45.594
Dr. Bishop wants you back immediately.

15:45.761 --> 15:48.025
- He thinks you've cracked the case.
- What?

15:48.197 --> 15:52.634
You are not gonna believe this, but
the guy who jumped out the window?

15:52.801 --> 15:55.292
Dr. Bishop thinks
it's because of the frogs.

16:09.952 --> 16:11.749
Oh, thanks.

16:17.926 --> 16:20.224
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:25.501 --> 16:29.733
- I wasn't sure you'd be here.
- That makes two of us.

16:30.973 --> 16:31.997
You look good, Tess.

16:33.275 --> 16:34.765
- You look older.
- Older?

16:34.943 --> 16:37.343
When my father saw me,
he thought I'd be fatter...

16:37.513 --> 16:39.344
...but older actually kind of hurts.

16:39.515 --> 16:42.575
Your father?
Since when do you see your father?

16:42.751 --> 16:45.276
- It's a long story.
- Wait, listen to me.

16:45.454 --> 16:49.288
- If I can find you, then they can find you.
- I know.

16:49.692 --> 16:51.785
They'll hurt you.

16:55.898 --> 16:58.662
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
Something to eat maybe?

17:00.169 --> 17:03.468
Nothing changes with you, huh?
It's the same old Peter.

17:03.639 --> 17:05.971
You play it fast and loose
until it's too late.

17:06.141 --> 17:09.770
It was easy to leave the first time.
Why should it be any different now?

17:09.944 --> 17:12.310
I know that you believe that, Tess.

17:12.481 --> 17:15.108
But you have to trust me,
it was harder than you think.

17:17.352 --> 17:19.479
Trust you?

17:19.954 --> 17:22.480
I'm not sure I ever even knew you.

17:26.060 --> 17:28.051
Yeah, you did.

17:30.332 --> 17:33.665
Maybe better than anyone.
You still do.

17:35.204 --> 17:37.434
What does that say about you?

17:38.207 --> 17:39.640
I'm not kidding.

17:40.309 --> 17:44.006
You need to leave Boston
and never come back, ever.

17:44.179 --> 17:46.545
- Is that what you want?
- How can you ask me that?

17:46.715 --> 17:48.706
Tess, look, it's comp...

17:57.826 --> 17:59.555
- Michael.
- Things have changed.

17:59.728 --> 18:01.559
Yeah, apparently.

18:01.730 --> 18:04.756
It'll be worse for you if you stay.

18:18.013 --> 18:21.540
Psychophysiologic effects,
otherwise known as psychosomatic.

18:21.717 --> 18:25.915
The ability of the mind to cause
actual physical changes in the body.

18:26.088 --> 18:29.080
Mind over matter, like when
you get scared and get goosebumps.

18:29.258 --> 18:32.056
Precisely. Although it is possible
for the body...

18:32.227 --> 18:35.060
...to manifest physical changes
imagined in the brain...

18:35.230 --> 18:37.596
...in a far more dramatic fashion.

18:37.766 --> 18:41.293
This test subject
is in a highly suggestible state...

18:41.503 --> 18:44.631
...as you can see
in this archive footage.

18:48.143 --> 18:52.773
A form of hypnosis. I convinced him
that he was in a meat locker.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.239
And what is more impressive...

18:55.417 --> 18:59.820
...I told him that this ice cube
was a burning coal.

19:08.263 --> 19:12.324
- Oh, my God.
- Cruel, I suppose. But very enlightening.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.434
So, Walter,
what does this have to do with frogs?

19:15.604 --> 19:18.129
Toads, actually, Bufo Alvarius.

19:18.307 --> 19:22.334
A species which secretes
a psychoactive compound.

19:22.544 --> 19:25.980
The substance which I couldn't identify
in Mr. Young...

19:26.148 --> 19:31.586
...was in fact a concentration
of the venom produced in the skin.

19:31.753 --> 19:35.280
Properly altered, it's an hallucinogen.
A very powerful one.

19:35.457 --> 19:37.652
Quite unlike anything I have taken.

19:37.826 --> 19:42.627
It directly affects the amygdala,
which is the fear center of the brain.

19:43.665 --> 19:46.998
So you're saying that Mark Young
hallucinated being cut on his body...

19:47.169 --> 19:49.262
...then his mind
made it actually happen.

19:49.438 --> 19:53.704
- Yes, a very clever means of murder.
- What do you mean, murder?

19:53.876 --> 19:56.276
Oh, come on,
I'm sure we have discussed this.

19:56.445 --> 19:59.812
No, no, you and I did.
Before Olivia got here.

20:01.016 --> 20:04.508
The potency of the dose that I found
in Mr. Young's blood...

20:04.686 --> 20:08.554
...was at least 30 times that
that any sane person would ingest...

20:08.724 --> 20:12.524
...which suggests that someone else
gave him the drugs.

20:12.694 --> 20:15.788
So whoever those frogs belong to
may be the killer.

20:15.964 --> 20:19.058
I ran a record search on the basement
where you found the toads...

20:19.234 --> 20:20.633
...but nothing came up.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.861
How did you even find it
in the first place?

20:24.106 --> 20:26.131
It's a long story.

20:29.611 --> 20:30.908
Walter. Walter.

20:31.914 --> 20:36.817
The shed where I found the frogs?
John Scott led me to it.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.819
You've been seeing him again.

20:43.492 --> 20:46.154
Because his memories
are still in your head.

20:46.695 --> 20:49.357
- His memories?
- Yes.

20:49.531 --> 20:54.594
Trapped like fragments,
snapshots in your mind.

20:54.770 --> 20:59.434
Your work on this case must be
a trigger to some knowledge he had.

20:59.641 --> 21:00.835
So how long?

21:03.845 --> 21:06.006
I mean, how long is this gonna
keep happening?

21:07.049 --> 21:08.516
It could last for many years.

21:10.419 --> 21:12.580
I need to get it out.

21:12.754 --> 21:16.747
I can't keep having John's life
flash in front of my eyes every few days.

21:16.925 --> 21:19.587
There must be something you can do.

21:21.596 --> 21:23.359
Perhaps...

21:24.933 --> 21:30.872
...using a form
of repressed memory therapy...

21:31.039 --> 21:33.735
...we may be able to bring the memories
to the surface...

21:33.909 --> 21:36.742
...and purge them
from your unconscious.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.812
- But...
- But you'd have to put me in the tank.

21:43.085 --> 21:45.781
Yes. Yes.

21:45.954 --> 21:47.945
And I would always
advise against that.

21:48.123 --> 21:51.490
The risk of physical, not to mention
mental damage it might cause...

21:51.693 --> 21:53.422
...could be catastrophic.

21:53.595 --> 21:54.619
Walter, I'll do it.

22:00.302 --> 22:02.463
I need to do it.

22:29.531 --> 22:31.658
- Yeah.
- Peter, it's Agent Farnsworth.

22:31.833 --> 22:34.301
- Where are you?
- Putting gas in the car. What's up?

22:34.469 --> 22:37.632
I think you should just come back.

23:05.767 --> 23:08.133
Ow. Walter.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.465
How long is this going to take?

23:15.644 --> 23:17.509
Ms. Dunham, what we're doing...

23:17.679 --> 23:20.876
What you have asked me to do
is pushing the boundaries...

23:21.049 --> 23:24.075
...of all that is real and possible.

23:24.286 --> 23:26.220
We're not roasting a turkey.

23:26.388 --> 23:29.482
The library was not open.
I had to go to the bookstore.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.489
What for?

23:33.528 --> 23:38.795
When you're in the tank, you must listen
to my voice at all times.

23:39.801 --> 23:45.068
This is a technique I developed
decades ago, in this very lab.

23:45.240 --> 23:46.935
Most of which I don't remember.

23:47.109 --> 23:49.669
- Is Peter coming?
- Yes.

23:49.845 --> 23:53.679
- Is that a Bible?
- Yes.

23:57.085 --> 23:59.610
Last time you were in
the sensory deprivation tank...

23:59.821 --> 24:03.348
...you entered a state of shared
consciousness with Agent Scott.

24:03.525 --> 24:08.690
During that time, part of his memories
crossed over into your brain.

24:08.864 --> 24:12.231
By putting you into a state
of deep hypnosis...

24:12.400 --> 24:15.597
...and by giving you substantial doses
of psychoactive drugs...

24:15.770 --> 24:21.299
...I can help you to access those alien
memories that your mind has repressed.

24:21.476 --> 24:26.971
My voice is your guide.
It is also your tether to reality.

24:27.149 --> 24:32.883
You must focus on my voice, or
you may risk being lost in the memories.

24:33.822 --> 24:35.813
Uh-oh.

24:38.493 --> 24:40.757
- What?
- I just got an erection.

24:42.464 --> 24:45.126
Oh. Fear not. It's nothing to do
with your state of undress.

24:45.300 --> 24:48.064
- I think I simply need to urinate.
- That's good to know.

24:49.271 --> 24:51.432
Would you get her in the tank, please?

25:12.627 --> 25:15.528
Are you sure about doing this again?

25:17.832 --> 25:20.665
All I want is for it to stop.

25:20.835 --> 25:24.362
But if these memories
can do some good...

25:24.539 --> 25:27.508
...then at least I wasn't deceived
for nothing.

25:27.676 --> 25:30.304
You'll begin to feel sleepy.

25:30.478 --> 25:34.778
You must listen to my voice
at all times.

25:34.950 --> 25:40.479
Concentrate on the name of the man
from whom you seek information.

25:40.655 --> 25:42.520
And look for signs.

25:43.191 --> 25:44.215
Signs?

25:46.995 --> 25:49.327
I'll tell you when you get there.

25:51.066 --> 25:54.365
Walter, what was the Bible for?

25:56.805 --> 26:00.172
Well, you're taking
untested psychedelics...

26:00.342 --> 26:05.075
...lying in saline with an electric charge
in the base of your cranium.

26:05.247 --> 26:07.511
Among other things,
I thought it appropriate...

26:07.682 --> 26:09.877
...to pray you don't get electrocuted.

26:10.752 --> 26:15.587
- Praise the Lord.
- Amen.

26:23.965 --> 26:25.398
Next.

26:25.567 --> 26:28.730
"Then I will sprinkle clean water
upon you..."

26:28.937 --> 26:30.734
And ye shall be clean.

26:30.939 --> 26:34.670
And of all thy filthiness, and all thy idols
I will cleanse thee.

26:34.843 --> 26:41.646
And a new spirit I will give to thee,
and a new spirit I will put within thee.

26:42.384 --> 26:45.683
Wow, nice.
I didn't know you were so religious.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.651
I'm not. Not anymore.

26:47.822 --> 26:52.350
- Olivia, can you hear me?
- Yes.

26:52.527 --> 26:54.188
Good.

26:54.896 --> 26:58.696
You see the end of the escalator,
Olivia.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.597
You will step off in five...

27:02.037 --> 27:06.531
...four, three, two, one.

27:08.076 --> 27:12.376
Take a moment. Look around.
What do you see?

27:13.581 --> 27:17.677
I see nothing. Just light.

27:17.852 --> 27:24.382
Olivia, listen carefully. Apart from
my voice, what else do you hear?

27:26.761 --> 27:29.025
- Music.
- Excellent.

27:29.197 --> 27:32.064
Where's it coming from?
You should be able to see something.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.870
There's nothing.

27:37.772 --> 27:40.104
I don't know where I am.

27:41.276 --> 27:42.402
Stand by.

27:47.148 --> 27:50.606
Anything now? What do you see?

27:51.653 --> 27:53.587
Nothing.

27:55.390 --> 27:56.618
Wait.

28:03.431 --> 28:04.557
There's a door.

28:04.733 --> 28:11.104
Good. Walk through it.
Tell me where you end up.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.351
I'm in a restaurant.

28:28.656 --> 28:30.851
Does it look familiar?

28:32.327 --> 28:34.158
Sort of.

28:35.430 --> 28:36.920
But I don't know why.

28:42.137 --> 28:45.004
This is where we had our first date.

28:47.475 --> 28:50.808
And there we are.
This is our first date.

28:51.613 --> 28:54.309
Can you see yourself? And John?

28:54.482 --> 28:57.974
- What's going on?
- She's gone back in.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.450
What?

28:59.621 --> 29:02.613
- Olivia went back in the tank? Why?
- Son, I need your help.

29:02.791 --> 29:05.021
- You said this was dangerous.
- Oh, it is, very.

29:05.193 --> 29:08.356
She thinks John had information
about the man who killed himself.

29:08.530 --> 29:10.964
She went back in the tank
to talk to John Scott?

29:11.132 --> 29:13.327
To see his memories.

29:13.535 --> 29:17.471
Look at him. He looks so alive.

29:17.972 --> 29:20.202
- Maybe.
- What do you mean, "maybe"?

29:20.542 --> 29:22.203
You'll see.

29:22.410 --> 29:24.537
So real.

29:25.613 --> 29:28.912
- I need you to adjust the drugs.
- What did you give her this time?

29:29.117 --> 29:34.646
Drugs I'd rather be taking myself.
Set the IV to 10 drips per.

29:34.823 --> 29:36.654
Peter, please.

29:51.639 --> 29:56.372
- I'm getting up. What should I do?
- Fear not, this is just a memory.

29:57.512 --> 30:01.073
You're just visiting.
They cannot see you.

30:01.749 --> 30:03.649
He's alone.

30:13.027 --> 30:14.221
John?

30:17.365 --> 30:20.061
He cannot hear you or speak
with you. You're in a memory.

30:20.235 --> 30:23.136
He cannot interact with you.

30:23.304 --> 30:26.296
Olivia, I'm going to take
you elsewhere.

30:28.476 --> 30:30.068
I loved you.

30:32.547 --> 30:36.449
Tonight, during dinner...

30:38.019 --> 30:40.487
...I loved you.

30:46.728 --> 30:49.561
But you were lying to me
about who you were.

30:49.731 --> 30:52.131
I mean, did you have any feelings
for me at all?

30:52.300 --> 30:54.461
Or was it all just...

31:07.081 --> 31:09.481
Mark Young killed himself yesterday.

31:11.519 --> 31:12.611
He sees me.

31:14.889 --> 31:17.619
No, Olivia.
He definitely does not see you.

31:27.001 --> 31:31.665
I'm somewhere else.
I'm in John's car.

31:31.839 --> 31:34.171
Good. Do you see any clues?

31:34.342 --> 31:38.438
- I'm alone.
- He must be there.

31:38.613 --> 31:40.478
Find out where you are.

31:47.655 --> 31:48.815
There's no one here.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.754
It's his memory.
He must be there somewhere.

31:55.129 --> 31:56.153
I see them.

31:58.199 --> 31:59.962
Who? Ask her what she sees.

32:00.668 --> 32:05.128
- What do you see?
- There's four men.

32:05.306 --> 32:10.334
There's John, a black guy, one who
looks Latino, and the fourth, I can't see.

32:10.812 --> 32:12.143
I don't know who they are.

32:13.982 --> 32:17.816
Just give him a minute. This is
a big decision he's about to make.

32:19.087 --> 32:20.145
All right, I'm good.

32:20.321 --> 32:23.722
Oh, my God. It's Mark Young.
I see him. He's here.

32:26.227 --> 32:28.752
- Can you hear anything?
- All right.

32:28.930 --> 32:30.295
I'll get closer.

32:31.366 --> 32:33.800
Young's leaving with the Latino.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.799
I'm going after them.

32:38.106 --> 32:41.041
Now, you just do your part,
and we'll take care of you.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.541
We do this one deal,
and it's hasta luego.

32:50.118 --> 32:51.710
They've disappeared.

32:51.886 --> 32:54.514
Because you're not in
their memories. You're in John's.

32:54.689 --> 32:55.951
You must go back to him.

32:58.826 --> 33:01.556
- You know, if it's on time...
- It will be.

33:01.729 --> 33:04.425
He'll deliver. He's just a little nervous.

33:04.599 --> 33:08.126
Did you see the look when you told
him how much you'd be willing to offer?

33:08.336 --> 33:09.360
I hope you're right.

33:09.537 --> 33:12.597
If we get into another Ashby situation,
we're screwed.

33:17.245 --> 33:21.204
No. Stop. No. Get me out of here.
Walter.

33:32.060 --> 33:37.930
- So just a little less chin.
- Okay. How's this?

33:38.099 --> 33:41.068
That's it. That's the Latino guy
I saw in John's memory.

33:41.235 --> 33:43.328
He's the only one of the four
still alive.

33:43.504 --> 33:45.836
We need to figure out who he is
and find him.

33:46.007 --> 33:48.498
Can we get this to Charlie?
Maybe we can get it ID'd.

33:48.676 --> 33:50.166
Got it.

33:52.780 --> 33:55.078
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:55.917 --> 33:58.385
- You're on my clothes.
- Oh, sorry.

33:58.553 --> 34:00.384
That's all right.

34:00.555 --> 34:03.422
- You okay?
- Yeah.

34:10.498 --> 34:13.489
John's memories gave us a lead.

34:14.534 --> 34:18.027
So I better get a move on.
I need to see Broyles.

34:18.572 --> 34:19.699
You want some company?

34:19.873 --> 34:21.501
No.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.735
Thanks.

34:26.114 --> 34:28.878
Olivia, if you need me, I'm here.

34:30.752 --> 34:34.016
Yeah. I know.

34:35.590 --> 34:38.286
We believe Young was murdered
for selling technologies...

34:38.458 --> 34:39.926
...to black-market buyers.

34:40.094 --> 34:42.960
We believe that this man
is part of an underground group...

34:43.130 --> 34:46.567
...responsible for brokering the sale
of a synthetic hallucinogen...

34:46.734 --> 34:49.328
...manufactured by Massive Dynamic's
drug division.

34:49.804 --> 34:52.931
What would be the black-market
applications of this hallucinogen?

34:53.107 --> 34:55.735
The drug could be mass-produced
as a street drug...

34:55.909 --> 34:59.937
...or worse, in its potent form,
used as a chemical weapon.

35:00.114 --> 35:02.674
Apparently, it can literally scare you
to death.

35:02.850 --> 35:06.286
Then don't let me slow you down.
Sounds like you're doing fine.

35:06.454 --> 35:08.479
There's just one more thing.

35:08.656 --> 35:11.591
We're gonna need Massive Dynamic
to disclose every project...

35:11.759 --> 35:13.818
...that Mark Young was working on.

35:15.129 --> 35:16.426
You're right.

35:16.597 --> 35:21.193
Although that'll be easier said than done.
I'll see what I can do.

35:52.533 --> 35:55.297
If you touch her again, I'll kill you.

36:15.723 --> 36:16.747
Any luck?

36:16.924 --> 36:19.722
We're running facial-recognition
software. No matches.

36:19.894 --> 36:20.918
Witness sightings?

36:21.128 --> 36:24.393
NYPD's passing the composite around
Young's building as we speak.

36:24.565 --> 36:27.898
Yeah, I need you to cross-reference
all of John Scott's case files...

36:28.069 --> 36:31.163
...with Mark Young. Yeah.

36:31.339 --> 36:32.636
Hold on.

36:33.207 --> 36:36.370
From Nina Sharp.
Mark Young's projects.

36:41.549 --> 36:45.781
Yeah, can you call me back
if you find something? Thank you.

37:35.636 --> 37:37.467
Hello?

37:38.906 --> 37:42.672
Hello. I'm calling on behalf
of your long-distance carrier.

37:42.843 --> 37:45.471
I'm not interested.
And I don't want you calling again.

37:45.646 --> 37:47.307
So take me off your list, okay?

37:47.481 --> 37:49.278
Hasta luego.

37:51.218 --> 37:54.278
We do this one deal,
and it's hasta luego.

37:56.657 --> 37:58.955
I need this phone traced.
This is our guy.

37:59.126 --> 38:01.356
- How do you know?
- I recognize his voice.

38:02.163 --> 38:06.657
- You recognize his voice?
- It's him, Charlie, I swear.

38:07.301 --> 38:09.792
- Come on.
- Almost there.

38:09.971 --> 38:12.371
It's a landline,
but it was forwarded to his cell.

38:12.540 --> 38:15.600
- Where?
- He's in transit, on Route 3.

38:15.776 --> 38:17.869
Heading to Lincoln Tunnel.

38:28.255 --> 38:31.122
- How far out are we?
- About a mile and closing.

38:32.393 --> 38:36.830
We got him. Name on the account
is George Morales, age 43.

38:36.998 --> 38:41.731
Purchased a plane ticket this morning,
3:45 flight to Sao Paulo out of JFK.

38:41.902 --> 38:43.460
He must be on his way there now.

38:43.637 --> 38:46.401
According to NCIC,
he's a black-market trafficker.

38:46.574 --> 38:49.236
- So how far out are we?
- Five hundred and fifty yards.

38:49.410 --> 38:52.902
Echo flank left. Foxtrot flank right.

38:54.048 --> 38:56.380
- Wait, he stopped.
- Did we lose the signal?

38:56.550 --> 38:59.246
- No, he just stopped.
- Do you think he ditched his phone?

38:59.420 --> 39:01.980
I don't know why.
There's no way he spotted us.

39:08.596 --> 39:12.157
- Looks like he hit traffic.
- Where's the transponder? Let's go.

39:37.458 --> 39:38.720
Charlie.

40:05.219 --> 40:07.949
You okay? Call 911.

40:10.791 --> 40:12.520
He's okay.

40:32.012 --> 40:35.209
- I'm told you wanted to see me.
- Yes.

40:35.683 --> 40:39.050
I wanna make a deal.
I'll tell you everything I know.

40:39.220 --> 40:41.745
I'm not sure what you have to trade.

40:41.922 --> 40:46.359
Under title 18 of US code, we have you
for possession of chemical weapons...

40:46.527 --> 40:49.394
...on top of suspicion
of murder of Mark Young.

40:49.563 --> 40:51.394
- I want protection.
- You mean immunity.

40:51.565 --> 40:54.728
No, I mean protection.
From Massive Dynamic.

40:54.902 --> 40:56.767
You need to move me from here
right now.

40:56.937 --> 40:59.963
- What are you talking about?
- I didn't kill anybody.

41:00.174 --> 41:01.198
Why would I?

41:01.375 --> 41:04.276
That guy was a treasure trove
of unbelievable things.

41:04.445 --> 41:06.777
Massive Dynamic killed him.

41:15.923 --> 41:19.324
- Massive Dynamic killed Mark Young?
- That's right.

41:19.493 --> 41:21.757
- Why?
- Maybe as a warning to any employee...

41:21.929 --> 41:23.590
...thinking of doing
the same thing.

41:23.764 --> 41:28.497
Maybe? I think it's easy to invent a story
that you think I wanna hear.

41:28.702 --> 41:35.574
Really? Did I invent ZFT? Flight 627?
The North Woods Group?

41:36.210 --> 41:40.647
John Scott? The Pattern?
The whole thing is a hoax.

41:40.814 --> 41:42.475
It's all a smoke screen.

41:42.650 --> 41:45.016
So Massive Dynamic
can do whatever it wants...

41:45.219 --> 41:47.983
...to whoever it wants.
Do you understand that?

41:48.656 --> 41:53.855
Massive Dynamic is hell,
and its founder, William Bell, is the devil.

41:54.028 --> 41:58.226
And I can prove all of it.
But only if I get protection.

41:58.632 --> 42:02.864
So why me? Why do I get the privilege
of your cooperation?

42:03.037 --> 42:06.006
- Because I know I can trust you.
- You don't even know me.

42:06.173 --> 42:08.607
John Scott told me about you.

42:10.511 --> 42:13.503
Immunity and complete protection...

42:13.681 --> 42:18.015
...and I will tell you
everything I know.

42:25.025 --> 42:27.960
Agent Dunham. I don't recall
seeing you on my schedule today.

42:28.128 --> 42:30.460
Well, I don't need an appointment,
Miss Sharp.

42:32.366 --> 42:34.061
It's all right.

42:35.202 --> 42:40.731
No matter where my investigations
take me, they always come back here.

42:40.908 --> 42:43.968
I don't know what you've heard
since we last saw each other...

42:44.144 --> 42:47.978
...but I hope my cooperation would have
garnered some benefit of the doubt.

42:48.148 --> 42:51.174
Massive Dynamic has nothing to hide.

43:01.362 --> 43:05.731
It's about time.
What took you so long?

43:12.306 --> 43:15.503
See, I believe that your cooperation
is an illusion.

43:16.076 --> 43:20.376
It never leads to something tangible.
It only leads to more questions.

43:21.081 --> 43:24.448
And that's the point, isn't it?

43:25.185 --> 43:29.952
To keep us all asking questions,
all just chasing our own tails?

43:30.124 --> 43:32.285
Are you sure you're feeling well,
Ms. Dunham?

43:32.459 --> 43:37.055
I think perhaps you're perceiving things
that are entirely in your mind's eye.

43:48.108 --> 43:50.201
I wanted to thank you
for your job offers.

43:50.377 --> 43:53.210
I'm sorry that it's taken me so long
to give you an answer.

43:53.380 --> 43:59.444
- But I think I finally have one.
- Yes. It's obvious in your expression.

44:01.221 --> 44:03.883
Well, I understand
that you've captured your suspect.

44:04.058 --> 44:08.085
I imagine that in an effort to seek an
immunity agreement from your agency...

44:08.262 --> 44:10.730
...he's attempting to blame
Massive Dynamic...

44:10.898 --> 44:12.627
...for all his foul deeds.

44:13.167 --> 44:16.933
Are you protecting your CEO,
William Bell?

44:17.805 --> 44:21.070
Because if you are,
now is the time to tell me.

44:21.675 --> 44:25.668
Once our witness talks,
you lose all leverage in a plea.

44:25.879 --> 44:29.246
I seriously doubt that your witness
will be able to provide...

44:29.416 --> 44:32.442
...any actionable evidence
to implicate Massive Dynamic...

44:32.619 --> 44:35.611
...or William Bell of any wrongdoing.

44:42.763 --> 44:47.132
No. Please. No, John,
please, don't... I won't say anything.

44:48.102 --> 44:50.161
I won't say anything.

45:08.055 --> 45:09.113
Dunham.

45:09.289 --> 45:11.154
- Our witness is dead.
- What?

45:11.325 --> 45:14.556
It seems he was drugged
with the same substance as Mark Young.

45:14.728 --> 45:17.060
How? We had guards on his room.

45:17.231 --> 45:21.463
We don't know yet. But a nurse saw
his throat open up right before her eyes.

45:21.635 --> 45:24.126
- Nina Sharp.
- Excuse me?

45:24.304 --> 45:27.364
She got to him. And there'll be
no evidence, just like you said.

45:27.541 --> 45:30.237
Dunham,
Nina Sharp and Massive Dynamic...

45:30.411 --> 45:33.107
...have been nothing but cooperative
with this investigation.

45:33.280 --> 45:37.512
I suggest you keep
your unfounded accusations in check.

45:51.365 --> 45:54.425
Walter. Hi.

45:54.601 --> 45:56.535
Can you come...?

45:59.473 --> 46:01.566
Uh, I need to go back in.

46:03.544 --> 46:05.739
- In our room?
- Uh, no.

46:05.913 --> 46:08.711
In the tank.
There are too many questions.

46:08.882 --> 46:11.043
Like who's working for whom,
and why.

46:11.218 --> 46:14.881
Who should be arrested, who's plotting
what, and if John had the answers...

46:15.055 --> 46:18.218
...the answers are in his memory,
which means they're in my memory.

46:18.392 --> 46:20.417
- Miss Dunham...
- Please, we're wasting time.

46:20.594 --> 46:24.758
- It's dangerous.
- I am prepared to take that risk.

46:30.404 --> 46:33.601
There is little that makes me happier
than taking drugs.

46:34.007 --> 46:37.443
Perhaps administering them.

46:37.611 --> 46:40.910
Designing and carrying out
experiments...

46:41.081 --> 46:44.209
...that bend the plane
of what we consider reality.

46:44.384 --> 46:48.377
I am rarely, if ever,
opposed to such things except now.

46:49.089 --> 46:51.956
But I tell you,
you will damage yourself.

46:52.125 --> 46:54.923
Every time you go back in,
the risk of permanent damage...

46:55.095 --> 46:58.462
...seizures, aneurisms, memory loss,
death...

46:58.632 --> 47:00.463
If I don't go back in,
others may die.

47:00.634 --> 47:03.797
And if you do,
the death could be your own.

47:05.472 --> 47:09.431
There are no guarantees that you will
retrieve the memories you're looking for.

47:09.610 --> 47:13.410
And remember,
there can be no interaction with him.

47:13.580 --> 47:15.343
You can't just ask.

47:17.351 --> 47:20.343
- He did see me.
- No.

47:20.787 --> 47:23.847
No. That is not possible.

47:25.626 --> 47:31.428
Give me some time. I will try to develop
a safer technique.

47:31.598 --> 47:34.465
But not tonight. You need to rest.

47:39.373 --> 47:41.204
Sleep well.

47:49.383 --> 47:51.146
You too.

47:55.022 --> 47:58.549
Tell him to have the money,
or I'll have to break his legs too.

47:58.725 --> 48:00.488
I gotta go.

48:01.194 --> 48:03.594
What the hell happened to you?

48:04.164 --> 48:08.032
He's back in town. Peter Bishop.

48:08.335 --> 48:10.064
Peter Bishop? Really?

48:11.305 --> 48:17.377
