00:12.170 --> 00:15.368
<i>Tonight's space shuttle
Challenger on launch pad 39B,</i>

00:15.451 --> 00:17.292
<i>as the mammoth spacecraft...</i>

00:18.865 --> 00:20.783
<i>The countdown continues
for tomorrow's launch</i>

00:20.848 --> 00:23.367
<i>of the Space Shuttle Challenger,
with its crew of seven</i>

00:23.368 --> 00:26.049
<i>including New Hampshire
schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe.</i>

00:26.050 --> 00:28.047
<i>But a cloudy and...</i>

00:28.048 --> 00:30.126
<i>As NASA ground crews
prepare the ship...</i>

00:30.127 --> 00:32.409
<i>...officials believe
it will be a go...</i>

00:37.529 --> 00:39.889
<i>The Challenger mission L51
has been...</i>

00:39.890 --> 00:43.448
<i>The 51L mission, ready to go.</i>

00:43.449 --> 00:45.807
<i>At seven o'clock,
the Challenger crew met</i>

00:45.808 --> 00:48.009
<i>for their traditional
pre-flight breakfast...</i>

01:02.568 --> 01:07.527
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the faculty,
students, quiet, please.</i>

01:07.528 --> 01:11.807
<i>Please welcome our esteemed
guest lecturer,</i>

01:11.808 --> 01:14.368
<i>winner of the Einstein Award,</i>

01:14.369 --> 01:18.208
<i>one of the ten most significant
physicists of all time,</i>

01:18.209 --> 01:23.883
<i>winner of the Nobel Prize
in Physics, Dr Richard Feynman.</i>

01:39.768 --> 01:41.926
I bribed him to say
all that nice stuff,

01:41.927 --> 01:43.528
clearly I just escaped from jail.

01:47.608 --> 01:51.047
Energy, from potential to kinetic,

01:51.048 --> 01:52.489
gives you...

01:53.489 --> 01:55.127
You see that?

01:55.128 --> 01:57.288
No, don't write it down.

02:02.168 --> 02:03.968
Not till you know what it means.

02:13.208 --> 02:15.727
This will not hurt you.

02:15.728 --> 02:17.128
It might hurt me.

02:33.488 --> 02:35.928
Why didn't I have you
write down the equation?

02:38.688 --> 02:39.846
You'd write it out.

02:39.847 --> 02:42.128
La-di-la-di-la,
you'd feel pretty smart, right?

02:43.848 --> 02:45.368
But now you understand it.

02:46.448 --> 02:48.567
Mom! Hurry Up! I'm coming.

02:48.568 --> 02:51.206
<i>...about three minutes,
and they think they can do it.</i>

02:51.207 --> 02:53.565
<i>They are counting,
the ice is cleared away,</i>

02:53.566 --> 02:56.325
<i>and Challenger should be
going away very soon.</i>

02:56.326 --> 02:58.125
<i>Let's go down to
the Kennedy Space Center</i>

02:58.126 --> 03:00.205
<i>and take a look at Challenger
sitting on the pad</i>

03:00.206 --> 03:02.325
<i>as they continue the countdown.</i>

03:02.326 --> 03:05.205
<i>Challenger's launch will be
the 25th space shuttle mission.</i>

03:05.206 --> 03:08.325
<i>It's estimated over 30,000 people
have been involved...</i>

03:08.326 --> 03:10.525
Dale, you want some coffee?
Not now, Larry.

03:10.526 --> 03:13.088
<i>...at a total cost
of nearly 40 million...</i>

03:17.888 --> 03:20.806
<i>There goes Christa McAuliffe,
first teacher in space.</i>

03:20.807 --> 03:24.325
<i>During the mission, McAuliffe will
be conducting scientific experiments</i>

03:24.326 --> 03:26.005
<i>which will be beamed live
to children</i>

03:26.006 --> 03:27.685
<i>in schoolrooms across America.</i>

03:27.686 --> 03:30.165
<i>The New Hampshire teacher
has described Challenger</i>

03:30.166 --> 03:31.847
<i>as the ultimate field trip.</i>

03:31.848 --> 03:33.206
What is science?

03:33.207 --> 03:37.083
Science is a way to teach how...

03:37.494 --> 03:40.744
some thing gets to be known.

03:44.287 --> 03:47.726
In as much as anything can be known.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.047
Because nothing is known absolutely.

03:51.606 --> 03:54.446
It's how to handle doubt

03:54.447 --> 03:55.727
and uncertainty.

03:57.647 --> 04:02.126
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...</i>

04:02.127 --> 04:03.687
<i>we have main engine start.</i>

04:03.688 --> 04:07.686
<i>Four, three, two, one...</i>

04:07.687 --> 04:11.686
<i>Lift-off of
the 25th space shuttle mission,</i>

04:11.687 --> 04:14.006
<i>and it has cleared the tower.</i>

04:14.007 --> 04:15.207
Yay!

04:24.966 --> 04:27.445
<i>Roger roll, Challenger.</i>

04:27.446 --> 04:30.205
<i>Challenger, go with throttle.</i>

04:30.206 --> 04:34.127
Science teaches us
what the rules of evidence are.

04:36.247 --> 04:38.647
We mess with that at our peril.

04:43.327 --> 04:45.247
<i>One minute, 15 seconds.</i>

04:50.806 --> 04:54.206
<i>We'll report more as
we have information available.</i>

04:57.886 --> 04:59.966
<i>Checking with the recovery forces.</i>

05:03.846 --> 05:06.046
<i>Obviously a major malfunction.</i>

05:08.726 --> 05:09.966
<i>We have no downlink.</i>

05:27.606 --> 05:30.804
<i>The space agency NASA
has not yet confirmed the deaths</i>

05:30.805 --> 05:33.004
<i>of the schoolteacher
and six other astronauts</i>

05:33.005 --> 05:35.804
<i>who were on board the shuttle
Challenger when it exploded</i>

05:35.805 --> 05:37.524
<i>on take-off this morning in Florida.</i>

05:37.525 --> 05:40.964
<i>But there seems little doubt
that there were any survivors.</i>

05:40.965 --> 05:44.484
<i>NASA is conducting a news
conference at this moment.</i>

05:44.485 --> 05:46.644
<i>Challenger exploded
into a fireball</i>

05:46.645 --> 05:49.365
<i>and pieces came down
in the Atlantic Ocean...</i>

05:49.366 --> 05:53.925
<i>Never in 25 launches of the
space shuttle had a life been lost.</i>

05:53.926 --> 05:56.564
<i>Today, that record
went down in flames.</i>

05:56.565 --> 05:59.644
<i>Tonight the search for survivors
turned up none.</i>

05:59.645 --> 06:02.284
<i>The search for answers
is just starting.</i>

06:02.285 --> 06:04.124
<i>Bruce Hall begins our coverage</i>

06:04.125 --> 06:07.806
<i>of a spaceship that became
a fireball and a national tragedy.</i>

06:07.807 --> 06:09.125
<i>Ready for launch.</i>

06:09.126 --> 06:10.965
<i>And lift-off.</i>

06:10.966 --> 06:13.604
<i>And listen to the cheers
of the young students</i>

06:13.605 --> 06:15.806
<i>of the first ever US
teacher-astronaut.</i>

06:15.807 --> 06:18.684
<i>Moments later,
a massive explosion.</i>

06:18.685 --> 06:21.164
<i>The cheering stops.</i>

06:21.165 --> 06:23.245
I'm sorry, I can't watch this stuff.

06:27.965 --> 06:30.363
<i>Seven Americans
with the highest hopes.</i>

06:30.364 --> 06:33.406
<i>A billion dollars worth
of the highest technology.</i>

06:33.407 --> 06:36.125
<i>Gone in seconds.</i>

06:36.126 --> 06:38.966
<i>The worst disaster
in the US Space Program ever.</i>

06:51.165 --> 06:53.524
Hello. Er, hold on, hold on. No...

06:53.525 --> 06:54.965
Wait!

06:59.605 --> 07:01.965
Feynman menagerie.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.845
Sorry, who is it? Hold on, hold on.

07:09.445 --> 07:10.565
Who's this?

07:11.685 --> 07:12.966
Bill. Bill who?

07:14.325 --> 07:15.605
Bill Graham?

07:17.005 --> 07:19.844
I've got 15,000 former students.

07:19.845 --> 07:22.285
Listen, pal, how did you get
a hold of my home number?

07:24.765 --> 07:26.205
You're head of what?

07:28.525 --> 07:29.765
NASA?

07:49.724 --> 07:51.803
You got your results back yet?

07:51.804 --> 07:53.165
Nope.

07:58.005 --> 07:59.283
What's bugging you?

07:59.284 --> 08:01.165
Had a phone call this morning.

08:04.205 --> 08:05.885
They want me to go to Washington

08:05.886 --> 08:10.284
and sit on a presidential
inquiry thing.

08:10.285 --> 08:12.124
What?

08:12.125 --> 08:14.683
Find out why the shuttle exploded.

08:14.684 --> 08:16.003
Did you say yes?

08:16.004 --> 08:18.444
I'm not even that
into the space programme.

08:19.644 --> 08:22.764
I know people died
and I'm very sorry about that, but...

08:23.844 --> 08:25.283
Gwen...

08:25.284 --> 08:29.603
I do my work, my teaching, you guys.

08:29.604 --> 08:35.083
They just want to say that they
bagged the famous physicist guy.

08:35.085 --> 08:37.684
They're a bunch of bureaucrats
and generals

08:37.686 --> 08:40.325
with pokers up their asses, you know?

08:43.404 --> 08:44.483
What?

08:44.484 --> 08:46.763
You just said it.

08:46.764 --> 08:49.322
They wouldn't know where to look.
You would.

08:49.323 --> 08:52.604
You can't pass up a puzzle,
not as important as this.

08:59.484 --> 09:01.484
I'm sorry, love, you're right.

09:01.485 --> 09:03.164
I wasn't thinking.

09:04.484 --> 09:07.324
Write and explain that
you're not fit enough.

09:07.325 --> 09:09.203
I'm fit. I'm fit.

09:09.204 --> 09:11.523
Who are you kidding?
I'm fit as a fiddle.

09:11.524 --> 09:15.683
What do you Yorkshire folks say?
"I'm fit as a flea. "

09:15.684 --> 09:17.083
You want the proof?

09:17.084 --> 09:18.243
Not especially.

09:18.244 --> 09:20.044
Ohh... you smell so good.

09:21.844 --> 09:23.044
OK, but...

09:24.284 --> 09:25.804
Then you'd have no excuse.

09:29.324 --> 09:30.644
Damn you, woman.

09:35.844 --> 09:37.884
I'll have to wear a tie.

09:41.883 --> 09:44.841
<i>The Captain has turned on
the no smoking signs.</i>

09:44.842 --> 09:48.123
<i>At this time, please extinguish
all smoking materials.</i>

09:57.804 --> 09:59.084
Taxi!

10:07.604 --> 10:08.644
It's cold.

10:09.683 --> 10:11.202
NASA headquarters.

10:11.203 --> 10:13.482
NASA, you got it.

10:13.483 --> 10:14.523
Cold!

10:18.443 --> 10:20.001
<i>With America still in shock</i>

10:20.002 --> 10:21.961
<i>after the world's worst
space disaster,</i>

10:21.962 --> 10:23.961
<i>the address given
by President Reagan</i>

10:23.962 --> 10:25.721
<i>in the hours following the accident</i>

10:25.722 --> 10:27.843
<i>now seems to have captured
the mood of a nation.</i>

10:27.844 --> 10:29.842
<i>We mourn seven heroes.</i>

10:29.843 --> 10:31.801
<i>We mourn their loss
as a nation together...</i>

10:31.802 --> 10:34.362
So, sir, are you something to do
with the enquiry there?

10:34.363 --> 10:36.804
Yeah, I'm on the presidential
commission.

10:36.805 --> 10:37.843
Ah.

10:37.844 --> 10:40.123
Alongside
some super-important people.

10:40.124 --> 10:45.242
<i>...slipped the surly bonds of Earth
to touch the face of God.</i>

10:45.243 --> 10:47.761
<i>Focus now turns to
the cause of the tragedy,</i>

10:47.762 --> 10:49.603
<i>as the Presidential Commission...</i>

10:49.604 --> 10:51.842
They gotta get back up there.

10:51.843 --> 10:53.563
Something went really wrong.

11:10.722 --> 11:12.682
Keep that. Thank you.

11:12.683 --> 11:14.322
Sir...

11:14.323 --> 11:16.962
Can I trouble you for an autograph?

11:16.963 --> 11:18.962
Sure.

11:18.963 --> 11:21.082
Who would I make it out to?

11:21.083 --> 11:22.802
Oh...

11:22.803 --> 11:25.441
Not you, sir.
I meant Mr Neil Armstrong.

11:25.442 --> 11:26.683
First man on the moon.

11:26.684 --> 11:28.682
You could mail it.

11:28.683 --> 11:30.883
That's my driver number,
at that address.

11:30.884 --> 11:32.802
OK.

11:32.803 --> 11:34.762
I promise. Thank you.

11:34.763 --> 11:36.123
Thank you.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.520
So what do you expect to find?

11:39.521 --> 11:41.722
Mr Feynman, what do
you expect to find?

11:46.522 --> 11:47.961
Pardon me.

11:47.962 --> 11:50.320
Mr Armstrong, I think we met...
Excuse me.

11:50.321 --> 11:53.563
I'm Bill Rogers.
I'm chairman of the Commission.

11:53.564 --> 11:56.482
We're very fortunate
to have you with us.

11:56.483 --> 11:59.203
Hey, I've got somebody
who wants to meet you.

11:59.204 --> 12:01.402
Dr Sally Ride.

12:01.403 --> 12:04.402
Oh... Our first woman in space.
Well...

12:04.403 --> 12:05.961
Nice to meet you.

12:05.962 --> 12:07.961
You too. Mmm.

12:07.962 --> 12:09.281
Good journey?

12:09.282 --> 12:11.561
I took the red-eye from LA.

12:11.562 --> 12:12.881
Don't ever do it.

12:12.882 --> 12:16.801
Dr Alton Keel,
our executive director.

12:16.802 --> 12:18.722
Nobel laureate, Richard Feynman.

12:18.723 --> 12:21.841
Your name I recognise too.
Fellow physicist.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.882
Formerly. I've been in Washington
several years. Oh.

12:26.402 --> 12:27.722
How's your integrity?

12:30.082 --> 12:31.921
That's just insulting. No!

12:31.922 --> 12:33.523
Don't take me seriously.

12:38.522 --> 12:40.401
Commissioners.

12:40.402 --> 12:44.241
I appreciate you all coming together
at short notice.

12:44.242 --> 12:47.321
We have a huge, vital task
ahead of us,

12:47.322 --> 12:49.160
upon which might depend the future

12:49.161 --> 12:51.362
of manned space flight
in this country.

12:52.602 --> 12:54.922
Now, I intend for this investigation

12:54.923 --> 12:58.481
to follow an orderly
and proper procedure.

12:58.482 --> 13:02.482
We are not going to conduct it
in a manner that is in any way

13:02.483 --> 13:04.680
unfairly critical of NASA.

13:04.681 --> 13:07.079
Because we believe,
and certainly I believe,

13:07.080 --> 13:09.521
that NASA has done an excellent job.

13:09.522 --> 13:13.441
And I believe that the American
people think so too.

13:13.442 --> 13:15.681
Anyone?

13:15.682 --> 13:19.001
We have to accept the fact
that this shuttle

13:19.002 --> 13:21.560
is the most complex machine
that's ever been built.

13:21.561 --> 13:24.322
I understand it has more than
two and a half million parts.

13:25.642 --> 13:27.960
It may be, after due consideration,

13:27.961 --> 13:30.602
it's just not possible
to identify the cause.

13:30.603 --> 13:31.681
Now...

13:31.682 --> 13:33.881
In terms of scheduling...
That's nothing.

13:35.361 --> 13:36.599
I'm sorry, Dr Feynman?

13:36.600 --> 13:38.601
Two and a half million -
small potatoes.

13:40.281 --> 13:44.400
No, really look - I don't know
much about space rockets,

13:44.401 --> 13:47.561
but I know a little something
about probability.

13:47.562 --> 13:51.881
Something I developed called, um...
path integral formulation.

13:54.882 --> 13:57.842
It's quantum mechanics, yuck, yuck.
But, um...

13:57.843 --> 14:03.640
Basically, what it means is that
you can figure out the probability

14:03.641 --> 14:05.840
of something occurring,

14:05.841 --> 14:09.480
not just when you get
two and a half million events,

14:09.481 --> 14:14.000
but an infinity of possibilities.

14:14.001 --> 14:17.200
However large
the number of causal paths

14:17.201 --> 14:20.320
for whatever happened to Challenger,

14:20.321 --> 14:22.281
an explanation can be found.

14:24.641 --> 14:27.721
What are we doing here if
we don't think it's possible?

14:28.921 --> 14:30.081
Right?

14:32.641 --> 14:36.240
Er... Chairman Rogers,
I headed an investigation

14:36.241 --> 14:38.159
into the failure of a Titan rocket,

14:38.160 --> 14:41.039
and I suggest I outline
the procedure we used there.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.201
I appreciate the offer,
General Kutyna,

14:43.202 --> 14:47.800
but I think in this case there's
far less collectable evidence.

14:47.801 --> 14:50.599
I don't like to contradict you, sir,
but in the case of the shuttle,

14:50.600 --> 14:52.079
as there are human beings aboard,

14:52.080 --> 14:54.039
it generates far more
database material.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.599
Mr Rogers, what the general
said is the case.

14:56.600 --> 14:59.319
There are external cameras,
there are black box recordings,

14:59.320 --> 15:02.198
there are telemetry sensors,
there's a great deal of information.

15:02.199 --> 15:03.880
Thank you, General Kutyna.

15:03.881 --> 15:05.079
And Mr Armstrong.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.599
I'm certain we can get back to this.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.879
Please, anyone.

15:08.880 --> 15:09.959
Chairman. Yes.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.639
I don't know about anyone else,
but, um...

15:12.640 --> 15:15.201
Coming in, I got
some major press attention.

15:16.481 --> 15:18.399
I'd like to know what we're to say.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.919
For the sake of
the astronaut families,

15:20.920 --> 15:23.119
what are we saying at this point?

15:23.120 --> 15:24.679
This is very important.

15:24.680 --> 15:26.759
Any and all enquiries from the press

15:26.760 --> 15:29.240
are to be directed
to Chairman Rogers's office.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.999
So, the plan is...

15:33.000 --> 15:35.319
lady and gentlemen...

15:35.320 --> 15:38.559
we will reconvene
in five days' time.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.160
But for the present,
enjoy your stay in Washington.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.200
What?

15:44.640 --> 15:46.360
We're not going to..? That's it.

15:46.361 --> 15:49.120
Keel. We don't start right away?

16:05.160 --> 16:06.400
Great.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.439
Dr Feynman.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.080
Bill Graham, head of NASA.

16:13.081 --> 16:14.799
Thank you.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.078
You're the guy that got me
into this.

16:17.079 --> 16:19.918
Well, I took your physics lectures
way back, never forgotten.

16:19.919 --> 16:23.438
I think you're going to bring
something unique to the Commission.

16:23.439 --> 16:27.597
I abandoned my teaching and a lot
of important consulting to come here,

16:27.598 --> 16:30.679
didn't imagine I was going to be told
to sit on my tush for a week.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.719
So, here's what I'm going to need.

16:35.720 --> 16:38.118
I'm going to need a crash course
in shuttle design.

16:38.119 --> 16:40.758
I need to know everything on
how this thing was put together,

16:40.759 --> 16:44.118
so if you can start supplying me with
the technical manuals and so forth,

16:44.119 --> 16:47.238
and most of all, you gotta get me
straight on the factory floor.

16:47.239 --> 16:48.718
Pretty new to NASA myself -

16:48.719 --> 16:50.800
I actually only took over
two months ago.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.359
That's bad timing.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.198
We're based here in Washington,

16:54.199 --> 16:55.758
but the shuttle engines and systems

16:55.759 --> 16:57.877
are all out of the Marshall
Space Flight Center.

16:57.878 --> 16:59.437
It pretty much takes care of itself.

16:59.438 --> 17:00.997
You're the head of the whole shmeer,

17:00.998 --> 17:02.917
I mean, you can get me
in this Marshall place,

17:02.918 --> 17:04.676
otherwise I'm a busy fella.

17:04.678 --> 17:07.398
I'll do my best.
I'll get on it right away.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.919
Right, thanks.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.400
I like that you didn't let up there
on the mighty chairman.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.198
You take it.
I don't care for limousines.

17:20.199 --> 17:21.278
Well, neither do I -

17:21.279 --> 17:24.240
I'm just a two-star general,
don't get assigned a limousine.

17:24.241 --> 17:25.678
Take the subway.

17:25.679 --> 17:27.958
Hmm.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.279
Pleasure. You too.

17:32.839 --> 17:33.999
Taxi!

17:37.679 --> 17:40.319
Oh, and there was a phone call
for you, sir.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.959
Please call your doctor.

17:44.759 --> 17:47.239
Dr... Weiss?

17:48.719 --> 17:50.959
The elevator's just
to your right, sir.

18:17.239 --> 18:20.157
<i>...to begin what may be
a lengthy process.</i>

18:20.158 --> 18:23.077
<i>Millions of Americans who watched
our heroes perish</i>

18:23.078 --> 18:26.556
<i>only 73 seconds after take-off
on that cold January morning</i>

18:26.557 --> 18:28.116
<i>are waiting for answers.</i>

18:28.117 --> 18:30.396
<i>Nancy and I are pained to the core
about the tragedy</i>

18:30.397 --> 18:32.279
<i>of the shuttle Challenger...</i>

18:32.280 --> 18:34.439
Hello.

18:35.519 --> 18:36.679
Graham.

18:38.199 --> 18:39.758
You got me in, great.

18:39.759 --> 18:43.318
I'll take a plane down
in the morning.

18:43.319 --> 18:45.038
Thanks.

18:45.039 --> 18:46.079
Alpha plus.

18:48.279 --> 18:52.357
<i>I've always had great faith in
and respect for our space programme.</i>

18:52.358 --> 18:54.438
<i>We don't hide our space programme.</i>

18:54.439 --> 18:57.637
<i>We don't keep secrets
and cover things up.</i>

18:57.638 --> 19:00.397
<i>We do it all upfront and in public.</i>

19:00.398 --> 19:04.078
<i>That's the way freedom is and
we wouldn't change it for a minute.</i>

19:15.799 --> 19:17.598
Wow, it's immense.

19:17.599 --> 19:19.157
This is an identical craft?

19:19.158 --> 19:20.837
No, it's a training simulator.

19:20.838 --> 19:25.518
but for your purposes, the flight
deck systems, the payload bay, etc,

19:25.519 --> 19:27.038
virtually identical.

19:34.278 --> 19:36.638
Want to see the flight deck?

19:58.438 --> 20:01.718
You have four human beings
jammed in this space?

20:01.719 --> 20:02.757
Can I sit here?

20:02.758 --> 20:03.798
Yeah.

20:06.118 --> 20:07.478
Wow.

20:09.238 --> 20:11.117
OK. So...

20:11.118 --> 20:13.997
they got S-Band
communication links...

20:13.998 --> 20:16.637
environmental control systems...

20:16.638 --> 20:18.518
cabin pressure gauges...

20:19.678 --> 20:21.876
What is that? Emergency oxygen.

20:21.877 --> 20:24.077
Don't touch things.

20:27.317 --> 20:28.357
Hmm.

20:32.638 --> 20:34.078
Come on.

20:39.718 --> 20:42.557
Dick Feynman. I'm on the Commission.

20:42.558 --> 20:44.158
I got nothing to hide.

20:49.198 --> 20:50.715
If I was to ask you engineers,

20:50.716 --> 20:53.435
never mind what the managers say,
but you guys...

20:53.436 --> 20:54.995
Given all your experience,

20:54.996 --> 20:59.835
what you thought the probability was
of an accident on any single launch,

20:59.836 --> 21:00.877
what would you say?

21:07.597 --> 21:09.315
I mean, if you don't want to say
out loud,

21:09.316 --> 21:11.477
perhaps you could write it down
on a piece of paper.

21:26.317 --> 21:29.437
So you're looking at the solid
rocket boosters.

21:29.438 --> 21:31.076
OK, so...

21:31.077 --> 21:33.236
They're not made here.

21:33.237 --> 21:37.236
No - they're made by contractors,
Morton Thiokol in Utah.

21:37.237 --> 21:38.915
Railroaded into Kennedy in sections.

21:38.916 --> 21:41.955
That's a pretty standard
tang and clevis joint.

21:41.956 --> 21:44.515
Look, there's no ways it
was the solid rocket boosters.

21:44.516 --> 21:47.754
How so certain? Because they don't
fly with holes in them.

21:47.755 --> 21:51.114
If it was the SRB, it would have
exploded on the launch pad.

21:51.115 --> 21:53.395
These kept on flying,
you see it in the footage.

21:53.396 --> 21:56.435
You watched the footage.
Tell me what you saw.

21:56.436 --> 21:58.035
What went through your mind?

21:58.036 --> 21:59.357
What did you think it was?

21:59.358 --> 22:01.876
I thought it was the main engines.

22:01.877 --> 22:03.996
OK. Why? Why the main engines?

22:03.997 --> 22:05.555
Because of the complexity.

22:05.556 --> 22:08.997
They're working at the outer edge
of any experience base.

22:08.998 --> 22:10.796
In the blade technology?

22:10.797 --> 22:12.797
No, no, no, it's more than
the blades, it's...

22:13.797 --> 22:14.836
Hey...

22:14.837 --> 22:17.996
There is no ways that I'm ratting
out my co-workers here.

22:17.997 --> 22:19.515
Look, pal...

22:19.516 --> 22:21.794
If we're not allowed to find out
what went wrong,

22:21.795 --> 22:23.874
there will be no more co-workers.

22:23.875 --> 22:26.036
All these jobs will be gone, kaput.

22:28.476 --> 22:30.396
Won't be another shuttle launch.

22:32.997 --> 22:35.795
<i>Of the events on the morning
of the 28th of January,</i>

22:35.796 --> 22:38.995
<i>the Presidential Commission
investigating the accident,</i>

22:38.996 --> 22:41.395
<i>headed by former
Secretary of State William Rogers,</i>

22:41.396 --> 22:43.237
<i>has met mostly behind closed doors.</i>

22:45.477 --> 22:48.474
<i>So far, it's given no hints
about what it believes</i>

22:48.475 --> 22:49.916
<i>may have been the cause.</i>

22:52.516 --> 22:54.274
<i>Meanwhile, off the coast
of Florida,</i>

22:54.275 --> 22:56.954
<i>the hunt for Challenger wreckage
continues.</i>

22:56.955 --> 22:59.594
<i>The combined NASA, naval
and coastguard operation</i>

22:59.595 --> 23:02.954
<i>involving 14 ships,
four submarines and 11 aircraft</i>

23:02.955 --> 23:05.114
<i>is combing hundreds of
square miles of ocean.</i>

23:05.115 --> 23:08.114
<i>Although NASA today released
pictures showing recovered debris,</i>

23:08.115 --> 23:11.394
<i>they've been unable to confirm that
they've found the crew compartment.</i>

23:11.395 --> 23:13.235
<i>In the absence of
detailed information</i>

23:13.236 --> 23:15.034
<i>about what happened to Challenger,</i>

23:15.035 --> 23:17.794
<i>speculation about the cause
of the accident continues to grow.</i>

23:17.795 --> 23:21.114
<i>Recent theories include everything
from a computer programming error</i>

23:21.115 --> 23:22.836
<i>to unusually strong winds.</i>

24:00.116 --> 24:01.556
Chairman Rogers...

24:02.516 --> 24:05.316
The boats just pulled in
the crew compartment.

24:08.276 --> 24:11.716
Can you tell me,
was the oxygen activated?

24:14.595 --> 24:16.114
Yes, Dr Ride.

24:16.115 --> 24:17.595
It was.

24:18.595 --> 24:19.954
We...

24:19.955 --> 24:22.835
maybe won't make that public
straight away.

24:23.955 --> 24:25.395
Excuse me.

24:41.756 --> 24:43.115
Dr Feynman.

24:44.195 --> 24:49.234
It's very important that this team
stays together all the time.

24:49.235 --> 24:50.395
Why?

24:51.755 --> 24:54.955
It's been reported to me that
you spent some time at Marshall.

24:54.956 --> 24:56.794
Alone.

24:56.795 --> 24:58.353
That's not very helpful.

24:58.354 --> 25:01.875
Oh, Mr Rogers, I don't find it
helpful to stand around.

25:02.875 --> 25:06.354
The other commissioners
are just being respectful.

25:06.355 --> 25:08.755
And you're saying I'm not?

25:10.715 --> 25:14.675
You understand the implications
of the oxygen being activated?

25:14.676 --> 25:16.154
I do.

25:16.155 --> 25:18.555
The astronauts
had to do that themselves.

25:19.795 --> 25:21.635
Which means that they were alive

25:21.636 --> 25:26.434
for at least some of those
two minutes and 36 seconds

25:26.435 --> 25:28.473
before they slammed into the ocean.

25:28.474 --> 25:29.633
Mr Rogers, I'm an atheist.

25:29.634 --> 25:32.113
I personally doubt that
they're touching the face of God,

25:32.114 --> 25:33.393
so I prefer to show my respect

25:33.394 --> 25:35.393
by finding the cause
of their appalling deaths

25:35.394 --> 25:37.075
and not stand around looking sad.

25:39.955 --> 25:42.232
You know, I didn't even want
to be on this commission

25:42.233 --> 25:43.312
but now that I'm on it,

25:43.313 --> 25:46.674
I've got every intention
of finding out what went wrong.

25:46.675 --> 25:52.035
You know, I don't know that NASA
did an excellent job.

26:01.675 --> 26:04.073
The group will be leaving
in 30 minutes.

26:04.074 --> 26:07.753
Except for General Kutyna,
who's made his own arrangements.

26:07.754 --> 26:09.794
I also may have my own arrangements.

26:12.234 --> 26:14.193
I can't force you to go.

26:14.194 --> 26:15.514
Nope.

26:33.995 --> 26:35.635
Are you going to work all night?

26:39.954 --> 26:43.433
Er... if necessary. I don't know.

26:43.434 --> 26:45.632
How do you plan to get back
to Washington?

26:45.633 --> 26:47.914
Er... I got myself in
kind of a pickle.

26:47.915 --> 26:50.593
I want to go back to Marshall.

26:50.594 --> 26:54.473
Guess I'll hire a car,
but it's hundreds of miles.

26:54.474 --> 26:56.794
I can give you a lift.
I'll drop you in Alabama.

26:56.795 --> 26:58.713
Oh.

26:58.714 --> 26:59.833
Thank you.

26:59.834 --> 27:01.154
Here. 0600?

27:02.154 --> 27:03.194
OK.

27:14.554 --> 27:15.712
I may not get a limo,

27:15.713 --> 27:18.154
but occasionally I get the use
of a government jet.

27:19.354 --> 27:22.594
No..! You imagined I was going
to drive you 400 miles?

27:22.595 --> 27:24.754
This is tremendous.

27:26.554 --> 27:28.033
New for you?

27:28.034 --> 27:30.194
You serious? No!

27:31.394 --> 27:34.033
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

27:34.034 --> 27:36.074
Oh!

27:37.033 --> 27:38.073
It's OK.

27:45.473 --> 27:47.351
You know, what you have to realise

27:47.352 --> 27:49.633
is that you are
uniquely independent.

27:51.553 --> 27:52.634
Yeah, how's that?

27:52.635 --> 27:53.673
Well...

27:53.674 --> 27:56.594
everyone on the commission
has strong associations.

27:58.034 --> 28:01.393
To whom?
Well, to NASA - Armstrong, Ride...

28:01.394 --> 28:04.434
The government - Keel -
Rogers was Secretary of State.

28:05.434 --> 28:08.513
And Bill Graham's even a personal
friend of President Reagan's.

28:08.514 --> 28:10.472
And you?

28:10.473 --> 28:11.513
Me, the Air Force.

28:12.593 --> 28:15.273
How does the Air Force...
Air Force three niner two six five.

28:15.274 --> 28:17.472
Low on four three zero.

28:17.473 --> 28:18.713
Heading three two zero.

28:20.313 --> 28:21.633
Two six five.

28:23.313 --> 28:25.993
How does the Air Force...
You're the only independent.

28:25.994 --> 28:28.032
I'm independent.

28:28.033 --> 28:29.552
I'm invincible.

28:29.553 --> 28:31.232
Yeah...

28:31.233 --> 28:32.673
but check six.

28:32.674 --> 28:34.472
What check six? That's, um...

28:34.473 --> 28:36.633
That's a fighter pilot's expression.

28:36.634 --> 28:38.312
Six o'clock.

28:38.313 --> 28:40.433
The blind spot. Directly behind you.

28:40.434 --> 28:41.473
Uh-huh.

28:43.673 --> 28:44.993
Watch my ass.

28:49.073 --> 28:50.912
OK, watch your ass here.

28:50.913 --> 28:52.673
What? It's a little steep.

29:16.073 --> 29:18.193
That's what we call the diamond.

29:18.194 --> 29:21.073
Wow, now that is very beautiful.

29:27.553 --> 29:29.792
What the hell?

29:29.793 --> 29:32.153
You happy with that,
with that vibration?

29:32.154 --> 29:35.312
Don't worry, it steadies again
after 65%.

29:37.912 --> 29:41.951
But to get to 65%,
you gotta go through that?

29:41.952 --> 29:43.632
Sometimes, yeah.

29:48.192 --> 29:51.592
Can I see components, the blades?

30:00.273 --> 30:01.833
Oh, what is that?

30:03.152 --> 30:05.592
It's a crack... in this blade.

30:07.192 --> 30:08.712
There's an obvious crack.

30:17.872 --> 30:19.391
Yeah.

30:19.392 --> 30:21.670
The blades often get those
after a flight,

30:21.671 --> 30:24.310
but that's not
a flight safety problem.

30:24.311 --> 30:27.590
Well, what is it, then? We were told
to log it as a maintenance problem.

30:27.591 --> 30:31.390
Only if it develops into a full
fracture, THAT would be a failure.

30:31.391 --> 30:34.232
So a failure only happens
if it actually shears off?

30:34.233 --> 30:35.272
Uh-huh.

30:36.712 --> 30:40.071
Bull! The failure is the crack.

30:40.072 --> 30:41.670
Well, you could argue that...

30:41.671 --> 30:44.990
The failure is the crack - I mean,
because it's not in the design.

30:44.991 --> 30:47.592
You know and I know
it's not supposed to crack.

30:51.992 --> 30:53.872
Who has the rest of the test data?

30:57.552 --> 30:58.912
Is that it?

31:57.232 --> 32:02.750
I think we should start this discussion
on the step-by-step process, so...

32:02.751 --> 32:06.470
Concentrate the investigation
on the main engines.

32:06.471 --> 32:09.390
There are cracked turbine blades.

32:09.391 --> 32:12.991
As early as 1,375 seconds,
equivalent to full power level.

32:12.992 --> 32:16.950
Also, at 4,000 hertz,
there are some nasty vibrations.

32:16.951 --> 32:19.909
So you think the cause lies
within the engines?

32:19.910 --> 32:22.709
I'd bet my last dime on it.
I just got back from Marshall.

32:22.710 --> 32:26.149
I just heard an interesting new
definition of the word "failure".

32:26.150 --> 32:28.910
Well, it's interesting that
you should say that, Doctor.

32:28.911 --> 32:33.310
We've just received
the telemetry data from NASA,

32:33.311 --> 32:35.470
and the sensors on the engines

32:35.471 --> 32:38.990
show that they performed
absolutely perfectly.

32:38.991 --> 32:41.030
Get out of here!

32:41.031 --> 32:46.230
The engines began to shut down
as fuel pressure decreased,

32:46.231 --> 32:47.791
exactly as designed.

32:48.791 --> 32:53.951
That's extremely lucky, because I'm telling
you, those engines have profound problems.

32:53.952 --> 32:57.521
Now there is a step-by-step process
for us all to follow,

32:58.386 --> 33:01.912
and I respectfully request
that from now on...

33:02.368 --> 33:04.418
you abide by it.

33:04.830 --> 33:07.630
We're all trying to find the answer.

33:09.790 --> 33:12.311
All right, we begin.

33:15.511 --> 33:17.151
Step by step.

33:18.911 --> 33:20.351
Crap.

33:25.431 --> 33:26.550
Prof...

33:29.270 --> 33:31.270
Don't let the chairman put you off.

33:33.150 --> 33:37.948
Look, you should come by the house
some night for a bite, if that appeals.

33:37.949 --> 33:40.510
Yeah? OK, good.
Excuse me for a second.

33:40.511 --> 33:42.189
Listen...

33:42.190 --> 33:46.510
Graham, why didn't I know that we had
the results from the sensors on the engines?

33:47.670 --> 33:50.788
Is NASA drip-feeding us
information to suit itself?

33:50.789 --> 33:53.991
I hear you. I'm doing this
with one hand tied behind my back.

33:53.992 --> 33:57.029
I hear you, but..

33:57.030 --> 34:00.230
Richard...?

34:03.350 --> 34:04.510
You OK?

34:11.469 --> 34:13.150
I'll see you tomorrow.

34:26.389 --> 34:31.708
I goofed. I thought I had the answer.
I was way off.

34:31.708 --> 34:36.029
<i>So what are you going to do?
Are you going to stick with it?</i>

34:36.030 --> 34:37.710
I don't know.

34:39.909 --> 34:43.750
Listen, there's a knock on the door.
I'll call you later. 'All right. '

35:13.910 --> 35:17.830
I'm not sure why they chose to
just lay them in this order.

35:17.831 --> 35:19.709
It's difficult to tell,

35:19.710 --> 35:22.310
but this is... this is half that...

35:23.389 --> 35:24.709
Chairman Rogers...

35:26.589 --> 35:31.468
NASA's Failure Analysis team
supplied a still from camera E207,

35:31.469 --> 35:33.069
trained on-flight.

35:37.629 --> 35:40.549
It looks like it took a long time
for this photograph to appear.

35:40.550 --> 35:43.269
Well, it's here now.
What is that?

35:46.549 --> 35:48.268
A flame?

35:48.269 --> 35:51.746
Coming from a position on the side
of the solid rocket booster?

35:51.747 --> 35:54.149
Did we know that?
Did we know that already?

35:59.789 --> 36:03.668
Did we get stills from other angles?
Am I right?

36:03.669 --> 36:06.107
They had cameras all around?
Yeah. Yes.

36:06.108 --> 36:09.867
Some of the cameras that were
looking directly at the area

36:09.868 --> 36:11.989
were not working on the day,
I'm told.

36:18.229 --> 36:21.548
Well, that's unfortunate. Hm.

36:25.708 --> 36:27.708
May I have that, please? Of course.

36:44.429 --> 36:47.549
Am I super-late?
I had to pick this up at the lab.

36:47.550 --> 36:50.267
No, no, it's not a problem.
Nice car.

36:50.268 --> 36:52.868
You like it? Like it? I LOVE it.

36:54.108 --> 36:57.668
I don't know if that enlargement's
going to tell us anything.

36:57.669 --> 37:00.067
Let's see.

37:00.068 --> 37:03.626
Well, it's somewhat clearer, no? No, that
just makes the whole thing wider open.

37:03.627 --> 37:06.586
But the flamer is sharper. But
that flame, where is it originating?

37:06.587 --> 37:08.866
Perhaps what we're seeing
is the tip of a larger flame

37:08.867 --> 37:11.308
on the other side where there's
no damned camera.

37:12.909 --> 37:16.909
A flame is not a cause. A flame is
an effect, it's a symptom.

37:16.910 --> 37:20.867
That doesn't tell us
which component split,

37:20.868 --> 37:23.348
sheared off, cracked.
It shows us nothing.

37:25.268 --> 37:26.668
It takes us nowhere.

37:28.428 --> 37:29.986
I want to show you something.

37:29.987 --> 37:32.786
Multiple successful launches,
identical components

37:32.787 --> 37:36.348
and launch locations,
so what made that day special?

37:36.349 --> 37:38.707
What were the variables?

37:38.708 --> 37:39.828
Take a break, Prof.

37:48.387 --> 37:50.787
Oh!

37:53.108 --> 37:55.467
You lucky fella!

37:55.468 --> 37:59.106
Yeah, I'd be luckier if I could get
it running. It's out of commission.

37:59.107 --> 38:01.428
The carburettors seize
in this weather.

38:06.148 --> 38:07.948
This must be how you stay calm.

38:09.268 --> 38:13.628
Roger The Dodger's got me going
crazy with that process of his.

38:15.308 --> 38:18.705
He's a lawyer. He's working it
through the way he knows.

38:18.706 --> 38:22.625
Yeah, well, maybe some others are kind
of working it through the way they know.

38:22.626 --> 38:25.547
What? You think somebody's
working it for themselves?

38:25.548 --> 38:29.186
Do you? It's Washington, after all.

38:29.187 --> 38:34.427
I can't believe I got myself back in
this world - government, politics...

38:34.428 --> 38:37.067
And military guys like me.

38:37.068 --> 38:39.428
You're surprisingly OK.

38:41.028 --> 38:44.748
I guess you had your fill of
military personnel through the '40s.

38:50.027 --> 38:51.427
What was your role back then?

38:54.307 --> 38:57.747
When?
During the war, with the A-bomb.

39:02.587 --> 39:07.267
I did the theoretical figuring.
It was the math.

39:08.707 --> 39:11.525
I calculated how much
fissionable material would

39:11.895 --> 39:14.468
be necessary to make
an effective weapon.

39:17.627 --> 39:19.347
It's not a good use of science.

39:26.827 --> 39:28.747
You helped end the war.

39:32.347 --> 39:34.827
Wow, this is beautiful!

39:36.627 --> 39:38.265
Shall we try that Bordeaux?

39:38.266 --> 39:41.547
You go ahead. I no longer drink.
If I drink, I can't think.

39:52.187 --> 39:55.385
Oh, sir, we had maintenance
look at your heating.

39:55.386 --> 39:58.467
Oh, thank you. Let me know
if you still feel chilly.

40:07.387 --> 40:11.147
Could you help me find the number
of the National Weather Service?

40:16.866 --> 40:18.145
There you go.

40:18.146 --> 40:20.106
Can I borrow this? Sure.

40:21.146 --> 40:24.585
Yeah, please. Not a forecast.

40:24.586 --> 40:28.825
The temperature at Cape Canaveral.
Nearby?

40:28.826 --> 40:33.427
Yeah, Jacksonville, Florida, on
the morning of the 28th of January.

40:40.667 --> 40:41.707
Thank you.

40:52.586 --> 40:54.466
That's the variable.

40:57.066 --> 40:58.825
I got the variable.

40:58.826 --> 41:01.944
It was freezing cold on the morning
of the launch. We need to focus

41:01.945 --> 41:05.904
our questioning of the NASA managers
on stuff to do with temperature.

41:05.905 --> 41:07.824
Temperature?
You're talking about ice?

41:07.825 --> 41:10.904
I don't know. Perhaps added weight of ice,
perhaps some metal component

41:10.905 --> 41:13.184
becoming brittle.
I don't know which component.

41:13.185 --> 41:15.704
There are only two and a half
million possibilities!

41:15.705 --> 41:16.984
I'm pretty certain.

41:16.985 --> 41:19.146
As certain as
you were about the engines?

41:27.706 --> 41:31.026
Anything from NASA Failure Analysis?
Due this afternoon.

41:34.226 --> 41:36.706
Dr Feynman's becoming
a real pain in the ass. >

41:38.346 --> 41:39.826
Well, yeah.

41:43.625 --> 41:44.745
You betcha.

42:31.025 --> 42:33.546
Dr Weiss? Dick.

42:36.586 --> 42:37.986
What are you doing here?

42:39.026 --> 42:41.583
Well, if the mountain won't go
to Muhammad...

42:41.584 --> 42:43.383
You didn't answer my calls.

42:43.384 --> 42:45.863
So you tracked me down
all the way across the country?!

42:45.864 --> 42:48.785
Nah, nah, nah. I'm at Washington
Hospital Center for a conference.

42:48.786 --> 42:51.504
You got an hour to come over there?

42:51.505 --> 42:54.265
Now? Yeah.

42:55.785 --> 42:57.225
Sure. Hold on.

42:58.585 --> 43:02.617
Um... I need to get
this delivered to Dr Keel,

43:03.012 --> 43:05.483
Presidential Commission -
this address.

43:06.065 --> 43:08.302
It's extremely important
that it gets there.

43:08.303 --> 43:09.624
Yes, sir. Thank you.

43:13.505 --> 43:14.545
Good to see you!

43:28.185 --> 43:31.424
With a vengeance? Mm-hm.

43:31.425 --> 43:33.905
It's compromising
your remaining kidney.

43:37.225 --> 43:39.664
Show me the cells. It's here.

43:51.184 --> 43:54.105
OK. That is not so pretty.

43:55.785 --> 43:58.385
I read up on my chances
if my sarcoma recurred.

43:59.585 --> 44:02.063
What's the deal
if we add in this lymphoma?

44:02.064 --> 44:04.745
It's pretty difficult
to calculate the combined...

44:04.746 --> 44:07.383
Don't weasel it, Doc. It's math.

44:07.384 --> 44:09.664
Look, Dick,
it's not something we see.

44:09.665 --> 44:12.743
The particular cancers you have,
they're...

44:12.744 --> 44:17.503
they're extremely rare. The chance
of having them in conjunction...

44:17.504 --> 44:19.824
Well, given what you were
doing during the war...

44:19.825 --> 44:21.224
If it even matters.

44:24.464 --> 44:28.784
What do you think? Well, the radiation -
what safety precautions were there?

44:28.785 --> 44:30.184
For the test, I...

44:31.224 --> 44:34.665
For the test I had a pair of dark
glasses, which I never put on.

44:35.904 --> 44:38.624
Jeez, they were...
they were crazy days.

44:40.944 --> 44:42.943
We never slept.

44:42.944 --> 44:46.862
We were on fire, you know,
getting the theory and the math

44:46.863 --> 44:50.502
and the physics. It was a race. We
thought we were saving civilisation,

44:50.503 --> 44:54.862
but then we found out the Germans
didn't have nuclear capability

44:54.863 --> 44:57.784
and we kept on.
The science was... so exciting.

45:06.263 --> 45:07.503
Should have stopped.

45:09.543 --> 45:13.864
We threw a party. While people
struggled and died, we threw a party.

45:14.904 --> 45:17.103
Hey, you were young.

45:17.104 --> 45:18.144
I wasn't a child.

45:19.184 --> 45:20.624
Yeah.

45:25.704 --> 45:26.744
OK.

45:32.824 --> 45:35.023
I guess we'll talk on the phone.
Sure.

45:37.703 --> 45:40.183
I think there are probably
worse ways to go.

45:42.423 --> 45:44.302
Hey, your hands are cold.

45:44.303 --> 45:45.823
All the time. What is that?

45:47.783 --> 45:49.223
It's possibly lymphoma.

45:50.263 --> 45:53.662
The blood gets gummy.
Capillaries lose their flexibility -

45:53.663 --> 45:54.784
they can't expand.

45:56.184 --> 45:57.224
Thanks.

46:01.424 --> 46:04.143
Yeah, just talk to me about
components that are flexible.

46:05.663 --> 46:07.943
What about a solid rocket booster?

46:10.143 --> 46:11.263
Go ahead.

46:16.703 --> 46:18.222
Thank you, Louis.

46:18.223 --> 46:21.862
Hey, I thought
this might be helpful.

46:21.863 --> 46:23.903
It's a section model
of the SRB joint.

46:25.423 --> 46:28.183
I don't want to see a model.
I want to see the real thing.

46:38.343 --> 46:40.542
So there are two O-rings

46:40.543 --> 46:42.902
and they squidge in here?

46:42.903 --> 46:44.342
Correct.

46:44.343 --> 46:47.143
Has there ever been
a history of problems with them?

46:47.144 --> 46:51.062
Well, there has been some erosion,
even some blow-by.

46:51.063 --> 46:52.502
"Blow-by" is what?

46:52.503 --> 46:54.861
Soot getting past the first O-ring.

46:54.862 --> 46:57.901
That would mean that
the seal is incomplete?

46:57.902 --> 47:00.621
Right, but the manufacturer
said that... Morton Thiokol?

47:00.622 --> 47:04.940
Right, Thiokol said that the blow-by
never got past the second O-ring, never.

47:04.941 --> 47:08.942
But if something prevented
the O-ring from doing its job...

47:10.462 --> 47:15.663
...if it became rigid because,
for example, it was cold...?

47:25.983 --> 47:29.702
I think what we're looking at
is the O-rings

47:29.703 --> 47:31.821
within the seal of the SRB.

47:31.822 --> 47:34.860
Lower temperatures would
diminish the flexibility.

47:34.861 --> 47:37.020
Rubber would get harder,
less malleable.

47:37.021 --> 47:40.382
At a certain point it would be
too rigid to move into the gap.

47:42.142 --> 47:43.661
Bill...

47:43.662 --> 47:48.301
I need any data NASA have
on the timings of spring-back.

47:48.302 --> 47:54.302
Resilience of the SRB O-rings
in response to temperature.

47:54.303 --> 47:56.103
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

47:56.104 --> 47:59.581
Just a reminder that we have
many witnesses today

47:59.582 --> 48:01.822
and the press will be in the room.

48:03.542 --> 48:06.942
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like
to call the commission to order,

48:06.943 --> 48:11.942
so please take your seats,
make yourselves comfortable.

48:13.702 --> 48:15.622
Pilot to co-pilot, fix your hair.

48:17.022 --> 48:19.741
Our first witness is Mr Mulloy.

48:19.742 --> 48:24.020
Mr Mulloy, would you come forward
and identify yourself, please?

48:24.021 --> 48:25.420
I am Lawrence Mulloy.

48:25.421 --> 48:28.260
Solid rocket booster project manager
for NASA

48:28.261 --> 48:30.661
at the Marshall Space Flight Center.

48:30.662 --> 48:33.062
All right. Commissioners? Anyone?

48:36.582 --> 48:38.022
Dr Ride?

48:39.822 --> 48:41.421
Mr Mulloy...

48:41.422 --> 48:45.022
in your position
at the Marshall Space Flight Center,

48:45.023 --> 48:48.782
you'd be aware of
correspondence, memos, etc?

48:51.062 --> 48:53.982
I guess I'm wondering
whether memos exist relating

48:53.983 --> 48:59.540
to problems of launching with
O - rings at low temperatures.

48:59.541 --> 49:03.259
I understand the morning of the
launch was exceptionally cold.

49:03.260 --> 49:05.421
I'm not aware of such documents
at Marshall.

49:08.141 --> 49:11.902
It's not correspondence, but
on the evening before the launch,

49:11.903 --> 49:16.941
as a matter of routine, those of us
from NASA asked our technical people

49:16.942 --> 49:21.822
and our contractors if there were
any concerns about low temperature.

49:22.982 --> 49:26.819
Morton Thiokol, who make the solid
rocket boosters, presented us

49:26.820 --> 49:28.941
with the fact
that the lowest temperature

49:28.942 --> 49:32.860
we had ever flown an O-ring
was 53 degrees,

49:32.861 --> 49:38.059
and they wanted to point out that we
would be outside of that experience base.

49:38.060 --> 49:42.419
But having heard the discussion,
we... we all concluded that there

49:42.420 --> 49:46.099
was no problem with the predicted
temperatures, and I have

49:46.100 --> 49:49.021
a document from the management
of Morton Thiokol to that effect.

49:50.781 --> 49:52.620
Thank you. Thank you, Mr Mulloy.

49:52.621 --> 49:54.622
You may stand down,
for the time being.

49:54.623 --> 49:58.620
There's some guy in the back
who wants to say something.

49:58.621 --> 50:00.260
I have something to add.

50:00.261 --> 50:03.379
I beg your pardon? I... I need to add
to what he said, please.

50:03.380 --> 50:06.821
All right, sir. Please, step forward,
step forward. Identify yourself.

50:15.021 --> 50:19.900
My name is Allan McDonald.
I work for Morton Thiokol.

50:19.901 --> 50:22.901
I'm the director
of the solid rocket motors project,

50:22.902 --> 50:26.139
so I was at the launch at Kennedy.

50:26.140 --> 50:28.178
I'd like to say something
about the meeting

50:28.179 --> 50:31.500
the night before the launch
that Mr Mulloy talked about.

50:33.501 --> 50:37.541
Our Thiokol engineers... warned NASA.

50:40.381 --> 50:44.100
They recommended NASA not to launch
below 53 degrees

50:44.101 --> 50:45.261
and I agreed with them.

50:45.262 --> 50:48.740
That was the coldest
that we knew was safe.

50:48.741 --> 50:53.700
So you said not to launch
below 53 degrees?

50:53.701 --> 50:55.900
And what was the actual
temperature that morning?

50:57.060 --> 51:01.299
We believed that, at launch,
it was going to be much colder.

51:01.300 --> 51:04.780
Below 32 degrees, below freezing.

51:07.060 --> 51:08.820
NASA wasn't happy with that.

51:08.821 --> 51:13.020
Larry Mulloy said, "My God, Thiokol!

51:13.021 --> 51:15.301
"When do we launch? April?!"

51:17.741 --> 51:19.862
Let me understand this...
now...

51:22.035 --> 51:24.834
are you saying
that NASA applied pressure

51:25.312 --> 51:28.100
to change the launch
recommendation?

51:29.180 --> 51:33.138
Yes, sir, there was pressure.
They said, "Go review the data. "

51:33.139 --> 51:37.540
Our people in Utah came back,
and recommended to NASA to launch.

51:38.820 --> 51:40.580
I refused to sign.

51:45.020 --> 51:47.419
It is important that NASA be given

51:47.420 --> 51:51.140
the-the opportunity to respond
to what's just been alleged.

51:51.141 --> 51:52.659
We must allow...

51:52.660 --> 51:54.460
What the hell is going on here?

52:01.580 --> 52:03.898
Some people say
McDonald's doing a CYA.

52:03.899 --> 52:06.538
"CYA". What is that?
That stands for "cover your ass".

52:06.539 --> 52:09.698
But if they were warned...
The astronauts sure weren't.

52:09.699 --> 52:12.298
I want to know what's happening
right here between NASA

52:12.299 --> 52:14.660
and the contractors.
We need to talk more to HIM.

52:14.661 --> 52:17.819
Richard. Richard,
the data you wanted

52:17.820 --> 52:19.898
on the resistance timings
of the O-rings...

52:19.899 --> 52:23.779
OK, thanks. We need to hear more from him.
Can you stop Mr McDonald from...?

52:24.979 --> 52:26.499
Damn.

53:01.339 --> 53:06.619
Hi. I need to contact Allan McDonald with
NASA's Challenger Failure Analysis team.

53:06.620 --> 53:10.978
I phoned, but I was told
he's no longer in Washington.

53:10.979 --> 53:12.660
That information is restricted.

53:15.180 --> 53:17.778
He was on the team
but he's been removed?

53:17.779 --> 53:18.980
I can't answer that, sir.

53:25.659 --> 53:29.818
Look, all I want to do is speak
to Allan McDonald. What?!

53:29.819 --> 53:34.737
So there's no-one I can talk to in
the whole entirety of Morton Thiokol?

53:34.738 --> 53:37.179
There's no-one
who can answer my question?

53:39.179 --> 53:40.579
Well, have a nice day!

54:19.658 --> 54:22.737
General...

54:22.738 --> 54:25.497
I tried to find McDonald.

54:25.498 --> 54:29.178
No luck, and it's clear why
his bosses wanted to please NASA -

54:29.179 --> 54:31.697
very big money at stake.

54:31.698 --> 54:33.379
I'll catch you later.

54:43.779 --> 54:45.418
Hey, Graham.

54:45.419 --> 54:49.937
That spring-back on the O-ring
was measured over two hours.

54:49.938 --> 54:51.937
It's useless information.

54:51.938 --> 54:54.176
I'm really sorry.
That's what I got from Marshall.

54:54.177 --> 54:57.576
Remember what it was to be a scientist
before government got to you?

54:57.577 --> 55:00.418
You don't think I gave you...?
On purpose...?

55:01.458 --> 55:02.937
No.

55:02.938 --> 55:06.137
Look, I have this grand title.

55:06.138 --> 55:09.736
The NASA old guard, they handed me a list
of who should be on the commission.

55:09.737 --> 55:12.059
It was tough to persuade them
to take you.

55:13.499 --> 55:16.857
I'm sorry to have gotten you
into this.

55:16.858 --> 55:18.845
Well, when you read
my notes that I sent,

55:19.218 --> 55:21.535
you'll see the crap that
goes down at Marshall.

55:22.151 --> 55:26.017
Notes?
My write-ups.

55:26.018 --> 55:29.818
Those analyses and my examination
of the crazy engineering.

55:37.098 --> 55:38.658
Richard. Richard...

55:42.058 --> 55:47.537
Sally, did you get a set of notes,
my observations?

55:49.097 --> 55:51.417
No, I haven't had anything.

56:03.618 --> 56:05.538
What the hell happened to my notes?

56:06.738 --> 56:09.938
Sally Ride says she didn't get them.
Did the others?

56:14.817 --> 56:18.216
OK. I had sent over from my hotel

56:18.217 --> 56:21.215
a stack of typed-up notes,
wrapped in brown paper,

56:21.216 --> 56:24.529
proper analyses of all my observations
of the engineering so far, with a request

56:24.946 --> 56:27.860
for you to have copies made for each
commissioner. I have no knowledge of this.

56:28.456 --> 56:31.695
No such notes ever arrived on this desk.
Perhaps you can have them redone?

56:31.696 --> 56:33.016
I don't have time for this!

56:33.017 --> 56:36.338
You trusted your hotel
to deliver something so important?

56:37.818 --> 56:39.977
Yeah.

56:39.978 --> 56:42.737
Dr Feynman, please, as you can see,

56:42.738 --> 56:47.017
NASA is now co-operating fully with
all of our requests for information.

56:56.297 --> 56:58.375
Well, then,
have copies made of everything

56:58.376 --> 57:00.017
and have it sent over to my hotel.

57:07.577 --> 57:09.615
I don't know what's going on, honey.

57:09.616 --> 57:12.857
I landed myself right back
in a load of political crap.

57:14.177 --> 57:17.937
People seem to know a lot more
than what they're saying. 'Yeah?'

57:19.617 --> 57:22.217
And I finally got
a ton of stuff from NASA.

57:23.537 --> 57:27.896
It's full of anomalies.
How can that be critical one moment

57:27.897 --> 57:29.537
and safe to operate the next?

57:32.177 --> 57:35.777
Honey, I'm sorry.
It's best for me to call you later.

57:37.137 --> 57:39.576
<i>- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.</i>

57:39.577 --> 57:41.975
<i>Honestly?</i>

57:41.976 --> 57:44.495
No, I feel very well.

57:44.496 --> 57:47.575
<i>Oh, all right. Speak tomorrow.</i>

57:47.576 --> 57:49.056
Yeah.

57:58.257 --> 58:00.137
"Ivory soap. "

58:02.537 --> 58:04.737
"Ivory soap. "

58:40.656 --> 58:42.495
General.

58:42.496 --> 58:46.214
OK, look, this is driving me crazy.
I got a room full of NASA bullshit

58:46.215 --> 58:49.376
that just makes me more sure certain
what caused the explosion.

58:49.377 --> 58:53.135
The cold, OK?
We've got a guy who agrees with us.

58:53.136 --> 58:54.934
He gets shoved off the enquiry.

58:54.935 --> 58:57.296
We both know why,
but none of it answers.

58:58.296 --> 59:00.936
There's a logic thing here
that I'm just not getting.

59:00.937 --> 59:04.255
It's about
what is at the heart of this thing.

59:04.256 --> 59:08.135
Why did NASA need to launch so bad?

59:08.136 --> 59:10.855
OK, stop, Prof,
I can't answer this here.

59:12.136 --> 59:16.895
Erm... I'll pick you up
in the morning. 8:15.

59:16.896 --> 59:20.335
And bring full ID. OK?

59:20.336 --> 59:22.176
Goodnight. Goodnight.

59:27.376 --> 59:28.936
Where are we going?

59:44.655 --> 59:46.655
We're going to the Pentagon?

59:54.256 --> 59:55.656
ID, please.

59:58.256 --> 01:00:00.176
Sir.

01:00:25.815 --> 01:00:28.375
Thank you, sergeant.
Stand by outside.

01:00:28.376 --> 01:00:32.656
Prof, why don't you
grab a seat down here?

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:34.936
Right there.

01:00:41.215 --> 01:00:44.894
NASA. The agency of
the United States Government

01:00:44.895 --> 01:00:47.813
responsible for the nation's
civilian space programme

01:00:47.814 --> 01:00:50.095
and for aeronautics
and aerospace research.

01:00:50.096 --> 01:00:54.294
Note the word "civilian" in there.

01:00:54.295 --> 01:00:58.013
The project cost in US dollars
of running the space programme...

01:00:58.014 --> 01:00:59.575
The actual cost, I get it.

01:00:59.576 --> 01:01:04.134
And knowing this is unsustainable,
NASA needs to prove itself,

01:01:04.135 --> 01:01:05.612
needs to bolster its purpose,

01:01:05.613 --> 01:01:09.052
over and above civilian scientific
research and discovery, OK.

01:01:09.053 --> 01:01:10.574
So park that for a moment.

01:01:12.135 --> 01:01:16.014
The Air Force, meanwhile,
wants to upgrade Titan.

01:01:16.015 --> 01:01:20.415
An efficient fleet of unmanned rockets
to deploy spy satellites into space.

01:01:20.416 --> 01:01:22.014
Paranoia. OK.

01:01:22.015 --> 01:01:25.333
Whatever you civilians are told,
we are still deep in the Cold War.

01:01:25.334 --> 01:01:27.295
What's it got to do with NASA?

01:01:27.296 --> 01:01:29.894
NASA approaches Congress
with a deal.

01:01:29.895 --> 01:01:31.733
That seems to make
great economic sense,

01:01:31.734 --> 01:01:35.014
the government can stop funding
Titan and instead divert

01:01:35.015 --> 01:01:39.853
the money to NASA, and the Shuttle
becomes sole access into space.

01:01:39.854 --> 01:01:43.174
NASA knocks out the Air Force
and gets a funding boost.

01:01:43.175 --> 01:01:44.494
Exactly. Yeah.

01:01:45.694 --> 01:01:48.454
And the Shuttle
secures its raison d'etre.

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:50.573
Carrying spy satellites?

01:01:50.574 --> 01:01:52.974
And NASA convinced Congress

01:01:52.975 --> 01:01:58.694
that by 1986 they'd be able to
launch twice a month, every month,

01:01:58.695 --> 01:02:01.134
and on each of these flights,

01:02:01.135 --> 01:02:04.694
payload will be made available
to the Department of Defense.

01:02:08.654 --> 01:02:10.773
Titan was my project.

01:02:10.774 --> 01:02:14.093
But NASA reneges on its obligation

01:02:14.094 --> 01:02:18.014
and instead of giving DoD priority,
they started taking Senators

01:02:18.015 --> 01:02:22.773
up there, in... just
PR stunt after PR stunt.

01:02:22.774 --> 01:02:25.052
And then,
launches start getting cancelled.

01:02:25.053 --> 01:02:26.772
The press is beginning to notice...

01:02:26.773 --> 01:02:28.252
Congress is getting jumpy.

01:02:28.253 --> 01:02:31.252
Yeah, yeah, and the administration
is asking questions.

01:02:31.253 --> 01:02:35.092
And then last December,
the launch is delayed six times,

01:02:35.093 --> 01:02:38.012
and remember NASA had promised
Congress launch at any time,

01:02:38.013 --> 01:02:41.174
under any conditions,
and then January 28th...

01:02:43.974 --> 01:02:46.854
January 28th launch, it's cold...

01:02:48.814 --> 01:02:50.574
It's very cold...

01:02:51.854 --> 01:02:54.134
...and NASA feels
under extreme pressure.

01:02:56.534 --> 01:02:57.774
And took the risk.

01:02:59.214 --> 01:03:00.534
They took the risk.

01:03:03.773 --> 01:03:05.613
Why did you tell me all this?

01:03:07.613 --> 01:03:10.052
Do you wish you didn't know?

01:03:10.053 --> 01:03:13.574
Downstairs, you made me sign
the classified information thing.

01:03:13.575 --> 01:03:14.774
That's right.

01:03:16.294 --> 01:03:19.653
So what's going on, Kutyna?

01:03:19.654 --> 01:03:21.452
I mean, you got me trapped,

01:03:21.453 --> 01:03:23.174
I can't spill any of this crap.

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:27.892
It would jeopardise national
security, the Soviets would know.

01:03:27.893 --> 01:03:30.534
You guys can't launch
a damned thing in cold weather.

01:03:34.093 --> 01:03:37.411
You've been playing me
the whole time. From the beginning.

01:03:37.412 --> 01:03:39.413
That weird thing in the garage.

01:03:39.414 --> 01:03:44.572
With the carburettor,
the carburettor and the cold,

01:03:44.573 --> 01:03:47.573
I was supposed to take a hint. What
is this, some kind of game to you?

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:49.852
No, but it was a nudge.

01:03:49.853 --> 01:03:52.892
I heard about the O-ring
via an astronaut friend of mine

01:03:52.893 --> 01:03:55.852
who was tipped off, in secret,
by a NASA engineer.

01:03:55.853 --> 01:03:58.372
This astronaut's career
has to be protected.

01:03:58.373 --> 01:04:00.771
I had to let you get there
on your own, Prof.

01:04:00.772 --> 01:04:04.331
Prof. Don't Prof me, you don't play
me, you don't screw around with me.

01:04:04.332 --> 01:04:07.411
Listen to me and you'll understand
why I'm telling you this.

01:04:07.412 --> 01:04:10.451
I can't do anything with it!
That's the point!

01:04:10.452 --> 01:04:13.131
Don't ever tell me anything
I can't open my mouth

01:04:13.132 --> 01:04:14.733
and blab to the whole world!

01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:20.892
I got to... I gotta get out of here.

01:04:20.893 --> 01:04:22.453
Listen...

01:04:26.253 --> 01:04:28.172
Richard...

01:04:28.173 --> 01:04:30.970
No-one plays me.
What is this, check six?

01:04:30.971 --> 01:04:35.251
Remember, I told you that only you
are independent on this commission.

01:04:35.252 --> 01:04:37.053
Do others on the commission...

01:04:39.093 --> 01:04:40.293
Do they know stuff?

01:04:40.294 --> 01:04:42.812
Everyone knows some, or all,

01:04:42.813 --> 01:04:45.411
but they're all bound.
This is Washington.

01:04:45.412 --> 01:04:48.171
What can be acknowledged,
how, by whom...

01:04:48.172 --> 01:04:49.531
You go drag me into this?

01:04:49.532 --> 01:04:53.851
No, it's absolutely not, you're
coming at it completely differently.

01:04:53.852 --> 01:04:55.651
I told you, because I believe

01:04:55.652 --> 01:04:58.372
that you, and only you,
can use what you have,

01:04:58.373 --> 01:05:02.051
you can use the science
to cut through the bullshit,

01:05:02.052 --> 01:05:06.131
to ensure that the real reason
for those deaths gets out.

01:05:06.132 --> 01:05:09.691
That it's made completely
clear to the public.

01:05:09.692 --> 01:05:12.453
NASA's forced to admit it,
and has to reform.

01:05:13.973 --> 01:05:15.893
I wish.

01:05:16.933 --> 01:05:20.171
Why can't people just say things
the way they are?

01:05:20.172 --> 01:05:24.451
Cos it's politics, it's dirty, but
you can, you can drive through that.

01:05:24.452 --> 01:05:26.771
You can... What's the, what's the...

01:05:26.772 --> 01:05:28.292
Can I have your arm, please?

01:05:29.972 --> 01:05:31.612
What's going on?

01:05:33.492 --> 01:05:35.332
No...

01:05:38.972 --> 01:05:41.412
Not now. Not yet.

01:05:47.292 --> 01:05:50.092
Let's get a medic.
You get a medic right now. Yes, sir.

01:06:49.532 --> 01:06:51.571
<i>80-yard touchdown!</i>

01:06:51.572 --> 01:06:53.890
<i>America is many things
to many people.</i>

01:06:53.891 --> 01:06:57.211
<i>To a 17-year-old kid,
it's the malt shop on the corner,</i>

01:06:57.212 --> 01:07:01.210
<i>to Grandpa, it's the front porch
in the Blue Mountains.</i>

01:07:01.211 --> 01:07:04.770
<i>To the mother and her family,
it's church...</i>

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:08.249
<i>I'd Like to make it clear
that all procedures were proper.</i>

01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:12.290
<i>This is the same process that was
used in 24 successful shuttle launches</i>

01:07:12.291 --> 01:07:14.290
<i>as well as previous moon landings.</i>

01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:15.850
<i>I know that... Bunch of crap.</i>

01:07:15.851 --> 01:07:18.170
<i>...based on the data
up to January 27,</i>

01:07:18.171 --> 01:07:21.730
<i>right through the launch countdown
until the lift-off,</i>

01:07:21.731 --> 01:07:23.649
<i>all those actions were proper.</i>

01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:26.209
<i>Do you believe you exercised good
judgement on the evening</i>

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:29.929
<i>before the launch, regarding
the temperature? Absolutely.</i>

01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:33.091
I thought I'd drop these to
the cleaners in the morning.

01:07:35.811 --> 01:07:41.370
"Use Ivory Soap. 99.4% pure. "

01:07:41.371 --> 01:07:43.810
What? What did you say?

01:07:43.811 --> 01:07:46.490
I was just, that old Ivory Soap ad.

01:07:46.491 --> 01:07:51.050
"Use Ivory Soap, 99.4% pure. "

01:07:51.051 --> 01:07:52.650
Forget about the cleaners,

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:55.291
I got, I got notes
and stuff in the pockets, so...

01:07:55.292 --> 01:07:57.930
You sure? Yeah.

01:07:57.931 --> 01:08:00.729
<i>Perhaps it's time
to revisit the possibility</i>

01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:04.689
<i>that the Shuttle was a victim
of an act of sabotage or terrorism.</i>

01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:07.769
<i>NASA will present at
Wednesday's televised... Jeez!</i>

01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:10.049
<i>...along with members
from Morton Thiokol.</i>

01:08:10.050 --> 01:08:11.971
<i>Both parties will detail...</i>

01:08:11.972 --> 01:08:15.570
Only 99.4%, you bastards!

01:08:15.571 --> 01:08:17.288
<i>...by the commission, is unclear</i>

01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:20.890
<i>whether we will ever have answers
as to what caused this disaster...</i>

01:08:20.892 --> 01:08:22.050
Gwen!

01:08:23.290 --> 01:08:25.448
Gweneth!

01:08:25.450 --> 01:08:26.930
What's the matter?

01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:30.849
Papa, what's wrong? What?

01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:32.651
I have to go back to Washington.

01:08:36.091 --> 01:08:37.889
Michelle, go back to bed, go on.

01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:39.810
Go on, back to bed, it's all right.

01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:43.850
You need to be here.

01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:45.491
You need to be taken care of.

01:08:45.492 --> 01:08:49.689
We can't come to Washington
with you. She has school.

01:08:49.691 --> 01:08:51.729
She has no idea
how seriously ill you are.

01:08:51.731 --> 01:08:52.850
I have to.

01:08:54.689 --> 01:08:56.089
People died.

01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:59.207
It will happen again. If I don't,
what have the weeks been for?

01:08:59.209 --> 01:09:01.490
I mean, you're the one
who persuaded me.

01:09:01.491 --> 01:09:03.448
And you said it yourself -

01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:05.288
let someone else do it.

01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:07.609
You can't,
you don't have to carry on now.

01:09:09.529 --> 01:09:11.810
Nobody's got the right
to ask that of you.

01:09:11.812 --> 01:09:13.890
I'm the one asking me.

01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:15.770
I'm the one asking.

01:09:23.130 --> 01:09:24.410
OK.

01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:29.249
OK.

01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:34.890
I just wanted to have you to myself
for as long as possible.

01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:44.250
Honey, will you help me?

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:51.247
I got to get it all down.

01:09:51.249 --> 01:09:53.370
My notes, everything I found out.

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:56.690
Got to be one hell of a paper.

01:10:04.210 --> 01:10:10.049
The original tang and clevis seal
design failed to anticipate

01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:15.249
the enormous pressure,
caused by the burning propellant,

01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:18.808
would cause the walls to bow outward,

01:10:18.809 --> 01:10:21.968
a phenomenon known as joint rotation.

01:10:21.969 --> 01:10:26.128
OK? Swell.
My blood is freshly laundered.

01:10:26.129 --> 01:10:29.689
Dick, you know the affects
of the dialysis are only temporary.

01:10:30.969 --> 01:10:32.490
Life is pretty temporary.

01:10:51.049 --> 01:10:54.489
<i>You're listening to drive time
on WTBX with Steve O'Brian.</i>

01:10:57.969 --> 01:11:00.128
<i>Power one-o-three on WTBX.</i>

01:11:00.129 --> 01:11:03.767
<i>We are definitely addicted to
our ten-in-a-row power play for all</i>

01:11:03.768 --> 01:11:07.609
<i>you folks in Washington, coming up
next, Miami Sound Machine...</i>

01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:17.487
Dr Feynman, can you comment
on the progress of the commission?

01:11:17.488 --> 01:11:20.169
What's your take
on the sabotage theory?

01:11:20.170 --> 01:11:22.369
I'm not at liberty to speak.

01:11:32.089 --> 01:11:33.248
The commission?

01:11:33.249 --> 01:11:34.409
Through there, sir.

01:11:37.249 --> 01:11:39.329
I'm sorry, sir.
You can't go in there.

01:11:39.330 --> 01:11:40.608
Who says so?

01:11:40.609 --> 01:11:42.768
Not without a tie, sir.

01:11:42.769 --> 01:11:45.289
Give me strength.

01:11:55.449 --> 01:11:58.009
I'm sure this is going to look
a lot more dainty.

01:12:01.129 --> 01:12:02.569
Good evening, gentlemen.

01:12:05.329 --> 01:12:09.368
My findings,
developed, processed, distilled,

01:12:09.369 --> 01:12:11.727
I've saved you the trouble
of running them off

01:12:11.728 --> 01:12:13.729
in case the copy machine's broken.

01:12:16.048 --> 01:12:18.888
Hey, Bill. Will you do the honours?
Sure.

01:12:18.889 --> 01:12:22.727
It's all here. Hi, Neil. Would you?

01:12:22.728 --> 01:12:25.767
Design flaws in the boosters.

01:12:25.768 --> 01:12:27.328
Management failure.

01:12:29.288 --> 01:12:32.168
A cold day. You OK?

01:12:32.169 --> 01:12:34.528
I had the flu, but now it's flown.

01:12:34.529 --> 01:12:36.209
Why don't you just take this chair?

01:12:46.648 --> 01:12:48.527
Thank you.

01:12:48.528 --> 01:12:51.647
And thank you.

01:12:51.648 --> 01:12:56.487
For your fine, patient,
methodical work over the last weeks.

01:12:56.488 --> 01:12:58.887
It's been a difficult period.

01:12:58.888 --> 01:13:01.327
Especially for Dr Feynman.

01:13:01.328 --> 01:13:03.527
Welcome back, Doctor.

01:13:03.528 --> 01:13:07.126
And Doctor, I'm sure that we'll want
to include some of your new material

01:13:07.127 --> 01:13:08.208
in our final report.

01:13:09.928 --> 01:13:12.928
Please remember this is
a very important hearing.

01:13:12.929 --> 01:13:15.487
We're expecting a lot of press.

01:13:15.488 --> 01:13:18.848
And it will be televised,
so please do be prompt. Thank you.

01:13:31.568 --> 01:13:33.007
Prof.

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:36.686
It's happening again,
Rogers is going to bury my work.

01:13:36.687 --> 01:13:40.168
Yeah, and I just got cornered
outside by the press.

01:13:40.169 --> 01:13:41.647
Me too.

01:13:41.648 --> 01:13:44.127
I think they're ready
to go with "unproven".

01:13:45.127 --> 01:13:47.447
Yep,
or a sniper on the grassy knoll.

01:13:50.727 --> 01:13:52.808
I eat a lot of pickled beets.

01:13:54.088 --> 01:13:57.568
General, I haven't a damned clue
what we're going to do.

01:13:59.728 --> 01:14:03.768
Despite what you may think,
I am pleased to see you back.

01:14:05.968 --> 01:14:08.887
General. Chairman.

01:14:08.888 --> 01:14:12.206
We have a major difficulty.

01:14:12.207 --> 01:14:16.525
The people who best understand the
Shuttle are the people giving evidence

01:14:16.526 --> 01:14:19.807
but they have the most to lose
by explaining it clearly.

01:14:21.487 --> 01:14:23.966
The public is simply mystified.

01:14:23.967 --> 01:14:28.527
Somehow, we need
to penetrate the fog.

01:14:30.327 --> 01:14:31.808
Welcome back.

01:14:36.048 --> 01:14:38.768
We know what Marshall's
strategy's going to be.

01:14:38.769 --> 01:14:41.966
Smokescreen. Manipulate the science.

01:14:41.967 --> 01:14:44.607
Yeah, they'll make it
into a fuzz dazzle.

01:14:46.287 --> 01:14:47.847
That kills me.

01:15:05.407 --> 01:15:06.687
I have to go.

01:15:08.367 --> 01:15:10.286
You OK? I am fine.

01:15:14.047 --> 01:15:15.767
Neil.

01:15:17.807 --> 01:15:19.407
I've been meaning to ask you.

01:15:19.408 --> 01:15:20.726
Yes, Richard.

01:15:20.727 --> 01:15:24.966
This is for a friend. An admirer.

01:15:24.967 --> 01:15:27.127
Right. Of course.

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:30.366
Thanks so much, Neil.

01:15:30.367 --> 01:15:32.726
Sorry, embarrassing but...

01:15:32.727 --> 01:15:35.085
Anything for you, Richard.
Goodnight.

01:15:35.086 --> 01:15:36.407
Take care of yourself.

01:15:37.807 --> 01:15:41.764
You asked me for something, now
I'm going to ask you for something.

01:15:41.765 --> 01:15:44.406
No, you picked me up
a couple of weeks ago.

01:15:47.646 --> 01:15:51.565
Morning. Morning.

01:15:51.566 --> 01:15:53.167
There's my end of the deal.

01:15:53.168 --> 01:15:54.366
All right.

01:15:54.367 --> 01:15:56.446
Here's what I need from you.

01:15:56.447 --> 01:15:58.086
A hardware store.

01:15:58.087 --> 01:16:01.125
A hardware store. Why would
a super important person want...

01:16:01.126 --> 01:16:04.807
Do you know a hardware store
that opens early? I know a place.

01:16:14.326 --> 01:16:16.046
Come on. Get out of bed.

01:16:25.166 --> 01:16:27.924
The astronauts' families
will be seeking clarity

01:16:27.925 --> 01:16:31.564
on what precisely caused
the deaths of their loved ones.

01:16:31.565 --> 01:16:34.845
NASA witnesses
will be answering those questions...

01:16:34.846 --> 01:16:38.286
Graham, make sure you have
a section model of a SRB joint.

01:16:39.526 --> 01:16:42.166
Are we late? We're good for time.

01:16:47.646 --> 01:16:50.046
Hey. Morning, General.
I guess this is it.

01:16:51.086 --> 01:16:52.686
Good luck.

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:27.046
Would the witnesses please rise?

01:17:31.126 --> 01:17:34.684
Do you swear that the testimony
you will give before this commission

01:17:34.685 --> 01:17:36.643
will be the truth, the whole truth

01:17:36.644 --> 01:17:39.005
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:17:39.006 --> 01:17:40.325
I do. I do.

01:17:45.165 --> 01:17:47.725
Mr Mulloy, did you have
any apprehension

01:17:47.726 --> 01:17:52.645
that a delay in launch would reflect
badly on you or NASA Marshall?

01:17:52.646 --> 01:17:54.485
No, not at all.

01:17:54.486 --> 01:17:56.804
My decision to proceed with
the launch as recommended

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:59.644
by the Thiokol official
was based solely on the data

01:17:59.645 --> 01:18:03.244
presented by Thiokol Engineering.
Here comes the smoke.

01:18:03.245 --> 01:18:05.363
This is shot right about
August 19th,

01:18:05.364 --> 01:18:09.403
and the thing of interest here is
what we have seen in the O-rings.

01:18:09.404 --> 01:18:12.445
See, the fact is,
before Challenger, we had seen

01:18:12.446 --> 01:18:16.165
no anomalous O-ring erosion
for about a year.

01:18:22.525 --> 01:18:26.005
Mr McDonald stated that he thought
that what had been said was

01:18:26.006 --> 01:18:30.964
very important - that the secondary
O - ring was in a position to sealed

01:18:30.965 --> 01:18:33.045
during the time of blow-by.

01:18:33.046 --> 01:18:35.605
So you interpreted
Mr McDonald's comment

01:18:35.606 --> 01:18:39.124
as a statement in favour
of proceeding to launch?

01:18:39.125 --> 01:18:42.165
Yes, I certainly did because
Mr McDonald was seated close by,

01:18:42.166 --> 01:18:45.084
and it was clearly
a supportive comment.

01:18:45.085 --> 01:18:46.684
I have a question.

01:18:46.685 --> 01:18:51.524
Can you remind me what NASA
calculates the probability

01:18:51.525 --> 01:18:54.325
of shuttle failure to be?

01:18:55.885 --> 01:18:59.124
Failure meaning
the loss of the vehicle,

01:18:59.125 --> 01:19:01.565
and the deaths of the entire crew.

01:19:02.764 --> 01:19:04.883
Dr Lovingood.

01:19:04.884 --> 01:19:07.204
Certainly. That would be...

01:19:09.404 --> 01:19:12.124
...one in ten to the power of five.

01:19:12.125 --> 01:19:13.245
Really?

01:19:14.765 --> 01:19:16.404
Would you explain that?

01:19:16.405 --> 01:19:20.964
Yes, that the probability
of mission success is 100%.

01:19:20.965 --> 01:19:22.244
Minus Epsilon.

01:19:22.245 --> 01:19:25.244
Epsilon. That's a pretty fancy word.

01:19:25.245 --> 01:19:29.045
Well, let's put all that
you've said there into English.

01:19:29.046 --> 01:19:34.563
So that's, that's one failure
in every 100,000 flights.

01:19:34.564 --> 01:19:38.322
So you claim that the Shuttle
would fly every day for 300 years

01:19:38.323 --> 01:19:40.762
before there would be
a single failure.

01:19:40.763 --> 01:19:43.924
That's crazy, I mean,
how would you ever even test that?

01:19:45.084 --> 01:19:48.242
NASA arrived at that figure
because it was a manned flight.

01:19:48.243 --> 01:19:49.924
Because there are people on board

01:19:49.925 --> 01:19:54.564
but that's not a scientific
calculation, that's... that's a wish.

01:19:54.565 --> 01:19:55.884
And interesting.

01:19:55.885 --> 01:19:59.925
But the figure is very different
from that of NASA's own engineers.

01:19:59.926 --> 01:20:02.203
Based on their direct experience,

01:20:02.204 --> 01:20:05.564
and observation of many known
component problems,

01:20:05.565 --> 01:20:11.083
some of NASA's engineers
calculate the probability of success

01:20:11.084 --> 01:20:12.403
as only 99.4%.

01:20:12.404 --> 01:20:18.364
In other words, that's roughly
one flight in every 200 will fail.

01:20:25.444 --> 01:20:27.404
Rogers, time out.

01:20:28.644 --> 01:20:31.884
I think this would be
an appropriate time to take a break.

01:20:40.364 --> 01:20:41.843
One in 200!

01:20:41.844 --> 01:20:45.483
Wow. That's not what
the astronauts were aware of.

01:20:45.484 --> 01:20:47.722
Potential disaster
every three and half years.

01:20:47.723 --> 01:20:49.964
It won't convince anybody,
there's no proof,

01:20:49.965 --> 01:20:52.883
people don't get probability,
it's math.

01:20:52.884 --> 01:20:54.164
But maybe...

01:21:38.683 --> 01:21:40.881
The segment joint test we did,
the development

01:21:40.882 --> 01:21:45.123
and qualification motor test we did,
as a basis for understanding

01:21:45.124 --> 01:21:48.362
what we could expect
to happen on the joints.

01:21:48.363 --> 01:21:50.282
Mr Hardy. Certainly.

01:21:50.283 --> 01:21:55.683
As we see, the temperature at which
the O-rings would lose their integrity

01:21:55.684 --> 01:21:58.802
would be in the
minus 40 to 50 degree range.

01:21:58.803 --> 01:22:00.963
Minus 40 to 50 degrees.

01:22:02.723 --> 01:22:04.522
Fahrenheit? Sir.

01:22:04.523 --> 01:22:07.002
So they'd maintain their integrity

01:22:07.003 --> 01:22:10.443
down to 80 degrees below freezing?
That is correct.

01:22:14.043 --> 01:22:16.763
Mr Rogers? Oh, yes. Thank you.

01:22:22.003 --> 01:22:23.641
These O-rings...

01:22:24.247 --> 01:22:29.458
are supposed to expand to make a seal,
is that correct? Yes, sir.

01:22:30.642 --> 01:22:32.962
So, for the people to understand,

01:22:32.963 --> 01:22:37.722
what if we take the O-rings out?

01:22:37.723 --> 01:22:39.602
Not have them.

01:22:39.603 --> 01:22:42.923
Well, then hot gas would
expand through the joint.

01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:48.240
For the seal to work correctly,
the O-ring has to be made of rubber,

01:22:49.363 --> 01:22:54.443
not something like lead, which when
you... when you squash it, it stays?

01:22:55.882 --> 01:22:57.201
Yes, sir.

01:22:57.202 --> 01:23:02.841
Now if the O-ring weren't resilient
for a second or two,

01:23:02.842 --> 01:23:06.200
that would be enough for
a very dangerous situation

01:23:06.201 --> 01:23:08.842
and that could likely occur
at low temperatures.

01:23:08.843 --> 01:23:11.561
No, as Mr Hardy has shown,

01:23:11.562 --> 01:23:16.602
they are effective
down to minus 40 to 50 degrees.

01:23:16.603 --> 01:23:20.362
Well, then I just have
one comment for the gentlemen,

01:23:20.363 --> 01:23:24.481
that I have always believed
that any scientific concept

01:23:24.482 --> 01:23:27.122
can be demonstrated
to ordinary people,

01:23:27.123 --> 01:23:32.041
people with no specialist knowledge
or even much scientific education.

01:23:32.042 --> 01:23:35.642
Co-pilot to pilot,
not yet, just wait. What?

01:23:36.922 --> 01:23:38.681
All right. OK, go.

01:23:39.132 --> 01:23:43.514
See. I took some of...
of this...

01:23:44.962 --> 01:23:48.402
stuff from your seal.

01:23:50.562 --> 01:23:55.402
And I put it in
nothing more than ice water.

01:23:58.362 --> 01:24:00.762
And I discover...

01:24:04.722 --> 01:24:07.042
...that if you put it
under pressure...

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:10.406
...for a while,

01:24:10.882 --> 01:24:14.479
and then undo it...

01:24:20.682 --> 01:24:22.282
...it doesn't stretch back.

01:24:23.521 --> 01:24:27.320
It stops. At the same dimension.

01:24:27.321 --> 01:24:31.160
In other words,
for a second or two, at least,

01:24:31.161 --> 01:24:33.841
and more seconds than that,

01:24:33.842 --> 01:24:37.681
there is no resilience
in this particular material

01:24:37.682 --> 01:24:41.201
at the temperature
of 32 degrees Fahrenheit,

01:24:41.202 --> 01:24:43.882
the temperature of a cold soda.

01:24:46.162 --> 01:24:49.282
I think that has some significance
for our problem.

01:25:09.761 --> 01:25:12.800
Whatever the eventual
Commission Report, I will be writing

01:25:12.801 --> 01:25:16.640
up my own independent appendix
with all my findings, all the design,

01:25:16.641 --> 01:25:19.280
the engineering
and the management problems,

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:22.041
which I will be handing
to the President myself.

01:25:23.721 --> 01:25:27.880
How much did NASA know about
the effect of cold, Dr Feynman?

01:25:27.881 --> 01:25:29.481
Look. Ask him.

01:25:31.721 --> 01:25:34.560
Let us make recommendations

01:25:34.561 --> 01:25:37.400
to ensure that NASA officials

01:25:37.401 --> 01:25:39.481
deal in a world of reality.

01:25:41.201 --> 01:25:44.881
Understanding technological
weakness and imperfections

01:25:44.882 --> 01:25:48.521
well enough to be actively
trying to eliminate them.

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:54.400
NASA owes it to the citizens
from whom it asks support

01:25:54.401 --> 01:25:57.160
to be frank, honest and informative.

01:25:57.161 --> 01:25:59.400
For a successful technology,

01:25:59.401 --> 01:26:03.480
reality must take precedence
over public relations,

01:26:03.481 --> 01:26:05.681
for nature cannot be fooled.

01:26:08.081 --> 01:26:10.521
Dr Keel, please.

01:26:13.241 --> 01:26:17.681
And Mr President, this appendix has
been prepared by Professor Feynman.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.360
And by the way, I think I've
figured out who was your source.

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:33.840
You said, "This astronaut,
this astronaut. "

01:26:33.841 --> 01:26:36.041
If it was a guy,
you would have said "he. "

01:26:38.401 --> 01:26:41.721
It's OK. I can keep shtoom.

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:50.399
If you ever fancy
a ride in that old Buick...

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.360
Yeah. If the weather's warm.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.720
It would have to happen pretty soon.

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.399
I'm sorry this is taking your time.

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:04.199
I'm not sorry.

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.638
I would have been tremendously
sorry if we'd lost

01:27:06.639 --> 01:27:07.880
but as it is, it was...

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.480
Not a good use of science.

01:27:10.481 --> 01:27:14.000
It's a good use of science.

01:27:14.001 --> 01:27:15.041
I'm OK.

01:27:16.121 --> 01:27:18.199
I'm OK with it.

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.959
I guess there is a kind of afterlife.

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.280
The few bits and pieces that we do
might get remembered.

01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:28.760
General...

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:32.800
...fix your hair.
