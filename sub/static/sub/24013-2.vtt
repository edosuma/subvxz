00:51.885 --> 00:54.888
Flyers! Take your places!

01:01.102 --> 01:04.355
Would you prefer to be fast, Mr. Dinkles,

01:04.438 --> 01:06.775
-or furious?
-Meep.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.610
Oh, my, Mr. Dinkles.

01:08.693 --> 01:11.071
On your mark.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.989
Get set.

01:15.366 --> 01:16.576
Stop!

01:16.659 --> 01:17.994
Stop now!

01:18.078 --> 01:20.080
You're all in danger!

01:24.667 --> 01:26.336
Poppy, you got to stop them.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.712
Flyer riding is number 12

01:27.796 --> 01:30.465
on the safety inspector's
top 100 town hazards.

01:30.548 --> 01:33.718
Branch, this hazards list is insane.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.470
Everybody loves the shroom bounce.

01:39.849 --> 01:40.975
You know what they say.

01:41.059 --> 01:44.354
"It's all fun and games till someone
irreversibly contorts a spine."

01:44.437 --> 01:46.356
And the Trollberry cupcakes?

01:46.439 --> 01:48.149
What's so unsanitary about them?

01:49.359 --> 01:51.319
Who wants dessert?

01:51.402 --> 01:54.364
Cooper doesn't wear gloves. Ugh.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.200
Branch, you can't ask the Trolls
to give up fencing.

01:57.283 --> 02:00.453
Of course I can.
Do you know how pointy those things are?

02:05.959 --> 02:08.336
Look, I get it.

02:08.419 --> 02:11.297
It only makes sense that you would want
to protect everyone else.

02:11.381 --> 02:14.384
But too much safety can be... smothering.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.718
Aah!

02:15.802 --> 02:19.139
I mean, it would be a tragedy
if we made things so safe

02:19.222 --> 02:21.558
that we weren't allowed to fly.

02:21.641 --> 02:22.517
Giddyup!

02:22.600 --> 02:23.768
Poppy, get down!

02:23.852 --> 02:25.687
Yeah!

02:25.770 --> 02:27.689
See, Branch?

02:27.772 --> 02:30.191
No crash!

02:30.275 --> 02:32.610
Riding flyers is the best!

02:37.574 --> 02:40.743
-Poppy!
-Wah! Oh! Ow! Eeh! Ugh!

02:46.916 --> 02:48.626
I hope she's okay.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.753
-Oh, P. I can't believe she fell.
-Oh, my.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.298
Step aside. I'm a doctor.

02:57.093 --> 02:59.012
Balloon animal.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.265
Glitter.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.725
Cookie.

03:06.978 --> 03:10.273
There's nothing left to do now but pray.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.150
And bandage her minor sprain.

03:15.486 --> 03:16.613
Ow.

03:19.699 --> 03:20.617
Hmm!

03:20.700 --> 03:24.120
Time for Troll Village security plan
five-Delta-zero.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.061
Hmm.

03:57.153 --> 03:58.738
Poppy!

03:58.821 --> 04:01.241
I found the perfect thing
to prevent flying accidents.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.367
Really?

04:06.037 --> 04:09.290
By all that is Troll-y,
what is that thing?

04:09.374 --> 04:11.125
An eyestalk. Isn't it great?

04:11.209 --> 04:13.253
Danger. Danger.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.963
Aah! Hmm?

04:15.797 --> 04:18.966
- Mm...
- Safe. Safe.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.760
The village needs this.

04:20.843 --> 04:24.097
I mean, if we'd had one yesterday,
you wouldn't have gotten hurt.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.557
And I can't let that happen again.

04:26.641 --> 04:30.561
Aw, Branch... well, it's amazing.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.814
And I know I say that
about a lot of things.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.691
But this time I really mean it.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.985
-Just like every other time!
-Hmm?

04:37.068 --> 04:41.739
Before we use it in the village, though,
I need to think about it first, okay?

04:41.823 --> 04:43.783
Of course!

04:49.414 --> 04:52.583
Oh, you mean, like, for a while.

04:52.667 --> 04:56.421
Well, I wish she'd just said yes,
but I guess I can wait.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.549
No hands!

04:59.632 --> 05:02.802
Hair only.

05:05.513 --> 05:08.599
Sorry, Poppy,
but no one's getting hurt again,

05:08.683 --> 05:09.851
not on my watch.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.439
Danger. Danger. Danger.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.860
Safe. Safe. Safe.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.570
-Aww.
-What a rip.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.322
I'm also upset.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.407
Flying is risk-free now, guys.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.367
No need to thank me!

05:26.451 --> 05:29.078
Danger. Danger. Danger.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.373
Hmm. I like the way you think. Pkew!

05:38.921 --> 05:41.382
Danger. Danger.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.010
Safe. Safe. Safe.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.433
-Danger. Danger. Danger.
-Hmm?

05:51.350 --> 05:53.394
Safe. Safe. Safe.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.106
- Danger. Danger.
- Hey!

06:00.693 --> 06:02.153
Well, that was odd.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.321
Care to go swim at the lagoon?

06:03.404 --> 06:08.618
Well, it  has  been less than hour
since I ate, but absolutely!

06:08.701 --> 06:11.412
Danger. Danger. Danger.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.338
Danger. Danger. Danger.

06:20.421 --> 06:21.339
Danger.

06:21.422 --> 06:24.300
-Danger. Danger.
-Danger. Danger.

06:24.383 --> 06:27.678
Danger. Danger. Danger.
Danger. Danger. Danger. Danger.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.723
Danger. Danger. Danger.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.017
Poppy. Hey, Poppy!

06:33.101 --> 06:36.729
Wait till you see what I've done.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.399
Stay back! Go!

06:40.483 --> 06:44.487
Branch, with my leg bandaged,
this thing won't even let me...

06:44.570 --> 06:45.738
...out of bed.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.073
Safe.

06:47.156 --> 06:51.536
Ugh, plant, I swear, if you
lovingly tuck me in one more time!

06:51.619 --> 06:54.247
Safe. Safe.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.207
Whew! Thanks.

06:56.290 --> 07:00.128
My gosh. Those eyestalks are crazy.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.548
I am so glad that we didn't use them
in the village.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.383
Uh... yeah.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.135
Me too.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.178
I'm gonna look over here.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.514
Um, why are you turning red?

07:11.597 --> 07:16.436
What? Oh, uh...
must be my true colors just for you.

07:16.519 --> 07:20.857
Branch! You planted those eyestalks
even though I told you not to?

07:20.940 --> 07:22.066
Well, yeah...

07:22.150 --> 07:25.528
but that was just classic
Poppy-Branch playful banter, right?

07:25.611 --> 07:28.030
-That's our thing.
-I am so disappointed.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.323
Please go.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.491
Wait, Poppy--

07:30.575 --> 07:32.201
I said go, Branch!

07:41.419 --> 07:43.504
Danger. Danger.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.922
So unfair.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.925
She wants to scrap them
all over one tiny glitch?

07:48.009 --> 07:51.846
The eyestalks are the best thing
that ever happened to this village.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.099
Okay, this is bad.

07:59.854 --> 08:00.980
Hello, Branch.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.232
Your plant friends like hugging,
don't they?

08:03.316 --> 08:06.486
-Ooh!
-We love you, too.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.321
No. No. No, no.

08:08.404 --> 08:11.324
Huh. Wonder if I need sunscreen today.

08:11.407 --> 08:12.283
Nah.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.576
- Danger.
- Oh, my Guh!

08:13.659 --> 08:17.079
Huh. Maybe just a little extra salt.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.040
-Danger. Danger.
-Ah! Five-second rule.

08:19.123 --> 08:21.167
-I'm gonna play this card here.
-Danger.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.002
Danger.

08:23.085 --> 08:24.629
Teach me your ways, plant!

08:24.712 --> 08:27.256
- No, this can't be.
- But it is.

08:28.758 --> 08:29.884
Thanks to you.

08:29.967 --> 08:34.263
I wanted you to keep my friends safe,
not in the air doing nothing.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.557
Tell me why you did this right now.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.267
Cannot tell it to you.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.062
Much rather sing it to you!

09:18.516 --> 09:21.394
-We want more! We want more!
-Bravo!

09:21.477 --> 09:23.271
Guys, not now.

09:23.354 --> 09:24.564
Poppy was right.

09:24.647 --> 09:25.565
You  are  crazy.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.441
Poppy no more danger.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.694
Poppy dealt with.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.988
Plant, you are getting on my last nerve!

09:32.071 --> 09:33.823
No, you can't. Let her go!

09:33.906 --> 09:34.949
Impossible.

09:35.032 --> 09:36.701
Poppy hurt Branch's feelings.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.744
Trolls stay safe at all costs.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.329
Safe is what you wanted.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.082
Well, it's not what I want anymore.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.562
Danger. Danger.

10:05.521 --> 10:06.856
Huh?

10:12.903 --> 10:15.906
Stay away from her!

10:19.076 --> 10:21.537
- Danger. Danger.
- Awesome!

10:21.621 --> 10:23.748
Uh... danger. Heh.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.554
Danger. Danger.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.848
Oh, man, I'm out of moves.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.933
Poppy, I'm so sorry.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.435
Oh, Branch.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.562
You should be.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.522
Safe? Safe?

10:49.732 --> 10:51.317
Yes! See?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.194
She's not dangerous.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.113
My feelings got hurt, but she's right.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.699
Too much safety can be smothering.

10:58.783 --> 11:02.203
Danger? Safe? Danger? Safe?

11:02.286 --> 11:07.500
Danger? Safe? Danger? Safe?

11:07.583 --> 11:08.626
Awesome!

11:08.709 --> 11:10.795
Look! One seems to get it.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.798
Yeah! Well, better get rid of him.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.174
No!

11:15.257 --> 11:17.093
I've got another idea.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.347
Awesome! Awesome!

11:21.430 --> 11:22.932
Wow, this is great.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.184
-Thank you.
-Of course.

11:25.267 --> 11:28.270
I'm all for safety,
as long as we don't go overboard.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.940
See, what I think we learned today is--

11:31.023 --> 11:32.400
Uh, Poppy?

11:32.483 --> 11:33.901
Are we gonna do this or what?

11:33.984 --> 11:36.070
Oh, you're on.

11:42.618 --> 11:43.619
Danger.

11:53.754 --> 11:58.342
It's you. And me. And a pizza!

11:58.426 --> 12:02.263
The food we ate
on the night we fell in love.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.640
-Oh, Gristle, it's too much.
-Uh-uh.

12:04.723 --> 12:07.143
Only the best for our one-month-iversary.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.562
Which reminds me, I ordered Chad
to spend the whole day

12:09.645 --> 12:11.856
picking your favorite flowers.

12:15.985 --> 12:16.986
Pretty!

12:17.069 --> 12:19.238
I mean, technically,
daisies are my favorite,

12:19.321 --> 12:21.157
but those are totally nice, too.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.616
Not your favorite?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.160
Chad, you fool!

12:24.243 --> 12:27.121
Destroy those roses
and bring milady every daisy in town!

12:29.248 --> 12:31.834
Uh, Gristle, you were kind of harsh
to Chad.

12:31.917 --> 12:35.838
- You made his face go all...
- I did?

12:35.921 --> 12:38.215
But only 'cause I want
to make today special.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.843
And my daddy always said
a king should get what he wants.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.512
Just like he did,
and his daddy before him.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.973
Yeah, Gristle, you do realize

12:46.056 --> 12:48.934
that's kind of a horrible view
on life, right?

12:49.018 --> 12:50.519
Eh, potato, potato.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.439
Now, are you ready for a date
you'll never forget?

12:54.398 --> 12:57.693
Well... duh. Of course I am.

12:57.776 --> 13:00.404
Why do you think I stayed up all night
making these?

13:01.489 --> 13:04.116
Mint-green his-and-hers jumpsuits,

13:04.200 --> 13:06.160
hand-sewn by yours truly.

13:06.243 --> 13:09.622
One thread for every beat of my heart.

13:09.705 --> 13:10.956
Sugar cereal!

13:11.040 --> 13:13.417
Bridget, this gift just proves
how in sync we are.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.710
Really?

13:14.793 --> 13:17.254
Yeah, 'cause last night,
I had Todd make jumpsuits, too.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.797
Even better ones.

13:18.881 --> 13:22.927
"Even better"?
But I-I worked hard on these.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.387
Oh, I know. But these are really nice.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.057
And tonight we should look
our really nicest.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.642
You're welcome.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.561
Uh, schmoopy?

13:32.645 --> 13:35.648
Your mouth just went down
when it should've gone up.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.194
Bridget?

13:40.277 --> 13:43.030
Was it something you said?

13:43.113 --> 13:46.033
Sweetie, wait, hold on.

13:46.116 --> 13:48.536
Huh? Um, Bridget,
I'm not sure if you know this,

13:48.619 --> 13:52.164
but there's a door between us,
so I can't comfort you.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.541
Go away, Gristle!

13:53.624 --> 13:55.876
I didn't come in here to be comforted.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.088
I came in here to angry dance.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.776
Bridget, are you... mad at me?

14:20.860 --> 14:23.654
Your Majesty,
a troll infiltrated the castle walls.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.823
- This Troll.
- Hey!

14:25.906 --> 14:27.491
Put me down!

14:27.575 --> 14:30.911
I'm late to help Bridget get ready
for her big date!

14:31.871 --> 14:33.998
It might be helpful
if you fill in your guards

14:34.081 --> 14:36.959
on the whole "Trolls and Bergens
are friends now" thing.

14:37.042 --> 14:40.045
What does it matter?
What does anything matter?

14:40.129 --> 14:42.840
The most wonderful girl in the world
is mad at me.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.009
I'm not mad at--oh, Bridget.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.093
Wait, what did you do?

14:46.176 --> 14:47.303
Bridge?

14:47.386 --> 14:49.972
You okay in there, girlfriend?

14:52.224 --> 14:54.393
Poppy? No, girlfriend.

14:54.476 --> 14:57.688
Gristle and I have relationship issues,
girlfriend.

14:57.771 --> 15:00.274
Ooh! Well, lay it on me, girlfriend.

15:00.357 --> 15:03.611
I'm just sick of him
being so thoughtless, Poppy.

15:03.694 --> 15:06.071
Oh, I know what you must think.

15:06.155 --> 15:09.074
"How can she complain? He's perfect."

15:09.158 --> 15:12.286
Uh... yeah.

15:12.369 --> 15:13.913
But I think I know
where you're coming from.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.748
So all better now, right?

15:15.831 --> 15:18.000
No, you hurt her feelings.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.003
Before she forgives you,
don't you think there's something obvious

15:21.086 --> 15:22.129
you need to do first?

15:22.212 --> 15:26.967
Hmm. I do seem to remember
my daddy saying a few things about...

15:37.269 --> 15:38.562
Ah!

15:44.568 --> 15:47.571
Ah, okay, enough! Gristle, this is absurd.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.240
All Bridget really wants is an apology!

15:50.324 --> 15:53.118
Hmm. Sounds familiar.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.328
That's a cake, right?

15:56.664 --> 15:57.581
Okay.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.501
Gristle's got to learn some basics
on how to treat people,

16:00.584 --> 16:03.545
so we're gonna give him
some practice apologizing

16:03.629 --> 16:05.923
until he's ready for the real Bridget.

16:06.006 --> 16:08.300
For the record, I despise this.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.760
Branch! Zip it.

16:09.843 --> 16:12.388
Gristle apologizes to Bridget, take one.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.347
Action.

16:13.430 --> 16:16.600
Hey, Bridget, uh, how's it going?

16:17.851 --> 16:19.812
She's fine. Keep talking!

16:19.895 --> 16:22.439
Bridget, all I want
is for you to not be mad,

16:22.523 --> 16:24.733
and as king,
I should probably get what I want.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.651
The end.

16:25.734 --> 16:28.737
What an effective use of our day.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.489
Not helping.

16:30.572 --> 16:33.158
Gristle, not gonna sugarcoat it,
that was awful.

16:33.242 --> 16:37.496
Next time, remember to use words
like "sorry" and "forgive."

16:37.579 --> 16:38.789
Okay, take two.

16:38.872 --> 16:40.457
Bridget, please.

16:40.541 --> 16:44.044
I'm so sorry you have yet to forgive me.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.045
Aah!

16:45.129 --> 16:46.714
Okay, we need a new approach.

16:48.048 --> 16:50.092
- Bridget?
- Go away!

16:50.175 --> 16:53.012
The last thing I want
is for you to be upset with me.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.096
Hmm?

16:54.179 --> 16:55.806
I lost sight of what mattered.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.891
I lost sight of what mattered.

16:57.975 --> 17:01.729
And you are the morning sun
bringing light to my eyes.

17:01.812 --> 17:05.566
And you are the morning sun
bringing light to my eyes.

17:05.648 --> 17:08.484
Wow. Branch is smooth.

17:08.569 --> 17:09.819
Ugh, I know.

17:09.903 --> 17:12.156
But keep it down.
It'll go straight to his head.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.906
Each moment we're apart,

17:13.991 --> 17:16.910
I feel like I'm missing a piece of myself.

17:16.993 --> 17:21.205
Each moment we're apart,
I feel like I'm missing a piece of myself.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.958
Now tell her you're sorry.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.417
Bridget, you're sorry.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.836
Oh, my Guh!

17:25.919 --> 17:28.797
-Oh, my Guh.
-This isn't going well, is it?

17:28.881 --> 17:30.758
This isn't going well, is it?

17:30.841 --> 17:33.510
Wait, did you just use an accent?

17:33.594 --> 17:36.764
No, no, tell her this is the last time
you'll ever hurt her feelings.

17:36.847 --> 17:37.973
A-and that you're sorry

17:38.057 --> 17:40.976
and the only thing in the world you want
is for her to forgive you.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.771
This is the last time
I'll ever hurt your feelings.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.982
I'm sorry, and the only thing in the world
I want is for her--

17:47.066 --> 17:49.443
er,  you  to forgive me.

17:49.526 --> 17:52.905
Gristle,
that's all I wanted to hear.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.782
Apology accepted.

17:54.865 --> 17:58.535
Give me a second to freshen up.
Then we can go on our date.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.914
If you still want to.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.958
Hot lunch. You know I do.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.966
Yes! For a minute there, I wasn't sure
that you were gonna pull it off,

18:13.050 --> 18:15.761
but I think you learned something
here today, Gristle.

18:15.844 --> 18:16.970
Oh, I did.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.723
Thanks to you, Poppy,
I learned that after a fight,

18:19.807 --> 18:23.352
apologizing is the only way...
to get what I want.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.686
Wait, what?

18:27.689 --> 18:29.066
All set.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.445
Okay, I'm gonna go out on a limb here

18:33.529 --> 18:37.616
and say Gristle might have taken
the wrong lesson from all of this.

18:38.867 --> 18:42.121
-My moon.
-My stars.

18:42.204 --> 18:46.291
-My universe.
-My... back to moon again.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.503
Wow, this is gonna be
the most romantic night ever.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.880
Oh.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.133
Looks like there's a long wait.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.717
Not for us, honey bunny.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.095
We don't have to wait on our perfect date,

18:58.178 --> 19:00.222
as long as we apologize.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.766
Sorry. Sorry!

19:02.850 --> 19:05.853
Uh, Gristle,
you just manhandled that Bergen.

19:05.936 --> 19:08.355
You're right... I'm sorry to say.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.606
Sorry. Sorry.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.400
Sorry.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.902
Oh, no, we've created a monster.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.613
-"We"?
-We're better as a team. Get used to it.

19:16.697 --> 19:17.531
Come on.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.868
Isn't this table delightful?

19:20.951 --> 19:23.871
Hold on. Gristle, we need to talk.

19:23.954 --> 19:27.875
Oh, we will, fuzzy blanket,
but first we need our dinner.

19:27.958 --> 19:31.712
And what do you know?
There's a pizza right... here.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.380
Gristle!

19:33.463 --> 19:36.383
My apologies.

19:36.466 --> 19:38.093
-I can't beli--
-Shh, shh, shh. Not yet.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.762
For what's a romantic dinner
without music?

19:40.846 --> 19:42.931
Hey!

19:43.015 --> 19:44.433
-Sorry!
-Wha--

19:44.516 --> 19:47.311
Romance is calling.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.062
Drafty.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.190
Milady mustn't be cold.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.566
-One moment.
-Gristle--

19:57.738 --> 19:59.573
A thousand pardons.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.533
We've got to stop him.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.495
Yah!

20:05.579 --> 20:07.748
Shall we hit the rink?

20:07.831 --> 20:10.667
Hit the rink?
After the way you've been behaving?

20:10.751 --> 20:12.294
- Aah!
- Whoa!

20:12.377 --> 20:13.837
Poppy? Branch?

20:13.921 --> 20:15.005
Are you on a date, too?

20:15.088 --> 20:17.466
- Uh...
- No.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.844
Listen, Gristle, I'm sorry.
I should've been more clear earlier.

20:20.928 --> 20:25.098
You can't just use apologies
as an excuse to do whatever you want.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.267
Why not? Our date's going great.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.936
Now, can you go, please?

20:29.019 --> 20:30.812
You're kind of killing the mood.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.900
Sorry, Poppy. Sorry, Branch.

20:34.983 --> 20:35.984
Now, where were we?

20:38.362 --> 20:40.822
Gristle, those are our friends.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.115
I can't believe--

20:42.199 --> 20:44.618
I mean, I'm--I'm just so...

20:44.701 --> 20:46.954
Wow, a lot of anger to process.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.334
Bridget, wait!

20:54.962 --> 20:56.338
No! Please, don't!

20:56.421 --> 20:59.258
But I thought that...

20:59.341 --> 21:01.343
How many locks does this door have?

21:01.426 --> 21:03.303
I thought you changed,

21:03.387 --> 21:06.807
but you're even thoughtless-er
than before.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.392
Just go.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.894
Again? For how long this time?

21:10.978 --> 21:13.230
Forever.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.695
I don't get it.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.656
I did your apology thing,
but I lost Bridget anyway.

21:22.739 --> 21:24.658
You guys got to help me fix this.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.326
-Okay, here's what we do--
-Nope.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.869
-"Nope"?
-Yeah, that's right.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.081
We can't fix things with Bridget, Gristle.
Only you can.

21:31.164 --> 21:33.792
And you better do more
than just say you're sorry.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.211
You've got to actually show her
you mean it.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.299
I  am  sorry, Bridget.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.134
And I'm gonna show you that I mean it.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.933
Sorry about your tablecloth. Really.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.769
And I'm sorry about tripping you.
Not cool.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.565
And, hey, I'm sorry I took your song.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.482
Hmm!

22:00.652 --> 22:01.737
Wow, Gristle.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.614
You might be getting the hang
of apologizing after all.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.867
I agree.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.328
I'm so sorry, Bridget.

22:09.411 --> 22:10.704
I wish I'd been more thoughtful,

22:10.787 --> 22:14.291
especially when you wanted me to wear
that beautiful jumpsuit you made.

22:14.374 --> 22:15.834
But I can't change what I did.

22:15.917 --> 22:19.212
All I can say is,
I'm ready to wear it now.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.923
-Ooh! Oh. Okay, that's enough.
-Ah...

22:22.007 --> 22:23.133
Forgive me?

22:23.216 --> 22:26.636
Oh, Gristle, of course I will.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.930
Now, can you put your clothes back on?
