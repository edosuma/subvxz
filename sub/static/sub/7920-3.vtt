00:02.536 --> 00:04.269
Just make up an excuse

00:04.271 --> 00:05.637
and get out
of jury duty, Jess.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.039
Please, I need you.
No, Nick.

00:07.041 --> 00:08.874
It's a right
and a privilege.

00:08.876 --> 00:10.876
In South Africa, they
don't even have juries.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.511
They have a-a judge
and two assessors.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.213
God, I would have
bullied you as a kid.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.281
Jury duty is supposed
to be a sacrifice.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.883
Would I like to be
at work right now,

00:17.885 --> 00:19.885
participating in the
Spirit Week assembly?

00:19.887 --> 00:21.720
Yeah, I would.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.756
I've turned in some memorable
performances in the past.

00:29.897 --> 00:31.897
But it's just one day--
you'll be fine without me.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.866
Now that Cece
and Schmidt are engaged,

00:33.868 --> 00:37.703
she's here all the time,
and her stuff is everywhere.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.371
Okay, yes, she's a hot slob.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.540
Ever since she got boobs, people
stopped making her do stuff.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.809
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, that is not an excuse.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.911
When I first grew boobs,
people started handing me stuff,

00:45.913 --> 00:48.180
and I got messy, but then
you got to grow up.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.182
Not the same thing.
They're just boobs.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.184
I promise you, tonight when
I get back from jury duty,

00:52.186 --> 00:55.187
I will explain it to her in
a way that she'll listen to,

00:55.189 --> 00:57.589
unlike your way, where
she'll rip your dingle off

00:57.591 --> 00:59.825
and sew it back on your
head like a unicorn horn.

00:59.827 --> 01:00.993
She doesn't even live here.

01:00.995 --> 01:02.194
She never signed
our loft agreement.

01:02.196 --> 01:04.096
She doesn't even
know all the rules.

01:04.098 --> 01:06.098
(laughing):
Hi. Look at you in red.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.666
You look so cute.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.835
(chuckling):
Thank you.

01:09.837 --> 01:12.004
CECE:
Love this top.

01:12.006 --> 01:14.073
Jess, Nick needs to stop telling
that wet pants story, okay?

01:14.075 --> 01:16.775
I know. I've heard it
four times this week.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.044
So I take a hot glass
out of the dishwasher,

01:19.046 --> 01:21.447
I pour cold
water into it,

01:21.449 --> 01:22.881
then the customer
picks up the glass,

01:22.883 --> 01:24.283
and the bottom falls off.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.617
Oh, that's crazy.
For real?

01:25.619 --> 01:27.019
NICK: He looks down,
and he goes like this:

01:27.021 --> 01:28.687
(Italian accent):
"Oh, my pants are wet."

01:28.689 --> 01:30.589
(laughing)

01:30.591 --> 01:33.525
I know, he-he needs
to shape that story.

01:33.527 --> 01:34.927
I don't know how
you live with him.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.528
He is the most obnoxious...

01:36.530 --> 01:37.796

01:38.966 --> 01:40.365
Stop. Stop it.
Knock it off.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.366
Jess, are you cool
with me hanging

01:41.368 --> 01:43.202
this groundbreaking poster

01:43.204 --> 01:44.703
of dogs playing poker
on the wall?

01:44.705 --> 01:46.538
Jess, please tell him
that he cannot hang

01:46.540 --> 01:48.440
this horrible painting.
I really have to go.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.908
I think it's hilarious--
they're playing poker.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.276
Rather see a painting

01:51.278 --> 01:52.778
of Arnold Schwarzenegger,
mid-coitus.

01:52.780 --> 01:53.779
(grunts)

01:53.781 --> 01:55.314
Just straight up doing it.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.971
On the plus side, I'm being very witty
during this fight! You know what, Nick?

07:19.973 --> 07:21.940
WOMAN:
Number 24.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.642
Number 16.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.410
Yes! Sorry.

07:25.412 --> 07:26.878
I never win anything.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.314
(phone ringing)
Sorry. Uh, uh... oh.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.049
Dr. Foster, is everything okay?

07:31.051 --> 07:32.284
FOSTER:
J.D.?

07:32.286 --> 07:33.251
It ain't.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.619
I decided I was gonna be

07:34.621 --> 07:36.588
Marcus the Meerkat,
because, you know,

07:36.590 --> 07:39.491
you and I have remarkably
similar body shapes.

07:39.493 --> 07:40.926
Okay.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.160
Um, what's the problem?

07:42.162 --> 07:44.262
I fell and shattered my hip.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.131
Oh, God! I'm so sorry.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.566
How bad is it?

07:47.568 --> 07:50.402
The, uh, paramedic
described my left leg

07:50.404 --> 07:53.338
as a skin bag full of

07:53.340 --> 07:54.906
hip shards?

07:54.908 --> 07:56.842
A skin... a skin bag

08:01.815 --> 08:03.281

08:03.283 --> 08:04.416
Yes!

08:04.418 --> 08:06.818

08:06.820 --> 08:09.588
Oh... but my number
just got called.

08:09.590 --> 08:10.989
Well, that means

08:10.991 --> 08:12.424
the district's gonna be

08:12.426 --> 08:15.160
bringing in Becky Cavatappi.
Ugh!

08:15.162 --> 08:17.195
They've been pushing her
for my job.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.497
She has fake zoomers.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.165
What kind of message
does that send

08:20.167 --> 08:21.967
to girls with growing zoomers?

08:21.969 --> 08:24.269
I think she had
her butt done, too.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.837
Every time she runs,

08:25.839 --> 08:28.006
that thing sounds like
an Indian rain stick.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.774
I really want
to be principal, so, um...

08:29.776 --> 08:31.009
I'll be there.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.979
Uh, I'll just have to, um...

08:33.981 --> 08:36.314

08:36.316 --> 08:37.949
I'll talk to you soon!

08:37.951 --> 08:39.284
(shrieks in pain)

08:41.622 --> 08:43.688
Sorry.
It's a tense situation.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.195
So who should I call next
to tell my story?

08:50.197 --> 08:52.112
I'm not cleaning till you
get off the phone, Nicole.

08:52.138 --> 08:53.098

09:18.659 --> 09:20.158
Don't call me Nicole!

09:20.160 --> 09:21.760
Okay, Nick-hole!

09:21.762 --> 09:23.495
Yeah. That's happening.

Yeah.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.201
I don't know what to do.
I'm sure Cece

09:30.203 --> 09:31.570
has her flaws,
but I just can't see them.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.538
And even if I could,
what would I do?

09:33.540 --> 09:35.440
How does a man stand up
to the sunset?

09:35.442 --> 09:37.876
Cece and Nick are basically
the same person.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.511
Both stubborn, hotheaded

09:39.513 --> 09:40.745
and brutally honest.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.447
Oh, dear Lord.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.382
I'm marrying Nick.
Duh.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.051
Aw. I kind of love that.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.519
All right,
what should we do?

09:47.521 --> 09:48.753
Can't go to
Cece's apartment.

Look, get Cece to sign
the loft agreement.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.263
Nick wrote it,

09:58.265 --> 10:00.398
They'll both play hardball

are Pakistani militants.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.588
That's what I do; works every time.
Yeah.

10:56.590 --> 10:58.189
Why'd you have an accent
when you said "Pakistani"?

10:58.191 --> 10:59.958

I not!
Now you're losing verbs!

15:13.847 --> 15:15.546
So, are the squirrel and
the rabbit-- they're friends?

15:15.548 --> 15:16.915
Hey, babe, do not
get concerned.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.549
He's probably just
tired or hungry,

15:18.551 --> 15:20.051
or getting jealous
that I'm spending

15:20.053 --> 15:22.387
so much time with
his best friend.

15:22.389 --> 15:25.390
As a matter of fact,
I am tired, and I am hungry,

15:25.392 --> 15:28.459
but the third thing
is way off base.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.962
If you weren't a girl,
Uh-huh?

15:30.964 --> 15:33.131
I'd karate chop you in the mouth.
You would get winded

15:33.133 --> 15:35.967
just trying to ball
your fist up, dough-boy.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.568
Well, good thing you don't need
a fist for a karate chop,

15:37.570 --> 15:39.804
you stupid idiot.
You are such a door knob.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.572
And if I wanted to karate chop
you, you'd be dead!

15:41.574 --> 15:42.607
(laughs) Look at her flinch.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.741
This is good.
So scared.

15:43.743 --> 15:44.876
Shakey-shakey.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.044
I literally have
not moved.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.212
I'm so not worried about you.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.682
(panting)

15:52.719 --> 15:54.152
You want to go take a nap now?

15:54.154 --> 15:56.154
Stop! I can't listen
to the two people

15:56.156 --> 15:58.289
I love most in this world
fight like this.

15:59.726 --> 16:00.792
Sorry, Winston.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.293
Huh? What'd he say?

16:03.596 --> 16:05.296
(door slams)

16:05.298 --> 16:06.531
(thud)

16:10.103 --> 16:12.203
Oh, no.

16:14.841 --> 16:18.509
Schmidt, what
did you do?

16:19.746 --> 16:20.845
So, you are all

16:20.847 --> 16:22.413
serving on this jury.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.084
This is a capital case

16:26.086 --> 16:27.618
and will last
upwards of a month,

16:27.620 --> 16:29.654
and due to media exposure,

16:29.656 --> 16:32.023
you will have to be sequestered.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.659
So go home, pack a bag,

16:34.661 --> 16:35.860
do not e-mail me.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.929
The answer is yes.

16:37.931 --> 16:40.832
Your hotel does have a pool,

16:40.834 --> 16:45.169
but is otherwise
aggressively mediocre.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.539
There, I banged the thing.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.907
Yep.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.114
Okay.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.615
I need a stapler.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.384
You stay.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.220
Hey.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.621
Hey.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.189
So here we are.

17:07.293 --> 17:08.826
All right, Nick,
I'll sign it.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.061
I don't want to
hurt Schmidt,

17:10.063 --> 17:11.662
and right now,
he's probably just

17:11.664 --> 17:13.197
crying his eyes
out at the...

17:13.199 --> 17:14.499
BOTH:
Denim bar.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.968
(crying)

17:16.970 --> 17:18.703
I really appreciate you keeping

17:18.705 --> 17:21.239
the store open
for me late, Maurice.

17:21.241 --> 17:22.974
That denim bar is like
his temple.

17:22.976 --> 17:25.476
He legitimately wants us
to get married there.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.844
At a denim bar?
Yeah.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.646
Look, Schmidt and I
are not gonna work

17:28.648 --> 17:30.214
if you and I can't get along.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.349
Because...

17:31.351 --> 17:33.384
you're Schmidt's family.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.552
In a way,

17:34.554 --> 17:35.920
it's like we're engaged.

17:35.922 --> 17:36.988
You're not my type.

17:36.990 --> 17:39.690
I like them crazier and...

17:39.692 --> 17:41.426
and sexually very prude.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.261
Oh.
You just don't fit the bill.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.196
Look, you don't have
to sign this thing.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.265
It's stupid.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.733
The last page is just

17:48.735 --> 17:51.402
obscene drawings
of cartoon princesses.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.037
I saw them;
you're very talented.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.572
Thanks. What they're doing
is disgusting,

17:54.574 --> 17:56.074
but I think the drawings
are nice.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.742
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.745
Look, if I'm being honest,

18:00.747 --> 18:04.115
yeah, I feel a little jealous.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.350
You know, Schmidt and I
used to hang out

18:06.352 --> 18:08.186
all the time,
and now we don't,

18:08.188 --> 18:09.720
and it's weird.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.523
I mean, to be honest,
I think I was a little...

18:12.525 --> 18:13.691
jealous, too.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.560
Of me?
In a way,

18:15.562 --> 18:18.262
you're always gonna know him
a little bit better than me.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.500
Except physically.
You'd be surprised.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.571
Hey.

18:26.573 --> 18:27.705
Schmidt, relax.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.207
We're good.
Yeah.

18:29.209 --> 18:32.443
We talked, and everything's okay.
Yeah.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.978
Thank gosh. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.613
Hey, easy, all right. Okay.
Okay, there he is.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.814
Everybody's...

18:36.816 --> 18:38.616
Whoa, mother,
I'm right here.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.952
Hey.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.054
Are you hugging them

18:43.056 --> 18:44.088
while they're making out?

18:44.090 --> 18:45.456
Yes, uh, that is weird.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.258
Thank you for saying that.
Please let go of me.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.026
I'm not interested in this.
Let go of me.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.329
Did that wall fall down?

18:51.331 --> 18:52.763
Just please don't leave again.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.366
Yeah, about that.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.270
Well... this is it.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.471
Since you won't be able

19:00.473 --> 19:01.606
to contact me for a month,

19:01.608 --> 19:02.673
I've left a complementary bowl

19:02.675 --> 19:05.009
of advice. For instance, um,

19:05.011 --> 19:07.578
"Nick, stop doing that."

19:07.580 --> 19:10.014
(chuckles)
Just applies to everything.

19:10.016 --> 19:11.415
That's what's up.
That's what's up.

19:11.417 --> 19:12.617
E'r'day, e'r'day.

19:12.619 --> 19:13.918
Nick, stop doing that.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.153
NICK:
That's what's up.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.788
(sighs)

19:17.790 --> 19:19.423
It's gonna be a long month.
I'm gonna pace myself.

19:19.425 --> 19:20.491
I'm gonna miss you.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.260
(laughs)

19:22.262 --> 19:23.761
Don't worry.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.163
I'm gonna keep them
in line for you.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.664
No, you can't hit them.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.099
Even if it's for
their benefit?

19:28.101 --> 19:30.101
Yeah.
Okay.

19:30.103 --> 19:31.502
I got you a little something.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.271
It's just to trade with.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.939
There's currency in there.
I don't know.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.807
Oh, that's so sweet, Nick.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.877
Um, but you know I'm not going
to prison, right?

19:39.879 --> 19:41.712
As long as you're free right
here, you're never in prison.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.181
I bought you this burner

19:43.183 --> 19:44.182
from an unmarked storefront
in Koreatown.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.983
I believe it's small enough

19:45.985 --> 19:47.385
to conceal in the waistband
of your underpants.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.719
Oh, thank you, but...

19:48.721 --> 19:50.054
It's four walls.
They can't hold you, though.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.656
Make friends with big ladies.

19:51.658 --> 19:52.690
Keep your head up.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.192
(chuckles) Okay.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.194
Make sure to put, uh, toilet
tissue down on the toilet seat.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.662
Never sleep.
Thanks.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.630
Make your toothbrush into a shiv.
Everything's a weapon.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.633
See, hate put you in there,
but love gonna bust you out.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.635
Don't be afraid to put two
layers of toilet tissue down.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.583
(laughter)
SCHMIDT: Let's do it.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.718
Let's get into this
and see what sage wisdom

20:20.720 --> 20:22.186
Jess has for us.

20:22.188 --> 20:23.254
"No biting."

20:23.256 --> 20:24.255
That's a reminder for me.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.256
Mm-hmm.
Wow.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.325
Ew, "No more poop pranks"?

20:27.327 --> 20:28.826
Oh, yeah, those get
out of hand quickly.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.561
That was a
disgusting February.

20:30.563 --> 20:33.531
"If the shish kebob falls
before I come back, Nick wins.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.566
If it falls after,
Schmidt wins"?

20:35.568 --> 20:36.934
Hi-ya!
Is that... Oh.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.536
(laughter)

20:38.538 --> 20:40.504
Check it out, shish kebob.
Check it out, yeah.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.173
That's super gross.

20:42.175 --> 20:44.675
"Schmidt's allowed to request
that you do his back

20:44.677 --> 20:46.577
with sunscreen once a week."

20:46.579 --> 20:48.679
Actually, can someone
do that now?

20:48.681 --> 20:50.014
It's nighttime.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.382
"Boys' shorts should at most

20:51.384 --> 20:53.918
rise six inches
above the knee."

20:53.920 --> 20:55.786
Yeah, but where does the knee begin?
Right... here.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.922
You know, she never specifies
where the knee should begin.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.123
That's your knee, okay?

20:59.125 --> 21:00.558
This is the knee? Yes. Yes.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.693
"Stop harassing Beck."
Absolutely not.

21:02.695 --> 21:03.894
He cut you off
on the freeway.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.129
That's for you?
Yeah.

21:05.131 --> 21:06.931
CECE:
Yeah, makes sense.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.866
"Tell Schmidt not to sing 'Rent'
in the shower.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.301
We're in a drought."

21:10.303 --> 21:14.071
♪ Five thousand, 2,500,
600 minutes ♪

21:14.073 --> 21:16.307
Okay.
WINSTON: Those aren't the words.

21:16.309 --> 21:17.642
"Stop reading this

21:17.644 --> 21:19.944
within the first three hours
of my absence."

21:19.946 --> 21:21.912
Whoa.
Holy mackerel.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.347
How did she know?

21:24.317 --> 21:26.317
"Because I know everything."

21:27.820 --> 21:29.754
That's super scary, right?
Is she still here?

21:29.756 --> 21:31.222
(laughs)
I'm just messing with you.

21:31.224 --> 21:32.390
It says "Smile more."

21:32.392 --> 21:33.591
Oh, that's nice.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.993
Oh, damn it!
Oh, yes! Yes!

21:35.995 --> 21:38.996
