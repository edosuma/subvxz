Yeah, well, that's Miami.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.447
Yeah, yeah.

01:53.364 --> 01:56.159
You gotta hook me up with a meal sometime.
Introduce me around.

01:56.367 --> 01:59.871
After today, man, we-- We don't--
We don't know each other, okay?

02:01.205 --> 02:06.628
Just relax, man. Relax. You have no balls,
you have no fun, you know?

02:22.101 --> 02:23.394
What did I say?

02:23.603 --> 02:26.397
I-- I told you I don't need these.

02:28.191 --> 02:30.401
Did you--? Did you lose your virginity
wearing a condom?

02:30.610 --> 02:32.278
Is that what happened to you?

02:35.615 --> 02:37.992
Come on, man, just relax. Relax.

02:38.201 --> 02:40.536
The car's gonna be there
waiting for you when you come out.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.789
Nothing to worry about, okay?

02:42.955 --> 02:44.457
-Five minutes.
-Yes, sir.

02:44.582 --> 02:47.835
-Out front.
-Yeah. Be right there for you, okay?

02:49.504 --> 02:51.964
Now let's go pop that cherry
of yours now.

02:57.428 --> 02:59.180
You gonna wait for me till I'm done?

02:59.847 --> 03:01.516
Yeah, look, I'm telling you, I know Carol.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.434
I'll come in and say something nice
for you.

03:03.518 --> 03:06.145
I think I can get a job washing dishes

03:06.312 --> 03:07.814
Fine, go ahead.

03:08.398 --> 03:10.650
Let me see that résumé.

03:13.820 --> 03:18.699
It's strangely comforting to know
that I'm not the only one that you lie to.

03:18.825 --> 03:20.159
-What do you mean?
-What do I mean?

03:20.284 --> 03:21.911
You never worked at any of these places.

03:22.036 --> 03:25.415
Stop feeding me that crap. I know where
you've been the last couple of years.

03:25.498 --> 03:28.751
I know the schools, I know the jobs,
I know the shelters.

03:29.419 --> 03:32.880
Now, whatever you're up to, whatever
else you're hiding, I'm watching you.

03:33.506 --> 03:34.424
Clear?

03:36.008 --> 03:37.593
Crystal.

03:40.388 --> 03:43.558

-Let's drop him off at the spot, huh?
-Yeah, all right. Let's do that.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.354
You motherfucker--

05:15.316 --> 05:16.150
Please, don't.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.694

I've seen guys like you before.

05:19.195 --> 05:20.404
-You're not a dealer.
-Please.

05:20.571 --> 05:23.783

-Please, God, no! Please, please, please.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.334
Hey, kid. What's the word?

05:33.417 --> 05:35.253
Here's all the shit you asked for.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.296
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.427
-You hear anything?
-No.

05:43.636 --> 05:46.138
-Anyone talking about me?
-No.

05:46.347 --> 05:49.267
John? He's not saying anything
about your dad's case? Nothing?

05:49.392 --> 05:51.852
Bro, they don't talk about it with me.
Why the fuck would they?

05:52.728 --> 05:55.439
His brother got fucking killed.
You'd think he'd give a shit.

05:55.606 --> 05:59.277
I don't know what you think I'm gonna find
over there, but it ain't gonna happen.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.530
All right, just keep your ears open.
You want?

06:02.697 --> 06:04.073
-Here.
-Thanks.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.616
Yeah.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.373
You got more cash?

06:13.499 --> 06:14.584
You spent it all.

06:15.126 --> 06:19.213
Mm. All right. You got a pen?

06:21.215 --> 06:23.050
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.430
Gonna need you to do me something.

06:27.638 --> 06:30.349
I need you to be
ultra fucking careful, okay?

06:31.392 --> 06:33.436
I need you to deliver this.

07:04.508 --> 07:05.635
Hello?

07:07.303 --> 07:09.055
No, no, that's all right.

07:10.056 --> 07:11.265
What?

07:11.557 --> 07:13.643
-Honey?
-It's nothing, honey.

07:13.851 --> 07:15.394
Go back to sleep.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.645
<i>Belle, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I haven't found his truck yet.</i>

07:57.812 --> 08:00.481
I keep calling his cell,
it just goes straight to voicemail.

08:00.940 --> 08:03.150
Well, look, he's done this before.

08:03.234 --> 08:07.613
I know, but I thought he'd finally get his
fucking act together with the baby coming.

08:07.822 --> 08:09.615
If he doesn't show up by morning,

08:09.699 --> 08:12.618
Diana's gonna come to your house
as soon as she gets the kids off, okay?

08:13.035 --> 08:14.996
Look, I don't mean to rope you into this.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.207
<i>Honey, you're not roping me into anything.</i>
<i>That's what family's for.</i>

08:19.083 --> 08:20.626
-<i>Okay.</i>
-All right.

08:20.835 --> 08:22.044
Okay.

08:31.262 --> 08:32.722
Shit.

08:33.889 --> 08:36.142
Well, it is Kevin we're talking about.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.936
Maybe he's sleeping it off somewhere.
Did you try the boatyard?

08:39.061 --> 08:42.440
I already looked, he's not there.
Look, can you check a few places for me?

08:42.648 --> 08:44.942
I'm on my way to the airport,
I need to get back.

08:45.317 --> 08:47.570
All right. All right,
you do what you need to do.

08:48.654 --> 08:52.033
-I can call some of his friends.
-All right, thanks.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.286
-Are you worried?
-<i>Not yet.</i>

08:55.911 --> 08:57.997
Like you said,
this is Kevin we're talking about.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.834
All right, let me make some calls.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.800
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey, there he is.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.302
Morning, Detective.

09:11.510 --> 09:13.387
I'm looking for my brother.
I went to the yard,

09:13.471 --> 09:15.056
everything's shut down. What's going on?

09:15.139 --> 09:19.643
Yeah, Kevin couldn't make payroll,
so everybody had to find other work.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.605
What the fuck are you talking about?

09:22.688 --> 09:24.982
You know me, I'm not
trying to start nothing, all right?

09:25.066 --> 09:29.570
But ever since Danny passed,
Kevin's been scrambling.

09:29.945 --> 09:32.823
Having a real hard time
keeping the business on track.

09:35.826 --> 09:37.703
When's the last time you talked to him?

09:37.787 --> 09:38.788
I talked to him yesterday.

09:38.996 --> 09:41.332
He called and said
that he raised some cash,

09:41.415 --> 09:45.586
and he was gonna dole out some--
A couple grand to everyone.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.885
- Yeah, Marco.
<i>- Hey, John.</i>

09:53.094 --> 09:55.679
Just got a call.
They found a body up near Manatee Bay.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.433
Got any details?

09:59.642 --> 10:02.144
A white male, 40s. No ID.

10:03.104 --> 10:04.647
Okay.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.861
Uh...

10:11.737 --> 10:13.656
-Thanks.
-Sure.

wanted to know something real bad.

11:48.292 --> 11:50.044

12:15.736 --> 12:16.946
Hey.

12:17.529 --> 12:20.532
I was just wondering if you were
hanging out with Kevin last night.

12:22.493 --> 12:24.203
Do you have any idea--?

12:24.286 --> 12:26.038
I'm sorry, hold on.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.876
What the fuck is going on?

12:38.258 --> 12:41.178
-Beautiful day.
-Yes, it is.

12:41.679 --> 12:43.973
I just wanted to remind you
about our bungalow.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.392
The shower still isn't working.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.560
-You said you'd send someone to fix it.
-I'm sorry.

12:48.644 --> 12:50.938
-That was bungalow--?
-Three.

12:51.355 --> 12:54.274
-I'll get maintenance right over there.
-Thank you.

12:57.403 --> 13:00.656
How was it meeting your new grandson?

13:01.448 --> 13:04.576
He's a lot like Danny was at that age.

13:05.285 --> 13:09.832
You think it was strange, him showing up
out of the blue? Timing and all?

13:11.083 --> 13:13.502
I think he wants to know about his father.

13:16.005 --> 13:18.674
Maybe it's time for me
to be headed back home, Sally.

13:20.134 --> 13:23.178
Go, if... If you want.

13:24.096 --> 13:29.143
I'll stay. If there's more
you want me to do, but...

13:30.060 --> 13:31.603
But what?

13:33.272 --> 13:35.691
I've worked lots of cases,
you get to the end

13:35.774 --> 13:39.403
and the answer is not always
what you want it to be.

13:40.446 --> 13:41.780
What does that mean?

13:41.864 --> 13:45.826
Sometimes there isn't any light
at the end of the tunnel.

13:45.909 --> 13:51.665
Sometimes... all there is
is more darkness.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.962
And I don't want to see you hurt.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.885
I thought I was ready
to let this go, but...

14:05.429 --> 14:07.389
I saw that boy...

14:08.348 --> 14:12.019
that face, and I wonder.

14:14.146 --> 14:15.064
Wonder what?

14:16.190 --> 14:18.817
What else does my grandson know?

14:32.706 --> 14:34.458
You're late, asshole.

14:41.632 --> 14:43.967
What happened to your other wheels?

14:44.176 --> 14:46.387
That shit was just attracting
way too much pussy.

14:47.346 --> 14:49.056
-This one smells like dick.
-Hey!

14:51.058 --> 14:53.602
Watch it, pincushion.

14:53.811 --> 14:56.438
This car once belonged to your father.

14:56.605 --> 14:58.357
Didn't know he owned a car.

14:59.233 --> 15:03.112
Well, there's a lot of shit
you don't know about your dad.

15:03.445 --> 15:05.239
<i>Hey, hey, hey! I'm over here.</i>

15:05.447 --> 15:07.491
Okay, get down! Get on the goddamn floor.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.493
Get back, get down.
Get down on the floor.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.036
On the floor. Face down, hands down.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.996
Ma'am, you can stay there.
Leave your bag there.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.373
Drop your--

15:17.918 --> 15:19.086
- You, get up.
- No.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.671
-Get up. Get up.
-No. Please.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.006
Get up! Get the fuck up.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.677
Stay there. Sit up on the chair.

15:26.885 --> 15:30.139
Okay, nothing stupid, people.
I have a hostage.

15:30.431 --> 15:32.766
Are you gonna be the one that kills her?
Is it gonna be you?

15:33.475 --> 15:35.018
Good, we're on the same page, so...

15:35.519 --> 15:39.648
I-- I need the lockbox,
I need everything in it, the Oxy-- Don't.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.567
Everything you got, okay?

15:41.775 --> 15:43.527
Every goddamn pill.

15:43.735 --> 15:46.405
-Don't tell me you don't have the key.
-It's in my pocket.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.157
Okay, fucking go. Use it. Go.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.409
Go, go, go!

15:58.250 --> 16:00.711
-Are you okay?
-Get in quick.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.339
It's a little-- Kind of hard to explain.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.176
Have you talked to Belle?
She's freaking out.

16:07.259 --> 16:11.972
Yeah, well, Belle's not your problem,
okay? My marriage is not your problem.

16:13.432 --> 16:14.683
-What?
-Are you high?

16:14.808 --> 16:16.560
-No, I'm not fucking high!
-Yes, you are.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.686
-I am not!
-What are you on?

16:17.769 --> 16:19.730
Hey, did you tell anybody I was here?

16:19.938 --> 16:22.024
No. What the fuck is going on?

16:22.691 --> 16:25.527
-I don't know what to do, Meg.
-About what?

16:30.073 --> 16:32.409
Oh, God.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.787
Oh, God. I don't know what to fucking do.

16:36.121 --> 16:38.040
Oh, God.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.210
-Shit.
-Oh, fuck,

16:41.293 --> 16:43.795
-fuck, fuck!
-All right, all right. What happened?

16:44.004 --> 16:45.422
Thanks, Chase. Bye.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.382
Hey, we got a hit on the body.

16:47.466 --> 16:50.802
Pete Zakyian, a small-time shithead
from Miami.

16:50.886 --> 16:53.639
-Deals coke in Liberty City.
-What's he doing down here?

16:54.056 --> 16:55.766
Looking for new business opportunities?

16:56.850 --> 16:58.852
-Maybe he's trying--
-What?

17:00.020 --> 17:02.064
I gotta take this.

17:02.314 --> 17:04.149
Hey, did you find him?

17:05.859 --> 17:08.487
You able to bring the thing
we talked about?

17:13.825 --> 17:17.037
Yeah, I got it right here.

17:18.956 --> 17:21.375
Right here. There she is, right there.

17:31.385 --> 17:34.179
How long you gonna hide out
in this shitbox?

17:35.430 --> 17:39.226
As long as it takes for me to get straight
with the fuckers who wanna hurt me.

17:39.601 --> 17:40.602
What about you?

17:42.563 --> 17:44.064
When are you heading back?

17:46.316 --> 17:47.859
I'm not.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.028
-Really?
-Nope.

17:50.445 --> 17:56.577
Just think I'm gonna hang out down here
a couple days, poke around a little bit.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.582
For what?

18:01.873 --> 18:05.752
All that shit you told me that went down
with Danny at the motel...

18:07.713 --> 18:10.173
Well, that sounded very, very interesting.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.385
Interesting how?

18:14.761 --> 18:18.265
Well, a cop sees somebody
coming after his own brother...

18:19.099 --> 18:21.351
and then he doesn't do anything
about that?

18:21.893 --> 18:25.731
I don't know, that-- That sounds like
some out-there shit to me.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.692
Oh. What's that got to do with you?

18:29.818 --> 18:31.987
I don't know.
I know how to sniff out opportunity.

18:33.447 --> 18:34.781
Uh-huh.

18:36.742 --> 18:40.412
The question is, how come you didn't
take that information to the cops?

18:40.621 --> 18:43.290
John Rayburn is the fucking cops.

18:44.082 --> 18:48.086
And I've broken my parole a hundred
fucking fifty different ways, so...

18:48.629 --> 18:49.880
no one's gonna listen to me.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.887
Why do you give a shit about any of this?

19:01.767 --> 19:04.519
I got my own thing with the Rayburns.

19:25.332 --> 19:28.710
I don't know them, I just--
I needed some money, all right? So...

19:28.794 --> 19:31.254
So, you what? What did--? What did you do?

19:32.005 --> 19:34.758
Oh, God!

19:35.300 --> 19:37.010
- You have to tell him.
- Tell me what?

19:37.094 --> 19:39.596
John, I'm so sorry. It was so stupid.

19:40.222 --> 19:45.143
-I'm such a fucking asshole.
-He made a deal with these guys.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.857
What kind of deal?

19:55.153 --> 19:56.279
Are you gonna tell him?

20:00.784 --> 20:03.704
Do you remember the suitcases
that we moved from the inn when we--

20:03.787 --> 20:06.331
When we got rid of Danny's stuff?

20:10.961 --> 20:12.379
Yeah, I remember, Kevin.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.340
I kept some.

20:20.053 --> 20:23.140
I'm so sorry, dude. I wasn't thinking.
I'm fucked up.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.600
I'm sor...

20:28.270 --> 20:31.064
-Do you have any idea what you've done?
-Yeah. I fucked up.

20:31.148 --> 20:32.482
I-- I'm sorry.

20:32.691 --> 20:35.736
Because of you, whoever you made a deal
with, that guy may be dead right now.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.863
What the fuck are you talking about?
That guy--

20:38.071 --> 20:40.240
Those guys tried to kill me, man.

20:41.283 --> 20:44.077
-What happened?
-They-- I'm in my truck.

20:44.369 --> 20:47.164
He fucking opened the door,
he Tasered the shit out of me,

20:47.581 --> 20:48.790
they fucked around with a gun,

20:48.874 --> 20:50.459
-then took off.
-Anybody know it was you?

20:50.584 --> 20:52.169
-I never used my name.
-Anybody ID you?

20:52.377 --> 20:53.587
-No.
-Nobody could ID you?

20:53.670 --> 20:57.924
No. It was those two guys. The main guy
and then the taller one, and that's it.

20:58.341 --> 20:59.509
I swear to God.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.511
What about the football player
on the yacht?

21:01.720 --> 21:03.638
And the football player on the yacht.

21:03.847 --> 21:06.308
Just those three. That's it.

21:06.683 --> 21:08.643
And a waitress. Fuck.

21:08.769 --> 21:10.604
There's a waitress.

21:11.062 --> 21:13.023
And then maybe a couple cops. I don't...

21:13.106 --> 21:15.609
I don't-- I can't remember, man.

21:15.692 --> 21:18.737
- Jesus Christ.
- Fuck.

21:21.239 --> 21:24.367
-God!
-He's been using.

21:33.752 --> 21:35.504
How long you been using?

21:38.507 --> 21:39.925
I don't know.

21:40.383 --> 21:42.010
Since Danny.

21:58.318 --> 22:01.613
Does anybody else know that you're here?
Either of you?

22:01.696 --> 22:03.740
-No.
-Good. Good.

22:03.824 --> 22:04.991
- You stay here.
- Okay.

22:05.075 --> 22:05.951
-You understand?
-Yeah.

22:06.034 --> 22:09.621
You're gonna stay here, and you're
not gonna make contact with anyone.

22:09.704 --> 22:10.705
-All right.
-You got that?

22:10.789 --> 22:12.874
-Understood?
-I understand.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.335
Come here. Come here.

22:15.418 --> 22:18.588
Come here. It's gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

22:18.672 --> 22:20.757
-Come here.
-I'm fucking scared, man.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.719
-I'm fucking scared.
-It's gonna be all right.

22:33.603 --> 22:36.189
Hey. Hey, John, wait.

22:36.273 --> 22:39.776
-What are we supposed to do?
-Do you realize what that idiot did?

22:39.901 --> 22:42.988
He put Wayne Lowry's drugs back out
on the street. One person is already dead.

22:43.113 --> 22:45.198
Why is Lowry an issue?
He's supposed to be in jail.

22:45.282 --> 22:47.534
I'm working on that.

22:47.701 --> 22:50.829
I'll tell you what, why don't you just
keep him in the goddamn hotel room?

22:50.912 --> 22:52.998
That's your job, okay?

23:00.005 --> 23:02.007
Thanks for calling me back.

23:02.215 --> 23:07.262
Well, I'm always up for a free meal,
but I already told you what I know.

23:07.971 --> 23:10.765
Ah. Sometimes people forget things.

23:11.016 --> 23:14.394
Your dad owed money to some people
in Miami. You know anything about that?

23:16.313 --> 23:18.607
No, I wasn't around much.

23:19.274 --> 23:24.487
When you saw John and Kevin go into
your dad's apartment... I'm curious.

23:24.696 --> 23:26.906
Do you remember anything else about that?

23:30.160 --> 23:32.996
-I've got a question for you.
-What's that?

23:33.079 --> 23:36.875
If you're so fucking curious,
then why not ask John yourself?

23:40.962 --> 23:42.589
You remind me of your dad.

23:43.131 --> 23:46.176
I knew him, you know, when he was a kid.
Younger than you.

23:46.384 --> 23:48.970
I always felt like the cards
were stacked against him.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.306
Are you shitting me?

23:52.140 --> 23:56.061
You see that place he grew up?
He had a sweet deal.

23:56.269 --> 24:00.440
Mother, father, sisters, brothers.
One big, happy family.

24:02.192 --> 24:04.277
You think you got dealt a bum hand?

24:05.362 --> 24:07.447
You found me in a youth shelter.

24:09.574 --> 24:11.868
Didn't answer the question.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.495
Which one?

24:13.662 --> 24:18.792
When you saw your uncle John, your uncle
Kevin go into the apartment in Miami,

24:19.042 --> 24:22.420
did you tell me everything about that?

24:27.676 --> 24:30.220
I've been doing this for a long time, son.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.741
What do you want?

24:54.577 --> 24:56.287
We need to talk.

24:57.414 --> 24:58.248
Why?

25:02.085 --> 25:04.212
Your brother is in a shitload of trouble.

25:05.797 --> 25:08.049
Well, that's his problem, isn't it?

25:08.341 --> 25:12.554
You can act like you don't care
about him, but I'm not buying that.

25:18.435 --> 25:20.353
What are you doing here, John?

25:20.437 --> 25:23.440
I came in, I answered all your questions.

25:34.325 --> 25:35.827
Listen.

25:38.329 --> 25:42.917
This investigation... It-It's all ongoing.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.591
I need to know if you've heard from Eric.

25:51.634 --> 25:54.053
I told you I'd call if he contacted me.

25:54.471 --> 25:58.641
-Maybe it slipped your mind.
-I haven't spoken to him.

26:04.147 --> 26:09.778
The people that your brother has been
working with, they're bad fucking people.

26:09.986 --> 26:11.946
And they are desperate right now.

26:12.030 --> 26:14.991
If they find him before I do,
I don't know what's gonna happen.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.452
But if he comes to me first,
I can protect him.

26:19.537 --> 26:21.456
Like you protected Danny?

26:35.512 --> 26:38.598
You know, you and Eric
were Danny's only real friends.

26:41.726 --> 26:46.731
If he comes to me... I promise
I'll do everything I can to help.

26:50.902 --> 26:52.529
These guys...

26:55.323 --> 26:56.908
they want Eric dead, don't they?

27:00.203 --> 27:02.831
They'll do anything they have to.

27:05.542 --> 27:09.254
I don't know where he is, but...
someone might.

27:12.715 --> 27:14.926
Listen, Belle-- Belle, I'm okay. I'm fine.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.719
- I'm fine.
<i>- Tell me what's going on.</i>

27:16.803 --> 27:19.639
I-- I-- But that's all I can tell you
right now.

27:19.931 --> 27:23.017
I'm so sorry, and I love you, honey.

27:23.601 --> 27:25.895
And I want you to know something.

27:30.024 --> 27:33.653
-She hung up on me.
-Can you blame her?

27:39.409 --> 27:42.453
Meg, how could I know
Lowry would find that stuff?

27:42.537 --> 27:44.956
No, you shouldn't have been doing it
in the first place.

27:45.456 --> 27:46.624
I needed the money.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.710
No. We all agreed you could
use the inn for a loan.

27:48.793 --> 27:51.546
I know, but my business is going under.

27:51.754 --> 27:52.964
So, you decide to deal drugs?

27:54.340 --> 27:57.385
How the fuck does that even happen, Kevin?

28:02.098 --> 28:04.559
I thought things would go back to normal.

28:06.769 --> 28:08.438
I can't sleep.

28:09.772 --> 28:11.149
I can't eat.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.863
I'm so fucking tired.

28:18.573 --> 28:21.242
Lying to Belle, lying to Mom...

28:24.078 --> 28:26.998
You know, I never realized it
until you left.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.918
You were the one I used to talk to.

28:31.878 --> 28:33.796
When I was in trouble...

28:35.590 --> 28:36.799
I'd come to you.

28:38.051 --> 28:39.677
But now...

28:41.429 --> 28:42.680
Okay, so it's my fault?

28:43.848 --> 28:46.100
I take a job and your life
goes off the rails?

28:46.309 --> 28:48.978
-No, I didn't say that.
-Why don't you just say nothing?

28:50.355 --> 28:51.356
Please.

28:57.278 --> 28:59.447
Yeah, just waiting
for some of my food to be ready.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.449
Thank you.

29:02.116 --> 29:03.243
Oh, yeah.

29:03.534 --> 29:05.328
Oh, it could be a good thing here.

29:08.581 --> 29:10.208
Oh, a real good thing.

29:10.375 --> 29:14.295
Come on. Come on, come on, hurry up.
Just throw them all in there.

29:18.299 --> 29:19.801
- Fucking move--
- Honey, I'm home.

29:19.884 --> 29:21.469
What the--

29:22.095 --> 29:24.389
Oh, man, what the fuck?
What are you doing?

29:24.555 --> 29:26.849
Just a little one-stop shopping,
baby, that's all.

29:27.016 --> 29:29.352
All right, everybody.
No alarms, no cell phones.

29:29.519 --> 29:31.312
You get clever, people,
you're gonna get hurt.

29:31.479 --> 29:33.815
All right, who's got--
Who can open the register for me?

29:34.232 --> 29:36.401
- I-- I can.
- All right, then get up. Get up.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.528
-You hear me?
-Don't do this, man. Come on.

29:38.695 --> 29:41.781
Up, up, up, up, up, up.
And no funny business.

29:41.948 --> 29:45.159
-You get clever, you're gonna get hurt.
-Zip it up, zip it up.

29:45.326 --> 29:47.787
We can go now.
We got this shit, let's go.

29:47.954 --> 29:50.915
Come on, man.
I want the whole register.

29:51.833 --> 29:57.338
-We gotta go.
-Relax. I wanna browse a few more items.

30:18.026 --> 30:19.986
Come on, get in!

30:23.781 --> 30:25.533
Fuck you.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.861
Where are these two dipshits?

31:02.570 --> 31:05.990
We've got one of them tucked away.

31:06.157 --> 31:08.785
I'm afraid the other one
is no longer with us.

31:09.410 --> 31:11.454
What'd they have to say?

31:11.621 --> 31:14.082
Those two assholes
rolled some punk last night,

31:14.248 --> 31:16.542
took two keys off him,
then tried to sell it to us.

31:16.709 --> 31:20.588
The problem is, it was already ours.

31:20.797 --> 31:24.092
They were selling product
you say was lost.

31:25.676 --> 31:27.387
That's impossible.

31:27.553 --> 31:28.971
Who did they take it from?

31:29.263 --> 31:30.473
Some local.

31:30.640 --> 31:33.601
They don't know him,
they just fucked him up and left him.

31:33.684 --> 31:36.312
So, now it's your job to find him.

31:36.479 --> 31:38.689
And how the fuck
am I supposed to do that?

31:38.856 --> 31:41.150
It's your backyard, amigo.

31:41.317 --> 31:42.693
Find him.

31:42.860 --> 31:45.738
Or this partnership will be dissolved.

31:46.697 --> 31:48.491
This makes no sense.

31:48.658 --> 31:51.911
The DEA confiscated our whole load.

31:54.789 --> 31:57.291
Then how is the product
out on the street?

31:59.252 --> 32:03.214
Unless someone skimmed
before the DEA got it.

32:04.507 --> 32:06.759
I don't like what you're implying.

32:11.055 --> 32:12.890
Then do something about it,

32:13.057 --> 32:15.351
or I fucking will.

32:19.230 --> 32:21.315
I'll find the guy.

32:38.541 --> 32:40.251
-Bye, dude. Thank you.
-See you.

33:05.693 --> 33:07.028
Hey.

33:09.155 --> 33:12.366
Why don't you keep your hands up
where I can see them, please?

33:17.705 --> 33:19.123
Sally?

33:19.290 --> 33:20.291
What are you doing?

33:20.458 --> 33:24.545
Oh, I was just looking at these hibiscus
for the inn.

33:24.712 --> 33:27.048
We could certainly use some color.

33:27.215 --> 33:30.051
All right.
Do you want me to help you with it?

33:33.262 --> 33:35.681
What's up? What's on your mind?

33:36.933 --> 33:39.810
I need to ask you a few questions,
Diana.

33:40.978 --> 33:43.689
I'm just trying to understand.

33:44.232 --> 33:48.569
It was a lot of... chaos when Danny died.

33:48.653 --> 33:51.072
I'm still sorting things out.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.698
Yeah.

33:54.242 --> 33:57.787
Of course.
I mean, I can't even imagine.

33:58.079 --> 34:01.457
I know John sent
you and the kids away.

34:02.542 --> 34:07.046
Did he ever talk about what happened here
while you were gone?

34:09.465 --> 34:14.136
Just that-- I mean, obviously I knew
Danny was in some kind of trouble

34:14.303 --> 34:17.640
and that John was doing his best
to find him.

34:20.434 --> 34:24.063
Did he tell you that he went
to Danny's apartment in Miami?

34:27.775 --> 34:30.528
No? Apparently he went with Kevin.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.489
He never told me.

34:36.450 --> 34:39.453
I'm sure he had a good reason
for not telling us.

34:43.874 --> 34:46.210
What's bothering you, Sally?

34:47.587 --> 34:49.005
I wanna know what happened
to my son.

34:49.088 --> 34:52.049
And I don't think John is giving me
the whole story.

34:55.511 --> 34:58.556
Please know I'm not trying
to be insensitive with this, but...

35:01.142 --> 35:03.853
Danny threatened our kids.

35:04.812 --> 35:06.606
Yeah, I know. That's what John thinks.

35:06.772 --> 35:09.233
No, Sally.

35:09.400 --> 35:10.651
That happened.

35:10.818 --> 35:12.361
You need to know that.

35:12.862 --> 35:14.822
I never said it didn't.

35:14.905 --> 35:16.198
Da--

35:16.282 --> 35:18.659
Danny was way out of control
in the end.

35:18.826 --> 35:21.203
He was dangerous. So, I--

35:21.996 --> 35:24.081
I'm sorry, but I-- I just feel like

35:24.248 --> 35:27.668
you could have more concern for
the rest of your family in all of this.

35:27.835 --> 35:29.378
You always disliked Danny.

35:29.545 --> 35:30.963
That's not true.

35:32.214 --> 35:34.216
I gave him so many chances.

35:34.383 --> 35:38.387
We lent him money, he stayed with us.
I continued to want the best for him,

35:38.554 --> 35:40.848
and he just-- He resented me.

35:43.142 --> 35:44.894
He disrespected us, Sally.

35:45.728 --> 35:49.190
And he disrespected you and Robert,
you know he did.

35:49.357 --> 35:52.485
Everything in this family
has been about Danny for so long.

35:52.652 --> 35:54.153
We didn't do right by him.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.572
-None of us did.
-Sally, those are excuses.

35:57.531 --> 36:01.577
Everybody has issues with their family,
and not everybody turns into Danny.

36:07.541 --> 36:10.252
You don't know what it's like,
losing a child.

36:12.421 --> 36:15.925
-I hope you never do.
-Sally. Please. Please, just--

36:16.092 --> 36:18.177
Thank you for the tea.

36:40.616 --> 36:42.410
What the fuck we doing here?

36:47.790 --> 36:49.583
You arresting me?

36:54.088 --> 36:57.633
When that guy came over to your house
looking for Danny...

36:58.718 --> 36:59.885
what happened?

37:01.303 --> 37:04.223
He cold-cocked me,
then he kicked the shit out of me.

37:04.390 --> 37:06.934
And then you gave up the motel
that Danny was staying at.

37:07.435 --> 37:10.771
It must have felt real shitty,
betraying my brother like that.

37:14.191 --> 37:16.944
Yeah, and then when you ran off
to save yourself,

37:17.319 --> 37:18.946
where did you go?

37:19.655 --> 37:21.657
I went to the shithole you found me in.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.327
How do you know Nolan?

37:27.830 --> 37:28.831
Fuck you, John.

37:32.626 --> 37:34.754
Wayne Lowry wants you dead.

37:35.337 --> 37:36.756
You know that?

37:37.757 --> 37:42.094
If I let him know that you're in town...

37:44.388 --> 37:46.640
things would be very bad for you.

37:46.974 --> 37:49.018
Come on, John.

37:49.894 --> 37:51.312
Is this worth dying for?

37:51.479 --> 37:53.814
What? You wanna know the kid--

37:53.981 --> 37:56.150
Danny didn't know what the fuck
was gonna happen to him

37:56.233 --> 37:57.485
so he gave me the kid's number.

37:57.651 --> 38:01.739
Okay? Just in case,
he wanted me to look out for the kid.

38:02.072 --> 38:03.657
That's it.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.706
Yeah, I'm gonna give you
a very big break.

38:12.333 --> 38:15.419
I'll let you make it out of this alive...

38:16.378 --> 38:20.549
but you're gonna do absolutely everything
I tell you to do.

38:23.344 --> 38:24.887
Fuck you.

38:28.432 --> 38:30.059
Where we going?

38:30.684 --> 38:32.353
Where the fuck are we going?

38:33.604 --> 38:36.190
-I gotta get out of here.
-You're not going anywhere.

38:36.357 --> 38:38.234
I gotta see Belle.

38:38.400 --> 38:42.404
I just missed my plane for you.
You're not going anywhere. Sit down.

38:44.740 --> 38:46.492
God.

38:54.917 --> 38:56.418
I'm sorry you missed your plane.

39:05.469 --> 39:06.887
You like your new job?

39:07.054 --> 39:10.015
-Yeah, I do.
-Yeah?

39:10.349 --> 39:12.309
It's good to be away, I bet, huh?

39:12.476 --> 39:13.811
You have no idea.

39:13.978 --> 39:15.020
No, I don't.

39:16.105 --> 39:17.857
I'm still here.

39:18.691 --> 39:21.861
-Reminders everywhere.
-Don't talk about it, please.

39:24.238 --> 39:26.949
I'm sorry that I'm not here, okay?

39:29.451 --> 39:31.745
You think I don't feel guilty about that?

39:32.955 --> 39:34.707
I can't be.

39:38.460 --> 39:42.047
In New York, I go to work,
I do my job, it's very simple.

39:43.382 --> 39:45.092
By the way, no one knows I'm here.

39:45.259 --> 39:47.928
Not Mom, no one else,
and I'd like to keep it that way.

39:48.095 --> 39:49.638
Okay.

39:49.847 --> 39:51.557
I understand.

39:54.351 --> 39:57.521
I know we used to talk, Kevin,
and maybe someday we will again.

39:57.688 --> 40:01.442
But right now
I just need to take care of myself.

40:01.901 --> 40:03.277
Okay.

40:14.955 --> 40:17.082
Are you gonna give them
what they want?

40:20.085 --> 40:22.087
Tell them about Lowry?

40:29.094 --> 40:30.512
He killed your best friend.

40:39.396 --> 40:42.483
You don't wanna talk to me? Fine.

40:45.361 --> 40:47.738
You think I sold you out? Fine.

40:49.323 --> 40:52.701
You don't want to consider that maybe,
just maybe, I'm worried about you?

40:59.833 --> 41:01.543
You know what? Fuck you, Eric.

41:04.880 --> 41:07.633
You've never taken responsibility
for anything, why start now?

41:07.716 --> 41:09.677
Chelsea.

41:11.595 --> 41:14.682
There's a lot about this
that you don't know.

41:14.848 --> 41:16.809
I don't wanna know.

41:16.976 --> 41:18.394
I just wanna live my life.

41:21.563 --> 41:24.149
-What happened to Danny--
-Was Danny's own fault.

41:24.316 --> 41:27.277
He made a lot of stupid decisions.

41:28.445 --> 41:30.906
I hope you're gonna be smarter
than he was.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.579
Hey, uh...

41:41.333 --> 41:42.626
how's Mom doing?

41:42.793 --> 41:45.170
-How's Mom?
-Yeah.

41:45.337 --> 41:46.755
She's dying.

41:47.923 --> 41:51.260
She's on an oxygen tank
and a tube in her nose.

41:51.635 --> 41:54.555
So, tell me, is she ever gonna
see her son alive again?

41:58.225 --> 42:02.187
She gonna have to read about you
lying dead in a ditch somewhere?

42:13.532 --> 42:14.783
He'll do what you want.

42:15.617 --> 42:17.036
Thank you.

42:54.573 --> 42:56.200
We need to talk.

43:05.584 --> 43:07.961
I found Eric O'Bannon.

43:09.254 --> 43:10.631
He's willing to give you up.

43:11.465 --> 43:12.758
He doesn't know shit.

43:12.925 --> 43:15.302
No? He can tie the drugs on you...

43:16.512 --> 43:19.056
on those girls that burned
on that boat...

43:20.933 --> 43:22.184
and maybe even Danny.

43:22.351 --> 43:26.105
I already told you
I didn't kill your brother.

43:27.564 --> 43:29.483
You had something to do with it.

43:33.028 --> 43:34.822
-We're done here.
-Hey, Wayne.

43:34.988 --> 43:38.700
You know, the people that you work for,
they gotta be mighty pissed

43:38.784 --> 43:41.954
that your drugs are out on the street
right now.

43:42.037 --> 43:43.789
And Eric O'Bannon

43:43.956 --> 43:46.834
going and running his mouth
to the feds,

43:47.000 --> 43:48.919
that's not gonna make them
any happier.

43:49.128 --> 43:53.090
I mean, fuck, they're giving you
an awful lot of rope, aren't they?

43:53.924 --> 43:56.635
And eventually
they're gonna hang you with it.

44:00.681 --> 44:02.349
What do you want?

44:06.770 --> 44:08.355
I wanna be your lifeline.

44:08.522 --> 44:10.357
So, now you're gonna make me
an offer.

44:10.440 --> 44:12.401
How nice.

44:12.860 --> 44:14.862
What's on the table, Detective?

44:17.030 --> 44:21.451
-Twenty-five years.
-Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me.

44:22.619 --> 44:25.581
You give names,
you keep your nose clean...

44:26.707 --> 44:28.500
you will be out in ten.

44:28.667 --> 44:31.086
I give them up, I'm dead.

44:31.253 --> 44:32.629
Even in prison.

44:33.881 --> 44:35.883
It's a federal case.

44:36.466 --> 44:37.551
The government,

44:37.718 --> 44:39.803
they take care of their assets.

44:42.264 --> 44:45.642
They'll take care of your wife
and they will take care of your son.

44:48.061 --> 44:51.106
And in exchange
for this generous offer,

44:51.273 --> 44:52.900
you want your brother's tape.

44:57.446 --> 44:59.197
I'll think about it.

45:07.497 --> 45:08.999
<i>Come on.</i>

45:09.541 --> 45:12.210
-Come on, man, let's fucking go.
-Didn't I ask you not to?

45:12.377 --> 45:15.839
So, why'd you press it? Why?
Why the fuck did you press the alarm?

45:16.006 --> 45:17.674
Why'd you press the fucking alarm?

45:17.966 --> 45:20.802
I was afraid you were gonna kill somebody.

45:20.969 --> 45:22.262
Come on.

45:23.096 --> 45:24.848
What's wrong with you, you fucking--?

45:25.223 --> 45:26.433
Oh, Jesus.

45:27.351 --> 45:28.352
Oh, shit.

45:56.213 --> 45:57.965
How you doing?

45:59.549 --> 46:01.885
These assholes treating you okay?

46:03.011 --> 46:04.930
Yeah, Mom.

46:05.097 --> 46:07.057
The Rayburns are treating me just fine.

47:20.088 --> 47:22.340
-You leave the front door open?
-Hey, baby.

47:22.507 --> 47:25.177
Did you leave the front door open?

47:25.343 --> 47:26.636
No.

47:29.222 --> 47:31.016
Chris!

47:31.933 --> 47:34.352
You leave the front door open?

47:34.853 --> 47:35.937
You hear me?

47:36.104 --> 47:38.899
-Who left the front door open?
-Not me.

47:39.357 --> 47:42.402
What the hell did I tell you
about leaving doors open?

47:42.569 --> 47:43.862
Wayne, he said he didn't.

47:44.029 --> 47:47.574
You come in,
you lock the goddamn door.

47:47.741 --> 47:49.993
Wayne, what is wrong with you?

48:07.552 --> 48:10.347
What? Let me call you back.

48:11.264 --> 48:15.185
-What's up?
-I just got a call, Lowry's lawyer.

48:15.352 --> 48:16.937
He knew we had O'Bannon in custody.

48:18.897 --> 48:22.400
-Yeah?
-Lowry wants to propose a deal.

48:23.735 --> 48:25.987
Why the hell would he wanna turn
himself in now, huh?

48:27.405 --> 48:29.032
My guess, he's shitting his pants.

48:29.574 --> 48:32.619
Product's out on the street,
higher-ups can't be real happy about that.

48:32.911 --> 48:36.832
Yeah, well, I bet you could guess
how we'd feel about making a deal.

48:37.624 --> 48:39.292
He could get us the network.

48:39.459 --> 48:41.503
We could take down
half the Eastern seaboard.

48:42.712 --> 48:44.005
What is the deal?

48:44.631 --> 48:46.258
Lawyer offered up a 25-year bit.

48:47.968 --> 48:51.263
Yeah, what's he gonna serve?
Ten, 15 max?

48:51.429 --> 48:55.350
Look, even with O'Bannon,
our case is thin.

48:55.559 --> 48:58.395
Most of his testimony is hearsay.
This is a huge break for us.

48:58.562 --> 49:00.605
No, this is a huge break for you.

49:03.775 --> 49:05.569
John lost a brother.

49:07.779 --> 49:10.532
Is Lowry copping to the murder?

49:11.616 --> 49:14.494
No. Lawyer says we don't have enough
for that. And he's right, we don't.

49:14.661 --> 49:18.039
-So, why are we having this conversation?
-Say, what if we--

49:21.418 --> 49:24.504
We take this deal,
Danny's case goes cold.

49:24.880 --> 49:26.339
No one will pursue it.

49:26.506 --> 49:30.051
But the guy who did this
will be behind bars. And, John...

49:30.594 --> 49:32.429
that might be the best we get.

49:35.223 --> 49:36.683
I don't like it.

49:43.398 --> 49:45.984
But my family's been through enough.

49:50.530 --> 49:52.741
I'll agree to this deal...

49:53.533 --> 49:56.703
but only if you can give me your word
that you'll bring down that network.

49:56.786 --> 49:59.372
Because if you don't, this is all a waste.

50:01.333 --> 50:02.626
We'll get them.

50:03.418 --> 50:04.920
Thanks, John.

50:06.254 --> 50:07.380
John.

50:22.896 --> 50:25.357
Why the fuck
haven't we heard from John?

50:31.446 --> 50:33.240
Hey, maybe I can fix things with Lowry.

50:34.866 --> 50:37.661
-What are you talking about?
-I think I can get us out from under--

50:37.744 --> 50:39.788
-No. No.
-Meg.

50:39.955 --> 50:42.916
Listen to me.
John has done nothing, all right?

50:43.083 --> 50:45.877
Lowry is supposed to be in jail.
He's not.

50:46.044 --> 50:48.421
We're not supposed to be dealing
with Danny anymore.

50:48.588 --> 50:52.175
I need you to look at me, okay?
I need you to look at me right now.

50:52.342 --> 50:54.261
You are in no condition
to be offering solutions.

50:54.386 --> 50:57.847
You need to stay here
and focus on not making anything worse.

50:59.683 --> 51:01.101
Is that him?

51:01.726 --> 51:03.061
-Is it John?
-Shit.

51:03.228 --> 51:04.813
-What?
-Hi.

51:04.980 --> 51:06.606
-Who is it?
-It's work.

51:06.773 --> 51:08.650
You were supposed to be back today.

51:08.817 --> 51:13.613
I'm so sorry. I meant to call you.
We just had a family emergency.

51:14.364 --> 51:16.741
Meg, you missed the meeting.

51:16.825 --> 51:20.787
Uh... Yeah. Yeah, I know, the Pell case.

51:20.954 --> 51:24.874
I've been going over those depositions.
This family thing has been so tricky

51:24.958 --> 51:27.627
and I... It caught me by surprise.

51:28.295 --> 51:31.756
Okay, well, I really needed you
here today. I was counting on you.

51:32.799 --> 51:37.137
If I just could have one or two more days
just to be able to sort things out here.

51:37.554 --> 51:40.849
Okay, I don't understand.
Do you even want this job?

51:41.016 --> 51:44.394
Yes, I absolutely want the job.
I 100 percent want the job.

51:44.561 --> 51:46.688
I just... I promise you I will be there,
I just need--

51:53.945 --> 51:55.405
I have to call you back.

51:55.572 --> 51:56.948
Kevin!

51:57.866 --> 51:59.326
Kevin?

51:59.492 --> 52:01.619
Hey! Kevin, hey!

52:04.914 --> 52:06.374
Fuck!

52:08.585 --> 52:10.003
Fuck.

52:19.262 --> 52:21.848
Hey, Mom? Mom?

52:23.767 --> 52:26.936
Hey, John, I'm sorry to take
you away from your family.

52:27.020 --> 52:30.106
What the hell is going on?
Diana told me you and her had words.

52:30.565 --> 52:31.900
Yeah.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.069
Got a little heated.

52:35.320 --> 52:36.613
Is everything all right?

52:39.949 --> 52:42.827
When Danny first went missing,

52:42.994 --> 52:46.164
I asked Lenny Potts to look for him.

52:53.421 --> 52:54.839
And...

52:55.590 --> 52:57.926
he discovered some things.

53:00.345 --> 53:01.971
Things I found disturbing.

53:05.934 --> 53:08.561
Danny told us that he was moving
drugs through the inn,

53:08.728 --> 53:12.023
and I know the DEA
searched the property...

53:12.857 --> 53:14.734
but didn't find anything.

53:15.610 --> 53:18.196
And the day
before the pier dedication,

53:18.363 --> 53:22.033
you and Kevin went to Miami...

53:22.534 --> 53:24.452
to Danny's apartment.

53:28.540 --> 53:31.084
And you were carrying suitcases.

53:36.798 --> 53:38.716
Is that true?

53:42.095 --> 53:44.305
Oh, God, John.

53:47.016 --> 53:51.771
Why didn't you tell the police
about any of this?

53:56.985 --> 53:58.361
I...

54:03.158 --> 54:04.159
Listen to me.

54:08.079 --> 54:10.582
Let's say, hypothetically, Mom...

54:14.794 --> 54:16.880
before the DEA...

54:17.464 --> 54:22.218
came to the inn to search
for those drugs and arrest Danny...

54:24.304 --> 54:26.139
before that happened...

54:28.766 --> 54:30.310
I took them.

54:31.686 --> 54:36.399
Let's just say, hypothetically, the people
that were looking for Danny, Mom...

54:37.317 --> 54:42.697
and the near two million dollars in drugs
that he stole from these people...

54:47.911 --> 54:50.914
they were getting very, very close
to finding him.

54:51.372 --> 54:56.961
Can you think of any good reason why
I might take them to Danny's apartment?

55:03.384 --> 55:04.761
So...

55:07.096 --> 55:08.890
you were...

55:10.850 --> 55:14.020
giving the drugs back to Danny
so he could return them.

55:17.857 --> 55:19.734
That's one possibility,

55:19.901 --> 55:21.611
hypothetically.

55:23.196 --> 55:25.281
You risked your career...

55:27.909 --> 55:30.161
to protect your brother.

55:45.134 --> 55:47.804
You always looked out
for your brother...

55:49.305 --> 55:51.224
even to the end.

56:02.193 --> 56:04.362
I love you, Mama.
