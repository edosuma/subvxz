00:03.444 --> 00:04.945
at the time of detonation
has died.

00:05.063 --> 00:06.743
We know the money came
from Kredit Krepost,

00:06.764 --> 00:08.365
a private bank in Paris.

00:08.449 --> 00:10.033
It's run by Ivan Kravec.

00:10.118 --> 00:12.035
He admitted to buying
CIA intel,

00:12.153 --> 00:13.871
but he was working
for someone else--

00:13.955 --> 00:15.122
Nathan Mueller.

00:15.273 --> 00:17.207
He's CIA.

00:17.308 --> 00:20.160
We don't get too many visitors
way up here.

00:20.278 --> 00:21.295
Nathan, listen to me.

00:21.445 --> 00:22.796
There is a Reaper
on its way here

00:22.947 --> 00:24.298
to take out this entire camp.

00:24.448 --> 00:25.916
[Jet flying overhead]

00:28.002 --> 00:30.387
Target has been
neutralized.

00:30.522 --> 00:32.482
I know a guy off campus
who might be able to help.

00:32.506 --> 00:34.391
His name's Roger Bennett.
He's former CIA.

00:34.509 --> 00:36.810
- "Former"?
- He had a late-onset

00:36.961 --> 00:38.262
chemical imbalance,
but he's a good guy.

00:38.396 --> 00:39.429
And more importantly,
he's an expert

00:39.597 --> 00:40.757
in black market intelligence.

00:40.798 --> 00:42.266
We need to talk
about Nathan Mueller.

00:42.433 --> 00:43.934
There's a lot
you don't know, Auggie.

00:44.068 --> 00:45.769
- [Gasps]
- Myocarditis.

00:45.870 --> 00:47.988
It's a heart condition.
Annie has it.

00:48.139 --> 00:49.779
It's dangerous
for her to be in the field.

00:49.824 --> 00:51.441
You have evidence
to back this up?

00:51.576 --> 00:52.776
Yes. She lied.

00:52.860 --> 00:54.361
Something personal like this,

00:54.495 --> 00:56.079
is it really
that black and white?

00:56.197 --> 00:57.781
I am all yours
for the rest of the day.

00:57.949 --> 01:00.617
- I'm leaving, Auggie.
- Why? Because of Hayley?

01:00.752 --> 01:02.536
It's not that simple.

01:02.670 --> 01:04.837
I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

02:00.011 --> 02:01.311
You got to be kidding me.

02:01.396 --> 02:03.513
You've been dodging my calls,
Mr. Michaels.

02:03.648 --> 02:06.483
I was busy trying to catch
the terrorist behind Chicago.

02:06.601 --> 02:08.101
Being second-guessed
by the NCTC

02:08.235 --> 02:10.020
isn't high
on my priority list.

02:10.187 --> 02:12.522
Well, you're going to want
to hear what I have to say.

02:18.196 --> 02:20.497
Almost home.

02:20.615 --> 02:22.115
You didn't sleep at all.

02:22.250 --> 02:25.752
Must be the pilot in me.
I can never sleep on planes.

02:25.903 --> 02:29.089
What's your excuse?

02:29.240 --> 02:30.757
[Sighs]
I can't kick the feeling

02:30.908 --> 02:32.068
like there's work to be done.

02:32.093 --> 02:34.928
[Chuckles]
Sharks can't stop swimming.

02:35.079 --> 02:37.547
So I'm a shark?

02:39.267 --> 02:42.602
You're wired for a mission,
and so am I.

02:42.753 --> 02:45.105
There's nothing wrong
with that.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.905
Ryan, welcome back.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.074
And you must be
Annie Walker.

03:04.208 --> 03:05.792
Ryan's told me so much
about you.

03:05.943 --> 03:07.711
Caitlyn Cook.
Nice to meet you.

03:07.829 --> 03:10.047
- Can we give you a ride?
- Oh, no.

03:10.164 --> 03:11.548
I-I have my car here.

03:11.666 --> 03:14.051
- Well, my best to Joan, then.
- Will do.

03:14.168 --> 03:17.587
Um, bye, Ryan.

03:17.722 --> 03:19.473
Uh, bye.

03:23.094 --> 03:25.762
State needs to get
on the phone in 15 minutes

03:25.897 --> 03:27.931
to discuss
the Georgian delegation.

03:29.984 --> 03:32.269
Ryan?
Hmm?

03:32.403 --> 03:35.155
Yeah, 15 minutes--
that's no problem, yeah.

03:45.450 --> 03:47.117
Eight calls?

03:47.285 --> 03:50.003
This must be urgent.
Two urgent things, actually.

03:50.154 --> 03:52.089
The first four calls
were about you.

03:52.206 --> 03:53.673
Me?

03:53.824 --> 03:54.958
Remember
when I told you

03:55.093 --> 03:56.793
NCTC was drilling down
on everything?

03:56.928 --> 03:58.128
Yeah.

03:58.262 --> 04:00.297
Hayley Price found out
about your heart condition.

04:02.850 --> 04:05.469
- How'd she find out?
- Not from me.

04:05.603 --> 04:07.854
- Has she told anyone yet?
- I don't know.

04:08.005 --> 04:09.439
I worked hard to make sure
she trusts me,

04:09.524 --> 04:12.309
but I can't imagine she's going
to sit on this thing for long.

04:12.443 --> 04:14.227
Oh.

04:14.362 --> 04:15.529
I assume because we're here,

04:15.679 --> 04:17.279
the other four calls
were about Roger?

04:17.398 --> 04:19.116
Yeah, he has more intel.

04:19.233 --> 04:22.119
- Intel about what?
- Wouldn't say over the phone.

04:22.236 --> 04:26.072
You get on a plane
for 14 hours, a lot can happen.

04:30.244 --> 04:32.963
Whoa. It looks like someone
did some spring cleaning.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.832
Tracking the Postman
got me reinvigorated.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.051
I just kind of kept going.

04:38.202 --> 04:40.504
I've adjusted my meds.
I feel good.

04:40.671 --> 04:41.671
That's good.

04:44.008 --> 04:45.842
But you still droned
the wrong guy.

04:47.929 --> 04:49.396
Excuse me?

04:49.514 --> 04:52.415
That's
a big statement, Roger.

04:52.517 --> 04:55.068
I'm not saying
Mueller didn't deserve it.

04:55.219 --> 04:58.271
He did some very bad things,
but he didn't do Chicago.

04:58.389 --> 05:01.158
- Enlighten us.
- You followed the right path--

05:01.242 --> 05:04.528
from Borz to the Postman
to Ivan to Mueller.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.112
It's exactly
what I would have done.

05:06.247 --> 05:08.532
Except there's a missing link
in your chain--

05:08.666 --> 05:10.534
Ivan Kravec never met
Nathan Mueller.

05:10.701 --> 05:11.918
Ivan said he did.

05:12.069 --> 05:14.254
Speaking of stuff Ivan said,

05:14.405 --> 05:16.706
look at this.

05:20.127 --> 05:21.261
It's a CNI file.

05:21.412 --> 05:22.963
Spanish intelligence
rounded Ivan up

05:23.097 --> 05:24.798
six years ago in Barcelona

05:24.932 --> 05:27.133
in conjunction with
the Atocha Station bombings.

05:27.268 --> 05:29.886
He gave up some names
and then walked.

05:30.054 --> 05:32.389
By the time the CNI realized
he was lying,

05:32.557 --> 05:34.024
he had already moved to Paris,

05:34.141 --> 05:36.382
where there's no love lost
between intelligence services.

05:36.427 --> 05:38.387
So you think Ivan also lied
about knowing Mueller?

05:38.446 --> 05:39.863
I'm saying
there's a pattern.

05:39.947 --> 05:41.398
Okay, so he lied then.

05:41.532 --> 05:43.400
It doesn't necessarily mean
he lied about this.

05:43.568 --> 05:45.448
But you built your whole
intel chain on the guy.

05:45.536 --> 05:47.454
He's your key witness
and not a reliable one.

05:47.605 --> 05:50.407
If you think Mueller didn't
do it, who do you think did?

05:50.541 --> 05:52.492
I'm working on that.
I'm--I'm close.

05:52.627 --> 05:54.667
- We need more than close.
- Guys, I'm telling you--

05:54.778 --> 05:58.131
Langley got this wrong.
And I'm gonna get it right.

06:01.502 --> 06:03.386
What do you think
of Roger's theory?

06:03.504 --> 06:05.639
I think it's good,
but it needs work.

06:05.756 --> 06:07.841
Has he ever steered you wrong
on intel before?

06:07.958 --> 06:09.309
Nope.

06:09.460 --> 06:10.810
He found us the Postman.

06:10.961 --> 06:12.095
Let's keep looking into it,

06:12.263 --> 06:14.431
but not go wide until we have
something concrete.

06:14.565 --> 06:18.235
- Okay, I'll get into it.
- Yeah.

06:18.352 --> 06:19.769
Annie, welcome back.

06:19.854 --> 06:21.605
Nice work in Azerbaijan,
by the way.

06:21.772 --> 06:22.772
Team effort.

06:22.857 --> 06:24.137
So what do you think
you'll get--

06:24.191 --> 06:25.692
the service medal,
intelligence star?

06:25.826 --> 06:28.495
I don't deserve a medal.
Just doing my job.

06:28.646 --> 06:29.946
Yeah, yeah, but you know
you might even get

06:30.081 --> 06:31.531
the distinguished
intelligence cross, right?

06:31.649 --> 06:34.618
Thanks, Eric.
I should get back to work.

06:34.785 --> 06:37.287
Oh, yeah,
supreme work ethic--

06:37.455 --> 06:39.422

06:51.135 --> 06:52.886
- Okay.
- See? I told you, I knew it.

You wanted to see me?

07:11.572 --> 07:13.456
Have a seat.

07:22.333 --> 07:25.552

Joan's already
pulled the paperwork.

07:41.091 --> 07:42.675
Don't you want to hear
my side of the story?

07:42.793 --> 07:44.344
Unless it's you telling us you
don't have a heart condition

07:44.494 --> 07:46.963
and therefore you haven't been
lying to your Agency,

07:47.097 --> 07:48.765
it's not going to change
our position.

07:48.882 --> 07:51.884
My condition is manageable
with nitrate medication.

07:52.019 --> 07:55.305
So you've never had
an incident in the field?

07:55.439 --> 07:56.973
I've always gotten
the job done.

07:57.107 --> 07:58.308
That's not an answer.

07:58.475 --> 07:59.692
Annie, we don't want
to lose you as an officer.

07:59.843 --> 08:02.195
We're closing the case
on the Chicago attack

08:02.346 --> 08:04.614
because you identified
and helped remove

08:04.732 --> 08:07.650
Nathan Mueller in Azerbaijan.
Exactly.

08:07.818 --> 08:09.152
You know...

08:09.286 --> 08:12.822
There comes a time
in everyone's career...

08:14.291 --> 08:17.160
Where they get reassigned
a desk job.

08:17.328 --> 08:18.828
It happened to me.

08:18.962 --> 08:20.913
It happened to Joan
and Arthur.

08:21.048 --> 08:22.715
It happened to Auggie.
It happens.

08:22.866 --> 08:26.586
What I am good at
is working in the field.

08:26.703 --> 08:28.921
Well, this isn't just
about you.

08:29.056 --> 08:32.924
What happens if you collapse
in the field?

08:33.059 --> 08:35.311
You could be putting someone
else's life at risk as well.

08:35.395 --> 08:37.764
- So that's it?
- What else did you expect?

08:37.898 --> 08:40.350
I expected more...

08:40.433 --> 08:43.269
More of a fight,
more anger.

08:43.404 --> 08:45.655
Over and over

08:45.773 --> 08:48.358
I risk my life
for this Agency,

08:48.525 --> 08:50.443
for this job,
for this country,

08:50.577 --> 08:53.446
and you are standing there
like a bunch of H.R. reps!

08:53.580 --> 08:55.448
Oh, we're angry, Annie.

08:55.582 --> 08:58.251
We're very angry.

08:58.369 --> 09:00.203
We placed a lot of trust
in you.

09:00.337 --> 09:02.255
But we are putting that aside

09:02.406 --> 09:04.924
so we can find a way
to move forward together.

09:06.927 --> 09:10.129
I don't see
any together in this.

09:10.264 --> 09:13.299
[Door slams]

09:17.604 --> 09:19.522
Auggie.

09:21.892 --> 09:23.812
You mind telling me
which side the graffiti's on?

09:23.927 --> 09:26.562
I hate standing on
the wrong side of the Cold War.

09:29.066 --> 09:30.566
I just heard.
I'm sorry.

09:32.786 --> 09:34.320
They want you to be
a good soldier

09:34.455 --> 09:37.407
until you die or are no longer
of use to them,

09:37.541 --> 09:40.326
and then they put you
behind a desk.

09:40.461 --> 09:42.128
Come on in.
The water's fine.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.501
- Doesn't it bother you?
- It did.

09:48.635 --> 09:51.637
Sure.
And I miss it.

09:51.788 --> 09:54.974
But you can still do
valuable work.

09:55.092 --> 09:57.093
The only thing
I want to do right now,

09:57.261 --> 09:59.145
is follow down
Roger's intel.

09:59.296 --> 10:00.763
Well, then do that.

10:00.898 --> 10:02.148
Just be careful about it,

10:02.299 --> 10:04.767
because the expectation with
a desk is that you stay seated.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.821
So things are moving
pretty quickly.

10:08.939 --> 10:10.356
The White House
and the DNI are concerned

10:10.491 --> 10:12.158
about the Mueller situation.

10:12.309 --> 10:13.993
Concerned
about what exactly?

10:14.144 --> 10:16.245
Our decisions and protocols
leading to the strike.

10:16.363 --> 10:18.698
The DNI wants to meet
with both of you tomorrow.

10:18.815 --> 10:20.783
We think it best
if there's a lawyer present.

10:20.918 --> 10:22.285
I'm gonna come.

10:22.419 --> 10:25.254
Moments like this are why you
brought me over from Justice.

10:25.372 --> 10:27.256
- So this is a legal issue?
- Everything we did

10:27.374 --> 10:28.674
to get Mueller
was by the book.

10:28.825 --> 10:29.842
Was it?

10:29.960 --> 10:31.594
Damn straight it was.

10:31.678 --> 10:33.846
You're saying the White House
is concerned,

10:33.997 --> 10:36.015
but the target was vetted
through them.

10:36.166 --> 10:38.217
Yes, but the lead operative
on the ground, Annie Walker,

10:38.352 --> 10:39.769
has just been called
into question

10:39.853 --> 10:42.605
for lying to her Agency.

10:42.723 --> 10:46.108
- What are you suggesting?
- I'm not suggesting anything.

10:46.193 --> 10:47.810
I'm telling you
this looks bad.

10:47.945 --> 10:49.562
Walker was gone
for several months.

10:49.696 --> 10:51.364
She covered up
her heart condition.

10:51.515 --> 10:53.816
Why? Was she lying
about anything else?

10:53.951 --> 10:55.117
No, she wasn't.

10:55.235 --> 10:56.702
She lied because she wanted
to keep doing her job.

10:56.820 --> 10:59.822
Regardless, Annie Walker needs
to be at the inquest as well.

10:59.990 --> 11:02.458
You referred to it
as a meeting.

11:02.576 --> 11:05.127
Well, I expected you
to read between the lines.

11:05.245 --> 11:09.165
This is politics now,
not espionage.

11:09.333 --> 11:12.001
And if it seems appropriate,
you can create daylight

11:12.135 --> 11:13.669
between yourselves and Walker.

11:13.804 --> 11:17.173
You're saying throw Annie
under the bus.

11:17.307 --> 11:19.609
Only if you disagree
with the decisions she's made.

11:22.312 --> 11:26.349
So this is the desk,
the desk we have for you.

11:26.517 --> 11:27.850
I-it's a good desk.

11:28.018 --> 11:29.852
I mean, I know a lot
of people who have worked here,

11:30.020 --> 11:32.488
and they've had very positive
comments about, um...

11:32.606 --> 11:35.858
About, well--
the sightlines are...

11:36.026 --> 11:37.026
Good.

11:37.027 --> 11:39.412
- Thanks, Eric.
- Yeah.

11:41.398 --> 11:43.032
Annie...

11:43.166 --> 11:45.701
Calder and I are meeting
with the DNI tomorrow

11:45.836 --> 11:47.503
to discuss Mueller
and Chicago.

11:47.621 --> 11:49.088
We need you there.
Sure.

11:49.239 --> 11:50.706
We also need a timeline

11:50.874 --> 11:52.675
laying out your every move
since Chicago.

11:52.793 --> 11:54.343
Every move?

11:54.428 --> 11:55.928
DNI's gonna have a lot
of questions.

11:56.046 --> 11:58.631
I'm sure you can supply
some of the answers.

11:58.748 --> 11:59.882
Okay.

12:02.436 --> 12:06.222
Annie, listen,
about your work in the field...

12:06.390 --> 12:09.358
You weren't just good.

12:09.476 --> 12:12.478
You were exceptional.

12:12.596 --> 12:14.897
Thanks, Joan.

12:20.988 --> 12:23.039
[Keys clacking]

12:30.831 --> 12:34.634
[Telephone rings]

12:34.784 --> 12:36.252
Annie Walker.

12:36.336 --> 12:38.087
[Altered voice] Go to your car
in the parking lot.

12:38.221 --> 12:40.089
I'll call your cell
in five minutes.

12:40.257 --> 12:42.425
Who's this?
[Line clicks]

12:57.307 --> 12:58.357
Auggie.

12:58.492 --> 13:00.159
Joan, great.
You got a minute?

13:00.277 --> 13:01.494
Sure.

13:01.645 --> 13:03.112
I was going through
Ivan Kravec's

13:03.280 --> 13:05.581
interrogation transcript,
and I had a question.

13:05.666 --> 13:08.501
Did H.I.G. second-source
Ivan's connection to Mueller?

13:08.652 --> 13:10.002
There wasn't time.
We had to act.

13:10.153 --> 13:11.474
All right,
well, then do you think

13:11.488 --> 13:13.248
that giving up Mueller's name
might have been

13:13.256 --> 13:14.696
a survival mechanism?
It checked out.

13:14.708 --> 13:16.842
We found Ivan's courier
on his way to Mueller's camp.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.962
Yeah.
Listen, can we reopen Kravec?

13:20.130 --> 13:22.798
No. Kravec is no longer
in our custody.

13:22.933 --> 13:24.684
- What?
- Oligarchs tend to get unhappy

13:24.834 --> 13:26.018
when you grab
their money guy,

13:26.169 --> 13:27.687
so we swapped Kravec
for two of ours,

13:27.837 --> 13:29.355
which was a pretty good deal,
if you ask me.

13:29.506 --> 13:30.523
So we do make some deals.

13:30.641 --> 13:32.024
And now we're talking
about Annie.

13:32.142 --> 13:33.526
There had to have been
another way

13:33.677 --> 13:35.061
to keep her
in the field, Joan.

13:35.195 --> 13:36.915
Auggie, I wish there was.
My hands are tied.

13:37.013 --> 13:39.148
It's agency policy.
She can continue to succeed

13:39.316 --> 13:40.650
in the field
with her condition.

13:40.817 --> 13:42.034
We need her out there.

13:42.185 --> 13:44.286
Which is a decision
you made unilaterally.

13:44.404 --> 13:47.707
Annie could not have kept her
secret hidden without your help.

13:47.857 --> 13:49.937
So you should have told me
about that--you know that.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.627
I stand by my decisions

13:51.745 --> 13:54.330
and you should stand
behind Annie.

13:58.635 --> 14:01.003
[Sighs]

14:04.057 --> 14:07.093
[Cell phone ringing]

14:09.012 --> 14:10.229
- Hello?
- Are you alone?

14:10.347 --> 14:12.181
Yes, Roger, I'm alone.

14:12.349 --> 14:14.684
Mueller definitely
wasn't responsible for Chicago.

14:14.818 --> 14:16.268
I've got a guy deep
in the Russian embassy

14:16.403 --> 14:18.487
who says he has proof someone
else was behind the attack.

14:18.605 --> 14:21.524
- Definitive proof?
- Internal FSB files

14:21.658 --> 14:23.075
on Borz Altan.

14:23.226 --> 14:24.694
The Russians were
monitoring him too.

14:24.828 --> 14:26.696
They have intel linking him
to a single perpetrator.

14:26.863 --> 14:29.198
- You have a name?
- My contact wants payment.

14:29.332 --> 14:32.084
He says he'll only tell me
for $100,000.

14:32.235 --> 14:33.869
Needs it by tomorrow.

14:34.037 --> 14:36.038
That's why you called me
instead of Auggie.

14:36.206 --> 14:37.886
He's a tech op.
He can't get that much cash

14:37.907 --> 14:39.458
without a lot of time
and paperwork.

14:39.593 --> 14:41.210
You operatives have
carte blanche

14:41.344 --> 14:44.213
with the Agency's accounts.

14:44.347 --> 14:47.133
All right, uh...

14:47.267 --> 14:49.301
Let me see what I can do.

14:51.605 --> 14:53.105
So how are you gonna
get the money?

14:53.223 --> 14:54.774
I don't know.

14:54.924 --> 14:57.109
I was hoping
you could put in for it.

14:57.227 --> 14:58.394
Roger's right.

14:58.528 --> 15:00.329
Tech ops get to play
with expensive equipment.

15:00.430 --> 15:01.897
They don't let us
play with cash.

15:02.032 --> 15:04.984
You didn't tell him
you'd been sidelined?

15:05.118 --> 15:08.287
It didn't come up.

15:09.956 --> 15:11.874
I could talk to another one
of my operatives,

15:11.992 --> 15:13.325
piggyback on another mission.
No.

15:13.460 --> 15:15.077
I don't want to add
misappropriation of Agency funds

15:15.212 --> 15:16.212
to our list of sins.

15:16.279 --> 15:19.165
Then how are you going to get
100 grand?

15:29.009 --> 15:30.926
Annie Walker
to see Ryan McQuaid.

15:35.965 --> 15:36.965
Thanks.

15:40.804 --> 15:42.405
So you finally decided
to come and work--

15:42.472 --> 15:43.689
There's a good chance Mueller

15:43.824 --> 15:46.992
wasn't behind
the Chicago attack.

15:47.143 --> 15:48.494
Of all the things
I thought you might say,

15:48.645 --> 15:50.006
I wasn't expecting you
to say that.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.199
I've got an asset who can get
definitive proof who did it,

15:53.316 --> 15:54.700
which is why I need you.

15:57.287 --> 16:00.172
Okay. Shoot.

16:00.323 --> 16:02.792
The asset needs $100,000
to get the information.

16:02.959 --> 16:06.295
Your Agency won't give it
to you?

16:08.548 --> 16:10.683
The Agency found out
about my heart...

16:10.834 --> 16:12.935
and transferred me
to a desk.

16:13.053 --> 16:14.093
Langley would go ballistic

16:14.170 --> 16:15.721
if they knew
I was following this down.

16:15.839 --> 16:17.223
Jesus, Walker.
I'm sorry.

16:17.340 --> 16:19.475
Yeah, me too.

16:21.611 --> 16:23.979
Then we'd better get
this intel.

16:24.147 --> 16:26.065
I'll get the cash
out of the safe.

16:28.368 --> 16:30.452
Thanks.

16:30.537 --> 16:33.622
I have spent far more
on much less.

16:33.740 --> 16:36.158
Maybe you keep that
to yourself.

16:36.293 --> 16:38.160
[Chuckles]

16:45.552 --> 16:48.254
- Got a sec?
- Sure. What's up?

16:48.371 --> 16:50.723
I noticed Annie Walker
just entered the building.

16:50.841 --> 16:52.258
She didn't have
an official appointment.

16:52.392 --> 16:54.032
I thought maybe she was coming
to see you.

16:54.094 --> 16:56.312
No, she's not here
to see me.

16:56.429 --> 16:59.348
Did you know Annie
when you worked at the Agency?

16:59.516 --> 17:01.836
That's funny. Ryan asked me
that when I joined the company.

17:01.935 --> 17:04.353
He did?
What'd you say?

17:04.487 --> 17:06.521
I told him Annie
was one of the finest operatives

17:06.656 --> 17:08.741
I'd ever seen.

17:14.915 --> 17:17.415
Here you go.

17:23.256 --> 17:25.424

17:25.575 --> 17:27.292

since someone's been willing

17:27.426 --> 17:28.761
to back me like this.

[Sighs]

17:36.219 --> 17:38.354
[Safe beeps]

17:41.591 --> 17:43.642
What did the Agency say?

17:43.760 --> 17:46.278
They said this better pay off.

17:46.429 --> 17:47.980
I bet they did.

17:48.097 --> 17:50.065
Call me when you have
something.

17:53.269 --> 17:56.372
Hey! What are you
doing here?

17:56.456 --> 17:58.958
You don't live in the building!
You talking to me?

17:59.108 --> 18:00.542
- You're following me!
- I do. I live in--

18:00.627 --> 18:02.661
- I've seen you before.
I know you're following me.

18:02.796 --> 18:04.196
I'm sorry.
My brother has troubles--

18:04.297 --> 18:05.998
- He's following me!
- Your brother just attacked me.

18:06.115 --> 18:07.216
Please leave.

18:07.334 --> 18:08.801
Do it again,
I'll call the cops.

18:08.952 --> 18:10.793
- Stop following me!
- Nobody is following you.

18:10.921 --> 18:13.088
It's okay.
Just calm down.

18:13.256 --> 18:14.924
[Kicks wall]

18:15.058 --> 18:17.426
[Sobs]
It's okay.

18:19.963 --> 18:22.314
I'm sorry, Annie.

18:22.465 --> 18:24.483
I'm sorry.

18:30.262 --> 18:33.514
- Doughnut's good.
- Good.

18:36.312 --> 18:38.980
- Look, I'm--I'm sorry.
- You don't have to explain.

18:39.131 --> 18:41.399
I thought I had it
under control.

18:41.517 --> 18:43.768
You know, the mission
was really helping me focus,

18:43.903 --> 18:45.687
getting to work with you
and Auggie,

18:45.821 --> 18:48.072
who I respect more
than anyone at the agency,

18:48.190 --> 18:50.408
and the meds were helping.

18:50.526 --> 18:52.777
But then...

18:52.862 --> 18:55.830
I could've sworn
that guy had been following me.

18:55.948 --> 18:57.498
You're working on it.

18:57.616 --> 18:59.784
That's what's important.

19:02.037 --> 19:04.789
Have you ever had
any kind of illness?

19:04.924 --> 19:07.792
Mental illness? No.

19:07.927 --> 19:11.596
Funny thing, the brain...

19:11.714 --> 19:13.965
It's your reality.

19:14.133 --> 19:15.884
Spy work messes with that.

19:16.018 --> 19:18.019
Reality becomes less real.

19:18.137 --> 19:20.939
You're in the wilderness
of mirrors.

19:21.056 --> 19:24.809
What are you going to do,
smash every mirror?

19:27.613 --> 19:31.316
Spy craft--
the thing that I'm best at,

19:31.483 --> 19:34.652
the very thing that gives me
a purpose--

19:34.787 --> 19:36.154
is also killing me.

19:38.190 --> 19:40.491
What kind of life is that?

19:43.162 --> 19:45.330
It's the life we choose.

19:48.550 --> 19:51.753
Look, I know you have
to take back the money.

19:51.887 --> 19:54.923
I know how the Agency regards
people with illnesses.

19:55.057 --> 19:56.841
But, please...

19:56.926 --> 19:59.677
give me one more chance.

19:59.812 --> 20:02.013
I'm not the Agency.

20:02.181 --> 20:03.598
I trust you.

20:07.603 --> 20:10.488
[Indistinct chatter]

20:16.779 --> 20:18.663
Thanks.

20:22.835 --> 20:24.702
Auggie.

20:26.956 --> 20:29.841
We agreed you would talk to me
before you moved on Annie,

20:29.925 --> 20:32.043
but your agenda
was more important

20:32.211 --> 20:33.461
than her career, I guess,

20:33.595 --> 20:35.430
because the minute she got
to the bottom of Chicago,

20:35.547 --> 20:37.098
you didn't have
any more use for her.

20:37.249 --> 20:38.466
Is that about right?

20:38.583 --> 20:40.301
If that's how you want
to look at it.

20:40.419 --> 20:42.470
Change my perspective.

20:42.604 --> 20:44.722
I was doing my job.

20:44.857 --> 20:47.942
You knew she had a condition,
and you were hiding it.

20:48.093 --> 20:49.444
I was looking out
for her best interest.

20:49.594 --> 20:51.145
Okay, so how are you gonna
feel if you get a call

20:51.280 --> 20:52.760
that Annie had an episode
on a mission

20:52.865 --> 20:54.706
and her heart got the best
of her and she died?

20:54.766 --> 20:56.317
She knew the risks.

20:56.452 --> 20:59.287
That was her decision to make,
not mine and not yours.

20:59.438 --> 21:01.438
Okay, did you call me here
to read me the riot act?

21:01.440 --> 21:04.158
Because you could have done this
in an e-mail.

21:04.293 --> 21:06.744
No.

21:06.912 --> 21:09.163
Oh.

21:09.298 --> 21:10.331
[Chuckles]

21:10.466 --> 21:12.800
You asked me here
to break up with me.

21:12.951 --> 21:14.635
Look, I wanted to do it
in person.

21:14.753 --> 21:17.221
Well, if this is your version
of chivalry,

21:17.306 --> 21:19.974
don't do me any favors.

[Keys clacking]

21:29.101 --> 21:31.436
Annie, I haven't received
your timeline.

21:31.570 --> 21:33.604
I know. I'm still not
finished yet.

21:33.739 --> 21:35.606
That was the only task
on your desk,

21:35.774 --> 21:36.824
and it was crucial.

21:36.975 --> 21:39.327
What have you been doing?

21:39.478 --> 21:41.913
Annie, if you walk
in there unprepared,

21:41.997 --> 21:44.515
it could be seen
as an evasive move.

21:44.650 --> 21:46.784
- Seen by who?
- By the DNI,

21:46.919 --> 21:48.753
by the lawyers,
by the White House,

21:48.871 --> 21:50.621
by anybody who wants
an answer.

21:50.706 --> 21:53.291
It seems like I'm being called
to the mat on this.

21:53.459 --> 21:55.460
I'm trying
to protect you here.

21:55.627 --> 21:57.295
We're all being scrutinized
for Mueller,

21:57.463 --> 22:00.631
and I'm just trying
to make this work.

22:00.799 --> 22:01.966
You can give verbal answers

22:02.101 --> 22:03.601
where you don't have
the proper documentation.

22:03.719 --> 22:05.136
Hopefully that works.

22:12.644 --> 22:16.447
You signed out $100,000
from the vault?

22:16.532 --> 22:17.532
That's right.

22:17.616 --> 22:18.816
For what?

22:18.951 --> 22:21.235
I understand.

22:21.370 --> 22:22.737
It's your company.
It's your money.

22:22.871 --> 22:23.988
Yes, it is.

22:24.123 --> 22:25.656
Well, you don't have
to explain.

22:25.741 --> 22:27.325
But you hired me
to look after the bottom line,

22:27.459 --> 22:28.699
and that's
all I'm trying to do.

22:28.794 --> 22:30.378
With the number of new
contracts we've gotten recently,

22:30.496 --> 22:31.746
we can afford the money.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.581
So budget the 100k
to asset maintenance,

22:33.715 --> 22:35.099
if that helps.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.280
So now Annie Walker is
an asset for McQuaid Security?

22:39.221 --> 22:40.638
I noticed the money
was signed out

22:40.756 --> 22:42.473
when she was in the office
yesterday.

22:42.591 --> 22:44.058
Anything you want
to loop me in on?

22:44.209 --> 22:47.261
Caitlyn, I have everything
under control.

22:47.396 --> 22:49.480
I just hope
you're running Annie

22:49.598 --> 22:51.516
and it's not
the other way around.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.767
Joan.
Good to see you, Bill.

23:26.885 --> 23:28.803
- Mr. Michaels.
- Deputy Director.

23:28.937 --> 23:31.272
I'd like to introduce you
operative Annie Walker.

23:31.423 --> 23:33.024
She was on the ground
in Azerbaijan

23:33.108 --> 23:34.942
during the drone strike.
Hello, Miss Walker.

23:35.060 --> 23:36.144
Good to meet you, sir.

23:36.278 --> 23:37.445
Hope you've cleared
your schedule.

23:37.596 --> 23:38.779
We're gonna have you here
for a while.

23:38.930 --> 23:39.930
Of course.

23:39.931 --> 23:41.365
The Director will see
you two first.

23:41.483 --> 23:43.367
There are a few items that are
above Miss Walker's clearance.

23:43.452 --> 23:47.071
Miss Walker, we'll retrieve you
in a few minutes.

23:47.239 --> 23:49.323
See you in a bit.

23:54.613 --> 23:57.465
[Cell phone vibrating]

24:00.469 --> 24:02.253
- Hello?
- Annie, it's Roger.

24:02.421 --> 24:04.055
[Whispering]
Roger.

24:04.139 --> 24:05.806
I can't talk right now.

24:05.924 --> 24:06.974
Hold on.

24:07.092 --> 24:08.676
Did your contact
give you the intel?

24:08.793 --> 24:10.428
Do the files say
who was behind Chicago?

24:10.512 --> 24:12.263
Yes, but they know I'm looking
into them--I don't know how.

24:12.431 --> 24:13.564
But I need to get out of town
immediately.

24:13.682 --> 24:16.017
Are you sure about this?

24:16.134 --> 24:18.653
This is not like with
the dog walker. This is real.

24:18.803 --> 24:22.156
This intel is real.
You'll see when I show you.

24:33.001 --> 24:34.669
Meet me at the train station
in Brunswick at 5:10.

24:34.819 --> 24:36.537
No, there's not enough time.

24:36.672 --> 24:38.672
The Agency has resources
for urgent asset meetings.

24:38.707 --> 24:41.542
This is urgent.

24:41.677 --> 24:43.211
[Sighs]

24:43.328 --> 24:44.962

24:45.097 --> 24:47.515
Hayley Price.
Ii remember.

24:47.666 --> 24:49.383
Listen, I was just
doing my job.

24:49.518 --> 24:51.135
I...

24:51.270 --> 24:52.470
I have to go.

24:58.009 --> 24:59.443
[Sighs]

24:59.528 --> 25:03.197
Miss Price, Annie Walker
was here a moment ago.

25:03.348 --> 25:04.565
Did you see
where she went?

25:04.683 --> 25:07.702
Yes, Deputy Director.
She just left.

[Cell phone ringing]

25:33.211 --> 25:36.230
- Thanks for the lift.
- Of course.

25:53.593 --> 25:56.011
You think we can make it
to Brunswick by 5:10?

25:56.129 --> 25:57.880
It's about 40 miles away.
I think we'll make it.

25:57.964 --> 25:59.381
The train's only there
for three minutes.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.799
Who are we chasing, anyway?

26:00.934 --> 26:02.295
- Remember your $100,000?
- Mm-hmm.

26:02.385 --> 26:05.020
Roger Bennett.
He's an ex-CIA tech op.

26:05.138 --> 26:07.723
Why is Roger Bennett
making life so difficult?

26:07.857 --> 26:09.642
- He thinks he's being followed.
- Well, he's a spy.

26:09.776 --> 26:11.443
There's a pretty good chance
he's right.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.464
[Telephone rings]
Yeah?

26:15.598 --> 26:18.734
Do you have anything to do
with Annie leaving ODNI?

26:18.868 --> 26:20.319
Leaving? I thought she was
with you and Calder.

26:20.453 --> 26:23.656
She left us standing
in director Fitzgerald's office,

26:23.790 --> 26:26.325
and then out of the blue,
Caitlyn Cook calls me

26:26.442 --> 26:29.745
and asks me about an Op Annie's
working with Ryan McQuaid.

26:29.913 --> 26:32.331
We should talk.

26:37.787 --> 26:40.472
[Cell phone ringing]

26:40.590 --> 26:43.258
Auggie, I'm on my way
to meet Roger in Brunswick.

26:43.393 --> 26:44.560
He's got the intel,

26:44.678 --> 26:46.011
but he wouldn't give it to me
over the phone.

26:46.129 --> 26:47.429
- Why is he on the move?
- He's scared.

26:47.564 --> 26:48.681
He thinks he's been burned.

26:48.815 --> 26:50.599
He's enacting
exit protocols.

26:50.767 --> 26:52.685
Annie, you left
Joan and Calder at ODNI.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.520
- I had no choice.
- Well, if Roger's intel

26:54.637 --> 26:56.689
doesn't pan out,
they're gonna suspend you.

26:56.806 --> 26:59.274
Yeah, I know.

26:59.409 --> 27:00.409
Good luck.

27:03.446 --> 27:04.830
You get all that?

27:04.981 --> 27:08.450
What, they're gonna suspend
you for trying to get the truth?

27:10.787 --> 27:12.788
There, that's the train
right there.

27:29.472 --> 27:31.306
Excuse me.

27:38.347 --> 27:39.347
There.

27:54.664 --> 27:55.664
Roger.

27:55.698 --> 27:58.417

27:58.551 --> 28:00.419

- What happened?

28:39.759 --> 28:41.677

- Come on, stand back.

28:41.761 --> 28:43.428
Roger!

28:47.584 --> 28:49.935
He's gone.

28:50.086 --> 28:52.221

at the Agency.

29:20.884 --> 29:24.503
I wish he hadn't died
for nothing.

29:24.637 --> 29:27.990
I dragged you into this.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.594
We may not be operative
and handler anymore,

29:32.679 --> 29:34.930
but we're still a team.

Nothing's gonna change that,
no matter what happens in there.

29:39.635 --> 29:40.986
I know.

29:41.137 --> 29:43.322
[Telephone rings]

29:43.472 --> 29:45.324
Yes?

Please go in, Miss Walker.

Where's Calder?

30:03.259 --> 30:05.210
He's still
at Liberty Crossing.

30:05.345 --> 30:08.630
After you disappeared,
the DNI was so pissed off

30:08.765 --> 30:10.632
at our disorganization

30:10.800 --> 30:13.535
and Calder's seeming
lack of control over his people

30:13.670 --> 30:16.855
that he asked Calder to defend
every decision he's made

30:17.006 --> 30:19.641
since being named
interim DCS.

30:19.809 --> 30:23.111
The director made sure
to underscore "interim."

30:23.229 --> 30:25.530
He could lose his job, Annie.

30:25.681 --> 30:28.150
I had to go.

30:28.284 --> 30:31.203
I had find out who Ivan Kravec
was really working for.

30:31.354 --> 30:33.322
- Besides Nathan Mueller?
- Yes.

30:33.489 --> 30:35.240
But I knew I needed
unassailable proof

30:35.358 --> 30:37.626
to bring it in.
And do you have proof?

30:37.744 --> 30:42.381
Roger Bennett said he had
an FSB file

30:42.531 --> 30:44.917
from a source deep
in the Russian embassy.

30:45.051 --> 30:48.337
Roger Bennett was found
with conspiracy theories,

30:48.421 --> 30:51.139
nothing relating
to Mueller or Chicago.

30:51.257 --> 30:52.424
Just because someone
has an illness

30:52.558 --> 30:53.976
doesn't mean
they're not valuable.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.560
He gave his life
for the Agency.

30:55.711 --> 30:58.563
Are we talking about Roger
or you now?

30:58.714 --> 31:00.565
I needed to find the truth.

31:05.438 --> 31:08.190
Why didn't you
let me in, Annie?

31:08.324 --> 31:11.693
It's because
you didn't trust me enough

31:11.778 --> 31:14.196
to know
that I would help you.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.948
But I would have helped you.

31:18.251 --> 31:20.369
And now we're here.

Here's your stuff.

32:00.803 --> 32:01.920
It's not a very big bag,

32:02.054 --> 32:05.590
because we weren't together
for very long.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.425
No, I guess not.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.010
You know
what really bugs me?

32:09.145 --> 32:12.063
Is that in your version of
this story, you're the good guy.

32:12.214 --> 32:14.432
All I wanted to do
was find out the truth.

32:14.567 --> 32:16.851
Yeah, well, you found it.

32:17.019 --> 32:19.854
It's what you did with it
that bothers me.

32:20.022 --> 32:21.689
I wasn't the one
keeping secrets

32:21.774 --> 32:23.014
or going behind people's backs.

32:23.025 --> 32:24.192
What is that
supposed to mean?

32:24.360 --> 32:26.277
It means that the truth
matters to me,

32:26.412 --> 32:28.530
which seems to be
a pretty rare quality to find

32:28.664 --> 32:30.698
in this line of work
these days.

32:30.866 --> 32:33.418
You turned on Annie
because you were angry with me.

32:33.569 --> 32:36.454
Do you really think
I'm that unprofessional?

32:36.589 --> 32:39.591
Please. Auggie, I saw you
on the street with that girl.

32:39.741 --> 32:41.509
That doesn't matter.

32:41.627 --> 32:44.128
The point is, you used me.

32:44.263 --> 32:45.880
I was just another Op.

32:46.015 --> 32:47.632
It's more complicated
than that.

32:47.766 --> 32:48.800
And then you broke it off

32:48.917 --> 32:51.719
because
I wasn't necessary anymore.

32:51.887 --> 32:54.522
You know, my only mistake
in this entire thing

32:54.640 --> 32:56.691
is that I trusted you.

32:56.775 --> 32:59.978
And you hold yourself up
like this military man,

33:00.112 --> 33:03.565
like you're morally superior
to all the other Langley spies.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.200
Well, you're not.

all the rest of them.

glass-half-full kind of guy,

that goes so long

in the middle is bad.

been shorter if you played it

33:27.172 --> 33:28.473
a little differently.

33:28.624 --> 33:29.757
Differently how?

By not defending
Joan so much.

33:31.560 --> 33:33.228

but Joan--

33:33.312 --> 33:34.729

were protecting her in there,

when you didn't need to.

33:36.232 --> 33:38.566

for doing everything I do.

33:38.684 --> 33:39.934
All right. Whatever.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.237
I'll call you when
they have follow-up questions,

33:42.321 --> 33:44.989
which they surely will.

you're thinking about.

33:59.121 --> 34:00.755
You're thinking about Annie.

34:00.873 --> 34:02.957
The truth is,
you were a fantastic mentor.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.959

a seasoned operative now.

She--she makes
her own decisions.

It's not Annie's decisions
I'm thinking about.

34:11.216 --> 34:13.351
No?

34:16.004 --> 34:19.857
I've just witnessed
how quickly we, the Agency,

can turn against our own

when we don't agree
with someone's choices.

about the Balkans.

about your secret getting out.

That's not gonna happen.

36:08.133 --> 36:09.751
There's not gonna be
a next one,

36:09.918 --> 36:11.386
not for me, anyway.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.004
They suspended you?

36:17.676 --> 36:19.260
You're staying for a drink.

36:19.428 --> 36:22.346
- No, it's okay. I don't--
- It wasn't a question.

36:32.241 --> 36:35.076
Thanks.

36:35.244 --> 36:37.162
So what now?

36:37.279 --> 36:38.997
I don't know.

36:41.634 --> 36:43.501
I me--it looks like
we're not gonna be seeing

36:43.636 --> 36:45.170
each other anymore.

36:47.139 --> 36:50.258
So this is good-bye?

36:50.393 --> 36:52.594
Yeah.

36:54.963 --> 36:59.100
Well, it's been nice
knowing you, Annie Walker.

38:34.280 --> 38:37.916
It's been a long time since
I stayed up all night talking.

38:38.066 --> 38:40.752
Well, I am an exceptionally
good conversationalist.

38:40.903 --> 38:43.588
[Both laugh]

38:43.706 --> 38:45.039
Coffee?

38:45.174 --> 38:47.375
Yeah. Thanks.

38:50.596 --> 38:53.047
It's not like I have to be
at the office.

38:53.182 --> 38:55.049
[Laughs]

38:56.969 --> 39:00.271
It feels strange not having
anywhere to go.

39:00.389 --> 39:02.807
Or another way
of looking at it

39:02.942 --> 39:07.195
is that you can go
anywhere you want to be.

39:10.766 --> 39:13.201
Thanks.

39:24.713 --> 39:27.215
[Doorbell rings]

39:29.418 --> 39:31.336
[Laughs]

39:31.470 --> 39:33.721
Were you expecting
somebody?

39:36.509 --> 39:39.093
I am gonna get rid
of whoever that is immediately.

39:41.147 --> 39:43.181
Okay.

39:49.071 --> 39:51.523
[Cell phone vibrating]

39:56.645 --> 39:59.113
Auggie,
it's, uh, a little early.

39:59.248 --> 40:01.115
Yeah, I'll make it quick.
Listen, I was up all night

40:01.283 --> 40:02.617
thinking about what happened
to Roger.

40:02.701 --> 40:04.341
I dug through the papers
you found on him,

40:04.420 --> 40:05.920
looking for anything
he might have left us--

40:06.038 --> 40:07.372
a message, a clue.

40:07.489 --> 40:09.707
- Did you find anything?
- No. And that's the point.

40:09.842 --> 40:12.010
Roger,
even at his most paranoid,

40:12.160 --> 40:15.380
was too smart to buy into any
of that conspiracy-theory crap.

40:15.497 --> 40:16.965
Do you think somebody
was trying to frame him?

40:17.099 --> 40:19.467
What exactly did you see
at the train station?

40:19.635 --> 40:21.970
Did you see Roger
run into traffic?

40:23.973 --> 40:25.690
Auggie, he's here.

40:25.841 --> 40:27.141
Who?

40:27.309 --> 40:29.861
Annie, who is it?

40:29.979 --> 40:32.647
The dog walker that Roger said
was following him--

40:32.815 --> 40:34.315
he's here at McQuaid's house.

40:34.483 --> 40:37.202
You're at McQuaid's?

40:37.319 --> 40:39.821
Yeah.

40:39.955 --> 40:41.906
You think Roger was right?

40:42.024 --> 40:43.491
Come over here
as soon as you leave.

40:43.659 --> 40:45.493
Okay. I got to go.

40:46.996 --> 40:49.330
[Clears throat]

40:49.465 --> 40:51.065
[Zipper closes]

40:55.537 --> 40:58.006
What'd I miss?

40:58.030 --> 41:04.030
