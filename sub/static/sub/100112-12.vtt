WEBVTT

00:03.553 --> 00:05.885
Grandpa, when can we
close the door? I'm freezing.

00:06.114 --> 00:10.048
I can't feel my nose, I don't
know if it's a finger or nose thing.

00:11.364 --> 00:14.467
First I got to fix the leak so the
outlet doesn't short out again.

00:14.468 --> 00:17.860
Once the smoke smell is gone we can
put the TV back and close the door.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.220
At least it was warm for a second
when the flames shot out of the wall.

00:22.548 --> 00:26.834
You know what, we're all
uncomfortable right now. Suck it up.

00:26.884 --> 00:31.363
Hey, just because you're in a bad mood.
Don't take it out on Mark.

00:31.364 --> 00:34.071
He's a sweet, innocent kid who

00:34.072 --> 00:38.625
does all of our laundry. Your stuff
is sitting in the dryer, by the way.

00:40.118 --> 00:44.397
I'm sorry, kid. It's not you.
I got some stuff going on.

00:44.398 --> 00:46.404
That's okay.
Is it going to keep you and

00:46.405 --> 00:48.677
Louise from coming to my
acappella concert?

00:48.701 --> 00:51.094
I can't hang on to these
house seats forever.

00:52.130 --> 00:57.059
Louise isn't going to make it.
She's not real happy with me, right now.

00:57.060 --> 01:02.129
I'll keep both seats in case I
nod off and tip over.

01:04.321 --> 01:07.839
I found something we can have
for dinner while we keep our

01:07.840 --> 01:09.838
hands warm on the trash
can fire I'm going

01:09.839 --> 01:11.445
to start, right here in the kitchen.

01:12.508 --> 01:14.330
Three boxes of Mac and
cheese, and they're

01:14.331 --> 01:17.030
all open with the
cheese packets are missing.

01:17.031 --> 01:20.198
We've been the victims
of a very odd burglary.

01:20.735 --> 01:22.493
Alright, that's on me.
The nacho chips

01:22.517 --> 01:24.294
I bought at the auto
parts store didn't

01:24.295 --> 01:27.352
have enough cheese on them.
So I recheesed them from the packets.

01:27.353 --> 01:29.774
Well, we can probably put something

01:29.775 --> 01:35.784
else on them.
We have Chinese mustard and red

01:35.785 --> 01:38.914
chili flakes packets.
Just throw that on the macaroni

01:38.915 --> 01:41.161
and see who taps out first.

01:42.438 --> 01:43.853
Another way to solve this

01:43.854 --> 01:47.053
problem is by somebody going
shopping.

01:47.054 --> 01:50.763
I have three hours of the new
Hampshire primary I have to

01:50.764 --> 01:53.202
watch for school tomorrow, and
I'd like some snacks.

01:53.203 --> 01:56.321
That's great.
I think it's important for kids

01:56.322 --> 01:59.581
- to learn how politics work.
- Yeah, the early primaries are exciting.

01:59.582 --> 02:00.833
That's where you get to see

02:00.857 --> 02:02.251
the candidates with
integrity and vision

02:02.252 --> 02:04.797
right before the
rich ones swoop in and crush

02:04.798 --> 02:09.541
them with their corporate
campaign dollars.

02:11.507 --> 02:12.563
Wow, mom.

02:12.564 --> 02:16.696
That's pretty cynical. I think
people with integrity and vision can

02:16.780 --> 02:18.222
make it all the way to president.

02:18.223 --> 02:19.668
Like George Washington.

02:19.669 --> 02:22.321
He was rich. He didn't want it.
They forced him.

02:22.963 --> 02:26.029
- Okay, then Lincoln.
- Shot.

02:27.966 --> 02:30.451
- Hamilton.
- Yeah, he was good.

02:30.452 --> 02:33.224
But he wasn't president.
He's just a character in a

02:33.225 --> 02:36.416
really cool musical we'll never
be rich enough to afford to see.

02:37.861 --> 02:41.770
- Oh, and shot.
- You can't stop me from being

02:41.771 --> 02:44.939
optimistic about this country.
Everybody has a right to be

02:44.940 --> 02:46.739
heard.
Did you know anyone can pick up

02:46.740 --> 02:48.897
the phone and call the White House.

02:48.898 --> 02:51.111
No way. If you can't call The Rock, you

02:51.112 --> 02:54.997
- can't call the White House.
- Watch.

02:57.142 --> 02:58.992
Thank you for calling the
White House...

02:58.993 --> 03:02.041
Are you crazy?
They're going to trace this back

03:02.042 --> 03:05.607
to us and put us on the no-fly list.

03:05.903 --> 03:09.579
When was the last
time any of us flew?

03:09.603 --> 03:12.886
If they ever put us on the no-bus
list, then we'll have a problem.

03:15.103 --> 03:18.853
Why are you scared of the government?
They work for us.

03:18.854 --> 03:21.583
You can even tweet the president
and tell him what you want.

03:21.584 --> 03:27.102
I'm not scared.
Hi, @realdonaldtrump, since you work

03:27.103 --> 03:31.047
for us, can you send us some
cheese packets for our macaroni.

03:31.922 --> 03:36.495
This is @realmaryconner, from
Lanford, Illinois. Where Chicago is.

03:36.496 --> 03:41.641
He'll probably answer back.
That guy loves to tweet.

03:41.642 --> 03:45.032
That's how we learn
where our military is.

03:45.965 --> 03:50.779
Hey, look who's here.
It's good to live on your own,

03:50.780 --> 03:52.436
but you miss your mommy, don't you?

03:52.437 --> 03:54.926
No, gross. My laptop died.

03:54.927 --> 03:57.385
I came to see if it was still
under warranty.

03:57.386 --> 04:00.094
Of course it did, she'll just send it
back to where she bought it,

04:00.095 --> 04:03.974
She'll mail it to guy on
off-ramp with old army jacket.

04:05.296 --> 04:08.461
Yeah, well we're going to have to
figure out how to get me a new one.

04:08.462 --> 04:10.837
Are you insane, woman,
we don't even have food.

04:10.838 --> 04:13.994
- Oh, fine I'll just take Mark's.
- Ah, no.

04:13.995 --> 04:17.625
It's mine and I'm going to need it
to write my report on the primary.

04:18.177 --> 04:20.668
That's why I should have his
computer, he's wasting it.

04:23.014 --> 04:24.617
Just because you think he's a

04:24.618 --> 04:27.205
dork doesn't mean that he
shouldn't have your laptop.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.168
And you really should be
taking this election seriously.

04:30.192 --> 04:32.461
You're finally old enough to vote.

04:32.462 --> 04:34.437
And whoever wins the New Hampshire is

04:34.461 --> 04:36.301
the early leader for the nomination.

04:36.302 --> 04:40.282
Oh no. What happens if the person I
don't care about gets the nomination

04:40.283 --> 04:42.516
over the other person
that I don't care about?

04:42.800 --> 04:45.006
All politicians are the same.

04:45.293 --> 04:46.656
No there not.

04:46.671 --> 04:49.114
Yes, some of them are
terrible, but if you

04:49.138 --> 04:51.553
do some research,
you'll find some of them

04:51.554 --> 04:53.737
really, really terrible.

04:56.483 --> 04:59.066
If you vote,
you'll be proud that you help

04:59.067 --> 05:01.787
elect somebody who is just terrible.

05:04.389 --> 05:06.997
She's probably just hungry.
She'll feel better about the

05:06.998 --> 05:11.292
government once she eats a
drawer full of condiments.

05:17.856 --> 05:20.905
You are watching "The
Conners" live right now, in

05:20.906 --> 05:22.995
front of a studio audience.

05:22.996 --> 05:24.449
Hey, Louise.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.209
Hey, Darlene. What's up?

05:26.210 --> 05:28.864
We were on our way to the grocery
store, but that seemed like a

05:28.865 --> 05:30.556
lot of work. So we came here.

05:31.651 --> 05:34.320
Becky, I was going to call you.

05:34.321 --> 05:37.119
I'm leaving on tour with
my band on Wednesday.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.668
I was wondering if you could
cover my shift for a week until

05:40.669 --> 05:43.798
- my replacement starts.
- Sure, how long will you be gone?

05:43.799 --> 05:46.538
- At least three months.
- Wow.

05:46.539 --> 05:49.108
Dad didn't mention you
were going on tour.

05:49.109 --> 05:52.230
- He didn't?
- Nope.

05:52.548 --> 05:54.339
Yeah.
I bet he was upset when he found

05:54.340 --> 05:56.268
out you were leaving.
Did he tell you he didn't want

05:56.269 --> 05:58.218
- you to go?
- No, he said it was a great

05:58.219 --> 06:00.570
opportunity and I should take it.

06:01.202 --> 06:03.220
So I'm taking it.

06:03.244 --> 06:06.951
Dad is an idiot, for letting her go.

06:06.952 --> 06:11.362
A woman with that waistline in
this town, and no meth problem?

06:13.131 --> 06:15.085
You're not going to find that.

06:15.109 --> 06:17.348
Yeah, I bet he already regrets it.

06:17.349 --> 06:19.372
That's why he's been
in such a bad mood.

06:19.373 --> 06:21.954
He's worried she's going to
meet somebody on the road.

06:21.955 --> 06:24.387
Why would Louise cheat on dad?
They're dating.

06:24.388 --> 06:27.818
Are they though?
The only time I saw him touch her,

06:27.819 --> 06:31.267
they were sitting on the couch
and he nodded off and fell over.

06:33.424 --> 06:34.438
I can't believe dad is going

06:34.439 --> 06:36.846
to blow it with Louise and there
is nothing we can do about it.

06:36.847 --> 06:38.188
Oh, hell, yeah there is.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.425
Dad hasn't dated in over 45 years.

06:40.426 --> 06:43.017
It's like chipping a
neanderthal out of the ice.

06:43.018 --> 06:46.098
You can't just shave him
and throw him on tinder.

06:46.536 --> 06:47.836
We got to step in.

06:48.065 --> 06:49.565
So, what are you saying?

06:49.566 --> 06:52.726
You're going to get Dad to tell
Louise he loves her in two days.

06:52.727 --> 06:54.753
He's never even said that to me.

06:54.777 --> 06:57.350
Take a hint and move on.

06:59.739 --> 07:04.381
Look, we all know that dad
opens up when he drinks, right?

07:04.382 --> 07:07.741
So, we just throw a fake little
going away party, for Louise.

07:07.765 --> 07:08.931
We get a few shots in him,

07:08.932 --> 07:10.817
and maybe he opens up and tells her

07:10.841 --> 07:12.892
how he feels and cements
the relationship.

07:13.477 --> 07:16.236
- That's a great idea.
- No, it's not.

07:16.237 --> 07:19.804
- No, it's not.
- Look, it's all I got.

07:19.805 --> 07:22.444
Do you want to be helping
dad off the pot when he's 80?

07:22.445 --> 07:25.127
I'm back to liking it.

07:25.827 --> 07:28.481
Louise, couldn't help

07:28.482 --> 07:33.344
overhearing, even though my Nanna
calls eaves dropping the devils radio.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.596
I work with Dan every day.

07:36.597 --> 07:39.122
And no matter what he says, he's
going to be missing his lady

07:39.123 --> 07:41.951
- like crazy.
- I'm not his lady.

07:41.952 --> 07:46.052
And just between us, Dan
couldn't commit to a real

07:46.053 --> 07:49.093
relationship. So I broke up with him.

07:49.155 --> 07:54.934
Louise, I'm shook.
But I understand what a tough

07:54.935 --> 07:59.444
nut to crack Dan is.
This one time, he and I had a few

07:59.445 --> 08:02.044
beers, throwing firecrackers at
one another.

08:02.045 --> 08:04.878
I made the mistake of opening up.

08:04.879 --> 08:08.036
But it's okay.
I didn't say I love you for him.

08:08.037 --> 08:11.206
I said it for me.

08:13.045 --> 08:14.536
Thanks, Dwight.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.546
I'm just glad I'm going on this tour.

08:16.547 --> 08:19.964
I really don't want
to see him right now.

08:19.965 --> 08:21.990
So, we get them in the
same room together and just let

08:21.991 --> 08:23.229
the magic happen?

08:24.403 --> 08:25.649
I think dad will really thank

08:25.650 --> 08:28.660
- us for getting involved.
- Maybe your dad will.

08:28.661 --> 08:32.299
My dad is a vengeful god who
will strike us down and scatter

08:32.301 --> 08:36.020
our bones to the four
corners of the earth.

08:36.020 --> 08:38.691
It doesn't mean we still
can't have a nice evening.

08:48.586 --> 08:50.408
What's the update on New Hampshire?

08:50.409 --> 08:54.187
15% of the vote is in.
I have a theory the DNC is

08:54.188 --> 08:55.987
holding back some of the results.

08:55.988 --> 09:00.648
They don't want to affect the
numbers in Iowa.

09:02.164 --> 09:04.297
You're not letting that go, huh?

09:05.049 --> 09:07.298
Seriously, how is Buttigieg doing?

09:07.299 --> 09:09.428
You're only asking me
because we're both gay.

09:09.429 --> 09:15.953
No, I just thought you
were really into mayors.

09:16.900 --> 09:20.117
Okay, I'm sorry I made that assumption
that Buttigieg was your candidate.

09:20.118 --> 09:22.528
That was pretty unevolved on my part.

09:23.785 --> 09:27.227
Hey, oh, you're watching the primary?

09:27.228 --> 09:29.463
How is your boyfriend doing?

09:32.450 --> 09:34.163
Wow, Ben.

09:34.164 --> 09:36.867
Some people don't get it, right?

09:37.509 --> 09:39.533
He's an excellent politician,

09:39.534 --> 09:42.727
and qualified to be president.
But he's not necessarily my

09:42.728 --> 09:45.784
candidate just because he's gay.
Did all black people vote for

09:45.785 --> 09:50.433
- Obama?
- Yeah, pretty much.

09:50.434 --> 09:54.207
- About 96%.
- Okay.

09:54.208 --> 09:57.232
Beverly Rose is asleep.
Can I get my baby-sitting money now?

09:57.233 --> 09:58.924
Here you go.

10:01.696 --> 10:03.800
You get the other half if you're

10:03.801 --> 10:06.128
here when I get back.

10:06.416 --> 10:08.370
Fine.

10:10.014 --> 10:12.197
What they thought was
strong performance

10:12.198 --> 10:14.316
by Amy Klobuchar.

10:14.317 --> 10:15.558
Is the primary almost over?

10:15.559 --> 10:18.098
No, but Sanders is doing well.

10:18.099 --> 10:22.635
Some experts think if he wins,
there's a chance he might stop yelling.

10:23.918 --> 10:25.055
It doesn't matter.

10:25.056 --> 10:28.905
Bloomberg just bought the state
and renamed it New Bloomshire.

10:29.552 --> 10:31.631
Is your boyfriend
still in the running?

10:31.703 --> 10:36.147
Oh, my god. If you don't take this

10:36.148 --> 10:38.680
seriously, you get the
government you deserve.

10:38.778 --> 10:39.990
It just so happens that

10:39.991 --> 10:43.887
Pete has a lot of interesting ideas
about health care and a puggle rescue

10:43.888 --> 10:45.232
that is incredibly cute.

10:46.959 --> 10:50.570
Becky, we better get going,
we got to get there before your dad.

10:50.594 --> 10:52.471
It is a dog fight on
the Democratic side.

10:52.495 --> 10:54.075
Bernie Sanders is leading.

10:54.076 --> 10:57.715
Man, Warren could use a boost.

10:57.716 --> 11:00.445
It's nice to have a candidate
who is also a single mom.

11:00.446 --> 11:04.725
She provided child care for the
caucuses last week.

11:04.726 --> 11:08.326
I was this close to flying to
Iowa so I could go to a movie.

11:10.258 --> 11:13.601
If we have to watch this stupid
thing, then let me have the laptop.

11:13.602 --> 11:17.482
- I have to study for my G.E.D.
- What does G.E.D. stand for?

11:17.483 --> 11:20.393
- General Equivalency Degree.
- There, you just passed.

11:21.835 --> 11:24.238
No, you are not even going to study.

11:24.239 --> 11:26.907
You're just going to
take an edible and

11:26.931 --> 11:29.896
then surf the web for
post-ironic t-shirts.

11:31.346 --> 11:33.563
What the hell?

11:36.355 --> 11:38.976
You almost broke my laptop, you psycho.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.598
You don't care about my stuff.

11:41.599 --> 11:44.687
You don't care about
anything but yourself.

11:44.688 --> 11:48.817
- Relax, it's not broken.
- You don't live here.

11:48.818 --> 11:50.114
So why don't you just leave?

11:50.138 --> 11:52.739
And don't say
good-bye this time, either.

11:52.763 --> 11:54.207
What?

11:54.208 --> 11:56.996
- You're mad that I moved out?
- Yeah.

11:56.997 --> 12:01.136
You just walked out and left me
here with these crazy people.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.782
Whoa, hey, hey.
You don't get to make me feel

12:03.783 --> 12:06.520
guilty just because I'm
trying to live my own life.

12:06.521 --> 12:09.525
If you look at our family, you
may not know it, but people are

12:09.526 --> 12:12.383
supposed to move out.

12:12.422 --> 12:15.047
I have no one to talk to now.

12:15.048 --> 12:19.420
I told grandpa I had a boy
crush, and we watched Spartacus

12:19.421 --> 12:23.170
and ate a bucket of fried chicken.

12:23.171 --> 12:25.174
So, you got KFC. What's your problem?

12:26.012 --> 12:28.767
I do have a problem, but it's

12:28.768 --> 12:32.558
a waste of time talking to you.
Screw you!

12:36.182 --> 12:37.971
We only have one TV in the house.

12:37.972 --> 12:40.172
You have to leave.

12:53.255 --> 12:54.605
Oh, hey.

12:54.606 --> 12:58.333
Thanks for offering to close up,
it's pretty dead in here.

12:58.334 --> 13:00.448
I'm going to go home and pack.

13:00.455 --> 13:02.029
Where the hell are D.J. and dad?

13:02.030 --> 13:03.721
Louise is going to leave.

13:03.722 --> 13:04.974
I'll stall her.

13:08.545 --> 13:09.740
Wait!

13:11.728 --> 13:15.237
We're not going to see you for a
while, and I just want to let

13:15.238 --> 13:18.881
you know what an inspiration you
are, all the things you've

13:18.882 --> 13:21.138
taught me.
Like putting rice in the salt

13:21.139 --> 13:22.332
shakers. Thanks.

13:22.333 --> 13:25.877
- Surprise!
- It's your going away party.

13:25.878 --> 13:28.448
- You told me she already left.
- Yes, I did.

13:30.406 --> 13:33.385
This is sweet, but I have to
get home.

13:33.386 --> 13:35.696
Wait, not until we get a good
picture of you.

13:35.697 --> 13:36.826
Yeah, that's a great idea.

13:36.827 --> 13:39.233
That way you'll have a
picture you of Dan you can take

13:39.234 --> 13:42.999
with you on the road because
they change so fast at this age.

13:45.042 --> 13:47.373
Louise, I knew nothing about this.

13:47.374 --> 13:49.796
Hold on a second.
I can't get it off selfie.

13:52.014 --> 13:55.254
Why didn't you tell your
family that we broke up?

13:55.255 --> 13:57.925
Because if I talk to my family,
that encourages them to

13:57.926 --> 14:01.860
- talk back to me.
- Now it's on landscape.

14:01.861 --> 14:05.495
- Hold on.
- All right, look.

14:05.496 --> 14:08.265
Let's not embarrass anybody, get
this over quick, and you can

14:08.266 --> 14:12.505
- tell them when I leave.
- Okay, I got it.

14:12.506 --> 14:15.930
All right, this was great.
But I have to get home.

14:15.931 --> 14:17.824
I'm leaving so early in the morning.

14:17.825 --> 14:20.227
Why go to bed at all?
Let's do some shots.

14:22.125 --> 14:25.883
To Louise, we're going to miss you.

14:25.884 --> 14:27.832
To Louise!

14:27.856 --> 14:31.535
To Dan, who is going to miss Louise.

14:31.536 --> 14:33.905
To Dan!

14:34.317 --> 14:36.743
To Louise and Dan,
who will miss each other.

14:36.744 --> 14:40.328
- To Louise and Dan!
- Darlene, stop.

14:40.329 --> 14:43.038
Okay, dad, then you make a toast.

14:43.039 --> 14:44.636
- To Louise.
- I said stop.

14:44.637 --> 14:47.441
I know what you're doing,
and I don't want to do this.

14:47.442 --> 14:50.833
Louise, wait. Let me drive you home.

14:50.834 --> 14:55.974
No, I need this to end.
And I really need you to leave

14:55.975 --> 15:01.387
me alone. Sorry, guys.

15:09.770 --> 15:12.800
You know, here in the Conner
family, we're not shy about

15:12.801 --> 15:15.644
- telling you how we feel.
- We're telling you, democracy

15:15.645 --> 15:18.347
only works if you get
off your butt and vote.

15:18.348 --> 15:20.909
We're teaming up with I am a
voter to encourage people

15:20.910 --> 15:22.544
to make sure they're registered.

15:22.545 --> 15:25.138
We even make it a family affair
by going to the polls together.

15:25.208 --> 15:27.036
Afterwards,
we go for pizza and have an

15:27.037 --> 15:29.795
embarrassing public
fight about how we voted.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.380
But, you can't make
people feel stupid

15:31.404 --> 15:33.037
about their choice, unless you vote.

15:33.147 --> 15:34.600
Visit iamavoter.com

15:34.601 --> 15:36.713
To double-check your voter
registration and get all

15:36.714 --> 15:40.032
the information you need to be
ready to vote in every election.

15:40.184 --> 15:43.052
The day after the contest is
over is a tough day if you

15:43.053 --> 15:47.210
didn't get any delegates in the
previous state.

15:47.315 --> 15:51.044
If Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden...

15:51.045 --> 15:54.413
Hey.
I checked the primary on my phone.

15:54.414 --> 15:56.047
The older candidates are saying

15:56.048 --> 15:57.987
they have a bigger advantage
over the younger candidates

15:57.988 --> 15:59.247
because they have more experience.

15:59.248 --> 16:02.847
But I say a rap battle at a club
will make it way more fair.

16:02.848 --> 16:07.427
Aunt Jackie is back, she'll
watch the baby now, you can leave.

16:07.428 --> 16:11.385
Look, I'm not going anywhere.
I want to hear about this problem

16:11.386 --> 16:13.321
- you've got.
- You know you are just doing this

16:13.322 --> 16:14.892
because I made you feel guilty.

16:14.982 --> 16:17.609
That's the only reason
anybody does anything good.

16:18.396 --> 16:20.336
Come on, spill the tea.

16:24.806 --> 16:26.460
Remember Austin?

16:26.461 --> 16:28.230
Well, we kind of got together again.

16:28.231 --> 16:32.370
But he ignores me at school
because he doesn't want anyone

16:32.371 --> 16:35.492
to know he's gay.
He even makes fun of me

16:35.493 --> 16:39.380
sometimes, and it makes me
feel really bad about myself.

16:39.381 --> 16:44.500
- But I like him.
- Dump his ass.

16:44.501 --> 16:48.840
But it's not all his fault.
His family just doesn't accept

16:48.841 --> 16:51.330
- him for who he is.
- That doesn't give him the

16:51.331 --> 16:53.320
right to treat you like crap, Mark.

16:53.321 --> 16:56.620
- Boy, bye.
- But...

16:56.621 --> 16:58.470
No. You wanted me back in your life,

16:58.471 --> 17:01.183
you got me back in your life.
From now on, you're running all

17:01.184 --> 17:05.080
- of your boyfriends by me.
- And if you ever get a

17:05.082 --> 17:08.080
boyfriend, you can run him by me.

17:08.082 --> 17:10.968
I'm a strong, independent woman.

17:10.969 --> 17:12.362
Therefore, I'm alone.

17:14.521 --> 17:15.541
Who's ahead?

17:15.542 --> 17:17.513
I don't know. The Bachelor promos at the

17:17.515 --> 17:19.209
bottom of the screen
keep covering it up.

17:19.233 --> 17:22.229
Oh, they moved the rose.

17:22.230 --> 17:27.329
Bernie has 28%. Klobuchar is up to 21%.

17:27.329 --> 17:30.427
And Yang dropped out.
How did the party go?

17:30.428 --> 17:33.438
Well, it was a going away party,
and she certainly went away.

17:36.233 --> 17:41.487
Nice job, you threw a party for
two people who broke up last week.

17:41.488 --> 17:43.774
You broke up? Why didn't you tell us?

17:43.775 --> 17:45.924
Because it's none of your
damn business?

17:45.925 --> 17:49.185
Got it. What happened?

17:51.802 --> 17:54.345
You're never going to stop, are you?

17:54.822 --> 17:58.021
Louise broke up with me because
I wasn't ready to commit.

17:58.022 --> 18:02.611
- And now you've made it worse.
- Don't blame us.

18:02.612 --> 18:04.481
You have been dragging
your feet with her forever.

18:04.482 --> 18:06.591
We were giving you a
chance to make it right.

18:06.592 --> 18:10.192
I was going to make it
right when I was ready.

18:12.463 --> 18:16.302
I've been having a hell of a
time getting over your mom.

18:16.303 --> 18:19.742
- So I went to church.
- You went to church?

18:19.743 --> 18:23.289
Yes, I went to church.
They were having a rummage sale

18:23.290 --> 18:26.959
and I drifted in.
I was looking for a new radio

18:26.960 --> 18:29.509
for the truck, and I figured
nobody is going to screw you in

18:29.510 --> 18:33.438
the church.
The father was there, and I told

18:33.439 --> 18:37.778
- him what was bothering me.
- What did he say?

18:39.019 --> 18:42.576
Don't laugh.
He told me to write a letter to

18:42.577 --> 18:47.216
your mom about how guilty I was
feeling about Louise, and then

18:47.217 --> 18:50.186
set it on fire, so I could let
it go and move on.

18:50.187 --> 18:53.351
- Did you do it?
- No.

18:53.866 --> 18:57.146
I was going to do it in two
weeks on your mom's birthday,

18:57.147 --> 19:00.416
and talk to Louise.
But now it's pointless.

19:00.417 --> 19:02.218
She never wants to see me again.

19:03.256 --> 19:04.399
Oh, come on, dad.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.844
You're just going to give up and
be one of those weird old dudes

19:07.845 --> 19:12.464
that goes to the DMV
to be around people?

19:12.465 --> 19:15.504
Just let us help you.
We can figure something out.

19:15.505 --> 19:18.504
No, we aren't figuring anything out.

19:18.505 --> 19:21.404
I will figure something
out in my way.

19:21.405 --> 19:23.844
- In my time.
- Fine.

19:23.845 --> 19:27.061
It's all you.
When you say in my time, are you

19:27.062 --> 19:30.531
- talking months, years?
- Just give us a ballpark.

19:30.532 --> 19:33.731
- Go to your rooms.
- We're not children.

19:33.732 --> 19:36.092
- You want to pay rent?
- Go, Becky, go!

19:41.329 --> 19:44.170
Bernie Sanders' team will point
out if that were the case...

19:47.698 --> 19:48.803
Hello?

19:48.804 --> 19:54.101
Hi, this is Hillary Clinton
and I'm calling on behalf of the

19:54.102 --> 19:57.314
- Democratic party.
- Stupid robo call.

19:57.315 --> 20:03.000
No, people have accused me of
being a robot, but this is

20:03.001 --> 20:05.512
really Hillary Clinton.

20:05.516 --> 20:06.616
It's her.

20:06.848 --> 20:08.733
She must be trying to
get people to vote.

20:08.734 --> 20:09.768
Hello, hang on.

20:09.792 --> 20:12.561
Let me get where there
is better reception.

20:13.724 --> 20:15.078
Okay, this is better.

20:15.079 --> 20:17.047
Yeah, I see that you just

20:17.048 --> 20:21.087
turned 18, Harris.
And this is a very important

20:21.088 --> 20:24.132
election.
You know, as I gaze upon the

20:24.133 --> 20:28.702
Lincoln Memorial, here in our
nation's capital, I think about

20:28.703 --> 20:34.323
the role of women in this election,
and how we're stronger together.

20:35.585 --> 20:37.360
Hey, while you're in the

20:37.361 --> 20:41.643
nation's capital,
would you mind cleaning the lint trap?

20:43.191 --> 20:46.508
Ah! Harris, just vote.

20:46.509 --> 20:48.178
- Why?
- Because some of these people

20:48.179 --> 20:52.571
are trying to help you.
Warren and Sanders want to pay

20:52.572 --> 20:56.452
your college tuition.
Yang wants to give you $1,000 a month.

20:57.456 --> 21:00.305
And Biden wants to
decriminalize marijuana.

21:00.467 --> 21:03.164
Wow, well,
if I ever get to college, I am

21:03.188 --> 21:05.987
going to need some weed
and spending money.

21:06.011 --> 21:08.314
Okay, I'll vote for them.

21:09.793 --> 21:12.736
This country is doomed.
