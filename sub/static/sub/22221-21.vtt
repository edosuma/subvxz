WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:06.792
Ka D'Argo, your son is being
sold in a lot of 10,000 slaves.

00:06.883 --> 00:08.589
Are we gonna rob a bank?
-Yes!

00:08.676 --> 00:13.295
In one container is enough
wealth to buy the entire
shipment of slaves.

00:13.389 --> 00:15.345
Crichton! Seal all exits!

00:15.433 --> 00:17.719
Zhaan!
-The doors are sealed, Aeryn!
What's happening?!

00:17.810 --> 00:19.186
Scorpius must be on to us.

00:19.270 --> 00:20.134
They won't get out.

00:20.229 --> 00:22.140
What the frell did you
put in my head?

00:22.231 --> 00:23.767
A tiny chip.

00:23.858 --> 00:26.315
A tiny seed that's been
growing in your brain.

00:26.402 --> 00:31.942
Scorpy, when he put me in his
chair he did something, and
it's getting worse.

00:32.033 --> 00:35.321
We have done it! We've done it!
We are rich.

00:35.411 --> 00:38.369
As soon as we establish an
exchange rate for these ingots,

00:38.456 --> 00:40.868
we'll know exactly how
rich we really are.

00:40.958 --> 00:42.459
( screams )

00:43.294 --> 00:44.704
They're eating the ship!

00:44.795 --> 00:47.662
Metalites. They consume metal.

00:49.008 --> 00:51.249
There are over 2,000 of those
creatures on board.

00:51.344 --> 00:53.426
We could never kill them
one by one like this.

00:53.512 --> 00:57.801
I can't lose Jothee, not again.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.223
What do you want?

00:59.310 --> 01:00.641
From you, nothing.

01:00.728 --> 01:05.017
But your father would give me
something I want very much.

01:05.107 --> 01:06.483
Surrenderto me.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.478
Orthe boy dies.

01:08.569 --> 01:13.233
Item one, we need a
Bloodtracker.
-Come with me.

01:13.324 --> 01:15.940
Item two, we're gonna have to
pound our way into the
depository.

01:16.035 --> 01:17.650
For that, we need a Sheyang.

01:19.497 --> 01:21.203
Three, we need a Tavloid.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.201
You want the gauntlet,
you take me with it.

01:23.292 --> 01:25.157
And finally, we need the
Zenetan Pirates.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.369
(yelling)

01:28.381 --> 01:29.962
I liked your proposal.

01:30.049 --> 01:31.334
These guys are mercenaries.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.961
We get them, we go in hot,

01:33.052 --> 01:36.385
we kill Scorpius, and we
bring your son back.

01:38.182 --> 01:40.047
You'd burn Moya?

01:40.142 --> 01:41.302
To save her.

01:41.394 --> 01:43.055
233:: :35;
23:: 8:53:23:

01:43.145 --> 01:45.136
Scorpius is going to
kill Jothee.

01:45.231 --> 01:46.516
Crichton:
No, he won't.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.144
Jothee, it's really you!

01:52.321 --> 01:53.231
You win.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.404
As if there was ever any doubt.

02:00.413 --> 02:02.495
And now, on Farscape.

02:05.293 --> 02:07.409
All right, Frankenstein.
Let's get it on.

02:07.503 --> 02:09.164
Get your property out
of my head.

02:09.255 --> 02:11.587
It's controlling you,
isn't it, John?

02:11.674 --> 02:13.835
I don't know what you're
talking about.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.336
In there.

02:15.428 --> 02:17.089
My neural clone.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.715
It forced you to me.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.342
Nothing forced me here.

02:20.433 --> 02:22.799
Annual checkups are essential
to good health.

02:22.893 --> 02:25.976
You're lying, John.
I always know.

02:27.023 --> 02:28.979
Don't worry.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.227
Soon, I'll take the pain away.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.741
This thing in my head,
this chip.

02:37.825 --> 02:42.990
Part of me now wants it
to control me,

02:43.080 --> 02:46.914
so I'm going to go to Scorpy
and have him take it out
before it's too late.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.292
Before I no longer
want it gone.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.371
Goodbye, my friends.

02:55.259 --> 02:58.626
At least by swapping myself for
Jothee I can do you some good.

03:01.307 --> 03:03.298
You see how you misread him?

03:04.393 --> 03:05.894
Yes.

03:07.730 --> 03:10.221
This doesn't change anything.

03:10.316 --> 03:11.476
What's not changed?

03:11.567 --> 03:12.977
The plan.

03:13.069 --> 03:14.400
Why we brought you all here.

03:14.487 --> 03:17.229
Hey, nobody brought me.
I volunteered.

03:17.323 --> 03:20.360
I am the Holy Warrior of Tarou.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.567
Whatever.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.492
All I'm saying to the
rest of you is

03:24.580 --> 03:27.117
that you were willing to go and
save Jothee and instead,

03:27.208 --> 03:28.744
we'll just go and rescue
Crichton.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.699
Excuse me.

03:30.795 --> 03:33.161
You're forgetting one thing.
-What?

03:33.255 --> 03:36.292
We came on this adventure
for one reason.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.999
You said you could pay us.

03:38.094 --> 03:39.129
That's right.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.300
Well, that's true...

03:40.388 --> 03:43.300
Have you any currency now?

03:43.391 --> 03:45.222
Well, um, we did have currency.

03:45.309 --> 03:50.804
Ah, well, what we thought was
currency actually turned into,
um, a creature.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.480
And it, ah, it...
it was alive, and...

03:53.567 --> 03:57.276
we had to burn the ship.
-Yes, yes, yes, I
understand that, girl.

03:57.363 --> 04:00.275
But you see my problem,
don't you?

04:00.366 --> 04:03.483
I don't do anything unless
I get paid.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.535
And since you no longer
have currency...

04:09.291 --> 04:12.283
Moya is now mine.

04:17.383 --> 04:19.294
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

04:19.385 --> 04:22.798
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.550
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

04:25.641 --> 04:29.225
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.061
Help me.

04:30.146 --> 04:31.352
Listen, please.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.225
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:33.315 --> 04:37.604
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

04:37.695 --> 04:40.061
I'm doing everything I can.

04:40.156 --> 04:42.989
I'm just looking for
a way home.

05:05.890 --> 05:07.426
Go on, shoot her.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.560
You're an embarrassment,
Zelkin.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.434
Aeryn!
-You're worse... you're worse
than an embarrassment.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.607
You're an idiot.
-What are you doing?

05:18.694 --> 05:22.607
There are 30,000 containers
in the Shadow Depository
filled with

05:22.698 --> 05:26.486
riches that you could have
but you'd rather point a
gun at a girl.

05:26.577 --> 05:28.192
What are you trying
to do, Aeryn?

05:28.287 --> 05:31.279
Shame me into going with you?
-No.

05:31.373 --> 05:34.206
No, because even if you wanted
to, I wouldn't go into battle
with you now.

05:34.293 --> 05:37.251
Do you know why? Because you're
a coward and an idiot.

05:37.338 --> 05:40.705
What do you think you're going
to get if you steal Moya?

05:40.799 --> 05:44.417
She's a half burned Leviathan.

05:45.763 --> 05:49.676
I mean, you two have to be the
stupidest pirates I've ever met.

05:49.767 --> 05:50.927
We are not stupid!

05:51.018 --> 05:53.680
Jothee:
Hey! What's going on?!

05:53.771 --> 05:56.137
D'Argo:
You all stay where you are
and remain calm!

05:56.232 --> 05:59.065
Everybody, keep calm.

06:00.486 --> 06:02.067
See, Zelkin?

06:02.154 --> 06:03.530
You don't have the numbers.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.696
Get that gun out of my face!

06:12.373 --> 06:14.705
I think this whole idea rots!

06:14.792 --> 06:15.702
I want...

06:15.793 --> 06:17.784
"I want! lwant!"

06:17.878 --> 06:20.255
"My side! Your side!"
All of you, "I want"!

06:20.339 --> 06:22.204
What's the matter with
you, frek face?

06:22.299 --> 06:25.166
Matter? Matter? I'll tell you
"matter." Anti-matter, matter,
matter, matter!

06:25.261 --> 06:29.470
Oh, Scorpius killed 10,000
of my people!

06:29.557 --> 06:32.139
10,000 cast into space!

06:32.226 --> 06:35.593
10,000 souls scream
in my brain.

06:35.688 --> 06:37.895
The chair! The chair!
Remember the chair?

06:37.982 --> 06:41.850
What chair?!
This frek is crazy!

06:41.944 --> 06:44.686
You coming? Do you agree?
Agree?

06:44.780 --> 06:46.896
Will you fight like this
down there?

06:46.991 --> 06:50.449
Of course, of course.
No hands, no hands.

06:50.536 --> 06:52.777
Then I change my mind, Zelkin.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.247
( Rorf growls )

06:54.331 --> 06:57.789
This one has the spirit of the
hunter and not the prey.

06:57.876 --> 07:01.334
But I want currency if I come
and plenty of it.

07:01.422 --> 07:04.129
You'll get it.
You'll all get it.

07:04.216 --> 07:06.673
So, are we agreed? Are we going
down to rescue Crichton?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.045
Pilot:
Aeryn? D'Argo?

07:08.137 --> 07:09.968
Not now, Pilot.
We're negotiating.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.341
But there's a ship approaching.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.344
Is it Scorpius?

07:14.435 --> 07:16.266
No, it's...

07:16.895 --> 07:18.806
...it's Talyn.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.104
Chiana:
Talyn?

07:21.191 --> 07:24.319
Natira:
Scorpius, tell me something.

07:24.403 --> 07:26.644
Why are you so interested
in this human?

07:26.739 --> 07:30.072
There's nothing impressive
about the species.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.532
( Crichton grunts )

07:32.620 --> 07:35.236
Try not to move so much.

07:35.331 --> 07:40.371
One flinch at the wrong time
and this will paralyze you.

07:40.461 --> 07:43.123
It's kind of hard not to
flinch here, Scorpy,

07:43.213 --> 07:46.205
with Frau Bluchertickling
my prostate.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.836
What are you doing to him?

07:47.926 --> 07:49.712
Why don't you just take him and
leave?

07:49.803 --> 07:52.670
I must soften his neural
receptors to see if my clone
in his brain

07:52.765 --> 07:54.801
has reached the information
Ineed.

07:54.892 --> 07:59.226
If I have, then I will call my
Command Carrier back from
battle and be away from you.

07:59.313 --> 08:03.773
See? Flavius Scorpius here
wants to visit foreign lands,

08:03.859 --> 08:06.521
meet foreign people
and conquer them.

08:06.612 --> 08:09.354
You overestimate me, John.

08:09.448 --> 08:11.905
I have no desire to dominate
the universe.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.368
But know this.

08:13.452 --> 08:16.569
The wormhole technology
in your brain

08:16.664 --> 08:19.155
will sway the balance of power
as we know it.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.286
Imagine, the ability to move
an army in an instant.

08:22.378 --> 08:26.371
The power to make hostile
planets disappear.

08:26.465 --> 08:27.124
( low tone )

08:27.216 --> 08:28.956
(gasps )

08:29.051 --> 08:32.418
Pilot:
Crais, we are very thankful
that you allowed Talyn

08:32.513 --> 08:34.970
to respond to her mother's
distress call.

08:35.057 --> 08:40.643
Eight entire tiers are burnt
and Moya's immune levels are
falling to critical.

08:40.729 --> 08:44.096
Crais:
The nutrients that Talyn's
supplying should start to heal Moya.

08:44.191 --> 08:48.355
Keep a check on the electrocell
levels. They mustn't rise
above six parts.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.310
I'm well aware of that.

08:50.406 --> 08:53.318
How much longer will Talyn
remain linked to Moya?

08:53.409 --> 08:54.319
Two arns.

08:54.410 --> 08:55.695
And then you'll be leaving?

08:55.786 --> 08:57.651
There's little more that
Talyn can do.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.907
Is there some reason you
wish us to stay?

09:04.586 --> 09:10.172
We are planning to attack
the Shadow Depository on
the planet below us.

09:10.259 --> 09:12.921
And you want Talyn to help?

09:13.011 --> 09:15.343
Scorpius is in the depository.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.383
Tempting.

09:17.474 --> 09:20.136
I thought that you didn't want
to use Talyn for violence.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.967
You all said that from
the beginning.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.347
Yes, but this is different.

09:23.439 --> 09:26.306
How? Is this violence more
acceptable because it's for you?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.356
No, it's because Scorpius
has captured Crichton

09:28.444 --> 09:31.436
and he's going to kill him if
we don't get down there.

09:31.530 --> 09:34.738
There's always a reason
for violence, Aeryn.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.191
Thousands of people die for
the most virtuous causes.

09:37.286 --> 09:39.368
You don't have to
lecture me, Crais.

09:39.455 --> 09:41.161
I believe I do.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.411
You've lectured me
countless times.

09:46.378 --> 09:49.245
How long has Scorpius
held Crichton?

09:50.257 --> 09:53.374
Four arns.

09:53.469 --> 09:58.054
Then I recommend you bring down
a basket without any holes

09:58.140 --> 10:02.304
so that Crichton's liquid
remains are not lost.

10:02.394 --> 10:05.056
He's already dead, Aeryn.

10:10.527 --> 10:17.239
Stark:
And all the doors are
cross-synchronized so when you're here, I'm here.

10:17.326 --> 10:22.491
And everything's perfectly
timed because we're on a silent
count, right? Right?

10:23.415 --> 10:24.791
Right?!

10:24.875 --> 10:26.661
You pay attention!
( growls )

10:26.752 --> 10:31.121
If one piece of this plan fails
then the entire plan fails.

10:31.215 --> 10:32.955
You got it? You got it?!

10:33.050 --> 10:36.463
Look, all I understand is that
I'm going down first.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.259
With Bekhesh.

10:38.347 --> 10:41.214
Great. We're going down,
while you all stay up here
out of danger.

10:41.308 --> 10:46.928
You're the tracker. You must
locate Crichton before
we risk ourselves.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.762
( growls )

10:48.857 --> 10:51.064
What are you doing
with that head?

10:51.151 --> 10:55.064
He's an old enemy. I like that
he doesn't talk back.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.111
(snons)

10:57.199 --> 11:00.566
As soon as you locate Crichton,
then the rest of us will
follow straight down.

11:00.661 --> 11:04.279
And then Teurac and I will
destroy their generator.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.238
How come I don't get thatjob?

11:06.333 --> 11:10.201
Because you can't produce
a fireball that burns
at 7,000 klances.

11:10.295 --> 11:14.459
How will I know when to start
burning the generator?

11:14.550 --> 11:19.010
I told you! We'll all be on
a silent count for the
entire battle!

11:19.096 --> 11:21.007
A-A silent count?

11:21.098 --> 11:22.213
While we're fighting?

11:22.307 --> 11:23.137
Yes, it's easy.

11:23.225 --> 11:26.058
It's complicated.
( sighs )

11:26.478 --> 11:27.558
What do they do?

11:27.646 --> 11:30.262
Stark:
The Zenetans will deploy
the Flax.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.190
The Flix? What the frell
is the Flix?

11:33.277 --> 11:37.145
The Flax is a net that will
trap any ship coming after you.

11:37.239 --> 11:39.821
A net? Oh, I see. They stay up
here opening a net

11:39.908 --> 11:42.149
while I'm down there
risking my life?!

11:42.244 --> 11:47.830
What's the point of a plan if
you don't get away at the end,
pack animal?

12:04.975 --> 12:07.216
D'Argo:
Do you know what that is?

12:09.438 --> 12:12.180
No. What is it?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.936
It's, uh...

12:15.027 --> 12:18.110
it's your blood ancestor's
Qualta Blade.

12:18.196 --> 12:21.404
My father's father used it in
the Siege of Repmek.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.868
You're kidding me?
You fought with this?

12:23.952 --> 12:25.613
It weighs a drackik.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.162
It's perfectly balanced.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.035
I still use it myself.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.371
I'm, uh...

12:38.842 --> 12:41.424
I'm sorry that we
haven't spoken.

12:41.511 --> 12:42.717
Don't be sorry.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.931
I don't know what
to say either.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.471
Who did this to you?
Who mutilated you?

12:56.234 --> 12:58.646
You did.

12:58.737 --> 13:02.821
In a way, you've done
everything that ever
happened to me.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.773
Jothee...

13:06.286 --> 13:07.662
Son...

13:09.831 --> 13:11.822
I had to send you away.

13:11.917 --> 13:15.000
After your uncle accused me
of killing your mother...

13:15.087 --> 13:17.328
I'm not angry with you.

13:19.049 --> 13:23.167
But what's going on
in this ship...

13:23.261 --> 13:25.547
you don't expect me to help you
save Crichton, do you?

13:26.306 --> 13:27.762
I thought you would want to.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.805
Listen!

13:29.893 --> 13:31.849
I'm interested in saving myself.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.724
For ten cycles I've been
running, trying to survive.

13:34.815 --> 13:37.852
I realize that. I want to know
everything that has happened
to you in your life...

13:37.943 --> 13:39.353
No, no! You don't want to know!

13:39.444 --> 13:42.607
Believe me you don't
want to know.

13:42.698 --> 13:47.988
l have done things, many things
I'm not proud of to survive.

13:49.121 --> 13:52.705
Now... I... I don't want
to shame you,

13:52.791 --> 13:56.579
but I am not going back
to that planet.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.377
I only just got my freedom back.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.206
I'm not going to risk
losing it again.

14:04.094 --> 14:07.131
There. He's ready now.

14:08.557 --> 14:11.173
Oh, don't stop now, Scorpy.

14:11.268 --> 14:14.180
Roll me over and baste
the other side.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.557
Are you going to take out
the implant?

14:16.648 --> 14:18.309
No.

14:19.735 --> 14:21.896
I'm going in.

14:21.987 --> 14:22.646
( low tone )

14:22.738 --> 14:24.274
(gasps )

14:28.368 --> 14:30.575
What the hell?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.412
This is Sawyer's Mill.

14:39.963 --> 14:44.127
My dad used to bring me fishing
here when l was a kid.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.004
This is a place inside
your memory, John.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.753
A place in your brain.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.133
In my brain?

14:51.224 --> 14:57.015
Yes. We're inside your brain,
and no, I'm not Scorpius.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.221
But he is.

14:59.316 --> 15:01.022
Hello, John.

15:02.986 --> 15:06.649
Have you obtained the
wormhole information?

15:06.740 --> 15:09.482
I believe I've burrowed
far enough.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.658
The information was well
hidden by the Ancients.

15:11.745 --> 15:15.658
I suspect even Crichton is
unaware of the specifics.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.865
Is he ready to have the
chip removed?

15:17.959 --> 15:19.415
Oh, yes.

15:19.503 --> 15:22.415
I'll call my Command Carrier.

15:22.506 --> 15:27.967
When we reach my ship and
I remove my neural clone,

15:28.720 --> 15:30.927
your death will be painless.

15:31.473 --> 15:34.180
Screw this.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.598
(grunts loudly)

15:39.231 --> 15:41.347
I can't move.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.186
God, I can't move.

15:50.492 --> 15:53.325
I'm sorry Aeryn. You're wasting
your time if you came
here to beg.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.116
Not begging.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.740
Choose your own word.

15:55.831 --> 15:58.868
Look, Crais, we're all going to
die if you don't help us.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.120
Will other lives be lost
in this attack?

16:01.211 --> 16:03.418
You can have anything you want.
Anything.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.164
Aeryn Sun...

16:07.259 --> 16:09.625
are you... offering yourself?

16:14.141 --> 16:18.305
Crichton, if he's alive,

16:18.395 --> 16:21.478
must mean a great deal to you.

16:21.565 --> 16:24.898
You can take what you want
and I won't stop you.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.199
ldon't want you to think
I'm a coward.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.578
ldont

16:44.421 --> 16:48.334
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.632
I was wrong to ask you
to join us in battle.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.050
It's not your fight.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.093
No, Father.

16:54.181 --> 16:57.389
If it's your fight then
it's mine, too.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.261
Thank you.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.217
Ka D'Argo.

17:04.774 --> 17:07.607
We need to talk.
About the plan.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.559
Not again.

17:11.281 --> 17:18.778
Pilot, would you mind telling
these fools what we talked
about earlier?

17:18.872 --> 17:23.366
D'argo advised me to
auto-program the
Maintenance Bay.

17:23.460 --> 17:27.373
If you try to mutiny, the
chamber will fill with benon gas

17:27.464 --> 17:29.705
and render you unconscious.

17:30.884 --> 17:34.752
We have no desire to die,
Ka D'argo.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.882
But you are a warrior.

17:36.973 --> 17:40.261
You must admit, this plan
seems, uh...

17:40.352 --> 17:41.808
flawed.

17:42.646 --> 17:44.853
It's more than flawed.

17:44.940 --> 17:47.101
It's frelled.

17:47.192 --> 17:48.898
And that is why I say we
should forget about it.

17:48.985 --> 17:55.106
Forget it? You think they're
just going to let us walk in
down there?

17:56.534 --> 17:59.617
Pilot, is Moya well enough to
do us one more favor?

17:59.704 --> 18:02.036
What kind of favor?

18:02.123 --> 18:05.160
A low-level maneuver through
atmosphere.

18:05.252 --> 18:09.837
I think she might be able
to manage it once.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.164
I'll ask her.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.420
This is what I think we
should do.

18:14.511 --> 18:17.628
Moya should prove a
distraction.

18:17.722 --> 18:21.385
Then we go down there, burst
through the front doors and
storm the place.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.683
It's what we do best.

18:27.357 --> 18:30.269
Are you ready to go down now,
and save Crichton?

18:30.360 --> 18:32.442
But we all heard his
transmission.

18:33.613 --> 18:37.071
What if Crichton's worse
and won't be rescued?

18:37.993 --> 18:41.030
Well, that's easy.

18:41.121 --> 18:44.613
I put a bullet in Crichton's
head and end it.

18:46.710 --> 18:50.578
The Command Carrier is arriving
six arns earlier than
expected, sir.

18:50.672 --> 18:52.628
Well, that's too bad.

18:52.716 --> 18:55.753
I thought you wanted to leave
as soon as possible.

18:55.844 --> 19:00.429
I do, but, uh... good news.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.140
I'm always suspicious
of good news.

19:04.227 --> 19:10.063
Hey, Scorpy, why don't you
cut me down? Isn't torture
time over?

19:10.150 --> 19:13.938
I don't torture people, John.
You misunderstand me.

19:14.029 --> 19:17.692
Now that my neural clone has
reached the information
that I need,

19:17.782 --> 19:19.693
I'll remove it.

19:19.784 --> 19:22.571
As soon as my Command Carrier
arrives.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.323
It seems...

19:25.040 --> 19:26.655
( groans )

19:26.750 --> 19:28.581
Crichton:
Oh, what's the matter?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.784
Got a little warm head?

19:30.879 --> 19:34.121
How about I change that rod
for ya? I got some spares.

19:34.215 --> 19:37.628
Natira, lock this chamber down.

19:37.719 --> 19:40.426
Open it for no one but me.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.214
I'll do it.

19:49.230 --> 19:54.350
Human, you are surprising.

19:54.444 --> 19:59.404
I've never seen Scorpius worry
about anyone as much as you.

20:00.158 --> 20:02.274
Don't be jealous, Frau BI cher.

20:03.661 --> 20:06.448
He only loves me for my mind.

20:08.500 --> 20:12.243
You know, you should come in
and visit some time.

20:12.337 --> 20:15.579
Why would I ever want to
go inside you?

20:19.177 --> 20:25.138
So the Scorpius in my head can
tell you exactly how he's
going to kill you.

20:26.976 --> 20:31.686
Well, I can tell you, you're
about to taste blood.

20:37.278 --> 20:38.779
(gagging )

20:40.365 --> 20:42.276
Was that good for you?

20:42.367 --> 20:44.028
Yes.

20:51.751 --> 20:55.118
Rorf:
Moya? Anyone?

20:56.673 --> 20:58.629
How does this frelling
thing work?

20:58.716 --> 21:02.208
Rygel:
I hear you, Bloodtracker.

21:02.303 --> 21:05.466
We're just outside the
depository and yes,
you were right.

21:05.557 --> 21:08.799
The guards aren't looking for
a Vocarian or a Tavlek.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.633
Can you smell Crichton?

21:10.728 --> 21:11.763
No, but...

21:11.855 --> 21:12.640
Why not?

21:12.730 --> 21:13.981
Well, it's just...

21:14.065 --> 21:16.101
The problem is he's
a lousy tracker.

21:16.192 --> 21:19.150
It seems smelling is
a female's job.

21:19.237 --> 21:21.193
Oh, frell!

21:21.281 --> 21:24.899
I don't want to hear excuses.
Just find Crichton.

21:24.993 --> 21:26.278
You're no help, Bekhesh!

21:26.369 --> 21:28.234
Why don't you frell off? Hmm?

21:28.329 --> 21:31.287
lwould've found him by now if
it wasn't for you clumping
around behind me.

21:31.374 --> 21:33.490
Fine. From now on, you're
on your own.

21:33.585 --> 21:34.950
(snons)

21:38.298 --> 21:40.209
( puffing )

21:42.886 --> 21:48.131
(wheezing and puffing )

21:54.314 --> 21:55.850
What's the matter, Teurac?

21:55.940 --> 21:58.352
Uh, nothing.

22:02.697 --> 22:04.528
Can you produce flame?

22:04.616 --> 22:06.481
Of course.

22:09.329 --> 22:13.117
I will not let you endanger
the rest of us.

22:13.208 --> 22:16.291
Stark's plan depends upon your
ability to produce flame.

22:16.377 --> 22:20.916
If you cannot, I must warn
the others.

22:21.007 --> 22:24.841
No! I still have flame
nutrients,

22:24.928 --> 22:28.762
but can no longer tap
into them.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.429
Unless...

22:31.434 --> 22:32.719
Unless what?

22:32.810 --> 22:37.224
If you have Taakar serum...

22:37.315 --> 22:39.180
But that's poison.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.102
Pilot.

22:45.073 --> 22:46.313
Pilot!

22:46.407 --> 22:48.659
Answer this frelling thing,
will you?

22:48.743 --> 22:51.234
Ah, I'm sorry, Rorf.

22:51.329 --> 22:54.617
I've been training all my
sensors on healing Moya.

22:54.707 --> 22:59.041
I got through the waste vents
and Crichton's on the level
above the main chamber.

22:59.128 --> 23:00.254
He's...

23:01.047 --> 23:02.958
( snarling )

23:04.801 --> 23:07.543
Rorf? Rorf?

23:09.222 --> 23:11.178
I told you.

23:11.266 --> 23:15.259
ldon't know this human.

23:15.979 --> 23:17.844
Scorpius:
Bounty hunter.

23:17.939 --> 23:19.600
Why are you here?

23:19.691 --> 23:24.310
Well, I was planning to
make a deposit.

23:24.404 --> 23:25.769
(laughing)

23:25.863 --> 23:28.195
A deposit of what? Fur lice?

23:28.283 --> 23:29.398
Natira:
Akkor.

23:29.492 --> 23:30.993
Back away and shut up.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.066
I'm just doing...

23:32.161 --> 23:33.287
Back away now.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.998
Bounty hunter.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.715
This is the last time I will
ask.

23:48.511 --> 23:51.253
What are you doing here?

23:51.347 --> 23:53.508
Get frelled.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.932
You know what I was doing.

23:56.019 --> 23:59.307
l was casing the joint for
Zenetan pirates.

23:59.397 --> 24:05.358
I didn't know you were here,
and I don't know who he is.

24:05.445 --> 24:08.562
Zenetan Pirates.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.863
Please, allow me to
question the animal.

24:10.950 --> 24:14.158
Sometimes a female's touch...

24:19.250 --> 24:20.660
You should have answered me.

24:20.752 --> 24:21.662
( snarling )

24:21.753 --> 24:23.368
I was trying to save you.

24:28.551 --> 24:32.214
Animal, you have lovely eyes.

24:32.305 --> 24:35.092
I love red eyes.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.928
Very sensual.

24:38.019 --> 24:39.600
Very unusual.

24:42.357 --> 24:47.226
Animal, what are you
doing here?

24:47.320 --> 24:48.309
I told you...

24:48.404 --> 24:50.269
Do not lie again.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.741
Who were you communicating to?

24:52.825 --> 24:55.988
And what is the plan
to free the human?

24:56.079 --> 24:57.615
A plan?

24:57.705 --> 25:00.617
ldon't know of any plan.

25:01.417 --> 25:02.532
Animal,

25:04.003 --> 25:07.461
I love your eyes so much.

25:08.299 --> 25:10.631
Your lying eyes.

25:12.303 --> 25:15.215
( Rorf screaming )

25:17.225 --> 25:19.762
(howling in pain)

25:19.852 --> 25:22.514
That's all I know.

25:22.605 --> 25:27.690
They plan to destroy the
generator then attack
in the darkness.

25:27.777 --> 25:30.189
Darkness is the key.

25:30.279 --> 25:33.237
Please don't take my other eye.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.860
(whimpering)

25:37.829 --> 25:44.200
Natira, my senses tell me that
this animal is telling
the truth.

25:44.293 --> 25:45.954
Braca, come with me.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.957
If we secure the generator
their plan will fail.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.584
We have to be fast.

25:50.675 --> 25:54.133
Once we land on the planet
Moya's going to run a
distraction.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.963
Teurac, Zhaan and Stark, I
want you to go through the
waste vents,

25:58.057 --> 26:01.174
into the depository and
destroy the generators.

26:01.269 --> 26:03.305
Aeryn and I will meet up
with Bekhesh.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.261
Once the power is gone we'll
be able to storm

26:05.356 --> 26:08.223
through the center chamber
doors and rescue Crichton.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.568
What about me? I thought
I was going too.

26:09.652 --> 26:11.768
You're going to stay here on
the Transport Pod with Rygel.

26:11.863 --> 26:15.481
I said I'd go.
That's why I'm here.
-Look, it is not your fight.

26:15.575 --> 26:18.692
I've lost you once before.
I'm not going to lose you again.

26:20.705 --> 26:24.243
Braca, while I secure the
generator,

26:24.333 --> 26:27.200
get to the monitor and be
my eyes and ears.

26:27.295 --> 26:28.910
Yes, sir.

26:29.005 --> 26:30.415
Tell me.

26:32.216 --> 26:35.333
Is there a back way
to the generator?
-Yes.

26:35.428 --> 26:38.170
Pilot, we'll be touching down
on the planet in 30 microts.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.346
Pilot:
Good luck, Aeryn.

26:40.433 --> 26:41.798
Good luck to you all.

26:41.893 --> 26:43.303
Thank you, Pilot.

26:43.394 --> 26:47.307
Rygel, I'm handing control
over to you... now.

26:47.398 --> 26:49.059
Let's do it.

26:50.401 --> 26:52.266
Starting descent... now.

26:52.361 --> 26:56.400
Chiana, tell the Zenetans to
prepare for a low level
maneuver.

26:56.491 --> 26:58.322
You got it, Pilot.

27:02.997 --> 27:04.908
Blue Eyes.

27:05.833 --> 27:08.290
Look out at that.

27:09.337 --> 27:13.330
That is the last sight your
eyes will ever see.

27:13.424 --> 27:16.257
You are a sick puppy.

27:16.344 --> 27:20.883
Scorpius has to kill me,
and you're still getting
yourjollies.

27:20.973 --> 27:24.340
Oh, he doesn't... he doesn't
have to kill you, Blue Eyes.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.391
What?

27:26.479 --> 27:30.813
He... He can get the chip out
without hurting me?

27:31.692 --> 27:33.432
Oh, yes.

27:35.530 --> 27:39.193
First red, now blue.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.861
Scorpius wants your brain.

27:44.956 --> 27:47.948
He said nothing about
your eyes.

27:49.043 --> 27:50.249
Blue eyes...

27:51.420 --> 27:53.411
So soft...

27:53.798 --> 27:56.335
Very rare...

27:56.425 --> 27:57.505
(explosions)

27:57.593 --> 27:59.208
What the frell is that?

28:01.722 --> 28:03.303
That's Moya.

28:09.105 --> 28:10.936
( exultant cry)

28:11.023 --> 28:13.685
You're clear to land, Rygel.
Get in there now.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.486
Sir, we have a problem.

28:32.420 --> 28:33.660
Now!

28:38.134 --> 28:39.920
Bekhesh, take out the camera.

28:43.973 --> 28:45.964
Scorpius:
Mobilize every
available soldier.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.891
Have them stand by outside
the main chamber.

28:59.572 --> 29:03.611
Oh, dear, dear, dear.
What has Moya done here?

29:03.701 --> 29:07.114
You are so screwed, Medusa!

29:07.204 --> 29:11.243
I'll tell you what. You get me
out of here, I'll help you
stay alive.

29:11.334 --> 29:14.246
Why do you want to escape
now, human?

29:14.337 --> 29:19.047
You just told me that I could
get the chip out of my head
without dying!

29:19.133 --> 29:22.170
When you get me out of here,
I'll give you the damn chip.

29:22.261 --> 29:25.128
Hell, you can have the
wormhole technology.

29:25.222 --> 29:27.679
As a bonus, you can have
one of my eyes.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.883
Let us go, you bitch!

29:29.977 --> 29:31.888
(yelling)

29:35.024 --> 29:36.230
The generator's this way.

29:36.317 --> 29:37.477
Quick.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.865
Teurac, that's the generator.

29:46.953 --> 29:48.159
Burn it!

29:48.245 --> 29:50.657
Give me the Taakar serum.

29:50.748 --> 29:52.659
Give it to me now.

29:52.750 --> 29:55.366
Are you sure? It's seven units.
It's a lethal dose.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.871
Not for us.

29:56.963 --> 29:59.625
Younger Sheyangs have
survived nine.

29:59.715 --> 30:03.048
Give it to me!
There is no other way.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.279
We have to get that
frelling gun.

30:34.458 --> 30:36.073
Okay.

30:40.047 --> 30:41.207
(grunts)

30:44.343 --> 30:45.753
(empty click)

30:51.100 --> 30:52.215
Good shot.

30:52.309 --> 30:55.392
I was aiming for between
his eyes.

30:58.190 --> 31:02.308
Teurac, what's taking so long?
You have to destroy the
generator now.

31:03.070 --> 31:05.561
I'm trying.

31:05.656 --> 31:07.032
My chest...

31:07.116 --> 31:11.780
the fuel is there, but I
can't reach it.

31:11.871 --> 31:14.362
You must hurry.
They'll be here soon.

31:14.457 --> 31:16.197
Scorpius:
I'm here already, Zhaan.

31:16.292 --> 31:17.452
Guards:
Hold it there. Don't resist.

31:18.294 --> 31:19.704
Put the weapon down.

31:20.921 --> 31:23.412
Put the weapon down now!

31:25.217 --> 31:26.957
Why hasn't the power gone off?

31:27.053 --> 31:29.544
It's that frelling Sheyang.
He couldn't do it.

31:29.638 --> 31:32.254
I knew I shouldn't have
trusted him.

31:34.393 --> 31:37.055
Do you think there's anyone on
the other side of this door?

31:43.402 --> 31:44.778
Are we going to do this or not?

31:44.862 --> 31:46.773
I don't know if we have
any other choice.

31:46.864 --> 31:47.774
None whatsoever.

31:47.865 --> 31:48.820
Natira.

31:48.908 --> 31:51.115
Natira, why aren't you
answering me?

31:51.202 --> 31:53.158
Scorpius!

31:55.372 --> 31:57.704
Don't worry about her.

31:57.792 --> 31:59.908
Worry about me.

32:00.002 --> 32:01.993
Shoot him.
-No. No, don't.

32:03.339 --> 32:04.624
He's a Sheyang.

32:04.715 --> 32:06.000
That's right.

32:06.092 --> 32:09.926
I'll explode if you shoot me.

32:10.012 --> 32:11.627
Goodbye, Zhaan.

32:11.722 --> 32:14.259
This is not your fault.

32:14.350 --> 32:17.808
I always knew it had to
end like this.

32:17.895 --> 32:19.101
Teurac!

32:19.188 --> 32:21.179
( screaming )
-No!

32:35.746 --> 32:37.532
( power shutting down )

32:37.623 --> 32:39.488
They did it.
They killed the power.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.835
You two go to night vision.

32:42.837 --> 32:44.623
I can't see. Mine's not working.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.288
Just shoot!

33:20.416 --> 33:22.031
Wait.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.211
I think I did it.

33:27.298 --> 33:30.256
My night visions are
finally working.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.719
(powering up)

33:34.597 --> 33:37.259
For someone who couldn't see,
you did okay.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.214
( screaming )

33:39.310 --> 33:40.265
Braca...

33:40.352 --> 33:41.683
Braca, can you see Crichton?

33:41.770 --> 33:43.852
No, the monitor's gone dead.

33:43.939 --> 33:46.931
Then get me some emergency
power now!

33:47.026 --> 33:48.266
Natira?

33:48.360 --> 33:50.316
Natira, I know you're listening.

33:50.404 --> 33:51.735
If you're betraying me,

33:51.822 --> 33:53.904
if anything happens
to Crichton...

33:53.991 --> 33:56.607
Come on, Natira, you'd better
make up your mind quick!

33:56.702 --> 33:58.533
Scorpius:
Answer me.
-Scorpy's gonna kill you

33:58.621 --> 34:00.828
no matter what happens here.

34:00.915 --> 34:02.200
You don't believe me?

34:02.291 --> 34:05.954
Go in my head and ask the clone
how you're gonna die.

34:06.045 --> 34:07.535
Ask him!

34:16.263 --> 34:18.299
Natira, ask him.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.301
Where is he?

34:20.392 --> 34:22.303
I'm here, Natira.

34:23.395 --> 34:24.555
Tell me...

34:24.647 --> 34:27.389
Scorpius would never
harm me, would he?

34:29.235 --> 34:33.774
Now I know why Scorpius found
you so... enticing.

34:34.782 --> 34:37.068
To possess a beauty like you...

34:37.159 --> 34:41.528
To feel... all of this.

34:43.123 --> 34:45.330
Crichton's right.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.248
Scorpius is going to kill me.

34:47.336 --> 34:52.831
Oh, my lovely, how
fortunate you are.

34:52.925 --> 34:55.382
Your death will be painless.

34:58.430 --> 35:03.345
Natira, come get this spike out
of my neck. Forget about him.

35:03.435 --> 35:07.269
If I take it out will you
get me on Moya and away
from Scorpius?

35:07.356 --> 35:09.221
Do we have a deal?

35:12.111 --> 35:13.442
Where is Crichton?

35:13.529 --> 35:15.394
You said he was here!

35:15.489 --> 35:17.320
This is where Rorf said
he would be.

35:17.408 --> 35:18.363
They must have moved him.

35:18.450 --> 35:19.986
Obviously.

35:20.077 --> 35:22.819
There's a way out on the lower
level. We must move faster.

35:22.913 --> 35:24.528
What's the matter, Crichton?

35:24.623 --> 35:26.955
I can't get Scorpius out of
my head and he's not
gonna let me go!

35:27.042 --> 35:28.373
Don't push him, bitch!

35:28.460 --> 35:30.917
Just stop it!
-Don't tell me to stop it.

35:31.005 --> 35:33.291
She took out my eye!

35:33.382 --> 35:34.542
Peacekeepers!

35:37.094 --> 35:39.585
We're on our way to the pickup
point, Rygel. Come and
get us now.

35:39.680 --> 35:40.886
On our way, Zhaan.

35:40.973 --> 35:43.214
Out of the way, you slug.
I'm gonna...

35:43.309 --> 35:46.801
Intruders in the landing bay.
Get a squadron up there now.

35:46.895 --> 35:49.807
Braca. Braca, signal the
Zenetan Pirates.

35:50.941 --> 35:52.556
Zelkin, deploy the Flax.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.939
I repeat, deploy the Flax.
-Zelkin, who you speaking to?

35:56.947 --> 35:58.938
Is that a Comm?

35:59.033 --> 36:00.898
Hey, easy, easy girl.

36:00.993 --> 36:03.200
Oh, I didn't know you cared.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.287
Kurz, release the Flax.

36:07.374 --> 36:08.830
( screaming )

36:13.255 --> 36:14.756
Why the frell aren't we moving?

36:14.840 --> 36:17.252
It's the Flax. We're trapped.

36:17.343 --> 36:21.336
Neural clone:
You'll never get away
from me, John. -Let go!

36:23.015 --> 36:24.380
Go away. You're not real.

36:24.475 --> 36:27.182
Neural clone:
You'll never get away
from me, John.

36:27.269 --> 36:28.805
Go away Scorpius!

36:28.896 --> 36:29.476
Move it!

36:29.563 --> 36:31.178
Scorpius!

36:31.273 --> 36:33.730
Don't shoot Crichton.
I need him alive.

36:33.817 --> 36:35.318
Crichton, get back!

36:35.402 --> 36:38.394
There's no escape, John.
No escape, John.

36:39.323 --> 36:41.609
No!

36:41.700 --> 36:43.110
(yelling)

36:43.202 --> 36:44.191
(growling)

36:44.286 --> 36:46.743
(yelling)

36:46.830 --> 36:48.115
Let's go!

36:48.207 --> 36:49.242
We have a deal, Crichton.

36:49.333 --> 36:50.197
Rorg!

36:50.292 --> 36:52.032
Leave him, John.

36:52.127 --> 36:53.037
Natira:
Come on!

36:53.128 --> 36:55.289
Rorf:
Go! Go!

36:57.966 --> 36:59.502
and come to me.

36:59.593 --> 37:01.094
Crichton!

37:01.178 --> 37:02.588
(yelling)

37:04.556 --> 37:06.387
Take me to Moya.

37:07.810 --> 37:09.675
Frell you, Crichton?

37:10.187 --> 37:12.303
Die alone.

37:37.548 --> 37:38.754
Rorf!

37:47.141 --> 37:49.507
My female! My female!

37:50.436 --> 37:52.552
D'Argo, you must go
back to her.

37:52.646 --> 37:54.682
You must tell her...
-I will. lwill.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.405
They're coming from both sides.
We're trapped.

38:06.577 --> 38:07.987
Rygel?

38:08.370 --> 38:09.951
Rygel?

38:10.038 --> 38:11.619
(yelling)

38:12.207 --> 38:14.323
Why aren't you here?

38:14.418 --> 38:15.248
Rygel!

38:15.335 --> 38:17.246
Zhaan. Is that you, Zhaan?

38:17.337 --> 38:19.589
Crais?

38:19.673 --> 38:21.789
Has Talyn returned?

38:21.884 --> 38:27.379
Sorry about this, but Scorpius
will kill me if I don't hold
Moya for him.

38:36.690 --> 38:38.271
We're free, Chiana!

38:38.358 --> 38:39.939
The Flax has gone.

38:40.027 --> 38:42.769
Kurz? Kurz, what's happening?

38:42.863 --> 38:43.818
Kurz?

38:43.906 --> 38:45.237
Kurz is dead.

38:45.324 --> 38:47.280
Talyn has destroyed your ship.

38:47.367 --> 38:48.823
I'll take Moya then.

38:48.911 --> 38:50.947
You're not taking anything.

39:03.383 --> 39:07.422
Oh, what a waste.

39:39.836 --> 39:40.825
Crais:
Aeryn?

39:42.381 --> 39:44.121
Talyn has just destroyed
the Zenetan ship.

39:44.216 --> 39:46.047
Have you come back to help us?

39:47.177 --> 39:49.384
Let's just say that I'm here.

39:52.975 --> 39:55.136
All right. Hang on a microt.
Stark, Zhaan?

39:55.227 --> 39:57.092
Yes, Aeryn, we're here.

39:57.187 --> 39:59.929
Can you remember from the
blueprints what runs parallel
to the internal corridors?

40:00.023 --> 40:03.311
I think there are reverse
pressurization chambers.

40:03.402 --> 40:04.107
Where do they lead?

40:04.194 --> 40:05.900
To the depository.

40:05.988 --> 40:07.194
Perfect. Rygel?

40:07.281 --> 40:08.236
Yes?

40:08.323 --> 40:10.234
Pick up Zhaan and Stark
in the waste vents,

40:10.325 --> 40:13.112
and come and get us when
Talyn's finished.

40:13.203 --> 40:15.410
Finished with what?
-Don't ask.

40:15.497 --> 40:19.160
Crais, target off my Comms,
and destroy the depository.

40:19.251 --> 40:23.665
Talyn's firepower is
massive, Aeryn.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.211
How will you survive the damage?

40:25.299 --> 40:26.539
We'll be safe.

40:26.633 --> 40:29.215
Just give us 90 microts
and obviously,

40:29.303 --> 40:31.760
try not to hit my signal
with a direct strike.

40:38.478 --> 40:41.140
Neural clone:
Crichton, you want
the chip gone?

40:41.231 --> 40:42.846
All right, follow me.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.273
Follow you where?
-Here.

40:47.904 --> 40:51.271
You want the pain gone?
Come to me.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.231
Go down to the depository.
Hide in a container.

40:55.162 --> 40:57.494
Should?
-Have you got a better idea?

40:57.581 --> 40:59.162
Well...

40:59.249 --> 41:01.626
Aeryn, I'm, uh...

41:01.710 --> 41:03.496
I'm going to go to Scorpius.

41:03.587 --> 41:05.168
Frell you are.

41:05.255 --> 41:06.165
D'Argo...

41:06.256 --> 41:07.496
carry him!

41:16.183 --> 41:19.175
It's what Aeryn wants
us to do, Pilot.

41:19.269 --> 41:21.510
Destroy the entire building.

41:23.190 --> 41:25.101
This way!

41:26.526 --> 41:27.982
It's frelling locked!

41:28.070 --> 41:30.231
They're in the depositing room.

41:31.531 --> 41:33.988
Zhaan, I think we've
got company.

41:34.076 --> 41:35.236
Rygel! Rygel!

41:35.327 --> 41:36.817
Almost there, Zhaan.

41:38.872 --> 41:40.078
Move.

41:42.959 --> 41:44.495
Right! Into the container.

41:44.586 --> 41:47.202
I didn't plan on becoming
a deposit.

41:47.297 --> 41:49.754
Rygel:
Touching down now, Zhaan.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.377
Let's go! Come on!

41:52.678 --> 41:56.512
Talyn firing in 20 microts.

41:56.598 --> 41:58.463
Locking on now.

41:58.558 --> 42:02.597
Talyn firing in 15 microts.

42:02.688 --> 42:05.680
All right, they're in! Let's
go! Go! Go! Move! Move! Move!

42:11.321 --> 42:12.857
Wait for my signal.

42:13.824 --> 42:15.360
Ten microts.

42:16.368 --> 42:17.949
Nine...

42:18.036 --> 42:19.151
Eight...

42:19.246 --> 42:20.326
Seven...

42:20.414 --> 42:21.529
Six...

42:21.623 --> 42:22.829
Five...

42:22.916 --> 42:23.996
Four...

42:24.084 --> 42:24.948
Three...

42:25.043 --> 42:26.123
Two...

42:26.211 --> 42:27.621
One.

42:28.839 --> 42:30.045
Fire.

42:44.479 --> 42:47.346
Mine, mine, mine.
(laughing)

42:48.108 --> 42:49.314
Can I have this?

42:49.401 --> 42:50.891
Can this be mine?

42:50.986 --> 42:53.147
We can all have anything
we want now, right?

42:53.238 --> 42:55.229
Any food, any female, anything?

42:55.323 --> 42:57.188
Right? Right!

42:57.617 --> 42:59.118
Yeah.

42:59.202 --> 43:01.579
Oh, don't be like them.

43:01.663 --> 43:04.530
You're like me, Chiana.
We did it!

43:04.624 --> 43:06.239
This is not like before.

43:06.334 --> 43:07.323
This won't eat the ship.

43:07.419 --> 43:08.784
So cheer up.

43:08.879 --> 43:12.087
We got Crichton back and Aeryn
and D'Argo and Jothee,

43:12.174 --> 43:13.630
and we're rich.

43:13.717 --> 43:14.706
Perfect.

43:14.801 --> 43:17.543
Yes, but Moya is still
extremely ill.

43:17.637 --> 43:19.844
Pilot says that she may
never fully recover.

43:19.931 --> 43:22.593
And Rorf and Teurac
lost their lives.

43:22.684 --> 43:24.970
So? They knew the risks.

43:25.061 --> 43:26.892
Don't worry about Rorf
and Teurac.

43:26.980 --> 43:30.313
On my oath, I will deliver
their shares to their families.

43:30.859 --> 43:32.099
Farewell, my friends.

43:32.194 --> 43:34.310
And thank you for teaching me
to kill again.

43:37.824 --> 43:39.200
I have to thank you, Crais.

43:39.284 --> 43:43.118
If you hadn't of returned,
we all would be dead.

43:46.875 --> 43:48.866
Your attack saved us.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.825
I had little control.

43:50.921 --> 43:54.254
Talyn came to free
Moya himself.

43:54.341 --> 43:55.751
You didn't command him?

43:55.842 --> 43:57.503
No. He acted alone.

43:57.594 --> 43:59.801
As much as any of us may want,

43:59.888 --> 44:04.177
he has the instincts of a
warrior and does exactly
as he pleases.

44:11.191 --> 44:12.727
How is Crichton?

44:12.818 --> 44:17.312
(softly singing):
Daisy, Daisy...

44:17.405 --> 44:18.815
John...

44:18.907 --> 44:21.523
I've brought my son Jothee
-Give me your answer true...

44:21.618 --> 44:25.406
to thank you.
-I'm half crazy...

44:25.497 --> 44:29.035
John?
-all for the love of you...

44:29.125 --> 44:31.741
Neural clone:
John,John,Johnun

44:31.837 --> 44:34.874
John, John, John...
-Shhh! He's here, um...

44:34.965 --> 44:38.924
He's here and, um...
he blames me.

44:39.010 --> 44:40.796
He blames me for killing
Scorpius.

44:40.887 --> 44:43.424
So, I've been... I've been
trying to... but I can't...

44:43.515 --> 44:45.927
Do what? Do what, John?

44:48.436 --> 44:51.348
D'Argo, kill me.

44:52.858 --> 44:54.394
D'Argo, please.

44:55.861 --> 44:57.476
Kill me.
