Nice ride.

It's a good way to see Beirut.

02:45.866 --> 02:49.869
This is very similar to that
place we went to years ago.

02:49.870 --> 02:57.870
This is your traditional
chicken sandwich.

02:58.379 --> 03:04.584
The roasted chicken was this
man's idea, Ramsey Short who I

03:04.585 --> 03:07.254
met in the bad old days of 2006.

03:07.255 --> 03:12.559
Apparently he's in with the
Lebanese chapter of the Harley

03:12.560 --> 03:15.262
Davidson group,
or hog for short.

03:15.263 --> 03:19.999
So when you roll into some
religiously conservative

03:20.000 --> 03:23.570
villages on the bikes and
leather jackets what is the

03:23.571 --> 03:23.837
reaction?

03:23.838 --> 03:25.805
Two types.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.574
Once we were pelted with rice

03:27.575 --> 03:29.642
and the other extreme was stones

03:29.643 --> 03:31.911
at the wheels like
just get out of here.

03:31.912 --> 03:36.316
I wouldn't throw stones
at people on Harleys.

03:36.317 --> 03:36.517
Whoa.

03:36.518 --> 03:37.417
Look at this.

03:37.418 --> 03:43.089
Let's dig in.

03:43.090 --> 03:46.426
This is a famous neighborhood.

03:46.427 --> 03:49.496
This area was central
during the civil war.

03:49.497 --> 03:53.833
The sheer volume of fire that
was poured into some of these

03:53.834 --> 03:56.636
buildings is absolutely
unbelievable.

03:56.637 --> 04:01.040
So many have been in the same
place over and over and over

04:01.041 --> 04:01.275
again.

04:01.276 --> 04:02.041
Clearly.

04:02.042 --> 04:06.012
I notice this every time
someone visiting the city they

04:06.013 --> 04:07.314
just point at that.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.381
Look at that.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.817
But you know, we don't
see them any many.

04:10.818 --> 04:18.817
Just pass by them.

04:20.394 --> 04:27.667
Beirut, seemingly the
world in literature.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.637
18 religious sects recognized.

04:30.638 --> 04:34.407
More than 2 million Christians,
over a million and a half

04:34.408 --> 04:39.979
Shiites, a million and a half
Sunni and 500,000 Palestinians

04:39.980 --> 04:46.319
and now as many as 2 million
Syrians, all living and somehow

04:46.320 --> 04:48.688
getting along, kind of, in a

04:48.689 --> 04:53.159
country the size of Connecticut.

04:53.160 --> 04:59.065
But along its borders the
country has what you might call

04:59.066 --> 05:00.833
serious neighbor issues.

05:00.834 --> 05:05.338
Isis in Syria threatening
to expand into Lebanon.

05:05.339 --> 05:09.942
Isis in many ways is something
we have never really

05:09.943 --> 05:12.712
seen before.

05:12.713 --> 05:17.283
A really large well organized
well equipped terrorist army.

05:17.284 --> 05:20.553
The country simply
can't take any more.

05:20.554 --> 05:25.525
A quarter of Lebanon's
population is now Syrian.

05:25.526 --> 05:31.698
That is the equivalent of the U.S.
taking in 83 million

05:31.699 --> 05:31.965
Syrians.

05:31.966 --> 05:36.736
The real fear is that
violence cross the border now

05:36.737 --> 05:44.477
spilling into an
already fragile area.

It is an incongruous mix.

the beginning.

07:30.484 --> 07:34.887
This neighborhood has long
been the home to principally

become an area for Syrians

07:42.229 --> 07:43.830

shelling and outright massacres

conflict known as the Lebanese

07:52.506 --> 07:53.439
civil war.

07:53.440 --> 07:57.276
Everywhere you see posters
representing factions and

affiliations from Asad loyalists

08:00.113 --> 08:02.515
to every flavor of extremist.

08:02.516 --> 08:06.553

Do you know of any other place

08:10.524 --> 08:14.026
these groups are co-existing
within a confined space?

08:14.027 --> 08:20.199
It is stunning to be walking
down the street behind short

08:20.200 --> 08:25.538
skirts and red wine flowing
and drive straight into an

08:25.539 --> 08:28.474
extraordinarily conservative
Shiite district.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.409
It is kind of mind blowing.

08:30.410 --> 08:34.780
I am not a gee owe political

08:34.782 --> 08:36.816

have been of each other.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.400
What do we call
this neighborhood?

08:54.401 --> 08:58.437
It's one of the mixed
areas that Beirut has.

08:58.438 --> 09:01.173
Close to 2 million
people from Syria alone.

09:01.174 --> 09:01.642
Yeah.

09:01.643 --> 09:06.613
That's a hell of a lot to be
absorbed by a tiny little

09:06.614 --> 09:06.847
nation.

09:06.848 --> 09:09.849
It's just loads of people
with nowhere to go.

09:09.850 --> 09:17.089
You see it in how cell phones
don't sometimes work the way

09:17.090 --> 09:17.790
they should.

09:17.791 --> 09:25.791
Bad infrastructure and more.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.200
We'll follow you.

09:28.201 --> 09:33.439

09:33.440 --> 09:36.943
The name is there.

09:36.944 --> 09:42.281
In Syria, he was an
English teacher.

09:42.282 --> 09:45.618
Needles to say he had at one
time a better life back there.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.286
I came from Syria.

09:47.287 --> 09:50.389
After the civil war
started... yeah.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.158
Many, many problems.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.626
Sectarian problems and we don't

09:53.627 --> 09:57.163
want to add more problems
for those people.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.799
But what can we do?

09:59.800 --> 10:00.900
We live here.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.469
Imagine the situation here.

10:03.470 --> 10:11.470
It is unbelievable.

10:15.816 --> 10:21.688
He is there by the way
and he has three kids.

10:21.689 --> 10:27.059
He works construction.

10:27.060 --> 10:35.060
His family bought this to
protect from the rats.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.772
These children need medical
operation but this family can't

10:39.773 --> 10:42.041
pay for those operation.

10:42.042 --> 10:46.545
It is expensive.

10:46.546 --> 10:47.747
They wait for nothing.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.549
They wait for the hand of god.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.251
Straining under the weight of

10:52.252 --> 10:56.455
all of these unasked for guests
the Lebanese government has

10:56.456 --> 10:59.025
begun making it very
difficult for them.

10:59.026 --> 11:02.228
He doesn't work because he
doesn't have an official

11:02.229 --> 11:05.264
resident so he can't
leave the camp.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.066
Otherwise he will be homeless.

11:07.067 --> 11:11.137
Being stopped at any of the
military check points could mean

11:11.138 --> 11:13.873
a one way ticket back to Syria,

11:13.874 --> 11:20.146
trapped, unable to work, they
exist invisibly on the margins

11:20.147 --> 11:21.313
of society.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.415
This is military.

11:23.416 --> 11:31.416
You don't want to get
involved in any problem.

11:32.592 --> 11:38.130
Syrian food, it is
called the seven countries.

11:38.131 --> 11:42.301
It consists of many
kinds of vegetables.

11:42.302 --> 11:50.276
Seven kinds of fruit.

11:50.277 --> 11:56.115
Most of them are doctors,
engineers, lawyers, teachers.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.917
Here now it's the opposite.

11:57.918 --> 12:05.257
Here in Lebanon even if you
were a doctor or a lawyer or a

12:05.258 --> 12:08.027
teacher, you can't
work only in the camp.

12:08.028 --> 12:13.265
We don't know how to go, where
to go, to go back to Syria.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.000
No can do.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.601
To cross the sea.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.003
Yeah.

12:17.004 --> 12:21.507
Suppose that there is authority
to collect us to throw

12:21.508 --> 12:24.610
us away to Syria,
what will we do?

12:24.611 --> 12:27.379
We have no area in the world.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.049
We have no place
in this universe.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.618
We belong to nowhere.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.588
Nowhere.

13:00.747 --> 13:06.152
Once known as the Paris of the
middle east, Beirut still

13:06.153 --> 13:10.923
clings to its glamorous 1960s
image where you could famously

13:10.924 --> 13:17.029
ski and go to the beach
all in the same day.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.398
Walking it's easy to forget, for

13:19.399 --> 13:27.399
a moment anyway, what's
going on not far from here.

13:57.637 --> 14:02.274
All the people who
live here feel safe.

14:02.275 --> 14:06.913
They expand outside of their
houses and this is one of their

14:06.914 --> 14:07.214
traditions.

14:07.215 --> 14:09.215
This is how I live my life.

14:09.216 --> 14:12.952
Mo is a local security
specialist on assignment to

14:12.953 --> 14:15.654

14:15.655 --> 14:19.558
He lives with his daughter and
family in Beirut, a mixed

14:19.559 --> 14:23.829
neighborhood of Christians,
Muslims and Jews were a little

14:23.830 --> 14:24.630

14:24.631 --> 14:24.898
Yes.

14:24.899 --> 14:25.443
So good.

14:33.240 --> 14:39.811
Very good fish.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.247
I missed this country.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.248
I really did.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.083
You have been here before?

14:44.084 --> 14:46.585
This is my third time.

14:46.586 --> 14:47.920
My first time was 2006.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.122
We came here and had two perfect

14:50.123 --> 14:51.958
days and then the war broke out.

14:51.959 --> 14:56.662
During my first trip here in

14:56.663 --> 15:04.170
2006, Hezbollah had a 44 day war

15:04.171 --> 15:08.340
that followed and much of Beirut

15:08.341 --> 15:14.280
was heavily pounded by bombs
and artilleries.

15:14.281 --> 15:17.283
You have this really
extraordinary mix of religions

15:17.284 --> 15:18.284
and people.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.451
What's so special?

15:19.452 --> 15:19.952
Why?

15:19.953 --> 15:24.490
Of course, somebody on Friday
going pray, somebody on Sunday

15:24.491 --> 15:26.792
going pray.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.327
They go the same restaurant and

15:28.328 --> 15:31.297
have the same food and they
have the same traditions.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.732
There is no place
better than Lebanon.

15:33.733 --> 15:34.533
You have everything.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.402
People are friendly.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.003
Beautiful, fantastic.

15:37.004 --> 15:39.638
It is a democracy here.

15:39.639 --> 15:40.239
Of course.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.642
You have choice to sit down.

15:43.643 --> 15:44.810
I like this.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.712
I don't like this.

15:46.713 --> 15:51.250
So what's it look like now?

15:51.251 --> 15:55.921
We looked like before 2006.

15:55.922 --> 15:58.324
That's not good.

15:58.325 --> 16:02.494
Tension is a little bit high
but the people, we are very

16:02.495 --> 16:02.762
happy.

16:02.763 --> 16:04.496
I go with my family.

16:04.497 --> 16:09.335
I was watching the news last
night in the hotel and it is

Not really.

16:28.755 --> 16:29.288

CNN has become the most

Same way a broken clock

It's in our core to be poetic.

Were you here at that time?

Yes.

Why this neighborhood?

Because the people of this

Hezbollah means
the party of god.

23:23.102 --> 23:28.707
They are a Shia military
political organization lavishly

23:28.708 --> 23:29.608
supported by Iran.

23:29.609 --> 23:32.110
The party is more powerful, more

I don't know when the
third one will be.

in your life?

31:32.992 --> 31:34.625

31:39.798 --> 31:43.534
under control of the extreme
right wing militia.

31:43.535 --> 31:49.440
I ended up in a torture room.

31:49.441 --> 31:54.612
Later after joining and then
leaving the Lebanese army,

31:54.613 --> 31:59.317
Michelle formed the NRU, an
armed revolutionary group.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.686
Your life now is
music and culture?

32:01.687 --> 32:05.623
I think that I was made to
be a musician but when war

32:05.624 --> 32:07.125
happened, I took a gun.

32:07.126 --> 32:12.230
I understood that I could not
face someone who was attacking

32:12.231 --> 32:16.201
my house with a guitar.

32:16.202 --> 32:21.206
In 2003, by now a music
producer, entrepreneur,

32:21.207 --> 32:25.476

maker, he founded the Beirut

32:25.477 --> 32:29.147

theater empty since the civil

32:29.148 --> 32:29.381
war.

32:29.382 --> 32:30.848
This is his kingdom.

32:30.849 --> 32:33.684
Some people come
because it's trendy.

32:33.685 --> 32:36.221
They come with sexy ladies.

32:36.222 --> 32:41.059
Some come because they like
to discover new things.

32:41.060 --> 32:44.595
We have up to 15 acts, each act

32:44.596 --> 32:46.231
coming from a different culture.

32:46.232 --> 32:48.266
Who needs culture?

32:48.267 --> 32:56.267
I think that culture
can save the world.

32:56.375 --> 33:00.211
Someone who had looks, someone
to listen to beautiful music

33:00.212 --> 33:02.680
cannot become an animal again.

33:02.681 --> 33:07.385
If you were the emperor of
the world, hypothetically.

33:07.386 --> 33:07.918
Hopefully.

33:07.919 --> 33:11.422
Hopefully, what would Beirut
be like in ten years?

33:11.423 --> 33:18.029
Best case scenario it goes
back to before the creation of

33:18.030 --> 33:18.297

33:18.298 --> 33:20.631
When all communities were
living together well.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.867
We would have a Jewish
neighborhood here.

33:22.868 --> 33:27.605
I think we would have to be
united to fight the monster,

33:27.606 --> 33:28.206
Isis.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.741
Once the monster is defeated you

33:30.742 --> 33:33.712
can start arguing again
about other things.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.176
How you doing?

34:38.177 --> 34:39.110
I'm Tony?

34:39.110 --> 34:41.379

34:41.380 --> 34:41.780
Yes.

34:41.781 --> 34:44.114
But it's not so please relax.

34:44.116 --> 34:45.616
I am relaxed.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.152
Can I get my beer.

34:47.152 --> 34:50.855
By all means, yes please.

34:50.856 --> 34:53.123
Lots of people come here.

34:53.125 --> 34:57.895
They are mostly musicians
and sick people.

Lots of jamming here and it's

34:59.465 --> 35:01.799

35:12.211 --> 35:14.312
Syrian and acutely aware of the

35:14.313 --> 35:17.348
tricky political realities
with which they must live.

35:17.349 --> 35:19.484
They were concerned about us filming

35:19.485 --> 35:21.819
here and wanted us to understand

35:21.820 --> 35:25.423
clearly that the cafe has no
political affiliation and that

35:25.424 --> 35:27.258
the opinions of this young lady

35:27.259 --> 35:32.163
are not that of the cafe or
even that of the clientele.

35:32.164 --> 35:34.499
You are born and bred sue knee?

35:34.500 --> 35:35.433
Yes.

35:35.434 --> 35:39.504
I was born and brought
up in Syria, Damascus.

35:39.505 --> 35:42.940
The army entered our house and
I found them in our bedroom

35:42.941 --> 35:48.679
looking for the free
Syrian army.

35:48.680 --> 35:52.950
My dad knew he couldn't protect
us because he was old.

35:52.951 --> 35:59.023
Three hours later we decided to
leave, so we came to Beirut.

35:59.024 --> 36:00.391
We always eat here.

36:00.392 --> 36:08.392
Grape leaves are my and I
have four months left and

36:17.476 --> 36:18.075
I have no idea what to do.

36:18.076 --> 36:22.079
What do you think, will
they renew your visa?

36:22.080 --> 36:25.049
So far, I don't think so.

36:25.050 --> 36:28.719
And do they the arrest you?

36:28.720 --> 36:29.387
Do they take you to the border

36:29.388 --> 36:30.221
and kick you over
to the other side?

36:30.222 --> 36:30.888
They send you back to Syria.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.757
What happens if you
go back to Syria?

36:32.758 --> 36:34.792
Most probably die.

36:34.793 --> 36:42.233
On the way or to some people get
arrested or be taken to the

36:42.234 --> 36:42.434
army.

36:42.435 --> 36:43.601
How different is
Damascus from Beirut?

36:43.602 --> 36:49.407
Oh, it is really, really
different, and in Damascus, I

36:49.408 --> 36:51.108
was always afraid of the
government, and some people died

36:51.109 --> 36:53.010
because they cursed
the president.

36:53.011 --> 36:59.183
I left Syria, and I found hope
here, and I screamed in the

36:59.184 --> 37:02.487
streets cursing all of the
politicians, and everything.

37:02.488 --> 37:09.126
It is all right, nobody is
going to come to arrest you.

37:09.127 --> 37:10.127
I really love this place
with all of my heart.

37:10.128 --> 37:16.133
Is all of the chaos and the
violence worth it for change?

37:16.134 --> 37:16.767
It is is worth dying for?

37:16.768 --> 37:23.040
I mean, things were, there was
order when you grew up, there

37:23.041 --> 37:23.309
was order?

37:23.309 --> 37:23.609
Yes.

37:23.610 --> 37:24.442
No freedom, but order.

37:24.443 --> 37:27.378
Would you go back to that?

37:27.379 --> 37:32.950
I don't think that there's
anything worthy in the world of

37:32.951 --> 37:34.519
a human blood.

37:34.520 --> 37:38.389
There is nothing more
important than human being.

37:38.390 --> 37:40.958
You have never been able to
yell out loud, and you have

37:40.959 --> 37:43.027
never been able to do the things

37:43.028 --> 37:45.630
that you could do right
now, you would go back?

37:45.631 --> 37:46.230
I was alive.

37:46.231 --> 37:48.666
A lot of people were alive, too.

37:48.667 --> 37:51.637
♪

38:14.192 --> 38:20.731
During the day, widespread
shocking bombing and widespread

38:20.732 --> 38:21.166
finger pointing.

38:21.167 --> 38:26.237
This has set off a tide of
unrest and civil unrest.

38:41.186 --> 38:49.186
For capitalists like
myself and Ramsey.

38:53.298 --> 38:57.034
It is a communist-themed bar.

38:57.035 --> 39:00.538
What is this?

39:00.539 --> 39:02.540
I don't know, it is
put in front of us.

39:02.541 --> 39:08.713
Well, we should drink it and
not try to figure it out.

39:08.714 --> 39:09.313
Oh, with well.

39:09.314 --> 39:10.247
Vodka.

39:10.248 --> 39:11.582
Vodka.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.217
I had somebody who lives here

39:13.218 --> 39:17.722
tell me, oh, this place is very

39:17.723 --> 39:18.355
good, and stay the here longer.

39:18.356 --> 39:21.492
And I was like, what?

39:21.493 --> 39:22.126
You are trying to kill us, man.

39:22.127 --> 39:22.561
Who is this man?

39:22.562 --> 39:23.293
Yeah, yeah.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.295
He is trying to hurt us.

39:25.296 --> 39:29.133
Cheers.

39:29.134 --> 39:35.272
And after a more than a few
indigenous beverages, and now we

39:35.273 --> 39:35.607
are talking.

39:35.607 --> 39:35.907
Cheers.

39:35.908 --> 39:37.642
Enter Ernesto.

39:37.643 --> 39:41.779
Hey, hey.

39:41.780 --> 39:42.413
I have something for you.

39:42.414 --> 39:42.781
Yeah, yeah.

39:42.781 --> 39:43.281
It is a Cuban cigar.

39:43.282 --> 39:51.282
And in the words of Vladimir
Illitch Lennon, let's get this

39:57.028 --> 39:57.429
party started.

39:57.430 --> 39:59.997
My mom, she made some cheese,

39:59.998 --> 40:03.768
and it is the kind of
the rotten cheese.

40:03.769 --> 40:04.002
Oh.

40:04.003 --> 40:08.272
I called my dad and I said, there
is a dad called Tony, CNN,

40:08.273 --> 40:13.444
and he said, I don't watch CNN
and I said, but he is a cool

40:13.445 --> 40:13.612
guy.

40:13.613 --> 40:21.613
He wants to make the
best food for you.

40:22.387 --> 40:23.287
This is someone that
I know in Beirut.

40:23.288 --> 40:23.821
It is lamb and spices.

40:23.822 --> 40:24.122
Oh, man.

40:24.123 --> 40:28.694
That is good.

40:29.294 --> 40:31.128
Are we picking up a gun or not?

40:31.129 --> 40:34.364
They will fight these people.

40:34.365 --> 40:38.402
Oh, no, we have to have it.

40:38.403 --> 40:42.907
I seem to remember mom at
some point pulling out a some

40:42.908 --> 40:43.974
kind of automatic weapon.

40:43.975 --> 40:46.977
I will take it up in
arms, and I will fight.

40:46.978 --> 40:51.081
Let me tell you about it.

40:51.082 --> 40:59.082
And then Bootsy Collins came
over the intercom system, and

41:04.162 --> 41:07.865
the rest dissolved into a fog.

41:07.866 --> 41:09.767
It is am amazing
that it persists.

41:09.768 --> 41:14.004
And I have been a number of

41:14.005 --> 41:15.172
places, and this the place,
it is the world's finest.

41:15.173 --> 41:16.907
I think so, too.

41:16.908 --> 41:24.908
Here is to Tony, man.

41:33.191 --> 41:37.695
Beirut... everybody
should come here.

41:37.696 --> 41:39.196
Everybody should see how
complicated and deeply trouble

41:39.197 --> 41:41.966
and yet at the same time how
beautiful and awesome the world

41:41.967 --> 41:42.867
can be.

41:42.868 --> 41:46.637
Everyone should experience even

41:46.638 --> 41:49.206
as the clouds gather what's
at stake, what could be lost,

41:49.207 --> 41:57.207
what's still here and
never let that hope go.

41:59.217 --> 42:02.788
Beirut, there is
no place like it.
