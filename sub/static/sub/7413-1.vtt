00:54.375 --> 00:57.914
Norway 1363.
It's been ten years ago since...

00:58.292 --> 01:02.286
...the Black Death killed almost
a half of the population.

01:02.667 --> 01:08.368
The country is deserted
and lawlessness prevails.

01:10.333 --> 01:16.455
Some defy danger and go away
to find a better life.

02:34.166 --> 02:35.874
Good.

02:36.250 --> 02:39.582
Signe?
Do you want to try?

02:41.458 --> 02:44.040
Do you have a view on the...

02:46.208 --> 02:48.124
Aim along the arrow.

02:48.500 --> 02:52.124
- Nice. You are just a bit...
- Impatient.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.124
Food is ready!

03:56.250 --> 03:57.749
Tormod?

04:00.333 --> 04:02.249
Look at this

04:15.833 --> 04:19.457
- What's going on?
- Some stones...

04:31.875 --> 04:33.749
Stay here!

04:43.458 --> 04:45.415
No, do not look!

05:04.166 --> 05:06.999
I'll take care of you.

05:29.750 --> 05:32.665
- Wasn't just two of them?
- Kids!

05:58.833 --> 06:00.165
Help!

06:13.416 --> 06:15.665
Run! Run, Tormod!

06:16.541 --> 06:18.499
- Boy!
- I got him.

06:23.416 --> 06:24.832
NO!

07:15.583 --> 07:18.457
You got her father.
She's mine.

07:32.666 --> 07:34.124
Wait.

08:06.666 --> 08:09.082
Take her.

08:13.375 --> 08:15.415
Something to warm up with.

09:57.916 --> 09:59.665
Careful.

10:59.083 --> 11:00.832
Frigg?

11:01.500 --> 11:03.165
Hello!

11:03.750 --> 11:06.165
- Have you been good?
- Yes.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.290
I have to ask.
Are you excited about what I brought you?

11:09.666 --> 11:11.749
Let's see.

11:12.291 --> 11:14.499
Why is she here?

11:39.125 --> 11:41.124
Here.

11:55.750 --> 11:58.374
Look at that! Nice?

11:59.958 --> 12:02.040
Now, you were lucky.

12:06.791 --> 12:08.665
You can have...

12:15.333 --> 12:18.415
The horse is yours.

12:19.916 --> 12:21.790
Frigg?

12:40.708 --> 12:47.665
What is your name?

12:53.208 --> 12:58.957
Do not be afraid of them.
They don't dare to touch you...

12:59.333 --> 13:01.999
...as long as I forbid them.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.207
I'm so thirsty.

14:18.541 --> 14:20.374
You're not like them.

14:20.750 --> 14:24.124
Frigg? What are you doing?

14:39.416 --> 14:44.082
Every time she tries something,
you cut off a finger.

14:46.125 --> 14:49.249
Enough of beating her.

15:07.416 --> 15:09.290
Good.

15:09.666 --> 15:11.832
You, come here.

15:12.208 --> 15:15.999
She deserved it, right?

15:18.250 --> 15:20.165
Come.

15:23.333 --> 15:25.582
Go to bed.

15:41.375 --> 15:46.707
I can not have children anymore, and
Frigg wants to have a sister.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.707
A little sister.

16:36.250 --> 16:38.540
There is one thing you must understand.

16:38.916 --> 16:41.124
Frigg means everything to us.

16:41.500 --> 16:45.749
Shit Kid and the Witch
can burn in hell!

17:12.083 --> 17:15.499
Do not feel sorry for her.

17:15.875 --> 17:18.374
Frigg, look at me.

17:18.750 --> 17:20.540
She wants us evil.

17:20.915 --> 17:26.249
There are people, people like her,
who chased us out of the forest.

17:27.625 --> 17:31.124
- Do not talk to her.
- I'm not a child anymore, Dagmar.

17:34.125 --> 17:37.707
You know that you can tell mom, right?

18:31.291 --> 18:34.790
Quiet, or I cut your throat.

18:39.125 --> 18:40.915
Not a sound!

19:05.708 --> 19:08.624
I was the one who found her.

19:19.083 --> 19:21.999
- Dagmar said no.
- We do everything for her.

19:22.375 --> 19:25.040
She is our reward.

19:41.750 --> 19:44.124
You must remember one thing...

20:06.000 --> 20:08.749
Do you hear what I said?
Do you hear what I said?

20:14.750 --> 20:17.207
- Dagmar?
- Wait a minute.

20:24.166 --> 20:25.999
It is enough.

20:29.916 --> 20:32.499
That's enough, I said!

20:39.250 --> 20:42.749
You're getting old, Arvid.

20:43.125 --> 20:46.415
I have said that it is enough.
Are you deaf?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.707
You...

21:17.166 --> 21:19.832
What did I say about this?

21:20.750 --> 21:22.290
Witch!

21:27.375 --> 21:30.749
I missed your little brother's heart.

21:31.125 --> 21:33.040
He has probably spent hours
to bleed to death.

21:33.416 --> 21:37.749
Maybe he is still screaming for help!

21:40.958 --> 21:43.124
I just can not wait until tomorrow.

21:43.500 --> 21:47.707
I'll send the boys on you,
one by one.

22:03.625 --> 22:06.582
That's what I would say.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.624
You know what you have to do
when the sun rises in the morning?

22:16.000 --> 22:20.082
- Say it.
- I'll cut off her finger.

22:23.041 --> 22:25.415
Yes. Good.

24:36.583 --> 24:38.499
Go.

24:47.208 --> 24:49.124
- Stop!
- Come!

24:49.500 --> 24:50.874
Arvid!

24:55.416 --> 24:57.249
She runs away!

24:59.250 --> 25:02.582
Frigg? Frigg!

25:05.166 --> 25:06.957
Come on!

25:40.625 --> 25:41.915
Come.

25:44.125 --> 25:46.290
They are not here!

25:47.833 --> 25:49.540
- Frigg!
- Frigg!

25:50.625 --> 25:54.624
- We ran past them.
- Search through the forest.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.457
Find them.

27:36.416 --> 27:37.624
Here!

27:38.708 --> 27:40.540
At the ravine!

28:04.750 --> 28:06.582
Help me!

28:32.833 --> 28:35.374
- I got her.
- Wait!

28:38.125 --> 28:41.582
Frigg, stay there! I'll get you.

28:46.250 --> 28:47.957
Frigg?

28:59.666 --> 29:03.374
We cross further down.

29:03.750 --> 29:05.457
Come.

29:26.041 --> 29:29.915
They're going to catch us.
We must get away from the trail.

29:30.291 --> 29:31.999
Come.

29:58.791 --> 30:03.290
- We spread ourselves. Then we meet here.
- What do we do with them?

30:03.666 --> 30:05.874
Bring Frigg here.

30:06.250 --> 30:09.332
And the other girl?

30:09.708 --> 30:12.290
Do whatever you want to.

30:14.583 --> 30:17.332
We find a different one.

31:01.375 --> 31:05.415
You still have not said thanks for that
l helped you to set free.

31:07.083 --> 31:09.332
I do not know how to survive here.

31:09.708 --> 31:14.582
If you want to live, you better turn around.
They can take much better care of you.

31:14.958 --> 31:18.374
I can take care of myself.

32:01.125 --> 32:05.290
The girl has probably threatened Frigg
to follow.

32:08.041 --> 32:11.832
We'll just find her
and take her home.

32:50.916 --> 32:53.332
Where is Loki?

33:10.208 --> 33:12.249
Take my hand.

33:16.375 --> 33:18.124
That's it.

33:23.291 --> 33:25.249
Hurry!

33:59.458 --> 34:01.165
Come!

35:07.000 --> 35:09.124
Calm down.

35:10.583 --> 35:13.082
You'll me mine anyway.

35:16.708 --> 35:18.499
It will be fine.

35:28.416 --> 35:30.165
Hello! Get out!

35:31.541 --> 35:34.499
Otherwise ... I cut your throat.

36:38.208 --> 36:39.999
Let's see.

37:44.083 --> 37:47.790
I should have killed her in the ravine.

38:14.958 --> 38:17.249
They can be anywhere.

38:17.625 --> 38:21.249
Want to see Frigg again?

38:22.041 --> 38:25.457
I just want Frigg to be all right.

38:34.041 --> 38:36.457
You have personally been on the run.

38:37.958 --> 38:40.540
What would you do?

38:43.625 --> 38:46.457
I would have followed the valley.

38:46.833 --> 38:48.749
Along the river.

38:49.416 --> 38:52.249
And try to find people.

38:57.791 --> 39:00.374
What if there's someone there.

40:30.250 --> 40:32.957
Only dead people.

40:35.458 --> 40:37.207
Yes.

40:49.458 --> 40:52.374
Where are your parents?

40:55.916 --> 40:58.499
The  real one

41:12.541 --> 41:14.749
Dagmar told me...

41:15.125 --> 41:17.582
... I was alone when they found me.

41:17.958 --> 41:21.582
The Black Death had taken the mother and father.

41:21.958 --> 41:25.749
Only I survived on the farm.

41:28.708 --> 41:32.249
Do you remember anything?

43:07.958 --> 43:10.207
You said you'd take care of me.

44:59.250 --> 45:01.374
What are you doing here?

45:02.458 --> 45:03.915
Answer!

45:04.291 --> 45:06.457
We wanted to warm up.
We leave now.

45:06.833 --> 45:08.665
Stop!

45:14.083 --> 45:18.040
You can never be too careful
up here.

45:21.416 --> 45:26.749
I saw the smoke from the house ...
I thought it was robbers.

45:29.666 --> 45:32.249
Are you hungry?

45:39.041 --> 45:41.165
We went down into the valley.

45:42.583 --> 45:44.790
Then we found the farm ...

45:45.750 --> 45:49.499
And decided to rest here until tomorrow.

45:51.125 --> 45:54.082
I'm sorry to hear about your family.

45:56.333 --> 45:58.665
How many men were there?

45:59.041 --> 46:00.832
Five men.

46:02.250 --> 46:05.499
But woman was their leader.

46:05.875 --> 46:07.624
Dagmar.

46:08.125 --> 46:10.374
Dagmar?

46:12.000 --> 46:16.249
- Do you know who she is?
- Everyone around here knows her.

46:18.708 --> 46:21.582
<i> When Black Death came to the valley... </i>

46:21.958 --> 46:25.165
<i> ...people thought it was Dagmar's making. </i>

46:25.541 --> 46:29.457
They thought Dagmar had tossed
a curse on the village.

46:41.125 --> 46:46.165
<i> She and her daughter were
 subjected to the water test. </i>

47:04.833 --> 47:07.082
- She had a child?
- Yes.

47:07.458 --> 47:09.540
Five years old.

47:11.208 --> 47:16.040
<i> You could say that
 they took it away from her. </i>

47:18.291 --> 47:23.040
<i> After the girl had drowned
 it was her turn. </i>

47:32.333 --> 47:36.290
But when they would pull up, the body was gone.

47:36.666 --> 47:41.124
<i> They were looking at the bottom of the river,
 but found nothing. </i>

47:58.708 --> 48:00.290
What do you do?

48:00.666 --> 48:04.374
- Takes care of the weapon.
- What's it for?

48:04.750 --> 48:06.540
Bear.

48:07.750 --> 48:09.832
How?

48:10.208 --> 48:13.874
- It interest you?
- Yes.

48:15.583 --> 48:18.540
First, you get the bear
to run after you...

48:18.916 --> 48:21.374
Then you lie down and wait.

48:21.750 --> 48:25.165
Let him come very close...

48:25.541 --> 48:29.207
And bring up the spear,
aiming at its chest, and...

48:53.625 --> 48:59.082
Signe?

49:04.416 --> 49:07.790
There is a village two days from here.

49:08.166 --> 49:11.999
- I have to bury my brother.
- It is not safe now.

49:12.375 --> 49:16.207
I'll find someone in the village
that follow you there

49:17.916 --> 49:20.249
Do you know someone
who can take care of Frigg?

49:20.625 --> 49:22.290
Yes.

49:22.666 --> 49:24.374
You.

49:24.750 --> 49:26.582
Me? No.

49:27.208 --> 49:29.665
I can barely take care of myself.

49:30.041 --> 49:32.915
You got her away from them.

49:33.291 --> 49:36.999
Maybe you can do more than you think?

49:45.333 --> 49:47.040
Frigg?

49:48.583 --> 49:51.707
Frigg, where are you?

49:52.666 --> 49:53.999
Frigg!

49:56.750 --> 49:58.624
Frigg...

49:59.500 --> 50:01.665
What is it?

50:05.041 --> 50:08.499
Did you think we had left you?

50:20.083 --> 50:21.874
No.

50:32.583 --> 50:34.290
Who is he?

50:34.666 --> 50:36.665
Does not matter.

50:37.041 --> 50:41.957
We kill him and the girl.
Frigg gets her punishment in the camp..

50:42.958 --> 50:44.707
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

50:45.083 --> 50:46.624
Ready.

50:51.333 --> 50:53.040
Yes, I'm ready.

51:04.458 --> 51:06.249
Watch!

52:28.791 --> 52:31.707
Stop! Back!

52:36.625 --> 52:38.665
Drop the knife!

52:42.958 --> 52:46.332
Get all back in the yard.
Get them out!

52:46.708 --> 52:47.874
All back in the yard.

52:48.250 --> 52:50.332
- Now!
- Come out!

53:00.708 --> 53:03.707
- Get ready to run.
- Let him go!

53:17.791 --> 53:21.665
- Let Frigg go, and we 'll leave.
- Put down your weapons.

53:22.041 --> 53:24.165
Frigg?

53:24.958 --> 53:28.915
Come out, or I will kill you!

53:49.625 --> 53:50.874
Come!

54:22.250 --> 54:26.249
I know the injustice that was done
towards you and the child...

54:26.625 --> 54:28.957
But these girls are innocent.

54:29.333 --> 54:32.665
Just as you and your was.

54:40.500 --> 54:42.207
Dagmar ...

54:43.041 --> 54:45.332
We let go Frigg.

54:47.458 --> 54:49.957
We let go Frigg.

55:03.958 --> 55:05.374
NO!

55:30.125 --> 55:32.249
Out the back door! Hurry up.

55:32.625 --> 55:35.249
- We're not leaving without you.
- Do it now!

56:50.625 --> 56:51.832
Come!

57:09.625 --> 57:11.124
Around the house!

58:12.458 --> 58:14.582
Come, Frigg.

58:17.291 --> 58:19.415
- I jump!
- No ...

58:47.708 --> 58:51.790
I know I've done so many ...

58:52.541 --> 58:54.707
...terrible things.

58:56.250 --> 58:59.457
But I promise to change.

59:01.666 --> 59:04.499
Everything should be fine now.

59:04.875 --> 59:08.915
We start all over again,
just me and you.

59:13.458 --> 59:16.957
- Will you let Signe to go?
- Course.

59:26.625 --> 59:29.874
Never forget who you are, Frigg.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.749
NO!

01:01:34.083 --> 01:01:36.415
What carve you?

01:07:06.208 --> 01:07:07.957
Here.

01:08:28.666 --> 01:08:30.415
Along the arrow.

01:11:18.333 --> 01:11:22.082
- You have been in the river before.
- You too.

01:11:30.666 --> 01:11:32.290
Die!

01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:53.290
Mom!
