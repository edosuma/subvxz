00:25.780 --> 00:28.442
On his 35th birthday,

00:28.516 --> 00:31.713
l decided to tell Julius Benedict...

00:31.786 --> 00:34.721
the truth about himself.

00:38.526 --> 00:41.256
Julius already knew
that he was the product...

00:41.329 --> 00:43.763
of a scientific experiment...

00:43.831 --> 00:46.129
conducted by the American government.

00:48.469 --> 00:52.337
A top-secret experiment designed
to produce a physically,

00:52.406 --> 00:56.240
mentally and spiritually
advanced human being.

01:00.181 --> 01:02.911
He knew that,
unlike other little boys,

01:02.984 --> 01:06.818
he had not one, but six fathers--

01:06.887 --> 01:09.219
All very distinguished men...

01:09.290 --> 01:12.225
especially chosen for
their genetic excellence.

01:14.428 --> 01:16.362
And of course,

01:16.430 --> 01:19.627
he knew about Mary Ann Benedict,

01:22.069 --> 01:24.367
the remarkable young woman...

01:24.438 --> 01:27.271
who was selected to be his mother.

01:44.425 --> 01:48.122
Sadly, he had long lived
with the tragic knowledge...

01:48.195 --> 01:52.996
that his mother died
while giving birth to him.

01:56.904 --> 01:59.702
Now, what Julius did not know,

01:59.774 --> 02:02.709
not until this very moment,

02:02.777 --> 02:07.043
was that about a minute
after he was born...

02:07.114 --> 02:11.881
his mother gave birth
to another baby boy.

02:59.834 --> 03:02.359
l have a brother?

03:02.436 --> 03:04.666
Ya.

03:04.739 --> 03:07.333
He was sent to an orphanage
in Los Angeles...

03:07.408 --> 03:10.707
at the same time
l brought you here to the island.

03:12.646 --> 03:16.446
Julius had spent his entire life
here on the island,

03:16.517 --> 03:20.044
helping me with my research.

03:20.121 --> 03:23.488
l always thought he was happy,
and had no desire to leave.

03:23.557 --> 03:25.650
How wrong l was.

03:25.726 --> 03:28.820
l must find him.

03:31.432 --> 03:34.333
Julius, Julius!
Wait, wait.

03:36.303 --> 03:39.033
l couldn't believe he was going.

03:40.307 --> 03:44.175
He wasn't equipped to deal
with the outside world.

03:45.446 --> 03:48.745
All of his knowledge was from books.

03:49.917 --> 03:52.818
Julius could speak 12 languages.

03:52.887 --> 03:55.355
He excelled in history, science,

03:55.422 --> 03:58.016
mathematics, literature.

03:58.092 --> 04:00.925
He was pure in body and in spirit.

04:00.995 --> 04:02.087
Ahhh!

04:02.163 --> 04:05.155
But for the first time,

04:05.232 --> 04:07.427
Julius would not listen to me.

04:07.501 --> 04:11.028
He's probably just like me.

04:19.814 --> 04:24.717
The nearest island with
an airport was 27 miles away.

04:27.488 --> 04:30.787
But Julius did not care.

04:30.858 --> 04:33.486
He had become obsessed
with the idea...

04:33.561 --> 04:37.053
that his brother, Vincent,
was in some kind of trouble...

04:37.131 --> 04:40.430
and desperately needed his help.

04:44.305 --> 04:46.500
Honey, l'm home!

04:46.574 --> 04:48.769
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no.

04:48.843 --> 04:51.311
- Get going!
- l'm going.

05:15.669 --> 05:17.694
Oh, hello, hello!

05:17.771 --> 05:20.205
Oh, my goodness!

05:26.947 --> 05:29.472
Good-bye.

05:39.093 --> 05:42.085
- We're gonna be late for work.
- l need my horoscope.

05:42.162 --> 05:45.529
- Yeah, horoscope.
- ''Your judgment is at its peak today.

05:45.599 --> 05:48.762
Use it wisely,
and romance will follow.''

05:48.836 --> 05:52.431
- Ooh, good one.
- l hope so.

05:52.506 --> 05:54.701
Ladies!

05:54.775 --> 05:57.903
- Vince!
- l thought you broke up with him.

05:57.978 --> 05:59.946
l did, l did!

06:03.250 --> 06:07.619
- You don't mind if l talk
to your sister, do you?
- She doesn't mind.

06:07.688 --> 06:09.883
Don't give him any money.

06:09.957 --> 06:14.758
Uh, no, no, l promised Marnie
l wouldn't give you any money.

06:19.266 --> 06:21.996
Don't look at me like--

06:22.069 --> 06:24.867
Don't do that thing
with your eyes.

06:24.939 --> 06:28.534
l'm not even supposed
to be here with you.

06:28.609 --> 06:32.067
You are here,
and so am l.

06:32.146 --> 06:34.740
Maybe millions
of people go by,

06:34.815 --> 06:37.079
but they all
disappear from view.

06:37.151 --> 06:40.882
l only have eyes
for you, Linda.

06:40.955 --> 06:43.890
l only have
eyes for you.

06:45.592 --> 06:48.857
Mmm.

06:48.929 --> 06:52.956
- lt's the baby Klane!
- What?

06:55.536 --> 06:57.527
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:57.604 --> 07:00.129
- Can l help you?
- Uh, yeah.

07:00.207 --> 07:02.835
Where's the little shit?

07:02.910 --> 07:05.435
You'll have to be
more specific...

07:05.512 --> 07:07.946
concerning the clientele.

07:08.015 --> 07:10.006
Benedict.

07:10.084 --> 07:13.247
Oh, he wouldn't come in here.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.413
- lsn't that right, Marnie?
- Who, Vincent?

07:16.857 --> 07:20.759
That weasel? That creep?

07:20.828 --> 07:24.491
l wouldn't serve him if he crawled in
on his hands and knees.

07:27.301 --> 07:30.668
Take out the papers
and the trash

07:30.738 --> 07:34.265
Or you don't get
no spending cash

07:34.408 --> 07:37.002
lf you don't scrub
that kitchen floor

07:37.077 --> 07:41.514
You ain't gonna
rock and roll no more

07:41.582 --> 07:44.983
Yakety-yak
don't talk back

07:45.052 --> 07:48.681
l knew you were trouble
the second l laid eyes on you.

07:48.756 --> 07:53.318
Excuse me. l just have never
heard this kind of music before.

07:55.329 --> 07:57.991
Yakety-yak
don't talk back

07:58.065 --> 08:00.226
Take out the papers

08:00.300 --> 08:02.700
Take out the papers

08:02.770 --> 08:05.568
Take... out...
the... papers

08:05.639 --> 08:09.200
Take out the papers
Take out the papers

08:10.644 --> 08:13.044
Take... out...
the... papers

08:13.113 --> 08:15.604
And the trash
Trash

08:24.892 --> 08:27.326
La-la-la
La-la-la

08:29.930 --> 08:32.524

Hey, Vince!

09:46.173 --> 09:48.232
Listen, Al,

09:48.308 --> 09:50.435
you gotta help me out.

09:50.477 --> 09:53.037
l'm into the Klane
brothers for $20,000.

09:53.113 --> 09:56.378
- You borrowed money from a loan shark?
- What do you got?

09:56.450 --> 09:59.749
Got anything for me?
See what you got.

09:59.820 --> 10:02.311
We're doing this
too often, Vince.

10:02.389 --> 10:04.516
l'll give you something.

10:04.591 --> 10:07.754
l got a nice BMW
up on 4, stall 20.

10:42.896 --> 10:45.888
Vince, l'll take all
of these you can get.

10:45.966 --> 10:48.764
All right, Tony.

10:48.835 --> 10:51.235
- For you.
- Thanks, Tony.

10:51.305 --> 10:53.239
Yeah.

10:53.307 --> 10:55.241
Whoa, Tony!

10:55.309 --> 10:59.803
There's only $4000 here.
For a car like this is $6000.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.542
We're in a recession.
Everything's tough.

11:02.616 --> 11:05.380
You wanna try someone else,
no hard feelings.

11:05.452 --> 11:07.716
No, l just could've
used some more.

11:07.788 --> 11:10.416
- You okay, Vince? You seem worried.
- Yeah.

11:10.490 --> 11:12.856
Your bowels troubling you?

11:22.369 --> 11:24.997
What an amazing country.

11:25.973 --> 11:27.838
Hey.

11:27.908 --> 11:29.842
Gotta light, pal?

11:29.910 --> 11:33.903
Oh, excuse me.
l don't smoke, pal.

11:33.981 --> 11:36.040
Yeah. Ha-ha.

11:36.116 --> 11:39.017
Yeah, good stuff, huh?

11:39.086 --> 11:42.715
- Pickin' up something
for the girlfriend?
- l don't have a girlfriend.

11:42.789 --> 11:45.223
Do women really
wear those things?

11:45.292 --> 11:47.226
lf you're lucky, they do.

11:47.294 --> 11:49.228
l can't believe it.

11:49.296 --> 11:51.321
- You're from out of town?
- Yes.

11:51.398 --> 11:55.391
As a matter of fact, l come from
an island in the South Pacific.

11:55.469 --> 11:58.199
Whoa!

12:00.474 --> 12:03.068
What the hell did
you do to him, man!

12:03.143 --> 12:07.136
l did nothing.
The pavement was his enemy.

12:07.214 --> 12:11.150
Let me check him out.
A light concussion.

12:11.218 --> 12:12.947
Uh-oh.

12:13.020 --> 12:15.318
- l carry him to a hospital.
- No!

12:15.389 --> 12:17.721
l think you should
just take off, man.

12:17.791 --> 12:19.782
Find your horse
you came in on.

12:19.860 --> 12:21.760
l'm so sorry about this.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.854
- l feel terrible.
- Me, too. Thanks a lot.

12:24.931 --> 12:26.956
- Sorry.
- Yeah, l'm sorry.

12:27.034 --> 12:30.697
The next time you should
really consider wearing helmets.

12:30.771 --> 12:32.796
Yeah, have a nice day.

12:32.873 --> 12:36.070
You don't have to buy them.
Just don't say they're cheap!

12:36.143 --> 12:39.772
These are quality socks.

12:39.846 --> 12:43.282
What a day it's been.
Oh, no, no, no!

12:43.350 --> 12:45.511
Oh, oh! Jesus Christ!

12:45.585 --> 12:49.646
$53! Are you
out of your mind?

12:49.723 --> 12:53.159
Your vehicle is in a handicapped zone,
if you didn't notice.

12:53.226 --> 12:55.558
So, do l look
normal to you?

12:55.629 --> 12:57.859
You don't have a handicapped
sticker in your windshield.

12:57.931 --> 13:01.025
Oh, come on.
You don't need a sticker.

13:01.101 --> 13:03.092
Handicapped, my ass!

13:03.170 --> 13:05.968
l'll need your
driver's license, sir.

13:06.039 --> 13:08.633
Look, l'm sorry
l lost my temper.

13:08.709 --> 13:10.643
Driver's license,
please.

13:10.711 --> 13:13.612
- Look, l had a very bad day.
- Driver's license... please.

13:13.680 --> 13:17.377
You've got over 200 outstanding
parking tickets, Mr. Benedict.

13:17.451 --> 13:20.614
You just had your birthday.
Your driver's license expired.

13:20.687 --> 13:22.678
Happy birthday.
Watch your head.

13:22.756 --> 13:24.815
Thanks.

13:31.598 --> 13:33.623
Come along, now.

13:33.700 --> 13:36.224
So this is where
my brother grew up.

13:36.358 --> 13:39.953
l'm so happy he had so many
children to play with.

13:44.265 --> 13:46.733
And that's where
he must have slept!

13:47.569 --> 13:49.434
Yes, it was.

13:49.504 --> 13:51.495
How did you know?

13:51.573 --> 13:54.633
lt's the one l'd have chosen,
close to the fire extinguisher.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.643
ln case of a fire,

13:56.711 --> 14:00.112
l could have given the alarm
and saved all the other orphans.

14:01.416 --> 14:04.613
We've had only one fire
in here at St. Charlotte's.

14:04.686 --> 14:08.019
Vince Benedict started it,
we like to think by accident.

14:10.959 --> 14:14.053
Tell me a little bit
about Vincent.

14:14.129 --> 14:16.962
Was he a great athlete?
lnterested in chess and poetry?

14:17.032 --> 14:19.830
l'm certain God had a purpose
when he created Vince Benedict,

14:19.901 --> 14:22.699
but it had nothing
to do with chess or poetry.

14:22.771 --> 14:24.762
Oh, l'm sorry.

14:26.541 --> 14:29.772
Odd, the contents
of his files are missing.

14:31.379 --> 14:33.677
That is Vince?

14:33.748 --> 14:35.739
He looks so happy.

14:35.817 --> 14:38.718
He should.
That's Sister Maria,

14:38.787 --> 14:41.381
- his biology teacher.
- l always liked biology.

14:41.456 --> 14:43.356
So did Vincent.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.791
He disgraced Sister Maria,

14:45.860 --> 14:47.885
who had to leave the order.

14:47.962 --> 14:51.728
Then he stole all the money from
the library fund, and ran away.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.734
l must find my brother.

14:53.802 --> 14:56.236
Do you know
where he might be?

14:56.304 --> 14:59.205
Jail, a man of his character
can only be in jail.

14:59.274 --> 15:03.438
You're full of goodness, Julius.
l pray you never find him.

15:07.415 --> 15:09.940
Benedict, visitor.

15:59.501 --> 16:02.800
- l'm looking for Vincent Benedict.
- You got him.

16:30.465 --> 16:32.933
l have rowed halfway
across the world--

16:33.001 --> 16:35.060
Wrong, l just rowed a day--

16:38.473 --> 16:42.637
l've been looking forward to
this moment my whole life.

16:42.710 --> 16:45.201
l've been on my island,
l'm telling you.

16:45.280 --> 16:48.249
This is incredible that--
l have looked for--

16:56.724 --> 16:59.693
You've gotta talk
into the phone, Bozo.

17:01.296 --> 17:04.265
Vincent.
Yes, Vincent...

17:04.332 --> 17:06.630
l know you don't
know who l am.

17:06.701 --> 17:09.329
- But believe me, l came--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:09.404 --> 17:11.998
l've got another six hours
to pay the money back.

17:12.073 --> 17:15.236
Tell the Klane brothers that harassing
a man already in the slammer...

17:15.310 --> 17:17.574
is beneath even them,
all right?

17:17.645 --> 17:20.876
l don't know any Klane brothers.
l'm your brother, Julius.

17:22.116 --> 17:25.050
Huh? Come again?

17:25.118 --> 17:28.680
My name is Julius,
and l'm your twin brother.

17:30.558 --> 17:32.549
Oh, obviously.

17:32.627 --> 17:37.530
The moment l sat down, l thought
l was looking into a mirror.

17:37.599 --> 17:40.067
We are not
identical twins.

17:40.134 --> 17:42.227
- Oh, no?
- No.

17:42.303 --> 17:44.066
l wouldn't be
too sure, pal.

17:44.138 --> 17:46.038
l don't lie.
l am your brother.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.575
You must let me help
you get out of here.

17:48.643 --> 17:51.134
You want to
help me get out?

17:51.212 --> 17:52.702
Yes, right now.

17:52.780 --> 17:56.614
Well, money talks,
and bullshit walks.

18:00.655 --> 18:03.522
How can bullshit walk?
That's slang, huh?

18:03.591 --> 18:05.183
Yeah.

18:05.260 --> 18:07.194
l'm in fast company here.

18:07.262 --> 18:09.787
Take a look over there.
See that man?

18:09.864 --> 18:12.958
Pay him money, all right?
They let me out.

18:13.034 --> 18:15.502
l'll be anything you want,
your aunt, uncle, sister...

18:15.570 --> 18:17.504
your cousin,
brother-in-law, anything.

18:17.572 --> 18:20.871
- All right?
- Okay, l pay right now.

18:20.942 --> 18:22.534
- You pay now.
- Okay, Vince.

18:22.610 --> 18:24.703
Okay. Go pay.

18:24.779 --> 18:26.770
All right, pay him.

18:28.783 --> 18:31.479
What is this,
''Candid Camera''?

18:32.887 --> 18:35.412
Ahhh, oof!

18:36.925 --> 18:40.520
Twinny, l hope you didn't
blow your wad on the tickets,

18:40.595 --> 18:44.395
because l'm gonna need
a lot more money to get my car.

18:44.465 --> 18:46.490
- l have more money.
- You do?

18:46.567 --> 18:49.661
l'm glad to help you.
Vincent, l'm your brother.

18:49.737 --> 18:52.001
- l love you.
- Whoa!

18:52.073 --> 18:55.065
Look, ease up
on the love talk,

18:55.143 --> 18:58.203
because l'm gonna be tossing
my cookies in a minute.

18:58.279 --> 19:00.474
Tossing your cookies?

19:00.548 --> 19:02.516
Oh, that's more slang!

19:02.583 --> 19:05.245
Where the hell is it?

19:06.521 --> 19:10.617
- This is your car, isn't it?
- Yeah, that's it.

19:10.692 --> 19:13.252
You pay a huge fine,
then they hide it on you.

19:13.328 --> 19:16.491
- How'd you know this was my car?
- We're twins!

19:16.564 --> 19:20.091
l'm so excited. Now we can
go to museums together,

19:20.168 --> 19:23.137
talk philosophy together,
read books together.

19:23.204 --> 19:25.672
- Play chess together.
- Get lost together.

19:29.610 --> 19:31.544
Vincent!

19:35.783 --> 19:38.274
He's so full of energy.

19:42.824 --> 19:44.758
Blue Sedan DeVille.

19:44.826 --> 19:47.294
This is beautiful.

19:47.362 --> 19:49.262
Where you guys going,
out to Hawaii?

19:49.330 --> 19:52.458
- Catch some of them big waves?
- Yeah, something like that.

19:52.533 --> 19:54.558
We have plenty
of room on level 4.

20:41.349 --> 20:43.874
l'll call you
next Saturday.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.385
Whoa, where you going
with my desk?

20:46.454 --> 20:48.388
Takin' back this
furniture, man.

20:48.456 --> 20:51.823
- You're six months behind.
- You're behind!

20:53.027 --> 20:55.257
Six months behind.
That's the problem.

20:55.329 --> 20:57.661
There's no trust
in the world anymore.

20:57.732 --> 21:00.292
l tried to stop them,
Mr. Benedict.

21:00.368 --> 21:02.427
That's all right, it was
time to redecorate anyway.

21:04.739 --> 21:06.798
Vincent Benedict lncorporated.

21:06.874 --> 21:08.933
- Sports agent...
- Airborne!

21:09.911 --> 21:13.278
- Mr. Benedict?
- Yeah?

21:13.347 --> 21:16.248
- lt's Al.
- lt's Al? Ooh, Al, Al, Al.

21:16.317 --> 21:19.115
Look, Miss Busby, uh--

21:19.187 --> 21:21.018
Al, hang on a second.

21:21.089 --> 21:24.183
The corporation's in
a transitional period right now.

21:24.258 --> 21:28.490
Take a couple of days off.
When we regroup, l'll call you.

21:28.563 --> 21:30.963
Whatever you think is best.

21:31.032 --> 21:33.023
- All right.
- l'll take this.

21:33.101 --> 21:35.035
Yeah, go ahead.
Take that.

21:35.103 --> 21:38.266
Before l forget,
happy birthday.

21:40.875 --> 21:43.639
Oh, how sweet.

21:43.711 --> 21:45.736
That's very,
very nice of you.

21:45.813 --> 21:49.840
- Aqua Velva?
- Mm-hmm.

21:49.917 --> 21:53.853
You shouldn't have.
Stacey.

21:55.823 --> 21:57.791
l'll give you
a call, okay?

21:57.859 --> 22:00.453
All right, all right.

22:00.528 --> 22:02.723
Al, save me!

22:02.797 --> 22:05.766
Brand-new Caddy on level 4.

22:05.867 --> 22:08.802
l'll be there!
Don't move! Bye.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.175
Whoa!

22:19.080 --> 22:20.911
Time's up, Vincent.

22:28.523 --> 22:31.583
Did you hit me?
Because l didn't feel a thing.

22:32.627 --> 22:34.561
l felt that.

22:34.629 --> 22:38.292
You gotta understand
something, Benedict.

22:38.366 --> 22:40.357
l like my work.

22:42.303 --> 22:45.136
These are the most unfriendly acts
you're committing.

22:45.206 --> 22:47.333
l don't know
what the problem is,

22:47.408 --> 22:49.569
but l'm sure it
can be resolved...

22:49.644 --> 22:51.942
- without resorting to violence.
- Yeah.

22:52.013 --> 22:53.674
Okay?

22:53.748 --> 22:56.114
Okay.

23:00.454 --> 23:02.513
- You moved too soon.
- He did?

23:02.590 --> 23:03.648
Ahhh!

23:05.226 --> 23:07.694
A little chest pain?

23:07.762 --> 23:11.289
The first rule
in a crisis situation:

23:11.365 --> 23:14.562
You negotiate first
and you attack last.

23:14.635 --> 23:16.569
You negotiate first,
then you attack.

23:16.637 --> 23:18.696
- You never negotiated.
- Na-hah!

23:18.773 --> 23:20.570
You don't know what
kind of an enemy l am.

23:20.641 --> 23:24.407
- Who are you?
- l'm Vincent's brother.

23:24.478 --> 23:26.639
- We're twins.
- That's right.

23:27.982 --> 23:30.007
- You're firewood!
- Axe, Axe, Axe!

23:31.552 --> 23:34.316
You have no respect
for logic.

23:34.388 --> 23:36.822
- But he's got an axe!
- Ahhhh!

23:40.761 --> 23:43.855
And l have no respect for those
who have no respect for logic.

23:46.334 --> 23:49.167
You're a very stupid person.

23:52.673 --> 23:54.937
You tell your brother,

23:55.009 --> 23:58.240
he messes with me, he messes
with my whole family!

24:02.817 --> 24:05.342
l love it when you
hit people, Julius.

24:05.419 --> 24:06.784
Boom!

24:07.488 --> 24:09.422
That was great!

24:09.490 --> 24:11.424
Actually,
l hate violence.

24:11.492 --> 24:13.426
But you're so good at it!

24:13.494 --> 24:15.792
l've got an idea. We should
go into business together.

24:15.863 --> 24:18.195
You could be a boxer.
l could be your manager.

24:18.266 --> 24:21.702
- l don't think l could fight for money.
- No problem!

24:21.769 --> 24:25.170
You do all the fighting,
l'll keep all the money.

24:25.239 --> 24:27.799
l'm really worried
about you, Vincent.

24:29.277 --> 24:31.711
How much money
do you owe?

24:31.779 --> 24:34.714
Don't lie to me.
We're twins.

24:34.782 --> 24:38.718
- l can feel your pain.
- Why do you keep saying that?

24:38.786 --> 24:40.777
We're not twins.
We're not brothers.

24:40.855 --> 24:42.789
We're nothin'!

24:47.728 --> 24:49.457
Twenty thousand.

24:50.898 --> 24:53.059
Due this morning.

24:58.973 --> 25:00.907
Come on.

25:11.098 --> 25:13.464
Don't worry about
anything, Vincent.

25:13.534 --> 25:17.334
As long as l'm with you,
l won't let anyone harm you, okay?

25:19.941 --> 25:24.378
Well, you're
a good guy, Julius.

25:24.445 --> 25:26.845
Now, hang on
to your seat!

25:37.325 --> 25:39.793
You know what?
l completely forgot.

25:39.861 --> 25:42.421
l promised this
friend, Sammy,

25:42.496 --> 25:44.760
that l'd pick his car up
from the airport.

25:44.832 --> 25:46.766
Put it in the slot.

25:46.834 --> 25:48.927
Would you do me
a big favor?

25:49.003 --> 25:52.166
Would you drive this car back
from the airport for me?

25:52.240 --> 25:54.174
Oh, l would love to.

25:54.242 --> 25:56.369
Good, that would
really be a big help.

25:56.444 --> 25:59.971
Do you have a manual, please?

26:01.415 --> 26:03.679
- A manual?
- Yeah.

26:04.986 --> 26:07.921
- lt's in the glove compartment.
- Oh, yeah.

26:07.989 --> 26:10.048
There it is.

26:17.365 --> 26:20.425
- What are you doin' with the finger?
- Learning to drive.

26:20.501 --> 26:22.298
Whoa!

26:23.337 --> 26:25.202
lt's not up here.

26:25.273 --> 26:27.639
Maybe it's under
the back tire.

26:27.708 --> 26:32.077
Look... l mean, usually he
leaves the keys behind the tire.

26:32.146 --> 26:33.841
- Geez!
- What's the matter?

26:33.915 --> 26:37.578
That dopey Sam,
he forgot to leave the keys.

26:37.652 --> 26:39.586
No. Oh, well.

26:39.654 --> 26:43.556
A lot of handicapped children
are gonna be very disappointed.

26:43.624 --> 26:45.717
Handicapped children?

26:45.793 --> 26:49.285
This car was supposed to be auctioned
off at their charity drive tomorrow.

26:49.363 --> 26:51.831
Oh, well. Let's go get
something to eat.

26:51.899 --> 26:54.094
Maybe we should try
to open it ourselves.

26:56.103 --> 26:58.333
Do you really think
we should do that?

26:58.406 --> 27:00.067
lt's for children.

27:02.176 --> 27:04.269
You got a point.

27:06.781 --> 27:10.308
l saw a guy from
the Auto Club do this once.

27:10.384 --> 27:13.012
What do you know,
beginners luck!

27:15.389 --> 27:18.256
These cars have
terrific alarms!

27:18.326 --> 27:20.760
l'll get it in a minute.

27:22.129 --> 27:24.256
Just a second, Jules.

27:25.833 --> 27:27.266
Whoa!

27:28.336 --> 27:29.894
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:40.214 --> 27:44.548
lf you lift the rear end at an angle
greater than 45 degrees...

27:44.618 --> 27:47.587
the mercury switch activates
the automatic cut-off system,

27:47.655 --> 27:50.021
so that the alarm's
computer thinks...

27:50.091 --> 27:52.423
that the car is being
towed and shuts off.

27:53.894 --> 27:56.522
Can l have the keys
to your car?

27:58.032 --> 28:00.592
You know,
the keys to your car?

28:00.668 --> 28:03.967
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No yodeling.

28:06.540 --> 28:08.474
Lovely day.

28:10.111 --> 28:11.908
Come on, Julius.

28:25.593 --> 28:28.562
Step on it!

28:30.064 --> 28:31.793
Yeeeoow!

28:44.345 --> 28:46.279
Oh, my God!

28:46.347 --> 28:49.646
- l am amazed at how well it's going.
- You're doing good.

28:49.717 --> 28:52.345
Don't use both feet
at the same time.

28:52.420 --> 28:56.413
- Just use the gas.
- Okay, one foot.

28:56.490 --> 28:58.481
- One pedal at a time.
- Okay! l will do it!

29:18.145 --> 29:20.545
Pick up the phone,
the phone.

29:20.614 --> 29:23.515
The little thing down on
the right that's making noise.

29:29.924 --> 29:32.893
This is Vincent's car.
Can l help you, please?

29:32.960 --> 29:35.588
- Julius!
- Vincent, where are you?

29:35.663 --> 29:38.291
Look in your rear-view mirror.
You see that little dot?

29:38.365 --> 29:41.391
That's me.

29:41.469 --> 29:43.266
Hello, yeah. Hello!

29:45.139 --> 29:46.731
What are you
doing back there?

29:46.807 --> 29:50.903
There's going to be a lot of
lights coming up, a supermarket.

29:50.978 --> 29:54.243
- Supermarket.
- Take your foot off the gas.

29:54.315 --> 29:57.807
Apply it to the brake.
lt's the thing next to the gas.

29:57.885 --> 29:58.817
The brake pedal.

29:58.886 --> 30:01.081
- Very gently.
- You got it.

30:02.156 --> 30:04.488
Bye, Vincent.

30:04.558 --> 30:06.685
All right.

30:11.031 --> 30:13.090
Okay, it's a supermarket.

30:20.841 --> 30:23.002
Ohhh!

30:23.611 --> 30:24.976
Ohhh!

30:36.357 --> 30:38.882
That's what l call fun.

30:38.959 --> 30:41.086
Did you see me
with the two wheels?

30:41.162 --> 30:43.722
l can teach
you that, Vincent.

30:43.797 --> 30:46.288
Julius, let me tell you
something about America.

30:46.367 --> 30:49.495
Nobody likes
a smart ass, all right?

30:49.603 --> 30:51.594
So, what do you think?

30:51.672 --> 30:53.731
Angel's food
or devil's food?

30:53.807 --> 30:55.741
Devil's.

30:55.809 --> 30:58.300
- You know what
l really love about Vince?
- What?

30:58.379 --> 31:01.109
He's a force of nature.

31:01.182 --> 31:03.047
- You're outta control.
- No, l'm not.

31:03.117 --> 31:05.881
That poetry he pretends to write,
they're old song lyrics.

31:05.953 --> 31:08.888
l know. Geez,
you think l don't know that!

31:08.956 --> 31:10.924
- l don't think you know that.
- Well, l do.

31:10.991 --> 31:14.757
lt's this style thing.
That's how he expresses himself.

31:14.828 --> 31:18.286
And he means it, even if
he doesn't know he means it.

31:18.365 --> 31:23.325
- Vince has a truly romantic soul.
- l can't hear this anymore.

31:23.404 --> 31:26.373
Well, don't, 'cause if you
had a boyfriend like l have,

31:26.440 --> 31:28.874
you'd make him a cake
and he'd love it...

31:28.943 --> 31:30.968
and you'd get laid.

31:45.125 --> 31:47.457
- Ah!
- Excuse me.

31:47.528 --> 31:50.326
Excuse me.

31:51.632 --> 31:53.623
She's not bad.

31:53.701 --> 31:57.262
l had no idea
that these magazines...

31:57.338 --> 32:01.638
had things like
this inside, inside them.

32:01.709 --> 32:04.542
You didn't? Where've you been?
A desert island?

32:04.612 --> 32:08.605
l come from a tropical island
in the South Pacific.

32:08.682 --> 32:12.413
lt's around 300 nautical miles,
south, southwest of Fiji.

32:14.121 --> 32:16.988
l just got here yesterday
and l already found my brother.

32:17.057 --> 32:18.820
Your brother?

32:18.892 --> 32:20.917
That's right.

32:20.995 --> 32:22.963
My twin brother, Vincent.

32:23.030 --> 32:26.295
- Twins?
- Vince!

32:26.367 --> 32:29.200
- Linda.
- Hi.

32:29.270 --> 32:32.137
Oh, you look gorgeous
in this light.

32:32.206 --> 32:34.299
- You do.
- Really?

32:39.446 --> 32:41.971
Hi. Who's this guy?

32:42.049 --> 32:43.983
This is Vincent's brother.

32:44.051 --> 32:47.452
- l didn't know you had a brother.
- Me, either.

32:47.521 --> 32:49.284
You know each other?

32:49.356 --> 32:51.950
Allow me to introduce
these lovely ladies.

32:52.026 --> 32:55.894
- This is Linda.
- Hi.

32:55.963 --> 32:58.830
- Hello.
- Her charming sister, Marnie.

33:01.602 --> 33:04.002
Sisters?

33:04.071 --> 33:06.232
Twins?

33:06.307 --> 33:08.867
Are you sure
this guy's all right?

33:08.942 --> 33:11.502
He's okay.
He's helping me out.

33:11.578 --> 33:14.775
He's from outta town,
kinda latched on to me.

33:14.848 --> 33:17.749
Okay, well, great seeing ya.

33:17.818 --> 33:20.548
Catch ya later.

33:20.621 --> 33:23.590
Great seeing ya.
Catch ya later.

33:23.657 --> 33:25.625
Oops!

33:28.195 --> 33:32.222
l've only been
driving an hour.

33:34.101 --> 33:37.969
- Linda's your girlfriend, isn't she?
- Yeah, kinda.

33:38.038 --> 33:41.303
- ls Marnie your girlfriend, too?
- Marnie?

33:41.375 --> 33:45.141
Marnie hates my guts.
She kinda likes you, though.

33:45.212 --> 33:47.476
- Me?
- Yeah.

33:47.548 --> 33:51.279
- She hardly knows me.
- That's the best way.

33:51.352 --> 33:53.877
You see,
women love men...

33:53.954 --> 33:56.286
who are mysterious
and devious.

33:56.357 --> 33:58.325
Keeps them on their toes.

33:58.392 --> 34:01.623
-lt excites them. You know what l mean?
-No.

34:01.695 --> 34:04.391
- You do like women?
- Very much so.

34:04.465 --> 34:06.433
They're strange
and sensitive.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.900
They have compassion.

34:08.969 --> 34:11.995
l have the highest
respect for women.

34:15.775 --> 34:18.574
You're a virgin!

34:21.815 --> 34:24.545
That's private.

34:26.219 --> 34:28.984
A 230-pound virgin.

34:29.056 --> 34:32.184
lt's all right.
lt's something--

34:32.259 --> 34:35.092
lt's just one
of those things.

34:35.161 --> 34:38.757
Oh, Julius.
My little baby poodle.

34:40.134 --> 34:43.592
Such a baby cat.
Look, did l neglect you?

34:43.670 --> 34:45.967
Not anymore. Come on.

34:46.039 --> 34:49.132
That's a good little pussy cat.
This is sweet Julius.

34:49.208 --> 34:51.302
Okay, here you go.

34:51.378 --> 34:53.744
You named
your cat Julius?

34:59.253 --> 35:04.156
The secret to take-out eggplant
parmesan is extra cheese.

35:04.224 --> 35:06.954
- There we go.
- That much cheese?

35:07.027 --> 35:09.325
Oh, yeah.
The more cheese, the merrier.

35:09.396 --> 35:11.364
There you go.

35:11.432 --> 35:15.630
l know you're probably used to
growing your own vegetables...

35:15.702 --> 35:19.399
and spearing fish on the lagoon,
but here on the mainland,

35:19.473 --> 35:22.033
we just nuke it.

35:22.109 --> 35:25.567
That's it. Here we go.

35:25.646 --> 35:30.413
Feast your eyes.
Dinner is served.

35:30.484 --> 35:33.942
- Yummy.
- Yeah.

35:48.001 --> 35:49.969
- Ahhh!
- Ahhh!

35:50.037 --> 35:52.335
Through the lips, over the gums,
look out--

35:52.406 --> 35:55.773
Look out stomach, here it comes.
Ta-dum!

35:55.843 --> 35:58.539
- Julius!
- Oh, l like nuked food.

35:58.612 --> 36:01.513
- Mm-mmm!
- Mmm!

36:26.106 --> 36:28.336
Now let me get
this straight.

36:28.408 --> 36:30.933
One of our fathers was
a famous football player?

36:31.011 --> 36:32.945
- Yes!
- And another one was...

36:33.013 --> 36:36.915
- a physicist at M.l.T.?
- Yes, he won the Nobel Prize.

36:36.984 --> 36:40.317
Naturally! All of our dads
were these big shots.

36:40.387 --> 36:42.412
And Mom...

36:42.489 --> 36:45.481
was like... superwoman.

36:46.860 --> 36:50.956
But she didn't survive
the delivery.

36:51.031 --> 36:53.625
And l was sent
to an orphanage,

36:53.700 --> 36:56.396
while you were raised
on a tropical paradise...

36:56.470 --> 36:59.166
by a scientist who
you do research for,

36:59.239 --> 37:02.299
but who doesn't pay you,
because you don't need money.

37:02.376 --> 37:04.708
Did l leave anything out?

37:04.778 --> 37:08.714
l think it's important we try
to find our fathers.

37:08.782 --> 37:11.580
Oh, you mean the geniuses
who contributed...

37:11.652 --> 37:13.916
to the sperm milk shake.

37:13.987 --> 37:16.387
Why are you being so immature
about all this?

37:16.456 --> 37:19.425
Do you know how many times
l've heard stories like this?

37:19.493 --> 37:22.155
lt's every
orphan's fantasy.

37:22.229 --> 37:24.663
My real mom and dad
were rich...

37:24.731 --> 37:26.756
and beautiful.

37:26.833 --> 37:29.563
But there was a mix-up
in the hospital...

37:29.636 --> 37:32.605
and l got switched
with another baby.

37:32.673 --> 37:35.301
But one day, there's gonna
be a knock at the door...

37:35.375 --> 37:37.400
and there they'll be...

37:37.477 --> 37:42.107
with open arms,
crying, ''My darling.

37:42.182 --> 37:45.379
''My treasure.
We didn't know.

37:45.452 --> 37:47.682
How can we make
it up to you?''

37:47.754 --> 37:50.382
Let me tell you something
for your own good, Julius.

37:50.457 --> 37:52.456
lt's a crock.

37:54.892 --> 37:58.293
l liberated this from
my file at the orphanage.

38:00.064 --> 38:03.124
Here it is.
Read it and weep.

38:03.200 --> 38:06.658
''Dear Sister Anderson, your request
for orphan's benefits...

38:06.737 --> 38:09.729
- ''for Vincent Benedict has been denied.
- Denied, yeah.

38:09.807 --> 38:14.073
''According to our files,
his mother did not die...

38:14.144 --> 38:16.044
- ''during birth.
- She's not dead.

38:16.113 --> 38:18.547
''We have a current
address for her at...

38:18.616 --> 38:20.675
''172 Canyon Glen Drive,
Los Angeles.

38:20.751 --> 38:23.618
''Vincent's case seems to be
one of simple abandonment,

38:23.687 --> 38:26.588
and as such,
he's ineligible for aid.''

38:26.657 --> 38:30.149
That's right, Julius.
She abandoned me.

38:34.164 --> 38:36.496
This letter was written
30 years ago.

38:36.567 --> 38:39.001
We were five years old.

38:39.069 --> 38:41.162
Our mother didn't die
when we were born!

38:41.238 --> 38:43.798
You knew all this time
where she was...

38:43.874 --> 38:46.069
and you never
contacted her?

38:46.143 --> 38:50.637
l don't know about your mother,
''Miss Perfect, 1952,''

38:50.714 --> 38:53.979
but my mother was a slut
and if she's still alive,

38:54.051 --> 38:56.076
l hope she's
in a lot of pain.

38:56.153 --> 38:58.087
She dumped me once.

38:58.155 --> 39:00.680
There is no way l'm gonna give
her a chance to do it again.

39:00.758 --> 39:03.693
lf they have lied to us about Mama
for all these years,

39:03.761 --> 39:06.958
maybe they lied to her, too.
We got to find her.

39:07.031 --> 39:09.727
- We have to check this address.
- You do what you want.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.859
l got a cash-flow problem.

39:11.936 --> 39:15.667
- Hello.
- Hey, Vince, we haven't
forgotten about you.

39:15.739 --> 39:18.173
You better have our money
tomorrow morning, or else.

39:18.242 --> 39:20.540
Or else what, you blimp?

39:32.056 --> 39:34.183
Oh, we're rollin'.

39:34.258 --> 39:37.159
Tests on the new low-temperature
gaskets look great.

39:37.227 --> 39:39.161
- Mr. Garfield, there's a man--
- Not now.

39:46.136 --> 39:49.469
- Who are you?
- l'm Webster.

39:51.575 --> 39:54.669
- lt's okay!
- Christ! You were never
supposed to come here.

39:54.745 --> 39:56.872
We were never
supposed to meet.

39:56.947 --> 40:00.246
- You're supposed to be--
- Driving that car down to Texas.

40:00.317 --> 40:03.809
l got my driving gloves.
l got my driving glasses.

40:03.887 --> 40:05.787
l got my driving hat.

40:05.856 --> 40:08.381
But l got no car.

40:08.459 --> 40:11.292
The car was there.
The merchandise was in the trunk.

40:11.362 --> 40:13.455
Your instructions
were on the cassette.

40:13.530 --> 40:16.363
He wants more money.
That's what this is about.

40:16.433 --> 40:20.130
- He wants more money.
- Whoa, whoa. Let me explain.

40:20.204 --> 40:21.694
Sit down.

40:23.640 --> 40:26.609
l got a reputation
to uphold.

40:26.677 --> 40:29.339
People put their trust in me.

40:29.413 --> 40:31.404
They know l always
deliver the goods...

40:31.482 --> 40:33.882
and l always come
back with the money.

40:33.951 --> 40:36.647
This is making me look
very bad professionally.

40:36.720 --> 40:40.212
- This is bullshit. The car was there.
- That's right.

40:40.290 --> 40:42.918
The parking attendant
thought we were going to Hawaii.

40:42.993 --> 40:45.427
- The parking attendant?
- He liked the car.

40:45.496 --> 40:47.964
We put on those loud shirts
so we'd look like tourists.

40:48.032 --> 40:51.627
You know,
l just realized that...

40:51.702 --> 40:54.637
in over 20 years of service,
not one of my clients...

40:54.705 --> 40:56.639
has ever seen my face.

40:56.707 --> 40:59.505
l don't think that's
a problem. Hey!

41:00.544 --> 41:03.104
No, please, please!

41:22.566 --> 41:25.467
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:25.536 --> 41:30.200
- Oh, excuse me, could you
tell me who lives here?
- Grandpa,

41:30.274 --> 41:32.640
this man wants
to talk to you.

41:32.709 --> 41:35.803
Thank you.

41:38.649 --> 41:40.617
Hello?

41:40.684 --> 41:42.652
Yes, can l help you?

41:42.719 --> 41:44.812
l'm terribly sorry
to disturb your party.

41:44.888 --> 41:46.822
l know this may
sound strange,

41:46.890 --> 41:50.257
but l'm looking for someone
that lived here a long time ago.

41:50.327 --> 41:53.296
Mary Ann Benedict.

41:58.769 --> 42:01.101
She was my mother.

42:04.942 --> 42:07.342
You're Mary Ann's son?

42:07.411 --> 42:12.280
That looks just
like you, Grandpa.

42:12.349 --> 42:14.544
Honey, why don't
you go inside...

42:14.618 --> 42:17.485
and help Grandma
with lunch, okay?

42:29.900 --> 42:31.959
Dad?

42:32.035 --> 42:34.970
Uh... no!

42:35.038 --> 42:39.168
- But maybe technically speaking.
- Dad!

42:39.243 --> 42:41.336
Dad!

42:41.411 --> 42:43.743
- Wait a minute!
- Dad! lt is you!

42:43.814 --> 42:45.941
This is a big surprise.

42:46.016 --> 42:48.314
Dad, this is incredible.
l don't know what to--

42:48.385 --> 42:50.819
We could use a drink.
Where'd you come from?

42:50.888 --> 42:53.789
One of my fathers! You don't know
what this means to me.

43:11.041 --> 43:14.738
Uh, Mr. Webster, l hope you are
happy with the vehicle...

43:14.811 --> 43:18.303
we chose for
your little journey.

43:18.382 --> 43:22.478
When you get near Houston,
phone 713-555-0342...

43:22.553 --> 43:26.182
and ask for uh, uh,
Beetroot McKinley.

43:26.256 --> 43:30.215
He will arrange to trade you a briefcase
for the merchandise in the trunk.

43:30.294 --> 43:32.319
Thank you.

43:32.396 --> 43:35.365
Mary Ann Benedict.

43:35.432 --> 43:40.096
l haven't said that name
out loud for over 30 years.

43:40.170 --> 43:42.798
Your mother was...

43:42.873 --> 43:45.239
an amazing woman.

43:45.309 --> 43:49.837
Oh, the times l've wondered what would
have happened if l'd have married her.

43:49.913 --> 43:52.245
Why didn't you?

43:52.316 --> 43:56.047
Oh, l asked her to.
She turned me down.

43:56.119 --> 43:59.782
She said she was afraid...

43:59.856 --> 44:02.416
to have any more children.

44:02.492 --> 44:05.484
See, they told her
you had died at birth.

44:05.562 --> 44:08.224
Who told her we died?

44:13.070 --> 44:15.300
Mitchell Traven,
the guy with the clipboard.

44:15.372 --> 44:18.398
He supervised the experiment
for the government.

44:18.475 --> 44:22.844
He still runs a genetics lab
at Los Alamos, New Mexico.

44:22.913 --> 44:25.245
l'll have to pay
him a visit.

44:25.315 --> 44:27.545
Watch out for him.

44:27.618 --> 44:31.349
He's kind of a dickhead,
if you know what l mean.

44:31.421 --> 44:35.118
Dickhead?

44:35.192 --> 44:37.717
No, l don't.

44:37.794 --> 44:41.025
But... l'm learning.

44:46.236 --> 44:49.000
l'm concerned about the time frame.

44:49.072 --> 44:51.939
That's my private line, honey.
l'll take care of that.

44:52.009 --> 44:54.443
You boys, excuse me.

45:00.951 --> 45:03.215
Beetroot McKinley talkin'.
Who is this?

45:05.222 --> 45:07.156
Uh, Webster.

45:07.224 --> 45:11.217
l'm callin' from California.
l happen to have something--

45:11.295 --> 45:14.890
Some merchandise
that you might want.

45:14.965 --> 45:17.695
Well, bring it to me, son.

45:17.768 --> 45:19.759
Let me enrich you.

45:19.836 --> 45:22.202
Well, uh, Mr. Beetroot,

45:22.272 --> 45:24.536
it's the amount
of enrichment...

45:24.608 --> 45:26.803
that l wanted
to talk about.

45:26.877 --> 45:30.472
Don't try and renegotiate
with old Beetroot, son.

45:30.547 --> 45:33.038
Now look, Beetroot,

45:33.116 --> 45:36.347
if we can't renegotiate,
we wither and die.

45:36.420 --> 45:38.980
Look, there's no way,
Mr. Beetroot,

45:39.056 --> 45:42.787
that l am going to deliver
any damn Cadillac...

45:42.859 --> 45:47.455
unless l know for sure
that l have...

45:47.531 --> 45:49.965
twenty for my cut.

45:50.033 --> 45:53.196
Twenty! You little
shit-for-brains peckerwood!

45:53.270 --> 45:55.261
You're out of your
goddamn, greedy mind!

45:55.339 --> 46:00.038
- l guess that seems
a little high for you.
- Yeah!

46:01.611 --> 46:05.570
l'm a reasonable man.
How about fifteen?

46:05.649 --> 46:10.143
- The deal is five!
- Five?

46:10.220 --> 46:12.415
l could do better
than five here.

46:14.291 --> 46:18.284
lf you can do better
than five million dollars,

46:18.362 --> 46:21.820
well, then, son,
you take it.

46:36.113 --> 46:39.549
Beetroot,
l'll see you in Houston.

46:39.616 --> 46:41.777
After all, fair is fair.

46:41.852 --> 46:45.720
l'll just have to find it in
my heart to live with your offer.

46:45.789 --> 46:49.054
Well, good.

46:59.002 --> 47:01.197
Five million!

47:01.271 --> 47:03.501
Five million dollars!

47:03.573 --> 47:05.803
Five mil-l-lion dollars!

47:05.876 --> 47:07.969
Five million dollars!

47:08.044 --> 47:11.411
Five, five million dollars!

47:11.481 --> 47:14.348
Five million dollars!

47:14.418 --> 47:17.683
Five m-m-million!

47:20.390 --> 47:22.824
Cash, lots of cash.

47:22.893 --> 47:25.123
Whoa!

47:25.195 --> 47:28.995
Listen, the most amazing thing
has happened, Vincent.

47:29.065 --> 47:33.092
- You scared the living shit outta me.
- l met one of our fathers.

47:33.170 --> 47:35.331
He told me about
a man in New Mexico...

47:35.405 --> 47:38.841
- who probably knows where Mom is.
- Oh, great! Yes!

47:38.909 --> 47:41.377
- Listen, she didn't abandon you.
- No?

47:41.445 --> 47:44.039
You know what l mean?
She didn't abandon you.

47:44.114 --> 47:46.139
- She didn't even know you were born.
- Oh!

47:46.216 --> 47:49.549
- They told her that l died.
- No kidding?

47:49.619 --> 47:52.349
Look, Julius,
l'm in a hurry.

47:52.422 --> 47:55.823
- You know Sammy, who gave me this car?
- Yeah.

47:55.892 --> 47:59.055
You remember Sammy? He wants me
to take this car to Houston.

47:59.129 --> 48:02.462
- So l'm gonna be gone a couple of days.
- Houston?

48:02.532 --> 48:03.521
Hous--

48:03.600 --> 48:06.626
- Hou-- No!
- You know something?

48:06.703 --> 48:09.695
New Mexico's on
the way to Houston.

48:09.773 --> 48:13.937
A lot of places are
on the way to Houston.

48:14.010 --> 48:16.911
Use the house,
make some phone calls.

48:16.980 --> 48:20.006
Throw wild parties.
Take advantage of your brother.

48:20.083 --> 48:23.109
We have to see this man, Traven,
in New Mexico.

48:23.186 --> 48:26.178
- No, we don't have to see
this man in New Mexico.
- Yes, we do!

48:26.256 --> 48:29.248
And l'm coming with you.

48:35.165 --> 48:37.190
We'll go see the man.

48:37.267 --> 48:40.464
- l take a shower. l get my bags.
- Get your bags.

48:40.537 --> 48:42.903
Be right out. Oh, boy!

48:42.973 --> 48:46.136
l'll be here, bro.
Okay.

48:53.984 --> 48:56.179
This place is a zoo!

48:56.253 --> 48:59.552
Wait, wait.

49:01.424 --> 49:04.052
- Happy birthday, Vince.
- Oh.

49:04.127 --> 49:08.029
- Happy birthday, Vince.
- God.

49:08.098 --> 49:12.000
- lt's not my birthday.
Better late than never.
- Oh.

49:12.068 --> 49:15.164
Look what Marnie
made for Julius.

49:15.298 --> 49:17.994
- You baked?
- Yeah. ls Julius around?

49:18.067 --> 49:22.834
- He's taking a shower.
- l'll go give these to him.

49:22.905 --> 49:24.270
So-o-o!

49:24.340 --> 49:28.037
- Where'd you get this car?
- Sammy. You know Sammy.

49:28.110 --> 49:32.308
- Where you going?
- lnside. Have some coffee?

49:32.381 --> 49:36.374
You're going somewhere and you
weren't even gonna say good-bye.

49:36.452 --> 49:39.012
Take out your papers and your trash

49:39.088 --> 49:42.114
Or you don't get
no spending cash

49:42.191 --> 49:45.024
lf you don't scrub
the kitchen floor

49:45.094 --> 49:47.221
You ain't gonna
rock and roll no more

49:47.296 --> 49:49.890
Yakety-yak yakety-yak
Don't talk back

49:49.966 --> 49:51.558
Marnie!

49:52.969 --> 49:56.803
Excuse me, but l was
just taking a shower.

49:56.872 --> 49:58.806
Good singing.

49:58.874 --> 50:01.240
l baked you some cookies.

50:01.310 --> 50:04.279
- Cookies?
- l guess it was a dumb idea.

50:04.347 --> 50:08.545
No, not at all. l'm really
looking forward to tossing them.

50:12.622 --> 50:15.523
- l should put on some clothes.
- l'm sorry, l'll turn around.

50:15.591 --> 50:18.890
Linda and l just came by
'cause she baked him a cake...

50:18.961 --> 50:21.828
- for his birthday.
- l had birthday, too.

50:21.897 --> 50:23.956
Oh, that's right.

50:24.033 --> 50:27.161
You're twins.

50:31.874 --> 50:33.933
Huh?

50:34.010 --> 50:35.978
Whoa.

50:36.045 --> 50:39.640
What is it?

50:39.715 --> 50:42.707
l don't know what it is,
but it's worth a fortune.

50:42.785 --> 50:45.345
- A fortune? That's great!
- Yeah!

50:45.421 --> 50:47.355
Excuse me!

50:48.691 --> 50:50.488
Excuse me.

50:50.559 --> 50:52.959
Never sleep with that man,
never loan him money,

50:53.029 --> 50:57.193
never believe a word he
tells you. That's free advice.

50:57.266 --> 51:01.362
- Good morning, Agnes.
- Vince?

51:01.437 --> 51:04.668
l cleaned her pipes once.
Let's go have a cup of coffee.

51:04.740 --> 51:08.107
Vincent,
l'm comin' with you.

51:08.177 --> 51:10.441
Linda, no,
you're not coming with me.

51:10.513 --> 51:12.674
- Yes, l am.
- No, you're not coming.

51:12.748 --> 51:16.149
You could get killed and die and
l wouldn't know what happened.

51:16.218 --> 51:18.584
- No!
- You say ''no'' one more time,

51:18.654 --> 51:22.420
-l'm gonna tell everybody that there's--
-Shut up! Shut up!

51:26.262 --> 51:28.992
All right. Oh, God.

51:29.065 --> 51:31.226
All right, you're coming.

51:31.300 --> 51:35.498
But you do not tell Julius
what's in that trunk.

51:35.571 --> 51:38.062
He thinks we're going
to look up our ancestors...

51:38.140 --> 51:40.370
like in ''Roots'' or something.
All right?

51:40.443 --> 51:42.604
- Does this one look okay?
- lt looks fine.

51:42.678 --> 51:46.170
lt's good you didn't have
to borrow his pants.

51:46.248 --> 51:49.775
- Marnie, guess what?
- Linda, what?

51:49.852 --> 51:52.844
Vince just asked us to go to New Mexico
and Texas with him.

51:52.922 --> 51:55.288
This is a great idea.

51:55.357 --> 51:59.020
- Vincent, is this true?
We all go together?
- Yeah.

51:59.095 --> 52:02.462
l thought it was a great idea
if we all hopped in the car...

52:02.531 --> 52:04.465
and spent a few days
on the road together.

52:04.533 --> 52:06.660
Nice shirt.

52:06.736 --> 52:11.935
- Feels great. lt's all cotton.
- Well, it breathes.

52:13.375 --> 52:15.935
lt's okay. Come out.

52:16.011 --> 52:18.775
All right. Here, Linda.

52:18.848 --> 52:22.249
Oh, can l ride
in front with Vincent?

52:22.318 --> 52:24.479
- Sure.
- Thanks.

52:40.302 --> 52:42.395
Now, let me see.

52:42.471 --> 52:44.939
l'm supposed to be
giving you one of these.

52:45.007 --> 52:47.168
Sorry, it's my first day
on the job.

52:47.243 --> 52:49.973
Have a nice day.

52:53.048 --> 52:57.314
Now, where do l find
this very special person,

52:57.386 --> 53:01.049
Mr. Vince Benedict?

53:29.618 --> 53:32.610
Well, what have we here?

53:32.688 --> 53:35.452
What a cute little kitty.

53:35.524 --> 53:37.685
Where's Daddy?

53:47.102 --> 53:51.664
Well, well, well.
Thank you very much.

53:51.740 --> 53:53.799
Open up, Vince.
We know you're in there.

53:53.876 --> 53:56.436
Come on, we just
wanna talk to you.

53:56.512 --> 53:59.504
Howdy!

54:01.050 --> 54:04.713
Who are you?

54:04.787 --> 54:06.721
lt's not really
important, is it?

54:06.789 --> 54:08.780
l was just feeding the cat,
then l was gonna leave.

54:08.858 --> 54:10.758
l asked you a question.

54:10.826 --> 54:14.023
- Well, who are you?
- We're the Klane brothers.

54:14.096 --> 54:16.291
That's Burt, this is
Morris, and l'm Bob.

54:16.365 --> 54:20.825
- lnteresting gene pool.
- Don't cast dispersions.

54:20.903 --> 54:23.895
l beg your pardon. But you're
looking for Vince Benedict.

54:23.973 --> 54:26.237
- Right.
- Am l Vince Benedict?

54:27.776 --> 54:29.710
So what difference
does it make who l am?

54:29.778 --> 54:32.906
- Hit him, Bobby.
- Yeah.

54:32.982 --> 54:34.813
Hey! All right.

54:34.884 --> 54:36.875
Your brothers seem to have
a problem with their feet.

54:36.952 --> 54:40.410
- Could be contagious. Bye, bye.
- Ow! Ow!

54:40.489 --> 54:45.392
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

54:48.430 --> 54:50.796
- You want a doctor?
- Ow!

54:50.866 --> 54:53.835
l'll call a doctor.

55:41.984 --> 55:45.715
Sorry l tore your shirt.
l don't know what happened.

55:45.788 --> 55:47.756
lt's all right.

55:47.823 --> 55:49.757
- Julius!
- What?

55:49.825 --> 55:53.192
- Are you allergic to something?
- No.

55:53.262 --> 55:56.231
Then why are these bumps
all over your body?

55:56.298 --> 55:59.597
You're all swelled up.
You look like you're ready to explode.

55:59.668 --> 56:03.604
Put this shirt on. There are
women and children present.

56:03.672 --> 56:06.664
And your back,
it's worse than the front.

56:06.742 --> 56:10.405
- lt's like North Dakota.
- You're so funny, Vincent.

56:12.514 --> 56:14.607
This is for the T-shirt
and the sandwiches.

56:17.019 --> 56:21.285
- Born to be bad.
- Yes, we are.

56:21.357 --> 56:23.689
Ooh, you're so scary.

56:23.759 --> 56:25.920
Linda.

56:25.995 --> 56:28.463
Linda!

56:28.530 --> 56:30.794
Well, what do you think?

56:30.866 --> 56:36.099
- Let's rock and roll.
- lt's his first T-shirt.

56:54.523 --> 56:56.582
- Honey, honey.
- Yeah?

56:56.658 --> 57:00.150
See if you can get us
a room with a king-size bed?

57:00.229 --> 57:03.221
- Right.
- We'll get us settled.
We'll meet you here.

57:03.298 --> 57:07.029
- Okay.
- Good-bye.

57:07.102 --> 57:10.799
l don't need a king-size bed.
l always sleep on the floor.

57:10.939 --> 57:15.308
Uh, l don't know, Jules.
l hope this is a good idea.

57:15.377 --> 57:18.904
Come on.

57:18.981 --> 57:22.109
Now, look,
promise me something.

57:22.184 --> 57:26.621
lf this Professor Traven
has never heard of,

57:26.688 --> 57:29.248
you know,
Mom or us twins...

57:29.324 --> 57:32.191
or all our dads
or the experiment,

57:32.261 --> 57:34.456
you won't be upset.

57:34.530 --> 57:37.465
All l want him to do
is tell us the truth.

57:37.533 --> 57:40.400
l don't know who you are
and what you're talking about.

57:40.469 --> 57:44.371
Get the hell out of here
before l call security.

57:44.440 --> 57:49.139
Well, that's that.
On to Houston.

57:49.211 --> 57:53.079
- He's lying!
- Take it easy. He said
he was gonna call security.

57:53.148 --> 57:56.777
For the first time in my life,
l'm pissed off!

57:56.852 --> 57:58.843
Julius, don't do this to me.
l got a car to deliver.

57:58.921 --> 58:01.253
The last thing l need is
a detour in the slammer.

58:01.323 --> 58:04.053
- l'm gonna make him tell us the truth.
- No!

58:06.995 --> 58:09.657
That's our mother.
Those are our six fathers.

58:09.731 --> 58:12.666
That's Werner.
And that is you.

58:12.734 --> 58:17.569
- So start talking.
- Everything okay, Dr. Traven?

58:19.942 --> 58:22.433
Um, yes. lt's okay.

58:22.511 --> 58:24.741
l'll take care of it.

58:28.050 --> 58:31.816
Well, Vincent,

58:33.555 --> 58:35.682
you turned out just like
l thought you would.

58:35.757 --> 58:37.691
What did you do,
escape from prison?

58:42.264 --> 58:44.960
How'd you know my name?

58:47.102 --> 58:49.036
l named you.

59:03.252 --> 59:07.279
We sealed this door
the day after you were born.

59:22.905 --> 59:26.238
Well, come on in.
This is what you wanted to see.

59:40.589 --> 59:44.252
You came out first,
of course.

59:44.326 --> 59:46.260
We weren't expecting...

59:46.328 --> 59:47.852
him.

59:49.264 --> 59:52.597
This, uh...

59:52.668 --> 59:55.034
must be where you
made the milk shake.

59:55.103 --> 59:58.163
We weren't
making milk shakes.

59:58.240 --> 01:00:02.074
We were making the most fully-developed
human the world has ever seen.

01:00:02.144 --> 01:00:05.773
But instead of just
one perfect kid,

01:00:05.847 --> 01:00:10.250
-Mom had the two of us. Way to go, Mom!
-Wrong!

01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:13.777
The embryo did split
in two, but...

01:00:13.855 --> 01:00:16.323
it didn't split equally.

01:00:16.391 --> 01:00:20.623
All the purity and
strength went into Julius.

01:00:20.696 --> 01:00:22.664
All the crap
that was left over...

01:00:22.731 --> 01:00:25.291
went into what you see
in the mirror every morning.

01:00:25.367 --> 01:00:27.426
Whoa. You telling me
l'm the crap?

01:00:27.502 --> 01:00:30.335
- This is not true.
- Wait, Julius.

01:00:30.405 --> 01:00:34.136
You're telling me that l am
the leftover crap? l'm no good?

01:00:34.209 --> 01:00:37.235
- He's wrong.
- Look at him.

01:00:39.715 --> 01:00:44.175
Are you saying that
l'm a side effect?

01:00:44.253 --> 01:00:47.313
You haven't got the brain power
to understand this...

01:00:47.389 --> 01:00:50.950
and l haven't got the time.
Show's over.

01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:56.354
Hey, dickhead.

01:00:56.431 --> 01:00:59.059
Tell us where
our mother is.

01:00:59.134 --> 01:01:02.160
Um... Whispering Pines.

01:01:02.237 --> 01:01:05.729
lt's an artists' colony
200 miles north of Santa Fe.

01:01:09.911 --> 01:01:14.245
lf you're lying to me,
l'll be back.

01:01:25.193 --> 01:01:27.320
Come on.

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:45.762
My life just got
flushed down the toilet.

01:01:45.834 --> 01:01:50.567
No, Vincent. Your life
is just about to begin.

01:01:50.639 --> 01:01:53.335
l'm genetic garbage.

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:57.243
We're twins.
We're basically the same.

01:01:57.313 --> 01:02:01.147
Julius, l know this is
a touchy subject for you,

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:03.845
but we don't look the same,
we don't act the same,

01:02:03.919 --> 01:02:07.047
- we don't talk the same,
we don't dress the same.
- l know.

01:02:07.122 --> 01:02:10.523
So if we're so much the same,
how come we're so different?

01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:13.061
We had six fathers.

01:02:13.128 --> 01:02:15.961
We're different parts of
a lot of different people.

01:02:16.031 --> 01:02:18.591
Yeah?

01:02:18.667 --> 01:02:22.763
Don't forget. l was taken
to a beautiful island.

01:02:22.838 --> 01:02:25.705
l was loved. l was
protected, educated.

01:02:25.774 --> 01:02:29.039
You had nobody, Vincent.

01:02:29.111 --> 01:02:32.842
Nobody to love you,
to trust you, to encourage you.

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:35.850
All life taught you was
that the only person you...

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:38.978
could count on was yourself.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:48.296
You see, Vincent,

01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:51.925
you're the missing part
of my life.

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:55.095
And l'm the missing part
of your life.

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:57.331
When we find Mama,

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.897
we can fill the
missing part of hers.

01:03:02.711 --> 01:03:05.680
We won't be alone anymore.

01:03:05.748 --> 01:03:09.377
We can be a family.

01:03:14.890 --> 01:03:17.484
A family?

01:03:17.559 --> 01:03:19.493
Yes.

01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:24.392
You mean, like,
with a Christmas tree,

01:03:24.466 --> 01:03:26.627
and Thanksgiving dinner?

01:03:26.702 --> 01:03:28.670
And a real home,

01:03:28.737 --> 01:03:33.106
where you'll
always be welcome.

01:03:33.175 --> 01:03:35.336
Always?

01:03:35.411 --> 01:03:39.404
Even when you've been bad.

01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:48.715
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:50.782
Yeah, yeah, ooh.

01:03:50.859 --> 01:03:53.987
Yes, um-mm. Oh, look.

01:03:54.063 --> 01:03:57.294
- ls this really necessary?
- Yes, of course it's necessary.

01:03:57.366 --> 01:04:00.893
l'm not going to introduce
you to my mother looking
like a goat herder from Albania.

01:04:00.969 --> 01:04:02.937
You need clothes.

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:05.769
- But l feel fine the way l am.
- But you look like a--

01:04:05.841 --> 01:04:09.140
- Hello, can l help you?
- Do l look like l need help?

01:04:09.211 --> 01:04:12.271
Here's the problem.
We gotta do a whole ensemble.

01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:27.058
-Do l look okay?
-You look better. Let's put it that way.

01:04:27.129 --> 01:04:29.097
You know what
we have to do, Jules?

01:04:29.164 --> 01:04:31.462
We gotta work on the way
you're walking.

01:04:31.533 --> 01:04:35.196
You look a little stiff.
You ever see ''Frankenstein''?

01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:37.795
- l read the book.
- That's not gonna help.

01:04:37.873 --> 01:04:42.276
When you walk, you gotta walk
like you're moving to music,

01:04:42.344 --> 01:04:44.278
and l don't mean
a military march.

01:04:44.346 --> 01:04:47.247
Like, you know, Aretha Franklin
and Otis Redding...

01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:49.841
and Wilson Pickett,
a couple of white people.

01:04:49.918 --> 01:04:52.352
- Like this?
- Yeah. Bop! That's it.

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:55.254
- Yeah, loose!
- Oh, l like that.

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:58.384
l got something for you.
Try these on.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.759
- Sunglasses?
- Yeah, here you go.

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:07.234
Now, that's it.
There. Yeah!

01:05:07.302 --> 01:05:10.362
That's it. Yeah!

01:05:10.439 --> 01:05:12.373
- Whoops!
- Whoa!

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:16.537
- Do l look cool now?
- Mr. lce.

01:05:16.612 --> 01:05:19.672
Yeah, just breeze
on through. Yeah!

01:05:19.748 --> 01:05:23.377
Tonight

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:25.420
Tonight's the night

01:05:25.487 --> 01:05:27.955
lt's gonna be
a good night, bro

01:05:28.023 --> 01:05:30.856
And everything's gonna
happen, bro

01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:33.053
And you take her
in your arms

01:05:33.128 --> 01:05:35.790
And you plant a good
one on her... ho

01:05:35.864 --> 01:05:37.798
Tonight's the night

01:05:37.866 --> 01:05:39.800
Tonight, tonight, tonight

01:05:39.868 --> 01:05:41.802
Tonight is your night, bro

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:43.861
Tonight is your night, bro

01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:46.772
Tonight is your night, bro

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:49.310
Yeah, it's your night, bro!

01:05:49.378 --> 01:05:51.346
Oh yeah, bro
You're gonna do it

01:05:51.413 --> 01:05:53.438
You're gonna cut it

01:05:53.515 --> 01:05:55.745
You're making me nervous!

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:58.082
- Well, you're nervous.
- You've got to help me.

01:05:58.153 --> 01:06:00.212
- What?
- l've never been out on a date before.

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:02.450
- That's okay.
- l don't know what to do.

01:06:02.524 --> 01:06:05.982
Well, you talk to her.
You buy her a couple of drinks.

01:06:06.061 --> 01:06:07.995
You dance with her, bro

01:06:08.063 --> 01:06:11.794
You gonna dance with

01:06:11.867 --> 01:06:13.732
You dance?

01:06:17.806 --> 01:06:22.175
- Oh, you probably never
did that before, either.
- No.

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:24.178
Oh, well, look.

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:26.214
All right.

01:06:26.281 --> 01:06:29.250
The first thing is,
Jules,

01:06:29.318 --> 01:06:31.479
forget about disco.

01:06:31.553 --> 01:06:34.454
- Right? No disco.
- No disco.

01:06:34.523 --> 01:06:38.084
When l really wanna
romance a girl...

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.390
l waltz with her.

01:06:40.462 --> 01:06:43.989
Rah-tah-tah
Rah-tah-tah

01:06:44.066 --> 01:06:46.398
- You mean, like Strauss?
- Yeah.

01:06:46.468 --> 01:06:49.437
lt turns 'em into
putty in your hands.

01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:51.735
Rump-bump-bum
Diddilly-ump-bump

01:06:51.807 --> 01:06:56.039
Rump-bump-bum, Rump-bump-bum
Rump-bump-bum

01:06:56.111 --> 01:06:58.739
Come on, let's assume
the dance position.

01:06:58.814 --> 01:07:00.941
l'll give you
a couple of pointers.

01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:03.109
- l really appreciate that.
- Come on. Let's go.

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:05.380
l hope nobody's
looking in the window.

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:07.422
Come on, like this.
Here you go.

01:07:07.489 --> 01:07:11.152
Put your feet by my feet.
Come on. Let's go.

01:07:12.227 --> 01:07:14.821
By my feet...

01:07:14.897 --> 01:07:17.092
not on my feet.
Thanks very much.

01:07:17.165 --> 01:07:19.929
- Sorry, Vincent.
- Minor oversight.

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:22.163
Grab my hand.
Come on.

01:07:22.237 --> 01:07:25.502
Yeow! Ah! Ease up!

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:29.442
- Tiny bit. Let the blood
flow through the fingers.
- Oh, like loose?

01:07:29.511 --> 01:07:31.843
- See, come on. That's it, relax.
- l'm just nervous.

01:07:31.914 --> 01:07:35.213
Okay, one, two, three.
One, two, three.

01:07:35.284 --> 01:07:37.752
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

01:07:37.819 --> 01:07:39.787
- One, two, three.
- Don't, no.

01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:41.880
-One, two, three.
-See what you're doing with your teeth?

01:07:41.957 --> 01:07:44.949
You're grinding them.
Don't grind your teeth.

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:47.655
Don't grind your teeth.

01:07:47.729 --> 01:07:50.095
Relax your jaws, yeah.

01:07:50.165 --> 01:07:54.101
Now try to count without
moving your lips, all right?

01:07:54.169 --> 01:07:57.730
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

01:07:57.806 --> 01:08:00.366
See? That's it.
You're not wrestling a boar...

01:08:00.442 --> 01:08:03.775
300 miles south,
southwest of Fiji.

01:08:03.845 --> 01:08:09.477
lf l die for this dance

01:08:09.551 --> 01:08:11.712
Hold you and talk of

01:08:11.787 --> 01:08:14.847
Romance

01:08:14.923 --> 01:08:17.413
l've never been lucky

01:08:17.492 --> 01:08:21.656
l've got to take a chance

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:26.929
l'm caught up
in some kind of trance

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:32.029
And yes l would die
for this dance

01:08:34.943 --> 01:08:37.604
Where did you come from

01:08:37.679 --> 01:08:40.078
Out of nowhere it seems

01:08:40.148 --> 01:08:43.242
- May be an angel
- Good, Jules.

01:08:43.318 --> 01:08:46.344
Smiling on me

01:08:46.421 --> 01:08:48.389
l know it's crazy

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:51.051
You've taken my heart

01:08:51.126 --> 01:08:53.526
l'll never leave you

01:08:53.595 --> 01:08:55.825
You're my missing part

01:08:55.897 --> 01:09:00.890
Yes l'd die for this dance

01:09:00.969 --> 01:09:07.807
Hold you and
talk of romance

01:09:07.876 --> 01:09:13.746
l've never been lucky
l've got to take a chance

01:09:13.814 --> 01:09:16.943
Yeah!

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:20.716
l'm caught up in
some kind of trance

01:09:20.788 --> 01:09:26.921
Yes l would die
for this dance

01:09:44.645 --> 01:09:46.613
Way to go, Jules!

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:48.673
Ahhh!

01:09:51.019 --> 01:09:53.487
Did you know they had beer
in Ancient Egypt?

01:09:53.555 --> 01:09:55.546
- Oh, yeah?
- No.

01:09:55.624 --> 01:09:59.754
lt was actually the Assyrians
that developed the beer.

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:03.730
The Egyptians were the first
to perfect the malt process.

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:08.327
- You know a lot about beer.
- He knows about everything.

01:10:08.403 --> 01:10:11.133
lt's all from books.
Until tonight, l've never had a beer.

01:10:12.507 --> 01:10:16.307
All theory, no practice.
The story of my life.

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:20.974
- Awww!
- We're gonna change all that.

01:10:21.049 --> 01:10:22.983
Aren't we, Marnie?

01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:26.278
- Marnie.
- What?

01:10:26.354 --> 01:10:28.788
Am l shit-faced yet?

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:35.590
Excuse me, but...
my back teeth are floating.

01:10:37.799 --> 01:10:42.293
Excuse me, l have to check if
my back teeth are floating.

01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:44.270
Good shot.

01:10:47.275 --> 01:10:50.472
Woo-hoo! Ooo!

01:10:52.013 --> 01:10:56.814
Oh, God. We both flushed at
the same time before we did it.

01:10:58.553 --> 01:11:01.954
Yeah, right. Woo-hoo!

01:11:02.023 --> 01:11:05.083
Hey, Jules. Marnie's
got the hots for you, babe.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.151
Tonight is your lucky night.
l know it.

01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:11.222
- l don't think Marnie likes me.
- You kidding? Piece of cake.

01:11:11.299 --> 01:11:14.200
This woman is ripe.
You're nervous...

01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:16.669
because it's your first time.
Perfectly natural.

01:11:19.107 --> 01:11:21.041
Really.

01:11:24.479 --> 01:11:27.573
Were you nervous
the first time?

01:11:29.484 --> 01:11:33.215
l was 12 years old and she was
a nun. Talk about pressure.

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:36.757
Whoa!

01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:38.759
Come on, hit 'em.

01:11:38.827 --> 01:11:40.761
- What?
- Hit 'em, hit 'em.

01:11:40.829 --> 01:11:43.229
Oh, hit 'em,
hit 'em.

01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:45.323
Julius...

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:49.131
you know...

01:11:49.204 --> 01:11:52.867
Julius, l have
to admit this.

01:11:52.941 --> 01:11:56.172
Since you and l
first met, uh,

01:11:56.244 --> 01:11:58.576
my life has been just
getting better and better.

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:02.048
Mine, too.

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:04.051
l'm so happy, Vincent.

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:06.519
l feel like
sometimes, like...

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:09.022
- picking you up and hug you...
- Whoa!

01:12:09.090 --> 01:12:11.183
and hug you,
hug you, hug you.

01:12:14.563 --> 01:12:16.531
Hey, he's my brother.

01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:19.658
Oh, lay off
the beer, Julius.

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:32.505
Did you tell anyone
we were coming to Santa Fe?

01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:35.345
l called work and told them
we wouldn't be in for a few days.

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:39.714
Oh, l forgot to tell you
we were fired.

01:12:39.788 --> 01:12:43.053
- Oh, no.
- You hated that job.

01:12:43.124 --> 01:12:45.991
- Nice of your boss to tell us
where we could find you.
- Oh, no.

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:51.499
Hi, girls, you don't mind if
we join you and listen to some music.

01:12:53.134 --> 01:12:58.162
The Klane boys.
What an unpleasant surprise.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:01.767
Vince, this has
gone way beyond...

01:13:01.843 --> 01:13:05.127
- a case of simple loan delinquency.
- We don't like being shot.

01:13:05.261 --> 01:13:08.230
Shot? Who shot you?

01:13:08.297 --> 01:13:10.788
- What do you want?
- We want to take Vince...

01:13:10.866 --> 01:13:14.700
- out to the parking lot and kill him.
- Ohhh, owww!

01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:18.069
Don't you think
that's a little drastic?

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:19.869
Let's go.

01:13:19.942 --> 01:13:21.967
Don't touch him.

01:13:23.312 --> 01:13:25.143
Ohhh!

01:13:25.214 --> 01:13:27.944
Hey, big fella.

01:13:28.017 --> 01:13:30.485
You wouldn't want me to hurt
the lovely lady, would you?

01:13:30.553 --> 01:13:33.420
You moved too soon.

01:13:34.723 --> 01:13:38.625
- What?
- The second rule in a crisis:

01:13:38.694 --> 01:13:41.458
Uh-oh. He's startin'
that funny talk, again.

01:13:42.865 --> 01:13:44.924
lf you choose to bluff,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.059
you must be prepared
to have your bluff called.

01:13:47.136 --> 01:13:50.003
This is no bluff.

01:13:50.072 --> 01:13:52.540
These are my cousins,
Sam and Dave.

01:13:52.608 --> 01:13:54.872
Get these jerks
outta here.

01:14:09.458 --> 01:14:13.394
l'm so proud of you.
l love when you hit people.

01:14:15.164 --> 01:14:17.655
You got a lot
of rules, Jules.

01:14:26.308 --> 01:14:28.401
What a day.

01:14:28.477 --> 01:14:32.072
First we visited
our birthplace,

01:14:32.147 --> 01:14:34.206
then we bought
new clothes.

01:14:34.283 --> 01:14:38.014
l got a bucket of ice and
a very good bottle of wine.

01:14:38.087 --> 01:14:41.614
- Then we danced the waltz.
- Yes, we did.

01:14:41.690 --> 01:14:44.853
- lt's too bright.
- Then we got into a fight.

01:14:44.927 --> 01:14:48.920
- We have this beautiful room.
- Perfect. Yes, it is beautiful.

01:14:48.998 --> 01:14:51.262
Life just doesn't
get better than this.

01:14:51.333 --> 01:14:55.429
- Oh, yes, it does. Good night.
- Where are you going?

01:14:55.504 --> 01:14:59.031
l'm gonna go tuck Linda in
and maybe read her a bedtime story.

01:14:59.108 --> 01:15:02.271
Don't wait up for me.

01:15:02.344 --> 01:15:07.680
Tonight is your night, bro

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:09.684
lt's your night, bro

01:15:13.322 --> 01:15:15.290
Oh, Vincent, you locked
yourself out.

01:15:15.357 --> 01:15:17.484
l--

01:15:17.559 --> 01:15:19.720
- Marnie.
- Hi.

01:15:19.795 --> 01:15:21.729
- Hi.
- Vince and Linda wanna be alone,

01:15:21.797 --> 01:15:25.062
so l'm afraid l'm gonna
have to stay here tonight.

01:15:25.134 --> 01:15:29.503
- You mean you're gonna
sleep here tonight?
- Uh-huh.

01:15:29.571 --> 01:15:32.563
Which bed should l take?

01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:37.310
Either bed will be fine.

01:15:37.379 --> 01:15:39.313
l always sleep
on the floo--

01:15:48.824 --> 01:15:52.385
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:08.801
Julius.

01:16:12.147 --> 01:16:15.810
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:16:32.067 --> 01:16:34.865
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:16:36.238 --> 01:16:39.969
- What's the matter?
- This bed is lumpy.

01:16:45.447 --> 01:16:48.678
You mind if l share
the floor with you?

01:17:16.145 --> 01:17:19.842
You're teasing me,
aren't you?

01:17:19.915 --> 01:17:22.349
A little.

01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:29.223
What do l do now?

01:17:32.327 --> 01:17:34.318
We'll figure it out.

01:17:37.266 --> 01:17:40.326
- Oh, Vince.
- Tonight is our night, bro

01:17:40.402 --> 01:17:43.303
Why are you
doing that now?

01:17:43.372 --> 01:17:45.306
Mom hasn't seen me
in all these years.

01:17:45.374 --> 01:17:47.740
l wanna look my best.

01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:51.007
- Tonight
- Your mom's gonna love you
whatever you look like.

01:17:51.079 --> 01:17:53.047
And you look
really good.

01:17:53.115 --> 01:17:55.515
l know, l know,
l know, l know.

01:17:55.584 --> 01:17:59.748
So like this.
One, two, three.

01:17:59.822 --> 01:18:01.756
Are you a little nervous?

01:18:01.824 --> 01:18:03.758
27, 28, no, 29.

01:18:03.826 --> 01:18:05.726
- Just a little.
- Nine, ten.

01:18:06.461 --> 01:18:08.395
- Linda.
- What?

01:18:08.463 --> 01:18:12.456
Like, what if she's
disappointed in me?

01:18:12.534 --> 01:18:15.367
lf she's disappointed,
then she's a fake.

01:18:15.437 --> 01:18:18.702
l don't know what else
a mom could want in a son.

01:18:18.774 --> 01:18:21.766
- Huh?
- You're right.

01:18:21.844 --> 01:18:24.779
You're right, you're right.
Why am l worried?

01:18:24.847 --> 01:18:26.781
- What am l worried about?
- l don't know.

01:18:26.849 --> 01:18:28.817
You got it all.

01:18:28.884 --> 01:18:34.447
- l couldn't do this without you, Linda.
- Yeah.

01:18:34.523 --> 01:18:37.287
You know,
l've been thinking...

01:18:37.359 --> 01:18:40.851
- that when we get back...
- Yeah?

01:18:40.929 --> 01:18:43.193
l think we should
move in together.

01:18:43.265 --> 01:18:45.199
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

01:18:45.267 --> 01:18:47.633
- Oh, no, no.
- lt's not ''Oh, no.''

01:18:47.703 --> 01:18:49.694
- lt's not no, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:18:49.771 --> 01:18:52.035
l don't want to get married
and it's not that l wanna...

01:18:52.107 --> 01:18:54.598
keep track of you,
because l don't need to.

01:18:54.676 --> 01:18:58.077
l just wanna
live with you.

01:18:58.146 --> 01:19:00.706
lt'd be fun.

01:19:00.782 --> 01:19:03.842
Linda, look at me.

01:19:03.919 --> 01:19:05.944
Do l look like somebody
who could play house?

01:19:06.021 --> 01:19:09.047
l'm cranky in the morning,
l'm grouchy in the afternoon,

01:19:09.124 --> 01:19:11.558
l'm moody at night,
l'm like miserable.

01:19:11.627 --> 01:19:13.993
l know what
you're like.

01:19:14.062 --> 01:19:18.158
Let's sleep on it, okay?
Sleep on it.

01:19:18.233 --> 01:19:20.667
- Okay, one night.
- This is going to be great.

01:19:20.736 --> 01:19:24.502
Tomorrow l'm taking my best girl
to meet my mom. l'm so excited.

01:19:24.573 --> 01:19:28.202
- Your best girl?
- Yeah, you, you.

01:19:28.277 --> 01:19:31.735
- Linda, there's no other girls.
Not anymore.
- Yeah?

01:19:31.813 --> 01:19:36.113
- Just you.
- There better not be. Know why?

01:19:36.184 --> 01:19:41.520
- Why?
- 'Cause l only have eyes for you

01:19:45.827 --> 01:19:47.795
- That sounds familiar.
- lt's a good song.

01:19:47.863 --> 01:19:49.797
You like that song, huh?

01:19:49.865 --> 01:19:54.859
And l only have eyes

01:19:54.937 --> 01:20:01.968
For you
she-bop she-bop

01:20:02.044 --> 01:20:04.012
She-bop she-bop

01:20:06.381 --> 01:20:07.939
She-bop she-bop

01:20:08.016 --> 01:20:14.888
l only have eyes for you
She-bop she-bop

01:20:14.957 --> 01:20:16.058
She-bop she-bop

01:20:16.058 --> 01:20:18.618
She-bop she-bop

01:20:18.694 --> 01:20:21.788
Just for you
She-bop she-bop

01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:37.076
Oh, it's huge.

01:20:37.145 --> 01:20:39.079
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:20:39.147 --> 01:20:41.081
Not to mention valuable.

01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:43.583
Real estate like this
is worth a fortune.

01:20:43.652 --> 01:20:45.620
You mustn't always
think about money.

01:20:45.687 --> 01:20:47.917
You got me all wrong,
Julius.

01:20:49.558 --> 01:20:52.584
l'm just saying
it's nice Mom's loaded.

01:20:52.661 --> 01:20:56.097
That's a worry she won't
have to have in her old age.

01:20:56.164 --> 01:20:57.961
Hello,
can l help you?

01:20:58.033 --> 01:21:00.900
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, um, excuse me.

01:21:00.969 --> 01:21:02.800
We are looking for
Mary Ann Benedict, please.

01:21:02.871 --> 01:21:05.396
l'm sorry, but
that's not possible.

01:21:05.474 --> 01:21:07.738
Look, we've
come a long way.

01:21:07.809 --> 01:21:11.768
And believe me, she's gonna
be very happy to see us.

01:21:11.847 --> 01:21:16.011
You're gonna have to
write to the Benedict Foundation
stating your business.

01:21:16.084 --> 01:21:18.109
l'm sorry. Good day.

01:21:22.791 --> 01:21:27.057
- Foundation?
- Millions, Julius.

01:21:27.129 --> 01:21:29.063
Mama's rich.
We gotta go see her.

01:21:29.131 --> 01:21:30.655
Buckaroos.

01:21:30.732 --> 01:21:33.200
- Let's get in there.
We gotta talk to her.
- We sneak in.

01:21:33.268 --> 01:21:35.702
- How is it?
- Yeah, it's clear. Throw me over.

01:21:35.771 --> 01:21:37.762
Okay.

01:21:41.009 --> 01:21:43.910
Vince?
Vince, are you okay?

01:21:43.979 --> 01:21:45.947
Yeah, shut up.
Come on, come on.

01:22:09.704 --> 01:22:11.672
What a lovely day.

01:22:15.577 --> 01:22:19.877
Hey, Vincent, don't you
think this is Mama?

01:22:19.948 --> 01:22:24.408
lt could be. Yeah.

01:22:24.486 --> 01:22:27.785
Don't just stand there.
Go introduce yourselves.

01:22:27.856 --> 01:22:29.084
Hey!

01:22:29.157 --> 01:22:32.684
- Should you people be here?
- Uh-oh.

01:22:32.761 --> 01:22:36.697
That depends on how you feel
personally about trespassing.

01:22:36.765 --> 01:22:39.359
Does he always try
to be funny like that?

01:22:39.434 --> 01:22:43.427
- We're looking for
Miss Mary Ann Benedict.
- Yeah.

01:22:43.505 --> 01:22:46.941
- ls she here?
- Yeah, she's here.

01:22:47.008 --> 01:22:49.533
She's here!

01:22:49.611 --> 01:22:52.375
Sneaking in like that,
l should call the police.

01:22:52.447 --> 01:22:54.711
No, no, no. You don't want
to do anything like that.

01:22:54.783 --> 01:22:59.243
This is not your everyday,
average situation.

01:23:07.162 --> 01:23:09.596
She's our mother,
is the thing.

01:23:09.664 --> 01:23:12.224
- We're her sons.
- Twin sons.

01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:17.534
You're comedians.

01:23:17.606 --> 01:23:20.074
- No.
- No. We--

01:23:20.142 --> 01:23:22.372
We're kind of a surprise.

01:23:22.444 --> 01:23:26.380
l'll bet you are.
Follow me.

01:23:32.154 --> 01:23:35.248
- We were right.
- lt is her.

01:23:42.230 --> 01:23:44.289
Excuse me.

01:23:46.034 --> 01:23:48.161
- We thought that this is--
- Mary Ann Benedict?

01:23:48.236 --> 01:23:51.205
This is an artists' colony.
There are a lot of painters.

01:23:51.273 --> 01:23:54.936
Come on.

01:23:56.411 --> 01:23:58.811
l can't wait to meet her.

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:00.973
- Yeah.
- lt's gotta be amazing.

01:24:01.049 --> 01:24:04.018
Look. Mary Ann Benedict
never understood...

01:24:04.085 --> 01:24:06.781
why people wanted
to buy her paintings.

01:24:06.855 --> 01:24:09.847
But for a brief period,
they were considered valuable.

01:24:09.925 --> 01:24:13.326
She used the money
to buy Whispering Pines.

01:24:15.297 --> 01:24:17.492
May l ask you a question?

01:24:17.566 --> 01:24:21.559
Why do you keep referring
to her in the past tense?

01:24:21.636 --> 01:24:24.469
Because...

01:24:24.539 --> 01:24:26.939
she passed away
some time ago.

01:24:28.710 --> 01:24:31.144
She passed--

01:24:31.213 --> 01:24:34.478
You jus-- You just said
she was here.

01:24:34.549 --> 01:24:38.952
l meant, her spirit.
Her spirit is always here.

01:24:42.624 --> 01:24:44.182
Come on.

01:25:09.251 --> 01:25:12.778
Can we get the hell
out of here, please?

01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:18.054
Those damn real estate developers!

01:25:18.126 --> 01:25:21.584
They won't be happy until
they turn this into a golf course.

01:25:21.663 --> 01:25:24.257
Oh, is that
who they were?

01:25:24.332 --> 01:25:27.165
They're shameless.
They'll try anything.

01:25:29.137 --> 01:25:32.937
Do you know those men claim
to be my twin sons?

01:25:33.008 --> 01:25:35.238
- lf you can believe that!
- What?

01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:38.006
lt was really
quite upsetting.

01:25:38.079 --> 01:25:40.343
Mary Ann, l am sorry.

01:25:40.415 --> 01:25:42.679
lt's all right.
lt doesn't matter.

01:25:42.751 --> 01:25:44.981
You get over things.

01:25:47.188 --> 01:25:49.748
l did have a child once.

01:25:49.824 --> 01:25:52.691
But he died at birth.

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:01.233
You should be proud of her.

01:26:01.303 --> 01:26:03.533
She donates her house, land,

01:26:03.605 --> 01:26:06.005
and all her paintings
to young artists.

01:26:06.074 --> 01:26:09.100
Linda, do l look like
a young artist?

01:26:09.177 --> 01:26:12.374
- All she meant--
- l know what she meant,
and why she's here.

01:26:12.447 --> 01:26:14.938
lt's got nothing to do
with finding my mother,

01:26:15.016 --> 01:26:17.109
and everything
to do with money.

01:26:17.185 --> 01:26:21.121
- That's not true and you know it.
- Bullshit!

01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:22.859
Take it easy, Vincent.
This is not her fault.

01:26:22.859 --> 01:26:24.190
Take it easy, Vincent.
This is not her fault.

01:26:24.261 --> 01:26:27.094
Look who decided
to chime in!

01:26:27.163 --> 01:26:29.097
The creature from
the Black Lagoon.

01:26:29.165 --> 01:26:31.429
l should've had my head
examined listening to you.

01:26:31.501 --> 01:26:33.526
A deal-of-a-lifetime
opportunity,

01:26:33.603 --> 01:26:36.333
and l'm out looking
for a dead mother.

01:26:36.406 --> 01:26:39.398
- All l wanted was to
make us into a family.
- Family, my butt!

01:26:39.476 --> 01:26:41.706
There's no family here.

01:26:41.778 --> 01:26:44.679
There's nothin' here
except me and three losers.

01:26:44.748 --> 01:26:46.909
l don't know
why l listen to people.

01:26:46.983 --> 01:26:49.349
- l don't know why l do it.
- Cut it out.

01:26:49.419 --> 01:26:51.387
Vince!

01:26:51.454 --> 01:26:53.388
- l'm leaving.
- No, stop!

01:26:53.456 --> 01:26:55.549
Stop! What are you doing?

01:26:55.625 --> 01:26:58.321
You're acting
like a fourth-grader.

01:26:58.395 --> 01:27:01.489
Where do you think
you're going?

01:27:01.564 --> 01:27:04.863
He dumped us in
the middle of New Mexico.

01:27:04.934 --> 01:27:07.232
l can't--

01:27:07.304 --> 01:27:09.238
Julius!

01:27:09.306 --> 01:27:11.740
You don't know this,

01:27:11.808 --> 01:27:14.606
and l promised Vince
that l wouldn't tell you,

01:27:14.678 --> 01:27:18.478
but he's got something in
the trunk that's worth millions.

01:27:18.548 --> 01:27:23.315
l'm worried he's gonna get
himself killed delivering it.

01:27:27.724 --> 01:27:30.386
Okay, yeah. Yes, Mr. Beetroot.

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:34.954
Yeah, l'll find it. Yeah.

01:27:35.031 --> 01:27:36.999
Yes, l have a map.

01:27:37.067 --> 01:27:39.228
All right.
l'll see you there.

01:27:39.302 --> 01:27:41.463
See you in Houston
in the morning.

01:27:41.538 --> 01:27:44.063
l'll be looking
forward to it.

01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:46.734
What a coincidence.

01:27:46.810 --> 01:27:48.778
That was our friend.

01:27:48.845 --> 01:27:52.178
Looks like l'm gonna be
doing business with... him.

01:27:52.248 --> 01:27:53.613
Sorry.

01:27:53.683 --> 01:27:56.015
l would have done
the same thing.

01:27:56.086 --> 01:27:59.522
You want the merchandise.
lt's not your problem who delivers.

01:27:59.589 --> 01:28:01.454
Precisely.

01:28:07.063 --> 01:28:09.827
But how will
you find him?

01:28:09.899 --> 01:28:11.833
l have him in my head.

01:28:11.901 --> 01:28:15.667
l found him once,
l'll find him again.

01:28:15.739 --> 01:28:18.071
l hope so. Bye.

01:28:18.141 --> 01:28:20.439
Be careful.

01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:22.944
Brother to brother

01:28:25.648 --> 01:28:27.775
Brother to brother

01:28:30.854 --> 01:28:32.845
One to another

01:28:32.922 --> 01:28:35.891
Like no other

01:28:35.959 --> 01:28:40.089
Brother to brother
Brother to brother

01:28:40.163 --> 01:28:42.859
Never knew you existed

01:28:42.932 --> 01:28:45.196
Never saw you
in my dreams

01:28:45.268 --> 01:28:47.532
lf there were signs
l must've missed 'em

01:28:47.604 --> 01:28:50.072
Who would l believe

01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:52.472
Now all of a sudden

01:28:52.542 --> 01:28:54.635
We're sharing this skin

01:28:54.711 --> 01:28:57.236
Like a shadow
you stick to me

01:28:57.313 --> 01:28:59.781
Through every jam l'm in

01:28:59.849 --> 01:29:02.443
Brother to brother

01:29:02.519 --> 01:29:06.546
You took me by the hand
brother to brother

01:29:06.623 --> 01:29:10.423
You helped me understand
one to another

01:29:10.493 --> 01:29:13.656
There'll never be another
No, no

01:29:13.730 --> 01:29:16.028
Brother to brother
my brother

01:29:16.099 --> 01:29:18.795
Brother to brother
my brother

01:29:18.868 --> 01:29:23.896
When l felt like a zero

01:29:25.175 --> 01:29:28.440
You became my hero

01:29:28.511 --> 01:29:30.945
One to another

01:29:31.014 --> 01:29:34.177
You have been my brother

01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:38.016
My brother
Whoa

01:29:38.087 --> 01:29:39.255
Brother to brother

01:29:39.255 --> 01:29:40.279
Brother to brother

01:29:40.356 --> 01:29:43.792
When l was up
against the wall

01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:46.488
About to take
a really big fall

01:29:57.707 --> 01:29:59.641
Sorry l'm late.

01:29:59.709 --> 01:30:02.701
- The directions you gave me weren't--
- Step back.

01:30:06.583 --> 01:30:09.143
Get over here.

01:30:09.219 --> 01:30:11.915
l'm unarmed.

01:30:11.988 --> 01:30:14.081
He's clean.

01:30:14.157 --> 01:30:17.524
Oh, oh.
lsn't that pretty!

01:30:17.594 --> 01:30:19.528
Yeah, it is.

01:30:19.596 --> 01:30:22.861
- Did you come here alone, unarmed?
- Yeah.

01:30:22.932 --> 01:30:24.991
You're just some fool
who stole a car?

01:30:25.068 --> 01:30:28.663
Yeah, l guess l am.

01:30:28.738 --> 01:30:31.639
You don't know what
the hell this is, do you?

01:30:31.708 --> 01:30:34.700
No.

01:30:34.777 --> 01:30:38.406
Revolutionary fuel-injection
system for jets.

01:30:38.481 --> 01:30:41.416
Worth a fortune to the company that
brings it to the market first.

01:30:41.484 --> 01:30:45.750
Somebody else developed it,
but l just had to have it.

01:30:45.822 --> 01:30:48.290
Crafty devil, huh?

01:30:49.158 --> 01:30:51.422
What are you waiting for?

01:30:52.695 --> 01:30:54.686
Wait a minute, Beetroot!

01:30:54.764 --> 01:30:57.494
- l thought we had a deal.
- We do.

01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:09.237
Five million bucks!

01:31:09.312 --> 01:31:12.406
- You wanna count it?
- No, no.

01:31:12.482 --> 01:31:17.215
- But l could use a lift to town.
- Don't press your luck.

01:31:17.287 --> 01:31:19.221
Okay. That's all right.

01:31:19.289 --> 01:31:23.157
l gassed it up for you,
Beetroot. Thank you!

01:31:23.226 --> 01:31:28.289
Five million dollars!
Five million bucks!

01:31:28.364 --> 01:31:31.663
Ha-ha-ha!
Five million bucks!

01:31:31.734 --> 01:31:34.362
l've gotta look at it!

01:31:36.039 --> 01:31:38.633
Uh-oh.

01:32:18.982 --> 01:32:21.246
Hey, Benedict!

01:32:21.317 --> 01:32:24.218
All l want is the money.

01:32:24.287 --> 01:32:28.223
Just give me what's mine
and l'll leave you alone.

01:33:05.161 --> 01:33:07.493
Steps! Steps!

01:33:18.875 --> 01:33:21.366
Leave my brother alone.

01:33:22.512 --> 01:33:25.106
No.

01:33:25.181 --> 01:33:27.115
You.

01:33:27.183 --> 01:33:30.380
No, no, no.

01:33:30.453 --> 01:33:33.320
No, no.

01:33:36.125 --> 01:33:39.526
Julius, you're--
you're here?

01:33:39.595 --> 01:33:42.086
No. No, you idiot.

01:33:42.165 --> 01:33:44.360
Don't be nervous.

01:33:44.434 --> 01:33:47.835
l hate violence.
Plus l never carry a gun.

01:33:47.904 --> 01:33:50.498
Who are you?

01:33:50.573 --> 01:33:52.564
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:33:52.642 --> 01:33:54.667
Put the gun down.
l got the money.

01:33:54.744 --> 01:33:57.542
Here's your money.
Here's your money.

01:33:57.613 --> 01:34:00.776
Here's the money.

01:34:00.850 --> 01:34:03.318
You're a goddamned millionaire.

01:34:04.654 --> 01:34:09.387
You, l am never
gonna forgive... never.

01:34:09.459 --> 01:34:13.088
- Open it.
- Open it?

01:34:13.162 --> 01:34:16.654
You were going
to get killed.

01:34:16.733 --> 01:34:20.430
- l was trying to distract him
so you could escape.
- l already had escaped!

01:34:20.503 --> 01:34:24.030
l was halfway to Brazil
when l felt you!

01:34:24.107 --> 01:34:27.304
- Close it.
- Close it?

01:34:27.376 --> 01:34:29.503
Open it, close it.
Open it, close it.

01:34:29.579 --> 01:34:33.310
- Why didn't you go?
- Why didn't l go?

01:34:33.382 --> 01:34:37.182
Because thanks to you,
l'm not only a goddamned psychic--

01:34:37.253 --> 01:34:38.743
Benedict!

01:34:38.821 --> 01:34:41.415
- l think the case belongs to me.
- Oh, sorry.

01:34:41.491 --> 01:34:45.621
l got this disease
called a conscience.

01:34:45.695 --> 01:34:49.358
- No one ever said being good was easy.
- ''No one ever said--''

01:34:49.432 --> 01:34:50.956
Will you two shut up!

01:34:51.033 --> 01:34:53.831
Butt out, pal!
You got your money.

01:34:53.903 --> 01:34:56.929
Now take it and go live in
the lap of luxury somewhere.

01:34:57.006 --> 01:34:59.236
Try Brazil.

01:34:59.308 --> 01:35:02.709
lt doesn't work that way.
You've seen my face.

01:35:02.779 --> 01:35:04.974
Which one's first?

01:35:05.047 --> 01:35:08.915
You gonna kill us, even though
we gave you the money?

01:35:08.985 --> 01:35:10.282
You got it.

01:35:10.353 --> 01:35:14.084
Wait, you forgot the third rule
in a crisis situation.

01:35:14.157 --> 01:35:17.558
- The third rule?
- Third rule?

01:35:17.627 --> 01:35:20.562
Yeah, third rule.

01:35:24.667 --> 01:35:26.567
Oooh!

01:35:26.636 --> 01:35:29.901
- The third rule.
- What's the third rule?

01:35:29.972 --> 01:35:31.564
Duck!

01:36:01.537 --> 01:36:03.835
Yo!

01:36:03.906 --> 01:36:06.898
Holy-shmoly!

01:36:12.281 --> 01:36:15.375
Now there's a man
with a lot on his mind.

01:36:18.387 --> 01:36:21.083
Thanks for coming back,
Vincent.

01:36:21.157 --> 01:36:24.092
We're brothers, right?

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:26.424
- We're family.
- That's right.

01:36:29.298 --> 01:36:31.789
A rich family.

01:36:31.868 --> 01:36:34.302
- A good family.
- What? What?

01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:36.964
- We're gonna return this money.
- No.

01:36:37.039 --> 01:36:39.234
- We don't have to give it back.
- Yes, we do.

01:36:39.308 --> 01:36:41.367
- Why? Why?
- We have to, believe me.

01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:47.943
- Mary Ann?
- Hmm?

01:36:48.017 --> 01:36:51.180
l think you'd better come
take a look at this.

01:36:51.254 --> 01:36:54.553
What is it?

01:37:21.050 --> 01:37:22.608
Mary Ann?

01:37:22.685 --> 01:37:26.815
What a pleasant surprise.

01:37:29.358 --> 01:37:32.384
You stole my family.

01:37:32.461 --> 01:37:35.589
You lying son of a bitch.

01:37:41.370 --> 01:37:43.804
Linda, l'm sorry.

01:37:43.873 --> 01:37:46.467
l made a terrible mistake
and l apologize.

01:37:46.542 --> 01:37:49.272
l-- All l'm asking for
is another chance.

01:37:49.345 --> 01:37:51.336
l know l don't
deserve this--

01:37:51.414 --> 01:37:53.575
That's right,
you don't deserve it.

01:38:08.864 --> 01:38:10.889
Vince?

01:38:24.976 --> 01:38:28.537
Yes, this is the
Benedict Corporation.

01:38:28.613 --> 01:38:31.810
We are a consulting firm...
a think tank.

01:38:31.882 --> 01:38:35.113
Something like
the Rand Corporation.

01:38:35.186 --> 01:38:37.711
- Only smarter.
- Only smarter.

01:38:37.788 --> 01:38:39.813
Tomorrow at 3:00.

01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:43.291
Yes, l'll put you down.

01:38:43.361 --> 01:38:45.352
Good night, Mr. Benedicts.

01:38:45.429 --> 01:38:47.420
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:38:47.498 --> 01:38:51.332
That's it.
The last check is written.

01:38:51.402 --> 01:38:54.667
What do we have left out of
the $50,000 reward?

01:38:54.739 --> 01:38:57.731
After we've paid off
all our debts,

01:38:57.808 --> 01:39:00.675
we have exactly $12,278.

01:39:00.745 --> 01:39:04.545
- $12,278. That's terrible.
- What?

01:39:04.615 --> 01:39:07.550
You're just upset because
l made you return that suitcase.

01:39:10.454 --> 01:39:13.981
Oh, the money.

01:39:14.058 --> 01:39:16.492
You mean the
four million dollars.

01:39:17.762 --> 01:39:20.162
Four million dollars.
Just say it.

01:39:20.231 --> 01:39:23.496
Say it...
four million dollars.

01:39:23.567 --> 01:39:26.161
lt's a lot of money,
Jules.

01:39:26.237 --> 01:39:29.502
Vincent...
l'm very proud of you.

01:39:29.573 --> 01:39:33.407
Well...

01:39:33.477 --> 01:39:37.174
yeah, l'm kinda
proud of myself.

01:39:37.248 --> 01:39:40.649
lsn't it great to be one of
the good guys for a change?

01:39:40.718 --> 01:39:43.812
lt feels great
to be a good guy!

01:39:43.888 --> 01:39:47.051
You're a great guy, too.
You came back for me, huh?

01:39:47.124 --> 01:39:50.321
- You did steal a car though.
- l borrowed one.

01:39:50.394 --> 01:39:53.795
l brought it back the next day.
l explained it to the man.

01:39:53.864 --> 01:39:55.661
He was a cowboy.

01:39:55.733 --> 01:39:58.759
Excuse me? l'm--

01:39:58.836 --> 01:40:02.567
Oh, my God. l don't even know
which one is which.

01:40:07.044 --> 01:40:09.239
l'm sorry.
l didn't know.

01:40:09.313 --> 01:40:12.612
You see, l didn't
believe your story.

01:40:12.683 --> 01:40:15.709
Who would believe
a crazy story like that?

01:40:19.690 --> 01:40:22.284
They lied to me
all these years.

01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:25.454
They lied to you, too.

01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:35.701
You found each other.

01:40:42.213 --> 01:40:44.443
Now you found me.

01:41:03.968 --> 01:41:05.936
Mama?

01:41:07.605 --> 01:41:08.867
Mama!

01:41:10.975 --> 01:41:12.499
Mama!

01:41:12.576 --> 01:41:14.908
Oh, Mama!

01:41:33.197 --> 01:41:35.529
Good.

01:41:35.599 --> 01:41:37.863
Tickets?

01:41:37.935 --> 01:41:39.869
Thanks. This is
gonna be great.

01:41:39.937 --> 01:41:42.770
l just can't get over
how alike they are.

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:45.968
Yes, it's a beautiful day.

01:42:17.808 --> 01:42:21.869
Twins united outside and in

01:42:21.946 --> 01:42:23.880
Mm-mm, Uh-huh

01:42:24.815 --> 01:42:26.840
When you're twins

01:42:26.917 --> 01:42:30.080
The magic just never ends

01:42:32.356 --> 01:42:35.917
What happened to you
Hey, l could feel it

01:42:35.993 --> 01:42:39.554
l smile and l cry
without knowing why

01:42:39.630 --> 01:42:43.191
Your joy and your pain
would be so real

01:42:43.267 --> 01:42:47.294
l felt like my life
was happenin' again

01:42:47.371 --> 01:42:50.966
And now l know it's
'cause you're part of me

01:42:51.041 --> 01:42:54.568
Wasn't my choice
it was meant to be

01:42:54.645 --> 01:42:58.274
We were connected
even when apart

01:42:58.349 --> 01:43:01.876
We got together
now the real problems start

01:43:01.952 --> 01:43:05.820
Twins
united outside and in

01:43:05.890 --> 01:43:08.290
Yeah

01:43:08.359 --> 01:43:10.691
When you're twins

01:43:10.761 --> 01:43:13.594
The magic just never ends

01:43:17.902 --> 01:43:21.497
lf one me is good
then two is better

01:43:21.572 --> 01:43:25.338
Well, l can't complain
'cause l'm ahead of the game

01:43:25.409 --> 01:43:28.936
We split the pain
double the pleasure

01:43:29.013 --> 01:43:32.574
l'm starting to feel
life gave us a deal

01:43:32.650 --> 01:43:36.586
No, we're not just
your average family

01:43:36.654 --> 01:43:40.283
Got benefits
most people never see

01:43:40.357 --> 01:43:43.884
And if l had a chance
to live again

01:43:43.961 --> 01:43:47.226
l wouldn't want it
unless l was your twin

01:43:47.298 --> 01:43:52.065
Twins
united outside and in

01:43:52.136 --> 01:43:54.036
Ah, yeah

01:43:54.104 --> 01:43:56.299
When you're twins

01:43:56.373 --> 01:43:59.365
The magic just never ends

01:43:59.443 --> 01:44:01.673
Ah, yeah

01:44:01.745 --> 01:44:06.307
Twins
united outside and in

01:44:06.383 --> 01:44:07.748
Mm-mm, Uh-huh

01:44:08.619 --> 01:44:10.951
When you're twins

01:44:11.021 --> 01:44:14.081
The magic just never ends

01:44:16.293 --> 01:44:19.751
Twins

01:44:38.315 --> 01:44:40.078
Twins

01:44:41.305 --> 01:44:47.547
