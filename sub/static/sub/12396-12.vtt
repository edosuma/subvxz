00:21.080 --> 00:22.741
[laughs]

00:39.770 --> 00:41.067
HAVE I GOT THAT RIGHT?
HAVE I GOT IT RIGHT?

00:41.100 --> 00:42.636

IT'S LIKE A 200 IN HERE.
[laughter]

01:02.860 --> 01:07.752
EXCEPT FOR VEGETABLES.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.724
- EH, IT'S ALWAYS A BIT
OF A DICE ROLL WITH VENISON.

01:10.770 --> 01:13.136
- WELL, NOT TODAY. IT WAS AN
ABSOLUTELY LOVELY MEAL, HENRY.

01:13.170 --> 01:14.865
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- OH, PLEASE.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.698
IT'S BEEN AGES SINCE I'VE
BEEN ABLE TO GRILL FOR ANYONE.

01:17.740 --> 01:19.833
SHAWN DOESN'T COME AROUND MUCH
THESE DAYS.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.542
- NOPE,
NOT SINCE THE INCIDENT.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.207
- MORE THAN FAIR.
- LOOK, SHAWN.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.478
WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOUR MOTHER AND I

01:25.510 --> 01:27.444
THAT NIGHT
WAS COMPLETELY NATURAL

01:27.480 --> 01:29.880
AND ARABESQUE.
- OH, GOD.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.615
- SHAWN, YOU SAW
YOUR PARENTS SHAGGING?

01:31.650 --> 01:33.151

NO!

01:36.890 --> 01:38.426

NOT READY TO TALK ABOUT IT.

01:38.460 --> 01:40.223
- WHOA, LOOK AT THAT,
[clears throat]

01:40.260 --> 01:41.329
IT'S TIME
FOR THE CROCK POT.

01:41.360 --> 01:42.759

01:47.840 --> 01:49.398
HE'S LIKE
THE HOWARD STERN OF RADIO.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.908
- THAT DOESN'T EVEN
MAKE ANY SENSE.

01:51.940 --> 01:53.476
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GUYS LIKE HIM.

01:53.510 --> 01:54.772
HE HAS THE MENTALITY
OF A FIVE-YEAR-OLD.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.870
- OH, COME ON, JULES.
HE HAD US ON HIS SHOW.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.377
- TO MAKE FUN OF YOU.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.910
- HE WAS LAUGHING
WITH US, JULES,

02:00.950 --> 02:02.486
AND YOU KNOW,
HE'S MATURED SINCE THEN.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.511
HE TACKLES THE REAL ISSUES
ON AIR THE NOW.

02:04.550 --> 02:06.359
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- PROCTOLOGY IS WITCHCRAFI'.

02:06.390 --> 02:07.687

WITH THE CROCK POT.

02:11.890 --> 02:13.448
WHAT SEEMINGLY IMPORTANT ISSUE
DO YOU HAVE THAT YOU WANT...

02:13.500 --> 02:15.195
- BE CAREFUL.
- IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.

02:15.230 --> 02:16.663
- TO SHARE WITH THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE

02:16.700 --> 02:18.497
WHO WILL IMMEDIATELY
JUDGE AND BERATE YOU?

02:18.530 --> 02:20.566
TIME FOR THE CROCK TO PUT
A BIT OF MONEY IN THE BANK,

02:20.600 --> 02:23.205
SO STAY PUT.
YOU KNOW I WANT YOU TO THINK,

02:23.240 --> 02:26.175
BUT JUST DON'T THINK
ABOUT TOUCHING THAT DIAL.

02:26.210 --> 02:29.441
THIS IS THE CROCK POT.

02:29.480 --> 02:32.711

- WOW, SO YOU'RE GOING TO LONDON
FOR SIX MONTHS?

02:38.690 --> 02:42.456
- IT'S MY TEMPORARY VISA,
IT'S A NIGHTMARE SITUATION.

02:42.490 --> 02:44.185
IT WOULDN'T BE SO TERRIBLE
IF I HADN'T MET BURTON.

02:44.230 --> 02:46.926
- MM,
HOW IS HE TAKING IT?

02:46.960 --> 02:49.827
[clicks tongue]
OH, YOU HAVEN'T TOLD HIM.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.895
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO BREAK IT TO HIM.

02:51.930 --> 02:53.795
HE CRIES
AT THE DROP OF A HAT.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.364
- UGH.

03:07.250 --> 03:08.217
[gunshots]

03:08.250 --> 03:12.584
- WAS THAT A GUNSHOT?

03:12.620 --> 03:14.258
- IT'S GO'ITA BE
SOME KIND OF A JOKE.

03:14.290 --> 03:16.986
- YEAH, IT'S GO'I'I'A BE.
IT'S CROCK, RIGHT?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.588
HE'S UP TO HINSOOLD TRICKS.

03:18.630 --> 03:24.865
NO,
IT WAS A GUNSHOT.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.936
- SOMEBODY
SHOT THE CROCK POT?

[indistinct chatter]

03:57.970 --> 04:01.690

FOR THE CROCKER, GUS.

04:01.740 --> 04:04.834
OH, HEAVENLY BEARDED FATHER
OF THE NAZARENE--

04:04.870 --> 04:07.839

04:23.560 --> 04:25.528
- WHAT TIME
DID WE HEAR THAT GUNSHOT?

04:25.560 --> 04:27.289
- TEN MINUTES
INTO THE SHOW.

04:27.330 --> 04:28.991
I REMEMBER, BECAUSE CROCK
JUST MADE HIS CRANK PHONE CALL

AS WILLIE, THE TWO-YEAR-OLD
TELEMARKETER.

04:30.900 --> 04:33.869

- WHAT?

04:33.900 --> 04:35.060
- LET'S HEAR IT AGAIN.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.499

- DUDE, I--

04:39.580 --> 04:40.899
HEY!

04:40.940 --> 04:43.340
I THINK I JUST HEARD
A VOICE ON THE RECORDING,

04:43.380 --> 04:44.677
JUST BEFORE CROCK
WAS SHOT.

04:44.710 --> 04:47.611
- IS CROCK OKAY?
TELL ME HE'S OKAY!

04:47.650 --> 04:49.481
- WHO THE HELL
ARE THOSE WHACKADOS?

04:49.520 --> 04:51.340
- THOSE ARE CROCK-OS,
CROCK'S BIGGEST FANS.

04:51.390 --> 04:52.812
- DOES HE NEED SOUP?

04:52.860 --> 04:54.487
- SHE DOES REALIZE
HE WAS SHOT, RIGHT?

04:54.520 --> 04:55.919
- WHAT KIND OF SOUP
DO YOU THINK SHE'S PACKING?

04:55.960 --> 04:58.349
- NOT SURE.
SOMETHING SEASONAL, THOUGH.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.392
- WINTER BEAN.

AND I SUSPECT SHE WILL.

05:17.950 --> 05:19.417
GUS, SOMEONE HERE
KNOWS SOMETHING.

05:19.450 --> 05:20.610
- WHERE
YOU WANT TO START?

05:20.650 --> 05:21.844
- WE SHOULD START
AT THE TOP.

05:21.880 --> 05:22.881
- I HOPE
HE'S NEAR A KITCHEN.

05:22.920 --> 05:23.909

05:47.980 --> 05:49.538
YOU WANT TO TRY IT
AGAIN?

05:49.580 --> 05:50.842
I WOULDN'T
IF I WERE YOU.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.041
- OH, EXCUSE HIM.
MY NAME IS BURTON GUSTER,

05:53.080 --> 05:55.514
MS. SHERROD.
WE WERE HUGE FANS OF CROCK.

05:55.550 --> 05:57.040
I KNOW THIS MUST BE
DEVASTATING FOR YOU.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.978
- YOU CAN'T REPLACE
THESE KIND OF NUMBERS.

05:59.020 --> 06:01.511
- NO, I WAS TALKING ABOUT
AS A FRIEND.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.654
- BEING A FRIEND
IS NOT IN HIS JOB DESCRIPTION.

06:04.690 --> 06:06.954
THIS IS A CUTI'HROAT,

BERT JOHANSEN IS MY A'I'I'ORNEY.
HE WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.080

06:31.120 --> 06:34.487
- UH, MS. SHERROD,
WE WERE TRYING TO GET

06:34.520 --> 06:36.988
SOME INSIGHT INTO CROCK,
HIS BRIEF HISTORY HERE.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.828
- HE DOUBLED THE RATINGS OF
HIS PREVIOUS SHOW IN SIX MONTHS.

06:39.860 --> 06:41.521
- HE DOUBLED THE RATINGS
OF HIS PREVIOUS SHOW?

06:41.560 --> 06:43.494
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE,
WITH AUDIENCE EROSION

06:43.530 --> 06:45.589
AND COMPETITION
FROM INTERNET AND SATELLITE?

06:45.630 --> 06:48.690
- LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE HERE
IS MORE THAN JUST A PRE'ITY FACE.

06:48.740 --> 06:50.105
- [chuckles]
WELL--

06:50.140 --> 06:52.938
- CROCK'S SUCCESS
WAS IMPRESSIVE,

06:52.980 --> 06:55.175
AND IT DROVE
HIS COMPETITION CRAZY.

06:55.210 --> 06:56.939
- AS IN HIS OLD PARTNER,
DEAN BALLOU?

06:56.980 --> 06:59.005
- DEAN?
YOU BET YOUR MEGAWA'IT SMILE

06:59.050 --> 07:00.574
THAT HE WAS JEALOUS
OF CROCK.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.019
NOW WOULD YOU TWO
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE?

07:02.050 --> 07:04.086
I HAVE A CRISIS TO MANAGE.
- YES, MA'AM.

07:04.120 --> 07:12.926

07:12.960 --> 07:14.450
- SO WE'D LIKE
TO SPEAK TO YOU

07:14.500 --> 07:16.229
ABOUT YOUR FORMER PARTNER,
CROCK DANIELS.

07:16.260 --> 07:17.659
I'M SURE YOU HEARD
THAT HE WAS MURDERED.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.691
- SUCH A TRAGEDY,
DEAN-O.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.163
SINCE WE WERE ON THE SHOW,
WE CONSIDER OURSELVES FAMILY.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.829
THIS HURTS US
JUST AS MUCH AS IT HURTS YOU.

07:25.870 --> 07:27.007
- OW!

07:27.040 --> 07:28.132
- HE DESERVED IT!

07:28.180 --> 07:29.602
- WHAT?

07:29.650 --> 07:31.003
- I HATED THAT BASTARD
WITH A PASSION.

07:31.050 --> 07:32.039
- WHY ARE YOU SPEAKING
IN THAT RIDICULOUS VOICE?

07:32.080 --> 07:34.014
THIS IS
A SERIOUS MATTER.

07:34.050 --> 07:36.610
- THIS IS MY VOICE.
- SURE IT IS.

07:36.650 --> 07:37.844
AND GRAFFITI
IS AN ART FORM.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.983
- WE WERE TOGETHER
FOR 20 YEARS,

07:40.020 --> 07:42.887
THEN LAST YEAR,
HE COMES IN AND SAYS IT'S OVER.

07:42.930 --> 07:43.919
- DID HE SAY IT
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON,

07:43.960 --> 07:45.723
OR LIKE
THE MOVIE PHONE GUY?

07:45.760 --> 07:48.524
- HE BAILED ON ME
TO TAKE A SEVEN-FIGURE PAYDAY

07:48.560 --> 07:50.994
AT THAT DUMP HOLE STATION.
- SEVEN FIGURES?

07:51.030 --> 07:53.032
- MR. BALLOU, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW HOW THIS WORKS,

07:53.070 --> 07:54.935
BUT UNLESS
YOU HAVE A FIRM ALIBI,

07:54.970 --> 07:56.904
YOU'RE PAINTING YOURSELF
AS OUR NUMBER ONE SUSPECT.

07:56.940 --> 08:01.104
- I WAS DOING WHAT I'M DOING
RIGHT NOW, MY RADIO SHOW.

08:07.080 --> 08:13.952
I'VE GOT A SHOW TO DO.

08:13.990 --> 08:15.252
IT'S INCREDIBLE OUT THERE.

HE'S OUR MAN.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.176
- WHAT?
THERE'S NO WAY HE COULD HAVE

08:34.210 --> 08:36.030
PULLED OFF A CLEAN MURDER.
YOU SAW THE DUDE.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.672
- O'HARA,
LET'S CHECK HIS ALIBI.

08:37.710 --> 08:39.974
I'M GUESSING IT'S SWISS,
AS IN CHEESE,

08:40.020 --> 08:42.272
AS IN
FULL OF LACTATE.

08:42.320 --> 08:46.142
- LACTATE?
- HMM.

08:46.190 --> 08:48.112
- CROCK WAS PULLING IN
OVER $1 MILLION.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.025
MAN,
YOU KIDDING ME?

08:50.060 --> 08:51.857
- NOW WE KNOW HOW MIRANDA
GOT HIM TO SWITCH STATIONS.

08:51.890 --> 08:53.824
- I WONDER WHAT THAT MEANT
FOR THE REST OF THE STAFF.

08:53.860 --> 08:56.158
- PROBABLY
A LOT OF PAY CUTS.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.794
WHICH COULD BE MOTIVE
FOR SOMEONE TO BUMP OFF CROCK.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.559
- WELL, WELL, WELL.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.864
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S
MORE THAN JUST A BROWNISH FACE.

09:02.910 --> 09:06.835
- SHE SAID PRETTY FACE, SHAWN.
PRETTY.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.302
- HELLO AGAIN,
MS. SHERROD.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.205
IT'S YOUR FAVORITE PSYCHIC,
SHAWN SPENCER,

09:10.250 --> 09:12.070
AND HIS PARTNER,
BURTON GUSTER.

09:12.110 --> 09:14.908
- YOU JUST THREW IN THE TOWEL
ON YOUR NICKNAME GAME, HUH?

09:14.950 --> 09:16.679
- WELL, I THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T--

09:16.720 --> 09:18.244
- GUS, WHAT A PLEASURE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

09:18.290 --> 09:20.679
- MS. SHERROD.
- MIRANDA TO YOU.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.017
- JUST TO HIM?
- YES.

09:22.060 --> 09:23.948
- MIRANDA,
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE

09:23.990 --> 09:25.878
THAT CROCK'S KILLER
IS IN THIS STATION,

09:25.930 --> 09:27.227
SOMEONE
HE WORKED WITH.

09:27.260 --> 09:28.955
- AND WHY
WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.161
- BECAUSE I HAVE HAD
A VISION

09:31.200 --> 09:33.134
OF OTHER STAFFERS
TAKING HUGE PAY CUTS

09:33.170 --> 09:35.661
SO THAT YOU COULD BRING IN
A BIG SHOT LIKE CROCK.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.008
- YES, AND THEY WERE HAPPY
TO TAKE LESS

09:37.040 --> 09:39.304
AND NOT BE SENT PACKING.
TRY AGAIN.

09:39.340 --> 09:42.173
- MY ADVICE TO YOU, AND I THINK
YOU'D BE WISE TO TAKE IT,

09:42.210 --> 09:44.007
IS TO GIVE US ACCESS
TO EVERY DEPARTMENT.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.041
I'M TALKING AD SALES,
ON-AIR PERSONALITIES,

09:46.080 --> 09:47.308
PROGRAM DIRECTORS.

09:47.350 --> 09:48.908
- YOU KNOW YOUR STUFF.

09:48.950 --> 09:50.781
- WELL, I WORKED
AT MY COLLEGE RADIO STATION

09:50.820 --> 09:52.913
FOR A SEMESTER.
I WAS A BIT OF A STAR.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.053
- YOU FELL ASLEEP
DURING YOUR OWN SHOW.

09:55.090 --> 09:57.183
- IT WAS A 3:00 AM. SHOW,
SHAWN. I WAS DOING RADIO VERITE.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.050
- NOBODY NOTICED.

09:59.090 --> 10:02.924
- WHAT I'M SAYING IS
YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.926
- THEY DON'T SUCK.
- THEY'RE NOT GREAT.

10:04.970 --> 10:06.995
- KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT,
BUT YOU BETTER MAKE IT QUICK,

10:07.040 --> 10:08.996
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT
TO SHUT THE STATION DOWN.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.759
both: WHAT?
- UH, MS. SHERROD,

10:11.810 --> 10:14.028
I REALIZE
THAT YOUR STAFF IS SMALL,

10:14.080 --> 10:16.230
AND WHILE MY TALENTS
ARE PRODIGIOUS,

10:16.280 --> 10:19.147
IT WILL TAKE ME SOME TIME
TO VET THEM ALL.

10:19.180 --> 10:21.068
- WITHOUT CROCK,
I HAVE NOTHING,

10:21.120 --> 10:24.715
AND I CAN'T KEEP PUTTING
THESE OTHER MORONS ON THE AIR.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.411
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
BRING IN SOME NEW BLOOD?

10:26.450 --> 10:28.008
- AND WHAT DO YOU
SUGGEST I DO?

10:28.060 --> 10:35.023
JUST PLUCK SOMEONE
OFF THE STREET?

10:35.060 --> 10:38.723
- GOOD MORNING,

10:38.770 --> 10:42.331
SANTA BARBS!

10:42.370 --> 10:43.928
[cow bell tap]

10:46.210 --> 10:47.871

10:49.850 --> 10:53.672

10:53.720 --> 10:55.176
- LOOK, WHOEVER THIS IS,

10:58.420 --> 10:59.978
WAIT A MINUTE.

11:00.020 --> 11:01.248
SHAWN?
- OOPS.

11:01.290 --> 11:04.828
- YOU [bleep]ING IDIOT!
[click]

11:04.860 --> 11:08.956
- THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE TO
BE BALD, ANGRY, AND DIVORCED...

11:09.000 --> 11:10.228
[cow bell tap]

11:10.270 --> 11:11.794
WITH NIPPLES
LIKE ELEPHANT DARTS.

11:11.830 --> 11:13.058
- [laughs]
- WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK,

11:13.100 --> 11:16.137
AFI'ER WE PAY SOME BILLS.
- [laughs]

11:16.170 --> 11:17.762
- PHEW!

11:17.810 --> 11:19.266
MAN, I'M EXHAUSTED.

11:19.310 --> 11:21.073
I GUESS, NOW THAT WE HAVE
THE FIRST HOUR UNDER OUR BELTS,

11:22.240 --> 11:24.379
SEA LEGS, AND WHATNOT.
- HOUR?

11:24.410 --> 11:25.946
- YOU'VE BEEN ON
FOR SEVEN MINUTES.

11:25.980 --> 11:29.040
- WHAT? WE HAVE 4 HOURS
AND 53 MINUTES TO GO?

11:29.080 --> 11:31.742
- TALK ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE.
LISTENERS LOVE THAT STUFF.

11:31.790 --> 11:35.055
- YEAH.
YEAH, WHAT SYD SAID,

11:35.090 --> 11:38.719
EXPOSE MYSELF, OPEN UP,
GET PERSONAL.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.398
WELCOME BACK,
SANTA BARBARA.

11:40.430 --> 11:42.921
YOU GUESSED IT,
IT'S TIME TO GET PERSONAL.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.894
[cow bell tap]

11:45.930 --> 11:47.989
UH--

11:48.040 --> 11:50.429
HEY, GUS, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT YOUR GIRLFRIEND

11:50.470 --> 11:52.938
HEADING BACK TO THE U.K.
FOR SIX MONTHS?

11:52.980 --> 11:55.198
- WHAT?
RACHAEL'S HEADING OVERSEAS?

11:55.240 --> 11:58.243
- JULIET TOLD ME.
I ASSUMED YOU ALREADY KNEW.

11:58.280 --> 12:01.147
- JULIET KNOWS? AND NOW,
SO DOES ALL OF SANTA BARBARA.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.943
WHY IS SHE LEAVING?
WHY HASN'T SHE TOLD ME?

12:02.990 --> 12:04.981
- THAT'S NOT
THE MUTE BUTTON...

12:05.020 --> 12:06.339
AND YOU HAVE A CALL.

12:06.390 --> 12:08.381
WE HAVE A RACHAEL
FROM SANTA BARBARA.

12:08.420 --> 12:11.787
- NO, NO, NO. NO, SHAWN,
DO NOT TAKE THAT CALL!

12:11.830 --> 12:12.956
- YOU DESERVE
AN EXPLANATION.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.025
- NOT ON THE RA--

12:15.060 --> 12:17.028
NOT ON THE RADIO!

12:17.070 --> 12:21.439
- RACHAEL FROM SANTA BARBARA,
YOU'RE LIVE ON SPENCE-AIR.

12:21.470 --> 12:23.802
- GUS?
WE NEED TO TALK.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.058
- I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY, RACHAEL.

12:26.110 --> 12:27.202
- BUDDY,
THAT'S JUST BAD RADIO.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.901
- I DON'T CARE.

12:28.940 --> 12:30.339
MY LIFE IS NOT FODDER
FOR YOUR SHOW, SHAWN.

12:30.380 --> 12:31.972
I'M NOT GOING TO USE MY PAIN
TO FILL AIR TIME.

12:32.010 --> 12:34.979
RACHAEL, HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

12:35.020 --> 12:36.988
IS THIS
ABOUT MAX'S DAD?

12:37.020 --> 12:39.818
- ONLY GOING BACK TO SORT OUT
SOME IMMIGRATION ISSUES.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.157
- [scoffs]
- GUS, THAT RELATIONSHIP

12:41.190 --> 12:42.953
IS LONG OVER.
- [scoffs]

12:42.990 --> 12:44.457
- I'M WITH YOU NOW.

12:44.490 --> 12:51.464
YOU'VE NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

12:51.500 --> 12:52.933
- YOU STAY CLASSY,
SANTA BARBARA.

12:52.970 --> 12:55.859
THANKS FOR SPENDING YOUR MORNING
WITH ME!

12:55.900 --> 13:01.907
SPENCE-AIR, OUT.

13:01.940 --> 13:04.079
- MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I JUST TO CONFESSED

13:04.110 --> 13:05.907
TO ALL OF SANTA BARBARA THAT
I MAKE LOVE WITH MY SOCKS ON.

13:05.950 --> 13:07.269
- YOU SURE DID.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.514
- HEY, GUYS,
I'M GOING TO TAKE OFF.

13:08.550 --> 13:09.881
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THANK YOU.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.114
- THANK US?
FOR WHAT?

13:11.150 --> 13:13.459
- OH, FOR NOT ASKING ME
TO MEASURE MY JUNK

13:13.490 --> 13:15.879
OR CRAN K-CALLING
MY BIRTH MOM ON THE AIR.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.182
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:17.230 --> 13:18.959
- THAT WAS ALWAYS
CROCK'S MOVE.

13:18.990 --> 13:21.129
HE DID WHATEVER HE COULD
TO HUMILIATE ME FOR LAUGHS.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.525
- YOU WERE OKAY
WITH THAT?

13:22.560 --> 13:23.959
- NO,
BUT WHAT COULD I DO?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.092
POP A COUPLE CAPS
IN HIM

13:25.130 --> 13:26.961
AND PRETEND
SOMEONE KNOCKED ME OUT?

13:27.000 --> 13:30.367
- [laughs]
SYD, THAT'S--

13:30.410 --> 13:33.937
THAT'S. . . DARK.
- NO.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.869
DUDE, DID THAT MAN
JUST CONFESS TO US?

13:36.910 --> 13:39.071
- NO.
IT'S WAY TOO EASY.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.338
WE SHOULD TALK
TO THE OTHER EMPLOYEES.

13:40.380 --> 13:42.075
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.008
I'M FILING HIM
UNDER "SUSPECT NUMBER ONE."

13:44.050 --> 13:46.041
[knocking at the door]

13:46.090 --> 13:48.115
HELLO?

13:48.160 --> 13:50.879
DANG!
- WHOA.

13:50.930 --> 13:53.398
- THIS GUY REDD
KILLS A LOT OF STUFF, SHAWN.

13:53.430 --> 13:55.057
- IT CERTAINLY EXPLAINS
WHY MY DAD

13:55.100 --> 13:57.068
LIKES HIS OUTDOORS SHOW
SO MUCH.

13:57.100 --> 14:01.036
- HEY, BEAVER.
LOOK AT YA.

14:01.070 --> 14:02.867
NATURE'S ENGINEER.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.060
YOU DON'T BELONG
STUFFED IN SOMEBODY'S OFFICE.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.203
MAYBE REDD NEEDS
A TASTE OF HIS OWN MEDICINE,

14:07.240 --> 14:10.346
SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE
BEING STALKED AND HUNTED.

14:10.380 --> 14:11.506
- JUST NAME
THE TIME AND THE PLACE.

14:11.550 --> 14:14.041
- WHOA, HEY,
REDD HERRING.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.412
[chuckles] IAM RADIO
PERSONALITY, SHAWN SPENCER,

14:16.450 --> 14:17.883
AND THIS IS--

14:17.920 --> 14:21.959
- THE MAN
WHO'S GONNA HUNT ME.

14:21.990 --> 14:24.026
SON...

14:24.060 --> 14:27.029
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES

14:27.060 --> 14:29.961
TO TRACK ME DOWN
AND SHOOT ME?

14:30.000 --> 14:34.039
- UH, REDD,
DID YOU KILL CROCK?

14:34.070 --> 14:38.200
- [laughs]
IF I WANTED TO KILL CROCK...

14:38.240 --> 14:39.639
I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.501
- FAIR POINT.
THAT'S FAIR.

14:41.540 --> 14:43.349
BUT WERE YOU ANGRY
WITH HIM?

14:43.380 --> 14:45.905
BECAUSE YOU DID HAVE TO TAKE
A PAY CUT WHEN HE CAME ON BOARD.

14:45.950 --> 14:48.475
- AND, UM, ARE YOU SURE
YOU DIDN'T KILL CROCK?

14:48.520 --> 14:51.944
- WELL, I DID HAVE
TO TAKE A TEENY PAY CUT,

14:51.990 --> 14:54.652
BUT MOST OF CROCK'S SALARY
COME OUT OF MIRANDA'S BIRD BAG.

14:54.690 --> 14:56.453
SHE JUST USED CROCK
TO BOOST HER RATINGS

14:56.490 --> 14:58.321
TILL SHE COULD SELL THE STATION
TO CLEAR CHANNEL

14:58.360 --> 15:01.693
AND MAKE HER MONEY BACK,
BUT THE DEAL FELL THROUGH.

15:01.730 --> 15:04.267
- REALLY?
- DEAL FELL THROUGH?

15:04.300 --> 15:05.995
GOOD TALK, REDD.
- GREAT TALK.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.930
- GOOD-BYE FOREVER.
- SEE YOU

15:07.970 --> 15:10.939
IN MY RECURRING
HUNGER GAMES NIGHTMARE.

15:10.970 --> 15:14.030
DUDE, MIRANDA HAD MOTIVE
TO KILL CROCK.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.377
ONCE THE STATION
DIDN'T SELL,

15:15.410 --> 15:17.071
SHE WAS ON THE HOOK
FOR THE REST OF HIS DEAL.

15:17.110 --> 15:18.247
- WE GOTTA PUT
THE NAILS TO HER.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.679
- HOW? SHE KNOWS
WE'RE INVESTIGATING.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.246
SHE'LL SEE US COMING
A MILE AWAY.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.282
- IF ONLY WE KNEW SOMEONE
WITH A MEGAWATT SMILE.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.083
HE COULD GET HER FROM BEHIND.
- WHAT?

15:25.120 --> 15:27.054
- YOU KNOW,
SLIP IN BENEATH HER GUARD

15:27.090 --> 15:30.127
WITH HIS GORGEOUS FACE.
- MAN!

15:30.160 --> 15:40.729
[doorbell dings]

15:40.770 --> 15:47.278
[sighs]

15:47.310 --> 15:49.699
HI. OUR DINNER RESERVATION
IS AT 8:00.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.503
WE WILL ARRIVE
IN SEPARATE VEHICLES.

15:51.550 --> 15:54.713
ONCE THERE, WE WILL CONVERSE
ABOUT BUSINESS ONLY.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.570
AFTER OUR MEAL,
WE WILL SHAKE HANDS

15:56.620 --> 15:58.542
AND DRIVE AWAY
SEPARATELY.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.251
- I SEE.

16:00.290 --> 16:03.123
YOU'RE LIKE A MORE AGITATED
BLAIR UNDERWOOD,

16:03.160 --> 16:05.082
BUT I HAVE
A COUNTEROFFER.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.997
WE STAY HERE. I COOK YOU
A JERK CHICKEN DINNER

16:08.030 --> 16:10.260
WEARING THIS.

16:10.300 --> 16:13.667
- COUNTER-COUNTEROFFER.
JERK CHICKEN, NO APRON,

16:13.700 --> 16:15.463
WE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
AT THE STATION.

16:15.500 --> 16:18.537
- COUNTER-COUNTER-COUNTEROFFER.
JERK CHICKEN,

16:18.570 --> 16:23.269
APRON ON TOP OF DRESS, OPTION
TO BEND OVER ONLY AS NEEDED.

16:23.310 --> 16:29.010
- DEAL.

16:29.050 --> 16:31.143
OH, GOSH.

16:31.190 --> 16:33.408
SO THIS DEAL
WITH CROCK

16:33.460 --> 16:34.688
WAS THE LARGEST
TALENT ACQUISITION

16:34.720 --> 16:35.755
YOU EVER MADE,
RIGHT?

16:35.790 --> 16:38.429
- MM-HMM.
- HMM.

16:38.460 --> 16:43.124
MM-MM.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.797
- I LIKE HOW YOU KNOW
YOUR WAY AROUND A CHICKEN LEG.

16:44.830 --> 16:46.263
- MM-HMM.

16:46.300 --> 16:52.068
- HOW DO YOU DO
WITH THE HUMAN KIND?

16:52.110 --> 16:55.136
- UM...

16:55.180 --> 16:56.670
AS I WAS SAYING,

16:56.710 --> 16:58.644
IF ALL YOUR ASSETS
WERE WRAPPED UP AT THE STATION,

16:58.680 --> 17:00.716
YOU'D BE
IN SOME PRETTY HOT WATER

17:00.750 --> 17:02.638
IF A BUSINESS DEAL
SUDDENLY WENT SOUTH.

17:02.680 --> 17:05.217
- YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE CLEAR CHANNEL DEAL?

17:05.250 --> 17:07.787
- BUT CROCK'S DEATH MAKES
HIS CONTRACT VOID, AM I CORRECT?

17:07.820 --> 17:09.811
- OH.

17:09.860 --> 17:13.125
YOU THINK I KILLED HIM JUST
TO GET OUT OF THE MONEY I OWE?

17:13.160 --> 17:16.129
[scoffs]
WH--?

17:16.160 --> 17:17.229
- UH, UH,

17:17.270 --> 17:19.659
WELL, HOLD ON. HOLD ON.
HOLD ON, NOW.

17:19.700 --> 17:22.066
MIRANDA, MIRANDA, MIRANDA,
CALM DOWN.

17:22.100 --> 17:24.705
NO ONE SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT ANYBODY KILLING ANYBODY.

17:24.740 --> 17:26.560
- I LOVE THAT YOU THINK
THAT I COULD BE SO CUNNING,

17:26.610 --> 17:30.398
SO CALCULATED THAT I COULD
PULL OFF THE PERFECT MURDER.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.701
- I DIDN'T SAY
"PERFECT."

17:31.750 --> 17:33.377
- IT WOULD BE
IF I DID IT.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.513
INTERROGATE ME, BURTON!
- WHAT?

17:35.550 --> 17:37.541
- TURN THE SCREWS.
SEE IF I'LL BREAK.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.546
- UH, WHERE WERE YOU
THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER?

17:39.590 --> 17:40.852
- FASTER.
- UH, WHERE WERE YOU

17:40.890 --> 17:42.414
THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER?
- SLOWER.

17:42.460 --> 17:45.486
- WHERE WERE YOU...
THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER?

17:45.530 --> 17:46.758
- YOU'RE NOT ATTRACTED TO ME,
ARE YOU?

17:46.790 --> 17:48.326
- WELL, NO,
THAT'S NOT IT.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.827
- THAT'S RHETORICAL.
OF COURSE, YOU ARE.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.590
- LOOK, I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP,
MIRANDA, A REAL ONE,

17:52.630 --> 17:54.166
AND NOT JUST ONE
WITH GOD.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.498
RACHAEL AND I HAVE
OUR ISSUES, YES,

17:56.540 --> 17:58.565
BUT WE ARE COMMITTED
TO MAKING IT WORK.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.271
- YOU HAVE SEX
WITH YOUR SOCKS ON

18:00.310 --> 18:01.675
BECAUSE YOUR TOES GET COLD.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

18:01.710 --> 18:04.440
- _YE
[whimpse.!rs]

18:04.480 --> 18:06.869
SEE--SEE, HERE'S YOUR PROBLEM,
MIRANDA.

18:06.910 --> 18:11.142
SOME MEN--EVOLVED MEN--
SEEK A CHASE, SEEK ROMANCE.

18:11.190 --> 18:14.284
I AM ONE OF THOSE MEN.
I BELIEVE IN SLOW SEDUCTION.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.811
I BELIEVE IN FEEDING EACH OTHER
POACHED EGGS IN BED

18:16.860 --> 18:18.885
AND LEAVING LOVE NOTES
SQUEEGEED ON THE SHOWER DOOR.

18:18.930 --> 18:20.488
I BELIEVE IN WRITING

18:20.530 --> 18:22.122
THE SOUNDTRACK
TO EACH OTHER'S LIVES.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.366
I BELIEVE I CAN FLY.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.799
WHAT?

18:24.830 --> 18:31.804
I BELIEVE IN MAKING MY WOMAN
MY QUEEN.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.276
WELL, SHAWN,
I HAVE GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS.

18:35.310 --> 18:36.777
- YOU KNOW
I'M BAD NEWS FIRST

18:36.810 --> 18:38.801
EVER SINCE WE SAW PROMETHEUS
ON OPENING NIGHT.

18:38.850 --> 18:41.273
- I HAD TO ENDURE SOME SERIOUS
SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAST NIGHT.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.584
MIRANDA ACTUALLY
WANTED TO BE INTERROGATED.

18:43.620 --> 18:45.645
- HOW IS THAT THE BAD NEWS?
- THAT'S NOT THE BAD NEWS.

18:45.690 --> 18:48.181
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT SHE MADE
A DECISION TO CANCEL YOUR SHOW.

18:48.220 --> 18:49.448
- WHAT?
- YUP.

18:49.490 --> 18:50.889
- COME ON, SON,
I WAS ONLY ON FOR A DAY!

18:50.930 --> 18:52.352
- THE RADIO GAME
IS BRUTAL.

18:52.390 --> 18:54.426
- SURE IS.
AIN'T THAT A--

18:54.460 --> 18:56.599
WELL,
WHAT'S THE GOOD NEWS?

18:56.630 --> 18:58.518
- SHE FOUND
A REPLACEMENT.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.731
[slurps coffee]

19:00.770 --> 19:03.659
AHH.

19:03.710 --> 19:08.500
- AWWWW, YEEEAAAH.

19:08.540 --> 19:12.772
SANTA BARBARA, YOU ARE NOW
ENTERING THE SMOOTH STORM.

19:12.810 --> 19:16.678
[thunder effects]
KJAD'S NEW AFI'ER-DARK TALK.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.848
I'M YOUR HOST,
A PLAYER NAMED GUS.

19:19.890 --> 19:21.858
NOW SIT BACK
AND CHILLAX WITH ME,

19:21.890 --> 19:24.222
AS I TAKE YOU
ON A FUNKY RIDE.

19:24.260 --> 19:27.855
IF YOU DON'T SCREAM, WELL,
I SURE ENOUGH WON'T HOLLER.

19:27.900 --> 19:32.928
[chuckles]
YOU FEEL ME, WHITE CHOCOLATE?

19:32.970 --> 19:36.895
- SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE GONNA DO
"A PLAYER NAMED GUS?"

19:36.940 --> 19:39.261
MAN, YOU COULDN'T EVEN
STAY AWAKE

19:39.310 --> 19:40.834
DOING THIS SHTICK
IN COLLEGE!

19:40.880 --> 19:42.609
- MIRANDA HAS A VISION
FOR ME, SHAWN.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.245
- YEAH, YOU, STANDING NAKED,
POSING LIKE CAPTAIN MORGAN.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.271
- SHE STILL BELIEVES I KNOW
WOMEN AND HOW THEY OPERATE

19:47.320 --> 19:48.912
AND WHAT IT MEANS
TO TOUCH SOMEONE.

19:48.950 --> 19:50.781
I HAVE THE POWER
TO TOUCH PEOPLE, SHAWN.

19:50.820 --> 19:52.583
- SHE PROBABLY KILLED
CROCK DANIELS.

19:52.620 --> 19:55.418
- WELL,
UNTIL WE KNOW FOR SURE...

19:55.460 --> 19:58.554
WHY DON'T WE
OPEN UP THESE CALL LINES

19:58.590 --> 20:00.797
FOR ALL YOU LOVERS
OUT THERE?

20:00.830 --> 20:03.492
- WE HAVE LONG-TIME CALLER,
LAURA, ON LINE ONE.

20:03.530 --> 20:04.861
- WHAT?
HE ACTUALLY HAS A CALLER?

20:04.900 --> 20:08.438
- AWWWW, YEEEAAAH.

20:08.470 --> 20:12.236
L-BOOGIE. WHY DON'T YOU TELL
A PLAYER NAMED GUS

20:12.270 --> 20:13.931
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

20:13.980 --> 20:15.971
- I'VE ALWAYS LISTENED
TO KJAD,

20:16.010 --> 20:19.241
AND I WAS A BIG FAN
OF THE CROCK PO SHOW,

20:19.280 --> 20:22.408
BUT Al-TER HEARING
YOUR SMOOTH VOICE,

20:22.450 --> 20:25.908
I KNEW I HAD TO BE THE FIRST
TO CALL AND SAY HELLO.

20:25.950 --> 20:28.714
- WELL, I LIKE
HOW YOU SOUND, GIRL.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.524
- [chuckles]
I LIKE HOW YOU SOUND TOO.

20:31.560 --> 20:32.857
- [chuckles]

20:32.890 --> 20:35.688
- WHAT IS
YOUR RELATIONSHIP SITUATION?

20:35.730 --> 20:39.791
- WELL, L-BOOGIE,
I DO HAVE A SPECIAL FRIEND.

20:39.830 --> 20:42.663
- OH, DOES THAT MEAN
I CAN'T HAVE A HUG?

20:42.700 --> 20:44.429
- [laughs]

20:44.470 --> 20:49.999
I TELL YOU WHAT, THIS IS ME
HUGGING YOU OVER THE AIRWAVES.

20:50.040 --> 20:54.579
MMM.
MMM.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.975
MMM.

20:57.020 --> 20:58.817
[chuckles]
YOU FEEL THAT?

20:58.850 --> 21:01.819
- HEY,
MAYBE I SHOULD COME ON DOWN.

21:01.860 --> 21:04.351
- UH, A PLAYER NAMED GUS
IS GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER CALL

21:04.390 --> 21:06.824
AS QUICK AS HE CAN,
SO YOU HANG RIGHT THERE, LAURA.

21:06.860 --> 21:07.997
- I'LL BE WAITING.
- RIGHT NOW,

21:08.030 --> 21:10.863
WE HAVE JALINDA
ON THE LINE.

21:10.900 --> 21:15.599
- [high-pitched] OH, HI.
MY NAME IS JALINDA.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.801
AND I
WAS JUST WONDERING

21:17.840 --> 21:20.331
IF THIS IS
THE SAME PLAYER NAMED GUS

21:20.380 --> 21:23.975
WHO BACK AT CAMP TIKI-HAMA
HAD TO USE RUBBER SHEETS,

21:24.010 --> 21:28.049
BECAUSE EVERY NIGHT, HE WOULD
WATER-LOG HIS MATTRESS.

21:28.080 --> 21:32.688
- UH, PEOPLE OUT THERE,
A PLAYER NAMED GUS WAS FIVE,

21:32.720 --> 21:36.315
YOU DIG? AND THEN HE DISCOVERED
HE HAD A SHY BLADDER.

21:36.360 --> 21:40.649
- [giggles] WELL,
THAT MAKES ME FEEL FUNNY.

21:40.700 --> 21:45.865
- JALINDA, YOU KEEP ON TALKING
RIGHT THERE, ALL RIGHT?

21:45.900 --> 21:47.891
- IS THIS THE SAME
PLAYER NAMED GUS

21:47.940 --> 21:51.762
THAT USED TO RUN
SO HARD AND SO FAST

21:51.810 --> 21:54.335
IN HIS SQUISHY BOOTS
AT THE PLAYGROUND,

21:54.380 --> 21:57.975
THAT ONCE HE TRIPPED
AND SPRAINED HIS DING-DING?

21:58.010 --> 22:00.046
- DUDE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:00.080 --> 22:01.968
- WHAT AM I DOING?
I'M INVESTIGATING.

22:02.020 --> 22:02.941
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:02.980 --> 22:04.914
- WHAT I WAS BORN TO DO,
SHAWN.

22:04.950 --> 22:07.748
- YEAH, WELL, WHILE YOU'RE
EXERCISING YOUR BIRTHRIGHT,

22:07.790 --> 22:09.382
I FOUND THIS.

22:09.420 --> 22:11.923
MIRANDA'S WORTH OVER $8 MILLION
IN ASSETS ALONE,

22:11.960 --> 22:13.894
AND SHE OWNS
THREE EL POLLO LOCOS.

22:13.930 --> 22:15.056
- REALLY?
WHICH ONES?

22:15.100 --> 22:16.897
THE ONE
WITH THE REALLY HUGE SALSA BAR?

22:16.930 --> 22:18.659
- MAN, YOU KNOW THEY ALL
HAVE BIG-ASS SALSA BARS.

22:18.700 --> 22:20.895
- WAIT A SECOND, THAT MEANS
MIRANDA MOST DEFINITELY

22:20.940 --> 22:22.567
DIDN'T KILL CROCK
OVER THE CLEAR CHANNEL DEAL.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.136
- NO KIDDING,
BRUCE WAYNE.

22:24.170 --> 22:26.434
- FIRST RULE
OF RADIO,

22:26.470 --> 22:28.836
SOMEONE ACTUALLY
HAS TO BE ON THE AIR.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.871
- YOU'RE FILTHY RICH.
- AND JUST PLAIN FILTHY.

22:30.910 --> 22:32.673
- WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
CLEAR YOUR NAME LAST NIGHT?

22:32.710 --> 22:34.018
- WHAT,
AND MISS THE OPPORTUNITY

22:34.050 --> 22:36.575
TO HAVE YOU
TURN THE SCREWS TO ME?

22:36.620 --> 22:45.927
NOW, WILL YOU TWO
GET BACK ON AIR?

22:45.960 --> 22:48.690
- L-BOOGIE,
YOU STILL THERE?

22:48.730 --> 22:50.869
- OF COURSE,
I'D WAIT ALL DAY.

22:50.900 --> 22:54.734
- AWWWW, YEEEAAAH.

22:54.770 --> 22:57.659
[cow bell taps]

22:57.710 --> 22:59.666
- ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
A WALK TO YOUR CAR?

22:59.710 --> 23:01.075
- [chuckles] VERY.

23:01.110 --> 23:03.601
- STELLAR DEBUT, GUS.
- SHUT UP.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.072
- THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING.

23:05.110 --> 23:15.156
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
[chuckles]

23:15.160 --> 23:21.599
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
[chuckles]

23:21.630 --> 23:23.052
[keys drop
on the ground]

23:23.100 --> 23:25.466
[gunshot]

23:31.140 --> 23:32.698
- [whimpering]
- COME ON, GUS.

23:32.740 --> 23:33.968
COME ON, BUDDY, BREATHE.
IN THROUGH YOUR NOSE

23:34.010 --> 23:36.808
AND JUST--J_UST BREATHE.
- [whimpers]

23:36.840 --> 23:38.842
- ALL RIGHT, NOBODY
GOT A LOOK AT OUR SHOOTER,

23:38.880 --> 23:41.474
BUT WE DO HAVE THE SECURITY
VIDEO FROM THE PARKING LOT.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.647
- JUST DOWNLOADED IT
FROM THE MAIN SERVER.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.214
- OH.
- NICE, SYD, NICE.

23:45.250 --> 23:46.649
- OKAY.

23:46.690 --> 23:51.684
[screaming]

23:51.730 --> 23:55.029
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
WHEN I FAINTED.

23:55.060 --> 23:57.722
- THIS IS WHEN MIRANDA FOUND HIM
AND GAVE HIM MOUTH-TO-MOUTH.

23:57.770 --> 24:01.592
- SHE WHAT?
- HMM.

24:01.640 --> 24:05.007
- I'LL FAST-FORWARD THIS.
THIS GOES ON FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.769
- UH, YEAH, JUST--

24:06.810 --> 24:09.199
- MOUTH-TO-MOUTH.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.878
MOUTH-TO-MOUTH.
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

24:10.910 --> 24:11.945
- YOUR LITTLE LEGS
ARE JUST

24:11.980 --> 24:14.175
KICKING ALL OVER THE PLACE
THERE.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.245
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, GUS,
I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY

24:16.280 --> 24:18.043
TAKE IT FROM HERE.
- YEAH.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.842
- WHY DON'T YOU, UH,
WHY DON'T YOU CLEAR YOUR HEAD

24:19.890 --> 24:22.586
AND RINSE AND SPIT.
- OKAY.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.588
[wincing]

24:24.630 --> 24:27.724
- SHOULD I BE WORRIED?
- WHAT, ABOUT THAT? NO.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.557
SHE JUST THOUGHT MY CONDITION
WAS WORSE THAN WHAT IT WAS.

24:29.600 --> 24:30.919
- I'M SURE SHE DID.
- YEAH.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.722
COME ON, LET'S GET YOU HOME.
- OKAY.

24:32.770 --> 24:34.829
- SO I THINK IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME
WHOEVER TOOK A SHOT AT GUS

24:34.870 --> 24:35.996
ALSO KILLED CROCK.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.735
- WHY IS IT SAFE
TO ASSUME THAT?

24:37.770 --> 24:40.933
I MEAN, I WAS ON THE AIR FIRST,
NOBODY TRIED TO KILL ME.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.777
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN MY SHOW AND HIS SHOW?

24:42.810 --> 24:45.802
- WHERE TO START?
UM, GUS WAS GOOD.

24:45.850 --> 24:47.875
- WHAT?
- GUS HAD CALLERS.

24:47.920 --> 25:02.199
- COME ON, SYD.

25:02.230 --> 25:04.926
I HAVE A LINK
BETWEEN GUS AND CROCK.

25:04.970 --> 25:09.031
IT IS A CALLER,
AND HER NAME IS LAURA.

25:09.070 --> 25:11.209
- SHE WAS THE PRESIDENT
OF CROCK'S FAN CLUB.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.970
ODD DUCK.
NICE CANS.

25:14.010 --> 25:15.568
- WHICH MEANS SHE WOULD HAVE
KNOWN THE STATION WELL ENOUGH

25:15.610 --> 25:18.272
TO GET IN, KILL CROCK,
AND GET OUT WITHOUT BEING SEEN.

25:18.310 --> 25:19.948
- YOU GOT ALL THAT
FROM HER CANS?

25:19.980 --> 25:22.141
- RUMOR WAS, SHE AND CROCK
HAD A FLING AT ONE POINT.

25:22.180 --> 25:23.943
- [whistles]
- OOH, THINK MAYBE

25:23.990 --> 25:26.083
SHE WAS A JILTED LOVER
WHO WAS OUT FOR REVENGE?

25:26.120 --> 25:27.985
- IT'S WORTH
CHECKING 'EM OUT.

25:28.020 --> 25:30.079
HER.
IT'S WORTH CHECKING HER OUT.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.951
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT.
- WOW, GUYS, WOW.

25:31.990 --> 25:36.927
- [laughs]

25:36.960 --> 25:38.791
- HAVE A SEAT.
- THANK YOU.

25:38.830 --> 25:42.038
SO WE ARE INVESTIGATING
THE MURDER OF CROCK DANIELS,

25:42.070 --> 25:45.164
AND WE'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE DOZENS OF CALLS

25:45.210 --> 25:46.962
YOU MADE
TO THE CROCK PO SHOW.

25:47.010 --> 25:51.208
- DON'T TOUCH THOSE.
THOSE ARE CROCK'S JELLY BEANS.

25:51.250 --> 25:54.970
I WAS A BIG FAN GIRL OF HIS.
WE MADE OUT ONCE.

25:55.020 --> 25:58.046
I WAS DEVASTATED
WHEN HE WAS KILLED ON THE AIR.

25:58.090 --> 26:01.355
- HMM.
- UH-UH!

26:01.390 --> 26:04.052
- YOU ALSO MADE NUMEROUS CALLS
IN TO THE SMOOTH STORM,

26:04.090 --> 26:06.149
RIGHT BEFORE SOMEONE
TRIED TO KILL ITS HOST.

26:06.190 --> 26:09.227
- WHAT?
IS A PLAYER NAMED GUS OKAY?

26:09.260 --> 26:10.329
- OH, MY GOD.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.793
- HE'S FINE.

26:11.830 --> 26:13.263
- BY THE WAY,
HIS NAME IS JUST "GUS,"

26:13.300 --> 26:14.938
AND HE WEARS
FOOTY PAJAMAS,

26:14.970 --> 26:17.165
AND HE GETS GOUT,
LIKE, THREE TIMES A YEAR.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.758
- OH!
- I'M SERIOUS,

26:18.810 --> 26:20.004
WE CALL HIM
"BURTON GOUT-STER."

26:20.040 --> 26:22.235
- [laughing]

26:22.280 --> 26:24.043
- LAURA, RIGHT NOW,
YOU ARE THE COMMON LINK

26:24.080 --> 26:25.377
BETWEEN
THESE TWO INCIDENTS.

26:25.410 --> 26:28.971
- LISTEN, I CALL IN
TO PLENTY OF RADIO SHOWS.

26:29.020 --> 26:30.612
EVER SINCE
MY PARENTS DIED,

26:30.650 --> 26:32.186
IT'S JUST KINDA LONELY

26:32.220 --> 26:34.256
IN THIS BIG, OLD HOUSE
ALL BY MYSELF.

26:34.290 --> 26:36.258
- MM, DON'T CARE.
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT,

26:36.290 --> 26:37.882
AND ALSO
AT THE TIME OF CROCK'S MURDER?

26:37.930 --> 26:39.227
- RIGHT HERE,

26:39.260 --> 26:42.889
MAKING SHIRTS AND BUTTONS
AND PUDDING AND THINGS.

26:42.930 --> 26:45.967
- PUDDING.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.230
- AWWWW, YEEEAAAH.

26:48.270 --> 26:49.965
- THAT'S A MONUMENTAL WASTE
OF YOUR TIME.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.865
DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK
AROUND YOUR HOUSE?

26:51.910 --> 26:54.401
- OH, NO.
TO BE HONEST,

26:54.440 --> 26:56.408
I THOUGHT YOU WERE HERE
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT BOB.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.273
- WHO'S BOB?
- MY STALKER.

26:59.310 --> 27:03.041
- UM, ISN'T THAT SORT OF LIKE
A BIRD EATING ANOTHER BIRD?

27:03.080 --> 27:04.980
- THAT HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME.

27:05.020 --> 27:06.840
- SHH. SWEETHEART,
I THOUGHT WE AGREED

27:06.890 --> 27:08.084
THAT BIRDS
WERE MY THING.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.917
- BOB IS THIS GUY
WHO USED TO HANG OUT

27:09.960 --> 27:11.951
AT MY LOCAL COFFEE SHOP,
LATTE DA.

27:11.990 --> 27:13.719
HE ONCE
BOUGHT ME A MUFFIN.

27:13.760 --> 27:17.127
ANYWAY, HE STARTED SHOWING UP
AT THE PLACES I GO TO REGULARLY,

27:17.160 --> 27:20.869
AND I WAS NICE TO HIM,
BUT HE TOOK IT THE WRONG WAY.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.128
- DOES BOB
HAVE A LAST NAME?

27:22.170 --> 27:24.866
- DON'T KNOW IT.
DON'T WANT TO KNOW IT.

27:24.910 --> 27:26.434
HE FREAKED ME OUT.

27:26.470 --> 27:28.404
HE ALSO SOMEHOW
GOT MY PHONE NUMBER

27:28.440 --> 27:30.271
AND STARTED
CALLING ME.

27:30.310 --> 27:35.043
[deep voice] "HI, LAURA, WHY
WEREN'T YOU AT COFFEE TODAY?

27:35.080 --> 27:38.186
TOO BUSY
ON THE RADIO?"

27:38.220 --> 27:39.881
- THE EGGHEADS
DOWN AT THE DEPARTMENT

27:39.920 --> 27:41.182
SAID THEY PULLED
A GRAVELLY VOICE

27:41.220 --> 27:43.017
OFF THE RECORDING
OF CROCK'S LAST SHOW.

27:43.060 --> 27:45.324
- COULD YOU DESCRIBE THIS BOB
TO A SKETCH ARTIST?

27:45.360 --> 27:49.023
- OF COURSE, ABSOLUTELY.
THAT'S NEAT.

27:49.060 --> 27:52.359
- WHAT?
I DECIDED TO STOP HATIN'.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.436
- THIS IS THE SKETCH ARTIST'S
RENDITION OF BOB,

27:54.470 --> 27:56.938
BASED ON
LAURA'S DESCRIPTION.

27:56.970 --> 27:58.835
- COULD THIS GUY
LOOK ANY MORE

27:58.870 --> 28:00.929
LIKE A STEREOTYPICAL
COMIC BOOK VILLAIN?

28:00.980 --> 28:02.231
- GREAT,
THANKS GUYS.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.874
SO LISTEN TO THIS--
A GUY NAMED BOB

28:04.910 --> 28:06.446
CALLED IN TO THE CROCK SHOW
A FEW WEEKS AGO

28:06.480 --> 28:08.016
AND HAD SOME CHOICE WORDS
FOR HIM,

28:08.050 --> 28:10.780
RIGHT AFTER A LONG
ON-AIR EXCHANGE WITH LAURA.

28:10.820 --> 28:12.242
THE TECH LAB GUYS
JUST MATCHED

28:12.290 --> 28:15.009
THE GRAVELLY VOICE FROM
THE RECORDING OF CROCK'S MURDER

28:15.060 --> 28:16.789
WITH BOB'S VOICE
FROM A FEW WEEKS AGO.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.789
- THAT'S FANTASTIC.
SOMEWHERE IN BOB'S DELUDED MIND,

28:19.830 --> 28:20.819
HE THOUGHT HE'D HAVE
A CHANCE WITH LAURA

28:20.860 --> 28:22.953
IF HE ELIMINATED
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SHE ADORES,

28:23.000 --> 28:23.921
FIRST
BY KILLING CROCK. ..

28:23.970 --> 28:25.722
- THEN
BY TRYING TO KILL GUS.

28:25.770 --> 28:28.034
I BET YOU BOB WILL STRIKE AGAIN
THE NEXT TIME

28:28.070 --> 28:30.766
HE HEARS LAURA GUSHING
OVER SOMEONE--ANYONE ON-AIR.

28:30.810 --> 28:31.936
- A STING.

28:31.970 --> 28:33.801
- NO,
WE SHOULD SET A TRAP.

28:33.840 --> 28:36.001
- WE SHOULD CREATE A SITUATION
THAT SEEMS LIKE ONE THING,

28:36.040 --> 28:37.905
AND THEN...
[squeaks] SPIDER FLY.

28:37.950 --> 28:42.239
- BUT WHO DO WE USE
AS BAIT?

28:42.280 --> 28:44.043
- AWWWW...

28:44.090 --> 28:45.079
- YEEEAAAH.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.940
SANTA BARBARA,

28:46.990 --> 28:49.959
YOU ARE ENTERING
THE SMOOTH STORM.

28:49.990 --> 28:52.049
[thunder effects]
CAN LOVE LIGHTNING

28:52.090 --> 28:53.955
BE CAUGHT
IN A MAN BOTTLE?

28:54.000 --> 28:57.891
THE ANSWER WHEN WE RETURN
AI-TER THIS COMMERCIAL BREAK.

28:57.930 --> 28:59.397
[chuckles]

28:59.430 --> 29:01.898
- NICE.
- [sobbing] NO.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.829
NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!
I CAN'T DO IT.

29:04.870 --> 29:06.963
THE MAN IS A LIVING
COMIC BOOK VILLAIN, SHAWN!

29:07.010 --> 29:07.977
- I KNOW,
IT'S RIDICULOUS,

29:08.010 --> 29:09.329
BUT YOU GOTTA RELAX.

29:09.380 --> 29:10.972
YOU'RE WEARING
A BULLETPROOF VEST.

29:11.010 --> 29:13.046
WE GOT YOU COVERED HERE.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, LASSIE?

29:13.080 --> 29:15.014
- WELL, YEAH, PROVIDED
GUSTER STICKS TO THE PLAN

29:15.050 --> 29:16.779
AND DOESN'T SCREW UP.

29:16.820 --> 29:18.014
WE GOT THE PERIMETER
OF THE STATION MONITORED,

29:18.050 --> 29:19.187
AND THE PHONE LINES
ARE TAPPED.

29:19.220 --> 29:21.450
WE'LL GET THIS BASTARD.
- YOU SEE?

29:21.490 --> 29:23.014
YOU ARE SAFE
AND SOUND.

29:23.060 --> 29:24.925
NOW, REMEMBER,
WHEN LAURA CALLS IN,

29:24.960 --> 29:27.178
YOU KEEP HER ON THE LINE
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.

29:27.230 --> 29:29.858
YOU MAKE IT HOT,
YOU MAKE IT WET,

29:29.900 --> 29:31.128
YOU MAKE IT SMOOTH.

29:31.170 --> 29:34.298
- HOT, WET, AND SMOOTH.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.399
WE GOTTA GET BOB ALL RILED UP,
SO HE TRIES TO KILL YOU AGAIN.

29:36.440 --> 29:38.101
- YOU'RE NOT HELPING,
SHAWN!

29:38.140 --> 29:41.576
- WE'RE BACK IN FIVE,
FOUR, THREE--

29:41.610 --> 29:44.408
- [laughs]

29:44.450 --> 29:46.099
AND THE ANSWER
IS IN.

29:46.150 --> 29:49.313
LOVE LIGHTNING CAN BE CAUGHT
IN A MAN BOTTLE,

29:49.350 --> 29:53.480
AND THE LABEL READS,
"A PLAYER NAMED GUS."

29:53.520 --> 29:56.956
SO CALL IF YOU'VE GOT
A STORY OF ELECTRIC LOVE.

29:56.990 --> 29:59.083
- THAT'S OUR CUE.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.052
[dials on phone]

30:01.100 --> 30:03.193
- WE HAVE LAURA
ON LINE ONE.

30:03.230 --> 30:05.095
- THIS IS GO TIME.

30:05.130 --> 30:07.860
- I DON'T HAVE
A STORY OF ELECTRIC LOVE,

30:07.900 --> 30:10.869
BUT I DO HAVE
A FANTASY OF ONE...

30:10.910 --> 30:13.470
WITH YOU, A PLAYER NAMED GUS.
[glggleSI

30:13.510 --> 30:15.933
- OHH, BABY!

30:15.980 --> 30:20.974
WELL, A PLAYER NAMED GUS HAS
100,000 VOLTS OF LOVE FOR YOU,

30:21.020 --> 30:25.480
AND MY CURRENTS RUN DEEP,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

30:25.520 --> 30:26.839
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:26.890 --> 30:28.312
- REALLY, SHAWN?

30:28.360 --> 30:30.578
YOU'RE GONNA CHOOSE NOW
TO SOMETHING ABOUT ANYTHING?

30:30.620 --> 30:35.091
- WELL, WHEN CAN I SEE YOU, SO
WE CAN BLOW UP THE POWER GRID?

30:35.130 --> 30:38.964
- YEAH, I'M, UH, JUST--
I'M GOING TO ANOTHER ROOM.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.458
- SOMEBODY CALL CON EDISON
AND PREPARE FOR A BLACKOUT

30:42.500 --> 30:44.502
'CAUSE A PLAYER NAMED GUS
AND LAURA

30:44.540 --> 30:47.168
ARE GONNA MAKE THE LIGHTS GO OUT
IN THIS CITY.

30:47.210 --> 30:52.978
AWWWW, YEEEAAAH.

30:53.010 --> 30:55.979
- HEY,
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.079
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S HELPING
WITH A POLICE STING.

30:58.120 --> 31:01.089
- HE DIDN'T MENTION ANYTHING
TO ME ABOUT A STING.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.348
- OBVIOUSLY,
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS

31:02.390 --> 31:04.028
HE HASN'T MENTIONED
TO YOU.

31:04.060 --> 31:05.925
- [scoffs]
- HEY!

31:05.960 --> 31:07.928
I JUST SAID
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.

31:07.960 --> 31:10.656
- OH, YOU DIDN'T.
- OH, YES, I DID.

31:10.700 --> 31:12.167
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

31:12.200 --> 31:13.360
_ OH--
- WHAT?

31:13.400 --> 31:15.061
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

31:15.100 --> 31:16.237
- OH, MISSY, NO.
I'M GOING TO PUSH YOU BACK.

31:16.270 --> 31:22.937
- MAKE A WISH!
[cow bell taps]

31:22.980 --> 31:24.402
- OH!
- HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!

31:24.450 --> 31:26.509
RACHAEL!
WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU?

31:26.550 --> 31:29.269
- [sighs] I KNOW
I SAID I WAS OKAY,

31:29.320 --> 31:31.083
AND I'M ABSOLUTELY
NOT FREAKING OUT,

31:31.120 --> 31:33.338
BUT I'M NOT OKAY,
AND THAT'S WHY I CAME DOWN HERE.

31:33.390 --> 31:35.119
I'M NERVOUS
AND CLEARLY A LITTLE JEALOUS,

31:35.160 --> 31:36.582
ESPECIALLY
IF THIS MAN-EATING TROLLOP

31:36.620 --> 31:38.383
TRIES TO SHOPLII-T YOU
THE SECOND I BOARD THAT PLANE!

31:38.430 --> 31:40.182
- WHAT DID SHE JUST CALL ME?
- LADIES,

31:40.230 --> 31:42.152
THIS IS NOT THE WAY
TO HANDLE THIS.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.191
RACHAEL, YOU ARE BRITISH
AND SOPHISTICATED.

31:44.230 --> 31:45.663
MIRANDA,
YOU ARE RICH

31:45.700 --> 31:48.533
AND. . .GOSH!
BUT LOOK,

31:48.570 --> 31:50.390
AS MUCH AS THIS WOULD CHECK
AN ITEM OFF OF MY BUCKET LIST,

31:50.440 --> 31:52.169
YOU TWO CANNOT FIGHT.

31:52.210 --> 31:54.178
- I JUST HAVE MORE TO SAY,
AND I THINK,

31:54.210 --> 31:56.098
IF I DON'T LAY IT OUT,
I DON'T BELIEVE WE'LL MAKE IT,

31:56.140 --> 31:58.040
AND I SO BADLY WANT US
TO MAKE IT, GUS.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.344
- ME TOO, BOO,
AND WE'LL TALK, I PROMISE,

32:00.380 --> 32:02.018
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I HAVE TO GO

32:02.050 --> 32:03.574
FLIRT MY BUTT OFF
WITH SOME WHITE WOMEN

32:03.620 --> 32:05.588
AND GET A COMIC BOOK VILLAIN
TO SHOOT ME.

32:05.620 --> 32:11.024
PLAY NICE.

32:11.060 --> 32:13.119
- GUYS, WE HAVE BOB
ON LINE ONE.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.492
- BE TOUGH, MAN.
DON'T BE WEEPY-BOY SANTOS.

32:15.530 --> 32:16.997
- ALL RIGHT, GUSTER,
KEEP HIM ON THE LINE.

32:17.030 --> 32:18.668
WE NEED 30 SECONDS MORE
FOR THE TRACE.

32:18.700 --> 32:22.739
- AWWWW, YEEEAAAH,
BOB.

32:22.770 --> 32:26.103
TELL A PLAYER NAMED GUS
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND.

32:26.140 --> 32:29.598
- I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO YOU
TRYING TO SMOOTH-TALK LAURA.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.676
SHE DOESN'T WANT
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

32:31.710 --> 32:32.972
- KEEP HIM TALKING.
WE ALMOST GOT HIM.

32:33.010 --> 32:37.640
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, BOB.
CALM DOWN.

32:37.680 --> 32:39.614
I THINK
LAURA HAS MADE IT CLEAR

32:39.650 --> 32:42.312
THE KIND OF PERSON SHE WANTS
AND WHO SHE DOESN'T.

32:42.360 --> 32:45.488
- OOH-OOH!

32:45.530 --> 32:47.998
- ALMOST THERE.

32:48.030 --> 32:50.294
GOT HIM.

32:50.330 --> 32:55.165
OH, NO.

32:55.200 --> 32:57.668
[phone ringing]

32:57.700 --> 32:59.759
- O'HARA.
- O'HARA, WE TRACED BOB'S CALL.

32:59.810 --> 33:01.630
HE'S HEADED TOWARDS YOU.
WE GOT IT WRONG.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.136
HE'S MAKING HIS MOVE
AGAINST LAURA.

33:03.180 --> 33:06.047
- GOT IT.

33:06.080 --> 33:07.547
OKAY, BOB'S NEARBY.

33:07.580 --> 33:08.717
- [whines]

33:08.750 --> 33:19.058
- STAY PUT.

33:19.090 --> 33:29.136
[glass breaking]

33:29.140 --> 33:41.416
[glass breaking]

33:41.450 --> 33:44.419
UGH!

33:47.120 --> 33:48.382
- SO YOU GOT THAT?
COOL.

33:48.420 --> 33:50.809
- JULES!
OH, DEAR, DEAR GOODNESS.

33:50.860 --> 33:52.555
ARE YOU OKAY?
- WHAT?

33:52.590 --> 33:54.820
- HERE, SIT. SIT IN THIS CHAIR,
IT HAS A CUSHION.

33:54.860 --> 33:59.160
LOOK,
I...AM...HERE...

33:59.200 --> 34:01.498
FOR...YOU.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.394
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU THINK I HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE?

34:03.440 --> 34:04.759
- THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
THAT YOU DO,

34:04.810 --> 34:06.607
BUT I WILL NOT
ABANDON YOU.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.505
- WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE A SEAT, MISS?

34:08.540 --> 34:10.098
WE FOUND HER
ABOUT TH REE BLOCKS AWAY,

34:10.140 --> 34:12.608
HIDING IN SOME BUSHES.
SHE RAN OUT THE BACK DOOR.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.174
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY,
O'HARA?

34:14.220 --> 34:15.346
- OH, CONSIDERING I LET THE GUY
GET THE JUMP ON ME,

34:15.380 --> 34:16.745
OH, YEAH,
I'M JUST ACES.

34:16.780 --> 34:18.441
- OH, DON'T BE
SO HARD ON YOURSELF.

34:18.490 --> 34:20.481
WE'VE ALL HAD OUR CLOCKS CLEANED
BY A PERP AT LEAST ONCE.

34:20.520 --> 34:21.782
EXCEPT FOR ME,
OF COURSE.

34:21.820 --> 34:23.117
- LASSIE!
- DUDE.

34:23.160 --> 34:24.582
- DID YOU I.D.
YOUR ASSAILANT?

34:24.630 --> 34:27.281
- WAS IT BOB?
- THE PERP HIT ME FROM BEHIND.

34:27.330 --> 34:28.729
I DIDN'T GET
A FACE.

34:28.760 --> 34:29.727
- I JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND
HOW HE GOT

34:29.760 --> 34:31.318
THROUGH THAT LITTLE WINDOW.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.122
YOU'RE SURE YOU LOCKED DOWN
THE ENTIRE HOUSE?

34:33.170 --> 34:34.637
- OF COURSE I DID!
I'M NOT A TOTAL MORON.

34:34.670 --> 34:45.478
- AND EVEN IF YOU WERE,
I WOULD CLEAN UP YOUR MESSES.

34:45.510 --> 34:47.569
GUS, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
IN THE BATHROOM.

34:47.610 --> 34:49.168
- WHAT? YOU MUST BE
OUT OF YOUR DAMN MIND.

34:49.220 --> 34:50.414
- DUDE, I JUST NEED
YOUR EXPERTISE FOR A SECOND.

34:50.450 --> 34:51.781
NOW, COME ON.
- I DON'T CARE.

34:51.820 --> 34:53.310
STAND IF IT'S ONE,
SIT IF IT'S TWO.

34:53.350 --> 34:54.851
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE GETTING
FROM ME, SHAWN.

34:54.890 --> 34:56.312
- I DON'T NEED TO USE
THE BATHROOM, JUST--

34:56.360 --> 34:57.657
- I'M NOT GOING TO THE BATHROOM
WITH YOU.

34:57.690 --> 34:59.351
[overlapping bickering]
- I DON'T CARE.

34:59.390 --> 35:00.721
- I CAN'T HAVE THIS CONVERSATION
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY!

35:00.760 --> 35:03.194
- THAT'S--THAT'S--
FINE!

35:03.230 --> 35:07.166
EXCUSE ME.

35:07.200 --> 35:11.762
MAN, THIS IS WEIRD, SHAWN,
EVEN FOR YOU.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.176
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- WHAT?

35:14.210 --> 35:16.178
- WE DIDN'T REALLY COME UP HERE
TO CROSS STREAMS, GUS.

35:16.210 --> 35:17.700
I HAVE A HUNCH.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.173
- OH.

35:19.210 --> 35:20.507
- YOU THINK WE'RE
BACK AT CAMP TIKI-HAMA?

35:20.550 --> 35:22.370
COME ON, SON.

35:22.420 --> 35:25.685
WHOA.
- DUDE.

35:25.720 --> 35:28.553
- LAURA'S AN ADDICT, GUS,
A REAL PILL POPPER.

35:28.590 --> 35:29.682
I WONDER WHAT ELSE
SHE'S INVOLVED IN.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.483
MURDER, PERHAPS?

35:31.530 --> 35:33.327
- THESE DRUGS
AREN'T RECREATIONAL, SHAWN.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.896
- YOU CAN'T TAKE THESE
IN A PARK OR AN ARCADE?

35:34.930 --> 35:36.693
- TH ESE ARE
ANTIDEPRESSANTS,

35:36.730 --> 35:38.789
MOOD STABILIZERS,
ANTI PSYCHOTICS.

35:38.830 --> 35:40.764
THESE ARE
FOR A SERIOUS CONDITION.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.893
- WHAT CONDITION?

35:42.940 --> 35:45.932
JULES!
OH, JULES.

35:45.970 --> 35:48.530
JULES, CAN YOU UNDERSTAND ME,
SWEETHEART?

35:48.580 --> 35:51.902
WERE YOU WITH LAURA WHEN SHE
CALLED IN TO GUS'S RADIO SHOW?

35:51.950 --> 35:54.418
- NO, I WAS RECHECKING
ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS.

35:54.450 --> 35:56.475
- AND WHERE WAS LAURA
WHEN YOU WERE ATTACKED

35:56.520 --> 35:58.249
AND ALMOST TURNED
INTO A DELIGHTFUL DIMWIT

35:58.290 --> 35:59.917
WITH NO CONTROL
OVER YOUR FACULTIES?

35:59.950 --> 36:01.952
- UH, SHE WAS
IN THE NEXT ROOM.

36:01.990 --> 36:03.855
- WELL, I'M SENSING
THAT CROCK'S KILLER,

36:03.890 --> 36:08.589
WHO IS ALSO JULIET'S ATTACKER,
IS RIGHT HERE IN THIS ROOM.

36:08.630 --> 36:11.269
- THAT'S WHAT YOU TWO NIMRODS
CAME UP WITH IN THE CRAPPER?

36:11.300 --> 36:12.392
THAT THE PERP
IS ONE OF US?

36:12.430 --> 36:14.569
- NOT ONE OF US.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.591
ONE OF HER.

36:16.640 --> 36:17.789
- LAURA?
- YUP.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.307
- LAURA IS BOB,
AND BOB IS LAURA,

36:19.340 --> 36:20.739
AND WHO KNOWS
HOW MANY OTHER PERSONALITIES

36:20.770 --> 36:22.829
YOU HAVE SWIMMING AROUND
IN YOUR CUTE BUT CRAZY,

36:22.880 --> 36:25.747
AIMEE MANN-LOOKING FACE.
AM I RIGHT?

36:25.780 --> 36:29.375
- YES AND NO. YES,
I'VE HAD PROBLEMS IN THE PAST,

36:29.420 --> 36:31.308
BUT I TAKE MY MEDS
RELIGIOUSLY.

36:31.350 --> 36:33.489
I'M IN A REALLY GOOD PLACE.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.215
- MAYBE LAURA'S
IN A GOOD PLACE,

36:35.260 --> 36:36.887
BUT BOB
IS AN ELI ROTH MOVIE.

36:36.920 --> 36:38.456
HE FLIPPED
AND KILLED CROCK,

36:38.490 --> 36:40.321
AND HE DID IT ALL
ON THE CHEAP IN ROMANIA.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.897
- THERE IS A BOB!
A REAL BOB!

36:42.930 --> 36:44.420
- YEAH,
AND PIGS FLY.

36:44.470 --> 36:45.425
- I KNEW IT!

36:45.470 --> 36:46.494
- WHAT?
- LOOK.

36:46.530 --> 36:48.339
AS FAR AS CROCK KNEW,

36:48.370 --> 36:50.463
IT WAS LAURA WHO CAME
TO THE STUDIO THAT DAY.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.899
HE HAD NO REASON
TO BE ALARMED.

36:51.940 --> 36:53.464
IT WAS JUST A VISIT
FROM HIS NUMBER ONE FAN

36:53.510 --> 36:56.229
WHO HE USED TO MAKE
THE SPANKY-TANK-PANK DANCE WITH,

36:56.280 --> 36:57.975
BUT THAT DAY,
YOU WERE BOB,

36:58.010 --> 37:00.501
AND BOB WAS JEALOUS OF LAURA'S
RELATIONSHIP WITH CROCK,

37:00.550 --> 37:01.710
SO HE KILLED HIM.

37:01.750 --> 37:03.012
- HEY! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU--?

37:03.050 --> 37:04.688
NO! PLEASE, DON'T!

37:04.720 --> 37:07.814
NO!
[gunshots]

37:07.850 --> 37:10.819
- IT WAS YOU, AS BOB, WHO
CALLED IN TO GUS'S RADIO SHOW,

37:10.860 --> 37:13.829
WHICH IS WHY LASSITER TRACED
THE CALL BACK TO THIS AREA.

37:13.860 --> 37:17.296
AND IT WAS YOU, AS BOB,
WHO ATTACKED JULIET,

37:17.330 --> 37:19.389
TRIED TO TURN HER
INTO THE OTHER SISTER.

37:19.430 --> 37:21.864
- LAURA, BOB,
WHOEVER ELSE IS IN THERE,

37:21.900 --> 37:23.367
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO HEAD DOWN TO THE STATION

37:23.400 --> 37:27.564
BEFORE WE CAN CLEAR THIS UP.
- LET'S GO.

37:27.610 --> 37:30.579
- PHEW!

37:30.610 --> 37:34.944
- WHAT?

37:34.980 --> 37:38.040
I HAVE TO SAY, THESE LAST
TWO DAYS IN OUR RELATIONSHIP

37:38.080 --> 37:39.809
WERE PRETTY ROUGH.
- WELL,

37:39.850 --> 37:41.909
I GUESS WE BOTH
FLIPPED OUT A BIT, DIDN'T WE?

37:41.960 --> 37:43.552
- YEAH.

37:43.590 --> 37:44.887
- BUT WE CAN HANDLE
THIS SEPARATION THING, RIGHT?

37:44.930 --> 37:47.751
- OH, YEAH.
DEFINITELY.

37:47.790 --> 37:50.850
DON'T YOU THINK?
- ABSOLUTELY, YES. NO DOUBT.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.959
[car horn honks]

37:53.000 --> 37:57.460
WELL, THAT'S MY TAXI.
- YEAH.

37:57.500 --> 38:00.003
LOOK,
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

38:00.040 --> 38:04.545
I'M SO HAPPY FOR THESE LAST
FEW MONTHS I'VE HAD WITH YOU.

38:04.580 --> 38:07.799
AND TRUST ME,

38:07.850 --> 38:17.885
I WILL COUNT DOWN THE NEXT
SIX MONTHS LIKE A STOPWATCH.

38:17.890 --> 38:22.953
I WILL COUNT DOWN THE NEXT
SIX MONTHS LIKE A STOPWATCH.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.960
UM, CALL ME WHEN YOU LAND,
SO I KNOW YOU GOT THERE SAFELY.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.968
- EXCEPT IT WILL BE IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THERE.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.504
OH, YEAH. WELL,
SEND ME A TEXT, OR EMAIL ME.

38:33.540 --> 38:35.474
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU GET THE CHANCE.

38:35.510 --> 38:37.603
- I WILL.

38:37.640 --> 38:40.643
I'LL SEE YOU
IN SIX MONTHS.

38:40.680 --> 38:53.423
- I'LL BE HERE.

38:53.460 --> 39:00.525
[knocking at the door]

39:00.570 --> 39:01.537
[whimpers]

39:01.570 --> 39:04.801
BOB?

39:04.840 --> 39:07.104
UGH!

39:09.780 --> 39:11.839
- O'HARA, SO HERE'S
SOME STRANGE NEWS.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.040
I SPOKE WITH LAURA'S DOCTOR,
WHO SAID

39:13.080 --> 39:14.945
SHE'S ACTUALLY DOING
REALLY WELL.

39:14.980 --> 39:16.470
THE MEDS HAVE BEEN WORKING,
AND NO OTHER PERSONALITIES

39:16.520 --> 39:17.873
HAVE SURFACED
IN OVER TWO YEARS.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.911
- HMM.
- MAYBE THERE REALLY IS A BOB.

39:19.950 --> 39:22.510
- TWO YEARS?

39:22.560 --> 39:25.950
GUS WAS SUPPOSED TO CALL ME
WHEN HE GOT HOME.

39:25.990 --> 39:31.428
HE HASN'T CALLED.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.961
- LAURA WAS TELLING THE TRUTH
ABOUT HAVING A STALKER?

39:34.000 --> 39:36.059
- STALKER?
I LOVE HER.

39:36.100 --> 39:39.604
SHE JUST CAN'T SEE IT 'CAUSE
PEOPLE KEEP GETTING IN THE WAY.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.039
- YOU KILLED CROCK,

39:41.070 --> 39:43.174
AND THEN YOU TOOK A SHOT AT ME
AT THE STATION!

39:43.210 --> 39:44.905
- YOU'RE JUST FIGURING
THIS OUT?

39:44.950 --> 39:46.747
- BREAKING DOWN A CASE
IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS!

39:46.780 --> 39:48.577
I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER STUFF
THAT HAPPENED DAYS AGO

39:48.620 --> 39:50.144
AND KEEP TRACK
OF WHAT'S GOING ON NOW.

39:50.180 --> 39:52.011
- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TRIED
TO TAKE LAURA FROM ME.

39:52.050 --> 39:53.881
- I WASN'T TRYING
TO TAKE YOUR GIRL, MAN!

39:53.920 --> 39:54.955
I ALREADY
HAVE A GIRL.

39:54.990 --> 39:57.185
PLEASE, I HEARD YOU TALK
ABOUT THAT ON THE RADIO.

39:57.220 --> 39:59.859
LIKE THAT'S GONNA LAST
THE SIX MONTHS.

39:59.890 --> 40:00.686
[knocking at the door]

40:00.730 --> 40:02.698
- NO DOUBT
THAT IS THE POLICE, BOB.

40:02.730 --> 40:03.958
IT'S TIME
TO GIVE IT UP.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.764
- GUS, I HAPPENED TO BE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD--

40:06.800 --> 40:09.667
[gaSPSI

40:09.700 --> 40:11.133
- WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

40:11.170 --> 40:13.900
- SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY.
- WHAT?

40:13.940 --> 40:15.532
- INDIAN GIRL'S
ON THE PLANE, RIGHT?

40:15.580 --> 40:17.935
- OH, MY GOSH!
YOU NEED JESUS.

40:17.980 --> 40:20.744
- THAT WOULD
KIND OF RUIN THE MOOD.

40:20.780 --> 40:22.213
- UGH!

40:22.250 --> 40:24.616

40:24.650 --> 40:26.743
- I SEE YOU, BOB.

40:26.790 --> 40:29.054
YOU ARE
UNDERAPPRECIATED.

40:29.090 --> 40:31.012
GOD, YOU'RE HUGE.

40:31.060 --> 40:33.028
- STOP TALKING.
- I CAN'T.

40:33.060 --> 40:34.027
- I SAID SHUT UP!
- [screams]

40:34.060 --> 40:35.220
- THAT'S ENOUGH, BOB!

40:35.260 --> 40:40.698
[urgent knocking at the door]
- [gaSPSI

40:40.730 --> 40:43.836

40:43.870 --> 40:46.703

HEY, HEY, HEY!

40:46.740 --> 40:49.129
YOU DID GOOD, PLAYA.

40:49.180 --> 40:58.919
- AWWWW, YEEEAAAH.

40:58.950 --> 41:01.680
- WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU AND MAX LANDED SAFELY.

41:01.720 --> 41:03.483
DID HE GET THE SURPRISE
I LEI-T IN HIS BAG?

41:03.520 --> 41:05.659
- NOT YET.
HE SLEPT MOST OF THE FLIGHT.

41:05.690 --> 41:08.853
- OH. OH, WAIT
TILL I TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED.

41:08.900 --> 41:13.121
- [gasps] DADDY!
YOU SURPRISED US!

41:13.170 --> 41:16.594

SPENDING TIME WITH YOU, RIGHT?

41:19.570 --> 41:24.075
