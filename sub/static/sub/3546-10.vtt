WEBVTT

00:00.731 --> 00:02.249
Previously on...

00:02.273 --> 00:04.580
Did you leave the door open?
Call the police!

00:04.605 --> 00:06.053
Is that the guy
who broke into your house?

00:06.077 --> 00:07.184
Arrests were made...

00:07.208 --> 00:08.255
Yeah, that's him.

00:08.279 --> 00:09.256
I just want a chance

00:09.280 --> 00:10.417
to get to know you.

00:10.441 --> 00:11.758
I don't want to know you.

00:11.782 --> 00:13.120
Fathers were confronted...

00:13.144 --> 00:15.122
Who's sister Mary Bernard?

00:15.146 --> 00:16.463
You do not want to
start a war with me.

00:16.487 --> 00:17.764
Bring it on.

00:17.788 --> 00:19.166
Boundaries were drawn...

00:19.190 --> 00:21.668
Mr. Williams was responsible
for your husband's death.

00:21.692 --> 00:24.036
And everyone learned
that sometimes

00:24.060 --> 00:25.072
justice is served...

00:25.096 --> 00:26.373
We need to call an ambulance.

00:26.397 --> 00:29.097
Without saying a word.

00:32.262 --> 00:34.090
There were many ways to tell

00:34.114 --> 00:36.513
Bree Van De Kamp was a lady.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.014
Thank you very much.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.047
She was courteous to those
around her,

00:40.071 --> 00:43.450
she moved with elegance
and grace

00:43.474 --> 00:47.023
and she was very careful
to never let others know

00:47.047 --> 00:49.056
what she was thinking.

00:49.080 --> 00:52.659
Mrs. Van De Kamp, thank you
for coming on such short notice.

00:52.683 --> 00:54.301
So what's happened?

00:54.325 --> 00:56.163
Have you had any luck
finding George?

00:56.187 --> 00:58.365
You see, like most
well-bred women...

00:58.389 --> 01:00.437
George is dead.

01:00.461 --> 01:03.240
He committed suicide
last night at a hotel.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.041
Bree had something to hide.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.375
Oh, um...

01:08.399 --> 01:15.452
Well, um, it was very good of
you to tell me in person, truly.

01:15.476 --> 01:20.187
Actually, uh, there's more.

01:20.211 --> 01:22.151
More?

01:24.115 --> 01:26.593
Do you recognize this?

01:26.617 --> 01:30.197
Those are my panties.
How did you...

01:30.221 --> 01:32.499
We assume Mr. Williams
stole them.

01:32.523 --> 01:34.171
Where did you find them?

01:34.195 --> 01:39.406
Mr. Williams had a room filled
with, um... Unsavory items.

01:39.430 --> 01:41.748
It was like a shrine.

01:41.772 --> 01:44.616
"Unsavory items"?
Well, what does that mean?

01:44.640 --> 01:45.852
You don't want to know.

01:45.876 --> 01:47.814
Just so you're aware,
the "daily tribune"

01:47.838 --> 01:49.456
is starting to sniff around
this story.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.458
The editor's a good friend
of mine.

01:51.482 --> 01:53.290
I'm pretty sure I can quash it,

01:53.314 --> 01:55.201
but you might want to tell
your family what's going on,

01:55.225 --> 01:57.294
just in case.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.466
What is that?

01:59.490 --> 02:01.428
I am so sorry. You weren't
supposed to see that.

02:01.452 --> 02:03.200
Mudge, get that out of here.

02:03.224 --> 02:07.234
No, wait!
Is that supposed to be me?

02:07.258 --> 02:08.358
Well...

02:10.201 --> 02:13.740
It's hard to say.

02:13.764 --> 02:15.111
I don't understand.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.844
I mean, what would George
be doing with a life-size doll?

02:20.541 --> 02:23.250
Oh, dear lord.

02:23.274 --> 02:25.222
Go ahead.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.224
Oh, hold it. What are
you gonna do with that?

02:27.248 --> 02:29.756
Well, until we close
the file on Mr. Williams,

02:29.780 --> 02:31.258
she's considered evidence.

02:31.282 --> 02:33.730
We'll have to take her back
to the station.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.268
I am so sorry about this,
Mrs. Van De Kamp.

02:36.292 --> 02:38.227
I know how difficult
all this must be.

02:41.392 --> 02:44.279
Don't you worry about me,
detective barton.

02:44.303 --> 02:47.544
I will be just fine.

02:47.568 --> 02:51.818
Yes, there were many ways
to tell that Bree was a lady,

02:51.842 --> 02:55.289
but the surest was to watch
how she maintained her dignity

02:55.313 --> 03:00.206
in even the most undignified
of situations.

03:05.686 --> 03:11.167
It's a story as old
as time itself...

03:11.191 --> 03:15.331
The return of the prodigal son.

03:17.268 --> 03:21.398
And no matter how many times
it's repeated...

03:23.704 --> 03:26.514
Or how the details might vary...

03:28.239 --> 03:31.718
Or how the names might change...

03:31.742 --> 03:34.722
The story always ends
the same way...

03:36.517 --> 03:41.898
In the tender embrace
of a loving father.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.552
Hi, dad.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.880
Susan Mayer told me she gave
you some money to go to Utah.

03:53.904 --> 03:56.518
Yeah, I had no idea
where to look for you, though,

03:56.542 --> 03:58.385
and the money started
to run out,

03:58.409 --> 03:59.846
so I thought that maybe
you'd come back here.

03:59.870 --> 04:01.318
You're a smart kid.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.849
Can I ask you something?

04:02.873 --> 04:05.283
Of course. Anything.

04:07.378 --> 04:11.998
Well, when you left town,
Mrs. Tillman said

04:12.022 --> 04:15.592
that my real mother was
a junkie from Utah.

04:19.630 --> 04:21.968
That's right.

04:21.992 --> 04:25.272
So...

04:25.296 --> 04:26.836
Who's my dad?

04:30.871 --> 04:34.481
I don't know.
It could have been anyone.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.664
Thanks for the faucet.
This leak is driving me crazy.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.536
What do I owe you?

04:49.560 --> 04:52.038
Oh, it's no rush.
Just pay me when I install it.

04:52.062 --> 04:55.041
Hey, there!

04:55.065 --> 04:57.504
Have you seen today's paper?

04:57.528 --> 04:59.346
No, not yet.

04:59.370 --> 05:02.809
Ohh. There's a follow-up on that
guy you caught last week.

05:02.833 --> 05:05.487
"Police seek help
in identifying mystery vagrant."

05:05.511 --> 05:07.384
They don't know
the man's name yet?

05:07.408 --> 05:09.456
They're not even sure
that he knows how to talk.

05:09.480 --> 05:12.319
Think they're going to hold him
in the psych ward

05:12.343 --> 05:13.720
until they figure out who he is.

05:13.744 --> 05:16.393
Well, I will certainly
rest easier

05:16.417 --> 05:18.795
knowing that he's not
roaming around our neighborhood.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.019
See you!

05:22.353 --> 05:24.331
Thanks again for the faucet.

05:24.355 --> 05:26.395
Sure.

05:30.701 --> 05:33.440
What are we gonna do
about Caleb?

05:33.464 --> 05:37.674
Obviously, we are going
to go and get him.

05:47.017 --> 05:49.325
Where are my cuffs?

05:49.349 --> 05:52.629
Bottom drawer. Ah.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.010
So when do I tell people
you'll be back?

05:55.034 --> 05:57.485
Couple, maybe three days.

05:59.660 --> 06:03.410
What the hell's this?

06:03.434 --> 06:05.751
It's the ball gag.
I thought you wanted it.

06:05.775 --> 06:08.545
We do not recycle ball gags.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.677
Take a look at the teeth marks.

06:10.701 --> 06:13.780
It's gross.

06:13.804 --> 06:16.791
I'd like to think
that we're better than that.

06:16.815 --> 06:19.626
Hey, Monroe?

06:19.650 --> 06:21.688
You sure you don't want
any help?

06:21.712 --> 06:23.960
The guy's dangerous.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.463
He's a half-wit, Jerry.

06:26.487 --> 06:29.817
If I can handle you,
I can handle him.

06:32.723 --> 06:35.472
So he poisoned Rex?

06:35.496 --> 06:37.704
Sweet, little George Williams.

06:37.728 --> 06:40.577
Well, it turns out he wasn't
so sweet after all.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.108
Anyway, there's a chance

06:42.132 --> 06:43.650
that some of this
may wind up in the paper,

06:43.674 --> 06:45.891
so I wanted you to hear it
from me first.

06:45.915 --> 06:47.884
Bree, I'm so sorry.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.817
Yeah, like you haven't
been through enough.

06:50.841 --> 06:52.789
God, and he's our pharmacist.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.800
It's enough
to turn you holistic.

06:54.824 --> 06:56.493
I know this sounds awful,

06:56.517 --> 06:58.495
but I'm kind of glad
the guy's dead.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.027
Oh, I hope
that little creep suffered.

07:01.051 --> 07:03.821
Well, we'll never know.

07:09.059 --> 07:12.408
That's Andrew back from
camp hennessey. I've got to go.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.510
Does he know yet?

07:13.534 --> 07:15.442
He hasn't got a clue.

07:15.466 --> 07:16.883
How do you think
he's gonna react?

07:16.907 --> 07:20.817
All right,
what the hell is going on?

07:20.841 --> 07:23.811
I know you didn't take me
out of kid jail for my health.

07:25.716 --> 07:29.676
I'll get back to you later.

07:34.925 --> 07:36.563
So are the police sure?

07:36.587 --> 07:40.607
Yeah. They found data
in George's personal computer

07:40.631 --> 07:43.439
and also records at his pharmacy

07:43.463 --> 07:47.020
that pretty much proves that
he was poisoning your father.

07:47.044 --> 07:50.137
Did they say why he killed him?

07:52.573 --> 07:54.626
Well, the detective seems
to think he was trying

07:54.650 --> 07:56.883
to get your father
out of the way so...

07:56.907 --> 07:58.507
He could marry me.

08:01.512 --> 08:03.660
Honey, please use your coaster.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.461
That's gonna leave a ring.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.764
My father was murdered
because of you,

08:07.788 --> 08:09.465
so as far as I'm concerned,

08:09.489 --> 08:11.868
you no longer get to
tell me what to do.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.469
Andrew, that is not fair.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.642
You brought that psycho
into our house!

08:15.666 --> 08:16.873
You sat him down at our table.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.605
Just how fair do you
expect me to be?

08:18.629 --> 08:20.507
Andrew, George Williams
fooled a lot of people.

08:20.531 --> 08:22.148
Yeah, well, he didn't fool me.

08:22.172 --> 08:26.553
Andrew, I'm not trying
to minimize my part in this.

08:26.577 --> 08:29.255
Believe me, I hate myself
for what's happened.

08:29.279 --> 08:33.219
Good. Now we have something
in common.

08:33.243 --> 08:34.890
Oh, by the way,

08:34.914 --> 08:36.722
I'm gonna call my friend Justin

08:36.746 --> 08:38.865
and have him come over
and spend the night tonight.

08:38.889 --> 08:42.729
Justin? Is he a friend of yours
from school or church?

08:42.753 --> 08:44.230
What kind of friend is he?

08:44.254 --> 08:47.534
The real good kind.

08:49.529 --> 08:53.910
Andrew, it is inappropriate
for you to have somebody over.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.042
You just got home.

08:56.066 --> 08:57.544
Like I said,

08:57.568 --> 09:00.608
you don't get to tell me
what to do anymore.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.055
You came.

09:09.079 --> 09:10.627
Did I have a choice?

09:10.651 --> 09:12.599
Well, sure.

09:12.623 --> 09:14.100
Because at the hospital,

09:14.124 --> 09:16.608
you sounded like you were
fully prepared to blackmail me

09:16.632 --> 09:18.665
into having some kind
of a relationship with you.

09:18.689 --> 09:20.536
That was just the heat
of the moment,

09:20.560 --> 09:21.908
and once you get to know me,

09:21.932 --> 09:23.640
you'll understand that I am
not the kind of person

09:23.664 --> 09:25.647
who could ever,
ever resort to blackmail.

09:25.671 --> 09:28.174
Well, I wish you'd made that
clear in the hospital.

09:28.198 --> 09:30.176
Could have saved me a trip.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.978
So are you coming in?

09:32.002 --> 09:33.872
Well, I got a lunch hour
to kill.

09:40.150 --> 09:44.160
That was my first Halloween.
I was 2. What do you think I am?

09:44.184 --> 09:45.231
I don't know.

09:45.255 --> 09:47.333
Oh, come on, just guess.
You can tell.

09:47.357 --> 09:49.666
Uh, a homeless person?

09:49.690 --> 09:52.168
No, Addison, I'm a chicken.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.940
See? Those are feathers
hanging around.

09:53.964 --> 09:57.704
Oh. I thought that was
supposed to be trash.

09:57.728 --> 10:00.276
Uh, look, are we done here?

10:00.300 --> 10:02.679
You haven't even finished
your coffee.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.711
I got to get back to work.

10:04.735 --> 10:07.784
Oh, well, we... we haven't even
finished the high school years.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.056
I wanted to show you this one.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.058
This was from
the father-daughter dance.

10:12.082 --> 10:14.320
I had to take my mother's
hairstylist.

10:14.344 --> 10:17.894
What do you want from me, Susan?

10:17.918 --> 10:22.268
Well, I-I just want to share
more than our d.N.A.

10:22.292 --> 10:26.002
I... I wanted to have
a relationship with you.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.675
None of this
means anything to you?

10:28.699 --> 10:32.608
I'll take the hobo picture.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.983
Actually, it was... Fine.

10:37.007 --> 10:39.045
What's this?

10:39.069 --> 10:41.347
Our company insurance policy.
You ever bother to read it?

10:41.371 --> 10:43.149
I'm going to say no,
but don't tell.

10:43.173 --> 10:45.992
We have day care, ed, day care.

10:46.016 --> 10:48.655
Do you realize that since
we fired half the staff,

10:48.679 --> 10:51.227
you and I have barely
left the building?

10:51.251 --> 10:52.999
My kids are forgetting who I am.

10:53.023 --> 10:54.701
I hear you. I have 17-month-old

10:54.725 --> 10:56.362
who I haven't actually seen
awake in weeks.

10:56.386 --> 11:00.066
See? All we need is
a minimum participation

11:00.090 --> 11:03.409
of, uh... 16 kids.

11:03.433 --> 11:06.172
My kids, your baby,

11:06.196 --> 11:07.814
Sally in accounting has three,

11:07.838 --> 11:09.846
that new guy
in human resources has two

11:09.870 --> 11:12.318
and we hit the mother lode
with the mormon receptionist.

11:12.342 --> 11:15.682
She just popped out number 6.
There. 16.

11:15.706 --> 11:17.153
15. My wife won't do it.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.155
Well, maybe if I talked to her.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.157
No, I'm telling you, this
day care thing is a non-starter.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.730
Fran won't even let
anyone else hold the baby.

11:23.754 --> 11:26.367
Well, she won't just take some
time off for a couple of hours?

11:26.391 --> 11:28.364
Lynette, if I hadn't
cut that umbilical cord

11:28.388 --> 11:29.796
with my own two hands,

11:29.820 --> 11:32.699
I swear they would still
be attached.

11:32.723 --> 11:35.671
But if you want to try...

11:35.695 --> 11:37.865
More power to you.

11:45.736 --> 11:49.455
You! What the hell
did you do with my husband?!

11:49.479 --> 11:50.957
Please restrain yourself,
Gabrielle.

11:50.981 --> 11:52.819
You're in a house of god.

11:52.843 --> 11:54.761
Tell me where he is!

11:54.785 --> 11:56.763
Everywhere, of course.

11:56.787 --> 11:59.726
Not god, my husband.

11:59.750 --> 12:02.028
Gaby, what are you doing here?

12:02.052 --> 12:04.370
I was just about to ask you
the same thing.

12:04.394 --> 12:06.207
You were supposed to meet me
at the spa.

12:06.231 --> 12:07.804
I was just helping sister Mary

12:07.828 --> 12:09.776
with the mailings
for the fund-raiser.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.778
The church is about to send
a relief team to Botswana

12:11.802 --> 12:13.279
to help with the drought.

12:13.303 --> 12:14.781
That's your excuse?

12:14.805 --> 12:16.783
We missed side-by-side
water massages.

12:16.807 --> 12:18.745
I had to book them
weeks in advance.

12:18.769 --> 12:20.747
Okay, you missed a massage.

12:20.771 --> 12:24.150
It's unfortunate, but there
are people dying in Botswana.

12:24.174 --> 12:26.858
There are going to be
people dying in this church

12:26.882 --> 12:29.155
if you don't wipe that
patronizing look off your face!

12:29.179 --> 12:30.797
What is your problem?

12:30.821 --> 12:34.730
Sister Mary, will you
excuse us, please?

12:34.754 --> 12:37.064
Certainly.

12:39.329 --> 12:41.467
We are supposed to be working
on our marriage, Carlos,

12:41.491 --> 12:43.269
but we can't do that as long as

12:43.293 --> 12:45.516
our lady of perpetual
stick-up-her-butt

12:45.540 --> 12:47.914
has you worrying
about thirsty orphans.

12:47.938 --> 12:51.477
You're blaming sister Mary
for the tension in our marriage?

12:51.501 --> 12:52.919
She wants us fighting.

12:52.943 --> 12:54.821
She wants you to get tired of me

12:54.845 --> 12:56.322
and walk out so she can
have you all to herself.

12:56.346 --> 12:57.753
That's crazy. She's a nun.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.755
She may wear a habit
and the beads,

12:59.779 --> 13:01.257
but at the end of the day,

13:01.281 --> 13:03.259
she is still a woman,
just like me,

13:03.283 --> 13:04.760
and I know what I'm capable of.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.763
She is a woman...

13:07.787 --> 13:10.317
But she is nothing like you.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.503
Carlos, where are you going?

13:17.127 --> 13:19.027
Carlos!

13:20.971 --> 13:23.850
You look tense, Gabrielle.

13:23.874 --> 13:27.884
Perhaps you should think about
getting a massage.

13:39.890 --> 13:41.868
Hi, Susan, it's Addison.
Are you there?

13:41.892 --> 13:43.469
Hi. Hi, yeah, I'm here.

13:43.493 --> 13:44.831
Good. You're home.

13:44.855 --> 13:46.272
Uh-huh. What's up?

13:46.296 --> 13:48.975
You know you were saying you
wanted to be part of my life?

13:48.999 --> 13:50.076
Yeah.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.908
I'm at the police station.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.210
I need you to come bail me out.

13:54.234 --> 13:57.914
Solicitation? You were
arrested for solicitation?

13:57.938 --> 13:59.946
It was entrapment.
I'm the victim here.

13:59.970 --> 14:01.817
But you were with a prostitute.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.189
Apparently not.

14:03.213 --> 14:05.997
I asked her three times...
"are you a cop?"

14:06.021 --> 14:08.224
They got to tell you,
but she didn't say "boo."

14:08.248 --> 14:09.896
I thought this was america!

14:09.920 --> 14:12.999
Addison, you just got caught
paying for sex.

14:13.023 --> 14:14.910
Now is not the time to
wrap yourself in the flag.

14:14.934 --> 14:18.134
Don't give me that look. It
wasn't my fault. I'm sorry.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.566
How is trying to pick up
a hooker not your fault?

14:20.590 --> 14:23.369
I was at the store,
I was working on my computer

14:23.393 --> 14:25.476
and then, you know,
they have these ads?

14:25.500 --> 14:27.874
They pop up on the screen
and they ask if you want to

14:27.898 --> 14:29.375
have a hot date.

14:29.399 --> 14:31.077
Well, it gets a fellow
worked up.

14:31.101 --> 14:34.220
Can't you just go home
and have sex with your wife

14:34.244 --> 14:35.591
like a normal person?

14:35.615 --> 14:37.924
She's a 68-year-old woman.

14:37.948 --> 14:40.026
That bell stopped ringing
for me years ago.

14:40.050 --> 14:43.359
Oh, my god. Stop. Right now.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.263
I'm gonna go pay this thing.

14:51.021 --> 14:53.900
So am I off the hook now?

14:53.924 --> 14:55.101
What?

14:55.125 --> 14:57.543
This whole
father-daughter thing,

14:57.567 --> 14:59.005
we're done, right?

14:59.029 --> 15:03.980
Thursday, coffee at 2.
Be on time.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.958
Don't take this
the wrong way, but are you dim?

15:06.982 --> 15:10.416
Okay, I didn't exactly love what
I found out about you today,

15:10.440 --> 15:14.950
but the goal was to learn,
not to judge.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.194
I bring the coffee.

15:18.218 --> 15:21.548
That crap you made
burnt a hole in my stomach.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.353
This is tunde.

15:47.377 --> 15:49.355
He lost both his parents
to this drought.

15:49.379 --> 15:52.528
In fact, water is always scarce
in Botswana.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.930
The national currency is
called thepula orraindrop...

15:54.954 --> 15:57.011
Hello, Gabrielle.
What brings you here?

15:57.035 --> 16:00.006
I'm concerned about
the drought in Kenya.

16:00.030 --> 16:01.407
Botswana.

16:01.431 --> 16:04.210
Yeah, and you?

16:04.234 --> 16:06.221
Well, I'm organizing
this relief trip.

16:06.245 --> 16:07.573
We leave in a week.

16:07.597 --> 16:10.046
Well, bon voyage, father.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.547
I'm not going myself.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.549
We had to scale back
our relief efforts this year.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.127
We even had to cut a few of
the aid workers from the trip.

16:16.151 --> 16:19.125
Sister Mary, sister Greta
were so disappointed.

16:19.149 --> 16:20.656
If you just want to
hand some of...

16:20.680 --> 16:23.459
Sister Mary was going
on the trip?

16:23.483 --> 16:26.237
Well, sister Mary always goes
for at least a few months,

16:26.261 --> 16:28.594
but when our funding
came up short,

16:28.618 --> 16:30.966
she graciously offered
to step aside,

16:30.990 --> 16:33.299
said there's plenty of god's
work to do here.

16:33.323 --> 16:35.671
Thank you, Carlos.
Appreciate it.

16:35.695 --> 16:39.505
I bet she did.

16:39.529 --> 16:43.129
How much cash are you short,
father?

16:45.035 --> 16:47.353
We plan to set up
a modern system of irrigation.

16:47.377 --> 16:49.585
I'm sorry to interrupt,
sister Mary,

16:49.609 --> 16:51.487
but I have an announcement.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.520
I have just received
a donation of $8,000,

16:54.544 --> 16:58.994
which means that sister Mary
and sister Greta

16:59.018 --> 17:01.397
will be able to join
our relief trip to Botswana.

17:06.296 --> 17:11.026
It just goes to show
angels are everywhere.

17:20.810 --> 17:24.290
Hey. I'm here to see
Lynette Scavo.

17:24.314 --> 17:26.392
Oh, hi. Excuse me. Hi.

17:26.415 --> 17:28.094
I'm Lynette. You must be Fran.

17:28.117 --> 17:30.496
Hi. Ed said you needed
to talk to me.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.758
I couldn't imagine about what.

17:32.782 --> 17:35.101
Oh, well, come on in my office.

17:35.125 --> 17:39.065
You want me to put
my daughter in day care?

17:39.089 --> 17:41.067
But I'm a stay-at-home mom.

17:41.091 --> 17:44.070
I'm not suggesting that
you sign her up for all day.

17:44.094 --> 17:46.717
Maybe just a couple of hours
in the afternoon.

17:46.741 --> 17:48.214
Wouldn't that be great?

17:48.238 --> 17:52.378
Have some time to yourself,
relax, unwind?

17:52.402 --> 17:56.289
I don't need to unwind. I love
taking care of little mindy.

17:56.313 --> 17:59.285
Oh, of course, of course,

17:59.309 --> 18:03.129
but we all have days when
we're starting to lose it.

18:03.153 --> 18:05.536
Wouldn't it be nice
to have some place to take her

18:05.560 --> 18:07.415
before you want to strangle her?

18:09.819 --> 18:14.200
I Cherish every moment
I spend with her, truly.

18:14.224 --> 18:17.573
Really?

18:17.597 --> 18:21.177
Yeah. Look, I'm gonna
level with you.

18:21.201 --> 18:24.510
Parcher and Murphy can't have
a day care center

18:24.534 --> 18:27.683
unless we have at least 16 kids

18:27.707 --> 18:30.186
and without little mindy,
we only have 15.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.859
Well, that's not my problem.

18:33.883 --> 18:39.495
Okay. Okay. I just thought
I'd give it a shot.

18:39.519 --> 18:44.170
Well, I wish I could help you,
but I can't.

18:44.194 --> 18:47.204
Okay.

18:50.460 --> 18:53.579
Lynette, can I ask
you something?

18:53.603 --> 18:55.211
Yeah.

18:55.235 --> 18:58.214
Why did you have kids if you
weren't gonna raise them?

18:58.238 --> 19:00.886
Excuse me?

19:00.910 --> 19:03.118
Well, I just don't
understand women

19:03.142 --> 19:04.320
who say they want to be mothers,

19:04.344 --> 19:07.801
but then hand their kids
over to glorified babysitters.

19:07.825 --> 19:13.229
I work because
my family needs me to.

19:13.253 --> 19:17.233
Oh, dear, I've upset you,
and that wasn't my intention.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.905
I bet.

19:19.929 --> 19:22.208
Make no mistake,
I'm a good mother.

19:22.232 --> 19:24.310
That's the difference
between us...

19:24.334 --> 19:27.213
I couldn't settle
for being a good mother.

19:27.237 --> 19:30.446
I want to be agreatone.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.518
Bye-bye.

19:32.542 --> 19:34.242
Bye-bye.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.268
Oh, hi, alberta. How are you?

19:52.292 --> 19:53.699
Were you the one that sent out

19:53.723 --> 19:55.210
those neighborhood watch
pamphlets?

19:55.234 --> 19:59.375
I was wondering if maybe
you had any extra copies.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.969
Or I'll just borrow one
from somebody else. Thanks.

20:19.249 --> 20:21.227
Yep, looks like Carol's
penmanship.

20:21.251 --> 20:23.269
This is ridiculous.
What does she think,

20:23.293 --> 20:24.570
we're having an affair?

20:24.594 --> 20:26.877
Well, she probably saw you
drop me off yesterday,

20:26.901 --> 20:28.534
and she assumed the worst.

20:28.558 --> 20:30.376
Well, now you're gonna
have to tell her the truth.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.838
Oh, no, no, no.
I'd catch holy hell.

20:32.862 --> 20:34.780
Oh, so you want me
to catch it for you?

20:34.804 --> 20:36.447
I mean, you, yourself
said she's crazy.

20:36.471 --> 20:38.384
I don't want to wake up
tomorrow morning

20:38.408 --> 20:39.685
and find my tires slashed.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.010
All right. I'll talk to her.

20:50.650 --> 20:55.761
Hello, Edie. Do you have
something you'd like to say?

20:55.785 --> 20:58.434
No. That pretty much
says it all.

21:11.571 --> 21:15.751
Sister Mary,
what a lovely surprise.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.253
Well, I couldn't leave without
saying good-bye, Gabrielle.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.727
Oh, that's so sweet.
I'm really gonna miss you.

21:21.751 --> 21:23.389
I'm sure not half as much

21:23.413 --> 21:26.492
as you're gonna miss
your husband. Huh?

21:26.516 --> 21:29.965
Don't freak out.
I'm going to Botswana.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.538
What?! Sister Mary
needs a companion.

21:32.562 --> 21:35.641
What happened to sister Greta?!

21:35.665 --> 21:37.343
I was gonna go
with sister Greta,

21:37.367 --> 21:38.644
but the region is so volatile,

21:38.668 --> 21:41.377
I decided I'd feel much safer
with a male companion.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.379
Carlos,
you can't do this.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.751
You can't just go to Africa.

21:45.775 --> 21:48.354
Honey, I'm only gonna be gone
for two months.

21:48.378 --> 21:51.357
This journey
is important for me.

21:51.381 --> 21:53.411
I want to be one of
god's soldiers.

21:54.844 --> 21:56.567
And you will be one, Carlos.

21:56.591 --> 21:58.724
After you see the devastation
over there,

21:58.748 --> 21:59.865
you're never the same.

21:59.889 --> 22:03.429
You see how selfish
your old life is

22:03.453 --> 22:05.940
and you just want to
get rid of everything

22:05.964 --> 22:07.603
that reminds you of it.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.935
Oh, gosh. I should get going
and start packing.

22:09.959 --> 22:11.407
We leave in less than a week.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.939
I should probably send a thank
you letter to my parole officer.

22:13.963 --> 22:16.943
He's being a real mensch
about this.

22:19.509 --> 22:21.687
I may be a catholic,

22:21.711 --> 22:24.490
but I am so not above
slapping a nun.

22:24.514 --> 22:28.354
Go ahead.

22:28.378 --> 22:30.426
Do it.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.480
Just make sure you hit
hard enough to leave a Mark.

22:36.956 --> 22:41.086
Yeah. I didn't think so.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.613
Kiss the kids good night

22:47.637 --> 22:51.417
and I'll see them
in the morning. Okay, yeah.

22:51.441 --> 22:54.480
I love you, too. Bye-bye.

22:54.504 --> 22:56.457
I'm sorry about the day care
thing, Lynette,

22:56.481 --> 22:59.124
but Fran hardly ever
lets me hold the kid.

22:59.148 --> 23:00.826
You know, since day one,
all I ever got was,

23:00.850 --> 23:02.628
"support the head,
support the head."

23:02.652 --> 23:06.562
I think I know how
to support a damn baby head.

23:08.588 --> 23:11.467
Ohh, let's just...
Let's just do this.

23:11.491 --> 23:14.400
I don't want to be here
all night.

23:16.426 --> 23:18.544
You're mindy's father.

23:18.568 --> 23:21.106
You have a right
to spend time with her.

23:21.130 --> 23:23.409
I know, but what can I do?

23:23.433 --> 23:25.150
You could stand up to Fran.

23:25.174 --> 23:27.921
If you don't, you'll just
become more resentful,

23:27.945 --> 23:29.415
she'll get nuttier.

23:29.439 --> 23:31.987
And without a father figure,

23:32.011 --> 23:34.790
poor mindy will grow up
to be a stripper.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.422
A stripper?

23:36.446 --> 23:38.446
There's science to back that up.

23:42.191 --> 23:43.669
You know what?

23:43.693 --> 23:47.680
You go ahead and push the button
on this day care thing, Lynette,

23:47.704 --> 23:49.535
and count mindy in.

23:49.559 --> 23:51.106
Yeah, I'll handle Fran.

23:51.130 --> 23:54.440
You're doing
the right thing, ed,

23:54.464 --> 23:56.912
for little mindy.

24:03.843 --> 24:07.853
Yeah.

24:07.877 --> 24:11.757
Dude, what if your mom walks in?

24:11.781 --> 24:13.529
She won't.

24:13.553 --> 24:15.030
You don't know that.

24:15.054 --> 24:18.164
Just wait till
everybody's asleep.

24:19.629 --> 24:21.206
Seriously.

24:21.230 --> 24:24.530
I'll make it worth your while.

24:26.496 --> 24:28.466
You better.

24:32.672 --> 24:34.520
I wish she would walk in on us,

24:34.544 --> 24:37.953
just to see the expression
on her face.

24:37.977 --> 24:41.587
God, I hate her so much.

24:41.611 --> 24:45.491
Still, though,
she's your mother.

24:45.515 --> 24:48.463
Don't you sort of
have to love her?

24:48.487 --> 24:52.638
Last year, when she found out
that I like guys,

24:52.662 --> 24:54.670
she freaked out.

24:54.694 --> 24:57.172
She said that if
I didn't change,

24:57.196 --> 24:58.644
I'd be going straight to hell,

24:58.668 --> 25:02.808
so since I knew that
I couldn't change,

25:02.832 --> 25:06.151
it suddenly hit me that one day,

25:06.175 --> 25:09.685
my own mother was
gonna stop loving me,

25:09.709 --> 25:13.559
so I decided to stop
loving her first.

25:13.583 --> 25:15.570
That way,
it wouldn't hurt so bad.

25:15.594 --> 25:18.524
She didn't know
what she was saying.

25:18.548 --> 25:21.567
Yes, she did,

25:21.591 --> 25:23.168
so now she's got to be punished.

25:23.192 --> 25:26.031
How are you gonna punish her?

25:26.055 --> 25:29.635
One day, she'll slip up,

25:29.659 --> 25:31.807
and I'll have something
against her

25:31.831 --> 25:34.079
and when that happens,

25:34.103 --> 25:37.082
I'm gonna take her down so hard,

25:37.106 --> 25:38.714
she'll never get back up.

25:38.738 --> 25:41.216
It may take you awhile
to get something on her.

25:41.240 --> 25:44.550
That's okay.

25:44.574 --> 25:46.684
I don't mind waiting
for the things that I want.

26:04.133 --> 26:06.972
Lynette, hey, hey.
Look who's here.

26:06.996 --> 26:09.945
Hey! You know, the day care room

26:09.969 --> 26:12.177
won't be ready until
next week at the earliest.

26:12.201 --> 26:14.249
If I had waited, I might
have lost my nerve.

26:14.273 --> 26:15.621
I had a window.

26:15.645 --> 26:17.322
Fran was in the shower,

26:17.346 --> 26:18.654
so I just grabbed the baby
and ran.

26:18.678 --> 26:21.757
You took the baby
without telling Fran?

26:21.781 --> 26:24.690
I refuse to be bullied
by that woman. You were right.

26:24.714 --> 26:26.671
Mindy is my daughter,
I wanted to spend time with her.

26:26.695 --> 26:27.993
I have that right.

26:28.017 --> 26:31.997
Um, ed, the lobby just called
and your wife's on her way up

26:32.021 --> 26:33.799
and she seems pretty angry.

26:33.823 --> 26:35.801
Oh, man.

26:35.825 --> 26:38.774
Here. Hold mindy. Oh.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.606
Let me handle this.

26:40.630 --> 26:42.600
Oh, I was planning to.

26:47.737 --> 26:49.715
I thought mindy
had been kidnapped!

26:49.739 --> 26:50.986
I left a sticky note.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.357
I wasn't looking for
a sticky note, ed!

26:52.381 --> 26:54.189
I was looking for
my missing child!

26:54.213 --> 26:56.596
She's my child, too,
and she's staying here,

26:56.620 --> 26:57.963
just a few hours a day.

26:57.987 --> 26:59.995
You, give her to me.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.326
No, I made a decision.

27:01.350 --> 27:03.669
Yeah? Okay, watch me
make a decision.

27:03.693 --> 27:06.732
I'm done with this marriage.
I'm taking my baby

27:06.756 --> 27:08.103
and I'm getting on a plane
to Pittsburgh.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.134
You wouldn't dare!

27:09.158 --> 27:10.636
You think you miss mindy now,

27:10.660 --> 27:12.137
wait till we're living
with my mother!

27:12.161 --> 27:13.939
I'll fight you on this.
Yeah? Try...

27:13.963 --> 27:16.311
As Lynette saw her dreams
of day care

27:16.335 --> 27:17.612
about to board a plane
to Pittsburgh,

27:17.636 --> 27:20.716
a baby needs her mother!
You're crazy, you know that?!

27:20.740 --> 27:22.748
Yeah! I'm crazy to think...

27:22.772 --> 27:26.752
She decided this flight
would have to be grounded.

27:26.776 --> 27:27.723
You don't scare me.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.394
Oh. Oh!

27:29.418 --> 27:31.096
What the hell is she doing?!

27:31.120 --> 27:32.758
Open up! Give me my baby!

27:32.782 --> 27:33.929
Good thinking, Lynette!

27:33.953 --> 27:35.810
I am not on your side, ed.
You're not?

27:35.834 --> 27:37.803
No, I am on mindy's side.

27:37.827 --> 27:39.634
She is the one caught
in the middle,

27:39.658 --> 27:42.637
and I'm not letting you two
have her until you calm down.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.810
I want my damn child.

27:44.834 --> 27:47.673
Lynette, I have Tom on line two.

27:47.697 --> 27:50.375
Pat, can you see here
I'm holding a baby hostage?!

27:50.399 --> 27:51.646
I will call back!

27:51.670 --> 27:55.350
All right, that's it.
I'm calling the police.

27:55.374 --> 27:58.028
Oh, for god's sakes! Lynette's
not going to hurt the baby!

27:58.052 --> 28:00.325
No, and you're gonna get her
back a whole lot faster

28:00.349 --> 28:03.058
if you will just listen
to me, okay?

28:03.082 --> 28:06.732
Listen, and you?
All right, good.

28:06.756 --> 28:09.364
So first of all, ed, stealing
the baby was really stupid.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.767
Thank you. You're welcome.

28:11.791 --> 28:15.941
You need to find a better way
to communicate with your wife.

28:15.965 --> 28:18.904
And, Fran, I know what
the pressure of trying to be

28:18.928 --> 28:20.746
a super parent
does to your head.

28:20.770 --> 28:24.209
You can take a break
andbe a great mom.

28:24.233 --> 28:30.886
Doesn't this little sweetheart
deserve a well-rested mommy?

28:30.910 --> 28:35.220
Well, I guess the pressure
does get to me a little.

28:35.244 --> 28:37.923
And it's okay to admit that.

28:37.947 --> 28:43.328
This is communication.
This is good.

28:43.352 --> 28:45.739
Why don't you guys
go down to the lobby,

28:45.763 --> 28:48.033
talk it out over some coffee?

28:48.057 --> 28:50.075
Uh, what about mindy?

28:50.099 --> 28:52.759
We've got day care!

28:56.936 --> 29:00.236
â™ª We've got day care â™ª

29:20.860 --> 29:24.409
Hi. I called earlier from
the spiritual outreach program?

29:24.433 --> 29:26.211
Hi. Piano player, right?

29:26.235 --> 29:28.874
This is so generous of you.

29:28.898 --> 29:32.848
There it is. It's not
exactly a concert grand.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.080
I should warn you, on the whole,

29:35.104 --> 29:38.183
our patients are generally
unresponsive,

29:38.207 --> 29:41.186
so I hope you don't expect
a lot of clapping.

29:41.210 --> 29:45.130
Miss Delaney, I find when
the spiritual rewards

29:45.154 --> 29:47.893
are this great,
who needs applause?

29:47.917 --> 29:50.817
Excuse me.

30:17.917 --> 30:22.067
Did Addison talk to you
about me?

30:22.091 --> 30:24.970
Oh! I guess not.

30:24.994 --> 30:26.237
He's a married man!

30:26.261 --> 30:28.303
What's wrong with you?!
No, wait! Wait!

30:28.327 --> 30:29.835
It's not what you think!

30:29.859 --> 30:31.076
He hasn't touched me
for three years

30:31.100 --> 30:34.809
because of sluts like you!

30:34.833 --> 30:36.086
Carol, if you would just stop

30:36.110 --> 30:38.113
throwing things at me,
I'll explain!

30:38.137 --> 30:42.587
How... how can you explain?!
You're screwing my husband!

30:42.611 --> 30:45.411
No, I'm not screwing him!
He's my father!

30:48.177 --> 30:51.226
I'm so sorry.

30:51.250 --> 30:54.399
I thought you should know,
but he didn't want to tell you.

30:54.423 --> 30:57.462
I want to die.

30:57.486 --> 30:58.964
Oh, no. I do.

30:58.988 --> 31:01.336
Oh, Carol, you don't have
to clean that up.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.169
They have clerks for that.

31:04.193 --> 31:05.510
How old are you?

31:05.534 --> 31:07.512
38.

31:07.536 --> 31:12.247
We've been married 39 years.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.049
It's been going on
from the start.

31:14.073 --> 31:17.182
Believe me, I didn't want
to hurt anyone.

31:17.206 --> 31:19.955
I just wanted to find my dad.

31:19.979 --> 31:25.009
I'm glad you did,
but you be careful, sweetheart.

31:26.555 --> 31:29.655
He's gonna break your heart.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.891
Andrew, I made an appointment
with a therapist

31:47.915 --> 31:49.614
for you, me and Danielle.

31:49.638 --> 31:51.556
I don't think so.

31:51.580 --> 31:54.589
This pain that you're feeling
is completely natural,

31:54.613 --> 31:57.370
but it's not gonna go away
until you deal with it.

31:57.394 --> 32:01.066
Andrew, I want us to heal,

32:01.090 --> 32:03.198
I want us to be a family again.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.330
You know what I want?

32:05.354 --> 32:08.081
I want for George Williams
to walk through that door

32:08.105 --> 32:12.207
so I can take a knife
and plunge it into his heart.

32:12.231 --> 32:15.280
I want the pharmacist to pay
for what he did to my father.

32:15.304 --> 32:18.283
Well, the good news
is he's... He's dead.

32:18.307 --> 32:22.547
He committed suicide.
His death was on his terms.

32:22.571 --> 32:23.989
That's not justice.

32:24.013 --> 32:29.054
So are you saying
if he were executed

32:29.078 --> 32:31.926
that it would be easier
for you to get past this?

32:31.950 --> 32:33.120
Of course.

32:43.062 --> 32:49.702
George... didn't intend
to commit suicide.

32:52.671 --> 32:55.988
He was trying to manipulate me
into taking him back,

32:56.012 --> 32:59.124
and he swallowed those pills

32:59.148 --> 33:01.186
hoping that
I'd feel sorry for him.

33:01.210 --> 33:07.032
He just assumed that I would
call an ambulance.

33:07.056 --> 33:10.556
When I got there, he was
already slipping away.

33:13.092 --> 33:16.501
I tried to get him to
accept responsibility

33:16.525 --> 33:18.395
for what he'd done...

33:21.130 --> 33:22.977
But he wouldn't.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.010
So what'd you do?

33:25.034 --> 33:28.314
Nothing.

33:31.140 --> 33:35.690
I just sat there
and let him die.

33:35.714 --> 33:38.763
Oh, my god.

33:38.787 --> 33:43.498
He didn't die
on his terms, Andrew.

33:43.522 --> 33:47.262
He paid for what he did
to your father.

33:53.202 --> 33:56.742
Thank you
for telling me this.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.172
Hey, how you doin'?

35:49.618 --> 35:51.226
Yeah?

35:51.250 --> 35:52.727
Zach's come home.

35:52.751 --> 35:55.700
What? Is he okay?

35:55.724 --> 35:56.731
He's fine.

35:56.755 --> 35:58.433
Is there anything I can do?

35:58.457 --> 35:59.764
Thanks for asking.

35:59.788 --> 36:02.136
You can leave us alone.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.340
I spent a lot of time
looking for Zach,

36:05.364 --> 36:06.841
and you know why.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.343
Maybe I'm not
making myself clear.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.345
You come near my son,
I'll go to the police.

36:10.369 --> 36:13.318
I'll tell them what happened
out in that quarry.

36:13.342 --> 36:16.150
You do that
and we'll both go down.

36:16.174 --> 36:19.414
Well, you know I'm capable
of almost anything.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.258
Hey, I thought you'd like
to know

36:23.282 --> 36:25.260
Zach and I are moving away.

36:25.284 --> 36:28.268
I want to give my son
a shot at a normal life.

36:28.292 --> 36:30.195
I'm sure you'll agree
it's for the best.

36:30.219 --> 36:33.498
Now see, this is where
you and I don't see eye-to-eye.

36:33.522 --> 36:37.202
For Zach's sake,
I'll keep quiet, for now,

36:37.226 --> 36:39.404
but you're not taking him away.

36:39.428 --> 36:43.177
If I see a "for sale" sign
in front of that house,

36:43.201 --> 36:44.849
I'llcall the police.

36:44.873 --> 36:48.213
I'm capable of pretty much
anything myself.

37:03.792 --> 37:06.336
The doctor's going to
give you a full work-up,

37:06.360 --> 37:08.202
then we'll start
the inoculations.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.204
Make sure you fill out
everything

37:10.228 --> 37:12.677
and the nurse will take
you back. Thank you.

37:12.701 --> 37:15.510
Boy, sister Mary's
done a number on you.

37:15.534 --> 37:17.211
Right.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.583
Yes, right.

37:18.607 --> 37:20.415
She has you flying
halfway across the world

37:20.439 --> 37:23.688
to help the poor, and there's
perfectly good poor right here.

37:23.712 --> 37:26.296
For god's sakes, give a buck
to a homeless guy.

37:26.320 --> 37:27.322
It's not the same.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.294
No, it's better because
you can do it

37:29.318 --> 37:30.595
in the comfort of your own car.

37:30.619 --> 37:32.957
The point is not to be
comfortable, Gaby.

37:32.981 --> 37:35.400
It's about easing
pain and suffering.

37:35.424 --> 37:38.433
Look, I'm trying to be
a better person here.

37:38.457 --> 37:41.466
Now you can either help me
or you can get out of the way,

37:41.490 --> 37:43.468
but you can't stop me.

37:43.492 --> 37:46.010
Carlos solis?

37:46.034 --> 37:47.412
Come with me, please.

37:47.436 --> 37:51.276
Finish that for me.

37:55.504 --> 37:57.452
Here.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.854
He didn't fill out
the allergy section.

37:59.878 --> 38:02.887
Honey, he's going to
a remote village in Africa.

38:02.911 --> 38:05.390
Does it really matter
that he's allergic to eggs?

38:05.414 --> 38:06.801
Actually, yes.
Eggs are on the list.

38:06.825 --> 38:09.564
He could have a severe reaction
to the yellow fever vaccine,

38:09.588 --> 38:12.397
and he won't be getting out
of bed,

38:12.421 --> 38:14.469
let alone leaving the country.

38:14.493 --> 38:16.301
Really?

38:16.325 --> 38:18.473
Oh, don't write that down.

38:18.497 --> 38:22.907
I wasn't being specific.
He's allergic to fish eggs.

38:22.931 --> 38:24.479
Fish eggs?

38:24.503 --> 38:27.320
Poor baby's gone his whole life
without caviar.

38:27.344 --> 38:29.414
Now that's suffering.

38:29.438 --> 38:34.478
All right, doc, give me
all you got.

38:38.947 --> 38:41.626
It's so hot in this village.

38:41.650 --> 38:43.798
Baby, that's the fever talking.

38:43.822 --> 38:46.576
The doctor said you're having
an allergic reaction,

38:46.600 --> 38:48.503
but you're gonna be fine, okay?

38:48.527 --> 38:51.336
Hold me.

38:51.360 --> 38:56.981
Ohh, honey. I'm so sorry.

38:57.005 --> 39:00.615
Ohh, maybe that stupid nun
is right.

39:00.639 --> 39:03.918
Maybe I am trying to stop you
from becoming a better person.

39:03.942 --> 39:09.053
It's just that I love you
the way you are...

39:09.077 --> 39:12.397
Greedy, selfish and insensitive.

39:12.421 --> 39:15.329
I'm just scared if you're
not those things anymore,

39:15.353 --> 39:21.335
you're gonna wake up
one day and realize I still am,

39:21.359 --> 39:22.837
and then you won't want me.

39:22.861 --> 39:26.741
I want you. Just hold me.

39:26.765 --> 39:28.713
Ohh.

39:28.737 --> 39:32.377
Ohh, Carlos.

39:32.401 --> 39:35.480
Hold me...

39:37.375 --> 39:39.775
Sister Mary.

39:45.584 --> 39:49.934
Painting in the rain?
Is that smart?

39:49.958 --> 39:51.666
Well, let me see,
painting in the rain

39:51.690 --> 39:53.538
or letting the whole world
think I'm a whore?

39:53.562 --> 39:56.401
I don't know. What do you think?

39:56.425 --> 39:58.372
Heard you ran into my wife.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.373
Yep.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.045
So?

40:01.069 --> 40:04.579
So you are hereby released
of any further obligation

40:04.603 --> 40:06.451
to be my dad.

40:06.475 --> 40:08.583
Okay.

40:08.607 --> 40:12.917
Just so you know,
I'm not actually proud

40:12.941 --> 40:16.390
of what I've done,
you know, my hobbies.

40:16.414 --> 40:19.564
Good for you. Bye.

40:19.588 --> 40:23.568
I have done things I'm proud of.

40:23.592 --> 40:27.171
I could give you
five examples right now.

40:27.195 --> 40:29.474
Okay, maybe three.

40:29.498 --> 40:33.578
You don't have to do this.

40:33.602 --> 40:36.110
I was a volunteer fireman.

40:36.134 --> 40:39.091
I put out fires,
I got kittens out of trees,

40:39.115 --> 40:40.515
the whole nine yards.

40:40.539 --> 40:42.086
Sweet.

40:42.110 --> 40:45.189
About 20 years ago,

40:45.213 --> 40:47.827
I started a foundation
to protect wild horses.

40:47.851 --> 40:49.794
I probably saved
hundreds of them.

40:49.818 --> 40:52.657
Really?

40:52.681 --> 40:54.481
I'm full of surprises.

40:56.755 --> 40:59.664
Okay, one more.

40:59.688 --> 41:05.910
I wasn't exactly thrilled when
you walked back into my life.

41:05.934 --> 41:08.913
Now that I've met you,

41:08.937 --> 41:12.577
well, you gave me
a third thing to be proud of.

41:12.601 --> 41:16.681
That was a good one.

41:16.705 --> 41:19.505
That's why I saved it for last.

41:22.781 --> 41:25.690
I have to spend some time
working on my marriage.

41:25.714 --> 41:27.632
When that's all sorted out,

41:27.656 --> 41:32.256
maybe we could continue
with the catching up?

41:34.693 --> 41:37.633
I'll wait for your call.

41:46.675 --> 41:50.705
The stories are as old
as time itself...

41:52.280 --> 41:55.059
The prodigal son
who returns home

41:55.083 --> 41:58.023
to the father
who forgives him...

41:59.948 --> 42:03.097
The jealous wife
who tricks the husband

42:03.121 --> 42:05.091
who trusts her...

42:06.925 --> 42:11.636
The desperate mother
who risks everything

42:11.660 --> 42:14.508
for the child who needs her

42:14.532 --> 42:18.082
and the faithless husband

42:18.106 --> 42:22.647
who hurts the wife
who loves him so deeply.

42:22.671 --> 42:26.891
Why do we listen
again and again?

42:26.915 --> 42:30.054
Because these are the stories
of family,

42:30.078 --> 42:33.157
and once we look past
the fighting, pain

42:33.181 --> 42:35.730
and the resentment,

42:35.754 --> 42:40.004
we occasionally like
to remind ourselves...

42:40.028 --> 42:42.667
Hi! Hi.

42:42.691 --> 42:47.612
There is absolutely nothing
more important.

42:47.636 --> 42:49.636
Hi, bunny, bunny. Hi.
