11:00.793 --> 11:04.673
Told you not to get
Shamsher along.

11:05.064 --> 11:07.340
The loser can't aim.

11:14.741 --> 11:18.188
Just can't!
You are making a fool out of me.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.752
I don't have time for all this.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.047
Have been hearing that

The hoardings have gone up twice.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.658

We didn't sign up for this.

13:42.088 --> 13:45.092
Son, hear me out.
Could you talk to him...

13:46.159 --> 13:47.433
I'm really sorry.

the deal off, yeah?

13:50.763 --> 13:52.470
Bye!

13:52.532 --> 13:58.278

You are misunderstanding me.

14:51.057 --> 14:51.501
Yes, you did.

14:51.724 --> 14:55.069
No, Tommy.
Don't say that. You know...

14:55.194 --> 14:56.764

Only Tommy fires Tommy.
Are you f***king Tommy?

15:41.140 --> 15:42.778
Listen up, f****r!

15:43.042 --> 15:48.082
F****kr, you Whatsapp dad begging

15:50.550 --> 15:53.030
F**king s**t!

15:53.086 --> 15:54.463
The best record labels in
the world want Tommy!

15:54.520 --> 15:56.500
Not you!
You bloody ear-grease!

15:57.089 --> 15:59.330
Who's the GABRUl?
- Who's your Daddy?!

15:59.392 --> 16:01.394
Ask your hot wife who's the GABRUl?

16:02.028 --> 16:04.304
Speedy, we'll split
your behind open...

16:04.363 --> 16:07.139

16:34.360 --> 16:35.703

16:38.464 --> 16:41.308
Speedy, you motherf***kr!

16:50.042 --> 16:51.646
Ambush his damn car, f***kr!

17:21.374 --> 17:22.182
Be careful, bro.

17:22.241 --> 17:24.050
F**k, are you crazy?

17:25.278 --> 17:26.382
Do you find this funny?

17:27.046 --> 17:30.118
Do you? The dea

17:31.484 --> 17:33.088
You are past your e><piry date, babe.

17:37.757 --> 17:41.136
And so are you, Tommy.
So are you!

17:57.443 --> 17:59.548
Why are the lights off?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.423
Switch on the lights.

18:02.481 --> 18:04.222
Anyone home?

18:05.718 --> 18:12.567
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

18:12.625 --> 18:16.266
Tommy, the GABRU!

18:18.331 --> 18:20.174
Party!

18:25.638 --> 18:29.381
There are cities in Me><ico...

18:29.642 --> 18:31.212
where the cops can't put a foot in.

18:31.510 --> 18:32.284
Really?

18:32.411 --> 18:34.220
Drug lords are the bloody lavv.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.386
Don't get me wrong...

18:37.517 --> 18:40.191
but what have the police done here?

18:40.553 --> 18:42.396
The situation is the same.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.328
The situation is the same?
- Yes, brother.

18:49.495 --> 18:52.066
Stop that sister f****r!

18:52.265 --> 18:53.107
Stop him.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.680
Stop him!
- Get him down.

18:56.736 --> 19:00.115
Get down.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.256
Brilliant!

19:13.019 --> 19:13.690
Where are your papers?

19:15.221 --> 19:16.393
It is election time.

19:17.456 --> 19:18.594
Driving without papers, a**h*le?

19:19.292 --> 19:22.239
Look at the packaging.

19:22.361 --> 19:23.999
With proper branding.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.037
First it was those mini-vans

19:26.098 --> 19:27.372
now they're getting them in trucks.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.538
This is what they call progress.

19:31.437 --> 19:33.246
Green revolution, part two.

19:33.472 --> 19:35.110
But what about our progress?

19:35.308 --> 19:38.084
Our cut is still the same.
F****ng 10,000 rupees!

19:38.344 --> 19:40.585
Can we get anything in 10,000?
- No.

19:41.047 --> 19:44.085
I think they've taken
the Punjab police for granted.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.496
There's no regard
for lavv and order here.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.361
If this continues,
Punjab will become 
\/Ie><ico.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.161
Sister f*****r, you will turn Punjab into Mexico?
- No, sir.

19:52.224 --> 19:53.464
I will not, sir!

19:53.526 --> 19:54.664
I feel he surely will.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.708
No, sir. I will not
turn it to a 
\/Ie><ico. Never!

19:57.763 --> 20:00.642
Tell your boss to up
our commission.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.340
It's a red light here!

20:03.402 --> 20:04.437
No green light.

20:04.503 --> 20:07.006
Yes, sir.
- F**k off!

20:07.773 --> 20:10.276
Make it quick... move!

20:11.610 --> 20:14.113
See... cop power?

20:14.447 --> 20:15.551
Yes.

20:16.449 --> 20:19.191
Who is calling?
Yes, sir.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.795
I'll be there... right away.

20:24.190 --> 20:24.725
Go to hell!

20:26.625 --> 20:27.501
Let's go, Sana].

20:27.660 --> 20:30.800
I'll show you what
‘law and order‘ can do.

20:31.497 --> 20:37.072
<i>"Baby, come sit in my car
We'll celebrate your happy birthday</i>

20:37.169 --> 20:42.084

21:13.005 --> 21:16.748
<i>Infinite lines of coke,
Who keeps a track?</i>

21:17.009 --> 21:18.044
The cops are here!

21:19.612 --> 21:20.784
<i>Punjab is flying high!</i>

21:21.080 --> 21:24.152
Stop this nonsense.
- Party is over!

21:25.050 --> 21:26.791
Sir! This is a birthday...
- Stop it!

21:27.053 --> 21:28.396
Sir, this is a birthday party.

21:28.454 --> 21:29.398
Where is Tommy?

21:29.455 --> 21:31.799
Sir, Tommy is not here.
It is a birthday party.

21:32.057 --> 21:32.797
Where is Tommy?

21:33.058 --> 21:35.265
Sir, Tommy is not here.
Back off!

21:35.694 --> 21:37.367
Sir, Tommy is not here.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.704
He's lying.
- Liar!

21:38.764 --> 21:40.766
I am not lying. I swear on you.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.442
What happened?

21:44.170 --> 21:46.275
Gracing us with your presence at 3 am?

21:46.705 --> 21:48.082
ls there a problem?

21:48.407 --> 21:50.478
Get some tea and cookies.
We've got guests.

21:50.543 --> 21:53.422
No need for that.
We have orders from the top.

21:53.612 --> 21:57.526
Get Tommy here. Or all these
sister f****rs will gets arrested.

21:58.417 --> 22:02.627
Tommy?
He left for London yesterday.

22:44.396 --> 22:45.431
Who's the GABRU?

22:48.067 --> 22:49.375
I'm the GABRU.

22:49.401 --> 22:50.209
What?

22:51.403 --> 22:52.347
I didn't hear that.

22:54.340 --> 22:55.444
I'm the GABRU.

22:58.410 --> 22:59.411
Haven't you eaten?

22:59.645 --> 23:01.215
I'm the GABRU.

23:01.347 --> 23:02.826
I still can't hear you.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.062
I'm the GABRU.

23:05.117 --> 23:09.065
I'm the GABRU.

23:11.157 --> 23:14.468
Didn't Tommy go to London?

23:16.161 --> 23:19.040
So apparently he is here.

23:19.231 --> 23:23.611
But he has given up cocaine.
Doesn't even touch it.

23:23.702 --> 23:30.551
Listen up sister f******s!
I am the f***king GABRU!

23:38.617 --> 23:40.528
Tommy Singh's arrest is
the latest development...

23:40.586 --> 23:44.056
in the drug crisis that has been
plaguing Punjab for the last few years...

23:44.223 --> 23:48.535
And we have with us eminent politician
IVIP - i\/Ir. ivlaninder Brar

23:48.661 --> 23:51.437
Instead of taking concrete
steps to tackle the drug menace...

23:51.564 --> 23:54.272
Why is the government going
for soft targets like Tommy Singh.

23:54.366 --> 23:55.811
People like Tommy Singh -

23:56.135 --> 23:59.412
they are the ones who are encouraging
drug addiction in our society

23:59.438 --> 24:02.476
with their music,
with their choice of lifestyle.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.587
Look at the kind of videos
they are making.

24:06.478 --> 24:10.426
I think the youth of Punjab deserves
a better role model than Tommy Singh.

24:10.482 --> 24:11.426
Bloody phoney!

24:11.483 --> 24:14.430
-The mi
k's come to a boil.
Turn off the stove!

24:14.486 --> 24:15.624
- Please understand this.

24:16.555 --> 24:17.295
Breakfast!

24:17.623 --> 24:20.069
Drop Balli off to college.
He's still asleep.

24:20.359 --> 24:21.667
Good morning to you also!

24:21.727 --> 24:26.733
Phagvvara's boy transformed from
Punjab's Gabru to a menace to society.

24:28.200 --> 24:28.735
Greetings.

24:29.001 --> 24:32.073
Greetings, son. You ready?

24:32.738 --> 24:34.046
Good morning, grandma.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.517
Bless you, son.

24:35.574 --> 24:37.383
I am very worried about Balli.

24:37.743 --> 24:40.314
He wears sunglasses even at home.

24:40.379 --> 24:41.619
Even at home?
- Doesn't study at all.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.182
Let me talk to him.

24:44.383 --> 24:45.384
Balli!

24:46.585 --> 24:47.563
Balli!

24:49.054 --> 24:50.032
Balli!

24:53.625 --> 24:54.365
Get ready.

24:55.160 --> 24:55.763
Aren't you late for college?

24:57.262 --> 24:58.297
And remove this idiofs poster.

25:01.700 --> 25:04.203
With your precious vote,

25:04.270 --> 25:07.717
make Rajveer Singh Pehlwan win.

25:07.773 --> 25:11.482
His victory is yours as well.

25:12.378 --> 25:16.292
Please vote for him!

25:16.515 --> 25:20.088
Vote for Rajveer Singh!

25:31.997 --> 25:32.771
Listen...

25:33.565 --> 25:34.407
Come here...

25:38.437 --> 25:39.313
Need money?

25:43.542 --> 25:46.113
If I find you at a coffee shop,
I'll thrash you.

25:48.414 --> 25:49.518
Thank you!

26:00.526 --> 26:04.770
Yeah, I'm on my way.
"m getting it.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.178
Give me two today.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.244
Faster.

26:22.214 --> 26:23.625
Greetings.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.730
Greetings. Hovv are you?

26:31.390 --> 26:33.495
Why? You took very long.

26:33.525 --> 26:36.768
You know, Punjab roads are a mess.

26:38.063 --> 26:40.339
Here's the stuff you asked for.

26:40.399 --> 26:43.209
This one is white
and this is the pink stuff.

26:44.637 --> 26:48.414
This one is for five grand
and this is for 10.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.076
This one is very good as well.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.018
Try it once

26:52.611 --> 26:54.454
and you'll surely ask for more!

26:58.517 --> 27:00.155
What are you doing here?

27:01.387 --> 27:03.298
My stomach is hurting.

27:03.789 --> 27:05.200
I need to go to the doctor.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.133
Get back by 12 o'clock.

27:07.192 --> 27:08.603
Or I'll cut your entire day's pay.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.102
Run along.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.199
There's a shortage.

27:12.698 --> 27:14.200
Check the stuff.

27:22.474 --> 27:25.751
That soap. The red one.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.250
The one on top?

27:33.385 --> 27:35.729
There used to be a huge crowd

27:36.054 --> 27:37.226
at the tea stall earlier.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.993
Who drinks tea these days?

27:39.158 --> 27:42.139
They are all drugged out at the ruins.

27:50.636 --> 27:52.513
Did you see Tommy's pose?

27:53.138 --> 27:55.015
Take that, yo, sister f****r!

27:55.541 --> 27:57.452
His brother caught Tommy.

27:57.776 --> 27:59.449
Dﬂk!

28:03.048 --> 28:03.617
Idiot!

28:05.684 --> 28:09.393
Don't take it to heart, my love.

28:13.058 --> 28:14.264
Who are you?

28:14.726 --> 28:16.364
What are you looking at?

28:18.363 --> 28:19.501
Do you want stuff?

28:20.566 --> 28:22.011
What do you have?

28:22.668 --> 28:23.544
Powder.

28:24.736 --> 28:25.737
Heroin?

28:26.071 --> 28:27.982
What?
- Heroin?

28:28.140 --> 28:30.120
Yes. That. Heroin.

28:30.742 --> 28:32.483
I don't have any money. Ask them.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.252
You ask them. And take a commission.

28:37.182 --> 28:38.126
Hovv much?

28:38.684 --> 28:39.754
Hovv much can you offer?

28:40.185 --> 28:41.323
3000 is the going rate.

28:42.354 --> 28:43.594
Hovv much do you have?

28:43.755 --> 28:44.756
Three.

28:45.123 --> 28:47.034
Come tomorrow.
I'll have it arranged.

28:47.092 --> 28:48.093
Full three grams, right?

28:48.260 --> 28:49.102
Kilos!

28:51.163 --> 28:52.198
Three kilos!

28:52.698 --> 28:55.406
Where did you get that much stuff?

28:55.567 --> 28:57.478
Do you really want it?
Or should I leave?

28:59.571 --> 29:01.380
Nobody can buy it here.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.645
There is someone in tovvn.
Raja, he is...

29:04.710 --> 29:06.053
Give me his mobile...

29:07.346 --> 29:08.450

29:10.048 --> 29:14.258
9988... I will take 1O percent.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.162
What?
- 1O percent. 10!

29:16.288 --> 29:17.528
No. Five percent.

29:19.958 --> 29:21.631
Alright)’-

29:24.163 --> 29:25.107
He's back.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.533
Brother of a cop!

29:29.334 --> 29:31.678
Again... already?

29:32.137 --> 29:32.979
Easy, bro!

29:33.472 --> 29:34.746
Give it an hour at least.

29:35.073 --> 29:37.110
Get lost.

29:37.643 --> 29:39.748
Don't act like a roadie, bro!

29:45.751 --> 29:48.095
Ba

30:12.177 --> 30:14.350
Give me the blood pressure set. Hurry!

30:16.315 --> 30:18.591

30:25.190 --> 30:26.430
Balli?

30:27.025 --> 30:28.197
Doctor...

30:28.593 --> 30:30.129
ls he going to make it?

30:30.262 --> 30:31.240
Wait outside.

30:31.363 --> 30:32.637
The doctor is coming. Please.

30:32.698 --> 30:35.542
So call the doctor. Who is the doctor?

30:35.600 --> 30:37.079
Please wait outside.
- Balli...

30:37.135 --> 30:39.081
Inform the traffic police.

30:40.706 --> 30:43.448
Turn him on his side.
Hovv many times should I tell you?

30:50.782 --> 30:52.819
Open your eyes, kiddo.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.122
Show me the readings.

31:00.459 --> 31:01.802
Get the IV line started.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.504
Prepare a Nalo><one injection.
Double dose.

31:04.663 --> 31:05.607
Madam...

31:06.765 --> 31:07.800
Will he be okay?

31:08.400 --> 31:09.708
Please wait outside.

31:11.103 --> 31:13.140
Please wait outside. Please.

31:13.405 --> 31:17.478
If you have any sort of addiction -

31:17.542 --> 31:20.751
alcohol or drugs
- you just let us know.

31:20.779 --> 31:23.760
We will get you off any addiction.

31:23.782 --> 31:26.626
Cough syrup, smack or heroin...

31:26.685 --> 31:29.291
we have a solution...

31:29.354 --> 31:31.027
You can have it

31:31.623 --> 31:33.193
Give it to your mate

31:33.258 --> 31:34.464
To your family.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.264
We will cure everyone.

31:37.229 --> 31:40.176
Madam, thank you.

31:42.701 --> 31:45.341
What did he have? Heroin?

31:45.404 --> 31:47.179
Hard to say right now.

31:47.305 --> 31:49.581
But he's been doing it for a while.

31:49.708 --> 31:50.812
Heavy dosage.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.147
No, madam.
The boys must have forced him.

31:53.378 --> 31:55.051
My Balli isn't the kind.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.186
Have you seen his hands?

31:59.117 --> 32:01.393
His veins are turning blue,
thanks to the needles.

32:02.654 --> 32:06.363
"My boy is not like that,
it's the others!"

32:08.293 --> 32:09.294
Madam...

32:10.262 --> 32:11.240
Madam...

32:13.165 --> 32:15.736
Sorry, madam. I had no idea.

32:18.136 --> 32:19.706
I was just checking, madam...

32:20.038 --> 32:21.483
Will he be able to give it up?

32:21.540 --> 32:22.678
It is up to him.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.277
And his environment.

32:24.342 --> 32:27.619
At such high dependence,
a person loses comprehension.

32:28.013 --> 32:29.651
He is my younger brother.

32:29.715 --> 32:31.717
Dad left me to raise him.

32:34.319 --> 32:36.356
After he's discharged,
bring him to my clinic.

32:36.421 --> 32:39.595
Ivlaqbool road,
opposite Rajju's mansion.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.501
We'll do our best.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.701
Okay?

32:59.711 --> 33:01.190
Hello.

33:01.346 --> 33:03.417
Stuff... Do you want stuff?

33:07.452 --> 33:09.693
Wrong number.
- Three kilos of heroin.

33:10.055 --> 33:12.160
I will not call again.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.004
Hovv much?

33:19.297 --> 33:20.708
Three thousand.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.168
Write down the address.

33:27.305 --> 33:28.545
Just a second.

33:39.484 --> 33:40.588
Birdbrain!

33:40.652 --> 33:47.297
One, ten, hundred, thousand...

33:47.359 --> 33:49.703
ten thousand!

34:06.244 --> 34:07.552
ls anyone there?

34:08.213 --> 34:13.128
Please let me talk to 
\/Ir. Brar.

34:13.518 --> 34:15.623
Ivlaninder Brar, IVIP

34:15.687 --> 34:19.225
I performed at his daughter's wedding.

34:19.424 --> 34:21.266
lam Tommy Singh.

34:21.326 --> 34:23.737
Let me talk to him.

34:27.032 --> 34:29.034
Let me talk to him.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.681
At least give me water.

34:42.614 --> 34:45.686
I should at least get water,
sister f****rs!

34:51.356 --> 34:54.337
Give me water right now!

34:54.391 --> 34:57.601
Give me water!

35:03.768 --> 35:05.304
What happened?

35:05.504 --> 35:07.415
You want to go home?

35:07.472 --> 35:08.542
Go then.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.151
The bail can happen later, sir.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.356
You're a celebrity, after all. VIP!

35:14.613 --> 35:17.594
Kartar, take out the jeep.

35:18.416 --> 35:20.555
We have to drop sir back home.

35:22.554 --> 35:23.999
This way, sir.

35:26.725 --> 35:30.639
Sister f*****r, so you are the GABRU?

35:31.730 --> 35:34.142
Sister f*****r,

35:35.734 --> 35:37.372
You are the GABRU, right?

35:45.744 --> 35:48.782
Become a man first, then a VIP.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.616
Loser!

36:27.218 --> 36:35.069
<i>Ambarsar is high, Ja/ahdhar,
Ludhiana and Moga, every burb.</i>

36:35.126 --> 36:38.573
<i>You try it too, brother,
Don't fear, don't curb.</i>

36:38.763 --> 36:46.272
<i>Daddy is high, brother is high,
Uncles are digging it oh the sly,</i>

36:46.471 --> 36:50.613
<i>Strong and the weak snort it alike
Let the white power strike.</i>

36:51.476 --> 36:53.387
We were in the 8th grade

36:53.445 --> 36:55.618
when your first song released.

36:56.314 --> 36:58.385
We are your fans since.

36:58.783 --> 37:01.161
We want to be like you.

37:01.386 --> 37:02.797
The GABRU!

37:03.521 --> 37:06.058
The first time I injected myself,

37:06.124 --> 37:09.196
I swear,
all I could see was your face!

37:11.429 --> 37:15.377
Mother f****rs!
You've killed your mother.

37:15.433 --> 37:17.504
And now you sing songs here?

37:17.569 --> 37:19.446
Aren't you ashamed!

37:22.540 --> 37:24.577
She was not giving us money.

37:25.010 --> 37:28.355
We needed to have our fi><.
What else could we do.

38:12.624 --> 38:17.664
<i>Tales of a /one/y night,</i>

38:17.729 --> 38:22.075
<i>Lone in a daze,

<i>Look what just crept up from behind</i>

38:46.591 --> 38:50.266
<i>Fear of the unknown

<i>Fear stings like a venomous snake</i>

39:04.142 --> 39:07.385
<i>Distant dreams grin at my fate.</i>

39:08.780 --> 39:13.456
<i>Fear stings like a venomous snake</i>

39:13.551 --> 39:17.055
<i>Distant dreams grin at my fate.</i>

39:19.557 --> 39:22.265
<i>The world is shrinking into a dot</i>

39:22.293 --> 39:24.569
<i>I can't breathe,
I ‘m left to rot.</i>

39:24.662 --> 39:27.142
<i>Draw me a few lines,
I beg of you.</i>

39:27.198 --> 39:29.337
<i>Let me snort happiness,
I beg of you.</i>

39:29.501 --> 39:31.708
<i>Alcohol fades ih
comparison to its high.</i>

39:31.970 --> 39:34.314
<i>I see god in my veins
When I shoot up and fly.</i>

39:34.339 --> 39:39.084
<i>My veins throbbing with desire
Just one inhale, and I'll retire</i>

39:39.144 --> 39:41.385
<i>I feel empty, I feel lone/y.</i>

39:41.546 --> 39:43.617
<i>I am agitated, I can't go on.</i>

39:44.082 --> 39:46.153
<i>My body is trembling,
My soul on fire</i>

39:46.351 --> 39:48.388
<i>Death is crooning,
Feels like my pyre</i>

39:48.653 --> 39:51.099
<i>My gul/et is dry as a bone</i>

39:51.189 --> 39:53.430
<i>Life is leaving me
One breath at a time.</i>

39:53.491 --> 39:55.994
<i>When will this misery end
When will I end?</i>

39:56.127 --> 39:58.539
<i>I run and hide
From nobody but myself.</i>

39:58.596 --> 39:59.631
I think she is the same girl...

39:59.697 --> 40:01.005
Faster!

40:13.778 --> 40:16.315
Bro, why is she running
into the fields?

41:16.307 --> 41:19.015
Kuku, stop her, sister f****r!
What is she doing?

41:19.077 --> 41:21.023
Yes, sir.
- Run... run!

41:21.079 --> 41:25.255
Ruining our stuff, b***h!

41:39.664 --> 41:42.474
Here you go, Jackie Chan.

42:02.353 --> 42:03.491
Greetings.

42:03.554 --> 42:05.158
Greetings to you too.

42:05.490 --> 42:07.492
Will you have some buttermilk?

42:21.306 --> 42:22.148
Greetings.

42:22.674 --> 42:24.051
Bhandi at your service, sir!

42:25.143 --> 42:26.781
Look at me!

42:28.580 --> 42:30.116
She is from Bihar.

42:30.415 --> 42:32.691
A labourer in Karnail Singh's farm.

42:33.484 --> 42:37.261
Such meticulous planning, the b***h!

42:38.489 --> 42:41.629
That explains the
f****g missing delivery.

42:56.140 --> 42:59.314
Let Jackie Chan have him.

42:59.477 --> 43:00.512
Let's go, sister f*****r!

43:04.549 --> 43:07.553
Listen... don't kill him.

43:08.620 --> 43:10.429
He is family.

43:10.488 --> 43:12.399
Take him to the fields.

43:18.763 --> 43:22.301
Sir, what to do with her?

43:22.634 --> 43:25.547
She isn't family, right?

43:36.047 --> 43:39.790
Child, the stuff was worth 1O million.

43:42.086 --> 43:45.693
If you wanted to throw it,

43:45.757 --> 43:48.670
then why did you steal it?

44:41.245 --> 44:44.385
Let me go.

44:44.448 --> 44:45.449
Just for a little while.

44:45.516 --> 44:46.586
It won't take long.

44:57.562 --> 44:59.701
<i>Leave me!
_ Bttth!</i>

45:05.036 --> 45:08.574
Leave me.
- Listen to me.

45:17.215 --> 45:20.992
Leave me. Let me go.

45:35.666 --> 45:37.577
Come.
- Calm down.

45:37.735 --> 45:40.409
Now grab me.

45:47.211 --> 45:48.713
Grab her.

45:50.348 --> 45:51.588
Leave me.

45:52.116 --> 45:55.757
I'll teach her a lesson.
Hold her down.

45:57.221 --> 45:59.326
e me
a
FS!

46:19.210 --> 46:21.554
"After a vvhole week..."

46:21.612 --> 46:25.185
"Tommy Singh was finally
released from prison today."

46:25.249 --> 46:28.696
"While agreeing to his bail,
the court has specified..."

46:28.753 --> 46:33.429
"that his celebrity status
shouldn't warrant any 
eniency."

46:33.491 --> 46:35.129
Move aside.

46:37.562 --> 46:39.769
- Tommy, who is the GABRU?

46:40.031 --> 46:42.068
- Where has the GABRU gone?
- Where has Tommy, the GABRU gone?

46:42.567 --> 46:45.639
At least let me get inside. Move.

46:57.014 --> 46:58.493
A single person takes to drugs.

47:00.584 --> 47:04.031
But, it affects the entire family.

47:05.056 --> 47:07.332
Initially,
drugs are taken for pleasure.

47:07.792 --> 47:12.207
Later, drugs become their life goal.
- Open the door, I beg you!

47:12.563 --> 47:16.534
Love, friends, family,
career, education...

47:16.968 --> 47:17.537
Nothing remains!

47:17.702 --> 47:21.377
What do I do with you?

47:21.672 --> 47:23.015
Leave him, Sartaj.

47:23.074 --> 47:24.678
Let him go, son. Let him go.

47:24.709 --> 47:26.154
Leave him.

47:27.478 --> 47:29.116
I'm away from home all day.

47:29.180 --> 47:30.716
Hovv do I know what's happening here?

47:30.982 --> 47:33.189
You all shou
d've
taken care of him.

47:39.724 --> 47:41.761
Everything that is
beautiful within the person,

47:43.427 --> 47:49.673
his adorations in life,
drugs finishes off everything.

47:51.636 --> 47:53.673
I am not reciting hearsay.

47:57.642 --> 47:58.746
I have seen it with my own eyes.

48:05.249 --> 48:06.592
Sign here.

48:12.089 --> 48:14.160
Mother, I want to go home.

48:14.225 --> 48:15.966
Don't worry, son.

48:16.027 --> 48:17.438
Just a little longer.

48:18.262 --> 48:20.367
Shyam, take him to the ward.

48:20.431 --> 48:22.138
Go with them, kiddo.

48:23.434 --> 48:24.538
- Thank you, Doctor.

48:25.469 --> 48:26.641
Let's go, my dear.

48:27.171 --> 48:28.514
Thank you, Madam.

48:28.572 --> 48:31.075
Now it's all up to you. Thank you.

48:33.678 --> 48:35.521
Wait a moment.
- Yes?

48:46.057 --> 48:49.630
Ne><t time, don't come here
in your uniform.

48:50.528 --> 48:51.598
Vvhy?

48:51.996 --> 48:53.304
What were you saying the other day?

48:53.464 --> 48:56.570
You weren't aware of what was
happening with your brother?

48:56.734 --> 48:59.442
Have any idea what's
happening in Jashanpura?

48:59.503 --> 49:02.416
In Amritsar? In Tarn Taran?
In all of Punjab?

49:03.140 --> 49:04.676
Do you have any idea?

49:05.142 --> 49:06.553
You're an Assistant Inspector, right?

49:06.610 --> 49:07.645
Which department?

49:08.512 --> 49:09.718
What is the matter, madam?

49:09.981 --> 49:11.551
Why are you talking to me like this?

49:11.716 --> 49:14.595
What's your 'cut'
for not having an idea?

49:15.519 --> 49:17.965
Ten thousand a week, isn't it?

49:18.022 --> 49:19.695
Then why have you got him here?

49:19.724 --> 49:22.170
Take him to a private clinic in Delhi.

49:22.226 --> 49:23.330
What is it, Madam?

49:23.394 --> 49:24.668
Because I am silent...

49:24.728 --> 49:26.366
What will you say?

49:26.631 --> 49:29.111
It doesn't bother you
to ruin a generation.

49:29.166 --> 49:30.645
But when it comes to
your brother, it hurts?

49:30.701 --> 49:32.044
Madam...

49:34.305 --> 49:36.182
This is what he's addicted to.

49:37.007 --> 49:39.578
A combination of Pheniramine
and buprenorphine.

49:40.511 --> 49:43.048
You must've seen
this bottle somewhere.

49:43.548 --> 49:45.550
Or do you have no idea about this too?

49:49.053 --> 49:51.260
They are two separate drugs...

49:51.322 --> 49:54.064
that should only be
sold with prescription.

49:54.125 --> 49:58.039
But thanks to you, the producers are
combining these drugs...

49:58.095 --> 50:00.507
and sellers are openly selling them

50:00.564 --> 50:03.238
by the name of ‘Chaancf,
in every chemist shop.

50:03.300 --> 50:05.211
For a mere 5O rupees.

50:05.402 --> 50:07.712
The price of your brother's life!

50:13.778 --> 50:15.018
It's my turn tonight.

50:15.646 --> 50:17.751
Let them go, baby.

50:18.616 --> 50:19.686
Let them go.

50:25.122 --> 50:26.032
All good?

50:27.024 --> 50:29.334
Do you want to do her?

50:32.296 --> 50:33.297
She looks good.

50:34.031 --> 50:34.509
Let go.

50:34.665 --> 50:36.804
I need to buy a phone, sir.
- Buy it ne><t time.

50:38.769 --> 50:40.077
Will you buy it for me?

50:43.107 --> 50:45.747
Sir, what are you doing?

50:45.810 --> 50:48.120
He's a regular on this route.

50:48.179 --> 50:51.092
Sir, leave him, he'll die.

50:51.615 --> 50:54.653
Leave him.
- What happened?

51:03.727 --> 51:05.229
Let it go.

51:07.097 --> 51:08.599
Are you out of your mind?

51:08.666 --> 51:11.738
It is Pehelvvan's truck, sister f****r!
Get him water.

51:14.538 --> 51:17.382
It happens. He just lost it.

51:17.441 --> 51:19.785
Hey, get him bandaged.

51:20.244 --> 51:24.454
Here, take this, go on.

51:25.049 --> 51:27.290
You leave the truck at Pehelwaws.

51:28.018 --> 51:28.553
Okay, sir.

51:29.053 --> 51:29.690
Don't mention anything to anyone.

51:30.488 --> 51:31.228
Hurry UP-

51:34.125 --> 51:35.536
There is a system.

51:35.660 --> 51:37.697
And everyone has to follow it.

51:39.029 --> 51:41.566
I can handle him being beaten up.

51:42.299 --> 51:45.303
But hovv can you damage his truck?

51:47.538 --> 51:49.415
It is Pehelvvan's truck!

51:51.208 --> 51:53.154
Pehelwan is a Member of Parliament.

51:53.544 --> 51:56.218
Yet he pays our cut. Doesn't he?

51:56.680 --> 51:58.387
He can have both of us suspended.

51:58.516 --> 52:00.257
Brother, I want to go home.

52:00.418 --> 52:02.193
Go home.

52:02.753 --> 52:04.460
Take care of Balli.

52:05.055 --> 52:05.726
Go.

52:08.626 --> 52:10.469
Whatsapp me if there is a problem.

53:01.645 --> 53:05.115
- Make it quick. There's a lot to finish.

53:06.684 --> 53:08.163
- No Issues.

53:08.285 --> 53:10.561
- Everything is in control.

53:11.355 --> 53:12.663
- No, no. It's okay.

53:13.157 --> 53:14.568
- Hey, boss is here.

53:26.203 --> 53:28.012
- Come. Have some tea.

<i>But an enemy.</i>

54:16.453 --> 54:25.373
<i>You've sent me to exile too soon.</i>

54:50.521 --> 54:52.159
Hello, baby.

54:58.295 --> 54:59.740
Baby...

55:00.431 --> 55:01.808
Look here!

55:03.700 --> 55:05.270
Look here!

55:06.136 --> 55:07.513
Smile please...

55:13.110 --> 55:14.987
It's nice.

55:16.180 --> 55:17.989
You look pretty.

55:29.660 --> 55:32.106
Tell me if you need anything.

55:33.297 --> 55:34.776
Anything for you.

55:54.084 --> 55:56.325
We've spoilt you.

56:41.064 --> 56:42.304
She is quite petite.

56:42.333 --> 56:44.006
She looked okay on the phone.

56:45.502 --> 56:46.480
New phone?

56:48.005 --> 56:50.212
Yes, sir. I bought it for 8000 rupees.

56:51.208 --> 56:54.280
Eight thousand! You aren't worth it.

56:55.779 --> 56:58.055
New phone!

57:07.624 --> 57:08.796
She won't bite, right?

57:09.493 --> 57:12.474
No, sir. She's well trained now.

58:46.423 --> 58:49.996
Hey, Tommy. My darling child!

58:50.560 --> 58:51.732
Do one thing...

58:52.129 --> 58:54.632
Just make one hit number!

58:55.198 --> 58:57.371
Just one monster hit song!

58:57.701 --> 59:01.114
And then there is that
anti-drug concert.

59:01.171 --> 59:04.448
It's the best step for our image.

59:05.042 --> 59:07.318
Will help the case too.

59:08.045 --> 59:13.358
Public will know that our Tommy
is no more into drugs.

59:13.951 --> 59:14.986
He's clean now.

59:46.016 --> 59:50.294
Told you it's not happening.

59:50.687 --> 59:51.688
Told you!

01:00:03.467 --> 01:00:05.208
Uncle...

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:10.076
I think our bro here
can probably do with some inspiration.

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:25.055
Your 'inspiration'
sent my boy to jail.

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:27.500
Novv, if you even mention it...
- I am sorry, uncle.

01:00:35.432 --> 01:00:37.173
I want to go to London.

01:00:40.504 --> 01:00:42.506
I want to go to London!

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:45.550
I have to go to London.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:47.553
You shut up!

01:00:48.712 --> 01:00:50.055
Killed your mother!

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:54.221
I want to go to London!

01:00:55.552 --> 01:00:57.463
Going to London, f*****s!

01:00:58.355 --> 01:01:00.528
Open the door, Monty.

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:03.503
I say open the door.
- Please, sir.

01:01:04.361 --> 01:01:08.138
Please, sir. Stop.

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:10.769
Please don't.
- I'll shoot!

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:13.674
No... no!
- Move away.

01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:15.683
Bro, what are you doing?
- Get out of my way.

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:18.117
I'll shoot.
- No... no!

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:20.152
Son...

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:24.420
Son, the court will decide
if you can go or not.

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:27.160
You only do your concert.

01:01:27.217 --> 01:01:29.254
I don't want to do the concert.
I want to go.

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:31.356
Please let me go, uncle.

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:32.695
Sister f****r!

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:36.167
You'll shoot me? Me?

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.699
I made you a star.

01:01:39.229 --> 01:01:43.234
Your father had abandoned you, sister f****r!.
- I want to go, uncle.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:47.510
I got your younger sister married, f****r!
- I want to go...

01:01:47.571 --> 01:01:51.178
And you'll shoot me? Shoot me!

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:52.148
Let me go.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:53.482
Shoot... shoot!

01:02:07.424 --> 01:02:09.563
- Call your mom in the morning.

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:19.178
Get up Kiddo.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:22.673
Get up, child. Easy!
- No!

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:24.575
Have the medicine.

01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:27.612
Have. You'll feel better.
- I won't!

01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:29.088
It isn't bitter.

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:30.384
Very good!

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:12.024
They're luring voters with drugs this
election, not alcohol or blankets.

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:13.993
Trucks are loaded with this stuff.

01:03:14.057 --> 01:03:17.402
Godowns are getting filled.
It's a well organised operation.

01:03:17.594 --> 01:03:20.131
Party workers will be
distributing them in every village.

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:23.771
I will drag Pehelwan
by his balls to jail.

01:03:24.568 --> 01:03:27.606
I will either lose
my job or I will get shot.

01:03:29.506 --> 01:03:32.146
You decide if you want to
take it to the media.

01:03:33.076 --> 01:03:36.080
It may get difficult to
hush the matter later.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.593
Might get your name
on all the front pages too!

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:45.695
Fighting from within the system...

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:48.534
and shouting slogans
from the sidelines...

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:50.502
You'll realise the difference
with this case, madam.

01:03:58.535 --> 01:04:01.277
Hey listen... hello!

01:04:01.772 --> 01:04:04.548
What's the point in arresting
Pehelwan alone?

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:05.709
What?

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:09.054
There is a Pehelwan sitting
in every district.

01:04:09.112 --> 01:04:09.749
So?

01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:12.186
Pehelwan is just a dealer
of these drugs.

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:14.991
The manufacturers are
the ones to be arrested.

01:04:15.052 --> 01:04:16.622
Find out about their factory.
Raid them.

01:04:16.653 --> 01:04:19.031
Madam, have you seen my uniform?

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:20.659
Hovv many stars do I have?

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:21.668
One star.

01:04:21.725 --> 01:04:23.204
What does one star mean?

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:25.638
D. 
.G.? Commissioner?

01:04:25.662 --> 01:04:27.403
I am only an Assistant.

01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:30.468
You said that this stuff is being
made to lure voters.

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:32.410
So there must be
a political connection.

01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:34.676
There is no political connection.
This is politics!

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:37.116
The sermons that you give
on TV about narco politics.

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:37.708
This is it.

01:04:37.774 --> 01:04:39.344
So many IVIPs are dealers themselves.

01:04:39.409 --> 01:04:43.653
We can shout from the rooftops,
no one will listen to us.

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:48.258
Election Commission.

01:04:49.586 --> 01:04:51.725
Elections will take place in a month.

01:04:51.755 --> 01:04:54.565
Right now, the Commission
is powerful in the state.

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:57.095
Add media pressure to that,

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.231
they'll be forced to take action.

01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:02.467
But everything has to be
done before the elections.

01:05:15.178 --> 01:05:17.215
I am sorry about yesterday.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.226
Hang on.
I just want to talk to you.

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:25.090
Sir, I am just a driver.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:26.256
From the factory to the godown,

01:05:26.323 --> 01:05:27.734
and godovvn to the factory.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:29.566
I don't know about these games.

01:05:30.594 --> 01:05:32.437
Your factory is in Barotivvala

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:34.734
near the Himachal border, isn't it?

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.539
Come, let's take a ride.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.581
No, sir. I will lose myjob.

01:05:39.703 --> 01:05:43.480
I came from my village
just to earn a living.

01:05:53.416 --> 01:05:54.793
I have to arrange for
my sister's wedding, too.

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:56.655
<i>F***k Off!</i>

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:08.342
I've been snooping around
the factory for four days, madam.

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:11.108
Inside out.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:12.507
Took lot of pics too.

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:16.415
From outside, the factory appears
to be shut for long.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:18.111
Just some guards outside.

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:21.317
Work happens in the morning shift.

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:24.382
9 AIVI through 7 PM.

01:06:24.748 --> 01:06:25.488
Covertly.

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:31.221
I searched everywhere but
I found nothing.

01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:33.259
Looked into the workshop, too.

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:34.730
Inspected the machines.

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:38.434
I saw some oil bottles there

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:40.503
but no names on them.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.602
No factory signboard either.

01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:50.275
We won't get information
about the owners from here.

01:07:04.154 --> 01:07:08.159
These are the chemicals used
to make this drug.

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:11.430
Ethanol, Hydrochloric Acid, Methyl,
Paraben, Ivlaleic Acid, Opium.

01:07:12.962 --> 01:07:14.270
They aren't easy to procure.

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:17.009
Some are imported...
and some are controlled.

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:18.302
Like Opium.

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:21.606
Only two places in India where
opium is legally manufactured...

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:24.149
Neemuch and Ghazipur.

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:27.381
Detailed paper work is required
to source opium from there...

01:07:27.744 --> 01:07:28.984
with thorough inspection.

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:31.584
Any random company
can't procure from there.

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:35.453
It is issued to licensed
pharmaceutical companies only.

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:41.396
Novv, if they are procuring such large
amounts of opium...

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:49.042
it means either a pharma company or
its employee is supplying them illegally.

01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:53.777
And they are doing all the paper
work behind a bogus company.

01:07:54.337 --> 01:07:57.750
If we find out the name of
this company and its owner

01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:01.153
we'll understand the entire
political nexus, Sana].

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:03.212
That's it. Their game will be over.

01:08:04.047 --> 01:08:05.424
I'm slow in these matters.

01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:07.688
I barely made it past college.

01:08:08.618 --> 01:08:10.359
I've been at it since four days.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:13.094
Whatever I could find, I have.

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:14.663
You can take someone's help.

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:16.203
Whose help can I take?

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:19.171
If anyone in the
department finds out...

01:08:20.196 --> 01:08:24.042
Think, Sana]. Think of something.

01:08:24.701 --> 01:08:26.270
Are you bloody mad?

01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:29.107
Only you know this chemical business.

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:31.379
Are you out of your mind? No way!

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.178
We will go after the shift is over.

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:35.051
E><cept for two watchmen,
nobody is going to be there.

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:36.323
We don't have to go today.

01:08:36.511 --> 01:08:37.582
Maybe after a couple of days.

01:08:38.081 --> 01:08:39.492
This is not my job, Sana].

01:08:40.582 --> 01:08:43.426
I am a doctor. A lady at that.

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:47.194
All the men in Punjab
are drugged out, madam.

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:49.669
Now it's up to the ladies.

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.062
You have saved Ba
i's life.

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:55.167
I won't let anything happen to you.

01:08:57.567 --> 01:08:59.706
Careful!

01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:05.075
Where is Tommy's Diet Coke?

01:09:05.108 --> 01:09:06.051
I had the Diet Coke kept.

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:08.385
Where is the Diet Coke?
- Where is the Diet Coke, sister f****r!?

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:10.417
Get the Diet Coke.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.460
This should have been put first.

01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:14.288
Careful.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.693
Get it fast.

01:09:19.087 --> 01:09:20.999
Son, it happens.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:23.535
It was cocaine's withdrawal symptom

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.071
Love you...

01:09:25.395 --> 01:09:28.238
Hug me as vvell, daddy.

01:11:34.524 --> 01:11:36.401
Hovv are you?
-A
 okay?

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:38.132
Do you want a dose?
- No.

01:11:38.194 --> 01:11:40.265
Our man's shooting up at the back.
Go join.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:42.037
I have a bad stomach.

01:11:42.098 --> 01:11:44.044
Okay then.

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:46.477
They've put us on a double shift.

01:11:46.536 --> 01:11:48.311
They think we are dogs.

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:49.339
Why don't you say something?

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:53.114
There's no point to it.
Who cares about us?

01:11:56.679 --> 01:12:01.287
Tommy! Tommy!

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:07.694
Move aside.

01:13:41.684 --> 01:13:48.226
There was an election rally at Jashanpura,
organised by Ivlaninder Bran...

01:13:48.358 --> 01:13:51.396
He addressed over thousand people...

01:13:51.494 --> 01:13:57.604
He raised the issue of
drugs ruining the youth...

01:13:57.734 --> 01:14:01.773
He appealed to the people,
asking their support in this issue.

01:14:02.238 --> 01:14:05.412
I want to tell the youth of Punjab...

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:09.248
that this whole fight,

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:11.547
this vvar on drugs,

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:15.321
is above all, an individual war.

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:19.391
We're with you in this war.

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:21.558
We are here to support you.

01:14:22.325 --> 01:14:24.703
I appeal to the the youth of Punjab,

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.574
to fight it back!

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:29.471
My dear young ones, march on!

01:14:29.532 --> 01:14:30.602
We are with you.

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:32.444
My dear young ones, march on!

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:34.440
We are with you.

01:14:46.049 --> 01:14:48.290
Hey, Kaka, Lucky, Sonu!

01:14:48.418 --> 01:14:50.796
Get up all of you!
She's running away.

01:15:58.754 --> 01:15:59.755
Found anything?

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:05.370
Look at this.

01:16:06.362 --> 01:16:08.103
They want to ruin all of Punjab.

01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:12.037
What are they on to?

01:16:18.107 --> 01:16:20.018
There is nothing here, Sana].

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:24.316
Let's look over there.

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:39.997
Come on. Let's get going.

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:42.238
Wasn't it a day off today?

01:16:46.369 --> 01:16:48.645
- Sir, the Ghazipur goods are here.

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:53.480
Sartaj, I think this
is the consignment

01:16:53.743 --> 01:16:55.780
This is what we were looking for.

01:16:56.345 --> 01:16:58.120
Do you have a safety pin?

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.393
Come out as soon as I call you. Okay?

01:17:03.519 --> 01:17:04.327
9K8)’-

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:06.798
Don't vvorry. I am here.

01:17:18.401 --> 01:17:20.574
-Be careful.

01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:25.649
- Watch it, it's heavy.

01:17:30.579 --> 01:17:31.387
- Keep it here.

01:17:31.447 --> 01:17:32.983
- Hurry.

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:36.162
- Get that here.

01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:39.028
- Faster.

01:17:44.093 --> 01:17:45.595
- Move it.

01:17:47.463 --> 01:17:49.238
<i>_ Easy. . .</i>

01:17:49.298 --> 01:17:50.777
- I got it...

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:52.376
[Opium and Alkaloids]

01:17:52.435 --> 01:17:54.108
- Move it.

01:18:03.312 --> 01:18:06.486
Good job.
Brother, please take over.

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:08.284
What happened?

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.300
What's with the power?

01:18:18.494 --> 01:18:20.269
I think the power has gone out.

01:18:20.329 --> 01:18:21.307
Even I know that.

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:22.535
The power has not gone.

01:18:22.565 --> 01:18:23.669
There are lights outside.

01:18:23.733 --> 01:18:25.041
Only our factory is blacked out.

01:18:25.101 --> 01:18:27.012
I think the fuse must have blown.

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:28.343
Why are you standing here
and talking about it?

01:18:28.404 --> 01:18:29.348
Do something.

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:30.315
Come on.
- Come.

01:18:30.373 --> 01:18:31.613
Check if there's a lose connection.

01:18:31.674 --> 01:18:33.984
Turn the damn generator on!

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:36.151
Just find some help.

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:37.589
Everything is okay here...

01:18:37.646 --> 01:18:39.250
Did you find anything?

01:18:39.315 --> 01:18:40.623
No. Everything is okay here.

01:18:41.317 --> 01:18:43.160
Turn the damn generator on!

01:18:51.694 --> 01:18:54.174
This damn power cut!

01:18:56.499 --> 01:18:58.604
Thank God, the power's back on.

01:18:58.668 --> 01:19:01.581
Everybody back to work.

01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:03.079
What was the problem?

01:19:03.139 --> 01:19:05.050
The fuse was down.

01:20:00.729 --> 01:20:02.003
Come on hurry up.

01:20:03.666 --> 01:20:04.542
Come on.

01:20:05.568 --> 01:20:06.569
Sana]. ..

01:20:07.003 --> 01:20:08.676
Sana], come on.

01:20:10.673 --> 01:20:11.743
Leave it. I'll ride.

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:14.746
Sit tight.

01:20:49.745 --> 01:20:55.423
Stop!

01:21:23.012 --> 01:21:26.357
Tommy, try the blonde look.

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.194
It will suit you.

01:21:29.151 --> 01:21:31.131
GABRU, The Great!

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.609
My hero...

01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:51.182
The crowd is in a crazy mood.

01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:53.086
Rock the show!

01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:55.348
Daddy, relax!

01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:56.549
You're adding to the pressure.

01:21:56.779 --> 01:21:59.658
What is your problem?

01:21:59.815 --> 01:22:03.592
We're just talking.
None of your business.

01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:15.231
I can't do this.

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:20.474
Ricky, enough already!

01:22:20.536 --> 01:22:23.016
You want to turn him into Lady Gaga?

01:22:23.405 --> 01:22:24.213
Funny, eh?

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:27.019
Get lost.

01:22:27.643 --> 01:22:30.021
I will thrash you.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:33.752
Brother, I understand.

01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:37.593
If there's no fuel in the car,
will it run?

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.631
Never.

01:22:40.222 --> 01:22:43.465
And our car is a
Range Rover.

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:48.098
When you drive a Range Rover,
you need more fuel.

01:22:50.733 --> 01:22:52.269
Fuel.

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:54.237
Now you tell me,

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:56.108
who's the GABRU?

01:22:56.806 --> 01:22:57.716
Say it!

01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:00.052
Get ready quickly.

01:23:00.209 --> 01:23:01.279
I am out of here.

01:23:03.179 --> 01:23:05.523
And yeah, I love you, too!

01:23:30.306 --> 01:23:31.751
Where is it?

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:36.755
Can I say something, madam?

01:23:37.446 --> 01:23:38.447
Go on.

01:23:40.249 --> 01:23:41.592
...

01:23:45.788 --> 01:23:47.062
Sana]. ..

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:49.232
I want to take you on a date.

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:50.629
Sana]. ..

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:52.437
Will you come to
a coffee shop with me?

01:23:52.628 --> 01:23:54.107
Sana]?

01:24:10.979 --> 01:24:12.652
Madam...

01:24:14.083 --> 01:24:15.756
I've never seen a lady like you.

01:24:17.253 --> 01:24:19.358
You are surrounded by filth.

01:24:20.489 --> 01:24:22.765
Yet, you are absolutely clean.

01:24:25.194 --> 01:24:26.502
Dignity.

01:24:29.331 --> 01:24:31.402
Okay. Now get up.

01:24:36.405 --> 01:24:38.749
You sitting too far away, madam.

01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:43.017
Do you know?

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:45.752
What hit me the most...

01:24:46.482 --> 01:24:51.522
Life's worst tragedy, Madam,

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:59.467
To lose someone you love,

01:25:03.532 --> 01:25:06.138
And not being able
to do anything about it.

01:25:06.468 --> 01:25:08.379
Father had passed away.

01:25:09.405 --> 01:25:11.282
If my brother had too...

01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:14.750
That day, you didn't save
him, but me instead.

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:20.120
Sana], look at me.

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:22.121
Look at me.

01:25:22.251 --> 01:25:24.663
Now show me your tongue.

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:27.995
Martyr Sartaj Singh.

01:25:29.525 --> 01:25:31.766
Nothing is going to happen to Balli.

01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:34.299
Nothing.

01:25:36.465 --> 01:25:37.671
Are you sure?

01:25:38.734 --> 01:25:40.042
Promise.

01:25:42.304 --> 01:25:45.547
Brave warrior-madam, Preet Sahni!

01:25:46.375 --> 01:25:48.412
Commander, drugs on war.

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:52.121
Not drugs on war,
vvar on drugs.

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:54.422
And I am no hero.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:56.019
I am only trying.

01:25:57.753 --> 01:26:00.359
There are two wars going on in Punjab.

01:26:01.190 --> 01:26:02.794
The one you and I are fighting

01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:06.596
against people like Pehelvvan,
against the system.

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:10.302
That is easy.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.139
The real vvar on drugs...

01:26:14.203 --> 01:26:17.275
is the one that people
like Balli are fighting.

01:26:17.573 --> 01:26:19.211
With themselves.

01:26:22.244 --> 01:26:24.383
If they win, we win.

01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:27.759
If they lose, Punjab...

01:26:30.319 --> 01:26:31.525
loses!

01:26:35.424 --> 01:26:37.768
And so, Punjab has lost!

01:26:40.262 --> 01:26:42.003
Sana]. ..

01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:43.604
What happened?

01:26:47.403 --> 01:26:49.474
Okay. Come here.

01:27:43.158 --> 01:27:45.570
Where could she be?
- Look over there!

01:28:08.117 --> 01:28:16.502
Presenting Tommy, the GABRU!

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:43.356
Bro, are you okay?

01:28:46.755 --> 01:28:49.292
Rock and roll, bro.

01:29:35.437 --> 01:29:41.319
GABRU!

01:29:57.125 --> 01:30:02.404
GABRU!

01:30:03.732 --> 01:30:05.439
Have you seen him?

01:30:06.768 --> 01:30:08.406
Has anyone seen GABRU?

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:12.609
Hovv will you see him?

01:30:15.043 --> 01:30:17.387
Some are lying in the gutters.

01:30:19.448 --> 01:30:22.224
swimming in their own vomit.

01:30:22.684 --> 01:30:25.358
And some have already
made it to the other side.

01:30:25.554 --> 01:30:26.726
Dead!

01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:29.100
Sing us a song already!

01:30:29.725 --> 01:30:32.205
I will sing a song, too.

01:30:32.461 --> 01:30:34.498
First, hear what I have to say.

01:30:35.797 --> 01:30:37.640
Meet me.

01:30:39.101 --> 01:30:41.240
Do you want to meet him?

01:30:42.404 --> 01:30:47.615
Do you want to meet
the real Tommy Singh?

01:30:49.077 --> 01:30:50.556
Statutory warning -

01:30:50.612 --> 01:30:53.559
He's no GABRU!

01:30:53.782 --> 01:30:56.285
Novv, do you want to meet him?

01:30:56.451 --> 01:31:00.627
Then... here is Tommy
Singh in 3, 2, 1...

01:31:00.822 --> 01:31:03.268
[L-O-S-E-R]

01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:07.638
This is Tommy Singh.

01:31:08.497 --> 01:31:09.567
Loser!

01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:15.445
A small town boy,
Tejender Singh Loser,

01:31:17.672 --> 01:31:22.644
Scored a visa and went to
Birmingham, once upon a time.

01:31:24.279 --> 01:31:26.782
Somehow his music worked.

01:31:27.048 --> 01:31:29.722
Otherwise, he would be driving a cab.

01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:33.124
Or waiting tables.

01:31:34.156 --> 01:31:36.762
He scraped through high school.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:41.063
He just knew one thing.

01:31:42.797 --> 01:31:44.105
Drugs.

01:31:47.269 --> 01:31:49.613
And he sang about it.

01:31:52.474 --> 01:31:55.080
And you folks thought
it was philosophy?

01:32:00.382 --> 01:32:06.298
You folks are bigger
losers than I am, f****rs!

01:32:07.089 --> 01:32:10.298
Come on, sing the song already!

01:32:10.459 --> 01:32:13.303
And you're the biggest loser,

01:32:13.395 --> 01:32:15.397
since you still don't get it!

01:32:15.463 --> 01:32:18.307
We aren't here for your sermons.

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:19.638
Sing or get lost!

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:21.078
Sing or get lost.

01:32:21.136 --> 01:32:28.486
Sing or get lost!

01:32:39.654 --> 01:32:41.361
You want to hear a song?

01:32:41.423 --> 01:32:43.096
Do you?

01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:49.702
Where's the car? F***k!

01:33:49.758 --> 01:33:51.704
Where is the Range Rover?

01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:54.137
Oh damn!

01:34:13.081 --> 01:34:15.618
He must be here somewhere.

01:34:16.184 --> 01:34:17.663
Get the car quickly.

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.421
Stay back!

01:34:44.412 --> 01:34:47.518
Let me hide.

01:34:50.118 --> 01:34:51.392
Who are you?

01:34:51.453 --> 01:34:52.557
Tommy.

01:34:52.587 --> 01:34:53.588
A dog?

01:34:53.622 --> 01:34:56.102
A singer. Tommy Singh.

01:34:57.692 --> 01:34:59.399
Please let me hide.

01:35:00.328 --> 01:35:02.205
Over there.

01:35:02.263 --> 01:35:04.470
Thank you.
- Shut up!

01:35:30.291 --> 01:35:31.599
Do you have stuff?

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.602
Who you hiding from?

01:35:42.704 --> 01:35:43.774
From myself.

01:35:44.039 --> 01:35:44.710
Huh?

01:35:45.507 --> 01:35:46.679
From myself.

01:35:48.543 --> 01:35:49.613
\/Ioron.

01:35:50.278 --> 01:35:51.689
The biggest one.

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:54.250
Not bigger than me, Tommy boy.

01:35:54.316 --> 01:35:56.023
Oh, come on!

01:35:56.084 --> 01:35:58.325
I am the champion of morons.

01:35:58.653 --> 01:36:00.655
His Highness Moron Number One.

01:36:02.791 --> 01:36:04.702
Look where I've landed up.

01:36:05.593 --> 01:36:08.130
You think I lost my way here?

01:36:08.363 --> 01:36:10.206
If you hear my story,
you'll s**t your pants.

01:36:10.332 --> 01:36:12.312
Let it be.

01:36:13.134 --> 01:36:15.045
It is even written on my head.

01:36:15.303 --> 01:36:18.682
Look.

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:20.677
Look.

01:36:26.748 --> 01:36:29.160
That's L-O-S-E-R written.
- Yes, loser.

01:36:30.218 --> 01:36:31.322
They mean the same thing.

01:36:31.386 --> 01:36:33.024
Hovv so?

01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:36.025
A loser is a loser,
a moron is a moron.

01:36:40.395 --> 01:36:42.341
That makes sense.

01:36:43.365 --> 01:36:45.606
A loser is a loser...

01:36:45.734 --> 01:36:47.577
and a moron is a moron.

01:36:57.245 --> 01:36:59.623
Wear it.

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:07.633
I was wondering...

01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:10.701
I vvont be able to do it alone.

01:37:15.163 --> 01:37:17.200
Will you commit suicide with me?

01:37:19.467 --> 01:37:20.673
Get lost!

01:37:22.637 --> 01:37:24.639
I am not that big a moron.

01:37:26.474 --> 01:37:29.284
Loser, don't you plant
these ideas in my head.

01:37:29.344 --> 01:37:30.584
Hit me. You also f***king hit me.

01:37:30.645 --> 01:37:32.056
Then why are you talking rubbish?

01:37:32.113 --> 01:37:34.457
What else should I do?

01:37:35.049 --> 01:37:37.325
Who wants to hear
the f**king right thing?

01:37:37.385 --> 01:37:40.696
They only want rubbish which
I've said for four years.

01:37:41.022 --> 01:37:42.729
Made me a pop star! The F**k!

01:37:43.124 --> 01:37:45.502
A pop star at f**king 22!

01:37:45.727 --> 01:37:48.230
Asian underground number three.

01:37:48.396 --> 01:37:50.535
Tommy, the GABRU!

01:37:50.598 --> 01:37:52.737
And now... poof!

01:37:54.602 --> 01:37:59.711
Think... if someone tells you
that your best times are over.

01:37:59.741 --> 01:38:01.379
And they won't come back.

01:38:01.442 --> 01:38:03.046
The stuff is finished.
Party over!

01:38:03.111 --> 01:38:04.419
Go home.

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:32.709
Sorry.

01:39:39.441 --> 01:39:42.718
Run away!

01:39:46.547 --> 01:39:48.083
Bloody loser!

01:39:48.383 --> 01:39:50.329
Why won't the good times come?

01:39:50.385 --> 01:39:53.127
Look what's become of me...

01:39:53.188 --> 01:39:54.531
I am no moron.

01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:56.728
Hockey champion,
district player!

01:39:56.992 --> 01:39:59.336
I thought I'd see good times
if I played state level.

01:39:59.394 --> 01:40:01.431
But my father dropped dead.

01:40:01.496 --> 01:40:02.406
When I got over that...

01:40:02.464 --> 01:40:04.466
my hockey stick was
replaced with a sickle.

01:40:04.532 --> 01:40:08.105
Left home, reached Sarhota
village to work in the farms.

01:40:08.503 --> 01:40:10.608
One day a packet flew from the skies.

01:40:10.672 --> 01:40:14.245
I thought, if I sold it,
I'd finally see good times.

01:40:14.742 --> 01:40:17.313
That's it. The biggest f**k up!

01:40:17.378 --> 01:40:18.652
I got busted, damn it!

01:40:18.713 --> 01:40:20.624
They've turned me into an animal.

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:22.183
They took turns to do me...

01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:24.593
Sometimes all motherf***rs together.

01:40:24.652 --> 01:40:28.065
Do you know what
I've been through, loser?

01:40:28.089 --> 01:40:29.568
Do you know? Do you?

01:40:37.165 --> 01:40:40.738
Besides this,
everything else.

01:40:41.803 --> 01:40:43.339
Do you understand?

01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:53.786
Let's leave.

01:41:17.305 --> 01:41:24.655
There's this big billboard
I can see from the window

01:41:27.782 --> 01:41:32.424
An ad for a Goa holiday.

01:41:36.557 --> 01:41:40.232
That's all I keep staring at
all the time, without a blink.

01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:45.739
Because I believe that,
that is my ‘good time‘.

01:41:47.168 --> 01:41:50.445
And that day will come.

01:41:50.505 --> 01:41:53.179
And when it does, I will ask it.

01:41:54.242 --> 01:41:57.223
Where were you all this while?

01:41:57.578 --> 01:42:00.787
Waiting for me to be decimated?

01:42:01.048 --> 01:42:03.050
ls that what it takes for you to come?

01:42:03.517 --> 01:42:06.259
But here I am and
I refuse to fall apart!

01:42:06.321 --> 01:42:09.564
I am standing right here!

01:42:18.466 --> 01:42:20.173
Still waiting.

01:42:26.441 --> 01:42:30.116
Your Punjab failed me, loser!

01:42:32.613 --> 01:42:35.287
I've never touched a cigarette.

01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:38.559
And now I'm hooked to the needle.

01:42:42.323 --> 01:42:44.269
Why don't you quit it?

01:42:47.662 --> 01:42:49.073
What?

01:42:50.331 --> 01:42:51.605
Punjab?

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:54.509
Or the needle?

01:42:55.537 --> 01:42:57.278
What is your name?

01:43:51.059 --> 01:43:52.231
Sana]?

01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:46.417
Punjab police filed a case against Tommy
Singh for lewd and lascivious behaviour.

01:44:46.481 --> 01:44:50.486
The court has issued a non-bailable
warrant against Tommy Singh.

01:44:50.551 --> 01:44:53.031
The Punjab government
has condemned this...

01:44:53.087 --> 01:44:56.364
and has asked for Tommy's
immediate arrest.

01:44:57.158 --> 01:45:00.537
Forgive her.
- I'm going to kill the b**h!

01:45:00.595 --> 01:45:02.370
If the boss found out....

01:45:02.563 --> 01:45:04.304
No. I will talk to her.

01:45:04.398 --> 01:45:06.036
Please forgive her.

01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:06.771
Brother...

01:45:07.035 --> 01:45:08.309
Relax, let me handle it.

01:45:08.336 --> 01:45:10.077
What is left of her anyway?

01:45:10.571 --> 01:45:13.017
She's a chewed out bone.
Let's chop and throw her.

01:45:13.074 --> 01:45:14.747
No. Let me talk to her.

01:45:15.009 --> 01:45:18.513
Assure them you won't do it again.

01:45:18.613 --> 01:45:19.683
She won't.

01:45:19.747 --> 01:45:22.159
Bunch of sister f***rs!

01:45:23.318 --> 01:45:25.264
Keep her under control.

01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:44.347
I am really mad at you.

01:45:46.307 --> 01:45:48.184
Baby, understand.

01:45:48.242 --> 01:45:50.017
You can't manage
on your ovvn.

01:45:50.711 --> 01:45:52.588
Do you know hovv
expensive heroin is?

01:45:53.747 --> 01:45:56.159
You'll have to sleep with
someone for money.

01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:58.159
Will you like that?

01:45:59.219 --> 01:46:01.563
They're only going to use you.

01:46:03.758 --> 01:46:07.296
But, Sonu loves you, baby.

01:46:08.796 --> 01:46:10.571
Baby...

01:46:14.001 --> 01:46:17.574
Don't run away again. Okay?

01:46:32.386 --> 01:46:33.330
Sana]!

01:46:34.388 --> 01:46:35.196
Come here!

01:46:36.190 --> 01:46:36.725
Look.

01:46:38.493 --> 01:46:40.564
Some Virender Singh
is behind all this.

01:46:40.761 --> 01:46:42.240
The owner of De
u><e Pharmaceuticals.

01:46:43.397 --> 01:46:45.570
De
u><e Pharmaceuticals is
the front in whose name...

01:46:45.633 --> 01:46:48.079
government controlled
opium is being sourced.

01:46:48.536 --> 01:46:49.640
It's a fake company.

01:46:50.004 --> 01:46:51.540
There is nothing about it online.

01:46:51.672 --> 01:46:53.674
The telephone numbers
also don't work.

01:46:54.408 --> 01:46:56.012
But guess what I did?

01:46:56.577 --> 01:46:58.750
I logged on to Registrar of
Companies website

01:46:59.013 --> 01:47:00.458
and found out owner details.

01:47:01.382 --> 01:47:04.124
It's some Virender Singh
from village Havelian.

01:47:04.718 --> 01:47:06.061
Who is this Virender Singh?

01:47:07.788 --> 01:47:10.268
I thought the owner would
be a big politician.

01:47:10.658 --> 01:47:11.966
I don't know.

01:47:12.426 --> 01:47:15.430
Could be a political stooge.

01:47:23.971 --> 01:47:25.041
Madam...

01:47:27.408 --> 01:47:29.445
Last night...

01:47:30.244 --> 01:47:31.382
Are you okay now?

01:47:31.446 --> 01:47:33.392
Balli, stop.

01:47:38.452 --> 01:47:40.728
Let me go.
- Wait.

01:47:43.023 --> 01:47:45.230
Chetan, hold him.

01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:47.602
Balli, listen...

01:47:56.604 --> 01:47:58.311
Thorazine, quick!

01:47:58.372 --> 01:47:59.749
Balli?

01:48:13.688 --> 01:48:15.634
Stop. Drop me here.

01:48:27.568 --> 01:48:30.174
On Radio Bollyvvood,
I am your RJ Ivlanveer.

01:48:30.237 --> 01:48:34.617
It's 9 AIVI. Tommy Singh's been
absconding for the past 12 hours.

01:48:35.076 --> 01:48:36.054
Bro, Tommy!

01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:38.421
What's going on, brother?

01:48:41.548 --> 01:48:43.619
Tommy, you have any idea...

01:48:51.058 --> 01:48:52.366
I have lots to tell you.

01:48:52.426 --> 01:48:53.029
What happened?

01:48:53.093 --> 01:48:54.367
Come with me.
- What happened?

01:48:54.595 --> 01:48:56.199
Sit down.

01:48:56.463 --> 01:48:58.170
First let's check into a hotel.

01:48:58.232 --> 01:49:00.473
I have to freshen up.

01:49:00.501 --> 01:49:03.345
I haven't eaten since last night.

01:49:03.404 --> 01:49:06.476
And there's this girl
that I have to save.

01:49:08.376 --> 01:49:11.323
For once think of someone
other than yourself, a**h**e!

01:49:11.478 --> 01:49:14.687
Do you know where my dad is, Tommy?

01:49:14.949 --> 01:49:16.519
They've put him in jail.

01:49:16.984 --> 01:49:20.488
The police must be beating him
asking him where Tommy is.

01:49:20.554 --> 01:49:22.033
If it were up to me, Tommy...

01:49:22.089 --> 01:49:24.729
I'd hand you over
to the police myself.

01:49:27.027 --> 01:49:31.100
But you do as you please,
you're on your ovvn now.

01:49:32.499 --> 01:49:33.603
And forgive me.

01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:36.273
Jassi, listen.
- I don't want to listen.

01:49:36.337 --> 01:49:37.543
It's not what you think.

01:49:37.605 --> 01:49:41.553
The girl's in deep trouble,
some heroin mafia shit.

01:49:41.609 --> 01:49:43.714
We need some money
to get her released.

01:49:43.977 --> 01:49:47.186
After that I will do
whatever you ask...

01:49:47.448 --> 01:49:48.518
Surrender.

01:49:50.217 --> 01:49:51.457
You were my hero.

01:49:52.019 --> 01:49:54.556
When you came from London,
I danced with joy.

01:49:54.621 --> 01:49:56.157
‘My cool cousin!‘
‘My cool cousin!‘

01:49:56.490 --> 01:49:58.492
Sisterf****r!
Now just look at this ‘cool cousin‘.

01:49:59.493 --> 01:50:00.665
GABRUs crew tee.

01:50:02.029 --> 01:50:03.633
I used to wear it with pride.

01:50:08.536 --> 01:50:10.675
To hell with it, sisterf***r!

01:50:12.039 --> 01:50:12.608
JassL

01:50:12.673 --> 01:50:15.586
There's no love in your heart,
only cocaine.

01:50:16.210 --> 01:50:17.553
Remember that, f****r!

01:50:17.644 --> 01:50:19.248
Listen up.
- Jassi is dead.

01:50:19.313 --> 01:50:20.223
Your uncle is dead.

01:50:20.414 --> 01:50:22.451
It's not what you think.

01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:24.427
We have to save her!

01:50:38.766 --> 01:50:41.178
Sometimes I get high
with just your touch.

01:50:46.507 --> 01:50:51.456
<i>"Girl, I am standing by your side,
Won't budge an inch even if I died."</i>

01:50:51.645 --> 01:50:56.560
<i>"Girl, I am standing by your side,
Won't budge an inch even if I died."</i>

01:50:56.817 --> 01:50:59.627
<i>For you, my white angel,
I quit the white powder</i>

01:50:59.653 --> 01:51:02.099
Hide me, don't let me cower.

01:51:02.256 --> 01:51:04.463
<i>For you, my white angel,
I quit the white powder,</i>

01:51:04.525 --> 01:51:07.062
Hide me, don't let me cower.

01:51:11.332 --> 01:51:13.437
Sir, we've reached Sarhota.

01:51:13.567 --> 01:51:15.672
ls this Sarhota?
- Yes.

01:51:27.281 --> 01:51:29.625
There this girl, from your village.

01:51:30.084 --> 01:51:31.062
Which block?

01:51:31.618 --> 01:51:32.722
Don't know.

01:51:33.754 --> 01:51:34.789
Name?

01:51:35.222 --> 01:51:36.257
Don't know that either.

01:51:37.425 --> 01:51:39.632
Idiots get me riled,
early in the morning!

01:51:41.028 --> 01:51:42.598
She may be from Bihar.

01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:44.472
From Bihar?

01:51:45.533 --> 01:51:50.380
Maybe at Karnail Singh's fields?
Lot of women from Bihar work there.

01:51:51.805 --> 01:51:53.341
She ran away.

01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:55.515
Didn't even take her stuff along.

01:51:56.143 --> 01:51:58.384
Who did she go with?

01:51:58.646 --> 01:51:59.681
Do you know anything?

01:52:00.514 --> 01:52:02.221
No idea, sir.

01:52:02.282 --> 01:52:04.523
She was the silent type.

01:52:04.685 --> 01:52:06.392
Her name?

01:52:07.087 --> 01:52:09.067
She had a strange name.

01:52:10.057 --> 01:52:13.038
Pushpa, what was
the hockey girl's name?

01:52:13.093 --> 01:52:16.336
What do I know?
I used to call her 'birdbrain'.

01:52:43.256 --> 01:52:46.203
Who is the dealer over here?

01:52:47.194 --> 01:52:48.264
Te

01:52:49.630 --> 01:52:54.375
You can take some from me if you want.

01:52:54.434 --> 01:52:57.677
Supply is down.

01:52:58.238 --> 01:52:59.273
Cut it outl!

01:53:02.576 --> 01:53:04.146
What happened?

01:53:04.711 --> 01:53:08.124
Our dealer,
Bhandi, is in the hospital.

01:53:09.283 --> 01:53:13.561
His gang beat him up over a bad deal.

01:53:15.355 --> 01:53:18.336
Okay then, have a nice day!

01:53:19.059 --> 01:53:22.131
Holy shit! Doesn't he
lookjust like Tommy?

01:53:22.329 --> 01:53:24.434
Yeah, bro!

01:53:24.765 --> 01:53:26.711
[GABRU]

01:53:54.795 --> 01:53:59.107
Why would an MD of a pharma
company live here?

01:54:00.367 --> 01:54:02.278
You listening?

01:54:02.336 --> 01:54:03.337
Praise the lord!

01:54:10.277 --> 01:54:11.517
That's a nice house.

01:54:11.579 --> 01:54:13.456
Grace of God.

01:54:15.182 --> 01:54:17.219
Mobiles don't work in our village.

01:54:17.417 --> 01:54:19.454
But I have a phone at home.

01:54:20.054 --> 01:54:23.160
You can speak to Virender
if you want

01:54:23.223 --> 01:54:24.258
No, that's fine.

01:54:24.425 --> 01:54:26.598
Since we were around,
we thought we'd say hello.

01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:28.037
It's been a while.

01:54:29.229 --> 01:54:30.503
What's he up to these days?

01:54:30.664 --> 01:54:32.507
Same. Driving.

01:54:32.566 --> 01:54:33.704
Private car?

01:54:33.734 --> 01:54:38.046
Yes. With Amar Pal Singh.

01:54:41.742 --> 01:54:44.746
\/Ir. Brar's son-in-law.

01:54:45.713 --> 01:54:47.124
Ivlaninder Brar?

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:48.318
Yes.

01:54:48.381 --> 01:54:50.327
I remember.

01:54:50.384 --> 01:54:53.160
Virender had mentioned
that they are like family

01:54:53.654 --> 01:54:56.134
Hey, get the family album.

01:55:03.264 --> 01:55:08.373
\/Ir. Brar's entire family had danced
at my son's wedding.

01:55:10.137 --> 01:55:12.413
There was so much pomp.

01:55:14.608 --> 01:55:16.178
Virender is looking so good.

01:55:16.243 --> 01:55:17.347
Of course.

01:55:18.245 --> 01:55:19.315
We must be going.

01:55:50.077 --> 01:55:52.023
Left from here.
- Yes.

01:55:54.048 --> 01:55:55.459
Oh no.

01:55:59.653 --> 01:56:01.064
What happened?

01:56:01.789 --> 01:56:03.530
Police.

01:56:14.501 --> 01:56:15.377
Greetings.

01:56:15.436 --> 01:56:16.676
What is it?

01:56:17.304 --> 01:56:18.977
Hovv is everything?
- All good.

01:56:19.005 --> 01:56:20.985
I was saying...

01:56:21.041 --> 01:56:23.453
Get out of here, bloody junkies!

01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:24.250
Get lost!

01:56:24.311 --> 01:56:26.018
Relax, will you.

01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:27.218
What happened to the boy?

01:56:27.281 --> 01:56:31.320
I think he's got an attack.

01:56:37.257 --> 01:56:39.635
Doctor!

01:56:49.403 --> 01:56:51.440
Don't hit me more.

01:56:51.505 --> 01:56:53.746
No. Don't vvorry. Be quiet.

01:56:54.107 --> 01:56:55.711
I am your brother.

01:56:56.043 --> 01:56:59.286
Your brother's been beaten
to pulp, my man.

01:56:59.346 --> 01:57:01.087
I know, bro. I know.

01:57:01.148 --> 01:57:02.456
But there this girl.

01:57:02.515 --> 01:57:05.519
F***rs fed me to Jackie.

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:07.064
Listen to me.

01:57:07.121 --> 01:57:09.067
F****r, chewed out my bones.

01:57:09.122 --> 01:57:09.998
Bloody listen!

01:57:10.057 --> 01:57:13.630
This girl from Bihar who is in
trouble with the heroin mafia.

01:57:13.693 --> 01:57:16.503
It's very important that I meet her.

01:57:16.964 --> 01:57:20.434
I've never done anything for anyone.

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:22.707
Let me do this once.

01:57:23.036 --> 01:57:24.071
It'll set me free.

01:57:28.475 --> 01:57:32.287
Sorry. Listen to me.

01:57:32.346 --> 01:57:33.347
Listen to me.

01:57:33.413 --> 01:57:37.987
After a long time,
there's a tune in my head.

01:57:39.153 --> 01:57:41.394
And it is thanks to the girl.

01:57:42.022 --> 01:57:44.525
Ever since I've met her,

01:57:45.092 --> 01:57:47.470
I just don't feel like taking cocaine.

01:57:48.128 --> 01:57:51.132
I've got my 'mojo' back.

01:57:51.197 --> 01:57:54.201
You know mojo, man. It's back!

01:57:55.502 --> 01:57:56.742
Tommy?
- Yes.

01:57:57.004 --> 01:57:57.505
Tommy.

01:57:57.637 --> 01:57:59.310
Dude.

01:57:59.372 --> 01:58:00.407
Where is the girl?
- THE Tommy.

01:58:00.474 --> 01:58:02.579
Where is the girl?

01:58:04.544 --> 01:58:05.454
Sing me a song.

01:58:05.512 --> 01:58:06.513
Just one song.
- Who is inside?

01:58:06.579 --> 01:58:07.683
I can't sing here.

01:58:07.748 --> 01:58:09.523
It'll make me feel lot better.

01:58:10.984 --> 01:58:11.485
Tell me.

01:58:11.552 --> 01:58:13.225
Sing-

01:58:14.488 --> 01:58:16.024
You'll have to tell me then!

01:58:16.056 --> 01:58:17.228
Sure.

01:58:18.091 --> 01:58:20.230
Just one song!
- Okay, calm down!

01:58:23.397 --> 01:58:31.509
<i>A girl whose name is Love,</i>

01:58:32.472 --> 01:58:41.256

01:59:21.154 --> 01:59:22.997

01:59:29.363 --> 01:59:31.104
Catch him.

01:59:31.131 --> 01:59:33.042
Don't let him get away.

01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:34.306
I won't spare you today.

01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:54.329

<i>Warmth, like Mary's embrace</i>

02:00:58.818 --> 02:01:06.464

<i>Tall as a cypress in winter,</i>

02:01:23.377 --> 02:01:30.226
<i>Young as a budding ember.</i>

02:01:30.717 --> 02:01:38.636
Yet she knows what the eyes speak.

02:01:43.596 --> 02:01:50.605
<i>A girl whose name is Love,</i>

02:01:50.770 --> 02:01:56.550

Let's give the Election commission
a couple of days.

02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:20.234
If nothing happens,
we will approach the media.

02:03:20.427 --> 02:03:22.270
But I am sure, it'll work out.

02:03:24.364 --> 02:03:25.775
Thank you, madam.

02:03:27.467 --> 02:03:30.448
Whenever I'll look into the
mirror to tie my turban...

02:03:31.438 --> 02:03:33.543
l'll feel a little less ashamed.

02:03:40.546 --> 02:03:42.548
Okay... ta ta!

02:03:50.724 --> 02:03:53.068
Madam, I've been wanting
to say something

02:03:53.226 --> 02:03:54.432
I messed it up that evening.

02:03:55.395 --> 02:03:58.342
The thing is that... you are so...

02:04:01.301 --> 02:04:03.247
You are so perfect that...

02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:08.144
Ta ta!

02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:25.001
Sartaj. Sartaj, wait up.

02:04:29.729 --> 02:04:32.335
Tomorrow when we're done...

02:04:32.432 --> 02:04:34.241
do you want to have coffee with me?

02:04:35.735 --> 02:04:37.112
At a cafe?

02:04:39.272 --> 02:04:41.047
You came all the way
to ask me this?

02:04:41.541 --> 02:04:42.519
Yes.

02:04:46.479 --> 02:04:47.389
9K8)’-

02:04:48.214 --> 02:04:49.249
Okay?

What happened, kiddo?

02:05:32.091 --> 02:05:34.469
The water is over. I am thirsty.

02:05:34.594 --> 02:05:37.234
Thirsty? What did you
have for dinner?

02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:40.135
Give me yourjug.

02:05:40.333 --> 02:05:42.006

Give it to me.

02:05:49.275 --> 02:05:50.754
This is not a toy.

02:05:51.478 --> 02:05:52.684
This is not a toy.

02:05:53.379 --> 02:05:55.017
Some one will get hurt.

02:05:55.515 --> 02:05:56.789
Give it to me.

02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:32.389
Everything okay’?

Kiddo, let's go in.

Listen to me, Balli.

02:06:48.768 --> 02:06:54.480
Let me go.

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:37.221
Motherf****r! Were you

02:08:45.084 --> 02:08:46.620
You haven't told anyone, right?

02:08:46.686 --> 02:08:48.188
Hovv can you say that, sir?

02:08:48.254 --> 02:08:49.733
Your cousin is my cousin.

02:09:17.183 --> 02:09:19.459
It's okay... Don't stress.

02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:22.290
Your brother, Jujhar is here.

02:09:23.389 --> 02:09:25.300
There's a safe-house in Sultanpura.

02:09:26.359 --> 02:09:28.305
Go underground there for some time.

02:09:30.463 --> 02:09:32.204
Don't lose hope.

02:09:33.466 --> 02:09:34.308
Alright?

02:09:35.501 --> 02:09:36.571
Nopi.

02:09:38.271 --> 02:09:38.681
Sir.

02:09:38.738 --> 02:09:40.615
Take him to the safe-house.

02:09:41.073 --> 02:09:42.017
I'll inform them.

02:09:42.075 --> 02:09:42.985
Okay, let's go.

02:10:07.566 --> 02:10:09.068
Hold her head.

02:10:11.370 --> 02:10:13.111
Come on.

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:14.742
Switch on the light.
- Yes sir.

02:10:15.108 --> 02:10:16.416
I'll create a crime scene here.

02:10:16.475 --> 02:10:19.217
You wash the blood outside. Quick!

02:10:37.196 --> 02:10:38.675
Where are you?

02:10:38.731 --> 02:10:40.677
Sorry, I was riding.

02:10:42.134 --> 02:10:42.669
- What happened?

02:10:42.802 --> 02:10:44.281
Come to the clinic.

02:10:44.337 --> 02:10:46.078
Balli has created a mess.

02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:26.221
M otherf****r!

02:11:43.062 --> 02:11:45.736
Be careful. The floor is wet.

02:12:27.773 --> 02:12:29.275
M otherf****r!

02:14:24.056 --> 02:14:33.101
Today, a large number of Punjab youth
is in drug addiction.

02:14:33.198 --> 02:14:39.376
Many house have
at least one drug addict.

02:14:40.406 --> 02:14:49.622
Sir, if this vicious narco-politics
is not stopped,

02:14:50.249 --> 02:14:54.163
Punjab will soon become like Me><ico.

02:14:55.121 --> 02:14:58.068
I hear that Mexican
girls are really hot.

02:14:58.124 --> 02:15:00.764
J Lo... Jennifer Lopez.

02:15:01.026 --> 02:15:04.166
Such a derriere can be found only
in Mexico, or in Punjab.

02:15:04.230 --> 02:15:05.607
Really?
- Isn't it?

02:15:09.134 --> 02:15:10.204
<i>Fmw»? _</i>

02:15:14.707 --> 02:15:20.157
You shou
d've at least kept
my name out of the list.

02:15:22.314 --> 02:15:23.520
Mine's there, too.

02:15:25.484 --> 02:15:29.364
As kid brothers, we weren't shy to
even show each others‘ d**ks.

02:15:31.357 --> 02:15:35.203
I got you this job.
I helped you keep it too.

02:15:37.063 --> 02:15:39.043
And you betrayed me for that b***h?

02:15:42.067 --> 02:15:43.512
It's not about you or me.

02:15:44.704 --> 02:15:45.774
Then who is it about?

02:15:48.241 --> 02:15:49.151
Punjab.

02:15:49.575 --> 02:15:52.317
F****r, you think
Punjab belongs to your daddy?

02:15:55.314 --> 02:15:57.021
M otherf****r!

02:15:57.617 --> 02:15:58.618
Son...

02:15:59.585 --> 02:16:01.326
Too late to save now...

02:16:02.421 --> 02:16:05.630
Lands are dry and kids are high.

02:16:32.384 --> 02:16:34.192
Good morning, baby.

02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:35.763
Bed tea for...

02:16:36.254 --> 02:16:37.632
What are you doing?

02:18:09.147 --> 02:18:10.525
Don't shoot.

02:20:00.993 --> 02:20:01.562
There's a dog there.

02:20:01.626 --> 02:20:03.003
Come this way.

02:20:05.130 --> 02:20:05.767
Be careful.

02:20:25.050 --> 02:20:27.462
Hey you... em!

02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:30.322
At least tell me your name.

02:21:36.655 --> 02:21:39.135
ls the Sultanpura massacre
leading to a can of worms?

02:21:39.224 --> 02:21:40.498
What's in that file at crime scene...

02:21:40.559 --> 02:21:43.665
that's got Punjab government
to swing into action?

02:21:43.795 --> 02:21:47.675
An Enquiry Committee has
been set up against IVIP Brar.

02:21:47.733 --> 02:21:54.742
I beg the media not to drag
my family in this matter.

02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:57.377
Why speculate the
involvement of my family?

02:21:57.609 --> 02:22:00.453
Sir... Sir!

02:22:01.780 --> 02:22:04.158
Tommy, hovv are you?

02:22:04.215 --> 02:22:07.219
Let it be.
You don't miss me.

You are busy in jail, too?

02:22:09.221 --> 02:22:17.367
<i>‘The weather is crazy today. '</i>

02:22:18.263 --> 02:22:23.235
What is this green stuff?

02:22:23.302 --> 02:22:25.282
Get me some buttermilk.

02:22:34.646 --> 02:22:36.489
I don't understand her, too.

02:22:36.548 --> 02:22:39.119
Remember,
a brother before a lover. Okay?

02:22:40.552 --> 02:22:42.088
He is asking your name.

02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:53.407
