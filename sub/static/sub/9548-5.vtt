I've acquired a target, sir.
5,200 yards.

00:19.498 --> 00:22.231
- Bearing?
- Zero-three-five relative.

00:22.394 --> 00:24.720

Weps, get me a firing solution.

00:32.215 --> 00:33.608
- Did you find him?
- No, sir.

00:33.744 --> 00:35.860
You can't find the second-in-command?

00:36.517 --> 00:37.918
How far can he be?

00:38.391 --> 00:40.851
- We're on a submarine.
- I just tried his cabin.

00:40.971 --> 00:42.185
The door's locked.

00:44.559 --> 00:46.374
Chief,
take the conn.

00:46.909 --> 00:49.197
Skipper's off the conn.
Cobb has the conn.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.146
Lieutenant Pierce?

00:59.266 --> 01:01.273
It's captain Whitaker.
Are you all right?

01:09.585 --> 01:10.322
Wait.

01:22.483 --> 01:23.365
He's dead.

I was afraid you wouldn't rember me.

02:40.904 --> 02:43.095
I don't. I just love a man in uniform.

02:44.076 --> 02:46.338
Steven Albright, you look great.

02:47.538 --> 02:49.046
You look better than great.

02:50.559 --> 02:52.438
Well, here, come in.
Come in.

02:52.558 --> 02:55.608
Gosh, how long's it been,
like, nine years?

02:55.728 --> 02:56.994
Nine and a half...

02:57.955 --> 03:01.137
- Since the, memorial service.
- Yeah.

03:03.046 --> 03:04.479
This can't be Julie.

03:05.464 --> 03:07.740
- God, she's beautiful.
- Yeah, she is beautiful.

03:07.860 --> 03:10.178
- A little too beautiful.
- Is she here?

03:10.370 --> 03:12.734
No, she's with my mom for two weeks.
Camp Grandma.

03:18.445 --> 03:19.910
Really is great to see you.

03:20.430 --> 03:21.158
Yeah.

03:21.596 --> 03:23.039
I didn't expect...

03:23.159 --> 03:24.159
I mean...

03:26.638 --> 03:27.904
This is my boss.

03:28.137 --> 03:29.795
This is Adrian Monk.
Mr. Monk,

03:29.957 --> 03:33.023
this is Steve Albright.
Lieutenant Albright.

03:33.151 --> 03:35.439
- He is one of Mitch's oldest friends.
- Hello.

03:36.107 --> 03:39.555
Actually, Mr. Monk,
you're the real reason i'm here.

03:39.804 --> 03:41.887
- Yeah.
- I've heard a lot about you.

03:42.752 --> 03:43.991
I've got a problem.

03:44.566 --> 03:45.707
Here, sit down.

03:52.491 --> 03:54.025
I don't know how to begin. I've

03:54.230 --> 03:56.405
never actually spoken
to a detective before.

03:56.567 --> 03:59.768
Well, you can speak to Mr. Monk the
same way you speak to a normal person.

04:00.781 --> 04:03.453
A close friend of mine,
Jason Pierce, died last week.

04:04.099 --> 04:05.156
I'm sorry.

04:05.617 --> 04:08.166
He was the XO...
The second in command on our boat.

04:08.726 --> 04:12.044
They said he committed suicide.
They said he'd been drinking. They found

04:12.278 --> 04:14.916
a bottle of vodka in his cabin
and there was alcohol in his blood.

04:15.036 --> 04:16.620
But you don't believe it?

04:16.754 --> 04:18.019
No, sir, I don't.

04:18.370 --> 04:20.303
Jason had been sober for nine years.

04:20.565 --> 04:23.206
He had a physical three weeks ago,
which I administered.

04:23.326 --> 04:26.348
I'm the ship's medical Officer.
There was no alcohol in his blood.

04:27.006 --> 04:29.600
Well, people do have relapses.
You know, they

04:30.102 --> 04:31.430
fall off the wagon.

04:31.581 --> 04:33.063
Not Jason. I don't believe it.

04:36.652 --> 04:38.133
Sorry,
go on.

04:38.700 --> 04:40.820
There was one other thing.
I saw him the night before.

04:40.940 --> 04:43.316
We made plans to go to a Giants game
while we were here.

04:43.614 --> 04:44.687
He seemed fine.

04:45.268 --> 04:47.403
I assume there was an investigation.

04:47.945 --> 04:49.118
Yes,
of course.

04:49.529 --> 04:51.169
NCIS ruled it a suicide.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.005
Mr. Monk, I know you're a busy man.

04:56.275 --> 04:58.137
We're only in port for one day.

04:58.257 --> 05:00.997
I wonder if you could come down
to the boat and take a look around.

05:01.775 --> 05:02.618
I just...

05:03.014 --> 05:04.358
I wanna know if I'm crazy.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.364
Well, of course we can.
I'll get my purse.

05:07.484 --> 05:10.934
Well, you mean now, today?
I can't today.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.016
Why not?

05:12.640 --> 05:14.927
Here's the thing.
It it's a boat,

05:15.047 --> 05:17.863
- and I really don't do boats.
- Mr. Monk, I've been on these boats.

05:17.995 --> 05:20.649
These boats are so big
they don't even feel like boats.

05:20.769 --> 05:22.067
They're like islands.

05:22.187 --> 05:24.812
You've been on Islands before, right?
You like Islands.

05:24.932 --> 05:26.311
- No.
- It's like Hawaii.

05:26.434 --> 05:28.601
Think of it like that.
We're goin'to Hawaii.

05:29.483 --> 05:31.109
I believe you are the devil.

05:39.491 --> 05:41.505
- Nice belt.
- Thanks.

05:41.625 --> 05:44.137
Julie made it for mother's day.
It's supposed to be good luck.

05:48.012 --> 05:51.230
Nobody shaking hands. Everybody's
saluting. Maybe I should enlist.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.620
No, Mr. Monk. Please don't enlist.
Don't even joke about it.

05:53.740 --> 05:55.682
- Why not?
- Because I love America.

05:56.290 --> 05:57.290
Here she is.

06:10.039 --> 06:12.016
My...
God!

06:12.753 --> 06:14.801
- Where's the rest of her?
- That's it.

06:14.945 --> 06:17.055
- Is she sinking?
- No, sir.

06:17.339 --> 06:18.777
That's the USS Seattle.

06:18.956 --> 06:20.547
She's a class-four submarine.

06:22.291 --> 06:23.168
Are you okay?

06:23.288 --> 06:26.699
Submarine. You said boat. You distinctly
said boat. Natalie, you were there.

06:26.819 --> 06:28.596
- We call her a boat.
- It's not a boat,

06:28.724 --> 06:31.755
It's the opposite of a boat.
You familiar with the word "float"?

06:31.875 --> 06:34.577
Mr. Monk, we're already here.
How about this? Three minutes,

06:34.707 --> 06:37.450
we just go on board and look around.
What could happen in 3 minutes?

06:37.570 --> 06:39.875
Asphyxiation, cerebral hypoxia,

06:39.995 --> 06:43.186
- gas embolism, epstein-barr.
- You know about this stuff than I do.

06:43.306 --> 06:45.463
Why can't I do it from here?
I'll just look in a window.

06:45.591 --> 06:48.354
It's a submarine.
There are no windows. Please,

06:48.929 --> 06:50.348
I'm saying please.

06:51.012 --> 06:52.652
He's Mitch's oldest friend.

06:55.033 --> 06:55.989
Three minutes.

06:56.109 --> 06:58.820
Three minutes,
180 seconds, on and off, I promise.

07:06.138 --> 07:07.431
Do you have a stopwatch?

07:07.712 --> 07:08.551
Yes, sir.

07:11.707 --> 07:13.969
You got it. Just two more steps.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.594
There you go.

07:19.967 --> 07:22.510
Sir, you don't have to hold your breath.
There's plenty of air.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.836
- How much time?
- 15 seconds.

07:26.955 --> 07:29.494
- I'm pretty sure he killed himself.
- How do you know?

07:29.627 --> 07:32.517
I've been on board 15
seconds and I'm suicidal.

07:32.637 --> 07:33.703
It's down here.

07:36.006 --> 07:37.113
How much time?

07:37.398 --> 07:38.441
35 seconds.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.991
- Mr. Monk, be brave.
- Why, what's in it for me?

07:42.593 --> 07:43.820
It happened in here.

07:45.615 --> 07:47.252
This is just how we found him.

07:48.166 --> 07:49.971
They still haven't fixed the lock.

08:02.187 --> 08:04.215
- You're not even looking.
- Yes, I am.

08:04.335 --> 08:06.184
I'm squinting so I can see better.

08:06.304 --> 08:08.272
- Mr. Monk.
- Okay, all right.

08:08.736 --> 08:10.758
Commander Whitaker
called a surprise drill.

08:11.084 --> 08:12.285
The XO didn't report.

08:12.670 --> 08:14.664
Commander and I came
down here to find him.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.503
- When we got here, we heard a gunshot.
- A gunshot...

08:18.829 --> 08:20.300
From inside the room.

08:20.747 --> 08:22.212
The locked room.

08:23.162 --> 08:23.929
Yes, sir.

08:26.963 --> 08:28.983
Commander Whitaker kicked down the door.

08:29.515 --> 08:32.058
Jason was over there
on the floor.

08:32.744 --> 08:34.700
Where were the keys to the cabin?

08:35.288 --> 08:37.821
- In his pocket.
- And who else had a copy?

08:38.919 --> 08:39.724
No one.

08:41.596 --> 08:44.857
Okay. Look, I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
I really...

08:45.198 --> 08:46.939
I really am.
But I just...

08:47.718 --> 08:50.137
I just don't see
anything

08:50.969 --> 08:52.461
here that would suggest...

08:56.133 --> 08:57.198
Tweezers.

08:58.444 --> 08:59.381
Tweezers.

09:10.601 --> 09:11.736
What is that?

09:12.672 --> 09:13.442
Plastic.

09:19.196 --> 09:21.842
Looks like it has
some adhesive on it.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.898
Maybe from duct tape.

09:25.596 --> 09:27.402
- Gunpowder.
- What does it mean?

09:28.402 --> 09:30.393
I don't know. Probably nothing.

09:33.635 --> 09:35.208
Sailor, what's going on?

09:35.328 --> 09:37.079
We're shippin'out.
Fleet-wide ASW.

09:37.954 --> 09:40.457
It's a drill.
An emergency exercise.

09:43.461 --> 09:45.186
He said we're shipping out?

09:45.626 --> 09:48.411
- Deck is clear. Secure the hatch.
- Secure the hatch.

09:48.914 --> 09:50.115
Submerge the boat.

09:50.835 --> 09:52.421
Depth two-five-zero feet.

09:52.541 --> 09:56.166
Two-five-zero feet. Aye, aye, sir.
Chief of the watch on the one MC.

09:57.033 --> 09:57.738
Dive.

10:14.776 --> 10:17.273
For the love of god,
where's the exit?

10:28.028 --> 10:30.939
- Open that hatch! That's an order!
- I don't think so.

10:31.059 --> 10:32.783
Sir!
Sir!

10:33.127 --> 10:34.855
We're underwater, sir.
It's too late.

10:34.975 --> 10:36.383
It's okay.
It's okay.

10:38.536 --> 10:39.954
Okay.
All right.

10:41.699 --> 10:43.182
Sir! Don't

10:43.689 --> 10:44.350
Sir!

10:45.016 --> 10:46.225
This guy...

10:56.770 --> 11:00.113
<i>- Helm steer zero-five-zero.</i>
- Five degrees down bubble.

11:00.233 --> 11:03.057
Helm zero-nine-zero.
Five degrees down bubble.

11:06.371 --> 11:08.989
- Identify yourself.
- M... me?

11:11.689 --> 11:12.586
I'm a...

11:13.376 --> 11:14.209
god.

11:14.329 --> 11:16.060
- Adrian.
- Adri... I know.

11:16.773 --> 11:18.001
Adrian Monk.

11:18.443 --> 11:20.767
And this is Natalie Teeger,
my former assistant.

11:21.738 --> 11:23.681
Lieutenant,
what the hell's going on here?

11:23.811 --> 11:27.141
- That's an excellent question.
- Sir, as I mentioned, I had

11:27.657 --> 11:30.567
some questions about lt.
Commander Pierce's death.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.224
Mr. Monk is a highly
decorated detective.

11:33.364 --> 11:35.617
I thought while we were
here in San Francisco that...

11:35.737 --> 11:37.460
Commander,
sir.

11:37.982 --> 11:39.958
- May I say something?
- No, you may not.

11:40.078 --> 11:43.610
What the hell are they doing on my ship
in the middle of a fleet-wide exercise?

11:43.730 --> 11:45.234
I have that same question.

11:45.554 --> 11:47.473
I wanted them to see
the crime scene, sir.

11:47.593 --> 11:49.480
There isn't a crime scene.
Lieutenant,

11:49.600 --> 11:51.744
I sent you a copy of the NCIS report.

11:51.864 --> 11:54.169
Apparently you haven't
had a chance to read it.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.540
- Commander, sir?
- Yes.

11:55.728 --> 11:56.956
You're obviously

11:57.386 --> 11:59.469
very busy turning knobs and

12:00.252 --> 12:01.606
up-periscoping.

12:02.024 --> 12:05.372
Why don't you just drop us off
and we will be out of your hair.

12:05.867 --> 12:06.934
How about...

12:07.675 --> 12:09.325
Right there, seal beach?

12:09.523 --> 12:12.352
- Right there? We could take a taxi.
- No, actually, Fisherman's wharf...

12:12.472 --> 12:14.652
It's a little bit closer.
If it's not out of your way.

12:14.777 --> 12:17.216
- We could turn back around this way...
- We are not

12:17.344 --> 12:19.440
turning around for anything.

12:19.834 --> 12:23.708
This is a fleet-wide
attack-submarine-warfare exercise.

12:24.066 --> 12:26.766
For all intents and purposes,
this ship is at war.

12:27.408 --> 12:28.789
Do you understand that?

12:29.311 --> 12:30.336
Yes, okay.

12:30.524 --> 12:33.014
I... Yes, I get...
How much do you want?

12:33.273 --> 12:35.394
She'll pay 'cause her father is loaded.

12:35.688 --> 12:38.855
You've heard of Davenport toothpaste?
That's the one with the girl who...

12:38.987 --> 12:41.381
I've finished talking.
You are now the guests

12:41.534 --> 12:44.217
of the united States Navy until
the completion of this exercise.

12:44.337 --> 12:46.059
- Thank you.
- Four, maybe five days.

12:46.221 --> 12:47.904
D...
days?

12:49.190 --> 12:50.318
Comin'about!

12:50.438 --> 12:52.066
- Blinker, blinker!
- What's he doing?

12:52.186 --> 12:54.311
Comin'about!
Blinker, blinker, blinker.

12:54.431 --> 12:55.614
That's the sonar.

12:55.899 --> 12:58.741
- You're turning the sonar tower.
- Okay, I didn't wanna bring this up,

12:58.869 --> 13:01.507
but I am a taxpayer
and that means that you,

13:01.627 --> 13:05.201
sir, work for me, and I am ordering
you to turn around and take us home!

13:08.993 --> 13:10.707
Okay, I'm not ordering, i'm asking.

13:10.827 --> 13:14.518
Please, please, you don't know him.
Sir, he can't handle this.

13:14.650 --> 13:17.721
Confined quarters like this underwater?
He's gonna crack any second.

13:17.843 --> 13:20.131
I'm surprised he's even
hanging on a little bit.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.972
Lieutenant, why don't you take
your friends to the Officers'ward room?

13:24.209 --> 13:25.704
You and I can talk later.

13:27.476 --> 13:28.754
Mr. Monk, it's okay.

13:30.023 --> 13:33.102
Baby steps...
Left, right, left...

13:33.230 --> 13:34.495
I'm sorry.

13:35.874 --> 13:37.842
It doesn't feel

13:37.962 --> 13:41.395
like a man-made boat or a submarine.

13:42.428 --> 13:44.307
Feels like a living thing.

13:44.661 --> 13:46.003
Like a beast.

13:46.763 --> 13:48.169
And I'm in...

13:48.549 --> 13:51.399
In the lungs or the stomach.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.673
It's like it's swallowed me whole.

13:54.793 --> 13:57.700
I feel like it's digesting me.

13:58.981 --> 14:00.123
Honestly,

14:00.860 --> 14:02.815
I don't know what I'd do

14:03.453 --> 14:04.701
if you weren't here.

14:05.285 --> 14:07.559
Yes, it's quite fortuitous.

14:08.050 --> 14:11.616
I heard you were on a submarine,
and I thought you could use my help.

14:12.022 --> 14:15.383
So I climbed on board just
as the ship was going underwater.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.856
What do we do now?

14:23.221 --> 14:25.023
We're gonna take it one day at a time.

14:25.413 --> 14:28.640
One hour at a time.
We're gonna get through this together.

14:31.650 --> 14:33.222
I've been observing you, Adrian.

14:33.637 --> 14:35.907
You're doing very well
in spite of your condition.

14:36.027 --> 14:38.064
- Your acute claustrophobia.
- Well...

14:38.527 --> 14:41.313
I'd even say you're
being rather heroic.

14:44.255 --> 14:46.597
I have to be brave for Natalie's sake.

14:46.717 --> 14:48.877
She's just a girl.
She's depending on me.

14:49.483 --> 14:52.588
- Well, she's lucky to have you.
- That's true.

14:54.950 --> 14:55.781
What?

14:56.248 --> 14:57.552
Medal of honor?

14:57.842 --> 15:00.731
I think that's a bit premature,
Dr. Bell.

15:00.950 --> 15:02.010
Who's Dr. Bell?

15:02.984 --> 15:04.581
His new therapist.

15:05.258 --> 15:06.792
It's a coping mechanism.

15:07.002 --> 15:08.223
Someone to lean on.

15:08.737 --> 15:09.721
Makes sense.

15:09.967 --> 15:10.780
It does?

15:10.900 --> 15:13.922
The important thing
is to stay busy.

15:14.053 --> 15:15.727
Focus on the case,

15:16.416 --> 15:18.584
all right?
Now, tell me about the crime scene.

15:18.704 --> 15:22.030
Okay, well,
the room was locked from the inside.

15:22.150 --> 15:24.565
Everybody's saying suicide, but

15:25.364 --> 15:27.665
it doesn't feel right.
You know?

15:28.591 --> 15:30.227
I found this.

15:34.051 --> 15:34.856
Here.

15:36.942 --> 15:38.208
Smells like gunpowder.

15:39.055 --> 15:42.062
I noticed that too.
Hey, we make a pretty good team.

15:48.708 --> 15:50.727
Mr. Monk,
they're patching you through.

15:52.637 --> 15:53.544
Thank you.

16:03.210 --> 16:05.440
- This is Disher.
<i>- Yeah, Randy, it's me.</i>

16:08.211 --> 16:09.323
I need you to...

16:10.203 --> 16:12.618
I need you to research
a possible murder victim.

16:12.838 --> 16:16.386
- Yeah, sure, what's the name?
- <i>Okay</i>, he's a Lieutenant Commander.

16:16.667 --> 16:19.690
Jason Pierce.
Talk to his family, see what they think.

16:19.810 --> 16:23.127
Maybe he kept a diary
or some sort of log.

16:23.247 --> 16:25.729
<i>Yeah</i>, I'll get right on it.
Where are you?

16:25.947 --> 16:28.726
I'm on a submarine.
The USS Seattle.

16:28.987 --> 16:30.420
Yeah, seriously.

16:30.540 --> 16:31.728
<i>We're underwater.</i>

16:32.512 --> 16:33.732
<i>Periscope depth.</i>

16:34.128 --> 16:36.980
<i>Water temp, 46 degrees.
Speed,</i> 50 knots.

16:37.108 --> 16:39.250
Relative bearing two-five-niner.

16:41.026 --> 16:42.323
You're on a submarine?

16:43.544 --> 16:44.556
How you doin'?

16:44.676 --> 16:48.214
Fine, I'm fine. I'd be going crazy
if Dr. Bell wasn't here.

16:49.748 --> 16:52.439
<i>Dr...</i> Dr. Bell's there?
How did he get on the submarine?

16:52.559 --> 16:55.948
<i>Well, </i> hold on.
I'll let him tell you. He's right here.

16:57.469 --> 16:58.427
It's Disher.

16:59.651 --> 17:01.325
Yeah, I work with him.

17:21.160 --> 17:22.156
I know, right?

17:23.728 --> 17:24.647
<i>Hey, Monk?</i>

17:27.800 --> 17:29.994
Can you believe it?
<i>That's a true story.</i>

17:30.114 --> 17:32.658
Yeah. Is there anyone else there
I can talk to?

17:34.511 --> 17:37.399
You can stay here. It's the only place
on board with any privacy.

17:37.519 --> 17:40.234
And believe me,
you're gonna want privacy.

17:40.354 --> 17:42.794
These guys haven't seen
a girl since we left port.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.228
- That was three hours ago.
- I know.

17:46.381 --> 17:47.512
Clean towel,

17:47.959 --> 17:50.470
soap, toothpaste...
Davenport, of course.

17:51.877 --> 17:53.129
You think I'm crazy?

17:54.905 --> 17:56.324
I mean, about my friend?

17:57.129 --> 18:00.500
I don't know, but you knocked on the
right door. Mr. Monk will figure it out.

18:01.583 --> 18:05.328
Nat, I'm sorry about
getting you stuck like this.

18:06.108 --> 18:07.846
You don't look like you're sorry.

18:08.312 --> 18:10.306
Well, I'm sorry i'm not more sorry.

18:13.228 --> 18:16.091
Do you ever wonder what would've
happened if you met me first?

18:16.298 --> 18:18.726
- I mean, before Mitch.
- I did meet you first.

18:18.858 --> 18:21.933
Austin, Texas, new years eve, 1989.

18:22.552 --> 18:24.709
- You were there?
- You were with your fiancee.

18:24.837 --> 18:25.665
Caroline?

18:25.910 --> 18:27.341
Caroline Shelton.

18:27.547 --> 18:28.940
So what happened to her?

18:30.235 --> 18:32.928
She sobered up.
Realized she could do better.

18:34.001 --> 18:35.190
You never married?

18:35.651 --> 18:37.524
A submarine's not a coed vessel.

18:37.644 --> 18:39.855
It's Kinda hard
to meet a woman on this job.

18:40.189 --> 18:42.527
Well,
it's coed now, isn't it?

18:44.392 --> 18:45.683
Yes, it is.

18:51.030 --> 18:54.292
- Permission to come aboard.
- You're already on board, mr. Monk.

18:54.412 --> 18:57.428
Right, I mean, permission to
come into your

18:58.164 --> 18:59.749
cabin-room-crib.

19:00.327 --> 19:01.515
Permission denied.

19:11.921 --> 19:13.068
It's me again.

19:13.670 --> 19:14.654
How about now?

19:15.634 --> 19:17.668
- Come in, Mr. Monk.
- Thank you.

19:24.738 --> 19:25.876
That's my father.

19:26.452 --> 19:29.385
- He was secretary of the Navy.
- He must've been very proud of you.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.647
You'd think he would have been,
wouldn't you?

19:34.943 --> 19:36.937
<i>"NON SIBI SED PATRIAE."</i>

19:37.245 --> 19:39.135
"Not self, but country."
I like it.

19:39.342 --> 19:41.138
You like it.
I live it.

19:42.369 --> 19:44.475
I thought I told you to stay
in the officers'ward.

19:44.595 --> 19:48.523
Yes, sir, I know, but my therapist
thought I should focus on the case.

19:48.868 --> 19:49.954
Your therapist?

19:52.983 --> 19:54.197
It doesn't matter.

19:55.539 --> 19:57.114
There is no case, detective.

19:57.299 --> 19:59.160
Lt. Commander pierce shot himself.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.416
It's in the NCIS report.

20:02.439 --> 20:04.164
There were two other witnesses.

20:06.020 --> 20:07.254
We heard a gunshot.

20:07.374 --> 20:10.275
The door was locked from the inside
and I had to break it down.

20:10.592 --> 20:12.905
So there's no other explanation,
is there?

20:14.564 --> 20:15.550
I don't know.

20:15.712 --> 20:18.115
Well, what you don't know
could fill a Super-Tanker.

20:18.235 --> 20:19.480
Did you know that Pierce

20:19.600 --> 20:22.133
was a recovering alcoholic
and had started drinking again?

20:22.260 --> 20:24.809
- Had he?
- He confided that in me two weeks ago.

20:25.205 --> 20:27.871
And that's why I was worried
when he didn't show up for the drill.

20:27.991 --> 20:29.154
About that drill.

20:29.478 --> 20:32.468
That was the second drill
of the day,

20:32.634 --> 20:36.047
is that right?
Is that normal, two drills in one day?

20:36.398 --> 20:37.198
No,

20:37.599 --> 20:40.641
it's quite unusual. My job...
My mandate...

20:40.833 --> 20:42.820
Is to prepare these children for battle.

20:43.935 --> 20:46.154
War is not Tidy...
Mr. Monk.

20:46.572 --> 20:49.319
War does not follow any
set schedule and neither do I.

20:51.244 --> 20:52.483
Is there anything else?

20:57.289 --> 20:59.616
You're with us until thursday, Mr. Monk.

21:00.137 --> 21:02.138
I'd like very much not to see you again.

21:03.562 --> 21:06.033
It's a rather small boat,
but with

21:06.153 --> 21:09.379
vigilance and patience I believe
we can manage to avoid each other.

21:09.499 --> 21:11.255
Yes, sir, i'll do my best.

21:27.688 --> 21:29.983
It looks like a match.
What do you think?

21:30.624 --> 21:32.209
Yep, I think you're right.

21:33.413 --> 21:34.487
Definitely.

21:35.745 --> 21:37.061
You've done it again.

21:38.180 --> 21:40.778
Does anyone else on board
drink this brand of soda?

21:40.906 --> 21:42.318
Only Commander Whitaker.

21:42.511 --> 21:44.901
Nobody else can touch it.
It's his private stash.

21:46.403 --> 21:47.937
I need to borrow your weapon.

21:49.304 --> 21:51.247
And, some surgical tape.

21:56.974 --> 21:58.086
It's not loaded.

21:58.843 --> 21:59.584
Okay.

22:15.951 --> 22:17.622
You'll see.
Be patient.

22:31.546 --> 22:32.415
A silencer.

22:32.557 --> 22:34.738
That would explain the
gunpowder and the duct tape.

22:34.858 --> 22:36.953
Who would use a silencer
to kill himself?

22:37.073 --> 22:39.734
Okay, Mr. Monk, what are you saying?
Are you. Commander Whitaker?

22:39.854 --> 22:41.627
What about the locked
door and the gunshot?

22:41.747 --> 22:44.320
I don't know how he did it.
I don't know why.

22:45.669 --> 22:46.878
But he's the guy.

23:12.737 --> 23:14.114
Where's your lady friend?

23:14.234 --> 23:15.154
She's...

23:15.411 --> 23:17.264
She's staying in the infirmary.

23:18.261 --> 23:20.863
Lt. Albright
has got her in his sights.

23:21.118 --> 23:22.734
The target has been acquired.

23:25.199 --> 23:26.106
"Target."

23:29.141 --> 23:31.237
- What are you doin'?
- I'm separating my food.

23:32.233 --> 23:33.588
Is there a name for that?

23:33.770 --> 23:36.466
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
He's the expert.

23:44.216 --> 23:46.052
- You're not hungry?
- No, I'm starving.

23:46.920 --> 23:50.243
So,
tell me about Commander Whitaker.

23:50.421 --> 23:52.640
Were he and
Lt. Commander Pierce close?

23:52.760 --> 23:54.758
You're on a sub, brother.
Everybody's close.

23:55.013 --> 23:57.888
Pierce and the CO. Went way back.
They were in the gulf together.

23:58.647 --> 24:00.002
Who ordered vegetarian?

24:01.051 --> 24:02.061
Right here.

24:04.587 --> 24:06.095
Somebody wanted vegetarian?

24:11.316 --> 24:13.412
Here,
you can have mine.

24:13.623 --> 24:15.041
I already separated it.

24:17.118 --> 24:19.307
What was that?
Did you feel that?

24:20.291 --> 24:21.326
Oh, my god.

24:21.688 --> 24:23.235
Oh, my god, we've been hit!

24:23.468 --> 24:24.652
We're goin'down!

24:24.861 --> 24:27.292
I mean, we're goin'down more!

24:27.412 --> 24:29.956
It's okay, brother.
It's just a little sea turbulence.

24:33.838 --> 24:35.683
Good thing he wasn't with us in january.

24:36.820 --> 24:39.376
- What happened in january?
- We hit a mountain.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.915
You hit a mountain?
You didn't see a mountain?

24:44.035 --> 24:46.627
- It was an undersea mountain.
- There was a mix-up on the bridge.

24:46.747 --> 24:49.336
- They were using some old nav charts.
- And you hit a mountain?

24:49.456 --> 24:51.879
It's nobody's fault.
There was a big inquest.

24:52.139 --> 24:54.216
CO. Testified.
Everybody was cleared.

24:54.464 --> 24:56.713
But you have a new chart now, right?

24:56.885 --> 24:58.699
- Yes, sir.
- We sure about that?

24:58.821 --> 25:01.029
- It has all the mountains?
- Yes, sir.

25:01.149 --> 25:03.808
Not just most of the mountains,
it has all the mountains?

25:04.029 --> 25:05.834
Wait, you know what?
I'm not sure.

25:07.275 --> 25:10.406
I'm kidding, sir. We have...
Yeah, we're gonna be fine.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.071
You shouldn't joke about...

25:13.540 --> 25:14.537
Mountains.

25:15.887 --> 25:16.858
It's not funny.

25:26.970 --> 25:29.221
I'll just be a second.
I left a book in here.

25:29.613 --> 25:30.682
Okay.

25:37.683 --> 25:40.252
- You talked to Julie?
- I did, thank you.

25:40.385 --> 25:42.842
She couldn't believe I was
calling from a nuclear submarine.

25:42.962 --> 25:44.742
She wants me to bring
her home a torpedo.

25:45.318 --> 25:47.209
I'll have them gift-wrap one for you.

25:49.285 --> 25:50.551
I thought it was here.

25:50.912 --> 25:52.803
- What's it called?
- The art of war.

25:53.451 --> 25:55.943
Best book on male-female
relationships I ever read.

25:56.748 --> 25:58.716
Maybe it's up here.

25:59.995 --> 26:00.813
Sorry.

26:02.234 --> 26:03.014
Any luck?

26:04.016 --> 26:05.064
Just a second.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.822
- That's too bad.
- What?

26:10.959 --> 26:11.892
I found it.

26:26.006 --> 26:27.645
I can't.
I'm sorry.

26:28.864 --> 26:31.332
Is it 'cause of Mitch?
'cause we were friends?

26:31.452 --> 26:34.353
God, I don't know.
I just keep picturing him.

26:37.009 --> 26:37.862
I'm sorry.

26:38.818 --> 26:40.211
Well, I understand.

26:41.008 --> 26:41.838
You do?

26:42.359 --> 26:43.854
Then explain it to me.

26:59.695 --> 27:01.382
This is you.
Sheets are clean.

27:02.867 --> 27:04.087
Does it fold out?

27:04.734 --> 27:05.885
Nope, that's it.

27:10.113 --> 27:11.340
Does it fold out?

27:12.578 --> 27:13.748
No,
that's it.

27:18.213 --> 27:19.403
Does it fold out?

27:20.116 --> 27:22.225
It's actually more
comfortable than it looks.

27:22.345 --> 27:23.839
It would almost have to be.

27:24.263 --> 27:26.411
What about my friend?
Do you have room for him?

27:27.480 --> 27:28.286
Right...

27:28.481 --> 27:29.376
Dr. Bell.

27:31.392 --> 27:33.965
- He can have Jonesy's rack.
- Where's Jonesy?

27:35.014 --> 27:36.365
Jonesy Broke his neck.

27:36.527 --> 27:39.393
- In january, when we hit the mountain.
- How's he doin'?

27:40.366 --> 27:41.381
We lost him.

27:41.509 --> 27:45.309
He, He died in Bethesda
hospital a week ago, tuesday.

27:46.910 --> 27:48.993
- Good night, Mr. Monk.
- Does it fold out?

27:49.474 --> 27:50.931
- That's it.
- Okay.

27:51.230 --> 27:51.994
It's...

27:52.825 --> 27:54.678
- Good night, Mr. Monk.
- Good night.

27:56.162 --> 27:59.050
- I'm just gonna fold it out.
- No, you're gonna wanna get in there.

28:06.995 --> 28:08.376
A week ago tuesday?

28:08.784 --> 28:11.097
That's the same day
Commander Pierce died.

28:11.935 --> 28:12.868
Right, doc?

28:16.169 --> 28:18.172
Monk, you might be
right about Lt. Pierce.

28:18.292 --> 28:21.473
Spoke to his family, sisters, parents.
They all say he <i> would never</i>

28:21.593 --> 28:23.577
<i>kill himself.
Devout catholic, for one thing.</i>

28:23.697 --> 28:26.448
- We still can't prove it.
- <i>Well</i>, maybe you can.

28:26.748 --> 28:27.995
They gave me his computer.

28:28.115 --> 28:31.149
He made an appointment with a criminal
attorney. Planning on meeting next week.

28:31.269 --> 28:32.749
- Really, why?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

28:32.869 --> 28:36.306
I called the guy and he wouldn't
talk to me. Attorney-client blah, blah.

28:37.379 --> 28:40.088
All right, well, thanks, Randy.
We'll let you know what happens.

28:41.033 --> 28:41.736
Bye.

28:43.632 --> 28:45.920
- What are those?
- Just some old nav charts.

28:56.649 --> 28:57.512
Empty.

29:00.950 --> 29:02.780
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

29:04.556 --> 29:05.829
I bet he is.

29:07.928 --> 29:09.265
I've just talked to nav-tech.

29:09.385 --> 29:11.465
They're gonna be throwing
decoys at us all week.

29:11.585 --> 29:14.444
- We better be ready for anything.
- Yes, sir, we'll do you proud.

29:15.656 --> 29:16.781
Detective Monk.

29:17.901 --> 29:20.511
What part of "confined to quarters"
don't you understand?

29:20.631 --> 29:23.432
I thought you'd like to know
how the investigation is going.

29:24.053 --> 29:25.663
I'm getting closer.

29:25.947 --> 29:26.791
Closer?

29:28.036 --> 29:29.736
- To what?
- To...

29:30.931 --> 29:32.056
To the truth.

29:32.416 --> 29:34.397
I have the "who."
I have the "why."

29:35.085 --> 29:36.503
All I need is "how."

29:43.761 --> 29:44.668
Come here.

29:47.893 --> 29:49.604
You have something to say to me?

29:50.243 --> 29:51.125
You did it.

29:52.057 --> 29:54.690
You killed lt.
Commander Pierce and I know why.

29:55.403 --> 29:57.297
It was the accident last january.

29:58.308 --> 30:00.692
<i>You hit a mountain.
I still can't believe it.</i>

30:00.812 --> 30:02.601
How do you hit a mountain?

30:02.861 --> 30:04.914
<i>But you knew it was
a career-ending mistake.</i>

30:05.034 --> 30:08.803
<i>You convinced lt. Commander Pierce
to help you cover it up.</i>

30:09.091 --> 30:11.078
<i>You switched charts</i>

30:11.198 --> 30:13.712
<i>so that you could tell everyone
that it wasn't your fault.</i>

30:13.832 --> 30:16.311
<i>That you'd been given
a chart that was out of date.</i>

30:17.598 --> 30:18.811
<i>But one sailor...</i>

30:19.273 --> 30:21.572
A kid named Jonesy had been badly hurt.

30:21.868 --> 30:25.216
And when Jonesy died, lt.
Commander Pierce had a change of heart.

30:25.569 --> 30:27.877
And he told you he wanted to confess.

30:27.997 --> 30:28.725
So...

30:29.783 --> 30:30.809
I killed him

30:31.572 --> 30:34.055
to protect my reputation,
to save my career,

30:34.175 --> 30:36.151
so I wouldn't disappoint dead daddy?

30:36.470 --> 30:37.799
Is that your story?

30:38.270 --> 30:39.476
Something like that.

30:39.596 --> 30:42.322
What about the gunshot
from inside the room?

30:42.442 --> 30:44.679
There were three witnesses,
can you explain that?

30:44.799 --> 30:45.655
Not yet.

30:45.919 --> 30:48.713
Lt. Commander Pierce's death
was a suicide.

30:48.841 --> 30:50.306
I'll tell you how I know.

30:50.426 --> 30:52.323
Because I said it was!

30:53.402 --> 30:57.402
When I'm on land, i'm a decorated
Commander in the United States Navy.

30:57.612 --> 31:01.420
When I'm on this ship,
I am the lord thy god!

31:01.912 --> 31:03.599
I am Jehovah!

31:04.648 --> 31:06.169
Do you understand?

31:06.833 --> 31:08.941
No one
questions me!

31:09.675 --> 31:11.188
Now, I've asked around.

31:11.956 --> 31:13.962
I know all about your problems.

31:14.485 --> 31:17.169
Your fears, your claustrophobia.

31:17.798 --> 31:20.043
You are having a breakdown, sir.

31:20.958 --> 31:23.458
It happens on submarines all the time

31:23.680 --> 31:25.188
to men far better than you.

31:25.723 --> 31:26.452
You...

31:28.244 --> 31:29.266
Are delusional.

31:30.959 --> 31:33.183
I have my share of problems.
I don't deny it.

31:33.421 --> 31:35.342
But when it comes to this case,

31:36.118 --> 31:39.096
the last thing I am
is delusional.

31:40.970 --> 31:41.826
Tell him.

31:47.495 --> 31:49.118
Does that sound delusional to you?

31:58.663 --> 31:59.762
Watch your step.

32:03.166 --> 32:04.534
Just talked to the commander.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.313
He's definitely the guy.

32:06.970 --> 32:09.777
Practically confessed.
Went on and on and on how he's

32:09.905 --> 32:12.589
god on this ship
and Adrian must be delusional.

32:14.080 --> 32:16.422
The answer must be
in Lt. Pierce's cabin.

32:16.542 --> 32:18.871
We've got to get back
in there and look around.

32:19.643 --> 32:20.780
Let's move out.

32:21.697 --> 32:22.656
What's this?

32:36.837 --> 32:38.867
This is it.
33.

32:44.872 --> 32:46.814
Sorry, it says "come alone."

32:49.937 --> 32:51.113
- Hello?
- Steve?

32:51.240 --> 32:52.007
Steve?

33:00.434 --> 33:01.425
Hello?

33:03.501 --> 33:04.728
Something's wrong.

33:08.944 --> 33:11.717
Let's shake some things up today.
Chief of boat,

33:11.919 --> 33:13.975
make your depth one-five-zero feet.

33:14.095 --> 33:16.049
Slow to all ahead two-thirds.

33:16.169 --> 33:17.447
Aye, aye, skipper.

33:17.626 --> 33:19.727
Depth one-five-zero feet.

33:19.855 --> 33:20.762
Standby.

33:31.540 --> 33:32.588
We're diving!

33:32.731 --> 33:34.737
Natalie, we have other
things to worry about!

33:34.865 --> 33:37.317
Well, Mr.
Monk, we must be in the ballast tank.

33:37.437 --> 33:38.988
My god, it's the ocean!

33:39.154 --> 33:40.721
Natalie, it's the ocean!

33:40.841 --> 33:42.835
It's the pacific ocean!

33:43.880 --> 33:44.749
Wait.

33:45.309 --> 33:47.927
Dr. Bell,
he's right outside.

33:48.047 --> 33:49.887
Dr. Bell, open the hatch!

33:50.012 --> 33:51.460
- Dr. Bell!
- Dr. Bell!

33:51.580 --> 33:54.520
- What my saving, Help, somebody, help!
- Dr. Bell!

34:00.563 --> 34:02.658
<i>Dr. Bell, open the hatch!</i>

34:02.792 --> 34:04.417
<i>Help, somebody, help!</i>

34:04.538 --> 34:06.165
<i>- Open the hatch!
- Help!</i>

34:06.293 --> 34:07.222
Dr. Bell!

34:07.342 --> 34:09.770
Somebody help!
We're in here!

34:09.889 --> 34:11.717
Ocean in my shoes.

34:12.288 --> 34:15.879
Ocean... Ocean in my shoes, dr. Bell!

34:16.312 --> 34:17.181
Mr. Monk!

34:17.478 --> 34:19.404
It won't do us any
good if we both panic.

34:19.524 --> 34:20.904
You're right, you're right.

34:21.927 --> 34:23.974
We'll take turns.
I'll go first.

34:24.726 --> 34:27.341
- God! Natalie!
- What?

34:28.303 --> 34:30.206
Ocean in my pants.

34:30.757 --> 34:32.661
Ocean in my pants.

34:32.924 --> 34:35.454
Make your depth three-zero-zero feet.

34:35.659 --> 34:37.538
Three-zero-zero feet, aye.

34:40.391 --> 34:41.426
Natalie...

34:42.007 --> 34:43.809
I don't know how to swim!

34:44.347 --> 34:46.418
I took some lessons once, but...

34:46.998 --> 34:48.998
Not actually in water.

34:49.286 --> 34:52.585
Mr. Monk, I don't think
swimming's gonna be a problem.

34:52.705 --> 34:55.210
I'm not even sure I know how to drown.

35:04.649 --> 35:06.255
Have you seen Mr. Monk and ms. Teeger?

35:06.375 --> 35:08.908
Yes, sir, about 20 minutes ago
I saw 'em on level B near the stern.

35:09.051 --> 35:10.213
Level B?

35:10.666 --> 35:13.023
Helm steer zero-nine-five.

35:13.151 --> 35:14.518
We're at 400 feet.

35:14.638 --> 35:18.082
Leveling off.
Who ordered you to level off?

35:18.202 --> 35:19.514
Keep diving.

35:37.509 --> 35:38.326
Wait.

35:39.969 --> 35:42.507
- My belt. My good luck belt.
- Yeah.

35:42.627 --> 35:44.110
How's that workin'out for you?

35:53.192 --> 35:54.342
Can you help me?

35:55.985 --> 35:57.984
Get the beads out.
Get the beads out.

35:59.498 --> 36:02.220
It's hollow. We can make it like
a snorkel. It'll buy us some time.

36:02.548 --> 36:03.333
Okay.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.255
- It works, try it!
- I'm fine.

36:10.375 --> 36:13.403
- Why, because of germs? Not now!
- I'm fine.-

36:14.157 --> 36:15.059
I'm fine.

36:19.865 --> 36:20.836
Stand back!

36:34.366 --> 36:37.254
Gotta surface... Surface now!
There's two people in the ballast tank.

36:38.450 --> 36:40.469
That's ridiculous.
Why would they be in there?

36:40.999 --> 36:42.060
You tell me.

36:51.922 --> 36:53.946
- Surface.
- We're surfacing.

36:55.127 --> 36:57.666
Surfacing.
Stand by for emergency ascent.

37:32.848 --> 37:34.835
Detective Monk,
ms. Teeger.

37:34.978 --> 37:37.713
- I'm glad to see you both in one piece.
- Are you?

37:37.833 --> 37:40.075
It's all over, Commander.
We solved the case.

37:40.306 --> 37:42.470
I'm gonna let dr. Bell explain...

37:42.590 --> 37:44.217
- You do it.
- He's sleepy.

37:44.342 --> 37:47.125
- It's better if you do it. Good at it.
- Okay, fine, I'll do it. I'll do it.

37:48.540 --> 37:50.532
We have all the pieces.
The "who,"

37:50.968 --> 37:52.757
the "why,"
and the "how."

37:53.035 --> 37:54.835
- Is that right?
- This is the how.

37:55.806 --> 37:59.171
It's a firecracker.
And these ashes are from a cigarette.

37:59.335 --> 38:00.973
Found them in the vent behind the door.

38:01.093 --> 38:04.930
It happened right here in this room
a few minutes before the second drill.

38:06.640 --> 38:09.604
<i>You forced Jason Pierce
to drink some vodka...</i>

38:11.444 --> 38:12.939
<i>Then you shot him.</i>

38:13.192 --> 38:15.710
<i>You executed your
friend in cold blood...</i>

38:15.830 --> 38:17.619
<i>With a homemade silencer.</i>

38:18.546 --> 38:19.990
<i>Nobody heard a thing.</i>

38:23.415 --> 38:25.464
<i>You used a cigarette as a fuse,</i>

38:25.920 --> 38:28.911
<i>which gave you about five minutes
to get back to the bridge.</i>

38:31.368 --> 38:33.284
<i>You hid it inside that vent,</i>

38:33.416 --> 38:36.174
<i>you figured it was the one
place they wouldn't look.</i>

38:37.311 --> 38:39.196
<i>It was a perfect alibi.</i>

38:40.164 --> 38:42.037
<i>You were in the hallway with witnesses</i>

38:42.157 --> 38:44.766
When they heard,
what they thought was a gunshot.

38:45.719 --> 38:49.380
<i>All you had to do was slip the key
into his pocket when no one was looking.</i>

38:49.500 --> 38:51.756
We found a thumbprint
on the inside of that vent.

38:51.876 --> 38:54.739
I could fax it to NCIS. I asked,
it would take about a half an hour.

38:55.027 --> 38:56.688
That won't be necessary, Lieutenant.

38:56.994 --> 38:58.056
In that case, sir,

38:58.477 --> 39:01.416
I'm relieving you of your command
and confing you to quarters.

39:04.527 --> 39:06.520
Congratulations, detective Monk.

39:07.008 --> 39:10.803
I hope the rest of the Navy
does its job as well as you do yours.

39:23.142 --> 39:23.998
Shall we?

39:26.930 --> 39:28.374
I'm sorry, after you.

39:32.881 --> 39:35.387
They're debriefing me tomorrow.
Then I ship out again.

39:35.912 --> 39:37.842
- For how long?
- December.

39:39.217 --> 39:43.064
Well... Home for christmas, come on by.
I'll make you some cocoa.

39:43.851 --> 39:46.019
- With those little marshmallows?
- Marshmallows?

39:46.139 --> 39:48.963
That's a big step, Lieutenant.
You sure we're ready for that?

39:49.787 --> 39:50.981
Well, we'll find out.

39:53.647 --> 39:57.257
Adrian, i'm so proud of you.
I'm... I'm just bursting.

39:57.397 --> 39:59.287
I mean, you came through like a champ.

39:59.407 --> 40:01.899
And under the worst
possible circumstances.

40:02.659 --> 40:06.073
I couldn't have done it without you.
I'll see you around, doc.

40:08.497 --> 40:10.555
- You really were on a submarine.
- Yeah.

40:11.694 --> 40:13.346
- How was that?
- It was...

40:13.629 --> 40:16.583
Was Kinda horrifying.
I was scared to death every minute.

40:17.909 --> 40:19.740
- Same old, same old?
- Pretty much.

40:19.860 --> 40:21.407
I'm gonna go check out the sub.

40:23.155 --> 40:23.973
Adrian.

40:28.059 --> 40:31.305
- How did you do that?
- Lieutenant told me what happened.

40:31.798 --> 40:35.308
A submarine. I can hardly wait
to hear the whole story.

40:35.428 --> 40:37.312
I thought we might drive back together.

40:37.882 --> 40:39.379
But you were there.

40:40.417 --> 40:43.036
Yes...
Yes, it's true. I was there.

40:43.524 --> 40:45.862
But you could remind
me of some of the details.

40:47.154 --> 40:48.503
But it just happened.

40:49.153 --> 40:51.103
Now it's like a blur to you?

40:51.279 --> 40:54.526
- Just a little hazy, but...
- Wow, it's funny how the mind works.

40:54.646 --> 40:57.995
- Yes it is. Let's get to the car.
- You found a parking spot?
