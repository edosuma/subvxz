and the doctors handed her
to grandma.

33:57.196 --> 33:59.314
And grandma was like,
"she keeps fighting me.

33:59.398 --> 34:02.000
She's tough and stubborn,
just like Bob."

34:02.068 --> 34:05.270
And so they named her
Haley Bob.

34:05.338 --> 34:07.973
Mom was named
after a cat.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.958
After a beautiful, tough,
old tabby cat.

34:11.043 --> 34:12.610
That's awesome.

34:12.661 --> 34:14.612
But mom's
not that tough.

34:14.664 --> 34:17.415
Ooh. Gonna have to disagree
with you on that one, buddy.

34:17.466 --> 34:19.217
Yeah.
Your mom's really tough.

34:19.284 --> 34:21.719
Do you know her and Aunt Taylor
used to totally go at it?

34:21.786 --> 34:22.887
Really? Like how?

34:24.590 --> 34:26.391
It's not funny, Taylor.
Ow!

34:26.458 --> 34:29.226
Let go!

34:29.295 --> 34:30.795
Whoa.

34:30.862 --> 34:32.013
Yeah.
That's not all.

34:32.098 --> 34:33.815
Remember when Chuck
was bullying you?

34:36.319 --> 34:38.103
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second?

34:38.154 --> 34:39.971
I'm Haley Scott.
I'm Jamie's mom.

34:40.022 --> 34:41.438
Uh-huh.

34:41.489 --> 34:43.775
Jamie came home from school
upset the other day.

34:43.826 --> 34:45.577
I guess your son
was teasing him.

34:45.643 --> 34:47.829
Jamie?
Is he the one with the cape?

34:47.913 --> 34:49.331
Wow.

34:49.415 --> 34:52.117
5 is a little old for a cape,
don't you think?

34:52.168 --> 34:56.036
Maybe you should do him a favor,
take it away from him,

34:56.121 --> 34:57.756
and then he won't get teased
anymore --

34:57.823 --> 34:59.591
about the cape, anyway.

34:59.658 --> 35:01.993
Listen, honey,
if your little brat

35:02.044 --> 35:03.345
doesn't stop picking on
my son,

35:03.429 --> 35:05.496
not only will I give Jamie
permission to kick his ass,

35:05.548 --> 35:07.599
but I'll be kicking your ass
right alongside of him.

35:07.666 --> 35:11.136
Got that, bitch?
I'd like to see you try, little girl.

35:11.187 --> 35:13.054
Aah!

35:13.139 --> 35:16.007
Man.
Mom's kind of crazy.

35:16.075 --> 35:18.342
Yeah. I haven't even told you
about the slapping.

35:18.394 --> 35:19.811
There's slapping?

35:19.862 --> 35:22.063
Oh, there's slapping.
Hey, Brooke.

35:22.131 --> 35:23.782
Name a few people
that Haley's slapped.

35:23.849 --> 35:25.349
Jamie wants to warn
Lydia.

35:25.401 --> 35:29.788
Oh.
Well, there's Rachel...

35:31.907 --> 35:33.792
♪ I'm your kind of girl ♪

35:33.859 --> 35:35.326
...Renee...

35:39.665 --> 35:43.868
Ooh.
And Nanny Carrie.

35:44.703 --> 35:47.205
You get the hell out of my house
right now!

35:48.808 --> 35:52.811
Yeah. And in mom's defense,
nanny Carrie had that coming.

35:52.878 --> 35:53.762
Oh, yeah.

35:53.846 --> 35:55.814
Now that I think about it,

35:55.881 --> 35:57.982
you don't want to mess
with mom.

35:58.050 --> 36:00.685
Hey, Clay,
did mom ever attack you?

36:00.736 --> 36:04.222
Yeah.
But it was with her words.

36:04.273 --> 36:06.691
You know full well this lying
whore didn't sleep with Nathan,

36:06.742 --> 36:08.610
and you want to pay her
$200,000?

36:08.694 --> 36:10.412
Whoa.
I don't want to.

36:10.496 --> 36:12.197
I simply suggested
that it was an option.

36:12.248 --> 36:14.115
It's not an option, Clay.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.617
And while we're
suggesting things,

36:15.701 --> 36:17.502
let me suggest
that you are a huge reason

36:17.569 --> 36:19.637
why this is happening right now.
Okay.

36:19.705 --> 36:21.122
You love it --
the parties, the women.

36:21.207 --> 36:22.740
And you love having Nathan
alongside you

36:22.792 --> 36:23.758
more than anything else.

36:23.843 --> 36:24.909
That's not fair.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.428
No?
The picture?

36:26.512 --> 36:29.264
The one of that woman
draped all over my husband.

36:29.348 --> 36:31.382
What party was that at,
Clay?

36:31.434 --> 36:33.218
Who threw that party?

36:33.269 --> 36:35.186
I'm not saying
you don't love him

36:35.254 --> 36:36.688
because I know you do.

36:36.755 --> 36:39.641
But you love having him at your
side more than anything else.

36:39.708 --> 36:42.277
You could have protected him
from this.

36:42.361 --> 36:44.279
How, Haley?
He's a grown man.

36:44.363 --> 36:46.114
So are you.

36:46.198 --> 36:48.933
Start acting like it.

36:48.984 --> 36:50.768
Ooh.

36:50.820 --> 36:52.770
Yeah, you may --
you ought to tell Lydia

36:52.822 --> 36:56.124
just to never suggest
optional compromises.

36:56.192 --> 36:57.408
You should write that down.

37:02.798 --> 37:04.249
That's it, Chloe.
You're doing great.

37:04.300 --> 37:06.468
Now I need you to push, okay?
Here we go.

37:06.552 --> 37:07.886
And push.

37:07.953 --> 37:09.620
Push, Chloe.
Come on.

37:09.672 --> 37:11.289
Push.

37:11.340 --> 37:12.290
That's it.

37:12.341 --> 37:13.341
You're doing great, Chloe.

37:13.425 --> 37:14.342
Five counts.

37:19.899 --> 37:21.465
Good job, Chloe.
You're doing great,

37:21.517 --> 37:23.234
and again.

37:23.302 --> 37:25.019
Push, Chloe, push.

37:25.104 --> 37:26.454
Come on.

37:29.024 --> 37:31.142
Hey, it's you.

37:31.193 --> 37:34.145
Oh. Hey.

37:34.196 --> 37:35.947
Brooke, this is...

37:35.998 --> 37:37.682
Eric. Hi.

37:37.750 --> 37:39.284
Hi.

37:39.335 --> 37:40.869
What are you
doing here?

37:40.953 --> 37:43.004
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

37:43.088 --> 37:45.623
That's
my girlfriend, Chloe.

37:48.010 --> 37:50.494
