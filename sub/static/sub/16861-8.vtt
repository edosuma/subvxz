00:02.400 --> 00:03.617
<i>Previously on rescue me...</i>

00:03.652 --> 00:04.799
I was out with your sister

00:04.834 --> 00:06.334
Last night. Turns out she really

00:06.369 --> 00:07.834
Likes it when I get into fights.

00:07.869 --> 00:08.867
Maggie, what do you want?

00:08.902 --> 00:09.734
I want you to be

00:09.769 --> 00:10.532
My boyfriend.

00:10.567 --> 00:11.399
You want to be with me

00:11.434 --> 00:12.467
Because, what, I punched some

00:12.502 --> 00:13.367
Guy in the face?

00:13.402 --> 00:14.165
Yes.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.065
I got to work.

00:15.100 --> 00:15.901
They couldn't get someone

00:15.936 --> 00:16.699
Else to cover?

00:16.734 --> 00:17.617
They all got seniority.

00:17.652 --> 00:18.500
You gotta get out of

00:18.535 --> 00:19.499
That house.

00:19.534 --> 00:20.301
Just wondering if I can

00:20.336 --> 00:21.218
Maybe just crash here for

00:21.253 --> 00:22.176
A little while, you know?

00:22.211 --> 00:23.139
You take the master bedroom.

00:23.174 --> 00:25.037
I haven't been able to sleep in

00:25.072 --> 00:27.303
There since she left anyway.

00:27.338 --> 00:29.469
Grope, ass grab, tit rub.

00:29.504 --> 00:31.601
There's no way shirley got

00:31.636 --> 00:32.665
Ahold of her.

00:32.701 --> 00:33.567
Well, who else would give

00:33.602 --> 00:34.601
A shit?

00:39.300 --> 00:40.317
Roofies and viagra.

00:40.352 --> 00:41.299
What are roofies?

00:41.334 --> 00:42.701
It's the date rape drug.

00:42.736 --> 00:44.400
Thanks.

What the hell happened?

00:59.369 --> 01:01.567
Look familiar?

01:04.900 --> 01:06.167
Could be survivor's guilt.

01:06.202 --> 01:07.434
That's the one. That's it.

01:07.469 --> 01:08.818
That's definitely it.

01:08.853 --> 01:10.160
Who's the chick?

01:10.195 --> 01:11.467
Her name's Paula.

01:11.502 --> 01:12.332
She's sweet.

01:12.367 --> 01:13.283
Yeah, you bangin' her?

01:13.318 --> 01:14.426
You screw around behind

01:14.461 --> 01:15.380
My back, we're through.

01:15.415 --> 01:16.241
Why don't you pay him

01:16.276 --> 01:17.033
When you get home.

01:17.068 --> 01:17.968
These guys friends of yours?

01:18.003 --> 01:18.701
Yeah. They work at my

01:18.736 --> 01:19.499
Firehouse.

01:19.534 --> 01:20.717
They just lost you your job.

01:20.752 --> 01:21.901
Get your fat ass out of here.

01:21.936 --> 01:22.785
Oh, no.

01:22.820 --> 01:23.599
What?

01:23.634 --> 01:24.700
My ex. I can't believe it.

01:24.735 --> 01:25.984
This guy won't let it go.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.233
All right. I didn't plan for

01:27.268 --> 01:28.332
This right now.

01:28.367 --> 01:29.434
Tommy, I'm telling you,

01:29.469 --> 01:30.365
Sebastian's crazy.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.799
His name is sebastian?

01:31.834 --> 01:34.034
I'm your dirty, little whore.

01:34.069 --> 01:35.632
Yeah, daddy!

01:35.667 --> 01:36.434
You know why she's marrying

01:36.469 --> 01:37.632
You, right?

01:37.667 --> 01:38.465
Because I'm a big, strong,

01:38.500 --> 01:39.883
Attractive almost thin guy who's

01:39.918 --> 01:41.267
Not afraid to express himself

01:41.302 --> 01:42.499
Justice wise.

01:42.534 --> 01:43.717
No, because you're trapped

01:43.752 --> 01:44.866
In here, and she knows

01:44.901 --> 01:46.133
You're not gonna cheat on her.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.232
Shit.

01:49.267 --> 01:50.065
That's gotta be tough,

01:50.100 --> 01:51.683
Huh, Tommy? Knowing I'm bangin'

01:51.718 --> 01:53.267
Your ex. Knowing you're never

01:53.302 --> 01:54.334
Gonna get mine.

01:54.369 --> 01:56.018
Tommy...

01:56.053 --> 01:57.632
yeah?

01:57.667 --> 01:58.601
I always knew that you'd be

01:58.636 --> 01:59.866
Good at that.

01:59.901 --> 02:00.951
Forget about her. Forget

02:00.986 --> 02:01.966
About the whole thing.

02:02.001 --> 02:03.367
Right now, all that matters

02:03.402 --> 02:07.133
Is us. All right?

02:07.168 --> 02:08.400
Right.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.332
Wow.

02:12.367 --> 02:14.432
You got a light? You know,

02:14.467 --> 02:16.050
Somebody should invent a lighter

02:16.085 --> 02:18.192
That you can hang around your

02:18.227 --> 02:20.300
Neck, or you can stick somewhere

02:20.335 --> 02:21.098
So you...

02:21.133 --> 02:23.332
boo!

02:23.367 --> 02:24.500
Jesus Christ, stack.

02:24.535 --> 02:25.634
Hey, laurel and hardy.

02:25.669 --> 02:26.701
Got a light?

02:26.736 --> 02:27.899
Yeah.

02:27.934 --> 02:28.934
Who's your little friend?

02:28.969 --> 02:30.232
This is blackjack.

02:30.267 --> 02:31.817
Oh, yeah. Great nickname.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.367
So, what up, white people?

02:33.402 --> 02:34.165
How are you?

02:34.200 --> 02:35.001
This is one of our new

02:35.036 --> 02:35.866
Urban recruits.

02:35.901 --> 02:36.767
What did that take, about

02:36.802 --> 02:37.634
10 seconds to come up with?

02:37.669 --> 02:38.399
5, actually.

02:38.434 --> 02:39.300
Hey, how's the family?

02:39.335 --> 02:40.132
They're fine. You know,

02:40.167 --> 02:40.901
Mickey and cullen are off to

02:40.936 --> 02:41.966
College. Stacy's taking

02:42.001 --> 02:44.267
Ballet lessons. Terry wants to

02:44.302 --> 02:45.168
Be the next donald trump.

02:45.203 --> 02:46.034
Marty's trying to save

02:46.069 --> 02:46.933
The world. They

02:46.968 --> 02:47.984
Fight like cats and dogs.

02:48.019 --> 02:48.910
Tip's cute as a button.

02:48.945 --> 02:49.801
Ov to 73.

02:49.836 --> 02:50.632
7-3 go.

02:50.667 --> 02:51.534
You got heavy fumes

02:51.569 --> 02:52.432
In the basement.

02:52.467 --> 02:54.968
10-4. Oh, hey, burger after

02:55.003 --> 02:55.785
The job?

02:55.820 --> 02:56.532
Sure.

02:56.567 --> 02:57.300
Hey, stack, what are you

02:57.335 --> 02:58.651
Weighing now?

02:58.686 --> 02:59.933
Uh... 230.

02:59.968 --> 03:01.501
You know what, 230 my ass.

03:01.536 --> 03:02.985
I'm telling you. The guy's

03:03.020 --> 03:04.193
Built like a goddamn horse.

03:04.228 --> 03:05.367
Yeah. That would make Jack

03:05.402 --> 03:06.432
The jockey, right?

03:06.467 --> 03:07.983
Yeah. Blackjack. Great name.

03:08.018 --> 03:09.500
Hey, how many black jockeys

03:09.535 --> 03:10.132
Do you know?

03:10.167 --> 03:11.017
I don't even know that many

03:11.052 --> 03:12.209
Black people. I mean, probably

03:12.244 --> 03:13.355
A total of 5. Two of those are

03:13.390 --> 03:14.467
Reggie Jackson and barry bonds,

03:14.502 --> 03:15.601
Who I hate, by the way.

03:15.636 --> 03:16.367
Yeah.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.167
Mayday, mayday. We got a

03:23.202 --> 03:24.451
Gas explosion. There's guys

03:24.486 --> 03:25.701
Trapped in the basement.

03:31.068 --> 03:31.734
Let's go.

03:39.334 --> 03:40.434
What have you got?

03:40.469 --> 03:41.499
Jesus Christ.

03:41.534 --> 03:42.567
I got a rope here.

03:42.602 --> 03:43.299
What?

03:43.334 --> 03:44.098
I got a rope.

03:44.133 --> 03:45.133
Well, follow it down.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.133
Go to stack. Go to stack

03:51.168 --> 03:52.100
To the right.

03:55.867 --> 03:57.132
Probie!

03:57.167 --> 03:57.999
Franco, what's going on?

03:58.034 --> 03:59.083
73 is stuck in there. Probie

03:59.118 --> 04:00.059
Went in after him, there was

04:00.094 --> 04:01.001
A huge collapse. This thing's

04:01.036 --> 04:01.766
Blocked solid.

04:01.801 --> 04:02.901
All right 62 to camp, 62

04:02.936 --> 04:04.001
To camp. Are you there?

04:04.036 --> 04:04.966
Mikey?

04:05.001 --> 04:05.899
No, damn it.

04:05.934 --> 04:06.901
It's got to be another way

04:06.936 --> 04:07.732
In there.

04:07.767 --> 04:08.650
Yeah, yeah, Tommy. It could

04:08.685 --> 04:09.534
Be down the hall to the left.

04:09.569 --> 04:10.500
All right.

04:14.601 --> 04:16.733
Stack! Stack! Stay with me.

04:21.733 --> 04:22.767
What have we got here?

04:27.567 --> 04:28.500
I'm gonna get you out. Just

04:28.535 --> 04:30.367
Stay with me, OK?

05:58.901 --> 06:00.351
* on another day,

06:00.386 --> 06:01.766
Come on, come on,

06:01.801 --> 06:03.167
With these ropes I tied,

06:03.202 --> 06:04.968
Can we do no wrong?

06:05.003 --> 06:06.432
Now we grieve

06:06.467 --> 06:08.067
'Cause now is gone,

06:08.102 --> 06:09.751
Things were good

06:09.786 --> 06:11.365
When we were young,

06:11.400 --> 06:12.767
With my teeth locked down

06:12.802 --> 06:14.301
I can see the blood

06:14.336 --> 06:15.766
Of a thousand men

06:15.801 --> 06:17.667
Who have come and gone,

06:17.702 --> 06:19.265
Now we grieve

06:19.300 --> 06:20.917
'Cause now is gone,

06:20.952 --> 06:22.626
Things were good

06:22.661 --> 06:24.247
When we were young,

06:24.282 --> 06:25.858
Is it safe to say?

06:25.893 --> 06:27.399
Come on, come on,

06:27.434 --> 06:28.901
Was it right to leave?

06:28.936 --> 06:30.601
Come on, come on,

06:30.636 --> 06:32.318
Will I ever learn?

06:32.353 --> 06:33.993
Come on, come on,

06:34.028 --> 06:36.048
Come on, come on,

06:36.083 --> 06:38.068
Come on, come on *

06:45.034 --> 06:46.165
Oh, hello.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.567
Hey. How you doing?

06:47.602 --> 06:48.933
Good.

06:48.968 --> 06:52.499
Can I come in?

06:52.534 --> 06:54.601
Um, it's so pretty outside.

06:54.636 --> 06:56.634
Let's stay outside.

07:00.834 --> 07:02.133
You haven't, uh, returned

07:02.168 --> 07:03.265
My calls.

07:03.300 --> 07:05.634
Yeah, I've been super busy.

07:05.669 --> 07:07.899
OK, I, um...

07:07.934 --> 07:10.334
just wanted to apologize for

07:10.369 --> 07:11.866
The other night.

07:11.901 --> 07:14.968
Um... I really don't remember

07:15.003 --> 07:16.332
Most of it.

07:16.367 --> 07:18.383
You don't remember anything?

07:18.418 --> 07:20.400
I remember having dinner.

07:20.435 --> 07:23.332
And then...

07:23.367 --> 07:25.450
yeah, you went ballistic.

07:25.485 --> 07:27.499
I kind of... figured.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.500
Um, when did I start drinking?

07:29.535 --> 07:30.567
Right after you started

07:30.602 --> 07:31.799
Crying.

07:31.834 --> 07:33.033
What was I crying about?

07:33.068 --> 07:34.701
You were crying like a baby

07:34.736 --> 07:36.035
About Janet and Johnny, you

07:36.070 --> 07:37.334
Were getting all pissed off.

07:37.369 --> 07:38.251
And then you went to

07:38.286 --> 07:39.393
The freezer, and grabbed

07:39.428 --> 07:40.497
Maggie's bottle of vodka.

07:40.532 --> 07:41.449
Why didn't you stop me?

07:41.484 --> 07:42.332
Because then you grabbed

07:42.367 --> 07:43.233
A baseball bat, and I thought

07:43.268 --> 07:44.100
You were gonna bash my brains

07:44.135 --> 07:45.167
In, so I left.

07:49.767 --> 07:52.532
Sorry, I...

07:52.567 --> 07:53.968
mick, I talked to mick about it.

07:54.003 --> 07:56.432
He's, uh, you know...

07:56.467 --> 07:58.217
it's fairly common. You know,

07:58.252 --> 07:59.968
I slipped, and then, hopefully,

08:00.003 --> 08:02.734
It won't happen again.

08:02.769 --> 08:03.867
OK.

08:06.901 --> 08:07.734
I don't know what you want

08:07.769 --> 08:09.165
From me here, so...

08:09.200 --> 08:10.850
l... I guess I thought maybe

08:10.885 --> 08:12.500
You'd have some sort of, I don't

08:12.535 --> 08:15.218
Know, some kind of insight

08:15.253 --> 08:17.543
Into why I did what I did.

08:17.578 --> 08:19.823
Because you feel guilty

08:19.858 --> 08:21.463
And you're in denial, you

08:21.498 --> 08:22.882
Repress your feelings, and

08:22.917 --> 08:24.267
You're a raging alcoholic?

08:26.534 --> 08:29.117
But I'm funny.

08:29.152 --> 08:31.666
You'd be right.

08:31.701 --> 08:34.100
All right, well, I just...

08:34.135 --> 08:37.116
wanted to say I was sorry,

08:37.152 --> 08:40.100
And, um, anyways, all right?

08:40.135 --> 08:41.866
OK. Apology accepted.

08:41.902 --> 08:44.198
OK.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.100
See ya.

08:45.135 --> 08:45.968
See ya.

08:47.601 --> 08:48.567
By the way...

08:48.602 --> 08:49.532
huh?

08:49.567 --> 08:51.667
Your ass looks great in

08:51.702 --> 08:52.867
Those pants.

08:59.834 --> 09:00.650
You better watch your back

09:00.685 --> 09:01.643
Tonight, shithead, you might

09:01.678 --> 09:02.601
Get a dose of your own medicine.

09:02.636 --> 09:03.299
Oh, really?

09:03.334 --> 09:04.200
Yeah. You sucker punched me,

09:04.235 --> 09:05.034
You douche bag.

09:05.069 --> 09:05.799
You saw it coming.

09:05.834 --> 09:06.734
Yeah, just keep your head

09:06.769 --> 09:07.634
Up, dick breath, all right?

09:07.669 --> 09:09.968
All right. Whatever.

09:10.003 --> 09:12.267
Come on, kick some ass,

09:12.302 --> 09:13.832
Let's go!

09:13.867 --> 09:15.034
You skate like a bitch,

09:15.069 --> 09:16.632
Number 18.

09:16.667 --> 09:17.500
Sweetie, the game hasn't

09:17.535 --> 09:18.365
Even started yet.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.165
Well, what do you think I

09:19.200 --> 09:21.467
Am, stupid? Come on. Eat shit,

09:21.502 --> 09:23.132
Number 44.

09:23.167 --> 09:24.767
She loves hockey.

09:28.434 --> 09:29.367
Can you make a singapore

09:29.402 --> 09:30.098
Sling?

09:30.133 --> 09:32.133
Oh, um, no hard alcohol.

09:32.168 --> 09:34.118
Just beer, wine, or soda.

09:34.153 --> 09:36.068
Oh, OK. Give me 6 beers.

09:36.103 --> 09:38.033
2 is the max.

09:38.068 --> 09:38.799
Jesus, with the rules

09:38.834 --> 09:39.867
Already. All right. Give me

09:39.902 --> 09:40.834
2 beers.

09:55.601 --> 09:56.399
Hey.

09:56.434 --> 09:57.100
Hey, ready to bang some

09:57.135 --> 09:57.767
Heads tonight, Tom?

09:57.802 --> 09:58.899
Yep.

09:58.934 --> 09:59.834
Yeah, I heard your probie

09:59.869 --> 10:01.051
Pulled stack out of

10:01.086 --> 10:02.198
A hot one yesterday.

10:02.233 --> 10:03.133
Yeah, man. It was pretty

10:03.168 --> 10:04.132
Awesome.

10:04.167 --> 10:05.001
Yeah, too bad you're gonna

10:05.036 --> 10:06.035
Lose him.

10:06.070 --> 10:06.999
Lose who?

10:07.034 --> 10:08.232
Probie. You don't know?

10:08.267 --> 10:09.417
What are you talking about?

10:09.452 --> 10:11.043
He was scouting out the 74

10:11.078 --> 10:12.523
Truck the other day. Noodle

10:12.558 --> 10:13.968
Nelson told me. He's gonna

10:14.003 --> 10:14.918
Transfer.

10:14.953 --> 10:15.799
Bullshit.

10:15.834 --> 10:17.068
No. Good guys at that house

10:17.103 --> 10:18.267
Though. Let's go.

10:32.334 --> 10:35.332
2 beers, please.

10:35.367 --> 10:36.165
Ladies and

10:36.200 --> 10:37.500
Gentlemen, before starting

10:37.535 --> 10:38.951
Tonight's contest, please rise

10:38.986 --> 10:40.676
To observe a moment of silence

10:40.711 --> 10:42.422
To convey our thoughts and

10:42.457 --> 10:44.045
Prayers for firefighter John

10:44.080 --> 10:45.634
Stackhouse who was critically

10:45.669 --> 10:46.832
Injured yesterday while

10:46.867 --> 10:48.767
Responding to a call in harlem.

10:54.068 --> 10:55.734
Get well soon, stack.

11:03.834 --> 11:04.701
All right. Let's play

11:04.736 --> 11:05.867
Some hockey.

11:20.001 --> 11:21.068
Yeah!

11:22.367 --> 11:22.834
Let's go.

11:39.068 --> 11:39.901
You're playing like a pussy

11:39.936 --> 11:40.634
Tonight, Gavin.

11:40.669 --> 11:41.332
Yeah.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.167
You taking your hormone

11:42.202 --> 11:42.799
Shots?

11:42.834 --> 11:43.734
I believe the proper term

11:43.769 --> 11:44.685
Is vagina, OK?

11:44.720 --> 11:45.566
You're a pussy.

11:45.601 --> 11:46.834
All right, asshole.

12:04.167 --> 12:05.100
Let's go. Let's get

12:05.135 --> 12:05.999
Another one.

12:06.034 --> 12:08.033
Let me guess. 2 beers?

12:08.068 --> 12:09.534
Actually, I'd like

12:09.569 --> 12:11.034
To try wine, please.

12:11.069 --> 12:12.535
You want red or white?

12:12.570 --> 12:14.001
One of each, please?

12:34.267 --> 12:35.034
You gonna hurry it up,

12:35.069 --> 12:36.133
Buddy?

12:54.601 --> 12:56.167
Too oaky. Double up on

12:56.202 --> 12:57.465
The red, please.

12:57.500 --> 12:58.467
I think you've had enough.

12:58.502 --> 12:59.400
OK.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.500
Gavin, Tommy. Line change.

13:05.535 --> 13:06.701
All right.

13:10.667 --> 13:11.467
Come on, get back and get

13:11.502 --> 13:13.467
Him, boy. Play d.

13:13.502 --> 13:14.399
Pussy.

13:14.434 --> 13:15.198
I hear your brother's got

13:15.233 --> 13:16.701
A big dick. Your wife told me.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.467
Let's go. Let's go.

13:34.267 --> 13:35.200
You OK? You look a little

13:35.235 --> 13:36.198
Woozy out there.

13:36.233 --> 13:36.968
Eat shit, you friggin'

13:37.003 --> 13:38.332
Gorilla.

13:38.367 --> 13:40.299
Let's go. Bring it on.

13:40.334 --> 13:41.901
What the hell are you doing?

13:41.936 --> 13:42.732
Pussy.

13:42.767 --> 13:43.567
That's right. Get him off

13:43.602 --> 13:44.835
The ice, you pansy.

13:44.870 --> 13:46.068
This game is nuts now.

13:46.103 --> 13:46.832
Now you know why

13:46.867 --> 13:47.734
Puerto ricans don't play hockey.

13:47.769 --> 13:48.566
Why is that?

13:48.601 --> 13:49.434
We'd all be carrying knives.

13:49.469 --> 13:50.384
It'd be a blood bath.

13:50.419 --> 13:51.309
Not to mention all of

13:51.344 --> 13:52.539
The hubcaps that would be

13:52.574 --> 13:53.734
Stolen off the zamboni.

13:53.769 --> 13:55.701
Come on!

14:21.701 --> 14:22.098
Gavin!

14:22.133 --> 14:23.534
What the hell, man, are you

14:23.569 --> 14:25.118
Crying?

14:25.153 --> 14:26.632
No.

14:26.667 --> 14:27.700
Jesus Christ. This ain't

14:27.735 --> 14:28.734
A ladies league, Tommy.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.750
I'm having a tough week, man,

14:33.785 --> 14:35.300
All right, so just don't bust

14:35.335 --> 14:37.767
My balls, man.

14:37.802 --> 14:40.200
Coming in waves?

14:43.667 --> 14:44.832
Yeah.

14:44.867 --> 14:46.068
Yeah. It's random. Never know

14:46.103 --> 14:47.334
When it's gonna happen.

14:57.001 --> 14:58.100
Survivor's guilt.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.800
You... you're like the second

15:04.835 --> 15:07.767
Person, like recently, that's...

15:07.802 --> 15:09.435
mentioned that to me.

15:09.470 --> 15:11.068
I had the same thing.

15:11.103 --> 15:12.098
Yeah?

15:12.133 --> 15:13.816
Yeah. I knew 8 guys down at

15:13.851 --> 15:16.075
Ground zero. One of them was

15:16.110 --> 15:17.855
My first partner. Guy showed me

15:17.890 --> 15:19.728
The ropes. Showed me how the

15:19.763 --> 15:22.298
Job worked. Took me under his

15:22.333 --> 15:24.366
Wing, and I had to give the

15:24.401 --> 15:26.400
Eulogy at his funeral mass.

15:26.435 --> 15:28.599
I started getting this

15:28.634 --> 15:29.767
Survivors' guilt about 3 days

15:29.802 --> 15:31.732
After we buried him.

15:31.767 --> 15:34.633
So... so did you... did you

15:34.668 --> 15:37.484
Talk to somebody or something?

15:37.519 --> 15:40.043
My dad. Yeah, his partner,

15:40.078 --> 15:41.906
His best friend, you know, got

15:41.941 --> 15:44.004
Shot in a drug bust like 20

15:44.039 --> 15:45.803
Years ago. My old man kicked

15:45.838 --> 15:47.836
This door in, he took the shots,

15:47.871 --> 15:49.969
And his partner took two right

15:50.004 --> 15:51.935
In the dome. So I figured he'd

15:51.970 --> 15:53.867
Be the guy to talk to. Find out

15:53.902 --> 15:55.365
How he coped.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.034
So what did he say?

15:58.069 --> 15:59.632
Zilch.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.634
Cracked me one on the face

16:01.669 --> 16:03.718
And told me to suck it up.

16:03.753 --> 16:05.576
"Walk it off," he says.

16:05.611 --> 16:07.400
That's what he told me.

16:07.435 --> 16:09.599
Walk it off.

16:09.634 --> 16:13.732
So, did you talk to, like,

16:13.767 --> 16:15.267
A doctor or somebody after that?

16:15.302 --> 16:17.367
Nah. Eventually I got a

16:17.402 --> 16:18.400
Handle on my own.

16:18.435 --> 16:21.068
How?

16:21.103 --> 16:23.268
Booze.

16:23.303 --> 16:25.399
Booze.

16:25.434 --> 16:26.899
Yeah. I drank a lot.

16:26.934 --> 16:28.234
I still do. I mean, I don't

16:28.269 --> 16:29.568
Drink on the job or anything.

16:29.603 --> 16:30.867
And I'm not drunk right now, but

16:30.902 --> 16:33.134
I will be pretty soon. Like

16:33.169 --> 16:35.485
Right after this. 12 beers,

16:35.520 --> 16:37.460
6 shots of tequila. That'll

16:37.495 --> 16:39.400
Pretty much knock it right out

16:39.435 --> 16:40.499
Of your system.

16:40.534 --> 16:43.198
Yeah. I can imagine.

16:43.233 --> 16:47.233
Well... thanks for the advice.

16:47.268 --> 16:49.065
No problem.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.500
You, uh, you want to go for one

16:51.535 --> 16:53.132
Maybe? Talk some more?

16:53.167 --> 16:55.200
No, actually I'm kind of on

16:55.235 --> 16:57.365
The wagon.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.467
Sorry. Good luck with

16:59.502 --> 17:01.718
That one.

17:01.753 --> 17:03.899
Hey, uh...

17:03.934 --> 17:06.800
you won't mention it to anybody.

17:06.836 --> 17:08.099
What am I, an asshole?

17:08.135 --> 17:09.098
I'm just saying.

17:09.133 --> 17:09.898
And I hear you telling

17:09.934 --> 17:11.217
Anybody about my thing, I'll

17:11.252 --> 17:12.500
Put one right in your ear, Tom.

17:12.535 --> 17:13.666
I swear to God.

17:13.702 --> 17:14.885
Deal?

17:14.920 --> 17:16.032
Deal.

17:16.068 --> 17:16.983
All right.

17:17.019 --> 17:17.866
Thanks.

17:17.901 --> 17:20.851
No problem.

17:20.886 --> 17:22.675
Oh, boy.

17:22.711 --> 17:24.432
Hey, Tommy.

17:24.467 --> 17:25.750
What's the matter?

17:25.785 --> 17:27.034
Oh, nothing, nothing.

17:27.069 --> 17:28.265
You all right?

17:28.300 --> 17:30.834
Yeah. I'm all right.

17:37.767 --> 17:42.065
Well, the truth is, uh...

17:42.100 --> 17:45.200
one of the guys mentioned to me

17:45.235 --> 17:46.265
That you were thinking of

17:46.300 --> 17:50.083
Transferring to another house.

17:50.118 --> 17:53.159
And, quite frankly, uh, you

17:53.194 --> 17:55.830
Know, it kind of shocked me.

17:55.865 --> 17:57.766
Cause, you know, you're really

17:57.801 --> 17:59.667
Starting to come into your own,

17:59.702 --> 18:01.332
You know, lately. Kind of

18:01.367 --> 18:06.100
Firefighting-Wise, and it hurt.

18:10.233 --> 18:11.500
Come here.

18:11.535 --> 18:12.732
What?

18:12.767 --> 18:16.332
Thanks, Tom.

18:16.367 --> 18:17.267
I don't want you to

18:17.302 --> 18:18.467
Leave, kid.

18:24.277 --> 18:25.244
Good morning.

18:25.279 --> 18:26.242
Hey.

18:26.277 --> 18:28.527
Where'd you get the cash?

18:28.562 --> 18:30.777
Birdy finally ponied up.

18:30.812 --> 18:32.044
Four hundred bucks.

18:32.079 --> 18:34.376
That's great.

18:34.411 --> 18:36.027
Yeah, now I can retire to

18:36.062 --> 18:37.753
The south of France and gorge

18:37.788 --> 18:39.444
Myself on red wine and crepes

18:39.479 --> 18:41.295
And stop bathing.

18:41.330 --> 18:43.076
It's a start.

18:43.111 --> 18:44.443
It's nowhere near a start.

18:44.478 --> 18:47.177
But I got a way of turning this

18:47.212 --> 18:48.276
Into something.

18:48.311 --> 18:50.010
You're gonna gamble it?

18:50.045 --> 18:51.694
I got a tip. Sure thing.

18:51.729 --> 18:53.309
There's no such thing as

18:53.344 --> 18:56.011
A sure thing. Let me help you.

18:56.046 --> 18:58.278
You've done enough.

18:58.313 --> 19:00.510
Boy, I wish you hadn't

19:00.545 --> 19:01.744
Said that.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.027
Look, rose, I don't want to

19:06.062 --> 19:08.019
Blame you, you know, but I don't

19:08.054 --> 19:09.599
Want your pity or your charity.

19:09.634 --> 19:11.422
If we didn't get mixed up in

19:11.457 --> 19:13.176
This, I'd still have bud's

19:13.211 --> 19:15.510
Money in hand, Jeannie would be

19:15.545 --> 19:17.211
Able to stay where she is.

19:17.246 --> 19:18.711
I could still go back to the

19:18.746 --> 19:21.011
Firehouse with some sliver of

19:21.046 --> 19:22.928
Dignity. But that's not the

19:22.963 --> 19:24.810
Way it happened. I need to take

19:24.845 --> 19:26.842
Care of my wife.

19:26.877 --> 19:28.560
I nearly forgot that there's

19:28.595 --> 19:30.244
Nothing more important in the

19:30.279 --> 19:31.610
World to me than that.

19:31.645 --> 19:35.443
Nothing.

19:35.478 --> 19:37.810
Boy, I wish I could say it

19:37.845 --> 19:39.111
Had been worth it.

19:41.710 --> 19:42.577
Maybe I'll see you around

19:42.612 --> 19:43.677
The neighborhood.

19:45.777 --> 19:48.277
Au revoir, you son of a bitch.

20:07.877 --> 20:09.111
Holy shit.

20:31.643 --> 20:32.343
Hello.

20:32.378 --> 20:33.244
Hey, it's me.

20:33.279 --> 20:34.675
Oh...

20:34.710 --> 20:36.460
look, I just wanted to call

20:36.495 --> 20:38.269
And apologize for the whole

20:38.304 --> 20:40.044
Not being able to come thing,

20:40.079 --> 20:41.142
You know?

20:41.177 --> 20:42.843
Yeah, is that hard on gone

20:42.878 --> 20:44.510
Yet, or did you use it to dial

20:44.545 --> 20:46.278
The phone?

20:46.313 --> 20:47.976
That's funny.

20:48.011 --> 20:49.344
Um, you know, I heard you

20:49.379 --> 20:50.677
Talking to your penis.

20:50.712 --> 20:51.575
What?

20:51.610 --> 20:52.943
Yeah, the other day in the

20:52.978 --> 20:54.277
Bathroom, I heard you talking

20:54.312 --> 20:55.575
To it.

20:55.610 --> 20:57.011
What... what exactly did you

20:57.046 --> 20:58.475
Hear me say?

20:58.510 --> 20:59.927
Well, I heard you tell it

20:59.962 --> 21:01.519
That you used to fantasize

21:01.554 --> 21:03.077
About me and you would go off

21:03.112 --> 21:05.745
In, like, 5 seconds.

21:05.780 --> 21:07.995
7 seconds. It was 7.

21:08.030 --> 21:10.176
OK, Tommy. Whatever,

21:10.211 --> 21:12.360
Whatever. This whole thing is

21:12.395 --> 21:14.510
Getting weird. I'm over it. I'm

21:14.545 --> 21:16.177
Really, I think I'm done.

21:16.212 --> 21:17.978
Oh, come on. Come on, ange.

21:18.013 --> 21:19.744
Give me another chance, OK?

21:19.779 --> 21:20.742
Why?

21:20.777 --> 21:21.860
Because just sitting here

21:21.895 --> 21:23.569
Listening to your voice, I'm

21:23.604 --> 21:25.340
Ready to shoot right now. I'd

21:25.375 --> 21:26.759
Do it to if my windshield

21:26.794 --> 21:28.144
Wipers were on the inside of

21:28.179 --> 21:29.575
My truck. Come on.

21:29.610 --> 21:31.427
Are you into me or not?

21:31.462 --> 21:33.209
Yeah, baby. Of course.

21:33.244 --> 21:37.543
Come on. How about Friday night?

21:37.578 --> 21:40.777
OK, but don't jerk off for

21:40.812 --> 21:41.844
A couple of days.

21:41.879 --> 21:42.742
You got it.

21:42.777 --> 21:46.244
OK. Hey, Tommy.

21:46.279 --> 21:47.076
Yeah.

21:47.111 --> 21:48.044
Pass the good news on to your

21:48.079 --> 21:53.378
Cock, OK?

22:08.111 --> 22:09.510
* well, every time I feel

22:09.545 --> 22:10.878
You're coming around

22:10.913 --> 22:12.176
You're going down

22:12.211 --> 22:13.727
You hit the ground with

22:13.762 --> 22:15.419
Every force, it makes

22:15.454 --> 22:17.416
No sense or foul.

22:17.451 --> 22:19.343
God bless the son now

22:19.378 --> 22:21.710
Make out the whole world...

22:27.044 --> 22:28.475
oh, sorry.

22:28.510 --> 22:29.277
What, you don't know how

22:29.312 --> 22:30.076
To knock?

22:30.111 --> 22:30.927
I know how to knock. It's

22:30.962 --> 22:31.744
Not like you were doing

22:31.779 --> 22:32.575
Anything.

22:32.610 --> 22:33.427
I wasn't doing anything.

22:33.462 --> 22:34.209
No, you're standing in

22:34.244 --> 22:35.410
Front of the mirror half naked,

22:35.445 --> 22:36.577
Holding a mini weed whacker up

22:36.612 --> 22:37.728
Against your nut Sack.

22:37.763 --> 22:39.203
That's nothing. Yeah, OK.

22:39.238 --> 22:40.424
I had an epiphany, Tom.

22:40.459 --> 22:41.610
You had an epiphany.

22:41.645 --> 22:42.475
Yeah.

22:42.510 --> 22:43.744
Yeah? Where'd you get that?

22:43.779 --> 22:44.542
Quiznos?

22:44.577 --> 22:45.743
No, asshole, I was sitting

22:45.778 --> 22:47.027
Here, I was stuffing my face,

22:47.062 --> 22:48.136
I was reading the paper, I'm

22:48.171 --> 22:49.390
Watching TV, I'm feeling

22:49.425 --> 22:50.918
Miserable about myself, you

22:50.953 --> 22:52.098
Know, Wednesday, and I look in

22:52.133 --> 22:53.138
The paper, and there happens to

22:53.173 --> 22:54.144
Be a little article about my

22:54.179 --> 22:55.376
Old friend candy.

22:55.411 --> 22:56.694
Oh, candy the high end

22:56.729 --> 22:57.953
Escort/porn actress.

22:57.988 --> 23:00.049
Make that the high-End

23:00.084 --> 23:01.997
Escort/porn actress/drug

23:02.032 --> 23:03.875
Dealer. She got busted

23:03.910 --> 23:05.860
Downtown for selling 2 ounces of

23:05.895 --> 23:07.786
Coke to some nightclub owner.

23:07.821 --> 23:09.265
Sadly for her, the nightclub

23:09.300 --> 23:10.522
Owner also happened to have

23:10.557 --> 23:12.217
A little tin star in his

23:12.252 --> 23:13.842
Pocket that said DEA.

23:13.877 --> 23:15.027
That's great, but it doesn't

23:15.062 --> 23:16.177
Explain why you were just in

23:16.212 --> 23:17.861
My toilet manscaping.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.475
I had an epiphany, Tom.

23:19.510 --> 23:21.277
I'm turning over a new leaf.

23:21.312 --> 23:22.176
A new leaf.

23:22.211 --> 23:24.411
Yeah. I mean, she's in jail.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.661
I can get over it.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.877
I got closure.

23:28.912 --> 23:30.176
Closure.

23:30.211 --> 23:31.042
I'm not gonna piss away

23:31.077 --> 23:32.577
The rest of my life, you know,

23:32.612 --> 23:34.011
Complaining about what a raw

23:34.046 --> 23:36.045
Deal I got. I'm not gonna be

23:36.080 --> 23:38.295
The same old eating, drinking,

23:38.330 --> 23:40.870
Sweating, scratching, out of

23:40.905 --> 23:43.411
Breath Lou anymore. This, my

23:43.446 --> 23:45.678
Friend, is the new Lou.

23:45.713 --> 23:47.910
This is the new Lou?

23:47.945 --> 23:48.909
Yeah.

23:48.944 --> 23:49.927
Interesting because the new

23:49.962 --> 23:51.153
Lou looks a lot like the old

23:51.188 --> 23:52.344
Lou minus a couple of patches of

23:52.379 --> 23:53.409
Pubic hair.

23:53.444 --> 23:54.744
I'm dead, goddamn serious,

23:54.779 --> 23:55.443
Tom.

23:55.478 --> 23:56.543
I know. I get it. You had a...

23:56.578 --> 23:58.209
an epiphany.

23:58.244 --> 24:00.475
Yeah. You know who else

24:00.510 --> 24:02.327
Had an epiphany once? Hitler.

24:02.362 --> 24:03.870
Yeah. Everybody woke up, and all

24:03.905 --> 24:05.378
Of a sudden, there were no more

24:05.413 --> 24:06.209
Bagels and cream cheese

24:06.244 --> 24:07.794
Available in downtown berlin,

24:07.829 --> 24:09.344
Not to mention lox and pastrami

24:09.379 --> 24:10.695
Sandwiches and speaking of

24:10.730 --> 24:12.011
Which, are you finished with

24:12.046 --> 24:13.009
This?

24:13.044 --> 24:15.877
It's all yours, mein fuhrer.

24:15.912 --> 24:17.011
Danke.

24:40.877 --> 24:41.927
What, are you slaughtering

24:41.962 --> 24:42.977
The lamb back there or what?

24:43.012 --> 24:43.775
Maggie, come on.

24:43.810 --> 24:45.127
Hey, Sean, did you hear,

24:45.162 --> 24:46.453
He just said something.

24:46.488 --> 24:47.449
He didn't say anything.

24:47.484 --> 24:48.376
Yeah, Sean, he did.

24:48.411 --> 24:49.610
Maggie, I'm not gonna fight

24:49.645 --> 24:50.810
The filafel guy just so that

24:50.845 --> 24:52.311
You can feel loved, OK?

24:52.346 --> 24:53.777
You made a face. You made

24:53.812 --> 24:54.709
A face, didn't you?

24:54.744 --> 24:55.777
He hasn't taken his eyes off

24:55.812 --> 24:56.944
The grill. I doubt the guy

24:56.979 --> 24:58.077
Even understands english.

24:59.910 --> 25:01.343
Camel jockey.

25:01.378 --> 25:03.111
See, you satisfied?

25:03.146 --> 25:04.508
No.

25:04.543 --> 25:05.643
All right, Maggie. What's it

25:05.678 --> 25:06.844
Gonna take, huh, for you to

25:06.879 --> 25:07.911
Feel love? What do you want,

25:07.946 --> 25:09.078
You want to get married, is that

25:09.113 --> 25:10.211
It? You want to live happily

25:10.246 --> 25:11.111
Ever after?

25:11.146 --> 25:11.942
Yeah, yeah.

25:11.977 --> 25:12.860
What? What did you say?

25:12.895 --> 25:13.744
You asked me to marry you,

25:13.779 --> 25:14.475
I'm saying yes.

25:14.510 --> 25:15.378
No, no, I meant that l...

25:15.413 --> 25:16.675
when I said that...

25:16.710 --> 25:17.510
now you don't want to get

25:17.545 --> 25:18.242
Married?

25:18.277 --> 25:19.327
No, no. I just, I guess...

25:19.362 --> 25:20.386
I mean, we've only been

25:20.421 --> 25:21.432
Engaged 15 seconds, you're

25:21.467 --> 25:22.688
Already getting cold feet?

25:22.723 --> 25:24.316
I guess we could get married.

25:24.351 --> 25:25.614
I mean, I love you, and I'm

25:25.649 --> 25:26.877
Pretty sure that you love me.

25:26.912 --> 25:27.710
Even though you've never

25:27.745 --> 25:30.044
Actually said it.

25:30.079 --> 25:33.875
Sand spook.

25:33.910 --> 25:35.410
I guess you're right.

25:35.445 --> 25:36.910
Maggie Gavin, will you

25:36.945 --> 25:38.443
Marry me?

25:38.478 --> 25:39.244
I already said yes, doofus.

25:39.279 --> 25:40.011
Come on. You're totally

25:40.046 --> 25:40.712
Serious?

25:40.747 --> 25:41.343
Yes.

25:41.378 --> 25:42.177
You're gonna marry me?

25:42.212 --> 25:42.942
Yes.

25:42.977 --> 25:44.327
Oh, that is awesome.

25:44.362 --> 25:45.586
This is awesome.

25:45.621 --> 25:46.649
OK, so let's go.

25:46.684 --> 25:47.642
Yeah. Go where?

25:47.677 --> 25:48.777
Let's go to city hall.

25:48.812 --> 25:49.775
For what?

25:49.810 --> 25:50.993
Marriage license, justice of

25:51.028 --> 25:52.177
The peace. You know, marriage,

25:52.212 --> 25:53.009
Come on.

25:53.044 --> 25:53.827
No, I can't do that right

25:53.862 --> 25:54.586
Now. I can't do that.

25:54.621 --> 25:55.276
It was your idea.

25:55.311 --> 25:56.176
I got to tell my folks.

25:56.211 --> 25:57.344
I mean, my mother would kill me.

25:57.379 --> 25:58.444
Your mom? Oh, my God.

25:58.479 --> 25:59.475
Come on. It's a big deal

25:59.510 --> 26:00.877
For me, Maggie. I want it to be

26:00.912 --> 26:02.094
Like a wedding wedding with a

26:02.129 --> 26:03.277
Church and the organ music and

26:03.312 --> 26:04.242
Flowers and shit.

26:04.277 --> 26:05.360
Now I'm getting cold feet.

26:05.395 --> 26:06.386
I've been down the aisle 3

26:06.421 --> 26:07.378
Times and none of that shit

26:07.413 --> 26:08.343
Buys you any luck.

26:08.378 --> 26:09.709
But it's my first time, OK,

26:09.744 --> 26:11.044
So I might want, you know, a lot

26:11.079 --> 26:13.045
Of people there and flowers

26:13.080 --> 26:15.012
And music. Who knows, I may

26:15.047 --> 26:16.944
Want to sing you a song. Like

26:16.979 --> 26:18.011
An elton John song. Like

26:18.046 --> 26:18.976
Your song.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.809
Music and flowers and

26:20.844 --> 26:23.044
Elton John? How gay can you get?

26:23.079 --> 26:24.343
Please?

26:24.378 --> 26:25.610
You're such a whiny, little

26:25.645 --> 26:26.777
Bitch.

26:30.577 --> 26:31.710
Poor bastard.

26:34.944 --> 26:36.877
Ahem.

26:36.912 --> 26:38.775
Namaste.

26:38.810 --> 26:40.575
OK. I'm thinking about

26:40.610 --> 26:41.775
Getting into my old workout

26:41.810 --> 26:43.011
Routine, you know, free weights,

26:43.046 --> 26:45.178
Nautilus, racquet ball,

26:45.213 --> 26:47.311
Stairmaster, lats, abs, you

26:47.346 --> 26:48.309
Know, all that shit.

26:48.344 --> 26:49.810
We're not that kind of gym.

26:49.845 --> 26:51.977
This is a yoga gym.

26:52.012 --> 26:53.142
Oh, yoga, eh?

26:53.177 --> 26:55.542
It's a great workout.

26:55.577 --> 26:57.394
Really? I thought you just

26:57.429 --> 26:59.211
Kind of flopped around on the

26:59.246 --> 27:00.376
Floor for an hour or so.

27:00.411 --> 27:01.478
I do that at home every day of

27:01.513 --> 27:02.309
The week.

27:02.344 --> 27:03.675
Oh, it's really quite

27:03.710 --> 27:05.060
Rigorous. Most people can't

27:05.095 --> 27:06.411
Believe how sore they are after

27:06.446 --> 27:07.543
Their first try.

27:07.578 --> 27:08.443
Really?

27:08.478 --> 27:09.242
It works every muscle of

27:09.277 --> 27:10.910
Your body, but it's more than

27:10.945 --> 27:12.361
That. It's about a state

27:12.396 --> 27:14.203
Of mind. A lifestyle.

27:14.238 --> 27:15.976
Getting centered.

27:16.011 --> 27:17.744
I could use some of that.

27:17.779 --> 27:20.011
My name's epiphany.

27:20.046 --> 27:21.628
Come on.

27:21.663 --> 27:23.176
What?

27:23.211 --> 27:25.277
No, I'm sorry. I've just had

27:25.312 --> 27:27.344
Kind of a strange day. I'm ken.

27:27.379 --> 27:28.508
Hi, ken.

27:28.543 --> 27:29.977
Why don't you take my class

27:30.012 --> 27:31.128
Once. If you don't like it,

27:31.163 --> 27:32.244
You don't have to pay for it.

27:32.279 --> 27:34.642
What do you say?

27:34.677 --> 27:36.910
I say, lead the way.

27:36.945 --> 27:38.844
You did a nice job with

27:38.879 --> 27:40.744
The room, mo. Chapel looks

27:40.779 --> 27:41.443
Beautiful.

27:41.478 --> 27:42.510
You're not supposed to have

27:42.545 --> 27:43.778
No flowers or nothing, but me

27:43.813 --> 27:45.011
And the boys, we pulled some

27:45.046 --> 27:45.909
Strings.

27:45.944 --> 27:46.744
I appreciate it. It's a

27:46.779 --> 27:47.575
Special day.

27:47.610 --> 27:48.810
Hey, guys. Who's the charlie

27:48.845 --> 27:50.011
Manson lookalike over by

27:50.046 --> 27:51.009
The door?

27:51.044 --> 27:52.011
Ellie's ex. He's giving her

27:52.046 --> 27:53.142
Away.

27:53.177 --> 27:54.627
Where'd she meet him,

27:54.662 --> 27:56.077
Hell's angels rally?

27:56.112 --> 27:57.109
Here.

27:57.144 --> 27:58.311
Yeah, he's on death row for

27:58.346 --> 27:59.478
Killing two guys with a shovel.

27:59.513 --> 28:01.042
A shovel?

28:01.077 --> 28:02.144
He served 5 years till his

28:02.179 --> 28:03.295
Lawyer found a couple of holes

28:03.330 --> 28:04.411
In the case, bam, they had to

28:04.446 --> 28:05.109
Let him go.

28:05.144 --> 28:05.977
Week later, he's on the

28:06.012 --> 28:06.810
Outside, she's filing for

28:06.845 --> 28:07.542
Divorce.

28:07.577 --> 28:08.593
He keeps sending her letters

28:08.628 --> 28:09.752
Saying, you know, I'm free, but

28:09.787 --> 28:11.748
I'm still guilty of the crime.

28:11.783 --> 28:13.830
So why is he giving her away?

28:13.865 --> 28:15.704
She's got no family. Snake's

28:15.739 --> 28:17.543
All she's got witness wise.

28:17.578 --> 28:18.875
His name is snake?

28:18.910 --> 28:20.110
Yeah, and according to her,

28:20.145 --> 28:21.311
It's not because of the size

28:21.346 --> 28:23.209
Of his cock.

28:23.244 --> 28:25.111
Gentlemen. It's time.

28:31.577 --> 28:34.242
Oh, yeah, daddy.

28:34.277 --> 28:36.644
Next posture. Put your hands

28:36.679 --> 28:38.594
On the mat. Feet together.

28:38.629 --> 28:40.510
Legs up over the head.

28:40.545 --> 28:42.411
And exhale.

28:46.411 --> 28:47.244
Why is it so hot in here?

28:47.279 --> 28:48.195
We turn the heat up on

28:48.230 --> 28:49.111
Purpose. It stretches the

28:49.146 --> 28:50.475
Muscles and tendons.

28:50.510 --> 28:51.610
I feel like I'm melting,

28:51.645 --> 28:52.709
And I'm a fireman.

28:52.744 --> 28:54.309
You're doing great. Now

28:54.344 --> 28:55.810
Remember to breathe. Legs up

28:55.845 --> 28:56.909
Over the head.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.110
Oh! Mother of God.

28:58.145 --> 28:59.277
Remember to breathe.

29:03.744 --> 29:04.642
Sorry.

29:04.677 --> 29:05.677
It's just the gasses shifting

29:05.712 --> 29:06.677
Inside your body. It's perfectly

29:06.712 --> 29:08.109
Natural.

29:08.144 --> 29:09.677
I know. But it doesn't

29:09.712 --> 29:11.608
Make it right.

29:11.643 --> 29:15.044
And legs down. And breathe.

29:18.478 --> 29:20.642
Theodore, I've loved you

29:20.677 --> 29:22.544
From the first time I saw your

29:22.579 --> 29:24.011
Picture on the news. And I

29:24.046 --> 29:25.878
Heard what you did to that

29:25.913 --> 29:27.528
Piece of garbage drunk driver.

29:27.563 --> 29:29.320
May he burn in hell for all

29:29.355 --> 29:31.042
Eternity. And then when I

29:31.077 --> 29:33.210
Finally met you, and you asked

29:33.245 --> 29:35.361
Me to be your wife, all my

29:35.396 --> 29:37.478
Dreams were fulfilled.

29:37.513 --> 29:38.561
Ellie?

29:38.596 --> 29:39.575
Hmm?

29:39.610 --> 29:41.576
I looked through a lot of

29:41.611 --> 29:43.494
8 x 10s to find you. But when

29:43.529 --> 29:45.453
I laid eyes on that onion, I

29:45.488 --> 29:46.882
Knew you were the one for me.

29:46.917 --> 29:48.313
And even though my body's

29:48.348 --> 29:49.829
Confined in here by concrete,

29:49.864 --> 29:51.437
Steel, barbed wire, and men

29:51.472 --> 29:53.241
With guns, my heart and soul

29:53.276 --> 29:54.643
Walk out that door with you.

29:54.678 --> 29:56.011
Right after we bang out that

29:56.046 --> 29:57.076
Conjugal visit.

29:57.111 --> 29:58.311
Well, you better be guilty.

29:58.346 --> 29:59.242
I'll break your neck.

29:59.277 --> 30:00.310
Yeah, just try it, asshole.

30:00.345 --> 30:01.511
Come on, I got a shovel out in

30:01.546 --> 30:02.677
My trunk with your name on it.

30:02.712 --> 30:03.994
Get him out. Get him out

30:04.029 --> 30:05.353
Of here. You're done.

30:05.388 --> 30:06.682
No, no, we're not done!

30:06.717 --> 30:07.942
Padre, are we married?

30:07.977 --> 30:09.127
By the power vested in me,

30:09.162 --> 30:10.277
I now pronounce you man

30:10.312 --> 30:11.176
And wife.

30:11.211 --> 30:12.109
What about my conjugal

30:12.144 --> 30:13.393
Visits? I need to get laid!

30:13.428 --> 30:14.643
That's over now. You know

30:14.678 --> 30:15.809
The rules. Sorry.

30:15.844 --> 30:16.710
Well, let me just see your

30:16.745 --> 30:17.875
Ass just once.

30:17.910 --> 30:19.843
Show him your ass.

30:19.878 --> 30:21.742
That's just cruel and

30:21.777 --> 30:25.910
Unusual punishment. No! No!

30:25.945 --> 30:28.076
No!

30:28.111 --> 30:29.610
Nice rack, huh?

30:32.211 --> 30:33.378
Al yi yi.

30:37.043 --> 30:37.777
Can I get you another

30:37.812 --> 30:38.576
Margarita?

30:38.611 --> 30:39.777
Uh, I'm good actually.

30:39.812 --> 30:40.609
Thanks.

30:40.644 --> 30:41.444
OK. Just let me know if you

30:41.479 --> 30:42.844
Need anything else.

30:42.879 --> 30:45.242
Will do.

30:45.277 --> 30:47.644
Ooh, she likes you.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.309
You think?

30:49.344 --> 30:51.644
I know. She's hot. You should

30:51.679 --> 30:52.876
Go for it.

30:52.911 --> 30:53.742
You know, I've dated

30:53.777 --> 30:54.844
Bartenders before. It never

30:54.879 --> 30:55.761
Works out. I mean, they're

30:55.796 --> 30:56.736
Very appealing when they're

30:56.771 --> 30:57.641
Serving you drinks, and there's

30:57.676 --> 30:58.859
3 feet of pine between the two

30:58.894 --> 30:59.919
Of you, but once you get rid

30:59.954 --> 31:00.944
Of the buffer, you can never

31:00.979 --> 31:02.544
Get rid of them.

31:02.579 --> 31:04.075
I'm natalie.

31:04.110 --> 31:07.410
Hi, natalie. I'm Franco.

31:07.445 --> 31:08.927
Nice to meet you.

31:08.962 --> 31:10.375
Same to you.

31:10.410 --> 31:11.777
So you're flying solo

31:11.812 --> 31:12.709
Tonight?

31:12.744 --> 31:13.777
Yeah, unfortunately. I

31:13.812 --> 31:14.811
Couldn't raise a wingman.

31:14.846 --> 31:16.042
How about yourself?

31:16.077 --> 31:17.310
I just stopped in for one on

31:17.345 --> 31:18.777
My way home from work.

31:18.812 --> 31:20.378
What do you do?

31:20.413 --> 31:21.962
I'm a bartender.

31:21.997 --> 31:23.670
Oh, uh, I...

31:23.705 --> 31:25.208
that was a joke.

31:25.243 --> 31:26.676
I'm a photographer.

31:26.711 --> 31:29.194
> Oh. Cool. I mean, like for

31:29.229 --> 31:31.169
What, a magazine or something?

31:31.204 --> 31:33.075
Photo journalism is how I

31:33.110 --> 31:35.060
Pay the rent. But it's the art

31:35.095 --> 31:37.010
Of it that appeals to me. I like

31:37.045 --> 31:39.344
To photograph people in the

31:39.379 --> 31:41.644
Park, on the street. Faces tell

31:41.679 --> 31:43.042
A story.

31:43.077 --> 31:45.711
Really? So what story does

31:45.746 --> 31:46.809
My face tell?

31:46.844 --> 31:49.043
I wouldn't know until I

31:49.078 --> 31:50.476
Photographed it.

31:50.511 --> 31:51.944
But I'm guessing it's a

31:51.979 --> 31:53.843
Complicated one.

31:53.878 --> 31:55.094
No, not really. It's not

31:55.129 --> 31:56.586
That complicated. I mean, I

31:56.621 --> 31:57.899
Wake up. I go to work, maybe

31:57.934 --> 31:59.177
Hit the gym, grab something to

31:59.212 --> 32:00.578
Eat and go to bed.

32:00.613 --> 32:01.909
Simple as that.

32:01.944 --> 32:06.210
It's never as simple as that.

32:09.511 --> 32:11.011
Hey, dude. Where you been?

32:11.046 --> 32:12.528
Uh, I just grabbed a beer

32:12.563 --> 32:14.153
After work with Tommy.

32:14.188 --> 32:15.832
Oh, yeah. Where at?

32:15.867 --> 32:17.672
Uh, flanagan's.

32:17.707 --> 32:19.477
Up on 60th.

32:19.512 --> 32:20.594
Yeah.

32:20.629 --> 32:21.642
Yeah.

32:21.677 --> 32:24.260
Well, uh, flanagan's is on

32:24.295 --> 32:26.844
15th, Mike. Hey, let me check

32:26.879 --> 32:28.094
This out.

32:28.129 --> 32:29.275
Get off.

32:29.310 --> 32:30.127
You're banging that chick

32:30.162 --> 32:30.944
From the bar, aren't you?

32:30.979 --> 32:31.642
No.

32:31.677 --> 32:32.477
Oh, you're so full of shit,

32:32.512 --> 32:33.242
Mike.

32:33.277 --> 32:34.075
I am not.

32:34.110 --> 32:35.126
Hey, dude. I'm a guy, you're

32:35.161 --> 32:36.143
A guy. We both know guys screw

32:36.178 --> 32:37.108
Around, but you told me,

32:37.143 --> 32:38.444
You told me you were a one-Guy

32:38.479 --> 32:39.242
Guy.

32:39.277 --> 32:40.410
I am. That's why I'm screwing

32:40.445 --> 32:41.542
Around with a woman.

32:41.577 --> 32:42.943
Ah, see? See, I knew it, man.

32:42.978 --> 32:44.544
You're such a jerk off, Mike.

32:44.579 --> 32:46.294
I'm sorry, Chris. You know,

32:46.329 --> 32:48.010
This thing, I'm confused.

32:48.045 --> 32:49.776
I miss pussy.

32:49.811 --> 32:51.944
Oh, so you're flipping?

32:51.979 --> 32:53.576
I'm on the fence.

32:53.611 --> 32:55.377
Oh, OK. Well, until you get

32:55.412 --> 32:56.994
Off the fence and get back in

32:57.029 --> 32:58.577
The gay yard where you belong,

32:58.612 --> 32:59.609
I want you out of here.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.027
All right, go stay with your

33:01.062 --> 33:02.410
Little fag hag girlfriend.

33:02.445 --> 33:03.661
Chris...

33:03.696 --> 33:04.886
get out!

33:04.921 --> 33:06.077
OK.

33:17.644 --> 33:18.878
Santa Maria.

33:18.913 --> 33:21.209
What?

33:21.244 --> 33:22.444
That was not at all what

33:22.479 --> 33:23.844
I was expecting.

33:23.879 --> 33:25.195
Which was?

33:25.230 --> 33:26.720
Truth?

33:26.755 --> 33:28.175
Always.

33:28.210 --> 33:29.343
I don't know, I guess I was

33:29.378 --> 33:30.644
Expecting to go out, you know.

33:30.679 --> 33:31.978
Pick up some chippie and bring

33:32.013 --> 33:33.362
Her back to my crib. Bang her

33:33.397 --> 33:34.870
Brains out to forget about some

33:34.905 --> 33:36.344
Shit, but you know, with you,

33:36.379 --> 33:37.911
It was, like, uh...

33:37.946 --> 33:39.110
like what?

33:44.577 --> 33:46.327
We just met, right? So, at

33:46.362 --> 33:47.803
The risk of incriminating

33:47.838 --> 33:49.209
Myself, it was just not my

33:49.244 --> 33:50.777
Normal thing, you know. I mean,

33:50.812 --> 33:54.309
Slow, soft, face to face.

33:54.344 --> 33:55.978
Eye contact. It was just, um...

33:56.013 --> 33:58.645
it's called intimacy.

33:58.680 --> 34:01.242
I'm not familiar.

34:01.277 --> 34:04.577
So, this... shit you're trying

34:04.612 --> 34:07.011
To forget, what's her name?

34:07.046 --> 34:09.375
No, no. No, no, no. I think

34:09.409 --> 34:10.344
It's a little soon for that much

34:10.379 --> 34:11.377
Truth.

34:17.744 --> 34:18.677
And where do you think you're

34:18.712 --> 34:19.742
Going?

34:19.777 --> 34:24.708
I am gonna go pee. And then

34:24.744 --> 34:27.244
I'm gonna get my camera and take

34:27.279 --> 34:28.995
Your picture. That way you won't

34:29.030 --> 34:30.710
Have to tell me a thing because

34:30.746 --> 34:32.242
I'll already know.

34:32.277 --> 34:33.560
Where's your bathroom?

34:33.594 --> 34:34.844
Right down the hall and

34:34.879 --> 34:35.975
To the left.

34:36.010 --> 34:37.244
Don't run off on me now.

35:29.244 --> 35:30.644
Oh...

35:32.410 --> 35:33.611
hey, good morning, sunshine.

35:33.646 --> 35:34.542
You're up early.

35:34.577 --> 35:35.342
Well, it's not like I had

35:35.377 --> 35:36.277
A choice, Sean. You're ruining

35:36.312 --> 35:37.227
My chi here.

35:37.262 --> 35:38.103
Your what?

35:38.138 --> 35:38.909
My chi.

35:38.944 --> 35:39.993
What the hell is that?

35:40.028 --> 35:41.043
Hey, there he is. Good

35:41.078 --> 35:41.761
Morning, bro.

35:41.796 --> 35:42.409
You let him in?

35:42.444 --> 35:43.477
No, I just came by to help

35:43.512 --> 35:44.511
Patch things up, you know.

35:44.546 --> 35:45.478
Brought some tools and wood

35:45.513 --> 35:46.428
And stuff. Thought I would make

35:46.463 --> 35:47.344
A little project out of it.

35:47.379 --> 35:48.344
A project.

35:48.379 --> 35:49.275
Yeah.

35:49.310 --> 35:50.542
You forgot my green tea.

35:50.577 --> 35:51.377
Richard gere was in front of

35:51.412 --> 35:52.143
Me in line and wiped

35:52.178 --> 35:53.075
The place out.

35:53.110 --> 35:53.978
Guess what, bro. I got big

35:54.013 --> 35:54.843
News.

35:54.878 --> 35:55.811
Uh, you're leaving.

35:55.846 --> 35:56.744
No. It concerns me

35:56.779 --> 35:57.811
And Maggie.

35:57.846 --> 35:58.809
Yeah.

35:58.844 --> 35:59.476
You killed her.

35:59.511 --> 36:00.444
No. Quite the opposite. We

36:00.479 --> 36:02.943
Are getting married.

36:02.978 --> 36:03.777
So you'll kill her in, like

36:03.812 --> 36:04.476
3 years.

36:04.511 --> 36:05.394
No, come on. Why can't you

36:05.429 --> 36:06.336
Guys be happy for me. This is

36:06.371 --> 36:07.244
Like a big deal. We're gonna

36:07.279 --> 36:08.095
Be bros.

36:08.130 --> 36:08.876
Get off me.

36:08.911 --> 36:09.660
We're gonna do all kinds of

36:09.695 --> 36:10.502
Great stuff. We're gonna go

36:10.537 --> 36:11.390
Biking and hiking and camping

36:11.425 --> 36:12.209
And hanging out, you know.

36:12.244 --> 36:13.043
Ballgames. It's gonna be great.

36:13.078 --> 36:13.809
Did you say camping?

36:13.844 --> 36:14.644
Yes, I did. I got a tent

36:14.679 --> 36:15.442
And everything.

36:15.477 --> 36:17.327
That's cool. Can I borrow

36:17.362 --> 36:18.670
Your hammer? Thanks, man.

36:18.705 --> 36:19.891
Just hit me once on the side

36:19.926 --> 36:20.885
Of the head. Actually 4 times.

36:20.920 --> 36:21.844
Are you giving me immunity?

36:21.879 --> 36:22.210
Yep.

36:26.311 --> 36:27.811
Ah, I can't believe how

36:27.846 --> 36:29.345
Sore I am. That stupid yoga

36:29.380 --> 36:30.945
Workout. I didn't lift a thing.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.511
I'm not so sure about that,

36:32.546 --> 36:33.376
Lou.

36:33.411 --> 36:34.977
Hey, uh, any of you guys

36:35.012 --> 36:36.509
Ever bang an artist?

36:36.544 --> 36:37.727
No, but robert maplethorpe

36:37.762 --> 36:39.103
Once shoved the business end

36:39.138 --> 36:40.674
Of a bullwhip up my ass.

36:40.709 --> 36:41.826
God, I miss the '80s.

36:41.861 --> 36:42.944
Why, are you banging an

36:42.979 --> 36:43.742
Artist, frank?

36:43.777 --> 36:44.642
Uh, I really wouldn't say

36:44.677 --> 36:45.827
I banged her. I mean, you know

36:45.862 --> 36:46.953
Me, I usually go at it like an

36:46.988 --> 36:48.166
Oil well, but I don't know, with

36:48.201 --> 36:49.344
Nat, it's kind of different.

36:49.379 --> 36:50.342
Really, like how?

36:50.377 --> 36:52.777
I guess you could say we

36:52.812 --> 36:53.675
Made love.

36:53.710 --> 36:55.077
Oh, really? Like on a beach

36:55.112 --> 36:56.076
In the moonlight?

36:56.111 --> 36:57.111
Yeah. Might as well have

36:57.146 --> 36:57.708
Been.

36:57.743 --> 36:58.593
So, you're in love with her?

36:58.628 --> 36:59.419
No, man. Jesus Christ, we

36:59.454 --> 37:00.176
Just met. I don't fall

37:00.211 --> 37:01.677
That fast. I mean, she's just

37:01.712 --> 37:03.144
All deep and shit. I don't know,

37:03.179 --> 37:03.944
I kind of like it.

37:03.979 --> 37:04.710
Good for you, kid.

37:04.745 --> 37:05.409
Enjoy it.

37:05.444 --> 37:06.211
Hey, you can bring her to

37:06.246 --> 37:07.278
The wedding.

37:07.313 --> 37:08.276
Hey, Tommy.

37:08.311 --> 37:09.794
Hi. What's going on?

37:09.829 --> 37:11.036
What's up, bro?

37:11.071 --> 37:12.209
What's happening?

37:12.244 --> 37:14.810
I just talked to Scott's wife.

37:14.845 --> 37:15.742
How's he doing?

37:15.777 --> 37:18.209
It's bad. Real bad.

37:18.244 --> 37:19.111
Jesus, man. That guy was

37:19.146 --> 37:20.109
A rock.

37:20.144 --> 37:23.077
Is. Is a rock.

37:25.511 --> 37:27.644
Yeah. OK. Thanks, lump. Good.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.244
All right, pony up, ladies.

37:29.279 --> 37:30.728
We're gonna ride national

37:30.763 --> 37:31.886
Anthem to the promised land.

37:31.921 --> 37:32.899
This the reliable source

37:32.934 --> 37:33.877
We're talking about?

37:33.912 --> 37:34.708
You're right.

37:34.743 --> 37:35.627
It's a guy named lump who

37:35.662 --> 37:36.652
Works at the track. Where's

37:36.687 --> 37:37.515
Your faith in humanity?

37:37.550 --> 37:38.309
I think I left that down

37:38.344 --> 37:39.244
At the southern tip of Manhattan

37:39.279 --> 37:40.409
About 41/2 years ago.

37:40.444 --> 37:41.277
Chief, I'll take 30 on that

37:41.312 --> 37:42.109
Action.

37:42.144 --> 37:43.227
Put me in for 25.

37:43.262 --> 37:44.370
I'll take 10.

37:44.405 --> 37:45.478
I got 3.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.775
3.

37:47.810 --> 37:48.842
Yeah. I got a wedding to

37:48.877 --> 37:50.144
Pay for. Tommy's old man sure

37:50.179 --> 37:51.828
Ain't footing the bill.

37:51.863 --> 37:53.170
Lou? Come on. You love to

37:53.205 --> 37:54.478
Gamble. You know how much fun

37:54.513 --> 37:55.176
It is.

37:55.211 --> 37:56.109
No means no.

37:56.144 --> 37:57.127
No time for delay. Hey, kid,

37:57.162 --> 37:58.353
Take ths money down to otb.

37:58.388 --> 37:59.515
I've never been to an otb.

37:59.550 --> 38:00.630
Now you'll be charmed. Just

38:00.665 --> 38:02.154
Go up to the window and get 4

38:02.189 --> 38:03.616

38:03.651 --> 38:05.044
Over the two, and the 10 in the

Fifth race at Santa anita.

Um, 4 $100 exactas, the 6

38:10.578 --> 38:12.211
Horse over the 2, and the 10 at

The fifth race at Santa anita.

38:13.879 --> 38:14.875
Got it.

38:14.910 --> 38:15.877
Post time's in 20 minutes.

38:16.996 --> 38:18.010
Suburban. Go, go, go, go.

38:18.944 --> 38:20.144
Probie, good luck.

38:20.179 --> 38:21.309
Yeah, good luck.

38:21.344 --> 38:22.077
Another 20 bucks says the

38:22.112 --> 38:22.877
Kid never makes it.

38:22.912 --> 38:24.342
I'm in.

38:24.377 --> 38:25.610
Let's see what we got.

38:42.643 --> 38:43.578
How you doing, Mike,

38:43.613 --> 38:44.544
You all right?

38:52.311 --> 38:54.610
Hey, you like this dress?

38:54.645 --> 38:56.875
With your back, I'd go

38:56.910 --> 38:58.143
Strapless, Sean. I mean, if

38:58.178 --> 38:59.244
It's cool out, you can always

38:59.279 --> 39:00.311
Wear, you know, like a light

39:00.346 --> 39:01.076
Shawl.

39:01.111 --> 39:02.042
For Maggie. Hello.

39:02.077 --> 39:03.160
I think she can sober up

39:03.195 --> 39:04.244
Long enough to pick out her

39:04.279 --> 39:05.276
Own dress.

39:05.311 --> 39:06.111
She doesn't want to be

39:06.146 --> 39:07.009
Involved.

39:07.044 --> 39:08.077
You guys set a date yet?

39:08.112 --> 39:09.328
Oh, my God. Don't scare me.

39:09.363 --> 39:10.544
There's just too much to do.

39:10.579 --> 39:11.742
Who's the best man?

39:11.777 --> 39:13.710
Um, well, sorry, boys, but

39:13.745 --> 39:15.643
Family first. Right, t?

39:18.077 --> 39:19.710
Did you just touch my ass?

39:24.311 --> 39:25.344
Hold up, kid. Hold up.

39:25.379 --> 39:27.861
Go, probie. Go.

39:27.896 --> 39:30.344
Excuse me.

39:33.478 --> 39:36.110
Hi. I need 4 $100 exactas,

39:36.145 --> 39:38.427
The 5 horse over the 2, and

39:38.462 --> 39:40.710
The 10 in the fifth race at

39:40.745 --> 39:41.743
Santa anita.

39:47.244 --> 39:48.993
Green tea. Yummy.

39:49.028 --> 39:51.186
OK, you know what?

39:51.221 --> 39:53.344
Her, I'd marry.

39:53.379 --> 39:54.745
Oh, jeez.

39:54.780 --> 39:56.076
Yeah.

39:56.111 --> 39:57.261
Shit, guys. You should've

39:57.296 --> 39:58.420
Seen us. Me and nilsy were

39:58.455 --> 39:59.466
Bombing down broadway, and we

39:59.501 --> 40:00.572
Almost clipped this homeless

40:00.607 --> 40:01.742
Dude. It was sick. I almost

40:01.777 --> 40:02.944
Shit myself. And then I get to

40:02.979 --> 40:04.778
The window, and I only had 20

40:04.813 --> 40:06.395
Seconds to... what's wrong?

40:06.430 --> 40:08.270
They're all tuckered out

40:08.305 --> 40:10.624
After a day of fun gambling.

40:10.659 --> 40:12.568
Oh, shit. The 5 horse lost?

40:12.603 --> 40:14.357
No, we all lost. What did

40:14.392 --> 40:16.076
You say, the 5 horse?

40:16.111 --> 40:17.311
Yeah, that's what you told

40:17.346 --> 40:19.176
Me to bet, right?

40:19.211 --> 40:20.444
Holy shit, you stupid son

40:20.479 --> 40:21.677
Of a bitch. Come here,

40:21.712 --> 40:22.642
I love you.

40:22.677 --> 40:23.377
Chief, should we leave the

40:23.412 --> 40:24.209
Room, what?

40:24.244 --> 40:25.277
He bet the wrong horse.

40:25.312 --> 40:26.477
The horse that he bet won.

40:26.512 --> 40:27.643
This thing's worth 15 grand.

40:27.678 --> 40:29.544
We hit it!

40:36.044 --> 40:37.242
Hey.

40:37.277 --> 40:38.410
Let's play a game. I'm gonna

40:38.445 --> 40:39.544
Get you off in two minutes.

40:39.579 --> 40:40.409
OK.

40:40.444 --> 40:41.176
OK? Don't think about

40:41.211 --> 40:42.411
Baseball. Don't think about

40:42.446 --> 40:43.608
Football. OK?

40:43.643 --> 40:44.843
Don't think about nuns.

40:44.878 --> 40:45.911
Don't think about priests.

40:45.946 --> 40:47.178
Why'd you bring them up?

40:47.213 --> 40:48.376
Just focus on me, OK?

40:48.411 --> 40:49.511
My tits, my ass, my mouth.

40:49.546 --> 40:50.842
All right, OK?

40:50.877 --> 40:53.910
My tits, my ass, and

40:53.945 --> 40:54.742
My mouth.

40:54.777 --> 40:55.977
Oh, tits, ass, mouth, OK.

40:56.012 --> 40:58.077
Tits, ass... oh...

41:00.211 --> 41:07.342
oh... wow.

41:07.377 --> 41:09.342
God, you're hot.

41:09.377 --> 41:12.777
Oh... that was good, right?

41:12.812 --> 41:14.076
Oh, that was fast.

41:14.111 --> 41:15.710
Yeah, but fast is good,

41:15.745 --> 41:16.708
Right?

41:16.743 --> 41:18.009
It was fast.

41:18.044 --> 41:19.444
It was, what, like 15

41:19.479 --> 41:20.543
Seconds, right?

41:20.578 --> 41:21.561
Uh, yeah, if you count from

41:21.596 --> 41:23.253
When I came in the door.

41:23.288 --> 41:24.875
OK, tell you what. Let me

41:24.910 --> 41:26.777
Have a sandwich, and then wait

41:26.812 --> 41:27.544
A couple minutes. I'll be

41:27.579 --> 41:28.643
Ready to go again.

41:28.678 --> 41:30.861
Hmm, OK.

41:30.896 --> 41:33.009
OK, oh...

41:33.044 --> 41:36.277
OK. You, uh, want something

41:36.312 --> 41:38.811
To eat?

41:38.846 --> 41:41.311
Um...

41:43.478 --> 41:44.511
I'm gonna go in the bedroom

41:44.546 --> 41:45.861
And see if you have any

41:45.896 --> 41:47.177
Candles or something.

41:51.777 --> 41:53.460
Oh... love what you've

41:53.495 --> 41:55.109
Done with the place.

41:55.144 --> 41:57.410
Um, why don't you, why don't

41:57.445 --> 41:58.978
You come back out to the couch.

41:59.013 --> 42:00.511
You change your mind about

42:00.546 --> 42:01.242
That sandwich?

42:01.277 --> 42:02.377
Yeah, yeah. I think I'm

42:02.412 --> 42:03.478
Ready to go again. Come out

42:03.513 --> 42:04.509
Here.

42:04.544 --> 42:05.509
Come on, Tommy.

42:05.544 --> 42:06.794
I think the sheets, actually,

42:06.829 --> 42:08.044
Haven't been cleaned in awhile,

42:08.079 --> 42:08.909
So...

42:08.944 --> 42:10.777
don't be sh...

42:10.812 --> 42:12.742
come on.

42:12.777 --> 42:14.827
Oh, this is about Janet.

42:14.862 --> 42:16.842
It's not about Janet.

42:16.877 --> 42:20.643
This is your bedroom. Oh.

42:20.678 --> 42:22.543
What?

42:22.578 --> 42:23.942
Hey, stud.

42:23.977 --> 42:26.510
Is that Janet?

42:26.545 --> 42:29.009
Is that angie?

42:29.044 --> 42:31.544
Oh, the moment is complete.

42:31.579 --> 42:34.009
She's got a lot of stuff

42:34.044 --> 42:35.194
That she left here that she's,

42:35.229 --> 42:36.344
You know, still comes to pick

42:36.379 --> 42:37.643
Up sometimes. So she's

42:37.678 --> 42:39.009
Probably...

42:39.044 --> 42:41.927
like maybe... pick up a dress.

42:41.962 --> 42:44.253
And you said you admired me,

42:44.288 --> 42:46.032
Janet. I really admire you.

42:46.067 --> 42:47.777
You're a regular mother teresa,

42:47.812 --> 42:49.409
I'll tell you.

42:49.444 --> 42:51.244
Both Tommy and Johnny. This one

42:51.279 --> 42:53.261
Can't screw. Other one can't

42:53.296 --> 42:55.103
Laugh. And yet you find the

42:55.138 --> 42:56.674
Time in your day to spread

42:56.709 --> 42:58.476
Your legs for both of them.

42:58.511 --> 43:00.244
Modern day mother teresa,

43:00.279 --> 43:01.211
I'm telling you.

43:01.246 --> 43:02.109
It's been real.

43:02.144 --> 43:04.027
Not this asshole again.

43:04.062 --> 43:06.619
Angie, please, wait. Angie.

43:06.654 --> 43:09.142
Another Gavin asshole!

43:09.177 --> 43:10.511
Yeah, OK. Yeah, everybody's

43:10.546 --> 43:11.411
All right. Don't worry

43:11.446 --> 43:12.242
About it, OK?

43:12.277 --> 43:13.111
I'm gonna kick your ass,

43:13.146 --> 43:13.928
Scarecrow.

43:13.963 --> 43:14.710
Oh, really?

43:14.745 --> 43:15.777
Yeah.

43:21.877 --> 43:23.110
Little too rich for your

43:23.145 --> 43:24.527
Blood, huh, Tommy? Huh?

43:24.562 --> 43:25.875
Take a good look, OK?

43:25.910 --> 43:27.893
Or remember me the way it was

43:27.928 --> 43:29.469
In your mom's backyard, huh?

43:29.504 --> 43:31.207
Hanging out in my sweater,

43:31.242 --> 43:32.609
Just looking so sexy. And I'm

43:32.644 --> 43:33.977
Gonna remember you the way that

43:34.012 --> 43:35.311
You are right now. Laying on

43:35.346 --> 43:36.695
The floor like a piece

43:36.730 --> 43:38.044
Of garbage that you are.

43:46.478 --> 43:48.161
Honey, how about a hand, huh?

43:48.196 --> 43:49.736
You've got to be kidding me.

43:49.771 --> 43:51.277
What about what you said

43:51.312 --> 43:52.608
Inside before?

43:52.643 --> 43:54.510
That was for her benefit.

43:54.545 --> 43:56.377
So how do you really feel?

43:56.412 --> 43:57.910
Ridiculous.

43:58.305 --> 44:04.585
