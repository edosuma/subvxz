[dramatic old-timey music]

02:49.673 --> 02:50.631
[car engine roaring]

02:50.631 --> 02:51.589
- [Watson] Are you gonna let Lestrade

02:51.589 --> 02:53.115
handle this thing by himself?

02:53.115 --> 02:53.948
- [Sherlock] Well, after all,

02:53.948 --> 02:55.619
he does represent the
official police, you know.

02:55.619 --> 02:57.285
- [Watson] With him doing the questioning,

02:57.285 --> 02:59.132
looking under the seat
cushions for diamonds,

02:59.132 --> 03:01.565
what very more must we do now?

03:01.565 --> 03:02.844
I could do it better myself.

03:02.844 --> 03:04.009
- [Sherlock] Why don't you, old fellow?

03:04.009 --> 03:05.470
- [Watson] Huh?

03:05.470 --> 03:07.209
By Jove, I think I will.

03:07.209 --> 03:10.136
Probably find out just as
much Lestrade would anyway.

03:10.136 --> 03:12.145
I'll do it at once.

03:12.145 --> 03:15.062
Oh, that's where we just came from.

03:17.439 --> 03:19.022
Locked, huh?

03:19.022 --> 03:19.855
Oh.

03:24.863 --> 03:27.200
Well, I'll start with this one.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.450
[knocking]

03:30.744 --> 03:31.627
Hello.

03:31.627 --> 03:32.460
- [Man] Yes?

03:32.460 --> 03:34.924
- [Watson] My name's Watson. Dr. Watson.

03:34.924 --> 03:38.106
- [Man] Oh, to what am I
indebted to this intrusion?

03:38.106 --> 03:38.939
- [Watson] I'm afraid

03:38.939 --> 03:40.399
I've got to ask you one or two questions.

03:40.399 --> 03:41.933
What are you doing on the train?

03:41.933 --> 03:42.781
Where are you going?

03:42.781 --> 03:43.772
Things like that, you know.

03:43.772 --> 03:46.258
- [Man] Why? Customary?

03:46.258 --> 03:49.605
- [Watson] Oh, there's
been a murder committed.

03:49.605 --> 03:50.924
Scotland Yard.

03:50.924 --> 03:52.585
- Did my food come?

03:52.585 --> 03:54.743
- It's in the kitchen.

03:54.743 --> 03:57.203
- [Man On Radio] What
about Sherlock Holmes?

03:57.203 --> 03:58.758
- [Watson] We're cross-examining suspects.

03:58.758 --> 03:59.928
- Thanks for that.

03:59.928 --> 04:01.261
- [Man On Radio] Suspects?

04:01.261 --> 04:03.038
Of what am I suspected?

04:03.038 --> 04:06.081
- [Watson] Oh, a fellow's
dead. Murdered, you know.

04:06.081 --> 04:08.451
- [Man On Radio] Now,
let me get this straight.

04:08.451 --> 04:10.548
You say a murder has been
committed on this train?

04:10.548 --> 04:11.860
- [Watson] Oh, in the next compartment.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.502
- [Man On Radio] And because
a perfect stranger to me

04:13.502 --> 04:15.994
got himself murdered,
you've come to question me?

04:15.994 --> 04:18.076
- [Watson] Well, we've
got to question everybody!

04:18.076 --> 04:20.733
- [Man On Radio] Are you a policeman? No?

04:20.733 --> 04:22.011
Then by what right

04:22.011 --> 04:24.130
do you force your way into my compartment?

04:24.130 --> 04:29.130

05:28.015 --> 05:29.937
- [Meeks] If you need anything, just call.

05:29.937 --> 05:31.520
- [Anna] Thank you.

05:33.962 --> 05:36.545

[window creaking]

05:57.186 --> 05:59.238
[car engine roaring]

05:59.238 --> 06:01.988
- [Sherlock] Excuse us, will you?

06:08.621 --> 06:10.224
- [Lestrade] What's the idea, Mr. Holmes?

06:10.224 --> 06:11.791
- [Sherlock] It's a
matter of taste, Lestrade.

06:11.791 --> 06:15.375
The young lady's taking her
mother to Scotland for burial.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.045
- [Lestrade] In a coffin?

06:17.045 --> 06:19.646
- [Sherlock] That is the
customary method, I believe.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.652
Lestrade, I think we'll
take a look at that coffin.

06:21.652 --> 06:23.272
It might prove interesting.

06:23.272 --> 06:24.651
- [Lestrade] Hm, I was about to

06:24.651 --> 06:27.045
suggest that very thing
myself, Mr. Holmes.

06:27.045 --> 06:29.014
Conductor, I'll have a
look in the luggage van.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.681
- [Conductor] Oh, this way, sir.

06:46.528 --> 06:47.695
- [Mum] Hello.

06:48.661 --> 06:50.300
Are you there yet, love?

06:50.300 --> 06:51.158
- Yes, Mum.

06:51.158 --> 06:53.497
- [Mum] And? What's it like?

06:53.497 --> 06:55.471
- Well, I've barely put my bags down.

06:55.471 --> 06:57.679
- [Mum] Is it as good as
it looks in the brochure?

06:57.679 --> 06:59.403
- [Anna] I'm just in the door.

06:59.403 --> 07:01.581
- [Mum] It looked lovely in the brochure.

07:01.581 --> 07:04.339
Oh, just give me a sec, love.

07:04.339 --> 07:06.221
I just got to answer the door.

07:06.221 --> 07:08.804
[tender music]

07:13.485 --> 07:16.260
Sorry, love. That was
just a package for Dad.

07:16.260 --> 07:18.267
So, what's the impression?

07:18.267 --> 07:22.823
- [Anna] So far, so good. I'll
call you later and report.

07:22.823 --> 07:24.335
- [Mum] Do. Do, love, do.

07:24.335 --> 07:26.638
Your dad will want the complete lowdown.

07:26.638 --> 07:28.351
- Of course, Mum.

07:28.351 --> 07:31.036
Let me get settled and
I'll call you as soon as.

07:31.036 --> 07:32.714
- [Mum] Okay, okay, love.

07:32.714 --> 07:34.264
Dad sends kisses.

07:34.264 --> 07:36.752
- [Anna] Yeah, kisses back. Love you.

07:36.752 --> 07:40.298
- [Mum] Love you. Love you, sweetheart.

12:54.167 --> 12:56.872
- [Dad] I'll keep it short, Squirrel.

12:56.872 --> 12:57.705
- Hi, Dad.

12:59.088 --> 13:01.816
- [Dad] Well, will it do?

13:01.816 --> 13:03.581
- It's perfect, Dad.

13:03.581 --> 13:07.403
Oh, guess what? I am the
first person to stay here.

13:07.403 --> 13:09.070
It's been renovated.

13:10.593 --> 13:13.010
- [Dad] Excellent, excellent.

13:14.308 --> 13:15.865
Book 5, love!

13:15.865 --> 13:19.217
- [Anna] It's ﬁne, Dad. It'll come.

13:19.217 --> 13:20.681
It always does.

13:20.681 --> 13:22.859
I just need a couple of days cooling off

13:22.859 --> 13:25.334
and I'll be able to jump right in.

13:25.334 --> 13:27.658
- [Dad] That's my girl.

13:27.658 --> 13:29.497
Well, Sophie in the
Book Corner told me that

13:29.497 --> 13:32.664
books 1 to 3 have completely sold out.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.465
They have another lot on order.

13:36.465 --> 13:38.423
- [Anna] Sophie's lovely.

13:38.423 --> 13:40.082
Tell her thanks from me,

13:40.082 --> 13:43.144
for keeping the flag flying.

13:43.144 --> 13:45.745
- [Dad] I know you're
being kind, Squirrel.

13:45.745 --> 13:48.720
She is aware it's only a village bookshop,

13:48.720 --> 13:52.290
but we're proud of you, that's all.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.419
No one else from this
quaint corner of the world

13:54.419 --> 13:57.263
has ascended to such dizzy heights.

13:57.263 --> 14:00.240
- [Anna] I'm not exactly
J.K. Rowling, Dad.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.332
- Well, she wasn't either,
until Hollywood came calling.

14:03.332 --> 14:06.391
- [Anna] I think you'll find
she's always been J.K. Rowling.

14:06.391 --> 14:09.230
- [Dad] You know what I mean.

14:09.230 --> 14:12.147
Look, your old dad is proud of you.

14:14.138 --> 14:16.033
You are following what burns inside

14:16.033 --> 14:17.757
and making a bloody good living,

14:17.757 --> 14:19.496
so you keep that fire lit.

14:19.496 --> 14:22.178
- [Anna] Thanks, Dad. That
means the world to me.

14:22.178 --> 14:23.824
You know it does.

14:23.824 --> 14:25.584
Now stop worrying.

14:25.584 --> 14:27.009
- [Dad] I know. I know.

14:27.009 --> 14:28.592
I just, um, well...

14:30.170 --> 14:34.496
I just don't like to think of
you being unhappy, that's all.

14:34.496 --> 14:36.024
It breaks my heart.

14:36.024 --> 14:39.774
- [Anna] Stop, Dad.
You'll make me cry again.

14:40.868 --> 14:44.496
It'll get sorted, one way or the other.

14:44.496 --> 14:46.579
- [Dad] Okay. Okay, love.

14:47.691 --> 14:51.417
Well, you enjoy your night
and keep me in the loop.

14:51.417 --> 14:54.514
We'll talk tomorrow, or the day after.

14:54.514 --> 14:56.643
- [Anna] Of course, Dad.

14:56.643 --> 14:57.976
Dad, I love you.

15:00.514 --> 15:03.314
- [Dad] And I love you too, Squirrel.

[fire crackling]

15:26.427 --> 15:29.260
[old-timey music]

15:33.808 --> 15:34.808
- Very well.

15:35.644 --> 15:38.915
Our guests are here,
unfortunately still alive.

15:38.915 --> 15:40.583
Is your face on yet?

15:44.082 --> 15:47.807
- Dust and dirt everywhere.
The water barely trickled.

15:47.807 --> 15:49.655
Couldn't you have had the place cleaned?

15:49.655 --> 15:51.544
- Atmosphere, darling.
You know how ghosts are.

15:51.544 --> 15:53.127
They never tidy up.

15:54.249 --> 15:55.943
That's a very fetching outfit,

15:55.943 --> 15:57.759
but hardly suitable for a party.

15:57.759 --> 15:59.845
- I'm not going to the party.

15:59.845 --> 16:02.743
- This spend-the-night ghost
party was your idea, remember?

16:02.743 --> 16:06.607
If you're gonna cost me
$50,000, I want you to have fun.

16:06.607 --> 16:10.558
- The party was my idea, until
you invited all the guests.

16:10.558 --> 16:13.357
Why all of these strangers,
but none of our friends?

16:13.357 --> 16:16.268
- Friends? Do we have any friends?

16:16.268 --> 16:19.219
- No, your jealousy took care of that.

16:19.219 --> 16:22.135
- I had a reason for inviting each guest.

16:22.135 --> 16:24.523
I wanted kind of a cross section,

16:24.523 --> 16:26.856
from psychiatrist to typist,

16:27.762 --> 16:30.550
and from drunk to jet pilot.

16:30.550 --> 16:34.116
They share one thing, they all need money.

16:34.116 --> 16:37.653
Now, let's see if they're
brave enough to earn it.

16:37.653 --> 16:39.891
- [Woman] And you call this a party?

16:39.891 --> 16:41.308
- [Man] Could be.

16:45.390 --> 16:46.407
- [Woman] Why do you always do that?

16:46.407 --> 16:48.248
It spoils the Champagne.

16:48.248 --> 16:50.100
- [Man] Well, it might explode.

16:50.100 --> 16:52.921
- [Woman] It never does.

16:52.921 --> 16:55.198
- [Man] Will you guarantee that?

16:55.198 --> 16:57.049
- [Woman] That isn't funny, Frederick.

16:57.049 --> 16:58.460
- [Frederick] It would
make a good headline.

16:58.460 --> 17:02.112

[ominous music]

17:59.374 --> 18:00.935
- [Man] Where did it come from?

[somber violin music]

19:22.724 --> 19:24.305
- [Radio] "Aesop's Fables,"

19:24.305 --> 19:27.207
A New Translation by V. S. Vernon Jones,

19:27.207 --> 19:31.790
with an introduction by G.
K. Chesterton, 1912 edition.

19:33.347 --> 19:34.391
Introduction.

19:34.391 --> 19:36.483
[ominous music]

19:36.483 --> 19:41.036
Aesop embodies an epigram not
uncommon in human history;

19:41.036 --> 19:42.937
his fame is all the more deserved

19:42.937 --> 19:45.325
because he never deserved it.

19:45.325 --> 19:47.801
The firm foundations of common sense,

19:47.801 --> 19:50.012
the shrewd shots at uncommon sense,

19:50.012 --> 19:52.211
that characterize all his fables,

19:52.211 --> 19:55.383
belong not him but to humanity.

19:55.383 --> 19:57.103
In the earliest human history,

19:57.103 --> 20:00.066
whatever is authentic is universal,

20:00.066 --> 20:03.483
and whatever is universal is anonymous.

20:03.483 --> 20:06.675
In such cases, there is
always some central man

20:06.675 --> 20:09.154
who had first the trouble
of collecting them,

20:09.154 --> 20:11.831
and afterwards the fame of creating them.

20:11.831 --> 20:16.002
He had the fame; and, on the
whole, he earned the fame.

20:16.002 --> 20:18.543
There must be something great and human,

20:18.543 --> 20:21.119
something of the human
future and the human past,

20:21.119 --> 20:24.174
in such a man, even if he only used it

20:24.174 --> 20:27.457
to rob the past or deceive the future.

20:27.457 --> 20:30.892
The story of Arthur may
have been really connected

20:30.892 --> 20:34.155
with the most fighting

21:50.163 --> 21:53.788
even those imposing annual
ceremonies cold and lifeless.

21:53.788 --> 21:56.177
To you, at least of those present,

21:56.177 --> 21:57.196
they should have the
solemnity of an ordinance,

21:57.196 --> 21:58.487
[phone buzzes]

21:58.487 --> 22:00.804
called as you are this
day to a high dignity

22:00.804 --> 22:03.665
and to so weighty an office and charge.

22:03.665 --> 22:05.513
You have chosen your Genius,

22:05.513 --> 22:07.923
have passed beneath the
Throne of Necessity,

22:07.923 --> 22:11.312
and with the voices of the fatal
sisters still in your ears,

22:11.312 --> 22:13.876
will soon enter the plain of Forgetfulness

22:13.876 --> 22:16.774
and drink of the waters of its river.

22:16.774 --> 22:18.580
Ere you are driven all manner of ways,

22:18.580 --> 22:21.705

22:27.654 --> 22:30.487
It is my duty to say a
few words of encouragement

22:30.487 --> 22:33.536
and to bid you, in the
name of the Faculty,

22:33.536 --> 22:36.451
God-speed on your journey.

22:36.451 --> 22:38.593
I could have the heart to spare you,

22:38.593 --> 22:41.581
poor, careworn survivors
of a hard struggle,

22:41.581 --> 22:44.931
so "lean and pale and
leaden-eyed with study;"

22:44.931 --> 22:47.229
and my tender mercy
constrains me to consider

22:47.229 --> 22:49.492
but two of the score of elements

22:49.492 --> 22:52.017
which may make or mar your lives,

22:52.017 --> 22:54.743
which may contribute to your success,

22:54.743 --> 22:55.729
or help you in the days of failure.

22:55.729 --> 22:58.265
[phone buzzes]

22:58.265 --> 23:00.891
In the first place, in
the physician or surgeon

23:00.891 --> 23:04.303
no quality takes rank
with imperturbability,

23:04.303 --> 23:06.878
and I propose for a few minutes
to direct your attention

23:06.878 --> 23:08.478
to this essential bodily virtue.

23:08.478 --> 23:09.925
[creaking]

23:09.925 --> 23:12.430
Perhaps I may be able
to give those of you,

23:12.430 --> 23:13.655
in whom it has not developed

23:13.655 --> 23:16.492
during the critical
scenes of the past month,

23:16.492 --> 23:18.794
a hint or two of its importance,

23:18.794 --> 23:22.368
possibly a suggestion for its attainment.

23:22.368 --> 23:25.192
Imperturbability means
coolness and presence of mind

23:25.192 --> 23:29.279
under all circumstances,
calmness amid storm,

23:29.279 --> 23:32.479
clearness of judgment in
moments of grave peril,

23:32.479 --> 23:35.778
immobility, impassiveness, or,

23:35.778 --> 23:38.953
to use an old and expressive word, phlegm.

23:38.953 --> 23:40.569
It is the quality which is
most appreciated by the laity,

23:40.569 --> 23:41.934
[creaking]

23:41.934 --> 23:44.322
though often misunderstood by them;

23:44.322 --> 23:47.407
and the physician who has the
misfortune to be without it,

23:47.407 --> 23:49.998
who betrays indecision and worry,

23:49.998 --> 23:51.934
and who shows that he is
flustered and flurried

23:51.934 --> 23:53.830
in ordinary emergencies,

23:53.830 --> 23:57.534
loses rapidly the
confidence of his patients.

23:57.534 --> 23:58.912
In full development,

23:58.912 --> 24:01.697
as we see it in some of
our older colleagues,

24:01.697 --> 24:04.162
it has the nature of a divine gift,

24:04.162 --> 24:06.220
a blessing to the possessor,

24:06.220 --> 24:09.655
a comfort to all who
come in contact with him.

24:09.655 --> 24:11.510
You should know it well, for
there have been before you

24:11.510 --> 24:15.172
for years several striking
illustrations, whose example has,

24:15.172 --> 24:17.839
I trust, made a deep impression.

24:18.685 --> 24:22.077
As imperturbability is
largely a bodily endowment,

24:22.077 --> 24:24.675
I regret to say that there
are those amongst you,

24:24.675 --> 24:26.594
who, owing to congenital defects,

24:26.594 --> 24:29.938
may never be able to acquire it.

24:29.938 --> 24:32.688
Education, however, will do much.

27:18.503 --> 27:20.767
- [David] Hey, how are things?

27:20.767 --> 27:23.101
- [Anna] I've only just arrived, David,

27:23.101 --> 27:25.383
and frankly, this is annoying.

27:25.383 --> 27:27.675
- [David] Look, I just
want you to know that

27:27.675 --> 27:29.383
I'm thinking about you.

27:29.383 --> 27:31.283
All the time, actually.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.482
- [Anna] Wow.

27:32.482 --> 27:34.170
- [David] Wow, what?

27:34.170 --> 27:37.655
- [Anna] That is some
reformation in 24 hours.

27:37.655 --> 27:40.578
- [David] I love you, Anna. You know that.

27:40.578 --> 27:42.688
I'm always thinking about you.

27:42.688 --> 27:44.896
- [Anna] And you were thinking of me

27:44.896 --> 27:45.979
when you had your tongue

27:45.979 --> 27:49.396
inside of Alison's mouth at your work do?

27:50.535 --> 27:52.493
- [David] We were drunk.

27:52.493 --> 27:55.068
I don't even particularly like Alison.

27:55.068 --> 27:56.068
- [Anna] Oh.

27:56.970 --> 27:58.726
Well, that's lovely.

27:58.726 --> 28:02.393
So, I can expect you
to grab the first woman

28:03.856 --> 28:06.006
on Oxford Street on a Saturday afternoon

28:06.006 --> 28:07.460
as we're out shopping.

28:07.460 --> 28:10.382
On a whim. On a compulsion.

28:10.382 --> 28:13.226
- [David] Don't be childish, Anna.

28:13.226 --> 28:14.881
Look, it's never happened before

28:14.881 --> 28:17.191
and it will never happen again.

28:17.191 --> 28:19.176
I'm sorry, for fuck's sake.

28:22.514 --> 28:24.355

28:24.355 --> 28:26.772
"I'm sorry, for fuck's sake."

28:28.256 --> 28:29.256
Look, David.

28:30.770 --> 28:35.187
I appreciate you thinking
of me and making an effort,

28:37.854 --> 28:38.771
but I need,

28:40.293 --> 28:41.126
yes, me,

28:42.270 --> 28:44.129
I need time alone here

28:44.129 --> 28:48.219
to write the book that I am under contract

28:48.219 --> 28:49.802
to deliver on time,

28:51.581 --> 28:54.823
and now, figure everything out.

28:54.823 --> 28:56.764
- [David] I understand that, but-

28:56.764 --> 29:00.851
- [Anna] Please, David. I
hear what you are saying.

29:00.851 --> 29:04.101
I take it on board and I appreciate it,

29:06.015 --> 29:08.314
but it would mean so much more

29:08.314 --> 29:12.231
if you respect my need
to have this time alone.

29:13.315 --> 29:15.003
Can you do that for me?

29:15.003 --> 29:16.670
- [David] Yes, Anna.

29:17.684 --> 29:19.350
I can do that.

- [Stephen] Settled in?

29:41.193 --> 29:42.644
- [Anna] It's wonderful.

29:42.644 --> 29:44.599
- [Stephen] So, what's our plan?

29:44.599 --> 29:46.557
- [Anna] The first
three chapters delivery,

29:46.557 --> 29:48.191
as soon as possible.

29:48.191 --> 29:50.204
- [Stephen] Absolutely. Full chapters.

29:50.204 --> 29:51.910
As close to finished as possible.

29:51.910 --> 29:54.324
Outside editorial suggestion, of course.

29:54.324 --> 29:55.467
- [Anna] I'm on it, Stephen.

29:55.467 --> 29:58.578
I won't let you down. Do I ever?

29:58.578 --> 30:02.928
- [Stephen] It has been close
to the wire, several times,

30:02.928 --> 30:04.416
but today is a new day

30:04.416 --> 30:06.178

a fresh perspective.

30:06.178 --> 30:07.306
Am I wrong?

30:07.306 --> 30:09.898
- [Anna] You're not wrong, Stephen.

30:09.898 --> 30:11.349
I've already made a start.

30:11.349 --> 30:12.589
- [Stephen] You know
the terms of the advance

30:12.589 --> 30:14.076
and the contractual stipulation

30:14.076 --> 30:16.908
to deliver chapters to deadline,

30:16.908 --> 30:18.757
so I will leave you to
your sterling efforts.

30:18.757 --> 30:22.174
- [Anna] Thank you, Stephen.
I'll be in touch soon.

- [Anna] Voices.

34:36.617 --> 34:39.967

34:39.967 --> 34:41.783

34:41.783 --> 34:44.130
Because you were guaranteed a visitation

34:46.311 --> 34:47.389

- [Anna] No buts.

36:35.829 --> 36:38.131
we're not here to harm you.

36:38.131 --> 36:40.330
I just want to talk briefly.

36:40.330 --> 36:42.691
- Well, I'd like to know
more about you first.

36:42.691 --> 36:43.631
- [Interviewer] Well, of course, Jimmy.

36:43.631 --> 36:46.582

36:53.017 --> 36:54.850
tell us where you are?

36:55.693 --> 36:56.810
- Oh, absolutely.

36:56.810 --> 36:58.830
- [Interviewer] And so?

36:58.830 --> 37:00.725
- You mean you don't know where you are?

37:00.725 --> 37:02.551
- [Interviewer] No, of course, Jimmy.

37:02.551 --> 37:04.702
I just want to hear it from you.

37:04.702 --> 37:07.725
- Why, Fiddleston, of course.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.543
- [Interviewer] Yes, Jimmy.

37:09.543 --> 37:12.930
- You lot have come a long way.

37:12.930 --> 37:14.426
- [Interviewer] Do you mind, um,

37:14.426 --> 37:16.378
can I ask your full name?

37:16.378 --> 37:17.772
- Go on then.

37:17.772 --> 37:20.017

37:33.751 --> 37:35.883
- [Interviewer] Am I?

37:35.883 --> 37:38.088
- Tell me, what's this about?

37:38.088 --> 37:42.632
- [Interviewer] Well, this may
seem like a strange question,

37:42.632 --> 37:45.372
but I need to ask you
to please play along.

37:45.372 --> 37:46.539

- I've got to get home
soon. You should too.

38:06.392 --> 38:09.309
[muffled speaking]

38:13.206 --> 38:17.123
- [Interviewer] That's
a very wise move, Jimmy.

38:17.964 --> 38:19.724
- What's that over there?

38:19.724 --> 38:20.807
To your left.

- [Anna] Emma Hart, June 8th, 1939.

52:59.185 --> 53:01.630
When Emma pulled back the curtains,

53:01.630 --> 53:02.851
she noticed that the tall figure,

53:02.851 --> 53:03.684
[keyboard clacking]

53:03.684 --> 53:06.105
now an inky black
silhouette on the horizon

53:06.105 --> 53:08.030
near the Low Wood Copse,

53:08.030 --> 53:11.780
was tilted in the
direction of the farmhouse.

53:12.842 --> 53:16.729
It seemed taller than
before, even though hers

53:16.729 --> 53:19.930
wasn't a reliable vantage
point from the window.

53:19.930 --> 53:23.035
She remembered having thought a great wolf

53:23.035 --> 53:25.480
was running the length of the hilltop

53:25.480 --> 53:27.790
when she visited her aunt
and uncle at the farmhouse

53:27.790 --> 53:31.606
while in her early teens,
only to discover...

53:31.606 --> 53:33.856
[clicking]

53:39.616 --> 53:43.163
That it was an errant
sheepdog hunting rabbits.

53:43.163 --> 53:46.511
It was Farmer Stillgoe's
sheepdog, in fact,

53:46.511 --> 53:50.594
but that was a whole other
mystery, since solved.

53:52.041 --> 53:53.557
Emma closed the curtains

53:53.557 --> 53:56.460
with as much nonchalance
as she could muster,

53:56.460 --> 54:00.105
under the circumstances, and
walked quickly to the stairs

54:00.105 --> 54:02.363
that led to the upper floors.

54:02.363 --> 54:05.120
She bounded them, three steps at a time,

54:05.120 --> 54:07.480
and when the first landing was reached,

54:07.480 --> 54:09.150
she made her way to the small window

54:09.150 --> 54:13.983
at the center of the house for
a better look at the ridge.

54:29.458 --> 54:31.799
The light was failing fast though,

54:31.799 --> 54:34.784
and she knew instinctively
that there wasn't much hope

54:34.784 --> 54:36.624
of seeing more than from below,

54:36.624 --> 54:40.395
but she had some time before
dinner with her extended family

54:40.395 --> 54:44.156
and so, being true to
her inquisitive nature,

54:44.156 --> 54:47.800
she peered out into the growing gloom.

54:47.800 --> 54:50.383
[gentle music]

54:52.260 --> 54:54.150
- [Mum] I wouldn't call
it a fender-bender,

54:54.150 --> 54:57.158
but there is a sizeable
dent in the passenger door.

54:57.158 --> 54:58.791
- [Anna] Did Dad go mad?

54:58.791 --> 55:02.375
- [Mum] No, no, actually, surprisingly.

55:02.375 --> 55:05.082
He was quite philosophical about it.

55:05.082 --> 55:07.092
He accepted that it wasn't my fault

55:07.092 --> 55:09.765
and that the other driver was backing out.

55:09.765 --> 55:10.682
Refreshing.

55:11.975 --> 55:14.091
Look, he's hovering now.

55:14.091 --> 55:15.139
I'll put him on.

55:15.139 --> 55:16.461
- [Anna] Kisses, Mum.

55:16.461 --> 55:19.461
- [Mum] Love and kisses, sweetheart.

55:20.421 --> 55:22.193
- [Dad] Have you Googled it yet?

55:22.193 --> 55:24.924
- [Anna] Are you psychic, Dad?

55:24.924 --> 55:27.011
- [Dad] Perhaps. A little.

55:27.011 --> 55:28.104
- [Anna] I nearly did,

55:28.104 --> 55:30.513
but I can't get distracted from the work.

55:30.513 --> 55:33.719
Just too many Draconian conditions.

55:33.719 --> 55:36.841
- [Dad] If I was there, I
wouldn't be able to resist it,

55:36.841 --> 55:38.882
and you know what your
dear old mum always says.

55:38.882 --> 55:41.109
- [Anna] I'm a chip off the old block?

55:41.109 --> 55:44.359
- [Dad] Yes, me. The father, the elder.

55:47.652 --> 55:49.990
- [Anna] The work is going great.

55:49.990 --> 55:51.587
I'm just hoping things quiet down

55:51.587 --> 55:53.420
and I can keep up the pace.

55:53.420 --> 55:55.368
Increase it, even.

55:55.368 --> 55:56.790
- [Dad] Okay, love.

that the work is ﬂowing.

1:00:00.701 --> 1:00:03.627
into a sea-going career of his own.

1:00:03.627 --> 1:00:06.191
He was successful, and by the age of 29,

1:00:06.191 --> 1:00:09.933
was a captain of his own
vessel, The Noble Margaret.

1:00:09.933 --> 1:00:13.119
By the age of 31, he was
settled in Seaview House

1:00:13.119 --> 1:00:15.034
with his young wife, Winifred,

1:00:15.034 --> 1:00:18.600
a devoutly religious woman
who held many intensive vigils

1:00:18.600 --> 1:00:22.465
for when her husband and crew were at sea.

1:00:22.465 --> 1:00:25.066
20 years of happiness was theirs,

1:00:25.066 --> 1:00:26.554
even though Winifred had suffered

1:00:26.554 --> 1:00:28.560
several episodes of mental illness

1:00:28.560 --> 1:00:30.956
which saw her taking sanitarium rest

1:00:30.956 --> 1:00:33.631
on three of these occasions.

1:00:33.631 --> 1:00:37.808
Always coming through these
times of strain and infirmity,

1:00:37.808 --> 1:00:40.825
Winifred Meeks would be
back by her husband's side

1:00:40.825 --> 1:00:43.796
and preparing her
schedule of devout prayer

1:00:43.796 --> 1:00:48.044
as he set off for the
North Sea once again.

1:00:48.044 --> 1:00:51.544
In the particularly stormy spring of 1927,

1:00:52.561 --> 1:00:57.561
Captain Meeks and his crew
set off, never to return.

1:00:57.709 --> 1:01:00.869
The locality was devastated by this loss,

1:01:00.869 --> 1:01:05.062
as many had husbands and
sons crewing the vessel

1:01:05.062 --> 1:01:07.529
and it wasn't long before Winifred Meeks

1:01:07.529 --> 1:01:09.745
and her own private determinations

1:01:09.745 --> 1:01:13.996
to pray for her husband's
safe return was forgotten.

1:01:13.996 --> 1:01:15.406
Winifred believed that

1:01:15.406 --> 1:01:18.073
if she scourged herself
with green branches

1:01:18.073 --> 1:01:21.130
and restricted her
intake of food and water,

1:01:21.130 --> 1:01:23.170
her personal suffering would strengthen

1:01:23.170 --> 1:01:27.035
her husband's resolve
to make it home to her.

1:01:27.035 --> 1:01:30.885
She continued to pray and
scourge and restrict her food

1:01:30.885 --> 1:01:34.569
until she eventually
succumbed to malnutrition.

1:01:34.569 --> 1:01:37.074
She was discovered, starved to death,

1:01:37.074 --> 1:01:38.691
in the attic room of the house,

1:01:38.691 --> 1:01:40.124
where she had built a shrine

1:01:40.124 --> 1:01:43.041
to her husband and his safe return.

1:01:44.124 --> 1:01:47.690
Several people over the years
have experienced sightings

1:01:47.690 --> 1:01:50.789
of the ghost of Winifred Meeks at Seaview

1:01:50.789 --> 1:01:53.677
and near the lighthouse where, in life,

1:01:53.677 --> 1:01:55.919
she had held other vigils.

1:01:55.919 --> 1:01:59.209
[ominous music]

1:01:59.209 --> 1:02:01.959
[mouse clicking]

1:02:25.694 --> 1:02:30.509
[tense music]
[crows cawing]

1:02:30.509 --> 1:02:33.176
[ominous music]

1:03:07.188 --> 1:03:12.188
[crows distantly cawing]
[somber music]

1:03:45.327 --> 1:03:47.994
[flies buzzing]

1:03:50.774 --> 1:03:53.274
[tense music]

1:03:55.047 --> 1:03:57.630
[wind howling]

1:04:00.523 --> 1:04:03.273
[waves crashing]

1:04:10.219 --> 1:04:12.012
[ominous music]

1:04:12.012 --> 1:04:14.679
[woman sobbing]

1:04:35.529 --> 1:04:38.112
[wind howling]

1:04:43.108 --> 1:04:48.108
[woman sobbing]
[suspenseful music]

1:05:03.310 --> 1:05:06.310
[ghostly whooshing]

1:05:18.344 --> 1:05:21.261
[ghostly ambiance]

1:05:31.405 --> 1:05:33.905
[tense music]

1:05:44.131 --> 1:05:48.288
[birds chirping]
[gentle music]

1:05:48.288 --> 1:05:51.371
- [Radio] Do you call having
an extra bed in your room,

1:05:51.371 --> 1:05:52.204
"roughing it," Parkins?

1:05:52.204 --> 1:05:53.980
[phone ringing]

1:05:53.980 --> 1:05:55.283
[water burbling]

1:05:55.283 --> 1:05:56.116
- Hi, Stephen.

1:05:56.116 --> 1:05:57.704
- [Radio] I think I'll
occupy it for a bit.

1:05:57.704 --> 1:06:00.040
It'll be company for you.

1:06:00.040 --> 1:06:02.772
- [Stephen] Something for me?

1:06:02.772 --> 1:06:05.897
- Three chapters finished. Almost.

1:06:05.897 --> 1:06:07.754
Emailing them over tomorrow.

1:06:07.754 --> 1:06:11.540
- [Stephen] Fantastic,
Anna. We're on track.

1:06:11.540 --> 1:06:13.730
Even if changes are suggested,

1:06:13.730 --> 1:06:16.863
we are delivering as promised
and agreed, contractually.

1:06:16.863 --> 1:06:18.794
- Well, a few bumps in the night here

1:06:18.794 --> 1:06:22.176
have inspired the creative
process on this one.

1:06:22.176 --> 1:06:24.693
- [Stephen] Not ghosts, Anna?

1:06:24.693 --> 1:06:25.526
- I'm...

1:06:26.542 --> 1:06:30.252
- [Stephen] Just do me a favor
and get some proper sleep.

1:06:30.252 --> 1:06:32.727
Don't let your imagination
run into fantastical arenas

1:06:32.727 --> 1:06:34.244
that affect your real-life abilities

1:06:34.244 --> 1:06:37.533
to separate fact from fiction.

1:06:37.533 --> 1:06:40.042
- [Anna] Of course, Stephen.

1:06:40.042 --> 1:06:41.781
- [Stephen] We must deliver.

1:06:41.781 --> 1:06:44.148
- [Anna] I will email you tomorrow.

1:06:44.148 --> 1:06:45.898
Have a great evening.

1:06:47.489 --> 1:06:52.375
[wind chimes jingling]
[phone beeps]

1:06:52.375 --> 1:06:57.375
[wind howling]
[somber music]

1:06:59.307 --> 1:07:02.057
[birds chirping]

1:07:03.840 --> 1:07:04.785
- [Radio] Take a look,

1:07:04.785 --> 1:07:06.471
there will be light enough for that,

1:07:06.471 --> 1:07:08.393
at the ruins of which Disney was talking.

1:07:08.393 --> 1:07:09.264
[keyboard clacking]

1:07:09.264 --> 1:07:11.504
I don't exactly know where
they are, by the way,

1:07:11.504 --> 1:07:15.022
but I expect I can hardly
help stumbling on them.

1:07:15.022 --> 1:07:19.277
This he accomplished, I may
say, in the most literal sense,

1:07:19.277 --> 1:07:22.949
for in picking his way from
the links to the shingle beach,

1:07:22.949 --> 1:07:26.067
his foot caught, partly in a gorse-root

1:07:26.067 --> 1:07:30.560
and partly in a biggish
stone, and over he went.

1:07:30.560 --> 1:07:33.565
When he got up and
surveyed his surroundings,

1:07:33.565 --> 1:07:37.161
he found himself in a patch
of somewhat broken ground

1:07:37.161 --> 1:07:40.739
covered with small depressions and mounds.

1:07:40.739 --> 1:07:43.052
These latter, when he
came to examine them,

1:07:43.052 --> 1:07:45.698
proved to be simply masses of flints

1:07:45.698 --> 1:07:50.114
embedded in mortar and
grown over with turf.

1:07:50.114 --> 1:07:52.836
He must, he quite rightly concluded,

1:07:52.836 --> 1:07:57.671
be on the site of the preceptory
he had promised to look at.

1:07:57.671 --> 1:08:02.045
It seemed not unlikely to reward
the spade of the explorer;

1:08:02.045 --> 1:08:03.400
enough of the foundations

1:08:03.400 --> 1:08:05.768
was probably left at no great depth

1:08:05.768 --> 1:08:09.701
to throw a good deal of
light on the general plan.

1:08:09.701 --> 1:08:12.258
He remembered vaguely that the Templars,

1:08:12.258 --> 1:08:14.247
to whom this site had belonged,

1:08:14.247 --> 1:08:17.310
were in the habit of
building round churches,

1:08:17.310 --> 1:08:20.244
and he thought a particular
series of the humps or mounds

1:08:20.244 --> 1:08:22.740
near him did appear to be arranged

1:08:22.740 --> 1:08:25.805
in something of a circular form.

1:08:25.805 --> 1:08:28.053
Few people can resist the temptation

1:08:28.053 --> 1:08:30.468
to try a little amateur research

1:08:30.468 --> 1:08:33.481
in a department quite outside their own,

1:08:33.481 --> 1:08:34.990
if only for the
satisfaction of showing how-

1:08:34.990 --> 1:08:35.823
[radio crackling]

1:08:35.823 --> 1:08:38.490
[woman sobbing]

1:08:44.091 --> 1:08:46.758
[ominous music]

1:09:23.483 --> 1:09:28.483
[intense music]
[ghastly wailing]

1:09:28.544 --> 1:09:31.210
[woman sobbing]

1:09:35.871 --> 1:09:38.621
[woman laughing]

1:09:43.466 --> 1:09:46.749
The northern, a patch
of the turf was gone,

1:09:46.749 --> 1:09:49.774
removed by some boy or other
creature ferae naturae.

1:09:49.774 --> 1:09:51.794
[phone ringing]

1:09:51.794 --> 1:09:54.255
It might, he thought, be as well

1:09:54.255 --> 1:09:55.088
to probe the soil here

1:09:55.088 --> 1:09:56.155
[phone buzzes]

1:09:56.155 --> 1:09:58.243
for evidences of masonry,

1:09:58.243 --> 1:10:02.360
and he took out his knife and
began scraping away the earth.

1:10:02.360 --> 1:10:04.827
And now followed another little discovery.

1:10:04.827 --> 1:10:08.394
A portion of soil fell
inward as he scraped,

1:10:08.394 --> 1:10:11.365
and disclosed a small cavity.

1:10:11.365 --> 1:10:13.132
He lighted one match after another.

1:10:13.132 --> 1:10:18.132
[waves crashing]
[somber music]

1:10:24.107 --> 1:10:27.178
[birds chirping]

1:10:27.178 --> 1:10:28.380
- [Winifred] Anna?

1:10:28.380 --> 1:10:31.047
[ominous music]

1:10:53.871 --> 1:10:56.539

[suspenseful music]
[woman sobbing]

1:13:33.400 --> 1:13:34.233
- Please!

1:13:34.233 --> 1:13:36.800
Please! Please, leave me alone!

1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:37.634
Please!

1:13:37.634 --> 1:13:40.134
[tense music]

1:13:42.849 --> 1:13:45.318
Please leave me alone!

1:13:45.318 --> 1:13:47.152
Please leave me alone!

1:13:48.449 --> 1:13:50.224
Please leave me alone!

Please leave me alone!

1:13:59.593 --> 1:14:01.805
Please, leave me alone!

1:14:01.805 --> 1:14:03.348
Leave me alone!

1:14:03.348 --> 1:14:04.431
Leave me alone!

1:14:04.431 --> 1:14:05.294
Leave me alone!

1:14:05.294 --> 1:14:06.284
Leave me alone!

1:14:06.284 --> 1:14:08.564
Please leave me alone!

1:15:37.135 --> 1:15:38.552
Keep it together.

1:15:39.619 --> 1:15:40.452
This one.

1:15:44.014 --> 1:15:44.931
Okay, Anna.

1:15:46.924 --> 1:15:48.341
Keep it together.

Hello?

[faint singing in foreign language]

1:19:51.270 --> 1:19:52.634
- [Mum] Even a woman of your age,

1:19:52.634 --> 1:19:54.047
and especially with asthma,

1:19:54.047 --> 1:19:56.437
needs extra rest with pneumonia.

1:19:56.437 --> 1:19:58.020
- [Anna] I know, Mum.

1:19:58.020 --> 1:20:00.544
I'm getting more rest than I can handle.

1:20:00.544 --> 1:20:02.251
- [Mum] Oh, Dad's hovering, as usual.

1:20:02.251 --> 1:20:03.584
I'll put him on.

1:20:04.692 --> 1:20:05.967
See you tomorrow, love.

1:20:05.967 --> 1:20:08.612
Stay bundled up. Love you.

1:20:08.612 --> 1:20:11.130
- [Anna] I will. Love you.

1:20:11.130 --> 1:20:13.723
- [Dad] And how's my baby girl doing?

1:20:13.723 --> 1:20:16.321
- [Anna] She's not doing too badly, Dad.

1:20:16.321 --> 1:20:17.512
- [Dad] I know I keep saying it,

1:20:17.512 --> 1:20:20.603
but thank God for that
Seaview landlord finding you

1:20:20.603 --> 1:20:22.419
and calling an ambulance.

1:20:22.419 --> 1:20:23.866
- [Anna] I know, Dad.

1:20:23.866 --> 1:20:26.680
He's my knight in shining corduroy.

1:20:26.680 --> 1:20:27.733
- [Dad] But do you think

1:20:27.733 --> 1:20:29.923
the two weeks in hospital has been enough?

1:20:29.923 --> 1:20:31.073
I thought they wanted you

1:20:31.073 --> 1:20:32.939
to transfer to respite for a few weeks?

1:20:32.939 --> 1:20:36.764
- [Anna] And lie around all day
and night, eating shit food?

1:20:36.764 --> 1:20:38.682
No, Dad. Not happening.

1:20:39.517 --> 1:20:41.166
I want to be here, where I can have

1:20:41.166 --> 1:20:44.000
at least have some control anyway.

1:20:45.657 --> 1:20:48.755
- [Dad] All right, and David? All good?

1:20:48.755 --> 1:20:51.234
- [Anna] He's certainly
been making an effort.

1:20:51.234 --> 1:20:53.572
- [Dad] I'm glad to hear it, Squirrel.

1:20:53.572 --> 1:20:55.154
I do like David.

1:20:55.154 --> 1:20:56.769
- [Anna] I know you do, Dad.

1:20:56.769 --> 1:20:58.998
- [Dad] Well, must dash.

1:20:58.998 --> 1:21:00.276
Sleep tight, love.

1:21:00.276 --> 1:21:01.109
We'll see you tomorrow,

1:21:01.109 --> 1:21:05.549
and I'll bring you lots of
fruit and warm sentiment.

1:21:05.549 --> 1:21:06.732
- [Anna] I love you, Dad.

1:21:06.732 --> 1:21:08.655
- [Dad] And I love you too, Anna.

1:21:08.655 --> 1:21:10.280
I love you too.

[laptop beeps]

1:21:26.962 --> 1:21:28.289
- [Dr. Francis] Dear Ms. James,

1:21:28.289 --> 1:21:30.340
thank you for your email.

1:21:30.340 --> 1:21:33.749
Our studies of this property
and numerous investigations

1:21:33.749 --> 1:21:36.666
have shown that no one has
successfully lived at Seaview

1:21:36.666 --> 1:21:40.714
since the tragic deaths
of Captain and Mrs. Meeks.

1:21:40.714 --> 1:21:43.767
Various investigators
associated with our research,

1:21:43.767 --> 1:21:46.608
including members of the ordained clergy,

1:21:46.608 --> 1:21:49.023
have been unable to rid the house

1:21:49.023 --> 1:21:52.288
of the strong presence
there, but further attempts

1:21:52.288 --> 1:21:55.215
are already in the preparatory stages.

1:21:55.215 --> 1:21:57.638
I hope this has been of some help.

1:21:57.638 --> 1:22:01.168
I trust you are on the
road to a full recovery.

1:22:01.168 --> 1:22:03.701
Kind regards, Francis.

1:22:03.701 --> 1:22:07.067
