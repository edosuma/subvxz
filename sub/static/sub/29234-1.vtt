01:07.800 --> 01:09.166
 Olivia!

01:09.768 --> 01:12.505
 Catcha Foxx.

01:12.605 --> 01:14.505
 Sinnamon.

01:14.740 --> 01:16.807
 Lady of the Lake.

01:17.776 --> 01:18.842
 Fisticuffs.

01:19.912 --> 01:22.813
 Texas Red Tempest.

01:23.282 --> 01:24.815
 Bast.

01:26.285 --> 01:27.818
 Pressure Head.

02:26.979 --> 02:28.247
 How's Dad?

02:28.347 --> 02:30.414
 He's fine, a false alarm.

02:30.516 --> 02:32.583
Is that the hijab you're wearing?

02:33.352 --> 02:35.254
 Yeah, I love this one,
 it's pretty.

02:35.354 --> 02:37.590
 It's not supposed to
 be pretty, Fatima.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.425
 It's supposed to modestly
 remind your uncle

02:39.525 --> 02:41.760
 that his half-breed
 niece is devout.

02:41.860 --> 02:43.596
 Your father doesn't
 need any more stress.

02:43.696 --> 02:45.597
 Okay, okay,
 okay, I'm sorry.

02:45.697 --> 02:47.600
I'll, I'll just change it before
 we swing by the hospital.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.732
 Good girl.

02:50.769 --> 02:51.770
 You go on,

02:51.870 --> 02:52.871
 I'll meet you there, okay?

02:52.971 --> 02:54.004
 Okay.

03:14.860 --> 03:17.761
 Hey, girl, nice flower.

03:18.030 --> 03:19.298
 Give me your number.

03:19.398 --> 03:20.799
 Seriously, dude,

03:20.899 --> 03:22.050
 that's your A game?

03:22.150 --> 03:23.302
 Oh come on, you wouldn't
 be dressed like that

03:23.402 --> 03:24.769
 if you didn't want it.

03:24.869 --> 03:26.238
 Right, I put this
 whole outfit together

03:26.338 --> 03:27.773
 hoping to meet a loser
 at the bus stop.

03:27.873 --> 03:29.940
 That's what motivates my life.

03:30.909 --> 03:32.809
 Hey, my car's at the shop,
 all right?

03:34.046 --> 03:35.314
 Come here.

03:35.414 --> 03:36.782
 Back the fuck off!

03:36.882 --> 03:38.484
 What, I just think you
 look sexy, that's all.

03:38.584 --> 03:39.816
 Right.

03:46.592 --> 03:47.826
 I'm Fatima.

03:47.926 --> 03:49.495
 Texas Red Tempest.

03:49.595 --> 03:50.663
 Nice name.

03:50.763 --> 03:51.795
 Yours too.

03:52.898 --> 03:54.331
 What's it mean?

03:54.933 --> 03:58.502
 Um, captivating, I think.

03:58.937 --> 04:00.504
 I Googled it once.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.841
 And he's drunk.

04:02.941 --> 04:05.842
 Hey, hey, I got vertigo,
 all right?

04:06.945 --> 04:08.363
 Just-just give me your
 number, all right?

04:08.463 --> 04:09.980
 My friend's here now,
 I'm busy.

04:12.451 --> 04:14.253
 Fucking Muslims.

04:14.453 --> 04:15.686
 Bye!

04:20.557 --> 04:22.228
That was alarming.

04:22.628 --> 04:25.698
 Oh well, I can  handle it, usually.

04:25.798 --> 04:27.866
 Well, wouldn't it be easier

04:27.966 --> 04:31.704
 to dress a little more,
 you know.

04:31.804 --> 04:33.872
 Easy isn't a reason  to do something.

04:33.972 --> 04:36.108
 I'm not gonna change who  I am
for jerks like that.

04:36.208 --> 04:37.340
 And P.S...

04:39.111 --> 04:40.713
 You know what,

04:40.813 --> 04:42.979
you should come see our show.

04:45.683 --> 04:47.185
You're a stripper.

04:47.285 --> 04:49.085
 And you're a terrorist.

04:49.321 --> 04:50.889
 Excuse me?

04:50.989 --> 04:54.059
 Look, I'm just saying that
 you shouldn't pass judgement

04:54.159 --> 04:55.959
 on something that you
 know nothing about.

04:57.229 --> 04:58.729
 My chariot awaits.

04:59.498 --> 05:00.897
 Later, beautiful.

05:10.676 --> 05:12.411
 You know, you didn't have
 to cancel your Khutbah

05:12.511 --> 05:14.880
 over a small trouble,
 you always overreact.

05:14.980 --> 05:17.416
 Nonsense, you are my brother,

05:17.516 --> 05:18.650
 it is my duty.

05:18.750 --> 05:19.885
 But I think Allah
 would forgive you

05:19.985 --> 05:21.920
 if you came one
 hour later, no?

05:22.020 --> 05:23.889
 Where's your Nasrani
 wife anyway?

05:23.989 --> 05:27.593
 Maybe your weak heart is proof
 God doesn't always forgive.

05:27.693 --> 05:28.927
 Please, brother.

05:29.027 --> 05:30.345
 Your son should understand

05:30.445 --> 05:31.764
 what happens when you
 go against the family.

05:31.864 --> 05:32.896
 Yousef, please.

05:33.532 --> 05:34.765
 All right, another time.

05:35.534 --> 05:37.903
 Eh, are you going
 to come to mosque

05:38.003 --> 05:40.604
 before supper for
 Salat Al Maghrib?

05:41.039 --> 05:43.776
 Uh, sure, Uncle,
 sounds hype.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.077
 Praise be Allah,

05:45.177 --> 05:46.779
 there is hope for you yet.

05:46.879 --> 05:47.911
 Yeah.

05:48.180 --> 05:49.780
 Ah.
 - Baba.

05:52.050 --> 05:53.384
 How are you feeling?

05:53.484 --> 05:54.917
 A 100% since you
 walked in the door.

05:56.054 --> 05:57.956
 Good news, I spoke
 to the doctors,

05:58.056 --> 05:58.924
 and you get to come home.

05:59.024 --> 06:00.926
 Well, seriously I feel fine.

06:01.026 --> 06:04.463
 Mahmood, go and see if your
 father can be discharged.

06:04.563 --> 06:06.799
 But he can,
 Fatima was just told.

06:06.899 --> 06:09.800
 Go and check to be sure.

06:10.569 --> 06:11.802
 But I-

06:16.742 --> 06:18.644
 I'm gonna text Mom
 to get dinner things

06:18.744 --> 06:19.978
 'cause she's freaking out.

06:20.078 --> 06:21.480
 Yeah, and tell her that, uh,

06:21.580 --> 06:22.981
 your uncle is of
 course dining with us.

06:23.081 --> 06:24.549
 Excellent!

06:24.649 --> 06:26.118
 Your wife might be the
 shame of the family,

06:26.218 --> 06:28.485
but she makes excellent lamb.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.992
 I am merely suggesting
 that women in Toronto

06:34.092 --> 06:36.829
 can be tempting for
 a young man, huh?

06:36.929 --> 06:38.831
 Your wife should be
 your spiritual equal

06:38.931 --> 06:41.832
 and not just a great cook.

06:42.234 --> 06:44.670
 These Toronto love stories,

06:44.770 --> 06:46.972
 uh, they cloud judgement.

06:47.072 --> 06:49.508
 This is why marriage should
 be a family decision.

06:49.608 --> 06:50.841
 It makes sense.

06:51.777 --> 06:52.978
 And Masihin,

06:53.078 --> 06:54.680
 doesn't the Quran
 speak of believers,

06:54.780 --> 06:56.148
 so it could be
 anyone with faith?

06:56.248 --> 06:57.983
 This is your father speaking.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.852
 You know, the Quran
 has one interpretation.

06:59.952 --> 07:01.854
 It is not for us, brother,

07:01.954 --> 07:05.157
 to make arguments to fit our
 impulses within its pages.

07:05.257 --> 07:09.027
 Nor is it for us to justify
 all traditions with its words.

07:09.127 --> 07:12.030
 This is a new time and place
 and calls for new habits.

07:12.130 --> 07:13.866
 Chapter 5, verse 5-

07:13.966 --> 07:15.033
 Okay, enough religion talk.

07:15.133 --> 07:17.536
 I just want to enjoy
 being back home.

07:17.636 --> 07:19.102
 Aw, Dad, but it's
 so interesting.

07:20.105 --> 07:21.540
 Your father has spoken.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.175
 Fatima, a question,

07:23.275 --> 07:25.010
 come, sit next to your uncle.

07:25.110 --> 07:26.861
 I'm just in the middle of-

07:26.961 --> 07:28.714
- Well, actually I
- will help Olivia.

07:28.814 --> 07:30.048
 You should be resting.

07:30.148 --> 07:33.018
I rest my eyes on your mother.

07:33.118 --> 07:35.554
 Didn't the Prophet Muhammad
 himself do the housework?

07:35.654 --> 07:37.053
 Yeah, let's talk.

07:38.824 --> 07:40.023
 What's wrong?

07:40.826 --> 07:42.027
 Sit.

07:42.127 --> 07:44.029
 How do you know
 something is wrong?

07:44.129 --> 07:47.065
 It is my job to notice,
 I am an Imam,

07:47.165 --> 07:48.200
 and to guide.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.200
 Here, let's talk.

07:52.838 --> 07:54.070
 Well, um-

07:55.307 --> 07:59.211
 I've taken on the
 hijab as you know.

07:59.311 --> 08:01.211
 I could not be more proud.

08:02.314 --> 08:05.050
 I thought it would
 make my path more clear,

08:05.150 --> 08:09.221
 but it kind of makes
 things tough at school.

08:09.321 --> 08:10.923
 Why should your
 faith bother anyone

08:11.023 --> 08:12.758
 at a place of higher learning?

08:12.858 --> 08:14.226
 Maybe it's me,

08:14.326 --> 08:17.229
 it-it's just everyone
 seems extra careful

08:17.329 --> 08:19.064
 around me now like,

08:19.164 --> 08:21.066
 I'm made of sugar
 or something.

08:21.166 --> 08:23.769
 What about the
 other Muslim girls,

08:23.869 --> 08:25.235
 birds of a feather?

08:26.038 --> 08:29.942
 It's fine, I mean,
 it's just school.

08:30.042 --> 08:32.107
 You'd be happier with a
 man to take care of you.

08:33.211 --> 08:35.614
 Then you could focus
 on taking care of him.

08:35.714 --> 08:37.249
 No, I don't really
 think that's it.

08:37.349 --> 08:40.785
I could introduce you to a nice
 young man from the mosque.

08:40.885 --> 08:44.623
What's she
 gonna offer a guy?

08:44.723 --> 08:46.091
 A conversation in
 thermal dynamics?

08:46.191 --> 08:48.126
 Shut up, M,

08:48.226 --> 08:49.795
 I have stuff to offer,
 I'm funnier than you.

08:49.895 --> 08:51.628
 Okay easy, cupid.

08:52.197 --> 08:54.099
 A woman is always
 discontent alone.

08:54.199 --> 08:57.636
 It's a man's job to make her
 happy by giving her purpose.

08:57.736 --> 08:59.137
 This is one of the
 great pleasures

08:59.237 --> 09:00.639
 of being a man, Mahmood.

09:00.739 --> 09:01.972
 All washed up.

09:02.741 --> 09:04.977
 Sorry, Uncle,
 but you're wrong.

09:05.077 --> 09:07.279
 Yousef, what are you
 telling my daughter now?

09:07.379 --> 09:09.980
 Only the truth, she knows.

09:10.916 --> 09:12.400
 Oh sorry, Dad.

09:12.500 --> 09:13.986
 The young peoples like to
 think they're different,

09:14.086 --> 09:15.819
 but humans are human.

09:18.256 --> 09:20.659
 Sorry, but how could you
 even think that this is-

09:20.759 --> 09:21.894
 Fatima.

09:21.994 --> 09:26.162
 I forgot to pick up Baba's
 prescription, do you mind?

09:30.402 --> 09:32.002
 Okay yeah, no problem.

09:35.774 --> 09:37.173
 Thanks.

09:37.943 --> 09:39.175
 And cover up.

09:39.411 --> 09:40.411
 Yes, Umi.

09:49.421 --> 09:51.955
 I don't need a man
 to take care of me.

10:00.966 --> 10:03.035
 That everyone didn't
 like in high school?

10:03.135 --> 10:04.036
 What's her name?

10:04.136 --> 10:05.136
 I don't remember her name.

10:08.974 --> 10:10.874
 Oh wait shit, come on.

11:42.367 --> 11:45.437
 You're going to both your
 parents' hell for this.

12:07.425 --> 12:08.825
 Here you go, baby.

12:09.928 --> 12:11.327
 Hey, what can I get you?

12:14.099 --> 12:15.333
 Hey, beautiful,

12:15.433 --> 12:18.170
 I said can I get
 you a cocktail?

12:18.270 --> 12:19.304
 I know that my
 hand-knitted scoop neck

12:19.404 --> 12:21.006
 is a powerful distraction,
 but I mean-

12:21.106 --> 12:23.008
 Oh, I don't drink.

12:23.108 --> 12:24.309
 I mean, you're cute and all.

12:24.409 --> 12:26.011
I'm not-I'm not hitting on you,

12:26.111 --> 12:27.846
 I'm-I'm the bartender.

12:27.946 --> 12:29.514
 Right, sorry.

12:29.614 --> 12:31.183
 I'm also an entrepreneur
 in the fashion industry.

12:31.283 --> 12:34.186
 I can custom knit anything
 from shirts to bikinis,

12:34.286 --> 12:37.489
 hats, uh, socks, shoes,
 onesies, plains.

12:37.589 --> 12:40.123
 I didn't think it
 would be so...

12:46.131 --> 12:47.131
 Wow.

12:51.603 --> 12:53.503
 Yeah, they don't mess around.

12:55.307 --> 12:58.376
 You're popping your
 burlesque cherry, huh?

12:58.476 --> 13:02.380
 Uh, um, I'm gonna
 get a little closer.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.515
 Sure.

13:03.615 --> 13:05.149
 To the show.

13:05.249 --> 13:06.882
 Oh yeah, sure sure,
 yeah the show.

13:07.485 --> 13:08.485
 Watch-watch out,
 there's a chair.

13:27.339 --> 13:28.406
 Sorry, sorry.

14:24.062 --> 14:25.463
 What the hell happened?

14:25.563 --> 14:27.966
 She really went in and
 it was fucking amazing.

14:28.066 --> 14:29.301
 Then a heel got in her eye.

14:29.401 --> 14:31.886
 My heel, I feel like shit.

14:31.986 --> 14:34.472
 Don't worry, honey, it missed
 your eye by half an inch.

14:34.572 --> 14:36.374
 Hold still.
 -I'm blind, I'm blind.

14:36.474 --> 14:37.609
- I can't see in my eye.
- You're not blind.

14:37.709 --> 14:39.609
 It's just blood.
 Here, here.

14:40.712 --> 14:42.612
 Bast, that scar's
 gonna look hot.

14:44.249 --> 14:46.316
 If she needs to get stitches,
 she can't dance tomorrow.

14:47.085 --> 14:48.453
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
 -I'm all right.

14:48.553 --> 14:50.488
Sinnamon, you know the choreo?

14:50.588 --> 14:51.739
 I've been here
 for three years.

14:51.839 --> 14:52.991
 Well, you're on
 for Bast tomorrow.

14:53.091 --> 14:55.327
 Hold on, who exactly
 is gonna kitten then?

14:55.427 --> 14:57.161
 Tomorrow's my new solo.

14:57.261 --> 14:58.997
 Right, and she can't pick up
 the clothes she just took off.

14:59.097 --> 14:59.998
 Exactly.

15:00.098 --> 15:01.998
 We'll find somebody.

15:02.567 --> 15:06.404
 Hey, bus girl,
 you came, you came.

15:06.504 --> 15:08.340
 Yeah.
 -And?

15:08.440 --> 15:11.009
 It was so powerful.

15:11.109 --> 15:13.011
 Oh, and someone dropped this.

15:13.111 --> 15:15.013
 It's mine, mine.

15:15.113 --> 15:16.514
 Catcha, why doesn't
 she kitten?

15:16.614 --> 15:18.114
 I mean, she's got
 a knack for it.

15:20.285 --> 15:21.486
 God says yes.

15:21.586 --> 15:23.021
 What's your name, sweetie?

15:23.121 --> 15:24.189
 Fatima.

15:24.289 --> 15:25.690
 Sorry, what did
 you want me to do?

15:25.790 --> 15:27.192
 The stage kitten picks
 up all the costume pieces

15:27.292 --> 15:28.493
 after each tease.

15:28.593 --> 15:29.494
 Normally it's my gig,

15:29.594 --> 15:31.663
 but tomorrow I'll be dancing.

15:31.763 --> 15:33.365
 Oh, yeah, I can't do that,

15:33.465 --> 15:35.667
 my folks are pretty,
 uh, conservative.

15:35.767 --> 15:37.369
 We didn't ask them to do it.

15:37.469 --> 15:40.205
 Although, that
 would be amazing.

15:40.305 --> 15:41.373
 It's easy, hon.

15:41.473 --> 15:42.374
 You'll be great.

15:42.474 --> 15:43.675
 No, I-

15:43.775 --> 15:45.675
 I should go, good show.

15:47.645 --> 15:49.379
 You want to kitten forever?

15:59.324 --> 16:02.225
 Fair enough, I get it.

16:02.627 --> 16:05.697
 Yeah, it just kind of makes
 things tough, you know?

16:05.797 --> 16:07.530
 Yet here you are.

16:09.167 --> 16:13.069
 Well, I've just never seen
 anything like this, I mean-

16:14.806 --> 16:17.575
 I know, it was all
 over your face.

16:17.675 --> 16:19.411
 I mean, you guys feel
 more comfortable naked

16:19.511 --> 16:20.545
 than I feel clothed.

16:20.645 --> 16:22.412
 The magic of burlesque.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.083
 Come on, I could
 really use your help.

16:25.183 --> 16:27.250
 Kittening is so easy.

16:28.186 --> 16:30.088
 I can't, I can't, my family-

16:30.188 --> 16:32.255
 Doesn't have to know.

16:35.660 --> 16:37.560
 Why do you wear it anyway?

16:38.696 --> 16:40.265
 The hijab?

16:40.365 --> 16:45.270
 It's a cultural symbol of
 my heritage and my faith.

16:45.370 --> 16:46.602
 Is that all?

16:47.372 --> 16:48.273
 I like it.

16:48.373 --> 16:49.572
 What was that?

16:50.708 --> 16:51.576
 I like the way it looks, okay?

16:51.676 --> 16:53.578
 I mean, it makes me feel good.

16:53.678 --> 16:55.111
 I knew it.

16:57.215 --> 16:59.284
 So, what would I do exactly?

16:59.384 --> 17:01.319
 Pick up the clothes,

17:01.419 --> 17:03.453
 glorify gender with
 glitter instead of glory.

17:05.723 --> 17:08.760
 Okay, that sounds okay.

17:08.859 --> 17:11.296
 Cool, see you tomorrow,
 the show is at 8:00.

17:11.396 --> 17:13.298
 You rock, love you, bye.

17:13.397 --> 17:15.298
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:26.411 --> 17:27.777
 Did you get the prescription?

17:28.580 --> 17:30.315
What no, I'll get it tomorrow.

17:30.415 --> 17:31.316
 Then why are you so late?

17:31.416 --> 17:32.484
 What's it to you?

17:32.584 --> 17:34.486
 Uh, I'm your brother,
 it's my duty.

17:34.586 --> 17:36.321
 Oh yeah, did
 Uncle Yousef tell you that?

17:36.421 --> 17:38.156
 Okay look, Mom was worried
 that Dad would worry,

17:38.256 --> 17:39.789
 so I promised I'd wait up.

17:40.892 --> 17:42.494
 Okay, sorry.

17:42.594 --> 17:44.660
 It's important to be
 there for people, Fatima.

17:46.898 --> 17:50.802
 So, if someone needs help,

17:50.902 --> 17:53.638
 I should be there
 for them, right?

17:53.738 --> 17:55.507
 Yeah, zakat.

17:55.607 --> 17:56.641
Is that a sparkle on your face?

17:56.741 --> 17:58.643
 Huh, no, I'm going to bed.

17:58.743 --> 18:00.176
 Good night.

18:03.448 --> 18:05.181
- Do you want a smoke?
- Yes.

18:06.918 --> 18:08.686
 Seriously, that
 Prof is so wack,

18:08.786 --> 18:11.171
 why even tell us that?

18:11.271 --> 18:13.658
 Yeah, so he went travelling
to figure out where he belongs.

18:13.758 --> 18:15.660
 Irrelevant to fluid mechanics,

18:15.760 --> 18:17.195
 but I get it.

18:17.295 --> 18:18.696
Maybe I should quit school too.

18:18.796 --> 18:21.697
 Oh yeah, to go where exactly?

18:22.934 --> 18:25.203
 God, every effing
 engineering Prof,

18:25.303 --> 18:27.539
 they think that their
 class is the only one.

18:27.639 --> 18:29.106
 Do you remember sleep?

18:29.206 --> 18:30.675
 Remember having better
 reasons for not sleeping?

18:30.775 --> 18:32.708
 Remember unicorns?

18:33.811 --> 18:35.678
 'Cause unicorns are
 only seen by virgins?

18:39.317 --> 18:40.716
 You're so wack.

18:44.789 --> 18:46.558
 Oh my god.

18:46.658 --> 18:47.690
 Ugh.
 -Jerks.

18:52.664 --> 18:53.863
 I got to go, guys.

18:54.499 --> 18:55.867
 You okay?
 -Yeah.

18:55.967 --> 18:57.567
 Snap me.

19:01.673 --> 19:04.574
 Boom, drop, out,
 take your time.

19:05.977 --> 19:08.312
 Ass.

19:28.833 --> 19:30.733
 Sinnamon, sink more.

19:33.004 --> 19:35.206
 Drop it down.

19:35.306 --> 19:37.607
 I need to see you eat the
 floor with your poom poom.

19:37.875 --> 19:39.277
 Not just the tip,

19:39.377 --> 19:40.910
 sit on the whole dick.

19:43.381 --> 19:45.450
 Mm, yeah.
 - Got it.

19:45.550 --> 19:46.918
 You think this
 chick's gonna show?

19:47.018 --> 19:49.287
 She'll be here, it's fine.

19:49.387 --> 19:51.454
 We'll find out in an hour.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.926
 Fatima, stop moving about.

19:57.895 --> 19:58.830
 Sorry.

19:58.930 --> 20:02.934
 Hey, why doesn't Mahmood ever
 help out with anything anyway?

20:03.034 --> 20:04.636
 Fatima, my angel,

20:04.736 --> 20:07.803
 your future husband will
 appreciate your efforts.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.807
 Baba.
 - Hmm?

20:12.043 --> 20:16.781
 What would you do if
 someone asked for a favour

20:16.881 --> 20:21.784
 from someone that would
 disappoint someone else?

20:22.587 --> 20:24.822
 That is a vague question,
 my dear.

20:24.922 --> 20:26.656
 What is the favour?

20:28.893 --> 20:30.660
 Well, cleaning up.

20:31.062 --> 20:32.964
 How would cleaning up
 disappoint anyone?

20:33.064 --> 20:34.666
 It wouldn't disappoint me.

20:34.766 --> 20:35.798
 Kitchen.

20:40.938 --> 20:42.974
 You are too soft on
 your children, Waleed.

20:43.074 --> 20:46.511
 Ah, the world is hard
 enough, brother.

20:46.611 --> 20:48.778
 I got glue on a part of my eye
 I didn't want it to go in.

20:50.615 --> 20:52.517
 Wait, how much glitter
 is too much glitter?

20:52.617 --> 20:54.450
 There's no such thing.

21:02.093 --> 21:03.693
 Oh my gosh.

21:09.934 --> 21:11.703
 So, church, huh?

21:11.803 --> 21:13.771
 That's new, you know,

21:13.871 --> 21:15.840
 aside from the annual
 guilty Christmas pilgrimage.

21:15.940 --> 21:18.843
 Praying every once
 in a while helps.

21:18.943 --> 21:20.878
 Yeah well, us Muslims
 pray five times a day.

21:20.978 --> 21:22.714
 You know that, right, Mom?

21:22.814 --> 21:23.915
 Just saying.
 - Oh hush, you.

21:24.015 --> 21:29.385
 Wait, I thought Becca and
 Wei Chen were coming over?

21:31.122 --> 21:32.857
 Yeah well, I-I just-

21:32.957 --> 21:35.858
 I thought, you know,
 with Uncle-

21:37.128 --> 21:41.032
 Yousef can be,
 well, bombastic.

21:41.132 --> 21:42.734
 But he means well,

21:42.834 --> 21:44.569
 he cares about you a lot.

21:44.669 --> 21:49.574
 He is in fact your father's
 most liberal brother.

21:49.674 --> 21:51.909
 The others won't
 even talk to him.

21:52.009 --> 21:53.411
 Oh, I have other uncles?

21:53.511 --> 21:54.661
 Exactly.

21:54.761 --> 21:55.913
 I didn't know that,
 where are they?

21:56.013 --> 21:57.749
 They got to be here
 somewhere, right?

21:57.849 --> 22:00.418
 Uncle, I don't, I can't
 find them, where?

22:00.518 --> 22:02.420
 I know he likes to
 ruffle your feathers,

22:02.520 --> 22:04.422
 but be good, okay?

22:04.522 --> 22:08.591
 Show your uncle that I
 didn't ruin the children too.

22:11.863 --> 22:13.431
 Yeah, sure.

22:13.531 --> 22:14.764
 Thank you.

22:27.545 --> 22:29.680
 You like a little ass love?

22:29.780 --> 22:31.916
- Ooze the glitter, Texas,
- I swear like a lumberjack.

22:32.016 --> 22:35.453
 Ooh yes, sexy lumberjack.

22:35.553 --> 22:36.954
 It's head, bum bum.

22:37.054 --> 22:38.089
 Ba ba.

22:38.189 --> 22:40.925
 Head, elbow, face, and chest.

22:41.025 --> 22:42.960
 Ooh, I'm not warm.

22:43.060 --> 22:43.995
 Okay, got it.

22:44.095 --> 22:45.963
 We'll flock each other
 for that so we're together.

22:46.063 --> 22:47.932
 I'm gonna be flocking
 this whole damn show.

22:48.032 --> 22:49.801
 Yes, you are.

22:49.901 --> 22:51.969
 Five bucks the
 kitten doesn't show.

22:52.069 --> 22:53.936
 I'm in, 10 for the
 no balls bail.

22:55.573 --> 22:57.642
 I know, why don't we get
 the sexy bartender to kitten?

22:57.742 --> 22:59.811
 Yeah, I mean, he
 already plays with yarn.

22:59.911 --> 23:03.479
 I got five bucks on
 Pussy Galore, Catcha?

23:04.582 --> 23:05.748
 She'll be here.

23:07.752 --> 23:08.986
 Cha cha cha cha cha.

23:09.086 --> 23:10.820
 Cha cha cha cha cha.

23:11.923 --> 23:13.124
 It is our duty to Allah

23:13.224 --> 23:15.493
 to preserve our traditions
 in this environment,

23:15.593 --> 23:17.829
 that is our test,
 our challenge.

23:17.929 --> 23:19.964
 Why preserve them at all,
 adapt, evolve.

23:20.064 --> 23:22.500
 Happiness is born out
 of knowing your purpose.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.835
 Look at this city,

23:23.935 --> 23:26.137
 it is full of lost
 and confused people.

23:26.237 --> 23:28.139
 Place and purpose.

23:28.239 --> 23:30.508
 You know, debating
 with you has no tail.

23:30.608 --> 23:31.843
 Don't you have a
 mosque full of people

23:31.943 --> 23:33.678
 who listen to you already?

23:33.778 --> 23:35.012
 Or your own offspring, huh?

23:35.112 --> 23:36.981
 My boys are busy
 becoming doctors.

23:37.081 --> 23:40.151
 Speaking of which, what
 are your plans, Mahmood?

23:40.251 --> 23:42.520
 Um, I'm just keeping my
 options open, right.

23:42.620 --> 23:43.688
 See, that's the Toronto way.

23:43.788 --> 23:45.857
 No one makes decisions
 about the future.

23:45.957 --> 23:46.991
 Hey, I'm in engineering.

23:47.091 --> 23:48.526
 Really, Mahmood,

23:48.626 --> 23:51.028
 you're going to let
 your sister outshine you?

23:51.128 --> 23:52.029
 Thanks a lot, sis.

23:52.129 --> 23:53.631
 Sorry, M.

23:53.731 --> 23:56.165
 Well, what do you have
 to say for yourself?

23:57.134 --> 23:58.167
 Answer me.

23:58.803 --> 24:00.870
 I don't know,
 uh, med school.

24:01.105 --> 24:03.174
 Really, son, since when?

24:03.274 --> 24:04.707
 Since now.

24:05.810 --> 24:07.879
 I'll be done my PhD by
 the time that happens.

24:07.979 --> 24:09.463
 Wonderful,

24:09.563 --> 24:11.048
 but don't forget about
 all my great nephews

24:11.148 --> 24:12.532
 while you're studying.

24:12.632 --> 24:14.018
 Oh, that young man I was
 talking to you about-

24:14.118 --> 24:15.186
 No, thank you.

24:15.286 --> 24:16.554
 He has a good job.

24:16.654 --> 24:17.887
 I'm fine.

24:18.823 --> 24:21.025
 Brother, keep a
 close eye on her.

24:21.125 --> 24:23.194
 Look, maybe I don't
 even want to get married.

24:23.294 --> 24:24.896
 Habibti, my heart.

24:24.996 --> 24:27.064
 Sorry, I just said maybe.

24:27.164 --> 24:29.066
 Like maybe I don't want
 to be as predictable

24:29.166 --> 24:31.736
 as Uncle seems to
 think all women are.

24:31.836 --> 24:36.073
 Yes, predictability is the
 essential beauty of tradition,

24:36.173 --> 24:38.576
 so each of us knows what
 role we have to play.

24:38.676 --> 24:41.078
 You are sweet and
 smart, habibti.

24:41.178 --> 24:44.079
 But surprising, hardly, hmm?

24:46.684 --> 24:48.217
 Fatima, help serve.

24:51.689 --> 24:52.590
 You know what,

24:52.690 --> 24:54.625
 actually I just remembered

24:54.725 --> 24:56.759
 I promised a friend I'd
 pick up her clothes.

24:57.161 --> 24:59.063
 You can't leave before we eat.

24:59.163 --> 25:00.596
 Surprise!

25:14.178 --> 25:16.111
 Mom, this stew smells amazing.

25:17.181 --> 25:18.950
 Go after your sister please.

25:19.050 --> 25:20.783
 But I want-
 -Now.

25:35.232 --> 25:36.700
 Come on.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.269
 No, Sinnamon, I need
 you to kitten the solo.

25:38.369 --> 25:40.104
 Trio tease is out.

25:40.204 --> 25:41.272
 What if I kitten that one?

25:41.372 --> 25:42.974
 No, you're helping
 my quick change,

25:43.074 --> 25:43.841
 you can't do both.

25:43.941 --> 25:45.258
 Catcha.

25:45.358 --> 25:46.677
- What if I help
- Texas quick change?

25:46.777 --> 25:47.811
 Or me.

25:47.911 --> 25:48.946
 No, I need you guys
 in the audience.

25:49.046 --> 25:51.114
 Forget it, ladies.

25:51.214 --> 25:53.284
 Idea, Catcha, why don't
 you do a second solo tease?

25:53.384 --> 25:54.285
 How's your back?

25:54.385 --> 25:55.987
 It's completely seized.

25:56.087 --> 25:58.656
 That's why I swapped
 my solo for the trio.

25:58.756 --> 25:59.657
 FML.

25:59.757 --> 26:00.825
 You're fine.

26:00.925 --> 26:02.293
 Hey, I know it's late,

26:02.393 --> 26:06.662
 but I'm here if you still
 need me to kitty or whatever.

26:08.232 --> 26:09.999
 Trio tease is back in.

26:10.267 --> 26:11.300
 Circle jerk.
 -Yes!

26:12.403 --> 26:14.169
 Glad you made it.

26:21.946 --> 26:23.312
 Stay grounded,

26:23.948 --> 26:25.180
 breathe,

26:26.283 --> 26:27.683
 feel each other.

26:29.253 --> 26:32.321
 Poom poom power!

26:33.124 --> 26:34.191
 Oh, coming through.

26:34.291 --> 26:35.691
 Okay, I'll let you go first.

26:37.294 --> 26:38.861
 I like your scarf.

26:39.263 --> 26:40.696
 Welcome back.

26:41.966 --> 26:43.167
 What colour bra
 are you wearing?

26:43.267 --> 26:44.168
 Black.

26:44.268 --> 26:45.868
 Oooh, sexy.

26:50.307 --> 26:51.874
 Here's your outfit.

26:54.278 --> 26:55.878
 Where's the rest of it?

26:57.148 --> 26:58.883
 I can't make you
 wear anything.

26:58.983 --> 27:01.884
 I just think that
 this looks good.

27:05.823 --> 27:07.056
 Okay.

27:17.835 --> 27:21.906
 Okay, well technically I
should at least cover my awrah.

27:22.006 --> 27:23.238
 Your what?

27:23.841 --> 27:25.741
 Uh, my, uh, my-my middle.

27:33.350 --> 27:35.350
 Okay, what if I
 just cover my face?

27:38.856 --> 27:40.756
 Lady lesson number one.

27:47.865 --> 27:49.765
 Toe in, toe out.

27:53.204 --> 27:55.270
 Squeeze your butt in,
 make it graceful.

27:58.876 --> 28:00.945
 Walking is hard.

28:01.045 --> 28:03.245
 Fatima, get out there
 and clear the stage.

28:05.216 --> 28:06.350
 Okay.

28:06.450 --> 28:08.786
 Knees together,
 pull up, chin up,

28:08.886 --> 28:09.787
 stick your butt up,

28:09.887 --> 28:11.420
smile.

28:54.431 --> 28:56.000
 Whiskey and ginger.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.001
 You got it, bro.

28:57.101 --> 28:58.335
 Is that worsted wool?

28:58.435 --> 29:00.004
 Yeah, I do custom knits.

29:00.104 --> 29:01.336
 Sweet, bro.

29:03.941 --> 29:05.309
 You waiting for someone?

29:05.409 --> 29:07.309
 Uh, I'm looking for my sister.

29:08.946 --> 29:10.181
 Strip joint's a
 bit of a stretch,

29:10.281 --> 29:12.014
 but I like to
 be thorough.

29:13.284 --> 29:14.318
 $7.50.

29:14.418 --> 29:16.353
 She a troublemaker, huh?

29:16.453 --> 29:17.855
 I don't see her though.

29:17.955 --> 29:20.024
 Well, my job here is done.

29:20.124 --> 29:22.591
 I'll stay to finish my drink,
 keep the change.

31:01.058 --> 31:02.291
 Meow!

31:11.402 --> 31:13.604
 Bad boy, pay attention.

31:20.411 --> 31:21.478
 What the fuck?

31:21.578 --> 31:22.613
 That's what you get.

31:43.734 --> 31:45.334
 Fati?

31:49.273 --> 31:50.507
 I-I'm just helping.

31:50.607 --> 31:51.475
 What are you wearing?

31:51.575 --> 31:52.476
 Please don't tell Baba.

31:52.576 --> 31:53.477
 Are you kidding me,

31:53.577 --> 31:54.478
 I don't want to tell myself.

31:54.578 --> 31:56.013
 Please, M.

31:56.113 --> 31:58.182
 You're coming with me
 right now and we're leaving.

31:58.282 --> 32:00.651
 No, no, no, no, what
 are you, Uncle Yousef?

32:00.751 --> 32:02.519
 I'm your brother, you're
 not gonna be a stripper.

32:02.619 --> 32:03.487
 I forbid it!

32:03.587 --> 32:05.187
 They're not strippers.

32:08.459 --> 32:09.360
 Okay yeah, they take
 their clothes off,

32:09.460 --> 32:11.195
 but it's different,
 it's art.

32:11.295 --> 32:12.529
 Whatever, you're
 coming with me.

32:12.629 --> 32:15.530
 No, I'm not gonna
 let them down.

32:16.467 --> 32:18.533
 Fine, then I'm
 not your brother.

32:21.472 --> 32:22.506
 M, please.

32:22.606 --> 32:25.376
 I can't, I can't
 see you like this.

32:25.476 --> 32:26.377
 Don't talk to me,

32:26.477 --> 32:27.378
 don't look at me.

32:27.478 --> 32:29.144
 I no longer have a sister.

32:49.166 --> 32:52.067
 Ow, ow, oh shit.

33:21.698 --> 33:23.098
 Oh shit.

33:40.551 --> 33:43.587
 Oh, I'm sorry,
 I can come back out.

33:43.687 --> 33:46.590
 It's okay,
 it's intermission.

33:46.690 --> 33:48.290
 Oh.

33:48.725 --> 33:51.462
 I guess I had a
 bit of a meltdown.

33:51.562 --> 33:52.594
 I saw that,

33:53.864 --> 33:56.131
 but we never
 leave the stage.

33:57.701 --> 33:59.603
 What if there's a fire?

33:59.703 --> 34:01.136
 We burn.

34:04.875 --> 34:06.777
 How's your back?

34:06.877 --> 34:10.647
 I'm heavily medicated,
 so it probably hurts.

34:10.746 --> 34:12.148
 Let's move, girl.

34:12.248 --> 34:13.650
 You still got to put
 three chairs in a V.

34:13.750 --> 34:15.083
 Okay, it's the heels.

34:15.184 --> 34:16.617
 Yeah, chop, chop,
 chop, chop, chop, chop.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.322
 I like.

34:20.757 --> 34:22.793
 She's still wearing
 way too much clothing.

34:22.893 --> 34:25.159
 It's not the clothing,
 it's the confidence.

34:25.896 --> 34:28.163
 She's got something,
 you'll see.

34:34.905 --> 34:36.639
 You nailed it.

34:36.739 --> 34:38.509
 Not bad.

34:38.609 --> 34:40.511
 Uh, hello, I just
 did my first show.

34:40.610 --> 34:42.346
Can I get a little bit of love?

34:42.446 --> 34:43.679
 You were lovely dear.

34:43.780 --> 34:45.679
 No one doubted you would be.

34:46.917 --> 34:49.186
 Oooh, hot date tonight,
 Lake Lady?

34:49.286 --> 34:51.188
 Don't rush, make him wait.

34:51.288 --> 34:52.188
 I can't help it.

34:52.289 --> 34:54.658
 He's all arms,
 legs, freckles.

34:54.757 --> 34:55.440
 It's divine.

34:55.541 --> 34:56.541
 We will never
 fight over a man.

35:01.465 --> 35:04.668
- Rehearsal tomorrow with
- Sinnamon and Fatima in.

35:04.768 --> 35:06.201
 Tonight was a mess.

35:06.937 --> 35:08.372
 I'll see you ladies
 up there for a drink.

35:08.472 --> 35:09.771
 See you.
 -Oh, order me one.

35:12.943 --> 35:14.843
 So, think there'll
 be a second date?

35:16.313 --> 35:19.716
 Hell no, she'll be lucky
 if she makes it to last call.

35:19.816 --> 35:21.385
 What, why not?

35:21.485 --> 35:23.387
 She has a thing
 for fuck boys.

35:23.487 --> 35:24.686
 That's a thing you can have?

35:25.956 --> 35:28.859
 So, who's boning
 you these days?

35:28.959 --> 35:30.692
 Me? No one.

35:31.828 --> 35:33.062
 Oh, what a waste.

35:33.162 --> 35:34.398
 I saw Justin eye-banging
 you all night.

35:34.498 --> 35:35.866
 You a night rider?

35:35.966 --> 35:37.734
What?

35:37.834 --> 35:39.652
 What?

35:39.752 --> 35:41.572
 He's obsessed
 with Catcha Foxx.

35:41.672 --> 35:42.739
 Oh, he's so sweet,

35:42.839 --> 35:44.241
 but when he talks about wool,

35:44.341 --> 35:45.740
 I get so sleepy.

35:46.810 --> 35:49.746
 I get awkward with guys, so.

35:49.846 --> 35:51.248
 You just have to look
 them in the eyes.

35:51.348 --> 35:53.250
 It disarms them.

35:53.350 --> 35:54.484
 Hey, are you guys decent?

35:54.584 --> 35:55.719
 Oh, somebody's
 ears are burning,

35:55.819 --> 35:57.721
and by ears I mean.

35:57.821 --> 35:59.756
 Get your flirt on, girl.

35:59.856 --> 36:00.757
 Now?

36:00.857 --> 36:01.758
 No, next Tuesday.

36:01.858 --> 36:03.260
 Just look him in the eye,

36:03.360 --> 36:05.262
 don't look away until he does.

36:05.362 --> 36:07.262
 Come on in.

36:07.531 --> 36:09.266
 Hey, what's up ladies?

36:09.366 --> 36:10.734
 Beautiful show, Catcha Foxx,

36:10.834 --> 36:11.902
 honestly, they loved it.

36:12.002 --> 36:13.437
 Uh, you guys sticking
 around for drinks?

36:13.537 --> 36:14.605
 The guy upstairs is buying.

36:14.705 --> 36:17.774
 Oh yeah.
 -Hell yeah, shots from God.

36:17.874 --> 36:18.742
 He's just a super fan,

36:18.842 --> 36:21.461
 he really loved the show

36:21.561 --> 36:24.279
 and actually he ordered a
stitched rib silk yarn jumpsuit.

36:27.551 --> 36:28.783
 You okay?

36:29.553 --> 36:30.754
 I have something
 on my face or...

36:30.854 --> 36:32.456
 We'll be up in five.

36:32.556 --> 36:34.456
 Okay cool, see you upstairs.

36:37.561 --> 36:38.795
 What is wrong with me?

36:38.895 --> 36:41.765
 It just takes practice,
 it's okay.

36:41.865 --> 36:42.933
 Coming Catcha?

36:43.033 --> 36:44.468
 What'd I miss?

36:44.568 --> 36:45.934
 She wasn't kidding.

36:50.040 --> 36:51.808
 Do you have to go home?

36:51.908 --> 36:55.812
 Um, well there's either a shit
 storm waiting for me at home

36:55.912 --> 36:57.814
 or there isn't, I wouldn't
 know until I get there.

36:57.914 --> 36:59.483
 It's Schrodinger's cat,

36:59.583 --> 37:02.486
 so I might as well just
 hang out for a bit.

37:02.586 --> 37:03.818
 Okay.

37:09.926 --> 37:10.827
 Salut.
 -Salut.

37:10.927 --> 37:12.496
 Cheers, ladies,
 well earned.

37:12.596 --> 37:13.895
 Thank you.

37:19.069 --> 37:20.837
 You know a shot would help.

37:20.937 --> 37:22.673
 I can't, I don't drink.

37:22.773 --> 37:23.840
 Hey, Justin,

37:23.940 --> 37:25.976
 get her a virgin
 virgin Woolly Navel

37:26.076 --> 37:27.676
 on the fan tab.

37:28.445 --> 37:30.514
 You know, the, the
 better looking he is,

37:30.614 --> 37:32.349
 the harder he is to look at.

37:32.449 --> 37:34.518
 Let's try it with
 the super fan.

37:34.618 --> 37:35.984
 Now shoot him a look.

37:36.920 --> 37:37.988
 I don't want to distract him.

37:38.088 --> 37:39.854
 Yes, you want to.

37:42.092 --> 37:43.992
 Don't force it, don't.

37:45.796 --> 37:47.696
 Stop it. Ugh.

37:47.964 --> 37:52.002
 Okay, what's the difference
between stripping and burlesque?

37:52.102 --> 37:53.704
 Um, pasties?

37:53.804 --> 37:54.905
 Oh man.

37:55.005 --> 37:58.008
 In stripping, the observer
 imposes their fantasy

37:58.108 --> 37:59.710
 on the performer.

37:59.810 --> 38:01.361
 In burlesque,

38:01.461 --> 38:03.013
 we impose our fantasies
 on the crowd.

38:03.113 --> 38:04.548
 It's a preference.

38:04.648 --> 38:06.550
 Some people like men,

38:06.650 --> 38:08.719
 women, threesomes,

38:08.819 --> 38:10.018
 farm animals.

38:12.656 --> 38:14.823
 We fuck the audience.

39:14.184 --> 39:16.184
 Justin, another round
 for the ladies please.

39:18.054 --> 39:21.089
Oh my god.

39:22.192 --> 39:24.795
 I don't always have
 so much sugar.

39:24.895 --> 39:26.797
 I am an asshole.

39:26.897 --> 39:28.281
 Okay,

39:28.381 --> 39:29.766
 promise me you're gonna drink
 some water before bed, okay?

39:29.866 --> 39:32.469
 Hey, look, look,
 I'm standing by myself.

39:32.569 --> 39:33.802
 Okay.

39:34.905 --> 39:39.974
And I'm walking by myself, see?

39:40.577 --> 39:42.644
 Wow, you really
 don't drink, do you?

39:43.747 --> 39:47.115
 I'm gonna look at you
 until you look away.

39:52.222 --> 39:54.491
 You guys are so beautiful,

39:54.591 --> 39:55.957
 I love you guys.

39:56.927 --> 40:00.130
You're
 beautiful too, Fatima.

40:00.230 --> 40:03.998
 Okay, are you okay to
 get home from here?

40:04.768 --> 40:06.136
 I am home.

40:06.236 --> 40:09.139
 Okay, rehearsal tomorrow.

40:09.239 --> 40:11.005
 Be safe.

40:49.646 --> 40:51.012
I chickened out.

40:52.649 --> 40:54.182
Just don't go back.

41:08.665 --> 41:10.901
 Ah, we're having
 songbird for breakfast?

41:11.001 --> 41:12.068
 Good morning, Baba.

41:12.168 --> 41:13.201
 Good morning.

41:16.006 --> 41:17.741
 Oh, angel pie,

41:17.841 --> 41:19.576
 these eggs look magnificent.

41:19.676 --> 41:22.076
 And the pinyo smells sublime.

41:24.314 --> 41:25.747
 I'll get my own.

41:28.018 --> 41:30.754
 Okay, I have a study date.

41:30.854 --> 41:33.056
I will see you guys later, bye.

41:33.156 --> 41:34.589
 Okay, bye.

41:40.196 --> 41:41.931
 You know,

41:42.031 --> 41:43.767
 it's a treat for a dad to
 see his daughter like that.

41:43.867 --> 41:45.767
 One day you'll know, Mahmood.

42:04.187 --> 42:05.787
 You're early.

42:06.189 --> 42:08.792
 I didn't know what
 time rehearsal was, so.

42:08.892 --> 42:10.126
 Girl, never before noon.

42:10.226 --> 42:11.261
 Oh, sorry.

42:11.361 --> 42:13.263
 Don't apologize, come.

42:13.363 --> 42:14.796
 Okay.

42:19.903 --> 42:23.807
 So, does your family know?

42:23.907 --> 42:25.275
 My mom comes to everything.

42:25.375 --> 42:26.643
 My dad doesn't,

42:26.743 --> 42:28.643
 but he knows burlesque
 is my thing.

42:29.913 --> 42:31.145
 Why?

42:32.082 --> 42:33.114
 The glamour,

42:34.250 --> 42:35.283
 the freedom,

42:36.252 --> 42:38.152
 feeling alive in my own skin.

42:40.256 --> 42:43.157
 Come, give me your weight.

42:46.096 --> 42:47.831
 Oh, sorry, sorry.

42:47.931 --> 42:48.999
It's okay.

42:49.099 --> 42:51.099
 Back to back.

42:53.019 --> 42:54.838
 Oh sorry, I'm, I mean,
 I'm hurting you.

42:54.938 --> 42:56.137
 It's okay.

42:56.940 --> 42:58.008
 Okay.

42:58.108 --> 42:59.009
 Again.

42:59.109 --> 43:01.511
 Where are you from?

43:01.611 --> 43:04.014
 My dad's from Syria
 but studied in England

43:04.114 --> 43:06.180
 where he met my mom.

43:07.951 --> 43:09.686
 She was born in Thunder Bay

43:09.786 --> 43:12.322
 and her family is
 Polish and Irish

43:12.422 --> 43:14.689
 with a hint of Ukrainian.

43:17.127 --> 43:18.693
 I'm just Toronto.

43:21.297 --> 43:22.864
 You're more than that.

43:23.800 --> 43:26.868
 Now look at me in the
 face and try to mirror me.

43:31.441 --> 43:33.343
 You're a magical creature.

43:33.443 --> 43:35.043
 Now they go inside.

43:36.279 --> 43:37.712
 Yeah.

43:39.315 --> 43:41.417
 And back.

43:41.517 --> 43:43.718
 And now let's try keeping
 the water droplet alive.

43:45.455 --> 43:46.888
 Whoa.

43:48.825 --> 43:50.058
 Yeah?

43:50.460 --> 43:52.360
 Come, close your eyes.

43:54.998 --> 43:56.199
 Just let it go.

43:56.299 --> 43:58.234
 It's hard to let it go.

43:58.334 --> 43:59.734
 Breathe.

44:03.173 --> 44:04.205
 No judgement.

45:14.410 --> 45:15.445
 Better?

45:15.545 --> 45:16.978
 Yeah.

45:17.413 --> 45:20.984
 This feeling,
 that's the beginning.

45:21.084 --> 45:23.286
 I feel like I just
 covered up everything.

45:23.386 --> 45:26.156
 I want to feel like
 this all the time.

45:26.256 --> 45:28.456
 You need a burlesque name.

45:30.426 --> 45:32.293
 How about Wobbly?

45:35.431 --> 45:39.002
Something.

45:39.102 --> 45:40.301
 Flirt.

45:42.405 --> 45:44.307
 Lousy Flirt?

45:44.407 --> 45:46.007
 Flirt Fail?

45:46.409 --> 45:47.310
 No, Flirt.

45:47.410 --> 45:48.478
 Let me think about it.

45:48.578 --> 45:50.346
 Okay.

45:50.446 --> 45:54.017
Too many Lenny's.

45:54.117 --> 45:55.852
 My body's not having me today.

45:55.952 --> 45:57.185
 Okay.

45:57.587 --> 45:59.322
 That's why I drink gin.

45:59.422 --> 46:01.357
Yeah, the drink of psychopaths.

46:01.457 --> 46:03.324
 Get it together,
 rehearsal in 10.

46:07.964 --> 46:11.367
 Left, back, right, front.

46:11.467 --> 46:14.335
 Left, back, right.

46:23.446 --> 46:25.046
 What are you doing?

46:25.315 --> 46:26.516
 Can you knock?

46:26.616 --> 46:28.384
 Look, I have to tell Dad.

46:28.484 --> 46:29.519
 Yeah, you think
 that's a good idea?

46:29.619 --> 46:31.385
 You're right, but...

46:35.158 --> 46:36.390
 Why, Fati?

46:37.327 --> 46:38.528
 I don't know, M,

46:38.628 --> 46:39.896
 being a girl here
 is such a treat.

46:39.996 --> 46:41.514
 Oh please,

46:41.614 --> 46:43.231
 at least you're not supposed
 to have it all together.

46:43.333 --> 46:45.268
 Just forget it.

46:45.368 --> 46:48.371
 I can't even stop my sister
 from working at a strip club.

46:48.471 --> 46:52.408
 Honestly, I-I don't
 want you to go back.

46:52.508 --> 46:53.508
 Please.

48:00.076 --> 48:01.377
 Shit, shit.

48:01.477 --> 48:02.979
 Oh, trouble in
 paradise over there?

48:03.079 --> 48:04.981
 I just got fired over email.

48:05.081 --> 48:05.982
 From the reception gig?

48:06.082 --> 48:08.150
 I thought they loved you.

48:08.250 --> 48:10.320
 Well, apparently my boss saw
 a photo on Insta and freaked.

48:10.420 --> 48:13.323
 Oh wait no, his wife did.

48:13.423 --> 48:14.991
 Well, at least you
 still have this gig.

48:15.091 --> 48:16.326
 Ha, that's very funny.

48:16.426 --> 48:17.558
 Ten minutes ladies.

48:19.562 --> 48:21.464
 Maybe Justin will
 put me back on bar.

48:21.564 --> 48:24.000
 No, I need you on stage.

48:24.100 --> 48:25.635
 Catcha, why doesn't
 Fatima learn the-

48:25.735 --> 48:27.503
 No, she can't dance
 like you yet.

48:27.603 --> 48:30.173
 Plus, we can't afford
 another dancer.

48:30.273 --> 48:32.173
 I don't even have a name yet.

48:34.110 --> 48:35.343
 Babylon.

48:35.745 --> 48:39.515
 Strong, powerful,

48:39.615 --> 48:43.584
 decadent, immoral.

51:21.611 --> 51:23.177
 Go kiss someone.

51:24.614 --> 51:25.813
 Kiss, not kill.

51:44.300 --> 51:45.368
 Who was that?

51:45.468 --> 51:46.702
 ("Of All the People Here"

51:46.802 --> 51:48.469
 by Freeman Dre and

52:06.322 --> 52:08.389
 Forget it, M,
 I'm not leaving.

52:08.824 --> 52:10.691
 If you won't leave,
 I'm staying.

52:11.794 --> 52:13.396
 What?

52:13.496 --> 52:16.566
 I'm your bother,
 I'll protect you.

52:16.666 --> 52:19.485
 What are you-

52:19.585 --> 52:22.405
 Ah, Babylon comes with
 her own manservant, I like.

52:22.505 --> 52:23.989
 This is not a good idea.

52:24.089 --> 52:25.575
 Now you've been dancing
 a record three days

52:25.675 --> 52:26.876
 we need someone
 to kitten, hmm?

52:26.976 --> 52:28.576
 But-

52:29.812 --> 52:31.412
 You stay, I stay.

52:32.815 --> 52:34.415
 Take off your shirt.

52:38.354 --> 52:39.720
 This is a bad idea.

52:41.857 --> 52:43.726
 Wait here to clear the stage.

52:43.826 --> 52:45.261
 I love.

52:45.361 --> 52:46.496
 This is a bad-

53:08.551 --> 53:10.784
 That's all of it, okay?

53:12.021 --> 53:13.621
 Do you mind?

53:29.872 --> 53:31.474
 You know, you're too beautiful

53:31.574 --> 53:33.476
 to be taking your clothes off.

53:33.576 --> 53:35.643
 Isn't that reason to?

53:36.579 --> 53:38.946
 Wow, you have a strong back.

53:41.417 --> 53:42.650
 Dudes are dogs.

53:43.753 --> 53:44.785
 You're tight.

53:46.055 --> 53:47.955
 You're too hard on yourself.

53:49.058 --> 53:51.460
 Uh, you-

53:51.560 --> 53:53.963
 You work hard,
 I'm, I'm really lazy.

 So stop.

54:13.082 --> 54:15.349
 Your brother looks hot.

54:16.952 --> 54:18.352
 This can't end well.

54:19.455 --> 54:21.691
 Catcha likes it when
 we go and mingle.

54:21.791 --> 54:23.526
 You are not paid to watch.

54:23.626 --> 54:24.694
 I'm not paid at all.

54:24.794 --> 54:25.695
 So, what do we do?

54:25.795 --> 54:27.997
 Just go and stir it up.

55:17.847 --> 55:19.048
 Oh sorry.

55:19.148 --> 55:20.499
 Include us in your next round

55:20.599 --> 55:22.049
 and we might not
 destroy your table.

 I love you too, Whiskey Neat.

 unless we're apologetic.

55:30.526 --> 55:33.429
 They get what we give
 them and that's it, okay?

55:33.529 --> 55:36.899
 Babylon, Catcha Foxx
 lost a pastie, you're on.

55:36.999 --> 55:38.532
 Now you're part of the show.

55:46.008 --> 55:47.610
 Go get it.

55:55.050 --> 55:56.083
 Be cute.

56:07.730 --> 56:08.962
 It won't stick.

56:09.732 --> 56:10.800
 Press harder.

56:10.900 --> 56:13.100
 I am, her boob is squishy.

56:15.204 --> 56:16.806
 Okay, it's on.

56:16.906 --> 56:19.324
 Okay, come on.

56:23.045 --> 56:24.478
 Nice work, Babylon.

56:33.222 --> 56:35.656
 Nicely done, manservant.

56:36.926 --> 56:38.393
 I need a shot.

56:38.493 --> 56:39.962
 Hold on, you can drink
 but your sister can't?

56:40.062 --> 56:40.963

 Oh, that's such donkey shit.

56:43.232 --> 56:45.501
 Hey, the Quran itself said
 alcohol is good and bad,

56:45.601 --> 56:47.670
 so I guess I'm just
 taking in the good.

56:47.770 --> 56:49.004
 Yeah, well the
 Quran can kiss my-

56:49.104 --> 56:51.674
 You know what, let's
 just have another shot.

56:51.774 --> 56:52.675
 Or five.

56:52.775 --> 56:54.009
 You know what
 your problem is?

56:54.109 --> 56:57.012
 You're always trying
 to control yourself.

56:57.112 --> 56:59.014
 Controlling myself
 is necessary.

56:59.114 --> 57:01.949
 Why, what's gonna happen?

57:03.619 --> 57:04.854
 You want to kiss me?

57:04.954 --> 57:06.688
 Not anymore.

57:06.788 --> 57:08.524
 See, you're free to
 do whatever you want,

57:08.624 --> 57:09.992
 but so are we.
 -Mmhmm.

57:10.092 --> 57:11.994
 Consent isn't enough anymore,

57:12.094 --> 57:13.694
 aim for enthusiasm.

58:03.145 --> 58:05.915
 Hey, great show ladies.

58:06.015 --> 58:07.082
 Thank you.

58:07.182 --> 58:10.052
 God, I miss getting
 naked with you guys.

58:10.152 --> 58:13.222
 Hey yeah you do,
 I just had a mini.

58:13.322 --> 58:14.590
 Yes!

58:14.690 --> 58:16.926
 I saw her eyes glaze
 over and I knew.

58:17.026 --> 58:17.927
 Jealous.

58:18.027 --> 58:19.878
 A mini?

58:19.978 --> 58:21.928
 Oh yeah, she's real
 happy right now.

58:22.865 --> 58:24.600
 I'd be mortified if
 that happened anywhere

58:24.700 --> 58:25.968
 let alone on stage.

58:26.068 --> 58:27.937
 What do you think it's
 there for, honey?

58:28.037 --> 58:30.439
 I could use a good one.

58:30.539 --> 58:32.942
 Mr. Skinny Freckles from
 Dublin was a bust, literally.

58:33.042 --> 58:34.777
 Anybody surprised?

58:34.877 --> 58:36.111
 You should try an
 island boy next time.

58:36.211 --> 58:37.079
 Ireland's an island.

58:37.179 --> 58:38.179
 I meant Montreal.

58:39.414 --> 58:40.548
 I just like the Irish guys.

58:40.648 --> 58:41.784
 Their skin feels
 like two-sided tape.

58:42.885 --> 58:44.620
 And on that note.

58:44.720 --> 58:45.955
 Hate to break up the party,

58:46.055 --> 58:47.089
 but ticket sales are crap,

58:47.189 --> 58:48.722
 so I had to cut your pay.

58:50.225 --> 58:51.376
 That's fine.

58:51.476 --> 58:52.726
 Thanks, girl.
 - Don't sweat it.

58:54.063 --> 58:56.265
 I need you to promote,
 promote, promote.

58:56.365 --> 58:57.798
 Don't be lazy.

59:03.739 --> 59:05.639
 Wait, this is what
 you guys get paid?

59:06.375 --> 59:08.110
 We don't do it for the money.

59:08.210 --> 59:09.979
 But you work so hard.

59:10.079 --> 59:11.113
 Nobody's keeping you here.

59:11.213 --> 59:13.113
 You just did it for the cash?

59:14.917 --> 59:17.985
 Uh, no, I'm not, it's
 just-just engineering brain.

59:19.088 --> 59:20.639
 My ex-boyfriend's
 brother is an engineer.

59:20.739 --> 59:22.389
 I fucked an engineer
 once and it was so boring.

59:25.094 --> 59:26.259
 Uh, so, tequila time.

59:27.763 --> 59:29.164
 Bye.
 -Bye.

59:29.264 --> 59:30.297
 Bye.
 -Bye.

59:41.110 --> 59:43.176
 It doesn't bother you
 to see me ordered around?

59:44.279 --> 59:46.181
I didn't ask you to follow me.

59:46.281 --> 59:47.848
 I'm your brother.

59:49.251 --> 59:51.186
 Don't pull that crap,

59:51.286 --> 59:53.186
 that's not why
 you're doing this.

59:55.124 --> 59:56.158
 You think I'm here
 for the women?

59:56.258 --> 59:57.326
 I can get my own women.

59:57.426 --> 59:59.277
 Whatever.

59:59.377 --> 01:00:01.327
 Besides, Catcha Foxx
 isn't my type of girl.

01:00:03.799 --> 01:00:07.034
 Catcha Foxx, really?
 -Don't, don't.

01:00:08.804 --> 01:00:09.954
 Don't.

01:00:10.054 --> 01:00:11.206
 Yeah, bring her home
 to Mom and Dad,

01:00:11.306 --> 01:00:12.174
 that'll be awesome.

01:00:12.274 --> 01:00:14.875
 And to Uncle, praise Allah.

01:00:16.979 --> 01:00:18.345
 I'm here for you, Fati.

01:00:19.281 --> 01:00:21.216
 Yeah, what does it do for me?

01:00:21.316 --> 01:00:24.186
 Well, it was either lose
 respect for you completely

01:00:24.286 --> 01:00:25.352
 or try and figure out why.

01:00:30.325 --> 01:00:33.228
 How are you so dumb and
 so smart at the same time?

01:00:33.328 --> 01:00:35.062
 It boggles the mind.

01:00:37.466 --> 01:00:39.232
 You been going to mosque?

01:00:42.304 --> 01:00:43.372
 I mean, I think about
 the principles

01:00:43.472 --> 01:00:45.739
 still every day, but-

01:00:47.009 --> 01:00:48.210
 Why, aren't you?

01:00:48.310 --> 01:00:51.078
 Only when Uncle's around,
 don't tell Mom.

01:00:53.482 --> 01:00:59.753
 I kind of miss it,
 but I don't know now.

01:01:00.322 --> 01:01:02.925
 Allah will forgive you if
your heart's in the right place.

01:01:03.025 --> 01:01:04.259
 Is it?

01:01:04.359 --> 01:01:06.927
 Why, Fati, why,
 why all this?

01:01:08.363 --> 01:01:10.397
 Look, I fit in for once.

01:01:11.333 --> 01:01:14.269
 Everywhere else
 I'm pretending.

01:01:14.369 --> 01:01:16.772
 At least on stage I'm
 not lying to anyone.

01:01:16.872 --> 01:01:20.109
 I mean, yeah I'm acting,
 but I'm not lying.

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:21.408
 It feels right.

01:01:23.378 --> 01:01:24.411
 Just tell Allah that.

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:26.413
 Yeah maybe.

01:01:27.382 --> 01:01:29.282
 What are you gonna tell him?

01:01:30.886 --> 01:01:33.255
 That he can like
 me best now

01:01:33.355 --> 01:01:35.424
 because my sister's
 a stripper.

01:01:35.524 --> 01:01:36.957
 Jerk!

01:01:37.893 --> 01:01:39.292
 Get out of here.

01:01:56.545 --> 01:01:58.447
 Oh, I was worried
 there for a hot minute,

01:01:58.547 --> 01:02:00.981
 bringing in a total stranger?

01:02:02.918 --> 01:02:06.321
 Is this about her learning
 the show faster than you did?

01:02:06.421 --> 01:02:07.322
 No.

01:02:07.422 --> 01:02:08.724
 You're lying.

01:02:08.824 --> 01:02:13.293
 Look, she was even accusing
 you of exploiting us.

01:02:18.433 --> 01:02:20.333
 What do you suggest?

01:02:22.104 --> 01:02:23.303
 Get rid of her.

01:02:26.942 --> 01:02:28.477
 Just 'cause she got
 promoted to dancer

01:02:28.577 --> 01:02:31.845
 does not mean that you
 got promoted to producer.

01:02:34.583 --> 01:02:36.349
 Go home, Sinnamon.

01:04:02.037 --> 01:04:04.940
 Wait, is it foom,
 hit, foom?

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.444
 No, it's foom,
 hit, wait, foom.

01:04:09.544 --> 01:04:10.445
 Right.

01:04:10.545 --> 01:04:11.545
 Everybody listen up.

01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:17.417
 Box office money is
 missing from my desk.

01:04:26.695 --> 01:04:29.963
That was from before, I swear.

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:36.821
 All right.

01:04:36.921 --> 01:04:38.437
 Well if you took the
 money then step forward.

01:04:43.712 --> 01:04:46.315
 Nobody gets paid until the
 money is back on my desk.

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:48.148
 Show is in an hour.

01:04:54.556 --> 01:04:56.491
 Where are you
 sneaking off to?

01:04:56.591 --> 01:04:58.409
 Just out.

01:04:58.509 --> 01:05:00.329
 Shouldn't you be
 prepping the MCAT?

01:05:00.429 --> 01:05:02.631
 Yousef called,
 you missed prayer.

01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:05.000
 Can you make a bit
 more effort please?

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:06.333
 Fine, can I go now?

01:05:06.735 --> 01:05:08.003
 Where?

01:05:08.103 --> 01:05:11.004
 I got a job, okay?

01:05:11.273 --> 01:05:12.507
 But that's wonderful,

01:05:12.607 --> 01:05:14.508
 your father will be thrilled.

01:05:14.608 --> 01:05:16.511
 No, it's, no, Mom,
 it's just not a good job.

01:05:16.611 --> 01:05:19.279
 Waleed, Mahmood has some news.

01:05:20.749 --> 01:05:22.184
 I got a job.

01:05:22.284 --> 01:05:24.486
 Oh, where?

01:05:24.586 --> 01:05:25.654
 It's nothing,
 it's at a restaurant

01:05:25.754 --> 01:05:27.354
 just bussing or whatever.

01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:29.358
 You know I worry
 about you, son.

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:31.192
 I mean look at your sister,

01:05:31.292 --> 01:05:33.028
 she's going to university
 with excellent marks

01:05:33.128 --> 01:05:34.529
 and you don't even try.

01:05:34.629 --> 01:05:36.365
 Bussing?
 -Love, he has a job.

01:05:36.465 --> 01:05:37.666
 Yeah, but I just
 don't understand

01:05:37.766 --> 01:05:39.501
 why he always let's
 himself be outperformed

01:05:39.601 --> 01:05:40.502
 by his sister.

01:05:40.602 --> 01:05:41.670
 My son is bussing.

01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:43.354
 Well, guess what,

01:05:43.454 --> 01:05:45.040
 she's on stage at the
 same shitty club.

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:47.207
 So, she's not so
 perfect after all.

01:05:56.785 --> 01:05:58.385
 Come back.

01:05:59.321 --> 01:06:00.553
 Come on.

01:06:13.635 --> 01:06:14.986
 Whatever you're feeling,

01:06:15.086 --> 01:06:16.536
 just leave it in
 the change room.

01:06:22.644 --> 01:06:24.244
 You're magic.

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:27.082
 And I don't care
 about the money.

01:06:27.182 --> 01:06:30.250
 We'll have a fundraiser
 and we'll move on, yeah?

01:06:31.186 --> 01:06:34.354
 Now let's go fuck
 them in the heart.

01:06:47.202 --> 01:06:49.602
 Fatima is performing there?

01:06:50.539 --> 01:06:52.607
 Oh, just, uh, she's dancing.

01:06:52.707 --> 01:06:53.642
 Dancing?

01:06:53.742 --> 01:06:57.112
 You-you mean at the
 club or on stage?

01:06:57.212 --> 01:06:58.580
 Look, they-they have
 entertainment at the club,

01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.581
 shows.

01:06:59.681 --> 01:07:01.281
 So, she's just helping.

01:07:02.384 --> 01:07:04.619
 What do you mean dancing?

01:07:04.719 --> 01:07:06.288
 It's a-it's a cabaret lounge,

01:07:06.388 --> 01:07:08.757
 so they do dance shows.

01:07:08.857 --> 01:07:10.623
 You know, kind of
 like vaudeville.

01:07:12.727 --> 01:07:13.760
 I see.

01:07:14.396 --> 01:07:17.632
 So she's...dancing.

01:07:17.732 --> 01:07:18.767
 Why didn't she tell us?

01:07:18.867 --> 01:07:20.635
 Look, it was a surprise,

01:07:20.735 --> 01:07:22.086
 and I screwed up, okay.

01:07:22.186 --> 01:07:23.636
 So maybe we just
 don't mention it.

01:07:26.241 --> 01:07:28.310
 We should go and
 see this dancing.

01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:29.478
 No, no, no, no, no,

01:07:29.578 --> 01:07:31.146
 you wouldn't like it.

01:07:31.246 --> 01:07:32.147
 It's, uh,

01:07:32.247 --> 01:07:33.615
 the-the music is terrible,

01:07:33.715 --> 01:07:36.485
 it's rock and roll, right?

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:38.320
 It's not even,
 it's not even,

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.654
 uh, it's dimly lit.

01:07:39.754 --> 01:07:41.323
 No, no, we support.

01:07:41.423 --> 01:07:44.493
 Dear, no one just
 dances at a club.

01:07:44.593 --> 01:07:46.328
 Maybe you should talk to her.

01:07:46.428 --> 01:07:49.331
 Or don't talk to her,
 because I can talk to her.

01:07:49.431 --> 01:07:51.498
 What club, son, hmm?

01:07:52.267 --> 01:07:53.502
 I-I-I don't know.

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:54.634
 What club?

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.576
 You're set.

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:09.243
 Damn, I want to be in this.

01:09:09.344 --> 01:09:11.412
 Mahmood, my man, what's up?

01:09:11.513 --> 01:09:12.581
 Rocking the range?

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.413
 Sweet stitches, Pop.

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:16.718
 What kind of place is this?

01:09:16.818 --> 01:09:18.518
 Do you have my glasses?

01:09:30.532 --> 01:09:31.765
 It's a cabaret lounge,
 music, shows,

01:09:31.866 --> 01:09:34.867
 dancing, drinks,
 you know, that stuff.

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:53.921
 What are you doing?

01:09:54.022 --> 01:09:54.922
 It was an accident,

01:09:55.022 --> 01:09:55.924
 I didn't think they
 were gonna come.

01:09:56.024 --> 01:09:57.457
 What?

01:09:58.727 --> 01:10:00.929
 Let's go, Waleed,
 you should be resting.

01:10:01.029 --> 01:10:02.531
 Yeah.

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:04.633
 No, no, no, this is
 their world, not ours,

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:06.468
 uh, we should
 give it a chance.

01:10:06.568 --> 01:10:08.202
 Glasses.

01:10:52.914 --> 01:10:54.681
 Oh.
 -Waleed.

01:11:01.456 --> 01:11:02.689
 Baba.

01:11:04.626 --> 01:11:05.858
 Breathe.

01:11:08.463 --> 01:11:09.831
 What are you doing here?

01:11:09.931 --> 01:11:11.998
 That is a question
 to ask yourself.

01:11:13.635 --> 01:11:16.871
 Hi, I need an
 ambulance to, uh, where?

01:11:16.971 --> 01:11:18.540
 1585 Dundas Street West.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.842
 1585 Dundas Street West.

01:11:20.942 --> 01:11:24.010
 My husband is having
 a heart attack.

01:11:50.004 --> 01:11:52.038
 I'm going to get a coffee.

01:12:22.704 --> 01:12:25.071
 I have nothing
 to say to you.

01:12:41.022 --> 01:12:45.794
 You always told me
 to keep an open mind

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:51.800
 about school, politics,
 about people.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.633
 This is different.

01:12:54.903 --> 01:12:55.937
 How?

01:12:56.037 --> 01:12:57.637
 It just is.

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.640
 But how?

01:13:04.078 --> 01:13:06.979
 People pay to look
 at your body,

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.984
 think disgusting thoughts.

01:13:10.084 --> 01:13:12.118
 Dad, it's not like that.

01:13:14.088 --> 01:13:15.657
 If you can't see
 it for what it is,

01:13:15.757 --> 01:13:18.124
 then this
 conversation is over.

01:13:45.787 --> 01:13:48.521
 She's as stubborn
 as you were.

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:52.992
 I knew she'd test me,
 but I never-

01:13:58.099 --> 01:13:59.532
 Call him.

01:14:00.969 --> 01:14:02.001
 You sure?

01:14:05.273 --> 01:14:07.876
 You told Uncle, seriously?

01:14:07.976 --> 01:14:11.045
 Well, better he
 hear it from us.

01:14:11.145 --> 01:14:12.080
 Okay.

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:14.881
 Oh man, what do you
 think he's gonna do?

01:14:16.117 --> 01:14:20.054
 He'll offer her guidance,
 this is his calling.

01:14:20.154 --> 01:14:21.721
 Yeah, guidance.

01:14:24.158 --> 01:14:26.728
 Okay, you all right?
 -Yeah.

01:14:26.828 --> 01:14:28.194
 I got to go tell her.

01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:35.902
 Hey, Mom.

01:14:37.839 --> 01:14:39.040
 Where's the coriander?

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:41.040
 I know it's around
 here somewhere.

01:14:43.678 --> 01:14:44.913
 Mom, I just want
 you to know that-

01:14:45.013 --> 01:14:47.213
 Oh, here it is of course.

01:14:48.182 --> 01:14:50.049
 It's not what you-
 -Hockey?

01:14:51.185 --> 01:14:52.086
 What?

01:14:52.186 --> 01:14:53.588
 Or figure skating,

01:14:53.688 --> 01:14:54.923
 everyone in Thunder Bay

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:57.089
 was quite happy on the ice,
 maybe that-

01:14:57.859 --> 01:14:59.759
 Uh-
 -You never know until you try.

01:15:00.695 --> 01:15:02.764
 Okay, okay sure, but-but-

01:15:02.864 --> 01:15:05.099
 Or I could bring
 you to my church.

01:15:05.199 --> 01:15:08.069
 No thanks, I'm not
 changing religions, Mom.

01:15:08.169 --> 01:15:09.604
 Is this a bad time?

01:15:09.704 --> 01:15:12.104
 Not at all, just cooking.

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:15.526
 Okay look, I just-

01:15:15.626 --> 01:15:17.111
 Oh wow, I forgot to
 preheat the oven.

01:15:17.211 --> 01:15:18.244
 I'm a mess.

01:15:19.881 --> 01:15:22.250
 Okay, I'll-I'll catch
 you later I guess.

01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:23.950
 Just-

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.119
 use protection, okay?

01:15:30.725 --> 01:15:32.258
 Mom, it's theatre.

01:15:33.361 --> 01:15:35.061
 Of course, dear.

01:16:00.922 --> 01:16:02.190
 They don't get it.

01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:07.128
 Hello, lovers, we are
 fundraising tonight.

01:16:07.228 --> 01:16:09.297
 Rhinestones are
 very expensive.

01:16:09.397 --> 01:16:12.166
 So one lucky audience member

01:16:12.266 --> 01:16:14.302
 is going to have
 a personal tease.

01:16:14.402 --> 01:16:16.838
 This is a once in a lifetime
 opportunity, fuckers,

01:16:16.938 --> 01:16:19.138
 so who's gonna
 give me $100?

01:16:23.277 --> 01:16:26.312
 Let them come,
 I'll be gone anyway.

01:16:27.248 --> 01:16:28.848
 Very generous.

01:16:29.784 --> 01:16:31.686
 Looks like our woolly
 handsome Justin

01:16:31.786 --> 01:16:35.023
 wants a break from
 bartending with a bid of...

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:36.324
 $225.

01:16:36.424 --> 01:16:37.758
 But think about how long

01:16:37.858 --> 01:16:39.193
 you're gonna be telling
 this story for, people.

01:16:39.293 --> 01:16:40.960
 $325!

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:44.598
 $325!

01:16:44.698 --> 01:16:46.167
 Will our star bartender
 get back in the game?

01:16:46.267 --> 01:16:48.034
 $330.

01:16:48.436 --> 01:16:50.038
 Five bucks?

01:16:50.138 --> 01:16:51.170
 Seriously?

01:16:53.307 --> 01:16:54.707
 Going once.

01:16:55.276 --> 01:16:56.878
 Hope they take credit cards.

01:16:56.978 --> 01:16:59.045
 Going twice.

01:16:59.814 --> 01:17:00.814
 $1,000.

01:17:02.316 --> 01:17:04.052
 Are you single?

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:06.620
 Maybe tonight.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.190
 Sold to the smooth ass
 stylish person in the back.

01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:11.192
 Come on up here, sweetheart.

01:17:11.292 --> 01:17:12.727
 Everyone in the room

01:17:12.827 --> 01:17:15.828
 is completely jealous
 of you right now.

01:17:18.466 --> 01:17:20.134
 You okay?

01:17:20.234 --> 01:17:21.903
 Nope, I need you to
 do the finale for me.

01:17:22.003 --> 01:17:23.905
 What about this dance?
 -Just go.

01:17:37.485 --> 01:17:39.919
 Just say goodbye already.

01:18:50.091 --> 01:18:51.993
 Oh fuck, her back.

01:19:37.972 --> 01:19:39.507
 You're killing it!

01:19:39.607 --> 01:19:41.040
 Whatever.

01:19:49.617 --> 01:19:51.385
 Look at this place.

01:19:51.485 --> 01:19:53.519
 Okay, just look for her.

01:19:55.623 --> 01:19:58.392
 Okay let's go, she's not here.

01:19:58.492 --> 01:19:59.525
 What?

01:20:04.498 --> 01:20:06.534
 Who are those guys?

01:20:06.634 --> 01:20:08.067
 My cousins.

01:20:13.474 --> 01:20:14.907
 Come on.

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:27.421
 Sit down, the show's started.

01:20:27.521 --> 01:20:29.388
 Excuse me, this is
 family business. We-

01:20:30.191 --> 01:20:32.093
 Hi there, handsome.

01:20:32.193 --> 01:20:33.559
 No thanks, thank you.

01:20:35.029 --> 01:20:37.098
 Uh uh, you don't
 want to piss me off.

01:20:37.198 --> 01:20:39.400
 She said sit the fuck down.

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.367
 Yo, Amir, these
 bitches are crazy.

01:20:42.503 --> 01:20:44.103
 Let go of me, you slut.

01:20:46.507 --> 01:20:48.107
 Out of my way.

01:20:49.043 --> 01:20:50.442
 Okay, move!

01:20:50.678 --> 01:20:52.444
 Get the fuck off my brother.

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:58.584
 Show is happening,
 you can leave now.

01:21:01.972 --> 01:21:03.457
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
 whoa, what you are nuts?

01:21:03.557 --> 01:21:05.457
 I'm defending myself,
 they attacked us.

01:21:08.062 --> 01:21:10.298
 Hey, what are you guys doing?

01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:11.599
 Mahmood, what are
 you doing here?

01:21:11.699 --> 01:21:13.301
 These girls are
 not hookers, man.

01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:14.435
 It's an artsy thing,
 all right?

01:21:14.535 --> 01:21:15.436
 Just go.

01:21:15.536 --> 01:21:17.138
 No can do, cousin,

01:21:17.238 --> 01:21:18.606
 your family's too
 weak to handle this.

01:21:18.706 --> 01:21:20.975
 Look, let us just take
 her home, it's cool.

01:21:21.075 --> 01:21:22.443
 She's confused,
 she'll come around.

01:21:22.543 --> 01:21:24.027
Haram.

01:21:24.127 --> 01:21:25.613
 Whoa, whoa, whoa,
 whoa, relax, relax.

01:21:25.713 --> 01:21:26.614
 She's my sister,

01:21:26.714 --> 01:21:28.414
 I see you guys twice a year.

01:21:40.594 --> 01:21:42.161
 That bitch fired!

01:21:45.099 --> 01:21:46.165
 Come on, he's not
 gonna buy that.

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:48.336
 I didn't do anything.

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:50.002
 It doesn't really matter.

01:21:51.739 --> 01:21:52.640
 Sinnamon.

01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:54.324
 What?

01:21:54.424 --> 01:21:56.010
 Oh now I can't even
 help protect the new girl?

01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:57.511
 Oh, I'm not good
 enough for that?

01:21:57.611 --> 01:22:00.514
 Fine, let them just take
 what they came for, fuck her!

01:22:00.614 --> 01:22:01.515
 I've been here longer,

01:22:01.615 --> 01:22:02.483
 I would follow you anywhere.

01:22:02.583 --> 01:22:03.484
 I'm a better dancer,

01:22:03.584 --> 01:22:05.486
 I'm a better performer.

01:22:05.586 --> 01:22:07.655
 Why should I listen to
 you any fucking more?

01:22:07.755 --> 01:22:09.188
 Stop it!

01:22:17.465 --> 01:22:19.198
 I'm causing all this trouble.

01:22:20.134 --> 01:22:22.036
 It's not your problem, Catcha.

01:22:22.136 --> 01:22:23.537
 Or yours, Amir.

01:22:23.637 --> 01:22:25.206
 I'm sorry you got involved.

01:22:25.306 --> 01:22:28.540
 Look I'm leaving,
 okay, problem solved.

01:22:30.311 --> 01:22:33.514
 Sinnamon, Catcha loves you,

01:22:33.614 --> 01:22:35.514
 you're just too
 dumb to see it.

01:22:40.488 --> 01:22:42.554
 And don't ever threaten
 my family again.

01:23:01.809 --> 01:23:05.413
Mahmood!

01:23:05.513 --> 01:23:06.714
 Hey, you want me to
 take a look at that?

01:23:06.814 --> 01:23:08.414
 I'm a pre-med.

01:23:09.183 --> 01:23:10.416
 No.

01:23:10.684 --> 01:23:12.553
 You know, you really
 screwed up this time.

01:23:12.653 --> 01:23:14.422
 There's no turning
 back from this.

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:16.088
 You don't exist.

01:23:17.658 --> 01:23:19.558
 What, come on, man.

01:23:23.697 --> 01:23:25.849
 What the fuck?

01:23:25.949 --> 01:23:28.102
 I was just protecting us,
 you from all this bullshit.

01:23:28.202 --> 01:23:30.102
 I was-
 -I don't want to hear it.

01:23:35.676 --> 01:23:37.745
 Too bad they had
 to go so soon.

01:23:37.845 --> 01:23:39.678
 Yeah, but with showgirl
 herpes though.

01:23:41.715 --> 01:23:43.715
 Yeah, they're gonna
 sparkle for days.

01:23:46.854 --> 01:23:48.122
 It's over.

01:23:48.222 --> 01:23:49.122
 she can't keep dancing,

01:23:49.222 --> 01:23:50.124
 not with a family
 that's involved.

01:23:50.224 --> 01:23:51.942
 You're her family.

01:23:52.042 --> 01:23:53.761
 Oh my god, I'm trying to be,
 but she doesn't listen.

01:23:53.861 --> 01:23:55.296
 And I'm sitting
 right alongside her,

01:23:55.396 --> 01:23:56.630
 so what type of man
 does that make me?

01:23:56.730 --> 01:23:57.598
 A great one.

01:23:57.698 --> 01:23:59.133
 Look, I'm gonna
 marry a Muslim.

01:23:59.233 --> 01:24:00.301
 Oh, when?

01:24:00.401 --> 01:24:02.636
You're
 not wife material.

01:24:02.736 --> 01:24:04.204
 Me?

01:24:04.304 --> 01:24:05.773
 A wife is domestic,
 she raises children.

01:24:05.873 --> 01:24:07.608
 Among other things.
 -She fasts.

01:24:07.708 --> 01:24:09.310
 I used to fast,
 then I got better.

01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:10.811
 Are you okay?

01:24:10.911 --> 01:24:12.313
 Look, a-a wife isn't
 a half-naked dancer

01:24:12.413 --> 01:24:14.315
 covered in sparkles,
 it's not an option.

01:24:14.415 --> 01:24:15.647
 Marry whoever.

01:24:16.417 --> 01:24:17.618
 Dammit, why are
 you so perfect?

01:24:17.718 --> 01:24:19.785
Practice.

01:24:22.756 --> 01:24:24.256
 The term is mad.

01:24:56.290 --> 01:24:58.824
 But my cousins,
 Uncle, really?

01:25:00.628 --> 01:25:02.363
 Why do you even
 care so much?

01:25:02.463 --> 01:25:03.697
 You are my family.

01:25:03.797 --> 01:25:05.031
 Well, then support me.

01:25:05.131 --> 01:25:06.367
 You have turned
 your back on Islam.

01:25:06.467 --> 01:25:07.701
 Okay, that's a
 little dramatic.

01:25:07.801 --> 01:25:09.203
 There's more than one
 way to be a Muslim.

01:25:09.303 --> 01:25:10.538
 There is one way,

01:25:10.638 --> 01:25:11.705
 the way written
 in the Quran.

01:25:11.805 --> 01:25:12.840
 That's not the same thing.

01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:15.207
 It's not. Allah, I am an Imam.

01:25:15.943 --> 01:25:18.546
 So, are you telling me
 I must submit to your will

01:25:18.646 --> 01:25:20.381
 as well as Allah's?

01:25:20.481 --> 01:25:21.682
 Show me, Fatima,

01:25:21.782 --> 01:25:23.551
 show me where in
 the Quran it says,

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:25.686
 what you do is not
 haram and I will follow.

01:25:25.786 --> 01:25:28.389
I don't need you to follow me.

01:25:28.489 --> 01:25:31.559
 Chapter 31 verse 24,
 in the name of Allah

01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:33.727
 the most merciful and
 the most gracious,

01:25:33.827 --> 01:25:36.697
 and tell the believing women
 to guard their private parts

01:25:36.797 --> 01:25:39.233
 and not expose
 their adornment.

01:25:39.333 --> 01:25:40.699
 Which pasties do.

01:25:41.835 --> 01:25:43.571
 You know that is
 not the meaning.

01:25:43.671 --> 01:25:47.741
 Look, Uncle, my private self
 cannot be hidden or revealed

01:25:47.841 --> 01:25:50.244
 with clothing because
 I'm more than just skin.

01:25:50.344 --> 01:25:52.580
 And let them not stamp
 their feet to make known

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:54.882
 what they conceal
 of their adornment.

01:25:54.982 --> 01:25:58.419
 Except what the
 hand possesses.

01:25:58.519 --> 01:26:00.421
 I could argue I
 possess the audience.

01:26:00.521 --> 01:26:02.723
 That is, you are
 twisting the language

01:26:02.823 --> 01:26:04.425
 to fit your purpose.

01:26:04.525 --> 01:26:05.757
 So are you!

01:26:06.827 --> 01:26:09.263
 You are a spiritual guide,

01:26:09.363 --> 01:26:11.263
 but you've abandoned
 my spirit.

01:26:12.533 --> 01:26:14.768
 If my own niece won't
 listen to my words,

01:26:14.868 --> 01:26:17.905
 how can I lead prayer and
 expect people to listen?

01:26:18.005 --> 01:26:20.441
 So, the problem is
 your reputation?

01:26:20.541 --> 01:26:24.778
 No, it is you putting
 your body on display.

01:26:24.878 --> 01:26:26.780
 Wake up, Uncle.

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.750
 Look, men will gaze whether
 a girl's wearing pasties

01:26:29.850 --> 01:26:31.785
 or a full on niqab,
 men will look.

01:26:31.885 --> 01:26:34.755
 It's a primal
 force of nature.

01:26:34.855 --> 01:26:38.792
 Look, burlesque releases me
 from the fear of that gaze.

01:26:38.892 --> 01:26:39.760
 It-it's my art,

01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:41.629
 it let's be myself,

01:26:41.729 --> 01:26:42.796
 and men don't own it.

01:26:42.896 --> 01:26:44.730
 And you don't own me.

01:26:51.739 --> 01:26:54.773
 Look, I don't want
 this to affect you.

01:26:55.743 --> 01:26:59.947
 I can cover my
 awrah with scarves,

01:27:00.047 --> 01:27:01.649
 would that help?

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:05.317
 I have a stage name,
 no one needs to know.

01:27:06.887 --> 01:27:08.787
 They will find out.

01:27:10.424 --> 01:27:12.493
 What about your
 connection to Allah?

01:27:12.593 --> 01:27:14.828
 Will you cover that too?

01:27:14.928 --> 01:27:18.799
 No, I believe Allah wants
 me to stay truthful to myself.

01:27:18.899 --> 01:27:20.668
 And truthfully,

01:27:20.768 --> 01:27:22.834
 God's gaze is the only
 one I care about.

01:27:25.606 --> 01:27:28.674
 Fatima, you are
 like my daughter.

01:27:30.944 --> 01:27:31.977
 Please.

01:27:33.614 --> 01:27:35.814
 Please reconsider.

01:27:41.955 --> 01:27:43.524
 I'm so sorry, Uncle,

01:27:43.624 --> 01:27:46.525
 but I couldn't stop
 if I wanted to.

01:27:51.632 --> 01:27:52.700
 A hijab pin?

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:53.834
 Those things get
 in everything.

01:27:53.934 --> 01:27:55.536
 Just like rhinestones.

01:27:55.636 --> 01:27:56.835
 Help me out here.

01:27:57.805 --> 01:27:58.839
 I dance, I lose my family.

01:27:58.939 --> 01:28:00.839
 I don't dance,
 I lose myself.

01:28:01.975 --> 01:28:02.843
 What do I do?

01:28:02.943 --> 01:28:04.545
 That's up to you.

01:28:04.645 --> 01:28:06.630
 And this shouldn't be
 such a big deal, right?

01:28:06.730 --> 01:28:08.716
 It's my body, why can't I
 just do what I want with it

01:28:08.816 --> 01:28:10.017
 like everyone else
 in this city?

01:28:10.117 --> 01:28:11.935
 Because it's not,

01:28:12.035 --> 01:28:13.854
 it belongs to your father
 until you get married.

01:28:13.954 --> 01:28:15.889
 Traditionally anyways.

01:28:15.989 --> 01:28:19.026
 Tradition and faith
 are not synonyms,

01:28:19.126 --> 01:28:20.561
 they can't be.

01:28:20.661 --> 01:28:22.394
 Then there's your answer.

01:28:26.967 --> 01:28:28.900
 I have to do it.

01:28:30.137 --> 01:28:31.870
 A burlesque tease.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.742
 It's the only way
 I'll know for sure.

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:35.874
- Yes.
- Yes!

01:28:36.677 --> 01:28:38.043
 Heck yes!

01:28:39.513 --> 01:28:40.746
 Or don't.

01:28:42.516 --> 01:28:43.917
 So what's the secret?

01:28:44.017 --> 01:28:45.419
 No secret,

01:28:45.519 --> 01:28:46.587
 just make it your own.

01:28:46.687 --> 01:28:49.421
 Yes!

01:28:51.859 --> 01:28:53.410
 How can I be angry with them

01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:55.062
 when the apple falls
 so close to the tree?

01:28:55.162 --> 01:28:58.065
 Your undoing was love,
 not lust.

01:28:58.165 --> 01:28:59.767
 Our father would argue that.

01:28:59.867 --> 01:29:01.935
 This was my fault,
 your Baba was right.

01:29:02.035 --> 01:29:05.072
 My father was a bully,
 may Allah rest his soul.

01:29:05.172 --> 01:29:07.608
 You inspired me to
 hold onto my faith.

01:29:07.708 --> 01:29:09.908
 You're my light and my rock.

01:29:16.717 --> 01:29:19.918
 Still, think of
 Fatima in that place.

01:29:22.055 --> 01:29:23.922
 Today I understand
 my father better.

01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:29.863
 But I'm not going to
 lose my children over it.

01:29:30.063 --> 01:29:32.099
 Yousef, I will not force her.

01:29:32.199 --> 01:29:34.032
 Will no one listen?

01:29:36.036 --> 01:29:38.103
 What am I supposed to do?

01:29:43.076 --> 01:29:45.343
 May God guide us all
 to the right path.
