[Nico] <i>Previously,</i>
<i>on</i> Marvel's Runaways...

00:09.945 --> 00:12.617
- Jesus, Alex!
- Found it in my dad's desk.

00:12.700 --> 00:15.080
Chase was right.
We've gotta protect ourselves.

00:15.163 --> 00:18.921
I don't understand. It's never
taken this long before.

00:19.004 --> 00:21.217
You don't feel anything at all?

00:21.300 --> 00:23.054
We're gonna need another sacrifice.

00:23.137 --> 00:26.352
- The solution is right...
- We are in trouble here, Victor.

00:26.435 --> 00:27.897
I know I screwed up.

00:27.981 --> 00:29.581
First the girl,
and now this false alarm?

00:29.651 --> 00:31.404
What is going on with you?

00:31.487 --> 00:33.324
Maybe the bracelet
is some kind of inhibitor?

00:33.408 --> 00:37.457
Which would explain why my mom
never wanted me to take it off.

00:37.542 --> 00:38.752
[screaming]

00:38.836 --> 00:40.673
Get away from her!

00:42.009 --> 00:44.013
Holy shit, it does what I say.

00:44.096 --> 00:46.142
Give me that. What is this thing called?

00:46.225 --> 00:47.854
Fistigons.

00:47.937 --> 00:49.774
I've made arrangements
for you at the Crater.

00:49.858 --> 00:52.822
- What?
- I sense that you're ready to go Ultra.

00:52.905 --> 00:54.491
So my parents are serial killers,

00:54.576 --> 00:56.162
and Karolina's mother
handpicks the victims.

00:56.245 --> 00:57.372
Alex cracked the files.

00:57.456 --> 00:58.736
They weren't about any ceremony.

00:58.792 --> 00:59.836
They were about...

00:59.919 --> 01:01.380
<i>Destiny isn't the only runaway</i>

01:01.464 --> 01:03.761
<i>to go missing from your church.</i>

Alex! Alex! Someone took Alex!

[chatter]

01:17.412 --> 01:19.834
Yo, G! That's my boy.

01:19.918 --> 01:22.339
You off to see that
fine-ass lawyer of yours?

01:22.422 --> 01:23.842
Whoo!

01:23.926 --> 01:26.347
Guess she can't get enough
of that Wilder flavor.

01:26.430 --> 01:30.606
Man! You get all the breaks, bro.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.860
You the one who's halfway out the door.

01:32.944 --> 01:35.031
I need every break I can get in here.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.419

01:55.990 --> 01:57.702
You're Geoffrey Wilder, right?

02:00.331 --> 02:03.589
Please. I'm sure you'll be
interested in what I have to say.

02:09.015 --> 02:10.936
Trying to run some shit
without my lawyer?

02:11.020 --> 02:13.483
'Cause I ain't going
for no plea bargain.

02:13.567 --> 02:17.199
Who okayed this? This is a
violation of my client's rights.

02:17.282 --> 02:19.203
Uh-oh, did it now.

02:22.042 --> 02:24.463
Perfect timing, like always.

02:24.547 --> 02:26.635
Catherine Henderson,
Mr. Wilder's attorney.

02:26.718 --> 02:28.095
The DA sent you?

02:28.179 --> 02:30.099
[chuckling] No, I'm here
of my own accord.

02:30.183 --> 02:32.312
I have a business proposal for you.

02:32.395 --> 02:35.026
I'm happy to continue with your attorney
present, if that works for you.

02:35.109 --> 02:39.076
She's in on every deal I make.
So, yeah, she stays.

02:41.372 --> 02:42.959
Very well, then.

02:46.257 --> 02:48.887
I believe your uncle left you
this property when he passed.

02:48.971 --> 02:51.100
- Is that correct?
- It's an old strip mall.

02:52.185 --> 02:53.396
How you know about that?

02:53.479 --> 02:54.983
I'd like to buy it from you.

02:55.066 --> 02:57.153
My opening offer is $5 million.

02:57.237 --> 03:00.410
Five million dollars for a junk
property in South Central?

03:00.493 --> 03:02.414
What's the fine print?

03:02.497 --> 03:05.671
I understand it's probably more
than it's worth, but...

03:05.754 --> 03:07.800
I'd like to make this agreement quickly.

03:07.884 --> 03:11.307
No white man's gonna drop
that much cake on some dump

03:11.390 --> 03:13.227
if there wasn't more to it.

03:13.311 --> 03:16.526
What, the X mark the spot to some
buried treasure or something?

03:16.610 --> 03:18.362
You're a perceptive fellow, Mr. Wilder.

03:18.446 --> 03:21.620
Truth is, you have
a hidden gem on your hands.

03:21.703 --> 03:24.207
I'd like to see it
reach its full potential.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.128
You're in real estate, then.

03:26.211 --> 03:29.051
Didn't realize Compton was on
the next gentrification train.

03:29.134 --> 03:31.598
I can't speak to future market value,

03:31.681 --> 03:34.854
but I assure you I have nothing but the
best intentions for this property.

03:36.023 --> 03:37.818
Perhaps you'd like some time

03:37.902 --> 03:39.446
to get the clarity you need.

03:41.116 --> 03:44.999
I'll see myself out. Thank you.

03:45.083 --> 03:48.381
Uh, no, I don't need
any more time in here.

03:48.464 --> 03:50.218
I got all the clarity I need.

03:50.301 --> 03:53.725
If someone like you wants to know
something in my neighborhood,

03:53.809 --> 03:55.521
then you gonna need a partner.

03:55.604 --> 03:57.273
Even with your fine legal counsel,

03:57.357 --> 03:59.987
you may be incarcerated for some time.

04:00.071 --> 04:03.452
Doesn't make for a very
convenient partnership.

04:03.537 --> 04:05.498
I can handle my business
from the inside.

04:05.582 --> 04:07.085
Not my business.

04:10.258 --> 04:12.596
I'm sorry, it's
a take-it-or-leave-it offer.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.433
You can keep the map.

04:21.697 --> 04:23.938
What if I were to say that in
a month he'd be a free man?

04:29.046 --> 04:30.966
That could be a different story.

04:31.050 --> 04:33.304
<i>- It's breakfast time for the cheetah.</i>
- Ooh.

04:33.387 --> 04:34.389
Ooh, got him.

04:35.517 --> 04:37.312
- Hey, hey.
- Yo.

04:37.395 --> 04:40.109
What's up, G? You don't look like a dude

04:40.193 --> 04:43.491
who just got a hand job
from his Tenderoni lawyer.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.078
What, she break up with you?

04:45.161 --> 04:48.627
Nah, nah, nothing like that.

04:48.710 --> 04:52.467
Your Nana B, she still got that,
um, that breathing thing?

04:52.551 --> 04:54.346
With the oxygen tanks and all that?

04:54.429 --> 04:57.102
Yeah. Somebody gotta go
check on it every day.

04:57.185 --> 04:58.730
Why you ask?

04:58.814 --> 05:02.947
And Tamar, she got two
little ones now, right?

05:04.116 --> 05:05.409
What's going on, G?

05:06.913 --> 05:09.292
What if I told you
I'd look out for them,

05:09.376 --> 05:11.171
take care of them for life?

05:11.255 --> 05:14.846
I'd say thank you, but why?

05:22.695 --> 05:24.991
Because I need something from you.

05:25.074 --> 05:27.203
To call it a favor don't do it justice.

05:27.287 --> 05:28.665
Okay.

05:28.748 --> 05:31.086
I need you to tell them

05:31.170 --> 05:33.465
that you shot Osiris, not me.

05:35.721 --> 05:40.146
I got a deal on the table
that'll change all our lives.

05:40.229 --> 05:42.943
The thing is, I gotta get out
of here to make it work.

05:44.989 --> 05:49.039
G, man, you asking me
to do a dime at least, bro.

05:49.122 --> 05:51.878
I know what I'm asking.

05:51.961 --> 05:54.132
We've always been there
for each other, right?

05:54.216 --> 05:55.218
Since we was kids.

05:55.301 --> 05:57.055
Yeah, man, but...

05:57.138 --> 05:59.267
I'm just an accessory to some shit,

05:59.351 --> 06:01.271
and like you said,
I got my foot out the door...

06:01.355 --> 06:04.946
Yeah, but you go right back where
you were, straight hustle.

06:05.029 --> 06:07.534
But what I'm saying, we move up.

06:07.618 --> 06:09.956
A different life, man,

06:10.039 --> 06:13.630
for Nana B, for Tamar and those babies.

06:13.713 --> 06:15.383
For you.

06:19.182 --> 06:20.519
[sighs]

06:25.111 --> 06:28.409
All right, big homie, I got you.

06:29.787 --> 06:31.248
Just don't forget me, G.

06:32.375 --> 06:33.375
Never.

07:19.970 --> 07:22.391
you're about to find out
who your father really is.

Alex, I-I don't know if you'll
even get this, but just...

08:48.565 --> 08:54.660
If you do, just call me, okay? I...

08:54.743 --> 08:58.793
- I don't even know what to say.
- What if it was my church?

08:58.876 --> 09:01.298
What if they figured out that we
got those files on all those kids?

09:01.381 --> 09:03.928
No, no, please don't tell me that
everything is gonna be okay.

09:04.012 --> 09:07.226
My mom is a murderer. All of
our parents are murderers.

Hey.

09:19.375 --> 09:21.589
[crying softly]

09:24.260 --> 09:28.018
The only way to figure this
out is to stick together.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.189
But right now, we just
need to get Alex back.

09:31.609 --> 09:32.736
Okay?

09:40.752 --> 09:42.463
You ready to go?

09:42.547 --> 09:45.512
Where are we going?
We have no clue where Alex is.

09:48.350 --> 09:50.104
Did you steal that from your mom?

09:50.187 --> 09:51.187
You're in trouble.

09:51.231 --> 09:53.151
You think it can help us?

I'm counting on it.

- [click]
- [Nico grunts]

09:59.288 --> 10:01.501
Show us the way to Alex.

10:06.469 --> 10:08.265
So much for the magical
Wiccan proclamations.

10:14.402 --> 10:16.156
[Karolina] What is that thing?

10:16.239 --> 10:18.034
I don't know, but I think I'm in love.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.623
The lights are pretty,
but how is this helping?

10:20.707 --> 10:22.794
I think it's the heat signature
of the car that took Alex.

10:22.878 --> 10:24.840
Yeah, the staff is trying
to lead us to him.

10:24.923 --> 10:26.969
- I'll drive.
- Wait! Hold on a second.

10:27.052 --> 10:29.725
I am all for the idea of rescuing Alex,

10:29.808 --> 10:31.352
but we have no clue
what we're going up against.

10:31.436 --> 10:33.524
- It could be my church.
- Or the cops.

10:33.608 --> 10:36.614
Alex and I found out our parents
were paying off the police.

10:36.697 --> 10:38.826
Okay, so, just so I understand,

10:38.910 --> 10:42.291
we're either gonna be facing off
against Gibborim enforcer types,

10:42.374 --> 10:44.337
or a corrupt branch of the LAPD...

10:44.420 --> 10:45.740
Could just be generic kidnappers.

10:45.799 --> 10:47.384
...with no weapons and no plans.

10:47.468 --> 10:49.013
We have the staff and each other.

10:49.096 --> 10:50.600
Plus, like I keep telling you guys,

10:50.683 --> 10:52.019
I'm really, really strong!

10:52.102 --> 10:54.525
Molly, not now! What about Chase?

10:54.608 --> 10:57.238
I sent him, like, a million texts,
but he hasn't answered any of them.

10:57.321 --> 10:59.075
Shouldn't he be here?

10:59.158 --> 11:01.398
We'll keep trying him on
the way, but we can't lose Alex.

11:07.007 --> 11:09.972
Do you think the Pentagon will
want to buy the design from me?

11:10.055 --> 11:12.393
If you can get the myoelectric
sensors operating

11:12.476 --> 11:14.815
at a quick enough response
rate, I don't see why not.

11:14.898 --> 11:16.401
I figure with
the right LAWS, these things

11:16.484 --> 11:18.614
will be able to shoot
a drone out of the sky.

11:18.698 --> 11:21.411
- LAWS?
- You know, laser-aided weapon systems.

11:21.494 --> 11:22.873
Yes, I'm aware.

11:22.956 --> 11:24.458
How is it that you know all this,

11:24.543 --> 11:27.298
but you've never gotten
above a B-minus in calculus?

11:27.381 --> 11:30.053
Calc's boring. I like
practical applications.

11:30.137 --> 11:31.347
[soft chuckle]

11:33.226 --> 11:34.228
Oh, I got it.

11:39.196 --> 11:42.286
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

11:46.545 --> 11:50.260
Uh, I-I know I've been hard on you.

11:52.724 --> 11:56.439
I'm just trying to get you
to be your best.

11:56.523 --> 11:58.986
I want you to do greater things
with your life than I have.

12:01.199 --> 12:03.537
You've, like,
actually changed the world.

12:03.621 --> 12:05.040
I'll never top that.

12:05.123 --> 12:06.250
Don't be so sure.

12:07.921 --> 12:10.384
You know, there was a time

12:10.467 --> 12:14.977
before the money and obligations...

12:15.060 --> 12:18.693
when it was just me, my
imagination, and my hands.

12:18.776 --> 12:21.280
It's when the ideas were the purest.

12:21.364 --> 12:23.493
Working with you reminds me of that.

12:25.038 --> 12:26.457
I like working with you, too, Dad.

12:26.542 --> 12:28.671
You know, there was
an invention in those days

12:28.754 --> 12:30.048
I could never quite get right.

12:30.132 --> 12:32.219
It was something very close to my heart.

12:33.848 --> 12:35.392
Maybe we could dig it out,

12:35.475 --> 12:38.314
see if we can perfect
the damn thing, together.

12:38.398 --> 12:40.485
Yeah. That'd be cool.

12:42.657 --> 12:43.657
Yeah.

Why leave your part of the world, right?

13:11.297 --> 13:16.600

white girls, and sushi.

13:21.275 --> 13:22.612

13:33.884 --> 13:34.886
Let's go.

13:36.139 --> 13:38.561
[indistinct laughter and chatter]

13:44.363 --> 13:46.492
This is my Nana B's place.

13:46.577 --> 13:49.123
Me and your pop
spent a lot of time here.

13:49.206 --> 13:51.294
G's mom worked three jobs.

13:51.377 --> 13:53.423
Anytime he needed a meal,

13:53.506 --> 13:55.553
place to go,

13:55.636 --> 13:57.264
my Nana B hooked him up.

13:57.347 --> 13:58.433
You two were close?

13:58.517 --> 14:01.648
Who, me and G? Shit. [chuckles]

14:01.732 --> 14:02.901
Tight as hell.

14:04.069 --> 14:05.363
He never say nothing?

14:05.447 --> 14:07.827
Guess I can't say I'm surprised.

14:07.911 --> 14:09.789
You know, I'm betting he never told you

14:09.873 --> 14:12.629
that I'm the reason
he got out of lockup so fast.

14:12.712 --> 14:14.423
Yeah.

14:14.506 --> 14:17.555
Your pops promised
if I confessed to his crime,

14:17.639 --> 14:21.228
me and my family would be set for life.

14:21.312 --> 14:24.109
He swore he'd never forget me.

14:24.193 --> 14:26.030
[distant telephone rings]

14:28.034 --> 14:29.579
You think he kept his word?

14:30.957 --> 14:32.543
Never gave you anything, did he?

14:33.963 --> 14:35.967
No money, nothing.

14:36.050 --> 14:38.597
Oh, G let me have his old turf.

14:38.681 --> 14:41.185
Acted like it was some grand gesture.

14:41.268 --> 14:45.068
But times changed since
your daddy was in the game.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.532
Ain't as lucrative
as it was when he came up.

14:47.615 --> 14:52.082
Else I just ain't got his flair
for community relations.

14:52.165 --> 14:54.921
[all chuckling]

14:55.005 --> 14:56.507
But meanwhile, my Nana B,

14:56.591 --> 14:59.221
the lady who slapped
Band-Aids on his knees

14:59.304 --> 15:01.727
and baked him his birthday cakes,

15:01.810 --> 15:04.983
barely got cash to pay
for her heart pills.

15:05.066 --> 15:07.446
Son of a bitch even had
the balls to threaten her

15:07.530 --> 15:09.784
just 'cause I asked him
to give me what I was owed.

15:09.868 --> 15:12.122
Damn.

15:12.205 --> 15:15.462
Looks like you already know what
type of catch your old man is.

15:15.546 --> 15:17.967
All I know is that I'm nothing like him.

15:20.138 --> 15:22.100
I'm sorry for what he's done.

15:25.023 --> 15:27.069
[cell phone rings]

15:27.152 --> 15:28.614
Who is calling?

15:30.450 --> 15:33.665
Oh! It's your girl.

15:33.749 --> 15:35.711
Six missed calls. [laughs]

15:35.795 --> 15:38.341
But you can't holla back
just yet, young homie.

15:38.424 --> 15:40.178
Be easy.

15:44.854 --> 15:46.983
[cell phone rings]

15:51.158 --> 15:54.206
<i>Big G! What's up?</i>

15:54.289 --> 15:55.751
Say something to your pops.

15:55.835 --> 15:57.212
Hi, Dad.

15:57.295 --> 15:59.466
Alex, you all right?

15:59.551 --> 16:01.053
I'm okay.

16:01.137 --> 16:03.600
That situation could change
if you and me can't come

16:03.684 --> 16:05.938
to a hospitable conclusion
to this whole thing.

16:06.021 --> 16:08.735
- I got your 50k.
- 50k?

16:10.405 --> 16:12.869
Did this player just say 50k?

16:12.952 --> 16:15.206
Oh, no, no, G.

16:15.290 --> 16:17.587
50k was the family discount.

16:17.670 --> 16:19.674
<i>We ain't family no more.</i>

16:19.757 --> 16:21.887
<i>New price is a straight million.</i>

16:21.970 --> 16:23.515
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

16:23.599 --> 16:26.228
One million dollars,
and I don't take checks.

16:26.312 --> 16:27.982
Meet me in an hour at the park.

16:28.065 --> 16:29.484
<i>You know the one.</i>

16:31.322 --> 16:34.494
Hey. Dinner's almost here.

16:34.579 --> 16:36.373
Who were you on the phone with?

16:36.457 --> 16:39.046
Just a... wrong number.

16:41.635 --> 16:42.762
I gotta step out.

16:42.845 --> 16:44.348
I gotta take care of something.

16:48.941 --> 16:52.823
Flores, I need three guys
in an unmarked car, now.

16:59.784 --> 17:01.537
We need to slow down, okay?

17:01.562 --> 17:03.427
- I don't want to lose Alex!
- We'll lose him if we crash!

17:03.512 --> 17:05.196
...swerving, it's about crashing.

17:05.222 --> 17:06.564
It's not about how sick I feel,

17:06.589 --> 17:08.646
but it's also a little bit
about how sick I feel.

17:08.730 --> 17:11.987
This kind of reminds me
of Magic Mountain or Six Flags.

17:12.069 --> 17:13.446
[Molly laughs]

17:13.531 --> 17:16.203
Karolina, are you checking
your blind spots?

17:16.287 --> 17:18.625
We're almost there. Refill?

17:19.711 --> 17:21.213
Oh, thanks.

17:21.297 --> 17:24.679
[machinery whirrs]

[beep]

17:32.360 --> 17:34.031
Hey, what's going on?

17:34.114 --> 17:35.754
I'm with everyone.
We need your assistance

17:35.784 --> 17:38.998
to save Alex from
some unidentified abductors.

17:38.999 --> 17:40.035
What?

17:40.036 --> 17:42.255
<i>There's a lot of insanity to fill you
on, but we'll get to that later, okay?</i>

17:42.339 --> 17:44.927
Right now just get in your car and I'm
gonna send you our GPS address, okay?

17:45.011 --> 17:46.681
<i>Cool. See you then. Bye!</i>

17:50.856 --> 17:52.652
Relax, bro. Help is on the way.

17:54.906 --> 17:56.534
[all shrieking]

17:56.618 --> 17:58.622
That is, if you don't kill us first.

17:58.705 --> 18:00.542
- Karolina, you're doing great.
- Thank you.

18:00.626 --> 18:01.836
This is kind of fun. [laughs]

18:05.134 --> 18:07.180
How'd you guys find me, anyway?

18:07.263 --> 18:09.351
We called your dad's phone, fool.

18:09.434 --> 18:11.397
No, his security's tight.
He'd know if his cell

18:11.480 --> 18:13.234
showed any signs of being compromised.

18:13.317 --> 18:17.075
All I did was put a modified
EEPROM into his phone signal

18:17.158 --> 18:18.704
and snag the serial number.

18:18.787 --> 18:21.668
Five minutes later, his data was mine.

18:21.751 --> 18:25.133
What, you think the only people
good with tech lives in Brentwood?

18:25.216 --> 18:26.343
I didn't say that.

18:26.427 --> 18:28.013
You ain't had to say it.

18:34.109 --> 18:35.319
That your dad?

18:35.403 --> 18:38.702
What? [scoffs] Nah, man.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.875
Why do you work for him?

18:41.958 --> 18:45.339
I bet the trees in your 'hood
grows jobs and scholarships.

18:45.423 --> 18:48.137
Where I'm from, we don't
got too many trees, homie.

18:48.220 --> 18:51.018
Hey, who said y'all could get out?

18:51.101 --> 18:54.149
What's this? Y'all dating now?

18:54.232 --> 18:55.276
[gunshots]

19:00.119 --> 19:01.623
Go, go!

19:10.891 --> 19:12.227
[gunshot]

[Andre groaning]

19:18.405 --> 19:21.621
[panting]

19:23.249 --> 19:26.088
Alex, give me that.

19:36.693 --> 19:38.279
- Please help me, man.
- Dad.

19:38.362 --> 19:40.491
Give me a second, Alex, I need to...

19:40.576 --> 19:43.455
- Dad, I mean it.
- What is it, Al...

19:43.540 --> 19:46.546
Too late. Get in the car.

19:48.884 --> 19:52.181
[Nico] That-that-that guy
has a gun to Alex's head.

19:53.643 --> 19:55.313
- If you hurt him...
- You gonna do what?

19:55.396 --> 19:57.651
Make me pay? Shit, man, I already paid.

19:57.735 --> 20:00.741
You the one that owe the dues, homie.

20:00.824 --> 20:03.329
The odds of surviving a confrontation
seem increasingly slim.

20:03.412 --> 20:06.376
- I'm not abandoning Alex.
- But we have no chance!

20:06.460 --> 20:09.007
I say we do. Karolina, go!

20:13.223 --> 20:14.769
You shot Andre, huh?

20:14.852 --> 20:16.564
You think you a big man now?

20:16.648 --> 20:18.442
Huh? Like your pops?

20:18.526 --> 20:19.862
I didn't want to shoot him.

20:19.946 --> 20:22.033
You better not say anything.
You better shut up!

20:22.116 --> 20:25.164
Hey, hey, stop at this
stoplight, yo, slow down!

20:25.247 --> 20:27.001
We don't need no more heat on us.

20:33.389 --> 20:36.311
- Wait, stop! No, Nico!
- Get off of me!

20:38.525 --> 20:39.925
- What is she doing?
- Stopping him?

20:43.994 --> 20:46.289
Engine off.

20:46.373 --> 20:47.918
...Geoffrey Wilder's son.
You can get away...

20:48.002 --> 20:49.170
Deactivate!

20:51.133 --> 20:52.970
[Gert] Come back!

20:53.053 --> 20:55.517
- Molly!
- Let me.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.000
- What is she doing?
- I don't know.

20:57.604 --> 20:59.441
[Molly grunting]

20:59.525 --> 21:01.245
[Darius] Hey, go, homie!
What are you doing?

21:01.821 --> 21:02.990
[man] It ain't going nowhere!

21:05.119 --> 21:06.204
Molly...

21:06.288 --> 21:09.002
Get out the car. Get out the car!

21:09.085 --> 21:10.337
Get out.

21:10.421 --> 21:11.966
Hey!

21:13.427 --> 21:14.930
- What in the hell?
- No!

21:18.312 --> 21:19.355
Alex, run!

21:22.863 --> 21:24.617
You have superpowers, too?

21:26.078 --> 21:28.708
She's beautiful and she glows. Great.

21:28.792 --> 21:29.919
Yo, yo, man!

21:30.002 --> 21:32.381
I can't hold this much longer.

21:32.465 --> 21:34.469
That was cute.

21:34.553 --> 21:37.266
Y'all little kids best stand down.

21:40.565 --> 21:42.778
Got the whole gang together, huh?

21:44.447 --> 21:45.491
[grunts]

21:48.038 --> 21:49.959
What is happening right now?

21:50.042 --> 21:52.255
I think we're kicking ass.

21:53.675 --> 21:56.012
Chase!

21:56.096 --> 22:00.104
Nah, nah! This ain't how
it's about to go down.

22:02.651 --> 22:03.820
Protect us!

22:38.514 --> 22:40.852
You think you can stop
him with another shot?

22:40.936 --> 22:42.063
I doubt it.

22:42.146 --> 22:43.273
Maybe Molly can.

22:47.406 --> 22:49.912
How about we just call it a night.

22:49.995 --> 22:51.707
Shield off.

22:51.791 --> 22:54.295
[Alex] I'll catch up
with you guys later.

22:54.379 --> 22:56.258
Wait! Alex, wait!

22:56.341 --> 22:59.347
[Andre grunts]

22:59.389 --> 23:00.934
Come on, come on.

23:01.017 --> 23:03.815
[Andre groans]

23:03.898 --> 23:04.898
Come on.

23:08.031 --> 23:09.031
There you go.

23:10.829 --> 23:11.829
Dad!

23:13.375 --> 23:15.045
Hey, Alex!

23:15.129 --> 23:17.466
You okay? What happened?
Wh-where's Darius?

23:17.551 --> 23:21.308
- Oh, he took off.
- Alex, please, man.

23:21.391 --> 23:23.521
I'm sorry, I was just doing my job.

23:23.604 --> 23:27.320
Jesus, Dad, shouldn't he be
in an ambulance or something?

23:27.403 --> 23:30.660
I know a place where he can
get patched up, off the grid.

23:30.744 --> 23:33.666
- [Andre groans]
- I'm coming with you.

23:33.750 --> 23:37.632
Hey, I'm sorry, you can't.

23:37.716 --> 23:41.766
Get on that bus, get somewhere
safe, and call a car.

23:41.849 --> 23:43.936
He's gonna be all right.

23:45.064 --> 23:46.066
You're lying!

23:47.569 --> 23:49.990
And it turns out you've
always been a liar.

23:50.074 --> 23:52.996
Darius told me about everything,
about what you did to him.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.250
You don't know the first
thing about me and Darius.

23:55.334 --> 23:57.338
I'm not giving you a choice, son.

23:57.421 --> 23:59.384
Get out of here. Now.

24:03.559 --> 24:04.603
Now!

24:11.575 --> 24:13.078
[Andre hisses]

24:29.110 --> 24:30.655
<i>Where have you been?</i>

24:30.738 --> 24:32.324
Have you talked to Alex?
He never came home.

24:32.408 --> 24:34.495
<i>Alex is fine.</i>

24:34.580 --> 24:37.376
Cat, I got a live one, but I
don't think he'll last for long.

24:37.460 --> 24:38.921
Get PRIDE together.

24:39.005 --> 24:40.925
We need to do the sacrifice now.

24:43.054 --> 24:46.060
You're still here.

24:47.647 --> 24:48.858
Of course.

24:51.739 --> 24:53.868
I just wanted to be by you.

24:57.374 --> 24:59.337
And the sacrifice?

24:59.420 --> 25:01.216
We're trying.

25:02.301 --> 25:03.846
But it, um...

25:03.930 --> 25:06.810
it isn't going well.

25:06.894 --> 25:09.398
But we'll find someone.
We'll find a way.

25:09.482 --> 25:11.194
I'm sure of it.

25:12.415 --> 25:15.202
I hope you know

25:15.285 --> 25:19.063
how much I've loved you.

25:19.335 --> 25:20.713
[sighs]

25:30.107 --> 25:32.945
- Molly, you were such a badass.
- So were you.

25:33.106 --> 25:35.640
- I still can't get over those lights!
- And your staff!

25:35.868 --> 25:37.789
Alex! Whoa, you're okay.

25:37.872 --> 25:39.125
Guys, we have a problem.

25:39.208 --> 25:41.212
What are you talking about?
We got you back.

25:41.296 --> 25:43.091
Yes, and now we have
to save someone else.

25:43.174 --> 25:45.597
His name's Andre, he was with
the men who kidnapped me.

25:45.680 --> 25:48.000
- So why would we help him?
- He was just following orders.

25:48.059 --> 25:49.605
Isn't that what the Nazis said?

25:49.688 --> 25:51.190
He's the same age as us,
and I think our parents

25:51.274 --> 25:53.154
are about to do to him
what they did to Destiny.

25:53.194 --> 25:55.365
- Okay? We have to stop them.
- Are you nuts?

25:55.449 --> 25:56.785
We almost got shot back there,

25:56.869 --> 25:58.204
and now you want us to risk our lives

25:58.288 --> 25:59.498
for some guy that we don't even know?

25:59.583 --> 26:01.169
Do we even have a plan?

26:01.252 --> 26:02.589
The plan is making sure
no more kids die.

26:02.672 --> 26:04.760
Alex, we need to take a beat here, okay?

26:04.843 --> 26:07.557
Many of us have just exhibited
superhuman abilities

26:07.641 --> 26:11.439
after learning that there may be
a <i>Chinatown-</i> level conspiracy

26:11.523 --> 26:12.567
run by our parents.

26:12.651 --> 26:15.322
My head is exploding.

26:15.405 --> 26:17.535
Molly, how can you take a nap right now?

26:17.619 --> 26:20.667
You try lifting an SUV
with your bare hands.

26:20.750 --> 26:22.252
It's exhausting!

26:22.336 --> 26:24.925
At least you guys finally
got to see what I can do.

26:25.008 --> 26:27.012
I've been trying
to tell you for forever.

26:27.096 --> 26:29.016
Yes, Moll, we finally
believe you, but...

26:29.100 --> 26:31.104
Oh, and speaking of superpowers?

26:31.187 --> 26:33.149
Gert has a dinosaur
that she can order around.

26:36.072 --> 26:38.744
Are you serious? What?

Okay, yeah, I probably
should've told you guys,
