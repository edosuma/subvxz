Oh, my God, Brian, I went
to a baby rave last night.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.139
Dropped a
Flintstones chewable.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.373
It was a purple Betty.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.608
I was <i>flyin'!</i>

I was up till

00:43.944 --> 00:45.511
I don't even
know how late.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.980
Like, when I came home
The Mentalist was still on.

00:47.982 --> 00:49.014
Like, that's how late.

00:49.016 --> 00:50.282
Morning, family.
Anyone needs me,

00:50.284 --> 00:52.951
I'll be out in the yard
using my new riding mower.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.753
A riding mower?
For God's sakes,

00:54.755 --> 00:56.855
stop making all these
frivolous purchases.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.357
You just blew
all that money

00:58.359 --> 01:00.659
hiring that English-
to-raccoon translator.

Tell him to come
to act like an adult.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.541
Hey, what's up, Quagmire?

01:15.543 --> 01:17.376
Oh, <i>there's</i> the
sound of the birds.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.044
I thought they
all disappeared,

01:19.046 --> 01:21.046
because all I could
hear was a lawnmower.

01:21.048 --> 01:21.980
Oh, and what's that?

01:21.982 --> 01:23.315
The wind in the trees!

01:23.317 --> 01:24.483
Good-- that
still exists.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.318
What are you doing there,
planting some flowers?

01:26.320 --> 01:28.520
Hey, look, why don't you
go bother Joe, huh?

01:28.522 --> 01:30.189
I can't. He's in Vegas
for the weekend,

01:30.191 --> 01:32.191

gave me last night.

I can't remember what
the hell I did with it.

02:11.499 --> 02:14.266
(screams)
Oh, my God, a piece
of your brain came out!

02:14.268 --> 02:15.868
Aah! Well, that
can't be good!

02:15.870 --> 02:17.202
Well, maybe
it's not so bad.

02:17.204 --> 02:19.171

02:20.674 --> 02:22.674
Yeah, you're hungry,
aren't ya?

02:22.676 --> 02:24.042
He was a rescue.

02:24.044 --> 02:26.645
When I found him,
he was just walking face-first

02:26.647 --> 02:28.547
into a chain-link fence
downtown.

02:32.285 --> 02:34.086
All right, almost
done here, Glenn.

02:34.088 --> 02:36.088
There we are,
all finished.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.923
Well, look at this.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.691
Look what happened.
(chuckles)

02:39.693 --> 02:43.162
Well, by the laws of
to be roommates now.ve

02:43.164 --> 02:45.497
That's hilarious, Doc.
All right,
here we go.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.966
Now, I'm going to prescribe
a course of antibiotics

02:47.968 --> 02:50.636
and some painkillers and...

02:50.638 --> 02:52.104
Hey, Elmer.

02:52.106 --> 02:54.106
Hey.

02:54.108 --> 02:56.008
She sucks.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.346
Okay, Quagmire, before
we get your prescription,

03:01.348 --> 03:02.614
let's grab some bandages.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.316
God, this is such
an East Coast pharmacy.

03:04.318 --> 03:07.786
How are we gonna find
middle of all this crap?e

03:07.788 --> 03:11.023
Uh, I think he keeps them
next to the thousand-piece
puzzle of a lobster trap.

03:11.025 --> 03:13.625
I don't see it.
You mean, next to
the Kadima paddles,

03:13.627 --> 03:16.261
or next to the basic
black sweatshirt with
no writing on it?

03:16.263 --> 03:19.498
No, I think they're over
there between the rain
ponchos and the cap guns

03:19.500 --> 03:21.133
and just below the
balsa wood gliders

03:21.135 --> 03:24.002
and the net-bag
of flip-flops
and a beach pail.

03:24.004 --> 03:27.940
Above the set of jacks?
Yes, above the jacks and the
bicentennial playing cards

03:27.942 --> 03:30.542
and across from the giant
cage with the beach balls,

03:30.544 --> 03:33.045
next to the Wiffle ball bats
and the spark-spitting cars.

03:33.047 --> 03:35.981
I don't... Oh, next to the
wax bottles of weird juice.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.951
Yes, behind the plastic bag of
Mexican soldiers from the Alamo

03:38.953 --> 03:41.019
and the Super Elastic
Bubble Plastic.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.187
Oh, yeah, I got 'em.

03:42.189 --> 03:43.755
Hey, Mort.
How's it going?

03:43.757 --> 03:45.123
Oh, it's awful, Peter!

03:45.125 --> 03:45.958
Why? What's the matter?

03:45.960 --> 03:47.526
The pharmacy's going under.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.194
I can barely pay my bills.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.830
I can't even afford
the real pharmacy music.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.832
That's just me up there. Listen.

03:53.834 --> 03:58.604
MORT (a cappella):
♪ If this is it, ooh, wah,
please let me know ♪

03:58.606 --> 04:02.541
♪ If this ain't love,
you better just say so ♪

04:02.543 --> 04:04.142

They say I've got
Jewish honey in my voice.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.980
Jewish honey is mucus.

04:07.982 --> 04:09.615
But I thought you made
a lot of money here.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.917
I used to,
but it's all gone downhill

04:11.919 --> 04:13.285
since Muriel died.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.520
She could get away
with overcharging people,

04:15.522 --> 04:17.990
because they were always
mentally undressing her

04:17.992 --> 04:19.424
and then re-dressing her

04:19.426 --> 04:21.827
once they saw
the horrible mess underneath.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.596
But in that interval,
she robbed them blind.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.366
(sobbing)

04:27.368 --> 04:28.834
Ooh.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.135
Well, look, uh,
I don't know,

04:30.137 --> 04:31.169
maybe there's
something we can do

04:31.171 --> 04:32.704
to help you drum up
some business.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.006
You know, get
the word out.

04:34.008 --> 04:34.940

Okay, Mort, now, if you
want to get more customers

05:03.003 --> 05:04.936
in your pharmacy, you're
gonna have to do a promotion,

05:04.938 --> 05:06.972

"buy one, get one free."

Yeah, I get that.

Is that, like,
a Spanish word?
No, it's English.

05:14.348 --> 05:17.015
The whole thing's English.
Oh, 'cause it seems
like you're saying

the first part in English
and then some kind of made-up

Quahog's own Goldman's Pharmacy

07:26.780 --> 07:28.480

Nobody's ever gonna shop
in my pharmacy again!

07:55.008 --> 07:56.441
I'm gonna lose
everything!

07:56.443 --> 07:58.343
Aw, gosh, Mort,
I feel terrible
about this.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.812
I wish there was
some way we could fix it.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.114
You know, my cousin
had the same problem,

08:03.116 --> 08:06.084
but he lucked out,
'cause his business
burned to the ground.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.353
The insurance made him
a very rich man.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.689
(chuckles) Too bad we can't
just torch the pharmacy.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.424
Aw, come on, no,
we can't do that.

08:12.426 --> 08:14.192
That'd be like stealing
from the insurance companies.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.293
It wouldn't be right.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.461
Aw, they're bastards.

08:16.463 --> 08:19.130
Last year after I lost
my beloved Muriel,

08:19.132 --> 08:22.467
our life insurance company
refused to pay on her policy.

08:22.469 --> 08:25.136
They took what should have been
a pleasant experience

08:25.138 --> 08:26.805
and made it into an ordeal!

08:26.807 --> 08:28.273
Well, that doesn't
totally surprise me.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.509
A friend of mine
staying in my house

08:30.511 --> 08:32.043
got, um, injured,

08:32.045 --> 08:35.113
and my homeowner's insurance
wouldn't pay her doctor bills.

08:35.115 --> 08:39.017
Said the policy didn't cover
an "act of rod."

08:39.019 --> 08:41.186
Yeah, come to think of it,
they wouldn't even pay

08:41.188 --> 08:43.488
for the fetus Lois lost
when we went to visit

08:43.490 --> 08:46.024
the Museum of Staircases
and Spring-loaded Boxing Gloves.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.959
Yeah, you know, they don't seem
to pay out on anything.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.195
No, not at all, right?
Yeah, that's true,
they don't pay.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.130
Well, then I say,
screw the bastards!

08:52.132 --> 08:53.765
Let's burn
the place down!

08:53.767 --> 08:55.934
What?! Peter, we're talking
about a major crime here.

08:55.936 --> 08:59.104
This is not smuggling
oriental women into the
country in steel cans.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.705
This is a serious felony.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.507
Quagmire, this whole
mess was our fault.

09:02.509 --> 09:03.975
We got to make it right.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.844
And, look, as long
as nobody sees us,

09:05.846 --> 09:08.046
and we don't tell anybody,
then we're in the clear.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.049
Well, I guess I did kind of
destroy your business, Mort.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.084
All right, then
let's do it--
tomorrow night!

09:13.086 --> 09:17.088
Good. I'm just gonna
have to reschedule my
weekly re-circumcision.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.424
So, what are we doing today,
a little off the top?

09:19.426 --> 09:20.792
Yeah, but leave
a little up front

09:20.794 --> 09:22.360
so I have something
to play with.
Sounds good.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.929
(unzips zipper)
And take a look
at the back.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.130
You see that there?
Yeah.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.765
Yeah, let's trim that.
I don't know when

09:26.767 --> 09:28.199
that started, but
let's get rid of that.

09:31.170 --> 09:32.637
Okay, guys, listen up.

09:32.639 --> 09:34.439
This is a very
flammable mixture

09:34.441 --> 09:36.141
that's also
undetectable.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.944
If we put it on the electric box
and two of the outlets,

09:38.946 --> 09:42.380
then light them all at once,
it'll look like a short circuit.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.482
Geez, Mort, how the hell do
you know how to do all this?

09:44.484 --> 09:46.284
Oh, it's all
covered in
the Torah.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.620
Right after the chapter on
writing complaint letters

09:48.622 --> 09:50.989
that will result in
compensatory merchandise.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.358
Dear stuffed shirts
at Ritz Crackers.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.494
A chain is only as strong
as its weakest link.

09:56.496 --> 09:59.698
Just as a box of crackers
is only as appealing

09:59.700 --> 10:01.933
as its least intact sleeve.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.169
I am paying
for fully formed crackers,

10:04.171 --> 10:05.971
not butter crumbles.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.139
I don't buy your product
with broken quarters;

10:08.141 --> 10:10.709
don't stick me
with broken pieces of cracker,

10:10.711 --> 10:12.310
you miserable dicks!

10:12.312 --> 10:14.946
Regards, Mort Goldman again.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.991
All right, let's get to work.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.026
♪

10:40.706 --> 10:42.340
(loud whoosh)

10:43.309 --> 10:45.110
(explosion)

10:45.112 --> 10:46.711
Oh, my God, we did it!

10:46.713 --> 10:48.480
Hey, Peter, what
are you gonna tell Lois

10:48.482 --> 10:49.948
when she asks
where you were tonight?

10:49.950 --> 10:52.017
Don't worry, I got
it all covered.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.852
(roaring bray)

10:53.854 --> 10:55.920
(roaring bray)

10:55.922 --> 10:58.289
Ha-ha!
This is awesome!

10:58.291 --> 11:00.659
And Peter has no idea!

11:08.034 --> 11:10.468
Well, Mr. Goldman,
we've ruled out foul play.

11:10.470 --> 11:23.548
It looks like it was just
a case of faulty wiring.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.551
You hear what he said, fellas?
Looks like we pulled it off.

11:26.553 --> 11:27.652
Yeah, for now.

11:27.654 --> 11:28.987
I still got a
bad feeling.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.588
He's gonna find something,
I just know it.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.791
Will you relax?
We got an ironclad alibi.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.794
We were all seeing The Beatles
live at <i>The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

11:35.796 --> 11:39.497
(crowd cheering)

11:40.032 --> 11:41.032
(screams)

11:41.034 --> 11:43.068
PETER:
Sorry. I rode a bike here.

11:46.105 --> 11:49.007
All right, guys, all we got
to do now is keep a low profile

11:49.009 --> 11:51.142
and not mention a word
of this to anybody.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.610
Not even the police.

11:52.612 --> 11:54.012
That's right,
not a word to anyone.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.948
Nobody. Lips
are sealed.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.817
I want to tell somebody.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.118
Peter!
You shut your mouth!

12:00.120 --> 12:02.320
Hey, Mort, I, uh,
was really sorry

12:02.322 --> 12:03.655
to hear about
the pharmacy.

12:03.657 --> 12:04.989
Oh, thank you, Joe.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.991
I was very,
very sorry, too.

12:06.993 --> 12:09.327
Yeah, Joe. The insurance guy
said it was an accident.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.595
Yeah, he seemed pretty smart.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.031
His shirt was tucked in,
so I bet he went to Harvard.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.666
Well, you're my
friend, Mort.

12:14.668 --> 12:16.701
I want you to know that
I'm going to personally

12:16.703 --> 12:18.103
go over all
the evidence.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.537
I'd hate to think
there's someone in town

12:19.539 --> 12:20.605
who's out to get you.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.173
Hey, Joe, they said
it was an accident.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.842
Roll away.
No, I'm just saying,

12:23.844 --> 12:25.443
as your friend, I
wouldn't feel right

12:25.445 --> 12:27.278
unless I left no
stone unturned.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.114
Geez, Joe, let it go.

12:29.116 --> 12:32.016
Yeah, Joe, even Robocop
took a day off once in a while.

12:33.552 --> 12:36.287
(phone ringing)

12:36.289 --> 12:37.355
Nope.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.857
(turns ringer off)

12:41.961 --> 12:44.362
I don't like Joe sticking
his nose into this.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.997
Maybe this was all
a big mistake.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.365
You're damn right it was.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.167
Why did I ever
agree to do this?

12:49.169 --> 12:50.368
This isn't who I am.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.670
I looked in the mirror
this morning, and it was like

12:52.672 --> 12:54.806
I was looking at a man
I'd never seen before.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.174
Hi.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.976
Scott Bakula.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.310
Just take it easy, Quagmire.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.712
There's nothing to worry about.

13:00.714 --> 13:02.347
(knocking)
JOE: Hey, it's Joe, open up.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.414
(all gasp)

13:04.383 --> 13:06.017
Uh, hey, Joe.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.018
What's going on?

13:07.020 --> 13:08.520
Oh, hey, I forgot,
I brought you guys

13:08.522 --> 13:10.455
souvenirs from
my trip to Vegas.

13:10.457 --> 13:14.626
They're T-shirts that say
"I lost my shirt in Lost Wages."

13:14.628 --> 13:17.695
(laughing)

13:26.272 --> 13:28.273
I think maybe
you should keep them.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.974
All right,
I'll see you guys later.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.977
I got to go see the forensics
team about the pharmacy.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.979
Don't you worry, Mort.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.715
We'll get to the bottom of this.

13:37.717 --> 13:38.983
I don't like
this, you guys.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.185
This is bad.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.986
Joe's gonna find out,
I just know it.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.588
Jeez, Quagmire,
you need to relax.

13:43.590 --> 13:44.956
And I know
how to help.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.091
Calgon,
take him away.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.160
(harp arpeggio)

13:54.266 --> 13:56.034
QUAGMIRE : This is
worse, Peter!

13:56.036 --> 13:58.303
Relax, this is supposed
to be <i>your</i> time.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.839
This is the right way to
deal with your problems.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.977
All right, guys,
if Joe really is nosing around,

14:05.979 --> 14:09.314
I think I know how to get him
off the case once and for all.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.515
(dialing)

14:10.517 --> 14:11.850
JOE: Hello?

14:11.852 --> 14:13.952
Officer Swanson,
this is the chief of police.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.119
I'm afraid
you're fired.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.789
I see. Well,
that's too bad.

14:17.791 --> 14:18.990
I was looking forward

14:18.992 --> 14:21.526
to giving you
your birthday present next week.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.094
Oh.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.262
Apparently,
there was a mistake.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.530
Forget I called.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.099
Guys, I got to become chief
of police by next week.

14:30.269 --> 14:33.705
Chief, this just came in
for you from Officer Swanson.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.275
A Starbucks gift card?!

14:37.277 --> 14:40.011
This has been
an unproductive use of my time.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.281
Okay, I got it.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.316
Joe can't investigate
if he's distracted, right?

14:45.318 --> 14:48.653
Well, what's more distracting
than texts about dinner plans?

14:48.655 --> 14:51.756
Hmm. These burn ignition
patterns aren't consistent

14:51.758 --> 14:53.758
with an electrical fire.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.760
(phone chirps)

14:55.762 --> 14:57.762
"Would... love to."

14:57.764 --> 14:59.831
(phone chirps)

14:59.833 --> 15:05.870
"Probably...
about 7:00... or 7:30."

15:07.306 --> 15:09.440
(phone chirps, Joe sighs)

15:09.442 --> 15:11.476
"Any... of...

15:11.478 --> 15:14.345
those places would be... fine."

15:14.347 --> 15:16.047
(phone chirps)

15:16.049 --> 15:18.549
God, no way!

15:18.551 --> 15:20.385
"I don't know.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.621
"Probably just
a collared shirt

15:23.623 --> 15:25.623
"and jeans.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.825
"Have you never been

15:27.827 --> 15:31.763
to... a restaurant before?"

15:31.765 --> 15:33.031
Oh, he's getting annoyed.
Look at that.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.800
He sure is. Okay, now
tell him you want a vegan place.

15:35.802 --> 15:36.935
(phone ringing)

15:36.937 --> 15:38.836
Oh, my God,
he's so pissed, he's calling.

15:38.838 --> 15:40.104
Well, answer it.
No, no, no.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.173
I'm gonna send it to voicemail,
then call him back,

15:42.175 --> 15:44.042
but pocket-dial him
while I walk a few blocks.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.044
JOE (muffled,
from Peter's phone) : Peter?

15:46.046 --> 15:47.979
Peter? Hello?

15:47.981 --> 15:50.581
I'm getting
very little work done!

15:53.786 --> 15:55.653
You guys, I just can't
take this anymore.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.755
I've been giving it
a lot of thought,

15:57.757 --> 15:59.624
and I think
we all just need to confess.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.159
What? Now just
hold on, Quagmire.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.794
If you start yapping
to the cops,

16:02.796 --> 16:05.263
we're gonna rot in prison
for the next 30 years.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.464
JOE:
Evening, gentlemen.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.799
(all gasp)
Joe!

16:07.801 --> 16:09.167
Glad I found
you here.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.436
I had a question
for you guys.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.771
Did any of you happen
to be at Mort's pharmacy

16:13.773 --> 16:14.973
on the night of the fire?

16:14.975 --> 16:16.307
No.
None
of us were.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.443
I'm triplets. Could have
been one of my triplets.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.511
I see. Well, then
it's kind of peculiar

16:20.513 --> 16:21.946
that I would
find this.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.781
A pocket-dial
voicemail from Peter

16:23.783 --> 16:25.650
on the night
of the fire.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.820
PETER:
Oh, my God, look at that fire
we started, Quagmire and Mort.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.822
You know
who I don't miss is Joe.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.257
That's a piece of evidence
that hurts all of us.

16:33.259 --> 16:36.194
You three are under arrest for
burning down Goldman's Pharmacy.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.764
Well, the pocket-dial giveth,
and the pocket-dial taketh away.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.265
You'll never take me alive!

16:41.267 --> 16:42.934
Aren't you gonna run?

16:42.936 --> 16:46.137
I would, but I don't want
my gym teacher to laugh at me.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.639
He's been following me around
since junior high.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.842
Watch this.
Watch this Jewish kid run.

16:57.049 --> 16:59.217
First, I have to read you
the Miranda rights

16:59.219 --> 17:00.718
for Jewish people.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.154
You have the right to remain
silent, even though you won't.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.923
You have the right to infer an
insult where none was intended.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.425
What's that
supposed to mean?

17:07.427 --> 17:10.328
You have the right to a lawyer,
who you are probably related to.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.863
This interview
is over.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.433
What were you doing the night
of March 8th?

17:15.435 --> 17:16.834
(Bleep) your mother.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.136
Come on, man,
that's not cool.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.371
Oh, yeah? Maybe this
is cool enough for you.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.340
(passing wind)

17:22.342 --> 17:23.341
(blows)

17:23.343 --> 17:24.942
It's gonna take
a lot more

17:24.944 --> 17:27.345
than a fart in my
face to make me...

17:27.347 --> 17:28.980
Whoa! Whoa.

17:28.982 --> 17:31.015
Yeah, and there's more
where that came from.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.184
(straining)

17:33.186 --> 17:34.852
(sighs)
No, there isn't.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.622
Where were you
the night of the fire?

17:37.624 --> 17:39.824
I was at the movies.
What did you see?

17:39.826 --> 17:41.125
<i>No Strings Attached.</i>
<i>How was it?</i>

17:41.127 --> 17:43.628
Sucked.
Okay, that checks out.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.130
Boy, that Ashton Kutcher
sure was a cad

17:46.132 --> 17:47.665
in that movie, wasn't he?

17:47.667 --> 17:48.800
Yeah, totally.

17:48.802 --> 17:50.601
Wrong! He had
a heart of gold.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.103
You're going down.

17:55.207 --> 17:57.508
Your husband's
in here, ma'am.
Lois!

17:57.510 --> 17:58.810
Peter, what's going on?

17:58.812 --> 18:01.379
Is it true? Did you really
burn down Mort's pharmacy?

18:01.381 --> 18:02.814
Hi, Lois. Hi.

18:02.816 --> 18:04.982
Look, Lois, we
were just trying
to help Mort.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.452
Peter, how could you do this?
You have a family.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.287
Did you ever stop
to think about us

18:09.289 --> 18:11.756
before you did something that
could send you away to prison?

18:11.758 --> 18:15.593
(sighs)
For once, could you visit me
in jail and not criticize me?

18:15.595 --> 18:16.828
Wait a minute.

18:16.830 --> 18:19.097
This isn't Carvel,
you lying bitch.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.331
All right,
that's enough.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.100
Visiting time
is over.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.435
You know you guys are
gonna do time for this.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.504
Come on, Joe. You're really
gonna put us away?

18:26.506 --> 18:27.972
You think I
want to do this?

18:27.974 --> 18:30.942
You know how hard it's gonna be
for me to make new friends?

18:30.944 --> 18:33.811
Hey, do you think Chris is
old enough to be my friend?

18:33.813 --> 18:35.847
Old enough? Yes. But I wouldn't
bark down that alley.

18:35.849 --> 18:37.448
You frighten him.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.684
He thinks you're a Transformer
that broke halfway through.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.686
I get that a lot.
I understand.

18:41.688 --> 18:42.753
Look, Mort was
in trouble.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.822
We-we were just trying
to help him out.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.325
Well, insurance fraud is not
the way to help somebody out.

18:47.327 --> 18:50.194
Listen, Joe, insurance agencies
are all scumbags.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.662
They deserve to get hurt.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.864
You don't decide that.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.699
What you did is
against the law.

18:54.701 --> 18:55.666
It's easy for you, Joe.

18:55.668 --> 18:56.868
You don't know what it's like

18:56.870 --> 18:58.636
to be screwed over
by an insurance company.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.338
Oh, I don't, do I?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.974
Well, let me tell you
a little story.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.776
It was hours after my accident.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.112
<i>I was barely conscious</i>
<i>on the operating table,</i>

19:08.114 --> 19:11.115
but I'll never forget the phone
<i>call that changed my life.</i>

19:11.117 --> 19:14.819
Hello, I'm calling on behalf of
your policyholder, Joe Swanson.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.821
He's badly injured his spine.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.656
Well, there's
a new procedure that,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.258
if administered immediately,

19:20.260 --> 19:22.326
should restore
his ability to walk.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.795
$200,000.

19:24.797 --> 19:27.532
We also have a wheelchair.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.767
$60.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.802
Okay.

19:31.804 --> 19:34.205
They're going with "B."

19:34.207 --> 19:36.641
Those sons of bitches
made it about money.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.676
Yeah, Joe.
So, what do you say?

19:38.678 --> 19:40.044
They didn't
care about you.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.712
Why should you
care about them?

19:41.714 --> 19:43.814
The thing is,

19:43.816 --> 19:45.816
you guys committed a crime,

19:45.818 --> 19:48.519
and I've still got the evidence
to prove it.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.921
Too bad I lost it.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.856
FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
Message deleted.

19:51.858 --> 19:55.193
Was that... was that supposed
to mean something?

19:55.195 --> 19:56.994
Yeah, I'm letting
you guys go.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.663
Oh. Oh, well,
that's great.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.031
Yeah, I didn't
get that, either.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.632
Yeah, why didn't you
just say that?

20:01.634 --> 20:03.701
I'm starting to regret
erasing that message.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.802
Too late, butt-face.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.771
Have a great summer, Joe.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.643
Peter, I don't
understand

20:12.645 --> 20:14.779
how they just
let you out of jail.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.114
Yeah, Joe had all kinds of
evidence against you guys.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.983
Seems like a huge
miscarriage of justice.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.785
I thought if you do
something wrong,

20:20.787 --> 20:22.353
you're supposed
to get punished.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.288
(laughing):
Oh, Chris, not if you're white.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.657
Well, now that I've wrapped
things up with you guys,

20:26.659 --> 20:29.427
I better wrap things up
with my basement family.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.195
Well, did you guys
learn your lesson

20:31.197 --> 20:32.730
about eating
uncooked antelope?

20:33.999 --> 20:35.833
(hisses)

20:39.204 --> 20:43.274
