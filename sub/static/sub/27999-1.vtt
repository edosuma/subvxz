and you have the rest of the week
to do your own chorin's.

inside of two townships

04:39.363 --> 04:42.115
and I'm gonna prove it
by starting my own call‐in show.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.450
‐ Well, time's a bit tight here,

04:43.450 --> 04:44.868
so maybe just do it after ours?

04:44.868 --> 04:46.161

04:51.458 --> 04:53.001
your studio's a bit of a holler.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.462
‐ Okay. It's one thing when I say it,
but I don't love it when you say it.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.422
‐ It beats the Franks D'Angelo shows.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.049
‐ Nothing beats <i>Jonovision.</i>

04:59.049 --> 05:01.176

‐ Wayne!

05:01.176 --> 05:04.304
You are lookin' cuter
than a little beaver pup today.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.681
‐ Beaver pups are called kits.

05:05.681 --> 05:08.100
‐ McMurray, why don't you go
back to the green room

05:08.100 --> 05:10.477
so I can let Wayne here get processed
through hair and make‐up?

05:10.477 --> 05:11.353
‐ Pass.

05:11.353 --> 05:14.481

to add some contours to my cheekbones.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.316
‐ And wardrobe.
‐ I'm already in it.

05:16.316 --> 05:20.779

in his barn clothes!

05:20.779 --> 05:22.823
‐ I am as God made me.
‐ Yes!

05:23.073 --> 05:24.491
I, McMurray,

05:24.491 --> 05:26.869
shall wait in the green room
like a professional.

05:26.869 --> 05:29.746
‐ McMurray, also, I think you might need
a little bit of wardrobe processing, too,

05:29.746 --> 05:32.374
'cause I'm not sure what happened
but your shirt shrunk.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.792
And you know what, it's distracting me.

05:33.792 --> 05:34.793
Pop it right off.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.090
‐ Oh!

05:40.090 --> 05:41.717
Why don't youse hang around
after your show

05:41.717 --> 05:44.303
to watch my show to see how
a real pro does a call‐in show?

05:44.303 --> 05:45.846
‐ Why don't you say "show" again?

05:45.846 --> 05:48.015
‐ Hope you packed
some showmanship, Wayne.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.850
‐ Atta boy.
‐ Now, Wayne, admittedly,

05:49.850 --> 05:53.228
I do not know a whole heck of a lot
about a call‐in show,

05:53.228 --> 05:55.522
but it strikes me that it is complicated.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.940
‐ No, it isn't.
‐ It isn't?

05:56.940 --> 06:00.027
‐ People call in with their questions,
and then you answer them.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.237
‐ Ooh, stripped down.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.947
Bare‐bones. I like it.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.325
Speaking of stripping and bones,
why don't you pop that shirt right off?

06:06.325 --> 06:08.785
‐ Katy, can you help us
screen callers for nut sacks?

06:08.785 --> 06:10.454
‐ That's a Texas size 10‐4.

06:10.454 --> 06:13.999

06:13.999 --> 06:16.460

06:18.128 --> 06:21.715
to see how a real professional
respects his audience.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.259
‐ All right, McMurray. Less talk,
and more popping that shirt off. Go away.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.969
McMURRAY: Can't work
under these conditions.

‐ Why don't we just dig out
our Lilith Fair CDs

07:20.148 --> 07:23.360
and calm the crowd with
a vintage set of ecto‐folk.

07:23.360 --> 07:27.364

and rip into some Midwestern fidget juke?

She's a bit of a cow.

07:39.835 --> 07:41.503

‐ No.

07:41.503 --> 07:45.424
Okay. I've got a shirtless Mr. McMurray
in the green room who has agreed,

very generously,

07:46.800 --> 07:49.428

We don't have time for any of it. Okay.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.398
I need to go take some stills

you get a four‐step

Hang up, preacher!

16:08.635 --> 16:10.345

‐ Fuck you, fuck youse. Next...

16:12.598 --> 16:14.474

CALLER 4:

16:15.809 --> 16:17.144
<i>I was jerking off to your wife right now.</i>

16:17.144 --> 16:18.520
<i>If you could help me</i>
<i>cross the finish line,</i>

16:18.520 --> 16:19.771
<i>how does your wife orgasm?</i>

16:19.771 --> 16:21.356
<i>Is it like a high‐pitched squeal</i>

16:21.356 --> 16:23.984
<i>or is it more like a</i> [groans]
<i>a low groan? And, thanks, buddy.</i>

16:23.984 --> 16:26.403
‐ I'm gonna make you
squeal like a pig

16:26.403 --> 16:28.488
in a positraction El Camino!

16:29.323 --> 16:31.575
‐ Oh, no! Hands off Iggy's Azaleas!

<i>♪ Hey Willy, hey Willy ♪</i>

16:39.416 --> 16:41.502
‐ Fuck that shit.

16:41.502 --> 16:43.420
‐ Fuckin' I'm kinda looking
forward to the next one.

16:43.420 --> 16:44.463
That was a good time today.

16:44.463 --> 16:45.839
‐ Well, it was a real good time.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.716
‐ It was a great time.
‐ I should say, good buddies.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.968
‐ Now, are you sure you won't
reconsider the theme song?

16:49.968 --> 16:51.845
I've got rare, a big beat Christmas

16:51.845 --> 16:54.640
crunk Record Store Day‐only
seven‐inch from Discogs.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.391
‐ Do you mean Disco Gs?
‐ [hisses]

16:56.391 --> 16:57.726
‐ I think we're sorted.

16:57.726 --> 17:00.896
‐ How about new age abstract
gangsta big band?

17:00.896 --> 17:03.357
‐ NuSkool old wave downbeat rock‐a‐booty?

17:03.357 --> 17:05.234
‐ Shut the fuck up!

17:05.234 --> 17:07.444
‐ So, you enjoying your
engagement party there, good buddy?

17:07.444 --> 17:09.655
‐ Looks more like a stump burn
to me, good buddy.

17:09.655 --> 17:11.657
‐ Well, we're all heres
'cause youse gots engaged.

17:11.657 --> 17:14.743
‐ Well, I'm here because we got
a big fuck‐off stump to burn.

17:15.244 --> 17:16.537
‐ More to that, buddy.

17:16.537 --> 17:18.664
‐ He's not your buddy.

17:18.664 --> 17:20.624
‐ Well, seeing as marriage
is complicated...

17:20.624 --> 17:21.917
‐ No, it isn't.
‐ It isn't?

17:21.917 --> 17:24.545
‐ You decide you're gonna spend
the rest of your life with someone,

17:24.545 --> 17:26.129
and then you do it.

17:26.129 --> 17:27.756
‐ What I think he's trying to say is

17:27.756 --> 17:30.717
you can only smash one woman
for the rest of your life.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.427
‐ Hence the decision
to make her his wifes.

17:32.427 --> 17:34.721
‐ For life.
‐ It's a super important concern, bro.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.598
‐ Thanks, bro.
‐ [bottles clink]

17:36.598 --> 17:40.477
‐ But my question was
more along the lines of,

17:40.477 --> 17:43.772
could we now try and smash babes
that you've already smashed?

17:45.566 --> 17:46.984
Because, I mean, we know the code, bro.

17:46.984 --> 17:48.068
‐ He's not your bro.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.112
‐ Oh, yeah. If you wanna
talk code, we know it, boys.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.488
‐ Yeah, and name one person

17:51.488 --> 17:53.782
who knows the code better than us.

17:53.782 --> 17:54.867
Yeah, go ahead, I'll wait.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.577
‐ Why don't you say "code" again, bud.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.245
‐ More like Pearl Jam's <i>No Code.</i>

17:58.245 --> 18:00.873
‐ Atta boy.
‐ What's bro code?

18:00.873 --> 18:04.751
‐ The bro code is
you never smash a bro's girlfriend...

18:04.751 --> 18:06.378
‐ Or ex‐girlfriend.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.130
But that's only bro code‐ish.

18:09.173 --> 18:10.841
‐ And I think that's it.
‐ Yeah, that's it.

18:10.841 --> 18:12.301
‐ Don't make any sense.

18:12.301 --> 18:14.720
‐ But seeing as you've now
hung them up permanently...

18:14.720 --> 18:16.805
‐ I would philander with Tanis so fast.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.682
‐ You couldn't wheel Tanis, you pylon.

18:18.682 --> 18:20.684
‐ Buddy, you couldn't wheel
a fuckin' tire down a hill.

18:20.684 --> 18:22.186
‐ You haven't seen his dick.

18:22.186 --> 18:23.395
‐ Neither have you.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.480
‐ You'll just have to
take that up with Tanis.

18:26.064 --> 18:28.025
‐ So, what about the...

18:28.025 --> 18:29.568
‐ Angie who?

18:29.568 --> 18:31.695
‐ Sick, buddy. I'd love to smash her.

18:31.695 --> 18:32.821
‐ Sick, boys.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.448
I'll see if she wants
to smash right after this.

18:34.448 --> 18:35.699
REILLY: Yeah.
‐ [Jonesy chuckles]

18:35.699 --> 18:37.242
‐ So, I guess that leaves, uh...

18:37.242 --> 18:40.954
‐ Rosie. Rosie O'Donnell was
on <i>Howard Stern</i> the other day

18:40.954 --> 18:42.539
and she's a damn good interview.

18:42.539 --> 18:44.208
‐ Well, everybody's good on <i>Stern.</i>

18:44.208 --> 18:46.376
GAIL: Couldn't help
but catch a bit of the convo.

18:46.376 --> 18:49.087
Just 'cause you're married
doesn't mean you can't

18:49.087 --> 18:51.298
smash a whole bunch of people.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.342
McMURRAY:
I can confirm.

18:53.342 --> 18:55.010
MARIE‐FRED:
Hell of an engagement party.

18:55.010 --> 18:56.094
<i>Merci.</i>

18:56.094 --> 18:57.596
‐ Looks more like a stump burn to me.

18:57.596 --> 19:00.098
‐ Big brother, we're all here
for your engagement.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.475
‐ Well, I'm here because we got a...

19:01.475 --> 19:04.019

KATY: Oh, yeah?

19:05.979 --> 19:07.481
You like Puppers?
‐ Yeah, I like Puppers.

19:07.481 --> 19:09.316
‐ You like Gus 'n Bru?
‐ I like Gus 'n Bru.

19:09.316 --> 19:12.611
‐ Well, let's raise a glass.

19:14.571 --> 19:19.326
To Marie‐Fred and Wayne
settling down, as they say.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.286
‐ Droppin' anchor.
‐ Without a doubtin' it.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.996
‐ It's a life‐o‐suction, buddy.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.414
‐ Bending over backwards, boys.

19:24.414 --> 19:25.666
‐ Ignoring statistics.

19:25.666 --> 19:27.543
‐ [crying] Becoming one!

19:27.543 --> 19:29.378
‐ You must consummate the marriage!

19:29.378 --> 19:32.005
‐ Hear, hear!
‐ [bottles clinking]

19:32.005 --> 19:35.133
GLEN: Oh! Oh, no! Am I late
for the engagement party?

19:35.133 --> 19:36.677
‐ It's a stump burn.

19:36.677 --> 19:39.471
‐ You must consummate the marriage.

19:39.471 --> 19:40.639
‐ Yeah, we covered that.

19:40.639 --> 19:42.724
‐ Well, thanks for coming, everybody.

19:42.724 --> 19:43.851
Let's get fuckin' hammered.

19:46.061 --> 19:48.438
[no audible dialogue]

19:48.438 --> 19:50.190
DAN: I, uh...

19:50.190 --> 19:52.860
I brought a little bits of aviation fuel
for the occasion.

19:52.860 --> 19:53.735
‐ Oh!

19:53.735 --> 19:55.654
‐ We throw some aviation fuel
on the cocksucker?

19:55.654 --> 19:57.155
‐ Fuckin' I'm surprised we're not puttin'

19:57.155 --> 19:58.824
aviation fuel on the cocksucker
right now!

20:00.367 --> 20:02.411
‐ Let's get fucking reckless, boys.
