03:50.404 --> 03:52.536
WHY DUMP A BODY

THE MUSEUM DOESN'T HAVE

YOU CAN SNEAK A BODY OUT OF.

THAT'S GREAT.

09:04.892 --> 09:06.850
YEAH. A MONTH IN L.A.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.678
I'LL BE STARING AT A COMPUTER
SCREEN THE WHOLE TIME,

09:08.722 --> 09:10.027
BUT STILL.

09:10.071 --> 09:11.551
THE TEAM'S GONNA MISS YOU.

09:11.594 --> 09:13.030
You said you'd talk
to Bertram

09:13.074 --> 09:14.684
ABOUT THE STIPEND REQUEST.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.686
THE DEPOSIT'S DUE IN TWO DAYS.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.558
I'LL SWING BY ON MY WAY BACK.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.690
THANKS, BOSS.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.040
IT'S CALLED WHITE HAT.

09:23.084 --> 09:25.695
IT'S AN ADVANCED COMPUTER
INVESTIGATION TRAINING PROGRAM

09:25.739 --> 09:27.218
TAUGHT BY ACTUAL HACKERS.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.698
IT'S SO ADVANCED,
I DON'T KNOW

09:28.742 --> 09:30.570
WHAT SHE'S SAYING
WHEN SHE TALKS ABOUT IT.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.049
UH-HUH.

09:32.093 --> 09:35.400
I'D LIKE TO RUSH A REQUEST
FOR A TRAINING STIPEND

09:35.444 --> 09:36.706
TO COVER THE COSTS.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.708
YOU THINK MANCHESTER'S
BEEN CHEATING?

09:38.752 --> 09:40.580
WHAT?AT POKER.

09:40.623 --> 09:41.711
NO.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.583
WELL, HE'S JUST
S-SO DAMN SMUG.

09:43.626 --> 09:46.411
YOU KNOW, "GOODNIGHT MOON,"
HE SAYS--

09:46.455 --> 09:47.587
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

09:47.630 --> 09:49.414
IT'S JUST A GAME.

09:49.458 --> 09:50.590
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

09:52.766 --> 09:53.854
SIR...

09:53.897 --> 09:57.422
NO--OH, WHAT WAS THAT
ABOUT VAN PELT?

09:57.466 --> 09:59.729
HER TRAINING STIPEND.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.601
TIMES ARE TIGHT.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.907
WE'VE CUT ALL OUTSIDE
TRAINING FUNDS FROM THE BUDGET.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.474
NO, REQUEST DENIED.

10:12.481 --> 10:13.613
HEY.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.920
LISBON SAID SHE LOST YOU.

10:16.964 --> 10:19.749
WELL, I COME BEARING GIFTS.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.446
GRACE.

10:21.490 --> 10:24.754
JELLY DINOSAURS
ARE FOR ME...

10:24.798 --> 10:26.930
FOR LATER.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.758
AND...

10:28.802 --> 10:32.109
I'M GUESSING YOU'RE
A TRICERATOPS MAN.YEAH.

10:32.153 --> 10:34.764
RIGSBY IS A T. REX.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.766
ANY NEWS ON THE CASE?

10:36.810 --> 10:38.942
YEAH, THE VICTIM'S EX-BOYFRIEND
IS AN S.F.P.D. BEAT COP.

10:38.986 --> 10:40.770
HE'S ON PATROL RIGHT NOW.
I WAS JUST GONNA GO TALK TO HIM.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.642
ON THE STREETS?YEAH.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.644
LET'S GO. I HAVEN'T BEEN
ON THE STREETS FOR A WHILE.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.820
[claps hands]LET'S DO IT.

10:48.517 --> 10:50.650
COME ON.THANKS?

10:50.693 --> 10:52.956
I DON'T KNOW.
HE WAS LIKE, UH, 5'6".

10:53.000 --> 10:55.132
NOT FAT, REALLY.
JUST A BIG FACE.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.699
BROWN HAIR.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.788
HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A GUN.
WHY'D YOU GIVE HIM THE MONEY?

10:58.832 --> 11:01.138
I DIDN'T GIVE ITTO HIM,
HE TOOK IT!

11:01.182 --> 11:03.663
WHAT WAS HE DRESSED LIKE,
THIS GUY?

11:03.706 --> 11:05.490
YOU GUYS FROM CBI?

11:05.534 --> 11:06.970
AGENT CHO.
THIS IS PATRICK JANE.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.668
UH, LOOK, I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU GUYS,

11:08.711 --> 11:09.973
BUT WE GOTTA HANDLE THIS,
OKAY?

11:10.017 --> 11:11.322
LET ME CATCH UP WITH YOU
IN A COUPLE HOURS.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.673
A COUPLE HOURS?YEAH, WE JUST GOT THIS.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.152
I MEAN, WE GOTTA PUT OUT
A CRIME BROADCAST.

11:15.196 --> 11:16.806
WE GOTTA CRUISE
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.503
THEN THERE'S THE PAPERWORK.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.984
WELL, CAN'T HELP YOU
WITH THE PAPERWORK.

11:21.028 --> 11:22.812
HE HAD A HOOD.
HE CAME IN--WHY'D YOU GIVE HIM THE MONEY?

11:22.856 --> 11:24.684
SIR, WE'RE ASKING
THE QUESTIONS HERE.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.686
JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

11:26.729 --> 11:29.514
SO THIS DUDE COMES UP WHILE
I'M CASHING OUT THE REGISTER,

11:29.558 --> 11:31.516
ASKS FOR A CALLING CARD.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.518
I JUST TURNED FOR ONE SECOND,

11:33.562 --> 11:35.695
AND HE REACHED THROUGH THE GAP
AND GRABBED A STACK OF $20s.

11:35.738 --> 11:38.698
YOU WAIT UNTIL YOU'RE
FINISHED CASHING OUT

11:38.741 --> 11:40.003
BEFORE YOU DO
ANOTHER TRANSACTION!

11:40.047 --> 11:41.701
LOOK, THE GUY HAD MONEY.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.180
HE DIDN'T LOOK SHADY
OR ANYTHING.

11:43.224 --> 11:44.704
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW?

11:44.747 --> 11:46.009
HEY. EXCUSE ME.

11:46.053 --> 11:48.577
SHOW ME HOW HE REACHED
THROUGH THE GAP AGAIN.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.540
ALL RIGHT.
PULL YOUR HAND OUT.

11:55.584 --> 11:57.717
[thuds]HUH?

11:57.760 --> 12:00.371
THAT'S HOW THEY CATCH
A RACCOON, YOU KNOW THAT?

12:00.415 --> 12:02.852
SO THE GUY COULDN'T HAVE GRABBED
THE CASH THROUGH THE GAP.

12:02.896 --> 12:05.202
THERE WASN'T ANOTHER GUY,
WAS THERE, BUDDY?

12:05.246 --> 12:07.552
YOU! YOU'RE THE THIEF!

12:07.596 --> 12:08.728
I'M THE THIEF?

12:08.771 --> 12:10.033
YOU'RE THE THIEF.[groans]

12:10.077 --> 12:12.035
WITH WHAT YOU'RE PAYING ME,
I'M THE THIEF?

12:12.079 --> 12:13.733
WORK'S DONE HERE,
BUDDY.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.909
I THINK YOU CAN GET YOUR MAN
TO DO THE PAPERWORK.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.215
LOOK--

12:18.259 --> 12:19.216
NO, NO, NO.

12:22.437 --> 12:23.873
WHEN DID YOU
AND LINDA MEET?

12:23.917 --> 12:25.745
LAST YEAR.
I WAS MOONLIGHTING,

12:25.788 --> 12:26.876
DOING SECURITY AT THE MUSEUM.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.225
AND HOW WAS
THE RELATIONSHIP?

12:28.269 --> 12:29.879
[exhales]

12:29.923 --> 12:32.229
HER LIFE WAS MORE TOGETHER
THAN ANYBODY I EVER MET.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.883
SHE WAS SO FOCUSED.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.406
GOT TO ME, TOO, I GUESS.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.234
I EVEN STARTED STUDYING
FOR THE SERGEANT'S EXAM.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.758
MM-HMM. AND THEN
YOU DUMPED HER?

12:38.801 --> 12:41.064
YOU THINK I WAS HAPPY
ABOUT IT?YOU TELL ME.

12:41.108 --> 12:43.240
ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO I GOT
AN ANONYMOUS E-MAIL

12:43.284 --> 12:44.764
WITH A LINK IN IT

12:44.807 --> 12:47.244
TO HER ONLINE DATING
PROFILE.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.768
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.900
AND SHE'D STARTED
SEEING OTHER PEOPLE?

12:50.944 --> 12:53.076
I... I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE STARTED.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.599
SHE WAS JUST SHOPPING AROUND.

12:54.643 --> 12:55.905
MAYBE SHE'D BEEN DOING IT
THE WHOLE TIME.

12:55.949 --> 12:58.255
YOU TALK TO HER ABOUT IT?YEAH.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.910
BIG FIGHT.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.607
YOU GET ROUGH WITH HER?

13:02.651 --> 13:05.785
MNH. I DON'T HAVE THAT
IN ME.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.917
HURT A WOMAN?
ESPECIALLY NOT LINDA.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.789
SHE HAVE AN EXPLANATION?[scoffs]

13:09.832 --> 13:13.270
SHE DENIED IT, YOU KNOW,
BUT WHAT ELSE WAS SHE GONNA DO?

13:13.314 --> 13:15.272
I CAN'T TAKE CHEATING.
I HAD TO LET HER GO.

13:15.316 --> 13:17.448
MM-HMM. DID YOU KNOW
WHO SENT YOU THE PROFILE?

13:17.492 --> 13:19.624
NO.AND YOU WEREN'T CURIOUS?

13:19.668 --> 13:21.278
I DON'T KNOW. I...

13:21.322 --> 13:23.628
SOME GUY'S GIRLFRIEND'S
IN THE SAME BOAT AS ME,

13:23.672 --> 13:25.630
SOMEBODY'S HOLDING A GRUDGE.

13:25.674 --> 13:28.285
ONLY THING THAT MATTERED
WAS I WASN'T ENOUGH FOR HER.

13:28.329 --> 13:29.939
AND AFTER YOU BROKE UP,
YOU NEVER SPOKE TO HER AGAIN?

13:29.983 --> 13:31.941
NO.

13:31.985 --> 13:34.117
[scoffs]

13:34.161 --> 13:35.945
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.817
YOU KNOW, SHE HAD SMARTS.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.471
SHE WAS GONNA HAVE
A BIG LIFE.

13:40.515 --> 13:43.474
WHAT'D SHE WANT
WITH A MOOK LIKE ME, RIGHT?

13:43.518 --> 13:45.346
[scoffs]

13:47.000 --> 13:48.305
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING?

13:48.349 --> 13:50.481
HERE'S THE DATING PROFILE
SOMEBODY SENT MORAN.

13:50.525 --> 13:51.961
[typing and clicks mouse]

13:52.005 --> 13:53.310
GET A HOLD
OF THE DATING SITE.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.138
SEE IF ANYBODY CONTACTED HER

13:55.182 --> 13:56.661
AROUND THE TIME
SHE WENT MISSING.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.315
I DON'T THINK LINDA
WENT ON ANY DATES.

13:58.359 --> 13:59.664
WELL, WHY NOT?

13:59.708 --> 14:01.971
THE ADDRESS THAT SENT MORAN
THE E-MAIL WAS USED

14:02.015 --> 14:04.844
TO SET UP AN ACCOUNT
WITH THE DATING SITE.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.323
DID YOU FIND THEM?

14:06.367 --> 14:08.848
SORT OF. I LOGGED
INTO THE ACCOUNT.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.675
DON'T YOU NEED A PASSWORD
FOR THAT?

14:10.719 --> 14:13.156
I SPENT TWO MINUTES USING
THE MOST COMMON PASSWORDS.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.331
IT WAS "QWERTY."

14:14.375 --> 14:15.680
"QWERTY"?

14:15.724 --> 14:17.508
Q-W-E-R-T-Y.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.989
IT'S THE FIFTH MOST
COMMON PASSWORD.

14:20.033 --> 14:20.990
GUESS WHOSE PROFILE IT WAS.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.687
LINDA.

14:22.731 --> 14:26.343
SO WHOEVER SENT MORAN
THE PROFILE ALSO CREATED IT.

14:26.387 --> 14:27.867
YEP. PROFILE'S A FAKE.

14:27.910 --> 14:31.522
SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO BREAK UP
LINDA AND OFFICER MORAN.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.698
NICE WORK.MM.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.700
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED

14:35.744 --> 14:36.876
ABOUT THE TRAINING PROGRAM.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.878
WE'LL GET YOU IN NEXT YEAR.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.053
IT'S FINE.

14:41.402 --> 14:44.361
[clicks mouse and typing]

14:44.405 --> 14:47.016
BERTRAM'S SUPPOSED TO BE
THIS REAL SMOOTH PLAYER,

14:47.060 --> 14:49.018
BUT HE LOSES A COUPLE
OF HANDS OF POKER

14:49.062 --> 14:50.715
AND HE HAS TO BUM
EVERYBODY ELSE OUT.

14:50.759 --> 14:54.197
LINDA WANTED "A MAN
WITH A SUPER HOT BODY."

14:54.241 --> 14:56.721
THE FAKE DATING PROFILE,
RIGHT?

14:56.765 --> 14:57.897
YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING?

14:57.940 --> 14:59.724
BERTRAM HANGING VAN PELT
OUT TO DRY.

14:59.768 --> 15:03.032
HE'S JUST MAD BECAUSE HE'S
LOSING BIG MONEY AT POKER.

15:03.076 --> 15:06.209
WELL, SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO PUSH
THEIR PAIN ONTO OTHER PEOPLE,

15:06.253 --> 15:07.907
WEAKER PEOPLE, AND THERE'S
ALWAYS SOMEONE WEAKER.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.734
THAT'S JUST
THE CIRCLE OF LIFE.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.519
CHEERY.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.913
BERTRAM DOESN'T WANTTO WIN,
LISBON, HE HASTO.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.915
IT'S WHY HE IS WHERE HE IS.

15:15.958 --> 15:19.919
THE IDEA OF LOSING IS JUST
INTOLERABLE TO HIM.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.225
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY WANT TO BREAK
LINDA AND HER BOYFRIEND UP?

15:22.269 --> 15:23.748
ROMANTIC RIVALRY?

15:23.792 --> 15:25.402
YEAH, POSSIBLY.

15:25.446 --> 15:29.058
"I'M LOOKING FOR BRAINS,
BRAWN, THE TOTAL PACKAGE."

15:29.102 --> 15:30.755
VAN PELT'S TRYING TO TRACE
THE E-MAIL,

15:30.799 --> 15:32.192
BUT SHE HIT A DEAD END.

15:32.235 --> 15:33.933
WELL, WHOEVER AUTHORED THIS
LEFT THEIR FINGERPRINTS

15:33.976 --> 15:35.412
ALL OVER IT.

15:35.456 --> 15:36.761
"NO HALF-STEPPERS.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.938
"A GENUINE BADASS.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.940
FEATHER MY NEST."

15:40.983 --> 15:42.245
GATHER THE TROOPS, LISBON.

15:42.289 --> 15:43.594
WHY?

15:43.638 --> 15:47.250
IT'S TIME TO PLAY BINGO.

15:47.294 --> 15:51.428
SO WE HAVE A LIST OF WORDS
FROM THE FAKE DATING PROFILE.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.082
WE TALK TO THE STUDENTS

15:53.126 --> 15:54.954
AND COMPARE WHAT THEY SAY
TO THE WORDS IN THE LIST,

15:54.997 --> 15:56.956
AND IF WHAT THEY SAY MATCHES UP
WITH THE WORDS ON THE LIST,

15:56.999 --> 15:59.088
THEN THEY'RE THE ONE
THAT WROTE THE PROFILE?

15:59.132 --> 16:00.611
SO FAR, SO GOOD.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.091
BUT HOW DO WE GET THEM
TO SAY THE RIGHT WORDS?

16:02.135 --> 16:03.440
WHAT DO WE ASK THEM ABOUT?

16:03.484 --> 16:05.094
YOU HAVE TO TRY TO GET
THEIR WORDS FLOWING.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.966
TALK TO THEM ABOUT
THEIR PASSIONS.THEIR PASSIONS?

16:07.009 --> 16:09.272
ANIMALS, OF COURSE.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.971
BUGS. CRITTERS.

16:12.014 --> 16:14.799
PEOPLE USE "COLDBLOODED"
TO MEAN EVIL,

16:14.843 --> 16:17.106
AS IF A SPECIES'
THERMOPHYSIOLOGY

16:17.150 --> 16:19.282
COULD DETERMINE
ITS MORAL ATTRIBUTES.

16:19.326 --> 16:20.631
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

16:20.675 --> 16:24.113
REPTILES NEVER INVENTED
THE ATOMIC BOMB.

16:24.157 --> 16:28.117
IF YOU ASK ME, WARM BLOOD
IS THE PROBLEM.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.510
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

16:35.342 --> 16:37.126
EXCUSE ME.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.302
SO... SKELETONS.

16:39.346 --> 16:40.825
WHY ARE YOU INTO THEM?

16:40.869 --> 16:42.827
WHY DO I NEED A REASON?

16:42.871 --> 16:45.134
I'LL JUST GO WITH "WEIRD."

16:45.178 --> 16:48.007
IT'S, LIKE, UNDER ALL THIS
VISCERA WE WEAR,

16:48.050 --> 16:49.834
THERE'S--WELL, THERE'S
SOMETHING STRONG

16:49.878 --> 16:52.011
AND--AND CLEAN
AND--AND BEAUTIFUL

16:52.054 --> 16:53.490
THAT--THAT HOLDS US
TOGETHER.

16:53.534 --> 16:57.016
YOU CAN'T LOSE IT.
I THINK--I THINK THAT'S COOL.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.017
[clears throat]

17:00.062 --> 17:01.846
DID I PASS?

17:01.890 --> 17:04.719
I'VE TAKEN A PSYCH TEST
BEFORE.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.512
AH. MR. JANE.

17:15.556 --> 17:18.037
WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING YOU.

17:18.080 --> 17:21.344
DEAN PAPADAKIS TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR IMPRESSIVE MEMORY.

17:21.388 --> 17:24.043
MY OWN MEMORY ISN'T AS GOOD
AS IT USED TO BE.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.044
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

17:26.915 --> 17:29.048
IT'S EASY TO REMEMBER
WHEN YOU NEVER FORGET.

17:30.223 --> 17:31.354
WHAT YOU DOING?

17:31.398 --> 17:33.878
AH. LAYING BAIT
FOR MOTHS.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.880
THEY LIKE SWEETNESS,

17:35.924 --> 17:38.057
SO I USE BROWN BANANAS
AND BEER.

17:38.100 --> 17:41.190
MMM. DELICIOUS.[chuckles]

17:41.234 --> 17:43.888
PAUL HERE DISCOVERED
A NEW SPECIES OF MOTH.

17:43.932 --> 17:45.542
THE CALIFORNIA JADE MOTH.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.196
IT'S ON DISPLAY IN OUR MUSEUM.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.068
IT'S RATHER A BIG DEAL.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.374
YEAH. NOW THERE ARE
1,500,001

17:51.418 --> 17:53.724
TYPES OF INSECTS
IN THE WORLD.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.552
WELL, THAT'S FALSE MODESTY.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.206
I GUESS SO.
IT IS A BIG DEAL.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.729
TO MOTH PEOPLE.

17:58.773 --> 18:01.080
TO ALL OF US.[chuckles]

18:01.123 --> 18:03.386
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR NEW ADDITION.

18:03.430 --> 18:06.215
THANK YOU.IT'S MOST IMPRESSIVE.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.435
THANK YOU.

18:12.134 --> 18:15.094
UH, LET ME GUESS.
YOU'RE STUDYING BUZZARDS,

18:15.137 --> 18:17.096
AND YOU'RE LAYING A TRAP
FOR ONE RIGHT NOW.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.401
AS IF.

18:18.445 --> 18:21.404
MATING HABITS
OF THE ZALOPHUS CALIFORNIANUS.

18:21.448 --> 18:22.927
SEA LIONS.

18:22.971 --> 18:25.104
ONE BADASS MALE MAINTAINING
A STABLE OF FEMALES

18:25.147 --> 18:26.931
THROUGH COMBAT.

18:26.975 --> 18:30.587
HUH. AND THAT APPEALS TO YOU?
A MAN FIGHTING FOR YOU?

18:30.631 --> 18:32.415
WHO DOESN'T WANT
AN ALPHA MALE?

18:32.459 --> 18:34.113
A GUY WHO WILL FIGHT
FOR WHAT'S HIS?

18:34.156 --> 18:36.115
YEAH. SUPER HOT.

18:36.158 --> 18:38.247
[laughs] SOUNDS EXCITING.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.249
IT'S SO COOL.
WHILE PAUL CHASES MOTHS

18:40.293 --> 18:43.252
AND JEANETTE MESSES AROUND
WITH HER LIZARDS,

18:43.296 --> 18:46.255
I HEAD OUT FOR THE ISLANDS
TO WATCH THE SEALS PLAY.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.431
I'M NOT JUST A BRAIN, SEE?

18:48.475 --> 18:50.129
I LIKE TO PLAY, TOO.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.131
I'M THE TOTAL PACKAGE.

18:52.174 --> 18:57.440
"BADASS," "SUPER HOT,"
"TOTAL PACKAGE."

18:57.484 --> 18:58.833
BINGO!

19:00.008 --> 19:07.276
WHOO! BINGO!

19:08.321 --> 19:09.800
YOU WROTE THE FAKE
DATING PROFILE

19:09.844 --> 19:10.671
THAT MADE LINDA AND HER
BOYFRIEND BREAK UP.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.455
NO LAW AGAINST IT,
IS THERE?

19:12.499 --> 19:14.283
MAYBE SHE FOUND OUT
IT WAS YOU,

19:14.327 --> 19:16.285
CONFRONTED YOU IN THE LAB,
AND THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND.

19:16.329 --> 19:19.288
LOOK--HELLO!
I DIDN'T KILL LINDA.

19:19.332 --> 19:22.161
SO WHY DID YOU WANT
TO BREAK THEM UP?

19:22.204 --> 19:23.553
[exhales]

19:23.597 --> 19:26.295
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE IN THE PROGRAM.

19:26.339 --> 19:29.298
DR. KIDD LIKES US TO PLAY
LIKE WE'RE ONE HAPPY FAMILY.

19:29.342 --> 19:32.649
WE'RE LIKE A PACK OF HYENAS
TEARING EACH OTHER APART.

19:32.693 --> 19:34.173
WHY?

19:34.216 --> 19:36.000
MONEY. WHY ELSE?[clicks pen]

19:36.044 --> 19:38.655
LOOK, THE MUSEUM DOESN'T GET
ALL THAT STUFF FOR FREE.

19:38.699 --> 19:41.658
IT NEEDS DISCOVERIES,
PUBLICITY, DONATIONS.

19:41.702 --> 19:44.661
DR. KIDD WANTS OUR PROGRAM
TO BE THE BEST.

19:44.705 --> 19:47.490
SO IF YOU AREN'T PRODUCING,
SO LONG.

19:47.534 --> 19:48.839
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

19:48.883 --> 19:51.494
YOU EVER HEARD OF
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST?

19:51.538 --> 19:53.496
'CAUSE DR. KIDD SURE HAS.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.498
SHE LIKES TO WEED OUT THE ONES
WHO CAN'T CONTRIBUTE,

19:55.542 --> 19:57.326
WHO CAN'T HACK IT.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.676
BUT NOBODY HACKS IT.
NOT REALLY.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.025
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:01.069 --> 20:03.202
JEANETTE? LIZARD GIRL?

20:03.245 --> 20:05.204
SHE HAS A SPECIAL PLACE
ON THE BACK STAIRS

20:05.247 --> 20:06.683
SHE GOES TO CRY.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.337
GREG HAD A MAJOR BREAKDOWN
LAST YEAR,

20:08.381 --> 20:10.687
LIKE THROWING RAT SKULLS
OUT THE WINDOW.

20:10.731 --> 20:14.691
AND PAUL? HE WAS CONVINCED
DR. KIDD WAS GONNA FIRE HIM

20:14.735 --> 20:17.041
UNTIL HE DISCOVERED
THAT DUMB MOTH.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.218
HOW ABOUT LINDA?
HOW DID SHE HANDLE IT?

20:19.261 --> 20:22.525
[chuckles]
SHE WAS A MACHINE.

20:22.569 --> 20:25.354
YOU'RE LOSING YOUR MIND,
AND THERE SHE IS,

20:25.398 --> 20:28.227
WORKING JUST AS HARD,
NOT EVEN BREAKING A SWEAT.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.054
MY MOM WANTED TO KILL ME

20:30.098 --> 20:32.231
FOR NOT GETTING THE DEAN'S
FELLOWSHIP.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.711
AND THEN LINDA LANDS
THAT HOT COP BOYFRIEND?

20:34.755 --> 20:36.235
HER?

20:36.278 --> 20:38.541
I MEAN...

20:38.585 --> 20:40.064
RIGHT?

20:40.108 --> 20:42.545
SO YOU MADE UP
THE FAKE DATING PROFILE

20:42.589 --> 20:44.721
TO BREAK THEM UP.

20:44.765 --> 20:46.245
[sighs]

20:46.288 --> 20:49.248
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF I COULD HURT HER.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.075
IF SHE COULD EVEN BE HURT.

20:51.119 --> 20:53.556
DID SHE KNOW IT WAS YOU?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.079
IT WRECKED HER.

20:55.123 --> 20:57.081
THE NEXT DAY SHE MESSED UP
SOMETHING STUPID,

20:57.125 --> 20:59.736
AND DR. KIDD YELLED AT HER.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.260
YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:01.303 --> 21:03.262
IT FELT REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.916
AND I KNOW THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME
SOUND LIKE A NICE PERSON.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.267
NO. NO, IT DOESN'T.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.573
[clatters]

21:10.617 --> 21:12.749
IT'S LIKE "LORD OF THE FLIES"
OVER THERE.

21:12.793 --> 21:15.404
I DIDN'T KNOW THE WORLD
OF SCIENCE WAS SO CUTTHROAT.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.580
WELL, LIKE THE MAN SAID,
ACADEMIC POLITICS

21:17.624 --> 21:19.756
CAN BE VICIOUS,
BECAUSE THE STAKES ARE SMALL.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.280
VERY SMALL, INDEED.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.282
TOMORROW MORNING WE NEED
TO GO BACK TO THE MUSEUM.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.413
WHY?

21:24.457 --> 21:25.936
EDUCATION.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.634
BUT NOW I HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING.

21:30.158 --> 21:33.292
AND THE A.G. KNOWS DAMN WELL
THE INDICTMENT WON'T STICK.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.163
UH, I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

21:36.469 --> 21:39.950
NOBODY RIDES FOR FREE.
I MEAN, HE KNOWS THAT.

21:39.994 --> 21:42.431
WHAT--WHAT, YOU CAME HERE
TO PLAY GAMES?

21:42.475 --> 21:45.304
[inhales] I HEARD
YOU'VE BEEN LOSING,

21:45.347 --> 21:48.307
AND, UH, IT'S BEEN
AFFECTING YOUR WORK.

21:49.482 --> 21:52.789
UH, I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

21:52.833 --> 21:55.444
LOOK, THE CARDS HAVEN'T BEEN
FALLING MY WAY.

21:55.488 --> 21:58.317
OH, COME ON.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.145
YOU BELIEVE IN LUCK?

22:01.189 --> 22:03.147
NO.

22:03.191 --> 22:04.845
LISBON SAYS YOU'RE
PRETTY GOOD.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.456
HMM.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.502
MARGARET, CANCEL MY 6:00.

22:16.509 --> 22:18.815
TWO PAIR.

22:18.859 --> 22:20.164
FOUR OF A KIND.

22:20.208 --> 22:21.818
SEE?

22:21.862 --> 22:23.342
I KNOW HOW TO PLAY POKER.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.473
OF COURSE YOU DO.

22:24.517 --> 22:26.475
YOU PLAY THE MAN,
NOT THE CARDS.

22:26.519 --> 22:28.347
RIGHT? I KNOW THE ODDS,
I KNOW MYSELF.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.479
YOU KNOW PEOPLE,
YOU KNOW HOW TO CONTROL THEM.

22:30.523 --> 22:32.481
NOT THAT YOU ALWAYS CARE.

22:32.525 --> 22:34.353
UH... WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

22:34.396 --> 22:36.355
WELL, YOU WIN MORE FLIES
WITH HONEY THAN WITH VINEGAR,

22:36.398 --> 22:38.487
BUT YOU USE VINEGAR ANYWAY.

22:38.531 --> 22:40.184
IS THIS ABOUT LISBON?

22:40.228 --> 22:42.186
YOU'RE VERY FOND OF
THE FAKE TELL, AREN'T YOU?

22:42.230 --> 22:45.842
BEFORE YOU BET, YOU LOOK AWAY
AND YOU BREATHE OUT VERY SLOWLY,

22:45.886 --> 22:49.368
LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO...
CALM YOURSELF.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.849
[exhales] YES.

22:52.893 --> 22:54.373
[both chuckle]

22:54.416 --> 22:56.853
WELL, YOU HAVE A TELL
INSIDE THE FAKE TELL.

22:56.897 --> 22:59.203
WHEN YOU'RE BLUFFING,

22:59.247 --> 23:01.858
THE BREATHING IS AUDIBLE.

23:01.902 --> 23:04.687
THE HELL IT IS.
I-I CONTROL MYSELF.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.385
YOU GET YOURSELF A GOOD HAND
AND PUFF AWAY LIKE THAT,

23:06.428 --> 23:09.692
MANCHESTER WILL FOR SURE
THINK YOU'RE BLUFFING.

23:09.736 --> 23:11.390
TRUST ME.

23:14.567 --> 23:17.396
[inhales and exhales]

23:17.439 --> 23:20.399
[indistinct conversations]

23:26.274 --> 23:29.059
MR. JANE.
CAN I HELP YOU?

23:29.103 --> 23:32.411
I HOPE SO. UH, YOU STILL WANT
TO LEARN MY MEMORY TRICK?

23:32.454 --> 23:34.413
I WOULD.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.415
YEAH, YOU TEACH A MASTER CLASS

23:36.458 --> 23:39.418
WITH ALL OF LINDA'S
FELLOW CLASSMATES, HUH?

23:39.461 --> 23:41.245
PAUL AND I WILL BE TEACHING IT
THIS AFTERNOON.

23:41.289 --> 23:42.899
YEAH.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.901
WELL, HOW ABOUT I PUT ON
A MEMORY SEMINAR

23:44.945 --> 23:46.425
FOR YOU AND YOUR CLASS?

23:46.468 --> 23:49.079
THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.907
BUT DON'T YOU HAVE
A MURDER TO SOLVE?

23:50.951 --> 23:52.431
EH, ALL IN GOOD TIME.

23:52.474 --> 23:53.736
UH, I'M GONNA NEED
SOME TABLES,

23:53.780 --> 23:56.086
POSSIBLY THREE OR FOUR
ACROSS THE BACK THERE.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.436
OKAY.

23:57.479 --> 23:58.741
AND, UH, LINDA'S OFFICE,

23:58.785 --> 24:01.570
IT'S FULL OF ANIMALS--
DEAD ONES.IT IS.

24:01.614 --> 24:03.920
WE'LL NEED ACCESS TO THAT,
UH, FOR PROPS.

24:03.964 --> 24:06.445
OKAY. I ASSUME... [sighs]

24:06.488 --> 24:08.447
THAT YOU HAVE SOME ULTERIOR
MOTIVE FOR ALL OF THIS.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.449
DO YOU HAVE A SUSPECT?[inhales]

24:10.492 --> 24:13.582
THERE'S ONE THING I'D LIKE YOU
TO CONFIRM FOR ME.

24:13.626 --> 24:15.062
WHAT IS THAT?

24:15.105 --> 24:18.979
JUST WHAT IS THE DIET OF
THE NORTHERN FLICKER WOODPECKER?

24:21.634 --> 24:22.765
[indistinct conversations]

24:22.809 --> 24:24.463
YEAH. SURE.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.465
HOW CAN YOU LIKE
TRICERATOPS

24:26.508 --> 24:28.292
MORE THAN...
[deep voice] T. REX?

24:28.336 --> 24:29.946
T. REX ARE LOSERS.

24:29.990 --> 24:32.775
LITTLE ARMS. IT'S A BIG
CHICKEN WITH TEETH.

24:32.819 --> 24:33.950
[normal voice] YEAH,
AND TRICERATOPS

24:33.994 --> 24:35.125
IS BASICALLY
A PIG WITH HORNS.

24:35.169 --> 24:36.605
AND A SHIELD ON ITS HEAD.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.781
BEATS A GIANT CHICKEN
ANY DAY OF THE WEEK.

24:38.825 --> 24:41.784
HA HA, IN YOUR DREAMS.
WHAT DID JANE WANT?

24:41.828 --> 24:43.786
HE WANTS US BACK AT THE MUSEUM.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.484
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

24:45.527 --> 24:47.486
MUSEUM HEIST.WHY?

24:47.529 --> 24:50.358
I STOPPED ASKING QUESTIONS
A LONG TIME AGO. COME ON.

24:55.363 --> 24:56.799
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

24:56.843 --> 24:58.627
WE JUST NEED TO COVER
OUR BASES, SIR.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.324
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH THE INVESTIGATION?

25:00.368 --> 25:02.805
I CAN'T DISCUSS ONGOING DETAILS
OF AN INVESTIGATION.

25:02.849 --> 25:05.634
I'M GONNA NEED TO LOOK
AT ONE OF THESE, UH, SPIDERS.

25:05.678 --> 25:07.810
THE TARANTULAS?

25:07.854 --> 25:10.509
HEY, KIDS, CHECK OUT
THESE SPIDERS.[excited clamoring]

25:10.552 --> 25:12.989
THE TARANTULAS, YES.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.817
I DON'T SEE WHY IT IS
NECESSARY.

25:14.861 --> 25:16.515
DON'T WORRY, SIR.
THIS IS, UH,

25:16.558 --> 25:19.169
OFFICIAL POLICE BUSINESS.

25:19.213 --> 25:23.347

25:23.391 --> 25:26.176
I'M GONNA NEED TO TAKE
A CLOSE LOOK AT THIS...OOH!

UH, YEAH.

25:40.713 --> 25:43.542
I-I DON'T SEE WHY THIS
IS NECESSARY.

UH, YEAH...

26:12.919 --> 26:14.398

26:14.442 --> 26:16.226
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.OH, I'M FEELING WOOZY.

26:16.270 --> 26:17.706
NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.
I'M FINE.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.708
DON'T PLAY WITH SPIDERS, KIDS.
OKAY?

26:25.758 --> 26:27.716
WE'VE GOT A REAL TREAT TODAY.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.240
YOU COULD CALL IT
"EVOLUTION IN ACTION."

26:30.284 --> 26:33.417
MR. PATRICK JANE IS COMING
TO GIVE US A SEMINAR

26:33.461 --> 26:35.071
ON THE UPPER LIMITS
OF MEMORY.

26:35.115 --> 26:38.248

26:38.292 --> 26:41.600
GREAT.[students murmuring]

26:41.643 --> 26:44.080
THE HUMAN MEMORY
IS FAR MORE CAPABLE

26:44.124 --> 26:45.604
THAN MOST PEOPLE REALIZE.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.736
I'VE BEEN IN THIS ROOM
ONCE BEFORE.

26:47.780 --> 26:50.086
BUT WHEN I WAS IN HERE...

26:50.130 --> 26:52.088
[snaps fingers twice][gasping]

26:52.132 --> 26:53.612
I PAID ATTENTION.

26:53.655 --> 26:54.917
[students murmuring]

26:54.961 --> 26:57.485
VERY CLOSE ATTENTION.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.621
HUH...

27:02.664 --> 27:04.448
[applause]

27:04.492 --> 27:06.929
OH, THANK YOU. PLEASE.
BUT THAT'S JUST MEMORY 101.

27:06.973 --> 27:09.932
LET'S MOVE FORWARD
INTO THE ADVANCED COURSEWORK.

27:09.976 --> 27:13.936
FOR MEMORY TO BE USEFUL,
IT HAS TO BE AS ACCURATE

27:13.980 --> 27:16.112
AND AS FAST AS A CAMERA.

27:16.156 --> 27:17.766
HOW MANY ANIMALS DID YOU GET,
LISBON?

27:17.810 --> 27:19.768
AROUND 30.AND YOU GOT THEM
FROM LINDA'S OFFICE?

27:19.812 --> 27:21.117
YES, I DID.

27:21.161 --> 27:23.467
ALL OF THE ANIMALS
CAME FROM LINDA'S OFFICE.

27:23.511 --> 27:25.774
THAT'S A PLACE
THAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN.

27:25.818 --> 27:28.951
AND IN A MOMENT,
I WILL TURN AROUND

27:28.995 --> 27:30.953
AND LOOK BEHIND ME--
AND JUST FOR A FEW SECONDS--

27:30.997 --> 27:34.957
AND I WILL MEMORIZE EVERY
ANIMAL ON THOSE TABLES IN ORDER.

27:35.001 --> 27:37.786
AND THEN I WILL SHOW YOU
HOW YOU CAN DO THE SAME.

27:37.830 --> 27:39.962
HOW DO WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T
ALREADY MEMORIZE THEM?

27:40.006 --> 27:42.965
AH. A SKEPTIC.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

27:43.009 --> 27:44.793
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.[students murmuring]

27:44.837 --> 27:46.665
THERE'S NO REASON
FOR YOU TO TRUST ME.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.972
PAUL, WOULD YOU MIND
REARRANGING THE ANIMALS

27:50.016 --> 27:51.670
ANY WAY YOU SEE FIT?

27:51.713 --> 27:52.801
SURE.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.673
THANK YOU.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.979
THE HUMAN BRAIN.

27:57.023 --> 28:00.679
ONCE YOU GET IT WORKING RIGHT,
IT CAN BE INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE.

28:00.722 --> 28:03.682
THE MIND CAN DO SOME
MIRACULOUS THINGS.

28:03.725 --> 28:07.686
UH, LIKE...
TELLING THE FUTURE.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.513
WHICH IS WHAT I'M DOING
RIGHT NOW.

28:09.557 --> 28:10.819
BULL.

28:10.863 --> 28:14.693
[murmuring continues]

28:14.736 --> 28:18.174
FOR THAT...

28:18.218 --> 28:21.700
YOU CAN BE THE ONE
WHO HOLDS THE PREDICTION.

28:21.743 --> 28:24.354
SCIENCE IS ABOUT PREDICTION,
ISN'T IT?

28:24.398 --> 28:26.182
PREDICTIONS BASED ON
HARD DATA,

28:26.226 --> 28:27.706
NOT FORTUNETELLING.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.708
AHH.
WELL, YOU SAY "TOMATO,"

28:29.751 --> 28:32.536
I SAY SCIENTISTS BELIEVE
IN RATIONAL THOUGHT.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.843
AND GRIDS AND LISTS
AND CLASSIFICATION,

28:34.887 --> 28:36.540
WHICH IS FINE, BUT IT'S NOT
HOW THE WORLD WORKS,

28:36.584 --> 28:38.717
AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT
HOW THE BRAIN WORKS.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.850
YOU'RE SAYING
PEOPLE AREN'T RATIONAL?

28:41.894 --> 28:45.027
WELL, BEING RATIONAL
IS A TOOL,

28:45.071 --> 28:46.855
BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY TOOL
WE HAVE.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.727
LONG BEFORE WE STUFFED
OUR KNOWLEDGE

28:48.770 --> 28:50.859
INTO GRAPHS AND CHARTS,

28:50.903 --> 28:53.209
WE USED OLDER AND,
IN SOME CASES,

28:53.253 --> 28:55.734
MORE ENTERTAINING WAYS
TO REMEMBER THINGS.

28:55.777 --> 28:57.387
HOW WE DOING THERE, PAUL?

28:57.431 --> 29:00.042
I THINK WE'RE GOOD.EXCELLENT.
PLEASE, TAKE A SEAT.

29:00.086 --> 29:03.089
NOW, I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

29:06.266 --> 29:10.574
[clicks tongue
and whistles]

29:10.618 --> 29:13.229
LISBON, UH, WOULD YOU MIND?

29:13.273 --> 29:14.622
THANK YOU.

29:16.450 --> 29:20.410
WE CAN CREATE A MEMORY
BY BUILDING A PALACE

29:20.454 --> 29:22.761
IN OUR MINDS.

29:22.804 --> 29:25.241
WE CAN SING OURSELVES A SONG,

29:25.285 --> 29:27.417
OR TELL OURSELVES
A LITTLE STORY.

29:27.461 --> 29:30.072
A STORY OF A BULLY--

29:30.116 --> 29:32.248
A GRAY FOX--

29:32.292 --> 29:33.902
AND A LITTLE BRAVE MAN--

29:33.946 --> 29:35.599
A RAT--

29:35.643 --> 29:39.081
THAT STOOD UP FOR HIS CHUBBY
LITTLE BUDDY THE TOAD

29:39.125 --> 29:41.780
AND HIS FRIEND EGGHEAD.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.912
THE STORY OF A MAN
IN A TUXEDO

29:43.956 --> 29:45.784
WHO SNAKED HIS WAY
THROUGH A CROWD

29:45.827 --> 29:48.612
TO MEET A WOMAN
IN A COLORFUL DRESS.

29:48.656 --> 29:52.921
PENGUIN, COBRA,
THREE SQUIRRELS, AND A PARROT.

29:52.965 --> 29:55.445
THE STORY OF FLIGHT...[murmuring]

29:55.489 --> 29:58.622
AN OWL, A BAT, A MOTH,

29:58.666 --> 29:59.928
ALL...

29:59.972 --> 30:01.930
[murmuring continues]

30:01.974 --> 30:04.454
AH, I SENSE I MADE A MISTAKE.

30:04.498 --> 30:06.805
NO MOTH.HMM.

30:06.848 --> 30:11.940
WELL, PERHAPS MY PREDICTION
WILL EXPLAIN MY ERROR.

30:11.984 --> 30:14.682
UH, JEANETTE,
COULD YOU READ IT OUT, PLEASE?

30:17.685 --> 30:20.296
"THE MOTH IS
IN PAUL'S POCKET"?

30:20.340 --> 30:22.646
WAIT, WHAT?

30:22.690 --> 30:23.952
THE MOTH.

30:23.996 --> 30:25.649
THE MOTH YOU STOLE
FROM THE TABLE

30:25.693 --> 30:27.303
WHEN YOU WERE REARRANGING
THE ANIMALS--

30:27.347 --> 30:29.828
IT'S IN YOUR POCKET.[murmuring continues]

30:29.871 --> 30:31.830
I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO EMPTY
YOUR POCKETS.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.135
COME ON.[murmuring continues]

30:33.179 --> 30:34.833
[scoffs]

30:34.876 --> 30:36.486
[Patrick]
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

30:36.530 --> 30:37.966
[murmuring and gasping]

30:38.010 --> 30:40.839
PAUL, WHY DID YOU
TAKE THE MOTH?

30:40.882 --> 30:43.667
UH...THAT'S A CALIFORNIA
JADE MOTH.

30:43.711 --> 30:45.147
SO IT IS.THE KIND HE DISCOVERED.

30:45.191 --> 30:47.671
I THOUGHT THE ONLY OTHER ONE
WAS IN THE MUSEUM.

30:47.715 --> 30:49.978
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?WAIT A SECOND.

30:50.022 --> 30:52.851
YOU SAID ALL THE ANIMALS
CAME FROM LINDA'S OFFICE.THEY DID.

30:52.894 --> 30:56.158
LINDA DIED BEFORE
PAUL DISCOVERED THE MOTH.

30:56.202 --> 30:58.857
THIS MOTH COULDN'T HAVE COME
FROM HER... OFFICE.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.075
YOU'LL GET THERE.

31:00.119 --> 31:02.861
UNLESS...
SHE DISCOVERED THE MOTH FIRST.

31:05.037 --> 31:06.342
PAUL...

31:06.386 --> 31:07.866
YOU DIDN'T KILL LINDA.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.171
YES, HE DID.

31:09.215 --> 31:12.696
BUT, UH, I CONFESS--

31:12.740 --> 31:14.524
THAT MOTH DIDN'T COME
FROM LINDA'S OFFICE.

31:14.568 --> 31:16.004
I...

31:16.048 --> 31:17.353
S--

31:17.397 --> 31:20.008
WELL, I-I BORROWED IT
FROM THE MUSEUM...

31:20.052 --> 31:21.880
TO PROVE A POINT.

31:21.923 --> 31:24.186
PAUL.

31:24.230 --> 31:27.537
[murmuring continues]

31:27.581 --> 31:30.889
I'D JUST HAD A PAPER
REJECTED.

31:30.932 --> 31:33.717
PEER REVIEW
THREW IT BACK AT ME.

31:33.761 --> 31:35.894
DR. KIDD WAS SO DISAPPOINTED.

31:35.937 --> 31:38.722
SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING.

31:38.766 --> 31:39.898
SHE NEVER HAD TO.

31:39.941 --> 31:42.030
HOW DID LINDA COME INTO IT?

31:42.074 --> 31:45.555
IT WAS LATE NIGHT
AT THE LAB.

31:45.599 --> 31:49.037
UH, SHE CAME IN FRESH
FROM THE FOREST, EXCITED.

31:49.081 --> 31:52.388
UH, SHE'D SEEN ONE OF HER
WOODPECKERS EATING A MOTH

31:52.432 --> 31:54.042
THAT SHE COULDN'T IDENTIFY.

31:54.086 --> 31:55.391
[clicks tongue]

31:55.435 --> 31:58.046
SO SHE PUT DOWN SOME BAIT
AND CAUGHT ONE.

31:58.090 --> 32:00.222
WE FOUND THE BROWN SUGAR
IN HER OFFICE.

32:00.266 --> 32:01.571
WAS THAT HER BAIT?

32:01.615 --> 32:03.051
YEAH.

32:03.095 --> 32:05.575
I KNEW WHAT IT WAS
THE MOMENT I SAW IT.

32:05.619 --> 32:07.926
A NEW SPECIES.

32:07.969 --> 32:09.405
I MEAN, THAT'S ARTICLES,

32:09.449 --> 32:10.929
THAT'S MUSEUM EXHIBITS,

32:10.972 --> 32:12.931
THAT'S MONEY
FOR THE PROGRAM.

32:12.974 --> 32:15.411
I SAW MYSELF NAMING THE MOTH.

32:15.455 --> 32:19.589
I'D--I'D ALWAYS WANTED
TO NAME SOMETHING.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.765
MY JOB WAS ON THE LINE.

32:21.809 --> 32:23.593
MY FUTURE.

32:23.637 --> 32:25.944
I NEEDED IT...

32:25.987 --> 32:27.641
TO SURVIVE.

32:36.476 --> 32:40.828
I JUST LOST MYSELF
COMPLETELY.

33:05.157 --> 33:07.115
THEN I WENT OUT TO
THE PART OF THE FOREST

33:07.159 --> 33:09.813
WHERE I KNEW SHE'D BEEN.

33:09.857 --> 33:12.338
DISCOVERED THE MOTH.

33:14.035 --> 33:16.995
I CAME BACK
AND GOT MY ACCOLADES.

33:17.038 --> 33:20.128
I SAVED MY JOB.

33:20.172 --> 33:22.522
I GOT EVERYTHING I WANTED.

33:35.056 --> 33:37.363
DR. KIDD.

33:39.060 --> 33:41.323
SONIA, PLEASE.

33:41.367 --> 33:44.022
I WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR CATCHING PAUL.

33:44.065 --> 33:48.722
AH. THERE'S NO THANKS
NECESSARY.

33:50.376 --> 33:53.031
LINDA'S DEAD,
PAUL'S IN JAIL,

33:53.074 --> 33:56.034
AND MEGAN IS BEING
EXPELLED.

33:56.077 --> 33:58.166
I DON'T THINK THE PROGRAM
WILL EVER RECOVER.

33:58.210 --> 34:01.169
THE PROGRAM ISN'T REAL.

34:01.213 --> 34:04.042
THE QUESTION IS,
WILL YOU RECOVER?

34:05.086 --> 34:07.871
[exhales] I FELT
SO POWERLESS.

34:07.915 --> 34:11.875
I MEAN, WHAT CAN YOU DO
IN THE FACE OF DEATH?

34:11.919 --> 34:13.877
YOU'RE NOT POWERLESS,
THOUGH.

34:13.921 --> 34:16.054
YOU ACT.

34:16.097 --> 34:17.620
WELL, THERE'S ONE THING
YOU CAN DO.

34:17.664 --> 34:21.059
UH... PAUL TOOK A LOT OF PRIDE
IN NAMING THAT MOTH, WHEN...

34:21.102 --> 34:23.061
WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
LINDA WHO NAMED IT.

34:23.104 --> 34:24.366
YES.

34:24.410 --> 34:27.543
I'LL MAKE SURE TO RENAME IT
AFTER HER.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.371
THANK YOU.

34:29.415 --> 34:30.764
PLEASURE.

34:33.593 --> 34:35.073
UH...

34:35.116 --> 34:38.380
YEAH.

34:38.424 --> 34:39.903
MAKES SENSE.

34:39.947 --> 34:41.905
ALL THE GOOD ONES
ARE TAKEN.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.081
[chuckles] PLEASE.

34:43.124 --> 34:44.908

I SUPPOSE.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.664
YOU SEE THAT?
DID YOU SEE THAT?

36:28.708 --> 36:30.492
THE FLUSH?
IT WAS VERY NICE.

36:30.536 --> 36:32.320
AH, I GUTTED HIM![laughs]

36:32.364 --> 36:34.017
I WOULD SAY SO, YEAH.[laughs] AW...

36:34.061 --> 36:37.020
THAT WAS VERY SLICK,

36:37.064 --> 36:39.022
YOU MUST REALLY WANT TO HELP
VAN PELT.

36:39.066 --> 36:41.199
WHAT DID JANE DO?

36:41.242 --> 36:43.201
OH, NOW THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE COY.

36:43.244 --> 36:45.681
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
A LITTLE QUID PRO QUO.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.209
I'LL AUTHORIZE THE STIPEND

37:02.263 --> 37:04.047
[elevator bell dings]

37:04.091 --> 37:06.224
AND SOME SCIENTISTS THINK
THE T. REX COULD RUN

37:06.267 --> 37:08.226
UP TO 45 MILES AN HOUR.

37:08.269 --> 37:10.532
THAT'S APEX PREDATOR.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?YES.

37:10.576 --> 37:12.230
THAT MEANS THEY'RE
TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN.

37:12.273 --> 37:13.535
THEY EAT EVERYTHING.SO?

37:13.579 --> 37:17.060

TRICERATOPS. I WIN.

37:19.933 --> 37:21.587
YOU HAVE NO LIFE.
I WIN.

37:29.943 --> 37:31.379
I OWE HER FROM YESTERDAY.

37:31.423 --> 37:33.251
SHE'S ON HER WAY
TO THE AIRPORT.

37:35.122 --> 37:37.255
OH. YEAH, FOR THAT
WHITE HAT THING.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.735
I THOUGHT THERE WASN'T MONEY.

37:39.779 --> 37:41.911
LISBON FIXED IT.

37:41.955 --> 37:44.131
OH.

37:45.437 --> 37:47.743
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

37:47.787 --> 37:50.572
YEAH, WELL, COWARDS DON'T GET
TO SAY GOOD-BYE WHEN THEY WANT.

37:50.616 --> 37:52.922
COW--WOW.

37:52.966 --> 37:54.576
WHERE'D THAT COME FROM?
YOU CALLING ME A COWARD?

38:01.322 --> 38:03.106
[exhales] HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN PRETENDING

38:03.150 --> 38:04.282
YOU'RE NOT IN LOVE
WITH VAN PELT?

38:04.325 --> 38:06.109
WHO SAYS I'M IN LOVE
WITH VAN PELT?

38:06.153 --> 38:08.286
I WAS ONCE, A LONG TIME AGO,
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

38:08.329 --> 38:11.767
WE'RE JUST...
WE'RE JUST... GOOD FRIENDS.

38:11.811 --> 38:13.595
YOU'RE A COWARD
AND TERRIBLE LIAR.

38:13.639 --> 38:15.945
UH... [chuckles]
SAYS YOU.

38:15.989 --> 38:19.122
"COWARD." WHAT DOES HE KNOW
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS?

38:19.166 --> 38:20.776
YEAH, WELL, YOU DATE
PREGNANT HOOKERS

38:20.820 --> 38:23.475
AND YOUR--
YOUR DINOSAUR EATS GRASS!

38:25.651 --> 38:27.305
[Patrick]
TICK-TOCK,

38:27.348 --> 38:31.483
TICK-TOCK, TICK-TOCK...

38:32.353 --> 38:33.963
MORNING.GOOD MORNING.

38:34.007 --> 38:36.314
WE'RE GONNA BE SHORT-STAFFED
FOR A WHILE.

38:36.357 --> 38:37.619
VAN PELT'S OFF TO L.A.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.142
THANK YOU.

38:39.186 --> 38:41.144
ADULT EDUCATION'S
A BEAUTIFUL THING.

38:41.188 --> 38:43.973
UH, SPEAKING OF WHICH,
UH...

38:44.017 --> 38:47.150
I'VE UPSET THE ECOSYSTEM
OF THE POKER GAME.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.631
I THINK YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING
TOO MUCH TIME AT THE MUSEUM.

38:49.675 --> 38:51.329
"UPSET THE ECOSYSTEM"?

38:51.372 --> 38:53.635
BERTRAM'S NOW A BETTER
POKER PLAYER BECAUSE OF ME.

38:53.679 --> 38:57.335
THE ECOSYSTEM HAS CHANGED.
YOU NEED TO ADAPT OR DIE.

38:57.378 --> 38:58.684
WHO SAYS I NEED THE HELP?

39:03.210 --> 39:05.647
DON'T TRY
TO RAZZLE-DAZZLE ME.

39:05.691 --> 39:07.345
MONEY TALKS.

39:07.388 --> 39:08.998
[shuffles cards]WHAT DO WE USE FOR STAKES?

39:09.042 --> 39:11.174
YOU CAN'T PLAY POKER
WITHOUT STAKES.

39:11.218 --> 39:13.176
OH, I HAVE THAT COVERED.

39:13.220 --> 39:17.006
HERBIVORES ARE WORTH 1,
CARNIVORES ARE WORTH 5.

39:17.050 --> 39:18.356
OKAY.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.534
DEAL.

39:28.235 --> 39:29.889
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

39:36.896 --> 39:39.028
[clears throat]
ALL IN.

39:39.072 --> 39:40.552
YOU'RE BLUFFING. I CALL.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.685
REALLY?

39:43.729 --> 39:45.034
OKAY, ARE YOU CHEATING?

39:45.078 --> 39:46.035
NO.

39:46.079 --> 39:47.210
WH--

39:47.254 --> 39:49.909
I'M GONNA SMOKE YOU.
