WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.753
I need a trauma surgeon
for a possible amputation.

00:03.921 --> 00:05.046
How long on
that surgeon?

00:05.214 --> 00:06.798
We need to pull back.
It's gonna give.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.220
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:14.390 --> 00:15.306
Glad you're back,
Herrmann.

00:15.474 --> 00:17.392
We're a better house
with you here.
Thanks, Chief.

00:17.559 --> 00:18.976
This is Nicki Rutkowski.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.061
Hello.

00:20.229 --> 00:21.813
She is gonna be working
with us next month.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.356
Her father is one
of my oldest friends.

00:27.653 --> 00:28.611
Hey.
Hey.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.363
Do you maybe wanna
hook up for a beer?

00:30.531 --> 00:32.281
Peter Mills, are you gay?
Me? No.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.366
Because I am.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.369
Did you hear about
Hallie and Casey?
What?

00:36.537 --> 00:38.663
That maybe
they're splitting up.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.416
I've been thinking...

00:42.960 --> 00:45.503
What if we simplify things,

00:45.671 --> 00:48.715
start fresh, put it all aside,

00:48.882 --> 00:50.633
and live every day like
it could be the last.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.515
Hey
Hey.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.393
I need something.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.563
It's the last one.
Yeah...

01:03.731 --> 01:04.939
I mean it.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.783
Oh, no.
Pull my legs.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.539
What the hell
just happened?

01:24.960 --> 01:26.836
Ah, the damn
thing's fried.

01:27.004 --> 01:29.505
Two hours left
in the shift
and no calls yet.

01:29.673 --> 01:30.965
That happen very often?

01:33.886 --> 01:35.762
He did not
just say that.

01:38.891 --> 01:41.684
Accident, Truck 81,
Squad 3.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.821
Mills...

01:53.989 --> 01:56.741
Pitcher's got
a no-hitter going
in the eighth inning,

01:56.909 --> 01:59.994
do you go up to him
and say, "Looks like
you got a no-hitter going?"

02:00.162 --> 02:01.162
No, but...

02:01.330 --> 02:03.664
Don't do it at
the damn firehouse,
either.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.249
Yeah, I got it.

02:20.933 --> 02:22.266
Stabilize the van!

02:24.394 --> 02:25.478
Jammed.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.150
Anybody get ejected?

02:31.318 --> 02:32.693
See if you can get
a pulse over here?

02:32.861 --> 02:34.362
Got one here!

02:37.157 --> 02:39.700
I'm okay.
I'm all right.
Whoa.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.702
Field-test this idiot.

02:44.915 --> 02:45.873
Open containers
right there.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.250
I'll take care of it.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.918
She's going!
She's going!

02:50.295 --> 02:51.504
What happened?

02:56.301 --> 02:57.426
Stabilize her!

03:00.597 --> 03:01.931
Trimming!

03:02.099 --> 03:03.349
You got it.

03:07.855 --> 03:08.938
Let's go!

03:16.029 --> 03:17.446
Give us ten more
seconds, boys.

03:17.614 --> 03:18.990
You got eight.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.075
Hey, sir,
just sit tight
for me there, all right?

03:21.243 --> 03:22.410
Don't try and
unbuckle yourself.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.161
Is he all right?
My son!

03:24.329 --> 03:25.413
He's not saying anything.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.291
Yeah,
he's alive, sir.
Oh, thank God.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.709
We're gonna need
a second ambo.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.128
Two more. Driver of
the first car over there.

03:32.296 --> 03:34.005
I need two back boards.
Open up the doors!

03:45.183 --> 03:47.268
- Too tight?
- Yeah!

03:47.436 --> 03:48.811
Ah! We're gonna
go through
the windshield.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.730
- Get me a pick head.
- Coming up.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.567
What happened?

03:54.735 --> 03:56.027
You're gonna be okay,
buddy.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.194
Hockey fan, huh?

03:57.362 --> 03:59.071
We were headed
to Evanston for
his tournament.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.531
You okay, Mikey?

04:00.699 --> 04:02.533
Yeah, I think so.
What happened?

04:02.701 --> 04:04.201
Be careful!
Be careful!

04:22.179 --> 04:23.554
Vehicle stabilized.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.682
I'll be right back.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.809
Sir, you're coming out
first, all right?

04:33.815 --> 04:35.358
Where's the driver?

04:35.525 --> 04:37.777
Uh, some officers
took him to
the hospital.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.111
You're kidding me.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.988
No, he was complaining
of leg pain

04:41.156 --> 04:43.199
and you guys looked
swamped over there so...

04:43.367 --> 04:45.910
He should
have been C-collared
and transported properly.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.161
My bad.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.919
Did you bag
the beer cans?

04:55.087 --> 04:56.212
Look...

04:56.380 --> 04:59.715
Detective Voight behind me,
the guy in the jacket,

05:03.095 --> 05:05.638
that was his son
driving this car.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.377
Hey,
you want some coffee?

05:36.545 --> 05:38.671
No, I'm gonna go hit
the gym. I'll see you
at the firehouse.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.673
All right.
How's your arm?

05:40.841 --> 05:42.466
It's good.

05:42.634 --> 05:43.843
It's fine.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.637
All right.
Well, you should get it
looked at, you know, Kelly.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.015
It could act up
at the wrong time.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.474
No, absolutely.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.062
I'm planning on doing that.
All right, I'll see you later.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.275
Bye.

05:59.443 --> 06:01.110
There you go.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.574
Dude, I'm sorry,
but I ordered
crispy bacon.

06:06.742 --> 06:09.493
And this ain't crispy.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.620
Where's
the hot waitress?

06:14.541 --> 06:16.542
Oh, I mean you're
cute and everything.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.759
I'll be right back
with your bacon, sir.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.688
Elise, I can't wait
for Mom. I gotta go.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.523
Then go.

06:39.691 --> 06:40.691
Table eight.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.695
Where you going?
It's work, Mom.
My real job.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.238
Well, Samantha
just called in sick.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.658
Mom, I'll cover it.
We'll be fine.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.494
You can switch shifts
with somebody
at the firehouse.

06:51.661 --> 06:52.745
Mom...

06:52.913 --> 06:55.581
I'm a candidate.
You know that they can
bounce me like that.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.249
I...

06:57.417 --> 06:58.834
I have to go.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.336
Fine, go.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.776
You're late!

07:29.825 --> 07:32.827
Oh, good afternoon,
candidate.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.454
Sorry.
First he blows
a no-hitter,

07:35.622 --> 07:37.206
now he's coming in
five minutes late.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.707
So much for
Employee of the Week.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.918
It won't happen again.
I promise.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.963
Get changed out.
Let's go.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.682
You know,
you were the candidate
up until two weeks ago.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.183
Why you riding
him so hard?

07:56.351 --> 07:58.769
The abused abuse.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.020
Cruz.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.109
Good morning.

08:05.277 --> 08:06.735
Uh-oh.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.279
We're either in trouble
or he wants something.

08:09.573 --> 08:10.573
You got a sec?

08:11.575 --> 08:13.450
Later.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.035
What's up?

08:15.203 --> 08:17.496
Is your brother still
working in Vice?

08:17.664 --> 08:18.706
Yeah.

08:18.874 --> 08:21.667
Could you see
if he can swing
by here real quick?

08:21.835 --> 08:23.210
Sure.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.212
All your hookers get
locked up last night?

08:25.380 --> 08:27.047
Yeah,
my whole stable.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.676
I just got
a question for him.

08:30.844 --> 08:31.886
Oh, yeah.
I'll give him a call.

08:32.053 --> 08:34.346
Okay.
Everything all right?

08:34.514 --> 08:35.848
Yeah, yeah.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.686
Okay.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.904
Hey, Lieutenant.

08:50.071 --> 08:50.738
Hi.

08:50.906 --> 08:53.574
I wanted you to know that
I just completed the last
of my tech courses

08:53.742 --> 08:55.868
and I reached
my Squad certification.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.244
That's great. Good job.

08:57.412 --> 09:00.164
Yeah, three years,
busting my hump,
but I got it done.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.250
And so I'm putting in
a transfer from Truck

09:03.418 --> 09:05.085
and I wanted
to get your blessing.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.965
Why do you want
to come over to Squad?

09:11.301 --> 09:12.218
Where I want to end up,

09:12.385 --> 09:14.887
Squad's the best place
in terms of a stepping stone
to getting promoted. I...

09:15.055 --> 09:16.138
Let me stop you
right there.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.932
Vargas,
if that's your reason
for coming over...

09:18.099 --> 09:20.100
It ain't.
That came out wrong.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.979
The promotion stuff,
that's down the road.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.773
It's way down the road.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.149
Absolutely.

09:34.991 --> 09:35.866
That ain't gonna cut it.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.202
The sign's out front.
Just a matter of time

09:38.370 --> 09:39.828
till a Good Samaritan
steps up.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.038
We can do that?

09:41.206 --> 09:43.582
Oh, yeah.
It's frowned upon,

09:43.750 --> 09:46.919
but it's not illegal,
per standards
and procedures.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.671
Last year
we got the new...

09:48.838 --> 09:50.464
What was it?
Microwave.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.466
We got
the new microwave
by doing this.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.385
It took three months
to get the new microwave.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.803
The Bears game
is this Sunday.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.096
What do we got
in the treasury box?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.180
Dick.

09:58.348 --> 10:02.309
We spent it all on the
elliptical machine so Shay
could keep her ass toned.

10:02.477 --> 10:05.771
Oh, Herrmann, please.
Everyone benefits from
me having a toned ass.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.151
Mills, you're in charge
of a fundraiser
for a new TV.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.444
Instead of cooking?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.029
In conjunction
with cooking.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.407
I believe it's called
multi-tasking.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.492
Can you get some ideas
together, ASAP?

10:20.078 --> 10:21.078
Casey.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.292
He in?
On the phone.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.877
You can leave it
with me, though.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.298
Hey, um,
tomorrow night,

10:32.465 --> 10:33.799
I don't know
if you have plans,

10:33.967 --> 10:36.051
but me and some girlfriends
are going to see Kaskade

10:36.219 --> 10:37.469
at the Vic,
if you're interested.

10:38.847 --> 10:39.972
What's Kaskade?

10:40.140 --> 10:40.889
Oh.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.933
He's a DJ.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.059
Famous one.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.227
Yeah, um...

10:48.940 --> 10:51.900
Look, I'm not really known
for my self-restraint,

10:52.068 --> 10:53.694
so I'll need you
to meet me halfway here

10:53.862 --> 10:55.946
and respect Boden
and your dad's wishes.

11:03.204 --> 11:06.790
Who wants to be known
as the rat fireman who
took down a cop's kid?

11:06.958 --> 11:10.002
What's the cop's name?
Detective Voight.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.879
Aye-yi.

11:12.047 --> 11:13.756
What's the problem?

11:13.923 --> 11:16.884
Voight's been hip-deep
in the Gang Unit
for 15 years.

11:17.052 --> 11:19.636
He's been investigated
for taking bribes and...

11:19.804 --> 11:22.264
Look, he's a dirty cop.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.183
The kind of guy
who gives the rest
of us a bad name.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.186
Okay.

11:27.354 --> 11:32.316
Well, I saw what I saw.
The question is,
did anyone else see it?

11:32.484 --> 11:35.069
I'll ask around,
put some feelers out.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.528
Wait to hear from me.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.905
'Cause I'm telling you
as a friend of my sister's,

11:38.073 --> 11:40.115
you do not want to mess
with this dude.

11:40.283 --> 11:43.452
Lieutenant Casey!
Chief wants to see you
in his office.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.997
Okay.
Whatever you can do,
I'd appreciate it.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.257
How long you been
dating this guy?

11:59.511 --> 12:01.887
What?
Antonio, what do you...

12:02.055 --> 12:04.848
Where do you come up
with this stuff?
You're trippin'.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.850
I'm not. I'm...

12:08.269 --> 12:09.395
He's taken.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.814
Ah.
So.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.524
All right.

12:13.691 --> 12:14.650
Well, I'll be in touch.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.485
Are you being
straight with him?

12:16.653 --> 12:18.153
If anything,
I downplayed it.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.614
Your boy's messing
with a stick
of dynamite.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.574
Then do your job
and help him out.

12:26.454 --> 12:29.123
Incident Report
from that T-bone
last shift.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.083
I got Severide's,
where's yours?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.585
Right. I've been buried
in paperwork and...

12:35.463 --> 12:38.006
On my desk
by the end of this shift.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.681
Is that going
to be a problem?

12:47.308 --> 12:48.767
Not at all.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.279
Neighborhood
hot dog eating contest.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.364
Nah. Too tacky.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.700
And putting a sign out front
begging for a TV is what?

13:04.868 --> 13:05.951
She's got a point.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.245
Okay, how about
a T-shirt booth
in the driveway?

13:08.413 --> 13:09.663
We already sell T-shirts.

13:09.831 --> 13:12.583
Yeah, but, I mean,
no one can ever find
the key to the cabinet,

13:12.750 --> 13:15.461
Herrmann never has change
in the treasury box.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.671
It's a pain in the ass.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.340
So, we put
the shirts out front
and display them properly.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.801
I don't know how
that's going to
generate enough money.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.053
And... And we get Nicki
to man the booth.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.680
Ding. Done.

13:27.682 --> 13:30.017
Now, that is called
putting it over
the goal line, Peter Mills.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.894
Why don't you put her
in a bikini while
you're at it?

13:34.898 --> 13:37.191
Now, before I respond,
are you joking or serious?

13:37.358 --> 13:40.235
About as serious
as putting you
in a bikini.

13:40.403 --> 13:41.361
That's what I thought.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.698
So, yes, a bikini
would be ridiculous
and we get the joke.

13:44.866 --> 13:47.493
So what do
you think, Casey?
T-shirt stand?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.661
Or should we
have Mills here

13:49.829 --> 13:53.081
run a few laps around
the block and think
about some alternatives?

13:54.959 --> 13:57.794
Everybody on the floor.
We're gonna do a drill.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.510
Mills, listen up.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.387
This is
a Downed Firefighter
Assessment.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.389
Fellow firefighter
is gonna be on the floor

14:09.557 --> 14:11.433
in full gear with
his PASS alarm
going off.

14:11.601 --> 14:12.893
You crawl in
from 10 feet away,

14:13.061 --> 14:15.312
deactivate his alarm,
check for air flow,

14:15.480 --> 14:16.813
call in a May Day
on your radio,

14:16.981 --> 14:18.899
then drag the victim
to the extraction point,

14:19.067 --> 14:21.985
which will be
the North Gate.

14:22.153 --> 14:24.029
Okay.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.241
All with a blacked out
face mask to simulate
zero visibility.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.326
Okay.

14:29.494 --> 14:32.120
There's no showing up late
to this one, candidate. Huh?

14:34.666 --> 14:36.583
I've got two masks.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.004
The slowest time
has to mop
the apparatus floor.

14:41.172 --> 14:42.923
Time 'em.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.508
Let's go,
gentlemen. Gear up!

14:44.676 --> 14:46.176
Hey, Hal.
What's going on?

14:47.929 --> 14:50.055
Lunch break.
You eaten yet?

14:50.223 --> 14:51.765
No. Come on.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.562
Hey, Gabriela.
Oh! Hallie.
Good seeing you.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.063
You, too.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.694
Hey, this came in
for you earlier.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.405
Thanks.

15:21.671 --> 15:22.879
You look pleased
with yourself.

15:24.507 --> 15:27.968
Downed Firefighter Assessment,
new house record.

15:28.136 --> 15:30.387
Oh, yeah?
How's Otis taking it?

15:30.555 --> 15:34.808
I don't know.
But the floor was
looking pretty dirty. So...

15:34.976 --> 15:37.394
Is that a little cockiness
I sense there, Peter Mills?

15:37.562 --> 15:39.813
It can't be cocky
if you can back it up.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.607
Oh, really?

15:41.774 --> 15:44.735
Well, a lotta candidates
with skills get their day
in the sun,

15:44.902 --> 15:48.572
but how they handle
themselves the other 364,

15:48.740 --> 15:50.198
that's what
keeps them around.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.619
I will take that
under advisement.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.713
What happened
to the passengers
in the other car?

16:04.881 --> 16:05.839
I don't know.

16:06.007 --> 16:09.259
They were alert when
we got 'em backboarded
and into the ambos.

16:09.427 --> 16:10.802
It was a dad
and his son.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.015
What was the last name?

16:16.309 --> 16:17.517
Duffy.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.396
A son, 16?

16:21.564 --> 16:23.023
On his way to
a hockey tournament?

16:23.191 --> 16:24.941
Yeah.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.151
You heard something?

16:28.112 --> 16:30.656
Baby...
What? Just...

16:30.823 --> 16:31.907
Tell me.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.744
It's a complete
L-2 fracture.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.038
He's paralyzed,
waist down.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.588
We just got
a TV donated.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.674
Flatscreen.
Still in the box.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.718
Cop over at the 35th Precinct
donated it.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.142
Oh, yeah, baby!

17:02.021 --> 17:04.690
Oh! Yeah!

17:04.857 --> 17:05.774
Who's it from?

17:05.942 --> 17:08.110
Detective Voight.
He saw your sign.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.320
What's that,
a 40-inch?
A forty-three.

17:10.488 --> 17:11.822
Oh, goddamn!

17:11.989 --> 17:13.031
Whoo!

17:14.617 --> 17:15.951
Take it back.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.120
No, no, no,
don't worry.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.205
Voight went through
all the channels and
had it donated to the city,

17:20.373 --> 17:21.790
but specified
that it come here

17:21.958 --> 17:23.875
so the Bureau bitches
aren't gonna freak out.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.293
Send it back.

17:32.051 --> 17:32.926
Sure.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.095
You got it.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.768
Is that something
you need to
bring me in on?

17:44.480 --> 17:45.647
Yeah.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.379
Evites are
so impersonal.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.428
Leave it on.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.055
Girl, you are barking
up the wrong tree.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.932
Yeah? Prove it.

18:28.941 --> 18:33.153
Jumper. Squad 3,
Truck 81, Ambulance 61.

18:36.991 --> 18:37.949
Still alive?

18:38.117 --> 18:40.869
Yeah, but if he wanted to
be dead before, I guarantee
he wants it now.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.287
- How high?
- Fourth floor.

18:43.331 --> 18:44.414
I'll call ahead
to St. Mary's,

18:44.582 --> 18:46.625
tell them to prep
for spinal trauma and
multiple broken bones.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.253
It's not like that.
The poor bastard
impaled himself.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.638
Holy smokes.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.692
We've got a pulse!

19:12.860 --> 19:14.277
We need two ladders
and a rope bag.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.655
You pull him off,
he bleeds out,
right here, right now.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.031
Chief?

19:19.909 --> 19:21.451
Get the K-12.
We're cutting him down.

19:36.634 --> 19:39.219
Pump some water
on that steel
so it doesn't overheat.

19:39.387 --> 19:40.512
He's gonna arrest!

19:40.680 --> 19:41.763
Talk to the saw,
not me!

19:41.931 --> 19:43.515
You're going to be all right.
Just try and stay still.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.892
He can't hear you.
He's in shock.

19:52.817 --> 19:53.984
Hold that.

19:57.488 --> 19:58.905
All right, get ready!
He's coming down!

19:59.073 --> 20:00.699
Three, two, one.

20:01.742 --> 20:02.659
- Everybody good?
- Yeah.

20:02.827 --> 20:03.827
I got it.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.292
Whoa!

20:10.459 --> 20:12.043
He's going into V-fib,
we've gotta pull the fence.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.587
What happened to
"we pull it, he dies?"

20:13.754 --> 20:14.504
We got to get his
heart back on rhythm,

20:14.672 --> 20:16.756
but there's no way
I'm shocking him until
we get this iron out first.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.425
Severide!
Yo!

20:34.358 --> 20:35.775
Pull it away. Go.

20:41.657 --> 20:42.782
All right, hit it!

20:42.950 --> 20:45.201
On me. Ready, pull!

20:47.580 --> 20:50.248
One, two, three!

20:51.626 --> 20:52.792
Pull them out for me.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.630
Okay, here we go.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.090
Shocking on two.
Stand by. Clear!

21:01.761 --> 21:03.929
Hitting him again
at 360. Stand by.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.096
Clear.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.516
Rhythm.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.852
He's got a pulse.
Okay, get him in!

21:11.020 --> 21:12.812
Forty-year-old male,
suicide attempt.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.981
Fell from four stories,
impaled on a fence.

21:15.149 --> 21:17.692
You removed it on scene?
He went into V-fib.
Had to yank.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.569
Two shocks on the monitor
brought him back.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.154
Let's get him into One.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.705
I'll be right back.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.629
Kendra.

21:37.797 --> 21:38.880
Hey, you.
Hey.

21:40.591 --> 21:42.300
Missed you on Saturday.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.636
Yeah, I was working.
How was it?

21:45.930 --> 21:46.846
Food was good.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.723
But I don't know
why Kim's still
with Kristin.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.058
All they do is pick
at each other.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.309
I mean, enough already,
you know?

21:51.477 --> 21:54.270
Yeah, I know, believe me.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.314
Listen...

21:56.482 --> 21:58.149
I need a big favor.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.168
You got any ibuprofen?

22:17.336 --> 22:19.504
Yes, indeedy.
How many you want?

22:19.672 --> 22:21.089
Five.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.841
Here's two.

22:29.807 --> 22:33.018
Seriously, too many can
do serious damage
to your kidneys, okay?

22:36.313 --> 22:38.773
Don't come running to me
when you're on dialysis
in five years, okay?

22:39.817 --> 22:40.817
Thanks.

22:40.985 --> 22:44.237
Seriously, you look it up,
ibuprofen and kidneys.

22:44.405 --> 22:45.572
Okay.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.825
A buddy of mine
who works out
of Voight's precinct

22:48.993 --> 22:50.493
said nothing's come up
in witness statements.

22:50.661 --> 22:53.038
So you're trying
to tell me no one else
saw his kid drunk?

22:53.205 --> 22:55.373
Hell, yes, other people
saw his kid drunk.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.792
But they were other cops
who aren't about
to go up against Voight.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.711
Well,
I would rather my guy
not be the only one

22:59.879 --> 23:01.838
with his head above
the foxhole on this one.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.465
I understand.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.633
The passenger in
the other car isn't
gonna walk again.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.802
I know. I know.

23:07.970 --> 23:11.014
Look, give me till
the end of the shift.

23:11.182 --> 23:12.640
But if
I come up empty...

23:13.642 --> 23:17.228
Voight's been pulling his son
out of things like this
since the kid was 15.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.647
Lot of people had to
turn the other way,

23:19.815 --> 23:21.733
and I'm just telling you,

23:21.901 --> 23:24.444
if it was Gabby
who was in your shoes...

23:24.612 --> 23:27.280
And I'm not proud
to admit this,

23:27.448 --> 23:28.907
but I'd tell her
to stay out of it.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.043
Those tomatoes
are only good for
another day or so.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.715
Elise, I'm done
at the restaurant.

23:45.883 --> 23:49.719
I mean, I came in late
at the beginning
of a shift...

23:49.887 --> 23:51.137
That ain't
gonna happen again.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.599
Mom has just gotta
deal with it.

23:54.767 --> 23:55.934
Then tell her.

23:56.102 --> 23:59.646
Well, I'm going to.
But I need you to
back me up, okay?

24:00.648 --> 24:02.148
I mean, you know
what's going on here,
right?

24:02.316 --> 24:04.901
Of course. Why do you
think I've been there
on every day off?

24:05.069 --> 24:06.986
You think
I like slinging hash?

24:07.988 --> 24:09.697
Hey.
What's up?

24:09.865 --> 24:12.033
Lieutenant Severide,
this is my sister, Elise.

24:13.536 --> 24:14.869
Nice to meet you.
You, too.

24:21.252 --> 24:25.797
Mom has got to realize
that Dad loved being
a firefighter.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.633
And I'm not gonna
run from something
I want to do with my life

24:28.801 --> 24:29.884
just to make
her feel better.

24:31.637 --> 24:32.762
Then reassure her.
Well, how?

24:32.930 --> 24:34.973
I don't know.
She's scared.

24:36.892 --> 24:39.185
She doesn't want
to lose you, too.

24:47.695 --> 24:48.903
Hey! How are
the T-shirts going?

24:49.071 --> 24:50.655
Pretty good.
Couple hundred
bucks so far.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.365
I'm almost out of
Squad T-shirts though.

24:52.533 --> 24:53.575
Well, what about
Truck shirts?

24:53.742 --> 24:55.493
Those are just kinda
sitting there.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.579
I think it's because of
the goat emblems.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.581
Not a big seller.
Why a goat?

24:59.748 --> 25:00.832
That's what
I've been saying!

25:01.000 --> 25:03.459
The goats are freakin
killing us, guys.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.670
I wouldn't mind
an explanation
from Casey

25:05.838 --> 25:07.255
on the flatscreen
of it all.

25:07.423 --> 25:08.631
Drop it.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.761
I didn't know your side job
was the restaurant
business, Mills.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.763
For now.
Phasing that out, though.

25:15.931 --> 25:19.392
I think you're the only
food-related side job
we got in here,

25:19.560 --> 25:24.606
'cause let's see,
we got security guard,
construction...

25:24.773 --> 25:27.483
What about you?
General entrepreneurship.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.652
I was doing pretty good
as a day trader,
you know,

25:29.820 --> 25:31.654
until all the trolls
jumped onboard

25:31.822 --> 25:35.450
and, you know,
capsized it
for guys like me.

25:35.618 --> 25:37.660
You know, it's funny
that you bring it up,

25:37.828 --> 25:41.289
Peter Mills, because
I'm actually circling
an investment opportunity

25:41.457 --> 25:42.540
that could be massive.

25:42.708 --> 25:46.586
You know, and I might
let you guys get in on it.

25:46.754 --> 25:47.670
Well, what is it?

25:47.838 --> 25:52.050
Nah. You guys are gonna
have to wait 'cause,
you know, I... Okay, fine.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.553
Two words...
Energy water.

25:56.722 --> 26:00.225
Are you kidding me?

26:00.392 --> 26:01.643
Greg Duffy?

26:01.810 --> 26:05.271
I guess he was in a car
accident the other day
that you guys responded to?

26:05.439 --> 26:06.522
Yeah. What about him?

26:06.690 --> 26:07.899
He's outside.

26:14.698 --> 26:15.865
Sir.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.160
Sorry to barge in
on you like this,

26:19.328 --> 26:23.706
but my wife made this
for you guys.

26:23.874 --> 26:26.167
We really appreciate
what you did.

26:26.335 --> 26:28.378
And we know damn well
it could have been worse

26:28.545 --> 26:30.255
if the car had
tipped over. So...

26:30.422 --> 26:31.798
Thank you.

26:31.966 --> 26:33.132
Sure
Sure.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.300
Sure.

26:35.636 --> 26:36.886
How's your son?

26:37.888 --> 26:39.264
Yeah...

26:39.431 --> 26:40.848
Well, you know,

26:42.726 --> 26:45.812
Mikey's got a tough road
ahead of him,

26:45.980 --> 26:47.981
but we're gonna
make it.

26:49.233 --> 26:51.192
We're gonna be all right.

26:54.822 --> 26:57.657
The other reason
I came here is,

26:57.825 --> 27:01.119
I don't know if there's
anything you guys do

27:01.287 --> 27:05.748
in terms of what you saw
or piece together

27:05.916 --> 27:07.875
based on what
the accident scene
looked like,

27:08.043 --> 27:11.629
but the police report
came back

27:12.756 --> 27:14.924
saying I ran a red light,
causing the accident.

27:15.092 --> 27:19.762
And that's... that's...
That's not what happened.

27:23.726 --> 27:27.687
And I'm kind of
at a loss in terms
of how to fight it.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.536
Last paragraph.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.374
"Visibly drunk.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.710
"Smelled alcohol
on his breath.

27:50.878 --> 27:53.755
"Saw open containers
on the passenger seat."

28:05.142 --> 28:07.268
Leaders lead
from the front.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.701
Oh, there he is,
that prick.

28:23.869 --> 28:27.080
Oh, they will let
just about anybody
in this place.

28:27.247 --> 28:29.332
I got an urgent call
from HQ

28:29.500 --> 28:31.417
saying you guys
didn't know your asses
from a drip torch.

28:31.585 --> 28:33.252
They wanted me
to come down and
show you how it's done.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.838
Oh, come on, tell me about
all that action you get
out there in the suburbs?

28:36.006 --> 28:38.841
Ah! Don't start now!

28:39.009 --> 28:41.886
Hey, so how's Nicki doing
for you there?

28:42.054 --> 28:43.346
Well, she's great, Al.

28:43.514 --> 28:46.099
She works hard,
no drama, always got
a positive attitude.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.559
Fits right in.
Everybody loves her.
Ah, good, good.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.853
Hey, I appreciate
you doing this
for me, buddy.

28:51.021 --> 28:52.105
Ain't no thang.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.982
Is she around?
I told her
I'd pick her up.

29:01.824 --> 29:04.867
Our rig,
it's got a cylinder on it
that keeps on cracking.

29:05.035 --> 29:07.328
Thirteen years old,
can't get us
a new one.

29:07.496 --> 29:10.540
Come out to Naperville.
We get a new rig
every three years.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.083
In the 'burbs.

29:14.128 --> 29:15.503
Leave it on.

29:18.215 --> 29:19.757
Any of you all
seen Nicki?

29:19.925 --> 29:21.926
Haven't, Chief.
Sorry.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.095
I'll check the kitchen.
Be right back.
All right.

29:27.933 --> 29:28.850
Hi, Dad!

29:29.017 --> 29:30.184
Hey.
You're here early.

29:30.352 --> 29:32.186
Zero traffic on the Ike,
if you can believe it.

29:32.354 --> 29:33.938
Oh.
Oh!

29:34.940 --> 29:37.859
You ready, kiddo?
Yeah. Yeah, I...

29:38.026 --> 29:39.819
I'm just gonna go
grab my stuff.
All right, sweetheart.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.195
Great.

29:59.089 --> 30:01.966
Hey. I need
to talk to you.
Hey.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.927
That girl is
in serious heat
and I'm not Gandhi.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.471
What? No.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.097
About your arm. Here.
Oh.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.893
What's this?
A friend of mine.
I gave her a heads up.

30:13.103 --> 30:13.769
Cool. Thanks.

30:13.937 --> 30:15.980
Yeah, your appointment's
after shift.

30:17.107 --> 30:18.483
You said
you were gonna get
your arm looked at.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.194
I know. I am.
I will. I...

30:21.361 --> 30:22.820
I am.

30:22.988 --> 30:24.572
Okay, so,
I basically feel like

30:24.740 --> 30:26.741
you've been lying to me
in order to get pain killers,

30:26.909 --> 30:30.620
and that's not really
a quality I look for in
a friend and a roommate.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.667
Part of me doesn't
want to know.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.795
I get it.

30:39.963 --> 30:42.798
Of course.
But the consultation's
off the books.

30:42.966 --> 30:46.219
Just you and I will know.
And we'll figure it out.

30:47.721 --> 30:49.013
All right.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.308
Okay.

30:57.606 --> 30:58.564
Hey, Casey.

30:58.732 --> 31:01.108
What's up?

31:01.276 --> 31:04.820
I just wanted to let
you know that I reached
my Squad certification.

31:04.988 --> 31:05.988
Okay.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.408
And I put in for a transfer.

31:11.662 --> 31:14.080
So I just wanted you
to know beforehand.

31:23.340 --> 31:24.590
Vargas.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.388
Congratulations, man.
Seriously.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.474
Severide will be
lucky to have you.

31:35.269 --> 31:37.270
I appreciate that.

31:37.437 --> 31:38.896
Thank you.

31:50.701 --> 31:52.159
You Casey?

31:53.245 --> 31:54.412
Yeah.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.122
I'm Hank Voight.

32:01.211 --> 32:02.795
Got time for a drink?

32:09.261 --> 32:12.805
A lot of cops got
dinosaur arms when it comes
to pulling their guns.

32:12.973 --> 32:13.764
Not me.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.808
I've always
been aggressive.

32:15.976 --> 32:18.060
It's the only way
to get anything done
in my line of work.

32:24.318 --> 32:26.986
The reason
I'm telling you this is...

32:28.238 --> 32:29.947
I've put a lot of time
into my job.

32:30.115 --> 32:33.659
I cared about
protecting this city
and the people in it.

32:35.329 --> 32:37.330
Maybe too much,
'cause...

32:38.540 --> 32:41.667
I wasn't home a lot
and I took my eye
off my son.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.879
That's on me.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.465
But I am telling you
right now,

32:47.633 --> 32:49.759
I am gonna be
up that kid's ass

32:49.926 --> 32:50.718
until he gets
his head on straight.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.762
I'm gonna get him
in a program,
the whole deal.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.597
You got my word on it.

32:54.765 --> 32:56.307
Good to hear.

32:58.018 --> 33:00.811
You know, the thing is,
Justin... That's my son...

33:02.773 --> 33:04.815
He's got
some priors.

33:05.817 --> 33:06.859
And this thing
that happened
the other night,

33:07.027 --> 33:09.945
if there was
alcohol involved,
that's a felony

33:10.113 --> 33:11.906
and he does time.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.533
Real time.

33:15.577 --> 33:16.827
Have you ever
been to lock up?

33:16.995 --> 33:19.872
You been to Statesville?
You been to these places?

33:20.040 --> 33:23.292
You don't want
your kid there,
trust me.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.336
I'm sympathetic, but...

33:26.505 --> 33:27.838
That's got nothing
to do with me.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.091
Sure it does.

33:30.258 --> 33:33.260
You filed a report
that said my son
was drunk that night.

33:33.428 --> 33:34.512
He was.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.931
Well, I need you
to retract it.

33:37.099 --> 33:38.766
Let me tell ya,

33:40.018 --> 33:42.561
I will owe you,
big time.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.980
And I'm a good guy
to have a favor
banked with.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.982
The kid in
the other car...

33:47.150 --> 33:48.818
Did you know
he's paralyzed?

33:48.985 --> 33:51.487
Yeah, and it breaks
my heart.

33:53.365 --> 33:56.951
But there is no sense
having two tragedies
coming from that night.

33:57.119 --> 33:59.995
And putting ten years
on my son would
be a tragedy

34:00.163 --> 34:01.914
'cause he's a great guy.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.961
I've been
to Statesville.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.507
Have you ever been
to a spinal injury center?

34:13.260 --> 34:14.552
Where the family
watches their kid

34:14.720 --> 34:17.471
drag his feet
while gripping some
parallel bars,

34:17.639 --> 34:21.267
clinging to the fantasy
that he'll walk again
one day?

34:21.435 --> 34:24.478
And the dad quits his job
to help the mom care for him

34:24.646 --> 34:27.565
and take a second mortgage
out on their house
to pay for it?

34:27.733 --> 34:29.859
And on top of that,

34:30.026 --> 34:31.777
they have to
live with the shame
that the police

34:31.945 --> 34:34.530
and fire departments shoved
a lie down their throat

34:34.698 --> 34:36.949
that they caused
the accident?

34:39.244 --> 34:40.411
What you're asking me
to do...

34:40.579 --> 34:42.037
I'm not asking!

34:44.541 --> 34:47.752
If you're not
the kind of man
to do a cop a favor,

34:48.795 --> 34:51.922
then I can take this
to the next level
real easy.

34:53.508 --> 34:55.259
It was the end
of your shift,
you were tired,

34:55.427 --> 34:57.970
you got your paperwork
mixed up, you got
your calls mixed up.

34:58.138 --> 34:59.930
There's a million excuses.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.850
Pick one.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.268
Because believe me,

35:05.312 --> 35:07.188
you are gonna
retract that statement.

35:08.732 --> 35:11.525
'Cause if you don't,
I swear to God...

35:15.322 --> 35:16.530
Casey.

35:16.698 --> 35:17.740
Chief.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.625
Hey, Chief, can you
give us a minute?

35:27.793 --> 35:30.211
It's kind of
a private conversation.

35:32.839 --> 35:34.173
No. I'm good.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.956
I'm not changing a word.

36:13.380 --> 36:17.633
Honestly, I don't know
how you're walking around
right now, let alone working.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.510
What happened?

36:19.678 --> 36:22.054
Job-related.
I figured it was just
a pinched nerve.

36:22.222 --> 36:23.472
It is.

36:23.640 --> 36:27.101
Caused by a fracture
in your C-5 vertebra.
Right here.

36:30.355 --> 36:31.480
Okay.

36:38.780 --> 36:42.032
You're lucky that
you can feel pain
at all right now.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.869
But, there's a surgery
which can take pressure
off the nerve, and...

36:45.036 --> 36:46.704
How long would
I be off work?

36:46.872 --> 36:48.497
Full rehab is six months
to a year.

36:48.665 --> 36:50.082
How about
without the surgery?

36:50.250 --> 36:53.919
We're dealing with motor
nerve damage, so there's
no definitive timetable

36:54.087 --> 36:56.297
but you can expect
weakness of the hands,

36:56.464 --> 36:58.507
you can expect
muscle atrophy.

36:58.675 --> 37:00.801
And then,
if it deteriorates,

37:00.969 --> 37:02.386
fasciculation.

37:03.513 --> 37:05.472
Twitching of the hands,
of the knees.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.142
After that, you don't
want to know.

37:15.108 --> 37:16.025
My brother called,

37:16.192 --> 37:19.111
asked if you were sure
about what you were doing.

37:19.279 --> 37:20.946
I told him,
"You don't know
Casey very well."

37:24.451 --> 37:26.076
You holding up all right?

37:26.244 --> 37:27.703
Yeah, yeah.

37:28.705 --> 37:29.830
Good.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.045
What would
you have done?

37:39.799 --> 37:42.676
I... You know,
I went back
and forth on this.

37:43.970 --> 37:46.597
Especially with Antonio
in my ear, but...

37:48.767 --> 37:50.476
You want to know
the honest answer?

37:51.770 --> 37:52.895
Yeah.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.317
If I held that information
out of the report,

37:58.485 --> 38:01.779
I thought about how
I'd feel looking people
I respect in the eye.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.950
You know, and I guess
specifically I thought

38:06.117 --> 38:08.869
about how I'd feel
looking you in the eye.

38:15.210 --> 38:18.337
That's when I knew
I would have done
the right thing.

38:27.722 --> 38:31.600
300, 320, 340...

38:31.768 --> 38:34.186
$344.

38:34.354 --> 38:36.063
We found a 32-inch
over in Roscoe Village.

38:36.231 --> 38:38.524
The guy says
it's barely been used.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.612
I got a better idea.

38:53.123 --> 38:54.206
What's that?

38:54.374 --> 38:56.208
Well, you asked
for a level.

38:56.376 --> 38:57.543
That's a T-square.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.421
Just...
Oh.

39:00.588 --> 39:02.297
Go.
Okay.

39:14.102 --> 39:17.062
Hey.

39:17.230 --> 39:20.607
So, how'd it go?

39:20.775 --> 39:22.443
Good. Nice lady.

39:23.737 --> 39:26.030
Just gotta find a way
to manage the pain.

39:26.197 --> 39:30.325
Yeah, Kendra said
you basically have
a broken neck.

39:30.493 --> 39:33.787
Well, if the two
of you already talked,
then why are you asking me?

39:39.169 --> 39:42.129
I get that surgery,
there's follow-up exams.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.131
There's paperwork
involved.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.593
The department
doesn't like how it looks,
I go on Long Term Disability.

39:47.761 --> 39:49.344
At 75% pay.

39:49.512 --> 39:50.846
And then do what, Shay?

39:51.014 --> 39:52.848
Fish off Navy Pier
for the next 20 years?

39:56.686 --> 39:59.688
Working Squad is
all I wanted.
It's all I have.

40:01.191 --> 40:03.108
If I have to eat the pain,
then I will.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.867
Who's that?

40:15.622 --> 40:17.247
Hey.
Remember me?

40:18.875 --> 40:21.376
I do.

40:21.544 --> 40:23.045
Nicki's engaged.

40:26.049 --> 40:29.718
Besides, it looks like
you're already having
your fun there.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.515
Does this conversation
need to continue?

40:34.682 --> 40:36.100
No, sir. It doesn't.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.476
Right.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.902
There you have it.

40:56.871 --> 40:59.164
Bears game
starts in an hour.

40:59.332 --> 41:01.333
Is there a decent
spot around here
to watch it?

41:01.501 --> 41:03.335
Not too crowded,
not too loud,

41:03.503 --> 41:05.254
and we can get seats?

41:05.421 --> 41:06.296
Yeah.

41:07.507 --> 41:08.882
Yeah, I know a place.

41:09.050 --> 41:10.884
Bring it down,
we're going inside someplace.

41:11.052 --> 41:13.387
- Go easy, guys.
- Mom, hey.

41:13.555 --> 41:16.723
This looks like a mom!
This looks like a mom!
Am I right?

41:16.891 --> 41:18.267
You're right.
Welcome.
Ah.

41:18.434 --> 41:20.352
That's Herrmann, Mom.
Herrmann, right.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.271
Hello, Mother.
And Mouch.

41:22.438 --> 41:23.689
Mouch.
Mouch?

41:23.857 --> 41:25.482
Mouch.
You'll get used to it.
Nice to meet you.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.360
Otis, nice to meet you.
Hi, it's Brian.
It's Brian.

41:28.528 --> 41:29.194
Brian.
Yes.

41:29.362 --> 41:32.072
Jose, it's a pleasure.
Welcome. Welcome.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.283
This is my boss, Mom.
This is Lieutenant Casey.

41:34.450 --> 41:37.161
Lieutenant Casey,
it's so great to have
you guys here.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.370
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.124
And, hey, oh,
this is my sister Elise.
Hey!

41:42.292 --> 41:43.292
Hello!
Cheers.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.294
Really?

41:45.461 --> 41:47.296
Hey, can I talk
to you a moment?
Yeah.

41:49.299 --> 41:52.301
I don't sleep at night
when he's on shift.

41:54.804 --> 41:57.014
I'll look after him.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.849
Promise.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.059
Mouch, turn on
the TV. Let's go.

42:02.645 --> 42:03.687
All right,
cheers, cheers.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.814
Okay, you guys,
make yourselves
at home.

42:05.982 --> 42:07.399
All right!
We're gonna
bring some food out.

42:07.567 --> 42:08.901
And food!

42:11.529 --> 42:12.696
She's fast.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.701
This just keeps
getting better.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.411
Welcome to Soldier Field.

42:19.579 --> 42:21.496
I really want
my Honey Bears back.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.582
That's what I want.

42:23.750 --> 42:25.375
Twenty-five years.
