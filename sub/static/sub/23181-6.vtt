00:11.933 --> 00:13.433
You're having thirsty Thursday

00:13.466 --> 00:15.133
with your pals the other day.

00:16.566 --> 00:19.233
It was my cousin's sixth
birthday party yesterday.

00:19.266 --> 00:21.100
‐Which cousin?
‐Samuel.

00:21.133 --> 00:22.466
I fuckin' hate Samuel.

00:22.500 --> 00:25.566
‐Well, Samuel likes you.
‐Fuckin' hate Samuel so much.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.300
Well, Samuel's not so bad.

00:27.333 --> 00:29.633
I seen Samuel in the laundry
room with the cat one time.

00:29.666 --> 00:30.700
You just know
that little fucker's

00:30.733 --> 00:32.233
gonna put him in the dryer.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.600
That's a hasty conclusion.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.466
Not if you seen
Samuel trying to put himself

00:35.500 --> 00:37.200
in there 15 minutes earlier.

00:37.233 --> 00:39.466
I seen Samuel snort a line of
Fun Dip on his fifth birthday.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.700
Well, it's reason
fuckin' five million

00:40.733 --> 00:42.200
I didn't go to his
sixth birthday party.

00:42.233 --> 00:44.633
He was doing
a Fun Dip dry rip.

00:44.666 --> 00:45.733
A what?

00:45.766 --> 00:47.633
Or rippsin' a Fun Dip dry one.

00:47.666 --> 00:49.066
Well, what's that?

00:49.100 --> 00:51.266
Well, in schneef terms,

00:51.300 --> 00:52.400
if you do a line of schneef
before you've ingested

00:52.433 --> 00:54.366
any booze to
alter your judgment,

00:54.400 --> 00:55.466
it's called doing a dry rip.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.666
Or rippsin' a dry one.

00:56.700 --> 00:58.066
Doin' dry rips is
a pretty good indication

00:58.100 --> 00:59.366
you got a schneef problem.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.066
You got yourselves
a schneef issue.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.500
Well, yous
ever done a dry rip?

01:02.533 --> 01:04.100
‐Well, back in the day.
‐In the glory days.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.033
‐Yeah, I done a dry rip.
‐I'd a rips a dry one.

01:09.333 --> 01:11.733
Not sure if rippin'
a Fun dip dry rip would

01:11.766 --> 01:13.133
have the same effect,

01:13.166 --> 01:14.700
but doin' it is still
a pretty good indication

01:14.733 --> 01:16.100
you got some sort of problem.

01:16.133 --> 01:17.266
Well, hoopin' Fun Dip

01:17.300 --> 01:18.733
definitely wouldn't
have the same effects,

01:18.766 --> 01:20.133
but it's
definitely an indication

01:20.166 --> 01:21.566
you got yourselves a problem.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.100
Well, what's hoopin'?

01:23.133 --> 01:25.566
Well, that's instead of taking
the drugs orally's or

01:25.600 --> 01:28.033
intranasally's, you
take 'em anally's.

01:28.066 --> 01:29.566
What the fuck
you talking about now?

01:29.600 --> 01:31.800
Well, instead of down
the hatch or up the nose,

01:31.833 --> 01:33.700
you take 'em in the pooper.

01:33.733 --> 01:35.366
Wait, you put
drugs up your pooper?

01:35.400 --> 01:36.466
That's the fastest
way to absorbs

01:36.500 --> 01:38.466
'em into your systems.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.066
Do you mean like you take
the drugs with your hand...

01:42.400 --> 01:43.766
Well, then you put
'em up your pooper?

01:43.800 --> 01:45.200
Correct.

01:45.233 --> 01:46.466
But you don't poop 'em out?

01:46.500 --> 01:48.033
No, your pooper absorbs 'em.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.166
Well, isn't that curious.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.700
Hoopin' Fun Dip definitely

01:50.733 --> 01:53.300
wouldn't have the same
effect as hoopin' schneef.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.366
But doing it is still probably
a pretty good indication

01:55.400 --> 01:56.700
you got some
sort of a problem.

01:56.733 --> 01:58.733
I guess a Fun Dip dick dinger

01:58.766 --> 02:00.400
wouldn't be
the ends of the world.

02:00.433 --> 02:02.066
You wanna know what? I heard
my friends J. P. and J. W.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.233
talk about Fun Dip
dick dingers one time.

02:04.266 --> 02:05.533
Well, whose dick
was gettin' dinged?

02:05.566 --> 02:07.133
Well, I thought it was
a bit intrusive to ask

02:07.166 --> 02:08.433
whose dick was gettin' dinged.

02:08.466 --> 02:10.433
As long as they're
both consentin' adults,

02:10.466 --> 02:12.333
it really doesn't matter
whose dick's gettin' dinged.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.766
Well, I really hope
the Fun Dip candy stick

02:13.800 --> 02:15.233
isn't going
to waste in all this.

02:15.266 --> 02:16.533
Do you wanna know what?

02:16.566 --> 02:18.333
I pulled my first all‐nighter
with my friend Chad

02:18.366 --> 02:20.466
in grade eight playing
Pokemans and eating Fun Dip.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.533
Oh, waits.

02:22.333 --> 02:24.200
If...

02:24.233 --> 02:25.366
If Samuel's
already been takin'

02:25.400 --> 02:28.100
Fun Dips orally's
and intranasally's...

02:32.133 --> 02:33.200
Yeah, we should probably
go check on Samuel.

02:38.366 --> 02:39.766
I fuckin' hate Samuel so much.

02:40.666 --> 02:42.666
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:59.400 --> 03:00.733
You got any dates lined up
this week, good buddy?

03:00.766 --> 03:02.233
Nah, I'm gonna
put that bullshit

03:02.266 --> 03:03.266
on the back burner
for a bit, bud.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.300
Soft, literally.

03:05.333 --> 03:06.733
Parks 'er behind
the barn for a bits?

03:06.766 --> 03:08.466
‐Ten‐ply.
‐No.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.133
Gotta find Stormy a stud.
That's a priority.

03:11.166 --> 03:12.233
She's a beautiful dog.

03:12.266 --> 03:13.400
Oh, she's a real beauty.

03:13.433 --> 03:14.600
No, she's a gorgeous dog.

03:14.633 --> 03:16.233
She just tries to kill
her studs, is the thing.

03:16.266 --> 03:18.033
Well, that's my girl.

03:18.066 --> 03:19.733
Maybe you should takes her
in for a fingers in the bum.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.600
Are you fuckin' preoccupied?

03:21.633 --> 03:24.066
That's only
the answer sometimes.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.533
Squirrelly Dan
working' Squirrelly OT.

03:25.566 --> 03:26.600
Not all the time.

03:26.633 --> 03:28.233
‐Just to checks.
‐Sometimes.

03:28.266 --> 03:30.466
Are you fuckin' preoccupied?

03:30.500 --> 03:32.400
Doesn't matter what
you takes her in for.

03:32.433 --> 03:34.133
As sure as a bush
is gonna break your fall,

03:34.166 --> 03:35.633
Stormy's gonna get
some fingers in the bum.

03:35.666 --> 03:37.500
‐How deep?
‐Fuck's sake.

03:37.533 --> 03:39.533
‐What do ya means, how deep?
‐How many knuckles?

03:39.566 --> 03:41.266
Like how many knuckles deep?

03:41.300 --> 03:42.133
Yeah, are we talking
about a one‐knuckler

03:42.166 --> 03:43.233
or a two‐knuckler?

03:43.266 --> 03:44.333
Oh, be at least
a three‐knuckler

03:44.366 --> 03:45.400
to gets to the bottom of this.

03:45.433 --> 03:46.333
Oh, see, now, that's too many.

03:46.366 --> 03:47.600
Is not.

03:47.633 --> 03:49.200
Well, a person's
got two knuckles

03:49.233 --> 03:50.366
so you're saying that
the vet would have to

03:50.400 --> 03:51.800
fire a three‐knuckler
up Stormy's bum

03:51.833 --> 03:53.233
to get to the bottom of it?

03:53.266 --> 03:54.500
A person has three knuckles.

03:54.533 --> 03:56.033
Well, a person
has two knuckles.

03:56.066 --> 03:57.566
‐Figure it out.
‐A person has three knuckles.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.266
You figure it out.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.266
A person's got
two knuckles, okay?

04:01.300 --> 04:03.500
‐One, two.
‐Three.

04:03.533 --> 04:04.733
You forgots about
the little knuckles

04:04.766 --> 04:06.500
underneath the fingernails.

04:06.533 --> 04:07.666
Well, see now, that's not
a knuckle, though, Dan.

04:07.700 --> 04:08.600
To be a knuckle,
you gotta be able to

04:08.633 --> 04:10.433
punch somebody with it.

04:10.466 --> 04:11.466
You can't punch
somebody with the knuckle

04:11.500 --> 04:12.133
underneath the
fingernail, can you?

04:12.166 --> 04:13.366
Can too.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.533
Well, you'll be
looking pretty fuckin' silly.

04:15.566 --> 04:18.733
First knuckle, one knuckler.
Second knuckle, two‐knuckler.

04:18.766 --> 04:21.133
Third knuckle, three‐knuckler.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.300
So then by your logic
the vet would have to

04:22.333 --> 04:24.033
fire a full
finger up Stormy's bum

04:24.066 --> 04:25.466
‐to get to the bottom of it.
‐Correct.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.433
See, I'm just not so
goddamn sure I can stand by

04:27.466 --> 04:29.433
and watch the vet give Stormy
a three‐knuckler up the bum.

04:29.466 --> 04:30.533
No, I don't think
Stormy would need

04:30.566 --> 04:31.500
a three‐knuckler up the bum.

04:31.533 --> 04:32.800
Well, thank you, Dary,
because then you'd think

04:32.833 --> 04:34.566
the vet's a bit funny,
would you not?

04:34.600 --> 04:36.033
Mmm, a person has
three knuckles, though.

04:36.066 --> 04:37.000
Thank you, Dary.

04:37.033 --> 04:38.400
Fuck's sake, go ahead
and have a fuckin' fight

04:38.433 --> 04:39.700
with your first knuckle then.

04:39.733 --> 04:42.266
KATY: You'll be lookin'
pretty fuckin' silly.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.500
Yeah, but when we're
talkin' about a two‐knuckler,

04:43.533 --> 04:45.466
we're talking about
horizontal knuckles.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.400
I'm gonna stop you there.

04:47.233 --> 04:48.633
By your logic,

04:48.666 --> 04:52.200
a six‐knuckler can be dealt
with using these two fingers?

04:52.233 --> 04:54.233
‐Correct.
‐Incorrect.

04:54.266 --> 04:56.566
No such thing
as a six‐knuckler.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.500
A six‐knuckler existed,
I'd know about it.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.133
‐How are ya now, Gail?
‐Good, and you?

05:01.166 --> 05:03.466
‐Not so bad.
‐Got a stud for Stormy.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.466

Baumgartner breeders.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.233

05:07.266 --> 05:08.700
‐Ken Baumgartner?
‐Yeah.

05:10.233 --> 05:12.066
Okay.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.800
You're not exposed
to give dogs human names.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.300
‐Can do what I want.
‐Well, sure you can,

05:15.333 --> 05:17.133
I'm just sayin'
you're not exposed to.

05:17.166 --> 05:18.600

breeding German Shepherds

mix up the egg whites

a knife or a small spatula

06:22.433 --> 06:24.566
through the batter releasing
air bubbles and bake?

we're talking
about her right now so...

15:02.625 --> 15:03.991
We're speaking
of her to try to make it

so she isn't "she we
do not speak about" anymore.

that even okay, buddy?

Got the perfect
stud for Stormy.

18:57.858 --> 19:00.758
My cousin up in Tobermory
will be here with him later.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.291
This dog is different.

19:02.325 --> 19:03.891
Strong, silent type.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.658
Hard worker. No bullshit.

‐Sounds like a good guy.

19:07.591 --> 19:08.658
Sounds like a real good guy.

19:08.691 --> 19:09.925
Probably a real good guy.

19:09.958 --> 19:11.458
‐This is the one, cowboy.
‐Okay.

19:11.491 --> 19:13.525
You can trust this old goat.

19:13.558 --> 19:14.958
So your cousin's coming up
later with the stud?

19:14.991 --> 19:15.791
Yeah.

19:17.358 --> 19:18.691
What are we
gonna do till then?

19:18.725 --> 19:20.425
Ah, you're fuckin'
lookin' at it, super chief.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.558

We'd hoover some schneef.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.125
You wanna know what?
I feel like

19:27.158 --> 19:28.458
yous been working
your way towards this

19:28.491 --> 19:29.891
for about six weeks.

19:29.925 --> 19:30.925
It's been a long, long time

19:30.958 --> 19:32.691
since I've
hoovered some schneef.

19:32.725 --> 19:34.458
'Cause you were a fuckin'
degen when you did, Dan.

19:34.491 --> 19:36.625
‐I was skinny.
‐And here's another thing.

19:36.658 --> 19:37.991
You shouldn't
call it "schneef" anymore.

19:38.025 --> 19:39.625
I think you
should call it "schniff."

19:39.658 --> 19:40.691
‐Why?
‐'Cause it's funnier.

19:41.525 --> 19:43.325
I think.

19:43.358 --> 19:45.391
It's kinda like
that word "queef."

19:45.425 --> 19:47.591
See, you can have a lot
of fun with that word queef.

19:47.625 --> 19:51.458
But what's funnier, well,
I think, is the word "quiff."

19:51.491 --> 19:52.958
I could hoover
a bit of schneef.

19:52.991 --> 19:54.491
